00:06.400 --> 00:08.967
NARRATOR: On this episode of
Life Below Zero,

00:09.000 --> 00:10.933
Alaskans race to
arm themselves

00:10.967 --> 00:13.000
against the onslaught
of winter.

00:14.300 --> 00:17.833
GLENN: I got a problem here.
This doesn't look good.

00:17.867 --> 00:21.333
The Hailstone girls take aim
at a crucial harvest.

00:22.133 --> 00:23.433
That one, big one.

00:23.467 --> 00:27.300
Sue's livelihood is threatened
by a nearby predator.

00:27.333 --> 00:30.633
SUE: There was a bear sighting
just a few hundred yards away.

00:30.667 --> 00:33.233
NARRATOR: A vital repair
puts Andy on edge.

00:34.767 --> 00:37.067
ANDY: It doesn't take much
to take a tumble.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.767
And Glenn
climbs to great heights

00:38.800 --> 00:41.467
to protect
an essential food source.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.433
GLENN: If I fell down,
it would be a painful death.

00:43.467 --> 00:44.467
Whoa!

01:02.667 --> 01:07.167
SUE: Everybody feels
it's going to be an extremely
aggressive bear year.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.100
As a human,
boy, am I under the gun.

01:09.133 --> 01:10.533
You know,
I better be packing heat

01:10.567 --> 01:12.533
and I better be keeping
my head on a swivel.

01:12.567 --> 01:15.167
I've got, this time of year,
a lot of hunters out here.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.167
The nature of hunting,
you shoot the animal,

01:17.200 --> 01:18.667
there's blood on the ground.

01:18.700 --> 01:22.100
Bears have an extremely
keen sense of smell.

01:22.133 --> 01:23.733
The bears
are getting drawn in.

01:23.767 --> 01:25.967
NARRATOR: With bear season
three days away,

01:26.067 --> 01:28.067
Sue Aikens cannot shoot a bear

01:28.067 --> 01:31.267
unless it's an immediate
threat to camp.

01:31.300 --> 01:34.700
SUE: Right now, it's not
open hunting season for them.

01:34.733 --> 01:35.900
Very soon it is.

01:35.933 --> 01:38.567
When it is then I can turn
the tables and go on the hunt.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.733
Until then,
I've got to be protective.

01:52.233 --> 01:53.933
I've been here 12 years.

01:53.967 --> 01:57.233
I know pretty much every bush
and what it looks like
in every season,

01:57.267 --> 01:59.133
visually, for miles.

01:59.167 --> 02:02.767
If there's something out of
the ordinary, I'll pick it up.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.200
You know, for me,

02:06.067 --> 02:07.133
right here.

02:07.167 --> 02:08.900
That's the camp
I'm protecting.

02:08.933 --> 02:11.500
You have tents and campers
that have every right

02:11.533 --> 02:15.667
to enjoy Alaska
and hunt for their meat.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.633
As an owner
and as a good human being,

02:18.667 --> 02:20.700
I wanna see that
they do it safely.

02:25.800 --> 02:26.800
All right.

02:29.100 --> 02:30.600
A prime example,

02:30.633 --> 02:32.800
I'll get out and show you,
this is...

02:35.433 --> 02:38.067
Twenty yards from
where I pump water.

02:38.067 --> 02:42.833
This is, as uncomfortable
as it is for me,

02:42.867 --> 02:48.100
exactly where I got attacked
and drug up into the tundra.

02:48.133 --> 02:51.900
About five, six years ago,
a smart bear who was
hiding in the cut bank

02:51.933 --> 02:53.433
and reached out
and snatched me,

02:53.467 --> 02:55.067
and was just rolling
me around.

02:55.100 --> 02:57.967
And you can still feel
here and here

02:58.067 --> 02:59.367
where his teeth
went into my head.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.067
The hips were torn
out of the socket

03:01.067 --> 03:03.667
and he slipped out
over the bank.

03:03.700 --> 03:05.133
The hips did not hold

03:05.167 --> 03:09.233
and I ended up
having to drag myself up
from halfway across the river,

03:09.267 --> 03:11.633
um, and got inside.

03:11.667 --> 03:13.100
And I just had to lay here.

03:13.133 --> 03:15.300
And it took ten days
for somebody to find me.

03:15.333 --> 03:16.700
You cannot live here
and do this

03:16.733 --> 03:19.367
without accepting your place
in the food chain.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.667
There's the bottom,
there's the top,

03:21.700 --> 03:23.600
and I'm somewhere around here.

03:23.633 --> 03:25.667
I have to go relive
old memories.

03:25.700 --> 03:28.633
See, you've got
two separate bear prints here.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.300
A littler print
and a bigger print.

03:30.333 --> 03:33.900
You know, obviously a little
bear highway going on here.

03:33.933 --> 03:35.767
But it doesn't make me
very comfortable.

03:35.800 --> 03:39.467
This is pretty fresh.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.833
He's big enough,

03:40.867 --> 03:45.533
definitely I'm spreading
my little fingers wide
to match up with him.

03:45.567 --> 03:47.833
Looks like he's doing
the same damn thing
the other one did

03:47.867 --> 03:51.167
is just hanging out here
waiting for an opportunity
to snatch me

03:51.200 --> 03:52.633
when I'm getting water.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.700
So that's kind of
not too comfortable.

03:56.133 --> 04:00.533
It's also only 100 yards away,
if that, from the campers.

04:00.567 --> 04:02.733
So I definitely need
to let them know.

04:05.633 --> 04:07.233
GLENN: This is the last place
in the world

04:07.267 --> 04:09.167
where I could
live this lifestyle.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.067
I enjoy the autonomy
it affords.

04:11.067 --> 04:13.133
I enjoy the confidence
it demands.

04:13.167 --> 04:15.367
I like the connection
to nature I feel

04:15.400 --> 04:17.067
when I live the way I do here.

04:30.267 --> 04:32.300
Landed in a great spot.
It's dry here.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.333
I'll be able to work
on them right here.

04:36.367 --> 04:38.567
NARRATOR: Having recently
harvested a moose.

04:38.600 --> 04:39.867
(GUN FIRING)

04:39.900 --> 04:43.067
Glenn only has a short time
before the kill goes bad.

04:44.667 --> 04:46.667
When I take a piece off,

04:46.700 --> 04:49.467
I have to have
some place to put it
where it's gonna stay clean.

04:50.333 --> 04:53.067
So I'm cutting a few
spruce trees

04:53.100 --> 04:56.200
in order to make a rack
to set meat on.

05:01.733 --> 05:05.467
Making some initial cuts
in the hide.

05:05.500 --> 05:09.300
It's a very heavy hide
and it's very tight
on the carcass.

05:15.833 --> 05:20.233
What I need to be
concerned about now
is salvaging this meat,

05:20.267 --> 05:23.067
but, the job's
just getting started.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.900
It's all about
meat preservation,
meat quality.

05:34.933 --> 05:36.333
That's why it's important,

05:36.367 --> 05:39.633
if possible,
to kill an animal
with one shot.

05:41.433 --> 05:42.667
(GRUNTS)

05:42.700 --> 05:44.267
I'm gonna set it right here.

05:47.567 --> 05:49.700
I'm gonna take
the head off next.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.600
And the head of a moose
is well attached to the body.

05:53.633 --> 05:56.600
These antlers are designed
to smash into
another moose's antlers

05:56.633 --> 05:57.567
when they're fighting.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.433
So it's really sturdy,
the way it's built here.

05:59.467 --> 06:01.800
It's got really tough
tendons in here,

06:01.833 --> 06:04.667
ligaments, that I have to cut.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.433
There.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.367
Look at that.

06:10.300 --> 06:11.700
The head's coming off.

06:12.933 --> 06:14.100
There.

06:15.433 --> 06:17.067
NARRATOR:
With daylight waning,

06:17.067 --> 06:21.600
the meat must cool down
or Glenn risks losing
his kill to spoilage.

06:23.067 --> 06:24.933
GLENN: This meat
has to get cool.

06:24.967 --> 06:29.233
It's very warm in there,
and bacteria will start to
decay the meat

06:29.267 --> 06:31.167
from the inside out.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.600
See all that fat?

06:33.633 --> 06:35.167
That's what I want.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.600
If you're not eating
a lot of carbohydrates,
you have to eat a lot of fat.

06:37.633 --> 06:40.967
Because you can't live
on a huge amount of protein.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.133
If you eat too much protein
you'll get sick.

06:46.433 --> 06:48.733
This is all kidney fat.
Look at that.

06:50.667 --> 06:51.667
(GRUNTS)

06:55.767 --> 06:57.333
That's really good kidney fat.

07:00.467 --> 07:02.933
A bear will come along
or a wolverine will come along

07:02.967 --> 07:04.833
and eat this part up.

07:04.867 --> 07:06.800
Now the heart,

07:06.833 --> 07:08.433
of course, I'm keeping.

07:11.267 --> 07:13.367
The heart's really delicious.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.100
I like to cut it up
in small pieces and fry it.

07:16.133 --> 07:18.133
This heart I'll carry home
with me tonight.

07:19.533 --> 07:21.533
So the first big step
is accomplished.

07:21.567 --> 07:24.133
I got the guts out,
I got the lungs out.

07:24.167 --> 07:25.733
This meat can cool off now.

07:25.767 --> 07:28.100
And then tomorrow morning
I'll come over with my canoe,

07:28.133 --> 07:29.733
probably two trips in my canoe

07:29.767 --> 07:32.667
to get it back to camp
about a mile and a half
from here.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.867
So, I got no control over
what happens tonight.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.167
I'm just taking a chance.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.833
Hopefully, no bears
come around and eat this up,

07:39.867 --> 07:43.200
'cause if a bear comes,
it'll get all this meat
in one night.

07:45.867 --> 07:47.900
CHIP: The whole idea
is to support the family.

07:47.933 --> 07:51.567
Family is the centre
of folks' up here's,
you know, existence.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.133
It's all about family.
I kind of like that a lot.

08:08.633 --> 08:10.067
(DOG BARKING)

08:12.133 --> 08:13.667
CHIP: We're going
on a caribou hunt.

08:13.700 --> 08:16.100
We'll go upriver,
will put up a nice camp,
in, uh

08:16.133 --> 08:18.067
same place we put
for the last how many years

08:18.067 --> 08:20.133
and we're just gonna
go get our hunt on.

08:21.933 --> 08:24.200
Our idea was to
go up and get them
before they start rutting.

08:24.233 --> 08:26.200
They got a lot of fat
and when they start to rut

08:26.233 --> 08:28.267
and they herd up their cows
and their harems,

08:28.300 --> 08:30.700
they quit eating
and, uh, they'll burn that fat

08:30.733 --> 08:32.667
and their meat
will taste awful.

08:32.700 --> 08:35.067
Even a dog wouldn't eat it.

08:35.067 --> 08:37.600
Everybody in the family here
can get five caribou a day.

08:37.633 --> 08:40.267
This meat here is gonna
get us through dark winter.

08:40.300 --> 08:42.633
For us, you know,
this is one of our
most pleasurable hunts.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.167
Um, it's also
one of the most profitable.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.067
And also we don't
wound any. None get away.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.933
We don't have to
pack them across the tundra,

08:47.967 --> 08:49.267
we just do them
right in the river,

08:49.300 --> 08:52.633
and take them to the edge
and just work them.

08:52.667 --> 08:53.933
Get them home. Be happy.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.367
Settle in
and get our winter on.

09:08.067 --> 09:10.967
AGNES: This year
we're taking on
four of the girls.

09:11.067 --> 09:12.600
We're leaving one behind
to stay home

09:12.633 --> 09:15.167
and watch the house
and her grandma.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.433
So, um, this year
it's gonna require all of us.

09:18.467 --> 09:22.367
It's gonna take team work
and, um, I let the school
know that, uh, the girls,

09:22.400 --> 09:24.533
in case they don't come back
for Monday and Tuesday,

09:24.567 --> 09:27.067
they'll be out on
a subsistence leave.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.733
Which is just as good
as being in school,

09:28.767 --> 09:32.633
because they get to learn
our traditional values.

09:32.667 --> 09:36.067
And so, um, this is gonna be
a good trip for all of us.

09:37.700 --> 09:39.233
Okay.

09:39.267 --> 09:41.800
And you make sure
you guys lock the door
every time you guys go out.

09:41.833 --> 09:44.267
I love you, bun. Thank you.

09:44.300 --> 09:45.600
Catch ya later dudes!

09:48.200 --> 09:49.733
CHIP: This, for us, is a...

09:49.767 --> 09:51.733
It's an important hunt
because hopefully
they can all work,

09:51.767 --> 09:53.367
and then they'll
all work together,

09:53.400 --> 09:55.133
and they'll all see how
each other does something,

09:55.167 --> 09:56.933
and they'll learn.

09:56.967 --> 09:58.867
And it's really important
to not only learn
and participate,

09:58.900 --> 10:01.200
but to do it with their family
so they can have
a connection with the area,

10:01.233 --> 10:03.500
a connection with the animals,
and the things that we do.

10:03.533 --> 10:05.100
And whatever their life
ends up turning out,

10:05.133 --> 10:08.100
meaning, you know,
later in life, they can
always look back at this

10:08.133 --> 10:09.600
and we can have a good time.

10:11.267 --> 10:12.933
Let's put it
over here, huh?

10:12.967 --> 10:14.333
Let's put the kitchen area
and the fire

10:14.367 --> 10:15.733
and all that
shit right here

10:15.767 --> 10:17.167
where we can watch.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.400
Oh look,
I see a caribou in the willow.

10:40.767 --> 10:42.900
CHIP: This is a
humane way to hunt.

10:42.933 --> 10:45.200
You shoot them
in the back of the head.
They don't feel no pain.

10:45.233 --> 10:46.900
There's no waiting
for them to bleed out.

10:46.933 --> 10:50.100
We have to kill to eat.
There's nothing
wrong with that.

10:50.133 --> 10:51.767
Ah, my ears are ringing.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.200
Your ears are ringing?

10:57.233 --> 11:00.133
(SIGHS) Okay, kiss me.
Thank you for your work.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.567
Now I can do mine.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.800
Well, this is
what we call camp meat.

11:04.833 --> 11:07.333
This is our first bull.
Basically we'll be able
to get up in the morning

11:07.367 --> 11:10.067
and have some
caribou for breakfast.

11:12.067 --> 11:13.400
I got a good start here.

11:13.433 --> 11:15.167
Tomorrow's gonna be
a better day.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.833
I'm pretty sure that
tomorrow we'll be
seeing a lot more caribou.

11:17.867 --> 11:19.267
Yup. It's been a good day.

11:21.233 --> 11:24.200
ANDY: This is what Alaska
was built on,
that pioneer spirit.

11:24.233 --> 11:26.433
That subsistence
way of living.

11:26.467 --> 11:28.267
That traditional
way of living.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.167
And, uh,
it's slowly going away

11:30.200 --> 11:32.467
because we're really
starting to sell out.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.933
NARRATOR: As winter closes in,

11:50.967 --> 11:54.633
Andy Bassich is amidst
the most vital part
of the year,

11:54.667 --> 11:56.067
the chum run.

12:03.700 --> 12:05.633
Ah, shit!

12:05.667 --> 12:07.500
ANDY: I'll have to
stop the wheel and

12:09.067 --> 12:10.667
see if I can't fix
some of this fencing.

12:10.700 --> 12:13.433
It looks like
something's coming
loose here on one of these.

12:13.467 --> 12:14.633
I don't know.

12:14.667 --> 12:18.567
Gosh, it looks like one
of the poles just broke loose.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.233
NARRATOR: The Yukon River
current powers the fish wheel

12:21.267 --> 12:24.967
that provides the vital supply
of food for the dog team.

12:25.067 --> 12:26.433
Without it running,

12:26.467 --> 12:29.233
Andy and Kate risk losing
hundreds of fish a day.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.700
ANDY: Let me get this wheel
stopped and try to do a
Band Aid fix for right now.

12:44.867 --> 12:46.633
So, I went out
and just got a stick

12:46.667 --> 12:48.433
and stuffed it
down into the pipe

12:48.467 --> 12:51.367
and made kind of a
makeshift splint for it.

12:52.700 --> 12:55.067
A piece of this pipe broke.

12:55.067 --> 12:57.767
It's really loosened
this whole section here.

12:57.800 --> 13:02.367
And then, the wire started
breaking and popping off.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.700
This mesh is what
gives it a lot of strength.

13:04.733 --> 13:06.067
So, if I lose this mesh,

13:06.100 --> 13:09.533
then the whole wheel
doesn't have
a lot of strength to it.

13:09.567 --> 13:13.067
It's a pretty critical thing.
I can't afford to
have this be broken.

13:13.100 --> 13:15.133
Anything that's
dipping into the water

13:15.167 --> 13:18.300
six times a minute,
for 24 hours a day,

13:18.333 --> 13:20.067
there's gonna be
wear and tear on it.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.833
(CHUCKLING)
I'm forced a lot of times
to be out here,

13:24.867 --> 13:27.400
like this,
out in the middle of the river

13:28.400 --> 13:30.400
in a very dangerous position.

13:32.067 --> 13:36.333
If you fall in,
there's a potential
of being trapped underwater.

13:36.367 --> 13:38.667
Once you're under the water,
if something snags you,

13:38.700 --> 13:40.200
you bump your head,

13:41.133 --> 13:42.633
it doesn't take much
to hold you.

13:42.667 --> 13:44.167
And this water's really cold.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.367
It's probably about
42 degrees right now.

13:47.400 --> 13:51.400
So, it's not a good thing to
end up in the Yukon right now.

13:58.933 --> 14:00.667
Everything's really slimy.

14:05.667 --> 14:07.967
Once you get that
on the bottom of your boots

14:08.067 --> 14:09.800
it doesn't take much
to take a tumble.

14:12.300 --> 14:13.633
It's pretty dangerous work.

14:13.667 --> 14:16.267
I really don't like being
out here, but I have to do it.

14:17.767 --> 14:21.633
I can't afford for a day to be
down because of maintenance.

14:21.667 --> 14:24.567
This will be a kind of a
quick fix until next year.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.667
I'm glad I noticed that.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.100
That could have been a real
catastrophe tomorrow morning.

14:33.233 --> 14:35.200
The most important thing
to me right now

14:35.233 --> 14:36.633
is that this wheel
keep running.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.400
It would be nice if we could
catch 300 fish or more.

14:39.433 --> 14:42.667
To do this efficiently,
we gotta be fishing 24/7.

14:50.567 --> 14:53.767
SUE: You've gotta be an active
participant in your own life.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.500
Trust me, you're gonna be
an active participant
in your death.

14:56.533 --> 14:59.467
You know, don't make it
come too soon
by not living right.

15:14.700 --> 15:17.433
SUE: The biggest predator
is my bear population.

15:17.467 --> 15:19.300
They should be
asleep right now.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.067
They should be hibernating.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.300
They're not.
They're walking around.

15:23.333 --> 15:26.067
The longer they stay up,
the more food they need,

15:26.067 --> 15:27.867
they're burning up
their winter calories

15:27.900 --> 15:29.533
that they need
for hibernation.

15:29.567 --> 15:31.400
I'm laying out the guns

15:31.433 --> 15:34.300
that I'm gonna choose
to have in this building.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.633
In the dining hall
it was very cut and dried.

15:36.667 --> 15:39.633
I had over a decade to decide,

15:39.667 --> 15:41.133
if I'm laying in bed,

15:41.167 --> 15:43.133
this gun is always here.

15:43.167 --> 15:45.700
This gun
is the next one I grab.

15:45.733 --> 15:47.600
And it's set up for that.

15:47.633 --> 15:49.833
This is an all-new building

15:49.867 --> 15:52.967
and I...
I don't have that set up yet.

15:53.067 --> 15:54.867
So, it's disconcerting for me.

15:54.900 --> 15:58.333
I don't feel that
I'm being as proactive.

15:58.367 --> 16:01.300
So what I need to do,
set them out
and make decisions.

16:04.067 --> 16:06.333
You know, uh,
if I'm laying here

16:07.300 --> 16:08.333
and

16:09.367 --> 16:11.600
at the front
of the building...

16:11.633 --> 16:14.533
(VOCALISES ROARS),
...smash, smash, smash.

16:14.567 --> 16:16.167
You've gotta
be able to do this.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.200
I'm right-handed,
so this has to come up

16:18.233 --> 16:22.367
and I can deal with it
anywhere around here.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.500
If he's that far away,
I'm gonna have time
to grab this.

16:25.533 --> 16:28.833
So its resting place,
I have to decide,

16:28.867 --> 16:31.733
I'm thinking
I've rolled out of bed,

16:31.767 --> 16:35.067
the next thing I need to do,
it's two steps to grab it,

16:35.067 --> 16:36.500
another step to turn.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.667
I perceive my job as

16:43.700 --> 16:48.067
making sure
that Kavik camp
is as safe as it can be

16:48.067 --> 16:50.567
for anybody that wants
to come through.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.067
The clients that I have,
they provide
one hell of a service,

16:54.067 --> 16:57.133
and the service
they provide is life.

16:57.167 --> 16:59.733
They take care of me,
I take care of them.

17:01.700 --> 17:04.300
CHIP: According to
my wife's society
and her upbringing,

17:04.333 --> 17:07.133
I give her everything.
She runs the money.

17:07.167 --> 17:08.933
She goes out where
the food goes.

17:08.967 --> 17:12.133
She's, uh, in charge of
basically all of
our resources.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.067
Basically the women
are in fricking charge.

17:27.067 --> 17:28.733
CHIP: Today is already another
great family day.

17:28.767 --> 17:32.700
I got my family
kicking back and
out of the wind

17:32.733 --> 17:35.400
and we're watching
caribou doing their thing.

17:35.433 --> 17:37.167
Hopefully we'll get
some bulls out here

17:37.200 --> 17:39.067
and let the girls
take some shots,

17:39.067 --> 17:41.933
nail some caribou,
and carry on from there.

17:41.967 --> 17:43.400
We'll see how well it goes.

17:48.433 --> 17:50.400
AGNES: Down the river
on the other side

17:50.433 --> 17:52.300
they're coming down this way.

17:52.333 --> 17:54.067
Mary, maybe
you'll be the shooter.

17:54.100 --> 17:56.800
You'll be the first shooter
and then when
you're gun-empty or whatever

17:56.833 --> 17:59.800
I'll get my pistol
and try to catch
your wounded.

17:59.833 --> 18:02.800
Or um, I'll shoot and then
you'll reload your gun.

18:04.367 --> 18:07.067
NARRATOR: While the women
shoot at their targets,

18:07.067 --> 18:10.067
Chip will employ
a more traditional
hunting tool.

18:10.067 --> 18:11.600
This is something
you'd use out of a boat.

18:13.567 --> 18:16.700
We have a lance with a
pokey end and a long shaft.

18:16.733 --> 18:19.167
And you grab a hold
of the back and you shove it
through into the animal,

18:19.200 --> 18:20.900
and you hold onto it
and you withdraw the thing.

18:20.933 --> 18:24.667
This here is from
a Mosin rifle,
an old Russian surplus rifle.

18:24.700 --> 18:27.567
And I bought it for like
five bucks in Kotzebue.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.300
And it won't cost me
a single bullet.

18:30.100 --> 18:32.367
Yep. (LAUGHS) Sweet.

18:32.400 --> 18:35.100
AGNES: Oh look,
they hit the water!

18:35.133 --> 18:37.200
Chip, there's
caribou crossing.

18:37.233 --> 18:38.600
Time to go, Mary.

18:40.167 --> 18:41.367
You ready?

18:55.333 --> 18:56.800
You can't shoot
from that far, babe.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.700
You guys gotta
take care of this.

19:04.733 --> 19:05.867
Get up on this guy.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.467
Shoot it Ag, with the pistol.

19:07.967 --> 19:09.233
It is coming.

19:11.433 --> 19:12.500
Shoot it, Ag!

19:19.067 --> 19:20.233
CHIP: I got him.

19:20.933 --> 19:22.233
Right on.

19:22.267 --> 19:25.800
We got one, two, three,
four, five right here.

19:25.833 --> 19:27.833
So we just nailed six caribou.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.600
My wife and my daughter,
they got four

19:29.633 --> 19:30.633
and I lanced two of them.

19:30.667 --> 19:33.767
So, the lance works,
it's been tested.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.233
It's an awesome ride.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.167
GLENN: People have become
so civilized,

19:39.200 --> 19:42.267
part of that process
is removing ourselves

19:42.300 --> 19:45.200
from the reality
of life and death.

19:45.233 --> 19:47.467
Real events that happen.

20:07.633 --> 20:10.300
GLENN: I'm paddling
across the lake now.

20:10.333 --> 20:12.500
I got about a mile
and a quarter paddle

20:12.533 --> 20:14.667
and then I'll get over
to the far shore.

20:14.700 --> 20:17.633
And 250 yards from the shore
I got a moose down over there.

20:19.467 --> 20:22.200
I'm gonna use my sled
to move it down to the lake.

20:23.167 --> 20:25.267
It will probably
take 11 loads,

20:25.300 --> 20:28.067
over three miles of walking,

20:28.100 --> 20:32.867
and then I'm gonna
have to take
two trips with this canoe,

20:32.900 --> 20:34.600
to get that whole moose
back to camp.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.567
NARRATOR: Yesterday,
Glenn processed a moose,

20:36.600 --> 20:39.233
but was unable
to bring it back to camp.

20:39.267 --> 20:41.067
This morning,
he heads to the kill

20:41.100 --> 20:44.333
with the possibility
that scavengers
have taken the meat.

20:52.567 --> 20:55.400
Now that it's getting light,
the birds are getting active.

20:55.433 --> 20:57.800
There're at least
a few ravens over there.

20:57.833 --> 21:01.367
Those ravens, they wouldn't
normally be here.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.100
They're here
because of that kill.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.167
I'm standing up here
so I can get a look

21:07.200 --> 21:10.733
over the top of the brush
on the shoreline.

21:10.767 --> 21:13.200
Let's see if I see anything
going on back there.

21:13.233 --> 21:16.200
So far I've been very lucky
with the scavengers.

21:16.233 --> 21:17.633
I've never lost a moose yet,

21:17.667 --> 21:20.433
but there's bears
around the lake,

21:20.467 --> 21:22.700
there are a few
wolverines around,

21:22.733 --> 21:24.100
there are wolves.

21:25.067 --> 21:27.433
There's too much brush,
I can't see.

21:27.467 --> 21:29.533
I won't know
until I walk up to it.

21:40.233 --> 21:42.667
The main thing
I'm concerned about

21:42.700 --> 21:45.533
is that it's possible
a bear could have found this
during the night.

21:46.233 --> 21:47.633
Bears have a very good nose

21:47.667 --> 21:51.233
and they can smell a moose
from a long ways away.

21:51.267 --> 21:53.633
There. That's the moose.
It looks like it's okay.

21:53.667 --> 21:57.067
No bears or wolverine
or anything big
got to it last night.

21:57.933 --> 21:59.067
But there are birds on it.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.533
I gotta get over there
and start working on it

22:00.567 --> 22:02.400
cause those grey jays
will peck a lot of fat off it.

22:02.433 --> 22:04.167
-They're on it right now.
-(JAYS TWITTERING)

22:04.200 --> 22:05.567
Hey, get off that!

22:07.667 --> 22:10.467
This tarp is to keep the meat
as clean as possible.

22:11.567 --> 22:12.700
It's heavy.

22:16.467 --> 22:18.733
I gotta start sledding
this meat over to the lake.

22:18.767 --> 22:21.333
Every time I leave here,
there's a chance a bear
could come along.

22:21.367 --> 22:23.400
So, I gotta keep my rifle
with me at all times.

22:26.967 --> 22:28.733
One load down,
about ten to go.

22:34.733 --> 22:36.900
Hunting alone, that's the only
way I've ever hunted.

22:36.933 --> 22:38.500
When I first came out here,

22:38.533 --> 22:41.467
the biggest thing
I'd ever killed
was a snowshoe hare.

22:41.500 --> 22:44.267
That's been a big challenge,
just learning how to hunt.

22:44.300 --> 22:47.067
I'm sure a lot of times
I'm out here
reinventing the wheel.

22:52.633 --> 22:54.067
(GRUNTS)

22:55.467 --> 22:56.533
There it goes.

22:56.967 --> 22:58.200
Final load.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.100
That's a good feeling.

23:03.133 --> 23:04.600
Get this moose
packed out of here,

23:04.633 --> 23:06.800
salvage all of this meat,
and have six months of food.

23:11.467 --> 23:14.067
I got my final load,
the head, in here.

23:14.067 --> 23:15.800
I'm ready to head for camp.

23:15.833 --> 23:17.700
About a mile and a quarter
and I'll be home.

23:21.433 --> 23:23.300
This morning when I came
out for the first load,

23:23.333 --> 23:25.233
it was glassy calm water.

23:25.267 --> 23:26.867
Now the wind's coming up.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.733
The waves are getting bigger.

23:28.767 --> 23:30.067
Sometimes they can get so big

23:30.067 --> 23:31.933
that it isn't safe
to be out here.

23:31.967 --> 23:35.067
I've been caught out on a lake
in big waves before
in a canoe,

23:35.067 --> 23:37.067
and it's no laughing matter.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.433
This water's so cold

23:38.467 --> 23:40.767
that your survival in it
is just a matter of minutes.

23:43.967 --> 23:45.667
Right now it's okay but

23:47.100 --> 23:48.600
it could get rougher.

23:48.633 --> 23:51.333
So I'm gonna stay
fairly close to shore
on the way home.

24:12.133 --> 24:13.800
Okay, I gotta get this
last piece of meat,

24:13.833 --> 24:15.267
the neck, up onto the rack.

24:15.300 --> 24:17.367
That's the heaviest
piece of meat,
the way I cut it.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.667
So, I'm not gonna be able
to carry it up there.

24:31.633 --> 24:33.267
I can't wait to eat
that moose nose.

24:33.300 --> 24:35.400
I like moose nose.

24:35.433 --> 24:37.600
Just thinking about it
makes me hungry.

24:40.633 --> 24:43.333
I got all of the meat
on the platform now.

24:43.367 --> 24:45.533
And now it's
onto the next step.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.500
I gotta still
protect this meat.

24:47.533 --> 24:49.833
Tomorrow, I'm gonna try
and get all this meat hung up

24:49.867 --> 24:51.267
where the bears
can't get to it.

24:54.067 --> 24:56.900
SUE: Everything here is just
a huge amount of money.

24:56.933 --> 24:58.767
It's a... It's a huge risk.

24:58.800 --> 25:00.433
And I enjoy it,

25:00.467 --> 25:01.600
but you bet your bottom dollar

25:01.633 --> 25:03.167
I'm gonna be out here
protecting it.

25:18.500 --> 25:20.367
I've got several bears
in the area.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.867
I've got a lot
of people in camp,

25:21.900 --> 25:23.133
a lot of meat in camp,

25:23.167 --> 25:24.733
which is gonna draw attention.

25:24.767 --> 25:27.467
People ask me and
I usually say
it kind of funny, you know.

25:27.500 --> 25:29.500
"What do bears
like to eat up here?"

25:29.533 --> 25:33.767
"You know, berries and
slow tourists, and we're
fresh out of berries."

25:33.800 --> 25:37.333
NARRATOR: With two days
remaining until
bear hunting season opens,

25:37.367 --> 25:38.967
Sue must take
every step she can

25:39.067 --> 25:41.267
to prevent bears
from attacking camp.

25:42.767 --> 25:45.700
SUE: You now, what's...
What are my avenues
for protecting camp?

25:45.733 --> 25:47.533
Walk the perimeter.
Are there prints?

25:47.567 --> 25:49.267
What is it?
What kind? How close?

25:49.300 --> 25:50.433
Is it a mom with cubs?

25:50.467 --> 25:52.433
I've got to do
all those visuals.

25:52.467 --> 25:53.867
Get the bleach.

25:53.900 --> 25:56.500
Typically what I do
this time of year,

25:56.533 --> 25:59.867
lightly the rest of the year,
this time of year definitely,

25:59.900 --> 26:03.533
I get bleach
and I sprinkle it around camp.

26:03.567 --> 26:05.733
Bears can smell
from ten miles away.

26:05.767 --> 26:07.667
Very strong, acrid scents

26:07.700 --> 26:09.900
will burn their noses

26:09.933 --> 26:12.200
and deter them somewhat.

26:12.233 --> 26:14.233
This right here,
this is my storage closet,

26:14.267 --> 26:16.167
but this time of year
it's the meat shed.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.100
People hang it,
put tarps down.

26:18.133 --> 26:20.400
I try to keep it
as clean as possible.

26:27.567 --> 26:30.067
All the meat and everything
is still here.

26:32.133 --> 26:37.067
You can see over here,
bear, bear, bear, bear.

26:37.067 --> 26:38.633
This is not the first time

26:38.667 --> 26:41.133
that the bears
have taken out parts
of the building.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.133
I keep repairing it.

26:43.167 --> 26:45.800
You know, you've got
brand new claw marks.

26:46.967 --> 26:50.200
So, time for me
to get the bleach.

26:50.233 --> 26:51.733
You spray down
the whole building.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.533
You know, you do what you can.

26:57.500 --> 26:59.100
Try to protect the camp.

26:59.133 --> 27:02.167
This is just
your basic bleach,
you know.

27:03.067 --> 27:04.500
And you just...

27:08.333 --> 27:12.533
You know, you're just
gonna wanna
get the grounds.

27:12.567 --> 27:15.667
You're not trying to
perform miracles and scrub it.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.133
Whenever you have meat,

27:17.167 --> 27:20.567
somebody's gotten blood,
you do it.

27:20.600 --> 27:24.133
It's still my privilege
to make people's visits

27:24.167 --> 27:26.500
as great as they can be.

27:26.533 --> 27:30.167
But it's my burden
to keep them as safe as I can.

27:33.233 --> 27:35.733
I don't see anything
fresh that worries me

27:35.767 --> 27:37.667
but I can't take chances.

27:37.700 --> 27:40.467
You must be proactive.
You can't leave it to chance.

27:40.500 --> 27:43.067
A sucker, a pork chop
leaves it to chance.

27:43.067 --> 27:44.600
You wanna be a pork chop?
Go right ahead.

27:44.633 --> 27:47.067
You know,
I'll serve the applesauce.

27:47.067 --> 27:48.333
ANDY: That's what
life is out here.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.567
You're always adapting
to new situations

27:50.600 --> 27:53.067
and you don't just blindly
go out and do things.

27:53.067 --> 27:54.433
You gotta think about
what you're doing

27:54.467 --> 27:56.433
and have a
plan A and a plan B.

28:11.067 --> 28:14.100
It's starting to warm up
a little today.

28:14.133 --> 28:16.933
Finally. Our wind died down.

28:16.967 --> 28:19.600
I'm just gonna cut these whole
so we can get them
done quicker.

28:22.233 --> 28:25.533
NARRATOR: With minor repairs
being made
to their fish wheel,

28:25.567 --> 28:27.367
Andy and Kate
must work quickly

28:27.400 --> 28:30.067
to keep up with the demand
of their daily haul.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.900
Okay baby. I'm ready.

28:34.933 --> 28:36.800
We work pretty good
as a team doing this.

28:38.067 --> 28:41.167
My job is basically
to collect the fish,

28:41.200 --> 28:43.133
cut the fish,
and hang the fish.

28:43.167 --> 28:46.300
Kate's job is to help
getting fish from the boat
to the cutting table.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.333
It's a huge help having
a second person there

28:48.367 --> 28:51.233
to just transfer fish
from the table.

28:51.267 --> 28:53.567
Once I start cutting,
I can cut really fast,

28:53.600 --> 28:55.367
but if I have to
take breaks to get fish

28:55.400 --> 28:57.067
from the boat to the table,

28:57.067 --> 28:58.733
it really slows me down.

29:04.333 --> 29:07.567
I'm gonna have to check
the wheel again.
No downtime.

29:07.600 --> 29:10.800
Dawn to dusk,
that's what fishing is around
here this time of year.

29:12.233 --> 29:13.500
Pretty critical
to fish this wheel

29:13.533 --> 29:16.200
as much as
I possibly can right now.

29:16.233 --> 29:18.500
Hopefully a quick trip over.

29:18.533 --> 29:20.967
I'm hoping I have a good
300 fish in the wheel,

29:21.067 --> 29:22.367
maybe 400.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.833
Holy shit!
What the hell
is going on there?

29:24.867 --> 29:26.500
That don't look good.

29:26.533 --> 29:28.967
It looks like the boxes
are both full,

29:29.067 --> 29:32.133
but my flotation
isn't the same on both sides.

29:33.167 --> 29:36.933
I've got a problem here.
This doesn't look good.

29:36.967 --> 29:41.133
I've got a couple of holes or
a hole in at least one barrel
on the outside pontoon.

29:41.167 --> 29:43.067
I'm almost underwater here.

29:49.100 --> 29:50.800
NARRATOR: After
a minor repair,

29:50.833 --> 29:54.400
Andy faces yet another
breakdown of the fish wheel.

29:54.433 --> 29:56.867
One of the barrels
is taking on water,

29:56.900 --> 29:58.333
and if not repaired,

29:58.367 --> 30:01.000
the wheel could sink
into the Yukon River.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.367
So one of the problems
that I got right now

30:06.400 --> 30:08.500
with that barrel leaking
is that

30:08.533 --> 30:10.867
it's hitting my
lead right there.

30:10.900 --> 30:12.900
It's tipping the wheel down.

30:12.933 --> 30:15.800
That basket is
kicking out at an angle

30:15.833 --> 30:17.500
and as it comes down,

30:17.533 --> 30:19.900
it's hitting
the side of that lead.

30:19.933 --> 30:22.067
And if that basket
hooks on this lead,

30:22.100 --> 30:25.733
it could start ripping
the whole fish wheel apart.

30:25.767 --> 30:28.067
So the only thing I think
I'm gonna be able to do is

30:28.100 --> 30:30.567
if I can, try and lighten
this wheel up

30:30.600 --> 30:33.200
and see if
I can't get a barrel
underneath of it.

30:33.233 --> 30:36.500
I've never done that before
out in the middle
of the river,

30:36.533 --> 30:39.067
and I definitely know
I'm not gonna be
able to do this alone.

30:39.100 --> 30:42.200
So, I'm gonna have to
go back and get Kate.

30:42.233 --> 30:43.600
But the first thing
I've got to do is

30:43.633 --> 30:46.867
I gotta get all this
heavy fish off that pontoon.

30:46.900 --> 30:49.000
I gotta get this wheel
emptied out

30:49.033 --> 30:52.800
so that the lead's
not being hit
by the baskets

30:52.833 --> 30:54.733
and stabilise the situation

30:54.767 --> 30:58.033
so that nothing gets
ripped apart on me right now.

31:01.267 --> 31:02.533
It would be disastrous for me

31:02.567 --> 31:04.533
to have to
pull this wheel out right now

31:04.567 --> 31:06.567
right in the
middle of the run,
the peak of the run.

31:06.600 --> 31:08.767
The best I can do
is get in there,

31:08.800 --> 31:11.467
fix things as best as I can
out in the river,

31:11.500 --> 31:12.967
keep it fishing, and

31:13.067 --> 31:15.067
hopefully, I can make it
through the season here.

31:18.367 --> 31:20.100
CHIP: It's a
dog-eat-dog world.

31:20.133 --> 31:21.700
Big fish eat little fish.

31:21.733 --> 31:23.833
Nobody apologises
or prayers for them.

31:23.867 --> 31:26.967
If you're in nature,
you're probably
gonna get eaten alive.

31:27.067 --> 31:29.500
It's good to be a human,
we're the top predator.

31:38.667 --> 31:41.800
CHIP: It's cows and calves.
There's more coming though.

31:41.833 --> 31:43.300
Yeah, there's one decent bull.

31:43.333 --> 31:45.267
Yeah,
there's lots behind them.

31:46.733 --> 31:47.733
(SIGHS)

31:48.300 --> 31:49.633
They hit the water.

31:51.533 --> 31:53.933
NARRATOR: The entire
Hailstone family stocks up

31:53.967 --> 31:55.400
for the dark winter ahead.

31:56.267 --> 31:57.767
This is their last day

31:57.800 --> 32:01.067
before the caribou
can no longer be hunted
for the fall season.

32:02.467 --> 32:05.067
-Sorry about that.
-One bull, Ting.

32:10.467 --> 32:11.733
Get closer!

32:11.767 --> 32:14.367
AGNES: We just want
that one big one
right in front of you!

32:15.867 --> 32:18.067
Carol, get it,
watch what
you're doing, Ting!

32:18.067 --> 32:19.667
Wait until he separates
from those two!

32:19.700 --> 32:22.100
-Ting, get it! Ting, get it!
-Give it a shot.
Give it a shot.

32:25.167 --> 32:26.567
-There you go.
-Yay! (CLAPPING)

32:28.367 --> 32:29.433
Grab a hold.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.567
Here, Ting.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.567
Straight to me,
straight to me.

32:34.600 --> 32:37.067
Qutan made a shot and
Tingmaq put a second one in it

32:37.067 --> 32:38.733
for what we call a sure-shot.

32:38.767 --> 32:41.067
There's nothing wrong
with what we call
a double-tap up here.

32:41.067 --> 32:42.967
And all it...
All we're doing
is making sure

32:43.067 --> 32:46.067
that the animal
is dead as quickly and
as efficiently as possible.

32:47.167 --> 32:49.200
KIDS: Oh, bonfire! (LAUGHTER)

32:49.667 --> 32:50.767
That's lots!

32:50.800 --> 32:52.533
-MARY: Scary.
-TING: Don't be scared.

32:54.167 --> 32:57.067
-And you, you're like...
-There we go.

32:57.067 --> 32:58.200
(LAUGHTER)

32:59.533 --> 33:00.900
Oh!

33:00.933 --> 33:03.200
CHIP: Well, we teach our kids
this lifestyle as best we can.

33:03.233 --> 33:06.933
And my kids, I think,
are pretty well
getting at understanding it.

33:06.967 --> 33:08.567
As long as my kids
keep looking forward

33:08.600 --> 33:11.500
and they keep profiting
from what's going on,

33:11.533 --> 33:12.933
it could be
in learning something,

33:12.967 --> 33:14.533
it could be in making money.

33:14.567 --> 33:16.500
It doesn't matter,
they just gotta keep
moving forward.

33:16.533 --> 33:19.067
And I think
my wife teaches that
to these kids pretty well.

33:19.067 --> 33:22.367
And, um, I think the kids
have learned from me that,

33:22.400 --> 33:26.133
you know,
you gotta just be
loyal to your lifestyle.

33:26.167 --> 33:28.133
I also try to let them enjoy
everything they're doing,

33:28.167 --> 33:30.267
because I try to enjoy my day
and enjoy my life

33:30.300 --> 33:31.833
and enjoy the work
that I have to do.

33:31.867 --> 33:33.567
And as long as
I can get that across
to the kids,

33:33.600 --> 33:35.133
I think they'll keep
working too,

33:35.167 --> 33:36.700
with a positive attitude
and a smile.

33:39.067 --> 33:40.467
GLENN: I don't
know the future,

33:40.500 --> 33:42.233
I don't know how long
I'll live at this location

33:42.267 --> 33:43.933
here in the Brooks range.

33:43.967 --> 33:46.133
But I know that even
if I ever leave here,

33:46.167 --> 33:48.467
the place has left
an indelible impression on me.

33:48.500 --> 33:51.267
It's one of the
most special places

33:51.300 --> 33:53.267
that I have ever been to
in the world.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.400
(DOOR CREAKS SHUT)

34:06.233 --> 34:09.233
This is the first snow
of the year
down here at lake level.

34:09.267 --> 34:11.533
It's getting colder,
and winter is
just around the corner.

34:11.567 --> 34:13.467
I'm gonna hang
that meat up today.

34:13.500 --> 34:16.100
It's not really safe until
I get it up high enough that
the bears can't get to it.

34:21.133 --> 34:24.600
This is a meat-pole
that I built the first fall
I was out here

34:24.633 --> 34:27.867
when I killed my first
moose ten years ago.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.800
It's about 20 feet
above the ground

34:29.833 --> 34:31.267
right here on this end.

34:32.067 --> 34:33.467
It's tried and tested,

34:33.500 --> 34:35.733
bears cannot get to meat
on this meat pole.

34:44.067 --> 34:45.867
I'm gonna have to
go out on that pole

34:45.900 --> 34:47.833
and attach ropes
to hang the meat from.

34:47.867 --> 34:49.433
And I'm gonna hoist the meat.

34:49.467 --> 34:51.267
And I can also use
that line for safety

34:51.300 --> 34:52.600
when I'm crossing the pole.

35:05.967 --> 35:07.400
Working alone I have
to be very careful

35:07.433 --> 35:09.433
because there's
nobody to help me.

35:09.467 --> 35:12.067
Every time I get up here
by myself I always think,

35:12.067 --> 35:13.967
what the hell would I do

35:14.067 --> 35:16.800
if I knocked that ladder down

35:16.833 --> 35:18.200
trying to get back onto it

35:18.233 --> 35:20.500
and I was stuck up here
with no ladder.

35:20.533 --> 35:21.600
If I fell down,

35:22.600 --> 35:25.200
broke my back,
it'd be a slow, painful death

35:25.233 --> 35:26.767
laying there on the ground
freezing to death.

35:29.733 --> 35:31.600
This meat is much too heavy

35:31.633 --> 35:34.067
for me to just pull it up,
even with a rope.

35:34.100 --> 35:35.800
When I put
my pulleys up there,

35:37.233 --> 35:39.300
I'll be able to
position them here

35:39.333 --> 35:41.433
by pulling on this cord
that I've rigged.

35:45.133 --> 35:47.467
Put the cord through there.

35:52.100 --> 35:53.500
Let's see what happens.

35:56.833 --> 35:58.800
I can get it up there
good and high.

35:59.433 --> 36:00.700
Now,

36:00.733 --> 36:02.467
no bear's gonna
get a hold of that.

36:18.067 --> 36:19.233
Whoa!

36:20.567 --> 36:21.700
(EXCLAIMS)

36:23.700 --> 36:25.367
Start all over.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.067
It's not good
that the ribs fell

36:27.067 --> 36:29.367
'cause they
could have gotten dirty
if they landed on the ground.

36:29.400 --> 36:31.567
But it's better those ribs
fell from up there than me.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.167
It's about 20 feet high.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.667
I got to start all over again.

36:35.733 --> 36:37.167
The way I attached it

36:37.200 --> 36:39.233
when I was
trying to lift it up

36:39.267 --> 36:40.900
and take that other cord off,

36:40.933 --> 36:42.233
the pin slipped out

36:42.267 --> 36:45.067
and without tension on it,
it wouldn't hold it.

36:46.067 --> 36:47.600
It fell out,
the meat fell down.

37:07.367 --> 37:10.400
One piece down,
several more to go.

37:10.433 --> 37:13.567
Once I get this meat upwards,
safe from bears,

37:13.600 --> 37:16.300
it's safe
for the rest of the winter.

37:16.333 --> 37:17.467
I'll be able to
keep this meat,

37:17.500 --> 37:18.933
because it's gonna
get cold enough here.

37:18.967 --> 37:21.300
It's gonna be frozen
in a short time

37:21.333 --> 37:23.267
and the meat
will last me until spring.

37:26.700 --> 37:28.600
All right.

37:28.633 --> 37:30.500
I'm gonna try and get
the head up there.

37:30.533 --> 37:32.067
The last load.

37:33.533 --> 37:37.067
The weather
got a little breezy
and cooler this afternoon,

37:37.067 --> 37:39.733
couldn't be better
than this for the meat.

37:43.567 --> 37:47.433
I'll be able to
leave this meat up here
until next spring.

37:56.533 --> 38:01.300
I've got six month's food here
in just one week's labour.

38:01.333 --> 38:03.067
It was well worth the effort.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.833
ANDY: We live out here
to live a certain lifestyle,

38:08.867 --> 38:10.067
to be connected to the land,

38:10.100 --> 38:11.633
to get the resources
from the land,

38:11.667 --> 38:13.300
and a lot of people
don't understand

38:13.333 --> 38:15.133
how important that is to us.

38:33.233 --> 38:34.433
All right. (SIGHS)

38:37.300 --> 38:40.533
So this is the replacement
barrel, I take it?

38:40.567 --> 38:42.367
Well, I don't think there's
any replacement.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.567
I think
this is an addition. (LAUGHS)

38:47.167 --> 38:48.500
NARRATOR: In order to
keep the fish wheel

38:48.533 --> 38:51.433
from sinking
into the Yukon River,

38:51.467 --> 38:55.133
Andy must modify a barrel
to help the wheel stay afloat.

39:01.267 --> 39:03.067
I'm gonna weld
some tabs on it,

39:03.100 --> 39:05.367
'cause, uh, there's no way
to hold onto this

39:05.400 --> 39:06.633
when it's in the current.

39:13.333 --> 39:15.367
Tighten up these bolts here.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.567
I think we're ready
to go across the river

39:19.067 --> 39:20.267
and flounder about.

39:23.067 --> 39:25.333
Once we get out there,
I'll start figuring out

39:25.367 --> 39:27.333
what's gonna work
and what's not
gonna work.

39:27.367 --> 39:28.833
I mean, that's kind
of the way I do things.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.500
I just get a plan A, try it.

39:30.533 --> 39:34.067
If it doesn't work,
hopefully, an obvious plan B
comes into play

39:34.067 --> 39:37.700
and you just modify
what you're doing
and try and make it work.

39:41.700 --> 39:43.233
What I'm thinking is,

39:44.067 --> 39:46.067
if we get a line on it here,

39:46.067 --> 39:47.933
get a line on it there,

39:47.967 --> 39:50.867
and then attach a line here,

39:50.900 --> 39:52.233
we can stick it down.

39:55.267 --> 39:57.867
We tend to catch
a lot more fish at night.

39:57.900 --> 40:00.400
So I wanna get
this thing fixed

40:00.433 --> 40:03.133
so that,
at least, I'm fishing
through the night tonight.

40:04.733 --> 40:07.200
Yeah, that's what we need.

40:08.967 --> 40:10.167
Come to papa.

40:14.467 --> 40:15.533
(GRUNTING)

40:17.767 --> 40:20.400
Ooh, yeah,
I think we almost got it.
Hold that right there.

40:21.333 --> 40:23.033
We just gotta keep it
from flipping out.

40:23.067 --> 40:25.833
Somehow, I gotta get something
around the barrel here

40:25.867 --> 40:28.133
to keep it
from wanting to
roll out that way.

40:28.167 --> 40:31.000
There's a red tie-down,
long tie-down strap.

40:31.033 --> 40:32.533
Maybe I can get
that around it.

40:38.700 --> 40:40.167
Brr! That water's cold.

40:44.433 --> 40:45.567
(SHUDDERING)

40:45.600 --> 40:48.733
Man, I don't think
I'd wanna go swimming in that.

40:48.767 --> 40:51.500
So I'm hoping I can
just secure this really well

40:51.533 --> 40:54.467
so that it can't pivot
or... Or move at all.

40:56.033 --> 40:57.400
I think we got it.

40:57.433 --> 41:00.700
Hopefully we can just
get going on our fishing

41:00.733 --> 41:03.867
and not have to mess with
fixing the old girl any more.

41:03.900 --> 41:06.067
You the man, Andy!
You the man!

41:06.067 --> 41:08.567
That was luck.
That feels pretty secure.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.467
So I think
I'll get this thing
spinning again.

41:11.500 --> 41:15.067
And hopefully,
we'll come in tomorrow

41:15.067 --> 41:17.400
with some really,
really full boxes.

41:17.433 --> 41:18.467
That'd be good.

41:29.833 --> 41:32.267
SUE: I live just a few miles
from the Arctic Ocean.

41:32.300 --> 41:33.833
I've been here for 12 years.

41:33.867 --> 41:35.167
For nine,
ten months of the year,

41:35.200 --> 41:36.800
I'm 100% alone out here.

41:38.700 --> 41:40.567
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't love it.

41:54.667 --> 41:55.733
Hey, buddy.

41:57.533 --> 41:58.633
MAN: Looking good.

41:58.667 --> 41:59.900
So did you see anything?

42:00.067 --> 42:01.267
-Nothing.
-Okay.

42:01.300 --> 42:03.200
I see you though,
you look good.

42:03.233 --> 42:05.100
-God bless you.
-(LAUGHS) Thanks.

42:05.133 --> 42:08.667
NARRATOR: With less than
24 hours before
bear hunting season opens,

42:08.700 --> 42:12.800
Sue must continue
watching over the safety
of her remaining guests.

42:16.067 --> 42:18.400
You know, it's an
uncomfortable feeling.

42:20.733 --> 42:22.433
I mean, I'm used to it.

42:22.467 --> 42:25.633
I have the bears
getting really close.

42:25.667 --> 42:28.467
This feels very much
like it did the other year

42:28.500 --> 42:31.167
when I had the altercation
with the bear.

42:31.200 --> 42:33.100
You know,
I called it an alpha push.

42:42.900 --> 42:46.133
So, I mean, this is kinda your
pointed line of demarcation.

42:46.167 --> 42:49.133
You know,
take your little paw,
run it down.

42:49.167 --> 42:51.300
Here is my runway and camp,

42:51.333 --> 42:54.200
here is the wilderness
and the bear's playground.

42:55.167 --> 42:56.267
He crosses this line,

42:56.300 --> 42:57.800
I can use deadly force

42:57.833 --> 43:01.500
and by God I'll do it
if that means keeping
my people and camp safe.

43:01.533 --> 43:04.067
I got people to keep safe,
and a camp to guard,

43:04.100 --> 43:05.567
and that's what I'm gonna do.
