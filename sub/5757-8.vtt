WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:05.339
I SPOKE TO HANNA'S MOM
AND SHE SAID THAT SHE
COULD LOOK AFTER YOU.

00:05.373 --> 00:06.774
LOOK AT CARD.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.319
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
BUT IT'S ABOUT MIKE.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.321
HOW WAS THE DINNER PARTY?
IT WAS FINE...

00:20.354 --> 00:22.223
TILL THE COPS SHOWED UP
TO LET US KNOW THAT OUR SON

00:22.256 --> 00:24.125
HAD BEEN ARRESTED
FOR BREAKING AND ENTERING.

00:24.158 --> 00:27.561
I SEE YOU DOING SKETCHY STUFF
AND I WORRY ABOUT YOU.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.630
YOU ALREADY KNOW MORE ABOUT ME
THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.499
SO WHY CAN'T WE JUST KEEP IT
WHERE IT IS?

00:31.532 --> 00:33.667
A HOCKEY STICK?
PART OF ONE.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.737
AND IT WAS BURIED?
I THOUGHT IT WAS SOME OLD JUNK
TILL YOUR DAD SAW IT.

00:36.770 --> 00:40.174
YOU CAN'T BURN THAT.
I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT
WITH JUNK I FIND ON MY PROPERTY.

00:40.208 --> 00:43.144
PLEASE.
STOP IT!

00:43.177 --> 00:46.280
LOOK, FROM NOW ON,
I NEED TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO BE HAPPY,

00:46.314 --> 00:47.748
AND I'D LIKE TO DO THAT HERE.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.683
SO WHO'S JASON?
ALI'S BROTHER.

00:49.717 --> 00:52.586
NO, I KNOW THAT,
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW HE
WAS FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.256
THINGS ARE A LITTLE
TENSE RIGHT NOW
BETWEEN ME AND ISABEL.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.558
NO, YOU'RE STAYING HERE
BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE
WITH MOM.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.561
WE'VE TURNED A CORNER.
STOP USING ME AS AN EXCUSE.

01:00.594 --> 01:04.565
YOU TOOK THINGS FROM EMILY.
YOU BROKE INTO SPENCER'S HOUSE.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.167
YOU STOLE FROM A BLIND GIRL.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.202
I GOT THAT FROM
GARRETT REYNOLDS' APARTMENT.

01:08.236 --> 01:12.206
DO THE POLICE KNOW
WHAT KIND OF WEAPON
THE KILLER USED ON ALISON?

01:12.240 --> 01:14.242
THAT WOULD ALL BE
IN THE CORONER'S REPORT.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.876
SO IT WOULD SAY
WHAT SHE WAS HIT WITH?

01:15.909 --> 01:17.711
ALI'S KILLER IS DEAD.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.623
Hanna:
IT WAS JUST THE TWO OF YOU,
SITTING IN GARRETT'S CAR?

01:29.657 --> 01:31.459
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO MEET HIM.

01:31.492 --> 01:34.295
IT WASN'T LIKE I COULD ASK HIM
THAT STUFF DOWN AT THE PRECINCT.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.664
HOW DID YOU GET AWAY FROM HIM?

01:36.697 --> 01:40.268
WHEN YOU SENT ME THAT TEXT,
I TOLD HIM IT WAS FROM MY MOM.
SHE WANTED ME HOME ASAP.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.270
AM I STILL SHAKING?
I'M STILL SHAKING.

01:42.303 --> 01:44.672
YEAH, WE'RE ALL SHAKING.
CAN YOU TURN ON THE HEAT?

01:44.705 --> 01:47.241
YOU COULD MAKE
A SLUSHY BACK HERE.

01:47.275 --> 01:50.244
GUYS, WHY WOULD JENNA
GIVE HIM THAT LANTERN?

01:50.278 --> 01:52.446
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
SHE GAVE IT TO HIM.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.348
WHAT DO YOU THINK, HE BOUGHT IT
AT THE BLIND ARTISTS'
CRAFTS FAIR?

01:54.382 --> 01:56.284
OF COURSE SHE GAVE IT TO HIM.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.552
THE QUESTION IS,
WHEN DID THEY BECOME BUDDIES?
AND WHY?

01:58.586 --> 02:00.321
SPENCER, THEY GREW UP ACROSS
THE STREET FROM EACH OTHER.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.889
HIS PARENTS
STILL LIVE IN THAT HOUSE.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.824
MAYBE HE'S JUST BRINGING
RAW MEAT TO JENNA'S CAT.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.294
TOBY LIVES THERE, TOO,
AND THEY DON'T HAVE A CAT.

02:06.327 --> 02:09.363
THEN MAYBE HE WAS BRINGING OVER
RAW MEAT FOR JENNA.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.798
HERE COMES EM.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.737
WHO'S LIVING
IN HER HOUSE NOW?

02:16.770 --> 02:18.739
SOME LOSERS WHO CAN'T
FIGURE OUT THE ALARM SYSTEM.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.374
THEY'VE TRIPPED IT
LIKE THREE TIMES.

02:20.408 --> 02:24.378
THE SECURITY COMPANY
KEEPS CALLING HER MOM IN TEXAS.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.680
EVERYTHING OKAY?
YEAH, IT'S FINE.

02:26.714 --> 02:29.650
IT'S JUST SO WEIRD
TO WALK IN THERE AND SEE
OTHER PEOPLE'S STUFF.

02:29.683 --> 02:32.486
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU TELL 'EM
TO LAY OFF THE ALARM
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS?

02:32.520 --> 02:35.489
I'M GUESSING
THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE.
WELL, THEY WILL NOW.

02:35.523 --> 02:39.627
I'M SURE ARIA'S PARENTS
ARE GONNA HAVE MIKE
ON LOCKDOWN TILL HE TURNS 18.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.395
YOU DID NOT JUST SAY THAT,
HANNA.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.431
WHAT? I'M NOT JUDGING.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.499
I'M JUST GUESSING THAT
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER

02:45.533 --> 02:48.436
WILL FIND ANOTHER HOBBY BESIDES
BREAKING AND ENTERING.

02:48.469 --> 02:51.439
STILL TALKING.

02:51.472 --> 02:54.308
GUYS, LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH MY BROTHER.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.510
IF I KNEW,
YOU WOULD KNOW.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.346
EMILY?

03:00.781 --> 03:02.550
ISN'T THAT GARRETT'S CAR?

03:03.751 --> 03:04.885
I THINK IT IS.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.321
WHERE'S HE GOING?

03:08.589 --> 03:10.324
TO HIS PARENTS', I GUESS.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.236
OH, MY GOD.
HE'S GOING INTO JENNA'S HOUSE.

03:22.270 --> 03:25.239
IS TOBY HOME?
NO, HE WENT TO GO GET
HIS PARENTS FROM THE AIRPORT,

03:25.273 --> 03:26.840
AND I THOUGHT HE SAID
JENNA WENT WITH HIM.

03:26.874 --> 03:27.975
HE'S GOING INSIDE.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.877
HE JUST WALKED IN.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.690
CAN YOU WALK ANY SOFTER?

03:42.723 --> 03:45.526
PLEASE, JENNA CAN'T HEAR US.
SHE'S BLIND.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.262
YOU...
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.546
( all gasp )

04:13.821 --> 04:15.456
( all gasp )

04:25.032 --> 04:27.335
( all gasp )

04:31.739 --> 04:34.508
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT? *

04:34.542 --> 04:36.910
* SWEAR THIS ONE YOU'LL SAVE

04:36.944 --> 04:38.946
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

04:38.979 --> 04:41.549
* TAKING THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

04:41.582 --> 04:43.717
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

04:43.751 --> 04:46.920
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

04:46.954 --> 04:49.089
* 'CAUSE TWO
 CAN KEEP A SECRET *

04:49.122 --> 04:51.492
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD

04:56.364 --> 04:58.098
JEEZ, GIVE IT A REST, EM.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.401
I NEED TO WORK ON MY CORE.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.436
NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU WERE DOING SIT-UPS
IN YOUR SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

05:02.470 --> 05:05.473
I DIDN'T SLEEP.
YEAH, ME NEITHER.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.741
BUT WHY BOTHER
WHEN YOU CAN HAVE A NIGHTMARE

05:07.775 --> 05:10.010
JUST BY PARKING IN FRONT
OF THE CAVANAUGH HOUSE?

05:10.043 --> 05:11.912
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S GARRETT.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.748
THAT'S WHO JENNA WAS BUYING
THAT LINGERIE FOR.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.817
I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT.
IT'S TOO EARLY.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.387
HERE, HYDRATE.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.622
OH, NOT THAT MUCH.
I HAVE TO WATCH MY SUGAR INTAKE.

05:21.655 --> 05:26.794
WATCH MINE, 'CAUSE I'M ABOUT
TO HAVE A BIG-ASS BOWL
OF COCOA PUFFS.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.762
ARE YOU ALWAYS LIKE THIS
BEFORE A MEET?

05:28.796 --> 05:31.965
IT'S NOT JUST A MEET.
THE SCOUT FROM DANBY'S COMING.

05:31.999 --> 05:35.936
THIS COULD BE MY LAST CHANCE
TO TURN THIS LIE AROUND
BEFORE IT GETS WORSE.

05:35.969 --> 05:39.640
EM, YOU ONLY LIED
TO YOUR PARENTS.
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.042
LOOK, I'M JUST SAYING,
THEY'RE IN TEXAS NOW.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.144
MAYBE THE MORE TIME
THAT GOES BY--

05:44.177 --> 05:47.748
THEY'LL FORGET?
IT'S ANOTHER ZIP CODE, HANNA,
NOT A PARALLEL UNIVERSE.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.718
( groans )
CAN YOU PASS ME MY BAG?

06:00.694 --> 06:03.163
EM, DIDN'T YOU
GET THAT YESTERDAY?

06:03.196 --> 06:04.932
YOU'VE USED A LOT.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.033
IT WORKS.

06:08.636 --> 06:09.737
GOOD MORNING.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.972
OH, HI.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.874
IS THERE ENOUGH COFFEE
FOR, UH...

06:13.907 --> 06:17.144
WELL, I WOULD'VE MADE MORE
IF I KNEW THAT YOU...

06:17.177 --> 06:20.614
THE DECISION TO STAY OVER
WAS SPUR OF THE MOMENT.

06:20.648 --> 06:23.984
YOUR MOM AND I STRETCHED
HAPPY HOUR INTO A WHOLE NIGHT,
AND SHE DIDN'T WANT ME TO DRIVE.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.986
YEAH, DAD,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.755
YOU USED TO LIVE HERE,
REMEMBER?

06:27.788 --> 06:29.122
( sighs )

06:30.991 --> 06:33.126
MORNING. COME JOIN THE PARTY.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.966
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO BE ANYWHERE UNTIL 10:00.
YOU WERE GONNA SLEEP IN.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.769
YEAH, WELL,
INTERNAL ALARM CLOCK.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.737
SOME THINGS
YOU JUST CAN'T TURN OFF.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.644
WHAT'S THIS?

06:50.678 --> 06:53.146
YESTERDAY'S MAIL.
IT WAS ON THE MAT
WHEN I CAME HOME LAST NIGHT.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.215
THANKS, EMILY.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.650
THIS IS YOURS.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.454
FANCY.
WHO LIVES IN BALTIMORE?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.526
MY DAD.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.797
I DON'T REMEMBER SENDING THAT.

07:09.830 --> 07:12.032
YOU DIDN'T.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.602
IT'S FROM ISABEL.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.748
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED
IN SIX WEEKS.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.751
SAVE THE DATE.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.036
( knock at door )

07:56.243 --> 07:57.578
HELLO, SPENCER.

07:57.611 --> 07:58.912
HI.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.881
UH, MAY I COME IN?

08:00.914 --> 08:02.249
YEAH, SURE.

08:05.586 --> 08:06.954
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

08:06.987 --> 08:09.690
I WAS HOPING TO SEE MELISSA.
IS SHE HERE?

08:09.723 --> 08:11.959
NO, SHE'S BACK IN PHILADELPHIA.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.695
SHE HASN'T REALLY BEEN
BACK MUCH SINCE THE FUNERAL.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.697
YEAH, I WAS HOPING TO ATTEND,
BUT I HADN'T SEEN YOUR PARENTS

08:16.730 --> 08:18.699
SINCE THEY ASKED ME
TO DISAPPEAR.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.902
SO I FIGURED MY PRESENCE
MIGHT BE MORE INCITING
THAN COMFORTING.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.037
SO YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY
TO DROP OFF A PLANT?

08:24.071 --> 08:26.206
WASN'T ACTUALLY OUT OF MY WAY.

08:26.239 --> 08:29.109
I JUST STARTED A ROTATION
AT ROSEWOOD COMMUNITY.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.145
YOU'RE BACK HERE?
FOR SIX MONTHS.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.847
I APPLIED THERE
AS MY NUMBER ONE CHOICE

08:34.881 --> 08:36.049
WHEN I WAS ENGAGED
TO YOUR SISTER.

08:36.082 --> 08:38.118
IT JUST CAME THROUGH.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.220
SOMEBODY UP THERE HAS
A DIVINE SENSE OF IRONY.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.855
( chuckles )

08:41.889 --> 08:43.123
ARE THE PARENTS HOME?

08:43.155 --> 08:45.225
THEY'RE NOT.

08:45.258 --> 08:49.730
UM, HAVE YOU
EVER DONE AN AUTOPSY?

08:49.763 --> 08:53.100
SORRY?
IT'S JUST THIS PROJECT
THAT I HAVE TO DO FOR SCHOOL.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.636
I NEED TO KNOW IF A DOCTOR
CAN LOOK AT A HEAD WOUND

08:55.669 --> 08:58.806
AND KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
THE WEAPON WAS THAT CAUSED IT.

08:58.839 --> 09:01.274
WHO DOES THE AUTOPSIES
DOWN AT ROSEWOOD COMMUNITY?

09:01.308 --> 09:02.876
THE HOSPITAL'S PATHOLOGIST.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.779
WHERE WOULD HE
KEEP HIS RECORDS?

09:05.813 --> 09:07.781
IN THE MORGUE--
WHERE I MIGHT NAP TODAY
IF I DON'T GET A COFFEE.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.617
DO YOU MIND I HAVE ONE?
I'M KNACKERED.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.685
I'M SORRY, I REALLY NEED
TO GET TO SCHOOL.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.053
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
LET ME TAKE YOU.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.788
WE COULD STOP
FOR SOMETHING ON THE WAY.

09:14.822 --> 09:18.358
YOU DIDN'T COME ALL THIS WAY
TO SEE MELISSA, DID YOU?

09:18.391 --> 09:21.128
WHY DON'T WE CONTINUE THIS
OVER COFFEE?

09:21.161 --> 09:24.632
WREN. I HAVE A BOYFRIEND NOW.

09:24.665 --> 09:25.966
FINE. HOW ABOUT TEA?

09:28.301 --> 09:31.605
SO WHAT DOES YOUR MOM WANT?
I MEAN, IF YOUR DAD
DITCHES ISABEL, WOULD SHE--

09:31.639 --> 09:34.274
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
THEY. THEM.
THEY'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.877
WHAT TIME IS YOUR MEET?
THREE-THIRTY.
BUT I'M PRACTICING DURING LUNCH.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.613
AND IF I CAN GET OUT
OF SIXTH PERIOD EARLY--
EM, EASY.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.915
YOU'RE ALREADY WEARING
MORE PAIN CREAM THAN CLOTHES.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.617
JUST SAVE SOME MOJO
FOR THE RACE.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.253
WHAT'S WRONG?

09:49.857 --> 09:51.659
WHO'S HE WITH?

09:51.692 --> 09:54.662
ANOTHER SATISFIED CUSTOMER,
I GUESS.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.730
WHY DON'T YOU GO INSIDE.
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER.

09:56.764 --> 09:57.765
OKAY.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.224
CALEB?

10:24.257 --> 10:29.262
HEY, SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
BUT YOU MIGHT NOT WANNA BE
DOING THIS ON THE STREET.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.765
HEY, RYAN.
RYAN, WAIT UP.
NO, LET HIM GO.

10:31.799 --> 10:34.201
YOU CANNOT BE DOING BUSINESS--
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT, HANNA?

10:34.234 --> 10:36.103
NO MORE LECTURES
ON GOING LEGIT.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.206
I'M NOT TRADING UP FOR
A PAPER HAT AT BENNY'S BURGERS.

10:39.239 --> 10:42.042
THIS IS HOW I MAKE MY MONEY.
GET OVER IT.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.356
HEY THERE.

10:56.389 --> 10:59.727
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

10:59.760 --> 11:03.430
IT'S MY TURN TO TEACH
THE DRIVER'S ED CLASS.

11:03.463 --> 11:06.767
I'M HOPING I CAN SCARE KIDS
INTO WATCHING THE ROAD INSTEAD
OF THEIR CELL PHONES.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.168
FUNNY, RIGHT?

11:08.201 --> 11:10.170
YEAH, THAT'S ACTUALLY
REALLY FUNNY.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.172
I HAVE TO GO TO CLASS.

11:12.205 --> 11:15.308
SPENCER, WE NEVER FINISHED
OUR CONVERSATION LAST NIGHT.
YOU RAN OFF.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.111
I JUST HAVE A LOT OF DRAMA
GOING ON AT MY HOUSE.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.213
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
IT'S FINE.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.315
YOU HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS
AND SOME STRONG IDEAS

11:22.349 --> 11:25.018
ABOUT WEAPONS
AND HEAD WOUNDS--

11:25.052 --> 11:27.921
I KNOW. I CAN GET LIKE THAT.
I'M REALLY SORRY
IF I BOTHERED YOU.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.790
YOU SEEMED PRETTY DISTRAUGHT.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.191
NO. NO, NOT REALLY.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.361
IT WAS JUST SOMETHING
THAT I READ IN BIOLOGY

11:34.394 --> 11:36.363
GOT ME THINKING ABOUT
ALI'S AUTOPSY,

11:36.396 --> 11:38.766
BUT LIKE YOU SAID,
THE CASE IS CLOSED.

11:38.799 --> 11:42.836
SO THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
I REALLY HAVE TO GO TO CLASS.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.049
WHAT'S UP, MIKE?

11:56.083 --> 11:57.317
HEY.

11:57.350 --> 12:00.020
SO IS IT TRUE?
WHAT?

12:00.053 --> 12:02.389
IS SMASH-AND-GRAB
YOUR NEW SPORT?

12:02.422 --> 12:05.125
WHAT'S THE DEAL, MAN?

12:05.158 --> 12:07.394
WHAT, ARE YOU TRYING ON
NEW PERSONALITIES OR SOMETHING?

12:07.427 --> 12:09.963
THIS WEEK
YOU'RE GONNA BE GANGSTER,
AND NEXT WEEK YOU'RE CRACKHEAD?

12:09.997 --> 12:11.398
BITE ME.
MIKE--

12:11.431 --> 12:12.465
BACK OFF!
HEY!

12:14.467 --> 12:17.204
DON'T YOU GUYS
HAVE A CLASS TO GET TO?

12:20.273 --> 12:23.176
CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
FOR A MOMENT?

12:23.210 --> 12:24.744
LATER.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.795
HEY. I SAW YOU
RACE BY MY BUILDING.

12:41.829 --> 12:45.065
I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE YOU
WERE COMING TO CAMPUS TODAY.

12:45.098 --> 12:49.236
OH, I HAD TO. IF I DON'T
FINISH THIS THING, IT DOESN'T
GET FIRED TILL NEXT FRIDAY.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.505
HMM. AND HERE I WAS HOPING
YOU'D BE AT THE POTTER'S WHEEL

12:52.539 --> 12:57.845
SO I COULD WRAP MY ARMS
 AROUND YOU AND HUM
 UNCHAINED MELODY.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.981
( chuckles )
I'VE SEEN THAT MOVIE.
IT ENDS SADLY.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.950
WELL, WE COULD GIVE IT
A HAPPY ENDING.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.088
CAN WE DO THIS LATER?

13:08.121 --> 13:09.522
YEAH.

13:09.556 --> 13:13.827
UH, HOW'RE THINGS AT HOME?

13:13.861 --> 13:15.262
SUCKY.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.865
LOOK, KIDS DO STUPID THINGS.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.267
PROBABLY ONE OF MIKE'S FRIENDS
PUT HIM UP TO IT.

13:20.300 --> 13:24.271
HE'S BROKEN
INTO OTHER HOUSES, TOO.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.975
JASON CAUGHT HIM
BREAKING INTO HIS HOUSE
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

13:28.008 --> 13:31.912
JASON? AS IN ALI'S-BROTHER-
WHO-SAT-NEXT-TO-ME-

13:31.945 --> 13:34.848
AT-THE-DINNER-THAT-
NEVER-HAPPENED-JASON?

13:34.882 --> 13:37.985
IS THAT WHAT YOU TWO
WERE TALKING ABOUT
THE OTHER NIGHT?

13:38.018 --> 13:40.320
YEAH.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.260
IS THIS YOURS, TOO?
IT'S AMAZING.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.362
JENNA MADE THAT.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.331
WOW. SHE'S TALENTED.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.007
SO HOW'RE THINGS SHAPING UP
BETWEEN YOU GUYS?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.009
SHE DROPPED THE CLASS.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.277
YEAH, BUT BEFORE SHE LEFT,
DID YOU GUYS FIND A WAY...

14:04.311 --> 14:07.014
NO. SHE LEFT
BEFORE I HAD THE CHANCE.

14:09.049 --> 14:13.186
ARIA, WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME WHAT WAS GOING ON?
WITH YOUR BROTHER.

14:13.220 --> 14:17.190
I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.194
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

14:21.228 --> 14:25.098
I GET IT. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE EMBARRASSED WITH ME.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.234
ABOUT ANYTHING.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.903
MAYBE YOU COULD STOP BY
MY PLACE LATER...

14:29.937 --> 14:31.504
SURE.

14:33.406 --> 14:34.908
I WILL CALL YOU.

14:37.945 --> 14:38.979
BYE.

14:42.415 --> 14:47.320
SO SHOULD I BE WORRIED ABOUT
YOU AND THIS JASON GUY?

14:47.354 --> 14:51.624
WHAT? NO. NO.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.050
DAD?

15:18.485 --> 15:20.287
HOW? WHAT?

15:20.320 --> 15:23.056
I WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU
AFTER THE MEET.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.724
IS MOM WITH YOU?

15:24.757 --> 15:26.393
NO, SHE'S STILL IN TEXAS.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.495
I HAD TO BE IN DELAWARE
FOR A TRAINING SEMINAR

15:28.528 --> 15:31.264
AND THEY CANCELLED
ALL THE FLIGHTS BACK.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.100
SOME HUGE STORM DOWN THERE.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.668
SO I FIGURED I COULD EITHER
SIT IN THE AIRPORT IN BETHESDA

15:35.702 --> 15:39.339
OR IN THE STANDS IN ROSEWOOD.

15:39.372 --> 15:42.575
YOU DROVE ALL THE WAY UP HERE?
WELL, YOUR MOM SAID
IT WAS AN IMPORTANT MEET.

15:42.609 --> 15:46.379
SHE SAID THAT YOU TOLD HER
THAT THE SCOUT FROM
DANBY COLLEGE IS COMING.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.647
I DID?

15:47.680 --> 15:50.083
OH, RIGHT, I DID, YEAH.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.352
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING HIM.
WHAT'S HIS NAME AGAIN? RABIN?

15:54.621 --> 15:56.489
DAD, I WISH I'D KNOWN.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.158
DON'T WORRY, ALL RIGHT?

15:58.191 --> 16:01.061
I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR
WHOLE PRE-RACE ROUTINE,

16:01.094 --> 16:04.197
SO I'M NOT GONNA
HOLD YOU UP. GO.

16:04.231 --> 16:09.202
BUT IF YOU HEAR SOMEBODY
SCREAMING IN THE STANDS
LIKE A CRAZY PERSON, THAT'S ME.

16:10.337 --> 16:11.371
GO GET 'EM.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.244
( sighs )

16:21.348 --> 16:24.117
( groaning )

16:26.319 --> 16:29.589
( screaming )

16:31.491 --> 16:34.294
EMILY?

16:34.327 --> 16:36.563
EMILY!

16:36.596 --> 16:38.565
OW! OW!

16:38.598 --> 16:43.303
L31 REQUESTING
A RESCUE AMBULANCE UNIT
AT ROSEWOOD HIGH SCHOOL!

16:43.336 --> 16:44.537
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

16:44.571 --> 16:48.641
OH, GOD! OH!

16:52.779 --> 16:55.482
HOW CAN I HAVE AN ULCER?
I THOUGHT I JUST
PULLED A MUSCLE.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.484
THEY'RE CAUSED BY STRESS, HON.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.619
ALL RIGHT, AND LET'S FACE IT--

16:59.652 --> 17:03.323
YOU LEAVING HOME,
YOUR MA MOVING,

17:03.356 --> 17:05.392
WELL, YOU'VE HAD
YOUR FAIR SHARE.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.660
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?
WHEN CAN I SWIM AGAIN?

17:07.694 --> 17:11.098
THAT'S OFF THE TABLE
AT THE MOMENT.

17:11.131 --> 17:15.167
EM, EMMY, LISTEN TO ME.
LISTEN TO ME.

17:15.202 --> 17:19.806
IF YOU'RE STRESSING
ABOUT THE DANBY SCHOLARSHIP,
I WANT YOU TO LET IT GO, OKAY?

17:19.839 --> 17:22.709
THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO WITHDRAW THE OFFER
BECAUSE YOU HAD A SETBACK.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.211
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

17:24.243 --> 17:27.180
I KNOW THAT YOU NEED TO REST.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.715
YOU NEED TO LISTEN
TO THE DOCTOR.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.317
I NEED TO SWIM.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.719
HEY, YOU WILL, BABE.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.487
YOU WILL...
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.725
DO YOU WANT ME
TO TALK TO THIS SCOUT?

17:38.758 --> 17:40.327
DO YOU HAVE THE NUMBER--

17:40.360 --> 17:42.862
NO, DON'T CALL HIM.
I'LL DO IT.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.298
I DON'T MIND.
OR GET YOUR MA TO DO IT.

17:45.332 --> 17:49.536
NO, I DON'T WANNA SAY ANYTHING
TILL I KNOW WHEN I CAN
SWIM AGAIN, OKAY?

17:49.569 --> 17:53.273
OKAY. OKAY.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.108
( sighs )

17:55.142 --> 17:57.477
AREN'T ULCERS
SOMETHING OLD PEOPLE GET?

17:57.510 --> 17:59.646
GET THAT LOOK OFF YOUR FACE.
YOU'RE GONNA FREAK HER OUT.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.249
HER? WHAT ABOUT ME?
I'M HAVING DEJA VU.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.251
I SPENT A WEEK IN THIS PLACE.

18:04.284 --> 18:07.754
IF I SEE ANOTHER BOWL
OF GREEN JELLO, I'M GONNA
PUKE ON YOUR SHOES.

18:07.787 --> 18:10.257
OH, GOD.
I'M GONNA WALK BEHIND YOU.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.458
( phone rings )

18:11.491 --> 18:13.660
IS THAT ARIA?

18:13.693 --> 18:16.296
CALEB.
I'LL JUST CALL HIM BACK LATER.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.497
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:17.530 --> 18:18.765
( elevator dings )

18:26.273 --> 18:29.309
HAN, ARE YOU AND CALEB...

18:29.342 --> 18:32.179
WE'RE FINE.
THERE'S JUST STUFF GOING ON.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.580
LIKE WHAT?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.315
LIKE AN UNDERCOVER COP

18:35.348 --> 18:37.217
IN A CAR FOLLOWING HIM.

18:37.250 --> 18:40.453
WHY?
( sighs)
I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.855
YOU HAVE TO.
YOU'RE IN AN ELEVATOR.
WHERE ELSE ARE YOU GONNA GO?

18:42.889 --> 18:44.457
DOES HE KNOW ABOUT THE COP?

18:44.491 --> 18:46.426
NO. I HAVEN'T TOLD HIM.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.894
WHY NOT?

18:47.927 --> 18:49.796
BECAUSE I'M STILL
THINKING THINGS THROUGH.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.564
WHAT IS THERE
TO THINK THROUGH?

18:51.598 --> 18:53.533
IF I TELL HIM,
HE MIGHT RUN, OKAY?

18:55.702 --> 18:57.670
I'M NOT READY
TO LOSE HIM AGAIN.

18:57.704 --> 19:01.374
YEAH, AND IF THE COPS
ARE REALLY AFTER HIM,

19:01.408 --> 19:03.210
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE HIM ANYWAY.

19:18.391 --> 19:21.594
HEY. DID YOU JUST GET HOME?

19:21.628 --> 19:24.397
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA COME BY THE HOTEL
SO WE COULD GRAB SOME DINNER.

19:24.431 --> 19:27.900
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE.
HANNA CAME BY THE BANK
TO BORROW MY CAR.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.436
EMILY IS IN THE HOSPITAL.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.538
WHAT? WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?

19:31.571 --> 19:33.673
SHE COLLAPSED AT SCHOOL.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.842
I JUST GOT AN UPDATE--
IT'S AN ULCER.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.345
SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY.
HER DAD'S THERE.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.812
WOW. POOR KID.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.782
DO YOU WANT ME
TO RUN YOU DOWN THERE?

19:42.815 --> 19:47.554
OR WE COULD STAY IN,
GET SOME FOOD.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.422
TOM...

19:50.623 --> 19:54.661
YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.564
I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE ANOTHER MEAL
LIKE BREAKFAST THIS MORNING.

19:57.597 --> 20:03.436
THIS...
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

20:05.538 --> 20:09.709
BUT I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE LET YOU STAY LAST NIGHT.

20:09.742 --> 20:12.745
IT'S CONFUSING TO HANNA,
TO YOU, TO ME.

20:12.779 --> 20:16.816
IT'S NOT FAIR TO ANYBODY.

20:18.351 --> 20:21.254
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED,
AS THE MAILMAN

20:21.288 --> 20:23.790
SO PROMPTLY REMINDED US
THIS MORNING.

20:23.823 --> 20:28.428
ASHLEY--
TOM, I NEED TO BE WITH A MAN
WHO'S SURE OF WHAT HE WANTS.

20:30.497 --> 20:31.698
THAT WAS NEVER YOU.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.930
SO ALL THOSE MUSCLE SPASMS
AND THE PAIN--

21:03.963 --> 21:05.698
THAT'S ALL
COMING FROM YOUR STOMACH?

21:05.732 --> 21:09.068
YEAH, BUT ULCERS CAN HEAL.
IT'S NOT FOREVER, EM.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.504
YEAH, BUT SHE'S GOT A HOLE--

21:11.538 --> 21:15.742
YES, THERE'S A HOLE
IN HER STOMACH. MOVING ON.
WHERE'D YOUR DAD GO?

21:15.775 --> 21:20.480
HE WENT TO THE HOUSE
TO TALK TO THE NEW TENANTS.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.616
GUYS, I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS.
I CAN'T KEEP LYING TO HIM.

21:23.650 --> 21:27.920
I GUESS NOT, NOT IF IT'S
EATING HOLES IN YOUR STOMACH.
MOVING ON!

21:27.954 --> 21:30.690
HEY, I'M SORRY.
I GOT HERE AS SOON AS I COULD.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.492
I HAD TO ESCAPE
FAMILY COURT IN MY LIVING ROOM.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.694
MIKE ON TRIAL?

21:34.727 --> 21:37.063
YEAH, BUT THE DEFENDANT
DIDN'T EVEN SHOW UP.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.365
I GOT YOUR FAV.

21:40.467 --> 21:43.102
OH, SHE CAN'T DRINK COFFEE.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.838
YEAH, SHE'S GOT
A HOLE IN HER STOMACH.

21:45.872 --> 21:48.040
I'LL TRADE IT IN
FOR AN HERBAL TEA,

21:48.074 --> 21:50.877
UNLESS YOU WANT US ALL HERE
WHEN YOUR DAD GETS BACK.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.112
SHE'S NOT TELLING HER DAD.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.415
IF HE FINDS OUT
THAT THE LETTER IS FAKE,
HE'S GONNA MOVE HER TO TEXAS.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.584
IF SHE DOESN'T TELL HIM,
SHE'S NOT GONNA GET ANY BETTER.

21:57.617 --> 22:00.920
BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE UP
HER MIND RIGHT THIS SECOND,
OKAY?

22:00.953 --> 22:04.023
SHE ALREADY HAS.

22:04.056 --> 22:06.426
I'M TELLING HIM THE TRUTH.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.955
IT'S THE THIRD FLOOR.

22:35.988 --> 22:38.090
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR FRIEND
EMILY, RIGHT?

22:38.124 --> 22:40.693
YEAH. HOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT SHE WAS HERE?

22:40.727 --> 22:42.529
I SAW HER NAME
ON THE ADMITTANCE CHART.

22:42.562 --> 22:45.465
THEY RUSHED HER INTO THE E.R.,
BUT SHE'S STABILIZED.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.743
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
GOING FOR A RIDE.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.645
( chuckles )

22:58.678 --> 23:01.648
SO HOW IS SHE?
HAVE YOU SEEN EMILY?

23:01.681 --> 23:03.182
I HAVEN'T,
BUT SHE'S IN GOOD HANDS.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.117
I'LL BE POPPING IN
SOON ENOUGH ON ROUNDS.

23:13.993 --> 23:16.729
SPENCER,
YOU WANT THE THIRD FLOOR.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.601
WHAT IS DOWN THERE?

23:21.634 --> 23:25.805
KITCHEN, LAUNDRY, RADIOLOGY,
PATHOLOGY, THE MORGUE.

23:25.838 --> 23:28.007
EMILY HAS
A MUCH BETTER VIEW.

23:38.150 --> 23:41.120
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THEY KNOW?

23:41.153 --> 23:45.758
LAST NIGHT, SPENCER WAS
HAMMERING ME WITH QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE MURDER WEAPON.

23:45.792 --> 23:49.996
WHETHER THE CORONER
COULD TELL IF IT WAS USED
BY A MAN OR A WOMAN.

23:50.029 --> 23:51.998
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
NOTHING.

23:52.031 --> 23:56.135
DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO SAY ANYTHING.
SHE CUT ME OFF AND RAN HOME.

23:56.168 --> 23:59.238
BUT THEN WHEN I SAW HER AGAIN
THIS MORNING, SUDDENLY IT WAS
OFF HER RADAR.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.174
SHE'S PLAYING YOU.
I DON'T THINK SO.

24:02.208 --> 24:05.545
DO THEY KNOW ABOUT JASON?
I'M NOT SURE.

24:05.578 --> 24:08.180
BUT THEY'RE
DEFINITELY QUESTIONING
WHETHER IAN KILLED HER.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.018
WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THIS.

24:19.225 --> 24:20.493
( knock at door )

24:20.527 --> 24:22.161
EMILY?

24:22.194 --> 24:23.763
OH, HI.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.765
I THOUGHT SPENCER
WAS UP HERE.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.267
SHE JUST WENT DOWN
TO THE CAFETERIA
TO GET SOME SOUP.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.503
WHAT, OUR FOOD? WILLINGLY?

24:31.904 --> 24:34.173
HOW'RE YOU FEELING?

24:34.206 --> 24:37.209
HUNGRY. WEAK. SCARED.

24:39.178 --> 24:41.981
ARE YOU MY DOCTOR NOW?
NO. JUST CHECKING IN.

24:42.014 --> 24:43.616
SO THE GOOD NEWS IS,
THE MEDS ARE WORKING

24:43.650 --> 24:45.718
AND YOUR STOMACH'S
ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY.

24:45.752 --> 24:48.988
ALTHOUGH I PROBABLY WOULDN'T
CELEBRATE THIS WEEKEND
WITH A TAKE-OUT CURRY.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.190
IS THERE BAD NEWS?

24:53.125 --> 24:55.995
THERE IS BAD NEWS.

24:56.028 --> 24:59.265
LOOK, EMILY, I KNOW
YOU SWIM COMPETITIVELY.

24:59.298 --> 25:02.602
AND I KNOW THE PRESSURE
EVERY ATHLETE'S UNDER
TO PERFORM AT THEIR BEST,

25:02.635 --> 25:04.303
TO CONSTANTLY BREAK
THEIR OWN RECORDS.

25:04.336 --> 25:07.173
WAIT, I THOUGHT SWIMMING
DIDN'T CAUSE THE ULCER.

25:07.206 --> 25:11.678
IT DIDN'T, BUT YOUR PANELS
CAME BACK WITH HIGH LEVELS
OF HGH IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM.

25:11.711 --> 25:14.180
HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE?
I'VE NEVER TAKEN THAT.

25:14.213 --> 25:16.182
EMILY, IF YOU'RE USING
A PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUG
OR ANY KIND OF STEROID,

25:16.215 --> 25:18.685
IT'S GOING TO SHOW UP
IN YOUR TESTS.

25:18.718 --> 25:21.020
AND YOU NEED TO KNOW THE PERILS
OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING!

25:21.053 --> 25:23.322
THIS IS INSANE!
YOUR TEST IS WRONG!

25:23.355 --> 25:26.025
EMILY, THESE TESTS DON'T LIE.
AND I DID CHECK TWICE.

25:26.058 --> 25:28.194
I'M HERE AS A FRIEND.

25:28.227 --> 25:30.863
I ASKED YOUR ATTENDING
IF I COULD SPEAK TO YOU FIRST.

25:30.897 --> 25:33.099
HAVE YOU TOLD MY DAD
ABOUT THIS?

25:33.132 --> 25:35.802
I HAVEN'T. BUT YOU'RE A MINOR
SO HE WILL HAVE TO KNOW.

25:35.835 --> 25:38.304
NO, YOU CAN'T. PLEASE.
DON'T TELL HIM THIS.

25:38.337 --> 25:41.908
I COULD GET KICKED OFF
THE TEAM, IT'D RUIN
ANY CHANCE OF A SCHOLARSHIP.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.943
SLOW DOWN.
PLEASE.

25:43.976 --> 25:47.580
I'LL TAKE THE TEST AGAIN.
JUST DON'T TELL MY PARENTS.

25:50.182 --> 25:53.720
I'LL SPEAK TO YOUR ATTENDING.
SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

25:53.753 --> 25:54.854
( sighs )

26:00.092 --> 26:01.160
( sighs )

26:22.649 --> 26:24.283
CALEB, GET IN!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:24.316 --> 26:25.752
JUST HURRY UP! GET IN!

26:27.419 --> 26:29.055
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO CATCH A MOVIE.
CLOSE THE DOOR!

26:29.088 --> 26:31.190
OR WE CAN JUST BE IN ONE.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.359
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED LIKE THAT?

26:50.977 --> 26:53.312
PSST. HEY, IN HERE.

26:53.345 --> 26:54.947
SPENCER, WHAT THE HELL?

26:54.981 --> 26:56.883
SHH. TALK LATER.
YOU NEED TO CHANGE.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.719
WHY ARE YOU WEARING--
COME ON!

27:13.800 --> 27:15.001
( knock at door )

27:22.775 --> 27:26.178
I HOPE THAT'S HOMEWORK
YOU'RE DOING.
IT IS.

27:26.212 --> 27:31.884
SO YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED AT SCHOOL TODAY

27:31.918 --> 27:33.886
WITH YOUR FRIEND CHAZ?

27:33.920 --> 27:35.688
HE'S NOT MY FRIEND.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.089
REALLY? SINCE WHEN?

27:37.123 --> 27:39.325
SINCE I DON'T WANNA
TALK ABOUT IT.

27:39.358 --> 27:42.294
OKAY, HOW ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT
WHY YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP
THIS AFTERNOON.

27:42.328 --> 27:45.097
IGNORING THIS
WILL NOT MAKE IT GO AWAY.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.833
AND THE PIRELLIS MAY NOT BE
PRESSING CHARGES,

27:46.866 --> 27:48.400
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK WITH US.

27:48.434 --> 27:52.038
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHY YOU WOULD
BREAK IN TO THEIR HOUSE.

27:52.071 --> 27:55.842
WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?
WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING FOR?

27:55.875 --> 27:57.777
I WASN'T LOOKING FOR ANYTHING.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.812
WELL, THEN YOU WENT THROUGH
AN AWFUL LOT OF TROUBLE

27:59.846 --> 28:02.782
TO GET YOURSELF IN TROUBLE.

28:02.815 --> 28:05.718
MIKE, WHAT IS GOING ON?

28:05.752 --> 28:08.755
I SAID
I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT!
AND I SAID WE HAVE TO!

28:08.788 --> 28:11.290
SO ONCE AGAIN
WE'RE BACK ON YOUR SCHEDULE?

28:14.160 --> 28:16.729
SHOULD I HURRY UP AND TALK FAST
BEFORE YOU MOVE OUT AGAIN?

28:35.481 --> 28:37.449
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

28:37.483 --> 28:40.853
IT BELONGS TO SPENCER'S FAMILY.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.154
I'M GUESSING SO DOES
MOST OF PENNSYLVANIA.

28:42.188 --> 28:44.256
DO THEY KNOW WE'RE HERE?

28:44.290 --> 28:45.892
NOPE.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.794
SO WE'RE BREAKING IN.

28:47.827 --> 28:50.129
WE'RE BORROWING IT.
IS THIS KINDLING?

28:50.162 --> 28:54.433
MM, NOT UNLESS WE
WANNA BURN THE COUCH.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.405
CAN I HELP?

29:08.080 --> 29:10.883
SO ARE YOU GONNA LOSE THE SCARF
AND SHADES AT SOME POINT,

29:10.917 --> 29:12.384
OR DID YOU BRING
A COSTUME FOR ME, TOO?

29:12.418 --> 29:14.353
CALEB, THERE'S SOMEONE
FOLLOWING YOU.

29:14.386 --> 29:17.890
WHAT?

29:17.924 --> 29:20.827
I THINK IT'S A COP.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.528
HE DRIVES A DARK GREY CAMARO.

29:22.561 --> 29:25.965
AND I'VE SEEN HIM
AROUND TOWN A LOT LATELY.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.901
HE'S DEFINITELY
WATCHING YOU.

29:28.935 --> 29:30.837
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED HIM?

29:30.870 --> 29:33.372
NO.

29:33.405 --> 29:36.108
BUT THEN AGAIN, I GUESS
I KINDA STOPPED LOOKING.

29:36.142 --> 29:38.477
HAVE YOU BEEN FOLLOWED BEFORE?

29:42.581 --> 29:46.185
DOES THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH THE STUFF YOU DID
IN ALLENTOWN?

29:46.218 --> 29:47.353
MAYBE.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.859
LOOK, I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU
WAY MORE THAN YOU NEED TO KNOW.

29:52.892 --> 29:54.593
WHAT DOES HE WANT?

29:54.626 --> 29:57.329
I MEAN, IF HE
WANTS TO ARREST YOU,
WHAT'S HE WAITING FOR?

29:57.363 --> 30:00.199
WHAT DOES HE THINK YOU DID?
I DON'T KNOW.

30:00.232 --> 30:01.834
BUT IF HE HAS
A QUESTION TO ASK ME,

30:01.868 --> 30:03.936
HE NEEDS TO COME UP
AND ASK ME.

30:03.970 --> 30:06.205
I'M NOT HIDING.
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE.

30:06.238 --> 30:09.075
YOUR BUSINESS ISN'T EXACTLY
IN THE YELLOW PAGES.

30:09.108 --> 30:11.143
THIS IS WHY
YOU BROUGHT ME HERE?

30:11.177 --> 30:13.579
I THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE SAFER HERE.

30:13.612 --> 30:15.915
I DON'T WANNA HIDE.

30:15.948 --> 30:19.551
HANNA, I'LL DEAL WITH THIS.

30:19.585 --> 30:22.889
BY LEAVING TOWN AGAIN?

30:22.922 --> 30:26.292
THIS TIME? NO, I WON'T.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.128
YOU SAY THAT NOW,
BUT YOU WILL.

30:33.199 --> 30:34.333
HANNA...

30:41.908 --> 30:43.943
I AM NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

30:46.145 --> 30:47.947
BUT IF YOU DO,
CAN I COME WITH YOU?

30:47.980 --> 30:49.315
I'LL PACK REALLY FAST.

30:49.348 --> 30:52.384
SERIOUSLY, YOU KNOW
THAT I'M GOOD AT CAMPING.

31:25.952 --> 31:29.155
OH, UH, CAN YOU LEAVE THAT?
I HAVEN'T EATEN YET.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.256
SURE.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.061
THANK YOU.

32:08.327 --> 32:12.698
YOUR PAIN CREAM? "A" IS IN
OUR MEDICINE CABINET, TOO?
THIS HAS TO BE A NEW RECORD.

32:12.731 --> 32:14.566
HOW LONG HAS THIS
BEEN IN YOUR SYSTEM?

32:14.600 --> 32:16.168
DID IT DAMAGE ANY ORGANS?

32:16.202 --> 32:18.237
FORGET MY ORGANS!
IT'S ON MY MEDICAL CHART!

32:18.270 --> 32:20.506
IT'S RUINED MY LIFE!
I CAN NEVER SWIM AGAIN!

32:20.539 --> 32:22.541
EMILY, MEDICAL RECORDS
ARE PRIVATE.

32:22.574 --> 32:24.510
NOT FROM YOUR PARENTS!

32:24.543 --> 32:26.478
WHAT'RE YOU GONNA
TELL YOUR DAD?

32:26.512 --> 32:28.347
I'M GONNA TELL HIM
TO GET ME OUT OF HERE.

32:28.380 --> 32:31.383
TAKE ME TO TEXAS. I'M DONE.
IT CAN'T GET WORSE THAN THIS.

32:31.417 --> 32:34.186
EMILY, REMEMBER,
"A" TRIED TO PLOW DOWN
HANNA WITH A CAR.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.355
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

32:36.388 --> 32:39.525
I'M JUST SAYING THAT "A"
TRIED TO TAKE ONE OF US DOWN
AND IT DIDN'T WORK.

32:39.558 --> 32:42.361
SPENCER, "A" IS TAKING US DOWN.
ONE AT A TIME.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.196
ARIA'S PROBABLY NEXT.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.198
CAN WE ALL GO TO TEXAS?

32:46.232 --> 32:49.435
NO! STOP IT!
WE'RE NOT GIVING IN
TO THIS FREAK!

32:49.468 --> 32:52.338
LOOK, WE ARE THIS CLOSE
TO FINDING OUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO ALISON.

32:52.371 --> 32:54.606
AND IF "A" IS THE ONE
THAT KILLED HER--
AND IAN.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.309
YEAH, AND THEN "A" IS GONNA BE
THE ONE TO LEAVE ROSEWOOD,
NOT US.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.577
( knock at door )

33:02.248 --> 33:03.749
HI. SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
NO WORRIES.

33:03.782 --> 33:06.618
UH, WE ACTUALLY JUST
HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK.

33:06.652 --> 33:09.521
WHEN DID YOU TWO START
VOLUNTEERING FOR THE HOSPITAL?

33:09.555 --> 33:14.226
TODAY'S ACTUALLY OUR FIRST DAY.
WE'RE STILL ON HOUR ONE.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.594
WE'LL TAKE THIS FOR YOU.

33:15.627 --> 33:16.562
SEE YOU LATER.
BYE.

33:22.101 --> 33:25.137
HOW'S EVERYTHING AT THE HOUSE?
GOOD.

33:25.171 --> 33:30.176
I FOUND THE MANUAL
TO THE ALARM SYSTEM,
CHANGED THE PASSWORD.

33:30.209 --> 33:33.479
BUT I TOLD THEM,
"YOU'RE IN ROSEWOOD,
YOU CAN RELAX."

33:33.512 --> 33:37.015
IT'S MOSTLY FOR SHOW ANYWAY.

33:39.385 --> 33:41.720
YOU FEEL ANY BETTER?

33:41.753 --> 33:44.156
YEAH, A LITTLE.

33:47.293 --> 33:50.762
DAD, UM, I'VE BEEN THINKING--

33:50.796 --> 33:54.833
SO HAVE I.
AND I CALLED MA.

33:54.866 --> 34:01.273
THIS WHOLE SCHOLARSHIP THING--
IT'S NOT WORTH IT, EMMY.

34:01.307 --> 34:06.078
WE DON'T WANT YOU
DRIVING YOURSELF
TO MORE ULCERS OR WORSE.

34:06.112 --> 34:12.118
THE HELL WITH DANBY.
YOU SWIM BECAUSE YOU LOVE TO.

34:12.150 --> 34:15.587
OR DON'T.
DAD--

34:15.621 --> 34:19.491
BABY, WE CAN FIND ANOTHER WAY
TO PAY FOR COLLEGE.

34:19.525 --> 34:23.495
AND I KNOW THAT THERE
ARE DOZENS OF SCHOOLS OUT THERE

34:23.529 --> 34:27.299
THAT WOULD BE
THRILLED TO HAVE YOU,
IN OR OUT OF THE POOL.

34:31.337 --> 34:33.371
WE JUST WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY, BABY.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.315
( crying )

34:49.788 --> 34:50.856
THAT'S IT.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.136
OH, IT'S FREEZING IN HERE.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.537
YEAH, BE THANKFUL FOR THAT.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.610
ARIA, HEY, FOCUS.

35:11.643 --> 35:13.645
I CAN'T DO THIS.

35:13.679 --> 35:17.383
NO, YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING,
OKAY? I AM. JUST WATCH THE DOOR.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.387
WHAT IS THAT? COOKIES?

35:21.420 --> 35:23.255
HOW CAN ANYBODY
EAT COOKIES IN HERE?

35:23.289 --> 35:24.923
THEY STAY FRESH.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.825
OKAY, THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME KIND OF SYSTEM.

35:26.858 --> 35:27.826
HERE, THIS IS IT.

35:29.828 --> 35:32.598
THEY'VE GOT AUTOPSIES IN HERE
DATING BACK TO 2007.

35:34.366 --> 35:40.372
OKAY, D... DEHAVEN,
DELMORE, DILAURENTIS. ALISON.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.243
( sighs )

35:56.622 --> 35:59.225
HI, HONEY. HOW'S EMILY?

35:59.258 --> 36:02.594
SHE'S GOOD.
SHE'S COMING HOME TOMORROW,
I THINK.

36:02.628 --> 36:03.762
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:03.795 --> 36:06.332
CLEANING.

36:06.365 --> 36:08.334
YOU'RE TOSSING EVERYTHING
YOU BOUGHT FOR DAD.
WHERE IS HE?

36:08.367 --> 36:12.338
HE WENT BACK HOME.
HE'S GONNA CALL YOU.

36:12.371 --> 36:14.273
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

36:14.306 --> 36:16.842
IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO GO.

36:16.875 --> 36:20.512
DID YOU GUYS HAVE A FIGHT?
NO.

36:20.546 --> 36:22.748
WELL, THEN WHY
WOULD HE GO BACK TO ISABEL?

36:22.781 --> 36:25.351
BECAUSE HE LOVES HER
AND HE'S GOING TO MARRY HER.

36:25.384 --> 36:29.355
NO, HE DOESN'T.
HE'S BEEN FIGHTING WITH HER.
HE WANTS TO BE WITH YOU.

36:29.388 --> 36:30.922
HANNA--
NO.

36:30.956 --> 36:32.924
I SAW THE TWO OF YOU ACT
LIKE YOU WERE ON A HONEYMOON,

36:32.958 --> 36:36.428
SIPPING WINE ON THE PATIO,
SLOW DANCING, LAUGHING.

36:36.462 --> 36:38.830
I HEARD YOU.
HE SLEPT OVER LAST NIGHT!

36:38.864 --> 36:41.400
YES, HE DID.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.235
AND I REALIZED
THIS MORNING

36:43.269 --> 36:46.538
THAT MY WEEK
OF MAGICAL THINKING IS OVER.

36:46.572 --> 36:48.540
WHY? WHAT DID HE DO WRONG?

36:48.574 --> 36:50.876
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO SAID,
"THINGS CHANGE, PEOPLE GROW."

36:50.909 --> 36:52.311
THEY DO.

36:52.344 --> 36:55.347
I HAVE.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.616
I'M NOT SURE THAT
YOUR FATHER HAS.

36:57.649 --> 37:03.889
I STARTED TO KNOW
WHAT ISABEL MUST'VE FELT LIKE
WHEN HE WAS STILL MARRIED TO ME.

37:03.922 --> 37:05.791
WHO CARES ABOUT ISABEL?

37:05.824 --> 37:08.527
HONEY, I'M NOT GOING
TO LIE TO YOU.

37:08.560 --> 37:12.398
YOUR FATHER AND I WERE BOTH...
INDULGING IN A FANTASY.

37:12.431 --> 37:15.401
BUT THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

37:16.902 --> 37:19.871
HE'S MADE A COMMITMENT
TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

37:19.905 --> 37:22.641
WELL, HE CAN UN-COMMIT!

37:22.674 --> 37:24.276
DO YOU WANNA BE WITH HIM
OR NOT?

37:24.310 --> 37:25.544
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED!

37:27.313 --> 37:29.014
NO, I DON'T.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.851
I'M SORRY. I KNOW THAT'S
NOT WHAT YOU WANNA HEAR.

37:42.027 --> 37:46.498
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS?
"OCCIPITAL FONTANELLE"?

37:46.532 --> 37:48.767
IT'S THIS PART OF YOUR SKULL.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.603
LOOK WHO I'M TALKING TO.
WERE YOU PRE-MED IN PRE-SCHOOL?

37:51.637 --> 37:53.539
THERE'S A LOT IN HERE
THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

37:55.073 --> 37:57.042
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
HERE IS THE SUMMARY PAGE.

37:57.075 --> 38:01.480
"THE IMPACT ON THE POSTERIOR
OF THE VICTIM'S CRANIUM..."

38:01.513 --> 38:04.683
BACK OF HER HEAD.
"INDICATES SHE WAS FACING AWAY
FROM THE ASSAILANT."

38:04.716 --> 38:07.886
THEY GOT HER FROM BEHIND.
SHE WAS AMBUSHED.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.488
OR RUNNING AWAY.

38:09.521 --> 38:10.956
TRYING TO ESCAPE.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.328
"THE CRANIUM WAS DISPLACED
INWARD UPON IMPACT..."

38:16.362 --> 38:17.863
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

38:17.896 --> 38:21.533
IT MEANS SHE WAS HIT SO HARD,
THEY DENTED HER SKULL.

38:23.402 --> 38:29.040
"AND THE WEAPON WAS MOST LIKELY
A CURVED, BLUNT EDGE."

38:29.074 --> 38:30.676
LIKE A FIELD HOCKEY STICK.

38:30.709 --> 38:32.811
YEAH, LIKE THE ONE THAT
ALI BORROWED FROM ME?

38:32.844 --> 38:34.546
THE ONE THAT JASON MOST LIKELY
BURIED IN MY BACKYARD.

38:34.580 --> 38:37.583
JUST KEEP READING.

38:37.616 --> 38:39.551
( gasps )

38:39.585 --> 38:42.654
WHAT? WHAT DOES IT SAY?

38:42.688 --> 38:46.091
THERE WAS DIRT IN HER LUNGS.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.560
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

38:48.594 --> 38:51.497
IT MEANS THAT SHE WAS BREATHING
IN DIRT WHEN SHE DIED.

38:51.530 --> 38:55.501
THAT THE BLOW TO HER HEAD
ISN'T WHAT KILLED HER.

38:55.534 --> 38:56.968
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
ARIA...

38:57.002 --> 39:00.038
ALISON WAS BURIED ALIVE.

39:16.021 --> 39:18.890
HEY! STOP!

39:20.659 --> 39:22.494
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

39:22.528 --> 39:23.862
YEAH, THERE'S A PROBLEM.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.597
YOU STALKING CALEB
IS A PROBLEM.

39:25.631 --> 39:27.098
HE KNOWS WHY
YOU'RE HERE.

39:27.132 --> 39:28.667
REALLY?

39:28.700 --> 39:30.001
YEAH, AND HE'S
NOT GOING BACK.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.870
HE'S FINALLY GOT
HIS LIFE TOGETHER

39:31.903 --> 39:33.605
AND YOU'RE NOT
GONNA PULL IT APART.

39:33.639 --> 39:35.741
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE
OR WHAT YOU WANT,

39:35.774 --> 39:38.544
BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE
IN THIS TOWN WHO LOVE HIM
AND WILL PROTECT HIM.

39:38.577 --> 39:42.047
SO I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
GONNA GET WHAT YOU WANT
BY SPYING ON HIM.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.682
SO GET LOST.

39:54.660 --> 39:55.894
YOU TOOK THIS?

39:55.927 --> 39:57.162
WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT BACK.

39:57.195 --> 40:00.131
JUST LOOK AT THE SUMMARY PAGE.

40:00.165 --> 40:01.733
( phone vibrates )

40:01.767 --> 40:03.469
THAT MUST BE HANNA.

40:03.502 --> 40:05.671
NO, IT'S EZRA.
I WAS SUPPOSED TO CALL HIM.

40:05.704 --> 40:06.972
OH, GO AHEAD.

40:07.005 --> 40:08.540
HE'S DOWNSTAIRS.

40:08.574 --> 40:09.775
I'LL BE BACK.
YEAH.

40:13.512 --> 40:17.949
"DISPLACED CRANIUM"?
"CURVED BLUNT WEAPON"?
THAT'S A HOCKEY STICK, EM.

40:17.983 --> 40:21.953
ARIA DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR THIS,
BUT JASON IS LOOKING WORSE
AND WORSE.

40:30.061 --> 40:32.097
( sighs )

40:35.767 --> 40:37.836
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?

40:37.869 --> 40:41.840
NO. NO, WE'RE JUST HERE
KEEPING HER COMPANY.

40:41.873 --> 40:44.710
SO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING
STRAIGHT HOME FROM HERE?

40:44.743 --> 40:48.914
I MEAN,
IF YOU'RE UP FOR COMPANY,
YOU COULD STOP BY MY PLACE.

40:48.947 --> 40:54.486
( phone rings )

40:56.622 --> 40:58.023
YOU NEED TO GET THAT?

40:58.056 --> 41:02.060
WHAT? NO.
NO, IT'S JUST MY DAD.

41:02.093 --> 41:08.133
AH, I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET HOME AFTER THIS.
THEY'RE PRETTY WORRIED.

41:08.166 --> 41:10.669
OH. OKAY.

41:10.702 --> 41:12.137
ANOTHER NIGHT?

41:12.170 --> 41:14.105
OFF COURSE.
JUST TELL ME WHEN.

41:36.995 --> 41:41.667
I'M TELLING YOU,
HE KNOWS I'M TAILING HIM.

41:41.700 --> 41:45.637
I'M SORRY, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE YOU.

42:02.654 --> 42:05.791
MAYBE YOU SHOULD AT LEAST
CALL YOUR DAD.

42:05.824 --> 42:09.861
WHY?
WE'RE NEVER GONNA BE THAT.

42:27.378 --> 42:28.814
WHERE'S PAGE FIVE?

42:30.115 --> 42:32.083
DID YOU DROP
ONE OF THE PAGES?

42:32.117 --> 42:35.020
NO. WE TOOK
THE WHOLE FILE.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.122
MAYBE IT DROPPED
IN THE ELEVATOR.

42:37.155 --> 42:40.025
NO, NOTHING DROPPED
IN THE ELEVATOR.

42:40.058 --> 42:44.896
LOOK, HERE'S PAGE 1, 2, 3, 4...
PAGE 6.

42:44.930 --> 42:47.132
WHERE THE HELL IS PAGE 5?
