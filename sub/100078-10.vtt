DR. PATCHEFSKY:
I like to call it exactly what it is.

00:06.132 --> 00:07.717
Low ovarian reserve.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.427
I'm the reason we haven't
gotten pregnant.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.845
Look, I just wanna make sure
I'm not the problem.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.888
I don't even know
if I want a baby anymore.

00:12.972 --> 00:14.306
Look, I don't know
what's going on between us,

00:14.390 --> 00:16.308
but maybe it's a good thing
I'm going away.

00:20.479 --> 00:22.481
You told me to get
out of your life.

00:22.565 --> 00:24.900
- We can figure...
- We aren't good for one another.

00:24.984 --> 00:26.610
I'm sorry, Natalie.

00:27.862 --> 00:30.197
MAGGIE: Hey.
- I'm alive.

00:30.281 --> 00:31.907
Yes, sweetheart.

00:31.991 --> 00:34.493
I want you to remarry.

00:34.577 --> 00:37.621
She wants you to remember her
the way she is tonight.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.373
But, Dad, I'm never
gonna see her again.

01:31.217 --> 01:32.510
MAGGIE: Do you want
me to come with you?

01:32.593 --> 01:35.012
Nah, it's just
a blood draw.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.847
So, big day, huh?

01:36.931 --> 01:39.892
- First day of radiation.
- Yeah.

01:39.975 --> 01:42.269
3:00, in the basement.

01:42.353 --> 01:43.938
So, I'll stick
around, then.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.065
- You don't have to.
- Why?

01:46.148 --> 01:47.733
- You don't have to.
- Uh–huh.

01:47.817 --> 01:49.568
- You don't have to.
- Mmm–hmm.

01:56.075 --> 01:57.117
Hey.

02:00.204 --> 02:01.288
Hey.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.543
You going to Lainey's
thing tonight?

02:07.503 --> 02:08.712
I haven't decided yet.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.674
I mean, you were always
closer to her than I was.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.676
You don't have to
tiptoe around me.

02:13.759 --> 02:14.760
I mean, if you want
to go to the party,

02:14.844 --> 02:16.428
you should go
to the party.

02:18.681 --> 02:20.432
Sure, of course.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.102
Look, I'll see
you there.

02:23.185 --> 02:24.436
Okay.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.646
Actually, Will?

02:27.857 --> 02:29.984
I'd like us
to be friends again,

02:30.067 --> 02:32.570
if that's something
you want, too, of course.

02:36.699 --> 02:38.284
- Yeah.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

02:38.367 --> 02:39.785
Yeah, I would.

02:39.869 --> 02:41.161
I really hate
to break this up,

02:41.245 --> 02:43.205
but I got a peds burn
in Treatment Four.

02:43.289 --> 02:45.165
- Got it.
- You, too, Will.

02:45.249 --> 02:48.252
Mom's a little agitated.
Trini thinks she's on something.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.466
I don't seem to have
my insurance card

02:54.550 --> 02:56.218
with me here right now.

02:56.302 --> 02:57.887
I know I'm in the system,
though. You can look it up.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.555
That's okay.
We can deal with it later.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.473
Hi, Ms. Driscoll?
I'm Dr. Manning, and this is Dr...

03:01.557 --> 03:04.143
Dr. Halstead, yes.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.438
I told you I was here before.
He's the one that saw me.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.482
- Of course, I remember.
- Yeah.

03:10.566 --> 03:13.152
So, I understand
Jesse here had an accident.

03:13.235 --> 03:14.320
Yeah, um,

03:14.403 --> 03:17.698
he was nuking some water in the microwave
to make some oatmeal,

03:17.781 --> 03:20.618
and I told him that he shouldn't do that
if I wasn't there with him.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.621
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry, Mommy.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.665
You know, I just turned
around for a second.

03:26.749 --> 03:29.084
- I swear.
- It's okay.

03:29.168 --> 03:31.503
You are very
brave, Jesse.

03:31.587 --> 03:33.297
I can't believe
you're only six.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.924
How about we give
Dr. Manning some...

03:35.007 --> 03:37.426
I'm sorry. Just give her
a little space to examine...

03:37.509 --> 03:39.178
No, I need to be
here with him.

(OBJECTS CLATTERING)

I'll get...

03:41.764 --> 03:44.433
That's okay. No problem.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.435
Thanks.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.437
Your finger's injured.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.521
How'd that happen?

03:49.605 --> 03:53.442
I must have done it
when I was trying to get in my car.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.402
How about we go next door?
I'll take a look at it.

03:55.486 --> 03:57.279
I... I want to be
here with him.

03:57.363 --> 03:58.697
We'll be right in there.

03:58.781 --> 04:00.157
You can keep your eye on him
through the window.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.826
- How's that sound?
- Uh...

04:02.910 --> 04:03.994
Okay.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.082
Okay.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.500
Baby, I'm gonna
be right here.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.421
All right, you're doing
so well, Jesse.

04:16.465 --> 04:17.758
- There you go.
- Yeah.

04:17.841 --> 04:21.428
All right, you can have
a seat on the bed there.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.222
Let's take a look
at that finger.

04:25.349 --> 04:26.934
(WINCES)
- I know.

04:27.977 --> 04:29.478
Yeah,
it's dislocated.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.397
I had to get us
to the hospital.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.857
My keys were
locked in the car

04:33.941 --> 04:36.944
and I thought
I'd smash the window.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.905
I finally realized I have a spare
in the kitchen drawer.

04:43.993 --> 04:46.745
Tell me, Lynne, you under
the influence of drugs right now?

04:46.829 --> 04:48.831
What? No.

04:48.914 --> 04:49.999
No.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.753
There are a number of treatment programs
I can recommend

04:54.837 --> 04:56.046
if you're struggling
with addiction.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.256
"Addiction"?

04:57.339 --> 04:59.341
You didn't really recognize me
in there, did you?

04:59.425 --> 05:02.344
Five milligrams of Oxy,
eight times a day.

05:02.428 --> 05:06.265
You said,
"Should be fine. No problem."

05:06.348 --> 05:08.434
That was four years ago.

05:10.102 --> 05:13.647
You want to point
the finger at someone?

05:13.731 --> 05:15.858
Try looking in the mirror.

05:30.581 --> 05:33.542
3% to 4% superficial
partial thickness

05:33.625 --> 05:35.461

ankle, and foot.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.713
All right, let's prep
to wash and debride.

05:37.796 --> 05:39.089
Is it bad?

05:39.173 --> 05:40.924
It is not as bad
as it looks, all right?

05:41.008 --> 05:44.678
And if we take really good care of it,
it'll be better in no time.

05:44.762 --> 05:48.140
So, when the accident
happened with the microwave,

05:48.223 --> 05:49.558
where was your mommy?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.227
Was she sleeping?

05:52.311 --> 05:56.356
My mom works really hard.
It makes her tired.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.609
I didn't want
to wake her up.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.360
It's all right, Jesse.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.825
Well, you're right. I saw you a little
over four years ago.

06:06.909 --> 06:09.828
You were complaining of post–surgical
complications with your left knee,

06:09.912 --> 06:11.914
and you stated
then your pain level was a nine

06:11.997 --> 06:13.415
on a one–to–10 scale.

06:13.499 --> 06:14.750
I wasn't lying.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.460
No, I'm not
saying you were.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.754
If you didn't believe me,
you shouldn't have written a prescription.

06:18.837 --> 06:21.256
You all were handing
these things out like candy,

06:21.340 --> 06:23.050
and now that you've decided
there's a problem,

06:23.133 --> 06:25.052
I'm left to fend
for myself.

06:25.177 --> 06:28.972
You think I like having to score drugs
out on the street?

06:29.056 --> 06:31.266
It shouldn't
have happened.

06:31.350 --> 06:34.019
Maybe I should have
been more careful.

06:35.729 --> 06:39.233
But I want to help you now,
and I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

06:39.316 --> 06:42.277
I got high this morning

06:42.361 --> 06:44.905
instead of getting
my boy ready for school.

06:44.988 --> 06:48.575
How can anything be more
important to me than him?

06:51.453 --> 06:54.998
I'm...
I'm just so ashamed.

06:58.961 --> 07:00.212
It's all right.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.508
We need to talk.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.009

- Crockett.
- Yeah?

from deployment tomorrow.

you two haven't spoken.

Yeah, well, he's been incommunicado.
It's Navy protocol.

07:24.194 --> 07:28.490

for six weeks.

I don't know
what I'm gonna say.

07:29.700 --> 07:33.078
How about, "Ethan,
so glad to see you"?

07:33.162 --> 07:34.955
I mean, you and I agreed
what happened was a mistake, right?

07:35.038 --> 07:38.792
- Crockett, I kissed you.
- Yeah, for like three seconds.

07:38.876 --> 07:40.169
Because you stopped me.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.129
I don't even know
what would have happened if...

07:42.212 --> 07:43.922
Don't make yourself
crazy over this.

07:44.006 --> 07:46.842

to tell Ethan.

- Dr. Marcel.
- Yeah?

to Baghdad.

- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

of discharging Jesse,

That's against protocol.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.160
If you recommend
in–patient care,

11:00.243 --> 11:01.828
no one's gonna second–guess
your judgment.

11:04.706 --> 11:07.626
I'm sorry, Will, but no.
I can't do that.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.544
That kid is all
she has, Natalie.

11:09.628 --> 11:12.005
I gotta do whatever
I can to keep her from losing him.

11:12.089 --> 11:13.131
Please.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.884
Forty–eight hours.

11:15.967 --> 11:19.554
That is the longest I can
justify keeping him here.

11:19.638 --> 11:20.680
Thank you.

11:20.764 --> 11:23.141
But you're just kicking the can, Will.

11:23.225 --> 11:25.685
There is no way she's gonna be
completely clean by then.

11:41.535 --> 11:42.953
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
(DOOR OPENS)

11:43.036 --> 11:44.204
Dr. Charles?

11:44.287 --> 11:46.540
I'm sorry, you weren't
answering my pages,

11:46.623 --> 11:48.041
and I've got a patient
who needs a consult.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.459
Isn't Dr. Kwon on call?

11:49.543 --> 11:51.461
Yeah, but he's busy
on the floor.

11:51.545 --> 11:54.131
I brought the chart.
Maybe you could review it here.

11:57.175 --> 12:00.095
Um, her EKG and her blood work
came back normal.

12:00.178 --> 12:01.972
No indications
of cardiac syncope.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.932
She's been diagnosed
with panic disorder?

12:04.015 --> 12:05.434
Mmm–hmm.
She was prescribed fluoxetine.

12:05.517 --> 12:06.685
Been on it
for about two weeks.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.103
So she had another
panic attack.

12:08.186 --> 12:11.440
But how do we know if
her regimen is effective?

12:11.523 --> 12:14.317
I guess I thought
that maybe you could speak with her.

12:14.401 --> 12:18.488
Ms. Curry, antidepressants often take
several weeks to kick in, right?

12:18.572 --> 12:22.409
So I would tell Ms. Patel
that you understand her frustration,

12:22.492 --> 12:25.954
to be patient,
and stick with the prescription.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.080
Is there anything else?

12:28.957 --> 12:32.544
Yes. Panic attacks
have triggers, right?

12:32.627 --> 12:34.629
Negative words
or thoughts.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.465
- Yep.
- Well,

12:36.548 --> 12:38.925
there's this theory
that by repeatedly vocalizing

12:39.009 --> 12:41.595
those triggers,
you can decouple them from their power.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.889
Like cognitive defusion.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.933
There's an app.
Basically, you record your anxieties,

12:47.017 --> 12:50.145
and the app then
turns them into songs.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.396
I think it's admirable

12:51.480 --> 12:54.191
that you want to do
everything you can to help your patients,

12:54.274 --> 12:58.236
but offering up gimmicks
in an emergency setting,

12:58.320 --> 12:59.696
I really don't
see the benefit.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.283
You know, the best care for Ms. Patel
is with her regular psychiatrist.

13:03.366 --> 13:05.452
So I suggest that
you discharge her,

13:05.535 --> 13:08.497
and that she follow up
with whoever that might be.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.291
Okay? Okay.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.761
How's he doing?

13:22.844 --> 13:24.596
Yeah, well,
no solid organ injury,

13:24.679 --> 13:27.432
but I'm not liking
this free fluid in his abdomen.

13:27.516 --> 13:30.101
Well, his blood
pressure's steady.

13:30.185 --> 13:31.603
Doesn't seem like
he's actively bleeding.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.063
Could be nothing,

13:33.146 --> 13:35.065
or it could be a bleed
we can't see on CAT scan.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.901
Let's get Mr. Minguez
in for a diagnostic laparoscopy.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.819
See if we can find
out what's bleeding and how badly.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.030
Well, couldn't
we just watch and wait?

13:42.113 --> 13:44.407
And risk an open procedure
if he goes downhill?

13:44.491 --> 13:46.826
I don't think so.
Surgery's the only play.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.120
Wait, so you're not gonna
lay out his options?

13:49.204 --> 13:50.413
He might not need surgery.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.415
Well, you saw
how he acted earlier.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.335
He's afraid of going under.
We give him an out and he'll take it.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.128
No, he needs this.

13:57.212 --> 13:58.463
We don't know
what he needs.

13:58.547 --> 14:00.298
It's a surgery to see
if he needs surgery.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.717
As much as I value your
input, Nurse Sexton,

14:02.801 --> 14:04.803
I am the surgeon
and this is the plan.

14:05.595 --> 14:08.223
All right,
if you'll excuse me.

14:12.811 --> 14:16.690
Wait, you want to keep
my kid here?

14:16.773 --> 14:18.900
No, no, no.
She said that I could take him home.

14:18.984 --> 14:20.735
So that's what I'm gonna do.
I'm doing that.

14:20.819 --> 14:24.489
Whoa, whoa.
Here's the story. Uh...

14:26.741 --> 14:28.827
If you insist on
discharging your son,

14:28.910 --> 14:30.662
we're gonna be left
with no other option

14:30.745 --> 14:32.664
than to call Child
Protective Services.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.291
Child Services? Why?

14:34.374 --> 14:37.168
You're not currently capable
of taking care of your child.

14:37.252 --> 14:40.505
I told you, this was
the only time that this has ever happened.

14:40.589 --> 14:44.009
Lynne, you know I'm right.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.802
Is there anyone else
we can call?

14:45.885 --> 14:47.846
Jesse's father?
An aunt or uncle?

14:47.929 --> 14:49.055
- No!
- Okay.

14:49.139 --> 14:50.265
It's just us.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.561
- Well...
- (SOBS) Oh, my God.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.524
My baby's gonna be
taken away from me.

14:59.608 --> 15:02.152
Not if we get you
in a better place.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.237
You said you've attempted
to get clean before.

15:04.321 --> 15:08.158
- What treatments have you tried?
- Methadone and NA,

15:08.241 --> 15:12.245
- and cold turkey. Nothing works.
- Ever tried a detox protocol?

15:12.329 --> 15:14.706
That's a month
in a facility.

15:14.789 --> 15:17.000
Who's gonna take
care of my kid?

15:17.083 --> 15:18.501
What if we sped
things up?

15:18.585 --> 15:19.711
(SIGHS)

15:25.091 --> 15:27.260
It's called
rapid detox.

15:27.344 --> 15:30.305
Yeah, now, I normally wouldn't suggest it,
but we don't have much time.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.557
We push you through withdrawal
under sedation

15:32.641 --> 15:35.852
to manage the symptoms,
and in 24 to 48 hours,

15:35.935 --> 15:38.772
you'll be down the road
to treating your addiction.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.273
Withdrawal.

15:40.357 --> 15:43.151
The last time I went through that,
it almost killed me.

15:43.234 --> 15:45.362
It is not without risk,

15:45.445 --> 15:47.614
but I don't know
what I can do to keep you together.

15:55.580 --> 15:58.124
- Can I say goodbye to my son?
-Of course.

16:03.088 --> 16:04.130
Hold up.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.257
Hey.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.177
Looks like we're gonna stay here
for a couple days.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.429
What? No!

16:11.513 --> 16:12.764
It'll be fun.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.308
Remember, like,

16:15.392 --> 16:17.936
when we had that leak
in the bathroom?

16:18.019 --> 16:20.689
We had to go stay
in that hotel.

16:20.772 --> 16:24.442
What was that secret
handshake we made up?

16:29.781 --> 16:32.075
That's it. Okay.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.577
Well, you be good
for the doctors, okay?

16:35.704 --> 16:36.830
Okay?

16:47.006 --> 16:49.008
So they're really gonna
stick a camera inside me?

16:49.092 --> 16:51.094
It's a lot less dramatic
than it sounds.

16:52.095 --> 16:53.263
That's what
they told my dad

16:53.346 --> 16:55.348
when he needed
a new heart valve.

16:55.432 --> 16:58.560
He had a stroke under anesthesia.
Never woke up.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.063
Alex, I am so sorry.

17:02.147 --> 17:05.567
You know, this procedure
is minimally invasive,

17:05.650 --> 17:09.237
very safe, and Dr. Marcel
is a great surgeon.

17:09.320 --> 17:12.741
I'm sure he is, but it's just hard
not to think about.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.701
If you have any questions,
I can track him down.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.912
I just... Is this really
my only option?

17:28.256 --> 17:29.340
How's she doing?

17:29.424 --> 17:30.800
Okay for now.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.302
Got the dexmedetomidine
flowing.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.429
- Ativan at the ready.
- She still rousable?

17:39.768 --> 17:42.562
Hi, Lynne. I need you
to swallow this pill.

17:42.645 --> 17:43.646
What is it?

17:43.730 --> 17:46.357
Naltrexone, to prevent
you from relapsing.

17:49.778 --> 17:51.905
Will, what are you doing?

17:52.822 --> 17:54.866
Starting her on
a rapid detox protocol.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.201
Has this been authorized?

17:58.036 --> 17:59.829
You said we were
all kosher here.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.247
Asha, don't worry.
We are.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.793
Really, Will?
Rapid detox?

18:04.876 --> 18:06.419
Plenty of clinics
are doing this, Nat.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.755
- We're not off the reservation here.
- Does she understand the risks?

18:08.838 --> 18:11.090
- She does.
- Even if she gets through this,

18:11.174 --> 18:12.759
even if the procedure's
a success,

18:12.842 --> 18:15.637
addiction is not something
that can be cured rapidly.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.598
There are a host of triggers
that Lynne's gonna have to overcome.

18:18.681 --> 18:20.892
Of course, and this
will be a head start.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.519
Get her past the cravings,
the withdrawals...

18:22.602 --> 18:25.313
- I don't know.
- I can't be the reason she loses her kid.

18:25.396 --> 18:26.397
I gotta make this right.

18:31.069 --> 18:32.779
The hell'd you do?

18:32.862 --> 18:34.864
My patient just backed out
of his laparoscopy.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.491
Alex was concerned
about the procedure.

18:36.574 --> 18:39.077
- I just answered his questions.
- But he already consented.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.538
Because you made
him believe he didn't have a choice.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.331
And you may be okay
keeping people in the dark,

18:43.414 --> 18:44.874
but you can't just
assume that I am.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.085
"In the dark"?
What are we talking about here?

18:47.168 --> 18:49.712
- Our patient or Ethan?
- Ethan? What?

18:50.880 --> 18:53.591
I just want to make sure
Alex knows his options.

18:53.675 --> 18:56.010
He has no options, April.

18:56.094 --> 18:58.054
This procedure gets riskier
every minute we wait.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.015
When we're rushing this man
to the OR in shock,

19:01.099 --> 19:02.433
it's on you.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.195
So...

19:14.946 --> 19:17.991
You wanna tell me what's going on
with you and Dr. Marcel?

19:18.074 --> 19:19.659
There's nothing going on.

19:19.742 --> 19:23.496
Hey, I can't have my sister and my mentor
slugging it out every day.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.415
- Noah...
- Spill it. Give it up.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.583
MAGGIE: Dr. Sexton?
- Hmm?

19:26.666 --> 19:27.834
If you're looking
for something to do,

19:27.917 --> 19:30.420
Dr. Lanik has
a forearm laceration

19:30.503 --> 19:31.671
that needs stitching.

19:38.803 --> 19:41.306
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

19:41.389 --> 19:43.641
Maybe something you wanna talk about
with a girlfriend?

19:58.907 --> 19:59.908
(BREATH TREMBLING)

19:59.991 --> 20:01.367
I kissed Crockett.

20:02.452 --> 20:03.536
Okay.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.121
It was a mistake.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.832
I had just found out
some really bad news.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.876
I was feeling
worthless. I...

20:09.959 --> 20:11.377
What news?

20:13.838 --> 20:16.716
Ethan and I have been

20:16.799 --> 20:19.594
trying for a baby,

20:19.677 --> 20:21.804
and I found out

20:21.888 --> 20:24.307
that I may not be able
to have any.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.392
Oh...

20:26.476 --> 20:27.644
April.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.187
Come here.

20:33.358 --> 20:35.401
ELSA: I'm sorry,
Ms. Patel.

20:35.485 --> 20:39.072
- So that's it? You're sending me home?
- Medically speaking,

20:39.155 --> 20:40.949
there is no reason to keep you
in the hospital.

20:41.032 --> 20:43.451
You're telling me
there's nothing you can do?

20:44.994 --> 20:46.120
Um...

20:47.121 --> 20:48.998
No, no, there is
one thing we can try.

20:49.082 --> 20:53.294
It's not a proven therapy,
but it's been working for me.

20:53.378 --> 20:55.797
All right, whatever
gives you anxiety,

20:55.880 --> 20:57.715
you speak it
into this app,

20:57.799 --> 21:00.635
and it turns those
words into a song.

21:00.718 --> 21:03.221
The theory is that
when you sing it back,

21:03.304 --> 21:06.516
you uncouple the words
from the influence that they had over you.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.518
Disrupt the cycle
of negative thinking.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.062
What do I say?

21:11.145 --> 21:13.815
Oh, I don't know, anything.
Anything that stresses you out.

21:15.566 --> 21:17.902
Am I good at my job?

21:17.986 --> 21:20.238
I think I am,
but it's hard to know.

21:20.321 --> 21:21.990
Good, okay.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.909
Great, now
sing it back.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.412
Um...

21:27.495 --> 21:29.497
(SINGING)
Am I good at my job?

21:29.580 --> 21:31.499
I think I am

21:31.582 --> 21:33.668
No, I can't do this.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.586
- I feel stupid.
- No, that was good.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.505
- Just try it.
- No, I don't want to.

21:37.588 --> 21:39.465
- Okay.
- Oh, God.

21:39.549 --> 21:40.883
All right, yeah, no.
We can try that later.

- You know what,

21:42.135 --> 21:43.136
if taking my antidepressants

21:43.219 --> 21:44.804
is all I really need to do,
then I'm just gonna do that.

21:44.887 --> 21:47.181
No, no, I wouldn't take
your meds off–schedule.

21:47.265 --> 21:48.307
Okay.

21:48.391 --> 21:50.893
God, I just want
to get out of here.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.063
(SIGHS)
- Okay.

21:57.567 --> 21:59.027
(LAUGHS)

21:59.110 --> 22:01.320
Look at you.
Come on, give it to me.

22:01.404 --> 22:02.822
Give it to me, huh?

22:02.905 --> 22:04.157
Working that gown.

22:05.742 --> 22:07.910
They let you wear
whatever you want during chemo.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.871
Well, the good news,

22:09.954 --> 22:12.790
radiation goes
by a lot quicker.

22:12.874 --> 22:15.960
The bad, they don't got
those plush La–Z–Boys.

22:16.044 --> 22:17.211
And...

22:18.880 --> 22:20.465
We can't go in together.

22:25.053 --> 22:26.137
Heard you were
down here.

22:27.305 --> 22:28.431
Hey, Dr. Singh.

22:29.182 --> 22:30.641
I didn't know you sat in
during these things.

22:30.725 --> 22:33.853
I'm here
to see Ben, actually.

22:33.936 --> 22:36.397
I wanted to do this
in person.

22:36.481 --> 22:38.024
Is it okay that
Maggie's here?

22:39.442 --> 22:40.735
Uh–huh.

22:40.818 --> 22:44.280
I reviewed your blood work,
and it seems

22:44.363 --> 22:46.199
that whatever jumpstarted
your immune system

22:46.282 --> 22:48.701
to fight off the measles
had the added benefit

22:48.785 --> 22:51.037
of putting your
cancer in remission.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.914
What?

22:52.997 --> 22:54.207
You're kidding, right?

22:54.290 --> 22:56.501
No, I'm not.

22:56.584 --> 22:59.087
- Congratulations, Ben.
- Oh, my God.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.340
Oh, my God, Ben.

23:02.423 --> 23:03.883
I'm so happy
for you, Ben.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.719
Yes! Thank you!

Yes! Come on!
Let's go!

(BOTH LAUGHING)

23:27.865 --> 23:31.160
Okay, I'm really sorry
that I couldn't do more for you.

I'll manage.

are you okay?

- I can't...

Okay, I need epi.

24:01.524 --> 24:02.733
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

- Seizure's not breaking.
- BP's spiking, 180 over 100.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.677
She needs a propofol
bolus, Will.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.679
- We gotta snow her.
- All right, do it.

How's your patient?

25:22.855 --> 25:24.190
Oh. Uh...

25:24.273 --> 25:27.401
She had another panic attack,
but she's stable.

25:27.485 --> 25:30.529
- Dr. Lanik just ordered repeat labs.
- She had another one?

25:30.613 --> 25:32.198
Any ideas on the trigger?

25:32.949 --> 25:34.700
(SIGHS) Dr. Charles,
I'm really sorry.

25:34.784 --> 25:36.244
I couldn't send her
home with nothing.

25:36.327 --> 25:38.412
So, I had her
try the singing.

25:38.496 --> 25:40.623
And you think that that's why she had
another episode?

25:40.706 --> 25:43.876
Yeah, well, she got really anxious,
and then she took another anti–depressant,

25:43.960 --> 25:46.128
and I don't know.
I think this is my fault.

25:46.212 --> 25:49.590
Wait, wait, wait. She took a second dose
on top of her regular prescription?

25:49.674 --> 25:51.550
- Yes.
- When exactly did she do that?

25:51.634 --> 25:53.552
Maybe 20 minutes
before she collapsed.

25:53.636 --> 25:56.347
But panic attacks
are typically an immediate response

25:56.430 --> 25:57.974
to a stressor,
not time–delayed.

25:58.057 --> 26:01.686
And an extra antidepressant
wouldn't provoke a toxic response anyway.

26:01.769 --> 26:06.023
Look, why don't we add
an FBC and tryptase to her blood work?

26:06.107 --> 26:08.192
More tests?
What are you thinking?

26:08.276 --> 26:11.237
I don't know yet,
but I'm not positive

26:11.320 --> 26:12.655
we're looking
at panic attacks here.

26:14.031 --> 26:15.241

NATALIE: Your mom told me that you kept
some of your favorite books in here.

26:19.996 --> 26:21.956
Why don't you pick
one out for us to read?

26:25.584 --> 26:28.504
Why was that doctor
sticking something down my mommy's throat?

26:29.797 --> 26:30.840
To help her breathe.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.843
It's 'cause of that
stuff she takes, isn't it?

26:36.137 --> 26:37.555
Have you ever heard
of a bad habit?

26:39.265 --> 26:42.184
So, I used to bite
my nails all the time,

26:42.268 --> 26:43.686
and that's a bad habit.

26:43.769 --> 26:47.023
And sometimes it's really hard to stop
when you're so used to doing it.

26:47.106 --> 26:50.526
My mom has a bad habit,
doesn't she?

26:51.569 --> 26:53.821
And it's making
her sick.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.906
Is that why I have
to stay here tonight?

26:55.990 --> 26:59.660
Well, it's a little more complicated
than that, Jesse.

26:59.744 --> 27:01.162
'Cause I can take
care of her.

27:15.009 --> 27:17.136

how to use it?

If I find my mom
and I can't wake her up,

27:19.847 --> 27:23.517
I tilt her head back and squirt
one of these in her nose.

27:24.226 --> 27:25.978

- A couple times.

about my mom,

about my cancer, I just...

28:47.101 --> 28:48.185
I went a little wild.

28:48.269 --> 28:49.937
For good reason.

28:50.020 --> 28:52.690
But still,
it was selfish,

28:52.773 --> 28:54.483
given where you are
in your fight.

28:56.110 --> 28:57.945
I don't want to
go out and celebrate.

to inform you, Lynne,

30:41.090 --> 30:42.132
Lynne, I didn't do this.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.261
You lied to me.

- We had a deal.
- The terms changed.

- When did that happen?
- When Jesse told me that

- I shouldn't have pushed so hard.

31:50.492 --> 31:52.953
You were just trying to do the best thing
for your patient.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.790
I've been thinking
about it, and, um...

31:58.792 --> 32:00.502
I think maybe
you were right.

32:00.586 --> 32:03.172
Sometimes people
don't need to know everything.

32:05.507 --> 32:07.384
I don't think
I should tell him.

32:09.678 --> 32:10.679
Okay.

32:17.353 --> 32:19.938
- Systemic what?
DANIEL: Mastocytosis.

32:20.022 --> 32:22.316
It's a genetic condition.
Completely manageable.

32:22.399 --> 32:25.319
Okay, but what about
my panic attacks?

32:25.402 --> 32:27.821
Shortness of breath, elevated heart rate,
loss of consciousness,

32:27.905 --> 32:30.407
all symptoms of panic attacks
and mastocytosis.

32:30.491 --> 32:31.784
Except mastocytosis

32:31.867 --> 32:34.370
can actually be made worse
by taking antidepressants.

32:34.453 --> 32:38.123
So the fluoxetine was not
only not treating anything,

32:38.207 --> 32:39.416
but that extra
dose you took?

32:39.500 --> 32:41.377
Probably what made you
pass out in our waiting room.

32:41.460 --> 32:44.129
But my stress is real.

32:44.213 --> 32:47.132
Probably just good old–fashioned
job–related stress.

32:47.216 --> 32:50.219
Look, we're going to check
in with your psychiatrist,

32:50.302 --> 32:51.553
but in the meantime,
what we want to do

32:51.637 --> 32:54.765
is swap out your antidepressants
for antihistamines.

32:54.848 --> 32:56.475
- Okay?
- Okay.

32:56.558 --> 32:57.685
Thank you.

32:57.768 --> 32:59.603
- Really.
- You bet.

33:07.236 --> 33:09.154
- What are you doing?
- Deleting this app.

33:09.238 --> 33:10.489
It doesn't work.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.704
Mastocytosis should have
been on my differential from the start,

33:16.787 --> 33:19.873
but I got so focused
on this app that I...

33:19.957 --> 33:22.960
- I totally missed it.
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

33:23.043 --> 33:27.214
Look, you came up with a creative idea
to solve a tricky problem.

33:27.297 --> 33:30.050
It didn't happen to work, but...
I mean, look at it this way.

33:30.134 --> 33:32.136
If you hadn't of tried it,
Priya would have gone home

33:32.219 --> 33:33.721
thinking she still
had a panic disorder.

33:33.804 --> 33:35.597
Because she rejected
my bad idea.

33:36.724 --> 33:38.475
Like you said,
it's just a gimmick.

33:38.559 --> 33:40.310
You can't sing away
your problems.

I've been thinking about it a lot
over the last six weeks.

34:17.306 --> 34:18.307
Me, too.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.893
Sit. Um...

34:22.603 --> 34:26.064
You and I, we've been working so hard
and trying to start a family,

34:26.148 --> 34:29.109
and I think I got
caught up in planning

34:29.193 --> 34:32.529
that I forgot what the objective
of the mission really was.

34:32.613 --> 34:34.531
(CHUCKLES)

34:35.240 --> 34:36.617
I'm sorry, I didn't

34:37.868 --> 34:39.703
want to make it
sound like a briefing.

34:39.787 --> 34:41.538
(CHUCKLES) It's okay.

34:42.873 --> 34:44.082
But you...

34:44.875 --> 34:46.210
But you need to know

34:50.255 --> 34:51.548
that I...

34:54.510 --> 34:55.552
I love you,

34:56.512 --> 34:59.014
and I love your passion

34:59.097 --> 35:01.809
and your loyalty.

35:03.727 --> 35:06.188
And I don't want to go

35:06.271 --> 35:08.440
another six weeks
without you in my life.

35:10.901 --> 35:12.110
So...

35:19.076 --> 35:20.160
(EXHALES)

35:20.244 --> 35:21.537
April Sexton...

35:21.620 --> 35:23.038
(GASPS)

35:24.957 --> 35:26.333
Will you marry me?

35:38.053 --> 35:39.930
This a good silence?

35:40.013 --> 35:42.307
Before I answer that, um...

35:47.521 --> 35:49.481
I need to tell you something.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.610
It might change
your mind.

35:55.779 --> 35:56.822
Okay.

35:58.532 --> 35:59.575
I...

36:00.534 --> 36:01.827
I got tested,

36:03.203 --> 36:04.872
and I don't think
I can have kids.

36:08.792 --> 36:10.794
- I'm sorry.
- Baby, no.

36:10.878 --> 36:12.170
No, I'm sorry.

36:12.254 --> 36:14.214
But, hey, that's okay.

36:15.048 --> 36:17.384
Look, I love you
no matter what, okay?

36:17.467 --> 36:18.844
We'll figure this
out together.

36:20.387 --> 36:22.097
I love you so much.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.391
So much.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.060
So is that a yes?

36:27.853 --> 36:29.187
- Yes.
(CHUCKLES)

36:29.271 --> 36:30.814
Yes!

36:33.150 --> 36:34.818
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

36:34.902 --> 36:36.028
Whoo!

36:45.162 --> 36:47.706
I'm glad you came
out tonight.

36:47.789 --> 36:51.460
You know, I figured CeCe
probably would have approved.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.295
Oh, yeah.
Sure she would've.

36:53.378 --> 36:56.506
All right, thank you all
for coming tonight.

36:56.590 --> 36:58.926
I'm gonna miss you
all so much.

36:59.009 --> 37:00.719
MAN: We'll miss you
too, Lainey!

37:00.802 --> 37:02.262
All right, all right.

37:02.346 --> 37:05.057
Up next, Dr. C!

37:05.140 --> 37:06.767
Let's make some noise!

37:06.850 --> 37:08.518
Seriously?

37:11.063 --> 37:13.065
Seriously,
you're gonna sing?

37:14.149 --> 37:15.776
He's gonna sing?

37:22.449 --> 37:24.743
A friend of mine told me

37:24.826 --> 37:28.830
that you can't sing
away your troubles.

37:30.082 --> 37:33.043
Well, I guess
we're about to find out.

37:33.126 --> 37:34.544
(MUSIC PLAYING)

37:40.425 --> 37:43.345
(SINGING)
There you go and, baby

37:43.428 --> 37:45.347
Here am I

37:45.430 --> 37:48.100
Well, you left me here

37:48.183 --> 37:50.143
So I could

37:50.227 --> 37:51.895
Sit and cry

37:53.105 --> 37:58.527
Golly gee
What have you done to me?

37:58.610 --> 38:02.489
Well, I guess it doesn't
matter anymore

38:05.200 --> 38:08.203
Do you remember, baby

38:08.286 --> 38:12.040
Last September, how you

38:12.124 --> 38:13.625
Held me tight

38:13.709 --> 38:17.170
Each and every night

38:17.254 --> 38:20.799
And, oh, baby, how you

38:20.882 --> 38:23.260
Drove me crazy

38:23.343 --> 38:27.681
Well, I guess it doesn't
matter anymore

38:57.711 --> 38:58.754
A little help?

38:59.796 --> 39:02.299
Baghdad.
Dr. Halstead?

39:02.382 --> 39:04.718
EMT: 35–year–old female.
Found down, unresponsive.

39:04.801 --> 39:06.970
- Looks like an OD.
- No response to Narcan.

39:07.054 --> 39:08.847
She's been shocked
and epi'd once already.

39:16.271 --> 39:19.691
On my count.
One, two, three.

39:20.567 --> 39:21.610
NURSE: Will.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.243
Continue CPR.
Crash cart!

39:31.036 --> 39:33.163
- She's in v–fib, no pulse.
- Charge to 200.

39:35.457 --> 39:37.417
Lift up. All right,
let's go.

39:37.501 --> 39:39.711
We are not
losing her. Clear.

39:41.421 --> 39:42.672
Pulse.

39:44.132 --> 39:45.634
- No pulse.
- Continue CPR.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.427
Another round
of epi. Charge.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.305
Let's go.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.765
Clear.

39:53.433 --> 39:54.810
Come on, Lynne.

39:54.893 --> 39:55.894
Pulse?

39:56.978 --> 39:59.022
(PULSE FLATLINING)

40:00.273 --> 40:02.818
It's been 11 minutes now
without one.

40:03.944 --> 40:04.945
Eleven minutes?

40:06.780 --> 40:07.864
Halstead,

40:08.698 --> 40:09.699
pronounce her.

40:31.138 --> 40:33.265
Time of death, 20:43.

40:38.895 --> 40:39.938
I'm sorry.

40:49.030 --> 40:51.658
