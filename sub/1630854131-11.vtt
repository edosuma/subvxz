WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:05.806
What I need from you
is a larger finder's fee.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.241
I don't renegotiate.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.710
- A deal's a deal.
- Track him down.

00:09.710 --> 00:13.181
It's Avery. I-I think something
terrible might've happened.

00:13.181 --> 00:15.049
I think Avery is making
a play for the money

00:15.049 --> 00:16.650
that Luke and Paige stole.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.986
So, what's so important
about that bag of yours?

00:18.986 --> 00:20.020
There's something in it
I need.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.355
Help me get it back

00:21.355 --> 00:23.224
and I'll help you
get Walter out.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.593
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

00:25.593 --> 00:28.429
If he can't find Paige,
we are all in big trouble.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.064
I don't know why

00:30.064 --> 00:32.700
you thought it was a good idea
to stick around.

00:38.172 --> 00:39.039
What the hell?

00:41.041 --> 00:42.110
Mom.

00:44.945 --> 00:47.415
What happened?

00:47.415 --> 00:49.049
I messed up.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.418
Bad.

00:50.418 --> 00:51.452
And I need your help.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.354
Help.
After what you did?

00:53.354 --> 00:54.388
Where's the 30 grand
you stole from me?

00:54.388 --> 00:55.423
Jenny, you gotta
believe me.

00:55.423 --> 00:56.690
We gotta
get out of here now.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.393
Where's the 30 grand
that you stole from me?

00:59.393 --> 01:01.129
If I tell you,
will you listen to me?

01:06.033 --> 01:07.235
It's gone.

01:07.235 --> 01:09.703
I hired some local
to launder it

01:09.703 --> 01:12.306
so I could fix a problem,
but I messed up.

01:12.306 --> 01:15.743
I grifted the wrong guy,
and his family is crazy.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.611
And if we don't get
outta here right now,

01:17.611 --> 01:19.247
we're both gonna be
in a world of trouble.

01:19.247 --> 01:20.414
Let me see your hands.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.450
Show me.

01:22.450 --> 01:23.551
What are you doing?!

01:23.551 --> 01:26.053
- Ow!
- You'll be safer in jail.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.921
Please! Jenny, please,
you gotta believe me.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.257
I'm not lying to you--

01:29.257 --> 01:31.392
I can't do this
with you anymore, Mom!

01:31.392 --> 01:34.061
I don't know what mess
you got yourself into,

01:34.061 --> 01:35.929
but maybe jail
and a court-appointed lawyer

01:35.929 --> 01:37.398
can help sort it out.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.267
Jenny...

01:39.267 --> 01:41.602
Oh, God. Oh, God,
th-they're here.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.337
- Jenny, please, get your gun!
- Cut-- Cut the drama.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.105
I'm not lying!
Please!

01:45.105 --> 01:46.240
Help me.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.308
Bad guys don't knock.

01:47.308 --> 01:48.476
No, wai--

01:48.476 --> 01:50.811
- Oh, my God. I just...
- Jenny?

01:50.811 --> 01:52.913
(distorted) Jenny!

01:55.649 --> 01:57.851
Yeah, that's her. Let's go.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.822
Get her up!

02:01.822 --> 02:04.325
- MAN ♪2: Come on, now!
- No!

02:04.325 --> 02:06.527
Grab this camera here.

02:06.527 --> 02:07.595
MAN ♪2:
You're coming with us.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.044
Would you please
put that thing down?

02:24.044 --> 02:25.946
- I'm not going anywhere.
- I'd rather not.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.117
Any sign of Paige?

02:30.117 --> 02:31.852
No. I looked everywhere.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.354
My socks are wet.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.189
I got stinging nettles.

02:35.189 --> 02:37.358
- What kind of game is this?
- Game?

02:37.358 --> 02:39.827
Guys, Paige came to me
asking for help.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.995
Why would I haul your asses
up here to meet her

02:41.995 --> 02:42.963
if that wasn't true?

02:44.365 --> 02:47.335
Well, then she's playing
both of us.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.537
Either that
or somebody else took her.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.574
Who else has access
to this camp?

02:58.646 --> 03:01.048
There you go.

03:11.459 --> 03:12.660
You want some pie?

03:12.660 --> 03:14.595
I'm good.

03:21.068 --> 03:22.703
So what can I do
for you, Cassie?

03:22.703 --> 03:24.272
I wanted to talk
to Sunny and you--

03:24.272 --> 03:25.273
Well, we're
talking right now.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.675
And you have refused
Sunny's pie,

03:27.675 --> 03:29.277
which makes me
think you've got something

03:29.277 --> 03:30.878
"problematic"
on your mind.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.247
So just spit it out,

03:33.247 --> 03:34.915
'cause the night's
killed the day,

03:34.915 --> 03:36.850
and I got a lot
of stuff to do.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.519
At this hour?

03:38.519 --> 03:39.453
Idle hands.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.689
I, uh...

03:41.689 --> 03:43.391
try to stay
away from 'em.

03:51.965 --> 03:55.068
You know, we have this man,
Walter, in custody.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.236
Yeah, the loner
that you think

03:56.236 --> 03:57.805
did the Bleeding Heart Murder.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.873
Wh-Where did they
catch that animal? Huh?

03:59.873 --> 04:01.342
Oh, Buck, drop the act.

04:03.411 --> 04:05.078
Sunny is Walter's
birth mother.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.780
And you lied
about the truck.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.782
So I'm questioning
a lot of things right now.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.985
Yeah.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.921
Well, seems like
you have all the answers,

04:13.921 --> 04:16.457
so good for you.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.125
You knew
all this time?

04:20.193 --> 04:21.795
Walter had help.

04:21.795 --> 04:25.666
Are-- Are you saying Sunny
helped him kill people?

04:25.666 --> 04:29.837
She or you helped him evade
capture all these years.

04:35.275 --> 04:39.347
No, he was a cancer
in our family,

04:39.347 --> 04:41.649
and I couldn't make her see
what a danger he was.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.452
So what was I supposed
to do, Cassie?

04:44.452 --> 04:46.520
Excuse me.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.126
Hey, Jenny.
What's up?

04:54.928 --> 04:56.330
Hold up.
You okay?

04:58.332 --> 04:59.933
Okay.
St-Stay put.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.635
I'll be right there.

05:34.301 --> 05:36.203
Now, what did
you go and do?

05:47.080 --> 05:48.382
Hey, what
are you doing?

05:49.683 --> 05:51.585
I can't sleep.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.521
Come join me.
I could use the company.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.823
Here.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.458
Thanks.

06:07.535 --> 06:09.937
You know, Avery's not
a bad person.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.905
Well, he's not
a good one, Em.

06:11.905 --> 06:14.708
He's trying to steal
$15 million.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.446
That money may have got
someone killed.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.748
He's put you and he's put
your mom in danger.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.618
And I'm sitting here
trying to rack my brain...

06:24.618 --> 06:26.053
what she sees
in that guy.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.089
Sorry, I shouldn't say
that to you.

06:31.324 --> 06:33.126
You know, maybe it's not
about money for him.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.897
Avery's a rich guy.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.398
He probably wants
to stay that way.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.633
Yeah, 'cause he
thinks that,

06:39.633 --> 06:40.968
without it,
he might lose her.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.107
Why don't we talk
about something else?

06:48.008 --> 06:49.142
Okay.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.212
- Any topic?
- Let's dive deep.

06:52.212 --> 06:53.781
Take your best shot.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.820
What happened
in Houston...

06:59.820 --> 07:01.989
with your partner?

07:05.158 --> 07:07.094
You know what happened.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.596
Yeah, I know
what "happened,"

07:08.596 --> 07:12.132
but, like,
not from you.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.867
You never
talked about it.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.405
There's not
much to know.

07:18.405 --> 07:19.973
Not much
to talk about.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.144
Okay.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.314
Come on, Em,
where you going?

07:31.184 --> 07:33.521
Mom never needed you
to be perfect.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.624
You know?

07:36.624 --> 07:38.592
She just wanted you
to let her in more.

07:51.004 --> 07:55.375
Jenny, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.678
Yeah, she showed up
at the house.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.147
Someone roughed her up.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.649
Did she say who?

08:01.649 --> 08:04.017
Something about grifting
the wrong guy.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.655
Sorry. Uh, is this
yours or your mom's?

08:07.655 --> 08:10.057
Have you ever seen me
with a purse?

08:10.057 --> 08:12.459
Right.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.662
Jenny, we gotta get you
to the hospital.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.196
She said that
they were after her.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.231
I just didn't believe her.

08:20.467 --> 08:21.869
I need to find her.

08:21.869 --> 08:22.903
Figure out who
these people are...

08:22.903 --> 08:24.004
Jenny.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.673
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no!

08:28.475 --> 08:31.579
All right. You're not
going anywhere right now.

08:31.579 --> 08:32.646
We got you.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.324
We found a motel key
in Gigi's purse.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.694
It was to an old dive
out in Great Falls.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.362
The room was paid in full
by a Gilbert Leeds.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.832
Rap sheet's pretty long.
Mostly petty crimes.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.702
But I'm guessing that's
Gigi's accomplice in the grift.

08:54.702 --> 08:57.204
A security cam caught
a truck speeding off

08:57.204 --> 08:58.071
at the time
of the attack.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.172
No plates, but...

08:59.172 --> 09:01.074
...we got horns.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.710
Please don't be from Texas.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.511
- Mm.
- We get anything else?

09:04.511 --> 09:06.747
What? You're not
supposed to be here.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.181
What, did you bust out
of the hospital?

09:08.181 --> 09:09.516
And did you hurt
anyone doing it?

09:11.051 --> 09:13.020
Hey.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.955
Thanks
for being here.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.890
Try and stop me.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.726
But you should
be home, resting.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.861
Well, I can't just sit around
while my mom's missing.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.229
What do we got?

09:22.229 --> 09:24.598
This is who she was
working with,

09:24.598 --> 09:26.366
and as you can see by
the state of the motel,

09:26.366 --> 09:28.902
she fought like hell
to escape.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.738
She's a fighter.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.940
Yeah, this is Arlen.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.475
Okay.
Yeah, copy that.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.945
Uh, patrol officer
has spotted Avery.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.446
Go.

09:39.446 --> 09:40.781
Yeah, we got this.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.415
- Okay, call me later.
- Yeah.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.386
Any idea how
we can find them?

09:46.386 --> 09:48.455
I know where to start.
Let's go.

09:48.455 --> 09:49.322
Yeah.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.933
I'm sorry about
all this mess.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.569
I never meant
to hurt you.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.705
I mean it.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.142
Yeah, that's
what you say.

10:19.586 --> 10:22.122
Mmm, there you are,
old friend.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.829
Today's your lucky day,
and I'll tell you why.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.467
This is the first drink

10:34.467 --> 10:36.136
I've had in 20 years.

10:39.372 --> 10:40.640
And I don't feel like
drinking alone.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.115
Aah!

10:49.783 --> 10:52.352
Don't bother screaming.
Nobody can hear you.

10:58.091 --> 11:01.061
Please,
just let me go.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.896
Everyone already
thinks I'm dead.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.164
Mm.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.565
Sunny doesn't.

11:05.565 --> 11:07.500
God bless her.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.003
She's kept me on the straight
and narrow all these years.

11:11.238 --> 11:12.740
If she could see me now...

11:14.007 --> 11:16.977
...there would be
hell to pay,

11:16.977 --> 11:18.411
lemme tell ya.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.480
I'll disappear.
Get out of the country.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.849
Walter stays in jail.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.217
You are a sharp girl.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.186
But then,
you know what happens

11:26.186 --> 11:27.420
to sharp girls.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.759
They meet sharp ends.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.994
No.

11:33.994 --> 11:37.564
No, no.

11:37.564 --> 11:38.665
- Mmm.
- Buck, please,

11:38.665 --> 11:39.833
no, please.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.401
Please, no, please!

11:41.401 --> 11:42.569
Buck, please, no!

11:42.569 --> 11:43.871
No, please, no--

12:08.929 --> 12:10.063
Smells good.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.303
Message from my boss...

12:17.637 --> 12:19.239
...he doesn't renegotiate.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.085
Avery.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.787
Who's your friend?

12:35.956 --> 12:37.891
His friend is none
of your concern.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.960
Well, actually, it is,

12:39.960 --> 12:41.294
seeing as
I'm the sheriff and all.

12:43.663 --> 12:44.865
Huh.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.335
I never shot
a sheriff before.

12:48.335 --> 12:51.138
Well, we're not gonna
do that, gunslinger.

12:51.138 --> 12:54.507
Beau, please,
just turn around, walk away.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.610
I'm handling it.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.512
I'm handling things,
all right?

12:59.512 --> 13:01.748
No, Avery, I think you're pretty
much done handling things.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.019
But you know what,
big fella?

13:07.988 --> 13:09.189
It's your lucky day.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.960
You can have him.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.964
I'll catch you later.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.209
Put your hands
on your head.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.579
Put your hands
on your head.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.187
Don't give me a reason
to make my life any easier.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.556
Avery hasn't been
to his house.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.358
His wife and Emily
are staying with Beau.

13:45.358 --> 13:46.726
Where is he?

13:46.726 --> 13:48.996
If he's staying at a hotel,
he's using a fake name

13:48.996 --> 13:50.330
because I checked 'em all.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.132
We have to find him.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.833
I'm not gonna let
Avery or anyone else

13:53.833 --> 13:54.902
get away with that money.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.403
It is ours, Donno.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.738
What would you
do with it?

14:00.874 --> 14:02.709
The $15 million.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.878
I'd scale up
the real-estate business.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.215
Own this town.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.252
Maybe start
a diner franchise.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.689
What about you?

14:16.689 --> 14:19.292
I saw a documentary
on fox hunting once.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.395
I'd like to breed foxes.

14:22.395 --> 14:26.266
Open a fox farm,
select the mean ones,

14:26.266 --> 14:27.867
breed them
with the other mean ones,

14:27.867 --> 14:29.903
and then the mean ones
with the smart ones.

14:29.903 --> 14:32.072
- What for?
- Super foxes.

14:32.072 --> 14:35.775
Fish-and-chipper comes around
the corner with his hounds,

14:35.775 --> 14:38.211
finds 50 super foxes
waiting for him.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.013
I see you've
thought this out.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.249
My favorite movie--

14:42.249 --> 14:43.450
<i>The Fox and the Hound--</i>

14:44.651 --> 14:46.019
Tod and Copper just
wanted to be friends.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.487
But the world just...

14:49.056 --> 14:50.857
And they had to hide
their feelings.

14:50.857 --> 14:52.960
It's a good one.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.062
Tonya.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.463
Sign says we're closed.

14:56.463 --> 14:57.697
I know you laundered
money for Gigi.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.632
She said, "We're closed."

14:59.632 --> 15:00.900
30 grand she stole.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.370
She said she used a local.
It had to be you.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.737
Don't know what
you're talking about.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.574
Gigi was taken by some
very dangerous people.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.875
- It happens.
- Not us.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.077
Okay, cut the BS.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.113
I just (sighs)--
I need your help.

15:14.781 --> 15:17.550
Tonya,
this isn't about you.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.486
Just tell us who you
delivered the money to.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.822
Please.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.326
She's my mother.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.701
It's not a who,
it's a where.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.439
Left it at a drop box
on an empty parcel of land.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.642
I need an address.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.311
Of course.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.850
Where you headed?

15:50.850 --> 15:52.485
Out on an errand.
Where you been?

15:52.485 --> 15:54.454
- Out.
- All night?

15:54.454 --> 15:55.788
Not answering your phone?

15:55.788 --> 15:57.024
I found Paige.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.292
Where?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.161
Well,
it doesn't matter now.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.530
I had her stashed safe and sound
out at the camp,

16:03.530 --> 16:05.332
but when I went back,
she was gone.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.034
Hmm.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.368
I need you to help me
go find her.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.470
Yeah, I'm--
I'm not gonna do that.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.374
What the hell's
gotten into you?

16:14.374 --> 16:17.344
This is the last time
I'm gonna say this, Sunny.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.946
Leave the Paige
business alone.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.948
No good's gonna
come from that.

16:21.948 --> 16:24.684
Hell, Cassie Dewell's already
been out here askin' questions.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.153
About what?

16:26.153 --> 16:28.188
She knows
Walter's your son.

16:29.756 --> 16:30.823
That's right.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.559
You better start thinking

16:32.559 --> 16:34.327
about how that's gonna
blow back on you.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.996
I'm gonna do
what's right by my son.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.168
Something wrong?

16:41.168 --> 16:42.402
You been drinking.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.337
- No.
- I can smell it on you.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.706
- No, I haven't.
- Don't you lie to me.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.411
I'll tell you what--

16:51.411 --> 16:53.213
I'm gonna go
to the hardware store.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.414
I'm gonna come back,

16:54.414 --> 16:56.049
we'll fix
a pot of coffee,

16:56.049 --> 16:59.719
and you and I are gonna have
a real long conversation.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.088
All right?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.292
How about now?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.061
I got something I need
to take care of.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.433
Okay.
Not what I was expecting.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.867
Me neither.

17:47.867 --> 17:48.868
What were
you looking for?

17:48.868 --> 17:50.537
Not Grandma's house.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.105
Okay. So, the parcel that

17:52.105 --> 17:54.274
Donno said
that he dropped the money

17:54.274 --> 17:56.143
is registered
to an Anne Whitlow.

17:56.143 --> 18:00.447
<i>Late 60s, four sons and several
grandkids living with her.</i>

18:00.447 --> 18:03.950
As for the address
that you are now...

18:03.950 --> 18:07.487
Yep. It is registered
to the same Anne Whitlow.

18:07.487 --> 18:10.490
Big property, though.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.159
Not just a cute cottage.

18:12.159 --> 18:15.128
And it has several outbuildings
on the east side.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.896
Let's check it out.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.505
Hey, there.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.344
Hello?

18:31.344 --> 18:33.079
I'm Deputy Hoyt from
the Sheriff's Department.

18:33.079 --> 18:34.113
You must be
Anne Whitlow.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.815
Oh, call me Ma.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.784
- Everyone does.
- Anybody else home?

18:37.784 --> 18:41.321
Just me and,
uh, Buster.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.589
Best companion
in the world.

18:42.589 --> 18:43.990
What about
the young girl?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.227
Oh, that
must've been Fanny.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.763
She lost her mother young.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.366
She's a wildling, that one.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.335
Do you know who
Gigi Cessna is?

18:55.335 --> 18:57.637
No. Should I?

18:57.637 --> 19:00.507
She stole some money
that ended up in a drop box

19:00.507 --> 19:02.642
on a plot of land
that belongs to you.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.777
I don't know what plot
you're talking about.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.379
I got two full sections,

19:06.379 --> 19:09.782
and nobody ever dropped money.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.551
Sorry I couldn't be
more help.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.619
Thank you
for your time.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.187
Oh, yeah.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.055
- Do you believe her?
- Not a word.

19:16.055 --> 19:17.557
Let's split up
and take a look around.

19:17.557 --> 19:18.858
I'll hide your truck.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.198
Okay.

20:00.633 --> 20:01.768
Start talking.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.103
Well, I'm afraid
there's not much I can say.

20:04.103 --> 20:05.204
Why don't we start
with the guy

20:05.204 --> 20:06.406
who was just trying
to kill me, hmm?

20:06.406 --> 20:08.275
Who was that?

20:08.275 --> 20:09.742
Am I being charged
with something?

20:15.282 --> 20:17.116
You know, I found those

20:17.116 --> 20:18.451
journal pages
that you stole.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.688
Guess you're trying to
get your hands

20:21.688 --> 20:22.722
on that $15 million.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.757
Or maybe you already have it.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.259
I'm sorry. Did someone report
that money stolen?

20:27.427 --> 20:31.564
Because...
as far as I can make out,

20:31.564 --> 20:35.034
that is what is known
as a victimless crime.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.869
What's your plan, man?

20:36.869 --> 20:38.638
Hmm?

20:38.638 --> 20:39.772
New identity?

20:39.772 --> 20:41.374
Thailand?

20:41.374 --> 20:43.042
Or maybe you're not into
the whole heat thing.

20:43.042 --> 20:45.612
Winnipeg?

20:45.612 --> 20:47.714
You see, these people,
they don't forgive,

20:47.714 --> 20:49.782
and they don't forget.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.651
And the ones
that steal from them

20:51.651 --> 20:53.386
rarely die alone,

20:53.386 --> 20:55.054
which means you
have put Carla

20:55.054 --> 20:57.724
and you have put
my daughter into danger.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.892
Did you even
think about that?

20:59.892 --> 21:01.594
Everything I've done...

21:03.796 --> 21:07.199
...has been
to protect my family.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.304
That's all
you need to know.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.140
You, on the other hand,

21:14.140 --> 21:15.942
you've made quite
the tidy mess,

21:15.942 --> 21:17.310
haven't you?

21:17.310 --> 21:19.746
Killing that man

21:19.746 --> 21:22.349
put us all
in more danger.

21:27.153 --> 21:30.089
And now I'd very much like
to speak to my lawyer.

22:18.405 --> 22:19.672
I've heard enough.

22:21.908 --> 22:24.977
We're gonna have
some fun now, huh?

22:24.977 --> 22:26.579
Please.

22:26.579 --> 22:28.047
We'll give you back
everything we took.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.449
I promise.

22:30.617 --> 22:32.785
My brother's dead
because of you two.

22:35.087 --> 22:36.756
We didn't kill
your brother!

22:39.459 --> 22:41.728
Maybe what we need
are purer minds.

22:41.728 --> 22:44.631
Let the young ones decide
what to do with you two, hmm?

22:45.865 --> 22:48.200
Does this man
deserve our mercy...

22:50.870 --> 22:52.772
...or our wrath?

22:55.475 --> 22:56.909
No, please!

23:16.395 --> 23:18.698
Don't move,
or I'll shoot you.

23:18.698 --> 23:19.766
Jenny...

23:19.766 --> 23:21.067
I got this, Mom.

23:21.067 --> 23:27.139
Your choice--
put the popper on the ground,

23:27.139 --> 23:29.776
or I feed what's left of you
to the pigs.

23:36.683 --> 23:38.485
I'm so sorry, Jenny.

23:38.485 --> 23:40.319
Shut up!

23:40.319 --> 23:43.089
Ain't no one here
starvin' for platitudes.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.225
Put the gun on the ground.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.660
Now!

23:48.961 --> 23:50.429
There you go.

23:52.799 --> 23:55.267
You know, maybe now that we got
the next generation here,

23:55.267 --> 23:57.036
we don't need the OG model
after all.

23:58.538 --> 24:01.273
I like the look of her
way better.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.175
Is that right, Troy?

24:05.211 --> 24:07.146
- Mama, I--
- Pretty sure I taught you

24:07.146 --> 24:09.248
to respect
your elders and women.

24:09.248 --> 24:10.316
Robbie's dead
because of her!

24:10.316 --> 24:12.519
You raise your voice
again to me,

24:12.519 --> 24:14.487
and I'll take
your damn hand!

24:14.487 --> 24:16.355
Bring her to me!

24:18.224 --> 24:20.760
You don't want to do this. Please.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.429
Your mother cheated
my boy Robbie.

24:23.429 --> 24:25.131
Fanny's daddy.

24:25.131 --> 24:29.001
He put a shotgun under his chin
and left this world

24:29.001 --> 24:31.337
because of what your mama
and that man did.

24:31.337 --> 24:33.472
And then...

24:33.472 --> 24:37.810
they tried to pay
for his life with money.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.481
Now, what are we gonna do, children?

24:47.754 --> 24:49.589
Ohh. Joshua.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.729
This lady...

24:56.729 --> 24:59.398
hurt our family.

24:59.398 --> 25:02.101
What do you think
we should do with her?

25:04.270 --> 25:08.274
Bullets? Pigpen?
The pit?

25:12.378 --> 25:14.714
Well, how 'bout that!

25:15.915 --> 25:17.750
Joshua calls for a game.

25:17.750 --> 25:20.252
- What the hell is this?
- You heard me.

25:20.252 --> 25:23.022
A game for all the stakes
in the world.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.259
Your mother loses...

25:27.259 --> 25:29.228
she dies.

25:29.228 --> 25:32.231
At least she got a chance,

25:32.231 --> 25:34.133
which is more
than I can say for my son.

25:35.101 --> 25:37.036
Come on, get up!

25:37.036 --> 25:39.271
Let's play,
or we'll just shoot her!

25:39.271 --> 25:41.507
Okay. Okay.
Hey. Hey.

25:41.507 --> 25:44.076
I'll play in her place. Please.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.511
Hmm!

25:45.511 --> 25:47.513
You're gonna play, and you
don't even know what it is.

25:47.513 --> 25:51.083
Well!
That's twice the fun.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.419
You can play
against each other.

25:53.419 --> 25:55.254
Wha--

25:55.254 --> 25:56.923
Shackle 'em.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.659
- Come on.
- Go on with it.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.795
Oh, my God.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.430
Do it!

26:05.732 --> 26:07.967
Troy, there was another woman
with her. Go find her.

26:10.169 --> 26:12.471
Oh, and, uh...
take Fanny.

26:15.107 --> 26:16.575
She's the best tracker.

28:11.891 --> 28:13.059
Unh!

28:32.344 --> 28:33.980
You should've
listened to me.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.616
Let's just focus on
how to get out of here.

28:37.616 --> 28:40.119
My late son Robbie
loved this game.

28:40.119 --> 28:42.121
Played for hours.

28:42.121 --> 28:45.257
Rules are-- you get a sack
on the box, that's one point.

28:45.257 --> 28:47.526
You get one in the hole,
that's three points.

28:47.526 --> 28:50.029
No other rules.
One round only.

28:50.029 --> 28:52.865
Four tosses each.
Take turns.

28:52.865 --> 28:55.701
I'm sorry, Jenny. I never meant
for any of this to happen.

28:55.701 --> 28:57.069
I'm gonna get you out of here.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.871
How?

28:58.871 --> 28:59.872
Age before beauty.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.749
Looks like
you've got some fans.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.285
Everybody loves an underdog.
You're up.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.768
If you ruin Joshua's game

29:29.768 --> 29:31.938
by not trying
on your next toss,

29:31.938 --> 29:33.906
your mama goes to the pigs.

29:33.906 --> 29:37.309
And she goes alive.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.979
That's 1-0, for mama.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.682
You gotta try, Jenny.

29:43.682 --> 29:46.585
Only one of us is
getting out of here alive.

30:09.708 --> 30:14.513
Whatever happens, Jenny,
forgive me.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.315
You will never change.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.351
You want me to try?

30:21.320 --> 30:22.554
Fine.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.156
I'll try.

30:34.466 --> 30:37.369
Three points. 3-2.
Daughter takes the lead.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.705
We got ourselves
a game here.

30:51.517 --> 30:54.153
No. Uh, she's cheating.

30:54.153 --> 30:55.354
- Fat chance!
- No. She is.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.923
She's trying to lose
on purpose.

30:56.923 --> 30:58.324
My daughter, everyone.

30:58.324 --> 31:00.893
She's a bad loser.

31:00.893 --> 31:03.896
- What are you doing?
- And a bad winner.

31:03.896 --> 31:06.565
I don't think so.
She barely missed.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.772
Two can play
at that game.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.887
Last warning, girl!

31:28.887 --> 31:31.857
Cal, Stephen...

31:31.857 --> 31:34.626
please aim your weapons
at our players.

31:34.626 --> 31:37.563
Someone's about to lose.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.248
What the hell
is your problem?!

31:56.248 --> 31:57.984
Did that lady
kill my daddy?

31:57.984 --> 31:59.385
Might as well have.

31:59.385 --> 32:01.253
So... she didn't?

32:01.253 --> 32:02.888
Go bug someone else.
I'm on a hunt.

32:02.888 --> 32:05.391
The lady didn't come this way.
Can't you tell?

32:05.391 --> 32:06.592
The grass
would be bent over--

32:06.592 --> 32:08.995
Shut. Up.

32:08.995 --> 32:11.130
Just 'cause Ma tolerates
your feral ass

32:11.130 --> 32:13.065
doesn't mean
the rest of us have to,

32:13.065 --> 32:14.666
now that
your daddy's dead.

32:14.666 --> 32:17.169
Guess
I won't tell you then.

32:18.837 --> 32:20.106
Tell me what?

32:24.343 --> 32:26.979
Thank you.

32:26.979 --> 32:28.981
Can you tell me
where my friend is?

32:29.982 --> 32:31.683
She's in trouble.

32:31.683 --> 32:33.652
Can you take me to her?

32:37.756 --> 32:39.558
Don't think of me
too harshly, Jenny.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.829
I did a lot of bad things
in my life.

32:45.397 --> 32:47.166
But I never stopped
loving you.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.668
Mom, please.
Please don't do this.

32:49.668 --> 32:51.137
Never.

32:53.872 --> 32:55.274
Don't do this.

33:17.029 --> 33:19.165
Stop!
Let 'em go, both of 'em.

33:22.601 --> 33:26.205
- But, Mama--
- Fanny chooses mercy.

33:26.205 --> 33:29.975
And Robbie was her daddy.
You heard me!

33:29.975 --> 33:31.477
Tell them
to walk up the stairs.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.412
Have them ladies
walk up the stairs.

33:33.412 --> 33:34.813
They're free to go.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.515
You can't just
let 'em go!

33:36.515 --> 33:38.750
Don't you argue with me!

33:38.750 --> 33:40.352
I said let them go!

33:40.352 --> 33:42.754
Now, dammit!

33:47.926 --> 33:49.027
Hold still.

33:51.597 --> 33:52.731
Let's go.

33:56.735 --> 33:58.737
Come on.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.946
Go.

34:09.915 --> 34:12.418
They're safe. Move in.

34:12.418 --> 34:13.919
- Police!
- MAN ♪2: Hands up!

34:13.919 --> 34:15.421
Hands in the air! I'll tell
you when to put those down.

34:15.421 --> 34:17.289
Don't move!

34:17.289 --> 34:20.259
It's all right, children.

34:20.259 --> 34:22.228
- Let's go.
- Right this way. Let's go.

34:22.228 --> 34:23.729
It's okay.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.030
Everything's gonna be fine.

34:27.633 --> 34:29.235
Thank you.

34:35.874 --> 34:38.009
I'm really thankful
for you helping us.

34:39.145 --> 34:40.912
Yeah.

34:40.912 --> 34:43.515
What's going on, huh?

34:44.450 --> 34:47.553
I got a bad feeling
about all this.

34:47.553 --> 34:49.421
It's like in Houston
with Randy.

34:49.421 --> 34:51.290
No.
You can't go there.

34:51.290 --> 34:55.060
It's too late.
'Cause it feels the same.

34:55.060 --> 34:56.828
Like something
is-- is comin',

34:56.828 --> 34:58.830
and I'm...

34:58.830 --> 35:01.233
powerless to stop it.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.602
Randy's death
was not your fault.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.305
We both know
that's not true.

35:06.305 --> 35:09.308
He was my partner,
and I let him down.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.109
And then-- then
I wasn't there for you

35:11.109 --> 35:13.179
and I wasn't there
for Emily.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.648
I don't blame you
for leaving me.

35:17.983 --> 35:21.520
Well, you are here
for us now.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.523
That don't make up
for the way I checked out.

35:28.026 --> 35:31.697
I forgive you
for all of that, okay?

35:34.766 --> 35:37.603
And I'm telling you,
this thing with Avery...

35:37.603 --> 35:40.172
this isn't over
by a long shot.

35:41.407 --> 35:43.542
I'm not saying that
to scare you.

35:43.542 --> 35:46.144
- You understand that?
- Okay. Yeah.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.413
But I need you
to know this.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.516
Okay.

35:50.516 --> 35:53.552
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you two.

35:53.552 --> 35:55.654
I know.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.961
God.

36:02.961 --> 36:05.030
I'll always love you.

36:17.476 --> 36:18.844
How did you find him?

36:18.844 --> 36:21.413
Luck and skill.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.014
- Now for the fun part.
- Hm.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.816
Progressive amputation.

36:26.218 --> 36:27.386
Un-gag him.

36:32.358 --> 36:34.593
People will know.

36:34.593 --> 36:37.095
They will know very quickly
that I'm gone,

36:37.095 --> 36:39.598
and you will both
go to jail.

36:39.598 --> 36:43.001
Or the story is that you tried
to steal $15 million

36:43.001 --> 36:45.604
from some very bad people and
you were never heard from again.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.706
I have the $15 million.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.676
That's a nice try.
Only Paige knew the code.

36:50.676 --> 36:52.911
She's an amateur!
Once I had the pages,

36:52.911 --> 36:54.713
I was able to brute-force it.

36:54.713 --> 36:57.048
Right hand or--
hear me out...

36:57.048 --> 36:59.017
...left hand?

36:59.017 --> 37:01.620
You know what, Donno?

37:01.620 --> 37:03.221
Let's hear
what he has to say.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.291
The money's
in a secure account.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.125
If anything happens to me,
if you kill me,

37:07.125 --> 37:08.894
no one gets a bloody thing!

37:08.894 --> 37:12.731
Mouthy.

37:14.300 --> 37:17.936
Okay.
What do you want?

37:17.936 --> 37:21.907
I made a move against your
bosses that went very badly.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.877
And I need protection.

37:25.877 --> 37:27.379
Eight- or four-pound
sledge?

37:27.379 --> 37:29.281
Now, both of them
have their advantages.

37:29.281 --> 37:31.149
Donno.

37:31.149 --> 37:33.118
We're listening now.

37:33.118 --> 37:37.556
I have a plan that could be
very mutually beneficial.

37:37.556 --> 37:40.592
Mm.
And how would that work?

37:40.592 --> 37:45.797
I give you a much larger slice
of the pie...

37:45.797 --> 37:48.334
and you keep me safe.

38:00.245 --> 38:02.280
Good job with
your statement, Mom.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.783
It's gonna help me
make a solid case.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.986
Anything to see those lunatic
murderers get what they deserve.

38:09.855 --> 38:12.691
Now I understand how...

38:12.691 --> 38:15.594
putting bad guys in jail
has some appeal.

38:15.594 --> 38:17.863
Good.

38:17.863 --> 38:20.532
Then you'll understand why
I can't just let you walk away.

38:20.532 --> 38:22.167
You would really
put me in jail

38:22.167 --> 38:24.202
after everything
we just went through?

38:24.202 --> 38:26.204
What we went through
was because of you.

38:27.172 --> 38:29.508
But it did mean
something to me, Mom.

38:29.508 --> 38:30.976
Let's just call it
a start.

38:32.210 --> 38:34.346

the rule of law.

38:34.346 --> 38:36.214
- Sorry.
- Come with me, Ms. Cessna.

38:36.214 --> 38:37.816
Wait. Wait, wait.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.721

38:44.990 --> 38:47.225
