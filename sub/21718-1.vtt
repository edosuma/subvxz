02:00.854 --> 02:03.224
- [Man] I wanna
show you something.

02:03.224 --> 02:06.227
(loud static noise)

02:09.229 --> 02:10.497
- [Newscaster] Unstable,
and on the verge

02:10.497 --> 02:12.032
of a complete meltdown.

02:12.032 --> 02:14.935
That's the word from German
environment Minister Matilda--

02:14.935 --> 02:17.438
- Holy shit, that smells good!

02:22.376 --> 02:23.877
Oh, what happened?

02:23.877 --> 02:25.479
You okay?

02:25.479 --> 02:30.218
- I think it's all right, I
could use a band aid though.

02:30.218 --> 02:33.120
- It looked good, at least.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.889
- I guess we'll just have
to make this salad night.

02:35.889 --> 02:39.427
- You sure, it's not Thursday,
think you can handle it?

02:39.427 --> 02:41.495
- I can improvise.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.732
- Oh chaos, everything
is chaos, I say.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.136
Destruction and flames,
and new torments,

02:49.136 --> 02:52.973
and new tormented
souls I see around me,

02:52.973 --> 02:55.343
wherever I look and
how so ever I turn,

02:55.343 --> 02:56.677
and wherever I gaze.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.511
- Shh.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.747
- What's this?

02:59.747 --> 03:01.782
- Earthquake in Poland,
I guess this nuclear

03:01.782 --> 03:03.584
plant's about to blow.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.253
- Shit, now I feel like an ass.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.720
- As you should.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.155
How was it?

03:08.155 --> 03:09.089
- Huh?

03:09.089 --> 03:09.890
- The lecture, how was it?

03:09.890 --> 03:10.724
- Peruse.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.761
- Very nice, your turn.

03:15.162 --> 03:18.766
- Hmm, it was what it
was, I didn't learn much.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.903
- You don't need
to learn anything,

03:22.903 --> 03:24.972
you know it all all ready.

03:24.972 --> 03:25.806
- Ouch.

03:27.207 --> 03:31.011
- No, oh, shit, that's
not what I mean.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.079
- Uh huh.

03:32.079 --> 03:32.913
- No, really.

03:32.913 --> 03:33.847
- Yup.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.182
- I just mean you're smart.

03:35.182 --> 03:36.317
- Sure.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.150
- That's not what I--

03:37.150 --> 03:38.118
- But that's not what--

03:38.118 --> 03:41.121
- Stop, you know what I meant.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.823
- Tell me again how smart I am.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.057
(laughing)

03:44.057 --> 03:45.259
- While don't you
shut up and grab me

03:45.259 --> 03:47.628
a boiled egg from the
fridge, smart guy.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.563
Do you want an avocado?

03:51.432 --> 03:55.002
- Hey, will you turn
that off for a second.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.006
- What's wrong?

03:59.006 --> 04:02.410
- Nothing, nothing is
wrong, at least I hope not.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.578
All my life, I've looked
at words as though

04:04.578 --> 04:07.180
seeing them for the first time.

04:08.316 --> 04:11.184
I rehearsed this
in my head all day.

04:12.886 --> 04:16.557
Oh, damn it, I had this
all figured out in the car.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.391
Uh, here.

04:28.302 --> 04:32.473
Doubt thou the stars of fire,
doubt that the sun does move,

04:34.608 --> 04:38.779
doubt truth to be a liar,
but never doubt my love.

04:41.181 --> 04:44.184
Calliope Garrard,
will you marry me?

04:50.057 --> 04:52.993
(light soft music)

04:56.864 --> 05:00.968
I know it's not much, I wanted
to get something bigger.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.208
(groaning)

05:15.616 --> 05:18.018
(loud thump)

05:23.857 --> 05:26.460
- [Voiceover] Cali, look at me.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.675
(loud static)

05:41.675 --> 05:42.610
- I'm here.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.953
- Oh, you're awake,
how are we feeling?

05:54.755 --> 05:56.256
- She needs water.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.466
- Looks like we have
had quite a night,

06:05.466 --> 06:07.134
haven't we Calliope?

06:14.442 --> 06:17.945
You wanna tell me
what you remember?

06:17.945 --> 06:20.113
- I just came home.

06:20.113 --> 06:20.948
- Mmm hmm.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.684
- And I cut my finger.

06:26.053 --> 06:26.887
- And?

06:30.891 --> 06:34.962
- Doubt the stars of fire,
did you propose to me?

06:37.297 --> 06:40.200
- So, was it a
stroke or something?

06:41.669 --> 06:43.704
- Well, Calliope experienced
what we call a tonic clonic

06:43.704 --> 06:47.541
event, or what was referred
to as a grand mal seizure

06:47.541 --> 06:49.276
back in the middle ages.

06:49.276 --> 06:50.678
It can be triggered
by a number of things,

06:50.678 --> 06:53.847
stress, malnutrition,
flashing lights,

06:55.516 --> 06:59.520
were you watching television
when this happened?

07:01.522 --> 07:02.422
- Uh, yeah.

07:04.592 --> 07:07.928
- Yeah, okay, tell me,
can you remember having

07:07.928 --> 07:11.098
any strange feelings
the moments preceding?

07:11.098 --> 07:15.002
Dizziness maybe, or a
strong surge of emotions,

07:16.369 --> 07:19.540
altered vision,
hearing, strange smells,

07:19.540 --> 07:23.744
overwhelming sense of deja
vu, anything like that?

07:23.744 --> 07:25.312
- I don't remember.

07:26.880 --> 07:31.051
- Okay, well the seizure
appears to have been idiopathic.

07:32.486 --> 07:33.721
- What does that mean?

07:33.721 --> 07:35.989
- It's a fancy word
for we don't know.

07:35.989 --> 07:39.660
Now, is this the first
time it's happened to you?

07:39.660 --> 07:40.661
- I don't...

07:47.367 --> 07:51.539
I think, when I lived with
Billy, or maybe before.

07:55.543 --> 07:56.476
- Billy?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.712
- And how long ago was that?

08:00.180 --> 08:03.551
- I don't know, maybe
10 years ago, nine.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.019
- Who's Billy?

08:06.019 --> 08:09.022
- [Doctor] Was it
just the one time?

08:11.258 --> 08:12.693
- I was eighteen.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.698
I don't, I don't...

08:19.867 --> 08:23.303
- Okay, well listen,
I want you to relax,

08:25.272 --> 08:27.374
I'm gonna come back in and
check on you in a little bit.

08:27.374 --> 08:30.644
We're gonna keep you overnight
and run some tests, okay?

08:30.644 --> 08:31.712
- Sure, okay.

08:43.756 --> 08:44.925
- Who's Billy?

08:46.393 --> 08:50.898
- [Man] Hey, you wanna know
why they call me dead Billy?

08:50.898 --> 08:53.466
(loud buzzing)

08:56.737 --> 09:00.708
It was '67, '68 maybe,
before the Ted offensive.

09:02.075 --> 09:05.412
They sent us into this
village, north of (mumbles).

09:05.412 --> 09:07.447
Everyone there was
Cong, they said.

09:07.447 --> 09:11.018
There was this black guy,
called him big Charles,

09:11.018 --> 09:14.121
huge motherfucker, but
a sweetheart, you know.

09:14.121 --> 09:18.291
Big Charles sees this
girl, maybe seven or eight,

09:18.291 --> 09:21.028
sitting in a road, out
in front of the huts.

09:21.028 --> 09:25.198
She's crying, he has a candy
bar or something in his pack,

09:26.366 --> 09:27.868
so he goes to her, to
give her the candy,

09:27.868 --> 09:30.904
and she jumps up, throws
something, grenade maybe,

09:30.904 --> 09:33.907
something, and Big Charles
catches it one handed,

09:33.907 --> 09:35.342
and turns his big
dumb eyes to me,

09:35.342 --> 09:37.645
and next thing I
know I'm on my back,

09:37.645 --> 09:39.747
wearing his guts as
a fucking necklace.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.783
I was standing five,
10 feet away maybe,

09:42.783 --> 09:44.317
and I didn't have
a scratch on me.

09:44.317 --> 09:47.387
So everyone says later,
Jesus Christ Billy,

09:47.387 --> 09:51.191
you should have been
fucking dead, right?

09:51.191 --> 09:54.127
And I should have been,
I mean, I know that,

09:54.127 --> 09:56.830
but I didn't even singe
my God damn eyebrows.

09:56.830 --> 10:00.033
So about a month later, we're
in this little bar in Saigon,

10:00.033 --> 10:03.203
and this guy Norman,
big Navajo guy,

10:03.203 --> 10:05.338
he's trying to get me
laid, all those guys,

10:05.338 --> 10:07.975
they thought I was a virgin.

10:07.975 --> 10:11.478
Norm decides he can't
have that in his unit,

10:11.478 --> 10:14.815
so he's talking to
this slope whore,

10:14.815 --> 10:17.651
but she don't speak English,
it's all just GI, GI,

10:17.651 --> 10:20.988
blowie, blowie, fuckie,
fuckie, that sort of thing,

10:20.988 --> 10:24.391
so he's telling her this story
about how I should be dead,

10:24.391 --> 10:27.560
and she lights all up
like a Christmas tree,

10:27.560 --> 10:29.863
because yeah, she
knows that word, dead.

10:29.863 --> 10:33.600
So, she just looks at
me with these big eyes,

10:33.600 --> 10:37.470
and she just shrugs
and says, "Blowie?"

10:37.470 --> 10:39.840
He gives her five bucks, he
takes to me this little room

10:39.840 --> 10:41.608
in the back, and sucks me off.

10:41.608 --> 10:44.544
Took me thirty seconds,
but I swear I damn near

10:44.544 --> 10:48.048
blew a hole in the
back of her skull.

10:48.048 --> 10:51.384
Anyway, I've been
Dead Billy ever since.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.956
(thundering and rain)

11:14.307 --> 11:15.809
(loud knocking)

11:15.809 --> 11:17.544
- Cali, come on, this isn't
funny, just open the door,

11:17.544 --> 11:19.479
I know you're in there.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.685
Cali, I just wanna see
you, open the door!

11:28.388 --> 11:32.225
Come on, I'm gonna stay
here all day, until...

11:34.127 --> 11:35.695
Oh God, what did you
let him do to you.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.997
(door slamming)

11:36.997 --> 11:38.531
- I told you I ran away
from home for a while,

11:38.531 --> 11:40.000
when I was a kid.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.603
- Yeah, but you never
mentioned this Billy.

11:45.739 --> 11:46.673
Who was he?

11:48.976 --> 11:50.878
- Just this guy, a vet.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.115
- [Man] From the Gulf?

11:56.649 --> 11:57.484
- Vietnam.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.486
- Jesus, how old was he?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.622
And you lived with him?

12:05.192 --> 12:07.694
Was it, was it a sexual thing?

12:09.496 --> 12:10.697
- Roy--

12:10.697 --> 12:11.498
- Come on, were you
fucking the guy?

12:11.498 --> 12:13.133
- What do you think?

12:18.371 --> 12:21.809
I don't think I need
to apologize to you.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.980
- [Man 1] Are you okay?

13:27.340 --> 13:30.610
(sorrowful slow music)

16:28.355 --> 16:29.856
(loud squeaking noise)

16:29.856 --> 16:31.958
- [Newscaster] Developing in
Germany, showing a frightening

16:31.958 --> 16:34.527
new discovery at the
Kumps Nuclear Plant,

16:34.527 --> 16:36.596
just days after the
earthquake in Poland

16:36.596 --> 16:39.866
sent the reactor into
complete meltdown.

16:39.866 --> 16:42.769
German officials have now
released data that shows

16:42.769 --> 16:45.672
radiation levels around
Kunps have spiked

16:45.672 --> 16:48.808
to levels much higher than
initial reports suggested.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.911
Reports from both the German
environmental authorities,

16:51.911 --> 16:55.248
and the UN health
organization, show that total

16:55.248 --> 16:58.818
air release of iodine
131 and cecil 137...

16:58.818 --> 17:00.787
- [Man] Hey, look at me.

17:11.731 --> 17:14.401
(alarm beeping)

18:09.156 --> 18:11.824
- Well, this is kinda fucked up.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.695
- There's nothing to
discourage the appetite

18:15.695 --> 18:18.465
for divinity in
the heart of man.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.968
That's Kabu, my dear.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.236
- [Female] Lucian.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.070
- Hmm?

18:27.607 --> 18:31.778
Muse, I thought you were
staying with your mother.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.150
- It's Tuesday, Daddy.

18:41.588 --> 18:42.755
- Well then...

18:44.224 --> 18:46.125
Well sit Muse, join us.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.968
Would you like some coffee?

18:55.968 --> 18:58.070
- I don't know, I
should get to school.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.406
- Nonsense, sit.

19:16.623 --> 19:20.893
Cali, this is Ashley,
she's my graduate student.

19:20.893 --> 19:21.894
- Hey, sure.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.831
I gotta get to class.

19:24.831 --> 19:25.665
- Sit!

19:30.102 --> 19:30.937
- Okay.

19:34.006 --> 19:37.677
- Ashley, this is my
daughter Cali, my muse.

19:46.553 --> 19:50.723
Ashley is quite the star in
our humble little bailiwick.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.894
She's doing her thesis
on the age of reason,

19:54.894 --> 19:56.829
very provocative stuff.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.637
- I'm doing this third
way feminist view of it.

20:04.637 --> 20:07.907
You know, breaking
down the relationship

20:07.907 --> 20:09.709
between the mostly
male existentialist--

20:09.709 --> 20:11.711
- I'm sorry but
this is bullshit.

20:11.711 --> 20:12.912
- [Father] Cali.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.415
- Not your thesis,
sorry, it sounds very,

20:15.415 --> 20:18.585
you know, interesting,
or whatever, I gotta go.

20:18.585 --> 20:21.921
- Cali, I'm afraid
you're being a child.

20:28.094 --> 20:31.764
- Don't feel bad, I
know he's very charming.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.207
(low dark music)

20:50.817 --> 20:53.386
(birds cawing)

21:03.062 --> 21:06.566
- You buy it, or you
stop playing with it.

22:00.787 --> 22:04.957
- You wouldn't like it, it's
all full of words and stuff.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.627
- Made of Athens
air we part, give,

22:07.627 --> 22:09.796
oh, give me back my heart.

22:10.997 --> 22:11.931
It's Byron.

22:14.367 --> 22:17.303
- Good for you,
you're a smart one.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.544
This lad was known as
Nicholas the Galant,

22:25.678 --> 22:28.748
making love in secret
was his talent.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.321
That's Trosser.

22:37.289 --> 22:40.059
So how does a useless
truant like you quote Byron,

22:40.059 --> 22:41.461
what's your deal?

22:42.862 --> 22:46.298
- Like you said,
I'm a smart one.

22:46.298 --> 22:47.900
- Yeah, I can tell.

22:49.669 --> 22:50.837
You know, I ain't your daddy,

22:50.837 --> 22:54.541
but aren't you supposed
to be in school?

22:54.541 --> 22:55.842
- I'll go when they
can teach me something

22:55.842 --> 22:57.544
they haven't learned
in their ignominious

22:57.544 --> 22:59.679
little community
college educations.

22:59.679 --> 23:01.881
(laughing)

23:06.152 --> 23:08.821
- Jesus Christ, how old are you?

23:11.958 --> 23:12.792
- 18.

23:15.928 --> 23:18.164
- Uh huh, what's your name?

23:20.767 --> 23:23.035
- What do you care?

23:23.035 --> 23:24.604
- What's your name?

23:29.909 --> 23:34.080
- Cali, Calliope really, but
only my dad calls me that.

23:37.283 --> 23:41.220
- It's kind of a faggy
name, is your daddy a fag.

23:41.220 --> 23:44.290
- (laughing) Hardly.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.460
- Calliope, the muse.

23:52.398 --> 23:55.802
- Yeah, he's the only one
who calls me that too.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.704
- Ah, I get it, issues.

24:02.975 --> 24:03.810
Here.

24:19.659 --> 24:22.495
Take it, it will
make daddy happy.

24:24.831 --> 24:27.266
- I don't have issues.

24:27.266 --> 24:29.802
- We all have issues, sweetie.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.470
- So what are yours?

24:34.707 --> 24:36.208
- What do you think?

24:36.208 --> 24:38.911
- You're like a vet, right?

24:38.911 --> 24:42.381
So you've probably
killed people.

24:42.381 --> 24:45.451
- That's none of your business.

24:45.451 --> 24:48.855
- I'm sorry, I thought we
were talking about issues.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.758
- You don't back off, do you?

24:51.758 --> 24:52.592
- Nope.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.968
- I'm Billy, yeah,
I killed people.

25:11.010 --> 25:11.944
- How many?

25:19.652 --> 25:21.153
- I like you Cali.

25:25.725 --> 25:29.896
- I don't believe you, I don't
think you killed anybody.

26:01.360 --> 26:05.531
- Stop by the next time you
want to escape the ignominy.

26:20.179 --> 26:21.013
See ya.

26:32.124 --> 26:35.127
(television static)

27:16.102 --> 27:19.171
(low dramatic music)

28:16.528 --> 28:18.765
(coughing)

28:35.948 --> 28:38.350
So what you doing here, Cali?

28:41.821 --> 28:45.257
- Was that you playing,
when I walked up?

28:55.768 --> 28:59.005
(light guitar playing)

29:07.179 --> 29:09.816
(fast rock music)

29:09.816 --> 29:12.651
(camera snapping)

29:14.954 --> 29:19.125
- [Man] You ain't 18, ain't
no fucking way you're 18.

29:20.726 --> 29:23.896
(men talking quietly)

29:28.767 --> 29:32.038
Hey Billy, ain't no
fucking way she 18.

29:39.145 --> 29:41.613
- Mind your business.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.883
Anyway, ever tell you
guys the story about

29:43.883 --> 29:45.351
how I got the name Dead Billy?

29:45.351 --> 29:50.222
- Only everyday Bill, it's
different every God damn time.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.791
(men laughing)

29:54.393 --> 29:58.397
(light guitar strumming)

29:58.397 --> 30:01.800
- Ah, I'm not very
good, but I like the--

30:08.074 --> 30:10.910
(fast rock music)

30:15.614 --> 30:19.785
- [Man] Need any help girl,
just call, let me know.

30:38.370 --> 30:41.807
- I think maybe, this
isn't a great idea.

30:46.012 --> 30:48.747
I'm old enough to
be your father.

30:50.816 --> 30:52.418
- But you're not...

30:55.421 --> 30:56.255
My father.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.863
- Hey, look at me.

31:07.766 --> 31:08.767
You're sure?

31:09.969 --> 31:10.802
- Yeah.

31:19.111 --> 31:20.446
But I better go.

31:39.498 --> 31:43.669
- So, I told them that the play
was about a rabid populous.

31:45.137 --> 31:49.308
And they looked at me with
these longing, willful,

31:49.308 --> 31:52.844
naive stares that only a
college freshman could have,

31:52.844 --> 31:55.747
hoping that I was not
writing another tirade

31:55.747 --> 31:58.184
about an impotent generation.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.087
And of course I told them I was.

32:01.087 --> 32:03.155
(laughing)

32:03.155 --> 32:06.725
Their heads dropped,
it was cute, in a way.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.606
Your shirt's inside out, yup.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.687
- Where were you?

32:41.193 --> 32:45.031
You are not going to
drink out of that carton.

32:48.967 --> 32:52.304
Still haven't
answered my question.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.006
- I was at dads.

32:54.006 --> 32:56.175
- Uh huh, and how was dad?

33:12.058 --> 33:14.560
- What is that, what the fuck.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.268
(knocking)

33:25.571 --> 33:28.574
Holy shit, uh Jesus
Christ, come in.

33:34.280 --> 33:35.681
Shit, sorry, sit.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.122
Jesus, how are you Cali?

33:44.790 --> 33:45.724
- I'm good.

33:48.827 --> 33:51.930
- Oh, congratulations,
who's the guy.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.800
- His name is Roy.

33:54.800 --> 33:58.870
- Good name, a grown up name,
if you know what I mean.

34:01.673 --> 34:05.444
What does he do, where did you
meet him, tell me everything?

34:05.444 --> 34:07.813
- Okay, let's see,
he's a post grad,

34:07.813 --> 34:10.416
at the University,
comparative lit.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.451
- Sounds fancy.

34:12.451 --> 34:16.288
- Well, we met at a
lecture, he was...

34:16.288 --> 34:20.058
Geez, this sounds
horrible, but he was my TA.

34:24.696 --> 34:27.166
- So you're still
going to school?

34:27.166 --> 34:28.833
- Got my bachelors last fall,

34:28.833 --> 34:31.170
and I just started
the masters program.

34:31.170 --> 34:32.638
- Comparatives, what's it--

34:32.638 --> 34:34.840
- [Cali] English education.

34:34.840 --> 34:38.677
- That's great,
really, that's great.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.011
I knew as you soon
as you got your GED,

34:40.011 --> 34:43.014
everything would fall
in place for you.

34:43.014 --> 34:45.417
Seriously, the best congrats.

34:46.952 --> 34:47.786
- Thanks.

34:49.188 --> 34:50.389
(phone ringing)

34:50.389 --> 34:52.458
- So, what brings you by?

34:58.130 --> 35:00.966
- I was, you're
going to hate this.

35:07.839 --> 35:09.107
- Fuck.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.242
- [Cali] Selena...

35:10.242 --> 35:11.076
- No Cali.

35:16.014 --> 35:17.749
Calliope, look at me.

35:19.585 --> 35:23.422
This isn't some bullshit
about closure, is it?

35:26.558 --> 35:29.961
- I've been having
seizures again.

35:29.961 --> 35:34.466
- Oh, geez, okay Calliope,
you don't need to be talking

35:34.466 --> 35:35.701
to me, you need to--

35:35.701 --> 35:36.968
- No, I've all ready
been to a doctor,

35:36.968 --> 35:38.970
that's not why I'm here.

35:41.740 --> 35:42.574
Okay, um.

35:47.746 --> 35:49.248
You see it, right?

35:50.316 --> 35:52.418
- Of course I do, what...

35:54.119 --> 35:55.687
- You see that, right?

35:55.687 --> 35:57.155
- Yeah, but--

35:57.155 --> 35:58.657
- What do you see?

36:01.327 --> 36:04.930
Please, Selena, I'm
just trying to explain.

36:07.032 --> 36:11.036
- I see, well, a little
statue of, I don't know,

36:14.873 --> 36:17.108
is it Athena, or something?

36:18.810 --> 36:20.579
- Calliope, the muse.

36:25.484 --> 36:27.986
- Okay, Calliope, and a glass.

36:33.325 --> 36:35.461
- [Cali] What
color is the glass?

36:35.461 --> 36:36.295
- This is--

36:36.295 --> 36:37.496
- Please.

36:37.496 --> 36:38.897
- It's amber, okay,
now you have to

36:38.897 --> 36:42.033
tell me what this is all about.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.370
- Billy gave me that statue,

36:45.737 --> 36:49.140
and that glass is
from his house.

36:49.140 --> 36:50.309
When you got me out of there,

36:50.309 --> 36:52.210
I didn't take anything
with me, did I?

36:52.210 --> 36:53.879
- No, of course not.

36:59.385 --> 37:01.987
- I just found this at my house.

37:06.958 --> 37:09.295
And that, is that a seizure.

37:15.267 --> 37:19.438
I was hoping, I thought maybe
you could tell me where he is.

37:24.276 --> 37:25.677
- Absolutely not.

37:27.446 --> 37:30.081
No way in hell,
Jesus Christ Cali,

37:30.081 --> 37:32.984
you were like my
one success story.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.787
Do you remember what you were

37:35.787 --> 37:37.289
like when you got out of there?

37:37.289 --> 37:41.026
I do, 80 pounds, at most,
somebody would slam a door,

37:41.026 --> 37:42.594
you'd nearly jump
out of your skin.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.763
You remember that, do you?

37:45.964 --> 37:46.898
Look at me.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.707
Calliope, stop!

38:01.246 --> 38:02.080
Why?

38:03.515 --> 38:07.386
- I don't want to talk to
him Selena, or see him.

38:11.790 --> 38:14.460
I just need to know where he is.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.497
- I don't believe you.

38:19.931 --> 38:23.669
I've seen this way too
many times before, no.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.237
I'm sorry, but no.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.319
Cali, wait.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.589
- [Billy] I wanna
show you something.

38:43.589 --> 38:44.690
- Okay, what?

39:06.344 --> 39:07.746
- You feeling it?

39:08.614 --> 39:11.383
(light slapping)

39:19.224 --> 39:23.228
40 seconds, maybe less,
that's all you got baby.

39:24.430 --> 39:27.666
You right with God
and everything, hmm?

39:29.535 --> 39:31.603
You're seeing spots, hmm?

39:33.739 --> 39:36.875
Tiny little explosions
like firecrackers,

39:36.875 --> 39:40.345
way in the back of your corneas,

39:40.345 --> 39:44.082
visions narrowing down,
tiny little pinprick.

39:47.152 --> 39:49.588
Want me to countdown for you?

39:50.922 --> 39:53.191
30, 29, 28, 27, 26, enough?

39:58.196 --> 40:00.799
(loud gasping)

40:18.349 --> 40:20.786
That's what it's like to die.

40:40.105 --> 40:42.373
That guy, Starkey's friend,

40:44.209 --> 40:48.379
that dude you were talking to
at the VFW, what was his name?

40:52.784 --> 40:55.353
His name Calliope, what was it?

40:57.222 --> 40:59.224
- I don't, I don't know.

41:08.099 --> 41:09.200
- I think he liked you.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.870
(light sobbing)

41:17.509 --> 41:20.846
You can go out with
him, if you want to.

41:22.614 --> 41:25.116
I mean, if you really want to.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.774
(loud thump)

41:54.245 --> 41:56.915
(phone ringing)

42:01.119 --> 42:02.520
- Hello.

42:02.520 --> 42:03.989
- [Roy] Hey, I was
thinking about stopping by

42:03.989 --> 42:06.892
that new vegan thai place on
my way home, you want anything?

42:06.892 --> 42:08.326
- Yeah, pad thai.

42:09.661 --> 42:12.931
- [Roy] Tofu, egg
noodles, right?

42:12.931 --> 42:14.199
- Yeah.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.568
- [Roy] And a ton of
hot stuff, I got it.

42:16.568 --> 42:17.636
(loud thump)

42:17.636 --> 42:19.738
You want a thai iced tea?

42:21.406 --> 42:22.574
Hey, you okay?

42:24.610 --> 42:28.680
- Um, no, just banged my
elbow on the gear shift.

42:32.083 --> 42:34.319
No iced tea, thanks though.

42:36.421 --> 42:39.157
- [Roy] Okay, you home?

42:39.157 --> 42:41.459
- I'll be home in
a few, I'm just out

42:41.459 --> 42:43.561
running a couple errands.

42:43.561 --> 42:45.997
- [Roy] You doing okay?

42:45.997 --> 42:47.098
- Yeah, yeah, just--

42:47.098 --> 42:49.134
(loud thump)

42:49.134 --> 42:49.968
Um, shit.

42:51.169 --> 42:52.738
- [Roy] You okay?

42:52.738 --> 42:56.341
- No, the batteries crapping
out, I'll see you in a bit.

42:56.341 --> 42:57.843
- [Roy] Mmm, okay.

43:16.662 --> 43:18.897
(knocking)

43:27.973 --> 43:32.143
- There's nothing I can
say to stop you, is there?

43:36.314 --> 43:40.218
And you know that this
is really stupid, right?

43:43.421 --> 43:46.257
I don't know where
he is, after...

43:50.361 --> 43:54.199
You know, he just sort
of dropped off our radar.

43:54.199 --> 43:56.868
You'll have to trust me on that.

43:57.803 --> 43:58.636
- Okay.

44:09.614 --> 44:13.618
- You need to know that
this could get me fired.

44:25.864 --> 44:30.035
Alissa Kononen, she's a stand
up comic out of Brooklyn.

44:31.202 --> 44:34.239
After you left, I
did a quick search.

44:34.239 --> 44:37.743
She's on the road right
now, she's doing clubs

44:37.743 --> 44:39.677
all across the country.

44:41.112 --> 44:43.915
I don't have her number, but
if you're up for a drive,

44:43.915 --> 44:48.386
she's performing down in
the Springs, this Saturday.

44:48.386 --> 44:51.823
Maybe you could catch
her after the show.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.962
She's his daughter.

45:03.434 --> 45:07.105
Calliope, this cannot
come back on me, okay?

45:12.543 --> 45:13.544
- Of course.

45:19.050 --> 45:21.052
- Take care of yourself.

45:29.795 --> 45:32.463
(train horn whistling)

45:32.463 --> 45:34.132
- Yeah, okay, I get.

45:37.168 --> 45:39.004
No, I understand, I...

45:41.306 --> 45:42.640
I do Kay, but...

45:47.245 --> 45:50.515
Can't you just put
her on the pho...

45:50.515 --> 45:54.619
All right, well at least
tell her happy birthday.

46:25.783 --> 46:26.617
- Morning.

46:32.858 --> 46:34.860
- [Cali] Is it epilepsy?

46:36.327 --> 46:39.697
- Epilepsy's a fairly useless
term, but no I don't think so.

46:39.697 --> 46:40.598
Looky here.

46:42.033 --> 46:45.136
Not a tumor, don't worry, it
appears to be a small lesion,

46:45.136 --> 46:47.973
about the size of
your pinky nail.

46:49.374 --> 46:53.211
And it appears to have
been there for some time.

46:54.712 --> 46:58.183
Tell me, Calliope, have
you been seeing things,

46:58.183 --> 47:01.519
or hearing voices, or
anything like that?

47:04.089 --> 47:06.057
You know, there's no
percentage in not being

47:06.057 --> 47:08.393
honest about this, Calliope.

47:12.197 --> 47:15.133
Okay, well first
thing, no more TV.

47:16.434 --> 47:19.337
Not until we get
this taken care of.

47:19.337 --> 47:21.239
- What are the options?

47:22.908 --> 47:27.078
- Well, considering the
seizures and hallucinations,

47:28.446 --> 47:30.548
and whatnot, I'd say
we're pretty well past the

47:30.548 --> 47:32.150
wait and see stage.

47:32.150 --> 47:34.986
Now, I doubt this is
cancer, but we'll need to do

47:34.986 --> 47:37.722
a biopsy to rule it out.

47:37.722 --> 47:39.991
In the meantime, no
TV, try not to drive,

47:39.991 --> 47:43.061
blah, blah, blah,
you know the drill.

47:51.702 --> 47:54.705
Don't worry, this is nothing.

47:54.705 --> 47:57.642
It's a little pit
stop, that's all.

47:58.876 --> 48:01.146
Congratulations, by the way.

48:18.163 --> 48:19.430
- It's okay Billy.

48:19.430 --> 48:21.799
- What the fuck do
you know about it?

48:21.799 --> 48:24.035
Shit, fuck, I'm sorry Cali.

48:26.237 --> 48:27.172
I love you.

48:31.042 --> 48:33.278
(gurgling)

49:00.238 --> 49:03.374
- We have rotted wood all
underneath the sink here.

49:03.374 --> 49:04.642
- I found this.

49:08.113 --> 49:10.715
Under the bed, Billy drew this?

49:15.453 --> 49:16.287
- No.

49:21.926 --> 49:23.861
That was somebody else.

49:25.630 --> 49:29.034
- Calliope, you
need to talk to me.

49:29.034 --> 49:30.568
- Roy, not right now.

49:30.568 --> 49:33.071
- No, I've had enough of this.

49:34.639 --> 49:37.575
Do you understand
what this is like?

49:37.575 --> 49:39.777
Do you get it, at all?

49:39.777 --> 49:42.080
I'm trying so hard, Cali,

49:42.080 --> 49:44.315
to not think you're
just a fucking liar,

49:44.315 --> 49:47.085
and everything you've
told me about yourself is

49:47.085 --> 49:49.954
a fucking lie, and the life
we've been building together,

49:49.954 --> 49:50.955
is a fucking lie.

49:50.955 --> 49:51.889
- Roy--

49:51.889 --> 49:53.991
- Are you a fucking liar, Cali?

49:53.991 --> 49:54.925
Talk to me!

49:54.925 --> 49:56.927
- Roy, you're hurting me!

50:01.399 --> 50:03.468
- Calliope, fuck, I am...

50:07.838 --> 50:11.276
- It's your birthday
next month, 18, wow.

50:12.843 --> 50:15.913
We should do something,
have a party.

50:17.915 --> 50:20.251
Oh wait I forgot,
that will never work,

50:20.251 --> 50:22.487
you don't have any friends.

50:24.522 --> 50:26.023
- Mom.

50:26.023 --> 50:28.626
- You know, in a month,
you're gonna be an adult,

50:28.626 --> 50:30.328
and then you can do
whatever the hell you want,

50:30.328 --> 50:32.563
but while you're
here, in my house--

50:32.563 --> 50:33.764
- Mom.

50:33.764 --> 50:34.432
- [Mother] You
will do exactly...

50:34.432 --> 50:35.800
- Just stop it.

50:35.800 --> 50:36.634
- What?

50:38.103 --> 50:41.672
- Just stop with the whole
concerned parent thing.

50:41.672 --> 50:43.841
You don't do it very well.

50:48.913 --> 50:51.282
- You're really something else,

50:51.282 --> 50:52.583
after everything I have done--

50:52.583 --> 50:54.985
(loud thump)

50:56.521 --> 50:59.390
You wanna go back to him?

50:59.390 --> 51:00.558
- Dad?

51:00.558 --> 51:03.128
- You know who I
mean, where were you?

51:03.128 --> 51:04.229
- I told you.

51:06.631 --> 51:10.201
- Yeah, your dads,
should I call him?

51:10.201 --> 51:13.104
(low solemn music)

51:17.242 --> 51:18.075
- Oh, I don't think I'm
supposed to have any of that.

51:18.075 --> 51:19.510
- I made it weak.

51:35.260 --> 51:37.262
So, tell me about Billy.

51:53.311 --> 51:55.546
- She was gorgeous, I mean,

51:57.148 --> 52:00.385
not movie gorgeous
or anything, just...

52:02.753 --> 52:04.489
First thing I thought
when I saw her,

52:04.489 --> 52:07.892
was how tired she was,
that nobody that young

52:07.892 --> 52:09.960
should be so God damn tired.

52:09.960 --> 52:12.963
She had these deep sunk
eyes, that just dug in

52:12.963 --> 52:16.634
like corkscrews, and
this thin little mouth,

52:18.469 --> 52:22.407
that I thought, I don't
know, I kind of thought,

52:22.407 --> 52:24.242
I just wanted to kiss.

52:25.810 --> 52:28.179
I always wanna fuck the
girls when I see them.

52:28.179 --> 52:30.181
I can't seem to help it.

52:31.682 --> 52:35.019
My eyes are words
straight to my prick,

52:35.019 --> 52:37.555
doesn't matter who they are.

52:37.555 --> 52:39.156
The first thing I think
when I see them is

52:39.156 --> 52:44.161
how I wanna get them naked,
I wanna get them under me.

52:44.161 --> 52:47.598
And I wanna fuck the God
damn shit out of them.

52:47.598 --> 52:50.100
But with her, all I wanted is,

52:52.470 --> 52:55.740
I just kind of wanted that kiss.

52:55.740 --> 52:58.175
All I thought about for days.

52:59.377 --> 53:02.880
I should've left
it there, I guess.

53:02.880 --> 53:05.783
I thought she could
make me normal,

53:06.951 --> 53:08.619
I've never been with
a normal girl before,

53:08.619 --> 53:12.390
but I thought, I don't
know, maybe she could do it.

53:12.390 --> 53:14.892
Maybe I could love her normal.

53:16.427 --> 53:19.464
And then when she was gone,

53:19.464 --> 53:24.001
I felt like my chest
was this big black cave.

53:24.001 --> 53:28.205
I was 17 God damn years old,
and I felt like it was over.

53:28.205 --> 53:29.139
I was dead.

53:32.042 --> 53:35.079
I guess maybe that's why
they call me Dead Billy.

53:35.079 --> 53:37.415
I know what you're thinking,

53:38.816 --> 53:42.653
I know what you wanna
do, don't think I don't.

53:46.891 --> 53:49.260
It's okay, you know.

53:49.260 --> 53:50.595
Hey, look at me.

54:01.171 --> 54:02.006
It's okay.

54:17.688 --> 54:18.889
(quiet sizzling)

54:18.889 --> 54:21.626
It's okay Cali, it's
okay, it's okay.

54:28.366 --> 54:30.134
It's okay, it's okay.

54:39.009 --> 54:41.178
- [Roy] How long were you?

54:42.913 --> 54:44.515
- I don't remember.

54:56.093 --> 54:59.664
- Come on, I'm not
paying by the hour here.

55:07.137 --> 55:10.541
- A long time, I think
they took me away.

55:12.710 --> 55:14.311
- Who?

55:14.311 --> 55:16.481
- A social worker, my mom.

55:21.218 --> 55:24.389
I think I was 17
when they got me out.

55:25.823 --> 55:29.059
- You know it wasn't
your fault, right?

55:31.929 --> 55:34.432
Calliope, you were just a kid.

55:37.001 --> 55:38.769
It wasn't your fault.

55:40.871 --> 55:44.041
(low sorrowful music)

55:53.083 --> 55:54.619
- You're lovely.

55:54.619 --> 55:55.786
- Calliope.

55:55.786 --> 55:57.121
- Roy, listen...

56:01.726 --> 56:02.827
Listen to me.

56:07.965 --> 56:09.700
I wanted to be there.

56:14.872 --> 56:17.775
I'm not exactly
who you think I am.

56:17.775 --> 56:20.778
- Please, don't do
this, I love you.

56:26.484 --> 56:27.918
- I love you too.

56:33.190 --> 56:35.593
- So, what about the drawing?

56:37.027 --> 56:37.928
- It doesn't matter.

56:37.928 --> 56:38.863
- Calliope!

56:38.863 --> 56:41.365
- Look, I have to go somewhere,

56:47.772 --> 56:49.440
to talk to somebody.

56:50.575 --> 56:51.408
- Him?

56:54.779 --> 56:57.615
- I don't know,
maybe, I hope not.

57:00.885 --> 57:02.720
- I wanna go with you.

57:07.792 --> 57:09.393
- I'm sorry.

57:09.393 --> 57:11.562
- I don't understand this.

57:12.897 --> 57:14.131
Do you still...

57:18.669 --> 57:20.505
Do you still want him?

57:40.558 --> 57:44.194
- I want the best environment
for her too, I do.

57:44.194 --> 57:47.665
What am I doing, how
do you know that?

57:47.665 --> 57:50.234
That's what I used to do Kay,
I'm trying to be a father now,

57:50.234 --> 57:53.137
I'm trying to be a
member of a family,

57:53.137 --> 57:54.972
and that's what you said--

57:54.972 --> 57:56.541
- Bill, you better get
your ass in here before--

57:56.541 --> 57:57.875
- That's all you talk about now.

57:57.875 --> 58:00.210
I want to, I'd learned that.

58:02.547 --> 58:05.382
No, that's what this is, I
know that, I know the legal.

58:05.382 --> 58:08.886
God damn it Kay, she's
my fucking kid too.

58:13.858 --> 58:18.028
Yeah, well, I'm not the one
who's being a cunt about it!

58:19.429 --> 58:23.167
- Gotta listen to him shout
like that all the time?

58:26.170 --> 58:30.340
- Don't fucking bogart,
okay, this shit ain't cheap!

58:36.747 --> 58:37.582
- Billy?

58:39.149 --> 58:41.652
- You having a flashback Bill?

58:57.201 --> 58:58.035
- Billy.

59:00.971 --> 59:02.406
- Don't!

59:02.406 --> 59:05.075
(light gasping)

59:26.496 --> 59:28.332
(laughing)

59:28.332 --> 59:29.166
- Get out!

59:30.500 --> 59:33.671
(exciting rock music)

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.362
(static noise)

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:38.903
- [Billy] Look at me.

01:00:54.685 --> 01:00:56.086
Cali, look at me.

01:01:04.862 --> 01:01:07.197
- [Roy] What about your mom?

01:01:12.302 --> 01:01:17.141
I got room, you know, if
you need a place, anything,

01:01:17.141 --> 01:01:19.877
you know, no
strings, or nothing.

01:01:21.278 --> 01:01:23.113
- I don't know, maybe.

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:29.419
- [Roy] I'd really
like to draw you.

01:01:31.989 --> 01:01:35.059
(laughing)

01:01:35.059 --> 01:01:36.460
What, I can draw.

01:02:53.403 --> 01:02:54.238
- Billy?

01:03:12.256 --> 01:03:14.324
- I'm sorry I scared you.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.395
- It's okay, what happened?

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.202
What did she say to you?

01:03:25.202 --> 01:03:26.871
- Don't leave, okay?

01:03:29.339 --> 01:03:30.174
- What?

01:03:34.778 --> 01:03:37.514
- You can kill me
if you want to,

01:03:39.183 --> 01:03:43.353
slit my throat in my sleep or
something, just don't leave.

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:49.894
- I'm not going to
kill you Billy, Jesus.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.670
And I'm not going anywhere,
you're stuck with me.

01:04:06.543 --> 01:04:10.480
- Lovers and mad men have
such seething brains.

01:04:18.255 --> 01:04:21.591
- Such shaping fantasies
that apprehend,

01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:26.430
more than quarries,
it never comprehends.

01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:35.906
- I live in this neighborhood,
and on the side of my house,

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:37.774
is all these Morning Glories.

01:04:37.774 --> 01:04:40.477
Which is awesome, if you go
running at 7:00 in the morning,

01:04:40.477 --> 01:04:43.747
I don't, but if you
did, you would see...

01:04:43.747 --> 01:04:46.516
(scraping noise)

01:04:47.918 --> 01:04:50.254
The morning glories
were just out,

01:04:50.254 --> 01:04:52.156
like they haven't gotten
used to the weather.

01:04:52.156 --> 01:04:53.490
- What you want?

01:04:56.426 --> 01:04:59.396
- It's a two drink
minimum, lady.

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:01.498
- A glass of zen, I guess.

01:05:04.068 --> 01:05:05.302
(audience laughing)

01:05:05.302 --> 01:05:06.736
- All right guys, we
got a lot of show.

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.338
I'm Sarah Katie,
thank you very much.

01:05:08.338 --> 01:05:11.341
(audience clapping)

01:05:19.149 --> 01:05:22.286
(loud heavy rock)

01:05:22.286 --> 01:05:24.321
- * Did you come to party?

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:28.492
* I fucking came to party

01:05:29.393 --> 01:05:31.495
All right, bitches right!

01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:36.200
We got two more bitches
for you tonight,

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.303
come in here, tell some
jokes, make you laugh.

01:05:39.303 --> 01:05:42.472
This next bitch comes all
the way from New York,

01:05:42.472 --> 01:05:45.142
fucking City, and if you ask me,

01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:50.447
she is pretty full of
herself, so give it up for

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.682
the bitch, Melissa Kononen!

01:05:54.818 --> 01:05:57.821
(audience clapping)

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:06.396
- Yeah, bitches, right.

01:06:07.331 --> 01:06:08.999
Right, right, right.

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:19.976
Hey guys, so I'm
Melissa Kononen,

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:22.912
and I'm gonna ask
you how you're doing,

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:25.082
but please, do not
applaud, you can boo,

01:06:25.082 --> 01:06:27.884
you can do whatever
you want, please,

01:06:27.884 --> 01:06:29.586
just do what is in your heart.

01:06:29.586 --> 01:06:31.055
How are you guys doing?

01:06:31.055 --> 01:06:34.058
(audience cheering)

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:37.194
Uh, that's a little like...

01:06:37.194 --> 01:06:40.264
It's not like aah, yeah,
that's like a medium.

01:06:40.264 --> 01:06:43.033
So, if you ask me, you
probably don't give a fuck,

01:06:43.033 --> 01:06:45.001
but I'm going to tell
you, I'm doing awful.

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:48.172
I woke up with a cold, and
I'm delirious at this point,

01:06:48.172 --> 01:06:51.208
and to be honest, I'm kind
of loving it right now,

01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:54.244
having this cold, because
it's my own little portable

01:06:54.244 --> 01:06:56.080
disease, that I get to
take with me everywhere,

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.848
it's all mine, not
yours, it's mine,

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.317
my disease, mine, mine, mine!

01:07:00.317 --> 01:07:01.818
And I get to sleep
with it in the night,

01:07:01.818 --> 01:07:04.321
I'm like oh, it's my cold,
oh disease, you're okay,

01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:08.192
you're mine, oh I get
to cuddle with you.

01:07:08.192 --> 01:07:11.828
I had vegan chili earlier,
and it gave me heartburn.

01:07:11.828 --> 01:07:14.798
And I didn't like it, you
know what else I hate?

01:07:14.798 --> 01:07:19.469
I hate it when nice dudes
refuse to call women cunts.

01:07:19.469 --> 01:07:21.871
You know, specifically
this woman, because um,

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:25.242
if you don't call me a cunt,
I'm gonna find someone else

01:07:25.242 --> 01:07:26.410
who will, and they
will probably suck.

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:28.145
- You're weird!

01:07:28.145 --> 01:07:29.546
- Oh, great, woo!

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:32.649
Like this guy right here,
he fits the description,

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:33.483
how you doing man?

01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:34.851
- Tell a joke all ready.

01:07:34.851 --> 01:07:37.187
- What's your name?

01:07:37.187 --> 01:07:38.655
Come on, what's your name?

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:39.589
- Um, Dave.

01:07:40.757 --> 01:07:44.328
- Oh, Dave, that's
your real voice?

01:07:44.328 --> 01:07:47.297
When you're not
putting a voice on,

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:50.600
you're like ugh, um,
Dave, hey um Dave.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.902
So, call me a fucking
cunt right now.

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:57.607
Call me a fucking cunt,
do it, we're all waiting!

01:07:57.607 --> 01:08:00.410
We're all waiting
for you um Dave,

01:08:01.878 --> 01:08:05.382
we're all waiting for you
to call me a fucking cunt,

01:08:05.382 --> 01:08:08.218
so call me a fucking cunt!

01:08:08.218 --> 01:08:11.155
I heard you earlier,
come on, do it.

01:08:11.155 --> 01:08:13.357
Don't worry about
her, she won't mind,

01:08:13.357 --> 01:08:16.826
she likes it, she likes
when you call her a cunt,

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:18.094
so why don't you
do it to me man?

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:20.930
Call me a fucking cunt, no?

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:25.569
All right, fine, whatever,
just being a pussy.

01:08:25.569 --> 01:08:27.036
See all you nice guys
out there, please,

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:30.506
just do me a favor,
call me a fucking cunt,

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:32.676
when I'm being a fucking cunt.

01:08:32.676 --> 01:08:36.112
So I can stop hearing it
from abusive assholes.

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:40.317
Okay, nope, you know what
I also don't understand?

01:08:40.317 --> 01:08:42.319
What's really wrong with
fucking your cousin.

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:45.322
(audience laughing)

01:09:17.254 --> 01:09:20.657
- (mumbles) Four sugars!

01:09:22.326 --> 01:09:23.693
- Sorry.

01:09:23.693 --> 01:09:26.630
- Jesus Cali, how
many times I have to--

01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:28.232
- I'm sorry, Billy.

01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:32.536
- What the fuck is
wrong with you anyway?

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:45.148
(horn beeping)

01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:48.051
You, go, go!

01:09:55.725 --> 01:09:58.395
(door slamming)

01:10:15.245 --> 01:10:18.848
- No, he's 66 years
old, but he drinks pee.

01:10:18.848 --> 01:10:22.018
The thing is, so I don't
know, just looking at him,

01:10:22.018 --> 01:10:23.553
makes me wonder if
it works because,

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:27.924
they say it helps your
body diagnose sicknesses,

01:10:27.924 --> 01:10:32.095
if you don't drink caffeine,
or alcohol, or eat meat...

01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:37.767
(light chattering)

01:10:39.469 --> 01:10:43.640
- Hi, how you doing, oh wow
look at this, that is my face.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:47.143
Cunt face, there you are.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:49.913
- Thank you.

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:51.315
- Use protection.

01:10:54.418 --> 01:10:55.819
Well, that was shit.

01:10:55.819 --> 01:10:56.986
- [Female] It was precious.

01:10:56.986 --> 01:10:58.221
- Oh, fuck you.

01:10:59.155 --> 01:11:00.824
- Got another one.

01:11:00.824 --> 01:11:02.225
- Lovely.

01:11:02.225 --> 01:11:04.227
- Water, no ice, please.

01:11:09.065 --> 01:11:09.899
Hi.

01:11:14.237 --> 01:11:15.972
You were really good.

01:11:27.183 --> 01:11:28.685
- Can I have that?

01:11:33.823 --> 01:11:34.658
Mmm.

01:11:42.332 --> 01:11:43.733
- Fuck you Alyssa.

01:11:43.733 --> 01:11:45.969
(laughing)

01:11:52.609 --> 01:11:53.943
- Do I know you?

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:57.814
- Um, kind of.

01:12:04.688 --> 01:12:05.622
- Oh, fuck.

01:12:10.026 --> 01:12:12.562
- None of this is
real by the way,

01:12:12.562 --> 01:12:14.998
but actually, it is all real.

01:12:17.133 --> 01:12:19.803
(door slamming)

01:12:30.447 --> 01:12:31.548
- Yo, this your ride?

01:12:31.548 --> 01:12:33.016
- Yeah.

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:36.920
- Toss me the keys, I
wanna show you something.

01:12:43.593 --> 01:12:47.764
So, I assume it's
no coincidence, you
showing up here?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:51.835
- No.

01:12:56.706 --> 01:13:00.209
(radio stations scanning)

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:05.482
- Oh fuck yeah, this is my jam!

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:09.919
(fast rock rap music)

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:43.419
(tires squealing)

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:44.521
Fucking cunt!

01:13:48.324 --> 01:13:49.493
What the fuck?

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.328
- Alyssa?

01:13:52.328 --> 01:13:53.162
- What?

01:13:54.363 --> 01:13:56.232
- What was it you
wanted to show me?

01:13:56.232 --> 01:13:57.534
- What?

01:13:57.534 --> 01:14:01.070
- What was it you
wanted to show me?

01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:04.307
- Oh, honey, let's
get fucked up first!

01:14:10.647 --> 01:14:12.816
(gagging)

01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:23.159
(loud knocking)

01:14:27.564 --> 01:14:30.834
(light rhythmic music)

01:14:36.272 --> 01:14:37.106
Come on.

01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:49.018
(dark loud heavy metal music)

01:16:24.681 --> 01:16:28.017
(dark orchestral music)

01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:37.546
(gagging)

01:18:38.414 --> 01:18:40.884
Hey, look at me, are you okay?

01:18:48.892 --> 01:18:51.727
(mumbled talking)

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:59.302
Once every three or four months,
but we'd never do anything,

01:18:59.302 --> 01:19:01.905
he'd just stand there, and look.

01:19:04.974 --> 01:19:08.277
When I was younger, I
pretended like I was asleep,

01:19:08.277 --> 01:19:10.013
like I knew it was
creepy or whatever,

01:19:10.013 --> 01:19:13.616
but I didn't know why, and
then when I got a little older

01:19:13.616 --> 01:19:17.420
I would stare right back at
him, never told him to leave.

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:21.024
And he'd still just,
you know, stand there.

01:19:22.225 --> 01:19:24.794
Anyway, I told my mom.

01:19:24.794 --> 01:19:28.965
Yeah, a few years ago, she
called me a lying little bitch.

01:19:31.467 --> 01:19:33.402
Billy was never so bad.

01:19:35.304 --> 01:19:38.207
At least he didn't stare.

01:19:38.207 --> 01:19:42.211
You know, he tried to kill
himself after you left, right?

01:19:42.211 --> 01:19:45.548
He said he was gonna
go jump off a bridge.

01:19:45.548 --> 01:19:47.050
And that was about
the time he started

01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:50.519
calling me all the fucking
time, and leaving these,

01:19:50.519 --> 01:19:54.523
like, long ass messages,
and sometimes he'd cry.

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:58.962
Then, you know, I mean,
he called me to tell me

01:19:58.962 --> 01:20:03.132
that you came back, after that,
he didn't call me anymore.

01:20:05.068 --> 01:20:07.971
Did you find him
sexy or something?

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:11.207
(laughing)

01:20:11.207 --> 01:20:12.375
- Yeah, I did.

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:22.485
- Oh, that's weird, what
do you even know about him?

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:28.424
- He said he fought in Vietnam.

01:20:29.792 --> 01:20:30.626
- Really?

01:20:33.129 --> 01:20:36.866
- [Cali] He said he was
in Danang for a year.

01:20:37.733 --> 01:20:40.169
- Billy said a lot of things.

01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:47.343
He told my mom that he made
a fortune selling rare coins.

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:55.651
He told me that he was a
rough necker in California,

01:20:57.253 --> 01:21:00.089
and that he shat,
shot, I'm sorry,

01:21:02.992 --> 01:21:06.495
he shot a guy in the
back of the head,

01:21:06.495 --> 01:21:09.698
because the guy broke
into his apartment,

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:13.102
and was trying to stab
him in the kidney.

01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:18.407
And he said that he went to
that guys grave to piss on it,

01:21:18.407 --> 01:21:22.345
but it was Memorial Day,
and there were like...

01:21:23.479 --> 01:21:26.382
There were all
these people around,

01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:31.720
so he settled for
just spitting on it.

01:21:34.924 --> 01:21:38.094
He didn't tell you
that story, did he?

01:21:47.303 --> 01:21:50.373
What are you doing
here, little Cali?

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.576
- I need to find him.

01:21:56.312 --> 01:21:57.146
- Why?

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:04.253
He's dead, I mean,
probably, right?

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:14.163
I mean, you wanna
know what I think?

01:22:15.598 --> 01:22:19.135
You probably don't, but
I'm gonna tell you anyway.

01:22:19.135 --> 01:22:21.304
I think that you miss him.

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:26.109
I think that you love him.

01:22:28.711 --> 01:22:29.545
- I...

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:36.219
You don't know
what he did to me.

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:39.022
- What he did to you.

01:22:43.859 --> 01:22:47.930
Come on, I was gonna show
you something, come on.

01:23:18.261 --> 01:23:20.629
See this tree here?

01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:24.700
My mom, she hated Billy,
and then when I told her

01:23:26.702 --> 01:23:30.206
about my step dad, you
know, just staring,

01:23:34.577 --> 01:23:37.580
she hated him too,
but not at first.

01:23:40.983 --> 01:23:44.187
She didn't believe me at first.

01:23:44.187 --> 01:23:48.357
Then she thought about it,
and my step dad dropped dead

01:23:51.594 --> 01:23:54.763
one day, while mowing the lawn.

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:56.932
I was away, she was alone.

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:05.541
I told her about what he did
to me and then I left her.

01:24:07.176 --> 01:24:10.113
I was gone when
she drove out here,

01:24:10.113 --> 01:24:13.216
and she sat at the
base of this tree.

01:24:14.683 --> 01:24:17.086
She had my step dad's pistol.

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:22.691
Billy wasn't
serious, but she was.

01:24:46.048 --> 01:24:48.384
What did you do to him Cali?

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:50.419
- What?

01:24:51.787 --> 01:24:53.856
- What did you do to him?

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:57.092
I mean, you went back right?

01:24:57.092 --> 01:25:00.929
And my mom was dead, and
I thought he and I could,

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:03.799
I don't know, I don't
know, work on things maybe.

01:25:03.799 --> 01:25:07.603
He was the only fucking
family that I had left.

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:08.671
What the fuck.

01:25:08.671 --> 01:25:12.475
(loud thumping and screaming)

01:25:19.315 --> 01:25:20.149
- Stop!

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:47.710
- Cali, look at me.

01:25:50.246 --> 01:25:52.415
(gasping)

01:25:53.682 --> 01:25:57.320
You can go out with
him, if you want to.

01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.488
(sobbing)

01:26:07.029 --> 01:26:09.965
I mean, if you really want to.

01:26:09.965 --> 01:26:11.033
- Should I call him?

01:26:11.033 --> 01:26:12.268
- Mom, shut--

01:26:12.268 --> 01:26:15.338
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

01:26:15.338 --> 01:26:19.408
Him, and then this man,
is that who you wanna be?

01:26:30.653 --> 01:26:33.088
- (mumbling)

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:59.582
- You wanna go back to him?

01:26:59.582 --> 01:27:03.686
Okay, go ahead, I'm not
gonna stop you, go, go, go!

01:27:46.595 --> 01:27:48.263
- [Female] You okay?

01:27:53.902 --> 01:27:54.737
- No.

01:28:13.155 --> 01:28:15.891
- So, do you wanna
talk about it?

01:28:34.377 --> 01:28:38.381
You know what I used to
do when I first started?

01:28:39.548 --> 01:28:43.118
I just shut my eyes,
and go away somewhere.

01:28:45.354 --> 01:28:49.625
Some place where I could
be anybody other than me.

01:28:49.625 --> 01:28:53.796
Not like a movie star or
anything, just a wife, maybe.

01:28:57.065 --> 01:28:57.900
And a mom.

01:29:01.103 --> 01:29:03.872
I'd see myself in
a suburb somewhere,

01:29:03.872 --> 01:29:08.043
working from home as a graphic
designer, interior decorator.

01:29:10.112 --> 01:29:13.449
I used to draw, I was
pretty good at it.

01:29:20.956 --> 01:29:23.291
Anyway, something like that.

01:29:27.463 --> 01:29:31.634
I'd have three kids, twin
boys, and a little girl.

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:38.874
Her name would be Emma
Rose, and the boys would

01:29:38.874 --> 01:29:41.043
be called Jack and Joshua.

01:29:46.114 --> 01:29:49.785
My husband would work
in real estate, David,

01:29:51.454 --> 01:29:54.557
but I'd call him
Dee, a handsome guy,

01:29:57.926 --> 01:30:02.097
sort of soft, skinny with a
little potbelly, weak eyes.

01:30:10.606 --> 01:30:14.009
I always had a thing
for guys in glasses.

01:30:16.979 --> 01:30:20.415
He'd come home early
from work sometimes,

01:30:21.584 --> 01:30:25.087
and we'd take the
kids out to dinner.

01:30:25.087 --> 01:30:27.756
Nothing fancy, Chuck E Cheese,

01:30:27.756 --> 01:30:30.325
wherever the kids wanted to go.

01:30:32.628 --> 01:30:36.799
Our five year anniversary,
he'd take me to this little,

01:30:38.601 --> 01:30:42.370
this little bed and breakfast
up in the mountains,

01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:46.308
and we'd wander the
streets, and window shop.

01:30:46.308 --> 01:30:50.278
Afterwards, go back
up to the hotel room

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:53.616
and make love for
hours, by candlelight.

01:30:56.318 --> 01:30:58.153
He'd always be gentle.

01:31:02.725 --> 01:31:06.461
In the morning, he'd
give me this little pair

01:31:07.395 --> 01:31:09.498
of diamond stud earrings.

01:31:13.502 --> 01:31:16.572
All he could afford
without taking out a loan,

01:31:16.572 --> 01:31:20.408
so nothing all that
special, but nice, lovely.

01:31:25.113 --> 01:31:27.215
Our life would be lovely.

01:31:36.659 --> 01:31:40.829
So that's what I think about
when the men would be doing,

01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:45.834
you know, what they'd be doing.

01:31:50.005 --> 01:31:54.076
And it helped, for a while,
for a while I thought

01:31:56.979 --> 01:31:59.481
it may even still be possible.

01:32:02.751 --> 01:32:05.754
He could still be
out there, my Dee,

01:32:09.091 --> 01:32:11.594
and maybe we could still meet.

01:32:12.961 --> 01:32:17.566
And he could give me my
lovely little life somewhere,

01:32:17.566 --> 01:32:20.168
where I could be somebody else.

01:32:23.906 --> 01:32:25.574
This is it, I'd say.

01:32:27.542 --> 01:32:31.714
This guy, this hundred bucks,
I'm done, I'm getting out.

01:32:40.989 --> 01:32:42.424
Now I can barely
remember what he was

01:32:42.424 --> 01:32:44.927
supposed to look like, my Dee.

01:33:01.209 --> 01:33:05.380
He left this out here, he
didn't want you to see it.

01:33:09.217 --> 01:33:12.621
He told me to be gone
before you woke up.

01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:22.765
He's never gonna get
any better, Cali.

01:33:25.868 --> 01:33:30.038
Cali, none of this is ever
going to get any better.

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:55.197
(gurgling and moaning)

01:34:48.083 --> 01:34:50.018
- Ma'am, can you hear me?

01:34:50.018 --> 01:34:51.854
Nod if you understand.

01:34:58.093 --> 01:35:02.865
Need you to follow my fingers
without moving your head.

01:35:02.865 --> 01:35:05.600
(loud breathing)

01:35:10.672 --> 01:35:14.843
- Was it, I don't know, was
it a stroke or something?

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:28.056
(dial tone)

01:35:35.898 --> 01:35:38.566
(phone ringing)

01:35:40.168 --> 01:35:41.603
- I see no evidence
of a concussion,

01:35:41.603 --> 01:35:45.440
or any other lasting damage,
so you're free to go.

01:35:49.077 --> 01:35:53.415
Do you have someone who
can come pick you up?

01:35:53.415 --> 01:35:56.084
(phone ringing)

01:35:59.154 --> 01:36:03.258
- So, there's nothing more
you can tell us, Ma'am?

01:36:06.194 --> 01:36:10.365
Ma'am, you're sure there's
nothing more you can tell us?

01:36:13.201 --> 01:36:15.871
(phone ringing)

01:36:32.154 --> 01:36:34.589
- Cali, I'm here to help you.

01:36:39.962 --> 01:36:41.463
Do you understand?

01:36:46.801 --> 01:36:48.636
Your mom's on her way.

01:36:52.074 --> 01:36:52.908
- Not her.

01:36:55.343 --> 01:36:57.512
- It isn't up to you Cali.

01:37:01.616 --> 01:37:04.386
- What are you
gonna do with him?

01:37:09.257 --> 01:37:10.993
- He's going to jail.

01:37:28.376 --> 01:37:31.046
(light sobbing)

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:40.688
- Ma'am, if this
was your boyfriend,

01:37:42.357 --> 01:37:46.328
we have resources that
we can help you with.

01:37:46.328 --> 01:37:48.997
(phone ringing)

01:37:59.474 --> 01:38:00.608
- [Roy] Hello.

01:38:02.844 --> 01:38:03.678
- Hi.

01:38:05.914 --> 01:38:07.015
- [Roy] What?

01:38:11.586 --> 01:38:13.021
- I'm, I'm sorry.

01:38:21.863 --> 01:38:26.034
- [Roy] It's not your fault,
I should have known better.

01:38:27.235 --> 01:38:30.738
I don't know what the
fuck I was thinking.

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:33.741
- I, um--

01:38:34.776 --> 01:38:35.877
- [Roy] What?

01:38:42.884 --> 01:38:44.219
- Can I still...

01:38:49.424 --> 01:38:51.493
Can I come to your place?

01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:58.700
- [Roy] Didn't you all
ready leave him once?

01:39:01.936 --> 01:39:03.871
I'm sorry, I thought...

01:39:05.507 --> 01:39:08.510
I don't know, I don't
know what I thought.

01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:11.846
I don't need this
shit, okay, good luck.

01:39:17.252 --> 01:39:19.587
(dial tone)

01:39:36.138 --> 01:39:39.607
(phone ringing)

01:39:39.607 --> 01:39:40.442
- Roy.

01:39:43.311 --> 01:39:45.047
- [Operator] We're sorry,
you have reached a number

01:39:45.047 --> 01:39:48.650
that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.

01:39:48.650 --> 01:39:51.553
If you feel you have reached
this recording in error,

01:39:51.553 --> 01:39:56.024
please check the number
or try your call again.

01:39:56.024 --> 01:39:57.092
We're sorry--

01:40:06.901 --> 01:40:10.172
(light peaceful music)

01:40:11.739 --> 01:40:15.510
* I've got something for you

01:40:18.846 --> 01:40:22.250
* Oh, don't turn me down

01:40:25.987 --> 01:40:29.757
* Leave me cold and blue

01:40:29.757 --> 01:40:33.528
* Don't break my heart

01:40:33.528 --> 01:40:35.097
- Cali, look at me.

01:40:40.435 --> 01:40:42.036
- We didn't.

01:40:42.036 --> 01:40:42.870
- I know.

01:41:06.661 --> 01:41:09.331
You're beautiful, you know that?

01:41:41.563 --> 01:41:45.733
You need to know that there
was never anyone else but me.

01:42:04.986 --> 01:42:05.887
I love you.

01:42:09.491 --> 01:42:10.925
- I love you too.

01:42:27.008 --> 01:42:27.842
- Roy?

01:42:41.323 --> 01:42:43.558
(sizzling)

01:42:56.037 --> 01:42:59.207
- I've been thinking,
and if you want,

01:43:01.576 --> 01:43:05.347
we could, you know, have
him over some night.

01:43:07.048 --> 01:43:09.116
I mean, only if you want.

01:43:11.886 --> 01:43:14.289
You two, obviously, I mean...

01:43:20.295 --> 01:43:22.196
It could be hot, right?

01:43:23.465 --> 01:43:25.900
Oh fuck it, look, if you want,

01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:30.071
we'll have him over, and you
know, you two can do whatever.

01:43:32.874 --> 01:43:37.044
You were cool with Selena,
I can be cool with this.

01:43:40.882 --> 01:43:43.651
If you want, I
could be way cool.

01:43:49.424 --> 01:43:51.593
Jesus, not too much, okay?

01:43:53.595 --> 01:43:57.599
You only need a pinch
to bring out the flavor.

01:43:57.599 --> 01:43:58.666
Anyway, Cali.

01:44:16.684 --> 01:44:19.621
(dark opera music)

01:44:44.846 --> 01:44:47.349
(loud crying)

01:44:49.984 --> 01:44:52.219
(sizzling)

01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:20.515
- So what's next Cali?

01:45:22.249 --> 01:45:24.752
Calliope, okay, you know what,

01:45:26.454 --> 01:45:27.689
you can give me the silent
treatment, if you want,

01:45:27.689 --> 01:45:30.358
that's fine, I'm gonna call him.

01:45:32.259 --> 01:45:35.530
You know what else, I'm
gonna tell him he can

01:45:35.530 --> 01:45:37.599
fuck you for a 100 bucks.

01:45:42.036 --> 01:45:44.038
50, if he lets me watch.

01:45:54.816 --> 01:45:56.584
(screaming)

01:45:56.584 --> 01:45:58.753
(gagging)

01:46:22.343 --> 01:46:23.845
- Look at me Cali.

01:46:33.888 --> 01:46:34.822
Look at me.

01:46:45.467 --> 01:46:46.400
Look at me!

01:46:58.345 --> 01:46:59.180
- Morning.

01:47:03.184 --> 01:47:05.853
(light raining)

01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:11.493
- You're a lying little bitch.

01:47:39.453 --> 01:47:41.789
(gasping)

01:47:41.789 --> 01:47:42.624
- You...

01:47:44.859 --> 01:47:46.761
- Oh my God, oh my God.

01:48:11.252 --> 01:48:13.521
Oh my God, oh my God, shit.

01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:21.028
I gotta call somebody!

01:48:21.028 --> 01:48:23.097
(crying)

01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:30.872
- Now, say you're sorry.

01:48:37.511 --> 01:48:38.512
- I'm sorry.

01:48:41.616 --> 01:48:43.450
- Good, I forgive you.

01:49:25.793 --> 01:49:27.561
It's good to see you.

01:49:32.934 --> 01:49:37.371
You remember, remember
that song I wrote for you.

01:49:37.371 --> 01:49:38.706
How did that go?

01:49:40.107 --> 01:49:42.276
(humming)

01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:47.048
* Your stars are
fire, you stop the sun

01:49:47.048 --> 01:49:48.983
* The truth of me may be a liar

01:49:48.983 --> 01:49:53.154
* But never doubt my love

01:49:55.056 --> 01:49:57.291
You know, I never wanted...

01:50:03.097 --> 01:50:06.600
I sorry, I'm fucking
this up, God damn it.

01:50:11.038 --> 01:50:14.475
You know, I've always
known it was wrong,

01:50:15.376 --> 01:50:17.478
the whole you and me thing.

01:50:17.478 --> 01:50:20.047
I didn't want it to be, it was.

01:50:21.215 --> 01:50:24.485
But it was, I just,
I wanted you so much.

01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:37.131
And I really wanted it to
be different this time,

01:50:37.131 --> 01:50:39.701
I thought that maybe you could,

01:50:41.035 --> 01:50:43.037
you were my chance to...

01:50:44.839 --> 01:50:46.674
Ah shit, I don't know.

01:50:48.876 --> 01:50:52.146
So, I guess maybe,
I made things worse.

01:50:56.684 --> 01:50:58.686
I told myself all
the usual things,

01:50:58.686 --> 01:51:02.656
how you were mature,
you were an old soul,

01:51:02.656 --> 01:51:05.492
whatever the fuck,
you were a kid.

01:51:06.928 --> 01:51:08.763
I should never have...

01:51:14.068 --> 01:51:18.239
So anyway, I guess, I think
I sort of took it out on you.

01:51:25.913 --> 01:51:29.316
But I did love you,
I do love you, you...

01:51:36.023 --> 01:51:40.294
Jesus Christ Cali, you
were the best thing that

01:51:40.294 --> 01:51:43.630
ever happened to me,
and I fucked it up.

01:51:48.435 --> 01:51:50.104
- No, no you didn't.

01:52:02.616 --> 01:52:06.453
* When you're through with me

01:52:08.622 --> 01:52:11.959
* When your heart aches

01:52:14.996 --> 01:52:18.232
* When your head spins

01:52:21.135 --> 01:52:24.138
* When you tempt me

01:52:27.809 --> 01:52:30.912
* When you finish me

01:52:34.248 --> 01:52:37.084
* When you cut me

01:52:40.654 --> 01:52:43.557
* When you kill me

01:52:46.961 --> 01:52:49.630
* When you forgive me

01:52:49.630 --> 01:52:50.464
We did.

01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:56.871
* When you want to hold me

01:52:59.941 --> 01:53:02.609
* If you bury me

01:53:06.347 --> 01:53:09.083
* If you lose me

01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:16.723
* Don't say the word

01:53:19.326 --> 01:53:22.663
* Don't waste your time

01:53:25.666 --> 01:53:28.502
* Don't expect me

01:53:31.839 --> 01:53:34.942
* Just get rid of me

01:53:38.312 --> 01:53:42.483
* Just break me

01:53:45.987 --> 01:53:48.589
(laughing)

01:53:48.589 --> 01:53:49.423
Okay.

01:53:56.430 --> 01:53:57.431
- I'm gonna get your nose.

01:53:57.431 --> 01:53:59.934
- No, I'll bite your nose off.

01:54:10.711 --> 01:54:11.612
- No hands.

01:54:16.350 --> 01:54:18.419
I have something for you.

01:54:19.686 --> 01:54:20.922
- Uh huh, what?

01:54:21.923 --> 01:54:24.591
(low sad music)

01:55:00.794 --> 01:55:03.364
Now that the stars are on fire,

01:55:05.799 --> 01:55:08.135
thou that the sun doth move.

01:55:10.871 --> 01:55:15.042
Doubt truth to be a liar,
but never doubt my love.

01:55:37.098 --> 01:55:40.001
I'm sorry Billy,
but I've gotta go.

01:55:44.638 --> 01:55:47.808
(light guitar music)

01:59:48.282 --> 01:59:50.951
(loud rumbling)
