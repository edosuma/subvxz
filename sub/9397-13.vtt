00:01.120 --> 00:02.235
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.320 --> 00:03.469
Nathan,

00:03.719 --> 00:05.915
did you pay Chris
to help me with my music?

00:06.000 --> 00:08.150
If you are gonna help me
with Haley's record

00:08.240 --> 00:10.390
well, you could maybe
move into the house with me.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.311
You're even prettier than I remembered.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.391
Keith Scott?
Put your hands behind your head.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.789
You're under arrest for
the attempted murder of Dan Scott.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.438
The arrest was a favor,

00:18.520 --> 00:20.636
but without anything solid,
I can't hold him.

00:21.160 --> 00:22.991
2,798 miles.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.117
That's how far apart
our dream schools are.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.590
If I tell you not to go to Stanford,
I'm telling you not to follow your dreams.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.148
If I tell you to go, I'm saying
I don't want to be with you.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.308
I need your help.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.231
- She's using you.
- How?

00:34.320 --> 00:37.949
But I know that if she's being nice to you,
it is for a reason, and not a good one.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.268
I have cancer.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.229
I want you to be here
when the album comes out.

00:42.560 --> 00:44.073
I will be here, Peyton.

00:44.160 --> 00:47.391
<i>It's okay that you're into Peyton.</i>
<i>I found the things in your closet.</i>

00:47.520 --> 00:48.839
I hurt you pretty bad.

00:49.600 --> 00:50.919
<i>I'm not gonna do it again.</i>

01:44.360 --> 01:46.794
It's crazy outside. You got a towel?

01:47.520 --> 01:49.556
Do you have my next letter?

01:52.160 --> 01:53.593
Linen closet.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.678
Well, I hope I don't disappoint you.

02:00.760 --> 02:03.832
I know I set the bar pretty high
with the first two.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.597
Oh, Lucas.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.388
Naughty.

02:12.680 --> 02:13.999
Is it okay?

02:17.600 --> 02:19.192
Hold that thought.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.838
You better not have finished
all the hot chocolate.

02:32.160 --> 02:33.479
What's going on?

02:41.600 --> 02:42.919
It's time.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.272
The record's done.

02:46.640 --> 02:47.959
I gotta go.

02:48.920 --> 02:52.708
It's late, Ellie. There's a storm, you know.
What are you rushing off to?

02:51.640 --> 02:54.552
There's just some things
that I can't do here.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.678
So this is goodbye?

03:01.640 --> 03:02.868
For now.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.349
Hello?

03:15.720 --> 03:16.835
Hello?

03:18.640 --> 03:20.551
You braved the storm for me?

03:20.960 --> 03:23.838
I braved the storm for you
and <i>Say Anything.</i>

03:22.960 --> 03:25.190
Your parents don't mind you
having a boy in your room?

03:28.640 --> 03:31.108
Under three boys is fine.
Under three beers, too.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.349
Although I tend to break both those rules
from time to time.

03:33.520 --> 03:34.509
Want one?

03:37.120 --> 03:40.317
No, thanks, I don't really drink much.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.553
Suit yourself.

03:41.880 --> 03:42.915
Yeah.

03:43.320 --> 03:44.355
Thanks.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.232
What are you doing?

03:50.880 --> 03:52.029
Sorry. I...

03:54.240 --> 03:56.674
I just want to be able
to prove I was really here.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.679
You know, like, in your bedroom.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.391
You're so cute. Come on.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.551
Let's make it a good one.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.152
This is so bad.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.351
Yeah, I never should've let
Lucas and Haley

04:14.440 --> 04:17.000
build that golf course on the rooftop.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.999
Speaking of, I got ahold of Lucas.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.991
He's having dinner at Brooke's.

04:21.880 --> 04:25.509
So I told him to stay put
until the worst of the storm passes,

04:23.960 --> 04:26.155
even if it's not until morning.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.031
You told Lucas
to spend the night with Brooke?

04:31.360 --> 04:33.874
You're, like, every teenage boy's
dream mom.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.829
- It's not like that.
- Oh, yes, it is.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.834
Single guy. Single girl.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.153
- Lots of history.
- Nothing's gonna happen.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.198
We'll see about that.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.154
Haley, what are you doing here?
Aren't the roads all closed?

04:59.960 --> 05:01.313
It's like martial law or something.

05:02.560 --> 05:05.358
I know, I know, but I had to talk to you.
I decided to go to Duke.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.070
- Okay, why don't you come inside?
- Okay.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.510
Okay, so I've been doing some research

05:11.320 --> 05:13.390
and Duke has an amazing
basketball program.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.993
I mean, their coach, this guy,

05:15.720 --> 05:18.075
Coach... Krzyzewski? He's, like, a legend.

05:17.240 --> 05:18.753
Coach Krzyzewski?

05:19.680 --> 05:20.999
Yeah. What?

05:21.280 --> 05:22.554
People call him Coach K.

05:22.760 --> 05:25.718
And so should you.
I mean, you should have this opportunity.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.633
Duke's a really great school,

05:27.200 --> 05:30.397
and I think I could be really happy there
especially if I was with you.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.031
Well, you can't go to Duke, Hales.
And I don't want you to.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.071
You don't want me to. Right.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.834
Right, what was I thinking?

05:41.760 --> 05:45.309
Because you told me that you love me
after the basketball game, and silly me,

05:43.040 --> 05:46.396
I just thought that feeling would last
for longer than, I don't know, one night.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.193
But then again, I forgot.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.315
You're the guy who loves
to rip the rug out from underneath me

05:51.720 --> 05:54.154
just when I feel like we're getting
some sort of stable ground.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.035
Haley...

05:56.520 --> 05:59.398
You freak out after we have sex
for the first time in God knows how long.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.517
And by the way,
I know exactly how long it was.

06:00.600 --> 06:04.070
And frankly, I'm still pissed off at you
about that whole birth-control thing.

06:02.560 --> 06:03.549
What?

06:06.120 --> 06:09.396
Haley, you can't go to Duke
because I'm going to Stanford.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.792
Good sign or bad?

06:13.880 --> 06:14.995
Mouth?

06:21.480 --> 06:23.516
Did you just try to kiss me?

06:23.760 --> 06:24.954
Sort of.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.518
Wow! Ballsy.

06:28.240 --> 06:29.832
So, is that why they call you Mouth?

06:30.640 --> 06:33.393
No, but you're the one
who invited me over to watch a movie,

06:32.320 --> 06:35.517
And then you offer me a beer
and turn out the lights.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.071
It's a blackout, Mouth.

06:36.760 --> 06:37.909
Sorry.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.189
Don't laugh.

06:43.600 --> 06:44.999
Don't cry. It's just a blackout.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.839
I am not crying.
I'm looking for a flashlight.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.631
God, this is my worst nightmare.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.430
Where is my <i>Powerpuff Girls</i> nightlight
when I need it?

06:53.120 --> 06:55.315
We should probably call Peyton.

06:55.120 --> 06:58.157
I mean, I'm not sure if Ellie's around
and if the lights are out everywhere,

06:57.440 --> 07:01.149
- I'm kind of worried about her being alone.
- Yeah, I'm sure you are.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.274
Finally.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.715
- What the hell did you hit me for?
- Because you're an ass.

07:08.280 --> 07:11.636
Mr. Mayor, I have contacted
the Department of Power

07:12.840 --> 07:16.071
but it's gonna take
at least a couple of hours to fix.

07:21.480 --> 07:24.313
- And the entire city is dark?
- Yes, sir.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.234
Perfect.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.715
Wow! A blackout.

07:32.040 --> 07:35.316
Looks like you've got some pull
with the woman upstairs.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.668
I guess you really don't want me
to leave, huh?

07:41.800 --> 07:43.074
I told you.

07:45.800 --> 07:49.554
Well, assuming the lights
don't pop back on in a minute or two,

07:48.360 --> 07:50.510
are you in any way prepared
to deal with this?

07:50.760 --> 07:52.478
Oh, totally. Hold on.

07:54.680 --> 07:57.194
My dad got me this for my 13th birthday,

07:56.920 --> 07:59.878
right about the time he stopped knowing
what a girl would want.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.309
I've just been waiting
for an excuse to use it.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.751
And when was the last time
you changed the batteries?

08:05.600 --> 08:07.033
When I was 13.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.949
Okay, I'll stay. Just this last night.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.909
We've got Dippin' Dots, no "g",
Snack Pack Puddin', no "g",

08:17.960 --> 08:20.679
and my personal favorite,
Cap'n Crunch, no "t."

08:29.640 --> 08:32.029
Basically, foods missing consonants.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.270
I used to love snarfing down Cap'n Crunch

08:37.000 --> 08:39.433
watching Saturday morning cartoons
when I was a kid.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.556
What was that, like, a year ago?

08:42.520 --> 08:45.114
How could I be so young and feel so old?

08:45.040 --> 08:48.032
It's like, I never thought
that I would have this many big questions

08:48.240 --> 08:49.514
on my plate by now.

08:50.920 --> 08:53.036
Maybe this blackout is a sign.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.718
Well, that we need to deal
with everything.

08:55.720 --> 08:58.029
The future and all the decisions
we have to make.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.439
Do we have to?

08:59.840 --> 09:04.118
No, but until the lights come back on,
it's just you, me and the darkness, Hales.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.196
That sounds kind of nice.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.199
Keith, wow.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.552
I've got to get the name of your decorator.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.038
I'm so sorry, Rachel.
I mean, about kissing you.

09:33.160 --> 09:36.596
I just... I thought maybe
you'd invited me over here to...

09:35.840 --> 09:38.149
Well, I'm just sorry.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.838
- Stop apologizing, Mouth.
- Sure. Sorry.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.038
Just take a breath.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.955
I don't really have a lot of experience
when it comes to girls and bedrooms.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.951
Or girls at all, really.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.710
- What about Erica Marsh?
- Exactly. Look how well that turned out.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.232
Okay. You have got
to be more confident, Mouth.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.997
More sure of yourself.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.509
Like,

10:05.960 --> 10:08.030
"Yeah, I tried to kiss you.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.440
- "What are you gonna do about it?"
- Really?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.558
And not so nice.

10:12.560 --> 10:16.155
You tell a girl she's nothing,
she'll come running.

10:15.920 --> 10:19.515
You gotta pick out a little flaw
and then blow it out of proportion.

10:19.640 --> 10:21.631
- I don't know.
- Come on, come on.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.791
Give it a shot. Lay it on me.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.789
Say something really mean.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.035
Well, your neck

10:31.840 --> 10:34.991
looks kind of long.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.436
But pretty. Really pretty.

10:37.840 --> 10:41.230
I don't want to be mean to you, Rachel,
or any girl. It's stupid.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.308
- Are you calling me stupid?
- No, I just think that...

10:45.480 --> 10:49.712
'Cause if you are,
you are getting sexier by the minute.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.075
Well?

10:51.520 --> 10:53.909
Well, I'd start a fire,
but all the wood's soaked.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.113
I'd turn on the flashlight,
but, you know, since it's broken

11:08.720 --> 11:11.359
'cause you lost your mind
and clobbered me with it...

11:11.200 --> 11:13.668
I mean, what got into you, anyway?

11:13.960 --> 11:16.793
- What got into me?
- Yeah.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.950
I'm sorry your dinner got ruined.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.874
Right, the dinner I was making for you

11:22.440 --> 11:25.750
with my stupid apron and my stupid pie.

11:24.600 --> 11:28.434
Okay, I'll start a fire.
I just have to find something else to burn.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.588
Great, why don't you start with this?

11:31.120 --> 11:34.317
- You want me to burn my letter?
- You really are clueless, aren't you?

11:35.040 --> 11:36.473
Look, I put a lot of heart into that letter.

11:38.440 --> 11:42.956
Okay, read it. Just skip to the last line.
Go ahead.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.473
What's wrong with the last line?
"You're my forever."

11:43.240 --> 11:45.993
- That sounds pretty damn good to me.
- Yeah, it sounds great.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.993
It sounded even better
when I read it the first time last spring

11:53.160 --> 11:55.628
in another letter you wrote to Peyton!

11:56.000 --> 11:59.515
- Brooke, stop, this is ridiculous!
- Ridiculous?

11:58.760 --> 12:02.150
I found that letter in your sad box
of Peyton whatever in your closet!

12:05.960 --> 12:08.838
"Dear Peyton, blah, blah, blah.
You're my forever. Love, Lucas."

12:09.560 --> 12:11.471
I don't even remember writing that.

12:13.040 --> 12:16.350
Well, you did!
Looks like forever just got a lot shorter.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.434
Brooke, I'm sorry. It was a mistake!

12:18.000 --> 12:20.116
Which time?
When you wrote it to me or Peyton?

12:21.400 --> 12:23.709
You know, you were the one
who was snooping through my closet.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.109
So not the point!

12:26.160 --> 12:28.993
Look, I know you feel vulnerable about
what you wrote to me in your letters...

12:28.560 --> 12:30.232
That is not why I'm upset right now!

12:29.800 --> 12:33.429
- And FYI, I am not your recycling bin!
- No, you're psychotic!

12:32.720 --> 12:34.517
This is a great album.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.755
It's good to know that kids
still listen to Led Zeppelin.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.591
Well, this kid does.

12:44.600 --> 12:48.070
<i>Ten Years Gone.</i>
It's one of the saddest songs ever.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.679
Yeah, but in, like, an awesome way.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.470
What's your saddest song ever?

12:53.280 --> 12:55.316
<i>Celebration.</i> Kool and the Gang.

12:56.320 --> 12:57.753
<i>Celebration?</i>

12:58.960 --> 13:01.952
It was playing in the hospital
when my mom died.

13:01.320 --> 13:03.993
- I'm sorry, Peyton.
- No, it's...

13:03.400 --> 13:07.916
Anyway, happiest song would be
<i>Happy Birthday.</i>

13:07.840 --> 13:10.308
I'm partial to any song
that ends with cake.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.754
What about you?

13:17.440 --> 13:20.432
<i>Here Comes a Regular.</i> The Replacements.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.594
Not exactly an up-tempo number.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.749
Yeah, but there's a great story behind it.

13:26.160 --> 13:27.354
Right before graduation,

13:31.160 --> 13:33.515
It was in the middle
of a field called The Meadow.

13:32.440 --> 13:33.919
Night comes,

13:35.600 --> 13:38.512
and this terrible thunderstorm rolls in.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.311
Thunder, lightning.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.319
None of the bands could play.

13:43.160 --> 13:46.311
Thirty thousand people,
mud up to our knees,

13:47.400 --> 13:48.879
waiting it out,

13:49.760 --> 13:52.035
praying for the storm to break.

13:51.240 --> 13:54.073
But it never did. Power's lost.

13:54.520 --> 13:57.080
There's nothing
but the sound of the rain.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.234
Then, out of the blackness,

14:00.200 --> 14:04.273
Paul Westerberg steps to center stage
with an acoustic guitar,

14:04.280 --> 14:06.350
and plays <i>Here Comes a Regular.</i>

14:06.920 --> 14:08.956
Thirty thousand people fall silent

14:09.440 --> 14:12.512
to hear that one acoustic guitar

14:13.600 --> 14:16.068
and the one voice that accompanied it.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.273
It was transcendent.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.314
Standing there in the darkness,

14:22.080 --> 14:24.878
listening to that song
with my best friends.

14:28.320 --> 14:31.995
I think that was the moment in my life
when I felt most alive.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.719
That's amazing.

14:33.920 --> 14:36.798
I would kill to have seen Westerberg
in his prime.

14:39.520 --> 14:42.751
Well, he finished in typical fashion.

14:44.600 --> 14:48.275
The song ended, he smiled, threw up,

14:46.000 --> 14:47.513
and then fell off the stage.

14:48.960 --> 14:51.633
What? Yes, I had a second bowl.
I was hungry.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.794
No, it's not that. I was just remembering.

14:56.280 --> 14:58.589
- Remembering what?
- Your hair.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.153
You wore it that way
the first day you tutored me.

15:07.080 --> 15:10.311
You remember how I wore my hair
the first day I tutored you?

15:09.680 --> 15:12.194
- Of course.
- What else do you remember?

15:12.360 --> 15:14.078
I remember the ugly-ass poncho
that you wore.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.599
Oh, my God, yes,
you've made your feelings

15:18.600 --> 15:21.558
for that particular item of clothing
very clear.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.871
Come on. Tell me really.

15:23.760 --> 15:26.991
Well, let's see, these jeans?

15:25.160 --> 15:27.674
You wore them the day
we fell asleep in the park together.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.198
And these shoes?

15:32.200 --> 15:35.715
You wore these the day we got stuck
at the DMV for five hours,

15:36.320 --> 15:39.869
while we waited for your new license
with my last name on it.

15:38.920 --> 15:40.638
What about my shirt?

15:40.560 --> 15:43.597
You wore that shirt one morning
when you sat in the living room

15:44.160 --> 15:46.549
and you were playing
that Beatles song on your guitar.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.638
The sun just framed your face
so perfectly.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.393
<i>Blackbird.</i>

15:55.160 --> 15:57.799
That was the name
of the Beatles song I played.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.195
I remember more than you think.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.594
I can't believe I didn't notice this.

16:04.320 --> 16:07.392
This is the first dollar
I ever earned in this café.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.758
Now it's ruined.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.756
Well, it's just a dollar.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.431
- Don't you remember who gave it to me?
- Of course I do.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.797
I bought the first cup of coffee
on the morning you opened.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.519
I had Lucas on one hip, a tray on the other.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.595
My parents thought I was crazy,
as did the rest of the town.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.039
Except for you.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.990
I'll never forget what you said.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.389
"Anyone who thinks
this is more than you can handle,

16:41.840 --> 16:44.912
"is less than the kind of person
you need in your life."

16:45.480 --> 16:47.232
I can't believe you remembered that.

16:48.960 --> 16:53.158
Please, I stayed up all the night before,
trying to figure out what I was gonna say.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.510
How about a kiss instead of a coffee?

16:54.600 --> 16:56.318
<i>Keith! Keith!</i>

16:56.440 --> 16:59.512
- Keith! Keith! Keith!
- Danny.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.159
It's just a storm, Danny.
It'll pass over soon.

17:27.240 --> 17:28.559
I'm scared.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.871
Here. Hold on to this.

17:34.360 --> 17:38.399
This way, I'll always be with you.
It'll keep you safe. I promise.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.308
Brooke, I'm sorry I said that.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.150
You're not psychotic,
I mean, a little disturbed, maybe.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.035
You think this is funny?

17:48.480 --> 17:51.199
Know what I think?
I think you're trying to sabotage us.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.797
Find any reason you can so you can end it.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.356
So that you don't have to worry
about getting hurt again.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.870
But the same words, Lucas?
The exact same words?

18:11.520 --> 18:13.476
I never sent that letter to Peyton.

18:14.320 --> 18:18.757
And I never sent my letters to you, either,
but they still meant something.

18:16.280 --> 18:19.238
Just tell me. Why me this time?
Why not Peyton?

18:18.480 --> 18:20.675
I can't say anything bad about Peyton.

18:23.760 --> 18:26.035
She's my friend.
And she's your best friend.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.870
That's okay.
You can say bad things about her.

18:30.320 --> 18:31.435
Oh, Brooke.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.316
The truth is I care about Peyton.

18:35.640 --> 18:38.632
- Then what is the difference?
- The difference?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.468
The difference is I love you, Brooke.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.116
I want to be with you, not Peyton.

18:44.280 --> 18:47.317
But why? I need to know why.

18:46.320 --> 18:49.949
Because you kink your eyebrow
when you're trying to be cute.

18:50.040 --> 18:53.589
Because you quote Camus even though
I've never actually seen you read.

18:54.360 --> 18:58.399
And because you miss your parents,
but you'll never ever admit that.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.913
And because

18:59.560 --> 19:03.394
I've given exactly two of these
embarrassing speeches in my entire life

19:03.360 --> 19:05.510
and they've both been with you.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.313
I mean,
that's got to mean something, right?

19:12.040 --> 19:15.919
And because we're both
gonna get pneumonia.

19:13.640 --> 19:16.074
But if you need to hear why I love you,

19:17.560 --> 19:19.232
I can go on all night.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.912
You did pretty good.

19:27.680 --> 19:30.240
Hey, Rachel, can I ask you a question?

19:32.680 --> 19:35.353
I get all that stuff about being confident,

19:35.720 --> 19:37.915
but I'm still trying to figure out

19:37.880 --> 19:40.189
why you invited me over here
in the first place.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.918
I thought we were gonna watch a movie.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.359
I know, but our friendship.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.629
Why me?

20:08.760 --> 20:10.432
Are you kidding me?

20:11.160 --> 20:14.675
You are more honest and comfortable
about who you are

20:12.880 --> 20:15.838
- than most of the other guys at school.
- Is it that?

20:16.360 --> 20:19.511
Or is it because you thought
it would make Brooke jealous?

20:18.320 --> 20:22.029
No offense, Mouth, but I don't need you
to make Brooke jealous.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.310
Great. I don't even get that.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.194
There was something kind of cool
about feeling like the pawn

20:27.760 --> 20:29.512
between two hot girls.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.231
Look, let me help you.

20:36.040 --> 20:38.395
Give you the benefit of my expertise.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.756
I can teach you
how to become one of the guys

20:41.160 --> 20:42.957
the elite girls drool over.

20:44.360 --> 20:46.999
- By being mean to them.
- Sometimes.

20:46.440 --> 20:49.796
But I'm not that guy, Rachel,
and I don't want to be.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.553
So maybe the elite girls
just aren't for me, then.

20:51.080 --> 20:55.471
But one of these days,
I'm gonna meet a girl who really loves me.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.157
Maybe she won't be what you call hot,
but I'll think she's beautiful.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.512
And I'll tell her so.

21:00.480 --> 21:04.473
I won't be mean to her because
I won't have to play games with her.

21:03.240 --> 21:05.470
I'll just be the guy
that she can always count on,

21:08.520 --> 21:10.192
and that'll be enough.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.189
And she'll be elite to me.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.672
- Are you okay?
- Not really.

21:18.280 --> 21:19.793
What are we doing?

21:20.600 --> 21:24.149
You know, you've been here three weeks,
Ellie, and all we've talked about is music

21:23.720 --> 21:27.030
and the CD and business.

21:31.520 --> 21:34.478
But it's not just
a business arrangement, is it?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.632
Of course not.

21:36.560 --> 21:39.358
I need you to talk to me
about your cancer.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.316
- It's okay.
- No.

21:44.320 --> 21:46.151
No, it's not okay.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.759
How can you just act
like nothing's wrong?

21:53.480 --> 21:56.392
Aren't you afraid?
Because I'm afraid for you.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.997
Don't be afraid, Peyton.

22:07.320 --> 22:10.995
Every song has a coda, a final movement.

22:09.800 --> 22:12.519
Whether it fades out or crashes away,

22:13.960 --> 22:15.951
every song ends.

22:21.120 --> 22:23.759
Is that any reason not to enjoy the music?

22:24.640 --> 22:27.598
But it doesn't mean
I can't want it to not end.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.959
Look at you.

22:31.560 --> 22:35.519
You've had more life-changing events
in the first 17 years of your life

22:33.720 --> 22:35.312
than I'd wish on anyone.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.670
You got the surviving part down.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.594
I want you to focus more on the living.

22:43.720 --> 22:46.439
Sometimes surviving
is about all the living I can handle.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.955
I don't buy that for one second.

22:49.880 --> 22:54.112
And if you keep this up,
hiding in your art and your sadness,

22:54.440 --> 22:56.271
you're really gonna miss out.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.517
Because the truth is,

23:02.520 --> 23:04.875
there is nothing to be afraid of.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.151
It's just life.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.234
Come on.

23:12.240 --> 23:14.800
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

23:14.600 --> 23:16.431
We are going into life.

23:17.880 --> 23:21.077
I really like that
you're telling me all these stories

23:22.440 --> 23:24.476
about how much you remember.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.233
It's kind of scary, though.
Now I have to be, like, super cute 24/7

23:28.200 --> 23:30.714
if it's gonna be embedded in your memory
for all of eternity.

23:32.960 --> 23:36.509
But I have to say
I kind of feel like we're cheating.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.754
We're not even really talking
about all the big issues.

23:38.440 --> 23:40.954
I was this close to getting away
with it, wasn't I?

23:41.360 --> 23:42.588
I don't want to ruin our evening.

23:43.960 --> 23:47.714
I just don't want to miss an opportunity
to, like, actually work things out.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.113
How do you know a fun night together

23:50.520 --> 23:52.317
isn't exactly what we need
to work things out?

23:53.880 --> 23:57.236
Or maybe a few fun nights, all in a row.
No trouble in between.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.998
- Yeah...
- I know. It's not in your nature.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.915
It's not really, and I'm sorry. I just...

24:01.240 --> 24:03.993
I can't help it. I have so many questions.

24:03.120 --> 24:05.588
Okay. Why did you call Chris?

24:06.560 --> 24:07.549
I told you.

24:09.760 --> 24:13.036
I asked Chris to come back and help you
with your music because you love it.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.396
- It's a huge part of who you are.
- I know, but Nathan,

24:19.520 --> 24:21.954
Chris? There were a million other people
you could've called.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.957
Why open that door again?

24:23.160 --> 24:26.311
Look, I called Chris because I screwed up

24:26.520 --> 24:28.795
and I wanted to try and fix it.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.632
Going to High Flyers made me realize

24:32.400 --> 24:34.994
how wrong I was to make you
choose between me and the tour.

24:36.760 --> 24:39.228
I mean, what is this, the 1950s?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.956
It didn't have to be either-or, you know?

24:42.600 --> 24:44.352
But it was, wasn't it?

24:44.440 --> 24:47.159
Because I didn't ask you to come with me.

24:47.120 --> 24:48.269
Nathan,

24:49.680 --> 24:52.831
when I look back on the tour,
I'm not, like, proud of it

24:51.720 --> 24:54.439
'cause I know
that you weren't proud of me.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.711
Is that what you think?
That I wasn't proud of you?

24:59.360 --> 25:01.749
Let me show you something.
It's in my car.

25:02.360 --> 25:04.032
Nathan, it's crazy out there.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.670
Nathan, what are you doing?

25:09.840 --> 25:12.957
I was hurt, Haley,
but I was still proud of you.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.119
Every day.

25:17.280 --> 25:20.636
- Wait, wait. It's all getting ruined.
- No, you don't need all that stuff.

25:30.480 --> 25:31.833
You've got me.

25:48.240 --> 25:49.719
This is crazy!

25:51.840 --> 25:53.478
This is alive.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.270
You really surprised me, Mouth.

26:00.480 --> 26:02.755
That speech was pretty impressive.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.557
I was just being honest.

26:37.560 --> 26:40.028
The last part would've worked better
as an exit line,

26:48.600 --> 26:50.431
but I've watched
enough hurricane coverage on CNN

26:51.160 --> 26:54.914
to know you're supposed to stay put
until you get the all clear.

26:53.520 --> 26:57.991
Then I guess we're stuck with each other,
and I'm pretty much all talked out.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.676
You got anything else to say?

26:58.280 --> 26:59.633
Not really.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.668
Well, we could kiss.

27:04.600 --> 27:05.715
Stop.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.713
I'm serious.

27:11.400 --> 27:14.039
It would pass the time. What do you say?

27:13.480 --> 27:15.072
We could do that.

27:19.480 --> 27:21.198
But I'm not going to.

27:20.920 --> 27:22.035
Good.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.829
You're learning. Play hard to get.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.475
No, it's not that. It's just...

27:32.320 --> 27:34.197
It's easier in the dark.

27:35.440 --> 27:38.000
But pretty soon the lights
are gonna come back on

27:36.800 --> 27:40.076
and we'll go back to being
who we really are, right?

27:39.200 --> 27:43.159
I mean, kissing might be, I don't know,
whatever to you,

27:43.160 --> 27:44.479
but to me, it'll mean something.

27:45.120 --> 27:48.112
And I'll wake up tomorrow
wanting to do it again

27:47.760 --> 27:50.832
and again and pretty much all the time.

27:53.440 --> 27:56.238
Somehow, I don't think
you'll feel the same.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.151
On the day that changes,

27:59.640 --> 28:02.438
on the day you wake up
and have to call me,

28:02.720 --> 28:04.358
then I'll kiss you.

28:07.040 --> 28:08.871
I guess that's my cue.

28:12.240 --> 28:15.232
- Mouth, wait...
- It's cool. I'll see you later.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.959
You know, that lemon meringue
was tomorrow's featured dessert.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.713
Well, not anymore.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.192
I love you, Keith.

28:27.960 --> 28:28.995
Got you.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.111
So, if you catch a cold,

28:47.920 --> 28:50.036
you can tell your father it's all on me.

28:58.760 --> 29:01.035
It'd be worth it. Tonight was amazing.

29:17.960 --> 29:19.313
Thank you.

29:24.960 --> 29:27.758
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

29:27.080 --> 29:28.559
This is nice.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.669
Yeah, it is.

29:31.920 --> 29:35.959
You know, I was thinking
about the stuff you said

29:39.640 --> 29:43.758
about living life,
and jumping at opportunity,

29:43.400 --> 29:44.992
not being afraid.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.268
Yeah?

29:49.320 --> 29:51.788
And there was this guy...

29:53.440 --> 29:55.351
There is this guy.

29:57.640 --> 30:00.074
A guy that I... I loved.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.511
And I let him go.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.276
And now I'm starting to think
that was a big mistake.

30:06.120 --> 30:07.712
But it's too late.

30:08.520 --> 30:09.635
No.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.350
It's never too late, Peyton.

30:13.560 --> 30:16.393
That's one thing I learned
from meeting you.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.194
I'm so sorry I missed those 17 years.

30:19.440 --> 30:22.830
But I wouldn't give back
these three weeks for the world.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.159
Yeah, me either.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.795
And the Peyton that I've come to know

30:32.160 --> 30:34.515
deserves to get whatever she wants.

30:37.360 --> 30:38.998
She deserves to be happy

30:40.840 --> 30:44.037
as an artist, as a friend,

30:43.280 --> 30:45.191
as a daughter.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.119
I heard that.

30:48.360 --> 30:49.554
Stop it.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.354
What?

30:55.360 --> 30:57.999
Whatever you're worrying about.
Just stop.

31:00.440 --> 31:03.876
How do you know I'm worried?
You didn't even open your eyes.

31:03.680 --> 31:07.275
You think I need to see you with my eyes
to know what's going on with you?

31:14.440 --> 31:16.078
What's on your mind?

31:16.400 --> 31:19.915
I just was wondering
if maybe I should go home.

31:17.760 --> 31:19.034
Why would you do that?

31:21.600 --> 31:25.309
Because I don't want to wake up
and have you not be here again.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.553
I'll be here.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.438
I'm not going anywhere.

31:33.640 --> 31:35.073
Come here.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.674
Every great song ends sometime, right?

31:40.520 --> 31:42.590
Call me when you get the CD.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.679
I'll come see you.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.951
We can listen to it together.

31:50.680 --> 31:51.874
Sure.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.477
I don't want you to go.

32:18.040 --> 32:21.999
Sweetie, those words
are gonna break my heart.

32:19.760 --> 32:22.274
We will see each other again someday.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.113
I promise.

32:23.880 --> 32:24.915
Nathan...

32:28.400 --> 32:31.437
Haley, I told you the tour
was a really big part of your life.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.952
You deserve to have something
to remember it by,

32:40.560 --> 32:42.437
besides all the bad memories.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.674
Thank you.

32:59.880 --> 33:01.950
What are we gonna do about college?

33:23.000 --> 33:24.718
We'll apply to both,

33:24.120 --> 33:26.156
and we'll just wait and see.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.388
Hey, you.

33:33.440 --> 33:35.158
I haven't seen you in a couple of days.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.719
I know. It's been crazy.
How have you been?

33:43.240 --> 33:45.754
I just want to make sure
that everything's cool.

33:46.360 --> 33:48.078
You know, after what happened
at my house.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.196
Listen, girls are always trying to kiss me.

33:57.320 --> 33:59.356
Sometimes cheerleaders, mostly models.

33:58.640 --> 34:00.790
It happens. It's no big deal.
I don't blame you.

34:00.440 --> 34:03.716
In fact, I got an hour to kill later on,
so if you want...

34:03.920 --> 34:05.273
Stop it.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.715
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said.

34:08.320 --> 34:11.596
About being mean to girls,
and I want you to know

34:10.440 --> 34:12.670
those sweatpants
really make your butt look big.

34:12.560 --> 34:14.072
- Mouth!
- I'm sorry.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.670
I thought I'd give it a shot,
but who am I kidding?

34:18.960 --> 34:21.996
Your butt looks great.
I mean, not that I noticed.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.509
Sorry.

34:23.639 --> 34:26.438
Hey, rule number one: Never apologize.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.797
- I thought we talked about that.
- You're right. Sorry.

34:30.159 --> 34:31.353
Ellie?

34:31.760 --> 34:33.431
Hey, I got the CDs.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.558
They look awesome.

34:37.239 --> 34:38.355
Ellie?

34:38.480 --> 34:40.710
This is kind of personal. Do you mind?

34:41.360 --> 34:42.998
Of course. My apologies.

36:59.840 --> 37:01.876
Just let me know
when you're finished, Mr. Mayor.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.078
Say hi to my mom,

37:06.800 --> 37:07.869
Mom.

37:12.200 --> 37:13.269
English
