00:15.133 --> 00:18.800
Hello there.
It is I, your cute
yet majestic

00:18.800 --> 00:21.767
butterfly friend
Grover. Ha ha ha!

00:21.767 --> 00:25.633
Today, we are going to learn
all about butterflies.

00:25.633 --> 00:28.533
Yes. Butterflies
are so graceful,

00:28.533 --> 00:32.734
the way they flutter about
and--oh--smell pretty flowers.

00:34.133 --> 00:36.433
Ahh, yes. Butterflies,
you see--oh, oh, dear.

00:36.433 --> 00:38.333
Oh, my. Oh! Oh, no!

00:38.333 --> 00:41.000
What--oh--aah! Ohh.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.166
Let us learn more about
butterflies on "Sesame Street."

Sesame Street!

01:17.967 --> 01:19.467
Elmo:
Ha ha ha!

01:19.467 --> 01:23.967
- Oh, hi. Hi, everybody.
- Hey, Lucas! Hey, Eli!

01:23.967 --> 01:26.633
- Hi, Mr. Andre.
- Hee hee!

01:26.633 --> 01:28.233
- Hey, Elmo.
What, what, what?

01:28.233 --> 01:29.967
Oh! Oh! Oh, look.
Look who's here.

01:29.967 --> 01:30.967
Look, look.

01:30.967 --> 01:34.300
Oh. Hey. Welcome
to Sesame Street.

01:34.300 --> 01:36.667
- We're looking at bugs.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:36.667 --> 01:39.000
Ooh. Elmo has his
magnifying glass.

01:40.266 --> 01:41.834
And I've got
this great book,

01:41.834 --> 01:45.433
"Fascinating Facts
About Insects."

01:45.433 --> 01:47.433
Let's go and see
if we can find some insects.

01:47.433 --> 01:50.233
- Insects! Yes!
- Insects! Let's see.

01:50.233 --> 01:52.467
Oh, oh! Telly, look!

01:52.467 --> 01:53.633
- Ants!

01:53.633 --> 01:56.633
- Ants are insects.
- Yeah!

01:56.633 --> 02:00.934
Yeah. Ooh. There's 1, 2
little ants playing together.

02:00.934 --> 02:02.300
It says here--

02:02.300 --> 02:03.800
- Oh, wow!

02:03.800 --> 02:06.066
"Ants never sleep."

02:06.066 --> 02:07.967
- Wow.
- Wow! Ha ha!

02:07.967 --> 02:09.734
And they don't
even look tired.

02:09.734 --> 02:12.000
Both:
Fascinating!

02:12.000 --> 02:14.934
Oh, look!
More bugs, Telly!
More bugs!

02:14.934 --> 02:16.667
Look at that!
What are they?

02:16.667 --> 02:17.867
What, what?
Elmo

02:17.867 --> 02:20.433
Those are ladybugs.

02:20.433 --> 02:23.800
1, 2 ladybugs
playing together.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.367
- Wow.
- Yeah.

02:25.367 --> 02:27.633
Here's a fascinating
fact about ladybugs.

02:27.633 --> 02:28.834
OK, Telly.

02:28.834 --> 02:31.700
They smell
with their feet.

02:31.700 --> 02:34.400
Both:
Fascinating!

02:34.400 --> 02:36.800
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Elmo sees another bug!
- Whoa!

02:36.800 --> 02:39.633
Ha ha ha!
Ooh! Hey, Telly. Look, look.

02:39.633 --> 02:41.633
There's a butterfly.

02:41.633 --> 02:43.266
Whoa. He's beautiful.

02:43.266 --> 02:45.600
Yeah, but where's
butterfly's friend?

02:45.600 --> 02:49.033
Elmo and Telly saw, um,
2 little ants

02:49.033 --> 02:51.700
and 2 little, uh, ladybugs,

02:51.700 --> 02:55.633
but there's only
1 butterfly, and it's alone.

02:55.633 --> 02:59.734
You're right. Let's look
for another butterfly.

02:59.734 --> 03:01.900
OK! Ha ha ha!

03:01.900 --> 03:05.800
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!
Other butterfly?

03:05.800 --> 03:09.133
Come out,
come out, wherever you are.

03:09.133 --> 03:11.333
Calling all butterflies!

03:11.333 --> 03:13.166
Butterflies,
where are you?

03:13.166 --> 03:15.000
- Hmm.
- Oh, boy.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.633
Telly, Elmo doesn't think any
other butterflies are around.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.033
Yeah. I don't
think so either.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.734
That little guy has no
butterfly friend to play with.

03:23.734 --> 03:25.934
- Elmo can be a butterfly!

03:25.934 --> 03:29.200
Elmo--Elmo will pretend
to be a butterfly, Telly.

03:29.200 --> 03:32.066
Then the little butterfly
will have a friend to play with.

03:32.066 --> 03:33.867
Great idea!

03:33.867 --> 03:35.967
OK, OK. Um, let's see. Oh.

03:35.967 --> 03:37.266
Flutter, flutter, flutter,
flutter.

03:37.266 --> 03:38.800
Flutter, flutter,
flutter, flutter.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.200
- Elmo's a butterfly!
- Yep.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.133
Flutter, flutter,
flutter, flutter.
Come play with Elmo.

03:42.133 --> 03:44.734
Oh, oh. It's not working.

03:44.734 --> 03:47.500
The butterfly's not
coming over to play.

03:47.500 --> 03:50.100
Hmm. I don't
think he gets that
you're a butterfly, Elmo.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.934
- I'm checking the book here.

03:52.934 --> 03:55.266
Ah! Here's
something fascinating.

03:55.266 --> 03:58.000
Before a butterfly can become
a butterfly,

03:58.000 --> 04:00.834
it has to go
through a metamorphosis.

04:00.834 --> 04:02.100
A what?

04:02.100 --> 04:05.500
Metamorphosis is--
is a big change.

04:05.500 --> 04:09.667
It says here, "There are
4 very different stages

04:09.667 --> 04:11.133
in the life
of a butterfly."

04:11.133 --> 04:12.800
What does that
have to do with Elmo?

04:12.800 --> 04:15.467
Well, maybe if you--
if you pretend...

04:15.467 --> 04:17.433
- to go through
those 4 stages...

04:17.433 --> 04:19.900
the butterfly will think
that you're a butterfly

04:19.900 --> 04:21.400
and want to
be your friend.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.066
Hey. That's
a great idea, Telly!

04:23.066 --> 04:24.767
Ooh! What's the first
stage

04:24.767 --> 04:30.000
"First a butterfly starts
as a butterfly egg," like this.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.567
Got it! Elmo will be
right back! Ha ha!

04:32.567 --> 04:33.900
Ta-da!

04:33.900 --> 04:36.033
Nice egg costume, Elmo.

04:36.033 --> 04:37.500
Hee hee!
Well, thank you, Telly,

04:37.500 --> 04:40.033
but Elmo's not Elmo anymore.

04:40.033 --> 04:42.066
Elmo's butterfly egg Elmo.

04:42.066 --> 04:43.367
Oh, right.
Right, right.

04:43.367 --> 04:47.734
And-- And look,
butterfly egg Elmo.
It's working!

04:47.734 --> 04:49.867
The butterfly
is looking right at you.

04:49.867 --> 04:51.600
Oh. Not anymore.

04:51.600 --> 04:55.266
Ooh. Quick, Telly,
what's the second stage?

04:55.266 --> 04:58.734
You need to pretend
to be a caterpillar.

04:58.734 --> 05:01.000
The butterfly
starts as an egg,

05:01.000 --> 05:05.033
and when the egg hatches,
a caterpillar comes out.

05:05.033 --> 05:06.700
Elmo will be right back.

05:06.700 --> 05:09.600
Hee hee! Ha ha! Mmm!

05:09.600 --> 05:11.633
Ha ha! Elmo's a caterpillar!

05:11.633 --> 05:14.300
And look, look!
It's working!

05:14.300 --> 05:16.533
The butterfly is
flying right to you.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.567
Is he ready to be your friend?

05:18.567 --> 05:21.333
Oh. Oh, no. Not yet. Oh.

05:21.333 --> 05:22.867
What's the third stage, Telly?

05:22.867 --> 05:24.767
Oh. Let's see.

05:24.767 --> 05:27.333
"After the egg hatches
into a caterpillar,

05:27.333 --> 05:29.867
it grows and sheds
its skin,

05:29.867 --> 05:32.233
and when it does it
for the last time,

05:32.233 --> 05:33.934
it forms a chrysalis."

05:33.934 --> 05:37.567
Oh. It looks like
a tiny sleeping bag.

05:37.567 --> 05:39.934
OK, Telly. Be right back.

05:39.934 --> 05:41.633
Hee hee hee!

05:41.633 --> 05:43.500
Hee hee hee!

05:43.500 --> 05:45.467
Ooh! Elmo's a chrysalis. Ha ha!

05:45.467 --> 05:48.100
Hey, look.
It's working, it's working!

05:48.100 --> 05:50.500
The butterfly, it's
flying all around you.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.433
Wow! Yeah, yea-- Uh-oh.

05:52.433 --> 05:56.533
But the butterfly isn't
ready to be Elmo's friend yet.

05:56.533 --> 05:59.934
That's because you need
to go through the fourth stage.

05:59.934 --> 06:02.600
Inside the chrysalis,
the caterpillar

06:02.600 --> 06:04.967
turns into a butterfly.

06:04.967 --> 06:07.166
Elmo thought
that would come next. Uh!

06:11.500 --> 06:13.333
What?! Ha ha ha!

06:13.333 --> 06:15.667
Whoa! Ta-da!

06:15.667 --> 06:18.433
Elmo is Elmo butterfly!

06:18.433 --> 06:20.800
You really
do look like a butterfly!

06:20.800 --> 06:22.233
Ah, thank you, Telly.

06:22.233 --> 06:24.100
And look, look!
It's working!

06:24.100 --> 06:27.367
The butterfly wants
to be your friend.

06:27.367 --> 06:29.033
Hello, butterfly.

06:29.033 --> 06:30.834
Elmo, you did it.

06:30.834 --> 06:32.734
The butterfly's
not lonely anymore!

06:32.734 --> 06:34.800
He's got a new friend.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.166
And Elmo's got
a new friend, too.

06:38.166 --> 06:41.633
Come on, little butterfly.
Let's be butterflies together.

06:41.633 --> 06:43.133
Ooh! You, too!

06:43.133 --> 06:45.433
Flap, flutter,
and fly with us.

06:45.433 --> 06:46.700

Ooh! Oh, great fluttering,
little butterfly.

08:04.934 --> 08:07.467
Ooh! And you, too!
Ha ha ha!

08:07.467 --> 08:10.633
I think your little
butterfly friend is
all fluttered out, Elmo.

08:10.633 --> 08:12.633
Yeah, Elmo, too.
Ha ha ha!

08:12.633 --> 08:13.900
Come on.

08:13.900 --> 08:16.567
- Elmo: Chris, Chris!
- Hey, guys. Hey!

08:16.567 --> 08:18.900
- Ohh! Hey, Telly.
- Telly: Hi, Chris.

08:18.900 --> 08:22.166
!
- No. Butterfly Elmo.

08:22.166 --> 08:23.400
You noticed. Ha ha!

08:23.400 --> 08:25.834
This is Elmo's
butterfly friend. Ooh.

08:25.834 --> 08:27.233
Say hello to Chris, butterfly.

08:27.233 --> 08:29.433
Hello. Hey, hey.

08:29.433 --> 08:31.233
Did he just land on my head?

08:31.233 --> 08:32.934
- Ha ha ha!
- Yep.

08:32.934 --> 08:36.767
Oh, OK. Um, oh, OK. Uh,
what can I do for you guys?

08:36.767 --> 08:39.100
Butterfly Elmo
wants to draw a picture

08:39.100 --> 08:40.567
of his butterfly friend.

08:40.567 --> 08:41.934
I have just the thing.

08:41.934 --> 08:44.900
I have some paper
and some crayons, huh?

08:44.900 --> 08:47.066
Oh, good, good!
Thanks, Chris!

08:47.066 --> 08:48.367
- No problem.
- Come on, Telly.

08:48.367 --> 08:50.433
Let's go! Oh, you, too,
butterfly friend.

08:50.433 --> 08:51.500
Ha ha ha!

08:51.500 --> 08:52.867
- Hey, Elmo!

08:52.867 --> 08:55.500
The book says
that's a monarch butterfly.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.500
Wow! A monarch?

08:57.500 --> 08:58.734
That's what you call
a butterfly

08:58.734 --> 09:03.600
with "orange wings with
black lines and white spots."

09:03.600 --> 09:05.767
Cool. Well, Elmo's
best friends

09:05.767 --> 09:07.834
with a monarch butterfly.

09:07.834 --> 09:10.667
Ooh! Oh.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.700
Oh, ho ho ho! Look, look, look!

09:12.700 --> 09:14.333
I think
he liked your picture.

09:14.333 --> 09:17.033
Oh, yeah. Yay,
little butterfly friend!

09:17.033 --> 09:19.967
There is no other butterfly
quite like you. Ha ha.

09:21.533 --> 09:23.433
Uh, except
maybe that one.

09:23.433 --> 09:25.667
Chris: Hey!
It's another monarch!

09:25.667 --> 09:28.700
Ooh! And that one!

09:28.700 --> 09:31.000
And that one...
and that one!

09:31.000 --> 09:32.800
I wonder what's
going on here.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.066
Why are those
little butterflies here?

09:35.066 --> 09:39.734
"Monarch butterflies
get together to migrate."

09:39.734 --> 09:42.567
Migrate means
they move because
of the change in seasons.

09:42.567 --> 09:44.266
Yeah. It's just
too cold here in the winter.

09:45.533 --> 09:48.900
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

09:48.900 --> 09:50.433
There they go!

09:50.433 --> 09:53.500
Elmo's butterfly
friend wouldn't leave Elmo.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.367
We're best friends,
right, butterfly friend?

09:58.500 --> 10:00.133
Oh. Oh, no!
But--but--

10:00.133 --> 10:02.867
He-- He didn't
even say good-bye.

10:02.867 --> 10:04.967
He forgot all about Elmo.

10:04.967 --> 10:06.600
Telly:
Maybe not!

10:06.600 --> 10:11.300
Look! He came back
to say good-bye to you.

10:11.300 --> 10:13.667
- Elmo: Aw.
- Wow!

10:13.667 --> 10:16.433
Aw. Aw.

10:16.433 --> 10:20.266
Good-bye, little butterfly
friend, and don't worry.

10:20.266 --> 10:22.333
Elmo understands.

10:22.333 --> 10:26.233
Elmo will always have
this picture

10:26.233 --> 10:28.100
to remember you by.

10:29.266 --> 10:30.767
Aw.

10:30.767 --> 10:31.900
What?

10:31.900 --> 10:34.433
Good-bye,
little butterfly friend.

10:34.433 --> 10:37.967
Come on! Let's find out more
fascinating facts about bugs.

10:37.967 --> 10:39.000
- Come on.
- All right!

10:39.000 --> 10:41.233
- OK. Listen to this.

10:41.233 --> 10:44.400
Dragonflies are
the fastest flying bugs of all,

10:44.400 --> 10:47.033
and they can eat
while flying.

10:47.033 --> 10:48.266
Elmo:
Really? Cool!

10:48.266 --> 10:50.934

"B" is for butterflies.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.600
Butterflies are insects.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.767
They have 6 legs,
2 antennae,

11:53.767 --> 11:55.900
and 2 pairs of wings.

11:55.900 --> 11:58.133
Butterflies go
through a metamorphosis,

11:58.133 --> 11:59.734
or a really big change.

11:59.734 --> 12:02.400
They begin their lives
as caterpillars.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.233
When they're fully grown,
they spin themselves

12:05.233 --> 12:06.867
into a chrysalis.

12:06.867 --> 12:11.133
After some time passes,
it turns into a butterfly.

12:11.133 --> 12:12.100
Wow!

12:13.567 --> 12:15.367
Butterflies
only eat liquids

12:15.367 --> 12:18.900
like flower nectar and sap
from flowers on trees.

12:18.900 --> 12:22.834
They also drink juice
from fruits.

12:22.834 --> 12:25.734
Butterflies' wings have
bright colors and patterns

12:25.734 --> 12:27.533
to help them
do lots of things--

12:27.533 --> 12:29.233
like camouflage.

12:29.233 --> 12:32.066
This butterfly looks
just like the tree.

12:33.233 --> 12:35.133
Wow!

12:35.133 --> 12:37.333
"B" is for butterflies.

12:37.333 --> 12:40.000
The letter "B."

13:15.233 --> 13:16.734
- Hee hee hee!

13:16.734 --> 13:18.166
Where'd she go?

13:18.166 --> 13:20.700
- Aah!
- Whoa! Ha ha ha!

13:20.700 --> 13:23.367
- Hi, Ovejita!
- Hola,  Murray!

13:23.367 --> 13:25.967
What school
are we going to today?

13:25.967 --> 13:28.533
- Ta-da!
- Ooh!

13:28.533 --> 13:30.266
What is this?

13:30.266 --> 13:31.867
Kids:
A flower!

13:31.867 --> 13:35.467
Yeah, a flower.
And where does a flower grow?

13:35.467 --> 13:36.967
Kids:
A garden!

13:36.967 --> 13:39.100
Yes. I think I know
where we're going.

13:39.100 --> 13:41.400
We're going to...

13:41.400 --> 13:44.300
All:
Gardening school!

13:44.300 --> 13:46.934
Escuela de jardinera.

13:46.934 --> 13:49.533
All: Yay!

13:59.100 --> 14:00.900
Murray:
What happens
in this garden?

14:00.900 --> 14:02.767
Generally, in a garden
like this one,

14:02.767 --> 14:04.834
- we grow things
that look pretty.
- Uh-huh.

14:04.834 --> 14:07.967
And sometimes things that
look pretty are also things
that you can eat.

14:07.967 --> 14:09.100
Wait a minute. Spinach.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.467
Spinach has leaves.
Can they grow in the garden?

14:11.467 --> 14:12.734
- Yes.
- Wow!

14:12.734 --> 14:14.200
Man: Are you ready to
plant some seeds?

14:14.200 --> 14:16.367
- Girl: I see something.
- Just like that.

14:17.734 --> 14:19.333
- I like flowers.
- Yeah, me too.

14:21.066 --> 14:23.600
Oh! Que bonita.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.667
Murray:
What color

14:24.667 --> 14:25.900
do flowers come in?

14:25.900 --> 14:27.734
- White...

14:27.734 --> 14:29.100
- Pink...
- Pink.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.667
- Red...
- Red.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.233
- And purple.

14:32.233 --> 14:33.667
And how about my
favorite color of all?

14:33.667 --> 14:35.500
- An orange flower.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.700
Well, right now, we don't
have any orange flowers--

14:37.700 --> 14:39.533
Aw, man. Maybe I could
just stand there like this

14:39.533 --> 14:40.967
and pretend to be
the orange flower.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.233
How do you plant a flower?

14:43.233 --> 14:46.900
You use seeds
and water and sunshine.

14:46.900 --> 14:48.967
That's so much stuff
a flower needs.

14:48.967 --> 14:51.266
I thought you just put it
there and it just grows.

14:51.266 --> 14:53.000
- That's--no, no.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.533
So what do I do first
when I'm gonna plant?

14:54.533 --> 14:56.500
We want to rake off
any debris, any bits

14:56.500 --> 14:58.467
of old plant or petals.

14:58.467 --> 15:00.333
We want to make sure
the soil looks nice and clean.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.633
So here's what
we're going to do.

15:01.633 --> 15:03.166
When we plant, we're
going to use this.

15:03.166 --> 15:04.667
This is a trowel.
Does everybody know
what a trowel is?

15:04.667 --> 15:06.367
- Kid: Shovel!
- Man: It is!

15:06.367 --> 15:08.066
It's like a really
small shovel.

15:08.066 --> 15:10.533
Now, they're not very big,
but they are kind of heavy,

15:10.533 --> 15:12.233
so you do have to
be careful, OK?

15:12.233 --> 15:13.834
Just like sugar on a spoon.

15:13.834 --> 15:16.367
Put it right
next to the hole.
Perfect.

15:16.367 --> 15:17.900
Murray: Kareem, I'm really
good at digging.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.166
Watch my digging moves.

15:19.166 --> 15:20.400
- OK.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.934
Ugh, ah!

15:21.934 --> 15:23.900
Ugh, ah!
Ugh, ah!

15:23.900 --> 15:25.767
- You think I'm gonna
be good at digging?
- Yes.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.033
Man: Once we get the plants
in the ground,

15:38.033 --> 15:39.300
what else do they need?

15:39.300 --> 15:41.533
Um...uh...company?

15:41.533 --> 15:43.700
Uh, no.
Well, they do like company.

15:43.700 --> 15:46.133
- They need water.

15:46.133 --> 15:49.533
Get all of those roots
nice and wet.

15:50.834 --> 15:52.333
Hit it, Ovejita!

15:52.333 --> 15:53.667
Mm-hmm.

15:56.133 --> 15:59.033
Woman: Just press lightly,
and you got it.

15:59.033 --> 16:01.767
Wow! There's so
much stuff that comes
out of a garden.

16:04.233 --> 16:05.734
Hee hee hee hee!
Mm-hmm.

16:09.233 --> 16:12.166
I love gardening school!

16:12.166 --> 16:14.600
Hee hee hee! Escuela!

16:14.600 --> 16:16.633
See you next
time at school!

16:16.633 --> 16:18.166
- Adios!
- Bye!

16:18.166 --> 16:19.400
Hee hee hee!

16:21.066 --> 16:23.533
Greetings,
all you nature lovers.

16:23.533 --> 16:25.667
This is your cute, furry, blue,

16:25.667 --> 16:28.767
and green-thumbed
gardening monster Grover--

16:28.767 --> 16:31.667
heh heh heh--and today
I am going to tell you

16:31.667 --> 16:35.367
about the things that all cute,
little plants need

16:35.367 --> 16:38.033
to grow and stay healthy.

16:38.033 --> 16:40.433
Mm-hmm. Oh, first,
they need soil and sunlight,

16:40.433 --> 16:43.266
which this plant over here
already has plenty of,

16:43.266 --> 16:46.266
but a plant also needs to eat.

16:46.266 --> 16:48.166
OK, little planty.

16:48.166 --> 16:51.667
I hope you're hungry, because,
oh, have I got a treat for you.

16:51.667 --> 16:55.300
Something that all little plants
love, and that is...

16:57.433 --> 17:02.333
a big, healthful salad
with radishes and tomatoes--

17:02.333 --> 17:04.533
oh!--and just a hint
of oregano.

17:04.533 --> 17:06.767
Bon appetit.

17:06.767 --> 17:08.600
Do not wait for me.
I have already eaten.

17:08.600 --> 17:11.367
Wha--um...

17:11.367 --> 17:16.033
It appears, uh, this plant is
not of the salad-eating variety,

17:16.033 --> 17:17.667
but fear not.

17:17.667 --> 17:21.467
I know what else a little plant
needs to grow big and healthy--

17:21.467 --> 17:22.800
heh heh--

17:24.567 --> 17:26.166
A pizza!

17:26.166 --> 17:29.233
Ohh! Oh, piping hot,
fresh out of the oven.

17:29.233 --> 17:32.066
Wha-- Oh, dear.

17:32.066 --> 17:35.200
This little plant does not seem
to be a pizza eater, either.

17:35.200 --> 17:39.100
But being the resourceful
gardening monster that I am,

17:39.100 --> 17:43.000
I know just the thing that
no little plant can resist--

17:45.233 --> 17:47.567
Hungarian goulash.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.000
Ha ha ha! Oh, enjoy.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.667
Do not resist.
Give in to temptation.

17:54.934 --> 17:57.333
Or not. Ohh...

17:57.333 --> 18:00.133
- - Oy gevalt!

18:00.133 --> 18:03.467
I cannot believe. This little
plant is one finicky eater.

18:03.467 --> 18:08.367
Oh! And how will it ever grow
to be big and healthy

18:08.367 --> 18:10.033
and green and--
and now it is raining.

18:10.033 --> 18:16.934
Oh, the weather report
did not forecast rain today.

18:16.934 --> 18:18.533
But look!

18:18.533 --> 18:23.700
Oh, the--the little plant is
looking nice and healthy again.

18:23.700 --> 18:27.367
Ah! Huh.
I guess all it needed
was a little water.

18:27.367 --> 18:28.834
Ha ha! Ha!

18:28.834 --> 18:31.500
Uh, uh, uh...

18:31.500 --> 18:34.767
And I guess what I really need
right now is an umbrella.

18:34.767 --> 18:37.667
Uh, uh, uh...

18:37.667 --> 18:40.000
Uh, excuse me.

20:32.166 --> 20:35.800
Hi! Welcome to
Elmo's World!

20:35.800 --> 20:40.066
Oh! Guess what Elmo is
wondering about today.

20:40.066 --> 20:42.066
Wait for it.

20:42.066 --> 20:44.867
Wai-ai-ait for it.

20:44.867 --> 20:49.567
Oh, ho ho ho!
Butterflies!

20:49.567 --> 20:52.667
Oh, hi, butterflies.
Ha ha hee hee!

20:52.667 --> 20:54.967
Boy, Elmo loves butterflies

20:54.967 --> 20:57.800
and wants to find out
more about them.

20:57.800 --> 21:01.400
Hey! Let's ask
our friend Smartie.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.066
Let's call her together.

21:03.066 --> 21:05.433
Elmo and kids:
♪ Oh, Smartie ♪

21:05.433 --> 21:07.200
( Smartie playing
"Elmo's Song" )

21:07.200 --> 21:08.467
Ha ha ha!

21:08.467 --> 21:10.200
- Hiya, Elmo!
- Hi, Smartie!

21:10.200 --> 21:14.233
Look at me!
I'm floating
like a butterfly!

21:14.233 --> 21:16.600
Oh, ho ho ho! Pretty!

21:16.600 --> 21:18.533
Oh. That's perfect, Smartie,

21:18.533 --> 21:21.734
because Elmo wants to learn
all about butterflies today.

21:21.734 --> 21:24.900
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:24.900 --> 21:28.200
All:
We look it up!

21:28.200 --> 21:31.066
Searching the 'net
for butterflies.

21:31.066 --> 21:33.300
Here we go!

21:33.300 --> 21:35.700
Butterflies start out
as caterpillars.

21:35.700 --> 21:37.767
The caterpillar builds
a chrysalis

21:37.767 --> 21:39.133
all around itself.

21:39.133 --> 21:41.834
Inside the chrysalis,
the caterpillar goes

21:41.834 --> 21:46.834
through a metamorphosis,
a big change...

21:46.834 --> 21:49.934
and turns
into a butterfly.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.567
Butterflies are insects
with 6 legs,

21:52.567 --> 21:55.667
2 antennae,
and 2 pairs of wings.

21:55.667 --> 21:59.433
For food, butterflies drink
nectar from flowers

21:59.433 --> 22:01.667
and juice from some fruits.

22:03.367 --> 22:05.600
Boy, that was
cool, Smartie!

22:05.600 --> 22:08.767
Well, I "butter" fly.
Get it?

22:08.767 --> 22:10.633
- "Better fly," "butterfly."
- Right, right!

22:10.633 --> 22:13.433
- Butterfly! Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

22:13.433 --> 22:15.734
- Oh.
- Catch you later, Elmo.

22:15.734 --> 22:19.166
Oh, ho ho!
Bye-bye, Smartie!

22:19.166 --> 22:20.734
Ha ha ha!

22:20.734 --> 22:24.633
Hey! That gives
Elmo an idea.

22:24.633 --> 22:27.266
Oh, ho! Let's play
a game together.

22:27.266 --> 22:29.600
Yeah-eah-eah!
Come on, come on!

22:29.600 --> 22:30.700
Ha ha ha!

22:33.433 --> 22:34.834
Ha ha! Ha ha ha!

22:36.900 --> 22:38.433
Let's help the butterfly

22:38.433 --> 22:41.266
get to the flower for lunch.

22:41.266 --> 22:43.700
Are you ready? Let's play!

22:43.700 --> 22:48.000
Ready, butterfly? OK. Go!

22:48.000 --> 22:50.233
Girl:
Uh-oh! He's stuck.

22:50.233 --> 22:53.567
Elmo: Oh, no. The butterfly
took a wrong turn.

22:53.567 --> 22:55.834
Boy:
Go back the way you came!

22:55.834 --> 22:58.233
That's it!

22:58.233 --> 22:59.900
Elmo:
Keep going, butterfly.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.433
Girl:
Keep going!

23:01.433 --> 23:04.266
Elmo:
Oh, no! You went too far.

23:04.266 --> 23:06.533
Girl:
Go back, butterfly.

23:06.533 --> 23:08.767
Boy:
Don't miss the turn.

23:08.767 --> 23:10.567
Elmo:
Keep going, butterfly.

23:10.567 --> 23:12.800
Girl:
You're almost there!

23:12.800 --> 23:14.233
Girl #2:
That's it!

23:14.233 --> 23:15.633
Elmo: Good job!

23:15.633 --> 23:18.333
We helped the butterfly
get to the flower.

23:18.333 --> 23:20.066
Boy:
Yay! We did it!

23:20.066 --> 23:21.166
Yeah, baby!

23:21.166 --> 23:24.800
Wow. Elmo really loves
butterflies--oh--

23:24.800 --> 23:28.033
and that makes Elmo wonder
even more.

23:28.033 --> 23:30.967
Ooh. Does Mr. Noodle know
about butterflies?

23:30.967 --> 23:33.333
Oh. Let's ask him.
Ha ha ha!

23:33.333 --> 23:35.900
♪ Hey, Mr. Noodle ♪

23:35.900 --> 23:37.166
Oh, ho ho!

23:37.166 --> 23:40.667

Mr. Noodle.

23:40.667 --> 23:42.567
Hi, Mr. Noodle.

23:42.567 --> 23:45.166
Oh. Mr. Noodle,
Elmo was wondering

23:45.166 --> 23:47.533
do you know about butterflies?

23:47.533 --> 23:52.133
You do? Oh!
Show us a butterfly,
Mr. Noodle.

23:52.133 --> 23:55.100
Kids:
Yeah! Show us!

23:55.100 --> 23:58.133
Kid: Ha ha! Mr. Noodle,
that's butter.

23:58.133 --> 24:01.300
Elmo: That's butter!
Oh, ho ho!

24:01.300 --> 24:03.233
What are you doin-- No!

24:03.233 --> 24:06.667
Mr. Noodle,
show us a butterfly,

24:06.667 --> 24:09.033
not butter that flies.

24:09.033 --> 24:11.600
OK. Elmo will give
you a hint.

24:11.600 --> 24:15.133
A butterfly has
2 antennae, yeah,

24:15.133 --> 24:17.667
and 4 wings.

24:17.667 --> 24:19.333
Yeah, that's right!

24:21.100 --> 24:22.800
Kid:
Where did he go?

24:22.800 --> 24:24.033
Oh, ho ho ho!

24:24.033 --> 24:25.667
Elmo and kids:
Mr. Noodle!

24:25.667 --> 24:27.934
Girl: You're dressed up
like a flower.

24:27.934 --> 24:29.734
Girl #2:
Wait, look!

24:29.734 --> 24:31.166
Kids: Wow!

24:31.166 --> 24:33.066
Boy: Look at all
the butterflies.

24:33.066 --> 24:35.433
Elmo:
Butterflies love flowers.

24:35.433 --> 24:39.033
Great job showing us
butterflies, Mr. Noodle.

24:39.033 --> 24:42.367
