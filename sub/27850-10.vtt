WEBVTT

00:08.349 --> 00:10.087
DIRECTOR MUELLER, YOU WERE

00:10.154 --> 00:13.724
ACTUALLY UNABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT

00:13.791 --> 00:14.325
THE PRESIDENT DID NOT COMMIT

00:14.391 --> 00:15.602
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, IS THAT

00:15.626 --> 00:16.026
CORRECT?

00:16.093 --> 00:18.796
WE AT THE OUTSET DETERMINED

00:18.862 --> 00:21.098
THAT WE, UH, WHEN IT CAME TO

00:21.165 --> 00:22.299
THE, UH ‐‐

00:22.366 --> 00:25.636
I REFER YOU TO THE, UH, THE

00:25.703 --> 00:26.070
REPORT.

00:26.136 --> 00:29.707
YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED MY

00:29.773 --> 00:29.974
QUESTION.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.308
I CORREDIRECT YOU TO THE REP

00:31.375 --> 00:33.277
FOR HOW THAT IS CHARACTERIZED.

00:33.344 --> 00:37.314
I FOUND DIRECTOR MUELLER

00:37.381 --> 00:39.750
DISHEVELED, FREQUENTLY CONFUSED

00:39.817 --> 00:45.823
AND HIGHLY EVASE SAVIF.

00:45.889 --> 00:47.124
BOB MUELLER WAS NOT THE

00:47.191 --> 00:49.526
WITNESS THAT THEY WERE HOPING

00:49.593 --> 00:49.693
FOR.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.428
WHAT YOU SAW IS ROM SUCKING

00:51.495 --> 00:54.798
THE LIFE OUT OF THE IMPEACHMENT

00:54.865 --> 00:55.299
MOVEMENT ALL TOGETHER.

00:55.366 --> 00:57.067
IMPEACHMENT NO LONGER APPEARS

00:57.134 --> 00:59.403
TO BE A LIVE OPTION.

00:59.470 --> 01:01.338
DEMOCRATS ARE BEING FORCED TO

01:01.405 --> 01:04.641
CONFRONT THAT THE ONLY WAY TO

01:04.708 --> 01:06.076
BEAT TRUMP MAY BE AT THE BALLOT

01:06.143 --> 01:06.377
BOX.

01:06.443 --> 01:10.080
THIS WAS A DEVASTATING DAY

01:10.147 --> 01:13.917
FOR THE DEMOCRATS.

01:13.984 --> 01:16.086
THE CONVERSATION WAS ABSOLUTELY

01:16.153 --> 01:18.055
PERFECT.

01:18.122 --> 01:18.555
ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE.

01:18.622 --> 01:21.458
IT WAS FRIENDLY, IT WAS WARM.

01:21.525 --> 01:24.461
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN BETTER.

01:24.528 --> 01:25.262
TOTALLY APPROPRIATE

01:25.329 --> 01:25.596
CONVERSATION.

01:25.663 --> 01:26.964
AND THERE WAS NO PRESSURE.

01:27.031 --> 01:27.464
NO NOTHING.

01:27.531 --> 01:29.033
AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY A

01:29.099 --> 01:31.735
BEAUTIFUL CONVERSATION.

01:31.802 --> 01:33.804
24 HOURS AFTER ROBERT MUELLER

01:33.871 --> 01:35.739
COMPLETED HIS TESTIMONY ON THE

01:35.806 --> 01:36.140
HILL.

01:36.206 --> 01:38.776
THE DAY AFTER ROBERT MUELLER

01:38.842 --> 01:40.044
TESTIFIED TO CONGRESS.

01:40.110 --> 01:41.011
PRESIDENT TRUMP SPOKE WITH

LEADING DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGERS

02:03.934 --> 02:05.803
PRESSURE BY THE PRESIDENT.

02:05.869 --> 02:06.537
PRESSURE.

02:06.603 --> 02:08.338
THAT WAS NOT PRESSURE.

02:08.405 --> 02:10.107
I KNOW WHEN I GIVE PRESSURE.

02:10.174 --> 02:18.174
AND THAT WAS NOT PRESSURE.

04:12.796 --> 04:13.940
YOU CAN PLEASE HELP ME GET DIRT

04:13.964 --> 04:15.933
OUT ABOUT THE SON OF MY

04:15.999 --> 04:20.003
POTENTIAL CHIEF RIVAL JOE BIDEN.

04:20.070 --> 04:23.173
SO TRUMP BASICALLY COMES OUT AND

04:23.240 --> 04:23.774
SAID YEAH, I MADE THAT PHONE

04:23.841 --> 04:23.974
CALL.

04:24.041 --> 04:26.310
SORT OF SETTING UP THE ARGUMENT

04:26.376 --> 04:27.177
THAT DONALD TRUMP AND ALL OF HIS

04:27.244 --> 04:27.978
ALLIES ARE TRYING TO MAKE.

04:28.045 --> 04:30.347
YEAH, THE TRUMP REPUBLICAN

04:30.414 --> 04:31.315
ARGUMENT IS THAT VICE PRESIDENT

04:31.381 --> 04:32.583
BIDEN WAS TRYING TO GET THE

04:32.649 --> 04:33.693
PROSECUTOR IN UKRAINE TO BACK

04:33.717 --> 04:36.653
OFF THE COMPANY ON WHOSE BOARD

04:36.720 --> 04:38.655
HIS SON WAS SITTING.

04:38.722 --> 04:41.091
HIS SON DOING THAT THING WHEN

04:41.158 --> 04:42.860
POWERFUL PEOPLE DO BECAUSE OF

04:42.926 --> 04:43.327
THEIR CONNECTIONS.

04:43.393 --> 04:44.561
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

04:44.628 --> 04:46.530
SAYING THAT BIDEN DID NOTHING

04:46.597 --> 04:49.266
WRONG, THE STORIES HAVE ALL BEEN

04:49.333 --> 04:50.000
DEBUNK

04:50.067 --> 04:50.267
DEBUNKED.

04:50.334 --> 04:50.968
AND THEN YOU HAVE RUDY GIULIANI

04:51.034 --> 04:51.301
ON CNN.

04:51.368 --> 04:56.139
DID YOU ASK THE UKRAINE TO

04:56.206 --> 04:57.206
INVESTIGATE JOE BIDEN?

04:57.241 --> 04:58.251
AND HE WAS LIKE I WOULD NEVER.

04:58.275 --> 05:02.379
SO YOU DID ASK UKRAINE TO

05:02.446 --> 05:03.313
LOOK INTO JOE BIDEN?

05:03.380 --> 05:03.981
OF COURSE I DID.

05:04.047 --> 05:06.383
AND NOW THE QUESTION IS WAS

05:06.450 --> 05:13.090
THERE ACTUALLY THERE IS A

05:13.156 --> 05:16.126
CONVERSATION BETWEEN PRESIDENT

05:16.193 --> 05:17.237
TRUMP AND PRESIDENT ZEMLENSKY.

05:17.261 --> 05:19.429
AND SO WAS THERE IS A

05:19.496 --> 05:19.663
TRIGGER?

05:19.730 --> 05:20.397
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED?

05:20.464 --> 05:22.432
AND THERE IS A TRANSCRIPT OF

05:22.499 --> 05:24.935
THE PHONE CALL, SO WE'LL FIND

05:25.002 --> 05:25.102
OUT.

05:25.168 --> 05:27.170
THE POSSIBILITY OF A

05:27.237 --> 05:29.172
PRESIDENT WHO CONSPIRED WITH A

05:29.239 --> 05:31.108
FOREIGN LEADER TO GET DIRT ON AN

05:31.174 --> 05:33.076
AMERICAN POLITICAL OPPONENT, THE

05:33.143 --> 05:34.745
CALLS FOR IMPEACHMENT ARE GOING

05:34.811 --> 05:35.479
TO BE CLARION.

05:35.545 --> 05:38.382
IN THIS HOUSE OF

05:38.448 --> 05:39.016
REPRESENTATIVES AMONG DEMOCRATS,

05:39.082 --> 05:40.550
THE TECTONIC PLATES BEGIN TO

05:40.617 --> 05:41.551
SHIFT.

05:41.618 --> 05:42.319
ADAM SCHIFF AND NANCY PELOSI

05:42.386 --> 05:45.088
ARE THE DAM THAT HAS BEEN

05:45.155 --> 05:45.689
HOLDING BACK IMPEACHMENT.

05:45.756 --> 05:47.591
THEY HAVE BEEN UNDER

05:47.658 --> 05:49.092
TREMENDOUS PRESSURE TO KEEP

05:49.159 --> 05:50.360
IMPEACHMENT IN THE BAG.

05:50.427 --> 05:54.364
AND AS WE HEAD INTO THIS

05:54.431 --> 05:55.699
WEEK, JOSEPH MAGUIRE DID NOT

05:55.766 --> 05:57.968
TURN THE WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT

05:58.035 --> 06:00.037
OVER TO CONGRESS.

06:00.103 --> 06:02.906
SO PELOSI HAS SAID YOU MUST

06:02.973 --> 06:05.275
PRODUCE THIS COMPLAINT.

06:05.342 --> 06:06.877
OR THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES.

06:06.944 --> 06:08.345
AND EVERYBODY IS READING THAT

06:08.412 --> 06:10.380
AS ‐‐

06:10.447 --> 06:12.215
OR ELSE.

06:12.282 --> 06:18.622
I THINK WHAT WE WILL LEARN IS

06:18.689 --> 06:21.358
WHETHER WHAT SHIVCHIFF SAID IS

06:21.425 --> 06:21.558
RIGHT.

06:21.625 --> 06:28.298
WE MAY HAVE CROSSED TH RUBIC.

06:28.365 --> 06:29.166
AND THAT IS A BIG RIVER.

06:29.232 --> 06:30.167
IT IS A BIG RIVER.

06:30.233 --> 06:31.401
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS TRUE,

06:31.468 --> 06:33.303
BUT I FEEL LIKE WE ARE STANDING

06:33.370 --> 06:35.105
ON THE BANKS OF THE RUBICON

06:35.172 --> 06:36.412
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER WE

06:36.473 --> 06:37.774
WILL CROSS IT OR NOT.

06:37.841 --> 06:39.343
OR WHETHER WE WILL BE UP THE

06:39.409 --> 06:47.409
RUBICON WITHOUT A PADDLE.

06:50.454 --> 06:52.122
PRESIDENT TRUMP TAKES CENTER

06:52.189 --> 06:53.490
STAGE TODAY HERE IN NEW YORK

06:53.557 --> 06:57.461
CITY WHEN HE ADDRESSES THE UNITE

06:57.527 --> 06:58.929
THE NATIONS.

06:58.996 --> 07:02.599
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL DELIVER

07:02.666 --> 07:10.666
HIS VERY IMPORTANT ADDRESS.

07:11.241 --> 07:14.378
AND AT A TIME WHEN HIS

07:14.444 --> 07:22.444
INTERACTIONS ARE UNDER STEXTREM

07:49.346 --> 07:49.546
SCRUTINY.

07:49.613 --> 07:51.415
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT ‐‐

07:51.481 --> 07:53.417
I THINK IT IS RIDICULOUS, IT

07:53.483 --> 07:53.784
IS A WITCH HUNT.

07:53.850 --> 07:54.384
ONLY WAY THAT THEY CAN TRY TO

07:54.451 --> 07:55.018
STOP ME IS THROUGH IMPEACHMENT.

07:55.085 --> 07:55.652
AND WHEN YOU SEE THE READOUT OF

07:55.719 --> 07:56.253
THE CALL, WHICH I ASSUME YOU

07:56.319 --> 07:56.887
WILL SEE AT THIS POINT, YOU WILL

07:56.953 --> 07:57.187
UNDERSTAND.

07:57.254 --> 07:57.821
BUT THERE WAS PRESSURE PUT ON TO

07:57.888 --> 07:58.288
RESPECT TO JOE BIDEN.

07:58.355 --> 07:58.922
WHAT JOE BIDEN DID FOR HIS SON,

07:58.989 --> 07:59.556
THAT IS SOMETHING THEY SHOULD BE

07:59.623 --> 07:59.856
LOOKING AT.

07:59.923 --> 08:01.100
NO MFOR MONTHS THE MODERATE

08:01.124 --> 08:01.725
HAS RESISTED THE I WORD SAYING

08:01.792 --> 08:02.692
IT IS POLITICAL SUICIDE.

08:02.759 --> 08:04.661
WE ARE NOW HEARING FOR THE FIRST

08:04.728 --> 08:06.296
TIME IN THE CENTER OF THE PARTY

08:06.363 --> 08:07.931
SAYING THIS CANNOT STAND, THIS

08:07.998 --> 08:10.233
IS A VIOLATION OF EVERYTHING OUR

08:10.300 --> 08:16.673
REPUBLIC STANDS FOR.

08:16.740 --> 08:18.375
SEVEN FRESHMEN HOUSE

08:18.442 --> 08:22.546
DEMOCRATS COULD NO LONGER HOLD

08:22.612 --> 08:23.046

08:23.113 --> 08:23.447
IMPEACHMENT TRAIN.

08:30.153 --> 08:32.989
THEY REPRESENT, YQUOTE, AN

08:33.056 --> 08:33.890
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE.

08:33.957 --> 08:37.394
THIS AFTERNOON, DEMOCRATS

08:37.461 --> 08:38.828
HUDDLE IN THE HALLS OF CALL AND

08:38.895 --> 08:42.365
DECIDE WHAT THE HELL THEY'RE

08:42.432 --> 08:47.204
GOING TO DO.

08:47.270 --> 08:48.371
DO YOU THINK DEMOCRATS ARE

08:48.438 --> 08:54.111
MOVING TOWARD IMPEACHMENT?

08:54.177 --> 08:58.381
IS THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ON BOARD

08:58.448 --> 08:59.583

SITUATION IN THIS COUNTRY.

09:34.184 --> 09:34.684
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

09:34.751 --> 09:35.552
STATES ASKED A FOREIGN

09:35.619 --> 09:37.020
GOVERNMENT TO INTERFERE IN AN

09:37.087 --> 09:37.287
ELECTION.

09:37.354 --> 09:40.857
IS THAT AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE?

09:40.924 --> 09:45.862
WELL, FIRST LET ME SAY HOW

09:45.929 --> 09:47.464
PLEASED I AM TO BE HERE.

09:47.531 --> 09:48.431
DON'T TELL ANYONE THAT I'M HERE.

09:48.498 --> 09:52.235
I'M IN HIDING RIGHT NOW.

09:52.302 --> 09:55.672
THE PRESIDENT IS MAKING

09:55.739 --> 09:58.375
LAWLESSNESS A VIRTUE.

09:58.441 --> 10:00.443
YOU DON'T ASK FOREIGN

10:00.510 --> 10:02.646
GOVERNMENTS TO HELP US IN AN

10:02.712 --> 10:02.913
ELECTION.

10:02.979 --> 10:06.883
THAT IS SELF‐EVIDENT THAT IT IS

10:06.950 --> 10:07.551
NOT RIGHT.

10:07.617 --> 10:09.486
DO YOU SEE PERIL IN GOING

10:09.553 --> 10:11.488
DOWN THE PATH THAT NOW

10:11.555 --> 10:12.856
TWO‐THIRDS OF YOUR CAUCUS WANTS

10:12.923 --> 10:13.557
TO GO DOWN?

10:13.623 --> 10:15.225
I DON'T SEE POLITICS AS

10:15.292 --> 10:16.359
ANYTHING DO WITH THIS.

10:16.426 --> 10:21.631
THIS IS ABOUT PATRIOTISM.

10:21.698 --> 10:24.000
NEW TERRITORY, NEW DAY IS DAWN,

10:24.067 --> 10:25.569
ANYTHING YOU WANT FOR SAY.

10:25.635 --> 10:29.005

10:31.308 --> 10:31.875
CONDUCT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE

10:31.942 --> 10:37.347
UNITED STATES CAN.

10:37.414 --> 10:39.416
BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE FACTS.

10:39.482 --> 10:41.785
AS SOON AS WE HAVE THE FACTS,

10:41.851 --> 10:42.152
WE'RE READY.

10:42.219 --> 10:46.356
NOW WE HAVE THE FACTS.

10:46.423 --> 10:49.326
WE'RE READY.

10:49.392 --> 10:51.027
HOUSE DEMOCRATS WILL DISCUSS

10:51.094 --> 10:52.963
THE INVESTIGATIONS IN A MEMBERS

10:53.029 --> 10:53.296

10:56.533 --> 11:00.103

11:00.170 --> 11:00.570
QUOTE, TIPPING POINT.

11:00.637 --> 11:02.138
HAVE YOU MOVED ON THE ISSUE

TODAY.

11:10.280 --> 11:10.747
WHY?

11:10.814 --> 11:12.249
BECAUSE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

11:12.315 --> 11:14.618
WE'RE NOW SEEING DEMOCRATS

11:14.684 --> 11:17.887
FILTER OUT THROUGH THIS

11:17.954 --> 11:18.321
HALLWAY ‐‐

11:18.388 --> 11:19.789
AND NANCY PELOSI WILL SPEAK

WITH HOUSE DEMOCRATS.

11:29.299 --> 11:30.367
GOOD AFTERNOON.

11:30.433 --> 11:32.702
THE ACTIONS OF THE TRUMP

11:32.769 --> 11:34.371
PRESIDENCY REVEALED THE

11:34.437 --> 11:35.648
PRESIDENT'S BETRAYAL OF HIS OATH

11:35.672 --> 11:37.140
OF OFFICE, BETRAYAL OF OUR

11:37.207 --> 11:37.874
NATIONAL SECURITY.

11:37.941 --> 11:41.678
AND BETRAYAL OF THE INTEGRITY OF

11:41.745 --> 11:42.779
OUR ELECTIONS.

11:42.846 --> 11:43.747
THEREFORE TODAY I'M ANNOUNCING

11:43.813 --> 11:45.148
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES MOVING

11:45.215 --> 11:46.416
FORWARD WITH AN OFFICIAL

11:46.483 --> 11:49.185
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY.

11:49.252 --> 11:50.353
THE PRESIDENT MUST BE HELD

11:50.420 --> 11:50.687
ACCOUNTABLE.

11:50.754 --> 11:54.357
NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.

11:54.424 --> 12:00.230
IT IS OFFICIAL.

12:00.297 --> 12:07.904
THE IMPEACHMENT DAM JUST BROKE.

12:07.971 --> 12:09.439
THE MOOD IN THE ROOM WAS

12:09.506 --> 12:11.408
DEEPLY SERIOUS.

12:11.474 --> 12:13.643
BECAUSE WE ARE NOW IN THE

12:13.710 --> 12:14.110
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS.

12:14.177 --> 12:15.321
EVERYBODY FELT STRONGLY ABOUT

12:15.345 --> 12:17.414
THAT WITHOUT HAVING EVEN SEEN

12:17.480 --> 12:18.848
THE COMPLAINT OR THE TRANSCRIPT.

12:18.915 --> 12:21.217
YEAH, I THINK PEOPLE WANT TO

12:21.284 --> 12:22.652
FOCUS ON THE TRANSCRIPT, BUT IT

12:22.719 --> 12:23.853
DOESN'T ACTUALLY MATTER.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.288
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID, YES, I

12:25.355 --> 12:26.956
SPOKE TO A FOREIGN ALLY, YES, I

12:27.023 --> 12:29.125

12:29.192 --> 12:34.564
AND THE BIDEN FAMILY AND YES, I

12:34.631 --> 12:34.931
WITHHELD AID.

12:34.998 --> 12:36.966
SO I SAY TO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO

12:37.033 --> 12:39.969
FIND A SMOKING GUN, TRUMP IS THE

12:40.036 --> 12:43.640
SMOKING GUN IN THIS SITUATION.

12:43.707 --> 12:47.143
UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENT, MITCH

12:47.210 --> 12:49.179
McCONNELL ALLOWED REPUBLICAN

12:49.245 --> 12:52.082
CONTROLLED SENATE TO PASS A

12:52.148 --> 12:53.416
RESOLUTION CALLING ON THE TRUMP

12:55.051 --> 12:55.552
WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT TO

12:55.618 --> 12:55.985
CONGRESS.

12:56.052 --> 13:01.624
I UNDERSTAND THE SENATE VOTED

13:01.691 --> 13:07.597
UNANIMOUSLY TO REV RELEASE?

13:07.664 --> 13:08.565
DO YOU THINK MITCH McCONNELL

13:08.631 --> 13:09.099
RECOGNIZES IT?

13:09.165 --> 13:10.233
THEY BETTER.

13:10.300 --> 13:15.004
BUT WHAT ELSE DOES IT TAKE?

13:15.071 --> 13:17.340
THERE IS A ANGER AND FRUSTRATION

13:17.407 --> 13:19.309
AND WHAT IS SHAME FOR OUR

13:19.376 --> 13:19.542
COUNTRY.

13:19.609 --> 13:19.876
THANK YOU.

13:19.943 --> 13:26.383
YOU HAVE A SWING DISTRICT.

13:26.449 --> 13:28.284
PRESIDENT TRUMP WON IT BY SIX

13:28.351 --> 13:28.651
POINTS.

13:28.718 --> 13:31.054
IS THIS POLITICAL SUICIDE?

13:31.121 --> 13:33.390
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

13:33.456 --> 13:35.091
PROTECT THIS COUNTRY AND THESE

13:35.158 --> 13:36.860
SORT OF ALLEGATIONS REPRESENT

13:36.926 --> 13:38.528
SUCH A BETRAYAL OF TRUST.

13:38.595 --> 13:41.798
IT REPRESENTS SUCH A LEVEL OF

13:41.865 --> 13:42.098
CORRUPTION.

13:42.165 --> 13:43.633
WE OWE IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

13:43.700 --> 13:45.568
TO DEFINITIVELY SAY THIS IS NOT

13:45.635 --> 13:46.035
TRUE.

13:46.102 --> 13:47.036
LET'S MOVE ON.

13:47.103 --> 13:49.639
OR THIS IS TRUE, LET'S TAKE THE

13:49.706 --> 13:53.343
NEXT STEPS.

13:53.410 --> 13:55.678
THIS GROWING CONTROVERSY

13:59.549 --> 14:01.618
WHEN WE WOKE UP THIS MORNING,

14:01.684 --> 14:02.762
THE REASONABLE EXPECT TAGTS WAS

14:02.786 --> 14:06.356
THAT THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS WAS

14:06.423 --> 14:08.458
MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION TOWARD

14:08.525 --> 14:11.094
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, BUT THAT WE

14:19.335 --> 14:25.642
I GETS ON TWITTER AND GOES

14:25.708 --> 14:26.843
FUCKING ABOBALLISTIC.

14:26.910 --> 14:28.578
SO MUCH WORK AND SO MUCH SUCCESS

14:28.645 --> 14:29.946
AND DEMOCRATS PURPOSELY HAD TO

14:30.013 --> 14:33.149
RUIN IT WITH MORE BREAKING NEWS,

14:33.216 --> 14:36.052
WITCH HUNT GARBAGE FOLLOWED BY

14:39.422 --> 14:40.422
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS.

14:40.457 --> 14:41.391
YES, I CAN.

14:41.458 --> 14:46.362
AND THEN CLASSIC TRUMP TWEET,

14:46.429 --> 14:47.497

14:50.433 --> 14:51.334
TRUMP TWITTER FEED.

15:04.914 --> 15:06.649

15:06.716 --> 15:06.883

16:27.263 --> 16:33.269
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT, HE IS OUR

16:33.336 --> 16:34.771
SITTING PRESIDENT, AND HE IS

16:34.837 --> 16:37.640
USING HIS FOREIGN POLICY POWERS

16:37.707 --> 16:40.743
TO GO AND LEVERAGE DIRT ON HIS

IS NO QUID PRO QUO.

16:47.517 --> 16:49.485
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT

16:49.552 --> 16:54.357
DEFINITION OF QUID PRO QUO THAT

16:54.424 --> 16:55.424
ISN'T.

16:55.458 --> 16:57.360
MIDWAY THROUGH THE CALL SAYS

16:57.427 --> 16:58.895
THAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO US A

16:58.962 --> 16:59.762
FAVOR ‐‐

16:59.829 --> 17:01.631
I'D LIKE YOU TO DO US A

17:01.698 --> 17:01.831
FAVOR.

17:01.898 --> 17:02.908
CORRUPTION ABUSE OF OFFICE.

17:02.932 --> 17:05.635
THE TRANSCRIPT HAS BEEN

17:05.702 --> 17:06.502
RELEASED AND NOW LOOKING AT THE

17:06.569 --> 17:07.103
REACTION.

17:07.170 --> 17:09.939
WE'LL GO TALK TO THE PRESIDENT'S

17:10.006 --> 17:12.809
STAUNCHEST DEFENDER IN THE HOUSE

17:12.875 --> 17:13.242
OF REPRESENTATIVES.

17:13.309 --> 17:14.810
WHAT WE HEAR IS PROBABLY WHAT WE

17:14.877 --> 17:18.381
WILL LIKELY HEAR FROM MOST

17:18.448 --> 17:18.881
PURCHASES.

17:18.948 --> 17:20.782
NO QUID PRO QUO.

17:20.849 --> 17:21.416
THIS CONVERSATION OCCURRED IN

17:21.483 --> 17:24.354
THE CONTEXT OF TWO LEADERS BEING

17:24.420 --> 17:26.021
MUTUALLY LAUDATORY.

17:26.089 --> 17:27.690
FIRST OF ALL, A QUID PRO QUO

17:27.757 --> 17:30.326
DOESN'T NEED TO BE SPOKEN AND

17:30.393 --> 17:30.627
THE FACT ‐‐

17:30.693 --> 17:32.261
WE'LL IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT

17:32.328 --> 17:35.164
ON AN UNSPOKEN QUID PRO QUO?

17:35.231 --> 17:37.266
WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT

17:37.333 --> 17:38.201
ADMITTING THAT HE ASKED THE

17:38.267 --> 17:42.238
FOREIGN LEADER TO INVESTIGATE A

17:42.305 --> 17:42.672
POLITICAL OPPONENT.

17:42.739 --> 17:43.339
YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT AND

17:43.406 --> 17:44.741
PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE FUSING

17:44.807 --> 17:49.646
THEIR INTERESTS IN ROOTING OUT

17:49.712 --> 17:50.713
CORRUPTION.

17:50.780 --> 17:53.016
DEMOCRATS ARE SHAMELESS WHEN IT

17:53.082 --> 17:54.350
COMES TO PIVOTING GROUND.

17:54.417 --> 17:58.388
IT WAS ALL ABOUT COLLUSION AND

17:58.454 --> 18:01.224
THEN OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

18:01.290 --> 18:06.362
AND NOW IT IS ALL ABOUT THE

18:06.429 --> 18:06.696
UKRAINE.

18:06.763 --> 18:07.930
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

18:07.997 --> 18:10.033
SENATOR, YOU WANT TO CHAT?

18:10.099 --> 18:10.833
HAVE YOU READ THE TRANSCRIPT?

18:10.900 --> 18:11.434
I HAVE.

18:11.501 --> 18:12.869
AND YOUR REACTION?

18:12.935 --> 18:14.504
LOOK, WE SAW A LOT OF FOLKS

18:14.570 --> 18:17.106
IN THE MEDIA, A LOT OF DEMOCRATS

18:17.173 --> 18:18.374
EARLIER THIS WEEK

18:18.441 --> 18:19.685
HYPERVENTILATING AND SAYING THAT

18:19.709 --> 18:23.513
THERE WAS AN ILLEGAL QUID PRO

18:23.579 --> 18:23.680
QUO.

18:23.746 --> 18:24.823
THE TRANSCRIPT CLEARLY DOESN'T

18:24.847 --> 18:26.282
SHOW THAT, SO THE ALLEGATIONS

18:26.349 --> 18:28.584
THAT THE PRESIDENT EVEN JUST A

18:28.651 --> 18:30.386
FEW DAYS AGO HAVE NOT BEEN

18:30.453 --> 18:33.723
DEMONSTRATED ON THE TRANSCRIPT.

18:33.790 --> 18:35.958
SHOULD HE MENTION BIDEN'S

18:36.025 --> 18:36.459
NAME THOUGH?

18:36.526 --> 18:37.193
DOES THAT CROSS THE LINE?

18:48.504 --> 18:49.581

18:49.605 --> 18:51.674
THEIR END GOAL, THEIR END

18:51.741 --> 18:52.751
POSITION, IS IMPEACHMENT AND THE

22:42.438 --> 22:44.840
SERIOUS WRONGDOING AND ON ITS

22:44.907 --> 22:47.209
SURFACE SEEMS VERY CREDIBLE.

22:47.276 --> 22:50.079
WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IS HOW

22:50.146 --> 22:52.782
THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL

22:52.848 --> 22:54.550
INTELLIGENCE THOUGHT IT WAS IN

22:54.617 --> 22:55.918
ANY WAY LAWFUL OR OTHERWISE

22:55.985 --> 22:57.086
SOUND TO KEEP THIS FROM

CONGRESS.

22:57.420 --> 23:00.856
YOU OVER THE WEEKEND SAID

23:00.923 --> 23:04.627
WE'RE ABOUT TO CROSS THE

23:04.694 --> 23:04.860

23:04.927 --> 23:10.366
I THINK IT IS ACCURATE TO SAY

23:10.433 --> 23:13.803
THAT YOU HAVERELUCTANT.

23:13.869 --> 23:15.504
WHAT IS DIFFERENT?

23:15.571 --> 23:17.974
DONALD TRUMP IS USING THE

23:18.040 --> 23:20.876
POWER OF HIS SORRY WITHHOLDING

23:20.943 --> 23:22.278
MILITARY AID TO FIGHT OFF RUSSIA

23:22.345 --> 23:24.080
AND THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD

23:47.370 --> 23:49.672
THE PRESIDENT WAS PRESSURING A

23:49.739 --> 23:52.775
FOREIGN HEAD OF STATE TO

23:52.842 --> 23:56.012
INTERFERE IN A U. S. ELECTION.

23:56.078 --> 23:57.122
YESTERDAY WE WERE PRESENTED

23:57.146 --> 23:58.948
WITH THE MOST GRAPHIC EVIDENCE

23:59.015 --> 24:01.250
YET THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE

24:01.317 --> 24:02.394
UNITED STATES HAS BETRAYED HIS

24:02.418 --> 24:03.853
OATH OF OFFICE.

24:13.696 --> 24:15.998
LETTER OF THE LAW.

24:16.065 --> 24:16.899
AND YET IT WASN'T.

24:16.966 --> 24:18.834
WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR

24:18.901 --> 24:20.269
EXPLANATION.

24:20.336 --> 24:21.704
UPON REVIEWING THE COMPLAINT,

24:21.771 --> 24:22.938
WE WERE IMMEDIATELY STRUCK BY

24:23.005 --> 24:25.141
THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE

24:25.207 --> 24:26.418
ALLEGATIONS IN THE COMPLAINT ARE

24:26.442 --> 24:29.412
SUBJECT TO EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE.

24:29.478 --> 24:31.480
AS A RESULT, WE CONSULTED WITH

24:31.547 --> 24:32.381
THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL OFFICE

24:32.448 --> 24:35.051
AND WERE ADVISED THAT MUCH OF

24:35.117 --> 24:36.585
THE INFORMATION WAS IN FACT

24:36.652 --> 24:39.021
SUBJECT TO EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE.

24:39.088 --> 24:42.158
A PRIVILEGE THAT I DO NOT HAVE

24:42.224 --> 24:43.159
THE AUTHORITY TO WAIVE.

24:43.225 --> 24:44.794
IS THE FIRST PARTY YOU WENT

24:44.860 --> 24:47.997
TO OUTSIDE OF YOUR OFFICE TO

24:48.064 --> 24:50.499
SEEK ADVICE, COUNSEL, DIRECTION

24:50.566 --> 24:51.566
THE WHITE HOUSE?

24:51.600 --> 24:54.203
I HAVE CONSULTED WITH THE

24:54.270 --> 24:55.938
WHITE HOUSE DCOUNSEL AND

24:56.005 --> 24:58.374
EVENTUALLY WE ALSO CONSULTED

25:01.477 --> 25:02.411
OFFICE OF LEGAL DOWN SECOUNSEL.

25:02.478 --> 25:09.819
DID YOU GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE

25:09.885 --> 25:10.019

WENT TO THE OFFICE OF LEGAL

25:11.120 --> 25:19.120
COUNSEL.

25:19.462 --> 25:20.696
SO YOU WENT TO THE WHITE

25:20.763 --> 25:21.230
HOUSE FIRST.

25:21.297 --> 25:24.934
SO YOU WENT TO THE SUBJECT OF

25:25.000 --> 25:26.368
THE COMPLAINT FOR ADVICE FIRST

25:26.435 --> 25:27.712
ABOUT WHETHER YOU SHOULD PROVIDE

25:27.736 --> 25:29.605
THE COMPLAINT TO CONGRESS.

25:29.672 --> 25:31.006
I BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING

25:31.073 --> 25:37.847
HERE IN THIS MATTER IS TOTALLY

25:37.913 --> 25:38.180
UNPRECEDENTED.

25:38.247 --> 25:41.083
THE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT HAS

25:41.150 --> 25:46.122

THE WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT

25:46.822 --> 25:49.425
HAS BEEN RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC.

25:55.297 --> 25:57.299

25:57.366 --> 25:59.068
BUT THERE IS STILL A MAJOR

25:59.135 --> 25:59.668
BOMBSHELL IN IT.

SCHEME BY MOVING COMMUNICATIONS

HOW DO YOU THINK THE FORMER

27:55.317 --> 27:56.118
VICE PRESIDENT IS DEALING WITH

27:56.185 --> 27:56.318
THIS?

27:56.385 --> 27:58.988
WELL, LOOK, ON ONE HAND IT IS

27:59.054 --> 28:01.156
MUCH LARGER THAN ANY ONE

28:01.223 --> 28:01.957
INDIVIDUAL, BUT TO THE EXTENT IT

28:02.024 --> 28:05.027
IS ABOUT JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT

28:05.094 --> 28:06.829
TRUMP SPENDS AN INORDINATE

28:06.895 --> 28:10.065
AMOUNT OF TIMES TRYING TO FIND

28:10.132 --> 28:13.335
WAYS TO TAKE DOWN JOE BIDEN.

28:13.402 --> 28:14.336
UNFORTUNATELY WITH PRESIDENT,

28:14.403 --> 28:15.403
ANYTHING IS GAME.

28:15.437 --> 28:22.177
JOE BIDEN DID NOT WANT TO

28:22.244 --> 28:23.421
HAVE TO TALK TO BABOUT HUNTER B.

28:23.445 --> 28:27.016
AND HE THROWS AS MUCH DIRT ON

28:27.082 --> 28:28.159
THE WALL AS POSSIBLE AND SEE

28:28.183 --> 28:29.385
WHAT IS STICKS.

28:29.451 --> 28:32.688
IN THIS CASE EVERY MAJOR MEDIA

28:32.755 --> 28:33.455
ALLEGATION SAID THESE

28:33.522 --> 28:35.090
ALLEGATIONS ARE BOGUS.

28:35.157 --> 28:36.368
THAT WAS TRUE FOR MANY THINGS

28:36.392 --> 28:37.893
THAT HE SAID IN THE 2016

28:37.960 --> 28:41.096
CAMPAIGN BUT THEY STILL STUCK,

28:41.163 --> 28:42.407
THAT HILLARY CLINTON WAS CROOKED

28:42.431 --> 28:43.632
AND SHE HAD SOMETHING TO HIDE.

28:43.699 --> 28:45.301
HOW DO YOU AVOID THAT KNOWING

28:45.367 --> 28:47.102
THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL

28:47.169 --> 28:49.605
MANIPULATE FACTS AND RESURFACE

28:49.672 --> 28:50.239
DISCREDITED REPORTS?

28:50.306 --> 28:53.375
EVERY TIME ONE OF THESE

28:53.442 --> 28:59.615
SPURIOUS ALLEGATIONS IS WROUGHT

28:59.682 --> 29:01.350
BROUGHT UP, FIRST WORD IS THISES

29:01.417 --> 29:08.190
THAT BEEN DEBUNKED.

29:08.257 --> 29:09.792
THIS COULD SINK HIS

29:09.858 --> 29:10.059
CANDIDACY.

29:10.125 --> 29:11.694
ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT

29:11.760 --> 29:13.028
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW JOE

29:13.095 --> 29:14.363
BIDEN.

29:14.430 --> 29:16.598
THEY LIKE JOE BIDEN.

29:16.665 --> 29:19.735
LOOK, ON ONE LEVEL WE HAVE THIS

29:19.802 --> 29:20.736
SWIRLING AROUND US.

29:20.803 --> 29:22.137
THE IDEA THAT THE PRESIDENT OF

29:22.204 --> 29:22.971
THE UNITED STATES WOULD PUT THE

29:23.038 --> 29:26.175
ENTIRE FOREIGN POLICY APPARATUS

29:26.241 --> 29:27.509
OF THE UNITED STATES AT THE

29:27.576 --> 29:30.346
SERVICE OF HIS RE‐ELECTION AND

29:30.412 --> 29:32.081
NOT THE NATIONAL INTERESTS, HOW

29:32.147 --> 29:34.083
COULD YOU NOT SEE THIS AS A

29:34.149 --> 29:35.084
TRAGEDY AND SOMETHING THAT HAS

29:35.150 --> 29:36.151
TO BE STOPPED.
