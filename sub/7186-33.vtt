00:09.142 --> 00:12.478
<i>¶ Just off the shores</i>

00:12.480 --> 00:14.046

- Let's go!

00:15.616 --> 00:17.016

- Let's go!

00:22.089 --> 00:25.024

00:34.435 --> 00:35.901

00:35.903 --> 00:37.770

<i>- Ahoy!</i>

00:37.772 --> 00:39.271

00:58.391 --> 01:02.394
<i>Yo-ho, let's go!</i>

01:02.396 --> 01:04.696
Ahoy, mateys.

01:04.698 --> 01:08.634
Do you wanna join
my pirate crew?

01:08.636 --> 01:11.470
Great!
To start today's adventure,

01:11.472 --> 01:13.672
everybody say
the pirate password...

01:13.674 --> 01:15.741
Yo-ho-ho!

01:15.743 --> 01:17.609
[all]
Yo-ho-ho!

01:17.611 --> 01:19.278
One more time.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.380
Yo-ho-ho!

01:28.054 --> 01:31.990
Misty, you really
are a wonderful witch
and a good friend, too.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.158
- [laughs]
- Yeah.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.028
That sure was
a great pirate potluck.

01:36.030 --> 01:38.864
- What's next?
- Dessert.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.768
My coconut treasure cake.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.871
I love coconut!

01:45.873 --> 01:49.374
It's rich,
but light and airy.

01:49.376 --> 01:50.709
[Skully]
And fast.

01:50.711 --> 01:53.712
- [Jake] Look out!
- [Skully] Crashing crackers!

01:53.714 --> 01:55.747
[gasps]
Not my Shadow Wand.

01:59.419 --> 02:03.555
Happy toads!
I'm back.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.925
[cackles]

02:06.927 --> 02:11.096
Oh, no.
Misty has turned back
into the wicked Sea Witch.

02:11.098 --> 02:14.600
The one and only.
Ha!

02:14.602 --> 02:17.736
Now where is
the Pirate Princess?

02:17.738 --> 02:20.606
I must find her.

02:20.608 --> 02:24.843
Are you g-gonna try to change
her into g-gold again?

02:24.845 --> 02:26.211
I certainly am.

02:26.213 --> 02:29.715
And this time you pesky
pirates won't stop me.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.416
I'll be ready

02:31.418 --> 02:34.620
with my Shadow Wand.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.188
[cackles]

02:38.992 --> 02:41.760
- [gasps]
- Shiver me shadows.

02:41.762 --> 02:44.930
We've gotta tell
the Pirate Princess that
Misty has turned back

02:44.932 --> 02:47.099
into the Sea Witch.

02:47.101 --> 02:50.035
Mateys, will you help us
stop the Sea Witch

02:50.037 --> 02:52.905
and change her back
to Misty the Wonderful Witch?

02:54.507 --> 02:55.741
Great!

02:55.743 --> 02:57.809
Keep a lookout
for Gold Doubloons.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.978
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,

02:59.980 --> 03:01.647
they'll appear.

03:01.649 --> 03:04.716
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

03:04.718 --> 03:08.153
Yo-ho, let's go warn
the Pirate Princess.

03:11.057 --> 03:13.992
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

03:13.994 --> 03:16.728
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

03:16.730 --> 03:18.163
Let's go!

03:18.165 --> 03:21.433
<i>¶ Heave-ho, here we go</i>
<i>together as a team ¶</i>

03:21.435 --> 03:24.102
<i>¶ Jake and the Never Land</i>
<i>Pirates ¶</i>

03:24.104 --> 03:25.938
<i>¶ And me </i>

03:30.476 --> 03:35.147
Whoo! My, my.
The sea pups are
going somewhere fast.

03:35.149 --> 03:38.684
I'll bet me buttons
they're after treasure.

03:38.686 --> 03:42.154
- And I'll bet me bandana.
- I'll bet me boot.

03:42.156 --> 03:43.522
Both boots.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.892
Enough!
Just follow that ship.

03:48.728 --> 03:52.898
- Ahoy, Pirate Princess.
- Ahoy, pirate friends.

03:52.900 --> 03:56.835
- What brings you here?
- Sea Witch alert!
She's back!

03:56.837 --> 03:58.270
The Sea Witch?!

04:02.942 --> 04:06.044
Surprise, Pirate Princess!

04:06.046 --> 04:10.048
- [cackles]
- Shadowy shores!
What happened to you?

04:10.050 --> 04:12.584
I changed you into
Misty the Wonderful Witch

04:12.586 --> 04:14.453
with my Rainbow Wand.

04:14.455 --> 04:17.089
I'm done with wonderful.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.858
I'm back to being me.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.494
And now
I'm going to turn you

04:22.496 --> 04:25.931
into a statue of gold.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.867
Not if I change you back
into Misty first.

04:28.869 --> 04:32.404
Rainbows away!

04:32.406 --> 04:35.641
Oh, no! My Rainbow Wand's
not strong enough

04:35.643 --> 04:37.309
against your Shadow Wand.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.244
Yay-hey, no way!

04:39.246 --> 04:41.913
We've gotta help
the Pirate Princess.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.415
I've got an idea.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.617
Bucky, the bubble cannon!

04:48.821 --> 04:51.623
Slimy sea slugs.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.860
Ugh! Let me out!
[screams]

04:58.364 --> 04:59.831
Yay-hey!

04:59.833 --> 05:01.633
We stopped the sea witch

05:01.635 --> 05:03.735
and we got four
Gold Doubloons.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.771
Let's grab 'em and go.

05:07.507 --> 05:09.608
It's a good thing you came.

05:09.610 --> 05:12.344
That's for sure.
Now we've gotta find a way

05:12.346 --> 05:15.514
to change the Sea Witch back
into our friend Misty...

05:15.516 --> 05:18.650
Before she returns and tries
to turn you into gold.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.787
Well, my Rainbow Wand
won't do the trick,

05:21.789 --> 05:24.923
but maybe I can find
just the right spell

05:24.925 --> 05:26.692
in my magic book.

05:28.261 --> 05:32.264
Pirate Princess,
why doesn't the Sea Witch
like you?

05:32.266 --> 05:34.232
I'm not sure.

05:34.234 --> 05:37.336
You see, far away beyond
the Never Sea,

05:37.338 --> 05:39.671
we grew up together
in the Coral Kingdom.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.973
You two were mateys?

05:41.975 --> 05:44.810
Oh, no. I don't think
she ever liked me.

05:44.812 --> 05:48.380
When we were little, she was
always playing tricks on me.

05:48.382 --> 05:51.917
She turned my hair green.
She flipped me upside-down,

05:51.919 --> 05:55.954
and then she wanted me
to kiss a frog.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.256
[sighs]
I wish I knew why

05:58.258 --> 06:00.859
she's been so mean to me.

06:00.861 --> 06:04.229
Soon I'll turn
that prissy princess

06:04.231 --> 06:06.164
back into gold,

06:06.166 --> 06:07.566
but first,
I've got to get rid

06:07.568 --> 06:10.702
of those mangy mates
of hers.

06:12.305 --> 06:13.505
Ah!

06:13.507 --> 06:17.175
I think help has just arrived.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.177
Aha! The puny pirates

06:19.179 --> 06:22.214
must be visiting
the Pirate Princess.

06:22.216 --> 06:25.050
With those pests keeping
the Princess busy,

06:25.052 --> 06:26.852
I can finally get me hook

06:26.854 --> 06:29.621
on her diamonds.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.691
Come along, Smee,
tiptoe lively.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.826
Tiptoeing.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.762
[cackles]

06:36.764 --> 06:40.499
[gasps]
The S-s-sea Witch is back.

06:40.501 --> 06:44.669
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
Run, Captain, run!

06:44.671 --> 06:47.139
Please, don't run away.

06:47.141 --> 06:51.843
I'm here to make you
a deal you can't refuse.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.746
One that involves treasure.

06:54.748 --> 06:58.016
Treasure?! Oh, do go on.

06:58.018 --> 07:01.820
You keep those puny pirates
away from the Princess

07:01.822 --> 07:05.157
and I can turn her
into gold,

07:05.159 --> 07:09.060
and you may have
her diamonds.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.996
It's a deal.

07:12.732 --> 07:15.634
- Diamonds!
- [Princess] Aha!

07:15.636 --> 07:18.904
There's my magic book
of spells... up there.

07:18.906 --> 07:21.673
Now we can change the Sea Witch
back to Misty.

07:21.675 --> 07:24.709
- I got it, Princess.
- [Hook] Not for long.

07:24.711 --> 07:27.646
- [grunts]
- Huh?

07:27.648 --> 07:29.448
Blast!

07:31.651 --> 07:35.654
[screams, grunts]
Boiling barnacles.

07:35.656 --> 07:39.224
Get me down
from here, Smee!

07:39.226 --> 07:42.961
Oh, dear, this isn't good.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.364
Pirate Princess,
behind you!

07:46.366 --> 07:48.433
[cackles]

07:48.435 --> 07:51.636
Quick, Skully.
Get my magic book.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.871
Aye-aye.

07:52.873 --> 07:55.907
Say, "Bye-bye, birdie."

07:55.909 --> 07:59.878
Now it's your turn,
Princess.

08:00.947 --> 08:02.414
[Princess] My wand!

08:02.416 --> 08:05.784
Not a chance, Sea Witch.
Try a taste of your own magic.

08:05.786 --> 08:09.087
[cackling]

08:11.190 --> 08:14.125
Save me, Smee!

08:14.127 --> 08:17.496
- Oh!
- [Sea Witch cackles]

08:18.931 --> 08:21.099
The diamonds are all mine.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.635
Come along, Mr. Smee.

08:23.637 --> 08:26.972
I've had enough
of you meddling sea rats.

08:26.974 --> 08:30.275
I'm going to turn you
all into gold!

08:30.277 --> 08:33.044
Izzy, this is an emergency.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.413
Pixie dust away!

08:35.415 --> 08:37.349
[shrieks]

08:38.518 --> 08:41.520
My Shadow Wand!

08:45.191 --> 08:47.926
Yay-hey! We took care
of the Sea Witch

08:47.928 --> 08:50.896
and we got five more
Gold Doubloons.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.797
Let's grab 'em and go.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.299
Is everybody okay?

08:54.301 --> 08:56.234
Looks like we're
all safe, Jake.

08:56.236 --> 08:59.604
You pirates have
ruined everything.

08:59.606 --> 09:01.373
[sniffles]

09:01.375 --> 09:03.441
You broke my Shadow Wand.

09:03.443 --> 09:07.379
I wanted to turn the Pirate
Princess into gold forever

09:07.381 --> 09:11.116
because she wouldn't be
my friend when we were little.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.618
But then why did you
play tricks on her?

09:13.620 --> 09:16.888
I only wanted
to get her attention
and make her laugh.

09:16.890 --> 09:20.625
I thought if she liked my
tricks, she'd like me, too.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.127
Is that true?

09:22.129 --> 09:24.629
If only I had known
that you felt that way.

09:24.631 --> 09:28.500
It's not too late
to be friends
if you want to.

09:28.502 --> 09:30.802
If I want to?

09:30.804 --> 09:34.573
That's what I've
always wanted.

09:34.575 --> 09:38.510
- Oh, my!
- [gasping]

09:38.512 --> 09:41.346
I feel wonderful again!

09:41.348 --> 09:43.648
Because you are wonderful.

09:43.650 --> 09:46.418
You're Misty
the Wonderful Witch.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.653
Awesome!
It looks like the power

09:48.655 --> 09:51.156
of your friendship
changed the Sea Witch back

09:51.158 --> 09:53.491
into Misty the Wonderful
Witch.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.760
<i>¶ Oh, it's wonderful </i>

09:55.762 --> 09:58.229
<i>¶ That you're a friend</i>
<i>to me ¶</i>

09:58.231 --> 10:01.266
<i>¶ Yes, it's wonderful </i>

10:01.268 --> 10:03.068
<i>¶ We're mateys meant to be </i>

10:03.070 --> 10:06.037
<i>¶ Was ever there</i>
<i>a better pair? ¶</i>

10:06.039 --> 10:09.507
¶ Just try
to find one anywhere ¶

10:09.509 --> 10:11.576
¶ It's wonderful

10:11.578 --> 10:15.981
¶ To have a friend
like you! ¶

10:15.983 --> 10:20.385
I hate to break up
the party, but has anyone
seen Old Feather Hat?

10:20.387 --> 10:24.389
Hurry, Smee,
and don't lose any diamonds.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.257
Not so fast, Captain Hook.

10:26.259 --> 10:29.628
By the power of sparrows
and golden crowns,

10:29.630 --> 10:33.264
lift these crooks in the air
and shake them upside-down.

10:33.266 --> 10:36.735
- What in plunder?!
- [screaming]

10:38.704 --> 10:41.272
Rainbows away!

10:41.274 --> 10:43.742
[screaming]

10:47.246 --> 10:49.347
Thank you all,
pirate friends.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.150
Your friendship
saved the day.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.819
And me! [giggles]

10:56.589 --> 10:59.491
Mateys, thanks for helping
stop the Sea Witch

10:59.493 --> 11:02.527
and changing her back
to Misty the Wonderful Witch.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.796
Now let's put all
our Gold Doubloons

11:04.798 --> 11:07.265
into our Team
Treasure Chest.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.307
<i>¶ Way, hey,</i>
<i>well done, crew ¶</i>

11:16.309 --> 11:18.410
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:18.412 --> 11:20.679
<i>¶ Way, hey,</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

11:20.681 --> 11:23.682
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

11:23.684 --> 11:26.217
Come on, count with us.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.753
[all] Yeah!

11:28.755 --> 11:33.124
[Jake]
One, two, three, four.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.493
[Izzy]
Five, six, seven,

11:35.495 --> 11:37.328
eight, nine.

11:37.330 --> 11:40.598
[Jake]
Yo-ho! For solving
Pirate Problems today,

11:40.600 --> 11:44.369
we got nine Gold Doubloons.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.038
And a present from Misty.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.907
We finally got our cake,

11:48.909 --> 11:51.743
and we can eat it, too!

11:51.745 --> 11:54.079
[all laughing]

11:57.883 --> 12:02.020
[Hook]
Diamonds be a pirate
captain's best friend

12:02.022 --> 12:04.689
and now they're all gone.

12:04.691 --> 12:07.525
Cheer up, Captain.
You've got us.

12:07.527 --> 12:10.495
And you're as pretty
as a rainbow.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.964
Rainbows... bah!

12:19.438 --> 12:22.974
Hippolyta! Hippolyta!

12:22.976 --> 12:26.578
[laughing]
I just love that name.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.613
It's no laughing matter.

12:28.615 --> 12:32.083
She was the queen
of the ancient Never Landers.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.753
Legend says she hid
a fabulous treasure

12:34.755 --> 12:36.654
somewhere near here.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.923
But we've been
searching for weeks,

12:38.925 --> 12:41.526
haven't had no luck at all.

12:41.528 --> 12:45.497
Oh, what I wouldn't give
for just a bit of luck.

12:45.499 --> 12:47.799
Luck.
Is that all you need?

12:47.801 --> 12:51.269
Well, I can do something
about that.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.339
See, I have
a lucky gold doubloon.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.807
Blooney's his name.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.675
Me grandpappy gave it to me.

12:57.677 --> 12:59.744
He said, "Bones,

12:59.746 --> 13:02.147
if you're ever in the need
of a bit of luck,

13:02.149 --> 13:05.250
just give old
Blooney a flip."

13:05.252 --> 13:07.185
[scoffs] Nonsense!

13:07.187 --> 13:09.854
A mere coin can't
change your luck.

13:09.856 --> 13:13.124
Old Blooney can. Watch.

13:13.126 --> 13:17.028
Blooney, I want you to make
something lucky happen.

13:22.568 --> 13:25.737
Ahoy, handsome pirate.

13:25.739 --> 13:28.239
[giggles]

13:28.241 --> 13:31.943
Galloping galleons!
That is a lucky coin.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.678
Give me that thing.

13:33.680 --> 13:37.649
I'll see if it's
truly lucky or not.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.657
Ouch! [grunts]

13:45.659 --> 13:47.625
Blasted coin!

13:47.627 --> 13:49.861
I told you it wasn't lucky.

13:49.863 --> 13:52.197
Me grandpappy
wouldn't fib.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.699
I know we could find
that old queen's treasure

13:54.701 --> 13:56.367
with Blooney's help.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.903
If you're so certain,
then take your coin

13:58.905 --> 14:02.340
- and look for it yourself.
- I will.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.476
[Skully] Look alive!
It's Hook and his crew.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.345
Ahoy, Captain Hook.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.648
Oh, no. Can me luck
get any worse?

14:10.650 --> 14:13.251
Well, ahoy, sea pups.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.520
What brings you
to Never Land today?

14:15.522 --> 14:18.690
We're looking for treasure,
but we haven't found a thing.

14:18.692 --> 14:21.392
Well, I'm looking
for treasure, too.

14:21.394 --> 14:25.296
The treasure
of Queen Hippolyta. [laughs]

14:25.298 --> 14:28.466
I be using me lucky coin
Blooney to find it.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.934
Wanna look together?

14:29.936 --> 14:31.536
Sure, Bones.

14:31.538 --> 14:35.640
Mateys, wanna go on a treasure
hunt with Bones' lucky coin?

14:37.443 --> 14:40.812
Great! Keep a lookout
for Gold Doubloons.

14:40.814 --> 14:44.449
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,
they'll appear.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.485
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

14:47.487 --> 14:51.155
Yo-ho, let's go see
what good luck Blooney
can bring us.

14:51.157 --> 14:52.857
Follow me.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.626
So long, Captain.

14:54.628 --> 14:58.763
I'll be back after
we find the treasure.

14:58.765 --> 15:01.900
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

15:01.902 --> 15:04.535
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

15:04.537 --> 15:05.937
Let's go!

15:05.939 --> 15:09.340
<i>¶ Heave-ho, here we go</i>
<i>together as a team ¶</i>

15:09.342 --> 15:11.976
<i>¶ Jake and the Never Land</i>
<i>Pirates ¶</i>

15:11.978 --> 15:14.078
<i>¶ And me </i>

15:15.948 --> 15:19.817
The fools.
Oh, what folly.

15:19.819 --> 15:22.186
Oh, I don't know
about that, Captain.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.721
You know the sea pups.

15:23.723 --> 15:26.424
If there's a treasure,
they're sure to find it.

15:26.426 --> 15:30.061
Oh! It would be like
those puny pests

15:30.063 --> 15:32.430
to stumble
upon the treasure.

15:32.432 --> 15:35.466
Oh, but if they do,

15:35.468 --> 15:38.169
I'll snatch it for me own.

15:39.805 --> 15:43.207
This looks like a good place
to start lucky treasure hunting.

15:43.209 --> 15:46.644
Let's give old Blooney
a flip and see what happens.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.513
Come on, Blooney.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.114
Bring us luck.

15:50.116 --> 15:53.751
Help us find the treasure
of Queen Hippolytuck!

15:53.753 --> 15:55.420
[laughs]

15:57.189 --> 15:58.756
[whistling]

15:58.758 --> 16:01.326
Oh, a soprano bird.

16:05.731 --> 16:08.967
Wow!
That was beautiful.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.835
[whistling]

16:10.837 --> 16:14.772
And look what
Miss Soprano Bird's
built her nest on.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.207
What luck!

16:16.209 --> 16:19.344
Blooney wants us
to follow the trail.
Let's go!

16:23.315 --> 16:26.584
Ahh, so's the coin led 'em
to the bird,

16:26.586 --> 16:29.320
and the bird told 'em
to take the trail.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.290
As if a silly bird
would know anything.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.425
[scoffs] Ha!

16:34.427 --> 16:36.361
- [gasping]
- This is all

16:36.363 --> 16:39.397
that blasted coin's fault.

16:40.899 --> 16:44.502
Uh-oh!
Dead end dead ahead.

16:44.504 --> 16:48.106
Well, mateys, it looks
like we're going to
have to climb over it.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.174
But it doesn't
look very safe.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.410
We'd better think
of something else.

16:52.412 --> 16:56.180
I know.
Let's flip Blooney. Ah!

16:56.182 --> 16:58.182
Whoo-hoo!

16:58.184 --> 16:59.984
Oops. Where'd it go?

16:59.986 --> 17:02.920
You don't know you're own
coin- flippin' strength.

17:02.922 --> 17:04.222
I'll get it.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.124
Huh?

17:06.126 --> 17:08.126
Whoa!

17:08.128 --> 17:09.594
Take cover, mateys.

17:11.330 --> 17:13.798
[Bones groans]

17:13.800 --> 17:16.567
Thanks for the good luck,
Blooney.

17:16.569 --> 17:19.737
[panting]
Must that blasted coin

17:19.739 --> 17:22.373
lead those pests... Oh!

17:22.375 --> 17:23.641
Ouch!

17:23.643 --> 17:26.811
Blasted... coin!

17:26.813 --> 17:30.081
[Cubby]
Hey, this looks like
the end of the trail.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.382
Now what?

17:31.384 --> 17:34.419
I know. It's Blooney time.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.487
[hums fanfare]

17:36.489 --> 17:38.790
Right-o!

17:40.359 --> 17:44.395
What a pretty butterfly.
It's gold, just like Blooney.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.431
[gasps]
I think that means
we should follow it.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.833
- Yeah.
- [laughing]

17:51.103 --> 17:52.837
Bah!

17:52.839 --> 17:55.907
Following coins
and chasing butterflies.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.342
Of all the bilge water.

17:59.445 --> 18:03.314
Ugh! Blasted coin!

18:04.817 --> 18:07.618
[Skully] Crackers!
We lost the bug.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.153
Oh, that's okay.

18:09.155 --> 18:12.857
We'll just flip Blooney
again and see what happens.

18:14.560 --> 18:17.228
Mates, Blooney's
floating away.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.963
I think he wants us
to follow him,

18:18.965 --> 18:21.432
but how do we do that?

18:21.434 --> 18:25.103
We can float on these leaves.
They're big enough to carry us.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.939
Awesome! We found a way
to float down the river,

18:27.941 --> 18:30.141
and we got three
Gold Doubloons.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.977
Let's grab 'em and go
catch up with Blooney

18:32.979 --> 18:36.714
and find the treasure
of Queen Hippolyta.

18:36.716 --> 18:40.451
There go the puny pirates.
After them!

18:40.453 --> 18:43.754
Blooney,
we're right behind you.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.824
Quickly. More leaves.

18:51.597 --> 18:54.632
Blasted coin!
[gurgling]

18:55.701 --> 18:58.769
[cheering, laughing]

19:03.575 --> 19:06.344
That was an awesome ride!

19:06.346 --> 19:10.448
Lovely place,
but no treasure
of Queen Hippolyta.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.283
I think it's time

19:12.285 --> 19:14.852
to flip Blooney again. Ha!

19:17.022 --> 19:18.890
Oops.

19:18.892 --> 19:21.125
[grunting]

19:22.594 --> 19:26.063
Blooney,
I thought I lost you.

19:26.065 --> 19:29.033
Check it out,
behind the waterfall!

19:29.035 --> 19:31.235
Crackers!
It's a tunnel.

19:31.237 --> 19:34.705
Oh, what luck.
Blooney wanted us to find it.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.307
Everybody in!

19:36.309 --> 19:38.943
[panting]

19:38.945 --> 19:42.813
Those puny pests slipped
behind that waterfall.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.849
There must be an opening.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.651
Huh?

19:46.653 --> 19:50.454
Blasted coin!

19:51.523 --> 19:53.257
Shiver me timbers!

19:53.259 --> 19:56.561
This must be the treasure
of Queen Hippolyta.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.296
It's Queen Hippolyta's...

19:58.298 --> 20:00.565
[giggles] hippo.

20:00.567 --> 20:04.769
Whoo! They don't build
'em like that anymore.

20:04.771 --> 20:08.573
Hey, there's a slot.
Just like on a piggy bank.

20:08.575 --> 20:11.375
Well, Blooney,
it's been fun.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.911
Here goes nothing.

20:15.914 --> 20:17.481
- Whoa!
- Awesome!

20:17.483 --> 20:21.219
- Cool!
- [laughs]

20:23.222 --> 20:24.655
For me?

20:24.657 --> 20:27.291
Ohhh, it sounds valuable

20:27.293 --> 20:29.727
and treasure-y, too.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.295
Of course it is.

20:31.297 --> 20:32.863
[all]
Captain Hook!

20:32.865 --> 20:35.233
It's the real treasure
of Queen Hippolyta

20:35.235 --> 20:38.436
and it belongs to me.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.172
- Yay-hey, no way!
- Captain Hook,

20:41.174 --> 20:42.974
that's not the way out.

20:42.976 --> 20:45.009
[laughs]

20:45.011 --> 20:48.346
Finally, the treasure
of Queen Hippolyta

20:48.348 --> 20:50.448
is mine, all mine!

20:50.450 --> 20:53.251
Huh? [screams]

20:53.253 --> 20:56.821
Whoa!
This is an emergency.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.624
Pixie dust away!

21:01.326 --> 21:04.362
Coconuts!
I can't look.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.901
Way-hey, way to go!

21:10.903 --> 21:15.239
We rescued Captain Hook
and got five more
Gold Doubloons.

21:15.241 --> 21:17.608
Let's grab 'em and go.

21:17.610 --> 21:21.612
[shudders]
I thought I'd keep
falling forever.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.848
Don't you worry, Captain.

21:23.850 --> 21:27.985
We'll get you back on board
the <i>Jolly Roger,</i>
<i>safe and sound.</i>

21:27.987 --> 21:32.089
Bones, you don't want
to forget your lucky treasure.

21:34.293 --> 21:38.129
Mateys, thanks for helping
us find the treasure
of Queen Hippolyta.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.830
Now let's put all
our Gold Doubloons

21:39.832 --> 21:42.700
into our Team
Treasure Chest.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.942
¶ Way-hey, well done,
crew ¶

21:51.944 --> 21:54.145
¶ Everyone knew
just what to do ¶

21:54.147 --> 21:56.180
¶ Way-hey,
with help from you ¶

21:56.182 --> 21:59.116
¶ Time to count
our gold doubloons ¶

21:59.118 --> 22:01.485
Come on, count with us.

22:01.487 --> 22:04.088
[all] Yeah!

22:05.057 --> 22:07.558
[Cubby]
One, two, three

22:07.560 --> 22:10.061
[Izzy]
Four, five, six,

22:10.063 --> 22:11.996
seven, eight.

22:11.998 --> 22:15.499
[Jake]
Yo-ho! For solving
Pirate Problems today,

22:15.501 --> 22:18.836
we got eight Gold Doubloons.

22:18.838 --> 22:22.873
Say, mateys, do you think any
of our doubloons are lucky?

22:22.875 --> 22:24.442
I think they're all lucky.

22:24.444 --> 22:27.778
After all, we got
to find 'em together.

22:29.748 --> 22:31.349
[Hook sighs]

22:31.351 --> 22:33.584
Chin up, sir.

22:33.586 --> 22:36.520
There'll be
other treasures someday.

22:36.522 --> 22:40.991
Captain, you never did get
to see the treasure
of Queen Hippolyta.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.360
Lookee!

22:45.230 --> 22:47.398
No! No!

22:47.400 --> 22:50.301
Lucky coins.
Just like Blooney.

22:50.303 --> 22:53.637
Hundreds of 'em.
Let's flip 'em
and see what happens.

22:53.639 --> 22:57.675
Keep them away!
They're nothing
but bad luck.

22:57.677 --> 23:00.678
[screams]

23:00.680 --> 23:04.682
But lucky for the captain,
the water broke his fall.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.817
[laughs]

23:06.819 --> 23:08.319
<i>¶ Grab 'em and go </i>

23:08.321 --> 23:09.920
<i>¶ Yo-ho, yo-ho! </i>

23:09.922 --> 23:12.957
<i>¶ We found</i>
<i>Gold Doubloons ¶</i>

23:12.959 --> 23:15.693
<i>¶ Grab 'em and go,</i>
<i>yo-ho, let's go ¶</i>

23:15.695 --> 23:19.263
<i>¶ We got</i>
<i>so much more to do ¶</i>

23:19.265 --> 23:21.866
- <i>¶ I love the way they jingle</i>
<i>in me pockets like this ¶ </i>
<i>- [coins clanking]</i>

23:21.868 --> 23:24.602
<i>¶ I stack 'em up</i>
<i>and count 'em out</i>
<i>and do it all again ¶</i>

23:24.604 --> 23:27.338
<i>¶ The pirate problems</i>
<i>are solved with me crew ¶</i>

23:27.340 --> 23:30.875
<i>¶ There's just</i>
<i>one thing to do ¶</i>

23:30.877 --> 23:33.577
<i>¶ Grab 'em and go,</i>
<i>yo-ho, yo-ho! ¶</i>

23:33.579 --> 23:36.380
<i>¶ We found</i>
<i>Gold Doubloons ¶</i>

23:36.382 --> 23:39.717
<i>¶ Grab 'em and go,</i>
<i>yo-ho, let's go ¶</i>

23:39.719 --> 23:42.753
<i>¶ We got so much</i>
<i>more to do ¶</i>

23:42.755 --> 23:47.057
