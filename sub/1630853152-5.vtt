WEBVTT

00:14.598 --> 00:16.099
Fuck. Hang on.

00:17.643 --> 00:18.727
Fuck it's--

00:19.311 --> 00:20.604
Shit. Give me your hand.

00:22.648 --> 00:25.984
-It's higher than it looks. Be careful.
-It's not that high.

00:26.068 --> 00:27.069
Just be careful.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.946
All right, Min. It's fine.
It's not that hard.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.573
It's just higher than it looks.
Ready?

00:33.408 --> 00:35.160
Hands off, Min.

00:36.703 --> 00:37.788
Shit.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.959
For fuck's sake.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.002
What are you moaning about now?

00:44.086 --> 00:45.462
Fucking ripped my coat.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.048
I've ripped my coat completely.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.969
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine. Why? You see anyone?

00:52.052 --> 00:53.720
-No, can you?
-No.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.526
Taverner's voice mail.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.736
In the car you said you'd tell me.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.864
So, what did she mean
about Charles's death?

01:12.447 --> 01:15.534
Read the room, will you?
Is now really the time?

01:26.170 --> 01:27.254
It's Lamb.

01:29.381 --> 01:30.716
"Minuisa."

01:33.260 --> 01:34.261
You've got a key?

01:35.470 --> 01:36.471
Where the fuck is Struan?

01:36.555 --> 01:38.473
I told you to get Struan.

01:38.557 --> 01:40.392
The Dogs got to him just before us.

01:40.475 --> 01:41.810
-Did they see you?
-Yo.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.314
Cartwright?

01:45.397 --> 01:47.316
Went to try and wake Sleeping Beauty.

01:48.567 --> 01:51.653
Sid. She's in a coma and is a beauty.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.031
Or was, till she got shot in the head.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.115
Oh, Jesus, Ho.

01:55.199 --> 01:57.034
Dog rolled up, so I split.

01:57.910 --> 01:58.911
We gotta go.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.497
Taverner will pick us off one by one.

02:02.581 --> 02:03.999
Find someone to turn.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.918
She and Black had a plan.

02:06.001 --> 02:10.047
Now that's gone to shit, she'll try
and play it as Slough House gone rogue.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.966
And what about the boy?
What happens to Hassan?

02:13.926 --> 02:16.303
If he's not dead already,
he soon will be.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.893
You're a fucking dickhead, Roddy.

02:25.187 --> 02:26.647
I remember where I saw Alan Black.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.733
He was meeting with Taverner.

02:31.902 --> 02:34.821
All right, go back.
What were they doing?

02:35.489 --> 02:38.367
Talking at her gym café.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.577
It came back to me when I saw Sid

02:40.661 --> 02:43.288
because she took the piss out of me
for following Taverner.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.041
They were meeting secretly.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.377
But it's your word against hers.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.629
Yes, but I was following her
for surveillance training.

02:52.214 --> 02:53.715
So I took a photograph.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.594
Well, do you have it?

02:58.136 --> 02:59.471
No, not yet.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.640
But I think I know
where there might be a copy.

03:01.723 --> 03:02.850
A copy?

03:02.933 --> 03:03.892
This is hopeless.

03:04.393 --> 03:06.728
Well, it would certainly seem that way.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.609
Look.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.696
I don't normally do these
kind of speeches,

03:15.779 --> 03:17.406
but this feels like a big moment,

03:17.489 --> 03:21.159
and if it all turns to shit,
I might not see any of you again.

03:25.664 --> 03:28.250
You're fucking useless. The lot of you.

03:28.917 --> 03:32.421
Working with you has been the lowest
point in a disappointing career.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.465
Right.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.176
Cartwright, you're with me.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.055
But wait, what do we do?

03:42.139 --> 03:44.433
Well, try not to get caught
for as long as you can.

03:44.516 --> 03:45.976
My money's on about 30 minutes.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.853
Well, we can try and save Hassan.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.023
That'd be a sure way
to get him killed.

03:51.106 --> 03:54.693
Go lock yourselves in a toilet somewhere.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.447
What a wanker.

03:58.530 --> 04:01.867
-Where are we going?
-To go and get that photo, you dickhead.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.869
Back there, that's you
goading them into action, right?

04:03.952 --> 04:06.205
Fuck no. I meant every word.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.332
Right. Just checking.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.713
Fucking Christ.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.890
Police are still frantically searching

05:06.974 --> 05:09.268
for the whereabouts
of the hostage Hassan Ahmed,

05:09.351 --> 05:11.895
whose kidnappers have threatened
to behead him

05:11.979 --> 05:14.398
at sunrise this morning around 6:30--

05:14.481 --> 05:15.440
You hear that?

05:15.524 --> 05:18.902
So they're still expecting us
to do that thing that we're not--

05:18.986 --> 05:20.070
we're not fucking doing.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.822
Nothing about the dead spook.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.074
Maybe they haven't found the body yet.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.159
They'll have found the body.
With you two screaming

05:26.243 --> 05:28.954
like a pair of little girls,
someone will have called it in.

05:30.414 --> 05:32.291
You know why it's not on the news, right?

05:33.292 --> 05:35.878
They wanna bury it. And us.

05:35.961 --> 05:39.840
An MI5 agent involved in a kidnap plot.
They don't want people talking about that.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.302
Nah. We are gonna die
resisting arrest, boys.

05:43.385 --> 05:46.805
So the way I see it is we may as well
have some fun first.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.391
Chop-chop.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.226
Fucking hell.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.355
-So what?
-Just said that.

05:55.939 --> 05:56.940
So what?

05:59.234 --> 06:00.861
See any lights?

06:00.944 --> 06:04.281
-Second floor, maybe.
-Did you leave them on?

06:05.199 --> 06:06.200
I don't remember.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.826
-Well, think.
-I don't know.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.037
You were there too. Why didn't you check?

06:10.120 --> 06:12.331
Because I've earned the right not to.

06:27.638 --> 06:29.306
Well, it looks clear.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.976
Doesn't mean to say the place
isn't swarming with Dogs.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.021
Or a clean-up team for the body or a trap?

06:37.314 --> 06:38.857
Well, you better go in and find out.

06:42.361 --> 06:43.737
I'm going in alone, am I?

06:44.363 --> 06:46.573
Every man for me, Cartwright.

06:46.657 --> 06:47.783
Don't worry.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.577
I'll be here,
guarding the breach and all.

06:51.828 --> 06:52.913
Thanks.

06:58.669 --> 07:01.004
What is the latest
we know about Hassan Ahmed?

07:01.088 --> 07:03.799
Well, time really is of the essence now.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.677
But we've had no further updates
from either the Metropolitan Police

07:06.760 --> 07:08.720
-or the security services…
-That poor boy.

07:08.804 --> 07:10.514
-…with regards to the release…
-How can you eat?

07:10.597 --> 07:11.598
…of Hassan Ahmed.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.476
Relax. Dogs are nowhere near.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.936
You hacked the Dogs' comms?

07:16.019 --> 07:18.230
Snuck into their kennel,
muzzled them bitches,

07:18.313 --> 07:20.357
-stole their bones.
-That's so wrong.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.861
Whatever. They're outside our homes
and waiting for us.

07:25.779 --> 07:29.241
Waiting for us to use our phones
and credit cards or passports.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.368
So, we just hole up in here
for the rest of our lives, do we?

07:31.451 --> 07:32.536
Right. We're fucked then.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.787
Can't track me.

07:33.871 --> 07:35.664
I'm a digital ghost, so I'm fine.

07:35.747 --> 07:37.165
Thanks for the team spirit, Ho.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.543
You're forgetting Lamb.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.128
Lamb doesn't care about us.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.922
As soon as whatever he's got planned
goes south, he's gonna forget us.

07:44.006 --> 07:44.923
That's not true.

07:45.007 --> 07:47.718
The thing Charles always said
about Lamb--

07:48.635 --> 07:49.678
Charles?

07:51.972 --> 07:54.558
You hurt his joes,
he'll never stop coming for you.

07:54.641 --> 07:58.270
And the thing, for Lamb, there's nothing
worse than not being able to get even.

07:58.353 --> 07:59.938
And he's not gonna wanna lose to Taverner.

08:00.022 --> 08:01.773
-Exactly.
-I think he's got even more contempt

08:01.857 --> 08:03.192
for her than he does for us.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.152
Wow, that's a skip-load of contempt.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.403
And meanwhile, we what?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.655
Can we talk about
the ethics of this for a moment?

08:08.739 --> 08:13.035
Because if they are going to behead
Hassan at 6:30 a.m.,

08:13.118 --> 08:16.121
as they say they are,
are people really going to watch?

08:16.205 --> 08:18.081
And if they do, are they not complicit?

08:18.165 --> 08:20.209
Roddy, where are the Park on Hassan?

08:21.126 --> 08:23.921
They've just narrowed it down
to ten vehicles that have left the area.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.549
The one thing that we can bring to this
is that we knew Alan Black,

08:27.633 --> 08:28.634
so,

08:29.510 --> 08:31.345
what do we remember about him?

08:31.428 --> 08:32.971
He was sent to Slough House

08:33.054 --> 08:35.682
for sleeping with the Venezuelan
ambassador's wife while undercover.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.518
Apart from that.

08:37.601 --> 08:39.727
He moaned a lot. Never bought biscuits.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.730
-Oh, my God.
-Sorry, what? We're free-forming.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.732
-There's no bad ideas here.
-He was really lazy.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.609
And that's better than what I said, is it?

08:45.692 --> 08:47.653
Listen, he was undercover
with the Sons of Albion,

08:47.736 --> 08:49.363
so there would have been
a birth certificate,

08:49.446 --> 08:52.324
passport, credit cards, the full legend.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.284
Yeah. Deep cover's expensive.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.746
He was tight, so he definitely
wouldn't want to have to front that.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.457
More than that. Taverner won't want
any of it to show up on the books.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.960
So he could have used an old ID.

09:03.710 --> 09:04.711
Roddy?

09:06.171 --> 09:07.923
If you'll give me a few minutes, ladies.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.049
And gentleman.

09:10.801 --> 09:11.885
Ladies.

09:53.844 --> 09:56.013
And that's another "Ho-me" run.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.891
Meet Dermot Radcliffe.

09:58.974 --> 10:01.143
AKA Alan Black.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.519
Legend for a football hooligan.

10:02.603 --> 10:03.896
Ex-forces too.

10:03.979 --> 10:05.898
That's catnip for British nationalists.

10:05.981 --> 10:08.150
Let's see what Dermot's
been up to recently.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.253
Sorry, Jed. Lamb's idea.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.681
-Lamb and Standish--
-Have not been apprehended.

10:39.765 --> 10:41.767
-Yes, I can see that.
-Lamb pulled a gun.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.310
You didn't frisk him?

10:43.393 --> 10:44.520
It was in Standish's bag.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.023
This is them?

10:48.106 --> 10:50.275
Fingerprints match those
at the Roupell Street house.

10:50.359 --> 10:52.945
They all have priors. ABH, GBH, burglary.

10:53.028 --> 10:55.489
-How we doing on the vehicles?
-Still have eight to locate,

10:55.572 --> 10:57.699
but they might be avoiding roads
with CCTV.

10:57.783 --> 10:59.034
They may have swapped vehicles.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.203
We're following up
on all reported vehicle thefts.

11:01.286 --> 11:02.496
-Ma'am.
-Not now.

11:05.749 --> 11:06.834
Showtime.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.169
We're running out of petrol.

11:09.670 --> 11:10.671
No.

11:11.672 --> 11:13.090
Fuck off!

11:13.173 --> 11:15.050
So what? Stop at the garage.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.553
-We're covered in fucking blood.
-Bit of a giveaway.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.012
We'll end up on the CCTV.

11:19.096 --> 11:20.681
Shouldn't have left
the balaclavas behind.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.182
Well, we can't make the boat

11:22.266 --> 11:24.184
-without petrol, can we?
-Just calm down. I've got a plan.

11:24.268 --> 11:27.229
-Yeah?
-We drive until we run out,

11:27.312 --> 11:28.689
and then we're gonna chop his head off.

11:29.273 --> 11:31.233
What the fuck is wrong with you?

11:31.316 --> 11:33.151
-Yeah, let's just think about this.
-We don't have options.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.779
Yeah, we do.
We have the option not to fucking do that.

11:35.863 --> 11:37.531
And have all this for nothing?

11:37.614 --> 11:40.033
While they set us up and make us
look like twats and we don't even do

11:40.117 --> 11:42.369
the thing that we said we were gonna do.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.663
No, I can't have that.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.999
We'll be a fucking joke.

11:47.082 --> 11:48.917
People need to fear and respect us.

11:49.001 --> 11:52.129
They need to know that we mean
what we say when we say it.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.883
Enough is enough, man.
This is our country, and we want it--

11:55.966 --> 11:57.176
Fucking shut up!

11:59.553 --> 12:01.388
I've had enough. Okay?

12:02.055 --> 12:05.017
-Where'd you get that?
-On the guy whose head he cut off, eh?

12:05.100 --> 12:07.769
He said he was a spy,
but you didn't check his pockets, did ya?

12:07.853 --> 12:09.229
And I'm the dumb one, aren't I?

12:09.313 --> 12:12.232
You'd rather spill my British blood
than his, then you're a traitor.

12:12.316 --> 12:13.525
Yeah.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.737
Get in the back. Check he's okay.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.238
You're a fucking embarrassment, man.

12:18.322 --> 12:20.032
I think he's being sick.

12:20.115 --> 12:22.159
Yep. He's choking on his sick.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.036
-Result.
-Hey.

12:24.119 --> 12:26.455
Pull over. Chop-chop.

12:38.050 --> 12:39.051
Get out.

12:40.177 --> 12:41.178
Go on.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.347
I said get out, now.

12:44.056 --> 12:45.682
Come on. Move it.

12:48.685 --> 12:51.188
Just move it. Open the door.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.316
Right. Lift him up.

12:55.067 --> 12:58.153
And get that fucking tape off his face.

12:59.321 --> 13:00.906
Fuck.

13:00.989 --> 13:01.990
Okay.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.286
Put something in his mouth.

13:06.370 --> 13:07.371
In case he screams.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.456
Why aren't you threatening him,
you fucking pussy?

13:09.540 --> 13:11.333
You told him
you're not gonna kill him, didn't ya?

13:11.416 --> 13:14.294
Don't fucking push me. Okay?

13:14.378 --> 13:15.504
Don't!

13:16.839 --> 13:19.216
No fuel. Nowhere to go.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.051
What's the plan now, Captain?

13:24.513 --> 13:25.681
We get some petrol, right?

13:27.224 --> 13:28.517
We get to the boat…

13:29.852 --> 13:32.145
-and we let the kid go.
-Who's gonna get the petrol?

13:34.481 --> 13:35.482
What?

13:35.566 --> 13:37.150
Have you looked in the mirror?

13:38.026 --> 13:39.570
Who's gonna get out of the van?

13:42.364 --> 13:44.449
Fuck it. Fuck it.

13:48.579 --> 13:50.038
He is.

13:52.791 --> 13:56.170
Got him. Like a rat in a trap
that I will kill with a hammer.

13:57.546 --> 14:00.132
"Triple-D Car Hire." Leeds address.

14:00.215 --> 14:01.466
Registration number?

14:03.010 --> 14:04.094
That will take a while.

14:07.264 --> 14:08.348
Get me a coffee.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.896
I need fuel for this one.

14:13.979 --> 14:16.565
An SQL injection attack will take hours,

14:16.648 --> 14:19.276
which leaves a malware bomb
as the most effective method,

14:19.359 --> 14:22.070
but that needs someone
to open an email, so…

14:24.239 --> 14:26.825
Cheers, Standish. Double espresso.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.421
I thought you could hack anything.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.131
I can.

14:41.632 --> 14:44.343
I'm not saying I can't do it.
Just that it will take some time.

14:44.426 --> 14:45.844
How much time do you need, Ho?

14:45.928 --> 14:48.805
Because the kid's gonna get beheaded
in about two and a half hours.

14:50.432 --> 14:52.684
I'll tell you what I can do real quick.

14:52.768 --> 14:56.104
Check your search history
and tell everyone what porn you look at.

14:56.188 --> 14:57.689
Fine, 'cause I've got nothing to hide.

15:02.361 --> 15:03.612
-Don't you fucking dare.
-Hey.

15:03.695 --> 15:06.281
-Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
-What's wrong with you?

15:06.365 --> 15:07.658
You're eight years old.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.202
-Pardon?
-Where's my coffee?

15:10.285 --> 15:13.413
I didn't get you a coffee.
I got you the registration number.

15:13.497 --> 15:15.165
DE15 CGK.

15:15.249 --> 15:17.042
-What? How?
-Well, I rang them up.

15:17.125 --> 15:20.128
And said what? "Do you mind breaking
multiple data protection laws?"

15:20.212 --> 15:23.298
No, I said th-that I'd had an accident
with one of their vehicles

15:23.382 --> 15:26.677
and I had the driver's name,
but because I was so shaken,

15:26.760 --> 15:29.638
I couldn't read
the registration number I'd written down.

15:30.889 --> 15:34.017
I think the words you're looking for, Ho,
and these would be a first for you,

15:34.101 --> 15:36.103
are, "Well done" and "Thank you."

15:37.312 --> 15:39.690
It's on the list of vehicles
the Park are looking for.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.984
Then we need to get them
to focus on that vehicle.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.944
How do we let the Park know
that without them tracking us?

15:44.027 --> 15:46.280
Oh, my God. Min, a kid's life is at stake.

15:46.363 --> 15:49.241
I know,
but Lamb told us not to get caught.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.994
Can't we track it ourselves?

16:09.761 --> 16:11.305
-Stop!
-Stop!

16:11.388 --> 16:12.681
Stop!

16:13.765 --> 16:14.766
Stop!

16:14.850 --> 16:16.059
Stay in the vehicle.

16:19.104 --> 16:20.564
Yes, I know I'm gonna be

16:20.647 --> 16:23.275
I'm gonna be the man
Who's working hard for you

16:24.693 --> 16:26.403
And when the money

16:26.486 --> 16:27.321
Stay there.

16:27.404 --> 16:31.116
Comes in for the work I do
I'll pass almost every penny on to you

16:32.326 --> 16:34.912
-Move! Move!
-Come on, let's go!

16:34.995 --> 16:36.288
Move!

16:37.331 --> 16:39.458
Go. Go. Move.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.336
Well, I know I'm gonna be

16:42.419 --> 16:45.756
I'm gonna be the man
Who's growing old with you

16:46.673 --> 16:50.260
But I would walk 500 miles

16:50.344 --> 16:54.389
And I would walk 500 more

16:57.392 --> 16:59.561
Can you get out of the vehicle, please,
Mr. Lamb?

17:00.270 --> 17:02.314
No, no. I'm quite comfortable
where I am.

17:02.397 --> 17:05.858
These seats are lovely.
And they're heated too.

17:05.943 --> 17:09.279
-Step out of the vehicle now.
-Nah, I'm okay where I am.

17:09.363 --> 17:12.950
You go fetch your boss and tell him
I've brought the car back,

17:13.032 --> 17:15.536
but we need to go over the damage waiver.

17:22.125 --> 17:25.628
You help us get petrol,
you help us get to the boat,

17:25.712 --> 17:27.214
and we will let you go. I swear.

17:28.924 --> 17:31.093
Yeah? Okay.

17:31.176 --> 17:33.804
Listen, be cool. Okay?

17:34.596 --> 17:36.807
He's seen all our faces, man.
He has got to go.

17:36.890 --> 17:40.185
No! Listen.
Why aren't you taking me seriously?

17:40.269 --> 17:42.020
'Cause I'm the one with the fucking gun,
remember?

17:42.104 --> 17:44.731
He's got a point. Look,
I don't like it either, but he's right.

17:44.815 --> 17:47.442
Please, please.
I'll say I never saw your faces

17:47.526 --> 17:50.445
or I never heard your voices
or I blanked it out from stress.

17:50.529 --> 17:52.865
Right now he'll say anything.

17:53.615 --> 17:55.242
My uncle's got money.

17:55.325 --> 17:56.451
Proving my point.

17:56.535 --> 17:58.287
No, straight up. My uncle's rich.

17:58.370 --> 18:01.874
Look, your exit plan, it-- it might not
work, but my uncle, he can sort that.

18:01.957 --> 18:05.544
-He can help you. He can make something--
-You little fucking lying rat!

18:05.627 --> 18:08.005
Hey! Hey! Fucking stop it!

18:11.383 --> 18:12.968
Your uncle.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.012
Where is he?

18:16.013 --> 18:17.014
Islamabad.

18:18.015 --> 18:19.183
Where?

18:19.266 --> 18:20.642
Pakistan.

18:20.726 --> 18:22.269
What the fuck use is that to us?

18:22.352 --> 18:24.813
-You get your money and you disappear.
-This is such fucking bullshit.

18:24.897 --> 18:27.649
-He's messing with ya.
-Fucking stop it. I'm thinking, okay?

18:27.733 --> 18:29.943
-That should take a while.
-Hey.

18:30.694 --> 18:33.488
Fucking don't. Okay? Don't.

18:40.329 --> 18:42.206
It's gotta be worth a shot, yeah.

18:43.498 --> 18:44.458
Yeah?

18:46.752 --> 18:50.631
But you're coming on the boat too, and you
stay with us till we get the money.

19:04.311 --> 19:08.482
La la la, la la la
La la la, la la la

19:11.818 --> 19:13.362
La la la, la la la

19:13.445 --> 19:14.988
Get out of the car.

19:15.072 --> 19:16.156
What?

19:16.240 --> 19:17.741
Get out of the car.

19:19.910 --> 19:21.662
Is this a joke?

19:21.745 --> 19:23.539
No, it's the Proclaimers.

19:23.622 --> 19:24.915
Get out of the--

19:28.961 --> 19:31.672
Nick, relax. I brought the car back.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.298
You pulled a gun on me.

19:33.924 --> 19:36.218
No, I delegated that. And any court of law

19:36.301 --> 19:37.845
will tell you there's a difference.

19:37.928 --> 19:41.557
And she didn't pull a gun on you.
She pulled a gun on your boy.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.684
Get out of the car.

19:45.602 --> 19:46.645
Are you gonna shoot me?

19:46.728 --> 19:49.773
-Not right now.
-Yeah, well, what about one of your lads?

19:49.857 --> 19:54.862
Hair triggers make natural
scratching posts for itchy indexes.

19:55.487 --> 19:57.072
They're not gonna do anything
unless you do.

19:57.155 --> 19:59.533
You got my word on that.
Now get out of the fucking car.

19:59.616 --> 20:00.784
All right. Good.

20:01.994 --> 20:04.538
'Cause I was wanting a little word
with Lady Di.

20:09.251 --> 20:10.252
All right.

20:11.295 --> 20:15.257
Just reaching for a peashooter.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.341
Here you go.

20:20.179 --> 20:21.346
Park it downstairs.

20:21.889 --> 20:23.265
I could murder a coffee.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.809
What's the canteen like in this gaff?

20:25.893 --> 20:27.269
Dogs en route. Stand by.

20:45.996 --> 20:47.581
What's your plan then, big man?

20:49.041 --> 20:53.045
Hey, you get out. You fill up the van.

20:53.128 --> 20:54.671
Nod, nod, nod.

20:54.755 --> 20:58.884
You fill up the van,
and we all get the fuck out of here.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.093
Yes?

21:04.973 --> 21:06.308
Give him some money.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.354
How do you know he won't do a runner?

21:11.813 --> 21:14.566
Hey, listen, kid. You've gotta come back.

21:14.650 --> 21:16.485
See that lady in the front filling up?

21:16.568 --> 21:18.320
The one with the two kids in the car?

21:19.404 --> 21:20.405
Hey!

21:21.240 --> 21:22.658
Do you see that woman?

21:26.912 --> 21:28.121
If you do anything wrong,

21:28.789 --> 21:31.542
I'll walk round to the back of the van,
and I'll get my axe out.

21:31.625 --> 21:34.211
And I'll cut her kids' heads off
in front of her.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.797
Then I'll cut her head off, then yours.

21:37.381 --> 21:38.715
And you know I'll do that, right?

21:39.842 --> 21:41.093
Yeah.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.606
Hey, kid. Don't fuck this up.

22:15.377 --> 22:16.545
Diesel, yeah?

22:18.630 --> 22:21.341
Knobhead. Keep your eye on him.

22:27.431 --> 22:30.267
Excuse me. Hello.

22:30.893 --> 22:33.353
-For fuck's sake.
-No, no, no.

22:33.437 --> 22:36.190
-Fuck off.
-I'm sorry, I need your help.

22:36.273 --> 22:39.109
Can't get me petrol cap back on.

22:41.195 --> 22:43.155
Maybe the attendant can help.

22:44.740 --> 22:47.242
Oh, no. 'Cause he's stuck behind glass
and, you know…

22:47.326 --> 22:49.286
-What's she saying?
-…the only way I can get…

22:49.369 --> 22:50.537
Fuck this.

22:50.621 --> 22:52.539
…I gotta get moving again soon.

22:55.751 --> 22:56.585
But I'll--

23:00.005 --> 23:03.300
But I'll, No, I'll work it out.

23:04.009 --> 23:06.929
Hey, Mervin. Help the poor woman.

23:08.805 --> 23:10.307
Hey, look, I'm sorry about him.

23:11.433 --> 23:14.645
Think he'd be a lot happier.
He's getting married in seven days.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.441
It's a stag weekend.

23:22.194 --> 23:23.987
Oh, God. Sorry.

23:24.738 --> 23:25.864
It's just 'cause you--

23:26.490 --> 23:28.575
You know, you look like that--

23:29.159 --> 23:31.078
You know, the-- That--

23:31.745 --> 23:34.414
-You know, the fell--
-Yeah. Yeah, I know. The--

23:34.498 --> 23:37.584
-The Pakistani boy that was kidnapped.
-Yeah.

23:37.668 --> 23:39.211
Yeah, I get it.

23:39.294 --> 23:40.504
Had it all bloody day.

23:41.171 --> 23:43.507
But I suppose we all just look
the same to you people, right?

23:44.716 --> 23:47.845
No. No, I wasn't--
It's just 'cause I was thinking--

23:47.928 --> 23:50.180
Hey, I was just joking.

23:51.056 --> 23:52.057
Yeah.

23:52.641 --> 23:53.767
Sorry.

23:53.851 --> 23:55.519
How about I look at that cap
for you, yeah?

23:55.602 --> 23:57.980
Yeah, that'd be-- Yeah, thank you.

24:07.114 --> 24:08.323
Hey. Knock that off now.

24:09.324 --> 24:10.367
I'm sorry they're up.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.619
-It's all right. It's not your fault.
-Nah, nah!

24:12.703 --> 24:14.413
That's really stuck in there,
isn't it?

24:15.080 --> 24:16.373
There you go.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.959
Hey, thank you. Have a good wedding.

24:19.668 --> 24:21.211
Yeah, thanks.

24:21.295 --> 24:24.381
Just gotta get through a weekend
with these miserable morons first.

24:43.150 --> 24:44.610
Go and pay the man.

24:51.909 --> 24:53.827
Hey, thank you again, love.

24:56.705 --> 24:58.123
Hi.

25:00.417 --> 25:01.460
She's leaving.

25:02.085 --> 25:03.795
There's nothing to stop him from running.

25:16.391 --> 25:19.228
Shit. Look at the TV.

25:27.236 --> 25:28.529
Excuse me.

25:30.656 --> 25:32.407
For fuck's sake.

25:34.826 --> 25:36.036
Pump number?

25:43.877 --> 25:45.337
Pump number?

25:52.511 --> 25:53.720
Pump number one.

25:57.224 --> 25:59.226
It's 94.60.

26:07.818 --> 26:09.319
Keep the change.

26:09.403 --> 26:10.654
Really?

26:10.737 --> 26:11.864
Thanks, buddy.

26:19.705 --> 26:21.415
Go on. Go on, get in.

26:26.003 --> 26:27.004
Shut the door.

26:30.007 --> 26:31.008
Good job, kid.

26:31.884 --> 26:33.844
-Good job.
-Did you get any change?

26:35.262 --> 26:36.471
I gave him a tip.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.778
Thank you, Nick. You can leave us now.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.452
Three sugars. There's a love.

27:02.372 --> 27:04.374
Alan Black's body's been found.

27:05.709 --> 27:06.960
Alan Black?

27:08.795 --> 27:09.922
It rings a bell.

27:10.005 --> 27:12.674
Ex-Slow Horse. Your man.

27:12.758 --> 27:15.302
Clearly involved
in the kidnapping of Hassan Ahmed.

27:16.428 --> 27:20.224
But you see, I remember a conversation
we had on a bench earlier this evening,

27:20.307 --> 27:24.269
where you told me you had a guy
on the inside

27:24.353 --> 27:26.730
who had set the whole thing up.
So not my man.

27:26.813 --> 27:30.234
I have a statement from someone
who saw you and Black

27:30.317 --> 27:32.653
meeting after he'd left Slough House.

27:32.736 --> 27:35.531
Struan Loy? Bless.

27:35.614 --> 27:38.242
You think his word stacks up against mine?

27:38.325 --> 27:40.202
There'll be others.

27:40.285 --> 27:41.787
Standish will show.

27:41.870 --> 27:44.289
And she'll turn when she knows
why you're at Slough House.

27:44.998 --> 27:47.125
And Moody, dead

27:47.209 --> 27:49.336
after committing murder himself.

27:53.507 --> 27:55.008
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

27:56.760 --> 27:57.928
Sid Baker's gone.

28:06.603 --> 28:09.398
I'm gonna make you an offer, Jackson.

28:09.481 --> 28:10.732
I'm sure.

28:10.816 --> 28:13.151
I mean, obviously you have to have
this all wrapped up

28:13.235 --> 28:15.821
before Tearney lands,
and I can blow the whistle on you.

28:15.904 --> 28:17.531
You don't have a whistle.

28:18.448 --> 28:20.993
All you have is a CV littered
with dead joes.

28:21.076 --> 28:24.913
Well, I'm not sure your career
will survive the death of Hassan Ahmed.

28:24.997 --> 28:26.707
But anyway, make your pitch.

28:26.790 --> 28:30.002
I'm sure you've got some sweetener
to help me neck this absolute bullshit.

28:30.085 --> 28:33.881
Sign a statement that tallies with Loy's,
and that'll be the end of it.

28:33.964 --> 28:35.424
You mean the end of me.

28:35.507 --> 28:37.551
You'd be fired, but no charges.

28:37.634 --> 28:40.470
And enough of a pension to keep you
in single malts.

28:41.054 --> 28:44.349
A heavily redacted file will state
that you were thinking out loud

28:44.433 --> 28:46.226
and Black went rogue.

28:46.768 --> 28:47.936
When's Tearney get back?

28:48.020 --> 28:50.898
I mean, I'd love to run all this by her.

28:50.981 --> 28:53.275
Or we can sit here
and watch the Slow Horses

28:53.358 --> 28:57.029
walk in one by one and accept a job
back here at the Park,

28:57.112 --> 28:59.781
while you fester in the basement

28:59.865 --> 29:03.493
until this is all cleared up,
which I can make last a very long time.

29:03.577 --> 29:06.496
And if you get lonely,
I can always send Standish down.

29:08.123 --> 29:10.083
The treason charge against her
will be resurrected,

29:10.167 --> 29:11.960
and this time I can make it stick.

29:19.551 --> 29:21.386
I think I might have been bitten
at the canal.

29:25.474 --> 29:27.851
Well, it sounds like a wonderful deal.

29:28.477 --> 29:29.770
And hats off to you.

29:31.230 --> 29:32.898
You really got me boxed in.

29:34.983 --> 29:36.902
So print off a statement. Give me a pen.

29:38.278 --> 29:39.655
Fuck, I've just remembered.

29:40.656 --> 29:43.116
Yeah, there was something
I meant to tell you

29:43.200 --> 29:44.618
as soon as I walked in.

29:46.161 --> 29:48.580
The car that I returned.

29:48.664 --> 29:50.874
The one that's now parked in the basement.

29:51.792 --> 29:53.377
It's got a bomb in the boot.

30:05.681 --> 30:09.393
-But I would walk 500 miles
-Duffy.

30:38.505 --> 30:39.506
Fuck's sake.

30:50.559 --> 30:51.768
Fucking Lamb.

30:52.311 --> 30:53.562
What's he playing at?

30:58.192 --> 31:00.068
Shit. Secure the building!

31:00.152 --> 31:02.696
Search it floor by floor!
We've got an intruder!

31:04.072 --> 31:04.907
Door!

31:32.559 --> 31:36.146
-Now, tell me where the file is, please.
-What file? What are you even saying?

31:36.230 --> 31:37.606
Stop pissing around.
You know exactly what I mean.

31:37.689 --> 31:39.566
Whatever it is you think I have, I don't.

31:39.650 --> 31:41.652
Can you just put that thing down,
then we can--

31:43.362 --> 31:45.572
-Which one's the photograph in?
-What photograph?

31:45.656 --> 31:47.783
Taverner wanted me out
because she knew I took a photograph

31:47.866 --> 31:50.285
-of her and Alan Black.
-I don't know what you're talking about,

31:50.369 --> 31:52.412
but she had plenty of reasons
to want rid of you, mate.

31:52.496 --> 31:54.540
-You mean Stansted?
-Exactly. That's why you're out.

31:56.041 --> 31:58.836
I know what she did.
She got you to fuck me over at Stansted

31:58.919 --> 32:00.462
because she'd have
an excuse to get rid of me.

32:00.546 --> 32:02.005
It was your fiasco.

32:02.589 --> 32:06.218
Now, I'm pretty sure that she'll have
asked you to destroy that photograph.

32:06.301 --> 32:08.929
And I'm even more sure that
you'll have kept a copy for insurance.

32:09.012 --> 32:12.182
So tell me where they are, and then
I won't shoot you straight in the face.

32:13.267 --> 32:14.434
Sorry, mate. You lost me.

32:18.313 --> 32:19.606
Tell me where it is.

32:21.108 --> 32:22.150
Hey!

32:27.197 --> 32:28.574
Come on, come on, come on.

32:29.908 --> 32:31.159
Black.

32:31.743 --> 32:34.830
Black, Black, Black.

32:39.126 --> 32:40.460
Come on. Come on.

32:44.131 --> 32:45.007
Come on.

32:58.270 --> 32:59.271
No.

33:06.403 --> 33:09.323
All teams. All teams.
Evacuate workstations.

33:09.406 --> 33:14.286
Please start approaching a secure area
with passes and ID.

33:14.369 --> 33:16.205
This is a 1470…

33:16.288 --> 33:18.123
-Move! Move!
-Come on! Let's go!

33:18.207 --> 33:20.250
All right, everybody out this way!

33:29.009 --> 33:30.219
Stansted.

33:34.848 --> 33:37.017
-Move! Get out!
-Move! Move! Move! This way!

33:37.559 --> 33:38.560
Move!

33:38.644 --> 33:43.732
Stansted. Stansted, Stansted.

33:49.196 --> 33:55.202
Motherf-- Fiasco.

33:57.204 --> 33:58.205
Yeah.

34:02.042 --> 34:03.043
-Clear.
-Move.

34:03.126 --> 34:04.336
We're evacuating this area.

34:04.419 --> 34:05.629
Move!

34:05.712 --> 34:07.714
-Move, move, move.
-Out, out, out!

34:13.846 --> 34:15.889
-Coming through!
-Clear out!

34:19.141 --> 34:20.185
Out of the way!

34:25.440 --> 34:27.525
All clear! Out! Out!

34:27.609 --> 34:29.069
-Move!
-Move!

34:31.405 --> 34:33.532
Webb, we have a code 1470!

34:40.539 --> 34:43.458
-Down!
-Down! On the floor.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.840
…extremely worrying,
and added to the investigation…

34:54.136 --> 34:55.762
This is yours, I believe.

34:58.765 --> 35:01.518
Yeah. Must have forgot
to attach the bomb part.

35:04.396 --> 35:06.857
Duffy and his men are sweeping
the building as we speak.

35:06.940 --> 35:09.151
I assume it was Cartwright
you smuggled in.

35:09.234 --> 35:12.487
Nah, I thought it was helpful
to test your security.

35:12.571 --> 35:15.449
I've got bad news.
Your guys are not very good.

35:21.079 --> 35:23.165
Put him in the basement, next to Loy.

35:25.876 --> 35:27.461
You got the gist of that.

35:27.544 --> 35:31.173
Yeah. Well, if my guys
were as good as your guys,

35:31.256 --> 35:32.799
they'd be your guys.

35:32.883 --> 35:36.803
Now that little interlude is over,
perhaps you'd like to sign this.

35:42.434 --> 35:44.603
Before I do that, I just got one question.

35:44.686 --> 35:47.231
Who the fuck have you just
sent to the basement?

35:48.565 --> 35:49.566
Ma'am.

35:50.567 --> 35:52.194
-Good?
-Yeah.

35:52.277 --> 35:54.571
Oh, no. I wouldn't do that, ma'am.

35:55.614 --> 35:56.740
Fiasco.

36:06.208 --> 36:09.837
In three seconds, I could have
a dozen guns pointed at your heads.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.505
Yeah, but you won't do that.

36:12.005 --> 36:14.591
Because you don't want anyone
to see these.

36:17.678 --> 36:18.679
Here, look.

36:19.555 --> 36:23.225
There's you, and there's Alan Black.

36:24.643 --> 36:27.563
Remember setting up the thing
you're accusing me of?

36:28.397 --> 36:32.568
Kidnapping Hassan Ahmed
in a false flag operation

36:32.651 --> 36:36.989
so you could rescue him,
look good and score some points.

36:37.698 --> 36:41.451
You did tell me all that earlier,
but this is evidence.

36:42.202 --> 36:45.914
Yeah, I've put your name in.
If you'd just initial the changes.

36:45.998 --> 36:47.332
Sign at the bottom.

36:48.584 --> 36:51.128
I met with an ex-agent.
That means nothing.

36:51.211 --> 36:54.423
You won't mind if we
send this to Tearney then?

36:54.506 --> 36:57.217
-And everyone else at the Park.
-And Hobden, while we're at it.

36:57.301 --> 37:00.137
No, no. Hobden's a kook.
Send it to all the news desks.

37:00.220 --> 37:02.347
-News desks.
-What do you want?

37:02.431 --> 37:04.099
I want that kid found alive.

37:04.183 --> 37:05.309
And you think I don't?

37:05.392 --> 37:10.189
I think your attention's been split
between finding him and burning me.

37:14.318 --> 37:18.363
There are three possible vehicles.
We have lost track of all of them.

37:18.447 --> 37:20.616
We are doing everything we can.

37:20.699 --> 37:22.367
There's something more you could do.

37:22.451 --> 37:23.827
Cartwright got Hobden's phone.

37:23.911 --> 37:27.539
It turns out there's a certain someone
he called when it all went to shit.

37:28.457 --> 37:31.793
Maybe you should pay that someone a visit.

37:40.761 --> 37:44.556
Hey, this deal with your uncle,
how much money we talking?

37:45.474 --> 37:46.892
Well, name your price.

37:47.643 --> 37:49.186
What is he? A billionaire?

37:49.269 --> 37:53.148
No, he's got businesses
and lots of investments. Lots.

37:53.232 --> 37:56.109
Oh, yeah? Well, how come
he never helped you out before?

37:56.902 --> 37:59.279
You was living in a right shitheap
back in Leeds.

38:01.114 --> 38:04.243
He said he wanted me
to make my own way, like he did.

38:05.118 --> 38:06.870
But he wouldn't want me hurt.

38:06.954 --> 38:08.121
He wouldn't want me hurt.

38:08.205 --> 38:10.123
Hey, listen. Listen, why would he lie?

38:10.958 --> 38:13.418
Like you said,
he better not be bullshitting.

38:13.502 --> 38:16.547
Because if there is no uncle
and there is no money,

38:16.630 --> 38:19.132
-we're gonna find out, you know?
-The money will be there, I swear.

38:19.216 --> 38:22.344
-Okay? I promise it's there. My uncle--
-Yeah, all right, all right. All right!

38:22.427 --> 38:23.720
Jesus.

38:25.180 --> 38:26.974
Look, he did well at the petrol station.

38:27.558 --> 38:29.184
You did.

38:29.268 --> 38:31.436
So I'll give him
the benefit of the doubt.

38:32.646 --> 38:34.064
He can come with us.

38:35.482 --> 38:39.236
But only if he makes me laugh.

38:43.699 --> 38:44.741
If he fucking what?

38:46.451 --> 38:48.579
He's a comedian, isn't he?

38:49.621 --> 38:53.125
Well, I say "comedian."
He's never had the balls to go on stage.

38:55.335 --> 38:56.628
Come on, now!

38:56.712 --> 38:58.589
This is your big chance.
You wanna come with us, don't ya?

38:58.672 --> 39:01.133
-Roast us like on Comedy Central.
-Make us laugh.

39:01.216 --> 39:02.217
Go on!

39:03.135 --> 39:04.887
-Waiting.
-Okay, okay.

39:10.475 --> 39:13.478
So you're the Sons of Albion, huh?

39:15.272 --> 39:16.523
Just a hunch,

39:16.607 --> 39:18.942
but is Albion married to his first cousin?

39:20.485 --> 39:21.778
That's just fucking rude.

39:21.862 --> 39:23.906
That's the point. It's insults.

39:25.657 --> 39:26.575
Go on.

39:28.243 --> 39:29.620
"The Sons of Albion."

39:30.495 --> 39:32.581
Because "Unfuckable White Men
with Daddy Issues"

39:32.664 --> 39:34.541
doesn't quite fit on a neck tattoo,
does it?

39:36.627 --> 39:37.628
Dear me.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.383
I guess you got what you wanted.

39:44.384 --> 39:45.552
A Muslim bombing.

39:51.850 --> 39:53.310
Now, that's good.

39:53.393 --> 39:55.646
That is good. More.

39:57.689 --> 39:59.900
The Sons of Albion:

39:59.983 --> 40:02.986
Saving Great Britain from the infidels
Monday to Thursday,

40:03.612 --> 40:05.864
but can't resist a good curry
on a Friday night.

40:09.201 --> 40:10.410
He's talking about us!

40:11.954 --> 40:13.997
You know there's
1.8 billion Muslims in the world?

40:14.081 --> 40:15.457
-Yeah?
-He's on a roll.

40:15.541 --> 40:17.459
You're gonna need a bigger van, mate.

40:19.378 --> 40:21.296
Hey, do him.

40:21.380 --> 40:22.214
Do him.

40:22.297 --> 40:23.465
-Go on. Go on.
-Look at him.

40:23.549 --> 40:25.217
If he was any more inbred,
he'd be a sandwich.

40:26.677 --> 40:29.388
Another one! Another one!
This guy! Another one!

40:29.471 --> 40:32.808
And this one, he's so dumb,
he's got a note in his underpants:

40:32.891 --> 40:34.059
"Wipe arse. Use paper."

40:36.270 --> 40:37.271
Hey!

40:38.856 --> 40:40.357
You're fucking funny!

40:40.440 --> 40:42.484
He's laughing now! He's laughing--

40:42.568 --> 40:43.569
God!

40:44.236 --> 40:47.155
He's laughing now? He's laughing!

40:51.577 --> 40:52.744
Fuck!

41:07.301 --> 41:08.802
Now that's fucking funny.
