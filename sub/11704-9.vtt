{\an8}- THAT'S WHY I TELL EVERYBODY,
"LET'S WALK."

04:04.744 --> 04:06.704
{\an8}IT'S SEASIDE.
TROUBLE'S ALWAYS GONNA FIND YOU.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.290

18:30.901 --> 18:32.778
{\an8}NO, THAT'S NOT COOL, THAT'S
NOT COOL, THAT'S NOT COOL!

18:32.861 --> 18:34.112
{\an8}OH, [bleep]!
THAT'S NOT COOL!

18:34.196 --> 18:36.657
{\an8}THAT'S NOT COOL,
THAT'S NOT COOL!

18:36.740 --> 18:40.327
{\an8}OH! THE LAST PERSON
I WANNA SEE IS MY EX.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.453
{\an8}NO, THAT'S NOT COOL.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.205
{\an8}THE FACT
THAT HE SAID NOTHING TO ME,

18:43.288 --> 18:44.873
{\an8}THAT WAS REALLY HARD.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.291
{\an8}I'VE BEEN WITH YOU
FOR, LIKE, EIGHT MONTHS.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.211
{\an8}YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO, LIKE,
COME DOWN NICELY AND SAY HI?

18:49.294 --> 18:52.381
{\an8}I STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU,
AND YOU'RE TOTALLY IGNORING ME.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.383
{\an8}YOU KNOW,
[bleep] THAT [bleep].

18:54.466 --> 18:57.678
{\an8}SO [bleep] PISSED OFF.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.555
{\an8}- TO US.

18:59.638 --> 19:00.973
{\an8}- YEAH?

19:01.056 --> 19:03.183
{\an8}[clink]
- US PAST THE JERSEY SHORE.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.102
{\an8}- I CAN'T WAIT TO [bleep] LEAVE.
HONESTLY, I HATE EVERYONE.

19:05.185 --> 19:07.896
{\an8}- LISTEN, IF A GUY
DOESN'T LIKE YOU,

19:07.980 --> 19:09.273
{\an8}IT'S CALLED [bleep] YOU,

19:09.356 --> 19:10.983
{\an8}AND THERE'S SO MANY
PEOPLE OUT THERE IN THE WORLD

19:11.066 --> 19:12.276
{\an8}THAT'S GONNA LIKE YOU FOR YOU.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.157
{\an8}- OH, STOP [bleep] CRYING.
YOU'RE SO STUPID.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.910
{\an8}OF COURSE,
I HAD TO SEE THAT [bleep].

19:21.994 --> 19:25.581
{\an8}OF COURSE.
[sniffles]

19:25.664 --> 19:26.748
{\an8}I'M NOT SURE IF I'M STILL
IN LOVE WITH JUSTIN,

19:26.832 --> 19:29.251
{\an8}BUT I KNOW THAT
THERE'S STILL FEELINGS THERE.

19:29.334 --> 19:32.379
{\an8}[whining]

19:35.924 --> 19:38.594
{\an8}MY EX IS AN [bleep, bleep].

19:41.096 --> 19:44.808
{\an8}I HAVE NO DATE TONIGHT.
LIKE I'M A [bleep] LOSER.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.184
{\an8}I WAS LOOKING FOR LOVE.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.185
{\an8}I WAS LOOKING FOR,
YOU KNOW,

19:47.269 --> 19:50.439
{\an8}JUST LIKE A SUMMER
ROMANCE, I GUESS.

19:50.522 --> 19:51.607
{\an8}BUT IT DIDN'T WORK OUT
THAT WAY.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.108
{\an8}IT SUCKS.

19:53.192 --> 19:57.237
{\an8}I HATE GUYS.
I SHOULD BE A [bleep] LESBIAN.

20:02.034 --> 20:02.409
{\an8}[whistle blows]

20:07.372 --> 20:08.123
{\an8}[buzzer]
both: OH!

20:08.206 --> 20:10.709
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD!
21 TO 22.

20:10.792 --> 20:14.087
{\an8}THAT WAS CRAZY.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.714
{\an8}- NEXT PLAY, WAIT.

20:15.797 --> 20:18.634
{\an8}IT'S BROS' NIGHT TONIGHT
AT CAPTAIN HOOKS.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.136
{\an8}IT'S GOT LIKE
SOME AIR HOCKEY GAMES,

20:21.219 --> 20:22.471
{\an8}SOME BASKETBALL GAMES.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.515
{\an8}IT'S SORT OF LIKE
A CHUCK E. CHEESE FOR DUDES.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.725
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.352
{\an8}THERE WE GO.

20:28.435 --> 20:32.189
{\an8}[laughing]

20:32.272 --> 20:33.315
{\an8}- WE STAYED BOYS
THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE THING.

20:33.398 --> 20:37.194
{\an8}THIS BOND THAT WE SHARE
BRINGS US TOGETHER,

20:37.277 --> 20:39.488
{\an8}AND NO ONE CAN EVER
TAKE THAT AWAY FROM US EVER.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.198
{\an8}LIKE, WE TAKE THAT WITH US
FOR LIFE, THAT BOND.

20:41.281 --> 20:43.909
{\an8}THAT WAS DEEP.
THAT WAS [bleep] DEEP.

20:43.992 --> 20:48.622
{\an8}YO, IT'S OUR LAST NIGHT.
IT'S OUR LAST NIGHT FOR REAL.

20:48.705 --> 20:49.831
{\an8}- THIS [bleep] SUMMER'S
BEEN CRAZY, THOUGH.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.668
{\an8}- WE DID OUR THING, THOUGH.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.169
{\an8}FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES,
WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO

20:54.252 --> 20:55.837
{\an8}LOOK AND BE LIKE,
WOW, LOOK AT THAT.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.381
{\an8}WE HAD AN AWESOME TIME.

20:57.464 --> 20:59.883
{\an8}AND ALL THE CRAZY [bleep]
WE DID...

20:59.967 --> 21:01.343
{\an8}I WON'T TAKE IT BACK.
NEVER. NEVER.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.887
{\an8}- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET INTO AFTER THIS?

21:03.971 --> 21:05.180
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

21:05.263 --> 21:07.015
{\an8}I DEFINITELY WANT
TO VISIT RHODE ISLAND.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.392
{\an8}- YEAH, YOU GOT TO.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.435
{\an8}ME AND VINNY WILL CARPOOL.

21:10.519 --> 21:11.895
{\an8}AND WE'LL--

21:11.979 --> 21:14.189
{\an8}FIVE HOURS WITH YOU IN A CAR.

21:14.272 --> 21:16.024
{\an8}- YEAH, GET THE [bleep]

21:30.247 --> 21:31.707
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE IT IS THE PERFECT
PLACE TO GO TO

21:31.790 --> 21:33.834
{\an8}LIKE SOMEWHERE
OUT OF SEASIDE,

21:33.917 --> 21:36.294
{\an8}LIKE WE'RE GETTING AWAY

21:40.257 --> 21:41.591
{\an8}- SAM'S HYSTERICAL.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.051

21:44.469 --> 21:45.637
{\an8}I THINK SHE GETS
MORE AND MORE BEAUTIFUL.

21:45.721 --> 21:48.557
{\an8}I'VE NEVER REALLY FOUND THAT

21:48.640 --> 21:50.434

{\an8}THINK ABOUT IT,
LIKE FOR A MONTH...

22:20.255 --> 22:22.966
{\an8}- WE LIVED WITH EACH OTHER
EVERY DAY.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.342

{\an8}I HATE EVERYONE.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.564
{\an8}- BABE, YOU HAVE A DAY LEFT.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.066
{\an8}IT'S OKAY, IT'S NOT THE END OF

23:29.908 --> 23:32.327

{\an8}I'M GONNA HANG OUT WITH THE
ROOMIES, OKAY?

23:41.086 --> 23:42.504
{\an8}YOU WANNA HANG OUT WITH US?

23:42.587 --> 23:45.507

{\an8}- SNOOKI CAN'T FIND A DATE.

24:02.149 --> 24:05.861
{\an8}SHE RAN INTO HER EX-BOYFRIEND
AND SHE'S REALLY UPSET.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.947

24:12.159 --> 24:14.411
{\an8}I KNOW YOU WANTED TO.

24:14.494 --> 24:15.871

24:54.451 --> 24:56.745
{\an8}- SNOOKS HAS A BAD NIGHT
TONIGHT.

24:56.828 --> 24:59.247
{\an8}- WHY, WHAT DID
THE EX-BOYFRIEND DO?

24:59.331 --> 25:02.500
{\an8}YOU KNOW I'LL DO IT.
FOR FUN.

25:02.584 --> 25:05.795
{\an8}- NO, DON'T DO THAT.

{\an8}SITUATION'S NUMBER ONE GIRL.
[laughing]

25:33.114 --> 25:35.283
{\an8}- THE SITUATION
THOUGHT HE WAS SLICK

25:35.367 --> 25:38.078
{\an8}BY HIDING A BOWL OF CHEESE
UNDER MY BED,

25:38.161 --> 25:40.789
{\an8}AND I SAID THAT
I WOULD GET HIM BACK FOR IT.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.290
{\an8}[laughing]

25:42.374 --> 25:44.960
{\an8}SO I GOT THIS DISGUSTING,
UGLY-FACED BULLDOG.

25:45.043 --> 25:46.461
{\an8}I PUT A T-SHIRT ON IT
AND I WROTE ON THE T-SHIRT,

25:46.544 --> 25:49.089
{\an8}"THE SITUATION'S
NUMBER ONE GIRL."

25:49.172 --> 25:50.382
{\an8}- AS SOON AS HE COMES UP HERE,
HE HAS TO SEE IT.

25:50.465 --> 25:52.634
{\an8}- AW, THAT'S SO FUNNY.

25:52.717 --> 25:55.053
{\an8}- THIS SIGNIFIES THAT THESE ARE
WHAT ALL THE GIRLS

25:55.136 --> 25:57.430
{\an8}MIKE BRINGS HOME LOOKS LIKE.

25:57.514 --> 25:58.723
{\an8}- THAT'S PAYBACK RIGHT THERE.

25:58.807 --> 26:03.770
{\an8}- THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT, RIGHT?
[laughing]

26:03.853 --> 26:07.899
{\an8}- [coughing]
[laughing]

26:07.983 --> 26:09.317
{\an8}- WHAT THE [bleep]?

26:09.401 --> 26:11.152
{\an8}- MIKE IS [bleep], FIRST OF ALL,
SO STUPID

26:11.236 --> 26:12.320
{\an8}THAT HE BACKS UP INTO IT.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.989
{\an8}HE DOESN'T EVEN REALIZE
THAT IT'S HANGING

26:14.072 --> 26:15.115
{\an8}FROM THE CEILING
ABOVE HIS HEAD.

26:15.198 --> 26:17.701
{\an8}IT'S THE [bleep]
FUNNIEST THING.

26:17.784 --> 26:21.037
{\an8}- WHAT?

26:21.121 --> 26:22.872
{\an8}IS THAT A HIPPO?

26:22.956 --> 26:28.586
{\an8}- THAT'S THE FIRST CHICK
YOU BROUGHT HOME THAT NIGHT.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.214
{\an8}"THE SITUATION'S
NUMBER ONE GIRL."

26:31.298 --> 26:34.342
{\an8}I LIKE THAT.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.510
{\an8}I LAUGH IT OFF,

26:35.593 --> 26:37.012
{\an8}BECAUSE NOTHING
REALLY BOTHERS ME.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.305
{\an8}I MEAN, IT JUST--
WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME,

26:38.388 --> 26:41.433
{\an8}IS THAT I'M ON YOUR MIND 24/7.

26:41.516 --> 26:42.600
{\an8}YOU MIGHT AS WELL
PUT THAT ON YOURSELF--

26:42.684 --> 26:44.644
{\an8}THAT SAYS
"SITUATION'S NUMBER ONE GIRL."

26:44.728 --> 26:46.354
{\an8}- MIKE, THAT WAS MY PAYBACK
FOR, UH,

26:46.438 --> 26:48.356
{\an8}PUTTING THE CHEESE
UNDER MY BED, BRO.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.150
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, COOL.
I'M DOWN.

26:50.233 --> 26:52.068
{\an8}- I ACTUALLY RESPECT MIKE
A LITTLE MORE NOW,

26:52.152 --> 26:54.154
{\an8}BECAUSE HE LAUGHED AT ME
SAYING THAT HE BRINGS HOME

26:54.237 --> 26:58.199
{\an8}BULL-DOG-LOOKING GIRLS.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.993
{\an8}[bleep].
[laughing]

27:02.454 --> 27:03.705
{\an8}- LET'S GO IN THE HOT TUB.

27:03.788 --> 27:06.082
{\an8}- I CAN'T DRINK ANYMORE.
I'M GOING TO BED.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.335
{\an8}- NO HOT TUB?

27:08.418 --> 27:09.794
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S KINDA COLD OUT THERE.

27:09.878 --> 27:10.837
{\an8}- TOO COLD FOR ME.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.673
{\an8}- WHAT THE [bleep]?

27:13.757 --> 27:15.133
{\an8}I'M DOWN FOR THE HOT TUB.

27:15.216 --> 27:16.885
{\an8}THE SUMMER IS LIKE,
ALMOST OVER.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.971
{\an8}LIKE, WHY CAN'T WE
DO SOMETHING CRAZY?

27:20.055 --> 27:23.099
{\an8}[bleep], LIVE YOUR LIFE.
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

27:28.855 --> 27:31.608
{\an8}- [laughing]

27:31.691 --> 27:33.693
{\an8}WHY IS EVERYONE INSIDE
SITTING ON THE COUCH?

27:33.777 --> 27:35.153
{\an8}- NOT ANYBODY AS WILD AS WE--
ME AND SNICKS.

27:35.236 --> 27:37.238
{\an8}- I DON'T CARE!

27:37.322 --> 27:38.531
{\an8}- I GOT ON SNOOKS
A LITTLE BIT

27:38.615 --> 27:39.949
{\an8}THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

27:40.033 --> 27:42.660
{\an8}I WAS JUST FOOLING AROUND
WITH HER.

27:42.744 --> 27:44.245
{\an8}SHE'S A CUTE GIRL,
SHE KNOWS HOW TO HAVE FUN.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.081
{\an8}WE GET ALONG REAL GOOD
AND, UM, I LOVE HER.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.416
{\an8}- TIE ME [bleep].

27:48.500 --> 27:50.418
{\an8}- OKAY, LET'S UNTIE IT--
LET ME GRAB THIS FOR YOU.

27:50.502 --> 27:54.089
{\an8}HOLD ON, LET ME GET THIS ONE.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.423
{\an8}HAIRS THIS WAY...

27:55.507 --> 27:56.674
{\an8}ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

27:56.758 --> 27:58.927
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.
I'M NAKED RIGHT NOW.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.262
{\an8}FIRST YOU REMOVED
MY [bleep] PANTS.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.932
{\an8}- SNOOKS WAS LOOKING TO HAVE
A GOOD TIME IN THE JACUZZI.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.100
{\an8}AND YOU KNOW,
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

28:05.183 --> 28:06.851
{\an8}SNOOK'S CLOTHES
JUST STARTED COMING OFF.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.353
{\an8}ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
LET'S PUT THIS ON--

28:08.436 --> 28:09.771
{\an8}--LET'S PUT
THIS BATHING SUIT ON.

28:09.854 --> 28:11.356
{\an8}ALL RIGHT,
LET ME GRAB THAT FOR YOU.

28:11.439 --> 28:14.150
{\an8}- I'M DRUNK.

28:14.234 --> 28:15.819
{\an8}NO, I'M SERIOUS, YOU [bleep]!

28:15.902 --> 28:17.320
{\an8}- I MEAN,
SHE WAS TOTALLY BUTT NAKED

28:17.404 --> 28:20.615
{\an8}HERE AND THERE--
I JUST DIDN'T WANNA...

28:20.698 --> 28:21.950
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

28:22.033 --> 28:23.118
{\an8}- TRY ME.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.411
{\an8}- TRY A--IF YOU'RE HUNGRY,
TRY A SNICKERS?

28:24.494 --> 28:26.913
{\an8}- YEAH, TRY ME.
- [laughing]

28:36.965 --> 28:38.133
{\an8}- WE HOOKED UP.

28:38.216 --> 28:39.634
{\an8}I DON'T GIVE A [bleep],
LIKE, WHATEVER.

28:39.717 --> 28:42.887
{\an8}IT'S THE END OF SUMMER,
WHATEVER.

28:57.026 --> 28:58.736
{\an8}AH!

28:58.820 --> 29:02.115
{\an8}- LET ME JUST JUMP OUT
REAL QUICK.

29:02.198 --> 29:05.785
{\an8}I HAVE TO PEE,
BUT I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

29:05.869 --> 29:06.870
{\an8}I WAS THINKING ABOUT
MAYBE GETTING DOWN WITH SNOOKS

29:06.953 --> 29:10.165
{\an8}REAL QUICK, BUT THEN I WAS LIKE,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:10.248 --> 29:10.999
{\an8}IT'S LIKE--
ALMOST LIKE MY LITTLE SISTER,

29:11.082 --> 29:16.504
{\an8}AND, UM,
YOU DON'T DO THAT.

29:16.588 --> 29:20.049
{\an8}- SO I DID THE SAME THING THAT I
DID THE FIRST NIGHT, BASICALLY.

29:20.133 --> 29:22.886
{\an8}I FIGURED, I COME IN WITH
A BANG, I LEAVE WITH A BANG.

29:22.969 --> 29:24.387
{\an8}OOPS.

29:28.975 --> 29:30.351
{\an8}- MAYBE WE SHOULD
GET A SHORE HOUSE NEXT--

29:30.435 --> 29:31.060
{\an8}NEXT SUMMER.

29:31.144 --> 29:34.522
{\an8}ALL OF US.
[cheering]

29:34.606 --> 29:36.191
{\an8}- LET'S DO IT.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.779
{\an8}- PROBABLY GONNA
DO THE SAUSAGE AND PEPPERS

29:41.863 --> 29:43.198
{\an8}AND THE ONIONS, SO WE--
WE DON'T HAVE TO,

29:43.281 --> 29:45.200
{\an8}LIKE, GRILL IT,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

29:45.283 --> 29:46.951
{\an8}- SITUATION'S LAST DINNER.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.203
{\an8}- A LITTLE PEPPERS,
A LITTLE POTATOES--

29:48.286 --> 29:49.704
{\an8}YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT
THE POTATOES--

29:49.787 --> 29:51.372
{\an8}I'M PROBABLY NOT,
BUT I'M GONNA THROW THAT IN.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.541
{\an8}- [bleep] LOOKS GOOD.

29:53.625 --> 29:54.626
{\an8}SITUATION'S IN THE KITCHEN
DOING HIS THING,

29:54.709 --> 29:57.253
{\an8}COOKING UP SOME
SAUSAGE AND POTATOES

29:57.337 --> 29:58.671
{\an8}WE GOT VINNY ON THE GRILL
DOING HIS THING.

29:58.755 --> 30:02.091
{\an8}JWOWW'S, LIKE, PUTTING TOGETHER
SOME SALAD AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

30:02.175 --> 30:04.719
{\an8}WE'RE GONNA HAVE LIKE A
NICE LITTLE BARBECUE.

30:04.802 --> 30:09.224
{\an8}- OH, YEAH.
- STACKERS, HUH?

30:09.307 --> 30:11.893
{\an8}- I DON'T LIKE
THE SHRIVELED UP ONES.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.895
{\an8}- GOOD TO KNOW.
PAULY, YOU HEARD THAT?

30:13.978 --> 30:15.605
{\an8}- LOOKS REALLY GOOD.

30:15.688 --> 30:17.440
{\an8}- SO GUYS, THIS IS OUR
LAST DINNER TOGETHER.

30:17.524 --> 30:18.316
{\an8}- I KNOW.
I CAN'T PROCESS IT.

30:18.399 --> 30:19.359
{\an8}AM I THE ONLY ONE?

30:19.442 --> 30:21.444
{\an8}- IT REALLY WENT BY.

30:21.528 --> 30:22.570
{\an8}- NAH,
I CAN'T PROCESS IT, EITHER.

30:22.654 --> 30:23.696
{\an8}- I DON'T ACTUALLY EVEN
REMEMBER ANYTHING.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.698
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE IT WAS JUST
A LITTLE BLURRY.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.408
{\an8}- I REMEMBER FIRST DAY.

30:27.492 --> 30:28.826
{\an8}- I REMEMBER THE
NAKED CONNECTICUT CHICKS.

30:28.910 --> 30:31.329
{\an8}- CONNECTICUT CHICKS?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

30:31.412 --> 30:33.039
{\an8}- NAKED HOT TUB
CONNECTICUT CHICKS.

30:33.122 --> 30:34.707
{\an8}- SAM, GUESS WHO YOU WERE
RIGHT NEXT TO DURING THAT.

30:34.791 --> 30:38.086
{\an8}[overlapping chatter]
- ANGELINA.

30:38.169 --> 30:39.254
{\an8}- YOU GUYS CAN GO AT IT.

30:39.337 --> 30:40.088
{\an8}THOSE WERE THE BIGGEST FIGHTS
IN THE HOUSE.

30:40.171 --> 30:40.922
{\an8}- THOSE WERE THE BEST FIGHTS.

30:41.005 --> 30:44.759
{\an8}UNTIL AC.
- YEAH, UNTIL AC.

30:44.842 --> 30:47.762
{\an8}- YO, AC WAS LIKE HOLYFIELD
AND TYSON.

30:47.845 --> 30:49.264
{\an8}YOU GOT THIS
SPINNING BACK HAND.

30:49.347 --> 30:50.056
{\an8}- YEAH.

30:50.139 --> 30:51.683
{\an8}- ALL OF THE SUDDEN YOU HEAR...

30:51.766 --> 30:55.436
{\an8}I WAS LIKE, WHOA!

30:55.520 --> 30:56.813
{\an8}- THEN YOU HEARD ME SCREAMING.

30:56.896 --> 30:58.481
{\an8}"WHOA, YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HIT ME LIKE A DUDE?

30:58.565 --> 31:03.486
{\an8}[laughing]

31:03.570 --> 31:06.656
{\an8}- I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH--
I HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK.

31:06.739 --> 31:07.782
{\an8}- HELL, YEAH.

31:07.865 --> 31:09.784
{\an8}- A LOT OF LAUGHS--
A LOT OF LAUGHS.

31:09.867 --> 31:10.910
{\an8}- UPS AND DOWNS.

31:10.994 --> 31:11.953
{\an8}- THAT'S HOW SUMMER
ALWAYS IS ANYWAY.

31:12.036 --> 31:14.289
{\an8}- A LOT OF LAUGHS THOUGH.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.708
{\an8}- YEAH.
THAT'S TRUE.

31:16.791 --> 31:19.460
{\an8}- OH, I'M GONNA MISS YOU GUYS.
- OH.

31:19.544 --> 31:21.546
{\an8}- OUR LAST NIGHT IN SEASIDE.

31:21.629 --> 31:24.048
{\an8}WE STOOD TOGETHER AS A FAMILY,
ALL THE ROOMMATES.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.134
{\an8}WE'VE ALL GROWN
VERY CLOSE TOGETHER.

31:26.217 --> 31:29.137
{\an8}I MEAN, IT'S SAD, LIKE,
I'M NOT GONNA LIE--SAD.

31:29.220 --> 31:33.099
{\an8}- THIS WAS THE SHORTEST SUMMER
I THINK I EVER LIVED FOR.

31:33.182 --> 31:37.562
{\an8}- IT'S NOTHING ANYONE WOULD
EVER EVEN IMAGINE,

31:37.645 --> 31:38.896
{\an8}UNLESS YOU DO IT YOURSELF.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.690
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

31:40.773 --> 31:42.525
{\an8}- THIS IS IT.

31:42.609 --> 31:44.652
{\an8}- WE'LL NEVER
EXPERIENCE THIS AGAIN.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.487
{\an8}LIKE, YOU'LL NEVER EXPERIENCE
THIS WITH ANYONE ELSE

31:46.571 --> 31:48.239
{\an8}BUT WHO'S IN THIS ROOM
RIGHT NOW.

31:48.323 --> 31:49.949
{\an8}- YOU LOVE IT.

31:50.033 --> 31:52.201
{\an8}- SNOOKERS IS FUNNY.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.621
{\an8}- THIS WHOLE SUMMER HAS BEEN
PRETTY WILD.

31:54.704 --> 31:56.998
{\an8}PRETTY CRAZY--LOTS OF FIGHTS.

31:57.081 --> 31:59.792
{\an8}LOTS OF HOOK-UPS.
LOTS OF DRAMA.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.419
{\an8}HEY THERE,
YOU ARE A REAL [bleep].

32:01.502 --> 32:03.671
{\an8}- WHATEVER, MIKE.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.465
{\an8}- THEY'RE TAKING THEIR
UNDERWEAR OFF

32:05.548 --> 32:06.215
{\an8}IN THE [bleep] JACUZZI--
ARE YOU DUMB?

32:06.299 --> 32:08.134
{\an8}HELLO?

32:08.217 --> 32:09.427
{\an8}- ALL THE NIGHTS WE WENT OUT.

32:09.510 --> 32:11.095
{\an8}WE TOOK THE NIGHT--
WE DEFINITELY DID.

32:14.974 --> 32:16.684
{\an8}- WHOO, YEAH!

32:16.768 --> 32:17.685
{\an8}- THE GIRL SITUATION
THIS SUMMER WAS GOOD.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.355
{\an8}I MEAN, I MET A LOT OF GIRLS.

32:20.438 --> 32:23.358
{\an8}BUT I JUST DON'T HOOK UP
WITH GRENADES, COME ON.

32:23.441 --> 32:24.859
{\an8}IT'S JUST NOT ME.
[laughing]

32:24.942 --> 32:27.987
{\an8}[overlapping shouting]

32:28.071 --> 32:30.323
{\an8}- THE REALITY IS,
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT,

32:30.406 --> 32:31.949
{\an8}I CONSIDER THIS HOUSE A FAMILY.

32:32.033 --> 32:33.076
{\an8}- SALUTE TO BEING ITALIAN.

32:33.159 --> 32:35.620
{\an8}OUR WHOLE SUMMER
WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLE.

32:35.703 --> 32:36.871
{\an8}DOWN HERE AT THE SHORE,
ONE MINUTE YOU GOT THREE GIRLS

32:36.954 --> 32:38.873
{\an8}IN THE JACUZZI,
THE NEXT MINUTE

32:38.956 --> 32:41.376
{\an8}SOMEBODY'S IN JAIL
AND YOU HAVE TO BAIL THEM OUT.

32:41.459 --> 32:43.461
{\an8}THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
DOWN AT THE SHORE.

32:43.544 --> 32:46.214
{\an8}- I DID THIS, YOU KNOW, LIKE,
I WAS PART OF THE JERSEY SHORE.

32:46.297 --> 32:47.715
{\an8}AND THERE WAS UPS AND DOWNS
AND WE HAD

32:47.799 --> 32:51.010
{\an8}AN EXPERIENCE THAT WAS
TOTALLY UNLIKE ANYTHING ELSE.

32:51.094 --> 32:53.179
{\an8}THAT WAS JUST
THE SICKEST MEMORY OF MY LIFE.

32:53.262 --> 32:54.138
{\an8}- THIS WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.557
{\an8}WE'LL NEVER, LIKE,
BE, LIKE,

32:56.641 --> 32:58.351
{\an8}IN THIS AWESOME HOUSE
TOGETHER AGAIN.

32:58.434 --> 33:01.229
{\an8}- OH!

33:01.312 --> 33:02.897
{\an8}[overlapping shouting]

33:02.980 --> 33:03.523
{\an8}- [bleep]

33:03.606 --> 33:09.320
{\an8}[laughing]

33:09.404 --> 33:10.988
{\an8}- [indistinct]
- [screaming]

33:11.072 --> 33:13.408
{\an8}- DEFINITELY MEMORIES
THAT NO ONE CAN TAKE FROM ME.

33:13.491 --> 33:14.575
{\an8}DEFINITELY SOMETHING

33:14.659 --> 33:16.244
{\an8}THAT I'LL CHERISH
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

33:16.327 --> 33:18.329
{\an8}- I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT, UH,

33:18.413 --> 33:19.831
{\an8}I WANT THIS THING FOREVER,
THIS RIGHT HERE.

33:19.914 --> 33:22.083
{\an8}- YEAH.
- THIS RIGHT HERE.

33:22.166 --> 33:23.751
{\an8}- WE--WE DID IT TOGETHER.

33:23.835 --> 33:27.088
{\an8}- ON THE COUNT OF TEN,
RUN IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.965
{\an8}[laughter]

33:29.048 --> 33:31.718
{\an8}- I'M RUNNING TO THE BOARDWALK.

33:31.801 --> 33:34.345
{\an8}- THIS WAS A GOOD LAST NIGHT.
- YEAH, IT WAS.

33:34.429 --> 33:36.139
{\an8}- FOR EVERYBODY.
- IT WAS.

33:36.222 --> 33:37.682
{\an8}- THIS IS IT.

33:37.765 --> 33:40.226
{\an8}- IT TAKES A SPECIAL TYPE OF
PERSON TO GET THROUGH THIS,

33:40.309 --> 33:42.895
{\an8}AND WE ALL SHOULD BE
PROUD THAT WE BALLED OUT

33:42.979 --> 33:44.021
{\an8}AND--AND--AND HAD
AN AWESOME TIME.

33:44.105 --> 33:46.065
{\an8}NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED
THIS SUMMER,

33:46.149 --> 33:48.735
{\an8}AT THE END OF THE DAY,
THAT'S OUR FAM.

33:48.818 --> 33:49.652
{\an8}WE LIVED TOGETHER,
WE SLEEP TOGETHER,

33:49.736 --> 33:52.321
{\an8}UH, WE FIGHT TOGETHER,

33:52.405 --> 33:54.115
{\an8}BUT WE'RE ALSO MAKING UP
TOGETHER.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.242
{\an8}I'M ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE
TEARY-EYED RIGHT NOW.

33:56.325 --> 33:58.745
{\an8}I'M DEFINITELY
GONNA MISS EVERYBODY.

33:58.828 --> 33:59.912
{\an8}- THIS WAS A LIFE-CHANGING
EXPERIENCE

33:59.996 --> 34:01.247
{\an8}WHETHER YOU LIKE IT
OR NOT.

34:01.330 --> 34:04.208
{\an8}- MAYBE WE SHOULD GET A SHORE
HOUSE NEXT--NEXT SUMMER.

34:04.292 --> 34:04.667
{\an8}ALL OF US!

34:04.751 --> 34:07.253
{\an8}[cheering]

34:07.336 --> 34:08.212
{\an8}- LET'S DO IT!
- SEE YOU NEXT SUMMER!

34:08.295 --> 34:09.839
{\an8}- LET'S DO IT!
LET'S DO IT!

34:09.922 --> 34:12.175
{\an8}- HAMPTONS, THOUGH.
HAMPTONS!

34:12.257 --> 34:14.302
{\an8}- SEE YOU NEXT SUMMER.

34:26.563 --> 34:29.192
{\an8}- OH, SAM, I AM, SAM, I AM.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.985
{\an8}- PAULY.

34:31.068 --> 34:33.279
{\an8}TOO MUCH STUFF TO PACK.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.406
{\an8}- YEAH.

34:35.489 --> 34:36.114
{\an8}NOW IT'S TIME TO PACK UP.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.951
{\an8}EVERYBODY'S REAL QUIET.

34:39.034 --> 34:40.786
{\an8}LIKE, REAL SAD--
LOOKING AT EACH OTHER

34:40.870 --> 34:42.580
{\an8}LIKE, DAMN, THIS IS
REALLY THE LAST TIME.

34:42.663 --> 34:44.665
{\an8}SUMMER IS OVER,
AND WE'RE LEAVING JERSEY.

34:44.748 --> 34:47.085
{\an8}- OH, BOY.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.880
{\an8}- YOU KNOW, I RAN THE HOUSE
FROM START TO FINISH,

34:51.964 --> 34:53.341
{\an8}WHETHER
PEOPLE LIKED IT OR NOT.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.384
{\an8}I HAD SUCH A WILD TIME
THIS SUMMER.

34:55.467 --> 34:56.761
{\an8}I DID WHATEVER I WANTED.

34:56.844 --> 35:00.431
{\an8}I TOOK WHATEVER I WANTED,
AND IT WAS MY WORLD.

35:00.515 --> 35:01.516
{\an8}IT'S DONE.

35:01.599 --> 35:02.517
{\an8}PEACE.

35:02.600 --> 35:06.479
{\an8}PEACE.

35:10.107 --> 35:10.858
{\an8}THAT'S IT, EVERYBODY.
PEACE.

35:10.942 --> 35:14.570
{\an8}- BYE, ROOMMATE.
- I'LL MISS YOU.

35:14.654 --> 35:17.031
{\an8}- I ACTUALLY DO LOVE YOU.
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

35:17.114 --> 35:18.574
{\an8}- SEE YOU AROUND.
- ALL RIGHT, BROTHER.

35:18.658 --> 35:20.701
{\an8}PEACE.

35:20.785 --> 35:23.454
{\an8}[bleep], MY MAN.
HERE'S MY MAN RIGHT HERE.

35:23.538 --> 35:24.664
{\an8}[overlapping chatter]

35:24.747 --> 35:25.748
{\an8}- I'LL MISS YOU, BROTHER.
- LOVE YOU, KID.

35:25.832 --> 35:28.125
{\an8}IT IS, UH, DEFINITELY
A LITTLE SAD TO MOVE OUT

35:28.209 --> 35:29.794
{\an8}AND SAY GOOD-BYE
TO EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW,

35:29.877 --> 35:31.212
{\an8}'CAUSE WE HAVE A LOT
OF MEMORIES IN THAT HOUSE

35:31.295 --> 35:34.465
{\an8}AND A LOT OF BONDS
THAT EVERYBODY FORMED HERE.

35:34.549 --> 35:36.884
{\an8}IT'S ALMOST LIKE SAYING GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR FAMILY.

35:36.968 --> 35:40.513
{\an8}IT IS "UNDESCRIBABLE,"
THE TIME THAT I HAD HERE.

35:40.596 --> 35:42.890
{\an8}I HAD A BALL, OKAY?
YOU KNOW, I RAN THIS HOUSE.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.725
{\an8}IT SHOULD BE CALLED
SITCH'S HOUSE.

35:44.809 --> 35:45.852
{\an8}I WAS THE KING OF THE CASTLE
RIGHT THERE.

35:45.935 --> 35:47.895
{\an8}THAT'S HOW IT GETS DONE.

35:47.979 --> 35:51.524
{\an8}THAT'S HOW IT GETS DONE.

35:51.607 --> 35:53.359
{\an8}- MY MAN.

35:53.442 --> 35:55.236
{\an8}YOU'RE MY BOY.
- I LOVE YOU, MAN.

35:55.319 --> 35:57.572
{\an8}- I'M JUST LIKE, ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS IT.

35:57.655 --> 36:01.075
{\an8}LIKE, YOU KNOW, LIKE, I HAD
A SUMMER WITH SEVEN STRANGERS,

36:01.158 --> 36:02.577
{\an8}AND THEY ALL
BECAME MY FRIENDS,

36:02.660 --> 36:04.453
{\an8}LIKE, YOU KNOW,
SO THAT'S PRETTY COOL.

36:04.537 --> 36:06.581
{\an8}- HOLY [bleep].

36:10.626 --> 36:13.546
{\an8}- DEFINITELY GONNA MAKE OUT
RIGHT NOW.

36:13.629 --> 36:16.716
{\an8}I KNOW THAT FOR A FACT.

36:18.342 --> 36:20.595
{\an8}- HELLO.
FROM THE BEGINNING,

36:20.678 --> 36:21.762
{\an8}I WASN'T
REALLY LOOKING FOR ANYTHING

36:21.846 --> 36:24.015
{\an8}COMING INTO THIS HOUSE.

36:24.098 --> 36:25.474
{\an8}YOU KNOW, I WAS LIKE, I'M
JUST HERE TO HAVE A GOOD TIME

36:25.558 --> 36:26.934
{\an8}AND SEE WHERE THINGS GO.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.436
{\an8}AND APPARENTLY,
RON WAS THE SAME WAY.

36:28.519 --> 36:31.063
{\an8}- MY ONLY RULE--NEVER FALL IN
LOVE AT THE JERSEY SHORE.

36:31.147 --> 36:32.899
{\an8}I DON'T [bleep] WHERE I SLEEP.

36:32.982 --> 36:35.776
{\an8}RULE NUMBER TWO, MY MAN--

36:35.860 --> 36:37.945
{\an8}I NEVER THOUGHT I'D COME DOWN
HERE TO PICK UP A GIRLFRIEND.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.322
{\an8}I BROKE MY RULES, YOU KNOW?

36:39.405 --> 36:40.531
{\an8}SAMMI DEFINITELY
FLIPPED THE SCRIPT ON ME,

36:40.615 --> 36:43.451
{\an8}AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM
BREAKING MY RULES FOR HER,

36:43.534 --> 36:44.785
{\an8}BECAUSE I'M HAPPY.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.829
{\an8}I MEAN, I HAVEN'T FELT THIS WAY
IN A LONG TIME.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.414
{\an8}- EVEN THOUGH I HOOKED UP
WITH MIKE, I GUESS,

36:48.497 --> 36:50.041
{\an8}BEFORE I HOOKED UP
WITH RONNIE...

36:50.124 --> 36:51.542
{\an8}BUT, UM, WHEN I KISSED MIKE I
DIDN'T, LIKE, FEEL ANYTHING,

36:51.626 --> 36:54.503
{\an8}AND WHEN I KISSED RONNIE, LIKE,
THAT'S HOW YOU, LIKE, KNOW

36:54.587 --> 36:56.881
{\an8}WHEN YOU LIKE SOMEBODY--LIKE,
YOU FEEL SOMETHING, KIND OF.

36:56.964 --> 37:00.176
{\an8}I NEVER, EVER EXPECTED TO LIKE,
REALLY LIKE SOMEBODY

37:00.259 --> 37:00.801
{\an8}AS MUCH AS I LIKE RONNIE.

37:00.885 --> 37:04.138
{\an8}- YEAH, BUT I WANT MORE.

37:04.221 --> 37:05.973
{\an8}IT'S REAL.
IT IS, DEFINITELY.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.017
{\an8}[laughing]

37:10.728 --> 37:11.938
{\an8}- I CAME HERE, LIKE, NO WAY,

37:12.021 --> 37:15.149
{\an8}I'M NOT LOOKING FOR
A RELATIONSHIP AND NOW, LIKE,

37:15.232 --> 37:17.109
{\an8}ME AND RON ARE LIKE
BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND.

37:17.193 --> 37:18.903
{\an8}- ANOTHER WINNER OVER HERE.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.196
{\an8}MUSCLES MADANAD...

37:20.279 --> 37:22.657
{\an8}- IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND
SOMEBODY YOU CARE ABOUT

37:22.740 --> 37:25.117
{\an8}AT THE JERSEY SHORE AND BUILD
A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM.

37:25.201 --> 37:27.244
{\an8}LIKE, I FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW,
I WANNA STAY WITH HER.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.956
{\an8}YOU KNOW, AND JUST CONTINUE
TO BE AS HAPPY AS WE ARE.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.015
{\an8}- BYE, LOVER.
- BYE, BOOGER.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.184
{\an8}- I LOVE YOU.
- I LOVE YOU MORE.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.978
{\an8}BYE, LITTLE BROTHER.
- BYE.

37:52.061 --> 37:54.438
{\an8}NICE TO MEET YOU.
- YOU TOO.

37:54.522 --> 37:57.400
{\an8}- [laughs] NICE TO MEET YOU.
- BYE, MAKE-OUT FRIEND.

37:57.483 --> 37:58.693
{\an8}- AW.

37:58.776 --> 37:59.485
{\an8}REALLY KEEP IN TOUCH,
FOR REAL.

37:59.568 --> 38:01.821
{\an8}- LOVE YOU.
- LOVE YOU MORE.

38:01.904 --> 38:02.863
{\an8}NOTHING IN THIS WORLD
COULD TAKE AWAY

38:02.947 --> 38:05.700
{\an8}WHAT I DID IN THIS HOUSE.

38:05.783 --> 38:08.661
{\an8}20, 30 YEARS FROM NOW,
I'LL REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

38:08.744 --> 38:10.705
{\an8}I'M REALLY GLAD I DID IT.

38:10.788 --> 38:13.749
{\an8}- AW, MAN.
- BYE, PAULY.

38:13.833 --> 38:16.836
{\an8}- DON'T WANNA GO YET.
[overlapping chatter]

38:16.919 --> 38:19.630
{\an8}- MY MAN.
- I'M GONNA MISS YOU, MY DUDE.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.507
{\an8}- I HAD, LIKE,
THE BEST SUMMER OF MY LIFE.

38:21.590 --> 38:23.426
{\an8}GIRLS ON THE RIDES,
GIRLS ON THE BEACH,

38:23.509 --> 38:24.343
{\an8}GIRLS IN THE HOUSE, HOT TUB.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.762
{\an8}GIRLS AFTER GIRLS
AFTER GIRLS.

38:26.846 --> 38:27.596
{\an8}THAT'S AN IDEAL SUMMER
FOR ANYBODY.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.306
{\an8}[honking]

38:29.390 --> 38:32.893
{\an8}IT REALLY WAS
THE SUMMER OF MY LIFE.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.312
{\an8}- LOVE YOU.

38:35.396 --> 38:37.231
{\an8}- YOU REALLY GREW ON ME.
- REALLY?

38:37.315 --> 38:38.941
{\an8}- YEAH. WE'LL KEEP IN TOUCH.
- ALL RIGHT.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.484
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, BYE, BABY.
- BYE.

38:40.568 --> 38:43.571
{\an8}- THIS WAS MY FIRST
JERSEY SHORE SUMMER.

38:43.654 --> 38:47.074
{\an8}I DID SOMETHING THAT YOUR
AVERAGE 21-YEAR-OLD KID

38:47.158 --> 38:48.492
{\an8}JUST DOESN'T DO.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.953
{\an8}AND IT'S AN EXPERIENCE
THAT I CAN TALK ABOUT

38:51.037 --> 38:52.705
{\an8}THE REST OF MY LIFE.

38:54.331 --> 38:55.916
{\an8}- LIKE...

38:56.000 --> 38:57.918
{\an8}IT WAS JUST HARD TO SAY
GOOD-BYE TO EVERYBODY.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.211
{\an8}LIKE, IT REALLY HIT ME, LIKE,
THIS IS OVER.

38:59.295 --> 39:02.298
{\an8}LIKE OUR SHORE HOUSE IS GONE.

39:02.381 --> 39:05.426
{\an8}LIKE, ME BEING HERE DEFINITELY,
LIKE, MADE ME GROW.

39:05.509 --> 39:07.678
{\an8}GOOD-BYE, EVERYONE.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.513
{\an8}BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE A LOT OF BEST MEMORIES.

39:09.597 --> 39:14.185
{\an8}UM, I REALLY THINK
I MADE THAT HOUSE, HONESTLY.

39:14.268 --> 39:15.978
{\an8}HELLO, PARTY'S HERE.

39:16.062 --> 39:18.314
{\an8}- THE PARTY'S HERE?

39:18.397 --> 39:20.691
{\an8}- YOU GUYS DRINKIN' OR WHAT?
- HERE WE GO--IT'S RIGHT HERE.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.443
{\an8}- WHOO!

39:22.526 --> 39:23.611
{\an8}WHEN I CAME HERE--
NO IDEA WHAT I WAS DOING.

39:23.694 --> 39:27.198
{\an8}UM, THE FIRST WEEK,
IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR ME,

39:27.281 --> 39:29.742
{\an8}BECAUSE I
JUST SCREWED THE [bleep] UP.

39:29.825 --> 39:30.951
{\an8}NO ONE REALLY WANTED
TO GET TO KNOW ME,

39:31.035 --> 39:33.788
{\an8}AND IT WAS HARD TO GET
OVER THAT FIRST IMPRESSION

39:33.871 --> 39:34.413
{\an8}THAT I GAVE EVERYBODY.

39:34.497 --> 39:35.373
{\an8}BUT I TRIED REALLY HARD.

39:35.456 --> 39:37.208
{\an8}I WANNA APOLOGIZE
TO ALL OF YOU

39:37.291 --> 39:40.377
{\an8}IF I ACTED LIKE
A [bleep] LAST NIGHT...

39:40.461 --> 39:42.046
{\an8}IF I OFFENDED YOU,

39:42.129 --> 39:43.881
{\an8}OR IF YOU GOT
THE WRONG IMPRESSION OF ME.

39:43.964 --> 39:47.635
{\an8}AND A COUPLE WEEKS AFTER THAT,
I JUST--I WAS BEING MYSELF.

39:47.718 --> 39:50.638
{\an8}I LOVED IT, LIKE, I JUST HAD
A GOOD TIME WITH EVERYBODY.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.473
{\an8}I WAS FEELING LIKE AN OUTCAST,

39:52.556 --> 39:55.142
{\an8}BUT NOW I FEEL LIKE
I'M A PART OF THE FAMILY NOW.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.185
{\an8}THEY'RE STARTING
TO GET TO KNOW ME.

39:56.268 --> 39:58.562
{\an8}- LOOK, HE'S ALIVE.
- [screaming]

39:58.646 --> 40:00.189
{\an8}I DID GROW UP--I GREW UP A LOT.

40:00.272 --> 40:03.150
{\an8}AND I SURVIVED HERE,
AND I DID IT ON MY OWN.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.110
{\an8}CHEERS, EVERYONE.

40:04.193 --> 40:07.238
{\an8}I THINK I'VE COME A LONG WAY.

40:07.321 --> 40:09.490
{\an8}I'M [bleep] MATURE,
AND I'M A BETTER PERSON,

40:09.573 --> 40:11.158
{\an8}AND IT REALLY
CHANGED ME HERE.

40:11.242 --> 40:15.246
{\an8}THE JERSEY SHORE CHANGED ME.
WHAT DO YA KNOW?

40:15.329 --> 40:15.704
{\an8}REALLY?

40:15.788 --> 40:18.999
{\an8}OH, JEEZ.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.210
{\an8}OH, MY [bleep] GOD.

40:21.293 --> 40:23.212
{\an8}[laughing]

40:24.713 --> 40:26.048
{\an8}PEACE, SHORE HOUSE.

40:26.132 --> 40:28.843
{\an8}THE SNOOKS IS OUT.
