I've spent my entire life

02:11.590 --> 02:14.218

that I have been
measuring my penis incorrectly

02:17.221 --> 02:19.681

once a year on Boxing Day.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.566
‐ Well, how come it's on Boxing Day?

02:29.566 --> 02:31.985

Mrs. McMurray's family leaves

02:53.674 --> 02:58.011
I pull the tape out and... 4.15 inches.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.430
‐ <i>So, you're essentially</i>
<i>fuckin' with a three‐quarter Rolo.</i>

03:07.437 --> 03:09.147
‐ How did you manage to fluff that up?

03:09.147 --> 03:11.900
‐ As Mrs. McMurray goes
and gets her Christmas lingerie on,

03:11.900 --> 03:14.486
I lie myself in bed and I get myself
good and hard.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.530
Not a little hard. Good and hard.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.031
‐ So, fully torqued, then?

03:18.031 --> 03:19.908
‐ Full bars.
‐ <i>Full Snickers bars.</i>

03:19.908 --> 03:21.201
‐ Holy fuck.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.453
‐ I prop lil' Mac down like so,

03:23.453 --> 03:25.372
and I lay the tape
along top of him like so,

03:25.372 --> 03:26.582
so he's pointing outwards.

03:26.582 --> 03:29.543
‐ So, uh, ninety degrees, out like that?

03:29.543 --> 03:30.961
‐ Exactly, Dary.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.129
And then I take the tape

03:32.129 --> 03:34.882
and I press it firmly
against my pubic bone,

03:34.882 --> 03:36.675
and then I lay her down
on top of lil' Mac.

03:36.675 --> 03:40.179
‐ And?
‐ And 4.15 inches.

03:40.179 --> 03:42.389
‐ <i>That's some balls,</i>
<i>advertising that there, bud.</i>

03:43.015 --> 03:44.975

03:44.975 --> 03:47.728
‐ What the actual fuck are you
talking about, McMurray?

03:47.728 --> 03:51.064
‐ I learnt on Stern today
that you are not "exposed" to measure

03:51.064 --> 03:54.109
from your pubic bone to the tip
of your penis on the top side.

03:54.109 --> 03:57.404
You are, in fact, "exposed"
to measure from your balls

03:57.404 --> 03:59.573
to the tip of your penis
on the underside.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.992
‐ Are you sure?
‐ Well, you don't argue with Stern.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.870
‐ This, the correct mode of measurement,

04:04.870 --> 04:06.747
gives me one additional inch

04:06.747 --> 04:09.208
and, by clinical definition,

04:09.208 --> 04:12.920
a 100% average‐sized penis

04:12.920 --> 04:18.091
at 5.15 inches!

04:18.091 --> 04:22.095
‐ <i>I don't think I've ever seen anyone</i>
<i>be so excited to be average.</i>

04:22.095 --> 04:24.181
‐ I don't think that method
of measurement is accurate.

04:24.181 --> 04:25.349
WAYNE:
Well, if Stern said it...

04:25.349 --> 04:26.808
‐ He didn't say Stern says it.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.101
He says he heards it on Sterns.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.354

08:56.411 --> 08:57.996
[yells, then laughs]

08:57.996 --> 08:59.289
[clattering]

08:59.289 --> 09:00.791
You got one.
‐ Fuckin' A.

09:00.791 --> 09:01.458
‐ For what?

09:04.503 --> 09:07.130
‐ We're resurrecting
the Letterkenny Irish.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.053
[music stops]

09:13.053 --> 09:13.846
What?

09:15.013 --> 09:16.765
‐ That team is dog shit.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.144
We're resurrecting the Letterkenny Irish.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.897
I need my star players.

09:24.690 --> 09:27.526
Are you in?
BOTH: Yes!

09:27.526 --> 09:28.819
‐ All right.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.321
The Letterkenny Irish are back.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.115
‐ Not yet. We're gonna need some finesse.

09:33.115 --> 09:34.825
‐ We'll find you holes.
‐ We'll get you deep.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.369
‐ We know a thing or two about bulging.

09:37.369 --> 09:38.453
Twine.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.247
‐ Daxi. Ronzy.
‐ Tanzy.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.415
‐ Never again.
‐ Got you.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.375
‐ All right, boys, you're in.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.586
Now we just need some sandpaper.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.839
[grunting]

09:48.839 --> 09:50.841
Tyson, Joint Boy, you got a sec?

09:50.841 --> 09:52.301
BOTH:
No.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.220
COACH:
Will these guys do?

09:55.220 --> 09:56.930
‐ These guys... I will do.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.266
‐ Okay.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.934
‐ So, the Letterkenny Irish are back.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.019
‐ Not yet.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.478
We got most of the pieces in place.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.981
But we only got one shot at this.

10:05.981 --> 10:08.442
One chance. One win. You know?

10:08.442 --> 10:11.987
Vomit on your mom's spaghetti,
or whatever that talking singer says.

10:11.987 --> 10:14.823
None of these guys
have won a championship.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.617
We gotta find some people
that know how to win.

10:17.326 --> 10:19.703
‐ Where do we find them?
‐ At the gym.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.956
‐ But we were just there!

10:22.956 --> 10:25.459
‐ They weren't there when we were there!

10:26.126 --> 10:27.211
‐ We were here the whole time.

10:27.211 --> 10:28.212
‐ Really?

10:28.212 --> 10:30.589
‐ And we're inski.
‐ Soda Popinski.

10:30.589 --> 10:32.132
‐ Can't wait to get back
out there, Betty‐Anne.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.051
‐ Been far too long, Mary‐Anne.
‐ You won't be playing.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.052
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

10:35.052 --> 10:36.803
‐ Huh?
‐ You'll be coaching.

10:36.803 --> 10:37.846
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

10:37.846 --> 10:39.973
‐ Hold up. How come they can't they play?

10:42.392 --> 10:44.019
Just fuckin' around.

10:44.019 --> 10:46.355
‐ Same. Absolutely in
for telling men how to do shit.

10:46.355 --> 10:48.607
‐ Absolutely in for telling men
how to win shit.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.317
‐ Phew.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.361
I thought we were gonna have
one of those conversations,

10:52.361 --> 10:55.197
you know, where women
can do anything men can do.

10:55.197 --> 10:57.908
[laughs] So stupid.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.786
‐ That isn't a conversation.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.746
‐ Women can do anything men can do.

11:02.746 --> 11:03.705
‐ Women can do it better.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.207
‐ Eh... no.

11:05.207 --> 11:06.542
‐ No?
‐ No!

11:06.542 --> 11:08.043
‐ No?
‐ No.

11:08.043 --> 11:09.461
‐ No?
‐ No!

11:09.461 --> 11:10.420
‐ No?
‐ No.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.588
‐ No?
‐ No!

11:11.588 --> 11:13.173
‐ No?
‐ No.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.925
‐ So, you're saying
men are superior to women?

11:14.925 --> 11:15.801
‐ Yeah!
‐ Yeah?

11:15.801 --> 11:17.135
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah?

11:17.135 --> 11:18.428
‐ Yeah!
‐ Yeah?

11:18.428 --> 11:19.429
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah?

11:19.429 --> 11:20.514
‐ Yeah!
‐ Yeah?

11:20.514 --> 11:22.015
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah?

11:22.015 --> 11:23.809
‐ Yeah.
‐ Explain.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.270
‐ Come on...

11:26.270 --> 11:27.896
‐ No, you come on.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.398
‐ Come on.
‐ You come on.

11:29.398 --> 11:30.649
‐ Come on!
‐ You come on.

11:30.649 --> 11:31.942
‐ Guys, come on.

11:31.942 --> 11:33.402
ALL:
You come on!

11:33.402 --> 11:35.571
‐ They're 120 pounds, soaking wet,

11:35.571 --> 11:37.906
full stomachs,
pockets full of loonies and toonies.

11:37.906 --> 11:41.243
‐ So?
‐ So, senior hockey players, men,

11:41.243 --> 11:43.620
are up to 220 pounds. More.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.373
‐ So?
‐ That's 100 pounds more!

11:46.373 --> 11:48.834
‐ So?
‐ So they could get killed out there.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.211
You will get killed out there.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.005
You will die.
Think that's something to think about,

11:53.005 --> 11:54.381
I think, huh?

11:54.381 --> 11:56.008
Do you have good relationships
with your mom?

11:56.008 --> 11:56.884
‐ Yeah.
‐ No.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.760
‐ Well, better pick up a phone
and call her,

11:58.760 --> 11:59.845
'cause you're dead.

11:59.845 --> 12:01.471
'Cause you wanted to play a game

12:01.471 --> 12:04.683
with men who are bigger
and faster than you.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.351
‐ And faster?
‐ Yeah.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.394
‐ Yeah?
‐ Yeah.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.980
‐ Yeah?
‐ Yeah. Yeah!

12:10.939 --> 12:13.650
Look, I watch the Olympic games.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.527
All the events. All of 'em.

12:15.527 --> 12:19.615
Every single one. All right?

12:19.615 --> 12:22.201
And when the Olympic games are on,
all the events, every one,

12:22.201 --> 12:25.913
every single one,

12:25.913 --> 12:28.373
the men's speeds, results and times

12:28.373 --> 12:32.002
eclipse the women's speeds,
results and times

12:32.002 --> 12:33.420
every time.
‐ Play us.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.088
‐ In what?
‐ Hockey.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.798
‐ [scoffs]
Your team folded.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.175
‐ The girls are still around.

12:38.175 --> 12:39.384
‐ The girls would love this.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.512
‐ If you win, we'll coach with you.

12:41.512 --> 12:43.639
‐ You're playing them.
Get the boys gelling.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.641
I want to test drive an idea
I have for the Rez game.

12:45.641 --> 12:46.767
‐ Okay.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.727
‐ No contact.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.979
‐ [laughs] I know.

12:50.979 --> 12:52.606
‐ Don't want our guys
getting hurt out there.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.566
‐ Yeah, the guys.

12:54.566 --> 12:55.859
‐ All right, let's do this.

12:55.859 --> 12:56.777
‐ You're going down.

12:57.861 --> 13:00.030
‐ Oh, my God. I'm so scared.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.114
‐ Good.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.616
[laughs, then wheezes]

13:02.616 --> 13:05.994
‐ Your spines are gonna snap...

13:07.371 --> 13:10.749
[wheezes]
You're gonna have a feeding tube...

13:10.749 --> 13:12.292
[laughs, then wheezes]

13:15.587 --> 13:17.840
[groans mockingly]

13:19.508 --> 13:20.676
[laughs]

13:27.391 --> 13:30.102
BOTH:
Hello. Well...

13:30.769 --> 13:32.813
You go. No, you go.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.022
Okay, I'll go.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.316
‐ I'm back.
‐ That's what you are.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.609
‐ But I have to go back to...

13:37.609 --> 13:38.569
‐ Vancouver, right?

13:38.569 --> 13:39.695
‐ Yeah, for...

13:39.695 --> 13:40.863
‐ Pit bull rescue still?

13:40.863 --> 13:43.407
‐ Yeah.
‐ You're a good fuckin' gal, Rosie.

13:44.366 --> 13:45.325
‐ I need a favor.

13:46.910 --> 13:47.703
‐ Oh.

13:47.703 --> 13:49.121
[whimpers]

13:50.372 --> 13:53.959
‐ Come here, bud.
Oh, who's a good boy?

13:55.544 --> 13:57.796
‐ Who is this?

13:57.796 --> 13:59.131
‐ That's Zeke.

13:59.131 --> 14:01.884
‐ Is he a Pit?
‐ Pits are banned in the province. I know.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.553
‐ What should be banned
is idiots breeding them,

14:04.553 --> 14:06.471
and then selling them to other idiots.

14:06.471 --> 14:07.806
‐ You're a good fuckin' guy, Wayne.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.266
‐ How'd you get him in?

14:09.266 --> 14:13.020
‐ There isn't a vet in the province
who backs breed‐specific legislation.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.230
They'll put anything on
his papers you ask 'em to.

14:15.230 --> 14:16.690
‐ So, if anyone asks, he's a...

14:16.690 --> 14:18.483
‐ Teacup Yorkie.
‐ Oh, is that what he is?

14:18.483 --> 14:21.028
‐ [chuckles] Kidding. American bulldog.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.404
‐ That's what he is.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.948
‐ I need you to hold onto him
for a couple days.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.284
‐ Okay.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.620
‐ His sister has been
lethargic since he left,

14:29.620 --> 14:30.829
so I'm going back for her.

14:30.829 --> 14:32.080
‐ And then what?

14:32.623 --> 14:33.624
‐ Then I'm back.

14:35.751 --> 14:37.336
I'll call you in a couple days.

14:37.336 --> 14:39.755
‐ Okay.
‐ Thank you.

14:47.763 --> 14:48.805
‐ All right. Hold up.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.475
Especially youse two.

14:51.475 --> 14:54.520
Just stay like that for me. Mmm.
Okay.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.272
You guys are gonna need to get mic'd
before your sweaters go on.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.190
‐ Mic'd?

14:58.190 --> 14:59.858
[groans]

15:02.069 --> 15:03.487
[scraping on whiteboard]

15:06.823 --> 15:08.200
‐ Why?
‐ Just...

15:08.200 --> 15:10.118
You, don't talk, okay?
It's just better for me.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.328
‐ Huh?
‐ Same for you.

15:12.454 --> 15:13.872
‐ Tanis?
‐ Huh.

15:13.872 --> 15:16.375
‐ Um, may we speak?

15:16.375 --> 15:17.918
‐ Sure.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.378
BOTH:
Why do we need mics?

15:19.378 --> 15:21.380
‐ All right, so you know
those videos on YouTube

15:21.380 --> 15:23.215
of all the NHL players
when they're all mic'd out?

15:23.215 --> 15:24.466
‐ You mean Mic'd Up?

15:24.466 --> 15:25.551
‐ Yeah, whatever.

15:25.551 --> 15:27.761
So, my cousins fucking love those videos

15:27.761 --> 15:30.138
and they watch them over
and over and over again.

15:30.138 --> 15:35.519
So, I want to provide for them
a pro‐level in‐game experience.

15:35.519 --> 15:40.315
So, for this afternoon's dress rehearsal,
youse are all gonna be mic'd out.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.401
‐ Mic'd up.
‐ Fuck you.

15:42.401 --> 15:43.610
‐ [feedback on radio]
‐ All right, Skids.

15:43.610 --> 15:44.820
‐ Natives.

15:44.820 --> 15:46.780
TANIS:
<i>Phasers set to stun up there, or what?</i>

15:46.780 --> 15:48.365
‐ Uh, Stewart hasn't
picked a song yet, but he‐‐

15:48.365 --> 15:49.658
‐ Roald.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.952
‐ Phasers set to stun, Tanzy!

15:51.952 --> 15:53.370
TANIS:
<i>"Tanzy." If this becomes a thing,</i>

15:53.370 --> 15:55.372
<i>I swear to Christ, I will‐‐</i>
‐ Walk‐up music.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.749
A critical factor in
creating a team's identity.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.710
The Vancouver Canucks have
<i>Where The Streets Have No Name.</i>

15:59.710 --> 16:00.419
‐ U2.

16:00.419 --> 16:02.045
‐ Anaheim Ducks have <i>Bro Hymn.</i>
‐ Pennywise.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.630
‐ Buffalo Sabres have
<i>Let Me Clear My Throat.</i>

16:03.630 --> 16:04.631
‐ DJ Kool.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.091
‐ And the Letterkenny Irish have...

16:06.091 --> 16:08.093
‐ Hmm... A floor burner?
‐ Hmm...

16:08.093 --> 16:09.052
A heart‐string tugger?

16:09.052 --> 16:11.305
‐ Might I suggest...
‐ [hissing]

16:11.805 --> 16:12.848
A Boogie?

16:15.184 --> 16:16.435
[sighs]

16:16.435 --> 16:18.520
‐ Youse ready?
‐ We're missing a few guys, boys.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.730
‐ Who?

16:19.730 --> 16:23.150
‐ Barts, Yorkie, Scholtzy,
Fisky, Boomtown.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.569
‐ We're not missing anyone.
All right, fuck those guys.

16:25.569 --> 16:27.154
I don't want to talk
about them right now.

16:27.154 --> 16:30.657
I got a player who plays bigger
than all of them combined, so...

16:30.657 --> 16:31.575
‐ No.
‐ Not...

16:31.575 --> 16:34.411
‐ Oh, yes.
BOTH: No!

16:34.411 --> 16:35.913
‐ [Shoresy farts]
SHORESY: Will you two just

16:35.913 --> 16:37.206
man up and make out?

16:37.206 --> 16:40.375
I started an office pool for it
and the day I picked is tomorrow.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.293
Get tuggin', tit fuckers.

16:41.293 --> 16:43.128
‐ [Shoresy farts]
‐ Fuck you, Shoresy.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.087
SHORESY:
Fuck you, Jonesy.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.715
Your mom pulled the goalie on me
and now she's preggo.

16:46.715 --> 16:49.009
Surprise, son.
Go rake the fuckin' yard. [farts]

16:49.009 --> 16:51.303
‐ Fuck you, Shoresy.
SHORESY: Fuck you, Reilly.

16:51.303 --> 16:52.930
I slipped one past your mom, too.

16:52.930 --> 16:55.474
Her preggo farts
smell like hot dog water.

16:55.474 --> 16:57.142
‐ [Shoresy farts]
‐ Fuck you, Shoresy.

16:57.142 --> 16:58.519
SHORESY: Fuck you, Jonesy.

16:58.519 --> 17:01.855
Your mom's in her first trimester,
and already bitching about baby brain.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.774
Had to tell her she's been
dumber than Reilly's mom

17:03.774 --> 17:04.733
since the genesis.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.652
‐ [Shoresy farts]
‐ Fuck you, Shoresy.

17:06.652 --> 17:07.611
SHORESY:
Fuck you, Reilly.

17:07.611 --> 17:10.239
I talked your mom into
a three‐way with our midwife

17:10.239 --> 17:11.698
and she gassed us both out of the room.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.116
