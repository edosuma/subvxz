00:36.137 --> 00:37.169
Hi, fellas.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.505
Man, you are not
gonna believe this.

00:39.507 --> 00:43.308
Believe what?!
You see that big hole
over there on that wall?

00:43.310 --> 00:47.813
Yeah.
There's a bunny rabbit on the
other side of that hole.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.314
Really?!
Yeah.

00:49.316 --> 00:50.516
Look at it.

00:50.518 --> 00:51.450
Cool!

00:51.452 --> 00:54.787
(grunting)

00:54.789 --> 00:56.522
(all laughing)

00:56.524 --> 00:57.923
Draw a face on his ass!

00:57.925 --> 01:01.160
I'm going to draw
a face on his ass!

01:01.162 --> 01:04.029
CLEVELAND JR.: I think there's
been a misunderstanding!

01:04.031 --> 01:05.164
I don't see a rabbit.

01:05.166 --> 01:08.000
Pull his pants down,
then he'll have a furrowed brow.

01:08.002 --> 01:09.968
(all laughing)

01:09.970 --> 01:11.470
(chattering)

01:11.472 --> 01:14.540
OLIVER: Hey, Roberta, your
brother has horrible breath!

01:14.542 --> 01:16.208
(laughter)

01:16.210 --> 01:19.678
(sighs)
Junior, for the last time,

01:19.680 --> 01:21.780
there are no rabbits
at this school!

01:21.782 --> 01:23.015
Oh, bother.

01:23.017 --> 01:26.952
"Oh, uncool brother"
is more like it.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.954
(exaggerated laugh)

01:28.956 --> 01:33.092
Look, Junior, your nerd stank
is starting to rub off on me.

01:33.094 --> 01:36.195
Yeah, this isn't exactly
a high point for me either.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.964
We need to reinvent you,
the way I reinvented myself

01:38.966 --> 01:40.933
the summer after seventh grade.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.968
ROBERTA: <i>That summer,</i>
<i>I realized I needed</i>

01:42.970 --> 01:45.037
<i>something that set me apart.</i>

01:45.039 --> 01:47.339
<i>And when I returned</i>
<i>to school for eighth grade,</i>

01:47.341 --> 01:49.007
you should've seen the results.

01:49.009 --> 01:52.177
(boys hooting and whooping)

01:52.179 --> 01:53.946
<i>The cap was a hit.</i>

01:53.948 --> 01:55.180
(grunts)

01:55.182 --> 01:57.116
You need a new look.

01:57.118 --> 01:59.952
Come on, we're going
to the Fluvanna Mall.

01:59.954 --> 02:02.521
Count to five before
you follow me.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.990
Yeah, I know the drill.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.358
Bitch.

02:12.499 --> 02:14.633
(ding)
It's ready!

02:14.635 --> 02:17.970
Ladies and gentlemen,
as the self-appointed

02:17.972 --> 02:21.840
and beloved editor of Slop
Poppers' <i>Wikipedia</i> page...

02:21.842 --> 02:22.774
He's the king!

02:22.776 --> 02:24.143
He's tasted them all!

02:24.145 --> 02:25.944
Those things are
cancer in a box.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.513
I must record
the specimen's particulars

02:27.515 --> 02:30.182
for my next update.

02:30.184 --> 02:33.118
All right...
Chipotle Clam!

02:33.120 --> 02:35.087
(sniffing)

02:35.089 --> 02:37.156
Mmm...
Nice bouquet.

02:37.158 --> 02:41.960
Hints of leather.
Very clam forward.

02:41.962 --> 02:44.096
The chipotle peppers
were picked near

02:44.098 --> 02:47.032
Bakersfield, California,
and never washed.

02:49.536 --> 02:51.203
(sniffs and gags)

02:51.205 --> 02:55.207
It's not on the label,
but there's a bird in here.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.909
ALL: The king!
(applauds)

02:58.478 --> 03:01.980
Junior, you've been in there
for 45 minutes.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.016
Whoops, I fell asleep.

03:06.286 --> 03:07.586
Good morning.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.988
Damn, you look good.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.658
Hold on.
There you go, Junior.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.026
Uh-uh!

03:14.028 --> 03:16.028
Junior died lookig
for a wall rabbi.

03:16.030 --> 03:19.097
From now on,
I'm CJ McCool.

03:19.099 --> 03:21.099
No, wait, just CJ.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.268
I'm so cool,
I'll be known by one nam,

03:23.270 --> 03:25.938
like Madonna and Hitler.

03:25.940 --> 03:28.674
Ugh, Madonna's the worst.

03:32.812 --> 03:34.646
(video game beeps)
(grunting)

03:34.648 --> 03:36.281
Wow, a girl.

03:36.283 --> 03:38.917
And she likes
classic video games.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.852
Go try your CJ on her.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.956
She doesn't go to our school,
so she won't recognize you.

03:43.958 --> 03:45.991
Make it happen, CJ.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.427
I'm gonna go get a
five-minute public massage

03:48.429 --> 03:51.597
from an old Asian man.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.965
(game over music)

03:52.967 --> 03:56.635
(grunts)
Kiss my ass, fried egg!

03:56.637 --> 03:57.903
May I...?

03:59.005 --> 04:02.040
(rhythmic beeping)

04:02.042 --> 04:03.709
(triumphant music)

04:03.711 --> 04:05.944
That's Burger...
uh, Buntime!

04:05.946 --> 04:07.813
Nice. I'm Daisy.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.881
CJ. I like your hair.

04:09.883 --> 04:12.951
It's all "I don't care,"
but I know you do.

04:12.953 --> 04:17.022
Well, we've already had dinner.
You want to go dancing?

04:17.024 --> 04:19.024
Or we could go for a drive.

04:19.026 --> 04:22.060
Or I could rip your spine out
with a finishing move.

04:23.696 --> 04:26.965
You're funny. Well, if you
ever feel like hanging out,

04:26.967 --> 04:28.300
here's my number.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.269
You've got really
soft hands.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.604
I sleep with socks
filled with lotion on them.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.507
That's so weird.
Call me.

04:38.211 --> 04:41.413
Use your thumbs,
Dong! Dang!

04:43.883 --> 04:45.651
There we go!

04:45.653 --> 04:47.019
Come on, bitch!

04:47.021 --> 04:48.153
That's it, baby.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.921
Ain't nothing to it
but to do it.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.657
That mouthy cashier
at the Rite-Aid

04:51.659 --> 04:53.158
asked when my baby's due.

04:53.160 --> 04:57.029
These babies are due any day.

04:57.031 --> 04:59.031
Hm.
(bones cracking)

04:59.033 --> 05:01.199
All right, logging in
to <i>Wikipedia</i> as

05:01.201 --> 05:05.937
Popperkingcleve42.
Now, Chipotle Clam.

05:05.939 --> 05:09.141
52 grams of saturated fat.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.843
Mmm, this is making me hungry.

05:15.181 --> 05:16.848
Ah, here we go.

05:16.850 --> 05:20.118
Late-Night
Spicy Beefloaf Popper.

05:22.121 --> 05:27.492
(grunting)

05:27.494 --> 05:29.094
Rallo, what are you doing up?

05:29.096 --> 05:31.363
The back of the microwave
is in my room.

05:31.365 --> 05:33.165
The fan blows right
on my face.

05:33.167 --> 05:37.169
Well, since you're up,
hop on my back.

05:37.171 --> 05:41.039
(grunting)
One, two, two, two.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.141
You're not going
all the way down.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.376
There it is.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.945
Three... four...
(microwave timer dings)

05:46.947 --> 05:49.648
Wha...? Someone changed
the saturated fat count

05:49.650 --> 05:51.116
from 52 to 48!

05:51.118 --> 05:52.851
The sat-fat's been hacked!

05:54.620 --> 05:56.321
CLEVELAND: True Popper King?

05:56.323 --> 05:57.656
Oh, hell no!

05:57.658 --> 06:00.025
Let's just change this
back to 52.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.970
All right,
True popper King, it's on.

06:11.972 --> 06:16.007
I will find you, wrap foil
around your Wikipenia,

06:16.009 --> 06:19.444
and cook it for two to two
and-a-half minutes,

06:19.446 --> 06:22.280
as microwaves may vary!

06:22.282 --> 06:23.615
DONNA:
You tell him, baby!

06:23.617 --> 06:25.684
(grunting)
Come on, focus!

06:25.686 --> 06:28.887
Blast those abs,
you beautiful monster.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.995
(whistles)
Sweet air, Daisy.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.163
Thanks.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.998
After we got
ice cream last night,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.067
I stopped and got you something.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.469
(gasps)

06:44.471 --> 06:46.638
And I had it
customized for you.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.707
Anderson Cooper
with cornrows?!

06:48.709 --> 06:51.143
Just like my recurring nightmare
I told you about!

06:51.145 --> 06:53.612
Oh, Daisy, I could kiss you.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.981
You could.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.516
Hey, freaks!

06:57.518 --> 06:59.084
Who's this, Daisy?

06:59.086 --> 07:00.919
Your prom date?

07:00.921 --> 07:02.287
(all laugh)

07:02.289 --> 07:04.623
Don't worry about them, CJ.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.092
Well, I'd like to know
what's so amusing

07:07.094 --> 07:09.828
about the idea of me going
to a prom with Daisy?

07:09.830 --> 07:12.130
Uh, because it's disgusting.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.199
Let's just go skate
someplace else.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.834
No. You know what?

07:15.836 --> 07:17.636
That's not how CJ rolls.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.105
Just so you know,
we don't need to be accepted

07:20.107 --> 07:22.641
by a pack of future plastic
surgery disasters

07:22.643 --> 07:24.876
who will get real estate
licenses at 46

07:24.878 --> 07:26.945
in a desperate attempt
to find a third husband

07:26.947 --> 07:29.181
who will take care of them
after their lips explode.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.984
Run.
(girls screaming)

07:32.986 --> 07:35.287
Wow.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.022
Were you serious when
you said you might

07:37.024 --> 07:38.690
actually go to prom with me?

07:38.692 --> 07:39.791
Of course!

07:39.793 --> 07:41.026
Oh, CJ.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.528
I can't wait to see
the look on everyone's

07:43.530 --> 07:45.864
faces when they see
I've brought a girl to the prom.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.199
Say what now?

07:47.201 --> 07:51.670
We'll be the first lesbian
couple at my school's prom ever.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.773
What?!
I'm gonna go find us some
matching Crocs to wear.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.710
How could she possibly think...

08:01.314 --> 08:03.381
Yeah, I see it.

08:08.087 --> 08:09.955
What?!
A lesbian?!

08:09.957 --> 08:11.523
How could she possibly think...

08:11.525 --> 08:13.825
Yeah, I see it.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.260
I probably should've
been tipped off,

08:15.262 --> 08:17.762
but we just had so many
interests in common:

08:17.764 --> 08:20.699
professional women's bowling,
rescue dogs,

08:20.701 --> 08:23.368
wearing shorts every day
no matter how cold it is...

08:23.370 --> 08:25.637
Junior, you have to
tell Daisy you're a guy.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.839
But if I tell her,
then I'll lose her!

08:27.841 --> 08:29.941
So what if I have to
live as a girl?

08:29.943 --> 08:32.477
Serena Williams did it,
and he won Wimbledon.

08:32.479 --> 08:34.946
I'm just saying,
a strong relationship

08:34.948 --> 08:37.549
has to be built
on honesty, trust,

08:37.551 --> 08:41.086
and knowing if the other person
has a wang. Dang!

08:41.088 --> 08:43.154
(murmuring grunts)

08:43.156 --> 08:46.591
Rallo, I need you to
lure TruePopperking33

08:46.593 --> 08:48.994
into a chat room and
entice him to come over

08:48.996 --> 08:51.029
with some wine coolers.
(door opens)

08:51.031 --> 08:52.998
Cleve-bro,
sorry to bust in.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.966
Too important.
Someone made a page for you.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.701
And it wasn't me!

08:58.804 --> 09:01.473
That's not me!
I've been photochopped!

09:01.475 --> 09:03.475
Hey, you got Angry Birds
on that thing?

09:03.477 --> 09:04.442
No, I don't.

09:04.444 --> 09:06.478
But I see it right there.
Can I play?

09:06.480 --> 09:08.813
Sorry, my mom said
no one else can play with it.

09:08.815 --> 09:09.814
'Nuff said, 'nuff said.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.516
Oh, and there's a video.

09:17.156 --> 09:18.189
(screams)

09:18.191 --> 09:20.191
Oh, thank God,
it's not real.

09:23.663 --> 09:25.096
(rings)

09:27.934 --> 09:32.337
(big sigh) Let me guess,
you're here for my sister.

09:32.339 --> 09:35.674
Daisy.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.275
Hi, CJ!

09:37.277 --> 09:39.311
I got us dinner
reservations
for prom night.

09:39.313 --> 09:41.680
And I looked
into an apartment
for the two of us.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.348
Oh, boy.
Um...

09:43.350 --> 09:44.783
Daisy...

09:44.785 --> 09:47.352
I have to tell you something.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.154
I can't go to
the prom with you.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.655
What? Why?

09:50.657 --> 09:53.258
I haven't been
honest about who I am.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.793
Oh, my God.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.094
You're not out yet.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.028
Beg pardon?

09:57.030 --> 10:01.166
(moans) Why is it so hot today?

10:01.168 --> 10:03.668
Look, I understand
how hard this is.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.137
It took me a long time
to come out, too.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.006
But trust me, it's worth it.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.774
(moans passionately)

10:09.776 --> 10:11.843
Whoa.

10:11.845 --> 10:14.980
What's the female version of
"boi-yoi-yoi-yoing"?

10:14.982 --> 10:20.018
DAISY'S BROTHER (whiny): Oh, the
Bagel Bites have freezer burn.

10:23.489 --> 10:25.957
Donna, you got that bread
in your purse, right?

10:25.959 --> 10:27.926
And the lemon slices
from the water.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.594
Good girl.

10:29.596 --> 10:31.663
Um, Mr. Brown?

10:31.665 --> 10:34.933
Can I speak to you under
the table for a moment?
Of course.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.768
I'm sorry, I didn't
want to embarrass you

10:36.770 --> 10:39.938
in front of your wife, but your
credit card has been declined.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.439
Declined!?

10:41.441 --> 10:42.974
You know, it's
a little cramped down here.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.209
Donna, switch?

10:44.211 --> 10:45.543
Okay.

10:45.545 --> 10:48.046
Ah, that's better.
Declined?!

10:48.048 --> 10:50.982
I'm going to go to the bank
and talk to Atm.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.518
(beeping)
Declined!?

10:53.520 --> 10:55.453
But Atm...
(car engine starts)

10:55.455 --> 10:59.024
Sorry, Mac. This here car
was reported stolen, bub.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.992
Them's the breaks, pally.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.328
(tires screech)
What?!
Why is this all happening?

11:03.330 --> 11:05.030
(phone chimes)

11:06.265 --> 11:08.533
(gasps)
True Popper King!

11:08.535 --> 11:11.236
He's everywhere!
(phone chimes)

11:24.517 --> 11:25.950
Whoa!

11:25.952 --> 11:28.453
Private moment, Mr.Carradine?

11:28.455 --> 11:31.456
No! I'm trying to prevent
Truepopperking33

11:31.458 --> 11:34.125
from infiltrating our house...

11:34.127 --> 11:35.927
and my mind!

11:35.929 --> 11:37.862
(groans) Enough!

11:37.864 --> 11:39.998
To put an end
to this nonsense, I called

11:40.000 --> 11:43.201
the Slop Popper company, and you
and that other fat-ass

11:43.203 --> 11:45.470
with too much free time, are
gonna settle this

11:45.472 --> 11:48.940
with a "Popper-Off" at
Slop Popper Headquarters.

11:48.942 --> 11:52.110
No... way!

11:52.112 --> 11:54.379
And True Popper King
said he'd show up

11:54.381 --> 11:56.281
if you're man enough to compete.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.216
Is this man enough?

11:58.218 --> 11:59.684
(grunting)

11:59.686 --> 12:01.252
Look! Look!
It's up, it's up!

12:01.254 --> 12:03.521
Two inches!
At least two inches!

12:03.523 --> 12:05.990
(bones cracking) Ah, hernia!
Something's very wrong!

12:08.627 --> 12:10.829
Okay, listen up, everybody.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.197
I got a new girlfriend.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.499
She's out on the porch,
she's a lesbian,

12:14.501 --> 12:16.034
she thinks I'm
a lesbian named CJ,

12:16.036 --> 12:18.169
and I'm gonna come out to you,
and you're all

12:18.171 --> 12:19.537
gonna be supportive, all right?

12:19.539 --> 12:20.605
Okay.
Fine.

12:20.607 --> 12:21.973
Whatever.
Seems about right.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.042
CLEVELAND: Wait!
Are we gay, too?

12:24.044 --> 12:27.011
No.
Then you should
probably shave the mustache.

12:27.013 --> 12:29.514
(laughs) Just keeping
everybody loose.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.082
All right, we're re.
Open the door.

12:32.218 --> 12:35.420
Everybody, this is Daisy.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.489
My... girlfriend.

12:37.491 --> 12:40.125
What?!
You're a lesbian, !

12:40.127 --> 12:41.860
Get out of my house!

12:41.862 --> 12:43.828
God don't want this, CJ!

12:43.830 --> 12:45.764
(sobbing):
God don't want this!

12:45.766 --> 12:47.932
I hate this gay family!

12:47.934 --> 12:51.002
Hold up!
Everybody just take a beat.

12:51.004 --> 12:54.272
Now, this here news might be
troubling to some,

12:54.274 --> 12:56.941
but it doesn't change who CJ is.

12:56.943 --> 13:00.145
She's still our kin, and we need
to accept and love her.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.312
He's right!

13:01.314 --> 13:04.449
Come here, CJ.
I accept and love you.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.252
God loves all of his children,
and if he can,

13:07.254 --> 13:09.687
So... can... I.

13:09.689 --> 13:12.123
I love this gay family!

13:12.125 --> 13:13.591
Group hug!

13:13.593 --> 13:17.095
(family sobbing)

13:17.097 --> 13:19.497
Wow, your family loves lesbians.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.400
Yeah, you should see
my dad's Internet history.

13:25.004 --> 13:27.539
Junior, you shouldn't
be messing with the prom.

13:27.541 --> 13:30.275
It's a sacred evet
where kids say goode

13:30.277 --> 13:32.610
to high school
by dancing, drinki,

13:32.612 --> 13:34.879
and giving birth
in a bathroom sta.

13:34.881 --> 13:37.816
I'm giving birth to tolerance
in the bathroom stall

13:37.818 --> 13:40.151
of people's minds!
(car pulls up)

13:40.153 --> 13:41.853
(brakes squeal)

13:41.855 --> 13:43.421
(car door opens, then closes)

13:44.857 --> 13:48.459
Daisy, I thought we agreed
on butch tux, Ellen kicks.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.460
What happened?

13:49.462 --> 13:51.029
I'm not going, CJ.

13:51.031 --> 13:54.132
(giggles) Watch out,
Martina Navratilova.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.701
There's a new
funny lesbian in town.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.203
I'm serious.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.838
The school board
called my parents

13:59.840 --> 14:02.674
and said if we show up, they'll
shut down the whole prom.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.143
Daisy, this is
gonna surprise you,

14:05.145 --> 14:07.378
but I've been bullied
at my school, too.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.813
On account of your voice?

14:08.815 --> 14:10.348
What? No!

14:10.350 --> 14:12.550
But you know what
not fighting back gets you?

14:12.552 --> 14:14.252
More bullying.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.920
I'm sorry, CJ.

14:15.922 --> 14:19.090
I guess I'm just
not the woman you are.

14:20.659 --> 14:21.926
(door opens)

14:21.928 --> 14:22.927
(door closes)

14:22.929 --> 14:24.195
(engine starts)

14:27.333 --> 14:28.933
As God is my witness,

14:28.935 --> 14:30.768
I did not tape all this up
for nothing!

14:30.770 --> 14:34.105
This lesbian is going
to that prom!

14:42.014 --> 14:43.715
You have no ass, Ernie.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.116
No ass.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.318
I'm sorry, but I can't
take you to the prom.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.020
Do we know any real girls?

14:49.022 --> 14:50.922
I'm a real girl.

14:50.924 --> 14:55.093
My stepsister would pretend
to be my lesbian girlfriend?

14:55.095 --> 14:56.261
You would do that for me?

14:56.263 --> 14:58.263
I'd do it for CJ.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.799
And I'll do it for you since I
got you into this to begin with.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.269
Roberta, if you
liked black guys,

15:04.271 --> 15:06.104
I'd kiss you.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.339
So, what am I
supposed to do?

15:08.341 --> 15:11.376
Just stay home by myself and
watch <i>RuPaul's Drag Race?</i>

15:11.378 --> 15:13.211
Nobody said anything
about <i>RuPa...</i>

15:13.213 --> 15:14.812
No, no. I get it.

15:14.814 --> 15:17.115
You want me
to keep the wig on
and watch <i>RuPaul...</i>

15:17.117 --> 15:18.950
No, I'm not
saying that at all.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.052
I'm doing it!

15:22.755 --> 15:23.955
(high-pitched beep)

15:23.957 --> 15:26.724
(indistinct chatter,
phone ringing)

15:27.960 --> 15:29.093
Welcome, contestants.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.362
After today, one of you
will be crowned

15:31.364 --> 15:34.999
the Ultimate Slop Popper Fan,
and will appear on the cover

15:35.001 --> 15:37.035
of <i>Sloppy Seconds Magazine.</i>

15:37.037 --> 15:39.137
So, who's it gonna be?

15:39.139 --> 15:41.039
Popperkingcleve42?

15:41.041 --> 15:43.041
Yay!

15:43.043 --> 15:45.877
Or is it Truepopperking33?

15:45.879 --> 15:46.945
Bring him on!

15:46.947 --> 15:49.047
I'm gonna slop
the floor with this chump!

15:49.049 --> 15:52.216
♪

15:52.218 --> 15:54.953
You're Truepopperking33?!

15:54.955 --> 15:56.287
You're just a kid.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.923
I thought 33
would be your age.

15:58.925 --> 16:02.293
No, it's the number of times
I had sex with your mom!

16:02.295 --> 16:03.294
Oh!

16:03.296 --> 16:04.295
She's an adult.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.097
I'm sure she had her reasons.

16:06.099 --> 16:09.534
Now, to quote our award-winning
1986 ad campaign,

16:09.536 --> 16:13.171
"Lets Stop Talking
and Slop Popping!"

16:14.373 --> 16:17.842
First up, Slop Culture trivia.

16:17.844 --> 16:21.045
Our founder, Miller N. Green,
created the Slop Popper

16:21.047 --> 16:23.448
after being fired
from what field?

16:23.450 --> 16:24.983
CLEVELAND/SPENCER:
Foreskin restoration!

16:24.985 --> 16:26.384
You're both correct!

16:26.386 --> 16:27.919
(crowd applauds)

16:28.921 --> 16:31.589
The year was 1968.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.257
Bobby Kennedy is slain.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.093
A nation mourns.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.128
What kind of Slop Popper did
Walter Cronkite

16:37.130 --> 16:38.429
have in his lap?

16:38.431 --> 16:40.798
Groovy Gravy Flavor!
Correct!

16:40.800 --> 16:43.034
The year was 1994.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.802
Courtney Love was eating
a Slop Popper

16:44.804 --> 16:46.838
when she found
the body of Kurt Cobain.

16:46.840 --> 16:47.939
What flavor was she...

16:47.941 --> 16:49.540
Grungy Gravy Flavor!

16:49.542 --> 16:51.976
I don't remember the '90s.

16:51.978 --> 16:56.047
And now, it all comes down to
The Excellency Round.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.115
(boxing bell dings)

16:57.117 --> 16:58.516
(grunts)
(both panting)

16:58.518 --> 17:00.251
MAN: Stop this madness!

17:01.854 --> 17:04.455
BOTH: Slop Popper creator,
Miller N. Green?!

17:04.457 --> 17:06.324
That's right! What the
hell is going on here?

17:06.326 --> 17:07.992
We're competing to determine

17:07.994 --> 17:10.261
who's the biggest
Slop Popper fan.

17:10.263 --> 17:13.031
What?! My God,
he's just a child!

17:13.033 --> 17:14.532
An overweight child.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.135
And you, you're just a slob.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.771
A fat slob with
a mustache full of cheese.

17:19.773 --> 17:21.339
A "cheese product."

17:21.341 --> 17:24.008
I don't want either of you
associated with my company.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.511
But I'm your
most loyal customer.

17:26.513 --> 17:28.980
I eat five Slop Poppers a day!

17:28.982 --> 17:32.016
As do I, also,
too, as well!

17:32.018 --> 17:33.951
Five a day?!

17:33.953 --> 17:35.153
How are you alive?

17:35.155 --> 17:38.189
Slop Poppers were meant to be a
rare treat,

17:38.191 --> 17:41.025
the delicate reward
for a bridge well built,

17:41.027 --> 17:44.996
a channel well swum, or a
foreskin well restored.

17:44.998 --> 17:47.398
You both make me sick.

17:48.867 --> 17:50.635
You have left me no choice.

17:50.637 --> 17:54.138
Shut down production on all
Slop Poppers-- permanently!

17:54.140 --> 17:56.040
You heard the old man's
rash decision!

17:56.042 --> 17:58.609
Close down the
billion-dollar business!

17:58.611 --> 17:59.610
(grunting)

17:59.612 --> 18:01.112
(powering down)

18:01.114 --> 18:03.181
We...

18:03.183 --> 18:05.817
destroyed the thing...

18:05.819 --> 18:07.852
we love the most.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.688
And I stole $2,200
from your bank account

18:10.690 --> 18:13.324
and registered you as a sex
offender in nine states.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.992
Then I shall move to France,

18:14.994 --> 18:18.463
like that Oscar-winning
child rapist, Roman Polanski.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.998
<i>Au revoir.</i>

18:23.368 --> 18:25.770
You ready to be a gay icon?

18:25.772 --> 18:27.505
I'm like a fat Judy Garland.

18:27.507 --> 18:28.773
No, Junior.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.442
Liza Minnelli is like
a fat Judy Garland.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.311
(forced laugh)

18:33.313 --> 18:34.445
Let's go.

18:47.092 --> 18:50.128
(crowd murmuring)

18:50.130 --> 18:52.463
You're not welcome here.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.632
Your non-traditiol
sexual preference

18:54.634 --> 18:56.601
is ruining everyons
good time.

18:56.603 --> 18:57.835
You were warned.

18:57.837 --> 19:00.037
If you don't leave now,
we will shut down

19:00.039 --> 19:01.939
this prom for everyone.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.207
(louder grumbling and booing)

19:03.209 --> 19:05.143
All right, I'll go.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.378
But I want to
say something first.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.780
(record scratching)
(microphone feedback)

19:09.782 --> 19:14.118
Hi. I'm CJ, the one you all
assume is a lesbian.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.454
Well, the truth is,
I'm not a lesbian.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.022
I'm a boy.

19:18.024 --> 19:19.357
(record scratches)
Hey!

19:19.359 --> 19:21.659
And my date?
She's my sister.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.427
(record scratches)
Stop it!

19:23.429 --> 19:26.030
I was supposed to
come here with someone else.

19:26.032 --> 19:29.033
But she was bullied not to come
because she's different.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.202
You should be proud
of who you are.

19:31.204 --> 19:32.870
I tried to change who I was.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.105
And look what happened.

19:34.107 --> 19:36.207
I'm a guy pretending
to be a girl,

19:36.209 --> 19:38.476
at a prom, at a school
I don't go to,

19:38.478 --> 19:41.512
with my sister as half
of a lesbian couple.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.981
Daisy, what are you doing here?

19:43.983 --> 19:45.516
I thought you might try
something like this,

19:45.518 --> 19:47.385
and I wanted to make sure
you were okay.

19:47.387 --> 19:50.521
I just didn't know
you had a penis!

19:50.523 --> 19:52.523
I'm sorry I lied to you.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.959
Hey, I'm the one who thought
you were a lesbian

19:54.961 --> 19:57.528
just because you look exactly
like a black Chaz Bono.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.664
(both laugh)

19:59.666 --> 20:02.934
Come on, CJ, let these kids
have their stupid prom.

20:02.936 --> 20:05.002
