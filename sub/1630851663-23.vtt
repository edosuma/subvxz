Narrator:
Tonight on "Shark Tank"...

00:02.503 --> 00:03.837
Hey, Sharks, we're here
to solve a big problem.

00:06.106 --> 00:07.975
Today,
we're fishing for Sharks.

00:07.975 --> 00:08.976
I knew it!

00:08.976 --> 00:10.444
I don't like
your approach.

00:10.444 --> 00:11.845
This isn't
the direction.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.480
Cut the throat, man.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.782
For me, there's a huge elephant
in the room.

00:15.782 --> 00:17.718
Are you losing money?
Yeah.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.020
How much?
Depending on the month,
somewhere between 40K and 50K.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.788
What?!
What a head-squeezer.

00:21.788 --> 00:23.056
This story's getting
better and better.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.299
Narrator: First in the Tank

00:32.299 --> 00:36.036
is a cosmetic company
for an underserved market.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.147
Hey, Sharks.
I'm Jon.

00:47.147 --> 00:48.315
And I'm Devir.

00:48.315 --> 00:51.084
We're from New York,
and we're seeking $600,000

00:51.084 --> 00:53.520
in exchange
for 5% of our company, Stryx.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.588
Oh, God.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.123
Do you know
what everybody in this room

00:56.123 --> 00:57.591
has in common
right now,

00:57.591 --> 00:59.626
besides
being on television?

00:59.626 --> 01:01.328
We're all
wearing makeup.

01:01.328 --> 01:02.896
But chances are,
the women are fine

01:02.896 --> 01:04.398
applying
and wearing makeup,

01:04.398 --> 01:06.533
but most men aren't nearly
comfortable enough

01:06.533 --> 01:07.868
to admit or use it.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.303
Sharks,
this happened to me

01:09.303 --> 01:10.637
on the day
of my wedding.

01:10.637 --> 01:13.740
The greatest day of my life,
and I woke up with a zit.

01:13.740 --> 01:14.741
And not just
any zit.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.343
As you can see...

01:16.343 --> 01:18.579
Ew.
...I mean, this thing was
the mother of all zits, okay?

01:18.579 --> 01:20.013
It was a volcano.

01:20.013 --> 01:22.149
It was just waiting
to erupt. Yuck.

01:22.149 --> 01:24.751
And while there were makeup
artists there at the wedding,

01:24.751 --> 01:26.720
I was too embarrassed
to do anything about it,

01:26.720 --> 01:28.589
and so my blemishes
were there to stay

01:28.589 --> 01:31.224
for the thousands of photos
that were taken that day.

01:31.224 --> 01:33.060
Every guy has an experience
like this,

01:33.060 --> 01:34.494
whether
it's a first date,

01:34.494 --> 01:36.697
an important pitch
like here on "Shark Tank,"

01:36.697 --> 01:38.265
or just
coffee with a friend.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.233
When you look your best,
you feel your best,

01:40.233 --> 01:42.202
which is why Stryx
is changing the way

01:42.202 --> 01:44.771
that men can instantly
fix their appearance with,

01:44.771 --> 01:46.807
you guessed it,
it's makeup for men.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.742
Stryx is
the first company ever

01:48.742 --> 01:51.244
to engineer cosmetic
and skincare products

01:51.244 --> 01:53.380
with completely
custom formulations

01:53.380 --> 01:55.382
and packaging
geared towards men.

01:55.382 --> 01:57.417
We launched
with a sleek, discreet,

01:57.417 --> 01:59.119
and very sexy
concealer tool

01:59.119 --> 02:00.287
and a tinted moisturizer,

02:00.287 --> 02:02.522
and since then,
we've launched seven products

02:02.522 --> 02:05.359
at the intersection
of cosmetics and skincare

02:05.359 --> 02:07.361
so that you can instantly
fix your appearance,

02:07.361 --> 02:09.496
including our
energizing eye tool

02:09.496 --> 02:11.732
and our beard
and brow gel comb.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.634
So, Sharks,
who's ready to join us

02:13.634 --> 02:15.035
and show the world...

02:15.035 --> 02:16.703
Both: There's nothing wrong
with handsome.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.840
So we don't have pens
in front of you.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.174
It's actually
our concealer tool,

02:21.174 --> 02:22.676
so if you
take a look there.

02:22.676 --> 02:25.012
So we have it designed
as a pen

02:25.012 --> 02:26.380
so that it's sleek
and discreet.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.547
O'Leary: So this is just
a concealer?

02:27.547 --> 02:28.615
Correct.

02:28.615 --> 02:30.150
Cuban: So let me start
at the beginning.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.020
What does concealer do, and what
are you supposed to do with it?

02:33.020 --> 02:34.721
So the formulation
is made

02:34.721 --> 02:36.023
so that if you want
to cover up a pimple,

02:36.023 --> 02:37.591
if you want to cover up
dark under-eye circles,

02:37.591 --> 02:38.925
you just dab it on
and you're done,

02:38.925 --> 02:42.029
so you don't need a primer,
a foundation, a sponge,

02:42.029 --> 02:43.397
a brush,
a setting powder.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.132
It's made to be
as easy as possible

02:45.132 --> 02:46.933
for guys
to cover up any problems.

02:46.933 --> 02:48.769
And with the concealer tool,
we found out

02:48.769 --> 02:51.238
one of the best uses for it
that guys were using it for

02:51.238 --> 02:53.740
is for dark under-eye circles,
like under-eye bags. Right.

02:53.740 --> 02:56.677
And so that's what led us to
launch the energizing eye tool,

02:56.677 --> 02:58.045
which is also
in front of you.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.479
It tightens the skin
underneath the eye,

02:59.479 --> 03:01.815
so it's meant to reduce
fine lines, wrinkles,

03:01.815 --> 03:03.450
and it's really
an anti-aging type of product.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.519
But how are you supposed to
even know how to do it?

03:05.519 --> 03:08.021
Like, to me,
it's like war paint, you know?

03:08.021 --> 03:10.490
You just, like, see a streak.
I mean, now what?

03:10.490 --> 03:11.858
That looks good.
Greiner:
Mark, really?

03:11.858 --> 03:14.161
So that's a huge thing
that we need to work on

03:14.161 --> 03:15.529
as part
of this brand,

03:15.529 --> 03:17.064
is education
around these products.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.432
Herjavec:
Good job, Mark.

03:18.432 --> 03:20.767
I actually use a product
like this all the time.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.135
Of course you do.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.037
I don't sleep enough,
so I get really baggy eyes.

03:24.037 --> 03:27.541
There's lots of products --
eye creams, everything --

03:27.541 --> 03:28.909
that are made for men.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.044
Correct.
You're saying
you're a brand-new category.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.446
What's the brand-new category?

03:32.446 --> 03:34.514
Nobody's approached
the cosmetic category

03:34.514 --> 03:35.615
from this angle.

03:35.615 --> 03:37.350
Like, for me,
when I was younger,

03:37.350 --> 03:39.186
I was bullied
out of my middle school

03:39.186 --> 03:40.721
because I put gel
in my hair,

03:40.721 --> 03:43.790
and that hit my confidence
for years.

03:43.790 --> 03:46.126
People bullied you because
you put gel in your hair?

03:46.126 --> 03:47.294
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I had the same thing.

03:47.294 --> 03:48.462
This was also,
I mean --
Seriously?

03:48.462 --> 03:49.996
John: I would love to hear,
though, why this.

03:49.996 --> 03:51.465
I mean,
were you guys chemists?

03:51.465 --> 03:53.200
Were you guys
in this industry at all?

03:53.200 --> 03:54.835
So, no.
So when we first started,

03:54.835 --> 03:57.537
I partnered with
two professional makeup artists.

03:57.537 --> 03:59.372
They helped us
really be able to formulate

03:59.372 --> 04:01.241
the first-ever really
cosmetic products

04:01.241 --> 04:02.943
for men's skin
as opposed to women,

04:02.943 --> 04:04.845
so what had happened was
is I raised

04:04.845 --> 04:06.613
half a million dollars
to start.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.148
You what?
That was
before I raised

04:08.148 --> 04:10.217
half a million dollars
to launch the company. Wow.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.351
Who did you
raise it from?

04:11.351 --> 04:13.720
Friends, family,
and then connections.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.021
You got some
really good friends.

04:15.021 --> 04:16.289
O'Leary: What portion of
the company did you give away

04:16.289 --> 04:17.357
for the $500,000?

04:17.357 --> 04:20.827
So at the time,
we raised at about,

04:20.827 --> 04:23.296
you know,
a $1.5 million valuation.

04:23.296 --> 04:24.564
How long ago was that?

04:24.564 --> 04:26.700
That was
back in 2018. Okay.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.335
And now you're
at a $12 million valuation

04:28.335 --> 04:30.203
because you have amazing sales.
What are they?
Yes.

04:30.203 --> 04:34.107
So this year, we're at about
$130,000 in sales.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.609
That's it?

04:35.609 --> 04:36.610
Per month.
Per month.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.711
- Per month.
- Per month.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.146
I knew it!

04:39.146 --> 04:40.647
Greiner:
What's lifetime sales?

04:40.647 --> 04:42.182
About $2 million.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.316
$2 million? Okay.
Yes.

04:43.316 --> 04:46.119
How are you selling
$130,000 a month?

04:46.119 --> 04:49.623
Well, a big one is D2C,
ecom, retail, our own site.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.892
So we're about 95% D2C,

04:51.892 --> 04:55.395
and then last year,
we launched in CVS nationwide.

04:55.395 --> 04:57.264
We're the first
men's cosmetic brand.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.732
I'm amazed you got to CVS.
Good for you.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.067
For us, like,
retail is really

05:01.067 --> 05:02.502
a validation point.

05:02.502 --> 05:04.638
In CVS, we actually sit
in the shave aisle.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.639
We're not
in a cosmetic aisle.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.073
We're not
in the women's aisle,

05:07.073 --> 05:08.675
so we wanted to show
these products --
Oh. Clever.

05:08.675 --> 05:09.709
Yeah --
Can be normalized.

05:09.709 --> 05:10.777
What do
you sell them for?

05:10.777 --> 05:12.145
What's your average
selling price?

05:12.145 --> 05:13.613
It's around $30.

05:13.613 --> 05:15.315
85% gross margins.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.616
So why the --
why the value--

05:16.616 --> 05:18.018
I mean,
'cause you do understand

05:18.018 --> 05:21.421
that there's probably a family
that risked it all

05:21.421 --> 05:22.989
and they just needed
a shot.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.492
And you know you took
that space from them.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.860
Daymond, that's not fair
to do that, right?

05:26.860 --> 05:28.929
Every entrepreneur
wants a shot, right?

05:28.929 --> 05:30.197
At $12 million valuation,
Mark?

05:30.197 --> 05:31.464
Yeah,
it doesn't --

05:31.464 --> 05:33.033
Look, if it's gonna be worth
$200 million in 3 days,

05:33.033 --> 05:34.000
then it's cheap, right?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.035
But let me
ask a different question.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.503
It may be worth crap
in two days.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.438
Yeah, well,
so is every company facing that.

05:38.438 --> 05:39.673
So let me
ask a question.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.107
Oh, you're gonna give them
a $12 million, Mark?

05:41.107 --> 05:42.509
So when you raised
that much money

05:42.509 --> 05:45.612
and give away basically 1/3 of
your company at that point --

05:45.612 --> 05:46.947
Sorry,
I didn't hear that, Mark.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.481
Are you saying when you raised
the half a million,

05:48.481 --> 05:49.649
you gave up 1/3?

05:49.649 --> 05:51.218
It was a little bit
less than that.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.786
We have raised more
since then, actually.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.454
Oh, that's what
I was getting to, right?

05:54.454 --> 05:56.223
So how much do you guys own
right now?

05:56.223 --> 05:57.357
Between the two of us,

05:57.357 --> 06:00.460
we own a little bit more
than 1/3 of the company.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.596
Okay, so that's why you need
such a high valuation.
Herjavec: Got it.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.798
Because if you're asking
for that much money...
Devir: Well --

06:04.798 --> 06:06.433
...that's the only way you're
gonna retain any equity.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.201
Oh, my God.
Herjavec:
And so the total raise

06:08.201 --> 06:10.537
from beginning
was how much?

06:10.537 --> 06:13.406
Historical, right around
$1.5 million total raised.

06:13.406 --> 06:14.908
Wow.
O'Leary: Okay,
and if you do this run rate

06:14.908 --> 06:16.209
right now
at $130,000 a month,

06:16.209 --> 06:19.512
that's about $1.5 million
in sales for this calendar year.

06:19.512 --> 06:20.614
How much you
gonna make off that?

06:20.614 --> 06:22.282
We are not
net profitable.

06:22.282 --> 06:23.483
Everything we're making

06:23.483 --> 06:25.518
is going right back
into marketing, growth.

06:25.518 --> 06:26.953
Are you losing money?

06:26.953 --> 06:28.388
Yeah.
How much?

06:28.388 --> 06:31.191
Uh, depending on the month,
somewhere between 40K and 50K.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.626
- Can we get back to the product?
- Okay, so let's ask why.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.194
Mark, this story's
getting better and better.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.529
So let's find out why, right?
Because the margins are huge.

06:36.529 --> 06:38.298
Yes, 85%.
So if you're burning

06:38.298 --> 06:41.468
that much cash,
you are spending it somewhere.

06:41.468 --> 06:42.469
Yeah. Yeah.

06:42.469 --> 06:43.470
Advertising or...

06:43.470 --> 06:45.372
Yep, it's marketing primarily,

06:45.372 --> 06:47.340
but we're expecting to see
5X to 6X return

06:47.340 --> 06:48.475
on the acquisition cost.

06:48.475 --> 06:49.643
Of course you are.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.845
Why did you guys
decide to go to retail?

06:51.845 --> 06:54.714
Because that takes
a lot more capital

06:54.714 --> 06:56.516
in order to drive
sell-through...
It's true.

06:56.516 --> 06:58.385
...whereas
direct to consumer,

06:58.385 --> 07:00.387
you can get a return on ad
spend and see it directly, so
why did you make that choice?

07:00.387 --> 07:02.489
Correct.
But I love
the retail strategy, Mark,

07:02.489 --> 07:04.624
because I wouldn't know
about the product,

07:04.624 --> 07:06.893
but if I go to a CVS
in the shaving aisle,

07:06.893 --> 07:08.228
I'm gonna see
the product. Yeah,
but that's so expensive.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.663
It's also
very validating.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.298
Our number-one competitor
is the stigma here,

07:11.298 --> 07:13.033
so for guys
to see these products

07:13.033 --> 07:15.602
right next to other
brands that they know and
love and have used --

07:15.602 --> 07:17.437
Yeah, but I'm not saying
that's wrong, right?

07:17.437 --> 07:18.805
But one
of the biggest things

07:18.805 --> 07:21.274
I try to teach my entrepreneurs
is conserve your cash.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.442
Yeah.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.544
Because stuff happens,
and so you're gonna

07:24.544 --> 07:27.314
have to raise
more than this $600,000, too.

07:27.314 --> 07:29.983
So now you guys are gonna
have to give away 10%,

07:29.983 --> 07:33.186
15%, 20% of your 33%,

07:33.186 --> 07:36.222
and then you guys are gonna
end up with nothing.

07:36.222 --> 07:38.391
For me, there's a huge elephant
in the room,

07:38.391 --> 07:40.026
and that is
that this packaging

07:40.026 --> 07:42.996
tells me nothing
about your product whatsoever.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.531
And Stryx, the name.

07:44.531 --> 07:47.334
I have no idea
it's makeup for men at all,

07:47.334 --> 07:50.503
so you could probably be selling
so much better

07:50.503 --> 07:52.772
if those things
were clear on here.

07:52.772 --> 07:55.909
And for those reasons,
I'm out.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.811
Thank you.
Thank you.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.479
The valuation's
a little high.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.915
I'd really rather
work with people

08:01.915 --> 08:03.283
who need it
a little bit more,

08:03.283 --> 08:06.252
not second raising
and all that kind of money.

08:06.252 --> 08:07.354
This is just not
a business for me.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.822
I'm out.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.323
Thank you.
Thank you.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.492
Cuban:
I love the category.

08:12.492 --> 08:16.029
I mean, I think it's been due
for a long, long time,

08:16.029 --> 08:17.731
but I don't like
your approach.

08:17.731 --> 08:21.434
You try to hide the fact
that it's makeup a little bit.

08:21.434 --> 08:23.703
I think you got to own it more
because that's the only way

08:23.703 --> 08:25.605
you're gonna change
hearts and minds.

08:25.605 --> 08:29.809
If you convince bro culture
to do it, you change everything.

08:29.809 --> 08:31.945
I would take
a completely different approach.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.646
You know,
you guys have made your choices,

08:33.646 --> 08:35.815
so for those reasons,
I'm out.

08:35.815 --> 08:37.350
Thank you. Thanks.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.518
I'm not gonna tell you
how to run your business.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.153
I expect you to do that
on your own.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.888
I'm just an investor.

08:41.888 --> 08:43.556
When I see a good idea,
I like it.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.025
I don't like
your valuation.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.426
I don't think you're worth
12 million bucks, okay?

08:46.426 --> 08:47.894
Sorry.
I just don't.

08:47.894 --> 08:49.362
Herjavec: Oh, I think there's
a royalty coming.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.597
Cuban:
Yeah, I think so, too.

08:50.597 --> 08:51.831
- Sounds like it, yeah.
- There may be.

08:51.831 --> 08:52.899
In fact, it's because
I understand your issue

08:52.899 --> 08:54.968
around your
capital needs.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.270
If you're getting into retail
with CVS and others,

08:57.270 --> 08:59.806
you're gonna get POs,
and it's tying up your capital.

08:59.806 --> 09:02.042
The more you grow,
the more capital is tied up,

09:02.042 --> 09:03.610
so the way I'm gonna
structure my offer

09:03.610 --> 09:06.780
is I'm gonna give you $300,000
as a factoring loan.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.616
36 months, 11 1/2%, okay?

09:09.616 --> 09:10.750
Oh.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.153
The other $300,000 is equity
for 2 1/2%,

09:13.153 --> 09:17.257
and I'm putting a royalty on it
on per package of 2 bucks

09:17.257 --> 09:20.326
until I get my $600,000 back
'cause you can afford it.

09:20.326 --> 09:23.696
And then it drops down
to 25 cents in perpetuity,

09:23.696 --> 09:25.999
which is nothing,
but I'm part of the game.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.934
Kevin,
I think you actually

09:27.934 --> 09:30.003
hit a new low
with this offer.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.005
Well, if you have something
better, Robert, feel free.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.506
Not only are you
being a loan shark,

09:33.506 --> 09:36.376
you're also adding
a royalty to it.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.977
Yeah.
I think this is
the first time.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.112
If you have --
<i>And</i> equity!

09:39.112 --> 09:40.313
Listen,
it's an offer.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.082
I don't hear any others.
What's your offer?

09:53.726 --> 09:55.795
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out.

09:55.795 --> 09:58.631
Jon and Devir have an offer
on the table from Kevin

09:58.631 --> 10:01.034
for their makeup brand
for men, Stryx,

10:01.034 --> 10:03.470
but Robert may also
be interested.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.638
Herjavec: Not only are you
being a loan shark,

10:05.638 --> 10:08.441
you're also adding
a royalty to it.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.843
Yeah.
I think this is
the first time.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.311
If you have --
<i>And</i> equity!

10:11.311 --> 10:13.513
What's your offer?

10:13.513 --> 10:16.349
Yeah, I think Kevin's
double dipping

10:16.349 --> 10:17.617
on his offer
with you guys.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.952
Sounds like triple.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.053
Or quadruple.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.721
You've heard
a lot of negatives

10:21.721 --> 10:23.490
about what you could
do better,

10:23.490 --> 10:27.127
but the one thing we can't
argue with is the sales.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.729
Yeah.
Whatever you're doing,
it's working.

10:29.729 --> 10:33.666
My advice would be
this isn't the direction.

10:33.666 --> 10:37.003
The guy on this picture
is already buying makeup.

10:37.003 --> 10:38.905
You've got to get
somebody like me,

10:38.905 --> 10:41.207
and I think you could do really,
really well

10:41.207 --> 10:43.543
and create a big business.
Is there an offer
in all this verbiage?

10:43.543 --> 10:44.878
I mean,
we'll take compliments, as well.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.346
We take feedback
and compliments.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.815
I think the scariest thing
about his offer is

10:48.815 --> 10:51.518
when you have
a royalty in perpetuity,

10:51.518 --> 10:53.052
who's gonna buy
that company?
Right.

10:53.052 --> 10:55.121
You got to do
an equity deal.

10:55.121 --> 10:57.924
I'll give you
the $600,000...

10:57.924 --> 10:59.092
for 10%.
Ouch.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.527
I think getting a Shark

11:00.527 --> 11:02.929
can really help you
with the platform.

11:02.929 --> 11:05.298
I think you're
on to something.
What an interesting
dilemma you have.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.033
Robert,
would we be able

11:07.033 --> 11:10.470
to meet in the middle
at 7 1/2%?

11:10.470 --> 11:12.605
I want to stick to the 10%.
I'm in this.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.674
I don't want to go in
for a short time.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.477
I don't need a royalty.
I'm in it for the long run.

11:17.477 --> 11:20.780
We're gonna build something,
and let's go for it.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.718
Mr. Wonderful,
we really want to be

11:25.718 --> 11:28.321
on the wedding
platform of love

11:28.321 --> 11:30.523
because
the wedding story,

11:30.523 --> 11:33.393
this is great for grooms
and groomsmen...

11:33.393 --> 11:35.628
but, Robert,
you got a deal.

11:35.628 --> 11:38.131
Yeah!
Alright.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.599
Good job, guys.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.234
I would never
make fun of you for wearing gel.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.436
What's going on
with that?

11:43.436 --> 11:44.938
I wear so much gel.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.306
Oh, that was
a great job, guys.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.373
Really,
really good job.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.474
Good job, guys. Congrats.

11:48.474 --> 11:49.909
Thank you.
Thank you.

11:49.909 --> 11:51.878
Jon: You know,
we really, like,

11:51.878 --> 11:54.380
had reasons
we wanted each of the Sharks.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.748
Robert's the most handsome, though,

11:55.748 --> 11:57.183
and he's gonna
help us show everybody

11:57.183 --> 11:58.618
there's nothing wrong
with handsome.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.453
Men on makeup,
it's like years ago,

12:00.453 --> 12:02.689
when Botox
was a taboo.

12:02.689 --> 12:06.092
Now you mention it,
and nobody lifts an eyebrow.

12:07.193 --> 12:08.962
One of the worst jokes.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.467
Narrator: In Season 10,
Kelsey Moreira pitched

12:14.467 --> 12:16.536
her edible
cookie-dough company, Doughp,

12:16.536 --> 12:18.037
and left without a deal
from a Shark.

12:18.037 --> 12:19.572
It's not something

12:19.572 --> 12:21.374
that is a healthy enough
option for me.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.576
Let's see
what she's up to now.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.944
Moreira: It was pretty crushing
to leave

12:24.944 --> 12:27.213
without a deal that day,
but I did take away

12:27.213 --> 12:29.449
a little nugget of advice
from the Sharks.

12:29.449 --> 12:33.019
I made a portion-controlled
product called Doughp Drops.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.722
Doughp was created after
I made the amazing decision

12:35.722 --> 12:37.023
to get sober.

12:37.023 --> 12:39.692
I rediscovered my love of baking
and really who I was.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.461
I pitched to the Sharks
to open up

12:41.461 --> 12:43.529
a new brick-and-mortar store
in Las Vegas.

12:43.529 --> 12:45.064
Though I didn't get funding
in the Tank,

12:45.064 --> 12:46.666
I found some outside capital,

12:46.666 --> 12:48.568
and I was able
to open up that store.

12:48.568 --> 12:51.638
In 2019,
I did $1.2 million in sales.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.072
Then the pandemic hit,

12:53.072 --> 12:57.510
and if you fast-forward to 2020,
we did $2.7 million in sales.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.879
And $2.5 million of that
was online,

12:59.879 --> 13:01.447
so it made the most sense
to close

13:01.447 --> 13:04.150
our brick-and-mortar storefront
to focus entirely online,

13:04.150 --> 13:06.853
where our mission
can reach more people than ever.

13:06.853 --> 13:09.622
We just rolled out
at Costco and Walmart,

13:09.622 --> 13:12.725
and we are live at Harmons,
New Seasons, and Foxtrot.

13:12.725 --> 13:15.128
Edible dough,
and you can bake it.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.864
Moreira: We recently aired
on QVC, and it went so well

13:17.864 --> 13:19.465
that they're bringing us back
later this year

13:19.465 --> 13:20.867
to show off our Doughp Drops.

13:20.867 --> 13:21.934
You're going down
a wrong path.

13:21.934 --> 13:22.969
You go,
"You know what?

13:22.969 --> 13:24.504
I'm gonna return
to a passion of mine,

13:24.504 --> 13:25.672
which is baking."

13:25.672 --> 13:27.206
Way to go, woman.

13:27.206 --> 13:30.543
My sales when I pitched to
the Sharks was around $800,000.

13:30.543 --> 13:35.281
4 years later, our lifetime
sales are $9.4 million.

13:35.281 --> 13:39.052
Now I'm happily married, and I'm
going on seven years sober.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.554
And we started
the Doughp for Hope initiative.

13:41.554 --> 13:44.490
Doughp for Hope has donated
more than $60,000,

13:44.490 --> 13:46.492
working to break the stigma
around mental health

13:46.492 --> 13:48.661
and addiction recovery.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.663
I want to make sure that
if there's anybody out there

13:50.663 --> 13:52.465
who is struggling,
reach out for help.

13:52.465 --> 13:55.234
There is a lot of joy
waiting on the other side.

13:55.234 --> 13:57.970
What we're doing at
Doughp for Hope and the messages

13:57.970 --> 14:01.040
that I get from customers
are exactly what fuels me

14:01.040 --> 14:03.242
to fight another day
and reach more people

14:03.242 --> 14:06.145
and hope that we can change
more lives along the way.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.858
Narrator:
Next up is a product

14:18.858 --> 14:21.094
to make water sports
more comfortable.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.504
Hey, Sharks.
My name is Wes.

14:31.504 --> 14:32.538
And I'm Greg.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.273
We paddled up
the coast of California

14:34.273 --> 14:35.842
to see if you want
to take a bite

14:35.842 --> 14:37.543
out of our company...

14:37.543 --> 14:38.945
Both: Driftline.

14:38.945 --> 14:41.013
We're here today
seeking $100,000

14:41.013 --> 14:42.915
for 10% equity
in our company.

14:42.915 --> 14:45.918
Driftline is a revolutionary
water-sports apparel brand

14:45.918 --> 14:47.420
based out
of San Diego.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.555
We're here to solve
a big problem.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.224
See,
a couple of years ago

14:51.224 --> 14:53.025
during a dawn patrol
surf session,

14:53.025 --> 14:54.827
it was that transitional
time of year

14:54.827 --> 14:57.697
where the water was just
too warm for a full wetsuit

14:57.697 --> 14:59.599
and too cold for your
traditional board shorts.

14:59.599 --> 15:00.600
A net liner?

15:00.600 --> 15:02.168
Do people even still wear
these things?

15:02.168 --> 15:03.970
They're
insanely uncomfortable

15:03.970 --> 15:05.838
and don't provide
any warmth or protection.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.640
There has to be
a better way.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.742
And that's why
we created Drifties.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.412
Drifties are the premier
two-in-one board short

15:12.412 --> 15:14.514
with a patent-pending
wetsuit liner

15:14.514 --> 15:16.816
connected to a stylish
outer shell,

15:16.816 --> 15:19.719
offering comfort,
warmth, and chafe protection

15:19.719 --> 15:22.155
specifically designed
for water sports.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.157
And we've all seen
that guy at the beach

15:24.157 --> 15:25.358
doing the classic waddle

15:25.358 --> 15:27.627
to avoid the excruciating pain
of chafing,

15:27.627 --> 15:29.695
but with Drifties'
cloud-like wetsuit liner,

15:29.695 --> 15:30.930
we solved that problem

15:30.930 --> 15:32.999
while keeping you warm
and supported.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.167
Drifties have been tested

15:34.167 --> 15:36.202
by almost every
water-sport athlete out there.

15:36.202 --> 15:37.804
They've also been tested

15:37.804 --> 15:41.107
in the most extreme conditions
all over the globe.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.776
And remember, you never
want to swim with sharks...

15:43.776 --> 15:45.077
Both:
Without your Drifties.

15:45.077 --> 15:46.879
Good job, guys.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.948
So each of you has a pair
of Drifties in front of you.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.551
It feels like a neoprene.
Is it a neoprene?
That's what it is.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.587
Neoprene is a rubber foam
that basically stores heat

15:54.587 --> 15:56.255
and prevents
that initial cold shock

15:56.255 --> 15:58.724
that you see guys get when
they first step in the water.

15:58.724 --> 16:03.496
So basically, it's a wetsuit
married to board shorts.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.331
Correct.
We combined the two.

16:05.331 --> 16:06.899
Hadn't really been done before, actually.

16:06.899 --> 16:09.035
Yeah, we actually have applied
for our utility patent on it,

16:09.035 --> 16:10.336
and hopefully get it
in the next couple months.

16:10.336 --> 16:11.838
Good for you guys.
It seems
really smart to me.

16:11.838 --> 16:14.407
I mean, I will tell you,
it's really great quality.

16:14.407 --> 16:15.575
Tell us
about your sales.

16:15.575 --> 16:16.809
Currently,
year to date,

16:16.809 --> 16:19.378
we're actually
at about $125,000 in sales.

16:19.378 --> 16:21.714
Last year, we did
about $100,000 in sales,

16:21.714 --> 16:24.817
and we're projected on pace
to do about $200,000 this year.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.686
How are you selling these --
direct to consumer,

16:26.686 --> 16:28.888
do you put them
in specialty stores?

16:28.888 --> 16:31.624
So right now, we're actually
99% direct to consumer.

16:31.624 --> 16:34.360
Are you spending a lot of money
to get people to your site?

16:34.360 --> 16:35.561
Actually,
not really.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.363
This past year,
we only really spent

16:37.363 --> 16:38.998
about $10,000
in marketing.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.200
What does it cost?
Sorry, you never told us.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.135
So those retail
for $89.

16:43.135 --> 16:45.905
It costs $25 to make,
$33 landed.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.874
I'm surprised.
I mean, that's not bad at all.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.509
- Not bad at all.
- Because this is complicated.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.843
Yeah, well,
that's why we went through

16:50.843 --> 16:52.345
so many
different manufacturers

16:52.345 --> 16:54.680
and iterations to get the real
material and product we need.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.983
And is your history
in manufacturing?

16:56.983 --> 17:00.086
No, actually, I had
a sales marketing background.

17:00.086 --> 17:02.321
I actually was taking night
classes for graphic design,

17:02.321 --> 17:03.723
which is
my full-time now,

17:03.723 --> 17:05.825
and that's kind of
what spawned the idea.

17:05.825 --> 17:08.628
When we had that legitimate
lightbulb moment on the beach,

17:08.628 --> 17:11.063
I needed a project for school,
and I was like,

17:11.063 --> 17:13.065
"Well, let's just, you know,
see if I can brand this."

17:13.065 --> 17:14.267
That's great.
That's great.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.768
And by the end,
we actually had a business.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.470
And you did it.
What's your background?

17:17.470 --> 17:19.305
So I'm actually
a financial background,

17:19.305 --> 17:21.707
and now I'm more in tech
and marketing sales.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.310
Herjavec: It is
a fantastic idea.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.746
What I'm struggling
with is

17:26.746 --> 17:29.315
can you sell enough
just shorts

17:29.315 --> 17:32.151
to make
a sustainable business?

17:32.151 --> 17:33.786
That's part of
where we have this patent

17:33.786 --> 17:35.087
that we're
hopefully gonna get

17:35.087 --> 17:36.455
in the next
couple of months here,

17:36.455 --> 17:38.424
but really,
what we're building

17:38.424 --> 17:39.859
is not
just for surfing.

17:39.859 --> 17:42.194
We're also expanding
into water sports

17:42.194 --> 17:45.364
that need specific iterations
on the actual product

17:45.364 --> 17:46.999
specifically for
that sport.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.434
Give me an example
of that.
So, for instance,

17:48.434 --> 17:50.436
kayaking is different
from surfing,

17:50.436 --> 17:52.171
and you can add
additional lengths

17:52.171 --> 17:53.906
to the neoprene
and things like that.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.342
So you can iterate under
the umbrella of the patent

17:56.342 --> 17:58.377
specifically for
different water sports.

17:58.377 --> 18:00.179
How much money
will you guys make this year?

18:00.179 --> 18:01.781
We're pretty much
break even at this point

18:01.781 --> 18:03.950
'cause we're putting
everything back into R&D,

18:03.950 --> 18:05.518
and honestly,
right now,

18:05.518 --> 18:07.320
we have
that funnel of people

18:07.320 --> 18:08.754
that want
to buy our product.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.823
We just need to place
bigger purchase orders

18:10.823 --> 18:13.492
to drive down the cost
and increase the margins.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.161
Herjavec: Do you have
the orders,

18:15.161 --> 18:17.163
or do you think
you'll get orders

18:17.163 --> 18:18.698
if you drive down
the cost?

18:18.698 --> 18:21.200
So we've already sold out
of SKUs and styles

18:21.200 --> 18:22.802
for this
upcoming season,

18:22.802 --> 18:24.804
and the problem is
now people want them.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.339
So you cannot keep up
with the orders at the moment.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.373
No.

18:27.373 --> 18:29.075
It's a very good innovation.

18:29.075 --> 18:31.310
You know,
I look at million valuation.

18:31.310 --> 18:32.812
I don't think that's
that crazy,

18:32.812 --> 18:34.947
but I just don't know
how big this market is.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.482
That's the only reason
I'm out.

18:36.482 --> 18:40.252
I just don't feel
the scaling of it.

18:40.252 --> 18:42.488
This is not for me.
I'm out.

18:42.488 --> 18:47.994
This is a really phenomenal job
you've done in the creativity,

18:47.994 --> 18:49.729
putting
the two things together,

18:49.729 --> 18:51.530
but, you know,
I like to hit, like,

18:51.530 --> 18:52.932
a broad,
mass audience.

18:52.932 --> 18:56.569
Love it, love you,
but because it's niche, I'm out.

18:56.569 --> 18:59.338
I'm not sure about
the expansion,

18:59.338 --> 19:01.774
like you were saying,
how easy that's gonna be,

19:01.774 --> 19:04.310
but I do believe
that if you're in that world,

19:04.310 --> 19:05.711
you buy a pair,

19:05.711 --> 19:07.780
you're never gonna go back
to a regular... Right.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.181
...board short again,
right?

19:09.181 --> 19:11.784
But there's two other Sharks
here that are in the space.

19:11.784 --> 19:14.587
Mark, he's had rockstar numbers
with the paddleboard company,

19:14.587 --> 19:16.055
and, Robert,
you have --

19:16.055 --> 19:17.823
Hamboards, Sand Cloud,

19:17.823 --> 19:19.659
and Tipsy Elves
out of San Diego.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.993
I think you need
a collaboration

19:20.993 --> 19:23.029
with somebody who can
bring you other people,

19:23.029 --> 19:25.164
members and other people
marketing collectively.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.832
You don't compete.
You complement each other.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.467
So I don't think
I can add any value here.

19:28.467 --> 19:30.670
I'm out.
I appreciate it.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.138
Cuban: Hey, guys, congrats on
what you've accomplished.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.406
It's super smart.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.241
My problem is I don't know
if it can be big enough.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.910
You know, you can be a
$2 million, $3 million company,

19:37.910 --> 19:39.812
but it's really not
a fit for me.

19:39.812 --> 19:42.381
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

19:42.381 --> 19:45.017
Herjavec: Yeah, you know,
I'm definitely in this space,

19:45.017 --> 19:47.319
but it's got
to be enough...

19:47.319 --> 19:49.855
Yeah.
...that it's worth
my time.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.657
We know
this space well.

19:51.657 --> 19:53.759
We can really help you
with all that.

19:53.759 --> 19:56.362
I just can't do it
for 10%.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.864
What can you do it for,
Robert?

19:58.864 --> 20:01.067
I'll actually give you
a little more money.

20:01.067 --> 20:04.270
There's a term I love,
which is accelerate to fail,

20:04.270 --> 20:05.871
meaning I think
you got to go faster

20:05.871 --> 20:08.340
to find that breaking point
in the business.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.242
Yeah.
Let's not do this
for 10 years.

20:10.242 --> 20:12.044
Let's accelerate.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.479
I sense
an offer coming

20:13.479 --> 20:15.681
that's going to be
very painful.

20:15.681 --> 20:19.385
I'll give you a $150,000,
but I want 1/3.

20:19.385 --> 20:20.619
Ouch.

20:20.619 --> 20:22.154
I'm chafing.
I'm chafing.

20:22.154 --> 20:23.189
Oh.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.227
I mean, I -- we very much
appreciate that.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.831
Would you
bump that down to 15%?

20:31.831 --> 20:32.898
No.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.333
Okay.
No, no.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.535
There is only one Shark
that's in

20:36.535 --> 20:38.871
because I think I understand
the complexity

20:38.871 --> 20:40.239
and how hard this is. Yeah.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.008
If you get the patent --
if we get the patent --

20:43.008 --> 20:44.877
we're gonna
more than $150,000.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.679
It's a whole nother... Scale.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.547
Like at this point, though,

20:48.547 --> 20:52.084
a little more money,
let's go faster.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.919
Well, Greg and I --
I mean...

20:55.588 --> 20:57.423
You know, Wes,
I can't read lips,

20:57.423 --> 20:58.891
so you don't have to
cover your mouth.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.926
Yeah, that's fair.
That's fair.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.528
I mean,
we definitely,

21:02.528 --> 21:04.630
you know, love the work
that you've done in the space.

21:04.630 --> 21:07.500
I mean, would you do something
down to 20%?

21:07.500 --> 21:10.035
I mean, can we get you
to that number?
No, no.

21:10.035 --> 21:12.371
I just -- I know
how much work it is.

21:12.371 --> 21:13.906
I mean,
I think the highest

21:13.906 --> 21:15.508
we could probably go
is 25%.

21:17.076 --> 21:18.544
Robert,
that's reasonable.

21:18.544 --> 21:19.845
It is reasonable.

21:19.845 --> 21:22.181
I'm offering you more money.
Let's not forget that.

21:22.181 --> 21:24.116
And, you know, honestly,
if I'm worth 25%, I'm worth 33%.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.985
Cuban: That's a steal
for you, Robert.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.553
And that's what I felt
comfortable with.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.588
That's my gut feel.

21:29.588 --> 21:31.557
I'll give you $100,000
for 20%.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.593
Greiner: Wow.

21:34.593 --> 21:36.562
But you got
to take it right now.

21:36.562 --> 21:38.430
Say yes.

21:38.430 --> 21:41.100
I think the highest we can
go for that is 15%.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.936
Yeah, guys, I mean, think about
what's on the table right now.

21:43.936 --> 21:46.572
I offered you
$100,000 for 20%.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.974
You only have 5% flexibility,
and you said you need us.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.877
I mean, I guess you're
indecisive, so I'm out again.

21:53.779 --> 21:55.548
What are you gonna do,
Robert?

21:55.548 --> 21:57.616
I think if you're comfortable
at 25%,

21:57.616 --> 21:59.251
you're comfortable
at 28%.

21:59.251 --> 22:01.353
I'll come down
from 33% to 28%.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.093
What a head-squeezer.

22:08.093 --> 22:09.261
Yeah.

22:09.261 --> 22:12.031
I mean, we came here
kind of with numbers in mind,

22:12.031 --> 22:14.233
so unfortunately, we're gonna
have to pass at that number.

22:14.233 --> 22:16.001
You got to do
what you gotta do.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.037
Thank you, though.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much, Sharks.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.206
Good luck, guys. Congrats.
Way to stick to your guns.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.843
We just weren't willing
to give up 1/3

22:23.843 --> 22:25.277
of what we've worked
so hard at,

22:25.277 --> 22:26.345
but at
the end of the day,

22:26.345 --> 22:28.047
we didn't feel like
his heart was in it.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.348
And that's
what we're in for,

22:29.348 --> 22:31.851
so, you know,
for that reason, we were out.

22:38.824 --> 22:41.660
Narrator: Next in the Tank
is a functional accessory

22:41.660 --> 22:43.662
for your furry pals.

22:46.832 --> 22:48.200
Aww.

22:52.671 --> 22:53.806
Hi, Sharks.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.307
I'm Shannon from
Austin, Texas,

22:55.307 --> 22:57.276
and this is my dog, Rishi.

22:57.276 --> 22:59.311
And I'm Griffin
from Oxnard, California,

22:59.311 --> 23:03.048
and we're seeking $400,000
for 6% equity in our company.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.450
Wow.

23:04.450 --> 23:07.353
More and more, our dogs
are going everywhere with us --

23:07.353 --> 23:09.688
in the car, on a hike,
to brunch,

23:09.688 --> 23:11.891
even on our
stand-up paddleboards.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.793
While our relationship with dogs
has completely modernized,

23:14.793 --> 23:17.363
most dog products are still
clunky, inconvenient,

23:17.363 --> 23:19.798
or something even your dog
would be embarrassed by.

23:19.798 --> 23:22.334
The most important thing
that your dog needs,

23:22.334 --> 23:24.303
besides pets and cuddles,
is water.

23:24.303 --> 23:25.771
But who here
has tried

23:25.771 --> 23:28.440
the "make your hand
into a bowl" method?

23:28.440 --> 23:31.443
It's messy, wastes water,
and doesn't work well.

23:31.443 --> 23:34.480
Or you can pour the contents
of your water bottle

23:34.480 --> 23:36.015
into a portable bowl...

23:36.015 --> 23:37.983
and when your dog
doesn't drink at all,

23:37.983 --> 23:39.785
you're left
having to throw it out.

23:40.886 --> 23:42.655
And public water bowls
can infect your pup

23:42.655 --> 23:44.223
with creepy bacteria.

23:44.223 --> 23:45.724
And let's be honest,

23:45.724 --> 23:48.327
we know you kiss
that mouth daily.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.299
So we invented
the Springer travel bottle,

23:53.299 --> 23:55.134
the best way
to give your dog water

23:55.134 --> 23:56.669
anywhere
at any time.

23:56.669 --> 23:57.836
Come here, bud.

23:57.836 --> 23:59.905
Simply squeeze
the bottle.

23:59.905 --> 24:02.007
The bowl will
fill up with water.

24:02.007 --> 24:03.609
When your dog
is done drinking,

24:03.609 --> 24:04.677
release the bottle,

24:04.677 --> 24:06.845
and the water
goes back into the bottle.

24:06.845 --> 24:09.348
No mess, no fuss,
and no wasting water.
Cuban: That's pretty cool.

24:09.348 --> 24:10.950
This is
just the first

24:10.950 --> 24:13.218
of many innovative products
in the pipeline

24:13.218 --> 24:15.454
that solve problems
that pet owners face every day.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.190
So, Sharks,
who's ready to join our pack

24:18.190 --> 24:21.660
and make Springer
top dog of the pet industry?

24:21.660 --> 24:23.662
It's really
a good idea.

24:23.662 --> 24:25.164
If it falls sideways,
does it leak?

24:25.164 --> 24:26.865
So there is
a leak-tight shut-off.

24:26.865 --> 24:28.067
We have to
tighten it?

24:28.067 --> 24:29.301
So you twist it
in the middle.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.502
Okay,
then it doesn't leak.

24:30.502 --> 24:32.204
Yes, and then it's
completely leak-tight.

24:32.204 --> 24:33.305
Greiner: Wow.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.673
Alright, so, listen,
tell us about you.

24:34.673 --> 24:36.008
How did you
come up with this?

24:36.008 --> 24:37.843
Our dad
is an inventor.

24:37.843 --> 24:40.012
He invented the first travel mug
35 years ago.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.313
Cuban: You guys
are brother and sister?

24:41.313 --> 24:42.448
Yes, my brother.

24:42.448 --> 24:44.683
So Griffin and I
actually started our careers

24:44.683 --> 24:47.319
as models
for the company.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.422
Oh, my God!
You're so cute.

24:50.422 --> 24:51.423
That's great.

24:51.423 --> 24:53.726
A few years ago,
I adopted Rishi.

24:53.726 --> 24:56.996
I became part of the demographic
of crazy dog parents

24:56.996 --> 24:58.731
that would do anything
for their dog

24:58.731 --> 25:00.866
but whose problems
weren't being addressed,

25:00.866 --> 25:02.401
and that's when
Springer was born.

25:02.401 --> 25:04.370
So what
am I investing in?
Springer.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.205
So we created
a new pet brand,

25:06.205 --> 25:08.107
Springer,
that sells this bottle.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.608
So this
is your first product.

25:09.608 --> 25:11.710
Yes.
Right?
Do you have any patents?

25:11.710 --> 25:14.313
Yes, we have eight patents
covering these products.

25:14.313 --> 25:15.581
Greiner: Eight?
Eight.

25:15.581 --> 25:17.016
Wow.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.485
Utility, design in the U. S.
and internationally.

25:19.485 --> 25:21.020
Cuban: So when did you start
going to market,

25:21.020 --> 25:22.287
and how
were you selling it?

25:22.287 --> 25:24.890
Our first year of sales
was in 2016,

25:24.890 --> 25:27.659
and we did about $711,000
in revenue in the first year.

25:27.659 --> 25:28.994
Wow.

25:28.994 --> 25:30.529
For the next
couple years,

25:30.529 --> 25:34.967
we sold between about $650,000
and $750,000 per year,

25:34.967 --> 25:37.903
and in 2020, we got
$1.7 million in sales.

25:37.903 --> 25:39.838
Wow.
And how much money
did you make?

25:39.838 --> 25:41.440
'Cause there's got to be
great margins.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.775
Yeah,
there are great margins.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.743
Yeah.
We made $100,000, and --

25:44.743 --> 25:45.911
That's not great.

25:45.911 --> 25:47.579
That's it?
$100,000?

25:47.579 --> 25:48.847
Yeah,
so last year,

25:48.847 --> 25:51.183
we decided it was gonna be
a growth year for us,

25:51.183 --> 25:53.385
so we reinvested
a lot of our profit

25:53.385 --> 25:55.387
into more IP, branding,

25:55.387 --> 25:58.090
building out new innovations
that are coming later this year.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.158
So tell us your margins.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.459
What does it cost
to make one of these?

26:00.459 --> 26:03.729
It is about $3 on average
to make one of these products.

26:03.729 --> 26:06.365
Our margins on retail
are 88%.

26:06.365 --> 26:09.701
Our mini --
the mini sells for $22,

26:09.701 --> 26:12.204
the medium size sells
for $25,

26:12.204 --> 26:13.705
and the growler
sells for $28.

26:13.705 --> 26:16.408
Those are great margins,
but where'd the money go?

26:16.408 --> 26:18.377
The $6.4 million valuation

26:18.377 --> 26:20.279
is a bit of a stretch
for a single-product company,

26:20.279 --> 26:22.481
but actually,
you're just breaking even.

26:22.481 --> 26:24.483
You're making $100,000
on $1.7 million.

26:24.483 --> 26:25.984
I'm calling that
breaking even.

26:25.984 --> 26:29.588
I'm looking for $500,000
worth of costs

26:29.588 --> 26:31.623
that I don't understand
where they are.

26:31.623 --> 26:34.026
Something is
eating up $500,000.

26:34.026 --> 26:35.694
You got
88% gross margins.

26:35.694 --> 26:37.229
Yeah, and something else
doesn't add up.

26:37.229 --> 26:39.932
We had a lot of investment in IP
and brand protection because --

26:39.932 --> 26:41.500
What was
the total expense of that?

26:41.500 --> 26:43.502
For branding,
it was about $150,000, website.

26:43.502 --> 26:44.837
Yeah, but you see how
all this doesn't add up,

26:44.837 --> 26:47.806
'cause those expenses
are accrued over five years.

26:47.806 --> 26:49.141
You know, so --
Well, a lot of it

26:49.141 --> 26:51.477
went invested
in the last year,

26:51.477 --> 26:53.412
and those are
one-time expenses.

26:53.412 --> 26:54.980
And then
we have a team,

26:54.980 --> 26:56.882
so it's us,
our parents.

26:56.882 --> 26:59.585
We have
two other employees in-house.

26:59.585 --> 27:01.019
What do you guys make?

27:01.019 --> 27:02.488
We make about $70,000.

27:02.488 --> 27:04.857
Look, I think the products
are really cool, right?

27:04.857 --> 27:06.558
They're ingenious
in a lot of respects,

27:06.558 --> 27:07.893
but what concerns me

27:07.893 --> 27:10.395
is that you've been
selling it for five years.

27:10.395 --> 27:12.197
I'm surprised
it hasn't done a lot more.

27:12.197 --> 27:14.533
For those reasons,
I'm out.

27:14.533 --> 27:16.902
Who is the person that came up
with the brilliant idea

27:16.902 --> 27:19.872
of only
offering us 6%?

27:19.872 --> 27:22.474
So to justify that,
we're on track this year

27:22.474 --> 27:24.143
to sell $2 million,

27:24.143 --> 27:28.480
and next year,
we're projected at $3.2 million.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.649
We can give you the money.
Is that all you want?

27:30.649 --> 27:31.850
We want
your expertise.

27:31.850 --> 27:33.685
We got to work, too,
for the money, right?

27:33.685 --> 27:36.555
For 6%? Really?
- What expertise do you need?

27:36.555 --> 27:38.223
John: Really?
You want me to pay

27:38.223 --> 27:41.326
and get a small return
and then work for you?

27:41.326 --> 27:44.029
It doesn't make
any sense to me.
We primarily --

27:44.029 --> 27:45.864
It's not worth my time.
I'm out.

27:45.864 --> 27:47.432
Okay.
Thank you.

27:47.432 --> 27:49.968
I think
it's a very good product,

27:49.968 --> 27:51.803
but I can't get past
one thing.

27:51.803 --> 27:54.540
And it might be
my own bias,

27:54.540 --> 27:56.542
and it might be my age.

27:56.542 --> 28:01.013
But the thing I was taught
is when you start a business,

28:01.013 --> 28:04.183
the first thing that gets paid
is the business.

28:04.183 --> 28:08.220
And the last thing
that gets paid is the owner.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.588
Yes,
and that's why the --

28:09.588 --> 28:11.223
And you're doing it
the opposite.

28:11.223 --> 28:13.725
You're paying yourself
$70,000 a year.

28:13.725 --> 28:16.929
I mean, you're starving
the business for cash

28:16.929 --> 28:18.597
to make a living.

28:18.597 --> 28:21.567
I don't want to be part of that.
I'm out.

28:21.567 --> 28:23.569
O'Leary: Okay, so let me
take a stab at this, alright?

28:23.569 --> 28:27.539
What I like about
this deal is sales.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.976
I love cash flow.
This is a family business.

28:30.976 --> 28:32.711
The only way
I would do this deal is

28:32.711 --> 28:35.047
I want to stay out of that soup,
alright?

28:35.047 --> 28:38.150
With a 6% ownership,
I have no say anyways.

28:38.150 --> 28:41.186
This is a royalty deal.
It keeps everything aligned.

28:41.186 --> 28:43.989
My interest to sell more
is very high,

28:43.989 --> 28:46.358
so I'll give you
the $400,000.

28:46.358 --> 28:47.826
I want 3% equity,

28:47.826 --> 28:50.829
as schmuck insurance,
in case the product gets sold

28:50.829 --> 28:52.998
while I'm in my royalty
agreement with you. Okay.

28:52.998 --> 28:55.500
And I want $3 a unit

28:55.500 --> 28:58.437
until I get my $400,000 back,

28:58.437 --> 29:01.473
and then I want half of that,
$1.50, in perpetuity.

29:01.473 --> 29:04.676
I have lots of people
can blow this up digitally,

29:04.676 --> 29:06.778
and I would do that 'cause
my interests are aligned.

29:06.778 --> 29:08.213
And that's my offer.

29:08.213 --> 29:09.214
Okay.
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah, thank you for your offer.

29:09.214 --> 29:10.215
We really appreciate
your offer.

29:10.215 --> 29:12.150
Thank you.
I love this.

29:12.150 --> 29:15.554
I think it is so smart
and so innovative,

29:15.554 --> 29:18.857
and just, like,
why would you use anything else?

29:18.857 --> 29:20.592
Yeah.
I'm gonna
make you an offer.

29:20.592 --> 29:24.896
I'm gonna give you
the 400K for 10%,

29:24.896 --> 29:27.899
but I want
preferred stock.

29:27.899 --> 29:31.770
Which means I would get
distributions first

29:31.770 --> 29:34.773
whenever there's profits
that are paid out.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.141
Awesome.
Okay.

29:36.141 --> 29:38.944
Thank you for your offer.
Would you do it for 8%?

29:38.944 --> 29:41.680
No, I got to stick at 10%,
you guys, come on.

29:41.680 --> 29:42.848
It's risky,

29:42.848 --> 29:46.118
and I got to be excited
to get out of bed.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.661
Lori, we'd be happy
to do that deal with you.

29:55.661 --> 29:56.928
- Yay!
- You got a deal!

29:59.097 --> 30:00.932
Yeah, Rishi!

30:00.932 --> 30:02.167
Fluffy, bite her.

30:02.167 --> 30:04.069
My first
inventor family!
Yay!

30:04.069 --> 30:05.203
Whoo!

30:07.139 --> 30:08.607
- We're so excited.
- So good.

30:08.607 --> 30:10.242
I'm so happy to be part
of the family.

30:10.242 --> 30:11.376
Bye, you.

30:11.376 --> 30:12.511
See you, guys. Congratulations.

30:12.511 --> 30:13.578
Well done.

30:13.578 --> 30:14.646
Enjoy those products, too.
Thank you.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.249
Whoo!

30:17.249 --> 30:18.950
Griffin: Now that we have Lori
on our team,

30:18.950 --> 30:20.452
we're ready
to blitz the market.

30:20.452 --> 30:21.887
She was
the ideal Shark for us.

30:21.887 --> 30:24.189
We feel like she's already part
of our Springer family.

30:24.189 --> 30:26.725
Whoo!
Whoo! Yes!

30:26.725 --> 30:28.160
Whoo!
We made a deal!

30:40.305 --> 30:42.174
Narrator:
Next up is a company

30:42.174 --> 30:45.210
that combines two loves
into one product.

30:55.253 --> 30:56.922
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Chase Terrell,

30:56.922 --> 30:58.557
and I'm from Sand Springs, Oklahoma.

30:58.557 --> 31:01.493
My name's Chris Diede,
and I live in Austin, Texas.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.662
This is my son
and my brother-in-law,

31:03.662 --> 31:05.897
and I'm Jake Rutledge,
the inventor of...

31:05.897 --> 31:08.600
Together:
The Chill-N-Reel!

31:08.600 --> 31:11.169
Today, we're fishing
for $300,000

31:11.169 --> 31:12.771
for a 10% stake
in our company.

31:12.771 --> 31:15.040
Wow.
My dad has solved

31:15.040 --> 31:17.809
one of the world's
<i>biggest</i> problems.

31:21.980 --> 31:25.016
Hold my beer!

31:26.485 --> 31:27.552
Chase,
hold my beer!

31:27.552 --> 31:28.587
I can't, man!

31:28.587 --> 31:29.821
My hands are full
over here, too!

31:29.821 --> 31:32.124
How am I supposed to
reel in this fish

31:32.124 --> 31:34.659
and hold my beer
at the same time?

31:36.361 --> 31:39.231
Together:
There's got to be a better way!

31:39.231 --> 31:41.900
That's why I invented
the Chill-N-Reel,

31:41.900 --> 31:44.302
the only drink insulator
you can fish with

31:44.302 --> 31:45.670
and the only
drink insulator

31:45.670 --> 31:47.606
with a hand-line reel
on the side.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.541
If you enjoy fishing,

31:49.541 --> 31:51.443
you know
how much of a hassle it is

31:51.443 --> 31:54.312
to pack all your gear
just to casually...

31:54.312 --> 31:55.580
pitch out a line.

31:59.151 --> 32:01.853
No way.
Obviously, the Chill-N-Reel
was not made

32:01.853 --> 32:03.321
to reel in a marlin.

32:03.321 --> 32:04.556
However,
what it <i>was</i> made for

32:04.556 --> 32:08.293
is nothing short
of a <i>real</i> good time.

32:08.293 --> 32:09.861
We have the Chill-N-Reel
designed to be

32:09.861 --> 32:13.031
easily cast-able, reel-able,
and, of course, drinkable.

32:13.031 --> 32:15.033
Just pitch it out,
grab your slack,

32:15.033 --> 32:17.636
and tip it back
and start reeling them in cold.

32:17.636 --> 32:21.006
We've caught bass, crappie,
and catfish on the Chill-N-Reel,

32:21.006 --> 32:23.442
but today,
we're fishing for Sharks.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.610
Together:
Who's gonna take a bite?

32:25.610 --> 32:26.745
Nice, nice.

32:26.745 --> 32:29.448
Where's the rod?
Like, how is the rod --

32:29.448 --> 32:30.649
That is the rod.

32:30.649 --> 32:31.950
Cuban:
There is no rod.
That's the rod?!

32:31.950 --> 32:33.685
All: This is it.

32:33.685 --> 32:35.654
Lori, with the fish you're
catching, this is good enough.

32:35.654 --> 32:38.156
So this just is basically
for smaller fish.

32:38.156 --> 32:39.491
You're not taking it
that serious, right?

32:39.491 --> 32:41.593
So how much pound test line
is on here?

32:41.593 --> 32:43.228
Eight-pound test
is on there.

32:43.228 --> 32:44.429
Eight pounds?

32:44.429 --> 32:47.599
Actually, I have thrown
50-pound braid on there,

32:47.599 --> 32:49.835
and I've caught
16-pound blue cat.

32:49.835 --> 32:52.604
I caught a 3 1/2-foot
hammerhead shark.

32:52.604 --> 32:54.139
Really?!
Yes.

32:54.139 --> 32:55.974
If you hold the line and try
to reel it, it'll cut your hand,

32:55.974 --> 32:59.511
but if you sit here
and use this as your crank --

32:59.511 --> 33:01.112
O'Leary:
Is that in Florida?
Yes.

33:01.112 --> 33:02.481
So tell us
what's happening there.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.683
Well, I'm reeling a fish in
right now.

33:04.683 --> 33:05.884
Where's the fish?

33:05.884 --> 33:07.986
He's coming.
He's coming.

33:07.986 --> 33:11.122
Boy, that's a big boy.
That's a big boy.

33:11.122 --> 33:12.190
Come on!

33:12.190 --> 33:14.159
Where's the shark?!

33:14.159 --> 33:15.760
I don't have my phone
or I'd pull it out and show you.

33:15.760 --> 33:16.761
Wah-wah.

33:16.761 --> 33:18.296
I hope they send it back,
right?

33:18.296 --> 33:19.598
Oh, yeah.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.299
Let's be clear, though,
this is not --

33:21.299 --> 33:22.734
it's not made
for the big guys.

33:22.734 --> 33:23.735
It's for those days

33:23.735 --> 33:25.270
when you just
want to chill and reel.

33:25.270 --> 33:26.972
It's fascinating.

33:26.972 --> 33:29.741
I got to know, what happened
to you guys to invent this?

33:29.741 --> 33:31.343
Okay,
here's the story.

33:31.343 --> 33:34.479
My family, we're on a family
vacation down in Florida,

33:34.479 --> 33:36.348
and we're all out
in the water drinking a beer.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.617
And I look down and
there's fish everywhere.

33:38.617 --> 33:42.020
Well, I got to catch those fish,
and my buddies looked at me.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.655
They said, "Man,
you bring a rod out here,

33:43.655 --> 33:45.824
you are gonna upset
everybody out here."

33:45.824 --> 33:47.359
I said, "Hey, watch this."

33:47.359 --> 33:48.960
I didn't even have to say,
"Hold my beer."

33:48.960 --> 33:52.631
I just went in, tied some line
onto the bottom of my koozie,

33:52.631 --> 33:53.999
wrapped it around,
would come out,

33:53.999 --> 33:55.300
pull all the string out,

33:55.300 --> 33:57.636
throw it out,
catch a fish, reel it in.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.704
I just kept spilling my beer everywhere.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.339
Did you catch anything?
Oh, yeah.

34:01.339 --> 34:02.807
We were always
catching fish.

34:02.807 --> 34:04.543
Jake,
what's your background?

34:04.543 --> 34:07.345
I've been a Tulsa firefighter
for 21 years.

34:07.345 --> 34:08.980
Good for you.
Thank you.

34:08.980 --> 34:13.485
So I have always wanted
to come up with something.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.153
And never
did you ever dream

34:15.153 --> 34:17.789
you'd be fishing
and drinking

34:17.789 --> 34:18.857
and ending up
on "Shark Tank."

34:18.857 --> 34:20.025
That's it.

34:20.025 --> 34:22.227
O'Leary: Why don't we start with
last year's sales

34:22.227 --> 34:24.262
and now what you're
gonna do this year?

34:24.262 --> 34:25.797
Well, I'll tell you,
the last 12 months,

34:25.797 --> 34:27.732
we've done
$1.34 million in sales.

34:27.732 --> 34:28.967
- What?
- You got to be kidding me?

34:28.967 --> 34:30.302
On this crap?

34:30.302 --> 34:31.836
This little thing.

34:31.836 --> 34:33.572
A lot of chill anglers
out there.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.373
Was not expecting
that answer.

34:35.373 --> 34:37.809
Yeah.
$1.3 million
in a year?

34:37.809 --> 34:39.210
That's right.
In the last 12 months.

34:39.210 --> 34:41.112
So last year,
up until June,

34:41.112 --> 34:43.148
there had been
$50,000 in sales,

34:43.148 --> 34:46.117
and then from then on, we
finished the year at $680,000.

34:46.117 --> 34:47.352
What about this year?

34:47.352 --> 34:49.287
This year, we're at
about $760,000 so far.

34:49.287 --> 34:51.556
Okay, and what do you think
you'll make this year?
So far.

34:51.556 --> 34:53.959
About $1.65 million.
Damn!

34:53.959 --> 34:56.995
So, guys, this thing is
a total little piece
of crap selling a ton.

34:58.029 --> 34:59.030
That's what I thought!

34:59.030 --> 35:00.565
I thought
the exact same thing

35:00.565 --> 35:01.666
until I saw this --

35:01.666 --> 35:03.668
that there was
this response that happened

35:03.668 --> 35:05.570
from people
who just want to be out,

35:05.570 --> 35:07.606
hang out on the water,
float the river.

35:07.606 --> 35:10.041
What does it cost to make,
and what do you sell one for?

35:10.041 --> 35:12.911
They sell for $12.95
for the solid colors,

35:12.911 --> 35:16.147
$15 for the camos.

35:16.147 --> 35:18.116
They cost us $2.06,

35:18.116 --> 35:21.653
and we manufacture
in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
All made in Oklahoma.

35:21.653 --> 35:22.921
Did you throw a lot of money
on marketing?

35:22.921 --> 35:24.155
We did. Okay.

35:24.155 --> 35:25.390
Yes.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.392
How much have you spent
in the last 12 months?

35:27.392 --> 35:28.693
Spent about 40%.

35:28.693 --> 35:30.061
So $400,000?

35:30.061 --> 35:31.363
Yes.
Little lower.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.098
Around $400,000.

35:33.098 --> 35:35.634
So -- Wow. So take out
the advertising cost.

35:35.634 --> 35:36.635
Yeah.

35:36.635 --> 35:39.270
What's your net margin?

35:39.270 --> 35:42.674
Last year, we made
a little over $70,000.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.309
And how much have you made
this year?

35:44.309 --> 35:47.112
This year,
we are negative $25,000.

35:47.112 --> 35:49.748
We just placed an order
for 54,000.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.182
So that's where
your cash went.

35:51.182 --> 35:52.250
Right.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.152
We've got $350,000
worth of inventory

35:54.152 --> 35:55.654
in our warehouse
right now.

35:55.654 --> 35:58.490
Look,
the thing is so ridiculous,

35:58.490 --> 36:01.493
but I can't help
but respect the sales.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.194
1.65 million bucks.

36:03.194 --> 36:05.397
I mean,
that's just --

36:05.397 --> 36:06.965
But it's such
a piece of crap.

36:07.966 --> 36:09.934
Look,
I wish you the best,

36:09.934 --> 36:11.302
but I can't invest
in this.

36:11.302 --> 36:12.637
I'm out.

36:12.637 --> 36:15.240
Oh, well, we hope
you'll reconsider.

36:16.474 --> 36:17.942
It's fun
for you guys.

36:17.942 --> 36:19.678
It's not investable
for me.

36:19.678 --> 36:22.113
It's not really a company
for me, you know?

36:22.113 --> 36:23.948
But I wish you
good luck.

36:23.948 --> 36:25.750
I love
what you've done.

36:25.750 --> 36:27.118
I'm out.

36:27.118 --> 36:28.119
Thank you, Lori.

36:28.119 --> 36:29.354
One thing I'd like to add, though,

36:29.354 --> 36:30.555
just so
you're all aware,

36:30.555 --> 36:32.957
we all think there's
some opportunities to license

36:32.957 --> 36:35.527
the technology, as well,
which happens to be patented.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.696
Reeling in on koozie?

36:37.696 --> 36:39.864
The drink insulator
that you can fish with.

36:39.864 --> 36:42.367
I want to be the patent officer
that saw that one.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.170
Daymond.

36:45.170 --> 36:47.872
What?
What are you gonna do?

36:47.872 --> 36:49.474
It's a great,
fun business.

36:49.474 --> 36:52.043
We're selling good times,
and people are buying.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.344
People are buying.
I don't want to ruin
your good time,

36:53.344 --> 36:55.780
but as an investor,
I'm not gonna have as much fun.

36:55.780 --> 36:57.415
Right?
I didn't come up with it.

36:57.415 --> 37:00.018
I'm not with you guys
every day running it.

37:00.018 --> 37:02.153
I just don't think it's for me,
so I'm out.

37:02.153 --> 37:04.322
Thank you.
I'm sorry to hear that.

37:04.322 --> 37:05.423
Herjavec: Mark?

37:05.423 --> 37:07.959
Look, guys, I've got
two fundamental problems.

37:07.959 --> 37:10.829
One, there's just not enough
net margin to it, right?

37:10.829 --> 37:12.997
You're spending 40%
on your advertising,

37:12.997 --> 37:14.365
and so that's really
where you've got

37:14.365 --> 37:15.834
to kind of
make it better.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.435
Right.
But even
if you did a lot better,

37:17.435 --> 37:20.772
there's not enough margin
left there for an investor,

37:20.772 --> 37:22.273
so that's
the first problem.

37:22.273 --> 37:25.577
But the bigger problem is,
as somebody who lives in Texas,

37:25.577 --> 37:27.879
if you can't hold your beer
no matter what,

37:27.879 --> 37:29.080
you're doing it wrong.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.415
So I'm out.

37:31.516 --> 37:34.119
Look,
I've been really thinking

37:34.119 --> 37:35.920
'cause first,
I was completely out,

37:35.920 --> 37:37.589
then I was
completely in,

37:37.589 --> 37:39.491
and one of you
said it --

37:39.491 --> 37:42.460
you're selling fun,
and people want fun.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.028
We just had
a year of COVID.

37:44.028 --> 37:45.697
We were all
locked up at home.

37:45.697 --> 37:48.266
People want excitement
and fun,

37:48.266 --> 37:49.701
and you're really
selling them,

37:49.701 --> 37:51.936
for a very small
price point,

37:51.936 --> 37:54.072
you're selling them fun.

37:54.072 --> 37:58.877
My issue is,
you know,

37:58.877 --> 38:01.613
there isn't enough room
in this deal.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.281
Like,
you guys are in a boat,

38:03.281 --> 38:06.117
and the boat
is staying afloat.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.186
but if I come in,
it's gonna sink.

38:08.186 --> 38:10.321
Or we're gonna get
a lot bigger of a boat.

38:10.321 --> 38:13.291
Gonna need a bigger boat.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.826
Diede: Where I think
we can really optimize

38:14.826 --> 38:17.395
on that margin with
the marketing and advertising

38:17.395 --> 38:19.697
is we've seen this year
as a branding year.

38:19.697 --> 38:21.166
That's what's been expensive,
I think,

38:21.166 --> 38:22.400
especially
this first year.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.868
That'll crunch in
as we get awareness.

38:23.868 --> 38:26.237
Chris, I've made
crazier investments

38:26.237 --> 38:28.006
and done really well.

38:28.006 --> 38:29.541
I just don't know.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.910
I mean,
I love the fun.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.145
I love the beer.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.014
This deal is
all about royalties.

38:36.014 --> 38:38.049
Oh!

38:49.661 --> 38:52.597
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out,

38:52.597 --> 38:55.366
and Robert is on the fence
about investing in Chill-N-Reel,

38:55.366 --> 38:57.836
a fishing reel
and beverage koozie.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.671
This deal is
all about royalties.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.139
Oh!

39:01.139 --> 39:03.808
What are you gonna do,
Robert?

39:04.976 --> 39:08.146
I will give you
the $300,000.

39:08.146 --> 39:12.951
I'll keep 10% as equity,
and I'll take $2...

39:12.951 --> 39:14.586
- Ooh.
- Ay, Chihuahua.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.287
...per reel.

39:16.287 --> 39:19.190
I like it. My first royalty
deal. This is exciting.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.159
Learn, grasshopper. Learn.

39:21.159 --> 39:23.561
What do you think?

39:23.561 --> 39:24.696
You have the margin
to do it.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.798
How long is the royalty
in place, Robert?

39:26.798 --> 39:29.167
As long as we're having
a good time, Daymond.

39:32.837 --> 39:35.840
So that's the difference
between Robert and Kevin.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.376
He said it very nicely,
but that means perpetuity.

39:39.777 --> 39:41.412
Cut the throat, man.

39:41.412 --> 39:42.914
You guys can counter.

39:42.914 --> 39:45.016
Uh...

39:45.016 --> 39:48.319
I don't think we're in
for royalties.

39:48.319 --> 39:49.621
Smart man.

39:49.621 --> 39:52.023
If you wanted
to go...

39:52.023 --> 39:55.126
15% for $300,000...

39:55.126 --> 39:56.728
we can do that.

39:56.728 --> 39:59.264
You don't like the royalty,
but you don't mind the equity.

39:59.264 --> 40:00.265
Right. Right.

40:00.265 --> 40:01.833
I mean, the money --

40:01.833 --> 40:04.903
Money's great,
but we're here for a partner.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.739
Alright.
$300,000. 35%.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.041
O'Leary: Ay, Chihuahua!

40:10.041 --> 40:12.176
It's not
a hard negotiation.

40:12.176 --> 40:13.845
I'm taking a flier
on you guys.

40:13.845 --> 40:16.247
I think you've really
figured out something.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.582
It may go somewhere.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.817
I'm willing to risk
the $300,000,

40:19.817 --> 40:23.154
and I've worked really hard
for $300,000.

40:23.154 --> 40:24.822
You know, people always
sit up here and they think,

40:24.822 --> 40:26.658
"Oh, it's just money
to you guys."

40:26.658 --> 40:29.460
I remember the days
where I worked my ass off

40:29.460 --> 40:32.997
for, you know, 10 bucks,
so it's a lot of money.

40:32.997 --> 40:34.499
I believe in you guys.

40:34.499 --> 40:36.868
That's my offer --
$300,000, 35%.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.303
You want to take it?

40:38.303 --> 40:40.471
I'm happy to go along
for the boat ride.

40:40.471 --> 40:42.373
If not, we'll have
a beer together.

40:42.373 --> 40:44.909
Would you go to 20%?

40:46.144 --> 40:47.512
No, no.

40:47.512 --> 40:48.880
Okay.

40:48.880 --> 40:53.084
I appreciate the offer,
but we're gonna have to decline.

40:53.084 --> 40:54.319
Way to
stick to your guns, guys.

40:54.319 --> 40:55.353
Thank you.
Good job.

40:55.353 --> 40:57.155
Cheers.
Thank you, guys.

40:57.155 --> 40:58.957
One, two, three.

41:01.159 --> 41:03.361
I have no idea
what we're saying, but drink.

41:03.361 --> 41:04.562
No idea.

41:04.562 --> 41:05.530
Thank you, guys.
Greiner:
Thank you, guys.

41:05.530 --> 41:06.597
Keep having fun
and making money.

41:06.597 --> 41:07.598
Appreciate it.
Thank you, guys.

41:07.598 --> 41:08.566
Good luck, guys.

41:09.867 --> 41:11.336
What were
they thinking?

41:11.336 --> 41:13.037
I don't know.

41:13.037 --> 41:14.205
That's surprised me.

41:14.205 --> 41:15.974
Everybody --
They thought it was fun.

41:15.974 --> 41:19.010
Everybody in the U. S.
is gonna think it was fun.

41:19.010 --> 41:20.411
We didn't catch
a Shark today,

41:20.411 --> 41:22.447
but hey, there's lots of sharks
out there.

41:22.447 --> 41:24.782
We'll go out
and catch one tomorrow...

41:24.782 --> 41:26.751
Together:
With the Chill-N-Reel.

41:26.751 --> 41:29.554
What a total piece of
and $1.6 million.

41:29.554 --> 41:30.755
Like, that's just --

41:30.755 --> 41:32.757
They were spending all that
money on advertising.

41:32.757 --> 41:33.758
That was the problem.

41:33.758 --> 41:35.293
That was a lot of money,
a lot.

41:35.293 --> 41:37.328
It was converting,
but it's a lot of money.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.830
Kevin,
I was so excited there.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.264
I thought I had a royalty deal
for a second.

41:40.264 --> 41:41.899
I wanted to know what it felt
like after all these years.

41:41.899 --> 41:44.469
If you'd gone to a buck a reel,
he would have done the deal.

41:44.469 --> 41:46.170
Buck a reel
gets the deal.
