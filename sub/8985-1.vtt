00:58.000 --> 01:00.172
l'm Eliza Thornberry.

01:00.370 --> 01:02.159
Part of your average family.

01:02.353 --> 01:05.038
l've got a dad and a mom.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.057
And a sister.

01:07.251 --> 01:09.935
There's Donnie. We found him.

01:10.132 --> 01:12.980
And Darwin...he found us.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.163
We travel all over the world.

01:17.366 --> 01:22.004
See, my dad hosts this nature show,
and my mom shoots it.

01:22.200 --> 01:25.976
And along the way,
something amazing happened.

01:26.168 --> 01:28.591
l freed a warthog
who was really a shaman.

01:28.793 --> 01:31.063
Shaman Mnyambo.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.936
He granted me
the power to talk to animals.

01:35.131 --> 01:39.573
lt's really cool...but totally secret.

01:41.566 --> 01:46.935
And that was just the beginning
of my biggest adventure ever.

02:41.647 --> 02:48.294
And now, Phaedra the Magnificent
will walk the Circle of Destiny!

02:50.257 --> 02:52.908
Circle of Destiny, indeed!

02:54.866 --> 02:57.322
Phew! Eliza, your friend stinks.

02:57.523 --> 03:00.044
And those tusks
could poke an eye out.

03:00.244 --> 03:01.553
Darwin, chill.

03:01.748 --> 03:05.262
- Phaedra, take us around that tree.
- Sure.

03:05.462 --> 03:07.666
Here's how our moms make us go.

03:07.862 --> 03:10.962
They nudge the back of our necks
with their trunks.

03:11.159 --> 03:13.843
- Really? Like this?
- That's it!

03:14.040 --> 03:19.344
And if she wanted us to turn around,
she'd nudge one side.

03:20.154 --> 03:21.648
Oh, cool!

03:21.850 --> 03:24.633
Rub behind the ear and
the elephant turns. Fascinating!

03:24.827 --> 03:28.406
Eliza, can we go now?
My butt's gone to sleep.

03:28.604 --> 03:30.427
OK, Darwin.

03:30.621 --> 03:33.109
- Bye, Eliza.
- Bye, Phaedra.

03:33.310 --> 03:35.198
Bye...chimp!

03:36.702 --> 03:40.794
l think l hear your grandmumsy
opening a fresh tin of pudding.

03:40.992 --> 03:44.222
- Darwin, listen.
- To what? l don't hear a thing.

03:44.417 --> 03:47.963
That's what l mean. lt's too quiet.

03:48.833 --> 03:52.031
lt's a shame you couldn't spend
more time with us, Mumsy.

03:52.227 --> 03:54.399
Two weeks is more than enough.

03:54.595 --> 03:58.273
Your father gets a bit daft
when left on his own too long.

03:58.469 --> 04:02.365
He's probably searched the entire
estate for his reading glasses.

04:02.566 --> 04:05.567
Good thing l take after you,
eh, Mumsy?

04:05.766 --> 04:10.437
Marianne, have you had any luck
locating my binoculars?

04:10.632 --> 04:13.382
Try around your neck!

04:17.290 --> 04:18.697
Bad news!

04:18.891 --> 04:23.300
Jungle Boy used the teapot
to store his grub-worms.

04:27.565 --> 04:29.092
Dad! Mom! Stampede!

04:29.294 --> 04:31.334
Battle stations, everybody!

04:39.249 --> 04:42.566
Mumsy! Stand absolutely still!

04:42.769 --> 04:46.480
They're not carnivores.
The gazelle is quite harmless.

04:46.675 --> 04:49.675
Unless you happen to be
a tuft of grass!

04:54.517 --> 04:56.306
lt's Akela!

05:00.119 --> 05:02.989
- Does this sort of thing happen often?
- No.

05:03.191 --> 05:05.297
Thank goodness!

05:07.384 --> 05:11.793
Cordelia, l hate to leave you, but we
need to get some footage before dark.

05:11.994 --> 05:14.678
Yes, Mumsy.
Will you be all right here?

05:14.875 --> 05:19.284
Don't worry. The girls and l will have
a nice quiet evening together.

05:19.484 --> 05:21.973
See you later, then! Bye bye!

05:22.173 --> 05:26.582
Just when we get something cool
to drive, l have to be grounded!

05:26.782 --> 05:31.802
Certainly you're grounded.
You tied Donnie to a termite mound.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.887
Hey, he was happy.

05:35.617 --> 05:40.125
- Eliza, where are you going?
- Just going for a walk!

05:40.322 --> 05:42.427
Have we forgotten
about that cheetah?

05:42.627 --> 05:46.457
lt's OK, Grandmumsy,
l do it all the time.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.769
Deborah, does your sister...?

05:48.964 --> 05:52.446
Talk like a monkey,
dress like a geek? Yeah!

05:52.646 --> 05:55.036
Come on,
Akela's cubs must be nearby.

05:55.238 --> 05:59.429
Cheetah cubs? To them,
l'm a walking snack pack!

06:10.859 --> 06:14.121
- Hey, guys!
- lt's Eliza!

06:14.316 --> 06:17.612
Oh, you've grown so big.
Hey, where's Tally?

06:17.805 --> 06:21.734
Here l am! You should see me run.
l'm really fast now.

06:22.382 --> 06:26.344
Fast? As in ''able to outrun
defenceless chimps''?

06:30.193 --> 06:32.649
You guys remember Darwin.

06:32.849 --> 06:34.410
l've got an idea.

06:34.609 --> 06:37.294
- Let's have a race.
- Yeah! Me first.

06:37.490 --> 06:39.946
Children! lt's time for dinner.

06:40.148 --> 06:44.426
- Not me, l'm skin and bones.
- Mom, Eliza wants us to race.

06:44.629 --> 06:48.591
No, the plains are too dangerous
for little ones like you.

06:48.790 --> 06:52.436
But l'll be with them.
l'd never let anything happen.

06:52.631 --> 06:54.672
You can trust me.

06:54.871 --> 06:56.465
Please, Mom!

06:56.664 --> 06:58.487
All right, Eliza.

06:58.681 --> 07:02.741
But keep an eye on them.
And don't go beyond the acacia tree.

07:13.213 --> 07:15.221
Hey, slowpokes, l'm winning!

07:15.422 --> 07:18.489
Who are you calling slowpoke?

07:21.888 --> 07:24.888
Eliza, you've passed the acacia tree!

07:25.089 --> 07:26.813
Just barely!

07:27.009 --> 07:29.858
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

07:33.155 --> 07:34.562
Poachers!

07:38.692 --> 07:40.034
Run!

08:01.963 --> 08:03.818
Eliza!

08:10.445 --> 08:12.333
No!

08:43.575 --> 08:45.169
Eliza!

08:45.911 --> 08:48.051
Give him back!

08:50.521 --> 08:52.180
He's just a baby!

08:53.082 --> 08:56.117
Deborah, bring the Commvee
straight away!

08:56.315 --> 08:58.585
l wish l could, but l'm grounded!

08:58.780 --> 09:00.024
Debbie, now!

09:12.896 --> 09:15.101
Deborah, slow down immediately!

09:15.296 --> 09:17.785
Sorry, Grandmumsy. Dad's orders.

09:22.146 --> 09:24.961
Donnie, this is no time
for the wedgie dance!

09:25.155 --> 09:27.611
Will somebody do something?

09:27.812 --> 09:29.154
Somebody?

09:29.348 --> 09:32.666
We'll discuss your impertinence later,
young lady!

09:32.869 --> 09:35.237
Follow that helicopter!

09:37.318 --> 09:41.182
l couldn't have had a sister
who plays with dolls.

10:09.103 --> 10:12.138
Hello, Mumsy. Having a jolly holiday?

10:12.336 --> 10:15.654
Nigel, we must discuss
your children's manners.

10:15.858 --> 10:19.503
We're equally as proud,
but now's not the time.

10:31.766 --> 10:33.011
My baby!

10:55.613 --> 10:57.468
My baby.

11:09.730 --> 11:14.073
We can't just sit here.
We have to find those poachers.

11:14.275 --> 11:17.472
You were almost killed.
Let Jomo take care of them.

11:17.668 --> 11:21.313
- But, Mom, l have to save Tally.
- Who?

11:21.509 --> 11:23.397
That's what l call the cheetah cub.

11:23.590 --> 11:26.340
She names man-eating wild animals?

11:26.534 --> 11:29.601
Names 'em, plays with 'em,
talks in monkey to 'em!

11:29.799 --> 11:31.229
Debbie, enough!

11:31.431 --> 11:36.321
- Could you identify this man, Eliza?
- No. He shined a light in my eyes.

11:36.521 --> 11:40.745
But the handle of his knife was
carved in the shape of a falcon.

11:40.938 --> 11:42.465
That'll help, won't it?

11:42.667 --> 11:44.772
There are many knives,
many poachers.

11:44.972 --> 11:49.676
- But l have to find Tally.
- Eliza, you must leave this to us.

11:49.869 --> 11:54.628
Promise me, you will never go off
alone at night.

11:54.830 --> 11:56.074
l promise.

11:56.271 --> 12:00.429
Good girl.
Nigel, l will call if l hear anything.

12:00.624 --> 12:03.560
- Good night, all.
- Thank you, Jomo.

12:03.761 --> 12:07.145
Eliza! Don't go out
in the savannah at night.

12:07.346 --> 12:10.194
Yeah, right! She and the monkey
are always sneaking off!

12:10.387 --> 12:12.111
- What?
- Debbie!

12:12.308 --> 12:14.348
l've covered long enough.

12:14.548 --> 12:18.258
She once fed one of my protein bars
to a Komodo dragon!

12:18.453 --> 12:21.683
And in wherever-land,
she rode a Siberian tiger!

12:21.878 --> 12:25.873
And ask about the time she was
dancing with crazy dingoes!

12:26.071 --> 12:28.592
- What?
- That's not the half of it!

12:28.793 --> 12:31.281
- Eliza!
- Thanks, Deb!

12:31.481 --> 12:34.329
Nigel...l don't know what to do.

12:34.522 --> 12:39.739
Well, l do! Elizabeth has no regard
for her own safety.

12:39.931 --> 12:44.439
We have discussed this for years.
She needs a structured environment.

12:44.637 --> 12:48.467
One such as a boarding school
back in London!

12:48.670 --> 12:53.428
Hold on! She messes up and
gets to go to boarding school?

12:53.631 --> 12:56.021
Mumsy, that's rather drastic.

12:56.224 --> 13:00.154
Need l remind you, that it was
in the confines of boarding school

13:00.353 --> 13:04.216
that you received your education,
not here in the wild?

13:04.419 --> 13:10.017
You don't think it's civilised for a girl
to play with cheetahs and chimps?

13:10.212 --> 13:14.305
Hello! What about me?

13:14.501 --> 13:16.357
Do l look civilised?

13:16.550 --> 13:17.795
Frankly, no.

13:17.990 --> 13:21.057
But l'm afraid
it's much too late for you.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.710
Mom, Dad, l can't leave!

13:23.912 --> 13:27.972
Tally never would've been out
on the plains if it wasn't for me.

13:28.170 --> 13:30.953
- lt's all my fault.
- How?

13:31.146 --> 13:33.897
- l have to go back out there!
- No!

13:34.092 --> 13:37.027
We make these rules for a reason.

13:37.228 --> 13:40.807
lf l have to send you away
to be safe, l will.

13:41.005 --> 13:43.876
Dad? Please!

13:44.526 --> 13:47.244
Poppet, your intentions are noble,

13:47.439 --> 13:49.806
but you're just too young.

13:50.671 --> 13:52.843
l'm sorry.

14:00.979 --> 14:05.967
We agreed, when we took this job,
we wouldn't split up the family.

14:06.164 --> 14:08.947
We'd keep the children
with us on the road.

14:09.141 --> 14:11.531
l remember, dearest.

14:12.599 --> 14:15.949
Oh, Nigel.
Are we doing the right thing?

14:16.151 --> 14:20.887
You heard Eliza. She blames herself
for this unfortunate incident.

14:21.081 --> 14:24.213
She'll never stop
until she finds that cub.

14:24.410 --> 14:26.385
She's quite fearless, you know.

14:26.586 --> 14:29.435
She takes after her father.

14:35.837 --> 14:37.332
That poor girl.

14:40.510 --> 14:43.675
Boarding school? l never heard
of anything so ridiculous!

14:43.871 --> 14:46.458
Did anyone bother to ask my opinion?

14:47.104 --> 14:50.072
l wish l could tell them
l talk to animals.

14:50.273 --> 14:54.136
No! Then you'll lose your power,
and we'll never talk again!

14:54.339 --> 15:00.286
- How will l know what Debbie's saying?
- Calm down, l won't break the rule.

15:00.484 --> 15:03.168
Good.
Now, about this boarding school,

15:03.365 --> 15:05.732
l can't take gym class,

15:05.925 --> 15:10.531
because those tight shorts
show off my problem area.

15:11.367 --> 15:15.143
Dar...you can't come with me.

15:17.641 --> 15:20.064
Darwin, come back!

15:20.266 --> 15:24.774
- Whatever is the matter with Darwin?
- He saw me pack my suitcase.

15:24.972 --> 15:29.129
- l guess he figured out l'm leaving.
- Very intuitive, that chimp.

15:29.325 --> 15:31.976
l'm sorry about all this, Dad.

15:32.173 --> 15:35.436
l'm not sure l wouldn't have done
the same thing.

15:35.630 --> 15:39.374
ln fact, l went up against poachers
myself once,

15:39.568 --> 15:41.772
to save an elephant, remember?

15:41.968 --> 15:43.976
l remember.

15:44.177 --> 15:48.008
Come, let me show you
where we're headed next. The Congo.

15:48.210 --> 15:52.172
- To look for forest elephants?
- Yes. lf we can find any.

15:52.372 --> 15:58.069
There's an old, old Baaka legend,
that tells of a solar eclipse,

15:58.261 --> 16:03.762
when thousands of elephants
made their way to Tembo Valley.

16:03.958 --> 16:05.420
l wonder why.

16:05.623 --> 16:10.807
Nobody knows. But there's an eclipse
in a few weeks in this exact spot.

16:11.001 --> 16:14.482
And l intend to witness it first hand.

16:14.681 --> 16:17.584
l wish l could see it with you, Dad.

16:17.787 --> 16:24.183
Eliza, l received this medal
when l was in boarding school.

16:24.380 --> 16:27.348
Perhaps you'd like to take it, for luck.

16:27.549 --> 16:30.070
''Awarded for bravery.''

16:30.270 --> 16:33.981
Oh...it was nothing, really.

16:34.175 --> 16:38.519
A blazing building, twenty students
trapped, a makeshift rope ladder...

16:38.720 --> 16:40.095
Well, never mind.

16:40.289 --> 16:44.665
The point is you will have
your own challenges, Poppet,

16:44.866 --> 16:49.821
and l predict,
you will meet them splendidly.

16:53.893 --> 16:58.171
l looked everywhere for Darwin.
l didn't get to say goodbye.

16:58.375 --> 17:02.053
l'm sorry, honey.
You'll see him again soon.

17:02.247 --> 17:03.873
l love you.

17:04.071 --> 17:06.406
l'll miss you, Mom.

17:06.601 --> 17:08.511
You won't leave without him, Dad?

17:08.713 --> 17:11.396
Of course not, Poppet.

17:11.594 --> 17:15.457
Here's what you can get me
in London: CDs, boots, T-shirts.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.548
Basically, anything cool.

17:25.165 --> 17:28.036
Don't forget: ''cool''.

17:28.239 --> 17:31.109
Elizabeth! lt's time for take-off!

17:31.312 --> 17:34.662
Kiss your natural wilderness
girlhood goodbye!

17:53.430 --> 17:55.470
Bye, Dad.

19:31.026 --> 19:32.750
Look at that.

19:32.947 --> 19:35.282
ls that a new girl?

19:58.651 --> 19:59.895
Darwin!

20:00.091 --> 20:05.177
You didn't think l'd let you get civilised
without me, did you?

20:07.037 --> 20:11.064
- You can't be here!
- lt's a miracle l survived the hold!

20:11.262 --> 20:13.750
Your bags are not handled
with care.

20:13.951 --> 20:16.635
They don't allow chimps in school.

20:16.832 --> 20:19.832
They'll change their mind
when they meet me!

20:20.033 --> 20:23.263
Let's look at my new home.
Small yet charming.

20:23.458 --> 20:27.103
Not much natural light,
but we've had enough of nature.

20:27.299 --> 20:29.569
Dibs on this bed!

20:29.763 --> 20:32.764
Feel those springs, firm yet flexible.

20:32.965 --> 20:36.762
Could you lend me your cashmere
sweater for the dance?

20:36.966 --> 20:41.724
- Someone's coming.
- Room service? l like school already!

20:41.926 --> 20:44.164
Darwin, you can't be here!

20:46.024 --> 20:47.650
But why?

20:50.889 --> 20:54.207
- l'm a fast learner and...
- l can see your feet!

20:54.410 --> 20:56.265
Let me in!

20:57.547 --> 21:00.843
Are you still quibbling about
that 2% difference in our DNA?

21:01.036 --> 21:04.932
Just be quiet
until l figure out what to do.

21:05.870 --> 21:08.456
l'm Eliza Thornberry.
Guess we're room-mates.

21:08.655 --> 21:10.182
So it appears.

21:10.383 --> 21:12.685
l'm Sarah Wellington.

21:13.296 --> 21:15.020
Have you been romping
on my bed?

21:15.217 --> 21:18.284
Just trying out the springs.
Firm yet flexible.

21:18.481 --> 21:21.165
Perhaps we should
negotiate a few issues.

21:21.362 --> 21:24.298
You stay on your side
and l stay on mine.

21:24.499 --> 21:28.297
My things shall be off-limits
as they are antique and expensive.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.923
This perfume is French.

21:31.829 --> 21:34.547
And don't even dream
about wearing my clothes.

21:34.742 --> 21:37.710
No matter how tempting the urge.

21:37.911 --> 21:40.978
l see that you've already rooted
through my wardrobe.

21:41.176 --> 21:42.605
Sarah!

21:42.809 --> 21:45.362
Want one of my mom's
home-made cookies?

21:45.561 --> 21:48.245
l might have a use for you yet.

21:53.947 --> 21:56.763
lt's so great to talk to you guys.

21:56.957 --> 21:59.957
You have no idea how awful it's been.

22:00.158 --> 22:03.028
Go on, Eliza,
tell Reggie your troubles.

22:03.231 --> 22:06.679
l don't suppose you have any
of those cheesy snacks?

22:06.880 --> 22:09.270
Cheese Munchies? Right here.

22:09.472 --> 22:10.716
Brilliant!

22:10.913 --> 22:12.921
Now, what's the problem?

22:13.121 --> 22:15.642
l miss my friends in Africa.

22:15.842 --> 22:18.079
You should see it there, Reggie.

22:18.275 --> 22:20.926
l've even met some squirrels who fly.

22:21.124 --> 22:24.867
Fly? Like a bird?
Don't like the sound of that!

22:26.373 --> 22:30.466
l heard her family lives
in the jungle in a motor home!

22:30.662 --> 22:34.144
And she bathes where animals drink!

22:36.520 --> 22:40.034
Next she'll be bringing animals
into my room!

22:45.194 --> 22:50.531
- Eliza, can you hear me? lt's Mom!
- And your dear old Dad!

22:50.732 --> 22:55.720
- What did you say, honey?
- Has Jomo found Tally?

22:55.917 --> 22:58.187
Sorry, Poppet, no.

22:58.382 --> 23:01.644
ln fact, the poachers disappeared
without a trace.

23:01.839 --> 23:05.834
- Tell her about Darwin.
- l was leading up to that.

23:06.032 --> 23:09.416
Poodles, l'm afraid
we've lost track of Darwin.

23:09.617 --> 23:14.059
He'll be all right. He's probably
foraging for bugs right now!

23:14.259 --> 23:17.325
The shepherd's pie is heavenly.

23:17.524 --> 23:20.143
But why do they put
these green things in it?

23:20.341 --> 23:22.229
They look like bunny poop!

23:22.421 --> 23:27.344
- Honey, is someone there?
- Just my room-mate, Sarah.

23:27.543 --> 23:30.708
Mom, please don't forget
about Tally.

23:30.904 --> 23:34.166
We won't.
We told Jomo where we're headed.

23:34.361 --> 23:36.598
Try to have fun with your new friends.

23:36.793 --> 23:39.925
She's making friends?
Give me that!

23:40.123 --> 23:42.676
Hi. Here's what's going on
with my life.

23:42.875 --> 23:45.909
Donnie's now half-goat,
my hair is half-terrier,

23:46.108 --> 23:51.063
and we're heading into the abyss
where there's no teen interaction! Bye!

23:51.261 --> 23:52.855
Oh, Debbie!

23:53.054 --> 23:55.925
Debbie? Mom? Dad?

23:56.479 --> 23:58.170
Donnie?

24:10.115 --> 24:15.746
We're all a bit curious.
Have you ever seen a tiger up close?

24:15.941 --> 24:19.008
- Close enough to pet.
- Oh, really?

24:19.205 --> 24:21.792
Tigers, bears, Komodo dragons...

24:21.990 --> 24:26.913
Once, we were in the Arctic
and l hung out with this polar bear.

24:27.112 --> 24:29.633
Seems my room-mate
is making friends.

24:29.833 --> 24:31.808
My friends!

24:33.066 --> 24:37.507
- They're really gentle...
- Sarah, Eliza swam with whales.

24:37.707 --> 24:42.247
- lsn't that lovely?
- Tell us more, Eliza.

24:59.441 --> 25:00.685
Darwin!

25:00.882 --> 25:03.217
l know! Don't l look fetching?

25:06.163 --> 25:10.736
Where was l? Swimming
with dingoes...l mean dolphins...

25:10.933 --> 25:14.960
Enough about me.
Anybody try the boiled cabbage?

25:15.158 --> 25:18.901
l'm going back for seconds.
Anyone else?

25:19.095 --> 25:22.958
- Who's that girl?
- Never seen her before.

25:23.160 --> 25:26.544
- ls she Eliza's friend?
- That's my monogram!

25:26.745 --> 25:30.194
Who are you and
why are you wearing my new blazer?

25:30.394 --> 25:33.079
There's an ape in my uniform!

25:33.275 --> 25:36.310
Give it back! Give it back!

25:36.508 --> 25:40.251
- Did it escape from the zoo?
- Darwin, no!

25:45.759 --> 25:48.542
Food fight, everyone!

25:56.545 --> 25:58.368
Come back!

26:00.739 --> 26:04.089
Girls! Girls! Food is for eating!

26:04.292 --> 26:05.983
Food is for...

26:15.015 --> 26:18.180
This is the best meal we've ever had!

26:25.482 --> 26:29.226
Miss Thornberry, your grandmother
will hear of this in the morning.

26:29.419 --> 26:34.342
And when we revive her, l'm sure
she'll be gravely disappointed.

26:34.541 --> 26:37.259
Now, say goodbye to your pet...

26:37.454 --> 26:39.047
...and come along!

26:39.822 --> 26:44.166
Eliza, don't leave me in this place,
l'll never last the night!

26:44.368 --> 26:47.816
No offence. l'm sure you're very nice.
''Thunder'', is it?

26:48.017 --> 26:52.393
- How horsy!
- l'll come see you in the morning, Dar.

26:52.594 --> 26:57.068
Trot along, lassie.
Your friend will be fine with me.

26:57.267 --> 26:58.544
Thanks, Thunder.

26:58.740 --> 27:01.741
Miss Thornberry? Come along!

27:14.009 --> 27:16.049
l need a hot bath and a good meal.

27:16.249 --> 27:19.992
You're in luck. They'll be bringing
the hay round any minute.

27:20.186 --> 27:25.272
- l'm to eat hay?
- Aye, and sweet crunchy oats, too.

27:25.468 --> 27:28.403
Oh, that changes everything.

27:29.981 --> 27:33.779
l'm beginning to see
why they call you Thunder.

27:34.814 --> 27:39.572
- Never mind. Where's the bathroom?
- You're standing on it!

27:43.329 --> 27:46.177
Did Mrs Fairgood make him
go to the zoo?

27:46.369 --> 27:50.843
- Where did he sleep?
- How did you smuggle him?

27:51.043 --> 27:53.946
Darwin decided...
l mean, it was easy.

27:54.147 --> 27:56.832
Hiding him from Sarah,
that's a different story.

27:57.028 --> 28:00.226
Miss Sarah Wellington thinks
she's the bee's knees!

28:00.421 --> 28:04.067
Why would you ever come here,
where it's so boring?

28:04.262 --> 28:09.349
l got into trouble. l snuck out...
There were poachers hunting...

28:09.544 --> 28:12.229
- Poachers?
- With guns?

28:12.425 --> 28:14.182
Go on, Eliza.

28:14.825 --> 28:19.780
There were three cheetah cubs
l knew. Like kittens, only wild.

28:19.979 --> 28:23.144
We were running
when we heard shots.

28:23.340 --> 28:26.570
A man dropped from a helicopter
on a ladder and...

28:26.765 --> 28:28.740
...grabbed the one l named Tally.

28:28.942 --> 28:33.613
l tried to save him,
but they cut the ladder and...l fell.

28:33.808 --> 28:35.564
Tally was gone.

28:35.760 --> 28:37.582
Poor Tally.

28:37.776 --> 28:41.094
l think he's alive. l just feel it.

28:41.298 --> 28:44.681
This is terrible!
Can't we write letters or something?

28:44.883 --> 28:48.462
- Let's have a bake sale!
- Let us help!

28:48.660 --> 28:50.286
Thanks, but...

28:50.484 --> 28:52.721
What's going on in my room?

28:52.917 --> 28:56.846
Sarah, Eliza was just telling us
the most awful story

28:57.046 --> 28:59.730
about...Tally.

28:59.927 --> 29:02.000
Never mind.

29:02.199 --> 29:05.462
l've been filling out a report
and am quite tired.

29:05.657 --> 29:08.854
- You'll all have to go.
- Goodnight, Eliza.

29:09.049 --> 29:10.424
Goodnight, Sarah.

29:10.618 --> 29:12.855
'Night, you guys!

29:16.508 --> 29:21.266
l still can't believe you harboured
a wild animal in my room...

29:22.269 --> 29:24.790
There are peas in my bed!

29:47.524 --> 29:50.111
Tally? Tally!

29:50.309 --> 29:54.085
Tally! l knew you were alive.

29:56.231 --> 29:59.461
Eliza, help me!

29:59.656 --> 30:01.151
Tally?

30:02.153 --> 30:03.976
Tally!

30:12.683 --> 30:16.165
l gave you this gift
for a reason, Eliza.

30:16.365 --> 30:19.050
Shaman Mnyambo?

30:19.246 --> 30:21.254
You must not waste time.

30:21.455 --> 30:25.733
You must go to your destiny. Go!

30:25.936 --> 30:29.319
What do you mean?
Where am l supposed to go?

30:29.520 --> 30:31.015
Shaman?

30:31.218 --> 30:35.180
Tally is alive. Go save him, Eliza.

30:35.378 --> 30:37.550
Go! Go!

30:42.804 --> 30:45.194
Shaman Mnyambo's right.

30:45.397 --> 30:47.285
l have to go.

30:54.327 --> 30:56.238
What are you doing?

30:56.441 --> 30:58.580
l have to leave.

30:58.777 --> 31:04.343
- l'm calling Mrs Fairgood.
- No! You have to keep this a secret.

31:04.538 --> 31:07.922
Do you have a credit card
for tickets to Africa?

31:08.123 --> 31:11.190
- l won't do this.
- My parents will pay you back.

31:11.389 --> 31:15.132
- No one will know until it's all over.
- What's over?

31:15.326 --> 31:18.589
You're acting so odd.
l'm reporting you at once.

31:18.783 --> 31:21.981
Sarah, please, it's a matter
of life and death.

31:22.176 --> 31:26.487
l have to go now
and l really need your help. Please!

31:26.689 --> 31:30.487
Just think, you'll get the room
all to yourself again.

31:33.027 --> 31:34.937
Would you prefer aisle or window?

31:37.348 --> 31:39.323
Darwin, wake up!

31:39.525 --> 31:41.052
What?

31:41.254 --> 31:45.216
l've tried to keep track of the days,
but they've blurred into months!

31:45.415 --> 31:48.133
Dar, it's only been four hours.

32:24.850 --> 32:28.560
lt's certainly better than riding
in the hold, but l don't understand...

32:28.755 --> 32:32.880
Shh! l'll tell you
after the plane takes off.

32:33.077 --> 32:34.484
Fine!

32:34.677 --> 32:36.750
Shh! Stop fidgeting!

32:36.950 --> 32:39.918
l can't help it, l've got hay in my skirt.

32:43.896 --> 32:45.904
She has that hairy disease.

32:46.104 --> 32:49.902
We're going to see
a special doctor in Nairobi.

33:53.260 --> 33:55.781
l'll find you, Tally.

33:57.293 --> 33:58.853
l promise.

34:33.751 --> 34:39.023
We'll be gone until after the eclipse.
Will you be all right with Donnie?

34:40.025 --> 34:43.158
This will be the highlight
of my young life!

34:43.353 --> 34:45.395
That's the spirit, Poodles!

34:45.594 --> 34:50.418
Dad, have you completely lost
your ability to recognise sarcasm?

34:50.620 --> 34:52.726
l'm not sure l ever had it.

34:52.925 --> 34:58.328
Stay close to camp. lf you're lucky,
you might see a hyena roving about!

34:58.527 --> 35:01.724
Excuse me, while l go find
a container for my joy.

35:01.920 --> 35:04.768
Very well, we'll wait right here.

35:04.960 --> 35:08.157
Oh...that's sarcasm, isn't it?

35:08.353 --> 35:11.453
You do that rather frequently,
don't you?

35:11.650 --> 35:15.645
Debbie, just how long
is this sulking going to go on?

35:15.843 --> 35:19.140
Another 35-40 minutes.
Then l'll start up again tomorrow.

35:19.332 --> 35:22.432
Get some rest.
l know it must be draining.

35:22.630 --> 35:26.111
We'll call you on the short wave.

35:26.311 --> 35:29.345
Be careful. And have a good time!

35:29.543 --> 35:32.512
No problem.
l'll take the Congo-Com for a spin.

35:32.712 --> 35:34.306
Absolutely not!

35:34.505 --> 35:36.742
But do have fun!

35:46.124 --> 35:48.580
That is so wrong.

35:52.942 --> 35:56.969
Help! The poachers...
l've been shot!

36:00.720 --> 36:03.820
- Darwin, get up.
- What?

36:05.426 --> 36:07.434
Excuse me...

36:12.852 --> 36:17.392
A rhino's been shot.
You have to let me off this train!

36:36.987 --> 36:40.600
Hang on, we'll get help.
You'll be OK.

36:40.796 --> 36:44.594
They shot me...at the river.

36:44.797 --> 36:47.416
They were trying to take my horn,

36:47.614 --> 36:50.070
when l ran away.

36:53.823 --> 36:56.126
Help! Help!

36:57.153 --> 37:00.831
Please help me!
This rhino's been shot!

37:01.026 --> 37:04.322
- Hold this, right here.
- ls he still alive?

37:04.515 --> 37:06.687
Barely. But l think l can save him.

37:06.884 --> 37:11.642
You're a very brave young lady.
We saw you jump from that train.

37:11.845 --> 37:14.563
l had to save this rhino...

37:15.590 --> 37:19.268
That's the knife from the man
who took Tally.

37:19.463 --> 37:22.944
- Keep applying pressure.
- Sorry, l just...

37:23.144 --> 37:28.513
- Thank goodness, the authorities.
- What happened here?

37:28.714 --> 37:31.976
Poachers shot him at the river.
Find them.

37:32.171 --> 37:34.311
They took a cheetah cub.

37:34.508 --> 37:37.608
l recognised their knife.
Call Jomo Mbelie!

37:37.804 --> 37:41.515
- You know Jomo?
- Yes, he's friends with my father.

37:41.710 --> 37:44.166
Tell him Eliza found the knife.

37:44.366 --> 37:47.236
We were just at the river,
there were no poachers.

37:47.440 --> 37:52.362
l'm Sloan Blackburn. We're studying
the endangered wildlife.

37:53.489 --> 37:56.938
We have to get this poor guy
to our camp.

37:57.138 --> 38:00.139
My wife, Bree.
She's a wildlife veterinarian.

38:00.339 --> 38:03.023
We'll take him to the rhino sanctuary.

38:10.518 --> 38:13.835
Eliza, they'll take care of him,
don't worry.

38:15.703 --> 38:19.479
Can we give you a lift? You shouldn't
be alone with poachers around.

38:19.673 --> 38:22.129
No, thanks. Our camp's not too far.

38:22.329 --> 38:26.324
We have to get back to our work,
but l hope we see you again.

38:26.522 --> 38:28.311
Me, too.

38:28.507 --> 38:31.028
Thanks for your help. Bye!

38:32.765 --> 38:35.351
Come on.
We have to find those poachers.

38:35.550 --> 38:40.057
We have to find your parents.
You saw what those poachers did.

38:40.255 --> 38:43.158
- But if they're nearby, Tally is, too.
- No!

38:43.359 --> 38:47.583
lf those awful people see you again,
they'll hurt you.

38:47.777 --> 38:51.073
And l'm not going to let that happen.

38:51.266 --> 38:55.577
You're right, Darwin.
We can't do this alone.

38:56.836 --> 38:59.106
Hurry, we'll find my parents' camp.

38:59.300 --> 39:01.276
lt's not far, is it?

39:01.477 --> 39:04.325
We'll get there...by morning.

39:05.574 --> 39:11.489
l wish we'd never left school.
Thunder said there'd be days like this.

39:21.162 --> 39:26.085
This dude Jack plants these
magic beans, 'cause he's hungry.

39:26.284 --> 39:31.141
Then, a mondo beanstalk
grows way up into the clouds.

39:34.798 --> 39:37.384
Bushbabies! How annoying!

39:37.583 --> 39:40.431
Jack, who's totally buff,
climbs up the beanstalk

39:40.624 --> 39:45.197
and finds a golden goose,
a golden harp and a big, scary...

39:47.474 --> 39:48.904
...giant?

39:51.475 --> 39:52.882
Donnie?

39:54.164 --> 39:55.855
Donnie!

39:56.917 --> 39:59.635
Donnie! Donnie!

40:09.113 --> 40:12.627
Radcliffe! You never told me
how to land!

40:12.825 --> 40:16.405
- Grandmumsy?
- lt's all in the knees, Cordy!

40:16.602 --> 40:19.832
- Colonel?
- You're looking well, Deborah!

40:21.949 --> 40:24.633
Do we have a kiss for Grandpapa?

40:30.398 --> 40:33.366
l knew l shouldn't have brought
the good china!

40:33.568 --> 40:38.785
Debbie, dreadful news.
Your sister has run away from school.

40:38.977 --> 40:42.557
Under cover of night...with Darwin!

40:42.754 --> 40:47.098
Excuse me, did you say
the monkey got to go to London?

40:47.299 --> 40:49.275
Debbie, are you there? Over.

40:49.476 --> 40:52.860
- Guess who's here?
- Don't alarm your parents.

40:53.061 --> 40:57.023
She means there's no need
for Marianne to blame her

40:57.223 --> 40:59.842
a minute earlier than necessary!

41:00.039 --> 41:01.414
Sorry.

41:01.608 --> 41:06.181
Eliza was seen boarding a train
for the Congo. We'll take her back.

41:06.376 --> 41:09.061
Debbie! Who's there?

41:09.257 --> 41:11.429
Some cute bushbabies!

41:11.627 --> 41:14.857
Did l just hear you call
a wild animal ''cute''?

41:15.052 --> 41:19.079
That's called sarcasm, dearest.

41:24.846 --> 41:29.582
Sure, you can ride with us.
My owner will never know.

41:45.716 --> 41:49.514
How did l end up here...
amongst chickens?

42:02.970 --> 42:07.510
Donnie, this may look like
a shark cage, but it's a playpen.

42:07.707 --> 42:12.497
lt's where nice little boys play, when
their sisters want peace and quiet.

42:16.957 --> 42:19.129
Hey, Donnie!

42:19.774 --> 42:24.183
lf it isn't the boarding school dropout
and her sidekick, Chimp-o!

42:24.383 --> 42:27.832
- l need to talk to Mom and Dad.
- They're not here.

42:28.033 --> 42:30.302
Talk to me and pretend l'm listening.

42:30.497 --> 42:33.083
- Where are they?
- ln the jungle, filming.

42:33.282 --> 42:36.447
- But the eclipse isn't until tomorrow.
- Whatever.

42:36.643 --> 42:39.294
Fine. l'll call them on the radio.

42:39.492 --> 42:42.275
Don't go in there.

42:44.389 --> 42:49.060
- What are they doing here?
- Taking you back to England.

42:49.255 --> 42:53.795
l'm not going back.
l came back to find Tally.

42:53.992 --> 42:57.222
- l just need Dad's help.
- What's wrong with you?

42:57.417 --> 43:00.232
You finally get a chance
to escape our jail,

43:00.426 --> 43:03.722
instead you come back
like some freaky homing pigeon,

43:03.915 --> 43:07.299
and wreck my chance
of ever getting out of this place.

43:07.500 --> 43:11.625
l am not going to slow dance
at my prom with some baboon!

43:12.305 --> 43:18.282
