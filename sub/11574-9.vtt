WEBVTT

00:09.093 --> 00:11.835
I am so jealous of my feet.

00:20.313 --> 00:23.305
I had these puppies on
layaway for three months.

00:24.984 --> 00:26.440
Uh huh.

00:28.571 --> 00:30.903
Restraint!

00:30.990 --> 00:33.527
Yay, Kenzi!

00:33.618 --> 00:34.983
Super yay.

00:35.077 --> 00:37.454
Of course, if I was you,

00:37.538 --> 00:40.325
I would've just succubus-ed
the face off fifty shoe clerks

00:40.416 --> 00:43.829
and marched these babies right home.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.160
Good thing you're not me.

00:45.254 --> 00:46.494
Yeah, that's right nerdling.

00:46.589 --> 00:48.705
--Hey!
--Yoink.

00:48.799 --> 00:51.586
Life Not Love: Learning
to Like Yourself Alone?

00:51.677 --> 00:53.383
Dude, no!

00:53.471 --> 00:55.211
This is how it all starts.

00:55.306 --> 00:58.639
Hey, there is nothing wrong
with a little T.L.C. for the soul.

00:58.726 --> 01:02.093
Whoa! You did not just
use T.L.C. in a sentence.

01:02.188 --> 01:04.474
We are going out.

01:04.565 --> 01:08.683
A, we cannot deny the world a chance
to witness my stems in these kicks.

01:08.778 --> 01:10.063
Oh, you're such a giver.

01:10.154 --> 01:15.444
And b, we have been working so hard.

01:15.534 --> 01:19.118
You got up at noon and
then took a two o'clock nap.

01:19.205 --> 01:21.821
It could be my, my, my birthday,

01:21.916 --> 01:25.124
Christmas, Passover gift
all rolled into one.

01:25.211 --> 01:26.747
Please?

01:28.130 --> 01:31.042
Bo, we need this.

01:31.133 --> 01:35.126
The idea of running
into Dyson with Ciara,

01:35.221 --> 01:38.213
it's like the bar is
suddenly enemy territory.

01:38.307 --> 01:41.265
No. It is our bar.

01:41.352 --> 01:45.721
That is why you can't give up so easy.

01:45.815 --> 01:50.559
Though tonight, you like
to party among the hostiles...

01:50.653 --> 01:53.941
...in disguise. Sexy biker chick.

01:54.031 --> 01:55.567
Go as someone else?

01:55.658 --> 01:59.025
Preferably a girl
who would recycle this.

02:01.831 --> 02:03.367
What the hell.

02:08.713 --> 02:11.125
What the hells?

02:11.215 --> 02:14.833
Well, I guess Bingo Night's
turned out to be a real hoot.

02:16.137 --> 02:18.844
Oh, come on!

02:23.060 --> 02:24.641
--Act cool.
--Wow.

02:24.729 --> 02:26.060
What's with the new look?

02:26.147 --> 02:28.229
And the "You gotta pay for this" vibe?

02:28.316 --> 02:31.274
Not that I don't love it.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.523
Nice kicks, Kenz. Dyson, we're up.

02:36.782 --> 02:39.398
At least the worst part is behind us.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.949
You could say that.

02:41.037 --> 02:43.449
Bo?

02:43.539 --> 02:45.154
Lauren.

02:45.249 --> 02:48.286
Stay strong. I'll get us a pitcher.

02:48.377 --> 02:49.833
Each.

03:14.195 --> 03:17.107
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

03:17.198 --> 03:20.110
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

03:20.201 --> 03:23.113
My love carries a death sentence.

03:23.204 --> 03:25.286
l was lost for years,

03:25.373 --> 03:28.035
searching, while hiding,

03:28.125 --> 03:32.289
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:32.380 --> 03:37.249
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:42.890 --> 03:46.053
|, uh, I can't believe you're here.

03:46.143 --> 03:49.055
I can't believe how good you look.

03:49.146 --> 03:52.684
Sorry. Sometimes my...

03:52.775 --> 03:54.060
...words and my thoughts don't--

03:54.151 --> 03:56.142
Yeah.

03:56.237 --> 03:58.228
It's nice you got a
hall pass for Bingo Night.

03:58.322 --> 04:01.155
Yeah. What's that about?

04:01.242 --> 04:04.734
Anyway, I can't stay for it.
I'm here on official Ash business.

04:04.829 --> 04:07.912
Well, least that's what I told Lachlan.

04:07.998 --> 04:10.330
The ol' "your mouth says one
thing, your lips say another."

04:10.418 --> 04:12.659
Or kiss another, as the case may be.

04:12.753 --> 04:13.412
Sorry.

04:13.462 --> 04:15.999
No, it's okay. It was just...

04:16.090 --> 04:20.584
It was weird, you kissing
me in front of Nadia.

04:20.678 --> 04:24.512
No, I mean, sorry,
I need to talk to Trick.

04:29.186 --> 04:32.474
And I need to murder Kenzi.

04:36.944 --> 04:40.436
None of these books
had what I was looking for.

04:40.531 --> 04:41.896
Did you try Wikipedia?

04:41.991 --> 04:43.231
You think this is funny?

04:43.325 --> 04:46.317
No. I think you look
like you needed a joke.

04:46.412 --> 04:47.743
Maybe a beer.

04:47.830 --> 04:50.321
What I need is information on
the darkest of the dark shaman

04:50.416 --> 04:52.748
so that I can figure
out who cursed Nadia.

04:52.835 --> 04:55.668
|'m scrounging up as
much research as I can.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.541
But witch doctors are dangerous.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.542
You should tread lightly.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.090
Yeah, I've tread lightly
for the past five years.

05:02.178 --> 05:03.839
Now I'm serving a man like Lachlan.

05:03.929 --> 05:06.090
Lauren.

05:06.182 --> 05:07.718
Sorry.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.800
I haven't been sleeping much.

05:10.895 --> 05:12.226
Tell me about it.

05:12.313 --> 05:15.476
With all the recent fighting
alienating all my clientele,

05:15.566 --> 05:17.773
I thought a bingo night would be fun.

05:17.860 --> 05:21.148
Clearly, I chose the wrong kind of fun.

05:21.238 --> 05:25.823
Two words, Trick--mechanical bull.

05:29.163 --> 05:30.619
Incoming.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.619
So.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.872
So.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.500
So, let's bench it.

05:40.591 --> 05:41.296
What?

05:41.342 --> 05:44.004
The awkward history.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.630
Maybe we should try being friends.

05:45.721 --> 05:49.930
I mean, really, real friends.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.679
What's in this?

05:55.397 --> 05:58.309
It's me in this.

05:58.400 --> 06:03.520
Dressing like someone else makes
me realize how good change can be.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.946
|-| agree.

06:06.033 --> 06:10.447
And I think it's lovely that Detective
Hale has changed into your ex-girlfriend.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.280
So, is this what you meant by
"having a drink with the boys"?

06:13.374 --> 06:15.456
'Cause I think we might
have a different meaning

06:15.543 --> 06:17.579
for that phrase across the pond.

06:17.670 --> 06:18.750
Okay then.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.964
Sorry, Bo. You've just uh...

06:21.048 --> 06:23.664
...stepped into an argument that
was cut short, what, an hour ago?

06:23.759 --> 06:26.501
Ciara, why don't we just
go for a walk, please?

06:26.595 --> 06:30.804
You see, I feel as though I started
reading this wonderful novel,

06:30.891 --> 06:33.678
but the middle section's been
ripped out and everyone around me's

06:33.769 --> 06:35.600
had the luxury of reading
those missing pages,

06:35.688 --> 06:37.349
but nobody will tell
me what happened.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.145
It's because there's
nothing important to tell.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.440
Wait. What?

06:41.527 --> 06:43.438
Give me back my friendship beer.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.690
If there's nothing important then

06:45.781 --> 06:47.897
why did you clam up when | asked
about her in that photograph?

06:47.992 --> 06:50.904
And why does everybody
hold their breath

06:50.995 --> 06:54.579
and stare every time you
and l are in the same room?

06:54.665 --> 06:56.155
I didn't mean nothing.

06:56.250 --> 07:00.994
| just mean I can't talk about it.
I don't want to talk about it.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.295
--What did you do to him?
--Excuse me?

07:03.382 --> 07:05.668
Your attention please.

07:07.428 --> 07:10.261
Y'all having a good time?

07:10.347 --> 07:11.757
Excellent.

07:11.849 --> 07:14.135
Because nobody's leaving.

07:14.226 --> 07:15.636
Who are you?

07:17.354 --> 07:19.686
Name's Woods.

07:19.773 --> 07:23.561
|'m tracking an escaped mental
patient, calls hisself Reynard.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.688
--The Reynard?
--That's right.

07:25.779 --> 07:29.146
--[DYSON] The Dark let him escape?
--Uh huh.

07:29.241 --> 07:33.610
And in honour of this
terribly embarrassing occasion,

07:33.704 --> 07:36.446
l'm throwing myself a little shindig.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.623
See if I can't round me
up some sociopath.

07:39.710 --> 07:43.248
And all of y'all fine folks is invited.

07:43.339 --> 07:45.921
It's not likely, my friend.

07:46.008 --> 07:48.044
You see this?

07:48.135 --> 07:51.627
Oh, well, I'll raise you this.

07:55.476 --> 07:57.762
Stop! This is a place of sanctuary!

07:57.853 --> 07:59.639
What the hell was that?

08:01.899 --> 08:05.562
Well, now let's just call it a warning.

08:05.653 --> 08:10.067
And a taste of what I've wrapped
around this entire establishment.

08:10.157 --> 08:14.025
Whoever tries to leave here
before I get what I came for

08:14.119 --> 08:18.408
does so with a blatant disregard
for their own well-being.

08:20.250 --> 08:24.744
And, potentially, their own life.

08:24.838 --> 08:29.298
The man I'm looking for is
somewhere on these premises

08:29.385 --> 08:30.921
and I aim to find him.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.798
If that lunatic is here,
we should evacuate the bar.

08:33.889 --> 08:37.381
Why are you confining
my innocent patrons?

08:37.476 --> 08:42.140
Because Reynard could
be hiding in one of them.

08:46.068 --> 08:50.027
And I let you talk me
into coming out tonight.

08:50.114 --> 08:51.570
Great.

08:53.075 --> 08:55.908
Placing a containment
field around the entire bar,

08:55.994 --> 08:58.076
it's a bit excessive, don't you think?

08:58.163 --> 09:01.701
Reynard escaped from a maximum
security Dark Fae facility.

09:01.792 --> 09:04.249
Would you rather I
string up a velvet rope?

09:04.336 --> 09:07.544
The Dark have no authority here.
This is neutral territory.

09:07.631 --> 09:10.043
There are exceptions
to the rules, old-timer.

09:10.134 --> 09:14.594
Namely 84B of the Fae Code, regarding
imminent risk to the public safety.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.422
Reynard is a demented anarchist, Trick.

09:17.516 --> 09:20.258
I know who he is.
I attended his murder trial.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.638
Then you know how
dangerous he can be.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.140
I can't believe you're supporting this.

09:24.231 --> 09:28.270
I am tolerating this, for now.

09:30.320 --> 09:34.063
Reynard was under the care
of one heck of a psychiatrist.

09:34.158 --> 09:38.527
During the treatments, she used to
inject her patients with her own blood.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.362
She could literally
get under their skin,

09:41.457 --> 09:44.324
enter their bodies and
feel their emotions.

09:44.418 --> 09:47.080
--A Gorgon.
--Uh huh.

09:47.171 --> 09:51.585
And before he escaped, this
wingnut Reynard strangled her,

09:51.675 --> 09:54.667
used one of her syringes
to steal some of her blood.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.253
What do you think he's
planning to do with it?

09:57.347 --> 09:59.429
What he always does.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.552
Cause chaos.

10:14.323 --> 10:15.779
He's alive.

10:17.034 --> 10:18.774
What happened to him?

10:29.671 --> 10:31.627
We've confirmed it.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.797
Reynard's poisoned the kegs.

10:33.884 --> 10:39.504
Anyone who's had some beer tonight
has ingested the Gorgon blood.

10:39.598 --> 10:40.678
Could be worse.

10:40.766 --> 10:43.178
Could've ingested
Trick's Creme de Squid.

10:43.268 --> 10:44.849
That is not a thing.

10:44.937 --> 10:46.643
So, all of us?

10:46.730 --> 10:47.719
Except for me.

10:47.815 --> 10:50.397
I wouldn't be caught
dead drinking that swill.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.941
Sorry. Barkeep humour.

10:54.029 --> 10:54.814
Cute.

10:54.863 --> 10:58.572
And since Reynard's body's
catatonic, it's probable

10:58.659 --> 11:04.450
he also ingested the blood, allowing him
to transport into someone else's skin.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.246
--Whose?
--Well, it shouldn't be hard for us

11:06.333 --> 11:07.994
to find the imposter.

11:08.085 --> 11:09.495
We all know each other well.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.749
Actually, I wouldn't say
I know any of you very well.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.506
Hi. I'm Bo.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.710
I haven't picked a side, yada yada yada,

11:19.805 --> 11:22.012
therefore, I'm not
playing this little game.

11:22.099 --> 11:23.214
I'm leaving.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.264
That's impossible, I'm afraid.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.013
I also have to go. I've only
been given two hours

11:27.104 --> 11:28.560
away from the Ash's compound.

11:28.647 --> 11:32.481
Hey, guys. How would I know
if a dude was inside of me?

11:32.568 --> 11:34.149
Been awhile?

11:34.236 --> 11:36.397
Reynard's not sharing a body.

11:36.488 --> 11:37.443
He's taken it over.

11:37.531 --> 11:40.489
Then where does the essence
from the original body go?

11:42.327 --> 11:44.818
Somewhere into the ether.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.500
What was that?

11:56.800 --> 11:58.540
Who are you?

12:00.512 --> 12:03.299
[NAIN ROUGE] I'm pleased we're
finally able to meet like this.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.257
Alone. To talk.

12:06.351 --> 12:09.184
I'm not much for chit-chat.

12:11.315 --> 12:12.600
You?

12:12.691 --> 12:15.558
Welcome to Hamistagan.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.188
English, please.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.941
Welcome to limbo.

12:21.867 --> 12:25.826
Look for uncharacteristic
behaviour in one another.

12:25.913 --> 12:29.405
Reynard's an excellent mimic,
but he can't fool all of y'all.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.330
Fine. Let's do this systematically.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.033
Perhaps we could start
by looking at Dyson.

12:33.128 --> 12:36.040
Hasn't really been himself
lately, or maybe he has.

12:36.131 --> 12:37.837
Not sure if I'd know.

12:37.925 --> 12:41.383
I bet you'd rather be anyone
but you right now, hey D-Man?

12:41.470 --> 12:44.712
--Stop it. This is serious.
--[HALE] Seriously bad timing.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.842
We're trapped in a bar, maybe for days,

12:46.934 --> 12:48.640
and this is the night
the new waitress has off?

12:48.727 --> 12:50.638
Enough!

12:50.729 --> 12:52.640
Is everybody paying attention?

12:52.731 --> 12:55.268
Because Reynard is
certainly paying attention.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.270
He's learning and plotting.

12:57.361 --> 13:00.068
If you knew what he was
capable of, you'd be begging me

13:00.155 --> 13:04.148
to find who Reynard is hiding in
and extinguish the threat.

13:04.242 --> 13:06.028
Extinguish?

13:08.580 --> 13:12.368
Dude needs to take a chill pill.
Drink a brewski.

13:19.925 --> 13:22.132
Spill it, demon seed.

13:22.219 --> 13:25.302
There's got to be more to you
than just my personal stalker.

13:25.389 --> 13:26.925
I am the Nain Rouge.

13:27.015 --> 13:29.848
I am compelled to witness
important events in time.

13:29.935 --> 13:31.345
Like a mini paparazzo?

13:31.436 --> 13:36.055
Your beloved humans have a less
sophisticated take on my existence.

13:36.149 --> 13:39.061
They call me the harbinger of doom.

13:40.195 --> 13:41.981
A messenger of disaster.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.688
Thanks for dumbing it down.

13:44.783 --> 13:49.493
So, why are you always
lurking around... me?

13:49.579 --> 13:52.616
You are... significant.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.198
Oh, boy. Here we go again.

13:54.292 --> 13:57.034
The extinction of the Fae is upon us.

13:57.129 --> 13:58.209
Extinction?

13:58.296 --> 14:01.129
I'm sorry. Do I need
to use smaller words?

14:01.216 --> 14:03.753
Fae go bye-bye.

14:03.844 --> 14:07.336
You know, you're awfully
patronizing for a half pint.

14:07.431 --> 14:10.298
I understand you,
I just don't believe you.

14:10.392 --> 14:11.848
It is to be.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.677
Unless you, Isabeau,
fulfill your destiny.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.602
See, I don't do destiny.

14:16.690 --> 14:20.057
Just like I don't do picking sides.
And my name is not Isabeau.

14:20.152 --> 14:21.938
See for yourself.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.814
What have you done?

14:38.378 --> 14:40.414
Now you've seen your fate.

14:46.928 --> 14:48.088
So, you're friends?

14:48.180 --> 14:49.920
--Yeah.
--Kind of.

14:50.015 --> 14:51.551
Kind of?

14:51.641 --> 14:52.892
It's complicated.

14:52.976 --> 14:55.934
I'm an all-powerful Siren,
you're a lightweight.

14:56.021 --> 14:58.478
I'm wicked. You're a wang.

14:58.565 --> 15:02.729
I'm playing it cool. I don't want
the bounty hunter to know about us

15:02.819 --> 15:03.899
About us what?

15:03.987 --> 15:05.852
About us anything.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.607
What do you know
about this bounty hunter?

15:10.702 --> 15:13.034
Nothing. That's what worries me.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.828
He's a bounty hunter who
can create containment fields.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.658
--He's a Bararo.
--Bararo?

15:18.752 --> 15:20.242
Those guys are born trackers.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.168
He'll do whatever it
takes to bring in his prey.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.167
Including things way outside the law.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.919
I won't let that happen.

15:27.010 --> 15:30.377
As long as you're actually you.

15:30.472 --> 15:33.714
Fine, fine, we're friends. Okay? Friends!

15:33.809 --> 15:37.051
B.F.F.s, pinky swears,
borrow each other's bras.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.385
Can we just please move on?

15:38.480 --> 15:40.061
Yup, that's Hale, all right.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.059
The guy I hate right now.

15:43.944 --> 15:48.813
Whole building trapped
in a giant hunting snare.

15:50.492 --> 15:53.575
Clever. H u rt-y.

15:53.662 --> 15:56.620
I was so hoping to
storm off with a flourish.

15:56.706 --> 15:59.118
No exit.

15:59.209 --> 16:03.043
Not without taking Woods out.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.337
Why are you so desperate to leave?

16:06.925 --> 16:13.012
There's a lot to handle--
the doctor, Dyson, you.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.180
A lot of feelings.

16:15.267 --> 16:19.886
And what would you say
you're feeling for me?

16:19.980 --> 16:26.067
Pity. Attraction. Loathing.

16:26.153 --> 16:30.317
Whatever it is, it's exhilarating.

16:34.995 --> 16:37.202
Hey, sweet meat. You a'ight?

16:37.289 --> 16:41.123
I'm tip-tops. I love your boots.

16:42.669 --> 16:46.036
Yo. Boba Fett. I think I know
where Reynard is hiding.

16:48.758 --> 16:53.673
Oh, wow! This succubus' body is strong.

16:53.763 --> 16:57.051
I could snap this girl's
neck like a twig. Huh?

16:57.142 --> 17:01.727
Talk about ironic.
That would break Bo's heart!

17:01.813 --> 17:04.270
Be the last thing you do before
I rip your heart out, Reynard.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.143
Well, then you'd never get Bo back.

17:06.234 --> 17:09.897
She'd be stuck in limbo.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.603
That vision was a con.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.563
Why would I trust the
horror movie cliché

17:13.658 --> 17:15.489
that sent me to Hammer-geddon?

17:15.577 --> 17:18.284
Hamistagan. And I did
not bring you here.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.327
You have been pushed
out of your body by another.

17:20.415 --> 17:21.530
So put me back.

17:21.625 --> 17:24.287
I can only offer guidance.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.038
Follow the light.

17:31.426 --> 17:33.087
Which one?

17:33.178 --> 17:36.341
Merely an observer, remember?

17:38.600 --> 17:43.344
You and me, we're not finished.

17:43.438 --> 17:45.394
But for now...

17:46.775 --> 17:52.896
...eeny, meeny, miny...

17:54.658 --> 17:56.398
...mo.

17:58.495 --> 18:01.202
And they call me childish.

18:01.289 --> 18:04.952
Hey, Sixth Sense, observe this.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.249
This is going to get messy.

18:17.681 --> 18:21.344
Hey, Woods, you better
not go all U.F.C. on my B.F.F.!

18:21.434 --> 18:22.514
Woods, this is Bo's body!

18:22.602 --> 18:25.594
What, this piece of meat
between me and my payday?

18:29.651 --> 18:31.107
What the hell is going on?

18:31.194 --> 18:32.775
Bo, is that you?

18:35.156 --> 18:37.283
Oh, I'm not Bo, darlin'.

18:37.367 --> 18:38.982
No...

18:40.787 --> 18:42.368
lam.

18:57.595 --> 19:00.632
Man, where am I?

19:00.724 --> 19:02.134
Who am I?

19:02.225 --> 19:04.386
Why are my pants so tight?

19:05.562 --> 19:07.052
What the hell's on my face?

19:07.147 --> 19:10.059
Oh, dear. Have we...

19:10.150 --> 19:12.482
...have we all switched bodies?

19:12.569 --> 19:14.810
[KENZI (DYSON'S BODY)] Oh, crap.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.815
I'll get the nametags.

19:20.368 --> 19:21.653
Easy.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.917
Where's Reynard?

19:31.004 --> 19:34.167
I'm gonna gut that bastard
like a Mississippi crawdad.

19:34.257 --> 19:36.839
And we have Woods.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.717
And I'm really Bo.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.055
How'd this happen, old-timer?

19:41.139 --> 19:42.845
Yeah, Trick, what gives?

19:42.932 --> 19:46.845
I guess Bo caused a ripple effect
when she jumped back from limbo.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.063
Welcome back.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.978
Uh, Bo-bo!

19:51.066 --> 19:53.603
I got the wolfjunk, babe. Oh...

19:53.693 --> 19:57.277
Don't touch it. Don't touch anything.

19:57.364 --> 19:58.069
Sorry.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.695
Kenzi?

19:59.783 --> 20:01.944
Check me out!

20:02.035 --> 20:04.777
Kicking it in the Wolfman. Yeah.

20:04.871 --> 20:08.363
Kenzi. Kenzi, go sit down
before you break something.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.164
Rogen

20:10.251 --> 20:12.833
Wow, did you hear my voice?
That was, like, so sexy.

20:12.921 --> 20:15.128
Roger. Roger.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.501
Sit.

20:17.592 --> 20:19.048
Right.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.382
Wait--

20:23.473 --> 20:25.134
Who else we got?

20:26.643 --> 20:28.179
Ciara.

20:30.647 --> 20:33.309
And I'm Hale.

20:33.400 --> 20:37.018
Sorry about this, but...

20:37.112 --> 20:39.068
Wow.

20:41.449 --> 20:44.907
What did that take, two seconds?

20:44.994 --> 20:47.736
Sorry about that. Just...

20:47.831 --> 20:49.696
I said wait.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.413
D, how do the claws work? What, is it,
like, like a Wolverine-y thing or--

20:54.504 --> 20:56.745
She's not Dyson.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.671
lam.

21:01.761 --> 21:06.300
Which means that this liar is Reynard.

21:06.391 --> 21:08.803
Well then, I guess
I better just gut 'em both.

21:08.893 --> 21:12.351
Nah, nah, nah, let's figure this out.

21:12.439 --> 21:17.103
She's lying or he's lying. I'm Dyson.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.354
Can't take that chance, D.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.856
You neither, D.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.448
True dat.

21:22.532 --> 21:24.693
What we need to do is sit 'em down

21:24.784 --> 21:29.949
and play a little game
of good cop, Kenzi cop.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.904
Whoa!

21:32.000 --> 21:34.912
How does he control these pipes?
Did you see that?

21:40.550 --> 21:41.881
Where was Dyson born?

21:41.968 --> 21:44.050
What's Dyson's favourite food?

21:44.137 --> 21:45.422
What's Dyson's favourite position?

21:45.513 --> 21:47.128
--Ciara.
--Honestly, lady.

21:47.223 --> 21:50.966
Not sure. Well, why don't we ask Bo?

21:51.060 --> 21:53.767
Are all Fairies this freakin' jealous?

21:53.855 --> 21:56.346
Only when they've been lied to.

21:56.441 --> 21:57.851
This is ridiculous.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.227
I concur.

21:59.319 --> 22:01.981
Hale. What is it?

22:02.071 --> 22:05.984
I want to kiss you, a lot.

22:06.075 --> 22:09.238
Aw, man, what else was in my beer?

22:09.329 --> 22:12.571
You must be feeling
Ciara's passion for Dyson.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.530
The Gorgon blood must be

22:14.626 --> 22:18.244
intensifying the emotions
of the original body.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.794
Where's Lauren?

22:19.881 --> 22:21.746
If these two are both
claiming to be Dyson--

22:21.841 --> 22:23.547
The good doc must be in limbo.

22:23.635 --> 22:26.627
Where she might have to
deal with the Nain Rouge.

22:26.721 --> 22:29.463
That little girl really needs a time out.

22:29.557 --> 22:32.924
Bo, you met the Nain Rouge?

22:33.019 --> 22:35.726
Uh, maybe.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.025
What did you see in Hamistagan, Bo?

22:43.112 --> 22:44.898
Some damn effective birth control.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.480
I need to know everything.

22:47.575 --> 22:49.657
She calls herself the Nain Rouge.

22:49.744 --> 22:51.450
I've seen her before,
following me around.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.494
You've seen her before?
You should have told me.

22:53.581 --> 22:54.696
What was I gonna say?

22:54.791 --> 22:59.034
I seem to have attracted
some boarding school groupie?

22:59.128 --> 23:02.256
I'm sorry, really, I just didn't
know what to make of her.

23:02.340 --> 23:03.750
This is no joke.

23:03.841 --> 23:08.084
The Nain Rouge rarely appears and when
she does, it means trouble's on its way.

23:08.179 --> 23:10.261
What did she say to you?

23:11.724 --> 23:13.715
What have you done?

23:16.938 --> 23:19.099
It's complicated.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.476
Fine, we'll talk about this later.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.728
For now, I have to figure
out how to get everyone

23:22.819 --> 23:24.025
back into their own bodies before--

23:24.112 --> 23:26.854
--[DYSON (KENZI'S BODY)] Please. Please.
--Before all hell breaks loose?

23:28.283 --> 23:29.443
Stop, Woods!

23:29.534 --> 23:31.616
The "Who's the real Dyson"
quiz was amusing.

23:31.703 --> 23:35.161
But I think you'll find my
methods more effective.

23:39.210 --> 23:42.168
Uh oh! I know this look.

23:42.255 --> 23:45.122
She's hungry. Bo's body is hungry.

23:45.216 --> 23:48.424
Trick said our bodies retain an
echo of their original emotions.

23:48.511 --> 23:51.127
What about primal instincts to survive?

23:51.222 --> 23:52.428
To feed.

23:52.515 --> 23:55.131
If you insist.

23:55.226 --> 23:58.343
She won't--| won't be able to stop.

23:58.438 --> 24:01.225
--[BO (WOODS' BODY)] A little help, please!
--[DYSON (KENZI'S BODY)] Kenzi, get in there!

24:03.943 --> 24:05.683
Oh!

24:07.363 --> 24:10.696
Oh! I just watched myself die.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.739
You're not dead and
you're not going to be.

24:12.827 --> 24:15.193
Bo, you need to fix this,
she's fading fast.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.574
I can't, I'm not in the right body.

24:17.665 --> 24:21.749
Woo hoo. Man, did she taste good.

24:21.836 --> 24:22.951
What a rush.

24:23.046 --> 24:25.287
Kenzi. Get him out of here.

24:25.381 --> 24:26.541
I'm on it.

24:26.633 --> 24:30.717
Come on, dude, this is
for your own good. Come on.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.089
[TRICK] And be sure to chain him up.

24:40.521 --> 24:41.977
Ciara.

24:44.275 --> 24:46.937
I can't stay in this body forever.

24:47.028 --> 24:49.314
I can't do that to Hale's soul.

24:50.740 --> 24:55.109
Wow, I thought I felt alone before.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.501
I know you're upset.

25:02.585 --> 25:03.950
Save it.

25:04.045 --> 25:06.627
Just promise me
you'll take care of Dyson.

25:06.714 --> 25:08.830
I kind of get the feeling you
used to be pretty good at it.

25:08.925 --> 25:12.884
Whatever Dyson and I
had is over, Ciara.

25:12.970 --> 25:16.007
I found a photograph
of you... together.

25:16.099 --> 25:18.010
You're laughing.

25:18.101 --> 25:19.466
You look happy.

25:19.560 --> 25:22.051
I do?

25:22.146 --> 25:25.058
I was.

25:25.149 --> 25:27.561
What happened to him that
he won't even discuss you?

25:27.652 --> 25:31.144
Maybe he doesn't care.
Things change, Ciara.

25:32.990 --> 25:34.776
They sure do.

25:36.661 --> 25:39.152
You will take care of him?

25:39.247 --> 25:40.657
Promise me.

25:40.748 --> 25:43.785
I promise you that when
I get back into my own body,

25:43.876 --> 25:46.458
I'll breathe your chi back into you.

25:46.546 --> 25:49.663
I can do it, Ciara.

25:49.757 --> 25:52.715
How long do we have?

25:52.802 --> 25:54.884
[TRICK] More bad news.

25:54.971 --> 25:57.303
Reynard must be in Lauren's body.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.972
In the craziness of the attack,

26:00.059 --> 26:01.720
she somehow escaped.

26:01.811 --> 26:03.597
Great.

26:03.688 --> 26:05.428
Where would Reynard go?

26:07.233 --> 26:09.474
Nowhere good, sweet potato.

26:09.569 --> 26:12.276
Nowhere good.

26:12.363 --> 26:13.648
Come on, Woods.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.527
You've read the file,
know his history, think!

26:16.617 --> 26:20.656
Reynard's an anarchist, a murderer.

26:20.747 --> 26:23.284
He thrives on destruction.

26:23.374 --> 26:25.035
But he's in Lauren's body.

26:25.126 --> 26:27.208
And crazy as a sprayed roach.

26:27.295 --> 26:28.410
What are you thinking, Bo?

26:28.504 --> 26:31.746
That Reynard will be fuelled
by Lauren's deepest desires.

26:31.841 --> 26:36.084
So, any deep rage that she might have,

26:36.179 --> 26:41.970
even if it's too dark or subconscious
for Lauren herself to ever pursue.

26:42.059 --> 26:44.141
African shamans of the Congo.

26:44.228 --> 26:47.391
Lauren was looking for something
to reverse the curse on her girlfriend.

26:47.482 --> 26:51.316
A curse that made her
a slave to the Light.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.609
I know Lauren's deepest desires.

26:53.696 --> 26:55.561
I know where Reynard's gone.

26:57.158 --> 26:59.365
He's gone to kill the Ash.

27:05.792 --> 27:06.827
No luck.

27:06.918 --> 27:10.160
Whatever Woods put around the
building must be blocking all the signals.

27:10.254 --> 27:12.711
And I can't find a way of removing it.

27:12.799 --> 27:15.290
Though I did start a fire on Trick's rug.

27:15.384 --> 27:16.590
My eighth-century Persian rug?

27:16.677 --> 27:18.292
I'm sure those things are made to last.

27:18.387 --> 27:22.801
Manipulating my containment trap's
kind of a special skill, sweetheart.

27:22.892 --> 27:27.010
So is not succubus-ing
everybody I know to death.

27:27.104 --> 27:28.605
This is bad, Bo.

27:28.689 --> 27:31.977
I can still save her, Dyson.

27:32.068 --> 27:35.606
I hope so, or I rip Woods to shreds.

27:35.696 --> 27:39.063
With what? Those press-on nails?

27:43.079 --> 27:44.785
This is on your head, Woods.

27:44.872 --> 27:48.831
If a Dark Fae, even an insane one,
kills the new Ash,

27:48.918 --> 27:52.081
the already precarious peace
between our sides will crumble.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.958
Well, that just takes the
rag off the bush, don't it?

27:55.049 --> 27:56.914
Here's the deal.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.715
When we track him,

27:58.803 --> 28:03.888
nobody's bagging Reynard or the
massive reward for his return but me.

28:03.975 --> 28:05.260
Wait, Trick.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.888
How did Reynard get past
Woods' snare to begin with?

28:07.979 --> 28:10.220
Your containment trap only
works on Fae, doesn't it?

28:10.314 --> 28:14.148
Turns their own powers
back on 'em. Why?

28:14.235 --> 28:15.645
Reynard was in Lauren.

28:15.736 --> 28:17.237
And Lauren's human.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.528
Hold up. You had humans in here?

28:19.615 --> 28:21.355
Well why didn't somebody say so?

28:21.450 --> 28:25.034
So, the only other person who can
get out of here and warn Lachlan

28:25.121 --> 28:26.907
is another human.

28:33.588 --> 28:35.453
Good luck.

28:36.799 --> 28:39.415
Come to mama.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.628
Five shots and I am feelin' fine. Woo.

28:43.723 --> 28:47.136
Lordy, this body can drink!

28:47.226 --> 28:49.262
Hi, me.

28:49.353 --> 28:50.889
Hey, where are you going?

28:50.980 --> 28:52.390
Dyson .

28:56.694 --> 28:58.810
I have to stop Reynard.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.952
Oh, that does not look right.

29:20.134 --> 29:24.503
Trick will find a way to get
us back into our bodies, Ciara.

29:24.597 --> 29:26.178
Good luck.

29:29.060 --> 29:30.971
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Dude, dude, dude...

29:31.062 --> 29:32.768
Booby trap.

29:32.855 --> 29:36.222
It won't leave a scratch. Promise.

29:38.903 --> 29:40.689
It's chilly out there.

29:42.323 --> 29:43.608
I'm allergic to peanuts.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.906
And my hair does this crazy
thing when I get out in the rain--

29:45.993 --> 29:49.986
Kenzi, I'll take care of you.

29:50.081 --> 29:53.494
Every powerless, human inch of you.

29:55.878 --> 29:58.039
Dang, I look good in those boots.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.086
Oh, my, my.

30:00.174 --> 30:04.508
Dr. Lauren has so many
fun tools to play with.

30:04.595 --> 30:08.304
So many naughty concoctions.

30:10.393 --> 30:17.640
Oh, and so many reasons to be angry.

30:17.733 --> 30:19.234
Don't worry.

30:19.318 --> 30:22.435
Reynard's going to make
all your dreams come true.

30:22.530 --> 30:26.022
Well, maybe your nightmares.

30:31.080 --> 30:36.291
This is Dr. Lauren, the doctor.

30:36.377 --> 30:39.710
I'd like to request an
audience with the Ash, please.

30:58.774 --> 31:04.895
And if I should happen to start a war
in the process, let the flames fly!

31:08.409 --> 31:12.948
You know what, Bo, you are amazing.

31:13.039 --> 31:15.246
And you are drunk, Kenz.

31:15.332 --> 31:17.243
No, I am serious.

31:17.334 --> 31:22.499
I mean, the willpower it must take
for you to control your hunger.

31:22.590 --> 31:24.876
I mean, Woods is a pretty tough dude
and he was in your body for what, like,

31:24.967 --> 31:27.208
ten minutes, before he...

31:27.303 --> 31:31.421
...death-sucked Ciara
like an evil vacuum.

31:31.515 --> 31:35.428
Hey, do you think you
can really still save Ciara?

31:35.519 --> 31:38.932
I better, if I ever want
Dyson to talk to me again.

31:45.321 --> 31:47.607
What's it like in there, Kenz?

31:47.698 --> 31:51.361
Can you feel what he feels?

31:51.452 --> 31:54.068
Is he in love with Ciara?

31:54.163 --> 31:58.907
I never thought I'd say this,
Bo, but I can't tell you.

31:59.001 --> 32:02.289
It's his most private emotions.

32:02.379 --> 32:04.040
Even if he is a no-good wolfnik.

32:04.131 --> 32:07.089
I got it. My bad.

32:07.176 --> 32:08.211
Although, I must admit,

32:08.302 --> 32:11.465
it does feel like he's got a bit
of a foot fetish going on in here.

32:11.555 --> 32:14.012
I think that's still you, Kenz.

32:26.362 --> 32:28.603
Well, ain't that a peach.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.787
I always wanted to try
that hairpin trick.

32:58.185 --> 32:59.641
Ash?

33:03.440 --> 33:05.351
[LACH LAN] Little girl...

33:07.903 --> 33:09.518
...you're tardy.

33:11.740 --> 33:14.823
Actually, I'm Dyson.

33:18.831 --> 33:21.914
What's in the syringe
this time, Reynard?

33:22.001 --> 33:23.992
Freedom.

33:24.086 --> 33:26.498
Smells more like belladonna.

33:26.589 --> 33:28.921
Killing the Ash is just the catalyst.

33:29.008 --> 33:31.670
The Light will try to
retaliate against the Dark.

33:31.760 --> 33:35.423
The Dark will note the vacuum
in power and then pounce.

33:38.350 --> 33:39.851
All of which will lead to--

33:39.935 --> 33:44.144
--Chaos.
--Oh!

33:44.231 --> 33:46.688
What a beautiful word.

33:46.775 --> 33:48.731
It's only a matter of time, anyway.

33:48.819 --> 33:51.356
Something's coming. I can feel it.

33:51.447 --> 33:53.984
I'm just speeding things along.

33:54.074 --> 33:56.907
Well, I'm so glad I'm here to witness it.

33:56.994 --> 34:00.737
Although, I think Kenzi's
a little near-sighted.

34:00.831 --> 34:02.742
Not another step!

34:05.753 --> 34:07.618
Did you renovate, Lachlan?

34:07.713 --> 34:11.331
I tried modernizing a little bit.

34:11.425 --> 34:16.010
But some of the more
antiquated features remain.

34:17.723 --> 34:20.806
Yes, I've always liked this old floor.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.271
Heck of a security system.

34:39.662 --> 34:42.574
These things are good
for something after all.

34:47.670 --> 34:50.878
What if Dyson can't stop Reynard?

34:50.965 --> 34:55.334
What if he gets my wee body... dead?

34:55.427 --> 34:57.418
Then you'll both have to share Dyson's.

34:57.513 --> 34:59.925
That's not funny, Bo.

35:00.015 --> 35:03.507
How would we work the bathroom?

35:03.602 --> 35:06.059
It's going to be all right, Kenzi.

35:06.146 --> 35:08.137
[WOODS (BO'S BODY)] It really won't.

35:10.192 --> 35:11.807
How'd you get out?

35:11.902 --> 35:13.563
[KENZI (DYSON'S BODY)] Where's Trick?

35:13.654 --> 35:15.861
I've locked Trick down below.

35:15.948 --> 35:18.655
It's important the Light
never know I was here.

35:18.742 --> 35:21.575
That Reynard escaped
the Dark's clutches.

35:23.956 --> 35:26.368
I need to end this.

35:26.458 --> 35:29.245
Which is why I'm going to
burn this place to the ground.

35:29.336 --> 35:31.918
--You can't.
--Says who?

35:32.006 --> 35:35.214
I'm a succubus who just
topped up on Fairy chi.

35:35.301 --> 35:38.714
There ain't a man alive
who can stop me now.

35:43.350 --> 35:45.261
I'll take that bet.

35:47.521 --> 35:49.307
Come on, big man.

35:54.611 --> 35:58.274
Nobody uses my bestie's body
without buying her a drink first!

36:00.284 --> 36:02.741
Try to aim for not my face!

36:05.164 --> 36:07.621
This girl's body's more
powerful than you reckon.

36:07.708 --> 36:09.573
And more woman than you can handle.

36:11.962 --> 36:14.453
Oh, that was surreal.

36:23.891 --> 36:28.931
Hey, Woods, time for a face lift.

36:29.021 --> 36:30.682
You don't have it in you, sweetheart.

36:30.773 --> 36:32.229
Woods.

36:37.029 --> 36:39.941
Lock me in my own lair, will ya?

36:40.032 --> 36:42.614
You might have a headache tomorrow.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.817
This mean you found a way
to get us back into our bodies?

36:44.912 --> 36:48.450
Couple days in group therapy
ought to flush out the Gorgon blood.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.746
--Seriously?
--Seriously?

36:49.833 --> 36:51.334
No.

36:51.418 --> 36:54.205
All it'll take is a transluminal
migration circle.

36:54.296 --> 36:56.833
Ah well, I could have told you that.

36:59.051 --> 37:01.542
Special delivery.

37:01.637 --> 37:03.298
[BO (WOODS' BODY)] Just in time.

37:03.389 --> 37:05.755
--How's Lachlan?
--Pretty pissed.

37:05.849 --> 37:08.841
Did you guys see my
wolf moves? Woo hoo!

37:27.996 --> 37:36.620
[TRICK] Ego vocare te veritas.
Tibi ostenderet purus velit harum et.

37:36.713 --> 37:42.583
Tibi ostenderet purus velit harum et.

38:00.821 --> 38:02.186
[DYSON] Ciara?

38:08.537 --> 38:11.074
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

38:11.165 --> 38:12.655
Am I...?

38:12.749 --> 38:15.832
You? Yes.

38:15.919 --> 38:18.786
I was going to say alive.

38:18.881 --> 38:20.496
Thank you.

38:20.591 --> 38:22.832
I may not know everything
there is to know about you,

38:22.926 --> 38:26.214
but I'm glad you're you.

38:26.305 --> 38:30.514
Yeah, me too.

38:30.601 --> 38:31.761
Thank you.

38:31.852 --> 38:36.221
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are encouraged to attend

38:36.315 --> 38:40.103
the final judgment day of
our friend, Reynard, here.

38:40.194 --> 38:42.310
Although, it is on Dark Fae territory,

38:42.404 --> 38:46.568
so maybe I'll just tip my
cap and say thanks y'all.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.740
It's been a real treat.

38:51.038 --> 38:53.950
It's been a real treat, all right.

39:01.548 --> 39:04.164
Whoa, easy now, Doc.

39:04.259 --> 39:07.467
I'm tired. Hale, I'm not elderly.

39:07.554 --> 39:09.465
Okay.

39:09.556 --> 39:11.057
How was limbo?

39:11.141 --> 39:12.517
Weird.

39:12.601 --> 39:17.641
I saw my Aunt Edna and she
gave me her cheesecake recipe.

39:17.731 --> 39:19.437
Where were you?

39:19.525 --> 39:21.641
Uh, I don't even know.

39:21.735 --> 39:26.900
All I do know is that I feel well-rested
for the first time in a long time.

39:26.990 --> 39:28.946
I'm jealous.

39:29.034 --> 39:32.117
All right, let's get you home, Doc.

39:32.204 --> 39:34.035
--Goodnight.
--[LAUREN] Goodnight.

39:37.251 --> 39:39.082
[DYSON] We're going, too.

39:42.548 --> 39:44.789
Thank you.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.090
Is that the best you can do?

39:55.811 --> 39:57.642
And you.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.185
Yes?

40:00.816 --> 40:05.435
You are weak, pathetic,
and you need glasses.

40:06.863 --> 40:10.447
Oh, wow. That's kind of mean.

40:10.534 --> 40:14.493
It's a miracle you've
survived this long, Kenz.

40:14.580 --> 40:18.198
You just might be the strongest
person I have ever met.

40:23.005 --> 40:26.714
You know, I learned a
few things about you, too.

40:29.094 --> 40:33.258
Being inside you felt very empty.

40:33.348 --> 40:37.682
You're missing something
huge in here, aren't you?

40:46.361 --> 40:48.522
Come on, Ciara, let's go home.

40:56.455 --> 41:00.915
You know, normally that
might make me jealous.

41:04.171 --> 41:06.503
It shouldn't, Bo.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.176
Thanks for the whiskey.

41:13.263 --> 41:16.096
I figured you'd be off beer.

41:16.183 --> 41:19.175
So, what's going to happen to that
jackass bounty hunter, anyway?

41:19.269 --> 41:22.932
Well, I told Woods that
I wouldn't report him to the Light

41:23.023 --> 41:25.730
if he promised to never
set foot in my bar ever again.

41:25.817 --> 41:26.897
That's it?

41:26.985 --> 41:29.522
I also threatened to transform
him into a dung beetle.

41:29.613 --> 41:30.898
You can do that now?

41:30.989 --> 41:33.526
No. But he doesn't know that.

41:37.371 --> 41:43.583
Eventually, you're going to have to
tell me what the Nain Rouge said.

41:43.669 --> 41:47.002
She warned me.

41:47.089 --> 41:51.423
She said something big was coming.

41:51.510 --> 41:53.216
Something bad.

41:53.303 --> 41:57.967
Historically, the Nain Rouge
appears before major disasters.

41:58.058 --> 41:59.639
We're going to have
to keep our guard up.

41:59.726 --> 42:01.057
Don't we always?

42:01.144 --> 42:02.600
Yeah.

42:03.522 --> 42:04.978
Oh, yeah.

42:06.441 --> 42:08.978
She also called me "Isabeau."

42:13.198 --> 42:14.938
Did she now?

42:16.952 --> 42:17.816
We'll be fine.

42:17.911 --> 42:20.573
As long as everybody
stays in their own body

42:20.664 --> 42:22.905
and keeps their head about them.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.705
How hard should that be?

42:31.758 --> 42:36.127
