WEBVTT

00:06.369 --> 00:08.148
Did you do something to Andy Lau?

00:08.170 --> 00:10.942
- They haven't done anything!
- And they've got nothing to say.

00:10.963 --> 00:12.195
We know it was you, Felix.

00:12.216 --> 00:14.837
- We need to get the police off our backs!
- We get Andy back.

00:14.858 --> 00:16.790
You say that like it's actually possible.

00:16.811 --> 00:19.108
When I was lost in the forest,
I thought about you.

00:20.222 --> 00:22.549
So, um, are you new?

00:22.570 --> 00:23.937
Mia dumped me.

00:23.958 --> 00:27.817
- Excuse me, I'm still your teacher, Jake.
- Yeah, that's right, and nothing more.

00:27.838 --> 00:29.317
- Come here!
- I'll be right back.

00:29.338 --> 00:32.040
Those boys know something
about what happened to my brother.

00:32.061 --> 00:34.250
I found these
in Andy's internet history.

00:37.318 --> 00:40.286
If we had a real Water Element,
we could do a tracking spell.

00:40.307 --> 00:44.286
If there is another slightly less awesome
Water Element out there, how do we find it?

00:44.373 --> 00:45.966
Incoming!

00:48.746 --> 00:51.512
It's OK. You're the one
we're looking for.

Season 2, Episode 5

01:38.334 --> 01:41.334
Synced by Reef
addic7ed.com

01:42.969 --> 01:44.322
Missed it.

01:46.147 --> 01:47.522
That wasn't normal.

01:47.565 --> 01:50.511
A girl like Saskia shouldn't have
that much magical power.

01:50.923 --> 01:53.916
- What - more than you?
- More than any of us.

01:54.831 --> 01:58.390
How did you do it -
hover that water bomb?

01:58.542 --> 02:00.285
You tell me.

02:02.076 --> 02:04.097
- Got 'em.
- Good!

02:04.165 --> 02:06.745
This should be enough water
for a tracking spell.

02:06.766 --> 02:09.070
'Should'? I thought you said
you knew what to do.

02:09.091 --> 02:11.550
I do... kind of.

02:12.026 --> 02:14.940
If it works, the water will turn
into a scrying pool.

02:15.340 --> 02:16.697
In English...?

02:16.718 --> 02:19.245
We'll be able to see Andy
and track where he is.

02:19.266 --> 02:22.478
Floating water bombs
and magic spells...

02:22.742 --> 02:26.073
- I don't know about all this.
- You don't have to be afraid.

02:26.094 --> 02:28.856
Yeah, seriously. Who doesn't
want a crack at magic?

02:28.877 --> 02:30.941
- I guess.
- Better get started!

02:33.932 --> 02:37.353
Maybe Viv's right. Maybe this needs
to be a police thing now.

02:37.374 --> 02:41.188
I don't even know why you're here.
Didn't you just break up with Sam?

02:41.655 --> 02:42.899
Look.

02:44.494 --> 02:46.453
What are they doing with her?

02:46.830 --> 02:48.598
Sam and Saskia...?

02:52.988 --> 02:57.811
- Where are you going?
- You're right - why am I even here?

03:02.133 --> 03:05.201
This is the moment of truth.
Cross everything.

03:11.424 --> 03:13.122
It's beautiful.

03:13.496 --> 03:16.538
- What is it?
- The reason we still exist.

03:20.754 --> 03:24.794
As water is to water,
you will become as one.

03:26.017 --> 03:30.590
As water is to water,
you will find what I seek.

03:44.380 --> 03:48.602
As water is to water,
you will reveal and show.

03:59.518 --> 04:01.224
Felix, open the door!

04:01.456 --> 04:02.878
- Ellen!
- Hurry up, dude!

04:02.899 --> 04:04.850
Come on, Andy, where are you?

04:17.857 --> 04:19.630
Felix, I know you're in there!

04:19.651 --> 04:21.721
- How did you do that?
- Weren't we supposed to see Andy?

04:21.742 --> 04:23.515
But I followed the spell to the letter!

04:23.532 --> 04:25.981
No offence, sude - but this
seems like a dud to me.

04:27.469 --> 04:30.793
Well, it had to mean something.
Trust me, when have I let you down?

04:30.814 --> 04:33.626
Um, abducted to another universe?

04:33.627 --> 04:36.271
And an evil demon
trying to destroy us maybe?

04:36.292 --> 04:37.954
We can go on if you like!

04:37.975 --> 04:41.222
Felix! Seriously, this isn't funny!

04:42.754 --> 04:44.608
I'll talk to Ellen.

04:44.629 --> 04:47.266
Meet at my place and
we'll figure this out, OK?

04:47.287 --> 04:48.925
Let's get moving.

04:49.262 --> 04:50.837
Have it your way.

04:52.258 --> 04:53.932
Hi, Ellen!

04:57.000 --> 04:58.702
Nice of you to make an appearance!

04:58.723 --> 05:02.199
Ellen! Always a pleasure. Can't stop
now, though - fish emergency.

05:02.220 --> 05:04.586
- What were you doing in there?
- Class assignment.

05:04.607 --> 05:07.764
- With the door locked?
- These fish won't save themselves, Felix.

05:07.785 --> 05:09.670
We need to find them
a new home. <i>Pronto</i>.

05:09.671 --> 05:11.259
Are you still here?

05:12.659 --> 05:15.927
Felix, I have to tell you
something <i>in private</i>.

05:15.948 --> 05:17.770
Don't hate me.

05:18.507 --> 05:21.779
I don't hate you, Felix.
That would mean I care!

05:23.572 --> 05:26.863
That was amazing!
What else can you do?

05:26.963 --> 05:30.571
Lately, nothing useful.
I'm all over...

05:38.735 --> 05:40.587
Jake, are you OK?

05:42.275 --> 05:43.521
I think I'm right.

05:43.542 --> 05:46.644
Jake! Glad I caught you.

05:46.727 --> 05:49.658
Er, can I speak with you for a sec?

05:50.966 --> 05:52.408
Thanks, Saskia.

05:55.477 --> 05:58.569
- So, about dinner at my place tonight.
- Dinner...?

05:58.590 --> 06:02.002
Oh, awkward. Your mum said
something about voicemail...

06:02.023 --> 06:05.666
- I'm having dinner at your place?
- Yeah, tonight. Any requests?

06:05.667 --> 06:08.678
Right, look, I don't think I can
make it. I've got something on.

06:08.679 --> 06:11.784
It is important to your mum,
Jake, and me.

06:14.244 --> 06:17.575
- I'll see what I can do.
- Great! See you tonight, then.

06:20.603 --> 06:23.535
So, are you the teacher's pet?

06:24.398 --> 06:27.704
- It's complicated.
- I guess you don't wanna talk about it.

06:27.725 --> 06:30.533
- How could you tell?
- That's my other superpower.

06:37.423 --> 06:42.865
- First Sam, now she's flirting with Jake?
- She was in that room the whole time.

06:43.142 --> 06:47.509
Whatever's going on with those
headcases, the new girl is in on it.

06:51.118 --> 06:54.759
- Why would the water disappear?
- Instead of showing you Andy?

06:54.872 --> 06:56.767
It doesn't make any sense.

06:57.667 --> 07:01.980
Face it, dudes. The spell was
a bust, just like Mia and me.

07:05.355 --> 07:08.352
- It had to mean something.
- Then why did she dump me?

07:08.764 --> 07:11.981
Hey! What if you made a spell
that made her change her mind?

07:12.002 --> 07:15.094
- It doesn't work like that!
- Dude, you owe me!

07:15.144 --> 07:18.983
Everything was fine until you made us
disappear into that other universe.

07:19.826 --> 07:22.963
Maybe that's it. The water was
supposed to show us Andy -

07:22.984 --> 07:25.237
maybe there was nothing to show,
because he's not here.

07:25.258 --> 07:27.217
Obviously! That's why
we're looking for him.

07:27.238 --> 07:28.934
I don't mean Bremin - this universe!

07:28.955 --> 07:31.108
- Andy's in the other universe!
- Why not?

07:31.129 --> 07:34.348
That's where Ellen liked him and
where he was freakishly popular!

07:34.369 --> 07:36.384
He could have used magic
to go back there.

07:36.410 --> 07:39.104
You could go back too
with the new Element.

07:39.154 --> 07:43.349
That is the worst idea ever.
What if the demon is waiting for us?

07:43.370 --> 07:45.385
Well, what if the demon has Andy?

07:49.660 --> 07:51.995
We need to find Jake and Saskia.

07:59.995 --> 08:02.917
<i>Felix: Where are you?</i>

08:04.754 --> 08:07.379
You gonna turn that thing off?

08:07.748 --> 08:09.377
How long's this gonna take?

08:09.398 --> 08:12.664
I know it feels strange,
but just give it a chance.

08:13.098 --> 08:16.858
- You two might hit it off.
- He's my science teacher.

08:17.794 --> 08:20.355
- Hello!
- Ah, welcome.

08:24.395 --> 08:27.952
OK, well, come in.
Jake, I'll give you the grand tour.

08:30.158 --> 08:34.166
No, you better give your shoes a spritz.
You've got half of Bremin on them.

08:48.127 --> 08:50.269
Wow, this smells fantastic.

08:50.290 --> 08:52.989
Yeah, I backpacked
through Italy after uni

08:53.010 --> 08:56.766
and came across this recipe
in a little village there.

08:56.935 --> 08:59.630
Of course,
I've refined it over time.

08:59.631 --> 09:03.654
- Added my own little twist.
- You knew I love Italian.

09:04.113 --> 09:07.009
- Did I?
- Yes, you did.

09:07.059 --> 09:10.042
- I thought Thai was your favourite.
- You can love both.

09:10.063 --> 09:12.457
I make a mean
green chicken curry too.

09:12.458 --> 09:13.519
Mmm.

09:13.540 --> 09:15.885
Jake, you have got to try this.

09:15.906 --> 09:18.718
- Pass.
- Come on, Jake.

09:26.256 --> 09:27.504
Jake!

09:57.481 --> 09:59.389
Jake, are you alright?

09:59.991 --> 10:02.070
Uh... all good!

10:02.120 --> 10:06.043
- Will you please come out and talk to me?
- Just a minute.

10:09.380 --> 10:11.332
Now, please!

10:24.155 --> 10:28.166
Oh! Oh, Jake, you're really hot!
You got an upset stomach?

10:28.167 --> 10:30.326
- Something's upset.
- Everything OK?

10:30.347 --> 10:33.498
No, Jake's really burning up.
I'm gonna have to take him home.

10:33.519 --> 10:37.072
Oh, it's probably just that 24-hour thing.
It hit the school pretty hard last week.

10:37.093 --> 10:38.885
Sorry, Mr...

10:40.028 --> 10:42.482
- Sorry, Brian.
- Not to worry.

10:42.606 --> 10:45.617
We'll do it again some other time
when you're feeling up to it.

10:46.030 --> 10:47.637
Sorry.

11:11.610 --> 11:13.696
- Sam!
- Dude, he's right here.

11:15.783 --> 11:17.735
Oh, Felix!

11:19.576 --> 11:22.057
- What happened to you last night?
- We called and texted.

11:22.078 --> 11:25.148
- I had to go to Bates's house.
- Happy families. Awesome.

11:25.171 --> 11:26.328
So sorry.

11:26.349 --> 11:30.126
Hey, when he's your dad, do you think he's
gonna give you more homework or less?

11:30.127 --> 11:32.154
- Could be worse.
- How?

11:32.175 --> 11:34.232
No idea, just trying to make
you feel better.

11:34.259 --> 11:37.701
Right, well - know what happened
with the tracking spell?

11:37.722 --> 11:39.994
- In theory.
- Well...

11:40.063 --> 11:42.695
We think Andy might be
in the other universe.

11:42.716 --> 11:44.767
- You can't be serious!
- It gets better.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.171
Felix wants us to go
back and get him.

11:49.152 --> 11:51.991
Well, I guess we've made it there
and back before...

11:52.012 --> 11:54.776
Yeah! OK, well,
I've reworked the unmaking spell

11:54.797 --> 11:58.730
so we can travel between the universes.
We'll be gone before the first class.

11:58.760 --> 12:03.043
Right, well, you guys get
a head start. I'll catch up.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.907
What's going on?

12:06.866 --> 12:08.274
This.

12:12.191 --> 12:16.411
- I was kind of hoping it'd go away.
- This is magic, not man flu!

12:17.305 --> 12:18.923
It's spreading!

12:21.615 --> 12:23.567
OK, we have to find Saskia.

12:26.286 --> 12:30.012
- You're sure you can fix him?
- Multipurpose talisman to the rescue.

12:31.158 --> 12:32.575
Jake!

12:36.888 --> 12:38.770
That looks terrible.

12:38.838 --> 12:40.568
- Thanks!
- I didn't mean...

12:40.589 --> 12:43.388
- I know what you meant.
- It's moving faster.

12:43.438 --> 12:45.646
- Can you walk?
- I'm OK.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.742
Morning, gentlemen.

12:47.814 --> 12:51.064
Ready to reconstruct the scene
of Andy's disappearance?

12:51.183 --> 12:56.569
Hmm, well, long story short - checked
with your folks and they all signed off.

12:58.522 --> 13:01.677
- We have to get out of it.
- Do what Roland wants.

13:01.932 --> 13:03.303
Worry about me later.

13:03.324 --> 13:08.263
You'd be amazed at what a site visit
can do to... jog the memory.

13:09.629 --> 13:10.729
Come on.

13:14.868 --> 13:16.362
We'll find you.

13:23.319 --> 13:26.290
So, Andy was over here
next to the drinks?

13:26.454 --> 13:28.213
Are we all agreed on that?

13:28.945 --> 13:30.157
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:30.178 --> 13:31.383
Then, what?

13:31.777 --> 13:34.055
Then we kept following Andy.

13:34.076 --> 13:37.073
Mmm. Details, Felix -
did he walk, did he run?

13:37.094 --> 13:39.852
Did he talk to someone else, hmm?

13:39.873 --> 13:43.869
What about you two?
What did you see?

13:44.939 --> 13:47.564
Felix said that Andy grabbed
his bag and ran, and then...

13:47.585 --> 13:48.978
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:49.067 --> 13:50.613
Why did he take it?

13:53.699 --> 13:55.682
- Felix?
- I don't know!

13:56.015 --> 13:58.717
Then we followed him through there.

13:59.636 --> 14:01.001
I'll show you.

14:12.489 --> 14:15.706
Jake, how'd you pull up?

14:16.046 --> 14:19.916
Fine. It's just one of those
24-hour things, like you said.

14:19.917 --> 14:23.169
Are you sure you're on the mend?
You don't look great.

14:23.547 --> 14:25.279
I'm... I'm right.

14:26.067 --> 14:28.585
- All good.
- OK.

14:31.652 --> 14:34.981
We've already searched
the surrounding bushland, sir.

14:35.951 --> 14:37.950
I don't see where
he could have gone.

14:38.226 --> 14:39.609
Something happened here.

14:39.630 --> 14:41.368
How much longer
is this gonna take, Detectives?

14:41.389 --> 14:43.000
Has it spread any further?

14:44.368 --> 14:46.176
It's up to my chest now.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.803
- It's hard to breathe.
- Dude...

14:52.824 --> 14:55.432
- We have to get him out of here.
- How do we do that?

14:55.453 --> 14:59.455
So, Andy, he steals the bag, and
then he hightails it out of here...

14:59.476 --> 15:01.606
He didn't STEAL it.

15:01.759 --> 15:04.994
OK, you argue and he borrows it...

15:05.015 --> 15:06.982
It wasn't an argument!

15:07.219 --> 15:11.896
Then what - he just vanishes
and none of you saw anything?

15:11.917 --> 15:15.564
- Is that what I'm expected to believe?
- We don't know what happened.

15:16.882 --> 15:18.895
What about you...?

15:20.881 --> 15:22.945
Nothing to say?

15:24.894 --> 15:27.644
There was a lot going on.
The storm...

15:28.139 --> 15:30.070
- We were rushing...
- We should get back to school.

15:30.091 --> 15:31.368
No.

15:32.304 --> 15:35.104
No, we're going to go through
the whole thing again.

15:35.458 --> 15:37.380
- From the start.
- No!

15:37.663 --> 15:41.739
- We're not gonna find Andy like this.
- Then why don't you tell me how we will?

15:42.864 --> 15:44.566
Back to the start - now.

15:44.587 --> 15:48.183
If you want to charge us, then do it,
otherwise we don't have to be here!

15:48.213 --> 15:51.893
People who say that
usually have something to hide.

15:53.254 --> 15:55.217
What are you hiding, Felix?

15:55.838 --> 15:59.790
Detective, maybe we should
all just calm down a little bit.

15:59.838 --> 16:03.429
I'll take them back to school
and we can pick this up again later.

16:16.990 --> 16:18.621
See you in class, boys!

16:19.548 --> 16:21.417
There she is. Let's go.

16:21.555 --> 16:23.852
OK. Thanks for the lift, Mr Bates!

16:25.768 --> 16:28.612
OK, OK, OK! Put you down here.

16:32.864 --> 16:35.277
Are you sure the talisman
can fix this?

16:35.298 --> 16:37.548
It blitzes elemental attacks
like nothing else.

16:37.569 --> 16:43.516
Water, Fire, Earth, Air.
Elements that we all share.

16:45.397 --> 16:47.002
Shouldn't it be glowing?

16:47.040 --> 16:53.028
Water, Fire, Earth, Air!
Elements that we all share!

16:58.137 --> 17:00.089
Water, Fire...

17:02.797 --> 17:06.111
- The spell made it worse!
- There has to be something else in here.

17:06.249 --> 17:07.800
Nainai...

17:08.114 --> 17:09.462
No magic.

17:09.483 --> 17:11.387
In the other universe, Nainai
cured him from a poison...

17:11.388 --> 17:13.268
Well, this is more serious
than a stomach-ache!

17:13.289 --> 17:16.319
If the spells are speeding this up,
what if one more is too much?

17:16.425 --> 17:18.675
- Nainai.
- Come on.

17:23.605 --> 17:25.461
Dude, you're so heavy!

17:30.409 --> 17:35.238
- You want help, you find my grandson.
- Please! We'll wash up for a month!

17:37.602 --> 17:39.483
You were in my house!

17:39.503 --> 17:40.932
And you!

17:40.933 --> 17:44.438
- It was kind of a long story...
- That we don't have time to tell.

17:44.459 --> 17:46.812
Then out of my kitchen.
Things to do.

17:49.809 --> 17:53.433
Mrs Lau, the more of us
looking for Andy, the better.

17:53.454 --> 17:55.107
We need Jake.

17:57.078 --> 17:59.038
OK, show.

18:00.999 --> 18:02.853
Way to save the day.

18:05.441 --> 18:07.569
Jake, show her.

18:11.830 --> 18:14.903
- Do you know what's causing it?
- Silly boy! Obvious!

18:15.517 --> 18:17.605
- And...?
- Too much Earth!

18:17.751 --> 18:19.201
Very bad! Must fix!

18:19.222 --> 18:21.863
Too much Earth -
what does that even mean?

18:21.889 --> 18:23.698
And how do we fix it?

18:24.258 --> 18:26.907
Earth balanced by Water.

18:27.274 --> 18:31.793
Go now. Must hurry! Go!
Take him to water!

18:36.043 --> 18:39.978
- You - who are you?
- I'm Jake's friend.

18:40.217 --> 18:42.069
Too much Earth.

18:42.465 --> 18:44.434
You trouble.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.947
So, we need water - and a lot of it.

18:46.968 --> 18:50.152
- What - we just throw Jake into a river?
- Something like that!

18:50.179 --> 18:53.505
- The bath at my place!
- How do we get there? He weighs a ton!

18:53.649 --> 18:55.609
- The wheelbarrow!
- Nice!

18:56.180 --> 18:57.595
OK!

19:05.588 --> 19:07.823
"Too much Earth" - I don't get it!

19:07.879 --> 19:12.249
The spell, the body of water...
The only thing that was different was...

19:12.250 --> 19:13.978
The new Element.

19:14.524 --> 19:17.027
It was you. Has to be.

19:17.048 --> 19:19.273
But the spell worked!
I'm the missing element...

19:19.274 --> 19:21.572
I know, but what if you're not
the water element?

19:21.593 --> 19:24.092
She has to be magical, though,
doesn't she?

19:24.865 --> 19:26.932
But if she's not water...

19:27.132 --> 19:30.030
Whatever she is, she's turning Jake
into a giant garden gnome.

19:30.051 --> 19:32.527
- You're an Earth Element!
- But you said I was Water!

19:32.548 --> 19:35.335
That's what Nainai meant!
If Jake had an Earth overdose,

19:35.356 --> 19:37.477
it's because there was two
Earth Elements in the spell.

19:37.498 --> 19:39.420
- This is not her fault!
- I'm confused.

19:39.441 --> 19:42.249
If Saskia's Earth, then why did
the tracking spell work?

19:42.270 --> 19:45.150
I don't know, but she
can't come with us.

19:45.171 --> 19:47.138
- I want her there.
- Maybe I can help...

19:47.159 --> 19:49.324
No way! We can't risk it.

19:50.309 --> 19:52.546
I'm so sorry
if this is because of me...

20:14.126 --> 20:18.359
Stop! I'm filming everything!
What have you done to Jake?

20:18.380 --> 20:20.777
- It wasn't them.
- Ellen, we can't do this!

20:20.798 --> 20:24.094
Of course not! You've gotta take
Jake somewhere in a wheelbarrow.

20:24.115 --> 20:26.134
- It's all part of the big secret!
- Not now!

20:26.155 --> 20:29.324
Like that magic mumbo jumbo
I found in your bag -

20:29.345 --> 20:31.838
the same that Andy had
on his computer?

20:31.881 --> 20:33.663
You went through my bag?

20:33.714 --> 20:36.753
This is no time for a lover's tiff,
dude, come on!

20:44.886 --> 20:46.447
Uh, Felix?

20:48.011 --> 20:50.318
- What's that on his skin?
- Nothing!

20:51.103 --> 20:53.468
- I'm calling the police.
- That's not what he needs!

20:53.489 --> 20:55.445
Like I trust <i>you!</i>

20:57.992 --> 20:59.713
Felix!

21:01.683 --> 21:05.687
It's calling like before,
when we did the tracking spell.

21:07.281 --> 21:11.224
- Ellen was outside the classroom.
- And now the talisman's working.

21:11.250 --> 21:14.308
The missing Element
wasn't Saskia, it's Ellen!

21:14.980 --> 21:18.413
- Ellen, you're the one!
- Back off, psycho!

21:18.434 --> 21:20.429
I'm calling them. You can't stop me.

21:20.857 --> 21:24.873
Water, Fire, Earth, Air.

21:29.094 --> 21:31.511
- You're the missing Water Element.
- Go away!

21:31.512 --> 21:35.492
Water, Fire, Earth, Air.

21:39.179 --> 21:42.492
Sam, do something!
The Elements need to be together!

21:42.525 --> 21:44.509
She's too far away!

21:49.520 --> 21:50.851
Give it back!

21:51.155 --> 21:52.502
Give it back now, Sam!

21:52.523 --> 21:55.880
- Water, Fire, Earth, Air!
- What are you doing?!

21:56.031 --> 21:59.015
Stop being stupid, Sam!

22:00.204 --> 22:04.145
- Give it back!
- Water, Fire, Earth, Air.

22:10.179 --> 22:11.847
It worked.

22:12.826 --> 22:14.818
Jake! Jake!

22:15.244 --> 22:18.220
It's OK now. Look.

22:22.928 --> 22:26.327
What is going on, Felix?
You better tell me.

22:26.348 --> 22:29.872
We need you to come with us
to help find Andy.

22:29.893 --> 22:32.010
Why would I go anywhere with you?

22:32.031 --> 22:34.259
Because we'll tell you the truth
about everything.

22:35.835 --> 22:39.115
So, we're gonna do a spell
to go to another universe.

22:39.136 --> 22:41.165
- From your diary.
- The Book Of Shadows.

22:41.186 --> 22:44.280
To find Andy, who got
vacuumed up into a cloud

22:44.301 --> 22:46.316
when he was trying to increase
his magic power?

22:46.337 --> 22:48.435
Well, it was more of a twister, actually.

22:48.456 --> 22:50.931
The same universe we were in
when we went missing.

22:51.432 --> 22:54.432
I hope that crazy isn't contagious.

22:57.885 --> 22:59.452
Take this.

23:01.286 --> 23:03.303
Can't you just do
what someone says for once?

23:03.324 --> 23:04.822
Means a lot coming from you.

23:07.641 --> 23:09.750
Prepare to have
your perception altered.

23:12.716 --> 23:16.434
Divinity of the Elements,
I summon thee.

23:16.540 --> 23:19.327
Through this world, we can see.

23:19.420 --> 23:22.202
Another place where we can be.

23:23.474 --> 23:26.724
Take the Fire, make it burn.

23:26.902 --> 23:29.395
Take the Air and make it turn.

23:30.830 --> 23:34.128
Take this Water and this Earth -

23:34.429 --> 23:38.131
and to another world
call us forth.

23:48.377 --> 23:51.356
Divinity of the Elements,
I summon Thee!

23:51.377 --> 23:55.755
Through this world, we can see.
Another place where we can be.

23:55.901 --> 23:58.916
Take the Fire, make it burn.

23:58.917 --> 24:01.432
Take the Air and make it turn.

24:01.653 --> 24:07.152
Take this Water and this Earth,
and to another world call us forth.

24:07.473 --> 24:11.398
Earth, Water, Fire, Air!...

24:15.566 --> 24:19.988
Earth, Water, Fire, Air!

24:25.292 --> 24:29.242
Nobody thinks it's weird that the
detective was behaving like a hobo?

24:29.263 --> 24:32.083
Oh, I get it -
we're in another universe.

24:32.104 --> 24:33.440
Still haven't seen them.

24:33.476 --> 24:36.007
Teenagers don't just
disappear into a forest.

24:36.028 --> 24:37.308
You'd be surprised.

24:37.329 --> 24:39.527
We need your help.
We need to check the hide-out.

24:39.548 --> 24:42.531
- Andy might be there.
- Felix, check this out! Chicken feet!

24:42.552 --> 24:45.579
I placed offering for ghost boy.
Important you feed ghosts.

24:45.600 --> 24:46.809
What about the school?

24:46.829 --> 24:48.984
Andy might have gone back
to see his girlfr...

24:49.005 --> 24:51.213
Um, his special friend.

24:51.512 --> 24:54.385
That uber nerd has a special friend?

24:54.406 --> 24:57.878
What happens when two of the same
person from different universes meet?

24:57.899 --> 24:59.684
I don't know, but it can't be good.

24:59.705 --> 25:03.004
What about the incredibly powerful demon who
wants to restore us out of this universe?

25:03.025 --> 25:04.880
The demon's taken over
the whole netball team!

25:04.901 --> 25:06.811
- How could you tell?
- You could tell!
