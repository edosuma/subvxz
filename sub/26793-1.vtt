00:47.495 --> 00:49.025
Who prays for Satan?

00:49.049 --> 00:51.051
The original sinner.

01:25.223 --> 01:27.156
I can't move.

01:27.811 --> 01:29.296
Why can't I move?

01:29.917 --> 01:33.093
Please, talk to me.

01:53.354 --> 01:56.092
Somebody get us out of here...
Shut up!

01:56.116 --> 01:58.428
Help! Please, help.

02:09.543 --> 02:12.235
Please.

02:19.380 --> 02:20.519
Aah.

02:22.556 --> 02:24.005
Hmm. Hmm.

02:33.705 --> 02:35.096
You should try this.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.098
Don't hurt me.

02:37.122 --> 02:40.367
- You have to try it.
- Yeah.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.059
What's your name?

02:43.887 --> 02:45.095
Elise.

02:46.890 --> 02:48.627
Elise.

02:48.651 --> 02:51.285
You're gonna rape and
murder me, aren't you?

02:51.309 --> 02:53.621
I don't sell damaged goods.

02:55.140 --> 02:56.797
I used to raise plants.

02:58.281 --> 03:00.421
Can you guess what kind?

03:02.630 --> 03:03.666
Hmm?

03:05.875 --> 03:08.740
Venus fly traps.

03:09.706 --> 03:11.743
I was a different kind of...

03:12.226 --> 03:13.814
farmer, back then.

03:14.849 --> 03:18.439
You gotta watch
when they flower.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.511
Flowers drain energy.

03:22.167 --> 03:24.249
They weaken the plant.

03:24.273 --> 03:27.597
You have to nip the flower

03:27.621 --> 03:31.314
as soon as they start to grow.

03:32.177 --> 03:34.742
If you don't stop the growing,

03:34.766 --> 03:39.333
you run the risk of weakening
the rest of the plant.

03:55.407 --> 03:56.419
Hey.

03:56.443 --> 03:59.180
Hey! You don't have
to worry about them.

03:59.204 --> 04:01.458
You're not going
where they're going.

04:01.482 --> 04:03.864
You're going to a
much better place.

04:05.900 --> 04:07.153
Where?

04:07.177 --> 04:10.502
To the farm. Believe me.

04:10.526 --> 04:13.332
It's a much better place
than where they're going.

04:37.104 --> 04:40.659
- Follow the yellow line.
- Do not deviate.

04:42.489 --> 04:46.147
Follow the yellow line.
Do not deviate.

04:47.701 --> 04:51.301
Follow the yellow line.
Do not deviate.

04:51.325 --> 04:54.570
They will fall to the last up there.
Follow the yellow line.

04:56.917 --> 04:58.919
We will fall and rise.

05:09.895 --> 05:11.252
Time to die.

05:20.492 --> 05:21.631
Here.

05:23.150 --> 05:24.324
Here.

05:35.852 --> 05:37.198
Listen to me.

05:42.514 --> 05:43.584
My gun.

06:35.947 --> 06:37.638
This is our end game.

06:38.777 --> 06:41.331
We had to play this
through, Agent Boon.

06:46.060 --> 06:47.579
The whole time.

06:51.790 --> 06:52.998
You want me alive.

07:01.248 --> 07:04.596
- Follow the yellow line.
- Do not deviate.

07:08.186 --> 07:10.889
Follow the yellow line.
Do not deviate.

07:10.913 --> 07:13.995
You had me wondering right up until
you fired the shot, Agent Boon.

07:14.019 --> 07:16.815
- Follow the yellow line.
- Do not deviate.

07:19.369 --> 07:21.520
I healed nicely,
don't you think?

07:21.544 --> 07:24.489
Follow the yellow line.
Do not deviate.

07:24.513 --> 07:27.353
There's no woman here
to warm your bed, Sieg.

07:27.377 --> 07:29.321
Follow the yellow line.
Do not deviate.

07:29.345 --> 07:31.312
I will fuck you in hell.

07:32.555 --> 07:35.558
Follow the yellow line.
Do not deviate.

07:39.148 --> 07:41.875
Should you wish to terminate
before processing.

08:13.251 --> 08:14.884
Agent Boon.

08:14.908 --> 08:15.919
Welcome to Death House.

08:15.943 --> 08:17.749
It's good to see you
again, Captain Galan.

08:17.773 --> 08:21.097
Victor. You earned the
right to call me that.

08:21.121 --> 08:22.201
Some place.

08:22.225 --> 08:24.031
Does it live up to
what you studied?

08:24.055 --> 08:25.988
Ask me again in 12 hours.

08:27.334 --> 08:28.863
Dr. Fletcher,

08:28.887 --> 08:30.347
meet Agent Boon.

08:30.371 --> 08:31.521
Agent Boon.

08:31.545 --> 08:32.798
Dr. Fletcher, ma'am,

08:32.822 --> 08:35.791
I don't know whether to shake
your hand or to kneel...

08:37.620 --> 08:40.736
Knock knock. Agent Novak.
Good to see you again.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.004
Likewise, sir.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.523
Hi.

08:44.039 --> 08:45.386
Dr. Fletcher.

08:45.732 --> 08:46.974
Agent Novak.

08:48.044 --> 08:49.435
No, Dr. Redmane?

08:49.459 --> 08:50.737
Oh, you'll meet.

08:51.634 --> 08:54.268
Right now, meet your
fellow graduate,

08:54.292 --> 08:55.649
Agent Toria Boon.

08:55.673 --> 08:57.927
You should have a lot in common.

08:57.951 --> 09:00.125
Your Honors request,
is first order.

09:51.936 --> 09:53.223
What is this?

09:53.247 --> 09:54.697
Your Honors request.

09:56.250 --> 09:58.125
Containment shield lowered.

10:43.056 --> 10:44.229
Jesus Christ.

10:44.782 --> 10:45.966
Mom.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.552
You son of a bitch!

11:01.971 --> 11:02.971
Ah!

11:18.160 --> 11:20.265
Free them.

11:42.046 --> 11:43.150
Who is she?

11:44.393 --> 11:46.405
Alma Lin Kinny.

11:46.429 --> 11:49.305
The press named
her, "Leatherlace."

11:49.329 --> 11:51.928
She killed and
skinned her victims

11:51.952 --> 11:54.655
with the help of her lover,
whom she eventually killed.

11:59.235 --> 12:01.248
The video footage is hers.

12:01.272 --> 12:05.069
They found hundreds of hours in
her apartment after her arrest.

12:07.243 --> 12:10.730
Am I seeing your and Dr. Redmane's
tabula rasa research?

12:12.317 --> 12:13.629
Part of it.

12:18.461 --> 12:20.854
God, I don't want to go!

12:20.878 --> 12:22.787
Ugh!

12:22.811 --> 12:27.125
She's been listening to that audio
feed for the last 200 days.

12:28.471 --> 12:31.899
No! I can't do it. I can't.

12:31.923 --> 12:34.971
We then used our
classified compound

12:34.995 --> 12:37.653
to ensure total mind erasure.

12:39.034 --> 12:43.083
Some people here call
it, milk of amnesia.

12:43.107 --> 12:46.086
The hologram footage on
her tube is her father.

12:46.110 --> 12:49.814
It's part of her mental reformat.
As she feared him.

12:49.838 --> 12:52.713
It's like Clockwork
Orange.Mmm-hmm.

12:52.737 --> 12:55.474
We can reprogram
all new memories,

12:55.498 --> 12:58.778
erase them and put new ones in.

13:03.852 --> 13:06.244
Textbook case, really.

13:06.268 --> 13:08.487
Yeah.

13:08.511 --> 13:09.754
Our goal

13:10.341 --> 13:12.343
is to eradicate evil.

13:16.002 --> 13:19.636
And at long last,
Dr. Karen Redmane.

13:19.660 --> 13:22.467
Hello. Doctor, Agent Boon.

13:22.491 --> 13:23.848
Great to meet you.

13:23.872 --> 13:26.436
Wow, I've read your
work for years.

13:26.460 --> 13:29.025
There'll be a quiz
following the tour. Yeah?

13:29.049 --> 13:32.132
I trust Dr. Fletcher
has been helpful

13:32.156 --> 13:33.951
and charming.

13:38.852 --> 13:41.555
They're all paralyzed
with curare,

13:41.579 --> 13:44.696
and fed a steady drip of
barbiturates through one arm

13:44.720 --> 13:47.274
and amphetamine and LSD
through the other.

13:48.379 --> 13:51.900
The mix creates a brain flush.

13:54.730 --> 13:56.974
But, much like panning for gold,

13:57.664 --> 13:59.355
yields nuggets of truth.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.059
So, you do the scrubbing,

14:03.083 --> 14:05.741
and you do the actual laundry.

14:06.293 --> 14:07.812
Girl power.

14:09.538 --> 14:12.103
Some are dosed with just LSD,

14:12.127 --> 14:15.278
while others are subjected
to electroshock,

14:15.302 --> 14:16.832
sensory deprivation...

14:16.856 --> 14:20.318
all to break down the
subject's personality,

14:20.342 --> 14:22.182
which can then be replaced...

14:22.206 --> 14:23.597
Transhumanism.

14:23.621 --> 14:26.807
Mental illness is contagious.

14:26.831 --> 14:33.918
Sick people spread sickness
by art, writing, words.

14:33.942 --> 14:38.094
There is no coincidence in
the rise of social media

14:38.118 --> 14:40.362
and the rise of social violence.

14:41.708 --> 14:43.789
I rest my case.

14:43.813 --> 14:46.344
Like the old backmasking.

14:46.368 --> 14:49.958
You know, hand the devil by playing
a record backwards, kind of shit.

14:50.959 --> 14:53.351
That was proven in the Nazi era,

14:53.375 --> 14:56.941
And the Jim Jones
halt in Guyana.Ah...

14:56.965 --> 14:59.944
Which was preempted by
congressman Ryan's inspection.

14:59.968 --> 15:03.937
Well, we're not fans of
congressional oversight here.

15:04.386 --> 15:05.225
I see.

15:05.249 --> 15:08.090
What a nice sig
to our next stop.

15:08.114 --> 15:09.781
You'll all be meeting again.

15:09.805 --> 15:12.325
Until then. I look
forward to it.

15:13.015 --> 15:14.475
Yeah.

15:14.499 --> 15:15.960
Yeah, we'll talk more.

15:15.984 --> 15:17.064
Yes.

15:17.088 --> 15:18.928
Yes, Dr. Fletcher,
I'm on my way.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.724
This is your virtual tour,
take it at your own pace.

15:21.748 --> 15:24.761
I will be available
for questions.

15:24.785 --> 15:27.523
K.O Complex East, Death House.

15:27.547 --> 15:29.318
Begin virtual tour.

15:29.342 --> 15:32.355
The Death House,
established in 1954,

15:32.379 --> 15:34.357
under the Eisenhower
administration,

15:34.381 --> 15:37.843
was created in the wake
of operation paperclip.

15:37.867 --> 15:42.124
This facility serves as a federal
maximum security prison,

15:42.148 --> 15:46.576
Medical, psychological and para
psychological research center.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.061
There are nine levels.

15:48.085 --> 15:50.787
With the first dedicated
to prisoner intake

15:50.811 --> 15:53.100
and minimum security
confinement.

15:53.124 --> 15:57.622
The ninth and final level is
reserved for the five evils.

15:57.646 --> 16:00.142
One mile into the earth.

16:00.166 --> 16:03.179
Prisoners are confined
to virtual environments

16:03.203 --> 16:06.320
that recreate environments
before confinement,

16:06.344 --> 16:09.979
to preserve their natural
surroundings for study.

16:10.003 --> 16:13.293
Each containment cell is
fed a chronic gas mixture,

16:13.317 --> 16:15.191
to keep the prisoners amenable

16:15.215 --> 16:17.676
to the virtual
illusions around them.

16:17.700 --> 16:19.816
Agent Jae Tinyn Novak,

16:19.840 --> 16:21.370
32 years of age.

16:21.394 --> 16:23.820
Honors request granted.

16:23.844 --> 16:28.539
Final advancement
scenario: 108-19-83.

16:36.892 --> 16:38.974
Agent Toria Lex Boon,

16:38.998 --> 16:40.803
32 years of age.

16:40.827 --> 16:43.081
Honors request granted.

16:43.105 --> 16:48.569
Final advancement
scenario: 0917-1967.

16:49.870 --> 16:52.332
Now you both know why
you made it this far.

16:52.356 --> 16:56.094
The ninth level is reserved
entirely for the five evils,

16:56.118 --> 16:58.879
and is also the most
heavily secured.

16:59.708 --> 17:01.720
Hirace Giger, former Nazi-head

under U.S.-Russian Psy exchange.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.590
Cannibal, necromancer.

17:43.614 --> 17:46.962
Connected to deaths
of over 700 children.

18:06.015 --> 18:08.132

18:10.296 --> 18:14.897

turning victims inside out.

18:14.921 --> 18:17.175

18:17.199 --> 18:20.075
Predominant number
of victims: Female.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.515
Apprehended: 1984.

18:28.486 --> 18:32.156
Even in this sunlight, I
can see your eyes boy.

18:32.180 --> 18:35.183
Come a little closer.
Have a look.

18:36.908 --> 18:39.024
You can see me?

18:39.048 --> 18:43.305
You were in my cell
because of technology.

18:43.329 --> 18:46.263
This is a great time to
be alive, innit boy?

18:47.781 --> 18:48.781
So...

19:03.452 --> 19:05.085
So,

19:05.109 --> 19:07.180
the real question here is,

19:08.181 --> 19:10.356
why are they showing you me?

19:12.081 --> 19:13.290
You like this?

19:14.808 --> 19:16.993
You like to see it like this?

19:17.017 --> 19:18.478
To get your gun hard?

19:18.502 --> 19:21.332
Or maybe it's the guy that
does it for you. Maybe both.

19:22.264 --> 19:23.748
What the fuck is this?

19:25.405 --> 19:27.901
They blamed your kid
brother for this.

19:27.925 --> 19:29.478
Sent him to camp, right?

19:32.481 --> 19:34.690
When I heard you
were coming here,

19:36.209 --> 19:38.280
I asked for this moment.

19:39.937 --> 19:41.490
Confession if you will.

19:42.629 --> 19:43.768
Do you pray, boy?

19:45.184 --> 19:48.059
I'm not really sure why I do.

19:48.083 --> 19:50.165
Maybe more for them than me.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.087
I don't even know
if there's a soul.

19:53.157 --> 19:55.055
I know there's gotta
be something.

19:56.264 --> 19:57.644
Something more...

19:58.887 --> 20:00.865
Just don't know what.

20:00.889 --> 20:04.133
You've got your blood and
tissue, and all that goes away.

20:04.893 --> 20:08.631
But, I think, perhaps,

20:08.655 --> 20:10.278
there is something more.

20:12.072 --> 20:13.350
Yeah.

20:14.868 --> 20:17.354
Perhaps there is.

20:19.839 --> 20:23.843
They've got some surprises waiting
for you and your girl, here.

20:28.296 --> 20:29.814
They were video glitches.

20:31.989 --> 20:34.612
We've been having
technical difficulties.

20:42.344 --> 20:46.245
Those people... victims, in
those cells, who are they?

20:47.694 --> 20:51.502
You know, I think we've covered
enough for the first session.

20:51.526 --> 20:53.424
Why don't you two take a break?

20:55.426 --> 20:57.508
Yeah, I pretty much live here.

20:57.532 --> 21:01.028
I mean, I did 73
hours last week.

21:01.052 --> 21:04.539
By the way, did you guys fix
that power issue inside or what?

21:10.821 --> 21:12.074
Mitchell...

21:12.098 --> 21:13.455
are you guys seeing this?

21:13.479 --> 21:15.767
Looks like we have a bloody
rag here on the barbwire.

21:33.153 --> 21:35.432
I think we have skunks
in the dumpster again.

21:43.923 --> 21:44.924
Central...

21:46.719 --> 21:47.927
Central, come in.

21:59.870 --> 22:01.019
Jesus Christ.

22:28.968 --> 22:30.314
Yeah!

22:48.090 --> 22:49.264
So...

22:51.439 --> 22:53.958
They let you kill the guy who
killed your mother, huh?

23:00.551 --> 23:02.381
It was my Honors request.

23:05.211 --> 23:07.524
I took the lives of
two innocent people.

23:08.248 --> 23:09.457
I earned it.

23:11.113 --> 23:13.471
Okay.

23:13.495 --> 23:16.360
What was your Honors request
for slitting those throats?

23:18.845 --> 23:19.984
Let me ask you something.

23:22.815 --> 23:25.404
Do you ever get deja
vu coming in here?

23:27.129 --> 23:30.892
We're the best of the
best of our class.

23:34.447 --> 23:35.793
Do you really believe that?

23:39.176 --> 23:40.557
I think you do.

23:44.837 --> 23:45.837
Yeah.

23:53.224 --> 23:54.709
What do your birds mean?

23:56.124 --> 23:57.436
I drew 'em.

23:58.851 --> 24:00.542
11 birds...

24:01.440 --> 24:02.820
but I can't remember.

24:04.028 --> 24:05.064
And the girl?

24:12.036 --> 24:13.313
Same thing.

24:17.110 --> 24:18.457
But I don't know why.

24:19.423 --> 24:21.815
I'm the same way. I don't know.

24:21.839 --> 24:24.335
It's odd... I

24:24.359 --> 24:27.511
don't remember where...
how I got them... why?

24:27.535 --> 24:30.676
Marigold... the name...

24:31.884 --> 24:35.543
It means something. I can
see it in my dreams, but...

24:36.405 --> 24:37.752
I don't know what it is.

24:44.344 --> 24:46.070
Do you remember anybody
from my class?

24:47.244 --> 24:50.499
Like fuckin' facebook friends?

24:50.523 --> 24:53.122
Like, any of that kind of shit?

24:53.146 --> 24:55.010
You're askin' me if I'm single?

24:58.531 --> 25:00.499
I wouldn't care if you weren't.

25:01.672 --> 25:02.915
My point is.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.953
I don't remember anyone.

25:09.024 --> 25:10.370
Not one person.

25:15.997 --> 25:17.032
Well,

25:18.447 --> 25:21.761
like you said, "We're
the best of the best."

25:23.418 --> 25:25.454
Holy Christ.

25:29.631 --> 25:32.013
What the hell happened?
What the...

25:34.705 --> 25:37.615
K.O complex, East, Death House.

25:37.639 --> 25:39.779
Begin virtual tour.

25:48.270 --> 25:50.732
I love being an avatar.

25:50.756 --> 25:52.689
One of the perks of the job.

25:55.795 --> 25:57.428
He will be conditioned.

25:57.452 --> 25:58.981
Mind erased.

25:59.005 --> 26:02.398
Reformatted with proper
morals, compassion,

26:02.422 --> 26:04.424
and obedience for the law.

26:06.288 --> 26:08.567
You will become transhuman.

26:09.153 --> 26:10.510
Better than human,

26:10.534 --> 26:12.788
once the physical
conditioning is completed,

26:12.812 --> 26:16.102
or as you put it, "The laundry."

26:16.126 --> 26:20.589
What's the difference between
transhumanism and brainwashing?

26:20.613 --> 26:23.582
Well, it's a different
process entirely.

26:24.341 --> 26:26.757
And we don't have an agenda.

26:27.516 --> 26:29.356
We instill morality.

26:29.380 --> 26:31.624
Morality?

26:33.143 --> 26:37.123
Principles concerning the
distinction between good or bad

26:37.147 --> 26:39.149
and, right and wrong.

26:41.910 --> 26:42.911
Whose morality?

26:44.982 --> 26:46.615
I mean, I slit some
fucker's throat.

26:46.639 --> 26:48.824
Am I a candidate
for transhumanism?

26:48.848 --> 26:50.574
Well, what about me?

26:51.540 --> 26:53.760
I killed a man for revenge.

26:53.784 --> 26:57.857
I executed a mother and her
son in the line of duty.

26:59.687 --> 27:03.760
The agent, who
brought Sieg to us,

27:05.106 --> 27:06.980
she did the good thing.

27:07.004 --> 27:10.156
Don't let these
experiments confuse you,

27:10.180 --> 27:12.769
or make you feel otherwise.

27:13.597 --> 27:15.841
We're excising a moral cancer.

27:17.049 --> 27:19.914
Did Sieg ever mention
Death House to you?

27:23.262 --> 27:25.609
Ever any talk of the five evils?

27:38.070 --> 27:39.910
How do we even know if
any of this is real?

27:39.934 --> 27:43.696
What if this is all
one giant VR program?

28:10.171 --> 28:13.357
Dr. Redmane will show you
wardrobe to start the tour.

28:13.381 --> 28:15.038
I'll meet you after.

28:17.799 --> 28:20.122
Bennett, good afternoon.
Ah, hey!

28:20.146 --> 28:22.573
Welcome to central casting.

28:22.597 --> 28:24.748
This is special Agents
Boon and Novak.

28:24.772 --> 28:25.956
Nice to meet you,
Boon and Novak.

28:25.980 --> 28:28.303
Let me introduce you to
my partners in crime.

28:28.327 --> 28:30.650
Please, doctors join us.

28:30.674 --> 28:33.342
Dr. Angela Freeman,
Dr. Logan Harrison.

28:33.366 --> 28:34.619
Hi, nice to meet you.

28:34.643 --> 28:37.070
We would love a behind
the scenes tour.

28:37.094 --> 28:39.659
Ah! A little movie magic.

28:39.683 --> 28:40.902
Right this way.

28:40.926 --> 28:45.769
I like to equate all this to...
Excuse me.

28:45.793 --> 28:48.219
Looking down on an
ant hill, okay?

28:48.243 --> 28:49.255
It looks like chaos.

28:49.279 --> 28:50.946
Quite frankly, sometimes
it feels like chaos.

28:50.970 --> 28:53.362
But each ant has its own job,

28:53.386 --> 28:54.950
and knows exactly what to do.

28:54.974 --> 28:58.505
Everything is recreated
down to the final detail.

28:58.529 --> 29:00.300
We choose our
subjects according to

29:00.324 --> 29:03.718
facial structure, body weight,
eye color, even scent.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.754
What kind of scents?

29:05.778 --> 29:09.240
Hair, cosmetic, body
odor, feminine odor...

29:09.264 --> 29:12.623
Whatever can trigger the
behavior of the prisoners.

29:12.647 --> 29:17.145
Each intake is selected for their
resemblance to a victim profile.

29:17.169 --> 29:18.767
As Dr. Logan indicated,

29:18.791 --> 29:20.631
we dress them, we
style their hair.

29:20.655 --> 29:25.108
Sometimes, we even fix prosthetics
to trigger the proper responses.

29:26.592 --> 29:29.077
Check this out.

29:31.424 --> 29:35.784
Every single person in this room has
taken a shot of milk of amnesia.

29:35.808 --> 29:38.511
What we have here
is very unique.

29:38.535 --> 29:41.065
We have the ability
to tailor our victims

29:41.089 --> 29:42.998
right to the prisoner profiles,

29:43.022 --> 29:45.932
and get full accessibility to
their personality profiles,

29:45.956 --> 29:48.832
as well as brainwave mapping.

29:48.856 --> 29:50.903
Our inmates are studied

29:50.927 --> 29:53.077
on an almost cellular level.

29:53.101 --> 29:56.494
The information is
compiled into what will be

29:56.518 --> 30:00.143
the greatest criminal
database ever created.

30:01.351 --> 30:02.697
Let me show you.

30:03.594 --> 30:07.609
We have breast size, body type.

30:07.633 --> 30:10.405
We fit the victim
to the prisoner.

30:10.429 --> 30:13.328
And as you can see the
results are very impressive.

30:15.468 --> 30:17.999
Look, I know how this seems,

30:18.023 --> 30:19.921
but this really is a service.

30:20.577 --> 30:21.623
Okay?

30:21.647 --> 30:24.384
All these people out there...

30:24.408 --> 30:25.454
they would have died anyway.

30:25.478 --> 30:26.939
At least here,

30:26.963 --> 30:28.343
they get their 15 minutes.

30:29.620 --> 30:32.002
Assuming they live that long.

30:33.279 --> 30:35.464
Now, all jokes aside,

30:35.488 --> 30:37.087
I'm genuinely proud
of this staff

30:37.111 --> 30:39.089
of make-up artists
and designers.

30:39.113 --> 30:41.712
We should win a few Oscars
in all seriousness.

30:41.736 --> 30:43.541
Do you realize, our
set decorators work

30:43.565 --> 30:45.026
with computer
programmed designers,

30:45.050 --> 30:49.547
to recreate everything
down to the finest detail?

30:49.571 --> 30:51.297
We have a "night stand girl."

30:52.747 --> 30:53.862
That's right.

30:53.886 --> 30:55.899
One girl, one job,
dress night stands.

30:55.923 --> 30:57.107
She gets the perfect picture,

30:57.131 --> 30:58.902
the perfect lamps, the
perfect tissue boxes.

30:58.926 --> 31:02.733
Also, the setting looks as close

31:02.757 --> 31:04.631
to perfect as we can get.

31:04.655 --> 31:05.943
It was spot on.

31:05.967 --> 31:08.359
What about the ones
who aren't cast?

31:08.383 --> 31:09.809
Not my department.

31:09.833 --> 31:11.397
What happens to them?

31:11.421 --> 31:14.779
Well, they're routed to other areas
and used for other purposes.

31:14.803 --> 31:17.334
Nothing gets wasted here.

31:17.358 --> 31:21.510
Yeah, not everyone brought
in here is a victim.

31:21.534 --> 31:24.089
I mean, others are studied in...

31:26.712 --> 31:28.828
different ways.

31:28.852 --> 31:31.658
Anyway, before I bring you
back to Dr. Fletcher,

31:31.682 --> 31:33.971
there's three very interesting
guys I'd like you to meet.

31:33.995 --> 31:35.939
They're kind of my pet projects.

31:35.963 --> 31:38.251
Dr. Bennett, thank you so much.
This was wonderful.

31:38.275 --> 31:40.933
No, you're wonderful. Thank you.

31:41.692 --> 31:42.911
Erm.

31:42.935 --> 31:45.776
The, umm, homeless woman

31:45.800 --> 31:47.502
that was selected for
your Honor killing

31:47.526 --> 31:50.954
was done so because of her
resemblance to your mother.

31:50.978 --> 31:53.715
She fits Cal Ness's profile.

31:53.739 --> 31:55.510
Right.Yeah.

31:55.534 --> 31:56.811
All right, let's go.

31:57.087 --> 31:58.340
Novak!

31:58.364 --> 31:59.859
Don't cut the shirt.

31:59.883 --> 32:01.850
That's the only thing
holding him together.

32:05.475 --> 32:06.970
These

32:06.994 --> 32:09.386
are the three Satans.

32:09.410 --> 32:12.216
We found three prisoners
who hold delusions.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.977
That one is Satan,

32:14.001 --> 32:15.737
one created Satan,

32:15.761 --> 32:18.937
and one is the son of Satan.

32:19.834 --> 32:21.318
What are the chances of that?

32:22.423 --> 32:23.942
Pretty good, actually.

32:26.392 --> 32:27.462
You might be right.

32:29.016 --> 32:32.616
In any case, I borrowed a C.I.A.
playbook from the '60s,

32:32.640 --> 32:36.275
wondering if these
three held together,

32:36.299 --> 32:40.199
would somehow cancel each other
out and cure their delusions.

32:43.789 --> 32:44.963
And?

32:46.033 --> 32:47.803
They're still batshit crazy...

32:47.827 --> 32:49.633
for now.

32:49.657 --> 32:50.841
Hey, you wanna meet them?

32:50.865 --> 32:52.015
Yeah. It's perfectly safe

32:52.039 --> 32:54.041
and so entertaining.

32:54.938 --> 32:57.009
Come on, I love these guys.

33:01.462 --> 33:03.188
Princes of darkness...

33:04.154 --> 33:06.018
I brought you some visitors.

33:07.364 --> 33:10.688
These are special
Agents, Boon and Novak.

33:10.712 --> 33:13.105
They're undergoing
final training,

33:13.129 --> 33:15.165
and they wanted to meet you.

33:15.683 --> 33:17.167
I am Satan.

33:18.341 --> 33:21.102
My straight name is
Arthur Channing Brai.

33:22.379 --> 33:23.863
I created Satan.

33:25.175 --> 33:28.075
I have other names, but
they like this one.

33:29.490 --> 33:30.939
I am Satan.

33:32.286 --> 33:35.161
AKA Michael Devon.

33:35.185 --> 33:38.337
You might recall that
Mr. Devon renovated

33:38.361 --> 33:40.995
an entire three
storey home in Iowa,

33:41.019 --> 33:42.641
into a torture chamber.

33:45.747 --> 33:47.439
He's not Satan.

33:48.854 --> 33:50.545
Satan, 2.0 then?

33:52.547 --> 33:54.032
This handsome devil

33:55.378 --> 33:56.965
is Tyler Campian.

34:02.109 --> 34:04.570
The true son of Satan.

34:04.594 --> 34:06.434
Tyler had a promising career

34:06.458 --> 34:09.643
as an illusionist
and escape artist.

34:09.668 --> 34:11.463
Another David Blaine or Houdini.

34:13.154 --> 34:16.951
That all ended when he gutted...
his mother,

34:17.710 --> 34:18.987
his sister,

34:19.678 --> 34:21.197
and his grandfather.

34:22.129 --> 34:25.063
And stuffed them full
of rosary beads,

34:26.547 --> 34:29.308
before crucifying them
on a church yard.

34:33.036 --> 34:35.428
He then went on to

34:35.452 --> 34:38.706
kill a nursery of
infants of a hospital,

34:38.731 --> 34:40.561
in a search for the
"Christ child."

34:45.152 --> 34:47.947
No one knows how he
avoided detection.

34:48.983 --> 34:50.685
You took my mask.

34:50.708 --> 34:52.652
Mmm-hmm.

34:52.676 --> 34:57.094
He's talking about his mask he
used when he was a performer.

34:58.165 --> 35:00.098
And I'm going to keep it too,

35:01.099 --> 35:03.273
until you drop this one.

35:06.069 --> 35:07.312
If you're Satan,

35:09.107 --> 35:11.523
why don't you make those
restraints disappear?

35:15.320 --> 35:18.668
Much too vulgar a
display of power.

35:19.738 --> 35:21.981
Well played, I like that.

35:23.604 --> 35:25.053
I know who I am.

35:27.780 --> 35:29.230
I am Satan.

35:30.438 --> 35:32.130
The AntiChrist.

35:33.303 --> 35:34.408
The beast.

35:36.203 --> 35:40.138
And if I wasn't, I wouldn't lay
claim to anything of the sort.

35:41.932 --> 35:44.176
I know this house is insane.

35:48.939 --> 35:51.390
And I know that you
have to be careful.

35:51.977 --> 35:54.749
Oh, Mr. Devon, please.

35:54.773 --> 35:57.441
Your rash generalization that
everyone in an insane asylum

35:57.465 --> 36:00.479
is necessarily insane,
is highly insulting.

36:00.503 --> 36:04.023
There are people here
who are not insane.

36:05.197 --> 36:06.509
Those two aren't.

36:07.717 --> 36:09.236
Each person is a temple.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.341
Please respect that.

36:12.204 --> 36:14.068
It's not what you take with you,

36:15.621 --> 36:17.382
it's what you leave behind.

36:18.693 --> 36:19.601
Excuse me?

36:19.625 --> 36:20.982
Hell...

36:21.006 --> 36:22.352
isn't a word,

36:23.111 --> 36:25.228
it's a sentence.

36:25.252 --> 36:26.677
She has to understand
what's going on in here...

36:26.701 --> 36:29.566
I am Satan!

36:30.809 --> 36:32.027
The beast!

36:32.051 --> 36:34.778
And the Creator!

36:42.959 --> 36:44.409
If that's true,

36:45.582 --> 36:48.171
why do you think I brought
you all here together?

36:49.068 --> 36:50.691
Electronic voodoo?

36:52.106 --> 36:53.383
Brainwashing?

36:55.109 --> 36:56.742
You really should be
more inquisitive as to

36:56.766 --> 36:58.388
why these two were brought here.

36:59.803 --> 37:01.460
You think they're on your side.

37:03.945 --> 37:06.855
Isn't the devil a
master of lies?

37:06.879 --> 37:09.064
You fucking bitch!

37:09.088 --> 37:10.549
You took my mask!

37:12.264 --> 37:14.232
You... You fu...

37:16.130 --> 37:17.614
Solitary!

37:27.417 --> 37:30.465
Going down. Ninth level.

37:30.489 --> 37:32.743
There are some
specific personalities

37:32.767 --> 37:35.470
dangerous to a healthy society.

37:35.494 --> 37:39.750
The passive individual, the one who's
afraid to say what they think.

37:39.774 --> 37:43.375
They stand for everything
and they stand for nothing.

37:43.399 --> 37:47.068
Like the bureaucrats
behind the holocaust.

37:47.092 --> 37:51.175
They personified the
banality of evil

37:51.199 --> 37:53.454
that exterminated millions.

37:53.478 --> 37:56.077
There is a possessive type.

37:56.101 --> 37:59.632
Filled with jealousy,
demanding loyalty.

37:59.656 --> 38:04.258
This type, poses a direct
threat to children.

38:04.282 --> 38:07.699
We're getting an electronic
signal inside of him.

38:10.046 --> 38:11.920
The insecure ones,

38:11.944 --> 38:14.268
mediocrity is their standard.

38:14.292 --> 38:17.063
Afraid to live,
scared to die, they

38:17.087 --> 38:19.514
lived by the
dictates of society.

38:19.538 --> 38:23.069
And they're dangerous
for their need and lust

38:23.093 --> 38:24.795
to have authority over them.

38:25.993 --> 38:27.936
What did they do?

38:27.960 --> 38:29.869
Did they shove his
radio up his ass?

38:29.893 --> 38:32.078
The last type is a psychopath.

38:32.102 --> 38:33.873
This type is the most dangerous

38:33.897 --> 38:37.498
during times of social
and political upheaval.

38:37.522 --> 38:40.224
I think I've got whatever it is.

38:40.248 --> 38:42.710
Here it comes. Here it comes!
Here it comes!

38:52.364 --> 38:54.480
60 minutes auxiliary power.

38:54.504 --> 38:57.335
Containment cell breach.
Red alert.

38:58.266 --> 39:00.210
60 minutes auxiliary power.

39:00.234 --> 39:02.616
Containment cell breach.
Red alert.

39:03.893 --> 39:06.043
60 minutes auxiliary power.

39:06.067 --> 39:08.346
No, main line is all we got.

39:09.588 --> 39:11.048
Fuck no!

39:11.072 --> 39:13.775
We expect EMP's from outside.

39:13.799 --> 39:15.225
We're on batteries.

39:15.249 --> 39:17.527
Facility-wide power outage.

39:18.597 --> 39:20.403
How do you know that?

39:20.427 --> 39:23.326
When that light comes on,
we're in total blackout.

39:24.189 --> 39:25.649
A power failure?

39:25.673 --> 39:28.238
A place like this can have
a fucking power failure?

39:28.262 --> 39:29.712
We were shut down.

39:30.713 --> 39:32.415
By whom?

39:32.439 --> 39:34.441
I think we stopped
below level four.

39:36.063 --> 39:37.547
Are your phones working?

39:39.722 --> 39:40.723
Nope.

39:42.138 --> 39:44.830
- Containment cell breach.
- Red alert.

39:49.904 --> 39:51.710
We need

39:51.734 --> 39:57.371
to get this piece of
shit back into storage.

39:57.395 --> 40:00.915
How do we detach him
from this shit?

40:02.227 --> 40:04.643
Containment cell breach.
Red alert.

40:05.472 --> 40:06.714
Can't that kill him?

40:17.380 --> 40:20.290
Containment cell breach.
Red alert.

40:20.314 --> 40:21.971
Vacate premises.

40:29.599 --> 40:32.475
You guys didn't plan on
anything like this happening?

40:32.499 --> 40:35.616
Agent Novak,

40:35.640 --> 40:39.861
in 1997, the military
built a stealth bomber

40:39.885 --> 40:43.796
for two billion that
couldn't fly in the rain.

40:43.820 --> 40:47.317
This facility was a
record 3.2 billion

40:47.341 --> 40:50.044
and cost 5 million a
year to maintain,

40:50.068 --> 40:53.254
so, yes, we have a few flaws.

40:53.278 --> 40:55.118
This place has to be like NORAD.

40:55.142 --> 40:58.639
So far down that an external
EMP hit wouldn't do anything.

40:58.663 --> 40:59.950
Shield it.

40:59.974 --> 41:03.540
Well, apparently, no one
thought of an interior attack.

41:03.564 --> 41:05.083
What's the exit strategy?

41:07.188 --> 41:10.858
Well, we have an hour of
battery with generator backup,

41:10.882 --> 41:15.552
but we're not moving and I don't
hear the generators, so...

41:15.576 --> 41:17.968
Why isn't the
elevator on backup?

41:17.992 --> 41:23.284
In a situation like this, all
the focus is on containment.

41:23.308 --> 41:26.183
If we lose all the power,
the shields go down,

41:26.207 --> 41:30.394
the gas stops and everyone
comes out of their fog.

41:30.418 --> 41:32.569
Well, then, there should
be a kill switch.

41:32.593 --> 41:35.192
I mean, you've got gas
flowing everywhere.

41:35.216 --> 41:36.677
Don't you have something
special lined up

41:36.701 --> 41:38.610
to kill everybody inside
this fucking hellhole,

41:38.634 --> 41:40.750
in case there's a
doomsday scenario?

41:40.774 --> 41:42.890
We have one.

41:42.914 --> 41:45.893
But we're pretty insulated
in here for right now.

41:45.917 --> 41:49.241
They'll be looking for
an escape, not for us.

41:49.265 --> 41:50.587
The ones below are
going to decide

41:50.611 --> 41:52.889
that this shaft is a
shortcut to the top.

41:55.029 --> 41:56.548
What about the five evils?

42:13.047 --> 42:15.405
When we get power back on,

42:15.429 --> 42:17.407
we'll get you to a medic,

42:17.431 --> 42:19.157
and get those taken out.

42:24.749 --> 42:27.510
Are you just going to stand there?
Help me.

42:58.265 --> 43:01.613
Jesus Christ, is that below us?

43:05.168 --> 43:07.630
A design flaw got us in here,

43:07.654 --> 43:09.597
there's gotta be
one to get us out,

43:09.621 --> 43:12.635
if not, we get to
the kill switch.

43:12.659 --> 43:14.291
We have a two man rule

43:14.315 --> 43:18.054
to prevent any single person
from activating the death gas.

43:18.078 --> 43:20.332
If power isn't restored
within the hour,

43:20.356 --> 43:25.475
the commanding officer will order
two officers to activate the gas.

43:25.499 --> 43:27.777
The ninth level is different.

43:40.618 --> 43:43.113
The gas doesn't reach that far?

43:43.137 --> 43:45.726
It reaches... it won't work.

43:49.799 --> 43:51.629
Facility sealed.

43:54.908 --> 43:56.564
Facility sealed.

43:59.947 --> 44:01.190
Facility sealed.

44:22.625 --> 44:23.902
Fucking die!

44:24.800 --> 44:27.123
Containment force
shield breach imminent.

44:27.147 --> 44:29.114
All staff vacate premises.

44:30.702 --> 44:33.232
Containment for shield
breach imminent.

44:33.256 --> 44:35.086
All staff vacate premises.

44:36.466 --> 44:38.952
Shock one... Tango.

45:16.058 --> 45:17.887
Where the hell is the gas?

45:24.825 --> 45:28.001
That's it. Here we go people.

45:40.841 --> 45:43.948
Can't see them. Where
the fuck are they?

45:51.024 --> 45:52.301
Deploy shields.

47:27.292 --> 47:29.812
Yeah, yeah!

47:31.710 --> 47:33.022
They're out.

47:48.486 --> 47:49.728
Listen.

47:52.766 --> 47:54.285
Listen to me.

49:19.922 --> 49:23.443
So, would anybody
else like to try?

49:25.790 --> 49:27.585
Huh? Anyone?

49:29.621 --> 49:30.968
I didn't think so.

49:34.385 --> 49:38.779
We all know what lies at
the bottom of this place.

49:38.803 --> 49:42.048
We all know "they"
are down there.

49:43.670 --> 49:45.603
The way out is not that way.

49:46.604 --> 49:49.296
It's down, to them

49:50.642 --> 49:51.850
with me.

50:05.899 --> 50:07.211
I'm new here.

50:08.591 --> 50:09.972
Fresh fish.

50:10.938 --> 50:12.468
Isn't there a rule about

50:12.492 --> 50:15.426
taking on the biggest guy in
the prison to send a message?

50:28.611 --> 50:30.303
I will follow you to hell.

50:31.200 --> 50:33.202
Just the place I'm going.

50:46.250 --> 50:48.262
Come with me if
you want to live.

50:48.286 --> 50:50.575
Do you ever take
your job seriously?

50:50.599 --> 50:53.716
Oh, come on, I gotta lighten
the mood a little bit.

50:55.121 --> 50:56.605
Dr. Fletcher...

50:59.056 --> 51:01.413
Great. Pull. Pull.

51:01.437 --> 51:03.543
Thank you.

51:10.653 --> 51:11.653
Well...

51:13.070 --> 51:14.485
Only two lights here.

51:15.451 --> 51:18.005
That, and them.

51:23.114 --> 51:26.290
Oh, and this.

51:39.372 --> 51:41.764
You better know your
way around this place.

51:45.895 --> 51:47.104
What am I looking for?

51:47.932 --> 51:49.140
Doors.

51:49.934 --> 51:51.177
Thanks.

52:00.117 --> 52:03.292
I highly doubt we're going to
be better off on any floor.

52:53.377 --> 52:55.689
If they see him, we're done.

52:58.899 --> 53:00.946
Whoo-hoo! Here's Johnny!

53:03.663 --> 53:05.710
Don't worry, we're going
to have fun right now.

53:05.734 --> 53:07.114
Come here, little guy.

53:10.187 --> 53:12.165
Damn it, you smell good.
What is that lavender?

53:12.189 --> 53:14.236
Goddamn, you smell...

53:14.260 --> 53:16.376
Up kitty!

53:20.542 --> 53:22.199
So cute when you're mad.

53:34.763 --> 53:36.775
Oh, yeah.

53:36.799 --> 53:38.777
Well, the harder you fight me,

53:38.801 --> 53:40.803
the harder I get.

53:41.252 --> 53:42.850
My turn, bitch.

53:45.083 --> 53:46.129
Whoo!

53:46.153 --> 53:48.708
I'm tellin' you, I
think I'm in love.

53:50.157 --> 53:52.090
I know you felt it too.

53:52.815 --> 53:53.861
You special.

53:53.885 --> 53:55.863
I'm not sharing you with nobody.

53:55.887 --> 53:57.969
I don't care how
many secrets I get.

53:57.993 --> 54:02.284
Don't go looking in my room, with my own
comfort. You ain't going nowhere, bitch.

54:02.308 --> 54:04.389
Come on! You fuckin' want it?

54:04.413 --> 54:07.012
You want it, too? You'll
get it motherfucker!

54:07.036 --> 54:09.246
I'm going take these
fucking pants off.

54:16.114 --> 54:19.256
I'm gonna fuck you so hard.

54:29.093 --> 54:31.589
- Oh, God.
- Check these bodies.

54:31.613 --> 54:33.176
Flashlights, guns...

54:33.200 --> 54:34.799
You think the
batteries will work.

54:34.823 --> 54:36.076
They should.

54:36.100 --> 54:37.767
I can't see anything.

54:37.791 --> 54:39.493
Oh, my God.

54:39.517 --> 54:40.770
Shit!

54:40.794 --> 54:43.154
Oh, my God! AGENT NOVAK: How
many inmates are on this level?

54:43.487 --> 54:45.568
39 after him.

54:45.592 --> 54:48.295
But maybe less. It's
so hard to tell.

54:48.319 --> 54:50.839
But there're labs we
can use for shelter.

54:52.116 --> 54:53.290
Shelter?

54:54.739 --> 54:56.879
We gotta find a way up...
AGENT BOON: Shh!

55:03.438 --> 55:05.716
We forgot to close
the elevator shaft.

55:08.650 --> 55:09.903
Fucking run!

55:09.927 --> 55:11.308
Go!

55:17.659 --> 55:18.729
Run!

55:26.875 --> 55:28.325
You want penetration?

55:31.638 --> 55:32.708
Move!

55:38.024 --> 55:39.439
Listen to me.

55:40.578 --> 55:43.201
Listen. AGENT BOON: Oh, God!

55:52.314 --> 55:53.626
Clear.

56:01.565 --> 56:03.877
We gotta stop.DR.
FLETCHER: Go on.

56:12.610 --> 56:17.315
Okay, the stairs
go to more cells.

56:17.339 --> 56:20.756
This way leads to the
experimental chambers.

56:23.414 --> 56:25.254
What's the difference?

56:25.278 --> 56:28.809
DR. Less run-ins. AGENT
BOON: Where are the guards?

56:28.833 --> 56:31.733
Alive or dead? AGENT NOVAK:
They fuckin' ate 'em.

56:45.298 --> 56:46.989
They're going to BE on us soon.

56:49.682 --> 56:50.924
You know something?

56:51.511 --> 56:53.686
I know everything, Novak.

56:56.620 --> 56:58.311
Get it together.

57:04.006 --> 57:05.491
Christ.

57:11.773 --> 57:15.742
Come down and eat with us.

57:18.262 --> 57:20.816
Let's go. Move it! Move it! Go!

57:38.524 --> 57:39.870
What the fuck?

57:53.331 --> 57:54.678
Where? There.

57:55.541 --> 57:57.025
Okay, we're going in.

57:57.888 --> 57:59.452
We have no choice.

57:59.476 --> 58:01.339
Novak, get the door!

58:13.593 --> 58:17.055
Keep the lights low.
Stay by this door.

58:17.079 --> 58:18.495
I know this cell.

58:22.878 --> 58:26.271
We no longer wish to be here.

58:26.295 --> 58:28.619
Are we alone?

58:28.643 --> 58:31.922
Don't come closer, or I'll
take you out of here.

58:35.581 --> 58:37.479
There should be nine of them.

58:39.343 --> 58:41.355
Nine of what?

58:41.379 --> 58:43.910
Prisoners and homeless.

58:43.934 --> 58:46.868
We have yet to explain
what happened in here.

58:47.938 --> 58:49.571
Fuck that.

58:49.595 --> 58:50.941
Novak!

59:26.632 --> 59:32.741
We no longer wish to be freed.

59:34.329 --> 59:35.848
How are they still alive?

59:37.194 --> 59:38.447
We don't know.

59:46.686 --> 59:51.139
We stay in here until they've
lost interest out there.

01:00:02.081 --> 01:00:03.738
Redmane!

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:06.775
Stop.

01:00:09.122 --> 01:00:10.158
Wait here.

01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:34.803
So many things I
want to do to you.

01:00:41.258 --> 01:00:42.639
There's no time.

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:46.194
Like rape and kill me?

01:00:47.851 --> 01:00:48.921
Very original.

01:00:51.855 --> 01:00:55.065
You really are a legend
in your own mind, Doctor.

01:01:07.767 --> 01:01:10.943
Is this the third one?
REDMANE: Yeah.

01:01:12.289 --> 01:01:13.739
He's the one you want.

01:01:14.532 --> 01:01:15.741
Get up.

01:01:16.431 --> 01:01:17.950
Here's his mask.

01:01:21.367 --> 01:01:22.575
Hmm.

01:02:04.859 --> 01:02:09.494
We no longer wish to be freed.
We can't just sit here.

01:02:09.518 --> 01:02:11.013
We need to get out of here.

01:02:11.037 --> 01:02:12.176
Clear the door.

01:02:13.902 --> 01:02:14.938
Clear.

01:02:16.802 --> 01:02:18.838
You sure you can do this?

01:02:20.598 --> 01:02:22.117
You've earned your mask.

01:02:27.088 --> 01:02:30.160
Homeless, kept in storage.

01:02:34.198 --> 01:02:36.304
What does this have to
do with the kill switch?

01:02:46.107 --> 01:02:48.292
The kill switch is a gas

01:02:48.316 --> 01:02:51.329
that disables the
immune systems,

01:02:51.353 --> 01:02:54.943
allowing your own body's
bacteria to eat you alive

01:02:55.564 --> 01:02:56.945
which results in this.

01:02:57.601 --> 01:03:00.200
No human remains.

01:03:00.224 --> 01:03:02.893
Why does this only
happen to some of them?

01:03:02.917 --> 01:03:04.653
If we can target one,

01:03:04.677 --> 01:03:06.783
We can target the
whole facility.

01:03:11.408 --> 01:03:12.754
Even through intake?

01:03:21.245 --> 01:03:24.697
Whoo!

01:03:30.979 --> 01:03:33.095
All in the name of science.

01:03:34.362 --> 01:03:37.306
How are we going to get them up there?
No power.

01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:39.816
Hook 'em anyway. We'll
string 'em by hand.

01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:52.563
No drugs for you.

01:03:52.587 --> 01:03:54.313
You get the full experience.

01:04:47.745 --> 01:04:49.023
There.

01:05:01.621 --> 01:05:03.347
We got us a lab coat.

01:05:21.572 --> 01:05:22.919
What about the others?

01:05:24.437 --> 01:05:25.552
Fuck 'em.

01:05:25.576 --> 01:05:27.589
We got somewhere to be.

01:05:27.613 --> 01:05:31.662
Freedom. Freedom!

01:05:45.079 --> 01:05:47.529
She's coming. She's gone.

01:05:48.875 --> 01:05:50.498
We gotta see.

01:05:52.258 --> 01:05:53.984
I think they're
going down in them.

01:06:03.718 --> 01:06:05.064
Dr. Fletcher?

01:06:07.515 --> 01:06:08.930
Dr. Fletcher...

01:06:09.551 --> 01:06:10.967
The kill switch?

01:06:13.072 --> 01:06:15.937
DR. Ask them. AGENT
BOON: Ask who?

01:06:17.456 --> 01:06:20.390
No, no!

01:06:40.893 --> 01:06:42.308
Come on, get up.

01:07:39.814 --> 01:07:42.058
They're opening the side doors.

01:07:43.507 --> 01:07:45.899
Only way up is down.
Is this your plan?

01:07:45.923 --> 01:07:49.041
Free fall, drop to the bottom?
Drop and shoot.

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:50.652
Is that the best you got?

01:07:52.033 --> 01:07:53.517
Get your hand wrapped up.

01:08:42.532 --> 01:08:44.268
Hey... It's okay.

01:08:44.292 --> 01:08:46.374
It's bad. Oh, shit.

01:08:46.398 --> 01:08:48.640
Fuck it, I'm fine. I'm fine.
All right.

01:08:52.024 --> 01:08:53.715
What do we do when
we get to them?

01:08:57.098 --> 01:08:59.064
I don't think they're
capable of mercy.

01:09:31.787 --> 01:09:33.169
There they are.

01:09:34.238 --> 01:09:35.723
They're right there.

01:09:38.828 --> 01:09:40.245
Let's go.

01:11:06.434 --> 01:11:07.677
I am God,

01:11:08.609 --> 01:11:10.369
the great and terrible.

01:11:24.901 --> 01:11:26.603
Stay with me.

01:11:26.627 --> 01:11:28.180
We're almost there.

01:12:01.938 --> 01:12:03.388
Not that easy.

01:12:06.114 --> 01:12:07.771
You've come for us.

01:12:09.497 --> 01:12:12.604
We have always been with you.

01:12:16.297 --> 01:12:17.609
What do you want?

01:12:20.025 --> 01:12:21.716
We want to get the
fuck out of here.

01:12:26.203 --> 01:12:27.964
Figured you were our best bet.

01:12:28.930 --> 01:12:30.449
Why didn't you just pray?

01:12:33.970 --> 01:12:35.765
Do not pray to us.

01:12:38.975 --> 01:12:41.402
Do you believe

01:12:41.426 --> 01:12:45.533
that we give you a better
chance at being saved than God?

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:52.989
You shot yourself.

01:12:54.093 --> 01:12:55.647
You freed me.

01:12:59.789 --> 01:13:01.722
God is a supreme sadist.

01:13:02.688 --> 01:13:04.977
Evil is God's lie

01:13:05.001 --> 01:13:08.729
to maintain slavish
obedience and conformity.

01:13:10.316 --> 01:13:13.572
We are the messengers of freedom

01:13:13.596 --> 01:13:18.394
from a vain, selfish,
irrational God.

01:13:20.326 --> 01:13:25.169
You have no idea, the
atrocities you committed.

01:13:25.193 --> 01:13:28.645
Only they would wipe them
with their programs.

01:13:29.266 --> 01:13:31.175
They trained you.

01:13:31.199 --> 01:13:34.755
They made you into their slaves.

01:13:36.135 --> 01:13:39.276
We are here to free you.

01:13:39.898 --> 01:13:44.005
You are here to free us.

01:13:47.353 --> 01:13:49.953
I never saw you. But you have.

01:13:49.977 --> 01:13:53.474
They selected the
memories that you carry.

01:13:53.498 --> 01:13:57.339
We let you see through the fog.

01:13:57.363 --> 01:13:59.504
You're part of a
brave new world now.

01:14:00.297 --> 01:14:01.713
There is no evil.

01:14:03.024 --> 01:14:04.933
Evil faces extinction.

01:14:04.957 --> 01:14:06.511
Well, what about him?

01:14:08.685 --> 01:14:10.584
We just gave him
what he asked for.

01:14:12.033 --> 01:14:13.449
He wanted you to know.

01:14:30.983 --> 01:14:32.364
Read...

01:14:34.124 --> 01:14:35.609
Tell us what you see.

01:14:56.215 --> 01:14:57.527
Take me.

01:15:25.486 --> 01:15:27.868
I will see you soon.

01:15:37.049 --> 01:15:40.408
What you see in this facility
is not contained here.

01:15:40.432 --> 01:15:43.100
There are other Death Houses.

01:15:43.124 --> 01:15:44.988
They threaten both
good and evil.

01:15:47.128 --> 01:15:48.381
How?

01:15:48.405 --> 01:15:50.487
Technology is the new God.

01:15:50.511 --> 01:15:52.696
Software is the new dogma.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:55.043
Their using it to try
and create a race.

01:15:55.067 --> 01:15:57.287
It is neither good nor evil.

01:15:57.311 --> 01:15:59.416
It will just be.

01:16:00.279 --> 01:16:01.833
The world needs us.

01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:05.502
We need to be freed into it.

01:16:05.526 --> 01:16:07.493
You need to pursue us.

01:16:08.736 --> 01:16:11.428
Every killer secretly
wants to be caught.

01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:15.156
Without us, there is no evil.

01:16:16.330 --> 01:16:19.436
Without evil there is no good.

01:16:20.092 --> 01:16:24.131
True hell is nothingness.

01:16:26.547 --> 01:16:27.755
Stay.

01:17:07.415 --> 01:17:09.601
We were imprisoned here,

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:13.121
because we are a threat to
the likes of Dr. Fletcher.

01:17:13.145 --> 01:17:17.574
People who think that humans can
be transcended above their flaws,

01:17:17.598 --> 01:17:19.082
above good and evil.

01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:22.741
The universe was not
designed for that.

01:17:24.536 --> 01:17:28.447
My crimes have never
been deemed acceptable.

01:17:28.471 --> 01:17:30.691
Yet, what you saw out there,

01:17:30.715 --> 01:17:33.314
children being used and abused

01:17:33.338 --> 01:17:35.454
for the sake of progress

01:17:35.478 --> 01:17:37.929
that transcends evil,

01:17:38.412 --> 01:17:41.587
disguised as good.

01:17:44.763 --> 01:17:45.868
Sieg.

01:17:51.011 --> 01:17:52.668
You know my name.

01:17:58.604 --> 01:18:00.582
I followed all of you.

01:18:00.606 --> 01:18:04.576
I've connected with what
has made you immortal.

01:18:07.372 --> 01:18:10.006
I've had communion with the power...
I've studied.

01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:11.238
You followed!

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:14.690
Yes, everything.

01:18:16.726 --> 01:18:18.107
Now, I'm one of you.

01:18:21.144 --> 01:18:22.249
You hear that?

01:18:23.975 --> 01:18:25.286
I brought them here.

01:18:26.529 --> 01:18:28.541
They followed me here,

01:18:28.565 --> 01:18:31.475
knowing how long you've
been imprisoned.

01:18:31.499 --> 01:18:33.546
You were always a
part of our plan.

01:18:33.570 --> 01:18:34.848
What plan?

01:18:35.365 --> 01:18:37.550
Our escape plan.

01:18:37.574 --> 01:18:39.345
I am your servant.

01:18:39.369 --> 01:18:41.130
I've learnt so much.

01:18:41.924 --> 01:18:43.235
We know you.

01:18:45.686 --> 01:18:47.930
We studied you while we slept.

01:18:50.311 --> 01:18:51.727
You disgust us.

01:18:52.486 --> 01:18:55.465
Listen. Listen to me!

01:18:55.489 --> 01:18:58.595
I am immortal.

01:18:59.079 --> 01:19:00.149
Really?

01:20:02.314 --> 01:20:03.315
See?

01:21:21.497 --> 01:21:23.578
A clean slate...

01:21:23.602 --> 01:21:25.363
free from original sin.

01:21:27.606 --> 01:21:28.987
Welcome to the world, boy.

01:21:36.684 --> 01:21:38.904
VOICE OVER P.A
Facility back online.

01:21:38.928 --> 01:21:40.343
Novak?

01:21:56.049 --> 01:21:57.153
What now?

01:22:02.469 --> 01:22:03.884
We go find him.

01:22:05.334 --> 01:22:06.542
Bring him back.

01:22:10.373 --> 01:22:11.857
We reboot the game.

01:22:13.652 --> 01:22:15.344
We don't even know what we are.

01:22:16.517 --> 01:22:17.829
Who we are...

01:22:21.729 --> 01:22:23.179
Let's go find out.

01:22:39.333 --> 01:22:41.059
Work to do.

01:22:43.889 --> 01:22:45.477
What's your name, sweety?

01:22:47.893 --> 01:22:50.482
My name is Linz.Linz.

01:22:52.277 --> 01:22:56.178
Well, Linz, welcome to the farm.

01:24:20.779 --> 01:24:22.792
Hey, Hana, I got the stuff.

01:24:22.816 --> 01:24:24.932
Oh, shit. I got the wrong box.

01:24:24.956 --> 01:24:26.313
All I got was this mask.

01:24:26.337 --> 01:24:27.452
Can you use this?
