00:21.421 --> 00:23.455
(BEEPING)

00:23.790 --> 00:25.057
SUPERMAN:
Where's the meteor headed?

00:25.092 --> 00:28.026
Present course,
downtown Bludhaven.

00:28.061 --> 00:29.594
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

00:29.629 --> 00:31.563
Hmm. Powerful.

00:31.598 --> 00:33.999
More powerful
than a potential disaster?

00:34.034 --> 00:36.601
In case you hadn't noticed,
we have a situation here.

00:36.636 --> 00:39.671
Any of you three
can handle an ordinary meteor.

00:39.706 --> 00:43.008
The energy contained
in this artifact
is astronomical.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.545
A single missing component
is key to unlocking
its true power.

00:47.180 --> 00:50.315
Speaking of power,
why isn't this meteor
burning up?

00:50.350 --> 00:54.319
WONDER WOMAN:
A better question would be,
why is it changing course?

00:55.722 --> 00:57.356
It's headed straight for us.

00:59.493 --> 01:02.794
I knew a day
alone in the lab was
too good to be true.

01:02.829 --> 01:04.463
(FIRE ROARING)

01:04.498 --> 01:06.231
Yee-haw!

01:07.501 --> 01:08.801
(ENGINE WHIRRING)

01:09.669 --> 01:11.670
Time to get what's mine.

01:12.439 --> 01:13.605
(ZAPPING)

01:14.241 --> 01:17.443
Trash day is Tuesday,
so you can't hang around here.

01:18.178 --> 01:19.578
(CRASHING)

01:21.181 --> 01:22.214
(BLOWS)

01:22.816 --> 01:24.283
Not very neighborly.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.420
I'll teach you some manners.

01:29.589 --> 01:30.789
(EXPLOSION)

01:31.825 --> 01:32.891
Huh?

01:32.926 --> 01:34.560
You need to calm yourself.

01:35.395 --> 01:37.963
But I'm just
warming up, precious.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.232
(THUDS)

01:42.936 --> 01:43.969
Huh?

01:44.671 --> 01:47.206
If you're looking for trouble,
you've found it.

01:48.241 --> 01:52.144
Chill, superdudes
and princess sparklerope.

01:52.179 --> 01:53.579
Ooh. Cool band name.

01:54.247 --> 01:59.050
Anyway, I'm not here
to rumble, I'm here for...
Oh, what you call it?

01:59.085 --> 02:00.519
Sanctuary.

02:02.255 --> 02:06.424
Don't exactly pull out
the welcome wagon
for your guests, do you?

02:06.459 --> 02:07.926
Depends on the guest.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.528
Tell us why
you need sanctuary.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.196
And from who.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.232
BATMAN: I think
we're about to find out.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.766
(BEEPING)

02:19.239 --> 02:20.272
Huh?

02:21.274 --> 02:22.941

02:23.610 --> 02:24.910
(GROWLS)

02:24.945 --> 02:26.011
(GRUNTS)

02:26.379 --> 02:28.780
I don't think they're
here to sell cookies.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.849
Diana and I will find out
what our guests want

02:30.884 --> 02:32.784
while you two
keep an eye on Lobo.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.219
(BANGING)

02:34.254 --> 02:38.423
Can I get a cucumber
water or something?
I'm super parched.

02:40.393 --> 02:41.593
Be on guard.

02:41.628 --> 02:44.296
These Red Lanterns
can be a bit touchy.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.166
(BEEPING)

02:48.935 --> 02:50.035
Ambush!

02:51.738 --> 02:52.771

ATROCITUS: Whoa, Zilius!

03:00.413 --> 03:03.048
No. I demand vengeance.

03:03.483 --> 03:04.550
(GROWLS)

03:05.786 --> 03:09.655
Soon.
Vengeance soon. I can wait.
No problem, master.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.091
I require
the bounty hunter Lobo.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.392
For what reason?

03:14.427 --> 03:18.130
He stole three
newly forged
red lantern rings.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.334
Please, give us a moment
to find your rings.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.468
We'll be right back.

03:25.171 --> 03:26.270
(YELLS)

03:26.306 --> 03:29.407
Why are we waiting outside
like common fruit vendors

03:29.442 --> 03:31.576
instead of scorching
them to cinders?

03:31.611 --> 03:37.082
Because I would have them
relax their guard until
Dex-Starr lets us inside.

03:37.117 --> 03:41.320
Then we will take
our rings and destroy
any who stand in our way.

03:42.088 --> 03:48.193
Your deviousness inspires me
once more, master.
I never had a doubt!

03:48.228 --> 03:49.861
Unlike these two fools.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.430

03:55.935 --> 03:58.603
Hey! Personal space,
metal mitts!

03:58.638 --> 04:00.071
The rings aren't here.

04:00.106 --> 04:01.973
Doesn't mean
he didn't steal them.

04:02.008 --> 04:06.478
That's a bunch of crud.
Why would I?
They aren't worth squat.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.015
It's true. No one can
use a lantern ring
unless they're chosen.

04:10.050 --> 04:14.452
But it wouldn't be the first
time a dull-witted criminal
has done something stupid.

04:14.487 --> 04:16.288
Hey! I'm right here.

04:42.615 --> 04:43.882
Good kitty.

04:44.417 --> 04:46.651
Is it wrong not to want
that guy in here?

04:46.686 --> 04:48.820
Even if the Red Lanterns
will take him apart.

04:48.855 --> 04:50.088
(CLICKING)

04:51.958 --> 04:55.527
BATMAN: If you read
his record, Lobo has done
some terrible things.

04:55.562 --> 04:56.862
(WHISTLING)

04:56.897 --> 04:59.964
Giving him to
the Red Lanterns for something
he didn't do this time

04:59.999 --> 05:03.868
may not be our justice,
but it is justice.

05:03.903 --> 05:06.271
We can't.
They'll execute him.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.840
LOBO: Look out,
my hero friends!

05:08.875 --> 05:10.809
The bad guys are here!

05:15.048 --> 05:18.216
Oh, come on.
We've got to upgrade security.

05:18.251 --> 05:21.520
Atrocitus, we are getting
to the bottom of this.
You have my word.

05:22.455 --> 05:26.091
And what exactly
is your word worth,
Kryptonian?

05:26.659 --> 05:28.794
Well, how'd those get there?

05:29.295 --> 05:31.730
Ooh, you guys
are in trouble!

05:32.632 --> 05:36.468
They've been working
with the thief all this time.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.703
Atrocitus, we did not
take those rings.

05:38.738 --> 05:41.539
We didn't even know
they were here until now.

05:41.574 --> 05:46.078
Come on, Justice chumps.
Let's kick some
Red Lantern butt!

06:15.675 --> 06:19.277
Yeah! Thanks for the spider
gauntlet, super saps.

06:19.679 --> 06:22.013
I've been looking
for it everywhere.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.850

is the key.

Atrocitus, we need
to join forces on this.

08:13.693 --> 08:16.628
I hate you and yours,
Kryptonian.

08:17.697 --> 08:21.232
But for today, only a fool
fights in a burning house.

I describe this new idea.

How do you do it?

Let's not be left out
of Lobo's destruction.

08:42.689 --> 08:43.755
Agreed.

Hmm?

If there's one scratch
on my Spacehog,
when I come get it...

Give it a rest,

We have a secure prison

Lobo won't be causing

for his crimes.

As you provided the edge

Where were you then, Zilius?

Er... Let's not get into
who was where.

I wouldn't want you
to be angry at the others

What I meant to say was,
great decision, master!
You're three for three today.

I prefer working alone.

10:49.716 --> 10:50.948
