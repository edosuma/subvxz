00:02.847 --> 00:04.806
I'm just starting the process
of changing my name.

00:04.806 --> 00:06.515
-I just got divorced.
-Oh. Bummer.

00:06.515 --> 00:07.348
Not really.

00:08.098 --> 00:09.847
This is to celebrate
your papers being signed,

00:09.847 --> 00:12.056
and for me officially
investing in the gallery.

00:12.056 --> 00:14.056
Thank you, but it's a loan.
I'm paying you back.

00:15.056 --> 00:17.014
You're single.
You're a free man.

00:17.014 --> 00:19.223
So that would be implying
that I'm getting laid a lot.

00:20.515 --> 00:22.098
No. No, that's not happening.

00:23.681 --> 00:25.722
DIANE: Francis,
I would like you to meet Andrew.

00:25.722 --> 00:27.139
Now that you're single,
are you swiping?

00:27.139 --> 00:28.431
I haven't taken the plunge yet.

00:28.431 --> 00:30.556
Well, don't start,
because you're clearly a mess.

00:30.556 --> 00:31.889
-Walking disaster.

00:32.431 --> 00:35.556
Feel like I got sole custody
of Lila's inner bitch.

00:35.556 --> 00:38.098
You're changing your name?
Fuck you!

00:38.306 --> 00:39.223
Fuck you!

00:54.847 --> 00:59.348

01:39.139 --> 01:42.889
I appreciate this Robert,
coming here after work.

01:42.889 --> 01:45.597
Your dream of
a professional-grade
pizza oven

01:45.597 --> 01:49.722
is my dream of
a professional-grade
pizza oven.

01:49.722 --> 01:53.597
I just had no idea
how much pleasure
it would bring me

01:53.597 --> 01:56.056
just to
braise a loin,

01:56.056 --> 01:59.139
supreme
a grapefruit.

01:59.139 --> 02:00.597
I hear ya.

02:00.597 --> 02:03.639
I can't believe
how much I'm digging
this physical labor.

02:03.639 --> 02:05.473
- Oh, yeah.

02:05.473 --> 02:08.139
I mean,
it's just short-term,
make some money.

02:08.139 --> 02:11.306
But there's something about
building with your own hands,

02:11.306 --> 02:14.014
coming home soaked
in your own sweat.

02:14.014 --> 02:16.390
I mean,
check out these traps.

02:16.390 --> 02:18.764
- That's impressive.
- Thanks.

02:20.973 --> 02:23.681
- I'm fine.

02:23.681 --> 02:25.973
Your heart's not gonna
attack you again, is it?

02:25.973 --> 02:27.681
No, no.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.348
I just...

02:34.639 --> 02:36.515
I've been
a terrible friend.

02:36.515 --> 02:39.597
I've treated you in
a condescending manner.

02:39.597 --> 02:41.806
I've belittled you
at times.

02:41.806 --> 02:45.722
To be honest,
I've been a real
goddamn shit.

02:45.722 --> 02:49.556
I don't know,
I just thought
you were being you--

02:49.556 --> 02:50.847
a dick.

02:50.847 --> 02:52.348
That's not me,
though.

02:52.348 --> 02:53.556
That's
what I realized.

02:53.556 --> 02:55.597
I was just miserable.

02:55.597 --> 02:57.847
Making money for what?

02:57.847 --> 02:59.889
It was all
just meaningless.

02:59.889 --> 03:02.556
I want you to know
I'm really sorry.

03:04.556 --> 03:06.931
Dude!

03:06.931 --> 03:10.348
Ah, Robert.

03:10.348 --> 03:12.348
Ah, Nick,
not so tight.

03:14.556 --> 03:16.681
A little tweak
down there.

03:16.681 --> 03:18.764
This is ridiculous.
Let me help you.

03:25.473 --> 03:27.722
Thanks, Nick.

03:33.931 --> 03:35.431
- Hi.
- Hi, hi.

03:35.431 --> 03:36.889
- Nice to see you.
- You, too.

03:36.889 --> 03:38.556
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

03:38.556 --> 03:40.722
- Here, let me take your coat.
- Oh, thank you.

03:40.722 --> 03:42.681
- Throw it on the couch.
- Okay.

03:42.681 --> 03:43.931
Thanks for coming.

03:43.931 --> 03:45.473
I didn't know
who else to ask.

03:45.473 --> 03:46.764
Oh, it's
my pleasure.

03:46.764 --> 03:48.931
My aunt, she--
she died two months ago,

03:48.931 --> 03:51.014
so I'm left just dealing
with all of her stuff.

03:51.014 --> 03:52.431
Oh, I'm sorry
about that.

03:52.431 --> 03:54.098
No, it's okay.
She was a monster.

03:54.098 --> 03:57.431
- She hit people.
- Well, then good riddance.

03:57.431 --> 04:00.597
So, what do you think?
Is it worth anything?

04:00.597 --> 04:03.515
Uh, I don't know.

04:03.515 --> 04:05.931
Or wait,
do I sound like a jerk
because you love art

04:05.931 --> 04:07.764
and I'm just trying
to make a buck here?

04:07.764 --> 04:10.847
Well, I love art

04:10.847 --> 04:13.390
and I'm trying
to make a buck,

04:13.390 --> 04:16.556
so I'm as awful
as you are.

04:18.056 --> 04:20.098
Yeah.

04:20.098 --> 04:23.473
No, I don't recognize
any of these artists.

04:24.764 --> 04:27.265
But wow, this is...

04:29.265 --> 04:30.722
this is beautiful.

04:30.722 --> 04:32.681
You love
your work, huh?

04:32.681 --> 04:34.556
Finally, yeah.

04:34.556 --> 04:38.265
So do you wanna
get dinner with me
sometime?

04:41.806 --> 04:43.889
Do you--
do you mean
like a date?

04:43.889 --> 04:47.014
Like-- like the thing
you said I shouldn't
be doing?

04:47.014 --> 04:48.806
- Mm-hmm.

04:48.806 --> 04:51.806
- Oh, no, that must've
been before.

04:51.806 --> 04:55.390
Before you were rattling
around in my brain.

05:00.639 --> 05:02.639
No, I don't--
I don't think so.

05:02.639 --> 05:05.515
- Oh, okay.
- No, it's not--

05:05.515 --> 05:08.764
I think I should just

05:08.764 --> 05:11.390
- be on my own for a bit.
- No, I get it.

05:11.390 --> 05:13.348
It takes a while
to learn how to be alone.

05:13.348 --> 05:17.515
But don't take too long,
because this whole situation...

05:17.515 --> 05:20.597
- ...will not sit
on the shelf forever.

05:20.597 --> 05:22.181
- Noted.
- Also, here.

05:22.181 --> 05:24.014
This is for you;
my thanks.

05:24.014 --> 05:25.556
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no way.

05:25.556 --> 05:27.764
- I can't take that, no.
- Please, it's yours.

05:27.764 --> 05:30.223
Unless it turns out
to have any value;
then I'd like it back.

05:30.223 --> 05:33.764
- Fair enough, fair enough.

05:33.764 --> 05:36.056
Wow, I love it.

05:39.681 --> 05:41.973
( man on TV
speaking Japanese )

05:47.181 --> 05:48.181
Nick.

05:54.597 --> 05:55.931
Nick!

05:55.931 --> 06:00.556
I'm being fun
and flirty!

06:00.556 --> 06:04.056
I'm sorry, dear,
I'm trying to cut
the saku just right.

06:04.056 --> 06:06.098
My corset boobs
used to drive you crazy.

06:06.098 --> 06:09.681
And they will again,
but right now, it's all
about my knife skills.

06:09.681 --> 06:13.473
- But I'm a red devil.
- Honey, you should be happy

06:13.473 --> 06:16.473
I've found something
that gives me so much
pleasure.

06:16.473 --> 06:19.265
I just wish you had
something comparable.

06:19.265 --> 06:21.098
What do you mean?
I have something comparable.

06:21.098 --> 06:24.639
- Well, yes, of course.
The art gallery.

06:24.639 --> 06:26.847
I'm very
passionate about it.

06:26.847 --> 06:27.889
As a matter of fact,

06:27.889 --> 06:29.056
tomorrow night,
I'm taking Frances

06:29.056 --> 06:30.390
to Gurbaksh Lee's
birthday party...

06:30.390 --> 06:31.515
in Harlem.

06:31.515 --> 06:33.390
And I plan
on introducing her

06:33.390 --> 06:34.764
to all very
important collectors.

06:34.764 --> 06:35.931
So I have a lot of
very important stuff

06:35.931 --> 06:37.306
going on, too, Nick.

06:37.306 --> 06:41.473
Perfect, because that is
one party I'm happy to miss.

06:41.473 --> 06:43.306
Finance people,

06:43.306 --> 06:45.597
what a pretentious
bunch of dullards.

06:48.265 --> 06:49.973
Goddamn perfection.

06:51.139 --> 06:53.223
Okay, Sylvia Mac--

06:53.223 --> 06:55.931
Sylvia
MacDonald-Feinstein.

06:55.931 --> 06:59.223
Yes, yes. And once again,
I'm so sorry to have
bothered you.

06:59.223 --> 07:02.431
And I'm
so, so, so sorry

07:02.431 --> 07:03.847
to hear that your--

07:03.847 --> 07:06.556
that your dog
was murdered.

07:06.556 --> 07:09.597
Okay, my sincere
condolences.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.973
Yes, bye-bye.

07:14.056 --> 07:16.431
- Diane:
Good morning, Frances.

07:16.431 --> 07:18.556
Frances:
Morning.

07:18.556 --> 07:19.973
Uh, we have a red dot.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.889
Yay, a red dot!
I love a red dot.

07:22.889 --> 07:24.847
- I got you an iced coffee.
- Thank you.

07:24.847 --> 07:28.722
Got one for myself.
Ready to do some business.

07:28.722 --> 07:31.181
But one sale?

07:31.181 --> 07:33.181
That's why we need
to talk this place up
tomorrow night.

07:33.181 --> 07:35.639
We need to make it
like a destination,
you know?

07:35.639 --> 07:38.098
Like Cuba.
What's this?

07:38.098 --> 07:41.639
Oh, uh, it's--
Andrew gave it to me.

07:41.639 --> 07:44.348
- Well, not like that, no.

07:44.348 --> 07:46.764
He asked me to--
to appraise some art.

07:46.764 --> 07:50.139
- I knew you guys
were a good match.
- Oh, no, I told him no.

07:50.139 --> 07:52.139
- Sylvia MacDonald.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.014
- Never heard of her.
- Yeah, me neither.

07:54.014 --> 07:56.806
I'm trying to find her.
You know, maybe she has
some other work.

07:56.806 --> 07:58.847
Wow, good
for you, Frances.

07:58.847 --> 08:00.847
Out there,
discovering an artist.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.556
Well, so far,
we only have locals,

08:02.556 --> 08:04.014
and I don't know
how deep that bench is.

08:04.014 --> 08:06.014
I'm worried we're,
like, six months away

08:06.014 --> 08:08.181
- from bird houses
and painted rocks.
- Yeah, I get it.

08:08.181 --> 08:10.847
And as your
business partner,

08:10.847 --> 08:13.515
I completely support you
on whatever you wanna do.

08:13.515 --> 08:15.223
Thank you.

08:15.223 --> 08:17.265
Hey, can I ask you
a question?

08:17.265 --> 08:19.390
- Sure.
- I have
good tits, right?

08:19.390 --> 08:22.348
- You have great tits.
- Why, thank you.

08:27.722 --> 08:30.139
- Hi.
- Oh, God! Hi, hey.

08:30.139 --> 08:32.265
Yeah, sorry.
I'm just here to get
a little sneak peek

08:32.265 --> 08:35.139
before the open house,
ahead of the competition.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.889
- I'm Jackie.
- Oh, hey, Jackie.

08:36.889 --> 08:39.139
That's a classic
realtor move.

08:39.139 --> 08:41.306
Well, I am a realtor,
but this one's for me.

08:41.306 --> 08:43.223
My daughter and I are
moving into the neighborhood.

08:45.098 --> 08:47.597
Ugh, never mind.

08:47.597 --> 08:49.390
Really?
That

08:49.390 --> 08:51.181
This kitchen doesn't
have double sinks,

08:51.181 --> 08:55.056
and I need to be able to
pile my dishes up for
at least five days.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.556
No judgment.

08:56.556 --> 08:58.390
But you know what?

09:00.139 --> 09:01.722
You know what,
I happen to know

09:01.722 --> 09:03.889
a house in the vicinity
that's for sale

09:03.889 --> 09:06.556
that has two sinks
and a pasta faucet.

09:06.556 --> 09:08.223
Why are we
whispering?

09:08.223 --> 09:10.390
Because
the house is mine.

09:10.390 --> 09:12.722
I don't wanna get
labeled as a poacher.

09:12.722 --> 09:15.306
It's a bad thing.
But you know what,
to heck with it.

09:15.306 --> 09:16.847
I can show you
the house tomorrow.

09:16.847 --> 09:19.597
Really?
How's 5:00?

09:19.597 --> 09:21.139
That's great!
That's great.

09:21.139 --> 09:25.098
Let me, uh--
Robert DuFresne,
general contractor.

09:27.431 --> 09:30.681
Listen, uh,
no free looks
before the open house.

09:30.681 --> 09:33.223
So I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

09:33.223 --> 09:36.014
Oh!

09:36.014 --> 09:38.639
Thanks for
cooperating.

09:52.139 --> 09:53.431
- Hello.
- Hi!

09:53.431 --> 09:55.431
This might seem
a little bit strange,

09:55.431 --> 09:58.931
but are you
Sylvia MacDonald,
the painter,

09:58.931 --> 10:01.973
who at one point painted
an exquisite portrait

10:01.973 --> 10:07.098
of, um-- of a man's face
in front of a moody,
grayish background?

10:07.098 --> 10:09.931
I know this is odd,
but I came across
the painting,

10:09.931 --> 10:11.597
and I was
so taken with it.

10:11.597 --> 10:14.306
I have a gallery,
it's in Hastings.

10:14.306 --> 10:18.639
But anyway,
are you by any chance

10:18.639 --> 10:20.681
that Sylvia MacDonald?

10:20.681 --> 10:22.098
No.

10:22.098 --> 10:25.431
Um, you know what,
can I get, um...

10:26.556 --> 10:28.556
could-- can I get--

10:28.556 --> 10:30.306
could I get two rolls
of quarters, please?

10:30.306 --> 10:32.681
I found
a YouTube video

10:32.681 --> 10:35.390
of who I think is you
from 2008,

10:35.390 --> 10:38.889
and it was an art opening
where you talked about
your paintings.

10:38.889 --> 10:41.014
Here you go, ma'am.
Thank you. Next!

10:41.014 --> 10:44.139
- No, um, can you just
wait one second?
- Next!

10:44.139 --> 10:45.681
- One second, one second.
- Woman: There's a line.

10:45.681 --> 10:49.556
Um, can I get just change
for this 20, please?

10:49.556 --> 10:51.431
- Woman: Come on!

10:51.431 --> 10:54.722
How about you take
your coffee break now?

11:00.597 --> 11:02.473
So, you saw
one painting of mine

11:02.473 --> 11:03.889
and tracked me down
to my job?

11:03.889 --> 11:06.847
Yes, and I understand
that this is intrusive,

11:06.847 --> 11:08.764
but I loved it.

11:08.764 --> 11:11.515
I just wanted
to see your other work.

11:11.515 --> 11:13.973
- For my gallery.
- Yes, in Hastings.

11:13.973 --> 11:16.181
Listen, Frances,
I don't know you.

11:16.181 --> 11:19.681
Do you know what I'm saying?
I don't know anything
about you.

11:19.681 --> 11:22.556
And you come here
to my place of business,

11:22.556 --> 11:25.556
talking about
a painting you saw
and wanting to work with me?

11:25.556 --> 11:29.806
I know it sounds crazy,
but I can still like
your painting.

11:29.806 --> 11:31.556
What did you like
about it?

11:33.056 --> 11:34.764
Uh, okay.

11:36.722 --> 11:39.473
I-- I liked
your marks.

11:39.473 --> 11:41.597
You know,
I like what you did
in the, um--

11:41.597 --> 11:45.889
in the upper
right-hand corner
with the gray.

11:45.889 --> 11:47.556
You know,
then there's the--

11:47.556 --> 11:50.639
the part that--
that you just can't explain.

11:50.639 --> 11:52.889
You just have
a reaction, you know?

11:52.889 --> 11:58.390
I-- I'm just asking
to see more, that's all.

11:58.390 --> 12:00.056
It's not
"that's all."

12:00.056 --> 12:03.056
It's what I do.
It's my most private thing.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.139
How would you like it
if I walked into your
place of business and said,

12:06.139 --> 12:09.056
"Excuse me,
but could you
show me your labia?

12:09.056 --> 12:11.139
I've been waiting
a whole 10 minutes,

12:11.139 --> 12:13.098
so I really deserve
to see your labia."

12:13.098 --> 12:18.390
- Well, I wouldn't
like that one bit.
- It's the same thing.

12:18.390 --> 12:22.223
Well, except...

12:22.223 --> 12:27.348
my labia,
you know, wasn't meant,
by it's very medium,

12:27.348 --> 12:30.098
to be hung on a wall
and enjoyed by others.

12:31.847 --> 12:34.515
I think your painting
is great.

12:34.515 --> 12:36.556
I gotta go
back to work.

12:43.348 --> 12:45.431
( car alarm blaring
in distance )

12:51.473 --> 12:55.764
So the slate
ceramic flooring,
powder room,

12:55.764 --> 12:58.223
breathtaking view
of the Hudson River Valley.

12:58.223 --> 13:01.556
I'm doing some inlay
on the glass doors.

13:01.556 --> 13:04.473
Calligraphy,
if you will.

13:04.473 --> 13:07.473
Here it is
just as promoted.

13:07.473 --> 13:10.847
Two sinks,
pasta faucet,

13:10.847 --> 13:12.764
and it's not
totally finished

13:12.764 --> 13:14.847
so you can
tinker around,

13:14.847 --> 13:17.515
- get it to be like
you want it to be.
- Mm-hmm.

13:19.681 --> 13:23.306
I'm only gonna
sell it to somebody that's
absolutely crazy about it.

13:23.306 --> 13:27.515
Like, "Jesus,
I have got to have sex
with this house."

13:27.515 --> 13:29.681
Not sex in the house,

13:29.681 --> 13:32.515
sex with the house.

13:32.515 --> 13:33.722
Yeah.

13:35.473 --> 13:37.556
I don't wanna
have sex with
your house.

13:37.556 --> 13:39.014
Well, I was being
figurative.

13:39.014 --> 13:41.556
Oh, no, no, I like it.
I like it well enough.

13:41.556 --> 13:43.889
And if I was gonna
take it off your hands,

13:43.889 --> 13:46.889
I'd just have to knock, like,
$100k off the asking price.

13:46.889 --> 13:49.390
What
That's crazy!

13:49.390 --> 13:51.681
I just would have to
rip everything out

13:51.681 --> 13:53.014
and start
from scratch.

13:53.014 --> 13:54.639
These design choices
are just way off.

13:54.639 --> 13:56.681
- Yeah, like this island,

13:56.681 --> 13:58.390
I would definitely--
I would cut it in half.

13:58.390 --> 14:01.223
I would add
a little cabinetry,
maybe a wine cooler.

14:01.223 --> 14:03.515
And these
floors, ugh!

14:03.515 --> 14:05.515
Where did you get them,
Home Depot?

14:05.515 --> 14:07.181
That is
Siberian larch wood!

14:07.181 --> 14:09.098
They look
really generic.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.056
This house
means a lot to me.

14:11.056 --> 14:14.223
It sheltered me through
some pretty difficult times.

14:14.223 --> 14:16.973
There's no way
I'm gonna sell
this house to you

14:16.973 --> 14:18.556
for your
crappy offer.

14:18.556 --> 14:21.931
And, you know,
you've got a little bit
of an attitude.

14:21.931 --> 14:24.556
Well, I opened up an office
about 10 minutes away.

14:24.556 --> 14:27.265
Why don't you take my card
in case you change your mind.

14:28.515 --> 14:31.722
You can imagine
that this card

14:31.722 --> 14:33.889
is gonna be
ripped in half.

14:33.889 --> 14:36.597
I'm not gonna
do it in front of you
because that would be rude.

14:36.597 --> 14:40.597
But in here and in here,
ripped in half.

14:40.597 --> 14:42.556
Okay. Thank you
for your time.

14:42.556 --> 14:43.515
Bye.

14:43.515 --> 14:46.515
Thanks for yours.

14:52.348 --> 14:54.764
Oh, fuck.
Holy fuck.

15:04.722 --> 15:07.473
- Yes.
- He's adorable.

15:07.473 --> 15:10.847
- Hi, Simone! So pretty.
- Hi! She's dressed like my mom.

15:10.847 --> 15:12.597
- D.J.!
- Diane.

15:12.597 --> 15:15.223
Oh, nice to
see you.

15:15.223 --> 15:17.014
This is
D.J. Crawford.

15:17.014 --> 15:18.931
- Hi.
- Young, beautiful,
worth about 20 million.

15:18.931 --> 15:20.764
Don't you just wanna
strangle her in her sleep?

15:20.764 --> 15:22.597
Diane,
you are hysterical.

15:22.597 --> 15:24.556
- I am, I am.
- Oh, my gosh, so funny.

15:24.556 --> 15:27.139
- She's very funny.
- This is Frances Everdell,

15:27.139 --> 15:28.931
my partner
in our new gallery.

15:28.931 --> 15:30.931
A gallery?
That's exciting!

15:30.931 --> 15:33.473
- Hastings, New York.

15:33.473 --> 15:35.431
Hastings?
Like upstate?

15:35.431 --> 15:36.847
No, it's not
upstate.

15:38.681 --> 15:40.056
That's so great.

15:40.056 --> 15:41.973
Is it like folk art
kind of stuff?

15:41.973 --> 15:47.348
Um, no, it's just
regular contemporary art.

15:47.348 --> 15:50.181
Yeah, and it's--
it's not upstate.

15:50.181 --> 15:52.473
We like to think of it
as a "safe space"

15:52.473 --> 15:55.473
kind of away from
all the New York judgment,
if you will.

15:55.473 --> 15:57.473
- That's so great.
- Gurbaksh!

15:57.473 --> 15:59.515
Happy birthday!

15:59.515 --> 16:01.390
Aw, how old
are you today?

16:01.390 --> 16:04.098
- 32.
- The big 3-2!

16:04.098 --> 16:05.556
Very big milestone.

16:05.556 --> 16:06.681
Excuse me, please.

16:06.681 --> 16:07.806
- Oh, sure.
- Nice to see you.

16:07.806 --> 16:08.973
Happy birthday.

16:12.515 --> 16:15.597
Okay, folks.
Thanks for coming
to my birthday party.

16:15.597 --> 16:17.722
As you know,
I forbade presents
this year,

16:17.722 --> 16:20.973
but thanks to all of you
who donated to my
charter school.

16:20.973 --> 16:23.348
However, I did
get myself a present.

16:23.348 --> 16:26.639
One that's been
five years in the making.

16:26.639 --> 16:30.681
- Wow.
- So, the moment
I have been waiting for.

16:36.390 --> 16:40.014
- Um, sorry, I...
- Of course, of course.

16:40.014 --> 16:43.722
- Frances, he bought a Pelts!

16:43.722 --> 16:45.515
Yes, I can see that.

16:45.515 --> 16:47.515
Wow! What,
you don't like it?

16:47.515 --> 16:49.764
- No, I do not.

16:49.764 --> 16:53.722
It's big
and... nothing.

16:53.722 --> 16:57.056
- Hmm.
- Just feels
"following the herd."

16:58.431 --> 17:00.181
Well, the herd
is the one buying the art,

17:00.181 --> 17:01.556
and they seem
to love it.

17:01.556 --> 17:04.390
I don't,
but it's okay.

17:04.390 --> 17:07.139
- I'm gonna look around.
- Okay.

17:07.139 --> 17:08.722
Excuse me.
Sorry, D.J.

17:08.722 --> 17:11.390
Edibles?
We have mellow-high,

17:11.390 --> 17:14.764
giggly-high, horny-high,
and completely fucked-up.

17:14.764 --> 17:16.098
Oh.

17:16.098 --> 17:19.889
I will take
the completely fucked-up.

17:19.889 --> 17:21.889
All right.

17:21.889 --> 17:24.806
- All right, enjoy.
- Mmm.

17:24.806 --> 17:27.098
- Mmm.

17:29.223 --> 17:31.014
Was it St. Bart's?

17:31.014 --> 17:34.348
I will never
fly commercial
ever again.

17:34.348 --> 17:36.056
- So gross!

17:36.056 --> 17:40.265
Like, the smell.
I will never forget
the smell.

17:40.265 --> 17:41.722
It was so bad!

17:41.722 --> 17:44.431
- It's like a bus with mules.

17:44.431 --> 17:45.722
I know!

17:56.931 --> 17:59.597
( all laughing,
shouting )

18:03.973 --> 18:06.639
- Come on.

18:10.348 --> 18:12.390
- Come on, bitch.

18:12.390 --> 18:13.973
Yeah.

18:16.473 --> 18:18.681
Excuse me.
Have a good night.

18:30.139 --> 18:31.889
This is amazing.

18:31.889 --> 18:33.681
Mmm, the crunch!

18:33.681 --> 18:35.597
It's a crunch explosion
in my mouth.

18:35.597 --> 18:37.764
Won't you accept
this rose, please?

18:38.973 --> 18:41.847
- Diane.
Frances!

18:41.847 --> 18:43.515
You are not gonna believe
what just happened.

18:43.515 --> 18:44.847
I just got
my friend Brett here

18:44.847 --> 18:46.597
to loan us
a Pelts.

18:46.597 --> 18:48.806
- From his collection,
for the gallery,

18:48.806 --> 18:52.139
- to help put us on the map!
- That's so generous.

18:52.139 --> 18:54.139
My pleasure.

18:54.139 --> 18:56.390
Can I talk to you
for a second?

18:56.390 --> 18:58.681
- Sure.
- She will be
right back.

18:58.681 --> 18:59.973
What?

18:59.973 --> 19:02.889
I'm sorry, but we--
we can't take that.

19:02.889 --> 19:04.181
!
- No.

19:04.181 --> 19:06.556
Frances, this is
exactly what we wanted!

19:06.556 --> 19:08.764
To take the gallery
to the next level.

19:08.764 --> 19:11.556
Yes, but I was hoping
that would happen

19:11.556 --> 19:14.515
by showing
what I like,

19:14.515 --> 19:16.889
not what
other people like.

19:16.889 --> 19:20.515
But, Frances,
no one is gonna come
if they don't know we exist!

19:20.515 --> 19:23.889
- I know you mean well,
I really do.

19:23.889 --> 19:28.014
But-- but we're not
actually partners.

19:28.014 --> 19:31.515
You loaned me money,
which I appreciate so much.

19:31.515 --> 19:35.556
But I'm-- I'm not looking
for a partnership right now.

19:35.556 --> 19:39.473
- Mm-hmm.
- You know,
I always imagined...

19:40.681 --> 19:43.390
the gallery
was just mine.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.306
This really hurts
my feelings.

19:45.306 --> 19:48.223
I just got
someone to loan us
a $2 million sculpture.

19:48.223 --> 19:49.931
- No, I know.
- I'm good at things,

19:49.931 --> 19:52.014
and I'm tired of people
not seeing that.

19:52.014 --> 19:54.223
Diane, you are
good at things.

19:54.223 --> 19:56.265
And so am I.

20:00.681 --> 20:02.764
Okay, I gotta go.

20:29.265 --> 20:32.098
Oh! Hi!

20:32.098 --> 20:33.847
Hi!

20:39.764 --> 20:42.306
It's 1:00
in the morning.

20:42.306 --> 20:45.764
Yeah, yeah, no,
I know that.

20:45.764 --> 20:47.098
I know that.

20:48.764 --> 20:51.431
I am going to
have to insist
that you let me in

20:51.431 --> 20:53.764
and show me
your work.

20:53.764 --> 20:56.722
I have a feeling
about you, Sylvia.

20:56.722 --> 20:59.139
That's just
the way it is.

20:59.139 --> 21:00.265
Okay?

21:00.265 --> 21:02.473
I don't want
to scare you,

21:02.473 --> 21:07.847
but I might just
have to stay here
till you let me in.

21:13.597 --> 21:14.931
They're gorgeous.

21:17.265 --> 21:18.806
And unfinished?

21:18.806 --> 21:20.181
I keep painting them,

21:20.181 --> 21:22.639
and then every day,
I keep realizing
they're shit.

21:24.515 --> 21:26.390
Okay,
you should go now.

21:26.390 --> 21:28.265
No, wait, wait, wait,
I just wanna understand.

21:28.265 --> 21:32.181
So at some point,
you finished your paintings.

21:32.181 --> 21:34.056
I was represented
by a gallery,

21:34.056 --> 21:35.306
then I stopped
selling,

21:35.306 --> 21:37.014
then the bougie-ass
gallery dropped me.

21:37.014 --> 21:39.473
And so you don't
finish anything anymore?

21:40.597 --> 21:42.306
Fuck the galleries!

21:42.306 --> 21:44.098
Fuck the art world!

21:44.098 --> 21:48.014
What, you think
that those people know
something that you don't?

21:48.014 --> 21:50.722
I am here to tell you,
unequivocally,

21:50.722 --> 21:52.139
that they do not.

21:52.139 --> 21:54.014
They just
fake it better.

21:54.014 --> 21:56.139
They're just--
they just fake it.

21:56.139 --> 22:02.014
- You really should go now.
- Finish a painting
for both of us.

22:05.348 --> 22:07.889
- Well, good morning!
- Good morning.

22:09.014 --> 22:11.556
Ugh, good morning.

22:11.556 --> 22:14.515
I'm so sorry
I didn't make it
into bed last night.

22:14.515 --> 22:16.889
We had
such a crazy night.

22:16.889 --> 22:18.515
Did you miss me
terribly?

22:18.515 --> 22:19.806
I hadn't even
noticed.

22:26.223 --> 22:27.639
She's a real
ballbuster, this one,

22:27.639 --> 22:28.764
let me
tell you, Nick.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.764
Walking around
my house,

22:30.764 --> 22:34.889
with her condescending nose
sticking up in the air.

22:34.889 --> 22:37.056
It's really annoying.

22:37.056 --> 22:41.098
Granted, she did seem
to know her way around
home renovation,

22:41.098 --> 22:44.390
which is not
not hot.

22:44.390 --> 22:47.556
Realtors in general,
very attractive industry.

22:47.556 --> 22:50.223
There's no way
I'm gonna sell my house
for that price.

22:52.265 --> 22:54.390
Even though
the chiropractors
pretty much told me

22:54.390 --> 22:58.014
I'm done in
the physical labor arena.

22:58.014 --> 23:00.722
But, still,
at that price,
no way, Nick!

23:00.722 --> 23:03.056
Good for you,
Robert.

23:04.931 --> 23:06.223
Listen,

23:06.223 --> 23:08.098
if you need money--

23:08.098 --> 23:10.181
No! Absolutely not!

23:10.181 --> 23:11.473
Thank you, but no.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.306
That's not what
this is about.

23:13.306 --> 23:16.056
It's about two guys
sitting around complaining,

23:16.056 --> 23:18.265
one of them bitching
about his bad back

23:18.265 --> 23:20.265
while watching
another guy

23:20.265 --> 23:23.806
build the professional-grade
pizza oven.

23:23.806 --> 23:25.806
- Hector!

23:25.806 --> 23:28.931
- Muchas gracias.
- Mm-hmm.

23:28.931 --> 23:30.639
Muy bien.

23:39.889 --> 23:41.265
Uh, excuse me?

23:41.265 --> 23:43.931
Hi. What--
what is that?

23:43.931 --> 23:45.764
Oh, it's a delivery
from Brett Morris.

23:45.764 --> 23:49.223
Diane Clavowen
gave us the alarm code.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.515
It looks like shit.

24:01.515 --> 24:03.139
Yeah.

24:03.139 --> 24:04.515
Literally.

24:04.515 --> 24:06.764
But it's a Pelts.

24:12.139 --> 24:15.597
- So take a look around
and see what you think.

24:15.597 --> 24:17.014
And just so you know,
I'm not gonna

24:17.014 --> 24:18.681
follow you around the house
like some serial killer.

24:18.681 --> 24:20.806
I believe a good home
sells itself.

24:20.806 --> 24:22.348
Have a lobster roll.

24:22.348 --> 24:24.806
- Hi! Lobster rolls in there.
- Man: Thanks.

24:24.806 --> 24:26.473
- Woman: Hi.
- Hey. Thank you.

24:33.056 --> 24:38.181
So, I guess
you're surprised
to see me here.

24:38.181 --> 24:40.473
- Not really.
Okay.

24:40.473 --> 24:43.847
Um, well, look,

24:43.847 --> 24:47.056
my circumstances
have changed a little bit.

24:47.056 --> 24:49.931
- So I--
- Hi! Welcome.

24:49.931 --> 24:51.681
- Woman: Hi.
- This is a very

24:51.681 --> 24:53.181
lesbian-friendly
neighborhood.

24:53.181 --> 24:55.139
Go right in there,
check out the rest
of the house.

24:55.139 --> 24:57.014
Thank you.
I'm sorry, what?

24:57.014 --> 25:00.431
I have decided to accept
your crappy offer.

25:00.431 --> 25:01.889
- Mm-hmm.

25:01.889 --> 25:03.431
Even though
that is in no way

25:03.431 --> 25:06.473
an indication that I don't
stand by my quality work,

25:06.473 --> 25:10.181
which is 10 times better
than this Ikea shitbox

25:10.181 --> 25:11.973
you're selling
here today.

25:11.973 --> 25:16.014
All the cabinetry
is from a tiny mill
in North Carolina.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.889
I have the paperwork
if you'd like to see it.

25:17.889 --> 25:19.223
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

25:19.223 --> 25:21.556
I poured my heart and soul
into that house.

25:21.556 --> 25:23.889
- And I wish
I could tell you

25:23.889 --> 25:25.722
to shove
your crappy offer.

25:25.722 --> 25:28.431
But I can't do that
because I'm having

25:28.431 --> 25:31.597
a situation in
my lower lumbar region

25:31.597 --> 25:34.681
that requires an influx
of fresh capital.

25:34.681 --> 25:35.764
Would you calm down?

25:35.764 --> 25:37.556
I'm trying
to do business here!

25:37.556 --> 25:39.223
Is it the business
of crapping

25:39.223 --> 25:40.931
all over a man's
hard work?

25:40.931 --> 25:42.764
Shh! I was
lowballing you!

25:44.764 --> 25:45.931
Oh.

25:47.515 --> 25:49.181
What about my island?

25:49.181 --> 25:50.722
Oh, it's perfect.

25:50.722 --> 25:52.597
Well, fucking A
it is.

25:52.597 --> 25:54.847
I loved your house
the minute I walked in.

25:54.847 --> 25:57.056
I know right away
when I like something.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.931
It has never
failed me.

25:58.931 --> 26:02.265
So what
you're saying

26:02.265 --> 26:05.431
is that you wanna
have sex with my house?

26:05.431 --> 26:06.889
I'd blow it
and see where that goes.

26:06.889 --> 26:09.973
25K off the asking;
that's it.

26:09.973 --> 26:12.973
- 75 and we close.
- 50K and the house is yours.

26:12.973 --> 26:14.597
Deal.

26:14.597 --> 26:16.223
Deal.

27:07.764 --> 27:10.473
This is
so exciting.

27:10.473 --> 27:12.931
To have
an Eliot Pelts
in Hastings.

27:12.931 --> 27:15.431
- Yes, shocking,
isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

27:25.223 --> 27:26.390
Oh.

27:30.639 --> 27:31.515
Oh.

27:33.681 --> 27:36.014
I haven't decided
if I'm selling that yet.

27:39.431 --> 27:41.515
It's beautiful.

27:41.515 --> 27:43.806
- I just love it.
- Me, too.

27:45.556 --> 27:47.764
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

27:47.764 --> 27:50.306
And, um, thanks
for your interest.

28:00.056 --> 28:03.348
I think I met someone.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.806

29:38.556 --> 29:39.764
Doctors have recommended

29:39.764 --> 29:41.556
that I get there as quickly
as possible.

29:41.556 --> 29:43.014
Just dealing
with my sister alone

29:43.014 --> 29:44.265
is gonna be a ground war.

29:44.265 --> 29:47.473
It's okay to let go!
Go play fetch with Chester!

29:47.473 --> 29:50.139
Don't tell him to go
play fetch with Chester!

29:50.973 --> 29:53.973
I just don't feel good
about not being with him.

29:53.973 --> 29:55.098
You're divorced now.
You're free.

29:55.306 --> 29:58.306
I was married forever.
These feelings are involuntary.

29:58.306 --> 30:00.639
Well, tick-tock.
Time to make new feelings.
