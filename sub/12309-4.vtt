00:02.719 --> 00:03.994
What are you talking about?

00:04.080 --> 00:06.469
I'm telling you, she's
hiding him from me.

00:06.560 --> 00:07.879
- She's not hiding him.
- Oh, yeah?

00:07.960 --> 00:11.077
Every time I go to see him, she
tells me that he's just settled down.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.754
- Can you blame her? You dropped him.
- I did not drop him, he jumped.

00:13.840 --> 00:15.717
- Jumped?
- Well, he wiggled out of my arms.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.678
I said I was sorry. Besides, how much
damage could I possibly have done?

00:18.760 --> 00:22.275
He fell, like, maybe two feet.
Stuff like that happens all the time.

00:22.360 --> 00:24.316
I mean, I was dropped, like,
a dozen times when I was a kid.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.469
Well, that explains a lot.

00:25.560 --> 00:26.754
Why do you even care?
You don't even like kids.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.034
It's the principle of the thing.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.792
Everyone else gets to
hold him, why shouldn't I?

00:29.880 --> 00:33.475
Colonel, we've got a new
contact. Looks like a ship.

00:34.080 --> 00:36.150
- How far out?
- It's in orbit.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.636
- Well, how come we didn't detect it?
- I don't know.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.039
We didn't even detect
a hyperspace window.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.155
It just appeared out of nowhere.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.629
Hang on a second, we're getting IFF.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.119
It's the Daedalus.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.509
The Daedalus? How can that be?
They're on their way back to Earth.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.068
Well, they were. Or
they were supposed to be.

00:52.040 --> 00:53.632
Open up a channel.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.719
Daedalus, this is
Atlantis, please come in.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.477
Daedalus, please respond.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.800
- They're not going to answer.
- Why not?

01:06.280 --> 01:08.669
Because I'm not reading any lifesigns.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.433
What are you telling me, Rodney?
This thing flew here by itself?

01:11.520 --> 01:14.592
I don't know how they got here,
but there's no one on board.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.511
At least, no one alive.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:26.600 --> 02:29.160
Colonel, we just got confirmation
from Stargate Command.

02:29.600 --> 02:32.797
The Daedalus is in the Milky
Way, on course and on schedule.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.836
They expect to reach
Earth within two days.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.194
Understood.

02:36.680 --> 02:39.194
So that's not the Daedalus, then?

02:39.280 --> 02:43.273
Well, not unless it can
be in two places at once.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.632
Perhaps the Apollo or
one of your other ships...

02:45.720 --> 02:47.472
They wouldn't be sending Daedalus IFF.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.834
Plus, it doesn't explain
how they got here,

02:48.920 --> 02:51.798
or why we're not picking
up lifesign readings.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.951
All right, I'm taking
us in for a closer look.

03:13.720 --> 03:15.358
Wow, you see that?

03:16.120 --> 03:17.917
Yeah, some scorch marks.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.433
You think weaponsfire?

03:19.520 --> 03:23.229
Wherever she's been, she's been
through some pretty hard times.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.436
- What's that?
- I'm picking up an energy reading.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.949
- It's coming from the ship.
- Is it dangerous?

03:30.040 --> 03:32.349
I don't think so, but I have
no idea what's causing it.

03:32.440 --> 03:33.634
Can you get the bay doors open?

03:33.720 --> 03:35.631
If the ship's command systems
are as familiar as the rest of it,

03:35.720 --> 03:37.676
it shouldn't be a problem.

03:52.480 --> 03:56.473
No F-302s, but there's a Jumper.

03:56.680 --> 03:59.274
You sure there's no one else inside?

03:59.360 --> 04:01.191
As far as I can tell.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.236
All right, we're going in.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.312
Why is it so cold in here?

04:21.399 --> 04:23.789
The ship's operating on emergency power.

04:23.880 --> 04:26.155
Look, some of the systems
were barely registering.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.595
- Except for the whole weird energy thing.
- That's right.

04:28.680 --> 04:30.875
Can you do something about
it? It's freezing in here.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.793
Oh, sure, I just have
to get to engineering.

04:33.880 --> 04:34.869
You and Ronon are together.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.791
Teyla, you and I are going
to check out the bridge.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.996
Radio me if you find anything.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.752
No bodies in here.

04:59.480 --> 05:00.754
Colonel...

05:05.920 --> 05:08.036
It's the Daedalus, all right.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.598
McKay, is that you?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.477
Of course it was me.
Who else would it be?

05:14.560 --> 05:16.437
You think we've got a
ghost on board or something?

05:18.600 --> 05:20.989
Will you please not touch anything?

05:21.840 --> 05:22.989
What's our status?

05:23.080 --> 05:25.150
I've restored basic
power to most of the ship.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.037
It should be warming up any second now.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.314
Good.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.594
Check on that energy reading.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.319
Try to figure out what it is, all right?

05:32.560 --> 05:33.879
I'm on it.

05:35.400 --> 05:39.029
Colonel, ship's log, last entry.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.431
Preparations are almost complete.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.112
We've beamed down the
last of our supplies

05:48.200 --> 05:50.270
and any equipment we
think might be useful.

05:50.360 --> 05:53.432
I'll be taking the last
of the F-302s down myself.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.472
Of course, we haven't had
time to do a proper survey

05:55.560 --> 05:58.393
of the planet's surface, but
it seems habitable enough.

05:58.480 --> 06:02.678
Plenty of fresh water, arable soil
not that different from our own...

06:02.760 --> 06:05.274
I realize our chance of rescue is slim,

06:05.360 --> 06:08.796
but it's become obvious that
we no longer have a choice.

06:09.360 --> 06:13.069
This is Colonel Sobel, commander
of the Da edalus, signing off.

06:14.120 --> 06:18.318
- Do you recognize her?
- I've never seen her before in my life.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.789
Well, it appears as
if they abandoned ship.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.871
Yeah. The question is, why?

06:24.120 --> 06:26.190
I'll check previous entries.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.395
Man, this ship has been
through the wringer.

06:31.480 --> 06:34.392
No hyperdrive, subspace communications
are all damaged beyond repair,

06:34.480 --> 06:36.948
the shields are virtually depleted...

06:39.440 --> 06:40.589
What is it?

06:40.680 --> 06:43.319
It's the energy reading. It's spiking.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.720
- Sheppard, come in.
-Go ahead.

06:46.800 --> 06:47.789
Something's happening.

06:47.880 --> 06:50.155
The energy reading,
it's going off the chart.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.435
- Do something. Turn it off.
- I don't know how.

06:52.520 --> 06:55.637
Look, it's not coming from
any of the main systems.

06:56.280 --> 06:57.474
LORNE ON RADIO: Colonel
Sheppard, this is Atlantis.

06:57.560 --> 07:00.154
We're picking up some kind of
power surge coming from the ship.

07:00.240 --> 07:03.835
Yeah, we noticed it. We're
trying to check it out ourselves.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.032
The levels are still rising.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.997
Colonel, should we send
another Jumper to assist?

07:08.080 --> 07:09.274
Stand by.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.634
All right, that's our cue to
leave. Everyone, back in the Jumper.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.639
- McKay, what the hell was that?
- I have no idea,

07:30.800 --> 07:33.951
but the energy reading's
gone back down the way it was.

07:36.280 --> 07:38.714
Atlantis, you reading anything unusual?

07:39.360 --> 07:40.952
Atlantis, come in.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.197
Atlantis, do you read?

07:47.960 --> 07:50.235
Colonel Sheppard, do you read?

07:51.240 --> 07:54.073
Daedalus, this is
Atlantis, please respond.

07:56.280 --> 07:58.475
- What the hell's going on?
-I don't know.

07:58.560 --> 08:02.394
One moment they were there, and
the next minute, they were gone.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.759
Rodney? I'm having problems
with communications.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.432
Can't reach Atlantis.

08:08.520 --> 08:11.512
Wait a second. That can't be right.

08:11.920 --> 08:12.989
What?

08:13.880 --> 08:16.314
I'm not seeing the city
on any of my screens.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.391
What are you talking about?

08:18.480 --> 08:21.756
I just did a sensor sweep, and
there's nothing down there but ocean.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.751
Well, maybe they cloaked.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.432
Well, they wouldn't have
done that without telling us.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.478
Well, I don't know, maybe
there's a Wraith ship in the area.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.516
I'm not reading anything.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.716
Are we certain it's the same planet?

08:32.799 --> 08:35.313
Perhaps the energy burst
shifted our position.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.073
No, according to our instruments,
we haven't moved at all.

08:38.159 --> 08:39.354
What do you want me to believe, Rodney?

08:39.440 --> 08:40.793
That Atlantis just disappeared?

08:40.880 --> 08:43.440
Look, I don't know. Just give me a
second, I'll figure it out, all right?

08:43.520 --> 08:45.431
In the meantime, I've managed
to localize the energy reading.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.829
It's coming from a hold on Deck 9.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.830
All right, keep trying to reach
Atlantis. We'll check it out.

09:02.720 --> 09:05.280
Sheppard, I think I've got something.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.112
It's the residual
radiation from the flash.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.794
It's similar to what happens
when you open a hyperspace window,

09:09.880 --> 09:12.633
but different enough that the sensors
wouldn't have picked it up automatically.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.392
What the hell does that mean?

09:14.480 --> 09:16.357
I think we're looking
at a new kind of drive.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.112
I thought you said
we didn't go anywhere.

09:18.200 --> 09:21.078
We didn't. At least not according
to the ship's navigational systems.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.515
So, a malfunctioning drive?

09:23.600 --> 09:25.318
Maybe. Just hang on.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.439
Oh, my God, Sheppard...

09:37.520 --> 09:38.555
Stand by, Rodney.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.471
No, you don't understand,
I know what it is.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.152
Look, the residual radiation,

09:42.240 --> 09:44.674
it's exactly what we recorded
when my double arrived on Atlantis

09:44.760 --> 09:46.398
from an alternate reality.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.152
I can't believe I
didn't see this before.

09:48.240 --> 09:49.229
Sheppard, hey.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.880
It's a drive, all right, but
it didn't move us through space.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.270
I think it's moved us
into a parallel universe.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.749
That would explain a lot of things.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.037
How long have they been dead for?

10:16.120 --> 10:18.076
This place was like a meat locker.

10:18.160 --> 10:21.197
They could've been preserved
like this for months.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.234
They look just like us.

10:24.320 --> 10:27.995
That's because they are us, the
alternate reality versions of us.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.071
I feel like someone just
walked over my grave.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.388
Take it easy. Everything's fine.

10:31.480 --> 10:34.597
- Oh, no, no, no, this is very bad.
- What?

10:34.680 --> 10:37.240
Look, this tablet belonged
to the other McKay.

10:37.320 --> 10:40.312
They weren't part of the original
crew. They came here just like us.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.834
Look, a ship appeared in
orbit over their Atlantis.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.478
They came to check it out.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.232
That would explain the
other Jumper in the bay.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.833
The ship jumped to another
reality and they were stuck,

10:47.920 --> 10:49.399
they couldn't get back.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.233
Look, eventually their
supplies ran out, and they...

10:52.320 --> 10:54.834
All right, all right,
mystery solved. Let's move on.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.115
No, don't you realize what this means?

10:57.200 --> 10:59.509
They were us, and they failed.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.672
Well, they're not us.
We're still alive. Let's go.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.716
The answer's in here somewhere.
Can you power up the systems?

11:13.800 --> 11:16.633
Yeah, just hold on.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.593
All right...

11:27.720 --> 11:29.870
All right, that's a start.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.598
What's behind here?

11:33.600 --> 11:35.431
That's a good question.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.519
I'm guessing that's our
alternate reality drive.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.114
Can you figure out how to control it?

11:57.520 --> 11:59.192
Offhand, I'd say no.

12:00.360 --> 12:03.830
That's what the other McKay was
trying to do, and he had weeks.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.148
Rodney...

12:05.600 --> 12:09.673
Fine. I'll start with his research.
It'll at least give us a head start.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.671
Yeah, that's better. We're
going to go look for supplies.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.830
What, you don't think the other us
wouldn't have already tried that?

12:13.920 --> 12:15.273
Get to work.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.471
Did you find anything?

12:32.560 --> 12:35.154
Not unless you know a way to cook this.

12:36.040 --> 12:40.318
Then perhaps we should consider going
down to the planet to collect supplies.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.753
Sheppard says it's too risky.

12:41.840 --> 12:44.070
The drive could kick in and the
ship could take off without us.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.037
Then we'd be stuck here.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.753
The others that we found,

12:49.840 --> 12:52.912
do you think their lives
were very similar to ours?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.274
Who cares?

12:55.680 --> 12:57.671
How can you say that?

12:57.760 --> 13:00.194
We've seen our doubles before.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.840
Replicator-manufactured copies.

13:02.920 --> 13:06.037
These were real people, with real lives.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.997
I can't help but wondering who
might still be waiting for her

13:08.080 --> 13:10.469
back on her Atlantis.

13:11.360 --> 13:14.033
Do you mean, did she also have a son?

13:14.120 --> 13:15.951
The thought had crossed my mind.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.359
Look, you know,

13:18.240 --> 13:20.629
I've heard McKay talk
about this stuff before,

13:20.720 --> 13:24.190
and supposedly, there's a million
different realities out there,

13:24.280 --> 13:26.430
with every possible variation,

13:26.520 --> 13:29.751
which also means there's a
million different Torrens.

13:30.480 --> 13:33.233
You going to worry
about every one of them?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.035
No.

13:35.680 --> 13:38.433
It's difficult enough
worrying about one.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.954
I'll bet it is. Come on.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.313
Why is the blast door closed?

13:52.400 --> 13:55.710
- Hello? Residual radiation?
- Oh, right.

13:56.320 --> 13:57.719
Have you made any progress?

13:57.800 --> 14:00.598
- As a matter of fact, yes, we have.
- "We"?

14:00.680 --> 14:03.478
Me and the other McKay, who,
unsurprisingly, is a genius.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.232
Not only that, but it looks
like the drive was created

14:05.320 --> 14:07.880
by yet another McKay
from the original reality.

14:07.960 --> 14:08.949
What makes you say that?

14:09.040 --> 14:12.316
Well, there's a certain elegance
to the design that I recognize.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.550
I'm sure that's what the crew was
saying when they abandoned ship.

14:14.640 --> 14:18.633
Well, admittedly there are problems,
but it is still a monumental achievement.

14:18.720 --> 14:22.110
All right. So, what do we do? Can
we just throw this thing in reverse?

14:22.200 --> 14:24.839
Yeah, it's a little more
complicated than that.

14:24.920 --> 14:26.399
The first problem is navigation.

14:26.480 --> 14:30.234
They've developed a coordinate system
to identify the various realities

14:30.320 --> 14:34.074
and allow them to get back,
but obviously that didn't work.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.195
Obviously.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.073
- That's not what bothers me.
- Well, do you know, it kind of bothers me.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.388
It's power generation.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.072
I mean, jumping from
one reality to another

14:42.160 --> 14:43.434
requires massive amounts of power.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.272
We're talking ZPM levels here.

14:45.360 --> 14:46.873
Obviously, they didn't have
one of those rattling around,

14:46.960 --> 14:48.871
so they created a capacitor

14:48.960 --> 14:51.838
that's constantly drawing
power from subspace.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.509
And it looks like it's almost charged.

14:55.600 --> 14:59.195
Is this your long-winded way of
telling me you just can't turn it off?

14:59.280 --> 15:01.748
Think of it like a tap
pouring water into a bucket.

15:01.840 --> 15:07.119
When the bucket is full, the drive engages,
except this particular tap has no valve.

15:07.760 --> 15:10.069
That seems like a pretty serious
design flaw, don't you think?

15:10.160 --> 15:12.549
Exactly. Which leads me to
believe they were tampering with it

15:12.640 --> 15:14.676
in a vain attempt to
generate more power.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.478
As they got further and
further from their own reality,

15:16.560 --> 15:19.074
I guess they figured
they'd need it to get back.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.594
And here we go.

15:28.520 --> 15:29.589
Okay.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.155
Where are we?

15:32.240 --> 15:33.434
Don't look at me.

15:33.520 --> 15:36.717
I haven't had time to route the
main systems to these control panels.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.836
I'm flying blind down here.

15:39.680 --> 15:42.240
- Ronon, Teyla, meet me at the bridge.
-On our way.

15:42.320 --> 15:43.992
- Keep it up, Rodney.
- Hmm.

15:48.840 --> 15:52.549
Colonel, Atlantis is back. I'm
picking them up on the sensors.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.191
You know how to work this stuff?

15:57.280 --> 16:00.317
The last time the Daedalus was in
orbit, Major Marks generously offered

16:00.400 --> 16:03.517
to give both of us some
preliminary training.

16:03.960 --> 16:07.032
- I was busy.
- Atlantis, this is Sheppard, come in.

16:08.640 --> 16:10.437
Atlantis, do you read?

16:15.160 --> 16:17.276
Atlantis, this is Sheppard, come in.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.794
Maybe they already have a Sheppard.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.915
Rodney, what are the odds

16:24.000 --> 16:28.391
of us randomly jumping
back into our own reality?

16:28.480 --> 16:29.549
I'd say slim to none.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.751
I'm detecting another ship in orbit.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.594
What kind?

16:34.680 --> 16:36.113
I'll see if I can pull it up on screen.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.272
I don't recognize it.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.599
What's that?

16:48.640 --> 16:51.279
-You know it?
- No.

16:51.360 --> 16:54.352
Colonel, I believe the
ship is powering weapons.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.548
- What's our shield status?
- Minimal.

17:06.440 --> 17:08.031
It's firing on Atlantis.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.916
The city's shields are failing.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.390
Rodney, do we have enough juice
to power up the Asgard beam?

17:13.480 --> 17:15.948
Maybe. I mean, you might be able
to get a couple of shots off. Why?

17:16.040 --> 17:18.599
There's some alien
ship attacking Atlantis.

17:18.680 --> 17:21.147
- So?
- What do you mean, "So?" It's Atlantis!

17:21.800 --> 17:23.438
It's not our Atlantis. We
have no idea who's down there.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.078
Look, we should just stay out of it.

17:25.160 --> 17:27.720
If we do not intervene,
the city will be destroyed.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.030
Yeah, we need help. My gut
tells me we're better off

17:30.120 --> 17:32.475
going with the people on that
planet than whoever's on that ship.

17:32.560 --> 17:35.279
-I hope you're right.
- Yeah, well, me too.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.794
The ship's been damaged.
It's stopped firing.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.836
Hopefully, we took out its main weapons.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.751
Wait, something's happening.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.996
They're launching fighters.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.074
Ronon...

18:07.960 --> 18:09.439
You should've took Marks
up when you had the chance.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.158
Now you're going to have to learn fast.

18:11.240 --> 18:13.549
Railgun targeting systems.

18:13.840 --> 18:17.037
Button's on the right. Control,
radar, tracking and target acquisition,

18:17.120 --> 18:19.156
use the red button to fire.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.955
- What the hell was that?
-We're under attack.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.110
Any chance of getting that
hyperdrive back online?

18:42.200 --> 18:44.919
No, it's completely shot!
I already told you that!

18:45.000 --> 18:46.149
Great.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.873
There's too many of
them. I can't do this.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.313
Keep trying!

19:14.200 --> 19:15.633
We've lost sublight.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.517
We have a hull breach.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.637
We're venting atmosphere.
I don't know what to do.

19:24.240 --> 19:27.357
Seal off damaged areas. We
should be okay for the moment.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.749
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.111
Sheppard, I have an idea!

19:33.200 --> 19:34.519
Let's hear it.

19:34.600 --> 19:35.749
I've set up a few protocols

19:35.840 --> 19:39.150
that should increase the efficiency
of the alternate reality drive.

19:39.240 --> 19:42.277
If I enable them, we might
be able to jump sooner.

19:42.360 --> 19:44.590
And what? What, jump
to the next universe?

19:44.680 --> 19:45.669
Exactly!

19:45.760 --> 19:48.069
But ifl do this, I can't undo it!

19:48.160 --> 19:51.277
I mean, we'll just start
jumping faster and faster!

19:54.480 --> 19:55.629
Do it.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.076
- It worked.
- Where are we?

20:19.240 --> 20:22.915
We have a problem. Temperature
in the hull is rising rapidly.

20:23.440 --> 20:25.237
What the hell is this?

20:32.800 --> 20:33.789
According to these readings,

20:33.880 --> 20:37.077
we're less than two million
kilometers from the surface of the sun.

20:37.160 --> 20:40.357
I thought we always jumped to
the same place in every reality.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.668
As did I.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.397
Hull temperature is
approaching critical.

20:46.480 --> 20:49.790
- If we do not restore shields...
- We're going to burn.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.311
Are you sure about this?

20:55.400 --> 20:57.516
Well, we're not imagining it, Rodney.

20:57.600 --> 21:01.149
All right. Well, let me transfer the sensors
down to the station. Then at least I can...

21:01.240 --> 21:02.229
Oh.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.517
You're definitely not imagining that.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.830
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
-I don't understand it.

21:06.920 --> 21:09.195
We always jump to the same
relative position in space.

21:10.360 --> 21:13.158
- Unless...
-Unless what?

21:13.720 --> 21:14.789
You said when you went to the future,

21:14.880 --> 21:17.678
you saw our sun expanding
into a red giant, remember?

21:17.760 --> 21:19.318
What are you saying, we're
jumping through time now?

21:19.400 --> 21:21.960
No, no, no, no, no, but
maybe what eventually happens

21:22.040 --> 21:25.237
in our reality is happening
in this one, only much sooner.

21:25.320 --> 21:28.676
Look, we didn't go to the
sun. The sun came to us.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.830
So how does this help us?

21:30.920 --> 21:33.878
I don't know. I just...
I found it interesting.

21:34.600 --> 21:39.355
What's interesting, Rodney, is a way
out of this without getting fried,

21:39.440 --> 21:42.910
like getting the sublight back on
so we can get the hell out of here.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.479
Actually, I think our best bet

21:44.560 --> 21:46.994
is just to transfer as much
power as we can to the shields,

21:47.080 --> 21:49.275
and ride it out till the next jump.

21:49.360 --> 21:50.713
When does that happen?

21:50.800 --> 21:52.870
Well, the time the capacitor
takes to charge is different

21:52.960 --> 21:55.394
now that I've enacted
those new protocols.

21:55.480 --> 21:59.029
You know... I have no idea.

21:59.120 --> 22:01.429
You're not exactly
selling the plan, Rodney.

22:01.520 --> 22:04.398
I have no idea how long it would
take me to fix the sublights either!

22:04.600 --> 22:05.749
Look, I've got to run a diagnostic,

22:05.840 --> 22:09.515
but theoretically, transferring power
to the shields should be relatively easy.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.431
All right, what do we do?

22:11.520 --> 22:13.909
All right, the first thing I need
you to do is head down to engineering.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.228
Let's go.

22:26.960 --> 22:29.349
All right, we're here. What do we do?

22:29.440 --> 22:31.954
I need you to kill all
power to non-essential decks,

22:32.040 --> 22:33.109
which means you're
going to have to access

22:33.200 --> 22:35.031
the main administrative interface.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.874
That should bring up a list of
all available override commands.

22:43.560 --> 22:44.913
Got it.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.753
Okay. So choose the
command for life support.

22:47.840 --> 22:51.150
You're going to have to
designate the decks one by one.

23:34.560 --> 23:37.279
- I think that's all of them.
-Damn it.

23:37.360 --> 23:39.510
That didn't buy us nearly as much
power as I would have thought.

23:39.600 --> 23:42.433
- Well, there's got to be something else.
- Right...

23:42.520 --> 23:44.636
All right, look, the ship
has auxiliary power modules

23:44.720 --> 23:46.233
for most of the main systems.

23:46.320 --> 23:48.311
Most likely they're
depleted, but ifnot, well,

23:48.400 --> 23:49.992
it might buy us a little more juice.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.752
Well, there you go.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.870
What the hell was that? Was it gunfire?

24:06.960 --> 24:08.359
Where's Ronon?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.433
Keep working.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.838
Stay focused, Rodney.

24:14.920 --> 24:17.354
- Tell me what to do next.
- All right.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.277
- You okay?
- Yeah.

24:35.160 --> 24:37.435
Where the hell did he come from?

24:39.760 --> 24:41.193
Check it out.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.272
It's the same symbol that
was on the alien ship.

24:44.960 --> 24:46.712
How'd he get onboard?

24:46.800 --> 24:50.793
You know, they crashed into us,
penetrated our hull, remember?

24:51.480 --> 24:54.711
- You think he did it on purpose?
- That's a good question.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.715
Hey.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.392
Let me try that.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.716
That's it. That's all of them.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.153
I must go help Colonel
Sheppard and Ronon.

25:13.240 --> 25:16.312
- Good luck, Rodney.
-No, no, no, it's not enough!

25:17.120 --> 25:19.793
- What do you mean?
- Without sublights, our orbit is decaying,

25:19.880 --> 25:22.633
which means more radiation
slamming into the shields.

25:22.720 --> 25:25.359
The alternate reality drive
is only charged to 70%,

25:25.440 --> 25:27.670
which means it'll never make
100 before the shields fail.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.671
Well, what do we do?
We have no more power.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.277
Just give me a second.

25:42.920 --> 25:45.514
Rodney, Colonel Sheppard
and Ronon are under attack.

25:47.080 --> 25:49.116
All right, I got it, I
got it. Drop the shields.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.633
- What?
- Drop the shields.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.631
I will transfer all
available power to the drive.

25:52.720 --> 25:54.392
Hopefully, it'll be
enough to induce a jump.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.471
- Hopefully?
- It is our only option,

25:56.560 --> 25:59.711
and every second we argue about it is
less of a chance it's going to work!

26:00.320 --> 26:02.390
Very well. Dropping shields.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.555
Hull temperature is passing critical.

26:09.640 --> 26:12.359
Okay, transferring
power to the drive now.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.351
- Oh. No, no, no, no.
-What is it?

26:17.440 --> 26:19.670
It's not enough. It's only 98%!

26:21.440 --> 26:24.273
Rodney, the hull is
beginning to deteriorate.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.632
Come on, come on!

26:31.680 --> 26:34.114
That's it! Sheppard, we're jumping!

26:50.640 --> 26:52.278
Nice work, Rodney.

26:52.760 --> 26:55.832
Uh, you may want to hold
off on the congratulations.

26:55.920 --> 26:57.114
Now what?

26:57.200 --> 26:59.316
I think I've overtaxed the drive.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.038
Look, it's not completely blown,

27:01.120 --> 27:04.157
but we've only got a handful
of jumps before it's burned out.

27:04.240 --> 27:05.958
All right, then what happens?

27:06.040 --> 27:10.158
If we haven't found our way back by
then, we will be stranded forever.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.199
What happened to the planet?

27:19.280 --> 27:22.078
Rodney believes that in this reality,
it was destroyed by an impact,

27:22.160 --> 27:25.835
possibly millions of years ago. All
that remains is this asteroid field.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.797
All right, I think I got something.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.711
In fact, it was staring me
in the face the whole time.

27:29.800 --> 27:31.074
I was just too busy trying
to avoid imminent death

27:31.160 --> 27:32.718
- to notice it.
- What are you talking about?

27:32.800 --> 27:34.836
See, my mistake was focusing
on the navigation system.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.478
I should've known that
was never going to work.

27:36.560 --> 27:37.549
So what, then?

27:37.640 --> 27:40.996
So, in a spectacular feat of
multi-dimensional mathematics,

27:41.080 --> 27:42.911
I have discovered a way
to send the ship back

27:43.000 --> 27:44.479
along the path it's previously traveled,

27:44.560 --> 27:46.391
bypassing the navigation
system altogether.

27:46.480 --> 27:47.469
Wait a minute.

27:47.560 --> 27:49.949
You're talking about putting
this thing in reverse?

27:50.040 --> 27:53.112
- Exactly.
- I just suggested that two hours ago.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.838
And naturally, I
dismissed it out of hand,

27:54.920 --> 27:56.956
but then I realized that
including the original designer,

27:57.040 --> 28:00.555
not one, but two versions of myself
have failed to make this thing work.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.039
I had to think not like me.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.189
In fact, I had to think
like the opposite of me,

28:03.280 --> 28:04.838
and it doesn't get much
more opposite than you.

28:04.920 --> 28:06.876
I'll take that as a compliment.

28:06.960 --> 28:09.190
- So can we get back or not?
- Well, not directly.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.191
It's impossible to calculate

28:11.280 --> 28:13.032
the relative position of
our original starting point

28:13.120 --> 28:15.680
from where we are now, but
we can retrace our steps,

28:15.760 --> 28:18.479
passing through each reality in
turn until we reach the right one.

28:18.560 --> 28:22.951
Well, there's a slight problem, Rodney.
We barely got out of those realities alive.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.155
If we do not restore the shields,

28:24.240 --> 28:26.071
the radiation from the
red giant will kill us.

28:26.160 --> 28:27.229
Not necessarily.

28:27.320 --> 28:30.073
Look, we know that the ship
carries its momentum in real space

28:30.160 --> 28:31.559
from one reality to the next.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.632
Now, we may not have sublight engines,
but we do have maneuvering thrusters.

28:34.720 --> 28:37.439
You know, one long continuous
burn along the right trajectory

28:37.520 --> 28:39.272
from now until the next jump
should be enough to allow us

28:39.360 --> 28:41.954
to establish a higher, more
stable orbit around the sun.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.996
So the radiation will not affect us?

28:44.080 --> 28:47.152
I wouldn't go that far, but,
still, it'd be not quite as deadly?

28:48.320 --> 28:49.719
Okay. That's it.

28:50.200 --> 28:51.599
Course is already plotted.

28:51.680 --> 28:52.795
What about those alien dudes?

28:52.880 --> 28:54.313
They know we're the
ones that shot at them.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.470
- Maybe they'll be gone.
-I wouldn't count on it.

28:56.560 --> 29:00.269
I mean, time is passing at the same rate
in each of the realities, which means...

29:00.360 --> 29:02.078
Well, which means, it
hasn't been that long.

29:02.160 --> 29:05.596
To get past those aliens, we're
going to need sublight engines,

29:05.680 --> 29:07.352
and I'm going to need
to fix them in time.

29:07.440 --> 29:09.351
Wait, but you said you don't
even know what's wrong with those.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.555
Well, I haven't had a
chance to check it out.

29:10.640 --> 29:13.313
I'm sorry I can't do 10 things at once.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.834
I've already told you, the
drive is going to burn out, soon.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.319
We have to do something.

29:17.400 --> 29:20.472
Who's to say the next
reality won't be even worse?

29:28.320 --> 29:31.869
All right, all the modifications
to the drive are in place.

29:32.360 --> 29:33.713
Here we go.

29:48.960 --> 29:51.110
It worked. You did it, Rodney.

29:51.880 --> 29:54.235
All right, I'm going to
head up to engineering,

29:54.560 --> 29:56.710
get to work on the sublights.

29:59.680 --> 30:00.795
What's our status?

30:00.880 --> 30:03.713
Hull temperature is rising, but
not as rapidly as it did before.

30:03.800 --> 30:04.994
I think we'll be okay.

30:05.080 --> 30:08.470
So much for the frying pan. Let's
hope we make it through the fire.

30:12.760 --> 30:14.318
-How is it coming?
- Hmm?

30:14.400 --> 30:16.311
It's not good.

30:16.400 --> 30:19.597
The main systems are completely fried.
I'm going to have to do a full bypass.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.716
- Can I be of assistance?
- I doubt it.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.392
Okay...

30:24.320 --> 30:26.550
Oh, jeez! What the...

30:33.760 --> 30:34.795
Thanks.

30:34.880 --> 30:38.998
Perhaps a separate diagnostic of
the auxiliary system might be useful.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.635
Uh, sure.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.631
I wanted to thank you, Rodney.

30:48.720 --> 30:49.948
For what?

30:50.480 --> 30:52.118
For not giving up.

30:53.800 --> 30:56.712
Oh, I know what this is.
It's your first mission back.

30:56.800 --> 30:59.872
Look, I am not about to
let it be your last, okay?

31:02.200 --> 31:04.668
Oh, no, that's what I was afraid of.

31:04.760 --> 31:06.478
-What is it?
- Well, the drive's charging

31:06.560 --> 31:07.595
a lot faster now.

31:07.680 --> 31:08.669
Sheppard!

31:08.760 --> 31:11.069
Looks like the next jump's going to
happen a lot sooner than we thought.

31:11.160 --> 31:13.435
How's it coming with
the sublight engine?

31:13.520 --> 31:15.238
I'm going to need a few minutes.

31:15.320 --> 31:18.118
- Do we have a few more minutes?
- I doubt it.

31:18.920 --> 31:21.753
All right, let's split railgun positions.
I'll take forward, you take aft.

31:21.840 --> 31:23.319
You really think that's
going to make a difference?

31:23.400 --> 31:28.349
Without shields, probably not,
but we don't have much of a choice.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.116
Where's the alien ship?

31:40.200 --> 31:41.633
I'm not sure.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.313
Well, maybe they left.

31:45.720 --> 31:48.234
No such luck. They're right behind us.

31:58.360 --> 32:01.158
We got fighters closing in on our
position. How's it going down there?

32:01.240 --> 32:03.310
Look, just give me a second!

32:07.280 --> 32:08.793
Rodney...

32:08.880 --> 32:10.438
Okay, try it now.

32:15.160 --> 32:18.038
That's it, I've got it! Go! Go! Go! Go!

32:31.400 --> 32:32.753
Sheppard...

32:33.640 --> 32:35.073
How we doing?

32:35.880 --> 32:38.792
They're gaining on us.
Can you get us more speed?

32:38.880 --> 32:41.519
There's not a chance! Look, I've
barely got this thing working as it is!

32:41.600 --> 32:44.160
If we tax it any more, we're
going to blow the whole system!

32:44.240 --> 32:47.198
All right, well, then
we've got a real problem.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.671
They're in weapons range.

32:58.160 --> 33:00.071
- Return fire.
- I'm trying.

33:14.240 --> 33:16.515
Easy, Chewie, those
buttons are your friends.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.750
- Just keep trying.
- I'm trying!

33:21.600 --> 33:24.114
That's it, sublights are
gone for good this time!

33:43.960 --> 33:47.316
- What the hell
was that? - F-302s.

33:48.480 --> 33:49.959
It's Atlantis.

34:08.639 --> 34:09.958
What's happening?

34:10.040 --> 34:12.270
Looks like we're getting
some help from some friends.

34:12.360 --> 34:14.635
Guess we bet on the
right side after all.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.995
Daedalus, this is Lieutenant
Colonel John Sheppard.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.433
Do you read?

34:20.080 --> 34:21.911
Daedalus, do you read?

34:24.000 --> 34:26.753
Yeah, Daedalus. This
is Daedalus. Come in.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.311
Who... Who is this?

34:29.600 --> 34:31.397
It's a long story.

34:31.480 --> 34:33.152
Well, whoever you are,
you saved our asses

34:33.239 --> 34:34.753
when you took out their main weapons.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.274
Figured the least we could
do is return the fa vor.

34:37.360 --> 34:38.918
Much appreciated.

34:40.280 --> 34:41.632
Sheppard...

34:48.040 --> 34:49.268
Oh, crap.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.314
Sorry about that.

34:59.400 --> 35:02.358
One of them got through.
Nice shooting, though.

35:03.320 --> 35:04.514
Thanks.

35:24.760 --> 35:26.910
All right, looks like
that's the last of them.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.673
So... So, what happens now?

35:29.760 --> 35:31.671
Well, we go our own ways.

35:31.760 --> 35:33.239
Just like that?

35:33.760 --> 35:34.909
Pretty much.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.072
Well, the thing is, we
do have a few questions.

35:38.160 --> 35:42.278
See, the Daedalus we know
was destroyed two years ago

35:42.360 --> 35:43.873
in a battle with the Replicators.

35:43.960 --> 35:45.678
Sorry to hear that,

35:45.760 --> 35:50.675
but this isn't exactly our Daedalus,
we're just borrowing it for a while.

35:51.280 --> 35:54.272
Okay, I have no idea what that means.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.555
Like I said, it's a long story.

35:56.960 --> 35:59.554
All right, Daedalus, good luck.

35:59.640 --> 36:04.873
Thank you, Colonel, and one
last thing, it's been a pleasure.

36:05.480 --> 36:08.631
You're obviously a
man of great integrity

36:08.720 --> 36:12.679
and a dedicated commander
and a very skilled pilot.

36:13.440 --> 36:16.796
Well, that's funny. I was
going to say the same to you.

36:26.640 --> 36:28.756
All right. The alien ship's gone.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.910
I'm reading a planet
with no energy signatures.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.709
It's the first reality we jumped
to. One more, and we're home.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.629
Let's get down to the hangar bay.

36:45.640 --> 36:46.914
All right.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.239
I got shot!

36:59.880 --> 37:02.030
- I thought we got them all.
- Apparently not.

37:10.440 --> 37:11.714
Think there's any more of them?

37:11.800 --> 37:14.268
I'm not waiting around to find out.

37:20.080 --> 37:21.672
Move, move, move!

37:34.040 --> 37:35.632
The explosion's caused a hull breach.

37:35.720 --> 37:38.280
Whole sections have been
de-pressurized, including the hangar bay!

37:38.360 --> 37:39.952
And we just lost the Jumpers!

37:40.040 --> 37:42.998
Our stop is coming up, Rodney.
It's time to get off this train.

37:43.080 --> 37:44.354
Look, there's no way off.

37:44.440 --> 37:45.919
Once we jump into our own reality,

37:46.000 --> 37:47.797
Atlantis will detect us
and they will send help.

37:47.880 --> 37:50.758
We broke orbit to get away
from the fighters, remember?

37:50.840 --> 37:52.193
Look, we carry our momentum

37:52.280 --> 37:54.510
and relative position in space
from one reality to the next,

37:54.600 --> 37:55.794
which means by the time we next jump,

37:55.880 --> 37:58.235
we're going to be, like,
half a million kilometers out.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.993
They're never going
to get to us in time!

38:01.440 --> 38:04.318
We got C4, I say we wait till we get
back and then we'll blow the drive.

38:04.400 --> 38:07.597
That could work, or it could tear
a hole in the space-time continuum

38:07.680 --> 38:10.717
not only killing us, but
destroying the entire solar system!

38:10.800 --> 38:13.439
Well, we better think of something fast.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.630
Another contact just
appeared on our screens.

38:23.720 --> 38:24.709
Is it the Daedalus?

38:24.800 --> 38:27.234
They're too far out for us to get IFF.

38:27.320 --> 38:28.719
Try subspace.

38:30.280 --> 38:32.430
Colonel Sheppard, do you read?

38:33.760 --> 38:36.911
Colonel Sheppard, this is
Major Lorne, do you read?

38:37.840 --> 38:39.432
- Was there a hyperspace window?
- No, sir.

38:39.520 --> 38:41.317
They just appeared out of nowhere.

38:41.400 --> 38:42.674
Well, it's got to be them.

38:42.760 --> 38:46.275
Alert Mr. Woolsey. Doc, you're
with me. Let's go, come on.

38:50.120 --> 38:53.795
All right, we should
be within radio range.

38:53.880 --> 38:55.836
Colonel Sheppard, come in.

38:57.240 --> 38:59.708
Dr. McKay, this is
Major Lorne. Do you read?

38:59.800 --> 39:01.199
No, there's too much interference.

39:02.600 --> 39:05.353
I'm picking up some
kind of energy reading.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.033
It's spiking.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.510
What the hell just happened?

39:17.840 --> 39:20.070
- They disappeared.
-  What are you talking about?

39:20.160 --> 39:22.833
Well, they're just gone.

39:25.840 --> 39:27.273
Oh, wait a minute.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.831
I'm picking up four lifesigns.

39:29.920 --> 39:31.433
Okay, where?

39:31.520 --> 39:32.839
Dead ahead.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.711
Colonel Sheppard, is that you?

39:42.800 --> 39:45.189
Major, nice of you to stop by.

39:45.280 --> 39:48.238
Kind ofhard to get a
cab in this neighborhood.

39:49.280 --> 39:50.508
Yes, sir.

40:00.040 --> 40:03.430
How many jumps you think that drive
has left in it before it burns out?

40:03.520 --> 40:05.750
Half a dozen, tops. Then
it'll be completely inert.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.353
Good. I'd hate to think of somebody else

40:07.440 --> 40:09.715
getting trapped inside
that thing like we did.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.028
Actually, you know, I've
been thinking about that.

40:11.120 --> 40:13.190
Now, true, the navigation
system was flawed to start,

40:13.280 --> 40:16.158
but the basic principles of the
drive are fundamentally sound...

40:16.240 --> 40:18.310
- Forget it, Rodney.
- I've saved the relevant data.

40:18.400 --> 40:19.435
Minor adjustments, and I should be able

40:19.520 --> 40:22.910
- to have this thing up and running...
- Like I said, forget it.

40:23.240 --> 40:25.151
Hey, look who's here.

40:25.240 --> 40:26.468
How's your shoulder, Rodney?

40:26.560 --> 40:29.518
It's pretty bad, but,
you know, better, thanks.

40:30.320 --> 40:32.515
Is it well enough to hold him?

40:34.760 --> 40:35.909
Really?

40:39.600 --> 40:41.989
- Don't drop him.
- Thank you.

40:48.160 --> 40:49.991
Hey there, little guy.

40:50.640 --> 40:53.279
- I think he likes me.
-It suits you.

40:53.360 --> 40:54.509
You think so?

40:54.600 --> 40:57.592
I think you'll make an
excellent father someday.

41:00.520 --> 41:05.435
I've seen a lot of scary things in my
time, but that thought scares me the most.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.598
- Do you want to...
- I think so.

41:09.680 --> 41:12.399
Yeah. There you go.
Watch out, they wiggle.

41:13.880 --> 41:15.029
Right.
