WEBVTT

00:13.147 --> 00:18.519
Look alive! Look alive!

00:18.552 --> 00:19.487
Get up. Get up.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.655
(grunts)

00:24.525 --> 00:25.526
Come on.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.361
(groaning)

00:29.830 --> 00:31.332
(groaning)

00:31.365 --> 00:32.733
Back off...

00:34.568 --> 00:35.736
(grunts)

00:35.769 --> 00:36.670
Stop!

00:36.704 --> 00:38.172
Stop!

00:38.206 --> 00:41.542
Stop! Back off!

00:41.575 --> 00:42.843
What the hell
is wrong with you?

00:42.876 --> 00:44.112
You're a sparring partner.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.115
You okay, Pete?

00:48.816 --> 00:50.184
Pete!

00:50.218 --> 00:51.452
Listen up.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.655
There's no pulse.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.361
(crickets chirping)

01:03.864 --> 01:05.833
Three sixes.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.268
Beat that.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.602
(clicks tongue)

01:08.636 --> 01:11.205
Flush. All hearts.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.141
-You should have folded.
-Hmm.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.508
I was feeling lucky.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.344
There was a less
than an 18%

01:16.377 --> 01:18.346
probability that you were gonna
complete that flush.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.780
-You really should have...
-Hmm.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.615
-...folded.
-Charlie,

01:21.649 --> 01:23.651
how long are we
gonna play poker?

01:23.684 --> 01:25.786
The Texas Hold 'Em tournament
is coming up, yeah?

01:25.819 --> 01:27.721
Yes, I know, and
you promised Larry

01:27.755 --> 01:29.190
that you would
defend his title.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.758
That's right,
against Professor Novich.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.860
Okay, who's practically a
professional poker player.

01:32.893 --> 01:33.861
A big jerk.

01:33.894 --> 01:36.397
Your father is out of
town for the weekend,

01:36.430 --> 01:39.567
and we have the house
all to ourselves.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.707
(doorbell ringing)

01:47.908 --> 01:49.577
Wait. You know what?

01:49.610 --> 01:50.744
Hold that thought.

01:50.778 --> 01:51.879
I think that's dinner.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.181
ALAN:
Oh, thanks...

01:53.214 --> 01:54.348
(door closing)

01:54.382 --> 01:56.550
(sighs)

01:56.584 --> 01:57.751
-Uh...
-Dad...

01:57.785 --> 01:59.420
I-I caught
the delivery boy

01:59.453 --> 02:01.155
at the door.

02:01.189 --> 02:03.324
My meeting was over,
so I, uh, caught the last plane.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.792
I, uh, think
I'm interrupting.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.160
I should... I, uh, I...

02:06.194 --> 02:07.428
I-I should leave.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.297
AMITA:
No, um,

02:09.330 --> 02:11.465
you should...
have dinner with us.

02:11.499 --> 02:12.733
There's...
there's plenty.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.503
Charlie always orders too much
food anyway.

02:15.536 --> 02:16.837
Really?

02:16.870 --> 02:19.573
Because I'm starving.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.612
I'm looking
for Larson, Homicide.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.314
Thanks.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.882
Hey. David Sinclair, FBI.

02:28.916 --> 02:29.750
I got your call.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.785
One of my suspects
dropped your name.

02:31.819 --> 02:32.786
Called you
as a courtesy.

02:32.820 --> 02:33.954
Dropped my name?

02:33.987 --> 02:36.357
Guy over there--
Ben Ellis.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.694
So, you do
know this guy?

02:40.728 --> 02:42.496
Yeah, I know him.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.198
What happened?

02:44.232 --> 02:46.800
How much have you heard about
mixed martial arts fighting?

02:46.834 --> 02:48.869
Um, it's like,
uh, kickboxing

02:48.902 --> 02:50.471
with some judo
and stuff, right?

02:50.504 --> 02:51.872
-Yeah, kind of.
-(camera shutter clicking)

02:51.905 --> 02:53.274
Anyway,
the deceased,

02:53.307 --> 02:54.675
Pete Munson,
was gearing up

02:54.708 --> 02:56.710
for an All-Out
Fighting qualifier

02:56.744 --> 02:57.945
against Ken Bainsworth.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.947
Qualifier for what?
Mind if I take a look?

02:59.980 --> 03:01.315
Go ahead.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.550
If he beat Bainsworth,

03:02.583 --> 03:04.752
he was gonna get a shot
at the champ.

03:04.785 --> 03:05.919
And Ellis?

03:05.953 --> 03:06.954
The training partner.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.522
Landed a punch,

03:08.556 --> 03:10.458
Munson went down,
never came up.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.660
Fighter dying in a ring
is a tragedy,

03:12.693 --> 03:14.728
but not necessarily a homicide.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.597
ME's talking
about Munson being drugged.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.966
Drugged? With what?

03:18.999 --> 03:19.933
Won't know until the autopsy.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.869
Why is Ben a suspect?

03:21.902 --> 03:24.572
LARSON: Same thing happened
six months ago.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.274
Ben was in a training match
in Vegas.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.276
Other guy, fighter
named Octavio Lopez,

03:28.309 --> 03:29.943
also died in the ring.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.912
Was Lopez drugged as well?

03:31.945 --> 03:33.013
We're looking into that
right now.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.682
Meantime, we're putting together
a list of everybody

03:34.715 --> 03:36.717
who was at either gym
the day of each death.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.586
Mind if I talk to him?

03:38.619 --> 03:39.953
Be my guest.

03:39.987 --> 03:42.990
(camera shutter clicking)

03:43.023 --> 03:44.858
Guys, have a second?

03:50.398 --> 03:51.932
Long time no see.

03:51.965 --> 03:54.802
Look, I didn't know who
else to call, all right?

03:56.804 --> 03:58.038
So is it bad?

03:58.071 --> 04:00.040
Cop says it's a burner.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.643
Burner?

04:02.676 --> 04:04.878
I just threw a couple punches.

04:04.912 --> 04:05.946
That's it.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.047
Is that right?

04:07.080 --> 04:09.983
Yeah, that's is.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.486
Cop told me
about the other fight.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.887
The guy in Vegas.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.557
Look, I have no idea
what's going on.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.426
-I swear. -LARSON:
Just talked to a witness

04:18.459 --> 04:20.060
who said you threatened Munson
earlier today.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.429
I didn't
threaten anybody.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.896
Then you won't mind
giving me

04:22.930 --> 04:24.698
a statement
at the station.

04:24.732 --> 04:27.034
What? You're
arresting me?

04:27.067 --> 04:28.436
Just want to hear your side.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.871
If you want,
Agent Sinclair can be there.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.042
(quietly): You just don't say
anything till I get there.

04:35.075 --> 04:37.010
Okay?

04:45.419 --> 04:48.088
Raise ten.

04:48.121 --> 04:48.989
I'm out.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.624
Too rich for me.

04:50.658 --> 04:51.592
Ten dollars is too rich for you?

04:51.625 --> 04:52.926
Yeah.

04:52.960 --> 04:53.961
Unlucky in love.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.796
I didn't plan
on any of this.

04:55.829 --> 04:56.997
Oh, Charlie,
I'm kidding.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.099
-I'm having a great time. -DON:
Yeah, well, you're winning.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.968
Of course you're having fun.
I'd be having fun, too.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.803
-I'm out.
-(doorbell rings)

05:02.836 --> 05:03.937
I'll get it.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.473
I got it!

05:05.506 --> 05:07.575
You know, you have
a seriously strange concept

05:07.608 --> 05:08.876
of a romantic evening.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.478
Who the hell is this now?

05:10.511 --> 05:11.945
Hi.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.448
I'm sorry to bother you
so late, Don.

05:14.482 --> 05:15.949
DON:
What? Everything all right?

05:15.983 --> 05:17.818
I kind of want to talk
to Charlie about something.

05:17.851 --> 05:18.652
Yeah, yeah,
come on in.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.754
What's up, David?

05:20.788 --> 05:21.655
Hello, David.

05:21.689 --> 05:22.923
How you doing,
Mr. Eppes?

05:22.956 --> 05:23.824
I'm sorry
to interrupt you guys.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.793
-No, it's all right.
-I wanted to know

05:25.826 --> 05:26.760
if I could get some help
on something.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.862
A guy I know got into
a little bit of trouble.

05:28.896 --> 05:31.699
What kind of trouble?

05:31.732 --> 05:32.966
He's a mixed
martial arts fighter.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.635
He's in a sparring
session;

05:34.668 --> 05:35.969
he threw a punch;

05:36.003 --> 05:39.707
and, uh, the other fighter...
he died.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.675
-That's awful.
-Yeah.

05:41.709 --> 05:42.943
It gets a little worse.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.144
Um, six months ago,

05:44.177 --> 05:46.380
the same thing happened.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.649
Another sparring session,
and that guy died, as well.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.818
Trouble seems
to follow your friend.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.520
Yeah, always has.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.722
Um, LAPD thinks
the two fighters

05:54.755 --> 05:55.723
could have
been drugged.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.124
What, so they're looking
at your friend for this?

05:57.157 --> 05:58.392
Yeah.

05:58.426 --> 05:59.493
What can I do?

05:59.527 --> 06:01.595
I'm hoping you could do
something like what you did

06:01.629 --> 06:03.030
with the Syntel
shareholders

06:03.063 --> 06:05.165
when that-that corporate
whistleblower was killed.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.468
Okay, so you have a large list
of potential suspects.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.502
Yeah. Actually, I have two.

06:08.536 --> 06:11.439
This list is everybody
that was at the gym tonight.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.907
And I'm waiting on a second list
to come in from Las Vegas

06:13.941 --> 06:15.075
where the other fighter died.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.611
I know it's a lot, Charlie,

06:17.645 --> 06:18.612
but there's a lot of overlap.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.113
-About 100 names.
-(playing cards flapping)

06:20.147 --> 06:22.716
Spectators, trainers,
some fighters.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.588
What if we construe

06:27.621 --> 06:29.857
the precipitating events for
the two murders as appropriate

06:29.890 --> 06:31.759
for a Kruskal Count?

06:31.792 --> 06:32.926
That's creative.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.828
We could, um, look
for the linkages

06:34.862 --> 06:36.163
and find any key pattern.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.731
You know, you
may help us

06:37.765 --> 06:39.767
narrow down the lists to a few

06:39.800 --> 06:41.569
key suspects.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.437
-Mm-hmm.
-Or maybe just one.

06:43.471 --> 06:46.707
I mean, um... your friend.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.650
My witness says
you threatened Munson.

06:56.684 --> 06:59.019
Said you'd
kill him.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.755
Wasn't like that.

07:01.789 --> 07:04.625
So, you don't deny
saying it?

07:04.658 --> 07:06.860
DAVID:
Why don't you tell

07:06.894 --> 07:09.897
the detective what it was like?

07:09.930 --> 07:10.931
We were just talking

07:10.964 --> 07:13.601
about what would happen
in the ring-- me and him.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.636
And you said you'd kill him.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.871
It's a figure of speech,
Detective.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.874
Doesn't look like a figure
of speech to me.

07:22.743 --> 07:23.844
Does it look like a figure
of speech

07:23.877 --> 07:25.479
to you,
Agent Sinclair?

07:25.513 --> 07:27.481
Are you ready to charge him?

07:27.515 --> 07:28.882
No, I'm not.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.584
So he's free to go then.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.489
You need to stay
in Los Angeles,

07:35.523 --> 07:36.490
Mr. Ellis.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.591
Why?

07:37.625 --> 07:38.759
Because you're
a material witness

07:38.792 --> 07:41.529
in a murder investigation.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.771
You need
to get yourself a lawyer.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.807
So this is how it's gonna be?

07:53.841 --> 07:55.075
Just get yourself
a good lawyer, Ben.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.243
You don't know anybody,

07:56.276 --> 07:57.277
I'll make a phone call.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.780
I should have known
you would take their side.

07:59.813 --> 08:00.914
I am down here

08:00.948 --> 08:03.584
in the middle of the night
helping you out, am I not?

08:03.617 --> 08:04.885
Yeah.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.655
At least that much has changed.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.025
(sighs)

08:12.059 --> 08:14.795
DON:
So, more people

08:14.828 --> 08:18.131
watched mixed martial arts fight
on pay-per-view

08:18.165 --> 08:20.901
than a baseball playoff game
on network TV.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.202
Yeah, this is big business.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.604
I saw Larry Alston

08:23.637 --> 08:24.938
on the news
the other night.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.840
-Well, who's that?
-Larry Alston?

08:26.874 --> 08:29.176
He's the guy that partnered up
with all the big casino money

08:29.209 --> 08:30.177
and bought the All-Out
Fighting League.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.913
He's trying to clean it up,
take it mainstream.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.616
Yeah, well, this whole thing
ain't gonna help, huh?

08:35.649 --> 08:36.817
Yeah. Neither is
losing his fighter.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.019
I mean, it's not that Munson
could have taken Tino Alva.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.253
Oh, who's that?

08:40.287 --> 08:41.855
Alva's the AFL's champion.

08:41.889 --> 08:42.856
Well, so, how you know all this?

08:42.890 --> 08:46.026
The guys I teach Krav Maga to
are way into it.

08:46.059 --> 08:49.096
They're so excited for
that Alva-Bainsworth rematch.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.764
Why are we looking
at this?

08:50.798 --> 08:53.734
I thought the thing
with David's friend was LAPD.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.169
Yeah, well, it might be two
murders in two states, right?

08:56.203 --> 08:59.573
Meanwhile, we're just playing
a supporting role for now.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.208
Just got off
with the Vegas ME.

09:01.241 --> 09:04.244
They found a heart defect
in Lopez's autopsy.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.079
The death was ruled accidental.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.115
So, the other fighter
wasn't drugged?

09:08.148 --> 09:10.250
They stopped looking
once they found the defect,

09:10.283 --> 09:12.352
so they're gonna pull
an archived tissue sample

09:12.385 --> 09:13.420
and take
another look.

09:13.453 --> 09:15.288
All right, meanwhile,
Charlie's gonna need data,

09:15.322 --> 09:17.324
so we'll start looking
into their background,

09:17.357 --> 09:20.027
and we'll talk to this guy,
uh, Larry Alston?

09:20.060 --> 09:22.262
I thought this was
an LAPD Homicide.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.865
Yeah, key suspect's a guy I know
from the old neighborhood.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.266
New York, right?

09:26.299 --> 09:27.668
Yeah, Bronx.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.069
What can you tell me?

09:29.102 --> 09:31.338
Munson was killed
with 1080 poison.

09:31.371 --> 09:32.973
Poison?

09:33.006 --> 09:36.877
1080 is the brand name
for sodium fluoroacetate.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.212
It disrupts the body's
ability to process oxygen,

09:39.246 --> 09:41.048
induces cardiac arrest.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.149
To be honest, I
almost missed it.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.316
So, it's pretty hard to detect?

09:43.350 --> 09:45.385
Unless you're
looking for it, but

09:45.418 --> 09:49.289
Munson had a strange allergic
response, so I was looking.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.958
And how do you get your hands
on 1080 poison?

09:50.991 --> 09:52.292
Agricultural companies,

09:52.325 --> 09:54.027
chemical suppliers,
nurseries.

09:54.061 --> 09:57.064
It's mostly used to protect
crops from animal pests,

09:57.097 --> 09:58.666
but it's not
regulated.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.701
All right, and how
was it delivered?

10:00.734 --> 10:02.002
Munson's reaction

10:02.035 --> 10:03.837
was localized to the
tissue in his mouth.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.773
So what? You think
maybe he drank it?

10:05.806 --> 10:07.675
Probably, but
the LAPD checked

10:07.708 --> 10:09.142
all the water bottles
in the gym.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.343
They came up clean.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.046
Okay, so, uh,
we have a generic chemical

10:13.080 --> 10:15.783
and no forensics
on delivery.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.686
Sorry there's nothing
more specific.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.954
You and the suspect
old friends?

10:20.988 --> 10:23.256
Yeah. Back during grade school,

10:23.290 --> 10:25.225
me, uh, Ben Ellis
and another kid--

10:25.258 --> 10:26.860
we were pretty tight.

10:26.894 --> 10:28.128
And now?

10:28.161 --> 10:31.198
Uh, you know, Ben and I sort of
drifted apart after high school.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.900
You know
how that is.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.735
How about the other kid?

10:34.768 --> 10:37.004
Earl's, uh... Earl's dead,

10:37.037 --> 10:39.072
so...

10:39.106 --> 10:40.040
Sorry.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.377
Thank you.

10:44.411 --> 10:45.746
Mm.

10:45.779 --> 10:49.349
Appreciate it.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.985
AMITA: It's tough
to determine linkages

10:52.019 --> 10:54.287
when these two seem to have
almost nothing in common.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.189
Yeah, the first fighter
killed, Octavio Lopez,

10:56.223 --> 10:57.925
is Hispanic;
he's from Colorado.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.961
And the other, Pete Munson,
is a white guy from Wisconsin.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.097
Fighting seems to be
the only thing in common.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.966
Well, then... then that's it.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.100
What's it?

11:07.134 --> 11:08.869
That the common link
is fighting.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.104
I mean, look at the
fighters' histories.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.405
I have to assume
that the motive

11:12.439 --> 11:13.741
in both of these deaths
involves

11:13.774 --> 11:16.009
the fighters'
rankings, right?

11:16.043 --> 11:17.978
What?

11:18.011 --> 11:19.479
David's friend,
Ben Ellis...

11:19.512 --> 11:22.215
With Lopez and Munson
out of the way,

11:22.249 --> 11:24.217
he moves to the top
of the list.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.919
-Yeah, you're right.
-(knocking)

11:25.953 --> 11:28.889
Stanley, you're a long way
from the Biochem Department.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.058
Amita, you remember
Professor Novich.

11:31.091 --> 11:31.959
Hi.

11:31.992 --> 11:35.095
I hear you're taking
Fleinhardt's seat

11:35.128 --> 11:36.463
in the Texas Hold 'Em
Tournament?

11:36.496 --> 11:38.165
I am considering it.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.933
Well, you should
think again.

11:39.967 --> 11:42.235
With Fleinhardt in space,
I'm in line for the title.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.838
I don't think that's
the way it works,

11:44.872 --> 11:46.139
(laughing):
but okay... okay.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.141
Well, I've seen your game,
Eppes.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.409
Won't make it

11:49.442 --> 11:50.878
at the big table.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.145
My game is vastly improved.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.882
Been practicing,
have you?

11:57.117 --> 11:59.086
I've been working

11:59.119 --> 12:00.420
on a specialized
training program.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.056
Should make me more than ready
by tournament time.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.196
Guess we'll just see about that.

12:11.965 --> 12:14.167
What was that?

12:14.201 --> 12:16.036
Geek trash talk?

12:16.069 --> 12:17.004
Actually,
what that was,

12:17.037 --> 12:18.171
was terribly rude,
terribly inappropriate.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.841
He has a lot of nerve coming
in here with that attitude.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.175
(chuckles):
Oh, come on, Charlie.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.310
He's trying to psych you out.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.344
Just ignore him.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.983
So Tino Alva--
he's been the AFL champion

12:30.017 --> 12:31.118
for quite a while now, right?

12:31.151 --> 12:32.252
ALSTON:
Alva's 22 and one.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.386
He hasn't
lost a fight

12:33.420 --> 12:35.956
since he took the championship
away from Bainsworth.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.024
So what's the deal?

12:37.057 --> 12:39.026
This guy Pete Munson,
he would've been up next?

12:39.059 --> 12:40.861
If he could've gotten past
Bainsworth in the qualifier.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.295
Pete was

12:42.329 --> 12:43.430
a promising fighter.

12:43.463 --> 12:46.233
If you could get past
the tattoos, he was a good kid.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.334
Charismatic.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.169
College degree.
Our sport's not

12:49.202 --> 12:50.203
as brutal
as it looks.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.172
His death was an aberration.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.173
How about Octavio Lopez?

12:53.206 --> 12:54.441
His death an aberration, too?

12:54.474 --> 12:56.376
We're gonna be looking
into his death as well.

12:56.409 --> 12:59.046
What?
Do you think they're related?

12:59.079 --> 13:00.013
They were fighting the same guy.

13:00.047 --> 13:00.914
Look,

13:00.948 --> 13:03.050
we're in the middle
of filing a petition

13:03.083 --> 13:04.217
to the State
Athletic Commission.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.086
Trying to put
our best foot forward.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.254
It would be
extremely unfortunate

13:07.287 --> 13:09.456
if it were to get out that
these deaths were connected.

13:09.489 --> 13:10.457
I understand.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.225
We're not gonna rule out
anything at this point.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.196
Agent Sinclair.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.297
Glad you joined us.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.365
I appreciate the call.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.134
Results from the Vegas
medical examiner on Lopez

13:21.168 --> 13:23.270
came back positive
for 1080 poison.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.172
Wanted you to be
here for this.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.940
Here for what?

13:26.974 --> 13:29.276
We just confirmed
the original hit.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.980
This is your friend's locker
and gym bag.

13:33.013 --> 13:36.516
These markers indicate traces
of sodium fluoroacetate.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.919
That's 1080.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.188
I just wanted you to see
for yourself who it was

13:41.221 --> 13:44.892
you helped walk out of
the station last night.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.326
Find a judge.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.295
Get a warrant
to pick up Ben Ellis.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.433
Thanks a lot.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.468
So looks like that credit
card trace paid off.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.904
Manager says he's
up in the room.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.071
You notify LAPD?

13:58.105 --> 13:59.639
They're on
their way.

13:59.672 --> 14:00.874
I don't want to wait.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.375
I'm gonna bring him
in right now.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.113
Ben! It's David.

14:06.146 --> 14:09.016
Open up. Let's go.

14:11.551 --> 14:12.953
Get your stuff, man. Let's go.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.888
Why? Where we going?

14:14.922 --> 14:15.722
Jail.

14:15.755 --> 14:16.723
But I told you,
I didn't do anything.

14:16.756 --> 14:19.059
They found traces of the poison
in your gym bag

14:19.092 --> 14:20.360
and your locker.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.461
Now, get your stuff.
]Let's go.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.095
Poison?

14:22.129 --> 14:24.998
Yeah, you're under arrest.

14:25.032 --> 14:25.832
You have the right
to remain silent.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.167
If you can't afford
an attorney...

14:30.003 --> 14:31.371
COLBY:
You all right?

14:46.987 --> 14:47.921
(elevator bell dings)

14:50.457 --> 14:52.525
Hey, I just heard from
this homicide detective.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.161
What's going on?

14:54.194 --> 14:55.228
Ellis got away.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.563
Yeah, well,
this I know.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.365
It was my fault.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.432
Well, what's
going on, David?

14:59.466 --> 15:00.367
Is it too much?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.969
It wasn't anybody's fault.

15:02.002 --> 15:02.970
And we're on it.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.271
We got pictures
at the airport.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.572
We're monitoring
his credit card.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.007
Caught him with his
credit card once.

15:07.040 --> 15:07.674
He's not gonna make
the same mistake twice.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.342
All right, so where's he go?

15:09.376 --> 15:10.944
He doesn't have any
immediate family in L.A.,

15:10.978 --> 15:12.712
but we might have some
mutual friends out here.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.713
We could pull
his phone records.

15:13.746 --> 15:14.681
Do it.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.021
CHARLIE:
You said, "Just ignore him."

15:21.054 --> 15:22.422
Right?

15:22.455 --> 15:23.957
(chuckles):
Well, obviously, I didn't think

15:23.991 --> 15:25.358
this was
gonna happen.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.328
Novich is

15:28.361 --> 15:31.531
a world-class authority on
animal defense mechanisms.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.101
This says that my office
has been contaminated

15:34.134 --> 15:36.136
with a derivative
of thioacetate.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.738
That's the stuff that gives
skunk spray its smell.

15:38.771 --> 15:42.209
Says I can't go back in until

15:42.242 --> 15:43.743
they determine
the level of toxicity.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.212
Okay, well, when will that be?

15:45.245 --> 15:47.247
Minimum of three or four days.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.982
And my laptop
is in there,

15:49.016 --> 15:51.384
which means I can't work
on my poker training program.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.552
-Hi.
-Hey, you guys.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.621
-Hey.
-What happened in here?

15:54.654 --> 15:56.056
I don't want
to talk about it.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.125
Is this the file on Ben Ellis?

15:58.158 --> 16:01.228
Yeah. What is that smell?

16:01.261 --> 16:03.196
(laughing)

16:03.230 --> 16:04.697
He got skunked.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.699
Okay, look,
is he familiar

16:06.733 --> 16:09.002
with the Los Angeles area?

16:09.036 --> 16:10.637
Well, he fights out of New York,
but he's been

16:10.670 --> 16:12.705
out here training
for about a month.

16:12.739 --> 16:13.806
So Ellis' knowledge of the area

16:13.840 --> 16:16.143
will give us a prior
distribution on his location.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.577
We can start
with his training regimen,

16:17.610 --> 16:19.612
who he works for,
who he knows.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.648
We should also
factor in the people

16:21.681 --> 16:23.283
that David knows
from the old neighborhood

16:23.316 --> 16:24.717
who might now be in L.A.

16:24.751 --> 16:25.752
Because if they were

16:25.785 --> 16:28.655
old friends,
then Ben's escape routes

16:28.688 --> 16:29.656
might go through
points in common.

16:29.689 --> 16:30.790
Yeah. That's exactly

16:30.823 --> 16:31.791
what David was thinking.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.493
-So there you go.
-Thank you.

16:33.526 --> 16:34.761
Bye.

16:34.794 --> 16:35.995
(sighs)

16:42.735 --> 16:46.239
Hey, you knew this guy
Ben Ellis pretty well?

16:46.273 --> 16:49.109
Something on your mind?

16:49.142 --> 16:51.744
You really think he's
capable of a double murder?

16:51.778 --> 16:54.647
These murders do move him
to the top of the rankings.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.450
I'm sensing you don't think
he fits the profile.

16:57.484 --> 16:58.718
I think our
killer has to be

16:58.751 --> 17:00.520
methodical.

17:00.553 --> 17:03.456
Planned out two murders
in advance.

17:03.490 --> 17:06.559
Spent two years in
a youth correctional facility.

17:06.593 --> 17:07.660
And that's just for starters.

17:07.694 --> 17:08.728
You're a psychologist.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.064
You know what those kind
of places can turn you into.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.532
What did he do

17:12.565 --> 17:14.701
to get in?

17:14.734 --> 17:18.371
Three of us went to a movie.

17:18.405 --> 17:21.341
It's me, Ben Ellis and...

17:24.211 --> 17:25.612
another kid, Earl Day.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.781
After the movies,
I decided to go home,

17:28.815 --> 17:31.818
and Ben and Earl went
to hang out with Earl's lady

17:31.851 --> 17:34.254
over at this burger spot
she worked at.

17:36.856 --> 17:38.858
Ben got into it
with some guy over there.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.827
As usual.

17:43.863 --> 17:46.799
Gun came out,
and Earl was killed.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.536
And you blame Ben?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.671
So did the State of New York.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.812
CHARLIE:
So next time, we'll get into

17:59.846 --> 18:02.282
strong type versus end-point
weak type estimates.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.117
Look, I just want
to thank you all

18:04.151 --> 18:05.452
for dealing with
the change of venue.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.819
I know it's
a little strange.

18:06.853 --> 18:07.954
Drive safely, okay?

18:07.987 --> 18:11.858
Hey, Dad, this is my graduate
harmonic analysis seminar.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.326
-Bye-bye.
-In our living room?

18:13.360 --> 18:16.229
Yeah, we usually meet
in my office, but, uh,

18:16.263 --> 18:17.597
kind of locked out
at the moment.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.598
How'd you get locked out?

18:18.631 --> 18:21.401
Oh, it's a long story.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.869
Okay.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.804
But, I can
tell it quickly.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.473
There's this professor,
who's my competition

18:26.506 --> 18:28.741
in the Texas Hold 'Em
tournament.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.411
What do you mean?
He stole your keys?

18:31.444 --> 18:32.845
No.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.847
He turned my office
into a toxic swamp.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.616
He's a biochemist.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.385
He works with skunks.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.586
What are you saying?

18:39.619 --> 18:40.487
You got skunked?

18:40.520 --> 18:43.756
He's trying to psych me out,
you know.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.725
Yeah, well, you know
they always say:

18:45.758 --> 18:47.627
the best defense
is a good offense.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.597
Yeah.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.698
Yeah, you know what?

18:51.731 --> 18:52.832
That's a great idea.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.434
I'm gonna call Amita.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.436
-(beeping)
-Hey, we have messages.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.905
(dial tone)

19:01.741 --> 19:04.811
(dialing)

19:04.844 --> 19:06.679
Yeah, Don
Eppes, please.

19:06.713 --> 19:07.614
Thought you were calling Amita.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.283
I was, but I think
I just figured out a way

19:10.317 --> 19:11.618
to help Don catch his fugitive.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.956
I have all these computers
networked for you.

19:16.989 --> 19:17.924
I have
50 phone numbers

19:17.957 --> 19:20.327
from Ben Ellis' phone records
ready to go.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.228
That's awesome.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.196
Here is the program
with the algorithm

19:23.230 --> 19:26.233
that I constructed
on Amita's laptop.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.735
Do you mind telling me
what we're doing with it?

19:28.768 --> 19:29.969
Oh, we're just gonna
find Ben Ellis

19:30.002 --> 19:31.704
by identifying
his call pattern.

19:31.738 --> 19:32.939
But he hasn't used his phone

19:32.972 --> 19:34.707
since he got away
from David and Colby.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.410
Yeah, doesn't mean he hasn't
been making any calls.

19:37.444 --> 19:38.645
Oh, like if he borrowed a phone

19:38.678 --> 19:39.846
-or used a pay phone?
-Yeah.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.749
And this algorithm will help us
identify his call pattern

19:42.782 --> 19:45.752
hidden amongst all the other
calls made on that phone.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.754
All those other calls
are like a symphony.

19:47.787 --> 19:48.755
Ben's calling pattern

19:48.788 --> 19:50.923
is like a series of notes.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.793
If we know the notes,
then we can identify his tune

19:53.826 --> 19:55.728
even if it's being played
on another instrument.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.397
But we need to do that

19:57.430 --> 19:59.532
while listening
to the entire symphony.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.534
So what do we do now?

20:01.568 --> 20:02.802
We just wait,

20:02.835 --> 20:03.670
and the program
will find

20:03.703 --> 20:04.904
the new number
calling Ben's friends.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.806
I heard you're doing

20:06.839 --> 20:08.775
a lot of work on this
poker tournament you're in.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.777
Yeah.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.479
You really want to win it, huh?

20:12.512 --> 20:14.681
The winner gets a seat
at the final table

20:14.714 --> 20:15.615
at next year's tournament.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.851
Larry had that seat
five years running.

20:18.885 --> 20:19.719
I just want to make sure

20:19.752 --> 20:21.388
it's there for him
when he gets back.

20:21.421 --> 20:22.955
(beeping)

20:22.989 --> 20:23.956
Did you get him?

20:23.990 --> 20:25.258
We got his phone.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.529
So whose house is this?

20:29.562 --> 20:32.299
Turns out, Ben has
a cousin in L.A.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.467
And he's been using
the cousin's phone?

20:34.501 --> 20:37.404
According to Charlie's
dialing pattern algorithm, yeah.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.738
Nobody's home.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.574
Ben could've taken off.
He could be anywhere.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.610
Or he could be coming
up the block right now.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.547
Suspect spotted
approaching on foot.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.981
MAN (over radio):
We have a visual.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.317
All right, move
into position.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.318
Let's take him.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.452
(tires screeching)

20:55.822 --> 20:58.691
(tires screeching)

20:58.725 --> 20:59.659
On the pavement.
Hands on the back

20:59.692 --> 21:01.294
-of your head.
-So you gonna shoot me now?

21:01.328 --> 21:02.329
Ben, I said

21:02.362 --> 21:03.963
on the pavement,
hands on the back

21:03.996 --> 21:04.664
of your head!

21:04.697 --> 21:06.833
Been a long time coming, right?

21:06.866 --> 21:08.701
You haven't changed a bit.

21:08.735 --> 21:11.904
I am not gonna ask you again.

21:11.938 --> 21:12.739
Come on, David.

21:12.772 --> 21:13.740
Come on!

21:15.107 --> 21:16.543
You want to get shot,

21:16.576 --> 21:17.777
I'm your guy.

21:17.810 --> 21:21.781
Get down on the ground, and put
your hands behind your head.

21:42.369 --> 21:46.005
Traces of the poison used
to kill both Munson and Lopez

21:46.038 --> 21:49.976
were found in your locker
and on your bag.

21:50.009 --> 21:52.612
How many times
I got to tell you this?

21:52.645 --> 21:54.080
I've never seen that bag.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.348
Really?

21:55.382 --> 21:57.817
'Cause that bag
was in your locker.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.386
Why?

21:59.419 --> 22:00.820
Why would I kill those fighters?

22:00.853 --> 22:02.522
Moves you up in the rankings.

22:02.555 --> 22:03.656
So you're gonna arrest
Kurt Bordinay,

22:03.690 --> 22:04.724
'cause it moves him up, too.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.092
Or maybe Bill Tallridge.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.960
-He was in prison.
-Yeah.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.996
But we're not talking about
either of those guys right now.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.964
Come on, David.

22:11.998 --> 22:12.899
You know me.

22:12.932 --> 22:15.402
When have I ever
backed down from a fight?

22:15.435 --> 22:17.870
Thought you'd
finally step up,

22:17.904 --> 22:19.906
take responsibility,

22:19.939 --> 22:20.940
be a man for once.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.842
A man? Yeah?

22:22.875 --> 22:23.843
(chuckles)

22:23.876 --> 22:24.844
What do you know

22:24.877 --> 22:26.913
about being
a man, David?

22:26.946 --> 22:28.915
This isn't going anywhere.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.518
That's it. Leave.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.119
It's what you do.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.153
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.822
COLBY:
Come on, man. David, easy.

22:52.972 --> 22:53.973
Hey.

22:54.006 --> 22:55.442
Hey.

22:55.475 --> 22:56.843
We don't have
any coffee.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.111
Yeah, what,
you don't even drink coffee.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.880
So, now what's going
on here?

23:00.913 --> 23:05.051
That dude has always
made me crazy.

23:05.084 --> 23:07.620
You ever know anybody like that?

23:07.654 --> 23:10.056
Well, you know Charlie, right?

23:10.089 --> 23:13.025
Look, you two were close
at some point?

23:13.059 --> 23:15.962
Once upon a time.

23:15.995 --> 23:16.996
So, I mean, is it possible?

23:17.029 --> 23:18.498
Could he have done this?

23:19.599 --> 23:21.934
I don't know.

23:21.968 --> 23:24.103
I had a case.
I put away a guy for ten years.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.472
The wrong guy.

23:25.505 --> 23:26.739
I mean a day doesn't go by,

23:26.773 --> 23:28.475
he doesn't pop into my head
at some point.

23:28.508 --> 23:30.443
So you have your doubts,
you better run 'em down.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.082
I'm all in.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.785
Okay, I'll call.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.488
I got 'em, Charlie.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.155
-Aces and Jacks.
-(sighs)

23:43.189 --> 23:44.757
Whatever.

23:44.791 --> 23:45.792
Charlie, you gotta,

23:45.825 --> 23:47.994
you gotta remember you
can't play percentages.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.597
Remember when Millie beat me
at chess?

23:50.630 --> 23:53.866
Yeah, she figured out
that you had a tell, right?

23:53.900 --> 23:55.034
Right.

23:55.067 --> 23:57.870
She played the player,
not the game.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.872
You think Novich has a tell?

23:59.906 --> 24:01.941
Everyone has a
tell, Charlie.

24:01.974 --> 24:03.075
I don't.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.944
-Yes, you do.
-Yeah, what's my tell?

24:04.977 --> 24:06.112
I'm not telling you.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.179
All right,

24:07.213 --> 24:09.516
-what do you say we knock
off this practice? -No.

24:09.549 --> 24:10.850
No, no, no.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.051
He skunked my office.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.120
I'm taking him down.

24:14.153 --> 24:15.588
Five more hands.

24:15.622 --> 24:18.057
-That's my deal.
-(sighs)

24:18.090 --> 24:21.093
So, Ben isn't
the only suspect.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.530
No, just the best one
we have at the moment.

24:23.563 --> 24:24.964
Say he is telling
the truth, all right.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.833
That would mean the traces
found on his lock

24:26.866 --> 24:28.735
on his gym bag
had to be a plant.

24:28.768 --> 24:29.936
Where are you
going with this?

24:29.969 --> 24:31.771
I'm thinking

24:31.804 --> 24:33.840
a guy's gym bag has got
to have some kind

24:33.873 --> 24:35.808
-of DNA on it, right?
-It should.

24:35.842 --> 24:36.909
Did you check the bag?

24:36.943 --> 24:38.911
I had no reason to.

24:38.945 --> 24:41.748
Can you get me a sample?

24:41.781 --> 24:42.949
From Ben.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.051
For comparison.

24:45.084 --> 24:48.655
Whoa, you're really
serious about this.

24:48.688 --> 24:51.123
Is this still
an LAPD case?

24:51.157 --> 24:52.191
Technically, it is.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.193
But we have Ben
in our lockup.

24:54.226 --> 24:55.762
(sighs)

24:55.795 --> 24:58.230
Can't be easy having
to arrest a friend.

25:00.066 --> 25:02.201
You okay?

25:02.234 --> 25:03.703
(sighs)

25:03.736 --> 25:04.971
I wasn't really ready

25:05.004 --> 25:07.073
-for old home week, you know.
-Hmm.

25:07.106 --> 25:10.309
Just when you think
you've gotten away.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.578
What's that mean?

25:11.611 --> 25:13.846
South El Paso isn't the Bronx,

25:13.880 --> 25:16.849
but I had to work pretty hard
to get out of there.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.851
I guess you don't ever
really get

25:18.885 --> 25:20.753
all that past behind you, huh?

25:20.787 --> 25:22.555
Hmm-mm.

25:22.589 --> 25:24.523
Thanks for the help.

25:30.830 --> 25:33.600
ALSTON:
Bill Tallridge will fight

25:33.633 --> 25:35.067
Ken Bainsworth
in the qualifier.

25:35.101 --> 25:38.070
And we all know who'll be
waiting for the winner...

25:38.104 --> 25:41.207
Ladies and gentlemen,
the champ, Tino Alva.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.342
(cheering and applause)

25:43.375 --> 25:46.178
So they just announced, uh,
Munson's replacement.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.346
The guy on the right,
Bill Tallridge.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.881
That's one of the guys
that Ben mentioned.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.817
Said he did a few years
in lockup, right?

25:50.850 --> 25:52.752
Yeah, three years
at Pelican Bay

25:52.785 --> 25:54.353
-for aggravated assault.
-Hey, Champ.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.855
How you doing? You worried about
either of these guys or what?

25:55.888 --> 25:58.224
No, not really.

25:58.257 --> 25:59.592
-(crowd laughs)
-To be honest,

25:59.626 --> 26:00.893
I'm just tired of waiting.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.595
I've been
in training camp now

26:02.629 --> 26:03.763
for the last six months.

26:03.796 --> 26:04.964
I'm ready to go...

26:04.997 --> 26:05.832
Whoever it is.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.299
Well, Bainsworth's been
tripping around

26:07.333 --> 26:08.968
but he said that
if he gets you in a rematch

26:09.001 --> 26:09.636
he's gonna knock you out.

26:09.669 --> 26:11.203
I think Ken needs
to worry

26:11.237 --> 26:12.338
about Bill Tallridge.

26:12.371 --> 26:13.940
Don't worry about what I need.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.942
I ain't worried about anything
here, sweet cheeks.

26:15.975 --> 26:17.009
CROWD:
Ooh.

26:17.043 --> 26:20.112
(crowd laughs)

26:20.146 --> 26:22.281
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Ken, that's it. Sit down.

26:22.314 --> 26:24.984
Hey, but Champ, not for
nothing you gotta give this,

26:25.017 --> 26:26.052
the last you fought,
he did knock you down.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.954
How 'bout I come down there
and knock you down.

26:27.987 --> 26:28.955
(laughing)

26:28.988 --> 26:30.990
Look, that fight
was almost

26:31.023 --> 26:32.859
four years ago.

26:32.892 --> 26:33.960
Ken was at his peak.

26:33.993 --> 26:34.894
He took me down.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.729
I got up and I took his belt.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.197
If Ken makes it
to the qualifier,

26:38.230 --> 26:39.365
I'll beat him again.

26:39.398 --> 26:40.867
He ain't taking this belt.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.735
(cheering and applause)

26:42.769 --> 26:44.837
(beeping)

26:46.205 --> 26:48.040
Looks like Tallridge
is gonna have to wait.

26:48.074 --> 26:50.677
If there are no more questions,
we'll see you at the fight!

26:53.012 --> 26:53.946
CHARLIE:
Hey, Megan.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.247
Hey, Charlie.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.049
Uh, Don's gone
home already.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.185
-No, actually, I came to see
you. -Me?

26:59.218 --> 27:00.720
It's about the tournament.

27:00.753 --> 27:01.353
I see.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.923
Do you know what a tell is?

27:03.956 --> 27:06.926
An unconscious gesture,
usually brought about by stress,

27:06.959 --> 27:09.161
that reveals an inner emotion,
like your brother.

27:09.195 --> 27:12.198
He always checks
his watch anytime

27:12.231 --> 27:13.432
he feels threatened.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.867
He does do that, doesn't he?

27:14.901 --> 27:16.769
Anyway, I, I need you
to tell me

27:16.803 --> 27:19.071
how I can figure out
what Stanley Novich's tell is.

27:19.105 --> 27:21.073
Well, simply speaking,

27:21.107 --> 27:23.109
it's just an
observational exercise.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.143
I have to watch Novich?

27:24.176 --> 27:25.778
Yeah, but you have
to watch him

27:25.812 --> 27:27.079
under the right
circumstances.

27:27.113 --> 27:29.816
You have to watch him
when he's under duress.

27:29.849 --> 27:30.917
And then I can see
his tell.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.952
Mm-hmm.

27:32.985 --> 27:36.088
Can you help me with some
surveillance equipment?

27:36.122 --> 27:37.156
No.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.226
Got your message.

27:40.259 --> 27:41.293
You said you had
something.

27:41.327 --> 27:42.862
From the DNA tests.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.431
I found three different
specimens on the bag.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.433
Compared them against
your friend's swab.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.903
Ben's not a match.

27:52.404 --> 27:55.041
Somebody did plant
that bag in his locker.

27:55.074 --> 27:57.009
Physical evidence says
he's telling the truth.

27:57.977 --> 28:00.412
I owe you one, Claudia.

28:00.446 --> 28:05.051
David, if Ben Ellis didn't kill
those two fighters,

28:05.084 --> 28:07.353
who did?

28:07.386 --> 28:09.321
And why would
they frame him?

28:15.394 --> 28:19.165
All right, so if Ellis
is in the clear...

28:19.198 --> 28:21.167
Oh, that'll bring us right back
to square one.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.434
Who killed these guys?

28:22.468 --> 28:25.037
Maybe somebody who, uh, opposes
to the violence of the sport.

28:25.071 --> 28:26.873
Yeah, but Charlie seemed
to think

28:26.906 --> 28:28.307
that the motives
had something to do

28:28.340 --> 28:29.475
with the rankings.

28:29.508 --> 28:30.442
Didn't Ben
say something

28:30.476 --> 28:31.844
about the
other fighters?

28:31.878 --> 28:33.412
Tallridge.

28:33.445 --> 28:35.481
Yeah, but I checked
into that; he was fighting

28:35.514 --> 28:37.516
in Japan at the time
that Lopez was killed.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.785
He's got a
good alibi.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.019
DAVID:
What if this is just

28:40.052 --> 28:41.320
about the All-Out Fighting
League itself?

28:41.353 --> 28:42.454
DON:
So, what, like

28:42.488 --> 28:43.489
an attack from a competitor?

28:43.522 --> 28:44.490
Or someone
who has a grudge

28:44.523 --> 28:46.525
-against Alston.
-Yeah, let's talk to him again.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.260
We'll take a closer look
at his business.

28:48.294 --> 28:49.195
You know, find out

28:49.228 --> 28:51.197
what his competitors
might be worried about.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.499
We think someone might be
targeting your fighters

28:53.532 --> 28:54.934
as a way of
getting at you.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.502
Me? I don't understand.

28:56.535 --> 28:58.337
These murders don't
exactly help your efforts

28:58.370 --> 28:59.906
to clean up the sport.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.340
Let me ask you this,
is there anyone

29:01.373 --> 29:03.275
who might wanna
sabotage your business?

29:03.309 --> 29:06.445
Boxing, baseball, basketball.

29:06.478 --> 29:09.048
Our ratings make us
the fastest-growing sport

29:09.081 --> 29:10.349
in the country.

29:10.382 --> 29:11.818
Yeah, what about
you personally?

29:11.851 --> 29:13.085
Any threats against you?

29:13.119 --> 29:14.553
-No.
-I'd like

29:14.586 --> 29:16.388
to take a look at a list
of your investors

29:16.422 --> 29:17.489
if that's all right.

29:17.523 --> 29:18.390
I don't see how that'll help.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.059
Mr. Alston, if you're
not the target,

29:20.092 --> 29:21.527
then quite possibly
somebody else involved

29:21.560 --> 29:23.062
in your business--

29:23.095 --> 29:24.463
they might be.

29:24.496 --> 29:25.798
You're Sinclair, right?

29:25.832 --> 29:26.866
Yeah.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.100
A detective
from LAPD came

29:28.134 --> 29:29.201
to see me yesterday.

29:29.235 --> 29:30.837
He told me about you
and Ben Ellis.

29:30.870 --> 29:33.439
I don't think
that's the issue.

29:33.472 --> 29:35.808
Oh, I think it's right on point.

29:35.842 --> 29:37.276
I understand loyalty.

29:37.309 --> 29:38.477
I do.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.246
But you're not gonna
jeopardize my business

29:40.279 --> 29:41.914
because you're unhappy
about arresting your friend.

29:41.948 --> 29:44.183
Yeah, well, I mean that's
a nice little speech,

29:44.216 --> 29:45.451
but I wanna see
those records.

29:45.484 --> 29:46.819
I'll happy to cooperate with you

29:46.853 --> 29:47.519
when you have something
specific.

29:47.553 --> 29:48.354
Well, you better cooperate now,

29:48.387 --> 29:49.822
or I'm gonna get myself
a subpoena.

29:49.856 --> 29:51.123
I'm gonna take a look at your...

29:51.157 --> 29:52.558
Fine. Fine. Fine.
I'll get you what you need.

29:52.591 --> 29:54.460
And you might

29:54.493 --> 29:56.462
wanna know that
if it weren't

29:56.495 --> 29:57.629
for the fact
that he was in custody,

29:57.663 --> 30:00.199
your friend Ellis-- he'd had
a shot against Bainsworth.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.134
He was next in line
for the qualifier.

30:02.168 --> 30:04.570
We'll be in touch.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.045
Hey.

30:15.882 --> 30:17.283
You're welcome.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.550
Excuse me?

30:18.584 --> 30:21.320
Who do you think
got you out of here?

30:23.255 --> 30:26.492
I don't even know why I bother
coming down here, man.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.627
Maybe you trying
to make some sort of amends.

30:28.660 --> 30:32.164
Make amends?

30:32.198 --> 30:34.967
Look, I was in that youth
facility for two years.

30:35.001 --> 30:36.002
Finally get something
straight, man.

30:36.035 --> 30:38.437
Locking you up back then
is one of the best things

30:38.470 --> 30:39.371
-they could have done for you.
-Look,

30:39.405 --> 30:41.573
I know you put the Bronx
in your rear-view,

30:41.607 --> 30:43.509
but I would have thought
my best friend, the guy I knew

30:43.542 --> 30:45.544
would have come to see me
at least once.

30:45.577 --> 30:47.980
-Just to find out what happened
that night. -What happened?

30:48.014 --> 30:50.516
You did the same
thing, man,

30:50.549 --> 30:52.151
I seen you do
a hundred times.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.452
I know what happened.

30:53.485 --> 30:55.287
You know that Earl
step to that guy.

30:55.321 --> 30:56.488
'Cause you know
what happened.

30:56.522 --> 31:00.126
You're saying
that E started that fight?

31:02.261 --> 31:04.396
E never started a fight
in his entire life.

31:04.430 --> 31:05.564
That guy was messing
with E's girl.

31:05.597 --> 31:06.999
E tried to back him off.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.968
That guy came back hard.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.636
I don't think E
even saw the gun coming.

31:10.669 --> 31:11.904
But I did.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.672
Why didn't you tell anybody?

31:13.705 --> 31:16.575
Lawyer said if I told my side,
claimed self-defense,

31:16.608 --> 31:18.344
I'd do 20 years.

31:20.446 --> 31:22.381
Wait. Hold on.
Wait. Hold on.

31:24.483 --> 31:25.985
I didn't know what to do.

31:26.018 --> 31:27.453
You weren't there.

31:27.486 --> 31:30.222
What's done is done.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.626
Never. Never.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.196
Say what?

31:37.229 --> 31:40.899
You asked me before, I ever seen
you back down from a fight.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.071
Answer to the question is never.

31:50.409 --> 31:54.680
What your partner said earlier
about the rankings.

31:54.713 --> 31:58.617
You oughta know, it
doesn't work that way.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.052
I mean, the rankings,
they matter, yeah,

32:00.086 --> 32:01.387
but at the end of the day,

32:01.420 --> 32:03.589
it's Larry Alston
who decides who gets to fight.

32:17.736 --> 32:20.272
Charlie.

32:20.306 --> 32:22.274
Hey, check this out.

32:22.308 --> 32:24.143
What do you got?

32:24.176 --> 32:25.244
(sniffing)

32:25.277 --> 32:26.478
What is that smell?

32:26.512 --> 32:27.679
You get used to it

32:27.713 --> 32:29.415
after a while.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.283
-I don't think so.
-No.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.085
Okay, so there he is, all right.

32:33.119 --> 32:34.420
Now this is
Professor Stanley Novich,

32:34.453 --> 32:37.323
and this is where the door
to his lab used to be.

32:37.356 --> 32:38.557
What do you mean,
"used to be"?

32:38.590 --> 32:40.492
I had one of my dad's
contractor friends bring

32:40.526 --> 32:41.727
in a crew late last night.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.029
They dry-walled
his doorway.

32:43.062 --> 32:45.031
Then painted it
to match the wall.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.698
-(laughing) -COLBY: Ah, you made
his office disappear?

32:46.732 --> 32:48.667
Yeah, well,
now watch. Oh.

32:48.700 --> 32:49.735
See that?

32:49.768 --> 32:51.003
That could be it
right there.

32:51.037 --> 32:52.271
That could be what?

32:52.304 --> 32:54.473
I'm hoping that the stress
of losing his office

32:54.506 --> 32:56.742
will force him to reveal
his poker tell.

32:56.775 --> 32:58.677
-(laughter)
-No, seriously.

32:58.710 --> 33:00.446
Well, he just did it
again.

33:00.479 --> 33:01.680
Gotcha.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.016
Now, how can I help you,
gentlemen?

33:04.050 --> 33:05.684
We actually have some new
information on the stuff

33:05.717 --> 33:07.786
you been working on about
the fighters and their rankings.

33:07.819 --> 33:10.056
AMITA:
The modified Kruskal count.

33:10.089 --> 33:11.390
Yeah. You said before
that Ben benefited

33:11.423 --> 33:12.458
from the other fighters' deaths

33:12.491 --> 33:13.592
because he improved
in the rankings.

33:13.625 --> 33:14.460
Exactly.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.795
What if rankings weren't
the only thing

33:16.828 --> 33:18.564
to determine who fought
for the title?

33:18.597 --> 33:20.332
-How do you mean?
-Ben told me

33:20.366 --> 33:22.634
that the head of the league sets
the fights, that the rankings

33:22.668 --> 33:24.503
are only a loose guide.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.338
Well, we were assuming
that the rankings alone

33:26.372 --> 33:27.539
determined
the fighting patterns.

33:27.573 --> 33:30.042
Right, I mean, if there's
an arbitrary variable involved.

33:30.076 --> 33:32.578
Yeah, it could
change things, right?

33:32.611 --> 33:33.745
Big time.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.514
Amita and I are going
to have to rework

33:35.547 --> 33:37.449
the entire
network flow analysis.

33:41.387 --> 33:42.754
What's all this?

33:42.788 --> 33:44.823
Alston sent over
the business records

33:44.856 --> 33:46.458
that you asked him for.

33:46.492 --> 33:48.527
Hey, you could have gone.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.661
You know?

33:49.695 --> 33:51.230
Not much here, really.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.465
Except that the All-Out
Fighting League is in

33:53.499 --> 33:54.533
a fair amount of debt.

33:54.566 --> 33:55.801
I thought it was a big success.

33:55.834 --> 33:59.371
It is, but Alston's focus has
been on expanding the business.

33:59.405 --> 34:00.606
What, like he's overextended?

34:00.639 --> 34:01.773
It looks like
he's using

34:01.807 --> 34:05.244
his equity in the business
as collateral on the loans.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.612
Right, so if he gets in trouble,

34:06.645 --> 34:07.779
he's going to lose everything
though, huh?

34:07.813 --> 34:09.515
We looked at almost
a hundred fighters

34:09.548 --> 34:10.616
over the past three years

34:10.649 --> 34:13.719
and mapped out idealized
fight trajectories for each.

34:13.752 --> 34:16.422
Idealized trajectories?

34:16.455 --> 34:18.557
Essentially, we used skill level
and past performance

34:18.590 --> 34:20.392
to create an objective
rating for each fighter.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.694
Then we compare our results
to the actual histories.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.630
Right, and what
we found, well,

34:24.663 --> 34:26.732
it's like driving
two different directions

34:26.765 --> 34:28.434
to the same destination.

34:28.467 --> 34:31.170
One route has all the normal
road hazards,

34:31.203 --> 34:33.139
uh, potholes, pedestrians.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.607
The other considers
road hazards in advance

34:35.641 --> 34:37.876
in order to map out
the most efficient route.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.678
So you compared
what actually happened

34:39.711 --> 34:41.413
to what should've happened.

34:41.447 --> 34:42.514
In an idealized world

34:42.548 --> 34:43.715
where fighters
only advance

34:43.749 --> 34:44.783
based on their merits.

34:44.816 --> 34:46.452
DON:
All right, so?

34:46.485 --> 34:47.319
What did you find?

34:47.353 --> 34:50.589
Over the past two years,
Ken Bainsworth

34:50.622 --> 34:52.258
has seen nothing
but green lights.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.393
There's no way that would've
happened just by chance.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.628
-Right. -So you're saying
that the fights are fixed.

34:56.662 --> 34:58.530
No. No,
the fights are very real.

34:58.564 --> 35:00.532
But someone's been manipulating
Bainsworth's schedule

35:00.566 --> 35:02.534
to make sure he doesn't lose.

35:02.568 --> 35:05.237
DON:
All right, so why?

35:05.271 --> 35:07.473
Megan said that the AFL's
pay-per-view deal

35:07.506 --> 35:09.441
for the Alva championship

35:09.475 --> 35:12.411
was going to be the
richest in MMA history.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.313
But only if Bainsworth
is the challenger.

35:14.346 --> 35:15.914
Right. So then Alston's
got no choice

35:15.947 --> 35:18.250
but to make it happen.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.252
Or the broadcast company has the
right to void the entire deal.

35:20.286 --> 35:22.688
All right, so he gets Lopez
and Munson killed...

35:22.721 --> 35:23.922
Probably 'cause they could've
beaten Bainsworth.

35:23.955 --> 35:26.658
Bill Tallridge broke his hand
in training.

35:26.692 --> 35:27.759
They just pulled him
from the qualifier.

35:27.793 --> 35:28.860
So will they cancel the fight?

35:28.894 --> 35:29.795
No way, right?

35:29.828 --> 35:31.163
Nah, the venue's booked.

35:31.197 --> 35:32.764
Tickets
are already sold.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.433
If the fighter going
into that qualifier

35:34.466 --> 35:35.901
has any chance
of beating Ken Bainsworth,

35:35.934 --> 35:37.636
then... then he's in danger.

35:37.669 --> 35:40.172
They announced the
replacement the same time

35:40.206 --> 35:41.707
they broke the news
about the injury.

35:41.740 --> 35:42.641
It's Ben.

35:44.676 --> 35:45.644
Then they'll come
after him next.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.785
I found traces
of a silicone polymer

35:53.819 --> 35:56.322
in the sodium fluoroacetate
used to kill Pete Munson.

35:56.355 --> 35:59.458
I was hoping I could use it
to pin down the manufacturer.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.859
And?

36:00.892 --> 36:03.195
I've been through
every chemical catalogue

36:03.229 --> 36:04.863
in the library.

36:04.896 --> 36:06.965
I've spoken to ten different
manufacturers.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.800
-And nothing?
-Mm-mm.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.237
I even checked
with packaging companies.

36:11.270 --> 36:13.239
Packaging?

36:13.272 --> 36:14.673
Yeah, I figured that
the silicone might have come

36:14.706 --> 36:15.941
from the container
the chemicals were in.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.409
Why would you think that?

36:17.443 --> 36:19.311
Because that
silicone compound

36:19.345 --> 36:21.547
is used to insulate
molded plastic.

36:22.648 --> 36:24.950
You mean like that?

36:24.983 --> 36:26.184
I assumed the 1080
was on the mouthpiece

36:26.218 --> 36:29.488
because the victim put it in his
mouth after he was poisoned.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.258
(speed dial beeping)

36:33.259 --> 36:35.894
David's not picking up.

36:35.927 --> 36:37.429
(crowd whistling and cheering)

36:37.463 --> 36:38.730
COLBY:
All right, guys,

36:38.764 --> 36:40.466
they tested all the water
and all the bottles,

36:40.499 --> 36:41.733
so those are
all good to go.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.902
Alston's not going to come after
me in front of all these people.

36:43.935 --> 36:45.971
COLBY: Look, his pay-per-view
deal's on the line.

36:46.004 --> 36:47.973
Without it, he goes bankrupt.

36:48.006 --> 36:49.741
Then he needs me to fight,
right?

36:49.775 --> 36:51.510
Yeah, but he needs you
to lose.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.845
OFFICIAL:
Two minutes.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.582
Let's do this.

37:02.921 --> 37:05.557
Fighting out of the blue corner,

37:05.591 --> 37:08.494
weighing in at 205 pounds,

37:08.527 --> 37:10.596
the former light heavyweight
champion,

37:10.629 --> 37:14.833
Ken "The Big Bang" Bainsworth!

37:14.866 --> 37:16.402
(crowd cheering)

37:16.435 --> 37:18.036
In the red corner,

37:18.069 --> 37:22.574
the challenger, with a record
of 11 wins, two losses,

37:22.608 --> 37:24.410
from the Bronx, New York,

37:24.443 --> 37:26.745
the pride of Jerome Avenue,

37:26.778 --> 37:29.548
Ben Ellis!

37:29.581 --> 37:31.517
(cheering)

37:44.963 --> 37:46.965
(bell dings)

38:16.528 --> 38:18.063
(cheering)

38:50.028 --> 38:53.599
(crowd cheering wildly)

38:53.632 --> 38:54.833
(bell dinging)

38:54.866 --> 38:56.402
ANNOUNCER:
Winner by submission...

38:56.435 --> 38:58.437
Ben Ellis!

38:58.470 --> 39:01.640
(cheering)

39:05.143 --> 39:07.913
Expecting a
different result?

39:07.946 --> 39:09.615
We found the mouthpiece.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.683
You're under arrest.
Turn around.

39:11.717 --> 39:14.085
Hands behind
your back.

39:14.119 --> 39:16.622
Take him away.

39:31.437 --> 39:32.471
I didn't lose.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.139
No, you didn't.

39:34.172 --> 39:35.574
Didn't die either.

39:37.843 --> 39:38.810
Thank you.

39:38.844 --> 39:41.413
Yo, back there, in front
of my cousin's house,

39:41.447 --> 39:42.648
when you picked me up...

39:42.681 --> 39:44.115
you weren't really going
to shoot me, were you?

39:44.149 --> 39:45.984
Yeah.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.424
You looked good out there, man.

39:52.458 --> 39:53.959
Thanks.

39:53.992 --> 39:56.828
So, you think
you can take Alva?

39:56.862 --> 39:59.798
Bro, we're just going to have
to see about that.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.700
About Earl...

40:01.733 --> 40:03.635
No, no.

40:03.669 --> 40:06.538
What's in the past
is in the past, right?

40:06.572 --> 40:09.107
We're cool.

40:10.175 --> 40:13.712
Yeah. Cool.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.213
I love you, bro.

40:15.246 --> 40:18.183
(crowd cheering)

40:31.630 --> 40:34.700
(applause)

40:38.103 --> 40:40.105
-Hey. -Hi.
-Charlie's still in it.

40:40.138 --> 40:41.707
-Yeah?
-It's down to the final two.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.008
Dr. Eppes,
the small blind, please.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.479
You have a large blind,
Dr. Novich.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.862
Action to you, Dr. Eppes.

41:03.895 --> 41:05.564
I'll check.

41:06.565 --> 41:08.900
(quietly):
Check.

41:12.270 --> 41:15.774
I bet 100.

41:15.807 --> 41:19.077
Raise... 200.

41:22.548 --> 41:23.715
Call.

41:23.749 --> 41:25.083
You think Charlie's
got the cards?

41:25.116 --> 41:27.185
He must have kings;
otherwise he would have folded.

41:27.218 --> 41:28.186
I mean, given the percentages.

41:31.289 --> 41:33.559
I'll bet 200.

41:33.592 --> 41:34.693
I raise...

41:34.726 --> 41:36.928
one thousand.

41:36.962 --> 41:38.764
(shocked murmuring)

41:38.797 --> 41:39.698
Wow.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.968
You have the tens, huh?

41:50.809 --> 41:51.943
I'm all in.

41:51.977 --> 41:53.945
(crowd murmuring)

41:56.047 --> 41:59.050
DEALER: If you'd like to call,
you're all in, too.

42:01.587 --> 42:04.923
I guess I'm all in, too.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.294
DEALER:
Two pair.

42:09.327 --> 42:11.196
Kings and tens.

42:11.229 --> 42:12.230
Oh, that's not good.

42:13.865 --> 42:15.033
I guess Charlie got beat.

42:19.705 --> 42:21.740
Flush. Winner.

42:21.773 --> 42:23.208
(applause)

42:27.312 --> 42:28.580
(whoops)

42:35.887 --> 42:38.156
All right, Charlie!
