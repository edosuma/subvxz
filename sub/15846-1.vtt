01:30.330 --> 01:32.129
I wonder...

01:32.168 --> 01:34.814
Do we all know where we belong?

01:34.891 --> 01:38.689
And if we do, in our hearts,

01:38.727 --> 01:42.026
why do we so often
do nothing about it?

01:42.103 --> 01:44.443
There must be more to this life--

01:44.520 --> 01:48.586
a purpose for us all,
a place to belong.

01:50.274 --> 01:53.100
You were my home.

01:53.870 --> 01:56.066
I knew from the moment I met you...

01:56.143 --> 01:59.403
that night, so many years ago.

02:01.321 --> 02:03.162
Well, come on and let me know

02:04.774 --> 02:06.768
Should I stay or should I go?

02:08.455 --> 02:11.793
Should I stay or should I go now?

02:12.829 --> 02:15.629
Should I stay or should I go now?

02:16.588 --> 02:19.504
If I go, there will be trouble

02:20.540 --> 02:23.417
And if I stay, it will be double

02:24.759 --> 02:28.442
So come on and let me know...

02:41.868 --> 02:44.553
Thanks a lot.

02:54.872 --> 02:57.330
Should I stay or should I go now?

02:57.020 --> 02:58.310
Thank you.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.124
If I go, there will be trouble

03:01.163 --> 03:02.390
Thank you.

03:02.467 --> 03:06.188
And if I stay, it will be double

03:06.226 --> 03:09.065
So, you've got to let me know

03:10.292 --> 03:13.246
Should I stay or should I go?

03:13.323 --> 03:14.857
Thank you!

03:16.852 --> 03:19.130
Thank you very much.

03:26.749 --> 03:28.168
Lovely.

03:28.245 --> 03:29.472
I want to thank the band.

03:29.549 --> 03:31.621
After that racket,
I can only appear good.

03:31.697 --> 03:33.530
Now, Margaret Thatcher...

03:33.040 --> 03:34.421
you've got to hand it to her.

03:34.459 --> 03:37.029
Love her or hate her,
Margaret Thatcher is definitely

03:37.106 --> 03:38.832
the strongest man in the Tory Party.

03:38.871 --> 03:40.482
Charley!

03:40.559 --> 03:41.671
Hi, sis.

03:41.748 --> 03:42.860
Oh, you're freezing.

03:43.270 --> 03:44.816
I know... I couldn't get a cab--
God's punishment.

03:44.855 --> 03:46.121
You don't believe in God.

03:46.197 --> 03:47.195
I know. So that's Henry, huh?

03:47.272 --> 03:48.844
Hm-mm.
- Very handsome.

03:48.883 --> 03:50.072
Hi, I'm Charlotte.

03:50.149 --> 03:51.414
How are you? Oh...

03:51.491 --> 03:52.527
Oh, it's good to meet you.

03:52.604 --> 03:53.524
Likewise.

03:53.563 --> 03:54.637
I'm so sorry I missed the wedding.

03:54.675 --> 03:55.596
No, no, no, no.

03:55.634 --> 03:56.516
I'm sure she's already told you,

03:56.593 --> 03:57.897
I'm crap at appointments
and times and stuff.

03:58.640 --> 03:58.856
Well, she did mention...

03:59.230 --> 04:00.084
Mind you, she is absolutely nuts,

04:00.160 --> 04:01.810
but you married her,
so you must know, right?

04:03.890 --> 04:04.418
We should introduce you around.

04:04.495 --> 04:06.183
Come with me.

04:06.260 --> 04:09.137
Mom, Dad, may I introduce you
to Sarah's sister, Charlotte.

04:09.213 --> 04:10.748
Yes, of course.

04:10.825 --> 04:11.707
How do you do?

04:11.784 --> 04:13.203
My parents, Mr. and Mrs. Bauford.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.083
Oh, thank goodness, you both
have the same last name.

04:15.121 --> 04:16.041
Good.

04:16.079 --> 04:17.192
Pleasure to meet you, Charlotte,

04:17.269 --> 04:18.190
or do you say Charley?

04:18.228 --> 04:19.379
Um, right now, I'd say I'm a mess,

04:19.456 --> 04:20.338
so if you don't mind...

04:20.415 --> 04:21.834
I'll take you to the bathroom.

04:22.010 --> 04:22.831
Okay.

04:23.700 --> 04:23.790
Back in a sec.

04:25.401 --> 04:27.626
Although, according to one
Ethiopian village log drummer,

04:27.665 --> 04:30.350
it translates as "I've just
eaten a sodden grape pie."

04:30.427 --> 04:31.462
Ha-ha.

04:32.690 --> 04:34.032
Oh...

04:34.109 --> 04:35.759
Sorry.

04:39.786 --> 04:41.743
Look at you.

04:41.819 --> 04:43.124
Oh, sweetie, you look beautiful.

04:43.162 --> 04:44.083
Look at you.

04:44.121 --> 04:45.617
Look at you... you're in a dress.

04:45.694 --> 04:47.036
Oh, please, a dress.

04:47.113 --> 04:49.146
I look like Ivana Trump
after a couple of rounds, baby.

04:49.223 --> 04:50.105
Whew.

04:50.182 --> 04:51.064
Come here.

04:51.141 --> 04:52.062
What?

04:53.673 --> 04:55.169
First, you've got to be kidding me.

04:55.245 --> 04:56.396
You know this is pointless.

04:56.473 --> 04:58.046
Oh, I hate this.

04:59.350 --> 05:01.115
So what do you think of him?

05:01.191 --> 05:02.726
I think he's an absolute sweetheart.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.490
He's gorgeous, really, he is.

05:04.567 --> 05:08.058
He is, and he's sweet
and he's funny and wild.

05:08.134 --> 05:09.093
He's very English.

05:09.170 --> 05:10.283
You married a very English Englishman.

05:11.357 --> 05:12.469
You're blushing!

05:14.310 --> 05:15.346
How's home?

05:15.384 --> 05:16.497
Home's good. It misses you.

05:16.535 --> 05:17.571
Work?

05:17.648 --> 05:19.029
Oh, you know, very exciting.

05:19.067 --> 05:21.138
They gave me a story
about a 10-car pile-up

05:21.292 --> 05:22.136
on 54th Street.

05:22.251 --> 05:23.172
You know, whatever.

05:23.248 --> 05:24.783
Looking up?

05:24.859 --> 05:26.777
Oh, top of the news pile, you know?

05:26.854 --> 05:28.580
You will be.

05:28.657 --> 05:30.460
Someday.

05:30.575 --> 05:31.457
But on that note,

05:31.534 --> 05:32.685
I think it's time I left the stage

05:32.762 --> 05:34.411
and brought on someone
very special indeed.

05:34.488 --> 05:36.099
Thank you very much.

05:38.707 --> 05:39.781
Hi, um...

05:39.858 --> 05:43.234
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but Mr. Bauford's son, Henry,

05:43.311 --> 05:45.500
would like to make an announcement.

05:49.010 --> 05:50.561
Thank you.

05:50.637 --> 05:51.826
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

05:52.320 --> 05:55.164
as you know, one of the reasons
we're here tonight

05:55.240 --> 05:58.194
is to show our appreciation
to Lawrence Bauford

05:58.271 --> 06:00.688
for all the great work he's done

06:00.803 --> 06:03.104
as Chairman of Aid Relief International.

06:12.733 --> 06:14.120
Sir... Sir!

06:21.320 --> 06:22.670
Sarah!

06:22.016 --> 06:23.742
Oh, darling.

06:23.780 --> 06:25.200
She's cut.
- Oh God.

06:25.276 --> 06:26.389
Are you all right?

06:32.641 --> 06:34.368
You ask me, it's a bloody rip-off.

06:34.444 --> 06:36.094
1,000 quid for an over-cooked meal

06:36.171 --> 06:37.398
and a dry hump on the dance floor,

06:37.436 --> 06:39.354
but still, we're all
getting drunk for a good cause.

06:39.431 --> 06:41.042
Right?

06:41.119 --> 06:42.423
Cheers.

06:45.450 --> 06:46.040
Get him out of here.

06:46.810 --> 06:47.400
It's a bit difficult...

06:47.026 --> 06:48.800
Well, bloody do something.

06:48.750 --> 06:51.054
20 quid a head right there.

06:51.131 --> 06:52.359
Diwy a room rental, maybe another 20.

06:52.435 --> 06:53.624
30 on catering.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.312
It's got to be 50 quid on overhead.

06:55.389 --> 06:56.425
There you go, Jojo.

06:56.501 --> 06:57.729
That's your cut.

06:57.806 --> 06:58.880
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.800
You haven't met.

07:01.066 --> 07:03.214
This is Jojo.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.536
Actually, he's curious about your dinner

07:12.574 --> 07:14.646
because when I met him,
he was so hungry

07:14.684 --> 07:16.679
he was trying to eat his own tongue.

07:16.755 --> 07:18.520
Funny enough, they don't do
Caesar salad with that.

07:18.558 --> 07:20.438
No, listen,

07:20.476 --> 07:22.126
I'll be honest, and I do want
to be honest.

07:22.203 --> 07:23.123
He was a pile of bones

07:23.200 --> 07:24.121
in a pool of shit,

07:24.197 --> 07:26.307
and I don't mean civilized shit either.

07:26.384 --> 07:27.726
This was the yellow stuff,

07:27.803 --> 07:29.299
liquid fucking evil.

07:29.376 --> 07:31.217
Anyhow, I've got 2,000 kids
in my camp in Africa

07:31.294 --> 07:32.291
with the same problem,

07:32.368 --> 07:34.478
and some fucking asshole here
has pulled our funding.

07:34.593 --> 07:36.741
So I guess I'm just going
to have to feed them flies.

07:36.818 --> 07:39.043
Now, Jojo here, he wanted to know why.

07:39.081 --> 07:40.232
So I showed him this.

07:40.385 --> 07:42.265
"Due to the repressive political climate,

07:42.342 --> 07:44.336
"we can no longer sustain a relief presence

07:44.413 --> 07:46.216
in Communist-supported Ethiopia."

07:46.293 --> 07:47.750
Is that a fair description, Larry?

07:47.827 --> 07:49.400
Or did you want a more positive spin?

07:49.477 --> 07:51.240
All right, Dr. Callahan.

07:51.011 --> 07:52.354
You've said your piece.

07:52.392 --> 07:53.504
Now you can leave.

07:53.581 --> 07:54.885
Why don't you come up here? Come on.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.080
The kid just wants to hear
in words he can understand.

07:57.850 --> 07:59.800
2,000 lives, what does that buy you?

07:59.067 --> 08:00.390
A new car?

08:00.026 --> 08:02.557
A new pair of tits for the wife?

08:02.596 --> 08:04.130
Well, come on, don't be shy.

08:04.207 --> 08:05.626
I've got a camp

08:05.703 --> 08:09.530
with 30,000 people, dying at 40 a day.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.881
I've got measles, typhoid, cholera...

08:11.480 --> 08:12.071
every miserable fucking disease

08:12.147 --> 08:13.030
known to man.

08:13.106 --> 08:14.372
Six weeks from now, they'll all be dead.

08:16.482 --> 08:17.403
Come on.

08:17.479 --> 08:19.650
Talk to me.

08:55.878 --> 08:57.719
Oh, I get it.

08:57.796 --> 09:00.481
It's the monkey joke, right?

09:00.519 --> 09:02.859
You want him to go...

09:03.260 --> 09:04.394
for you, yeah?

09:04.470 --> 09:06.503
Oh, he'll do that.

09:08.690 --> 09:10.339
He'll do that for you.

09:10.416 --> 09:11.759
Jojo...

09:30.900 --> 09:33.279
300 calories in one banana--

09:33.355 --> 09:34.430
more than he gets in a day.

09:37.422 --> 09:38.803
He'll do whatever you want.

09:41.143 --> 09:42.523
Jojo!

10:30.857 --> 10:33.389
All right, you want to get down
out of the van now, please?

10:40.332 --> 10:41.291
Sir?

10:41.368 --> 10:43.132
Excuse me, sir.

10:43.209 --> 10:45.127
Can you get down
from the vehicle now, please?

10:47.352 --> 10:49.001
Come on. In you go.

11:28.397 --> 11:30.008
Dr. Callahan, I presume?

11:30.085 --> 11:32.425
I was there tonight.

11:32.463 --> 11:34.765
I was compelled.

11:42.322 --> 11:43.434
EGRIS.

11:43.473 --> 11:46.426
Sounds pretentious enough to be a charity.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.035
No, wait a minute, I remember.

11:49.111 --> 11:50.531
I was in India when

11:50.608 --> 11:52.449
you lot were working the
borders with Afghanistan.

11:52.526 --> 11:54.405
Rumors were, you got in.

11:54.482 --> 11:56.822
There's a lot of people
still dying over there.

11:56.899 --> 11:58.893
They always do, Doctor.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.003
Yeah, well, I'm no warrior.

12:01.041 --> 12:02.499
I'm in the relief business.

12:02.614 --> 12:04.302
So I gathered.

12:04.379 --> 12:06.143
So, here we are--

12:06.220 --> 12:09.711
you with your relief work,
me with my relief work.

12:09.749 --> 12:13.317
And isn't it a strange coincidence,

12:13.393 --> 12:14.851
because I need to get into Ethiopia,

12:15.180 --> 12:15.810
and you're already there.

12:15.887 --> 12:17.421
No thanks.

12:17.498 --> 12:18.649
I'd fund your work

12:18.725 --> 12:20.413
of course.

12:20.490 --> 12:21.564
No.

12:21.641 --> 12:25.822
"I've got a camp with 30,000
people, dying at 40 a day.

12:25.899 --> 12:28.584
In 6 weeks time, they'll all be dead."

12:30.348 --> 12:32.110
Slight exaggeration perhaps,

12:32.880 --> 12:33.494
but very effective.

12:33.571 --> 12:35.220
Since when did the CIA give a shit

12:35.297 --> 12:37.483
about the starving in Africa?

12:37.560 --> 12:40.399
I presume you are CIA, Mr. Steiger.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.240
Idle curiosity...

12:42.317 --> 12:44.849
Your performance tonight,

12:44.887 --> 12:47.035
was it a cry for help,

12:47.112 --> 12:48.186
or a cry for attention?

12:48.263 --> 12:50.400
I'd call it a press conference.

12:50.027 --> 12:53.595
No, a declaration of independence.

12:53.671 --> 12:56.433
Freedom is an expensive commodity.

12:56.510 --> 12:58.390
You should see what I paid for your bail.

12:58.466 --> 13:01.036
No deal.

13:01.075 --> 13:02.648
Passion is cheap, Doctor.

13:02.724 --> 13:04.566
If you're looking for a dancing bear,

13:04.604 --> 13:06.484
try the fucking circus.

13:22.710 --> 13:24.244
Hmm. Cigarettes at dawn.

13:24.321 --> 13:27.351
Either you're deliriously happy,
or you haven't slept.

13:28.732 --> 13:30.535
Do you need me to call you a cab?

13:30.612 --> 13:32.146
No, I already called one.

13:33.758 --> 13:35.215
How's your hand?

13:35.292 --> 13:36.213
Oh, it's fine.

13:38.399 --> 13:39.857
So, Henry, is he, uh...?

13:40.240 --> 13:42.120
Oh, he's-he's still sleeping.

13:42.197 --> 13:43.117
Oh.

13:44.652 --> 13:47.184
So...

13:47.260 --> 13:49.380
I'm going to miss you.

13:49.760 --> 13:50.713
Yeah, me, too.

13:50.751 --> 13:51.672
But, you know, listen,

13:51.710 --> 13:53.660
if it gets too English over here,

13:53.053 --> 13:54.434
you give me a call, and l'll send you

13:54.510 --> 13:56.774
a nice American care package
full of macaroni and cheese

13:56.850 --> 13:59.459
and apple pie, and a pair of sneakers.

13:59.535 --> 14:02.604
That'll go over well here in
fashionable London, I'm sure.

14:04.330 --> 14:05.328
Hello?

14:05.405 --> 14:08.665
Cab for Ms. Jordan.
- Okay, thank you.

14:08.742 --> 14:10.046
Well, it's here.

14:10.123 --> 14:11.159
Tell Mr. Sleepy Pants,

14:11.235 --> 14:13.575
that I said good-bye, pip-pip, cheerio,

14:13.652 --> 14:15.301
or whatever the hell they do here.

14:15.378 --> 14:16.260
I love you.

14:16.337 --> 14:17.526
I love you, too.

14:17.603 --> 14:18.715
Bye, sis.

14:18.792 --> 14:20.633
Take care.
- You, too.

14:20.710 --> 14:22.436
...the boy escaped while being transferred

14:22.513 --> 14:25.889
to the immigration
facility at Heathrow Airport.

14:26.042 --> 14:27.615
His body was found early this morning

14:27.692 --> 14:29.571
here under Junction 5.

14:29.648 --> 14:31.796
Initial reports suggest
he died of hypothermia.

14:31.873 --> 14:34.673
A spokesman for the Immigration Department

14:34.750 --> 14:37.397
blamed the security lapse
on staff shortages.

14:37.512 --> 14:40.005
We are told that the boy
was arrested the previous night

14:40.082 --> 14:43.490
in a disturbance at a charity
ball in a London hotel.

14:43.036 --> 14:45.759
A man identified as Nicholas Callahan,

14:45.836 --> 14:47.601
a relief worker in Ethiopia,

14:47.677 --> 14:50.690
interrupted the event
with an emotional plea

14:50.056 --> 14:51.552
for more help in Africa.

14:51.628 --> 14:54.697
At Junction 5, Aidan Pickering, LNS.

14:54.851 --> 14:56.423
When Dubuque started,

14:56.500 --> 14:58.341
you could see how much
she owed to Van Gogh.

14:58.418 --> 15:00.605
She didn't hide it;
it's in all her landscapes,

15:00.681 --> 15:04.057
But if you look here, what she's
doing in this abstract

15:04.134 --> 15:07.087
is something much more
calculated, more developed.

15:07.164 --> 15:10.693
The way she takes the-the theme
of attraction and repulsion,

15:10.770 --> 15:13.148
dark against light.

15:13.225 --> 15:17.406
Over here, another piece, which I think

15:17.445 --> 15:18.787
has even more emotional depth.

15:18.864 --> 15:19.785
It's beautiful, isn't it?

15:20.897 --> 15:23.390
Now, we do have...
other examples of her work,

15:23.467 --> 15:25.155
which I think you should see.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.070
Sweetheart, are you sure you
know what you're doing?

15:28.147 --> 15:29.375
Yes, I do.

15:29.413 --> 15:31.369
And before you say anything, I've spoken

15:31.446 --> 15:33.824
to all the relevant relief
organizations and embassies,

15:33.863 --> 15:35.270
and with 40,000 pounds...

15:35.650 --> 15:35.896
40,000 pounds?

15:36.630 --> 15:37.085
What are you talking about?

15:37.123 --> 15:38.466
Where are you going to find 40,000...?

15:38.504 --> 15:40.461
...and supplies from surplus
regions in Southern Sudan.

15:40.537 --> 15:43.223
And from there, I transport them to Tigre.

15:43.299 --> 15:44.412
I've cleared out my savings,

15:44.450 --> 15:46.740
I'm still short about 8,000.

15:46.061 --> 15:47.634
But, Sarah, this isn't how it's done.

15:47.711 --> 15:48.593
You don't go...

15:48.670 --> 15:50.166
Henry, Henry. I've made up my mind.

15:50.242 --> 15:52.736
Well, then send the money,
do charitable work, whatever,

15:52.813 --> 15:53.733
but don't go roaring off

15:53.810 --> 15:55.114
to some godforsaken hole in Africa

15:55.229 --> 15:56.380
just to salve your conscience.

15:56.457 --> 15:57.377
It's just too...

15:57.416 --> 15:58.643
Too what?

15:58.720 --> 16:00.715
Well, it's not the most
grown-up way to deal with

16:00.791 --> 16:01.520
this situation.

16:01.597 --> 16:02.594
Well, maybe I don't want to grow up.

16:09.499 --> 16:11.647
Fine...

16:11.724 --> 16:14.770
Fine.

16:14.064 --> 16:15.750
If that's what you want,

16:15.061 --> 16:16.672
It is.
- Then fine.

16:16.749 --> 16:18.706
Then...

16:18.782 --> 16:20.010
I'll help you find the money.

16:21.467 --> 16:23.040
Thank you.

16:23.117 --> 16:24.536
I'll talk to Dad.

16:24.613 --> 16:26.608
He knows everybody.

16:26.684 --> 16:28.794
Mind you, Ethiopia is a bit...

16:28.871 --> 16:30.137
It'll be fine.

16:30.214 --> 16:33.551
It'll be fine. We'll find the money.

16:34.625 --> 16:36.351
Come with me.

16:36.428 --> 16:37.886
Honey, even if I could...

16:38.520 --> 16:39.500
You can't?

16:39.036 --> 16:40.110
No, it's not that.

16:40.187 --> 16:42.067
You know me, I'm not made
for that kind of thing.

16:42.144 --> 16:44.752
I'm a city boy. I need 4 walls and a bed.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.401
Besides, I've got meetings up to here

16:46.478 --> 16:47.476
for the next month.

16:53.383 --> 16:55.339
You should go.

16:55.416 --> 16:57.833
You've got the right attitude.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.863
Listen, I know this sounds
like Little Miss Bleeding Heart

17:01.300 --> 17:04.162
and all that... I just, I don't care.

17:04.239 --> 17:07.140
I know I'm being crazy
and driving you crazy,

17:07.001 --> 17:09.186
and of course I understand
you can't come, but...

17:09.263 --> 17:10.798
you meet me off the plane?

17:12.410 --> 17:13.637
You meet me off the plane?

17:13.714 --> 17:16.551
Of course l'll meet you off the plane.

18:14.284 --> 18:16.778
Three years and no rain, not a drop.

18:16.854 --> 18:18.159
That, and war.

18:18.235 --> 18:23.050
People leave their homes,
they walk for many days.

18:23.820 --> 18:24.411
We only have 10 camps on the south side.

18:24.488 --> 18:27.518
Too many people, not enough camps.

18:35.727 --> 18:37.032
Measles, you know measles?

18:37.108 --> 18:38.144
Yes, of course.

18:38.259 --> 18:41.520
We lose more people
to measles and diarrhea.

18:41.597 --> 18:43.131
Many die, no vaccine.

18:43.208 --> 18:45.816
We brought some vaccines...
- Also cholera, everywhere.

18:46.210 --> 18:48.041
We dig very deep now for good water.

18:48.118 --> 18:52.299
Starvation everywhere, death is everywhere.

18:57.363 --> 18:59.626
You speak English very well.

18:59.702 --> 19:01.352
Missionaries teach me.

19:01.429 --> 19:03.730
Yeah?

19:03.807 --> 19:05.090
So are you married?

19:05.860 --> 19:06.799
Do you have a husband?
- Man? Bullshit.

19:06.876 --> 19:07.873
I need no man.

19:08.027 --> 19:10.060
They beg to marry me, many times,

19:10.136 --> 19:11.632
but I drive truck.

19:11.709 --> 19:13.650
Lazy man, good-for-nothing.

19:13.052 --> 19:16.570
I'm too old now anyway.

19:16.044 --> 19:18.115
No man in my village want woman over 18.

19:18.192 --> 19:20.187
In my tribe, it's 30.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.401
Stop.

19:26.478 --> 19:29.610
Stop the truck. Stop. Stop!

19:55.670 --> 19:57.434
Abraha!

19:57.511 --> 19:59.659
Abraha!

20:02.344 --> 20:05.375
Abraha...

20:10.680 --> 20:12.395
Is this your son?

20:12.471 --> 20:14.811
This your son?

20:14.888 --> 20:17.420
Abraha...

20:17.497 --> 20:18.571
Abraha?

20:18.609 --> 20:21.371
Ab-Ab...

20:23.059 --> 20:24.171
No baby.

20:24.210 --> 20:26.665
We go. Too dangerous to stop.

20:28.391 --> 20:29.542
We go now.

20:38.671 --> 20:41.088
Is a waste.

20:41.165 --> 20:45.499
Child and mother, both a waste.

20:45.576 --> 20:47.470
Stupid baby woman.

23:19.745 --> 23:20.857
Tula, shut up.

23:27.225 --> 23:28.721
I'll give you 4 bags.

23:28.798 --> 23:31.099
4 bags not enough.

23:31.138 --> 23:33.056
I take 1 truck.

23:33.094 --> 23:35.473
You want to tell them that
you're taking half their food?

23:35.626 --> 23:37.580
How many are you? 50? A hundred?

23:37.045 --> 23:38.004
My men fight...

23:38.081 --> 23:39.577
I know, I know-- for the people.

23:39.654 --> 23:40.536
Mm.

23:55.765 --> 23:57.606
It's good.

24:14.791 --> 24:16.211
No. No, no, no, no.

24:18.896 --> 24:20.124
8 bags.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.041
4 each truck.

24:22.118 --> 24:23.653
This is fair.

24:23.729 --> 24:25.225
Hmm, Mr. Elliott?

24:25.302 --> 24:27.259
Fair, yes?

24:35.314 --> 24:37.270
Welcome to famine relief.

25:04.238 --> 25:05.542
Okay, kill it!

25:18.316 --> 25:20.042
Hold his legs, okay?

25:45.014 --> 25:46.242
Excuse me.

25:46.280 --> 25:47.508
Excuse me.

25:47.584 --> 25:49.426
This child, his mother's in the truck.

25:49.502 --> 25:50.615
She's wounded.

26:08.644 --> 26:09.756
Too late.
- What?

26:09.833 --> 26:12.096
Too late, as in no point.

26:12.135 --> 26:13.055
Why?

26:13.132 --> 26:14.206
Why?

26:14.283 --> 26:17.006
Well, quite apart from
any illnesses they may have,

26:17.083 --> 26:18.503
they're too weak to survive.

26:18.618 --> 26:20.804
You, just...

26:20.881 --> 26:22.450
You just decide that?

26:22.032 --> 26:23.528
It's called triage. I'm a doctor.

26:23.604 --> 26:24.832
I've got 30,000...
- I know.

26:24.870 --> 26:26.328
I heard that already in London.

26:27.862 --> 26:29.260
You did?

26:29.013 --> 26:30.586
Yes. I still think you should help them.

26:30.663 --> 26:31.660
Oh, you do, do you?

26:31.737 --> 26:32.657
Yes, I do.

26:32.734 --> 26:34.115
I see. You pay for these trucks,

26:34.153 --> 26:36.455
so I have to indulge
some fucking white girl's idea

26:36.493 --> 26:37.414
of heroism, right?

26:37.452 --> 26:39.770
Well, why stop there?
Do you want a picture?

26:39.025 --> 26:40.022
I can get you a picture

26:40.099 --> 26:42.324
of "poor little rich girl
holds dying black baby."

26:42.401 --> 26:44.280
You do your hair right, you'll look great.

26:44.357 --> 26:46.580
I saw the child from the truck.

26:46.045 --> 26:48.270
I picked him up,
his mother was wounded.

26:48.308 --> 26:50.188
I brought her, too.

26:50.226 --> 26:51.607
Can you please look at them?

26:58.819 --> 27:00.210
Seems fair.

27:06.644 --> 27:07.757
Kat.

27:10.864 --> 27:11.746
Hi.

27:11.823 --> 27:13.626
Hi. I'm Kat.

27:17.150 --> 27:19.188
Okay, so... I'm the chief administrator

27:19.265 --> 27:23.561
and logistician, if that
doesn't sound too pompous,

27:23.638 --> 27:25.300
and you've met Nick,

27:25.320 --> 27:27.742
who's our team leader and full-time doctor.

27:27.819 --> 27:29.660
He's got a lot on his hands right now.

27:36.603 --> 27:40.690
So this is the food-distribution center.

27:40.056 --> 27:41.514
Low-tech but effective,

27:41.590 --> 27:43.853
like the rest of us.

27:44.200 --> 27:46.309
The food supplies I brought,
how long will they last?

27:46.385 --> 27:49.109
Oh, 3 or 4 days, maybe.

27:49.186 --> 27:50.336
That's it?

27:50.413 --> 27:53.405
I'm afraid so, yeah.

27:53.482 --> 27:54.863
What are you going to do
when the food runs out?

27:55.300 --> 27:57.240
Well, we usually find a way.

27:57.630 --> 27:59.351
Same old story really, you know--

27:59.428 --> 28:02.110
money, or the lack of it,

28:02.880 --> 28:04.261
but with help, we get by.

28:38.286 --> 28:40.013
Um, I don't think you want to go...

28:40.089 --> 28:42.046
Is it all right?

28:42.122 --> 28:44.501
Sure. Yeah.

28:48.183 --> 28:51.712
Well, if it isn't Mrs. Bauford.

28:51.789 --> 28:56.124
Sorry about the mess.

28:57.275 --> 28:58.886
You won't see this in medical school.

29:03.566 --> 29:05.370
Cut.

29:10.620 --> 29:11.084
If you're going to throw up,

29:11.161 --> 29:12.120
close your eyes.

29:12.197 --> 29:13.079
Think of ponies

29:13.156 --> 29:15.342
and ice cream.

29:15.380 --> 29:16.646
Is that... perfume?

29:19.255 --> 29:22.669
You're wearing perfume in the
middle of the fucking desert.

29:22.746 --> 29:24.242
Ha-ha.

29:27.157 --> 29:28.615
The boy, has he been looked at?

29:28.691 --> 29:30.226
Yes, ma'am. Checking him now.

29:30.303 --> 29:31.607
One shed over.

29:31.683 --> 29:33.010
As you instructed.

29:38.780 --> 29:40.391
What does it mean?
- Sew it up.

29:40.468 --> 29:42.160
Monica, get her a Fanta.

29:54.239 --> 29:56.119
It's weird isn't it?

29:56.157 --> 29:57.346
All those plans you have,

29:57.423 --> 29:58.612
places to go, people to meet.

29:58.650 --> 30:00.568
All that matters
in her whole world is that.

30:00.607 --> 30:03.676
Just one suck of soda,
that's all she lives for.

30:03.752 --> 30:05.747
She's in pain--
can't you give her something?

30:05.824 --> 30:06.706
Oh, yeah, sure.

30:06.783 --> 30:08.125
Monica, call down to the pharmacy

30:08.164 --> 30:09.430
for more morphine, could you?

30:09.468 --> 30:11.348
Where do you think you are, Saint Elsewhere?

30:11.386 --> 30:12.575
She's in pain.

30:12.690 --> 30:13.534
She's beyond pain.

30:13.649 --> 30:14.455
Have you asked her that?

30:16.450 --> 30:18.751
Hamadi.

30:18.828 --> 30:20.056
Ask her if it hurts.

30:40.156 --> 30:42.110
She, uh...

30:42.870 --> 30:45.603
says she feels the pain of hunger, but

30:45.680 --> 30:47.214
she knows that death more hungry than pain,

30:47.291 --> 30:49.132
so, she gives thanks.

30:49.209 --> 30:51.357
She gives thanks to you.

30:51.434 --> 30:53.736
She calls you by a new name.

30:53.812 --> 30:55.884
Matanay.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.450
"He who steals from Death."

31:34.359 --> 31:36.545
He's got a fever, and he's in shock.

31:38.502 --> 31:40.573
Increase the fluids. Antibiotics.

31:46.596 --> 31:49.396
You really think he's going
to sit up and take a drink?

31:49.473 --> 31:50.355
I was just...

31:50.432 --> 31:51.314
He's dying.

31:51.391 --> 31:52.426
You'd better move his lips,

31:52.503 --> 31:53.462
or he won't take a cup.

31:53.539 --> 31:54.574
I was just trying to help.

31:54.651 --> 31:55.533
To help, you have

31:55.610 --> 31:56.569
to know what you're doing.

31:56.646 --> 31:58.400
Look, I know you think I'm stupid,

31:58.027 --> 31:59.101
and you want me to go home.

31:59.178 --> 32:00.635
You don't have to waste any more time

32:00.712 --> 32:02.362
trying to make that clear to me.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.470
Get some H.E.M.

32:10.034 --> 32:11.184
High Energy Milk.

32:11.261 --> 32:13.102
Monica will give it to you.

32:13.179 --> 32:15.327
You tease around his mouth with your finger.

32:15.404 --> 32:17.590
You let him suck it out, small amounts only.

32:17.667 --> 32:19.125
If he revives, call the nurse.

32:19.202 --> 32:21.273
If he doesn't...

32:21.311 --> 32:24.380
at least he'll have someone
with him when he dies.

33:13.864 --> 33:14.785
How many?

33:14.823 --> 33:17.586
Kat?

33:17.662 --> 33:19.580
11 from last night.

33:19.657 --> 33:21.805
12.

33:21.882 --> 33:23.071
The 10-year-old.

33:23.148 --> 33:25.790
That makes 39.

33:25.066 --> 33:26.217
So there's more than yesterday.

33:26.293 --> 33:27.176
I know.

33:27.252 --> 33:28.442
Right, and you'd better hire

33:28.518 --> 33:31.250
extra men from the camp
and get them digging more holes.

33:31.012 --> 33:32.891
Put them on night shift
so nobody sees them.

33:33.580 --> 33:34.771
Can't have people dying
of depression, eh?

33:39.566 --> 33:40.870
How's the water coming, Joss?

33:42.289 --> 33:43.172
Nothing so far.

33:43.248 --> 33:44.821
Drive shaft is close to buggering,

33:44.898 --> 33:47.238
and we're down to 2 liters
per person per day.

33:47.276 --> 33:49.540
What about the tankers?

33:49.041 --> 33:50.767
Yeah, sure. That's piss in a bucket, mate.

33:50.844 --> 33:52.455
Basically, if we don't get the new well

33:52.531 --> 33:54.104
up and running, we're knackered.

33:54.181 --> 33:55.677
Okay, so what do you need exactly?

33:55.715 --> 33:56.636
I just told you.

33:56.713 --> 33:58.209
A new drive shaft.

33:58.285 --> 34:00.894
Okay, I'm going to see what I can do.

34:08.413 --> 34:10.292
Well, the good news, boys and girls,

34:10.369 --> 34:13.130
is that the government's
finally coming tomorrow.

34:13.206 --> 34:14.473
I got confirmation today

34:14.512 --> 34:16.467
that Mr. Ningpopo himself will be here.

34:16.545 --> 34:18.271
For about an hour.

34:18.348 --> 34:19.422
That long?

34:19.498 --> 34:20.380
Well, you never know.

34:20.458 --> 34:21.417
We might get lucky.
- Right.

34:21.493 --> 34:22.491
Here's what we're going to do.

34:22.567 --> 34:23.833
First thing in the morning, we're going

34:24.000 --> 34:24.792
to break open the new supplies,

34:24.869 --> 34:25.790
start immunizing all the children

34:25.866 --> 34:26.748
against measles, youngest first,

34:26.824 --> 34:28.283
up the line, until we run out.

34:28.360 --> 34:29.741
Okay? Kat, Monica: I want you

34:29.779 --> 34:31.237
to get onto that as early as possible.

34:31.313 --> 34:32.272
All right.

34:32.349 --> 34:34.574
I'll set up the call chain
and check the syringes.

34:34.650 --> 34:36.223
No, I'm going to need you
with me, and you, Tula.

34:36.300 --> 34:37.413
Joss.
- Yeah.

34:37.451 --> 34:38.755
Sanitation.

34:38.831 --> 34:40.520
I think you need to take your team

34:40.597 --> 34:42.860
and cut a new defecation area
somewhere beyond the camp.

34:43.270 --> 34:43.819
Yeah, and let's just

34:43.896 --> 34:44.777
chlorinate all the water, okay?

34:44.855 --> 34:45.775
All of it.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.310
Yeah, the tankard water is absolutely fine.

34:47.386 --> 34:49.228
Fuck the tanker water.
Just chlorinate the lot.

34:49.304 --> 34:50.762
There's too much infection
to risk leaving it, okay?

34:50.839 --> 34:51.873
Okay.

34:52.409 --> 34:54.023
Okay.

34:54.099 --> 34:55.135
Good.

34:55.212 --> 34:57.014
All right, make sure
you get me your requests

34:57.091 --> 34:59.009
for Ningpopo as soon as possible.

34:59.086 --> 35:01.503
Two hookers and a single to Melbourne.

35:01.579 --> 35:03.120
Business or coach?

35:07.564 --> 35:09.500
Good night, Sarah.

35:09.340 --> 35:09.865
Good night.

35:15.543 --> 35:17.537
Oh, I forgot.

35:17.614 --> 35:20.414
The boy's mother.

35:20.491 --> 35:21.718
She died.

35:35.144 --> 35:37.830
We've got about 10 days left.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.591
Maybe 2 weeks, if we're lucky.

35:42.395 --> 35:43.852
What happened with USAID?

35:43.891 --> 35:45.195
Nothing.

35:45.272 --> 35:46.499
CARE?

35:46.576 --> 35:49.060
CARE, USAID, the OXFAM, WFB...

35:49.820 --> 35:50.105
they don't want to know.

35:50.181 --> 35:51.064
Everyone I spoke to

35:51.140 --> 35:53.720
in Addis had an acute case

35:53.058 --> 35:54.310
of compassion fatigue.

35:54.017 --> 35:54.900
How 'bout the old man?

35:55.660 --> 35:56.243
The trust fund?

35:56.281 --> 35:59.580
My father was the politest
"fuck you" I ever got.

36:03.840 --> 36:04.068
What about Steiger?

36:04.145 --> 36:05.871
Some small favors,

36:06.380 --> 36:07.290
a little info on...

36:07.367 --> 36:08.364
Yeah, stash a shitload of weapons...

36:08.479 --> 36:10.244
So what if he's fucking over the Marxists...

36:10.320 --> 36:11.663
I'm not getting into business
with those people.

36:11.740 --> 36:13.888
Listen, Elliott, if it's
all we got, I don't see why...

36:14.550 --> 36:16.036
There is no way...
- Why not for, Christ's sake?

36:16.113 --> 36:18.683
Because that's not how we started!

36:18.760 --> 36:22.787
And because I wouldn't
have it any other way.

36:27.391 --> 36:30.728
What the hell is that?

36:30.805 --> 36:34.718
Schumann, I think.

37:22.783 --> 37:24.586
Hi.

37:35.058 --> 37:37.551
"I dream of childhood.

37:37.666 --> 37:41.042
"I dream of love.

37:41.119 --> 37:43.766
"Of a garden where a boy plays,

37:43.804 --> 37:46.040
forever young."

37:46.800 --> 37:49.021
"Themes from Childhood."

37:49.098 --> 37:53.279
Part of a series
from Schumann's "Lederhosen."

37:53.356 --> 37:55.810
Lederhosen are trousers.

37:57.230 --> 37:58.227
Ah.

37:58.304 --> 38:01.833
The German for song is lieder.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.406
Lieder.

38:03.483 --> 38:05.746
Yes, correct.

38:16.026 --> 38:18.136
Is there something you wanted?

38:20.668 --> 38:22.432
The baby.

38:22.509 --> 38:24.580
You tried the H.E.M.?

38:24.734 --> 38:26.038
Yes.

38:26.115 --> 38:27.726
And?

38:27.803 --> 38:30.603
And no change.

38:31.754 --> 38:33.864
Sometimes it takes a while.

40:07.462 --> 40:09.687
Hey, woman, come, come.

40:48.239 --> 40:49.658
Yes.

40:51.384 --> 40:53.609
One life.

40:58.340 --> 40:59.248
Ningpopo's here.

41:10.219 --> 41:12.482
Look right now
we're at 800 calories a day.

41:12.521 --> 41:14.784
In a few days it will be down to 500.

41:14.822 --> 41:16.702
The bottom line is,

41:16.740 --> 41:18.850
we're not going to make
next week's distribution.

41:18.888 --> 41:20.077
Not a chance.

41:20.193 --> 41:21.880
And that raises the issue of security.

41:22.470 --> 41:23.683
If I can't get these people more food,

41:23.722 --> 41:25.601
I can't guarantee the safety of my staff.

41:25.678 --> 41:26.752
Food, security.

41:26.829 --> 41:28.478
I believe these are listed
as separate issues.

41:28.555 --> 41:32.123
Yes, but I'm sure you'd
agree they're connected.

41:50.037 --> 41:52.223
Well, if we could get some emergency corn,

41:52.300 --> 41:53.221
that'd be a start.

41:53.259 --> 41:56.059
I will raise it with the WFB.

41:56.136 --> 41:57.018
Thank you.

41:57.095 --> 41:58.284
They owe us since August anyway.

41:58.361 --> 41:59.435
Excuse me?
- Any emergency corn

41:59.550 --> 42:00.662
would be greatly appreciated.

42:00.739 --> 42:01.775
I'm sorry, excuse me, who owes you?

42:01.852 --> 42:03.079
The WFB. 3 months of corn.

42:03.118 --> 42:04.077
It'll be in your notes.

42:04.153 --> 42:06.109
There's no reference to the WFB in my notes.

42:06.186 --> 42:07.820
Then your notes are wrong.

42:07.068 --> 42:08.450
Okay, we can move on...

42:08.488 --> 42:10.740
to the issue of security.

42:10.061 --> 42:12.324
Our soldiers have no experience
of this order, Mr. Hauser.

42:12.362 --> 42:14.741
Please, we have another meeting
at Kromer Camp at 4:00 p.m.

42:14.817 --> 42:16.505
If we can deal with
these matters separately

42:16.582 --> 42:17.503
and in the proper order.

42:17.579 --> 42:20.480
It is no good to jump from food to security.

42:20.034 --> 42:21.070
This is not coherent.

42:21.830 --> 42:22.029
Not coherent?

42:22.106 --> 42:23.717
Listen, they don't get
enough food, they get hungry.

42:23.755 --> 42:25.730
If they get hungry, they get desperate,

42:25.059 --> 42:26.320
they wreck the camp.

42:26.018 --> 42:27.054
That is a security issue.

42:27.131 --> 42:28.167
Please do not raise your voice.

42:28.243 --> 42:30.622
For Christ's sake, they're
all fucking dying out there.

42:30.698 --> 42:32.271
Will you please stop talking bollocks

42:32.348 --> 42:34.151
and start getting some food delivered now.

42:34.189 --> 42:36.184
No excuses, no money changing hands,

42:36.261 --> 42:37.373
just do it.

42:37.450 --> 42:39.329
I find this innuendo most
disturbing, Dr. Callahan.

42:39.368 --> 42:41.324
I can assure you, not
a single dollar changes hands

42:41.401 --> 42:42.897
without authorization.

42:43.640 --> 42:44.623
Procedures of the utmost importance...

42:44.700 --> 42:45.774
Procedures, my fucking ass.

42:45.851 --> 42:47.385
You've got friends
in the water-trucking business

42:47.500 --> 42:48.344
whose sole aim in life

42:48.459 --> 42:50.185
is to hike up the price
by restricting delivery.

42:50.223 --> 42:51.144
You seriously telling me

42:51.182 --> 42:52.640
those shitheads are following procedure?

42:52.717 --> 42:53.638
I find this outrageous,

42:53.676 --> 42:54.597
especially coming from you.

42:54.635 --> 42:55.786
What do you mean especially coming from me?

42:55.863 --> 42:57.473
To take a refugee boy from the camp

42:57.512 --> 42:58.586
without authorization

42:58.663 --> 43:01.386
to die like an animal
in a country he does not know?

43:01.425 --> 43:02.499
The death of a child

43:02.576 --> 43:04.570
is not a minor violation, Dr. Callahan.

43:04.647 --> 43:05.721
I can assure you,

43:05.798 --> 43:08.713
you are under serious investigation.

43:23.673 --> 43:24.556
What?

43:28.047 --> 43:29.543
He'd never have given us anything anyway.

43:29.619 --> 43:32.189
Well, he certainly isn't going to now.

43:32.266 --> 43:33.417
What happened to his car?

43:39.100 --> 43:41.260
Will that fit our wellhead?

43:41.640 --> 43:43.851
Do kangaroos crap in the bush?

43:52.635 --> 43:55.397
We've got no choice.

43:55.474 --> 43:57.277
We need Steiger.

44:08.171 --> 44:10.243
Dr. Callahan?

44:27.619 --> 44:29.614
Sorry, I...

44:29.691 --> 44:31.494
I just have some traveler's checks.

44:31.571 --> 44:34.754
I'm leaving tomorrow, so I...
I thought I'd leave them here.

44:34.831 --> 44:37.363
Elliott usually deals with all that.

44:37.440 --> 44:38.859
Should I give them...?

44:39.260 --> 44:40.624
No, I mean, it's okay,
I'll give them to him.

44:40.701 --> 44:41.660
Okay.

44:44.153 --> 44:47.222
So... is he going to shut you down?

44:47.298 --> 44:48.756
Maybe.

44:48.833 --> 44:52.707
But we always turn up again... somewhere.

44:52.784 --> 44:55.852
I really admire you for the work you do.

44:56.190 --> 44:57.809
Oh, Jesus. "Admire," what does that mean?

44:57.847 --> 44:59.500
Why are you so difficult

44:59.880 --> 45:00.648
to talk to?
- Why are you?

45:00.724 --> 45:02.604
Why do you never say my name?

45:02.719 --> 45:04.330
Sorry?

45:04.407 --> 45:06.325
You never say my name.

45:06.401 --> 45:07.744
Why?

45:07.821 --> 45:11.350
What's the first thing you
do when you get a cold?

45:11.427 --> 45:12.692
What?

45:12.769 --> 45:14.074
What is the first thing you
do when you get a cold?

45:17.718 --> 45:19.789
Chicken soup, aspirin, scotch.

45:19.827 --> 45:21.285
You ever just have the cold?

45:22.398 --> 45:23.318
I don't under...

45:23.357 --> 45:25.083
Taken nothing, just have the cold.

45:25.160 --> 45:26.042
No.
- No.

45:26.119 --> 45:27.538
And that's us, right?

45:27.615 --> 45:29.609
We drown it, kill it, numb it.

45:29.686 --> 45:31.221
Anything not to feel.

45:31.297 --> 45:33.292
You know, when I was a doctor in London,

45:33.330 --> 45:35.200
no one ever said "matanay."

45:35.700 --> 45:37.640
They don't thank you
like they thank you here

45:37.013 --> 45:38.509
'cause here they feel everything.

45:38.547 --> 45:39.660
Straight from God.

45:39.698 --> 45:42.383
There's no drugs, there's no painkillers.

45:42.421 --> 45:49.020
It's the weirdest, purest thing-- suffering.

45:49.096 --> 45:52.242
And when you've seen that
kind of courage in a lit...

45:56.615 --> 46:00.144
...in a child...

46:00.221 --> 46:02.100
how could you ever want to do anything

46:02.139 --> 46:03.750
but just take them in your arm?

46:11.806 --> 46:13.685
You remember that boy in London. Jojo?

46:13.762 --> 46:15.641
Yes, of course.

46:15.680 --> 46:18.327
He was my first save, 10 years old.

46:18.480 --> 46:20.667
So thin he could barely stand.

46:20.743 --> 46:24.170
But he still found the strength
to bury the rest of his family.

46:27.533 --> 46:29.336
We have no idea what courage is.

46:32.730 --> 46:36.202
He used to write me these little notes.

46:36.279 --> 46:37.200
He helped me in the clinic.

46:37.276 --> 46:40.422
He was good.

46:40.537 --> 46:42.148
He was sweet, he was good.

46:42.225 --> 46:44.526
He wanted to be like me, I liked that.

46:44.603 --> 46:46.740
I mean, it was silly and childish,

46:46.061 --> 46:47.710
but it made me feel good about myself.

46:47.787 --> 46:49.398
So I took him with me to London,

46:49.437 --> 46:51.661
you know, my talisman, my courageous Africa.

46:55.120 --> 46:58.068
How could I be so bloody stupid?

46:58.106 --> 47:01.597
How could I be so totally selfish?

47:10.726 --> 47:15.330
The point is...

47:15.406 --> 47:19.664
he was my friend.

47:19.741 --> 47:23.347
He had a name.

47:23.423 --> 47:26.840
So now I have to remember him.

47:31.320 --> 47:34.586
If everyone I lose has a name...

48:04.392 --> 48:05.466
Hey.

48:05.504 --> 48:06.425
Hey.

48:06.463 --> 48:07.691
You all set?

48:07.768 --> 48:08.880
Yeah.

48:09.470 --> 48:10.223
Said your good-byes?

48:10.299 --> 48:11.335
Yeah.

48:11.412 --> 48:12.640
Well.

48:12.716 --> 48:13.598
Yeah.

48:13.675 --> 48:14.557
Oh, um,

48:14.634 --> 48:17.818
this is my friend at UNHCR.

48:17.856 --> 48:20.119
She'll always know how to get ahold of us.

48:20.158 --> 48:22.120
And that's a very good group of people.

48:22.890 --> 48:24.450
If you ever want to jump in there...

48:24.032 --> 48:25.810
Okay.

48:25.107 --> 48:26.142
Um...

48:26.219 --> 48:29.211
I'm so glad that you came, Sarah.

48:29.288 --> 48:31.206
It meant a lot to us.

48:31.282 --> 48:32.165
Oh, thank you.

48:32.241 --> 48:34.198
No, no, I'm thanking you.

48:35.502 --> 48:37.228
Mikanalay.

48:37.305 --> 48:38.801
It means "thank you."

48:38.878 --> 48:40.374
And then you say, "Genzubka,"

48:40.451 --> 48:43.059
which means, "You're welcome."

48:43.136 --> 48:44.018
Genzubka.

48:44.095 --> 48:46.260
Yeah, pretty good.

48:46.013 --> 48:47.470
Well, very Buddhist.

48:47.547 --> 48:48.890
Do Buddhists hug?

48:49.560 --> 48:50.846
Sure I hug, I'm American.

48:51.130 --> 48:52.304
I hug everything.

49:02.220 --> 49:03.121
Ah, Nick's up at the well.

49:03.198 --> 49:05.346
You want me to get him?
- No, no.

49:07.686 --> 49:08.607
Good-bye.

49:08.683 --> 49:09.796
Good-bye.

49:09.872 --> 49:11.791
You take care of yourself...

49:11.867 --> 49:13.478
and everybody else.

49:13.555 --> 49:15.320
I'll try.

49:15.396 --> 49:16.777
Keep in touch.

50:29.508 --> 50:30.659
Jim.

50:30.774 --> 50:32.150
Hey, come on.

50:32.001 --> 50:32.884
Jim!

50:33.500 --> 50:34.495
Baby, Mommy's got some work to do.

50:34.571 --> 50:35.607
Come on, honey. Come here.

50:35.684 --> 50:36.720
It's okay. It's okay, sweetie.

50:36.796 --> 50:38.024
Honey, I'm going to count to 5.

50:38.062 --> 50:39.730
No.
- One...

50:39.021 --> 50:40.479
two, three...

50:41.745 --> 50:42.665
I'll read you 2 chapters.

50:42.742 --> 50:44.600
No. 3.

50:44.046 --> 50:46.156
Okay, 3.

50:46.233 --> 50:48.266
You are nothing

50:48.343 --> 50:49.608
but a minx-ish minx.

50:49.647 --> 50:51.030
Daddy!

50:53.291 --> 50:54.442
Yeah, hello.

50:54.518 --> 50:56.436
Mommy says I can have 3 chapters.

50:56.513 --> 50:57.395
3 chapters?

50:57.472 --> 50:58.891
Excellent.

50:59.580 --> 51:00.119
Would you mind reading to him tonight?

51:00.196 --> 51:01.150
I have some work to do.

51:01.001 --> 51:02.037
Sure.

51:02.114 --> 51:03.763
Jim, go on, jump into bed.

51:03.840 --> 51:05.029
Oh!
- Quick kicks!

51:05.106 --> 51:06.832
Dad'll be there in a minute.

51:08.367 --> 51:10.400
So what's he reading?

51:10.476 --> 51:11.819
It's on his bedside table.

51:12.778 --> 51:13.890
Right.

51:15.160 --> 51:16.499
About tomorrow...

51:16.576 --> 51:17.765
I'm in the office all day.

51:17.803 --> 51:19.529
It's just, I need
to keep looking for work.

51:19.606 --> 51:21.562
I thought you were going
to make calls from home.

51:21.639 --> 51:22.790
Well, I-I just should go in.

51:22.828 --> 51:24.100
Half the city is looking.

51:24.690 --> 51:25.322
I can't compete unless I'm there.

51:25.399 --> 51:27.470
Can't your father call somebody?

51:27.547 --> 51:30.117
He's already done everything he can.

51:30.155 --> 51:31.843
Dad lost everything in the market crash,

51:31.881 --> 51:32.802
like everybody else.

51:32.879 --> 51:34.430
I know that.

51:34.068 --> 51:35.679
I know, I'm sorry.

51:35.755 --> 51:36.638
I'm sorry.

51:36.714 --> 51:38.249
So...

51:38.326 --> 51:40.359
I think I should go in.

51:40.435 --> 51:41.855
Henry, I arranged meetings,

51:42.220 --> 51:44.195
especially because you said
you'd do the school run.

51:44.233 --> 51:46.036
Well, can't we ask someone?

51:46.074 --> 51:47.494
There must be people at his school...

51:47.570 --> 51:48.414
You call.

51:48.491 --> 51:50.140
I'm sick of asking for favors.

51:51.675 --> 51:53.100
Don't. Don't!

51:53.690 --> 51:54.820
You didn't bother doing it
in the first place,

51:54.897 --> 51:55.780
don't do it now.

51:55.856 --> 51:56.739
I was trying to help.

51:56.815 --> 51:57.698
No, you were bargaining.

51:57.774 --> 51:59.150
What if I was?

52:00.690 --> 52:02.416
Is that a crime?

52:02.454 --> 52:05.063
You know, because I can argue...

52:05.139 --> 52:06.520
I can shout.

52:08.170 --> 52:09.704
I hate this situation.

52:09.781 --> 52:12.466
I hate not having a job.

52:12.504 --> 52:13.617
I don't see what good

52:13.693 --> 52:17.060
it does to make each other
feel worse than we already do.

52:23.705 --> 52:24.780
Sarah.

52:24.818 --> 52:27.180
Look at this room-- it's a mess.

52:27.005 --> 52:28.731
We'll sort it out.

52:28.807 --> 52:30.227
Things will pick up.

52:31.838 --> 52:34.561
There's a chance, I've got
a meeting with this guy

52:34.638 --> 52:35.866
who's really big in futures,

52:36.320 --> 52:39.088
and I'm going to try
and get a meeting with him.

52:40.431 --> 52:42.655
We will sort it out.

52:45.187 --> 52:48.390
He's waiting for you to read to him.

52:54.087 --> 52:55.084
Okay.

53:12.001 --> 53:12.883
Thanks.

53:13.500 --> 53:14.302
I understand.

53:15.453 --> 53:18.750
Michael... Michael, that's bullshit.

53:19.136 --> 53:22.742
UNHCR sends more aid to Honduras
than any other UN agency.

53:22.818 --> 53:24.736
Even as I speak...

53:24.813 --> 53:26.616
Well, most people don't even
know where Honduras is.

53:26.693 --> 53:28.227
...East and West Berliners alike
are tearing down

53:28.304 --> 53:29.762
the greatest symbol
of Communist repression...

53:29.838 --> 53:30.721
No.

53:30.797 --> 53:34.058
North of Panama in the Caribbean Sea.

53:34.135 --> 53:36.513
But you must keep repeating it
to yourself to believe it.

53:36.589 --> 53:38.124
The Berlin Wall is finally coming down.

53:38.201 --> 53:40.886
And the sense of hope you get here...

53:41.140 --> 53:42.343
Which is precisely why I need aid.

53:42.420 --> 53:44.300
November 9, 1989,

53:44.377 --> 53:46.525
a night that marked the opening
of a new chapter

53:46.602 --> 53:47.637
in world history.

53:47.714 --> 53:49.018
Michael, I have to call you back.

53:49.095 --> 53:50.092
Okay.

53:50.207 --> 53:51.588
UNHCR.

53:51.665 --> 53:52.701
Sarah?

53:52.777 --> 53:54.005
Yes. Who's calling?

53:54.082 --> 53:55.846
Uh, it's me, Elliott.

53:56.520 --> 53:57.457
Elliott?

53:57.496 --> 53:58.723
Hi.

53:58.838 --> 54:00.020
Hi!

54:00.790 --> 54:01.715
How... how are you? Are you okay?

54:01.792 --> 54:02.713
Oh, oh, yeah.

54:02.751 --> 54:03.672
Where are you?

54:03.710 --> 54:06.250
Um, Oh, I'm actually, believe it or not,

54:06.012 --> 54:08.659
I'm here in a phone booth in-in London.

54:08.697 --> 54:10.577
Oh, my God.

54:10.615 --> 54:12.379
You know, I'm sorry,
there's a terrible connection...

54:12.456 --> 54:14.336
but nothing seems to work
in this shitty place.

54:14.413 --> 54:15.448
When can I see you?

54:15.525 --> 54:17.712
Oh, uh, well, um...

54:17.750 --> 54:20.588
I'm in the Holland Park
Tube Station right now.

54:20.665 --> 54:22.814
Uh, could you meet me
by the entrance to the park?

54:22.890 --> 54:24.003
Yeah.

54:24.079 --> 54:25.806
Oh...
- Yes, yes, of course!

54:25.882 --> 54:27.071
Great.
- Um, uh...

54:27.148 --> 54:29.143
1:30, is that... is that okay?

54:29.220 --> 54:30.179
Sounds perfect.

54:47.320 --> 54:48.016
Henry?

54:48.054 --> 54:49.650
Hi, honey.

54:49.052 --> 54:50.471
Bea just popped around to say hello.

54:50.548 --> 54:52.427
Do you remember Bea?
She used to work with Dad.

54:52.543 --> 54:53.502
Hi, there.

54:53.578 --> 54:54.844
Hi.

54:56.148 --> 54:58.105
I thought you had job interviews today.

54:58.143 --> 55:00.713
Uh, they all got canceled.

55:00.790 --> 55:02.100
Oh.

55:06.045 --> 55:08.232
I-I just came by to get
some warm stuff for Jimmy,

55:08.308 --> 55:09.728
so I'm going to go pick him up.

55:23.576 --> 55:25.187
Hello.

55:30.289 --> 55:31.708
Hey.

55:31.785 --> 55:33.012
He-He-Hey.

55:33.089 --> 55:34.546
Oh...

55:34.623 --> 55:37.078
Oh, my gosh. Look at you.

55:37.117 --> 55:38.766
Here, come, sit.

55:41.810 --> 55:43.760
Oh, gosh, it's good to see you.

55:43.063 --> 55:44.290
Well, you, too.

55:44.367 --> 55:46.745
So you got my last letter?

55:46.783 --> 55:48.471
Yeah. You were in Pakistan.

55:48.548 --> 55:49.622
Pakistan?

55:49.660 --> 55:51.195
That was months ago.

55:51.272 --> 55:52.154
Haven't I...?

55:52.231 --> 55:53.803
You've been busy saving lives.

55:54.090 --> 55:55.453
It's okay, I forgive you.

55:55.530 --> 55:58.713
Well... well, we're not in Pakistan anymore.

55:58.790 --> 56:01.629
We're in Cambodia, by the Thai border.

56:03.432 --> 56:05.273
You okay?

56:06.270 --> 56:07.728
How's home?

56:07.805 --> 56:08.840
Fine.

56:09.070 --> 56:10.605
Jimmy?

56:10.682 --> 56:12.063
Gorgeous.

56:12.140 --> 56:13.751
But bien sur.

56:13.827 --> 56:19.570
So, you're in London, and you
called me out of the blue.

56:19.044 --> 56:21.844
Is that because I'm with the
United Nations or just because

56:22.110 --> 56:24.069
I'd never forgive you if you didn't?

56:24.146 --> 56:25.489
Both.

56:27.700 --> 56:28.340
Tell me.

56:28.020 --> 56:31.013
What do you know about Cambodia?

56:31.089 --> 56:33.890
There's a civil war going on,

56:34.560 --> 56:37.480
Communist coalition forces
headed by the Khmer Rouge

56:37.870 --> 56:39.452
versus Communist Vietnamese
running the government.

56:39.528 --> 56:41.600
I believe the British
calls it political irony.

56:41.638 --> 56:44.400
Yeah. Well, Nick calls it a clusterfuck.

56:44.477 --> 56:45.551
But that's Nick,

56:45.628 --> 56:47.431
not one that minces words.

56:47.507 --> 56:49.348
How is he?

56:49.425 --> 56:51.880
Is he good?

56:52.456 --> 56:54.220
He's Nick.

56:54.374 --> 56:56.752
Was it his idea for you to come here?

56:56.829 --> 56:59.015
No. No, both of us.

56:59.092 --> 57:01.777
I mean, I... I wanted to see you anyway,

57:01.854 --> 57:05.498
and you know, I always do this...

57:05.575 --> 57:08.050
Nick can't pitch to... save his life.

57:08.820 --> 57:10.140
Well, you saw that.

57:10.178 --> 57:12.403
Sorry, where, where, where was I?

57:12.480 --> 57:13.630
Cambodia.

57:13.707 --> 57:15.250
Ah, right.

57:15.011 --> 57:17.275
Well... according to Washington,

57:17.390 --> 57:18.809
the place doesn't officially exist,

57:18.886 --> 57:21.111
although there's something
like half a million people

57:21.187 --> 57:23.800
living under Khmer Rouge domination.

57:23.067 --> 57:24.103
Dysentery, measles,

57:24.180 --> 57:26.136
pneumonia, no vaccines, of course,

57:26.213 --> 57:28.783
so death rates run 15 to 20 people a day

57:28.859 --> 57:32.235
in every village, and there's
land mines, lots of them.

57:32.312 --> 57:35.227
So, we have amputees without prosthetics.

57:35.304 --> 57:36.762
It's not a happy place.

57:36.800 --> 57:38.027
So what do you need?

57:38.104 --> 57:40.740
Well, I put together
a shipment of supplies,

57:40.060 --> 57:42.300
vaccines, medicines, the usual.

57:42.017 --> 57:46.390
But there's so much corruption
out there, I was wondering,

57:46.467 --> 57:48.385
I mean, the thing would be if...

57:48.461 --> 57:50.878
Elliott, just... just say it.

57:51.830 --> 57:54.369
If we could put a UN stamp on it.

57:54.445 --> 57:56.900
I mean, the point is, the UN
name still means something.

57:57.670 --> 57:58.665
You know, just a little bit
of extra protection.

57:58.742 --> 58:00.468
Obviously, I would take
full responsibility.

58:00.621 --> 58:02.118
You just do the paperwork.

58:02.194 --> 58:05.647
Well, we do have shipments going
into Thailand and Cambodia.

58:05.723 --> 58:09.061
So, I'll attach your name to the list.

58:10.480 --> 58:11.400
Thank you.

58:11.439 --> 58:12.897
And I'll go with it. I'll see it through.

58:13.630 --> 58:14.047
Oh, no, you don't need to.

58:14.124 --> 58:15.620
I know, but I do this now.

58:15.697 --> 58:17.730
Yeah, but Cambodia is different.

58:17.883 --> 58:19.763
I'll see it through.

58:41.590 --> 58:43.610
So, what is it, what do they want?

58:43.048 --> 58:44.200
Money, Miss Sarah.

58:44.007 --> 58:45.886
Shit! They see you, they want more.

58:46.530 --> 58:47.152
Always more money, huh?!

58:51.218 --> 58:52.599
I'm not playing their games.
- What?

58:52.676 --> 58:54.057
I'm not giving them any more money.

58:54.095 --> 58:55.093
They want their money.

58:55.169 --> 58:57.240
They've already gotten the 10%

58:57.620 --> 58:59.120
that's written in the contract.
- Contract shit, you pay.

59:01.153 --> 59:02.535
No.
- Miss Sarah.

59:02.573 --> 59:04.107
I'm not giving them any more money.

59:04.184 --> 59:05.872
They need more, you pay. You no say no.

59:06.390 --> 59:07.483
Tell them to get the rest of that shipment

59:07.560 --> 59:09.017
off the boat right now.
- What? Or what?

59:09.094 --> 59:10.660
What you do?

59:10.053 --> 59:11.319
This not Chelsea football.

59:11.396 --> 59:12.393
This Cambodia.

59:12.546 --> 59:14.349
You pay. You pay!

59:30.844 --> 59:32.072
It's 2 weeks late.

59:32.148 --> 59:33.568
What the hell is going on, Steiger?

59:35.217 --> 59:36.099
You want a beer?

59:36.176 --> 59:37.711
I want to know what's going on.

59:39.092 --> 59:41.610
Crates were late, so...

59:41.048 --> 59:42.200
Shit happens. So what?

59:42.007 --> 59:43.158
Have you got any idea how fast

59:43.234 --> 59:45.510
a measles epidemic spreads in 2 weeks?

59:45.037 --> 59:47.032
I've got enough stains
in my laundry, Callahan.

59:47.109 --> 59:48.758
You're not my only child.

59:50.024 --> 59:51.597
Just give me the money.

59:55.126 --> 59:58.003
Bringing your titty
from the UN was a smart idea.

59:59.461 --> 01:00:01.609
You want to screw? Take your pick.

01:00:06.327 --> 01:00:07.363
25 thousand.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:10.610
And tell that sorry excuse for a colonel

01:00:10.048 --> 01:00:12.657
that it's 25 more than he deserves.

01:00:14.613 --> 01:00:15.572
Mrs. Bauford is waiting.

01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:16.531
Listen, you piece of shit.

01:00:16.569 --> 01:00:17.643
Fucking with me is one thing,

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.833
but if anything happens to her...

01:00:18.871 --> 01:00:20.350
Then what?

01:00:20.022 --> 01:00:23.090
Remember, Callahan, I'm the guy
that makes you possible.

01:00:23.129 --> 01:00:25.699
You owe me, you took the fucking money,

01:00:25.776 --> 01:00:28.231
now you will do this,
and you will do this right.

01:00:29.765 --> 01:00:32.412
What's the matter? Scared of the dark?

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.325
Now fuck off and save lives.

01:01:21.359 --> 01:01:23.623
How'd that happen?

01:01:23.699 --> 01:01:25.732
If I can ask.

01:01:27.305 --> 01:01:29.060
Oh.

01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:30.719
Before time,

01:01:30.796 --> 01:01:34.555
I was sick, bad lung, TB.

01:01:34.632 --> 01:01:37.125
At this time no doctor where I live.

01:01:37.202 --> 01:01:39.082
Khmer Rouge kill our doctor.

01:01:39.158 --> 01:01:42.803
So, I walk to border for medicine,

01:01:42.879 --> 01:01:47.099
but I must cross the mine field first.

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:49.324
You never forget that sound.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.664
The first thing you hear is click.

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:54.272
It's your foot priming the land mine.

01:01:54.349 --> 01:01:55.768
Soon as you hear it,

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:58.722
it's over.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.676
But your mind go crazy, you know?

01:02:01.752 --> 01:02:04.476
You thinking, maybe if I jump,

01:02:04.553 --> 01:02:08.235
maybe if I find a rock
to match my weight...

01:02:08.312 --> 01:02:12.186
But it's nothing you can do.

01:02:12.263 --> 01:02:15.102
You hear the click and big bye-bye.

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:16.751
But,

01:02:16.828 --> 01:02:18.823
I was lucky.

01:02:18.899 --> 01:02:20.357
Just lose my leg.

01:02:47.171 --> 01:02:48.552
Any problems?

01:02:48.628 --> 01:02:50.163
None.

01:03:08.882 --> 01:03:11.050
You're not wearing perfume.

01:03:23.459 --> 01:03:27.832
So, are you going to tell me
where we're going?

01:03:29.367 --> 01:03:31.055
A place near Pailin,

01:03:31.131 --> 01:03:33.011
by the border.

01:03:33.088 --> 01:03:35.389
And the boat's the best way to travel?

01:03:35.466 --> 01:03:37.346
You don't like my boat?

01:03:39.685 --> 01:03:41.105
I think it's very you.

01:03:43.023 --> 01:03:44.711
It's safer.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.319
Avoids the road blocks,

01:03:47.396 --> 01:03:51.117
the Viet troops,
plus other assorted madness.

01:03:51.193 --> 01:03:53.802
You know, heart of darkness.

01:03:53.879 --> 01:03:55.810
The horror.

01:03:57.254 --> 01:03:59.287
Actually it is.

01:03:59.364 --> 01:04:00.707
Horrible.

01:04:00.745 --> 01:04:02.817
And now you're going to tell me why.

01:04:02.855 --> 01:04:04.198
Well, Elliott's no good, is he?

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:06.422
All he gives you is the Buddhist version,

01:04:06.499 --> 01:04:07.496
all fucking temples

01:04:07.573 --> 01:04:10.719
and gentle people, which is bollocks.

01:04:10.796 --> 01:04:11.831
The Khmer Rouge--

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.056
rouge being very much
the appropriate color--

01:04:14.133 --> 01:04:15.475
used Pailin as a hideout.

01:04:15.552 --> 01:04:17.700
Everyone lives in absolute terror.

01:04:17.739 --> 01:04:19.887
They use the women
as baby-making factories,

01:04:20.530 --> 01:04:21.191
the kids as mine sweepers,

01:04:21.268 --> 01:04:23.301
and just in case
we actually help anybody,

01:04:23.378 --> 01:04:24.835
they come and steal everything

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:26.760
that we don't hide.

01:04:26.063 --> 01:04:28.019
So why do they let you stay at all?

01:04:28.096 --> 01:04:30.167
They've got no doctors.

01:04:36.305 --> 01:04:38.184
I should be singing "Old Man River."

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.059
Please don't.

01:05:40.174 --> 01:05:43.051
Colonel Tao, how are you doing?

01:05:44.049 --> 01:05:46.180
It's good to see you again.

01:05:57.359 --> 01:05:59.354
The boxes, they for who?

01:05:59.431 --> 01:06:01.771
Well, you know who they're for.

01:06:01.848 --> 01:06:02.883
I give you my word.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:04.533
This goes only to the women and children.

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:13.317
Wait, easy, that's medicine,
for Christ's sake!

01:06:32.382 --> 01:06:33.648
I don't understand, what's the problem?

01:06:38.481 --> 01:06:39.402
It's a laptop.

01:06:39.441 --> 01:06:40.630
Every NGO has got one.

01:06:40.706 --> 01:06:42.202
That's the way we do business here.

01:06:42.279 --> 01:06:43.775
Don't throw those away.

01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:46.729
People's lives depend on that,
for fuck's sake!

01:06:52.138 --> 01:06:53.020
Colonel...
- Sarah...

01:06:53.097 --> 01:06:54.690
I'm with UNHCR, United Nations.

01:06:54.056 --> 01:06:55.168
This cargo is protected.

01:06:55.245 --> 01:06:57.009
If this shipment is harmed in any way,

01:06:57.086 --> 01:06:58.544
your name will surface
in the follow-up investigation.

01:06:58.620 --> 01:06:59.541
I don't...

01:07:24.552 --> 01:07:26.546
I promise you, I know nothing about this.

01:07:26.623 --> 01:07:27.621
Somebody must have...

01:07:48.105 --> 01:07:49.639
Colonel Tao, you know me.

01:07:49.716 --> 01:07:50.790
I swear to God,

01:07:50.828 --> 01:07:52.690
I don't...

01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:10.315
Son of a bitch!

01:09:22.163 --> 01:09:23.006
What was that?

01:09:23.122 --> 01:09:24.120
You explain it to me.

01:09:24.197 --> 01:09:25.462
I can't explain it to you.

01:09:25.501 --> 01:09:26.421
We were set up.

01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:27.572
I knew nothing about that book,

01:09:27.649 --> 01:09:29.430
what was in the box, the equipment...

01:09:29.029 --> 01:09:31.484
Did you know about the guns?

01:09:31.562 --> 01:09:34.055
Did you know about the guns?

01:09:34.131 --> 01:09:35.321
Answer me! Did you know...?

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:36.471
Yes, I knew about them.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.578
I came here to help these people,

01:09:39.617 --> 01:09:41.109
and the only way I can do that

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:42.609
is if I transport guns.
- You don't have

01:09:42.685 --> 01:09:43.798
to transport guns to help people.

01:09:43.875 --> 01:09:45.390
You do here.

01:09:45.779 --> 01:09:46.714
Right. So fuck the next person
that tries to bring

01:09:46.791 --> 01:09:48.210
a shipment full of medicine in for people.

01:09:48.287 --> 01:09:50.205
Fuck them.

01:09:50.243 --> 01:09:51.356
As long as you get what you need today,

01:09:51.432 --> 01:09:52.468
fuck everybody else!

01:09:52.545 --> 01:09:53.618
No one else comes here,

01:09:53.694 --> 01:09:54.846
so what do you want me to do?

01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:57.148
You want me to watch
thousands of kids die of measles

01:09:57.186 --> 01:09:58.529
'cause l wouldn't bend the rules?

01:09:58.606 --> 01:09:59.756
Is that a price worth paying?

01:09:59.833 --> 01:10:01.559
Or am I actually killing more than I save?

01:10:01.636 --> 01:10:03.861
You seriously believe that
I don't worry about that?

01:10:03.899 --> 01:10:06.277
That I don't think about that
every minute of every day?

01:10:06.354 --> 01:10:08.579
What's worse? You tell me.

01:10:08.656 --> 01:10:10.612
You tell me what I should do.

01:10:29.639 --> 01:10:31.720
What happened?

01:10:50.276 --> 01:10:52.578
Never compromise another organization

01:10:52.655 --> 01:10:55.110
for your own ever again.

01:10:55.225 --> 01:10:57.526
I won't.

01:10:58.562 --> 01:11:00.020
Sarah, you made it.

01:11:00.097 --> 01:11:01.631
Oh, good to see you.

01:11:01.708 --> 01:11:05.084
So, I believe congratulations are in order?

01:11:05.122 --> 01:11:07.002
I know, can you believe it?

01:11:07.078 --> 01:11:08.510
Oh...

01:11:08.037 --> 01:11:09.610
What the hell happened?

01:11:09.687 --> 01:11:11.758
No guns-- confiscated by Tao.

01:11:11.835 --> 01:11:14.175
He found these intelligence files.

01:11:14.213 --> 01:11:15.671
They freaked him out.

01:11:15.748 --> 01:11:16.668
What intelligence files?

01:11:16.707 --> 01:11:17.781
Well, how do I know?

01:11:17.858 --> 01:11:19.008
He was tipped off.
He was waiting for us.

01:11:19.085 --> 01:11:20.504
He found these documents.
He went fucking crazy.

01:11:20.581 --> 01:11:22.652
Well, if we don't have anything
for the Khmer Rouge,

01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:23.650
we're in deep shit.

01:11:23.688 --> 01:11:24.608
We leave in the morning.

01:11:24.647 --> 01:11:25.644
Take everyone with us.

01:11:25.721 --> 01:11:26.834
No, we need to leave sooner than that.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.636
We've got all this vaccine.
I'm not wasting it.

01:11:28.752 --> 01:11:30.324
We don't have time. We need to go now.

01:11:30.401 --> 01:11:31.513
Not until we vaccinate.

01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:33.854
This is not worth risking our lives for.

01:11:34.889 --> 01:11:38.265
You do whatever you got to do.
I'm staying.

01:11:58.135 --> 01:11:59.785
Joss, remember to pack the iodine.

01:11:59.861 --> 01:12:02.010
And the emergency kits-- how many we got?

01:12:02.048 --> 01:12:03.161
Joss?

01:12:16.625 --> 01:12:17.546
No, no. They...

01:12:18.888 --> 01:12:22.648
He says that we're thieves,
that we stole his files

01:12:22.686 --> 01:12:24.872
and his guns, and he wants them back.

01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:26.867
Tell him the truth.

01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:28.516
And tell him that we're trying

01:12:28.593 --> 01:12:30.473
to save his bloody people.

01:12:37.454 --> 01:12:39.871
He doesn't give a shit about the people.

01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:41.329
He just want the file.

01:12:41.405 --> 01:12:42.748
So tell him whatever he wants.

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:45.318
Just try and buy us some time.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:56.826
He wants us to...

01:12:57.310 --> 01:12:57.900
He wants us to what?

01:12:59.511 --> 01:13:01.775
He wants us to make amends now.

01:13:01.851 --> 01:13:04.038
He wants us to go to Pailin.

01:13:04.114 --> 01:13:05.304
You know what that means.

01:13:06.301 --> 01:13:07.183
He say now.

01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:08.142
Okay.

01:13:08.219 --> 01:13:11.787
Tell him that Sarah is from the UN.

01:13:11.863 --> 01:13:13.705
And that the UN is very
important to Big God Ankha,

01:13:13.743 --> 01:13:15.661
and if anything happens to her or to us,

01:13:15.737 --> 01:13:16.888
the UN will crucify him.

01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:32.578
He say you are a CIA agent
working for Vietnam.

01:13:32.616 --> 01:13:35.877
One of you must die.

01:13:47.768 --> 01:13:52.026
English doctor, you say
all you care about is my people.

01:14:26.704 --> 01:14:28.852
Life mean nothing.

01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:31.520
We serve only Ankha.

01:14:31.038 --> 01:14:32.803
Now you will see.

01:14:32.879 --> 01:14:34.414
For God's sake, he's just a baby.

01:14:41.549 --> 01:14:42.393
Tell them to drop their guns.

01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:45.577
Tell them to drop their fucking weapons now!

01:14:46.842 --> 01:14:48.377
No!

01:14:48.454 --> 01:14:49.873
Tell them to back off. Back off!

01:14:55.052 --> 01:14:56.394
Tell them to back off.

01:14:56.471 --> 01:14:57.353
Tell them to back off.

01:17:05.782 --> 01:17:08.590
Look, as long as we hold due west,

01:17:08.046 --> 01:17:09.350
we hit the river.

01:17:09.427 --> 01:17:10.692
That's about 2 miles.

01:17:10.769 --> 01:17:12.035
And the camp's up there.

01:17:12.189 --> 01:17:14.452
About another 3 miles north,
just over the Thai border.

01:17:14.490 --> 01:17:16.408
Oh, Jesus.

01:17:16.446 --> 01:17:18.320
Shit. That's Khmer Rouge.

01:17:18.019 --> 01:17:19.132
They've reached the village.

01:17:19.209 --> 01:17:20.896
At this rate, they're going to catch up.

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:49.628
Keep them moving.

01:17:49.705 --> 01:17:51.086
Keep them moving!

01:17:52.352 --> 01:17:53.694
Tell them we're nearly there.

01:17:58.643 --> 01:18:00.370
Sierra Tango 619.

01:18:01.635 --> 01:18:03.131
Sierra Tango 619.

01:18:03.208 --> 01:18:05.777
This is Outpost Grade 7.

01:18:10.266 --> 01:18:12.068
Sierra Tango, come in.

01:18:27.182 --> 01:18:30.059
Me father. Me father.

01:18:45.135 --> 01:18:48.204
Look! Look! Helicopter!

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:50.160
Helicopter!

01:18:51.426 --> 01:18:53.574
Helicopter!

01:19:01.131 --> 01:19:02.666
Looks Vietnamese, mate.

01:19:02.742 --> 01:19:05.466
Good, that will keep them busy.

01:19:36.384 --> 01:19:38.686
Nick?

01:19:44.094 --> 01:19:46.012
It wasn't your fault.

01:19:46.089 --> 01:19:47.393
Yes, it was.

01:19:47.508 --> 01:19:48.889
If I'd have listened to him,

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:52.572
none of this would have happened.

01:19:52.649 --> 01:19:54.720
I couldn't even bury him properly.

01:19:54.758 --> 01:19:57.520
I didn't even give him
a decent fucking burial.

01:19:57.597 --> 01:20:00.129
Elliott wanted to dedicate his life

01:20:00.205 --> 01:20:02.737
to helping other people.

01:20:02.852 --> 01:20:06.113
And in the end, he died for them.

01:20:06.190 --> 01:20:08.760
Be proud of him.

01:20:08.837 --> 01:20:15.204
Miss him... but be proud of him.

01:20:15.319 --> 01:20:21.610
I don't know what
I'm going to do without him.

01:20:21.687 --> 01:20:25.792
I can't stop; I've got to keep going.

01:20:25.868 --> 01:20:29.704
There's so much...
- I'm worried about you, here.

01:20:29.781 --> 01:20:33.694
I'm worried that something
is going to happen to you.

01:20:33.732 --> 01:20:35.458
Every day for 4 years,

01:20:35.535 --> 01:20:37.530
every morning, I wake up and I wonder

01:20:37.607 --> 01:20:39.141
if you're okay, if you're still alive,

01:20:39.256 --> 01:20:40.292
where you are.

01:21:36.489 --> 01:21:39.558
Shall l ring down for some room service?

01:21:39.596 --> 01:21:43.202
Chocolate cake...

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:44.736
and some air-conditioning.

01:21:44.813 --> 01:21:47.076
That'd be lovely.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.592
How did you meet Henry?

01:21:55.630 --> 01:21:58.009
I was staring at a Roscoe.

01:21:58.086 --> 01:22:00.425
What's that, some sort of dishwasher?

01:22:00.503 --> 01:22:02.120
It was a painting.

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:04.530
I used to work at an art gallery.

01:22:04.645 --> 01:22:07.791
And one day, Henry came in.

01:22:07.867 --> 01:22:10.246
How old were you?

01:22:10.322 --> 01:22:13.315
Too young.

01:22:13.391 --> 01:22:17.611
But you stayed together?

01:22:17.650 --> 01:22:20.488
Yeah.

01:22:20.526 --> 01:22:23.442
We've both known that
the marriage has been over

01:22:23.519 --> 01:22:24.478
for a long time.

01:22:24.554 --> 01:22:28.198
But we stayed together for Jimmy.

01:22:28.275 --> 01:22:30.500
You love him very much, don't you?

01:22:30.577 --> 01:22:33.454
He's amazing.

01:22:56.892 --> 01:22:58.618
I'm going to have to start making plans

01:22:58.694 --> 01:23:00.497
to go to New York.

01:23:00.574 --> 01:23:04.142
See Elliott's parents,
tell them what happened.

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.369
How long will you be gone?

01:23:05.446 --> 01:23:07.632
I don't know, no idea.

01:23:11.507 --> 01:23:14.130
What is this?

01:23:17.146 --> 01:23:18.603
What are you doing?

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.442
I'm absolutely crazy about you.

01:23:21.519 --> 01:23:24.050
I can't stop thinking about you.

01:23:24.127 --> 01:23:26.160
You're always in my mind;
you're in my heart;

01:23:26.237 --> 01:23:28.423
you're in every fucking bit of me.

01:23:28.462 --> 01:23:30.418
But I can't go there with you.

01:23:30.495 --> 01:23:31.608
I can't do it.

01:23:31.684 --> 01:23:33.257
Look at what happens to people around me.

01:23:33.334 --> 01:23:34.293
It's not good.

01:23:34.369 --> 01:23:35.750
I'm not good for you.
- That's not true.

01:23:35.827 --> 01:23:37.822
Listen, believe me,
if I could live this life again,

01:23:37.899 --> 01:23:39.395
I would never leave you for a second.

01:23:39.471 --> 01:23:41.504
But you belong with your family,
and I belong here,

01:23:41.581 --> 01:23:43.422
and there's nothing we can do about it.

01:23:43.499 --> 01:23:45.090
Because whichever way you look at it,

01:23:45.850 --> 01:23:46.060
somebody gets hurt.

01:24:23.202 --> 01:24:26.539
One, two, three.

01:24:27.076 --> 01:24:28.303
Oh.
- Oops.

01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:41.116
Oh!

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:51.358
Happy birthday to you

01:24:51.435 --> 01:24:55.002
Happy birthday to you

01:24:55.079 --> 01:24:59.430
Happy birthday, dear Sarah

01:24:59.030 --> 01:25:03.633
Happy birthday to you.

01:25:05.206 --> 01:25:07.600
Thank you.

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.090
Thank you, baby.

01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:14.182
Oh, that was lovely.

01:25:14.259 --> 01:25:16.599
Lovely playing, lovely cake.

01:25:16.675 --> 01:25:17.673
My playing

01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:19.169
was lovelier than his cake.

01:25:19.246 --> 01:25:20.166
Mom.

01:25:20.319 --> 01:25:22.315
They were both exactly
as lovely as each other.

01:25:22.353 --> 01:25:24.117
I think you better blow the candles out

01:25:24.194 --> 01:25:25.192
before the cake catches fire.

01:25:25.268 --> 01:25:27.800
Wait until they do you
a candle for each decade, dear.

01:25:28.050 --> 01:25:30.447
Then you'll know you're past it.

01:25:35.318 --> 01:25:36.891
Didn't forget to make a wish.

01:25:39.346 --> 01:25:40.459
Got it.

01:25:41.763 --> 01:25:42.760
Oh!

01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:51.506
Mom, when are we going to open the presents?

01:25:51.545 --> 01:25:52.772
Now.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.805
Many of you know her from her work

01:25:54.844 --> 01:25:56.570
with the Elliott Hauser Foundation

01:25:56.647 --> 01:25:59.380
for the International Promotion
of Human Rights.

01:25:59.025 --> 01:26:00.790
In more recent years however,

01:26:00.866 --> 01:26:03.091
she has become an active
lobbyist at Whitehall

01:26:03.129 --> 01:26:06.812
on issues of asylum
and refugee protection.

01:26:06.889 --> 01:26:09.689
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure

01:26:09.766 --> 01:26:12.527
to introduce our new spokesperson

01:26:12.605 --> 01:26:14.561
for the UNHCR in the United Kingdom,

01:26:14.637 --> 01:26:17.016
Mrs. Sarah Bauford.

01:26:29.176 --> 01:26:31.132
Thank you.

01:26:32.667 --> 01:26:35.006
Thank you.

01:26:35.083 --> 01:26:36.387
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:26:36.464 --> 01:26:41.643
I feel very nervous to be
standing in front of you today.

01:26:41.719 --> 01:26:44.443
I also feel very honored.

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:46.860
In particular, because
UNHCR was the organization

01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:51.502
to which I was first introduced
by my friend Elliott Hauser.

01:26:51.578 --> 01:26:53.880
I know that my being offered this post

01:26:53.074 --> 01:26:54.608
would have given him enormous pleasure.

01:26:54.647 --> 01:26:58.291
Over 50 million people

01:26:58.329 --> 01:27:02.012
are refugees or displaced
persons in the world today.

01:27:02.089 --> 01:27:05.081
And because of closed minds
and funding shortfalls,

01:27:05.157 --> 01:27:08.495
we are only able to reach
half of those in need.

01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:20.160
So we rely on our partners,

01:27:20.003 --> 01:27:22.688
the network of aid groups
blazing a trail across crises,

01:27:22.765 --> 01:27:26.332
like El Salvador, Angola,

01:27:26.409 --> 01:27:29.631
Chechnya, Sri Lanka...

01:27:29.708 --> 01:27:33.659
those NGO's, the non-
governmental groups from OXFAM

01:27:33.736 --> 01:27:35.078
right down to the smallest outfits

01:27:35.155 --> 01:27:36.536
run by people like Elliott and...

01:27:43.556 --> 01:27:46.509
...and I pray for those who survive him--

01:27:46.587 --> 01:27:48.351
who continue his work--

01:27:48.427 --> 01:27:50.806
without certainty or security--

01:27:50.882 --> 01:27:53.568
wherever they may be in this world.

01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:57.787
Excuse me.

01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:11.367
Hey.

01:28:11.443 --> 01:28:12.633
Hey.

01:28:12.710 --> 01:28:13.822
Thanks for coming.

01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:15.510
Listen, I travel thousands of miles

01:28:15.587 --> 01:28:17.083
to hear my sister give a speech,

01:28:17.159 --> 01:28:18.502
I got a backache and jet lag.

01:28:18.579 --> 01:28:20.036
What's a taxi ride to the park?

01:28:20.113 --> 01:28:22.108
Sorry. Are they angry?

01:28:22.185 --> 01:28:23.719
No. They don't care, Sarah.

01:28:23.796 --> 01:28:25.713
I think they actually kind of enjoyed it.

01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:28.053
"She's nuts" makes
for much better conversation

01:28:28.092 --> 01:28:29.434
than "Nice speech."

01:28:29.473 --> 01:28:31.813
I got a letter from Nick,

01:28:31.889 --> 01:28:34.536
and I think he's in trouble.

01:28:34.613 --> 01:28:36.569
Why? What did he say?

01:28:36.646 --> 01:28:38.717
Nothing, really. Just little things.

01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:41.364
Well, where is he?

01:28:41.441 --> 01:28:42.707
He's in Chechnya.

01:28:42.784 --> 01:28:45.220
He's running some sort of camp.

01:28:45.008 --> 01:28:46.428
I'm really not sure.

01:28:47.771 --> 01:28:49.500
I need to find him.

01:28:49.036 --> 01:28:50.456
So, you have contacts.

01:28:50.532 --> 01:28:52.374
You can find out where he is.

01:28:52.450 --> 01:28:53.870
So, please?

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:56.171
Sarah, sweetheart, you know as well as I do

01:28:56.248 --> 01:28:59.586
that Chechnya is a very dangerous place.

01:29:05.723 --> 01:29:08.332
Yes, I can angle a story there, I'm sure.

01:29:08.408 --> 01:29:11.669
If I find out anything,
I will let you know. Okay?

01:29:12.628 --> 01:29:14.891
Okay. Okay.

01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:16.349
Okay.

01:29:16.387 --> 01:29:17.806
Thank you.

01:29:22.010 --> 01:29:25.709
Perhaps we are all refugees from something,

01:29:25.824 --> 01:29:29.210
but I see now there is nothing to fear;

01:29:29.007 --> 01:29:33.112
that the world we hold on to,
the lives we cherish,

01:29:33.189 --> 01:29:37.754
are a part of something greater
--something more.

01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:41.091
When I look at my children,
I see it so clearly--

01:29:41.168 --> 01:29:42.702
that hope--

01:29:42.779 --> 01:29:45.119
that chance of life--

01:29:45.157 --> 01:29:47.382
and I know it's worth fighting for.

01:29:48.533 --> 01:29:51.026
"The wedding was a splendid affair.

01:29:51.103 --> 01:29:53.340
"Everyone attended--

01:29:53.021 --> 01:29:55.668
"the dwarves, and the animals of the forest--

01:29:55.744 --> 01:29:57.202
"and there were tears of joy

01:29:57.279 --> 01:29:58.506
"and songs of happiness,

01:29:58.583 --> 01:30:00.271
"and the prince and the princess

01:30:00.386 --> 01:30:03.493
lived happily ever after."

01:30:03.570 --> 01:30:06.025
How does it really end, Mummy?

01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:07.521
What do you mean?

01:30:07.598 --> 01:30:09.630
What do you think happens, honey?

01:30:09.708 --> 01:30:13.314
She wakes up, looks at the prince,

01:30:13.390 --> 01:30:16.536
and goes, "Eww! Boys. Yucky!"

01:30:18.223 --> 01:30:19.604
Hello.

01:30:19.681 --> 01:30:21.523
Hi, Henry. It's Charlotte. Is Sarah there?

01:30:21.599 --> 01:30:22.788
Charlotte, hi.

01:30:22.865 --> 01:30:24.898
Uh... well, she's upstairs
with the kids right now.

01:30:25.650 --> 01:30:26.010
Can I take a message?

01:30:26.087 --> 01:30:28.657
Oh. Okay. Um...
Then could you just, uh...

01:30:28.734 --> 01:30:31.879
Just let her know that
I will call her later, okay?

01:30:32.850 --> 01:30:35.140
Well, I can take a message.

01:30:35.178 --> 01:30:39.280
Um... well, then, just tell her
that I've got some news, uh...

01:30:39.015 --> 01:30:42.812
and that I will... I will fax it
to her office in the morning.

01:30:42.889 --> 01:30:44.078
Okay?

01:30:44.155 --> 01:30:45.344
Right. Okay.

01:30:45.421 --> 01:30:47.450
Um... I'll pass that on.

01:30:47.032 --> 01:30:49.678
Okay. Thanks, Henry. Bye, now.

01:30:49.755 --> 01:30:51.174
Bye.

01:31:03.028 --> 01:31:05.214
That was Charlotte.

01:31:05.291 --> 01:31:09.250
She said, um... she has some news.

01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:12.196
She'll fax you at the office.

01:32:57.456 --> 01:33:01.368
So this is it, is it?

01:33:01.445 --> 01:33:04.284
You kiss the children good-bye,
scribble a quick note, and then

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:05.742
sneak off into the night.

01:33:05.818 --> 01:33:08.388
Have you any idea
how fucking cruel that is?

01:33:08.465 --> 01:33:10.114
I'm not sneaking off.

01:33:10.230 --> 01:33:12.685
I'm not leaving the children.

01:33:12.761 --> 01:33:14.833
You could have talked to me.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.556
I mean, writing a note-- it's, uh...

01:33:17.595 --> 01:33:20.088
I just thought it would be easier.

01:33:20.165 --> 01:33:21.392
Than what?

01:33:21.431 --> 01:33:24.845
Than having this conversation again.

01:33:27.492 --> 01:33:29.525
God, this is so...

01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:39.383
I should be back by Friday.

01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:42.050
Dinners are in the freezer.

01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:44.255
Their swimsuits are in the dryer.

01:33:44.332 --> 01:33:46.825
They have swimming tomorrow at 4:00.

01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:49.203
It's all in the note.

01:33:50.853 --> 01:33:53.883
I want this to be as easy
as possible for them.

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:55.763
And we'll talk about this.

01:33:55.801 --> 01:33:59.700
We'll talk about everything when I get home.

01:35:20.530 --> 01:35:21.574
Sniper!

01:35:45.818 --> 01:35:47.889
Oh, God...

01:35:51.111 --> 01:35:52.378
This is total carnage,

01:35:52.416 --> 01:35:54.142
and not a single western leader
has said a thing

01:35:54.296 --> 01:35:55.369
about what's going on here.

01:35:55.446 --> 01:35:56.750
There's no threats, no criticism,

01:35:56.827 --> 01:35:57.863
no fucking comment.

01:35:58.300 --> 01:35:59.359
This place might as well not exist.

01:35:59.436 --> 01:36:00.855
And now that we're all they have,

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:02.581
they want us to save face for them.

01:36:02.658 --> 01:36:05.500
Well, fuck that. They should
get off their fucking asses

01:36:05.036 --> 01:36:06.762
and get the fuck out here. Shit.

01:36:06.839 --> 01:36:08.258
Sorry. I'm still swearing.

01:36:08.296 --> 01:36:09.678
Freeze it there.

01:36:09.754 --> 01:36:11.788
Can we cut?

01:36:19.651 --> 01:36:21.032
Okay.

01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:26.211
Roll tape.

01:36:26.249 --> 01:36:28.090
Basically, nothing has changed.

01:36:28.129 --> 01:36:30.162
People keep saying that
everything has changed.

01:36:30.239 --> 01:36:31.428
Not from where I'm standing.

01:36:31.504 --> 01:36:32.732
Chechnya, Somalia, Cambodia,

01:36:32.771 --> 01:36:35.034
Ethiopia-- it's the same shit every time,

01:36:35.072 --> 01:36:37.297
and it's just going to go on
and on until we stop pretending

01:36:37.374 --> 01:36:38.754
that our loyalty ends with the asshole...

01:37:01.387 --> 01:37:03.574
You okay?

01:37:03.650 --> 01:37:05.223
What do you know?

01:37:05.299 --> 01:37:07.486
An English news crew filmed it 6 days ago.

01:37:07.525 --> 01:37:10.018
The sound man is dead,
the cameraman is in a coma,

01:37:10.095 --> 01:37:11.322
and Nick has disappeared.

01:37:11.399 --> 01:37:13.048
We think it's bandits--

01:37:13.125 --> 01:37:15.158
Chechens looking for money--

01:37:15.235 --> 01:37:17.192
but there's been no ransom demand.

01:37:20.414 --> 01:37:22.562
Sarah, I want you to meet Bob Strauss.

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:24.710
He's with the ICRC here.

01:37:24.058 --> 01:37:25.515
He's been helping us.

01:37:27.817 --> 01:37:29.006
Hi.

01:37:29.083 --> 01:37:30.464
No, sit. Sit, please.

01:37:34.530 --> 01:37:36.448
So, the, um... net result right now

01:37:36.486 --> 01:37:38.174
is we don't know who took Nick.

01:37:38.251 --> 01:37:39.900
We don't know if he pissed off

01:37:40.670 --> 01:37:41.511
the Russians or the Chechens.

01:37:41.588 --> 01:37:43.622
We're pretty sure there was a motive.

01:37:43.698 --> 01:37:44.734
What was he doing?

01:37:44.811 --> 01:37:45.731
I think you know

01:37:45.808 --> 01:37:48.080
he wasn't just a doctor anymore.

01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:49.797
He, uh... I'd have to say--

01:37:49.836 --> 01:37:51.485
and this is well known--

01:37:51.562 --> 01:37:53.863
Nick's activities went quite a way

01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:55.359
beyond what you'd call famine relief.

01:37:55.398 --> 01:37:56.318
How do we find him?

01:37:56.395 --> 01:37:59.234
Well, nobody I've spoken to

01:37:59.311 --> 01:38:01.305
has any leads yet.

01:38:01.382 --> 01:38:03.300
Can we offer a reward?

01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:08.440
Can... can... can we do something?

01:38:08.517 --> 01:38:10.857
The best thing for you to do is to stay

01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:13.044
in the hotel for
a couple of days. Be patient.

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.885
No. No.

01:38:15.130 --> 01:38:16.611
No.

01:38:16.688 --> 01:38:18.107
Sarah.

01:38:19.411 --> 01:38:21.559
Sarah, listen to me.

01:38:21.636 --> 01:38:23.171
This place, they will take journalists,

01:38:23.247 --> 01:38:24.629
Red Cross, anybody.

01:38:24.705 --> 01:38:26.546
Don't think for one second
that you are immune.

01:38:26.623 --> 01:38:28.004
I don't.

01:38:28.042 --> 01:38:29.768
Just listen to what Strauss said.

01:38:29.845 --> 01:38:31.456
I don't care what Strauss said.

01:38:31.571 --> 01:38:33.259
Sarah, I love you.

01:38:33.336 --> 01:38:35.523
I want you to be safe. Go home.

01:38:35.561 --> 01:38:38.016
I swear to God, I will let you
know if we hear anything.

01:38:38.092 --> 01:38:39.013
Say it.

01:38:39.051 --> 01:38:40.620
What?

01:38:40.010 --> 01:38:41.046
Say it.

01:38:43.732 --> 01:38:46.532
People disappear here;
they don't come back.

01:38:46.608 --> 01:38:50.023
I'm not leaving until I find him.

01:38:54.089 --> 01:38:55.470
Okay.

01:39:20.557 --> 01:39:22.053
Charley?

01:39:24.048 --> 01:39:25.736
Who is it?

01:39:34.213 --> 01:39:35.479
Mrs. Bauford?

01:39:35.556 --> 01:39:37.270
My name is Jan Steiger.

01:39:37.650 --> 01:39:38.395
I'm a friend of Nick's.

01:39:38.471 --> 01:39:40.773
May I?

01:39:43.727 --> 01:39:45.108
We work together.

01:39:45.184 --> 01:39:46.872
On and off.

01:39:49.059 --> 01:39:51.015
You should move your bed.

01:39:51.169 --> 01:39:52.588
It's too near the window.

01:39:52.664 --> 01:39:54.851
Were you working together here?

01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:57.574
Yes, in a manner of speaking.

01:39:57.651 --> 01:39:58.879
How'd you know where I was?

01:39:59.450 --> 01:40:00.260
My sister?

01:40:00.298 --> 01:40:03.730
Oh, no, I'm not a journalist, Mrs. Bauford.

01:40:03.022 --> 01:40:04.556
I'm more import/export.

01:40:04.632 --> 01:40:07.817
Cambodia, we nearly met.

01:40:09.197 --> 01:40:10.156
Actually,

01:40:10.233 --> 01:40:12.074
Nick mentioned you a few times.

01:40:12.151 --> 01:40:13.878
I most certainly would have.

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:15.182
What do you want?

01:40:15.258 --> 01:40:17.637
What do you want, Mrs. Bauford?

01:40:17.713 --> 01:40:19.018
I want to know where Nick is.

01:40:19.094 --> 01:40:21.260
Last I heard,

01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:22.585
he was being held in the mountains--

01:40:22.662 --> 01:40:23.813
a rebel position,

01:40:23.851 --> 01:40:25.577
about 5, 6 miles northeast of here.

01:40:25.654 --> 01:40:27.610
Whole area's under heavy
Russian shelling now,

01:40:27.687 --> 01:40:29.452
but I managed to make radio contact.

01:40:29.528 --> 01:40:32.350
They were negotiating, they knew who he was.

01:40:34.170 --> 01:40:37.047
But that was yesterday, been nothing since.

01:40:37.085 --> 01:40:40.116
Chances are that he's dead.

01:40:42.187 --> 01:40:43.530
So why are you telling me this?

01:40:43.607 --> 01:40:46.360
I'm curious.

01:40:46.023 --> 01:40:48.823
I mean, you come to this shit-hole in hell,

01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:52.122
and you think you can find him?

01:40:52.199 --> 01:40:54.117
What is it?

01:40:54.194 --> 01:40:55.536
Is this... love?

01:40:55.613 --> 01:40:57.070
Is that what it is?

01:41:00.638 --> 01:41:02.300
Okay, whatever.

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.014
You're here.

01:41:04.090 --> 01:41:05.510
Now...

01:41:05.587 --> 01:41:07.466
if I get him back alive.

01:41:07.504 --> 01:41:09.845
I'll lose one less operative.

01:41:10.110 --> 01:41:13.106
If he's dead, he's dead.

01:41:13.144 --> 01:41:16.366
Of course I'm not stupid enough
to risk my own ass

01:41:16.442 --> 01:41:18.322
for some fucked-up big mouth.

01:41:18.438 --> 01:41:23.079
But you, you're willing
to risk your life for love.

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.334
I'll trade with anything, Mrs. Bauford.

01:41:28.411 --> 01:41:30.214
Anything at all.

01:41:33.014 --> 01:41:34.050
Fine.

01:41:34.127 --> 01:41:37.502
What do I do?

01:41:37.579 --> 01:41:40.470
I have a friend, a local.

01:41:40.034 --> 01:41:42.643
He can get you into the mountains,

01:41:42.719 --> 01:41:45.712
but after that, I'm just a spectator.

01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:51.044
Love.

01:43:07.801 --> 01:43:09.413
I'm looking for Nick Callahan,

01:43:09.489 --> 01:43:11.791
the English doctor.

01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:47.581
Come.

01:43:50.688 --> 01:43:52.529
Five minutes.

01:44:13.129 --> 01:44:14.510
Nick?

01:44:16.888 --> 01:44:18.001
Nick, it's Sarah.

01:44:29.854 --> 01:44:31.120
I'm going to get you out of here.

01:44:31.196 --> 01:44:32.731
We're going to get out of here right now.

01:44:35.723 --> 01:44:37.641
There's a Red Cross camp on the border.

01:44:37.717 --> 01:44:39.022
It's about 4 miles west of here.

01:44:39.099 --> 01:44:40.019
We can walk it.

01:44:41.017 --> 01:44:42.129
Damn it!

01:44:42.206 --> 01:44:43.702
Come on, get up. Get up!

01:44:43.740 --> 01:44:45.190
Nick, get up!

01:45:15.272 --> 01:45:19.453
Nick? Remember?

01:45:19.491 --> 01:45:21.333
Remember I wrote to you?

01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:23.289
And I told you

01:45:23.366 --> 01:45:25.476
you have a daughter.

01:45:25.552 --> 01:45:29.619
Anna. You remember?

01:45:29.695 --> 01:45:32.342
You're a dad.

01:45:32.419 --> 01:45:36.140
And she needs you.

01:45:36.216 --> 01:45:41.664
She needs you to get up
and walk out of here.

01:45:41.702 --> 01:45:43.390
So get up.

01:45:43.466 --> 01:45:45.231
Get up, Nick.

01:46:13.579 --> 01:46:15.191
That was close.

01:46:52.591 --> 01:46:54.164
What?

01:46:54.241 --> 01:46:56.044
We need a lot of money to do...

01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:58.345
It won't be hard to track us.

01:48:47.633 --> 01:48:49.129
I can't make it-- go!
- You can...

01:48:49.168 --> 01:48:50.817
Go, you've got to go. Listen to me.

01:48:50.894 --> 01:48:52.121
Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:48:52.198 --> 01:48:53.272
They're not going to kill me.

01:48:53.349 --> 01:48:55.267
They're not going to kill me.
They need me alive.

01:48:55.343 --> 01:48:56.264
I'm worth money to them.

01:48:56.302 --> 01:48:58.067
If they get you,

01:48:58.144 --> 01:48:59.870
they will rape you, they will kill you.

01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:02.056
Y-You've got to go and get help.

01:49:05.087 --> 01:49:07.235
Okay. Okay.

01:50:05.044 --> 01:50:06.770
Sarah!

01:50:08.879 --> 01:50:11.872
Sarah, go!

01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:14.300
Go! You can make it.

01:50:16.168 --> 01:50:18.239
Go!

01:50:18.316 --> 01:50:19.774
What are you...

01:50:19.850 --> 01:50:21.577
What are you doing?!

01:50:21.653 --> 01:50:23.188
For God's...

01:50:23.264 --> 01:50:27.800
Sarah, please!

01:50:27.024 --> 01:50:28.443
Stay. Stay.

01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:30.629
Go!

01:51:31.775 --> 01:51:35.880
I hope when you're reading this letter,

01:51:35.036 --> 01:51:37.759
that I'm sitting there next to you

01:51:37.836 --> 01:51:40.752
and you're telling me
that I'm stupid for writing it,

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:43.859
and crazy for trying to find you.

01:51:43.897 --> 01:51:46.544
But how could I not?

01:51:46.659 --> 01:51:48.692
It's you.

01:51:48.731 --> 01:51:53.104
All this time, so many years apart...

01:51:53.180 --> 01:51:56.710
I've missed you,

01:51:56.057 --> 01:51:59.893
but I have never been without you.

01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:03.691
I've woken up with you every morning

01:52:03.768 --> 01:52:06.261
and gone to sleep with you every night.

01:52:06.299 --> 01:52:09.700
You have always been with me.

01:52:09.740 --> 01:52:12.245
Your courage, your smile...

01:52:12.322 --> 01:52:15.160
your damn stubbornness.

01:52:15.237 --> 01:52:19.035
There has never been
any distance between us,

01:52:19.111 --> 01:52:21.874
and there never will be.

01:52:23.638 --> 01:52:25.518
I love you, Nick.
