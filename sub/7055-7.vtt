Previously on Fringe.

00:02.266 --> 00:03.408
In the dreams
that you were having,

00:03.575 --> 00:05.721
the ones that I'm in,
did you feel like you knew me?

00:06.148 --> 00:07.424
You're a stranger.
What would I feel?

00:07.724 --> 00:08.807
Clearly,
I'm in the wrong place,

00:09.105 --> 00:10.297
and all the people
that I know and love

00:10.481 --> 00:11.267
are somewhere else.

00:11.380 --> 00:12.848
Now I just gotta figure out
how to get back home.

00:13.332 --> 00:14.034
(Broyles) In the meantime,

00:14.177 --> 00:15.522
I can make it more comfortable
while you're here.

00:15.684 --> 00:16.427
It's deja vu.

00:16.664 --> 00:17.860
I just wanted to
check in with you.

00:18.229 --> 00:19.746
It can be kind of overwhelming.

00:21.295 --> 00:23.310
- I'm not freaked out.
- Good.

00:23.683 --> 00:25.847
So what were these trials
all about, anyway?

00:26.017 --> 00:28.026
Walter and William bell
thought that children

00:28.183 --> 00:30.369
had extrasensory capabilities.

00:30.548 --> 00:32.585
And so they
experimented on kids.

00:32.790 --> 00:34.312
Some of the children
didn't handle

00:34.503 --> 00:35.643
the Cortexiphan
as well as you did.

00:35.911 --> 00:39.274
Some had adverse
reactions... Emotionally.

00:39.485 --> 00:40.556

- Yes.

01:26.440 --> 01:27.974
This is your last refill

01:28.042 --> 01:29.776
so have your doctor call in

01:29.844 --> 01:33.446
a new prescription
for next time.

01:33.513 --> 01:35.081
Yeah.

01:35.149 --> 01:37.216
I was hoping I wouldn't
need these anymore.

01:42.990 --> 01:44.157

This is bizarre.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.201
Well, I just, uh...
I was on my way home,

02:28.268 --> 02:30.536
and I only live a few
blocks from here.

02:30.637 --> 02:32.872
I didn't know that.

02:34.475 --> 02:36.242
So you're just
heading home now?

02:36.310 --> 02:38.477
Well, from a walk.
I had a migraine.

02:38.545 --> 02:40.847
And you know,
fresh air helps. You?

02:40.915 --> 02:43.783
Well, as far as 24-hour
dining goes,

02:43.851 --> 02:45.885
this place is better than most.

02:45.952 --> 02:48.687
In fact, they make
a pretty good cup of coffee

02:48.755 --> 02:50.156

You remember a couple weeks ago
you asked me if I was...

03:07.007 --> 03:09.075
freaked out?

03:13.313 --> 03:16.115
I used to believe
just a few months ago

03:16.183 --> 03:20.286
that, uh, I understood
the world we lived in.

03:20.354 --> 03:24.890
I mean, there were basic truths
that I thought were...

03:24.958 --> 03:28.895
Well... True.

04:16.310 --> 04:17.810

You okay?

04:17.878 --> 04:19.612

to call me that?

06:24.191 --> 06:25.459
Keep that level of formality.

06:25.526 --> 06:27.995

to your prisoner.

he was being followed home.

he was already dead.

the perpetrator.

08:18.071 --> 08:20.373
So he can identify the guy?

08:20.441 --> 08:22.109

that you don't want to risk

what you saw.

he's white as a sheet.

anything for sure.

that that's weird.

we're hearing of it?

13:18.632 --> 13:19.967
Before they ran
the medical records,

13:20.035 --> 13:21.871
the police just assumed
that all the victims

13:21.939 --> 13:24.442
were suffering from albinism.

13:24.510 --> 13:26.347
It's more common
than people think.

13:26.415 --> 13:29.219
I guess.
Any luck?

13:29.288 --> 13:31.258
Well, so far, I've checked
law enforcement databases,

13:31.326 --> 13:32.460
including interpol,

13:32.528 --> 13:34.331
but it's possible
that this person's DNA

13:34.399 --> 13:36.402
is not in any
criminal database.

13:36.470 --> 13:37.572
What about hospitals?

13:37.639 --> 13:39.074
That's my next move.

13:39.143 --> 13:40.778
(Walter) We call them albinos,

13:40.847 --> 13:43.016
but the kishwahili tribe
from Tanzania

13:43.085 --> 13:44.419
called them "zeru."

13:45.163 --> 13:48.469
Which is also the word
for "ghosts."

13:48.537 --> 13:49.987
Witch doctors from there

13:50.573 --> 13:53.645
sometimes used body parts
from albinos

13:53.713 --> 13:55.983
in potions for good luck
or fortune.

13:56.052 --> 13:58.021
- That's...
- Grisly?

13:58.089 --> 14:00.393
Yeah, I'd say that.

14:01.698 --> 14:03.066
You found something?

14:03.134 --> 14:04.468
Yeah.

14:04.537 --> 14:05.972
There's a mucous-like
substance

14:06.040 --> 14:08.043
on the body, a residue.

14:08.112 --> 14:10.148
From something in particular?

14:10.215 --> 14:11.616
Uh-huh.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.856
They're chromatophore cells

14:13.923 --> 14:16.828
you find them
in octopi, chameleons.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.565
Cells that have the ability

14:18.633 --> 14:21.439
to translocate
pigment in the body.

14:21.506 --> 14:23.075
It's what certain creatures use

14:23.144 --> 14:25.948
to blend into
their backgrounds.

14:26.016 --> 14:27.517
I just got a positive I.D.
On the blood sample.

14:27.586 --> 14:28.954
Do we have a name?

14:29.023 --> 14:31.727
Uh-huh.
Baby boy Bryant.

14:31.796 --> 14:33.230
According to this,
the blood sample

14:33.299 --> 14:35.068
we found at the crime scene
belonged to a baby

14:35.136 --> 14:37.239
born on July 26, 1989,

14:37.307 --> 14:39.042
at parkview hospital
in New York.

14:39.580 --> 14:41.282
And he died four days later...

14:41.350 --> 14:43.085
July 30, 1989.

14:43.153 --> 14:45.925
(Walter) Well, that's
quite a quandary.

14:45.994 --> 14:48.999
Perhaps we're looking
for a ghost after all.

14:55.928 --> 14:57.729
(Lincoln) They started automating
their records 20 years ago.

14:58.634 --> 14:59.567
Here it is.

14:59.635 --> 15:01.436
"Baby boy Bryant.

15:01.503 --> 15:04.171
Born 26 July, 1989."

15:04.239 --> 15:06.007
Gosh, they didn't even
give him a proper name.

15:06.074 --> 15:08.910
Infant born with
an unclassified genetic variant.

15:08.977 --> 15:11.178
Over ten specialists
examined him.

15:11.246 --> 15:13.147
No one could diagnose him.

15:13.215 --> 15:16.016
No medical precedent found.

15:16.084 --> 15:17.251
You okay?

15:17.319 --> 15:19.153
Yeah, I just started
to get another migraine.

15:20.923 --> 15:21.922
I can do it.

15:21.990 --> 15:25.827
I know you can, but
you don't need to.

15:25.894 --> 15:26.827
Thanks.

15:26.895 --> 15:28.996
I'll get you some water.

15:29.064 --> 15:30.698
So this baby was a mystery.

15:30.766 --> 15:32.600
Says he died from complications

15:32.668 --> 15:34.168
of his genetic abnormality

15:34.236 --> 15:36.538
on the 30th of July, 1989.

15:36.605 --> 15:38.505
Which we already knew.

15:40.208 --> 15:42.343
Thank you.

15:42.411 --> 15:45.213
Okay, Dr. Blake West

15:45.281 --> 15:47.214
and Teresa Jaffee, RN.

15:47.282 --> 15:48.616
See, I wonder if either of them

15:48.684 --> 15:49.884
are still working here.

15:49.952 --> 15:51.819
(Lincoln)
Ms. Jaffee,

15:51.887 --> 15:53.921
is this your signature
on the death certificate?

15:53.989 --> 15:55.423
(Jaffee) Yes.

15:55.491 --> 15:56.691
(Olivia) Can you tell
us what you remember

15:56.758 --> 15:58.459
about baby boy Bryant?

15:58.527 --> 16:02.129
I was in the delivery room
when he was born.

16:02.197 --> 16:05.165
He was so... Pale.

16:05.233 --> 16:07.234
When Dr. West
held him up,

16:07.302 --> 16:10.070
the lights in the O.R.
burned his skin.

16:10.138 --> 16:11.906
We had to put him
in a special ward

16:11.974 --> 16:15.476
with no windows and no lights.

16:15.544 --> 16:18.479
So when Dr. West told me
that the baby had died,

16:18.547 --> 16:21.549
I was relieved that he
wasn't suffering anymore.

16:27.690 --> 16:28.623
What is it?

16:28.690 --> 16:31.025
I've never told anyone this.

16:31.092 --> 16:35.696
As they carried him out...

16:35.764 --> 16:37.331
I thought I heard him cry.

16:37.399 --> 16:40.201
It was faint.

16:40.268 --> 16:43.204
But I thought I heard him.

16:43.271 --> 16:45.773
I assumed I had imagined it.

16:45.841 --> 16:48.409
Do you remember
where he was taken to?

16:48.477 --> 16:51.279
It was a private
insurance company.

16:51.380 --> 16:56.050
Um, something like...
Cilas or...

16:56.117 --> 16:59.687
Cyrpo, uh... Cyprox?

16:59.755 --> 17:01.889
Yes. That's it.

17:01.957 --> 17:04.224
Cyrpox, incorporated.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.060
I was told they'd be handling

17:06.127 --> 17:07.829
the autopsy.

17:07.896 --> 17:09.530
Thank you so much
for your help.

17:12.601 --> 17:14.535
Okay.

17:14.602 --> 17:16.237
How'd you know Cyprox?

17:16.304 --> 17:18.138
Because they paid
my mother's medical bills

17:18.205 --> 17:19.773
while she was dying of cancer.

17:19.842 --> 17:21.675
And Cyprox was a subsidiary

17:21.743 --> 17:24.178
or a larger company
called Kelvin Genetics.

17:24.246 --> 17:25.646
Why do I have
a bad feeling about this?

17:25.714 --> 17:28.883
Because Kelvin Genetics
became massive dynamic.

17:28.984 --> 17:31.786
"Cyprox, Inc."

17:31.854 --> 17:33.421
It's been years
since I heard that name.

17:33.489 --> 17:34.489
We have reason to believe

17:34.556 --> 17:36.824
that Cyprox, Inc.
abducted an infant

17:36.892 --> 17:38.392
from a hospital 22 years ago.

17:38.460 --> 17:40.995
I'm afraid
your suspicions are true.

17:41.063 --> 17:43.230
What can you tell us about him?

17:43.298 --> 17:46.233
The boy had an unidentified
genetic abnormality.

17:46.301 --> 17:47.868
He would have died
within a matter of days.

17:47.936 --> 17:50.004
But this same genetic deformity

17:50.072 --> 17:52.172
made him suitable for some...

17:52.240 --> 17:54.375
Genetic experimentation.

17:56.377 --> 17:58.713
Walter discovered
specific animal cells

17:58.780 --> 17:59.747
on the body that we found.

17:59.815 --> 18:01.549
Chromatophores.

18:01.617 --> 18:04.318
The nature of the boy's
cellular abnormality

18:04.386 --> 18:07.221
allowed those cells to be
implanted into his system,

18:07.289 --> 18:09.824
making him able to blend
into his surroundings.

18:09.892 --> 18:12.660
Making him a perfect
spy or soldier.

18:12.728 --> 18:14.695
Well, there were
military applications, yes.

18:14.763 --> 18:17.331
Unexpectedly, the experiment

18:17.398 --> 18:19.233
also allowed
this child to survive.

18:19.301 --> 18:21.168
Something about
the chromatophores

18:21.236 --> 18:23.470
offset his very fragile
condition.

18:23.538 --> 18:25.873
And you knew about this?

18:25.941 --> 18:27.642
No.

18:27.710 --> 18:29.777
This was a satellite
research facility,

18:29.845 --> 18:30.945
one of dozens.

18:31.012 --> 18:33.815
Neither Dr. bell nor I
had any specific knowledge

18:33.882 --> 18:35.082
of what was going on.

18:35.150 --> 18:37.418
Now, I'm not trying
to justify what was done.

18:37.485 --> 18:39.454
I'm just saying
that this child would have died

18:39.521 --> 18:41.088
had he not been
part of that program.

18:41.156 --> 18:43.090
Maybe that would have
been better.

18:48.196 --> 18:51.298
I think I'll send the boy's
files over to Walter's lab,

18:51.367 --> 18:53.200
maybe there's something
in them that can help.

18:53.268 --> 18:55.803
If you didn't know about him,

18:55.871 --> 18:57.872
how are you so
familiar with all this?

18:57.940 --> 19:00.074
There was a fire in the lab
ten years ago.

19:00.142 --> 19:02.043
And we assumed
that all the subjects

19:02.110 --> 19:03.911
had died in that fire.

19:03.979 --> 19:05.579
That was the first time
that William and I

19:05.680 --> 19:06.914
ever learned of Eugene.

19:08.316 --> 19:09.450
Eugene?

19:09.518 --> 19:11.118
Well, that's what
the researchers called him.

19:11.186 --> 19:12.219
"U-gene."

19:12.287 --> 19:14.621
Short for
"unknown genetic disorder."

19:14.689 --> 19:17.892
His entire life,
he didn't have a proper name.

19:20.195 --> 19:22.429
We assumed that he'd died.

19:22.497 --> 19:26.233
And, as you can imagine,
it was impossible to prove.

19:26.301 --> 19:27.268
So...

19:27.335 --> 19:29.970
Now it seems
as if we were wrong.

think that Eugene

24:21.206 --> 24:23.607
is trying to make himself
visible?

24:23.675 --> 24:25.443
That he's killing people

24:25.510 --> 24:27.078
in order to steal
their pigment?

24:27.145 --> 24:29.981
Is that even possible?

24:30.048 --> 24:31.982
It's possible, of course.

24:32.050 --> 24:33.784
Leprechauns are possible.

[Chuckling]

25:41.653 --> 25:44.722
I have two pieces of news.

25:44.789 --> 25:46.590
First, he's dying.

25:46.658 --> 25:48.492
Who's dying, Walter?

25:48.560 --> 25:50.594
Our suspect.

25:50.695 --> 25:51.695
The chameleon man.

25:51.763 --> 25:54.065
[Chuckling]

25:54.132 --> 25:56.433
I've spent the last few hours

25:56.501 --> 25:58.335
recreating what we believe

25:58.403 --> 26:00.771
our young man
is doing to himself, and,

26:00.838 --> 26:02.172
assuming you're right, Olivia,

26:02.240 --> 26:06.277
and he's trying to
re-pigmentize himself, then...

26:06.345 --> 26:08.512
Is that a word,
"re-pigmentize"?

26:08.580 --> 26:09.846
Well, go on, Walter.

26:09.914 --> 26:11.348
What is he trying
to do to himself?

26:11.416 --> 26:14.284
Well, the condition he was
born with was killing him.

26:14.352 --> 26:17.053
If he is now attempting to
reverse what was done to him,

26:17.121 --> 26:19.256
to make himself normal...

26:19.324 --> 26:21.058
Or what was normal to him...

26:21.126 --> 26:22.959
Then he is, in fact,
committing suicide.

26:23.027 --> 26:24.728
So you're saying

26:24.796 --> 26:26.129
he's poisoning himself?

26:26.197 --> 26:27.531
In a sense, yes.

26:27.599 --> 26:29.700
His body's reverting
to the deadly condition

26:29.768 --> 26:32.469
that he came
into the world with.

[Chuckles]

26:33.638 --> 26:36.273
Although...
He may not be aware of it.

26:36.341 --> 26:38.175
Well, how long until he dies?

26:38.276 --> 26:39.710
Oh, don't worry.

26:39.811 --> 26:41.311
John here will be fine.

Olivia meant the mouse.

26:47.118 --> 26:48.885
Well, I can't say.

26:48.953 --> 26:52.223
I suppose it depends
on how successful he is.

26:53.625 --> 26:55.726
Okay, well, that
doesn't change anything.

find something we can't see?

there the whole time?

27:29.694 --> 27:30.827
I was just starting my shift

27:30.895 --> 27:32.529
when I saw the body.

27:32.597 --> 27:34.798
I didn't know what it was
at first, all pale and white.

27:34.866 --> 27:37.167
It took me a while
to see it was Mr. ryerson.

27:37.235 --> 27:39.437
Are the surveillance
cameras functional?

27:39.504 --> 27:41.404
Yeah, just installed
a few weeks ago.

27:41.473 --> 27:43.307
There's been
some break-ins recently.

27:43.375 --> 27:45.576
And you say that
nobody left the building?

27:45.644 --> 27:47.811
There's an emergency alarm
on the back door,

27:47.879 --> 27:49.346
and you were at the front door
the whole time?

27:49.414 --> 27:51.482
You never walked away,
not even to go to the bathroom?

27:51.550 --> 27:53.650
No, and I watched
the security footage again,

27:53.718 --> 27:54.785
just to make certain.

27:54.852 --> 27:56.987
This is going to sound odd.

27:57.055 --> 27:59.222
Even though you didn't
see anyone,

27:59.290 --> 28:02.158
did any of the exterior

still be up there.

Yep... Just finished.

40:08.515 --> 40:10.249
Thank you.

40:10.317 --> 40:11.850
Guess we can put
this case on the list

40:11.919 --> 40:14.353
of things that makes it
hard for you to sleep.

40:14.421 --> 40:17.190
That list is getting longer.

40:21.996 --> 40:24.030
Well, maybe if you
find yourself, uh,

40:24.097 --> 40:25.498
at the diner tonight,

40:25.565 --> 40:26.933
say, around 3:00 A.M.,

40:27.000 --> 40:29.135
I might, uh,
I might see you there.

40:30.437 --> 40:33.005
I'll see you then.

40:33.073 --> 40:35.041
Maybe.

41:57.891 --> 41:59.525
[Door unlatches]

42:01.829 --> 42:03.763
[Device beeping] Clear.

42:22.349 --> 42:23.449
Should we move her to the bed?

42:23.516 --> 42:24.651
No need.

42:24.718 --> 42:25.818
She's not gonna remember

42:25.886 --> 42:27.019
the last two hours, anyway.

42:27.087 --> 42:28.320
When she wakes up,

42:28.388 --> 42:29.988
she's gonna have
one hell of a headache.
