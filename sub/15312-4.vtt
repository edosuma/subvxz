38:29.478 --> 38:32.711
AND YOU'RE OKAY WITH THIS?

38:32.711 --> 38:34.483
IT'S COMPLICATED.

38:34.483 --> 38:36.014
NOT TO ME.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.446
YOU KEPT US OUT OF A WAR,
LILLIAN.

38:37.446 --> 38:38.787
WE'RE ALL APPRECIATIVE
OF THAT.

38:38.787 --> 38:39.948
SPARE ME.

38:39.948 --> 38:42.851
I READ
YOUR AFTER-ACTION REPORT.

38:42.851 --> 38:44.623
YOUR TEAM WAS IMPRESSIVE.

38:44.623 --> 38:47.796
THAT REPORT
IS CLASSIFIED.

38:47.796 --> 38:50.459
I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CIA.
I'M CLEARED.

38:50.459 --> 38:52.030
NOT FOR THIS, YOU'RE NOT.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.363
WE'VE DECIDED TO BRING JEFF IN
ON THIS.

38:54.363 --> 38:56.835
YOU'VE DECIDED?
AND WHO'S WE?

38:56.835 --> 38:59.808
THE PRESIDENT.

39:04.573 --> 39:05.974
WHY?

39:05.974 --> 39:08.577
CHECKS AND BALANCES.

39:08.577 --> 39:09.878
WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN?

39:09.878 --> 39:11.450
I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE

39:11.450 --> 39:13.922
THAT THE ASSET DIVERTED
FROM THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE.

39:13.922 --> 39:16.455
OH, YOU'VE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

39:19.828 --> 39:21.930
YES, JEFF, HE DIVERTED,

39:21.930 --> 39:24.433
AND, AS A RESULT,
YOUR AGENT WAS LIBERATED.

39:24.433 --> 39:26.865
I WOULD THINK THE CHIP
WOULD MAKE HIM MORE PREDICTABLE.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.967
HE IMPROVISED.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.699
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
WE CHOSE GABRIEL.

39:30.699 --> 39:35.504
HE'S A HUMAN BEING.
UNLIKE EMILY TYNER, APPARENTLY.

39:35.504 --> 39:38.407
THERE'S A THIN LINE
BETWEEN IMPROVISATION

39:38.407 --> 39:40.409
AND INSUBORDINATION.

39:40.409 --> 39:43.552
WAIT A MINUTE.

39:43.552 --> 39:44.953
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

39:44.953 --> 39:48.757
CHECKS AND BALANCES.

39:48.757 --> 39:51.860
THE PRESIDENT IS CONCERNED
ABOUT THE DAY

39:51.860 --> 39:55.564
WHEN WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO CONTROL GABRIEL AT ALL.
