WEBVTT

00:00.195 --> 00:01.546
With winds coming
from the Gulf,

00:01.625 --> 00:04.293
the storm is moving quickly
but in a predictable pattern.

00:04.391 --> 00:07.870
The hurricane should reach Miami
by tomorrow night.

00:07.971 --> 00:08.852
Oh, no!

00:09.135 --> 00:10.836
This storm sounds pretty bad.

00:10.837 --> 00:11.971
Should we be worried?

00:11.973 --> 00:13.005
Roxie, we'll be fine.

00:13.006 --> 00:14.772
Hurricanes hit Miami
all the time.

00:14.775 --> 00:16.007
Yeah, you can always tell

00:16.010 --> 00:17.876
how bad they're gonna be based
on their names.

00:17.879 --> 00:20.612
Hurricane Isabel was one of
the most destructive on record.

00:20.614 --> 00:22.547
Yeah, and this one's named
Chloe, so it should be a cute,

00:22.550 --> 00:23.548
little storm.

00:23.550 --> 00:24.649
<i>I am now getting a--</i>

00:24.652 --> 00:26.050
Okay, don't shoot
the messenger,

00:26.053 --> 00:27.820
but these are your costumes
for tomorrow's

00:27.821 --> 00:29.722
deserted island scene.

00:29.724 --> 00:32.323
And since we have to be
practically naked on camera

00:32.326 --> 00:35.360
tomorrow, I'm banning all food
from set for the next 24 hours

00:35.362 --> 00:36.695
starting in two minutes.

00:36.697 --> 00:38.296
- What? No!
- Are you kidding?

00:38.298 --> 00:39.965
Hey, hey, hey,
we don't want a repeat

00:39.966 --> 00:41.533
of when we shot
the day after Thanksgiving.

00:44.438 --> 00:46.371
I ate an entire pecan pie.

00:46.374 --> 00:48.374
Ugh, I pe-can't even.

00:48.375 --> 00:51.442
One minute and 45 seconds
before all the food disappears.

00:51.445 --> 00:53.012
Dios mio, she's serious.

00:53.014 --> 00:54.380
To the food, vamonos!

01:00.121 --> 01:02.153
I'm so glad I'm not an actor.

01:02.155 --> 01:03.988
Oh, you're not gonna
get to eat either, Isaac.

01:03.990 --> 01:05.957
What? Why do us less beautiful
have to suffer?

01:05.959 --> 01:07.225
You wrote it.

01:07.227 --> 01:08.260
Here we go, five more seconds.

01:08.262 --> 01:11.096
Five, four, three,

01:11.097 --> 01:14.432
two, food down!

01:14.435 --> 01:15.567
Ha ha!

01:15.569 --> 01:17.436
See?
This is how we stay sexy.

01:34.801 --> 01:36.344
_

01:44.265 --> 01:46.131
All right,
crying's not happening.

01:46.133 --> 01:48.000
- We'll put the tears in post.
- Cut!

01:48.002 --> 01:50.069
Oh, great job, you guys.

01:50.070 --> 01:54.105
We fasted for 24 hours
and we look amazing.

01:54.108 --> 01:56.741
Now let's get out of these
clothes, our makeup off,

01:56.743 --> 01:58.743
and eat like people
who aren't on camera.

01:58.746 --> 02:03.983
Just for the record,
I can cry on cue.

02:04.986 --> 02:06.451
Am I doing it?

02:06.453 --> 02:09.621
No, but your desperation
is so sad, Roxie's crying.

02:11.324 --> 02:13.625
He's trying so hard, you know?

02:17.764 --> 02:18.764
Um-- whoa.

02:18.765 --> 02:19.998
- Excuse me.
- Props.

02:20.001 --> 02:21.432
- I'll take that.
- Whoa.

02:21.435 --> 02:23.102
- Coming through.
- Crew sure wants to leave.

02:23.103 --> 02:24.770
They're taking this hurricane
pretty seriously.

02:24.771 --> 02:26.170
It's not the hurricane.

02:26.173 --> 02:28.039
They always leave the second
they're done with work.

02:28.042 --> 02:31.210
Are we that difficult
to be around?

02:31.211 --> 02:33.145
- Nah.
- Oh.

02:33.146 --> 02:34.780
We're amazing.

02:34.781 --> 02:37.081
If it does turn into something
more serious, don't worry.

02:37.084 --> 02:39.617
I'm your Set Safety Captain.

02:39.620 --> 02:42.521
I should go reread the hurricane
chapter in my safety manual.

02:42.522 --> 02:45.691
The info will blow you away.

02:45.692 --> 02:47.593
See?
Safety can be fun.

02:52.566 --> 02:55.366
- Gael is our Safety Captain?
- Yeah. What's the problem?

02:55.368 --> 02:57.836
The guy got so nervous
during our CPR seminar,

02:57.837 --> 03:00.605
he started hyperventilating
and needed CPR.

03:00.608 --> 03:03.141
Which was great practice
for the rest of us.

03:03.144 --> 03:04.742
Look, he's very qualified.

03:04.745 --> 03:06.677
He was an Eagle Scout,
plus he went through

03:06.680 --> 03:09.414
the most grueling
survival training of all--

03:09.417 --> 03:12.217
greeter orientation
at Abercrombie & Fitch.

03:12.218 --> 03:13.519
If you say so.

03:13.521 --> 03:15.586
Trust me,
he's the best guy for the job.

03:15.588 --> 03:17.389
Let me guess, you couldn't get
anyone else to do it.

03:17.390 --> 03:19.490
No, training
was seven Saturdays in a row.

03:19.492 --> 03:20.491
I ain't got time for that.

03:20.493 --> 03:22.326
At least this is
sort of a real thing.

03:22.329 --> 03:24.430
Last week you made him
president of lunch.

03:24.431 --> 03:26.564
I like making Gael
feel important.

03:26.567 --> 03:28.266
He's like a little brother
to me.

03:28.269 --> 03:29.768
I mean, a little brother
I'd like to sleep with

03:29.770 --> 03:31.870
if he wasn't gay, but...

03:31.872 --> 03:33.504
Yeah, that felt weird
as I said it.

03:33.507 --> 03:36.875
Look, don't tell Gael he made
Safety Captain by default.

03:36.877 --> 03:38.444
He's very sensitive.

03:38.445 --> 03:39.812
You know how actors are.

03:39.813 --> 03:41.212
They freak out if you
tell them the truth.

03:41.215 --> 03:42.914
- Your lipstick's crooked.
- What?

03:42.917 --> 03:47.352
I told Ila-- Oh,
testing the theory, good one.

03:47.353 --> 03:48.719
But seriously, is it crooked?

03:52.725 --> 03:53.991
What?

03:53.993 --> 03:55.627
Rodrigo, did I give you
the wrong-size trunks?

03:55.628 --> 03:57.128
No, these fit this morning.

03:57.131 --> 03:58.663
I have a really fast metabolism.

03:58.665 --> 04:00.331
Since Ana banned all food
on set,

04:00.334 --> 04:01.699
I'm already down two pounds.

04:01.701 --> 04:03.001
- See?
- Oh, I know.

04:03.002 --> 04:05.471
All this starving myself
is making me hungry.

04:05.473 --> 04:07.840
When I get home, I'm gonna
eat my weight in fish sticks.

04:07.842 --> 04:09.140
I'm still not used
to your hair like that.

04:09.143 --> 04:10.641
Ah, well, the kids
are at their abuela's,

04:10.644 --> 04:12.743
so Mami got a blowout.

04:12.746 --> 04:15.848
Mami? I've been calling her
Mimi this whole time.

04:15.849 --> 04:17.615
Ah, don't worry.
The second my hair gets wet,

04:17.617 --> 04:18.783
the curls come right back,

04:18.786 --> 04:20.384
but in five days
when it's still straight,

04:20.387 --> 04:21.653
doesn't mean I didn't shower.

04:21.654 --> 04:22.754
I just use a shower cap

04:22.755 --> 04:23.956
and this hose thingy,
and you know what?

04:23.957 --> 04:25.389
I don't need
to defend myself to you people.

04:28.562 --> 04:30.362
Oh, oh, sorry.

04:30.363 --> 04:32.197
Oh, gosh, we are stuck.

04:32.199 --> 04:33.764
How do you like that?

04:33.766 --> 04:36.134
I guess I would have
to take my robe off,

04:36.137 --> 04:37.636
and then your shirt
would have to come off too.

04:37.637 --> 04:38.769
We'd be naked together.

04:38.771 --> 04:40.172
That'd be crazy.

04:40.173 --> 04:42.074
Is that gonna happen?

04:42.076 --> 04:43.908
Guess not.
See you later.

04:43.911 --> 04:45.610
Okay.

04:45.612 --> 04:47.278
I was just kidding
about that naked thing.

04:48.848 --> 04:50.949
Well, somebody's got a crush.

04:50.951 --> 04:54.452
What? No.
Is it that obvious?

04:54.454 --> 04:56.355
Have I been voted
sexiest bald man in Miami

04:56.356 --> 04:58.322
three years in a row?

04:58.324 --> 05:00.291
Yes, I have,
and yes, it's obvious.

05:00.293 --> 05:01.692
It's stupid.

05:01.694 --> 05:03.194
It's not like I have a chance
with her, right?

05:03.197 --> 05:05.963
I'm a religious man,
and I believe in miracles,

05:05.966 --> 05:08.300
but no.

05:12.005 --> 05:13.605
Gael, what are you wearing?

05:13.606 --> 05:15.940
Oh, it's never too early
to be prepared,

05:15.942 --> 05:17.475
so I've got my safety sash,

05:17.478 --> 05:18.610
my safety badge,

05:18.612 --> 05:20.045
- and my whistle.
- Oh.

05:20.047 --> 05:23.214
Fun fact, one of my first jobs
was whistle model.

05:26.420 --> 05:27.920
Oh, he's good.

05:27.922 --> 05:29.588
What's with the cones?

05:29.589 --> 05:31.956
In the safety classes, they'd
always say, "Put out the cones."

05:31.959 --> 05:33.457
They didn't say
what to do with them,

05:33.459 --> 05:36.127
so I figured I would use them
to point out the exit.

05:36.129 --> 05:37.329
- Oh.
- Yeah, okay.

05:37.331 --> 05:38.829
but they're kind of blocking
the exit,

05:38.831 --> 05:40.632
- so I don't-- That's so--
- You are killing this.

05:40.634 --> 05:42.834
- You're killing it.
- Responsible, organized,

05:42.836 --> 05:44.836
and one of the few people
who can pull off orange.

05:44.838 --> 05:46.204
You are headed home, right?

05:46.206 --> 05:47.673
A good Safety Captain

05:47.675 --> 05:49.774
never leaves until everyone
is safely out.

05:49.776 --> 05:51.242
- Hmm.
- Hmm, that's true.

05:51.245 --> 05:54.045
Thanks again, Ana,
for making me Safety Captain.

05:54.048 --> 05:56.380
It really means a lot to me.

05:56.382 --> 05:57.516
I need more cones.

05:57.518 --> 05:59.451
Okay, yes.

05:59.452 --> 06:00.952
Okay.

06:00.954 --> 06:02.987
You see how happy I made him?

06:02.990 --> 06:04.288
He is walking on sunshine.

06:04.290 --> 06:06.490
Which is ironic
given the circumstances.

06:06.492 --> 06:08.326
Oh, what's the harm in letting
him have a little fun?

06:08.329 --> 06:10.362
It's not like
it's a real natural disaster.

06:10.363 --> 06:12.898
- It's little Chloe.
- You're right.

06:12.899 --> 06:14.432
Oh.

06:19.439 --> 06:21.540
Wow, everyone
really left quickly.

06:21.542 --> 06:23.408
Even Conception in reception.

06:23.410 --> 06:24.910
Yeah, she said something
about getting home

06:24.911 --> 06:27.112
before the big storm and a story
about her niece, which,

06:27.113 --> 06:28.913
frankly, I did not listen to.

06:28.915 --> 06:31.016
Why is everyone
overreacting about the storm?

06:31.018 --> 06:33.050
Yeah, I'm sure
it's not that bad.

06:40.194 --> 06:41.543
Oh, it's bad.

06:43.096 --> 06:46.465
Oh, ah, where did he
get all these cones?

06:46.466 --> 06:48.899
- What happened to your hair?
- That.

06:48.901 --> 06:52.204
<i>Hurricane Chloe is here,
and it's really bad.</i>

06:52.206 --> 06:54.206
<i>The mayor has closed all roads,</i>

06:54.207 --> 06:56.375
<i>and everyone must stay adentro,
okay?</i>

06:56.377 --> 06:58.343
<i>Not outdoors, indoors.</i>

06:58.345 --> 07:00.478
<i>Like, don't even think about
leaving, oyeron?</i>

07:00.480 --> 07:02.180
Seriously?
We can't leave?

07:02.182 --> 07:04.815
Why didn't they
give us any warning?

07:04.817 --> 07:06.418
But we're all starving.

07:06.420 --> 07:07.418
And there's no food.

07:07.420 --> 07:09.321
What are we gonna do?

07:09.322 --> 07:13.824
Don't worry, everyone,
I'm the Safety Captain.

07:13.826 --> 07:15.761
You know what?
We're gonna be fine.

07:15.762 --> 07:18.096
I mean, how bad can it be?

07:20.800 --> 07:22.834
Be careful.
There are cones everywhere.

07:28.757 --> 07:30.692
As your Set Safety Captain,

07:30.694 --> 07:32.827
I think we should focus
on what the safety manual

07:32.829 --> 07:35.596
blankets, batteries,

07:35.598 --> 07:36.865
and the buddy system.

07:36.867 --> 07:38.600
So everyone pair up
with a friend and--

07:38.601 --> 07:41.769
Uh, what if you aren't buddies
with anyone here?

07:41.771 --> 07:43.437
And why do we need blankets?

07:43.439 --> 07:44.805
The power's out,
so there's no AC.

07:44.807 --> 07:47.175
It's gonna be, like,
100 degrees in here.

07:47.177 --> 07:49.276
Even our hot Latino blood
can't handle that.

07:49.278 --> 07:52.646
According to the manual,
blankets are important.

07:52.649 --> 07:54.281
Yup, it says right here,

07:54.283 --> 07:56.384
"Blankets are important."
Confirmed.

07:56.387 --> 07:59.454
Okay. All right, Gael,
I will take it from here.

07:59.456 --> 08:01.757
All right, you guys,
looks like Hurricane Chloe

08:01.759 --> 08:03.492
wasn't as harmless
as we thought.

08:03.494 --> 08:05.660
Being totally honest,
Chloe's kind of a bitch,

08:05.661 --> 08:06.995
kind of like a Chrissy
or a Jessica.

08:08.499 --> 08:11.199
Luckily, we have these torches
left over from that episode

08:11.201 --> 08:13.100
where the angry mob
burned down the torch factory.

08:13.103 --> 08:14.502
Yeah, but there's still
no food.

08:14.504 --> 08:17.939
Yeah, and I'm wasting away.
This booty, gone.

08:17.940 --> 08:20.942
I'm fine. I've been on a diet
for the past 40 years.

08:20.944 --> 08:23.110
Isaac, you live here.
Don't you have any food?

08:23.112 --> 08:25.012
I survive
on your leftover gift baskets,

08:25.014 --> 08:27.249
but now that we're past award
season, that well has dried up.

08:29.086 --> 08:30.285
Okay, all right, all right,

08:30.286 --> 08:32.520
let's just all go look
for food, anything.

08:32.523 --> 08:34.121
Well, uh-uh!
No trans fats.

08:34.124 --> 08:36.057
We're not that desperate.

08:36.058 --> 08:38.527
Move it, man-scarf.

08:38.528 --> 08:40.095
Okay, you need
to find food fast.

08:40.096 --> 08:41.797
When you get hungry,
you lose your filter.

08:41.798 --> 08:44.032
Remember when you did
that juice cleanse last year?

08:44.033 --> 08:45.834
And you're a ***, okay?

08:45.836 --> 08:47.936
Keep your *** feet
off the *** table

08:47.937 --> 08:50.572
and keep my *** name
out of your *** mouths!

08:51.707 --> 08:54.842
Well, in my defense,
I was so *** hungry.

08:56.846 --> 08:58.947
Hey, Isabela,
what are you doing?

08:58.948 --> 09:00.548
If I'm stuck here
with you animals,

09:00.551 --> 09:02.082
I need to reapply my makeup.

09:02.085 --> 09:04.452
- But it's so dark in here.
- I know.

09:04.455 --> 09:05.720
I can't see what I'm doing.

09:05.721 --> 09:09.224
How does it look?

09:10.226 --> 09:13.360
It's looking good.

09:13.363 --> 09:14.929
Can I get your help
with something?

09:14.932 --> 09:16.965
No, I hate to help people.

09:16.966 --> 09:20.268
I just-- I need to learn
how to cry on cue.

09:20.269 --> 09:22.671
I do like
to make people cry.

09:22.673 --> 09:24.272
The only reason
you're on this show

09:24.274 --> 09:26.374
is because you were married
to the star,

09:26.375 --> 09:27.676
but one day your looks
will fade,

09:27.677 --> 09:30.144
and all you'll have left
is your horrible music.

09:30.147 --> 09:31.480
I'm sorry you feel that way.

09:31.481 --> 09:32.947
So when do we start?

09:32.950 --> 09:35.216
Ugh!

09:35.219 --> 09:38.452
Well, this hurricane
looks like a doozy.

09:38.455 --> 09:40.754
Guys, if I don't make it,
it's been an honor knowing you.

09:40.756 --> 09:43.057
Oh, please,
don't be so dramatic.

09:43.059 --> 09:44.493
It's not like
you have a splinter.

09:44.495 --> 09:47.229
Those things can travel through
your veins and into your heart.

09:47.230 --> 09:48.562
Let's be honest.

09:48.565 --> 09:51.099
If things go south,
I'm the first one to go.

09:51.100 --> 09:54.201
I have no upper-body strength,
little hand-eye coordination,

09:54.203 --> 09:56.171
and if we're laying our cards
on the table, my will to live

09:56.173 --> 09:57.505
is pretty much nonexistent.

09:57.508 --> 09:59.673
Tough to argue
with any of that.

09:59.676 --> 10:02.510
You know,
once you accept your fate,

10:02.513 --> 10:04.245
it's actually kind of freeing.

10:04.248 --> 10:07.315
Toothpaste?
Done with it, never liked it.

10:07.317 --> 10:09.384
What if this hurricane
gets worse?

10:09.385 --> 10:11.253
I don't want to die
with any regrets.

10:11.254 --> 10:13.020
I don't have any regrets.

10:13.023 --> 10:15.090
I finished my bucket list
when I was 23.

10:15.091 --> 10:17.359
Turns out it's easier than you
think to get on "Family Feud."

10:17.360 --> 10:19.059
Oh, come on.

10:19.062 --> 10:20.895
There must be something
you've always wanted to do.

10:20.898 --> 10:23.831
This could be your last chance.

10:23.833 --> 10:26.534
Streaking is fun!

10:26.537 --> 10:28.836
Woo-hoo-hoo!
Whoopie!

10:28.838 --> 10:30.871
How does a cameraman
get a nickname like Fat Eddie

10:30.874 --> 10:32.807
if he doesn't have a secret
stash of food laying around?

10:32.808 --> 10:34.209
Ana, I think there's
a generator located--

10:34.211 --> 10:35.943
I got 100 people
starving back there.

10:35.946 --> 10:37.177
Eight, your math is off.

10:37.179 --> 10:38.812
Without AC,
it's only gonna get hotter.

10:38.815 --> 10:40.282
Well, excuse me
for being dramatic

10:40.283 --> 10:41.816
during a natural disaster.

10:41.817 --> 10:43.051
Ana,
I think we really need to--

10:43.052 --> 10:44.686
Oh, my God, Gael,
are you still talking?

10:44.687 --> 10:46.153
You're getting real yippy.

10:46.155 --> 10:48.456
Yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip,
yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip!

10:48.457 --> 10:50.125
Okay, okay, I think we're
all a little hot and hungry--

10:50.126 --> 10:51.759
Look, I'm the one
who knows how to get us

10:51.761 --> 10:52.860
through this storm.

10:52.863 --> 10:54.395
I went to the training sessions,

10:54.398 --> 10:57.032
and I'm the only one who knows
where they keep all the cones.

10:57.033 --> 10:59.366
Gael, the only reason
you're Safety Captain

10:59.369 --> 11:02.102
is because no one else wanted
to be.

11:02.105 --> 11:04.806
Well, I'm still the one
with the badge.

11:09.046 --> 11:11.346
Is his shirt weak,
or is my arm very, very strong?

11:16.972 --> 11:18.874
I need to apologize to Gael,

11:18.875 --> 11:21.076
but until I eat, I'm not
speaking to another human being.

11:21.077 --> 11:22.811
My filter's totally gone.

11:22.812 --> 11:23.879
Oh, yeah?

11:23.880 --> 11:25.713
What do you really think
about my kids?

11:25.716 --> 11:27.014
- Don't make me answer that.
- What do you think?

11:27.017 --> 11:28.682
- Don't make me answer that.
- What do you think?

11:28.684 --> 11:29.683
I'm not sure
I like the middle one.

11:29.686 --> 11:32.019
Hmm.
He grows on you.

11:32.022 --> 11:33.955
Oh, maybe I should have
listened to Gael.

11:33.956 --> 11:36.057
I mean, he had some good ideas.

11:36.058 --> 11:38.994
Maybe we shouldn't be
wasting time looking for food.

11:38.995 --> 11:41.696
Maybe I don't know everything.

11:43.366 --> 11:44.832
I found food!

11:44.835 --> 11:47.869
I do know everything!

11:47.870 --> 11:49.937
Oh!

11:49.940 --> 11:51.539
Did you really find food?

11:51.542 --> 11:53.741
Yes, I did.

11:53.744 --> 11:57.245
I saw my people starving
and suffering and giving up,

11:57.246 --> 11:59.413
and I said, "Not on my watch."

11:59.415 --> 12:00.414
There's something wrong
with this apple.

12:01.518 --> 12:03.250
This orange isn't that great
either.

12:03.253 --> 12:05.220
This is prop food.

12:05.221 --> 12:06.988
He's right.
This is all fake.

12:06.990 --> 12:08.155
This box says "Wheat Thicks."

12:08.158 --> 12:10.424
No, this is real food.

12:10.427 --> 12:11.426
Look at these grapes.

12:18.033 --> 12:21.769
- How's that grape?
- It's good, yeah.

12:21.770 --> 12:23.403
Fine, it's prop food.

12:23.405 --> 12:25.405
It's not like anybody else
did anything.

12:27.610 --> 12:28.775
Oh.

12:29.980 --> 12:31.913
Well,
who turned on the lights?

12:31.914 --> 12:33.480
I did.

12:33.482 --> 12:36.084
While Ana led you
on a wild goose chase,

12:36.086 --> 12:38.786
I figured out
how to reset the fuse box.

12:38.788 --> 12:40.187
I could have
turned the lights on.

12:40.190 --> 12:41.990
But you didn't.
I did.

12:41.991 --> 12:43.725
All you did was ban food
from set,

12:43.726 --> 12:44.993
and now everybody is starving.

12:44.995 --> 12:46.760
And then you tried to trick us
into eating fake food.

12:46.763 --> 12:49.663
Yeah, what are we supposed
to do with these N&Ns?

12:49.665 --> 12:51.331
Ana's a false prophet!

12:51.334 --> 12:52.299
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:52.302 --> 12:53.934
- Yeah.
- Me?

12:53.937 --> 12:55.636
You think we're screwed
'cause of me?

12:55.639 --> 12:58.172
This is your fault.

12:58.173 --> 12:59.841
You know why I had to ban food
on set?

12:59.842 --> 13:01.775
Because you guys
have no self control.

13:01.778 --> 13:04.077
And Xavi, if you learned
how to cry on cue,

13:04.080 --> 13:05.812
we would have gotten out
before the hurricane!

13:05.815 --> 13:08.081
And everything takes so long

13:08.083 --> 13:10.551
because Rodrigo
over-rolls his Rs!

13:10.552 --> 13:12.386
What?
That's r-r-r-ridiculous.

13:12.389 --> 13:15.322
And we got a late start
because of Roxie!

13:15.325 --> 13:16.957
- I was at a funeral.
- Well,

13:16.960 --> 13:19.293
I'm already speaking at
this volume so I can't stop now!

13:19.296 --> 13:20.761
Hey, Ana, you're acting crazy.

13:20.764 --> 13:22.397
- And you.
- What?

13:22.399 --> 13:25.365
Your car smells like a pee wee
soccer team threw up in there.

13:25.368 --> 13:26.734
I cleaned it three times.

13:26.735 --> 13:28.201
You said it
didn't smell anymore.

13:28.203 --> 13:30.203
Well, it does.

13:30.206 --> 13:33.408
Ana, we are tired
of taking your abuse.

13:33.409 --> 13:34.575
It's time for you to leave.

13:34.576 --> 13:37.511
All those in favor
of banishing Ana, say aye.

13:37.514 --> 13:39.713
- Aye.
- Ay-yi-yi.

13:39.716 --> 13:41.282
Aye.

13:41.283 --> 13:42.549
All those opposed?

13:42.552 --> 13:46.120
Nay!
Well, guess what.

13:46.121 --> 13:48.489
There's a hurricane outside
and we're stuck here.

13:48.490 --> 13:49.856
Where am I supposed to go?

13:49.859 --> 13:54.761
Help!

13:55.999 --> 13:58.265
You will be fine.

13:59.336 --> 14:01.201
<i>All of this is red now,</i>

14:01.203 --> 14:03.171
<i>and I know you can't tell
because my dress is red,</i>

14:03.173 --> 14:05.173
<i>but trust me,
créeme, it's bad.</i>

14:05.174 --> 14:08.543
She's so beautiful.

14:10.679 --> 14:11.980
Yeah.

14:11.981 --> 14:14.081
Look, if you really want
to have no regrets,

14:14.083 --> 14:15.549
you should ask her out.

14:15.552 --> 14:18.119
I can't. You said so yourself,
she'll probably just say no.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.687
Well, there's a chance
she'll say yes.

14:19.688 --> 14:21.489
She might be lightheaded
from the hunger.

14:21.490 --> 14:24.125
I know I'm so hungry,
I'm literally wasting away.

14:24.126 --> 14:27.327
You're right.
Whew.

14:27.330 --> 14:30.431
<i>Most of Florida
will be swallowed by the storm.</i>

14:30.432 --> 14:34.869
<i>Again, the red part is bad,
and the green part is good.</i>

14:34.870 --> 14:38.505
- Nope.
- You're being outr-r-r-rageous!

14:42.846 --> 14:45.245
Enjoying your banishment?

14:45.248 --> 14:46.614
I can't believe
you didn't have my back.

14:46.615 --> 14:48.982
Hey, I am very angry at you,

14:48.985 --> 14:50.717
but now I'm feeling
a little lightheaded

14:50.720 --> 14:52.386
because the air conditioner's
still not working, it's hot,

14:52.389 --> 14:54.389
and I'm hungry,
so remind me why?

14:54.390 --> 14:56.624
I said some stuff,
but you guys made me.

14:56.625 --> 14:58.658
Well, Gael's in charge now,
so, yeah,

14:58.661 --> 15:00.861
- we're doing great without you.
- Oh, really?

15:00.864 --> 15:03.697
Xavi and Rodrigo
are already mid-slap fight.

15:03.700 --> 15:05.767
Hit him. Hit him, Xavi.

15:05.769 --> 15:06.768
Hit him again.

15:06.769 --> 15:08.135
Again?

15:10.105 --> 15:13.341
It's so hot.

15:13.342 --> 15:14.609
I didn't find any food,

15:14.610 --> 15:17.412
but why do you have
so many ACE bandages?

15:17.413 --> 15:19.880
Put those down and focus.

15:19.883 --> 15:22.616
I think we need to dig a little
deeper to get you to tears.

15:22.619 --> 15:24.652
What's your most traumatic
childhood memory?

15:24.653 --> 15:26.019
Oh, that's easy.

15:26.022 --> 15:27.788
It was the Christmas
when I was 11.

15:27.791 --> 15:29.990
There were no presents
under the tree that year.

15:29.993 --> 15:32.225
Yes, great stuff.

15:32.227 --> 15:35.196
No, instead of presents,
we got a pool.

15:35.197 --> 15:37.030
It was the best Christmas ever.

15:39.635 --> 15:41.269
What?
It was.

15:41.270 --> 15:44.238
<i>Guess what.
It's still raining.</i>

15:44.240 --> 15:47.174
<i>What? I'm not supposed
to even be here.</i>

15:47.177 --> 15:48.341
All right, everyone,
listen up.

15:49.645 --> 15:51.745
In case the power goes out
again, we need batteries,

15:51.748 --> 15:53.748
and we need them stat.

15:53.750 --> 15:55.015
Did that sound cool?

15:55.018 --> 15:56.884
No.

15:56.885 --> 15:58.686
Xavi and Isabela,
I need you to--

15:58.687 --> 15:59.754
Can't!
Too sweaty.

15:59.755 --> 16:01.655
Why don't you cry about it?

16:01.658 --> 16:02.889
All right,
do you know what we need?

16:02.892 --> 16:04.225
Energies.

16:04.226 --> 16:05.993
I found this candy bar
in the sound department.

16:07.197 --> 16:09.029
It seems like the boom guy
has a sweet tooth

16:09.032 --> 16:11.065
and a serious porn addiction.

16:11.067 --> 16:12.799
Let's just cut it up
and share it now.

16:12.802 --> 16:15.870
Is it real, or is it, like,
another pack of Starblursts?

16:15.871 --> 16:17.270
Have you been holding out
on us?

16:17.273 --> 16:19.573
What? No. I was saving it
to share with everyone.

16:19.576 --> 16:21.042
I'll give you 50 bucks for it.

16:21.043 --> 16:22.243
- I'll make out with you.
- I'll make out with you.

16:22.245 --> 16:23.744
We can all have some.

16:23.745 --> 16:25.613
We just have to cut it
into teeny, tiny, little pieces.

16:25.615 --> 16:27.548
- Give it.
- Give it.

16:27.549 --> 16:28.649
You people are monsters.

16:28.650 --> 16:29.884
- Give us the candy, Gael.
- You know what?

16:29.885 --> 16:31.284
Now no one gets any.

16:32.956 --> 16:34.654
No!

16:34.657 --> 16:37.457
There.
Now what are you gonna do?

16:40.963 --> 16:43.463
- Are you done with that?
- Yup.

16:45.000 --> 16:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:53.058 --> 16:54.658
Woo-hoo, got another one.

16:54.661 --> 16:57.161
Man, there are a lot of ants
around here.

16:58.565 --> 17:00.597
Ahh.

17:09.976 --> 17:12.175
I'm sorry I lied to you
about Safety Captain.

17:12.178 --> 17:14.045
That's not what I'm mad about.

17:14.047 --> 17:15.712
- That I was mean about it?
- No.

17:15.714 --> 17:17.515
- That I didn't listen to you?
- Not it.

17:17.517 --> 17:19.284
- Ripped off your badge?
- Nope.

17:19.286 --> 17:21.184
Man, I did a lot
of bad stuff today.

17:21.185 --> 17:23.621
Ana, the thing that really
upset me was for once,

17:23.623 --> 17:25.490
I thought you were treating me
like your equal,

17:25.491 --> 17:27.057
not some little brother

17:27.059 --> 17:28.726
who you would totally sleep with
if he wasn't gay.

17:28.728 --> 17:30.094
I should stop
telling people that.

17:30.096 --> 17:31.362
It's pretty weird.

17:31.364 --> 17:32.497
Gael, I love you.

17:32.499 --> 17:34.531
That's why I try to protect you.

17:34.534 --> 17:37.101
I don't want some jerk
to come in and steamroll you

17:37.103 --> 17:39.436
and hurt your feelings
and do exactly what I did.

17:39.439 --> 17:42.006
My God,
I'm a horrible person.

17:42.008 --> 17:43.141
You know
what else is horrible?

17:43.143 --> 17:45.209
Me as Safety Captain.

17:45.211 --> 17:47.979
I'm sorry
I didn't have more faith in you.

17:47.980 --> 17:50.748
The truth is if I was stuck
on an actual deserted island,

17:50.750 --> 17:52.717
the only thing
I'd want with me is you.

17:52.719 --> 17:53.984
Really?

17:53.987 --> 17:55.385
I would want matches,

17:55.387 --> 17:57.387
sunscreen, maybe a water
purification system--

17:57.390 --> 17:58.522
Yeah, I was just being sweet.

17:58.525 --> 18:00.157
Oh, right, sorry.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.126
Well, you and I made up,

18:03.128 --> 18:04.662
but everyone else
is still mad at us.

18:04.663 --> 18:08.132
About that,
I do have an idea.

18:08.134 --> 18:11.935
Well, whatever it is,
I'm 100% on board.

18:11.938 --> 18:14.172
Okay, maybe like 80% on board.

18:14.173 --> 18:15.440
We're going out
into the hurricane.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.375
This is so you don't blow away.

18:17.376 --> 18:19.410
The only way to stop everyone
from being mad at us

18:19.412 --> 18:20.577
is to feed them,

18:20.579 --> 18:23.448
so we run to the Cuban market
down the street.

18:23.450 --> 18:26.351
Actually, that guy's been
giving me dirty looks,

18:26.353 --> 18:29.988
and I don't love
his chip selection, so new plan.

18:29.990 --> 18:31.655
We hit the mini mart
next to the gas station

18:31.657 --> 18:34.358
and run back before being
swallowed up by the storm.

18:34.361 --> 18:35.993
Okay.
Let's do this.

18:35.996 --> 18:37.127
I have total faith in you.

18:37.130 --> 18:38.395
Besides, if we die,

18:38.397 --> 18:40.664
how cute would our obituary pics
look next to each other?

18:40.666 --> 18:42.232
- So cute.
- Right?

18:42.234 --> 18:44.234
Okay, on the count
of three, are you ready?

18:44.237 --> 18:46.837
- Ready.
- One, two, three.

18:46.839 --> 18:50.008
If I die, give my massage
chair to Mimi!

18:50.009 --> 18:51.308
<i>♪ square one, square two,
square three and again ♪</i>

18:52.811 --> 18:55.145
<i>♪ I live my life like
I'm on a hopscotch ♪</i>

18:55.147 --> 18:56.447
Where did Chloe go?

18:56.449 --> 18:57.615
I don't know.

18:57.616 --> 18:59.450
Chloe?

18:59.451 --> 19:01.219
Chlo-Chlo?

19:01.221 --> 19:03.287
How did we not know
it was over?

19:03.288 --> 19:05.088
We should really
watch the news more.

19:05.090 --> 19:06.656
Well, we should probably
go tell everybody

19:06.659 --> 19:09.160
- the storm is gone.
- Or...

19:09.162 --> 19:11.628
<i>♪ everything will be
washed away ♪</i>

19:11.631 --> 19:13.530
At least I'm gonna leave
behind a beautiful corpse.

19:13.532 --> 19:15.967
<i>♪ I live my life
like I'm on a hopscotch ♪</i>

19:15.969 --> 19:18.635
- Guys, we have food.
- Food?

19:18.637 --> 19:21.506
Oh! I've never been
so happy to see you guys.

19:21.508 --> 19:24.741
Actually, I've never been
happy to see you guys.

19:24.743 --> 19:27.111
You r-r-really,
r-r-really r-r-rock.

19:27.113 --> 19:29.881
Wow, I do roll my Rs too much.

19:29.883 --> 19:31.648
I can't believe you two idiots
went out into that storm.

19:31.651 --> 19:33.250
- You could have been killed.
- I know.

19:33.252 --> 19:35.420
Gael and I barely escaped
with our lives.

19:38.258 --> 19:40.458
<i>♪ oh, my skies are clear ♪</i>

19:42.162 --> 19:43.827
So it's best everyone
just stay inside

19:43.829 --> 19:45.430
until the storm clears.

19:45.432 --> 19:47.131
Which could be
in the next five to ten minutes

19:47.133 --> 19:48.332
because storms
are crazy like that.

19:48.334 --> 19:49.333
Yeah.

19:49.335 --> 19:50.734
These corn chips
are to die for.

19:50.737 --> 19:52.202
Comes in smokin' bacon cheddar?

19:52.204 --> 19:53.570
Oh, no, they didn't.

19:53.573 --> 19:55.239
This box is harder to open
than a Christmas present.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.673
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
less jokes, more opening.

19:56.675 --> 19:59.676
I think I just ate
the wrapper.

19:59.679 --> 20:01.612
Xavi, you're crying.

20:01.614 --> 20:03.114
I can't help it.

20:03.115 --> 20:06.317
This pudding is so good.

20:06.318 --> 20:08.318
Wait.
Can you cry from happiness?

20:08.320 --> 20:10.488
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, my God.

20:10.490 --> 20:13.590
Acting is so easy.

20:13.593 --> 20:18.128
<i>Finally,
the hurricane is over.</i>

20:18.131 --> 20:19.896
<i>I'm out of here, and I better
be getting overtime.</i>

20:23.536 --> 20:25.536
Oh, again?

20:25.538 --> 20:27.505
We really need to watch
where we're walking.

20:27.507 --> 20:29.339
Roxie?

20:29.342 --> 20:32.042
I know once we leave, things are
gonna go back to normal,

20:32.045 --> 20:33.277
and I don't want
to have any regrets,

20:33.278 --> 20:34.846
so here it goes.

20:34.847 --> 20:36.247
I like you.

20:36.249 --> 20:39.049
You're beautiful and fun
and smarter than people think,

20:39.051 --> 20:41.051
and I know there is zero chance

20:41.054 --> 20:42.653
you would ever go out
with a guy like me,

20:42.654 --> 20:44.521
so I'm gonna
let you say no right now,

20:44.523 --> 20:47.525
and then we can move on
and go back to being friends.

20:47.527 --> 20:51.095
Roxie, will you go out on a date
with me, blah, blah, blah?

20:51.096 --> 20:53.498
Great, see you tomorrow.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.032
Maybe.

20:56.035 --> 20:57.634
Maybe?

20:57.636 --> 20:59.804
Wait, that's not a no?

20:59.806 --> 21:02.006
It's not a no.

21:04.510 --> 21:07.545
She said not a no.

21:07.547 --> 21:11.315
She said not a no!
She said not a no!

21:12.384 --> 21:15.384
