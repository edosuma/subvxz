-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:03.670 --> 00:05.213
IN FRONT OF
A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.296 --> 00:07.632
- OH, LOOK AT OUR BABY.

00:07.716 --> 00:10.760
HE'S SO DEPRESSED.

00:12.053 --> 00:14.055
- MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST TAKE HIM
BACK TO THE VET.

00:14.139 --> 00:15.932
- NO, THE VET SAID
HE WAS FINE, PHYSICALLY.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.892
- WELL, MAYBE HE'S JUST SAD
BECAUSE JOY

00:17.976 --> 00:20.729
LOOKS LIKE A BONE
HE CAN'T CHEW ON.

00:28.027 --> 00:29.738
[knock at door]

00:29.821 --> 00:31.656
- OR MAYBE BECAUSE
FOR EVERY ONE OF OUR YEARS,

00:31.740 --> 00:33.116
HE AGES SEVEN.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.994
THAT WOULD DEPRESS THE HELL
OUT OF ME.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.664
- HELLO, VICTORIA.

00:39.748 --> 00:40.623
YOUR DOG NEEDS HELP.

00:40.707 --> 00:44.586
- OH, WE WERE JUST SAYING THAT.
AND YOU ARE?

00:44.669 --> 00:47.922
- I'M SALLY,
YOUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.507
I WAS YOUR NURSE WHEN
YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL.

00:49.591 --> 00:50.800
I MADE YOU A LASAGNA

00:50.884 --> 00:52.302
WHEN YOU GAVE AWAY
YOUR KIDNEY.

00:52.385 --> 00:53.511
YOU GAVE ME A MAKEOVER.

00:53.595 --> 00:56.556
- OH, NOT RECENTLY,
I HOPE.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.101
- WELL, YOU'RE
MAKING THIS EASIER.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.352
HERE'S A BILL.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.146
YOUR DOG
GOT INTO MY HOUSE,

01:03.229 --> 01:04.605
CHEWED THROUGH
THE ELECTRICAL CORD

01:04.688 --> 01:05.982
ON MY CROCKPOT,

01:06.065 --> 01:07.817
AND THE SLOPPY JOE
ENDED UP ON THE FLOOR.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.319
- ALL RIGHT, I LITERALLY
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

01:09.402 --> 01:11.488
A WORD YOU JUST SAID.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.783
IS SLOPPY JOE YOUR HUSBAND?

01:14.866 --> 01:18.161
- YES, VICTORIA,
SLOPPY JOE IS MY HUSBAND.

01:18.244 --> 01:21.039
AND MY KIDS
ARE PORK AND BEANS.

01:21.122 --> 01:24.375
- YES, I'VE SEEN THEM.

01:24.459 --> 01:27.378
- SALLY, WE ARE SO SORRY.

01:27.462 --> 01:28.463
WE WILL TAKE CARE OF IT.

01:28.546 --> 01:29.672
- THANK YOU.
- OKAY.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.050
- GEORGE, YOU CAN'T
CHEW THROUGH CORDS.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.802
YOU COULD KILL YOURSELF.

01:33.885 --> 01:36.012
OH, MY GOD, WHAT IF HE
WAS TRYING TO KILL HIMSELF?

01:36.095 --> 01:37.180
IS HE THAT DEPRESSED?

01:37.263 --> 01:38.848
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

01:38.932 --> 01:40.391
- MAYBE WE SHOULD
CALL THAT LADY

01:40.475 --> 01:41.810
THAT TALKS TO ANIMALS
ON THE RADIO.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.228
YEAH, SHE COMES
TO YOUR HOME,

01:43.311 --> 01:44.687
INTERVIEWS THE FAMILY,

01:44.771 --> 01:46.189
AND THEN TELLS YOU
HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

01:46.272 --> 01:47.524
THEN A WEEK LATER,
YOU GO ON HER SHOW

01:47.607 --> 01:48.691
AND YOU TELL HER
WHAT HAPPENED.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.360
- IN THE MEANTIME,
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING

01:50.443 --> 01:52.654
WE CAN DO TO CHEER HIM UP.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.864
WHAT DO I DO
WHEN I NEED CHEERING UP?

01:54.948 --> 01:56.574
- HE CAN'T DO THAT, JOY.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.869
HE'S BEEN FIXED.

02:20.139 --> 02:21.724
{\an8}- DO YOU DO THAT OFTEN?
- WHAT?

02:21.808 --> 02:24.060
{\an8}- INTERRUPT HIM.

02:24.143 --> 02:26.437
{\an8}MILO, WOULD YOU PLEASE
TAKE GEORGE IN THE KITCHEN

02:26.521 --> 02:27.939

WITH HIS PEOPLE?

02:28.022 --> 02:29.357
{\an8}- YEAH.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.860
{\an8}ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO, BOY.

02:31.943 --> 02:34.737
{\an8}- YOUR DOG IS
EXTREMELY TRAUMATIZED.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.240
{\an8}YOU SEE,
ANIMALS SOAK UP EMOTIONS,

02:37.323 --> 02:39.075
{\an8}BOTH GOOD AND BAD.

02:39.158 --> 02:42.579
{\an8}SO, I BELIEVE THAT HE IS JUST
REACTING TO THE ANXIETY

02:42.662 --> 02:44.789
{\an8}AND DEPRESSION THAT
ALREADY EXISTS IN THE HOME.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.208
{\an8}- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
SO WE'RE THE PROBLEM?

02:47.292 --> 02:48.626

THIS IS A VERY UNUSUAL

{\an8}FAMILY ARRANGEMENT
YOU HAVE HERE.

02:50.378 --> 02:53.882
{\an8}I MEAN, THREE GROWN SISTERS
LIVING WITH THEIR MOTHER?

02:55.675 --> 02:58.428
{\an8}- OH, SHE'S NOT OUR MOTHER.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.641
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:03.725 --> 03:05.476
{\an8}LET'S TRY
A QUICK ASSESSMENT HERE.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.771
{\an8}MELANIE, I WANT YOU TO PET ME
LIKE YOU PET GEORGE.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.526
{\an8}- OKAY.

03:15.361 --> 03:18.156
{\an8}- OKAY, I'M GONNA STOP YOU,
'CAUSE THAT'S JUST SAD.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.201
{\an8}YOU'RE GOING THROUGH SOMETHING,
AREN'T YOU?

03:22.285 --> 03:25.496
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD, MAYBE IT'S ME
WHO'S DEPRESSING GEORGE.

03:25.580 --> 03:26.998
{\an8}YOU SEE, I JUST--
I JUST GOT OVER

03:27.081 --> 03:28.291
{\an8}A PRETTY SERIOUS ILLNESS.

03:28.374 --> 03:29.959
{\an8}- YES, HE MENTIONED THAT.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.920
{\an8}- OH. MM.

03:33.880 --> 03:34.797
WELL, I-I FEEL,
I DON'T KNOW,

03:34.881 --> 03:36.299
LIKE I WAS SPARED
FOR A REASON.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.800
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT REASON IS.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.344
AND I-I GUESS I'M FEELING
A LITTLE LOST.

03:39.427 --> 03:40.470
MAYBE GEORGE
IS PICKING UP ON THAT.

03:40.553 --> 03:41.471
I'M SO SORRY.

03:41.554 --> 03:42.764
- OH, DON'T BE, MELANIE.

03:42.847 --> 03:44.432
IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S ME.

03:44.515 --> 03:45.600
AND I'M NOT JUST
SAYING THAT BECAUSE

03:45.683 --> 03:49.979
IT'S THE DRAMATIC THING
TO DO.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.606
I'M A RECENT WINDOW,

03:51.689 --> 03:53.983
AND I AM STILL DEPRESSED
ABOUT THAT.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.818
I MEAN, I'D LIKE
TO START DATING AGAIN,

03:55.902 --> 03:58.613
BUT IT'S SO HARD TO FIND
A NICE, NORMAL GUY.

03:58.696 --> 04:00.031
- [laughs]
OH, COME ON.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.824
CLEVELAND'S FILLED
WITH NICE, NORMAL GUYS

04:01.908 --> 04:03.660
WHO'D LOVE TO GO OUT
WITH YOU.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.828
YOU EVER DATE GUYS
WHO AREN'T MOVIE STARS?

04:05.912 --> 04:09.332
- YOU MEAN LIKE
AGENTS OR DIRECTORS?

04:09.415 --> 04:12.627
NOT IF I CAN AVOID IT.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.504
- ARE YOU SURE IT'S NOT JOY?

04:14.587 --> 04:17.173
SHE DEPRESSES ME.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.507
- ME?

04:18.591 --> 04:19.841
IF ANYONE, IT'S YOU.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.678
WHEN YOU SPOKE TO GEORGE,

04:21.761 --> 04:26.015
DID HE USE THE WORDS,
"CRONE," "HAG," "FOSSIL"?

04:26.099 --> 04:28.893
- NO, BUT THIS
UNATTRACTIVE SNIPING

04:28.977 --> 04:30.561
IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE
OF THE TENSION

04:30.645 --> 04:32.021
THAT DOGS ARE SENSITIVE TO.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.815
- OH, WE'RE NOT SNIPING.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.192
- NO, THAT'S HOW WE TALK.
- YEAH.

04:36.275 --> 04:38.027
WE KEEP THINGS
LOOSE AND EASY.

04:38.111 --> 04:38.945
- [chuckles]

04:39.028 --> 04:42.448
WHICH WAS JOY'S NICKNAME
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

04:45.410 --> 04:49.038
- SAID THE WOMAN
WHO WAS CAVE-SCHOOLED.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.376
OH, MY GOD, WE DO DO IT.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.878
- LISTEN. THIS ISN'T
ANYONE'S FAULT, OKAY?

04:55.962 --> 04:58.381
YOU'RE ALL TO BLAME.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.843
JOY, ELKA, YOU NEED TO BE
MORE POLITE TO ONE ANOTHER,

05:01.926 --> 05:04.012
EVEN WHEN THE DOG
ISN'T AROUND.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.055
VICTORIA, YOU NEED
TO FIND YOURSELF

05:06.139 --> 05:09.392
A NICE, NORMAL GUY, OKAY?

05:09.475 --> 05:11.644
AND MELANIE--
SWEET, INNOCENT,

05:11.728 --> 05:14.480
NAIVE, DUMB-AS-A-DUCK
MELANIE.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.569
MELANIE, YOU NEED TO FIND
A PURPOSE TO YOUR LIFE.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.529
- BETTER GET GOING, DR. DEB.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.031
WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH A PRIVATE CLIENT.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.407
- YES, YES.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.075
IF YOU LADIES
WILL EXCUSE ME,

05:26.159 --> 05:29.245
I NEED TO SEE A HORSE
ABOUT A MAN.

05:31.497 --> 05:35.126
- UH, HERE'S MY NUMBER.

05:35.209 --> 05:37.420
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT ANYTHING,

05:37.503 --> 05:39.088
JUST FEEL FREE TO CALL.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.300
- IS DR. DEB
ALWAYS SO STRANGE?

05:42.383 --> 05:45.678
- UM, ACTUALLY, IN THE WORLD
WHERE PEOPLE TALK TO ANIMALS,

05:45.762 --> 05:47.430
SHE'S PRETTY NORMAL.

05:47.513 --> 05:51.267
- [whistles]
MILO, COME HERE, BOY!

05:53.144 --> 05:55.897
- SHE HAS HER QUIRKS.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.445
- HEY, DID YOU HAVE FUN
AT THE PARK?

06:02.528 --> 06:04.155
DID YOU MEET
ANY NICE, AVERAGE GUYS?

06:04.238 --> 06:05.865
- I MET
AN UNDERCOVER POLICEMAN.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.492
- SOUNDS PROMISING.

06:07.575 --> 06:08.951
WAIT, HOW DID YOU KNOW
HE WAS UNDERCOVER?

06:09.035 --> 06:10.119
- WELL, I NEEDED
TO FIND OUT

06:10.203 --> 06:11.746
IF HE WAS ORDINARY
AND NOT RICH,

06:11.829 --> 06:13.122
SO I ASKED HIM
HOW MUCH MONEY HE HAD

06:13.206 --> 06:14.791
AND IF HE WAS LOOKING
FOR A DATE,

06:14.874 --> 06:18.669
AND HE ARRESTED ME
FOR SUSPECTED PROSTITUTION.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.631
I NEED A DRINK.

06:21.714 --> 06:22.965
- FUNNY YOU SHOULD SAY THAT.
- WHY?

06:23.049 --> 06:25.134
I SAY THAT FIVE TIMES A DAY.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.845
- FUNNY, BECAUSE
I JUST GOT A JOB TODAY

06:27.929 --> 06:29.806
AS A BARTENDER
AT STORMI'S.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.974
- BARTENDER?
- STAY WITH ME.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.477
I WAS THINKING,
WHEN IN MY LIFE

06:34.560 --> 06:35.978
DID I FEEL
THE MOST FULFILLED?

06:36.062 --> 06:37.480
AND IT WAS WHEN
MY KIDS WERE YOUNG

06:37.563 --> 06:38.648
AND I WAS GIVING THEM ADVICE.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.650
I LIKE GIVING ADVICE.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.820
SO THEN I REALIZED,
MAYBE THAT'S MY PURPOSE.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.155
- WELL, BARTENDERS
DO GIVE ADVICE.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.449
- AND HERE'S MY FIRST BIT
OF ADVICE:

06:48.533 --> 06:49.992
COME WITH ME
TO THE BAR TONIGHT.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.828
THERE'S A TON
OF AVERAGE GUYS THERE.

06:51.911 --> 06:55.832
FIVES AS FAR
AS THE EYE CAN SEE.

06:55.915 --> 06:56.833
OH, AND I'LL CARD YOU
OUT LOUD.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.960
- I'M IN.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.673
- OH. I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU'D BE HERE.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.508
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU'D BE HERE.

07:05.591 --> 07:06.634
- HEY, I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE SUPPOSED

07:06.717 --> 07:08.219
TO BE GETTING ALONG.

07:08.302 --> 07:10.680
- WE TRIED ALL MORNING
NOT TO SNIPE AT EACH OTHER,

07:10.763 --> 07:12.014
AND KNOWING
WE CAN'T SNIPE AT EACH OTHER

07:12.098 --> 07:14.058
ONLY MADE US SNIPE
AT EACH OTHER MORE.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.351
- WELL, YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY
FROM THE PROBLEM.

07:15.434 --> 07:19.105
- THE PROBLEM IS 92 YEARS OLD.
I THINK I CAN.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.401
- WE ARE DOING THIS
FOR GEORGE.

07:23.484 --> 07:24.652
NOW COME ON.

07:24.735 --> 07:25.862
COME JOIN US AT THE BAR,

07:25.945 --> 07:26.696
AND YOU GUYS CAN
HAVE DINNER TOGETHER--

07:26.779 --> 07:28.322
JUST THE TWO OF YOU.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.408
- IT'S EASY TO GET ALONG
WITH PEOPLE YOU DISLIKE.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.535
JUST SAY THE OPPOSITE
OF WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

07:32.618 --> 07:35.329
- WELL, I CAN DO THAT.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.165
- ME TOO.

07:37.248 --> 07:40.209
- YOU KNOW, ELKA,
I CAN STAND YOU.

07:41.794 --> 07:46.299
- AND YOUR OUTFIT IS
SO APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR AGE.

07:46.382 --> 07:48.467
- THAT'S FUNNY.

07:48.551 --> 07:51.554
LET'S GO, YOUNG LADY.
I'M DRIVING.

07:51.637 --> 07:55.683
- OH, GOOD.
YOU'RE AN EXCELLENT DRIVER.

07:55.766 --> 07:58.394
- AND YOUR READING
EVERY BILLBOARD OUT LOUD

07:58.477 --> 08:00.730
MAKES ME WANT
TO KEEP MYSELF ALIVE.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.232
- [chuckles]

08:18.664 --> 08:21.459
- DOES THIS TASTE
A LITTLE SWEET TO YOU?

08:22.793 --> 08:24.754
- NO, IT'S GOOD.
- OH, GREAT.

08:24.837 --> 08:27.632
HERE'S YOUR MANHATTAN.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.426
- GIVE ME A SHOT OF ANYTHING.

08:30.509 --> 08:32.303
- OH, THINGS AREN'T
GOING WELL WITH ELKA?

08:32.385 --> 08:35.431
- NO, THE OPPOSITE THING
IS TOO EASY TO TRANSLATE.

08:35.514 --> 08:38.267
SHE JUST CALLED ME
A CHOOSY VIRGIN.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.729
I TOLD HER I'D LIKE
TO UNCHOKE THE LIFE INTO HER.

08:41.812 --> 08:43.105
- KEEP 'EM COMING.

08:43.188 --> 08:44.232
- OOH, ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THAT?

08:44.315 --> 08:46.108
THAT'S YOUR FOURTH ONE.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.568
- HEY, I NEED A FEW DRINKS
SO I CAN GO HOME

08:47.652 --> 08:48.945
AND BE NICE
TO THE OLD LADY.

08:49.028 --> 08:52.073
- [chuckles]
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

08:52.156 --> 08:54.450
- YOU KNOW, IT SOUNDS LIKE

08:54.533 --> 08:56.285
YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE ADVICE.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.412
- OH, I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

08:58.496 --> 09:01.290
I MISSED YOU.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.918
- AND I YOU.

09:04.001 --> 09:06.087
BY THE WAY, NOT THAT
THIS IS A CONTEST,

09:06.170 --> 09:07.755
BUT I WILL WIN.

09:07.838 --> 09:10.299
YOU WILL INSULT ME
BEFORE I INSULT YOU.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.010
- I DON'T THINK SO, JOY.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.221
- OH, DEAR.

09:15.304 --> 09:19.433
MY SODA'S GONE FLAT.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.519
- NICE TRY.

09:21.602 --> 09:25.606
YOU MUST THINK I WAS BORN...

09:25.690 --> 09:28.484
YESTERDAY.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.027
- I'M SORRY, ELKA.

09:30.111 --> 09:34.115
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
BE THAT EASY.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.325
- I SEE.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.160
WOULD YOU BE A DEAR

09:38.244 --> 09:41.998
AND HAND ME
THAT LEATHERY, OLD BAG?

09:46.544 --> 09:49.714
- OH, WHY IS THIS SO HARD?

09:49.797 --> 09:52.883
BUT SINCE WE CAN'T
INSULT EACH OTHER,

09:52.967 --> 09:55.303
HOW ABOUT WE SCRATCH
EACH OTHER'S ITCH

09:55.386 --> 09:56.679
AND INSULT OURSELVES?

09:56.762 --> 09:58.472
- HOW WOULD THAT WORK?

09:58.556 --> 10:00.683
- WELL, UH, I COULD SAY

10:00.766 --> 10:03.519
I USE MY GIANT MAN HANDS

10:03.602 --> 10:07.273
TO HOLD MY SKANKY
ONE-NIGHT STANDS

10:07.356 --> 10:10.735
AGAINST MY PATHETIC
BOY BOOBS.

10:10.818 --> 10:13.154
THAT SORT OF THING.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.822
OKAY, YOUR TURN.

10:14.905 --> 10:17.658
- ALL RIGHT.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.082
I GOT NOTHING.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.709
- NOTHING?

10:26.792 --> 10:28.377
THERE'S THOUSANDS OF THINGS
WRONG WITH YOU.

10:28.461 --> 10:33.215
INSULT YOURSELF, YOU CROTCHETY
PIECE OF BAT JERKY.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.885
- I WIN.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.348
- IT'S JUST THAT MY WIFE
FINDS FAULT

10:40.431 --> 10:41.891
IN EVERYTHING THAT I DO.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.893
- YOU KNOW,
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.186
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

10:45.269 --> 10:47.063
YOU GAVE YOUR WIFE FLOWERS
FOR NO REASON?

10:47.146 --> 10:48.397
- I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER DONE THAT.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.066
- EXACTLY.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.734
NOW THERE'S A FLOWER SHOP
AROUND THE CORNER.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.903
GO THERE, SPEND TOO MUCH,
GO HOME,

10:53.986 --> 10:55.780
AND THEN TELL YOUR WIFE
THREE NICE THINGS

10:55.863 --> 10:57.573
YOU KNOW WILL MELT HER HEART.

10:57.656 --> 10:59.617
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:59.700 --> 11:01.243
TAKE THIS.

11:01.327 --> 11:04.246
- I'LL GIVE IT A TRY.
THANKS.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.457
- I'VE BEEN HELPING PEOPLE
LIKE THAT ALL NIGHT.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.584
- REALLY?
THE BAR'S PRETTY EMPTY.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.836
- OH, WELL, THERE WERE
MORE PEOPLE HERE EARLIER.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.380
BUT I TOLD ONE GUY
TO GO HOME

11:12.463 --> 11:13.839
AND SPEND MORE TIME
WITH HIS SON.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.132
AND I TOLD A GROUP
OF COLLEGE KIDS

11:15.216 --> 11:16.258
THAT SITTING AROUND
AND DRINKING ALL NIGHT

11:16.342 --> 11:17.301
WOULD RUIN THEIR LIVES.

11:17.385 --> 11:18.386
- AND THEY LISTENED TO YOU?

11:18.469 --> 11:20.721
- WELL, THEY LEFT.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.932
- MELANIE, YOUR TRIAL PERIOD
IS OVER.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.433
- OH, AND I'M HIRED?

11:24.517 --> 11:27.770
- OH, IT RHYMES WITH HIRED.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.731
- LOOK, THE POINT OF BARTENDING
IS TO ENCOURAGE MORE DRINKING,

11:30.815 --> 11:32.274
NOT TELLING PEOPLE
THEY'VE HAD TOO MUCH

11:32.358 --> 11:34.443
OR THEY SHOULD BE HOME
WITH THEIR FAMILIES.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.112
WAIT A MINUTE.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.280
WHERE'S THAT BOTTLE
OF CHATEAU MARGAUX I PUT ASIDE?

11:38.364 --> 11:39.615
- OH, WELL, I GAVE IT AWAY.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.659
BUT IT WAS TO SAVE
A MAN'S MARRIAGE.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.537
- I WISH I COULD
FIRE YOU AGAIN.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.290
- I'M SORRY, HONEY.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.376
HOW ABOUT WE ALL HEAD HOME
AND CALL IT A NIGHT?

11:50.459 --> 11:52.294
- NO, I-I'M GONNA STAY,

11:52.378 --> 11:53.796
YOU KNOW, FOR GEORGE'S SAKE.

11:53.879 --> 11:54.839
I THINK I SHOULD
TAKE ANOTHER STAB

11:54.922 --> 11:56.465
AT FINDING A REGULAR GUY.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.718
- OH, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
- HAVE FUN.

11:59.802 --> 12:02.721
- BEER, PLEASE.

12:06.725 --> 12:11.105
- HELLO,
I'M ALSO DRINKING BEER.

12:11.188 --> 12:14.108
- WOW, I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO RUN INTO VICTORIA CHASE HERE.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.776
- [chuckles]
OH, DON'T THINK OF ME

12:15.860 --> 12:17.653
AS A FAMOUS,
GLAMOROUS ACTRESS.

12:17.736 --> 12:20.114
NO, I'M JUST
A NICE, AVERAGE GIRL

12:20.197 --> 12:22.491
HAVING A BEER WITH
A NICE, AVERAGE GUY.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.411
- I'VE OFTEN BEEN DESCRIBED
AS AVERAGE.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.665
- SO, WHAT DO YOU
DO FOR FUN?

12:29.748 --> 12:31.333
- OH, YOU KNOW,
THE FOUR "B"s--

12:31.417 --> 12:34.295
BEER, BARBECUE,
BOWLING, BATTING CAGES.

12:34.378 --> 12:35.838
- YOU'RE PERFECT.

12:35.921 --> 12:40.134
- NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE.
[chuckles]

12:40.217 --> 12:42.178
- WELL, I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SAY THESE WORDS:

12:42.261 --> 12:43.679
I WENT BOWLING
AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING

12:43.762 --> 12:46.390
I COULD BE GOOD AT.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.143
- YOU REALIZE YOU DIDN'T
KNOCK OVER A SINGLE PIN?

12:49.226 --> 12:52.354
- WELL, THAT'S NOT REALLY
THE POINT OF BOWLING, IS IT?

12:52.438 --> 12:54.648
- IT KIND OF IS.
- OH.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.692
- YOU'RE CUTE.
- OH, AND YOU ARE FUN.

12:56.775 --> 12:57.735
- AH.

12:57.818 --> 13:00.070
[knock at door]

13:01.780 --> 13:03.365
- OH, IT'S JUST
MY ANNOYING NEIGHBOR,

13:03.449 --> 13:05.201
JULIE OR SUSAN OR--

13:05.284 --> 13:06.202
I DON'T KNOW,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.369
- SALLY?
- YEAH, THAT'S IT.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.537
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

13:08.621 --> 13:12.374
- BECAUSE THAT'S MY WIFE.
- WHAT?

13:12.458 --> 13:14.502
YOU'RE SLOPPY JOE?

13:16.837 --> 13:18.547
- OPEN UP, VICTORIA.
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!

13:18.631 --> 13:19.673
- UH, JUST A MINUTE.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.091
I'M LOADING THE DISHWASHER.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.511
THAT'S A THING, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.137
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE MARRIED?

13:25.221 --> 13:26.472
- I DIDN'T THINK I HAD TO.

13:26.555 --> 13:28.182
I'M YOUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.059
I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.019
WHY DID YOU COME ON TO ME
SO STRONG?

13:32.102 --> 13:33.729
- BUT I DIDN'T
COME ON TO YOU.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.898
- YOU SAID, "HELLO,"
AND YOU ASKED ME A QUESTION.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.776
LAST TIME A WOMAN DID THAT,
I MARRIED HER.

13:42.821 --> 13:45.241
- HI. HERE'S ANOTHER THING
YOUR DOG RUINED,

13:45.324 --> 13:47.076
MY FAVORITE CROCS.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.953
- WELL, WHEN YOU WEAR SHOES
THAT LOOK LIKE CHEW TOYS,

13:49.036 --> 13:50.955
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

13:51.038 --> 13:54.667
LOOK, I'LL WRITE YOU A CHECK
FOR $6.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.085
- SALLY, HONEY,
THERE YOU ARE.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.419
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

13:57.503 --> 13:59.088
- I SAW YOU TALKING
TO VICTORIA,

13:59.171 --> 14:01.048
AND I THOUGHT,
"HEY, THERE'S ONLY ONE WOMAN

14:01.131 --> 14:02.424
"I'M ATTRACTED TO OVER THERE,

14:02.508 --> 14:04.260
AND I NEED TO HAVE HER NOW."

14:04.343 --> 14:05.678
- OKAY, FINE.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.304
BUT THE KIDS ARE HALFWAY
THROUGH <i> SPONGEBOB,</i>

14:07.388 --> 14:08.806
SO WE ONLY HAVE TIME
FOR BOTTOMS OFF.

14:08.889 --> 14:11.100
- AH, DAMN, YOU'RE SEXY.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.735
- SO WE ALL FAILED
AND GEORGE IS WORSE.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.487
- WELL, IT'S HARD
TO FIND A PURPOSE.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.656
I READ SOMEWHERE
THAT ON PEOPLE'S DEATHBEDS,

14:25.739 --> 14:27.283
THEIR BIGGEST REGRET
IS NEVER HAVING

14:27.366 --> 14:29.118
FOUND THEIR PURPOSE
IN THE WORLD.

14:29.201 --> 14:32.121
- THANKS, MELANIE.
NOW I'M PICTURING MY DEATHBED.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.789
AND I'M LYING THERE ALL ALONE

14:33.872 --> 14:37.001
BECAUSE I NEVER FOUND LOVE
AGAIN AFTER EMMET.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.127
SURE, THE PRESS IS THERE,

14:38.210 --> 14:42.214
BUT THAT'S COLD COMFORT.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.466
AND NOW, WITH THE YEARS
FLYING BY SO FAST,

14:44.550 --> 14:45.968
DEATH IS RIGHT
AROUND THE CORNER.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.761
AND SURE WE CAN FAKE IT
WITH BOTOX,

14:47.845 --> 14:51.348
BUT OUR INSIDES KNOW.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.851
- I KNOW MY LIVER DOES.

14:53.934 --> 14:57.313
I'M PROBABLY AGING FASTER
THAN ANY OF YOU.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.189
WHAT IF I END UP
IN A HOME WITH ELKA,

14:59.273 --> 15:00.524
AND WE SPEND OUR FINAL DAYS

15:00.608 --> 15:04.528
BLINKING ANGRILY
AT EACH OTHER?

15:04.612 --> 15:08.490
- DON'T WORRY.
I ALREADY HAVE "DNRJ."

15:08.574 --> 15:10.701
- WHAT'S A "DNRJ"?

15:10.784 --> 15:13.579
- "DO NOT ROOM WITH JOY."

15:16.248 --> 15:20.085
OR MAYBE IT'S,
"DO NOT RESUSCITATE JOY."

15:20.169 --> 15:22.004
- OH, NOW LISTEN TO US.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.672
NO WONDER GEORGE
IS DEPRESSED.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.966
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA SAY
ON THE RADIO TOMORROW?

15:26.050 --> 15:29.345
- WELL, I'VE RECENTLY LEARNED
A LITTLE SOMETHING

15:29.428 --> 15:32.222
ABOUT SAYING THE OPPOSITE
OF WHAT YOU'RE FEELING.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.642
- YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
- HEY!

15:34.725 --> 15:38.771
- I'M DOING
THE OPPOSITE THING.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.524
- LADIES, YOUR DOG
GEORGE CLOONEY

15:42.608 --> 15:44.568
HAS BEEN SUFFERING
FROM DEPRESSION.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.737
ONE WEEK LATER, LADIES,
HOW'S IT GOING?

15:46.820 --> 15:48.030
- FANTASTIC.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.531
- I FOUND A REGULAR GUY

15:49.615 --> 15:52.409
WHO INTRODUCED ME
TO THE BOWLING CAGES.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.539
- AND ELKA AND I
ARE SO CLOSE.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.874
WE'RE FINISHING
EACH OTHER'S--

15:58.957 --> 16:01.126
- MEALS.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.048
- YES, MEALS.

16:06.131 --> 16:09.551
YOU'VE NEVER PLAYED
<i>MATCH GAME,</i> HAVE YOU?

16:09.635 --> 16:11.679
- AND I FOUND MY PURPOSE,
I REALLY DID.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.055
- I KNOW.

16:13.138 --> 16:16.433
GEORGE TOLD ME THAT
HE'S NEVER BEEN HAPPIER.

16:16.517 --> 16:19.603
HIS WORDS, NOT MINE.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.272
- OH, GEORGE TOLD YOU
ALL THAT, DID HE?

16:22.356 --> 16:25.275
- HE CERTAINLY DID,
BARK FOR BARK.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.194
- NO, HE COULDN'T
HAVE SAID THAT.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.737
- WHY NOT?

16:28.821 --> 16:31.073
- BECAUSE EVERYTHING
WE SAID WAS A LIE.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.367
HE'S MISERABLE.
WE'RE MISERABLE.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.911
YOU'RE A FRAUD.
YOU CAN'T TALK TO ANIMALS.

16:35.994 --> 16:37.913
- OF COURSE I CAN.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.957
OH, YEAH,
I SEE WHAT HAPPENED.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.751
SEE, SOMETIMES ANIMALS,
IN AN ATTEMPT

16:42.835 --> 16:46.964
TO PROTECT THEIR OWNERS,
WILL OFTEN SPIN THE TRUTH

16:47.047 --> 16:48.757
IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.468
YEAH.

16:51.552 --> 16:54.430
ALSO, THE WORDS
FOR DEPRESSED AND HAPPY

16:54.513 --> 16:59.101
ARE VERY SIMILAR IN DOG.

16:59.184 --> 17:02.896
OH, GOD, WHAT THE HELL
AM I DOING?

17:02.980 --> 17:05.441
I AM SO TIRED OF THIS.
- A-HA!

17:05.523 --> 17:07.443
SO YOU CAN'T
TALK TO ANIMALS.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.779
- NOBODY CAN
TALK TO ANIMALS.

17:10.863 --> 17:14.450
THIS IS SO NOT
WHAT I WANTED MY LIFE TO BE.

17:14.532 --> 17:17.618
- WELL,
WHAT DID YOU WANNA BE?

17:17.703 --> 17:21.123
- I WANTED TO BE
A VETERINARIAN.

17:21.205 --> 17:24.084
BUT THAT SCHOOL
TAKES FIVE YEARS.

17:24.167 --> 17:27.378
AND BY THE TIME I GRADUATE,
I WOULD BE 45.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.466
- [laughs]
OH, POOR BABY.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.428
- WELL, IN FIVE YEARS,
YOU'RE GONNA BE 45

17:34.511 --> 17:35.804
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.474
SO WOULDN'T YOU RATHER
BE 45 AND A VET?

17:38.557 --> 17:41.852
- I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT
LIKE THAT.

17:41.935 --> 17:44.605
THAT'S REALLY GOOD ADVICE.

17:44.688 --> 17:47.274
I'M GONNA DO IT.

17:47.357 --> 17:49.109
- UH, WE HAVE A CALL.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.528
- NO, I AM OUT OF HERE,
MILO.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.322
- ACTUALLY,
IT'S FOR MELANIE.

17:53.405 --> 17:57.326
- FOR ME?
OH, OKAY.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.453
HI, THIS IS MELANIE.

17:59.536 --> 18:01.455
- FIRST OF ALL, MELANIE,
I THOUGHT THE ADVICE

18:01.538 --> 18:03.582
YOU GAVE DR. DEB
WAS REALLY GOOD.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.709
- OH, THANK YOU.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.211
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

18:07.294 --> 18:09.755
- MY HUSBAND DERRICK
CAME HOME LAST NIGHT

18:09.838 --> 18:14.009
WITH FLOWERS AND A BOTTLE
OF WINE FOR NO REASON.

18:14.092 --> 18:15.844
HE'S HAVING AN AFFAIR,
RIGHT?

18:15.928 --> 18:19.139
- OR MAYBE HE'S
JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU

18:19.223 --> 18:22.476
HE APPRECIATES YOU
WITH THAT CHATEAU MARGAUX.

18:22.559 --> 18:24.394
I'M GUESSING.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.646
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:25.729 --> 18:27.356
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
CUT THE GUY SOME SLACK?

18:27.439 --> 18:29.024
AND IF YOU HAVE
TO CRITICIZE HIM,

18:29.107 --> 18:30.859
DO IT AFTER SEX.

18:30.943 --> 18:35.531
THAT WAY, HE ASSOCIATES
CRITICISM WITH PLEASURE.

18:35.614 --> 18:38.033
- THANK YOU, MELANIE.
I'LL TRY THAT.

18:38.116 --> 18:41.161
- OKAY, YOU'VE
GOT THREE MORE CALLERS.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.704
BUT WE GOTTA GO
TO A COMMERCIAL BREAK.

18:42.788 --> 18:43.872
THERE'S COPY THERE,
RIGHT ON THE DESK.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.374
- WHAT?
- RIGHT ON THE DESK,

18:45.457 --> 18:46.667
RIGHT THERE.
- OH, OKAY, OKAY.

18:46.750 --> 18:50.337
[clears throat]
THIS PORTION OF...

18:50.420 --> 18:52.714
WELL, WHATEVER

19:19.491 --> 19:22.452
SO ALL I NEED NOW
IS A BOARD OP, WHICH--

19:22.536 --> 19:25.581
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

19:25.664 --> 19:26.915

19:48.645 --> 19:49.897
