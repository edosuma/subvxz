on Canada's Drag Race.

00:01.802 --> 00:04.004
- We're throwing The Sinners
Ball.

00:04.004 --> 00:04.838
(cheers)

00:04.838 --> 00:08.008
You'll need to serve three
distinct looks,

00:08.008 --> 00:10.544
"Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll,"

00:10.544 --> 00:12.045
"Ugliest Sin,"

00:12.045 --> 00:16.216
and a look based on one
of the seven deadly sins.

00:16.216 --> 00:19.052
- Icesis Couture.
Con-drag-ulations!

00:19.052 --> 00:20.921
(dance music)
- Thank you so much.

00:20.921 --> 00:22.055
(laughs)

00:22.055 --> 00:26.960
- Kendall Gender, shantay you
stay. Synthia, sashay away.

(techno music)

00:35.769 --> 00:36.603
(sighs)

00:36.603 --> 00:40.841
- Oh my God. Synthia is not
in this competition anymore.

00:40.841 --> 00:44.244
And I am so overcome with
emotion.

00:44.244 --> 00:45.779
Holy shit.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.181
I really want to take a moment

00:48.181 --> 00:50.484
and like appreciate the artist

00:50.484 --> 00:53.687
and the like spectacular human
being that is Synthia Kiss.

00:53.687 --> 00:56.857
I have seen her from
literally the first week

00:56.857 --> 00:58.325
she started drag.

00:58.325 --> 01:00.160
We've been with her
since literally day one.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.363
Synthia is such a star.

01:03.363 --> 01:06.166
She came in here, left her mark,

01:06.166 --> 01:09.803
and it all ends with a kiss.

01:09.803 --> 01:13.040
- We love you so much.
(blowing kisses)

01:13.040 --> 01:15.309
- I love you so much.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.143
- It was a little bit sad

01:16.143 --> 01:19.346
because the sisters had
to go against each other,

01:19.346 --> 01:22.182
but they needed to be split up
anyways so.

01:22.182 --> 01:23.617
- Fuck.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.552
- Let's take a load off.

01:25.552 --> 01:27.921
- Please. I need your loving
energy.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.025
(laughing)

01:32.025 --> 01:33.961
- Your tit is fully out.

01:33.961 --> 01:36.463
- We're the nipples out the
entire time I was performing?

01:36.463 --> 01:37.397
- [Gia] No.
- [Kimora] No.

01:37.397 --> 01:38.465
Performing, we're they out?

01:38.465 --> 01:39.399
No, I don't think so.

01:39.399 --> 01:40.634
(shushes)

01:40.634 --> 01:42.836
- This is absolutely the
furthest thing

01:42.836 --> 01:44.905
that I would ever wear to
perform.

01:44.905 --> 01:45.939
- Yeah.

01:45.939 --> 01:46.773
- So I was just like, "You know
what?

01:46.773 --> 01:47.607
I just have to pretend like I'm
wearing

01:47.607 --> 01:49.710
a fucking Beyonce leotard."

01:49.710 --> 01:51.078
- A body suit, yes.

01:51.078 --> 01:51.912
- You know what?

01:51.912 --> 01:52.746
In retrospect,

01:52.746 --> 01:54.381
I probably should have
fucking designed a body suit.

01:54.381 --> 01:56.516
(laughing)
(snapping fingers)

01:56.516 --> 01:57.417
If you asked me, dead ass,

01:57.417 --> 01:58.785
did I think I was going to lip
sync?

01:58.785 --> 01:59.987
No I didn't,

01:59.987 --> 02:03.690
but that doesn't mean that
when she gets on stage, honey-

02:03.690 --> 02:05.926
- Yeah.
- She's gonna do it.

02:05.926 --> 02:06.760
(chuckles)

02:06.760 --> 02:08.595

see you perform, bitch,

02:08.595 --> 02:09.696
(Kendall laughing)

02:09.696 --> 02:10.530
and you did not disappoint.

02:10.530 --> 02:12.499
- At all.

02:12.499 --> 02:14.601
- We had that moment in between
our eyes where it was like,

02:14.601 --> 02:16.937
"Oh, bitch, I'm not, I'm
not giving half-ass."

02:16.937 --> 02:18.105
- Let's make some good TV.

02:18.105 --> 02:19.873
- She's like, "I'm going
to give you a hundred."

02:19.873 --> 02:21.508
And I was like, "I'm going to do
it too."

02:21.508 --> 02:23.210
This is what I do.

02:23.210 --> 02:26.113
I am showing them that
I deserve to be here

02:26.113 --> 02:27.781
and I want to be here.

02:27.781 --> 02:28.682
- Congrats.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.017
- Thank you.
- [Kimora] Congratulations.

02:30.017 --> 02:31.918

The race is heating up.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.990
It is no longer a jog,

02:36.990 --> 02:39.326
so I'm switching to my sprinting
shoes.

02:40.193 --> 02:43.497
- Well, bitches, I need to
get this mother fucking snake

02:43.497 --> 02:45.065
off this mother fucking body.

02:45.065 --> 02:46.600

02:46.600 --> 02:47.434
Let's do it.

02:48.402 --> 02:50.437

out of my fucking costume.

02:50.437 --> 02:51.838
(everyone laughs)

02:51.838 --> 02:54.041
Might as well just rip it open.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.977

02:56.977 --> 02:58.745
- Ew.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.480
It looks like I haven't slept.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.382
- [Icesis] We haven't. Let's be
real.

03:02.382 --> 03:05.419

Icesis's glamp shade look?

06:50.243 --> 06:53.546
Did it light you up or
did it turn you off?

06:53.546 --> 06:54.981
- You know, we do love yellow

06:54.981 --> 06:57.217
and usually I like to let that
mellow,

06:57.217 --> 07:00.587
but this bitch I'm going to
flush down the fucking toilet.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.655

07:01.655 --> 07:03.690
but she looks like a winner to
me.

07:03.690 --> 07:04.858

07:04.858 --> 07:06.793
Would you say she's
sophisticated?

07:06.793 --> 07:09.195
- Some may say, some may not.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.030
- Careful, bitch.

07:10.030 --> 07:10.864
(laughing)

07:10.864 --> 07:13.900
- T-t-tacky. Did I say that
already?

07:13.900 --> 07:14.934
- Girl.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.436
- Next girl.

better Holy Hell edition.

07:20.206 --> 07:22.742
Which reveal made you squeal?

07:22.742 --> 07:25.011
- That was predictable.

07:25.011 --> 07:27.747
- You know what, this is
very when you order it online

07:27.747 --> 07:28.915
and when it arrived.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.984

and where are the details,
Kendall?

07:37.157 --> 07:38.625

- Shady, shady lady.

- Let me tell you something
about Pythia.

all those no places, baby.

07:45.932 --> 07:47.901
Pythia wins. Hands down.

07:47.901 --> 07:51.705

is greater than her execution.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.039
Pythia, later.

feathers.

08:14.194 --> 08:17.063

board.

08:17.063 --> 08:18.598
- It's the first time her outfit

08:18.598 --> 08:20.200
has been louder than her mouth.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.136
- Next up, it's another
who wore it better.

08:23.136 --> 08:27.173
This time it's the queens
who stopped traffic.

08:27.173 --> 08:31.311
- Do not enter Pythia because
she is what? Sickening.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.380
She's on point if I might say.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.614
- She's got a cone head.

08:34.614 --> 08:36.950
It's a traffic do, not a traffic
don't.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.151
- [Gia] Exactly.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.419
- This old thing.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.354
- This bitch just keeps
on winning in all these

08:41.354 --> 08:42.188

08:42.188 --> 08:44.724
No big deal. That's totally
fine.

08:44.724 --> 08:45.992
(laughs)

08:45.992 --> 08:50.130
- Last up, we have Gia Metric's
premiere party eleganza?

08:51.331 --> 08:52.165
- [Both] Oh.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.501
- Well she's clearly
playing with fucking shapes

08:54.501 --> 08:55.568
and that's a rectangle.

08:55.568 --> 08:56.736
(laughs)

08:56.736 --> 08:58.705
- Definitely a choice.
- It is.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.541
- Look at her face. She's
not even convincing herself.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.942
- I'm in love with the hair
though.

09:02.942 --> 09:04.344
- Are you?

09:04.344 --> 09:05.178
- No.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.513
(laughs)

09:06.513 --> 09:08.782
- Well, that's all the
time we have for today.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.317
Thanks for watching. Say it with
me.

09:12.619 --> 09:15.822
- [Everyone] Fashion Puh-leeze!

09:17.524 --> 09:18.691
- That was great.

09:18.691 --> 09:21.027
We really are a trio.
- We are.

09:21.027 --> 09:22.162
- Who's the Beyonce?

09:24.030 --> 09:28.001
- Dolls, you were all
she-larious,

09:28.001 --> 09:30.603
but one of you was right on the
funny.

09:30.603 --> 09:35.608
The winner of this week's mini
challenge is Kendall Gender.

09:37.610 --> 09:41.047
- Oh, my God. Really?
(everyone cheers)

09:41.047 --> 09:41.915
Oh my God.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.485
What the fuck? Y'all said I was
basic.

09:45.485 --> 09:48.455
Who won the fashion
reading challenge, bitch?

09:48.455 --> 09:53.460
- You've won a $2.500 cash tip
courtesy of The Men's Room.

09:54.961 --> 09:57.363
(everyone cheers)

09:57.363 --> 09:59.432
- Thank you so much.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.935
- Now that you've burnt
each other to a crisp

10:01.935 --> 10:03.803
it's time for the main course.

10:03.803 --> 10:06.773
For this week's maxi challenge,

10:06.773 --> 10:09.409
we will be having a roast.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.478
(everyone laughs)

10:11.478 --> 10:13.746
- A comedy challenge.

10:13.746 --> 10:17.617
Even though I don't eat meat,
I am ready to roast, bitch.

10:17.617 --> 10:21.354
- And our guest of
dishonor is none other than

10:21.354 --> 10:24.357
Queen of the north, Brooke Lynn
Hytes.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.125
- Oh my God.
- Oh.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.395
- Oh no.

10:29.395 --> 10:32.432
- I love Brooke Lynn. I
don't want to roast her.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.701
- Oh, bitch.

10:34.701 --> 10:38.004
Brooke don't smile. The
bitch can't smile no more.

10:38.004 --> 10:40.073
So this gonna be difficult.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.308
- You'll be mentored by myself

10:42.308 --> 10:45.278
and the hilarious Emma Hunter.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.347
(cheers)

10:47.347 --> 10:50.917
- Thank God we have a comedy
specialist to help us.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.520
We're not comedy queens. None of
us.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.990
- And queens, everyone is
fair game for a cooking,

10:58.291 --> 11:00.393
so don't hold back.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.227
- I won't.

11:01.227 --> 11:04.297
- Kendall Gender, as winner
of the mini challenge,

11:04.297 --> 11:07.033
you will be choosing
the performance order.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.067
(whip cracks)

11:08.067 --> 11:10.703
Racers, start your engines

11:10.703 --> 11:13.206
and may the best drag queen win.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.241
(everyone cheers)

11:15.241 --> 11:17.877
(techno music)

11:17.877 --> 11:21.080
- So it is time to kind
of figure out what order

11:21.080 --> 11:23.683
everyone wants, what we're
thinking.

11:23.683 --> 11:24.884
- Where would you like to go?

11:24.884 --> 11:27.053
- I will say I do want to be the
first.

11:27.053 --> 11:27.987
- Oh.

11:27.987 --> 11:29.656
- Set the tone, set the mood.

11:29.656 --> 11:32.692
I'm kind of at the bottom of
the competition right now.

11:32.692 --> 11:36.896
This week is my time to prove
why they saved me last week

11:36.896 --> 11:40.033
and who the fuck Kendall Gender
is, bitch.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.768
I want to be number one.

11:41.768 --> 11:43.036
- I'm really shocked by Kendall.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.305
I know for sure I wouldn't like
to open.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.340
It's definitely the biggest
risk.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.776
- And two cognitive spots
are always at the beginning

11:49.776 --> 11:50.810
and the end.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.412
- I will say in my head,

11:52.412 --> 11:55.949
I was leaning towards
one of you at the end,

11:55.949 --> 11:57.350
just for like the strengths-
- Of course.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.751
- just for like the comedy chops

11:58.751 --> 12:01.354
and the kind of like delivery
and power.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.856
- It's flattering and
also probably conniving.

12:03.856 --> 12:06.092
This bitch probably has it out
for me.

12:06.092 --> 12:08.895
You're setting me up.
I know it. It's okay.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.997
It's a risk. I'll take it. I'll
take it.

12:10.997 --> 12:11.798
- [Kendall] You want to take it?

12:11.798 --> 12:12.632
- I'll take it.

12:12.632 --> 12:13.800
- Second up, we have Adriana.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.634
- Yo.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.302
- [Kendall] Third, we have Gia
Metric.

12:16.302 --> 12:17.136
- Me, me, me.

12:17.136 --> 12:20.273
- Fourth, we have Pythia and
then that would put you five.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.074
- Let's be honest.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.077
I'm probably just going to
be absolutely hilarious.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.946
So, girl, put me wherever. I got
it.

12:26.946 --> 12:29.482
- All right, bitches. Let's
get these jokes on a roll.

12:29.482 --> 12:30.316
- Woo!

12:34.354 --> 12:36.356
- I didn't realize how much
thought

12:36.356 --> 12:38.758
goes behind comedy routines.

12:38.758 --> 12:43.463
It is an art in itself that
I am not very well versed in.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.798
- You want to make sure
that not only you laugh,

12:45.798 --> 12:47.333
but everyone's laughing with you

12:47.333 --> 12:49.002
even though it's a little bit of
a dig.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.270
- Yeah and it doesn't cross that
line.

12:51.270 --> 12:54.540
- Right. That fine line,
and girl, that line is fine.

12:55.842 --> 12:57.777
- Is Poppers a brand?

12:57.777 --> 12:58.711
- I think you're good.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.980
- I've never written comedy.

13:00.980 --> 13:05.084
I rarely know how to do jokes in
English.

13:05.084 --> 13:09.622
This challenge is killing me.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.557
(dance music)

13:11.557 --> 13:12.392
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.293
- Hi.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.596
Now it's time for some
comedy coaching with Brad

13:16.596 --> 13:18.164
and Emma Hunter.

13:18.164 --> 13:20.299
She is one funny bitch.

13:20.299 --> 13:24.003
- Can I ask how the joke
writing has been going so far?

13:24.003 --> 13:26.706
- I think so far so good.

13:26.706 --> 13:28.675
I do host a lot of events,

13:28.675 --> 13:30.943
so I'm hoping that I can
kind of translate that

13:30.943 --> 13:32.845
into a comedy challenge.

13:32.845 --> 13:34.380
- Well can see what-
- Yeah.

13:34.380 --> 13:35.381
- You prepared? Is that okay?

13:35.381 --> 13:36.215
I can't wait to hear your
material.

13:36.215 --> 13:37.116
- Absolutely.

13:37.116 --> 13:38.985
Hello, bonjour, hi,

13:38.985 --> 13:41.454
and welcome to the roast
of Brooke Lynn Hytes.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.288
You know,

13:42.288 --> 13:45.591
sometimes I feel like they're
a little bit harsh on me,

13:45.591 --> 13:48.327
but I finally realized why.

13:48.327 --> 13:51.964
It's because out of drag I
kind of looked like Yvie Oddly.

13:51.964 --> 13:53.599
(laughs)

13:53.599 --> 13:55.468
God, that must be stressful for
you.

13:55.468 --> 13:58.571
The PTSD must be really real.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.506
It does kind of make me laugh
though.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.575
(laughs)

14:04.744 --> 14:07.146
(both clapping)

14:07.146 --> 14:09.082
- It doesn't sound as
good with only two people.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.450
I love your energy.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.453
I think it's exactly what
we're looking for in a roast.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.522
Because it's the first joke,
we're like taking you in,

14:16.522 --> 14:18.391
taking in your look, taking in
your vibe.

14:18.391 --> 14:19.792
So the faster you can get
to the punchline the better.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.627
- The funny
- Just for the first joke.

14:21.627 --> 14:22.462
Right?
- Yep.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.363
- And then we're like in like,
"Oh, funny. Okay, let's go."

14:24.363 --> 14:25.198
- [Kendall] Okay.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.032
- And then you have our trust.

14:26.032 --> 14:26.866
- Totally.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.336
Amanda Brugel, you know,
we were very thankful

14:30.336 --> 14:32.438
you took time out of your busy
schedule

14:32.438 --> 14:35.108
creating a show that only
50 year old white women

14:35.108 --> 14:39.078
actually watch to be with us
here tonight.

14:39.078 --> 14:43.249
- I think you can go a little
bit further.

14:43.249 --> 14:44.250
- Oh.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.385
- I don't know if it's roasty
enough,

14:46.385 --> 14:48.521
but your foundation is great.

14:48.521 --> 14:51.591
- You have sort of a sweet,
innocent face

14:51.591 --> 14:54.794
which lets you get away
with more rude stuff.

14:57.997 --> 14:59.832
- Hi.
- It's Adriana.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.101
- Soy yo.

15:02.101 --> 15:02.969
(Brad laughs)

15:02.969 --> 15:03.803
Hi.

15:03.803 --> 15:06.773
I know that I'm not the best
in improv. We've seen it.

15:06.773 --> 15:10.810
But I want the judges
to see that I am funny.

15:10.810 --> 15:13.212
I really want to surprise them.

15:13.212 --> 15:15.882
I want to start by thanking
Amanda for being here

15:15.882 --> 15:19.018
because otherwise I would
have felt in fucking Whoville

15:19.018 --> 15:21.154
or some Tim Burton, creepy white
shit.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.124
(nervously chuckles)

15:25.124 --> 15:29.829
Brad Goreski, the homosexual
mayor of Whoville,

15:29.829 --> 15:31.697
the gay poodle of bitches.

15:32.799 --> 15:36.269
I love how you make me feel
when you enter the room,

15:36.269 --> 15:39.539
that smell of Silicon lube,
poppers,

15:39.539 --> 15:43.042
and bad decisions just gets me
every time.

15:43.042 --> 15:47.113
- Okay. Hold on one sec.
I think we can start.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.314
- Yeah.
- Chit chatting.

15:48.314 --> 15:49.982
- It might be a good idea to get
some-

15:49.982 --> 15:51.784
- Yeah
- feedback.

15:51.784 --> 15:55.121
There's a couple of parts that
I think meander a little bit.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.989
We need that joke. We need that
meat.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.194
- Miss Brooke Lynn Hytes,

16:02.128 --> 16:04.797
the first time that I
saw her in the workroom,

16:04.797 --> 16:08.868
I thought for a minute that I
was competing in Dragula shit.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.504
She just came in and, "My
queens."

16:11.504 --> 16:12.538
Ah, the fuck.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.677
Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, good.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.046
Uh, fuck. Uh.

16:21.848 --> 16:26.586
- Remember, and I'm saying
this because I love Adriana,

16:26.586 --> 16:28.521
she's so gorgeous and confident,

16:28.521 --> 16:32.058
remember that who's
delivering this roast, right?

16:32.058 --> 16:35.328
So don't forget her
spirit in there as well.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.262
- Thank you so much.

16:36.262 --> 16:40.566
- Thank you very much. Adriana.
Bless.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.904
- Kimora Amour.

16:46.205 --> 16:47.206
So how do you feel?

16:47.206 --> 16:50.443
- I am a nervous public speaker.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.277
- Oh.

16:51.277 --> 16:54.480
- But I love comedy.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.782
If there is any challenge for me
to win,

16:56.782 --> 16:58.851
I feel like it's this one.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.152
- Let's see what you got.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.587
- So I'm starting with thanking
Icesis

17:01.587 --> 17:04.724
cause she is the one that is
before me.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.093
For all of you that don't know
Icesis,

17:07.093 --> 17:09.562
bitch complains about
everything.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.765
Almost like she's a
rapper, my neck, my back.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.867
Girl, if she had an ass,

17:14.867 --> 17:16.736
we'd be talking about her crack
too.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.704
- Yes! (cheers)

17:18.704 --> 17:19.906
And we're off.

17:19.906 --> 17:23.976
- That's funny. Did you cut
out "pussy" for a reason?

17:23.976 --> 17:24.944
- Yeah.
- [Brad] Okay.

17:24.944 --> 17:25.778
- Because I didn't,

17:25.778 --> 17:27.113
I wasn't too sure if
I'm allowed to say it.

17:27.113 --> 17:29.849
- You can say "pussy," so you
can actually make it funnier.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.884
- Okay.
- [Brad] I think.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.286
- I love pussy.

17:35.321 --> 17:36.856
- You already have great energy,

17:36.856 --> 17:38.925
but remember what we
said about Snatch Game

17:38.925 --> 17:40.026
about nuances too.

17:40.026 --> 17:42.962
- Yes. I just need to
get the flow, the rhythm.

17:42.962 --> 17:47.166
My concept for this is hit
'em hard and hit 'em quick.

17:47.166 --> 17:50.703
Pythia, bitch is so
Greek she shits yogurt.

17:50.703 --> 17:51.804
(laughs)

17:51.804 --> 17:53.506
Baby, you wanna be Muhammad Ali
out there,

17:53.506 --> 17:56.208
float like a butterfly
and sting like a bee.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.276
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:57.276 --> 17:59.078
- Oh my gosh. Hi.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.247
I like to think of
myself as a funny person,

18:01.247 --> 18:04.650
but I've never done a
roast or live comedy,

18:04.650 --> 18:05.885
so the pressure's on.

18:05.885 --> 18:09.822
What a wonderful crowd. It makes
them feel very appreciated.

18:09.822 --> 18:10.656
(nervously chuckles)

18:10.656 --> 18:12.158
Oh yeah, did I mention,

18:12.158 --> 18:14.327
this is my very first time doing
this.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.062
I bet Brooke can't remember the
last time

18:16.062 --> 18:17.129
she said those words.

18:17.129 --> 18:18.731
(giggles)

18:18.731 --> 18:19.765
- Do you get that?

18:19.765 --> 18:22.101
- Wait, I'm going to say it
in Greek. Maybe it's funnier.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.836
(speaks Greek)

18:23.836 --> 18:27.273
No? Okay. You're a ho is what
I'm saying.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.410
Ah, cool.

18:31.410 --> 18:34.313
Damn, your blonde wigs are
really seeping in, aren't they?

18:35.147 --> 18:36.716
Um, cool.

18:36.716 --> 18:39.585
- I wouldn't start with
the 'I'm not good at this'

18:39.585 --> 18:41.020
or 'this is my first time.'

18:41.020 --> 18:44.357
There's a thing sometimes
with roasts, comedy stuff,

18:44.357 --> 18:45.191
where people go,

18:45.191 --> 18:46.592
"I'm really nervous or
I hope this goes well,"

18:46.592 --> 18:48.494
and everybody goes, "Oh, fuck,
this is going to be bad."

18:48.494 --> 18:49.328
- Yeah.

18:49.328 --> 18:50.162
- So don't let us "eh."

18:50.162 --> 18:52.031
Just tell, "I'm amazing.
It's going to be so funny."

18:52.031 --> 18:54.033
You know, just get to it.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.769
- Up next, the queen who fell
in the discount BDSM rack

18:56.769 --> 18:59.405
of a sex shop and won a design
challenge.

18:59.405 --> 19:02.174
She's a true testament that
anyone can make it these days,

19:02.174 --> 19:03.009
Icesis Couture.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.944
- I love it.
- Great.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.545
- Discount rack. Yes.
I love it. I love it.

19:06.545 --> 19:08.748
- Yeah, you should have
seen her look last week.

19:08.748 --> 19:09.582
You wouldn't have loved it.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.350
- Do I sense a little shade?

19:11.350 --> 19:12.852
- A little, a little bit.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.987
- Listen, girl, throw it into
your roast.

19:16.022 --> 19:16.856
Ah.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.858
- Ah. She has arrived.

19:18.858 --> 19:19.692
(laughing)

19:19.692 --> 19:23.562
- Oh, she is arrived. It's
Icesis Couture.

19:23.562 --> 19:26.499
- How did you find the
process of writing jokes?

19:26.499 --> 19:27.700
- I just looked around the room

19:27.700 --> 19:29.769
and realized how terrible
everybody was.

19:29.769 --> 19:30.936
- Oh, shade.

19:30.936 --> 19:32.304
- Oh, we're starting early.

19:32.304 --> 19:33.572
- Oh my goodness.
- What.

19:33.572 --> 19:34.507
- It's getting hot.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.341
(Icesis laughs)

19:35.341 --> 19:38.878
- Welcome again to the roast
of Miss Brooke Lynn Hytes.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.446
Brooke, as in the face.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.848
Lynn, as in that's a lot of fill
in.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.483
Mother, blink.

19:44.483 --> 19:47.219
One blink for moisture.
Two blinks for help.

19:48.888 --> 19:53.125
Yeah? No? Is that- no.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.428
- I would not do individual
parts of her name,

19:55.428 --> 19:57.897
but like Brooke Lynn Hytes,
the blankety blank of blank.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.166
- Okay.
- Or go after something else,

20:00.166 --> 20:02.368
her makeup, her songs-

20:02.368 --> 20:03.235
- So I'm gonna skip that.

20:03.235 --> 20:04.937
- [Emma] Yeah.
- Okay.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.605
Um, I kid, I kid.

20:06.605 --> 20:08.841
Mother, you are the absolute
beauty,

20:08.841 --> 20:12.812
and as the fairytale goes,
we have beauty and the beast.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.980
And I point towards the sisters.

20:14.980 --> 20:17.049
Please follow my hand
as I direct your eyes

20:17.049 --> 20:18.617
to the dog show to my right.

20:19.885 --> 20:24.990
I'm slightly nervous because
they weren't really laughing.

20:24.990 --> 20:25.825
Is that too mean?

20:25.825 --> 20:28.260
- No.
- I'm not sure I follow.

20:28.260 --> 20:29.795
- I don't want my cardio
tomorrow

20:29.795 --> 20:32.198
to be me trying to find
my way to your punchline.

20:32.198 --> 20:33.065
- Okay?
- For sure.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.634
- This is like, boom, boom,
boom. Get out.

20:35.634 --> 20:37.403
It's just a massive thing with
time

20:37.403 --> 20:39.371
because you're going
to take some time away

20:39.371 --> 20:40.272
from your sister.

20:40.272 --> 20:42.274
- Yeah. I need to edit. For
sure.

20:42.274 --> 20:45.144
It's definitely going to be a
long night.

20:45.144 --> 20:48.547
- There she is. Gia Metric.

20:48.547 --> 20:49.548
- Hi.

20:49.548 --> 20:53.719
This is my first time reading
jokes that I have written

20:53.719 --> 20:57.656
and I'm definitely outside
of my comfort zone.

20:57.656 --> 21:01.460
So my entrance line is,
"Who brought the gravy?

21:01.460 --> 21:03.295
Just kidding, girls. I'm here."

21:04.196 --> 21:05.030
- Okay. That's cute.
- Okay.

21:05.030 --> 21:06.298
- Calling myself the gravy.

21:06.298 --> 21:07.133
- [Brad] Okay.

21:07.133 --> 21:10.302
- We have for, um, for Brad, we
have.

21:11.203 --> 21:13.539
Brad, you're like the corn on
the cob.

21:13.539 --> 21:16.542
I'd love to butter you up,
sprinkle some sugar on you,

21:16.542 --> 21:19.578
and scream, "Yes, Daddy,
give me all your money."

21:19.578 --> 21:21.013
(laughs)

21:21.013 --> 21:22.448
No. Okay.

21:23.382 --> 21:25.918
- First of all, who puts sugar
on corn?

21:25.918 --> 21:27.820
- I was making like a
sugar daddy reference.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.221
- Oh. (laughs)

21:29.221 --> 21:32.992
I was out at sugar. That's not a
roast.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.160
What else do you have?

21:34.160 --> 21:36.562
- Um, Okay.

21:36.562 --> 21:38.297
Emma, you're like the aunt who
shows up,

21:38.297 --> 21:41.000
but no one knows what side
of the family you belong to.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.735
You can sit with the kids
tonight.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.205
No? (chuckles)

21:46.205 --> 21:47.439
- This is what I think your
thing is,

21:47.439 --> 21:48.974
you don't think you're a joke
writer,

21:48.974 --> 21:50.309
so you don't want to write the
jokes.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.946
- I think I'm struggling with
being mean.

21:53.946 --> 21:57.283
When I was younger, I had
a lot of like anger issues.

21:57.283 --> 22:00.819
I did not like the way that
I was treating other people.

22:00.819 --> 22:05.424
And I've worked so hard to
like push away from like

22:05.424 --> 22:07.326
being this mean person.

22:07.326 --> 22:11.297
I feel like this is like
the most shaky I've been

22:11.297 --> 22:12.131
in the competition.

22:12.131 --> 22:12.965
- Oh.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.533
- This is like the challenge

22:14.533 --> 22:16.669
that I knew was going to
be the toughest for me.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.205
- You're a queen and you have
confidence

22:19.205 --> 22:20.839
and every time you start telling
a joke,

22:20.839 --> 22:22.174
I feel like you shrink back.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.677
Fuck it. Who cares? Just bring
it.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.478
- Now is like make or break
time.

22:26.478 --> 22:28.514
And you've got it all in you,

22:28.514 --> 22:31.016
so like step your fucking pussy
up

22:31.016 --> 22:32.484
and write us a good roast.

22:32.484 --> 22:33.319
- Gotcha.

22:33.319 --> 22:36.088
- And wear a leotard with two
legs.

22:36.088 --> 22:38.457
(laughs)

22:38.457 --> 22:42.061
(dance music)
(screams)

22:42.061 --> 22:44.763
- It's elimination day
and it is roast day,

22:44.763 --> 22:48.200
and I feel medium rare.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.471
- Do you guys feel like
when you get in drag,

22:52.471 --> 22:56.242
you have this sort of like
power of like a thousand people,

22:56.242 --> 22:57.076
you know what I mean?

22:57.076 --> 22:58.911
Like you're this sort of
presence.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.212
- Oh yeah. Absolutely.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.580
- It's becoming a superhero.

23:01.580 --> 23:03.482
- Yes, exactly. You're
becoming a superhero.

23:03.482 --> 23:05.217
- This is part of like why I do
drag

23:05.217 --> 23:07.253
and the reason why I named
myself after such like

23:07.253 --> 23:09.421
a respected figure in my
culture.

23:09.421 --> 23:13.225
Back home in Greece, being a
feminine person is very taboo

23:13.225 --> 23:15.995
especially as someone who is
more masculine presenting.

23:15.995 --> 23:19.832
And for me to claim that name
is a way to sort of own back

23:19.832 --> 23:21.734
that femininity that
was taken away from me

23:21.734 --> 23:22.768
as a young child.

23:22.768 --> 23:25.137
- You know, when you're put down
so much

23:25.137 --> 23:27.006
for like being who you are,

23:27.006 --> 23:29.308
the moment that we get to create
something

23:29.308 --> 23:31.543
and like be the writer, be the
director,

23:31.543 --> 23:33.245
and be the star of it.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.813
It's so empowering.

23:34.813 --> 23:35.648
- Mhmm.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.216
- I would say the only
struggle to that sometimes

23:37.216 --> 23:38.984
is like then getting out of
drag.

23:38.984 --> 23:39.918
- [Pythia] Yeah.

23:39.918 --> 23:40.753
- And feeling inadequate. Yeah.

23:40.753 --> 23:41.987
- [Gia] Yeah, girl.

23:41.987 --> 23:45.424
- There's like this social
pressure in the gay community

23:45.424 --> 23:48.260
not being hunk enough,
not being skinny enough.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.795
- Yeah.
- [Gia] Yeah, yeah.

23:49.795 --> 23:51.063
- It takes a toll

23:51.063 --> 23:56.035
because that idea that you're
not enough to be a gay man.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.370
You're too fat. You're too fem.

23:58.370 --> 24:00.039
You're too this. You're too
that.

24:00.039 --> 24:03.275
It's difficult because when
I'm Kimora, baby, I'm a storm.

24:03.275 --> 24:07.513
Out of drag, I am probably
just a really big nerd.

24:07.513 --> 24:11.083
Justin is very quiet and
reserved.

24:11.083 --> 24:14.787
And Kimora is this out of the
world person

24:14.787 --> 24:16.889
who is like my alter ego.

24:16.889 --> 24:19.058
- No matter what like that
power that we have in drag

24:19.058 --> 24:20.993
is available to us out of drag
too.

24:20.993 --> 24:21.827
- [Kimora] It is.
- Yeah.

24:21.827 --> 24:23.429
- Cause we are that
person, no matter what.

24:23.429 --> 24:24.530
Maybe not physically,

24:24.530 --> 24:27.066
maybe we don't have like
30 pounds of makeup on

24:27.066 --> 24:29.201
and like two stacked wigs.

24:29.201 --> 24:31.036
But like, you know, we
still have that power.

24:31.036 --> 24:32.771
- [Icesis] I do enjoy 30 pounds
of makeup.

24:32.771 --> 24:33.772
- [Pythia] We know.

24:33.772 --> 24:35.140
(both laughing)

24:35.140 --> 24:39.645
- Well, bitches, thank God drag
has given us some tough skin

24:39.645 --> 24:41.847
and baby, when we roast,

24:41.847 --> 24:44.149
I hope Brooke Lynn has
just as toughest skin

24:44.149 --> 24:46.251
because we going to
eat her the fuck alive.

24:46.251 --> 24:47.419
- She does.
- Yes.

24:47.419 --> 24:48.854
- Have you seen her up close?

24:48.854 --> 24:51.690
(everyone laughs)

25:08.707 --> 25:12.111
♪ Cover girl, put the bass in
your walk ♪

25:12.111 --> 25:15.681
♪ Head to toe, let your whole
body talk ♪

25:15.681 --> 25:16.615
(clapping)

25:16.615 --> 25:19.885
- Welcome to the main stage
of Canada's Drag Race.

25:19.885 --> 25:23.522
She's always got a plan and
she'll always take your man.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.525
It's TV's Amanda Brugel.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.760
- Under his eye.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.861
- Which one?

25:29.828 --> 25:30.763
- That one.

25:30.763 --> 25:31.663
(Brooke laughs)

25:31.663 --> 25:35.934
- He's the only man suited to
be here. It's Brad Goreski.

25:35.934 --> 25:37.002
- Hi, Brooke Lynn.

25:37.002 --> 25:38.537
- Brad, have you ever had a
roast?

25:38.537 --> 25:40.739
- Oh, I love a good rump roast.

25:40.739 --> 25:42.608
- Oh, what about a spit roast?

25:42.608 --> 25:45.077
- Oh, I don't think I've
ever had one of those.

25:45.077 --> 25:46.979
- That really surprises me.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.347
- Me too.

25:48.347 --> 25:52.084
- And it's Canada's
funny honey, Emma Hunter.

25:52.084 --> 25:52.918
- Hi.

25:52.918 --> 25:54.653
- How hard do those queens make
you laugh?

25:54.653 --> 25:56.889
- So hard that I peed a little.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.091
In fact, I'm peeing right now.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.294
- This week, we challenged our
queens

26:02.294 --> 26:04.696
to heat up the competition
in the first ever

26:04.696 --> 26:07.599
Canada's Drag Race roast of me.

26:08.934 --> 26:13.672
Racers, start your engines and
may the best drag queen win.

26:16.108 --> 26:19.978
(jazzy game show music)
(applause)

26:19.978 --> 26:22.948
First up, Kendall Gender.

26:22.948 --> 26:25.284
- Hello, bonjour, hi,

26:25.284 --> 26:28.353
and welcome to the roast
of Brooke Lynn Hytes.

26:28.353 --> 26:30.389
Let's say hello to our judges.

26:30.389 --> 26:31.857
(Brad laughs)
(applause)

26:31.857 --> 26:32.858
Hi, Emma.

26:32.858 --> 26:33.692
- Hi.

26:33.692 --> 26:35.594
- Oh my god, Emma, did
you know that this week

26:35.594 --> 26:38.030
I actually won the mini
challenge?

26:38.030 --> 26:38.864
It's true.

26:38.864 --> 26:41.300
It was this really
intense acting challenge

26:41.300 --> 26:43.602
where I had to pretend to
actually know who the fuck

26:43.602 --> 26:45.771
you were when they said
you were a judge this week.

26:45.771 --> 26:46.605
(laughter)

26:46.605 --> 26:50.609
I know. I was all like, "Ah, and
scene."

26:50.609 --> 26:52.511
(laughter)

26:52.511 --> 26:54.379
And hello, Wendy Williams.

26:54.379 --> 26:55.614
(laughter)

26:55.614 --> 26:56.882
So happy to see you.

26:56.882 --> 27:01.954
My goodness, I mean,
Amanda Brugel. My bad.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.589
Must be all those bodysuits I
wear

27:03.589 --> 27:06.358
they really cut off the
circulation to the brain.

27:06.358 --> 27:07.459
(laughter)

27:07.459 --> 27:09.428
I am just so happy that you took
time

27:09.428 --> 27:11.797
out of your busy schedule
of creating a show

27:11.797 --> 27:14.433
that only 50 year old
white women actually watch

27:14.433 --> 27:15.634
to be with us today.

27:15.634 --> 27:16.668
(laughter)

27:16.668 --> 27:19.905
Speaking of 50 year old
white women, hi Brad.

27:19.905 --> 27:21.807
- Hi!
(laughter)

27:21.807 --> 27:23.642
- Oh my God, Kendall, work.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.911
She is on fire.

27:25.911 --> 27:28.313
- Brad is a fashion stylist.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.315
It basically means that
he's not talented enough

27:30.315 --> 27:31.617
to be a fashion designer,

27:31.617 --> 27:34.720
and yet he's too ugly to
be an actual celebrity.

27:34.720 --> 27:35.554
- [Emma] Aww.

27:35.554 --> 27:38.991
- Did you know that Brad
is actually my middle name?

27:38.991 --> 27:40.459
- No.
- I know.

27:40.459 --> 27:43.495
Ugh, I'm sorry for that
useless bit of information,

27:43.495 --> 27:46.064
almost as useless as
getting a makeup critique

27:46.064 --> 27:47.900
from a drag queen that
doesn't even paint her own

27:47.900 --> 27:49.635
fucking face.

27:49.635 --> 27:50.536
(laughter)

27:50.536 --> 27:51.370
Brooke Lynn Hytes, everybody!

27:55.040 --> 27:58.677
When we were getting an
explanation about this whole
roast,

27:58.677 --> 28:01.346
they were like, "The roast is
going to be about the icon,

28:01.346 --> 28:05.117
the legend, the star,
the Queen of the North."

28:05.117 --> 28:08.420
And I like everyone assumed
that meant Priyanka.

28:08.420 --> 28:09.888
(laughter)

28:09.888 --> 28:11.323
But no, no.

28:11.323 --> 28:13.792
They meant the queen that
gave herself that title

28:13.792 --> 28:16.895
instead of actually
winning the fucking crown.

28:16.895 --> 28:18.463
(laughter)

28:18.463 --> 28:20.832
(jazzy game show music)
- Ooh.

28:20.832 --> 28:23.268
- Speaking of people
will never win the crown,

28:23.268 --> 28:26.939
please prepare yourself for
the mediocre comedic stylings

28:26.939 --> 28:28.607
of Adriana.

28:28.607 --> 28:30.842
(applause)

28:31.877 --> 28:33.579
- It is an honor to be here

28:33.579 --> 28:36.915
to do some juicy Brooke
Lynn Hytes cooking.

28:36.915 --> 28:38.650
Yes, hmm.

28:38.650 --> 28:41.153
We have very special guests
tonight,

28:41.153 --> 28:46.158
but I want to start by
thanking our adorable- sorry.

28:48.226 --> 28:50.796
I want to start by thanking
our more affordable,

28:50.796 --> 28:54.199
but not less lovable Michelle
Visage, Amanda Brugel.

28:55.233 --> 28:56.201
Because without you,

28:56.201 --> 28:59.171
this panel would be whiter
than Pythia's dancing.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.607
(laughter)

29:01.607 --> 29:05.177
Brooke Lynn, I see so
much of myself in you.

29:05.177 --> 29:09.681
I mean, you're quiet, beautiful,
but still a fucking bitch.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.585
You told me last week that
you saw my versatility,

29:13.585 --> 29:15.721
but were are you blind the whole
season?

29:15.721 --> 29:18.857
I've never topped and
bottomed so hard in my life.

29:18.857 --> 29:19.691
(laughter)

29:19.691 --> 29:23.695
I mean, I'm sure you have,
Brad, but no, I haven't.

29:23.695 --> 29:25.330
And it hurt.

29:25.330 --> 29:29.468
I am like Synthia, Kendall,
and Gia's trio, just destroyed.

29:29.468 --> 29:31.703
(laughter)

29:33.338 --> 29:34.673
Back to Trinity The Tuck.

29:34.673 --> 29:35.507
(Brooke laughs)

29:35.507 --> 29:39.244
You are an icon, a role model,
just judging these bitches

29:39.244 --> 29:42.347
and looking like the youngest
fucking cock destroyer.

29:42.347 --> 29:44.616
(laughter)

29:44.616 --> 29:47.052
Those are mother fucking goals.

29:47.052 --> 29:49.855
(applause)
(jazzy game show music)

29:49.855 --> 29:51.523
- What's up, y'all? What's up?

29:51.523 --> 29:55.794
My name is Gia Metric.
Take in this beauty, honey.

29:58.196 --> 30:01.600
I am painted. I am snatched.

30:01.600 --> 30:05.270
The tape is tight. Brooke Lynn,
take note.

30:05.270 --> 30:08.640
Last week, I saw your
tape flapping in the wind.

30:08.640 --> 30:13.645
We don't want that. That's
all we're going to say. Yes.

30:13.879 --> 30:17.315
Now, one thing I like
to say about my beauty

30:17.315 --> 30:19.618
is that it does not make me
funny,

30:19.618 --> 30:23.021
but it sure gets me a
lot of dick, bitches.

30:23.021 --> 30:25.190
(Gia cheers)
(laughter)

30:25.190 --> 30:27.392
I have had so many dicks in my
mouth.

30:27.392 --> 30:29.594
(clears throat)

30:29.594 --> 30:32.831
- Gia is on the struggle bus.

30:32.831 --> 30:36.034
- She gags, but does it feel
good.

30:36.034 --> 30:39.805
- Hell no. I'm not buying
a ticket to that show.

30:39.805 --> 30:43.442
I am scared. I want to
go home. I need an adult.

30:43.442 --> 30:48.447
- And now the guest of
honor, Brooke Lynn Hytes.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.850
Let's talk about your face.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.786
Oh, pardon me, your new face.

30:54.786 --> 30:55.787
- Thank you.
(laughter)

30:55.787 --> 30:59.291
- It reminds me of one of
those pussy cat wall clocks

30:59.291 --> 31:01.093
made of cheap, hard plastic,

31:01.093 --> 31:04.730
and all that moves are
those wonky shifty eyes.

31:04.730 --> 31:06.698
It's like, did you smell burnt
toast?

31:10.135 --> 31:12.270
- The claws are out, mama.

31:12.270 --> 31:13.972
- You old, bitch.

31:13.972 --> 31:17.509
Your face is so stiff if I had a
rock,

31:17.509 --> 31:20.479
we can knock them together to
make a fire.

31:22.414 --> 31:26.952
Then we could actually get
this roast cooking. Am I right?

31:27.819 --> 31:29.755
(applause)

31:29.755 --> 31:32.724
- Thank you. Thank you so
much for the warm welcome.

31:32.724 --> 31:33.558
I'm Greek, right?

31:33.558 --> 31:36.228
So when I heard roast, I
thought like the whole Greek,

31:36.228 --> 31:37.162
Easter shebang,

31:37.162 --> 31:39.498
and we saw the grease
paint on a guest judge,

31:39.498 --> 31:40.432
it might as well be.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.501
(laughter)

31:42.501 --> 31:45.771
Us drag queens, we have a
lot of cover-up techniques,

31:45.771 --> 31:48.306
so ask us for some tips if you
need.

31:48.306 --> 31:49.574
Just don't ask Adriana.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.844
Yeah, she's a little
rough. A little though.

31:55.447 --> 31:57.048
Let's see.

31:57.048 --> 32:01.453
And the honored guest of the
night, Miss Brooke Lynn Hytes.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.255
Bitch, I am so scared to roast
you

32:03.255 --> 32:04.689
in this environmental crisis

32:04.689 --> 32:07.592
because what if the ozone
layer makes more holes

32:07.592 --> 32:09.528
with all the chemicals burning
off?

32:10.529 --> 32:12.397
It's so hard to take
advice from her sometimes

32:12.397 --> 32:14.800
because her face doesn't move.

32:14.800 --> 32:18.370
She's like, "Make me laugh."

32:19.938 --> 32:20.806
- I'm still waiting.

32:20.806 --> 32:22.340
(laughter)

32:22.340 --> 32:26.278
- I know. I'm like, I'm
like- (nervously chuckles)

32:26.278 --> 32:28.146
You're not laughing? Well, you
know what?

32:28.146 --> 32:29.948
We weren't laughing with
your snatch game, either.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.117
(laughter)

32:32.117 --> 32:35.520
Celine Dion, more like Celine,
be gone.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.789
Anyways, I believe we
are running out of time,

32:37.789 --> 32:39.691
so give it up for Icesis
Couture.

32:39.691 --> 32:41.927
(applause)

32:44.162 --> 32:45.096
- [Amanda] Oh.
- Hey.

32:45.964 --> 32:50.702
- Thank you so much, Pythia,
for that hilarious roast.

32:50.702 --> 32:53.138
Since we're roasting, I'm
going to try one on you.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.639
Are you ready?

32:54.639 --> 32:59.244
Pythia, you're this week's
design challenge winner.

32:59.244 --> 33:01.479
(laughter)

33:03.348 --> 33:04.182
- Oh my God.

33:04.182 --> 33:06.952
Tell me how bad of a designer
I am. Tell me. I want it.

33:06.952 --> 33:10.589
- A wide lens and a warning
would really help out this cast.

33:10.589 --> 33:12.257
(laughter)

33:12.257 --> 33:15.193
Could you imagine this pack
of bulldog looking heifers

33:15.193 --> 33:17.095
running around loose in the
world?

33:17.996 --> 33:20.599
They are the reason we
spay and neuter our pets.

33:20.599 --> 33:22.133
(laughter)

33:22.133 --> 33:24.269
But enough about the cast of
Snow Dogs

33:24.269 --> 33:26.338
and Kimora as Cuba Gooding Jr.

33:26.338 --> 33:29.007
(laughter)

33:29.007 --> 33:30.408
Bay-ba-bay-bay.

33:30.408 --> 33:32.644
(laughter)

33:35.647 --> 33:37.449
Now to the judges.

33:37.449 --> 33:41.119
Brad, not only are you
an accomplished designer,

33:41.119 --> 33:43.655
you're also a wonderful author.

33:43.655 --> 33:48.026
The book was called Born to be
Brad.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.595
Let's all pause for the sheer
genius

33:50.595 --> 33:53.031
that is the title of that book.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.799
Just think about it.

33:54.799 --> 33:58.703
He was like born and then named
like Brad,

33:58.703 --> 34:01.673
so he was like born to be Brad.

34:03.074 --> 34:05.310
(laughter)

34:07.345 --> 34:10.982
Emma Hunter, the host of Pop
Quiz.

34:10.982 --> 34:13.952
Since Emma seems to enjoy
playing games,

34:13.952 --> 34:15.453
let's play one ourselves.

34:15.453 --> 34:17.923
I'll give you all five seconds
to Google

34:17.923 --> 34:20.458
"who the fuck is Emma Hunter?"

34:20.458 --> 34:21.426
(laughter)

34:21.426 --> 34:25.397
The winner gets Emma Hunter.
You're welcome, Emma.

34:25.397 --> 34:29.067
I hope your stay here was
comfortable, whoever you are.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.503
(jazzy game show music)
(applause)

34:31.503 --> 34:33.538
- That bitch is funny.

34:33.538 --> 34:35.373
- I'm fucking good at this.

34:35.373 --> 34:37.008
(laughter)

34:37.008 --> 34:39.811
- Girl, you're not even
getting to Brooke Lynn

34:39.811 --> 34:41.613
in a roast about Brooke Lynn?

34:41.613 --> 34:45.717
(Icesis speaking Spanish)

34:45.717 --> 34:48.987
Where are the Brooke Lynn jokes?

34:48.987 --> 34:51.323
- Now to the man of the hour.

34:51.323 --> 34:52.357
- [Producer] Wrap it up. Wrap it
up.

34:52.357 --> 34:55.060
- That raw throated dumpster
fire of a monstrosity

34:55.060 --> 34:58.496
you called Celine is almost
as bad as that cock destroyer

34:58.496 --> 35:00.665
of a throat you used to sing
that single.

35:00.665 --> 35:02.434
(laughter)

35:02.434 --> 35:07.405
Ra-tee-tee-tah. Oh? I'm done?
Oh, no.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.274
Oh my God. And we're done?

35:09.274 --> 35:11.876
I have two more pages.

35:11.876 --> 35:14.713
I just want to do in the rest my
jokes.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.514
Thank you so much.

35:16.514 --> 35:17.549
(applause)

35:17.549 --> 35:19.851
- Icesis went over her fucking
time.

35:19.851 --> 35:22.721
Light was blinking,
bitch. Light was blinking.

35:22.721 --> 35:25.857
Thank you, Icesis Couture.

35:25.857 --> 35:28.259
For all of you who don't know
Icesis,

35:28.259 --> 35:32.864
she is the mother fucking
grumpiest drag queen ever.

35:32.864 --> 35:37.135
This bitch complains about
pain like no one's business.

35:37.135 --> 35:40.205
She thinks she's like a
rapper from the year 2000.

35:40.205 --> 35:42.207
My neck. My back.

35:43.108 --> 35:44.876
If this bitch had an ass,

35:44.876 --> 35:47.212
we'd be hearing about her
pussy and her crack too.

35:47.212 --> 35:50.081
(laughter)

35:50.081 --> 35:53.785
Speaking of sisters,
Kendall Gender is here.

35:53.785 --> 35:57.622
If Drake in drag is your
fantasy, look no further.

35:57.622 --> 36:00.325
(laughter)

36:00.325 --> 36:03.628
Adriana, do you understand the
words

36:03.628 --> 36:05.363
that are coming out of my mouth?

36:05.363 --> 36:07.832
- No.
- See, you fucking suck.

36:09.801 --> 36:11.036
- That was mean.

36:11.036 --> 36:12.604
- And now our panel.

36:12.604 --> 36:13.438
- Oh God.

36:13.438 --> 36:14.973
- Stacy McKenzie is here.

36:14.973 --> 36:17.776
(laughter)

36:17.776 --> 36:20.311
What? Amanda Brugel?

36:20.311 --> 36:22.013
From that show with the
bitches with the hoods?

36:22.013 --> 36:23.214
Oh, I'm not fucking with her.

36:23.214 --> 36:24.616
(laughter)

36:24.616 --> 36:26.751
Brad Goreski, everyone.

36:26.751 --> 36:29.120
Brad, I'd ask who you're
wearing,

36:29.120 --> 36:31.256
but it's clear to me
that you're being dressed

36:31.256 --> 36:33.224
by little trolls made of candy

36:33.224 --> 36:36.561
because every time fucking I
look at you,

36:36.561 --> 36:38.696
I taste the fucking rainbow.

36:39.964 --> 36:41.933
And now for the maid of honor,

36:41.933 --> 36:46.204
first runner-up to Yvie
Oddly, Miss Brooke Lynn Hytes.

36:46.204 --> 36:50.975
Brooke, I have to thank you
for setting the bar so low

36:50.975 --> 36:51.976
on snatch game.

36:52.911 --> 36:56.247
But, really, all jokes aside,
Brooke,

36:56.247 --> 36:59.017
you are the pride and joy of
Canada.

36:59.017 --> 36:59.851
- Aw.

36:59.851 --> 37:00.685
- It's a shame

37:00.685 --> 37:03.888
it took 15 CCS of hieratic acid

37:03.888 --> 37:06.458
for you to look this fucking
stunning.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.526
Bitch, let me tell you
something.

37:08.526 --> 37:12.764
Your face is fucking full
like a bottom in a bath house.

37:13.731 --> 37:15.767
- Oh.
- Wow. Okay.

37:15.767 --> 37:16.768
Watching Kimora,

37:16.768 --> 37:21.339
this is just like definitely
not what I expected.

37:21.339 --> 37:23.241
- I am Kimora Amour

37:23.241 --> 37:26.344
and I am here in the
same mother fucking hair.

37:26.344 --> 37:29.681
Why? Because I fucking bought
it.

37:29.681 --> 37:32.484
Good night. Thank you very much.

37:32.484 --> 37:35.653
And this was the roast of
Miss Brooke Lynn Hytes.

37:35.653 --> 37:39.624
(laughter)
(applause)

37:39.624 --> 37:41.292
(techno music)

37:41.292 --> 37:45.396
- Category is Dungeons and Drag
Queens.

37:45.396 --> 37:47.565
First up, Gia Metric.

37:47.565 --> 37:52.537
Oh, it's Lizard McGuire. She
is serving you lizard queen.

37:53.438 --> 37:55.807
Watch out because her tail might
trip ya.

37:55.807 --> 37:58.243
This look is one in a chameleon.

37:58.243 --> 37:59.878
- I'm taking it slow

37:59.878 --> 38:03.181
and letting them know
that I have nowhere to be

38:03.181 --> 38:04.949
but right here.

38:04.949 --> 38:07.485
- [Brooke Lynn] Next up,
Adriana.

38:07.485 --> 38:10.155
- Ooh, creature from the gay
lagoon.

38:10.155 --> 38:14.259
- I'm walking that runway
giving you old couture fashion.

38:14.259 --> 38:17.495
This mix of insect, animal,
fish.

38:17.495 --> 38:22.500
This weird mix with beauty
and I feel fantastic.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.671
- She's really fishing for
compliments with this one.

38:26.671 --> 38:28.640
- [Brooke Lynn] Icesis Couture.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.075
- I am THE evil queen.

38:31.075 --> 38:33.978
- Introducing her Royal
Vag-esty.

38:33.978 --> 38:34.812
(Brooke Lynn laughs)

38:34.812 --> 38:37.949
- I am wearing a custom
crown that I made myself.

38:37.949 --> 38:41.085
I want the judges to know
what it would look like

38:41.085 --> 38:42.854
when they put the crown on my
head.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.455
- Mirror, mirror, on the wall.

38:44.455 --> 38:46.858
Who's the dragiest of them all?

38:46.858 --> 38:48.026
- It's me.

38:48.026 --> 38:49.194
(laughter)

38:49.194 --> 38:51.496
I want to show them that I am
that bitch.

38:51.496 --> 38:54.566
- [Brooke Lynn] Next, Kendall
Gender.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.668
- I am stomping this runway

38:56.668 --> 39:00.071
like I am heading
straight to Mordor, bitch.

39:00.071 --> 39:05.009
I'm giving you sexy, sexy elf
shimmering from head to toe.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.045
- I'd put that elf on my shelf.

39:07.045 --> 39:10.281
- She's is going to steal
the kingdom and your man.

39:10.281 --> 39:12.617
She is the Lord of the cock
rings.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.588
- [Brooke Lynn] Kimora Amour.

39:16.588 --> 39:20.725
- I am the Raven. She's
dark. She's mysterious.

39:20.725 --> 39:24.329
She's sequined and feather
to the holy high heavens.

39:24.329 --> 39:25.663
- Chirp chirp, bitch.

39:25.663 --> 39:27.532
- [Brooke Lynn] Did she
just flip me the bird?

39:27.532 --> 39:29.300
- Baby, I am fluttering.

39:29.300 --> 39:33.037
I am blowing those wings.
This bitch can fly.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.073
- I can always use a good wing
woman.

39:35.073 --> 39:36.908
- [Brooke Lynn] And finally,
Pythia.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.343
- I am strutting down the runway

39:38.343 --> 39:41.679
wearing a beautiful
Victorian maidens outfit.

39:41.679 --> 39:45.550
Then bam, I am a centaur.

39:45.550 --> 39:46.417
(laughter)

39:46.417 --> 39:47.986
- [Brooke Lynn] Welcome to the
main stage

39:47.986 --> 39:49.554
of Canada's Horse Race.

39:49.554 --> 39:50.989
- I made this whole thing.

39:50.989 --> 39:53.958
It's a living, walking drag
puppet.

39:53.958 --> 39:56.995
- Oh, you can tell she
loves to be ridden bareback.

39:56.995 --> 40:01.866
So do I.

40:01.866 --> 40:04.168
- Welcome back, you fucking
bitches.

40:04.168 --> 40:05.737
(laughter)

40:05.737 --> 40:08.306
It is now time for the judges'
critiques.

40:08.306 --> 40:10.275
First up, Icesis Couture.

40:10.275 --> 40:14.612
- Yesterday, I was definitely
a little worried about you.

40:14.612 --> 40:15.480
- Okay.

40:15.480 --> 40:19.083
- And tonight, big fucking plot
twist.

40:19.083 --> 40:22.754
You really came through and
you made the crowd laugh.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.289
- You might not know my name,

40:24.289 --> 40:27.892
but I fucking know yours
because that was incredible.

40:27.892 --> 40:30.862
You took every note we
said, you applied them,

40:30.862 --> 40:31.829
and then you slayed.

40:31.829 --> 40:33.898
And the confidence was
just pouring out of you.

40:33.898 --> 40:35.300
The only issue was time.

40:35.300 --> 40:36.234
- I know.

40:36.234 --> 40:37.402
- [Emma] You gotta stick to the
time.

40:37.402 --> 40:38.503
- You went on too long,

40:38.503 --> 40:40.905
and unfortunately rules
are there for a reason.

40:40.905 --> 40:43.141
And you didn't get to me in
time.

40:43.141 --> 40:43.975
- Yeah.

40:43.975 --> 40:46.778
- And it was about me. It was
about me.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.079
But just to see you open up

40:48.079 --> 40:50.214
and see you have this
personality is amazing.

40:50.214 --> 40:53.084
- You were comfortable and
confident.

40:53.084 --> 40:57.288
And you finally were the person
that we knew was in there.

40:58.156 --> 40:59.457
- [Brooke Lynn] Kimora Amour.

40:59.457 --> 41:00.658
- Hello.

41:00.658 --> 41:02.193
- So I'm going to start with
your look.

41:02.193 --> 41:04.896
In the roast, was the most
beautiful I've ever seen you.

41:04.896 --> 41:05.730
- Thank you.

41:05.730 --> 41:08.266
- And your look on the runway
tonight, I love aspects of it.

41:08.266 --> 41:09.967
I think the wings are beautiful

41:09.967 --> 41:13.271
and I know you love a feather,
but it does not fit well.

41:13.271 --> 41:16.674
And I think that's number one
thing for a nude illusion.

41:16.674 --> 41:18.943
Also, I know you're going
for a fantasy thing,

41:18.943 --> 41:20.645
but I can't even really see your
eyes

41:20.645 --> 41:22.480
cause your eyelashes are so
heavy.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.749
- In terms of the roast,
yesterday,

41:24.749 --> 41:27.685
I thought you were so
clearly the front runner.

41:27.685 --> 41:29.087
I thought the jokes were great.

41:29.087 --> 41:31.622
I thought the energy was
great. And then today,

41:31.622 --> 41:34.325
(stutters)

41:34.325 --> 41:35.159
Where are you?

41:35.159 --> 41:37.995
- [Brooke Lynn] You came
out and you were so serious.

41:37.995 --> 41:39.997
- There were a couple of
really funny ones in there,

41:39.997 --> 41:42.333
but it was just low energy for
me.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.602
- That was my attempt
at trying to do levels

41:44.602 --> 41:46.237
cause everyone knows me.

41:46.237 --> 41:49.340
I'm at a hundred all the time.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.608
- But you didn't do levels.

41:50.608 --> 41:53.478
You did a different level and
then you just stayed there.

41:54.545 --> 41:55.747
- [Amanda] Gia Metric.

41:55.747 --> 41:56.614
- Hi, Amanda.

41:56.614 --> 41:58.316
- I love this look.

41:58.316 --> 41:59.150
- Thank you.

41:59.150 --> 42:00.151
- It's swamp thing,

42:00.151 --> 42:04.489
but very chic and I felt your
runway was very confident.

42:04.489 --> 42:07.225
- I'm really enjoying the
fantasy tonight,

42:07.225 --> 42:10.361
but your roast didn't really
work.

42:10.361 --> 42:15.133
You spent almost two minutes
talking about yourself.

42:15.133 --> 42:17.502
- Take in this beauty, honey.

42:19.737 --> 42:21.372
- Which was kind of funny,

42:21.372 --> 42:24.208
but it was not really the roast.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.377
- A lot of the jokes seemed mean
spirited.

42:26.377 --> 42:29.046
Don't get upset. I'm
not offended. I'm fine.

42:29.046 --> 42:33.251
- This was a very challenging
week for me.

42:33.251 --> 42:37.121
I've put so much time
into growing as a person

42:37.121 --> 42:39.857
and to not be mean.

42:39.857 --> 42:41.592
- It's absolutely terrifying

42:41.592 --> 42:45.797
not knowing the lines
of crude, cruel, witty.

42:45.797 --> 42:47.732
It's the dance you have to do.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.300
Was it a little harsh at times?
For sure.

42:49.300 --> 42:52.370
But the one thing I really
loved was your commitment.

42:52.370 --> 42:53.204
- Thank you.

42:53.204 --> 42:54.972
- Adriana.

42:56.207 --> 42:57.041
- Hi.

42:57.041 --> 42:58.776
- Tell me about this runway
look.

42:58.776 --> 43:02.046
- This is a Terri Rudler
Peschka.

43:02.046 --> 43:03.781
- Wow. You look beautiful.

43:03.781 --> 43:06.117
It's stunning. It's breath
taking.

43:06.117 --> 43:09.287
- I'm a little torn
because it is a recreation

43:09.287 --> 43:10.288
and this is Drag Race.

43:10.288 --> 43:12.523
And I kind of want to see your
drag.

43:12.523 --> 43:15.126
- Your roast was hit and miss.

43:15.126 --> 43:17.228
- It was a bit awkward at the
beginning

43:17.228 --> 43:18.930
because I could tell you
were incredibly nervous

43:18.930 --> 43:20.998
and you kept referring to your
notes,

43:20.998 --> 43:24.535
but then you hit a stride and
you lifted yourself back up

43:24.535 --> 43:25.736
and powered through.

43:25.736 --> 43:28.940
- I can't believe yesterday
versus today.

43:28.940 --> 43:31.609
I think you took the
notes like a champion.

43:31.609 --> 43:32.877
My hat goes off to you.

43:32.877 --> 43:34.479
- Kendall Gender.

43:34.479 --> 43:35.313
- Hello.

43:35.313 --> 43:40.318
- I just, I don't know. I
wasn't like super into it.

43:40.952 --> 43:44.255
I was obsessed with it.

43:44.255 --> 43:47.191
Oh my goodness, girl. You showed
up.

43:47.191 --> 43:48.125
- You went first.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.794
You assigned yourself to go
first

43:49.794 --> 43:52.530
and you really just
knocked it out of the park.

43:52.530 --> 43:54.665
- You got us all into it
immediately.

43:54.665 --> 43:56.300
You grabbed us with the first
joke.

43:56.300 --> 43:59.704
To me, it felt like you've
been doing roasts for a while

43:59.704 --> 44:02.640
which is annoying because I've
been doing it for decades.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.842
- You we're so prepared.

44:04.842 --> 44:06.811
I think you're the only
person who was off book.

44:06.811 --> 44:08.045
- It was quick.

44:08.045 --> 44:09.547
And you made some really funny
jokes

44:09.547 --> 44:11.349
like about Priyanka being
the Queen of the North.

44:11.349 --> 44:13.651
That's hysterical because she's
not.

44:13.651 --> 44:14.485
- Oh.

44:14.485 --> 44:15.987
- Like that's what made it even
funnier.

44:15.987 --> 44:16.821
(laughs)

44:16.821 --> 44:17.822
- You're always beautiful.

44:17.822 --> 44:22.827
But style-wise, that look
for me, was your sweet spot.

44:23.327 --> 44:25.196
In terms of your runway tonight,

44:25.196 --> 44:28.466
I think that you
definitely fit the criteria

44:28.466 --> 44:30.034
for what we're doing.

44:30.034 --> 44:31.502
- This is very fantasy.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.538
I could see this
character in a video game.

44:33.538 --> 44:35.606
So I enjoyed that part of it.

44:35.606 --> 44:36.407
- I'll take it.

44:36.407 --> 44:37.241
- Pythia.

44:37.241 --> 44:38.276
- Hello.

44:38.276 --> 44:39.176
- You've got a little-

44:39.176 --> 44:41.078
there's a little something
behind you.

44:41.946 --> 44:42.780
Oh!

44:42.780 --> 44:43.748
- This old thing?

44:43.748 --> 44:47.318
- I've seen a lot of reveals
and I was not expecting it.

44:47.318 --> 44:50.488
I love the humor and excitement

44:50.488 --> 44:52.957
and just creativity you
bring to the runway.

44:52.957 --> 44:57.728
- I am not a Dungeons and
Dragons person,

44:57.728 --> 45:01.232
because I was always too busy
getting laid and doing drugs.

45:01.232 --> 45:02.366
(laughs)

45:02.366 --> 45:07.371
But this Bo Peep, horse ass,
Mad Hatter, whatever it is,

45:07.772 --> 45:09.407
it's just breathtaking.

45:09.407 --> 45:10.241
- Thank you.

45:10.241 --> 45:11.075
- The roast.

45:11.075 --> 45:15.346
You definitely had some good
moments, a lot of bad moments.

45:15.346 --> 45:18.215
- It felt like you were
very self-conscious

45:18.215 --> 45:19.050
the whole way through,

45:19.050 --> 45:20.985
which is not something
that I associate with you.

45:20.985 --> 45:22.520
- Honestly, I don't really get
comedy.

45:22.520 --> 45:23.354
Like I don't,

45:23.354 --> 45:24.822
I'm the person that has
to like Google jokes

45:24.822 --> 45:26.090
and stuff like that.

45:26.090 --> 45:29.093
- For you, when you
lean into your weirdness

45:29.093 --> 45:32.697
and you accept that and
appreciate it and celebrate it,

45:32.697 --> 45:33.664
it's really funny.

45:33.664 --> 45:35.266
I feel like that's
something you can take over

45:35.266 --> 45:36.500
into stand up comedy.

45:37.535 --> 45:39.370
Thank you, queens.

45:39.370 --> 45:41.172
While you untuck in the
workroom,

45:41.172 --> 45:43.441
the judges will deliberate

45:43.441 --> 45:46.077
and try to figure out who
the fuck Emma Hunter is.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.478
Do you know them?
(Emma laughs)

45:47.478 --> 45:49.981
(dance music)

45:52.683 --> 45:55.119
- Honestly, that was more
terrifying than a Snatch Game.

45:55.119 --> 45:58.456
And the judges confirmed my
worries with their critiques.

45:58.456 --> 46:00.958
- [Kendall] How do you
even sit down right now?

46:00.958 --> 46:02.927
- I just want to crawl under my
big bustle

46:02.927 --> 46:04.528
and just stay there.

46:04.528 --> 46:06.330
Obviously comedy is not my
strong suit.

46:06.330 --> 46:09.800
I did my best and we'll see what
happens.

46:09.800 --> 46:12.069
If I have to lip sync tonight,
they should be worried.

46:12.069 --> 46:13.838
I have four legs. I can trip a
bitch.

46:13.838 --> 46:15.006
(laughs)

46:15.006 --> 46:17.975
- I feel that we're in this
point of the competition

46:17.975 --> 46:21.812
that the judges are going to
ask us who should go home?

46:21.812 --> 46:24.115
Are you ready to give that out?

46:25.316 --> 46:29.253
- Say me. I'm ready to go home.

46:29.253 --> 46:30.821
- Oh.
- [Icesis] Whoa.

46:30.821 --> 46:31.989
- Girl, what?

46:31.989 --> 46:34.659
What is happening right
now? Is she serious?

46:34.659 --> 46:39.664
- I have done my best. And
I have reached my peak.

46:41.565 --> 46:45.436
All the pressure on me and
that I'm putting on myself

46:45.436 --> 46:48.506
just makes me feel that I'm not
enough.

46:48.506 --> 46:51.442
And at this point, if I'm not
enough,

46:51.442 --> 46:54.345
I have to just bow out.

46:54.345 --> 46:57.348
- I don't want you to hear
like a few negative things

46:57.348 --> 46:59.717
that they said to completely
derail you

46:59.717 --> 47:01.485
because you're amazing.

47:01.485 --> 47:06.624
How could you want to leave
so far into this competition?

47:06.624 --> 47:10.094
Like you've worked so hard
and done such an amazing job.

47:10.094 --> 47:12.129
Now is not the time to give up.

47:12.129 --> 47:14.365
The judges haven't made any
decisions yet,

47:14.365 --> 47:15.399
so I don't want you-

47:15.399 --> 47:16.233
- I know.

47:16.233 --> 47:17.068
- You cannot go in with that
mentality.

47:17.068 --> 47:20.671
- It's not a mentality. It's a
fact.

47:20.671 --> 47:24.542
I wanted this challenge so much.

47:24.542 --> 47:29.647
I wanted this win to
solidify why I deserve

47:29.647 --> 47:31.716
to be in this top five.

47:31.716 --> 47:35.553
I personally know when I'm done.

47:35.553 --> 47:37.555
I'm not going to win that crown.

47:38.756 --> 47:40.658
- I never thought that this
far in the competition,

47:40.658 --> 47:44.128
these words would be coming
out of somebody's mouth.

47:44.128 --> 47:47.998
More than being shocked,
I am feeling heartbroken.

47:47.998 --> 47:50.367
I don't want to see her go.

47:50.367 --> 47:52.169
Everyone can say, "You know
what?

47:52.169 --> 47:54.772
There are many bitches
who wanted this spot

47:54.772 --> 47:56.607
and you're walking away."

47:56.607 --> 47:58.075
- [Gia] Well, yeah, I
fucking want to be here.

47:58.075 --> 47:59.477
- [Icesis] Same. I want to be
here.

47:59.477 --> 48:01.078
- I want to be here so much.

48:01.078 --> 48:02.279
You are here.

48:02.279 --> 48:05.983
You committed to this experience
and you give it your all.

48:05.983 --> 48:09.954
- Bitch, I'm not walking
away. I just know my limits.

48:09.954 --> 48:13.724
- I understand. She's an
old, bitch. She's tired.

48:13.724 --> 48:16.894
If you don't want to be
here, then start packing.

48:16.894 --> 48:18.395
What else is there to say?

48:22.099 --> 48:26.470
- Okay. Just between us funny
girls, what did you think?

48:26.470 --> 48:28.305
Starting with Gia Metric.

48:28.305 --> 48:29.807
- I loved her runway look.

48:29.807 --> 48:32.643
It was a very interesting
take on the theme.

48:32.643 --> 48:36.213
For me, her roast was all over
the place.

48:36.213 --> 48:38.215
She spent two minutes
talking about herself

48:38.215 --> 48:39.083
at the beginning.

48:39.083 --> 48:41.485
- It was like we were
watching her warm herself up,

48:41.485 --> 48:44.088
and in this stage in the
competition,

48:44.088 --> 48:45.322
there's no time for that.

48:45.322 --> 48:46.524
- A lot of times I was laughing,

48:46.524 --> 48:48.359
but I was not laughing
for the right reasons.

48:48.359 --> 48:49.193
I was laughing cause I was like,

48:49.193 --> 48:50.661
"Ha ha this is uncomfortable."

48:51.529 --> 48:53.531
Up next, Kendall Gender.

48:53.531 --> 48:55.533
- Kendall knocked it out of the
park.

48:55.533 --> 48:58.669
The jokes were rapid fire.
It was well put together.

48:58.669 --> 49:01.338
And she took us on a ride and
she opened.

49:01.338 --> 49:03.307
- It is so hard to go first.

49:03.307 --> 49:04.108
And she didn't know,

49:04.108 --> 49:06.477
but she was the warmup for
the rest of the queens.

49:06.477 --> 49:10.347
- She looked stunning in the
roast and the look tonight,

49:10.347 --> 49:12.750
even though it didn't pop for
me,

49:12.750 --> 49:16.787
she still checked all the
criteria for the runway
challenge.

49:16.787 --> 49:18.889
- The color of the draping, it
was drab,

49:18.889 --> 49:20.324
but it was better that way

49:20.324 --> 49:22.193
than if it had just been a body
suit.

49:22.193 --> 49:23.027
- Yeah.

49:23.027 --> 49:24.895
It's like putting a snake on a
turtleneck.

49:24.895 --> 49:26.931
- [Brooke Lynn] What did
we think of Kimora Amour?

49:26.931 --> 49:28.833
- The look tonight on the
runway,

49:28.833 --> 49:32.203
this nude illusion with the
completely different skin tone,

49:32.203 --> 49:35.139
and then the baggy arms
were a huge disappointment.

49:35.139 --> 49:38.242
- I love Kimora's pageant
background,

49:38.242 --> 49:41.946
but tonight the polish was
not there for me either.

49:41.946 --> 49:46.483
- And then the roast, she was
so serious and so very stern.

49:46.483 --> 49:47.484
- And that's not Kimora.

49:47.484 --> 49:49.420
That's not the Kimora we've
come to know and love.

49:49.420 --> 49:52.156
- There was just a mess
of not getting the tone

49:52.156 --> 49:53.557
of the roast quite right,

49:53.557 --> 49:55.726
and as a result of all that
kind of falling flat up.

49:55.726 --> 49:58.162
- Up next, Icesis Couture.

49:58.162 --> 49:59.730
- The runway look was gorgeous.

49:59.730 --> 50:02.499
Icesis's level of taste is
impeccable.

50:02.499 --> 50:04.501
- If I were the other queens,

50:04.501 --> 50:07.204
Icesis would be the one
stressing me the fuck out.

50:07.204 --> 50:09.740
- Her jokes were so
funny and they hit hard

50:09.740 --> 50:11.842
and she had so many of them.

50:11.842 --> 50:15.012
She was so comfortable. You
could tell she was having fun.

50:15.012 --> 50:16.447
- She came out of her shell so
much

50:16.447 --> 50:19.516
that she took up most
of everyone else's time.

50:19.516 --> 50:21.352
- This is a competition. There
are rules.

50:21.352 --> 50:22.853
You were given a certain amount
of time

50:22.853 --> 50:25.356
and she didn't even get to me
by the time her time was up.

50:25.356 --> 50:26.757
- Yeah.
- And that's a problem.

50:26.757 --> 50:28.225
Adriana.

50:28.225 --> 50:30.995
She looked beautiful at the
roast

50:30.995 --> 50:32.796
and also on the runway tonight.

50:32.796 --> 50:34.298
The runway look was spectacular.

50:34.298 --> 50:36.100
I didn't mind that it was a
replica.

50:36.100 --> 50:38.002
I thought she presented it well.

50:38.002 --> 50:41.805
The roast for me, it
started off quite weak.

50:41.805 --> 50:43.140
You could see how nervous she
was.

50:43.140 --> 50:45.242
- Some of it fell flat,
but there were some really,

50:45.242 --> 50:46.577
really funny moments in there.

50:46.577 --> 50:47.978
- The thing that I love about
Adriana

50:47.978 --> 50:49.046
is that she's a fighter.

50:49.046 --> 50:51.248
She stumbled a bit, had
to rely on her notes,

50:51.248 --> 50:54.251
but won me over because
she pushed through.

50:54.251 --> 50:55.452
- [Brooke Lynn] Okay. Pythia.

50:55.452 --> 50:59.290
- She blows me away every time
she steps out on this runway.

50:59.290 --> 51:01.125
- I see her looks week after
week

51:01.125 --> 51:02.826
and it's never something I've
seen before.

51:02.826 --> 51:06.830
- I definitely see such
a star quality in her.

51:06.830 --> 51:09.400
I just want her to start
seeing it herself as well.

51:09.400 --> 51:10.601
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

51:10.601 --> 51:11.602
- In the roast,

51:11.602 --> 51:13.904
you could really see her
second guessing herself.

51:13.904 --> 51:16.507
- The jokes were there.
The delivery was not.

51:16.507 --> 51:17.708
And so the set fell flat.

51:17.708 --> 51:19.109
But the ass.

51:19.109 --> 51:20.010
- Was not flat.

51:20.010 --> 51:21.445
- No.

51:21.445 --> 51:23.614
- All right. I think
we've made a decision.

51:24.448 --> 51:27.217
Bring back our loons.

51:27.217 --> 51:30.154
(bird call noises)

51:32.256 --> 51:36.226
Welcome back, queens. We
have made some decisions.

51:38.295 --> 51:41.198
Pythia, in the roast,

51:41.198 --> 51:43.400
you didn't have a leg to stand
on.

51:43.400 --> 51:48.005
But on the runway, you got back
in the saddle. You are safe.

51:48.005 --> 51:49.173
- Thank you.

51:49.173 --> 51:51.175
- You may move to the back of
the stage.

51:52.509 --> 51:57.514
Kimora Amour, your personality
is a breath of fresh air,

51:58.515 --> 52:01.251
but in the roast, you hit some
turbulence.

52:03.554 --> 52:06.690
I'm sorry, my dear. But
you are up for elimination,

52:09.193 --> 52:12.229
Kendall Gender, at the roast
today,

52:12.229 --> 52:14.631
you were the queen of comedy.

52:16.367 --> 52:17.701
Con-drag-ulations,

52:18.602 --> 52:20.571
you are the winner of this
week's maxi challenge.

52:20.571 --> 52:21.405
(dance music)

52:21.405 --> 52:22.406
- I won! Ah!

52:25.376 --> 52:30.381
My first mini and maxi
challenge.
Bitch, this was my week.

52:30.781 --> 52:33.984
- You have won a $2.500 gift
certificate

52:33.984 --> 52:38.989
and $5.000 cash courtesy of
Vitaly.

52:41.091 --> 52:43.260
- [Gia] Yes, bitch.
(applause)

52:43.260 --> 52:45.262
- Oh my God. Wow. Thank you so
much.

52:45.262 --> 52:47.264
- You may move to the back of
the stage.

52:51.935 --> 52:55.039
Icesis Couture, you are safe.

52:55.039 --> 52:56.907
- Thank you so much.

52:56.907 --> 52:58.709
- And great job this week.

52:58.709 --> 53:00.811
- Yes.
- Yes.

53:00.811 --> 53:05.449
- Gia Metric, your runway gave
us life.

53:05.449 --> 53:06.383
- Thank you.

53:06.383 --> 53:08.652
- But in the roast, you flat
lined.

53:10.921 --> 53:13.524
I'm sorry, my dear. But you
were up for elimination.

53:15.826 --> 53:17.961
- Adriana, that means you are
safe.

53:19.630 --> 53:20.464
- Thank you so much.

53:20.464 --> 53:21.698
- You may join the others.

53:23.567 --> 53:26.236
Two Queens stand before us.

53:27.137 --> 53:29.573
Prior to tonight, you
were asked to prepare

53:29.573 --> 53:34.478
a lip-sync performance
of "Get Down" by b4-4.

53:34.478 --> 53:37.748
This is your last chance
to impress the judges

53:37.748 --> 53:40.918
and save yourself from
elimination.

53:43.287 --> 53:48.258
The time has come for you
to lip sync for your life.

53:53.063 --> 53:55.766
- At this point in the
competition,

53:55.766 --> 53:58.335
I feel present and grounded.

53:58.335 --> 54:00.871
- Mentally, I've left the
building,

54:00.871 --> 54:04.775
but at the same time, I'm
going to put on a show.

54:04.775 --> 54:08.679
- Good luck and don't fuck it
up.

- Before we announce our
decision,

56:34.258 --> 56:39.129
I have to ask what was happening
there?

56:40.564 --> 56:44.201
- I did whatever came to my
head.

56:44.201 --> 56:45.869
I wasn't present at all.

56:47.638 --> 56:48.472
Jesus.

56:49.439 --> 56:52.175
- We just wanted you to know
that it was weird as shit.

56:53.210 --> 56:56.480
- Queens, we've made our
decision.

56:56.480 --> 57:00.017
Gia Metric, shantay, you stay.

57:02.052 --> 57:04.054
You may join the other girls.

57:04.054 --> 57:05.088
- Thank you, judges.

57:07.758 --> 57:09.626
- Kimora Amour,

57:09.626 --> 57:12.863
you came here already a seasoned
queen,

57:12.863 --> 57:16.266
but today you fly away a star.

57:16.266 --> 57:21.271
- I am so appreciative for every
day

57:21.705 --> 57:26.543
I have spent with every single
one of you.

57:26.543 --> 57:29.546
Thank you so much.

57:29.546 --> 57:32.616
- Now, sashay away.

57:32.616 --> 57:34.251
(applause)

57:34.251 --> 57:35.085
- We love you.

57:36.486 --> 57:40.123
