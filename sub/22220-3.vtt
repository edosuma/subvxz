WEBVTT

00:10.178 --> 00:15.764
(humming tune)

00:29.822 --> 00:31.403
Ah, perfection.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.568
No, no, no, absolutely not.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.111
Just get out of my face.

00:35.244 --> 00:36.984
Don't be a coward. You say you
want to clean your teeth.

00:37.121 --> 00:39.282
Brush them. Iwant to
brush my teeth.

00:39.415 --> 00:42.498
But to manually clean your
teeth as you describe is
highly inefficient.

00:42.627 --> 00:45.539
That's too damn bad. You're
not sticking that freakin'
maggot in my...

00:51.219 --> 00:52.208
What's it doing?

00:52.345 --> 00:55.303
Cleaning all the excess bacteria
and food particles.

00:55.431 --> 00:56.295
(gagging )

00:56.432 --> 00:59.299
Never swallow the Dentic.

00:59.435 --> 01:00.675
(distant roaring )

01:00.811 --> 01:03.302
(yelling)

01:04.482 --> 01:05.767
Pilot, report.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.765
This is Aeryn.
I'm in the Command.

01:07.902 --> 01:10.063
You better get up here quickly.

01:11.364 --> 01:13.195
( spits )

01:13.324 --> 01:17.533
It's kind of minty.

01:17.662 --> 01:20.199
(device squeaking)

01:26.295 --> 01:27.125
What is that?

01:27.255 --> 01:30.167
Best I can tell, it's
asteroid debris.

01:30.299 --> 01:31.835
Stay with it, Pilot.

01:31.968 --> 01:33.583
Doing my very best.

01:37.181 --> 01:39.672
Asteroid debris does not move
like that.

01:45.982 --> 01:48.940
Don't tell me Moya's
got hiccups.

01:49.068 --> 01:51.150
You're too close.
Maneuver away from it.

01:51.279 --> 01:54.271
Aeryn:
The debris cloud isn't
our problem.

01:59.495 --> 02:03.238
Hey, that's another ship.

02:03.374 --> 02:04.489
Aeryn:
It doesn't know we're here.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.490
The debris is blocking
their scan.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.663
Pilot, stay behind the debris.

02:08.796 --> 02:12.129
It's scanning?
That ship is scanning?

02:12.258 --> 02:14.169
Wait, does that mean it's...?

02:14.302 --> 02:15.417
Peacekeepehn

02:15.553 --> 02:18.260
It's a scout ship.
Crais's eyes and ears.

02:18.389 --> 02:20.129
And claws.

02:20.266 --> 02:21.346
It's a Marauder.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.638
Five-man crew.
Highest level of training.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.761
Success measured by body count.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.728
Marauder changing course.

02:31.277 --> 02:32.562
How fast can they...?

02:32.695 --> 02:34.060
How fast can they go?

02:34.196 --> 02:35.356
Hetch seven.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.070
Hetch seven?
That thing's a Hyundai.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.326
Why don't we stop playing
hide-and-seek and
just smoke 'em?

02:39.452 --> 02:43.115
If they discover us, Crais
will know exactly where to
concentrate his search.

02:43.247 --> 02:46.080
We cannot outrun a
Command Carrier.

02:46.208 --> 02:47.459
D'argo's right.

02:47.585 --> 02:50.372
Of course he is, Ms. Sun.
He's been here longer.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.120
Stay with it, Pilot.

02:53.257 --> 02:54.713
Steady...

02:54.842 --> 02:56.582
We're no longer being scanned.

02:56.719 --> 02:58.505
They're passing us by.

03:10.066 --> 03:13.308
Thank you for your help,
Officer Sun.

03:14.278 --> 03:16.269
We work together well, Pilot.

03:24.830 --> 03:28.118
( squeaking )

03:35.174 --> 03:37.005
Huh...

03:37.134 --> 03:39.216
You don't see that every day.

03:48.604 --> 03:50.811
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

03:50.940 --> 03:54.057
...A radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

03:54.193 --> 03:56.104
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe

03:56.237 --> 03:58.148
on a ship-- a living ship

03:58.280 --> 04:00.271
Full of strange
alien life-forms...

04:00.408 --> 04:01.067
Help me, help me...

04:01.200 --> 04:02.531
Listen, please.

04:02.660 --> 04:04.821
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

04:04.954 --> 04:08.913
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

04:09.041 --> 04:11.202
...doing everything I can...

04:11.335 --> 04:14.202
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:42.241 --> 04:43.356
Go on, get out of here.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.198
Shoo,go.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.192
Go home.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.820
So, those Marauders really
shook you up.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.367
The ship is called a Marauder.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.661
The team on board are commandos.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.250
Like you?

04:57.882 --> 04:59.088
What, you're worried
they'll come back?

04:59.216 --> 05:00.467
Unlikely.

05:00.593 --> 05:03.505
But not impossible?

05:03.637 --> 05:07.221
Marauders follow a very
strict search pattern.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.305
It's a cross-hatch star pattern.

05:09.435 --> 05:11.300
Clean, efficient.

05:11.437 --> 05:13.177
No prey escapes.

05:13.314 --> 05:14.850
Moya got lucky.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.722
Simple as that.

05:18.235 --> 05:21.147
You ever serve on one?

05:21.280 --> 05:23.066
My application for transfer
was awaiting

05:23.199 --> 05:25.815
Crais's approval when I got
caught up in this...

05:25.951 --> 05:28.158
this little mutiny.

05:28.287 --> 05:32.496
I'm sure your world has no force
so ruthless, so disciplined.

05:32.625 --> 05:34.456
We call them linebackers...

05:34.585 --> 05:35.950
or serial killers.

05:36.086 --> 05:40.375
Depends on whether they're
professional or amateur.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.171
Look, you're not in this alone.

05:45.304 --> 05:47.386
Everybody on board has had
their lives derailed

05:47.515 --> 05:50.507
from what they thought they were
going to be... should be.

05:50.643 --> 05:51.803
We're stuck together.

05:51.936 --> 05:54.177
As long as we are,
we might as well be...

05:54.313 --> 05:55.678
What?

05:55.814 --> 05:57.520
Family?

05:57.650 --> 05:59.436
Fnends?

06:00.194 --> 06:02.150
I want neither.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.531
Somebody's got to be there
when you need it.

06:06.367 --> 06:09.029
No offense, human,

06:09.161 --> 06:12.153
but what can I possibly
need from you?

06:12.289 --> 06:14.280
I don't know...

06:14.416 --> 06:16.953
Manners, personality...

06:17.086 --> 06:18.997
stock tips.

06:22.925 --> 06:25.086
Oh, darn it.

06:25.219 --> 06:28.677
Some fopooter is going to
pay for this.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.426
Let me help you.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.138
Is that how you see yourself?

06:36.272 --> 06:39.105
Mother always said I was
the best looking.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.315
That's why she had my older
brothers banished.

06:41.443 --> 06:45.152
She said my face belonged
on the imperial seal.

06:45.281 --> 06:47.897
But now, of course, it's ruined.

06:48.033 --> 06:51.446
It's more accurate
than you think.

07:09.638 --> 07:10.718
What do you think you're doing?

07:10.848 --> 07:12.304
Hey, do you mind?

07:29.325 --> 07:30.940
Oh.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.234
Is that how you see me?

07:34.371 --> 07:36.202
It's called a spirit painting.

07:36.332 --> 07:38.823
We delvians do it
for recreation.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.290
It's rather rushed.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.250
It looks like Rygel the Great...

07:42.379 --> 07:45.291
Rygel the first, my most
honored ancestor.

07:45.424 --> 07:49.337
Obviously a part of his spirit
resides within you.

07:50.346 --> 07:51.301
( sniffing )

07:51.430 --> 07:55.218
You had it so very easy.

08:07.488 --> 08:10.696
Crichton:
Hey, I'm missing one of
those little...

08:10.824 --> 08:12.906
pointy things with the
laser probes.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.275
Aren't you hot?

08:15.412 --> 08:16.447
No.

08:19.249 --> 08:23.117
D'Argo:
Aeryn, Crichton, l'm showing
abnormal thermal fluctuations throughout the ship.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.244
Can you confirm maintenance
bay reading?

08:25.381 --> 08:26.871
I told you it was hot.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.668
By the door.

08:33.222 --> 08:38.558
D'argo, the giant ouija
board says, uh...

08:38.686 --> 08:40.142
optimum plus three.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.306
Feels like plus 30.

08:42.439 --> 08:43.599
How long to fix it, D'argo?

08:43.732 --> 08:46.314
Not long, once we isolate
the cause.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.559
Well, then stop talking
and start isolating.

08:52.825 --> 08:53.439
Ow!

08:53.575 --> 08:55.156
Ow.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.321
You okay?

08:58.706 --> 08:59.536
Yeah.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.201
Metal splinter.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.325
We're done here.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.758
Why is it still so hot?

09:21.895 --> 09:25.808
Moya's propulsion system is
generating more heat than
usual at this speed.

09:25.941 --> 09:28.307
Diagnostics are showing some
sort of blockage in the vents

09:28.444 --> 09:30.275
preventing its discharge
into space.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.144
What about the
congelation coils?

09:32.281 --> 09:35.899
All attempts to chill the ship
are being overwritten by
the heat buildup.

09:36.034 --> 09:39.162
"Chill" being the operative
word here, Aeryn.

09:39.288 --> 09:41.279
It's a little warmer.
What's the big deal?

09:41.415 --> 09:43.406
Even shutting down every
non-vital system

09:43.542 --> 09:47.034
it's going to hit optimum
plus 15 in six hours.

09:47.171 --> 09:48.536
Worse than morons.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.708
Find the blockage, clear it.

09:50.841 --> 09:53.878
Look, l'll fix the damn
problem myself.

09:54.011 --> 09:55.251
Stop.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.127
We'll search together
tier by tier.

09:57.264 --> 10:00.848
Pilot, please assist in the
narrowing process.

10:00.976 --> 10:04.139
On Luxan, this is a mild
winter morning.

10:04.271 --> 10:08.389
Another reason Sebaceans
hate his world.

10:08.525 --> 10:11.767
This main valve controls the
heat for all of tier seven.

10:11.904 --> 10:15.362
Great. We'll just turn
this sucker off.

10:16.408 --> 10:18.023
( chuckles )

10:20.245 --> 10:22.156
Oh, yeah.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.029
No, I knew that.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.201
It's all right.

10:25.334 --> 10:27.541
There's so much new information
for you to assimilate.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.500
Sometimes the smaller things
will elude you.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.370
Yeah. Well, at least
you get that.

10:31.507 --> 10:34.123
The others treat me like I'm
some kind of Earth idiot.

10:34.259 --> 10:38.093
Granted, they're not the most
patient beings, but what
did you expect?

10:38.222 --> 10:39.177
Oh, I don't know.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.466
A little slack maybe.

10:40.599 --> 10:44.217
At least they know where they
are. How things work.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.810
It takes me ten minutes to
figure out how to open the door.

10:46.939 --> 10:50.898
You'll need to develop some
patience yourself if you
expect to survive here.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.061
I'm trying...

10:52.194 --> 10:53.855
Hmm, I am trying.

10:53.987 --> 10:58.321
But, you know, with Aeryn
and D'argo it's like
everything's a test.

10:58.450 --> 11:02.284
It's like I'm in some never
ending frat hazing at Alien U.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.539
"Frat hazing"?

11:04.665 --> 11:09.159
Next planet, l'll rent you a
copy of 'Animal House'.

11:10.671 --> 11:11.751
John...

11:11.880 --> 11:14.622
they're soldiers.
Win their respect.

11:14.758 --> 11:16.999
Exactly how do you do that?

11:17.135 --> 11:19.217
I mean, short of cutting
someone's throat.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.758
Actions. Actions speak to them.

11:21.890 --> 11:25.303
Actions like tactical maneuvers,
defending the ship

11:25.435 --> 11:27.346
fixing the heat.

11:28.981 --> 11:30.642
All right.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.937
Hey... thanks.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.650
There's a lot more of
these to check.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.019
Are you sure you've got
the hang of it now?

11:37.155 --> 11:39.771
Oh, yeah. Just watch me
spring into action.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.695
Look, I'll, check the vents
in the living quarters

11:42.828 --> 11:45.035
and meet you back on Command.

11:50.294 --> 11:52.410
Crichton:
Tier five, passageway
clear, Pilot.

11:52.546 --> 11:55.879
Ditto Zhaan and Rygel's
quarters. Checking mine now.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.757
( screeching )

12:10.063 --> 12:13.521
Uh... anybody, uh...
anybody hear me?

12:14.693 --> 12:16.183
Anybody?

12:16.320 --> 12:17.810
D'Argo here.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.107
Yeah, I, uh...

12:20.240 --> 12:21.855
I think I found our problem.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.823
What is it, Crichton?

12:23.952 --> 12:25.362
What is it?

12:25.996 --> 12:27.657
Crichton?!

12:27.789 --> 12:29.290
Bugs.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.873
Aeryn:
Stop wasting time. Ship's
beetles don't clog exhaust vents.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.493
Well, they might if they're
two feet long.

12:34.630 --> 12:37.588
Somebody tell me what these
things are.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.297
D'Argo:
You need to capture one.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.257
Yeah, capture one, right.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.546
Aeryn:
We're on our way.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.294
Whatever you do, don't let
them back in the vents.

12:44.431 --> 12:47.719
Between you and me, you guys
can go anywhere you want.

12:53.857 --> 12:54.937
Hal

12:56.360 --> 12:57.691
Oh hell, What'd | just do?

13:00.447 --> 13:01.903
( buzzing )

13:11.541 --> 13:12.826
Oh yeah! I got ya!

13:12.960 --> 13:16.077
(squealing)

13:19.758 --> 13:22.090
(squealing stops)

13:29.685 --> 13:31.767
(squealing)

14:03.218 --> 14:07.086
(chanting in native language)

14:07.222 --> 14:09.133
You're praying for
this parasite?

14:09.266 --> 14:11.222
We don't know it's a parasite.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.216
It's on board this ship
uninvited.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.639
My concern, too, Rygel.

14:15.772 --> 14:20.436
But if I can analyze its DNA,
perhaps we can understand
why it's here.

14:20.569 --> 14:22.935
Well the others think there may
be dozens of these things

14:23.071 --> 14:25.312
even hundreds throughout
our living quarters.

14:25.449 --> 14:27.235
I believe Crichton's
supposition is correct.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.779
He said that they must have come
aboard when the flock

14:29.911 --> 14:33.199
or swarm thing passed over us.

14:36.793 --> 14:37.873
Crichton...

14:38.003 --> 14:39.834
it's Crichton's DNA.

14:39.963 --> 14:40.998
My DNA?

14:41.131 --> 14:43.463
How can that bug be
carrying my DNA?

14:43.592 --> 14:45.457
Zhaan:
Well, that's what the
analyzer's saying.

14:45.594 --> 14:46.709
Well, analyze it again.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.176
I intend to.

14:48.305 --> 14:50.261
But another specimen would
be helpful, John.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.505
Alive this time, if possible.

14:51.641 --> 14:52.721
Aw, yeah, no problem.

14:52.851 --> 14:55.263
Hell, the damn things
are related to me.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.010
What's behind there?

14:57.147 --> 14:59.263
Hey, what's back there?

15:01.568 --> 15:02.774
Ion backwash chamber.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.518
Should be a giant empty room.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.736
The beetles have completely
isolated it.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.856
All four entries are sealed.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.653
Pilot, we need that
alternate entrance.

15:10.786 --> 15:12.572
Pilot:
I am still attempting access.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.695
Nothing can resist a
Prism Laser Saw.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.994
Well, you better check the
warranty, cuz, 'cause that
stuff ain't budging.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.538
Zhaan says we've got to
capture another bug

15:20.670 --> 15:22.171
alive this time.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.879
Says she wants to check
some unreliable data.

15:25.008 --> 15:28.626
Data's not the only unreliable
thing around here.

15:30.514 --> 15:31.970
What's her problem?

15:32.099 --> 15:33.384
D'Argo:
Sebacean heat delirium.

15:33.517 --> 15:35.348
Crichton:
What?

15:35.477 --> 15:38.219
Sebaceans lack the gland
necessary to regulate extreme
thermal increases.

15:38.355 --> 15:43.099
Crais and those other bastards
chasing us are cold-blooded?
Literally?

15:43.235 --> 15:45.601
It's a weakness not enough
of them die from.

15:45.737 --> 15:48.319
Pilot, I will wait no longer.

15:52.369 --> 15:55.327
How dare you cut into Moya
without warning.

15:57.415 --> 15:58.621
Hey!

15:59.501 --> 16:01.332
You had your chance.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.202
(growling)

16:09.386 --> 16:11.422
We have to get in there.

16:11.555 --> 16:12.715
Maybe you should lie down.

16:12.848 --> 16:15.885
No, I need to be left alone.

16:23.108 --> 16:25.520
Heat delirium?

16:25.652 --> 16:29.986
As our cells overheat, the
nervous system shuts down.

16:30.115 --> 16:32.231
First short-term memory,
then motor functions.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.858
The last to go is
long-term memory.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.782
Sounds like an ugly way to die.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.620
We don't die.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.080
Our body lives on in that state.

16:41.209 --> 16:42.745
It's called the living death.

16:42.878 --> 16:46.462
It's the only time we kill
our own from mercy.

16:46.590 --> 16:47.955
(metal thudding)

16:50.385 --> 16:51.886
You see anything?

16:53.013 --> 16:55.220
Another bulkhead.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.260
(bug squealing)

17:05.025 --> 17:07.641
My DNA... my DNA...

17:07.777 --> 17:09.187
Great.

17:09.321 --> 17:12.108
The giant space cockroaches
are eating out the lights.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.617
Please tell me you made a
mistake on your test.

17:14.743 --> 17:19.908
There's no way my DNA is
inside those things.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.622
Zhaan, it's making it hotter,
not cooler.

17:25.921 --> 17:27.752
Oh!

17:34.262 --> 17:36.298
What the hell?

17:42.270 --> 17:44.431
D'argo, Rygel.

17:45.982 --> 17:49.145
How do you say "we're screwed"
in your native tongue?

17:49.277 --> 17:51.268
Zhaan just beat the crap
out of me

17:51.404 --> 17:54.316
and then spit up that blue
snot the bugs use.

17:54.449 --> 17:57.031
She must have been infected
or something when she...

17:57.619 --> 17:59.234
Aeryn?

18:01.206 --> 18:02.537
Aeryn...

18:05.794 --> 18:07.125
You're not sweating.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.119
That... that's heatstroke.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.245
Pilot:
Commander Crichton,

18:10.382 --> 18:12.589
she is initiating a
thermal increase.

18:12.717 --> 18:16.084
Aeryn, you got to stop.

18:16.221 --> 18:18.428
Aeryn, you're only going to...

18:22.644 --> 18:24.509
Aeryn, no!

18:29.109 --> 18:31.065
Okay, hardball.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.319
Do not let her execute
that command.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.238
Thanks a lot, Pilot.
That's a big help.

18:42.205 --> 18:43.411
Aeryn...

18:43.873 --> 18:45.079
Stop!

18:45.667 --> 18:47.953
( screeching )

18:50.213 --> 18:52.374
Aeryn:
Crichton?

18:54.050 --> 18:58.419
What are you... doing?

19:08.898 --> 19:13.016
It was exactly like you, the way
it moved, the way it felt.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.939
I mean, it felt real, alive.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.324
It looked and acted
totally alive.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.566
It was impossible to tell the
difference.

19:20.702 --> 19:24.615
The fact that it was trying
to sabotage the ship wasn't
a clue to you?

19:24.748 --> 19:26.659
Zhaan:
He had no reason to suspect.

19:26.791 --> 19:30.955
This is a perfect duplicate of
Aeryn's exterior right down
to the micron.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.123
Did it communicate?

19:33.256 --> 19:34.871
Not a word.

19:36.384 --> 19:39.751
Neither did you when you
attacked me in the passageway.

19:39.888 --> 19:42.220
l was never in the
passageway, John.

19:43.058 --> 19:45.140
No, the other you.

19:45.977 --> 19:47.387
This bug was in my room.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.138
It must have sampled something.
Hair, whatever.

19:51.274 --> 19:54.858
It was going to use my DNA
to make a copy of me.

19:54.986 --> 19:57.193
The perfect camouflage.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.153
The perfect army.

19:59.282 --> 20:02.024
Aeryn:
If there are hundreds of these
creatures on board...

20:02.160 --> 20:04.401
Then we could be meeting our
replicants at every turn.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.449
We will kill them all on sight.

20:07.582 --> 20:09.493
And how will you tell
us from them?

20:14.923 --> 20:19.041
We will cut off the tip of our
small finger for identification.

20:20.428 --> 20:23.295
How about something a little
less permanent?

20:30.355 --> 20:32.596
I don't care about replicants.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.438
What we've got to do is...

20:35.235 --> 20:38.193
Wait. What was I going to say?

20:39.572 --> 20:41.403
I had something to say,
I know I did.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.524
We really need to lower the
ship's temperature.

20:43.660 --> 20:47.198
D'Argo:
All the climate regulators have
been sealed by the blue sludge.

20:47.330 --> 20:51.039
Can we find something or make
something that will dissolve
this blue gunk?

20:51.167 --> 20:53.419
I've certainly got enough
to analyze.

20:54.462 --> 20:57.078
I'm going to go work
with Pilot.

20:57.215 --> 20:59.080
I'm fine.

21:02.053 --> 21:05.796
Right, and all we have to do is
find where they're hiding.

21:05.932 --> 21:10.301
If you say the heat's affected
you, I won't assume you've
lost your mind.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.849
Those things are in there.

21:12.981 --> 21:14.312
(squealing)

21:14.441 --> 21:15.897
There you go.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.526
That should scatter them long
enough for you to get through.

21:17.652 --> 21:20.234
Should? I'll go when it's more
definite, thank you.

21:20.363 --> 21:21.819
You'll go now.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.609
( screaming )

21:23.741 --> 21:27.233
Luxan manners never fail
to amaze me!

21:27.370 --> 21:30.407
(chuckling)

21:32.584 --> 21:37.248
If we can't turn the temperature
down, isn't there at least
some way to...?

21:39.257 --> 21:41.623
To stop it from...?

21:44.471 --> 21:45.927
Officer Sun?

21:48.141 --> 21:51.349
I am a Peacekeeper...
a Sebacean.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.139
Look.

21:53.271 --> 21:55.307
I can't hold a weapon.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.351
I can't hold a thought.

22:02.363 --> 22:07.323
It is strange to be so close to
a Peacekeeper I do not fear.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.653
That is a compliment.

22:13.791 --> 22:16.954
The only thing I haven't
performed is a full
propulsion shutdown.

22:17.086 --> 22:20.078
It would allow me to open the
cargo doors to space.

22:20.215 --> 22:22.126
No. It's too dangerous.

22:22.258 --> 22:23.543
We leave ourselves open
for attack.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.587
We're already under attack.

22:47.534 --> 22:48.398
(gasps )

22:48.535 --> 22:50.275
I can hear something.

22:50.411 --> 22:53.278
(thumping)

22:58.670 --> 23:00.285
(shrieks)

23:00.421 --> 23:01.957
What the yozk was that?!

23:02.090 --> 23:04.297
Just trying to scare
whatever's in there.

23:04.425 --> 23:06.381
Well, it worked!

23:07.762 --> 23:09.423
We need to get the heat down.

23:09.556 --> 23:12.298
Really? What a good idea.

23:12.433 --> 23:14.264
Did you see the look
on Aeryn's face?

23:14.394 --> 23:16.225
It's like she was staring
at her own death.

23:16.354 --> 23:17.969
Or hoping for it.

23:18.106 --> 23:21.189
With Sebacean heat delirium,
death is preferable.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.228
Have you seen someone
in this death state?

23:23.361 --> 23:28.276
Yes. I've seen Peacekeepers
suffer as she does.

23:28.408 --> 23:30.069
(shrieks)

23:30.201 --> 23:32.533
They often beg for their
own death.

23:32.662 --> 23:36.075
I cannot say I did not find
the sight most enjoyable.

23:36.207 --> 23:38.368
You want her to die?

23:41.129 --> 23:43.120
That's not true.

23:43.256 --> 23:45.212
She was one of them.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.172
Now she's a comrade.

23:47.302 --> 23:48.132
Like you.

23:48.261 --> 23:51.719
Now there's a load of bull.

23:51.848 --> 23:53.258
You hate her, right?

23:53.391 --> 23:56.178
You hate Peacekeepers,
and you hate her.

23:56.311 --> 23:57.926
You want her to die.

24:00.273 --> 24:02.389
Listen, human.

24:02.525 --> 24:05.141
Everyone is frustrated.

24:05.278 --> 24:07.189
We're all hot.

24:07.322 --> 24:10.564
And we're all going to be a lot
better off if we stop just
wasting time

24:10.700 --> 24:14.067
and just fix this blasted ship.

24:17.332 --> 24:18.196
Oh!

24:18.333 --> 24:20.494
Will you stop that!

24:20.627 --> 24:22.208
Just find the problem, Rygel.

24:22.337 --> 24:24.168
And fast.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.128
The little wretch is doing
the best he can.

24:26.257 --> 24:29.169
I know, and meanwhile,
Aeryn's melting away.

24:29.302 --> 24:33.636
Look, human, for what it is
worth, the part of me that
wants Aeryn to live

24:33.765 --> 24:38.304
is greater than the part of me
that wants all Peacekeepers
to die.

24:39.937 --> 24:42.189
It's not worth much.

24:45.526 --> 24:47.687
Well, it's all I've got.

24:49.322 --> 24:52.314
A... few degrees cooler,
that's all.

24:52.450 --> 24:54.156
I'm sorry.

24:55.203 --> 24:56.693
Not your fault.

24:56.829 --> 25:01.163
I cannot reactivate the
consumables refrigeration unit.

25:01.292 --> 25:05.661
l have no place to bring your
core temperature down.

25:05.797 --> 25:09.540
Perhaps the others can think
of a way to help you.

25:10.343 --> 25:12.709
Why would the others care?

25:12.845 --> 25:16.383
My kind imprisoned them.
I'm sure they haven't forgotten.

25:21.437 --> 25:22.813
Aah...

25:22.939 --> 25:24.270
Hmm...

25:27.151 --> 25:29.142
Aah...

25:45.420 --> 25:47.285
(gasps )

26:18.828 --> 26:21.740
( com beeps )
Bad news, people. Very bad news.

26:21.873 --> 26:23.784
Crichton:
What is it, Rygel?

26:23.916 --> 26:25.247
You trying to get me killed?!

26:25.376 --> 26:28.118
Of course you are.
You sent me in here!

26:28.254 --> 26:29.209
(moans)

26:29.338 --> 26:31.249
It's hotter than squag...

26:31.382 --> 26:34.124
and they're building some
kind of nest!

26:34.260 --> 26:35.466
A nest?

26:35.595 --> 26:37.176
Too many letters for you, Luxan?

26:37.305 --> 26:39.091
Try "hive."

26:40.433 --> 26:41.639
They're making us their home.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.929
Then I'm moving.

26:46.481 --> 26:49.939
Zhaan:
John, D'argo, I've found a
substance that dissolves the sealant.

26:50.067 --> 26:52.319
Now we can take back
control of the...

26:52.445 --> 26:55.482
(gasps )

26:57.241 --> 26:58.196
Zhaan!

26:58.326 --> 26:59.441
D'argo!

26:59.577 --> 27:02.034
Where the hell is the hole,
you bastard?

27:02.163 --> 27:03.653
( screeching )
( shrieks )

27:03.790 --> 27:06.076
They're after me!

27:07.293 --> 27:08.999
Pilot, report. Where is Zhaan?

27:09.128 --> 27:12.040
Unknown, but Aeryn Sun
is down here.

27:12.173 --> 27:13.913
Almost unconscious, I'm afraid.

27:21.057 --> 27:22.422
Rygel!

27:24.977 --> 27:27.013
Are you all right?!

27:28.397 --> 27:29.898
Rygel!

27:37.240 --> 27:38.980
Rygel!

27:40.326 --> 27:42.066
D'argo, what...?

27:58.678 --> 28:00.794
Can, um...?

28:00.930 --> 28:02.886
Are you-are you able to speak?

28:03.641 --> 28:05.472
Communicate?

28:06.352 --> 28:09.310
This is freaking weird.

28:09.438 --> 28:11.144
Can you understand me?

28:20.741 --> 28:22.447
You know my moves.

28:27.582 --> 28:29.823
Yeah, and I know yours.

28:33.838 --> 28:37.171
That's why Eddie Marx kicked
your ass in the seventh grade!

28:37.300 --> 28:39.131
You fought fair...!

28:41.512 --> 28:43.753
Pilot, report. Where is Zhaan?

28:43.890 --> 28:45.630
Still no sign.

28:45.766 --> 28:49.224
My scans do reveal a growing
number of bipedal entities
moving about the ship.

28:49.353 --> 28:51.344
Who knows how many more
there are.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.391
Infinite.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.815
Minus one.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.684
How do I know that you
are Crichton?

28:58.821 --> 29:01.107
Because I'm talking and the
replicants don't do that.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.778
If they could, they wouldn't
tell you that these markings,
they're useless.

29:04.911 --> 29:07.072
They instantly adapt to
whatever they see.

29:07.204 --> 29:08.910
Where's Rygel?

29:09.040 --> 29:10.826
Where's Zhaan?

29:10.958 --> 29:14.075
There were signs of a struggle
in the lab. We cannot find her.

29:15.212 --> 29:17.248
Did we pass the obstacle test?

29:18.382 --> 29:21.465
I don't want to fail
commando training.

29:21.594 --> 29:23.300
We can do nothing else.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.135
Those invaders are isolating us.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.255
We got to find Zhaan.
We got to stick together.

29:27.391 --> 29:30.053
Rygel:
The yozk with Zhaan.
What about me?

29:30.186 --> 29:31.141
Rygel!

29:31.270 --> 29:32.305
Where are you?

29:32.438 --> 29:35.521
Back where I started from,
if you must know.

29:35.650 --> 29:38.437
If I sit perfectly still, they
don't advance.

29:38.569 --> 29:41.231
Yet, when I move...

29:41.364 --> 29:43.275
they get disagreeable.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.238
Right.

29:45.368 --> 29:46.608
Don't move.

29:46.744 --> 29:50.157
If we ever survive this, Luxan,
you must become my advisor.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.620
Fa-pu-ta!

29:51.749 --> 29:53.660
Crichton:
What's going on in there?

29:53.793 --> 29:56.705
Nothing of concern, unless you
count the fact that

29:56.837 --> 30:00.876
this thing's spitting
out replicants like a
Bellian yard rat!

30:08.265 --> 30:10.517
They've already won.
Why-why do they need more?

30:10.643 --> 30:11.758
Zhaan:
Help me.

30:11.894 --> 30:14.306
lcan't, uh...

30:14.438 --> 30:16.144
I can't get this stinger out.

30:16.273 --> 30:18.229
It's pumping some kind of
venom into me.

30:18.359 --> 30:19.223
I'll cut it out.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.316
Male voice:
No!

30:25.241 --> 30:26.606
Zhaan?

30:26.742 --> 30:28.778
I am Monarch of the Drak.

30:29.453 --> 30:30.909
Drak...?

30:31.038 --> 30:33.370
These are my aggregate.

30:37.837 --> 30:40.670
You attack me during my Genesis.

30:40.798 --> 30:42.754
And you must die.

30:42.883 --> 30:44.089
What the hell is "Genesis"?

30:44.218 --> 30:46.209
You ask the wrong warrior!

30:46.345 --> 30:47.300
Wait!

30:47.430 --> 30:48.260
This is one of them!

30:48.389 --> 30:50.846
No. It's the real Zhaan!
She's talking!

30:50.975 --> 30:53.216
The Xeroxes can't do that.

30:59.233 --> 31:01.019
What have you done to
our friend?

31:01.152 --> 31:03.063
I use her for my voice.

31:03.195 --> 31:06.153
She will die when you die,
to save Genesis.

31:06.282 --> 31:08.739
"Genesis"?

31:11.370 --> 31:13.452
The nest.

31:13.581 --> 31:15.196
The nest.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.877
This is some sort of spawning...

31:19.003 --> 31:22.086
and you're the...
you're the Queen?

31:22.214 --> 31:24.045
Life must continue.

31:24.175 --> 31:26.416
You live in space,

31:26.552 --> 31:31.592
freezing space, but you need
warmth to lay your eggs or...

31:31.724 --> 31:33.680
or to give birth.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.931
Only to give birth.

31:38.064 --> 31:41.056
So, when you're finished,
you'll go back to space.

31:41.192 --> 31:43.183
That is our cycle.

31:43.319 --> 31:44.604
Why do you threaten us?

31:44.737 --> 31:46.443
Threaten?

31:48.365 --> 31:50.572
They didn't attack until
I killed that first bug
in my room.

31:50.701 --> 31:52.032
We started this damn war.

31:52.161 --> 31:53.401
It is still a war.

31:53.537 --> 31:56.119
Either we die fighting them
or we die from the heat!

31:56.248 --> 31:58.330
We didn't know!

32:01.295 --> 32:03.160
We didn't mean to harm you.

32:05.299 --> 32:09.508
How much time do you need to
complete your cycle?

32:09.637 --> 32:10.422
"Time"?

32:10.554 --> 32:11.669
Time. Yes...

32:11.806 --> 32:14.422
you don't know time.

32:16.268 --> 32:20.602
Is your cycle nearer the
beginning or is it
nearer the end?

32:20.731 --> 32:22.312
I have birthed half my young.

32:22.441 --> 32:25.524
Half? That's good.
Good. Half is...

32:27.947 --> 32:29.687
But does it need to be this hot?

32:29.824 --> 32:32.190
Warm propels the emergence.

32:32.326 --> 32:36.194
Your habitat is capable of even
greater warmth but it resists.

32:36.330 --> 32:38.787
Tell me why it does this.

32:38.916 --> 32:41.157
Because it's a living being.

32:42.128 --> 32:44.084
A host.

32:45.422 --> 32:50.086
And this heat is very bad
for our habitat.

32:50.219 --> 32:53.552
D'Argo:
We must strike before she
decides to strike!

32:53.681 --> 32:55.421
You are enemy!

32:55.558 --> 33:00.177
If you keep it this warm
our habitat will die

33:00.312 --> 33:03.019
and there will be no heat.

33:03.983 --> 33:06.315
And all of your young will die.

33:19.456 --> 33:21.287
What the yozk kind of
deal is that?!

33:21.417 --> 33:23.282
Best we could do.

33:23.419 --> 33:25.785
Yet another reason I should
handle all negotiations.

33:25.921 --> 33:28.298
Just don't worry. It's only
a couple more hours.

33:28.424 --> 33:30.790
I can't stay here for a
few more hours.

33:30.926 --> 33:33.258
I think this thing
is salivating.

33:33.387 --> 33:35.548
And my body has functions.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.046
Stay put.

33:37.183 --> 33:39.720
As long as we don't move
until Genesis is over

33:39.852 --> 33:43.310
she'll keep the heat down and
we shouldn't see any more
replicants only baby Draks.

33:43.439 --> 33:45.646
What do they eat?

33:45.774 --> 33:47.355
I think we caught it in time.

33:47.484 --> 33:50.476
Any longer at that level, and
she would have suffered
permanent damage.

33:50.613 --> 33:52.228
Let her rest, John.

33:52.364 --> 33:55.856
She needs to recover some
strength before she's
aggravated again.

33:56.785 --> 33:57.991
How about you?

33:59.163 --> 34:01.575
I can still sense her,
deep inside.

34:02.583 --> 34:04.414
What was that like?

34:04.543 --> 34:10.288
Like we're imprisoned in this
room with the rest of the
ship just out of reach.

34:10.424 --> 34:16.841
I was within my own mind, yet I
couldn't reach past to think
or feel what I wanted.

34:18.098 --> 34:19.929
I'm glad you're safe, Zhaan.

34:20.059 --> 34:23.768
Now you've struck this truce,
we're all safe.

34:32.863 --> 34:34.273
You feeling better?

34:35.074 --> 34:36.735
No.

34:36.867 --> 34:38.107
How much longer?

34:38.244 --> 34:39.905
I don't know.

34:40.037 --> 34:46.078
We didn't cover the life cycle
of deep space insects
at JFK High.

35:05.396 --> 35:07.307
Lieutenant Melkor.

35:11.860 --> 35:15.068
Officer Sun.

35:15.197 --> 35:19.406
How fortunate for you to be
spared the punishment of a
Captain Crais court-martial.

35:19.535 --> 35:21.275
Something is wrong here, Sir.

35:21.412 --> 35:23.573
This ship is floating dead in
space with its cargo doors
wide open.

35:23.706 --> 35:27.073
Our scans show her propulsion
systems as fully operational.
Why?

35:27.209 --> 35:29.541
When we secure the ship you
will have answers.

35:29.670 --> 35:31.501
Lieutenant.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.370
Stand fast, Luxan.

35:36.844 --> 35:38.505
Our objective is the command.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.047
Advance pattern Decca.

35:40.180 --> 35:42.171
Shoot to kill is your order.

35:47.021 --> 35:48.306
She's cranked up the heat again.

35:48.439 --> 35:49.519
Why?

35:50.983 --> 35:52.598
Weapons fire on-board.

35:52.735 --> 35:53.975
Weapons fire?

35:54.111 --> 35:55.351
What?

35:55.487 --> 35:57.523
Moya's neural links have been
badly affected by the heat,

35:57.656 --> 35:59.612
but I believe it came from
the maintenance bay.

35:59.742 --> 36:05.578
I'm picking up five unidentified
life-forms and a ship in the
transport hangar.

36:05.706 --> 36:07.412
The Marauder.

36:11.211 --> 36:14.248
It must be the Monarch. She
thinks we've broken the deal.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.633
Lieutenant, another Luxan.

36:20.763 --> 36:24.255
Steady, Sergeant. This transport
was only carrying one Luxan.

36:29.438 --> 36:30.848
Enemy rear!

36:48.415 --> 36:51.031
Monarch! Speak with me.

36:51.168 --> 36:53.375
We aren't the ones
attacking you.

36:53.504 --> 36:55.244
Speak with me, dammit!

36:55.381 --> 36:56.871
It's up to you.

36:57.007 --> 36:58.292
Aeryn, no. I'm trying to...

36:58.425 --> 36:59.801
Before the living death
takes hold,

36:59.927 --> 37:03.340
you have to be prepared to
kill me. Promise.

37:03.472 --> 37:05.258
No, not a chance.

37:05.391 --> 37:07.302
You said I'm not alone.

37:07.434 --> 37:08.765
A friend would do this for me.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.680
Family would do it swiftly.

37:10.813 --> 37:13.896
(whimpering)

37:18.779 --> 37:20.770
The heat, Sir.

37:22.366 --> 37:25.654
The prisoners have done this.
It's their only defense.

37:25.786 --> 37:27.742
But what's this sealant?

37:29.331 --> 37:31.287
We must resist.

37:31.417 --> 37:33.248
We must retreat.

37:33.377 --> 37:36.164
I'll attribute that to heat
delirium, Officer.

37:36.296 --> 37:37.627
The Command is this way.

37:37.756 --> 37:38.962
Move!

37:49.893 --> 37:51.679
I can't do this. I can't.

37:51.812 --> 37:53.268
We don't have a choice.

37:53.397 --> 37:55.433
Do you know what you
are asking me?

37:55.566 --> 37:58.899
Do you realize how hideous
this thing is?

37:59.027 --> 38:00.278
You went in to negotiate.

38:00.404 --> 38:02.019
Now is your chance.

38:02.156 --> 38:05.114
Ask him what Rygel the
first would do.

38:05.242 --> 38:07.858
Rygel, Zhaan wants to know...

38:08.745 --> 38:10.076
Rygel?

38:19.381 --> 38:21.337
What's happening?

38:23.302 --> 38:28.592
I am Rygel, sixteenth of my
lineage, Dominar of the
Hynerian Empire.

38:28.724 --> 38:35.721
At once your equal and your
humble petitioner, requesting
an audience.

38:54.541 --> 38:56.202
What's happening?

38:58.545 --> 39:00.376
Rygel!

39:05.385 --> 39:07.125
Rygel, come in. Come in, Rygel.

39:07.262 --> 39:08.342
He has to be there.

39:08.472 --> 39:10.053
That is enough. He is gone.

39:10.182 --> 39:11.718
Look, it was my idea to
send him in there.

39:11.850 --> 39:15.638
And it failed. But we are
still alive.

39:15.771 --> 39:17.727
He's right.

39:18.774 --> 39:20.184
Zhaan, what do you think?

39:20.317 --> 39:23.275
( Monarch's voice moans)

39:25.197 --> 39:25.856
Monarch?

39:25.989 --> 39:27.195
SHence.

39:27.324 --> 39:28.564
You have to listen to me.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.281
Those people only look like us.

39:30.410 --> 39:32.116
-Silence!
-I will not be silent!

39:32.246 --> 39:33.531
You're killing us for no reason!

39:33.664 --> 39:36.121
I have communed with
your Sovereign.

39:36.250 --> 39:37.330
He is most agreeable.

39:37.459 --> 39:39.040
I trust him.

39:39.169 --> 39:41.706
Rygel is not my Sovereign.

39:41.838 --> 39:43.453
He is today.

39:43.590 --> 39:45.421
Then you know we wouldn't
hurt you.

39:45.551 --> 39:47.382
I know all.

39:53.433 --> 39:56.095
These creatures, whatever they
are, are no real threat to us.

39:56.228 --> 39:57.718
We continue forward.

39:57.854 --> 39:59.185
Sir!

40:00.023 --> 40:01.684
Crichton.

40:08.699 --> 40:10.530
What the...?

40:13.120 --> 40:15.111
( agonized cries )

40:15.247 --> 40:18.239
Locked in this room,
we can't help you.

40:18.375 --> 40:19.785
Let us out.

40:22.713 --> 40:24.374
We can stop them.

40:34.224 --> 40:37.182
Monarch:
I will allow the thermal
to lower.

40:37.311 --> 40:39.097
No.

40:39.229 --> 40:40.389
Wait.

40:45.444 --> 40:46.809
Do it.

40:48.363 --> 40:50.228
Don't lower the heat.
Crank it up.

40:58.582 --> 41:00.914
(groans painfully)

41:06.757 --> 41:09.544
(Zhaan's voice):
I'll look after her. Go.

41:18.644 --> 41:19.633
It's just you and me.

41:19.770 --> 41:22.557
Actually, it is just me...

41:22.689 --> 41:24.225
and you.

41:28.362 --> 41:29.522
Aeryn...

41:29.655 --> 41:31.236
I feel the living death.

41:31.365 --> 41:32.400
No.

41:32.532 --> 41:34.989
No, you hold on.

41:35.118 --> 41:36.369
I won't let it happen.

41:36.495 --> 41:38.360
It's not your choice.

41:39.414 --> 41:41.405
Remember your promise.

41:43.794 --> 41:45.750
( groans )

41:46.963 --> 41:48.339
Move!

42:14.199 --> 42:15.655
-Pilot?
-Yes.

42:15.784 --> 42:17.320
More pressure.

42:17.452 --> 42:19.443
Colder water.

42:19.579 --> 42:21.444
Living death.

42:21.998 --> 42:23.863
Crichton...

42:24.000 --> 42:25.661
Promise...

42:44.354 --> 42:45.469
Sir.

43:01.872 --> 43:02.907
Shoot them.

43:03.039 --> 43:04.074
Shoot them all.

43:04.207 --> 43:06.289
Promise...

43:06.626 --> 43:08.412
Promise.

43:09.296 --> 43:10.502
Crichton.

43:17.095 --> 43:19.928
Did you ever have one of
those days when

43:20.056 --> 43:22.889
life just ain't what you thought
it was going to be?

43:23.018 --> 43:24.508
I killed you.

43:24.644 --> 43:26.305
I'm still here.

43:31.401 --> 43:35.019
What kind of creature are you?

43:35.155 --> 43:37.316
That's a good question.

43:38.700 --> 43:42.818
It's too bad Crais didn't ask
that before he declared
war on me.

43:42.954 --> 43:44.160
Crichton. Out of the way.

43:44.289 --> 43:47.372
No. D'argo, this one's mine.

43:50.837 --> 43:54.546
We got two choices here,
Peacekeepep

43:54.674 --> 44:00.340
You can stick around and find
out how hot it's going to get

44:00.472 --> 44:05.091
or you can return to your
Captain Crais.

44:05.227 --> 44:06.433
Crichton.

44:07.354 --> 44:09.310
You would let us leave?

44:10.774 --> 44:16.770
Tell him he picked the wrong
species to screw around with.

44:16.905 --> 44:19.271
He wants to fight, fine.

44:19.407 --> 44:21.398
Look around.

44:21.535 --> 44:24.117
Take a good look around.

44:26.039 --> 44:28.200
And multiply that by thousands.

44:29.793 --> 44:31.533
Let's get you back to your ship.

44:37.592 --> 44:40.959
I believe the human Crichton
gave you a choice.

44:41.096 --> 44:42.211
Go ahead.

44:42.347 --> 44:43.883
Use your blade.

44:44.015 --> 44:46.552
The next time Crais sees my
face, his crew'll be dead

44:46.685 --> 44:49.677
and he'll be staring up from
a pool of his own blood.

45:16.590 --> 45:18.205
A brave gamble, Crichton.

45:18.341 --> 45:21.174
Nah, you wouldn't have let
him skewer me.

45:21.303 --> 45:23.294
Right?

45:23.430 --> 45:25.671
You risked Aeryn Sun's life.

45:25.807 --> 45:28.514
I would still have preferred
killing them on the spot.

45:28.643 --> 45:32.431
Well, this way there's a chance
Crais will catch a hint and
leave us alone.

45:36.276 --> 45:37.186
A small chance.

45:37.319 --> 45:39.105
( snoring )

45:39.237 --> 45:41.899
Big fella...

45:42.032 --> 45:43.442
you look refreshed.

45:43.575 --> 45:47.067
Yes, well, a three hour trinkas
bath will do that for you.

45:47.203 --> 45:51.242
I had blue crud way up in places
you don't want to know about.

45:52.375 --> 45:53.785
You did a hell of a job today.

45:53.919 --> 45:57.411
Yes, well, there's a lot of
Rygel the First in here.

45:57.547 --> 46:01.381
You know, if I had new clothes
of cray-spun shimmer weave

46:01.509 --> 46:03.761
the resemblance would
startle you.

46:03.887 --> 46:07.550
I'm pleased to report that the
temperature is now at optimum.

46:07.682 --> 46:08.842
That's good news for Aeryn.

46:08.975 --> 46:09.930
Where is she?

46:10.060 --> 46:12.722
I believe on the terrace.

46:12.854 --> 46:14.264
The Draks are leaving.

46:14.397 --> 46:16.228
Monarch wishes a final
word with us.

46:24.282 --> 46:26.443
( Monarch's voice):
We are pleased.

46:26.576 --> 46:28.908
Genesis is concluded.

46:29.037 --> 46:30.368
That pleases us, too, Monarch.

46:30.497 --> 46:33.204
We are also pleased by the
encounter between us.

46:33.333 --> 46:36.291
Well, I think I can speak for
all of us when l...

46:36.419 --> 46:38.580
We shall not meet again
Great Ruler.

46:38.713 --> 46:42.046
Don't worry. This one will
last me a lifetime.

46:45.428 --> 46:47.293
(Zhaan's voice):
Oh...

46:47.430 --> 46:49.637
They'll be gone soon.

46:51.267 --> 46:53.474
So remarkable.

47:04.364 --> 47:06.070
Easy now, just lean on me.

47:06.199 --> 47:07.439
Yes, I know I can.

47:09.327 --> 47:10.362
Home sweet home.

47:11.246 --> 47:13.578
I'll be fine from here.

47:13.707 --> 47:17.370
Oh, I must say you handled
yourself like quite a man
of action today.

47:17.502 --> 47:20.619
Yeah, I'm getting the hang
of a few things.

47:20.755 --> 47:22.336
Of course when I do...

47:22.465 --> 47:25.377
Things change and you find
you're more confused than
you were before.

47:25.510 --> 47:27.296
Yeah, pretty much.

47:27.429 --> 47:29.169
Time and patience.

47:29.305 --> 47:31.261
Time and patience.

47:31.391 --> 47:32.631
Is that your answer
for everything?

47:32.767 --> 47:35.304
Yes, because it's always
the right answer.

47:35.437 --> 47:36.552
Okay.

47:36.688 --> 47:38.724
How does time and patience
answer this?

47:38.857 --> 47:43.271
We see the Draks, or we
saw them, as pests.

47:43.403 --> 47:45.064
Something to be stepped on
and crushed.

47:45.196 --> 47:46.652
We were ignorant.

47:46.781 --> 47:48.487
Well, I definitely pulverised
one on sight.

47:48.616 --> 47:50.527
And I would have done the
same thing to the Dentic

47:50.660 --> 47:54.403
and those germ bugs that you
injected me with when I
first came on board.

47:54.539 --> 47:55.745
The translator microbes.

47:55.874 --> 47:56.954
Yeah, those guys.

47:57.083 --> 47:59.745
But, see, you see them as good.

47:59.878 --> 48:01.493
Oh, we've learned to
work with them.

48:01.629 --> 48:03.620
Isn't that the same where
you come from?

48:03.757 --> 48:05.293
I guess.

48:05.425 --> 48:09.589
I mean, some people keep pets
that others would just
as soon eat.

48:11.431 --> 48:14.844
If you're asking for a
distinction, I think it's
often unclear.

48:14.976 --> 48:19.436
Moya is alive and she's our
protector, but she's also
our servant.

48:19.564 --> 48:22.601
She relies on us, and
we rely on her.

48:22.734 --> 48:25.692
It's a mutual symbiotic
relationship.

48:25.820 --> 48:31.235
So who lives and dies in your
world is as arbitrary as
it is in mine.

48:36.247 --> 48:41.492
The answer is reverence for all
living beings, which may
come with...

48:41.628 --> 48:44.290
Time, and patience.

48:44.422 --> 48:46.128
Yes, John.

48:46.257 --> 48:49.465
I get the feeling you're going
to get the hang of things soon.

49:03.441 --> 49:05.102
Hey.

49:05.777 --> 49:07.267
Remember me?

49:07.403 --> 49:11.396
Didn't we meet at a party
a few years back?

49:12.450 --> 49:14.236
Some of what happened
I can't recall,

49:14.369 --> 49:17.782
but almost everything else
has come back.

49:17.914 --> 49:20.371
How are the shakes?

49:22.544 --> 49:24.751
I'll be fine.

49:27.715 --> 49:29.216
You know...

49:29.342 --> 49:33.585
I always thought that lesser
life-forms were useless,

49:33.721 --> 49:35.632
just something to be squashed.

49:35.765 --> 49:38.256
Yeah, it's...

49:38.393 --> 49:40.850
it's humbling when you
realize that...

49:44.440 --> 49:46.692
You're not talking about
the Draks, are you?

49:47.694 --> 49:49.355
Fine.

49:49.487 --> 49:56.359
Well, on behalf of lesser
life-forms everywhere,
I accept the compliment.

49:58.371 --> 50:00.703
Could you have kept
your promise?

50:19.392 --> 50:21.849
You know, all things considered,

50:21.978 --> 50:24.811
there are worse ways
to end a day.
