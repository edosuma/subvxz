14:53.351 --> 14:56.896
HELL...

14:56.896 --> 14:58.231
I NEED SOMEONE
I CAN TRUST.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.822
WHEN DO YOU WANT ME BACK?

15:10.201 --> 15:11.494
[Tyra laughs]

15:11.536 --> 15:13.412
THE GUY, LIKE I SAID,
PASSED OUT.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.581
HE JUST CAN'T GET AWAY
FROM MY GRIP.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.291
I'M WORKING OUT 24/7.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.252
JUST EAT RIGHT.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.920
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO LOSE WEIGHT.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.381
NO, LOOKS CAN DECEIVE YOU.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.757
BACK THEN I WAS JUST STICKS.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.384
THEY USED TO ACTUALLY CALL ME
"STICKS."

15:26.425 --> 15:27.260
[laughs]

15:27.260 --> 15:30.763
BUT IT‐‐IT WAS A FUN TIME,
YOU KNOW?

15:30.805 --> 15:31.764
I THINK‐‐
I THINK IT WOULD BE

15:31.806 --> 15:32.765
A GOOD LIFE, YOU KNOW?

15:32.807 --> 15:34.934
[knocking on door]

15:36.602 --> 15:39.939
[louder knocking]

15:47.280 --> 15:49.031
TIM!

15:49.949 --> 15:50.950
MMM.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.910
RISE AND SHINE.

15:52.952 --> 15:53.953
IT'S 3:00 PM.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.913
YEAH, IT IS.

15:55.997 --> 15:58.040
[grunts]

15:59.000 --> 16:01.127
GLAD YOU STOPPED BY,
ACTUALLY.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.129
JUST, YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT, UH...

16:03.129 --> 16:05.631
ORGANIC AND BIOLOGICAL
COMPOUNDS?

16:05.631 --> 16:06.799
I'M NOT DOING YOUR HOMEWORK,
TIM.

16:06.841 --> 16:09.844
I'M‐‐I'M HERE ABOUT SANTIAGO.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.889
ALL RIGHT.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.933
SANTIAGO, ISN'T THAT, UH...

16:15.975 --> 16:17.268
HOG CATCHER?

16:17.310 --> 16:18.936
HE'S NOT A HOG CATCHER.

16:18.978 --> 16:19.979
HE'S A STUDENT
TRYING TO LEARN FOOTBALL.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.274
NO, THANK YOU.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.109
YEAH, I HEARD, UH...

16:25.151 --> 16:27.153
I HEARD HE'S, UH, CRAP.

16:27.195 --> 16:28.487
RIGHT.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.990
OKAY, SO WHICH IS WHY

16:31.032 --> 16:33.492
I WAS WONDERING IF MAYBE
YOU COULD HELP HIM OUT.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.994
YOU KNOW, MAYBE TEACH HIM
A FEW THINGS

16:34.994 --> 16:37.205
ABOUT FOOTBALL
AND HOW TO PLAY.

16:37.205 --> 16:39.040
SEE, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE HEARD OR NOT,

16:39.081 --> 16:42.335
BUT I KIND OF GOT KICKED OFF
THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.336
SO I DON'T REALLY SEE WHY

16:43.377 --> 16:45.296
I'D HELP SOMEONE
GET ON IT.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.006
WELL, GEE,
I DON'T KNOW, TIM.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.342
WHY WOULD ANY HUMAN BEING
HELP ANOTHER?

16:49.342 --> 16:50.259
WHY‐‐

16:50.301 --> 16:53.512
WHY WOULD SOMEONE
DROP EVERYTHING AND GO

16:53.554 --> 16:55.264
ALL THE WAY TO MEXICO
JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE CALLED

16:55.306 --> 16:56.599
AND ASKED FOR HELP?

16:56.641 --> 16:57.975
UH, YEAH, SEE,

16:58.017 --> 16:58.768
THIS IS A BIT DIFFERENT

16:58.809 --> 16:59.894
BECAUSE THAT WAS LIFE
OR DEATH.

16:59.936 --> 17:02.605
THIS DOESN'T REALLY SOUND
LIKE LIFE OR DEATH TO ME.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.398
IT'S A FAVOR, TIM.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.570
UNBELIEVABLE.

17:11.530 --> 17:14.992
THANKS A LOT.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.996
[door slams]

17:19.038 --> 17:21.082
SO ERIC, WE THINK WE'VE FOUND
A SOLUTION

17:21.123 --> 17:23.709
TO THIS LITTLE SALARY SNAFU.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.044
(Brecker)
A LITTLE CREATIVE APPROACH.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.212
YEAH.

17:26.254 --> 17:27.171
HERE'S THE DEAL.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.382
I CANNOT FREE UP ANY MORE
COACHING FUNDS

17:29.382 --> 17:30.883
FOR THE TIME BEING.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.552
BUT THERE'S A SMALL POOL
OF MONEY SET ASIDE

17:32.552 --> 17:35.137
FOR AN ATHLETIC DIRECTOR,
SO‐‐

17:35.179 --> 17:37.390
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR?

17:37.390 --> 17:40.059
(Buddy)
YEAH, LIKE YOU WOULD BE
THE HEAD

17:40.059 --> 17:42.228
OF THE ENTIRE ATHLETIC
DEPARTMENT.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.564
WELL THAT'S GREAT, BUT I THINK
I'VE GOT ENOUGH RESPONSIBILITY‐‐

17:44.564 --> 17:45.982
ERIC, IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.233
THE DEPARTMENT PRETTY MUCH
RUNS ITSELF.

17:47.275 --> 17:48.234
(Buddy)
JUST THINK ABOUT THIS:

17:48.276 --> 17:49.235
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR.

17:49.277 --> 17:50.987
TITLE.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.572
I MEAN, IF YOU NEEDED IT
ON A RESUME.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.198
IF YOU'RE EVER APPLYING
FOR ANOTHER JOB

17:54.240 --> 17:55.491
IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD.

17:55.533 --> 17:56.659
(Brecker)
THE PAYCHECK'S PRETTY MUCH

17:56.701 --> 17:58.077
JUST A GRAVY TRAIN PAYCHECK.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.704
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

17:59.745 --> 18:01.455
[clears throat]

18:01.497 --> 18:03.457
HOW MUCH DOES THIS JOB PAY?

18:03.457 --> 18:06.085
WELL IT'S NOT BUDGETED
AT A FULL TIME POSITION.

18:06.127 --> 18:07.253
IT'S PART‐TIME.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.088
BUT YOU COMBINE IT

18:09.088 --> 18:09.922
WITH WHAT YOU'RE ALREADY
BRINGING HOME,

18:09.964 --> 18:11.757
YOU'RE GONNA BE
WITHIN SPITTING DISTANCE

18:11.757 --> 18:13.009
OF WHAT YOU WERE MAKING
LAST YEAR.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.176
SPITTING DISTANCE?

18:14.218 --> 18:17.054
ERIC, IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.598
I SWEAR TO YOU.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.725
TEMPORARY.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.103
(Riggins)
WHAT IS THAT?

18:24.145 --> 18:27.690
THAT'S A, UM,
THAT'S A PUMP FOR HER BREAST.

18:27.732 --> 18:30.109
WHAT?

18:30.151 --> 18:31.277
YOU SERIOUS?

18:31.319 --> 18:33.279
YEAH, IT, LIKE,
SQUEEZES...

18:33.279 --> 18:35.281
IT SQUEEZES MILK OUT
OF A LADY'S UDDERS.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.575
YOU HOOK IT UP.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.701
THERE'S SOMETHING IN THERE

18:38.743 --> 18:40.286
AND YOU JUST PUMP IT‐‐

18:40.328 --> 18:41.454
IS THERE A MOTOR
OR SOMETHING?

18:41.454 --> 18:42.663
IT'S GOT SOME KIND
OF MOTOR TO IT.

18:42.705 --> 18:43.205
(Tami)
OH, HEY.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.832
HEY, TAMI.
SORRY.

18:44.832 --> 18:48.419
IT'S REALLY NOT A TOY.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.630
UM, WELCOME BACK, TIM.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.632
GLAD YOU MADE IT HOME SAFE‐‐
SAFELY.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.092
I'M REAL SORRY ABOUT THAT,
DISAPPEARING AND ALL.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.094
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN TRYING

18:57.136 --> 18:58.137
TO GET HIM
TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE

18:58.137 --> 18:58.971
TO HIMSELF AND TO OTHERS.

18:59.013 --> 19:00.640
(Riggins)
THAT'S GOOD ADVICE, BILLY,

19:00.640 --> 19:02.600
CONSIDERING YOU'RE, UH, BANGING
MY EX‐GIRLFRIEND.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.976
SHE'S NOT YOUR EX‐GIRLFRIEND.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.478
ALL RIGHT, WELL, Y'ALL,
CAN WE FOCUS PLEASE?

19:05.519 --> 19:07.146
AND THAT KID LIKES ME
TWICE AS MUCH AS YOU,

19:07.146 --> 19:08.147
BY THE WAY‐‐

19:08.147 --> 19:09.732
(Tami)
HEY! HEY! HEY!

19:09.774 --> 19:11.150
CAN WE FOCUS?
THANK YOU.

19:11.192 --> 19:12.652
'CAUSE IT LOOKS TO ME

19:12.652 --> 19:14.070
LIKE ON YOUR LITTLE SOJOURN,
TIM,

19:14.111 --> 19:15.112
YOU MISSED YOURSELF

19:15.154 --> 19:16.489
OH, TWO BIOLOGY EXAMS.

19:16.530 --> 19:17.823
YEAH.

19:17.823 --> 19:18.658
AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE
A PRETTY IMPORTANT

19:18.699 --> 19:21.118
TERM PAPER
IN YOUR ENGLISH LIT CLASS.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.495
SO LET'S START THERE.

19:22.495 --> 19:26.290
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT A SOJOURN IS, MA'AM.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.168
A SOJOURN IS WHAT'S
GONNA KEEP YOU BACK A YEAR

19:29.168 --> 19:30.336
IF YOU DON'T GET IT TOGETHER.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.254
THAT'S RIGHT.
CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE.

19:32.296 --> 19:33.255
THAT'S WHAT A SOJOURN IS.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.674
THE REST OF IT
YOU CAN LOOK UP.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.176
(Billy)
TAMI, I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.302
I AM GONNA BE SQUEEZING
HIS TESTICLES

19:38.344 --> 19:40.096
UNTIL HE IS BLEEDING
TERM PAPERS.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.473
BUT THAT ASIDE,
I MEAN,

19:42.515 --> 19:44.433
I JUST NEED TO GET HIM
BACK ON THE TEAM.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.185
I MEAN, HIS FUTURE'S
RIDING ON THIS.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.436
SO I WAS THINKING, LIKE,
MAYBE YOU COULD, YOU KNOW...

19:47.478 --> 19:49.438
[makes clicking sound]

19:49.480 --> 19:51.190
EXERT A LITTLE INFLUENCE
ON COACH.

19:51.232 --> 19:53.109
IS THAT RIGHT?
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE THINKING?

19:53.150 --> 19:54.777
WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU WANT HER TO DO?

19:54.819 --> 19:56.195
YOU KNOW, MAYBE...

19:56.237 --> 19:57.029
HEY, HEY, HEY.

19:57.071 --> 20:00.449
I'M HERE
AS HIS EDUCATIONAL ADVISOR.

20:00.491 --> 20:01.784
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S WHAT
I'M HERE FOR.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.536
THAT'S WHAT MY ROLE IS.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.704
YOU WANT TO TALK
TO COACH TAYLOR?

20:04.704 --> 20:05.496
YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.164
YOU CAN GO TALK TO HIM
YOURSELF.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.250
YES, MA'AM.
COME ON, JACKASS.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.293
WELL, NOW WAIT A MINUTE.
I'M NOT FINISHED.

20:11.335 --> 20:14.797
LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON.
HUH, CHAD?

20:14.839 --> 20:16.716
YOUR BOY PLAYED WELL
ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.884
YEAH, I DON'T WANT HIM
GETTING A FAT HEAD THOUGH.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.469
HE'S STILL GOT A WAYS
TO GO.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.346
CHAD, RONNIE BLAIR.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.347
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.640
PLEASURE.

20:24.682 --> 20:25.433
THEY BROUGHT ME
IN FROM MIDLAND

20:25.474 --> 20:26.726
TO HELP OUT
WITH YOUR HOMICIDE.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.227
YEAH, THAT RIGHT?

20:28.269 --> 20:29.311
HOW'S THE CASE GOING?

20:29.353 --> 20:31.689
(Tambor)
ALL BUT DEAD
TILL WE CAME ACROSS THESE.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.066
THE CORONER FOUND
SOME CAR SEAT FIBERS

20:34.108 --> 20:36.235
IN THE DEAD GUY'S JACKET ZIPPER.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.236
(Tambor)
WE'RE THINKING THEY CAME
FROM THE VEHICLE

20:37.236 --> 20:38.362
THAT TOOK HIM TO THE RIVER.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.197
KILLER PROBABLY PULLED
THE BODY OUT

20:40.239 --> 20:41.073
AND DIDN'T REALIZE
HE WAS TAKING

20:41.073 --> 20:42.825
SOME OF HIS OWN CAR UPHOLSTERY
WITH IT.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.827
YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF CAR?

20:44.869 --> 20:47.204
(Blair)
WELL IT MATCHES
THREE DIFFERENT MODELS OF GM

20:47.246 --> 20:49.457
MANUFACTURED BETWEEN '74
AND '78.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.876
(Tabor)
DMV'S PROBABLY GONNA PULL UP
ABOUT 20 OF THESE

20:51.917 --> 20:52.835
IN DILLON ALONE.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.838
ALL RIGHT, WELL GOOD LUCK
WITH YOUR DIGGING.

20:55.880 --> 20:56.839
THANKS.

KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.177

THANKS FOR HELPING US OUT.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.137
HEY, NO PROBLEM.

21:15.566 --> 21:18.277
(Street)
SET! HIT!

21:18.277 --> 21:21.447
SHRADER,
YOU STAND UP LIKE THAT,

21:21.447 --> 21:22.323
YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR RUNNING BACK KILLED.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.199
IF YOU STAND UP LIKE THAT
ON A BLITZ,

21:23.240 --> 21:24.617
YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR QUARTERBACK KILLED.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.118
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

21:26.160 --> 21:26.952
LEFT EYE
UNDERNEATH HIS LEFT EAR HOLE.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.997
GET LOW AND DRIVE.
WHAT DO YOU DO?

21:29.997 --> 21:31.916

21:55.314 --> 21:56.774

FOOL?

22:00.778 --> 22:01.737
I AM, BUT YOU'RE
NOT FOLLOWING ME!

22:01.779 --> 22:03.614
HEY, COACH, WHAT THE HELL!
HEY, SETTLE DOWN.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.324
WHAT'S WRONG, SMASH?

22:05.324 --> 22:06.826
YOU HEAR ME?
YOU HEAR ALL RIGHT?

22:06.867 --> 22:08.160
(Smash)
YEAH, I'M HEARING ALL RIGHT.

22:08.202 --> 22:10.329
(Coach Taylor)
GET IT BACK.

22:10.371 --> 22:11.831
YES, I'VE GOT
THE INVOICE HERE.

22:11.872 --> 22:12.873
WHAT I DON'T HAVE
IS THE EQUIPMENT.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.208
I'M NOT.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.334
I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU

22:15.334 --> 22:16.335
I'M NOT GONNA SEND YOU
A CHECK

22:16.335 --> 22:17.670
UNTIL I GET THE EQUIPMENT.

22:17.711 --> 22:20.339
WHY WOULD I‐‐

22:20.339 --> 22:22.174
ALL RIGHT.

22:22.216 --> 22:23.467
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL GET
THE CHECK THEN.

22:23.509 --> 22:24.969
YEAH, YOU TOO.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.679
WHAT?

22:26.720 --> 22:27.680
ALL RIGHT, COACH, LOOK,

22:27.721 --> 22:28.806
I DON'T MEAN NO DISRESPECT,

22:28.848 --> 22:29.807
BUT I GOT MY ASS HANDED TO ME

22:29.849 --> 22:30.933
OUT THERE ON THE FIELD TODAY.

22:30.975 --> 22:33.352
AND LOOK, I KNOW RIGGINS
SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE TO MEXICO.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.813
AND HE'S DISRESPECTFUL
TO YOU AND THE COACHING STAFF.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.190
HE DRINKS TOO MUCH AND MISSES
TOO MANY PRACTICES.

22:38.232 --> 22:40.359
BUT I NEED HIM.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.318
I NEED HIM, COACH.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.236
I'M GONNA GET KILLED OUT THERE
WITHOUT HIM.

22:42.278 --> 22:42.820
IS IS REALLY WORTH
THROWING AWAY THE SEASON

22:42.862 --> 22:44.446
JUST TO PROVE A POINT?

22:44.488 --> 22:45.531
STOP RIGHT THERE!

22:45.531 --> 22:46.699
I'M NOT THROWING AWAY
MY SEASON.

22:46.699 --> 22:47.825
ARE YOU THROWING AWAY
YOUR SEASON?

22:47.867 --> 22:49.034
I'M NOT THROWING AWAY
MY SEASON.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.327
SEEMS TO ME LIKE TIM RIGGINS
IS THE ONE

22:50.369 --> 22:51.203
THROWING HIS SEASON AWAY.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.705
AS FAR AS YOUR BLOCKING
IS CONCERNED,

22:52.705 --> 22:54.331
IT WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.917
NOW GO TO CLASS.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.544
GO TO CLASS!

23:10.055 --> 23:12.892
[knocking on door]

23:12.892 --> 23:13.934
YEAH?

23:17.563 --> 23:19.982
AND WHAT DO I OWE
THE PRESENCE

23:20.024 --> 23:22.735
OF THE CAPTAIN
OF THE DILLON PANTHERS?

23:22.776 --> 23:24.820
IT'S A NICE CRIB, RIG.

23:24.862 --> 23:28.407
WHAT'S UP?
THE MAID'S ON VACATION?

23:28.449 --> 23:29.450

I NEED TO TALK TO YOU

23:38.417 --> 23:39.710

OH, I'M SCREWING UP THE TEAM

23:40.920 --> 23:41.879

23:43.088 --> 23:45.049

23:46.759 --> 23:49.011

HEY, JULIE.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.740
WHAT, UH‐‐

24:09.782 --> 24:12.284
WHAT CAN I‐‐
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

24:12.326 --> 24:15.579
UM...

24:15.621 --> 24:17.498
I DON'T‐‐
I DON'T REALLY WANT ANYTHING.

24:17.498 --> 24:18.791
I JUST‐‐

24:18.832 --> 24:23.629
I JUST‐‐I WANTED TO SAY
SOMETHING TO YOU.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.422
I JUST‐‐

24:25.464 --> 24:26.882
I WANTED TO TELL YOU
THAT I THOUGHT ABOUT

24:26.924 --> 24:30.469
WHAT YOU SAID THE OTHER NIGHT,
AND...

24:30.469 --> 24:31.470
AND THAT YOU WERE RIGHT.

24:31.512 --> 24:35.391
AND THAT I WAS WRONG.

24:35.432 --> 24:39.645
AND...I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

24:39.645 --> 24:41.397
I JUST‐‐
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE

24:41.438 --> 24:45.776
FOR, LIKE, EVERYTHING.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.486
AND TO TELL YOU
THAT I'M SORRY,

24:47.486 --> 24:49.488
AND I'M REALLY SORRY
I HURT YOU.

24:49.530 --> 24:50.823
OH...

24:50.823 --> 24:53.492
THANKS.

24:53.534 --> 24:55.327
AND I JUST HOPE
YOU COULD FORGIVE ME,

24:55.369 --> 24:57.538
AND, YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE COULD
BE FRIENDS OR SOMETHING.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.502
YEAH, ME‐‐
ME TOO.

25:03.502 --> 25:06.505
I GUESS I'LL JUST SEE YOU
AROUND, OKAY?

25:06.547 --> 25:08.424
OKAY.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.226
(Lyla)
HELLO, REVEREND.

25:19.268 --> 25:21.478
I'M PROUD OF YOU, LYLA.
THANK YOU.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.480
AND I'M PRAYING FOR YOU
EVERY DAY.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.154
(Street)
HI.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.989
HELLO.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.950
YOU GOT A SECOND?

25:34.992 --> 25:36.869
YEAH, OF COURSE.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.454
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE PARTY
TONIGHT.

25:38.495 --> 25:39.538
OH, PLEASE DON'T MENTION IT.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.248
[chuckling]

25:41.248 --> 25:42.916
ANYBODY THAT I'VE EVER SAID
"HELLO" TO IN MY LIFE

25:42.958 --> 25:46.003
MY MOM HAS INVITED
TO MY BIRTHDAY PARTY TONIGHT.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.171
YEAH, WELL...

25:47.212 --> 25:50.382
WHAT'S UP?

25:50.424 --> 25:52.468
YOU EVER NOTICE
HOW NO ONE EVER CHANGES

25:52.509 --> 25:53.552
IN THIS TOWN?

25:53.594 --> 25:55.387
NOTHING EVER CHANGES.

25:55.429 --> 25:57.389
EVERYONE GOES
TO THE SAME CHURCH,

25:57.431 --> 25:59.391
OR SAME JOB,

25:59.433 --> 26:00.267
AND SAME RESTAURANTS.

26:00.309 --> 26:01.393
AND EVERYBODY GOES
TO A FOOTBALL GAME

26:01.435 --> 26:02.561
ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.729
AND IT'S LIKE THIS

26:03.729 --> 26:06.398
HUGE FISH TANK
THAT WE'RE ALL STUCK IN,

26:06.440 --> 26:10.569
AND YOU CAN'T FIND
A WAY OUT.

26:10.611 --> 26:12.905
WELL I'M KIND OF‐‐
I'M STUCK.

26:12.905 --> 26:16.742
I'M STUCK.

26:16.742 --> 26:19.536
WELL THERE'S A WAY TO‐‐
‐ NO, NO, NO‐‐

26:19.578 --> 26:21.455
NO, I KNOW‐‐
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

26:21.497 --> 26:23.707
AND NO, I DON'T NEED SAVING.

26:23.749 --> 26:24.792
I'M NOT HERE TO TALK
TO GOD, OKAY?

26:24.833 --> 26:27.753
I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU.

26:27.795 --> 26:29.088
'CAUSE OUT OF EVERYONE
I KNOW,

26:29.088 --> 26:30.589
YOU'RE JUST ABOUT
THE ONLY ONE

26:30.589 --> 26:31.924
THAT'S CHANGED THEIR LIFE.

26:31.965 --> 26:34.510
AND I ADMIRE IT.

26:34.551 --> 26:39.473
AND I WAS JUST WONDERING
HOW YOU DID IT.

26:41.475 --> 26:45.479
YOU JUST DO IT.

26:48.982 --> 26:50.943
WHAT I'M SAYING IS
COACH TAYLOR

26:50.943 --> 26:52.111
NEEDS TO SEE YOU
TAKE IT UP A NOTCH.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.612
I'VE SAID WHAT I COULD
TO THE COACH.

26:53.612 --> 26:54.613
HE SAID, "NO."

26:54.655 --> 26:55.697
IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS.

26:55.739 --> 26:56.615
SO WHAT, THAT'S IT?

26:56.657 --> 26:58.450
YOU JUST GONNA...
GIVE UP?

26:58.492 --> 26:59.910
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
TO TELL YOU.

26:59.952 --> 27:00.953
HE SAID NO.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.704
OOH, GOD, MY SISTER
CAN TALK!

27:02.746 --> 27:04.790
OKAY, TIM, YOU READY
FOR A PIECE OF PIE FOR DESSERT?

27:04.832 --> 27:05.833
YES, MA'AM.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.626
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.627
OH, NOW YOU WANT PIE.

27:08.669 --> 27:09.670
HOW CAN I SAY NO?

27:09.711 --> 27:11.046
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
YOU FLIRTIN' WITH MY MAMA.

27:11.088 --> 27:12.589
BRIAN!

27:12.631 --> 27:13.632
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
‐ IT'S BEING POLITE.

27:13.632 --> 27:14.800
EXACTLY.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.552
LOOK...

27:16.593 --> 27:17.886
WE A LOT DIFFERENT,
YOU AND ME.

27:17.928 --> 27:19.805
ME‐‐I'M THE SMASH.

27:19.847 --> 27:21.974
I'M THROAT.
I'M PRIME TIME, 24/7.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.642
RIGHT.

27:23.642 --> 27:24.643
AND YOU‐‐YOU KNOW,

27:24.685 --> 27:26.937
YOU THAT BROODIN'...

27:26.979 --> 27:28.480
ROUGH...

27:28.522 --> 27:29.648
WHATEVER.

27:29.690 --> 27:30.732
LOOK, THE POINT IS

27:30.774 --> 27:32.568
NEITHER OF US CAN BE
WHO WE ARE

27:32.609 --> 27:34.570
WITHOUT FOOTBALL.

27:34.611 --> 27:36.822
IT'S THE KEYS
TO THE IGNITION.

27:36.822 --> 27:40.158
AND IF YOU DON'T FIGHT
FOR THAT,

27:40.158 --> 27:42.077
YOU'RE JUST WASTING
A WHOLE LOT OF POTENTIAL,

27:42.119 --> 27:44.580
THAT'S ALL.

27:44.621 --> 27:46.665
OH, MAMA, COME ON!
I WANTED APPLE PIE.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.641
[door slams]

28:04.683 --> 28:06.184
GEE, DAD,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:06.226 --> 28:09.646
WE'RE NOT GOING INSIDE.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.857
THEY FOUND BLOOD RESIDUE
OUTSIDE THE CONVENIENCE STORE.

28:11.857 --> 28:15.027
MATCHES UP WITH THE DEAD GUY.

28:15.068 --> 28:16.278
BASED ON THE HEAD WOUND,

28:16.320 --> 28:18.030
THEY FIGURE THAT

28:18.030 --> 28:19.114
HE WAS PROBABLY STRUCK THERE

28:19.156 --> 28:20.949
WITH SOME SORT
OF HARD OBJECT

28:20.991 --> 28:23.327
AND THEN PUT IN A CAR,

28:23.368 --> 28:24.328
EITHER UNCONSCIOUS
OR DEAD,

28:24.369 --> 28:26.663
THEN TAKEN TO THE BRIDGE
AND DUMPED IN THE RIVER.

28:28.749 --> 28:29.750
WELL I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.710
THE WATER AND THE FISH

28:31.752 --> 28:34.630
PRETTY MUCH DID AWAY
WITH ANY FOREIGN DNA

28:34.671 --> 28:36.673
OR PRINTS THAT COULD'VE LEAD
TO SUSPECTS.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.342
AND WITH NO WITNESSES,

28:38.383 --> 28:42.679
THE DETECTIVES DON'T HAVE MUCH,

28:42.721 --> 28:44.848
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.

28:46.058 --> 28:50.020
THE CORONER FOUND
UPHOLSTERY FIBERS

28:50.062 --> 28:51.897
IN THE ZIPPER

28:51.939 --> 28:53.732
OF THE DECEASED'S JACKET.

28:53.732 --> 28:57.736
AND GUESS
WHERE THEY COME FROM?

28:57.736 --> 28:59.905
FROM GMC WAGONS,

28:59.905 --> 29:01.073
JUST LIKE THIS ONE.

29:01.073 --> 29:04.660
YEAH, WELL THAT...

29:04.701 --> 29:06.328
I‐I‐I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
THAT YOU'RE THINKING,

29:06.370 --> 29:07.371
BUT THAT MEANS‐‐

29:07.412 --> 29:08.622
HOW‐‐HOW MANY DIFFERENT‐‐

29:08.664 --> 29:10.290
HOW MANY DIFFERENT GMC WAGONS‐‐

29:10.290 --> 29:13.210
LANDRY, IF YOU HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THIS,

29:13.251 --> 29:17.255
YOU HAVE GOT TO TELL ME
RIGHT NOW.

29:17.255 --> 29:19.091
BETTER YOU TELL ME

29:19.091 --> 29:20.592
THEN WAIT FOR THEM
TO DRAG YOU IN,

29:20.634 --> 29:21.760
BECAUSE, SO HELP ME GOD, SON,

29:21.802 --> 29:23.887
THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN!

29:28.934 --> 29:30.394
TALK TO ME.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.273
TIME TO TRUST ME.

29:45.909 --> 29:49.121
I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT,
DAD.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.832
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.626
IT JUST HAPPENED.

29:54.668 --> 29:56.294
OH, GOD.

29:56.294 --> 29:59.798
I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.258
OH, GOD, LANDRY.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.968
[sobbing]

30:02.968 --> 30:06.972
OKAY, LISTEN TO ME.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.640
WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO TAKE A DRIVE.

30:08.682 --> 30:12.310
RIGHT NOW.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.812
WELL...WHERE?

30:13.854 --> 30:16.815
GET IN THE CAR.

30:16.815 --> 30:17.816
FOLLOW ME.

30:17.816 --> 30:18.734
RIGHT NOW.

30:18.775 --> 30:20.777
YES, SIR.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.321
LET'S GO.

30:23.321 --> 30:25.407
[car door opens]

30:30.829 --> 30:31.872
(Street)
THIS IS GOOD PROTECTION,

30:31.913 --> 30:33.206
GOOD BLOCKING
BY EVERYBODY.

30:33.206 --> 30:35.042
NICE LITTLE PUNT FAKE.

30:35.042 --> 30:36.793
[crowd chatters approvingly]

30:36.835 --> 30:38.170
(Riggins)
SPEAKING OF GOOD BLOCKING,
WILLIAMS.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.337
WHAT JUST HAPPENED THERE?

30:39.379 --> 30:40.839
(Street)
SMASH WILLIAMS.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.090
HE'S OUR NUMBER ONE WIDEOUT
ACTUALLY.

30:42.132 --> 30:44.176
HE ALWAYS IS CATCHING
THE LONG PUNT.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.510
HEY, BRADLEY, THAT‐‐

30:45.510 --> 30:46.511
OH, THERE WE GO.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.013
BRADLEY HIKED IT ON TWO

30:48.013 --> 30:49.765
AND THAT SNAP WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE ON THREE.

30:49.806 --> 30:52.434
BRADLEY‐‐BRADLEY CAN'T COUNT
THAT HIGH.

30:52.476 --> 30:53.977
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

30:54.019 --> 30:54.978
WE STILL WON THAT GAME
THOUGH.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.313
WE STILL WON THAT GAME
BY 12.

30:56.354 --> 30:57.856
HERE IT IS.

30:57.856 --> 30:58.857
WATCH HIM, HERE HE COMES.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.859
WATCH HIM, WATCH HIM!

31:00.901 --> 31:02.152
WATCH HIS WHEELS.
HERE HE GOES.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.361
HERE HE GOES.

31:03.361 --> 31:04.863

31:04.863 --> 31:05.947
WATCH HIM GO!

31:05.989 --> 31:07.866
[excited chattering]

31:07.866 --> 31:10.202
[cheering]

31:11.870 --> 31:13.914
620 YARDS THAT DAY!
BROKE THE RECORD!

31:13.914 --> 31:16.166
(Buddy)
YEAH, WE COULD'VE BEEN
A DYNASTY KID.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.502
AND THEN LYLA
WOULD'VE BEEN RICH.

31:18.543 --> 31:19.878
DAD!
‐ WHAT?

31:19.878 --> 31:20.879
NO, HE'S RIGHT.

31:20.879 --> 31:21.880
HE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW?

31:21.880 --> 31:23.465
YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL,

31:23.507 --> 31:24.883
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE IT
ALL AT ONCE.

31:24.883 --> 31:25.717
SO, YOU KNOW, YOU TAKE
YOUR MEMORIES

31:25.717 --> 31:27.219
WHERE YOU CAN GET 'EM,

CHEERS.

31:38.438 --> 31:41.900
(Lauren)
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE,
YOU KNOW?

31:41.942 --> 31:44.236
AT MY OLD SCHOOL,

31:44.277 --> 31:45.862
MY BOYFRIEND AND I BROKE UP

31:45.904 --> 31:46.738
FOR INEXPLICABLE REASONS.

31:46.738 --> 31:50.826
BUT EVERY SINGLE TIME
I WOULD SEE HIM,

31:50.867 --> 31:52.911
I WOULD GET THESE PAINS
IN MY HEART.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.288
LIKE...

31:55.288 --> 31:56.915
SOMEONE WAS STABBING IT
WITH, LIKE, A‐‐

31:56.957 --> 31:58.125
LIKE WITH A KNIFE.

31:58.125 --> 32:00.335

32:00.377 --> 32:01.962
LIKE‐‐LIKE A SHIV.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.339
WHAT?

32:04.381 --> 32:06.091
ACTUALLY...

32:06.133 --> 32:09.594
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT A SHIV IS.

32:09.594 --> 32:10.512
SO YOU MEAN, LIKE‐‐

32:10.554 --> 32:12.430
LIKE A SHANK, LIKE WHAT THEY USE
