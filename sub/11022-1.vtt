WEBVTT

02:52.534 --> 02:54.469
You join us
live outside the state prison...

02:54.536 --> 02:56.672
to witness the arrival
of Nathan and Erin Randall,

02:56.738 --> 03:00.642
the father and sister
of the murdered Lauren Randall.

03:00.708 --> 03:03.478
The impending state execution of
Alex Corvis may provide the Randalls,

03:03.545 --> 03:07.783
and what seems the majority of this
crowd, with some form of justice.

03:07.849 --> 03:11.786
- Why are there so many?
-Just hold on to me.

03:14.355 --> 03:16.158
Back, back.

03:16.224 --> 03:20.361
Mr. Randall, sir, do
you think this execution...

03:20.428 --> 03:22.530
will bring you a sense of closure
for you and your daughter?

03:22.597 --> 03:25.900
Erin, your sister has been
gone for three years now.

03:25.967 --> 03:28.036
Can you tell us anything?

03:32.808 --> 03:35.211
A difficult time
for everyone involved.

03:35.277 --> 03:38.980
Interesting fact: It will take
about 21 cents of electricity...

03:39.047 --> 03:42.985
to execute Alex Corvis tonight,
on this, his 21st birthday.

03:52.861 --> 03:55.898
He didn't order that.

03:55.965 --> 03:59.101
We found the man
with the scar.

04:02.671 --> 04:05.107
Go ahead,
make a wish.

04:07.676 --> 04:10.212
Get it out of here.

04:22.525 --> 04:24.793
Oh, yes, I've come to a lot
of these over the years,

04:24.860 --> 04:28.797
but this one has, well,
many unique aspects.

04:28.864 --> 04:33.703
The youth of the condemned.
Now, that's unusual.

04:33.770 --> 04:37.740
And 53 stab wounds!
Hmph! Kind of a record.

04:56.725 --> 05:00.997
- And Corvis still
maintaining his innocence?
- Oh, they all say that.

05:01.064 --> 05:05.067
I saw those two fighting that day.
Facing the chair,
you do what you gotta do.

05:08.537 --> 05:10.773
You okay?

05:15.412 --> 05:17.914
What's been
holding me together...

05:17.981 --> 05:21.951
is the hope that maybe
you do go someplace.

05:23.987 --> 05:27.022
I'll be seein' her
again soon, you know.

05:30.025 --> 05:32.795
Only what can I say?

05:32.863 --> 05:37.868
That I was too stupid
to find the guy that killed her?

05:37.934 --> 05:40.870
That he's down here laughin'?

05:43.039 --> 05:46.176
Tell her...
we'll get him.

05:48.311 --> 05:50.347
"We" won't.

05:52.149 --> 05:57.554
Someday he'll surface,
and I'll get him for both of you.

05:57.621 --> 06:01.558
I promise.
I'll find the guy with the scar.

06:04.694 --> 06:07.764
This mystery man with the scar,
the zigzag, whatever?

06:07.831 --> 06:11.768
We couldn't find him.
Obviously the jury didn't buy it.

06:11.835 --> 06:13.938
-Some people here seem to.
- Look.

06:14.005 --> 06:17.841
People here are protesting
execution of a kid turned 21 .

06:17.841 --> 06:22.113
A kid who had a tough life.
No parents, no dough,
always had to fight for everything.

06:22.180 --> 06:25.016
It's a tragedy.
It really is.

06:28.985 --> 06:31.788
If I was facing the hot seat,
I'd want my attorney...

06:31.855 --> 06:35.059
banging down the door to the Supreme
Court, not playing some board game.

06:35.126 --> 06:37.895
But maybe that's just me.

06:43.101 --> 06:45.435
Your move.

06:48.439 --> 06:50.574
No. It's time.

07:19.103 --> 07:21.406
I don't want you to watch.

07:21.472 --> 07:24.442
I don't want to give 'em
the pleasure.

07:26.045 --> 07:28.212
Come on now.

07:57.708 --> 08:00.979
"The Lord
is my shepherd, I shall not want.

08:01.046 --> 08:04.683
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

08:04.750 --> 08:07.986
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

08:09.221 --> 08:13.025
He restoreth my soul.

08:13.092 --> 08:17.529
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for His name's sake.

08:17.529 --> 08:22.467
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

08:22.534 --> 08:24.802
I will fear no evil...

08:24.869 --> 08:27.805
for Thou art with me.

08:27.872 --> 08:31.043
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

08:31.110 --> 08:35.047
Thou preparest a table
before me...

08:35.114 --> 08:37.549
in the presence
of mine enemies.

08:37.616 --> 08:41.787
Thou anointest my head
with oil.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.789
My cup runneth over.

08:43.856 --> 08:48.027
Surely goodness and mercy...

08:48.093 --> 08:50.429
shall follow me...

08:50.496 --> 08:53.599
all the days of my life...

08:53.665 --> 08:58.504
and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever."

09:12.718 --> 09:17.457
Alexander Frederick Corvis,
do you have any last words?

09:24.564 --> 09:27.200
I loved Lauren.

09:28.767 --> 09:31.037
I still do.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.309
I'm innocent.

10:51.519 --> 10:54.121
Murderer!

11:45.706 --> 11:47.742
Look at that.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.511
Goddamn helmet
melted his skin off.

11:50.578 --> 11:52.814
That's what I call
a deterrent.

11:54.649 --> 11:57.151
Oops.

11:57.218 --> 12:00.989
Why do they bother
autopsying these guys?

12:01.056 --> 12:04.525
I mean, the cause of death
is pretty fucking obvious.

12:12.467 --> 12:15.803
Go on to the car,
honey. Go on.

12:15.803 --> 12:19.942
Mr. Randall, we all wish this
would have ended better, sir.

14:39.449 --> 14:42.051
We've got unauthorized
movement on B-5.

15:15.986 --> 15:21.758
I repeat. Unauthorized movement, B-4,
B-2, all of section " B" and section "C."

15:23.594 --> 15:26.564
We have an escape in progress.
I repeat, an escape in progress.

15:26.630 --> 15:29.900
- Mercer, are you down there?
- This is Mercer. I'm on it.

15:29.967 --> 15:33.403
They're heading
for the roof.

16:25.090 --> 16:27.358
All prisoners present and accounted for.

16:27.425 --> 16:30.529
Then who's fucking Houdini?

17:13.505 --> 17:17.776
- What? Police? Evidence?

17:57.916 --> 18:01.286
There's nothing
under "Crow."

18:16.335 --> 18:19.704
" Execution"?

18:21.641 --> 18:23.709
- Lauren!

18:42.462 --> 18:45.765
What are you trying
to say here?

18:49.035 --> 18:51.771
I'm all yours.

19:39.486 --> 19:41.455
His knife!

19:42.790 --> 19:45.692
- Corvis.
-  You lie!

19:45.759 --> 19:48.195
You lie!

20:05.212 --> 20:07.681
Thomas Leonard.

20:28.635 --> 20:30.571
Shit.

21:15.082 --> 21:18.285
I thought
I'd be with you now.

21:23.190 --> 21:25.927
I'm not dead.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.463
And I'm not alive.

21:30.098 --> 21:32.667
And I'm remembering.

21:32.734 --> 21:34.803
And it hurts.

21:36.838 --> 21:40.842
Your Shaolin style
is no match for my kung fu.

21:43.945 --> 21:46.815
Your flying crane style...

21:49.250 --> 21:52.253
is no match for
my drunken tiger kick.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.422
Aww.

21:54.489 --> 21:58.393
Your mad monkey love...

21:58.460 --> 22:00.462
is no match--

22:03.398 --> 22:06.101
I can't be alive.

22:06.167 --> 22:08.269
Not without you.

22:11.873 --> 22:14.409
I want to be with you
forever.

22:14.409 --> 22:19.514
- I want to be with you forever.
- Only forever?

23:43.199 --> 23:47.137
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

23:47.204 --> 23:49.105
Don't come near me!

23:49.171 --> 23:53.210
- I was a friend of your sister's.
- I know her friends.

23:53.277 --> 23:58.048
That locket
you're holding.

23:58.115 --> 24:00.717
- You have one just like it.
- No kidding.

24:00.784 --> 24:02.886
Your father gave them
to both of you.

24:02.953 --> 24:06.056
He's right over there
by the way.

24:06.123 --> 24:08.926
What did you do
to your face?

24:08.992 --> 24:13.964
- Someone else did it.
- You're a friend of the guy
who killed Lauren, aren't you?

24:14.031 --> 24:17.067
- You almost sound like him.
- He didn't kill her.

24:17.067 --> 24:22.673
- How do you know?
- I know everything about your sister.

24:22.739 --> 24:25.275
I'll prove it to you.

24:25.342 --> 24:28.111
Stay away from me!
Dad!

24:29.179 --> 24:31.181
Dad!

24:32.316 --> 24:34.785
- Dad.
- Are you all right?

24:34.851 --> 24:38.455
There's this guy.
He said he was a friend of Lauren's.
He had paint all over his face.

24:38.522 --> 24:40.791
He was here!

24:40.857 --> 24:42.893
He was right here!

25:58.002 --> 25:59.504
Marcy!

26:02.640 --> 26:06.244
She's resting, Thomas.

26:07.445 --> 26:09.614
Where the fuck
did you come from?

26:09.681 --> 26:13.818
Big bang, primordial ooze?

26:13.885 --> 26:16.688
Divine hand
ofa benevolent creator?

26:16.688 --> 26:20.625
All possibilities. Although,
recent events have given me doubts...

26:20.692 --> 26:23.795
about the
benevolent creator.

26:23.861 --> 26:28.132
- You lied at my trial, Thomas.
- I don't even know you, man.

26:28.200 --> 26:32.604
Capital case 99-C1 1 5.

26:32.670 --> 26:36.074
Alex Corvis!

26:37.542 --> 26:40.079
Exhibit "A."

26:40.144 --> 26:43.781
Hey, I said what I saw.
Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.

26:43.848 --> 26:46.784
No, you said you saw me
with this.

26:47.887 --> 26:50.256
I never held it
until today.

26:50.322 --> 26:55.094
What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked
up that girl like a motherfucker!

27:02.533 --> 27:06.772
One chance to tell
the truth, Tommy.

27:07.840 --> 27:11.977
Who is the man
with the scar?

27:12.044 --> 27:15.247
He planted this
in my car.

27:15.247 --> 27:18.150
There's no scar.
Corvis made it up.

27:18.217 --> 27:20.686
Wrong answer!

27:22.988 --> 27:27.259
They showed me pictures,
what he did to her.

27:27.326 --> 27:29.795
Evidence.

27:29.862 --> 27:34.099
Said all I had to do was
stand up there and nod my head "yes."

27:34.166 --> 27:37.002
What did they give you?

27:37.069 --> 27:39.038
Ajob!

27:40.539 --> 27:42.641
Construction.

27:43.710 --> 27:48.781
Twelve an hour.

27:52.252 --> 27:54.488
Write their names down.

27:57.324 --> 27:59.725
You've already got 'em all
right here.

27:59.793 --> 28:03.562
These cops said they needed
an eyewitness or Corvis would walk.

28:44.571 --> 28:46.640
Oh.

28:51.578 --> 28:53.513
Is there a problem?

28:53.579 --> 28:56.383
Let's hope not.

28:56.449 --> 29:00.453
- License and registration, please.
- Yeah.

29:01.689 --> 29:04.124
What's with
your friend there?

29:04.191 --> 29:06.259
She's sick.

29:07.761 --> 29:10.430
- Actually, she never had
Mai Tais before.
- But you've had 'em.

29:10.497 --> 29:14.868
Oh, not tonight.
Honest.

29:14.868 --> 29:17.604
If you had a license,
I bet I'd have seen it by now.

29:17.671 --> 29:20.373
How old are you?
What?

29:20.440 --> 29:22.275
Fifteen?

29:25.378 --> 29:29.350
Look, I'll tell you the truth.
Jannie drove us and
was supposed to drive us back.

29:29.417 --> 29:34.889
She has a license, but--
I mean, look at her.

29:38.058 --> 29:41.161
Jannie, get up.
Come on, get up!

29:41.228 --> 29:43.464
Getup!

30:00.081 --> 30:03.049
Why don't you get out?

30:10.892 --> 30:13.194
Want me to walk
a straight line?

30:18.733 --> 30:20.968
- I want you to bend over.
- Can I just call a cab?

30:21.035 --> 30:23.237
What'd I say?

30:38.854 --> 30:40.988
Very nice.

30:45.393 --> 30:48.296
Maybe I'll just ask
your friend here.

31:04.245 --> 31:07.381
I want you to bend over,
Officer Dutton.

31:07.448 --> 31:12.620
What the fuck did you--
Get out of the car. Now!

31:12.687 --> 31:14.623
Hey, punk!

31:22.498 --> 31:25.667
- Get your hands on the car.
- These hands?

31:25.734 --> 31:29.037
You're dead, ditch weed.

31:29.104 --> 31:31.440
Oh, my God!

31:33.942 --> 31:37.912
- You're up!

31:43.752 --> 31:47.289
Ladies, drive carefully.

31:51.760 --> 31:53.862
You might want to call 9-1 -1 .

31:54.863 --> 31:57.266
Report an officer down.

32:04.807 --> 32:07.677
That was a fucking
hollow point!

32:07.744 --> 32:12.114
Guess it's true.
Guns don't kill people.

32:12.181 --> 32:14.616
Think, uh,
like maybe knives do?

32:14.616 --> 32:17.753
Keep that thing
away from me.

32:17.820 --> 32:23.659
Phillip, this is not
just some "thing."

32:23.727 --> 32:27.530
It's "AC-005."

32:29.132 --> 32:32.736
You're the skell that broke into
the evidence room.

32:35.071 --> 32:38.141
Fuck!
What do you want?

32:38.208 --> 32:41.810
A scar
on the arm...

32:41.877 --> 32:45.047
of the man who planted this
in Alex Corvis's car.

32:45.114 --> 32:49.386
There was no scar, you freak.
The Corvis kid made it up.

33:10.607 --> 33:14.144
He was innocent.
You killed him!

33:14.210 --> 33:17.180
You and Erlich
and Roberts and Toomey.

33:18.415 --> 33:20.850
What do you think,
Officer Dutton, huh?

33:20.917 --> 33:22.886
An eye for an eye?

33:31.027 --> 33:34.364
- Get her!

33:42.706 --> 33:46.509
You were there?

33:48.145 --> 33:50.081
All four of you?

33:51.147 --> 33:53.950
You killed her!
I saw it!

33:54.017 --> 33:56.487
Bitch killed herself
when she shot a cop in the foot.

33:56.553 --> 33:59.556
If she had just shut up and acted like
a girl, nothing would have happened.

33:59.622 --> 34:03.059
So you're right, spooky.
You happy?

34:11.534 --> 34:14.672
I'm working on it.

36:32.145 --> 36:36.682
- Police!
- Fuck! What the fuck?

36:36.748 --> 36:39.418
Don't do that, man.

36:39.484 --> 36:43.089
That's fuckin' really cool.
Thank you.

36:43.156 --> 36:46.625
So, how'd the month
end up?

36:46.725 --> 36:49.494
- Fantastic.
- Yeah.
- Never been better.

36:49.561 --> 36:51.598
Where's Dutton?

36:51.664 --> 36:55.233
Probably parked in front of
some high school with a hard-on.
The fuck never showed up.

36:57.269 --> 37:00.739
- You know why Dutton's not here?
- No.

37:00.839 --> 37:04.744
Rigor mortis.
Dead!

37:04.811 --> 37:07.413
One shot to the head.

37:07.480 --> 37:10.783
Then 53 stab wounds
with a six-inch blade.

37:12.418 --> 37:14.620
This cause any kind of deja vu
for you guys?

37:17.255 --> 37:22.694
Rumors multiply as police
refuse to confirm or deny reports
of multiple, multiple stab wounds.

37:22.762 --> 37:25.632
- Dad, come in here.
- Yeah, what is it, honey?

37:25.698 --> 37:30.403
- That cop who found
the knife in Corvis's car.
-  They're moving him now.

37:30.470 --> 37:36.009
Body covered. It would appear
that 37-year-old Phillip Dutton
is dead in the line of duty.

37:37.076 --> 37:39.646
Let's go.

37:39.712 --> 37:42.482
Watch her. What are you doing?

37:42.548 --> 37:47.353
Get back behind the line.
Get back there right now.

37:47.420 --> 37:49.890
It's shocking,
even for these mean streets.

37:49.990 --> 37:54.394
The word "Daisy"
carved into his forehead
by the perpetrator still at large.

37:54.460 --> 37:57.030
A name?
Perhaps a message.

37:57.096 --> 38:00.266
What's the matter, honey?

38:00.333 --> 38:03.704
Lauren used to call me that
when we were little.

38:03.771 --> 38:06.140
Daisy.

38:06.207 --> 38:08.676
Nobody knew but us.

38:08.776 --> 38:12.912
Honey, it doesn't mean anything.
It's not a message.

38:12.979 --> 38:16.015
No, that guy at the cemetery said
he knew everything about Lauren.

38:16.015 --> 38:18.551
It still doesn't
mean anything.

38:18.618 --> 38:20.787
He said he'd prove it.

38:37.403 --> 38:39.807
Come on,
you're hiding something!

38:39.874 --> 38:42.109
I don't know anything
about any knife.

38:42.176 --> 38:46.347
- I'm tryin' to forget that case.
- Well, someone isn't.
They killed Dutton.

38:46.413 --> 38:49.049
- It wasn't me.
- No shit.
You couldn't get close to him.

38:49.116 --> 38:53.087
But I am betting...
that you know who did.

38:53.187 --> 38:56.390
You're the only one who gave a flying
fuck about him when he was alive.

38:56.457 --> 38:58.526
- Lauren Randall did.
- Yeah, well, bitches are crazy.

38:58.592 --> 39:01.962
The richer they are,
the crazier they get.

39:02.029 --> 39:05.966
Yeah? Maybe if you hadn't
fried an innocent kid--

39:08.102 --> 39:10.471
Who is it?
Who is it?

39:10.539 --> 39:12.907
Maybe it's the real killer.
Did you ever think of that? Huh?

39:15.276 --> 39:19.847
If you're covering up for someone,
that's jail time.
I've got my eye on you.

39:46.608 --> 39:49.110
Queen to bishop five.

40:00.655 --> 40:02.023
"Check."

41:13.762 --> 41:17.700
Don't move.

41:38.353 --> 41:40.956
Fuck me.

41:49.397 --> 41:52.702
I heard you were looking
for this.

41:52.768 --> 41:54.803
You're the guy
who killed Dutton.

41:54.871 --> 41:57.707
The way I see it,

41:57.774 --> 42:01.177
I want you to think of me
as the guy who killed you.

42:01.244 --> 42:03.179
I'm a police officer, man!

42:03.246 --> 42:08.552
Yeah? What happened
to your leg there, Officer?

42:08.618 --> 42:11.121
Is that like
a hunting accident, huh?

42:16.292 --> 42:20.830
Lauren Randall shot you
trying to get free.

42:20.897 --> 42:24.300
The 53 stab wounds
she died of came from you!

42:24.367 --> 42:27.204
Am I right?
Ballpark?

42:28.438 --> 42:32.175
What the fuck do you want?

42:32.241 --> 42:38.048
I want Lauren! I want my life back!
I wanna know why!

42:38.115 --> 42:42.351
It's all money, man!
The girl just got in the way.

42:42.418 --> 42:45.755
The scar.
Which of you has it?

42:45.822 --> 42:50.260
Nobody. It's just a bullshit fucking
story the loser boyfriend made up.

44:16.780 --> 44:19.883
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
We're gonna die!

44:19.950 --> 44:22.920
How can you die
if you're already dead?

44:24.855 --> 44:28.460
You're him... Corvis.

45:39.799 --> 45:41.767
Go, go!
C'mon!

46:58.010 --> 47:01.982
Here, here, take it.
Fuck!

47:34.080 --> 47:38.018
Daisy.
How did you know?

47:38.118 --> 47:41.421
I told you.
I knew her.

47:41.488 --> 47:44.758
You killed that cop,
Dutton.

47:44.825 --> 47:46.994
And another one.

47:48.161 --> 47:50.597
Erlich.
Took a wrong turn.

47:50.664 --> 47:53.934
I know who you are.

47:55.669 --> 47:59.573
That's why
you paint your face.

47:59.640 --> 48:01.576
To hide.

48:01.643 --> 48:03.878
I'm not hiding.

48:03.945 --> 48:06.013
I'm right here.

48:07.648 --> 48:10.083
You killed Lauren!
You killed her!

48:10.150 --> 48:14.521
Not me! Dirty cops killed her.
Dutton and Erlich!

48:18.259 --> 48:22.129
My dad was right.
He said you'd ruin her life.

48:22.195 --> 48:24.698
No!
Listen to me!

48:24.798 --> 48:28.603
Lauren found out something
they didn't want her to know. This!

48:28.670 --> 48:30.905
Look at it.

48:32.173 --> 48:34.142
Look at it.

48:36.377 --> 48:39.047
Because you need
to understand.

48:40.614 --> 48:44.117
You need to be careful.

48:49.691 --> 48:52.760
I'm sorry.

48:52.827 --> 48:56.564
Your father...
wasn't right.

49:29.631 --> 49:33.068
All right, all right!
Listen up!

49:36.604 --> 49:38.941
Yo!

49:40.642 --> 49:42.610
We've got a cop killer
out there.

49:42.677 --> 49:45.179
Till we get some I.D.,
treat everyone like a suspect.

49:45.280 --> 49:48.016
He knows. I saw him.
He's got a fucking zombie mask.

49:48.082 --> 49:50.019
- Calm down.
- No, you calm down!

49:50.085 --> 49:54.122
Whose name's next on the fucking list,
huh? It's not yours.

49:54.188 --> 49:57.826
You didn't testify.
You're not on the list.

49:59.060 --> 50:01.529
- Scary guy.
- Yeah, scary.

50:01.596 --> 50:04.899
He survives that crash,
takes time out for art?

50:04.966 --> 50:07.970
Madden, the old man's requested
the pleasure of your company.

50:10.573 --> 50:14.510
All right, boys and girls, to quote John
Wilkes Booth, "Just watch your backs."

50:24.620 --> 50:28.057
- Glad I'm not you.
- Right back at ya.

50:35.631 --> 50:37.566
Sit down.

50:40.903 --> 50:43.606
I thought we had
an understanding.

50:43.672 --> 50:46.842
I thought we understood
that discretion is paramount.

50:46.909 --> 50:51.914
- Yeah, we do.
- Shut up!

50:52.014 --> 50:57.453
Erlich gimping around in his
goddamn hot rod is not discreet.

50:57.519 --> 51:01.223
I've got reporters
asking me how much he made.

51:01.290 --> 51:03.893
I've got the entire force
looking at this case now.

51:03.959 --> 51:06.862
- I know.
- You know.

51:06.929 --> 51:11.400
I know... the guy,
he leaves a sign.

51:11.500 --> 51:15.438
No shit he leaves a sign!
He's goddamn Picasso.

51:16.705 --> 51:19.308
What else do you know?

51:22.478 --> 51:25.447
You know this?

51:30.619 --> 51:34.591
Tommy Leonard.
The eyewitness in the Corvis case.

51:34.691 --> 51:38.928
Some hooker phoned it in. There was
a riot at his apartment yesterday.

51:38.994 --> 51:44.300
- Guy dressed for Halloween?
- Good for you. You do know something.

51:46.636 --> 51:51.575
Don't... say.
Just do.

51:53.710 --> 51:56.713
Before this whole thing
comes tumbling down.

52:13.230 --> 52:16.967
- Idiots.

52:37.287 --> 52:39.290
What are you doing?

52:41.258 --> 52:44.195
Um, I dropped
an earring.

52:44.262 --> 52:48.465
Well, it looks like
you've got them both on.

52:58.810 --> 53:02.212
Alex Corvis
didn't kill Lauren.

53:02.279 --> 53:04.915
Cops did,
didn't they?

53:07.717 --> 53:09.654
You're in with them.

53:09.720 --> 53:13.490
- It isn't what you think.
- You killed her!

53:13.557 --> 53:18.396
No! Erin!
It wasn't supposed to happen!

53:18.396 --> 53:22.834
- Stay away from me!
- Erin, please.
It wasn't supposed to happen.

53:23.901 --> 53:26.737
- She found out.
- About you?

53:26.804 --> 53:29.739
About them. You have to
leave this alone, sweetheart.

53:29.806 --> 53:31.843
Don't call me that!
Don't call me anything!

53:31.943 --> 53:34.512
I would never do anything
to hurt Lauren or you.

53:34.579 --> 53:37.081
- You have to believe me.
- I don't believe you.

53:37.181 --> 53:41.152
- Please.
- They killed Alex because of you, Dad.

53:41.252 --> 53:43.187
Now you killed
both of them.

53:46.291 --> 53:49.694
- Please, leave him alone.
- Get your hands off me.

53:49.760 --> 53:52.630
Calm down!
Put your hand down!

53:52.697 --> 53:56.667
- I'm not makin' this up.
He had a crow with him.
- That's what you're tellin' me.

53:56.769 --> 54:00.371
He said I lied at his trial.
It's Alex Corvis.

54:00.438 --> 54:02.908
So now we're talkin'
about a ghost...

54:03.008 --> 54:05.244
with a fuckin' pet bird,
is that right?

54:08.614 --> 54:12.383
- Turn that--
Turn that fuckin' baby down!

54:12.450 --> 54:17.889
- I wanna show you somethin'.
See this? See this here?

54:17.889 --> 54:21.994
Come here. I wanna show you something,
all right? See that?

54:22.060 --> 54:24.997
My name's next on his list.
It's fuckin' next.

54:25.063 --> 54:27.800
I want you to tell me
who it is, Tommy.

54:27.866 --> 54:31.870
- It's Corvis. It's Alex--
- Take your time.
I want you to think about it.

54:31.970 --> 54:35.107
'Cause you gotta give me something other
than this bullshit you been spewin'.

54:35.174 --> 54:38.143
He said the whole trial
was a setup.

54:38.210 --> 54:42.280
He said I caused an innocent kid
to die. Is that true?

54:42.346 --> 54:45.016
Is that true?

55:33.732 --> 55:35.667
Come on.

55:52.418 --> 55:55.388
Check... and mate.

55:56.589 --> 55:58.525
Dream on.

56:15.475 --> 56:19.913
Oh, my God.
That really is you under there.

56:20.013 --> 56:22.582
Two down.

56:22.649 --> 56:24.584
Two to go.

56:24.651 --> 56:26.586
Down?

56:28.354 --> 56:30.123
Wait, don't tell me.

56:30.190 --> 56:34.494
The cops...
at my trial.

56:34.561 --> 56:37.564
They killed Lauren.
The whole thing was fixed.

56:37.664 --> 56:40.266
You think I'm crazy.

56:42.969 --> 56:45.138
I'm thinking...
it explains a lot.

56:45.205 --> 56:48.074
Lauren's father
is involved.

56:48.141 --> 56:52.313
He bought these cops
fancy cars.

56:52.380 --> 56:55.815
And I don't know
what else.

56:55.882 --> 57:00.721
It's a company
called D-E-R-T.

57:00.788 --> 57:02.890
I think Lauren
found out.

57:02.957 --> 57:07.494
What-- What do they do
that they had to kill her?

57:07.560 --> 57:10.397
I was hoping
you'd find out.

57:11.632 --> 57:13.567
I sure will.

57:22.009 --> 57:25.279
What's with this bird?
Keeps hangin' around.

58:02.950 --> 58:06.020
This is where
it happened.

58:06.087 --> 58:08.889
Yeah, I know.

58:13.694 --> 58:16.130
Are you okay?

58:21.370 --> 58:24.106
When Lauren was missing,

58:24.172 --> 58:27.274
the cops came
to our house.

58:27.341 --> 58:30.311
They said they were looking
for her, right?

58:31.479 --> 58:34.081
But now I know
they had her.

58:34.148 --> 58:36.884
And the reason
they brought her here,

58:36.952 --> 58:41.722
and they knew they could blame it
on you, is that I sent them here!

58:41.789 --> 58:45.794
I told them she came here sometimes
with her dirtball boyfriend!

58:45.894 --> 58:49.298
That's exactly what I said!

58:49.364 --> 58:53.835
Erin, it's not your fault.

58:53.935 --> 58:57.239
Oh, God, I wish I were dead.

58:57.306 --> 59:01.343
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

59:03.477 --> 59:05.981
There were four of them!

59:10.619 --> 59:15.457
- Get her out of the car.

59:15.457 --> 59:19.127
- C'mon, baby.
- No! No! No!

59:19.194 --> 59:21.263
- Hold on. C'mon, baby!
- No! No!

59:21.330 --> 59:26.034
Be nice, would ya?
You wanna see a little somethin'?

59:26.101 --> 59:29.738
Four large men, and still
she grabbed one of their guns.

59:32.040 --> 59:35.911
And she ran.
She ran for her life!

59:35.978 --> 59:38.413
I don't wanna know!

59:38.480 --> 59:41.918
She ran, them breathing
down her neck...

59:41.985 --> 59:46.021
all the way
from the road...

59:46.121 --> 59:48.890
to here.

59:53.395 --> 59:55.331
Here's where it happened.

59:55.398 --> 59:58.368
She turned and faced them
and went down,

59:58.468 --> 01:00:01.170
kicking, and punching...

01:00:01.237 --> 01:00:03.973
and tearing at them
as they stabbed her.

01:00:05.574 --> 01:00:07.576
Fifty-three times.

01:00:25.962 --> 01:00:28.431
She fought
for her life...

01:00:28.531 --> 01:00:32.969
because life
is worth living.

01:00:33.069 --> 01:00:35.270
Think about that.

01:00:36.339 --> 01:00:38.508
Think about that.

01:00:38.574 --> 01:00:41.511
And you tell me how much
you wish you were dead.

01:00:55.992 --> 01:00:59.662
- Why wasn't this incident reported?
- Nothing to report.

01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:02.399
All the prisoners
were present and accounted for.

01:01:02.466 --> 01:01:05.402
- So you pretended nothing happened?
- Hey, Corvis fried.

01:01:05.469 --> 01:01:07.770
I don't see how
it could've been him.

01:01:07.838 --> 01:01:11.274
No, I wouldn't
expect you to.

01:01:11.341 --> 01:01:16.547
Be forewarned. Nature takes its toll.
Bon appetit.

01:01:25.022 --> 01:01:29.058
Okay, you lost him.
Now clear out.

01:01:39.202 --> 01:01:43.007
- They botched the execution.
- Yeah, you could say that.

01:01:43.073 --> 01:01:47.777
Christ! It was Corvis.
Tommy Leonard was right.

01:01:47.844 --> 01:01:49.880
Hey, babe?

01:01:53.116 --> 01:01:55.052
Fuckin' crow.

01:01:58.755 --> 01:02:01.191
Sign of the dead
come back to life.

01:02:01.257 --> 01:02:03.694
How about sign of
a big black bird?

01:02:03.761 --> 01:02:07.531
The dead can return
given sufficient motivation.

01:02:07.598 --> 01:02:09.533
And Corvis has that.

01:02:09.599 --> 01:02:14.972
I've studied this phenomenon before.
He's looking for something.

01:02:14.972 --> 01:02:17.675
Won't stop
till he finds it.

01:02:17.741 --> 01:02:23.448
Sometimes, the best way
to get rid of someone is...
to let them have what they want.

01:02:23.514 --> 01:02:26.218
The man with the scar.

01:02:28.285 --> 01:02:32.723
Give him the man with
the scar, then he'll lose his powers.

01:02:32.823 --> 01:02:36.293
The man with the scar...

01:02:36.393 --> 01:02:38.829
took everything
I ever cared about.

01:02:38.896 --> 01:02:42.834
Left me with nothing.

01:02:42.901 --> 01:02:45.736
So you're going
to kill him?

01:02:45.803 --> 01:02:48.240
I have to find him first.

01:02:50.342 --> 01:02:55.446
You know what Lauren and I
were fighting about that night?

01:02:55.512 --> 01:02:57.948
She had a secret.

01:02:58.015 --> 01:02:59.850
Wouldn't tell me.

01:03:02.453 --> 01:03:04.589
My father.

01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:08.092
All I knew was
she was pulling away.

01:03:08.192 --> 01:03:10.128
It made me crazy.

01:03:10.195 --> 01:03:14.298
I used to be
so proud of him.

01:03:14.298 --> 01:03:17.802
My big-deal daddy.

01:03:17.903 --> 01:03:22.741
And now...
he's just a crook.

01:03:22.807 --> 01:03:25.777
Worse even.

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:29.014
And the weird thing is...

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.917
I wish I could hate him,

01:03:31.983 --> 01:03:34.452
but I can't.

01:03:34.553 --> 01:03:36.988
He said he'd never hurt
either of us.

01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:40.458
And I know it's true.

01:03:43.628 --> 01:03:46.097
And I'm going back.

01:03:49.668 --> 01:03:51.836
It's what Lauren
would do.

01:03:51.903 --> 01:03:54.139
I wanna forget.

01:03:55.607 --> 01:03:58.243
Forget everything.

01:04:03.915 --> 01:04:05.885
Keep it.

01:04:05.985 --> 01:04:08.888
It connects you to Lauren.

01:04:11.157 --> 01:04:14.026
And it connects you to me.

01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:28.874
No matter what happens,

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:33.112
I'll make sure everyone knows
that you're innocent.

01:04:34.212 --> 01:04:36.349
That you loved her.

01:04:38.851 --> 01:04:41.854
If you need me,
you know where to find me.

01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:55.601
- You know it doesn't work this way.
- I'm out of this, John.

01:04:57.970 --> 01:05:00.940
Partner ships
don't end like that.

01:05:01.007 --> 01:05:03.176
Friendships don't.

01:05:03.242 --> 01:05:07.880
Our friendship...
ended when Lauren died.

01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:11.884
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan?

01:05:11.984 --> 01:05:15.955
- Because there's a ghost
threatening us.
- You mean Alex.

01:05:17.623 --> 01:05:19.559
I mean Lauren.

01:05:19.625 --> 01:05:24.597
Because you never accepted that
what happened to her was an accident.

01:05:24.697 --> 01:05:27.166
Your men
killed my daughter.

01:05:27.233 --> 01:05:32.139
- An accident, Nathan.
- She was 1 8 years old.

01:05:32.206 --> 01:05:37.644
There were four of them.
They stabbed her 53 times.

01:05:37.744 --> 01:05:42.281
Where's the accident, John?
Where's the fucking accident?

01:05:42.381 --> 01:05:47.019
I watched her grow up,
just like you.

01:05:47.086 --> 01:05:50.691
I know how her mind worked.

01:05:50.757 --> 01:05:53.961
She was snooping around
because she was worried about you,

01:05:54.027 --> 01:05:56.964
about what you'd
gotten yourself into.

01:05:57.030 --> 01:06:01.869
So stop blaming me...
and blame yourself.

01:06:01.935 --> 01:06:05.672
I do... every day.

01:06:05.739 --> 01:06:07.941
Erin knows,
doesn't she?

01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:12.179
Don't bother.
You never were a good liar.

01:06:15.616 --> 01:06:17.550
Look at this.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:22.022
Everything we've worked for.

01:06:24.124 --> 01:06:29.329
Now, you tell me.
What are we going to do?

01:06:40.107 --> 01:06:43.610
Dad? You home?

01:07:59.521 --> 01:08:03.992
D-E-R-T is owned
by Westwind Builders,

01:08:04.092 --> 01:08:06.027
Nathan Randall's company.

01:08:06.094 --> 01:08:11.533
But DERT, in turn, owns
a dozen other corporations.

01:08:11.599 --> 01:08:16.471
That's a big mess to wade through,
so I checked out Tommy Leonard.

01:08:16.471 --> 01:08:20.642
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich.
They don't matter.

01:08:20.707 --> 01:08:22.644
You understand?

01:08:23.812 --> 01:08:25.380
I want the king.

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:30.718
We're getting there because,
in his so-called construction job,

01:08:30.785 --> 01:08:34.488
Tommy makes a daily delivery
to a place called The Key Club.

01:08:34.555 --> 01:08:39.027
- The strip joint?
- I believe they call it
a connoisseur's club.

01:08:39.127 --> 01:08:42.162
Owned by DERT.

01:08:42.263 --> 01:08:45.100
Places like this,
they're about unreported cash,

01:08:45.166 --> 01:08:48.871
processing money from drugs,
prostitution.

01:08:48.938 --> 01:08:51.106
So I took a chance.
I called over there,

01:08:51.173 --> 01:08:54.243
asking for Roberts and Toomey,
the two other cops.

01:08:54.343 --> 01:08:59.046
Whoever answered said, "They're not
here. This is the front office."

01:09:02.718 --> 01:09:04.886
They killed my dad.

01:09:08.758 --> 01:09:11.193
I can't take it.

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:13.863
Erin?

01:09:13.929 --> 01:09:16.599
Erin? Who?

01:09:16.599 --> 01:09:19.402
I don't know.
I found him lying there.

01:09:19.468 --> 01:09:23.371
Where is it, this place?

01:09:23.438 --> 01:09:26.942
- I think we should get some support.
- What, call the police?

01:09:27.042 --> 01:09:30.212
What is this?
Where are you going?

01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:32.214
1 31 5 Berkeley Street.

01:10:02.745 --> 01:10:06.182
Hey, you have some I.D., pal?
Circus in town, or what?

01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:44.554
How old are you?

01:10:44.621 --> 01:10:47.891
You have one chance
to value your life.

01:10:47.958 --> 01:10:50.160
Take it.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.236
We'll be safe in my car.
Nobody will recognize it.

01:10:59.302 --> 01:11:01.938
We'll put yours in back.

01:11:02.005 --> 01:11:04.474
You followed me here.

01:11:04.574 --> 01:11:07.377
No.

01:11:07.444 --> 01:11:12.649
Erin, I put a bulletin out
on your car because...

01:11:12.716 --> 01:11:16.286
there's bad news, and I thought
you should hear it from me.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:21.024
Your father got involved
with some bad cops on my force.

01:11:21.091 --> 01:11:25.296
So I take responsibility.
He killed himself.

01:11:26.897 --> 01:11:28.832
How?

01:11:28.899 --> 01:11:32.269
How'd he kill himself?
With a gun.

01:11:32.336 --> 01:11:37.207
With a gun, right? When there wasn't
one anywhere near where you found him!

01:11:39.344 --> 01:11:41.312
- You killed him.
- Erin, don't.

01:11:41.412 --> 01:11:44.082
- Back the fuck off now!
- He left this.

01:11:44.148 --> 01:11:47.118
There's names, addresses.
There's a note to you.

01:11:47.185 --> 01:11:51.689
These people he got involved with,
they killed Lauren.
He couldn't bear it anymore.

01:11:51.789 --> 01:11:56.760
Oh, my God, he's right.
It's all here.

01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:58.996
The note.
Show it to me.

01:11:59.062 --> 01:12:01.532
Not you!
Show it to me.

01:12:02.934 --> 01:12:05.002
It's right here.
Look, under here.

01:12:05.103 --> 01:12:06.738
Look.

01:12:20.318 --> 01:12:22.253
You need help?

01:12:23.888 --> 01:12:26.824
Finish him.

01:13:26.218 --> 01:13:30.122
Lauren?
You were here?

01:13:39.598 --> 01:13:41.800
Hey. Hey, c'mon. Wake up. Wake up.

01:13:41.866 --> 01:13:45.771
Hey. Come on, Sampson,
wake up. Come on.

01:13:47.573 --> 01:13:52.278
You awake, Sampson?
You awake?

01:13:53.812 --> 01:13:57.416
Not anymore.

01:13:57.483 --> 01:14:00.686
Shit. That's Randall's daughter.
She saw us.

01:14:00.753 --> 01:14:02.655
Go, go, go!
Get her!

01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:27.079
Gentlemen.

01:14:50.604 --> 01:14:52.305
Cheers.

01:15:01.781 --> 01:15:04.251
Find him!

01:15:04.317 --> 01:15:06.853
Go.

01:16:00.508 --> 01:16:02.810
Toomey!

01:16:36.511 --> 01:16:41.482
Spark, gas.
Bad combination.

01:16:44.719 --> 01:16:47.722
And it's not this leak here that's
the least of your worries, ya know?

01:16:53.328 --> 01:16:57.832
You're him.
Jesus, you're Corvis!

01:16:57.932 --> 01:17:00.968
We fried your ass!
You're a dead man!

01:17:01.068 --> 01:17:05.840
- Good thing, in a situation like this.
- You're a fuckin' zombie.

01:17:05.907 --> 01:17:07.708
Son of a bitch.

01:17:07.775 --> 01:17:10.678
- The scar!
- There is no scar!

01:18:00.129 --> 01:18:02.064
It's over.

01:18:22.951 --> 01:18:24.921
I'm losing you.

01:18:27.256 --> 01:18:30.225
Come on, Alex.

01:18:30.293 --> 01:18:33.630
Lauren?

01:18:39.535 --> 01:18:42.638
What'd you do that for?
He's bleeding.

01:18:42.738 --> 01:18:45.240
I don't--
I don't bleed.

01:19:11.067 --> 01:19:13.603
Erin?

01:19:51.342 --> 01:19:53.309
The king.

01:20:41.425 --> 01:20:44.361
I hate that picture.

01:20:44.427 --> 01:20:46.664
Where is she?

01:20:46.731 --> 01:20:48.899
Can I get you something?

01:20:48.966 --> 01:20:51.502
Glass of water?
Transfusion?

01:20:51.602 --> 01:20:54.505
Last chance.

01:20:54.572 --> 01:20:56.507
Where's Erin?

01:20:56.574 --> 01:20:59.944
Or what? You'll bleed
all over my carpet?

01:21:00.010 --> 01:21:02.780
You know,

01:21:02.847 --> 01:21:06.384
crime was actually down
before you showed up.

01:21:06.484 --> 01:21:08.452
Or, uh,

01:21:08.519 --> 01:21:12.723
stuck around, or whatever the hell
you're doing here.

01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:15.326
What are you doing here?

01:21:15.359 --> 01:21:17.629
I'm looking for my friend.

01:21:17.696 --> 01:21:22.133
See, I heard you were looking
for some guy with a scar.

01:21:22.199 --> 01:21:24.935
How's that going?
Did you find him?

01:21:25.002 --> 01:21:28.939
Yes? No?

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:32.476
You're like the guest
who would not leave.

01:21:32.576 --> 01:21:36.948
And, judging by your condition,
maybe you've overstayed your welcome.

01:21:37.015 --> 01:21:40.918
It's not a criticism,
it's just an observation.

01:21:40.985 --> 01:21:44.356
Oh.

01:21:44.423 --> 01:21:48.392
I don't think you're gonna use it.
That's Lauren's knife.

01:21:50.896 --> 01:21:55.467
You come in here so full of righteous
indignation. What have you got to be...

01:21:55.567 --> 01:21:57.736
so righteous about,
huh?

01:21:57.803 --> 01:22:00.605
How many innocent people
did you leave dead back there?

01:22:00.672 --> 01:22:02.606
I had no choice.
You sent them.

01:22:02.673 --> 01:22:07.479
Bullshit! You're a killer,
that's all you are.

01:22:07.546 --> 01:22:11.148
Just a clown with a bird
and a rising death toll.

01:22:11.249 --> 01:22:13.251
You think the world
did you wrong? Huh?

01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:15.754
You did the world wrong.

01:22:15.754 --> 01:22:19.691
You and Lauren had a fight,
and you couldn't let it go.

01:22:27.733 --> 01:22:31.470
- What is your problem?

01:22:31.536 --> 01:22:34.706
- Why won't you tell me?
- I can't tell you!

01:22:34.773 --> 01:22:37.743
I just--
I just can't. I--

01:22:37.843 --> 01:22:40.947
- Come back here! Come here!
- No! Stop!

01:22:42.547 --> 01:22:46.118
It was bad enough her dad
rejected you, but when she did...

01:22:46.219 --> 01:22:49.389
-you lost it.
- You're wrong.

01:22:49.455 --> 01:22:53.158
Yeah? Well, I see doubt
oozing out all over you.

01:22:53.225 --> 01:22:55.694
Where do people go
who kill their girlfriends?

01:22:55.794 --> 01:22:58.497
- Screwed-up kid.
-

01:22:58.563 --> 01:23:01.900
He stabbed her 53 times.
Where will he end up?

01:23:07.139 --> 01:23:10.843
Take a look, you sick fuck!
That's who you are.

01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:13.579
Are you looking?

01:23:13.646 --> 01:23:16.649
Every loser name anybody
ever called you is true.

01:23:16.683 --> 01:23:19.085
- Are you looking?

01:23:23.789 --> 01:23:26.158
I never meant to hurt her.

01:23:26.224 --> 01:23:28.294
You see it?

01:23:28.394 --> 01:23:34.132
Alexander Frederick Corvis,
do you have any last words?

01:23:34.199 --> 01:23:36.402
I loved Lauren.

01:23:37.770 --> 01:23:40.206
I never meant
to hurt her.

01:23:40.273 --> 01:23:42.809
Did you see it?

01:23:44.010 --> 01:23:45.945
Did you see it?

01:23:47.513 --> 01:23:51.517
Yeah, I think
you fuckin' saw it.

01:23:56.689 --> 01:24:02.095
Lucky, huh? I guess
he found the arm you planted.

01:24:02.161 --> 01:24:05.798
A fake picture's worth
a thousand words, huh?

01:24:05.865 --> 01:24:08.134
Just don't believe
everything you see.

01:24:08.201 --> 01:24:10.203
Doubt is a motherfucker.

01:24:10.303 --> 01:24:13.539
Give me a hand
with this sack of shit.

01:24:15.209 --> 01:24:17.410
Oh, he's cute!

01:24:17.477 --> 01:24:19.879
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Was cute.

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:28.554
All but the face.

01:24:28.622 --> 01:24:31.325
Well, makeup
can work for you...

01:24:31.392 --> 01:24:33.826
or against you,
right?

01:24:33.893 --> 01:24:36.229
All done.

01:24:36.296 --> 01:24:38.231
Very nice.

01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:45.739
- You're such a good listener.
-  Clear the table.

01:24:51.645 --> 01:24:54.947
I've read about this,
but I never thought I'd see it.

01:24:55.014 --> 01:24:59.453
So, was he alive
or dead?

01:24:59.553 --> 01:25:02.456
I've seen birds stuffed
and mounted so lifelike...

01:25:02.523 --> 01:25:04.491
you'd swear
you saw them breathing.

01:25:04.558 --> 01:25:08.429
Yeah, maybe we've got a case
of that here. Get me my kit.

01:25:12.666 --> 01:25:16.903
The two of you are majorly demented.
You know that?

01:25:16.903 --> 01:25:21.842
He should've gone home when he found the
scar we planted. He came to save her.

01:25:21.942 --> 01:25:25.512
Caring for the living.
Not part of his job description.

01:25:31.585 --> 01:25:34.655
- Fifty-three?
- In all the excitement,
I guess I lost count.

01:25:37.791 --> 01:25:42.129
Think I'll mount him
with his head up his ass.

01:25:49.136 --> 01:25:51.205
- Grab it!

01:26:10.824 --> 01:26:12.893
And it connects you to me.

01:26:14.963 --> 01:26:17.933
No matter what happens,

01:26:18.032 --> 01:26:21.702
I'll make sure
everyone knows...

01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:23.704
that you're innocent.

01:26:26.573 --> 01:26:30.679
I promise.

01:26:47.329 --> 01:26:51.466
Everything you ever showed me,
all lies.

01:26:53.802 --> 01:26:57.572
- I'll kill her.
- No!

01:26:57.639 --> 01:26:59.741
Oh, I'd love to hurt ya!

01:27:19.028 --> 01:27:21.597
- Got you!

01:27:23.966 --> 01:27:26.402
That bird!
Kill it!

01:28:18.354 --> 01:28:20.290
You brought him back.

01:28:20.356 --> 01:28:23.626
Good.
He owes you.

01:28:35.171 --> 01:28:37.139
Where did they go?

01:30:45.269 --> 01:30:48.840
- I know you too well. You won't do it.
- You don't know me at all.

01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:51.409
Aah! God!

01:30:54.179 --> 01:30:58.450
There's only one in the chamber.
That's all you get.

01:31:00.618 --> 01:31:03.188
Holy mother of God!

01:31:09.427 --> 01:31:11.396
The devil himself.

01:31:33.918 --> 01:31:36.521
What the fuck?

01:32:04.650 --> 01:32:07.820
The jolt,

01:32:07.887 --> 01:32:12.058
eight amps
at 2,000 to 3,000 volts.

01:32:12.124 --> 01:32:15.861
It lasts a few seconds.

01:32:15.861 --> 01:32:19.631
The current surges
and is turned off.

01:32:19.697 --> 01:32:22.935
Then they check to see
if the heart is still beating.

01:32:23.002 --> 01:32:24.937
If it is... ba-boom!

01:32:25.003 --> 01:32:28.974
Another jolt is applied.

01:32:31.744 --> 01:32:33.946
Experts say
unconsciousness...

01:32:34.013 --> 01:32:38.918
occurs before pain
has time to register.

01:32:38.984 --> 01:32:41.320
They agree
that electrocution...

01:32:41.387 --> 01:32:44.391
does not hurt.

01:32:44.490 --> 01:32:46.960
But it does.

01:32:47.060 --> 01:32:51.397
Unimaginably...
believe me.

01:32:54.133 --> 01:32:58.138
I... don't expect a call
from the governor.

01:32:59.905 --> 01:33:03.443
Any last words...
Captain?

01:33:06.179 --> 01:33:08.582
Yeah.
Fuck you!

01:33:14.554 --> 01:33:16.422
Was that it?

01:33:17.857 --> 01:33:20.693
I'm not dying for your goddamn
illusions! You got that?

01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:26.198
You think you and your girl friend
had some rosy future taken
from you? Bullshit!

01:33:26.298 --> 01:33:29.535
She was already bored. Why do
you think she was lookin' around?

01:33:29.602 --> 01:33:32.171
You're nothing, Corvis.
Less than nothing!

01:33:34.007 --> 01:33:36.576
You can't do this to me,
you little fucks!

01:33:37.843 --> 01:33:40.881
You hear me?
You understand?

01:33:40.981 --> 01:33:43.215
I'll be back!

01:33:43.282 --> 01:33:47.354
Just like you! A big,
fucking, shit-spewing bird!

01:33:47.454 --> 01:33:50.023
And guess which little bitch
I'm taking out first!

01:33:50.123 --> 01:33:53.026
You are so dead.

01:34:43.077 --> 01:34:45.011
Erin?

01:34:47.414 --> 01:34:51.052
I'll always be with you,
and so will Lauren.

01:34:51.152 --> 01:34:54.255
Alex, look.

01:35:21.516 --> 01:35:26.788
In that moment, when
Alex went, I knew I was making a choice.

01:35:26.854 --> 01:35:29.791
To be alive in the world.

01:35:29.857 --> 01:35:32.527
I'm thinking of them...

01:35:32.593 --> 01:35:37.332
hoping that sometimes
they're thinking of me.
