09:57.763 --> 10:00.224
Did he really walk on water?

10:00.600 --> 10:03.227
It happened far away.
It's difficult to know.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.816
We are here now, aren't we?

10:09.942 --> 10:12.153
And there are problems
right in front of us.

10:14.322 --> 10:18.200
The other refugees, the ones you led...
and the rest of Palestine...

10:20.286 --> 10:24.290
I would ask you
to read this statement in public.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.293
You are a hero, Jibril...

10:34.675 --> 10:37.428
and your voice can be
powerful and influential.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.391
You want me to say all this?

10:43.643 --> 10:45.645
I urge you to look it over.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.401
We believe that we have
the right of sovereignty...

10:53.486 --> 10:56.322
and the right to be free of occupation.

10:56.739 --> 11:02.912
This is something you must understand...

11:03.663 --> 11:06.499
after living in Yarmouk your whole life.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.503
We need to be recognized, as a nation.

11:22.807 --> 11:23.766
What's wrong?

11:25.601 --> 11:26.727
Do you not agree?

11:29.522 --> 11:31.023
I don't know how to read.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.894
There's only one book.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.618
It's time to put away childish things.

21:50.350 --> 21:51.810
Wonder of Wonders.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.911
And you admit to this... freely?

27:03.663 --> 27:04.664
Yes.

27:09.377 --> 27:10.295
Why?

27:10.879 --> 27:11.796
Why do it?

27:11.880 --> 27:13.340
Why would you let him go?

27:15.342 --> 27:16.801
Because he is the Messiah.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.160
I want to talk to Ellie.

27:43.161 --> 27:45.580
<i>Where the hell have you been?</i>

27:45.747 --> 27:46.873
It doesn't matter.

27:47.540 --> 27:48.708
Away. Working.

27:49.709 --> 27:50.585
Work?

27:51.044 --> 27:52.253
That's not what I heard.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.506
<i>It doesn't matter what you heard.</i>

27:55.131 --> 27:56.925
So you didn't get yourself suspended?

27:59.427 --> 28:02.597
I didn't call to fight with you.
I just want to talk to my daughter.

28:16.611 --> 28:17.779
-How's my girl?
-<i>Daddy!</i>

28:18.780 --> 28:20.782
So are you learning
lots of things in school?

28:21.866 --> 28:24.035
<i>I haven't been going.</i>

28:24.119 --> 28:25.245
Why not?

28:25.328 --> 28:28.331
We're doing emergency drills.

28:28.915 --> 28:30.458
<i>You are?</i>

28:31.376 --> 28:35.547
But Ido taught me how to draw a cat.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.549
"Ido"?

28:39.843 --> 28:41.094
That's what you call him?

28:41.803 --> 28:43.805
<i>Yes... It's what he likes.</i>

28:48.893 --> 28:51.896
<i>I bet you draw the best cats.</i>

28:53.940 --> 28:55.525
<i>You'll have to show me.</i>

28:55.942 --> 28:58.278
<i>Can you come over now?</i>

28:59.112 --> 29:01.197
<i>I can't today. I'm sorry.</i>

29:03.450 --> 29:06.494
When are you coming home?

29:07.829 --> 29:10.498
<i>I'll be back home...</i>

29:11.166 --> 29:14.169
<i>just as soon as I finish</i>
<i>a couple of things.</i>

29:14.252 --> 29:15.795
You promise?

29:23.636 --> 29:25.346
I love you, my princess.

29:25.930 --> 29:28.725
I love you too, Daddy.

29:58.379 --> 30:01.966
Yeah... I got a lock on his phone.

32:41.250 --> 32:42.377
Who are you?

32:45.171 --> 32:46.839
I will be your wife.
