01:46.633 --> 01:49.261
- Yo, fellas, what's up?
- Same old, same old.

01:49.335 --> 01:52.030
I got eight balls, I got
redi-rocks, I got jumbos.

01:52.104 --> 01:55.232
- Shit, I even got starter kits.
- Jumbos. Two 20s.

01:55.307 --> 01:57.104
Two 20s be 40.

01:57.776 --> 01:59.368
Can you break this?

02:03.682 --> 02:05.912
I ain't no cash machine.

02:07.219 --> 02:08.776
You laughing at me?

02:11.088 --> 02:13.079
Naw, brother, I'm just sayin'...

02:13.157 --> 02:14.715
You laugh at this?

02:14.792 --> 02:17.317
Yo, wait. Wait!

02:22.633 --> 02:24.123
Get the shit.

02:27.038 --> 02:28.596
Get the roll.

02:29.340 --> 02:31.330
Motherfucker's so dead.

02:32.309 --> 02:33.799
Dead all over.

02:33.877 --> 02:35.367
Oh, yeah?

02:40.483 --> 02:42.348
You dead too.

03:08.377 --> 03:09.969
I tell ya, Grandpa...

03:10.044 --> 03:13.343
this lot was full of used
cars this afternoon.

03:25.326 --> 03:29.194
Crime scenes. Detective
Pavletz. How ya doin', Sarge?

03:29.264 --> 03:30.890
Hold on.

03:38.739 --> 03:40.297
Okay.

03:41.942 --> 03:43.705
Black male.

03:44.711 --> 03:46.303
DOA.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.570
In car.

03:50.650 --> 03:52.311
Intersection.

03:53.552 --> 03:55.042
Hubbard...

03:55.821 --> 03:57.618
and Leavitt.

04:00.059 --> 04:03.620
Apparent gunshot victim.

04:06.465 --> 04:08.956
What's apparent, Sarge?

04:12.003 --> 04:13.493
Huge...

04:14.406 --> 04:17.101
fuckin' bullet holes...

04:18.442 --> 04:20.103
in head...

04:21.012 --> 04:22.809
and chest.

04:25.317 --> 04:27.615
Good enough. All right.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.592
Yo, Mad Dog, you're up.

04:47.271 --> 04:49.330
Ass end of the south side, right?

04:49.406 --> 04:52.602
No, you got a male dead man in
the 14th district. You'll find it.

04:52.675 --> 04:54.643
Indoors or outdoors?

04:54.711 --> 04:56.440
In a car.

04:58.648 --> 05:01.640
- Yo, Mike, you're up.
- Five more minutes, Ma.

05:16.865 --> 05:19.925
Hey, Mad Dog, you know
what I want for Christmas?

05:20.802 --> 05:22.895
Sixteen vestal virgins.

05:25.674 --> 05:27.266
Fix your collar.

05:31.479 --> 05:33.970
That head-in-the-garbage-can
job last night?

05:34.048 --> 05:36.983
I told the coroner, "Just
bring a bowling ball bag."

05:37.852 --> 05:41.049
Mad Dog, I tell you this too, 'cause
your partner here is brain dead.

05:41.122 --> 05:43.113
Pick me up some Twinkies.

05:43.190 --> 05:45.988
There should be a little mini-mart open
a couple of blocks from the scene.

05:46.060 --> 05:48.324
Twinkies? It's 2:00 in the
morning, you fat fuck.

05:48.396 --> 05:51.193
Twinkies. And get a banana
for your monkey here.

05:51.264 --> 05:52.822
A green one.

06:21.493 --> 06:23.188
Hey, Mad Dog.

06:35.139 --> 06:37.334
Just your basic dead shit skin.

06:37.408 --> 06:39.933
Nobody's been in the car, right?
Everything's nice and cherry?

06:40.011 --> 06:41.740
Hey, absolutely.

06:42.413 --> 06:44.381
Yo!

06:44.449 --> 06:45.916
Brother...

06:46.417 --> 06:48.078
you fucked up.

06:48.719 --> 06:52.313
The doer might be in the crowd. Think
you can get me a group portrait?

06:53.857 --> 06:56.451
Yeah. Let's do the street.

07:09.673 --> 07:11.663
From the direction of the
blood on the window...

07:11.740 --> 07:13.867
I'd say your victim
got whacked here...

07:13.943 --> 07:16.969
and your shooter was sitting in
the front passenger seat there.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.012
You got a lot of blood
in the doorwell...

07:20.082 --> 07:22.346
so the door had to
be open at the time.

07:22.418 --> 07:24.750
Maybe he slipped in
for a quick sale...

07:24.820 --> 07:28.551
and the deal went sour or it
was rip-off time and ba-boom.

07:29.525 --> 07:31.651
You see that scorch mark
over the temple there?

07:31.726 --> 07:32.784
Yeah.

07:32.861 --> 07:35.455
The muzzle couldn't have been
more than two, three inches away.

07:35.530 --> 07:39.398
But you see this? Your blow-back
shot a good two feet.

07:41.236 --> 07:43.534
So your shooter's arm's gotta
be covered with blood.

07:43.605 --> 07:45.664
I can tell you more
when we pull him out.

07:45.740 --> 07:48.504
- This blow-back too?
- Where?

07:48.576 --> 07:50.566
Over there on the window.

07:50.644 --> 07:53.841
No, there's no blood on the headrest.
Blow-back don't leap over things.

07:53.914 --> 07:55.905
That's somebody else.

07:58.585 --> 08:00.416
We got a crowbar somewheres?

08:03.090 --> 08:05.752
Hey, it's a doubleheader.

08:17.436 --> 08:19.267
I'll be right back.

08:19.338 --> 08:22.830
You're killing him, Mad Dog.
Get him some melba toast.

08:23.509 --> 08:25.841
Mike, do me a favor.
My name's Wayne.

08:34.852 --> 08:37.014
That old black magic
has me in its spell

08:37.087 --> 08:39.488
That old black magic
that you weave so well

08:39.558 --> 08:42.186
Those icy fingers up
and down my spine

08:42.260 --> 08:45.627
That same old witchcraft
when your eyes meet mine

08:49.034 --> 08:52.230
- You got any Twinkies?
- No.

08:56.307 --> 08:57.968
How about melba toast?

08:58.709 --> 09:00.700
What the hell's melba toast, right?

09:09.553 --> 09:11.042
What's that?

09:11.554 --> 09:13.044
A dollar.

09:13.122 --> 09:15.147
A dollar? What is
this, a hotel lobby?

09:16.159 --> 09:17.649
Fifty cents.

09:28.037 --> 09:29.834
Jesus, don't shoot him. Please.

09:33.675 --> 09:36.075
Let me tell you, there's a crime
scene right down the block.

09:36.144 --> 09:37.736
You shoot, they'll hear.

09:37.813 --> 09:41.112
Please, you want the money?
Just take it. Go out the back.

09:41.183 --> 09:42.878
Did you take it yet?

09:42.951 --> 09:44.942
- Jesus Christ.
- Shut up.

09:45.988 --> 09:47.421
You want the money?

09:54.428 --> 09:55.759
You smoke?

09:56.163 --> 09:58.256
What do you smoke?

09:58.332 --> 09:59.993
Take some cartons here.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.297
- Would you like some candy?
- Do you like candy?

10:02.370 --> 10:04.964
Why don't you give him a fucking
back rub while you're at it?

10:05.039 --> 10:06.700
I said shut up!

10:06.774 --> 10:08.935
Please, go out the back.
You gotta go quiet.

10:09.010 --> 10:10.704
You can make it. You
gotta go now, though.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.142
Call him a cab.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.206
Get the fuck up.

10:15.582 --> 10:16.810
Please.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.452
Do you like Rice-A-Roni? How
about a nice Diet Sprite?

10:21.521 --> 10:23.580
They'll hear it. They're
right down the block.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.049
You fucker!

10:33.699 --> 10:34.961
You all right?

10:35.467 --> 10:36.957
Fuck off.

10:37.036 --> 10:39.470
Call 911. Say "police
officer needs assistance."

10:40.139 --> 10:41.663
You're a cop?

10:41.740 --> 10:44.004
Just do it. Tell 'em
where your store is.

10:44.076 --> 10:46.670
This ain't my store.
It's his store.

10:48.514 --> 10:50.208
Just do it.

11:25.782 --> 11:29.616
Down and down I go
round and round I go

11:29.686 --> 11:33.519
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in

11:33.589 --> 11:38.288
That old black magic called love

11:43.532 --> 11:45.022
Jesus.

11:46.869 --> 11:48.837
- You okay?
- Yeah.

12:11.925 --> 12:13.483
What's up?

12:27.107 --> 12:28.597
Thanks, Wayne.

12:30.276 --> 12:32.870
Do you want a cup of
coffee or something?

12:34.647 --> 12:36.410
Naw, I'll go through the roof.

12:37.817 --> 12:40.615
How about a shot of something?
It'll help you sleep.

12:44.023 --> 12:45.581
I better just flop.

12:48.027 --> 12:49.551
Well, sweet dreams.

12:50.629 --> 12:52.529
Yeah, thanks. You too.

13:02.307 --> 13:05.299
Old black magic has me in its spell

13:05.377 --> 13:09.507
Old black magic that
you weave so well

13:09.581 --> 13:12.845
Those icy fingers up
and down my spine

13:12.917 --> 13:16.876
The same old witchcraft
when your eyes meet mine

13:55.356 --> 13:58.450
That's the first time I've
pulled out my gun in 15 years.

14:00.161 --> 14:02.459
I pissed on myself.

14:02.530 --> 14:04.122
You know why?

14:04.198 --> 14:06.428
Because you're a sensitive,
intelligent individual

14:08.703 --> 14:10.363
You ever piss on yourself?

14:11.405 --> 14:14.306
I would've walked in there and drilled
the red-eyed little bastard...

14:14.374 --> 14:16.365
but that's just the way I am.

14:16.443 --> 14:18.570
But if I ever had an
intelligent thought...

14:18.645 --> 14:20.237
it would die of loneliness.

14:20.314 --> 14:22.942
It all evens out. You
know what I mean?

14:23.016 --> 14:24.847
Let me tell you something.

14:24.918 --> 14:28.445
Next time that happens,
you're that scared...

14:28.522 --> 14:30.614
the best thing is sex.

14:32.658 --> 14:35.354
You're all adrenalized.
You'll go off like a rocket.

14:35.428 --> 14:37.328
Just give me a break, will you?

14:37.396 --> 14:40.024
If I was you last night,
I would have been on the horn...

14:40.099 --> 14:43.500
with every broad I knew who
wasn't related to me by blood.

14:43.569 --> 14:45.764
Wayne, on me.

14:47.139 --> 14:48.868
Just a pinch in here.

14:49.709 --> 14:51.198
Thanks, Tom.

14:51.276 --> 14:52.743
They get the guy?

14:54.012 --> 14:56.882
They know who he is. He ain't
going nowhere. They never do.

14:56.982 --> 14:59.302
They know who he is. He ain't
going nowhere. They never do.

15:14.031 --> 15:17.523
Now here's a guy with one
abiding principle in his life.

15:19.236 --> 15:21.033
To always refuse to testify...

15:21.105 --> 15:23.869
on the grounds that it may
tend to incriminate him.

15:23.941 --> 15:24.965
Jesus.

15:27.478 --> 15:28.911
Chivas and milk.

15:33.583 --> 15:35.881
Put that on my tab, Tommy.

15:39.389 --> 15:41.414
You ready? Let's go.

15:41.491 --> 15:43.459
No, I'm off tonight.

15:43.526 --> 15:44.857
You got somethin' on?

15:45.862 --> 15:48.524
Naw, I just... I'll play it by ear.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.965
That was balls up what
you did last night.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.558
Don't kid yourself.

15:57.906 --> 16:00.306
Thanks, Tom. I'll call you later.

16:30.437 --> 16:31.927
Are you Wayne?

16:32.639 --> 16:34.129
Who are you?

16:34.541 --> 16:36.168
Harold.

16:36.242 --> 16:39.109
I was over to your apartment.
You weren't there.

16:39.679 --> 16:41.271
I work for my boss...

16:41.347 --> 16:45.181
and he asked me to find you to
invite you to this thing tonight.

16:45.251 --> 16:46.843
It's free with this.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.649
The Comic-Cazie Club.

16:49.289 --> 16:51.347
You also get a free drink.

16:54.626 --> 16:56.116
Who's your boss?

16:56.895 --> 16:58.863
He said not to say...

16:58.931 --> 17:02.332
but that you know him, and he'd
really like to talk to you.

17:03.635 --> 17:05.796
Don't worry, it's not a bad thing.

17:05.871 --> 17:07.429
It's a good thing.

17:07.873 --> 17:09.534
Who is he, Harold?

17:09.608 --> 17:12.701
It don't start till
about 10:00, 10:30...

17:12.777 --> 17:15.268
but I can come by later and
pick you up if you want.

17:18.449 --> 17:20.109
No, thanks. I'll pass.

17:26.089 --> 17:28.752
That other cop? Your friend?

17:29.894 --> 17:31.690
He's very sarcastic.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.707
Hold it.

17:55.451 --> 17:56.577
Don't move.

17:58.154 --> 18:00.247
Don't even breathe.

18:12.801 --> 18:14.701
Call it in, Fredo.

18:16.971 --> 18:18.768
Now, Fredo.

18:39.693 --> 18:41.285
Nice place, huh?

18:43.096 --> 18:46.031
Give him a coffee and cognac.

18:46.099 --> 18:47.623
Comin' up.

18:47.701 --> 18:49.362
Show her your comp.

18:56.576 --> 18:58.567
- Decaf, please.
- Right.

19:01.113 --> 19:02.808
Who's your boss?

19:05.885 --> 19:07.375
That's decaf, right?

19:08.621 --> 19:10.247
I'm sorry.

19:12.390 --> 19:14.620
Can't you use a clean
napkin or something?

19:18.663 --> 19:20.563
- Okay?
- No problem.

19:26.170 --> 19:27.831
Take it with you.

19:32.542 --> 19:34.032
You're wastin' time.

19:34.110 --> 19:36.544
You notice that all nightclub
singers do this when they come out?

19:36.612 --> 19:38.273
They'll give you this move, right?

19:38.347 --> 19:40.372
Everything's gonna be okay

19:40.450 --> 19:42.611
As soon as I get my neck fixed

19:42.685 --> 19:45.153
Now, from Melrose Park...

19:45.221 --> 19:47.485
the land of razor-cut hair...

19:47.557 --> 19:51.219
I.D. Bracelets, and
velour car interiors.

19:51.293 --> 19:54.262
The comedy stylings of Frank Milo,
ladies and gentlemen. Dig it.

19:56.398 --> 19:58.423
Yo, Frankie!

20:10.377 --> 20:13.175
Cosa nostra.

20:14.448 --> 20:16.177
Our thing.

20:22.490 --> 20:24.424
Our thing, my ass.

20:25.092 --> 20:27.424
Cosa nostra is Italian...

20:27.495 --> 20:29.429
for "cheap bastards."

20:33.566 --> 20:36.763
The only thing cheaper
than a hood is a cop.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.861
Cops. Forget about it.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.141
They squeeze the nickel
till the buffalo shits.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.509
Cosa nostra babies.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.241
Other babies, they're born...

20:49.315 --> 20:52.283
they cry, they go, "Waaaa-waaaa."

20:53.385 --> 20:56.752
Our kids, they cry, they go...

20:58.357 --> 20:59.654
"Wha?"

21:04.997 --> 21:06.589
My friend Angie.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.992
Angie's father was on his deathbed.

21:12.103 --> 21:14.264
He calls his sons
to him and says...

21:14.338 --> 21:17.432
"Put a hundred in my
coffin. Each of you."

21:17.508 --> 21:21.000
In case, you know, you
can take it with you.

21:24.348 --> 21:27.078
The guy dies.

21:28.619 --> 21:30.950
Angie's two brothers...

21:31.021 --> 21:33.148
put in their yardage.

21:33.223 --> 21:34.986
Angie...

21:35.058 --> 21:38.425
drops in a check for 300
and takes out the cash.

21:39.696 --> 21:41.391
That fuckin' Angie.

21:44.801 --> 21:46.860
When did Angie's father die?

21:55.711 --> 21:57.406
There he is.

22:01.383 --> 22:03.476
Hey, they takin'
care of you tonight?

22:03.552 --> 22:05.144
Yeah, thanks.

22:05.854 --> 22:07.583
Don't let 'em schlong you on tips.

22:14.529 --> 22:16.292
I told my therapist about you...

22:16.364 --> 22:18.127
about what happened...

22:18.600 --> 22:21.467
and she said that I was a
real suicidal asshole...

22:24.973 --> 22:27.339
and that, in fact, I was
probably very scared...

22:27.408 --> 22:31.207
and was just resorting to macho
bullshit like I'm programmed to.

22:31.712 --> 22:34.237
And that what you did...

22:34.314 --> 22:37.647
was very brave and compassionate...

22:38.185 --> 22:41.746
and that I should both apologize
to you and thank you.

22:42.823 --> 22:44.154
Hey, Frank...

22:44.224 --> 22:45.748
isn't that Phil Donahue?

22:50.529 --> 22:52.622
Put the magazine down
before you hurt yourself.

22:52.698 --> 22:54.097
Okay, Harold?

22:55.868 --> 22:57.460
So, are you married?

22:58.304 --> 22:59.328
No.

22:59.405 --> 23:02.101
Not personally, no.

23:02.875 --> 23:04.365
Me neither.

23:07.546 --> 23:09.309
Are you really connected?

23:09.382 --> 23:12.680
I know guys. Guys know me.

23:12.751 --> 23:16.585
I put money on the street, people know
to pay me back on time as a rule.

23:16.655 --> 23:18.953
They call me "Frank
The Money Store."

23:19.024 --> 23:20.491
You hear of me?

23:21.760 --> 23:23.159
No.

23:23.828 --> 23:25.819
I suppose that's good.

23:25.897 --> 23:29.389
Although my therapist says I crave
recognition more than accomplishment.

23:30.567 --> 23:32.694
Maybe that's why I do stand-up.

23:33.304 --> 23:35.397
What the hell? I own the club.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.540
What do you think of my act?

23:42.680 --> 23:46.207
I heard two Buddy Hackett jokes, a Pat
Cooper, and a half a Lenny Bruce.

23:47.051 --> 23:48.916
Another thing, you know...

23:48.986 --> 23:51.351
I was watching you and it's
all shooting out at people.

23:51.421 --> 23:54.822
Sometimes you should aim in.
Make a joke at your own expense.

23:54.891 --> 23:58.088
Otherwise it looks, kind of like...

23:58.161 --> 24:00.527
It comes off kind of hostile,
you know what I mean?

24:01.364 --> 24:04.128
That's Phil fuckin' Donahue.

24:11.006 --> 24:13.634
All right, let the body heat
coming up through your hand...

24:13.709 --> 24:15.438
warm up the cognac.

24:15.510 --> 24:17.307
Give it a little swirl.

24:18.880 --> 24:20.370
Take a little sniff.

24:22.851 --> 24:24.648
Nice, right?

24:24.720 --> 24:27.245
Okay, take a sip, but hold it.

24:27.322 --> 24:28.914
Don't gulp it.

24:28.990 --> 24:32.425
Just let it leak back
down your throat.

24:33.194 --> 24:35.992
- I know how to drink cognac.
- Okay.

24:36.063 --> 24:38.623
Hello. Not now.

24:39.734 --> 24:41.258
Cheers.

24:51.311 --> 24:52.710
My wife?

24:52.779 --> 24:56.772
She thinks fucking and cooking
are two cities in China.

24:56.850 --> 24:59.011
I thought you said
you weren't married.

25:00.820 --> 25:02.151
Where'd you hear that?

25:03.390 --> 25:05.051
I just made that up.

25:05.625 --> 25:08.822
- Bullshit.
- Go ahead. Use it.

25:14.833 --> 25:16.960
Don't ever, ever fuck with me.

25:17.669 --> 25:19.364
Don't ever lie to me...

25:19.438 --> 25:23.169
disrespect me, underestimate me.

25:23.242 --> 25:26.473
If you do, your life
becomes a raging sea.

25:27.646 --> 25:31.081
But come to me like a man...

25:31.149 --> 25:35.176
come to me eyes open,
head up, hand out...

25:35.586 --> 25:39.682
then I become more than a
friend, more than a shoulder.

25:39.757 --> 25:42.920
I become the expediter
of your dreams.

25:45.463 --> 25:47.124
That's beautiful.

25:52.702 --> 25:55.136
Get the hell in the car, Wayne.

25:55.205 --> 25:56.866
What if it rains?

26:00.777 --> 26:03.302
I wish I was a handsome man.

26:03.380 --> 26:04.540
What?

26:05.615 --> 26:09.107
I wish I was brave. I wish I was...

26:09.186 --> 26:10.948
I wish I had real...

26:11.720 --> 26:13.312
real guts.

26:14.824 --> 26:18.282
You wish you were a
brave, handsome man?

26:18.360 --> 26:20.624
No offense, but that
sounds a little immature.

26:21.664 --> 26:24.224
Shit, I wish a lot
of things, but I...

26:27.169 --> 26:30.831
You don't know. Nobody...
You don't know.

26:31.339 --> 26:33.671
You don't always talk to other
guys like this, do you?

26:34.175 --> 26:35.802
What'd I say?

26:36.444 --> 26:38.708
- Nothin'.
- What'd I say?

26:39.113 --> 26:41.013
Nothin'.

26:48.756 --> 26:50.814
You're really good, man.

27:00.834 --> 27:03.394
You know, I wish I was
a real photographer.

27:03.470 --> 27:05.233
Not just like a...

27:05.305 --> 27:07.136
I don't mean police
work or weddings.

27:07.207 --> 27:09.038
- I mean...
- You mean like an artist.

27:11.110 --> 27:13.374
You know, I get this
feeling me and you...

27:13.446 --> 27:15.914
We both wanna be someplace
else. You know what I mean?

27:17.116 --> 27:18.413
Not me.

27:20.219 --> 27:22.983
Okay. Not you.

27:24.624 --> 27:27.024
This guy looks like William Holden.

27:33.598 --> 27:36.465
One time I went down to see this
group show with photographers...

27:36.535 --> 27:38.526
and I hit it off with
this lady in the show.

27:38.603 --> 27:41.731
I met all her friends
in the lofts and all.

27:41.806 --> 27:43.467
Then I showed her my stuff...

27:43.542 --> 27:46.067
and this guy says to me...

27:46.144 --> 27:48.135
"What do you think about
being an artist?"

27:48.213 --> 27:51.807
I said, "Yeah, sure,
but the only thing is...

27:51.882 --> 27:55.318
there's no pension, no
security, no major medical."

27:58.656 --> 28:00.351
Nobody laughed.

28:00.424 --> 28:02.392
But as soon as I said that,
know what I thought?

28:02.459 --> 28:03.892
I'm just a cop.

28:03.961 --> 28:07.124
I'm like a real civil servant.
That's the way I think.

28:07.197 --> 28:09.062
I think like a civil servant.

28:09.133 --> 28:12.067
But these people...
They're artists.

28:12.135 --> 28:14.204
They're special. They take chances.

28:14.604 --> 28:17.596
Chances. You're a
fuckin' policeman.

28:17.674 --> 28:19.767
What kind of chances you
think they're takin'?

28:19.842 --> 28:21.833
That the goddamn sushi
might be tainted?

28:22.212 --> 28:24.203
Naw, look, it's different.

28:26.616 --> 28:30.244
Either you understand what
I'm saying, or you don't.

28:30.319 --> 28:33.482
Hey, are you mad at me?
I'm on your side.

28:33.555 --> 28:35.580
No, look. Even she said it.

28:36.758 --> 28:40.353
My stuff comes out of the job.
The job is the truth of it.

28:40.929 --> 28:42.453
The all of it.

28:42.531 --> 28:44.396
I don't create stuff.

28:44.466 --> 28:46.195
I find stuff.

28:48.237 --> 28:51.364
Anyway, she was
pretty nice about it.

28:52.440 --> 28:55.432
A nice person. I liked her.

28:56.177 --> 28:57.644
She was nice.

28:57.712 --> 28:59.577
She sounds like a bitch.

28:59.647 --> 29:00.773
Hey, Frank.

29:00.848 --> 29:02.338
Bobby Gee.

29:02.984 --> 29:04.918
Yeah, so I noticed.

29:05.586 --> 29:07.781
He looks good.

29:07.855 --> 29:09.981
If you know what I mean.

29:10.557 --> 29:12.218
I'm gonna go home.

29:17.197 --> 29:18.721
Wait a second.

29:30.776 --> 29:32.767
My wife?

29:34.913 --> 29:37.677
They should cross her...

29:37.750 --> 29:40.617
with a MacIntosh PC.

29:45.257 --> 29:47.157
Get a computer...

29:50.328 --> 29:52.353
that never goes down.

29:58.069 --> 30:00.003
This is good.

30:09.881 --> 30:11.575
That's a nasty burn.

30:11.648 --> 30:13.673
I'll have somebody come
over and take care of that.

30:13.750 --> 30:15.445
It doesn't even hurt.

30:18.689 --> 30:20.418
Hey, the shooter?

30:20.824 --> 30:23.418
I know who he is.
The net's closing.

30:24.194 --> 30:26.662
The net's closing?

30:26.730 --> 30:30.392
I like that. "The net's closing."

30:34.837 --> 30:36.964
The expediter of your dreams, pal.

30:38.674 --> 30:40.938
No, not me, brother. I'm flush.

30:41.677 --> 30:45.374
You're flush? The net's closing?

31:31.491 --> 31:33.652
- Hi?
- Yeah.

31:35.328 --> 31:36.989
Hi.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.792
My name is Glory.

31:41.134 --> 31:43.898
I'm the one who spilled the
coffee on you last night.

31:45.638 --> 31:48.232
- Oh, yeah. The bartender.
- Yeah.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.968
Frank told me to come by...

31:54.045 --> 31:56.036
and take care of your hand.

31:58.917 --> 32:02.045
Frank from last night?
He told you to do that?

32:04.923 --> 32:06.356
Can I...

32:07.392 --> 32:08.723
Your hand?

32:10.761 --> 32:12.285
Thanks.

32:31.848 --> 32:34.510
This is really stupid, I know.

32:34.584 --> 32:36.051
Whatever.

32:46.930 --> 32:48.420
Thanks.

32:49.132 --> 32:51.759
Frank wanted me to stay.

32:51.834 --> 32:53.529
Here.

32:55.170 --> 32:58.435
Make sure it heals properly.
Change the bandage and all?

32:59.541 --> 33:02.408
Whatever. I'll run down,
get more ointment.

33:03.612 --> 33:05.443
Yeah, well, how long did...

33:05.514 --> 33:07.072
Frank...

33:07.149 --> 33:10.174
How long did Frank
imagine this would be?

33:10.251 --> 33:13.049
A week. Frank said a week.

33:14.856 --> 33:16.847
Look, it's not what you think.

33:17.758 --> 33:19.419
It's not a sex thing.

33:20.328 --> 33:21.761
Jesus.

33:36.943 --> 33:39.810
Just let me sit down. Please?

33:42.949 --> 33:44.439
How's the coffee?

33:45.352 --> 33:47.582
It's so rich, I can't
believe it's instant.

33:47.654 --> 33:49.485
How's your hand?

33:50.155 --> 33:51.315
Great.

33:53.526 --> 33:55.289
You know I'm a cop, right?

33:57.663 --> 33:59.153
So I've been told.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.427
Yeah, well, anyways...

34:03.502 --> 34:05.493
I have to go to work now.

34:08.741 --> 34:11.139
So, I'll stay here?

34:11.976 --> 34:13.876
Well, this is my house, so...

34:14.812 --> 34:16.643
I'm not gonna steal anything.

34:16.714 --> 34:19.274
What's Frank's phone number?

34:19.350 --> 34:21.284
Talk to me before you
talk to Frank, okay?

34:22.987 --> 34:24.476
You saved his life.

34:24.556 --> 34:26.717
He wants me to be your
friend for a week.

34:26.791 --> 34:28.690
That's all. I swear.

34:29.494 --> 34:31.723
I'm like a thank-you present.

34:32.929 --> 34:34.556
I'm like...

34:34.630 --> 34:36.428
a seven-day singing telegram.

34:36.500 --> 34:39.663
Like those people that come to your
door in a gorilla suit with balloons.

34:39.735 --> 34:41.897
Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop.

34:41.972 --> 34:44.235
Look, I gotta get outta here.

34:44.942 --> 34:48.605
I work straight through the night.
I come back 6:00, 6:30 in the morning.

34:48.679 --> 34:50.270
No problem.

34:51.280 --> 34:54.181
- There's a TV.
- Great. Thanks.

34:56.652 --> 34:58.620
Refrigerator's in the kitchen.

34:58.688 --> 35:00.815
And outside is downstairs.

35:02.091 --> 35:03.922
Yeah, if you have a key.

35:07.897 --> 35:09.660
I'm really sorry about this.

35:11.466 --> 35:13.696
We'll straighten everything
out when I come back.

35:15.437 --> 35:16.995
Absolutely.

35:32.319 --> 35:34.651
Jimmy, come take a look at this.

35:45.132 --> 35:46.827
The net of justice closes in.

35:49.670 --> 35:51.330
Oh, Jesus.

35:52.005 --> 35:53.529
That's my shooter.

36:00.113 --> 36:01.808
That was your fault, baby.

36:01.881 --> 36:04.315
My fault? Why is it my fault?

36:04.384 --> 36:07.251
Because you are really into
pressing that red button.

36:07.320 --> 36:09.481
- No, I'm not.
- You like that shit, huh?

36:09.555 --> 36:11.283
No, I'm trying to make
you something nice.

36:11.356 --> 36:13.483
Make me something nice?

36:13.558 --> 36:15.355
I'm sorry, okay?

36:15.427 --> 36:17.122
Sorry goddamn don't get it.

36:17.195 --> 36:18.856
Sorry is for shits!

36:18.930 --> 36:21.421
Sorry is what that fuckin' meal is!

36:25.137 --> 36:28.038
I would have cleaned the place for
you, but I couldn't find any dirt.

36:28.106 --> 36:30.266
Okay, it's time to go.
Come on, get up.

36:30.341 --> 36:31.933
Why? Hey!

36:32.009 --> 36:35.308
Why? Because you people got
me surrounded. That's why.

36:35.379 --> 36:38.473
- So here's your bag. Let's go.
- What are you talking about?

36:38.549 --> 36:41.780
Frank maybe killed somebody last
night, and I don't know who you are.

36:41.852 --> 36:44.150
If Frank was involved in
something, Frank's not involved.

36:44.221 --> 36:46.382
Frank's never involved.
He's a million miles away.

36:46.457 --> 36:48.118
Let me tell you about involved.

36:48.192 --> 36:51.422
I buddy up with a guy one night, he
maybe kills somebody the next night.

36:51.494 --> 36:54.657
It comes out I got drunk with the
shooter, and his girl's in my house.

36:54.731 --> 36:56.722
Let me tell ya, that is involved.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.961
I swear to God, I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:59.002 --> 37:01.732
Whatever. Good-bye, good-bye.
Let's go. Come on.

37:01.805 --> 37:04.205
You don't understand. There's
a penalty system here.

37:04.274 --> 37:07.107
- Penalty system for who? Me?
- No, for me.

37:08.011 --> 37:10.103
You send me back,
I'll be in to him forever.

37:10.179 --> 37:11.669
Why? You owe him?

37:11.747 --> 37:13.647
I don't know what
happened with last night.

37:13.716 --> 37:16.378
I swear to God, I don't get involved
with Frank's mess. I really don't.

37:16.452 --> 37:18.443
- But you owe him?
- It's complicated.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.647
Complicated like how?

37:25.694 --> 37:27.423
Talk to me.

37:27.496 --> 37:29.760
This is my house.
Complicated like how?

37:30.998 --> 37:32.989
"There's a cash-flow problem.
I'll take it in trade."

37:33.067 --> 37:34.796
Did you ever hear him say that?

37:34.869 --> 37:37.963
My brother had the cash-flow
problem, and I'm the trade.

37:38.039 --> 37:41.202
I do whatever Frank wants until he
says my brother's in the clear.

37:41.275 --> 37:44.142
What do you mean, you do
whatever Frank wants? Like what?

37:44.212 --> 37:46.203
He said to be your
friend for a week.

37:46.280 --> 37:48.646
You saved his life.
That's all I know.

37:49.317 --> 37:51.876
You send me back, he's gonna
tell me I screwed up...

37:51.952 --> 37:53.613
add another two months, six months.

37:53.687 --> 37:56.520
With Frank, you can't
argue. You can't fight.

37:56.590 --> 37:58.717
You can't hide.

37:58.792 --> 38:00.783
So can you help me out here?

38:01.962 --> 38:03.862
Can I stay?

38:16.575 --> 38:18.338
What are you banging
on my door for?

38:18.410 --> 38:20.844
You're making a lot of
noise. What's going on?

38:20.913 --> 38:23.973
- Who are you, a sheriff? Fuck off.
- I wanna see Lee.

38:24.717 --> 38:25.809
Are you okay?

38:25.885 --> 38:28.615
- I'll snap it off at the ankle.
- It's okay.

38:28.687 --> 38:30.677
Move your foot, shit bird.

38:31.623 --> 38:33.215
Hey, I'm a police officer.

38:33.291 --> 38:36.852
Wayne, we were just arguing
in here. Everything's okay.

38:36.928 --> 38:39.294
- You're a police officer? Really?
- Yeah.

38:39.364 --> 38:41.696
Well, guess what?

38:44.803 --> 38:46.737
I'm on to you.

38:48.606 --> 38:50.470
What can you do, you know?

38:51.041 --> 38:52.838
At least you gave it a shot.

38:54.578 --> 38:56.409
Yeah, well, whatever.

38:56.980 --> 38:59.847
Do you want me to
make you some tea?

38:59.917 --> 39:01.646
No, thanks.

39:09.460 --> 39:10.790
Frank...

39:11.561 --> 39:13.392
it's going great, yeah.

39:15.098 --> 39:16.827
Frank, I swear.

39:17.834 --> 39:20.530
We haven't stopped laughing
since I came in the door.

39:21.338 --> 39:22.828
He's tickled pink.

39:26.143 --> 39:29.806
No, he can't come to the
phone right now. He's out.

39:29.880 --> 39:31.403
At work.

39:33.916 --> 39:36.852
That's none of your business.

39:37.986 --> 39:40.716
I have to... I'll call you back.

39:40.789 --> 39:42.620
I gotta go. The phone's ringing.

39:42.691 --> 39:44.420
The other phone.

39:45.060 --> 39:46.755
Hi. Did I wake you?

39:48.096 --> 39:50.290
No. I mean... No.

40:09.783 --> 40:11.841
So you gave walking
tours in school, huh?

40:11.918 --> 40:13.909
What'd you study?
History? Real estate?

40:14.387 --> 40:17.254
Acting. Like everybody
and his cousin.

40:17.957 --> 40:20.357
I gave walking tours to
make the rent some...

40:20.426 --> 40:23.259
but then I got into tending
bar because it paid better.

40:23.329 --> 40:26.992
Open up my days for more
classes, auditions.

40:27.734 --> 40:29.827
You ask a bartender or a
waiter around here...

40:29.902 --> 40:31.460
"What do you do?"

40:31.536 --> 40:33.629
They say, "I'm an
actor, I'm a singer...

40:33.705 --> 40:36.538
I'm a student, I'm a writer."

40:36.608 --> 40:39.304
After a couple years, you have
to be honest with yourself.

40:39.378 --> 40:42.142
I'm a bartender. A waiter.

40:42.214 --> 40:44.114
Waitress.

40:44.182 --> 40:47.879
Life is what happens to you while you're
waiting for your ship to come in.

40:47.953 --> 40:50.147
Cops are lucky in
that way, you know?

40:50.221 --> 40:52.280
It's hard confusing a
cop with anything else.

40:52.356 --> 40:54.381
I mean, a cop's a cop. The end.

40:56.861 --> 40:59.430
I was working as a bartender
in a club Frank owned.

40:59.563 --> 41:01.758
I knew Frank put money
on the street...

41:03.133 --> 41:05.294
so I put my brother
together with Frank.

41:06.437 --> 41:10.463
Going to Frank is like taking heroin
to cure an alcohol problem, you know?

41:12.708 --> 41:16.144
My brother can't make his payments.
Frank starts taking over.

41:16.813 --> 41:19.680
He fires everybody,
puts in his own people.

41:19.749 --> 41:21.740
He starts ordering
through the corporation.

41:21.818 --> 41:24.048
Steaks, liquor, kitchen
equipment, you name it.

41:24.120 --> 41:27.112
All to re-sell on his own 'cause
he's a silent partner, right?

41:27.190 --> 41:29.317
So he's not liable anyhow.

41:30.192 --> 41:33.593
Next thing I know, my
brother slit his wrists.

41:33.662 --> 41:35.926
And his wife's ready to
run away with his kids.

41:36.331 --> 41:37.992
So I go to Frank and say...

41:38.066 --> 41:41.399
"Leave my brother alone.
I'll do anything you want."

41:43.038 --> 41:44.403
Anyways...

41:44.973 --> 41:46.998
my brother's a waiter now.

41:47.876 --> 41:50.605
At least he's alive
and sort of intact.

41:51.545 --> 41:53.342
So what do you do for him?

41:53.414 --> 41:56.076
- This, that, the other.
- Like what?

42:02.323 --> 42:03.847
What's the difference?

42:13.399 --> 42:16.857
Could you smile a little?
Hold my hand or something?

42:29.948 --> 42:32.143
- Go home.
- Home?

42:32.217 --> 42:34.879
Yeah. Just take the keys,
and I'll be there soon.

42:56.507 --> 42:57.997
Listen, I'm a cop...

42:58.075 --> 43:01.841
and I don't like to be followed,
and I don't like her being followed.

43:02.613 --> 43:04.945
Frank just wants to make
sure that you're happy.

43:05.016 --> 43:06.415
Are you happy?

43:11.121 --> 43:12.918
I get paid either way.

43:22.632 --> 43:24.497
I said go home.

43:24.568 --> 43:26.559
I wanted to wait for you.

43:27.971 --> 43:30.939
- Okay, let's go.
- Can I tell you something? Come here.

43:31.006 --> 43:33.065
- I gotta go.
- Gimme five minutes.

43:34.910 --> 43:36.901
Go ahead. I'll be there.

43:46.288 --> 43:48.688
They found the gun
that did your shooter.

43:48.757 --> 43:51.156
- Yeah? Where?
- On some other dead mutt.

43:51.926 --> 43:53.917
Bullshit, he got taken
out by Frank Milo.

43:53.995 --> 43:55.826
Milo probably did this guy too.

43:55.897 --> 43:58.957
Left the gun with the body so it
looks like a neat solve. It's a plant.

43:59.033 --> 44:01.024
It's a solve, and
nobody gives a shit.

44:01.102 --> 44:04.333
Two dead mutts in muttland.
5:00. Time to go home.

44:04.939 --> 44:06.429
It's a plant.

44:09.377 --> 44:10.900
Who's the babe?

44:12.546 --> 44:14.036
A friend.

44:14.615 --> 44:16.139
Oh, yeah?

44:19.419 --> 44:22.946
What happened to the
girl next door? Lee?

44:26.159 --> 44:29.651
She's a nice lady. This one's a
little too fast for you, no?

44:33.599 --> 44:36.329
- You okay? What's the matter?
- Nothing.

44:42.408 --> 44:44.137
Hey, that's the one.

44:44.210 --> 44:46.508
Jesus, look at that shiner.

44:47.179 --> 44:49.807
Looks like that dog on The Little
Rascals. Who is it, Petey?

44:49.881 --> 44:52.111
She's getting smacked around.

44:54.619 --> 44:56.052
By him?

44:56.121 --> 44:58.715
I had a talk with him.
The guy's on the job.

44:58.790 --> 45:01.190
He's on the job? So fucking what?
You had a talk with him?

45:01.259 --> 45:02.419
Yeah.

45:03.161 --> 45:05.891
- And?
- He's an asshole.

45:12.102 --> 45:13.501
Oh, yeah?

45:15.773 --> 45:17.263
Hold this, please.

45:29.053 --> 45:32.215
How ya doin', Sis?
This is my sister.

45:32.889 --> 45:34.857
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

45:35.058 --> 45:37.026
What, you walk into a door, Sis?

45:37.694 --> 45:39.719
What, she walk into a door?

45:40.396 --> 45:42.436
You're not fucking hittin'
her or anything, are you?

45:42.465 --> 45:44.399
- It's okay.
- What is your fucking problem?

45:44.467 --> 45:45.900
Tommy, I need your towel.

45:48.604 --> 45:52.095
Slip your piece under the towel.
Tommy will hold it for you till after.

45:54.342 --> 45:56.537
Come on, you fuckin' hump.
Come on, you hero.

45:56.611 --> 45:59.102
I want a taste of you.
Come on, get up.

45:59.181 --> 46:01.376
I got no beef with you.

46:01.450 --> 46:04.317
Slip your piece under the towel.

46:04.386 --> 46:06.320
I got no beef with you.

46:09.491 --> 46:11.754
Are you sweet?
Is that your problem?

46:18.132 --> 46:20.760
- Come on, I'm on the job.
- You ain't on my fuckin' job.

46:26.073 --> 46:27.665
Hey, come on.

46:28.342 --> 46:30.536
You lost her address,
her phone number...

46:30.610 --> 46:33.204
you can't even remember
what she looks like.

46:33.279 --> 46:34.803
Right?

46:37.450 --> 46:39.918
- Yeah, right.
- What's her name?

46:39.986 --> 46:41.954
I don't know, okay?

46:42.956 --> 46:45.925
Don't even turn around
to say good-bye.

46:57.703 --> 47:01.161
Hey, Chivas and milk.
I never forget a neck.

47:03.108 --> 47:05.406
You should try that
shit with me sometime.

47:05.978 --> 47:08.845
Yeah? Different strokes
for different folks.

47:30.133 --> 47:32.124
No guts, no glory, right?

47:40.610 --> 47:42.908
- Smoke, smoke.
- What?

47:42.979 --> 47:44.003
Smoke.

47:44.080 --> 47:45.547
You mean pot, crack, what?

47:45.615 --> 47:48.015
Get smart with me, I'll
bust a cap in your ass.

47:48.185 --> 47:50.709
You wanna do Dodge City
with me, motherfucker?

47:50.786 --> 47:53.346
- Hey, you crazy?
- Crazy? I'm a fuckin' mad dog.

47:58.093 --> 47:59.822
Jesus.

48:27.655 --> 48:31.021
Frank, you're making
him strong again.

48:36.163 --> 48:37.653
Where were you?

48:37.731 --> 48:39.289
What do you do for him?

48:39.366 --> 48:40.890
Who, Frank?

48:41.902 --> 48:43.233
I tend bar.

48:43.303 --> 48:45.134
- What else?
- Deliver things.

48:45.205 --> 48:47.196
- What things?
- Some pretty weird shit.

48:47.274 --> 48:49.744
Like what?

48:50.009 --> 48:53.308
Once I took this box up
to a guy in Detroit.

48:53.379 --> 48:54.971
I took the Greyhound.

48:55.048 --> 48:57.516
So I'm sitting on the bus
six hours, wondering.

48:57.584 --> 48:59.950
I go into the bathroom in the back.

49:00.019 --> 49:02.010
I open the box and look inside.

49:02.088 --> 49:04.079
There was a human hand in there...

49:04.157 --> 49:06.421
with manicured nails
and a wedding band.

49:06.493 --> 49:08.290
I almost died.

49:08.361 --> 49:10.021
I get up to Detroit.

49:10.095 --> 49:12.893
I deliver it to some guy behind
a counter in a bowling alley.

49:12.965 --> 49:16.526
This guy, he opens the
box, looks inside...

49:16.602 --> 49:19.594
and he gives me a tip like
I was delivering takeout.

49:19.671 --> 49:21.195
You sleep with him?

49:21.840 --> 49:25.139
With Frank? I don't
think he has sex.

49:25.210 --> 49:26.939
Does he make you sleep
with anybody else?

49:27.913 --> 49:29.210
No.

49:30.414 --> 49:32.143
He's got girls for that.

49:32.216 --> 49:34.582
The "Frank Milo dancers,"
he calls them.

49:35.253 --> 49:37.653
So you never had to sleep
with anybody else?

49:42.193 --> 49:44.684
One time, the guy from
the bowling alley?

49:44.762 --> 49:47.356
He came into town and
he asked for me...

49:47.431 --> 49:50.695
and Frank said I had to go out with
him, but what happened was up to me.

49:51.635 --> 49:54.570
What happened was he was a lot
physically strong than me...

49:56.606 --> 49:58.301
so I survived.

49:59.342 --> 50:02.175
Oh, Jesus. She survived.

50:06.917 --> 50:08.714
Okay, what about me?

50:08.785 --> 50:10.376
What if I get horny?

50:10.452 --> 50:11.885
You're a thank-you present, right?

50:11.954 --> 50:14.650
Why is it the worst thing a guy can
imagine happening to a woman...

50:14.723 --> 50:16.190
is that she fucked some other guy?

50:16.258 --> 50:18.590
I never said that. That's
not what I'm driving at.

50:18.661 --> 50:21.528
- What are you driving at?
- I don't know, okay?

50:21.597 --> 50:25.226
I do what I can for people, but I'm
no warrior. I'm no hero. Sorry.

50:27.102 --> 50:29.764
I'm not asking you
to save me, Wayne.

50:31.472 --> 50:34.032
So you need to be saved, right?

50:34.108 --> 50:36.201
Tell me. You need
to be saved, right?

50:37.412 --> 50:40.404
Look, for the next five days...

50:40.481 --> 50:42.642
let's just pretend we're
your basic, normal couple.

50:42.717 --> 50:44.378
- Normal.
- Watch TV.

50:44.452 --> 50:46.079
TV. Right.

50:48.323 --> 50:51.621
Frank! Stop it! Stop
the machine, Frank!

50:51.692 --> 50:53.626
Don't pull that switch!

51:08.041 --> 51:09.974
Wayne, could you put
your arm around me?

51:15.748 --> 51:19.309
- Where's Varsdic?
- He said he'd blow up the dam.

53:07.254 --> 53:09.552
If you don't wanna do anything,
that's okay with me.

53:09.623 --> 53:11.749
I'll go with that.

53:11.825 --> 53:15.761
- Okay, I don't wanna do anything.
- Good. That's okay.

53:17.931 --> 53:19.956
You're a sweet man, you know that?

53:20.033 --> 53:22.695
Hey, no kiddin'. If you
don't wanna do it...

53:22.769 --> 53:24.703
it's, it's okay.

53:34.413 --> 53:36.677
Open your lips.

53:36.749 --> 53:38.683
I know how to kiss.

53:49.395 --> 53:52.261
You know, I oughta...
I should do some sit-ups.

53:52.330 --> 53:54.958
- Right now?
- No, I mean, you know, in general.

54:04.742 --> 54:06.869
Are you my hero? Are you my man?

54:24.227 --> 54:26.161
You're a sweet man.

54:29.066 --> 54:31.829
- Watch out for next time.
- Fair enough.

54:32.968 --> 54:35.903
I haven't made love in two years.

54:35.971 --> 54:37.905
Made love. I like that.

54:37.973 --> 54:42.171
You talk like someone out
of the Round Table days.

54:42.244 --> 54:44.542
Sir Lancelot.

54:44.613 --> 54:46.205
Galahad.

54:54.756 --> 54:56.690
The thing about
photographing death...

54:56.758 --> 54:58.692
There's no dignity in death.

54:58.760 --> 55:00.819
The body can't defend itself.

55:00.895 --> 55:02.920
Can't pull its skirt down.

55:04.332 --> 55:06.493
Can't close its mouth.

55:06.568 --> 55:10.697
Cops are walkin' around the crime
scene, everything's a joke.

55:10.771 --> 55:12.705
What you're photographing
on the job...

55:12.773 --> 55:16.209
is like the worst
kind of helplessness.

55:16.276 --> 55:18.904
You know why I became a cop?

55:18.979 --> 55:23.245
My father, his whole life he was
a sales clerk in a hat store.

55:23.317 --> 55:24.909
A real invisible man.

55:24.985 --> 55:28.318
Spent his whole life doin' that.
Takin' shit from people.

55:28.388 --> 55:30.321
I was so afraid I'd
wind up like him...

55:30.389 --> 55:32.550
I panicked and became a policeman.

55:32.625 --> 55:34.559
Kinda overreacted, you know?

55:38.364 --> 55:39.956
It's so quiet.

55:42.034 --> 55:44.059
I can't believe I'm here with you.

55:44.137 --> 55:46.071
One time, about 3:00
in the morning...

55:46.139 --> 55:49.006
I was set up right here,
lookin' down this street.

55:49.075 --> 55:53.511
I'm lookin' right down, I swear
to God. You know what I see?

55:53.578 --> 55:58.283
A goddamn deer is standing there
at that intersection down there.

55:58.416 --> 56:01.078
I couldn't believe it.
I almost had a heart attack.

56:01.152 --> 56:03.279
I don't know where it came from.

56:03.354 --> 56:05.555
Maybe it swam over from Indiana,
escaped from the zoo...

56:05.590 --> 56:07.524
but there it was, this, this deer.

56:07.592 --> 56:10.754
Me and this deer at 3:00
a.m. in the morning.

56:13.830 --> 56:15.764
Let me show you that
photo of the deer.

56:18.969 --> 56:21.164
- Would you photograph me?
- No, you don't want...

56:21.238 --> 56:24.571
With the people I take pictures
of, it would be bad luck.

56:24.641 --> 56:27.735
- Come on.
- No way. Sorry.

56:35.151 --> 56:38.279
- Wayne, come on.
- No, it would freak me out.

56:41.223 --> 56:43.157
Where the hell did I put it?

59:29.150 --> 59:31.083
All right. All right.

59:35.422 --> 59:36.719
Smile for the birdie.

59:42.662 --> 59:44.254
Do me.

01:00:42.253 --> 01:00:44.721
It's so weird, you wearing
a gun to work every day.

01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:47.724
- I keep forgetting, you know?
- Hey, no guts, no glory.

01:01:10.111 --> 01:01:13.512
You see? I told you, Wayne.
This food can kill you.

01:01:13.581 --> 01:01:15.811
Waiter says guy walks
in, comes up...

01:01:15.883 --> 01:01:19.182
bop-bop, back of the
head, walks right out.

01:01:19.253 --> 01:01:21.187
Gangland, USA. Gino Coraldi...

01:01:21.255 --> 01:01:23.348
was sitting down to some calamari.

01:01:23.424 --> 01:01:27.827
He'd just stolen the account books
of Alphonse "The Wolf" Lupo.

01:01:27.895 --> 01:01:31.193
He felt like celebrating.

01:01:31.264 --> 01:01:33.528
About right?

01:01:35.001 --> 01:01:39.131
I'm just a gigolo Everywhere I go

01:01:39.206 --> 01:01:42.437
People know the part I'm playing

01:01:42.509 --> 01:01:44.739
Pay for every dance

01:01:44.811 --> 01:01:46.574
Selling each romance

01:01:46.646 --> 01:01:49.615
Louis Prima! The best!

01:01:49.683 --> 01:01:52.048
And there will come a day

01:01:52.118 --> 01:01:54.780
When youth will pass away

01:01:54.854 --> 01:01:57.322
What will they say about me

01:01:57.389 --> 01:02:02.053
When the end comes I know
They'll say just a gigolo

01:02:02.128 --> 01:02:05.154
Life goes on without me 'cause

01:02:05.231 --> 01:02:11.692
I ain't got nobody

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.260
- Nobody
- No, and there's

01:02:13.338 --> 01:02:16.774
Nobody that cares for me

01:02:16.841 --> 01:02:20.777
There's nobody that cares for me

01:02:20.845 --> 01:02:27.307
- I'm so sad and lonely
- I am sad and lonely

01:02:27.385 --> 01:02:29.319
Sad and lonely Sad and lonely

01:02:29.387 --> 01:02:33.083
Won't some sweet mama come
take a chance with me

01:02:33.157 --> 01:02:35.216
'Cause I ain't so bad

01:02:38.495 --> 01:02:41.896
What do you think
is the motive here?

01:02:41.965 --> 01:02:46.163
When the end comes I know
They'll say just a gigolo

01:02:46.236 --> 01:02:49.830
Life goes on without me 'cause

01:02:49.906 --> 01:02:56.209
I ain't got nobody

01:02:56.279 --> 01:02:58.213
What, did you get laid last night?

01:02:58.281 --> 01:03:01.045
Mike, I don't get laid.
I make love.

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.112
Thank you.

01:03:10.492 --> 01:03:11.789
Hi, Wayne.

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.124
- Hey, Mike.
- Swear to God, it's true.

01:03:14.196 --> 01:03:16.391
Then my friend Phil.

01:03:16.464 --> 01:03:18.728
Philly applies to the
police department.

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.236
Interviewer says, "Mr.
Scarangelo, what's your height?"

01:03:22.304 --> 01:03:26.468
Philly reads off his palm,
"Six foot, three inches."

01:03:26.541 --> 01:03:28.736
Guy says, "What's your weight?"

01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:31.744
"Uh, 203 pounds."

01:03:31.812 --> 01:03:34.576
Guy says, "And can you
tell me your first name?"

01:03:34.648 --> 01:03:36.240
Philly goes...

01:03:38.452 --> 01:03:40.386
"Philly."

01:03:40.454 --> 01:03:44.481
The interviewer says, "What was that
you did with your head like that?"

01:03:44.558 --> 01:03:46.219
Philly goes...

01:03:46.293 --> 01:03:48.693
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

01:03:50.997 --> 01:03:53.329
That's nothin'.

01:03:53.399 --> 01:03:54.866
I said to my wife, "Hey!

01:03:54.934 --> 01:03:58.665
Did you ever hear of
clean-ing, cook-ing?"

01:03:58.738 --> 01:04:01.536
She says, "Two cities in China?"

01:04:04.043 --> 01:04:05.977
My wife said this!

01:04:10.215 --> 01:04:13.412
Hey! There he is!

01:04:13.485 --> 01:04:15.419
I just come by.

01:04:16.388 --> 01:04:18.322
I went in on a bakery.

01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:20.858
Pineapple-Sour Cream.

01:04:33.471 --> 01:04:35.063
Eat.

01:04:36.641 --> 01:04:40.941
- You look drawn.
- What are you doing here?

01:04:41.012 --> 01:04:45.142
I don't know. Harold said you
didn't seem so happy the other day.

01:04:45.216 --> 01:04:48.151
I was in the neighborhood, so I
thought I'd check in with you.

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:55.121
So how's it goin'?

01:04:57.093 --> 01:04:59.653
- How's that burn on your hand?
- Doing fine.

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:04.691
- Nice-nice?
- Fine.

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:06.702
The gift that keeps on givin'.

01:05:09.506 --> 01:05:11.097
What's wrong?

01:05:17.913 --> 01:05:20.381
She's yankin' your chain, right?

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:23.413
Messin' with your head?

01:05:23.485 --> 01:05:25.419
Sure. Look at ya.

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:28.456
Givin' you sob stories, I bet.

01:05:28.524 --> 01:05:30.855
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:05:30.925 --> 01:05:33.621
Then quit givin' me that look, Ma.

01:05:33.695 --> 01:05:36.061
I'm your sonny boy.

01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:38.064
Want me to sing for you?

01:05:41.602 --> 01:05:43.229
May I?

01:05:46.174 --> 01:05:48.039
I gotta go.

01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:52.335
Look.

01:05:52.412 --> 01:05:55.438
I'm doing Comic-Cazie tomorrow.
You should come.

01:05:59.553 --> 01:06:02.545
Unless, you know, you're busy.

01:06:02.622 --> 01:06:06.080
- What the fuck is he doin' here?
- I don't know.

01:06:06.159 --> 01:06:10.458
- That's the guy I told you about.
- Fuck you. And who are you?

01:06:10.529 --> 01:06:12.929
This is, uh, Frank.

01:06:12.999 --> 01:06:14.296
Frank Milo?

01:06:17.136 --> 01:06:18.626
You've heard of me?

01:06:20.606 --> 01:06:23.006
Yeah.

01:06:23.075 --> 01:06:26.075
Wayne says you killed that mutt we found
in the garbage can the other night.

01:06:30.482 --> 01:06:34.009
I thought maybe you'd heard of me in
the clubs... you know, comic circles.

01:06:34.085 --> 01:06:36.451
No, just scumbag circles. Sorry.

01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:41.281
Jesus Christ.

01:06:41.359 --> 01:06:43.293
Is this what's troublin' you?

01:06:43.361 --> 01:06:45.852
I'm kinda jammed up here, Frank.

01:06:47.665 --> 01:06:49.962
I thought we were friends.

01:06:52.403 --> 01:06:55.133
Two guys wished they
were someplace else.

01:07:00.110 --> 01:07:01.702
Whatever.

01:07:03.113 --> 01:07:05.445
All right, I'll come by...

01:07:05.516 --> 01:07:07.575
Let's see, tonight's Thursday.

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:12.149
I'll come by, pick her up Monday.

01:07:12.221 --> 01:07:15.657
Okay? Monday morning.

01:07:19.395 --> 01:07:20.623
See ya, Ma.

01:07:25.968 --> 01:07:28.766
And, incidentally, I don't know
what you're talkin' about...

01:07:28.838 --> 01:07:31.863
a guy in a garbage pail, but, uh...

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:36.377
most of the people I know
who don't die in bed...

01:07:36.445 --> 01:07:38.743
they usually wind up
killing themselves.

01:07:58.032 --> 01:08:01.024
Pick who up Monday? What's up, man?

01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:06.271
I don't know. I don't
know, you know?

01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:19.274
Hello?

01:08:19.352 --> 01:08:21.546
What are you trying to pull now?

01:08:21.621 --> 01:08:23.589
Frank, hi.

01:08:23.656 --> 01:08:26.523
I want you out of there by Monday.

01:08:26.593 --> 01:08:28.527
No more head trips on this chump...

01:08:28.595 --> 01:08:30.562
or you will be the one
with the problem.

01:08:30.629 --> 01:08:33.529
Hey, he's not a chump, okay?

01:08:33.599 --> 01:08:36.397
I told you I was doin' you
a big favor with this.

01:08:36.468 --> 01:08:39.062
I hate it when people take
advantage of my favors.

01:08:39.138 --> 01:08:41.698
Taking advantage? Come on, Frank.

01:08:41.773 --> 01:08:44.435
And then I'm gonna do you
one more big favor...

01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:48.377
and this'll be about the
last thing you do for me.

01:08:48.447 --> 01:08:51.471
It's for a friend of a
friend from Detroit.

01:08:52.617 --> 01:08:54.448
Thanks, Frank.

01:08:57.388 --> 01:09:01.620
I'll be there. I'll be there.

01:09:01.692 --> 01:09:06.095
Whatever happens is up to me.
Where have I heard that before?

01:09:06.163 --> 01:09:08.826
I'm not...

01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:11.390
I'm not giving you lip.

01:09:11.468 --> 01:09:13.060
I'm not.

01:09:13.136 --> 01:09:14.728
I'm sorry.

01:09:16.872 --> 01:09:19.808
When have I not been good company?

01:09:27.951 --> 01:09:29.917
What, you got a date
from Detroit comin' up?

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:33.682
It's not till next week.

01:09:33.756 --> 01:09:36.725
We still have three fun-filled
days and nights here.

01:09:36.792 --> 01:09:39.225
Let's make the most of it, okay?

01:09:56.077 --> 01:09:57.942
You're not goin' back to him.

01:10:00.448 --> 01:10:02.348
It's not the end of the world.

01:10:02.417 --> 01:10:05.147
Yeah, it is.

01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:06.551
I love you.

01:10:13.427 --> 01:10:15.418
There's nothing you
can do about it.

01:10:15.495 --> 01:10:18.396
- What can you do about it?
- I said I love you.

01:11:01.072 --> 01:11:03.632
I don't want another one of those.

01:11:03.708 --> 01:11:05.642
It wasn't her fault.

01:11:05.710 --> 01:11:09.077
Hey. Your pal. What's
his name, uh, Frank?

01:11:09.914 --> 01:11:13.042
He sent it over. I saved two
pieces in the fridge for ya.

01:11:13.117 --> 01:11:15.210
Yeah, what is he, a baker?

01:11:15.286 --> 01:11:17.584
He's killin' me with this crap.

01:11:26.964 --> 01:11:29.296
Oh, Jesus.

01:11:42.344 --> 01:11:44.471
Are you doing anything
urgent on Monday?

01:11:48.017 --> 01:11:50.109
What time?

01:11:54.122 --> 01:11:56.750
One floor below me You
don't even know me

01:11:56.825 --> 01:11:58.918
I love you

01:12:01.429 --> 01:12:04.398
On the ceiling if you want me

01:12:07.402 --> 01:12:09.666
If the answer is no

01:12:14.241 --> 01:12:18.337
Means you'll meet me in the hallway

01:12:18.412 --> 01:12:20.744
Twice on the pipe

01:12:20.814 --> 01:12:24.875
Means you ain't gonna show

01:12:24.952 --> 01:12:28.683
Hey, "occifer," what's the word?

01:12:28.755 --> 01:12:32.190
- Nothin' much.
- She comin' down?

01:12:32.258 --> 01:12:36.251
Where's she gonna fit?
Looks like a full boat.

01:12:36.329 --> 01:12:38.263
She can sit on my lap.

01:12:40.867 --> 01:12:42.129
She comin' down?

01:12:50.842 --> 01:12:54.369
You wouldn't believe what happened
this week. It's crazy, man.

01:12:54.446 --> 01:12:56.676
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:12:56.748 --> 01:13:01.117
Uh, listen, I'm serious.

01:13:01.186 --> 01:13:03.017
We're, uh, we're in love.

01:13:04.055 --> 01:13:07.354
And I think we're gonna...
we're gonna live together.

01:13:07.425 --> 01:13:09.790
Maybe even get married. Who knows?

01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:17.492
Yeah, well, I'm serious.
I swear to God.

01:13:17.568 --> 01:13:19.968
That's life, you know?

01:13:20.037 --> 01:13:23.006
"That's life." Fuckin' Wayne.

01:13:23.073 --> 01:13:26.531
You give him a hand,
he takes the whole arm.

01:13:29.246 --> 01:13:31.145
Bring her down.

01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:35.915
I love her.

01:13:35.985 --> 01:13:39.978
You love her. I own her!

01:13:50.132 --> 01:13:52.191
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!

01:13:52.267 --> 01:13:56.260
Didn't I call it right on the nose
when I saw you in the office?

01:13:56.338 --> 01:14:00.104
You're a schmuck if you don't think
she's playing you like a violin.

01:14:11.085 --> 01:14:12.677
Women.

01:14:14.255 --> 01:14:18.453
Fuckin' women... You can't live
with 'em, you can't kill 'em.

01:14:21.429 --> 01:14:23.989
Okay, if you want...

01:14:24.065 --> 01:14:26.761
you can assume the debt.

01:14:26.834 --> 01:14:29.496
- Assume the debt?
- Yeah.

01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:31.503
Be my friend.

01:14:31.571 --> 01:14:34.404
For what, I don't exactly
know. You're a cop.

01:14:34.474 --> 01:14:37.443
Maybe somethin', maybe nothin'.

01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:40.240
You want me to forget about
her, for the next year...

01:14:40.313 --> 01:14:43.680
if I call you, you have
to pick up the phone.

01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:45.684
That I can live with.

01:14:54.059 --> 01:14:56.619
- I can't do that.
- Then send her down.

01:14:59.665 --> 01:15:01.792
I can't do that either.

01:15:26.190 --> 01:15:29.182
- Hello.
- How ya doin'?

01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:31.318
Good. And you?

01:15:31.395 --> 01:15:32.987
I'm good.

01:15:43.607 --> 01:15:45.165
Are you heeled?

01:16:15.203 --> 01:16:19.333
Did they ever catch the guy who did
the shithead in the garbage can?

01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:26.172
She don't love you

01:16:26.247 --> 01:16:29.512
Like I love you

01:16:42.663 --> 01:16:45.188
Watch the glass door, asshole!

01:16:52.572 --> 01:16:54.437
Who's up there, Wayne?

01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:59.139
I love her.

01:16:59.212 --> 01:17:01.874
Jesus Christ.

01:17:01.948 --> 01:17:03.973
Come on. Let's go see.

01:17:24.136 --> 01:17:26.934
You always get someone else
to fight your fights for you?

01:17:31.642 --> 01:17:33.940
Who am I to talk, right?
You okay, Harold?

01:17:45.289 --> 01:17:48.816
Given the fact that wild horses couldn't
get you to tell me where she is...

01:17:48.893 --> 01:17:50.826
Stop me if I'm wrong...

01:17:50.894 --> 01:17:54.330
this is the best I can do for ya.

01:17:54.397 --> 01:17:57.457
Now, the cash value of
her services to me...

01:17:57.534 --> 01:17:59.968
projected over one year...

01:18:00.036 --> 01:18:02.937
would be 70...

01:18:03.006 --> 01:18:06.908
$ 75,000. You wanna buy her?

01:18:06.976 --> 01:18:10.001
- 75,000?
- Okay.

01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:13.241
The money store...

01:18:13.315 --> 01:18:17.581
is gonna run a founder's
day sale... 50.

01:18:17.653 --> 01:18:21.282
No. No. You saved my life.

01:18:21.356 --> 01:18:24.951
You can have her for 40,000.

01:18:25.027 --> 01:18:27.222
Forty.

01:18:27.296 --> 01:18:30.628
If you don't have it, you
can borrow it from me.

01:18:30.698 --> 01:18:35.431
You can pay me back with a
personal services contract.

01:18:35.503 --> 01:18:37.334
Fuck you.

01:18:37.405 --> 01:18:40.272
Fuck me? Okay.

01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:42.400
Fuck me then.

01:18:42.476 --> 01:18:45.673
Go to your credit union,
go to your bank...

01:18:45.746 --> 01:18:48.738
go to Household Finance,
go to your mother.

01:18:48.816 --> 01:18:50.749
You got three days.

01:18:50.817 --> 01:18:53.877
I want 40,000, or I want Glory.

01:18:53.954 --> 01:18:56.684
This shit today, Wayne?

01:18:56.756 --> 01:18:59.190
This was fuckin' Romper Room.

01:19:01.828 --> 01:19:04.126
You like baseball?

01:19:04.197 --> 01:19:07.633
You get this straight with me,
I'll take you to some Sox games.

01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:10.601
I got a season's box.

01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:13.103
Forty in three, chief.

01:19:17.376 --> 01:19:19.310
- That guy bites.
- Yeah.

01:19:28.487 --> 01:19:31.011
- It's over.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:19:31.089 --> 01:19:34.115
- He backed off?
- He's history.

01:19:34.192 --> 01:19:37.127
I owe you one. I owe you ten.

01:19:37.195 --> 01:19:40.995
- What the hell's goin' on?
- It's complicated. It's nothin'.

01:19:41.065 --> 01:19:42.999
Welcome to the world.

01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:48.930
Mike, he's a businessman. He
wants to stay in business.

01:19:49.007 --> 01:19:51.873
He's fightin' with cops.
There's no percentage in that.

01:19:53.076 --> 01:19:56.375
That's it. Thanks, man.

01:20:02.919 --> 01:20:06.116
- So, I'm really out of here?
- Out of here?

01:20:07.291 --> 01:20:09.781
Yeah. You know what
I mean. I mean, I'm free?

01:20:10.626 --> 01:20:12.719
I can hop on a plane and vanish?

01:20:12.795 --> 01:20:15.559
If that's what you wanted to do.

01:20:15.631 --> 01:20:18.532
No, I mean, I'm just sayin'.
You know, hypothetical.

01:20:18.601 --> 01:20:20.796
'Cause in a couple of days,
you can go to the moon...

01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:23.270
and take cooking classes
for all Frank cares.

01:20:23.339 --> 01:20:26.308
In a few days? Why not now?

01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:31.476
He asked me to ask you to
sit tight a few days...

01:20:31.546 --> 01:20:33.707
so he can take care of loose ends.

01:20:33.782 --> 01:20:35.477
Loose ends?

01:20:36.584 --> 01:20:40.315
You know, he said he had to get
coverage for that guy from Detroit.

01:20:57.904 --> 01:21:01.465
It's a goddamn steal. The guy said
40 on his desk by Wednesday.

01:21:01.541 --> 01:21:03.771
He'll let me have it for 65
with a personal mortgage...

01:21:03.843 --> 01:21:05.834
between me and him for the rest.

01:21:05.912 --> 01:21:08.972
The guy's desperate. The house has
gotta be worth at least a hundred.

01:21:09.049 --> 01:21:12.506
- I just have to make the 40.
- Lake Zurich.

01:21:12.584 --> 01:21:16.213
- What the hell you gonna do up there?
- Nothing. I'll flip it.

01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:19.086
Lend me five, I'll give you
back seven when I flip it.

01:21:20.926 --> 01:21:22.359
I don't have it.

01:21:32.670 --> 01:21:34.604
Don't you wanna know what it's for?

01:21:37.408 --> 01:21:40.172
It's for this real dream
house up in Lake Zurich.

01:21:42.947 --> 01:21:45.177
How much does he want for her?

01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:51.385
More than I got.

01:21:51.455 --> 01:21:55.152
- You gonna help me or not?
- He ain't gettin' my money. Sorry.

01:22:08.905 --> 01:22:10.838
How much am I goin' for?

01:22:13.576 --> 01:22:16.136
- Forty thousand.
- That all?

01:22:17.179 --> 01:22:19.773
Knocked down from 75.

01:22:19.849 --> 01:22:21.783
Must be out of season.

01:22:26.422 --> 01:22:29.585
- Where'd you get it?
- Doesn't matter.

01:22:31.092 --> 01:22:33.692
I could only come up with $27,500.
You think he'll come down more?

01:22:36.598 --> 01:22:38.964
Jesus Christ.

01:22:51.512 --> 01:22:53.810
I just thought of somethin'.

01:22:53.881 --> 01:22:57.874
This thing comes off, people say to
you, "Where'd you get the blond?"

01:22:57.951 --> 01:23:01.284
You can say, "From the money store,
marked down from 75 to 27,500."

01:23:01.355 --> 01:23:04.085
- No, I'd never say that.
- I'm going home, Wayne.

01:23:04.158 --> 01:23:07.059
- Tell Frank to pick me up at home.
- No, no!

01:23:07.127 --> 01:23:09.822
Look, I just spent a year
being somebody's property.

01:23:09.896 --> 01:23:13.593
- Now, what, you're gonna buy me?
- No, I'm asking you, stay with me.

01:23:13.666 --> 01:23:16.567
Frank kept you, not me.
I'm not him. I'm asking you.

01:23:16.636 --> 01:23:19.833
If you wanna get some air,
it's okay, I understand.

01:23:19.906 --> 01:23:23.239
I'm not stopping you. It's okay.

01:23:23.309 --> 01:23:26.870
I can't go through with this.
Save your money. Take it.

01:23:28.247 --> 01:23:29.838
Take it.

01:23:45.263 --> 01:23:47.197
Don't be a stranger.

01:24:41.817 --> 01:24:43.751
I got a sense of deja vu.

01:24:44.953 --> 01:24:47.478
Me too.

01:24:48.824 --> 01:24:51.485
- You got the money?
- Nope.

01:24:51.559 --> 01:24:53.993
Right.

01:24:54.962 --> 01:24:57.590
Now I gotta get my big fuckin'
ape to go upstairs and get her?

01:24:57.665 --> 01:25:02.295
Maybe she's there, maybe
she's not, right? Deja vu.

01:25:02.370 --> 01:25:04.838
Well, guess what.

01:25:04.906 --> 01:25:07.739
I'm not even gonna deal
with that right now.

01:25:07.808 --> 01:25:09.742
I told you once before...

01:25:09.809 --> 01:25:12.972
don't ever disrespect me,
don't ever underestimate me.

01:25:13.046 --> 01:25:16.447
If you do, your life
becomes a raging sea.

01:25:21.855 --> 01:25:23.345
Get in the car.

01:25:28.595 --> 01:25:31.791
- Get in the car.
- What are you doing? I'm a cop.

01:25:31.864 --> 01:25:33.195
You're shit.

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.409
What's up, Mad Dog?

01:25:51.349 --> 01:25:52.976
The 7th Cavalry.

01:25:53.051 --> 01:25:55.952
What's that make us, the
friggin' Comanches?

01:26:04.762 --> 01:26:07.026
You think we're gonna have a
great big street fight now?

01:26:15.772 --> 01:26:18.605
We'll go away. But you know what?

01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:22.477
We'll get her. Somebody'll get her.

01:26:24.214 --> 01:26:27.274
A hit and run, a mugging.

01:26:27.351 --> 01:26:29.615
Do you know what botulism is?

01:26:29.686 --> 01:26:31.983
We can get her with soup.

01:26:33.923 --> 01:26:35.515
Get you too.

01:26:38.327 --> 01:26:42.787
Accidents happen all the time.

01:26:42.865 --> 01:26:45.390
Then let's end it today.

01:26:45.468 --> 01:26:47.561
Fine. Bring her down.

01:26:47.637 --> 01:26:50.196
I can't be alone anymore.
I'd rather be dead.

01:26:50.272 --> 01:26:53.639
- That's your fuckin' problem.
- Come on, you and me.

01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:57.041
- You and me?
- Now. Right now.

01:26:57.112 --> 01:26:59.945
- Hey, grow up.
- Please. Please!

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:04.509
I'll fuckin' kill you!
I don't care! I don't...

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:06.520
I... I don't! I don't care!

01:27:06.588 --> 01:27:09.056
- I'll fuckin' kill you right now!
- Wayne, take it easy.

01:27:09.124 --> 01:27:12.581
- I'll shoot you and eat my fuckin' gun!
- Are you fuckin' nuts?

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:15.754
- Fight me!
- Come on, Wayne!

01:27:15.829 --> 01:27:18.059
Come on, Wayne. It's a girl.

01:27:18.132 --> 01:27:21.295
- Fight me for her!
- Put it down.

01:27:21.368 --> 01:27:23.802
- That's playground, Wayne.
- Fight me for her!

01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:26.339
- It's getting real crazy here.
- Fight me!

01:27:26.407 --> 01:27:28.500
- Wayne, come on, man.
- Fight me!

01:27:28.575 --> 01:27:30.542
- Wayne.
- Now!

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:35.572
Put it down.

01:27:37.450 --> 01:27:39.714
Put it down, put it down.

01:27:39.786 --> 01:27:41.720
- Put it down, man.
- I'm puttin' it down!

01:27:45.258 --> 01:27:46.452
Get him, Frank!

01:27:53.165 --> 01:27:56.362
Wayne, get that piece of shit!

01:27:56.435 --> 01:27:58.426
- Come on, Wayne!
- Hit him!

01:27:58.503 --> 01:28:01.165
Hit him, Wayne!

01:28:04.743 --> 01:28:06.040
Fuckin' A, Frank! Get him again!

01:28:10.548 --> 01:28:13.346
- You fuckin' piece of garbage!
- Hit him, Frankie!

01:28:13.417 --> 01:28:16.545
- Kick him, Frankie! Go ahead!
- Get him, Wayne!

01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:20.112
- Get that garbage! Get him, Wayne!
- Come on, Wayne!

01:28:25.296 --> 01:28:27.662
Look what she's doin' to us, man.

01:28:27.732 --> 01:28:29.995
Look what she's doin'
to our friendship, man!

01:28:30.066 --> 01:28:33.331
- Then quit.
- Lay down. Stay down.

01:28:33.403 --> 01:28:35.530
- Come on, Wayne!
- Stay down.

01:28:35.605 --> 01:28:38.403
Stay down, Wayne. Stay down.

01:28:41.878 --> 01:28:43.844
- Grab him!
- Break his ass, Frank.

01:28:43.913 --> 01:28:45.881
- Go for it!
- Come on!

01:28:47.884 --> 01:28:49.908
Break loose, baby! Break loose!

01:28:49.985 --> 01:28:51.475
Here he goes! Get him!

01:28:57.192 --> 01:28:59.990
Hit him again!

01:29:06.468 --> 01:29:08.265
All right, Wayne!
Go ahead! Hit him!

01:29:18.112 --> 01:29:21.715
Kill him, Wayne! Don't let him up!

01:29:28.089 --> 01:29:30.283
Stop! Stop it! This is stupid!

01:29:30.357 --> 01:29:32.052
He'll kill you sooner or later.

01:29:32.125 --> 01:29:34.958
- I'm goin' with him. Come on, Frank.
- What?

01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:38.725
- No! No!
- It's not up to you!

01:29:38.799 --> 01:29:40.357
- Come on!
- No, you're not!

01:29:40.434 --> 01:29:43.562
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not! It's over.

01:29:43.637 --> 01:29:46.606
It's not over till he
says it's over, Wayne.

01:29:46.673 --> 01:29:50.438
- Come on, Frank.
- No. No.

01:29:50.509 --> 01:29:53.137
Now, come on, let's go.

01:29:55.714 --> 01:29:56.976
Shut up.

01:30:01.153 --> 01:30:03.212
Take her and choke on her.

01:30:03.289 --> 01:30:05.655
What?

01:30:05.724 --> 01:30:09.421
I wash my hands on both of ya. It'll
make my therapist very happy.

01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:18.266
The expediter of your dreams, pal.

01:30:23.541 --> 01:30:25.566
Kill that fuckin' cop.

01:30:27.579 --> 01:30:29.513
Frankie, what's the
matter with you?

01:30:29.581 --> 01:30:32.105
Come on, break it up,
for Christ's sake!

01:30:33.650 --> 01:30:35.242
That's enough!

01:30:44.895 --> 01:30:48.194
- What about accidents?
- You're the fuckin' accident.

01:30:48.265 --> 01:30:50.324
Do you see who I run with?

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:53.334
This is my life.

01:30:58.674 --> 01:31:01.700
- I lost a fuckin' tooth.
- Sorry.

01:31:04.013 --> 01:31:07.380
I thought we might wind up
bein' friends, me and you.

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:13.512
Let's go.

01:31:28.803 --> 01:31:31.293

- Yeah.

01:31:32.106 --> 01:31:34.040
Way to go, Mad Dog.

01:32:20.152 --> 01:32:21.585
What are you gonna do?

01:32:32.163 --> 01:32:35.189
Let's go home.

01:32:35.266 --> 01:32:36.665
