I did not do it.

We'll have plenty of time
to talk about this later.

09:58.902 --> 10:00.251
Right now,
we should focus

10:00.295 --> 10:01.688
on the clients we do have,
starting with

10:01.731 --> 10:03.385
the client
you brought in, Chunk.

Actually, Bull...

...she would prefer
that you sit this out.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.219
Sit this one out?

10:11.262 --> 10:13.003
She's concerned that
your legal troubles

10:13.047 --> 10:15.615
could create some liability
in her dad's case,

10:15.658 --> 10:17.007
and frankly, I agree.

10:17.878 --> 10:20.010
But this is my company.MARISSA: And if you don't

10:20.054 --> 10:21.272

taking a sabbatical.

Look, just until
your name is cleared.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.412

I agree.

to be sending over

10:58.135 --> 11:00.572

your case later this afternoon.

come back, we'll go over it?

Won't be necessary.

Your attorney?

11:07.275 --> 11:08.929
As soon as I find one.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.279
Is this because I asked you

11:11.322 --> 11:12.889
to step aside
for the Donaldson case?

11:12.933 --> 11:14.674
Was that you?
I thought it was the client.Yeah.

No, no, she did, but...

Well, it doesn't matter.

11:17.807 --> 11:19.809
Chunk, you were the attorney
on the class-action case

11:19.853 --> 11:21.724
where the bribe
that didn't happen happened.

11:21.768 --> 11:24.248
Yeah, I thought about that, but
I think we can easily sidestep

11:24.292 --> 11:25.423
any legal conflicts.

I'm a good enough attorney

11:38.698 --> 11:40.917
to represent him.That's not what he's saying.

11:40.961 --> 11:43.267
No, his words:
"I'm going with someone else."

We have to explain away
Lee's unpredictable behavior.

12:13.384 --> 12:14.951
Okay, what if
we frame it like this?

12:14.995 --> 12:16.300
Lee is not incompetent.

12:16.344 --> 12:17.867
He is an iconoclast.

12:17.911 --> 12:20.827
His unpredictable behavior
is due to his genius.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.916

So, Lee, the first thing

that we're gonna
need you to do is to take

12:42.283 --> 12:44.067
an independent
medical evaluation.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.329
What's that?

12:45.373 --> 12:46.722
It's a psych evaluation, Dad.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.419
I scheduled it
for later this afternoon.

Well, the other side
is claiming that you're

12:55.165 --> 12:57.472
not right in the head,
and to knock that down,

12:57.515 --> 13:01.084
we're going to need to bring in
the psychiatrist as a witness.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.130

defend that, sir?

13:47.130 --> 13:49.959
I would say this.

19:15.197 --> 19:17.939
A psychiatrist doing an IME.

19:17.982 --> 19:21.203
Hey, you can take the kid
out of the Bronx,

19:21.247 --> 19:24.032
but you cannot take the Bronx
out of the kid.

19:24.075 --> 19:25.686
Well, if you want
to win this case,

19:25.729 --> 19:29.211
perhaps you would consider
keeping the kid in Manhattan.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.560
[scoffs]

19:30.604 --> 19:32.214
Whatever you say.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.478
How mad is
Dr. Mosgrove?

19:35.522 --> 19:37.872
Mad enough
he's deeming Dad unstable.

19:37.915 --> 19:40.004
That IME gets sent
to the defense.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.876
They will use our witness
against us.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.443
We've lost
before we've even begun.

19:43.486 --> 19:45.140
No, no, no, no!

19:45.184 --> 19:46.924
I am not losing this case!

19:46.968 --> 19:50.232
No, not on my watch.

19:53.235 --> 19:55.237
Okay.

19:56.282 --> 19:59.285
The key to winning a wrongful
termination suit is proving

19:59.328 --> 20:01.722
that the company's
reason for termination

20:01.765 --> 20:03.463
was a pretext
for something else.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.029
They are saying
that they're doing this

20:05.073 --> 20:06.727
for the good of
20 Minute Oil & Lube,

20:06.770 --> 20:09.817
but maybe they're doing this
for the good of themselves.

20:09.860 --> 20:11.384
CHUNK:Exactly. We need
to get into

20:11.427 --> 20:13.734
the other side's motives and
find a way to impugn them.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.083
Investigate my sisters?

20:15.126 --> 20:16.476
I'll get Taylor on it.

20:16.519 --> 20:19.174
Oh, and maybe we leave
your dad out of this.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.917
I don't think he would react
well to this fishing expedition.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.266
Yeah.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.746
BEN:
We go on the offensive.

20:25.789 --> 20:27.051
This is the kind of game
where you don't wait

20:27.095 --> 20:28.357
for them
to show their hand.

20:28.401 --> 20:29.924
And we hit them
with character witnesses,

20:29.967 --> 20:31.273
even the ones
who don't like you.

20:31.317 --> 20:32.927
Are you saying there
are people out there

20:32.970 --> 20:34.624
who don't like me, Ben?[laughs]

20:34.668 --> 20:37.497
We aren't gonna earn sympathy
for what a great guy you are.

20:37.540 --> 20:40.282
We're going to earn respect
for what a great job you do.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.284
Integrity.
That's our word.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.112
We're going to buzz it
in the jury's ears

20:44.155 --> 20:45.809
until they think
it's a synonym for Bull.

20:45.853 --> 20:47.158
I like the way you're thinking.

20:48.334 --> 20:52.120
I hear that the AUSA
has footage of you outside

20:52.163 --> 20:53.513
of the juror's house.

20:53.556 --> 20:54.992
Yes, he does.

20:55.776 --> 20:57.125
Do you know if they have audio

20:57.168 --> 20:58.866
of you offering the juror
a bribe?

21:03.044 --> 21:06.917
I didn't offer the juror
a bribe, Ben.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.397
It doesn't matter.

21:08.441 --> 21:10.051
It's immaterial
to how I'll pursue my strategy.

21:10.094 --> 21:11.879
Well, it's material to me.

21:11.922 --> 21:16.492
If you think I have to bribe
a juror in order to win a case,

21:16.536 --> 21:18.712
you are not the man
for this job.

21:18.755 --> 21:20.714
Fine.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.324
Have fun falling on your sword.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.195
It's a beautiful sword
with the word "integrity"

21:24.239 --> 21:26.023
engraved on the side of it.

21:30.854 --> 21:33.117
Can I get you anything else?

21:33.161 --> 21:35.206
You know any good lawyers?

21:42.736 --> 21:44.694
Hey, have you found
anything we can use

21:44.738 --> 21:47.871
against Ruby or Gemma?There's very little on Ruby.

21:47.915 --> 21:49.786
Her life's blander
than this salad.

21:49.830 --> 21:52.180
No sign of
financial instability?

21:52.223 --> 21:53.573
Nope. She works
and goes home

21:53.616 --> 21:55.009
to her cats-- meow, snooze.

21:55.052 --> 21:56.053
And Gemma?

21:56.097 --> 21:57.272
There might be
something there.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.969
Gemma's iCalendar
would have us believe

21:59.013 --> 22:01.058
that she goes to the gym
every day at lunch,

22:01.102 --> 22:02.886
but her membership lapsed
six months ago.

22:02.930 --> 22:05.193
That could be a sign
of financial trouble.

22:05.236 --> 22:06.629
Where does she go?

22:06.673 --> 22:07.978
According to her
cell phone location data,

22:08.022 --> 22:09.284
she spends her lunch hours

22:09.328 --> 22:11.242
at The Triple Ivy Club.

22:11.286 --> 22:13.070
Oh. A Triple Ivy Club
membership is

22:13.114 --> 22:15.334
way more expensive
than any gym.

22:15.377 --> 22:16.683
That's the thing, though.

22:16.726 --> 22:18.380
Neither she nor her husband
is a member.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.208
So, what do you think she's been

22:20.251 --> 22:22.253
doing there every day?No idea.

22:22.297 --> 22:24.386
Yeah, but you're gonna go
and get an idea, right?

22:24.430 --> 22:25.953
That club is harder to get into

22:25.996 --> 22:27.302
than skinny jeans
in a heat wave.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.521
Well, hack into the system.

22:28.564 --> 22:30.087
Make yourself
a member for a day.

22:30.131 --> 22:31.567
[scoffs] I try not
to sign my name

22:31.611 --> 22:33.613
when I hack
someone's system.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.180
There is... [sighs]

22:36.224 --> 22:38.095
one person I could call
to get me in.

22:38.139 --> 22:40.402
I just really don't want to.

22:40.446 --> 22:41.621
Here you go.

22:42.578 --> 22:44.145
Thanks again
for getting me in here.

22:44.188 --> 22:45.755
No problem.

22:45.799 --> 22:48.149
How come you never took me here
when we were married?

22:48.192 --> 22:49.411
Because you thought
private clubs

22:49.455 --> 22:51.065
were elitist and disgusting.

22:51.108 --> 22:52.762
I still do, but, Erik,

22:52.806 --> 22:54.677
look at this view.

22:54.721 --> 22:56.287
Yeah.

22:56.331 --> 22:58.072
It's something.

22:58.725 --> 23:00.335
TAYLOR:
Yes! There she is.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.989
Don't look.
You'll blow my cover.

23:02.032 --> 23:03.382
Your cover?

23:03.425 --> 23:05.949
I told you,
I'm on a stakeout for work.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.298
I thought you were kidding.

23:07.342 --> 23:08.604
Aren't stakeouts Danny's thing?

23:08.648 --> 23:11.433
Her mom is sick.
I'm doing double duty.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.566
[gasps] Hello.

23:13.609 --> 23:15.959
Someone's getting cozy with
someone who's not her husband.

23:16.003 --> 23:18.571
Here, scooch in.
Let's take a selfie.

23:22.009 --> 23:23.358
[camera beeps, clicks]

23:24.272 --> 23:25.665
[camera beeps, clicks]

23:25.708 --> 23:29.016
Oh, my gosh, this is great.

23:29.799 --> 23:31.105
[camera beeps, clicks]

23:31.888 --> 23:33.455
I have to go.
What?

23:33.499 --> 23:34.978
Uh, you can order
whatever you want.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.763
Just tell them to
charge it to my tab.

23:36.806 --> 23:38.808
Erik, what did I do?

23:38.852 --> 23:40.506
Nothing. It's my mistake.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.682
I just thought
this whole stakeout thing

23:42.725 --> 23:44.466
was an excuse to see me.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.947
I thought you might regret
calling things off.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.818
Oh, Erik, I'm really sorry. I...

23:48.862 --> 23:50.603
Like I said, my mistake.

23:50.646 --> 23:52.648
But can you
do me a favor?

23:52.692 --> 23:54.171
Yes, anything.

23:54.215 --> 23:56.260
Unless you want to
talk about our son,

23:56.304 --> 23:57.697
don't call me.

23:57.740 --> 24:00.569
Don't ask to see me.
I'm not your friend, okay?

24:05.531 --> 24:07.184
BULL:
Come on, baby, move your feet,

24:07.228 --> 24:09.056
or you're gonna
be kissing canvas.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.451
I assume this lazy-day thing
you've got going

24:12.494 --> 24:14.278
means you found a lawyer?

24:14.322 --> 24:17.847
Uh, what is it
Shakespeare said?

24:17.891 --> 24:21.808
"First thing we do,
kill all the lawyers"?

24:21.851 --> 24:23.723
[chuckles]

24:25.594 --> 24:28.118
No. Hmm-mm.
I'm not doing this.

24:28.162 --> 24:29.685
If you were
the only one affected,

24:29.729 --> 24:31.687
I'd let you wallow
to your heart's content,

24:31.731 --> 24:33.036
but it's not just you.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.516
It's me. It's Astrid.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.865
It's us.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.432
It turns out it's

24:37.476 --> 24:39.739
a lot harder to find
a good lawyer than you'd think.

24:40.566 --> 24:43.438
Jason, it's time for you
to go out there

24:43.482 --> 24:45.396
and find someone
who kicked your ass in court

24:45.440 --> 24:46.702
and ask them to help you,

24:46.746 --> 24:48.443
because if you don't,
the only fights

24:48.487 --> 24:50.314
you're gonna be watching
are gonna be on the prison yard.

24:50.358 --> 24:52.186
That's a good speech.

24:52.229 --> 24:54.405
You know,
don't make me give it again,

24:54.449 --> 24:56.756
because next time,
it might be too late.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.323
Okay?

25:00.107 --> 25:01.456
Okay.

25:05.242 --> 25:07.070
[sighs]

25:07.114 --> 25:08.768
CHUNK:
So, Mr. Corso,

25:08.811 --> 25:11.292
can you tell us how long
you've known Mr. Donaldson?

25:11.335 --> 25:12.728
Over 30 years.

25:12.772 --> 25:14.817
I'm employee number two.

25:14.861 --> 25:18.429
And how would you describe
Mr. Donaldson's business acumen?

25:18.473 --> 25:21.302
Lee's a genius,
plain and simple.

25:21.345 --> 25:23.783
Especially when it comes
to marketing.

25:23.826 --> 25:26.089
CHUNK:
Can you give us an example?

25:26.133 --> 25:27.438
Well, he came up with that

25:27.482 --> 25:29.919
♪ We'll keep you fluid
tagline himself.

25:29.963 --> 25:31.268
[Corso laughs]

25:31.312 --> 25:32.574
It's catchy, huh?It sure is.

25:32.618 --> 25:35.272
Mr. Corso, have you noticed
any decline

25:35.316 --> 25:37.797
in Mr. Donaldson's abilities
recently?

25:37.840 --> 25:39.189
Absolutely not.

25:39.233 --> 25:41.757
In fact,
he's only getting sharper.

25:41.801 --> 25:44.934
And say what you will
about his jaunt in the fountain,

25:44.978 --> 25:49.548
but it's already become a meme
seen by over a million people.

25:49.591 --> 25:52.289
If that's not marketing
brilliance, what is?

25:52.333 --> 25:53.595
Indeed.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.118
No further questions,
Your Honor.

25:55.162 --> 25:56.903
How does it look?

25:56.946 --> 25:59.601
He spun one of our worst facts
into gold, so I'm thinking

25:59.645 --> 26:01.211
there's a "greener
than a leprechaun" joke

26:01.255 --> 26:04.040
to be made here,
but I'll leave those to you.

26:04.824 --> 26:07.740
I have only one question,
Mr. Corso.

26:07.783 --> 26:11.308
Can you explain the $2 million
line item on the budget

26:11.352 --> 26:13.702
for research and development?

26:17.837 --> 26:19.839
It's...

26:19.882 --> 26:22.537
for research and, um,
development.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.931
Could you be more specific?

26:29.283 --> 26:30.545
What's he getting at?

26:31.372 --> 26:32.808
JEFF:
Mr. Corso?

26:32.852 --> 26:34.723
JUDGE STERN:
I will direct the witness

26:34.767 --> 26:37.204
to answer
the defense's question.

26:39.249 --> 26:41.687
It's for a shaman.

[jurors murmuring]JEFF: Sh-Shaman?

26:43.384 --> 26:46.213
As in guru, as in healer?

26:46.256 --> 26:49.608
Lee hired him to consult on
our overall corporate strategy.

26:49.651 --> 26:52.654
And did Mr. Donaldson
instruct you to camouflage

26:52.698 --> 26:55.570
the $2 million payment
to the shaman

26:55.614 --> 26:56.832
as research and development?

26:56.876 --> 26:58.704
No. I did that on my own.

26:59.574 --> 27:01.620
Because you thought
it looked crazy.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.231
Isn't that right?

27:05.580 --> 27:07.930
Should I even ask?

27:09.889 --> 27:11.412
Best if you didn't.

27:12.848 --> 27:14.850
Didn't he say
he was staying away?

to be happy to see me.

on happiness right now, Bull.

OLIVIA:
Detective, I'm gonna stop
asking you questions

27:36.655 --> 27:39.135

your stammering obfuscation

to these proceedings.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.270

a reason
to investigate my client

27:46.752 --> 27:48.231

political vendetta.

28:40.501 --> 28:41.763
Come one, that was 12 years ago.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.286
The world had a sense of humor.

28:43.330 --> 28:44.853
I loathe parlor tricks.

28:44.897 --> 28:46.681
You didn't play
by the rules back then,

28:46.725 --> 28:49.118
and you're in hot water
for doing the same thing now.

28:49.162 --> 28:51.077
I didn't bribe that juror.

28:51.120 --> 28:52.774
Goodbye, Jason.Wait.

28:52.818 --> 28:53.688
Come on.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.734
You still won that case.

28:55.777 --> 28:57.605
What are you
so angry about?

28:57.648 --> 28:59.738
I'm not angry, Jason.
I'm tired.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.827
People like you,
who rig the game,

29:01.870 --> 29:04.830
put their thumb on the scales,
you make me tired.

29:04.873 --> 29:07.528
You're not on the level,
and that exhausts me.

29:07.571 --> 29:09.791
I didn't rig anything.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.662
Well, then you
and whatever lawyer

29:11.706 --> 29:13.708
you can con
into representing you

29:13.752 --> 29:15.797
should have nothing
to worry about.

29:25.851 --> 29:28.723
Your father spent
$2 million on a shaman?

29:28.767 --> 29:30.333
Kitt buries bodies
for my dad.

29:30.377 --> 29:31.944
Gemma and Ruby
must've dug them up.

29:31.987 --> 29:34.947
That shaman just made our
iconoclast look like a nutjob.

29:34.990 --> 29:38.211
Maybe I just love him too much
to admit that he's declining.

29:38.254 --> 29:40.126
I've always put my dad
on a pedestal.

29:40.169 --> 29:42.693
I guess I just
put him up too high.

29:42.737 --> 29:44.391
We still have
one more play to make.

29:44.434 --> 29:45.479
Taylor.

29:45.522 --> 29:47.568
Gemma's been having
daily lunches

29:47.611 --> 29:49.788
with a man named
Rocco Bird.

29:50.397 --> 29:52.355
The CEO of
Rocco's Auto Center?

29:52.399 --> 29:53.356
You know him?

29:53.400 --> 29:55.010
My dad told us Rocco made

29:55.054 --> 29:57.186
a buyout offer six months ago,
but he turned him down flat.

29:57.230 --> 29:59.406
By the looks of it,
Rocco's trying to go

29:59.449 --> 30:01.016
through door number two.

30:01.060 --> 30:03.236
If I were a gambler,
I would wager

30:03.279 --> 30:05.412
that Gemma is mixing
business with pleasure

30:05.455 --> 30:09.416
and has a handshake deal to
sell 20 Minute Oil & Lube

30:09.459 --> 30:11.592
to Rocco once the
case is over.

30:11.635 --> 30:13.333
Or is that too
big of a leap?

30:13.376 --> 30:15.683
No. We can make
that leap in court

30:15.726 --> 30:17.641
and hope that we stick
the landing.

30:18.468 --> 30:20.035
So you're calling Gemma
to the stand?

30:20.079 --> 30:21.341
No.

30:21.384 --> 30:23.038
I have something else in mind.

30:23.082 --> 30:25.649
CHUNK:Thank you for joining us
here today, Ms. Donaldson.

30:25.693 --> 30:28.652
You were the one
that orchestrated the plot

30:28.696 --> 30:30.872
to oust your father from
the company that he started.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.178
Isn't that right?

30:32.221 --> 30:33.788
RUBY:
Um, I wouldn't characterize it

30:33.832 --> 30:37.836
as orchestrating anything,
but I voted with the board.

30:37.879 --> 30:40.360
Do you know the succession plan
for 20 Minute Oil & Lube

30:40.403 --> 30:41.970
should you prevail here?

30:42.014 --> 30:46.279
Yes. My sister Gemma and I
will run the company together.

30:46.322 --> 30:48.629
So you'll share
responsibilities 50-50?

30:48.672 --> 30:49.978
Yes.

30:50.022 --> 30:52.459
Because-- and-and I-I mean
no disrespect--

30:52.502 --> 30:54.765
but wouldn't you agree
that Gemma

30:54.809 --> 30:58.465
is a much more take-charge
kind of person than you are?

30:58.508 --> 31:00.293
More like your father
in that way?

31:00.336 --> 31:02.556
I guess so. Yes.

31:02.599 --> 31:04.645
But Gemma and I consult
with each other

31:04.688 --> 31:06.429
before every major decision.

31:06.473 --> 31:07.778
Well, did she
consult with you

31:07.822 --> 31:09.998
before having an affair
with Rocco Bird,

31:10.042 --> 31:12.871
the CEO of Rocco's Auto Center?

31:12.914 --> 31:14.002
What?JEFF: Objection.

31:14.046 --> 31:15.656
Lacks foundation.

31:15.699 --> 31:18.746
Sustained.
Move on, Mr. Palmer.

31:19.703 --> 31:22.837
Do you think that you'll still
share 50-50 control

31:22.881 --> 31:25.318
when she sells
20 Minute Oil & Lube

31:25.361 --> 31:28.016
to Rocco's Auto Center
right out from under you?

31:28.060 --> 31:29.452
Objection, Your Honor.

31:29.496 --> 31:30.801
Are you having an affair?

31:30.845 --> 31:33.935
Were you planning
to sell the company?

31:33.979 --> 31:35.981
No. Of course not.

31:36.024 --> 31:38.026
Oh, my God, you're lying.

31:38.070 --> 31:41.377
You always play with your hair
when you're lying!

31:41.421 --> 31:43.379
Order in the court.Stop!

31:45.947 --> 31:47.383
This isn't what I wanted,

31:47.427 --> 31:49.472
my daughters turning
against each other.

31:50.212 --> 31:54.086
Mr. Donaldson, Mr. Donaldson,
where are you going?

31:54.129 --> 31:55.522
I'm done.

31:55.565 --> 31:57.045
Mr. Donaldson,
you can't just walk out

31:57.089 --> 31:58.177
in the middle of testimony.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.048
Oh, really?

32:00.092 --> 32:01.832
Watch me.

32:03.095 --> 32:04.574
[door opens]

32:06.750 --> 32:08.883
[door closes]

32:08.927 --> 32:10.493
TAYLOR [over phone]:
I'm guessing that you're

32:10.537 --> 32:12.495
checking in on the case.I am.

32:12.539 --> 32:13.888
Even though you said
you wouldn't.

32:13.932 --> 32:14.802
Taylor.

32:14.845 --> 32:16.717
Well, your timing is uncanny.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.762
Lee had an outburst
and stormed out of court.

32:18.806 --> 32:20.808
Ah. Something tells me
that didn't play well

32:20.851 --> 32:22.636
with Judge Stern.TAYLOR: Chunk was barely able

32:22.679 --> 32:24.203
to convince her
to grant a continuance,

32:24.246 --> 32:26.857
and if we can't get Lee
back in court by end of day...

32:26.901 --> 32:29.121
She'll throw out the case,
and Lee will lose everything.

32:29.164 --> 32:31.079
Any idea where he went?TAYLOR: No one knows.

32:31.123 --> 32:33.647
I'm guessing he had
a worse day than you.

32:35.562 --> 32:38.391
Taylor, I got to go.

32:40.393 --> 32:42.612
♪

32:47.748 --> 32:48.923

32:50.359 --> 32:51.839
Join me?

32:54.450 --> 32:57.236
[sighs heavily]

32:57.279 --> 33:00.674
Dr. Jason Bull.

33:02.023 --> 33:03.590
Mr. Lee Donaldson.

33:03.633 --> 33:05.331
Thought I'd find you down here.

33:05.374 --> 33:06.985
Bad day, huh?

33:07.028 --> 33:09.074
Hasn't been the best.

33:09.117 --> 33:10.597
Yeah.

33:16.211 --> 33:18.822
Lee, I believe-- whoo!--

33:18.866 --> 33:22.304
you and I are
very much alike.

33:22.348 --> 33:24.785
And how's that?Well...

33:27.222 --> 33:30.660
We've both been thrown out
of the businesses we started.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.838
Our families doubt our sanity.Mm-hmm.

33:34.882 --> 33:39.669
We're wading in water,
talking to the wind

33:39.713 --> 33:42.020
like a couple of King Lears.

33:43.325 --> 33:46.024
We're men
who've lost our crowns.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.114
I thought I was strange,

33:49.157 --> 33:52.508
but you might be even stranger.

33:52.552 --> 33:54.989
I'm just trying
to keep my life together.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.556
What's your excuse, Lee?

33:56.599 --> 33:58.340
I have my reasons.

33:58.384 --> 34:00.734
I'm sure you do.

34:00.777 --> 34:04.346
You know, s-sometimes
I lose my temper,

34:04.390 --> 34:07.175
like with that damn psychiatrist

34:07.219 --> 34:10.004
or today in court-- see?--

34:10.048 --> 34:12.093
but that doesn't mean

34:12.137 --> 34:15.357
that I don't know
what's best for my family.

34:15.401 --> 34:16.967
Don't you mean your business?

34:17.011 --> 34:18.665
Isn't that
what this is all about?

34:18.708 --> 34:21.711
They're one and the same.

34:23.452 --> 34:25.019
Put out your hand.

34:26.586 --> 34:28.805
[coins jingling]Here.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.374
What do you wish for?

34:32.418 --> 34:34.420
[chuckles]

34:36.944 --> 34:39.294
Uh...

34:39.338 --> 34:41.644
to go back to the beginning.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.734
To start clean.

34:45.692 --> 34:48.086
Just me and my girls

34:48.129 --> 34:50.218
and my little garage,

34:50.262 --> 34:52.873
changing filters...

34:54.744 --> 34:58.618
...wiping grease from
their foreheads.

35:08.932 --> 35:11.935
I may not know how
to solve my problems, Lee,

35:11.979 --> 35:14.590
but I believe I know
how to solve yours.

35:24.296 --> 35:27.037
Is this you still not
checking up on us?

35:27.081 --> 35:28.778
Oh, I'm... I'm not here.

35:28.822 --> 35:31.564
I'm staying away
from the case, as promised.

35:31.607 --> 35:34.610
But if I were here,
I would put Lee on the stand,

35:34.654 --> 35:37.657
and I would only ask him
one question.

35:39.006 --> 35:40.790
Even if I thought
it was a good idea

35:40.834 --> 35:44.229
to put Lee on the stand--
which I don't--

35:44.272 --> 35:46.666
I couldn't,
because Lee's not here.

35:46.709 --> 35:48.494
Actually, Lee is here.

35:51.845 --> 35:54.282
I'm sorry I went Bronx
on you again, Mr. Palmer.

35:54.326 --> 35:56.763
Please stick with me.

35:56.806 --> 35:58.634
I promise you I'll...

35:58.678 --> 36:01.550
I'll stay in Manhattan
for the rest of the deal.

36:03.900 --> 36:05.772
[sighs]

36:06.816 --> 36:11.386
I-I'd take the risk,
but again, I'm not here.

36:15.738 --> 36:17.262
CHUNK: Mr. Donaldson.LEE: Hmm?

36:17.305 --> 36:19.655
I'm going to read to you
five words,

36:19.699 --> 36:21.353
and if you would,
I'd like for you to recite them

36:21.396 --> 36:23.093
in the order
in which I read them to you.

36:23.137 --> 36:25.879
Plant. Book.

36:25.922 --> 36:27.794
Dog. Flute.

36:27.837 --> 36:28.969
Shoe.

36:29.012 --> 36:31.232
Plant. Book.

36:31.276 --> 36:34.192
Dog. Flute.

36:34.235 --> 36:36.019
Shoe. How'd I do?

36:36.063 --> 36:37.978
Perfect. [chuckles]

36:38.021 --> 36:42.765
Do you remember the color suit
you wore to your wedding?

36:42.809 --> 36:43.897
Which wedding?

36:43.940 --> 36:45.855
[laughter]

36:45.899 --> 36:48.858
When I married Gemma
and Ruby's dear mother--

36:48.902 --> 36:51.905
may she rest in peace--

36:51.948 --> 36:54.212
I didn't have a pot to...

36:55.300 --> 36:57.258
I was broke,

36:57.302 --> 37:01.567
so I wore
hand-me-down gray slacks

37:01.610 --> 37:05.223
and a white button-down
my Uncle Mike gave me.

37:06.311 --> 37:10.228
And when I married
Kira's mother--

37:10.271 --> 37:12.752
may she also rest in peace--

37:12.795 --> 37:15.058
I wore a black tuxedo.

37:15.102 --> 37:16.756
[chuckles] With tails.

37:17.583 --> 37:20.063
I have one last question
for you, Mr. Donaldson.

37:20.107 --> 37:23.763
Which one of your daughters

37:23.806 --> 37:25.591
do you love the most?

37:26.766 --> 37:27.854
[murmuring]

37:32.293 --> 37:36.166
I love my daughters
all the same.

37:36.210 --> 37:40.910
When you get older, you realize
the mistakes that you made.

37:40.954 --> 37:45.437
I gave my daughters too much
of the wrong things

37:45.480 --> 37:48.353
and not enough
of the right things.

37:48.396 --> 37:51.269
I gave them money, privilege.

37:51.312 --> 37:55.751
I gave them everything that
I never had when I was a kid.

37:55.795 --> 38:00.843
But I didn't teach them
how to love each other.

38:06.327 --> 38:08.198
I'm sorry.

38:10.636 --> 38:14.422
Mr. Donaldson,
why did you jump naked

38:14.466 --> 38:15.771
into that fountain,

38:15.815 --> 38:18.600
invest so heavily
in cryptocurrency?

38:18.644 --> 38:24.432
Why would you give half-off
oil changes on your busiest day?

38:24.476 --> 38:28.741
I've been trying
to devalue my company.

38:28.784 --> 38:30.525
CHUNK: Devalue?[gallery murmuring]

38:30.569 --> 38:32.701
How?Six months back,

38:32.745 --> 38:37.793
I got an offer to sell my
company to Rocco's Auto Center.

38:37.837 --> 38:39.882
And when I told
my daughters about it,

38:39.926 --> 38:42.015
I could see that
they were getting ready

38:42.058 --> 38:44.887
to fight over all that money.

38:44.931 --> 38:48.108
I knew I had to do
something drastic.

38:48.151 --> 38:53.331
Are you telling us that you have
intentionally attempted to...

38:53.374 --> 38:55.376
to bankrupt
20 Minute Oil & Lube?

38:55.420 --> 38:59.989
If I devalued
the company to nothing...

39:01.208 --> 39:05.647
...we'd all have to go back
to the beginning together,

39:05.691 --> 39:09.912
where all we had was pennies...

39:09.956 --> 39:12.001
and wishes.

39:12.872 --> 39:18.225
I love my daughters
with every fiber of my being.

39:20.619 --> 39:24.536
And I just want them
to love each other as much.

39:39.812 --> 39:42.815
Am I supposed to pretend
you're not here again?

39:42.858 --> 39:44.860
No. This is me.

39:44.904 --> 39:46.296
How's it going in there?

39:46.340 --> 39:48.908
Chunk is trying a little
family mediation after all.

39:48.951 --> 39:50.083
Mm.

39:50.126 --> 39:51.345
You and I could use a little

39:51.389 --> 39:52.694
family mediation,
don't you think?

39:52.738 --> 39:54.261
Bull.

39:54.304 --> 39:57.090
I owe you an apology.
I know that.

39:57.133 --> 39:58.787
And, in fact, I was

39:58.831 --> 40:00.659
in the middle of one
when I got arrested.

40:00.702 --> 40:03.009
There will be time for
you and me to hash this out,

40:03.052 --> 40:05.751
but right now, the one
you need to talk to is Chunk.

40:06.708 --> 40:09.537
Well, I am glad that we could
come to an agreement.

40:09.581 --> 40:12.148
Look, I really appreciate
you sticking with me.

40:12.192 --> 40:16.457
I'm sorry about all
that I put you through.

40:16.501 --> 40:18.546
Free oil filters for life?

40:18.590 --> 40:21.070
Mr. Donaldson,
if only I had a car.

40:21.114 --> 40:23.421
[chuckles] Okay.

40:25.510 --> 40:27.729
[quiet chatter]

40:35.607 --> 40:39.045
Well, Mr. Palmer, I see smiles.
That's good.

40:39.088 --> 40:40.612
We worked out a deal.

40:40.655 --> 40:42.744
Lee's gonna turn over control
of the company

40:42.788 --> 40:45.443
to all three of his daughters,
with one condition:

40:45.486 --> 40:47.532
that they all three
run it together

40:47.575 --> 40:49.795
for the next ten years
before they sell it.

40:49.838 --> 40:51.013
That's clever.

40:51.057 --> 40:52.362
You were right putting Lee
on the stand.

40:52.406 --> 40:53.755
And that question...

40:53.799 --> 40:55.453
I think you would've
come up with something.

40:55.496 --> 40:57.455
No matter what,
you were gonna win this thing.

40:57.498 --> 40:58.717
You don't have to do that, Bull.

40:58.760 --> 41:01.937
If our pal Lee
has taught us one thing,

41:01.981 --> 41:05.463
it's to speak your truth
before everything falls apart.

41:05.506 --> 41:07.987
So I'll speak mine.

41:08.030 --> 41:10.729
You're a great lawyer
and a great friend.

41:10.772 --> 41:13.514
And friends have
blind spots.

41:13.558 --> 41:15.690
They protect each other
unknowingly.

41:15.734 --> 41:17.475
I can't risk that
right now.

41:17.518 --> 41:19.477
I need someone
who doesn't care about me,

41:19.520 --> 41:21.217
who only cares about the law.

41:21.261 --> 41:22.436
Think you found that person?

41:22.480 --> 41:24.482
I think I have.

41:24.525 --> 41:26.396
If she'll have me.

41:29.356 --> 41:31.314
I don't mock the system.[sighs]

41:31.358 --> 41:33.316
It's been a long day.I test the system.

41:33.360 --> 41:35.275
And I didn't cross a line
when we met,

41:35.318 --> 41:37.146
and I didn't
cross one now.

41:37.190 --> 41:39.366
Look, that juror
got paid, Jason.

41:39.409 --> 41:41.281
Not by me.

41:41.324 --> 41:42.674
And yes, someone got
to that juror.

41:42.717 --> 41:44.197
Somebody rigged the game,

41:44.240 --> 41:46.068
somebody put their thumb
on the scales, but it wasn't me.

41:46.112 --> 41:47.940
I care about the system,
I revere the system,

41:47.983 --> 41:50.203
and if you cared about it
as much as you say,

41:50.246 --> 41:51.639
you would do something about it.

41:51.683 --> 41:53.423
Because I intend to.

41:54.207 --> 41:55.904
You finished?

41:55.948 --> 41:58.516
[sighs] Yes.

41:59.908 --> 42:02.041
Thank you for hearing me out.

42:03.216 --> 42:05.087
I'll see you around.

42:05.131 --> 42:06.872
No.

42:09.265 --> 42:10.266
[sighs]

42:10.310 --> 42:11.920
Actually, I'll see you tomorrow.

42:11.964 --> 42:13.400
What?

42:13.443 --> 42:15.837
9:00 a.m., sharp.

42:17.273 --> 42:18.753
We got a big fight ahead of us.
