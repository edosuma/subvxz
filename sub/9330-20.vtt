WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:04.129
Man, I think breaking up
with Sam hurt the most.

00:04.129 --> 00:05.756
We liked her.

00:05.756 --> 00:07.716
We all really liked her.

00:07.716 --> 00:08.884
But that's it.

00:08.884 --> 00:11.261
No more chasing,
no more dating, no more‐‐

00:15.766 --> 00:17.726
What was I talking about?

00:17.726 --> 00:19.520
‐Women.
‐Yeah. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, that.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.063
No more chasing women.

00:21.063 --> 00:23.357
From this moment on,
it's just gonna be about Emma.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.608
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:24.608 --> 00:26.526
Okay, okay, I see
what you're doing.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.987
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're saying
you're done looking,

00:28.987 --> 00:32.282
but you know good and well
that the minute you do, bam!

00:32.282 --> 00:34.785
The universe is
finally gonna give
you the perfect girl.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.370
Uh, no, I don't think
that's how the universe‐‐

00:36.370 --> 00:37.871
‐Oh, my God!
‐Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry!

00:37.871 --> 00:39.581
No, no, no, wait, wait.
It was totally my fault.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.041
No, I wasn't looking.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.584
Neither was I.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.218
Oh, you're good.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.636
Oh, you are very good.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.181
‐Stop it.
‐What?

00:56.181 --> 00:57.266
(theme music playing)

00:57.266 --> 01:00.394
<i>♪ It's amazing</i>
<i>how the unexpected ♪</i>

01:00.394 --> 01:03.563
<i>♪ Can take your life</i>
<i>and change directions ♪</i>

01:07.609 --> 01:11.238
Oh, you're a lucky girl, Emma.

01:11.238 --> 01:14.199
Nobody ever gave me pony rides
when I was a kid.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.703
You were five feet tall
when you were 10, Danny.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.082
You were always
gonna be the pony.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.252
Breaking news, people.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.337
The Bar on B is
the official beer sponsor

01:27.337 --> 01:29.047
for the neighborhood
street fair this Sunday.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.258
We are gonna make bank!

01:31.258 --> 01:32.926
And by "we,"
I mean you people,

01:32.926 --> 01:34.678
because I totally forgot
and didn't hire any help

01:34.678 --> 01:36.805
to run the booth.
Great, thanks, love you guys.

01:36.805 --> 01:37.931
No can do.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.725
I already made plans
to spend the day

01:39.725 --> 01:42.686
at an adorable
little girl's birthday party.

01:42.686 --> 01:43.812
Whose?

01:43.812 --> 01:45.188
Here's a hint.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.191
Emma?

01:48.191 --> 01:49.318
Emma's!

01:49.318 --> 01:51.486
It's her birthday?
It's her birthday!

01:51.486 --> 01:53.488
I knew that!
No, I didn't. Dammit!

01:54.865 --> 01:56.033
I remembered.

01:56.033 --> 01:59.036
I got Emma her first pair
of S‐K‐A‐T‐E‐S,

01:59.036 --> 02:01.079
and a ton of E‐Q‐U...

02:01.079 --> 02:03.290
stuff to go with it.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.624
You know what? It's cool.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.460
I'll just tell the street fair
people that I'm out,

02:06.460 --> 02:09.421
and I'll start planning you
an amazing birthday party.

02:09.421 --> 02:11.381
Mom, do you have any ideas?

02:11.381 --> 02:13.091
Mine are to use
whatever ideas you have.

02:14.343 --> 02:16.386
Benjamin Bon Jovi Wheeler.

02:16.386 --> 02:17.638
This is your child.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.306
I expected more from you.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.683
‐Did you?
‐No.

02:21.683 --> 02:25.228
(sultry ringtone playing)

02:25.228 --> 02:26.438
It's Brad.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.570
(flirtatiously)
Hello, lover.

02:34.696 --> 02:35.906
What?

02:35.906 --> 02:37.741
You're finally coming home?

02:37.741 --> 02:39.743
Oh, my God! Today?

02:39.743 --> 02:41.286
Oh, God. Okay.
I gotta go.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.163
Oh, God, there's so much
to wax! Oh, God!

02:43.163 --> 02:44.831
Mom, wait, wait, wait!

02:44.831 --> 02:46.166
What about the party?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.501
Oh, why do you think
I'm leaving?

02:47.501 --> 02:50.504
I know where the party is,
and it ain't here.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.381
The party is in my...

02:52.381 --> 02:53.840
Bye, sweetie!
Grandma loves you!

02:59.012 --> 03:02.641
Danny, dude, I just got
the most amazing news.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.768
I got an offer to play
for the Vancouver Canucks.

03:04.768 --> 03:07.020
That was not my news.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.939
I just don't know
what I should do.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.774
They're offering to pay me
almost twice as much

03:10.774 --> 03:12.317
as I'm making
for the Rangers,

03:12.317 --> 03:14.820
but Riley and I are finally
in a really good place

03:14.820 --> 03:15.946
and I don't know
if moving is

03:15.946 --> 03:17.656
the right thing
for us right now.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.241
Dude, look,
you need to start

03:19.241 --> 03:21.201
thinking a little less
about "us"

03:21.201 --> 03:22.911
and a little more
about "you."

03:22.911 --> 03:25.372
Oh, Tucker.
I'm sorry, man.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.416
I was talking
about me and Riley.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.334
No, man. No.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.336
Take the job, dude. Okay?

03:31.336 --> 03:33.505
Riley will follow you anywhere.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.799
She loves you
and she'll be there for you.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.676
Especially after everything
you've done for her.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.302
You're right.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.595
Thanks for the advice, man.

03:40.595 --> 03:41.763
Hey, what was your news?

03:41.763 --> 03:43.223
‐Oh, well‐‐
‐Riley: Knock, knock. Danny?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.307
Oh, yeah, out here.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.520
Oh, no bigs, man.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.148
Yeah, I'm just in the running
to become the new on‐air talent

03:51.148 --> 03:54.025
for an entertainment show
in LA. It's my total dream job.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.778
I'm just‐‐ just waiting
for that call, you know?

03:56.778 --> 03:58.738
(imitates Danny)
Oh, wow, bro. Congratulations!

03:58.738 --> 04:00.490
That's amazing!

04:00.490 --> 04:01.741
(as himself)
Oh, thanks, man.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.493
You are a great friend.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.459
Just the girl
I wanted to talk to.

04:10.459 --> 04:11.710
I've got some pretty big news.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.378
Oh, my God,
so do I.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.130
I have so much to tell you.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.340
First, I just found out
I'm on the short list

04:17.340 --> 04:18.467
to make junior partner.

04:18.467 --> 04:20.469
Talk about destroying the odds
in the office pool.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.471
Oh, congratulations!

04:22.471 --> 04:24.264
‐Thank you.
‐I'm so proud of you!

04:24.264 --> 04:28.393
And I got
a pretty amazing offer
to play for Vancouver.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.895
Vancouver.

04:29.895 --> 04:32.564
But I should probably
just turn it down now,

04:32.564 --> 04:34.399
you know, with
your news and all.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.861
Really? Oh.
Oh, my God.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.613
Junior partner.
Can you believe it?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.281
That's so crazy, right?

04:41.281 --> 04:42.741
‐But that's not all‐‐
‐Wait, that's it?

04:42.741 --> 04:45.494
Not even a second to consider
my job or my career?

04:45.494 --> 04:47.287
Well, you just said‐‐

04:47.287 --> 04:49.039
I've been agonizing
over this for days,

04:49.039 --> 04:50.791
trying to figure out
what's the best for us.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.918
You know, you and me
together as a team.

04:52.918 --> 04:56.338
But apparently it's just like
it always has been‐‐

04:56.338 --> 04:59.549
me thinking about you
and you thinking about you.

05:01.343 --> 05:03.470
We'll talk about it tonight.
I'll see you later.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.471
Oh, no‐‐

05:09.935 --> 05:11.812
Hey, sorry I'm late,
but those stupid

05:11.812 --> 05:13.522
street fair people
won't let me back out

05:13.522 --> 05:15.607
because I signed
a binding contract.

05:15.607 --> 05:17.400
They're gonna sue me
for everything I'm worth.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.903
Well, joke's on them
'cause I got nothin'.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.739
Well, I got somethin'.
Directions home. Get out.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.324
Brad's gonna be here
any minute.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.742
No, Mom, come on.
You have to help me out.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.285
I invited a bunch
of Emma's friends

05:27.285 --> 05:29.162
and their parents over
for a party tomorrow night.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.081
I also promised punch and pie,

05:31.081 --> 05:33.124
so if you can get started
on that, that'd be great.

05:33.124 --> 05:34.626
‐(knock on door)
‐(squeals)

05:34.626 --> 05:35.752
Yeah, that's not happening.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.003
(chuckles)

05:40.382 --> 05:41.424
Brad!

05:41.424 --> 05:42.634
Bon‐Bon!

05:43.760 --> 05:46.054
(chuckles)

05:46.054 --> 05:48.181
Let's try that again, okay?

05:48.181 --> 05:50.600
‐Brad!
‐Bon‐Bon!

05:51.601 --> 05:53.478
Nope. Still the same.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.438
Bonnie, it's me,

05:55.438 --> 05:58.567
free of society's
superficial bonds.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.485
Oh, yeah.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.945
Yeah, I‐‐ I know, sweetie,

06:01.945 --> 06:05.198
but society also frowns
on smelling like an onion.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.741
Wow.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.160
Well, we'd love to stay
and catch something,
but we gotta go.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.245
Oh, no, no, no.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.664
What I look like
doesn't matter, does it?

06:12.664 --> 06:14.124
Of course it does.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.166
You think you got this far

06:15.166 --> 06:17.544
in your career
by being talented?

06:17.544 --> 06:21.506
Look, Bonnie,
I don't think the nine‐to‐five
is my groove anymore.

06:21.506 --> 06:25.385
You see, work is
the imprisonment
of the spirit and the soul.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.013
And you, you are
the only prison that I need.

06:28.013 --> 06:31.433
And all I want to do
is spend some hard time

06:31.433 --> 06:33.643
in your arms this weekend.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.186
Uh...

06:35.186 --> 06:37.063
Okay, stop it, stop it.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.940
Oh, my God,
something's moving
in your beard.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.233
Oh, God.

06:42.694 --> 06:45.530
So, guess what idiot father
promised his little girl

06:45.530 --> 06:47.282
a pony ride
for her party?

06:47.282 --> 06:49.492
Where am I gonna find a pony
in the middle of Manhattan?

06:49.492 --> 06:51.453
(ponies neigh)

06:52.787 --> 06:54.247
Where am I gonna find
a bag of money

06:54.247 --> 06:55.582
in the middle of Manhattan?

06:56.833 --> 06:58.376
The street fair.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.670
Yes! This is genius!

07:00.670 --> 07:03.048
I'll tell Emma that the fair
is actually her birthday party.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.550
I can hang a few signs,
add a couple of balloons,

07:05.550 --> 07:07.636
she gets a pony ride
with all her little friends,

07:07.636 --> 07:09.095
and she'll think
I'm the greatest dad ever.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.556
I'm so much better at this
than you were.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.933
‐Oh!
‐Watch where
you're going!

07:13.933 --> 07:15.477
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.

07:15.477 --> 07:16.519
Are you okay?

07:16.519 --> 07:18.688
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.857
You're sure you're okay?

07:20.857 --> 07:22.233
‐All good.
‐(engine revs)

07:26.613 --> 07:28.031
I think I know her.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.076
I had a scooter
like that once.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.536
You know, till I drove it
right into a coffee shop.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.664
That barista
never stood a chance.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.749
She also never stood again.

07:37.749 --> 07:38.792
I should call her.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.673
I feel like the world's
worst girlfriend.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.383
You are.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.718
Danny is so sweet and kind

07:48.718 --> 07:50.178
and I always take him
for granted.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.638
You do.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.348
I honestly don't deserve him.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.557
You don't.

07:56.184 --> 07:59.604
Riley, look, I know
you want me to sit here

07:59.604 --> 08:01.773
and say,
"Oh, it's not that bad,"

08:01.773 --> 08:04.401
but I'm on Danny's side
on this one.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.777
You're kind of selfish.

08:05.777 --> 08:08.196
(scoffs)
No, I'm not.

08:08.196 --> 08:11.366
Just because I occasionally
put my needs before others

08:11.366 --> 08:13.743
does not make me selfish.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.287
Uh, yeah, actually, it does.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.831
And I know that
because when I tried tell you

08:17.831 --> 08:19.791
about my amazing job offer‐‐

08:19.791 --> 08:21.835
Ugh! I just feel like
I've ruined everything.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.839
‐We just got back together.
‐You just kept talking.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.717
I mean, he has to know
how much I love him.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.260
There isn't a second
in the day where

08:30.260 --> 08:32.345
I'm not thinking
about Danny‐‐ Holy crap.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.305
I was supposed to meet him
for dinner an hour ago.

08:46.568 --> 08:47.736
Hey, it's Danny Wheeler.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.863
Let's talk about
about that Vancouver offer.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.496
No, it's Perrin with a P.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.665
Oh, sorry, can you
hold on one second?

09:00.665 --> 09:02.834
Oh, my God, I have
the most brilliant idea.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.045
You decided to become
a crazy bird lady.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.629
It was only a matter of time.

09:06.629 --> 09:10.633
No. This is Danny and Riley.

09:10.633 --> 09:14.471
Yeah, I am going to out‐romance
the romance king. Okay?

09:14.471 --> 09:16.014
I'm gonna have
Danny meet me on the roof,

09:16.014 --> 09:18.600
and then dressed as Riley Girl,
my super‐secret alter ego

09:18.600 --> 09:21.019
that he loves
more than anything,
I'm gonna swoop in,

09:21.019 --> 09:22.729
release the lovebirds,
who will soar into the sky

09:22.729 --> 09:26.066
just as my message
of love is being written
across the sunset.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.734
And if that doesn't say
"I love you,"

09:27.734 --> 09:28.860
I don't know what does.

09:28.860 --> 09:29.652
Hold on.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.654
Sorry, can it say,
"I love you"?

09:32.655 --> 09:34.449
You're a nut‐job.

09:34.449 --> 09:35.825
Shut up, Tucker.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.453
All right, four o'clock?
Yeah, that's perfect.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.746
And you have the address?

09:39.746 --> 09:41.456
Okay. Great.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.666
Oh, he's gonna flip
when he sees these birds.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.754
Ooh, hot wings.
Yeah, that's what
I want for dinner.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.760
Sorry I'm late, Bon‐Bon,

09:53.760 --> 09:56.346
but I got caught up
in this wonderful meditation

09:56.346 --> 09:57.806
in Central Park.

09:57.806 --> 10:00.266
See, that's the thing
about past lives.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.936
You can't see just one.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.524
Oh, Bonnie, we gotta
get out of this city

10:07.524 --> 10:09.442
and you need
to come with me!

10:09.442 --> 10:11.820
What are all
my suits doing out?

10:12.904 --> 10:15.156
Well, you know,
I just wanted to help free you

10:15.156 --> 10:18.076
from your corporate overlord
Gucci and Armani.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.036
I mean, who needs
beautiful suits

10:20.036 --> 10:22.956
when you've got trees
and... man‐dals.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.792
Right.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.086
‐Oh!
‐Oh, yeah, yeah.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.129
That was a good one.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.589
I ripped it right off of you
on our first date.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.550
‐(chuckles)
‐Oh, there's just something

10:33.550 --> 10:36.010
about a man in a suit
I can't resist.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.638
I'm going out, so.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.848
Wait, Bonnie,

10:39.848 --> 10:42.809
you really think we should
just throw out... everything?

10:42.809 --> 10:45.728
‐I mean, maybe we could keep
a few pieces for‐‐
‐Shh!

10:45.728 --> 10:47.480
Just say goodbye.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.984
And remember,
if you love something,
set it free.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.862
If it come backs to you,
wind chimes.

10:56.698 --> 10:57.907
Where the hell is everybody?

10:57.907 --> 11:00.785
Family meetings are called
for important events only.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.662
Like Emma's birthday party.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.831
Or when Mom gets arrested.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.959
Wait a minute,
are we having a meeting?

11:07.959 --> 11:10.628
I'm just here 'cause the cable
is out in my room.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.005
There you are!
Hey, I have a list of stuff‐‐

11:12.005 --> 11:13.715
No time!
Riley just called and said

11:13.715 --> 11:15.175
there's an emergency
on the roof.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.511
Well, once again, it looks like
it's gonna be all up to me.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.347
Am I the only one here
who's... Emma's father?

11:21.347 --> 11:22.849
Dammit!

11:24.142 --> 11:27.103
Riley bit Danny's head off
and flew away with a pigeon.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.858
What about the skywriting?

11:31.858 --> 11:33.860
Oh no! The skywriting!

11:42.952 --> 11:45.038
"Shut up Tucker."

11:46.915 --> 11:48.708
I do get that a lot.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.378
All right, here you go.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.630
The Emma Birthday Brew.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.757
Wish the little girl
a happy birthday.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.175
Then no beer
for you, buddy.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.261
I want to ride a pony.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.846
And you will, sweetie. Okay?

12:01.846 --> 12:03.932
Daddy just needs to get
these nice people drunk first.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.689
What am I gonna do
about Danny?

12:11.689 --> 12:13.274
Just say you're sorry.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.902
Honestly, I'd recommend
getting it tattooed

12:15.902 --> 12:17.695
somewhere on your body
for convenience.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.030
No, no.

12:19.030 --> 12:21.032
This is too important, okay?

12:21.032 --> 12:24.661
He has to know
that he is everything to me.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.829
Wh‐‐ That's it.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.706
The white horse.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.541
The ultimate symbol of love.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.711
I'll ride up
and whisk Danny away.

12:33.711 --> 12:36.798
Yeah, I just wish
somebody would whisk me
away from you.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.096
Brad?

12:44.180 --> 12:45.848
What are you doing?

12:45.848 --> 12:47.475
I'm selling it, Bonnie.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.185
I am selling it all!

12:49.185 --> 12:51.479
This way we'll have enough money
to go on the road together

12:51.479 --> 12:52.772
and live off the land.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.942
I already have
this amazing recipe
for yak yogurt.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.151
It's a little bit salty.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.487
I'm not sure
if I'm milking him right.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.863
(gagging)

13:00.863 --> 13:02.949
Bonnie, I've moved
you to tears.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.910
Oh, this is gonna be wonderful!

13:05.910 --> 13:07.120
(sputters)

13:08.830 --> 13:10.123
All right, here you go.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.376
Hey, next time you invite
Emma's friends to a party,

13:13.376 --> 13:15.753
maybe you don't get
their parents wasted
on free beer.

13:15.753 --> 13:18.006
Here, give me one of them.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.340
You pump that keg,
I'll pump this one.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.883
‐Okay.
‐Hi, bud!

13:20.883 --> 13:22.510
And have you seen Riley?

13:22.510 --> 13:24.595
I swear I haven't talked
to her in like two days.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.347
No apology, nothing.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.516
It's like
she doesn't even
care about me.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.643
Whoa! Danny!

13:30.643 --> 13:32.061
What was that?

13:32.061 --> 13:33.187
Pony!

13:33.187 --> 13:36.107
I know, honey.
In a little while, okay?

13:36.107 --> 13:37.525
Keg, Danny.
Keg. Let's go.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.658
No, no, no,
no, no, little girl.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.701
No pony ride yet, okay?

13:47.701 --> 13:50.037
I'm sorry, but this
isn't your daddy's fault.

13:50.037 --> 13:52.123
It's everyone else's.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.874
And there's your first
birthday present,

13:53.874 --> 13:55.376
a lesson on shifting blame.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.295
So what do you think?

13:58.295 --> 13:59.922
Danny will love it, right?

13:59.922 --> 14:02.174
Wow.

14:02.174 --> 14:05.845
How bad were your other ideas
if this is the one you chose?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.721
No, Danny will love it.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.056
It's a symbol of his heart.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.432
Which you're breaking.

14:10.432 --> 14:11.976
Shut up, Tucker!

14:11.976 --> 14:13.561
Wow, you really do
get that a lot.

14:14.979 --> 14:15.980
(rattling)

14:17.273 --> 14:19.108
Hey there, moon boy.

14:19.108 --> 14:23.404
It's your cosmic concubine
ready to ride the solar waves.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.989
‐Bonnie?
‐Mm‐hmm.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.031
What happened to you?

14:26.031 --> 14:27.616
You happened to me.

14:27.616 --> 14:30.870
I'm here to mingle our chakras
and talk to my soul child.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.246
And you were right.

14:32.246 --> 14:35.040
I don't need work
or ambitions or money

14:35.040 --> 14:37.626
or nice things
or razors.

14:37.626 --> 14:40.004
Definitely not razors.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.547
This is insane.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.799
Oh, my God, thank goodness.
I was so worried that‐‐

14:43.799 --> 14:46.177
I've literally
never been happier.

14:46.177 --> 14:47.511
This is all that
I've ever wanted.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.555
What? No!

14:49.555 --> 14:51.640
No! No! No!

14:51.640 --> 14:54.476
This isn't what
you always wanted!

14:54.476 --> 14:56.228
(tambourine rattles)

14:56.228 --> 15:02.276
I am a beautiful,
vibrant, and sexy woman

15:02.276 --> 15:05.446
with goals,
ambitions, and drive!

15:05.446 --> 15:08.908
I mean, things that
you actually used to have!

15:08.908 --> 15:11.410
I don't even know
who you are anymore!

15:11.410 --> 15:13.996
God! I don't want dirt floors

15:13.996 --> 15:17.166
or inner peace
or anything made out of hemp!

15:17.166 --> 15:19.501
This is what
you always wanted!

15:19.501 --> 15:21.629
This is who you married!

15:23.839 --> 15:26.508
Bonnie‐‐ Bonnie, wait!

15:26.508 --> 15:29.136
Excuse me, excuse me.
Heart coming through.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.848
(phone rings)

15:34.058 --> 15:35.142
Oh, my God!

15:35.142 --> 15:36.852
Oh, my God! This is it!
This is the call!

15:36.852 --> 15:38.312
Riley:
What? Now?
No, Tucker!

15:38.312 --> 15:40.314
‐You have to help me!
‐Hey, hey, don't make me

15:40.314 --> 15:42.149
tell people you're full
of candy, all right?

15:44.276 --> 15:45.527
Tucker Dobbs.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.155
I did?

15:48.155 --> 15:50.366
Oh, my God,
that's amazing!
Thank you!

15:50.366 --> 15:51.784
Oh, my God.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.327
I did it! I did it!

15:53.327 --> 15:54.954
I got the job!
I'm going to Hollywood!

15:54.954 --> 15:56.789
Aww, congratulations!

15:58.165 --> 16:00.000
Are you hugging me?

16:00.000 --> 16:02.086
Mom, finally.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.254
Look, I don't know
what's going on,

16:03.254 --> 16:05.214
but there's really no excuse
for you being two hours late

16:05.214 --> 16:06.715
to your granddaughter's
birthday party.

16:06.715 --> 16:08.259
My marriage is over.

16:08.259 --> 16:11.053
Okay, I will accept that
as an excuse.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.179
I have been dunked,

16:12.179 --> 16:14.765
painted, and pummeled,
and I still haven't seen Riley.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.225
I'm done, man.
I'm going home.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.310
No, no! Neither of you
are going anywhere.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.353
Look, nothing is gonna stop me

16:19.353 --> 16:21.897
from taking my daughter
on a pony ride.

16:21.897 --> 16:23.274
Except for whatever
the hell that is.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.567
Danny Wheeler,

16:25.567 --> 16:28.362
I give you
your heart's desire.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.781
Oh, dude, I'm sorry.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.241
I just don't feel
the same way.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.535
Um, it's me.
(giggles)

16:34.535 --> 16:35.703
Riley?

16:35.703 --> 16:39.039
‐Danny, I am here...
‐(thump)

16:39.039 --> 16:40.874
to show you that...

16:40.874 --> 16:43.252
no matter what,
I will always...

16:43.252 --> 16:45.296
Oh, God!
Tucker, help me!

16:45.296 --> 16:47.881
Be here for you.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.217
There.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.260
What is all this?

16:52.511 --> 16:54.596
Look, Danny...

16:54.596 --> 16:57.141
I'm so sorry for taking
you for granted.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.434
And for being so selfish.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.353
And I just want
you to know that...

17:01.353 --> 17:04.231
you are literally
everything to me.

17:04.231 --> 17:07.401
So, if you want to go to Canada,
I will go to Canada with you.

17:07.401 --> 17:10.779
And if you want to stay here,
I will stay here with you.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.992
Because if we're together,
we can figure anything out.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.077
I love you, Danny.

17:19.663 --> 17:23.375
Okay, not 100% sure
what that was all about.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.919
Now can someone please
watch this stupid booth

17:25.919 --> 17:28.380
so I can take my daughter
for a birthday pony ride?

17:29.965 --> 17:32.426
Emma? Where the hell
did she go? Emma!

17:32.426 --> 17:34.303
(pony neighing)

17:34.303 --> 17:37.097
‐Emma! No!
‐(Emma cries)

17:40.100 --> 17:41.977
I'm so sorry
this happened to you.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.314
Stupid pony.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.733
It's been the worst birthday
ever and it's all my fault.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.276
(door opens)

17:49.276 --> 17:53.322
All:
Is she okay? Sweetie!
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?

17:53.322 --> 17:55.991
Hey, man, I'm sorry.

17:55.991 --> 17:58.494
Look, we should have
been there to help you.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.912
Don't worry.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.498
I'm not gonna take
that job in LA.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.625
I don't ever want
to leave you guys.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.670
What job in LA?
Man, you never tell me anything.

18:09.380 --> 18:11.048
‐We're staying too.
‐Yeah.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.549
Definitely not going anywhere.

18:12.549 --> 18:15.094
Look, I love you guys.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.096
You've given up so much
of your lives to help us,

18:17.096 --> 18:19.973
but now you have to go
live your own lives.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.393
And if that means I have to
make even more sacrifices

18:22.393 --> 18:24.395
for Emma,
then so be it.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.106
We'll be fine on our own.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.273
Right, Emma?

18:29.274 --> 18:31.276
Bonnie!

18:31.276 --> 18:32.820
Brad?
(gasps)

18:32.820 --> 18:34.363
I love you.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.240
And if that means looking
like a horribly sexy,

18:36.240 --> 18:38.701
suit‐wearing worker bee
in this dirty, loud city,

18:38.701 --> 18:40.202
well, then so be it!

18:44.415 --> 18:46.458
Oh, I love you too.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.837
And if you're not happy here,
I'll make the sacrifice.

18:49.837 --> 18:53.298
‐Let's travel the world
and be happy everywhere!
‐(chuckles)

18:53.298 --> 18:55.134
But if you would keep
this look though,

18:55.134 --> 18:56.135
that would be
super helpful.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.346
Really? You'll travel
the world with me?

18:59.346 --> 19:00.973
I am right on the fence.

19:03.392 --> 19:06.270
But, you know,
I think Ben can handle
things here for a while.

19:07.312 --> 19:10.149
So what do you say
we open up some presents

19:10.149 --> 19:11.442
and get this party started?

19:11.442 --> 19:15.279
‐Right?
‐Wait. Actually,
before we do that, um...

19:15.279 --> 19:17.239
I have a present for Danny.

19:19.199 --> 19:20.534
What are you doing?

19:22.369 --> 19:26.248
I didn't want to tell you this
until I knew we were perfect.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.709
Remember when I said
I had a bunch of news?

19:28.709 --> 19:31.420
Turns out that test
I took wasn't right.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.842
I'm pregnant.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.221
(all cheering)

19:49.188 --> 19:51.315
It's been quite a day, huh?

19:51.315 --> 19:53.817
Trust me, everything is
gonna be just fine.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.527
Even if everybody
moves out of town,

19:55.527 --> 19:58.280
it doesn't mean
they don't love you
anymore, okay?

19:58.280 --> 20:01.366
And just know
I'm never going anywhere.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.494
It's gonna be me and you
forever and ever, kid.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.497
We're just gonna
take a cab home tonight.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.207
Here. Come on.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.291
(grunts)

20:09.291 --> 20:11.710
You're a big girl.
You're a big girl now.

20:11.710 --> 20:14.213
‐All right.
‐It was my birthday!

20:14.213 --> 20:15.881
Yeah, it was
your birthday. Come on.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.591
There you go.

20:17.591 --> 20:19.635
‐Mott and Spring, please.
‐Oh!

20:21.345 --> 20:22.387
Excuse me.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.097
Think your little girl
dropped this.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.432
Oh. Thanks.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.895
It‐‐ it's her.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.746
Just five more minutes, please?

20:47.746 --> 20:49.206
She's got to be
around here somewhere.

20:49.206 --> 20:52.042
Dude, we have been sitting here
for like three hours.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.627
You don't even know
if she lives here

20:53.627 --> 20:55.087
or works near here.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.631
I'm telling you,
there's something about her.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.091
I think she's the one.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.469
I know I've said that before,
but this time I mean it.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.847
I know I said that before, too.

21:06.557 --> 21:08.475
All right, let's go.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.018
But I'm gonna find her.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.526
‐Is anyone sitting here?
‐Uh, no.
