00:00.125 --> 00:02.311
<i>Previously, on "Shades of Blue"...</i>

00:02.336 --> 00:03.735
<i>He will never stop.</i>

00:03.737 --> 00:06.432
<i>He is going to keep coming after me.</i>

00:06.507 --> 00:08.407
<i>I was hoping you could pull a DNA report</i>

00:08.476 --> 00:10.375
so I can pair it to a new sample.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.144
His name is Miguel Zepeda.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.179
<i>He's been texting as if he's Miguel,</i>

00:14.248 --> 00:16.347
<i>posing as some private investigator,</i>

00:16.417 --> 00:17.749
<i>using her to get to me.</i>

00:17.852 --> 00:19.184
Come near my daughter again,

00:19.253 --> 00:20.986
and nobody will ever find you.

00:21.055 --> 00:23.522
I recommend a suspension,
effective immediately.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.624
<i>The Fed... they're chasing Bianchi,</i>

00:25.693 --> 00:29.083
but I wanna make sure that
they don't get you instead.

00:29.152 --> 00:32.165
You say there's a bullet
waiting for us allomewhere.

00:32.231 --> 00:33.130
<i>There's gonna be blood.</i>

00:35.803 --> 00:37.469
Woz, get down!

00:39.439 --> 00:41.373
You're gonna hunt these shooters down.

00:41.441 --> 00:43.608
This is Elena, Bianchi's side piece.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.511
We're gonna play a fun little game.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.086
Where's Bianchi?

00:48.111 --> 00:50.010
Too bad I don't have a son
to step in front of it for me.

00:51.126 --> 00:52.917
All right, I'll tell you!
But it won't matter.

00:52.942 --> 00:54.586
He's got dirt on everybody
who's anybody in New York.

00:54.655 --> 00:57.255
- Where does he keep this dirt?
- Lawyer's office.

00:57.324 --> 00:59.191
There's a box locked up there.

<i>We got to get him to the hospital!</i>

01:19.112 --> 01:21.146
<i>Get me the 12-gauge from the pantry!</i>

01:23.275 --> 01:26.487
<i>Heavy fire. Requesting immediate backup.</i>

01:29.114 --> 01:31.857
So much for remodeling the kitchen.

01:32.618 --> 01:35.630
You shouldn't be here,
not when it looks like this.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.788
I needed to see it.

01:39.424 --> 01:41.658
Where does it end, Woz?

01:41.727 --> 01:44.427
How many more bodies
do we need to leave behind?

01:44.496 --> 01:46.696
I sleep fine.

01:46.765 --> 01:48.431
So should you.

01:52.604 --> 01:55.071
You got blood on your shirt.

01:55.140 --> 01:57.309
I have others.

01:58.410 --> 02:01.396
Gonna come a day
when it doesn't wash off.

02:03.315 --> 02:06.349
You want to set the world right again?

02:06.944 --> 02:09.519
There's a price we gotta pay.

02:10.322 --> 02:13.256
So long as I can live
with myself when it's over.

02:14.034 --> 02:17.587
It's not over until
we get that mobster, Bianchi.

02:17.656 --> 02:19.830
Then we can worry about living with it.

02:19.898 --> 02:22.499
You heard what his mistress said.

02:23.377 --> 02:27.548
That box of secrets Bianchi has
is a dead man's switch.

02:29.311 --> 02:31.879
She also told us where he is right now,

02:32.736 --> 02:34.636
and who knows how long he'll stay there?

02:34.704 --> 02:35.937
Yeah, and who knows what kind of trouble

02:36.006 --> 02:37.939
waits for us in that box?

02:38.008 --> 02:40.708
Woz, we entered this nightmare
by kicking through a door

02:40.777 --> 02:43.278
without knowing what it would bring.

02:44.547 --> 02:48.316
Caroline, Julia, Nate.

02:48.385 --> 02:50.005
He shot my boy.

02:50.073 --> 02:52.114
And he'll pay for it.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.514
If we can't tie him to that,
we'll tie him

02:54.583 --> 02:57.016
to the two dead bodies
at his mistress' apartment

02:57.085 --> 02:58.704
in need of a perp.

02:59.654 --> 03:01.721
And then we pick him up.

03:01.790 --> 03:04.224
But first, we got to get that box.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.170
Yo, yo, just 'cause you got a suit, man,

03:17.239 --> 03:18.438
don't mean you own the sidewalk.

03:18.506 --> 03:19.739
What the hell, bro?

03:23.245 --> 03:25.972
Last man out, lawyer's floor
is completely clear.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.997
I thought cops had bad hours.

03:30.001 --> 03:31.945
Can I help you gentlemen?

03:32.370 --> 03:34.437
Detectives, what can I do you for?

03:34.506 --> 03:36.239
Have you seen this girl around?

03:39.891 --> 03:40.890
What did she do?

03:40.977 --> 03:43.179
Pickpocket, prowls
the Wall Street happy hours.

03:43.248 --> 03:44.914
Takes over 10 grand.

03:50.221 --> 03:52.021
You sure about the cameras?

03:52.090 --> 03:54.072
Yeah, the firm only installed them

03:54.097 --> 03:56.718
in the supply room
to deter employee theft.

03:56.787 --> 03:59.254
No eyes in the hallways or the offices?

03:59.323 --> 04:01.156
No, not according to
the very helpful clerk

04:01.225 --> 04:02.758
at the alarm company.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.634
No crime scene tape.

04:12.702 --> 04:16.337
We made it here before
the neighbors noticed the smell.

04:16.406 --> 04:19.741
Your respect for the dead is
really something, you know that?

04:19.810 --> 04:21.238
I respect the dead by putting away

04:21.307 --> 04:23.372
the people that killed them.

04:24.790 --> 04:27.282
Why didn't Woz just call it in
when he found them shot?

04:28.351 --> 04:30.885
It's best for him to stay out of it.

04:30.954 --> 04:32.420
This is staying out of it?

04:41.656 --> 04:43.665
Bianchi pulled the trigger himself?

04:44.476 --> 04:46.734
Cautionary tale.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.170
Don't date mobsters.

04:49.607 --> 04:51.382
Well, she'll get the last laugh.

04:51.451 --> 04:54.861
Bianchi's definitely gonna
do some time for this one.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.934
Imagine that, a safe behind a picture.

05:04.003 --> 05:05.569
Unless this has a custom program,

05:05.638 --> 05:07.946
these things usually have
a four-digit combination.

05:08.015 --> 05:11.509
Well, let's hope this asshat
was too cheap for an upgrade.

05:13.646 --> 05:17.281
When you're ready,
start giving me numbers.

05:18.684 --> 05:22.005
1-3-7-9.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.329
You sure you haven't seen her?

05:23.398 --> 05:24.898
It's not a face a man would forget.

05:24.966 --> 05:26.533
That body neither.

05:28.503 --> 05:30.603
Hey, I saw on the news about those cops

05:30.672 --> 05:32.605
who got shot at the other night.

05:32.674 --> 05:34.340
Do you know those guys?

05:43.969 --> 05:45.752
Tell you one thing, I am not gonna

05:45.821 --> 05:48.457
scroll through her pictures.

05:50.459 --> 05:52.492
Okay, "Bianchi re...

05:53.503 --> 05:54.694
"recuires answers.

05:54.763 --> 05:55.995
Wants to meet at my place tonight."

05:56.064 --> 05:57.831
You spelled "requires" wrong.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.266
Oh, I'm trying to make it authentic.

06:00.886 --> 06:03.269
She strikes me as a bad speller.

06:05.053 --> 06:06.350
Uh-huh.

06:14.132 --> 06:16.465
Scratch 3-1-7-9.

06:19.470 --> 06:21.570
What was that? 3-1-7-9?

06:21.639 --> 06:23.639
Woz are you even... what?

06:23.708 --> 06:25.041
What?

06:30.348 --> 06:32.348
Try 1973.

06:39.490 --> 06:40.923
Oh!

06:40.992 --> 06:42.804
Secretariat.

06:42.829 --> 06:44.293
That's when he won
the Triple Crown, 1973.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.239
My dad used to bet the ponies.

06:46.329 --> 06:47.228
Whoa.

06:47.265 --> 06:50.032
- Now for the fun part.
- Wow, did we get lucky.

06:50.101 --> 06:51.901
Yeah, let's see which one
of these puppies'll

06:51.970 --> 06:54.136
put Bianchi away permanently.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.350
I wonder how close Woz came
to interrupting

06:59.419 --> 07:01.863
their little lovers' quarrel.

07:03.031 --> 07:04.665
All right, you ready
to wake the neighbors?

07:04.690 --> 07:06.123
Yeah.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.126
NYPD, open up!

07:16.516 --> 07:18.270
Elena, it's the police. Open up!

07:18.339 --> 07:19.397
Material witness.

07:19.679 --> 07:20.883
She could be in trouble in there.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.041
Then I guess we don't have a choice.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.483
This is just
a bunch of jewelry and a will.

07:31.552 --> 07:35.687
Nothing juicy enough to ensure
a mobster doesn't stay in jail.

07:35.756 --> 07:39.250
Dirty pictures,
and no politicos I recognize,

07:39.319 --> 07:41.260
so this ain't it.

07:42.329 --> 07:46.298
All right, well, fingers crossed.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.232
- Oh, wait, this has to be it.
- Yeah.

07:54.301 --> 07:57.174
What Bianchi's mistress said
he has in here,

07:57.310 --> 07:58.977
I buy the high-tech roadblock.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.912
This one's coming with us.

08:02.286 --> 08:04.749
Guy's snorting a line of coke
off her thigh.

08:05.819 --> 08:06.731
See, that's unbelievable.

08:06.756 --> 08:08.606
The action ain't out there with us, man.

08:08.631 --> 08:10.855
It ain't.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.759
You know, I was wondering, uh...

08:14.828 --> 08:15.827
What?

08:16.443 --> 08:18.430
It is true there's really
a helipad on the roof?

08:18.498 --> 08:19.597
For sure, brah.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.512
Killer view. Come on.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.092
I'll take you up. Really?

08:23.161 --> 08:24.961
- Yeah.
- Go on, man, I'll stick here.

08:25.029 --> 08:28.531
If anyone comes in, NYPD
has you covered, all right?

08:52.837 --> 08:54.759
Oh, God, what are you doing here?

08:54.784 --> 08:56.784
Shouldn't we be asking you that?

08:57.579 --> 08:59.346
I was planing to be here 20 minutes ago
to serve the coffee.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.986
I was planing to be here 20 minutes ago
to serve the coffee.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.168
Still can't use these 4 a.m. London calls.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.211
It's a lot during midterms.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.139
Oh, it's inhuman, but don't worry.

09:10.169 --> 09:12.160
We grabbed some coffee on the way in.

09:13.038 --> 09:15.172
I'm sorry, who are you again?

09:17.877 --> 09:19.793
Oh, uh...

09:21.347 --> 09:23.714
we work for Mr. Shelton,

09:23.783 --> 09:26.083
dropping off files.

09:26.152 --> 09:28.152
Off hours sometimes.

09:28.593 --> 09:30.220
Okay, I just...

09:31.262 --> 09:33.557
I don't remember
anyone mentioning a delivery.

09:33.626 --> 09:35.726
We don't have time.

09:35.795 --> 09:39.012
Okay, I got this. Go.

09:39.081 --> 09:40.464
I'll be right behind you.

09:40.533 --> 09:44.281
Look, some of the clients here
really value their privacy,

09:44.334 --> 09:46.234
and we do work for them that they prefer

09:46.303 --> 09:48.446
not everyone know about.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.492
Don't worry, everything's fine.

09:52.876 --> 09:56.911
I work two jobs to put myself
through law school.

09:56.980 --> 09:58.947
Please, I don't want any trouble.

09:59.016 --> 10:00.382
Neither do we, okay?

10:00.450 --> 10:03.251
A girl who gets up at 4:00 a.m.
for a meeting to pay for tuition

10:03.320 --> 10:05.755
is a girl with a bright future.

10:06.490 --> 10:08.590
Nothing needs to get in the way of that.

10:14.472 --> 10:16.531
Check the clock.

10:16.891 --> 10:19.019
There's hidden camera
the senior partner uses

10:19.088 --> 10:20.635
to spy on how many breaks we take.

10:22.272 --> 10:24.239
Son of a...

10:32.048 --> 10:34.238
Look, you're gonna be fine.

10:35.191 --> 10:36.828
Just go.

10:37.345 --> 10:38.777
Get ready for your call.

10:43.284 --> 10:45.084
Go.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.633
If we can't open it,
why don't we take it

10:51.658 --> 10:53.389
to Bianchi's skull? Eh, it's tempting,

10:53.414 --> 10:54.636
but then he'd know we have it.

10:54.828 --> 10:56.798
Without a fingerprint,
some schmuck's gonna spend

10:56.823 --> 10:59.490
his days drilling titanium steel.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.327
I walked into that one.

11:03.396 --> 11:06.063
Go to my garage. Use whatever you need.

11:06.132 --> 11:08.699
Make sure nobody's following you.

11:08.768 --> 11:11.602
And if anybody shows up
who's not me or my wife...

11:11.671 --> 11:12.737
I got it, I got it.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.205
Shoot first.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.740
Good, save us both the trouble

11:15.809 --> 11:18.543
and put the cuffs on yourself, genius.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.478
You should invite Nava over again.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.547
It was fun to see you all
squirmy and uncomfortable.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.415
I was not.

11:24.484 --> 11:25.950
Do you love him?

11:26.352 --> 11:27.718
I'm glad you're enjoying this.

11:27.787 --> 11:29.669
See? Squirmy and uncomfortable.

11:29.707 --> 11:30.740
Hey, wait up!

11:30.783 --> 11:32.656
Don't you have a geography
test you have to ace?

11:32.725 --> 11:35.125
- Geometry.
- I thought it was geography.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.527
Well, then I wasted a lot of time

11:36.595 --> 11:38.448
on the Pythagorean theorem.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.767
The smiling's a nice change of pace.

11:43.836 --> 11:46.356
Well, I smile.

11:47.232 --> 11:49.540
Look, I'll pick you up right
here as soon as school's over.

11:49.608 --> 11:52.114
Mom, you practically have me
on house arrest.

11:52.904 --> 11:54.211
It's almost over.

11:54.822 --> 11:59.020
And hopefully, at the end
of today, we're smiling.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.495
Well, how?

12:00.875 --> 12:02.914
Did you find out who shot at you?

12:03.731 --> 12:05.130
You know, there's some
lucky girls out there

12:05.199 --> 12:09.629
whose biggest concern
is prom dates and pimples.

12:10.071 --> 12:12.805
Those girls aren't lucky. They're vapid.

12:14.075 --> 12:15.374
Focus on geometry.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.977
Well, now you have me worried
that it's actually geography.

12:23.184 --> 12:25.184
Seriously, Mom, I like him.

12:25.252 --> 12:27.853
So what, you're saying
"try not to screw this up"?

12:27.922 --> 12:31.557
I'm saying it's nice
to see you happy for a change.

12:31.626 --> 12:34.426
So yeah, don't screw it up.

12:34.495 --> 12:36.662
Love you.

12:44.939 --> 12:47.740
Normally, these results
take a little bit of time.

12:48.476 --> 12:51.177
You're precise and methodical.
I understand that.

12:51.246 --> 12:53.913
But a little girl may be living
in a house with a murderer,

12:53.982 --> 12:56.282
so I'm gonna wait right here

12:56.351 --> 12:58.718
while you expedite this DNA analysis.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.290
Of course, Mr. Clark.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.146
Double homicide.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.897
What's your theory?

13:10.965 --> 13:14.267
Well, it looks to me like
they both got shot in the head.

13:14.336 --> 13:16.695
You sure you don't wanna
consider a career

13:16.757 --> 13:17.977
as a detective?

13:18.005 --> 13:19.538
I'm asking if you think it was him.

13:19.607 --> 13:22.241
Yes, we believe Bianchi shot them.

13:22.310 --> 13:24.577
It was his mistress' apartment.

13:24.645 --> 13:26.178
She was the go-between.

13:26.247 --> 13:29.181
This guy here,
this is Bianchi's cleaner.

13:29.250 --> 13:31.083
So Bianchi's tying up loose ends.

13:31.152 --> 13:33.953
Gives us motive.
Can we place him at the scene?

13:34.021 --> 13:36.222
We have a string of texts from
the phone of the male victim.

13:36.290 --> 13:39.225
Suggests Bianchi was upset
that the hit on us went bad

13:39.293 --> 13:40.993
and demanded a meeting.

13:41.062 --> 13:43.892
Suggests? Was the text from Bianchi?

13:43.961 --> 13:45.374
It's from the mistress.

13:45.421 --> 13:47.785
But she said that he was
the one who made the demand.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.384
He killed them both

13:49.453 --> 13:51.753
because he didn't want
the shooting at my house

13:51.822 --> 13:53.255
to come down onto him.

13:53.324 --> 13:54.223
I believe it.

13:54.482 --> 13:56.492
That's different than
being able to prove it.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.228
I thought you said he wanted
justice for his dead girlfriend.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.198
Excuse me?

14:00.223 --> 14:01.593
Woz, he's just asking questions.

14:01.618 --> 14:04.066
We're the ones throwing
ourselves onto the line of fire.

14:04.134 --> 14:05.667
We're all just trying
to do our jobs here.

14:05.736 --> 14:07.669
Well, then why don't you do yours?

14:07.738 --> 14:10.839
Secure us an arrest warrant
so we can get this guy

14:10.908 --> 14:12.374
before he vanishes.

14:12.443 --> 14:13.909
He's slipped the cuffs before.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.396
Which is why we need you.

14:15.421 --> 14:17.746
Bianchi has his eyes and ears
all over the courts.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.948
If he knows we're coming, he'll run.

14:20.017 --> 14:23.012
Or we'll march right into our own death.

14:23.787 --> 14:25.601
Isn't there a judge that you can go to

14:25.626 --> 14:26.888
for the arrest warrant?

14:26.913 --> 14:29.556
Someone you trust
who can keep this quiet?

14:29.581 --> 14:30.624
We could link him

14:30.661 --> 14:32.599
to the double murder and the shooting.

14:32.668 --> 14:36.651
We know what his location is,
but we don't know for how long.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.668
This is our shot, James.

14:41.797 --> 14:43.045
That's impossible.

14:43.113 --> 14:44.196
Test it again.

14:44.265 --> 14:46.300
I'm not saying there's
no genetic connection.

14:46.369 --> 14:47.568
It's just inconclusive.

14:47.636 --> 14:48.936
How do we make it conclusive?

14:49.004 --> 14:51.238
Well, you need another sample.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.307
See this? There's no root.

14:53.376 --> 14:54.441
We can only get DNA from the root.

14:54.510 --> 14:56.210
All these crime shows have
really misled...

14:56.278 --> 14:57.578
Yeah, I know how DNA works.

14:57.646 --> 14:59.146
Well, then I don't have to tell you.

14:59.215 --> 15:00.647
The fresher the sample, the better.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.381
You get the arrest warrant?

15:06.406 --> 15:09.392
Not yet, but I want to be
in position for when we do.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.292
Tufo, get the battering ram. Let's go.

15:12.361 --> 15:13.293
Got it.

15:13.592 --> 15:15.662
Counselor, let us know
when it comes through.

15:15.731 --> 15:17.250
Harlee, let's go.

15:17.471 --> 15:19.032
Any chance I could bribe you
to sit this one out?

15:19.101 --> 15:21.001
I'll be fine. ESU will back us up.

15:21.070 --> 15:22.922
I'm talking really good bribery.

15:22.947 --> 15:25.431
A cabin in the Berkshires,
fireplace, no cell service...

15:25.500 --> 15:27.141
Would you settle for another dinner?

15:27.210 --> 15:28.909
Does that mean I passed inspection?

15:28.978 --> 15:30.978
Earned a follow-up, anyway.

15:31.046 --> 15:32.723
You know, you two are cute.

15:32.782 --> 15:34.401
You're like a soldier going off to war.

15:34.470 --> 15:36.489
Careful, you might get hit
with friendly fire.

15:36.519 --> 15:37.518
I'm just saying, you should get him

15:37.587 --> 15:39.488
one of those USO outfits.

15:56.406 --> 15:58.172
Come on, your whole timeline
is predicated

15:58.241 --> 16:00.608
on a supposition about parking.

16:00.677 --> 16:02.043
People do walk in New York City.

16:05.849 --> 16:06.981
And completely inadmissible.

16:07.050 --> 16:10.218
Why don't you get to
the real reason for your call?

16:10.287 --> 16:12.086
What are you, from the ESL intern pool?

16:12.155 --> 16:15.023
I'm sorry, sir, but there's
something I need to tell you.

16:27.937 --> 16:30.038
You said it was a man and a woman?

16:32.642 --> 16:36.110
Do you think you could ID them
from a photo?

16:36.179 --> 16:37.645
I think so.

16:37.714 --> 16:39.180
Yes.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.848
Stay right there.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.360
You've got a problem.

16:55.197 --> 16:58.125
Address is good. Thank you, Elena.

16:58.667 --> 17:00.801
All right, I'll call you when it's done.

17:00.869 --> 17:02.970
I will, promise.

17:04.173 --> 17:05.271
Nava got the warrant.

17:05.340 --> 17:07.340
He's moving.

17:07.409 --> 17:09.178
He knows he's exposed.

17:09.310 --> 17:10.477
Yeah, probably realized
that his mistress

17:10.546 --> 17:11.912
isn't returning his calls.

17:11.981 --> 17:13.579
Or the intern talked.

17:13.648 --> 17:16.282
Your conscience comes
at a price, Harlee.

17:21.089 --> 17:22.900
Gotta move.

17:23.832 --> 17:25.339
ESU's not coming, are they?

17:25.400 --> 17:26.833
We've got plenty of backup.

17:26.895 --> 17:28.752
I thought, since we went
through the trouble

17:28.777 --> 17:30.742
of planting the victim's blood
on him, getting the warrant...

17:30.767 --> 17:33.033
We're doing it smart, like you said,

17:33.102 --> 17:36.670
only I got a hunch Bianchi's
gonna resist arrest.

17:39.809 --> 17:40.775
All right, this is the end.

17:40.844 --> 17:42.545
Are you in or are you out?

17:55.741 --> 17:57.242
Hands where we can see 'em,

17:57.652 --> 18:00.345
and get out of the car slowly.

18:02.883 --> 18:06.060
I had a feeling you might
darken my doorstep.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.651
Yeah, I like to return the favor

18:07.720 --> 18:10.153
when someone comes to visit my house.

18:10.222 --> 18:12.074
I said, out of the car.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.758
Give me a reason.

18:18.998 --> 18:22.132
I heard you made
a little detour this morning.

18:22.201 --> 18:23.938
Grabbed something of mine.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.603
Sincerely hope you're here to return it.

18:26.672 --> 18:28.772
Come here, on the hood.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.641
There's nobody here to protect you now.

18:31.508 --> 18:32.786
You would've been better off

18:32.811 --> 18:34.348
taking that assault
and battery charge like a man.

18:34.416 --> 18:37.287
Tess, Loman, lock down the house.

18:37.356 --> 18:40.817
CSU is gonna be coming by
looking for trace evidence.

18:41.353 --> 18:43.520
Another frame job, wow.

18:44.065 --> 18:46.623
You guys really need to
expand your playbook.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.675
What's the charge this time?

18:48.744 --> 18:50.210
Double homicide.

18:50.279 --> 18:52.746
I can understand you
killing your cleanup guy,

18:52.815 --> 18:55.449
but why the hell would you
kill your mistress?

18:58.554 --> 19:01.521
She gave me up,
and you killed her anyway?

19:01.590 --> 19:03.457
No, you killed her.

19:03.525 --> 19:05.759
You killed her when you lit up my house

19:05.828 --> 19:08.028
and put my son in the hospital.

19:08.096 --> 19:09.930
There's more to that story.

19:09.998 --> 19:12.532
Yeah, I would've loved to have heard it.

19:12.601 --> 19:14.968
You couldn't go out like
the quiet type, could you?

19:15.037 --> 19:17.093
You gotta go out in a hail of bullets.

19:17.162 --> 19:18.939
That's the kind of mobster you are!

19:21.493 --> 19:24.127
Woz? Woz, we got company.

19:24.196 --> 19:25.429
Did someone call this in?

19:25.497 --> 19:27.798
That patrol car has a grille camera.

19:34.073 --> 19:36.840
Congratulations, detectives.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.050
- You're kidding me.
- What?

19:39.119 --> 19:40.418
I brought in NYPD Organized Crime

19:40.487 --> 19:42.287
to watch you two successfully arrest

19:42.356 --> 19:45.990
Michael Bianchi, notorious mobster.

19:46.059 --> 19:48.393
That is what you two were doing, right?

19:48.462 --> 19:49.761
Arresting him?

19:49.830 --> 19:51.129
Interrupting investigations.

19:51.198 --> 19:53.498
Is that your way of procrastinating,

19:53.567 --> 19:55.200
or are you just playing
for the other side?

19:55.268 --> 19:58.136
You go after criminals.
I go after crooked cops.

19:58.205 --> 20:00.505
Looks like we both won here, no?

20:01.016 --> 20:03.441
Come on, do we really need to go through

20:03.510 --> 20:04.743
this procession again?

20:04.811 --> 20:06.578
I hope your lawyer passed the bar

20:06.646 --> 20:07.695
and can build a defense

20:07.763 --> 20:09.881
without that box of blackmail.

20:09.950 --> 20:12.650
I wouldn't open it, sweetie.

20:12.719 --> 20:15.086
You're not gonna like what you find!

20:18.235 --> 20:19.488
<i>Will you accept a collect call</i>

20:19.513 --> 20:21.226
<i>from Riker's Island
Correctional Facility?</i>

20:21.294 --> 20:24.529
<i>- Yes.
- Hi, Mama.</i>

20:24.598 --> 20:26.631
<i>Miguel, how are you, mijo?</i>

20:26.700 --> 20:28.767
<i>I miss you, Mama.</i>

20:30.604 --> 20:32.206
<i>I miss you, Mama.</i>

20:32.239 --> 20:34.339
<i>I miss you.</i>

20:34.408 --> 20:36.037
<i>When are you coming?</i>

20:36.105 --> 20:38.587
<i>Soon, next weekend.</i>

20:38.612 --> 20:40.011
<i>I wanna see you.</i>

20:43.083 --> 20:45.150
<i>I wanna see you.</i>

20:45.219 --> 20:46.751
<i>Have you seen Cristina?</i>

20:46.820 --> 20:48.666
<i>- No.
- I asked you to.</i>

20:48.734 --> 20:50.622
<i>You know how her mother is.</i>

20:50.691 --> 20:52.109
<i>This is not right.</i>

20:52.178 --> 20:54.059
<i>We are her family.</i>

20:54.127 --> 20:56.328
<i>I miss you, Mama. I wanna see you.</i>

20:56.396 --> 20:58.196
<i>Hi, Mama... Hi, Mama.</i>

20:58.265 --> 20:59.464
<i>I wanna see you.</i>

20:59.533 --> 21:01.506
That's some crazy stuff.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.251
My mom's closest encounter with death

21:03.320 --> 21:04.303
was when she told my grandma

21:04.328 --> 21:06.432
that her turkey was dry on Thanksgiving.

21:07.424 --> 21:08.590
My mom would rather get shot at

21:08.659 --> 21:11.059
than spend Thanksgiving with my grandma.

21:11.128 --> 21:12.527
Your mom is a badass.

21:12.596 --> 21:14.529
I wish my family was that cool.

21:14.598 --> 21:16.164
You know, sometimes it'd be nice to have

21:16.233 --> 21:18.033
a more normal one.

21:18.102 --> 21:21.103
Let's go, we don't want
to be last in line.

21:21.171 --> 21:23.307
Hey, it's grilled cheese day.

21:25.075 --> 21:28.795
Um, yeah, I'm actually not that hungry.

21:28.863 --> 21:31.813
I'm just gonna stay
and study for geometry.

21:37.020 --> 21:39.621
<i>Hi, Cristina, this is your father.</i>

21:39.690 --> 21:42.157
<i>I miss you. I wanna see you.</i>

21:42.259 --> 21:43.759
Can we dispense with the handcuffs?

21:43.827 --> 21:46.128
Mr. Bianchi is
a respectable businessman.

21:46.196 --> 21:48.530
Respectable, but not bright.

21:48.599 --> 21:52.501
Your client tracked the victim's
blood into his own safe house.

21:52.569 --> 21:55.537
Are you trying to make
a career of losing prosecutions

21:55.606 --> 21:57.314
based on planted evidence?

21:57.358 --> 21:58.424
Michael, please.

21:58.493 --> 22:00.559
Strong motive, crime of passion.

22:00.628 --> 22:02.061
Found your mistress
with one of your men,

22:02.130 --> 22:03.762
and you shot 'em both.

22:03.831 --> 22:04.943
It's better this way.

22:05.012 --> 22:06.270
Organized Crime takes the collar,

22:06.338 --> 22:07.733
and we get to move on with our lives.

22:07.802 --> 22:09.668
Not while he's moving on.

22:09.737 --> 22:12.905
From behind bars. We got his blackmail.

22:12.974 --> 22:15.387
And I bet he's run out
of politicians to hide behind.

22:15.456 --> 22:16.942
Bianchi's gonna get what he deserves.

22:17.011 --> 22:19.154
He deserves a bullet.

22:20.364 --> 22:21.647
Why make it quick
when he can face a lifetime

22:21.716 --> 22:23.616
locked up as a cop shooter?

22:26.954 --> 22:28.420
Closure.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.252
I have to confess,
I wasn't sure you guys

22:52.320 --> 22:53.778
were gonna bring him in alive.

22:53.818 --> 22:56.371
I wouldn't have cried
if he gave us a reason not to.

23:01.062 --> 23:02.495
- Solid case.
- So far.

23:02.564 --> 23:04.564
We'll see what forensics digs up.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.599
I hope this brings you some peace.

23:06.668 --> 23:07.767
Thanks.

23:08.244 --> 23:10.436
I know it will eventually bring
some to Caroline's family.

23:10.505 --> 23:11.738
Yeah.

23:12.291 --> 23:13.973
But I'm gonna have to find
a new list of reasons

23:14.042 --> 23:15.544
to come visit you.

23:16.077 --> 23:17.810
Who says you need an excuse?

23:17.879 --> 23:19.812
I thought you wanted
to keep this on the DL.

23:19.881 --> 23:22.705
Well, now that you've
come over for dinner,

23:22.773 --> 23:24.150
I think the cat's out of the bag.

23:32.161 --> 23:33.427
It's Cristina.

23:33.496 --> 23:34.528
Tell her hi for me.

23:34.597 --> 23:36.396
I have to get to court.

23:38.267 --> 23:40.200
Hey, sweetie, how was your test?

23:40.269 --> 23:43.270
<i>You're the one who's about to be tested.</i>

23:43.339 --> 23:44.771
Who is this? Where's Cristina?

23:44.874 --> 23:46.773
<i>Don't worry, we've got eyes on her.</i>

23:46.842 --> 23:48.976
<i>If you don't want us to get
more acquainted with her,</i>

23:49.044 --> 23:50.844
<i>let Bianchi walk.</i>

23:50.913 --> 23:52.279
<i>Fair trade.</i>

23:55.317 --> 23:57.084
Stay away from my daughter.

23:57.152 --> 23:59.586
<i>I was about to offer
a similar instruction.</i>

23:59.655 --> 24:01.523
<i>I'm following her now.</i>

24:01.808 --> 24:05.116
<i>If I see you or any
of your cop friends, I shoot.</i>

24:05.185 --> 24:07.761
<i>I don't get a call
from Bianchi, I shoot.</i>

24:07.830 --> 24:09.189
No, wait!

24:16.788 --> 24:18.799
Eight, nine, ten.

24:18.824 --> 24:21.558
Ready or not, here I come!

24:22.152 --> 24:24.061
Cristina?

24:25.164 --> 24:28.232
Where are you?

24:39.345 --> 24:41.845
No, not behind the curtain.

24:41.914 --> 24:44.081
What was that?

24:45.108 --> 24:46.775
I think I heard something.

24:46.844 --> 24:48.595
No.

24:49.279 --> 24:50.679
You can't fool me.

24:50.747 --> 24:53.815
I know that you're hiding in the closet!

24:53.884 --> 24:55.911
What?

24:57.521 --> 25:00.732
Where could she be?

25:12.870 --> 25:14.569
Harlee?

25:14.638 --> 25:17.606
Cr... Cristina.

25:24.887 --> 25:26.477
Shh!

25:27.217 --> 25:29.150
She's awake.

25:29.219 --> 25:33.088
Hey, Harlee, who are these guys?

25:33.156 --> 25:35.218
Did they give a name? No, no.

25:35.287 --> 25:37.394
They're following Cristina.

25:38.195 --> 25:39.928
- They sent me a video.
- Hey, hey.

25:39.997 --> 25:42.697
I can't see what train it is.

25:45.711 --> 25:46.910
Look at her.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.879
She doesn't even know
how much danger she's in.

25:48.947 --> 25:52.133
- Oh, God.
- Did they say anything, Harlee?

25:52.202 --> 25:53.947
Bianchi, they want Bianchi.

25:54.015 --> 25:56.146
And we don't have him anymore.

25:56.179 --> 25:57.945
You know, if they don't get him,
they said they could...

25:58.014 --> 26:01.182
Look at me, I promise you
we're gonna find her.

26:01.250 --> 26:02.516
I'm gonna bring her home.

26:02.585 --> 26:04.021
I don't even know where she is.

26:04.046 --> 26:06.921
They have her phone,
and they turned off the GPS.

26:06.989 --> 26:08.889
Well, here, keep looking at this.

26:08.958 --> 26:13.527
See if you can find a station,
a number, anything.

26:13.596 --> 26:17.631
Woz, Woz, if this is Bianchi,
we're all targets.

26:17.700 --> 26:19.700
Have Joe take the kids out of school

26:19.769 --> 26:21.602
and then put a Uni
in front of your house.

26:21.671 --> 26:23.571
Okay. Where are you going?

26:23.639 --> 26:25.573
Woz?

26:25.641 --> 26:27.608
Did you try calling? Try texting?

26:27.677 --> 26:29.343
They have her phone, so...

26:29.412 --> 26:31.345
She's supposed to be in school.

26:31.414 --> 26:33.508
It's looks like she's
getting off at the next stop.

26:33.649 --> 26:35.649
That doesn't help us if
we don't know what train it is.

26:36.203 --> 26:39.268
Hold on, let me see this.
The paint on the pillars.

26:39.337 --> 26:41.726
See, every subway's color-coded.
This one's green.

26:41.795 --> 26:44.325
Yeah, so are about 200 others
in the city.

26:44.393 --> 26:46.694
Wait, that girl's getting off too.

26:47.432 --> 26:50.000
She goes to Hudson University,
so if she's going to class,

26:50.025 --> 26:51.725
then that narrows it down
to a few stops.

26:51.794 --> 26:53.160
She could be going home, Harlee.

26:53.229 --> 26:54.777
It's something, I mean...

26:54.846 --> 26:56.597
let's just get a subway map.

27:01.470 --> 27:03.137
<i>Ayres for Mayor, Julia's phone.</i>

27:03.205 --> 27:04.404
Can you put her on?

27:04.473 --> 27:05.739
<i>May I ask who's calling?</i>

27:05.808 --> 27:07.584
My name comes up on the phone.

27:07.810 --> 27:09.247
<i>She's in the middle of an interview.</i>

27:09.278 --> 27:12.161
<i>She won't be available
for an hour, Mr. Wozniak.</i>

27:12.230 --> 27:13.914
Yeah, ha...

27:14.591 --> 27:16.517
have her call me back, okay?

27:18.470 --> 27:19.636
What do you got?

27:19.705 --> 27:21.571
- 14th Street subway exit.
- Near Hudson University.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.683
- I don't need to know.
- Two to a car.

27:27.112 --> 27:28.478
Text her phone. Tell them that we're

27:28.547 --> 27:30.080
working on Bianchi's bail.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.358
He won't get bail.

27:31.383 --> 27:32.984
He's a flight risk. They know that.

27:33.051 --> 27:35.285
We have a stand-in
willing to take the swap.

27:35.354 --> 27:38.221
Even if it only gives Bianchi
an hour's freedom,

27:38.290 --> 27:39.522
that's gonna be enough.

27:39.591 --> 27:41.224
Bianchi's not going anywhere.

27:41.293 --> 27:44.027
Organized Crime won't let him
out of their sight.

27:44.096 --> 27:45.762
- It's my fault.
- Don't.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.330
He knew we were coming.

27:47.399 --> 27:49.799
He was warned.
This is his counterattack.

27:52.104 --> 27:56.172
The intern, I let her go.

27:56.241 --> 27:59.175
I knew she was a liability,
but I just thought

27:59.244 --> 28:00.644
she's someone else's daughter.

28:00.712 --> 28:02.612
A little mercy is a good thing.

28:02.681 --> 28:06.416
Hold on to that.
We're gonna get her back.

28:06.485 --> 28:08.451
You don't know that.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.869
- Hello?
<i>- Hello again.</i>

28:15.938 --> 28:18.194
<i>How's your day so far?</i>

28:18.263 --> 28:19.948
Tell me she's safe.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.950
<i>For now. I wish I could say</i>

28:21.984 --> 28:24.003
<i>with confidence
that it'll stay that way,</i>

28:24.072 --> 28:26.459
<i>but I suppose that's up to you.</i>

28:26.527 --> 28:28.615
We're working on getting
Bianchi out of custody.

28:28.665 --> 28:30.231
It's just gonna take time.

28:30.300 --> 28:33.568
<i>Do I sound overly patient to you?</i>

28:33.637 --> 28:36.671
Please, just tell me she's okay.

28:36.740 --> 28:38.506
<i>Not a care in the world.</i>

28:38.575 --> 28:39.941
<i>Call me back when you have him.</i>

28:40.010 --> 28:43.078
No, wait, I just... I need to see her.

28:43.638 --> 28:44.671
Send me something.

28:44.739 --> 28:46.625
Prove that she hasn't been hurt.

28:47.409 --> 28:49.342
Look, I'm doing everything
that you asked me to do,

28:49.411 --> 28:50.643
just please... hello?

28:51.713 --> 28:53.480
Hello?

28:54.716 --> 28:57.851
Hmm, I don't know.

29:01.189 --> 29:03.523
Wait, what is this?

29:03.592 --> 29:06.192
Is this a foot?

29:06.261 --> 29:08.361
I think there's somebody
hiding under this blanket!

29:08.430 --> 29:09.896
No, there's not.

29:09.965 --> 29:11.798
There you are!

29:11.867 --> 29:13.933
I knew you were under here!

29:14.002 --> 29:15.502
I missed you.

29:32.154 --> 29:34.254
Tess!

29:34.322 --> 29:35.788
Nothing?

29:39.569 --> 29:41.402
We can't cover
this whole area by ourselves.

29:41.471 --> 29:42.537
I mean, she could be anywhere.

29:42.584 --> 29:44.338
Are you sure there's nobody
that she knows around here

29:44.407 --> 29:46.240
that she could be meeting?

29:46.309 --> 29:47.742
I don't know.

29:47.811 --> 29:49.477
I mean, I don't think so.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.447
Woz, another video.

29:53.516 --> 29:55.149
Come on, where are you, baby?

29:58.188 --> 30:00.321
Wait, what... what?
Go... go back, go back!

30:00.390 --> 30:03.224
- What, where?
- Look, in the window.

30:07.497 --> 30:09.897
You son of a bitch.

30:22.404 --> 30:24.772
The hell is Stahl doing there?

30:25.442 --> 30:27.707
Doesn't matter, we need him.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.250
Well, you sure you wanna
leave Cristina's life

30:29.319 --> 30:30.418
in that creep's hands?

30:30.487 --> 30:31.953
- Whoa, whoa.
- He's got eyes on her.

30:32.021 --> 30:33.054
We don't.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.731
Did you find another way
to torpedo my life

30:51.800 --> 30:52.765
while I was sleeping?

30:52.834 --> 30:53.800
Stahl, just listen.

30:53.825 --> 30:54.868
<i>No, I'm not gonna listen to you.</i>

30:54.893 --> 30:56.703
I'm too busy filling out
unemployment forms.

30:56.771 --> 30:57.855
<i>Stop lying, okay?</i>

30:57.880 --> 30:59.806
I know you're with my daughter
right now.

30:59.875 --> 31:01.641
<i>I need your help.</i>

31:05.113 --> 31:06.746
With what?

31:06.815 --> 31:08.882
We arrested Bianchi.

31:08.951 --> 31:12.085
He got word to his men,
and they're stalking Cristina.

31:12.154 --> 31:14.154
<i>If we don't release Bianchi, she's dead.</i>

31:14.222 --> 31:15.622
Must be a real problem
if you haven't already

31:15.691 --> 31:17.157
kicked him loose.

31:17.225 --> 31:18.325
I can't get my hands on him,

31:18.393 --> 31:19.726
and I can't get eyes on Cristina.

31:19.795 --> 31:23.964
I just... I just need you
to tell me where she is.

31:24.572 --> 31:26.639
<i>This is not about you and me.</i>

31:27.903 --> 31:30.470
This is my kid.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.673
<i>Stahl, please.</i>

31:37.713 --> 31:41.014
Union Square, north side, Coffee Hut.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.491
She's at Union Square.

31:44.560 --> 31:46.627
Get eyes on Union Square, ASAP,

31:46.696 --> 31:48.395
and get a good vantage point.

31:48.464 --> 31:50.998
Don't let her recognize you
or else the stalker will know

31:51.067 --> 31:52.299
that she's got company.

32:00.376 --> 32:03.310
I see her. She's having a coffee.

32:03.379 --> 32:05.112
Is there anyone suspicious around her?

32:07.683 --> 32:09.216
Can you narrow that down?

32:11.621 --> 32:13.654
If one looks promising, point me at him.

32:13.723 --> 32:15.463
I'll recon from up close.

32:15.523 --> 32:17.524
All right, well, there's
someone who's videotaping her,

32:17.593 --> 32:19.860
so look out for that.

32:19.929 --> 32:21.729
Every person in New York
is glued to their cell phone.

32:21.797 --> 32:23.167
That won't help.

32:23.214 --> 32:24.776
All right, look, this is what we'll do.

32:24.801 --> 32:27.635
We'll get as close to Cristina
as we can and do a kamikaze run.

32:27.703 --> 32:30.351
We shield her, and then we just
get the hell out of here.

32:30.420 --> 32:32.275
No, the triggerman could be
the guy at the table

32:32.344 --> 32:33.641
right behind her.

32:34.269 --> 32:35.342
We won't make it.

32:38.331 --> 32:40.226
Stahl's gotta get her out of there.

32:40.317 --> 32:42.875
Anyone approaching
is gonna be risky, Harlee.

32:42.943 --> 32:46.296
Whoever's watching is
less likely to recognize Stahl

32:46.339 --> 32:47.289
than one of us.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.578
_

33:00.252 --> 33:02.547
She's out there all alone, Woz.

33:04.156 --> 33:06.223
Wow, this is a nice house.

33:06.292 --> 33:09.560
It's a tent. It keeps monsters out.

33:10.963 --> 33:13.297
No monsters are ever gonna find you.

33:13.366 --> 33:17.034
I will make sure of that.

33:19.138 --> 33:21.372
Hey, Cristina.

33:21.440 --> 33:23.679
Mr. Clark, what are you doing here?

33:23.710 --> 33:24.843
Your father called me.

33:24.912 --> 33:27.614
I'm sorry, he's just... he's not
gonna be able to make it.

33:29.449 --> 33:31.349
No, he wouldn't... he wouldn't
call me after a month

33:31.417 --> 33:34.079
- and then stand me up.
- He said something came up.

33:34.787 --> 33:36.654
And why would he call you and not me?

33:36.723 --> 33:39.125
He said he tried to reach you
and couldn't.

33:42.228 --> 33:44.528
My phone must've dropped
out of my bag on the subway.

33:44.597 --> 33:47.131
He, uh... he said I should
meet you here and make sure

33:47.200 --> 33:48.499
you got back to school safely.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.101
So I can walk you
to the subway right now.

33:50.169 --> 33:53.056
Well, maybe I should call him.
I could use your phone.

33:54.140 --> 33:56.618
Okay, Cristina, the truth is,
your dad's involved

33:56.687 --> 33:58.909
in something that could put you at risk.

33:58.978 --> 34:00.897
What do you mean? Something illegal?

34:00.966 --> 34:02.046
I'm sure that he's a good guy.

34:02.115 --> 34:04.150
He just... he might have gotten involved

34:04.283 --> 34:05.282
with some dangerous people,
and he doesn't want you

34:05.351 --> 34:08.052
to get involved in that too,
so we should go now.

34:08.121 --> 34:09.387
And I mean right now, Cristina.

34:09.455 --> 34:11.155
Okay.

34:11.224 --> 34:12.356
She's moving.

34:15.328 --> 34:17.661
- What are you doing?
- Just cleaning up.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.898
Keep eyes on who's following her.

34:20.967 --> 34:22.476
There's somebody with her.

34:22.502 --> 34:23.768
Wait, wait, wait, I know that guy.

34:23.835 --> 34:25.969
- Wait, that's the...
- He's an acquaintance.

34:26.039 --> 34:27.972
We needed all the help we could get.

34:28.041 --> 34:29.958
You know, I don't need a chaperone.

34:30.047 --> 34:31.424
I can get myself to school.

34:31.511 --> 34:33.476
Miguel just wanted to
make sure you were safe.

34:33.545 --> 34:35.679
I'd be safe without your assistance.

34:35.748 --> 34:38.416
Whoa, wait, hold on, blue baseball cap.

34:38.484 --> 34:41.094
<i>He was in the plaza.
He's following her now</i>

34:41.120 --> 34:42.386
<i>a few yards back.</i>

34:42.455 --> 34:43.954
I mean, if he's in some sort of danger,

34:44.023 --> 34:45.456
don't you think we should
try and help him?

34:45.525 --> 34:46.943
I'm trying to help, Cristina.

34:46.967 --> 34:48.292
If your mom finds out you ditched school

34:48.360 --> 34:50.494
to see your dad, that's it. Game over.

34:50.563 --> 34:51.629
She'll never let you see him.

34:52.190 --> 34:55.299
So we really... try to get you
there as soon as possible.

34:55.368 --> 34:57.735
I don't need a babysitter.

34:57.804 --> 34:59.270
We're made, we're made.

34:59.338 --> 35:03.040
Loman, Tufo, get ready to take him.

35:03.109 --> 35:05.242
<i>Move in, move in!</i>

35:10.216 --> 35:12.583
Seriously, stop,
you're making me uncomfortable.

35:14.720 --> 35:16.353
Hands in the air!

35:16.422 --> 35:17.922
Cristina, I'm just trying to help.

35:17.990 --> 35:19.339
Fine, you helped.

35:19.408 --> 35:20.958
I can handle my family on my own.

35:21.027 --> 35:23.427
I'll get ahold of my mom. She's a cop.

35:29.869 --> 35:32.731
Get on the ground and put
your damn hands in the air.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.449
I'd do what the woman says.

35:35.141 --> 35:36.941
Get back!

35:39.779 --> 35:41.846
Take your own advice.

35:41.914 --> 35:45.476
Get on the ground. Hands in the air.

35:48.020 --> 35:49.772
Let her go.

35:50.857 --> 35:52.323
That's entirely up to you.

35:52.391 --> 35:55.459
Do what he says, please!

36:20.053 --> 36:22.363
Well, isn't this a nice surprise?

36:22.431 --> 36:25.625
I at least owed you
a house call, don't you think?

36:26.834 --> 36:28.502
Look like you can use a drink.

36:35.318 --> 36:37.051
What were you doing out there
with my daughter?

36:37.120 --> 36:38.786
Saving her life, apparently.

36:38.855 --> 36:40.086
You're welcome, by the way.

36:40.111 --> 36:42.690
- Before I called you.
- Doing you a favor.

36:42.759 --> 36:44.929
I contacted Cristina to let her know

36:44.998 --> 36:47.061
that Miguel's no longer
reaching out to her.

36:47.130 --> 36:49.897
I warned what would happen
if you talked to her again.

36:49.966 --> 36:51.098
You'd rather, what?

36:51.167 --> 36:54.195
She kept asking about a man
who isn't coming back?

36:55.113 --> 36:57.939
A man that we both know is dead.

37:04.280 --> 37:06.298
You're stringing along this poor kid

37:06.349 --> 37:07.248
who just wants to see her father.

37:07.316 --> 37:09.627
How do you live with that guilt?
I couldn't.

37:10.853 --> 37:12.753
Guess that's the difference
between you and me.

37:12.822 --> 37:14.455
Look, this whole thing...

37:14.524 --> 37:16.824
all of it, it's done, all right?

37:16.893 --> 37:18.553
Leave it alone,

37:18.995 --> 37:21.472
and put your life back together

37:21.898 --> 37:23.964
or it will not end well
for you, I promise.

37:24.033 --> 37:26.811
- Another threat?
- No.

37:27.570 --> 37:29.272
Just how it is.

37:29.672 --> 37:32.233
You're only as sick as your secrets.

37:33.359 --> 37:35.111
That's what they say.

37:36.321 --> 37:38.712
Believe me, I know
from experience, Harlee.

37:38.781 --> 37:41.415
They can keep you in a coffin

37:41.909 --> 37:43.884
of fear and shame.

37:43.953 --> 37:48.622
But now that you've exposed me...

37:50.710 --> 37:53.327
I'm free.

37:54.630 --> 37:56.564
Yeah, I'm... I'm ashamed.

37:56.632 --> 37:59.433
I'm probably gonna lose my job,

37:59.802 --> 38:01.702
but I've got nothing left to take away.

38:05.308 --> 38:08.709
And that empowers me to do
what I always wanted.

38:08.778 --> 38:11.999
To be who I always wanted.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.197
I'll leave you to it, then.

38:13.266 --> 38:14.899
I'm serious, Harlee.

38:14.968 --> 38:18.102
The truth hurts, but it also heals,

38:18.171 --> 38:21.806
and I see you walking around,
and you're carrying

38:21.875 --> 38:25.910
all this anger and tension and terror.

38:27.714 --> 38:30.124
Your secrets have poisoned you.

38:30.884 --> 38:32.418
It's okay.

38:32.819 --> 38:35.088
'Cause soon, I'm gonna heal you.

38:50.437 --> 38:53.738
Soon, I'm gonna heal you.

39:05.485 --> 39:07.685
Alcohol and power tools.

39:08.538 --> 39:10.697
Don't you think that's
kind of a risky combination?

39:10.765 --> 39:13.098
Yeah, maybe for amateurs.

39:13.167 --> 39:15.834
As if this house hasn't
seen enough danger.

39:15.903 --> 39:17.349
This is where you keep the beer.

39:17.376 --> 39:20.005
Figured this crap assignment
should come with some perks.

39:20.074 --> 39:22.942
So how's it coming?

39:23.010 --> 39:24.109
I'm about four beers in.

39:24.178 --> 39:25.844
So slow.

39:25.913 --> 39:27.880
Is this punishment
for the transfer papers?

39:27.949 --> 39:31.083
Trust me, today,
you drew the lucky number.

39:31.152 --> 39:33.452
Well, I've been at this all day.

39:33.521 --> 39:37.423
I gotta know. What's in this thing?

39:40.368 --> 39:42.528
The sins of the city.

39:45.666 --> 39:47.091
Evening, Detective.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.926
Tell me you like pepperoni.

39:48.995 --> 39:50.602
Pretty universal, isn't it?

39:51.205 --> 39:53.238
- Quiet shift?
- Crickets.

39:53.833 --> 39:56.408
- Who's on next?
- Baxter, in a half hour.

39:57.044 --> 39:58.630
Make sure you save him a slice.

39:58.921 --> 40:00.279
Above and beyond, Harlee.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.570
Cristina?

40:07.638 --> 40:09.098
<i>I'm here, Mom.</i>

41:00.358 --> 41:03.859
A city and all her sins.

41:11.344 --> 41:13.177
You in bed already?

41:13.246 --> 41:15.122
Long day.

41:15.649 --> 41:18.049
Those geography quizzes
can really tucker you out.

41:20.720 --> 41:23.054
Sorry I couldn't pick you up.

41:23.123 --> 41:25.123
Ushered out in a patrol car.

41:25.649 --> 41:26.648
I'm the talk of the school.

41:26.717 --> 41:29.136
Mm, adds to your mystique.

41:30.521 --> 41:31.920
What are we reading?

41:31.989 --> 41:34.957
"Macbeth." Scary stuff.

41:37.128 --> 41:38.771
You remember your tent?

41:39.597 --> 41:41.691
For keeping monsters out?

41:42.199 --> 41:44.068
It never failed.

41:45.236 --> 41:47.405
Yeah, I wish we still had it.

41:48.572 --> 41:51.040
Mom, the tent was just a blanket.

41:51.108 --> 41:54.143
You were the one
who kept all the monsters out.
