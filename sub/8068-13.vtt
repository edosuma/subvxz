WEBVTT

00:03.871 --> 00:07.275
[theme music]

00:54.955 --> 00:55.756
I'm really sorry.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.024
I don't want to talk about it.

00:57.125 --> 00:59.193
I didn't know it was
going to upset you like--

00:59.293 --> 01:00.761
What's going on?

01:00.861 --> 01:02.196
I gave her a ride to work.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.831
That must have been
a hell of a ride.

01:03.931 --> 01:04.732
What'd you do?

01:04.832 --> 01:06.934
Steer with your feet?

01:07.034 --> 01:09.670
No, I drove over the
Monument Street bridge.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.305
Oh, Jackie, you didn't!

01:11.405 --> 01:13.107
Oh, good going, sis.

01:13.207 --> 01:14.408
Well, what was
I supposed to do?

01:14.508 --> 01:15.543
If we'd gone the
other way then we

01:15.643 --> 01:16.610
would have been late for work.

01:16.710 --> 01:17.678
How could you even do that?

01:17.778 --> 01:19.180
You know she freaks
out if anybody

01:19.280 --> 01:21.149
even mentions the bridge.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.083
Crystal got some kind
of hang up with bridges?

01:23.184 --> 01:25.253
Just the Monument
Street bridge.

01:25.353 --> 01:28.889
Yeah, it was killer
during rush hour.

01:28.989 --> 01:31.024
That's not funny, Booker.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.127
I'm not trying to be funny.

01:33.227 --> 01:34.995
That's right, he
doesn't know the story.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.664
He hasn't been here that long.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.399
What story?

01:38.499 --> 01:40.401
You tell him, sis.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.536
OK, come here, but you
guys have got to be good.

01:42.636 --> 01:43.504
I will, I will, I will.

01:43.604 --> 01:44.772
OK.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.808
Crystal's first husband,
Sonny, was working construction

01:47.908 --> 01:50.278
on the Monument Street bridge.

01:50.378 --> 01:53.447
And he was pouring cement
one day and he slipped--

01:53.547 --> 01:54.582
[laughs]

01:54.682 --> 02:00.754
And he-- he fell into
one of the piling molds.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.291
So you mean that he--
he fell off the bridge.

02:03.391 --> 02:06.560
Well, kind of, he sort
of fell in the bridge.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.562
Get out of here?

02:08.662 --> 02:11.732
Are you telling me that this guy
is still buried in the bridge?

02:11.832 --> 02:15.035
For the past 12 years,
and it's a very sad story.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.208
Jackie, I'm sorry.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.410
I guess I overreacted.

02:22.510 --> 02:23.411
Are you OK, Crystal?

02:23.511 --> 02:24.312
I'm fine.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.213
Jackie, I apologize.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.280
No, it's all my fault.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.448
No, it's my fault.

02:27.548 --> 02:31.219
Crystal, I drove over
it as fast as I could.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.654
It's OK.
It's all out of my system.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.790
[horn blows]

02:38.359 --> 02:40.194
Hey, Crystal.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.230
All right, these guys they're--

02:42.330 --> 02:44.064
they're goofing with me here.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.133
What's the story about your
old man being, you know,

02:46.234 --> 02:47.601
part of the Monument
Street bridge?

02:51.639 --> 02:54.975
[music playing]

02:57.044 --> 02:57.945
[phone ringing]

02:58.045 --> 02:59.913
I'll get it!

03:00.013 --> 03:01.415
Hello?
Cindy?

03:01.515 --> 03:02.683
Hey!

03:02.783 --> 03:04.418
Hey, hey, hey, you're stretching
all the natural beauty

03:04.518 --> 03:07.455
out of the phone cord.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.556
Babe?

03:08.656 --> 03:10.123
What time is Crystal
bringing Lonnie over?

03:10.224 --> 03:11.158
Any second.

03:11.259 --> 03:13.861
Hey, if she starts
talking about Sonny

03:13.961 --> 03:16.664
at all hurry up and
change the subject.

03:16.764 --> 03:18.532
Why is she thinking
about him again?

03:18.632 --> 03:25.172
Because today Jackie drove
her over the you-know-what.

03:25.273 --> 03:28.141
The bridge?

03:28.242 --> 03:30.378
You got to be kidding me.

03:30.478 --> 03:32.313
When is she going
to get over him?

03:32.413 --> 03:33.714
She probably never will, Dan.

03:33.814 --> 03:37.251
I mean he was, like, the only
guy that ever made her happy.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.986
That old Sonny made
a lot of girls happy.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.757
He did what?

03:43.857 --> 03:45.393
All I'm saying is
that old Sonny wasn't

03:45.493 --> 03:48.829
exactly husband of the year.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.399
So, uhhh, what are
you saying to me, Dan?

03:51.499 --> 03:55.202
You're telling me
that, uh, the only guy

03:55.303 --> 03:58.739
Crystal ever loved was,
like, running around on her?

04:02.042 --> 04:03.611
Cannot tell a lie.

04:03.711 --> 04:06.179
That scum bucket.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.181
Why didn't you ever
tell me he done that?

04:08.282 --> 04:10.751
Because men don't talk
about stuff like that.

04:10.851 --> 04:13.387
Yeah they do,
just to other men.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.323
Knock it off,
you little twerp!

04:15.423 --> 04:16.256
Mom!

04:16.357 --> 04:18.091
Darlene is still
on the telephone.

04:18.191 --> 04:20.728
Hey, don't come in here
rattin' on people now.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.229
Dan, he's rattin' on people.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.200
Cheese eater.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.470
[mouse sounds]

04:29.570 --> 04:32.205
Cindy, we gotta get
a pack of cigarettes.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.141
Hey, get off now.

04:34.241 --> 04:36.276
Give that phone a rest.

04:36.377 --> 04:37.578
Hold on.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.480
What are you picking on me for?

04:39.580 --> 04:42.483
Because I can't find Becky.

04:42.583 --> 04:43.384
I got to go.

04:43.484 --> 04:44.284
Yeah.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.486
OK, bye.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.621
Are you finished
with that yet?

04:47.721 --> 04:49.289
Oh, jeez, you kids.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.124
Mom, I'm going over
to Cindy's house.

04:51.224 --> 04:53.494
And, Yes, I'll be back
in time for dinner.

04:53.594 --> 04:58.098
Oh goodie, that brainwashing
is kicking right in.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.500
Yoohoo, it's me!

04:59.600 --> 05:00.468
Hey, come on in, Crystal.

05:00.568 --> 05:01.369
Hey, Darlene.

05:01.469 --> 05:02.936
- Hey, Darlene.
- Hey, Crystal.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.137
Hey, Lon.
- Hi, Dan.

05:04.237 --> 05:07.040
Dan, his scout troop gave
him everything he needs.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.576
Oh, this will be a snap.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.177
You happen to be working
with the A, number one,

05:10.277 --> 05:12.713
super birdhouse
builder of all time.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.815
The legend continues.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.984
Why don't you and Deej go
in the garage and get set up.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.186
I'll get us some sodies.
Be out in a minute.

05:19.286 --> 05:20.421
OK.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.357
Lonnie, honey, be sure
to keep your jacket on.

05:23.457 --> 05:26.093
DJ, honey, be sure not
to go near the chainsaw.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.999
Well, Crystal, why don't you
and Lonnie stay for dinner?

05:32.099 --> 05:34.001
- Oh no, I couldn't impose.
- Oh, come on.

05:34.101 --> 05:34.902
You're not imposing.

05:35.002 --> 05:35.803
You're gonna cook.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.141
All right.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.075
OK, bye.

05:42.175 --> 05:42.976
Hi, Crystal.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.478
Hi, Sugar.

05:44.578 --> 05:45.913
I'll get that.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.518
Crystal, give me a hand
with these vegetables.

05:50.618 --> 05:53.454
OK, let me wash up.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.489
Don't you think Lonnie gets
to looking more and more

05:55.589 --> 05:57.391
like his daddy every day?

05:57.491 --> 05:59.226
Uhh, why don't you dice
up them carrots, Crystal?

05:59.326 --> 06:00.127
So

06:00.227 --> 06:01.128
How do you want them?

06:01.228 --> 06:03.864
Sliced, diced,
curled, or julienned?

06:03.964 --> 06:05.933
Uhh, cut them up in
little pieces, would ya?

06:09.069 --> 06:10.604
You know, ever
since Jackie gave me

06:10.704 --> 06:11.905
a ride to work
this morning I just

06:12.005 --> 06:13.541
can't get my mind off Sonny.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.008
You know you really
ought to start driving

06:15.108 --> 06:16.777
yourself to work, Crystal.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.646
Sonny was really
one in a million.

06:18.746 --> 06:19.547
Yeah.

06:19.647 --> 06:20.681
Yeah, he was a pretty good guy.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.182
He was the best.

06:22.282 --> 06:23.917
I keep wondering how
different my life would have

06:24.017 --> 06:26.153
turned out if he hadn't died.

06:26.253 --> 06:29.757
I could've been happy
for the rest of my life.

06:29.857 --> 06:30.658
Excuse me.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.296
Come here.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.137
What's that for?

06:44.237 --> 06:46.674
I was just thinking about how
different my life would have

06:46.774 --> 06:49.009
turned out if you'd have lived.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.619
I feel better now.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.254
I wish there was something
we could do for Crystal.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.491
She puts herself through
this every six months.

07:03.591 --> 07:04.658
She's still in
love with the guy

07:04.758 --> 07:06.393
and there's nothing
we could do about it.

07:06.494 --> 07:07.294
Leave it to me.

07:07.394 --> 07:08.896
I'll fix her up.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.998
You know what they say, the
best thing for an old love

07:11.098 --> 07:12.265
is a new love.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.367
That's beautiful, Dan.

07:14.468 --> 07:15.903
After you read that
did you eat the cookie?

07:19.707 --> 07:23.010
[music playing]

07:35.388 --> 07:37.124
What do you
think you're doing?

07:37.224 --> 07:39.560
What does it
look like Einstein?

07:39.660 --> 07:40.861
You're going to
die, you know that?

07:40.961 --> 07:42.530
From one cigarette?

07:42.630 --> 07:44.632
Yeah, Mom and dad
are going to kill you.

07:44.732 --> 07:45.833
They're not going to find out.

07:45.933 --> 07:46.900
They went to the budget sale.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.401
They'll be gone for days.

07:48.502 --> 07:49.803
Don't you even
care about the fact

07:49.903 --> 07:52.606
that your lungs are going to
turn brown and shrivel up?

07:52.706 --> 07:55.408
Not really.

07:55.509 --> 07:56.309
Oh my God!

07:56.409 --> 07:57.210
Mom and Dad are here!

07:57.310 --> 07:59.079
You're dead.

07:59.179 --> 08:02.616
The smell-- how are you
going to cover up the smell?

08:02.716 --> 08:04.852
That's spray starch you ditz!

08:04.952 --> 08:06.520
Here, use bug spray.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.521
[coughing]

08:07.621 --> 08:08.488
That's enough!

08:14.928 --> 08:17.264
It stinks in here!

08:17.364 --> 08:19.066
What is that smell?

08:19.166 --> 08:20.467
Bug spray.

08:20.568 --> 08:23.203
Darlene and I just
killed a huge spider.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.405
What did you do, drown it?

08:25.505 --> 08:26.740
We had to use the whole can.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.576
It was humongous.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.110
Well thank God we're safe.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.378
Now all we have
to worry about is

08:31.478 --> 08:34.447
irreversible chromosome damage.

08:34.548 --> 08:35.816
There's still
some bags out there.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.718
Will you two exterminators
go get them, please?

08:37.818 --> 08:40.754
- We'd love to.
- Was I right?

08:40.854 --> 08:41.755
Or was I right?

08:41.855 --> 08:43.624
Is this is a trick question?

08:43.724 --> 08:46.359
Admit it, that
was one great sale.

08:46.459 --> 08:48.361
Do you think 12
furnace filters

08:48.461 --> 08:50.030
is going to be enough there?

08:50.130 --> 08:54.334
Babe, 12 for $12.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.570
You're never going to see
prices like these again.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.138
Yeah, and as soon
as my back's turned

08:58.238 --> 09:01.875
you're filling up my cart
with all these tube socks.

09:01.975 --> 09:05.512
Well I didn't see you
holding back on the cold cream.

09:05.613 --> 09:06.446
Hey, I need that!

09:06.546 --> 09:07.347
Eight jars?

09:07.447 --> 09:08.248
Hey, give it to me.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.316
I use it to cook, see?

09:14.121 --> 09:15.989
What's in this, led?

09:16.089 --> 09:19.059
Oh, I got you
kids new leg irons.

09:19.159 --> 09:22.429
[maniacal laughter]

09:22.529 --> 09:24.765
- Hey, Dan, look!
- Hi, Crystal.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.734
I found a flag
for the birdhouse.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.168
No red blooded
American birdhouse

09:28.268 --> 09:29.469
should be without one.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.038
Well I'm going to go out
and start sanding roof, OK?

09:31.138 --> 09:32.105
OK.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.273
Oh, use that number
three sandpaper, OK?

09:33.373 --> 09:35.242
- OK?
- Well, I gotta get going.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.410
My Saturday is just jam packed.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.212
Whoa, you're in a good mood.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.580
Yes I am.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.550
I decided to treat myself to
a manicure and a wash and set.

09:43.651 --> 09:46.219
Wouldn't, perchance, have
to do with a certain new fella

09:46.319 --> 09:47.454
I fixed you up with, would it?

09:47.554 --> 09:49.256
Oh, Dan, now
stop your gloating

09:49.356 --> 09:50.290
so I can hear what happened.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.859
What happened?

09:51.959 --> 09:53.526
It was a lovely evening.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.696
He took me to a nice restaurant.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.799
A little Italian place with
the best pasta I ever had.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.033
Oh, now, skip the noodles.

10:00.133 --> 10:03.236
Let's get to the tomatoes here.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.806
Well the same thing
happened that always happens.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.575
I spent the entire evening
comparing him to Sonny,

10:08.676 --> 10:11.078
and I said to myself, I
can't do this anymore.

10:11.178 --> 10:12.312
See Roseanne?

10:12.412 --> 10:14.748
And you said a match
wouldn't make any difference.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.951
Oh but it did
make a difference.

10:18.051 --> 10:21.955
I decided not to go out
with men at all anymore.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.958
Well, Crystal, don't you
think that's a little bit nuts?

10:25.058 --> 10:26.326
No.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.663
What's nuts is bouncing from
one bad relationship to another.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.165
I don't need any man in my life.

10:32.265 --> 10:35.869
The only thing that makes me
happy are memories of Sonny.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.638
This is all the man I need.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.107
Crystal, you're wearing
your wedding ring.

10:40.207 --> 10:43.010
Yes I am, and there's
a practical side to this.

10:43.110 --> 10:46.513
This will keep men at bay and
keep Sonny close to my heart.

10:46.613 --> 10:49.149
Now, if you excuse me, I'm
gonna go get my 'do done.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.050
Bye bye.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.756
My god, the man's been
in a bridge for 12 years

10:55.856 --> 10:57.858
and she's wearing his ring.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.327
Yeah, I think she's
gone off the deep end.

11:00.427 --> 11:03.731
Jeez, we gotta tell her
the truth about Sonny.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.433
Yeah, I guess she
really ought to know.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.368
You know you
men are all alike.

11:08.468 --> 11:11.571
Either you're out running around
or you're buried in your work.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.908
[music playing]

11:16.409 --> 11:19.179
[humming]

11:23.817 --> 11:25.652
Jackie, we got anymore boxes?

11:25.753 --> 11:27.454
No, we're all out of them.

11:27.554 --> 11:28.856
Crystal, you better slow down.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.357
You're making me
and her look bad.

11:30.457 --> 11:31.759
I'll go get some.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.294
[humming]

11:34.394 --> 11:35.395
Day's almost over.

11:35.495 --> 11:36.696
I thought you would
talk to her about Sonny.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.598
- I'm going to.
- When?

11:38.698 --> 11:40.467
Well, I just gotta think
of what to say, you know?

11:40.567 --> 11:41.902
What's there to think about?

11:42.002 --> 11:43.503
You just tell her the truth.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.005
Yeah, I'm going to
go up to her-- somebody

11:45.105 --> 11:46.306
that's in a great mood--

11:46.406 --> 11:49.342
Uhh, Crystal, um, did you
know that your, uh, husband

11:49.442 --> 11:51.244
was the skirt junkie?

11:51.344 --> 11:53.313
Well you don't have
to be crude about it.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.615
You just-- you-- you
bring up the subject

11:55.715 --> 11:58.351
and then you let Crystal
make that discovery herself.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.486
Oh Yeah, like, uh--

11:59.586 --> 12:00.821
Crystal, hey, you know
that husband of yours?

12:00.921 --> 12:02.289
The one that's in the bridge?

12:02.389 --> 12:06.927
How many women beside
you you think he boinked?

12:07.027 --> 12:09.429
[humming]
- Here we go.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.336
Um, Crystal?

12:16.436 --> 12:17.237
Yes?

12:19.572 --> 12:20.808
I gotta talk to you.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.443
What about?

12:23.543 --> 12:24.344
About Sonny.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.378
What about it?

12:29.682 --> 12:31.351
Me and Jackie were
just saying that he was

12:31.451 --> 12:34.154
a great construction worker.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.688
Why, thank you guys.

12:35.789 --> 12:36.589
[humming]

12:36.689 --> 12:37.524
You're welcome.

12:37.624 --> 12:41.028
[music playing]

12:51.071 --> 12:52.439
DAN: Hey, babe?

12:52.539 --> 12:53.974
Check this out.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.408
Pretty neat, huh?

12:55.508 --> 12:57.777
Wow.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.948
Oh, where's the Jacuzzi?

13:01.048 --> 13:03.383
Right there next
to the wet bar.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.318
Wow you guys did a great job.

13:05.418 --> 13:06.319
Don't look at me.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.687
Big Lon' here did
most of the work.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.457
I just handed him
the tools and--

13:10.557 --> 13:11.825
You know this needs, Lonnie?

13:11.925 --> 13:12.960
What?

13:13.060 --> 13:15.295
You should paint this
little, tiny welcome mat

13:15.395 --> 13:17.030
right here by the door.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.798
Oh, yeah!

13:18.899 --> 13:20.667
Hey, Dan, can I borrow
some of your paint?

13:20.767 --> 13:21.601
Sure.

13:21.701 --> 13:22.502
Thanks!

13:22.602 --> 13:23.904
I'll be back in a minute.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.406
Yeah, just try to
keep DJ out of it, OK?

13:26.506 --> 13:28.275
OK, I'll try.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.278
Bye.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.113
That kid is aces.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.882
He is so cool.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.716
You talk to Crystal
yet about Sonny?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.451
Hmm, not yet.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.855
So you didn't do it yet, huh?

13:41.955 --> 13:44.357
Dan, look.

13:44.457 --> 13:47.027
Whose are those?

13:47.127 --> 13:52.132
Well they're in Darlene's
jeans, you figure it out.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.101
Well let's go
find Ms. Darlene--

13:54.201 --> 13:58.238
tie her little tail in a knot
and ground her for six months.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.973
No, no, no.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.175
Just follow my lead.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.978
Get some matches.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.780
Hey, Darlene, come
down here a minute.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.753
What did I do now?

14:13.853 --> 14:15.222
Nothing.

14:15.322 --> 14:16.556
I just found these
in your jeans,

14:16.656 --> 14:18.758
I thought you might
want them back.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.627
You're going to
kill me, aren't you?

14:20.727 --> 14:21.828
No!

14:21.929 --> 14:23.296
Your father and I just
want you to know you don't

14:23.396 --> 14:25.032
have to sneak around anymore.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.099
Yeah, honey.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.901
This is your house, too.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.570
You're welcome to smoke.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.706
Yeah right, and get
my face bashed in.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.208
No, we mean it.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.911
Why don't you go ahead and
light one up right now?

14:38.011 --> 14:38.811
Go on, take one.

14:41.714 --> 14:46.186
Here, let me light it for you.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.188
Is this going to
explode or something?

14:48.288 --> 14:49.689
No, no, no.

14:49.789 --> 14:50.623
It's going to explode.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.560
[laughs] We wouldn't
blow you up.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.428
We'd never get you
out of the furniture.

14:58.831 --> 15:01.368
Oh, look, she's
such an adult, honey.

15:01.468 --> 15:02.269
Aren't you

15:02.369 --> 15:04.972
Proud?

15:05.072 --> 15:08.308
Proud doesn't say it.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.210
So how come you're
letting me smoke?

15:10.310 --> 15:11.511
Because we love you.

15:11.611 --> 15:12.679
Right, honey?

15:12.779 --> 15:13.580
That's right.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.618
And then, you know what
the best part of her smoking

15:18.718 --> 15:19.519
is going to be?

15:19.619 --> 15:20.687
What's that, dear?

15:20.787 --> 15:23.523
Oh, when her teeth
start turning all yellow.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.026
Ooo, ooo, I can hardly wait.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.195
You know what I'm
waiting for though?

15:28.295 --> 15:30.330
What's that, Darlin'?

15:30.430 --> 15:31.431
Emphysema.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.333
Oooo.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.802
Oooo how cool!

15:35.902 --> 15:37.004
Wow.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.871
Oh, we might have one
problem with this though.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.007
Problem?

15:40.107 --> 15:41.975
Yeah, you know, that
darn iron lung-- getting

15:42.075 --> 15:43.110
it through the door there.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.248
We'll keep her in the garage.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.050
All right, I know what
you guys are trying to do.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.518
You're trying to
scare me, aren't you?

15:51.618 --> 15:52.885
Pretty much.

15:52.986 --> 15:55.222
You're going to keep ragging
on me 'till I quit smoking.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.623
Pretty much.

15:56.723 --> 15:57.790
OK.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.759
Mother, father, you're right.

15:59.859 --> 16:00.660
I was a fool.

16:00.760 --> 16:01.561
I'll never smoke again.

16:01.661 --> 16:02.729
Good.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.297
Now get out of here
before I crush your skull.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.769
[door knock]
- Yoohoo!

16:09.869 --> 16:10.803
It's me!
- Hey, Crystal.

16:10.903 --> 16:11.704
Hey.

16:11.804 --> 16:12.739
Hi.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.274
Is Lonnie about ready to go?

16:14.374 --> 16:17.410
Almost, he's out
finishing his birdhouse.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.479
Crystal, me and Dan
want to talk to you.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.481
Come and sit down
here for a minute.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.584
Well, good, because I
want to talk to you too.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.853
I was going through a
box of Sonny's clothes

16:26.953 --> 16:29.056
and I found this
photograph from that time

16:29.156 --> 16:31.658
we took that trip to
Meramec Caverns, remember?

16:31.758 --> 16:33.493
Yeah, we stopped off
outside of Belleville

16:33.593 --> 16:35.328
and had that picnic.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.597
And we bought those
purple snow cones.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.999
Oh, and we ate them in the
car and they made such a mess,

16:40.100 --> 16:40.900
and we had to--

16:46.873 --> 16:50.677
Crystal, you OK?

16:50.777 --> 16:53.946
Well, ever since Jackie
drove me over the bridge

16:54.047 --> 16:56.949
I've been thinking about
how things with me and Sonny

16:57.050 --> 16:59.519
weren't as perfect
as everybody thought.

16:59.619 --> 17:02.955
In fact, they weren't
perfect at all.

17:03.056 --> 17:05.692
Well, hell honey,
that's not your fault.

17:05.792 --> 17:08.228
But it is.

17:08.328 --> 17:12.132
I never told anybody
this but I had an affair

17:12.232 --> 17:13.366
while I was married to Sonny.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.438
I feel so guilty.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.972
I've been carrying
this around for years

17:20.073 --> 17:25.044
and no matter what I do I
just can't seem to let it go.

17:25.145 --> 17:28.248
Well, Crystal, you can't
beat yourself up about it.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.317
I cheated on him.

17:30.417 --> 17:33.786
Well, you've got to get over
this guilt stuff, Crystal.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.688
And you've got to
get over Sonny.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.124
You gotta go on with your life.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.658
That's what I'd like to do.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.094
Well, then that's
what you got to do.

17:41.194 --> 17:44.531
[music playing]

17:56.976 --> 17:58.878
I don't know if I can do this.

17:58.978 --> 18:00.813
Crystal, now, you
want to talk to him.

18:00.913 --> 18:04.151
Go ahead talk to him.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.619
You spent the last twelve
years feeling guilt.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.721
Yeah, you want to spend
the next 12 that way?

18:08.821 --> 18:09.989
No.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.724
Well then talk
to him, Crystal.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.025
Go on.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.661
Which one is he in?

18:14.761 --> 18:16.629
Uh, I think it's this one.

18:16.729 --> 18:19.699
Well, maybe it's that one.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.434
Uh, Crystal, I don't think
it makes any difference

18:21.534 --> 18:22.735
which one he's in.

18:22.835 --> 18:23.936
Just pick one and start talking.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.277
I feel kind of stupid.

18:30.377 --> 18:32.779
Just talk to him, Crystal.
Tell him that.

18:32.879 --> 18:33.813
Tell him anything.

18:33.913 --> 18:34.847
Yeah.

18:34.947 --> 18:35.748
I'll get you started.

18:43.890 --> 18:47.694
Sonny, it's me Dan.

18:51.331 --> 18:55.335
Uhh, Crystal-- I can't, it--

18:55.435 --> 18:56.236
He's your husband.

18:56.336 --> 18:59.038
I think you, uh--

18:59.138 --> 19:00.473
Go on, Crystal.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.454
Hi, honey.

19:14.554 --> 19:17.123
Everything's fine.

19:17.224 --> 19:21.228
I'm still working at
the plastics factory.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.296
You should see Lonnie.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.632
He's 11 now.

19:25.732 --> 19:29.168
He's got your dark hair,
and he's so handsome.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.903
Every time I look
at him, I see you.

19:33.906 --> 19:37.277
I miss you so much.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.746
There's not a day goes by
that I don't think about you.

19:42.982 --> 19:47.086
Sonny, there's something
I got to tell ya.

19:47.186 --> 19:51.258
I can't live with
the guilt anymore.

19:51.358 --> 19:55.262
While we were married
I had an affair.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.263
It was only one time.

19:59.232 --> 20:02.369
I don't know why I did it but,
damn it, I was so angry at you

20:02.469 --> 20:03.370
for running around on me.

20:06.539 --> 20:10.543
I knew about that waitress,
and them other women, too.

20:13.346 --> 20:18.518
It really hurt me because you're
the only man I ever loved,

20:18.618 --> 20:19.452
and I still do.

20:22.489 --> 20:28.027
But I got my own life to live,
so I got to let you go now.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.401
Well, I'm going to
get back in the truck

20:34.501 --> 20:35.702
because it's really
cold out here.

20:39.339 --> 20:42.208
Bye, Sonny.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.109
I love you.

[groaning]

21:06.933 --> 21:09.469
Think I caught my death,
a cold, at that bridge.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.971
Oh doggone-it, and I
didn't keep up on your life

21:12.071 --> 21:14.407
insurance premiums.

21:14.507 --> 21:17.377
That's OK, dear, I
left everything to you.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.612
Oh boy, I'm all set then.

21:19.712 --> 21:24.817
12 furnace filters and
18 pairs of tube sock.

21:24.917 --> 21:28.254
17 pairs, I want
to be buried in one.

21:28.355 --> 21:31.491
You got it.

21:31.591 --> 21:38.398
Baby, if I kick off will
you keep all my stuff?

21:38.498 --> 21:41.133
I am all your stuff.

21:41.233 --> 21:44.471
You my best stuff.

21:44.571 --> 21:47.807
