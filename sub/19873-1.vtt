HEY

Did you come?

02:38.525 --> 02:39.367
- A bit.

02:48.234 --> 02:49.372
- What's wrong?

02:51.771 --> 02:52.579
- I don't know.

02:52.639 --> 02:53.777
- Tell me the truth.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.410
- There's nothing.

02:58.845 --> 02:59.915
Don't start getting hyper.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.250
- I'm not getting hyper.

03:01.314 --> 03:02.884
I'm in love with you.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.394
You're over me.

03:42.522 --> 03:43.626
Say something.

03:47.327 --> 03:48.237
- Something.

03:48.294 --> 03:49.329
- Grow up.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.738
- I'm moving out.

03:51.931 --> 03:54.502
- I think you should.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.411
- I put a deposit on an
apartment.

03:59.672 --> 04:02.209
- I gotta go to work.

04:02.275 --> 04:03.811
- Dallas!

04:09.349 --> 04:11.761
- You're better off without me.

04:12.785 --> 04:13.991
- Why?

04:14.254 --> 04:15.961
- I'll call you later.

04:33.673 --> 04:36.017
- Hey sweetheart!

04:45.518 --> 04:49.557
Pass the keys, let me take it
for a ride.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.727
- I'd take her for a ride.

04:53.926 --> 04:56.770
- Hey, why do ladies love
roofers?

05:12.879 --> 05:16.417
- You should pick me up and go
like that.

05:57.924 --> 05:58.902
- Hey, babe.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.429
What time is it?

06:02.495 --> 06:03.633
-'L'lme to go.

06:03.696 --> 06:04.538
- Is it?

06:07.100 --> 06:08.101
I'm up.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.346
<i>- Just wait.</i>

06:26.552 --> 06:27.997
- What is this?

06:28.054 --> 06:29.362
- What?

06:29.422 --> 06:30.025
- What do you mean what,

06:30.089 --> 06:31.363
what is this?

06:31.424 --> 06:32.869
Did you paint my nails?

06:32.925 --> 06:34.495
- Mhmm.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.698
<i>. M'!-</i>

06:35.762 --> 06:37.605
- You have the most gorgeous
nail-beds.

06:37.663 --> 06:39.506
- I feel violated.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.101
- What?

06:41.167 --> 06:42.703
Why?

06:42.769 --> 06:44.771
- I don't know it's fucking
weird.

06:44.837 --> 06:45.679
Okay look baby I gotta go.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.046
Would you take that off please?

06:47.106 --> 06:48.084
- I just want one picture.

06:48.141 --> 06:51.122
- You're not taking a picture of
me.

07:15.701 --> 07:16.611
- Hello.

07:21.908 --> 07:22.943
Welcome back.

07:25.812 --> 07:26.688
- Fuck off.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.951
- Already drinking alone?

07:33.019 --> 07:33.895
- There's one left for you.

07:33.953 --> 07:34.897
Do you want one?

07:34.954 --> 07:35.796
- Yeah.

07:47.867 --> 07:48.572
- Where's your thing?

07:48.634 --> 07:51.513
Over there.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.949
Okay, what's u p?

07:54.807 --> 07:55.911
Talk to me.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.977
You just walked out on her'?

07:58.044 --> 07:58.886
- Kind of.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.023
I got better things to do.

08:02.081 --> 08:04.857
I don't wanna play house
right now

08:07.587 --> 08:09.794
- She wasn't right for you.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.536
- I'm buzzed.

08:17.597 --> 08:19.076
- I gotta catch up.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.009
- You won't catch up.

08:24.103 --> 08:26.208
No one will ever catch me.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.985
- What time is Claire coming
over'?

08:33.044 --> 08:35.183
- She's on her way.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.854
- I'll call you in the morning.

08:39.585 --> 08:41.724
- What's the time difference in
Arizona?

08:41.787 --> 08:42.765
- Two hours.

08:45.591 --> 08:48.094
- Call me when you get to the
hotel.

08:48.160 --> 08:51.266
- Do you think you'll be up that
late?

08:53.132 --> 08:53.974
- Probably not.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.070
I'm shooting tomorrow morning.

08:56.135 --> 08:58.741
- Don't try to keep up with
Claire.

08:58.804 --> 08:59.839
- I never do.

09:12.018 --> 09:12.996
- Hey, Dallas.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.156
- Yes, Joslyn.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.130
- When are you
picking up

09:15.187 --> 09:16.188
the rest of your stuff.

09:16.255 --> 09:17.666
- What stuff?

09:17.723 --> 09:18.895
- Stuff that you don't want
donated

09:18.958 --> 09:20.733
to goodwill with your
name and address on it.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.670
You have 20 minutes.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.207
Hmm, I can't be there in 20
minutes,

09:24.263 --> 09:27.107
I have a party to get to.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.201
Throw it out.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.306
Don't call me about this stuff
anymore.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.710
I wanna be amicable with you

09:33.773 --> 09:35.844
and phone calls of this
nature piss me off.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.182
You know me better

09:37.243 --> 09:40.156
than to think I give a shit
where my stuff ends up.

09:40.212 --> 09:42.214
- Even inanimate
objects are not safe from you.

09:42.281 --> 09:43.555
- Vvhat, fine.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.823
Stop calling, if you know that's
the case.

09:49.722 --> 09:51.702
- Buzz kill.

09:58.164 --> 10:03.164
- I bought a few new things.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.810
- I like to boil and recycle.

10:06.872 --> 10:09.079
- I'm starting over.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.272
You see anything?

10:29.328 --> 10:30.170
- Nothing.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.636
- Hot gins are never on time.

10:33.699 --> 10:34.803
What about us?

10:36.035 --> 10:37.105
- We're not hot gins.

10:37.169 --> 10:39.809
- I'm wearing women's clothing.

10:41.173 --> 10:42.709
- On the outside.

10:52.752 --> 10:56.222
- I'm calling firsts on the
bartender.

10:56.288 --> 10:58.290
- Too bad she likes me.

10:58.357 --> 11:00.894
- You can back off if I like a
gin.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.133
I've been after her for months.

11:03.195 --> 11:04.196
- You don't get it.

11:04.263 --> 11:06.265
- Maybe you don't get it.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.838
- I'm taking a lap.

11:12.271 --> 11:13.978
- You can handle it.

11:16.042 --> 11:17.214
- This is cute.

11:18.144 --> 11:19.851
- Where should we go first?

11:19.912 --> 11:21.289
- It's a girl paflY-

11:21.347 --> 11:22.655
- Let's keep walking.

11:22.715 --> 11:23.989
- We're going in.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.213
- What do you want to drink?

11:46.272 --> 11:47.182
- I'm okay.

11:48.274 --> 11:50.880
I'm going to find the bathroom.

11:57.883 --> 11:58.861
- Excuse me.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.696
She's ignoring me.

12:01.754 --> 12:03.290
- I'll be right back.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.833
- I think I'm being overlooked.

12:09.895 --> 12:10.873
<i>' L</i> 9m you.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.136
Desiree.

12:12.198 --> 12:13.734
What do you want?

12:35.888 --> 12:37.299
. HEY-

12:37.356 --> 12:38.198
. HEY-

12:45.030 --> 12:47.271
Were you on my street today?

12:48.901 --> 12:51.142
- Th ought you looked familiar.

12:51.203 --> 12:53.513
You come to gin parties often?

12:53.773 --> 12:55.275
- I don't come at all.

12:55.341 --> 12:56.786
- Terrible news.

12:58.010 --> 13:00.115
Can I change that for you?

13:01.881 --> 13:04.259
- My friend is waiting for me.

13:07.553 --> 13:09.226
- What's your name?

13:10.322 --> 13:11.164
- Jasmine.

13:16.862 --> 13:18.102
- Don't be rude.

13:21.967 --> 13:25.039
Dallas, named after the American

13:25.104 --> 13:26.515
television show my parents fell
in

13:26.572 --> 13:28.245
love within Sweden.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.116
- Did you grow up in Sweden?

13:30.176 --> 13:31.382
- What gave me away?

13:31.443 --> 13:33.480
Am I talking funny?

13:33.546 --> 13:35.423
- You're talking fine.

13:36.582 --> 13:37.560
I'm curious.

13:38.584 --> 13:39.426
- About?

13:42.388 --> 13:44.800
- Why do women love roofers?

13:46.992 --> 13:48.027
- You have to go out with me if
you

13:48.093 --> 13:49.401
want to find out.

13:53.599 --> 13:55.875
- I need to get some air.

14:04.109 --> 14:05.087
- What was that?

14:05.144 --> 14:06.316
<i>_</i> My ring.

14:06.378 --> 14:08.221
- Ouch, it's a weapon.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.556
You're engaged.

14:15.421 --> 14:16.832
My condolences.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.570
- Now you're being rude.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.605
- I'm just being honest.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.205
- See you.

14:33.906 --> 14:36.386
- Why do women love roofers?

14:36.442 --> 14:37.284
- No idea.

14:38.577 --> 14:41.057
- Because we strip'em
and nail'em all daylong.

14:41.113 --> 14:43.059
- Sounds exhausting.

14:43.115 --> 14:43.991
- I'll be on the same street
tomorrow,

14:44.049 --> 14:46.996
if you want a demonstration.

14:47.052 --> 14:47.928
- I'll pass.

14:47.987 --> 14:50.160
- Let me buy you a drink?

14:50.222 --> 14:51.530
- Pass again.

14:51.590 --> 14:52.398
- Wait.

14:52.458 --> 14:53.436
We're not done talking.

14:53.492 --> 14:55.529
- I left my friend alone.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.384
- Your friend found company.

15:46.045 --> 15:49.618
Has he been saving since
he was a little boy?

15:51.517 --> 15:54.088
- He's good with his finances.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.036
- I was almost engaged.

16:01.327 --> 16:04.570
I thought about buying a ring
for my ex.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.508
I even googled it.

16:10.536 --> 16:13.176
I got my own apartment instead.

16:16.342 --> 16:20.449
- Rile and I just moved
out of our first apartment.

16:25.651 --> 16:29.497
- How's the sex after
all the living together.

16:33.525 --> 16:34.503
- It's good.

16:36.228 --> 16:40.438
- I've got no emotional
stamina for intimacy.

16:40.499 --> 16:43.480
- I know how to keep him
interested.

16:56.115 --> 16:59.358
- I think I might be different
with you.

17:00.352 --> 17:01.524
- Keep saying that and you might
find

17:01.587 --> 17:02.759
the right gin.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.595
- What if you're the right gin?

17:12.564 --> 17:13.667
- I'm engaged.

18:16.228 --> 18:17.536
- Why are you being so
crazy!

18:17.596 --> 18:19.371
- Because I have to wake up
early.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.671
- We were having a good time.

18:20.732 --> 18:21.836
- At my expense.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.478
- What?

18:23.535 --> 18:26.573
- I should listen to my
instincts.

18:26.638 --> 18:27.480
- Jasmine!

18:30.509 --> 18:32.182
- What are you talking about?

18:32.244 --> 18:33.484
- She kissed me.

18:34.746 --> 18:36.316
- What did you do?

18:38.517 --> 18:39.723
- I kissed her back.

18:39.785 --> 18:40.627
- What?

18:43.555 --> 18:45.296
- I feel sick.

18:45.357 --> 18:46.335
- Did you like it?

18:46.391 --> 18:48.337
- Claire, I'm not answering
that.

18:48.393 --> 18:49.531
- I'm just curious.

18:49.595 --> 18:53.099
- Don't talk about that,
it's not about that.

18:53.165 --> 18:54.337
I feel weird.

18:54.399 --> 18:55.275
- Because you like her?

18:55.334 --> 18:56.540
- Because I'm engaged.

18:56.602 --> 18:57.637
- Oh please, Jasmine.

18:57.703 --> 18:59.444
You're the most faithful person
I know.

18:59.505 --> 19:03.317
You and Rile are like Mary
and the fuckin carpenter.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.651
- It will never happen again.

19:11.416 --> 19:12.326
- Giddy-UP-

19:13.652 --> 19:15.495
- What time you done?

19:38.777 --> 19:39.778
- Rile?

19:39.845 --> 19:42.883
- Hey, I just got to the
hotel.

19:46.652 --> 19:50.600
- I want to get married in
the garden, at the Old Mill.

19:50.656 --> 19:51.862
<i>_</i> okay baby.

19:51.924 --> 19:52.868
Okay that's great.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.461
Call the planner in the morning.

19:54.526 --> 19:55.630
I'm red-eyed.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.867
I got to go sleep.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.375
- K, I love you.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.475
- I love you.

21:16.475 --> 21:17.510
- I'm coming!

21:28.654 --> 21:29.632
- I'm awake.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.496
- Hey, I gotta get to work.

21:34.893 --> 21:37.601
- I have stuff to do too.

21:37.663 --> 21:40.507
- Cool, I'm leaving the spare
key.

21:41.433 --> 21:42.741
You'll probably see Quinn before

21:42.801 --> 21:44.280
you see me again.

21:44.336 --> 21:45.474
Just give it to her.

21:45.537 --> 21:46.345
- Actually, can you just give

21:46.405 --> 21:47.008
me a ride.

21:47.072 --> 21:48.312
<i>_ I</i> gotta g0-

26:53.845 --> 26:54.687
- Morning.

26:55.747 --> 26:58.227
- You didn't say
goodbye last night.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.661
- I'm late for work.

27:00.719 --> 27:01.629
- What do you do?

27:01.686 --> 27:03.290
- I work in fashion.

27:03.355 --> 27:04.197
- Retail?

27:05.690 --> 27:08.728
- I'm an editor for
a fashion magazine.

27:08.793 --> 27:12.070
- Does that mean
you're the boss?

27:12.130 --> 27:15.771
- It's more complicated
than that.

27:15.834 --> 27:17.279
- I'm the boss.

27:17.335 --> 27:18.939
This is my company.

27:19.004 --> 27:19.846
My site.

27:43.294 --> 27:45.365
What are you doing later?

27:47.265 --> 27:48.869
- I'm working late.

27:49.834 --> 27:53.805
- I'll be here until dark
finishing upthis job.

27:55.407 --> 27:56.909
- Cool.

27:56.975 --> 28:01.014
- I'll be done and you'll
never have to see me again.

28:02.981 --> 28:03.823
- Bye.

28:17.262 --> 28:19.139
I want her nude on top.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.343
- She wants you nude on top.

28:23.401 --> 28:24.937
- Is that fur?

28:25.003 --> 28:26.038
- There is no way I will ever
put

28:26.104 --> 28:27.777
that on my naked body, it's in
m)'

28:27.839 --> 28:28.749
contract, no fur.

28:28.807 --> 28:30.286
- I'm an anti-fur advocate.

28:30.341 --> 28:32.014
Why is there a fur coat on your
set?

28:32.077 --> 28:32.953
- You think that's real?

28:33.011 --> 28:34.012
- It looks real.

28:34.079 --> 28:35.353
Even if it's not I'm not putting
it on.

28:35.413 --> 28:39.293
- The coat is faux, it wouldn't
be on my set otherwise.

28:41.086 --> 28:42.326
- Was that true?

28:44.189 --> 28:45.862
- It worked.

28:45.924 --> 28:47.733
I want to be home before dark.

28:47.792 --> 28:49.169
- I'll wrap it up.

29:26.898 --> 29:28.343
- You change your mind?

29:28.399 --> 29:29.844
- One drink, one.

29:29.901 --> 29:31.505
And we're done.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.875
- I'll be back in an hour.

30:05.436 --> 30:07.279
You trying to kill me?

30:11.009 --> 30:12.113
- Nice outfit.

30:25.423 --> 30:26.231
Thanks.

30:31.029 --> 30:32.406
Stop it.

30:32.463 --> 30:33.271
- Stop what?

30:33.331 --> 30:34.571
- You're staring at me.

30:34.833 --> 30:35.470
- I'm not.

30:43.274 --> 30:44.082
You were saying that you're a

30:44.142 --> 30:46.179
brilliant fashion editor.

30:47.579 --> 30:49.354
- I never said that.

30:49.414 --> 30:51.394
- Tell me what you said?

30:57.388 --> 31:00.096
- I had an opportunity to go to
New York.

31:00.158 --> 31:01.933
- What happened?

31:01.993 --> 31:03.870
- Rile hadjust been promoted.

31:03.928 --> 31:04.565
- So.

31:06.064 --> 31:07.839
- I made a sacrifice.

31:09.234 --> 31:11.612
- Sounds like martyrdom to me.

31:14.973 --> 31:17.249
- You'll understand someday.

31:18.409 --> 31:20.855
- Don't be condescending,

31:20.912 --> 31:24.086
I understand the concept of
sacrifice.

31:25.183 --> 31:28.062
I would have made you go, in
fact I

31:30.054 --> 31:32.056
would have gone with you.

31:47.205 --> 31:48.343
- That's sweet.

31:51.175 --> 31:52.882
You're really sweet.

31:56.047 --> 31:58.425
I like your style.

32:00.618 --> 32:04.031
I like your edge.

32:08.326 --> 32:12.035
It's just that my style
is engaged to a man.

32:12.964 --> 32:14.466
Can we get the bill?

32:16.434 --> 32:18.277
Don't come any closer.

32:19.537 --> 32:21.175
- Come to my place.

32:29.714 --> 32:31.022
- I'm leaving.

32:46.364 --> 32:47.502
- Stop torturing yourself.

32:47.565 --> 32:49.476
- You are torturing me.

34:31.335 --> 34:32.712
Take me somewhere.

36:18.609 --> 36:20.885
- You want me to take it off?

40:43.040 --> 40:43.916
- Hello.

40:43.974 --> 40:45.180
- Jasmine?

40:45.443 --> 40:46.683
You sleeping?

40:46.744 --> 40:50.419
- No, no, I'm awake, I
dazed off for a few minutes.

40:52.883 --> 40:55.090
- Did you call the planner
about booking the wedding?

40:55.152 --> 40:57.029
- I haven't had time.

40:57.087 --> 40:59.693
- I'll take care of
it.

40:59.757 --> 41:01.600
I'll call her before my
meeting this morning.

41:01.659 --> 41:04.640
The storm is really bad here.

41:04.695 --> 41:07.699
I guess I'm not golfing this
weekend.

41:08.966 --> 41:09.774
Hello?

41:09.834 --> 41:10.812
. 50m'-

41:10.868 --> 41:13.439
- Are you okay sweetie?

41:13.504 --> 41:15.575
- Bridget and I are working.

41:15.639 --> 41:17.482
We had some work to do.

41:17.541 --> 41:19.020
She just got here.

41:19.076 --> 41:22.853
- Okay you're
busy, say hello for me.

41:22.913 --> 41:26.884
Try to take some time for
you rselfthis weekend.

41:30.087 --> 41:32.033
- I should get going.

41:32.089 --> 41:34.194
- Me too, love you.

41:47.905 --> 41:48.747
- Morning.

42:00.584 --> 42:01.562
- Is it you?

42:02.987 --> 42:03.829
- It's me.

42:07.258 --> 42:08.794
- You're persistent.

42:08.859 --> 42:10.566
Look at you pushing.

42:11.729 --> 42:13.731
- I gave myself a hernia.

42:13.797 --> 42:16.141
My mom said if I acted like a
girl,

42:16.200 --> 42:18.942
I wouldn't get hurt all the
time.

42:20.037 --> 42:22.210
- Did you want to be a boy?

42:23.874 --> 42:26.650
- I just unwanted her to let me
be.

42:29.079 --> 42:30.524
- Can I have it?

42:31.248 --> 42:33.922
- Where will you keep it?

42:33.984 --> 42:37.056
- I'm going to flame it and
admire it

42:41.058 --> 42:43.766
and all of your tomboy strength.

42:46.864 --> 42:47.706
- Tomboy.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.072
I didn't like being called
thatvmen I was a kid.

42:53.137 --> 42:55.947
I couldn't hide it, but
I just didn't like being

42:56.006 --> 42:57.644
called out on it.

42:57.708 --> 43:00.052
Besides, I'm not a tomboy

43:00.110 --> 43:02.181
I'm more legit than that.

43:04.114 --> 43:05.855
- Okay, legit tomboy.

43:10.254 --> 43:11.096
Kiss me.

43:19.597 --> 43:22.976
I've never done anything like
this before.

43:29.139 --> 43:33.246
- I don't usually
tell the truth about my past.

43:36.046 --> 43:39.823
- Because you
have so much to hide.

43:43.387 --> 43:47.096
- I'm not
hiding anything from you.

43:59.403 --> 44:03.180
- What did your mom say
when you became a roofer?

44:03.240 --> 44:05.811
- She's pissed about it.

44:05.876 --> 44:07.822
She pushed me to leave
Sweden for university

44:07.878 --> 44:08.913
because she didn't want me
working

44:08.979 --> 44:10.822
on a roof with my dad.

44:14.718 --> 44:15.628
My dad used to tell me I
couldn't

44:15.686 --> 44:17.359
go up on any roofs without him.

44:17.421 --> 44:21.096
Fuck that, he didn't
even have to teach me.

44:22.026 --> 44:25.997
It's like I was born with
suction cups for feet.

44:28.198 --> 44:29.905
I hated being a kid.

44:31.435 --> 44:34.939
- I'm holding you to one
positive memory.

44:36.940 --> 44:40.080
- I liked helping my dad build
stuff.

44:40.144 --> 44:41.748
I liked the rain, even though I

44:41.812 --> 44:44.053
wasn't allowed to play in it.

44:44.114 --> 44:46.287
My mom's cooking and that she
used to

44:46.350 --> 44:49.729
iron my underwear into perfect
squares.

45:03.734 --> 45:06.340
- What was it like for you?

45:06.403 --> 45:10.715
- My dad made us laugh all the
time, he's witty and silly.

45:12.009 --> 45:15.889
My mom is supportive,
as long as she approves.

45:19.416 --> 45:21.362
When I was a teenager I had a

45:21.418 --> 45:24.228
summer thing with a girl named
Denise.

45:24.288 --> 45:26.461
- That doesn't surprise me.

45:27.891 --> 45:29.837
- You remind me of her.

45:31.895 --> 45:34.876
We were inseparable, we kissed
once.

45:37.301 --> 45:40.180
It lasted like four seconds.

45:40.237 --> 45:42.717
My mom walked in and freaked.

45:44.208 --> 45:46.916
I wasn't allowed to say goodbye.

45:48.011 --> 45:50.491
I never saw here again.

45:50.748 --> 45:52.125
- You just obeyed?

45:53.317 --> 45:54.295
- Of course.

45:56.286 --> 46:00.200
It took me a long time to
forgive my mom.

46:00.257 --> 46:02.999
I pretended everything was fine.

46:05.062 --> 46:06.370
She tried to hook me up with
anyone

46:06.430 --> 46:08.307
with a penis and a job.

46:13.504 --> 46:15.074
I stopped thinking about that
part

46:15.139 --> 46:18.882
of me and just followed
what was prescribed.

46:20.811 --> 46:22.313
I buried that story.

46:23.947 --> 46:26.518
It's like it never even
happened.

46:31.021 --> 46:33.228
How old were you when you came
out?

46:33.290 --> 46:34.132
- Young.

46:36.360 --> 46:37.202
- Young?

46:39.296 --> 46:40.798
How old is young?

46:41.899 --> 46:44.812
- I don't tell my coming out
story.

46:46.036 --> 46:48.539
- You're seriously not going to
tell me?

46:48.806 --> 46:51.047
- Why do I have to have one?

46:52.276 --> 46:54.517
- I promise not to tell
anyone you have one.

46:54.578 --> 46:56.854
And I'll never ask again.

46:59.016 --> 47:01.394
- Which story do you want

47:01.451 --> 47:03.328
it's not one that ever ends.

47:03.387 --> 47:06.095
Last month I came out
to the forklift operator

47:06.156 --> 47:08.397
at the roofing supply store.

47:10.060 --> 47:13.007
- The first time you were with a
woman.

47:13.063 --> 47:15.134
- It wasn't a surprise or
anything.

47:15.199 --> 47:18.146
I was only ever attracted to
women.

47:20.904 --> 47:22.178
- You never got the fearful
flooding

47:22.239 --> 47:23.445
rush that things might be
different

47:23.507 --> 47:24.349
for you?

47:27.578 --> 47:29.956
- Every time I look at you.

47:34.451 --> 47:35.555
- I'm waiting.

47:43.961 --> 47:47.204
You have until the sand runs out
or

47:47.264 --> 47:49.437
I won't see you ever again.

47:51.034 --> 47:53.275
- Guess I'll see you around.

47:55.239 --> 47:56.912
It's not that exciting.

47:56.974 --> 47:59.420
The first time a girl had sex
with me.

47:59.476 --> 48:00.887
She topped the fuck out of me
until

48:00.944 --> 48:02.082
seven in the morning.

48:02.145 --> 48:04.022
I didn't know what I was doing.

48:04.081 --> 48:06.186
- How things have changed.

48:09.186 --> 48:11.257
- I was only 16.

48:11.321 --> 48:13.597
She was like 30 or something.

48:15.392 --> 48:19.863
We both got what we
wanted and that's that.

48:19.930 --> 48:22.240
- How did your parents react?

48:24.601 --> 48:28.139
- My dad says he can't control
who I love.

48:29.172 --> 48:32.949
I always wanted them to
love each other more.

48:44.655 --> 48:46.965
I don't want to loose you.

53:32.909 --> 53:34.411
I cannot breathe.

54:08.478 --> 54:09.752
You're so pretty.

54:27.530 --> 54:29.009
I want you to stay.

54:30.467 --> 54:31.673
- Shh, be quiet.

54:33.536 --> 54:37.313
I could eat blueberry
pancakes at every meal.

54:39.843 --> 54:43.381
I'm going to starve to death in
your bed.

54:45.949 --> 54:48.987
- I'm going to build a
fortress.

54:49.052 --> 54:51.430
- I'll visit you.

54:52.989 --> 54:56.766
- I'm memorizing
every pan of you.

54:56.826 --> 54:59.466
- I don't want
to think about my life.

54:59.529 --> 55:00.507
The outside.

55:01.798 --> 55:03.573
Have you ever tried to
count how many breaths

55:03.633 --> 55:05.408
you take in a minute?

55:06.670 --> 55:07.876
- I tried,

55:07.937 --> 55:09.314
I stopped breathing.

55:09.372 --> 55:12.319
- It takes your breath
away.

55:12.375 --> 55:14.912
- I don't like
goodbyes.

55:16.012 --> 55:18.925
- Will you drive me
home?

55:20.784 --> 55:23.765
- I'm going to get us
lost.

55:41.071 --> 55:42.778
- I love this house.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.046
- I know you do.

55:48.645 --> 55:51.353
- Look, that's my favorite tree.

55:53.083 --> 55:54.084
- Where?

55:54.351 --> 55:55.762
- There.

55:55.819 --> 55:57.321
- I don't see it.

56:01.491 --> 56:04.335
That sad and lonely looking
thing?

56:04.394 --> 56:06.465
It needs to be cut off.

56:06.529 --> 56:09.100
I can bring my chainsaw over for
you.

56:09.366 --> 56:10.640
- Don't you dare.

56:11.801 --> 56:14.441
- Don't ever fuckin do that
again.

56:14.504 --> 56:16.984
- It was supposed to be frisky.

56:19.909 --> 56:20.887
- Kidding.

56:20.944 --> 56:21.786
Frisky?

56:37.427 --> 56:39.600
- I'm going in now.

56:39.662 --> 56:40.868
- Hit me.

56:40.930 --> 56:41.772
- What?

56:43.099 --> 56:44.043
- Do it again.

56:44.100 --> 56:45.670
Or I'll do it back.

56:45.735 --> 56:46.907
- You wouldn't?

57:02.018 --> 57:02.860
That hurt.

57:05.555 --> 57:06.397
- Do it.

57:41.825 --> 57:43.202
I want to see you tomorrow.

57:43.460 --> 57:48.773
- I can't. he'll be home
tomorrow morning.

57:49.466 --> 57:51.844
I can't see you again, Dallas.

57:57.207 --> 57:59.619
Hi it's Jasmine leave me a
message.

57:59.676 --> 58:02.520
- Hey, you might be asleep by
now.

58:03.913 --> 58:05.221
I called you eanier to let you
know

58:05.482 --> 58:06.654
our golf game got rained out

58:06.716 --> 58:09.219
- I'm coming home, no point in
sticking around.

58:09.986 --> 58:12.557
- I'll wait for a cab. I'll see
you soon.

58:12.622 --> 58:14.192
- Don't get me going.

58:38.715 --> 58:40.922
- Get out and play with me.

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:06.105
- Not in here.

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:06.232
- I want to see you again.

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:14.845
- I can't.

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:28.012
Rile, stop!

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:31.885
- What the fuck.

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:34.319
What the fuck did I do to you?

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:38.182
Don't touch me. Don't you
fucking touch me.

01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:29.207
You didn't even see me,

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.408
standing there,

01:04:31.467 --> 01:04:32.309
<i>W“ inst,</i>

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:35.207
you were gone.

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:39.885
- She's a woman.

01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:43.117
- It doesn't matter.

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:06.106
- Tell me what I need to do to
fix

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:08.444
this to put us back on track.

01:05:11.173 --> 01:05:12.584
- You're a lesbian.

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:17.655
- You've known me for
six almost seven years.

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:19.951
- I thought I did.

01:05:20.016 --> 01:05:20.960
- I still love you.

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:22.997
Nothing has changed between us.

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:25.293
- I saw it with my own eyes.

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:29.130
- I can't lose you.

01:05:31.994 --> 01:05:32.631
- End it.

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:35.333
- It's over.

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:38.470
- In person or you'll never see
me again.

01:05:38.534 --> 01:05:40.241
- Can I shower and go over to
her

01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:41.111
place before work?

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:42.012
I'm a mess.

01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:44.642
- You want to look good for her?

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:47.178
Come on let's go.

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:52.017
- I'll do it.

01:06:40.396 --> 01:06:42.376
I'm so sorry I left you.

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:48.647
I had to run after him.

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:11.036
Rile's outside waiting.

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:13.437
- Why?

01:07:22.671 --> 01:07:24.446
- I need to end this.

01:07:48.397 --> 01:07:49.637
I don't want to.

01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:53.705
- You have to.

01:08:00.776 --> 01:08:04.349
I shouldn't have put you in this
position.

01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:14.326
- I wanted it, I still do.

01:08:28.703 --> 01:08:31.207
- I don't want you like this.

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:48.402
- Because you can't be in
something.

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:51.435
- Jasmine!

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:01.205
What kind of something would
this be?

01:09:04.372 --> 01:09:05.783
You're wearing an engagement
ring that someone else

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:06.683
gave you.

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:50.587
