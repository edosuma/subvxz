WEBVTT

00:03.699 --> 00:07.355
Dr. Marcel exemplifies
the selfless dedication

00:07.355 --> 00:09.313
we here at Gaffney
pride ourselves on.

00:09.313 --> 00:12.577
Confident, creative--
future of medicine, this guy.

00:12.577 --> 00:14.101
<i>Do you ever wonder
what it would have been like</i>

00:14.101 --> 00:16.451
<i>if they haven't made us
put Vanessa up for adoption?</i>

00:16.451 --> 00:17.843
<i>And I made it
very clear to Grant</i>

00:17.843 --> 00:21.151
that I am not interested
in reconnecting with him.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.500
You felt the need
to tell him that?

00:22.500 --> 00:24.198
I didn't want there
to be any confusion.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.071
<i>Samir offered me
a spot on his team.</i>

00:28.071 --> 00:29.246
In the Philippines?

00:29.246 --> 00:30.508
This is my calling.

00:32.641 --> 00:34.512
- It's been a while.
- 15 years.

00:34.512 --> 00:36.297
Do you have anything
that you want to say

00:36.297 --> 00:37.428
to me after all this time?

00:37.428 --> 00:39.822
I'd like to try my best
to listen.

00:41.693 --> 00:42.738
No, come on.

00:42.738 --> 00:43.913
Come on.

00:43.913 --> 00:45.175
That's what I'm talking about.

00:45.175 --> 00:46.959
- Morning, Ethan.
- Morning, Hannah.

00:46.959 --> 00:48.700
Hey, I'm gonna
hit the showers.

00:48.700 --> 00:49.962
I'll grab you a juice.

00:49.962 --> 00:51.268
Thanks.

00:51.268 --> 00:53.227
You two seem
to be getting along.

00:53.227 --> 00:55.055
Ah, it's not like that.
We're just friends.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.534
If you say so.

00:56.534 --> 00:59.059
What about you?
How are things with April?

00:59.059 --> 01:02.366
Mm, to be honest, it's much
easier the second time around.

01:02.366 --> 01:05.413
It's like we got all the
big arguments out of the way.

01:05.413 --> 01:07.197
- That's great.
- Yeah.

01:07.197 --> 01:09.243
You know, it turns out,
we were walking down

01:09.243 --> 01:12.072
the same path this entire time
and just didn't know it.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.378
I think with Hannah and I,
our, uh,

01:14.378 --> 01:16.032
our paths diverged
a long time ago.

01:16.032 --> 01:17.990
Well, at least
you got someone

01:17.990 --> 01:19.383
to spot you in the gym.

01:23.257 --> 01:25.389
Zach, you've got incoming.

01:25.389 --> 01:26.477
You're going
to treatment three.

01:26.477 --> 01:27.565
Okay.

01:27.565 --> 01:30.090
Dr. Charles,
I don't seem to have

01:30.090 --> 01:31.178
an attending at the moment.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.005
Do you mind looking after Zach?

01:33.005 --> 01:35.225
Uh, sure.

01:35.225 --> 01:37.358
Cesar, talk to me.
You're going to three.

01:37.358 --> 01:39.664
Renee Chapman, 50 years old.
Neighbors called it in.

01:39.664 --> 01:41.971
Said she fell trying
to scale a fence.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.146
Husband's on his way.

01:43.146 --> 01:46.236
BP 120/80, heart rate 72.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.673
She's experiencing
some mild confusion.

01:48.673 --> 01:51.198
GCS 14
with a possible head injury.

01:54.592 --> 01:56.725
- Whoa, what is this?
- Not my fault.

01:56.725 --> 01:58.509
Talk to whoever's
in charge of scrubs.

01:58.509 --> 01:59.510
Zach.

02:02.513 --> 02:04.036
There are no scrubs here.

02:04.036 --> 02:05.516
We're completely wiped out.

02:05.516 --> 02:07.083
At least we still have
patient gowns.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.824
Well, what are we supposed
to do about surgeries?

02:08.824 --> 02:10.042
There's no way to maintain

02:10.042 --> 02:11.435
a sterile environment
in street clothes.

02:11.435 --> 02:12.784
Well,
Goodwin's working on it.

02:12.784 --> 02:14.134
Meanwhile,
we're gonna have to make do

02:14.134 --> 02:15.570
with what we've got.
- What about us?

02:15.570 --> 02:17.441
I can't see patients
dressed like this.

02:17.441 --> 02:18.877
Mags, this isn't
gonna cut it.

02:18.877 --> 02:20.749
What do you want me to do,
knit you a sweater?

02:20.749 --> 02:23.099
Maybe I've got a change
of clothes in my car.

02:23.099 --> 02:25.710
Actually, why don't we hit
the hospital thrift store?

02:25.710 --> 02:27.190
Maybe we'll find
something presentable.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.757
That's fine,
but make it fast.

02:28.757 --> 02:31.194
I want the rest of you
back in the ED now.

02:31.194 --> 02:33.022
- Seriously?
- Yes, and no complaints.

02:33.022 --> 02:35.155
I'm already short a doctor
with Vanessa gone.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.943
Okay, Ms. Chapman.

02:40.943 --> 02:44.164
Good news is,
your chest X-ray looks clear.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.948
No rib fractures.

02:45.948 --> 02:48.037
If it's okay with you, I would
like to send you for a head CT

02:48.037 --> 02:49.386
just to be on the safe side.

02:49.386 --> 02:50.692
Would you mind calling
Radiology to let them know

02:50.692 --> 02:51.823
we're on our way?

02:51.823 --> 02:53.347
Oh.

02:53.347 --> 02:55.131
I want it out of me.

02:55.131 --> 02:56.219
Oh!

02:56.219 --> 02:57.394
You want what out of you?

02:57.394 --> 02:59.004
Oh, where's Dr. Blake?

02:59.004 --> 03:00.963
You know, Dr. Blake doesn't
actually work here anymore--

03:00.963 --> 03:02.573
I want it out of me!

03:02.573 --> 03:04.009
What do you want out of you?
What do you want out of you?

03:04.009 --> 03:05.359
- It's not mine. Get it--ahh!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:05.359 --> 03:06.621
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh, God.

03:06.621 --> 03:08.231
- A little help here?
- Get it out of me!

03:08.231 --> 03:10.320
Get it out of me!

03:10.320 --> 03:12.235
Ah!
- Hank, 5 of Haldol now.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.715
Now.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.847
Get it out!

03:26.162 --> 03:28.817
Here, you can see the areas
of white starting to clear.

03:28.817 --> 03:31.123
I take it
that's a good thing?

03:31.123 --> 03:33.300
I'd still like to do
a follow-up chest CT,

03:33.300 --> 03:36.607
but I think your body is
taking well to the new lungs.

03:36.607 --> 03:38.348
Any questions?
- Yeah.

03:38.348 --> 03:39.828
What is going on here?

03:39.828 --> 03:41.525
What do you mean?

03:41.525 --> 03:44.006
Well, you're dressed
like one of my engineers.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.703
Believe it or not,
we're out of scrubs.

03:45.703 --> 03:47.879
So, uh, what,
somebody screwed up?

03:47.879 --> 03:49.794
Laundry issue.

03:49.794 --> 03:52.232
Every time you think
it can't get worse.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.799
I'm sorry, they need me
downstairs in the ED.

03:54.799 --> 03:55.844
I'll check back soon, okay?

03:55.844 --> 03:57.454
- Thank you, Dr. Marcel.
- You bet.

03:57.454 --> 04:00.109
Jack. Okay.

04:00.109 --> 04:01.676
- Crockett.
- Yeah.

04:01.676 --> 04:03.634
We need to talk
about Baltimore.

04:03.634 --> 04:04.940
Baltimore?

04:04.940 --> 04:06.246
Wait, the transplant
conference?

04:06.246 --> 04:09.249
Mm-hmm.
They had a keynote drop.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.207
You might want to throw
together some slides.

04:11.207 --> 04:13.905
- What's the topic?
- Ischemic preconditioning.

04:13.905 --> 04:16.168
- Wait, that's--
- Pamela Blake.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.953
Apparently, she had a setback.

04:17.953 --> 04:21.696
Took a leave so
she could return to rehab.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.001
Lucky you.

04:28.746 --> 04:32.707
How come I don't see any
scrubs coming off this truck?

04:32.707 --> 04:35.275
There was an electrical short
in the Cicero plant last night.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.624
Took out a whole bank
of dryers.

04:36.624 --> 04:39.366
But I thought we had backups
in the warehouse.

04:39.366 --> 04:40.889
I don't have
any drivers available.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.499
You know something?

04:42.499 --> 04:46.373
You are a veritable laundry
list of excuses today, Harry.

04:46.373 --> 04:49.332
I know that we are
in the process of negotiating

04:49.332 --> 04:51.682
our new service contract,
but please,

04:51.682 --> 04:55.686
please tell me you're not
holding my scrubs hostage.

04:55.686 --> 04:59.473
Ms. Goodwin, maybe you
should go talk to your CFO.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.349
For a thrift store,
I didn't do so bad.

05:06.349 --> 05:08.786
I don't know.
I feel like a bank teller.

05:08.786 --> 05:10.397
No.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.050
I'd say more like
a substitute teacher.

05:12.050 --> 05:13.965
Oh, okay, this is ridiculous.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.619
I'm changing back
into my workout clothes.

05:15.619 --> 05:17.926
Help! Help!

05:17.926 --> 05:19.406
What's going on?
We're doctors.

05:19.406 --> 05:20.972
She's having a baby.

05:22.713 --> 05:23.845
Hey, what's your name?

05:23.845 --> 05:25.499
Maya Safro.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.196
Hi, I'm Dr. Halstead.

05:27.196 --> 05:29.677
Is it okay if I remove this?

05:29.677 --> 05:32.244
Okay, mind if I
check you out?

05:32.244 --> 05:34.290
Okay, what's your due date,
Maya?

05:34.290 --> 05:36.205
Two weeks around Thanksgiving.

05:36.205 --> 05:37.424
This is your first baby?

05:37.424 --> 05:38.903
Yes. Oh.

05:38.903 --> 05:40.427
Deep breaths.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.342
We'll get you inside
so we can take a look at you.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.082
- Are you the father?
- I'm her neighbor.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.171
She called me for a ride
when her water broke.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.523
- Here we go.
- Let me help.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.918
She stabbed herself?
Oh, my God.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.311
Fortunately, we were able
to restrain her

05:55.311 --> 05:57.487
before she did any real damage.

05:57.487 --> 05:58.706
Mr. Chapman.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.316
Dr. Marcel.

06:00.316 --> 06:02.536
I assisted Dr. Blake
on Renee's kidney transplant.

06:02.536 --> 06:04.538
Oh, of course. I remember.

06:04.538 --> 06:06.104
Where's Dr. Blake?

06:06.104 --> 06:08.846
Unfortunately, she's moved
on, taking a new position.

06:08.846 --> 06:10.195
What do we know?

06:10.195 --> 06:11.849
Seems like Renee
experienced some kind

06:11.849 --> 06:13.721
of paranoid delirium.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.810
What, like a psychosis?

06:15.810 --> 06:17.159
Mm-hmm, of sorts. Yeah.

06:17.159 --> 06:18.595
Well, this is not
like her at all.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.162
I mean, you can ask Dr. Marcel.

06:20.162 --> 06:23.644
She has such an ordered mind.

06:23.644 --> 06:25.428
Mathematician, right?

06:25.428 --> 06:27.648
Yeah, top of her field,
fluids and mechanics.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.780
In fact, she's being awarded
the Abel Prize

06:29.780 --> 06:31.391
in Oslo next month.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.827
Wow.

06:32.827 --> 06:34.916
Seth, can you think
of any changes

06:34.916 --> 06:37.745
to her behavior
in the last few months?

06:37.745 --> 06:39.094
Yeah.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.530
It started, like,
about a month ago.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.402
She was confused, agitated.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.360
Huh.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.622
Hey, Zach.

06:45.622 --> 06:47.581
Did you include
a complete metabolic panel?

06:47.581 --> 06:49.670
Let's also make sure
we get that head CT too.

06:49.670 --> 06:50.975
Yes, sir.

06:50.975 --> 06:52.673
Hey, she's gonna
be all right, right?

06:52.673 --> 06:54.022
Look, we're absolutely gonna

06:54.022 --> 06:55.415
get to the bottom of this,
all right?

06:55.415 --> 06:57.329
Probably just a good idea
to wait for some

06:57.329 --> 07:00.071
of these test results before
we start looking at next steps.

07:03.161 --> 07:05.816
Any pregnancy complications
we should know about?

07:05.816 --> 07:07.339
Besides some
bizarre cravings,

07:07.339 --> 07:09.820
it's been relatively smooth,
but I just have to say,

07:09.820 --> 07:11.343
I'm, like,
itching like crazy today.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.084
I'd be worried
if you weren't.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.782
At this stage, your hormones
are running wild,

07:14.782 --> 07:19.177
and itching is totally normal
in a full term pregnancy.

07:19.177 --> 07:21.876
Hey, are you the guy
that brought her in?

07:21.876 --> 07:23.399
Security is about
to tow your van.

07:23.399 --> 07:24.444
What?

07:24.444 --> 07:26.402
Hey, Gus, sorry!
Thanks again!

07:26.402 --> 07:27.882
All right.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.361
I'd like to do an exam.

07:31.755 --> 07:34.845
Hey, Maya, anyone
you'd like us to call?

07:34.845 --> 07:36.586
Unfortunately not.

07:36.586 --> 07:39.154
I moved down here
for school in the spring,

07:39.154 --> 07:40.851
and all my family's
up in New York.

07:40.851 --> 07:42.723
And the baby's father?

07:42.723 --> 07:44.855
Not in the picture.

07:44.855 --> 07:47.075
Aw, I love your socks.

07:47.075 --> 07:48.468
Thank you.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.991
Could you put your heels more
in the stirrups?

07:49.991 --> 07:51.035
Yes.

07:51.035 --> 07:52.733
All right.

07:52.733 --> 07:55.736
You know, I was gonna hold
off on the sex of the baby,

07:55.736 --> 07:59.870
but I only made it to week 15.

07:59.870 --> 08:01.393
I just couldn't wait
to meet her.

08:01.393 --> 08:02.743
Well, I've got good news
for you, Maya.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.571
Your wait is over.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.573
You're about
6 centimeters dilated,

08:06.573 --> 08:09.184
which means this little girl
is coming today.

08:09.184 --> 08:10.533
Oh, my God!

08:10.533 --> 08:12.448
Congrats, Maya.

08:12.448 --> 08:14.102
All right, now I'm
gonna do an ultrasound

08:14.102 --> 08:15.756
to check on the baby.

08:15.756 --> 08:16.757
Okay?

08:16.757 --> 08:18.367
Okay.

08:20.674 --> 08:23.285
So Maya, it appears
your baby's breech.

08:23.285 --> 08:25.069
What does that mean?

08:25.069 --> 08:27.942
It just means that her head's
facing the wrong direction.

08:27.942 --> 08:29.160
Well, she's gonna be okay, right?

08:29.160 --> 08:30.640
Oh, yes.
It's very common.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.773
It just means we need
to deliver via C-section.

08:32.773 --> 08:35.558
- You mean like surgery?
- Yes, but don't worry.

08:35.558 --> 08:37.038
It is totally safe.

08:37.038 --> 08:39.867
And you can be
with us and awake

08:39.867 --> 08:41.564
the entire time if you want.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.305
Okay. Okay.

08:43.305 --> 08:45.437
- Okay. Hey, Doris.
- Yeah.

08:45.437 --> 08:47.004
Can we open up the hybrid OR?

08:47.004 --> 08:49.616
Yeah.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.270
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:52.270 --> 08:53.358
Where'd you get the scrubs?

08:53.358 --> 08:54.795
I do my own laundry.

08:54.795 --> 08:56.100
Every night?

08:56.100 --> 08:58.625
Every night
for precisely this reason.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.148
Is that some kind
of navy thing,

09:00.148 --> 09:01.541
the way you were trained?

09:04.065 --> 09:06.284
Flanked by a bunch
of Dudley Do-Rights.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.069
Awesome.

09:08.069 --> 09:10.332
Ethan, Kai, incoming.

09:10.332 --> 09:13.335
Courtney,
you're going to Baghdad.

09:13.335 --> 09:14.902
Talk to me, Court.

09:14.902 --> 09:18.166
36-year-old inmate stabbed
in the anterior lateral

09:18.166 --> 09:19.646
right neck in County.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.430
Bleeding stopped
with direct pressure.

09:21.430 --> 09:24.607
Intubated en route with sux
and etomidate, GCS 3.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.522
All right, looks like
there's no active bleeding.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.089
Let's get him ready
for a transfer.

09:31.614 --> 09:32.441
Everybody ready?

09:32.441 --> 09:34.486
Ready, one, two, three.

09:38.229 --> 09:40.841
Heart rate 94, BP 130/87.

09:40.841 --> 09:42.190
Sats 100%.

09:42.190 --> 09:43.365
Breath sounds are bilateral.

09:43.365 --> 09:44.671
Let's get him on a ventilator.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.063
Did I hear something
about an inmate

09:46.063 --> 09:47.412
coming in from Cook County?

09:47.412 --> 09:48.936
Someone get me an X-ray.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.981
Yeah, shanked in the neck.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.374
Oh, you'll love
this coincidence.

09:52.374 --> 09:54.245
His last name is Archer.

09:54.245 --> 09:55.507
Sean Archer.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.511
Yeah, it's a small world.

09:59.511 --> 10:01.470
Yeah.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.167
Wonder who this guy
pissed off.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.647
No active bleeding.

10:04.647 --> 10:07.215
A big old hematoma
in the neck, though.

10:07.215 --> 10:08.651
Here, let me look at that.

10:10.914 --> 10:12.612
X-ray's here.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.830
Hold.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.963
Hold on.
I'm feeling something in here.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.661
Let's get a neck X-ray as well.

10:18.661 --> 10:21.838
Make sure there's no
retained foreign body.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.190
- Hey, D.
- Not now. Not now.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.547
Renee's test results.

10:37.158 --> 10:38.812
Thyroid function is good.

10:38.812 --> 10:40.640
No endocrine problem.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.032
CT head is clean.

10:42.032 --> 10:43.947
Yeah, no family history
of mental illness either.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.470
No?
- No.

10:45.470 --> 10:48.038
So far, anyway,
no organic explanation

10:48.038 --> 10:49.213
for Renee's psychosis.

10:49.213 --> 10:51.912
So where does that leave us?

10:51.912 --> 10:53.740
Wait.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.655
What immunosuppressant
is she on?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.265
- Tacrolimus.
- Oh, crap.

10:57.265 --> 10:59.702
- What?
- Cyclosporine wouldn't work?

10:59.702 --> 11:02.096
Well, we tried that
pre-transplant,

11:02.096 --> 11:05.229
but Renee was allergic
to everything in that class.

11:05.229 --> 11:07.710
The tacrolimus
was our last option.

11:07.710 --> 11:08.668
Why do you ask?

11:10.321 --> 11:13.194
We suspect that Renee's
psychosis is being caused

11:13.194 --> 11:15.979
by the immunosuppressant
that she's been taking

11:15.979 --> 11:17.459
to protect her new kidney.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.374
Her tacrolimus?
Are you sure?

11:19.374 --> 11:23.117
We've just about ruled out
every other possibility.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.423
But the surgery
was ten months ago.

11:25.423 --> 11:27.774
As strange as it might sound,
reactions like this

11:27.774 --> 11:31.516
can occur even years
after surgery.

11:31.516 --> 11:34.128
So we should just take her
off her meds then, right?

11:34.128 --> 11:36.304
I wish it were
that easy, Seth.

11:36.304 --> 11:37.871
But without
the immunosuppressants,

11:37.871 --> 11:40.308
Renee's body
will reject the new kidney.

11:40.308 --> 11:42.005
After all this time?

11:42.005 --> 11:44.355
Unfortunately, yes.

11:44.355 --> 11:46.009
So what are we
supposed to do?

11:46.009 --> 11:49.578
Well, the next step would be
to try an antipsychotic.

11:49.578 --> 11:50.797
There's a drug
called olanzapine.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.320
We would like to start her
on a small dose

11:52.320 --> 11:53.756
and then see if that helps.

11:57.629 --> 11:59.283
Hey, Seth.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.807
Don't worry.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.373
We're gonna get this
under control, okay?

12:09.163 --> 12:10.730
Damn.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.688
Looks like the shank must have
broken off in his neck.

12:12.688 --> 12:14.734
Right, can we get him up
to the OR, please?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.170
What are you standing
around here for?

12:16.170 --> 12:18.781
Just do it.

12:18.781 --> 12:21.305
Tell the OR that I'm bringing
up the neck exploration, okay?

12:21.305 --> 12:22.654
- D.
- Yeah, one second.

12:22.654 --> 12:24.613
Uh, sorry, can we get
the shackles off him?

12:24.613 --> 12:25.875
He's not going anywhere,
all right?

12:25.875 --> 12:27.790
- Dean, Dean, Dean. Hey, Dean.
- What is it?

12:27.790 --> 12:29.226
Sean's in jail.

12:29.226 --> 12:30.880
Last time I asked,
you said he was out west.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.013
What's going on?

12:33.013 --> 12:34.405
It's a long story.

12:34.405 --> 12:36.059
Okay, I promise I will
get you caught up.

12:36.059 --> 12:37.104
I promise.
- Okay.

12:37.104 --> 12:38.366
But I got to go scrub now.

12:38.366 --> 12:39.541
I cannot stand here.

12:39.541 --> 12:40.847
Neil's on call
in trauma today.

12:40.847 --> 12:43.066
Let's let him operate.
He's as good as it gets.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.633
This is my son, Ethan.

12:44.633 --> 12:47.418
Exactly why you shouldn't
be doing the surgery.

12:47.418 --> 12:49.638
Come on, man.
You know I'm right.

12:53.555 --> 12:54.948
All right, hey, don't worry.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.471
I'll stay with Sean
the whole time, all right?

12:56.471 --> 12:57.951
- Yeah.
- All right.

13:10.964 --> 13:11.965
I'm sorry, Sharon.

13:11.965 --> 13:14.750
Oh. Excuse me, Sharon?

13:14.750 --> 13:17.144
Fred's on a call with the
board for the next hour or so.

13:17.144 --> 13:18.841
Is there something
I can help you with?

13:18.841 --> 13:22.540
Well, I don't know if
Mr. Meachem has heard or not,

13:22.540 --> 13:25.674
but we didn't get our
delivery of scrubs today.

13:25.674 --> 13:28.416
Fred is aware, yes.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.722
Maybe you should
ask him to come out.

13:30.722 --> 13:33.116
Is this really an emergency?

13:33.116 --> 13:36.424
Young man, scrubs are
critical in maintaining

13:36.424 --> 13:38.948
the integrity
of our operating rooms.

13:38.948 --> 13:41.124
We still have
surgical gowns, correct?

13:41.124 --> 13:44.562
And what do you expect them
to wear underneath?

13:44.562 --> 13:48.044
He should know that
besides putting our staff

13:48.044 --> 13:50.917
and patients at risk,
we're opening ourselves up

13:50.917 --> 13:52.527
for potential lawsuits.

13:52.527 --> 13:56.661
We should cancel
all elective surgeries

13:56.661 --> 13:58.185
until we iron this out.

13:58.185 --> 14:00.274
That would be a
big hit to the P&L.

14:00.274 --> 14:02.232
That's why I'm here
to see Mr. Meachem.

14:02.232 --> 14:04.931
I'll call your office
as soon as this breaks up,

14:04.931 --> 14:06.367
Ms. Goodwin.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.498
Thank you.

14:12.329 --> 14:13.853
Ta-da.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.637
- Trail mix.
- Vanessa's favorite.

14:15.637 --> 14:18.466
The kind with dried pineapple
and chocolate in it.

14:18.466 --> 14:20.250
And I wrote her
a little note too.

14:20.250 --> 14:21.512
Aw.

14:21.512 --> 14:22.862
I hope she knows how much
we all miss her.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.907
If she doesn't,

14:24.907 --> 14:27.214
she will by the time
she gets this package.

14:28.955 --> 14:30.347
Hey, sweetie.

14:30.347 --> 14:32.132
Hey, Ben.
What are you doing here?

14:32.132 --> 14:33.524
Student of mine
fell off the jungle gym.

14:33.524 --> 14:35.178
Ambo said they were
taking her here.

14:35.178 --> 14:37.964
Name's Mira Holloway.
- Oh.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.922
Yeah, she's in treatment 4.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.358
Come on.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.925
Doctor looks
no older than Mira.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.492
Aw, she's in good hands.

14:44.492 --> 14:45.623
Don't worry.

14:48.235 --> 14:51.760
Ms. Goodwin,
is this really all we got?

14:51.760 --> 14:52.892
I'm sorry.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.677
Yes, it's the best we have.

14:55.677 --> 14:56.808
It's kind of itchy.

14:56.808 --> 14:58.593
Yeah, they're fine.
We'll make do.

15:03.163 --> 15:06.688
Why are you looking
at me like that?

15:06.688 --> 15:09.952
It's okay.
I was just worried about you.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.258
Renee, how are you doing?

15:11.258 --> 15:14.174
Can you tell me
how you're feeling right now?

15:14.174 --> 15:15.958
How long have I been here?

15:15.958 --> 15:18.918
Since this morning.
You had a fall.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.443
You had the Zoom with Oslo,
but I had it all rescheduled.

15:22.443 --> 15:23.618
Oslo.

15:23.618 --> 15:26.229
The Abel prize.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.753
They're handing it out
next month?

15:28.753 --> 15:30.886
That's nice.

15:30.886 --> 15:32.018
You know what?

15:32.018 --> 15:33.584
Seth, I think we
should let your wife

15:33.584 --> 15:34.977
rest for a little bit.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.936
Renee, we'll be back
in just a few minutes, okay?

15:36.936 --> 15:38.154
Okay.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.726
What's wrong with her?

15:44.726 --> 15:47.076
Well, the olanzapine has
pretty severely obtunded her.

15:47.076 --> 15:48.599
- Obtunded?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

15:48.599 --> 15:51.515
It just means that she's
slower to react to stimuli.

15:51.515 --> 15:53.387
It's not an
uncommon side effect.

15:53.387 --> 15:55.911
This is gonna
wear off, right?

15:55.911 --> 15:58.696
The thing is, Seth,
is that when the tacrolimus

15:58.696 --> 16:01.961
is in play, like it is
with this side effect,

16:01.961 --> 16:04.833
that the pharmacology just
becomes a lot more delicate.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.443
But we can lower the dose.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.402
She's already had
the lowest dose.

16:08.402 --> 16:12.406
And frankly, her affect is just
extremely pronounced already.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.756
Did I read somewhere
that aripiprazole

16:14.756 --> 16:16.976
has a less sedative effect?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.412
Would that work better?

16:18.412 --> 16:20.283
You know, at this point,
it's worth a try.

16:20.283 --> 16:23.417
So why don't we let the
olanzapine clear her system

16:23.417 --> 16:25.985
and then give her
some aripiprazole

16:25.985 --> 16:27.943
and see if we get
to a better place?

16:36.343 --> 16:37.866
This suit is driving me nuts.

16:37.866 --> 16:40.216
Tell me about it.
I'm schvitzing like crazy.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.827
Okay, I can see the baby.

16:42.827 --> 16:44.220
Almost there, Maya.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.310
The baby flipped
to transverse back down.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.616
What does that mean?

16:48.616 --> 16:50.487
Just means
she's a little stuck.

16:50.487 --> 16:52.098
It's gonna take a bit longer.

16:52.098 --> 16:55.057
Grab the bandage scissors and
extend the uterine incision.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.841
Mm-hmm.

16:56.841 --> 16:58.278
- Hey, Dean.
- Yeah?

16:58.278 --> 17:00.845
It looks like we got
another prisoner coming in.

17:00.845 --> 17:02.021
What?

17:02.021 --> 17:03.544
Baghdad!

17:05.676 --> 17:07.548
Deke Niemann,
37-year-old male,

17:07.548 --> 17:10.029
blunt trauma to the chest,
abdomen, and back.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.900
Ended up in a
physical confrontation

17:11.900 --> 17:13.380
with a correction officer.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.338
Bastard got me with a baton.

17:15.338 --> 17:17.340
Cermak transferred
this one over.

17:17.340 --> 17:19.081
Here is the X-rays they took.
- I'll pull these up.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.876
On my count, one, two.

17:31.876 --> 17:34.096
Easy, man! That hurts.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.142
Hold on,
we have to recuff him.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.317
X-ray's up.

17:40.972 --> 17:42.409
Hemopneumothorax on the left.

17:42.409 --> 17:44.324
Get a chest tube tray.
Prep and drape.

17:44.324 --> 17:47.109
Push 100 of fentanyl,
2 of Versed.

17:48.589 --> 17:51.635
One of your coworkers trucked
this guy up pretty good.

17:51.635 --> 17:52.897
Totally justified.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.073
He had a weapon in his hand,

17:54.073 --> 17:55.161
was considered
armed and dangerous.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.206
A weapon?

17:57.206 --> 17:58.555
Was this the guy who--

17:58.555 --> 18:00.470
Who shanked
the other guy, yeah.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.430
We're ready for you, doctor.

18:11.438 --> 18:12.656
Help me, doc.

18:12.656 --> 18:14.658
I can't breathe.

18:16.617 --> 18:17.922
I can push the chest tube
if you want.

18:17.922 --> 18:20.186
No.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.970
I got it.

18:31.980 --> 18:35.679
Renee.

18:35.679 --> 18:36.898
Honey!

18:36.898 --> 18:38.073
What's wrong with her?

18:38.073 --> 18:40.206
I mean, she's--
she's catatonic.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.906
- Waxy rigidity.
- I don't understand.

18:44.906 --> 18:46.168
She's having
an even more extreme

18:46.168 --> 18:47.343
reaction to the aripiprazole.

18:47.343 --> 18:48.736
Will it get better?

18:48.736 --> 18:50.781
Unfortunately, it's this
class of drugs, right?

18:50.781 --> 18:53.219
These anti-psychotics
that typically

18:53.219 --> 18:56.091
mitigate this very unfortunate
side effect of tacrolimus.

18:56.091 --> 18:58.224
And sometimes they work,
sometimes they don't.

18:58.224 --> 19:00.356
So she's never gonna
get back to her normal self?

19:00.356 --> 19:03.751
As long as she's taking
this immunosuppressant,

19:03.751 --> 19:05.013
it's unlikely.

19:05.013 --> 19:07.755
I can't believe this.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.757
Getting this new kidney
was supposed

19:09.757 --> 19:10.888
to give Renee her life back.

19:10.888 --> 19:13.108
And now today--

19:13.108 --> 19:15.589
I cannot watch my wife
suffer like this anymore.

19:15.589 --> 19:18.026
I want to take her off
the immunosuppressant drugs

19:18.026 --> 19:20.246
once and for all.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.899
Uh, Seth.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.119
Seth, come on.

19:24.119 --> 19:25.425
We talked about this.

19:25.425 --> 19:27.557
Her kidney won't survive.
- I don't care.

19:27.557 --> 19:29.429
Think about everything
Renee went through.

19:29.429 --> 19:31.126
All those years on dialysis,
you really think

19:31.126 --> 19:32.432
she wants to get back to that?

19:32.432 --> 19:34.173
I know my wife.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.088
If she had to choose between
her body and her mind,

19:37.088 --> 19:38.960
it's not even close.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.441
You're serious about this?

19:41.441 --> 19:43.486
Renee waited six years
for someone

19:43.486 --> 19:45.532
to give her that kidney,
and you just want to--

19:45.532 --> 19:46.794
what, you want to kill it?

19:54.497 --> 19:59.198
Okay, okay,
so what if we remove it

19:59.198 --> 20:01.025
and put it back
into the donor pool?

20:01.025 --> 20:02.375
Is that possible?

20:02.375 --> 20:04.681
Well, I mean,
that would be unprecedented.

20:04.681 --> 20:07.031
We'd have to go to the
ethics committee with that.

20:07.031 --> 20:10.165
Seth, I really think
we need to slow down here,

20:10.165 --> 20:12.123
and at the very least,
give Renee a chance

20:12.123 --> 20:13.342
to weigh in for herself.

20:13.342 --> 20:14.996
Look at her!

20:14.996 --> 20:16.954
She cannot make this decision.

20:18.478 --> 20:22.090
I have her advance directive.
It's my choice, right?

20:22.090 --> 20:23.309
She is certainly impaired,

20:23.309 --> 20:24.832
and if you have
the advance directive--

20:24.832 --> 20:26.312
Uh-uh, no.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.878
This is what she would want.

20:27.878 --> 20:29.706
Remove the kidney.
Give it to someone else.

20:29.706 --> 20:32.187
Sorry, you're going have
to find another surgeon.

20:32.187 --> 20:34.929
I don't want anything
to do with this, okay?

20:42.023 --> 20:44.199
No, no, no, I'll tell her.

20:44.199 --> 20:46.854
Okay. Sharon, it's Cheryl.

20:46.854 --> 20:48.638
Says that you're
all set for tomorrow

20:48.638 --> 20:50.423
At 10:45 a.m. with Meachem.

20:50.423 --> 20:53.339
No, no, no. Uh-uh.

20:53.339 --> 20:54.905
Hey.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.211
Tomorrow?

20:56.211 --> 20:59.083
Doesn't Fred realize
this can't wait?

21:00.737 --> 21:02.783
You're kidding.

21:02.783 --> 21:04.567
No, no.

21:04.567 --> 21:07.353
That's all. Thank you.

21:07.353 --> 21:08.484
So?

21:08.484 --> 21:12.140
Evidently,
he has a 2:00 tee time.

21:17.014 --> 21:18.320
Hey.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.235
Good news.
- They get the blade out?

21:20.235 --> 21:21.671
Yeah, tied off
the external jugular,

21:21.671 --> 21:24.152
and Neil's confident
it missed his esophagus.

21:24.152 --> 21:25.762
Sean's gonna be okay.

21:25.762 --> 21:26.981
Thank you. Thanks.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.907
How's Mira doing?

21:39.907 --> 21:41.387
Evidently,
her X-rays look good.

21:41.387 --> 21:42.997
Zach's talking about
possibly running

21:42.997 --> 21:45.260
some more tests, though.
- Oh.

21:45.260 --> 21:46.957
There's a whole lot
of trail mix in there.

21:46.957 --> 21:50.134
Yeah, it was kind of
Vanessa's thing.

21:50.134 --> 21:51.353
It's gonna cost
a fortune shipping it

21:51.353 --> 21:53.007
to the Philippines, though.

21:54.574 --> 21:56.140
Hey, Maggie.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.665
Oh, good, I see you haven't
sent that box off yet.

21:58.665 --> 22:02.582
I just found the perfect thing
in the back of my closet.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.366
Vanessa's gonna love it.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.412
My old varsity jacket.
- Oh.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.152
Of course, you always
wore it more than me,

22:08.152 --> 22:11.982
but hey, you also looked
better in it, too, so.

22:11.982 --> 22:15.464
Hey.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.771
Um.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.338
This is my husband, Ben.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.818
Ben, this is Vanessa's
biological father,

22:21.818 --> 22:22.993
Grant Young.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.607
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you finally.

22:27.607 --> 22:28.608
Likewise.

22:35.136 --> 22:37.399
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa.
Where are you taking him?

22:37.399 --> 22:38.226
CT scan.

22:38.226 --> 22:39.619
On whose orders?

22:39.619 --> 22:41.185
Dr. Choi.

22:47.453 --> 22:48.367
Hey.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.456
Hey, what's with the chest CT?

22:50.456 --> 22:51.805
I'm looking at the
post-insertion X-ray.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.894
I'm concerned there's
still a hemothorax.

22:53.894 --> 22:55.461
I placed that chest tube.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.332
It's fine.
- I'm sure you're right,

22:57.332 --> 22:58.768
but there could be
a retained clot.

22:58.768 --> 23:00.944
A CT will give us
a better image of the damage.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.468
Oh, you didn't think about
running it by me first?

23:02.468 --> 23:04.208
We both know you can't
be the doctor of record

23:04.208 --> 23:05.471
on this patient, Dean.
- Come on.

23:05.471 --> 23:06.950
Look, if anything
were to happen--

23:06.950 --> 23:08.691
What are you saying,
that I can't remain objective?

23:08.691 --> 23:11.651
I know I couldn't
if I were in your shoes.

23:11.651 --> 23:14.305
Look, man, maybe you're
a better man than me,

23:14.305 --> 23:15.785
but why put yourself
in that position?

23:15.785 --> 23:17.308
It's a good thing you're not
wearing my shoes then.

23:17.308 --> 23:18.440
If you can't stand down,

23:18.440 --> 23:21.182
I'll have to take this up
with Goodwin.

23:21.182 --> 23:23.097
Please don't make me do that.

23:30.017 --> 23:33.237
Here she comes.

23:33.237 --> 23:34.630
Oh, got her.

23:40.723 --> 23:43.465
Hey.

23:43.465 --> 23:46.642
What a sweet baby.

23:46.642 --> 23:47.948
Yes, she is.

23:47.948 --> 23:49.340
We'll get her cleaned up.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.175
You okay?

23:58.175 --> 24:00.395
Yeah, it's just this suit.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.835
Say hi to Mama.

24:07.924 --> 24:09.709
Maya?

24:09.709 --> 24:10.884
Maya.

24:10.884 --> 24:13.539
Maya! Maya!

24:13.539 --> 24:15.236
Bag her!

24:15.236 --> 24:16.759
She was fine a second ago.

24:19.806 --> 24:22.069
Heart rate's down to 60.

24:22.069 --> 24:23.244
Amniotic fluid embolism?

24:23.244 --> 24:24.724
She's not coagulopathic.

24:24.724 --> 24:27.074
I mean, it could be,
but it's not a classic AFE.

24:27.074 --> 24:28.292
Hold on.

24:29.903 --> 24:32.383
Snoring respirations.

24:32.383 --> 24:33.776
Check her pupils.

24:36.779 --> 24:39.129
Pinpoint.

24:39.129 --> 24:40.435
I think she might be OD'ing.

24:40.435 --> 24:42.437
An overdose?
How is that possible?

24:42.437 --> 24:44.874
I don't know, but we need
to get Narcan now.

24:44.874 --> 24:45.875
Now!

24:51.533 --> 24:52.752
Maya?

24:52.752 --> 24:54.318
Are you with us?

24:54.318 --> 24:56.103
Yeah. Yes.

24:56.103 --> 24:59.062
What happened? What happened?

25:08.550 --> 25:10.770
So you're really
heading to the links?

25:10.770 --> 25:13.033
Aetna's senior VP is in town.

25:13.033 --> 25:14.817
Said we've got
a pressing matter.

25:14.817 --> 25:17.864
But we've got pressing
matters here as well.

25:17.864 --> 25:19.561
The surgical scrubs, right?

25:19.561 --> 25:21.868
I was told we found a solution.

25:21.868 --> 25:23.043
Hazmat suits?

25:23.043 --> 25:24.566
More of a Band-Aid
than a solution.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.873
Yeah, whatever you call it,
it'll do for now.

25:26.873 --> 25:29.528
Fred, I don't know
if you're aware,

25:29.528 --> 25:32.705
but the hospital's kind of
falling apart lately.

25:32.705 --> 25:35.229
And it's not a good look
when the guy

25:35.229 --> 25:37.057
who's supposed to be
holding the glue

25:37.057 --> 25:40.277
is off working on his handicap
on a weekday.

25:40.277 --> 25:43.498
Lakeview Linens is trying
to jam a 30% increase

25:43.498 --> 25:45.195
down my throat, Sharon.

25:45.195 --> 25:46.588
The hospital just
can't roll over

25:46.588 --> 25:47.981
and accept terms like that,

25:47.981 --> 25:50.113
not if you want to keep
the doors open.

25:50.113 --> 25:53.073
Scrubs are something we
can do without for a bit

25:53.073 --> 25:54.857
if we need to.
- You're wrong.

25:54.857 --> 25:59.514
Besides maintaining a clean
and safe environment in the OR,

25:59.514 --> 26:02.082
they give our people
a sense of purpose,

26:02.082 --> 26:04.563
instill our patients
with the confidence

26:04.563 --> 26:06.608
that we know what we're doing.

26:06.608 --> 26:09.306
That lowly piece of clothing

26:09.306 --> 26:12.919
has an incalculable effect
on the healing process.

26:12.919 --> 26:15.269
I can't work with
incalculable, Sharon.

26:15.269 --> 26:16.575
I need a number.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.490
You know, I don't have
any good options here.

26:19.490 --> 26:22.537
So I'm gonna recommend
that we postpone

26:22.537 --> 26:26.280
all elective surgeries
until this thing is resolved.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.760
48 hours.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.065
Please. I know they'll cave.

26:29.065 --> 26:30.763
I'm sorry, Fred.

26:30.763 --> 26:32.416
I don't have a choice.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.814
I swear, I've never
done a drug in my life.

26:38.814 --> 26:41.774
And of course, I would never
do anything to harm my baby.

26:41.774 --> 26:44.646
I'm not here to make
any accusations.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.126
I promise.

26:46.126 --> 26:48.345
We just have to do
our due diligence.

26:48.345 --> 26:50.783
Is this gonna keep me
from taking my baby home?

26:50.783 --> 26:52.262
We're gonna do
everything we can to try

26:52.262 --> 26:53.960
and stop that from happening.
- Yeah.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.744
Let's start by running
a few tests,

26:55.744 --> 26:58.181
and we can take it
from there, okay?

26:58.181 --> 27:02.664
Look, Maya, you have
been through so much today.

27:02.664 --> 27:03.970
Just try and rest.

27:03.970 --> 27:06.537
We'll be back
to check on you soon, okay?

27:13.327 --> 27:14.545
So?

27:14.545 --> 27:16.852
If I had to say,
she's telling the truth.

27:16.852 --> 27:18.680
So no need to call DCFS?

27:18.680 --> 27:20.160
Not yet, anyway.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.596
She consented to testing,

27:21.596 --> 27:23.946
so we can run a hair sample,
which will tell us

27:23.946 --> 27:25.731
if this really was a one-off.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.080
I'll report back.
- All right.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.082
Thanks, Nellie.
- Yeah.

27:29.082 --> 27:30.692
I just don't get it.

27:30.692 --> 27:33.260
How can she be fine one minute
and OD'ing the next?

27:33.260 --> 27:35.349
I mean, there was probably
a certain amount of adrenaline

27:35.349 --> 27:38.178
that kept her alert,
and then baby came,

27:38.178 --> 27:39.962
and the effects
of the drugs hit her.

27:39.962 --> 27:41.355
Yeah, but what drugs?

27:41.355 --> 27:42.617
That's the million dollar question.

27:42.617 --> 27:45.185
- Yeah.
- You've still got that rash?

27:45.185 --> 27:48.101
It's like they sewed those
suits out of poison ivy.

27:48.101 --> 27:50.712
Try popping an antihistamine.

27:50.712 --> 27:51.931
I'm gonna go check on the baby.

27:56.587 --> 27:59.721
So the ethics committee
is mulling it over.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.331
And get this:

28:01.331 --> 28:04.117
Organ Donors of America
already found an HLA match

28:04.117 --> 28:06.641
for Renee's kidney.

28:06.641 --> 28:09.035
- So it's happening.
- Well, who knows?

28:09.035 --> 28:11.690
I mean, you know,
ethics committee

28:11.690 --> 28:14.127
tends to bog down when
the surgeon of record

28:14.127 --> 28:15.737
goes missing, you know?

28:15.737 --> 28:17.957
Won't weigh in.

28:17.957 --> 28:20.350
I'm guessing
from your tone, you, uh,

28:20.350 --> 28:22.396
you think this is
the right thing to do?

28:22.396 --> 28:25.007
I think it's better
than the alternative.

28:25.007 --> 28:27.836
If Renee goes off
the immunosuppressants,

28:27.836 --> 28:29.533
her kidney won't survive, right?

28:29.533 --> 28:33.799
At least this way, somebody
else might really benefit.

28:33.799 --> 28:36.671
You know, Renee's transplant
was the first time

28:36.671 --> 28:39.108
Pamela showed me how
to resize a renal artery.

28:39.108 --> 28:41.241
She had this great cheat
where she would split

28:41.241 --> 28:42.895
the artery to match the size.

28:42.895 --> 28:44.070
Mechanical genius.

28:44.070 --> 28:45.854
Always was
a brilliant surgeon.

28:45.854 --> 28:48.814
Who may never operate again.

28:48.814 --> 28:50.598
I made a decision for her,
and look what happened.

28:50.598 --> 28:52.426
I know this is
complicated for you, okay?

28:52.426 --> 28:55.255
But you cannot let
what happened with Pamela

28:55.255 --> 28:58.258
affect how you approach
this case.

28:58.258 --> 29:00.477
But from where I'm sitting,
Seth's a good man.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.610
Got his wife's
best interests at heart,

29:02.610 --> 29:06.309
and most important of all,
he knows her mind.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.095
And what if he's wrong?

29:09.095 --> 29:10.749
Buddy, I just don't
really think that

29:10.749 --> 29:12.794
it's our place to judge that.

29:18.669 --> 29:20.193
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:20.193 --> 29:21.672
Chest scan came back
for our friend over there.

29:21.672 --> 29:23.370
Confirms a whole bunch
of rib fractures

29:23.370 --> 29:24.893
and a retained hemopneumothorax.

29:24.893 --> 29:26.416
Yeah, with the
mild right shift,

29:26.416 --> 29:27.809
looks like his chest
is still under tension

29:27.809 --> 29:28.854
even with the chest tube.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.290
Was the tube placed properly?

29:30.290 --> 29:32.205
Yeah, but it's clotted off.

29:32.205 --> 29:33.728
Not tidaling.
We need to replace it.

29:35.208 --> 29:36.426
Heart rate's in the 40s.

29:36.426 --> 29:39.429
He's bradying down.
Start bagging.

29:39.429 --> 29:40.822
Check for pulse.

29:43.129 --> 29:44.304
No, I don't feel one.

29:44.304 --> 29:45.827
All right,
tension pneumothorax.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.655
Start CPR.

29:47.655 --> 29:49.048
Thoracotomy tray.

29:53.356 --> 29:54.836
All right, hold for a second.

30:02.888 --> 30:04.019
Whoa.

30:04.019 --> 30:05.542
Feel that rush of air?

30:14.595 --> 30:15.639
Still no pulse.

30:21.384 --> 30:22.864
He's fibrillating.

30:22.864 --> 30:24.126
Give me the internal paddles.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.871
Charge to 50.

30:29.871 --> 30:31.177
All charged.

30:31.177 --> 30:33.744
All right.

30:33.744 --> 30:34.745
Clear.

30:39.185 --> 30:41.796
I got a rhythm.

30:41.796 --> 30:44.016
Pulse is back.

30:44.016 --> 30:46.279
That was fricking insane.

30:46.279 --> 30:47.976
Call the OR.

30:54.765 --> 30:56.898
Zach's saying
he won't discharge Mira

30:56.898 --> 30:58.595
until she gets an MRI.

30:58.595 --> 31:01.555
Well, he's just dotting
his I's and crossing his T's.

31:01.555 --> 31:03.339
It doesn't mean that
she's not doing okay.

31:03.339 --> 31:06.342
Yeah, well, it's causing
Mira's mom a little anxiety.

31:06.342 --> 31:08.431
And why is it
taking him so long?

31:08.431 --> 31:11.739
Well, Ben, you do know
that we're short staffed.

31:11.739 --> 31:13.219
Right?

31:13.219 --> 31:14.350
I'm sure that Radiology

31:14.350 --> 31:15.743
will get to Mira
as soon as they can.

31:15.743 --> 31:17.353
You know, if I knew
this place was gonna be

31:17.353 --> 31:19.138
this unresponsive,
I would have told the ambo

31:19.138 --> 31:20.617
take her to another hospital.

31:20.617 --> 31:23.577
Wait, am I sensing a bit
of a hostility here?

31:23.577 --> 31:25.187
Does this have to do
with Grant bringing in

31:25.187 --> 31:26.623
that jacket in today?

31:26.623 --> 31:28.538
Not at all.

31:28.538 --> 31:29.800
Why would I be
bothered by that?

31:29.800 --> 31:32.455
You shouldn't be.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.675
Really?

31:34.675 --> 31:36.590
I do seem to remember
you telling me

31:36.590 --> 31:38.070
that you weren't gonna
have anything to do with him.

31:38.070 --> 31:39.723
Ben, this isn't about me.

31:39.723 --> 31:40.899
It's about Vanessa.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.205
Yeah.

31:43.205 --> 31:45.947
It's always about Vanessa.

31:45.947 --> 31:47.253
Hey, Maggie.

31:47.253 --> 31:48.645
Sorry to bother you.

31:48.645 --> 31:49.429
You got a second?

31:49.429 --> 31:51.779
Yeah, she's free.

31:54.695 --> 31:56.262
Yeah, Joe.

31:57.872 --> 32:00.266
Hey, your C-section, Maya.

32:00.266 --> 32:02.616
You got a tox back?
- No, not yet. Why?

32:02.616 --> 32:04.270
Well, get this,
I was talking to security,

32:04.270 --> 32:06.098
that guy who brought her in.

32:06.098 --> 32:08.491
When they were towing his van,
they got a hit on his tags.

32:08.491 --> 32:10.667
PD took him into custody.

32:10.667 --> 32:13.366
Turns out he was
transporting carfentanil.

32:13.366 --> 32:14.845
Maybe Maya got exposed.

32:14.845 --> 32:16.673
Well, maybe we all did.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.806
We went to that car
to pull her out.

32:18.806 --> 32:22.201
It could be why
you were itchy all day.

32:22.201 --> 32:25.117
Nothing to do
with the hazmat suits.

32:25.117 --> 32:26.683
We need to get you into decon.

32:26.683 --> 32:28.337
Where's Will?

32:33.560 --> 32:35.779
- Will?
- I'll get the Narcan.

32:35.779 --> 32:38.521
Hey, hey, no, no, no, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey.

32:38.521 --> 32:41.394
Will, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stay with me. Come on.

32:41.394 --> 32:42.873
It's on his shirt.

32:42.873 --> 32:43.918
Here you go.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.137
Hey, come on.

32:54.015 --> 32:55.321
You okay?

32:55.321 --> 32:57.192
Shh, stay down. Stay down.

32:57.192 --> 32:59.586
Uh-huh.

32:59.586 --> 33:01.327
We need to decontaminate now.

33:01.327 --> 33:02.981
- Yeah.
- Okay, come on.

33:07.463 --> 33:08.638
Hey, you okay?

33:08.638 --> 33:10.118
Yeah, I think so.

33:10.118 --> 33:11.511
The first half hour
is when you feel it the most,

33:11.511 --> 33:14.862
but after that, the drug
should clear your system.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.907
Yeah.
You should probably go first.

33:16.907 --> 33:19.040
I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.911
Oh, come on.
What's the big deal?

33:20.911 --> 33:23.001
How many times have we
seen each other naked?

33:39.452 --> 33:40.366
Hey.

33:44.631 --> 33:46.024
Thanks.

33:50.332 --> 33:52.595
It's crazy.

33:52.595 --> 33:54.075
We're right back
where we started.

33:54.075 --> 33:56.425
What do you mean?

33:56.425 --> 34:01.430
Well, when we first met,
you were Narcanning me.

34:04.825 --> 34:06.348
I guess we're even.

34:06.348 --> 34:08.437
There's no need
to keep score.

34:16.358 --> 34:18.143
Here you go.

34:18.143 --> 34:20.754
A recipient giving up
a perfectly healthy kidney.

34:20.754 --> 34:24.453
20 years in this biz, and I've
never seen anything like this.

34:24.453 --> 34:25.976
Yeah.

34:25.976 --> 34:28.153
- Thanks, Crockett.
- Yeah.

34:31.286 --> 34:34.898
Dr. Hutchins, thank you
for taking such good care

34:34.898 --> 34:37.118
of my Mira today.

34:37.118 --> 34:40.078
And you, Mr. Campbell.

34:43.994 --> 34:46.040
Your husband's a saint.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.650
Thank you.

34:47.650 --> 34:49.783
That's what they tell me.

34:56.746 --> 34:58.008
Ben, listen.

34:58.008 --> 34:59.140
- I got to run...
- But--

34:59.140 --> 35:01.229
If I'm gonna
make bowling league.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.188
I'll try not to wake you
when I come in.

35:08.889 --> 35:10.847
Prepare to be excited.

35:10.847 --> 35:12.414
Come on.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.810
That's all of 'em.

35:16.810 --> 35:18.464
We'll have the rest here tomorrow.

35:18.464 --> 35:19.943
Thanks, Harry.

35:22.207 --> 35:24.861
I thought you said that
you struck out with Fred.

35:24.861 --> 35:26.341
I thought I did.

35:26.341 --> 35:28.169
- Oh, man.
- So what happened?

35:28.169 --> 35:30.084
They got here sooner
than I wanted.

35:30.084 --> 35:32.042
I was hoping to be here
for the big surprise.

35:32.042 --> 35:34.741
So this is all your doing.

35:34.741 --> 35:37.570
So it turns out these guys
are in discussion with us

35:37.570 --> 35:39.528
about upgrading their fleet.

35:39.528 --> 35:41.661
I spoke to the president,
made it clear

35:41.661 --> 35:43.750
that I wouldn't feel good
doing business with a company

35:43.750 --> 35:46.535
that's trying to chisel a civic
institution like Chicago Med.

35:46.535 --> 35:48.929
And they promised that
they wouldn't raise

35:48.929 --> 35:50.191
their prices anytime soon.

35:50.191 --> 35:51.627
Oh, that's very nice.

35:51.627 --> 35:53.542
Thanks, Jack.
- Just trying to help.

35:53.542 --> 35:56.328
Oh, hey, let's get a shot
with these scrubs, yeah?

35:56.328 --> 35:58.112
It'd be good
for your social media feed.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.421
Ready?

36:04.118 --> 36:06.207
It's nice to have
a guardian angel.

36:06.207 --> 36:10.211
Yeah, but not really
a viable business strategy

36:10.211 --> 36:12.387
for the long run, is it?
- No.

36:13.997 --> 36:18.828
So if I'm hearing correctly,
I was experiencing psychosis

36:18.828 --> 36:20.395
due to the immunosuppressants,

36:20.395 --> 36:23.920
but the antipsychotic
had a dulling effect.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.184
That's right.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.011
And you decided that
removing my kidney

36:28.011 --> 36:31.232
was the best solution?

36:31.232 --> 36:35.193
Honey, I didn't
know what else to do.

36:37.282 --> 36:40.198
My mind to me an empire is.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.898
I would have done
the same thing.

36:44.898 --> 36:46.465
God, I--

36:46.465 --> 36:49.598
Though I guess we have to get
used to all of this again.

36:49.598 --> 36:54.342
We'll get through
it together.

36:54.342 --> 36:59.565
Thank you for taking
such good care of me.

36:59.565 --> 37:01.131
I love you.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.403
So the drugs
were on my socks?

37:11.403 --> 37:13.231
Yeah, we think that they were
slowly leaching carfentanil

37:13.231 --> 37:14.449
into your skin all day,

37:14.449 --> 37:16.234
which is what caused you
to overdose.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.540
I just can't believe this.

37:18.540 --> 37:23.241
You know, Gus dealing drugs,
I had no idea.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.025
What about the baby?

37:25.025 --> 37:27.897
Thankfully,
she was not exposed.

37:27.897 --> 37:29.812
We know that this might not
have been the birth

37:29.812 --> 37:32.641
you had planned for,
but the good news is that

37:32.641 --> 37:36.210
you and baby
are healthy and safe.

37:36.210 --> 37:37.690
Thank you.

37:37.690 --> 37:39.300
Thank you both.

37:44.653 --> 37:47.395
I never thought
I'd be so relieved

37:47.395 --> 37:49.528
to put on a pair of scrubs.

37:52.574 --> 37:54.228
Are you hungry?

37:54.228 --> 37:57.666
There's this great new
burrito stand over on Lake.

37:57.666 --> 38:01.453
I think I'm gonna try to hit
a meeting on the way home,

38:01.453 --> 38:03.193
just be on the safe side.

38:04.543 --> 38:07.023
You are welcome
to join if you want.

38:07.023 --> 38:08.851
Ah, that's okay.

38:08.851 --> 38:10.375
After today, I'm pretty sure

38:10.375 --> 38:11.724
I'm never gonna
touch this stuff again.

38:15.031 --> 38:16.119
See you tomorrow?

38:18.948 --> 38:20.602
Good night.

38:30.438 --> 38:32.048
Guy get out of surgery yet?

38:32.048 --> 38:33.659
Yeah.

38:33.659 --> 38:36.966
He'll be kept in the ICU
a couple of days before they--

38:36.966 --> 38:40.405
Discharge back into custody.

38:40.405 --> 38:41.406
Yeah.

38:43.190 --> 38:44.322
Heh.

38:46.541 --> 38:49.152
Boy, some father
I turned out to be, huh?

38:50.589 --> 38:54.114
My son dropped out
of my life for 15 years,

38:54.114 --> 38:59.641
then dropped into addiction, prison.

39:01.687 --> 39:04.298
And just today, I helped
save the life of a guy

39:04.298 --> 39:07.432
who tried to kill him

39:07.432 --> 39:10.870
and who very well
may try to kill him again.

39:10.870 --> 39:12.262
Yeah?

39:12.262 --> 39:15.701
I mean, I had
exactly one job...

39:18.356 --> 39:21.054
Protect my boy.

39:21.054 --> 39:22.795
And I failed.

39:22.795 --> 39:27.452
I could tell you that...

39:27.452 --> 39:29.584
That you didn't have a choice,
that we took an oath.

39:29.584 --> 39:31.412
But I don't think
that'd be much comfort.

39:32.892 --> 39:36.722
How come you didn't let me know
what's going on with Sean?

39:39.333 --> 39:40.639
I was ashamed.

39:43.250 --> 39:44.382
Yeah.

39:46.253 --> 39:48.081
Okay.

39:49.343 --> 39:50.692
Hey. Hey, Dean.

39:50.692 --> 39:51.693
Yeah.

39:55.175 --> 39:57.264
It's Sean.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.269
Come on.

40:06.839 --> 40:09.145
All right.
He's ready to extubate.

40:09.145 --> 40:10.364
Kai, I can do that.

40:10.364 --> 40:12.714
- It's all right. I got it.
- Please.

40:12.714 --> 40:14.455
This is my son.

40:15.978 --> 40:16.979
Oh.

40:34.867 --> 40:35.868
Where am I?

40:38.261 --> 40:40.220
You're in the hospital, Sean.

40:40.220 --> 40:41.613
You just got out of surgery.

40:47.706 --> 40:48.663
Dad.

40:50.665 --> 40:52.885
It's gonna be okay, my boy.

40:54.669 --> 40:55.583
You're okay.

40:57.542 --> 40:59.195
It's gonna be okay.
