17:47.999 --> 17:50.999
- I have no idea
about that yet, so...

17:51.999 --> 17:53.999
- Go out with some dignity,

17:53.999 --> 17:55.999
and don't leave the rest
of your crew hanging.

17:55.999 --> 17:57.999
- What the hell?
Are you kidding me?

17:57.999 --> 17:59.999
Oh, man.
What the [bleep]?

17:59.999 --> 18:01.999
- Someone's got to get pushed
under the bus.

18:01.999 --> 18:02.999
- Are you kidding me?

18:02.999 --> 18:05.999
I totally respect
Chef's decision

18:05.999 --> 18:06.999
to do what's right for him,

18:06.999 --> 18:09.999
but it leaves us
in a bad position right now.

18:09.999 --> 18:10.999
We have a meal and no chef.

18:10.999 --> 18:13.999
- One more hug. You too.
- Yeah?

18:14.999 --> 18:16.999
- Take care of yourself,
all right?

18:16.999 --> 18:17.999
- I haven't come here
to rock the boat.

18:17.999 --> 18:19.999
I've come here to do the job
I get paid to do.

18:19.999 --> 18:20.999
That's it.

18:20.999 --> 18:21.999
Happy cooking.

18:21.999 --> 18:24.999
I have a family
back in Australia.

18:24.999 --> 18:27.999
I have two amazing daughters,
so they're my inspiration.

18:27.999 --> 18:29.999
You know, I was a chef
before I ever got into yachting.

18:29.999 --> 18:31.999
I've worked all over the world.

18:31.999 --> 18:33.999
And the next one, I'm gonna run
it the way I want to run it,

18:33.999 --> 18:36.999
and it's just going
to follow suit.

18:36.999 --> 18:39.999
Get me home.
[bleep] hell.

18:41.999 --> 18:43.999
- I'm not staying.

18:43.999 --> 18:46.999
Leon's gone,
and I have nobody.

18:47.999 --> 18:50.999
Chef leaving is me leaving too.
- Why?

18:50.999 --> 18:51.999
- 'Cause I don't believe
that Captain made

18:51.999 --> 18:52.999
the right decision.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.999
I don't have respect
for my chief stew,

18:54.999 --> 18:57.999
and now, as a Captain, I don't
have respect for him either,

18:57.999 --> 18:59.999
so how am I supposed
to be here

18:59.999 --> 19:01.999
when I don't have respect
for the two people

19:01.999 --> 19:03.999
that I need
to have respect for?

19:03.999 --> 19:04.999
- Because you have respect
for yourself,

19:04.999 --> 19:05.999
and you're doing
a great job.

19:05.999 --> 19:07.999
- For me to have respect
for myself

19:07.999 --> 19:09.999
means standing up
in what I believe in.

19:09.999 --> 19:10.999
And guess what.

19:10.999 --> 19:12.999
I believe in that Chef
was a good chef.

19:12.999 --> 19:15.999
- We're on the same team here.
Don't yell at us.

19:15.999 --> 19:17.999
- The person that I think
should be leaving this boat

19:17.999 --> 19:19.999
is the chief stew.

19:19.999 --> 19:20.999
- Can I just try to explain it
from Captain's point of view?

19:20.999 --> 19:24.999
So the chef
is this one entity.

19:24.999 --> 19:26.999
The chief stew controls

19:26.999 --> 19:28.000
so many different parts
of the boat.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.999
After this,
we have two charters left.

19:29.999 --> 19:31.999
It would be crazy

19:31.999 --> 19:33.999
to bring in
a brand-new chief stew

19:33.999 --> 19:36.999
and to have her expect to know
where everything is.

19:36.999 --> 19:38.999
- Wow. I can't believe it.

19:38.999 --> 19:40.999

the pro boatswain.

19:40.999 --> 19:41.999
Come on. Really?

19:41.999 --> 19:43.999

19:43.999 --> 19:44.999

kind of standing up

19:44.999 --> 19:47.999
or, like, understanding
where I'm coming from.

19:47.999 --> 19:48.999

19:48.999 --> 19:49.999

are being rude to each other.

19:49.999 --> 19:51.999
They are. They are.

19:51.999 --> 19:53.999
- You and I have
this other relationship,

19:53.999 --> 19:55.999
and now you're on her side?

19:55.999 --> 19:58.999
I'm not playing that.
I'm done.

19:58.999 --> 20:00.999
- And then you're just gonna
walk away?

20:00.999 --> 20:02.999

20:02.999 --> 20:04.999

20:10.999 --> 20:13.999

to the captain.

20:13.999 --> 20:15.999

20:20.999 --> 20:21.999

her mermaid tail.

but I would call that an exodus.

20:50.999 --> 20:52.999

- Yeah, she's jumping.

20:56.999 --> 20:59.999
Guys, we have--
Rocky's in the water.

20:59.999 --> 21:01.999
We got Rocky in the water.

21:03.999 --> 21:05.999

21:06.000 --> 21:09.999

Oh, my God. I'm free.

Ah!

21:15.999 --> 21:18.999
Screw those people!

21:18.999 --> 21:19.999

21:19.999 --> 21:21.999

anybody but Rocky,

21:21.999 --> 21:22.999
I would have been concerned,

21:22.999 --> 21:24.999
but because Rocky's
a strong swimmer,

I'm actually

21:26.999 --> 21:28.999
Where does she think
she's going?

21:28.999 --> 21:30.999

and get on that boat.

21:30.999 --> 21:31.999
Oh, the charter guests
are coming back?

- Okay.

and then I'm going to greet
them on the aft deck.

22:07.999 --> 22:12.999

22:13.999 --> 22:16.999

Was it good enough, though?

22:16.999 --> 22:17.999
- We got to experience
some killer caves.

22:17.999 --> 22:19.999
- That's good.

22:19.999 --> 22:22.999

We had a fire drill last night.

to be good at these things.

that Rocky cooked for us,

to her, do my job.

I'm going to make this happen.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.999
Eddie, I need those plates.
- We got oysters.

33:21.999 --> 33:24.999
- Boom. Little oysters.
Ooh, I have a great idea!

33:24.999 --> 33:25.999
I've got my ideas.
Mmm!

33:26.000 --> 33:27.999
It's going to taste amazing.
They're going to love it.

33:27.999 --> 33:29.000
- What's in there?

33:29.999 --> 33:30.999
- Grenadine.
It's a little strange.

33:30.999 --> 33:33.999
- I had faith in Rocky, 'cause
all yacht chefs are crazy,

33:33.999 --> 33:35.999
and she's definitely got
the crazy part down.

33:35.999 --> 33:37.999
- I'm leaving.
- Amy, this is

33:37.999 --> 33:39.999

with a little grenadine.

33:39.999 --> 33:40.999
- Don't say "grenadine."

33:40.999 --> 33:42.999
- It's either this or nothing.

33:42.999 --> 33:44.999
Let's just hope
they're too drunk

33:44.999 --> 33:46.999
to tell there's grenadine
on the oysters.

33:46.999 --> 33:48.999
- "Oh, my gosh,
you put grenadine

33:48.999 --> 33:50.999
on the freakin' oysters?"

33:50.999 --> 33:52.999
- These are pretty.

33:52.999 --> 33:54.999
Let's put a little bit of lemon
on here.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.999
- You can eat that,
whatever that is.

33:59.999 --> 34:02.999
- I'm not sure who's looking
for extra oysters.

34:02.999 --> 34:05.999
- You don't like--
Is it a texture thing?

34:05.999 --> 34:09.999
- Okay.
Your next course is coming soon.

34:09.999 --> 34:11.999
- You're not going
to eat your oyster?

34:11.999 --> 34:13.999
- Dig in.

34:16.999 --> 34:17.999
- Okay.

34:19.999 --> 34:21.999
Uh, Kate and Amy?

34:21.999 --> 34:23.999

34:25.999 --> 34:27.000

- Yeah.

34:27.999 --> 34:29.999
- The oysters?
- I don't know.

34:29.999 --> 34:30.999
- Wait. What?

34:30.999 --> 34:33.999
- Something tells me grenadine
on oysters

34:33.999 --> 34:35.999
wasn't the best call.

34:35.999 --> 34:37.999
- Alan, are you okay?

34:37.999 --> 34:39.999
Is Rocky really trying
to help with this meal,

34:39.999 --> 34:42.999
or is she still really upset
about Leon leaving

34:42.999 --> 34:45.999
and she's trying to sabotage
this birthday dinner?

34:45.999 --> 34:47.999
[toilet flushing]

34:47.999 --> 34:49.999
- Primary's
in his bathroom puking.

34:49.999 --> 34:51.999
- From what?
- I have no idea.

34:51.999 --> 34:53.999
But that's why they didn't
bring anything up just yet.

34:53.999 --> 34:54.999
- Did everyone eat
the oysters?

34:54.999 --> 34:56.999
- I do not know.

34:56.999 --> 34:58.999
So I came back out here.

35:04.999 --> 35:06.999
- Good?

35:06.999 --> 35:10.999
- [bleep].

35:10.999 --> 35:11.999
God damn.

35:11.999 --> 35:12.999
- Okay. All right.

35:12.999 --> 35:13.999
- How do I get
this [bleep] pan hot?

35:13.999 --> 35:15.999
This can't go on any longer.

35:15.999 --> 35:18.999
Sorry, Rocky.
I'm taking charge now.

35:18.999 --> 35:19.999
- [bleep], dude.
I don't know.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.999
Now you're [bleep] making--
you're second-guessing me, so...

35:21.999 --> 35:23.999
When Leon leaves,
Eddie doesn't have my back,

35:23.999 --> 35:24.999
and it totally hurts me,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.999
and then I'm cooking dinner,
and he's nervous

35:27.999 --> 35:29.999
that I'm not going to be able
to, like, put it together.

35:29.999 --> 35:30.999
It's super frustrating.

35:30.999 --> 35:33.999
- We could just sear 'em
and cook 'em in the oven.

35:33.999 --> 35:37.000
- I wanted to say a few things
about the man of the hour.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.999
We love your sense of humor,

35:38.999 --> 35:40.999
your smile
and your thoughtfulness.

35:40.999 --> 35:43.999
- Everybody loves everybody.
Now let's go home.

35:43.999 --> 35:44.999
- Yeah.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.999
- Cheers, you guys.

35:47.999 --> 35:49.999
- Okay, we're ready
to take 'em.

35:49.999 --> 35:50.999
- So that and then the steaks
are going to go.

35:50.999 --> 35:52.999
- The table's not that big.
You're going to have

35:52.999 --> 35:53.999
to put the steak on the plate
with the vegetables.

35:53.999 --> 35:55.999
- That's fine. Put it
right on top of the vegetables.

35:55.999 --> 35:57.000
- I don't understand
why we can't just drop that off

35:57.999 --> 35:58.999
and come back.

35:58.999 --> 36:01.000
- Because we don't have time,
we don't have room.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.999
That's why.

36:02.999 --> 36:03.999
And hopefully that steak

36:03.999 --> 36:06.000
will cover up the fact
that you put Oreos on a salad.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.999
It's a win-win.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.000
- So communication
would have been key there.

36:09.999 --> 36:11.999
- I didn't know you wanted--
- Don't talk to me.

36:11.999 --> 36:14.999
Don't talk to me.
- Enough.

36:14.999 --> 36:16.999
Let's just get
through this dinner, please.

36:16.999 --> 36:19.999
- Yeah, sure, Dad.
- Okay. Thank you.

36:19.999 --> 36:21.999
Without getting attitude
with people.

36:21.999 --> 36:23.999
Rocky's a lunatic.

36:23.999 --> 36:25.999
I don't know how I was actually
involved with this girl.

36:27.999 --> 36:28.999
That's it for me.

36:28.999 --> 36:29.999
- It looks delicious.

36:29.999 --> 36:30.999
- There you go.
There you go.

36:30.999 --> 36:32.999
- Pardon me.

36:32.999 --> 36:33.999
- The caves were definitely
a little tight.

36:33.999 --> 36:35.999
- Is this a filet?
- It is...

36:35.999 --> 36:37.999
with roast vegetables
and au jus.

36:37.999 --> 36:39.999
And [bleep] Oreos.

36:39.999 --> 36:41.999
- Beautiful.

36:42.999 --> 36:44.999
- Coming up...

36:44.999 --> 36:45.999
- You know what you're
really good at, Kate?

36:45.999 --> 36:47.999
You're a jabber.
You just jab, jab.

36:47.999 --> 36:49.999
- You know what you're
really good at?

36:49.999 --> 36:50.999
- What?

36:57.999 --> 36:58.999
leep] like,

36:58.999 --> 36:59.999
"Hey, the table's really small.

36:59.999 --> 37:02.999
We're only going
to be able to use one plate."

37:02.999 --> 37:03.999
- You all right?

37:03.999 --> 37:05.999
- I'm fine. Do you see
what I've been working with?

37:05.999 --> 37:06.999
- Yes.
- It's ridiculous.

37:06.999 --> 37:08.999
- It is, it is.
- It's disrespectful.

37:08.999 --> 37:10.999
- Where's the [bleep]
communication there?

37:10.999 --> 37:12.999
I don't know.

37:12.999 --> 37:14.999
- You need
to calm down, honey.

37:17.999 --> 37:19.999
- Let's eat.

37:22.999 --> 37:24.999
- I hope this goes over
better than the oysters did.

37:26.999 --> 37:27.999
- That's a good steak.

37:27.999 --> 37:29.999
Their cooking here is amazing.
- Perfect.

37:29.999 --> 37:31.999
- I don't think
I've ever had a bad meal here.

37:31.999 --> 37:33.999
- Thank you, Jesus.

37:33.999 --> 37:35.999
We just dodged an Oreo bullet.

37:35.999 --> 37:37.999
- Would anybody like
a glass of...?

37:37.999 --> 37:38.999
- Yes.

37:40.999 --> 37:43.999
- Well, actually,
he's fallen ill.

37:43.999 --> 37:44.999
- Oh. That's a bummer.

37:44.999 --> 37:45.999
- Yes. Unfortunately,

37:45.999 --> 37:48.999
Leon has fallen ill
with unemployment-itis,

37:48.999 --> 37:50.999
and there's no way
I'm bringing Rocky up here.

37:54.999 --> 37:57.999
- Hey, Kate, could you meet me
on the main deck aft, please?

37:57.999 --> 37:58.999
Ah!

37:58.999 --> 37:59.999
- Copy.

38:01.999 --> 38:03.999
- Delivery.
- Thanks.

38:03.999 --> 38:04.999
- World's heaviest cake...
- [laughs]

38:05.000 --> 38:06.999
- And I don't know what that is,
and I don't know where--

38:06.999 --> 38:09.999
- Oh. These are lava cupcakes.

38:09.999 --> 38:11.999
Holy...
- Oh.

38:11.999 --> 38:12.999
Hmm.

38:12.999 --> 38:14.999
And it's a disaster.

38:14.999 --> 38:16.999
And our sweet charter guest

38:16.999 --> 38:18.999
has never had a birthday cake
in his life.

38:18.999 --> 38:20.999
At this point,
I'm just, like, delirious.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.999
I cannot have
another thing go wrong.

38:22.999 --> 38:24.999
Look at the cake, Amy.
- Hmm.

38:24.999 --> 38:26.999
- Can we fix it with a spoon
and some whipped cream?

38:26.999 --> 38:27.999
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Okay.

38:27.999 --> 38:30.999
Maybe some love,
some shaved chocolate.

38:30.999 --> 38:31.999
- These guys are just so cool.

38:31.999 --> 38:33.999
They're people
you want to hang out with.

38:33.999 --> 38:35.999
- Everything's going
smoothly upstairs.

38:35.999 --> 38:37.999
Now, downstairs--
much different story.

38:37.999 --> 38:39.999
I just kind of fixed it
with my finger.

38:39.999 --> 38:40.999
- Do you want candles?

38:40.999 --> 38:41.999
- But I don't think
they'll notice.

38:41.999 --> 38:43.000
Yeah, we've got candles.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.999
Hopefully his eyes will be
so filled with tears of joy,

38:47.000 --> 38:49.999
he won't notice the actual state
of his birthday cake.

38:49.999 --> 38:54.999
all:
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

38:54.999 --> 38:57.999
- Whoo!

38:57.999 --> 38:58.999
[all cheering]

38:58.999 --> 39:01.999
- Happy birthday.
- Wow.

39:01.999 --> 39:02.999
[laughs]

39:02.999 --> 39:04.999
- I want to turn 50
a couple more times.

39:04.999 --> 39:05.999
[laughter]

39:05.999 --> 39:08.999
- You literally got the best
50-year-old birthday party

39:08.999 --> 39:10.999
a guy could ask for.
- No doubt.

39:10.999 --> 39:12.999
- We have one last surprise
for you on the swim platform.

39:12.999 --> 39:15.999
- I was happy with this.
That's crazy.

39:15.999 --> 39:17.999
- You guys ready?

39:18.999 --> 39:21.999
[fireworks exploding]

39:21.999 --> 39:24.999
- Whoa!
- Whoo!

39:24.999 --> 39:27.999
- Come on, fireworks?
- Oh, yeah.

39:27.999 --> 39:29.999
- I love it!

39:29.999 --> 39:32.999
- This has been the worst
24 hours on a boat in my life.

39:32.999 --> 39:35.999
I'm so relieved these guests
are finally leaving.

39:35.999 --> 39:38.999
[all cheering]

39:38.999 --> 39:42.000
- You just woke up a whole
island for your birthday.

39:42.999 --> 39:44.999
- Attention all crew.

39:44.999 --> 39:46.999
I need everybody
on the aft deck in five.

39:52.999 --> 39:55.999
- I can't even look
at you right now.

39:55.999 --> 39:56.999
- Let's go. Get it out here.
- What are you talking about?

39:56.999 --> 39:58.999
This is the rest of the crew.

39:58.999 --> 39:59.999
That's all that's left of us.
- Right?

39:59.999 --> 40:01.999
[laughter]
- Works for me.

40:01.999 --> 40:03.999
I just want to put this thing
to bed.

40:05.999 --> 40:09.999
- Junior.
- Hello.

40:09.999 --> 40:12.999
- Thank you.
- So great.

40:12.999 --> 40:15.999
- Captain Lee.
- That would be awesome.

40:15.999 --> 40:17.999
It's, like, 10:30 at night.

40:17.999 --> 40:18.999
The guests seemed happy,
but honestly,

40:18.999 --> 40:20.999
I'm just too tired
to even care,

40:20.999 --> 40:23.999
and I hope they will never
approve another late departure.

40:23.999 --> 40:24.999
- I don't know what to say.
- Happy birthday.

40:24.999 --> 40:26.999
- It's a pretty
amazing birthday, yeah?

40:26.999 --> 40:28.999
- You think?
- Once in a lifetime.

40:28.999 --> 40:33.999
And from the bottom of my heart,
from my family to you guys,

40:33.999 --> 40:34.999
thank you so much.

40:34.999 --> 40:36.999
And a little something
for you and the crew--

40:36.999 --> 40:38.999
you guys earned every dollar.

40:38.999 --> 40:40.999
It was a pretty
amazing birthday.

40:40.999 --> 40:41.999
- Glad we got to share it
with you, man.

40:41.999 --> 40:42.999
- You take care.
- See you, buddy.

40:42.999 --> 40:44.999
- All right.
- Thank you.

40:44.999 --> 40:46.999
- Bye, friends.
- Bye!

40:46.999 --> 40:49.999
- Happy birthday!
- Cheers.

40:49.999 --> 40:51.999
- Love y'all.
-	 Salud.

40:51.999 --> 40:53.999
- Let's wrap it up.
Everybody turn in.

40:53.999 --> 40:55.999
We'll do the tip meeting
in the morning.

40:56.999 --> 40:58.999
Good night.

41:09.999 --> 41:11.999
- It's so nice
to see you cook, Rocky.

41:11.999 --> 41:13.999
- Thanks, Kate.
I really enjoyed it.

41:13.999 --> 41:14.999
I had a great time doing it.

41:14.999 --> 41:19.999
This is actually what I usually
do instead of, like, do stew.

41:19.999 --> 41:20.999
- Oh.

41:20.999 --> 41:22.999
Well, Rocky...
- What? What, Kate?

41:22.999 --> 41:25.999
- That wasn't the job
that is on the boat.

41:25.999 --> 41:26.999
- Correct, Kate,
and I think I did

41:27.000 --> 41:29.999
a really frickin' awesome job

41:29.999 --> 41:33.999
stepping up
and doing the stew role.

41:33.999 --> 41:35.999
- Yeah. You did, and I've always
told you that, right?

41:35.999 --> 41:38.999
I told you you did
a great job, didn't I?

41:38.999 --> 41:40.999
- [laughs]
Oh, God.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.999
- Didn't I say
you did an amazing job,

41:42.999 --> 41:44.999
you learned really quickly,
and I was so impressed?

41:44.999 --> 41:46.999
She's just like
a ticking time bomb

41:46.999 --> 41:48.999
that I have to compliment,

41:48.999 --> 41:49.999
and even when I compliment her,

41:49.999 --> 41:51.999
I still end up
getting yelled at.

41:51.999 --> 41:55.999
- Kate, you are awesome.
You are seriously awesome.

41:55.999 --> 41:57.999
You are so awesome.
You are...

41:57.999 --> 41:58.999
- I'm really confused.
- Amazing.

41:58.999 --> 42:00.999
- I feel like you're
not being authentic.

42:00.999 --> 42:01.999
I feel like I always told you--

42:01.999 --> 42:03.999
- I'm not being authentic.
You're right.

42:03.999 --> 42:06.999
Maybe I'm not being authentic
right now.

42:06.999 --> 42:09.999
Chef left today,
and I think that was baloney.

42:09.999 --> 42:11.999
You helped
make that decision, Kate.

42:11.999 --> 42:12.999
You totally helped
make that decision,

42:12.999 --> 42:14.999
and that's where my attitude
is right now.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.999
- I don't even know
why he left.

42:16.999 --> 42:18.999
- You know what you're
really good at, Kate?

42:18.999 --> 42:20.999
You're good at these sharp,
little jabs.

42:20.999 --> 42:21.999
You're a jabber.

42:21.999 --> 42:24.999
You just jab, jab,
jab, jab, jab.

42:24.999 --> 42:26.999
"Hi, my name's Kate."
Jab.

42:26.999 --> 42:27.999
- You know
what you're really good at?

42:27.999 --> 42:29.999
- What, Kate?
Tell me.

42:29.999 --> 42:31.999
- Showing no respect
for people

42:31.999 --> 42:34.999
who have earned their position
and for positions--

42:34.999 --> 42:36.999
You need to let me finish!

42:36.999 --> 42:38.999
- When you want respect,
you got to give respect.

42:38.999 --> 42:42.999
You have been so rude
to the chef, to me.

42:42.999 --> 42:44.999
- I've been very nice to you.
- Wrong. Wrong.

42:44.999 --> 42:45.999
- If you didn't think
I was nice to you,

42:45.999 --> 42:47.999
you wouldn't still be here.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.999
- And then walk
away from a conversation,

42:49.999 --> 42:50.999
'cause I'm a child.

42:50.999 --> 42:53.999
- At this point,
Rocky is useless to me.

42:53.999 --> 42:55.999
Ain't nobody got time

42:55.999 --> 42:59.999
for Rocky and her 17 different
[bleep] personalities.

42:59.999 --> 43:02.999
- I'm done.
Done, dude.

43:02.999 --> 43:04.999
- You're [bleep] awesome.
- I'm sorry, dude.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.999
I've been trying my hardest.

43:06.999 --> 43:07.999
How long can you try?
How long can I try?

43:07.999 --> 43:09.999
- Rocky, I love you, okay?

43:09.999 --> 43:12.999
[both laughing]

43:12.999 --> 43:15.999
- Coming up...

43:15.999 --> 43:18.999
- Hello, darling.
[laughs]

43:18.999 --> 43:19.999
- What are you doing here?

43:25.999 --> 43:27.999
- How's it going?
- Going good.

43:27.999 --> 43:28.999
Lots of progress.

43:28.999 --> 43:30.999
- That looks really good,
actually.

43:30.999 --> 43:32.999
- Hi, Amy Jo.
- Hi.

43:32.999 --> 43:34.999
- How are you?

43:34.999 --> 43:35.999
- Good. How are you?
- Good.

43:35.999 --> 43:37.999
- I don't know
what to say to Rocky,

43:37.999 --> 43:39.999
because I feel like she owes us
all some sort of apology,

43:39.999 --> 43:42.999
but I don't think she realizes
she did anything wrong.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.999
- I'm having a hard time getting
in a good space with Rocky.

43:46.999 --> 43:48.999
Like, how do you go
from jumping off the boat

43:48.999 --> 43:52.999
and swimming away,
coming back like, "I'm here"?

43:53.999 --> 43:54.999
Yeah.

43:54.999 --> 43:56.999
- If Rocky's in a bad mood,

43:56.999 --> 43:58.999
it's like, "Guys, I'm not
in the mood right now."

43:58.999 --> 44:00.999
And then two seconds later,
she's like, "Hey!"

44:00.999 --> 44:02.000
- She is eternally

44:02.999 --> 44:04.999
on an emotional roller coaster
all the time,

44:04.999 --> 44:06.999
and she expects us all to go
on the ride with her.

44:06.999 --> 44:07.999
I don't care
if she apologizes.

44:07.999 --> 44:09.999

the real work.

a [bleep] bitch in the galley.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000

about what I did,

44:21.000 --> 44:22.999

44:22.999 --> 44:24.999

and ethically wrong.

44:24.999 --> 44:26.999
It goes against everything
that I stand for,

44:26.999 --> 44:29.999
but then to have
her really go off the deep end

44:29.999 --> 44:31.000
on the psychotic range...

44:31.000 --> 44:32.999
And I just want
to distance myself from her

44:32.999 --> 44:34.999
as much as I possibly can.

- No repercussions.

or she's not even, like,

44:40.999 --> 44:42.999

about it.

44:42.999 --> 44:43.999

to keep on focusing on work

44:44.000 --> 44:45.999

these next two charters.

to that entire crew

was really lovely.

You ask if you could be chef?

Oh, okay.

I'm just excited

52:53.999 --> 52:56.000
I'm really happy for you."
[laughs]

52:56.999 --> 52:57.999
- Connie is killer.

52:57.999 --> 53:01.999
She wears camo
and loves to kill fish.

53:02.999 --> 53:03.999
- You in a nutshell.
- Mm-hmm.

53:03.999 --> 53:06.999
- The hunter.
Kate the hunter.

53:06.999 --> 53:08.999
- Actually, I have been
called "the hunter."

53:08.999 --> 53:10.999
It was for a different animal.

53:10.999 --> 53:12.999
- Maybe a human?

53:12.999 --> 53:13.999
- A specific breed.

53:13.999 --> 53:15.999
- With...

53:15.999 --> 53:18.999
sort of
floppy genitalia?

53:18.999 --> 53:19.999
[laughs]

53:19.999 --> 53:21.999
- Not usually.

53:21.999 --> 53:23.999
- Not when you're around.

53:23.999 --> 53:24.999
[clicks tongue]
I like that.

53:24.999 --> 53:26.999
Here we go again.

53:26.999 --> 53:28.999
Very, very kinky.

53:28.999 --> 53:30.999
- Next time on "Below Deck"...

53:30.999 --> 53:32.999
- No, [bleep] me.

53:32.999 --> 53:34.999
I just want you
to trim the spill.

53:34.999 --> 53:36.999
- Finally I have somebody else
to put Rocky in her place.

53:36.999 --> 53:38.999
- [bleep] this.

53:38.999 --> 53:40.999
- We have co-primaries.

53:40.999 --> 53:41.999
- She's a housewife
of Atlanta.

53:41.999 --> 53:42.999
- You guys cannot tell
us "no," right?

53:42.999 --> 53:44.999
- Absolutely.
- I love South Africa.

53:44.999 --> 53:45.999
- [giggles]

53:45.999 --> 53:48.999
- Oh!
[women screaming]

53:48.999 --> 53:49.999
- I want a kitten.

53:49.999 --> 53:51.000
[laughter]

53:51.999 --> 53:52.999
- Now I want a dog.

53:52.999 --> 53:55.999
- The new deckhand's going
to be here in about 20 minutes,

53:55.999 --> 53:56.999
and it's somebody you know.

53:56.999 --> 53:58.999
- The guests canceled dinner.
- What?

53:58.999 --> 54:00.999
- They're so full
from the appetizers.

54:00.999 --> 54:02.999
- [bleep]. Kate killed dinner
with that platter.

54:02.999 --> 54:05.999
- Ben is a diva, and he
overreacts about everything.

54:05.999 --> 54:07.999
That's [bleep].
- Oh, God.

54:08.999 --> 54:10.999
- That's not my job.

54:10.999 --> 54:12.999
- Okay, you're going
to be a dick? Why?

54:15.999 --> 54:18.999
- For more "Below Deck,"
