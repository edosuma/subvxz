00:01.871 --> 00:03.046
<i>Last time on</i> Naomi...

00:03.090 --> 00:04.743
Your parents are aliens?

00:04.787 --> 00:06.789
<i>They've been lying</i> <i>
to me this whole time.</i>

00:06.832 --> 00:08.747
<i>What happened to Earth-29?</i>

00:08.791 --> 00:10.662
<i>We found out it was</i> <i>
an environmental disaster.</i>

00:10.706 --> 00:12.316
I know you're not
telling me the truth.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.709
You're right.
I have been lying.

00:13.752 --> 00:14.623
<i>About this.</i>

00:15.624 --> 00:17.582
<i>Naomi did all this.</i>

00:17.626 --> 00:19.671
<i>Brutus will send others,</i> <i>
like the bounty hunter.</i>

00:19.715 --> 00:22.109
I'm Mac.
Brutus sends his regards.

00:22.152 --> 00:23.936
<i>Unleashing her abilities</i> <i>
is the only way</i>

00:23.980 --> 00:26.548
<i>for Naomi to protect</i> <i>
the people she loves.</i>

00:26.591 --> 00:30.073
<i>Everyone Naomi knows,</i> <i>
they are all in danger now.</i>

00:32.945 --> 00:34.425
They called it
the Tear.

00:37.602 --> 00:40.823
A catastrophic
environmental event.

00:40.866 --> 00:42.303
Zumbado told me about it, but,

00:43.478 --> 00:44.870
I didn't realize it had a name.

00:46.611 --> 00:48.178
It gave the Twenty-Nine
their powers.

00:49.919 --> 00:51.486
That's right.

00:51.529 --> 00:53.183
Are you members
of the Twenty-Nine?

00:53.227 --> 00:54.663
No.

00:54.706 --> 00:57.666
Back on our home planet,
we were scientists.

00:57.709 --> 01:01.844
We were called in to fix
the Tear, but we failed.

01:01.887 --> 01:04.629
That doesn't explain
how we ended up here.

01:04.673 --> 01:07.719
And it doesn't explain
how you adopted me
and all your lies.

01:07.763 --> 01:10.374
Did Zumbado tell you
about Brutus?

01:10.418 --> 01:12.507
He terrorizes
the people of our planet.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.379
He hunted the Twenty-Nine.

01:16.815 --> 01:17.903
That's why we lied.

01:19.644 --> 01:21.298
Because we never
wanted that for you.

01:21.342 --> 01:24.345
Neither did your birth parents.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.610
You knew my birth parents?

01:29.263 --> 01:30.133
Yeah.

01:31.526 --> 01:32.396
We did, pumpkin.

01:34.137 --> 01:35.356
So you lied about that, too.

01:39.229 --> 01:41.362
A lot of bad things happened
back then.

01:42.363 --> 01:43.755
We wanted to spare you.

01:45.714 --> 01:48.108
No disrespect,
but bad things
isn't good enough.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.110
I deserve the truth.

02:02.034 --> 02:04.994
After Brutus rose to power,
there was political mayhem.

02:06.648 --> 02:07.475
Violence.

02:09.607 --> 02:12.219
Chaos beyond your imagination.

02:12.262 --> 02:13.394
It was truly horrific.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.398
We lived in fear.

02:17.441 --> 02:19.226
No one could stop him.

02:19.269 --> 02:21.489
That's what your birth parents
wanted to protect you from.

02:21.532 --> 02:24.231
That's what we wanted
to protect you from.

02:24.274 --> 02:26.015
We promised them
if anything happened to them,

02:26.058 --> 02:28.060
we'd... hide you.

02:28.104 --> 02:29.061
We'd keep you safe.

02:38.723 --> 02:39.811
What happened to them?

02:41.030 --> 02:42.553
We don't know.

02:42.597 --> 02:43.685
Did Brutus get to them?

02:49.125 --> 02:49.995
No more lies.

02:52.694 --> 02:53.564
Yes.

02:54.913 --> 02:55.784
We believe he did.

03:06.838 --> 03:10.059
Zumbado says I'm the only one
who can beat Brutus.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.583
He says it's my destiny.

03:14.063 --> 03:15.107
Is that true?

03:15.151 --> 03:17.022
Your powers are one of a kind.

03:18.285 --> 03:19.460
There's no denying that.

03:22.071 --> 03:23.551
And there's no hiding it anymore.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.685
Maybe we should
never have tried.

03:35.084 --> 03:36.216
If you wanna run,

03:37.565 --> 03:39.088
we'll run.

03:39.131 --> 03:40.132
Hard and fast.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.222
If you wanna fight,

03:43.397 --> 03:44.267
we'll fight.

03:47.531 --> 03:48.663
Hard and fast.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.855
<i>♪ I don't wanna be</i> <i>
Your friend ♪</i>

04:06.898 --> 04:08.465
<i>♪ You don't wanna be</i> <i>
My friend ♪</i>

04:08.509 --> 04:11.076
So you're basically
the Harry Potter of space?

04:11.120 --> 04:12.991
- I don't know about that.
- You're right.

04:13.035 --> 04:14.602
That sucker had seven books

04:14.645 --> 04:15.733
to figure out his destiny.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.039
You've had, what, three months?

04:17.082 --> 04:19.302
It all just seems so crazy.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.435
I haven't even graduated
from high school.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.263
Harry hadn't graduated either.

04:23.306 --> 04:24.133
Which ones?

04:28.355 --> 04:29.965
All I know is I just

04:30.008 --> 04:31.836
lowkey don't wanna think about
any of this tonight.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.143
I just wanna have a normal prom
like a normal teenager.

04:34.186 --> 04:35.449
I fully support that.

04:35.492 --> 04:36.667
How are we doing
on the checklist?

04:37.799 --> 04:39.191
Manicures, check.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.715
Sheet masks, check.

04:40.758 --> 04:42.282
Jewelry selection, check.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.589
Light yoga session?

04:45.633 --> 04:47.765
So we can be properly stretched
before hitting the dance floor.

04:47.809 --> 04:50.942
Yeah, I now understand
why you budgeted six hours
for pre-prom prep.

04:50.986 --> 04:52.727
Beauty is a harsh mistress.

04:57.079 --> 04:58.733
I am guessing from that smile

04:58.776 --> 05:00.343
that things are going better
with Nathan?

05:00.387 --> 05:02.258
We're getting there.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.347
I think he's still
a little bit upset about
what happened.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.088
Which part?

05:06.131 --> 05:07.829
The part about you accusing him
of stealing the disc

05:07.872 --> 05:09.657
or the part where you posted
those selfies with Lourdes

05:09.700 --> 05:11.267
to make him jealous?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.008
- Probably both.
- Not helping.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.184
Sorry.

05:15.227 --> 05:16.272
Tonight is about fixing things.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.883
We're just gonna dance, vibe,

05:18.927 --> 05:20.972
and hopefully go back to
the way that things used to be.

05:26.195 --> 05:27.501
Hey, man.

05:27.544 --> 05:28.937
Will my little sister
like this one?

05:30.678 --> 05:32.114
Yeah, sure.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.681
I don't know.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.639
<i>Swamp Thing</i> might be too slimy.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.815
She'll like... this one better.

05:38.555 --> 05:40.122
Cool. Thanks.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.037
I'm Nathan.

05:42.690 --> 05:43.517
Naomi.

05:44.866 --> 05:46.737
I've never seen you
in here before.

05:47.564 --> 05:48.565
Yeah, my mom

05:48.609 --> 05:50.262
just got transferred to town

05:50.306 --> 05:52.264
and my little sister is bummed.

05:53.657 --> 05:54.658
I'm not really into comics,

05:54.702 --> 05:55.920
but she likes them

05:55.964 --> 05:57.269
for some reason.

05:57.313 --> 05:58.793
Yeah, because comics
are the best.

05:58.836 --> 06:00.360
Sure, if you're a kid.

06:00.403 --> 06:03.537
But anyone over the age of ten
who's into comics

06:03.580 --> 06:05.103
is obviously...

06:08.193 --> 06:10.065
You gonna finish your sentence?

06:10.108 --> 06:11.153
I was gonna say dope.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.636
You know how many <i>
Superman</i> comics have been sold?

06:16.811 --> 06:18.290
Six hundred million.

06:18.334 --> 06:20.771
Superman stands
for truth and justice.

06:20.815 --> 06:23.644
He provides a way for us all
to feel like ourselves.

06:23.687 --> 06:26.647
You get inspiration from a dude
who flies around
fighting aliens?

06:26.690 --> 06:28.649
It doesn't really matter
if he's real or not.

06:28.692 --> 06:29.693
He's still a hero.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.392
Not really my kind of hero.

06:32.435 --> 06:35.177
Also, he's an adult
wearing a cape.

06:36.961 --> 06:38.659
You're entitled
to your opinion.

06:38.702 --> 06:40.051
Even if it's completely wrong.

06:40.095 --> 06:41.923
Hold up. Are you mad?

06:41.966 --> 06:42.793
Like for real?

06:43.968 --> 06:44.969
I was messing with you.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.190
I gotta go.

06:48.233 --> 06:50.148
But I hope your little sister
enjoys the comic.

07:01.159 --> 07:02.726
I wonder when
the girls will be ready.

07:02.770 --> 07:03.771
It's important to be respectful

07:03.814 --> 07:04.946
of women and their time.

07:04.989 --> 07:06.426
- So much respect.
- Yes, sir. Yeah.

07:06.469 --> 07:07.557
Do you know
I'm in the military?

07:08.602 --> 07:09.777
Uh...

07:09.820 --> 07:11.779
Go easy on them, Greg.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.258
Ah, here they come.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.444
Wow.

07:24.487 --> 07:28.883
I promise to avoid
another stabbing incident
like last year's winter formal.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.668
I still have the scar,
but it makes me smile.

07:48.598 --> 07:50.295
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:51.645 --> 07:52.907
You look incredible.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.474
Thank you. You, too.

07:56.519 --> 07:57.694
Uh, this is for you.

08:01.393 --> 08:03.004
Who's ready for a photo?

08:03.047 --> 08:04.396
Come on. Let's get together.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.789
Guys.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.099
One, two, three, smile.

08:16.452 --> 08:19.237
Excuse me. Right here.

08:19.281 --> 08:23.415
I can't believe Esme spent
our entire prom budget
on a nature reserve.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.635
Is anyone really surprised
at the low turnout?

08:25.679 --> 08:27.681
I'm not really clear
on the theme.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.987
Something for everyone.
Like Coachella.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.381
This is definitely
not Coachella.

08:39.257 --> 08:40.171
Hi.

09:21.604 --> 09:22.953
It's called resonance.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.651
Stop.

09:24.694 --> 09:27.044
I have a message from Brutus.
He wants you to join him.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.177
You okay?

09:29.917 --> 09:30.787
Yeah.

09:45.106 --> 09:47.108
- My texts aren't going through.
- Me neither.

09:47.151 --> 09:48.588
What could have caused
a blackout

09:48.631 --> 09:50.198
and for our phones to go down?

09:50.241 --> 09:52.330
It wasn't a storm.

09:52.374 --> 09:54.289
That would be
more consistent with, like,
an electromagnetic pulse.

09:54.332 --> 09:55.943
An EMP.

09:55.986 --> 09:59.163
So maybe it was an accident
at the military base?

09:59.207 --> 10:02.645
Maybe. But I heard
this, like, strange hum.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.821
Last time I heard that
was at STAR Labs.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.562
Could you tell
where it was coming from?

10:06.606 --> 10:08.999
Uh, pinpointing the source
could help us identify it.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.132
Not exactly.

10:11.175 --> 10:12.046
I think it was somewhere
near the bathroom--

10:12.089 --> 10:13.395
The DJ has power.

10:13.438 --> 10:14.962
Let's get back
to dancing, people.

10:16.137 --> 10:18.095
We need to check the bathroom.

10:18.139 --> 10:20.489
Didn't you guys
go to the bathroom,
like, 20 minutes ago?

10:20.532 --> 10:23.971
Uh, we just needed
to freshen up.

10:24.014 --> 10:25.799
Don't question
the sacred prom ritual

10:25.842 --> 10:27.235
of group trips
to the ladies' room.

10:28.932 --> 10:29.803
We'll be right back.

10:37.985 --> 10:38.942
Major McDuffie.

10:41.075 --> 10:43.512
Good to see you, sir.
I thought you'd gone back
to Quantico.

10:43.555 --> 10:46.341
Well, after the Steel incident,
the DOD expressed some concern

10:46.384 --> 10:48.386
about the effectiveness
of this task force.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.780
You're evaluating us.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.782
I wouldn't put it
in those terms.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.349
But that's not why
I called you.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.264
There's been an incident
at STAR Labs.

10:56.307 --> 10:57.831
You familiar with it?

10:57.874 --> 10:59.659
Well, only in passing, sir.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.704
We've been monitoring it
since the Steel incident.

11:01.748 --> 11:04.533
Tonight there was
a significant energy spike.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.491
Agent Davis,
the team is in position.

11:06.535 --> 11:07.928
Put it on the screen.

11:07.971 --> 11:10.060
There's a team on the ground
ready to breach.

11:10.104 --> 11:12.628
They've isolated the incident
to a specific lab.

11:12.672 --> 11:16.197
Records indicate
it belonged to a Dr. Bell.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.025
What are we expecting
to find, sir?

11:18.068 --> 11:19.417
That's a good question.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.945
<i>We're in position, sir.</i>

11:24.988 --> 11:26.598
<i>No signs of life or activity.</i>

11:27.512 --> 11:28.383
<i>On your call.</i>

11:29.384 --> 11:30.341
Go.

11:32.648 --> 11:34.215
<i>Dynamic entry, in.</i>

11:34.258 --> 11:35.825
<i>Let's go.</i>

11:35.869 --> 11:37.697
<i>With me!</i> <i>
Let's go. Let's go.</i>

11:37.740 --> 11:38.741
<i>Move! Move!</i>

11:38.785 --> 11:40.656
<i>Breach!</i>

11:40.700 --> 11:42.963
- <i>Clear!</i>
- <i>Clear!</i>

11:43.006 --> 11:44.355
<i>Looks good.</i>

11:44.399 --> 11:45.966
Do you have anything,
Alpha Leader?

11:46.009 --> 11:46.706
<i>There's</i> <i>
some kind of device.</i>

11:48.664 --> 11:50.405
<i>Is that a force field?</i>

11:50.448 --> 11:51.275
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- They need to get out of there.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.755
Now!

11:52.799 --> 11:53.843
<i>Everybody,</i> <i>
let's move! Go!</i>

12:04.506 --> 12:05.725
I think I found something.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.140
What the hell is that?

12:32.229 --> 12:34.144
I think it's a force field.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.712
An alien force field?

12:37.452 --> 12:38.758
I don't know,

12:38.801 --> 12:40.585
but we need to contact
some adults.

12:40.629 --> 12:43.240
Preferably one with wings.
Or one who's perpetually salty.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.859
Zumbado is the closest.
I can be back in ten minutes.

12:52.902 --> 12:53.947
What am I supposed to do then?

12:54.730 --> 12:56.036
Act normal.

12:56.079 --> 12:57.254
Act normal. Right. Okay.

13:02.085 --> 13:03.870
Nice reflexes, babe.

13:03.913 --> 13:04.784
Are you okay?

13:07.003 --> 13:08.265
I'm pretty sure we're trapped.

13:16.099 --> 13:17.927
I don't know
what's more incredible.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.407
This force field,

13:19.450 --> 13:21.888
or the fact that
I'm in the girls' bathroom.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.761
I mean, this place
is so much cleaner.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.197
Separate bathrooms
are so Gen X.

13:27.241 --> 13:28.938
- The future is all-gender.
- Agreed.

13:28.982 --> 13:31.549
But we can't fight for equality
until we get out of here.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.901
Brutus only wants me.

13:34.944 --> 13:37.033
Why would he
go to the trouble of trapping
the entire junior class?

13:37.077 --> 13:39.427
And what if prom
turns into a <i>Carrie</i> situation?

13:39.470 --> 13:41.864
Or worse.
What if it gets boring?

13:41.908 --> 13:43.431
Okay, there is
still two hours left

13:43.474 --> 13:44.911
and they're out of good songs.

13:44.954 --> 13:46.651
Which means
we only have two hours

13:46.695 --> 13:49.089
until people try to leave
and realize they,

13:49.829 --> 13:51.831
you know, can't.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.007
We have to find a way
to contact someone.

13:54.050 --> 13:55.922
We could call Dee
on his CB radio

13:55.965 --> 13:58.054
using morse code
or hieroglyphics.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.014
Annabelle, you're a genius.

14:01.057 --> 14:03.407
There's a CB radio
in the office. We can use that.

14:03.451 --> 14:05.888
I think this force field
will dampen the signal.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.281
Not if we use a linear amp.

14:07.324 --> 14:08.848
It will upgrade
the power output.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.024
That DJ did bring
an excessive amount of gear.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.156
I mean, who does the guy
think he is? Skrillex?

14:13.200 --> 14:14.984
I'll get the amp
and meet you guys
in the office.

14:28.519 --> 14:29.607
Shh, shh.

14:31.348 --> 14:33.481
Breaking into
the school office...

14:33.524 --> 14:36.353
We're living so dangerously.

14:36.397 --> 14:37.920
I can't believe
I'm in here by choice.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.314
After hours.

14:40.357 --> 14:43.099
During prom night.

14:43.143 --> 14:47.582
Speaking of, I know
this wasn't exactly the prom
you had in mind.

14:47.625 --> 14:48.496
Nope.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.499
It's way better.

14:51.542 --> 14:52.848
This is fun.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.676
This spy stuff
is kind of romantic.

14:54.719 --> 14:57.635
We're like <i>Mr. & Mrs. Smith.</i>
From classic movie night?

14:57.679 --> 15:00.247
But weren't those two
trying to kill each other?

15:00.290 --> 15:03.119
I would never take a job
to assassinate you, hon.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.773
Aw, hon.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.383
I wouldn't take a job
to assassinate you either.

15:09.560 --> 15:10.431
Oh, I see it.

15:12.563 --> 15:13.825
Raincheck on the kissing

15:13.869 --> 15:15.653
till after we defeat
the aliens?

15:15.697 --> 15:16.567
Definitely.

15:29.145 --> 15:31.365
I've been waiting for you
in the Winter Wonderland room.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.584
Your snow cone
is pretty much melted.

15:35.282 --> 15:36.239
I'm sorry, Nathan.

15:37.327 --> 15:39.373
What's going on with you?

15:39.416 --> 15:41.070
This was supposed to be
our night.

15:43.594 --> 15:45.509
Jacob has this
really big robotics project

15:45.553 --> 15:47.424
and I was just
trying to help him.

15:47.468 --> 15:49.470
Homework during prom?

15:49.513 --> 15:51.037
I know. It's lame.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.130
Can we just
forget about all this

15:57.173 --> 15:58.435
and go back to having fun?

15:58.479 --> 16:00.481
Yeah, that's what I want.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.962
You, me,
having fun like we used to.

16:04.311 --> 16:05.138
But?

16:06.791 --> 16:09.098
I'm not sure
that's what you want.

16:09.142 --> 16:11.231
It... It is, Nathan. I promise.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.366
I don't know
what you want me to say.

16:18.325 --> 16:19.326
That makes the two of us.

16:25.506 --> 16:26.724
- Hey!
- Hey.

16:33.644 --> 16:35.342
I can't believe Greg and Jen

16:35.385 --> 16:37.735
let you have a party
while they're out of town.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.215
Coolest parents ever.

16:39.259 --> 16:40.825
Yeah, they really are
the best.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.003
- Who is that?
- Who?

16:45.613 --> 16:47.136
Oh.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.660
That's Nathan.
I met him at Levon's last week.

16:49.704 --> 16:52.011
That's the guy
who insulted Superman?

16:52.054 --> 16:55.144
You neglected to mention
that he is fine.

16:55.188 --> 16:57.190
Because I don't care
what he looks like.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.279
He's a rude jock
and I'm not interested.

16:59.322 --> 17:01.194
Really?

17:01.237 --> 17:02.804
Yeah, that feeling
is not mutual,

17:02.847 --> 17:05.024
because that boy
is straight up staring at you.

17:07.939 --> 17:10.116
And coming over this way.

17:11.117 --> 17:12.466
Look who it is.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.598
Annabelle. Hi. It's Annabelle.

17:14.642 --> 17:16.644
- Uh, I'm Annabelle. Hello.
- Oh.

17:16.687 --> 17:18.994
And good... goodbye. I'm...
I'm gonna get some pizza.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.955
Hey, thanks
for the recommendation.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.088
Little sis loved the comic.

17:26.132 --> 17:29.439
Oh, of course, 'cause
she's an actual child, right?

17:29.483 --> 17:31.833
I think you got
the wrong impression of me.

17:31.876 --> 17:35.967
I'm actually
kind of an okay guy
once you get to know me.

17:36.011 --> 17:38.318
And what makes you think
I wanna get to know you?

17:38.361 --> 17:40.798
Well,
maybe the fact that we keep
running into each other?

17:40.842 --> 17:43.279
Some people
might call that fate.

17:43.323 --> 17:46.282
I call it living
in a small town.

17:46.326 --> 17:49.459
Must be a nice change after
all that moving around, though.

17:49.503 --> 17:52.549
Being an Army brat
can be tough. I know.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.551
How'd you know
I'm an Army brat?

17:54.595 --> 17:55.422
I did my homework.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.600
You think I ended up
at this party by accident?

18:00.775 --> 18:02.559
You just called it fate.

18:02.603 --> 18:05.040
Fate means
you're supposed to be
in a certain place

18:05.084 --> 18:07.173
with a certain person
at a certain time.

18:08.739 --> 18:10.089
Fate is never an accident.

18:11.394 --> 18:12.917
That's shockingly insightful.

18:12.961 --> 18:14.005
I'm full of surprises.

18:15.006 --> 18:15.833
Okay.

18:16.530 --> 18:19.315
Army brat,

18:19.359 --> 18:22.013
how many times
have you changed schools
in the middle of the year?

18:22.057 --> 18:23.493
Three, including now.

18:24.494 --> 18:26.801
I did four. It's the worst.

18:26.844 --> 18:27.889
So bad.

18:29.630 --> 18:30.631
Can I get you a drink?

18:32.459 --> 18:34.765
This is my party, but yes,

18:35.636 --> 18:36.550
you can.

18:44.079 --> 18:46.168
Are you taking a picture?

18:46.212 --> 18:48.170
I definitely thought
there would be a lot less
science stuff at prom,

18:48.214 --> 18:49.954
but, uh, memories are memories.

18:49.998 --> 18:51.173
Got it.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.348
Signal officially boosted.

18:54.872 --> 18:57.788
Dee, it's Naomi. Are you there?

18:57.832 --> 18:59.964
I think the correct terminology
is "come in."

19:01.923 --> 19:03.446
Dee, it's Naomi. Come in, Dee.

19:09.191 --> 19:10.149
<i>Are you there?</i>

19:11.019 --> 19:12.063
<i>Come in, Dee.</i>

19:13.282 --> 19:14.936
Maybe he's not there.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.548
<i>Naomi, what's wrong?</i>

19:19.897 --> 19:22.509
Yes, uh, Dee, we're at school

19:22.552 --> 19:24.163
and there's some kind
of force field.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.295
<i>It's not exactly a force field.</i>

19:28.515 --> 19:31.257
<i>Naomi, I'm coming there.</i> <i>
Stay there.</i>

19:31.300 --> 19:32.258
Dee?

19:33.302 --> 19:34.651
Dee?

19:34.695 --> 19:35.957
<i>Dee can't hear you</i> <i>
anymore.</i>

19:39.352 --> 19:41.223
<i>Brutus sends his regards.</i>

19:47.186 --> 19:48.230
Who is this?

19:48.274 --> 19:49.840
<i>My name's Julian,</i>

19:49.884 --> 19:51.712
<i>but you're asking</i> <i>
the wrong question.</i>

19:51.755 --> 19:54.410
<i>The right question is,</i> <i>
where am I?</i>

19:59.850 --> 20:03.941
<i>Meet me</i> <i>
in the East Wing, alone,</i>

20:03.985 --> 20:07.293
<i>or everyone at this prom</i> <i>
will wish they'd never</i> <i>
been born.</i>

20:13.908 --> 20:16.519
Julian trapped everyone in here
just to get to me.

20:16.563 --> 20:19.043
You said Dee's wings
can sense aliens.

20:20.175 --> 20:22.046
Maybe the adults
are on their way.

20:22.090 --> 20:24.179
But if we can't get out,
how can they get in?

20:29.358 --> 20:31.230
- Nathan.
- What the hell is going on?

20:34.363 --> 20:35.538
Are you okay? What's wrong?

20:36.757 --> 20:38.411
I'm fine. It's nothing.

20:38.454 --> 20:39.760
Why won't you just tell me?

20:43.851 --> 20:45.244
You know what? I'm leaving.

20:47.507 --> 20:48.725
Nathan, wait!

20:52.990 --> 20:55.906
- Don't go, please. Just talk to me.
- Talk to you?

20:55.950 --> 21:00.650
So you can ignore me?
Ditch me? Lie to my face again?
Nah, I'm good.

21:00.694 --> 21:03.697
Nathan, stop!

21:03.740 --> 21:06.830
I know tonight's been weird,
but I have a good reason.
Can you please just trust me?

21:06.874 --> 21:10.138
Why should I trust you?
You obviously don't trust me.

21:14.447 --> 21:19.321
You know what?
This isn't working.

21:19.365 --> 21:24.587
- What are you saying?
- Exactly what I said. This, us... It isn't working.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.207
There's a force field
surrounding the entire school
and we're all trapped in here.

21:38.732 --> 21:40.211
Right.

21:41.474 --> 21:42.953
You need
to work on your excuse game.

21:54.835 --> 21:55.836
You're serious?

22:02.059 --> 22:05.976
That force field is here
to keep me inside.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.283
There's someone
in the school right now.
They want to hurt me.

22:11.112 --> 22:12.722
Why would someone
want to hurt you?

22:18.946 --> 22:21.644
I found out I'm not from here.

22:23.037 --> 22:24.386
I know that.

22:24.430 --> 22:25.866
You've moved around a lot.
So have I.

22:27.824 --> 22:28.912
It's different than that.

22:31.915 --> 22:34.657
There are things
I haven't told you
about myself.

22:36.572 --> 22:37.878
Things I've been keeping
from you.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.577
I know that, too.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.579
I keep hoping you'll tell me
when you're ready.

22:46.277 --> 22:52.066
I found out that my parents
didn't adopt me. They found me.

22:53.110 --> 22:54.024
What does that mean?

22:55.635 --> 22:59.116
They found me as an infant,

22:59.160 --> 23:06.080
alone, on a rock, in the forest
with... alien markings.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.653
The markings were from
another planet.

23:15.829 --> 23:17.004
The planet where I'm from.

23:19.136 --> 23:20.834
What are you saying right now?

23:21.965 --> 23:23.576
I'm not from here, Nathan.

23:24.925 --> 23:26.492
I'm from another planet.

23:27.710 --> 23:28.711
I'm not human.

23:30.147 --> 23:32.149
I'm something else.

23:32.193 --> 23:35.892
Wait, what? I don't understand.

23:37.981 --> 23:39.809
I don't either.

23:39.853 --> 23:43.596
And I'm... I've been trying
to accept it and understand it,

23:43.639 --> 23:45.946
but,
I can't.

23:47.469 --> 23:49.340
And I'm so scared, and I--

23:55.825 --> 23:57.131
I've wanted to tell you.

23:59.133 --> 24:02.266
But I was scared you wouldn't
understand or accept me.

24:06.053 --> 24:07.271
I'm still afraid of that.

24:13.408 --> 24:15.454
I don't understand any of this.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.589
But, I'm here.

24:29.250 --> 24:34.734
After Naomi called,
I went to the school
and checked every entrance.

24:34.777 --> 24:37.519
All of them are blocked by
the same type of energy field.

24:38.825 --> 24:40.914
We have to get inside.

24:40.957 --> 24:44.091
That's Earth-29 tech.
The force field
is virtually impenetrable.

24:44.134 --> 24:45.788
My daughter is trapped
in there.

24:47.529 --> 24:50.576
This is your fault.
We never wanted this for her.

24:50.619 --> 24:52.621
If you had left her alone,
this wouldn't be happening.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.057
With all due respect,

24:54.101 --> 24:55.711
I'm the one
who told Naomi the truth.

24:55.755 --> 24:58.845
Naomi's powers were starting
to manifest.

24:58.888 --> 25:01.195
There was no hiding it,
no denying it. You know that.

25:01.238 --> 25:03.980
I don't care if I have to
call in the entire military
and bomb that building,

25:04.024 --> 25:05.199
we're getting Naomi out.

25:07.636 --> 25:09.333
There could be another way.

25:09.377 --> 25:11.771
Greg, the device
on the quantum machine,

25:11.814 --> 25:13.512
tell me what you saw
before the feed went dark.

25:14.513 --> 25:15.339
Not much.

25:16.732 --> 25:18.255
When the soldiers got close,

25:18.299 --> 25:19.735
a force field activated
and blew them back.

25:21.868 --> 25:23.957
I believe this is Mac.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.263
I've seen her use technology
like this.

25:26.307 --> 25:27.787
Who the hell is Mac?

25:27.830 --> 25:31.878
She works for Brutus.
Part of his inner circle.

25:31.921 --> 25:33.880
- If they're making a move--
- She's not alone.

25:36.012 --> 25:37.361
You know who's with her.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.102
Not for certain,

25:39.146 --> 25:42.192
but I suspect that Brutus
has sent someone
more formidable.

25:42.236 --> 25:43.585
He goes by Julian.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.413
I've never heard of him.

25:45.456 --> 25:49.243
Julian is a high-level enforcer
He flies under the radar.

25:49.286 --> 25:52.638
They're isolating Naomi.
Attacking her when
she's most vulnerable.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.903
How do we bring down
the force field?

25:56.946 --> 26:00.210
It's connected
to whatever device
is on that quantum machine.

26:00.254 --> 26:02.604
We have to get inside
and destroy it.

26:02.648 --> 26:05.651
Bell's lab has been sealed off.
There are soldiers everywhere.

26:05.694 --> 26:07.391
There's another way
into that lab.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.133
I'll need your Nth metal.

26:10.177 --> 26:12.571
Shutting down that device
will take time.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.442
How do we protect Naomi?

26:14.485 --> 26:17.401
Until we get there,
Naomi's going to
have to protect herself.

26:24.278 --> 26:26.280
It's nice to have another bro
in the know.

26:27.673 --> 26:30.589
Look at us!
The fearsome foursome.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.286
What are we going to do?

26:32.329 --> 26:34.593
Well, we will definitely
not be sending you on a meeting

26:34.636 --> 26:37.378
with a psychotic assassin
in the East Wing.

26:37.421 --> 26:39.293
I don't have much of a choice.

26:39.336 --> 26:40.903
Seriously, babe,

26:40.947 --> 26:42.688
I will lock you
in this classroom if I have to.

26:42.731 --> 26:46.126
How can we stop this Julian guy
from doing whatever

26:46.169 --> 26:47.736
to the rest of the people
at prom?

26:47.780 --> 26:50.521
We need to buy time
before the adults come.

26:50.565 --> 26:53.829
I've said it before.
What this school needs
is a good panic room.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.877
What if we made our own?

26:57.920 --> 26:59.400
If we get everybody
in the same location,

26:59.443 --> 27:01.184
we could make sure
they're safe.

27:01.228 --> 27:04.100
I am so on board with this
"hide until help comes" plan.

27:04.144 --> 27:06.929
Winter Wonderland
might be big enough
to hold everyone.

27:06.973 --> 27:09.236
Then, all we need to do
is get everybody in there

27:09.279 --> 27:12.282
and keep them away
from Julian, until...

27:14.241 --> 27:16.112
TBD.

27:16.156 --> 27:18.637
We can handle that,
now that we're
a four-person team.

27:25.208 --> 27:27.254
Come on.

27:27.297 --> 27:29.343
You won't want to miss this.
Winter Wonderland
is about to be lit.

27:29.386 --> 27:32.912
Yep. And don't sleep
on our sno-cone mixologist.

27:32.955 --> 27:35.610
Oh, it's a rainbow!

27:35.654 --> 27:39.135
What up, Port Oswego juniors!

27:41.224 --> 27:44.010
Guys, we are about to make
prom history.

27:44.053 --> 27:48.014
I'm talking
a special musical guest
that will blow your minds!

27:48.057 --> 27:49.711
Whoo!

27:49.755 --> 27:51.582
So don't go anywhere.
You do not want to miss this.

27:51.626 --> 27:52.888
I'm head of
the prom committee

27:52.932 --> 27:55.456
and I do not approve
this message.

27:55.499 --> 27:59.329
Everybody,
make some noise
if you want Esme to chill!

27:59.373 --> 28:01.375
Well, it looks like Annabelle could use some back-up.

28:01.418 --> 28:03.333
Yeah. Uh, you go.

28:03.377 --> 28:05.684
I'll stay and get
the stragglers inside.
I'll be right there.

28:10.601 --> 28:13.866
- It's not SZA.
- It's not <i>not</i> SZA!

28:13.909 --> 28:16.085
Esme. The DJ's freaking out.

28:16.129 --> 28:18.784
He said you never gave him
the second deposit,
so he's gonna bounce.

28:18.827 --> 28:20.960
What? I have a signed invoice.

28:23.049 --> 28:24.137
Nice work, newbie.

28:26.052 --> 28:28.924
Those people are
sno-cone savages.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.273
Where's Naomi?

28:30.317 --> 28:32.319
In the hallway
with the stragglers.

28:32.362 --> 28:33.929
No, she's not.
The hallway's empty.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.890
She's going to the East Wing.

28:37.933 --> 28:39.630
I knew we should have put her
on sno-cone duty.

28:58.084 --> 28:59.738
So you're Naomi.

29:05.656 --> 29:07.006
You're brave to come alone.

29:08.181 --> 29:09.922
I'm the one Brutus wants.

29:09.965 --> 29:12.315
Do you really think
you can save everyone?

29:12.359 --> 29:13.752
Your classmates,

29:15.101 --> 29:16.798
your friends.

29:16.842 --> 29:19.192
Annabelle, Jacob,

29:21.672 --> 29:22.630
Nathan.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.067
This isn't about them.

29:25.111 --> 29:27.853
Actually, it is.

29:27.896 --> 29:31.813
They're trapped
behind a force field
in the doorway.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.249
Your friends went looking
for you.

29:34.555 --> 29:36.470
That made it very easy for me.

29:36.513 --> 29:37.601
Let them go.

29:37.645 --> 29:39.778
You have
a lot of friends, Naomi.

29:39.821 --> 29:42.824
Your parents, Dee, Zumbado.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.957
People who will try
to protect you.

29:46.262 --> 29:47.655
What I want to see is

29:47.698 --> 29:50.049
who you are
with none of them around.

30:10.156 --> 30:11.897
If this works,

30:11.940 --> 30:14.508
the energy released
will create an explosion

30:14.551 --> 30:17.119
and shut down
the force field at the school.

30:17.163 --> 30:19.034
- You ready?
- Ready.

30:31.133 --> 30:33.919
The containment field
destabilizes your energy wave.

30:33.962 --> 30:36.312
We learned a few things
after your meeting with Mac.

30:36.356 --> 30:39.315
Now.

30:42.928 --> 30:45.931
- Why are you doing this?
- I'm giving you a choice.

30:45.974 --> 30:49.369
You can save your friends,
or your classmates.

30:49.412 --> 30:52.502
Both are trapped
behind energy fields
that will incinerate them.

30:54.026 --> 30:57.377
This deactivates one,
but sets off the other.

30:58.465 --> 31:00.032
You get to choose.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.040
I'm not doing that.

31:09.693 --> 31:11.478
That's how long
you have to decide.

31:18.528 --> 31:19.878
Why was there no explosion?

31:21.140 --> 31:23.142
Because this is a decoy.

31:23.185 --> 31:24.360
Naomi's on her own.

31:29.061 --> 31:30.149
Please don't do this.

31:32.586 --> 31:33.804
It's already done.

31:45.642 --> 31:46.905
Naomi! You're okay!

31:47.993 --> 31:49.820
Not exactly.

31:49.864 --> 31:51.474
This energy field is going to

31:51.518 --> 31:53.389
incinerate all of you
in about three minutes.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.130
Same for everyone else.
They're stuck in one, too.

31:58.351 --> 31:59.874
This is the worst prom ever.

32:02.616 --> 32:04.835
This will deactivate
the force field.

32:04.879 --> 32:06.315
I just have to turn it.

32:06.359 --> 32:08.230
Okay, good.

32:08.274 --> 32:10.624
I did not want my last moments
on Earth to be spent in school.

32:12.843 --> 32:15.020
What's the catch?

32:15.063 --> 32:16.804
Touching one
triggers the other.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.851
He's making me choose.

32:20.895 --> 32:24.725
He's making me choose
between you and everyone else
at prom.

32:24.768 --> 32:25.944
I don't know what to do.

32:27.554 --> 32:29.295
Yes, you do.

32:29.338 --> 32:31.123
There's three of us
and fifty of them.

32:31.950 --> 32:32.994
It's an easy call.

32:40.741 --> 32:42.134
Hold on.

32:42.177 --> 32:44.527
This is technically
a dead man's switch.

32:46.486 --> 32:47.835
It... It works on a relay.

32:47.878 --> 32:52.013
It seems instantaneous
but it's not.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.710
It still has to send out
an alert

32:53.754 --> 32:55.930
that activates the other field.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.279
I really hope
all this science talk

32:57.323 --> 32:58.585
ends with us not dying.

32:59.803 --> 33:01.022
If I can touch the second field

33:01.066 --> 33:03.024
before the alert
makes it from the first,

33:03.068 --> 33:04.939
I can deactivate both.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.897
Jacob, how long would I have?

33:06.941 --> 33:08.203
Probably a second.

33:11.250 --> 33:12.860
From one end of the school
to the other

33:12.903 --> 33:14.166
in less than a second?

33:15.863 --> 33:17.517
That seems impossible.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.388
You'd have to be Superman
to do that.

33:19.432 --> 33:20.607
I'm not Superman.

33:20.650 --> 33:22.304
No. You're not.

33:22.348 --> 33:24.959
You're Naomi freaking McDuffie.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.265
You just have to believe it.

34:26.499 --> 34:27.587
- Naomi!
- Are you okay?

34:27.630 --> 34:28.762
Babe, are you okay?

34:28.805 --> 34:29.893
I did it.

34:45.692 --> 34:48.129
Oh, baby, are you okay?

34:48.173 --> 34:50.218
Yeah, Mom, I'm... I'm fine.
We're all fine.

34:52.786 --> 34:54.962
The force field came down,
but Julian disappeared.

34:55.005 --> 34:56.006
Did you guys find him?

34:56.616 --> 34:57.878
No.

34:57.921 --> 34:59.445
But why would Julian
just leave?

34:59.488 --> 35:01.186
We probably
won't like that answer.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.104
The important thing
is that you're okay.

35:08.323 --> 35:09.324
Ready, pumpkin?

35:14.373 --> 35:16.897
You know, I think I might
meet you at home, actually,

35:16.940 --> 35:17.985
if that's okay.

35:23.033 --> 35:24.296
Thank you for coming down here.

35:30.519 --> 35:33.609
I think Jacob and I
are gonna go see if
there's any sno-cones left.

35:33.653 --> 35:36.351
He's making me
a sunrise surprise.

35:36.395 --> 35:39.833
It's mango, cherry,
coconut and chocolate.

35:39.876 --> 35:40.921
That's the surprise.

35:41.922 --> 35:42.879
See you guys later.

35:44.316 --> 35:47.188
And thanks for, you know,

35:48.102 --> 35:49.277
saving all our lives.

35:54.630 --> 35:56.937
<i>All right, POHS juniors,</i>

35:56.980 --> 35:58.939
<i>grab that special someone</i>

35:58.982 --> 36:00.810
<i>and head to</i> <i>
the Winter Wonderland</i> <i>
dance floor.</i>

36:00.854 --> 36:03.161
<i>It's time for the last dance</i> <i>
of the night.</i>

36:09.167 --> 36:10.864
It's our song.

36:10.907 --> 36:12.648
Should we head back inside?

36:12.692 --> 36:14.476
I don't want to
share this moment
with anyone else.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.086
Let's dance right here.

36:16.130 --> 36:18.654
<i>♪ Can you be my friend?</i>

36:18.698 --> 36:22.702
<i>♪ Can you be my lover</i> <i>
Up until the very end? ♪</i>

36:22.745 --> 36:24.486
So the bright one is Mars.

36:24.530 --> 36:27.750
And later, we can look for
the Milky Way.

36:27.794 --> 36:31.928
So, is everything up there
named for a candy bar, or what?

36:31.972 --> 36:33.800
Don't you want to learn about
the vastness of space?

36:33.843 --> 36:36.672
Oh, yeah, that's definitely why
I asked you on this date.

36:39.022 --> 36:40.763
Hey, do you think
we could spot some aliens?

36:40.807 --> 36:42.809
The telescope only spots things
that are actually real.

36:44.854 --> 36:47.248
<i>♪ I need somebody</i> <i>
Who can love me at my worst ♪</i>

36:47.292 --> 36:49.946
- Damn, I love this--
- This song is my jam.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.603
What'd I tell you? Fate.

36:54.647 --> 36:57.519
Shared taste in excellent music
is a coincidence,

36:57.563 --> 36:58.433
it's not fate.

37:00.130 --> 37:01.654
You really don't believe
in destiny?

37:02.437 --> 37:03.308
You do?

37:04.483 --> 37:05.353
Hell yeah!

37:06.702 --> 37:08.487
Hey, think of
the millions of things

37:08.530 --> 37:11.316
that had to go right
for this date to even happen.

37:11.359 --> 37:13.187
You mean me giving you
a second chance?

37:15.015 --> 37:16.059
I'm serious.

37:17.757 --> 37:20.629
You had to be born,
I had to be born.

37:20.673 --> 37:22.979
Your dad had to get transferred
to Port Oswego,

37:23.023 --> 37:24.111
same for my mom.

37:25.721 --> 37:28.507
And then I had to insult
your favorite superhero.

37:31.988 --> 37:33.207
A million decisions,

37:34.382 --> 37:36.297
just so we could be right here,

37:36.341 --> 37:37.255
right now.

37:41.346 --> 37:42.825
Fate is never an accident.

37:42.869 --> 37:47.395
<i>♪ I'll be there</i> <i>

37:47.439 --> 37:52.574
<i>♪ I need somebody</i> <i>

37:52.618 --> 37:56.404
<i>♪ Let me show you love, oh,</i> <i>
I don't pretend, yeah ♪</i>

37:56.448 --> 37:57.710
That super-speed thing,

37:59.189 --> 38:00.452
did you know you could do that?

38:02.105 --> 38:03.368
You know, I could

38:03.411 --> 38:05.108
feel myself
getting stronger, but,

38:05.935 --> 38:07.023
no, I had no idea.

38:08.373 --> 38:09.896
That happens a lot, actually.
I just

38:09.939 --> 38:11.463
discover all these new powers.

38:14.204 --> 38:16.642
I can't believe
my girlfriend has powers.

38:17.991 --> 38:19.079
That's pretty dope.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.474
You're taking this really well.

38:22.517 --> 38:24.302
I'm full of surprises, I guess.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.044
I'm actually surprising myself.

38:29.524 --> 38:31.613
Tonight was the most scared
I've ever been.

38:33.659 --> 38:35.356
I almost lost you.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.401
But you didn't.

38:37.402 --> 38:38.751
I'm right here.

38:38.794 --> 38:39.752
This time.

38:41.449 --> 38:43.277
This is real.

38:43.321 --> 38:46.280
There's real danger involved.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.674
And I hate the thought
of putting you,

38:49.936 --> 38:51.894
or anyone I care about
in danger.

38:54.810 --> 38:56.725
I can't live with me
putting you in harm.

38:56.769 --> 38:57.726
I just can't.

38:59.728 --> 39:01.295
Yeah, I know what it's like

39:01.339 --> 39:03.471
not to be able to
protect someone you care about.

39:05.517 --> 39:06.692
I learned that tonight.

39:10.783 --> 39:11.697
I hear you.

39:14.264 --> 39:16.745
But if it was hard not to be
able to protect someone,

39:18.617 --> 39:21.402
imagine being the one
putting people in harm's way.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.276
You being hurt because
of something that I did,

39:26.320 --> 39:29.454
I just... I... I can't do that.

39:35.198 --> 39:36.591
Tonight is just the beginning.

39:39.333 --> 39:42.554
You know,
I've been denying my destiny
for a really long time.

39:44.207 --> 39:47.080
Maybe I wasn't ready.

39:47.123 --> 39:49.952
Or maybe I just didn't want to
let go of everything as it was.

39:52.651 --> 39:53.695
And everyone.

39:56.872 --> 39:58.134
You don't have to let go.

40:03.923 --> 40:06.404
I know wherever
your destiny is leading you,

40:07.317 --> 40:08.493
I can't go with you.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.626
And I can't protect you.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.325
But it doesn't mean
I'll let go.

40:20.679 --> 40:21.984
We can't be together.

40:25.597 --> 40:27.512
But I'll always be
on your side.

40:29.644 --> 40:31.037
I'll always be with you.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.653
This isn't what I wanted.

40:43.223 --> 40:44.703
It doesn't matter what we want.

40:46.922 --> 40:47.836
It's fate.

40:49.359 --> 40:51.405
And it's never an accident.

40:53.799 --> 40:56.279
You've always had
a greater destiny, Naomi.

40:58.281 --> 41:00.022
Whether you believed in it
or not.

41:01.850 --> 41:02.851
You're a hero.

41:05.201 --> 41:06.202
A hero?

41:08.291 --> 41:10.293
You're the first person
to ever call me that.

41:10.337 --> 41:12.600
I'd recommend
getting used to it.

41:15.951 --> 41:17.431
I thought you

41:17.475 --> 41:19.302
didn't believe in superheroes.

41:23.437 --> 41:24.394
I do now.
