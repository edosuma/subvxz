When I was going with your Aunt Vivian,
I had a lot of nervous energy. Ha, ha.

13:01.423 --> 13:05.083
I used to get up every morning
at dawn and run through the park.

13:05.363 --> 13:07.323
You used to jog?

13:08.563 --> 13:10.893
That was a shortcut to the diner
where she worked.

13:11.803 --> 13:15.293
The one sure way that I could tell
that I was in love was that...

13:15.473 --> 13:19.833
You know those stupid, sappy love
songs I used to make fun of, you know?

13:20.003 --> 13:21.833
Well, they started making sense.

13:22.013 --> 13:24.503
I mean, this one really did it for me.

- [SOBBING] All right, stop, Uncle Phil, stop.
- Oh.

13:54.573 --> 13:57.673
Don't be ridiculous, Susan. The whole
family would love to go on a 10-mile jog.

[SNIFFS]

13:59.413 --> 14:00.673
Hold on.

14:00.843 --> 14:03.683
I smell pepperoni on the premises.

14:06.453 --> 14:09.353
You're busted, big guy.

14:09.523 --> 14:11.583
I'll just go eat some celery.

14:14.063 --> 14:16.223
Will, I am so surprised at you.

14:16.393 --> 14:20.623
Standing around here watching your uncle
dig himself into an early grave.

14:20.803 --> 14:23.563
Yeah, you filthy stinking enabler.

14:24.903 --> 14:28.503
Hey, look, wait a minute,
I got other things on my mind right now.

14:28.673 --> 14:33.233
I ain't got no time for buns of brass
and brains of bricks.

14:34.813 --> 14:36.613
He needs help.
You wouldn't talk that way...

14:36.783 --> 14:39.213
...if you walked just one mile
in your uncle's shoes.

14:39.383 --> 14:42.223
My uncle can't walk one mile
in my uncle's shoes.

14:43.623 --> 14:47.653
Listen, why don't you go haunt
one of your big-boned friends?

14:48.533 --> 14:50.893
Big-boned?

14:51.063 --> 14:55.163
Okay, I'm gonna show you big-boned.

15:04.213 --> 15:06.543
Looks like Lorena Bobbitt
got to this suit, huh?

[POWTER CHUCKLES]

part of your family education kit...

15:10.783 --> 15:11.913
...because you know why?

15:12.083 --> 15:15.713
In every group,
there's always an insensitive boob.

15:16.153 --> 15:18.483
We must be lucky, we got two. Ha, ha.

15:19.993 --> 15:23.553
This dumb suit ain't gonna prove nothing.
I could wear this thing for a week.

15:23.733 --> 15:25.823
Oh, really?
Why don't you just go out for one day?

15:26.003 --> 15:28.663
Go out in public and see what it feels like
to look like this. Go ahead.

- You were just singing "Lady" to a melon.

15:52.163 --> 15:54.893
Oh, that's how I check them for ripeness.

You think that's funny, huh? Whoo.

You ain't had no home training,

Excuse me, is there some reason
why you're following us?

you and thinking about you all the time.

Huh? Do you?

18:10.863 --> 18:15.093
Will, for the umpteenth time,
I told you, Dana and I are just friends.

18:15.263 --> 18:18.863
Oh, oh. Well, let me tell you
about your slimy little friend.

18:19.043 --> 18:23.173
He's just trying to gain your confidence,
so he'll know when you're most vulnerable.

18:23.343 --> 18:27.143
And that's when he's gonna pounce
on you like a cheetah on a rabbit.

18:27.583 --> 18:29.143

with me...

18:54.903 --> 18:56.633
...you are gonna have to trust me.

18:56.813 --> 18:59.503
The same way that I trust you
not to date anybody else.

18:59.683 --> 19:01.803
Oh, yeah, well, I did date somebody else.

19:01.983 --> 19:03.953

- Yes, I did, last night.

anything I wanted to do.

Because I love you.

I wanted to do an exercise tape.

19:45.253 --> 19:47.553
That would bring me, what, 10 million?

19:47.723 --> 19:51.063
Though, I wouldn't actually
have to touch fat people, would I?

19:51.233 --> 19:55.133
Could they just be
electronically morphed in later?

19:56.233 --> 19:58.333

to hang around...

- Hey, Master William.

No, "love. "
