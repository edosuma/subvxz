NARRATOR: In the future,
a computer program called Skynet...

00:05.923 --> 00:08.216
...will declare war on the human race.

00:09.593 --> 00:12.679
Machines have traveled back in time
taking human form...

00:12.846 --> 00:17.308
...to terminate John Connor,
the future leader of the Resistance.

teacher and protector.

Agent Ellison.

His name was Martin Bedell.

02:02.664 --> 02:05.666
He was in Century Work Camp
with you...

02:05.834 --> 02:07.251
...right up until the escape.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.712
-So I knew him.
-You knew him.

02:09.880 --> 02:10.963
Everybody knew him.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.758
But he doesn't know this one.
Not this Martin Bedell.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.968
No. Another Martin Bedell.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.512
Maybe it's just coincidence.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.515
How many coincidences
named Sarah Connor got killed...

02:20.682 --> 02:23.810
...before Skynet finally locked in
on you?

02:25.229 --> 02:28.272
-So why would they want to kill him?
-He had experience...

02:28.440 --> 02:29.941
...and knowledge John needed.

02:30.108 --> 02:33.611
Military prep school, then West Point.
Bedell had real training.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.989
He helped John
put the Resistance together.

02:48.377 --> 02:52.672
Okay. There were three Martin Bedells
in L.A., now there are two.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.509
-How do we know which is the target?
-They both are.

02:56.885 --> 03:00.888
Machines are thorough.
Only good thing about them.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.642
So it took you, what, 30 seconds
to find those names?

03:04.810 --> 03:07.436
If there is a Triple-8 out there,
he's found them too.

03:08.397 --> 03:11.482
SARAH: Where are you going?
-Martin Bedell Number 1.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.276
Closest address.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.319
-Without a plan?
-Yeah, I've got a plan.

03:15.487 --> 03:16.612
It involves guns.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.198
-Wait.
-You're not going with him.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.243
No, everybody wait.

03:24.580 --> 03:28.624
P Alto. We thought it was a person.
It's not. It's a place.

03:28.792 --> 03:33.087
It's a military prep school in Carlsbad.
Here's the directory.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.258

We will, will we?

03:43.765 --> 03:44.891
It's a boys' school.

03:45.350 --> 03:48.394

the other Martin Bedell.

04:14.463 --> 04:17.840

before he gets to you.

About Bedell. After we grab him,
where are we supposed to hide him?

05:34.334 --> 05:37.086
Who said we're gonna hide him?

05:37.462 --> 05:39.880

Martin Bedell dead somewhere.

-It is.

-When it's safe.

17:09.112 --> 17:10.737
-When's that?
-Soon.

17:10.905 --> 17:13.782
WOMAN [ON TV]:
Soft, smooth, clear, beautiful skin.

17:20.456 --> 17:23.208
-Do you do this every night?
-Yeah.

17:23.418 --> 17:25.627
Well, what happens
when you go to sleep?

17:26.295 --> 17:28.296
She happens.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.090
[COCKS GUN]

17:37.807 --> 17:39.808
Let's find you
something to wear for bed.

17:44.814 --> 17:47.441
Something in here should fit you.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.153
Try these.

17:52.488 --> 17:53.572
This is too small.

17:53.990 --> 17:57.325
-How do you know? Just try them.
-They're for a 5-year-old.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.496
How about this?

18:01.789 --> 18:04.249
That's for playing soccer.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.672
This isn't your stuff, is it?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.759
No, it's not our stuff.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.011
I wanna call my mom.

18:16.345 --> 18:20.307
She was supposed to get me a book
for my book report.

18:22.351 --> 18:25.187
If you call your mother,
that man will use her to find you.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.939
Then he'll kill her. He'll kill you.

18:29.317 --> 18:31.735
Ahem. Cameron.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.532
Would you like a bedtime story?

18:46.459 --> 18:48.210
CAMERON:
We made a tactical error.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.629
We should've engaged the Triple-8.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.215
With a little boy in the crossfire?

18:53.382 --> 18:55.133
The boy is not important.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.969
-He's not our mission.
-He is now.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.646
MARTIN:
It's just a meet and greet, sir.

19:07.814 --> 19:11.817
Say hi, ask them how they're holding up,
then "Company, dismissed." It's easy.

19:11.984 --> 19:15.487
Oh, and they're probably gonna wanna
ask you about OCC prep weekend.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.823
We take the juniors
through field exercises...

19:17.990 --> 19:21.535
...obstacle courses, simulated missions,
running around in the woods.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.411
It'll be fun.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.497
Fun.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.251
Hi.

19:29.919 --> 19:33.004
I'm Lieutenant Baum.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.757
I'm your new TAC.

19:35.925 --> 19:42.514
So I've been told that my job is to
make sure that you're all doing okay.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.103
Well, you all look okay to me.

19:48.604 --> 19:52.566
So any questions?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.112
All right then.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.114
PYLE:
Sir.

19:59.782 --> 20:01.783
We heard you were in the war.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.577
Heard you've seen action.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.038
Yeah.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.835
Yeah, I've seen action in the war.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.795
Got a lot of kills?

20:15.214 --> 20:18.550
-Say again?
-Kills, sir.

20:19.051 --> 20:22.637
I wanna go infantry soon as I get out
of here. Maybe Rangers, maybe Delta.

20:22.847 --> 20:27.100
Best of the best.

20:27.894 --> 20:31.646
Counting kills, like it's a game.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.356
Like it's just a game.

20:33.941 --> 20:38.778
I remember one particularly fun day.

20:40.489 --> 20:45.076
Guy in my squad got his stomach
blasted open in a firefight.

20:46.954 --> 20:50.332
He spent six hours
holding his own guts in.

20:51.375 --> 20:57.672
His buddy carried him on his back
to the nearest aid station.

20:57.882 --> 21:03.094
Just praying that someone could put
the dumb son of a bitch together again.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.265
The game, Pyle...

21:09.185 --> 21:11.895
...the game is played
with your buddy's life.

21:12.104 --> 21:16.483
With the life of your squad.
Your platoon.

21:16.651 --> 21:19.319
The game is played by you...

MARTIN:
Meet my friend the EFP.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.645
He sits in the middle of the road
and blows up metal.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.940
This is his life's ambition.
I intend to help him achieve it.

21:57.108 --> 21:59.192
We've seeded the street
with these things.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.236
We gotta make sure
that Ogre cooperates.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.989
MARTIN: Corporal Reese will take you
and set up.

22:04.156 --> 22:08.118
When the convoy rolls to your position,
open fire on this bunker.

22:08.285 --> 22:11.746
Ogre will think it's metal on skin
and move to assist. When it does:

22:11.914 --> 22:12.998
Boom.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.916

22:15.835 --> 22:17.043
Move out.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.256
Hey. They're kids.
They key off of you.

22:23.300 --> 22:24.926
I know.

22:50.828 --> 22:53.496
Your uncle, he's an intense guy.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.709
Yeah, I know.
He's a good guy, though.

22:58.794 --> 23:01.171
He's just--
He's a lot to take sometimes.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.508
All he's been through, well....

23:06.218 --> 23:08.219
What are you supposed to say to that?

23:08.387 --> 23:10.555
You mean, how do you measure up?

23:12.641 --> 23:15.143
Every man in my family
going back five generations...

23:15.311 --> 23:19.189
...has been a general, or statesman,
CEO, something amazing.

They all went here.

23:21.192 --> 23:25.278
But you know what the best part
about Presidio Alto is?

23:25.446 --> 23:26.946
The cross-country course.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.159
Man, sometimes when I'm out there...

23:31.327 --> 23:36.790
...I'm all alone, I'm going flat out,
everything just sort of...

23:36.957 --> 23:38.333
...falls away.

23:39.126 --> 23:41.419
But sometimes I wish it....

23:42.171 --> 23:43.755
I--

23:44.423 --> 23:48.510
That you could just keep on running
and never look back.

23:54.183 --> 23:56.893
I met this girl over the summer.

23:57.061 --> 23:59.145
Her name's Alicia.

23:59.355 --> 24:01.314
She's amazing, dude.

24:01.482 --> 24:04.359
She started at Dartmouth this year.
She's a runner like me.

24:04.527 --> 24:08.238
She's coming home in a couple weeks,
and when she goes back...

24:08.864 --> 24:12.784
...I think I wanna go with her.
And never look back.

24:18.499 --> 24:19.874
That's a secret, Baum.

24:20.876 --> 24:23.044
You treat it as such.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.759
I always do.

24:54.243 --> 24:55.493
I was just on the roof.

24:57.413 --> 25:00.790
It's flat terrain all around,
but the woods are a problem.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.127
When it comes,
that's where it'll come from.

25:04.295 --> 25:06.462
You're alone and exposed here.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.548
It's not good.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.926
And you're gonna tell me,
"I know better."

-He won't.
-Well, he is.

He doesn't. He graduates.

25:28.277 --> 25:30.028
Why?

25:31.322 --> 25:36.159
Because the future already happened,
and he's just going through the motions?

25:36.327 --> 25:39.787
-He doesn't have a choice.
-Oh, he's got a choice.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.373
We just gotta help him
make the right one.

There are three exits within 20 meters,
two lead to a parking lot.

unlocked, with the keys above the visor.

I told you.

27:01.036 --> 27:04.038

-Book report.

27:04.206 --> 27:06.291
Yeah, it's due by Monday...

27:06.458 --> 27:10.044
...and I haven't even picked out
a book yet. Don't you listen?

27:15.551 --> 27:16.592
Let's find you one.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.806
There's gotta be
something for you somewhere.

It was John's favorite.

27:40.576 --> 27:41.951
Who's John?

27:48.125 --> 27:49.792
The machine won't stop.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.961
It'll go back to that kid's house...

27:52.129 --> 27:54.672
-...find his parents, find his mom.
-I would.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.424
The police will be there by now.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.885
-The police won't matter.
-I know.

27:59.428 --> 28:02.347
You don't need to be here.
There are other places to be.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.557
You want me to protect his parents.

28:04.725 --> 28:06.601
I want you to keep this contained.

-Job requirement.

28:23.035 --> 28:26.079
Right. Private sector.

28:31.126 --> 28:34.504
Yeah. When Carl Greenway went nuts.

-I understand he used to come in here.
-They all do.

28:37.508 --> 28:39.926
Including Carl.

Used to sit right where you're sitting,

28:49.061 --> 28:50.728
Was he alone like me?

28:50.896 --> 28:52.522
Pretty much every night.

28:52.689 --> 28:55.108
I don't know why the guy
came in here at all.

28:55.275 --> 28:57.860
Still, I do remember some hottie
chatting him up...

28:58.028 --> 29:00.988
...the night before everything went down
at the power plant.

29:01.532 --> 29:04.534

Tungsten core, armor piercing,

Hits with the force
of a 20 mm cannon.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.446
I saw your dad take down
an H-K with one.

30:23.614 --> 30:26.657
He liked it better than his plasma rifle.

30:27.576 --> 30:28.784
So this is gonna kill it.

30:29.369 --> 30:34.749

DEREK:
Yeah.

to get the blood out of his fatigues.

You know, it's funny...

31:12.287 --> 31:16.499
...I saw a deer the other day,
made me think of him.

31:19.002 --> 31:20.962
We were together
the last time I saw one.

31:21.129 --> 31:23.005
-Before Judgement Day?
-No, after.

31:23.173 --> 31:26.842
We were up in Griffith Park
hunting for food.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.554
It was a big bastard too.

31:31.515 --> 31:35.184
Your dad had never seen one before.
I mean, not like that.

31:36.937 --> 31:39.814
After I killed it, and we got close...

31:42.734 --> 31:44.527
...your dad started crying.

31:45.654 --> 31:49.907
But more than I'd ever heard
or seen him.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.705
I didn't know how to make him stop.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.915
I buried the deer.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.042
We went hungry.

32:05.173 --> 32:07.383
He was just a boy.

32:08.176 --> 32:11.679
-So were you.
-Yeah.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.348
I guess I was.

32:22.024 --> 32:24.734
ELLISON:
You see how the metal is twisted?

32:24.901 --> 32:28.654
You can have the Steelers' entire
offensive line tugging on that valve...

32:28.864 --> 32:31.532
...and not generate enough force
to do that.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.285
So you agree it was a machine
as I thought?

32:34.494 --> 32:35.661
Two machines.

32:36.413 --> 32:41.125
One machine ripped the valve open,
and I'm guessing the other closed it.

32:41.627 --> 32:44.086
And I'm pretty sure
there was a fight between them.

32:45.714 --> 32:48.424
Two machines.

32:48.592 --> 32:50.760
This is new.

32:52.471 --> 32:53.888

32:54.056 --> 32:56.307
Why did they fight?

That will complicate
our respective goals, won't it, James?

33:17.913 --> 33:20.456
What would those respective goals be?

into the next century.

33:26.254 --> 33:30.966

you're an avenging angel.

So let's keep looking.
