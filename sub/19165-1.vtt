<I>Famous American author
Richard Bach once said...

01:42.520 --> 01:44.788
<I>"Real love stories never have endings."

01:44.888 --> 01:48.458
<i>But famous American author Richard Bach
has also been married three times.</i>

02:10.513 --> 02:13.851
<i>I guess if what famous American
author Richard Bach has to say is true...</i>

02:13.951 --> 02:17.087
<i>...then it's important to know
where love stories begin...</i>

02:17.187 --> 02:20.056
<i>...and mine began right here.</i>

02:21.992 --> 02:23.794
<i>Real love is hard to find...</i>

02:23.894 --> 02:26.893
<i>...it's something most people believe
only exists in romance novels...</i>

02:26.993 --> 02:30.234
<i>...but history is filled
with stories of real love...</i>

02:30.334 --> 02:33.736
<i>...and the men who do crazy things for it.</i>

02:35.839 --> 02:38.910
<i>My story, well,
my story's not much different.</i>

02:39.010 --> 02:40.845
You got it.

02:41.345 --> 02:44.882
<i>Look, most people say they
don't believe in love at first sight...</i>

02:44.982 --> 02:46.584
<i>...but I do...</i>

02:46.684 --> 02:50.387
<i>...and she... she was my proof.</i>

03:01.165 --> 03:05.786
<i>Her name is Alex and I knew I loved her
from the moment I first laid eyes on her.</i>

03:15.178 --> 03:18.651
<i>Unfortunately for me
she had no idea I even existed.</i>

03:20.650 --> 03:24.086
Excuse me, can I... can I just fit in, yeah!

03:25.922 --> 03:29.038
- What can I get you?
- I'll have a diet coke.

03:32.228 --> 03:34.063
I love you.

03:35.098 --> 03:36.901
I love you, too!

03:37.701 --> 03:41.272
I said, "that's two?" Two!

03:41.372 --> 03:43.737
Right, that's just... yeah.

03:45.324 --> 03:48.745
Yeah, 'cause... that would...

03:50.080 --> 03:52.183
<i>Not my finest moment.</i>

03:52.283 --> 03:55.352
I paid for both the cars.
I'm entitled to both of them.

03:55.452 --> 03:58.688
I gave you the apartment,
that's several thousand right there.

04:01.691 --> 04:05.223
I want the ring back. My grandmother's
money paid for that ring.

04:06.063 --> 04:09.647
I don't give a shit what your lawyer says!

04:09.747 --> 04:14.412
Look, I've got the papers right here,
I can just meet you right now...

04:14.512 --> 04:18.399
...and we can sign these
and get this over with, please!

04:20.576 --> 04:22.046
Hello?

04:22.346 --> 04:26.382
You stupid... oh, my God!

04:37.360 --> 04:38.629
Are you lost?

04:38.729 --> 04:41.565
Yeah, I can't seem to find my car anywhere.

04:41.665 --> 04:45.736
This is employee parking.
Guest parking is two floors up.

04:45.836 --> 04:47.703
That must be it.

04:48.805 --> 04:50.875
Haven't I seen you before?

04:51.375 --> 04:54.278
Yeah, yeah, you have. I'm Clarence.

04:54.378 --> 04:57.781
Shit, sorry, I gotta go. Hello?

04:57.881 --> 05:00.801
<i>All right, no need to go on,
you get the picture.</i>

05:00.901 --> 05:03.525
<i>Pretty girl marries asshole,
ignores the nice guy at her bar...</i>

05:03.725 --> 05:07.641
<i>...who's madly in love with her
and would probably go down on her like...</i>

05:07.741 --> 05:11.145
<i>...anytime she wanted,
all the days of her life.</i>

05:11.545 --> 05:13.613
<i>Okay, it's a bad joke.</i>

05:14.647 --> 05:17.623
<i>You see, after this, I decided
to observe the situation...</i>

05:17.723 --> 05:20.019
<i>...and see if I could find a way in.</i>

05:20.954 --> 05:22.857
<i>Like when she got her first tattoo...</i>

05:22.957 --> 05:27.495
<i>...when our grandmother's passed away
in the same month hence the tattoo...</i>

05:27.595 --> 05:29.862
<i>...rest in peace, nan nan and mi maw.</i>

05:32.131 --> 05:35.575
<i>And when she decided to divorce
said asshole, who by the way...</i>

05:35.675 --> 05:40.173
<i>...used her grandmother's money that she
left her to buy her a new wedding ring.</i>

05:41.474 --> 05:43.309
<i>Classy guy.</i>

05:44.612 --> 05:47.647
<i>This is around the time
I decided to get proactive.</i>

05:49.682 --> 05:52.307
<i>I knew that if just given the chance
to sweep her off her feet...</i>

05:52.407 --> 05:55.089
<i>...she'd realize that I'm the guy for her.</i>

05:55.189 --> 05:59.293
<i>I just needed to get her attention
in a really big way.</i>

05:59.393 --> 06:01.959
<i>There was only one person
I knew that could help me do that...</i>

06:02.059 --> 06:04.346
<i>...and that was Patrick.</i>

06:29.823 --> 06:32.059
<i>I'd seen Patrick before at Alex's bar.</i>

06:32.159 --> 06:35.096
<i>He started frequenting this place
about six months ago.</i>

06:35.196 --> 06:37.613
<i>His reputation needed no backing up.</i>

06:43.103 --> 06:47.808
<i>Patrick was a smooth talking, bullshit's
walking, girl-getting son of a bitch.</i>

06:47.908 --> 06:50.310
<i>At least, that's how he described himself.</i>

06:57.585 --> 06:59.014
What can I get you, stud?

06:59.114 --> 07:04.160
Tequila and would you put it on her tab?

07:04.841 --> 07:06.709
He's got you covered.

07:08.561 --> 07:12.573
Thank you very much! Very nice of you,
but I don't swing that way, buddy.

07:14.001 --> 07:17.469
Actually, he's covering
the entire bar tonight.

07:18.638 --> 07:20.706
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:21.341 --> 07:22.625
Cheers!

07:24.711 --> 07:27.580
Can I get like two more of these?

07:31.717 --> 07:33.585
Up top.

07:49.452 --> 07:51.389
Told you you're my good luck charm.

07:51.539 --> 07:55.109
Why don't you get a drink,
on me, whatever you like, okay?

07:55.209 --> 07:56.776
Okay.

08:04.784 --> 08:08.989
Hey, drinks guy. Cheers, thank you.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.956
Don't mention it.

08:11.691 --> 08:13.525
Wanna play?

08:14.060 --> 08:15.862
What's the game?

08:16.563 --> 08:18.655
How about 100 bucks a ball?

08:20.466 --> 08:23.769
- Too rich for my blood.
- You can play with my money.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.014
That's not really how gambling works,
you understand?

08:34.114 --> 08:35.982
Yeah, well...

08:36.283 --> 08:39.219
...just trying to keep things interesting.

09:17.323 --> 09:19.559
Corner... shot.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.167
Man of your word.

09:26.567 --> 09:30.571
If my math's correct, I've given you $1500
to knock in every ball on that table.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.513
Not to mention all the free drinks
you could want.

09:32.613 --> 09:35.008
Now, I'm wondering
if there's a favor I could ask of you?

09:35.108 --> 09:38.552
Sure, I mean, ask whatever you want
just as long as it's not to give it back.

09:38.652 --> 09:41.110
No, it's quite the opposite.

09:42.015 --> 09:45.719
I have an investment opportunity
I'd like to talk to you about.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.656
I'm sorry, all my money's
tied up at the moment.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.572
Not your money.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.526
I'd be investing in you.

09:54.961 --> 09:56.831
A proposition.

09:57.231 --> 10:01.650
I knew it, you're trying to fuck me, man.
I knew it, man, every time! Every time!

10:01.750 --> 10:04.506
It's... look, I will give you $500...

10:04.606 --> 10:07.474
...an extra $500 if you listen
to me for just a few minutes.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.610
If you don't like what you hear,
feel free to walk away.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.685
You can keep all the money,
it's yours, I gave it to you.

10:11.785 --> 10:15.615
But if you like what you hear, there's
a whole lot more where that came from.

10:18.418 --> 10:23.090
Are you messing with me?
I mean, is this like one of those shows?

10:23.190 --> 10:27.294
Are there cameras here? Am I gonna look
like an asshole when I say no, is that it?

10:27.394 --> 10:30.196
There are no cameras. Just us.

10:36.902 --> 10:38.554
You smoke?

10:43.776 --> 10:46.179
Okay, Daddy Warbucks, shoot.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.215
Well, there's this girl.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.819
- You want me to help get you laid?
- No... not exactly.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.921
- Then she's special?
- Very.

10:54.021 --> 10:57.825
- Why don't you ask her out?
- See, that's the thing...

10:57.925 --> 11:03.042
- I mean, you got money, girls like money.
- No, not this girl, she's different.

11:03.142 --> 11:07.600
Girls aren't different,
girls are not different.

11:09.368 --> 11:12.834
- I'm Clarence. Clarence.
- Clarence.

11:13.740 --> 11:16.210
Women are not different,
they're all the same.

11:16.610 --> 11:19.146
No, no, this girl's different.
I'm telling you she's different.

11:19.246 --> 11:22.049
I get it, you're in love,
you can't tell a kid in love anything.

11:22.149 --> 11:25.951
So, can I just show you this girl
and you can decide from there?

11:27.319 --> 11:29.655
I'll give you another $500.

11:33.459 --> 11:35.260
All right, give me the money.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.567
It's this way.

11:46.073 --> 11:49.909
- Is that your car?
- Yeah. Why?

11:54.114 --> 11:56.056
What did you say your last name was?

11:56.316 --> 11:57.818
Duffield.

11:58.318 --> 12:01.186
Duffield as in, the Duffields?

12:03.856 --> 12:07.094
You know, guys with your kind of money
don't usually have a problem getting laid.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.696
Yeah, well, call me a hopeless romantic.

12:09.796 --> 12:13.800
- So your girl isn't into money.
- What makes you say that?

12:13.900 --> 12:18.168
Always be the smartest guy in the room.
Women who are interested in money...

12:18.268 --> 12:22.509
...they decide within the first 20 seconds
of meeting you whether they wanna screw.

12:22.609 --> 12:26.113
If your girl's not interested in you, well,
she's probably not interested in that.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.181
But how would she know
if I have money or not?

12:28.281 --> 12:31.269
You grow up with one of those kids
who came from such a wealthy family...

12:31.369 --> 12:35.055
...that they were just socially awkward all
the time, like they didn't know how to act?

12:35.155 --> 12:37.691
- No.
- That's cause that kid's you.

12:37.791 --> 12:40.561
Yeah, all right, but, see, she has never
gotten the chance to know me.

12:40.661 --> 12:44.081
You don't get the chance, man.
You have to create the opportunity.

12:44.181 --> 12:49.034
Right, see, now that's where you come in.
See, this girl, she's tough, she's...

12:49.134 --> 12:51.372
...like independent and strong.

12:51.472 --> 12:53.940
It's gonna take something grand
to get her in the right situation.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.009
Something grand, huh?

12:56.109 --> 12:58.679
Well, how many grand are you willing
to spend for something grand?

12:58.779 --> 13:03.015
I don't know, we'll get to that.
First, you've gotta see this girl.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.499
There she is.

13:24.837 --> 13:26.639
That's the girl?

13:36.616 --> 13:39.418
- I'll consider it.
- What?

13:40.052 --> 13:43.057
- We'll talk.
- Really?

13:43.757 --> 13:46.758
Tomorrow... 10 o'clock.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.448
- Can I get a diet coke, please.
- Sure.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.956
- Thanks.
- Hey, Martini, dry, two olives.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.564
Sure.

14:24.497 --> 14:27.199
Hey, how are you doin'?

14:28.300 --> 14:31.404
- Fine, thanks.
- That's great, that's good.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.307
That's real good.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.177
Listen... what are you drinking over there?

14:37.277 --> 14:39.111
No, thanks.

14:42.348 --> 14:45.118
Listen, doll, I'm just trying
to buy you a drink over here.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.454
Yeah, I'm good to go. But, thank you.

14:48.955 --> 14:51.872
You sure are, you are certainly good to go.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.629
- That's why I'm here.
- Excuse me?

14:55.729 --> 14:57.898
Listen, I'm gonna ask you a serious question.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.067
Why are you coming to a bar all by yourself?

15:00.167 --> 15:02.636
You know you just wanted
some young stud to come in...

15:02.736 --> 15:05.370
Hey, she said she's not interested, okay?

15:10.475 --> 15:13.712
- That's mine.
- Is that so?

15:15.047 --> 15:17.951
<i>Famous American philosopher
Ralph Waldo Emerson once said...</i>

15:18.051 --> 15:20.490
<i>"...a hero is no braver
than an ordinary man...</i>

15:20.590 --> 15:22.888
<i>...but he is braver five minutes longer."</i>

15:26.225 --> 15:29.797
Oh, my God! I am so sorry, sir.

15:29.897 --> 15:33.166
I am so sorry, ma'am! I'm a piece of shit.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.362
You're a good dude, you are a good dude.

15:35.462 --> 15:38.470
I'm sorry, I'm out, I'm out!

15:40.239 --> 15:42.040
Thank you.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.569
Do you mind if I buy you another drink?

15:50.549 --> 15:52.252
No, that's not necessary.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.621
Right, sorry,
I'm sure you're probably married.

15:58.357 --> 16:00.159
Excuse me for just a...

16:06.899 --> 16:10.569
- Well done.
- Did you see what just happened?

16:12.371 --> 16:15.108
- Looks like you got her attention.
- But I didn't do anything.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.711
That guy just grabbed my drink
and threw it in his face like a psycho.

16:17.811 --> 16:21.414
- She doesn't know that.
- Why would he do that?

16:21.514 --> 16:26.119
Because I paid him... $20 to hit on her.

16:26.219 --> 16:29.956
And then if you were so kind as to
intervene he was to make you her savior.

16:30.056 --> 16:32.326
What are you getting at?

16:32.726 --> 16:35.562
Always be the smartest guy
in the room, Clarence.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.965
Now, that was just a sample, a test to see...

16:39.065 --> 16:43.078
...if you had the balls...

16:44.536 --> 16:48.007
...to pull that off and when you did...

16:48.507 --> 16:50.550
...I took over from there.

16:50.650 --> 16:53.279
So that's your plan, to have
an asshole hit on her in a bar?

16:53.379 --> 16:54.881
Because that happens to her every night.

16:54.981 --> 16:58.438
No, I think in your case we're gonna
need something a little bit more...

17:00.790 --> 17:02.992
...how'd you say, grand?

17:05.892 --> 17:09.061
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- You don't like it?

17:09.162 --> 17:11.719
- No, of course, I don't fucking like it.
- Why not?

17:11.819 --> 17:14.468
- It's illegal, it's dangerous, it's...
- It's genius.

17:14.568 --> 17:17.570
- How, how is it genius?
- It's exactly what she wants, man.

17:17.671 --> 17:20.320
You're gonna sweep her off her feet.
You get to be the hero...

17:20.421 --> 17:25.512
...you have a little alone time to bond.
I'll be in control the whole time.

17:26.112 --> 17:28.315
It's insane, it's insane! It's...

17:28.415 --> 17:30.249
It's perfect.

17:34.119 --> 17:35.722
Okay, all right, what if something happens?

17:35.822 --> 17:38.425
What if we get caught, what if someone
gets hurts? It's too dangerous.

17:38.525 --> 17:41.461
It's not fucking dangerous,
it's controlled chaos, totally different.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.564
No, no, I'm not doing it, I'm not doing it!

17:44.964 --> 17:48.233
- Fine. Fine, go, leave.
- Fine!

17:49.451 --> 17:52.721
Three, two, one.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.787
All right, how do I even pull this off?

17:55.887 --> 17:59.312
Always be the smartest guy in the room.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.415
Okay, you keep saying that,
but what exactly does that mean?

18:02.515 --> 18:05.986
It means, don't put yourself
in situations that you cannot control.

18:06.086 --> 18:09.990
Know the people, know
the circumstances. Be the smartest guy.

18:10.090 --> 18:13.761
$25,000... next weekend.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.292
Take it or leave it.

18:43.289 --> 18:46.186
<i>The great American actress
Mae West once said...</i>

18:46.286 --> 18:50.828
<i>"Every man I meet wants to protect me,
but I can't figure out what from."</i>

19:13.053 --> 19:14.586
What?

19:32.704 --> 19:34.205
Shit!

19:38.543 --> 19:43.348
Hey, it's Alex, did I leave a red
folder somewhere in the back?

19:45.451 --> 19:49.922
No? Shit! I'm gonna have to come look for it.

19:50.022 --> 19:54.072
All right, yeah, no, it's cool,
I'll see you in a second. Thanks.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.921
I'm...

20:21.021 --> 20:24.191
- Holy shit, you scared the hell out of me!
- I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

20:24.291 --> 20:26.626
Yeah, I'm sure you didn't,
pulling out that fast.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.229
- Look, I'm...
- You should watch where you're going.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.196
I'm sorry.

20:33.432 --> 20:35.300
Yeah, you said that.

20:37.769 --> 20:41.840
Would you like to get dinner
with me sometime?

20:44.142 --> 20:46.211
Did you really just ask me out?

20:48.780 --> 20:51.115
Hey, what the hell?

20:54.618 --> 20:56.489
Take your hands off her!

21:05.997 --> 21:07.833
I'll take it from here.

21:15.406 --> 21:17.305
Help me!

21:22.014 --> 21:25.083
Help me! Somebody! I'm being attacked!

21:49.374 --> 21:51.176
Get down, get down!

21:57.349 --> 21:59.586
Hey, don't fucking judge us!

21:59.686 --> 22:02.487
You've never seen
an interracial couple before?

22:03.822 --> 22:04.891
Stop that!

22:04.991 --> 22:08.259
What, I thought you
fucking liked me, man! God!

22:09.528 --> 22:11.197
Here.

22:11.297 --> 22:13.533
- Hurry!
- Get in the van!

22:13.633 --> 22:15.802
- Hurry!
- Get the rope!

22:15.902 --> 22:19.021
- What? No! Rape!
- Don't you hurt her!

22:19.121 --> 22:21.641
- Give me the bag!
- How about you give me a minute!

22:21.741 --> 22:24.552
- This bitch broke my fucking hand!
- Give me the fucking bag!

22:24.652 --> 22:27.913
- Okay, here's your bag!
- Yo, yo, yo, move, motherfucker!

22:30.315 --> 22:32.116
I drive.

22:42.794 --> 22:43.830
What, man?

22:43.930 --> 22:46.900
Bro, how the fuck did you take a kick
to the balls like that?

22:47.000 --> 22:49.433
Don't you know, I'm all dick, baby!

22:50.669 --> 22:53.439
- Who are you people?
- Shut the fuck up and we won't hurt you.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.208
Dude, this is fucking bullshit, man.

22:55.308 --> 22:58.344
Like, I should totally have one
of those cool, voice-box thingies.

22:58.444 --> 23:01.214
Like, I would murder it with that shit.
You know that, right, bro?

23:01.314 --> 23:03.867
I'm trying to make up
for these ridiculous masks you got.

23:03.967 --> 23:06.386
Ridiculous masks? More like iconic masks!

23:06.486 --> 23:10.723
All the coolest criminals have iconic masks.
Patrick Swayze, Point Break.

23:10.823 --> 23:15.111
Ben Affleck, The Town.
Fucking even Bob DeNiro in the Heat.

23:15.211 --> 23:19.632
For real though, Nicki Minaj is
an icon as far as I'm concerned.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.601
She is an icon, blow that shit up, bro.

23:21.701 --> 23:26.039
You seen that music video? You seen
them hips? You seen them, y'all seen them?

23:26.139 --> 23:30.075
Put your fucking mask back on
and don't take it off until I say.

23:31.009 --> 23:32.844
Turn right.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.419
- Hold still!
- Where are you taking me?

23:39.519 --> 23:40.787
Your ATM, honey.

23:40.887 --> 23:44.490
I'm going through a divorce all my money
is frozen, I can't pay you right now!

23:44.590 --> 23:46.846
- Hold still!
- We don't want your money.

23:46.946 --> 23:50.130
- What the fuck do you want from me?
- Hold her!

23:50.230 --> 23:53.499
We're gonna find out just how valuable
you are to your friend here.

23:53.599 --> 23:57.447
- 5, can I get 5, got 10, 20, 25, 30!
- Where are the headphones?

23:57.837 --> 24:01.239
- Hey, just keep still, all right.
- We're all good back here.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.475
Speak for yourself.

24:04.676 --> 24:08.113
- Here we go.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

24:09.082 --> 24:12.748
- Seriously?
- Okay, now we're good.

24:23.846 --> 24:27.434
- Is he fucking retarded?
- Yo, that was my momma, dude!

24:27.534 --> 24:31.541
Motherfucker, turn off y'all phones.
Give them to me, all of them.

24:31.641 --> 24:35.608
- And make sure you grab theirs, too.
- I'll get hers, there you go.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.911
Where is it?

24:38.011 --> 24:41.281
- Get your hands off of her!
- Calm your tits!

24:41.381 --> 24:42.915
Your fucking girlfriend...

24:43.015 --> 24:44.751
No! Stop!

24:44.851 --> 24:46.786
- Pervert.
- Oh, no, no!

24:46.886 --> 24:48.419
Phone.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.658
Where's the turn?

24:54.793 --> 24:56.594
It's just up ahead.

25:13.277 --> 25:16.269
Hey, man. Could I get the code, please?
I'd really appreciate it.

25:16.549 --> 25:18.616
Oh, yeah, it's written on my hand.

25:19.785 --> 25:22.088
Why the fuck is it written on your hand?

25:22.188 --> 25:24.490
It's a new code, all right,
I couldn't fucking remember it.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.226
That's really smart, if you think about it.

25:26.326 --> 25:28.362
He probably like doesn't even
want us to know the real code...

25:28.462 --> 25:31.530
...so he's just like making up a fake code.
That's awesome, you know.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.878
- All right, motherfucker, let's do this.
- Yo, yo, yo! Cool it, ninja.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.480
- What?
- You got watch.

25:47.580 --> 25:50.816
- What are you talking about, what?
- You drive, you watch.

25:50.916 --> 25:52.738
That's the rules.

25:53.152 --> 25:57.155
Dude, go fuck yourself, man. You're not
the boss of me. He's not the boss of me.

26:00.859 --> 26:03.062
Come on, move, move!

26:04.830 --> 26:06.632
All right, where's mine?

26:09.901 --> 26:12.938
You're kidding, right? A rubber gun?

26:14.172 --> 26:15.108
No. What?

26:15.208 --> 26:17.744
If I had some bullets in this thing
I'd blow your fucking head off.

26:17.844 --> 26:19.915
That's nice, tough guy.

26:29.287 --> 26:31.323
You ready for this, cakes?

26:34.593 --> 26:36.819
You know, it'll all be over real soon.

26:39.197 --> 26:41.166
And then...

26:44.469 --> 26:46.005
...here.

26:50.208 --> 26:52.044
Happily ever after.

26:53.958 --> 26:56.848
- Promise?
- I promise.

27:10.762 --> 27:13.232
Don't you worry,
I'm gonna figure a way out of this.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.334
She can't hear you, bro.

27:17.302 --> 27:20.540
Just give me the gun.
If you kiss me, I'm gonna hit you, bro.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.274
Hey, hey!

27:24.843 --> 27:27.212
When I say so, all right?

27:32.083 --> 27:36.156
- Channel three.
- Yeah, yeah, totally, channel three.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.709
Hey, boss?

27:39.009 --> 27:42.304
Just a real quick question.
You didn't give me a gun.

27:45.764 --> 27:47.166
Why don't I get a gun?

27:47.266 --> 27:49.455
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

27:49.555 --> 27:52.604
Because you're fucking nuts
and I don't trust you.

27:56.808 --> 27:58.611
This is fucking bullshit.

28:10.438 --> 28:12.442
All right, good talk.

28:14.093 --> 28:15.855
Get in there, bitch!

28:20.449 --> 28:22.251
Oh, shit.

28:23.334 --> 28:25.771
- Shut it off!
- Shut it off!

28:25.871 --> 28:30.242
Shut it off! And you, you didn't think
there was gonna be a fucking alarm?

28:30.342 --> 28:32.845
Don't do anything until I tell you to.

28:32.945 --> 28:36.143
- Fucking nimrod!
- Get down!

28:36.243 --> 28:38.317
Get down, now!

28:38.417 --> 28:40.252
What's this?

28:40.656 --> 28:42.223
Stop!

28:44.457 --> 28:47.893
- Stay on the ground!
- Hey, is the house empty?

28:48.960 --> 28:51.431
- Not now, but yes, it was.
- Motherfucker, don't make me hurt you!

28:51.531 --> 28:55.334
Yes, the house is empty, I live alone.
Ask your fucking questions better!

28:56.268 --> 28:58.310
Get down, down!

29:02.807 --> 29:05.445
Everybody, quiet.

29:06.245 --> 29:09.572
Now, we know there's somebody
very important to you...

29:09.672 --> 29:12.318
...who is under that hood
right there, Clarence Duffield.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.654
How do you know who I am?

29:14.754 --> 29:17.740
I'll ask the questions
or I can shoot her in the head.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.125
No, no, okay, okay!

29:19.225 --> 29:22.028
Okay, so, what we need
is $50,000 in the next hour.

29:22.128 --> 29:25.231
- Do you think you could make that happen?
- 50? I thought we said...

29:25.331 --> 29:28.934
- Shit, can you not do that so hard?
- Motherfucker, what?

29:29.034 --> 29:30.982
Fuck, my ear!

29:32.537 --> 29:35.407
Will you take her away?

29:36.541 --> 29:39.570
Up! Get up now!

29:40.215 --> 29:41.770
Move.

29:44.315 --> 29:46.385
- What the fuck is this?
- Don't worry about him.

29:46.485 --> 29:48.921
- I'm the one paying you, you know?
- Bitch, I don't work for you.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.056
Will you do something about this, please?

29:51.756 --> 29:55.261
Would you please go upstairs
and just trash stuff?

29:55.361 --> 29:59.698
- Wait, why does he have to do that?
- You want it to seem authentic, don't you?

30:00.231 --> 30:03.329
- I guess, but...
- There's no buts.

30:03.429 --> 30:06.406
We either do this for real
or we don't do it at all.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.107
No, I...

30:14.647 --> 30:17.583
You got a Vicodan or Oxy, by any chance?

30:18.369 --> 30:20.885
I don't think so. Sorry.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.821
No worries.

30:47.162 --> 30:50.349
- What's with the voice?
- Anonymity thing.

30:50.449 --> 30:52.832
- Nice touch.
- Thank you.

30:54.785 --> 30:56.155
So where's the money?

30:56.255 --> 30:59.024
You'll get your money.
First I need time with her.

30:59.124 --> 31:00.259
Really?

31:00.359 --> 31:03.228
Yeah, that's the only way this is gonna work.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.166
Well, okay.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.368
Make it count.

31:13.337 --> 31:14.835
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

31:14.935 --> 31:16.113
Come on.

31:45.837 --> 31:48.207
- Help! Help!
- Hey, it's me, it's me, it's me!

31:48.307 --> 31:50.209
- Who are you?
- It's me, it's Clarence!

31:50.309 --> 31:54.680
You don't know me, I'm... hi, I'm Clarence.

31:54.780 --> 31:56.615
But I'm not one of them.

31:56.715 --> 31:58.284
See?

31:59.884 --> 32:01.753
What's going on?

32:02.353 --> 32:04.155
That's complicated.

32:06.224 --> 32:08.027
Where are we?

32:09.555 --> 32:11.310
We're at my house.

32:13.231 --> 32:15.120
You live here?

32:16.868 --> 32:18.503
Yeah.

32:19.637 --> 32:21.440
What do they want from us?

32:21.840 --> 32:23.409
It's not you they want.

32:23.509 --> 32:26.545
That is actually not true... it is true.

32:26.645 --> 32:30.515
It's more of what they want from me, for you.

32:31.416 --> 32:33.685
Doesn't really look that way.

32:36.721 --> 32:38.357
See...

32:38.657 --> 32:42.077
...they brought you here because I...

32:44.362 --> 32:46.399
...because I...

32:46.999 --> 32:49.568
- ...because I...
- Because why?

32:50.468 --> 32:52.438
- Because they knew I...
- We need to have a chat!

32:52.538 --> 32:55.540
- No, stop, stop, please!
- Wait! Stop, stop, no!

32:58.576 --> 33:02.548
- All right, what the hell are you doing?
- You always gotta leave them wanting more.

33:02.648 --> 33:03.683
What?

33:03.783 --> 33:05.517
You were about to re-enact
the notebook in there.

33:05.617 --> 33:07.273
No, I wasn't, and you don't
have to be so fucking rough.

33:07.373 --> 33:10.722
Do you want this to feel real for her or not?

33:10.822 --> 33:15.261
It's your money, man. It is your move.
I am just here to help you.

33:15.761 --> 33:17.748
- Okay.
- You gonna let me do my job?

33:17.848 --> 33:20.901
- Yeah, okay. Yes.
- Please? Thank you.

33:21.901 --> 33:26.105
Let's just take a beat
and just relax, all right?

33:26.205 --> 33:30.442
And we'll go back out there and we'll
get into it. This is a very nice room.

33:35.914 --> 33:37.917
Hey, what was he saying?

33:39.550 --> 33:41.153
You really wanna know?

33:46.791 --> 33:48.396
Well...

33:50.053 --> 33:51.856
...girl to girl...

33:52.479 --> 33:57.256
...we have on good authority that your
friend Clarence will pay big bucks...

33:57.357 --> 33:59.198
...for your safety.

33:59.972 --> 34:03.009
Why would he do that? I don't even know him.

34:03.609 --> 34:05.644
Because he's in love with you.

34:08.212 --> 34:11.041
Kind of romantic, if you ask me.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.264
<i>Hey, Post One to Post Two,
I'm heading out to do my rounds.</i>

34:25.364 --> 34:27.599
<i>Will you cover the south side gate for me?</i>

34:34.569 --> 34:36.909
Which gate is that again?

34:37.009 --> 34:40.080
<i>South side. This Post Two?</i>

34:41.280 --> 34:45.317
Hey, bro, can I get a better name
than Post Two? That's a total bitch name.

34:49.454 --> 34:51.473
<i>Who is this?</i>

35:04.702 --> 35:06.706
Will you quit touching shit?

35:07.106 --> 35:10.142
Hey, not all of us have our boyfriends
doing the heavy lifting.

35:10.242 --> 35:12.276
Fuck you!

35:12.376 --> 35:14.180
Fuck you!

35:14.580 --> 35:16.414
She's gone!

35:16.881 --> 35:18.850
- Shit!
- Shit!

35:19.617 --> 35:23.522
- Where the fuck did she go?
- I don't fucking know!

35:23.622 --> 35:25.424
Fucking kidding me!

35:42.273 --> 35:46.077
Nicki, we got a runner.
Eyes open, she might be headed your way.

35:53.217 --> 35:55.054
She's in the elevator.

35:56.888 --> 36:00.893
- It's okay, it's me, it's me!
- Thank God.

36:04.662 --> 36:08.099
Follow me, follow me!
Come on, come on, hurry up! Let's go!

36:09.333 --> 36:11.404
Where do you think you're going?

36:17.675 --> 36:20.145
- This way!
- No, this way!

36:21.614 --> 36:24.851
- Shit, fuck, fuck!
- Shit.

<i>"I don't believe in accidents.
There are only encounters in history...</i>

36:32.324 --> 36:34.793
<i>"...there are no accidents."</i>

36:44.835 --> 36:46.705
Oh, shit.

36:47.939 --> 36:49.775
You okay, bro?

36:55.077 --> 36:57.082
- God!
- What the fuck was that?

36:57.182 --> 37:01.160
- Get your ass in here, dude!
- What the fuck happened here?

37:02.581 --> 37:04.096
Hey, wait!

37:08.559 --> 37:11.297
- Let her go.
- Hey! Don't do anything stupid.

37:11.397 --> 37:13.966
Do it, baby. Pull the trigger. I want you to.

37:14.066 --> 37:17.670
- You want your money, you let her go.
- What's wrong?

37:18.870 --> 37:20.806
- I'll be right back.
- Oh, no, no...

37:20.906 --> 37:22.707
Don't move!

37:24.542 --> 37:26.411
What's going on?

37:29.630 --> 37:31.717
Baby, baby.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.523
Baby, it's okay, it's okay.

37:34.623 --> 37:37.937
Relax, it's okay.
Everything's okay, it's just a little...

37:38.037 --> 37:40.659
He's dead, he's dead!

37:40.759 --> 37:44.630
I know... I know he's dead
and I'm really sad about it, too.

37:44.730 --> 37:47.399
- I'm super sad.
- What the hell happened?

37:48.232 --> 37:50.068
Freak accident.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.778
- This...
- Babe, babe, I...

37:59.878 --> 38:02.714
I wanna go home, I can't do this anymore.

38:02.814 --> 38:05.462
I'm sorry, I can't do this anymore.

38:05.562 --> 38:08.888
No, listen, you can do this.
We can do this together.

38:08.988 --> 38:11.657
Because remember tonight,
it changes everything...

38:11.757 --> 38:15.627
...and if we can make it through tonight,
then come tomorrow...

38:15.727 --> 38:18.864
...we can have everything that we ever
wanted. Remember, happily ever after?

38:18.964 --> 38:23.702
We can't let one little accident
change that, right? Yeah!

38:23.802 --> 38:26.871
No, you can do it. Put that on.

38:27.306 --> 38:30.976
Let me hold that for just a second
while you put on your...

38:31.076 --> 38:32.677
Yeah.

38:32.777 --> 38:35.294
All right, there you go. There you go.

38:35.394 --> 38:37.829
This mask was a really good choice.

38:37.929 --> 38:40.619
You look great, really. Come on, atta girl!

38:40.719 --> 38:43.355
- Thank you.
- Go for it! Atta girl!

38:47.592 --> 38:49.628
- Come on!
- Clarence! What the...

38:49.728 --> 38:53.065
- I'll take care of everything. I promise.
- Move! Faster!

38:53.165 --> 38:55.734
What the fuck is this?
Was this part of the deal?

38:55.834 --> 38:58.503
How was I supposed to know
this was gonna happen?

38:59.070 --> 39:01.340
What am I supposed to do with this?

39:01.440 --> 39:06.089
That's funny, because I distinctly remember
you saying that no one would get hurt.

39:08.746 --> 39:11.149
Are you suggesting that this is my fault?

39:12.283 --> 39:16.055
Okay, no, no, I can fix this. I can fix this.

39:16.155 --> 39:19.024
Yeah, you're gonna fix this.
How are you gonna fix this?

39:19.891 --> 39:21.760
I'll pay you more money.

39:22.994 --> 39:25.230
Guess that changes the splits.

39:28.899 --> 39:30.536
Step into my office.

39:40.678 --> 39:43.582
- Talk to me.
- I'll pay you $30,000.

39:43.682 --> 39:47.953
You're suggesting that this dead young
man's life is only worth a $5,000 premium?

39:48.053 --> 39:52.291
No, no, I think that...

39:52.391 --> 39:55.761
Hey, hey, you, yeah, don't poke him.

39:55.861 --> 39:57.296
- What?
- He's dead.

39:57.396 --> 39:59.999
Okay, fine, fine, I'll pay you $50,000.

40:00.499 --> 40:03.935
- All right, I want it transferred now.
- No transfers, it's all going to be in cash.

40:04.035 --> 40:07.505
- Show it to me, where is it?
- You'll see it when I want you to see it.

40:08.539 --> 40:11.576
Clarence, do not get smart with me.

40:11.676 --> 40:14.980
I am not in the mood. There's a dead guy
we gotta deal with here...

40:15.080 --> 40:17.349
Hey, you want your money, I want my girl.

40:17.449 --> 40:21.420
So, you don't harm a hair on her head
or mine if you want to see that money.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.455
This was your idea, remember that.

40:24.555 --> 40:26.591
Yeah, all right, fine.

40:27.658 --> 40:30.352
- $75,000 it is.
- What?

40:30.778 --> 40:32.631
We just...

40:32.731 --> 40:37.102
Excuse me, but the game has changed
a little bit, don't you think?

40:37.202 --> 40:39.738
We're dealing with damages now, man.

40:39.838 --> 40:42.441
This dead guy here, he had nine kids.

40:42.541 --> 40:45.835
He had triplets three times over.
He didn't even know what a condom was...

40:45.935 --> 40:48.380
...and the fact of the matter is,
he's got a lot of obligations...

40:48.480 --> 40:51.049
...and now those obligations
are my obligations.

40:51.149 --> 40:55.821
It's gonna be on me and... it's where I'm
going after I get rid of his fucking corpse.

40:55.921 --> 40:59.257
Speaking of which, can you stop
doing drugs for a minute...

40:59.357 --> 41:02.026
...please, and just take care of this?

41:07.399 --> 41:09.068
Un-fucking-professional.

41:09.168 --> 41:11.235
Thank you.

41:11.769 --> 41:13.539
Are you coming back for him?

41:13.639 --> 41:15.707
I'm going to get help, asshole!

41:25.583 --> 41:28.505
Hey, will you call KJ...

41:28.755 --> 41:32.074
...I mean Selina
and get down here and help me?

41:32.174 --> 41:34.376
I will in a second.

41:36.861 --> 41:38.397
Please tell me you're not done with that.

41:38.497 --> 41:41.699
I've never fucking duct taped anyone before!

41:42.300 --> 41:43.902
Go!

41:51.309 --> 41:54.746
Hey, I'm really sorry about your friend.

41:55.479 --> 41:57.403
He wasn't my friend.

41:58.183 --> 42:01.787
Well, whoever he is,
I can tell it's really affecting you.

42:01.887 --> 42:05.136
Well, it's not. Please don't talk to me.

42:05.523 --> 42:09.994
Then what is? Listen, I can tell
you're a really good person...

42:10.094 --> 42:12.998
...you just got yourself
in a really tough situation.

42:13.098 --> 42:15.143
You don't know anything about me.

42:16.234 --> 42:19.104
You're right, I don't.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.875
My name's Alex.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.277
Am I allowed to know your name?

42:35.553 --> 42:38.849
Selina, can you come
help me with this, please?

42:39.891 --> 42:41.382
Selina!

42:42.081 --> 42:43.569
Selina?

42:50.534 --> 42:53.638
- She got away!
- What? Where is she?

42:53.738 --> 42:57.008
- I don't know, shut up!
- How could you let this happen again?

42:58.476 --> 43:00.311
Help me find her!

43:11.522 --> 43:14.359
Fuck. Oh, come on.

43:33.877 --> 43:35.405
Shit!

43:36.984 --> 43:38.538
Shit!

43:42.186 --> 43:44.388
Where are you, you little bitch!

43:51.445 --> 43:53.314
All clear!

44:26.897 --> 44:28.694
Oh, God.

44:35.105 --> 44:36.681
Gotcha!

44:39.006 --> 44:40.511
Shit!

44:44.014 --> 44:45.451
Shit!

44:53.258 --> 44:55.323
What the fuck are you doing?

44:56.526 --> 44:59.297
- What?
- Why aren't you answering?

44:59.397 --> 45:01.232
What are you talking about?

45:02.566 --> 45:06.992
Check, check! Son of a bitch,
you were on the wrong channel, KJ!

45:07.092 --> 45:09.107
All right. What are you...

45:11.341 --> 45:15.313
- Okay, that makes perfect sense.
- What makes sense?

45:15.413 --> 45:17.949
There was this guy
and he called me Post Two...

45:18.049 --> 45:21.219
...and I was like, listen, bitch,
I'm not Post Two, okay?

45:21.319 --> 45:23.154
Oh, my God!

45:23.654 --> 45:26.491
Hey, Emma?
Yeah, you're gonna want to get out here.

45:26.591 --> 45:28.826
<i>What's wrong?</i>

45:28.926 --> 45:32.110
We have a friend. And by, "a friend,"
I mean a potential enemy.

45:33.731 --> 45:35.734
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

45:38.735 --> 45:40.071
Not now.

45:46.644 --> 45:52.283
Dispatch, this is unit 219,
code 6 on a 459A...

45:52.383 --> 45:56.593
...at 585 Crescent Place, standby.

45:58.088 --> 45:59.891
Hi, there.

45:59.991 --> 46:05.297
Hi, there, hi.
What seems to be the issue, officer?

46:05.397 --> 46:08.267
We got a call from the security company
about an alarm here.

46:08.367 --> 46:11.602
They called for a response,
but didn't hear back.

46:15.856 --> 46:17.659
Is that so?

46:18.842 --> 46:20.879
Yes, that's so.

46:56.147 --> 46:59.593
Shit on Carl, shit on Carl.

46:59.693 --> 47:04.255
Patrick ain't got tickets to the gun show.

47:04.355 --> 47:06.158
Fuck, yeah!

47:16.417 --> 47:19.254
Don't worry, little darlin', he won't mind.

47:19.504 --> 47:21.340
Let me see that thing.

47:33.317 --> 47:37.922
- You're so fucking sick.
- Look, now we're twins.

47:41.191 --> 47:44.962
Do you want to tell me what it is you're
all doing out here at this time of night?

47:45.062 --> 47:50.755
Just helping our buddy
do some moving, you know?

47:51.535 --> 47:53.571
Right, Clarence?

47:54.938 --> 47:56.574
Yep.

48:01.645 --> 48:04.695
- Who owns the van?
- I do.

48:05.382 --> 48:09.253
- And you live here?
- Actually, I do, sir.

48:10.020 --> 48:11.522
Okay.

48:14.591 --> 48:17.595
Do you mind if I take a look
and see what's inside the van?

48:17.695 --> 48:20.789
No, don't mind at all.

48:37.014 --> 48:38.516
What...

48:38.749 --> 48:42.454
I need you to go get Clarence, please.
I want you to go get Clarence.

48:42.554 --> 48:45.644
Clarence is busy at the moment.
Can I take a message?

48:49.292 --> 48:50.428
Please go get Clarence.

48:50.528 --> 48:54.199
You don't need Clarence,
you got Carl right here.

48:54.699 --> 48:57.301
Carl? Is that your name?

48:57.401 --> 49:01.539
- I meant, Narl.
- No, no, you said, Carl.

49:01.639 --> 49:03.225
- Is Carl your name?
- No!

49:03.425 --> 49:05.243
- Yeah. Carl!
- No!

49:05.343 --> 49:07.811
- Carl!
- No!

49:08.312 --> 49:11.664
Don't say that! Don't you dare!

49:12.604 --> 49:16.481
- Don't do it, don't move! It's not worth it.
- Patrick, are you crazy?

49:16.581 --> 49:18.356
- It's either him or us, baby cakes.
- No!

49:18.456 --> 49:20.359
It doesn't have to go down
like this, Patrick.

49:20.459 --> 49:24.229
You know, it took you like
30 minutes to get here, man!

49:24.329 --> 49:26.131
Your response time sucks.

49:30.600 --> 49:34.172
- Hey! Get off her!
- Stay back, lover boy!

49:34.272 --> 49:37.542
<i>30th president of the United States
Calvin Coolidge once said...</i>

49:37.742 --> 49:41.212
<i>"Heroism is not only in the man,
but in the occasion."</i>

49:51.599 --> 49:53.224
- Fuck!
- What did you do?

49:53.324 --> 49:55.556
That was awesome!

49:59.796 --> 50:02.009
You fucking shot me.

50:03.467 --> 50:05.936
Fuck you, you little fucking...

50:16.844 --> 50:18.449
Turn off the fucking lights, KJ!

50:18.549 --> 50:21.519
Turn off the fucking lights
and put the body in the van!

50:21.619 --> 50:23.821
Fuck! Fuck!

50:35.899 --> 50:37.702
Get off me, son.

50:44.324 --> 50:47.528
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!

50:50.948 --> 50:53.117
You saved my life.

50:53.617 --> 50:55.687
What? Yeah.

50:56.087 --> 50:57.689
I guess I did.

51:00.457 --> 51:02.259
Clarence, look out!

51:02.926 --> 51:06.397
This whole thing has gone...

51:06.497 --> 51:08.383
...to shit!

51:09.400 --> 51:12.603
Stop it, stop it, you fucking coward!

51:12.703 --> 51:16.140
You're next. Get your ass up!

51:17.541 --> 51:19.043
Walk!

51:25.482 --> 51:27.018
Emma!

51:27.751 --> 51:29.587
I need you!

51:34.724 --> 51:36.330
Yes.

51:39.697 --> 51:41.532
This is fucking awesome.

51:42.033 --> 51:43.468
Get down the stairs.

51:43.568 --> 51:45.470
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Okay, okay!

51:45.570 --> 51:47.572
I swear to God, man.

51:49.106 --> 51:50.909
Go on!

51:51.309 --> 51:55.112
Real guns were not part of the plan!
He was trying to fucking kill her!

51:56.880 --> 52:00.527
- What the hell... what's going on here?
- The deal is done, Clarence...

52:00.627 --> 52:03.855
- ...the game has changed!
- No, wait, this is not what we agreed to!

52:03.955 --> 52:06.320
Fuck you, man!
Did you just shoot a fucking cop?

52:06.420 --> 52:08.930
If you hadn't of brought a gun
you wouldn't have just killed a fucking cop!

52:09.030 --> 52:11.897
If I hadn't brought the fucking gun
then we would all be in jail right now.

52:11.997 --> 52:15.366
So, shut your fucking mouth,
before I blow your nuts off...

52:15.466 --> 52:17.619
...and you won't even have a chance
to use them with your little crush!

52:17.719 --> 52:22.140
You saved the girl, you beat the bad guys.
You even took a fucking bullet for her!

52:22.240 --> 52:25.944
So, congratulations,
you're a goddamn hero, Clarence!

52:26.044 --> 52:29.614
Bullet, I didn't take a bullet. Oh, God!

52:29.714 --> 52:32.483
Always be the smartest guy
in the room, remember?

52:32.583 --> 52:34.352
What is wrong with you?

52:34.452 --> 52:38.042
It's $100,000 now
and it's non-fucking-negotiable!

52:38.142 --> 52:41.726
We have about 15, 20 minutes tops
until they come looking for that cop.

52:41.826 --> 52:44.762
You clean up the blood
and pull in the bodies, okay?

52:44.862 --> 52:49.551
Wait, when you say, "we",
you mean just me and KJ, right?

52:50.033 --> 52:53.271
Yes, I want you to clean it up.
I'm gonna go get the money.

52:53.371 --> 52:55.073
Why don't... why can't I go get the money?

52:55.173 --> 52:58.777
You can have all of Carl's share
just please do what I say!

52:59.177 --> 53:02.880
That's right, have the black guy
go clean everything up.

53:02.980 --> 53:04.783
I'm down with that.

53:08.051 --> 53:11.656
Yeah, cracker-ass cracker
is always telling me to clean shit up.

53:17.596 --> 53:20.131
Housekeeping, I'm here to clean up the mess.

53:20.231 --> 53:22.263
Oh, my God, this is disgusting.

53:22.363 --> 53:25.637
You've made such
a disgusting mess of this room.

53:26.637 --> 53:29.507
No, seriously, you really
did a number on my homies.

53:29.607 --> 53:33.611
Well, I mean, that guy's my homie,
I don't even know this guy.

53:33.711 --> 53:35.980
You know how hard it is to make friends?

53:45.689 --> 53:47.525
Dap it...

53:48.125 --> 53:49.960
...pound it...

53:51.628 --> 53:53.463
...my ninja.

53:56.800 --> 54:00.288
You stay there, okay? You, too.

54:19.723 --> 54:21.005
Heavy.

54:23.593 --> 54:28.433
- Oh, honey bunny, talk to me.
- I can't... I can't do it anymore.

54:29.133 --> 54:32.580
Everything is going wrong, people are dying.

54:33.370 --> 54:35.106
This wasn't a part of the plan.

54:35.206 --> 54:37.442
You can't plan for this sort of thing, honey.

54:37.542 --> 54:40.929
I mean, nobody knows
what's going to happen really...

54:41.029 --> 54:44.882
- ...that's why they're called accidents.
- But you just shot that guy.

54:44.982 --> 54:49.254
He wanted it, he was asking for it.
It's like a badge of honor for him.

54:49.354 --> 54:54.041
But the police are gonna come
and they're gonna accuse us...

54:54.625 --> 54:58.203
- They're gonna accuse us of murder.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

54:58.303 --> 55:01.796
Honey, honey, look at me, look at me. No.

55:03.318 --> 55:04.868
No.

55:07.004 --> 55:09.039
I'm gonna clean that up, too.

55:35.031 --> 55:39.070
There's nothing to worry about, we're gonna
be long gone by the time the cops get here.

55:39.170 --> 55:42.907
- They won't even know that we were here.
- I'm just gonna go to the van.

55:43.007 --> 55:47.611
No, no, I need you here watching Alex
so that I can go and find the money.

55:48.946 --> 55:51.649
Why did you say her name like that?

55:51.749 --> 55:55.693
- What do you mean?
- You just said "Alex" so casually...

55:56.293 --> 55:59.290
- ...it's weird.
- Well, yeah, I mean, that's her name.

55:59.390 --> 56:03.794
People call each other by their
fucking names, right? What the fuck?

56:03.894 --> 56:08.266
It's a name, that's what you're
supposed to call somebody by, right?

56:08.366 --> 56:12.137
Is that... that? What do you call somebody by
if you don't call somebody by their name?

56:12.237 --> 56:14.605
Okay, I'm sorry.

56:14.705 --> 56:17.008
I'm just really freaking out.

56:17.108 --> 56:19.376
I know, sweetheart, I know.

56:21.044 --> 56:23.915
I'm here to protect you. Okay?

56:24.615 --> 56:26.149
Okay.

56:38.762 --> 56:42.833
You know... I've never been
with a woman before.

56:59.149 --> 57:02.917
I was gonna wait until later, but you
know me, I'm just a hopeless romantic...

57:03.017 --> 57:07.290
...and I think it might help you see
the finish line a little more clearly.

57:11.795 --> 57:15.463
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah. Yeah.

57:15.563 --> 57:17.634
Yeah, it's... yep.

57:19.202 --> 57:22.373
You know, we can make some
adjustments to it, so it fits better.

57:22.473 --> 57:24.943
It's custom made. There's only one
like it in the whole wide world.

57:25.043 --> 57:28.479
- I love it! Yeah?
- You love it? Yeah? Oh, good.

57:29.472 --> 57:31.315
Just congratulations.

57:33.249 --> 57:35.104
Are you happy?

57:36.527 --> 57:40.720
Good. We gotta get that money
so I can afford to pay off that ring.

57:43.960 --> 57:47.397
Why don't you go take care of her
and I'll go find that cash?

57:48.531 --> 57:50.334
I love you.

57:52.502 --> 57:54.328
I know.

58:17.927 --> 58:20.164
This is so fucking ninja.

58:26.102 --> 58:29.306
<i>10-18, can I get a status check
on Crescent Place?</i>

58:42.018 --> 58:43.888
Code 6, standby.

58:43.988 --> 58:45.789
<i>10-4.</i>

58:55.766 --> 58:59.169
How's it going? Where were we?

59:00.103 --> 59:01.906
The money.

59:02.206 --> 59:05.092
I can't... I can't believe you shot me.

59:05.192 --> 59:08.379
Yeah, and I'll shoot you again if you don't
tell me where the fucking money is, man.

59:08.479 --> 59:10.895
Come on, Clarence. Work with me.

59:18.421 --> 59:20.290
It's in the pool.

59:21.090 --> 59:25.029
- What do you mean it's in the pool?
- It's in the pool.

59:25.129 --> 59:27.872
Like... like it's floating in the pool?

59:27.972 --> 59:30.534
What is it like wet bills?
Am I going to have to fish it out?

59:30.634 --> 59:33.670
Come on, Clarence,
you gonna piss me off here?

59:33.770 --> 59:35.605
It's in a case.

59:37.974 --> 59:39.510
Like a box?

59:39.610 --> 59:42.939
Like a case... like a fuck...

59:43.846 --> 59:45.216
Sealed? Water tight?

59:45.316 --> 59:49.153
Like a Pulp Fiction transporter fucking case.

59:52.121 --> 59:54.192
Clarence, you crazy bastard!

59:55.392 --> 59:57.661
All right, well, let's go for a dip!

59:57.761 --> 01:00:01.365
- Yeah, fuck, yeah.
- What the fuck is that?

01:00:01.465 --> 01:00:04.836
Oh, yeah, I found it in the cop car.
It's really cool, right?

01:00:04.936 --> 01:00:07.305
It's like... I think it's like
super like powerful and shit.

01:00:07.405 --> 01:00:10.474
- Okay, give it to me.
- No! No fucking way, man!

01:00:10.574 --> 01:00:11.909
Give me the fucking gun!

01:00:12.009 --> 01:00:14.778
Hey, you haven't given me
a gun all night, okay?

01:00:14.878 --> 01:00:18.405
Then I go out on my own accord
and find the biggest, the baddest...

01:00:18.505 --> 01:00:22.319
...the most dope gun and then
you try to take it away from me?

01:00:22.419 --> 01:00:25.490
Like, no, man, fuck you!

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:29.960
Fine, hang onto it, you're gonna kill
yourself with it anyway. Let's get to work.

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:33.373
You're a dick, and I found another gun, too
and I'm not even telling you about that.

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:36.865
Hi.

01:00:37.369 --> 01:00:39.413
I'm really sorry you got shot...

01:00:39.813 --> 01:00:43.374
...but would you telling me where the
cleaning products are? It'd be super helpful.

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:50.481
I'm sorry it had to go down
like this, Clarence.

01:00:50.581 --> 01:00:53.797
You know, but think about it this way.
You'll have a good story to tell...

01:00:53.897 --> 01:00:57.588
...you're gonna have a hell of a scar.
Chicks dig that sort of thing, man.

01:00:57.688 --> 01:00:59.894
I'm a little jealous, personally.

01:01:03.198 --> 01:01:05.129
You sneaky son of a bitch.

01:01:05.229 --> 01:01:08.972
- Never would have guessed.
- Well, I'm just full of surprises.

01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:32.456
Hey, my music isn't
bothering you guys, right?

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:40.564
Ready for it, ready for it.
Oh, yeah, dance funk.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.610
- That's been in there the whole night?
- Yeah.

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:55.814
That means there's only $25,000 in there.

01:01:56.827 --> 01:01:59.111
Well, you better go in and fucking get it.

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:03.220
Does it look like I'm in the mood
for a fucking swim?

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.409
Does it look like I give a shit?

01:02:10.563 --> 01:02:13.674
You ever hear the expression,
"shooting fish in a barrel?"

01:02:36.519 --> 01:02:39.443
Yo, why is this place empty!

01:02:58.808 --> 01:03:01.255
Damn, you're one good-looking motherfucker.

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:48.392
Congratulations.

01:03:49.091 --> 01:03:50.661
Thank you.

01:03:50.761 --> 01:03:53.797
I can't really see it,
but it looks really beautiful.

01:03:53.897 --> 01:03:55.699
You must be super happy.

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:58.268
Yeah, I am.

01:03:58.368 --> 01:04:02.005
I'd love to see it.
I mean, if you're okay with that.

01:04:02.105 --> 01:04:03.841
I know we don't really know
each other and everything...

01:04:03.941 --> 01:04:08.240
...but what girl doesn't wanna
show off her engagement ring? Right?

01:04:12.115 --> 01:04:13.975
You're right.

01:04:14.618 --> 01:04:18.055
Technically,
you are the first person to know.

01:04:18.905 --> 01:04:22.956
- It's supposed to be your best friend, right?
- Well, it was when I got engaged.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.863
You were married?

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:28.499
Technically I still am.

01:04:29.445 --> 01:04:31.252
What happened?

01:04:32.302 --> 01:04:34.171
Can I see it?

01:04:40.593 --> 01:04:44.273
What happened was, I married the asshole
that gave you my wedding ring.

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:58.071
Think I got all night?

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:03.566
Come on, give it to me.

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:07.304
- You shot my arm.
- Give it to me!

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:08.938
Jesus!

01:05:09.706 --> 01:05:14.211
You know, this is a $500 jacket, man!
I'm still making payments on it.

01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:18.379
Give it to me. Come on, come on.

01:05:46.909 --> 01:05:50.680
- What the fuck happened to you?
- He ran around to the front of the house.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.713
Go cut him off.

01:05:52.813 --> 01:05:57.387
Okay, cool. Anyways, this guy...
he's not Clarence Duffield, just saying.

01:05:57.487 --> 01:05:59.289
Look what I found.

01:06:01.824 --> 01:06:03.110
I'm out.

01:06:28.684 --> 01:06:30.687
You gotta be kidding me.

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:33.924
Hi, Patrick!

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:37.961
Hi-ya, Alex!

01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:40.865
What happened here?

01:06:41.665 --> 01:06:45.503
You know, Alex pointed out something
really interesting about the wedding ring.

01:06:47.938 --> 01:06:51.508
Now, why would we want to let
a little thing like that bother us?

01:06:51.608 --> 01:06:53.611
You're an asshole.

01:06:53.911 --> 01:06:57.681
Yeah, but you knew that, didn't you?

01:06:57.781 --> 01:07:02.066
You proposed to me
with your ex-wife's wedding ring!

01:07:03.086 --> 01:07:06.057
- Technically, we're still married.
- Technically.

01:07:07.127 --> 01:07:10.756
And we did kidnap her tonight so,
you know, what do you expect?

01:07:17.633 --> 01:07:21.638
- <i>Yo, pick up, dude.</i>
- Excuse me. Gotta take this.

01:07:22.565 --> 01:07:26.277
- Sorry, go again.
- <i>Yo, we ain't got no wheels.</i>

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.240
If it ain't one thing it's another, right?

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:35.136
Listen, girls, I would love to just keep
going around and around like this...

01:07:35.236 --> 01:07:40.057
- ...really hash it out.
- No. No, this ends now!

01:07:40.157 --> 01:07:43.694
We are going to figure out how
to make this all fucking work...

01:07:43.794 --> 01:07:46.263
...and then we are gonna go
our separate ways.

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:52.235
So, we're through?

01:07:52.501 --> 01:07:54.571
Yeah, we're through.

01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:03.146
All right, but you ain't getting
none of this score.

01:08:04.627 --> 01:08:06.733
And I'm gonna need that ring back.

01:08:07.183 --> 01:08:09.452
Screw you, Patrick.

01:08:11.687 --> 01:08:14.838
I'm running a little bit low on time.

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:39.582
Hey, Clarence!

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:42.752
Where you at, white boy?

01:08:47.622 --> 01:08:49.438
I'm gonna get you.

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:53.096
Come on.

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:56.033
Don't you know ninjas can see in the dark?

01:09:15.385 --> 01:09:17.187
You almost got got, bitch!

01:09:21.124 --> 01:09:23.131
Alex, come on!

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:34.383
You threw a fucking gun at me, you bitch!

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.234
Motherfucker!

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:03.233
Clarence!

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:12.509
Yo, quit being a little bitch!

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:19.816
<i>The police will be here any minute.</i>

01:10:19.916 --> 01:10:22.452
<i>If you're smart,
you'll get out while you still can.</i>

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:24.187
Never!

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:45.008
Marco?

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.888
Marco?

01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:09.432
Yo, I'm gonna kill you, big man!

01:11:25.913 --> 01:11:27.484
Clarence!

01:11:29.017 --> 01:11:31.220
I thought you were dead.

01:11:49.205 --> 01:11:52.243
I really didn't think
I was ever gonna see you again.

01:11:52.943 --> 01:11:56.591
Don't worry, I'm incredibly determined.

01:11:58.872 --> 01:12:00.750
What happened?

01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:02.853
Patrick shot me!

01:12:03.553 --> 01:12:05.422
Are you okay?

01:12:06.122 --> 01:12:07.924
I don't know.

01:12:09.392 --> 01:12:11.394
Let's go, we can't stay here, let's go!

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:19.574
I got you mother-truckers now.

01:12:35.183 --> 01:12:38.822
Clarence?
You're literally killing me right now.

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:41.859
<i>Political activist Emma Goldman once said...</i>

01:12:41.959 --> 01:12:45.771
<i>"The most violent element
in society is ignorance."</i>

01:12:51.234 --> 01:12:52.836
Shit!

01:13:22.097 --> 01:13:23.900
I didn't think you'd still be here!

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.670
Yeah, well I had some unfinished business!

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:36.346
You're wasting time, Patrick,
cops are on their way!

01:13:36.446 --> 01:13:38.249
Yeah, I know!

01:13:39.249 --> 01:13:43.177
Say, you're not just some
rich kid with a crush, are ya?

01:13:46.689 --> 01:13:48.258
Nope.

01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:51.364
You were playing me from the beginning.

01:13:51.464 --> 01:13:53.096
Yep.

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:58.034
Say, where'd you get the money
that you gave me to begin with?

01:13:58.134 --> 01:14:00.970
My grandmother actually gave me
a little money when she died.

01:14:02.489 --> 01:14:04.942
You're not a Duffield, are you?

01:14:05.742 --> 01:14:07.278
Nope.

01:14:08.278 --> 01:14:11.214
Yeah, piece of shit car
in the garage gave you away.

01:14:11.314 --> 01:14:14.509
- What happened to the nice one?
- It was a rental.

01:14:14.609 --> 01:14:16.485
And the house?

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:21.558
Craigslist, vacation rental section.

01:14:21.658 --> 01:14:23.900
Couple grand for a few nights.

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:26.831
Not a bad deal.

01:14:27.681 --> 01:14:30.029
Not gonna get your deposit back, though.

01:14:32.791 --> 01:14:34.320
Shit.

01:14:36.527 --> 01:14:39.341
Sounds like you're all
out of bargaining chips.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.882
Hey, Alex, you wanna hear a secret?

01:14:54.923 --> 01:14:58.484
Looks like we got ourselves
a little Mexican standoff here.

01:15:04.599 --> 01:15:06.690
Minus the Mexican.

01:15:08.674 --> 01:15:12.542
Didn't anyone ever tell you not to bring
a knife to a gunfight, Clarence?

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:18.948
Say, baby cakes,
what if I told you that Clarence here...

01:15:19.048 --> 01:15:22.162
...had this whole night
planned out from the get go?

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.788
He did. It's true.

01:15:27.923 --> 01:15:29.738
He hired me...

01:15:30.805 --> 01:15:32.615
...to kidnap you.

01:15:33.396 --> 01:15:37.100
So that he could save
your life and look like the hero.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.969
Me!

01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:43.139
Can you believe it?
I mean, what are the odds, right?

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:45.676
That's what I thought.

01:15:46.476 --> 01:15:49.125
But it turns out that Clarence...

01:15:49.225 --> 01:15:53.458
...knew who I was the entire time.

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:59.482
What I can't figure out is why
he would want to fuck with me!

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:07.612
But I think now's a pretty good time
for you to tell us, Clarence...

01:16:07.712 --> 01:16:09.533
...I think we're all ears.

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:15.636
Well, it's exactly like you said.
She needed a hero.

01:16:17.439 --> 01:16:19.976
I've been going to that bar for years.

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:23.594
I was there when you two were happily
married and I watched it go sour.

01:16:25.214 --> 01:16:27.651
You're a pretty shitty guy, Patrick.

01:16:27.951 --> 01:16:31.154
I knew you wouldn't pass up an opportunity
to make a little money off killing your wife...

01:16:31.254 --> 01:16:33.291
...and getting her grandmother's money.

01:16:34.491 --> 01:16:37.093
That is why you won't sign
the divorce papers, right?

01:16:37.193 --> 01:16:40.654
The inheritance? As long as you're
married, you still control half of it...

01:16:40.754 --> 01:16:43.414
...just as soon as you can find
a way to get a hold of it.

01:16:43.966 --> 01:16:46.469
See, I pay attention to the details.

01:16:46.569 --> 01:16:49.072
That's how I know what
an amazing woman Alex really is...

01:16:49.172 --> 01:16:52.408
...even if she was too hurt
from you to show it to anyone.

01:16:52.508 --> 01:16:56.579
When I told you I wanted
to be her hero, I meant it.

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:02.099
So, it turns out you were
our real villain all along.

01:17:07.522 --> 01:17:11.950
That is incredibly beautiful, man.

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:17.532
I mean, that was... it's poetic.

01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:22.305
Really tugged at every single one
of my little heart strings.

01:17:24.973 --> 01:17:27.994
This broke loser paid me to kidnap you...

01:17:28.094 --> 01:17:30.997
...put your life at risk, got you shot!

01:17:31.097 --> 01:17:35.117
Does that sound like prince
fucking charming to you, Alex?

01:17:36.702 --> 01:17:38.942
Does that seem like a hero to you?

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:43.628
I got news for you, baby.

01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:46.926
I got news for you, too.

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:50.633
I don't think the hero's gonna win this time.

01:17:54.767 --> 01:17:56.205
Fuck!

01:17:56.305 --> 01:17:59.409
Fuck! Shit! That hurt!

01:17:59.509 --> 01:18:01.544
Yeah, it does.

01:18:02.945 --> 01:18:05.381
It's getting very interesting tonight.

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:10.899
I think it's time you take
a look inside that case.

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:29.665
The combination is 1-4-3.

01:19:03.151 --> 01:19:06.108
Always be the smartest man
in the room, Patrick.

01:19:10.045 --> 01:19:13.917
The choice is yours. If you sign those
papers, you can walk out of here...

01:19:14.017 --> 01:19:17.822
...free to go on with your
pathetic excuse of a life. Or...

01:19:19.022 --> 01:19:22.057
...Alex can decide what to do
with you if you don't.

01:21:00.255 --> 01:21:02.182
I don't even know what to say.

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:06.263
You don't have to say anything.

01:21:06.963 --> 01:21:08.965
I did what I came here to do.

01:21:13.752 --> 01:21:15.554
I wanted to help.

01:21:17.038 --> 01:21:18.595
Why?

01:21:19.403 --> 01:21:21.190
You don't even know me.

01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:24.414
Because I love you, Alex.

01:21:24.964 --> 01:21:27.384
I have from the first moment I saw you.

01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:32.603
Heck, I've been coming to your bar
every night for years, I don't even drink.

01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:35.846
I wanted to know you.

01:21:36.959 --> 01:21:38.844
I really wanted to know you.

01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:42.832
I saw what he was doing
to you and I hated it.

01:21:42.932 --> 01:21:45.385
For me, sure, but more for you.

01:21:46.351 --> 01:21:48.438
You deserve so much better.

01:21:49.138 --> 01:21:51.436
I saw it, you wouldn't give anyone the time
of day because you were too busy...

01:21:51.536 --> 01:21:54.377
...guarding yourself from ever
being hurt like that again.

01:21:54.477 --> 01:21:58.160
When you guard yourself from pain you're also
preventing yourself from ever being loved.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:04.853
So you almost killed me
to show me that I'm alive?

01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:10.426
Yeah, something like that.

01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:14.931
So what happens now?

01:22:15.031 --> 01:22:18.401
The way I see it,
I think we only have two options.

01:22:18.501 --> 01:22:20.903
Option one, you shoot me.

01:22:21.003 --> 01:22:23.746
I deserve it. I put your life in danger.

01:22:23.846 --> 01:22:27.977
I fed you to the lion that was
your husband or ex-husband now.

01:22:28.077 --> 01:22:30.747
That seems only right that since
I put your life in danger...

01:22:30.847 --> 01:22:34.283
...you have my permission
to let you do the same.

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:39.458
Or option two. You let the police
arrest me and storm the house.

01:22:39.558 --> 01:22:42.659
I'll go quietly and plead guilty
to any charge they give me.

01:22:42.759 --> 01:22:45.024
Only you need to promise me something.

01:22:45.594 --> 01:22:47.630
I need you to promise me that from now on...

01:22:47.730 --> 01:22:49.999
...you're gonna live your life
with your head up...

01:22:50.099 --> 01:22:53.536
...and know that you deserve
happiness every single day.

01:22:53.636 --> 01:22:57.651
Because somewhere out there,
there's this really messed up boy...

01:22:57.751 --> 01:23:02.592
...who loves this beautiful,
beautiful broken girl...

01:23:04.112 --> 01:23:06.582
...who doesn't know
what she's missing out on.

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:28.470
But both of those options
don't really seem that positive for you.

01:23:29.072 --> 01:23:32.169
I don't think I really deserve
anything positive at the moment.

01:23:32.892 --> 01:23:35.692
Now it seems like you're the one that's
shutting out the potential happiness...

01:23:35.792 --> 01:23:37.678
...in your life.

01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:42.456
What would option three be?

01:23:44.187 --> 01:23:46.142
Option three?

01:23:46.522 --> 01:23:48.035
Yeah.

01:23:49.159 --> 01:23:51.446
There's gotta be option three.

01:23:53.029 --> 01:23:56.679
Well, if there's an option three,
I guess it'd have to be...

01:23:57.305 --> 01:24:03.408
