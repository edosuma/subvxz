04:25.468 --> 04:27.328
So, do you know much
about the institute?

04:27.428 --> 04:30.968
We work with some 600
athletes all over Australia.

04:31.068 --> 04:33.448
Many of whom will go on
to join the Olympic team.

Why do you swim?

04:49.268 --> 04:50.608
He was born swimming, I reckon.

Come on, guys.
Last class of the day.

07:09.908 --> 07:12.928
The unconscious mind
is a part of our brain

07:13.028 --> 07:14.888
that we can't directly access.

07:14.988 --> 07:17.568
When we block things out -

07:17.668 --> 07:20.328
bad memories, trauma -

07:20.428 --> 07:22.368
it leaves our conscious mind

07:22.468 --> 07:25.368
but stays in our
unconscious mind.

07:25.468 --> 07:27.468
That's why we
make bad decisions.

07:30.588 --> 07:32.768
If we make our
unconscious conscious,

07:32.868 --> 07:36.348
we take full control
of our own actions.

lose focus, I promise.

issuing the challenge.

length, the margin.

have it to themselves,

13:28.108 --> 13:30.608
although Palmer is
starting to finish fast.

down here with Ian Thorpe,

That was the best
tactical race I've ever seen.

14:05.828 --> 14:07.368
THORPE: I don't know
about that, you know?

14:07.468 --> 14:09.888
I wasn't too sure how I
was gonna do it, you know.

14:09.988 --> 14:11.328
It paid off this time.

can't get over this...
