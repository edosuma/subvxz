WEBVTT

00:02.511 --> 00:04.157
Come on, guys, I got class
in 15 minutes.

00:04.277 --> 00:05.360
This should not be
that difficult.

00:05.394 --> 00:06.828
We just need
to figure out an idea

00:06.863 --> 00:08.180
for our final history project.

00:08.214 --> 00:09.581
What we need to figure out

00:09.615 --> 00:11.817
is Greendale's obsession
with group assignments.

00:11.851 --> 00:13.835
[Scoffs]
Classic herd mentality.

00:13.870 --> 00:16.438
All right, Britta
doesn't have one. Who else?

00:16.472 --> 00:19.074
I've been told
I look like a Kennedy.

00:19.108 --> 00:20.542
Nope, not an idea.
That's a statement.

00:20.576 --> 00:22.093
Anyone not on medication?

00:22.128 --> 00:23.962
Jeff, we have
to take this seriously.

00:23.996 --> 00:26.781
This assignment?
This, we have to take seriously?

00:26.816 --> 00:29.117
"Pick any moment from history
and tell me about it.

00:29.151 --> 00:31.369
"Be as creative as you want.
Or not. I don't care.

00:31.404 --> 00:32.804
Professor Cornwaaa--"

00:32.839 --> 00:34.222
He didn't even finish
signing his name.

00:34.257 --> 00:36.441
Okay, yes,
he phoned this one in,

00:36.475 --> 00:38.994
but my run at Valedictorian
is in jeopardy.

00:39.028 --> 00:40.912
- As is mine.
- As is Shirley's,

00:40.947 --> 00:42.531
and I just took one
for the team

00:42.565 --> 00:44.382
by accepting that C-plus
on our last history paper.

00:44.433 --> 00:46.351
- As did I.
- As did Shirley.

00:46.402 --> 00:48.053
So I'd think you'd want
to rise to the occasion

00:48.087 --> 00:49.738
- and help get me back on top.
- Or me.

00:49.858 --> 00:52.924
Shirley, I'm speaking
for both you and me.

00:52.959 --> 00:54.176
Then, you might want
to teach your mouth

00:54.210 --> 00:57.212
how to say "we," "our,"
and "us."

00:57.230 --> 00:59.998
I've been told
I look like a Kennedy.

01:00.032 --> 01:01.433
Nope, still
just a random statement,

01:01.467 --> 01:02.434
and still useless.

01:02.468 --> 01:04.135
Okay.
How about this?

01:04.170 --> 01:06.621
- We do a series of banners--
- Great, it's settled.

01:06.655 --> 01:07.989
You don't even know
what I'm going to say!

01:08.007 --> 01:09.174
Don't need to.
Tomorrow is Friday,

01:09.225 --> 01:10.725
and I have no intention
of being here late.

01:10.760 --> 01:12.477
Your banner thing
sounds doable,

01:12.511 --> 01:15.146
and this assignment?
Passable, so passable.

01:15.198 --> 01:17.499
And passable
assures my graduation,

01:17.533 --> 01:19.567
so we are doing doable
and passable.

01:19.585 --> 01:23.255
Uh, speaking of tomorrow,
Troy and Britta,

01:23.306 --> 01:24.872
have you decided
what you're gonna do

01:24.891 --> 01:26.191
for your
one-year anniversary?

01:26.225 --> 01:28.476
Both: Of?

01:28.511 --> 01:30.495
Your first date?

01:30.529 --> 01:31.830
- Oh!
- Da-doy.

01:31.864 --> 01:33.314
Yeah! [Scoffs]
That was a test,

01:33.332 --> 01:34.266
- and you failed.
- I was just kidding.

01:34.300 --> 01:35.950
You guys are dating?
Man!

01:35.968 --> 01:39.354
Somebody's sure working her way
around the table.

01:39.388 --> 01:40.755
Aren't you?

01:40.773 --> 01:42.173
Well, you should really
do something special,

01:42.208 --> 01:43.692
- something romantic.
- Mm-hmm.

01:43.726 --> 01:47.562
Like go back to Senor Kevin's
for lunch, where it all began.

01:47.597 --> 01:49.247
- [Giggles]
- Yeah, sure.

01:49.298 --> 01:50.548
We could do that.

01:50.583 --> 01:53.034
Sure, that sounds fun.

01:53.069 --> 01:54.335
Speaking of anniversaries,

01:54.353 --> 01:56.821
it is the third anniversary
of me and Abed

01:56.856 --> 01:58.473
watching <i>Freaky Friday</i>
for the first time.

01:58.491 --> 02:01.860
Both: Oh...
That, you remember?

02:01.894 --> 02:03.211
Movie Trolley is having

02:03.246 --> 02:04.512
an "End of the Video Store
Chain Industry" sale,

02:04.547 --> 02:06.414
so I got you a six-pack
of "body switching" movies

02:06.432 --> 02:07.515
and a two-year-old box
of Raisinets,

02:07.550 --> 02:10.901
- all for under five bucks.
- Whoo!

02:10.937 --> 02:12.837
All right, man.
<i>Change Up.</i>

02:12.872 --> 02:15.240

02:16.275 --> 02:17.676
- [Gasps]
- Judge Reinhold.

02:17.710 --> 02:18.993
Both: Oh.

02:19.011 --> 02:20.996
<i>Freaky Friday.</i>

02:21.030 --> 02:24.349
[Stilted] Oh, Troy,
you are so thoughtful.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.719
I wish I had the capacity
for sentimentality like you do.

02:27.753 --> 02:31.206
[Stilted] Me?
I wish I was more like you.

02:31.240 --> 02:34.342
No emotional hang-ups,
endless cool adventures.

02:34.376 --> 02:35.560
You have it so easy.

02:35.594 --> 02:37.479
No, you do, Troy.

02:37.513 --> 02:38.913
No, you do, Abed.

02:38.948 --> 02:40.515
Both: I wish I could
switch places with you

02:40.533 --> 02:42.067
for just one day!

02:42.118 --> 02:48.006

- Oh.

Routine light switch check.

02:59.518 --> 03:00.919
- [Sighs]
- Oh.

03:00.970 --> 03:02.170
I thought that would work.

[Direct, as Abed]
Yes. That would be this day.

03:44.163 --> 03:46.948
Look, I know that
it was awkward yesterday.

03:46.966 --> 03:48.833
They pointed it out
and we didn't remember,

03:48.884 --> 03:50.284
but-- [Scoffs]
that doesn't mean

03:50.302 --> 03:51.469
that we should feel pressure

03:51.520 --> 03:53.254
to make some big deal
out of it, right?

03:53.272 --> 03:55.240
No, I'm looking forward to it.

03:55.274 --> 03:59.511
Super looking forward to it.
I'm just saying...

03:59.545 --> 04:02.280
Yeah.

04:02.314 --> 04:04.399
Same page.

04:04.433 --> 04:06.885
Excuse me.

04:08.571 --> 04:10.572
Hey, buddy, wake up!

04:10.606 --> 04:12.707
Remember yesterday, when we
faked a body switching thing

04:12.742 --> 04:14.125
and it didn't work?

04:14.160 --> 04:17.077
Well, now,
it's actually worked.

04:18.346 --> 04:21.382
- So, right now--
- I'm you and you're me.

04:25.121 --> 04:26.404
[Emoting, as Troy] Oh, my God.

04:26.455 --> 04:28.823
This is wrinkling my brain!
And of all the days!

04:28.857 --> 04:30.775
I got my big, important meeting
with my study group.

04:30.810 --> 04:31.876
Me too.

04:31.927 --> 04:33.812
Oh, boy.
Here goes nothing.

04:36.465 --> 04:38.733
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

04:38.767 --> 04:41.936
Huh.

04:41.954 --> 04:43.237
Okay,
so we're telling the story

04:43.255 --> 04:45.490
of the American revolution
through banners.

04:45.524 --> 04:47.225
Everyone is responsible
for one.

04:47.259 --> 04:49.544
To maximize efficiency,
I've designated areas:

04:49.562 --> 04:52.680
Colored pencils and markers,
paints, puffy paint--

04:52.698 --> 04:54.466
Yes, there's a difference.

04:54.500 --> 04:58.420
Decoupage and glitter,
a-a-and...

04:58.454 --> 05:00.388
this is the approval station,

05:00.423 --> 05:01.473
where Shirley and I will decide

05:01.507 --> 05:02.774
whether you have
to start over or not.

05:02.808 --> 05:06.661
Annie, remember.
We're doing doable and passable.

05:06.695 --> 05:09.747
We're doing whatever it takes
to help us...

05:09.782 --> 05:11.416
- Thank you.
- ...beat Leonard.

05:11.450 --> 05:13.334
Wait, Leonard is now

05:13.369 --> 05:14.986
the front runner
for Valedictorian?

05:15.020 --> 05:16.604
You're getting beat by Leonard?

05:16.639 --> 05:19.257
- [Chuckles] He's so old.
- All right.

05:19.291 --> 05:21.025
Yes, we slipped below Leonard,

05:21.076 --> 05:23.728
but Annie and I are a close
three and two, respectively.

05:23.762 --> 05:25.513
[Low] Annie is the three.

05:25.548 --> 05:27.866
That is what "respectively"
suggests.

05:27.900 --> 05:31.452
[Mumbling]

05:31.470 --> 05:33.421
Mm-hmm.

05:35.541 --> 05:38.259
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

[Chuckles]
Whoa! That was weird.

05:41.313 --> 05:42.763
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

05:42.781 --> 05:44.933
We didn't mean to do that.
We know exactly where we sit.

05:44.967 --> 05:48.353
Um, what's going on
with you guys?

05:48.387 --> 05:50.088
Both: Oh, thank God,
you noticed.

05:50.139 --> 05:52.023
Remember when we pretended
to switch bodies yesterday?

05:52.057 --> 05:54.142
Unfortunately, yes, dorks.

05:54.176 --> 05:55.896
Well, it really happened.
I'm actually Abed.

05:55.928 --> 05:58.046
- And I'm actually Troy.
- All right.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.814
I don't care who's who.

05:59.848 --> 06:02.150
We're all here,
and that's all I need

06:02.184 --> 06:04.068
to complete
this passable project

06:04.119 --> 06:05.703
in a doable amount of time.

06:05.738 --> 06:07.038
Wish we could help, Jeff,

06:07.089 --> 06:08.540
but in order to switch back,
we have to recreate

06:08.591 --> 06:09.707
the exact moment
that all this happened,

06:09.758 --> 06:11.509
- but the DVD is missing.
- Of course it is.

06:11.544 --> 06:12.827
So now, I have to find it

06:12.845 --> 06:14.279
while Troy goes on
an anniversary date with Britta.

06:14.313 --> 06:15.630
What?

06:15.664 --> 06:16.631
- [Mimics gunshot]
- Oh, hey.

06:16.649 --> 06:17.932
Here's a fun sci-fi thing.

06:17.966 --> 06:19.634
How about you make a banner
as Troy

06:19.652 --> 06:21.135
and you make a banner as Abed,

06:21.153 --> 06:22.437
and we'll be done
within the hour.

06:22.471 --> 06:24.906
Uh, per banner, if we're lucky.

06:24.940 --> 06:26.407
And that's
if we want an "A."

06:26.442 --> 06:28.409
Okay, you two need
to let go of the pressure

06:28.443 --> 06:29.861
you're putting on this project
to get an "A."

06:29.895 --> 06:31.296
Both: I deserve
to be number one!

06:31.347 --> 06:33.214
Sorry. Or me!

06:33.248 --> 06:35.300
Sorry.

06:35.334 --> 06:39.053
- I have to go talk to Troy.
- Yes, please.

06:39.087 --> 06:40.605
Tell your boyfriend
and his boyfriend

06:40.639 --> 06:42.140
that playtime is over.

06:42.191 --> 06:45.159
Annie, Shirley, go find out
what's keeping Leonard on top.

06:45.194 --> 06:47.195
And Abed won't switch back
until we get that DVD.

06:47.229 --> 06:48.246
I'll deal with that.

06:48.280 --> 06:49.647
And then,
we are meeting back here

06:49.682 --> 06:51.583
and getting up
into some puffy paint

06:51.634 --> 06:53.534
and doing our doable,
passable banners!

06:53.552 --> 06:54.802
What do you want me to do?

06:54.837 --> 06:56.671
Stay alive.

06:56.705 --> 06:57.655
Or don't.

06:57.690 --> 06:59.307
I'm on it.

06:59.341 --> 07:00.508
Wait, Troy!

07:00.526 --> 07:01.776
I'm Abed.

07:01.810 --> 07:02.977
Oh, right.

07:03.011 --> 07:05.980
Uh, "Troy,"
could you please excuse us?

07:05.998 --> 07:09.367
You were weird this morning,
and now, well, weirder.

07:09.418 --> 07:10.985
Are we still on
for Senor Kevin's

07:11.003 --> 07:13.087
or are you guys doing
this whole switchy thing?

07:13.122 --> 07:15.122
Actually, he's kind of
going through some stuff.

07:15.140 --> 07:17.976
Oh.
Is he having some issues

07:18.010 --> 07:19.510
that he's having trouble
dealing with?

07:19.562 --> 07:22.664
Yeah, he kind of needs this,
so he's really laying into it.

07:22.698 --> 07:27.035
Oh, so he might need
an almost therapist.

07:27.069 --> 07:29.821
Perhaps I'll pencil him in
for a session,

07:29.872 --> 07:33.541
you know,
after my date with Troy.

07:33.576 --> 07:37.612
See you later, Abed.

07:37.630 --> 07:39.380

07:39.415 --> 07:41.833

07:41.884 --> 07:43.501
- What?
- Hmm?

07:43.552 --> 07:46.621
Dean, I need you to give
this DVD to Troy and Abed.

07:46.639 --> 07:48.089
Oh, I love those movies!

07:48.123 --> 07:50.642
They should make more of them.
They're a timeless tale.

07:50.676 --> 07:52.176
Why can't you give it to them?

07:52.227 --> 07:54.262
Troy and Abed think
they switched bodies

07:54.296 --> 07:56.314
while holding
onto a <i>freaky Friday</i> DVD,

07:56.348 --> 07:59.350
which, of course,
is now mysteriously missing,

07:59.401 --> 08:01.135
and they can't switch back
until they find it.

08:01.153 --> 08:03.404
Now, I'd give them
this one myself,

08:03.439 --> 08:05.857
but they'll think
that I bought it, which I did.

08:05.908 --> 08:08.660
Wait.
How did they switch bodies?

08:08.694 --> 08:11.613
[Scoffs] Well, they held
onto the DVD and said...

08:11.647 --> 08:12.747
Both: I wish I could
switch places with you

08:12.781 --> 08:13.748
for just one day.

08:13.782 --> 08:15.833
Oh! Oh!

Oh...Ah!

08:18.654 --> 08:20.154
Sorry.

08:20.172 --> 08:21.756
That is not a thing!

[Deep, as Jeff]
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

08:27.379 --> 08:28.846
I'm you?

08:28.881 --> 08:31.766
What?
No! You're not.

08:31.800 --> 08:35.053
Of course.
It's fricking Friday.

08:35.104 --> 08:37.270
There's no justification
to be made,

08:37.306 --> 08:39.674
because it can't happen,
weirdo.

08:39.707 --> 08:42.393
Whatever, Dean.
Now, please leave <i>your</i> office

08:42.443 --> 08:44.195
so I can start
to work on <i>your</i> weird body

08:44.229 --> 08:47.315
that I'm now stuck in!

08:47.349 --> 08:49.712
You're not even
holding a phone!

08:52.154 --> 08:54.068
So, Troy...

08:54.401 --> 08:55.840
how's Abed coping?

08:55.960 --> 08:58.448
I mean, with his day in your body?

08:58.483 --> 09:01.201
You'd have to ask him.
I, for one, am freaked.

09:01.235 --> 09:02.418
Look at his arms and legs.

09:02.436 --> 09:04.154
He's like the pick-up sticks
of people.

09:04.188 --> 09:06.690
Do you think he's trying
to hide from something

09:06.724 --> 09:08.058
he's not understanding?

09:08.092 --> 09:10.243
If you're worried about Abed,
you should talk to him.

09:10.278 --> 09:13.129
Right.
I should talk to <i>him.</i>

09:13.147 --> 09:16.733
Well, well, well.
John "Mc-Lame."

09:16.767 --> 09:18.735
Never thought
I'd see your face again.

09:18.769 --> 09:20.036
Back for more, huh?

09:20.071 --> 09:22.372
I'm sorry, back for what?

09:22.406 --> 09:23.590
Punishment.

09:23.624 --> 09:24.808
Last time I saw you,

09:24.842 --> 09:26.359
you got your panties
all in a wad

09:26.410 --> 09:29.446
'cause I said <i>Die Hard</i>
was a suckfest of a movie.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.616
[Forced] Wait, what?
You hate <i>Die Hard?</i>

09:32.650 --> 09:34.701
That sounds insane to me.

09:34.735 --> 09:35.969
It is, without a doubt,

09:36.003 --> 09:38.655
the most unnecessary movie
ever made.

09:38.689 --> 09:41.908
I'm not
who you think I am, man.

09:41.943 --> 09:44.261
What else do you hate
about the movie?

09:44.295 --> 09:47.831
'Cause I would love to hear
all of your opinions.

09:47.865 --> 09:50.784
[Laughing] Well, I mean,
where to even start?

09:50.835 --> 09:52.969
It's riddled with plot holes.
There's no logic to it.

09:53.004 --> 09:57.190
I would rather watch a napkin
sit and do nothing all day

09:57.225 --> 10:01.745
than to even endure the trailer
for <i>Die Hard!</i>

10:01.779 --> 10:04.297
Wow, that's hatred.

10:07.185 --> 10:08.552
Babe, we should order.

10:08.586 --> 10:12.372
I'm both starving and
another word for wanting food.

10:13.758 --> 10:14.958
Troy!

10:14.992 --> 10:16.743
Oh, thank God,
you've come to your senses.

10:16.777 --> 10:18.028
You answered to Troy.

10:18.062 --> 10:19.663
We're in public.
I have to. I'm Abed.

10:19.697 --> 10:21.164
Of course you are.

10:21.199 --> 10:25.218
Well, Abed, I found the DVD.
You can switch back now.

10:25.253 --> 10:27.354
[Chuckles] Nice try.
That's the remake.

10:27.388 --> 10:29.105
In the original, the mom
and daughter simply exclaimed,

10:29.140 --> 10:30.640
"I wish I could switch places
with you for just one day,"

10:30.675 --> 10:31.825
like we did.

10:31.859 --> 10:33.142
In that one,
there's a magic fortune cookie.

10:33.160 --> 10:34.761
Oh, I always wondered
what the differences were.

10:34.795 --> 10:37.998
Listen, why don't I pitch you
a remake of a remake,

10:38.049 --> 10:40.383
where my magic mouth
tells you drop the act

10:40.417 --> 10:41.751
because Abed isn't even here.

10:41.769 --> 10:43.503
Then, you cough up the DVD

10:43.537 --> 10:45.822
and we go tell Abed
you're back in your own bodies,

10:45.856 --> 10:48.608
so we can go do doable
and passable banners.

10:48.643 --> 10:50.193
First, that's a terrible movie.

10:50.211 --> 10:51.544
Second, I understand
why you're frustrated,

10:51.579 --> 10:53.496
it's in your nature,
but this is happening.

10:53.514 --> 10:55.832
This happened.
So, unless we find that DVD--

10:55.850 --> 10:57.267
Oh, no, let's go find this DVD.

10:57.301 --> 10:58.852
By all means,
let's waste more of my life.

10:58.886 --> 10:59.936
Now, we were the last ones

10:59.971 --> 11:01.137
to leave the study room
last night.

11:01.171 --> 11:02.389
Maybe one of the janitors
took it.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.973
Great.
Let's go find that janitor.

11:03.991 --> 11:05.358
Maybe you can
switch bodies with him,

11:05.409 --> 11:06.809
or maybe
with his magic mop--

11:06.827 --> 11:07.994
Stop pitching.
It's not your thing.

11:08.029 --> 11:09.446
You're right,
that's ridiculous,

11:09.480 --> 11:10.697
unlike what we're doing.

11:10.731 --> 11:13.099
[Knocking at the door]

11:13.134 --> 11:14.250
Dean?

11:14.268 --> 11:16.186
Yeah, come in.

11:16.220 --> 11:17.404
I'd stop what I'm doing,

11:17.438 --> 11:20.657
but then I'd be depriving you
of the view.

11:26.380 --> 11:27.881
You're welcome.
What's up?

11:27.915 --> 11:29.966
Um, is this a bad time?

11:29.984 --> 11:32.402
Uh, I'm in Greendale,
stuck in the body

11:32.436 --> 11:33.937
of a man who could be
Gollum's shadow,

11:33.971 --> 11:36.556
so yeah,
I'd say it's half past suck.

11:36.590 --> 11:38.508
[Laughs] Totally.

11:38.542 --> 11:40.844
"Half past suck."
That's funny.

11:40.878 --> 11:42.712
Okay.
That's creepy.

11:42.747 --> 11:44.347
Uh, Dean.

11:44.381 --> 11:46.533
We're losing to Leonard
in the race of Valedictorian,

11:46.567 --> 11:48.151
and we were wondering
if we could take a peek

11:48.185 --> 11:49.869
at his transcripts to see
how that is even possible.

11:49.904 --> 11:52.589
- Are you serious?
- Mm.

11:52.623 --> 11:54.291
You mean put my integrity
on the line?

11:54.325 --> 11:56.092
You want me to jeopardize
the very reputation

11:56.126 --> 11:58.428
of this school that
I've spent so long protecting?

11:58.446 --> 12:00.897
You're right.
We're sorry.

12:00.931 --> 12:03.867
And that is what I would be
saying if I gave a crap.

12:03.901 --> 12:06.286
Awesome!

12:10.057 --> 12:11.908
Ah, here's the answer.

12:11.942 --> 12:15.695
Back in 1968, Leonard got an "A"
in Rotary Phone Maintenance.

12:15.746 --> 12:18.615
Since then, he's been taking
every other class pass/fail

12:18.649 --> 12:20.517
to keep a perfect G.P.A.

12:20.551 --> 12:21.801
Well, what does this mean?

12:21.836 --> 12:24.721
It means we're taking
an old man down.

12:24.755 --> 12:27.357
[Gasps] Ooh.

12:27.391 --> 12:29.159
You're welcome.

12:29.193 --> 12:32.862
- What is wrong with you?
- I don't know.

12:32.897 --> 12:34.581
How's your bean burrito?

12:34.632 --> 12:37.033
Good. Thank you
for ordering for me.

12:37.051 --> 12:38.468
I know what you always get.

12:38.502 --> 12:41.637
- Yeah, you know me so well.
- I know a lot about you.

12:41.655 --> 12:43.189
I know you grind your teeth
at night, it keeps me up.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.058
- I know about your tattoo.
- Which one?

12:45.092 --> 12:46.209
The Greenpeace one
you haven't gotten yet

12:46.243 --> 12:48.912
because you're afraid
of needles.

12:48.946 --> 12:50.847
Did Troy tell you these things?

12:50.881 --> 12:52.248
I am Troy.

12:52.266 --> 12:54.404
Well, it must upset Abed

12:54.524 --> 12:56.886
to hear all of this
relationship talk.

12:56.921 --> 12:59.622
- He doesn't seem to care.
- Maybe.

12:59.657 --> 13:02.675
But maybe he doesn't like
talking to you about us.

13:02.710 --> 13:04.625
I could see that
causing him to act out.

13:04.810 --> 13:06.061
Nah, I don't see that.

13:06.095 --> 13:07.462
I don't think
he's that invested in us.

13:07.496 --> 13:11.166
- But he talks to you about us.
- I talk to him.

13:12.535 --> 13:15.670
What do you say
when you talk to him about us?

13:15.721 --> 13:17.339
Do you tell him
that things are good?

13:17.373 --> 13:20.191
I don't know.
Are they?

13:20.226 --> 13:22.510
- Well, what you think?
- Well,

13:22.545 --> 13:24.980
I guess I wonder why we didn't
remember our anniversary.

13:25.014 --> 13:28.033
- Not everybody's Annie.
- No, but I don't know.

13:28.067 --> 13:30.552
Seems like, you know,
that would be special to us,

13:30.586 --> 13:32.503
like, especially
if things were good.

13:32.521 --> 13:33.805
Something we'd want
to celebrate.

13:33.839 --> 13:35.307
Well, we are.

13:35.341 --> 13:38.326
Are we?

13:39.962 --> 13:41.279
[Laughter]
Yes, Lord Brickell,

13:41.297 --> 13:44.966
I was indeed
down by the stables.

13:45.017 --> 13:47.953
Damn, man.
You ever heard of knocking?

13:47.987 --> 13:50.005
Yup, just heard it,
when I did it a second ago.

13:50.039 --> 13:52.357
They've seen too much!
Let's kill them!

13:52.391 --> 13:53.825
Stand down, crazy Schmidt.

13:53.859 --> 13:56.077
What we're doing here
is none of their business.

13:56.112 --> 13:57.595
We're having murder mystery
night during the day.

13:57.630 --> 13:59.631
I was fine with
"None of your business."

13:59.665 --> 14:01.549
We're looking
for a <i>Freaky Friday</i> DVD.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.219
Oh, I love those movies.
They should make more of those--

14:04.270 --> 14:06.621
Nope. We left it
in study room "F" last night.

14:06.656 --> 14:08.639
Well, everything we find goes
straight to the lost and found.

14:08.658 --> 14:10.075
Great, show us.

14:10.109 --> 14:12.577
And the "Wasting My Life" tour
continues.

14:12.611 --> 14:15.447
Leonard!

14:15.481 --> 14:17.982
We just looked
at your transcript.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.036
I knew this day would come.
I'm outta here.

14:22.672 --> 14:24.856
There you go.
My work here is done.

14:24.890 --> 14:26.391
You're one and two again.

14:26.425 --> 14:29.427
Now, you can direct your anger
and resentment at each other.

14:29.445 --> 14:30.578
Congrats.

14:30.613 --> 14:33.114
- Classic wrap-up.
- Shut up, Leonard!

14:33.165 --> 14:34.783
I've got a picture
of your old nose!

14:34.834 --> 14:36.785
- It was a lateral move!
- Dean!

14:36.836 --> 14:37.786
[Turned on] Dean...

14:37.837 --> 14:40.422
- Annie.
- Why is this happening?

14:43.059 --> 14:45.460
Holy--makes complete sense
at this school!

14:45.494 --> 14:47.762
FYI, one of these piles
is load-bearing,

14:47.797 --> 14:50.231
so, uh, yeah, watch that.

14:50.282 --> 14:52.400
Jeez.

14:52.451 --> 14:55.320
This is gonna be harder
than I thought.

14:55.354 --> 14:56.738
This DVD isn't gonna
find itself.

14:56.789 --> 14:59.891
And neither are we, Troy,
because it's not in here,

14:59.925 --> 15:01.426
and you know that.

15:01.460 --> 15:02.761
This is dumb.

15:02.795 --> 15:04.913
Why are you so committed
to this bit?

15:04.947 --> 15:07.415
If you're really
a friend to Abed, to me,

15:07.450 --> 15:09.084
then you'll end it, now.

15:09.118 --> 15:13.271
Sorry.
I have to keep going, for Troy.

15:13.305 --> 15:15.156
You don't have to dig
through all this stuff. I will.

15:15.207 --> 15:17.942
I know it isn't your problem.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.411
I'm just glad I'm here.

15:19.445 --> 15:21.629
This is the sweeter end
of the deal.

15:21.664 --> 15:25.016
Troy still has to go
on his date with Britta.

15:25.051 --> 15:27.418
I don't understand
this whole relationship thing

15:27.436 --> 15:31.856
or why Troy would even
want to be in one.

15:31.891 --> 15:34.559
How long
have you felt this way?

15:34.593 --> 15:35.860
Or at least,

15:35.895 --> 15:38.730
how long have you
been talking to Abed about this?

15:38.764 --> 15:43.768
Not that long.
It's more lately, I guess.

15:43.786 --> 15:45.236
It's felt different,

15:45.271 --> 15:47.405
like we're working at it
too hard.

15:47.439 --> 15:50.375
And he doesn't think
it should be.

15:50.409 --> 15:53.411
It should be easy,
but he says it isn't.

15:53.445 --> 15:55.363
It feels like we're
just going through the motions.

15:55.397 --> 15:57.715
Because he's afraid
if he doesn't, it just ends.

15:57.750 --> 16:00.952
Then what? What if they're
not friends anymore?

16:00.970 --> 16:04.172
He'd hate that.
He'd hate himself.

16:04.223 --> 16:05.957
I don't want to lose
what we had.

16:05.975 --> 16:09.961
So he's here, at this point,
not knowing how to talk to her,

16:09.995 --> 16:13.131
not knowing how to tell her
that he wants to break up.

16:13.149 --> 16:17.118
Wait, are you
breaking up with me?

16:17.153 --> 16:20.105
I think so?

16:25.193 --> 16:27.181
I'm sorry, Jeff. I shouldn't
have brought you down here.

16:27.301 --> 16:28.721
Into an of this.

16:29.046 --> 16:31.098
Especially for a bit.
I know you don't respect them.

16:31.132 --> 16:33.266
That's true. They're dumb,
and I stand by that,

16:33.300 --> 16:34.835
but committing to them isn't.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.286
I wish I had the courage

16:36.320 --> 16:38.188
to commit to a bit
like you, Abed,

16:38.222 --> 16:40.791
or to a relationship,
like Troy.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.492
Committing is hard,

16:42.527 --> 16:44.628
because we're all scared
of what happens

16:44.662 --> 16:47.330
when we find out we committed
to the wrong thing,

16:47.365 --> 16:50.751
but there's no shame
in what Troy's done.

16:50.785 --> 16:56.022
He put himself out there
and he really tried,

16:56.057 --> 16:58.658
and that proves he cares.

16:58.693 --> 17:01.027
That said,
and as hard as it may seem,

17:01.062 --> 17:05.449
right now,
Troy needs to show he cares.

17:05.500 --> 17:09.586
He needs to put himself
out there and own how he feels.

17:09.637 --> 17:12.722
That proves he's a man.

17:15.175 --> 17:17.977
So...

17:17.994 --> 17:20.714
Yeah, I don't think
this is the way

17:20.748 --> 17:22.549
either of us
thought this would go.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.769
No, I can't say that I did.

17:25.803 --> 17:30.690
I mean, not this, not us here.

17:30.725 --> 17:33.293
[Sighs]

17:33.327 --> 17:36.580
But I can say that
whenever you guys switch back

17:36.631 --> 17:38.799
to your original bodies,
I want to thank Abed

17:38.833 --> 17:42.235
for being such a good friend
to both of us.

17:42.270 --> 17:46.339
Troy, wait.
Don't do it like this.

17:46.374 --> 17:47.841
I understand why
you had to go high concept,

17:47.859 --> 17:51.144
because you're scared,
but Britta deserves better.

17:51.179 --> 17:54.614
Troy, it's time.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.886
Both: I wish
I had my own body back!

17:59.921 --> 18:03.790
[Babbling gibberish]

18:03.808 --> 18:06.960
Sorry,
routine light switch check.

18:06.994 --> 18:09.112
[Babbling continues]

18:13.234 --> 18:15.151
- Oh.
- Hmm.

18:20.407 --> 18:22.676
Oh, I've been meaning
to see this.

18:22.710 --> 18:26.479
First, the easiest part,
because it's the most obvious.

18:26.514 --> 18:28.381
I'm sorry.

18:28.416 --> 18:32.652
I think I proved today
that I'm not ready for this.

18:32.687 --> 18:35.288
I wanted it to work.
I did.

18:35.323 --> 18:36.689
I care about you so much,

18:36.707 --> 18:41.161
and I love being around you.

18:41.195 --> 18:44.564
I just think I'm better
as your friend,

18:44.599 --> 18:48.685
because that I know
I can be good at.

18:51.639 --> 18:54.974
So I'm number two again,
which is what it is.

18:54.992 --> 18:57.661
But you know, if I'm not
going to be Valedictorian,

18:57.695 --> 19:00.196
- I'm glad it will be you.
- Mm, me too.

19:00.231 --> 19:03.416
You mean you hope it's me
if it's not you,

19:03.450 --> 19:04.968
or that you're glad it's you?

19:05.002 --> 19:06.920
Yes.

19:06.954 --> 19:08.755
Thanks for everything
you did for me today.

19:08.789 --> 19:10.106
I'm sorry I pulled you into it.

19:10.141 --> 19:11.892
That was my problem, not yours.

19:11.926 --> 19:14.694
It's the best way someone's
ever woken me up in my life.

19:14.729 --> 19:17.430
How was lunch?

19:17.448 --> 19:19.449
It was good.
It really was.

19:19.483 --> 19:21.134
I'll tell you about it later.

19:21.168 --> 19:22.202
Oh, there you are.

19:22.236 --> 19:23.370
I got bored waiting,

19:23.404 --> 19:25.939
so I went ahead
and did our whole project.

19:25.973 --> 19:28.207
[Chuckles] Pierce, no offense,

19:28.225 --> 19:31.344
but banners are kind of
my specialt--oh.

19:31.378 --> 19:34.881
Holy--makes no sense
whatsoever.

19:34.899 --> 19:38.435
Whole thing
took 25 minutes tops.

19:38.486 --> 19:40.270
All: Huh.

19:40.321 --> 19:42.272
Early weekend?
Early weekend? Early weekend?

19:42.323 --> 19:45.525
Guys, I need to apologize
for my behavior today.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.277
When I switched bodies
with Jeffrey...

19:47.328 --> 19:48.662
- Nope.
- I thought I knew

19:48.696 --> 19:50.330
what it would be like
to have Jeffrey inside of me...

19:50.364 --> 19:52.699
- That did not happen.
- But as it turns out,

19:52.733 --> 19:55.168
- having Jeffrey inside of me...
- Nope again.

19:55.202 --> 19:56.836
...only brought out
the worst in me.

19:56.871 --> 20:00.073
Which is to say,
having Jeffrey inside of me...

20:00.091 --> 20:01.625
No one was inside of anyone!

20:01.676 --> 20:03.843
...was wrong...

20:03.878 --> 20:06.546
- to have Jeffrey inside of me.
- Shut up!

20:06.580 --> 20:08.181
So I'm sorry.

20:08.215 --> 20:09.799
Now, if you'll excuse me,

20:09.850 --> 20:11.685
I scolded Leonard today,

20:11.719 --> 20:14.087
and according
to Greendale bylaws,

20:14.105 --> 20:17.190
I now have to grant him
three wishes.

20:17.224 --> 20:20.477
Um, we need to get scolded
by the Dean immediately.

20:20.528 --> 20:23.446
Mm-hmm.

20:25.000 --> 20:31.074

20:36.415 --> 20:39.464
Oh, man. Football is fun.
That is an interest I have.

20:39.584 --> 20:42.914
Also plumbing and air conditioning
are things I think about.

20:44.589 --> 20:46.259
Come on, what are we...
what's happening?

20:46.379 --> 20:49.069
- I'm sorry, keep rolling.
- Okay, come on.

20:49.692 --> 20:51.667
- Feetball's...feetball?
- Feetball?

20:51.787 --> 20:52.821
- Did I say...
- Dorks!

20:52.941 --> 20:55.074
Stop doing outtakes.
You switched your bodies last week.

20:55.867 --> 20:58.079
Guys, I just wanna apologize...

20:59.794 --> 21:02.387
Oh my God.
Hey, Dean, walk much, am I right?

21:02.507 --> 21:04.538
I'm sorry,
I never do this.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.411
Dean, we stopped playing outtakes.

21:06.531 --> 21:07.402
Oh, okay.

21:07.522 --> 21:08.406
Yeah, we did that.

21:08.526 --> 21:10.565
Oh, no worries.
Thanks for including me.

21:11.751 --> 21:14.981
Ohhh!
No, still not doing it.
