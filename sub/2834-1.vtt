00:58.025 --> 01:00.369
I wanna come home, Claire.
Let me come home.

01:01.194 --> 01:02.502
Please.
Just get out.

01:03.163 --> 01:04.540
Get out!

01:09.670 --> 01:11.877
Don't tell me Dad's not coming back.
Don't tell me that.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.610
Kevin, wait. Kevin?

01:24.284 --> 01:25.285
Claire.

01:25.385 --> 01:27.058
I love you like a sister,
but you have got to

01:27.120 --> 01:28.622
get those divorce
papers signed

01:28.722 --> 01:30.030
and move on.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.862
It's been nine months.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.530
What? Are you having
second thoughts?

01:35.128 --> 01:36.471
I'm having dinner.

01:36.563 --> 01:37.906
With Garrett?

01:38.031 --> 01:39.977
oh, you pussy!

01:40.067 --> 01:41.705
It's for Kevin's birthday.

01:41.768 --> 01:45.215
Honestly, Vicky, sometimes I
think you're rooting against us.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.307
Who's "us"?

01:46.406 --> 01:47.783
You and me,
or you and him,

01:47.874 --> 01:49.114
because I kinda
thought that was done.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.555
He's the father of my kid.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.421
Who cheats
with the secretary

01:53.480 --> 01:55.551
every time he goes
to the home office.

01:55.782 --> 01:56.954
Brings a whole new meaning

01:57.050 --> 01:58.290
to "the San Francisco Treat."

01:58.385 --> 01:59.420
Not funny.

01:59.553 --> 02:02.329
He said she smelt like chocolate
chip cookies.

02:02.422 --> 02:04.265
Goodbye. I'm just
quoting his email.

02:04.324 --> 02:07.305
You don't have to! Okay?

02:08.294 --> 02:11.139
Because it's
burned in my mind.

02:11.231 --> 02:12.574
Forever.

02:16.336 --> 02:19.977
And for your information, he doesn't
go to San Francisco anymore.

02:21.241 --> 02:24.779
So, stop bringing it up.
It's not fair.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.586
Ta-da!
Make a wish.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.785
Happy birthday!

02:28.582 --> 02:30.653
You made that?
Of course!

02:30.751 --> 02:32.355
Come on. I've been
waiting all day.

02:32.452 --> 02:33.760
I want you to see this.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.525
Okay.
I'll help you.

02:36.623 --> 02:38.000
One, two, three!

02:38.258 --> 02:39.965
Ta-da!

02:40.027 --> 02:42.769
Oh' my G“! Dam
Huh?

02:42.829 --> 02:44.035
It's like a high-powered

02:44.131 --> 02:46.634
gaming tower
with an arctic cooler.

02:46.700 --> 02:47.701
And you made this?

02:47.801 --> 02:49.940
Three weekends in a row.
Triple processor.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.176
Dad, thank you so much.

02:52.272 --> 02:53.945
Let's do cake.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.149
What are you guys
doing for Labor Day?

02:58.211 --> 02:59.781
I don't know. Why?

02:59.846 --> 03:01.689
I thought we'd go camping
like the old days.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.022
Mom, too? Yeah, of course.
That's what I was thinking.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.824
Oh, it will be a lot of fun.
We could catch fish,

03:05.886 --> 03:07.126
and, Mom,
you could cook it.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.530
Yeah, that sounds
like a lot of fun.

03:08.622 --> 03:09.965
Please?

03:10.023 --> 03:12.367
Look at you, you got schmutz everywhere.
Go clean up.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.735
Okay. All right,
be rig ht back.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.466
Come on, what do you say?

03:16.697 --> 03:17.835
Um...

03:19.332 --> 03:20.834
When were you
thinking of going?

03:21.068 --> 03:22.570
I get back from
a business trip

03:22.669 --> 03:24.148
the Thursday
before Labor Day.

03:24.471 --> 03:25.814
Business trip?

03:25.872 --> 03:27.317
Yep. Get back
Thursday night,

03:27.374 --> 03:28.512
we'll leave, three days.

03:28.575 --> 03:29.645
Where?

03:29.810 --> 03:32.814
That old cabin we used to
go to at Mammoth Lakes.

03:32.879 --> 03:33.880
That sounds great!

03:35.082 --> 03:38.188
No, I meant where
is your business trip?

03:39.686 --> 03:42.326
Let me guess. San Francisco?

03:42.823 --> 03:44.393
It's work.
It's not what you think.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.030
Does she still work there?

03:46.193 --> 03:47.695
Claire, it doesn't matter.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.502
No, I guess
it doesn't matter.

03:50.697 --> 03:51.903
Mom?
Yeah?

03:51.998 --> 03:53.409
So, you coming or not?

03:53.500 --> 03:54.672
Mmm. You know what?

03:54.735 --> 03:57.181
That's the weekend
before school starts.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.775
So, you know, you guys should
just keep it a guy trip.

04:00.874 --> 04:03.252
You'll have a blast.

04:03.343 --> 04:04.788
Okay
Okay

04:33.373 --> 04:36.377
Kevin!
Honey, we gotta go.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.321
Kevin!

04:39.412 --> 04:40.755
I know.

04:42.549 --> 04:44.893
Mom, the door is jammed.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.589
Mom, look,
can we just forget it?

04:46.653 --> 04:48.929
Because I don't wanna
see another doctor, okay?

04:48.989 --> 04:50.662
He's not gonna tell you
anything any different.

04:50.757 --> 04:53.067
He is the best allergist
in the Valley, okay?

04:53.126 --> 04:54.298
We're going.
You know what?

04:54.961 --> 04:56.497
I'll lift the door,
you pull the cord.

04:56.596 --> 04:59.577
Okay. Okay.

05:01.568 --> 05:02.672
Okay, you ready, Mom?

05:03.603 --> 05:05.742
Just pull it up! It's too heavy.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.285
It's too heavy.
Pull it up, baby.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.013
I got n.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.521
I can fix that
for you if you want.

05:13.513 --> 05:15.151
And you are?

05:15.248 --> 05:17.091
My nephew.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.788
Oh, hey, Mr. Sandborn.

05:18.852 --> 05:21.833
Noah. I'm staying
next door with my uncle.

05:21.922 --> 05:22.992
Claire.

05:23.089 --> 05:24.659
He's hereto help me

05:24.758 --> 05:27.329
when I get the, uh'
bone marrow transport.

05:27.427 --> 05:28.462
Right.

05:28.595 --> 05:30.472
"Transplant," Uncle Bob.
"Transplant."

05:30.530 --> 05:31.668
Oh, yeah.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.109
He's got a real knack
for fixing things.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.169
I can, uh, lake a
look at this real quick.

05:36.603 --> 05:37.946
Hey, how you doing?
I'm Noah.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.642
Kevin. Yeah. Um...

05:40.140 --> 05:41.278
I don't know
what the issue is.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.116
It might be
off the track, but...

05:43.176 --> 05:45.019
Nah. Actually,
it's the clutch.

05:45.111 --> 05:47.352
We can get another one at the
hardware store if you want.

05:47.447 --> 05:48.619
You wanna go? Come on.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.663
Well, you know, we actually
had somewhere to be,

05:51.718 --> 05:54.028
but now that
we're gonna be late...

05:54.120 --> 05:55.121
Mom?

05:57.023 --> 05:58.331
Okay

05:58.391 --> 05:59.893
Go ahead.
Cool.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.166
All right. It was nice meeting you.
You, too.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.230
Uncle Bob'?
Are you gonna be okay?

06:03.330 --> 06:04.707
Yeah, sure, I'm fine.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.141
Look at me.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.577
Hey. Love you.
MR. SANDBORN: Love you, too.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.804
His parents died last year.

06:11.504 --> 06:14.314
I'm all he's got now
in the way of family.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.812
He seems like a nice boy.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.322
Yeah, he is.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.881
You up for some coffee?

06:20.981 --> 06:22.756
Yeah, sure. Sure.
Come on.

06:23.149 --> 06:25.652
So, the entire time,
it was the clutch.

06:25.719 --> 06:26.823
Mm-hmm.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.999
How old are you,
anyway?

06:29.055 --> 06:30.659
Almost 20.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.896
But you're not
from around here.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.097
No. San Bernardino.

06:34.194 --> 06:37.107
My uncle, actually,
my great-uncle, uh,

06:37.197 --> 06:39.006
he needed help,
I needed a change,

06:39.065 --> 06:41.443
so I figured I'd go
back to school here.

06:41.534 --> 06:42.945
You mean college?

06:43.169 --> 06:45.376
There was this, uh...

06:45.438 --> 06:46.678
Accident.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.515
So, I lost some time.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.248
So, I'm gonna finish up
at Monroe High.

06:50.510 --> 06:53.423
That's where I go. My mom
teaches there, actually.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.690
She seems way too cool
to be a teacher.

06:56.783 --> 06:57.784
She is cool.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.123
For a mom.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.930
Okay. We got everything.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.764
Good to go?
Yeah, let's go.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.235
Okay

07:06.293 --> 07:07.636
Here you go, sir.
Thank you.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.230
Whoa.

07:10.463 --> 07:12.534
Can you, uh, pay for this?

07:13.266 --> 07:14.540
What?
Uh...

07:14.601 --> 07:16.444
Look,
that's Allie Callahan, okay?

07:16.536 --> 07:18.482
She's the most
beautiful girl in school

07:18.571 --> 07:20.983
and I just can't think when I'm around her.
So, just, can you...

07:21.074 --> 07:22.553
I don't know.
I hate to tell you this,

07:22.609 --> 07:24.213
but she's already seen you.

07:24.311 --> 07:25.483
Just go on
and talk to her.

07:25.612 --> 07:26.613
And say what?

07:27.047 --> 07:30.119
Just tell her,

07:30.216 --> 07:32.628
"Here are some garage parts.
How much?"

07:32.719 --> 07:34.630
Go!
Wow. Very funny. Yeah.

07:34.721 --> 07:35.825
Come on.
Thank you.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.164
You want me to fail.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.228
Hi.
Hi, Kevin.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.798
Hi, Allie. Um, I didn't
know you worked here.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.668
My dad's making
my brother and me

07:46.766 --> 07:49.076
do split shifts
to earn gas money.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.512
It could be worse.

07:50.603 --> 07:52.583
If you didn't have a brother,
you'd be working full time.

07:52.639 --> 07:53.913
Noah Sandborn.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.817
Allie. Nice to meet you.

07:55.909 --> 07:56.979
Nice to meet you, too.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.488
I'm friends
with Kevin here.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.255
I'm gonna go look around.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.519
Okay, sure.

08:03.249 --> 08:04.523
So, you're having
a good day?

08:04.617 --> 08:05.755
Yeah.
Great.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.492
How about you?
Actually...

08:11.091 --> 08:12.764
Hey, check it out.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.431
LOOK who it is! Whiz!

08:15.528 --> 08:16.666
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:16.763 --> 08:17.833
Okay, okay!

08:17.931 --> 08:20.002
Jason! Guys!
FORREST: Did you pee-pee?

08:20.100 --> 08:21.636
Oh, what is this, huh? Come on.

08:21.701 --> 08:22.941
Is this your EpiPen?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.539
Your little
penis purse?

08:24.637 --> 08:27.117
You guys, stop it!
Get out of the store!

08:27.207 --> 08:29.016
The kid still pisses the bed.
All three of you, get out!

08:29.109 --> 08:31.487
Okay, all right,
fine, fine.

08:31.611 --> 08:34.455
See you later, Whizzy. Stay away
from liquids. 

08:35.715 --> 08:37.490
Hey, Noah,
are you ready to go?

08:38.551 --> 08:40.861
Uh, Allie, how much
is this gonna be?

08:40.953 --> 08:42.831
I'll ring n up.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.728
Clutch is in.
We're all good.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.236
You thirsty?

08:48.128 --> 08:49.368
Yeah.

08:49.462 --> 08:52.238
Thanks for fixing the door.
And for including him.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.570
Hey, there was this kid
at the hardware store

08:55.668 --> 08:57.204
giving him a hard time.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.847
Jason Zimmer?

09:00.340 --> 09:02.377
Um, skater kid, red hair,

09:02.475 --> 09:03.647
permanently dumb look
on his face?

09:04.477 --> 09:07.321
That would be the one. Kept
on calling him "The Whiz.“

09:11.985 --> 09:13.362
He actually had an incident

09:13.420 --> 09:15.058
a couple of years ago
on a playground

09:15.155 --> 09:18.568
where he got stung by a bee,
and his throat swelled up

09:18.658 --> 09:21.229
and he panicked

09:21.995 --> 09:23.338
and lost control.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.875
Whiz.
Whiz.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.369
on, man.

09:26.499 --> 09:29.673
Kids can be cruel. Especially
kids like Jason Zimmer.

09:30.503 --> 09:33.347
But, please,
don't tell him I told you.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.510
He'd be mortified.

09:35.341 --> 09:37.218
You can trust me.

09:39.846 --> 09:42.588
Anyways, uh, you're all set.

09:43.783 --> 09:47.754
This is very exciting. Very
exciting moment.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.870
It works!

09:55.361 --> 09:56.601
Thank you.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.809
I'm gonna take off
this cover real quick.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.911
Put it over there.
On the ground?

10:45.078 --> 10:46.682
Uh, wherever. Just set
it down, doesn't matter.

10:46.813 --> 10:47.814
Set it down'?
Yeah.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.518
All right, now this
bad boy right here

10:49.616 --> 10:51.186
is the alternator.
You know what this does?

10:51.284 --> 10:53.093
No.
It charges the battery.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.632
So, I'm gonna
do one piece of it,

10:54.754 --> 10:56.427
you're gonna do the other, all right?
All right.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.025
All right?
Yeah.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.669
You're actually
going the opposite way.

11:01.761 --> 11:02.762
Yeah.

11:02.829 --> 11:03.967
All right, we're gonna
check out the alternator.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.476
You're loosening it up
rather than tightening it.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.313
How's that?

11:10.603 --> 11:12.640
It's in there. You wanna
finish it off, Noah?

11:12.705 --> 11:14.207
I'll just do it in there.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.681
Okay.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.883
Yeah, this one
needs two...

11:23.283 --> 11:24.853
Make sure it's
actually in there.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.453
To the right?

11:49.809 --> 11:52.881
Okay,
I'm changing the subject.

11:53.146 --> 11:56.059
Um, how long will your
uncle be in the hospital?

11:56.149 --> 11:57.651
Um, I don't know.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.259
It's all about
the transplant taking.

12:01.487 --> 12:03.558
Well, until he's better, you
can come over for dinner here

12:03.656 --> 12:04.999
anytime, okay?

12:05.058 --> 12:06.765
I don't want you eating
by yourself. I mean it.

12:06.859 --> 12:08.770
Thanks, but I don't
wanna impose.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.675
Oh, I do. Especially if
she's making the guacamole.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.404
You are not an imposition.

12:13.499 --> 12:14.910
Are you saying I am?
Mmm.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.537
Well, in that case,
l wouldn't mind

12:16.603 --> 12:17.843
imposing on your
literature class.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.085
Oh, no, dude,
you don't wanna do that.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.414
They call her
"The Crusher."

12:22.508 --> 12:23.714
Is that what they call me?

12:23.776 --> 12:24.777
Yes.
Yeah.

12:24.844 --> 12:26.221
You know what? Carry your own plate.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.518
Clean up all the dishes.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.386
Now he's really
worried about it.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.626
Strange kid.

12:34.721 --> 12:35.927
Why?

12:36.689 --> 12:38.032
Can't put my finger on it.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.430
Don't try so hard.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.204
Okay. He's interested
in literature?

12:45.231 --> 12:46.938
In the classics.

12:47.033 --> 12:49.536
Back in San Bernardino,
we were studying the Odyssey.

12:49.869 --> 12:51.712
You want me to help
you outwith that?

12:51.771 --> 12:53.944
Sure. Here you go.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.781
You know, I'm teaching
Homer next semester.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.149
Really? He's my favorite.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.480
You're kidding, right?

12:58.578 --> 13:00.216
Second that.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.123
Dude, you gotta
read the Iliad.

13:02.248 --> 13:04.592
Achilles is this
total badass.

13:04.717 --> 13:05.957
Hot-tempered, full of pride,

13:06.052 --> 13:08.089
completely consumed
by his emotions.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.426
You know what he
called Agamemnon?

13:09.489 --> 13:10.593
Who?

13:10.890 --> 13:13.166
"A pitiful excuse
for a king."

13:13.960 --> 13:15.906
To his face.

13:16.162 --> 13:17.573
He killed this guy, Hector.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.938
But instead of hiding out
like a pussy, he...

13:18.998 --> 13:21.239
Dragged his dead body around
for everybody to see.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.747
Yes! He stood by his
actions, right or wrong.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.579
Well, because to him
they were justified.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.243
Do you have any idea
what they're talking about?

13:28.308 --> 13:30.015
No.
No.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.123
Homer's a genius,
my man.

13:35.181 --> 13:39.254
Just like Shakespeare,
Byron, Zeppelin, Dylan.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.489
Ugh.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.130
Poets.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.124
Poets.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.967
Poets.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.281
I'll have him
back Sunday afternoon!

14:00.340 --> 14:02.149
Bye, Mom, I love you!

14:23.963 --> 14:25.704
Oh, hey, Noah,
come on in.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.368
You know,
Kevin already left.

14:27.467 --> 14:30.710
Actually, I, uh, picked
something up for you.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.551
Oh, my God,
this is a first edition?

14:39.645 --> 14:42.182
I can't accept this, this
must have cost a fortune!

14:42.248 --> 14:45.058
It was a buck at a garage sale.
One man's trash.“

14:47.687 --> 14:49.394
Noah, I can't.
Honestly...

14:49.489 --> 14:50.490
Claire, please!

14:50.556 --> 14:52.194
I've been eating here
every single night.

14:52.258 --> 14:53.669
It would mean a lot to me.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.503
Thank you.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.447
Those yours?
Oh, no.

15:05.671 --> 15:07.708
They were a gift
from Vicky.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.542
Why?

15:09.675 --> 15:13.248
Those kind of shoes are for
women trying to be sexy.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.522
You don't need to try.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.222
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have, uh...

15:21.587 --> 15:23.624
No. No, it's okay.

16:50.776 --> 16:51.846
Where are you?

16:51.944 --> 16:53.184
Almost there.

16:53.279 --> 16:54.519
Well, hurry up!

16:54.614 --> 16:55.684
Vicky, I can't do this!

16:55.781 --> 16:57.158
I haven't had a date
in 18 years,

16:57.216 --> 16:59.162
I don't even know
what to do anymore!

16:59.318 --> 17:01.730
Three things.
One, laugh a lot.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.892
Two, take off
your wedding ring.

17:03.990 --> 17:05.867
Three, give him head.
What?

17:05.958 --> 17:08.336
Kidding!
Just get here, pronto!

17:12.665 --> 17:14.201
And the closer
I get to this car,

17:14.300 --> 17:16.803
the smell is getting stronger
and stronger.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.074
And I walk up to
the guy's window,

17:19.171 --> 17:20.548
rolls down the window,

17:20.640 --> 17:23.211
I look and on
the passenger seat is

17:23.643 --> 17:24.678
his dead dog!

17:24.977 --> 17:26.319
You did not tell me that.

17:27.346 --> 17:29.724
So, Ethan tells me you teach.

17:29.815 --> 17:30.885
English, is it?

17:30.983 --> 17:33.224
The classics.
Wow.

17:33.719 --> 17:34.925
What does that mean?

17:36.022 --> 17:37.558
Oh. No, he just
means as a compliment,

17:37.657 --> 17:39.568
like, "Wow, you teach
the classics."

17:42.028 --> 17:43.098
It's fancy.

17:43.195 --> 17:45.197
I mean, I don't know

17:45.264 --> 17:46.709
how many kids nowadays
are going to use

17:46.766 --> 17:49.110
what they learn
from classics.

17:50.202 --> 17:51.681
No offense.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.047
Oh, none taken.
lam a vice principal

17:54.106 --> 17:56.017
and I just want to see
these kids employed.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.247
Shall we order?

17:57.777 --> 17:59.757
Silly me,
I just want them educated.

18:00.112 --> 18:01.523
I'm fine with education,

18:01.581 --> 18:03.458
but we gotta
get them working.

18:03.549 --> 18:06.792
Practical skills.
That's where the money is.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.526
Ah! Money!
That's the goal, then.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.202
Oh. Ethan,
how's your mom?

18:12.525 --> 18:13.595
Gallstones.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.536
Oh, gallstones.
Mm-hmm.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.597
Are those the ones you pass'?
Or are those the other stones?

18:17.697 --> 18:18.903
Yeah,
she's getting better.

18:18.965 --> 18:22.037
You know, money's fine, except
when it's motivated by greed.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.448
You're a little firecracker when
you get riled up, aren't you?

18:26.539 --> 18:27.745
I think it stopped raining.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.218
Firecracker?

18:29.275 --> 18:31.585
Is that how you regard
women with an opinion?

18:31.711 --> 18:34.214
Only when they
disagree with mine.

18:40.219 --> 18:41.960
Pleasure to meet you, Benny.

18:42.054 --> 18:43.727
No, Claire,
stay, stay!

18:48.127 --> 18:49.663
J. K. Rowling.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.067
I'm sorry?

18:51.130 --> 18:52.302
Billionaire.

18:52.398 --> 18:53.934
Classics major.

18:56.268 --> 18:57.975
She's a lot of laughs.

18:59.238 --> 19:01.240
You gotta get to know her.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.368
Hello?
Question.

20:02.468 --> 20:06.746
I tried to defrost
a chicken in the microwave.

20:06.839 --> 20:09.581
And some of it's
kind of cooked,

20:09.675 --> 20:11.382
some of it's kind of not.

20:11.477 --> 20:12.581
Do you think
it's still cool to

20:12.678 --> 20:14.351
eat the cooked part?

20:14.413 --> 20:17.019
No! Do not eat that!

20:17.083 --> 20:19.893
Then, please, come over
and bail me out. Um...

20:20.586 --> 20:21.929
Um... Uh...

20:22.421 --> 20:24.059
Okay.

20:24.156 --> 20:25.897
Perfect. Okay.

20:25.991 --> 20:27.197
Yes.

20:27.359 --> 20:28.429
See you soon.

20:28.527 --> 20:30.097
Okay

20:38.537 --> 20:40.676
I mean,
that date was awful.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.383
Like that chicken.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.580
I'm sorry I couldn't salvage
it more, but... You did fine.

20:45.678 --> 20:46.782
The damage was done.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.860
Yeah. I'm glad
I had you next door.

20:53.853 --> 20:54.923
What?

20:57.189 --> 21:00.363
God, you're beautiful.
You know that?

21:00.960 --> 21:02.303
Oh, no, I'm...

21:02.394 --> 21:04.203
Amazing.

21:05.030 --> 21:08.307
And sweet,
natural and sexy.

21:11.403 --> 21:12.882
So sexy.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.417
Noah!

21:14.874 --> 21:16.285
Kiss me, Claire.
Just...

21:16.375 --> 21:18.377
I can't.
Just once.

21:19.478 --> 21:20.821
Please.
I have to go.

21:21.080 --> 21:24.061
Tonight, in the window...

21:25.217 --> 21:26.719
You were watching me.

21:28.554 --> 21:30.056
I can't do this!

21:31.423 --> 21:32.629
Noah!

21:32.725 --> 21:34.295
I want to watch you now.

21:34.393 --> 21:37.237
This can't happen.
We can't.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.570
It's wrong!

21:42.401 --> 21:45.746
It doesn't feel wrong,
does it?

21:53.913 --> 21:55.324
Wait.
It feels so...

21:55.414 --> 21:57.257
Oh, my God, stop.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.590
...nice.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.097
Soft.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.763
Please, please stop.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.174
Noah, please!

22:17.670 --> 22:18.944
Stop.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.351
No judgments.

22:26.545 --> 22:27.956
No rules.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.355
Justus.

22:32.451 --> 22:33.953
Oh, my God.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.226
A woman like you

22:36.322 --> 22:38.029
should be cherished.

22:38.324 --> 22:39.803
Loved.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.209
Let me love you, Claire.

23:39.551 --> 23:41.861
You are perfect

23:42.521 --> 23:44.558
in every way.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.839
oh, my God!

25:10.843 --> 25:13.016
Hey! Where are you going?

25:13.312 --> 25:14.620
Home.

25:15.381 --> 25:16.382
I gotta get home.

25:16.482 --> 25:17.620
No, you don't.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.959
Kevin doesn't get home till later.
Have some coffee.

25:20.119 --> 25:21.154
I can't. This...

25:21.220 --> 25:22.528
Was incredible.

25:26.291 --> 25:29.363
Hey, you're having second
thoughts, it's normal.

25:29.461 --> 25:31.031
This isn't normal, okay?

25:31.130 --> 25:33.542
Nothing about this
is normal.

25:33.632 --> 25:35.009
Where's my coat?

25:36.535 --> 25:38.208
Would you just stop
for one minute'?

25:38.303 --> 25:40.408
Look, Noah,
I don't want you to think

25:40.506 --> 25:42.144
that any of this
was your fault, okay?

25:42.207 --> 25:43.880
I'm the adult, I'm the one
that should've known...

25:43.976 --> 25:47.219
Stop, stop! Just stop!

25:47.312 --> 25:48.882
What we did wasn't wrong.
No matter what you say,

25:48.981 --> 25:50.153
it wasn't wrong!

25:50.215 --> 25:51.990
I wasn't thinking
clearly, okay?

25:52.051 --> 25:54.759
I got swept up in the moment.
I was vulnerable

25:54.853 --> 25:57.993
and you're very sweet.
No.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.333
And it was flattering, but I...
No.

26:00.759 --> 26:02.568
It was more than that.

26:08.167 --> 26:09.510
God damn it!

26:16.175 --> 26:17.848
Noah, look,

26:17.943 --> 26:19.547
it wasn't more
than that, okay.

26:19.611 --> 26:21.090
I was feeling vulnerable.

26:21.180 --> 26:24.389
How can you say that?
Last night was so perfect.

26:24.450 --> 26:26.452
Because it's true.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.360
And in time, you're
going to see it, too.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.137
Just leave.

26:36.895 --> 26:38.374
Go! A's You okay?

27:02.988 --> 27:04.490
Mom, we caught seven trout.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.736
Wow!

27:07.092 --> 27:10.301
Yeah, he was, uh,
pretty amazing.

27:10.395 --> 27:12.136
Uh, Mom, can Dad
stay for dinner?

27:13.499 --> 27:14.910
Um...
Please?

27:14.967 --> 27:16.446
Dad?

27:19.404 --> 27:21.406
Please?
Sure.

27:25.577 --> 27:26.817
I saw this video
on YouTube,

27:26.912 --> 27:28.983
where this, just like, big,
you know, mountain dude

27:29.081 --> 27:31.652
who lives all alone in
this old shack in Montana.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.252
And he cooks all
his food on a shovel.

27:33.785 --> 27:35.787
No, you didn't.
We did.

27:35.854 --> 27:38.300
I mean, we wrap it up
in tinfoil first...

27:38.357 --> 27:39.768
And eat off the shovel?

27:39.825 --> 27:41.771
Yeah, well, the
foil-covered shovel.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.670
It was a great meal.
It was delicious.

27:43.762 --> 27:45.673
Yeah, it was, like, one of the
best meals I've ever had.

27:45.931 --> 27:47.001
Oh! Thank you!

27:47.099 --> 27:48.169
No. No offense, Mom.

27:48.267 --> 27:51.441
You know what I mean.
I don't mean it like that.

27:51.603 --> 27:53.446
This was great.

27:55.274 --> 27:56.878
What do you
think she made?

27:56.975 --> 27:58.215
I bet you it's cookies.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.827
I'll get ii.

28:13.892 --> 28:15.064
You want any coffee?

28:15.160 --> 28:16.639
Yeah,
I'll have some if you are!

28:18.130 --> 28:19.803
Noah! What's up?

28:19.865 --> 28:20.866
Hey, man,
you're back.

28:20.966 --> 28:22.172
How was the trip?

28:22.234 --> 28:24.544
Hey, Dad,
this is, uh, Noah.

28:24.636 --> 28:25.979
Remember, I've been
talking about him a lot?

28:26.038 --> 28:27.346
Hey, nice to meet you!

28:27.406 --> 28:29.716
I feel like I know you,
he talks about you so much.

28:29.808 --> 28:32.880
Told me about the alternator
you put in the truck.

28:32.978 --> 28:35.254
Oh, actually,
Kevin helped out, too, so...

28:35.347 --> 28:36.553
Yeah?
Yeah, I did.

28:36.648 --> 28:37.683
Yeah. It was so cool.

28:37.749 --> 28:39.023
I had no idea
you could do that yourself.

28:39.084 --> 28:40.154
That's what
friends are for.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.220
Hey, Mrs. Peterson.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.492
Hey, Noah.

28:42.554 --> 28:43.589
Wow, looks perfect.

28:43.689 --> 28:45.100
You tell them what
happened this weekend?

28:45.190 --> 28:47.261
What happened?

28:47.359 --> 28:49.339
Oh, there was a big
thunderstorm up here.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.839
You guys didn't
get it up there?

28:50.896 --> 28:52.876
No, beautiful,
dry as a bone at the lake.

28:52.931 --> 28:55.002
Well, it got
pretty wet here.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.101
Wow.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.706
You know what, big day tomorrow.
First day of school.

28:59.771 --> 29:00.943
It's getting kind of late.

29:01.039 --> 29:02.109
But it's, like, 8:30.

29:02.207 --> 29:04.847
No, no, no. Actually, I gotta get going.
It's a big day tomorrow.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.920
I'll walk outwith you,
Mr. Peterson.

29:07.012 --> 29:08.719
Oh, I'm going to stay
around awhile, thanks.

29:08.780 --> 29:10.225
Well, you know, I'll
walk out with you, Noah.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.293
Yeah, come on.

29:12.384 --> 29:14.261
Uh, do you want to take
a cookie for the road?

29:14.353 --> 29:15.696
I love your
mother's cookies.

29:15.754 --> 29:16.755
They're great, right?

29:17.256 --> 29:19.236
Nice to meet you.
Yeah. You, too, pal.

29:23.295 --> 29:24.535
Nice kid.

29:32.070 --> 29:33.447
You know, we need
to figure out

29:33.538 --> 29:35.643
what we're doing here, Garrett.

29:35.741 --> 29:37.049
What do you mean?

29:39.044 --> 29:42.116
I mean, we're in limbo here

29:42.214 --> 29:45.559
and maybe, you know,
it's just time to move on.

29:45.617 --> 29:46.994
I'm not seeing her
anymore.

29:47.085 --> 29:49.622
But you might as well be, because
I'm always going to think you are

29:49.721 --> 29:51.166
and I don't want
to live that way.

29:51.256 --> 29:53.099
And you shouldn't want
to live that way, either.

29:53.158 --> 29:55.798
Hey, it wasn't about her.
It was about us.

29:56.595 --> 29:58.734
Okay? We were broken.

29:59.398 --> 30:01.400
We both checked out.

30:01.733 --> 30:03.770
I'm not saying what I did
was right, it wasn't.

30:03.835 --> 30:05.143
It was...

30:05.237 --> 30:07.148
It was stupid.

30:07.673 --> 30:10.176
Smart people do dumb things.
They make mistakes.

30:11.076 --> 30:13.283
Haven't you ever
made a mistake?

30:14.579 --> 30:15.649
Don't throw
our marriage away

30:15.747 --> 30:17.192
because I made a mistake.

30:18.684 --> 30:20.527
Don't file. Not yet.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.496
Just take...
Take some time.

30:32.097 --> 30:33.940
All right.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.003
Come on.

31:01.993 --> 31:04.200
Welcome, everybody,

31:04.296 --> 31:05.969
to the start of
a brand-new year.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.701
This year,
we are studying

31:08.800 --> 31:11.713
Homer's Iliad
and its themes.

31:11.903 --> 31:14.907
The first one we'll be studying
is the wrath of Achilles.

31:15.907 --> 31:16.908
Mrs. Peterson.

31:17.309 --> 31:20.415
Principal Warren,
what a nice surprise.

31:20.512 --> 31:22.014
Good news.
I've approved your request

31:22.080 --> 31:23.991
for Noah Sandborn
to join your class.

31:27.152 --> 31:31.396
"No man or woman born,
coward or brave,

31:31.690 --> 31:33.601
"can shun his destiny!"

31:35.060 --> 31:38.007
I think it was Achilles
who said that, right?

31:41.366 --> 31:42.674
Wait!

31:43.568 --> 31:45.013
Ed?

31:45.203 --> 31:46.580
Wait!

31:46.671 --> 31:48.241
Wait a second.

31:48.607 --> 31:50.883
This is a class
for AP juniors,

31:50.942 --> 31:53.183
Noah Sandborn
is a transfer senior, so...

31:53.445 --> 31:55.516
I'm confused.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.457
Your transfer request
said, yeah,

31:57.549 --> 31:59.392
that he'd be an asset
to the class.

32:03.789 --> 32:05.769
This was your email.

32:06.024 --> 32:08.129
That's right. Thank you.

32:08.226 --> 32:10.604
Have a great year.

32:41.460 --> 32:42.461
Hey!

32:42.828 --> 32:44.569
Stop following me!

32:44.629 --> 32:46.631
I'm not following you, Claire.

32:46.731 --> 32:47.937
I live next door.

33:04.749 --> 33:05.989
Kevin!

33:06.084 --> 33:07.358
Yeah?

33:07.452 --> 33:09.591
Did you send an email
from my account

33:09.654 --> 33:10.997
to Principal Warren?

33:12.190 --> 33:13.601
No, why?

33:15.293 --> 33:16.465
Because somebody did.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.978
It sounds like
you've been hacked.

33:22.100 --> 33:23.773
You should really
change your password.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.781
You know, I'd be happy to help
you outwith that, if you want.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.145
No, thanks.

33:29.107 --> 33:30.347
Hey, you ready to go?

33:30.442 --> 33:31.648
Yeah!

33:32.444 --> 33:33.445
Kevin!

33:34.212 --> 33:36.692
Noah, can you give us
a second, please?

33:40.218 --> 33:41.492
You can wait
for him outside.

33:42.454 --> 33:43.865
Yeah, I'll be
down in a minute.

33:43.955 --> 33:45.059
Oh, sure, yeah.

33:46.658 --> 33:48.399
Mom, that was really rude.
Why'd you do that?

33:48.493 --> 33:49.972
He's here way too much.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.234
You're the one who
told him he could be

33:51.329 --> 33:52.535
and he's coming
to dinner tonight.

33:52.631 --> 33:54.702
No, your dad's
coming to dinner tonight.

33:54.799 --> 33:56.142
So, why can't
he come, too?

33:56.501 --> 33:58.981
I want it to just be
the three of us, okay?

34:00.138 --> 34:02.243
Okay, yeah.
Okay.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.184
All right.
I'll see you later, then.

34:08.146 --> 34:10.422
My Uncle Bob was
a tail gunner in Korea,

34:10.514 --> 34:12.859
and a sergeant in Vietnam.

34:12.918 --> 34:14.829
Tough old dude.

34:15.987 --> 34:17.830
Now he's laying
in Valley Memorial,

34:17.889 --> 34:20.335
hoping the transplant takes.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.429
Here, you got that?

34:22.527 --> 34:23.938
Thanks.

34:28.333 --> 34:30.074
Your dad seems to be
around a lot now, huh?

34:30.569 --> 34:31.946
Yeah, I guess.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.510
Like a dinner
and a camping trip

34:36.574 --> 34:38.521
can just make you forget about
how he walked out on you.

34:43.447 --> 34:45.121
Yeah, it's so predictable.

34:45.216 --> 34:46.559
A guy hits middle age,

34:46.618 --> 34:48.620
and suddenly
staring death in the face.

34:48.786 --> 34:50.027
You know,
tire around the waist,

34:50.088 --> 34:51.192
hair in the drain,

34:51.255 --> 34:52.757
cock that just
won't stand up anymore.

34:52.857 --> 34:54.063
He wants to
feel alive again.

34:54.125 --> 34:55.195
He wants to
feel that rush,

34:55.460 --> 34:57.701
you know, he felt
when he was our age.

34:59.931 --> 35:03.037
So, he picks up
a younger woman and poof!

35:04.636 --> 35:06.138
Whole new life.

35:07.572 --> 35:09.711
Go ahead and aim.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.928
Almost.
Little better, right?

35:18.984 --> 35:20.986
Yeah. Here,
switch with me real quick.

35:23.221 --> 35:24.928
Then the guilt sets in.

35:24.990 --> 35:27.766
Because he basically just left
the first kid in the dust.

35:28.226 --> 35:29.933
So, he tries to bribe him.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.098
With things.

35:33.498 --> 35:36.308
Like computers.

35:45.110 --> 35:46.145
Wow.

35:48.647 --> 35:49.990
You follow me?

35:53.618 --> 35:55.495
So, what's up?
How's school?

35:56.254 --> 35:57.699
It is what it is.

35:57.789 --> 35:59.632
Tell him about
your computer class.

35:59.691 --> 36:01.830
He's learning how to
write his own software.

36:01.926 --> 36:03.166
Like father, like son.

36:03.261 --> 36:06.265
That's cool. We can
do some stuff together.

36:07.766 --> 36:09.712
I dropped it.
What?

36:10.635 --> 36:12.945
I dropped it.
It was boring.

36:14.105 --> 36:15.880
Going out for boxing now.

36:16.141 --> 36:18.621
You're going out for boxing?
You don't like boxing!

36:19.144 --> 36:20.623
How would you know?

36:21.046 --> 36:22.354
How would you know?

36:22.447 --> 36:24.449
Seriously, how would you know what
I like and what I don't like?

36:24.516 --> 36:25.688
Am I missing something here?

36:25.784 --> 36:26.888
Yeah!

36:26.985 --> 36:28.965
Okay. You've been missing it
for nine months, Dad!

36:29.020 --> 36:30.363
You just can't
come back in here

36:30.455 --> 36:31.991
and expect to pick up,
like nothing happened!

36:32.190 --> 36:33.498
All right, Kevin,
that's enough!

36:33.558 --> 36:36.004
No! Mom, he's gotta
hear this! Okay.

36:36.061 --> 36:38.007
Life's been happening, Dad.

36:40.331 --> 36:42.709
You know what, Mom,
I got homework to do.

36:42.801 --> 36:45.975
Kevin, wait. At least
finish your dinner!

36:46.037 --> 36:47.880
Let him go.

36:47.972 --> 36:49.315
He just probably
needs some space.

37:00.151 --> 37:02.427
Here we go.
Yeah, yeah.

37:03.888 --> 37:07.062
Hey, uh, how was
dinner with your dad?

37:09.160 --> 37:10.696
Let's just take a break,
all right'?

37:10.762 --> 37:12.708
No, keep going!

37:12.764 --> 37:14.368
Come on, talk to me.
Dinner?

37:16.935 --> 37:18.608
God, I was a jerk, okay?

37:18.703 --> 37:20.876
I feel really bad about it.

37:20.939 --> 37:23.078
No! No! Dude' that's good.

37:23.174 --> 37:25.085
It means he knows
you're onto his bullshit.

37:25.176 --> 37:27.952
We just have to hope that
your mom doesn't fall for it.

37:28.046 --> 37:29.957
Can't let her, uh,
be his meantime girl.

37:31.182 --> 37:32.388
What's that?

37:32.450 --> 37:34.726
You know, someone he
screws in the meantime.

37:37.555 --> 37:38.693
Hey, uh, come on.

37:39.524 --> 37:41.367
Someone he screws
in the meantime?

37:43.895 --> 37:45.465
Yeah. Put your body
into it, there we go!

37:45.563 --> 37:47.372
Kev! Take it easy, Kev!

37:47.632 --> 37:48.906
Calm down!

37:49.067 --> 37:51.479
Easy' easy! Kev!

37:51.903 --> 37:53.211
Hey! Hey! Hey!

37:53.271 --> 37:54.773
Kev! Kev!

37:55.406 --> 37:56.976
What do I do?
What do I do?

37:57.375 --> 37:58.410
God damn it!

38:03.281 --> 38:05.887
Where's your pen?
Where's your pen?

38:11.322 --> 38:12.733
Shit!

38:15.593 --> 38:18.802
Kev. Kev, I got it!
What do I do with it?

38:18.897 --> 38:20.137
Oh, my God!

38:21.065 --> 38:22.976
Where do I put this?

38:23.802 --> 38:24.803
BOY: Shove it in the leg!

38:29.407 --> 38:30.909
Is it working?

38:34.145 --> 38:35.818
You good?

38:35.947 --> 38:37.153
Oh, my...

38:37.582 --> 38:39.755
Are you all right?

38:39.818 --> 38:41.525
Oh, my God.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.458
You're not dying
on me today, okay.

38:46.624 --> 38:48.501
God! Get over here!

39:02.473 --> 39:04.384
Garrett's coming on
a little strong,

39:04.475 --> 39:06.113
don't you think?

39:06.377 --> 39:08.118
What makes you think they're
from Garrett?

39:11.449 --> 39:12.450
Did you read my card?

39:12.550 --> 39:14.154
Would I read your card?

39:21.059 --> 39:22.629
"Please give me
another chance"

39:23.962 --> 39:25.407
What? It's a thin envelope.

39:25.563 --> 39:26.667
Ugh.

39:27.165 --> 39:29.145
Tell me you're not going to.

39:29.734 --> 39:30.974
I'm thinking about it.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.538
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Oh, I know! I know.

39:33.638 --> 39:34.981
Let's tell him
to take his cookies

39:35.039 --> 39:36.245
and shove 'em
right up his ass.

39:36.341 --> 39:38.912
You know what? Enough
with the cookie jokes.

39:39.010 --> 39:41.513
We've all done things in our lives
that we wish we wouldn't have.

39:43.548 --> 39:44.754
You know what?
Maybe you should start

39:44.849 --> 39:46.590
worrying about yourself
for a change.

39:47.018 --> 39:49.225
Ifs way more fun
worrying about you.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.694
Make him grovel
just a little bit, I swear...

39:52.757 --> 39:54.259
Hey!
Hey!

39:55.093 --> 39:56.367
Um... 

39:56.594 --> 39:58.665
Uh, did I catch you
at a bad time?

39:58.730 --> 40:01.074
No, never. They're
beautiful, Garrett.

40:01.165 --> 40:03.076
What is?
The flowers!

40:03.167 --> 40:04.840
Flowers? What flowers?

40:06.170 --> 40:08.912
Claire? Hello?

40:09.007 --> 40:10.850
You know what, I'm going
to call you back.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.211
I need to talk to you.

40:44.409 --> 40:46.980
I'm busy with
physical education.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.250
I believe you're familiar
with that subject, right?

40:49.547 --> 40:50.651
Noah!

40:54.385 --> 40:56.661
Those flowers?
What were you thinking?

40:57.055 --> 40:58.227
They were
a peace offering.

40:59.223 --> 41:01.134
Do you know what
that looks like?

41:01.292 --> 41:03.135
A student sending
a teacher flowers?

41:03.227 --> 41:04.570
That's why I didn't
sign the card.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.075
And you hacked my email?

41:07.799 --> 41:09.142
You said I could be
in your class.

41:09.233 --> 41:11.406
And you're trying to turn
Kevin against his father!

41:11.469 --> 41:12.948
You can't blame me

41:13.004 --> 41:15.280
for the trouble your cheating
ex-husband has brought upon himself.

41:15.340 --> 41:16.614
Stop it!

41:18.242 --> 41:20.654
You're welcome, by the way.
For saving your son'?

41:25.316 --> 41:26.920
Thank you.

41:27.085 --> 41:28.621
You know what,
you're right,

41:28.686 --> 41:29.858
I should have thanked you.

41:30.955 --> 41:32.628
Everything okay,
Claire?

41:32.757 --> 41:33.997
Yes, Mike.

41:34.092 --> 41:35.662
Everything's fine.
Thanks.

41:38.863 --> 41:41.605
Look, I just want us
to start over, Noah, okay?

41:41.666 --> 41:43.009
Can we do that, please?

41:45.336 --> 41:48.112
Yeah. I can if you can.

41:49.941 --> 41:51.352
So, deal?

41:51.676 --> 41:53.485
You can trust me, Claire.

41:54.145 --> 41:55.146
Okay?

41:57.215 --> 41:58.956
Okay.

42:13.064 --> 42:15.044
Allie'! Hey.

42:15.199 --> 42:17.543
Hi, Kev.
Need something?

42:17.635 --> 42:21.708
Yeah, um, I need four three-eighth
hex head bolts, nuts and washers.

42:21.806 --> 42:25.185
And I need an air filter
for a 201 <i>2 Silverado Z71.</i>

42:25.309 --> 42:27.152
And I need you to go
to a movie with me.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.222
I'm kind of busy with work.

42:30.314 --> 42:32.521
And now that school's started...
Um...

42:33.184 --> 42:34.561
Okay.

42:35.486 --> 42:36.487
Um...

42:36.587 --> 42:38.328
Well, I guess
I'll see you around, then.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.832
But I don't have
a date to the Fall Fling.

42:44.662 --> 42:46.266
Uh, me neither.

42:47.698 --> 42:49.336
That's! be really great.

42:50.401 --> 42:52.347
Like, really, really, um...

42:52.570 --> 42:53.742
Great?

42:53.838 --> 42:55.215
Yeah, great.

42:55.506 --> 42:56.712
Great.

42:56.908 --> 42:59.013
Okay. Well, um,
I'll see you around.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.556
Okay, cool.
Okay.

43:20.465 --> 43:22.467
I think I like
the first one better.

43:22.567 --> 43:23.944
You do?
Yeah.

43:24.035 --> 43:28.040
Then the soldier says, "No, no,
buddy, she didn't have a head."

43:30.475 --> 43:31.954
Oh, God.
It's stupid.

43:32.043 --> 43:33.954
It is stupid.

43:48.826 --> 43:49.964
I'm not ready.

43:50.061 --> 43:51.131
What?

43:52.563 --> 43:53.803
There's someone else?

43:53.931 --> 43:56.605
No! But we were apart.

43:56.734 --> 43:58.680
Hey, no, no. I don't wanna know.
Look, it was nothing.

43:58.769 --> 44:01.079
It just made me
realize how lost I was.

44:01.139 --> 44:03.244
Me too, Claire.
We gotta...

44:03.307 --> 44:04.843
Listen, we gotta
have a clean slate.

44:04.942 --> 44:06.012
Okay.

44:06.844 --> 44:09.017
But until I get
my head straight,

44:09.113 --> 44:11.593
I'm not ready to
just jump back in,

44:11.649 --> 44:13.595
and I need you
to know that.

44:15.286 --> 44:16.594
All right.

44:17.088 --> 44:18.533
All right.

44:18.689 --> 44:21.169
It's honest. Okay?

44:21.692 --> 44:23.535
No guarantees, I get it.

44:23.628 --> 44:25.005
Okay.

44:27.165 --> 44:28.337
Um...

44:29.367 --> 44:31.711
I think I had one too many.

44:32.537 --> 44:34.380
Can I crash on the couch?

44:36.307 --> 44:38.480
Okay.

45:51.415 --> 45:54.396
I just want you to know,
I'm not giving up on us.

45:56.254 --> 45:59.030
Well, I want you know
that I'm not asking you to.

46:07.698 --> 46:09.939
Kevin! Let's go!

46:16.974 --> 46:19.477
What a fucking whore
you are!

46:19.577 --> 46:20.817
"Deal," you said.
"Let's make a deal."

46:20.911 --> 46:22.288
You trying to
play me, Claire?

46:22.380 --> 46:23.825
Is that what this is?
Of course not.

46:23.914 --> 46:25.052
Bullshit!

46:25.116 --> 46:26.151
What?

46:26.284 --> 46:28.093
Why are you doing this? Because
you're a fucking liar!

46:28.152 --> 46:29.130
What is wrong with you?

46:29.220 --> 46:30.221
I'm seeing things
clearly now.

46:30.288 --> 46:32.962
You have to stop! Hey,
Noah, what's going on?

46:33.824 --> 46:35.394
Game on.

46:36.127 --> 46:37.572
Mom, what just happened?

46:37.662 --> 46:39.437
Honey, I need you to stay
away from Noah, okay?

46:39.497 --> 46:40.999
He's a bad influence.

46:41.098 --> 46:42.236
What are you talking about?

46:42.667 --> 46:44.305
You're just going to have
to trust me on this one.

46:44.402 --> 46:46.507
No, I'm not going
to trust you! Okay.

46:46.604 --> 46:48.413
'Cause you're not taking away
the one good friend I have.

46:48.472 --> 46:49.780
He is not your friend!

46:49.840 --> 46:51.513
Bullshit!
Mom, he's my friend!

46:51.609 --> 46:54.180
Excuse me? Watch your
mouth and get in the car!

46:54.312 --> 46:56.155
You know, he said you'd do this.
What?

46:56.247 --> 46:57.487
He said you'd do this,
and if you did,

46:57.581 --> 46:58.821
then it was Dad
talking and not you.

46:58.916 --> 47:00.623
He's been right all along!
This is crazy!

47:00.685 --> 47:02.528
Noah, wait!

47:02.620 --> 47:05.601
Kevin! I'm asking you
to get in the car.

47:08.292 --> 47:09.862
See you at school.

47:14.765 --> 47:16.176
Hey! Whoa!

47:16.267 --> 47:17.940
Excuse me.
Hello.

47:18.536 --> 47:20.447
Move! Move!

47:33.951 --> 47:34.952
Hey, Peterson!

47:35.953 --> 47:38.456
Your movie was on Turner
Classics last night.

47:38.522 --> 47:40.365
The Wiz.

47:41.225 --> 47:43.796
It's like the black version
of The Wizard of Oz.

47:45.129 --> 47:47.405
The Wizards of Waverly Place
are on tomorrow.

47:47.498 --> 47:48.499
Fuck you, Zimmer!

47:48.566 --> 47:49.977
Want some of this?
Yeah, fuck you!

47:57.575 --> 48:00.385
Stop it! Noah, stop it! Stop it!

48:00.544 --> 48:02.046
Get off!

48:04.982 --> 48:06.723
Get up! Get the fuck up!

48:09.487 --> 48:10.488
Noah, stop!

48:13.357 --> 48:14.927
Fuck you!

48:17.261 --> 48:18.672
So, I was looking
at your files.

48:18.729 --> 48:19.764
Why?

48:19.864 --> 48:22.105
I'm a vice principal.
It's my job.

48:22.333 --> 48:23.334
Whatever.

48:23.401 --> 48:25.438
So, what a surprise
I found when we didn't

48:25.536 --> 48:27.072
have your transcripts
from your old school,

48:27.171 --> 48:29.447
so I called them.
Know what they told me?

48:29.540 --> 48:31.178
To mind your own business?
No!

48:31.776 --> 48:34.120
That you were kicked out
for disorderly conduct.

48:34.912 --> 48:37.916
Jason Zimmer's skull is fractured.
You could have killed him!

48:38.048 --> 48:39.083
Okay

48:39.183 --> 48:40.719
I'm not done.
lam.

48:40.851 --> 48:43.457
I'm not! Sit down!

48:43.621 --> 48:45.692
I said sit down!

48:50.227 --> 48:51.535
You know what I see?

48:51.762 --> 48:55.039
I see a pattern of disturbing behavior.
Poor impulse control.

48:55.132 --> 48:56.304
You know what I see?

48:57.735 --> 48:59.772
A pathetic old woman
who's trying to look

48:59.870 --> 49:00.940
and act like
something she's not.

49:01.038 --> 49:02.278
Something she'll never be.

49:03.641 --> 49:05.143
Because all she really is

49:06.577 --> 49:11.890
is a dried up,
dirty, fucking cunt.

49:18.222 --> 49:20.168
You're gone'
you're expelled!

49:28.132 --> 49:30.169
Kevin, you don't want
to keep her waiting.

49:30.267 --> 49:31.575
Come on,
you're going to be late!

49:31.635 --> 49:33.012
Mom, we're going
to get there too early,

49:33.103 --> 49:34.605
nobody's even
going to be there.

49:37.107 --> 49:38.347
Okay, how do I look?

49:41.245 --> 49:42.849
Like the handsomest man
on Earth.

49:42.947 --> 49:44.153
Mom, come on,
please, stop.

49:44.248 --> 49:45.192
Seriously, come on,

49:45.282 --> 49:46.352
tonight has gotta be
perfect, all right?

49:46.450 --> 49:48.691
Because Allie Callahan's the
most beautiful girl in school

49:48.786 --> 49:50.527
and I just never thought she'd
actually go out with me.

49:50.621 --> 49:51.793
Okay, please, stop.

49:52.122 --> 49:54.796
Well, she obviously knows
quality when she sees it.

49:55.793 --> 49:56.794
Mmm.

50:01.098 --> 50:02.475
She'll love it! Come on!

50:04.702 --> 50:05.874
BOY: Hey!

50:13.844 --> 50:15.323
Hi, Kev.
You look amazing.

50:16.847 --> 50:18.849
Thanks, Allie. Uh, you
look really great, loo.

50:20.117 --> 50:21.221
Thanks.

50:22.520 --> 50:24.022
Uh, this is...
That's for you.

50:24.121 --> 50:25.225
Thank you.

50:25.389 --> 50:26.993
Mrs. Peterson?
Yes?

50:27.157 --> 50:28.636
Um, some of the guys
said there's water

50:28.692 --> 50:30.069
running out of
the boys' bathroom.

50:30.160 --> 50:31.867
Oh, okay. Um...

50:32.830 --> 50:34.400
You guys go. Have fun.

50:34.498 --> 50:36.068
Okay

50:36.233 --> 50:37.906
I'll check it out.
Okay.

50:41.138 --> 50:43.641
So, do you like the flower? Yeah.
I love it, thank you so much.

50:46.343 --> 50:48.254
Anybody in there?

50:50.014 --> 50:51.152
Ugh.

51:17.575 --> 51:19.020
We need to talk.

51:22.546 --> 51:24.890
Your behavior has been
completely unacceptable.

51:24.949 --> 51:26.087
My behavior?

51:26.183 --> 51:28.129
And I'm not going
to stand for it.

51:28.953 --> 51:30.455
Just let me go.

51:30.554 --> 51:32.591
So, what, your shit-head
husband comes crawling back

51:32.690 --> 51:34.363
and you're just
done with me?

51:34.425 --> 51:35.870
Suddenly,
I'm nothing to you?

51:35.926 --> 51:38.930
Like what we had
never even happened.

51:39.029 --> 51:41.475
It was one night, and it was a mistake!
We had nothing!

51:41.565 --> 51:44.910
Hey, hey! Yes, we did.

51:48.639 --> 51:50.380
And you loved it.

51:51.976 --> 51:53.080
Just like this.

51:53.143 --> 51:54.213
No.

51:56.413 --> 51:57.448
No.

51:59.883 --> 52:01.624
Just like this.
Don't.

52:10.494 --> 52:11.802
You think you can scare me

52:11.895 --> 52:14.000
with some graffiti
on the wall?

52:14.999 --> 52:16.342
Think again!

52:16.567 --> 52:19.013
It's going to be
your word against mine!

52:19.103 --> 52:20.776
And who do you think
they're going to believe?

52:20.838 --> 52:22.818
Stay away from me!

52:23.307 --> 52:25.685
And stay away from my son!

53:33.977 --> 53:35.251
Sorry, guys.

53:35.345 --> 53:36.881
Good morning!

53:45.222 --> 53:46.326
Um...

53:46.490 --> 53:47.867
Give me one second, okay?

54:34.371 --> 54:35.748
What's going on?

54:35.906 --> 54:37.579
She locked us out.

54:47.417 --> 54:49.727
Mrs. Peterson,
open this door!

54:55.259 --> 54:56.397
Mrs. Peterson!

55:00.964 --> 55:02.807
Open this door now!

55:17.748 --> 55:19.659
Mrs. Peterson,
I'm coming in!

55:33.764 --> 55:34.765
Come on in.

55:34.832 --> 55:35.867
What the devil's going on?

55:35.966 --> 55:37.036
The bell rang
five minutes ago.

55:37.134 --> 55:38.204
Oh, I'm sorry, Ed.

55:38.302 --> 55:39.372
Take a seat. Come on.

55:39.469 --> 55:41.107
Why was your
door locked, Claire?

55:41.171 --> 55:42.980
Oh, I just had
a personal call.

55:45.309 --> 55:47.380
You guys take
your seat, okay?

55:47.945 --> 55:49.185
All right.

55:49.279 --> 55:51.953
You know what, give Mrs.
Peterson and I a second.

55:59.356 --> 56:02.667
I'm concerned, Claire.
Very concerned.

56:02.726 --> 56:05.673
Your behavior lately has
raised a lot of eyebrows.

56:06.296 --> 56:08.037
Mike Avenido
reported an incident

56:08.131 --> 56:10.338
in the gym with you
and Noah Sandborn.

56:10.901 --> 56:13.472
Oh. Yeah, I remember that.

56:13.670 --> 56:17.208
Thai was when I was reprimanding
him for skipping class.

56:17.307 --> 56:19.344
Mike said that you
got physical with him,

56:19.409 --> 56:21.411
that you put
your hands on him.

56:21.678 --> 56:23.487
Now, you know what
our policy is regarding

56:23.547 --> 56:25.254
the use of physical force
on students.

56:25.349 --> 56:27.727
Well, I would hardly say
I was using physical force!

56:27.818 --> 56:31.095
I'm not questioning
your integrity here, okay?

56:31.188 --> 56:33.691
But I'm questioning
your behavior.

56:34.825 --> 56:35.997
Get it together.

56:36.860 --> 56:38.032
Please.

56:46.670 --> 56:47.842
Hey, Kev!

56:54.511 --> 56:55.512
What?

56:55.579 --> 56:57.388
I told your mom
I'd pick you up today.

56:58.348 --> 57:01.591
Because I think it's time for
you to drive this bad boy.

57:13.764 --> 57:15.539
I'm not used to you driving.

57:15.732 --> 57:17.712
Yeah, well,
I've been doing it awhile.

57:17.868 --> 57:18.903
I guess.

57:21.538 --> 57:22.949
Come on, buddy,
slow down.

57:24.574 --> 57:26.110
You like to drive fast,
isn't that right?

57:26.877 --> 57:28.982
I mean, why else
get a car like this?

57:29.079 --> 57:30.422
Unless you're trying
to be something

57:30.480 --> 57:31.925
that you're just
completely not.

57:36.219 --> 57:38.096
Kevin, slow down!

57:38.221 --> 57:39.666
Do you have any idea
what that was like

57:39.756 --> 57:40.996
when you were gone?

57:41.091 --> 57:43.628
You didn't
see her, Dad, okay.

57:43.727 --> 57:44.967
She wasn't Mom anymore.

57:45.062 --> 57:47.008
She was just
completely torn apart,

57:47.097 --> 57:48.508
and I had to
sit back and watch

57:48.598 --> 57:50.077
and there was nothing
that I could do about it!

57:53.103 --> 57:54.741
Kevin!

57:54.905 --> 57:56.111
Slow this car down!

57:58.909 --> 57:59.910
Oh, no!

58:01.111 --> 58:02.112
Oh.

58:02.245 --> 58:03.747
What's wrong?
What's going on?

58:03.914 --> 58:04.984
It's not braking!

58:05.148 --> 58:06.786
Hit the brakes! 
It's not working!

58:06.950 --> 58:08.293
Downshift!

58:08.752 --> 58:10.425
Downshift, downshift!

58:10.754 --> 58:12.825
There's no clutch! What do
you mean there's no clutch?

58:12.990 --> 58:15.095
Look out!
Here comes a car!

58:15.258 --> 58:16.259
Lookout! Watch out!

58:17.427 --> 58:18.929
Oh, fuck!

58:19.096 --> 58:21.269
Okay. All right, here goes.
Straight, straight.

58:21.365 --> 58:23.777
Here comes another one, Kevin.
Stay right here!

58:23.934 --> 58:25.641
Kevin, look out!
Look out!

58:27.938 --> 58:29.144
Nothing's working, Dad!

58:30.107 --> 58:31.484
GARRETT:
We gotta get off the road!

58:31.641 --> 58:33.120
Emergency brake, punch it!

58:33.276 --> 58:34.687
Punch it!

58:36.113 --> 58:37.183
Oh, shit!

58:44.654 --> 58:45.962
I'm so sorry!

58:46.289 --> 58:49.361
Are you all right? It's okay.

58:49.459 --> 58:52.235
It's okay, son.
It's okay.

59:21.825 --> 59:23.202
Kevin!

59:26.930 --> 59:27.931
Garrett'?

59:28.165 --> 59:29.269
Hey, we're in here
watching TV.

59:32.869 --> 59:34.212
What happened to your car?

59:34.504 --> 59:36.745
Oh, nothing. I had a
little fender bender.

59:36.873 --> 59:38.181
We're all right.

59:38.408 --> 59:39.580
Yeah.

59:39.743 --> 59:41.416
They look, uh,
fine to me.

59:43.246 --> 59:44.520
Hey, Mrs. Peterson.

59:45.348 --> 59:46.918
We're watching
the Detroit Grand Prix.

59:47.017 --> 59:48.189
Come on in
and get a slice.

59:48.418 --> 59:50.864
Yeah, there's
plenty of room.

59:52.589 --> 59:54.569
I gotta unpack
the groceries.

59:56.026 --> 59:58.028
I'm gonna get something
else to munch on.

01:00:00.464 --> 01:00:01.602
Look at these clowns.

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:02.938
Do you have any chips?

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.379
You took pictures!

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:07.711
A video, actually.
Capture the moment.

01:00:07.871 --> 01:00:10.112
Come over tonight.

01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:11.982
After they're asleep.
Say, 2:00?

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:13.645
Go fuck yourself!

01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:15.552
I'd rather fuck you.

01:00:16.413 --> 01:00:18.393
You're fucking crazy!

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:21.662
Who should I
show it to first?

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:22.957
Garrett'?

01:00:23.887 --> 01:00:25.628
Or maybe... Kevin!

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:27.224
No!
Yeah?

01:00:28.592 --> 01:00:29.798
Do you want a soda?

01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:32.134
That sounds good.
Thanks!

01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:33.731
Hey, I'll take another
cold one, please!

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:35.401
Yeah, anything
for you, Garrett.

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:40.270
I'll leave the light on.

01:00:51.781 --> 01:00:52.919
Noah?

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:02.794
Hey, you're early.

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:04.198
Where's the damn video?

01:01:04.928 --> 01:01:06.271
Why are you so angry?

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:08.002
What you did in my
classroom today?

01:01:08.098 --> 01:01:09.475
You've been avoiding me.

01:01:09.533 --> 01:01:11.774
What do you think? This is some
kind of game we're playing here?

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:13.276
This is real life!

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:15.441
That is my home!

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:16.948
Okay. You're doing things
in front of my kid,

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:18.315
in front of my husband?

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:22.351
Your husband. Your fucking
cheating, lying husband?

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.959
Okay. What's your plan?

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:28.357
What do you think? What do you
think, we're going to date?

01:01:29.319 --> 01:01:31.890
We're going to go on
family vacations together?

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:34.662
What do you think
is going to happen here?

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:37.068
Here? Nothing.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.367
But it's a big world
out there, Claire.

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:40.805
Oh, my God, this is crazy!

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:42.502
No, no, no,
wait, wait, wait!

01:01:43.967 --> 01:01:44.968
Wait.

01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:55.323
You see that video,
and the proof of our love

01:01:56.313 --> 01:02:00.819
as a threat to this life,
but I see it as a promise.

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:02.886
For a better one.

01:02:02.986 --> 01:02:06.160
And none of this will
ever see the light of day.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:17.837
If you let me show you
what's possible.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:22.876
Because, Claire,

01:02:24.341 --> 01:02:26.844
I will never

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:29.513
ever gonna let you go.

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:36.859
Fucking crazy!

01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:56.782
Oh, Claire.

01:02:57.707 --> 01:03:00.085
Okay,
why didn't you tell me?

01:03:01.578 --> 01:03:04.081
I thought that
I could handle it.

01:03:04.147 --> 01:03:06.718
I thought that it was gonna
just blow over, I don't know.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.888
I didn't think he was going
to turn into a stalker!

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:11.795
Okay, okay. Look, we can look
at this picture and we see,

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:14.300
we know that
he's a psychopath,

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:16.803
but it's not the way the rest
of the world's going to see it.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.233
And there's a video.

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:22.899
What?

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:25.446
There's a video,
and if it gets out,

01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:28.249
you know I'm going to
lose my son,

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:32.253
my husband,
my job, my life.

01:03:32.342 --> 01:03:34.652
Everything that I've ever worked for.
Okay, Claire, listen to me.

01:03:34.778 --> 01:03:37.088
Claire, that's not going to happen.
Do you know why?

01:03:37.414 --> 01:03:39.917
I'm not gonna let that
happen, and neither are you.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:42.753
No one is going
to see that video.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:44.821
It won't see
the light of day.

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:16.121
What?
Claire, he saw me.

01:05:16.212 --> 01:05:18.283
Get the hell out of there,
he's coming back there!

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:20.793
Wait. I haven't even found
the video or the files yet.

01:05:20.884 --> 01:05:23.728
Get the hell out of there,
you got five minutes max!

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.517
Mrs. Peterson!
Mr. Sand born!

01:08:05.682 --> 01:08:08.526
You scared the living daylights
out of me. I'm sorry.

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.856
What in the world
are you doing here?

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.260
Sorry.

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:16.734
Tell me that you're home,

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:17.930
and that all the doors
are locked.

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:19.368
Yes.

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:22.932
And I found the computer
and I deleted all the files.

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:24.705
Good. Good.

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:26.872
But I found something else
even creepier.

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:29.109
I'm not surprised.
He's a freak!

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:31.582
Does Ethan know any cops
in San Bernardino?

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.948
Oh, I'm sure he does.

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:34.316
If we're not having
dinner with his mother,

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:35.821
we 're having dinner
with cops.

01:08:35.912 --> 01:08:37.050
Why?

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.049
Just a hunch.

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:42.457
I might have to go
there later. I'll call him.

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:44.087
He went to Laughlin
with his mother

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.961
for her birthday.
Welcome to my world.

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:47.398
But listen...

01:08:48.224 --> 01:08:49.635
What?
He's here!

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:50.966
Get out of there! Run!

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:53.404
Claire! Claire!

01:08:54.063 --> 01:08:55.064
I'm gonna call the cops!

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:59.078
Talk to me, Claire! I'm dying!
He's trying to force the lock.

01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:00.236
What?

01:09:00.403 --> 01:09:01.939
Oh, God!

01:09:03.573 --> 01:09:04.779
Run, hide!

01:09:09.011 --> 01:09:10.923
Hey, Mom,
what's with the knife?

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.149
It's Kevin.

01:09:12.415 --> 01:09:13.416
Oh, my God!

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:14.618
Oh.
I'm going crazy.

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:18.027
You guys have to spend the
night with me, out here, okay?

01:09:18.121 --> 01:09:19.997
Oh, God.
I love you very much.

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:22.098
I'll talk to you later.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.682
Ethan, uh, said you wanted to
take a look at the Sandborn case.

01:09:37.774 --> 01:09:38.809
Yes.

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:40.149
Sad. I remember it.

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:44.113
They were on a back road
outside San Bernardino.

01:09:44.947 --> 01:09:47.894
Tire marks indicated the driver
had lost control of the car.

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:02.635
The crash killed both
passengers instantly.

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.542
And it was ruled
an accident?

01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:06.545
Bodies were destroyed,
so there was no toxicology.

01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:08.513
But we assumed
the driver was drunk.

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:10.241
Why was that?

01:10:10.473 --> 01:10:12.544
Well, he had
a long history of DUl's.

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:16.316
Or his brakes went out. I mean,
they could have been tampered with.

01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:19.323
Well, Mrs. Peterson,
even if his brakes went out,

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:21.760
there was no indication
of malfeasance.

01:10:21.851 --> 01:10:23.831
Sometimes,
breaks malfunction.

01:10:23.986 --> 01:10:26.159
Sometimes, people drive
while intoxicated.

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:27.596
This is the Sandborn car.

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:36.871
If you don't need
anything else...

01:10:38.668 --> 01:10:41.171
One more question,
Detective. Um...

01:10:43.206 --> 01:10:45.516
Was this a 2006 minivan?

01:10:45.675 --> 01:10:49.179
Well, yeah.
That's exactly what it is.

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:52.918
Is there something else I
need to know, Mrs. Peterson?

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:57.090
No.

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:01.864
Thank you.

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:20.215
Hey, Noah.
Are you home?

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:21.380
Yeah, what's up?

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:22.787
You got plans tonight?

01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:24.950
Well, I'm supposed to go
to that car show with my dad.

01:11:25.047 --> 01:11:26.890
Well, I'm over here
working on Vicky's tractor.

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.053
You're at Vicky's?

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:29.892
Yeah, I'm at her ranch.
You know where it's at?

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:32.057
Yeah, no, I think
I know where that is.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:33.225
Is everything all right?

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:35.166
Can you and your dad swing by
and give me a hand?

01:11:35.258 --> 01:11:36.566
Yeah, okay. Let me ask.

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:37.832
Just get over here.

01:11:37.927 --> 01:11:39.770
Okay, catch you later. Bye.

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:46.078
Let me just start off
by saying I'm sorry.

01:11:46.936 --> 01:11:50.907
No, really, lam very,

01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:54.685
very sorry,
Vice Principal Lansing.

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:58.986
See,
I've got a bit of a temper.

01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:01.322
There's no denying that

01:12:02.752 --> 01:12:04.629
And sometimes,

01:12:04.954 --> 01:12:06.831
it gets the best of me.

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:10.437
Like, when I feel
like I'm being bullied.

01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:13.171
And no one likes
to be bullied, Vicky.

01:12:13.863 --> 01:12:15.706
Can I call you Vicky?

01:12:16.432 --> 01:12:18.378
I mean, given that
I'm in your house,

01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:20.105
and it's after hours,

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:22.705
calling you Vice Principal
just feels,

01:12:23.139 --> 01:12:26.120
I don't know, wrong.

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:32.617
See, my guess, Vicky,

01:12:32.882 --> 01:12:35.829
is that, uh, you don't
like to be bullied.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:38.362
I mean, who would?

01:12:40.456 --> 01:12:42.732
But that's what you were
doing to me today.

01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:45.795
You and Claire.

01:12:46.128 --> 01:12:47.402
Now, the two of you,

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:50.868
with your little secrets.

01:12:52.902 --> 01:12:54.575
You were playing a joke.

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.980
A silly little game.

01:12:57.673 --> 01:13:00.517
Trying to make me think
that you were her'

01:13:02.178 --> 01:13:04.385
so she could do what?

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:11.858
Something sneaky?

01:13:13.356 --> 01:13:15.358
Something...

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:19.703
She's hiding from me?

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:22.201
What was it, Vicky?

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:28.512
No, no, no.

01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:30.949
Let me.

01:13:35.011 --> 01:13:36.081
Vicky!

01:13:36.178 --> 01:13:38.124
Listen, lam pretty sure

01:13:38.214 --> 01:13:40.854
that Noah tampered with the
brakes on his parents' car

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:42.191
and that's why they crashed.

01:13:43.019 --> 01:13:45.693
And I'm pretty sure he did
the same thing to Garrett's.

01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:48.099
Claire, <i>I need you.</i>

01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:50.466
I need to talk.
Can you come over?

01:14:46.449 --> 01:14:49.521
Vicky! Are you upstairs?

01:15:02.298 --> 01:15:03.504
Vicky?

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.875
Vicky.

01:15:32.795 --> 01:15:34.297
on, my God!

01:15:38.501 --> 01:15:41.004
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:03.826
911. What's your emergency?

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:05.664
Out!

01:16:06.429 --> 01:16:08.670
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:16:12.701 --> 01:16:14.112
You killed Vicky!

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:17.514
For you. For you, okay? She
wasn't your friend, Claire!

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:19.243
Hey, hey, hey!

01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:22.188
When I love somebody,
I protect them.

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:24.224
That's what heroes do.

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:27.255
No heroes kill their
mothers and fathers!

01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:31.760
I would never ever
hurt my mother.

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:33.895
I loved my mother,

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:35.535
but she killed herself.

01:16:38.461 --> 01:16:41.203
My cheating father
and his whore

01:16:41.363 --> 01:16:42.808
got what they deserved.

01:16:42.898 --> 01:16:44.036
But, hey.

01:16:45.034 --> 01:16:47.446
I protect people I love.

01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:49.914
This is all for you.

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:51.144
Okay?

01:16:53.876 --> 01:16:54.877
No!

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:58.448
Now, let's go.

01:17:13.596 --> 01:17:14.666
Garrett!

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:16.902
Garrett!

01:17:19.168 --> 01:17:21.842
Oh, my God!
What did you do to him?

01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:25.150
Well, he ran into
a 14-inch crescent wrench.

01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:26.479
Mom!

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:28.281
Kevin!

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:31.416
Noah, you hurt my mom,
I swear to God...

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.481
Really, Kevin?

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:34.288
I would never
hurt your mother.

01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:36.452
I love your mother.

01:17:36.919 --> 01:17:38.921
Just steady your breathing, baby!

01:17:39.421 --> 01:17:41.264
And honestly,
I'd hoped you'd see me

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:43.030
as a mentor
who cared about you

01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:47.505
more than your
cheating father ever did.

01:17:48.797 --> 01:17:49.969
Tell him, Claire.

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:51.167
Do you need your shot?

01:17:51.267 --> 01:17:52.439
Mom.

01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:54.647
You know,
it's destiny, Claire.

01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:56.444
And you can't
interfere with destiny.

01:17:56.772 --> 01:17:57.842
Mom.

01:18:05.281 --> 01:18:07.158
We're meant to be.

01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:08.819
And Garrett

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:12.121
needs to know that

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:14.327
Wake up! Hey, wake up!

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:23.336
It's gonna be okay.

01:18:24.667 --> 01:18:26.840
You know, I was going
to take Kevin with us.

01:18:28.404 --> 01:18:31.078
Seems like he's got too
much of his father in him.

01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:32.311
No, he needs to go.

01:18:32.675 --> 01:18:33.813
No! No, no, no.

01:18:35.511 --> 01:18:37.149
No, he's not like
his father at all.

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:42.829
Noah' you've taught him.
You've changed him.

01:18:49.858 --> 01:18:51.235
All right.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.868
All right, then, uh...

01:18:53.996 --> 01:18:56.033
He'll come with us.
Yes.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.673
Form our own family.

01:19:14.183 --> 01:19:15.184
Mom! Mom!

01:19:32.568 --> 01:19:33.706
Please, Noah!

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:35.612
Please, just stop this!
Let me help you.

01:19:35.704 --> 01:19:37.274
There's still time.

01:19:37.373 --> 01:19:40.411
There's no time.
This is our time!

01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:42.547
You'll never be lovelier
than you are right now!

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:45.926
We will never be here again!

01:20:05.234 --> 01:20:06.235
What are you doing?

01:20:06.602 --> 01:20:09.310
Building a funeral pyre.
What does it look like?

01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:14.410
You can't do this!

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:16.251
No!
Stop!

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:20.789
I'm sick and tired
of everyone

01:20:20.849 --> 01:20:22.658
going back and forth!

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:24.355
So, it's time to
make a choice, my love!

01:20:25.087 --> 01:20:28.091
You either live with me
or you die with them.

01:20:28.157 --> 01:20:30.137
No! No!

01:20:58.821 --> 01:21:00.300
Take Kev
and get out of here!

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.837
No! No!

01:21:08.564 --> 01:21:11.135
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:21:12.468 --> 01:21:15.005
Oh, my God!
Stay with me, Garrett!

01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:18.375
Garrett, stay with me!
Stay with me!

01:21:18.474 --> 01:21:21.148
All right.
Let's go, Claire.

01:21:22.978 --> 01:21:26.721
You'll see.
You and me. Off-grid.

01:21:28.317 --> 01:21:30.354
There is nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

01:21:35.824 --> 01:21:37.667
You can trust me.

01:21:38.427 --> 01:21:39.428
But, Noah,

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:41.734
you can't trust me!

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:03.188
Die, you piece of fucking shit!
No!

01:22:24.907 --> 01:22:25.908
Ahhh!

01:22:54.570 --> 01:22:58.313
Sorry, buddy,
but sometimes even heroes

01:22:58.407 --> 01:22:59.750
have to make tough choices.

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:00.809
Noah!

01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:03.750
Noah! Noah!

01:23:05.581 --> 01:23:07.083
You're no hero!

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:40.851
I'm here.
I'm right here.

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:44.627
All right, guys, lift on three.
One, two, three.

01:23:44.786 --> 01:23:46.959
Me and Kevin
are right here, sweetie.

01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:55.631
We got him now, ma'am.

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:57.734
Don't you worry.
He's gonna be fine.

01:23:57.833 --> 01:24:00.837
Just hang in there.
Hang in there.

01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:03.343
You're gonna be okay.

01:24:06.475 --> 01:24:08.148
You're going to be okay.

01:24:09.645 --> 01:24:11.522
And then we're
gonna go home.

01:24:14.249 --> 01:24:16.229
You hear me?
We're going home.
