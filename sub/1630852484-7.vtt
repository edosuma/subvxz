You know how the Feds made

I used that as an excuse
to move Hayak's guns--

17:16.243 --> 17:17.161
all of 'em.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.996
And Hayak doesn't know this?

He knows that I moved them.
He just doesn't know where.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.710

17:24.793 --> 17:27.629

with $6 million.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.683
Oh, great.
And then Hayak finds out

17:39.767 --> 17:40.726

to come here weeks ago,

30:49.389 --> 30:52.642

so what does that say, huh?

30:55.562 --> 30:56.521

30:56.604 --> 30:58.773
No, she isn't.

worked up, okay?

doing crap we regret later.

Thony's the one who's involved
with the criminal,

31:06.114 --> 31:08.199
and you're worried
about what I'm gonna do?

31:08.283 --> 31:09.951

is letting this happen.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.278
Besides your feet on a desk

31:48.072 --> 31:50.325
Guess where I found these.

31:50.408 --> 31:51.993
Where?

31:52.076 --> 31:55.288
Oh, on one of the farms
near the Paiute reservation.

31:55.371 --> 31:58.082
Arman Morales has stored
enough guns there

31:58.166 --> 31:59.834
to start World War III.

31:59.917 --> 32:01.836

you went in without a warrant.

Barsamians fund their empire.

wearing cutting off oxygen?

32:11.012 --> 32:14.182
Look, I overheard Arman talking
to one of his lackeys.

32:14.265 --> 32:15.767
He's selling
the entire inventory

32:15.850 --> 32:17.310
to some guy named Noah.

32:17.393 --> 32:18.853
Who's that?

32:20.521 --> 32:22.899
Not sure.

32:22.982 --> 32:26.069
I'm checking with the ATF to
see if they can get us an ID,

32:26.152 --> 32:29.781
but this deal is going
down today at 5:00.

32:29.864 --> 32:32.492
All right?
And once that happens,

32:32.575 --> 32:34.410
I mean,
these guns will be in the wind.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.788
Well, what are we supposed
to do, Miller?

32:36.871 --> 32:39.749
Everything you just told me,
you obtained illegally.

32:39.832 --> 32:41.376
We can't use any of this.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.423
(sighs)

32:47.507 --> 32:49.801
If we can stop the deal,

32:49.884 --> 32:51.844
that'll buy us some time
for you to get us a warrant.

32:51.928 --> 32:52.970
And how do you think
you're gonna

32:53.054 --> 32:54.931

that's happening today?

33:01.229 --> 33:02.980
What?

33:03.064 --> 33:06.609
Look, Arman used Thony
to give us a bad tip.

33:06.693 --> 33:09.779
Who's to say we can't play that
game of telephone in reverse?

Hey.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.667
So...

33:22.750 --> 33:24.001
Luca is getting sicker.

33:24.085 --> 33:25.962
So I talked to my husband,

33:26.045 --> 33:28.423
and if your offer
still stands--

33:28.506 --> 33:30.466
