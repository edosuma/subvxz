00:27.194 --> 00:29.529
What am I doing with my life?

00:29.613 --> 00:31.698
I'm so pale. I should get out more.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.032
I should eat better.

00:33.117 --> 00:36.160
My posture is terrible.
I should stand up straighter.

00:36.245 --> 00:39.247
People would respect me more
if I stood up straighter.

00:39.331 --> 00:41.457
What's wrong with me?
I just want to connect.

00:42.126 --> 00:44.001
Why can't I connect with people?

00:44.503 --> 00:46.754
Oh, right. It's because I'm dead.

00:47.673 --> 00:50.049
I shouldn't be so hard on myself.
I mean, we're all dead.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.802
This girl is dead. That guy's dead.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.637
That guy in the corner is definitely dead.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.055
Jesus, these guys look awful.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.062
I wish I could introduce myself,

01:03.147 --> 01:05.105
but I don't remember my name anymore.

01:05.649 --> 01:08.651
I mean, I think it started with an "R,"
but that's all I have left.

01:09.278 --> 01:12.280
I can't remember my name,
or my parents, or my job.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.824
Although my hoodie would suggest
I was unemployed.

01:16.452 --> 01:19.012
Sometimes I look at the others
and try to imagine what they were.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.206
You were a janitor.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.839
You were the rich son of a corporate CEO.

01:33.969 --> 01:36.763
You were a personal trainer.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.019
And now you're a Corpse.

01:44.229 --> 01:47.940
I have a hard time piecing together
how this whole apocalypse thing happened.

01:48.025 --> 01:50.485
Could have been chemical warfare
or an airborne virus,

01:50.569 --> 01:52.361
or a radioactive outbreak monkey.

01:53.489 --> 01:56.115
But it doesn't really matter.
This is what we are now.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.827
This is a typical day for me.

02:00.162 --> 02:02.830
I shuffle around,
occasionally bumping into people,

02:02.915 --> 02:05.625
unable to apologize
or say much of anything.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.923
It must have been so much better before,

02:12.049 --> 02:13.716
when everyone could express themselves,

02:13.801 --> 02:15.843
and communicate their feelings

02:15.928 --> 02:18.387
and just enjoy each other's company.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.189
A lot of us have made our home
here at this airport.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.524
I don't know why.

02:29.608 --> 02:30.983
People wait at airports, I guess,

02:31.068 --> 02:33.236
but I'm not sure what
we're all waiting for.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.912
Oh, man. They call these guys Boneys.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.039
They don't bother us much.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.803
But they'll eat anything with a heartbeat.

02:47.584 --> 02:50.586
I mean, I will too,
but at least I'm conflicted about it.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.506
We all become them some day.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.550
At some point you just give up, I guess.

02:55.634 --> 02:58.594
You lose all hope.
After that, there's no turning back.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.013
Oh, man, gross.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.307
Stop. Stop, don't pick at it!
You're making it worse!

03:03.976 --> 03:06.602
Oh, this is what I have to look forward to.

03:07.563 --> 03:09.438
It's kind of a bummer.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.192
I don't want to be this way.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.111
I'm lonely. I'm lost.

03:15.654 --> 03:16.735
I mean, I'm literally lost.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.780
I've never been in this part
of the airport before.

03:20.409 --> 03:21.951
Wonder if these guys are lost, too.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.663
Wandering around,
but never getting anywhere.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.291
Do they feel trapped?
Do they want more than this?

03:31.128 --> 03:32.461
Am I the only one?

04:53.460 --> 04:54.877
This is my best friend.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.308
By best friend, I mean
we occasionally grunt

05:00.384 --> 05:02.468
and stare awkwardly at each other.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.391
We even have
almost-conversations sometimes.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.033
Days pass this way.

05:31.081 --> 05:35.501
But sometimes we even find
actual words. Words like...

05:35.794 --> 05:37.003
Hungry.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.255
And...

05:40.090 --> 05:41.340
City.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.435
Even though we can't communicate,

05:52.519 --> 05:54.687
we do share a similar taste in food.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.731
Traveling in packs just
kind of makes sense,

05:56.815 --> 05:58.357
especially when everyone
and their grandmother

05:58.442 --> 06:00.818
is trying to shoot you in the head
all the time.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.575
God, we move slow.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.663
This could take a while.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.713
Hello, and thank you for
your service today.

07:03.381 --> 07:06.050
In the eight years since
this plague destroyed our world...

07:06.259 --> 07:07.927
You think we're getting
this stuff for the cure?

07:08.011 --> 07:09.845
Since we erected this wall...

07:09.930 --> 07:11.764
No one believes in a cure anymore, Jules.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.183
We have counted on
young volunteers like you

07:14.267 --> 07:16.685
to gather resources from beyond the wall.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.772
But first, a word of caution.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.982
Corpses look human, they are not.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.318
They do not think. They do not bleed.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.529
Whether they were your mother
or your best friend,

07:26.613 --> 07:28.280
they are beyond your help.

07:28.365 --> 07:32.535
They are uncaring, unfeeling,
incapable of remorse.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.620
Sound like anyone you know, Dad?

07:34.704 --> 07:36.831
Just picture them as this.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.669
As sons and daughters of
possibly the sole remaining

07:41.753 --> 07:43.379
human settlement on Earth,

07:43.797 --> 07:45.131
you are a critical part

07:45.215 --> 07:48.217
of what stands between us and extinction.

07:49.052 --> 07:52.596
Therefore you have an obligation
to return to us safely.

07:52.681 --> 07:55.683
And if you remember your
training, you will.

07:55.767 --> 07:59.895
Good luck, Godspeed,
and God bless America.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.273
USA! USA!

08:02.357 --> 08:03.399
Let's go.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.669
Sweet.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.379
Hey, Berg, you gonna help us out or what?

09:48.463 --> 09:50.005
No dice. Almost at level five.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.510
Did you hear that?

09:56.179 --> 09:58.555
I did. We should bail.

09:58.890 --> 10:01.141
Oh, hey, we can't just bail.
We have orders.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.894
Do you have any idea how much medicine
the City goes through a month?

10:03.979 --> 10:05.604
We need pharma salvage to survive.

10:05.689 --> 10:08.107
- We can't just abandon our...
- You sound just like my dad.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.317
- Thank you.
- Yeah, it wasn't a compliment.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.445
Oh, here, guys. Take some Prozac.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.697
Maybe that will cheer you up.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.702
I told you I heard something.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.581
Per, let's bail.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.212
Perry?

10:31.298 --> 10:32.506
We have orders, Jules.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.717
It was nothing anyway.

10:36.261 --> 10:37.781
- You're being paranoid, okay?
- Perry!

10:45.562 --> 10:46.645
Aim for their heads!

11:33.943 --> 11:34.943
Smile, mother...

11:43.119 --> 11:44.119
Nice watch.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.375
Now, I'm not proud of this.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.542
In fact, I'd appreciate it

11:50.627 --> 11:52.711
if you might look away for a moment here.

11:53.421 --> 11:56.799
I don't like hurting people,
but this is the world now.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.135
The new hunger is a very powerful thing.

12:02.931 --> 12:06.141
If I don't eat all of him,
if I spare his brain,

12:06.226 --> 12:08.560
he'll rise up and become a Corpse like me.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.855
But if I do, I get his memories,

12:11.940 --> 12:13.899
his thoughts, his feelings.

12:18.196 --> 12:20.072
I'm sorry, I just can't help it.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.323
The brain's the best part.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.659
The part that makes me feel human again.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.166
You like it, Perry?

12:32.919 --> 12:34.420
I don't want to hurt you.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.256
I just want to feel what you felt.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.431
To feel a little better.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.058
A little less dead.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.037
Perry... I think I love you.

13:13.710 --> 13:14.960
Say something.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.088
Don't just say nothing.

13:18.173 --> 13:19.214
No, I...

13:21.050 --> 13:22.426
I think I love you too, Julie.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.147
I miss airplanes.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.733
My mom used to say that it looked like

13:37.817 --> 13:39.318
an Etch A Sketch up there.

13:41.404 --> 13:43.164
I like that you remember
that kind of stuff.

13:44.073 --> 13:48.368
If we don't, then it will just all be gone.
You know?

13:49.454 --> 13:50.496
Yeah.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.332
The world is so messed up.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.375
Not all of it.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.003
Cheeseball.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.178
Perry?

14:08.681 --> 14:09.806
Perry!

14:11.184 --> 14:13.810
Perry, where are you? Answer me!

14:56.354 --> 14:56.898
Julie...

15:53.786 --> 15:55.245
Safe.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.000
Come...

16:00.376 --> 16:01.460
What?

16:23.650 --> 16:26.735
I don't know what I'm doing.
What's wrong with me?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.991
These other guys
would never bring a living person home.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.744
You know why? Because that's crazy!

16:36.829 --> 16:39.122
Right now, they think
she's just another one of us.

16:39.207 --> 16:40.499
A new addition to the family.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.293
But they would think I was insane.

16:43.378 --> 16:44.419
If they could think.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.589
Why do I have to be so weird?

16:48.383 --> 16:49.966
What am I doing?

17:28.297 --> 17:29.464
Home...

18:12.633 --> 18:15.677
Not eat.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.273
Keep you safe.

19:02.892 --> 19:03.892
All right.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.228
Maybe I could have
thought this through a little more.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.772
But I can tell when a girl needs her space.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.200
There's a lot of ways
to get to know a person.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.277
Eating her dead boyfriend's brains

19:14.362 --> 19:16.446
is one of the more
unorthodox methods, but...

19:27.333 --> 19:29.251
It's a special occasion.

19:29.836 --> 19:30.961
A special occasion, sir?

19:31.671 --> 19:33.171
It's Mom's birthday.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.260
- To Diane.
- To Mom.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.344
Yeah.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.179
- It's Mom's birthday.
- So, Perry,

19:41.264 --> 19:44.182
Julie tells me
you've been working in Agriculture.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.249
But tell me you would never consider

19:46.310 --> 19:48.478
going to work construction
with your father.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.689
You know, on the wall we need good people.

19:51.941 --> 19:55.026
Don't mind him, Per.
Dad's idea of saving humanity

19:55.111 --> 19:57.904
is to build a really big concrete box,
put everyone in it,

19:57.989 --> 20:00.782
and then wait at the door with guns
until we grow old and die.

20:02.201 --> 20:06.204
Well, Julie, without the wall,
we would be eating brains now

20:06.289 --> 20:07.914
- instead of rice.
- Dad...

20:10.084 --> 20:11.710
This is the only way past the wall.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.295
Otherwise we get stopped.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.548
Okay...

20:22.096 --> 20:24.306
Come on. It's not that bad. Come on.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.903
I haven't heard from him
in two days, Jules.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.563
He's on construction detail, Perry.
He's working.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.982
My dad goes weeks without checking in.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.157
Okay. This way.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.493
Hey.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.330
It's gonna be okay.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.318
Dad.

21:26.035 --> 21:27.035
Per.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.208
Hey, hey, hey!

21:45.513 --> 21:47.889
Perry! Come on!

21:51.394 --> 21:53.395
No wonder she's so afraid of me.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.690
I need a different approach.

21:57.525 --> 21:59.985
Okay, here we go. Don't be creepy.

22:00.069 --> 22:02.070
Don't be creepy. Don't be creepy.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.088
What are you doing?

22:24.218 --> 22:25.760
Please leave me alone.

22:40.234 --> 22:41.234
Why me?

22:43.612 --> 22:45.280
Why did you save me?

22:46.032 --> 22:47.073
Don't

22:50.369 --> 22:51.786
cry.

23:22.985 --> 23:23.985
Safe.

23:25.279 --> 23:27.322
Keep you safe.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.337
What are you?

24:50.739 --> 24:51.990
I'm hungry.

24:55.286 --> 24:56.828
Just let me go!

24:57.872 --> 24:59.581
Not safe.

24:59.915 --> 25:00.957
Not safe?

25:03.460 --> 25:04.752
Not safe.

25:06.964 --> 25:09.632
Well, then you're just gonna have to
go and get me some food.

25:10.384 --> 25:11.634
Because I'm starved.

25:16.932 --> 25:17.932
Please?

25:19.268 --> 25:21.311
I'd be very grateful for some food.

25:23.772 --> 25:24.814
Okay.

26:15.324 --> 26:16.366
God!

26:21.205 --> 26:22.288
Shit.

26:37.513 --> 26:40.640
Don't run.

26:56.824 --> 26:59.284
Come. Safe.

27:00.327 --> 27:01.536
Thank you.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.090
Be dead.

27:19.680 --> 27:20.888
Okay?

27:29.106 --> 27:30.690
That's too much.

27:42.953 --> 27:47.915
Told you not safe.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.418
Yeah, I get that.

27:52.463 --> 27:54.464
I really am hungry, though.

27:56.467 --> 27:57.508
Yes!

28:03.015 --> 28:04.098
My God.

28:11.148 --> 28:14.609
Oh, no. Stop staring.
You're acting weird again.

28:40.511 --> 28:41.844
Thank you.

28:43.097 --> 28:44.180
Oh, my God.

28:53.023 --> 28:54.190
Oh, man.

28:54.483 --> 28:57.026
I can't remember the
last time I had a beer.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.363
I guess you can't be
all that bad, Mr. Zombie.

29:01.824 --> 29:05.993
My name...

29:07.704 --> 29:08.955
You have a name?

29:10.207 --> 29:11.249
What is your name?

29:14.086 --> 29:16.087
Rrrrrrrrrrrrrr...

29:16.755 --> 29:17.797
Rrrr?

29:18.090 --> 29:19.632
This date is not going well.

29:19.716 --> 29:20.883
I want to die all over again.

29:20.968 --> 29:22.552
Rrrrrrr...

29:22.928 --> 29:24.303
Does your name start with "R"?

29:28.183 --> 29:30.184
Robert? Richard?

29:31.812 --> 29:32.854
Randy?

29:34.189 --> 29:35.898
Raphael? Ricardo?

29:38.610 --> 29:40.278
Why don't I just call you "R"?

29:43.490 --> 29:44.690
I mean, that's a start, right?

29:45.868 --> 29:47.076
R...

29:48.370 --> 29:49.704
I want to go home, R.

29:54.209 --> 29:56.919
It's not safe.

29:57.004 --> 29:58.045
I get that.

29:59.840 --> 30:00.882
And look...

30:01.884 --> 30:03.593
I know that you saved my life.

30:03.677 --> 30:05.428
And I'm grateful for that.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.889
But you walked me into this place.

30:08.098 --> 30:10.266
So I know that you can walk me out again.

30:10.350 --> 30:12.643
Oh, no. She can't leave. She just got here.

30:13.061 --> 30:16.022
Tell her she has to wait.
Tell her they'll notice.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.984
Have to wait.

30:21.987 --> 30:25.072
They... They'll notice.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.408
Not bad.

30:27.743 --> 30:28.743
How long?

30:29.077 --> 30:31.412
Few days.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.959
They'll forget.

30:38.462 --> 30:41.422
You'll be okay.

30:43.634 --> 30:45.551
Are there others like you?

30:48.263 --> 30:49.597
I mean, I've...

30:49.681 --> 30:52.558
I've never ever heard a Corpse talk before.

30:53.644 --> 30:56.562
I mean, apart from the groaning.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.657
Okay. A few days?

31:11.870 --> 31:14.664
What am I supposed to do
for a few days around here anyway?

31:20.212 --> 31:21.712
This is awesome!

31:40.148 --> 31:41.357
You wanna try?

31:50.826 --> 31:51.826
Oh, God!

31:53.662 --> 31:54.745
You're a leadfoot.

31:55.998 --> 31:58.583
Okay. Okay. Pick a foot.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.335
You're using two feet. Pick one foot...

32:02.504 --> 32:05.006
There you go. Okay...

32:07.843 --> 32:09.176
There you go.

32:17.477 --> 32:19.353
All right. Two hands on the wheel, buddy.

32:37.914 --> 32:39.248
Jesus, R!

32:40.667 --> 32:42.418
This was a beautiful car!

32:42.502 --> 32:43.544
Recalculating.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.399
What's with all the vinyl?

33:05.484 --> 33:07.085
Couldn't figure out how to work an iPod?

33:07.944 --> 33:11.238
Better sound.

33:12.074 --> 33:13.824
You're a purist?

33:14.159 --> 33:15.159
More

33:17.746 --> 33:18.788
alive.

33:18.997 --> 33:22.917
Yeah. That's true. Lot
more trouble, though.

33:24.086 --> 33:26.379
There you go again. Shrugging.

33:26.922 --> 33:28.798
Stop shrugging, shrugger.

33:29.132 --> 33:31.008
It's a very non-committal gesture.

33:32.886 --> 33:33.886
Really?

33:37.224 --> 33:40.101
These are really cool records.
How did you get all these?

33:41.186 --> 33:43.646
I collect things.

33:43.855 --> 33:47.900
Yeah, I can see that.
You, my friend, are a hoarder.

33:50.946 --> 33:54.407
Man, there's this awesome record store
on Main and lvy.

33:55.492 --> 33:57.076
You would love it. It's so cool.

33:58.620 --> 33:59.954
Was so cool.

34:02.541 --> 34:03.874
Alrighty.

34:08.672 --> 34:09.839
Much better.

35:42.307 --> 35:45.100
R? Can I ask you something?

35:48.313 --> 35:52.149
My boyfriend, he died back there.

35:52.901 --> 35:55.778
Will he come back? As one of you?

36:00.450 --> 36:02.117
That's good, I guess.

36:06.456 --> 36:08.207
Something happened to him.

36:10.293 --> 36:12.294
A lot of things happened to him.

36:13.004 --> 36:16.006
But I guess there just came a point where

36:16.591 --> 36:19.301
he couldn't absorb any more.

36:20.929 --> 36:24.932
It's just, in my world,
people die all the time.

36:26.226 --> 36:29.019
So... You know, it's not like.

36:29.104 --> 36:31.939
I'm not sad that he's gone.

36:33.233 --> 36:34.567
Because I am.

36:35.986 --> 36:37.278
But I think I've been

36:38.280 --> 36:42.283
preparing for it for a really long time.

37:26.119 --> 37:27.620
What are you?

37:44.137 --> 37:47.348
Man, it must be nice to sleep.
I wish I could.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.433
I wish I could dream.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.537
But that's not really an option for me.

37:52.270 --> 37:55.814
The dead don't dream.
This is as close as we get.

38:04.199 --> 38:05.532
You sure about this, son?

38:08.495 --> 38:09.536
Welcome, then.

38:13.875 --> 38:14.875
Sorry for your loss.

38:15.919 --> 38:17.002
Me, too.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.506
Give him one and show him how to use it.

38:25.011 --> 38:26.428
Hey, Berg, you gonna help us out or what?

38:26.554 --> 38:28.055
I'm almost at level five.

38:29.683 --> 38:30.724
Did you hear that?

38:32.227 --> 38:33.811
I did. We should bail.

38:33.895 --> 38:35.688
We can't just bail. We have orders.

38:37.774 --> 38:39.274
You sound just like my dad.

38:39.734 --> 38:41.568
- Thank you.
- Yeah, it wasn't a compliment.

38:41.695 --> 38:42.945
I told you I heard something.

38:44.239 --> 38:45.531
Perry!

38:46.533 --> 38:47.616
Aim for their heads.

39:59.856 --> 40:04.610
You said a few days.
It's been a few days, R.

40:06.446 --> 40:07.946
I have to go home.

40:10.992 --> 40:13.368
Stay together.

40:15.872 --> 40:17.289
Safe.

40:21.377 --> 40:22.461
What?

40:22.879 --> 40:24.213
Julie.

40:25.799 --> 40:26.840
Living.

40:28.301 --> 40:28.801
Eat!

40:44.317 --> 40:45.359
Oh, my God!

40:46.361 --> 40:47.528
We go.

40:50.532 --> 40:52.032
Eat.

40:53.368 --> 40:54.493
R. Look.

41:33.158 --> 41:34.158
This way.

41:52.468 --> 41:53.677
Come with me.

41:55.388 --> 41:56.430
What?

41:56.764 --> 41:57.806
No!

42:00.185 --> 42:01.810
Want to help her.

42:01.895 --> 42:02.978
Who the hell asked you?

42:04.689 --> 42:05.731
Like her.

42:10.111 --> 42:11.778
It's okay.

42:13.114 --> 42:14.281
I'm sure it is.

42:17.619 --> 42:19.453
- Over there, the garage.
- Hold on.

42:30.298 --> 42:32.591
I'm so happy to see you right now.

42:36.304 --> 42:37.596
You okay?

42:42.685 --> 42:44.144
R?

43:43.871 --> 43:45.289
You drive.

43:45.873 --> 43:47.207
Good idea.

44:15.236 --> 44:16.695
The white zone

44:16.779 --> 44:20.282
is for loading and unloading
of passengers only.

44:54.942 --> 44:56.777
Jesus, I'm freezing.

44:59.655 --> 45:00.947
I have to pull over.

45:03.409 --> 45:05.994
This is one of the last neighborhoods
my dad evacuated.

45:06.537 --> 45:08.413
Maybe these houses have food.

45:25.640 --> 45:26.890
Okay, come on.

45:30.812 --> 45:32.354
Oh, man. It's locked.

45:33.981 --> 45:35.816
Oh, God.

46:03.553 --> 46:05.011
Oh, cool!

46:06.806 --> 46:08.140
Look what they have.

46:08.516 --> 46:10.077
I haven't seen one of these in forever.

46:11.811 --> 46:12.894
Cheese!

46:16.149 --> 46:18.066
It's all right. See?

46:20.945 --> 46:21.987
Yeah.

46:23.030 --> 46:24.831
It's important to preserve memories,
you know?

46:26.075 --> 46:28.201
Especially now that
the world is on its way out.

46:32.915 --> 46:35.417
Everything you see,
you may be seeing for the last time.

46:36.627 --> 46:37.627
Perry used to say that.

46:40.173 --> 46:42.132
Here. Take a picture.

46:59.275 --> 47:00.567
I'm exhausted.

47:02.487 --> 47:05.822
The bed actually isn't too rotten,
so I'm gonna go to sleep.

47:07.158 --> 47:08.200
Good night.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.042
R?

47:17.543 --> 47:18.585
Yeah?

47:18.878 --> 47:21.004
I was... I was thinking...

47:22.798 --> 47:26.927
You know, you could sleep in there
if you want.

47:28.262 --> 47:29.304
On the floor.

47:31.098 --> 47:32.974
These houses creep me out, so...

47:36.354 --> 47:37.395
Okay.

48:44.130 --> 48:52.130
Do you feel it?

50:04.085 --> 50:05.585
Hey, look up this street.

50:05.795 --> 50:07.212
Holy shit. That's my dad.

50:08.255 --> 50:09.297
Get back!

50:17.473 --> 50:18.932
He would have killed you.

50:21.227 --> 50:23.388
If he saw you,
he would have just shot you in the head,

50:25.940 --> 50:27.649
and you'd just be gone.

50:33.781 --> 50:35.949
These clothes are soaking still.

50:38.119 --> 50:39.703
I'm gonna lay them out to dry.

50:42.123 --> 50:43.456
Oh, relax.

50:45.793 --> 50:47.210
Holy shit.

50:53.801 --> 50:54.968
Don't look.

50:56.095 --> 50:57.262
Okay.

51:00.808 --> 51:02.225
Holy shit!

51:12.778 --> 51:13.778
Hey.

51:15.948 --> 51:17.323
Do you have to eat people?

51:18.951 --> 51:19.993
Yeah.

51:20.661 --> 51:21.828
Or you'll die?

51:25.583 --> 51:27.751
- Yeah.
- But you didn't eat me.

51:30.421 --> 51:34.507
You rescued me. Like, a bunch.

51:39.638 --> 51:42.766
It must be hard being stuck in there.

51:43.309 --> 51:45.602
You know, I can see you trying.

51:45.686 --> 51:47.353
Maybe that's what people do.

51:48.230 --> 51:50.023
You know, we try to be better.

51:52.109 --> 51:54.277
Sometimes we kind of suck at it.

51:56.197 --> 51:58.406
But I look at you and

51:58.491 --> 52:02.660
you try so much harder
than any human in my city.

52:06.415 --> 52:08.166
You're a good person, R.

52:14.006 --> 52:15.048
Anyway.

52:16.550 --> 52:18.051
It was me.

52:20.513 --> 52:21.513
What was you?

52:45.412 --> 52:46.663
I mean, I...

52:48.082 --> 52:49.541
I guess I kind of knew that.

52:49.917 --> 52:51.251
You did?

52:55.339 --> 52:56.381
Yeah, I...

52:57.049 --> 52:58.883
I guess I hoped that you didn't.

53:02.096 --> 53:03.471
I'm sorry.

53:06.100 --> 53:07.725
Julie...

53:10.604 --> 53:13.731
I'm so sorry.

53:14.692 --> 53:15.942
Julie...

53:42.511 --> 53:43.970
The dead do not sleep.

54:04.783 --> 54:07.535
If you guys could pick
any job in the world...

54:08.329 --> 54:10.872
Pretend that everything
was totally different,

54:11.665 --> 54:12.957
what would you want to do?

54:16.670 --> 54:18.046
- Nursing.
- Yeah?

54:18.130 --> 54:21.841
Yeah. Healing people and

54:23.052 --> 54:24.886
saving lives and...

54:26.013 --> 54:28.598
I don't know, finding a cure.

54:30.017 --> 54:31.017
I like that.

54:31.727 --> 54:35.271
I think someday someone's gonna
figure out this whole thing and

54:35.356 --> 54:37.106
exhume the whole world.

54:37.232 --> 54:39.817
Exhume? And what does that mean?

54:41.779 --> 54:43.696
Exhume means to, like, revive.

54:43.822 --> 54:47.325
It means to dig up.
As in digging up a corpse.

54:48.535 --> 54:49.577
Whatever.

54:51.497 --> 54:53.081
What the hell are you doing here?

54:58.253 --> 55:00.088
Are you actually dreaming right now?

55:00.881 --> 55:01.923
I'm not sure.

55:02.216 --> 55:05.593
You can't dream, Corpse.
Dreaming is for humans.

55:05.678 --> 55:09.681
Chill out, Per. He can
dream if he wants to.

55:13.268 --> 55:14.268
What about you, R?

55:16.063 --> 55:17.230
What do you want to be?

55:17.731 --> 55:20.984
I don't know. I don't even know what I am.

55:21.110 --> 55:24.028
Well, you can be whatever you want.

55:24.113 --> 55:25.238
Isn't that what they say?

55:26.073 --> 55:28.366
We can, right? You and me?

55:29.910 --> 55:31.869
It's not gonna happen, loverboy.

55:32.246 --> 55:34.414
Not after you told her you ate her ex.

55:41.088 --> 55:42.255
Shrug.

56:42.274 --> 56:43.900
So much for dreaming.

56:43.984 --> 56:45.777
You can't be whatever you want.

56:45.861 --> 56:47.779
All I'll ever be is a slow, pale,

56:47.863 --> 56:49.530
hunched-over, dead-eyed zombie.

56:50.032 --> 56:51.074
What did I think was gonna happen?

56:51.158 --> 56:52.798
That she'd actually want to stay with me?

56:53.160 --> 56:56.120
It's hopeless.
This is what I get for wanting more.

56:56.205 --> 56:57.766
I should just be happy with what I had.

56:57.790 --> 57:00.583
Things don't change. I need to accept that.

57:00.667 --> 57:02.585
It's easier not to feel.

57:02.669 --> 57:04.253
Then I wouldn't have to feel like this.

58:08.902 --> 58:10.153
Identify yourself!

58:10.237 --> 58:12.446
It's just me, Kevin. It's okay. I'm fine.

58:12.531 --> 58:13.698
Just stop right there.

58:15.033 --> 58:17.160
It's okay. I'm not infected.

58:17.244 --> 58:18.661
I said stop, Julie!

58:20.247 --> 58:22.832
Okay. Fine. Fine.

58:23.667 --> 58:25.042
Let me check you out.

58:34.469 --> 58:36.012
- Is she okay?
- Clear, sir.

58:36.096 --> 58:37.138
Hi, Dad.

58:37.222 --> 58:39.682
I sent a half a dozen units
out looking for you.

58:39.766 --> 58:40.766
Nora said you were taken into...

58:40.851 --> 58:43.853
Yeah, I was. But I escaped.

58:43.937 --> 58:46.939
I was holed up in a house in the suburbs

58:47.024 --> 58:50.610
and then I found a car, so I came here.

58:51.111 --> 58:53.321
Julie, are you sure nothing bit you?

58:53.405 --> 58:54.906
Do I look infected to you, Dad?

58:55.240 --> 58:56.824
We have to be safe.

58:57.117 --> 58:59.744
Yeah, I know. I know.

58:59.828 --> 59:01.913
I'm fine, though. I promise.

59:03.916 --> 59:05.124
I thought I lost you.

59:07.294 --> 59:10.546
Well, you didn't, Dad. I'm here.

59:11.882 --> 59:13.174
Welcome home.

59:13.675 --> 59:15.843
Yeah. Good to be back.

59:34.029 --> 59:36.239
So I'm just gonna go home.
I'm gonna blend in.

59:36.323 --> 59:37.907
I'm gonna stop thinking so much.

59:38.325 --> 59:40.159
I'm gonna forget about her,

59:40.244 --> 59:42.203
just like I forgot about everything else.

59:42.287 --> 59:44.997
I'm gonna... Oh, shit, am I cold?

59:45.624 --> 59:48.918
Is that what this is?
Corpses don't get cold.

59:49.002 --> 59:50.336
Yo!

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:15.194
What are you doing here?

01:00:17.072 --> 01:00:19.532
Boneys. They chased me out.

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:22.576
Came to find you.

01:00:23.412 --> 01:00:24.453
Where is she?

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:26.289
Went home.

01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:36.549
You okay?

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:38.050
No.

01:00:48.562 --> 01:00:49.854
Bitches, man.

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:59.905
Boneys looking for you.

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:04.577
And her.

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:08.914
You started something.

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:13.461
I saw

01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:16.589
pictures

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:17.840
last night.

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.594
Memories.

01:01:23.055 --> 01:01:24.263
My mom...

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:27.600
Summertime.

01:01:29.269 --> 01:01:30.269
Cream

01:01:32.314 --> 01:01:33.356
of Wheat.

01:01:36.068 --> 01:01:37.109
A girl.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:38.569
A dream?

01:01:39.571 --> 01:01:40.905
A dream.

01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:44.700
We are changing, I think.

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.538
We are.

01:01:54.336 --> 01:01:55.836
I have to tell her.

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.133
Will you help?

01:02:04.805 --> 01:02:06.305
Help?

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:09.433
Exhume?

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:11.936
Exhume.

01:02:16.108 --> 01:02:17.149
They said:

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:21.028
"Fuck, yeah!"

01:02:54.146 --> 01:02:55.479
Wait here.

01:02:58.859 --> 01:03:01.861
Be careful. Okay?

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:10.703
So I'll wait here.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:37.980
It's not that bad. Come on.

01:03:58.293 --> 01:04:00.127
Julie and I were giving the others hope.

01:04:00.212 --> 01:04:01.795
And it was spreading fast.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.506
I guess the Boneys didn't like that.

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:05.758
That must be why they're looking for us.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:06.967
I have to tell Julie.

01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:10.221
I have to explain what's happening
before it's too late. I have to...

01:04:10.931 --> 01:04:14.016
Oh, no. Oh, no. Please, go!

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.893
Go with your friends! Leave me!

01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:17.311
That's it! Okay.

01:04:53.598 --> 01:04:57.476
No, I'm serious, Nora.
I mean, "Corpse" is just...

01:04:57.978 --> 01:04:59.895
It's just a stupid name
that we came up with

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:02.064
for a state of being
that we don't understand.

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:04.149
Yeah.

01:05:04.776 --> 01:05:06.151
Oh, my God!

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:09.321
What is wrong with me?

01:05:11.032 --> 01:05:12.157
Okay.

01:05:13.368 --> 01:05:14.660
I've got to tell you something.

01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:16.287
This is kind of weird.

01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:17.955
- Please do not freak out.
- No.

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:22.209
But I actually miss him.

01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:27.506
- You... You miss him?
- I know, it's so stupid.

01:05:27.632 --> 01:05:30.926
- Like you're attracted to him?
- No, I don't...

01:05:31.011 --> 01:05:33.345
Like he could be your boyfriend?

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:36.098
Your zombie boyfriend?

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:40.436
I mean, I know it's really hard
to meet guys right now

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:43.188
with the apocalypse and stuff, trust me.

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:45.649
And look, I know that you miss Perry.

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:48.068
Okay? But, Julie, this is weird.

01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:52.364
Like, I wish the Internet was still working
so I could just look up

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.366
whatever it is that's wrong with you.

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:55.784
Shut up.

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:57.953
All right.

01:05:58.204 --> 01:06:01.040
Okay. I'm getting ready for bed.

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:02.791
Hey.

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:05.544
I'm glad you're back.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.963
Yeah.

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:10.674
Have sweet dreams about your zombie.

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:12.551
All right.

01:06:50.757 --> 01:06:51.882
Julie.

01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:53.967
Julie!

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:56.428
Oh, my God.

01:06:58.890 --> 01:06:59.890
R!

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:03.268
What are you doing here?

01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:05.688
Came to see you.

01:07:07.107 --> 01:07:08.148
R...

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:13.028
You can't just do that. It's dangerous.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.657
Grigio, shut up! I'm trying to sleep!

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:18.450
Sorry!

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:22.788
Jesus, R, are you crazy?

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:26.083
The people here, they're not like me.

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:28.794
If they see you, you'll get killed.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.337
Do you understand that?

01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:33.132
Yes.

01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:35.801
- Are you talking to yourself?
- No!

01:07:36.261 --> 01:07:38.971
Okay, seriously,
what is going on out here, Julie?

01:07:42.642 --> 01:07:45.519
Oh, my God! Is that him?

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:48.105
Yeah.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:53.610
'Sup?

01:07:58.158 --> 01:07:59.575
I'm sorry.

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:04.621
I know. I'm sorry, too.

01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:15.215
I actually missed you.

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:18.426
Me, too.

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:23.474
It's funny. You feel
warmer than I remember.

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:31.148
That's the patrol.
Come on, we better get you inside.

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:39.156
Come on.

01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:42.701
You're lucky my dad
got pulled into some emergency thing.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.912
You're safe here tonight, R.

01:08:46.915 --> 01:08:49.625
After that, I don't know
what we're gonna do.

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:52.877
How did you die?

01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:56.506
I don't remember.

01:08:56.591 --> 01:08:57.674
How old are you?

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:02.095
Because you could be twenty-something,
but you could also be a teenager.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:04.096
- You have one of those faces.
- Oh, my God.

01:09:04.724 --> 01:09:06.517
And I can't even smell...
You don't smell...

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.600
He doesn't smell rotten.

01:09:08.937 --> 01:09:10.895
- I don't...
- Amazing.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:14.233
Nora, he didn't come here
for an interview. Stop.

01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:23.283
Why did you come here, R?

01:09:25.245 --> 01:09:28.121
To show everyone...

01:09:28.206 --> 01:09:29.331
Show them what?

01:09:29.415 --> 01:09:31.750
That we can change.

01:09:33.545 --> 01:09:35.504
R, no one here is ever gonna buy that.

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:38.465
Not that we could get you
even close enough to tell them.

01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:41.176
As soon as they saw you,
they would blow your head to bits.

01:09:42.886 --> 01:09:45.764
Wait a minute. Did you say "we"?

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:48.850
Lots of us changing.

01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:51.478
Dreaming.

01:09:52.897 --> 01:09:54.481
That's kind of a big deal.

01:09:54.649 --> 01:09:56.441
We have to move fast.

01:09:56.651 --> 01:09:57.818
What do you mean?

01:09:57.902 --> 01:10:02.114
Boneys chasing me. They're chasing us.

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:03.699
Okay, we have to go to my dad.

01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:05.826
No, that is a very bad idea.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:07.953
No, Nora, he was a reasonable guy once.

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:10.247
Oh, no, I think you're confused.

01:10:10.331 --> 01:10:12.207
It was your mom that
was the reasonable one.

01:10:12.292 --> 01:10:15.210
It was your dad that grounded you for
a year for stealing Peach Schnapps.

01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:19.214
Are you serious? It's your dad
that likes to shoot Corpses in the head.

01:10:19.299 --> 01:10:21.425
Well, what other choice do we have, Nora?

01:10:22.302 --> 01:10:24.344
Still, we'd have to get
him through the city.

01:10:24.429 --> 01:10:25.971
Someone would definitely see you.

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:27.389
There isn't much time.

01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:30.267
We could fix him up.

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:32.144
What?

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:34.104
I have some makeup
that I was saving for a special occasion

01:10:34.188 --> 01:10:35.549
that obviously isn't gonna happen.

01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:40.986
Yeah. Yeah, we could.

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:44.239
We could put on a little bit of foundation,

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:49.119
maybe a little blush.
Probably a lot of blush.

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:50.996
No way.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.498
Yeah, way.

01:11:00.048 --> 01:11:01.673
Would you change the song, please?

01:11:03.635 --> 01:11:04.843
What? It's funny.

01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:07.512
No, it's not.

01:11:10.391 --> 01:11:11.433
Fine.

01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:46.593
There we go.

01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:49.429
Oh, yeah.

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:00.899
Hold up...

01:12:02.193 --> 01:12:03.735
You look hot!

01:12:57.999 --> 01:12:59.166
What?

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:00.459
Nothing.

01:13:01.294 --> 01:13:03.670
It's just, you look nice.

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:10.285
I don't know how my dad's gonna be.

01:13:10.303 --> 01:13:12.763
He gets kind of crazy. This might not work.

01:13:13.139 --> 01:13:14.139
Hey.

01:13:15.183 --> 01:13:17.851
No matter what, we stay together.

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:21.229
We're changing everything.

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:23.982
I know.

01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:28.153
Stay together. Promise.

01:13:29.614 --> 01:13:30.697
I promise.

01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:33.492
Come on.

01:13:34.619 --> 01:13:38.288
Hey, it's game time. All
right, let's do this.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:40.457
Excuse me.

01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:43.960
Where are you guys headed?

01:13:44.045 --> 01:13:45.128
To see my dad, Kevin.

01:13:45.213 --> 01:13:46.922
Miss Grigio, I can't let you guys in.

01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:48.507
We're on high alert around here.

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:51.927
- Why? What's going on?
- It's classified.

01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:53.887
All right, well,
we have our own classified business,

01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:54.971
so come on.

01:13:57.433 --> 01:14:00.227
Hey.

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:02.646
Say something human.
Say something human.

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.106
How are you?

01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:06.399
Nailed it.

01:14:06.484 --> 01:14:07.901
Over here. He's fine.

01:14:27.922 --> 01:14:29.548
Okay, you guys wait here.

01:14:42.436 --> 01:14:43.562
What are you doing here?

01:14:44.105 --> 01:14:46.314
What is going on? What is all this?

01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:47.732
I'm not sure, but it's not good.

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:50.402
We've been getting reports

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:53.446
there are sizable packs
of skeletons and Corpses

01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:54.573
coming toward us.

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:56.658
We don't know why,
but if they're here to attack,

01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:58.142
there's nothing we can do about it.

01:14:58.202 --> 01:14:59.953
Too many of them, too few of us.

01:15:00.037 --> 01:15:02.831
So I want you to get home,
lock down the house.

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:05.542
I have the gun there, the Ruger SR...

01:15:05.626 --> 01:15:09.546
This? Yeah, okay. I need to talk to you.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:12.048
- Julie, not now.
- Dad, it's important.

01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:16.219
This is gonna sound really crazy, but

01:15:16.304 --> 01:15:20.432
I think the dead are coming back to life.

01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:22.851
That does sound crazy.

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:24.811
They're changing, Dad. They're...

01:15:24.896 --> 01:15:27.355
I don't know.
They're somehow curing themselves.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.649
You think they're curing themselves?
How is that?

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:32.861
I saw it. It is really happening.

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:34.988
No. You know what is happening, Julie?

01:15:35.114 --> 01:15:37.699
What's happening is every day
there are more of them and less of us.

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:39.576
They are not curing themselves.

01:15:39.911 --> 01:15:41.369
We're their food source.

01:15:41.454 --> 01:15:45.457
They are not becoming vegan.
Okay? They don't eat broccoli.

01:15:45.625 --> 01:15:49.252
They eat brains, your mother's
and your boyfriend's included.

01:15:49.462 --> 01:15:52.464
Okay? So I want you to wake up!

01:15:52.673 --> 01:15:54.424
- I'll explain.
- Okay?

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:57.302
What do you mean, "you'll explain"?
Explain what?

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:58.470
I got this.

01:15:58.596 --> 01:15:59.721
Get yourself home.

01:15:59.805 --> 01:16:02.015
Barricade yourself in the shelter.

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:04.309
There is enough stuff there
that you can open up...

01:16:08.147 --> 01:16:09.189
Hi.

01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:13.193
Who are you?

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:15.195
This is R.

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:20.992
I didn't ask you. I asked him. Who are you?

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:30.085
You're a Corpse?

01:16:31.212 --> 01:16:32.671
He saved my life.

01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:35.674
He took care of me.

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:39.511
I triggered something in him

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:42.305
and that must have sparked
something in all of them...

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:45.141
- Now it's triggered something in me.
- No...

01:16:45.226 --> 01:16:47.102
Dad! No! Dad!

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:48.687
We want to help.

01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:52.565
Please, they don't want to attack us.
They want to help.

01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:54.109
We're... We're getting better.

01:16:54.193 --> 01:16:57.112
No. Things don't get better.
Things get worse.

01:16:57.196 --> 01:17:00.865
People get bit, then they get infected,
then I shoot them in the head.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:01.950
- No, Dad...
- That's what happened

01:17:02.034 --> 01:17:04.577
to your mother,
and that's what's gonna happen to him.

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:07.539
I'm really sorry, Mr. Grigio.

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:14.004
Go. Get out of here and be safe,
no matter what. Okay?

01:17:15.423 --> 01:17:16.464
Julie...

01:17:16.549 --> 01:17:17.632
I have to go.

01:17:22.388 --> 01:17:24.139
You're not gonna shoot me.

01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:26.808
Yes. Yeah, I will. Totally.

01:17:38.362 --> 01:17:40.363
Okay. That could have gone better.

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:44.075
I need to warn my friends.

01:17:44.994 --> 01:17:46.328
- Where?
- The stadium...

01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:53.251
Shit! Come on! Get on the subway!

01:18:47.264 --> 01:18:51.976
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry.

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:57.732
Coming through.

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:03.696
R.

01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:09.035
Julie.

01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:10.537
Hi.

01:19:10.955 --> 01:19:14.249
Ready for a fight.

01:19:14.542 --> 01:19:15.959
Yeah, I can see that.

01:19:16.043 --> 01:19:20.004
Soldiers coming. Boneys closing in.

01:19:31.892 --> 01:19:33.184
They're here now.

01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:37.814
- Keep them out.
- We will.

01:19:41.569 --> 01:19:42.569
Run.

01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:30.742
This way, come on!

01:20:34.288 --> 01:20:36.831
Sir, your daughter is with the Corpse.

01:20:36.916 --> 01:20:37.999
I've got eyes on them.

01:22:13.804 --> 01:22:14.846
Thank you.

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:32.864
Who the hell do we shoot?

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:34.782
This asshole.

01:22:37.995 --> 01:22:39.037
Hi.

01:22:44.376 --> 01:22:47.462
Hey. Hi. Hi.

01:22:50.049 --> 01:22:52.050
We see Corpses fighting skeletons, sir.

01:22:54.136 --> 01:22:56.471
Copy that. We're seeing
that over here, too.

01:22:58.515 --> 01:22:59.974
Sorry, can you repeat that?

01:23:00.059 --> 01:23:02.935
Copy that. We're seeing
Corpses fighting skeletons, sir.

01:23:07.066 --> 01:23:08.107
Shit!

01:23:28.337 --> 01:23:29.379
It's over.

01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:32.423
No. Keep you safe.

01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:35.593
It will be okay.

01:24:08.127 --> 01:24:09.127
R?

01:24:31.442 --> 01:24:32.483
R!

01:24:32.985 --> 01:24:34.944
R, please?

01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:37.697
You okay?

01:24:38.157 --> 01:24:39.449
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:33.836
Next one's the head.
Move away from him, Julie.

01:25:34.546 --> 01:25:35.546
No!

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:37.340
Julie, move now.

01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:39.717
Dad, you have to listen to me.

01:25:40.844 --> 01:25:42.428
I know we lost everybody.

01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:47.183
I know you lost Mom.
But you and me, we are still here.

01:25:49.228 --> 01:25:52.480
We can fix all this. We can start over.

01:25:53.232 --> 01:25:54.524
They need our help.

01:25:56.235 --> 01:25:59.111
Please, Dad! Look at him.

01:25:59.738 --> 01:26:01.739
He's different. He's...

01:26:05.786 --> 01:26:06.911
Bleeding.

01:26:09.414 --> 01:26:11.082
He's bleeding, Dad.

01:26:14.795 --> 01:26:16.462
Corpses don't bleed!

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:19.090
Oh, God.

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.261
You're alive. He's alive!

01:26:26.265 --> 01:26:27.431
You're alive.

01:26:30.269 --> 01:26:31.394
Does it hurt?

01:26:32.271 --> 01:26:33.354
Yeah.

01:26:34.398 --> 01:26:35.439
Yeah?

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:38.651
Sir?

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:03.801
This is Colonel Grigio.
The situation has changed.

01:27:14.438 --> 01:27:16.480
Let's get you two the hell out of here.

01:27:41.131 --> 01:27:42.632
Are you still bleeding?

01:27:44.676 --> 01:27:46.677
- Yes.
- Good.

01:27:48.013 --> 01:27:49.263
Sorry.

01:27:50.307 --> 01:27:52.767
On the one hand,
getting shot in the chest hurt.

01:27:52.851 --> 01:27:53.976
Like, a lot.

01:27:54.353 --> 01:27:58.439
But on the other,
it felt good to bleed, to feel pain.

01:27:58.523 --> 01:27:59.523
To feel love.

01:28:02.778 --> 01:28:04.987
I wish I could say
we cured the Boneys with love,

01:28:05.822 --> 01:28:08.199
but really, we just straight
up killed them all.

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:11.494
It sounds kind of messed up,
but no one felt too bad about it.

01:28:11.578 --> 01:28:13.621
They were too far gone to change.

01:28:14.373 --> 01:28:17.625
It was actually a really good bonding
experience for us and the humans.

01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:19.877
Once we joined forces,
they didn't stand a chance.

01:28:24.049 --> 01:28:26.592
The ones we didn't kill just wasted away.

01:28:28.011 --> 01:28:29.929
And the rest of us?

01:28:30.013 --> 01:28:32.223
Well, we kind of learned how to live again.

01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:37.812
For a while, it seemed like
a lot of us forgot what that meant.

01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:53.744
The humans began to accept us,
connect with us, teach us.

01:28:55.247 --> 01:28:56.956
This was the key to the cure.

01:29:01.086 --> 01:29:03.004
It was scary at first, but

01:29:03.088 --> 01:29:06.382
every great thing starts out
a little scary, doesn't it?

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:23.315
This is how it happened.

01:29:26.945 --> 01:29:28.612
This is how the world was

01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:30.698
exhumed.

01:29:45.297 --> 01:29:46.630
You need some help?

01:29:47.966 --> 01:29:49.008
Yeah.

01:29:49.468 --> 01:29:52.470
I have zombie fingers.

01:29:54.723 --> 01:29:55.765
Thank you.

01:29:59.936 --> 01:30:00.978
Here.

01:30:01.396 --> 01:30:03.647
Oh, it's okay. I don't mind the rain.

01:30:03.815 --> 01:30:04.815
I insist.

01:30:07.486 --> 01:30:08.486
I'm...

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:13.407
Marcus.

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.243
Emily.

01:30:20.665 --> 01:30:22.583
You're... You're very pretty.

01:30:24.503 --> 01:30:26.045
Thank you, Marcus.

01:30:26.588 --> 01:30:29.673
Now you're supposed to say I'm pretty, too.

01:30:34.679 --> 01:30:35.763
R?

01:30:36.306 --> 01:30:37.348
Yeah?

01:30:37.808 --> 01:30:39.475
Do you remember your name yet?

01:30:40.477 --> 01:30:41.519
No.

01:30:43.146 --> 01:30:45.564
Well, you know,
you could just give yourself one.

01:30:46.316 --> 01:30:48.901
Just pick one. Whatever you want.

01:30:52.322 --> 01:30:53.405
I like "R."

01:30:54.616 --> 01:30:55.699
Really?

01:30:57.327 --> 01:30:59.161
You don't want to know what it was?

01:31:00.038 --> 01:31:01.956
You don't want your old life back?

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.290
No.

01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:05.793
I want this one.

01:31:13.301 --> 01:31:14.885
Just "R," huh?

01:31:16.346 --> 01:31:17.555
Just "R."
