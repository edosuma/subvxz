00:33.198 --> 00:36.833
- Whoo! Show me them legs!
- Shelby?

00:37.770 --> 00:41.233
Mm! So many legs!
That griz is unreal!

00:44.210 --> 00:45.602
Hey, dancing bug!

00:45.696 --> 00:49.873
- Uh, come on, man! Shake it.
- No. I really couldn't... Okay!

00:49.967 --> 00:54.142
- Maybe I could.
- Whoa, dang, DB!

00:54.236 --> 00:56.797
- You're the best bug at this party.
- What?

00:56.891 --> 00:58.490
Hey, I've got moves, too, guys.

00:58.584 --> 01:00.509
Yeah, right, Shelby.
What are you gonna do?

01:00.603 --> 01:05.495
- The worm?
- No. Um... I'm gonna do parkour.

01:05.589 --> 01:08.342
- Hmm.
- Haha.

01:08.878 --> 01:13.267
Parkour!
I'm doing parkour! Oop!

01:14.662 --> 01:18.582
Ah! Oh, no!
I really hurt myself.

01:19.736 --> 01:22.006
Guys, I'm so dumb!

01:25.557 --> 01:27.446
Ugh!

01:28.603 --> 01:31.659
Hey, somebody
forgot their... Oh, cram!

01:33.858 --> 01:37.018
- Um... Who are you?
- Pbht!

01:37.086 --> 01:38.792
Oh! There's... There's a note.

01:38.903 --> 01:41.528
"Hey, dude! The tip of your tail
got snipped off,

01:41.622 --> 01:46.346
so now you have a little brother.
We named him Butty Butterson.

01:46.457 --> 01:51.395
Signed, the other bugs."
I'll call you Kent for short.

01:53.562 --> 01:56.541
Jake.
Jake!

01:56.635 --> 02:01.465
Hmm? Whoa! Shelby.
What's going on there?

02:01.609 --> 02:05.415
- With your butt?
- It's fine. I was goofing off, got hurt.

02:05.509 --> 02:07.675
Now I got a little brother.
I named him Kent.

02:07.769 --> 02:08.916
I'm Kent.

02:09.020 --> 02:13.162
- Whoa! A talking brother!
- You can chop up a worm and get two?

02:13.256 --> 02:14.608
I thought that was a myth.

02:14.702 --> 02:17.039
Myth is a powerful
force in my life, dude.

02:17.133 --> 02:20.074
So, the thing is, I don't know
beans about being a big brother.

02:20.168 --> 02:21.369
Can you give me some tips?

02:21.463 --> 02:23.618
Ah, it's easy.
You just give him some

02:23.712 --> 02:25.397
sharp thing and get
him to fight bad guys.

02:25.491 --> 02:26.508
That's it?

02:26.576 --> 02:29.297
Yeah, you might have to stretch
all big if he gets in real trouble.

02:29.391 --> 02:32.044
- But, yeah.
- All right. Sounds good.

02:32.384 --> 02:34.960
Someday, you'll be Kent's food.

02:39.945 --> 02:41.726
Oh, wow!

02:42.940 --> 02:46.310
- Hey, how did you do that?
- I don't know.

02:46.460 --> 02:49.776
Hmm. Okay, Kent.
This is for real important.

02:49.870 --> 02:50.965
You are my little brother,

02:51.059 --> 02:53.176
so your purpose is to fight bad guys.

02:53.270 --> 02:54.742
So go fight some bad guys!

02:54.836 --> 02:58.946
- Or girls. Don't discriminate.
- Oh! Okay, brother.

02:59.040 --> 03:03.458
Boo-oop! Boop, boop, boop,
boop, boop, boop, boop!

03:05.934 --> 03:07.493
Hyah!

03:14.578 --> 03:16.578
Ohhh!

03:17.408 --> 03:18.948
A bad guy.

03:19.099 --> 03:21.133
Hey! Let's fight!

03:24.437 --> 03:26.024
Hey! Get back here!

03:26.118 --> 03:28.909
Don't run!
I'm super new at fights.

03:29.003 --> 03:30.828
And at being alive.

03:38.401 --> 03:40.478
- Hi!
- Who are you?

03:42.326 --> 03:45.201
Where am I?
Why do my parts hurt?

03:45.295 --> 03:47.573
Oh, good! You're awake.

03:47.667 --> 03:51.567
I'm-I am Leaf Beard.
I found you blonked out and

03:51.661 --> 03:55.530
bruised in the tunnels.
But if you drink of our dewdrops,

03:55.624 --> 03:58.997
- it will fix up all your ouchies.
- Oh!

04:01.084 --> 04:02.396
Pbht!

04:03.851 --> 04:06.153
The Rat King has made
his way to our end

04:06.247 --> 04:08.641
of the roots.
You should be more careful.

04:08.735 --> 04:11.615
Oh! Oh, okay.
What's a Rat King?

04:11.747 --> 04:15.433
Oh! You're not from the roots.

04:15.527 --> 04:17.802
I'm from my brother's butt.
Maybe.

04:17.896 --> 04:22.912
The Rat King's been destroying our home,
chewing up the roots of this tree.

04:23.006 --> 04:27.180
This tree that gives us life!
Life!

04:27.274 --> 04:30.538
- Hey!
- So, he's a bad guy?

04:30.632 --> 04:32.811
So sick nasty bad.

04:32.912 --> 04:35.659
That means I got to fight him.
That's what my brother said to do!

04:35.753 --> 04:38.179
- Where's my sword?
- Your sword was shattered to

04:38.273 --> 04:41.346
- butts when I found you.
- Oh... Bummer.

04:41.414 --> 04:42.456
Yes.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.712
- Bums.
- What do I do?

04:44.806 --> 04:49.540
Um... I don't know. But the blacksmith
could make you a new one, probably.

04:49.634 --> 04:54.793
That's who I am. And I am very good at me.
Okay, so, like, the Rat King has been

04:54.887 --> 04:57.525
messing up the roots, yeah? Chewing on them
with his teeth.

04:57.619 --> 04:59.089
The sword has to be made of

04:59.183 --> 05:02.418
the strongest tree stuff so even his teeth
can't break it!

05:02.512 --> 05:03.713
Bring me the freshest

05:03.807 --> 05:05.434
ingredients and I'll do it up.

05:05.804 --> 05:08.007
Follow
the sound of the singing crystal.

05:08.101 --> 05:11.168
- There you'll find the first element.
- Boo!

05:11.262 --> 05:17.985
- Cool, cool. Ha!
- Greetings.

05:18.079 --> 05:22.595
Hey, man! I'm looking for some
unbreakable ore. Y'all got that here?

05:22.689 --> 05:26.725
I have what you seek.
But consider this instead.

05:26.979 --> 05:30.874
I offer you this treasure of glittering
emeralds.

05:30.968 --> 05:32.970
You'll be infinitely rich

05:33.064 --> 05:36.315
and live the rest of your days in comfort.

05:36.694 --> 05:37.823
No, I'm good.

05:37.917 --> 05:39.336
Just the ore, please.

05:39.430 --> 05:42.740
Oooh! Well done.
By resisting the temptation

05:42.834 --> 05:45.411
of wealth, you
have passed my test.

05:45.505 --> 05:47.330
Nah, I just don't
care about money.

05:47.424 --> 05:49.929
My name's Kent.
I'm supposed to fight bad guys.

05:50.023 --> 05:56.463
All right. That's pretty weird, but...
Here you go... The unbreakable ore.

05:58.422 --> 06:02.379
- Uh... Could you just...
- Yeah.

06:02.473 --> 06:05.049
- Oh, there. There she goes!
- Ha, ha!

06:06.684 --> 06:10.183
Boop, boop, ba-doop, ba-doop,
ba-doop, boop, boop, boop.

06:10.990 --> 06:12.329
Whoop, whoop!

06:12.683 --> 06:15.942
Greetings.
Come to fight me, eh?

06:16.066 --> 06:19.685
My name is Kent, and if I had
a sword, I'd totally fight you.

06:19.784 --> 06:22.600
But for now, I'm looking
for a clod of mystic earth.

06:22.841 --> 06:26.936
Yes. I have what you seek.
But consider this instead.

06:27.531 --> 06:30.858
I offer you the hand of one of my beautiful
daughters.

06:30.952 --> 06:32.576
You'll become a good husband

06:32.670 --> 06:35.302
and live the rest of
your days in true love.

06:35.961 --> 06:37.280
Nah, I don't care about being

06:37.374 --> 06:39.705
a good husband or
wife or whatever.

06:39.799 --> 06:42.451
All's I care about is
fighting bad guys!

06:42.545 --> 06:44.555
Dang, homes, that's cold.

06:47.029 --> 06:50.899
Here you go. Mystic earth.

07:03.652 --> 07:06.707
- Greetings.
- Dude, you know why I'm here!

07:06.801 --> 07:12.159
Yeah. And I got what you want.
But consider this instead. Hyah!

07:12.327 --> 07:17.696
Drink this sap, and you'll have life
eternal. You'll never meet death and

07:17.790 --> 07:19.820
you'll outlast the world.

07:20.197 --> 07:22.813
Um... I was born earlier today,

07:22.907 --> 07:26.656
so I don't really get a sense of
my own mortality. No, thank you.

07:26.929 --> 07:32.007
Hyah!
The sacred flame.

07:35.772 --> 07:37.756
Oh, what?

07:45.160 --> 07:48.929
I name this sword...
Punch party!

07:56.705 --> 07:59.935
I feel so cool right now.

08:02.243 --> 08:07.204
- It's party time. Whoa! Uh!
- Greetings.

08:07.298 --> 08:13.976
- Who's there?
- I am the Rat King. Why are you here?

08:14.070 --> 08:18.528
I-I've got, like, this rad sword, and...
I'm gonna fight you with it.

08:29.899 --> 08:31.116
Yes!

08:31.431 --> 08:35.457
Who are you fighting me for?
Your brother?

08:35.551 --> 08:39.996
- What?
- Instead, why don't you join me?

08:40.615 --> 08:43.414
I offer you cosmic power.

08:43.508 --> 08:48.138
You'll be a king and live the rest of
your days as a God.

08:48.239 --> 08:52.077
You're messing up the tree, and
I totally live here! You're a bad guy!

08:53.267 --> 08:54.564
Yeah.

08:58.091 --> 08:59.871
Don't do that!

09:01.830 --> 09:04.250
How do you plan to defeat me?

09:04.360 --> 09:09.034
I'm... Making... This...
Up... As I go!

09:14.369 --> 09:17.954

10:26.776 --> 10:27.952

10:29.604 --> 10:32.606
Kent proceeded to relate
his fantastic journey to me.

10:32.674 --> 10:35.977
It was all super good.
But he had also partaken of the

10:36.071 --> 10:37.785
food of the underworld,

10:37.972 --> 10:41.444
and so he was compelled to return
there by dewdrop law.

10:41.538 --> 10:43.221
That's what he said, at least.

10:43.315 --> 10:46.321
Maybe he was having second thoughts
about infinite riches,

10:46.415 --> 10:48.934
true love, and eternal life.
Or maybe he had

10:49.028 --> 10:52.952
just decided that fighting bad guys
wasn't really his deal.

10:54.061 --> 10:57.834
But I do know this...
Free from the Rat King's cursed teeth,

10:57.945 --> 11:01.107
that spring, for the
first time in many years,

11:01.201 --> 11:03.635
the Willow
Tree was in bloom.
