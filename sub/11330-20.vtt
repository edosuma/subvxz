00:23.349 --> 00:24.049
Hello, Betty.

00:24.050 --> 00:27.423
I'm sure you and Leo have a lot to talk about.
So, good night, Leo.

00:29.111 --> 00:30.085
Do you know what time it is?

00:30.086 --> 00:31.538
Dylan just wanted to see the butcher shop.

00:31.539 --> 00:33.178
It was a mistake to get married,

00:33.179 --> 00:36.364
and I don't want to follow
my husband to Africa.

00:36.365 --> 00:38.079
How did you ever marry that woman?

00:38.080 --> 00:39.025
Betty was good to me.

00:39.026 --> 00:41.533
I want to have children.
Just think about it.

00:41.534 --> 00:43.711
I don't want to push you,
but I want to get married.

00:43.712 --> 00:44.382
If we get married,

00:44.383 --> 00:46.571
there's always a chance that
we could get a divorce.

00:46.572 --> 00:48.830
License and registration please.

00:50.825 --> 00:52.964
Son, this is a fishing license.

00:53.948 --> 00:55.494
I had such a nice time tonight.

00:55.495 --> 00:57.418
I'm sure my parents are in bed.

00:58.303 --> 00:59.629
Gotcha!

01:03.567 --> 01:05.825
Nora! Nora, wake up, I need some help.

01:06.505 --> 01:09.006
Help with what? What's going on?

01:09.195 --> 01:11.617
Is it a heart attack? Are
you having a heart attack?

01:11.618 --> 01:13.181
No, I'm not having a heart attack.

01:13.182 --> 01:14.574
I have to go pick up Kathleen.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.595
Her son, Tom, got caught
driving without a license.

01:18.647 --> 01:19.790
She wants me to go down there with her.

01:19.791 --> 01:20.965
What do you need my help with?

01:20.966 --> 01:22.789
It's the middle of the
night, I can't wake up Robbie

01:22.790 --> 01:24.599
and take him down to the police
station in the middle of the night.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.023
You're gonna have to babysit. Oh, no.

01:27.312 --> 01:28.570
I don't babysit.

01:28.618 --> 01:30.405
No one lets me babysit, ever.

01:30.406 --> 01:33.336
I'll go pick up Kathleen and
go to the police station.

01:34.374 --> 01:36.302
Yeah, that's probably a bad idea.

01:36.303 --> 01:38.116
I'm sure you'll be just fine with Robie.

01:38.117 --> 01:39.507
No, no, that's not the point,

01:39.508 --> 01:41.265
the point is nobody trusts me with Robie.

01:41.266 --> 01:44.962
If Robie accidentally fell and hit
his head when I'm babysitting,

01:44.963 --> 01:45.607
I'd go to prison.

01:45.608 --> 01:47.119
He's not gonna hit his head.

01:47.120 --> 01:49.302
Go sleep in my bed, here's the monitor.

01:50.069 --> 01:51.685
Get in there. You can do it!

01:51.799 --> 01:55.782
All right, all right, I can do it.
I can do it.

01:56.355 --> 01:58.237
But when Anne finds out
you've let me do it,

01:58.238 --> 02:00.298
she may never let you keep the kid again.

02:00.299 --> 02:01.263
You're right, you're right.

02:01.264 --> 02:02.783
Thanks for pointing that out.

02:03.904 --> 02:04.859
You have to go where?

02:04.860 --> 02:06.271
Tom is down at the police station

02:06.272 --> 02:07.707
and Kathleen needs me to go down there.

02:07.708 --> 02:09.422
So you want me to get up
in the middle of the night

02:09.423 --> 02:12.301
and leave my own son so you
can go help Wife Number One?

02:12.302 --> 02:13.425
What's going on?

02:14.143 --> 02:16.455
Let me speak to Ricky. No!

02:16.769 --> 02:17.992
Was that your dad?

02:18.024 --> 02:20.935
Yeah, Kathleen has a family
emergency, she needs him.

02:20.936 --> 02:24.078
So, he wants me to go over
there and watch Robie.

02:24.118 --> 02:25.161
I can go over there.

02:25.162 --> 02:26.162
No. He can't just drop

02:26.163 --> 02:28.271
his old life and start a new one so easily.

02:28.272 --> 02:29.646
Let him figure it out.

02:34.085 --> 02:36.490
I have no choice. I have to
leave Robie in your care.

02:36.491 --> 02:39.793
And I can do that because I
absolutely trust you with my son.

02:39.794 --> 02:40.581
You're not a drug addict,

02:40.582 --> 02:42.417
you're not an alcoholic,
you're not a criminal.

02:42.418 --> 02:43.812
You've served your time,

02:43.813 --> 02:46.985
you've paid your debt to society,
and now you can babysit.

02:46.986 --> 02:49.270
In an emergency. In the
middle of the night.

02:50.007 --> 02:51.561
Never mind, I can't do it.

02:55.621 --> 02:57.314
Uh, hi, Kathleen.

02:57.315 --> 03:00.309
George, it's okay, I can't
wait any longer, I have to go.

03:00.310 --> 03:03.113
I'm just gonna take a taxi so I
can drive Rachel's car home.

03:03.114 --> 03:04.783
Thank heavens they didn't impound the car.

03:04.784 --> 03:05.937
Why can't Rachel go with you?

03:05.938 --> 03:07.230
Same reason you can't,

03:07.231 --> 03:09.173
she has children and it's
2:00 in the morning.

03:09.174 --> 03:11.193
You know I'd be there if I could. I tried.

03:11.194 --> 03:13.534
George, it's okay, it's really okay.

03:13.535 --> 03:14.190
I mean, I think I better

03:14.191 --> 03:16.711
get used to the idea of
taking care of myself.

03:16.958 --> 03:19.587
Well, your husband will be
coming home at some point.

03:19.588 --> 03:22.389
Uh, no. I talked to him.

03:22.625 --> 03:23.549
You talked to him?

03:23.550 --> 03:25.200
It's over. And...

03:25.414 --> 03:28.681
George, I can't talk about this right now.
I have to go.

03:37.723 --> 03:38.650
Hi, Anne.

03:38.651 --> 03:40.508
George? How are you?

03:40.509 --> 03:42.618
Is Robie okay? Did he wake you up?

03:42.619 --> 03:45.388
No, no, I... I just couldn't sleep.

03:45.389 --> 03:46.393
Ashley and I are shopping.

03:46.394 --> 03:48.443
She's trying on this unbelievable dress.

03:48.444 --> 03:50.049
We're having such a great time.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.108
Speaking the language, huh?

03:55.109 --> 03:58.143
Yeah, it's been great to
brush up on my French.

03:58.758 --> 04:00.974
But you're not just calling to say hello.

04:00.975 --> 04:02.079
What's going on?

04:02.100 --> 04:05.551
We're never gonna get back together
again, are we? You and me.

04:06.110 --> 04:07.767
No, I don't think so.

04:08.634 --> 04:10.931
But do we really need to
discuss this right now

04:10.932 --> 04:12.811
in the middle of the night for some reason?

04:12.812 --> 04:16.678
No, no need to discuss it at all.I'm done.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.331
I just wanted to say that.
I can't do it anymore.

04:19.332 --> 04:22.141
Well, I think we've both said
that a couple dozen times before.

04:22.575 --> 04:25.708
Yeah, and, uh, that's part of the reason,

04:26.530 --> 04:28.947
I just can't do it anymore, Anne.
I'm sorry.

04:29.105 --> 04:32.995
Um... This is it.

04:49.031 --> 04:50.084
What's going on?

04:50.196 --> 04:51.247
Lots of things.

04:51.248 --> 04:53.094
Lots of things that couldn't
wait until I got up?

04:53.095 --> 04:55.776
I haven't been to bed yet. Okay.

04:55.777 --> 04:58.409
Grace, I want you to Jacob this weekend.

04:58.410 --> 04:59.552
Okay, you didn't to tell me that over

04:59.553 --> 05:01.651
because I was gonna do it anyway.

05:01.652 --> 05:05.357
I was just waiting and when I felt like it.

05:07.049 --> 05:08.215
Why? Did something happen?

05:08.216 --> 05:10.647
Please do not tell me or sister somewhere.

05:10.648 --> 05:12.972
No, he doesn't, but something happened.

05:13.385 --> 05:17.481
Tom attempted to drive Jacob over
to your condo to talk to you.

05:17.482 --> 05:20.956
I wasn't home. Wait. That Tom drove?

05:20.957 --> 05:23.399
Rachel's new car. And they got lost.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.987
And a police officer onto a vacant lot.

05:25.988 --> 05:27.606
Then I got a call from the police station

05:27.607 --> 05:29.754
00 in the morning to come and get them.

05:29.755 --> 05:32.171
Thankfully, They just gave him a warning.

05:32.172 --> 05:33.459
The police officer knew your dad.

05:33.460 --> 05:35.324
Was it a woman police officer?

05:35.325 --> 05:37.368
Grace, do you understand
what I'm telling you?

05:37.369 --> 05:39.586
Tom drove a car all by himself,

05:39.587 --> 05:40.939
Rachel's car, without telling her,

05:40.940 --> 05:43.007
because Jacob to talk to you.

05:43.008 --> 05:44.122
Honey, they could have beenilled.

05:44.123 --> 05:45.495
They could have been but they weren't.

05:45.496 --> 05:48.253
And he wasn't desperate he
was desperate to drive,

05:48.254 --> 05:50.509
he's always I was just the excuse.

05:50.510 --> 05:51.392
Well, I don't want there to

05:51.393 --> 05:54.535
be any more excuses available
to him or to Jacob,

05:54.536 --> 05:55.960
I want you to talk to Jacob.

05:55.961 --> 05:57.137
And if you're not gonna talk to him,

05:57.138 --> 05:58.639
then I want you to move home.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.063
If you can't act like a grown-up,

06:00.064 --> 06:02.122
then you shouldn't be
living like a grown-up.

06:02.123 --> 06:05.349
But I'm hoping that you can. I need you to.

06:05.350 --> 06:07.960
Grace, I need you to grow up
a little bit this summer.

06:10.241 --> 06:14.097
I won't do it again. I promise.

06:14.098 --> 06:16.567
Just get your things back
into your room, Tom.

06:18.175 --> 06:20.016
What, he's moving back into the house?

06:20.459 --> 06:22.552
He and Jacob are gonna
live in his room together?

06:22.553 --> 06:24.626
I want to let Jacob move in to your room.

06:24.627 --> 06:28.511
And I was thinking that since
at the end of the summer,

06:28.512 --> 06:30.628
that maybe, since you're a senior, then...

06:30.629 --> 06:31.810
You're gonna give me the guest house?

06:31.811 --> 06:33.880
Conditional to you working things out

06:33.881 --> 06:35.213
with Jacob by end of summer.

06:35.214 --> 06:36.854
And then, we'll talk about the rules.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.815
Thank you! I love you! Thank you!!

06:38.816 --> 06:40.953
I promise, I promise, I'll be responsible,

06:40.954 --> 06:43.170
and I'll talk to Jacob and
I'll do whatever you want.

06:43.171 --> 06:44.879
Thank you. Thank you., Mom.

06:48.193 --> 06:49.784
There's nothing else going on, is there?

06:49.785 --> 06:51.394
Um... A few things.

06:51.395 --> 06:52.930
Okay, well start with the car.

06:52.931 --> 06:54.853
I mean, how did Tom even find the keys?

06:54.854 --> 06:58.801
Did he really drive? So,
when's Rachel moving out?

07:00.239 --> 07:03.335
Tom, I just... called me, Tom.

07:03.336 --> 07:05.936
I would have if it was that important.

07:05.988 --> 07:08.213
You know me. I'd do anything for you.

07:08.214 --> 07:09.168
Would you?

07:09.169 --> 07:10.525
Sure, little buddy.

07:11.216 --> 07:13.240
I changed my mind about Rachel.

07:13.241 --> 07:16.226
I know and I am grateful that you did.

07:16.227 --> 07:19.945
I really like that woman. To marry her.

07:19.946 --> 07:21.942
I don't want her to move out.

07:21.943 --> 07:23.289
Well, I don't know, Tom.
Kind of smallght be

07:23.290 --> 07:25.241
for the four or five of us.

07:25.242 --> 07:27.630
I need her to stay here.

07:27.631 --> 07:30.394
What? Without you.

07:30.462 --> 07:32.063
Oh.

07:33.709 --> 07:36.136
Well, I don't think she's
gonna do that, Tom,

07:36.137 --> 07:37.046
and not just because of me.

07:37.047 --> 07:39.182
She's pretty upset with you this morning.

07:39.212 --> 07:40.649
She'll get over it.

07:40.650 --> 07:42.808
I thought you didn't even want a family.

07:42.809 --> 07:46.596
That was before the family got a car.

07:47.821 --> 07:49.032
Huh.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.603
Dad, you can't be serious. Quit
my job at the church nursery?

07:51.604 --> 07:52.663
Yeah. I'll pay you.

07:52.664 --> 07:54.184
You can come right here
after school with John,

07:54.185 --> 07:55.265
and you two can have nursery here,

07:55.266 --> 07:57.504
and then when Robie's here, you
can keep Robie after school,

07:57.505 --> 07:58.512
so I can get out and do my thing.

07:58.513 --> 08:00.535
And when do I get to do my thing?

08:00.536 --> 08:01.154
What's your thing?

08:01.155 --> 08:03.052
Being a mother is my thing and

08:03.053 --> 08:05.153
not getting to be a
teenager is my other thing.

08:05.154 --> 08:06.019
What's your thing?

08:06.020 --> 08:07.599
My thing is... I have to

08:07.600 --> 08:09.067
be able to get out on my own now and then.

08:09.068 --> 08:10.101
Why you and not me?

08:10.102 --> 08:11.859
Because I'm a grown man and
I need to go to the bank,

08:11.860 --> 08:14.322
I need to go to the dry
cleaners, the grocery store...

08:14.785 --> 08:16.784
And over to Kathleen's in
the middle of the night?

08:16.785 --> 08:18.639
Or over to Kathleen's in
the middle of the night.

08:18.640 --> 08:19.850
She's a friend. She needed my help.

08:19.851 --> 08:21.084
And there is nothing
wrong with my going out

08:21.085 --> 08:22.149
with any woman any time of night

08:22.150 --> 08:23.236
provided that Robie is taken care of,

08:23.237 --> 08:24.215
and that's where you come in.

08:24.216 --> 08:25.957
I'm going to quit my job
at the church nursery

08:25.958 --> 08:27.861
so that you can go help your ex-wife?

08:27.862 --> 08:29.459
If that's what I want to do, yeah.

08:29.460 --> 08:30.995
Your mother does anything she wants to do,

08:30.996 --> 08:32.279
I should be able to do what I want to do.

08:32.280 --> 08:35.013
Mom has 24 hour child care where she lives.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.017
That's why she can do what she wants to do.

08:37.018 --> 08:38.258
I cannot be available to you

08:38.259 --> 08:40.479
24/7 whenever you have Robie, I just can't.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.774
But I would pay you just to be available.

08:42.775 --> 08:45.122
I don't want to be available!

08:45.368 --> 08:47.086
And even if I did, I can't provide what

08:47.087 --> 08:48.339
the church nursery can for John.

08:48.340 --> 08:49.422
And just what are they providing

08:49.423 --> 08:51.830
other than a safe place for him
to stay while you're at school?

08:51.831 --> 08:54.465
Are you kidding me? They have a
music program, an art program...

08:54.466 --> 08:55.792
He can dance and scribble at home.

08:55.793 --> 08:58.116
Why don't you just put Robie
in the church nursery?

08:58.117 --> 08:59.380
They're not open 24 hours.

08:59.381 --> 09:03.054
Neither am I. Why are you
suddenly so desperate, huh?

09:03.055 --> 09:06.135
Why, because one time you couldn't
go somewhere you wanted to go?

09:06.136 --> 09:08.181
Please, welcome to my life.

09:08.182 --> 09:10.080
Except Mom will be back in a
week and you're off the hook.

09:10.081 --> 09:11.520
I don't want off the hook,

09:11.521 --> 09:12.755
I want to work out
something with your mother

09:12.756 --> 09:15.687
where I have my son as much as she does.
I just need child care.

09:15.688 --> 09:18.021
If I had child care, I could
keep Robie here whenever I want

09:18.022 --> 09:19.459
and still lead a normal life.

09:19.460 --> 09:21.148
Have you learned nothing from me?

09:21.149 --> 09:23.311
You cannot have a baby
and lead a normal life.

09:23.312 --> 09:25.024
Well, I can for one day.

09:25.025 --> 09:26.717
Robie should be up in 20 minutes.
Bye. Thanks.

09:26.718 --> 09:28.505
Wait! You come back here right...

09:31.465 --> 09:32.703
Right this minute!

09:33.188 --> 09:34.500
Does your father know you were

09:34.501 --> 09:36.364
here last night with
your little sweetie pie?

09:36.365 --> 09:38.534
Uh, didn't mention it to him.

09:38.535 --> 09:41.160
But, um, if you want me to, I will.

09:41.161 --> 09:42.503
I want you to.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.422
Please don't make me say anything.

09:44.508 --> 09:47.955
It was probably not the best
idea, but it was harmless.

09:47.956 --> 09:49.759
And it was kind of fun.

09:49.760 --> 09:54.099
Yeah, I saw. Look, Lover Boy,
it's dangerous, you got it?

09:54.100 --> 09:55.294
It's dangerous to come into

09:55.295 --> 09:57.591
a business late at night
when no one's around.

09:57.592 --> 09:59.313
Suppose someone sees you opening the door,

09:59.314 --> 10:01.711
and they rush in with you
and they rob the joint,

10:01.712 --> 10:05.736
or worse, beat the crap out
of you and your girlfriend?

10:06.309 --> 10:08.372
Don't do it again. You got that?

10:08.949 --> 10:09.987
Promise.

10:11.162 --> 10:13.104
Yeah, don't do that again.

10:13.277 --> 10:16.129
Having a little fight with the
missus when we dropped by?

10:16.130 --> 10:17.884
No, I was just annoyed with her.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.260
Doesn't want to set a date?

10:19.261 --> 10:20.600
She doesn't have to set a date.

10:20.601 --> 10:22.604
But you'd rather she would, I imagine.

10:22.605 --> 10:24.310
After that big fat proposal

10:24.311 --> 10:26.239
in front of the entire graduating class.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.270
Could be pretty embarrassing
if she called it off.

10:28.271 --> 10:30.035
Of course, it could be more embarrassing

10:30.036 --> 10:32.972
if you set a date and she
was a runaway bride.

10:34.992 --> 10:36.027
Hi.

10:36.028 --> 10:36.995
Hi.

10:38.867 --> 10:41.328
What brings you to the butcher
shop this fine morning?

10:42.043 --> 10:43.486
You're in a good mood.

10:43.487 --> 10:45.081
I'm having a fairly good morning,

10:45.082 --> 10:47.220
following a very good evening.

10:47.472 --> 10:51.526
Wow. You could be a little more,

10:51.573 --> 10:53.761
I don't know, considerate?

10:54.238 --> 10:58.005
Respectful? Appropriately sad
or even appropriately happy?

10:58.006 --> 10:59.851
About? The divorce.

11:00.084 --> 11:00.998
Beg your pardon?

11:00.999 --> 11:03.603
You got the papers saying
it's all official, right?

11:03.935 --> 11:05.043
The divorce papers?

11:05.044 --> 11:07.619
Uh, no.

11:07.653 --> 11:10.746
Oh. Well, I did.

11:10.747 --> 11:14.390
And I just wanted to say face to face

11:14.391 --> 11:18.209
that I am very grateful for
everything you've done for me,

11:18.210 --> 11:23.044
and I appreciate that
we could part amicably,

11:23.774 --> 11:28.416
and goodbye and good luck.

11:29.274 --> 11:34.198
And things are working out
really well for me and Omar.

11:34.547 --> 11:35.883
So...

11:38.006 --> 11:39.090
Bye.

11:46.077 --> 11:48.855
So, I heard. It's official, huh?

11:48.856 --> 11:52.867
Yeah. I don't know what the big deal is,

11:53.455 --> 11:55.353
we knew we were getting divorced.

11:57.230 --> 11:59.813
Hey, at least she married me.

12:08.184 --> 12:11.430
Oh. Hi. Hi. You can't stay.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.883
Bunny has this thing about mixing
personal life and business,

12:13.884 --> 12:15.689
and she's already upset
that we were in here...

12:15.690 --> 12:17.672
But we can talk later, but you can't stay.

12:17.673 --> 12:20.771
And you can't send me text
messages saying you can't see me

12:20.772 --> 12:22.376
because you're seeing your ex-wife.

12:22.377 --> 12:24.035
We talk about this later.

12:24.036 --> 12:26.435
I just want to go by and
talk to Adrian after work.

12:28.246 --> 12:31.745
She just looked upset and she's
not answering her phone, so...

12:31.769 --> 12:34.070
She was my wife and we went
through a lot together,

12:34.071 --> 12:36.167
and I just want to make
sure that she's okay.

12:36.168 --> 12:38.071
She's okay, and even if she's not,

12:38.072 --> 12:41.471
she has someone else. Let
her cry on Omar's shoulder.

12:41.472 --> 12:43.123
We can talk about this later.

12:46.745 --> 12:48.735
Dylan, Dylan, please.

12:49.691 --> 12:52.730
Ben, I think I made it clear how
I feel about your ex-wives.

12:53.527 --> 12:56.263
Hey, everything all right here?

12:58.946 --> 13:00.353
Amy is not my ex-wife.

13:00.354 --> 13:02.098
You were married. Not legally.

13:02.099 --> 13:03.032
Semantics.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.221
I just want to talk to Adrian. No.

13:06.741 --> 13:07.765
Hello.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.338
This is my boss, Bunny.

13:10.339 --> 13:11.550
Bunny, Dylan, Dylan, Bunny.

13:11.551 --> 13:14.011
I was just telling her I
have to get back to work.

13:14.514 --> 13:15.969
I didn't know you were a ginger.

13:15.970 --> 13:17.980
Didn't show up on the security cam.

13:17.981 --> 13:19.686
That's a very old system.

13:19.687 --> 13:22.135
So you were saying last night.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.030
Don't be too long here.

13:24.266 --> 13:25.359
And don't touch that hair.

13:25.360 --> 13:29.012
Same to you, and how do you get that shine?

13:29.013 --> 13:32.290
A little secret I call bacon grease.

13:36.612 --> 13:38.002
So, are we going out?

13:39.295 --> 13:42.544
I need to see Adrian tonight, I'm sorry.

13:43.902 --> 13:44.957
Me, too.

13:47.198 --> 13:49.157
Yeah, and then he just took off.

13:49.158 --> 13:50.373
He's just using the fact

13:50.374 --> 13:51.977
that we do our laundry
here every other week

13:51.978 --> 13:53.297
to take advantage of me.

13:53.298 --> 13:54.904
I'm sure he won't be gone all day,

13:54.905 --> 13:56.778
and if he is, I'll come
over when I get o off work,

13:56.779 --> 13:58.409
but I'm at work right now,

13:58.410 --> 14:00.505
and Bunny has rules about
cell phones, so...

14:00.506 --> 14:04.091
I bet he is gone all day. You know
he's going over to Kathleen's.

14:04.092 --> 14:06.245
No, I don't know that,
and you don't know that.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.488
Yes I know that! How?

14:08.489 --> 14:10.805
Because he wanted to go over
there in the middle of the night

14:10.806 --> 14:13.245
and he couldn't, so first chance he got,

14:13.246 --> 14:14.986
he's over there and I'm
over here babysitting.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.758
And doing our laundry.

14:16.759 --> 14:18.618
I don't want to have to babysit

14:18.619 --> 14:20.283
so he can go see Wife Number One.

14:20.284 --> 14:22.428
And I'm sure my mother wouldn't
want me to babysit for him

14:22.429 --> 14:23.874
so he can go see Wife Number One.

14:23.875 --> 14:26.192
Maybe your mother wouldn't
even care, you don't know.

14:26.193 --> 14:27.438
And even if she does care,

14:27.439 --> 14:28.949
it's not up to you to stop your dad

14:28.950 --> 14:31.685
from seeing anyone he wants to
see including Wife Number One.

14:31.686 --> 14:33.140
And now you've got me calling her that.

14:33.141 --> 14:35.505
I don't want my dad to care
more about Grace's mother

14:35.506 --> 14:37.208
than he cares about my mother!

14:37.209 --> 14:39.089
All right, I'm sorry, I'm sure that must be

14:39.090 --> 14:40.606
really hard on you for some reason.

14:40.607 --> 14:42.378
We can talk about this later.

14:44.067 --> 14:45.132
Can't wait.

14:47.263 --> 14:49.687
Hey, Ames. Saw the car out front.

14:50.020 --> 14:51.386
Laundry day, huh?

14:51.409 --> 14:53.795
Yea. And babysitting day.

14:54.333 --> 14:56.774
Isn't every day babysitting day for you?

14:56.809 --> 15:00.810
Oh, not John, I meant
the screamer in there.

15:01.059 --> 15:03.313
Yeah, Dad left and I'm supposed
to be babysitting Robie.

15:03.314 --> 15:05.311
But hey, now that you're here...

15:05.732 --> 15:07.747
Maybe you can help me fold.

15:08.717 --> 15:10.648
Sorry. I know how lame that sounded.

15:10.649 --> 15:12.564
Don't sweat it. That's what I'm here for.

15:12.565 --> 15:14.636
I'm the babysitter's companion.

15:15.695 --> 15:18.209
It's okay. I totally get it
if people don't trust me,

15:18.210 --> 15:20.594
it comes with the territory.
Besides, you're right,

15:21.213 --> 15:24.723
little Robie is a bit of a howler.

15:24.724 --> 15:27.685
You know, I'm used to crying,
I can handle crying.

15:27.686 --> 15:30.754
But Robie, he's like a police siren.

15:30.755 --> 15:33.085
Yeah, or like that alarm that goes off

15:33.086 --> 15:34.154
when you walk out of a store

15:34.155 --> 15:36.344
and the tag's still on
the shirt you just...

15:37.296 --> 15:38.371
Bought.

15:39.512 --> 15:40.559
Yeah.

15:40.574 --> 15:43.017
I don't really fold very well.

15:43.018 --> 15:44.569
I think I'll just get showered.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.472
You know what? Actually,
there is this one thing

15:46.473 --> 15:47.696
that maybe you could help me with.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.139
I do need your help with something.

15:49.140 --> 15:51.730
I'm not really good at helping,

15:51.731 --> 15:54.256
I mean, it's insulting but
completely understandable

15:54.257 --> 15:55.582
if nobody wants me to babysit,

15:55.583 --> 15:57.114
but I'm not looking to be helpful.

15:57.115 --> 15:59.752
Being helpful gets you in trouble.

15:59.753 --> 16:01.489
So I don't want to help

16:01.629 --> 16:03.994
if you're just trying to make
me feel good or something.

16:03.995 --> 16:07.787
Oh, no, no, no. That's not it, um...

16:08.092 --> 16:09.650
I just need you to tell me...

16:09.651 --> 16:11.716
Do you think that my dad
is in love with Kathleen?

16:11.717 --> 16:14.663
I'm sure he would tell you
before he told any of us.

16:14.721 --> 16:16.124
Has he said anything?

16:16.745 --> 16:17.728
You know, where I come from,

16:17.729 --> 16:20.095
being a snitch is definitely frowned upon.

16:20.096 --> 16:21.573
Well, you're not in prison here.

16:21.574 --> 16:24.627
No, it's more like house arrest.
I gotta get a car. See ya.

16:24.628 --> 16:27.600
Wait! I really... I really want to know.

16:27.947 --> 16:30.212
I mean, my dad deserves to
be happy, don't you think?

16:30.213 --> 16:32.848
And I feel that if he was happy
and if my mom was happy,

16:32.849 --> 16:34.942
then maybe I could be happy.

16:35.194 --> 16:37.431
There's a lot of that going around.

16:38.020 --> 16:39.796
You can't base your happiness

16:39.797 --> 16:41.489
on someone else's happiness,

16:41.548 --> 16:42.837
but think he feels the same way

16:42.838 --> 16:44.247
about you and your mom and Ashley.

16:44.248 --> 16:46.611
If Anne was happy and you were
happy and Ashley was happy,

16:46.612 --> 16:48.289
then he'd be happy too.

16:48.290 --> 16:50.300
Or at least, feel free to be happy anyway.

16:50.301 --> 16:52.514
Well, Ashley is never going to be happy,

16:52.515 --> 16:55.093
and I'm sure my mom feels
the same way I do.

16:55.479 --> 16:57.662
And it wouldn't be the worst thing

16:57.663 --> 17:00.372
if my dad was in love with Kathleen.

17:00.790 --> 17:02.396
No? No.

17:03.571 --> 17:04.880
All right then...

17:06.280 --> 17:08.122
He's in love with his first wife,

17:08.123 --> 17:11.326
always has been, always will be.
That's my opinion.

17:18.358 --> 17:19.537
Ow!

17:25.481 --> 17:27.097
Adrian, you won't believe what happened.

17:27.098 --> 17:28.828
Tell me about it in person, I'm hungry,

17:28.829 --> 17:30.503
I want to go get something to eat.
Where are you?

17:30.504 --> 17:32.699
I'm in my room, packing up my things.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.240
Grace, you're running out of space here,

17:34.241 --> 17:35.447
what else do you need to bring over?

17:35.448 --> 17:38.691
More importantly, why do I need
to bring anything else over?

17:38.794 --> 17:40.475
I don't know, but whatever the
answer to that question is,

17:40.476 --> 17:41.602
you can tell me over food.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.185
I'm getting the guest house!

17:43.187 --> 17:44.237
Mom said that when school starts,

17:44.238 --> 17:46.363
I can move into the guest house. With Tom?

17:46.364 --> 17:47.978
No, not with Tom.

17:47.979 --> 17:51.703
Great. Then, you have all summer to do that.
I need you now.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.020
I can't, Adrian, I have to talk to Jacob.

17:54.021 --> 17:55.668
I sort of promised I would,

17:55.669 --> 17:58.446
I sort of have to in order
to get the guest house.

17:58.447 --> 18:00.099
Last night, he and...

18:06.410 --> 18:08.079
What did you tell her that for?

18:08.080 --> 18:10.064
Oh, I don't know. It's the truth?

18:10.065 --> 18:12.225
You can't just blurt out a truth like that.

18:12.226 --> 18:13.329
She asked.

18:13.330 --> 18:14.850
She didn't really want to know.

18:14.851 --> 18:17.283
Well, I didn't know she
didn't really want to know.

18:17.284 --> 18:20.013
She said she wanted to know,
and maybe she needs to know.

18:20.014 --> 18:21.998
Everyone in this family is very hung up on

18:21.999 --> 18:24.027
everyone else in the family being happy.

18:24.255 --> 18:25.486
Tell me about it.

18:25.487 --> 18:28.414
You know, maybe it'll start
with George and Kathleen.

18:28.415 --> 18:30.397
Okay, Amy asked you about him,

18:30.398 --> 18:32.189
now I'm gonna ask you about Anne.

18:32.654 --> 18:35.969
What's going on with her
? Is she gay, is she not gay?

18:35.970 --> 18:38.995
I don't know. I honestly don't know.

18:38.996 --> 18:40.435
Do you hope she's gay?

18:40.436 --> 18:41.989
I don't care if she's gay or not.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.282
You don't have any feelings towards her?

18:44.283 --> 18:46.696
I like her. I don't "Like her" Like her,

18:46.697 --> 18:48.554
like I want to sleep with her or anything.

18:48.555 --> 18:53.145
I just think she's a nice woman,
she's funny and she's smart.

18:53.312 --> 18:54.365
I've got a lot of respect for her.

18:54.366 --> 18:56.151
She's a successful business woman,

18:56.152 --> 18:58.726
she's raising a kid, she's
taking care of her mother...

18:58.727 --> 19:02.470
She's not my type. And again,
I don't know if she's gay.

19:02.471 --> 19:04.991
Well, do me a favor, if you
can choose who you love,

19:04.992 --> 19:06.820
don't choose Anne. Even if she is gay,

19:06.821 --> 19:08.574
it's just too incestuous.

19:08.575 --> 19:11.043
I want you to be happy
too, but you know what?

19:11.044 --> 19:12.996
I'm going to look out for me and
Amy first, I can't help it.

19:12.997 --> 19:14.659
So don't go there.

19:14.660 --> 19:16.320
Totally understand.

19:16.918 --> 19:17.944
Bunny.

19:20.702 --> 19:22.413
She totally took me by surprise.

19:22.414 --> 19:23.688
Mmm.

19:27.881 --> 19:28.678
Hello.

19:28.679 --> 19:29.815
Hey, do I have some mail there?

19:29.816 --> 19:30.852
Yeah, you do.

19:30.853 --> 19:32.718
Some mail like my divorce papers?

19:32.719 --> 19:35.067
I got mine, too. I was
gonna give you yours,

19:35.068 --> 19:37.289
but you had your first date
with Dylan last night,

19:37.290 --> 19:39.091
so I was waiting until this morning...

19:39.105 --> 19:42.387
But you took off, so... Yeah, they're here.

19:42.388 --> 19:44.144
Dad, those papers are important.

19:44.145 --> 19:47.009
Important, yeah, but they
were expected, so...

19:47.010 --> 19:48.992
So Adrian thought I
insulted her or something

19:48.993 --> 19:51.567
because I didn't call her when I
got them, her feelings are hurt.

19:51.568 --> 19:54.284
Maybe, but I don't think that's it.

19:55.179 --> 19:57.960
It just doesn't feel so
good to remind yourself

19:57.961 --> 20:00.861
that something you wanted
just didn't work out,

20:01.057 --> 20:04.053
but I've got problems of my
own, and you're at work.

20:06.654 --> 20:07.420
I want to go through that

20:07.421 --> 20:10.545
all over again for the next 18 years? No.

20:10.546 --> 20:12.060
Do you want me to talk to Camille

20:12.061 --> 20:14.357
so I can explain evything to her?

20:14.402 --> 20:16.301
No, that's okay, Betty,

20:16.576 --> 20:18.591
I probably shouldn't even
have said anything about it,

20:18.592 --> 20:20.341
but we're friends, right?

20:20.342 --> 20:22.042
We're the best of friends.

20:22.302 --> 20:25.119
Which is why I called you over here.

20:25.431 --> 20:27.665
I wanted to talk to you about dropping by.

20:27.666 --> 20:30.894
I didn't drop by, you called me over here.

20:31.067 --> 20:32.890
To talk about dropping by.

20:32.891 --> 20:36.635
Again? You want me to drop by again today?

20:39.592 --> 20:43.514
No, I want you to... Here's the thing...

20:44.687 --> 20:46.623
If you could, kind of just...

20:50.035 --> 20:52.491
You know what, never mind.

20:52.749 --> 20:55.386
Well, I better be going so I can get back.

20:56.364 --> 21:00.303
Yeah. And, uh, thanks for
listening, I feel a lot better.

21:00.304 --> 21:01.987
Look, I'll call you once in a while.

21:01.988 --> 21:05.874
We'll talk or have lunch,
or do something...

21:05.875 --> 21:08.029
If you're not too busy
with your school work.

21:08.030 --> 21:09.182
Anytime.

21:31.541 --> 21:33.234
Not to worry, not to worry,

21:33.235 --> 21:35.197
I was going to take it by your hotel.

21:36.099 --> 21:38.546
You mentioned where you and
your daughter were staying.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.754
So, I was going to come by on my way home.

21:40.755 --> 21:42.205
You speak English?

21:42.291 --> 21:43.965
Of course I speak English.

21:45.743 --> 21:48.110
So, you understood everything

21:48.111 --> 21:49.984
my daughter and I were talking about?

21:52.773 --> 21:54.788
I didn't know at what point to stop you,

21:54.789 --> 21:56.518
and I thought you were
going to be on your way

21:56.519 --> 22:00.913
and I would never see you
again, but fate intervened.

22:01.927 --> 22:05.953
Would you like to go for a cup
of coffee, maybe a drink?

22:06.103 --> 22:10.021
Oh. Um... No, thank you.

22:10.022 --> 22:12.322
I really should get back to my daughter.

22:13.267 --> 22:14.781
Perhaps some other time.

22:14.883 --> 22:16.908
Yeah. Perhaps.

22:18.803 --> 22:20.145
Or perhaps not.

22:20.146 --> 22:21.501
So I heard.

22:30.127 --> 22:31.006
I'm not in a hurry.

22:31.007 --> 22:32.697
Well, you kind of seem to be in a hurry.

22:33.359 --> 22:35.001
Oh, sorry.

22:36.703 --> 22:37.677
Thanks for coming over.

22:37.678 --> 22:39.192
You want to go to a movie?

22:39.662 --> 22:43.208
No, not really, I'll
just talk to you later.

22:43.390 --> 22:45.048
You'll just talk to me later?

22:45.679 --> 22:46.744
I didn't just come over here

22:46.745 --> 22:48.808
to have sex with you
and talk to you later.

22:48.809 --> 22:49.912
Let's spend some time together,

22:49.913 --> 22:52.567
let's go do something, let's
get out of this condo,

22:52.568 --> 22:54.967
and go to the beach, or drive
up the coast, or something.

22:54.968 --> 22:57.202
Nah, I don't really feel like it.

22:57.941 --> 23:01.478
I'm just still, you know,
sad about the divorce.

23:01.479 --> 23:03.734
Well, you weren't too sad
to have sex with me.

23:03.735 --> 23:05.185
I thought it would make me feel happier,

23:05.186 --> 23:07.196
but it actually made me
feel kind of lonely.

23:07.890 --> 23:10.786
Look, no offense, I'm just not
in a good place right now.

23:10.787 --> 23:12.690
You seemed like you were in a
good place 15 minutes ago.

23:12.691 --> 23:14.610
Yeah, but now I just want
to spend some time alone.

23:14.611 --> 23:16.578
You called me because Grace wasn't home,

23:16.579 --> 23:17.698
and you didn't want to be alone.

23:17.699 --> 23:19.714
After we just did what we did,
you want to be alone now?

23:19.715 --> 23:23.537
Okay, so last night you wanted
me to be more vulnerable,

23:23.538 --> 23:25.795
and today you don't want me
to be vulnerable at all.

23:25.796 --> 23:27.617
I'd hardly call kicking
my butt out of here

23:27.618 --> 23:29.426
after using me to have sex vulnerable.

23:29.427 --> 23:31.186
I wasn't using you to have sex,

23:31.187 --> 23:33.490
I was using sex to make me
feel better and it didn't.

23:33.491 --> 23:34.978
Well, that's not what you use sex for.

23:34.979 --> 23:36.114
I mean it's fun and all that,

23:36.115 --> 23:37.794
but I'd hope that you do that with me

23:37.795 --> 23:38.761
because you care something about me.

23:38.762 --> 23:42.352
Look, I'm not in the mood to
argue with you, all right?

23:43.478 --> 23:46.358
I do, Omar, I do care about you,

23:46.359 --> 23:48.609
I told Ben that this morning.

23:49.750 --> 23:51.265
This morning when?

23:52.039 --> 23:53.185
When?

23:56.274 --> 23:58.416
When I went down to the butcher shop.

23:58.876 --> 24:00.959
I just wanted this whole
marriage thing to feel final,

24:00.960 --> 24:02.542
and I wanted to say goodbye face to face.

24:02.543 --> 24:05.530
Not marriage, divorce. It was a divorce.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.471
And you know what, Adrian,

24:07.472 --> 24:09.338
this is just not going to work.

24:17.521 --> 24:18.827
What?

24:19.232 --> 24:20.458
Adrian?

24:21.585 --> 24:22.923
Yeah?

24:24.572 --> 24:27.366
Hi, mind if I come in?

24:29.741 --> 24:32.151
Is everything okay?

24:32.701 --> 24:36.455
You must be Omar. I'm Dylan,
Ben's new girlfriend.

24:42.903 --> 24:44.177
Grace? Yeah?

24:44.775 --> 24:46.369
I didn't know if you were still here.

24:46.883 --> 24:49.533
I just wanted to bring my
suitcase over from Tom's room.

24:49.843 --> 24:52.717
Big move, all the way across the hall.

24:53.411 --> 24:54.940
You can bring it over.

24:59.822 --> 25:01.549
You can come in, if you want.

25:01.550 --> 25:02.713
Thanks.

25:05.407 --> 25:07.832
I wonder if you'd mind if I paint.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.221
Paint my room?

25:12.222 --> 25:13.288
Yeah.

25:14.895 --> 25:17.742
Okay, I guess I don't mind
if you paint my room,

25:17.743 --> 25:22.024
it's just that my dad painted
this room lavender for me.

25:23.150 --> 25:24.665
He painted my room too,

25:24.767 --> 25:26.158
and he put up bookshelves on the walls.

25:26.159 --> 25:29.262
I didn't want bookshelves. I
didn't really want the clutter.

25:29.263 --> 25:31.565
Plus, when I read, it just stays up here.

25:31.566 --> 25:34.473
So, I don't need to show off
with books or anything.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.366
We used to read a book
together every summer.

25:36.367 --> 25:38.030
Yeah, we used to read
together too, all the time.

25:38.031 --> 25:39.006
Yeah, so did we.

25:39.007 --> 25:42.440
You said that. He liked
to hunt, big game.

25:42.879 --> 25:44.782
We went quite a few times.
He was a very good shot.

25:44.783 --> 25:46.926
We used to go to the zoo
together all the time,

25:46.927 --> 25:48.429
we were known at the zoo.

25:48.430 --> 25:49.789
By the zookeepers or the animals?

25:49.790 --> 25:51.017
Both.

25:51.087 --> 25:55.054
We went to London once, the two
of us, on his way back home.

25:55.055 --> 25:57.305
You did not. No, we did.

25:57.871 --> 25:59.721
My mother has family in London.

26:00.159 --> 26:03.406
Did the two of you ever travel
together, go on vacations?

26:03.407 --> 26:05.414
No, he didn't have time for vacation

26:05.415 --> 26:06.136
because he was always

26:06.137 --> 26:07.812
volunteering his time to
serve people in need.

26:07.813 --> 26:09.823
Or so we thought.

26:10.857 --> 26:15.079
Okay, well, I'm happy we at
least have a dialogue going.

26:15.080 --> 26:16.755
This isn't a dialogue,

26:16.953 --> 26:19.144
this is a contest to see
who Dad loved the most.

26:19.145 --> 26:21.475
If that's the contest, then you win.

26:22.921 --> 26:26.563
He married your mother and he
spent most of his life with you.

26:31.533 --> 26:35.879
Look, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

26:36.317 --> 26:37.788
You never thought about that?

26:37.789 --> 26:38.935
No.

26:42.085 --> 26:43.822
I love your continent.

26:46.677 --> 26:50.164
I don't want to move back into my old room.
That stinks.

26:50.165 --> 26:52.099
Then you shouldn't have taken
the keys to Rachel's car

26:52.100 --> 26:54.308
and gone joy riding in the
middle of the night with Jacob.

26:54.309 --> 26:56.388
You could have killed
yourself and your brother,

26:56.389 --> 26:58.704
and whatever innocent person
or people you crashed into.

26:58.705 --> 27:02.768
I didn't crash! I'm a very good driver.

27:02.769 --> 27:04.882
No doubt you got the skill, Tom,
but it takes more than that.

27:04.883 --> 27:06.288
It takes a certain
maturity you don't have,

27:06.289 --> 27:08.704
and I say that because you took
the car without permission

27:08.705 --> 27:09.568
and you broke the law.

27:09.569 --> 27:11.328
It was a very immature,
dangerous thing to do.

27:11.329 --> 27:12.336
I know, but...

27:12.337 --> 27:13.962
No buts about it, my friend.

27:13.963 --> 27:15.498
You cannot drive without a license,

27:15.499 --> 27:18.042
and if you're gonna do the crime,
be prepared to do the time.

27:18.043 --> 27:19.754
In your old room, in your house,

27:19.755 --> 27:21.258
with your mother right down the hall,

27:21.259 --> 27:22.538
because that's where she wants you,

27:22.539 --> 27:24.394
so that's how it's gonna be.

27:24.395 --> 27:26.314
I don't want to live here anymore.

27:26.315 --> 27:27.175
Where do you want to live?

27:27.176 --> 27:29.240
In the guest house with Rachel.

27:29.241 --> 27:30.793
Rachel's moving, and you really

27:30.794 --> 27:32.152
don't want to live in
the guest house alone,

27:32.153 --> 27:33.672
besides it's Grace's turn.

27:33.673 --> 27:36.312
Rachel is not moving. I changed my mind.

27:36.313 --> 27:39.256
Uh, Rachel is moving, I talked
to her, I talked to Milton,

27:39.257 --> 27:40.326
she's moving.

27:40.327 --> 27:41.762
And she's moving a little
sooner than she would have

27:41.763 --> 27:44.153
because she feels responsible
for what happened.

27:44.703 --> 27:46.121
Then I'm moving!

27:48.811 --> 27:51.018
Hi, George. Hey.

27:51.019 --> 27:52.538
I didn't know you were here.

27:52.539 --> 27:55.942
Yes, you did. You told him to talk to me.

27:56.269 --> 27:58.778
Yes, I did ask George to talk to you,

27:58.779 --> 28:01.461
I just didn't know he was here
talking to you right now.

28:05.815 --> 28:08.017
I really hate that this happened.

28:08.295 --> 28:09.942
I'm so upset with him, George.

28:09.943 --> 28:12.032
He knows he's not supposed to drive a car.

28:12.086 --> 28:13.286
Eh, it's all right, nobody got hurt.

28:13.287 --> 28:14.500
Somebody could have gotten hurt.

28:14.501 --> 28:15.668
Could've, should've, would've,

28:15.669 --> 28:18.371
didn't happen, got anything to eat?

28:18.372 --> 28:20.452
There's always something
to eat here, George.

28:20.453 --> 28:24.670
There's yogurt, there's some
sliced turkey, there's fruit.

28:24.853 --> 28:27.727
Man stuff. Beef jerky, chips, beer?

28:29.877 --> 28:31.822
I notice that you got a haircut.

28:32.181 --> 28:33.375
Did I?

28:34.528 --> 28:35.791
Well, thanks for noticing.

28:35.792 --> 28:38.879
And did you drop by the bank
before you got the haircut?

28:38.880 --> 28:39.936
I did.

28:39.937 --> 28:43.531
Then didn't you go by the
market after the haircut?

28:43.905 --> 28:46.539
You always did on Saturdays
when we were married.

28:47.127 --> 28:48.662
Bank, haircut...

28:48.663 --> 28:52.336
No, dry cleaner, and then the market.

28:52.486 --> 28:54.309
I have changed a little bit, you know.

28:54.310 --> 28:55.473
Have you?

28:55.591 --> 28:59.505
Yeah. For one thing, I've learned
to pick up my dirty socks.

29:02.056 --> 29:03.329
Here's your son.

29:03.617 --> 29:06.133
Have a good Saturday. Come on. Let's go.

29:15.355 --> 29:16.586
Amy just wanted you to see

29:16.587 --> 29:19.132
I'm kind of tied up here
for the next 18 years.

29:19.133 --> 29:20.412
Oh, she just doesn't want

29:20.413 --> 29:21.948
you to love anyone other than her mother.

29:21.949 --> 29:23.366
I totally get it.

29:23.516 --> 29:26.362
But, George, I'm kind of tied up too,

29:26.363 --> 29:27.339
and you know, not for the

29:27.340 --> 29:29.279
next 18 years but for the rest of my life.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.996
I mean, Tom's always going to
need me to take care of him.

29:31.997 --> 29:33.724
Maybe, maybe not, you never know.

29:33.725 --> 29:35.644
Well, he's always gonna need someone.

29:35.645 --> 29:36.903
Aren't we all?

29:36.908 --> 29:38.880
I guess. He's fine,

29:38.881 --> 29:40.987
and you don't have to figure
it all out this weekend,

29:40.988 --> 29:41.926
you've just got all this

29:41.927 --> 29:42.852
negative stuff rolling around in your head

29:42.853 --> 29:44.788
because you've finally decided
to cut that guy loose.

29:44.789 --> 29:46.692
No, really, it's not just that.

29:46.693 --> 29:48.867
I mean, it's great that Tom has a job,

29:48.868 --> 29:50.188
and that he can get around on the bus,

29:50.189 --> 29:51.854
but he needs me.

29:51.855 --> 29:52.763
And I don't know what's

29:52.764 --> 29:54.507
gonna happen to him if
something happens to me,

29:54.508 --> 29:56.539
and, of course, eventually
something's gonna happen to me.

29:56.540 --> 30:00.426
Stop worrying about Tom. Tom has
a trust fund, a job, friends,

30:00.427 --> 30:04.281
he's going to be fine, I'm
more worried about Ashley.

30:04.282 --> 30:06.281
She dropped out of high
school and got a GED,

30:06.282 --> 30:08.345
and now she's insisting on going
to some college in Florida

30:08.346 --> 30:10.521
that lets in people with GEDs.

30:10.522 --> 30:12.921
She doesn't have any money,
doesn't like to work at anything,

30:12.922 --> 30:14.405
she doesn't like people...

30:14.507 --> 30:16.276
I don't know what's gonna happen to her.

30:16.747 --> 30:18.426
And Amy, she's a senior in high school

30:18.427 --> 30:19.802
with a two-year-old, engaged to be married

30:19.803 --> 30:21.322
to the first guy she ever had sex with.

30:21.323 --> 30:23.183
What are the chances of that working out?

30:23.184 --> 30:26.888
Uh, George, you were the first
guy I ever had sex with.

30:26.889 --> 30:31.417
Oops, forgot about that. Not
about us having sex, but that.

30:31.418 --> 30:35.401
Sex with you was always fun,
George, even the first time.

30:35.402 --> 30:37.220
Really? Really.

30:37.946 --> 30:38.954
You wouldn't want to...

30:38.955 --> 30:41.418
Not right now, not any time
in the next few months,

30:41.419 --> 30:42.394
not until I'm divorced,

30:42.395 --> 30:45.418
and we see if we're really interested

30:45.419 --> 30:46.873
in a relationship with each other.

30:46.874 --> 30:48.212
I'm interested.

30:57.767 --> 31:00.673
Well, I guess this is the last one.

31:03.587 --> 31:05.218
I guess I'll see you on Monday.

31:05.219 --> 31:06.508
I quit.

31:13.859 --> 31:18.941
Don't quit, Tom, I need you.
The company needs you.

31:19.315 --> 31:21.362
Look, she was gonna move in
a couple of weeks anyway.

31:21.363 --> 31:23.564
The apartment's all ready.

31:23.634 --> 31:26.193
This is a big deal to Rachel,

31:26.194 --> 31:28.241
living on her own in a decent place

31:28.242 --> 31:30.668
that she's providing for her children.

31:30.669 --> 31:33.436
And she couldn't have done
that without you, Tom.

31:33.437 --> 31:35.260
You helped her get back on her feet.

31:35.261 --> 31:38.555
Plus, you practically
introduced the two of us,

31:38.556 --> 31:42.196
and we're forever going to
be indebted to you for that.

31:42.197 --> 31:43.462
You know that?

31:44.776 --> 31:46.567
All right, you can quit if you want,

31:46.908 --> 31:48.412
but you have to come back.

31:48.413 --> 31:50.871
I'm just gonna get in
trouble without you.

31:52.365 --> 31:54.923
You should at least go out and
say goodbye to the children.

31:54.924 --> 31:56.731
I know that you'll see them again,

31:56.732 --> 31:59.739
and Rachel wants to see you and
wants you to see them again,

31:59.740 --> 32:02.875
but tonight, Tom, you should go out there

32:02.876 --> 32:07.382
and you should say goodbye
or goodnight or something.

32:08.109 --> 32:11.319
It's hard for all of us
to get used to changes,

32:12.555 --> 32:14.646
especially when it comes to people.

32:18.338 --> 32:19.628
Take your time.

32:32.878 --> 32:34.264
Want me to get that?

32:34.878 --> 32:36.680
No, I'll get it.

32:37.198 --> 32:38.488
Come in!

32:40.895 --> 32:41.822
Hello.

32:41.823 --> 32:43.097
Hello.

32:45.408 --> 32:47.458
I take it you're Omar.

32:47.459 --> 32:49.538
Yeah, and I guess you must be Ben.

32:49.539 --> 32:52.829
I must be. So... What's going on?

32:53.538 --> 32:57.153
We're just hanging out,
waiting for you to drop by.

32:57.154 --> 32:58.657
I told you I was gonna drop by,

32:58.658 --> 32:59.679
but I didn't know there

32:59.680 --> 33:01.618
were going to be other people here, but...

33:01.619 --> 33:04.161
But I didn't either.

33:04.162 --> 33:05.905
If Adrian is going to be
a part of your life,

33:05.906 --> 33:07.953
then I wanted to get to know Adrian.

33:07.954 --> 33:09.419
And now that you've gotten
to know me a little better,

33:09.420 --> 33:10.668
you still want to bea part of it?

33:10.669 --> 33:11.656
I know I wouldn't.

33:11.657 --> 33:14.666
Well, again. If you're going
to be a part of Ben's life.

33:14.667 --> 33:16.058
I am Ben's girlfriend.

33:16.059 --> 33:17.401
Yes, you are.

33:17.402 --> 33:19.257
And I am his ex-wife.

33:19.258 --> 33:20.937
Ex. Ex-wife.

33:20.938 --> 33:23.097
See, I told you she didn't need you.

33:23.098 --> 33:24.565
Look at this guy.

33:24.566 --> 33:27.382
Omar, you are so handsome, and smart,

33:27.383 --> 33:30.022
and more than capable of handling Adrian

33:30.023 --> 33:32.543
crying on your big, broad shoulders.

33:32.645 --> 33:33.765
She doesn't cry.

33:33.766 --> 33:34.654
I don't cry.

33:34.655 --> 33:37.228
Oh, come on, you sometimes cry.

33:37.229 --> 33:40.092
And I know I feel like crying right now.
There's no food?

33:40.093 --> 33:41.554
I wasn't planning on entertaining.

33:41.555 --> 33:42.556
I'll go get us something to eat.

33:42.557 --> 33:43.499
We can get delivery.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.148
No, I want to get out. I'll go.

33:45.149 --> 33:46.204
Dylan, you stay here.

33:46.205 --> 33:47.479
Really? Because...

33:47.480 --> 33:49.872
Because if you leave, he might
not come back with the food.

33:49.873 --> 33:52.224
He might not. See you, sweetie.

33:52.225 --> 33:53.808
Any requests?

33:53.809 --> 33:55.348
You know what I like.
You know what I like.

33:55.848 --> 33:57.138
Oh, geez.

33:58.504 --> 34:01.288
Just go over there and babysit,
and let the man get out.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.952
What makes you think
he's not out right now?

34:02.953 --> 34:04.231
Uh, you dumped a baby in

34:04.232 --> 34:05.658
his arms in the middle of the afternoon

34:05.659 --> 34:06.921
at someone else's house?

34:06.922 --> 34:09.817
He deserved it, he dumped
him in my arms first.

34:09.818 --> 34:11.592
He and Wife Number One are disgusting!

34:11.594 --> 34:13.161
He's just trying to have sex with her!

34:13.161 --> 34:14.404
Who wouldn't?

34:14.819 --> 34:16.818
I wouldn't, not me, but who else wouldn't?

34:16.819 --> 34:18.274
She's a really good looking woman,

34:18.275 --> 34:20.018
and she has a really great voice, and...

34:20.020 --> 34:21.790
Shut up! What?

34:22.179 --> 34:23.427
It doesn't take anything away

34:23.428 --> 34:25.539
from your mom for Grace's
mom to be attractive.

34:25.540 --> 34:26.835
Your mom's attractive too.

34:26.835 --> 34:28.643
Say something about my mother's voice.

34:28.645 --> 34:30.804
She's got a great voice. And she can sing.

34:30.806 --> 34:33.284
And hey, my mom thinks
she's smart and attractive,

34:33.284 --> 34:34.851
and a whole bunch of other good things.

34:34.853 --> 34:37.219
Ugh! I don't want your mother
to find my mother smart

34:37.221 --> 34:38.963
and attractive, and a
bunch of other things.

34:38.964 --> 34:40.610
I don't either, I told her I don't.

34:40.612 --> 34:42.659
Your mom is off limits to my mom.

34:42.659 --> 34:45.507
Oh, but my dad isn't off
limits to Grace's mom?

34:45.509 --> 34:47.428
He's just trying to sleep with her.

34:47.429 --> 34:49.780
Amy, maybe your dad is
just comfortable with her

34:49.781 --> 34:51.331
because they know each other so well,

34:51.333 --> 34:52.706
they're so familiar with each other.

34:52.708 --> 34:55.763
It might not be just about the
sex, maybe it's about comfort.

34:55.764 --> 34:57.987
Oh, please. It's always
just about the sex.

34:57.988 --> 34:59.955
Are you with me just for the sex?

34:59.956 --> 35:01.812
Would you be with me if
we weren't having sex?

35:01.813 --> 35:04.100
I was with you for a long
time without having sex.

35:04.101 --> 35:06.099
And I thought we had this
all settled last night,

35:06.100 --> 35:07.063
I thought you were okay

35:07.064 --> 35:09.191
with your dad doing
whatever makes him happy.

35:09.192 --> 35:10.658
Where'd you get that?

35:10.664 --> 35:12.018
Subtext?

35:13.297 --> 35:15.583
I'm starving, can we just
get something to eat?

35:15.584 --> 35:17.824
No, we can't. John just went to bed.

35:17.825 --> 35:19.796
But if you tell me what you want,

35:19.797 --> 35:21.188
I'll go get us something to eat.

35:21.189 --> 35:23.059
I don't know, okay? Okay.

35:23.060 --> 35:26.526
I'll go. I want to get out of here anyway.

35:28.436 --> 35:31.092
I wish my mother was here, so
I'd have someone to talk to.

35:31.093 --> 35:32.692
You never talk to your mother.

35:32.693 --> 35:34.959
Yeah. I'm gonna talk to
her when she gets home.

35:41.476 --> 35:43.651
This is the longest summer of my life.

35:43.652 --> 35:45.486
And I don't mean that in a good way.

35:46.084 --> 35:47.390
I heard that.

35:51.281 --> 35:53.227
Tom, come on, let's go for a ride.

35:53.377 --> 35:55.275
Jacob wants to see where Dad was buried.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.858
He doesn't know where Dad was buried.

35:59.632 --> 36:01.898
I'd really like to see
where he was buried.

36:02.368 --> 36:04.704
He wasn't buried.

36:04.705 --> 36:07.460
Tom! Let's not tell him
anything else, come on.

36:07.461 --> 36:08.470
No.

36:08.471 --> 36:10.676
All right, well, if you don't want to go,

36:10.677 --> 36:13.262
then I guess we'll just go without you.

36:13.284 --> 36:14.243
Go.

36:14.244 --> 36:15.843
Come on. Come on.

36:15.844 --> 36:16.899
No.

36:16.900 --> 36:19.518
You always said Dad
haunted this guest house.

36:19.525 --> 36:20.788
If you want to stay out here,

36:20.789 --> 36:22.463
we'll let you stay out here.

36:34.099 --> 36:35.565
Again?

36:36.883 --> 36:39.537
I need to go somewhere. I
don't need to go somewhere.

36:39.538 --> 36:41.537
I want to go somewhere, I want
to go back over to Kathleen's.

36:41.538 --> 36:42.194
George...

36:42.195 --> 36:44.241
I need you to hang out in
my room while I'm gone.

36:44.242 --> 36:45.697
I need you to listen for Robie.

36:45.698 --> 36:47.712
If he cries, go pick him up and call me,

36:47.713 --> 36:49.392
I'll come home immediately. Promise.

36:49.393 --> 36:51.408
But I'm sure he'll be fine,
you'll both be fine.

36:51.409 --> 36:54.239
Oh no, no, George, you
only have another week.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.191
You'll be fine. I trust you.

36:56.192 --> 36:59.295
Well, don't trust me, that's a
heavy burden for a gal like me.

36:59.296 --> 37:03.071
Too bad. You're up to it.
You've changed your life.

37:03.072 --> 37:05.872
You never harmed Ricky, you're
sober, you've got a job.

37:05.873 --> 37:07.551
I trust you. Get in there.

37:07.552 --> 37:09.115
I don't know, George,

37:09.841 --> 37:12.159
I don't know if I can,
it's too much pressure.

37:12.160 --> 37:14.554
Get in there.

37:21.325 --> 37:22.567
Thank you.

37:23.389 --> 37:24.732
I won't let you down.

37:24.733 --> 37:26.030
I know you won't.

37:35.329 --> 37:36.795
Hi. Hi.

37:36.881 --> 37:38.640
Can I get a large cheese pizza,

37:38.641 --> 37:41.135
half meat lovers special please, to go?

37:41.136 --> 37:44.239
You got it, doll. Just wait
over there about 15 minutes.

37:44.240 --> 37:45.514
Thanks.

37:47.296 --> 37:51.440
Oh. Hi. Two nights in a row.

37:51.441 --> 37:55.579
Yeah. But at least this is
neutral territory, huh?

37:58.398 --> 37:59.736
Yeah.

37:59.790 --> 38:03.789
Sorry about last night, I
wouldn't have dropped by

38:03.790 --> 38:05.790
if I had known you and Ricky
were having an argument.

38:05.791 --> 38:07.374
Oh, we weren't having an argument.

38:07.375 --> 38:08.382
No?

38:08.383 --> 38:10.061
No. We weren't having an argument,

38:10.062 --> 38:13.006
we were having a relationship.

38:13.007 --> 38:14.173
You know how it is.

38:14.174 --> 38:15.512
I know how it is.

38:17.566 --> 38:19.469
So, what are you doing here?
Where's Dylan?

38:19.470 --> 38:21.725
Dylan is hanging out with Adrian.

38:21.726 --> 38:22.557
What?

38:22.558 --> 38:27.353
Adrian and Omar. I'm picking
up pizza for the four of us.

38:27.359 --> 38:30.633
The divorce is official, so
now we're double dating.

38:31.130 --> 38:32.041
Wow.

38:32.042 --> 38:33.977
Hey, we were double dating
with you and Ricky last night.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.065
That was not a date.

38:35.066 --> 38:38.697
Speaking of dates, how's that
coming, the wedding date?

38:38.698 --> 38:42.202
Oh, I don't know, I don't
want to set a date.

38:42.203 --> 38:44.586
I mean, I'm going to marry Ricky, I am,

38:44.587 --> 38:47.674
it's just... Things are too
crazy right now with my family.

38:47.675 --> 38:50.004
Well, that won't change.

38:50.250 --> 38:52.708
Yeah, I just don't want
to rush into anything.

38:52.810 --> 38:54.084
Like I did?

38:54.330 --> 38:56.665
Are you talking about with
us or you and Adrian?

38:56.666 --> 38:59.637
Both. Neither.

38:59.675 --> 39:02.643
No, both. Plus Dylan.

39:02.681 --> 39:04.760
Make it three. What is wrong with me?

39:04.761 --> 39:06.056
You are a romantic.

39:06.057 --> 39:07.816
I was a nerd a few years ago.

39:07.817 --> 39:09.251
So was I.

39:11.348 --> 39:13.567
Hey, Slim, your pizza's ready!

39:18.485 --> 39:21.375
I could wait with you, if you want.

39:25.591 --> 39:27.028
Hey, Tom, heard you're moving.

39:27.029 --> 39:30.383
Jack! Come on in.

39:30.533 --> 39:33.807
Don't just come in, move in.

39:34.290 --> 39:37.490
I can't, Tom, it was a
good time but I can't.

39:37.491 --> 39:39.746
I got my dad and mom to
move back into town

39:39.747 --> 39:41.650
just so I can live with them, so...

39:41.651 --> 39:42.706
I can't.

39:42.707 --> 39:46.444
How about I move over there?

39:46.445 --> 39:48.505
Your mom wants you in the house.

39:49.308 --> 39:50.807
You drove the car?

39:51.695 --> 39:53.788
I'm just glad you didn't get hurt.

39:53.789 --> 39:55.959
And I'm glad you didn't hurt anyone.

39:56.237 --> 39:58.268
Hey, you're gonna love living
in your old room again.

39:58.269 --> 40:00.060
That's a great room. I miss it.

40:00.061 --> 40:01.532
You can have it.

40:01.533 --> 40:03.581
No, really, I'm back in my old room again,

40:03.582 --> 40:05.509
and it's like being with an old friend.

40:07.469 --> 40:09.543
You remember when you hit
me with that football?

40:10.647 --> 40:14.225
Life is like that. It
hits you where it hurts,

40:14.679 --> 40:16.053
but a few ice packs later,

40:16.054 --> 40:19.345
you get over it and you get up again.

40:19.590 --> 40:22.609
That was a good throw.

40:23.479 --> 40:24.624
Yeah.

40:25.925 --> 40:28.312
Okay, this is totally cool.

40:28.734 --> 40:31.497
Yeah, my dad used to take me
to the club all the time.

40:31.711 --> 40:33.305
We belonged to a club, too.

40:33.711 --> 40:35.006
We belonged to two clubs.

40:35.007 --> 40:37.134
See, ours was much bigger than this,

40:37.135 --> 40:39.193
and giraffes roamed the fairways.

40:39.951 --> 40:41.432
Is that true? No.

40:42.654 --> 40:44.190
I was just trying to
compete with you again.

40:44.191 --> 40:48.494
Although I'm not sure that I can
top, "I love your continent."

40:48.495 --> 40:52.393
Yeah, well, I just didn't
really know what else to say.

40:56.207 --> 40:58.536
So, how did my dad meet your mom?

41:00.575 --> 41:02.973
Your mom thinks he met her

41:02.974 --> 41:04.640
nine months before I was born,

41:04.641 --> 41:06.869
so why don't we just leave it at that.

41:06.870 --> 41:07.908
Is that a lie?

41:07.909 --> 41:09.140
It's more an assumption.

41:09.141 --> 41:12.335
She assumed that and
we didn't correct her.

41:12.452 --> 41:15.199
My father, I'm sorry...

41:16.115 --> 41:18.930
Our father, he met my mom

41:18.931 --> 41:20.386
when they were in med school.

41:20.387 --> 41:23.005
But my father was already a
doctor when he met my mother.

41:23.875 --> 41:25.133
That's what I'm saying.

41:25.186 --> 41:25.986
What?

41:25.987 --> 41:27.997
He knew my mother first.

41:28.515 --> 41:29.794
They talked about getting married,

41:29.795 --> 41:32.706
they didn't get married, she
went back home to South Africa.

41:32.707 --> 41:36.413
And years later, they ran
into each other again.

41:40.079 --> 41:42.557
I don't know if that makes
this better or worse.

41:42.558 --> 41:44.248
Or just more complicated.

41:47.631 --> 41:49.017
Thanks for telling me.

41:50.111 --> 41:53.577
Sure. Now, you tell me
something that I didn't know.

41:55.598 --> 41:58.339
Well, it's gonna be hard to top that, but

42:01.369 --> 42:04.498
I think my mother is
interested in her ex-husband.

42:04.777 --> 42:08.467
Yeah, I knew that. I saw the look.

42:10.581 --> 42:11.832
I don't really like him that much,

42:11.833 --> 42:14.271
but I feel bad for my mom, you know?

42:14.276 --> 42:16.606
After everything that
happened with my dad,

42:16.709 --> 42:18.655
and now, she and Jeff...

42:18.981 --> 42:20.644
I just think she and Jeff made a mistake,

42:20.645 --> 42:22.463
you know? It was too soon.

42:24.373 --> 42:25.839
What's your mother like?

42:26.165 --> 42:29.231
What's my mom like? She's amazing.

42:29.989 --> 42:31.635
But you know who she is.

42:31.636 --> 42:35.167
I don't know who she is. What
do you mean, I know who she is?

42:35.717 --> 42:38.191
You know who Oprah is, don't you?

42:38.581 --> 42:40.927
The lady who started all
the schools in Africa?

42:41.765 --> 42:43.790
Your mom is Oprah?

42:45.957 --> 42:48.911
My father slept with Oprah Winfrey?

42:49.045 --> 42:50.319
I'm just joking.

42:50.484 --> 42:52.511
Oprah never went to med school.

42:52.901 --> 42:54.241
I know.

42:56.586 --> 42:58.051
I'm an idiot.

42:58.377 --> 42:59.811
Runs in the family.
