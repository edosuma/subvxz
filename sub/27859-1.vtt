01:37.029 --> 01:38.898
It's so beautiful.

01:55.848 --> 01:57.750
Hello.

02:17.870 --> 02:20.607
- Good morning, miss!
- Good morning.

02:22.674 --> 02:26.309
- Good morning, Melody.
- Everything looks so wonderful

02:26.311 --> 02:27.410
Thank you, dear.

02:31.750 --> 02:35.918
Good morning, Mrs. Potterson.
Those buns smell wonderful.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.321
May I have some, please?

02:37.323 --> 02:38.888
Of course.
Just a couple?

02:38.890 --> 02:40.791
Yes, please.

02:44.662 --> 02:47.497
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:49.501 --> 02:50.701
Huh?

02:52.837 --> 02:54.704
Hey, watch out!

02:54.706 --> 02:56.608
Crazy kids.

02:58.811 --> 03:00.610
Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:00.612 --> 03:02.411
Where do you think
you're going?

03:02.413 --> 03:04.581
Don't give me
those puppy dog eyes.

03:04.583 --> 03:06.982
I think he's got his sights
on those shiny apples of yours.

03:06.984 --> 03:08.851
I think you're right.

03:08.853 --> 03:11.554
Here's one for you, miss,
on the house.

03:11.556 --> 03:13.589
- Thanks.
- Not for you.

03:18.097 --> 03:20.063
Now, back in those days,

03:20.065 --> 03:24.667
everyone would sing the song
with thankful hearts.

03:24.669 --> 03:26.837
It was a simple song,

03:26.839 --> 03:29.539
simple enough
for anyone to learn.

03:29.541 --> 03:33.709
But it was different,
not like any other song,

03:33.711 --> 03:36.646
for it had amazing power.

03:36.648 --> 03:38.881
- Power?
- What kind of power?

03:38.883 --> 03:40.416
Was it magical?

03:40.418 --> 03:42.719
Yes, but not simple magic

03:42.721 --> 03:45.422
like pixie dust
or tricks to the eye.

03:45.424 --> 03:47.958
The song was true magic

03:47.960 --> 03:51.595
because it could actually
change hearts.

03:51.597 --> 03:52.896
What?

03:52.898 --> 03:55.631
The song could bring hope
to despair,

03:55.633 --> 03:57.934
light to darkness,

03:57.936 --> 04:00.570
even change sad to glad.

04:00.572 --> 04:02.071
- Really?
- Wow.

04:02.073 --> 04:03.974
Where did the song
come from?

04:03.976 --> 04:06.475
Well, it was a gift, you see.

04:06.477 --> 04:08.511
A gift?
You mean like a present?

04:08.513 --> 04:11.981
Yes, from the great
Giver of Gifts.

04:11.983 --> 04:15.452
And in the beginning,
everyone was thankful

04:15.454 --> 04:16.987
and loved the song.

04:16.988 --> 04:19.488
But that was before Dracon.

04:19.491 --> 04:20.656
Dracon?

04:20.659 --> 04:22.893
Mm, Dracon.

04:22.895 --> 04:26.061
He was once a noble guardian
of the song,

04:26.063 --> 04:30.434
a knight sworn to love
and protect it.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.770
When Dracon sang the song,
it was wonderful.

04:33.772 --> 04:38.775
His voice was like
a symphony of one.

04:38.777 --> 04:42.946
But Dracon became prideful
and wanted to use the song

04:42.948 --> 04:46.215
to gain power and praise
for himself.

04:46.217 --> 04:49.518
This led him
on a path into darkness

04:49.520 --> 04:51.754
and away from the light.

04:51.756 --> 04:55.592
He tried to use sorcery
to steal the song's power,

04:55.594 --> 04:59.896
but a deep magic in the song
prevented this from happening.

04:59.898 --> 05:03.099
Mm, ah, yes!

05:06.237 --> 05:09.605
When Dracon realized he
could not have what he wanted,

05:09.607 --> 05:12.177
his heart was filled
with hate.

05:14.580 --> 05:17.980
And he vowed to make all
who loved the song his enemy

05:17.982 --> 05:20.717
or his slaves.

05:20.719 --> 05:22.718
- Slaves?
- Oh, my!

05:22.720 --> 05:23.787
He's bad.

05:23.789 --> 05:25.956
Far worse than bad.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.657
Dracon was evil.

05:27.659 --> 05:29.124
Then what happened?

05:29.126 --> 05:32.761
Well, there was no telling
what he would do next,

05:32.763 --> 05:35.232
and so the Giver
dispatched Michael,

05:35.234 --> 05:38.167
a faithful guardian
of the song,

05:38.169 --> 05:40.672
to find Dracon and stop him.

05:43.941 --> 05:46.675
The Giver gave Michael
a special gift...

05:46.677 --> 05:51.715
armor and a sword that could
defeat the powers of darkness.

05:51.717 --> 05:55.085
Dracon, your wicked scheme
has come undone.

05:55.087 --> 05:56.886
Surrender yourself.

05:56.888 --> 06:01.223
I pray there may yet be a trace
of mercy set aside for you.

06:04.897 --> 06:06.662
Mercy.

06:06.664 --> 06:10.232
You come offering mercy to me?

06:10.234 --> 06:11.800
With a sword?

06:11.802 --> 06:13.770
Are we to be brothers again?

06:13.772 --> 06:15.538
That's close enough.

06:15.540 --> 06:19.141
But I want us to be close,
like old times.

06:19.143 --> 06:21.845
I want you to understand.

06:21.847 --> 06:25.184
I don't need mercy from you
or the Giver!

06:29.253 --> 06:31.787
What are you doing?

06:31.789 --> 06:35.158
You've changed, Dracon.
The darkness has blinded you.

06:35.160 --> 06:39.696
You are wrong! My eyes have
been opened in the darkness.

06:39.698 --> 06:41.297
I see clearly now.

06:41.299 --> 06:43.999
Here in the shadows,
there are secrets and power

06:44.001 --> 06:46.869
beyond anything
you could imagine.

06:46.871 --> 06:50.809
It is you who have been
blinded by the light!

06:52.244 --> 06:53.946
Goodbye, old friend.

07:00.719 --> 07:02.285
Get out of my way.

07:02.287 --> 07:04.186
I cannot let you pass.

07:04.188 --> 07:07.924
Fine! Then you shall be
the first to fall.

07:12.631 --> 07:15.631
Dracon, what have you done?

07:49.367 --> 07:51.703
Look, Dad, a falling star.

08:10.855 --> 08:13.658
The Guardians of Light.

08:27.239 --> 08:28.771
Here!

08:30.941 --> 08:33.808
Dracon, for your rebellion
against the Giver,

08:33.811 --> 08:37.414
you are hereby banished
to the depths of the Earth.

08:37.416 --> 08:40.352
Forever is the song
and the light!

08:49.326 --> 08:52.161
And so Michael banished Dracon

08:52.163 --> 08:54.963
to the depths
of the deep mountain cave,

08:54.965 --> 08:58.200
there to remain
a prisoner forever.

08:58.202 --> 09:00.035
Forever?

09:00.037 --> 09:03.139
Well, as long as there were
believers to sing the song,

09:03.141 --> 09:06.175
Dracon was powerless
to escape his prison.

09:06.177 --> 09:09.045
Is it true the song
makes the blue daisies grow?

09:09.047 --> 09:11.414
Yes! The blue daisies
are a sign

09:11.416 --> 09:14.049
of all those
who believe in the song.

09:14.051 --> 09:15.418
I believe, Nicholai.

09:15.420 --> 09:17.853
- Yeah, me too.
- We all believe.

09:17.855 --> 09:21.757
That's... That's wonderful!

09:21.759 --> 09:23.926
I am Michael,
defender of the realm.

09:23.928 --> 09:26.228
I can defeat
the evil Dracon, yeah!

09:28.200 --> 09:30.333
Yeah! Fight the dragon!

09:30.335 --> 09:33.236
Can you teach us the song,
Nicholai?

09:33.238 --> 09:34.503
Yes, will you, please?

09:34.505 --> 09:37.073
Of course I will.

09:37.075 --> 09:38.875
You'll do no such thing!

09:38.877 --> 09:40.275
You're frightening
the children again

09:40.277 --> 09:42.312
with your wild stories,
aren't you?

09:42.314 --> 09:44.146
- Move along, children.
- And don't let me catch you

09:44.148 --> 09:46.116
listening
to that old fool again.

09:46.118 --> 09:47.784
Aww.

09:47.786 --> 09:49.486
Sorry, Nicholai.

09:49.488 --> 09:52.354
- But I like the story.
- Me too!

09:52.356 --> 09:54.891
I meant no harm.
I was just...

09:54.893 --> 09:57.025
Fill their heads
with wild imaginings

09:57.027 --> 09:58.828
and that old religion!

09:58.830 --> 10:00.929

It's okay, dear.

12:04.221 --> 12:06.521
No harm done.
They're just trying to...

12:06.523 --> 12:09.094
What's the matter
with all of you?

12:12.062 --> 12:13.963
Are you all right, Nicholai?

12:13.965 --> 12:15.899
I'm fine, dear.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.333
You should all be
ashamed of yourselves.

12:18.335 --> 12:20.602
He wasn't doing
anything wrong.

12:20.604 --> 12:23.106
He was just trying to show you
the truth about...

12:23.108 --> 12:25.641
It's all right, Melody.
It's over now.

12:25.643 --> 12:28.113
Let's just go home.

12:31.148 --> 12:32.283
Oh, my!

12:33.484 --> 12:35.253
All right, I'm leaving!

12:40.992 --> 12:43.059
Why didn't you fight back?

12:43.061 --> 12:47.329
They're our friends.
I have no quarrel with them.

12:47.331 --> 12:49.966
You call them friends?

12:49.968 --> 12:52.501
I'm trying to be
their friend, yes.

12:52.503 --> 12:56.506
Not all battles are won
with a sword.

12:56.508 --> 12:58.141
Read. You'll see.

12:58.143 --> 13:01.243
- I love you, Nicholai.
- I love you too.

13:01.245 --> 13:05.080
And don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

13:05.082 --> 13:07.250
Now, I have work to do.

13:07.252 --> 13:10.185
I've uncovered
another section of the wall.

13:10.187 --> 13:12.157
- Okay, see you later.
- All right.

13:21.465 --> 13:22.665
Come on, Hunter.
Move it, boy.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.503
Let's get him!

13:44.089 --> 13:45.657
Whoa!

13:49.594 --> 13:52.564
Come on, boys,
this is too easy.

13:57.099 --> 13:58.703
- Thanks, Mrs. Potterson!
- Leif!

14:04.308 --> 14:05.775
You call that fighting?

14:05.777 --> 14:07.312
Take that!

14:09.114 --> 14:11.115
You guys are lame!

14:15.152 --> 14:18.621
- Ah! Oh! Get off me!
- They're pecking me!

14:18.623 --> 14:21.256
What's the matter?
You guys chicken?

14:21.258 --> 14:23.061
Buk, buk, buk, bawk!

14:29.801 --> 14:33.368
Shh. Quiet, Hunter.
We'll ambush 'em.

14:33.370 --> 14:35.975
Hmm?

14:40.110 --> 14:41.544
Hey!

14:41.546 --> 14:44.347
Don't worry, princess,
I'll defend you!

14:44.349 --> 14:47.116
Take that, you dirty dogs!

14:47.118 --> 14:48.383
Watch where you're going!

14:48.385 --> 14:49.618
Whoa!

14:49.620 --> 14:51.487
Thanks.

14:51.489 --> 14:56.125
If you step on those daisies,
you'll be in big trouble.

14:56.127 --> 14:58.093
Hey, watch it!

14:58.095 --> 14:59.529
My flowers!

14:59.531 --> 15:01.798
Now you're in for it.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.467
- Hah! Yah!
- Hey!

15:04.469 --> 15:07.406
That's mine! Give it back!

15:10.274 --> 15:11.808
Yikes!
That girl's crazy!

15:11.810 --> 15:14.345
And keep off my flowers!

15:16.114 --> 15:17.780
Wow.

15:27.225 --> 15:29.458
Whoa. How did you do that?

15:29.460 --> 15:31.761
No more fighting
in my garden!

15:31.763 --> 15:34.396
No, really, that thing you did
with the flowers,

15:34.398 --> 15:35.765
is that a trick?

15:35.767 --> 15:37.567
Guess again.

15:37.569 --> 15:40.870
Ah! You're pretty good
with that broom, you know.

15:40.872 --> 15:43.839
Nice fighting you,
but I've got stuff to do.

15:43.841 --> 15:46.809
Hey, wait, wait,
what kind of stuff?

15:46.811 --> 15:48.544
Stay, boy.

15:48.546 --> 15:50.579
You sure
ask a lot of questions.

15:50.581 --> 15:52.714
I thought this old place
was abandoned.

15:52.716 --> 15:54.150
What do you do in here?

15:54.152 --> 15:56.285
I live here
with my grandpa now.

15:56.287 --> 15:58.420
Huh? What is this place?

15:58.422 --> 15:59.889
Don't you know anything?

15:59.891 --> 16:02.791
This is Sanctuary,
the old meeting place.

16:02.793 --> 16:04.660
Meeting place? For what?

16:04.662 --> 16:06.328
People did lots of things here:

16:06.330 --> 16:09.598
talking, singing,
searching for stuff.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.534
What kind of stuff?

16:11.536 --> 16:14.237
Oh, an excellent question,
young man.

16:14.239 --> 16:15.771
Hi, Nicholai.

16:15.773 --> 16:18.440
There's a wonderful story
hidden in these walls,

16:18.442 --> 16:20.443
and I'm going to find it.

16:20.445 --> 16:22.812
It's been hiding here
for years.

16:22.814 --> 16:24.613
Hey, look, your trick flowers.

16:24.615 --> 16:27.683
Blue daisies, boy,
and they're not a trick.

16:27.685 --> 16:29.886
- They're a promise.
- Huh?

16:29.888 --> 16:31.521
Yes, a promise.

16:31.523 --> 16:33.689
As long as the blue daisies
are here,

16:33.691 --> 16:37.693
everything is as it should be,
and our world is safe.

16:37.695 --> 16:39.828
Safe? From what?

16:39.830 --> 16:41.429
Why, the dragon, of course.

16:41.431 --> 16:43.665
The dragon. Of course!

16:43.667 --> 16:45.800
An ice dragon, to be precise.

16:45.802 --> 16:49.838
Very dangerous
and very clever.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.909
Wait, you actually
believe that stuff?

16:52.911 --> 16:55.243
What else would you believe?

16:55.245 --> 16:58.180
Okay, well, hey,
that's really interesting.

16:58.182 --> 16:59.781
Melody, I've gotta go now,

16:59.783 --> 17:03.285
leave you two to do
whatever you are doing.

17:03.287 --> 17:04.953
Nice trick with
the flowers though.

17:04.954 --> 17:06.358
See ya!

17:07.590 --> 17:09.223
It's not a trick.

17:09.226 --> 17:11.226
The blue daisies
are a promise.

17:11.228 --> 17:12.595
And they have power.

17:12.597 --> 17:14.931
Flower power? Sounds girly.

17:14.933 --> 17:18.501
It's not. I can take you
to a secret place and show you,

17:18.502 --> 17:19.769
if you're not scared.

17:19.771 --> 17:22.637
Of what,
the flower monster?

17:22.638 --> 17:25.973
No, not the flower monster.

17:25.976 --> 17:27.809
The ice dragon.

17:27.810 --> 17:29.278
Yeah, you're scared.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.946
I understand.

17:30.948 --> 17:33.816
You don't have to go with me
tomorrow after breakfast,

17:33.818 --> 17:37.353
starting out by the town gate.

17:37.355 --> 17:39.825
Bye, Leif. Don't be late.

17:48.366 --> 17:49.932
Hunter, it's just a statue.

17:49.934 --> 17:52.803
Come on, boy.
We don't believe in dragons.

18:04.282 --> 18:06.382
Patience, Melody.

18:06.384 --> 18:08.917
He'll be here.

18:08.919 --> 18:10.855
Hey, you're not Leif.

18:11.888 --> 18:13.859
Stay here, boy.

18:29.573 --> 18:31.840
Leif, are you okay?

18:31.842 --> 18:33.975
Talk to me!

18:33.977 --> 18:35.511
Please say something!
Leif!

18:37.348 --> 18:38.681
Gotcha!

18:38.683 --> 18:41.884
Aw, Hunter, cut it out!
Come on!

18:41.886 --> 18:43.953
Hunter, really, I'm okay.

18:43.955 --> 18:46.021
I guess we're even.

18:46.023 --> 18:48.624
Yeah, well,
we'll have to see about that.

18:48.626 --> 18:51.860
Come on,
we've got a ways to go.

18:51.862 --> 18:53.529
Lead on, princess.

18:53.531 --> 18:55.865
Will you stop calling me that?

18:55.867 --> 18:57.633
As you command.

19:01.805 --> 19:05.540
I'm really happy you decided
to come along, Leif.

19:05.542 --> 19:07.710
Are we there yet?

19:07.712 --> 19:09.645
Not yet.

19:09.647 --> 19:12.815
Hey, I know this place.

19:12.817 --> 19:15.518
These stones always
creeped me out as a kid.

19:15.520 --> 19:18.857
They're echo stones.
They're guardians of the song.

19:21.859 --> 19:23.792
Leif!

19:23.794 --> 19:27.596
Leif! Leif!

19:27.598 --> 19:29.831
See what I mean? Stop it.
It's creeping me out.

19:29.833 --> 19:32.003
Scaredy cat.

19:38.475 --> 19:39.974
Come on, this way.

19:39.976 --> 19:42.546
Hunter, let's go, boy!

19:45.882 --> 19:48.719
This is where
the mountain path is hidden.

19:52.924 --> 19:56.125
- Are we there yet?
- Will you stop asking me that?

19:56.127 --> 19:58.894
Well, are we?

19:58.896 --> 20:01.664
Almost.

20:01.666 --> 20:03.068
They're almost gone,
you know.

20:04.099 --> 20:05.967
- What's almost gone?
- The blue daisies.

20:05.969 --> 20:08.570
The ones around Sanctuary
are all that's left.

20:08.572 --> 20:09.771
In the village, at least.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.540
Nicholai says it's because

20:11.542 --> 20:13.075
no one believes
in the song anymore.

20:13.077 --> 20:15.010
What do you think?

20:15.012 --> 20:16.580
I think he's right.

20:17.948 --> 20:19.749
Look, we're here.

20:19.751 --> 20:21.586
Finally.

20:27.859 --> 20:28.960
Follow me.

20:30.695 --> 20:32.864
Uh, Melody?

20:33.865 --> 20:35.530
This way.

20:35.532 --> 20:39.068
Whoa.
How'd you find this place?

20:39.070 --> 20:40.603
Nicholai showed me.

20:40.605 --> 20:42.708
He comes up here often
to think and pray.

20:44.675 --> 20:46.142
This is it!

20:46.144 --> 20:49.748
The blue fields!

20:52.149 --> 20:53.848
Sweet.

20:53.850 --> 20:55.584
Where's the blue?

20:55.586 --> 20:57.153
You need to do
the magic dance.

20:57.155 --> 20:59.954
Really? I can do it.
I want to do it.

20:59.956 --> 21:03.759
Okay. Hop on one leg
and stick out your tongue.

21:03.761 --> 21:05.761
Uh...

21:05.763 --> 21:07.797
Now make a beat.

21:07.799 --> 21:09.665
And spin around in circles.

21:11.168 --> 21:13.068
Keep trying.

21:13.070 --> 21:15.604
Faster!

21:16.974 --> 21:19.174
I can't do it.

21:19.176 --> 21:21.777
Aw, I was just
messing with you.

21:21.779 --> 21:24.946
It's not magic
or some kind of trick.

21:24.948 --> 21:26.682
It's the song.

21:26.684 --> 21:27.953
You sing the song.

22:56.206 --> 22:59.008
Sure, if they believe.

23:02.312 --> 23:05.079
Hunter, where you going?
Come back here!

23:05.081 --> 23:08.082
Wait! Don't go that way!
It's not safe!

23:08.084 --> 23:09.717
Hunter, come here, boy!

23:09.719 --> 23:11.956
Leif, wait for me!

23:42.619 --> 23:44.886
Hunter! Come here, boy!

23:44.888 --> 23:47.623
Leif, we should go back.

23:47.625 --> 23:49.591
We're not supposed to be here.

23:49.593 --> 23:52.360
Come on. What are you
afraid of, a dragon?

23:52.362 --> 23:54.262
Very funny.

23:54.264 --> 23:56.901
Let's just find Hunter quickly.

23:58.202 --> 24:01.604
Hunter, come here, boy!
Where is that pup?

24:01.606 --> 24:03.305
He was chasing
that little bird.

24:03.307 --> 24:06.678
Look, I can see more tracks.
Come on!

24:41.078 --> 24:42.744
- What was that?
- Huh?

24:42.746 --> 24:44.248
- It sounded like Hunter.
- Come on!

24:45.683 --> 24:47.649
Whoa!

24:47.651 --> 24:50.184
Gotcha.
That's one mean drop.

24:50.186 --> 24:52.154
Sure is. Thanks.

24:52.156 --> 24:53.422
Leif, look!

24:53.424 --> 24:55.257
Hunter's paw prints
end right here.

24:55.259 --> 24:57.826
- What?
- You don't think...

24:57.828 --> 24:59.127
No, it's all right.

24:59.129 --> 25:01.296
I can see his tracks
on the other side.

25:01.298 --> 25:03.866
- Thank goodness.
- Yeah.

25:03.868 --> 25:07.237
Just one problem:
How do we get across?

25:34.698 --> 25:37.031
- Whoa! You feel that?
- Yeah.

25:37.033 --> 25:39.334
Ah! It's an earthquake!

25:53.751 --> 25:56.385
Hey, come on,
we can get across.

25:56.387 --> 25:58.822
Okay, I'm right behind you.

26:02.827 --> 26:04.225
- Did you hear that?
- It's Hunter!

26:04.227 --> 26:05.229
Come on.

26:07.932 --> 26:10.168
It's dark in here.

26:12.002 --> 26:13.836
Leif, be careful!

26:13.838 --> 26:15.037
And hurry!

26:15.039 --> 26:16.771
I'm okay.

26:16.773 --> 26:18.409
Do you see him?

26:20.110 --> 26:23.180
Not yet.
This cave is so deep.

26:24.814 --> 26:27.116
What's happening down there?

26:27.118 --> 26:29.751
Leif?

26:29.753 --> 26:31.819
I'm still here,
but it's freezing.

26:31.821 --> 26:33.090
Whoa!

26:35.225 --> 26:39.427
Is everything okay?
I don't like this one bit.

26:41.165 --> 26:42.865
I can hear him.

26:45.503 --> 26:47.435
Getting close.

26:47.437 --> 26:49.840
Almost there.

26:52.009 --> 26:53.011
I'm coming, boy!

26:54.378 --> 26:56.110
Hunter, how'd you
get down there?

26:56.112 --> 26:57.412
Come on.

26:57.414 --> 26:58.880
Hup!

26:58.882 --> 26:59.984
Gotcha.

27:03.387 --> 27:05.220
Leif, you all right?

27:05.222 --> 27:07.422
I'm okay.

27:07.424 --> 27:08.490
Thanks, bud.

27:08.492 --> 27:10.829
Be careful.

27:12.830 --> 27:13.932
Hunter!

27:16.132 --> 27:19.001
You had me scared, boy.
Are you all right?

27:19.003 --> 27:20.935
No more bird-chasing for you.

27:20.937 --> 27:23.504
Leif, what was that sound?

27:23.506 --> 27:25.540
Some kind of wind
or something.

27:25.542 --> 27:28.476
Wind coming from
inside a cave?

27:28.478 --> 27:30.311
Well, what else could it be?

27:30.313 --> 27:32.815
Oh, now I get it.

27:32.817 --> 27:34.982
You think there's
something down there.

27:34.984 --> 27:37.219
Look, can we just leave now?

27:37.221 --> 27:39.924
As you wish, princess.

27:41.257 --> 27:42.793
Let's go, Hunter.

28:08.185 --> 28:09.917
It's late. I gotta go.

28:09.919 --> 28:11.922
- Me too.
- Bye, Leif.

28:13.557 --> 28:15.557
There you are.
Where have you been?

28:15.559 --> 28:18.993
Outside with Hunter,
that cute dog, and Leif.

28:18.995 --> 28:20.229
I'm getting tired.

28:20.231 --> 28:21.864
Must have been
all that fresh air.

28:21.866 --> 28:24.165
Gonna crash. Love you.

28:24.167 --> 28:26.036
Love you too.

28:39.049 --> 28:41.853
Hunter, get off me!

28:43.087 --> 28:44.155
What?

28:46.924 --> 28:48.991
Nicholai, come quick!

28:48.993 --> 28:50.959
It's snowing outside.

28:50.961 --> 28:52.560
Snow?

28:52.562 --> 28:55.597
That's not possible, unless...

28:55.599 --> 28:57.232
Unless what?

28:57.234 --> 28:59.401
I'm not certain yet,

28:59.403 --> 29:01.840
but I'm going to find out.

29:04.241 --> 29:07.445
Don't worry.
We'll be all right.

29:14.651 --> 29:17.286
Can you believe this?
This is awesome!

29:17.288 --> 29:19.387
It's a snow day
in the middle of summer!

29:19.389 --> 29:20.388
Yeah!

29:20.390 --> 29:23.357
Leif, do you see the snow?

29:23.359 --> 29:24.926
Guess where it came from.

29:24.928 --> 29:27.963
Uh, let's see,
like, maybe the sky?

29:27.965 --> 29:32.300
Come on! Don't you remember
yesterday, the cave?

29:32.302 --> 29:35.203
You don't mean
the dragon cave, do you?

29:35.205 --> 29:37.271
Leif told us you,
like, freaked out.

29:37.273 --> 29:39.206
I-I didn't mean to...

29:39.208 --> 29:41.443
What, be mean, make fun of me?

29:41.445 --> 29:43.211
Hey, we saw that...

29:43.213 --> 29:44.546
We didn't see anything, Mel.

29:44.548 --> 29:46.114
Look, this is awesome.

29:46.116 --> 29:47.683
Come on, let's have some fun!

29:47.685 --> 29:49.350
Whee!

29:49.352 --> 29:51.986
Leif, wait!

29:51.988 --> 29:54.522
Why does he make me so...

29:56.159 --> 29:58.263
Why won't he just
listen to me?

Nicholai, is that you?

33:36.914 --> 33:38.483
Hello?

33:44.487 --> 33:45.555
Nicholai?

34:09.346 --> 34:11.545
What?

34:11.547 --> 34:13.150
Oh, no!

34:26.630 --> 34:27.862
No!

34:27.864 --> 34:31.435
Stop! Stop it!
Get away!

34:54.824 --> 34:56.359
Whew!

34:57.427 --> 34:59.761
Oh, what a crazy dream!

34:59.763 --> 35:01.898
What are you doing here?

35:05.636 --> 35:08.036
Nicholai, I'm going
to the village.

35:08.038 --> 35:11.208
I promised Mrs. Potterson
I would help her this morning.

35:21.851 --> 35:23.451
What's the matter, boy?

35:23.453 --> 35:27.322
You miss Melody, don't you?

35:27.324 --> 35:29.891
Okay, okay, if you insist.

35:29.893 --> 35:32.293
Let's go find her.

35:32.295 --> 35:34.898
Ugh, this weather's crazy.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.970
This is the worst storm
in years.

35:42.605 --> 35:45.473
Honey, that's all the firewood
we have.

35:45.475 --> 35:48.813
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

35:50.746 --> 35:52.380
It's still early.

35:52.382 --> 35:54.452
She's probably at Sanctuary
with Nicholai.

35:57.788 --> 36:00.654
- Are you warm enough, Porky?
- The pig's got the right idea.

36:00.656 --> 36:02.389
Hey, Leif,
where are you off to?

36:02.391 --> 36:03.858
Uh, nowhere, really.

36:03.860 --> 36:06.527
You know, Hunter just wanted
to see Melody, so...

36:06.529 --> 36:10.498
Yeah, right.
We saw you two holding hands.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.534
And singing
your little love song.

36:12.536 --> 36:14.034
Aw, come on,
knock it off, guys.

36:14.036 --> 36:16.503

36:16.505 --> 36:17.672

36:24.880 --> 36:26.780
You two were meant
for each other.

36:26.782 --> 36:29.016

36:29.018 --> 36:31.886
Yeah, best buds forever,
right, Billy?

36:31.888 --> 36:33.554
Maybe not.

36:33.556 --> 36:34.558
Hey!

36:37.960 --> 36:40.128
Hello?

36:40.130 --> 36:41.732
Stay here, boy.

36:42.799 --> 36:44.099
Hello?

36:44.101 --> 36:45.567
Melody!

36:45.569 --> 36:47.735
Anyone here?

36:47.737 --> 36:51.905
Yes, yes, come in, come in,
but you'll find no one here

36:51.907 --> 36:56.043
but an old man with his head
buried in a book.

36:56.045 --> 36:57.645
Oh, hi, Nicholai.

36:57.647 --> 37:00.382
I was looking for Melody.
Have you seen her?

37:00.384 --> 37:01.983
Oh, she should be back soon.

37:01.985 --> 37:04.652
She was helping Mrs. Potterson
deliver some food

37:04.654 --> 37:06.654
to families in the village.

37:06.656 --> 37:09.623
The snow day was fun
while it lasted,

37:09.625 --> 37:13.628
but it's turning into
something very different.

37:13.630 --> 37:16.663
Yeah, the worst blizzard
in years, they say.

37:16.665 --> 37:19.701
In a thousand years,
I calculate.

37:19.703 --> 37:21.101
What are you looking at?

37:21.103 --> 37:23.670
Why, it's the song.

37:23.672 --> 37:26.674
It is? Let me see.

37:26.676 --> 37:29.811
"Giver of all gifts.
Love's eternal song.

37:29.813 --> 37:31.945
We are here for you."

37:31.947 --> 37:34.047
Wait a minute.
That's not the song.

37:34.049 --> 37:35.683
What do you mean?

37:35.685 --> 37:38.585
Well, Melody sang the song
in the blue fields,

37:38.587 --> 37:39.987
and it was way different.

37:39.989 --> 37:42.456
They can't both be the song,
can they?

37:42.458 --> 37:44.025
Of course they can,

37:44.027 --> 37:46.094
for the song has many parts.

37:46.096 --> 37:48.929
And though they may
sound different at first,

37:48.931 --> 37:51.465
if you listen with your heart,

37:51.467 --> 37:54.668
you will know
they are the same.

37:54.670 --> 37:56.538
Different and the same?

37:56.540 --> 38:00.007
Precisely! You've got it!

38:00.009 --> 38:02.576
Uh, not exactly.

38:02.578 --> 38:05.779
Don't worry, Leif.
You will get it in time.

38:05.781 --> 38:08.715
The words in the song
are alive, you see.

38:08.717 --> 38:10.585
They are living words.

38:10.587 --> 38:13.487
Have a little faith,
and you will see.

38:13.489 --> 38:15.088
I don't know, Nicholai.

38:15.090 --> 38:18.659
I want to believe,
but I still have my doubts.

38:18.661 --> 38:20.061
That's excellent!

38:20.063 --> 38:23.697
A man without a doubt
never had a thought.

38:23.699 --> 38:26.701
Faith always begins
with questions.

38:26.703 --> 38:30.407
You're closer to believing
than you think.

38:36.645 --> 38:38.848
Thanks again
for your help, Melody.

38:40.183 --> 38:41.851
Sure, Mrs. Potterson.

38:43.819 --> 38:45.619
Now, who could've imagined

38:45.621 --> 38:48.155
a snowstorm
in the middle of summer?

38:48.157 --> 38:50.190
Yeah, it's pretty weird.

38:50.192 --> 38:53.828
Well, I should be going.
Nicholai will be looking for me.

38:53.830 --> 38:56.663
Oh, and speaking about
your grandfather,

38:56.665 --> 38:58.166
everyone got
a little carried away

38:58.168 --> 39:01.069
in the village the other day.

39:01.071 --> 39:03.770
I've been feeling
just terrible about it.

39:03.772 --> 39:05.639
It's okay, Mrs. Potterson.

39:05.641 --> 39:07.608
I'll tell him you said hi.

39:07.610 --> 39:09.710
Yes, please do, won't you?

39:09.712 --> 39:10.978
Bye.

39:10.980 --> 39:14.983
My, my, what a sweet girl.

39:14.985 --> 39:17.284
So, tell me, old wall,

39:17.286 --> 39:20.857
what secrets
do you have for me today?

39:23.092 --> 39:27.929
Brick by brick, you're telling
me a story, aren't you?

39:27.931 --> 39:31.599
Dracon, banished to the depths
of a mountain cave,

39:31.601 --> 39:36.103
and the people singing the song
with thankful hearts.

39:36.105 --> 39:40.074
Yes, I see, but there's more,
isn't there?

39:40.076 --> 39:43.545
Come on, now.
Don't be shy.

39:43.547 --> 39:47.181
You know, if the villagers
could hear me now,

39:47.183 --> 39:49.650
having this conversation
with you,

39:49.652 --> 39:52.085
they'd probably put me away.

39:52.087 --> 39:54.655
So show me what is hidden.

39:54.657 --> 39:56.824
Speak to me, won't you?

39:56.826 --> 39:59.192
What? Wait a minute.

39:59.194 --> 40:01.628
What have we here?

40:01.630 --> 40:03.297
This is new.

40:03.299 --> 40:05.768
If I could just...

40:08.572 --> 40:11.108
Now I've done it.

40:17.581 --> 40:19.179
No, it can't be.

40:19.181 --> 40:21.616
The blue daisies dying,

40:21.618 --> 40:24.851
a storm cloud rising
from the mountain,

40:24.853 --> 40:26.753
and the ice dragon unleashed?

40:26.755 --> 40:28.121
I knew it!

40:28.123 --> 40:30.190
The dragon is the storm.

40:30.192 --> 40:33.596
I must warn the village
at once.

40:46.342 --> 40:47.675
Drink up, boys.

40:47.677 --> 40:48.675
Cheers!

40:48.677 --> 40:49.876
Listen up!

40:49.878 --> 40:51.779
Nicholai!
Join us, friend.

40:51.781 --> 40:56.116
No time for that.
I'm here to warn you.

40:56.118 --> 40:58.853
I've made a discovery
in Sanctuary.

40:58.855 --> 41:01.956
This storm,
it's just the beginning.

41:01.958 --> 41:04.659
Beginning of what,
endless winter?

41:04.661 --> 41:07.628
The return of the ice dragon?

41:07.630 --> 41:10.931
The people have moved on
from those old fables, Nicholai,

41:10.933 --> 41:12.166
and so should you.

41:12.168 --> 41:15.003
Go on outside
and enjoy the snow day.

41:15.005 --> 41:16.607
Have a little fun.

41:20.176 --> 41:23.246
It's not a fable,
and I'm going to prove it.

41:24.813 --> 41:27.114
Please, let us in!

41:27.116 --> 41:28.715
Help us!

41:28.717 --> 41:30.384
We need shelter.

41:30.386 --> 41:33.723
Come in. You're welcome here
where it's warm.

41:36.793 --> 41:38.326
Nicholai, what should we do?

41:38.328 --> 41:41.429
Our home is covered in ice,
and we're freezing.

41:41.431 --> 41:45.202
Go to Sanctuary.
You'll be safe and warm there.

41:53.777 --> 41:55.311
Mommy, I'm scared.

41:56.779 --> 41:58.045
No!

41:58.047 --> 41:59.846
Mommy!

41:59.848 --> 42:01.882
It's okay.
Mommy's all right.

42:01.884 --> 42:04.886
Come on, Hunter,
they need our help.

42:06.089 --> 42:07.989
Are you okay?

42:07.991 --> 42:09.257
I'm all right.

42:09.259 --> 42:11.826
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.

42:11.828 --> 42:14.094
We're trying to get
to Sanctuary.

42:14.096 --> 42:16.130
Nicholai said
it would be safe there.

42:16.132 --> 42:17.732
He's right.

42:17.734 --> 42:18.965
- Now, hold onto Hunter.
- I will.

42:18.967 --> 42:21.369
It'll be okay. Let's go.

42:21.371 --> 42:23.337
Before we all freeze to death!

42:23.339 --> 42:26.043
Just a little further.
Almost there.

42:32.081 --> 42:34.348
Ah...

42:34.350 --> 42:36.150
Thank you, Leif.

42:36.152 --> 42:40.657
Sure. Get warmed up and let me
know if you need anything.

42:43.493 --> 42:46.126
The storm is getting nasty
out there.

42:46.128 --> 42:50.230
I know. People are running out
of firewood and food, Leif.

42:50.232 --> 42:52.833
I don't know what to do.
Have you seen Nicholai?

42:52.835 --> 42:54.735
No, I haven't.

42:54.737 --> 42:58.473
I saw him leave for the
mountains, the crazy old fool.

42:58.475 --> 42:59.773
What?

42:59.775 --> 43:01.909
Oh, no.

43:01.911 --> 43:04.378
Melody, I'm scared
of the storm.

43:05.781 --> 43:07.114
What was that?

43:07.116 --> 43:08.750
It's only the wind.

43:08.752 --> 43:10.050
I'm sorry.

43:10.052 --> 43:12.987
She's just frightened.
We all are.

43:12.989 --> 43:14.922
That's okay.

43:14.924 --> 43:17.125
Sometimes I get afraid, too,
you know.

43:17.127 --> 43:19.360
But when that happens,
do you know what I do?

43:19.362 --> 43:20.393
What?

Ah.

46:41.563 --> 46:43.634
Oh.

47:27.210 --> 47:30.210
I know who you are, dragon!

47:30.212 --> 47:34.248
I'm here to tell you the song's
alive and well, you know.

47:34.250 --> 47:37.052
So you best stay down
in your...

49:07.375 --> 49:09.812
What? No, no, no!

49:12.781 --> 49:14.116
What's happening?

49:19.554 --> 49:21.188
What are those things?

49:21.190 --> 49:24.094
I'm not sticking around
to find out. Come on!

49:25.293 --> 49:27.895
Hey, guys,
why is everyone running?

49:27.897 --> 49:29.295
Some kind of wolves.

49:33.603 --> 49:37.637
Keep running.
I'll make mincemeat out of 'em.

49:37.639 --> 49:39.676
That's right, come on.

49:44.913 --> 49:46.746
Open the door!

49:46.748 --> 49:49.218
Let us in! Let us in!

49:52.587 --> 49:54.889
- Did you see that?
- What are those things?

49:54.891 --> 49:57.427
- Monsters!
- Hurry, get inside!

49:59.494 --> 50:01.829
Hunter, no, stay!

50:01.831 --> 50:03.831
Why aren't they attacking?

50:03.833 --> 50:07.634
It's like they're
waiting for something.

50:07.636 --> 50:09.603
Look at that cloud.

50:09.605 --> 50:11.704
It's weird,
like something's inside it.

50:11.706 --> 50:14.643
I have a bad feeling
about this.

50:15.710 --> 50:17.210
Leif!

50:17.212 --> 50:19.148
Get inside! Now!

50:25.621 --> 50:27.621
We've gotta shut these doors.

50:27.623 --> 50:29.493
They're stuck,
frozen to the ground!

50:37.799 --> 50:39.532
No, it can't be true.

50:39.534 --> 50:40.668
Oh, no.

50:40.670 --> 50:42.603
What are you doing?

50:42.605 --> 50:43.673
I'm saving you.

50:56.786 --> 50:59.755
Get inside!

51:00.989 --> 51:02.192
Leif!

51:03.525 --> 51:05.361
It's the ice dragon!

51:07.563 --> 51:09.900
- The what?
- It's coming this way!

51:32.487 --> 51:34.387
- Ice dragon!
- Leif?

51:34.389 --> 51:35.723
Hey, dragon!

51:35.725 --> 51:37.590
I've seen your picture.

51:37.592 --> 51:39.692
You're much uglier in person.

51:42.598 --> 51:46.300
Maybe you're beautiful
on the inside.

51:46.302 --> 51:47.904
Then again, maybe not.

51:54.909 --> 51:58.478
We have to break this ice!
The door is frozen shut!

51:58.480 --> 52:00.514
Hunter, calm down.

52:00.516 --> 52:03.416
We'll get out to help Leif
as soon as they break the ice.

52:26.574 --> 52:27.777
Here goes.

52:28.944 --> 52:30.447
Whoa, whoa! Ohh!

53:38.647 --> 53:40.449
Ah, come on!

54:03.772 --> 54:06.072
Okay, take it easy.

54:06.074 --> 54:09.576
Nice werewolf,
doggy creature thingies.

54:09.578 --> 54:12.045
Back! Back!

54:12.047 --> 54:15.114
Oh, you're scared of the sword,
aren't you?

54:20.156 --> 54:22.025
Get out of here!

54:24.025 --> 54:27.129
That wasn't so bad.

54:33.868 --> 54:34.867
Huh?

54:37.605 --> 54:39.907
Hunter, what'd you find, boy?

54:41.677 --> 54:43.913
Found a way out.

54:58.027 --> 55:00.130
Why, I...

55:04.065 --> 55:06.099
Come on.

55:11.639 --> 55:14.174
Hey, what are you doing here?

55:14.176 --> 55:16.643
No, no, shh, shh, quiet.

55:16.645 --> 55:18.512
There's a dragon.

55:18.514 --> 55:19.746
Whew.

55:21.217 --> 55:22.452
Uh...

55:47.775 --> 55:50.576
Hunter, what are you doing?

55:50.578 --> 55:51.947
Get out of there!

55:56.185 --> 55:58.554
No! Hunter!

55:59.755 --> 56:01.023
Grrr!

56:26.549 --> 56:31.050
So you don't believe
in dragons?

56:31.052 --> 56:33.152
No, no, I'm coming around.

56:35.690 --> 56:37.257
Okay, okay!

56:37.259 --> 56:39.659
Foolish boy.

56:39.661 --> 56:44.565
Your kind has given me the power
to rule this world!

56:44.567 --> 56:45.799
What do you mean?

56:45.801 --> 56:48.569
With the old man dead,

56:48.571 --> 56:51.938
my powers will soon be
unstoppable!

56:51.940 --> 56:54.340
Nicholai is dead?

56:54.342 --> 56:57.744
Yes, and with him
the cursed song as well.

56:57.746 --> 56:59.346
No, he can't be!

Do you, Leif?
Do you really?

01:03:56.998 --> 01:04:00.535

Yeah, I really do.

lives in our hearts.

01:04:27.061 --> 01:04:31.230

01:04:31.232 --> 01:04:32.799
What about the other villages?

01:04:32.801 --> 01:04:35.067
Many there
have forgotten the song.

01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:36.136

01:04:36.138 --> 01:04:37.570

Yes, the sword of the spirit
is powerful,

01:04:40.375 --> 01:04:43.643
but we will need the Giver's
full armor to face evil,

01:04:43.645 --> 01:04:45.712
if it ever returns.

01:04:45.714 --> 01:04:48.648

hearts can turn cold,

01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:50.516
