00:02.333 --> 00:06.208
Kurukshetra,
situated in the heart of India...

00:06.875 --> 00:08.958
clustered by Haryana and...

00:09.375 --> 00:14.750
surrounded by the Saraswati river
is this historical place.

00:15.208 --> 00:19.292
The Kaurava's and the Pandava's
fought an epic battle at this very place.

00:19.375 --> 00:20.750
GITA PREACHING SPOT

00:21.417 --> 00:24.750
Centuries have passed,
ideologies have changed,

00:25.167 --> 00:28.667
but the battle is still being fought here.

00:30.042 --> 00:31.875
These days, there's one warrior
in Kurukshetra

00:31.958 --> 00:35.417
who fights to protect the honor of truth.

00:41.667 --> 00:45.042
We also know him as Big Boss.

00:46.833 --> 00:49.750
Although he's called the transport king...

00:50.417 --> 00:53.208
of this area, but the Big Boss' real job

00:53.458 --> 00:58.417
is to abduct, stumble,
and deliver bad guys.

01:06.167 --> 01:10.250
Big Boss conjures blessings
as well as enemies.

01:11.083 --> 01:16.375
Today he's off to Mirzapur
in regard of a new contract.

01:17.917 --> 01:20.792
But Big Boss doesn't know that...

01:21.292 --> 01:27.167
life has already put
a price on his head.

01:29.167 --> 01:31.375
Move the car. Why did you park it here?

01:33.708 --> 01:36.458
Did you have to take the station road?

01:36.625 --> 01:39.042
What to do, Big Boss?
The highway's closed.

01:39.125 --> 01:41.708
This is the only alternate route
to Mirzapur.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.500
Big Boss, can I go pee?
Or else I'll wet my pants.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Go on.

01:48.958 --> 01:52.875
-Hurry up, or you'll pee in your pants.
-Big Boss, for you.

01:56.292 --> 01:59.458
It's really hot.
Give one to my men as well.

01:59.542 --> 02:00.458
Yes, boss.

02:06.792 --> 02:08.333
-Listen.
-Yes.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.583
-See that boy sitting there?
-Yes, Big Boss.

02:10.667 --> 02:12.708
-Give one to him too.
-Yes.

02:13.708 --> 02:16.667
-I don't have money.
-I didn't ask for it.

02:17.458 --> 02:21.250
I'm as old as your father.
Take it as my blessings.

02:21.417 --> 02:23.667
Here. Take it, son.

02:36.292 --> 02:39.125
Hey, boy. Won't you thank the Big Boss?

02:45.292 --> 02:47.708
Offering water to the thirsty
is a good deed.

02:49.083 --> 02:51.208
And you've earned a merit
because of me.

02:53.042 --> 02:56.083
So, should I be thanking him
or will he thank me?

03:05.875 --> 03:09.208
I must admit. He's no ordinary boy.

03:10.125 --> 03:12.542
Because he talks about common sense.

03:49.167 --> 03:51.000
I forgot, Lallan.

03:51.958 --> 03:54.000
Even a bag of rice has pebbles.

03:56.208 --> 03:57.542
And you, Dushyant.

03:58.417 --> 04:02.583
Why don't you set up a cracker-shop?
Maybe you'll do good business?

04:09.042 --> 04:15.125
You made a big mistake taking up enmity
with Dushyant.

04:17.417 --> 04:23.667
No guns.
I'll hack you to pieces with this axeâ€¦

04:24.417 --> 04:29.208
and all of North India won't be able
to put you back together.

05:43.917 --> 05:45.750
Hey, boy, let's go!

05:49.875 --> 05:51.250
Stop, stop!

06:02.375 --> 06:04.125
Why did you save me?

06:05.708 --> 06:07.083
You're like my father.

06:09.083 --> 06:10.667
Such obsession.

06:11.583 --> 06:13.250
You forced me to sit in the car.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.167
Otherwise, I would've shown you more.

06:16.833 --> 06:18.167
Here's some advice...

06:19.458 --> 06:21.542
listen carefully and follow it.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.250
Live larger than life.

06:26.042 --> 06:28.292
Laugh more than you can cry.

06:29.625 --> 06:33.958
Forgo your anger.
And finish your enemies with a smile.

06:36.583 --> 06:37.625
Get it?

06:38.583 --> 06:40.792
There's a rage in my heart, too.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.542
They killed ten of my men.

06:44.125 --> 06:46.083
I'll kill 20.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.375
But...

06:48.667 --> 06:50.875
look at the boiling point of my mind.

06:51.583 --> 06:52.917
It's still zero!

06:57.667 --> 06:59.583
-Name?
-I want to forget mine.

07:01.792 --> 07:05.917
-Who I am, where I'm from, everything.
-Still, I would like to know.

07:07.042 --> 07:09.875
You can have a little faith
in the Big Boss.

07:10.917 --> 07:12.375
What do you say, Boss?

07:12.708 --> 07:17.125
And this way, Big Boss made that boy
heir to his world and his heart.

07:17.250 --> 07:22.333
And gave that nameless boy a name
that fitted his stature.

07:46.917 --> 07:51.667
"Boy saves
Haryana's transport king's life."

07:53.833 --> 07:55.208
Satyakant.

07:56.167 --> 08:00.250
You're still reading 15-year-old
news about your son.

08:07.583 --> 08:10.333
You know very well, Raghunath.

08:13.250 --> 08:15.875
Surya didn't save any transport king...

08:16.708 --> 08:18.583
he saved a gangster.

08:19.708 --> 08:24.167
And only he can do such a lowly job.

08:25.875 --> 08:26.917
Satyakant.

08:27.750 --> 08:30.458
Time heals all wounds.

08:32.958 --> 08:37.292
Physical wounds may heal with time.

08:39.292 --> 08:43.292
But he's inflicted a wound on my heart.

08:46.375 --> 08:47.500
Satyakant.

08:49.458 --> 08:52.667
He's your son, just like Shiv.

08:54.375 --> 08:57.167
Blood ties don't make up relations,
Raghunath.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.792
You've to abide by it too.

09:02.042 --> 09:06.250
And Shiv has done that. He has.

09:07.375 --> 09:09.625
He's so cultured.

09:10.375 --> 09:13.708
He's always first to lend a helping hand.

09:15.375 --> 09:17.708
He never does anything wrong
behind my back.

09:20.333 --> 09:25.000
And even today he never forgets to give
respect to his elders.

09:27.583 --> 09:31.167
He always leaves a mark behind.

09:31.917 --> 09:33.042
That's true.

09:45.417 --> 09:48.125
Yes. Shiv. Where were you?

09:48.458 --> 09:51.792
Listen. You're going to Delhi tomorrow.
To your uncle.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
-Pack your bags.
-Yes, father.

09:57.625 --> 09:59.958
Come, nephew. Sit.

10:00.875 --> 10:02.708
So are you prepared?

10:03.542 --> 10:04.625
What's happened?

10:05.833 --> 10:09.042
Some seniors were ragging
the new students. So...

10:09.333 --> 10:12.583
Look, son. You should be careful
in such situations.

10:13.208 --> 10:15.208
-Otherwise you will stumble.
-Who stumbled?

10:15.292 --> 10:16.750
No, no one.

10:16.833 --> 10:20.208
I was just saying he should
be careful in life,

10:20.292 --> 10:23.000
-otherwise one stumbles.
-Yes.

10:23.083 --> 10:24.708
That's a good advice. Right.

10:24.792 --> 10:25.833
And, son.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.875
You know whom we're
sending you to in Delhi?

10:28.958 --> 10:31.958
-Your uncle, sub-inspector Zoravar.
-Yes.

10:32.042 --> 10:33.917
He'll take good care of you.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.792
And I've heard he's no ordinary man.

10:37.917 --> 10:40.583
The whole of Delhi's afraid of him.

10:40.917 --> 10:42.375
I've heard that people fear him,

10:42.458 --> 10:46.042
more than Chulbul Pandey
and Singham.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.417
Zoravar's so feared,

10:48.500 --> 10:53.750
he always catches the goons he's after.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.167
Help! Police, help!

11:10.250 --> 11:11.125
Police!

11:12.583 --> 11:13.625
Help!

11:16.750 --> 11:18.958
Don't beat me. Don't beat me.

11:20.208 --> 11:21.583
Beat him.

11:23.458 --> 11:24.333
Uncle.

11:24.458 --> 11:29.208
I never imagined I'd come to Delhi
and see you in this condition.

11:29.583 --> 11:32.708
-How did this happen?
-Nephew.

11:34.125 --> 11:37.583
There were 20 of them and I was alone.

11:38.292 --> 11:41.417
But I beat them black and blue.

11:41.917 --> 11:44.458
My name's inspector Zoravar Singh!

11:44.750 --> 11:47.333
I can make a rose stink.

11:47.500 --> 11:51.708
Give a swine swine-flu.
And give headlice to a baldie.

11:51.792 --> 11:54.667
Listen! You can't even lie properly.

11:55.042 --> 11:57.458
Shiv, the truth is...

11:58.042 --> 12:00.833
He's no brave officer.

12:00.958 --> 12:03.292
He's a coward cop.

12:03.375 --> 12:04.875
What?

12:07.750 --> 12:10.792
He's been beaten up by the local thugs.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.292
You're not worthy of being my husband.

12:14.375 --> 12:16.750
I say, you're not worthy
of this uniform either.

12:18.875 --> 12:21.167
What did she hurl at me? Witch.

12:22.917 --> 12:24.250
Nephew.

12:25.208 --> 12:26.542
It's like this.

12:26.875 --> 12:28.708
I'm actually a sub-inspector.

12:29.250 --> 12:32.333
I couldn't become an inspector.

12:33.042 --> 12:34.167
You see.

12:34.458 --> 12:38.125
I had been appointed for the security

12:38.375 --> 12:41.375
of that crazy ACP
Ayushman Thakur's sister.

12:41.625 --> 12:44.083
Now how do I go with this broken hand?

12:44.167 --> 12:45.792
You don't get it. See.

12:46.375 --> 12:49.167
-What are you doing?
-Take a look.

12:50.250 --> 12:55.125
This uniform transforms
a common man into a hero.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.208
I see.

12:56.292 --> 13:01.625
This uniform can turn an out-of-form guy
into a macho-man.

13:02.417 --> 13:03.292
What?

13:06.500 --> 13:08.667
Only you can save me
from suspension now.

13:08.750 --> 13:11.042
-What?
-You take my place.

13:11.917 --> 13:14.417
Go posing as inspector Zoravar.

13:14.583 --> 13:18.125
-Zoravar can--
-Hold on, Uncle.

13:18.208 --> 13:23.792
-This is impossible, I cannot do it.
-Why do you think the ACP chose me?

13:23.875 --> 13:26.292
Because he knows it's just a formality.

13:26.375 --> 13:29.833
And I assure you she will believe
you're Zoravar.

13:30.042 --> 13:33.083
Because she has never seen me.
It's her first time to Delhi.

13:33.167 --> 13:35.458
It's just for three days.
Here's her photograph.

13:35.542 --> 13:36.792
What's the problem?

13:38.917 --> 13:40.250
Yes, she's...

13:40.792 --> 13:43.917
-You know her?
-Yes, I know her very well.

13:44.792 --> 13:47.583
We met last year during
the Jaipur inter-college festival.

13:50.083 --> 13:51.333
Her voice.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.417
Her eyes.

13:57.833 --> 14:02.458
That mind-blowing attitude.
Different. Unique.

14:17.417 --> 14:20.708
This is one view that's been
shown over a thousand times.

14:27.042 --> 14:30.750
But each time the effect is amazing.

14:48.083 --> 14:50.292
-You joined the police force?
-Yes.

14:50.500 --> 14:53.250
And now I'm here to join you,
for your security.

14:54.542 --> 14:57.125
But when did you become Zoravar?

15:00.250 --> 15:03.333
-I'll tell you. Let's go.
-Okay. I get it.

15:11.292 --> 15:13.375
You two go on, I'll park my bike.

15:20.833 --> 15:23.833
Vishal, I've already fixed
my program with my friend.

15:24.750 --> 15:27.250
Even our wedding's been fixed, Ankita.

15:27.625 --> 15:29.750
My dad and your brother fixed it.

15:30.250 --> 15:31.250
And pop...

15:33.542 --> 15:35.333
And you know who my pop is?

15:37.708 --> 15:42.958
And do you know
why you're given police protection?

15:43.375 --> 15:44.625
Because I said so. Me.

15:50.875 --> 15:53.125
Excuse me, Vishal.
But our film's just begun.

15:56.458 --> 15:58.125
If the film's begun,

15:58.250 --> 16:01.167
then the hero has got to hold
the heroine's hand.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.250
Oh, so sweet. Or else?

16:48.542 --> 16:50.375
Move. Move. Move!

16:52.458 --> 16:53.458
I hit him.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.292
Watch out!

17:08.458 --> 17:09.875
Shiv, are you okay?

17:11.083 --> 17:14.708
Ankita, this is a big problem.

17:15.458 --> 17:18.125
The real problem will start
when my brother finds out.

17:30.792 --> 17:31.667
Come on.

17:35.958 --> 17:37.167
Come on, keep walking.

17:42.167 --> 17:44.000
Why bring us here, sir?

17:46.375 --> 17:49.042
I tried explaining nicely,
but you wouldn't listen.

17:50.667 --> 17:53.375
If you go against Minister Pradhan

17:53.458 --> 17:57.125
and roam around like a big oaf,
you'll be put down like a dog.

17:59.625 --> 18:01.333
There's just one way to save yourselves.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.083
Kill me and escape.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.625
Don't try to run from death.

19:17.958 --> 19:20.208
People have a wrong notion about death.

19:21.792 --> 19:23.583
Its life that makes you suffer.

19:58.958 --> 20:02.500
Garbage cleared. My record's also cleared.

20:08.292 --> 20:11.458
-Mr. Pradhan, your job's done.
-Great.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.833
Ayushman.

20:18.250 --> 20:21.042
Sometimes I can't decide...

20:21.667 --> 20:25.417
who the bigger rascal is.

20:25.750 --> 20:27.292
Doesn't make a difference.

20:27.833 --> 20:29.875
We're both serving the country.

20:30.750 --> 20:33.792
If you're eager on taking a decision
then decide when I'm going to be CP.

20:33.875 --> 20:39.875
I'll sign on your promotion letter
only when your sister and my son...

20:40.500 --> 20:43.500
sign on the marriage certificate.

20:43.833 --> 20:49.875
Even I can't decide, Mr. Pradhan,
who the bigger rascal is.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.792
What to do, Ayushman?

20:52.875 --> 20:56.083
My son's heart is set on your sister.

20:57.042 --> 21:01.333
And my son's wish is my command.

21:04.583 --> 21:09.750
On that note,
let's celebrate at your house today. Okay?

21:10.542 --> 21:12.208
-Sir.
-What is it?

21:12.500 --> 21:16.583
The police thrashed Vishal.
They threw him down from the multiplex.

21:16.750 --> 21:17.625
What?

21:17.833 --> 21:19.250
What happened, Mr. Pradhan?

21:19.333 --> 21:24.458
That police officer, whom you appointed
for Ankita's security thrashed Vishal.

21:25.167 --> 21:28.458
Threw him down from the first floor
of Galaxy Multiplex.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.792
-Zoravar.
-Whoever he is.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.708
That midget beat-up Vishal.

21:33.708 --> 21:34.708
I'll look into it.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.292
Get the car!

21:37.875 --> 21:40.500
Jadhav, whatever.

21:41.458 --> 21:44.625
Get me Galaxy Multiplex
CCTV footages now.

21:49.833 --> 21:51.458
It can't be Zoravar.

21:52.750 --> 21:53.792
It's someone else.

21:58.833 --> 22:02.792
No one's took a stand for me, ever.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.833
You gave him a fitting reply,
only for me.

22:10.917 --> 22:13.458
Ankita, some decisions
are taken instantly.

22:18.542 --> 22:20.625
And those decisions come from the heart.

25:13.042 --> 25:13.917
Brother.

25:16.958 --> 25:17.833
Brother, I...

26:01.750 --> 26:05.500
Sir, it's entirely my fault.
I gave him my uniform.

26:05.625 --> 26:07.542
He's new in Delhi.

26:07.708 --> 26:09.750
-Jadhav.
-Yadav, sir.

26:09.833 --> 26:10.792
Whatever.

26:11.208 --> 26:14.750
Type his suspension letter.
And file charges on Shiv.

26:15.125 --> 26:17.833
One: Damaging public property.

26:18.083 --> 26:20.625
Two: Assaulting the Home Minister's son.

26:20.917 --> 26:23.375
Three: Donning a police uniform.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.292
Four: Slapping an on-duty officer.

26:27.500 --> 26:28.958
He never slapped me, sir.

26:30.875 --> 26:32.917
He did now. Write it down.

26:34.375 --> 26:38.000
Sir, what are you doing, ACP sir?

26:38.833 --> 26:42.000
You're abusing your power and position.

26:45.333 --> 26:48.083
-Who is he?
-I am...

26:48.875 --> 26:51.917
Look, he's Shiv's father.

26:52.958 --> 26:55.292
-I called them.
-Uncle.

26:56.750 --> 26:57.917
Hello, Uncle.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.667
-You should've told me earlier.
-I...

26:59.750 --> 27:03.333
Uncle, why did you take the trouble?
You should've called me.

27:03.458 --> 27:04.708
What would you like to have?

27:05.958 --> 27:08.917
Get some water for Uncle.
Take a seat, don't stand. Sit. Sit.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.125
Ayushman!

27:15.208 --> 27:16.833
What the...

27:22.167 --> 27:24.042
Hit here but the pain's there.

27:25.708 --> 27:26.875
Stop it!

27:28.083 --> 27:29.208
Ayushman!

27:29.292 --> 27:30.667
ACP sir, what are you doing?

27:31.208 --> 27:32.208
Get lost.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.167
Listen, old man.

27:35.250 --> 27:36.375
Ayushman!

27:37.625 --> 27:41.208
I'm going to screw your son over
every day in my jail.

27:42.958 --> 27:45.083
Day and night.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.750
I'll make him suffer slowly.

27:49.917 --> 27:53.500
I'll pressure him to death.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.125
Every time he breathes I'll file
new charges against him.

28:00.292 --> 28:04.958
I'll make his life hell,
but I won't kill him.

28:05.917 --> 28:11.125
Because people are mistaken about death.

28:12.417 --> 28:16.333
When actually life makes you suffer.

28:16.917 --> 28:17.875
Get lost!

28:18.583 --> 28:20.000
Bloody cripple.

28:41.542 --> 28:42.583
Satyakant.

28:43.708 --> 28:49.125
The law, rules, the people here,
follow only Ayushman Thakur.

28:50.792 --> 28:55.875
But we've to get Shiv
justice under any condition.

28:58.250 --> 29:03.792
We'll need to deal with Ayushman Thakur.
We'll need someone as tough as him.

29:04.500 --> 29:08.875
And we know which tough guy I mean.

29:11.125 --> 29:13.167
You're right, Raghunath.

29:14.167 --> 29:19.167
No matter how polluted the water is,
it always douses fire.

29:21.042 --> 29:22.625
Ayushman Thakur.

29:24.500 --> 29:28.792
Only a bada can deal
with the likes of you.

29:35.708 --> 29:39.292
I will call him and he'll come.

29:43.083 --> 29:47.667
Life won't trouble you anymore, he will!

29:54.458 --> 29:59.375
That mountain is coming to lock horns
with you at every moment.

30:04.583 --> 30:08.500
That mountain is coming
to fight for my son.

31:07.250 --> 31:13.000
You're here to settle the score.

31:13.792 --> 31:17.667
Then come face me in the middle.
What are you doing on the right?

31:17.750 --> 31:21.833
You fool. Haven't you heard?

31:26.708 --> 31:32.750
Then you can stand on the right and talk.
Because this chair is occupied.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.542
I'm the Boss after all.

31:43.833 --> 31:47.958
I always carry my rocking chair along.
See.

31:48.042 --> 31:49.917
You call this a chair?

31:57.125 --> 32:00.250
What do I care?
I just want to get the water.

32:03.833 --> 32:06.917
Bajrang, I've just one business.

32:08.542 --> 32:10.042
-What business?
-Transport.

32:10.125 --> 32:11.500
Don't interfere!

32:12.667 --> 32:16.750
Bajrang, all these trucks
are from my uncle.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.583
-Except for one.
-Except for one?

32:20.417 --> 32:25.792
Once I saved my sister's honor.
She gifted me this vehicle as a token.

32:25.917 --> 32:29.333
And what did I do? I named it
"Bahen Ki Lorry."

32:29.458 --> 32:30.583
SISTER'S TRUCK

32:30.667 --> 32:31.917
-What did I name it?
-"Bahen Ki Lorry"!

32:32.042 --> 32:33.583
Don't interfere!

32:35.792 --> 32:37.000
Twenty trucks!

32:37.083 --> 32:41.625
Because I'll buy all
the stuff at the right price.

32:42.083 --> 32:47.042
Because everyone knows I'm not a cheat,
but everyone knows you are.

32:47.125 --> 32:49.667
What do they know? Say it.

32:50.625 --> 32:54.750
-Say it. I've to conclude my dialogue.
-No.

32:55.042 --> 32:55.917
Say it.

32:56.083 --> 32:58.208
-Cheating.
-Don't interfere!

32:58.375 --> 32:59.292
Beat him!

33:03.000 --> 33:06.958
Play the music so I can whack their drums.

34:41.958 --> 34:43.042
What happened?

34:49.708 --> 34:52.083
-He hit the Boss?
-What now?

34:55.375 --> 34:56.667
Start the music.

34:58.208 --> 35:00.792
What are you doing? I'm not getting
in the mood. Come on.

37:06.292 --> 37:09.375
Save me! Save me!

37:10.208 --> 37:11.208
Save me!

37:12.333 --> 37:15.083
Help! Help! Save me!

37:19.542 --> 37:22.583
What do I care? I just want
to get the water.

37:25.292 --> 37:27.250
Boss, thank you.

37:27.875 --> 37:30.167
You're truly our benefactor.

37:30.333 --> 37:33.208
That's not true, Uncle.
The real benefactor's the one up there.

37:33.292 --> 37:37.542
Boss, Tauji wants to meet you tomorrow.

37:39.292 --> 37:41.167
Regarding a new contract.

37:43.417 --> 37:45.500
Trilok, your name's really apt.

37:46.167 --> 37:48.750
Three diseases locked in your body.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.417
I can't drink a glass of water
in a single breath,

37:52.500 --> 37:55.500
and you hiccup, sneeze and cough.

37:55.583 --> 37:58.250
-Get yourself treated.
-I've changed my doctor.

37:58.458 --> 38:02.125
But, Boss.
Trilok's contract is for tomorrow.

38:02.292 --> 38:03.833
And tomorrow's Saturday.

38:06.250 --> 38:12.625
Saturday means no work.
Only singing and dancing.

38:56.250 --> 38:58.375
There's clamour all around

38:58.631 --> 39:00.875
When the boss roars

39:01.006 --> 39:03.417
Once he gets enraged

39:03.542 --> 39:06.292
He rips the earth apart

39:07.875 --> 39:10.125
Attitude like a minister

39:10.208 --> 39:12.417
Everyone takes my favour

39:12.625 --> 39:14.750
I've a high approach

39:14.833 --> 39:16.833
I'm the Boss

39:17.667 --> 39:19.917
I'm still rustic

39:20.042 --> 39:22.208
All the trucks have AC

39:22.500 --> 39:24.542
The music's always high

39:24.750 --> 39:26.875
I'm the Boss

39:28.208 --> 39:32.833
The ace of spades Boss
He's one in a million Boss

39:33.000 --> 39:34.875
It's written everywhere Boss

39:37.875 --> 39:42.708
The king of six-packs Boss
Wears only branded clothes Boss

39:42.792 --> 39:44.792
Only attitude makes you Boss

39:58.750 --> 40:03.833
I never praise myself
I'm only scared of the Lord

40:03.958 --> 40:06.167
If anyone tries to be my boss

40:06.250 --> 40:08.458
I beat him to a pulp
and show him his place

40:08.542 --> 40:13.542
The only king of Haryana
I've a huge fan-following

40:13.750 --> 40:18.542
But it doesn't make a difference to me
He's the only benefactor for all of us

40:18.625 --> 40:23.292
I'm a little naughty at heart
But I never make a fool of me

40:23.417 --> 40:25.583
I like you today

40:28.458 --> 40:33.292
Let's take you on a ride
Buy you Gucci and Louis

40:33.375 --> 40:35.750
Akshay Kumar's my brother

40:35.833 --> 40:38.042
Just say it and I'll get
your picture taken with him

40:39.042 --> 40:43.792
The ace of spades Boss
He's one in a million Boss

40:43.875 --> 40:45.875
It's written everywhere Boss

40:48.792 --> 40:53.625
The king of six-packs Boss
Wears only branded clothes Boss

40:53.708 --> 40:55.875
Only attitude makes you Boss

41:13.875 --> 41:17.125
One of our viewers has sent us
this picture via MMS.

41:17.208 --> 41:19.042
Look at the ugly facet of the police...

41:19.625 --> 41:21.958
You here?
Are you here with the token?

41:22.583 --> 41:23.458
Token?

41:24.375 --> 41:26.792
I'm here to show you your qualities.
Take a look.

41:26.958 --> 41:30.667
Take a look how ACP Ayushman Thakur
is openly assaulting an injured man

41:30.750 --> 41:32.625
in a quiet housing-society.

41:32.958 --> 41:35.625
The people demand an
answer from the police.

41:35.708 --> 41:39.542
Because if the protector turns cruel,
then whom will the people go to?

41:39.750 --> 41:41.917
The police are often accused--

41:44.958 --> 41:47.208
Mr. Pradhan, those with a name...

41:49.208 --> 41:50.667
often get defamed.

41:51.542 --> 41:53.125
But I'm a minister.

41:54.083 --> 41:57.125
If I get defamed my party
will be finished.

42:00.833 --> 42:02.292
Vishwas fired a shot.

42:02.792 --> 42:05.792
If Shiv is questioned then me and my
son will be in trouble.

42:06.083 --> 42:08.500
The election's around the corner.
The media cannot be trusted.

42:08.583 --> 42:10.125
Why don't you understand this?

42:14.333 --> 42:16.833
Let's take care of Shiv permanently.

42:18.208 --> 42:20.917
Let's burn him and bury his body.

42:28.208 --> 42:34.833
I want to be on the top, touching the sky,
and you're still busy burying people.

42:35.125 --> 42:38.208
I want to be a hit in politics,
not be on someone's hit-list.

42:38.292 --> 42:39.792
-Mr. Pradhan--
-Enough.

42:41.083 --> 42:43.708
You won't move a muscle.

42:44.708 --> 42:46.542
I'll take care of things now.

42:47.833 --> 42:52.083
If anyone asks, say that Shiv's
still being investigated.

42:52.458 --> 42:56.417
The dog will definitely die.

42:56.500 --> 43:00.125
But someone else will kill him.

43:00.625 --> 43:01.625
Get it?

43:11.667 --> 43:14.000
Let's burn him and bury his body.

43:17.833 --> 43:19.083
Someone else.

43:27.208 --> 43:29.000
To inquire about Bajrang.

43:30.292 --> 43:32.042
The inspector's here.

43:34.417 --> 43:36.583
Go on. Go to the dispensary.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.250
Otherwise even the rats
at home will fall sick.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.375
Welcome, Inspector.

43:49.833 --> 43:53.500
For the first time, an inspector's
surrounded by goons.

43:56.625 --> 44:00.083
You don't show the finger to the Boss.

44:00.583 --> 44:01.542
Aren't you ashamed?

44:01.625 --> 44:04.875
You thrashed Bajrang's
men in Rajanwadi.

44:05.250 --> 44:09.708
When someone's fit for a beating,
he's bound to get it.

44:09.792 --> 44:13.250
But where's Bajrang?
He's been missing since you thrashed him.

44:13.500 --> 44:17.583
No matter where the rat hides,
you're going to blame me for it.

44:17.667 --> 44:22.583
Boss. You're acting too smart
because Bajrang is still missing.

44:23.125 --> 44:25.000
What will you do if you find him?

44:25.083 --> 44:31.250
I will lock you up for assaulting him.

44:35.292 --> 44:37.583
There's your man.

44:39.708 --> 44:46.250
All the pain you took to deliver him.
Now you beat him up along with me.

44:46.875 --> 44:49.500
Now you'll be arrested too.

44:51.292 --> 44:53.958
But... proof?

45:01.625 --> 45:05.667
Inspector. It's all about perspective.

45:05.917 --> 45:08.375
Two strands of hair in
a glass of milk seems gross,

45:08.458 --> 45:12.292
but on a bald head it seems too little.

45:13.000 --> 45:17.667
From my perspective the Boss
gave justice to the farmers.

45:18.125 --> 45:19.167
Because...

45:20.500 --> 45:22.875
-Say it louder.
-Hail Goddess!

45:29.625 --> 45:32.042
-Boss...
-He sneezed again.

45:32.417 --> 45:34.125
-Pale Anna.
-Welcome. Welcome, Pale Anna.

45:34.208 --> 45:36.583
-Boss.
-Sorry for canceling that meeting.

45:37.875 --> 45:39.375
The contract's for a school teacher.

45:39.458 --> 45:41.583
You have to kill him.
I've brought the money along.

45:45.333 --> 45:49.708
Driver, let's go. Oh, God!

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
-He didn't even have tea--
-Don't interfere!

45:53.958 --> 45:55.458
He made a big mistake.

45:55.958 --> 45:59.333
He could've brought a contract for anyone,
but not a school teacher.

46:07.542 --> 46:08.708
Go ahead.

46:11.042 --> 46:12.333
This way. This way.

46:16.375 --> 46:19.958
Shiv won. Rajan lost.
Shiv won. Rajan lost.

46:33.917 --> 46:36.292
Why play if you're a sore loser, Rajan?

46:46.792 --> 46:47.708
Brother!

47:00.125 --> 47:01.333
-Are you okay, Shiv?
-Yes, brother.

47:01.417 --> 47:04.208
See. He's back to save his brother.

47:04.292 --> 47:08.542
A little longer, and his brother
would've been crippled like his father.

47:19.875 --> 47:23.167
Speak up. What's your answer?

47:24.167 --> 47:25.625
He abused you, father.

47:25.708 --> 47:30.167
Satyakant, better teach your son
before teaching Dharamkunj.

47:30.458 --> 47:32.792
Start teaching about
right and wrong at home.

47:32.917 --> 47:33.792
Look.

47:33.917 --> 47:35.458
Look how cruelly he's been beaten up.

47:35.542 --> 47:37.583
Only a thug or goon
can beat someone like this.

47:37.667 --> 47:39.292
You seem to know a lot about goons.

47:40.792 --> 47:42.667
What do you want to say? Am I a goon?

47:43.250 --> 47:45.958
-Your son's action suggests that.
-Surya!

47:53.875 --> 47:57.792
The first time I hit someone.

47:59.667 --> 48:01.500
And my son, too.

48:05.667 --> 48:08.042
You will never hit anyone again.

48:11.375 --> 48:14.417
I... apologize...

48:17.167 --> 48:18.750
on behalf of my son.

48:24.500 --> 48:25.458
Let's go!

48:28.708 --> 48:29.917
I'll handle him.

48:37.500 --> 48:38.500
Brother.

48:44.500 --> 48:46.125
He abused Dad.

48:47.500 --> 48:50.208
I can endure anything in life...

48:53.083 --> 48:55.292
but if anyone abuses my father...

48:58.917 --> 49:00.375
I won't endure that.

49:06.292 --> 49:08.958
The teacher's reputation was ruined.

49:10.750 --> 49:14.792
What happened today? Why is he so timid?

49:16.125 --> 49:18.875
On one hand, the father
lost his reputation,

49:18.958 --> 49:21.417
and the son, his stubbornness.

49:23.208 --> 49:24.292
Look, Rajan.

49:24.375 --> 49:26.292
I'm not saying anything,
because father asked me not to.

49:26.375 --> 49:28.958
What a family?

49:29.167 --> 49:33.333
The son can't speak
and the father can't walk.

49:43.042 --> 49:44.042
Brother!

49:47.375 --> 49:50.708
Teacher! Surya and Rajan
are fighting again.

50:07.417 --> 50:11.417
-Father. Father. It's not brother's fault.
-Shut up!

50:13.458 --> 50:18.375
Until you two patch this up,
you will stay locked in the same room.

51:09.667 --> 51:12.708
Surya's returning to Dharampur
after three years.

51:13.667 --> 51:15.792
Won't you go bring him home, Satyakant?

51:21.083 --> 51:23.667
He hasn't achieved any act of bravery.

51:25.500 --> 51:27.417
Why should I welcome him?

51:29.625 --> 51:30.958
He's a murderer.

51:33.167 --> 51:35.333
He's returning after serving his sentence.

51:35.625 --> 51:40.208
Exactly, Satyakant. He's served his time.

51:41.417 --> 51:42.708
Look, Satyakant.

51:43.417 --> 51:50.125
Every saint has a past,
and every sinner has a future.

51:51.417 --> 51:54.708
If you don't support him
at this delicate moment,

51:55.583 --> 51:58.000
then you might lose him forever.

51:58.833 --> 52:02.333
Father. Please forgive brother.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.208
Let's go.

52:31.583 --> 52:34.875
Hail Mahadev!

52:42.833 --> 52:43.708
Look...

52:45.417 --> 52:47.333
I've already been
punished for my crimes.

52:49.833 --> 52:51.583
Let's end this enmity.

52:51.750 --> 52:56.208
One needs to kill the enemy.

52:57.125 --> 52:58.542
Understand!

53:38.167 --> 53:40.542
Go on. Kill him!

53:40.833 --> 53:42.333
Catch him!

54:55.333 --> 55:01.208
No matter what color you paint on black,
it will still remain black.

55:05.792 --> 55:08.458
He's already slipped out of our hands.

55:09.583 --> 55:14.417
And now he's out of Satyakant
Shashtri's life too.

55:18.875 --> 55:20.583
Listen carefully.

55:21.625 --> 55:26.208
Satyakant has just one son.
And that's you.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
And you...

55:34.833 --> 55:36.458
get out of here.

55:38.292 --> 55:41.458
There's no place for
a murderer in Dharamkunj.

55:42.667 --> 55:47.125
From today, you're dead to me
and for all of us.

55:48.042 --> 55:49.250
You're dead!

55:53.667 --> 55:54.917
You're dead!

56:00.292 --> 56:01.542
Brother!

56:03.542 --> 56:04.917
Brother!

56:06.583 --> 56:07.833
Brother!

56:41.542 --> 56:42.708
So, Boss...

56:44.208 --> 56:46.667
You should've called me instead, Uncle.

56:46.917 --> 56:51.667
No, no, it's always the needy
that come to the provider.

56:54.542 --> 56:57.375
How can someone like you be sulking?

56:57.458 --> 56:59.875
-What's wrong?
-Nothing, Uncle.

57:00.833 --> 57:05.708
People live their lives, I'm teaching
my life to live, that's all.

57:07.083 --> 57:09.292
Some time ago I gave you advice.

57:09.625 --> 57:13.333
Forgo your anger and finish
your enemy with a smile.

57:13.625 --> 57:15.375
I don't think you learnt.

57:16.500 --> 57:19.125
I did. I learnt.

57:19.833 --> 57:22.458
I also learnt that if you want
to move ahead,

57:22.792 --> 57:27.208
pull down your opponent's pants.
He'll bend over and I'll hop over him.

57:27.333 --> 57:30.500
-And I'll win.
-That's it.

57:30.917 --> 57:36.792
Come on, let's talk work.
There's a contract. Let's sit and talk.

57:37.750 --> 57:38.667
Yes.

57:42.792 --> 57:44.417
Let's talk business.

57:45.292 --> 57:50.333
The job is from Home Minister Pradhan,
and he's an old customer.

57:50.833 --> 57:53.375
And the contract's ACP Thakur.

57:55.458 --> 57:58.333
This boy recently arrived in Delhi.

57:58.958 --> 58:02.000
And he tried to disgrace
Ayushman's sister.

58:02.417 --> 58:06.667
They need outside help
so I had to come to you.

58:06.833 --> 58:10.500
Uncle, is your information right?

58:11.208 --> 58:14.958
-Why? What's wrong?
-The boy looks decent.

58:15.125 --> 58:16.375
I can't believe it.

58:16.583 --> 58:20.500
Sometimes innocent looking people
are the most dangerous ones.

58:21.083 --> 58:24.542
And the Big Boss has
accepted the contract, that's it.

58:25.250 --> 58:26.333
End of discussion.

58:26.417 --> 58:28.292
If the contract's been taken,
the job will be done.

58:28.542 --> 58:30.292
Fine, then I'll leave.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.917
-See you, uncle.
-Bless you.

58:39.583 --> 58:41.542
Boss. An elderly person's
waiting for you outside.

58:41.625 --> 58:46.167
I asked him to come in but he refused.
He's standing outside in the hot sun.

58:46.292 --> 58:51.333
-Ask him what he wants.
-No, he wants to meet only you.

58:52.792 --> 58:53.917
What's his name?

58:58.208 --> 59:00.042
-What happened?
-What did you say?

59:15.333 --> 59:20.250
Your father is your identity

59:21.958 --> 59:27.292
Your father is your life

59:28.583 --> 59:34.542
The only reason you're alive

59:35.333 --> 59:40.500
Is because of the life
your father gave you

59:40.958 --> 59:46.583
Your father is your God

59:47.375 --> 59:53.542
All the gods

59:54.167 --> 1:00:00.083
Dwell in you

1:00:00.458 --> 1:00:06.833
All the gods

1:00:07.375 --> 1:00:13.583
Dwell in you

1:00:14.833 --> 1:00:19.667
All the gods dwell in you

1:00:22.500 --> 1:00:23.625
Father...

1:00:25.625 --> 1:00:26.875
you, here...

1:00:28.542 --> 1:00:29.750
to see me.

1:00:33.958 --> 1:00:37.833
I'm here to meet the Boss.

1:00:41.542 --> 1:00:43.958
I'm here to give a contract to a gangster.

1:00:49.167 --> 1:00:50.083
This is...

1:00:53.458 --> 1:00:55.500
This is the picture of my son.

1:00:58.083 --> 1:01:01.125
His life's in danger. You have to help me.

1:01:03.917 --> 1:01:06.458
I am so unfortunate and helpless.

1:01:07.667 --> 1:01:09.375
I had to see this day.

1:01:10.875 --> 1:01:14.792
I had to request a goon to save my son.

1:01:17.875 --> 1:01:19.792
But I didn't come empty-handed.

1:01:27.417 --> 1:01:29.667
That's not all. This is just the advance.

1:01:30.750 --> 1:01:32.458
Satyakant Acharya Shashtri

1:01:33.250 --> 1:01:39.500
will sell his home, his land, everything.
But he'll pay you your price.

1:01:50.625 --> 1:01:53.542
Father. Please come in.

1:01:55.125 --> 1:02:00.500
I am a simple, decent,
and self-respecting man.

1:02:02.458 --> 1:02:06.625
Visiting a gangster's house is...

1:02:08.125 --> 1:02:09.250
a sin for me.

1:02:10.042 --> 1:02:16.083
What's the value of a father?

1:02:16.750 --> 1:02:22.542
I could never know when I was close

1:02:23.333 --> 1:02:29.250
Love your father

1:02:30.250 --> 1:02:35.125
But could never say

1:02:35.750 --> 1:02:38.833
Your father means everything

1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:40.125
Father...

1:02:42.125 --> 1:02:46.292
you dwell in my heart, my mind, my soul.

1:02:47.833 --> 1:02:51.292
Every inch of my body,
except for one place.

1:02:54.417 --> 1:02:55.625
My destiny.

1:02:55.708 --> 1:03:01.333
All the gods

1:03:02.292 --> 1:03:08.958
Dwell in you

1:03:10.625 --> 1:03:12.833
What's this? Just one bundle.

1:03:15.375 --> 1:03:19.458
That's worth millions for your Boss.

1:03:21.792 --> 1:03:22.667
Boss.

1:03:23.292 --> 1:03:26.292
Ayushman Thakur gave
a contract to kill him.

1:03:26.375 --> 1:03:29.792
And this uncle wants to save him.
Both are same, Boss. Take a look.

1:03:32.917 --> 1:03:34.708
Boss. Who was he?

1:03:35.542 --> 1:03:37.750
He's your Boss's father.

1:03:38.458 --> 1:03:40.708
Father? And he left?

1:03:41.875 --> 1:03:44.375
Small brother. Small brother.

1:03:44.458 --> 1:03:45.625
-He's handsome, right?
-Yes.

1:03:45.708 --> 1:03:47.000
Just like me.

1:03:47.958 --> 1:03:51.250
-Boss, that means--
-That means...

1:03:51.333 --> 1:03:54.917
ACP Ayushman Thakur's...

1:03:55.875 --> 1:03:59.208
the one that's been duping the Big Boss.

1:03:59.958 --> 1:04:02.417
A goon in a police uniform.

1:04:03.292 --> 1:04:04.542
What now, Boss?

1:04:06.083 --> 1:04:08.333
Now, Delhi's not too far.

1:04:08.958 --> 1:04:12.625
Ayushman Thakur, I'm coming...

1:04:13.208 --> 1:04:16.708
to turn your birthplace
into your graveyard.

1:04:17.542 --> 1:04:20.875
Now Boss will fight because...

1:04:23.667 --> 1:04:25.208
No, children.

1:04:32.583 --> 1:04:33.833
Catch me. Catch me.

1:04:34.083 --> 1:04:36.208
Run. Run. The police are here. Run. Run.

1:04:39.625 --> 1:04:41.042
The Boss has received his advance.

1:04:41.875 --> 1:04:44.958
I still say let's bury Shiv and burn him.

1:04:45.042 --> 1:04:46.042
Stop it.

1:04:46.583 --> 1:04:50.750
You see. The first time my father's money
is being put to good use.

1:04:50.958 --> 1:04:52.500
Just get the job done.

1:04:58.542 --> 1:05:01.792
These children don't even
let me drink tea peacefully.

1:05:03.917 --> 1:05:05.625
Verma's son. Listen.

1:05:12.833 --> 1:05:13.917
Cute, isn't he?

1:05:17.125 --> 1:05:18.083
Yuck!

1:05:20.333 --> 1:05:21.625
Take this.

1:05:29.083 --> 1:05:30.167
Listen.

1:05:31.167 --> 1:05:34.250
You see Bittoo? Shoot him here.

1:05:34.708 --> 1:05:35.792
Where will you shoot him?

1:05:35.875 --> 1:05:37.417
-Here.
-Good. Go on, son.

1:05:41.875 --> 1:05:42.958
Rascals.

1:05:43.458 --> 1:05:49.833
-What did you do? Is that empty?
-Yes, It's empty. Just one bullet.

1:05:50.708 --> 1:05:52.250
Hey! Stop.

1:05:55.917 --> 1:05:58.167
What's his name? Verma. Stop. Stop.

1:06:02.167 --> 1:06:05.958
What are you? What if he had fired?

1:06:08.125 --> 1:06:14.458
If he had fired, Bittoo would be dead,
and Verma's son would've been hanged.

1:06:16.667 --> 1:06:20.500
The same thing will apply to
on Boss and Shiv.

1:06:21.458 --> 1:06:23.000
I didn't get it.

1:06:24.333 --> 1:06:27.458
Boss will kill Shiv, and he'll be hanged
for his crime.

1:06:27.542 --> 1:06:29.208
But the Boss works for us?

1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:34.833
I don't trust my father.

1:06:35.875 --> 1:06:37.292
It's an old rule.

1:06:38.333 --> 1:06:41.333
First clear the garbage,
then clear my record.

1:07:03.292 --> 1:07:04.500
Why did you come out?

1:07:07.167 --> 1:07:08.542
From today, your going out...

1:07:10.167 --> 1:07:11.917
and your phone is barred.

1:07:13.667 --> 1:07:16.208
Go lock yourself in the room.

1:07:17.208 --> 1:07:21.125
There are 200 channels on Tata Sky.
Sit at home and watch television.

1:07:22.875 --> 1:07:24.530
I'll call you when it's time
for the engagement

1:07:24.605 --> 1:07:27.917
and nuptial ceremonies.
Don't come out until I don't call you.

1:07:29.292 --> 1:07:30.292
Go.

1:07:31.333 --> 1:07:32.458
Don't stand here.

1:07:33.917 --> 1:07:35.167
Do you want a slap?

1:07:36.042 --> 1:07:36.917
Come on.

1:07:38.667 --> 1:07:40.208
Yes, okay, okay, okay.

1:07:40.750 --> 1:07:42.583
Ayushman. Boss is in Delhi.

1:07:47.750 --> 1:07:48.917
See. Like this.

1:07:50.542 --> 1:07:51.583
Like this. Do you see?

1:07:52.167 --> 1:07:54.458
Where's the Boss?

1:07:57.167 --> 1:07:58.292
He's jogging.

1:07:59.042 --> 1:08:00.292
On the jogging truck.

1:08:01.667 --> 1:08:07.000
Sick man. It's called a jogging track.

1:08:08.042 --> 1:08:12.667
You punk. It's jogging truck.

1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:13.875
Look.

1:09:27.417 --> 1:09:28.292
See.

1:09:34.292 --> 1:09:35.500
What do I care?

1:09:39.208 --> 1:09:41.083
All I want is to get the water.

1:09:47.250 --> 1:09:50.000
Your sweat's so strong.
It made the plants grow.

1:09:50.208 --> 1:09:52.417
That's what you call a "power plant."

1:10:00.792 --> 1:10:02.500
So you're Ayushman Thakur.

1:10:08.917 --> 1:10:11.625
Arrange the meeting in the 5-star lobby.

1:10:13.792 --> 1:10:15.875
What's this?

1:10:16.667 --> 1:10:21.458
I'm the Boss after all.
I always carry my portable lobby along.

1:10:21.625 --> 1:10:22.583
Sit.

1:10:24.042 --> 1:10:27.375
-Where do I sit? Here.
-Don't sit there, you fool.

1:10:27.458 --> 1:10:28.708
It'll crack the eggs.

1:10:28.792 --> 1:10:32.333
-So there are eggs inside?
-No. There are nails.

1:10:32.417 --> 1:10:34.042
They'll pierce through.

1:10:38.625 --> 1:10:43.333
-Yes, Mr. Thakur. How can I be of service?
-Are you going to kill Shiv in jail?

1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:48.833
Why are you being so eager, Thakur?
I know all about you.

1:10:48.958 --> 1:10:52.458
First you clear the garbage,
and then your record.

1:10:52.833 --> 1:10:58.250
Thakur. If I kill him in your jail,
won't there be an investigation on you?

1:10:58.417 --> 1:11:01.333
The media's been showing
your footage with that boy

1:11:01.458 --> 1:11:03.292
and boring you to death.

1:11:03.458 --> 1:11:09.167
-If I kill him won't you be blamed?
-He's right. Then what do we do?

1:11:09.333 --> 1:11:13.292
It's simple.
We won't kill Shiv in jail.

1:11:13.375 --> 1:11:14.958
We'll get him out first and then...

1:11:15.292 --> 1:11:17.417
Superb. Let him escape.

1:11:18.042 --> 1:11:20.542
What do you say, Ayushman?
Let's make him flee from jail.

1:11:20.625 --> 1:11:23.542
Stupid fool. Make him flee?

1:11:23.875 --> 1:11:26.083
Mr. Thakur wants to become the CP.

1:11:26.250 --> 1:11:28.958
Tomorrow if people find out that
one of his inmates has escaped,

1:11:29.042 --> 1:11:32.375
then you can flush his chances
of a promotion down the drain.

1:11:32.458 --> 1:11:33.375
Good.

1:11:33.708 --> 1:11:35.042
What's on your mind?

1:11:35.833 --> 1:11:39.125
Clear all the charges against Shiv
and set him free.

1:11:40.042 --> 1:11:41.625
Once his connection's severed from you,

1:11:41.875 --> 1:11:44.292
I'll cut his connection
with life, permanently.

1:11:45.208 --> 1:11:47.333
What an idea! Great.

1:11:47.625 --> 1:11:52.500
I'm the boss after all.
Free advice along with contract.

1:11:52.875 --> 1:11:56.125
Fine. I'll release Shiv.

1:11:56.833 --> 1:11:57.875
Good.

1:11:58.917 --> 1:12:01.583
-But don't mess up the contract.
-He won't.

1:12:01.958 --> 1:12:02.958
How can he?

1:12:03.375 --> 1:12:08.042
When he kills Shiv, I'll be with him.
Right, Boss?

1:12:24.083 --> 1:12:25.958
Get out. Go on!

1:12:28.083 --> 1:12:28.958
Let's go.

1:14:05.708 --> 1:14:06.583
Who are you?

1:14:08.833 --> 1:14:12.583
Dad, our player's entered the field. Yes.

1:14:14.458 --> 1:14:20.875
-Now I understand why that ACP let me go.
-So that the Boss can kill you?

1:14:21.375 --> 1:14:24.167
So what are you waiting for?
Come on, kill me.

1:14:24.458 --> 1:14:27.167
-Not even your father--
-Don't speak about my father!

1:14:27.500 --> 1:14:29.250
I can endure anything...

1:14:29.750 --> 1:14:34.958
but I can never endure
anyone abusing my father.

1:14:35.875 --> 1:14:40.792
I can endure anything. But if anyone
abuses my father, I cannot endure that.

1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:48.500
-Brother!
-I'm your brother.

1:14:49.542 --> 1:14:52.500
I want to hug you, bro.

1:14:53.500 --> 1:14:57.333
But the rascal on the left
is keeping an eye on us.

1:14:57.417 --> 1:14:58.333
Look.

1:15:00.333 --> 1:15:04.500
Dad. The Boss has Shiv in his grip.
Yes. He's too good.

1:15:06.500 --> 1:15:09.375
Now play along with me.

1:15:10.125 --> 1:15:12.042
But I can't act.

1:15:12.875 --> 1:15:15.958
That's the problem with you new-comers.

1:15:16.625 --> 1:15:19.292
That's why I've come prepared.

1:15:21.500 --> 1:15:25.083
Look. Take a good look. Look.

1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:29.417
-This is the lion's paw.
-Yes.

1:15:30.542 --> 1:15:35.458
If that's a paw, then I have
a strong hand.

1:15:36.417 --> 1:15:41.292
And when I pound someone with this,
he never gets up again.

1:15:42.083 --> 1:15:43.208
Strong arm!

1:15:43.458 --> 1:15:46.583
Dad, Shiv turned out to be
a Sunny Deol fan.

1:15:49.250 --> 1:15:52.333
You'll be the one running for your life
when you see this muscle.

1:15:52.500 --> 1:15:55.833
These aren't muscles, but fire.

1:15:57.417 --> 1:15:58.750
Look carefully.

1:16:01.583 --> 1:16:04.375
Don't do me any A.R. Rehman?

1:16:09.875 --> 1:16:11.458
Where's A.R. Rehman?

1:16:14.333 --> 1:16:15.208
Who?

1:16:17.208 --> 1:16:20.875
Do me a favor, don't do me any favors.
I'll do just one favor for you.

1:16:21.458 --> 1:16:24.375
And that's it...

1:16:27.708 --> 1:16:29.458
I've lost it now.

1:16:32.667 --> 1:16:38.792
-Now push me down. Snatch my gun and run.
-That wasn't for you to read, do it fool.

1:16:39.083 --> 1:16:42.625
-Prove what you say and I'll believe it.
-Yes.

1:16:43.458 --> 1:16:45.750
Rascal. Attacking from the back.

1:16:45.917 --> 1:16:48.333
Shiv and the Boss are fighting,

1:16:51.750 --> 1:16:53.250
The gun's in Shiv's hands.

1:17:00.625 --> 1:17:02.417
-Take the gun.
-What?

1:17:02.625 --> 1:17:03.792
Take the gun.

1:17:06.542 --> 1:17:10.208
Don't run. Don't run. Don't take my car.

1:17:12.875 --> 1:17:15.750
Don't change gears. It's automatic.

1:17:17.667 --> 1:17:19.542
-Don't move.
-Don't drive too fast.

1:17:19.792 --> 1:17:22.667
-Don't drive too fast.
-Stop. Hey!

1:17:27.708 --> 1:17:29.833
He humiliated me and escaped.

1:17:34.833 --> 1:17:40.208
He'll run out of petrol someday.
That day I'll gun him down.

1:17:41.167 --> 1:17:42.667
Scoundrel!

1:17:45.583 --> 1:17:49.500
Hello, son. What happened?
Did the Boss kill Shiv?

1:17:51.125 --> 1:17:52.417
No, Dad.

1:17:53.083 --> 1:17:55.917
-He grew plants.
-Grew plants?

1:17:57.000 --> 1:17:57.958
Grew plants?

1:18:08.542 --> 1:18:12.833
Move aside man can't you see
The Boss is coming?

1:18:20.917 --> 1:18:26.500
I never spare, I beat up and thrash
Those who lock horns with me

1:18:26.750 --> 1:18:32.292
I never spare, I beat up and thrash
Those who lock horns with me

1:18:32.375 --> 1:18:35.250
With the straightened collar
And the torn jeans

1:18:35.333 --> 1:18:40.458
With the world tied around my finger
I move on merrily

1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:43.833
Swaying left and right

1:18:43.917 --> 1:18:48.250
The fun is full-on who can stop me?

1:18:49.792 --> 1:18:53.167
The fun is full-on who can stop me?

1:18:55.625 --> 1:19:01.333
I never spare, I beat up and thrash
Those who lock horns with me

1:19:23.250 --> 1:19:28.958
If anyone talks with an attitude
I'll string him up on the moon

1:19:29.042 --> 1:19:33.833
I've got a carefree attitude

1:19:34.875 --> 1:19:37.667
I'm the Boss while the rest
Are my slaves

1:19:37.750 --> 1:19:40.667
All the while they salute me

1:19:40.750 --> 1:19:45.750
The world follows my rules

1:19:46.542 --> 1:19:51.917
I know I am stubborn
But I have a clear heart

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:55.167
That's the song I strum on my guitar

1:19:55.250 --> 1:20:00.375
And without a worry on my mind
I move on happily

1:20:00.667 --> 1:20:03.750
Swaying left and right

1:20:03.917 --> 1:20:07.042
The fun is full-on who can stop me?

1:20:09.625 --> 1:20:12.792
The fun is full-on who can stop me?

1:20:14.542 --> 1:20:18.208
It's not over yet fool beat the drums

1:20:21.625 --> 1:20:23.708
Play the guitar

1:20:27.708 --> 1:20:30.875
Now the flute don't you want
To catch your breath?

1:20:34.333 --> 1:20:35.958
Orchestra play

1:20:41.833 --> 1:20:47.542
I have a simple philosophy
Live life filled with fun and frolicking

1:20:47.625 --> 1:20:52.042
I want the heart to always be happy

1:20:53.417 --> 1:20:59.167
I am amazing,
you can ask all the beauties

1:20:59.417 --> 1:21:04.333
I make their hearts beat

1:21:04.833 --> 1:21:10.542
My news is all over the papers
every day

1:21:10.750 --> 1:21:13.667
I love on my own terms

1:21:13.833 --> 1:21:17.708
If you don't believe me,
You can ask anyone

1:21:19.250 --> 1:21:24.625
I move on merrily
Swaying left and right

1:21:25.375 --> 1:21:29.083
The fun is full-on who can stop me?

1:21:31.500 --> 1:21:37.083
I never spare, I beat up and thrash
Those who lock horns with me

1:21:37.292 --> 1:21:42.792
I never spare, I beat up and thrash
Those who lock horns with me

1:21:53.167 --> 1:21:56.083
Don't tell father I'm here.

1:21:56.667 --> 1:21:58.583
-Go.
-Why?

1:21:59.458 --> 1:22:02.292
You got me exempted from
all the charges and set me free.

1:22:02.417 --> 1:22:05.500
Maybe father will be pleased upon
hearing this and might forget the--

1:22:05.583 --> 1:22:06.667
What, Shiv?

1:22:07.625 --> 1:22:10.333
Are you crazy?
You're getting carried away.

1:22:11.250 --> 1:22:14.625
I'm just a goon-for-hire for father. Goon!

1:22:14.958 --> 1:22:19.417
If he finds out, he'll sell his property
and give me my final payment.

1:22:19.708 --> 1:22:21.292
I know my father.

1:22:21.833 --> 1:22:23.833
-Welcome. Welcome.
-My father is self-respecting.

1:22:23.917 --> 1:22:25.000
He'll be stubborn.

1:22:26.708 --> 1:22:27.583
Go on.

1:22:27.750 --> 1:22:30.417
Tell him you got out of jail on your own.

1:22:30.542 --> 1:22:31.417
Go.

1:22:32.708 --> 1:22:35.250
Why? What about your happiness?

1:22:37.125 --> 1:22:38.292
Your feelings?

1:22:39.792 --> 1:22:41.208
What about my feelings?

1:22:42.083 --> 1:22:45.458
All I want is to get water, what else?

1:22:45.958 --> 1:22:49.500
Go on. Go on. Go on. Go on.

1:22:50.167 --> 1:22:51.042
Go.

1:22:52.917 --> 1:22:54.625
It's normal in the market.

1:22:55.292 --> 1:22:56.708
-There he is.
-Father.

1:23:05.292 --> 1:23:07.458
Son. How are you?

1:23:07.542 --> 1:23:09.333
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

1:23:09.542 --> 1:23:12.042
-You're looking nice.
-Yes. Yes.

1:23:19.792 --> 1:23:21.250
-Is everything okay?
-Yes.

1:23:21.333 --> 1:23:22.458
-All okay.
-Yes, father.

1:23:22.542 --> 1:23:23.417
Shall we go?

1:23:53.417 --> 1:23:56.208
What? Scared of all these men?

1:23:56.708 --> 1:23:59.667
No, normally there's always
a bunch of beggars outside the temple.

1:24:00.083 --> 1:24:01.542
Minister Pradhan's sent us.

1:24:01.625 --> 1:24:03.208
We're here to take you
to ACP Pradhan's farmhouse.

1:24:03.292 --> 1:24:05.000
Come quietly or else we'll beat you up.

1:24:05.083 --> 1:24:11.417
No. I am scared. I'm frightened.
Look at this, I'm getting goosebumps.

1:24:11.500 --> 1:24:15.917
Don't beat me. Don't beat me. Boss. Run!

1:27:17.250 --> 1:27:18.208
Jump.

1:27:21.333 --> 1:27:22.292
You jump.

1:27:30.833 --> 1:27:33.167
Tell me something, will anybody
be at home?

1:27:36.375 --> 1:27:40.167
Daddy, the Boss is here all alone.
Where are our goons?

1:27:43.125 --> 1:27:44.750
Hello, sir.

1:27:45.833 --> 1:27:48.583
I could've pulverized your goons
back there,

1:27:48.750 --> 1:27:51.500
but then I had an idea.

1:27:51.667 --> 1:27:55.208
I left the rascals back in those lanes,
and I came visiting your home.

1:27:55.292 --> 1:27:57.792
And thought, why don't I come
to your home,

1:27:57.875 --> 1:28:02.208
drink water in your house,
and break their bones here.

1:28:07.625 --> 1:28:09.833
-Sir, you know--
-Don't interfere!

1:28:28.917 --> 1:28:30.167
What do I care?

1:28:30.458 --> 1:28:33.083
-All I want is to--
-Get water out.

1:28:49.083 --> 1:28:50.667
Welcome, Tauji.

1:28:52.208 --> 1:28:55.708
I've invited him here especially
to tell him about your deeds,

1:28:55.875 --> 1:28:57.375
and to show him too.

1:28:58.625 --> 1:29:02.708
Your man has taken our contract
and he's been beating up our men

1:29:02.792 --> 1:29:05.458
-instead of doing the job.
-Enough!

1:29:07.167 --> 1:29:12.875
My rule is we can sacrifice our kin
but never fail from completing a contract.

1:29:14.542 --> 1:29:17.708
Sometimes, we all make mistakes.

1:29:19.042 --> 1:29:24.708
In life, we often make small mistakes,
as well as big ones.

1:29:25.042 --> 1:29:27.875
They are 3D villains.
Three generous villains.

1:29:28.042 --> 1:29:30.458
They gave me one chance
to catch that scoundrel.

1:29:30.542 --> 1:29:33.625
They'll give me a second chance.
A third, fourth, fifth--

1:29:34.125 --> 1:29:35.000
Stop it.

1:29:35.500 --> 1:29:37.333
Are you going to keep running
after him all your life?

1:29:37.417 --> 1:29:38.292
Mr. Pradhan.

1:29:42.167 --> 1:29:43.083
What did you say?

1:29:44.292 --> 1:29:45.167
What did you say?

1:29:45.250 --> 1:29:47.667
We cancel the contract we gave you.

1:29:50.958 --> 1:29:55.417
Uncle, you heard.
They cancelled the contract.

1:29:55.625 --> 1:29:59.667
When the contract's cancelled
there's no question of betrayal.

1:29:59.917 --> 1:30:02.708
Now I'll make a call.

1:30:03.750 --> 1:30:05.250
Zoravar!

1:30:06.375 --> 1:30:08.083
Were you waiting on the pole?

1:30:08.958 --> 1:30:12.375
Contract cancelled, advance returned.

1:30:17.958 --> 1:30:19.917
Darling Ankita. Go inside.

1:30:21.667 --> 1:30:22.917
Ankita, hold on.

1:30:26.167 --> 1:30:27.792
Did you have to interfere?

1:30:28.208 --> 1:30:29.125
Hello.

1:30:30.958 --> 1:30:35.125
I'll come straight to the point.
Do you love Shiv?

1:30:43.833 --> 1:30:45.125
Hey. Move aside.

1:30:45.792 --> 1:30:48.250
Your brother wants to get you
married to that moron.

1:30:48.750 --> 1:30:50.708
-Moron?
-Look at his face.

1:30:52.417 --> 1:30:54.583
Do you love Shiv?

1:30:56.583 --> 1:30:57.458
Yes.

1:30:58.208 --> 1:30:59.917
Do you want to marry him?

1:31:01.750 --> 1:31:03.458
-Yes.
-Yes!

1:31:05.500 --> 1:31:06.708
Don't be mad.

1:31:07.375 --> 1:31:08.875
He has an entire army with him.

1:31:08.958 --> 1:31:14.125
The Boss announces a contract
to get Shiv and Ankita married.

1:31:14.208 --> 1:31:18.250
But Boss, how can you start the contract
without money in advance?

1:31:18.333 --> 1:31:19.792
This is against your system.

1:31:19.875 --> 1:31:21.750
-You're right.
-Yes.

1:31:24.458 --> 1:31:26.833
-Hey moron, come here.
-Yes, Boss.

1:31:27.792 --> 1:31:30.000
-That's it. I have the money in advance.
-Fine.

1:31:30.083 --> 1:31:32.958
Brothers will pay for their sister's
improvement.

1:31:34.375 --> 1:31:35.333
Fool.

1:31:36.542 --> 1:31:37.417
No.

1:31:39.542 --> 1:31:43.417
He's getting Shiv married
to Ankita instead of killing him.

1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:45.375
Why don't you say something?

1:31:45.625 --> 1:31:51.917
The Boss has taken up a new contract.
The rules say you may sacrifice a kin.

1:31:52.125 --> 1:31:55.708
But never miss a contract.

1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:58.833
And anyway, this is about
blood-ties and not a contract.

1:31:58.958 --> 1:32:03.125
Because Shiv is my brother.

1:32:06.750 --> 1:32:08.333
I'll say it three times.

1:32:08.458 --> 1:32:11.458
He's my brother. My brother. My brother.

1:32:16.375 --> 1:32:17.833
Remember.

1:32:18.333 --> 1:32:21.792
The Boss' blood boils.

1:32:22.125 --> 1:32:27.375
And when it does, he spares no one.

1:32:50.250 --> 1:32:53.292
You were right, Ayushman.
We should've burnt him.

1:32:53.375 --> 1:32:56.500
We should've buried him. Go on--

1:33:00.375 --> 1:33:01.458
Didn't you hear?

1:33:02.750 --> 1:33:05.833
Shiv is the Boss' brother. Brother.

1:33:07.250 --> 1:33:13.833
The Boss is being over-enthusiastic,
but I'm going to use my brains.

1:33:15.250 --> 1:33:17.875
By playing the right
card at the right moment.

1:33:21.792 --> 1:33:25.292
Daddy. By the time he plays his cards

1:33:25.417 --> 1:33:30.167
Shiv and Ankita will already
have their honeymoon.

1:33:31.250 --> 1:33:32.625
I'm a moron.

1:33:32.875 --> 1:33:37.833
Hold on. Jabbar bhai.
Dad, call Jabbar bhai right now.

1:33:37.958 --> 1:33:40.500
On the spot, finish his entire family
right now.

1:33:41.875 --> 1:33:43.792
-Father's here.
-So what?

1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:45.833
-Father's here.
-Shiv?

1:33:46.917 --> 1:33:51.375
I told you we'll be visiting
the saint's tomb one day.

1:33:51.458 --> 1:33:53.333
And return to Benaras after that.

1:33:53.917 --> 1:33:56.708
We'll visit the shrine today.
It is a good day.

1:33:57.375 --> 1:34:00.583
I'm pleased that you've been released.

1:34:01.375 --> 1:34:07.417
And I'm even happier that you didn't need
that goon's help for it.

1:34:15.542 --> 1:34:19.750
-Brother. Brother, come in.
-No, actually I couldn't do the job.

1:34:19.833 --> 1:34:22.167
So I'm here to return
Mr. Satyakant's money.

1:34:22.833 --> 1:34:24.458
Brother, come in.

1:34:24.708 --> 1:34:27.042
-I'll leave.
-Please. Brother, come.

1:34:29.125 --> 1:34:33.667
-I'm going to the shrine. Are you coming?
-Yes, Father.

1:34:34.625 --> 1:34:36.083
Can brother come along too?

1:34:36.833 --> 1:34:38.792
Everyone has a free will.

1:34:39.375 --> 1:34:43.208
They can come if they want to,
but if they don't want to...

1:34:46.375 --> 1:34:48.167
it doesn't make a difference to me.

1:35:35.833 --> 1:35:37.167
How much is this?

1:36:07.375 --> 1:36:08.833
You dare attack from behind?

1:37:08.167 --> 1:37:09.750
Come on, put it in neutral.

1:37:15.625 --> 1:37:18.708
-Who is it?
-Jabbar sir, it wasn't us.

1:37:30.583 --> 1:37:35.708
Here. Get yourself treated. Here. Goodbye.

1:37:37.792 --> 1:37:39.917
That's Jabbar the beggar...

1:37:54.542 --> 1:37:58.333
-What happened? Did the tank explode?
-No, you've been exposed.

1:37:58.792 --> 1:38:00.042
Take a look. Look!

1:38:00.250 --> 1:38:03.208
Last night was the most embarrassing night
in the history of politics.

1:38:03.792 --> 1:38:05.833
The entire country was shocked
to see this.

1:38:06.167 --> 1:38:08.458
Twenty-five MLAs of minister
Vishwas Pradhan

1:38:08.792 --> 1:38:10.625
were caught along with
prostitutes late in the night

1:38:10.708 --> 1:38:13.292
and in front of the entire media.

1:38:13.833 --> 1:38:16.250
The unknown person that informed
the media calls himself a social-worker.

1:38:16.333 --> 1:38:18.333
This is a conspiracy of the opposition.

1:38:18.417 --> 1:38:22.750
The parliament speaker has decided
to suspend all the MLAs.

1:38:22.875 --> 1:38:27.792
And the ruling have given a statement that
they are ready for a hung assembly.

1:38:27.875 --> 1:38:30.833
But they will never take the support
of these MLAs...

1:38:31.292 --> 1:38:32.833
I am ruined.

1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:38.833
-My power has gone.
-And wife too.

1:38:39.375 --> 1:38:42.375
Rascal, swine, pervert.

1:38:42.542 --> 1:38:43.417
Yes!

1:38:43.500 --> 1:38:45.792
Is this why you disappeared
every other day?

1:38:47.750 --> 1:38:49.292
No, no, I...

1:38:56.208 --> 1:38:58.125
I snatched your power.

1:38:58.542 --> 1:39:04.125
Next time you attack my father,
I'll pull the earth from under your feet.

1:39:04.375 --> 1:39:08.458
And this isn't just a statement,
it's the Boss' prediction.

1:39:16.708 --> 1:39:18.750
Ankita has to come, sir.

1:39:19.167 --> 1:39:22.583
Shivani is a common friend.

1:39:22.833 --> 1:39:25.042
And her mom's in the ICU.

1:39:29.667 --> 1:39:35.792
So I thought, if Ankita just met
Shivani once, she will feel better.

1:39:36.292 --> 1:39:40.458
And anyway,
I couldn't contact Ankita earlier.

1:39:40.917 --> 1:39:42.583
So I had to come here.

1:39:45.542 --> 1:39:47.250
Okay. Take her along.

1:39:49.375 --> 1:39:50.250
But...

1:40:01.375 --> 1:40:04.333
you will bring Ankita back home.

1:40:06.167 --> 1:40:09.625
sooner than Shivani's
mother who's eager to die.

1:40:10.292 --> 1:40:12.083
Okay, sir.

1:40:13.042 --> 1:40:15.083
I'll bring her back home soon.

1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:18.958
Go.

1:40:24.292 --> 1:40:25.458
Poor Shivani.

1:40:26.542 --> 1:40:27.542
What happened?

1:40:27.708 --> 1:40:32.083
I'm taking you to Shiv not Shivani.

1:40:34.792 --> 1:40:40.792
Shivani's mom is all right.
Now call him. Here's my phone.

1:40:46.583 --> 1:40:48.417
Ankita, how are you?

1:40:48.542 --> 1:40:52.208
I wasn't okay until now,
but I'll feel better after I see you.

1:40:52.292 --> 1:40:54.458
Actually,
I'm going out to see my brother.

1:40:54.542 --> 1:40:57.083
He's throwing a party today.
Why don't you two come too.

1:40:57.167 --> 1:40:59.083
He's invited influential people.

1:40:59.208 --> 1:41:01.833
Fine, send me the address. I'll be there.

1:41:02.208 --> 1:41:03.667
Okay, I'll send it right now.

1:41:14.667 --> 1:41:18.542
Open up the bottle
Let the alcohol pour

1:41:18.625 --> 1:41:22.208
Take a shot and forget the world

1:41:29.500 --> 1:41:33.125
Hear me out everyone
No matter how hard you try

1:41:33.208 --> 1:41:37.167
We'll party all night
Stop us if you can

1:41:44.250 --> 1:41:47.917
Hear me out everyone
No matter how hard you try

1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:51.583
We'll party all night
Stop us if you can

1:41:51.667 --> 1:41:55.333
Open up the bottles
Let the alcohol pour

1:41:55.417 --> 1:41:59.042
Take a peg and forget the world

1:41:59.500 --> 1:42:02.625
Keep playing on everyone
Keep playing on

1:42:02.708 --> 1:42:06.917
Everyone keep playing on
Everyone keep playing on

1:42:26.750 --> 1:42:30.292
Anyone who wants to party come inside

1:42:30.375 --> 1:42:34.042
Whisky and chicken to relish

1:42:34.125 --> 1:42:37.750
Girls from Noida, Gurgaon
and Delhi have come over

1:42:37.833 --> 1:42:41.292
They've also brought CDs of Yo-Yo

1:42:41.375 --> 1:42:45.167
Passengers are responsible
for their luggage

1:42:45.250 --> 1:42:48.750
Party all night, tomorrow's Sunday

1:42:48.833 --> 1:42:52.292
When the music plays loud
Aunt will call the police

1:42:52.375 --> 1:42:56.167
Someone tell Aunt
the party will still go on

1:43:03.667 --> 1:43:07.292
Aunt will call the police
Aunt will call the police

1:43:07.375 --> 1:43:11.000
Aunt will call the police
Aunt will call the police

1:43:11.083 --> 1:43:14.667
Hear me out everyone
No matter how hard you try

1:43:14.750 --> 1:43:18.333
We'll party all night
Stop us if you can

1:43:18.417 --> 1:43:22.083
Open up the bottles
Let the alcohol pour

1:43:22.167 --> 1:43:26.250
Take a sip and forget the world

1:43:26.333 --> 1:43:29.375
Keep playing on
Everyone keep playing on

1:43:29.458 --> 1:43:33.375
Everyone keep playing on
Everyone keep playing on

1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:51.625
Free booze, free food, everyone's saying
No going home tonight

1:43:51.708 --> 1:43:55.333
Message your dad
Make some excuse and come join me

1:43:55.417 --> 1:43:59.000
The party is too good
The views are just stunning

1:43:59.083 --> 1:44:02.750
There's just one problem
Uncle is still a bachelor

1:44:02.875 --> 1:44:06.333
The girls in shorts are
gulping down vodka

1:44:06.417 --> 1:44:10.125
She can't finish one,
but she's ordered another

1:44:10.208 --> 1:44:13.833
Look at her dance
She's setting the stage on fire

1:44:13.917 --> 1:44:17.542
Look at you
you're creating a commotion

1:44:24.958 --> 1:44:28.500
Aunt will call the police
Aunt will call the police

1:44:28.583 --> 1:44:32.042
Aunt will call the police
Aunt will call the police

1:44:32.125 --> 1:44:35.792
Still the party will go on
The party will go on

1:44:35.875 --> 1:44:39.542
The party will go on
The party will go on

1:44:39.625 --> 1:44:43.208
Hear me out everyone
No matter how hard you try

1:44:43.292 --> 1:44:47.083
We'll party all night
Stop us if you can

1:44:47.167 --> 1:44:50.833
Open up the bottles
Let the alcohol pour

1:44:50.917 --> 1:44:54.625
Take a shot and forget the world

1:44:55.083 --> 1:44:58.083
Keep playing on
Everyone keep playing on

1:44:58.167 --> 1:45:01.750
Everyone keep playing on
Everyone keep playing on

1:45:01.833 --> 1:45:05.417
Aunt will call the police
Aunt will call the police

1:45:05.500 --> 1:45:08.958
Aunt will call the police
Aunt will call the police

1:45:09.042 --> 1:45:12.750
The party will go on
The party will go on

1:45:12.833 --> 1:45:17.042
The party will go on
The party will go on

1:45:19.125 --> 1:45:21.292
Sonakshi, I really liked
that you attended the party.

1:45:21.375 --> 1:45:22.250
Me too.

1:45:25.417 --> 1:45:26.417
Just a minute.

1:45:27.167 --> 1:45:28.083
Yes.

1:45:31.833 --> 1:45:32.708
Fine.

1:45:34.208 --> 1:45:38.875
Shiv. The police are beating up my men.
I've got to go.

1:45:39.083 --> 1:45:43.000
Take Ankita and Dimple home, okay?
Look after yourself.

1:45:45.750 --> 1:45:49.083
-When will we meet again?
-At the end of the movie.

1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:05.750
Hurry up, please.
Or else my dad will kill me.

1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:44.917
On one hand you claim
to love my sister.

1:46:46.208 --> 1:46:48.125
And on the other you
rape her best friend.

1:46:49.333 --> 1:46:51.167
Rape. Rape. Rape.

1:46:51.625 --> 1:46:54.542
What nonsense! Dimple, what happened?
How did this happen?

1:46:54.625 --> 1:46:56.208
-Tell him--
-She's already said everything.

1:46:56.292 --> 1:46:58.208
She's given her statement.
Read it.

1:46:58.417 --> 1:47:02.000
Shiv brought me to Kurukshetra
which is 142 kilometers from Delhi

1:47:02.083 --> 1:47:04.250
-and raped me in this car.
- Enough.

1:47:04.333 --> 1:47:06.458
I'll handle it from here. Hear that?

1:47:16.208 --> 1:47:17.375
Ayushman, you don't know--

1:47:17.458 --> 1:47:20.042
You don't know that rape
is a serious crime.

1:47:20.208 --> 1:47:25.958
No bail and a long prison sentence.
You'll live like a dog, understand?

1:47:26.208 --> 1:47:28.625
You're trying to trap me in this.
Dimple's lying.

1:47:28.708 --> 1:47:30.208
-You know--
-Who's lying?

1:47:30.333 --> 1:47:34.333
She's lying. Would a decent girl
defame herself?

1:47:34.583 --> 1:47:36.083
Did she bring you here?

1:47:36.750 --> 1:47:39.583
Did she bring you here?
You didn't bring her.

1:47:39.875 --> 1:47:42.458
She drugged the water.

1:47:42.542 --> 1:47:44.958
She made you drink it.
She got you unconscious.

1:47:49.417 --> 1:47:50.750
Listen, boy.

1:47:55.083 --> 1:47:56.625
You were stuck on her figure.

1:48:02.625 --> 1:48:04.750
-Come out.
-Ayushman, what are you doing?

1:48:04.833 --> 1:48:06.500
-Come on.
-Ayushman, this is wrong.

1:48:06.792 --> 1:48:10.292
Ayushman, you're doing the wrong thing.
What are you doing?

1:48:10.375 --> 1:48:13.417
I am doing my duty,
and now I'm going to screw you over.

1:48:13.542 --> 1:48:15.958
-Ayushman, you--
-Hold on.

1:48:16.458 --> 1:48:17.333
What?

1:48:19.417 --> 1:48:20.292
What?

1:48:22.167 --> 1:48:24.958
You think Dimple's a part of my plan?

1:48:26.250 --> 1:48:29.667
Is that what you think? You are right.

1:48:30.458 --> 1:48:33.292
She is part of my plan.
She sleeps with me every night.

1:48:33.375 --> 1:48:37.792
So she can at least do this much, Boss.
That reminds me...

1:48:45.792 --> 1:48:46.708
Look...

1:48:47.875 --> 1:48:49.500
let's forget what you think.

1:48:50.708 --> 1:48:54.917
Think about what your brother's dilemma
when he finds out.

1:48:55.792 --> 1:49:01.792
Kurukshetra. The Boss' land of destiny.
He's honored and respected here.

1:49:03.958 --> 1:49:06.208
I'll get a real kick out of this.

1:49:07.458 --> 1:49:10.625
When I defame your brother using you.

1:49:11.875 --> 1:49:14.750
I'll humiliate you and he'll feel ashamed.

1:49:15.542 --> 1:49:17.167
That's why they say...

1:49:19.458 --> 1:49:22.083
people defame death.

1:49:24.250 --> 1:49:28.208
Life... makes you suffer.

1:49:33.875 --> 1:49:37.458
This is the second time I've hit someone.

1:49:38.292 --> 1:49:41.417
And both times it was you, only you.

1:49:43.833 --> 1:49:49.125
I was scared since the moment I learnt

1:49:49.542 --> 1:49:51.458
Shiv was going around with you.

1:49:52.208 --> 1:49:55.542
Now he's paying for it. Behind bars.

1:49:55.958 --> 1:49:58.167
And only you are responsible. Just you.

1:49:58.250 --> 1:49:59.708
Look, Satyakant.

1:50:00.042 --> 1:50:03.708
-It's not his--
-It's his fault and yours too.

1:50:04.375 --> 1:50:07.625
I know about your real job
under the pretext of transport.

1:50:07.917 --> 1:50:11.833
He chose crime,
but you showed him the way.

1:50:12.833 --> 1:50:16.833
He was a murderer,
but you made him a criminal.

1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:19.208
-And that's the truth.
-See...

1:50:20.042 --> 1:50:23.375
it's you who doesn't know the truth
and you're blaming me.

1:50:23.625 --> 1:50:26.583
-I'll tell you--
-Uncle. Don't say anything.

1:50:27.500 --> 1:50:28.792
Don't say a word.

1:50:29.875 --> 1:50:32.708
What are you saying? I will tell him.

1:50:33.417 --> 1:50:35.583
You're worth just one thing.

1:50:36.292 --> 1:50:37.250
Hatred.

1:50:47.333 --> 1:50:49.250
You're right, Mr. Satyakant.

1:50:50.708 --> 1:50:54.083
I'm worthy of what I've
been getting all my life.

1:50:55.208 --> 1:50:56.083
Hatred.

1:50:58.875 --> 1:51:00.583
But I promise you...

1:51:01.958 --> 1:51:07.083
Shiv will be out before sunrise tomorrow.

1:51:08.375 --> 1:51:13.042
And if he doesn't then
the sun won't rise tomorrow.

1:51:15.208 --> 1:51:18.208
What have you done, Satyakant?

1:51:18.417 --> 1:51:21.083
-Your own son--
-He's not my son!

1:51:22.333 --> 1:51:26.708
Someone who chose crime over his father
can't be my son.

1:51:26.792 --> 1:51:27.667
Enough!

1:51:28.167 --> 1:51:29.500
Stop it, Satyakant.

1:51:31.375 --> 1:51:32.583
Fifteen years.

1:51:33.958 --> 1:51:36.875
For 15 years, I raised him like a son.

1:51:37.792 --> 1:51:42.500
But for him,
you're still his father, his God.

1:51:43.500 --> 1:51:45.875
He keeps your red towel...

1:51:46.708 --> 1:51:50.833
closer to him than his heart.

1:51:52.083 --> 1:51:55.875
I don't know whether he's your son or not
but he surely is yours.

1:51:57.750 --> 1:52:00.208
Do you know what happened years ago...

1:52:00.792 --> 1:52:04.875
In that school which ruined Surya's life?

1:52:06.125 --> 1:52:07.625
You don't know the truth!

1:52:08.458 --> 1:52:09.750
You know nothing!

1:52:11.500 --> 1:52:14.750
If you have the strength
to hear the truth...

1:52:15.167 --> 1:52:16.458
then hear me out.

1:52:16.750 --> 1:52:21.583
Until you two patch this up,
you will stay locked in the same room.

1:54:10.250 --> 1:54:13.792
You've seen Surya's temper...

1:54:15.042 --> 1:54:16.417
but not his generosity.

1:54:17.292 --> 1:54:18.583
Careful.

1:54:37.417 --> 1:54:39.042
Where's my son?

1:54:43.417 --> 1:54:44.667
Where's my son?

1:54:45.375 --> 1:54:47.042
I'll take you to him.

1:54:48.125 --> 1:54:49.417
I'll take you to him.

1:54:58.875 --> 1:55:01.958
-What does he want?
-What?

1:55:11.042 --> 1:55:13.250
Why does it hurt so much?

1:55:19.042 --> 1:55:20.667
Why did you tie my hands?

1:55:20.833 --> 1:55:23.208
Sir, I want to know.

1:55:23.625 --> 1:55:28.667
How do we make a mini time-bomb?
What's the procedure?

1:55:29.042 --> 1:55:30.667
-It's simple.
-I see.

1:55:30.875 --> 1:55:35.708
First of all, you pour RDX
in a bowl of Nitric acid.

1:55:36.083 --> 1:55:41.792
Then fasten it with nuts and bolts.
And detonate it with a hand-made remote.

1:55:43.500 --> 1:55:48.875
What wow! What are you two talking about?
It's hurting.

1:55:49.500 --> 1:55:54.500
Tying me here isn't going to help you.
I'll call Dad.

1:55:54.625 --> 1:55:56.625
My phone. Dad. My phone.

1:55:56.708 --> 1:55:58.583
-Your phone.
-Here you go.

1:55:58.667 --> 1:56:00.542
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Call him.

1:56:00.625 --> 1:56:01.708
Now watch.

1:56:04.917 --> 1:56:07.708
My car, my car!

1:56:09.958 --> 1:56:14.250
Wrong button. Don't jump around.

1:56:15.042 --> 1:56:18.083
I've fitted a similar bomb in your back.

1:56:18.625 --> 1:56:21.250
Boss. What do you call this bomb?

1:56:23.792 --> 1:56:27.458
Bomb in my bum! Bomb in my bum!

1:56:27.542 --> 1:56:31.000
Yes. You see, for the first time
in the history of the world,

1:56:31.083 --> 1:56:34.958
the Boss fitted a bomb in your center,
and not on the right!

1:56:35.125 --> 1:56:38.000
Don't believe it? Boss, switch it on.

1:56:41.958 --> 1:56:44.333
Hold on. Hold on. Stop it. Stop it.

1:56:44.417 --> 1:56:47.250
-Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
-He's already scared.

1:56:49.167 --> 1:56:51.083
What do I do, what do I not do?

1:56:51.208 --> 1:56:56.500
First of all, don't try to disarm it
or you'll explode.

1:56:58.083 --> 1:57:02.167
Second, don't ever sit down anywhere.

1:57:02.375 --> 1:57:03.792
Otherwise you'll explode.

1:57:04.375 --> 1:57:10.625
Third, no more eating lentils,
kidney beans, fritters...

1:57:10.958 --> 1:57:14.583
If you fart, you'll breathe
your last breath.

1:57:14.667 --> 1:57:16.042
And you'll explode.

1:57:16.167 --> 1:57:18.375
-Fourth--
-What nonsense.

1:57:18.458 --> 1:57:21.625
I'm scared to death here.
What's the solution?

1:57:21.708 --> 1:57:23.333
You've three hours.

1:57:23.667 --> 1:57:27.208
Before you run out of time,
take the help of your father.

1:57:27.417 --> 1:57:30.750
Go to Kurukshetra. Get Shiv out of jail.

1:57:30.958 --> 1:57:35.042
And if you leave any loose ends...

1:57:39.833 --> 1:57:42.792
We can have issues about
rights with the music companies.

1:57:42.875 --> 1:57:44.333
Yeah, they can file a case.

1:57:48.625 --> 1:57:50.708
There's a bomb in your trunk

1:57:52.500 --> 1:57:55.625
-Sing again.
-Daddy!

1:58:12.083 --> 1:58:14.500
-Careful. Keep your legs apart.
-Yes.

1:58:14.833 --> 1:58:17.917
We kept our promise, now you keep yours.

1:58:18.375 --> 1:58:21.000
-Only four minutes left.
-Three minutes.

1:58:21.083 --> 1:58:22.167
Daddy, three minutes.

1:58:22.250 --> 1:58:26.875
You see, the one that fitted
the bomb, will get it out.

1:58:26.958 --> 1:58:27.958
Who's that?

1:58:44.292 --> 1:58:47.042
He fixes the taps
of all the ministers.

1:58:49.875 --> 1:58:51.625
Time's running out, Boss.

1:58:51.875 --> 1:58:54.292
The easiest and simplest way is

1:58:54.375 --> 1:58:58.875
to first tear apart
his seat and then rip it out.

1:58:59.125 --> 1:59:01.542
Tear apart? Rip out? Daddy?

1:59:04.375 --> 1:59:05.667
Trying to scare us!

1:59:07.583 --> 1:59:11.958
-He's a liar. Liar.
-No liar. Pliers.

1:59:12.292 --> 1:59:14.917
Come on, coward. Behind the car tire.

1:59:16.458 --> 1:59:18.917
Boss. I've become a poet.

1:59:19.625 --> 1:59:21.625
Boss. I'm really going
to enjoy watching this.

1:59:23.083 --> 1:59:24.542
Just 1.5 minutes left.

1:59:25.333 --> 1:59:27.125
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's get it out.

1:59:27.208 --> 1:59:29.458
-I'll get it out in a jiffy.
-Have fun.

1:59:29.542 --> 1:59:31.083
-Careful.
-Twenty-two seconds.

1:59:35.333 --> 1:59:36.375
Go on.

1:59:37.500 --> 1:59:41.333
Tell him what you want.
Don't worry. Go on.

1:59:50.958 --> 1:59:54.125
Until today I was afraid
because you were my brother.

1:59:55.833 --> 1:59:57.208
But I'm not scared anymore.

1:59:58.500 --> 2:00:00.667
Because you're not worth this bond.

2:00:02.958 --> 2:00:05.583
You wanted to humiliate me
on my soil, didn't you?

2:00:06.417 --> 2:00:09.917
Now I'll get these two
married on this very soil.

2:00:11.167 --> 2:00:13.667
Because life isn't fun...

2:00:13.750 --> 2:00:18.042
if your enemies aren't jealous.

2:00:18.833 --> 2:00:21.208
Let's go. Party.

2:00:36.458 --> 2:00:39.208
-Is Boss here?
-He just left.

2:00:39.292 --> 2:00:40.833
-But why are you--
-Where did he go?

2:00:40.917 --> 2:00:42.667
I know everything now.

2:00:49.417 --> 2:00:50.917
This time...

2:00:52.375 --> 2:00:53.958
death is going to be painful.

2:01:39.750 --> 2:01:41.375
Raghunath didn't make it.

2:01:42.208 --> 2:01:43.250
And your fatherâ€¦

2:01:47.208 --> 2:01:48.833
I couldn't control myself, son.

2:01:50.583 --> 2:01:52.167
I had to tell him the truth.

2:01:53.375 --> 2:01:57.625
He was eager to see you
to apologize and hug you.

2:01:58.083 --> 2:02:01.083
I was on the way when this--

2:02:09.458 --> 2:02:13.708
Where are you? ICU or the morgue?

2:02:14.875 --> 2:02:17.780
Even if you're not in the morgue
you will soon get there.

2:02:18.667 --> 2:02:20.375
Can you talk?

2:02:21.500 --> 2:02:24.083
Or are you busy picking up the pieces?

2:02:26.208 --> 2:02:27.917
I'll be quick.

2:02:28.958 --> 2:02:31.250
Once you're done with
this emotional scene,

2:02:31.833 --> 2:02:33.750
come see me soon.

2:02:34.458 --> 2:02:37.083
I'm waiting right here for you.

2:02:38.167 --> 2:02:39.708
In Kurukshetra.

2:02:41.208 --> 2:02:46.375
I'll turn you and your
family to dust right here. It'll be fun.

2:02:48.083 --> 2:02:49.000
Come on.

2:02:49.750 --> 2:02:50.917
Hurry up.

2:02:52.250 --> 2:02:53.333
See you.

2:03:05.625 --> 2:03:07.542
I always said...

2:03:09.333 --> 2:03:11.792
eradicate your enemies with a smile.

2:03:12.625 --> 2:03:13.792
But today...

2:03:14.667 --> 2:03:17.708
you have to make him suffer to his death.

2:03:19.667 --> 2:03:22.125
You've to assume the role of Arjun...

2:03:22.792 --> 2:03:25.083
and fight this battle in Kurukshetra.

2:03:25.417 --> 2:03:28.625
You have to put that demon to bed,
forever!

2:03:47.625 --> 2:03:51.083
He's anointed himself with
the dust of his father's feet

2:03:51.167 --> 2:03:54.792
He's obsessed with
fighting for his father

2:03:54.958 --> 2:03:58.375
His blood's boiling
because of his father's hurt

2:03:58.583 --> 2:04:02.125
When the father is humiliated
the son says to the world

2:04:02.208 --> 2:04:05.792
I'll show you the bond
I share with my father

2:04:05.958 --> 2:04:09.708
I'll destroy the entire
World if my father is hurt

2:04:12.208 --> 2:04:18.917
All the gods

2:04:19.667 --> 2:04:25.583
Dwell in you

2:04:26.917 --> 2:04:32.875
All the gods

2:04:34.083 --> 2:04:40.458
Dwell in you

2:06:02.333 --> 2:06:08.042
It'll be much more fun killing you...
alone.

2:06:08.750 --> 2:06:13.250
This time you'll be facing a son,
not the Boss.

2:09:28.625 --> 2:09:33.708
I'll turn you and your
family to dust right here. It'll be fun.

2:09:33.833 --> 2:09:36.500
Even if you're not in the
morgue he will soon get there.

2:09:36.583 --> 2:09:39.583
I'm waiting right here for you.
In Kurukshetra.

2:13:53.292 --> 2:13:57.458
It's just few simple words

2:13:58.667 --> 2:14:03.083
Why is there a rift still between us?

2:14:03.458 --> 2:14:07.958
I can't say it or control it

2:14:08.667 --> 2:14:13.000
What is this helplessness?

2:14:13.583 --> 2:14:18.542
You dwell in me, I dwell in you
You're for me I'm for you

2:14:18.625 --> 2:14:23.250
It's not easy to find love here

2:14:23.833 --> 2:14:26.417
Not everyone

2:14:26.500 --> 2:14:31.500
Finds love

2:14:31.583 --> 2:14:34.000
In life

2:14:34.083 --> 2:14:36.917
Not everyone

2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:41.500
Finds love

2:14:41.583 --> 2:14:43.792
In life

2:14:43.875 --> 2:14:48.917
We're fortunate to experience

2:14:49.042 --> 2:14:53.667
This beautiful feeling in life

2:14:54.458 --> 2:14:56.583
Not everyone

2:14:56.667 --> 2:15:01.083
Finds love

2:15:01.167 --> 2:15:03.833
In life

2:15:24.792 --> 2:15:29.333
Without love life is meaningless

2:15:29.542 --> 2:15:36.208
Without a lover
devotion is meaningless

2:15:37.375 --> 2:15:41.625
Without love life is meaningless

2:15:42.083 --> 2:15:46.917
Without a lover
devotion is meaningless

2:15:47.292 --> 2:15:49.667
You're my happiness

2:15:49.792 --> 2:15:54.833
You're my love

2:15:54.917 --> 2:16:00.083
When we're together,
Everything is okay

2:16:00.167 --> 2:16:04.625
So why pretend to be strangers?

2:16:04.708 --> 2:16:09.667
You dwell in me, I dwell in you
You're for me, I'm for you

2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:14.667
It's not easy to find love here

2:16:14.792 --> 2:16:17.833
Not everyone

2:16:17.917 --> 2:16:21.625
Finds love

2:16:21.708 --> 2:16:24.458
In life

2:16:25.125 --> 2:16:27.667
Not everyone

2:16:27.750 --> 2:16:31.833
Finds love

2:16:31.917 --> 2:16:35.667
In love
