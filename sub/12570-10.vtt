I can't believe

00:04.292 --> 00:06.459
you're doing this,

00:06.500 --> 00:07.918
just because I went

00:07.919 --> 00:09.334
a little over on my

00:06.500 --> 00:09.334
phone bill this month...

00:09.375 --> 00:10.543
A little?

00:10.544 --> 00:11.709
You managed to

00:09.375 --> 00:11.709
go over your limit.

00:11.751 --> 00:13.542
- And your limit
- is unlimited!

00:14.000 --> 00:15.042
Look,

- your parents,

00:16.500 --> 00:17.626
And from now on,

00:16.500 --> 00:18.751
your own phone bill,

00:18.792 --> 00:19.792
by getting a job.

00:20.834 --> 00:21.939
Jessie, money isn't

00:21.940 --> 00:23.042
something you work for,

00:23.083 --> 00:24.518

- people give you.

00:24.542 --> 00:25.689
Like compliments,

00:25.690 --> 00:26.834

Well, welcome to

00:30.648 --> 00:32.292
a little note that says,

00:29.000 --> 00:32.292
"It's not me, it's you."

00:34.876 --> 00:35.959
- Hi.

- With your gut.

00:45.083 --> 00:46.417
Oh, you were a boxer?

00:46.459 --> 00:47.876
- The name
- is Boomer,

00:47.918 --> 00:50.118

- I won...

00:51.083 --> 00:53.209
Forty-three fights.

00:53.459 --> 00:55.292

- I lost my 44th.

So, Emma,

07:06.083 --> 07:08.167
For the last time,

07:08.168 --> 07:10.250
you getting new bangs

07:06.083 --> 07:10.250
is not a fun surprise.

07:11.167 --> 07:13.125
- No, it's a new friend!
- This is Wendy.

07:13.167 --> 07:14.417
Hi, Zuri.

07:15.250 --> 07:16.647
We're going to have

07:16.648 --> 07:18.042
the bestest afternoon ever!

07:20.250 --> 07:22.083
- I'm not sure
- I can work with this.

07:23.375 --> 07:25.176
- Oh, you guys are
- going to get along great.

07:26.083 --> 07:27.563
And when you do,

07:27.564 --> 07:29.042
her dad's gonna get me

07:26.083 --> 07:29.042
a big audition.

07:29.083 --> 07:30.244
- Please...
- I'm begging you.

07:30.792 --> 07:32.042
(SIGHS) Oh, all right.

07:32.083 --> 07:33.334
I'll lay on the charm.

07:33.834 --> 07:34.834
Great!

07:35.083 --> 07:37.834
Okay, I will be right back.

07:37.876 --> 07:39.792
- I've got to go get
- Ravi an ice pack.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.000
He has P.E. tomorrow.

07:41.375 --> 07:42.751
Have fun!

07:42.792 --> 07:43.980
Bye, Jessie!

07:43.981 --> 07:45.167
We miss you already!

(ELEVATOR DINGS)

07:48.083 --> 07:49.250
Want to play dollies?

07:50.042 --> 07:51.375
This is Henrietta.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.522
Aw, she's pretty.

(POPPING)

07:55.250 --> 07:56.459
(SCREAMING)

07:58.083 --> 07:59.313
Hey! I don't know

07:59.314 --> 08:00.542
how they play dollies

08:00.584 --> 08:02.522
where you come from,

08:02.523 --> 08:04.459
but here that's

08:00.584 --> 08:04.459
a major party foul!

08:05.083 --> 08:07.042
Come on! Let's drop some

08:07.043 --> 08:09.000
heads off your terrace

08:05.083 --> 08:09.000
and watch people scatter!

08:10.375 --> 08:12.709
No! These girls have

08:12.710 --> 08:15.042
a very important pageant

08:10.375 --> 08:15.042
coming up next week,

08:15.083 --> 08:16.605
and the judges take

08:16.606 --> 08:18.125
off points for headlessness!

08:19.125 --> 08:21.042
Are we doing what I want?

08:21.083 --> 08:22.083
Or are we going

08:22.084 --> 08:23.084
to have a problem?

08:23.125 --> 08:25.000
Whoa, Mr. Hyde.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.083
Here at Zuri's house,

08:28.084 --> 08:30.083
the role of bad seed

08:26.083 --> 08:30.083
is already taken.

08:31.417 --> 08:32.876
- (GASPING)
- Tough.

08:33.082 --> 08:35.082
You're in my house now.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.082
(SCREAMING)

08:43.958 --> 08:45.167
You screamed?

08:46.125 --> 08:47.584
Wendy is decapitating

08:47.585 --> 08:49.042
my dollies!

08:49.083 --> 08:50.500
Oh, you can't do that.

08:50.542 --> 08:51.855
Those girls have a

08:51.856 --> 08:53.167
very important pageant

08:50.542 --> 08:53.167
coming up.

08:54.083 --> 08:55.522
You better shape up

08:55.523 --> 08:56.959
or we're going to

08:54.083 --> 08:56.959
tell Jessie.

08:57.500 --> 08:58.667
Or...

09:00.083 --> 09:01.542
I'll do what I want,

09:01.543 --> 09:03.000
and no one tells Jessie.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.813
Because if they do,

09:05.814 --> 09:08.000
I'll tell my daddy

09:03.626 --> 09:08.000
and he won't help her.

09:08.083 --> 09:11.042
Blackmail? Oh, you're good.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.563
If you weren't so scary,

09:13.564 --> 09:15.125
we'd probably be

09:12.000 --> 09:15.125
best friends!

09:16.083 --> 09:18.063
Well, she can't blackmail

09:18.064 --> 09:20.042
me because I don't care

09:16.083 --> 09:20.042
about Jessie's career.

09:20.083 --> 09:21.083
You know, without

09:21.084 --> 09:22.084
my Daddy's help,

09:22.125 --> 09:24.209
Jessie will probably be

09:24.210 --> 09:26.292
dragging you to her

09:22.125 --> 09:26.292
amateur plays for years.

09:27.626 --> 09:29.000
What do we have to do?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Wendy, get off

09:32.001 --> 09:33.001
the chandelier!

09:34.083 --> 09:35.126
WENDY: Doesn't anyone

09:35.127 --> 09:36.167
ever dust up here?

09:36.459 --> 09:38.334
- He doesn't even
- dust down here!

09:40.083 --> 09:41.584
- WENDY: Catch me!

09:45.292 --> 09:47.168
That was fun!

09:47.169 --> 09:49.042
Your tummy's like

09:45.292 --> 09:49.042
a trampoline!

(GRUNTING)

09:52.250 --> 09:53.584
Hi, I'm back!

09:54.125 --> 09:55.563
Hi! We're having

09:55.564 --> 09:57.000
so much fun, Jessie!

09:58.125 --> 09:59.750
Daddy! I had so much fun!

09:59.751 --> 10:01.375
Can I come back tomorrow?

10:01.417 --> 10:03.178
- Well, we'll have to see
- what Jessie says.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.167
- Although on a
- completely unrelated note,

10:05.209 --> 10:06.313
There's an audition

10:06.314 --> 10:07.417
for the Spielberg movie

10:05.209 --> 10:07.417
this Thursday.

10:07.459 --> 10:09.292
- Then on a
- completely related note,

10:09.334 --> 10:11.000
- Wendy's welcome any time!
- (CHUCKLES)

10:11.083 --> 10:12.334
- Bye, guys!
- See you tomorrow!

10:14.709 --> 10:16.000
Oh, no.

10:16.167 --> 10:17.250
We have to do this again?

10:18.083 --> 10:19.083
Being the good

10:19.084 --> 10:20.084
child is awful.

10:20.125 --> 10:21.147
I've got to go

10:21.148 --> 10:22.167
apologize to Ravi.

10:28.083 --> 10:29.417
Free samples!

10:29.459 --> 10:31.334
- But the toothpick
- is $1.50.

10:33.459 --> 10:35.000
- What do you
- think you're doing?

10:35.209 --> 10:37.000
- Giving people a
- healthy choice

10:37.042 --> 10:39.000
- At Ravi's Rockin' Roughage,
- LLC.

Millet puff?

10:41.209 --> 10:42.500
Probiotic pop?

10:42.542 --> 10:43.605
It tastes better

10:43.606 --> 10:44.667
than it sounds!

10:45.083 --> 10:46.563
I believe people

10:46.564 --> 10:48.042
will love my

10:45.083 --> 10:48.042
free samples,

10:48.083 --> 10:49.272
as they are both

10:49.273 --> 10:50.459
nutritious and delicious.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.292
Hey, that rhymed!

10:53.375 --> 10:54.709
Okay. If you want a battle,

10:54.710 --> 10:56.042
you'll get a battle.

10:56.083 --> 10:58.000
See? I can rhyme, too!

10:58.209 --> 10:59.626
Technically, saying

10:59.627 --> 11:01.042
the same word twice

10:58.209 --> 11:01.042
is not a rhyme.

11:01.292 --> 11:03.209
- Technically,
- fruit is not a hat.

11:09.125 --> 11:11.000

11:12.083 --> 11:13.313
Hey, Zuri! You excited

11:13.314 --> 11:14.542
for your play date

11:12.083 --> 11:14.542
with Wendy?

11:15.083 --> 11:17.292
Ugh, I totally was,

11:17.293 --> 11:19.500
but now I think I'm coming

11:15.083 --> 11:19.500
down with something.

11:19.542 --> 11:21.396
I feel all hot,

11:21.397 --> 11:23.250
and my nose is runny...

(SNIFFLING)

And, uh,

11:24.647 --> 11:26.000
my toes are shrinking.

11:27.209 --> 11:30.626
Your toes are shrinking?

11:32.500 --> 11:33.876
Yeah...

11:33.877 --> 11:35.250
Is that not a thing?

11:42.542 --> 11:44.500
Okay, I get it.

11:45.083 --> 11:46.605
You don't want to hang out

11:46.606 --> 11:48.125
with Wendy because you

11:45.083 --> 11:48.125
think she's too boring.

11:48.167 --> 11:50.209
It's okay.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.001
I'm sure I can get an

11:52.002 --> 11:53.751
audition for a Spielberg

11:50.250 --> 11:53.751
movie some other way.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.272
Really?

11:55.273 --> 11:56.459
Sure.

11:56.500 --> 11:57.564
There's always a chance

11:57.565 --> 11:58.626
I'll run into Steve

11:56.500 --> 11:58.626
on the street

11:58.667 --> 12:00.626
- and get to do my
- E.T. impression.

12:01.918 --> 12:03.209
Okay, I'll hang out

12:03.210 --> 12:04.500
with Wendy.

12:04.542 --> 12:06.064
You will?

12:06.065 --> 12:07.584
Oh, thank you.

12:08.417 --> 12:09.709
Sure. Your E.T. impression

12:09.710 --> 12:11.000
is horrible.

12:12.250 --> 12:13.626
You really think so?

12:14.083 --> 12:15.626
(IMITATING E.T.) Be good.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.000
Yeah, now I hear it.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.355
Wow, Ravi,

12:25.356 --> 12:27.209
people really love

12:23.500 --> 12:27.209
your food!

12:27.250 --> 12:28.459
I know! I may have

12:28.460 --> 12:29.667
to use Mr. Daddy's

12:29.709 --> 12:31.231
shell company

12:31.232 --> 12:32.751
in the Caymans to hide

12:29.709 --> 12:32.751
some of this skrilla!

12:35.792 --> 12:37.272
I can't believe your

12:37.273 --> 12:38.751
brother's cart stole

12:35.792 --> 12:38.751
all our customers.

12:39.209 --> 12:41.329
- Well, then who ordered - these green eggs
- And ham?

12:41.375 --> 12:42.688
That's a plate you were

12:42.689 --> 12:44.000
supposed to clear

12:41.375 --> 12:44.000
days ago.

12:44.792 --> 12:46.125
I'm sorry, Boomer.

12:46.167 --> 12:47.209
Hmm. Not as

12:47.210 --> 12:48.250
sorry as I am.

12:48.292 --> 12:50.209
Because business

12:50.210 --> 12:52.125
is so bad,

12:48.292 --> 12:52.125
I have to let you go.

12:52.542 --> 12:53.980
What? But I was

12:53.981 --> 12:55.417
learning so much!

12:55.459 --> 12:56.855
I'd never even seen

12:56.856 --> 12:58.250
a nickel before

12:55.459 --> 12:58.250
I came here!

12:58.292 --> 13:00.168
I thought it was just some

13:00.169 --> 13:02.042
old-timey word, like

12:58.292 --> 13:02.042
"tuppence" or "landline!"

13:02.918 --> 13:04.375
I'm really gonna miss you,

13:04.417 --> 13:06.022
and the way you tried

13:06.023 --> 13:07.626
to clean tomatoes in

13:04.417 --> 13:07.626
the dishwasher.

13:07.667 --> 13:08.876
- But...
- Sorry, Emma,

13:08.918 --> 13:10.268
- But your brother's got me
- against the ropes,

13:10.292 --> 13:12.167
- Sucker-punched me
- in the wallet,

13:12.209 --> 13:13.272
And now I'm going

13:13.273 --> 13:14.334
down for the count.

13:14.584 --> 13:16.209
- Now I'm sad and confused.
- (SIGHS)

13:18.626 --> 13:20.313
So, the rules of

13:20.314 --> 13:22.000
No-Lose Dodgeball are

13:22.584 --> 13:23.917
you don't move,

13:23.918 --> 13:25.250
so I never lose.

13:26.834 --> 13:28.085
Are you sure

13:28.086 --> 13:29.334
you don't want to

13:26.834 --> 13:29.334
play checkers?

13:29.375 --> 13:31.000
Nope!

13:31.751 --> 13:32.751
Ready...

13:33.584 --> 13:34.626
Aim...

13:34.876 --> 13:35.918
Fire!

13:35.959 --> 13:37.000
(SHRIEKING)

13:39.334 --> 13:41.209
Oh, no! That vase was

13:41.210 --> 13:43.083
a priceless antique!

13:43.125 --> 13:44.292
Zuri, what did you do?

13:44.334 --> 13:45.522
Um, it wasn't

13:45.523 --> 13:46.709
Zuri's fault.

13:47.250 --> 13:48.250
Thanks, Wendy.

13:50.083 --> 13:52.059
- She was just trying to - prove that she
could do - A better cartwheel than me.

13:52.083 --> 13:53.105
She didn't mean

13:53.106 --> 13:54.125
to fall into the vase.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.167
Say what?

13:56.334 --> 13:57.542
Don't feel bad, Zuri.

13:57.584 --> 13:58.626
Lots of kids

13:58.627 --> 13:59.667
can't cartwheel.

14:00.083 --> 14:02.688
I took three years of

14:02.689 --> 14:05.292
Tumbling Tot Gymnastics,

14:00.083 --> 14:05.292
woman!

14:05.334 --> 14:06.959
- I'll show you
- a cartwheel!

14:07.000 --> 14:08.334
No, no, no.

14:09.417 --> 14:10.751
I'm so sorry, Wendy.

14:10.792 --> 14:11.814
Can you just excuse

14:11.815 --> 14:12.834
us for a minute?

14:15.626 --> 14:17.230
Zuri, you know how

14:17.231 --> 14:18.834
important this is for me.

14:18.876 --> 14:20.084
For once, can't you

14:20.085 --> 14:21.292
just think of someone

14:18.876 --> 14:21.292
besides yourself?

14:21.334 --> 14:22.751
But Wendy is horrible!

14:22.752 --> 14:24.167
She's a monster!

14:26.584 --> 14:28.000
She is not.

14:28.042 --> 14:29.626
- And I'm really
- disappointed in you.

14:30.125 --> 14:31.459
Now, be nice.

14:32.125 --> 14:33.886
- Now I have to go get
- a whole lot of glue.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.522
If you want your nanny

14:38.523 --> 14:41.334
to get that audition,

14:35.709 --> 14:41.334
you'll keep your mouth shut.

14:41.751 --> 14:43.126
You are very lucky

14:43.127 --> 14:44.500
I love Jessie.

14:44.542 --> 14:45.834
Also, that I already

14:45.835 --> 14:47.125
broke that vase

14:44.542 --> 14:47.125
months ago

14:47.167 --> 14:48.438
and secretly replaced

14:48.439 --> 14:49.709
it with a fake.

14:50.542 --> 14:51.584
Respect.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.167
Thank you.

14:53.209 --> 14:54.480
Now which finger

14:54.481 --> 14:55.751
is your least favorite?

15:00.959 --> 15:02.439
Okay, who's ready

15:02.440 --> 15:03.918
to play Matterhorn?

15:04.209 --> 15:05.376
Not us! Not us!

15:05.377 --> 15:06.542
Not us! Not us!

15:08.250 --> 15:09.250
Make sure to

15:09.251 --> 15:10.251
lean into that turn!

15:11.334 --> 15:12.355
Guys, do you think

15:12.356 --> 15:13.375
this audition would be

15:11.334 --> 15:13.375
more memorable

15:13.417 --> 15:14.647
if I did the whole thing

15:14.648 --> 15:15.876
in a Grover voice?

15:16.626 --> 15:18.001
Well, it's better than

15:18.002 --> 15:19.375
your E.T. voice.

15:21.167 --> 15:22.959
- Wendy? Why are
- Zuri and Bertram

15:23.000 --> 15:24.959
- About to wet my new
- pillow-top mattress?

15:25.834 --> 15:27.459
Because they're crybabies.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.167
Especially the big one.

15:30.918 --> 15:32.459
Wendy, don't be rude!

15:32.500 --> 15:33.876
- You're such a
- nice little girl!

15:33.918 --> 15:34.959
No, she isn't!

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
She's a terror!

15:37.751 --> 15:38.981
Not only does she blame

15:38.982 --> 15:40.209
everything on Zuri,

15:40.250 --> 15:41.313
she cut

15:41.314 --> 15:42.375
my suspenders.

15:42.417 --> 15:44.230
Now when I try to run away,

15:44.231 --> 15:46.042
my pants fall down!

15:46.083 --> 15:48.292
It's true, I've seen it!

15:48.334 --> 15:49.730
It's the only thing

15:49.731 --> 15:51.125
scarier than Wendy!

15:53.959 --> 15:55.230
You just wait until

15:55.231 --> 15:56.500
your father hears

15:53.959 --> 15:56.500
about this!

15:56.542 --> 15:57.731
My daddy is a

15:57.732 --> 15:58.918
very busy guy.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.105
All he cares about is

16:01.106 --> 16:03.250
finally finding someone

15:58.959 --> 16:03.250
willing to take care of me.

16:03.292 --> 16:05.167
- And if you're not
- that person,

16:05.209 --> 16:06.813
Do you think you'll still

16:06.814 --> 16:08.417
get that audition?

16:08.459 --> 16:10.480
So you really think you

16:10.481 --> 16:12.500
can buy my silence,

16:08.459 --> 16:12.500
just by threatening my career?

16:14.334 --> 16:16.292
One... Two...

16:16.334 --> 16:17.438
Can you at least angle

16:17.439 --> 16:18.542
us away from the fireplace?

16:18.584 --> 16:19.792
Nope.

16:23.834 --> 16:25.667
Weird, right?

16:25.668 --> 16:27.500
Vegetables can

16:23.834 --> 16:27.500
taste good!

16:27.542 --> 16:28.896
(CHUCKLES) I mean,

16:28.897 --> 16:30.250
I don't want to sound crazy,

16:30.292 --> 16:32.271
but it almost makes me think

16:32.272 --> 16:34.250
I should listen to my nanny

16:30.292 --> 16:34.250
about other things too.

16:37.667 --> 16:38.667
Luke, cover for me.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.439
And please do not use

16:41.440 --> 16:42.751
the probiotic pops

16:40.125 --> 16:42.751
as walrus tusks.

16:46.083 --> 16:47.209
Okay.

16:49.334 --> 16:50.855
Emma, why have you gone

16:50.856 --> 16:52.375
from glam to glum?

16:53.459 --> 16:54.647
Because your stupid

16:54.648 --> 16:55.834
cart got me fired!

16:55.876 --> 16:58.042
It did? Oh, dear.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.272
That was never a part of our

17:00.273 --> 17:02.459
mission statement at

16:58.083 --> 17:02.459
Ravi's Rockin' Roughage, LLC.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Just leave me alone.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.167
I need to do that thing

17:08.169 --> 17:09.959
that other girls do.

17:06.375 --> 17:09.959
What's it called?

17:10.834 --> 17:12.041
"Be upset that things

17:12.042 --> 17:13.250
didn't go my way."

17:14.459 --> 17:16.084
On the bright side,

17:16.085 --> 17:17.709
you hated working, right?

17:18.334 --> 17:20.188
Actually, I was kind of

17:20.189 --> 17:22.041
proud to earn my own

17:18.334 --> 17:22.041
money for a change.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.188
But now it's all over,

17:23.189 --> 17:24.291
thanks to you.

17:24.334 --> 17:26.041
Emma, I am truly sorry.

17:26.083 --> 17:28.083
So am I.

17:28.125 --> 17:29.584
Now, instead of working,

17:29.585 --> 17:31.042
I'll just have to spend all

17:28.125 --> 17:31.042
my afternoons at the spa.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.083
I hope you're happy!

17:33.834 --> 17:35.542
- Would it put things
- in perspective

17:35.584 --> 17:37.272
If I told you I spend

17:37.273 --> 17:38.959
my afternoons

17:35.584 --> 17:38.959
hiding from the debate team?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.460
They do not punch,

17:40.461 --> 17:41.918
but their comments are

17:39.000 --> 17:41.918
very hurtful.

17:45.417 --> 17:46.709
Come out, come out,

17:46.710 --> 17:48.000
wherever you are.

17:50.083 --> 17:51.751
I'm so scared.

17:53.083 --> 17:54.310
- You guys should
- save yourselves.

17:54.334 --> 17:55.751
- It's my audition.
- It's my fight.

17:56.042 --> 17:57.042
No, we're in

17:57.043 --> 17:58.043
this together.

17:58.083 --> 18:00.022
If you have to play

18:00.023 --> 18:01.959
Starving Games, we have to

17:58.083 --> 18:01.959
play Starving Games.

18:02.083 --> 18:03.500
Right, Bertram?

18:03.542 --> 18:05.000
I'm so hungry.

18:06.083 --> 18:07.542
Duh. It's not called

18:07.543 --> 18:09.000
the "No Thanks,

18:06.083 --> 18:09.000
I'm Stuffed" Games.

18:09.751 --> 18:10.897
Wendy set up

18:10.898 --> 18:12.042
an entire feast

18:09.751 --> 18:12.042
in the kitchen.

18:12.083 --> 18:13.459
I think I can make it.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.189
No! That's exactly

18:15.190 --> 18:16.876
what she wants!

18:16.918 --> 18:19.042
Anybody up for some brie?

18:19.083 --> 18:21.459
It's extra runny.

18:22.083 --> 18:23.042
Oh!

18:23.083 --> 18:25.000
Extra runny brie.

18:26.375 --> 18:27.375
If I get hit,

18:27.709 --> 18:29.667
- will you tell Ravi
- he was my favorite?

Marty, I'm gonna

19:04.543 --> 19:06.000
have to call you back.

19:07.125 --> 19:09.000
- Nobody's guarding
- the brie!

19:11.083 --> 19:12.751
Daddy, Zuri's throwing

19:12.752 --> 19:14.417
water balloons at me!

19:14.459 --> 19:15.584
That's terrible.

19:15.834 --> 19:17.792
- Zuri, you apologize to
- Wendy right now!

19:18.083 --> 19:19.334
But I didn't...

19:20.500 --> 19:22.043
Oh, okay. Wendy,

19:22.044 --> 19:23.584
I'm very, very...

19:23.626 --> 19:25.083
Okay, that's it.

19:25.125 --> 19:27.084
James, it's Wendy who

19:27.085 --> 19:29.042
should be apologizing

19:25.125 --> 19:29.042
to Zuri.

19:29.083 --> 19:30.542
Because frankly,

19:30.543 --> 19:32.000
your daughter is a

19:29.083 --> 19:32.000
gigantic brat!

19:32.042 --> 19:34.000
- How dare you!
- My daughter is an angel!

19:34.167 --> 19:35.584
Your angel has a seven-foot

19:35.585 --> 19:37.000
poisonous lizard

19:34.167 --> 19:37.000
afraid of her.

19:38.667 --> 19:39.855
And she tried to

19:39.856 --> 19:41.042
bowl with my

19:38.667 --> 19:41.042
doll's heads!

19:41.083 --> 19:42.522
Using the bodies

19:42.523 --> 19:43.959
as bowling pins!

19:44.000 --> 19:45.250
If I were you, I'd sleep

19:45.251 --> 19:46.500
with one eye open!

19:47.918 --> 19:48.980
They're lying!

19:48.981 --> 19:50.042

20:03.000 --> 20:04.685
- you're famous for
- recognizing great actresses,

20:04.709 --> 20:06.272
But you've totally missed

20:06.273 --> 20:07.834
that the best one

20:04.709 --> 20:07.834
is your daughter.

- I think I know - why she might be
- Acting out.

20:12.167 --> 20:13.646
Is it because

20:13.647 --> 20:15.125
I didn't get you that bike

20:12.167 --> 20:15.125

she needs your attention!

Forgive me,

20:26.377 --> 20:28.042
but you seem a little

20:24.709 --> 20:28.042
preoccupied with work.

- Is it possible you spend - more

And right now,

20:38.084 --> 20:40.083
your daughter needs you

20:36.083 --> 20:40.083
more than I need an audition.

- on the phone.

when I tied that

or formed an army

20:51.584 --> 20:53.792
do my bidding.

22:16.834 --> 22:17.939
Absolutely! I need my

22:17.940 --> 22:19.042
number one grill girl.

22:19.083 --> 22:20.727
- You got a lot to learn,
- but you make me laugh.

22:20.751 --> 22:22.000
Sometimes on purpose.

22:24.167 --> 22:25.167
Wait just one second.

22:27.667 --> 22:29.042
Guys,

22:29.083 --> 22:31.268
- I can't believe you shut
- down Ravi's Rockin' Roughage,

22:31.292 --> 22:33.709
LLC, just for me.

22:34.959 --> 22:36.709
Me neither.

22:36.751 --> 22:37.959
We were just one batch

22:37.960 --> 22:39.167
of flaxseed chips away

22:36.751 --> 22:39.167
from a ski weekend!

22:40.375 --> 22:41.876
Ravi, thank you.

22:41.918 --> 22:43.980
Do not mention it.

22:43.981 --> 22:46.042
I would do anything for you.

22:41.918 --> 22:46.042
You are my sister.

22:46.375 --> 22:49.626
Oh! Well, back to work.

22:52.125 --> 22:53.396
She seems happy,

22:53.397 --> 22:54.667
does she not?

22:54.709 --> 22:56.059
- Are you going to tell her
- we got shut down

22:56.083 --> 22:58.044
- Because we didn't have - a vendor permit?
- Shh.

22:58.083 --> 23:00.000
- Do not ruin
- the moment.
