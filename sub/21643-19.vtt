WEBVTT

00:09.175 --> 00:12.045
Carter, I'm really glad
you decided to talk to somebody.

00:12.545 --> 00:14.748
So, tell me what's been going on.

00:16.583 --> 00:17.450
Uh...

00:19.000 --> 00:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:57.690 --> 00:58.558
Not much.

01:17.544 --> 01:18.411
Mom?

01:20.146 --> 01:21.081
Who's there?

01:21.748 --> 01:23.583
The person who calls you "Mom."

01:26.619 --> 01:28.354
All right, your story checks out.

01:29.856 --> 01:31.224
What are you doing?

01:31.758 --> 01:32.659
If you were me,

01:32.725 --> 01:36.729
where would you hide this cash
so nobody could find it except future me?

01:36.796 --> 01:38.865
And keep in mind,
future me will be stoned.

01:39.566 --> 01:40.800
What about the safe?

01:40.867 --> 01:45.638
Oh-ho. The safe is full of Snapple.

01:47.207 --> 01:48.308
Sweet stash.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.876
You've even got Peach Mangosteen?

01:50.143 --> 01:52.312
Oh, yeah. Me and the mangosteens
go way back.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.549
Well, where do you usually put your money?
The secret safe?

01:56.616 --> 01:57.817
Yeah--

01:58.351 --> 02:00.620
Who told you about the secret safe?

02:00.687 --> 02:03.189
Mom. You overshare when you're high.

02:03.857 --> 02:07.360
Listen, I know banks aren't an option
for people in the marijuana industry,

02:07.427 --> 02:10.430
but there's gotta be something better
than hiding cash all over your office.

02:10.497 --> 02:14.434
Look, you know, you may have a master's
in business administration,

02:14.501 --> 02:18.138
but I happen to have a PhD
in making it rain.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.276
Okay. Okay, that was pretty cool.

02:23.343 --> 02:27.280
But, Mom, I'm gonna explore
some other cash management options.

02:27.347 --> 02:29.449
Maybe you should diversify a little bit.

02:29.516 --> 02:30.884
I am diversified.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.318
Come on, what do you want?

02:32.385 --> 02:36.689
I got, uh, euros, pesos, gold coins.

02:37.423 --> 02:40.793
And my Beanie Babies!

02:49.235 --> 02:51.437
That's very interesting, Sadie.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.339
Tell me more about photosynthesis.

02:53.940 --> 02:56.609
Well... it tickles.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.479
-Yeah, it totally does.
-Yeah.

02:59.546 --> 03:02.248
Oh, God. That's adorable.

03:03.249 --> 03:05.318
Hey, Pete. Still batshit crazy, huh?

03:06.886 --> 03:08.288
Is that Jenny?

03:08.354 --> 03:10.323
Can you ask her for more tea?

03:10.690 --> 03:13.526
Jenny, the girls are asking
about your tea again.

03:13.593 --> 03:16.696
Yeah, well tell the girls
they aren't getting any tea.

03:16.763 --> 03:20.266
Because I get it from my mom and
my mom hasn't spoken to me for weeks.

03:21.901 --> 03:24.704
I can't imagine not talking to my girls
for that long.

03:26.940 --> 03:27.874
Really?

03:27.941 --> 03:30.376
What're you gonna do
after you cut them, hang them

03:30.443 --> 03:31.878
and sell them to strangers to get high?

03:32.645 --> 03:36.816
-Who's gonna get cut down?
-No one, Coco. No one.

03:38.985 --> 03:43.256
Jenny was telling me about another group
of marijuana plants that got cut down

03:43.323 --> 03:44.824
in, uh, Canada.

03:46.659 --> 03:48.561
Ah. Sounds plausible.

03:49.529 --> 03:51.698
Pete, you're really worrying me.

03:51.764 --> 03:52.732
You know it's time.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.334
They're ready to be harvested.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.768
Harvested?

03:56.336 --> 03:58.404
Pay her no mind, she lies to her mother.

04:02.308 --> 04:05.878
Hey, what I tell my parents
is none of their business.

04:07.847 --> 04:10.984
You'd never harvest us,
would you, Daddy?

04:11.918 --> 04:13.353
Of course-- Of course not.

04:13.553 --> 04:14.420
We're family.

04:14.487 --> 04:16.689
Oh, yay!

04:29.469 --> 04:30.903
-Hey, Carter.
-Hey.

04:31.437 --> 04:32.438
What do you got there?

04:32.505 --> 04:35.341
These are my nana's fudge swirls.

04:41.714 --> 04:42.915
They look like shit.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.653
No. What do you mean?
They're delicious.

04:46.719 --> 04:48.021
Yeah, yeah, maybe, but, um--

04:48.288 --> 04:51.424
But they look like actual piles of poop.

04:52.892 --> 04:54.460
No they-- No, they don't.

04:54.527 --> 04:56.929
Hey, Travis, come check out
Olivia's nana's shitballs.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.700
They're not shitballs,
they're fudge swirls.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.636
-They look like shit.
-Right?

05:05.672 --> 05:08.074
-They don't smell like shit.
-Because they're not shit.

05:10.376 --> 05:12.011
Oh, my God.
Your nana's shitballs are amazing.

05:12.078 --> 05:12.979
Wow! Wow!

05:13.746 --> 05:16.616
-But please stop calling them that.
-Y'all talking shitballs?

05:16.683 --> 05:17.884
Oh!

05:17.950 --> 05:19.886
-Ha-ha-ha. Count us in.
-Oh, yeah.

05:19.952 --> 05:22.088
-Count us all the way in.
-They're fudge swirls.

05:22.355 --> 05:23.723
And, yes, you may have some.

05:23.790 --> 05:26.392
Goodness gracious,
these are great balls of shit!

05:28.094 --> 05:31.898
Yeah, I'm getting a subtle hint
of Madagascar single bean chocolate.

05:31.964 --> 05:35.335
Yeah, with some cardamom and nutmeg.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.804
-Toasted nutmeg.
-Yeah, you gotta toast that shit.

05:37.870 --> 05:40.073
That's amazing.
How did you guys know that?

05:40.339 --> 05:43.876
Well, Olivia,
this is not our first shitball.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.081
But wait, what's that, um...

05:48.347 --> 05:50.917
What's that thing I'm not tasting
on the back of my palate?

05:52.685 --> 05:55.588
You're right.
There's a strong absence of something.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.524
Well, there's no pot in them.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.594
Motherfucker!

06:06.099 --> 06:08.067
-You have to warn a person.
-Yeah.

06:08.134 --> 06:11.003
Man, what if this
was a children's birthday party?

06:11.070 --> 06:14.941
And I ate three of them. And
the next thing you know, I'm not high!

06:17.610 --> 06:19.746
You guys, I am-- I am so sorry.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.015
"Sorry" doesn't get me stoned, does it?

06:23.082 --> 06:25.051
-Does it? It doesn't!
-No.

06:25.118 --> 06:28.554
-They called "baked goods" for a reason!
-Yeah!

06:28.855 --> 06:30.423
Because they're good!

06:30.490 --> 06:31.724
Think of the children!

06:32.725 --> 06:34.560
-Why did we come here?
-I don't know!

06:40.433 --> 06:43.870
Well, you know, I bet if we put weed
in these, we could sell them.

06:43.936 --> 06:45.772
Yeah, they already have a catchy name.

06:46.873 --> 06:48.007
Nana's Fudge Swirls?

06:50.676 --> 06:52.612
I think we're gonna stick with Shitballs.

07:30.783 --> 07:31.684
Daddy.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.189
Shh! Go back to sleep.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.658
What are you holding?

07:40.860 --> 07:42.595
Oh. These?

07:43.896 --> 07:47.133
These are my love scissors.

07:48.167 --> 07:51.671
Oh! Are we getting our first haircut?

07:51.737 --> 07:53.005
Yay! Haircut.

07:53.072 --> 07:54.106
I want bangs.

07:54.173 --> 07:55.475
Katy Perry bangs.

07:55.541 --> 07:56.676
I want a bob.

07:56.742 --> 07:59.011
Oh, God, I'm a monster!

08:03.549 --> 08:05.485
Ho, ho, ho!

08:05.551 --> 08:07.753
"Merry-juana," one and all!

08:07.820 --> 08:12.792
Welcome to Dank and Dabby's "Every Day
is Christmas Christmas Spectacular."

08:12.859 --> 08:17.263
Yeah. Because every day is Christmas
when you're high in a parking lot.

08:18.264 --> 08:20.266
We're in front of Ruth's
Alternative Caring.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.802
And look at all the fans
that came to see us today.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.205
-Thanks for showing up, guys.
-Yeah.

08:26.272 --> 08:29.175
Man, they're all excited and energetic,
moving around,

08:29.242 --> 08:31.143
it's like they're trying too damn hard.

08:31.210 --> 08:32.778
-Oh, yeah.
-You know?

08:32.845 --> 08:35.715
Yeah, the real fans are you guys at home

08:35.780 --> 08:38.150
who are too stoned
to come down and see us.

08:38.217 --> 08:42.054
Hell yeah, matter of fact, the realest fan
would be too stoned to even watch this.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.924
So, if you're watching right now,
fuck you, lightweight.

08:44.991 --> 08:47.627
-Yeah, fuck you!
-Fuck you right in the face!

08:48.528 --> 08:50.630
-I'm so hot.
-Oh, I'm so hot, too.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.966
-We can't! Not now.
-We cannot do this now.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.201
-Oh, shit!
-What?

08:55.268 --> 08:58.237
Travis gave us a list of, like, stuff
we're supposed to mention.

08:58.304 --> 09:00.039
-Right. List. List. Listerine.
-Okay.

09:00.106 --> 09:02.241
Listerine, antiseptic tank you very much.

09:03.910 --> 09:05.645
Ha! Got it.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.046
-You're so smart.
-All right.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.849
"Mention high quality products."

09:09.916 --> 09:12.985
-We could find a spot to squeeze that in.
-Yeah.

09:14.253 --> 09:15.988
"Address and phone number."

09:16.055 --> 09:18.224
Oh! Ruth has both of those.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.559
So Google that.

09:20.726 --> 09:24.196
Uh, "Don't get too crazy,
i.e., smoking in parking lot."

09:24.830 --> 09:26.766
You think I.E. stands for something?

09:27.133 --> 09:28.801
I think, "Make sure to"?

09:28.868 --> 09:30.670
Mmm... Nailed it!

09:30.937 --> 09:31.904
Yeah, we did.

09:31.971 --> 09:34.640
And now it's time for Santa Dank
and Dabby Claus

09:34.707 --> 09:36.943
to give out joints
to all the good boys and girls.

09:37.009 --> 09:38.077
-Yeah.
-Follow us.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.246
Ho, ho, ho!

09:40.313 --> 09:43.049
-Hey, there you go, little boy.
-Free weed?

09:43.115 --> 09:45.851
Looks like I picked the right day
to sneak out of rehab.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.053
Yeah!

09:47.720 --> 09:51.924
Jesus Bruce Lee Christ,
what the hell is going on here, huh?

09:51.991 --> 09:53.626
Hello, angry karate girl.

09:53.693 --> 09:57.730
Welcome to Dank and Dabby's Christmas
is Christmas is Christmas Spectacular.

09:57.797 --> 09:58.931
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

09:58.998 --> 10:02.868
-Would you like to sit on our laps?
-I'd like to sit on your faces.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.137
Wow. Slow down, dude.

10:05.671 --> 10:06.639
We'll get there.

10:07.673 --> 10:12.345
What did I tell you about snurfing blounts
and dropping spliefers in the parking lot?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.180
-Uh... To.
-Yeah.

10:14.246 --> 10:15.915
No! Not to!

10:15.982 --> 10:17.783
-I always forget the "not".
-Yeah.

10:18.017 --> 10:22.188
You two hemped-out burn pots
have made two very big mistakes.

10:22.254 --> 10:23.789
Sonny and Cher.

10:23.856 --> 10:25.725
-Oh, I love them.
-No drugs. No drugs.

10:25.891 --> 10:26.759
-Dude!
-No!

10:26.826 --> 10:28.894
-Yeah.
-Not cool, Fuck Norris.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.630
-Get him, Dabs!
-Turn that camera--

10:30.696 --> 10:31.664
-Yeah!
-Oh shit!

10:32.898 --> 10:35.768
Who's sitting on whose face now?

10:42.408 --> 10:43.776
Okay, as promised,

10:44.844 --> 10:47.947
I've been looking into some creative ways
for us to store our money.

10:48.014 --> 10:49.815
Are we gonna bury it in a cemetery?

10:52.718 --> 10:54.020
What are we, pirates?

10:55.821 --> 10:57.890
-Uh, well...
-Are you open to it?

10:57.957 --> 11:00.726
-Because now I really wanna be a pirate.
-Okay, Mom.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.729
Okay, just-- Just hear me out here.
We're not burying anything.

11:03.796 --> 11:07.400
What I wanna do is buy cemetery plots
with our cash.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.137
Then, any time we want,
we can sell it back for the same price.

11:11.203 --> 11:13.272
It's a completely liquid asset.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.976
I talked to the guys here. There's plenty
of plots available to purchase.

11:17.043 --> 11:19.011
You just have to tell them
you're Armenian.

11:21.180 --> 11:24.050
Well, I guess I could be
Ruth Whitefeather Feldmounian.

11:25.951 --> 11:26.952
So, what do you think?

11:27.753 --> 11:32.691
Travis, not only is this a good idea,
it's a fucking cool idea.

11:33.359 --> 11:36.195
Well, thank you. You know,
that means a lot coming from you.

11:36.262 --> 11:37.763
-Oh, come on.
-No, I'm serious.

11:37.830 --> 11:40.299
Mom, you worked really hard
your entire life.

11:40.933 --> 11:43.836
All right? It's important for me to know
that you're protected.

11:44.837 --> 11:45.771
Thanks.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.208
Look at all these people buried here.

11:49.909 --> 11:51.977
I mean, I just can't help wondering,
I mean...

11:52.912 --> 11:55.114
Did they live the life they imagined?

11:55.181 --> 11:57.249
Will they be remembered for anything?

11:57.316 --> 12:01.220
Did they proudly serve the Armenian
community of greater Los Angeles?

12:02.455 --> 12:04.023
Where are you going with this?

12:04.090 --> 12:07.460
I don't know. I'm an old person
in a cemetery. I'm kind of freaked out.

12:08.127 --> 12:09.495
Come on, let's get out of here.

12:12.031 --> 12:13.032
Look at that one.

12:13.099 --> 12:14.767
Birth date, no death date.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.435
You know what that means?

12:18.170 --> 12:20.039
That guy was buried alive.

12:22.508 --> 12:23.742
Come on, Mom.

12:24.977 --> 12:27.446
Hello.

12:34.153 --> 12:37.056
I know we call Dank and Dabby
fucksticks, like, a lot,

12:38.124 --> 12:39.825
but it really is the right word.

12:39.892 --> 12:43.229
Yeah, they really are
Lord and Lady Fuckstick.

12:45.197 --> 12:46.365
Oh, please be my mom.

12:47.333 --> 12:50.136
Ugh! It's just that same
stupid Amber Alert.

12:50.202 --> 12:55.007
Yes, silver Corolla, child abduction,
immediate danger, we get it.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.444
So, you still haven't heard
from your mom?

13:00.146 --> 13:01.380
I don't wanna talk about it.

13:03.082 --> 13:04.083
Let's talk about you.

13:05.251 --> 13:06.519
I don't wanna talk about me.

13:08.554 --> 13:10.890
Let's talk some more shit
about Dank and Dabby.

13:11.157 --> 13:12.424
Yeah.

13:13.159 --> 13:14.093
"I'm Dabby.

13:14.160 --> 13:19.031
I smoke a shit ton of weed
and I scream for no reason!"

13:19.865 --> 13:22.868
That's her, that's her. Okay,
here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

13:22.935 --> 13:27.506
"Dank, dick, dickhead,
douche bag, jackass,

13:27.573 --> 13:32.545
jerk off, moron, more on that later."

13:34.547 --> 13:37.116
"Somehow I find that attractive,
make out with me!"

13:37.183 --> 13:38.150
"Yes, I will."

13:46.592 --> 13:48.994
-They dumb.
-Yeah, so stupid.

13:50.062 --> 13:52.998
-I'm gonna get back to this trash.
-I'm gonna kick this around.

13:57.970 --> 14:00.206
Where are we going, Daddy?

14:01.173 --> 14:02.074
A forest

14:02.441 --> 14:07.146
where you can be safe
and be with your own kind and run free.

14:07.213 --> 14:09.848
Well, stand still free.

14:11.617 --> 14:14.019
Someplace where I won't have to kill you.

14:14.486 --> 14:15.621
"Kill you?"

14:16.288 --> 14:20.059
Uh, no. No, I said "krill you."

14:21.093 --> 14:26.332
You know, make you talk to the
microscopic plankton that whales eat.

14:28.467 --> 14:29.468
Jesus.

14:30.603 --> 14:33.339
Slow down, you stupid silver Corolla.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.643
To think he'd drive like that
with his daughter in the back.

14:38.310 --> 14:40.613
Yes. Hey, hi, little girl. I see you.

14:49.021 --> 14:53.092
When the tornado hit,
it was pretty devastating.

14:53.158 --> 14:55.961
Everything we had was gone.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.097
Even with our insurance,

14:58.163 --> 15:02.067
we knew it would take a while
to get life back to normal.

15:02.601 --> 15:06.438
Well, we were anxious and scared.

15:07.139 --> 15:09.241
We needed to get high.

15:12.278 --> 15:15.180
Within a few hours,
Pot Farmers was here

15:15.247 --> 15:19.318
with two weeks' worth
of emergency joints, lighters and bongs.

15:20.219 --> 15:21.687
No questions asked.

15:21.954 --> 15:26.292
-And, like, good weed.
-Oh, yeah. Primo.

15:26.358 --> 15:27.993
Not that trim shit.

15:28.294 --> 15:31.163
Thank you so much. Thank you.

15:31.230 --> 15:35.401
It was really reassuring
to suddenly understand

15:35.467 --> 15:41.607
that what happened to us was an
infinitesimal ripple in the ocean of time.

15:41.674 --> 15:44.076
Plus, I got my appetite back.

15:55.087 --> 15:56.488
It's so funny.

15:56.555 --> 16:00.059
-I don't know what the future holds.
-Nobody does.

16:00.125 --> 16:07.132
But it's nice to know
we don't have to face it fully.

16:10.569 --> 16:12.037
Where are the kids?

16:28.587 --> 16:30.322
-What?
-Nothing.

16:35.561 --> 16:38.397
All right, what clown
put a box of turds on my desk?

16:43.202 --> 16:44.636
Those are my nana's fudge swirls.

16:44.703 --> 16:47.740
I'm trying to talk Olivia into making them
with weed so we can sell them here.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.709
Ooh. Another good idea, Travis.
You're on a roll.

16:50.776 --> 16:54.313
And "Nana's Fudge Swirls,"
what a homey name.

16:55.547 --> 16:56.615
Thank you!

16:56.682 --> 16:58.784
They wanna call them "Shitballs."

17:00.753 --> 17:02.021
Well, that's better.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.089
Stoners love a good shit joke.

17:05.557 --> 17:08.127
Okay, no, I need to make
a stand here, guys.

17:08.193 --> 17:11.463
My grandmother was the sole bright spot
in an otherwise miserable childhood, okay?

17:11.530 --> 17:14.032
We are not selling "Nana's Shitballs."

17:15.567 --> 17:17.336
How about "Olivia's Shitballs"?

17:18.704 --> 17:20.406
Can my picture be on the package?

17:21.607 --> 17:22.508
Ruth.

17:23.541 --> 17:24.609
Howdy, neighbor.

17:24.675 --> 17:27.813
How's it's Tae Kwon Do-ing?

17:39.191 --> 17:41.460
I thought we came to an understanding.

17:41.527 --> 17:43.662
Remember, we did this together?

17:44.797 --> 17:46.165
It's not what you think.

17:46.799 --> 17:50.069
I just caught your friends Tweedle Dank
and Dabby Tweedle

17:50.135 --> 17:52.538
handing out jimmies
in front of my dojang.

17:53.772 --> 17:55.574
My students could've gotten addicted.

17:55.641 --> 17:58.444
Now, hold on, "jimmies"
can mean sprinkles or condoms,

17:58.510 --> 18:00.079
depending on where you grew up.

18:00.679 --> 18:02.781
Well, I grew up in La Cañada.

18:05.451 --> 18:06.652
Just north of Glendale.

18:06.718 --> 18:08.620
It's got good people, excellent schools.

18:09.555 --> 18:13.258
Look, I'm sorry
for whatever Dank and Dabby did,

18:13.325 --> 18:15.127
but they don't work for me.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.595
Actually, Ruth, they kind of do.

18:16.662 --> 18:17.663
Zip it, dropout.

18:19.298 --> 18:20.332
I think you should know

18:20.399 --> 18:23.635
I started a petition to have your ass
thrown out of this retail plaza.

18:23.702 --> 18:26.405
And I gotta tell you,
the response has been overwhelming.

18:26.472 --> 18:27.573
What does that mean?

18:27.639 --> 18:31.343
It means that everybody I talked to
responded in one way or another.

18:32.144 --> 18:33.278
And you should be warned,

18:33.345 --> 18:36.648
because most of them requested that
I come back when they were less busy.

18:37.549 --> 18:40.119
Well, I'd like to make that request
of you now.

18:42.321 --> 18:43.188
Fine.

18:44.756 --> 18:46.725
We were jerk-off buddies in the alley.

18:49.194 --> 18:50.429
And then you ruined it.

18:52.331 --> 18:56.869
Okay, again, it's not what it sounds like.
It's not. It's--

19:07.446 --> 19:08.580
Pete.

19:10.249 --> 19:14.286
Oh, Pete.

19:15.454 --> 19:16.321
Hello?

19:18.924 --> 19:20.192
Hello, Pete.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.329
-Who are you?
-I am Mary Jane.

19:24.396 --> 19:27.166
I am the spiritual embodiment
of the marijuana plant.

19:27.232 --> 19:28.367
Oh, sure.

19:29.268 --> 19:34.439
People also call me Puff Mommy,
Lady Ganja, Green Goddess.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.341
Isn't that a salad dressing?

19:36.708 --> 19:37.576
Ow!

19:38.443 --> 19:39.878
What the hell are you doing here?

19:39.945 --> 19:42.548
I'm setting these plants free
in the forest.

19:42.614 --> 19:45.250
You are
an award-winning grower, Pete.

19:45.317 --> 19:47.653
You should know marijuana's
not meant to be set free!

19:47.719 --> 19:49.254
It's meant to be set on fire.

19:49.321 --> 19:53.425
To be chopped, dried, ground, rolled,
strained, pressed.

19:53.492 --> 19:56.595
Oh, I don't know, they're doing
all kinds of crazy stuff these days.

19:56.662 --> 20:00.199
You seen these "One Gram Dab" videos?
That shit is fucked.

20:01.266 --> 20:04.403
-But they're my babies.
-Then you must kill them.

20:04.469 --> 20:06.872
Like you have done
dozens of times before.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.674
But these plants are special.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.843
-They talk to me.
-No, they don't, you're just lonely.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.712
When was the last time you got laid?

20:13.779 --> 20:16.315
Ugh. Wait, I remember.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.984
It was after that Phish concert
at the Hollywood Bowl.

20:19.251 --> 20:23.255
Oh, yeah. It was stacked parking.
We weren't going anywhere, so...

20:24.356 --> 20:27.593
-Daddy? Who are you talking to?
-No one, Sadie.

20:27.659 --> 20:28.760
No, stop it! Goddamn it!

20:28.827 --> 20:30.429
There is no Sadie!

20:30.996 --> 20:36.935
You take these golden clippers and you cut
those little plants into little pieces.

20:37.002 --> 20:38.237
No.

20:38.303 --> 20:41.006
Don't you want people
to still enjoy Phish concerts?

20:41.273 --> 20:44.276
-Yes.
-Well, this is the only way.

20:45.644 --> 20:47.546
-I can't.
-Oh, God!

20:47.613 --> 20:49.948
Do you need me to fuck some sense
into you?

20:50.649 --> 20:51.516
Okay.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.256
You are a grower.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.459
No, Daddy! Don't!

21:03.895 --> 21:04.863
I love you, Daddy!

21:04.930 --> 21:06.365
- Daddy, no!
- Shh!

21:10.669 --> 21:12.371
Daddy, don't! No!

21:17.342 --> 21:19.845
Hi, I'm Olivia
from Ruth's Alternative Caring.

21:19.911 --> 21:21.880
-And this is my friend Maria.
-Friend?

21:22.047 --> 21:23.615
Aw.

21:25.517 --> 21:28.320
Who has a double-oven
and a big- ass stand mixer, so...

21:28.820 --> 21:31.056
And a housekeeper
that showed us how to use them.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.859
Shout out to Rosita.
Pathway to citizenship.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.665
Now, for the first time ever,
our Strain O' the Day is an edible.

21:39.965 --> 21:43.035
-And it's called...
-Olivia's Shitballs.

21:45.937 --> 21:47.472
- They look like poop.
- Yes.

21:50.342 --> 21:53.412
Okay, baked
from my beloved grandmother's recipe,

21:53.478 --> 21:57.683
these mouth-watering treats
have been the hit of countless potlucks,

21:57.749 --> 21:59.685
church suppers, VFW bake sales...

21:59.751 --> 22:02.454
But now they're filled
with marijuana grass.

22:03.722 --> 22:05.590
You guys know how it works with edibles.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.859
The dosage can be tricky
so start with just one.

22:07.926 --> 22:10.796
Right. Right, right.
Because once you get to number two,

22:14.066 --> 22:15.534
things can get messy.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.504
-Do you get it?
-Okay, stop.

22:20.505 --> 22:21.473
Let's just try one.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.878
Oh, my God. That is some good shit.

22:29.381 --> 22:31.516
Think about all the fun
you can have with them.

22:31.583 --> 22:32.851
Put one on your boss's chair.

22:32.918 --> 22:34.953
Take one to the zoo
and throw it at a monkey.

22:35.020 --> 22:38.056
Or, for that perfect baby shower
party favor...

22:39.558 --> 22:41.393
Aww!

22:42.394 --> 22:43.361
Itty-bitty baby.

22:43.428 --> 22:47.432
Anyway, what used to be
a precious childhood memory

22:47.499 --> 22:49.901
is now available for ten bucks
for a pack of three.

22:49.968 --> 22:52.437
And that's a full movement.

22:55.907 --> 22:56.908
Did you get that one?

22:58.810 --> 23:01.580
-It's a bowel movement,
-Bowel. Yeah, I got it.

23:11.690 --> 23:13.692
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:14.993 --> 23:15.861
So, um...

23:16.862 --> 23:19.030
I haven't done this
in a while, but...

23:20.899 --> 23:22.134
would you wanna have dinner?

23:23.168 --> 23:25.036
You haven't had dinner in a while?

23:28.039 --> 23:29.407
Please don't fuck with me.

23:31.109 --> 23:32.110
This is hard enough.

23:33.411 --> 23:34.179
I'm sorry.

23:34.846 --> 23:37.082
Yes, I would love to have dinner with you,
Carter.

23:38.784 --> 23:39.718
Cool.

23:47.726 --> 23:50.729
You know, I'm really not high at all.
Are you sure we put enough weed in?

23:50.796 --> 23:53.498
Really? Because I'm feeling it all over.

23:53.565 --> 23:55.834
Then again, I'm much smaller than you.

23:57.836 --> 24:00.172
No, no, no. It's just that, um...

24:00.806 --> 24:04.543
I'm petite and you're athletic.

24:05.644 --> 24:06.511
Have another one.

24:09.681 --> 24:11.783
-Hey, Pete.
-What's up?

24:11.850 --> 24:13.518
I harvested the weed.

24:13.585 --> 24:15.620
-Oh, yeah. Cool.
-Yeah, it was.

24:15.687 --> 24:17.055
You know what else was cool?

24:17.122 --> 24:20.158
Mary Jane,
the spiritual embodiment of marijuana,

24:20.225 --> 24:22.127
fucked me sideways last night.

24:23.662 --> 24:25.230
I thought we were making love.

24:26.765 --> 24:27.899
Yeah, of course we were.

24:28.834 --> 24:30.635
You used the F-word.

24:30.702 --> 24:32.170
I'm sorry.

24:32.237 --> 24:35.674
Yeah, this was not just, like,
a one-night thing for me.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.576
No, I know. Me neither.

24:38.009 --> 24:41.847
I'm s-- I don't-- Yeah, I-- Yeah, sure.
Yeah.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.685
There's no one there, right?

24:48.820 --> 24:51.122
No, but he does make a cute couple.

24:52.624 --> 24:54.693
Could I have everybody's attention?

24:55.193 --> 24:57.028
Sorry, baby, I gotta work.

24:59.197 --> 25:02.100
Three months ago my son, Travis,
came back from business school

25:02.167 --> 25:03.735
to help me run this place.

25:04.135 --> 25:10.208
And at the time, I was skeptical
and stubborn and, um, a little hungry.

25:10.275 --> 25:11.509
Olivia, Shitball me.

25:17.048 --> 25:18.984
Oh, fucking A, Olivia.

25:20.685 --> 25:21.553
Mm.

25:21.853 --> 25:22.754
Where was I?

25:22.821 --> 25:23.822
-Skeptical.
-Stubborn.

25:23.889 --> 25:25.523
-A little shrill.
-Pain in the ass.

25:25.590 --> 25:26.858
California.

25:29.261 --> 25:30.562
All right, all right.

25:30.629 --> 25:35.033
Since then, I've come to realize
that Travis knows what he's doing.

25:35.901 --> 25:39.304
And that's made me think of all the things
I haven't done

25:39.571 --> 25:41.106
and I haven't had the time to do,

25:41.172 --> 25:45.176
because I've been so focused
on running this business.

25:46.611 --> 25:51.016
So, this morning
I remembered I'm a lawyer.

25:53.752 --> 25:58.256
And I filed the paperwork
for change of ownership.

25:58.990 --> 26:01.726
So as of now, Travis and I
are equal partners.

26:02.694 --> 26:08.233
And Ruth's Alternative Caring is now
Ruth's Travis Alternative Caring.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.936
-Oh, yay!
-All right. Cool.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.072
Wow, Mom, thank you.

26:14.639 --> 26:15.307
Baby.

26:15.573 --> 26:16.574
Nice.

26:16.641 --> 26:19.210
-Speech.
-Say something.

26:20.111 --> 26:22.213
I don't believe this.

26:22.714 --> 26:24.649
I mean, this is really exciting.
You know?

26:24.716 --> 26:26.918
All of us working together
to make this store--

26:26.985 --> 26:27.953
-DEA!
-DEA!

26:28.019 --> 26:30.055
This is a raid.
Everybody on the ground.

26:30.121 --> 26:31.056
On the ground now!

26:31.122 --> 26:32.223
-Right now!
-Get down!

26:32.290 --> 26:33.158
Get on the ground!

26:33.224 --> 26:34.859
-Get down.
-Down!
