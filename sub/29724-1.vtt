00:34.700 --> 00:36.666
Someone once told me
that the secret to happiness

00:36.668 --> 00:39.471
is to be content no
matter your situation.

00:41.340 --> 00:43.339
My dad didn't wanna be a farmer,

00:43.341 --> 00:45.308
but that's what life handed him.

00:45.310 --> 00:46.876
He worked hard.

00:46.878 --> 00:49.812
Sometimes, that
hard work paid off.

00:49.814 --> 00:50.783
Sometimes it didn't.

00:52.183 --> 00:53.717
But he managed to
find happiness in it

00:53.719 --> 00:55.422
and he always made time for me.

00:58.723 --> 01:01.493
My dad taught me everything
he knew about farming.

01:08.766 --> 01:10.833
He also taught me everything
he knew about baseball.

01:10.835 --> 01:12.368
There ya go, watch
it all the way in.

01:12.370 --> 01:15.238
The greatest
game on earth.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.740
Give me a fastball.

01:16.742 --> 01:18.541
He taught me
how to be a great locator

01:18.543 --> 01:20.212
with a pitch like Greg Maddox,

01:22.180 --> 01:24.450
and how to bring the
heat like Roger Clemons.

01:26.317 --> 01:27.618
Ooh.

01:27.620 --> 01:28.555
Some heat on it.

01:30.156 --> 01:31.555
But too many
years of his hard work

01:31.557 --> 01:33.556
not paying off changed him.

01:33.558 --> 01:35.692
I've already worked
like 30 hours this week!

01:35.694 --> 01:36.894
Nothing seemed to
make him happy.

01:36.896 --> 01:37.860
If you don't show
up one more time

01:37.862 --> 01:38.794
you're coming off the team!

01:38.796 --> 01:40.264
I mean it!

01:40.266 --> 01:41.231
What days do you
want me to go...

01:41.233 --> 01:42.799
Every single day of your life!

01:42.801 --> 01:45.568
And once the drought
hit, he needed me on the farm,

01:45.570 --> 01:47.140
not on the ball field.

01:48.573 --> 01:51.277
But I wasn't gonna set my
dreams aside like my dad had.

01:52.844 --> 01:54.414
I wanted to play in the Majors.

01:55.881 --> 01:58.948
Maybe even find my way into
the Hall of Fame one day.

01:58.950 --> 02:00.883
No matter what it took,

02:00.885 --> 02:03.619
I would fight for the
life that I wanted.

02:03.621 --> 02:05.656
The life that I knew
would make me happy.

02:05.658 --> 02:07.190
What is the
victim's condition?

02:07.192 --> 02:08.925
The victim is
in critical condition.

02:08.926 --> 02:10.827
Do you have a suspect?

02:10.829 --> 02:12.228
Yes.

02:12.230 --> 02:13.596
The suspect is also
in the hospital

02:13.598 --> 02:15.832
and also in critical condition.

02:15.834 --> 02:17.500
Can you provide the
suspects name, age,

02:17.502 --> 02:18.969
and what the charges are for?

02:18.971 --> 02:20.971
Well the suspect is a juvenile

02:20.973 --> 02:22.805
and we've yet to contact
the immediate family,

02:22.807 --> 02:25.709
therefore we cannot release
the name at this time.

02:25.711 --> 02:27.344
However, I can tell
you that the individual

02:27.346 --> 02:29.780
has been charged with
DUI, resisting arrest,

02:29.782 --> 02:31.948
reckless driving, and
aggravated assault

02:31.950 --> 02:33.417
with a motor vehicle.

02:33.419 --> 02:35.452
We should have
further charges filed

02:35.454 --> 02:37.654
after a full investigation.

02:37.656 --> 02:38.854
And when will you be releasing
more information deputy?

02:38.856 --> 02:41.257
As I said, we have a full
investigation pending ma'am

02:41.259 --> 02:42.459
and as we get more...

02:42.461 --> 02:43.927
And the Occonee County
Sheriffs Department

02:43.929 --> 02:45.862
will make no further comments

02:45.864 --> 02:48.232
until we've completed
a full investigation.

02:48.234 --> 02:49.299
Okay Sheriff, just
two more questions

02:49.301 --> 02:50.767
if you don't mind holding
for just a moment.

02:50.769 --> 02:52.639
Sheriff, just a
moment of your time!

02:54.573 --> 02:56.276
Let's just go back to the truck.

03:14.259 --> 03:16.695
What in the heck was
that circus out front?

03:18.296 --> 03:19.762
I was just answering
questions for the media.

03:19.764 --> 03:21.697
Apparently the victim's
a highly regarded

03:21.699 --> 03:22.598
individual in this town.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.436
Media?

03:24.870 --> 03:27.036
City has a population
of 6,000 people

03:27.038 --> 03:29.305
and one small local newspaper.

03:29.307 --> 03:32.409
Look, I know you just transferred
over from Clarke County.

03:32.411 --> 03:35.012
But this is my department.

03:35.014 --> 03:36.746
This is my investigation.

03:36.748 --> 03:39.583
Watkinsville is a small town.

03:39.585 --> 03:42.653
The kind of town where
everybody knows everybody.

03:42.655 --> 03:45.054
We don't have these types
of situations down here.

03:45.056 --> 03:47.291
Last story involving
my department

03:47.293 --> 03:48.858
that made the local paper,

03:48.860 --> 03:51.060
involved a spooked pony.

03:51.062 --> 03:53.465
It got free during
the July 4th parade.

03:55.033 --> 03:55.834
Sorry.

04:03.975 --> 04:06.910
Estimated time of the
accident was 10:15 p.m.

04:06.912 --> 04:08.512
Why was I not notified of it?

04:08.514 --> 04:10.079
I pretty much had
it handled all right.

04:10.081 --> 04:12.014
I filled out the report
and I was just gonna

04:12.016 --> 04:14.685
finish it up and
wait til the morning.

04:14.687 --> 04:15.952
Wait til the morning.

04:15.954 --> 04:18.421
I mean, how severe of a
situation must there be

04:18.423 --> 04:20.423
in Clarke County before
you notify your sergeant?

04:20.425 --> 04:22.058
With all due respect Sheriff,

04:22.060 --> 04:23.426
we handled this
kind of situation

04:23.428 --> 04:25.695
in Clarke County all the time.

04:25.697 --> 04:27.096
You're to have no
further comment with anyone

04:27.098 --> 04:29.765
outside of my department
about this investigation.

04:29.767 --> 04:30.602
Am I clear?

04:33.372 --> 04:35.408
I thought you were the
only one in your department.

04:36.875 --> 04:37.709
Exactly.

04:40.446 --> 04:41.077
Good morning Doc.

04:41.079 --> 04:41.713
Sheriff, Deputy.

04:43.415 --> 04:44.481
How's Milton doing?

04:44.483 --> 04:45.649
He's stable.

04:45.651 --> 04:46.817
Milton had a severe head trauma.

04:46.819 --> 04:48.084
Fractured right arm.

04:48.086 --> 04:49.952
We are keeping him in a
medically induced coma

04:49.954 --> 04:51.555
to control the brain swelling.

04:51.557 --> 04:52.589
How 'bout Mrs. Davis?

04:52.591 --> 04:53.557
She's still in surgery.

04:53.559 --> 04:55.058
Broken bones, internal bleeding,

04:55.060 --> 04:56.459
some spleen damage.

04:56.461 --> 04:58.127
Gonna be a difficult
and long road

04:58.129 --> 04:59.663
to recovery for that one.

04:59.665 --> 05:02.598
Anybody notify
Milton's mother?

05:02.600 --> 05:03.834
When the patient's transported

05:03.836 --> 05:05.435
and it involves an accident,

05:05.437 --> 05:07.740
we leave the notifications
up to your department.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.007
I was afraid of that.

05:11.009 --> 05:12.175
I would like a copy
of the police report

05:12.177 --> 05:14.844
and any crime scene photos
when they're available.

05:14.846 --> 05:15.681
Here you go.

05:16.848 --> 05:18.548
Great, I'll make
a copy of these.

05:18.550 --> 05:19.382
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

05:19.384 --> 05:20.019
Thanks Doc.

05:22.855 --> 05:23.689
After you.

05:33.999 --> 05:35.865
What in the heck is this for?

05:38.637 --> 05:40.771
He's a flight risk.

05:40.773 --> 05:42.942
Look Sheriff, I'm just
following procedure.

05:46.144 --> 05:48.781
The kid is in a coma.

05:51.716 --> 05:53.949
What, you know him?

05:53.951 --> 05:55.555
I grew up with his father.

05:59.124 --> 06:03.125
Milton had a very, very
bright future ahead of him.

06:09.567 --> 06:10.867
You ever wonder

06:10.869 --> 06:13.469
why God let's bad things

06:13.471 --> 06:14.507
happen to good people?

06:28.553 --> 06:32.524
Male: Strike!

06:39.464 --> 06:40.563
Hey there he is.

06:40.565 --> 06:41.832
You did great today man.

06:41.834 --> 06:42.935
I'll catch you around.

06:44.069 --> 06:46.937
You played awesome today.

06:46.939 --> 06:47.870
Thank you.

06:47.872 --> 06:49.040
You wanna go for pizza?

06:50.576 --> 06:51.411
Wish I could.

06:52.543 --> 06:54.043
But you know my
dad's waiting on me.

06:54.045 --> 06:54.846
Come on.

06:57.014 --> 06:58.084
I'll take ya there.

06:59.050 --> 06:59.983
Hop in.

06:59.985 --> 07:01.052
It's better than nothing.

07:29.615 --> 07:30.449
You win?

07:35.019 --> 07:35.985
Yes!

07:35.987 --> 07:37.219
Milton!

07:37.221 --> 07:38.723
Oh I'm so proud of you!

07:39.690 --> 07:41.558
I will put it with
your collection.

07:41.560 --> 07:42.194
Thanks mom.

07:44.629 --> 07:46.098
Dad's been looking for you.

07:47.232 --> 07:49.168
Told him you went to
the barn 30 minutes ago.

08:53.865 --> 08:54.866
Thank you.

09:03.975 --> 09:05.374
Milton.

09:05.376 --> 09:06.645
Say grace please.

09:11.716 --> 09:13.882
Lord, bless this
food to our use

09:13.884 --> 09:15.053
and us to Thy service,

09:16.254 --> 09:18.622
and make us ever mindful
of the needs of others.

09:18.624 --> 09:19.355
Amen.

09:19.357 --> 09:20.191
Amen.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.661
Give me some corn please.

09:24.663 --> 09:27.030
Did you ask Milton
about his game?

09:27.032 --> 09:30.336
That would be a big negative.

09:35.173 --> 09:36.008
Ted.

09:39.845 --> 09:40.846
Well?

09:43.881 --> 09:44.716
Milton.

09:46.018 --> 09:46.851
We won.

09:49.754 --> 09:51.856
They move to the
championship next week.

09:53.859 --> 09:54.991
I hope that's not
gonna get in the way

09:54.993 --> 09:55.927
of your work around here.

09:57.663 --> 09:58.895
I'll get everything done.

09:58.897 --> 10:00.964
I've been picking up
your slack a lot lately.

10:00.966 --> 10:02.766
No matter what I do,

10:02.768 --> 10:04.434
it's never enough.

10:04.436 --> 10:06.201
My grades are great!

10:06.203 --> 10:08.807
I can't remember the last
time I got in trouble.

10:10.042 --> 10:11.807
You talk about slacking,
why don't you cut me some?

10:11.809 --> 10:14.009
Don't you dare

10:14.011 --> 10:16.381
sit at my table and
get smart with me.

10:23.822 --> 10:26.089
What did I tell ya?

10:26.091 --> 10:28.458
I should've never let him play
baseball in the first place.

10:28.460 --> 10:30.062
The kids developing an attitude.

10:32.330 --> 10:34.329
His priorities are out of whack.

10:34.331 --> 10:36.031
He's forgotten what his
responsibilities are

10:36.033 --> 10:37.269
to this family and this farm.

10:38.202 --> 10:41.237
Baseball is a hobby.

10:41.239 --> 10:42.372
It is not a career.

10:42.374 --> 10:44.074
Ted.

10:44.076 --> 10:45.076
He's still a kid.

10:46.344 --> 10:49.012
Besides, he likes it.

10:49.014 --> 10:50.216
He loves it.

10:51.249 --> 10:52.851
And he's really good at it.

10:54.052 --> 10:55.388
Don't steal his joy!

10:56.988 --> 10:59.158
He has a chance for a
college education somewhere.

11:00.991 --> 11:02.124
Well learning
the family business

11:02.126 --> 11:03.294
is what he should be doing.

11:10.802 --> 11:12.171
Good morning and welcome.

11:13.370 --> 11:16.805
I'm glad that you decided
to worship with us.

11:16.807 --> 11:19.110
Today we'll be reading
from the book of James

11:20.177 --> 11:22.748
chapter one, verse 12.

11:24.448 --> 11:28.050
"For such a man
has stood the test

11:28.052 --> 11:30.389
"and will receive
the crown of life.

11:32.490 --> 11:34.190
"That the Lord,
the righteous judge

11:34.192 --> 11:35.760
"should get them in that day."

11:41.232 --> 11:42.033
Hey, Milton.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.335
Can I get a ride?

11:47.272 --> 11:51.174
Let's go.

12:05.557 --> 12:06.959
Man you're so blessed.

12:08.125 --> 12:10.228
I wish I was born with
a God given talent.

12:12.264 --> 12:13.099
It's not,

12:17.168 --> 12:19.004
it's not all it
appears all the time.

12:21.206 --> 12:23.175
Things are tough
at home right now.

12:25.277 --> 12:26.376
For as long as I can remember,

12:26.378 --> 12:28.980
I've been listening to
this inner voice calling me

12:30.282 --> 12:31.150
to pursue baseball.

12:32.817 --> 12:34.083
I don't know what's best for me,

12:34.085 --> 12:36.319
I don't know what's
best for my family.

12:36.321 --> 12:37.156
I don't,

12:40.125 --> 12:43.162
I don't wanna cause pain to
those closest to me, you know?

12:46.096 --> 12:47.063
I'm not gonna lie,

12:47.065 --> 12:48.834
the selfish part of
me wants you to stay.

12:50.402 --> 12:52.468
But if I were you
I'd get as far away

12:52.470 --> 12:54.240
from this hick town as possible.

12:55.874 --> 12:57.843
Even if it means we
can't hangout any more.

13:00.110 --> 13:03.349
If I pursue baseball and fail,

13:05.616 --> 13:07.118
yeah, I won't regret that.

13:08.253 --> 13:09.955
But I know the one
thing I would regret,

13:11.556 --> 13:13.323
is not trying.

13:13.325 --> 13:15.027
That's a great
way to look at it.

13:16.394 --> 13:18.062
But don't you forget
about our boys back home.

13:19.230 --> 13:21.030
You always hear these
crazy stories about

13:21.032 --> 13:23.299
celebrities and baseball players

13:23.301 --> 13:25.838
buying their friends
houses and cars and stuff.

13:27.239 --> 13:29.238
If I make it I'm
buying you both.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.239
You serious?

13:30.241 --> 13:31.940
Yup.

13:31.942 --> 13:34.480
Buy you a house and that bad
boy gonna have wheels too baby.

13:35.614 --> 13:38.348
All right big
shot, I'll take two.

13:53.097 --> 13:54.363
Hey.

13:54.365 --> 13:56.067
Any chance you can
skip 7th period?

13:57.001 --> 13:58.267
Not today.

13:58.269 --> 13:59.203
What's wrong?

13:59.205 --> 13:59.902
Coach scheduled
an extra practice.

13:59.904 --> 14:02.638
And that's got you irritated?

14:02.640 --> 14:04.641
I'm not worried
about the practice.

14:04.643 --> 14:05.474
And I gotta tell my Dad

14:05.476 --> 14:07.109
why I'm missing work.

14:07.111 --> 14:08.444
He's already got me
doing a million things

14:08.446 --> 14:09.981
and I have this to worry about.

14:14.653 --> 14:18.021
Hey Mil, you know we're
all proud of you right?

14:18.023 --> 14:19.388
The whole town is.

14:19.390 --> 14:20.555
You're a special kid

14:20.557 --> 14:22.394
and God has truly
blessed you with talent.

14:23.528 --> 14:24.459
Thank you coach.

14:24.461 --> 14:26.128
And I tell you this because

14:26.130 --> 14:28.363
I need you to stay focused
for just a little bit longer.

14:28.365 --> 14:30.336
You worked really
hard up to this point.

14:31.336 --> 14:32.468
Now let's go win our team

14:32.470 --> 14:33.402
a state baseball
championship all right?

14:33.404 --> 14:34.206
Yes sir.

14:51.288 --> 14:52.124
It's open.

15:03.434 --> 15:06.004
I'm excited about your
game tomorrow Milton.

15:08.974 --> 15:11.406
I'm gonna do
everything in my power

15:11.408 --> 15:13.544
to make sure that your
father is there too.

15:14.645 --> 15:15.578
Yeah, I don't want him going

15:15.580 --> 15:17.313
if he doesn't want to go.

15:17.315 --> 15:18.448
It's not that
your father doesn't

15:18.450 --> 15:19.551
wanna go to your game.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.923
I know sometimes it must be
really hard to understand.

15:28.426 --> 15:33.132
Your father is under a
tremendous amount of stress.

15:34.698 --> 15:38.437
He's working twice as hard
for half the return Milton.

15:39.770 --> 15:42.537
He's doing everything he can

15:42.539 --> 15:46.142
to provide for us and
to keep the farm afloat.

15:46.144 --> 15:49.012
I understand why he cares
about the farm and I get it.

15:49.014 --> 15:51.649
I mean, he doesn't even want
me to try pursuing baseball.

15:53.684 --> 15:58.690
Your father was forced into
farming at the age of 12.

16:00.225 --> 16:04.129
Ted had no other opportunities.

16:05.562 --> 16:09.065
He was never given the choice

16:09.067 --> 16:10.970
to pursue other things.

16:12.669 --> 16:14.539
This is all he knows Milton.

16:16.206 --> 16:17.042
I know.

16:18.777 --> 16:20.579
Your father loves
you very much.

16:22.212 --> 16:24.647
Yeah, he has a funny way
of showing it sometimes.

16:24.649 --> 16:27.452
You know, it's the same sad
story for all of my friends.

16:28.686 --> 16:32.291
They finish school, it's
off to work in the fields.

16:33.258 --> 16:34.660
No one dreams past high school.

16:36.160 --> 16:39.197
No one new moves here
and no one ever leaves.

16:40.631 --> 16:42.297
I believe God has a
bigger plan for my life.

16:42.299 --> 16:43.769
I know He does.

16:44.668 --> 16:49.204
That my son is the real reason

16:49.206 --> 16:50.641
your father is so stressed.

16:51.708 --> 16:52.744
Good night.

16:53.677 --> 16:54.712
I love you.

16:56.681 --> 16:57.716
Love you, too.

17:16.101 --> 17:18.800
How's it going?

17:18.803 --> 17:21.470
Mr. Gravitt, how are you sir?

17:21.472 --> 17:22.738
Good.

17:22.740 --> 17:24.339
Things looking good?

17:24.342 --> 17:26.776
Well, I guess as
good as they can me.

17:26.778 --> 17:29.478
Listen, I know I
owe you some money

17:29.480 --> 17:32.151
and I'm doing
everything I can do

17:32.817 --> 17:35.317
to get it happening, you know.

17:35.319 --> 17:37.819
Corn's pretty much
wiped out right now,

17:37.821 --> 17:39.221
we're just doing
everything we can

17:39.223 --> 17:41.623
to get back from this
drought you know.

17:41.625 --> 17:42.658
Yeah I know.

17:42.660 --> 17:43.860
It's hard on everybody.

17:43.862 --> 17:45.527
Let's just keep
praying in service.

17:45.529 --> 17:46.528
Yeah.

17:46.530 --> 17:47.763
I'm believing in you now.

17:47.765 --> 17:48.597
Yes sir.

17:48.599 --> 17:49.599
Okay.

17:49.601 --> 17:50.833
I appreciate it.

17:50.835 --> 17:51.767
It's gonna work
out all right okay?

17:51.769 --> 17:53.469
Just let me know if
you're in trouble.

17:53.471 --> 17:54.370
I will, I will.

17:54.372 --> 17:55.571
All right.

17:55.573 --> 17:56.404
Thank you sir.

17:56.406 --> 17:57.408
Check on you later.

18:17.494 --> 18:18.830
Sheriff.

18:22.567 --> 18:23.431
Time!

18:23.433 --> 18:24.603
Time!

18:25.537 --> 18:27.172
Coach, don't take me out now.

18:28.605 --> 18:30.672
How ya feeling?

18:30.674 --> 18:31.940
Doing good.

18:31.942 --> 18:33.278
No you're not.

18:34.511 --> 18:35.443
Look over at that entrance gate,

18:35.445 --> 18:37.715
I want you to see something.

18:41.486 --> 18:42.287
You good?

18:44.655 --> 18:46.255
Bring it home.

19:29.267 --> 19:30.600
Strike
three, you're out!

19:53.825 --> 19:54.757
Hey Milton!

19:54.759 --> 19:55.961
Milton come here!

19:59.263 --> 20:00.863
Milton, I'd like
to introduce you to

20:00.865 --> 20:02.698
Coach Dooley from
Mountain University.

20:02.700 --> 20:03.899
Congratulations
on a great season

20:03.901 --> 20:06.936
and bringing your team to
its first state championship.

20:06.938 --> 20:08.336
Thank you sir.

20:08.338 --> 20:09.271
Milton, I've
been following you

20:09.273 --> 20:10.407
and your team this season.

20:10.409 --> 20:12.874
And I must admit, your
statistics are some of the best

20:12.876 --> 20:14.844
ever recorded in the southeast.

20:14.846 --> 20:16.411
Thank you very much.

20:16.413 --> 20:19.748
It's a team sport, our
whole team was great.

20:19.750 --> 20:21.017
I couldn't of done
it without 'em.

20:21.019 --> 20:22.684
Mountain University recruits
at one of the highest levels

20:22.686 --> 20:24.019
in collegiate sports.

20:24.021 --> 20:25.854
And you're the caliber
of player we want

20:25.856 --> 20:27.722
representing our team.

20:27.724 --> 20:28.724
Here comes
his parents now.

20:28.726 --> 20:29.959
Now that the season is over,

20:29.961 --> 20:31.059
I'd love for you to
come visit our campus

20:31.061 --> 20:33.062
and check out our program.

20:33.064 --> 20:34.430
Yes sir.

20:34.432 --> 20:35.965
What can
I help you with?

20:35.967 --> 20:39.334
Mr. and Mrs. Young, say
hello to Coach Dooley.

20:39.336 --> 20:40.670
He was just commenting
what a great game

20:40.672 --> 20:42.371
and a great season
your son played.

20:42.373 --> 20:44.910
You got one mighty talented
ballplayer on your hands.

20:46.310 --> 20:47.410
He got any brothers?

20:49.579 --> 20:51.080
Mountain University
is really interested

20:51.082 --> 20:53.951
in having your son attend
our college next fall.

20:55.420 --> 20:58.321
I'd like to set up a meeting
and discuss the details.

20:58.323 --> 20:59.354
Well I'm not sure
that college is

20:59.356 --> 21:00.323
right for our family right now.

21:00.325 --> 21:01.556
Ted, just listen.

21:01.558 --> 21:03.325
Mountain University
offers scholarships

21:03.327 --> 21:04.994
and grant programs
for kids like Milton.

21:04.996 --> 21:06.429
Kids like Milton.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.563
I'm not really sure
what that implies.

21:07.565 --> 21:09.465
Mr. Young, let's be honest.

21:09.467 --> 21:11.866
This town is limited at best

21:11.868 --> 21:14.639
at what it has to offer it's
students after graduation.

21:15.940 --> 21:18.673
This is an opportunity
of a lifetime.

21:18.675 --> 21:21.344
Yeah well, like I said,

21:21.346 --> 21:24.546
college isn't for us right now.

21:24.548 --> 21:25.381
Thank you.

21:25.383 --> 21:26.614
Let's go.

21:39.364 --> 21:40.499
Mind if I come in?

21:57.749 --> 22:01.417
You know, since you
were a little kid

22:01.419 --> 22:04.620
your mom and I both
knew that you were

22:04.622 --> 22:06.091
destined for something great.

22:07.892 --> 22:12.064
We always knew that God had
big plans for your life.

22:13.964 --> 22:14.799
I guess

22:16.467 --> 22:18.637
somewhere along the
way over time it just,

22:19.670 --> 22:21.440
I guess I got resentful.

22:22.673 --> 22:23.775
And then I got scared.

22:27.412 --> 22:29.480
I had 18 years to prepare
for this and I blew it.

22:33.550 --> 22:36.151
I just wanna tell
you that I'm sorry

22:36.153 --> 22:37.719
that I haven't been
there more for you,

22:37.721 --> 22:39.590
while you're
pursuing your dreams.

22:41.826 --> 22:43.926
In case you didn't know it,

22:43.928 --> 22:46.998
I am so proud of you son.

23:01.578 --> 23:03.581
I want you to have this.

23:06.884 --> 23:09.488
My Daddy gave it to me and
his Daddy gave it to him.

23:11.588 --> 23:16.191
Maybe someday you'll have
someone to give it to.

23:16.193 --> 23:17.759
You serious?

23:17.761 --> 23:18.596
Yeah.

23:37.647 --> 23:38.680
Milton.

23:38.682 --> 23:39.750
Come on, wake up!

23:40.917 --> 23:42.551
It's Saturday, you overslept.

23:42.553 --> 23:43.955
Market opens in 10 minutes.

23:46.156 --> 23:47.555
Your Dad left 45 minutes ago.

23:47.557 --> 23:48.757
Don't be late.

23:48.759 --> 23:50.127
Then I'll have to hear
about it all week.

23:55.799 --> 23:57.034
Milton! Milton!

23:58.201 --> 23:59.634
Your Father's in the
field gathering peaches,

23:59.636 --> 24:01.505
get there before him
and open the store.

24:13.951 --> 24:15.651
Good morning.

24:15.653 --> 24:16.485
Thought I would
get in here early

24:16.487 --> 24:18.554
before Katherine's
pies got gone.

24:18.556 --> 24:19.255
How ya doing today Earl?

24:19.257 --> 24:20.158
Oh mighty fine.

24:21.692 --> 24:23.194
Apple or peach?

24:24.628 --> 24:25.794
I'll take a peach.

24:25.796 --> 24:27.962
That'll be $6 please.

24:27.964 --> 24:29.667
All right, there ya go.

24:31.167 --> 24:32.735
I read that you signed
with Mountain University.

24:32.737 --> 24:33.772
That's awesome.

24:34.739 --> 24:36.971
My wife wanted me to
get your autograph

24:36.973 --> 24:37.807
before you go famous.

24:39.210 --> 24:40.676
It's really not
that big of a deal.

24:40.678 --> 24:41.680
Go ahead, come on.

24:45.950 --> 24:46.882
Appreciate it.

24:46.884 --> 24:47.850
Hey, congrats, that's awesome.

24:47.852 --> 24:48.784
Thank you sir.

24:48.786 --> 24:49.817
Have a good one.

24:49.819 --> 24:50.654
You too.

24:53.190 --> 24:54.823
You guys ready?

24:54.825 --> 24:55.894
How ya doing?

24:57.193 --> 24:58.794
Two, four, six.

24:58.796 --> 25:00.499
That'll be $3 please.

25:01.999 --> 25:03.735
How ya doing, good.

25:09.707 --> 25:10.805
Is that the last pie?

25:10.807 --> 25:11.840
Yes.

25:11.842 --> 25:12.874
Let me get it.

25:12.876 --> 25:13.709
How much are they?

25:13.711 --> 25:14.880
$6.

25:15.846 --> 25:16.978
Thank you.

25:16.980 --> 25:17.813
Appreciate it.

25:17.815 --> 25:18.850
Enjoy.

25:22.153 --> 25:24.689
Hey hun, how's sales been?

25:26.691 --> 25:27.323
Pretty good.

25:27.325 --> 25:28.159
Yeah?

25:29.926 --> 25:32.161
May I
please have a break?

25:32.163 --> 25:32.998
Sure.

25:49.180 --> 25:50.582
Hey handsome!

25:55.653 --> 25:57.920
What are you doing here?

25:57.922 --> 26:00.823
I came to kidnap you
and take you to lunch.

26:00.825 --> 26:02.794
You are so sweet.

26:04.194 --> 26:05.861
You know I can't
get away right now.

26:05.863 --> 26:08.396
My dad is crazy on Saturdays.

26:08.398 --> 26:12.000
You leave for
college in two weeks!

26:12.002 --> 26:14.870
What is the worst your
dad can do to you?

26:14.872 --> 26:16.872
Besides, he's gotta get used to

26:16.874 --> 26:18.143
running the farm without you.

26:22.747 --> 26:23.348
Lunch.

26:25.316 --> 26:26.981
How 'bout you
let me take you to

26:26.983 --> 26:28.153
dinner tonight instead?

26:29.319 --> 26:30.853
I got you a present.

26:30.855 --> 26:31.987
No!

26:31.989 --> 26:32.824
Look.

26:36.059 --> 26:37.258
Where did you get this?

26:37.260 --> 26:38.093
You like it?

26:38.095 --> 26:38.930
I love it.

26:40.897 --> 26:42.634
Why are you so good to me?

26:43.968 --> 26:45.234
You didn't have to do that.

26:45.236 --> 26:46.071
So...

26:48.439 --> 26:50.072
You know I can't.

26:50.074 --> 26:51.209
I made peach cobbler.

26:52.175 --> 26:54.378
Uh huh, uh huh.

26:55.980 --> 26:56.815
Yes!

26:57.914 --> 26:58.750
Woo!

27:02.252 --> 27:07.258
If my dad catches
us.

27:07.991 --> 27:08.990
Don't you dare.

27:08.992 --> 27:10.361
No, don't you dare!

27:15.066 --> 27:15.933
Give me that!

27:25.776 --> 27:26.410
Yeah!

27:29.079 --> 27:31.415
You almost poked my eye out!

27:39.155 --> 27:40.389
Tell me you're gonna miss me.

27:40.391 --> 27:42.093
Just don't forget
about us okay?

27:52.769 --> 27:53.937
We love you.

27:59.977 --> 28:04.949
Let's go.

28:56.032 --> 28:57.034
Are you Brad?

28:58.201 --> 28:59.037
Who's asking?

29:00.003 --> 29:00.771
Milton.

29:02.239 --> 29:03.205
Milton Young.

29:03.207 --> 29:04.909
I think I'm your new roommate.

29:06.410 --> 29:09.010
You must be looking
for the baseball dorms.

29:09.012 --> 29:09.847
Wrong building.

29:11.816 --> 29:12.450
My bad.

29:23.861 --> 29:24.496
Hey Milton.

29:26.830 --> 29:29.264
Come back man, that
was way too easy.

29:30.366 --> 29:32.601
I see it's gonna be a
long rookie camp for you.

29:32.603 --> 29:33.602
What's up man?

29:33.604 --> 29:34.836
Chill, how are you?

29:34.838 --> 29:36.305
All right.

29:36.307 --> 29:39.043
What do you expect from
the hick out of Watkinsville?

29:41.244 --> 29:43.045
Milton this is Ryan.

29:43.047 --> 29:44.281
Ryan this is Milton.

29:51.521 --> 29:52.353
Don't worry about him.

29:52.355 --> 29:53.391
Come on, get your bag.

29:55.593 --> 29:57.226
What's his problem?

29:57.228 --> 29:59.995
Ryan's a little
salty by nature.

29:59.997 --> 30:02.534
To answer your question
specifically, it's you.

30:04.234 --> 30:05.334
What'd I do?

30:05.336 --> 30:06.503
You're a threat freshman.

30:08.239 --> 30:09.438
I don't understand.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.373
Look, I know you're
used to go team,

30:11.375 --> 30:12.540
but let's face it,

30:12.542 --> 30:15.177
the Yankees ain't drafting
a whole team, you know?

30:15.179 --> 30:16.411
That bunk right there is yours

30:16.413 --> 30:19.213
and the small closet
is yours as well.

30:19.215 --> 30:21.016
Suit up, practice
is in 20 minutes.

30:21.018 --> 30:22.351
You can walk with
me to the fields.

30:22.353 --> 30:23.421
Are you serious?

30:25.355 --> 30:26.520
Serious about what?

30:26.522 --> 30:28.523
I thought practice
started tomorrow?

30:28.525 --> 30:30.228
No, practice is today.

30:31.895 --> 30:33.194
And listen,

30:33.196 --> 30:35.296
so you gotta make both beds

30:35.298 --> 30:36.931
since you're a
freshman of course.

30:36.933 --> 30:38.600
I like my sheets
tucked in tight,

30:38.602 --> 30:42.006
bottom loose, and my
pillow lightly fluffed.

30:42.940 --> 30:44.506
And what's mine is mine,

30:44.508 --> 30:47.111
and what's yours is also mine.

30:48.311 --> 30:50.113
I got this hat right
here that you can wear

30:51.315 --> 30:53.051
and impress Coach Dooley.

30:54.018 --> 30:54.986
Welcome to the team.

30:56.019 --> 30:57.355
Welcome to baseball camp.

30:58.454 --> 31:00.521
We've got three upcoming
freshman players

31:00.523 --> 31:01.458
I'd like to introduce.

31:02.692 --> 31:05.960
Right fielder from Colquitt
county, welcome Scott Snyder.

31:09.967 --> 31:12.503
Catcher from Valdosta,
welcome Jason Campbell.

31:14.637 --> 31:16.406
And from Watkinsville, Georgia,

31:17.240 --> 31:20.441
Class AAAAA state MVP,

31:20.443 --> 31:22.180
welcome Milton Young!

31:24.548 --> 31:26.047
Let's make all
these guys welcome

31:26.049 --> 31:27.117
and part of the team.

31:27.984 --> 31:29.250
Let's get with your coaches,

31:29.252 --> 31:30.518
take your position on the field,

31:30.520 --> 31:32.520
let's play some baseball!

31:32.522 --> 31:36.557
Let's go!

31:36.559 --> 31:37.595
Hustle up guys!

31:44.468 --> 31:46.168
This kids good.

31:46.170 --> 31:46.971
Best I've seen.

31:50.606 --> 31:52.542
Yes ma, I got plenty to eat.

31:54.077 --> 31:56.513
They got the food plan so
we're eating like every hour.

32:00.017 --> 32:00.618
How's Dad?

32:02.385 --> 32:03.288
Tell him I called.

32:05.021 --> 32:05.656
Love you.

32:10.326 --> 32:12.029
No cellphones
where you're from?

32:14.198 --> 32:15.633
I'm talking to you farm boy.

32:19.635 --> 32:20.768
I'm surprised you guys even

32:20.770 --> 32:22.539
have baseball in Watkinsville.

32:24.107 --> 32:25.273
From what I hear you
hicks play in cornfields,

32:25.275 --> 32:26.678
is that right?

32:28.211 --> 32:30.711
Look, we were all
heroes in high school.

32:30.713 --> 32:32.146
Every last one of us.

32:32.148 --> 32:33.715
You see, that doesn't
make you any different.

32:33.717 --> 32:37.088
In fact, compared to most
of us you're just average.

32:38.388 --> 32:39.653
So what did you think,

32:39.655 --> 32:41.456
you were just gonna
stroll right in here

32:41.458 --> 32:43.995
and take my starting position?

32:44.728 --> 32:46.795
Learn your place rookie

32:46.797 --> 32:48.098
or I'll put you there.

32:50.601 --> 32:54.402
Look, yeah I'm just
grateful for the opportunity.

32:54.404 --> 32:55.636
Yeah, you're just thankful
for the opportunity.

32:55.638 --> 32:56.540
No, that's cool.

32:58.709 --> 33:00.342
I'm not just gonna stand here

33:00.344 --> 33:02.677
and let some hillbilly
bumpkin row in here

33:02.679 --> 33:05.580
on a tractor thinking
he's gonna start over me.

33:05.582 --> 33:07.382
So this pipe dream
you have of being

33:07.384 --> 33:08.586
the big shot on campus,

33:09.720 --> 33:11.521
I'm not gonna allow for it okay!

33:13.589 --> 33:15.559
Look, I don't know
what your deal is,

33:17.094 --> 33:19.628
whatever juice you're on
has gone to your head bud.

33:19.630 --> 33:20.694
You think I'm using steroids,

33:20.696 --> 33:21.630
is that what you're saying?

33:21.632 --> 33:23.331
Something's up.

33:23.333 --> 33:26.267
You have no idea what you're
getting yourself into buddy!

33:26.269 --> 33:27.102
You're a joke.

33:27.104 --> 33:27.739
I'm a joke?

33:29.272 --> 33:31.442
Get off me!

33:33.242 --> 33:34.745
Farm boy I will end you.

33:36.480 --> 33:37.711
Believe that.

33:37.713 --> 33:38.750
Come on man.

33:43.287 --> 33:44.786
You haven't been
able to make the

33:44.788 --> 33:47.354
minimum payment on your
current outstanding loans.

33:47.356 --> 33:48.725
Yeah, I understand.

33:50.727 --> 33:52.460
Why would the
state take the risk

33:52.462 --> 33:54.228
of extending additional credit

33:54.230 --> 33:55.729
to a client who currently can't

33:55.731 --> 33:57.167
make the minimum payment?

33:58.367 --> 33:59.633
Well without that
additional credit

33:59.635 --> 34:01.635
how are we supposed to
keep the farm going?

34:01.637 --> 34:02.737
Without fertilizer and seed

34:02.739 --> 34:04.709
we're gonna have to
close down in six months.

34:05.843 --> 34:07.209
Well this has
been a particularly

34:07.211 --> 34:09.643
hard two years on our state.

34:09.646 --> 34:12.350
Our community in particular
has been hit very hard.

34:13.550 --> 34:15.784
Many families we have
helped for generations

34:15.786 --> 34:17.552
are being denied
and turned away.

34:17.554 --> 34:19.487
Don't they care
how hard we've worked

34:19.489 --> 34:22.123
and the role we've
played in the community?

34:22.126 --> 34:23.525
Unfortunately Mrs. Young,

34:23.527 --> 34:24.824
the states been
forced to make cuts

34:24.827 --> 34:27.829
across the board
for many programs.

34:27.831 --> 34:30.364
A drought is considered
an act of God.

34:30.367 --> 34:32.434
It's outside of human control.

34:32.436 --> 34:33.538
It's nothing personal.

34:42.777 --> 34:43.681
Hey Ryan.

34:45.315 --> 34:46.914
What's up coach?

34:46.916 --> 34:48.418
We're starting
Milton tomorrow.

34:49.585 --> 34:51.485
No, you're making a mistake.

34:51.487 --> 34:52.454
We're starting
Milton tomorrow.

34:52.456 --> 34:53.291
You're done.

35:03.266 --> 35:04.199
Whoa man!

35:04.201 --> 35:05.266
Coach, he's all right!

35:05.268 --> 35:06.570
Ryan that's enough!

35:44.641 --> 35:48.909
I lost the starting
job to that kid.

35:48.911 --> 35:51.246
I did everything I could okay.

35:51.248 --> 35:52.713
How come everything
I've ever done

35:52.715 --> 35:54.682
is not enough for you Dad?

35:54.684 --> 35:57.154
I just wanna be appreciated Dad!

36:00.224 --> 36:00.956
Bye.

36:00.958 --> 36:02.193
Bye!

37:39.523 --> 37:41.492
Guys, Ryan had a
lot of anger issues,

37:42.492 --> 37:44.492
long before Milton arrived.

37:44.494 --> 37:46.327
But what we need to do right now

37:46.329 --> 37:48.595
is just have a
moment of silence.

37:48.597 --> 37:49.900
Take our hats off.

38:03.112 --> 38:05.380
Let's get back to practice.

38:05.382 --> 38:08.016
Milton, I need to
see you a minute.

38:08.018 --> 38:09.918
Coach, I hope you know
it's not what I wanted.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.655
No, no, no, no son.

38:13.824 --> 38:15.425
It's your Father.

say a proper goodbye.

39:14.150 --> 39:17.552
That's what I mean
by terrible things

39:17.554 --> 39:18.588
happening to good people.

39:22.025 --> 39:24.758
Well, with all
due respect Sheriff,

39:24.760 --> 39:27.028
this boy committed
a heinous crime

39:27.030 --> 39:28.262
and I think you
need to save your

39:28.264 --> 39:31.501
kind words and your prayers
for the victim and her family.

39:32.635 --> 39:33.601
Am I interrupting?

39:33.603 --> 39:34.436
Don't think so.

39:34.438 --> 39:35.637
Good.

39:35.639 --> 39:36.804
Sheriff, I wanna
show you something.

39:36.806 --> 39:39.673
At first, correct
me if I'm wrong.

39:39.675 --> 39:42.142
The preliminary accident
investigation shows

39:42.144 --> 39:45.546
that the truck entered
the ravine head on.

39:45.548 --> 39:46.981
Therefore the damage on impact

39:46.983 --> 39:49.818
was absorbed at the
front, straight on.

39:49.820 --> 39:51.151
Paramedics stated that Milton

39:51.153 --> 39:53.621
had to be cut from seatbelt.

39:53.623 --> 39:55.824
Which means he was
wearing his seatbelt

39:55.826 --> 39:57.958
at the time of the accident.

39:57.960 --> 40:01.695
Now here, due to the
improvements in seatbelt safety,

40:01.697 --> 40:03.530
thank goodness.

40:03.532 --> 40:06.066
We rarely see these
types of injuries

40:06.068 --> 40:07.969
when the victim's
wearing seatbelt.

40:07.971 --> 40:09.670
Especially when
wearing them properly.

40:09.672 --> 40:10.774
What are you saying?

40:12.476 --> 40:15.642
It is almost impossible
for Milton to sustain

40:15.644 --> 40:17.744
this type of blunt
force trauma to the head

40:17.746 --> 40:19.849
and arm in this accident.

40:21.585 --> 40:23.885
Milton did not sustain these

40:23.887 --> 40:25.820
injuries from the car accident.

40:25.822 --> 40:28.956
It is very likely
these injuries were

40:28.958 --> 40:30.992
sustained outside the vehicle

40:30.994 --> 40:33.063
prior to the truck
entering the ravine.

40:41.538 --> 40:42.740
Well I'll be.

40:43.639 --> 40:44.641
Well.

40:45.641 --> 40:46.710
Thank you doctor.

40:47.710 --> 40:48.678
Of course.

41:10.900 --> 41:11.734
Milton.

41:14.103 --> 41:15.603
Hey.

41:15.605 --> 41:16.240
Hey!

41:19.976 --> 41:21.045
Nurse! Nurse!

41:22.112 --> 41:23.311
He's awake!

41:23.313 --> 41:24.215
He's awake!

41:44.900 --> 41:46.036
Need a hand?

41:47.903 --> 41:49.840
Things been
overheating all week.

41:57.746 --> 41:58.713
Here we go.

41:58.715 --> 42:02.286
Looks like a loose
radiator hose there.

42:03.820 --> 42:05.523
Let's see if she'll turn over.

42:21.338 --> 42:22.170
I appreciate it.

42:22.172 --> 42:23.037
You need a ride?

42:23.039 --> 42:25.238
I'm good, thanks.

42:25.240 --> 42:26.610
Have a blessed day.

42:29.713 --> 42:31.713
So due to the
injuries sustained,

42:31.715 --> 42:34.218
Milton has radial nerve palsy.

42:35.117 --> 42:35.985
Or wrist drop.

42:37.621 --> 42:40.755
Now radial nerve palsy is
a neurological condition

42:40.757 --> 42:44.258
that causes curved
or bent fingers.

42:44.260 --> 42:45.927
Curved wrist.

42:45.929 --> 42:47.829
Sometimes, in certain cases,

42:47.831 --> 42:50.632
it can be corrected
with surgery.

42:50.634 --> 42:52.934
Often, it is permanent.

42:52.936 --> 42:55.936
Now I just want you guys
prepared for everything.

42:55.938 --> 43:00.240
Milton has one of the more
severe cases that I've seen.

43:00.242 --> 43:01.275
Now it's just my opinion,

43:01.277 --> 43:02.976
but,

43:02.978 --> 43:05.112
it's likely Milton will have

43:05.114 --> 43:06.847
limited function
of his right hand

43:06.849 --> 43:08.685
for the rest of his life.

43:13.088 --> 43:14.857
That's Milton's pitching arm.

43:17.860 --> 43:20.063
For God sakes, we just
buried his father.

43:21.731 --> 43:22.366
I'm so sorry.

43:24.300 --> 43:26.166
Well Milton is
aware that he has a

43:26.168 --> 43:28.302
severe arm injury

43:28.304 --> 43:30.338
that will require
extensive rehab

43:30.340 --> 43:32.610
and most likely surgery.

43:33.909 --> 43:35.812
If you need anything,
don't hesitate.

43:37.012 --> 43:39.083
I'll see you guys in a bit.

43:44.788 --> 43:46.023
Coming
out of the coma,

43:47.190 --> 43:48.992
I knew nothing would
ever be the same.

43:50.159 --> 43:51.228
My Dad was gone.

43:52.795 --> 43:55.697
But it wasn't just his
memory that lingered.

43:55.699 --> 43:57.067
His burdens did too.

43:58.467 --> 44:00.803
And I felt their weight
pressing down on me.

44:03.139 --> 44:05.976
I figured we
could use the help.

44:27.097 --> 44:28.329
I could
never take back

44:28.331 --> 44:29.932
what happened to Mrs. Davis.

44:40.175 --> 44:44.248
And it looked like I would
never play ball again.

45:01.396 --> 45:04.333
I felt broken and worthless.

45:07.369 --> 45:10.139
I had to find a way to
keep moving forward.

45:40.436 --> 45:41.338
Any luck?

45:42.572 --> 45:44.505
I think we're gonna
need a new alternator.

45:44.507 --> 45:45.876
I don't know.

45:48.010 --> 45:50.211
I need to work on
it a little more.

45:50.213 --> 45:51.077
You've been playing
around with it

45:51.079 --> 45:52.215
for a couple days now.

45:55.150 --> 45:58.288
Milton, you can't take on
all the burdens of the farm.

46:00.489 --> 46:02.759
You have enough legal
trouble of your own.

46:10.500 --> 46:11.335
Milton.

46:14.503 --> 46:15.338
Here.

46:16.271 --> 46:17.306
Take this.

46:21.244 --> 46:22.079
What's this?

46:24.880 --> 46:28.215
That's everything
we have left.

46:28.217 --> 46:29.316
I think we owe it to Mr. Gravitt

46:29.318 --> 46:30.721
to make good on our debt.

46:34.590 --> 46:36.025
How much money is this?

46:40.463 --> 46:42.166
It's my secret stash.

46:44.266 --> 46:45.969
I kept it hidden
from your Father.

46:49.938 --> 46:52.442
What were you saving it for?

46:58.313 --> 46:59.949
When you were
about two years old,

47:04.186 --> 47:05.454
your Father took me downtown

47:09.458 --> 47:12.425
and we were window shopping.

47:12.427 --> 47:14.262
It was our anniversary

47:14.264 --> 47:16.030
and he was feeling guilty

47:16.032 --> 47:18.135
because he couldn't
buy me a nice present.

47:41.456 --> 47:42.992
Funny how life gets in the way.

47:46.396 --> 47:47.929
Your father must
have come close to

47:47.931 --> 47:51.599
saving the needed $285
about 10 times over

47:51.601 --> 47:55.239
but something more
urgent always came up.

48:16.726 --> 48:18.028
Can I help you?

48:21.731 --> 48:22.365
Just looking.

48:25.400 --> 48:26.566
This ain't the kind of place

48:26.568 --> 48:28.237
where you pop in just looking.

48:34.710 --> 48:35.913
Is Mr. Gravitt in?

48:37.313 --> 48:39.746
He is extremely busy.

48:39.748 --> 48:41.484
What'd you need to see him for?

48:46.556 --> 48:47.490
What'd you need son?

48:53.663 --> 48:54.931
You Ted's boy?

48:58.534 --> 49:01.235
What kind of business you
need to see Mr. Gravitt's for?

49:01.237 --> 49:02.439
I know he's busy, just,

49:04.239 --> 49:06.409
can you please tell him I
need five minutes of his time?

49:07.610 --> 49:08.445
Sure son.

49:10.612 --> 49:11.512
He's back in the warehouse,

49:11.514 --> 49:13.150
you go on back and see him.

49:14.250 --> 49:15.085
Thank you.

49:21.690 --> 49:22.525
Mr. Gravitt.

49:24.659 --> 49:25.494
Milton Young.

49:26.795 --> 49:27.630
Ted's son.

49:29.132 --> 49:32.365
Yes I, I know.

49:32.367 --> 49:34.438
I'm really sorry to
hear about your Father.

49:35.737 --> 49:36.572
What brings you here?

49:37.773 --> 49:40.273
The last few years been
really difficult on my family.

49:40.275 --> 49:42.075
Last couple of
years been extremely

49:42.077 --> 49:44.547
tough for the entire
community and our nation.

49:45.581 --> 49:48.115
Nobody expected the recession

49:48.117 --> 49:49.653
or the drought to
last this long.

49:51.454 --> 49:53.557
I understand my family
owes you a lot of money.

49:55.358 --> 49:56.624
I wanna make another
run on the spring crop

49:56.626 --> 49:57.458
season on the farm.

49:57.460 --> 49:58.327
I got a plan.

50:00.630 --> 50:02.298
I just want you to
at least hear me out.

50:03.666 --> 50:07.168
Spring seeds should have
been sewn two weeks ago.

50:07.170 --> 50:08.635
You've practically
missed the window.

50:08.637 --> 50:10.438
You're a little late son.

50:10.440 --> 50:11.572
Because of our crop rotation

50:11.574 --> 50:12.572
and limited planting last Fall,

50:12.574 --> 50:14.677
our soil hasn't been
this fertile in years.

50:15.844 --> 50:16.679
It's late,

50:18.815 --> 50:20.748
but it's not too late.

50:20.750 --> 50:22.416
I commend you on
having the courage

50:22.418 --> 50:24.651
to come down here and see me

50:24.653 --> 50:26.655
and wanting to fight
for your families farm.

50:27.856 --> 50:29.425
Your father would be proud.

50:30.760 --> 50:32.229
I need seed and fertilizer.

50:34.463 --> 50:36.532
You want to buy
seed and fertilizer?

50:44.106 --> 50:45.775
This is everything
we have left.

51:07.762 --> 51:08.798
How much is this?

51:10.199 --> 51:10.834
Almost 200.

51:14.137 --> 51:17.438
Son, your family owes
me thousands of dollars.

51:17.440 --> 51:18.771
This is short.

51:18.773 --> 51:20.173
I mean given our
current situation

51:20.175 --> 51:21.644
we can't repay the debt.

51:23.512 --> 51:25.378
I can sit back and do nothing

51:25.380 --> 51:26.746
the bank will eventually
take over the farm

51:26.748 --> 51:29.585
and you'll never get repaid.

51:31.820 --> 51:33.586
I want a chance
to repay the debt.

51:33.588 --> 51:34.690
Give me a chance!

51:35.891 --> 51:37.624
I'm not a bank.

51:37.626 --> 51:40.663
I am not in the business
of lending money.

51:41.898 --> 51:45.166
The economy has taken a toll
on our business as well.

51:45.168 --> 51:47.170
We too are suffering
financially.

51:48.771 --> 51:50.204
We're in the middle
of one of the worst

51:50.206 --> 51:51.838
droughts on the record.

51:51.840 --> 51:54.474
I'm not in a position to
take that additional risk.

51:54.476 --> 51:55.846
It's nothing personal.

51:57.880 --> 51:59.112
But that would be foolish

51:59.114 --> 52:02.184
and a financially reckless
business decision on my part.

52:04.820 --> 52:06.456
I'm asking you to trust me.

52:09.724 --> 52:11.827
Have faith in Pastures
of Rose Creek Farm.

52:17.766 --> 52:19.768
What about your
legal troubles?

52:21.469 --> 52:22.705
And what about your arm?

52:24.373 --> 52:26.675
Are you able to do any
real physical labor?

52:30.679 --> 52:32.947
I'm fully prepared to face
the consequences of my actions.

52:32.949 --> 52:33.884
I know what I gotta do.

52:35.885 --> 52:36.920
As far as my arm,

52:39.222 --> 52:40.287
the doctor said that
I'm perfectly fine

52:40.289 --> 52:41.755
to work in the fields.

52:41.757 --> 52:44.758
Look, I know you're going
through a tough time right now.

52:44.760 --> 52:48.561
And again, I say I'm
sorry about your Dad.

52:48.563 --> 52:49.732
Ted was a good man.

52:52.735 --> 52:55.235
Thank you for coming
down and make a partial

52:55.237 --> 52:57.871
payment on your family's
outstanding debt.

52:57.873 --> 52:59.773
We're just not in the position

52:59.775 --> 53:01.945
to extend additional
credit or resources.

53:03.679 --> 53:04.514
Thank you.

53:06.014 --> 53:07.183
For hearing me out.

53:20.896 --> 53:21.865
Good luck Milton.

53:36.911 --> 53:38.881
I tried to delay
as long as possible.

53:39.782 --> 53:40.984
There were no other options.

53:42.284 --> 53:43.619
I'm really sorry.

54:08.077 --> 54:10.013
Hey, how've you been?

54:13.048 --> 54:14.014
I've been trying to call.

54:14.016 --> 54:16.285
Did Katherine give you
any of my messages?

54:18.086 --> 54:19.322
Hello?

54:20.422 --> 54:21.322
Why are you...

54:21.324 --> 54:22.690
Danielle, what do
you want from me?

54:22.692 --> 54:23.624
I haven't heard
from you in a while,

54:23.626 --> 54:24.557
I just wanted to check in on you

54:24.559 --> 54:25.561
and make sure you were okay.

54:27.362 --> 54:30.331
Look, I heard that
you were meeting

54:30.333 --> 54:31.764
your attorney tomorrow
and I just wanted

54:31.766 --> 54:34.303
to know if there was anything
that I could do for you?

54:37.440 --> 54:38.505
Who told you that?

54:38.507 --> 54:40.606
Why are you so upset?

54:40.608 --> 54:43.376
Did you also hear the
accident was my fault?

54:43.378 --> 54:45.714
You know, everything's
my fault, I'm a monster?

54:47.449 --> 54:48.751
Wait, Milton talk to me.

54:50.585 --> 54:52.021
I just can't figure it out.

54:53.389 --> 54:55.588
Things aren't going
real well on the farm.

54:55.590 --> 54:57.391
Things aren't going real
well in my personal life.

54:57.393 --> 54:59.362
Things aren't going
real well anywhere.

55:00.128 --> 55:01.998
There's nothing here
for you Danielle.

55:33.396 --> 55:34.464
Can I help you?

55:35.597 --> 55:36.929
I'm here to see Mrs. Davis.

55:36.931 --> 55:39.133
She's in room 330.

55:39.135 --> 55:41.467
End of the hall on your right.

55:41.469 --> 55:42.071
Thanks.

56:05.994 --> 56:07.364
How are you Mrs. Davis?

56:10.532 --> 56:11.534
It's Milton.

56:12.967 --> 56:14.069
Milton Young.

56:23.878 --> 56:26.882
I wanted to tell
you how sorry I am.

56:29.050 --> 56:32.422
I wish I could
remember what happened.

56:33.621 --> 56:35.524
I wish I could go
back and fix it.

56:40.929 --> 56:43.098
I wanna make sure you know

56:49.938 --> 56:51.407
that I'm sorry.

57:05.887 --> 57:07.720
Due to your financial hardship

57:07.722 --> 57:09.155
the state has agreed
to allow me to

57:09.157 --> 57:12.025
represent you as the
court appointed attorney.

57:12.027 --> 57:14.228
Now the state of
Georgia has charged you

57:14.230 --> 57:16.863
with aggravated
vehicular assault, DUI,

57:16.865 --> 57:18.599
and resisting arrest.

57:18.601 --> 57:20.566
Because you were 18 at time

57:20.568 --> 57:21.834
the charges were filed.

57:21.836 --> 57:24.204
The state considers
you an adult.

57:24.206 --> 57:28.108
These offenses carry a
combined 10 years in prison.

57:28.110 --> 57:30.744
It doesn't help your
case you severely injured

57:30.746 --> 57:33.679
a very well respected
member of our community.

57:33.681 --> 57:35.749
It feels like
I'm already guilty?

57:35.751 --> 57:38.050
Well, it's my job is
to put together a defense

57:38.052 --> 57:39.755
and fight the
charges against you.

57:40.822 --> 57:42.523
Now, the first thing we do

57:42.525 --> 57:44.657
is we always try to
get the charges dropped

57:44.659 --> 57:47.961
if we can find a
loophole or technicality.

57:47.963 --> 57:50.296
If we can't do that I
would then recommend

57:50.298 --> 57:52.065
negotiating with
the state solicitor

57:52.067 --> 57:55.202
to plea down the charges
to lesser offenses.

57:55.204 --> 57:58.639
Our last option, and the
one we want to avoid,

57:58.641 --> 58:01.541
is going to trial, fighting
the charges in a courtroom

58:01.543 --> 58:02.244
in front of a jury.

58:05.681 --> 58:07.583
I didn't commit
any of these crimes.

58:10.152 --> 58:11.617
Okay.

58:11.619 --> 58:12.586
Well, why don't you
give me your version

58:12.588 --> 58:15.124
of the events that
transpired on May 6th.

58:17.860 --> 58:19.825
That was the day of
my Father's funeral.

58:23.632 --> 58:25.331
I am so sorry for your loss.

58:25.333 --> 58:27.166
If there's anything
we can do for you,

58:27.168 --> 58:28.702
please let call us.

58:28.704 --> 58:29.670
Thank you.

58:29.672 --> 58:30.336
Take care.

58:30.338 --> 58:32.241
Thank you for coming.

58:45.119 --> 58:47.720
When are you going
back to college?

58:47.722 --> 58:48.625
I can't go back.

58:50.592 --> 58:53.529
Not now, there's
so much to do here.

58:54.663 --> 58:57.063
Milton, your
future is at school

58:57.065 --> 58:57.998
pursuing your dreams.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.536
Can we talk about this later?

59:01.603 --> 59:03.939
We have a few guests
coming back to the house.

59:04.940 --> 59:06.909
I just want to be alone.

59:08.777 --> 59:11.177
I'll take a ride
if you don't mind.

59:11.179 --> 59:12.244
You sure you're okay?

59:12.246 --> 59:13.081
Yeah.

59:15.217 --> 59:17.220
I need to clear my head.

59:23.992 --> 59:25.825
Hey.

59:25.827 --> 59:26.862
Hanging in there?

59:28.797 --> 59:29.632
Yeah.

59:32.900 --> 59:33.936
Look,

59:34.836 --> 59:37.306
I'm really sorry about your Dad.

59:39.007 --> 59:40.074
I finally got out of town

59:40.076 --> 59:42.211
and everything was starting
to fall into place.

59:44.913 --> 59:46.648
For once, things
were going my way.

59:47.849 --> 59:49.052
The way I've always dreamed.

59:54.657 --> 59:57.160
Now everything is so messed
up I can't think straight.

01:00:04.432 --> 01:00:05.835
Brought you something.

01:00:13.976 --> 01:00:15.742
What's this?

01:00:15.744 --> 01:00:18.010
A little something to
keep your mind off things.

01:00:18.012 --> 01:00:20.048
You know I'm not
much of a drinker bro.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:22.684
Keep it for later then.

01:00:23.985 --> 01:00:25.954
Trust me, you'll need it.

01:00:26.855 --> 01:00:28.090
Catch you around.

01:01:28.016 --> 01:01:29.349
You told me you
weren't drinking.

01:01:29.351 --> 01:01:31.217
Mom, I was telling...

01:01:31.219 --> 01:01:33.920
Mrs. Young, I'd like
to ask you to refrain

01:01:33.922 --> 01:01:35.121
from interrupting
while I'm trying

01:01:35.123 --> 01:01:38.157
to get your sons
version of the events.

01:01:38.159 --> 01:01:39.194
Milton, please continue.

01:01:40.528 --> 01:01:42.264
That's the last
thing I remember.

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:47.200
The last thing you
remember is downing liquor.

01:01:47.202 --> 01:01:50.436
I wasn't downing liquor,
I didn't even swallow.

01:01:50.438 --> 01:01:53.139
What's the next thing
that you remember?

01:01:53.141 --> 01:01:55.108
Waking up in a
hospital a week later.

01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:56.242
Let me just make sure
I've got this right.

01:01:56.244 --> 01:01:59.345
You took a sip of liquor

01:01:59.347 --> 01:02:01.817
and then woke up a week
later in the hospital?

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:05.151
That's a large gap.

01:02:05.153 --> 01:02:06.422
Resisting arrest.

01:02:08.824 --> 01:02:10.456
You're right handed?

01:02:10.458 --> 01:02:11.891
Yes ma'am.

01:02:11.893 --> 01:02:13.894
Patient suffers from
Anterograde amnesia

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:16.396
due to blunt force
trauma to head and neck.

01:02:16.398 --> 01:02:18.365
You really don't remember
anything else from that night?

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:21.200
I mean every now and
then I'll have a dream.

01:02:21.202 --> 01:02:24.204
You know, it's never
enough to piece together.

01:02:24.206 --> 01:02:27.039
I know for certain I did
not run over Mrs. Davis.

01:02:27.041 --> 01:02:28.307
You have to understand,

01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:30.209
that it's very hard
to defend a client

01:02:30.211 --> 01:02:33.146
when they can't
provide any details

01:02:33.148 --> 01:02:34.914
of the events the
night in question.

01:02:34.916 --> 01:02:36.018
Isn't that your job?

01:02:38.219 --> 01:02:40.119
This has to be very
upsetting Mrs. Young.

01:02:40.121 --> 01:02:43.155
I know this is
scary for a mother.

01:02:43.157 --> 01:02:46.258
Knowing her son is facing
these kinds of charges.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.561
I have a police report to review

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:50.063
and I have some witnesses
I need to talk to.

01:02:50.065 --> 01:02:51.565
I've still got a
lot of research.

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:53.333
And I want to assure you

01:02:53.335 --> 01:02:56.135
that I will do
everything in my power

01:02:56.137 --> 01:02:58.604
to represent your son
according to Georgia law.

01:02:58.606 --> 01:03:01.007
And it's also my
job to give advice.

01:03:01.009 --> 01:03:02.177
And my initial thoughts,

01:03:03.612 --> 01:03:06.880
this is gonna be an extremely
difficult case to defend.

01:03:06.882 --> 01:03:09.215
Now I'm encouraged
by Milton's record.

01:03:09.217 --> 01:03:11.319
It's clean, no priors.

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:14.153
And I expect our
best option would be

01:03:14.155 --> 01:03:16.088
to negotiate to lesser charges

01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:17.393
to minimize his jail time.

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:25.932
You said to
always put my trust

01:03:25.934 --> 01:03:27.870
and faith in our
Heavenly Father.

01:03:30.405 --> 01:03:32.141
He'd lead me in the
right direction.

01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:36.112
I'm so sorry Milton.

01:03:38.012 --> 01:03:40.916
I finally got out of the
town I'd worked hard to escape.

01:03:42.351 --> 01:03:44.387
Pursuing something that I
thought I was called to do.

01:03:46.387 --> 01:03:47.322
We lost Dad.

01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:50.590
We're about to lose the farm.

01:03:50.592 --> 01:03:52.191
I've got legal troubles

01:03:52.193 --> 01:03:54.163
from an accident I
don't even remember,

01:03:56.264 --> 01:03:59.335
and I'll never play baseball

01:04:01.235 --> 01:04:02.534
again.

01:04:02.536 --> 01:04:03.170
Milton.

01:04:05.641 --> 01:04:07.309
I can't imagine how you feel.

01:04:10.045 --> 01:04:11.313
Sometimes,

01:04:12.514 --> 01:04:15.250
things have a strange way
of working themselves out.

01:04:16.251 --> 01:04:17.153
It's not fair.

01:04:31.599 --> 01:04:33.333
Milton!

01:04:33.335 --> 01:04:34.400
Milton!

01:04:34.402 --> 01:04:36.001
What are you doing?

01:04:36.003 --> 01:04:36.639
Hun.

01:04:51.585 --> 01:04:54.322
But not my will
but yours be done.

01:05:09.403 --> 01:05:11.070
Can I help you?

01:05:11.072 --> 01:05:11.907
Saw the sign.

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:14.443
Y'all looking for
help around the farm.

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:18.711
I don't mean you no harm ma'am.

01:05:18.713 --> 01:05:20.615
I don't recognize
you from town.

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:23.615
I'm not from around here.

01:05:23.617 --> 01:05:24.653
Just passing through.

01:05:26.521 --> 01:05:28.090
Help is no longer needed.

01:06:21.742 --> 01:06:22.711
Can I help you?

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:25.677
I'm David.

01:06:25.679 --> 01:06:27.046
I spoke with your mother about

01:06:27.048 --> 01:06:28.748
helping out around the farm.

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:30.650
She didn't mention that to me.

01:06:30.652 --> 01:06:31.987
Good news.

01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:37.123
It turns out it wasn't
the alternator after all.

01:06:37.125 --> 01:06:39.128
Appears to have
been a loose cable.

01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:44.400
How did you know I thought
it was a bad alternator?

01:06:53.141 --> 01:06:53.773
I told
you the position

01:06:53.775 --> 01:06:54.409
is no longer needed.

01:06:56.610 --> 01:06:58.179
Get off our property mister.

01:07:00.081 --> 01:07:01.317
Should we see if she starts?

01:07:17.731 --> 01:07:19.833
Listen, I appreciate
you coming out here,

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:21.668
fixing our tractor, but,

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:23.635
my mom's right we don't

01:07:23.637 --> 01:07:25.438
need nobody right now.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:28.208
Last frost was
a few weeks back.

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:30.813
Corn and melon seeds
should of been sown by now.

01:07:32.447 --> 01:07:34.347
We really need to get work.

01:07:34.349 --> 01:07:36.182
Look, I don't
know who you talk to

01:07:36.184 --> 01:07:38.450
or what you heard around town,

01:07:38.452 --> 01:07:41.157
we're in no financial position
to be hiring day labor.

01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:44.657
Run up to the house and
grab this man a few dollars

01:07:44.659 --> 01:07:45.791
and pay him for his time.

01:07:45.793 --> 01:07:46.860
Mighty kind of you ma'am,

01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:49.496
but I'm not here for your money.

01:07:49.498 --> 01:07:51.300
I know your husband
passed recently.

01:07:53.268 --> 01:07:55.568
Milton, I know you lost complete

01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:57.137
use of your right hand

01:07:57.139 --> 01:08:00.342
and facing some
serious legal issues.

01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:03.575
I know y'all are in debt

01:08:03.577 --> 01:08:05.612
and the banks fixing to
foreclose on your farm

01:08:05.614 --> 01:08:06.615
in a few months.

01:08:08.282 --> 01:08:11.554
Unfortunately, y'all
are out of options.

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:13.855
You need me.

01:08:14.856 --> 01:08:16.589
Who sent you?

01:08:16.591 --> 01:08:19.725
I'll take 15% override
on Summers final harvest.

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:22.361
I only need one good meal a day.

01:08:22.363 --> 01:08:24.830
I reckon that barn over
yonder will do for sleeping.

01:08:24.832 --> 01:08:27.799
We're in the middle of
the worst drought on record.

01:08:27.801 --> 01:08:30.870
I mean, I just listed all
these problems we're facing,

01:08:30.872 --> 01:08:33.839
why sneak out here and fix
some random persons tractor?

01:08:33.841 --> 01:08:34.840
You just said it yourself,

01:08:34.841 --> 01:08:36.808
what good is a running tractor

01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:37.876
when we ain't got no money?

01:08:37.877 --> 01:08:39.215
No seed,

01:08:40.215 --> 01:08:41.716
fertilizer, you know, nothing.

01:08:42.582 --> 01:08:43.950
Do not worry about tomorrow,

01:08:43.952 --> 01:08:45.951
tomorrow will
worry about itself.

01:08:45.953 --> 01:08:48.888
Each new day has got
enough trouble of its own.

01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:50.255
Why would anyone
risk something like

01:08:50.256 --> 01:08:52.858
that with such little reward?

01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:54.194
You don't even know us.

01:08:55.395 --> 01:08:57.496
I've got something you don't.

01:08:57.497 --> 01:08:59.365
What would that be?

01:08:59.367 --> 01:09:00.202
Hope.

01:09:02.237 --> 01:09:03.139
We got a deal?

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:19.220
Got a deal.

01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:25.558
Thank you for believing in me.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:29.228
I won't let you down.

01:10:23.784 --> 01:10:26.287
You two are making progress.

01:10:27.521 --> 01:10:30.055
Well the soil was
in great condition.

01:10:30.057 --> 01:10:31.891
And we've been fortunate too.

01:10:31.893 --> 01:10:33.826
The equipment's holding up.

01:10:33.828 --> 01:10:34.630
God is good.

01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:36.832
Yes He is.

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:39.965
All the time.

01:10:39.967 --> 01:10:43.404
Kinda hard to
believe that sometimes.

01:10:46.807 --> 01:10:50.311
Well, I know what
it is to be in need.

01:10:51.345 --> 01:10:54.347
And I know what it
is to have plenty.

01:10:54.349 --> 01:10:56.482
I've learned the
secret to happiness

01:10:56.484 --> 01:10:58.320
is to be content

01:10:59.087 --> 01:11:01.323
in every and any situation.

01:11:05.793 --> 01:11:07.326
It's getting late.

01:11:07.328 --> 01:11:08.930
I'm gonna turn in for the night.

01:11:10.631 --> 01:11:12.701
Thank you for the
meal, it was wonderful.

01:11:15.036 --> 01:11:16.372
We have a big day tomorrow.

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:02.818
You were awesome.

01:12:06.421 --> 01:12:07.423
I'm doing my best.

01:12:09.591 --> 01:12:10.659
Yeah, you're the one

01:12:11.792 --> 01:12:13.561
who's really helping.

01:12:17.131 --> 01:12:17.965
Now what?

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.537
Our work is done for now.

01:12:22.703 --> 01:12:27.475
Now we wait
patiently and listen.

01:12:29.743 --> 01:12:30.578
Wait for what?

01:12:35.449 --> 01:12:37.884
You have not been ignored

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:41.120
or forgotten.

01:12:41.122 --> 01:12:42.958
You didn't choose Him,

01:12:43.957 --> 01:12:45.059
He chose you.

01:13:02.543 --> 01:13:03.144
David!

01:13:15.622 --> 01:13:16.457
David!

01:14:03.136 --> 01:14:04.773
Good evening sir.

01:14:06.039 --> 01:14:07.839
What ya doing here?

01:14:07.841 --> 01:14:10.812
I haven't slept since you
left the store a few weeks ago.

01:14:14.248 --> 01:14:15.113
Ma'am.

01:14:15.115 --> 01:14:15.951
Mr. Gravitt.

01:14:17.685 --> 01:14:20.456
My wife and I have been
thinking about what you said.

01:14:22.289 --> 01:14:24.123
We've been doing
business with your family

01:14:24.125 --> 01:14:25.694
for over 50 years.

01:14:26.627 --> 01:14:29.695
Your father was always
a man of his word.

01:14:29.697 --> 01:14:31.733
We thought about what
you said and we prayed.

01:14:32.667 --> 01:14:33.836
We wanna help.

01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:45.777
You gotta be kidding me.

01:14:45.779 --> 01:14:46.814
We believe in you.

01:14:48.181 --> 01:14:50.985
And Pastures of Rose Creek Farm.

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:01.229
Oh yeah, yeah.

01:15:17.244 --> 01:15:18.945
With David's
help, I began to believe

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:21.147
we would find our way through.

01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:23.281
Maybe I'd never be happy here,

01:15:23.283 --> 01:15:24.983
but we could survive.

01:15:24.985 --> 01:15:27.285
And I could be
grateful for that.

01:15:27.287 --> 01:15:29.321
Maybe being grateful
would be enough.

01:15:31.024 --> 01:15:32.692
I couldn't help
but think of my Dad

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:34.830
and wonder why that hadn't
been enough for him.

01:15:36.898 --> 01:15:38.900
But my Dad's burdens
would have to wait.

01:15:39.833 --> 01:15:40.903
I had my own.

01:15:48.376 --> 01:15:49.744
Afternoon Milton.

01:15:50.612 --> 01:15:52.146
We're here about Mrs. Davis.

01:15:53.847 --> 01:15:54.681
Is Mrs. Davis okay?

01:15:56.317 --> 01:15:59.688
Mrs. Davis passed
on this morning.

01:16:00.887 --> 01:16:02.687
I thought she
was doing better.

01:16:02.689 --> 01:16:05.594
Overnight she took
a turn for the worse.

01:16:08.997 --> 01:16:13.833
The DA's upgrading the
charges pending against you

01:16:13.835 --> 01:16:15.002
to vehicular manslaughter.

01:16:16.037 --> 01:16:17.639
You're under arrest Milton.

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:21.143
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:16:22.275 --> 01:16:23.241
Anything you say
can and will be used

01:16:23.243 --> 01:16:25.644
against you in the court of law.

01:16:25.646 --> 01:16:27.178
You have the right
to an attorney,

01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:28.748
if you can't afford one,

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:30.851
one will be provided
for you at no cost.

01:16:32.286 --> 01:16:35.655
You understand these rights
as I've explained 'em to you?

01:16:35.657 --> 01:16:36.291
Yes sir.

01:16:37.391 --> 01:16:42.597
All right, let's go bro.

01:16:55.710 --> 01:16:56.345
Come on.

01:16:57.377 --> 01:16:58.212
We're right here.

01:17:03.083 --> 01:17:03.918
Turn around.

01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:07.055
Watch your head.

01:17:29.077 --> 01:17:31.713
Place your left hand on the
monitor, fingers together.

01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:35.347
Hold it.

01:19:44.045 --> 01:19:46.211
It's okay Jackie,

01:19:46.213 --> 01:19:47.882
Rachel will be fine.

01:19:56.189 --> 01:19:57.259
Visiting an inmate?

01:19:58.426 --> 01:19:59.357
Yes sir.

01:19:59.359 --> 01:20:00.295
Do you have an appointment?

01:20:01.529 --> 01:20:02.364
No sir.

01:20:04.398 --> 01:20:05.367
Who are you here to see?

01:20:07.368 --> 01:20:08.567
Milton Young.

01:20:08.569 --> 01:20:11.437
We really recommend making
appointments in advance.

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:12.274
My apologies.

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:14.475
First time visitor.

01:20:18.311 --> 01:20:20.881
You have any weapons
or sharp objects on you?

01:20:22.115 --> 01:20:23.182
No sir.

01:20:23.184 --> 01:20:24.452
Relationship to the inmate?

01:20:25.353 --> 01:20:26.387
Friend.

01:20:28.355 --> 01:20:29.287
Yeah, I need you to fill out

01:20:29.289 --> 01:20:31.223
this visitor information on top

01:20:31.225 --> 01:20:33.328
and I need a form of
government issued ID.

01:20:53.447 --> 01:20:54.679
How ya holding up?

01:20:54.681 --> 01:20:56.117
Hanging in there.

01:20:59.353 --> 01:21:00.154
How's Mom doing?

01:21:01.221 --> 01:21:02.489
She's doing all right.

01:21:05.259 --> 01:21:07.028
They say anything
about your court date?

01:21:09.529 --> 01:21:11.465
My attorney said
she needs more time.

01:21:16.369 --> 01:21:18.036
Heard the news this morning.

01:21:18.038 --> 01:21:20.041
Rainfall's up eight
inches for the year.

01:21:21.676 --> 01:21:23.912
Some saying possible
bumper crops though.

01:21:25.512 --> 01:21:26.547
At least that's good.

01:21:29.449 --> 01:21:30.551
Off to a good start.

01:21:36.222 --> 01:21:37.057
Excuse me.

01:21:44.064 --> 01:21:45.296
Hey!

01:22:05.086 --> 01:22:07.255
I brought you something.

01:24:08.676 --> 01:24:10.812
Driver, place your
hands outside the vehicle.

01:24:17.818 --> 01:24:19.654
Let me see your license son.

01:24:29.563 --> 01:24:31.231
You stay right here.

01:24:43.543 --> 01:24:44.612
Milton Young.

01:24:48.815 --> 01:24:50.085
Milton Young.

01:25:06.867 --> 01:25:08.369
Come on, get out of the truck.

01:25:15.242 --> 01:25:16.043
Put your hands on the vehicle.

01:25:19.646 --> 01:25:21.115
Was I doing
something wrong sir?

01:25:22.416 --> 01:25:23.585
We're gonna find out.

01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:37.862
What's this about?

01:25:37.864 --> 01:25:39.399
I'm gonna place
you in handcuffs son.

01:25:40.634 --> 01:25:41.799
For your safety and for mine

01:25:41.801 --> 01:25:43.871
when I inspect
your vehicle, okay.

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:56.214
Oh, oh, oh, look at
what we got here.

01:25:56.216 --> 01:25:56.917
Mm, mm, mm.

01:25:58.418 --> 01:26:00.952
Pretty young to be
drinking ain't you son?

01:26:00.954 --> 01:26:02.021
Looks like I'm gonna have to add

01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:04.488
driving under the
influence on alcohol huh?

01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:05.424
I didn't drink it!

01:26:05.426 --> 01:26:07.226
Hey!

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:08.429
Don't you resist!

01:26:13.466 --> 01:26:15.903
Hey, you play fall ball, hm?

01:26:17.304 --> 01:26:17.936
Yes sir.

01:26:17.938 --> 01:26:19.173
Coach Dooley?

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:20.775
Yes sir.

01:26:22.342 --> 01:26:23.912
Come for my Dad's funeral.

01:26:25.511 --> 01:26:26.914
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:26:28.582 --> 01:26:30.318
So you're the hot shot huh?

01:26:33.253 --> 01:26:35.286
I'm not sure what you mean.

01:26:35.288 --> 01:26:35.923
Oh no?

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.826
You killed my son.

01:26:41.828 --> 01:26:43.831
I didn't kill anybody.

01:26:44.931 --> 01:26:46.600
You killed my son!

01:27:00.814 --> 01:27:01.746
Come on, get up.

01:27:01.748 --> 01:27:02.813
I ain't through with you yet.

01:27:02.815 --> 01:27:04.284
Come on, get up.

01:27:05.752 --> 01:27:07.385
We gonna take a
little joyride boy.

01:27:07.387 --> 01:27:08.320
Huh?

01:27:34.081 --> 01:27:36.481
One more, one more time!

01:27:36.483 --> 01:27:37.949
Come on boy!

01:27:37.951 --> 01:27:38.886
Here we go!

01:27:41.087 --> 01:27:42.086
Woo!

01:27:42.088 --> 01:27:43.487
Woo!

01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:22.630
What have you done?

01:28:28.801 --> 01:28:30.505
It's your fault!

01:28:31.671 --> 01:28:34.138
You made me do this!

01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:35.643
You made me do it!

01:29:49.583 --> 01:29:52.116
Come on, we gotta
get this door open!

01:29:52.118 --> 01:29:52.918
Let's go!

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:53.755
Door open now!

01:29:58.859 --> 01:30:00.858
We have a visitor
unaccounted for.

01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:01.695
Where'd he go?

01:30:03.130 --> 01:30:04.062
The guy sitting right here,

01:30:04.064 --> 01:30:05.062
where did he go?

01:30:05.064 --> 01:30:06.433
I gotta see Sheriff Darden.

01:30:07.734 --> 01:30:08.834
Where is he?

01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:10.067
Where is the other guy!

01:30:10.069 --> 01:30:11.602
Get Sheriff, I
know what happened

01:30:11.604 --> 01:30:12.870
the night of the accident.

01:30:12.872 --> 01:30:13.804
Okay, I don't have
time for this game.

01:30:13.806 --> 01:30:15.005
Let's go!

01:30:15.007 --> 01:30:15.674
I didn't
kill Mrs. Davis.

01:30:15.676 --> 01:30:16.511
Relax!

01:30:25.185 --> 01:30:27.218
What in the heck is going on?

01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:28.719
I'm not sure Sheriff.

01:30:28.721 --> 01:30:30.655
What do you mean "not sure."

01:30:30.657 --> 01:30:31.623
All the inmates
are accounted for.

01:30:31.625 --> 01:30:33.090
Who ordered the lockdown?

01:30:33.092 --> 01:30:34.759
We lost power
in the main jail,

01:30:34.761 --> 01:30:35.861
the backup generators failed.

01:30:35.863 --> 01:30:37.495
What was the cause?

01:30:37.497 --> 01:30:39.000
Appears to have started
in the visitor area.

01:30:40.167 --> 01:30:42.267
Was anybody in
there at the time?

01:30:42.269 --> 01:30:43.602
Milton and a visitor.

01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:44.803
Several lights exploded

01:30:44.805 --> 01:30:46.705
and there was a
small electrical fire

01:30:46.707 --> 01:30:47.608
that broke out as well.

01:30:48.708 --> 01:30:50.541
Get the surveillance video.

01:30:50.543 --> 01:30:52.113
I'm trying to get
that up now sir.

01:31:01.654 --> 01:31:06.560
Milton.

01:31:09.896 --> 01:31:11.595
Where did your little friend

01:31:11.597 --> 01:31:13.231
magically disappear to?

01:31:13.233 --> 01:31:14.165
Sheriff I know what happened

01:31:14.167 --> 01:31:16.601
the night of the accident.

01:31:16.603 --> 01:31:19.739
I was not driving the truck
when Mrs. Davis got ran over.

01:31:20.707 --> 01:31:21.843
Are you feeling okay?

01:31:22.975 --> 01:31:24.744
I wasn't drinking
alcohol either.

01:31:26.779 --> 01:31:27.814
I was set up.

01:31:29.815 --> 01:31:30.851
Who set you up?

01:31:36.055 --> 01:31:38.859
Deputy Jones
killed Mrs. Davis.

01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:42.762
Deputy Jones set you up?

01:31:44.197 --> 01:31:46.868
He stopped me in the park
the day of my Fathers funeral.

01:31:49.202 --> 01:31:51.873
He told me I killed
his son Ryan.

01:31:53.873 --> 01:31:56.875
Deputy Jones
driving your truck.

01:31:56.877 --> 01:31:58.009
Well after he
ran over Mrs. Davis

01:31:58.011 --> 01:31:59.777
he knocked me unconscious.

01:31:59.779 --> 01:32:00.911
Look, Milton I know it's been

01:32:00.913 --> 01:32:03.583
a little exciting around here,

01:32:04.717 --> 01:32:07.085
but I wanna get you
checked out by medical.

01:32:07.087 --> 01:32:08.753
I'm not just making stuff
up trying to get out of here.

01:32:08.755 --> 01:32:10.257
This is the truth.

01:32:13.126 --> 01:32:14.862
You gotta believe me.

01:32:16.863 --> 01:32:17.698
Sure.

01:32:18.798 --> 01:32:19.966
I believe you.

01:32:37.984 --> 01:32:39.084
Sheriff.

01:32:39.086 --> 01:32:40.887
You might wanna
take a look at this.

01:32:44.123 --> 01:32:44.958
What you got?

01:32:49.229 --> 01:32:51.329
We lost all video
on every backup.

01:32:51.331 --> 01:32:53.365
Something caused a
massive electrical surge.

01:32:53.367 --> 01:32:58.573
What about the
front entrance camera?

01:32:59.139 --> 01:33:00.104
Wait a minute.

01:33:00.106 --> 01:33:01.042
Rewind, rewind camera two.

01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:04.009
I think we've been
having some problems

01:33:04.011 --> 01:33:04.946
with that one lately.

01:33:05.947 --> 01:33:08.013
What about the front
front outside camera?

01:33:08.015 --> 01:33:10.080
Any footage of the
visitor leaving?

01:33:10.082 --> 01:33:11.085
Let's take a look.

01:33:14.253 --> 01:33:15.655
Camera's working fine.

01:33:16.823 --> 01:33:18.889
No footage of the
visitor exiting.

01:33:27.701 --> 01:33:28.333
Morning Sheriff.

01:33:28.335 --> 01:33:30.067
Good morning.

01:33:30.069 --> 01:33:33.071
Had a little incident down
at the jail the other day.

01:33:33.073 --> 01:33:35.072
Is Milton okay?

01:33:35.074 --> 01:33:37.208
Yeah, Milton's
fine, he's fine.

01:33:37.210 --> 01:33:40.745
What can you tell me
about this drifter

01:33:40.747 --> 01:33:41.682
named David?

01:33:42.882 --> 01:33:45.819
We hired him to do some
day labor around the farm.

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:48.919
Haven't seen him
in a couple days.

01:33:48.921 --> 01:33:51.955
He just kinda does
his own thing.

01:33:51.957 --> 01:33:53.825
Now where does he stay?

01:33:53.827 --> 01:33:55.329
He stays over
there in the barn.

01:33:57.197 --> 01:33:58.833
Did David do something wrong?

01:34:00.167 --> 01:34:03.334
No, no I just need
to speak with him.

01:34:03.336 --> 01:34:04.672
Okay if I take a look around?

01:34:05.706 --> 01:34:06.974
Make yourself at home.

01:34:08.408 --> 01:34:09.410
All right.

01:35:25.318 --> 01:35:26.483
What can I do for ya?

01:35:26.485 --> 01:35:27.320
Doc.

01:35:28.322 --> 01:35:32.223
I must've gone through
this report 100 times.

01:35:32.225 --> 01:35:33.290
For the life of me
I can't put my hands

01:35:33.292 --> 01:35:34.994
on the toxicology results.

01:35:36.462 --> 01:35:38.064
I know we put 'em in here.

01:35:38.998 --> 01:35:39.830
This is strange.

01:35:39.832 --> 01:35:40.467
I agree.

01:35:41.501 --> 01:35:42.503
Very strange.

01:35:43.837 --> 01:35:45.102
It's a simple fix.

01:35:45.104 --> 01:35:46.071
I'll call down and
get another copy.

01:35:46.073 --> 01:35:48.138
Want me to call you
with the results first?

01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:49.174
Would you do that for me?

01:35:49.176 --> 01:35:50.340
Absolutely.

01:35:50.342 --> 01:35:51.175
Thanks Doc.

01:35:51.177 --> 01:35:52.410
You got it.

01:35:52.412 --> 01:35:53.280
Have a good day
Sheriff, be safe.

01:36:02.588 --> 01:36:05.158
Sheriff Darden, Dr.
Adams on the phone.

01:36:06.926 --> 01:36:08.358
Yeah, Darden here.

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.294
Just wanted to let you know

01:36:09.296 --> 01:36:10.861
I got those results back.

01:36:10.863 --> 01:36:12.362
Toxicology came back clean.

01:36:12.364 --> 01:36:15.066
No signs of alcohol or any
other controlled substances.

01:36:15.068 --> 01:36:17.535
Is that right?

01:36:17.537 --> 01:36:19.236
You sure about that?

01:36:19.238 --> 01:36:20.504
Yeah, you'll have a copy of
the full report by tomorrow.

01:36:20.506 --> 01:36:23.508
Any other questions,
don't hesitate to call.

01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:24.875
Okay.

01:36:24.877 --> 01:36:26.277
Okay.

01:36:26.279 --> 01:36:27.477
Thank you.

01:36:27.479 --> 01:36:29.382
Yeah, take care Doc, bye.

01:36:30.216 --> 01:36:32.317
Is everything
okay Sheriff?

01:36:32.319 --> 01:36:33.354
Mm hm.

01:36:38.992 --> 01:36:40.424
You wanted to meet?

01:36:40.426 --> 01:36:41.060
Have a seat.

01:36:43.296 --> 01:36:45.162
Preparation for Milton's trial,

01:36:45.164 --> 01:36:46.964
we need to review
this police report

01:36:46.966 --> 01:36:48.465
on Milton's accident.

01:36:48.467 --> 01:36:50.268
Making sure we're ready.

01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:51.104
Sure.

01:36:52.271 --> 01:36:54.908
I need our report
to be air tight.

01:36:56.076 --> 01:36:58.142
Well, everything you
need is right there.

01:36:58.144 --> 01:36:59.579
I've double and
triple checked it.

01:37:01.014 --> 01:37:02.115
That's my concern.

01:37:03.416 --> 01:37:06.287
I've noticed some
inconsistencies.

01:37:07.921 --> 01:37:11.258
In fact, it appears sloppy.

01:37:12.958 --> 01:37:15.660
Well, likely just
a simple oversight.

01:37:15.662 --> 01:37:16.864
Clear up real quick.

01:37:18.064 --> 01:37:18.899
Let me see it.

01:37:24.003 --> 01:37:26.970
Did I forget to fill that in?

01:37:26.972 --> 01:37:29.440
There's no mention
of a sobriety test?

01:37:29.442 --> 01:37:31.145
Innocent little mistake huh?

01:37:33.246 --> 01:37:34.478
You saw the liquor
bottle in the photos

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:36.317
and he smelled like a brewery.

01:37:39.118 --> 01:37:40.621
I'm gonna ask
you one more time.

01:37:42.021 --> 01:37:44.155
Did you administer a
breathalyzer at the

01:37:44.157 --> 01:37:45.359
time you detained Milton?

01:37:47.493 --> 01:37:49.195
Well Milton was belligerent.

01:37:50.329 --> 01:37:53.067
He was combative and
then he resisted arrest.

01:37:54.501 --> 01:37:56.668
And then he fled the scene so
I was unable to administer...

01:37:56.670 --> 01:37:58.602
Milton fled?

01:37:58.604 --> 01:38:00.604
Yes, he fled the
scene in his truck

01:38:00.606 --> 01:38:05.009
and then he hit Mrs. Davis
and then eventually wrecked.

01:38:05.011 --> 01:38:06.544
All the crime scene corroborates

01:38:06.546 --> 01:38:07.978
that this is exactly
what happened

01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:10.580
so let me just fill
out the report Sheriff

01:38:10.582 --> 01:38:11.581
and we'll move on okay?

01:38:11.583 --> 01:38:13.384
If you were unable to
administer the proper

01:38:13.386 --> 01:38:14.588
test in the field,

01:38:15.822 --> 01:38:19.393
why didn't you ask for blood
tests once at the hospital?

01:38:25.265 --> 01:38:26.531
You know what Sheriff,

01:38:26.533 --> 01:38:28.165
I don't know what
you're driving at,

01:38:28.167 --> 01:38:29.968
but I got 17 years
exemplary service

01:38:29.970 --> 01:38:31.468
and I'm not about to have some

01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:34.004
hillbilly country bumpkin
question my report

01:38:34.006 --> 01:38:35.440
and my investigation.

01:38:35.442 --> 01:38:37.442
How do you expect the
prosecution to convict Milton

01:38:37.444 --> 01:38:40.577
if you cannot prove
beyond a reasonable doubt

01:38:40.579 --> 01:38:41.614
that he was intoxicated?

01:38:47.487 --> 01:38:51.155
We had samples
tested in the lab.

01:38:51.157 --> 01:38:54.595
Milton's blood alcohol
level was 0.00.

01:38:56.429 --> 01:38:58.161
Milton fled the
scene all right.

01:38:58.163 --> 01:38:59.397
And he killed someone.

01:38:59.399 --> 01:39:00.630
That's what this
is really about.

01:39:00.632 --> 01:39:01.531
You sure that's
how it happened?

01:39:01.533 --> 01:39:03.369
Milton killed
an innocent woman!

01:39:05.438 --> 01:39:08.975
Is this your son?

01:39:19.386 --> 01:39:21.455
Milton's responsible
for my sons death.

01:39:22.322 --> 01:39:23.157
Deputy Jones,

01:39:26.059 --> 01:39:27.290
you're under arrest.

01:39:27.292 --> 01:39:28.526
Milton's gotta pay for
what he did to my son!

01:39:28.528 --> 01:39:29.527
Leave your
weapon on my desk.

01:39:29.529 --> 01:39:30.460
You can't do this!

01:39:30.462 --> 01:39:35.368
Place your weapon on the desk!

01:39:44.810 --> 01:39:46.744
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:39:46.746 --> 01:39:47.678
Anything you say
can and will be used

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:50.514
against you in a court of law.

01:39:50.516 --> 01:39:52.750
You have the right to attorney,

01:39:52.752 --> 01:39:54.518
if you cannot afford one,

01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:56.122
one will be appointed to you.

01:39:57.756 --> 01:39:58.725
Deputies!

01:40:04.797 --> 01:40:05.631
Milton.

01:40:08.701 --> 01:40:10.471
Lab results came back.

01:40:12.671 --> 01:40:14.805
You're being released.

01:40:14.807 --> 01:40:15.641
Immediately.

01:40:16.842 --> 01:40:18.345
All charges dropped.

01:40:20.246 --> 01:40:21.648
Thank the Lord.

01:40:23.783 --> 01:40:27.154
I still wanna
talk to your friend.

01:40:28.555 --> 01:40:29.719
About the little incident

01:40:29.721 --> 01:40:31.625
here at the jail house.

01:40:32.759 --> 01:40:33.761
Yes sir.

01:40:35.728 --> 01:40:36.563
You know the way.

01:40:42.601 --> 01:40:43.804
Hi!

01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:50.708
Are you okay?

01:40:50.710 --> 01:40:51.576
I'm fine.

01:40:51.578 --> 01:40:53.811
Oh well you look good.

01:40:53.813 --> 01:40:55.481
Let's get you out of here.

01:40:56.882 --> 01:40:58.382
So Sheriff Darden
stopped by a couple times

01:40:58.384 --> 01:40:59.549
looking for David,

01:40:59.551 --> 01:41:01.451
said there was a
disturbance at the jail?

01:41:01.453 --> 01:41:02.352
Yeah, it was
like a power surge

01:41:02.354 --> 01:41:03.387
or something like that.

01:41:03.389 --> 01:41:04.254
There was a storm.

01:41:04.256 --> 01:41:04.856
That's strange.

01:41:04.858 --> 01:41:06.257
I know.

01:41:06.259 --> 01:41:09.192
David just left,
didn't say goodbye?

01:41:09.194 --> 01:41:10.594
Didn't leave a note?

01:41:10.596 --> 01:41:11.431
Nothing.

01:41:12.798 --> 01:41:14.866
All right, let's
get you out of here.

01:41:14.868 --> 01:41:16.403
I've got something to show you!

01:41:33.619 --> 01:41:34.852
David had tried to show me

01:41:34.854 --> 01:41:36.853
that the seeds of hope
are far more fertile

01:41:36.855 --> 01:41:38.257
than the seeds of doubt.

01:41:39.458 --> 01:41:41.528
And staring out at our
once barren fields,

01:41:42.795 --> 01:41:44.864
I had never been more
sure that was true.

01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:52.303
I only wish I had the chance

01:41:52.305 --> 01:41:54.341
to thank him for all he'd done.

01:41:55.608 --> 01:41:56.643
And to say goodbye.

01:41:58.177 --> 01:41:59.210
How ya doing?

01:41:59.212 --> 01:42:01.745
I'm doing just
fine, thank you.

01:42:01.747 --> 01:42:04.648
You know, I've been coming
here since I was a kid.

01:42:04.650 --> 01:42:06.851
Don't think I've ever
seen it this abundant.

01:42:06.853 --> 01:42:07.751
Yes ma'am.

01:42:07.753 --> 01:42:10.588
I mean we truly
have been blessed.

01:42:10.590 --> 01:42:11.425
Truly.

01:42:12.591 --> 01:42:14.694
That'll be $24 please.

01:42:16.563 --> 01:42:17.396
45, 46,

01:42:19.231 --> 01:42:19.867
47,

01:42:22.467 --> 01:42:23.302
48, 49.

01:42:28.207 --> 01:42:29.509
This is amazing.

01:42:30.976 --> 01:42:33.910
52, 53,

01:42:33.912 --> 01:42:34.747
54,

01:42:36.582 --> 01:42:37.416
55.

01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:52.266
It's there.

01:42:53.966 --> 01:42:54.800
It's all there.

01:42:56.935 --> 01:42:57.804
Are you serious?

01:42:59.271 --> 01:43:02.240
Enough to cover the tax bill.

01:43:02.242 --> 01:43:03.409
The seed, the fertilizer.

01:43:04.543 --> 01:43:05.412
The mortgage?

01:43:06.845 --> 01:43:07.680
Ma!

01:43:19.324 --> 01:43:21.260
Katherine!

01:43:22.595 --> 01:43:23.427
Oh my God!

01:43:23.429 --> 01:43:24.262
Is everything okay?

01:43:24.264 --> 01:43:25.295
It's Milton!

01:43:25.297 --> 01:43:25.996
Is Milton hurt!

01:43:25.998 --> 01:43:26.832
Come on!

01:43:28.635 --> 01:43:29.467
Hold on!

01:43:29.469 --> 01:43:30.671
Leave it, we gotta go!

01:43:32.305 --> 01:43:32.940
Come on!

01:43:40.712 --> 01:43:41.547
Surprise!

01:43:43.048 --> 01:43:44.751
Come on, let's go!

01:43:55.528 --> 01:43:56.760
My Dad never got to ride

01:43:56.762 --> 01:43:59.362
in that hot air balloon
when he was alive,

01:43:59.364 --> 01:44:02.700
but up there, a thousand
feet in the air,

01:44:02.702 --> 01:44:05.739
my Mom and I, we
felt his presence.

01:44:07.006 --> 01:44:09.876
Together, we
released his burdens.

01:44:10.842 --> 01:44:12.710
Every one of them.

01:44:12.712 --> 01:44:14.314
And we never felt so free.

01:44:24.890 --> 01:44:27.325
God, you scared me?

01:44:27.327 --> 01:44:28.358
Where have you been?

01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:29.626
Is everything okay?

01:44:29.628 --> 01:44:31.329
We've been worried.

01:44:31.331 --> 01:44:32.296
I'm fine.

01:44:32.298 --> 01:44:34.531
Just have to tend to
a few other things.

01:44:34.533 --> 01:44:35.768
You didn't say goodbye.

01:44:39.372 --> 01:44:41.571
Looks like your
prayers are answered.

01:44:41.573 --> 01:44:42.608
Yes they have.

01:44:44.644 --> 01:44:47.280
I mean, I've never seen
anything like this before.

01:44:48.113 --> 01:44:49.080
I never got to thank you.

01:44:49.082 --> 01:44:52.049
This was not possible
without your help.

01:44:52.051 --> 01:44:52.919
You're welcome.

01:44:55.488 --> 01:44:57.490
I was wondering if you ever
come back for your money.

01:44:58.358 --> 01:45:00.991
Keep it, it's your money.

01:45:00.993 --> 01:45:04.027
No, we had an agreement.

01:45:04.029 --> 01:45:05.631
I was never here
for the money.

01:45:06.765 --> 01:45:07.867
Why'd you come back?

01:45:08.935 --> 01:45:10.037
Unfinished business.

01:45:57.649 --> 01:45:59.416
David once
told me that the secret

01:45:59.418 --> 01:46:01.552
to happiness is to be content,

01:46:01.554 --> 01:46:02.722
no matter your situation.

01:46:08.461 --> 01:46:09.660
I don't know if I'll end up

01:46:09.662 --> 01:46:11.530
working on the farm
like my dad did,

01:46:15.435 --> 01:46:16.634
or playing in the Majors

01:46:16.636 --> 01:46:18.505
and finding my way
into the Hall of Fame.

01:46:21.006 --> 01:46:23.540
What I do know, is that my life

01:46:23.542 --> 01:46:25.644
isn't going to make me happy.

01:46:31.583 --> 01:46:35.152
My happiness is going
to make my life.

01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:57.040
