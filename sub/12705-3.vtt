WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.403
(indistinct chatter)

00:11.412 --> 00:12.813
I'm giddy.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.714
Oh, I like you giddy.
Always have.

00:14.747 --> 00:16.317
It's the freedom.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.353
As seniors, we can go
off campus now for lunch.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.922
It's no longer cutting.
It's legal.

00:21.954 --> 00:23.890
Heck, it's expected.

00:23.923 --> 00:26.327
Oh, it's also
a big step forward,

00:26.359 --> 00:27.561
a senior moment,

00:27.594 --> 00:29.896
one that has
to be savored.

00:29.929 --> 00:32.066
You can't just rush
into this, you know?

00:32.100 --> 00:33.500
Ohh!

00:33.533 --> 00:34.734
No, I can't.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.670
You can.
See, you are.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.905
Oh, but, no, what if
they change the rule
without telling?

00:38.939 --> 00:42.076
What if they're lying
in wait to arrest me and...

00:42.109 --> 00:44.911
and throw me in detention and
mar my unblemished record?

00:44.945 --> 00:46.914
Breathe. Breathe.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.749
Okay. Hmm...

00:48.781 --> 00:51.351
This is good. This is...

00:51.384 --> 00:52.753
Hey, we're seniors.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.954
Hey, I'm walking here!

00:54.987 --> 00:56.590
(giggles) Ahh.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.792
XANDER:
Ah, Buffy and food.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.630
Maybe we shouldn't be
too couple-y around Buffy.

01:02.662 --> 01:04.531
Oh, you mean 'cause
of how the only guy
that ever liked her

01:04.563 --> 01:05.932
turned into
a vicious killer

01:05.965 --> 01:07.935
and had to be
put down like a dog?

01:07.968 --> 01:10.370
Can she cram
complex issues into
a nutshell, or what?

01:10.403 --> 01:12.439
All right, prepare
to uncouple...

01:12.472 --> 01:13.774
Uncouple.

01:16.810 --> 01:20.213
Buffy, banned
from campus, but not
from our hearts,

01:20.248 --> 01:21.981
how are you and
what's for lunch?

01:22.015 --> 01:23.950
Oh, I just threw
a few things together.

01:23.984 --> 01:26.052
When did you become
Martha Stewart?

01:26.085 --> 01:27.754
First of all,
MarthaStewart knows jack

01:27.787 --> 01:29.055
about hand-cut prosciutto.

01:29.088 --> 01:30.957
I don't believe
she slays, either.

01:30.990 --> 01:33.627
Oh, I hear she can,
but she doesn't like to.

01:33.661 --> 01:36.063
Second of all, way too
much free time on my hands

01:36.096 --> 01:38.165
since I got
kicked out of school.

01:38.198 --> 01:40.099
Oh, I know they'll
let you back in.
Don't you and your mom

01:40.134 --> 01:41.902
have a meeting with
Principal Snyder?

01:41.935 --> 01:43.603
We're seeing Snyd-man tomorrow.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.239
Ooh, Scott Hope at 11 o'clock.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.406
He likes you.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.609
He wanted to ask
you out last year,

01:48.641 --> 01:49.909
but you weren't
ready then.

01:49.942 --> 01:51.145
But I think
you're ready now,

01:51.179 --> 01:53.414
or at least in the state
of pre-readiness

01:53.447 --> 01:54.948
to make conversation,

01:54.981 --> 01:58.117
or to do that thing with
your mouth that boys like.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.353
Oh, I didn't mean
the bad thing with your mouth.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.923
I meant that little
half-smile thing that you...

02:02.956 --> 02:05.091
You're supposed to
stop me when I do that.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.227
I like when you do that.

02:11.998 --> 02:13.533
Hi, Buffy.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.835
Hi.

02:16.204 --> 02:18.171
I think that
went very well.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.439
Don't you think
that went very well?

02:19.473 --> 02:21.040
He didn't try to slit
our throats or anything.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.475
That's progress.

02:22.509 --> 02:24.944
Hey, did you do that
little half-smile thing?

02:24.978 --> 02:27.281
Look, I'm not trying
to snare Scott Hope.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.149
I just want to get my life back,

02:29.182 --> 02:30.651
you know, do normal stuff.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.051
Like date?

02:32.085 --> 02:33.320
Well...

02:33.353 --> 02:35.288
XANDER:
Oh, you want to date.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.191
I saw that half-smile,
you little slut.

02:37.224 --> 02:38.325
(Xander chuckles)

02:38.359 --> 02:40.828
Ha ha ha... ow.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.128
All right, yes,

02:42.162 --> 02:44.365
date and shop

02:44.397 --> 02:45.998
and hang out
and go to school

02:46.033 --> 02:48.134
and save the world
from unspeakable demons.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.837
You know, I want
to do girlie stuff.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.840
*

03:09.456 --> 03:11.191
Welcome to Happy Burger.
May I take your order, please?

03:11.224 --> 03:13.894
MAN:
Diet soda... medium.

03:13.926 --> 03:15.929
That'll be 89 cents
at the window, sir.

03:20.401 --> 03:23.170
Sunnydale.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.004
Town's got quaint.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.007
And the people?

03:27.039 --> 03:28.776
He called me "sir."

03:28.808 --> 03:30.610
Don't you just miss that?

03:30.644 --> 03:33.546
I mean, admittedly, it's not
a haven for the brothers.

03:33.581 --> 03:38.185
You know, strictly the Caucasian
persuasion here in the 'Dale.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.288
But, you know, you
just gotta stand up

03:40.320 --> 03:41.889
and salute
that death rate.

03:41.921 --> 03:44.223
I ran a statistical analysis,

03:44.258 --> 03:46.158
and hello, darkness.

03:47.661 --> 03:53.366
It makes D.C.
look like Mayberry,

03:53.401 --> 03:55.536
and ain't nobody
saying boo about it.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.771
We could fit
right in here,

03:58.805 --> 04:01.474
have us some fun.

04:01.508 --> 04:04.444
We're here for one thing.

04:06.413 --> 04:09.248
Kill the slayer, yeah.

04:09.282 --> 04:11.951
Still, big picture...

04:19.259 --> 04:20.761
Have a nice night, sir.

04:20.793 --> 04:23.096
Right back at ya.

04:23.129 --> 04:24.898
The slayer...

04:24.932 --> 04:26.733
I'm going to rip her spine

04:26.766 --> 04:27.968
from her body,

04:28.000 --> 04:29.836
then I'm going
to eat her heart

04:29.870 --> 04:32.038
and suck the marrow
from her bones.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.576
Now I'm hungry.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.244
(snarls)

04:37.276 --> 04:38.879
(screams)

04:50.824 --> 04:53.860
(wolf howling)

04:53.894 --> 04:55.995
*

05:45.612 --> 05:47.615
(romantic music plays)

05:59.427 --> 06:02.362
* Everything is quiet

06:02.396 --> 06:05.165
I miss you.

06:05.197 --> 06:08.300
* Since you're not around

06:12.473 --> 06:16.009
* And I live the numbness now

06:16.043 --> 06:18.745
* In the background

06:23.382 --> 06:26.954
* I do the things
we did before *

06:28.588 --> 06:32.593
* I walk Haight Street
to the store... *

06:37.329 --> 06:39.231
(gasps)

06:44.004 --> 06:46.139
I had to.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.348
I loved you.

07:00.019 --> 07:02.288
Oh, God, Angel...
Go to hell!

07:03.656 --> 07:06.392
(chuckling)

07:06.425 --> 07:08.928
I did.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.935
*

07:34.021 --> 07:35.355
(knock on door)

07:35.387 --> 07:38.591
Morning, sunshine.
Ready to face the beast?

07:38.625 --> 07:41.829
Here are the terms
of your re-entry, missy,

07:41.862 --> 07:43.764
take 'em or leave 'em.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.132
One: that you pass a makeup test

07:46.165 --> 07:49.603
of every class
you skipped out on last year.

07:49.637 --> 07:52.139
Two: that you provide,
in writing,

07:52.172 --> 07:54.641
one glowing letter
of recommendation

07:54.675 --> 07:58.211
from any member of our faculty
who is not an English librarian.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.646
Three:

07:59.680 --> 08:01.180
that you complete
an interview

08:01.213 --> 08:04.184
with our school psychologist

08:04.216 --> 08:08.487
who must conclude that
your violent tendencies...

08:09.990 --> 08:11.858
...are under control.

08:11.891 --> 08:14.026
I'm not sure I like
your attitude, Mr. Snyder.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.863
I spoke with the school board,
and according to them...

08:16.896 --> 08:19.667
I'm required to educate
every juvenile

08:19.699 --> 08:22.735
who is not in jail where
she belongs.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.036
Welcome back.

08:25.738 --> 08:27.641
So let me get
this straight.

08:27.675 --> 08:30.242
I'm really back in school

08:30.276 --> 08:32.078
because the school board
overruled you.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.846
Wow.

08:33.880 --> 08:37.017
That's like having your
whole ability to do this job

08:37.049 --> 08:40.486
called into question,
when you think about it.

08:40.519 --> 08:42.590
I think what my daughter's
trying to say is...

08:42.623 --> 08:45.959
* Nyah, nyah, nyah,
nyah, nyah. *

08:50.931 --> 08:53.066
(door closes, intercom buzzes)

08:53.100 --> 08:55.302
SECRETARY:
It's the mayor on line one.

08:57.437 --> 09:00.206
It's so great that you're
a schoolgirl again.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.741
Giles say
what he wanted?

09:01.774 --> 09:03.243
Do you think
he's mad?

09:03.275 --> 09:04.543
No, I don't think so.

09:04.577 --> 09:05.913
I think he just needed
to see you.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.782
Have you ever noticed,
though, when he is mad,

09:08.816 --> 09:10.850
but he's too English
to say anything,

09:10.884 --> 09:13.921
he makes that weird cluck-cluck
sound with his tongue?

09:13.953 --> 09:15.956
Hi, Giles.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.558
Oh, hi.

09:19.592 --> 09:21.028
Been there long?

09:21.061 --> 09:22.895
Buffy, good timing.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.563
I could use your help.

09:24.597 --> 09:26.734
I trust you remember
the demon Acathla?

09:26.767 --> 09:28.701
Giles, contain yourself.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.037
Yes, I'm back in school,

09:30.070 --> 09:31.871
but you know how it
embarrasses me

09:31.904 --> 09:33.706
when you gush so.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.274
Let's just skip all that and get
straight to work.

09:35.307 --> 09:37.144
Oh, uh...

09:37.177 --> 09:39.712
Well, I, um...

09:39.746 --> 09:43.082
W-w-well, of course,
it's wonderful to have you back.

09:43.115 --> 09:44.317
That goes without saying.

09:44.350 --> 09:46.418
But...

09:46.452 --> 09:49.756
you enjoy making me
say it, don't you?

09:49.789 --> 09:51.892
Okay, Acathla, huh?

09:51.924 --> 09:53.927
What are you doing,
making him some demon pizza?

09:53.961 --> 09:56.929
We need to make sure
that he remains dormant

09:56.963 --> 10:00.133
and that the dimensional
vortex is sealed tight.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.934
So I'm working on
a binding spell.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.971
Ooh, a spell? Can I help?

10:04.004 --> 10:06.774
Possibly,
with-with the research.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.308
It's a very sensitive and...
WILLOW:
Oh!

10:09.341 --> 10:10.977
Who's more
sensitive than me?

10:11.010 --> 10:12.479
...and difficult spell.

10:12.511 --> 10:16.182
It involves creating
a protective circle around...

10:16.216 --> 10:18.618
Well, I don't want
to bore you with the details,

10:18.652 --> 10:20.120
but, uh, well, there's a litany

10:20.153 --> 10:21.520
that one has to recite
in Aramaic,

10:21.553 --> 10:22.789
and it's very specific.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.692
So I need to get a few details

10:24.725 --> 10:28.327
about your experience of
defeating Acathla and Angel.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.798
Fire away.

10:31.831 --> 10:35.201
I've put the time
at about, uh, 6:17,

10:35.235 --> 10:39.438
about half an hour
after Xander rescued me.

10:39.471 --> 10:41.674
Less. More like ten minutes.

10:41.709 --> 10:44.110
Oh, was the vortex
already open?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.712
Barely.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.014
GILES:
I see.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.182
And Angel?

10:49.216 --> 10:51.183
Big fight.

10:51.217 --> 10:52.952
Angel got the pointy end
of the sword,

10:52.985 --> 10:55.322
Acathla sucked him into hell
instead of the world.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.557
That's about the it.

10:57.590 --> 11:00.393
Yes, well, that, um,
should be very helpful.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.028
Oh, no.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.898
I have to go take
an English makeup exam.

11:04.932 --> 11:08.235
They give you credit
just for speaking it, right?

11:09.702 --> 11:11.839
(whimpers)

11:13.206 --> 11:16.076
Mmm! Sage.
I love that smell.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.044
And marnox root?

11:18.077 --> 11:20.047
You know,
a smidge of this

11:20.080 --> 11:22.014
mixed with
a virgin's saliva...

11:22.048 --> 11:24.985
does something
I know nothing about.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.653
These forces

11:26.686 --> 11:29.255
are not something that one
plays around with, Willow.

11:29.288 --> 11:30.890
What have you been conjuring?

11:30.923 --> 11:33.192
Nothing... much.

11:33.225 --> 11:36.363
Well, you know, I tried
the spell to cure Angel,

11:36.395 --> 11:39.099
and I guess
that was a bust.

11:39.131 --> 11:41.600
But since then,
you know, small stuff.

11:41.634 --> 11:44.104
Floating feather,
fire out of ice...

11:44.136 --> 11:47.606
which, next time, I won't
do on the bedspread.

11:47.639 --> 11:49.709
Are you mad at me?

11:49.743 --> 11:52.678
No, of course not, no.

11:52.711 --> 11:55.081
If I were, I would be making

11:55.115 --> 11:57.283
a strange clucking
sound with my tongue.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.286
*

11:59.318 --> 12:03.923
* I've given you
every part of me *

12:06.960 --> 12:10.562
* Tried everything I could

12:10.596 --> 12:13.000
* To make you see

12:16.003 --> 12:19.139
* But you don't love yourself

12:21.107 --> 12:22.942
BUFFY:
Don't let me interrupt.

12:25.111 --> 12:27.246
Thanks.
Are you...
Is she all glowy?

12:28.849 --> 12:30.283
Yeah, I suspect
happiness.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.985
I passed my English makeup exam,

12:33.019 --> 12:34.421
I'm hangin' with my friends...

12:34.453 --> 12:35.754
Hello, my life,

12:35.788 --> 12:37.924
how I've missed you.

12:37.957 --> 12:39.392
WILLOW:
Hi, Scott.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.561
What are you doing here?

12:41.594 --> 12:44.397
You told me if I came after
8:00, I could run into Buffy.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.765
Uh, I'm sorry.
I'm a bad liar.

12:46.799 --> 12:49.336
It's not good for the soul,

12:49.369 --> 12:50.769
or the skin, actually,
it makes me blotch.

12:50.803 --> 12:52.972
Hi, Scott.

12:53.005 --> 12:54.307
SCOTT:
Hi.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.442
Don't you love this song?

12:56.475 --> 12:58.946
Uh, yeah, actually, I do.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.147
Well, would you like to...

13:00.179 --> 13:02.115
Dance?

13:02.149 --> 13:04.951
Um, I don't know.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.019
I'm bad with...

13:07.053 --> 13:08.956
Well...
Thank you for asking.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.256
It's just that there...

13:10.289 --> 13:11.758
SCOTT:
Okay, you know what?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.293
I'm just gonna go stand
by the dance floor.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.361
If you change your mind,
you can mosey on over,

13:15.394 --> 13:17.163
and then if not,
then you don't mosey.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.999
No harm, no foul, right?

13:19.032 --> 13:21.500
Right.

13:21.533 --> 13:24.171
* I have given you
every part of me *

13:24.203 --> 13:26.038
WILLOW:
Come on, Buffy.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.706
I mean, the guy is charm,

13:27.740 --> 13:31.010
and-and normal, which is what
you wanted to get back to.

13:31.043 --> 13:33.779
Plus bonus points
for use of the word "mosey."

13:33.812 --> 13:36.649
I just don't think I'm ready.

13:36.682 --> 13:39.552
What's stopping you?

13:39.586 --> 13:42.721
Check out Slut-o-rama
and her Disco Dave.

13:42.754 --> 13:44.524
What was the last thing
that guy danced to,

13:44.557 --> 13:45.993
K.C. and the Sunshine Band?

13:48.227 --> 13:53.700
* You can't love me
or anyone else *

13:56.202 --> 13:58.205
* You said I was

13:58.238 --> 14:02.741
* The best thing in your life

14:02.774 --> 14:04.912
*

14:04.945 --> 14:07.547
* Is that why you run

14:07.580 --> 14:11.750
* Why you hide...

14:11.783 --> 14:14.354
I don't think that guy
thrives on sunshine.

14:15.721 --> 14:19.058
* And you will never change

14:19.091 --> 14:20.326
Hi.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.163
Hi. Oh, no, I...

14:23.196 --> 14:25.065
I... I have to...

14:25.097 --> 14:28.100
Oh. Uh, uh,
sorry, my bad.

14:28.134 --> 14:30.870
No, it-it's mine.

14:30.903 --> 14:33.206
Really, it's mine,
but I...

14:33.240 --> 14:34.975
I-I have to go.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.615
Where'd she go?

14:42.649 --> 14:44.051
I bet it's nothing.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.684
They're probably
just making out.

14:45.717 --> 14:47.354
GIRL:
Hey.
(thud)

14:47.386 --> 14:49.188
That's not what
making out sounds like,

14:49.221 --> 14:50.657
unless I'm
doing it wrong.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.259
Stop struggling.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.527
This won't hurt.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.894
What?
(grunts)

14:59.899 --> 15:01.734
It's okay, I got it.
You're, uh, Buffy, right?

15:03.169 --> 15:04.937
(snarls)

15:04.971 --> 15:07.106
I'm Faith.

15:07.139 --> 15:08.640
I'm gonna
go out on a limb

15:08.674 --> 15:09.908
and say there's
a new slayer in town.

15:09.942 --> 15:12.980
(grunting)

15:17.149 --> 15:19.251
Can I borrow that?

15:22.688 --> 15:24.657
Aah!

15:27.094 --> 15:28.961
Thanks, B.

15:28.995 --> 15:30.998
Couldn't have done it
without you.

15:37.504 --> 15:40.907
FAITH:
The whole summer it was, like,
the worst heat wave.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.308
So it's about 118 degrees

15:42.341 --> 15:44.911
and I'm sleeping
without a stitch on,

15:44.943 --> 15:46.678
and all of a sudden, I hear
this screaming from outside.

15:46.712 --> 15:48.081
So I go tearing out, stark nude,

15:48.115 --> 15:49.948
and this church bus
has broke down

15:49.982 --> 15:51.584
and there's
these three vamps

15:51.618 --> 15:53.952
feasting on half the
Baptists in South Boston.

15:53.986 --> 15:56.322
So I waste the vamps,
and the preacher comes up

15:56.355 --> 15:57.923
and he's hugging me
like there's no tomorrow,

15:57.956 --> 15:59.826
when all of a sudden,
the cops pull up

15:59.859 --> 16:02.328
and they arrested us both.

16:02.361 --> 16:03.962
Wow. They should
film that story

16:03.996 --> 16:05.697
and show it
every Christmas.

16:05.731 --> 16:08.268
FAITH:
God, I could
eat a horse.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.668
Isn't it crazy how slayin'

16:09.701 --> 16:10.970
just always makes you
hungry and horny?

16:12.639 --> 16:15.207
Well...

16:15.241 --> 16:18.778
sometimes I-I crave
a nonfat yogurt afterwards.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.913
I get it.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.116
Not the horny thing, yuck.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.351
But the two slayer thing.

16:25.384 --> 16:26.952
There was one,

16:26.985 --> 16:29.022
and then Buffy died for,
like, two minutes,

16:29.056 --> 16:30.557
so then Kendra was called,

16:30.590 --> 16:32.359
and then when she died,
Faith was called.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.826
But why were you
called here?

16:34.860 --> 16:36.528
Well, I wasn't.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.164
My Watcher went off to some
retreat thing in England,

16:38.197 --> 16:39.566
and so I skipped out.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.234
I figured
this was my chance

16:41.268 --> 16:43.702
to meet the infamous
Buff and compare notes.

16:43.735 --> 16:46.972
So, B, did you really use
a rocket launcher one time?

16:47.005 --> 16:49.008
Uh, yeah, actually,
it's a funny story. There's...

16:49.042 --> 16:51.844
So what was the story
about that alligator?

16:51.878 --> 16:53.546
You, uh, said
something before.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.746
FAITH:
Oh, there's this
big daddy vampire

16:54.780 --> 16:56.014
out of Missouri

16:56.048 --> 16:57.649
who used to keep them as pets.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.052
So he's got me rasslin'
one of 'em, okay?

16:59.086 --> 17:00.320
The thing must have been

17:00.352 --> 17:02.654
12 feet long
and I'm...

17:02.688 --> 17:04.723
And so was this, um...
(clears throat) ...also naked?

17:04.757 --> 17:07.193
Well, the alligator was.

17:07.227 --> 17:10.730
Xander,
find a new theme.

17:10.762 --> 17:13.432
I tell you, I never had more
trouble than that damn vamp.

17:13.464 --> 17:14.933
So what about you?

17:14.967 --> 17:16.236
What was your toughest kill?

17:19.137 --> 17:21.039
(gasps)

17:23.276 --> 17:25.178
Um, well, you know,

17:25.211 --> 17:27.079
they're all difficult, I guess.

17:27.114 --> 17:29.182
Uh...

17:29.215 --> 17:31.250
Oh! Oh, do you guys
remember the three?

17:31.284 --> 17:33.119
That's right,
you never met the three.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.055
Well, there was three...
OZ:
Something occurring.

17:36.088 --> 17:37.457
Now, you both kill vamps,

17:37.490 --> 17:38.724
and who could
blame you,

17:38.758 --> 17:40.026
but I'm-I'm wondering

17:40.058 --> 17:42.060
about your position
on werewolves.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.563
Oz is
a werewolf.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.198
It's a long story.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.032
I got bit.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.201
Apparently not that long.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.703
Hey, as long as you don't go
scratchin' at me

17:51.738 --> 17:54.240
or humpin' my leg,
we're five by five, you know?

17:54.273 --> 17:55.741
Fair enough.
FAITH:
The vamps, though,

17:55.775 --> 17:59.246
they better get their
asses to DEFCON 1,

17:59.278 --> 18:00.813
'cause you and I
are gonna have fun, you know,

18:00.846 --> 18:03.048
watcher-less and fancy-free.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.116
Watcher-less?

18:04.151 --> 18:07.119
Didn't yours go to England, too?

18:07.153 --> 18:11.157
There's a watchers' retreat
every year in the Cotswolds.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.826
It's a lovely spot.

18:13.859 --> 18:15.827
It's very serene.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.431
There's horse riding and hiking

18:18.464 --> 18:20.567
and punting

18:20.599 --> 18:23.470
and lectures
and discussions.

18:23.502 --> 18:26.105
It's... it's a great honor
to be invited.

18:26.138 --> 18:28.240
Or so I'm told.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.242
Oh, it's boring.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.744
Way too stuffy
for a guy like you.

18:32.778 --> 18:33.980
Um, maybe I should
introduce you again.

18:34.012 --> 18:35.781
Faith, this is Giles.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.084
I've seen him.
If I'd have known they came

18:38.116 --> 18:40.086
that young and cute,
I would've requested
a transfer.

18:40.118 --> 18:41.921
Raise your hand if "ew."

18:41.953 --> 18:43.490
GILES:
Well, um...

18:43.522 --> 18:45.625
Leaving aside for a moment

18:45.657 --> 18:47.660
my, uh, youth and beauty,

18:47.693 --> 18:51.263
I'd-I'd say it was,
um, fortuitous

18:51.298 --> 18:53.465
that Faith arrived
when she did.
Aha!

18:54.534 --> 18:55.768
Sorry.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.636
I just meant... Aha!

18:57.670 --> 19:00.307
There's big evil brewin'.

19:00.339 --> 19:02.442
You'll never be bored here,
Faith, 'cause this is Sunnydale,

19:02.474 --> 19:04.977
home of the Big
Brewin' Evil.

19:05.010 --> 19:07.145
Yes, well, I don't know
how big an evil it is,

19:07.180 --> 19:10.282
but, um, two people
have disappeared

19:10.317 --> 19:13.452
from the Sunset
Ridge district.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.686
Well, I'm good
for patrolling.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.189
Late-ish, though.

19:16.222 --> 19:18.156
I promised Mom I'd
be home for dinner.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.663
Um, to which you're also
invited, of course...

19:24.696 --> 19:25.998
dinner with us.

19:26.031 --> 19:27.467
Dyin' to meet the fam.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.669
I'm in.
Great.

19:29.701 --> 19:31.337
Great, then we can patrol.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.172
Also together.

19:33.205 --> 19:35.307
Hey, don't you have that
health science makeup?

19:35.342 --> 19:37.309
Oh, yeah. Actually, I could
use a little coaching.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.144
You know, you can
hang out with us
while she's testing.

19:39.177 --> 19:40.547
You want to?

19:40.579 --> 19:43.015
Say yes and, uh,
bring your stories.

19:43.048 --> 19:44.584
You guys go. It's-it's fine.

19:44.616 --> 19:46.552
Fine.
I'll just... sit.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.987
Okay.

19:48.019 --> 19:50.222
Hey, later.
We will talk weapons.

19:52.791 --> 19:55.694
This, um...
this new girl

19:55.728 --> 19:57.529
seems to have
a lot of zest.

19:59.598 --> 20:01.534
I've been having
a little problem

20:01.567 --> 20:05.037
with the binding spell
for Acathla.

20:05.070 --> 20:06.506
I'm-I'm lacking
the requisite details

20:06.538 --> 20:08.106
to perform it correctly.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.343
Now, physical location.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.412
Acathla was
facing south?
Mm-hmm.

20:12.444 --> 20:15.013
Acathla, Angel, me,

20:15.047 --> 20:17.349
sword.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.018
See, that's what
I thought, but...

20:19.050 --> 20:20.519
Giles, look,

20:20.553 --> 20:21.753
I've got makeup tests to pass,

20:21.788 --> 20:23.423
missing people in Sunset Ridge,

20:23.455 --> 20:26.092
and a zesty new slayer to feed.

20:26.125 --> 20:29.161
Next time I kill Angel,
I'll video it.

20:30.762 --> 20:32.365
WILLOW:
 And over here,

20:32.398 --> 20:33.633
we have the cafeteria,

20:33.665 --> 20:34.901
where we were
mauled by snakes.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.435
And this is the spot

20:36.469 --> 20:37.703
where Angel tried
to kill Willow.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.238
Oh, and over there
in the lounge

20:39.271 --> 20:41.441
is where Spike and his gang
nearly massacred us all

20:41.473 --> 20:43.410
on Parent-Teacher Night.
(laughs)

20:43.442 --> 20:45.412
Oh, and up those stairs,

20:45.444 --> 20:48.114
I was sucked into
a muddy grave.

20:48.146 --> 20:49.582
And they say young people
don't learn anything

20:49.615 --> 20:50.982
in high school
nowadays,

20:51.017 --> 20:52.451
but, um, I've learned
to be afraid.

20:52.484 --> 20:54.621
(laughs)
You guys are a hoot and a half.

20:54.653 --> 20:56.888
I mean, if I'd had friends
like you in high school,

20:56.923 --> 20:58.758
I... probably still
would've dropped out.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.626
But I might've been
sad about it, you know?

21:00.660 --> 21:03.229
Hey, so what's up
with B?

21:03.261 --> 21:05.263
I mean, she seems
wound kind of tight.

21:05.298 --> 21:08.768
Needs to find the fun
a little, like you two.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.470
WILLOW:
Um, she...
Oh. Water.

21:10.502 --> 21:12.904
Oh, and then
the alligator story.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.673
She's got something,
doesn't she?

21:14.707 --> 21:17.477
What is it with you
and slayers?

21:17.509 --> 21:19.178
Maybe I should
dress up as one

21:19.211 --> 21:20.779
and put a stake
to your throat.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.114
Oh, please, God,

21:22.147 --> 21:23.383
don't let that
be sarcasm.

21:25.384 --> 21:26.986
Oh. Excuse me.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.756
Uh, sorry. I know you
from somewhere.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.590
The Bronze.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.692
You're friends
with Buffy, right?
Yeah. I'm Faith.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.260
I'm Scott.
Nice to meet you.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.463
Nice to meet you.

21:37.497 --> 21:38.998
Well, I'm two for two
with makeup tests.

21:39.030 --> 21:41.433
Proud, yes, but also humble
in this time of...

21:41.468 --> 21:43.269
We're looking
at what?

21:43.301 --> 21:45.605
(both laughing)

21:45.637 --> 21:48.106
Does anyone believe
that that is her
actual hair color?

21:48.140 --> 21:51.042
I haven't seen him
laugh like that.

21:51.076 --> 21:54.113
Hey, maybe Faith and Scott
could hit it off.

21:54.145 --> 21:56.281
I mean, if you're
done with him.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.484
Not that you used him.

22:00.251 --> 22:05.191
Well, I... hadn't definitely
100%

22:05.223 --> 22:06.459
said no
for all time.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.227
It's just,
you know,

22:08.259 --> 22:10.061
you don't enter into
these things lightly.

22:10.096 --> 22:11.564
You know, there's...

22:11.597 --> 22:13.799
there's repercussions
to consider and...

22:13.833 --> 22:15.201
Why am I seeing a look?

22:15.233 --> 22:18.671
You really do need
to find the fun, B...

22:18.704 --> 22:19.939
Uffy.

22:21.374 --> 22:22.608
(sighs)

22:24.376 --> 22:25.577
Hey.

22:25.612 --> 22:27.480
Hey, Buffy, uh,

22:27.513 --> 22:29.548
Faith has been
telling me tall tales.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.851
She's funny,
and she's leaving.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.251
We have to go.

22:33.285 --> 22:34.686
Oh.
Bye.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.756
He's a cutie.

22:36.788 --> 22:38.891
Is he seeing
anybody?

22:38.924 --> 22:41.192
Mr. Trick,

22:41.227 --> 22:43.095
talk to me.

22:43.128 --> 22:44.730
Check this out.

22:44.763 --> 22:47.333
This town,
this very street,

22:47.365 --> 22:49.435
wired for fiber optics.

22:49.469 --> 22:52.270
See, we jack in a T3--

22:52.304 --> 22:54.339
2,500 megs per--

22:54.373 --> 22:56.241
we have the whole world
at our fingertips.

22:56.275 --> 23:00.246
All I'm saying is,
we stay local--

23:00.278 --> 23:02.714
where the humans are jumpin'
and the cotton is high--

23:02.749 --> 23:04.916
but we live global.

23:04.951 --> 23:06.553
I mean, you know,
you get the hankering

23:06.586 --> 23:08.688
for the blood of
a 15-year-old Filipina,

23:08.721 --> 23:12.892
and I'm on the Net and she's
here the next day, Express Air.

23:12.924 --> 23:16.228
I want the blood of the slayer.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.932
On that note, there's
good news and bad.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.903
Rumor has it that this town
already has a slayer,

23:23.935 --> 23:25.438
which makes two.

23:25.471 --> 23:28.273
I'm not real sure
how that happened.

23:28.307 --> 23:30.409
I don't care
if there are 100 Slayers.

23:30.442 --> 23:32.377
I'll kill them all.

23:32.411 --> 23:35.847
She's going to pay
for what she did to me.

23:37.148 --> 23:38.718
Yeah, she is.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.487
(knock on door)
I'm running
a computer check

23:40.519 --> 23:42.489
on every hotel,
rooming house,

23:42.521 --> 23:44.557
and youth hostel
in town.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.893
Meanwhile,

23:46.925 --> 23:49.996
as soon as the sun goes down,

23:50.028 --> 23:53.164
we're out in force.

23:53.199 --> 23:56.434
Food's here, boys.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.204
You guys order a...

24:01.773 --> 24:02.974
(snarls)

24:03.009 --> 24:04.743
So you're a slayer, too.

24:04.777 --> 24:07.113
Isn't that interesting?
Do you like it?

24:07.145 --> 24:08.515
God, I love it.

24:08.548 --> 24:09.615
Uh, Mom...

24:09.648 --> 24:11.416
Just a second, honey.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.751
You know, Buffy
never talks that way.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.520
Why do you love it?

24:14.554 --> 24:16.788
FAITH:
Well, when I'm fighting,

24:16.823 --> 24:19.090
it's like
the whole world goes away

24:19.125 --> 24:20.660
and I only know one thing:

24:20.692 --> 24:23.261
That I'm gonna win
and they're gonna lose.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.497
I like that feelin'.

24:24.530 --> 24:25.698
BUFFY:
Well, sure.

24:25.731 --> 24:27.432
Beats that dead
feeling you get

24:27.465 --> 24:28.634
when they win and you lose.

24:28.667 --> 24:30.769
I don't let that kind
of negative thinking in.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.104
Right.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.507
Right. That could get you hurt.

24:34.540 --> 24:36.843
Buffy can be awfully
negative sometimes.

24:36.875 --> 24:38.477
See, honey,
you gotta fight that.

24:38.510 --> 24:39.711
Working on it.

24:39.746 --> 24:41.146
Oh, Faith,

24:41.180 --> 24:42.515
can I, uh, get you
another soft drink?

24:42.548 --> 24:43.849
Oh, you bet.
Thanks.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.353
She's really cool, huh?

24:47.385 --> 24:48.921
Best mom ever.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.092
Excuse me.

24:59.865 --> 25:01.867
I like this girl, Buffy.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.201
She's very personable.

25:03.234 --> 25:05.203
She gets along
with my friends,

25:05.237 --> 25:07.472
my watcher, my mom...

25:07.506 --> 25:10.476
Look, now she's getting
along with my fries.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.711
Now, Buffy...

25:11.743 --> 25:13.144
Plus, at school today,

25:13.179 --> 25:15.013
she was making eyes
at my not-boyfriend.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.548
This is creepy.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.483
Does anybody else
think Faith is creepy?

25:18.517 --> 25:20.886
No,

25:20.920 --> 25:22.888
but I'm the one getting
 Single White Femaled here.

25:22.922 --> 25:25.257
It's probably good
you were an only child.

25:25.290 --> 25:28.059
Mom, I'm just getting
my life back.

25:28.094 --> 25:31.029
I'm not looking
to go halvsies on it.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.765
Well, there are some things
I'd be happy to see you share...

25:32.798 --> 25:34.500
like the slaying.

25:34.532 --> 25:37.068
I mean, two of you fighting
is safer than one, right?

25:38.770 --> 25:40.405
I guess.

25:40.439 --> 25:42.074
Unless, I mean, you heard her.

25:42.107 --> 25:44.242
She loves the slaying.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.679
Couldn't she take over for you?

25:46.712 --> 25:49.882
Mom, no one can
take over for me.

25:49.915 --> 25:51.416
But you're going
to college next year.

25:51.450 --> 25:53.184
I think it would be...
Mom, the only way

25:53.219 --> 25:55.554
you get a new slayer is when
the old slayer dies.

25:57.489 --> 25:58.758
Then that means you...

26:00.425 --> 26:02.461
When did you die?
You never told me you died.

26:02.493 --> 26:03.895
No, it-it was just
for a few minutes.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.131
Oh, I hate this.

26:05.163 --> 26:06.397
I hate your life.

26:06.432 --> 26:07.933
Mom, I...

26:07.967 --> 26:11.037
Look, I-I know you
didn't choose this.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.805
I know it chose you.

26:12.838 --> 26:18.210
I have tried to march in the
"Slayer Pride" parade, but...

26:18.243 --> 26:20.179
I don't want you to die.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.548
Oh...

26:22.580 --> 26:24.383
I'm not gonna die.

26:24.415 --> 26:27.086
I know how
to do my job.

26:27.118 --> 26:29.555
Besides, like you said,

26:29.587 --> 26:31.589
I've got help now.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.596
I've got all the help
I can stand.

26:45.171 --> 26:47.573
Didn't we, um, do
this street already?

26:47.605 --> 26:49.275
Funny thing
about vamps...

26:49.307 --> 26:51.677
they'll hit a street
even after you've been there.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.511
It's like they have
no manners.

26:53.545 --> 26:56.115
Mmm. You've been
doing this the longest.

26:56.147 --> 26:57.784
I have.

26:57.817 --> 27:00.185
Yeah. Maybe
a little too long.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.188
Excuse me?

27:02.221 --> 27:03.454
What's that
supposed to mean?

27:03.489 --> 27:05.156
Nothing.

27:05.191 --> 27:06.424
You got a problem?

27:06.458 --> 27:07.660
I'm five by five,
here, B,

27:07.693 --> 27:09.161
living entirely large,

27:09.194 --> 27:11.329
actually wondering
about your problem.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.531
Well, I may not
sleep in the nude

27:13.565 --> 27:14.800
and rassle alligators...

27:14.834 --> 27:16.769
Maybe it's time you started,

27:16.803 --> 27:19.171
'cause obviously something
in your bottle needs uncorking.

27:19.204 --> 27:22.040
What is it, the...
the Angel thing?

27:22.074 --> 27:24.777
What do you know
about Angel?

27:24.810 --> 27:26.211
Just what your friends tell me.

27:26.244 --> 27:27.946
Big love, big loss.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.148
You ought to deal and move on,
but you're not.

27:30.182 --> 27:31.718
I got an idea.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.352
How about from now on,

27:33.384 --> 27:35.121
we don't hear from you on Angel

27:35.153 --> 27:36.622
or anything else
in my life?

27:36.654 --> 27:38.356
Which, by the way, is my life.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.792
What are you getting
so strung out for, B?

27:40.826 --> 27:43.295
Why are your lips
still moving, F?

27:43.328 --> 27:45.798
Did I just hear a threat?
Would you like to?

27:45.832 --> 27:47.365
Wow. You think you can take me?

27:47.398 --> 27:49.401
Yeah.

27:49.434 --> 27:51.804
I just hope they can't.

27:51.837 --> 27:52.838
(grunts)

27:52.872 --> 27:54.205
(snarling)

28:11.356 --> 28:11.958
Ah!

28:18.696 --> 28:20.298
My dead mother hits
harder than that.

28:27.538 --> 28:29.976
Faith, stake him already
and give me a hand!

28:33.112 --> 28:36.382
This is me,
you undead bastard!

28:36.414 --> 28:38.384
VAMP:
For Kakistos we live!

28:38.416 --> 28:40.251
For Kakistos you'll die!

28:40.286 --> 28:42.188
Faith!

28:42.221 --> 28:44.222
Oh!
(grunting)

28:51.730 --> 28:52.564
(snarling)

28:52.597 --> 28:54.566
(grunting)

28:59.005 --> 29:00.271
Faith!

29:03.843 --> 29:06.979
You can't touch me!

29:13.019 --> 29:15.453
What is wrong with you?
What are you talking about?

29:15.487 --> 29:18.223
I'm talking about you
"living large" on that vampire.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.959
Gee, if doing violence
to vampires upsets you,

29:19.991 --> 29:21.460
I think you're
in the wrong line of work.

29:21.492 --> 29:24.096
Yeah, or maybe you like it
a little too much.

29:24.130 --> 29:26.298
I was getting the job done.

29:26.332 --> 29:28.233
The job is to slay demons,

29:28.267 --> 29:30.402
not beat them to a bloody pulp

29:30.435 --> 29:31.804
while their friends
corner me.

29:31.837 --> 29:33.873
I thought you could
handle yourself.

29:36.041 --> 29:37.943
(sighs)

29:37.977 --> 29:39.644
GILES:
What you must
realize, Buffy,

29:39.677 --> 29:42.314
is that you and Faith have
very different temperaments.

29:42.347 --> 29:43.950
Yeah, and mine's
the sane one.
(chuckles)

29:43.982 --> 29:45.784
The girl's not playing
with a full deck, Giles.

29:45.817 --> 29:47.252
She has almost no deck.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.787
She has a three.

29:48.820 --> 29:51.022
You said yourself
that she killed one.

29:51.057 --> 29:52.858
She's-she's just
a plucky fighter

29:52.892 --> 29:54.861
who got a little
carried away,

29:54.894 --> 29:56.295
which is natural.

29:56.327 --> 29:57.963
She's focused
on the slaying.

29:57.997 --> 29:59.798
She doesn't have a whole
other life here, as you do.

29:59.832 --> 30:02.101
She doesn't need
a life. She has mine.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.469
I think you're
being a little...

30:03.501 --> 30:05.371
No. I'm being a lot.
I know that.

30:05.403 --> 30:07.373
But she nearly
got us both killed.

30:07.405 --> 30:09.174
The girl needs help.

30:09.208 --> 30:10.776
All right. I'll see
if I can reach

30:10.808 --> 30:12.611
her watcher
at the retreat.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.446
They're eight hours
ahead now.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.817
Means they're probably
sitting down to a nightcap.

30:18.851 --> 30:20.719
I wonder if they
still kayak.

30:20.751 --> 30:22.888
I used to love
a good kayak.

30:22.922 --> 30:26.491
You see, they don't
even consider...

30:26.525 --> 30:27.894
Sorry, I digress.

30:27.926 --> 30:31.163
The, um, vampires
that attacked you,

30:31.196 --> 30:32.999
can you furnish me
with some details

30:33.031 --> 30:34.866
that might help me
trace their lineage?

30:34.901 --> 30:37.169
I mean, ancient
or modern dress?

30:37.202 --> 30:39.305
Amulets,
cultish tattoos?

30:39.337 --> 30:41.073
Uh, no tats.

30:41.106 --> 30:42.840
Crappy dressers.

30:42.875 --> 30:45.477
And, uh... oh, the one
that nearly bit me

30:45.510 --> 30:48.079
mentioned something
about "kissing toast."

30:48.114 --> 30:50.048
He lived
for kissing toast.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.317
Do you mean Kakistos?

30:51.349 --> 30:52.851
Maybe it was
taquitos.

30:52.884 --> 30:54.319
Maybe he lived
for taquitos...

30:54.353 --> 30:55.653
What?

30:55.686 --> 30:56.923
Kakistos.

30:59.758 --> 31:01.460
Is that bad?

31:02.760 --> 31:04.230
"Kakistos" is Greek.

31:04.262 --> 31:05.897
It means "the worst
of the worst."

31:05.932 --> 31:07.766
It's also the name
of a vampire so old

31:07.798 --> 31:10.602
that his hands
and feet are cloven.

31:14.405 --> 31:17.509
Now, this guy shows up
two days ago, right?

31:17.542 --> 31:19.377
Right around
the same time

31:19.411 --> 31:21.913
my bestest new little sister
makes the scene.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.749
You think he and Faith
are connected?

31:23.781 --> 31:25.784
Giles, there are
two things

31:25.817 --> 31:27.185
that I don't believe in:

31:27.219 --> 31:28.787
coincidence
and leprechauns.

31:28.819 --> 31:30.588
Well, Buffy,
it's entirely possible

31:30.622 --> 31:33.358
that they both arrived here
by chance simultaneously.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.362
Okay, but I was right about
the leprechauns, right?

31:36.394 --> 31:38.430
As far as I know, yes.

31:38.463 --> 31:39.765
Good.

31:39.798 --> 31:42.134
Okay, you get
England on the phone.

31:42.167 --> 31:43.602
I'm gonna
talk to Faith,

31:43.634 --> 31:45.903
see if Khaki Trousers
rings...
Kakistos.

31:45.938 --> 31:48.374
Kakistos rings a bell...
or an alarm.

31:48.406 --> 31:49.607
Right.

31:49.641 --> 31:50.909
Right.

31:59.151 --> 32:00.586
Hi.

32:00.618 --> 32:03.255
Scott.
How are you?

32:03.288 --> 32:05.991
Uh, okay. You know, I gotta...

32:06.025 --> 32:07.292
I know, be somewhere else,
right?

32:07.326 --> 32:08.926
Think of this as
my last-ditch effort.

32:08.961 --> 32:11.130
I realize that one more
is gonna qualify as stalking.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.598
I've given
a lot of thought--

32:13.632 --> 32:15.134
some might say
too much thought--

32:15.166 --> 32:18.104
to how I might be
a part of your life.

32:18.136 --> 32:19.971
It begins with conversation.

32:20.006 --> 32:21.240
We all know this.

32:21.272 --> 32:23.642
Maybe over a cup of coffee,

32:23.674 --> 32:25.644
or maybe at the
Buster Keaton Festival

32:25.676 --> 32:27.679
playing on State Street
all this weekend.

32:31.049 --> 32:33.419
You know, come to think of it,

32:33.451 --> 32:36.521
I don't think I've given
a fair chance to...

32:36.555 --> 32:38.089
Buster Keaton.

32:38.124 --> 32:40.925
I... I like what

32:40.959 --> 32:42.594
I've seen of him so far.

32:42.627 --> 32:44.962
I... I think it might be time
to see a little more.

32:47.165 --> 32:48.933
Keaton is key.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.301
Oh. Um...

32:50.336 --> 32:52.203
I got you
a little present.

32:52.238 --> 32:53.471
The guy in
the retro shop

32:53.505 --> 32:55.507
said that it
represents friendship,

32:55.540 --> 32:57.576
and that's something
I would very much like
to have with you.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.815
You like?

33:07.318 --> 33:08.619
I can't.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.521
I-I-I can't do this.

33:12.258 --> 33:14.625
Okay.

33:14.660 --> 33:15.894
I get the message.

33:18.696 --> 33:20.898
Are you all right?
Uh...

33:20.932 --> 33:23.501
Giles, I, uh...

33:23.535 --> 33:25.371
Yeah, I'm fine.

33:25.403 --> 33:27.806
Um, did you reach
the retreat?

33:27.838 --> 33:29.974
Yes, I did.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.077
What did her watcher say?

33:32.111 --> 33:34.613
Her watcher's dead.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.886
MAN:
 The room's $18 a day.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.021
That's every day.
Yeah, I know.

33:44.056 --> 33:45.856
I'll get it to you
by tomorrow, I swear.

33:45.891 --> 33:47.692
It's not like
I own the place.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.494
But I bet you will someday.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.297
Not if I listen
to broads like you.

33:52.897 --> 33:54.900
Roommates are extra.

33:54.932 --> 33:56.701
I'm just visiting.

34:00.405 --> 34:03.209
So, what brings you
to the poor side of town?

34:06.311 --> 34:07.846
Cloven guy.

34:07.878 --> 34:09.380
Goes by the name Kakistos.

34:10.782 --> 34:12.384
What do you know

34:12.418 --> 34:13.885
about Kakistos?

34:13.918 --> 34:15.320
That he's here.

34:17.789 --> 34:20.126
We're not happy to see
old friends, are we?

34:20.159 --> 34:21.860
What'd he do to you?

34:21.893 --> 34:24.096
It's what I did to him,
all right?

34:25.731 --> 34:28.534
And what was that?

34:28.567 --> 34:29.867
Faith, you came here
for a reason.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.103
I can help.

34:31.137 --> 34:32.737
You can mind your own business.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.373
I'm the one who can handle this.

34:34.405 --> 34:36.375
Yeah. You're
a real badass

34:36.407 --> 34:37.909
when it comes
to packing.

34:37.943 --> 34:39.445
What was that you said about my
problem?

34:39.478 --> 34:41.746
Gotta deal and move on?
Well, we have

34:41.780 --> 34:43.782
the "moving on"
part right here.
What about dealing?

34:43.815 --> 34:45.751
Is that just something
you're gonna dump on me?

34:45.784 --> 34:47.318
You don't know me.

34:47.353 --> 34:49.121
You don't know what
I've been through.

34:49.155 --> 34:50.456
I'll take care
of this, all right?

34:50.489 --> 34:52.590
Like you took care
of your watcher?

34:59.764 --> 35:02.168
He killed her, didn't he?

35:02.201 --> 35:05.003
They don't have a word
for what he did to her.

35:05.036 --> 35:06.538
(knock on door)

35:10.608 --> 35:12.978
Oh, what now?
Faith, you run,
he runs after you.

35:13.010 --> 35:15.112
That's where the head start
comes in handy.

35:17.648 --> 35:19.485
(snarling)

35:19.518 --> 35:20.952
Faith.

35:27.958 --> 35:29.059
No!

35:30.695 --> 35:32.431
(grunting)

35:32.463 --> 35:33.798
Aah!
No!

35:33.831 --> 35:36.601
I just bought us
a little more... time.

35:36.635 --> 35:39.570
No! No!
Scream later. Escape now.

35:46.143 --> 35:47.378
Let's go!

35:48.646 --> 35:50.315
*

36:05.764 --> 36:08.099
We're okay.
What happened?

36:11.503 --> 36:14.039
Faith, what happened?

36:14.072 --> 36:15.706
I...

36:15.740 --> 36:18.175
I was there when
he killed my watcher,

36:18.210 --> 36:21.246
and I saw what he did to her.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.148
What he was gonna
do to me.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.251
I tried to stop him,
but I... I couldn't.

36:25.284 --> 36:27.184
And I ran.

36:27.219 --> 36:28.653
Faith, first rule of slaying:

36:28.686 --> 36:30.155
Don't die.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.157
You did the right thing.
Okay?

36:32.190 --> 36:33.391
You didn't die.

36:33.425 --> 36:35.226
Now you do the math.

36:35.260 --> 36:37.027
One of him, two of us.

36:37.061 --> 36:39.063
Yes.

36:39.097 --> 36:40.532
No.

36:42.967 --> 36:45.371
FAITH:
This is his place.

36:45.403 --> 36:46.605
He drove us here.

36:46.637 --> 36:49.106
(snarls)

37:07.057 --> 37:08.226
Faith!

37:09.327 --> 37:10.961
Don't die!

37:20.237 --> 37:21.340
(snarling)

37:24.009 --> 37:26.277
Don't!

37:36.253 --> 37:37.356
(snarls)

37:39.990 --> 37:42.260
(grunting)

37:42.293 --> 37:44.295
If we don't do something,

37:44.329 --> 37:46.297
the master could get killed.

37:46.331 --> 37:48.166
(grunting continues)

37:48.199 --> 37:50.668
Well, our prayers are with him.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.639
There's a reason
these vengeance crusades

37:54.672 --> 37:56.106
are out of style.

37:56.141 --> 37:59.878
See, the modern vampire,
we see the big picture.

38:07.818 --> 38:09.855
I guess you need
a bigger stake, Slayer.

38:09.887 --> 38:11.556
(laughing maniacally)

38:31.842 --> 38:33.612
You hungry?

38:33.644 --> 38:34.880
Starved.

38:38.248 --> 38:40.518
(indistinct chatter)

38:40.552 --> 38:45.155
The council has
approved our request.

38:45.190 --> 38:47.559
Faith is to stay here
indefinitely

38:47.592 --> 38:48.960
and I'm to look
after you both

38:48.994 --> 38:50.661
until a new watcher
is assigned.

38:50.695 --> 38:51.963
Good.

38:51.996 --> 38:55.032
She really came through
in the end.

38:55.065 --> 38:56.668
She had a lot to deal with,

38:56.702 --> 38:58.403
but she did it.

38:58.436 --> 39:00.070
She got it
behind her.

39:00.105 --> 39:01.606
I'm glad to hear it.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.413
Angel was cured.

39:11.248 --> 39:12.583
I'm sorry?

39:14.619 --> 39:16.688
When I killed him,

39:16.722 --> 39:18.623
Angel was cured.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.393
Your spell worked
at the last minute, Will.

39:24.295 --> 39:27.331
I was about to take
him out, and, um,

39:27.364 --> 39:29.601
something went through him...

39:29.635 --> 39:31.769
and he was Angel again.

39:33.639 --> 39:37.175
He-he didn't remember
anything that he'd done.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.376
He just held me.

39:40.746 --> 39:44.081
Um, but it was...

39:44.114 --> 39:46.418
it was too late, and I-I had to.

39:48.152 --> 39:51.722
So I-I told him
that I loved him...

39:51.757 --> 39:53.625
and I kissed him...

39:53.659 --> 39:56.094
and I killed him.

40:03.668 --> 40:07.338
I don't know if that helps
with your spell or not, Giles.

40:09.273 --> 40:11.976
Uh, yes, I believe it will.

40:12.010 --> 40:14.311
I'm sorry.

40:14.344 --> 40:15.614
It's okay.

40:17.114 --> 40:20.885
I've been holding on
to that for so long.

40:20.918 --> 40:23.021
Felt good to get it out.

40:25.856 --> 40:28.092
I'll see you guys later.

40:38.268 --> 40:41.239
Giles, I know
you don't like me

40:41.271 --> 40:42.840
playing with
mystical forces,

40:42.873 --> 40:45.844
but I can really help
with this binding spell.

40:45.876 --> 40:47.713
There is no spell.

41:01.726 --> 41:02.994
Scott.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.264
Hello.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.467
Hey. Uh, I was, um,

41:09.501 --> 41:11.469
I was waiting for you
to get out of class.

41:11.503 --> 41:13.639
Oh.

41:13.672 --> 41:16.273
Uh, why?
Um...

41:16.306 --> 41:19.277
there was someone, a while ago,

41:19.309 --> 41:20.811
and, uh, the ring
sort of confused me.

41:20.846 --> 41:22.614
But I liked

41:22.648 --> 41:24.449
what you said
about friendship.
I liked it a lot.

41:24.481 --> 41:25.684
And Buster Keaton-- big fun.

41:25.717 --> 41:27.052
And I'm capable of big fun,

41:27.085 --> 41:28.554
even though there's
no earthly way

41:28.586 --> 41:30.221
you could possibly
know that about me.

41:30.255 --> 41:32.056
Wow. If I knew I was
gonna go on this long,

41:32.090 --> 41:34.291
I probably would've
brought some water.

41:34.324 --> 41:36.728
Uh, what I'm trying
to say is, um...

41:36.762 --> 41:39.630
if you would still like to go
to the film festival--

41:39.664 --> 41:41.733
and I would understand
if you didn't--

41:41.766 --> 41:45.503
I'd pretty much love
to go with you.

41:45.536 --> 41:46.972
Uh...

41:47.005 --> 41:48.306
Ahem.

41:48.338 --> 41:50.007
I don't know, Buffy.

41:50.041 --> 41:52.077
I'm-I'm really gonna have
to think about this.

41:53.612 --> 41:55.547
Okay. You know what,
I thought about it
and I'm in.

41:55.581 --> 41:57.081
When do you want to go?

41:57.114 --> 41:58.849
Uh, well,
I have one thing

41:58.884 --> 42:00.751
that I have
to do tonight,

42:00.786 --> 42:02.853
and then I'm good.

42:02.887 --> 42:04.289
Good.

42:06.958 --> 42:08.960
(owl hooting)

42:12.597 --> 42:14.599
*

42:46.831 --> 42:48.498
Good-bye.

43:18.764 --> 43:20.766
*

43:47.458 --> 43:49.360
(grunts, whimpers)

44:44.048 --> 44:46.516
Grr. Argh.
