09:24.533 --> 09:26.333
PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK!

09:26.433 --> 09:28.633
BOTH OF THEM. NOW!
-WHAT HAPPENED?

09:32.933 --> 09:34.900
-COULD YOU HAVE BEEN
MORE OBVIOUS, MY MAN?

09:35.067 --> 09:36.533
-I...
-COME ON, NOW.

09:36.633 --> 09:38.167
I'VE BEEN IN THE GAME
TOO LONG.

09:38.267 --> 09:40.100
-I DIDN'T DO NOTHING.
-YOU DIDN'T DO NOTHING?

09:40.200 --> 09:43.433
YOU DIDN'T TAKE THAT POUCH
OUT OF YOUR POCKET AND THROW IT
OVER THERE INTO THE GRASS?

09:43.533 --> 09:45.067
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME!

09:45.167 --> 09:46.300
-I DIDN'T THROW NOTHING.
-COME ON!

09:46.400 --> 09:48.500
IT'S GOT WEED IN IT
'CAUSE I CAN SMELL IT ON YOU.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.867
-I AIN'T GOT NO WEED.

09:49.967 --> 09:52.100
-OKAY. NO, YOU DON'T NOW,
'CAUSE YOU THREW IT OVER THERE.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.467
94, ROLL ME ONE MORE
NON-EMERGENCY. I GOT
ONE DETAINED.

09:58.600 --> 10:02.267
-YOU GONNA DETAIN ME?
FOR WHAT, WHAT'D I DO?

10:02.367 --> 10:03.800
WHAT'D I DO?

10:06.533 --> 10:07.967
-HE THREW IT PRETTY FAR.

10:08.067 --> 10:10.633
I SAW IT, IT WAS LIKE
A WOMAN'S POUCH.

10:12.200 --> 10:15.433
HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO.

10:20.733 --> 10:23.400
YOU DIDN'T QUITE THROW IT
FAR ENOUGH, BOSS.

10:23.500 --> 10:26.533
WHY DO YOU THINK I HAD YOU
STAND DIRECTLY IN FRONT
OF MY CAR?

10:26.633 --> 10:27.867
SO I COULD WATCH YOU.

10:27.967 --> 10:29.867
AND WHILE YOU'RE STANDING
DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF MY CAR,

10:29.967 --> 10:31.000
-WHAT DO YOU DO?
-THAT AIN'T MINE.

10:31.100 --> 10:32.233
-THAT AIN'T YOURS?

10:32.333 --> 10:34.400
SO, I DIDN'T WATCH YOU
TAKE THIS OUT OF YOUR POCKET

10:34.500 --> 10:35.600
AND THROW IT?
-NO.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.033
-WHAT'S IN HERE?

10:37.133 --> 10:38.667
-I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THERE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THERE.

10:38.767 --> 10:41.900
-THIS FINE GENTLEMAN HERE
LIKES TO INSULT MY INTELLIGENCE.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
OH, LOOK! IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

10:44.100 --> 10:46.467
-THAT AIN'T MINE.
MAN, THAT'S OVER THERE
IN THE WOODS.

10:46.567 --> 10:48.167
-IT'S OVER THERE
IN THE WOODS, HUH?

10:48.267 --> 10:51.033
AFTER YOU THREW IT
DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME.

10:51.133 --> 10:52.333
-I DIDN'T THROW NO (bleep).

10:52.433 --> 10:53.800
-COME ON, MAN!

10:53.900 --> 10:55.367
-GOT ANYTHING ELSE
ON YOU, MAN?

10:55.467 --> 10:58.167
-NAH, I AIN'T GOT (bleep)
I AIN'T GOT (bleep).

10:58.267 --> 10:59.500
-LISTEN TO ME, BOSS.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.100
WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT
RIGHT NOW

11:01.200 --> 11:04.233
IF YOU'RE GONNA GO
TO FULTON COUNTY FOR
TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE,

11:04.333 --> 11:08.300
OR ARE WE GONNA GO
TO CITY JAIL FOR LESS
THAN AN OUNCE,

11:08.400 --> 11:10.400
AND A BICYCLE CHARGE?

11:10.500 --> 11:14.533
AND I'LL FORGO
DISCARDING EVIDENCE
AND OBSTRUCTION.

11:14.633 --> 11:18.267
THAT DEPENDS ON
IF WE WANNA MAN UP
AND ADMIT WHAT WE DID

11:18.367 --> 11:21.900
DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF
THE POLICE SERGEANT'S EYES.

11:22.067 --> 11:23.800
IT'S EITHER PRE-TRIAL
OR FULTON COUNTY.

11:23.900 --> 11:24.933
-I'LL GO TO PRE-TRIAL.

11:25.067 --> 11:26.067
-YOU WANNA GO
TO PRE-TRIAL.

11:26.133 --> 11:27.900
OKAY, SO WHAT
DID MY EYES SEE?

11:28.067 --> 11:29.767
-YOUR EYES DIDN'T SEE ME.

11:29.867 --> 11:31.367
-WHAT'D MY EYES SEE?

11:31.467 --> 11:33.333
-I GUESS YOUR EYES
SEEN RIGHT.

11:33.433 --> 11:34.833
-THEY SEEN RIGHT, OKAY.

11:34.933 --> 11:36.167
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT, MY MAN.

11:36.267 --> 11:38.467
I APPRECIATE YOU
OWNING UP, THOUGH. THAT'S...

11:38.567 --> 11:40.067
-CAN I USE
THE RESTROOM, OFFICER?

11:40.133 --> 11:42.533
-YEAH, I'LL WORK WITH YOU.
I'LL WORK WITH YOU. BRING
ONE KNEE IN.

11:42.633 --> 11:44.233
THERE YOU GO.

11:44.333 --> 11:45.933
TAKE HIM BACK
TO YOUR CAR,

11:46.067 --> 11:48.600
AND SEARCH HIM REAL GOOD
BEFORE YOU PUT HIM
BACK IN THERE.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.700
AND I RESPECT YOU
FINALLY OWNING IT.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.967
BUT I'VE STILL
GOT A JOB TO DO.

11:54.067 --> 11:56.400
NOW, THAT WAS
ALL OF IT, CORRECT?

11:56.500 --> 12:00.500
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY TAPED ON YOU
OR ANYTHING HIDDEN, RIGHT?
-NO.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.200
YOU SURE?

12:02.300 --> 12:04.267
-'CAUSE THIS'LL BE
YOUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY.

12:04.367 --> 12:06.367
'CAUSE IF YOU TAKE ANYTHING
INSIDE THAT SALLY PORT,

12:06.467 --> 12:08.067
IT BECOMES A FELONY,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

12:08.133 --> 12:09.467
-YEAH.
-ALL RIGHT.

12:09.567 --> 12:11.833
-YOU GO INSIDE
THAT SALLY PORT...

12:11.933 --> 12:13.233
-SPREAD YOUR LEGS FOR ME.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.067
-...THAT'S A FELONY CHARGE.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.400
IS THERE MORE ON YOU?

12:16.500 --> 12:18.167
-YOU GOT ANY MORE ON YOU,
YOU GOTTA--
-YOU'RE SITTING HERE--

12:18.267 --> 12:19.200
-I GOT IT ON ME.

12:19.300 --> 12:20.333
-WHERE AT?
-IN YOUR SHOE?

12:20.433 --> 12:21.733
-IN THE SHOE.
-IN YOUR SHOE?
HOW MUCH?

12:21.833 --> 12:23.700
-IT'S JUST A LITTLE
GRAM OR SOMETHING.

12:23.800 --> 12:24.900
-A LITTLE GRAM?

12:25.067 --> 12:26.300
-IT'S ALL PERSONAL STUFF.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.700
-OKAY.
-I'M ON MEDICATION.

12:30.067 --> 12:31.900
JUST INSIDE MY SOCK
RIGHT HERE.

12:32.067 --> 12:34.367
-IT'S IN YOUR SOCK?
OKAY, I SEE IT. I SEE IT.

12:34.467 --> 12:35.800
YOU GOT GLOVES?
-YES, SIR.

12:35.900 --> 12:37.233
-OKAY. JUST HANG TIGHT.

12:37.333 --> 12:39.833
HONESTY, DUDE.
HONESTY WILL HELP YOU OUT.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.967
IF IT'S JUST A LITTLE GRAM,

12:42.067 --> 12:44.233
YOU MIGHT STILL BE UNDER
AN OUNCE AND YOU'LL
STILL BE GOOD,

12:44.333 --> 12:46.700
AND I'M STILL A MAN
OF MY WORD, AND I'LL
PUT YOU IN CITY JAIL.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.667
-SO, WHAT AM I CHARGED WITH?

12:48.767 --> 12:51.533
-IF IT'S JUST THAT LITTLE ONE--
IS THERE ONE IN THE OTHER SOCK?
OR IS IT JUST THAT ONE?

12:51.633 --> 12:52.967
-THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE.
-THAT'S IT?

12:53.067 --> 12:55.467
OKAY, YOU SHOULD STILL BE
LESS THAN AN OUNCE.

12:55.567 --> 12:59.600
SO, I'LL STILL-- WE'LL STILL
STAY WITH WHAT I SAID, OKAY?

12:59.700 --> 13:03.433
NOW, NO PROBATION OR PAROLE
POPPED UP.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.833
YOU'RE NOT ON MISDEMEANOR
PROBATION ANYWHERE, ARE YOU?

13:05.933 --> 13:07.800
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

13:07.900 --> 13:11.200
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT.
YOU'LL HAVE A CITY COURT DATE
FOR THE LESS THAN AN OUNCE,

13:11.300 --> 13:14.233
AND THEN THE BICYCLE
LIGHT REQUIREMENT.

13:14.333 --> 13:16.867
AND YOU JUST MADE
A VERY POOR DECISION.

13:16.967 --> 13:18.400
BUT AFTER THE FACT, MAN,

13:18.500 --> 13:20.200
YOU WERE RIGHT
IN FRONT OF ME, MAN.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.800
YOU GO FROM THE BACK POCKET,
YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
AND THEN,

13:22.900 --> 13:25.067
WHOO!
-I SEEN YOU COME UP
BY THE GATE,

13:25.167 --> 13:26.733
I SHOULD HAVE THROWN IT THEN.

13:26.833 --> 13:29.533
-I WISH YOU COULD HAVE
BEEN IN MY SHOES,
'CAUSE I ALMOST HAD TO LAUGH.

13:31.667 --> 13:33.800
-BORN AND RAISED IN KANSAS,

13:33.900 --> 13:36.867
AND I DECIDED TO MOVE
AWAY FOR SCHOOL.

13:36.967 --> 13:39.167
AND I THOUGHT I WANTED
TO BE A SCIENCE NERD,

13:39.267 --> 13:40.733
BUT IT JUST WASN'T
FOR ME.

13:40.833 --> 13:43.433
DECIDED TO TRY OUT
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

13:43.533 --> 13:46.067
I'VE BEEN POLICING
FOR THREE YEARS NOW.

13:46.167 --> 13:51.800
I LOVE IT. IT'S BEEN ONE
OF THE BEST EXPERIENCES
OF MY LIFE SO FAR.

13:51.900 --> 13:54.333
JUST RECEIVED A CALL
FROM A PASSERBY

13:54.433 --> 13:57.600
SAYING THAT A WHITE MALE,
KHAKI PANTS, NO SHIRT,

13:57.700 --> 14:01.600
WAS ASSAULTING A WHITE FEMALE
WITH PINK SHIRT AND BLONDE HAIR.

14:01.700 --> 14:06.100
THERE ARE A COUPLE PEOPLE
WITNESSING THE EVENT,
APPARENTLY.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.167
HELLO! WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:12.267 --> 14:13.600
-I WANTED TO GO
TO THE STORE AND HE DIDN'T.

14:13.700 --> 14:14.633
-WHERE Y'ALL LIVE AT?

14:14.733 --> 14:15.733
-I LIVE RIGHT HERE.

14:15.833 --> 14:17.300
-OKAY. WHERE ARE YOUR SHOES AT?

14:17.400 --> 14:18.867
-OH, THEY'RE IN THE HOUSE.
I WAS JUST WALKING--

14:18.967 --> 14:20.400
-HE DIDN'T WANT ME HERE
'CAUSE I WAS WALKING--

14:20.500 --> 14:21.800
-SHE WAS WALKING
TO THE STORE BY HERSELF.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.433
(both talking)

14:23.533 --> 14:24.867
-I JUST GOT OFF WORK.

14:24.967 --> 14:27.100
-OKAY, WELL, SOMEONE CALLED
'CAUSE THEY WERE CONCERNED.

14:27.200 --> 14:31.100
-SO, I WAS ARGUING WITH HIM
'CAUSE I JUST GOT OFF WORK
FROM THE CHICKEN FARM.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.933
-OKAY.
-AND I WAS GOING
TO THE STORE.

14:33.067 --> 14:34.767
HE DIDN'T WANT ME GOING
BY MYSELF AND HE GOT MAD
AT ME.

14:34.867 --> 14:36.733
-HE CARES ABOUT...
-AIN'T NO BIG PROBLEM.

14:36.833 --> 14:39.633
-YOU WANNA STAND OVER THERE
FOR ME FOR JUST A SECOND?
-YEAH.

14:39.733 --> 14:41.600
-SO, GIVE ME YOUR SIDE.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.200
-WE WAS ARGUING A BIT.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.100
THAT'S ABOUT IT.
-WHAT WAS THE ARGUMENT OVER?

14:45.200 --> 14:48.167
-UH, ME GETTING MY CLOTHES ON.

14:48.267 --> 14:50.867
-I'M SORRY?
-GIVING ME ENOUGH TIME
TO GET MY CLOTHES ON.

14:50.967 --> 14:52.867
I WAS RUNNING UP TO THE STORE.

14:52.967 --> 14:55.067
-WHY WERE YOU RUNNING
AFTER HER?
-TO CATCH UP WITH HER.

14:55.167 --> 14:57.267
-SO, HE WAS RUNNING
TO COME GET YOU.

14:57.367 --> 14:59.667
AND HOW'D AN ARGUMENT ENSUE?

14:59.767 --> 15:01.633
-'CAUSE I TOLD HIM
I WAS THIRSTY.

15:01.733 --> 15:03.967
HE SAID, "YOU KNOW THIS AIN'T
NO GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD TO BE
WALKING AROUND BY YOURSELF."

15:04.067 --> 15:05.267
-I SAID, "LET ME GET
MY CLOTHES ON."

15:05.367 --> 15:06.700
-HEY, LET HER TALK.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.467
-AND I DIDN'T GIVE HIM
ENOUGH TIME TO GET HIS
CLOTHES ON.

15:08.567 --> 15:10.933
HE SAID, "I DON'T WANT YOU
WALKING BY YOURSELF 'CAUSE
IT'S A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD."

15:11.067 --> 15:12.067
AND I COME ANYWAYS.

15:12.167 --> 15:14.100
-SO, WHY WERE WE CALLED?

15:14.200 --> 15:16.133
IF Y'ALL ARE JUST
ARGUING, WHAT...

15:16.233 --> 15:19.133
WHAT LED SOMEBODY COMING
DOWN THE ROAD TO CALL US?

15:19.233 --> 15:21.400
-'CAUSE I TOLD HIM I COULD
WALK ANYWHERE I WANTED.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.200
-HUH?
-'CAUSE I TOLD HIM I COULD WALK
ANYWHERE I WANTED TO.

15:24.300 --> 15:25.933
-OKAY.
-AND IT WASN'T
A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD.

15:26.067 --> 15:27.667
I WAS YELLING AT HIM.

15:27.767 --> 15:30.567
-SO, YOU THINK YOU YELLING AT
HIM CAUSED SOMEBODY TO CALL?

15:30.667 --> 15:31.900
-I MEAN, I WAS
YELLING AT HIM.

15:32.067 --> 15:33.467
-SO, THIS NEVER
TURNED PHYSICAL?

15:33.567 --> 15:34.767
-NO.
-NO, MA'AM.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.967
-'CAUSE SOMEBODY TOLD ME
IT WAS A FIGHT IN PROGRESS.

15:37.067 --> 15:39.200
-I DIDN'T HIT HIM,
HE DIDN'T HIT ME.

15:39.300 --> 15:40.833
-WHAT'S Y'ALL'S RELATIONSHIP?

15:40.933 --> 15:42.067
-BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND.

15:42.167 --> 15:43.433
-HOW LONG Y'ALL BEEN TOGETHER?

15:43.533 --> 15:44.467
-SEVEN YEARS.

15:44.567 --> 15:45.733
-HOW MANY?
-SEVEN.

15:45.833 --> 15:48.100
-SEVEN YEARS. HOW LONG HAVE
Y'ALL LIVED TOGETHER?

15:48.200 --> 15:50.533
-ABOUT SIX.

15:50.633 --> 15:54.267
-SO, THIS CLAIM THAT Y'ALL
WERE FIGHTING IS JUST
NOT REAL?

15:54.367 --> 15:56.433
-NO, IT AIN'T. NO.
-WE WASN'T FIGHTING,
WE WAS ARGUING.

15:56.533 --> 15:59.067
-SO, HE'S UPSET THAT YOU DIDN'T
WAIT FOR HIM TO GET CLOTHES ON,

15:59.133 --> 16:01.100
AND HE DIDN'T WANT YOU TO WALK
ALONE 'CAUSE IT'S DANGEROUS.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.567
Y'ALL GET IN AN ARGUMENT...
-YEAH.

16:02.667 --> 16:04.467
-THEN YOU TURN AROUND
AND COME BACK?
-BUT HE DIDN'T-- YEAH.

16:04.567 --> 16:05.867
-AND THAT'S THE MEAT OF IT?
-YEAH.

16:05.967 --> 16:08.067
-ALL RIGHT, HANG TIGHT
RIGHT HERE FOR A SECOND, OKAY?

16:08.167 --> 16:09.633
-OKAY.

16:09.733 --> 16:11.333
-THEY'RE SAYING
NOTHING HAPPENED.

16:11.433 --> 16:12.967
THE GUY DOWN THERE
SAYS HE HAS VIDEO.

16:13.067 --> 16:14.767
YOU WANNA WAIT WITH THEM
AND I'LL GO DOWN THERE?

16:14.867 --> 16:16.067
-YEAH.

16:16.167 --> 16:17.533
-OKAY.

16:17.633 --> 16:19.300
(car starts)

16:20.567 --> 16:22.867
WE APPARENTLY HAVE A WITNESS
WHO HAS A VIDEO.

16:22.967 --> 16:25.800
SO, WE'RE GONNA SEE IF
WE CAN VALIDATE ANY CLAIMS,

16:25.900 --> 16:27.367
AND WE'LL HAVE TO GO
FROM THERE.

16:27.467 --> 16:30.267
(radio chatter)

16:34.400 --> 16:35.567
-HELLO.
-HEY.

16:35.667 --> 16:36.767
-WHO SAW WHAT HAPPENED?

16:36.867 --> 16:38.933
-HE TOOK A VIDEO.

16:39.067 --> 16:40.567
-OKAY. YOU HAVE YOUR VIDEO?

16:40.667 --> 16:42.133
CAN I SEE THAT?

16:42.233 --> 16:44.067
WHERE WERE THEY
WHEN THIS HAPPENED?

16:44.133 --> 16:45.333
LIKE, AT THE CORNER?

16:45.433 --> 16:47.533
-YES.
-WERE THEY HITTING
ON EACH OTHER?

16:47.633 --> 16:49.133
-HE GOT EVERYTHING
ON THE VIDEO.

16:49.233 --> 16:50.600
-THERE WE GO.

16:50.700 --> 16:54.867
(shouting)

17:04.100 --> 17:07.833
LOOKS LIKE HE'S TRYING
TO KEEP HER FROM GOING
THE WAY SHE'S WANTING,

17:07.933 --> 17:10.933
AND HE KEEPS GRABBING HER,
AND SHE'S TELLING HIM
TO GET OFF OF HER.

17:11.067 --> 17:13.133
UMM, HE JUST PUSHED HER
IN THE HEAD,

17:13.233 --> 17:14.333
AND SHE WALKS OFF.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.700
AND HE'S FOLLOWING HER
AND GRABBING HER AGAIN.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.067
HOW'D Y'ALL GET INVOLVED?

17:18.167 --> 17:20.100
-WE JUST HEARD, LIKE,
VOICES, YOU KNOW?

17:20.200 --> 17:23.267
LIKE, A GUY YELLING AT HER,
BUT WE DON'T...

17:23.367 --> 17:25.267
-DID YOU HEAR
WHAT HE WAS SAYING AT ALL?

17:25.367 --> 17:27.067
-NO, NO.
-YOU JUST HEARD HIM YELLING?

17:27.167 --> 17:28.500
-HE WAS WORKING
ON THESE JET-SKIS,

17:28.600 --> 17:31.300
AND THEN HE JUST JUMPED
ON THE TRUCK AND STARTED,
YOU KNOW...

17:31.400 --> 17:32.367
-OKAY.

17:32.467 --> 17:33.933
-ALL RIGHT, AND WHERE WERE YOU?

17:34.067 --> 17:35.467
-I WAS RIGHT HERE.
-OKAY.

17:35.567 --> 17:37.967
LET ME GET YOU
THE CASE NUMBER REAL QUICK,

17:38.067 --> 17:40.933
AND JUST SAVE THAT VIDEO,
'CAUSE WE'LL NEED A COPY
OF IT, OKAY?

17:43.067 --> 17:45.633
OKAY, LET'S GO OVER HERE
AND TALK.

17:45.733 --> 17:47.167
ALL RIGHT.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.833
TELL THE TRUTH.
-I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

17:48.933 --> 17:52.100
HE WAS PULLING ON MY JACKET,
AND LETTING ME NOT
GO AWAY FROM HIM.

17:52.200 --> 17:55.233
THAT'S ALL HE DID WAS
PULL ON MY JACKET. HE DIDN'T
PUNCH ME, HE DIDN'T HIT ME.

17:55.333 --> 17:57.700
-WELL, I MEAN, I SAW A VIDEO
OF WHAT HE DID.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.100
-HE DIDN'T PUNCH ME
OR NOTHING.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.667
-HE MAY NOT HAVE PUNCHED YOU,
BUT HE HIT YOU IN THE HEAD.

18:01.767 --> 18:03.300
-HE HIT ME IN THE HEAD?

18:03.400 --> 18:06.200
-YEAH, HE OPEN HAND,
JUST IN THE FACE.

18:06.300 --> 18:07.800
OR, SIDE OF THE HEAD.

18:07.900 --> 18:09.133
YOU DON'T REMEMBER THAT?
-NO.

18:09.233 --> 18:11.467
-I WATCHED VIDEO OF IT.

18:11.567 --> 18:13.567
-I MEAN, I KNOW HE WAS
PULLING MY JACKET,

18:13.667 --> 18:15.133
BUT HE DID NOT HIT ME.

18:16.633 --> 18:18.567
-SO, YOU DON'T THINK HE WAS
TRYING TO HURT YOU OR ANYTHING?

18:18.667 --> 18:19.800
-I KNOW HE WASN'T.

18:19.900 --> 18:22.267
HE THOUGHT I WAS MAD ABOUT
HIM SLEEPING ALL DAY.

18:22.367 --> 18:24.833
I DON'T CARE IF HE SLEEPS
ALL DAY, I'M WORKING.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

18:24.933 --> 18:27.300
SO, IT DON'T BOTHER ME IF HE
LAYS IN BED ALL DAMN DAY LONG.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.700
HE HAS NEVER HIT ME THIS WHOLE
TIME WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.233
-ALL RIGHT. HANG OUT RIGHT HERE
FOR ME. DON'T GO BACK OVER
TO HIM.

18:32.333 --> 18:36.267
LET ME TALK TO HIM,
AND GIVE ME A MINUTE.

18:36.367 --> 18:38.233
JUSTIN, STAND UP FOR ME.

18:41.167 --> 18:44.600
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE GOING
TO JAIL, OKAY? YOU'RE BEING
CHARGED WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.167
-CAN I SEE THE VIDEO?

18:51.267 --> 18:53.067
-WELL, I DON'T HAVE
THE VIDEO WITH ME,

18:53.167 --> 18:54.700
BUT I'M SURE...
-MAN, I AIN'T GOT
MY SHOES...

18:54.800 --> 18:57.133
-THE VIDEO WILL
COME UP IN COURT.

18:57.233 --> 19:00.333
THERE'S VIDEO OF YOU
PUTTING YOUR HANDS ON HER, OKAY?

19:00.433 --> 19:02.700
AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE
GONNA HAVE TO WORK OUT IN COURT.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.467
THANK YOU.

19:04.567 --> 19:07.367
ALL RIGHT, IF HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANYBODY TO BOND HIM OUT,

19:07.467 --> 19:10.067
HE'S GONNA SIT, OKAY?

19:10.167 --> 19:12.500
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
GOOD LUCK TO YOU, CRYSTAL.

19:12.600 --> 19:13.833
-THANK YOU.

19:13.933 --> 19:15.300
-WILL YOU MEET ME OVER THERE?
-YEAH.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.400
-NO, I AIN'T--

19:16.500 --> 19:17.833
-THERE'S VIDEO
OF WHAT HAPPENED.

19:17.933 --> 19:19.167
-BUT I DIDN'T PUT MY...

19:19.267 --> 19:20.733
-YOU NEVER PUT YOUR HANDS
ON HER?

19:20.833 --> 19:24.467
-I TOLD YOU WHAT I DID TO HER...
WHAT I DID. THAT'S ALL.

19:24.567 --> 19:26.467
-DID YOU PUSH HER,
PUNCH HER, ANY OF THAT?

19:26.567 --> 19:28.433
-NO, I DIDN'T PUNCH HER.

19:28.533 --> 19:29.700
-WHAT ABOUT PUSH HER?

19:29.800 --> 19:31.767
-SHE'D TELL YOU
IF I PUNCHED HER.

19:31.867 --> 19:33.833
-WELL, WHAT ABOUT PUSH HER?

19:33.933 --> 19:35.667
-I PUSHED HER
PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT.

19:35.767 --> 19:38.767
-WHY? WHAT WERE YOU TRYING
TO GET OUT OF PUSHING HER?

19:38.867 --> 19:40.667
-I AIN'T TRYING TO GET
NOTHING OUT OF PUSHING HER.

19:40.767 --> 19:42.433
-I AIN'T PUSHED HER
LIKE YOU THINK I PUSHED HER.

19:42.533 --> 19:44.400
-ALL RIGHT, WELL,
VIDEO SAYS DIFFERENT,

19:44.500 --> 19:47.433
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE CHARGED,
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

19:48.833 --> 19:49.867
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:49.967 --> 19:51.533
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:51.633 --> 19:53.300
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.333
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:54.433 --> 19:57.400
-(overlapping

20:02.933 --> 20:04.867
