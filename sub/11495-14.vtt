09:16.599 --> 09:18.248
Oh, my God, what happened?

09:18.250 --> 09:21.352
Yeah, I had a moment of weakness
with my receptionist.

09:21.354 --> 09:24.888
Actually, 36 and a half
moments of weakness.

09:24.890 --> 09:26.106
Uh, a half?

09:26.108 --> 09:28.425
Judith walked in during 37.

09:28.427 --> 09:31.278
Herb, how could you?

09:33.531 --> 09:35.115
This is my receptionist.

09:36.484 --> 09:39.436
I would have finished 37
while she was watching.

Hey, man, thanks
for inviting me over.

09:54.108 --> 09:54.942
I really appreciate it.

09:54.943 --> 09:57.476
Ah, come on, you'd do
the same thing for me.

09:57.478 --> 09:58.995
We both know
that's not true,

09:58.997 --> 10:00.663
but it's sweet
of you to say.

10:01.488 --> 10:03.755
And besides, breakups
are like a bruise,

10:03.757 --> 10:04.923
and I want to be there

10:04.925 --> 10:07.625
when yours turns
from dark purple to yellow.

10:07.627 --> 10:11.079
That is the meanest thing
you've ever said.

10:11.081 --> 10:14.549
Kudos.

10:14.551 --> 10:16.617
Okay, here's
a question:

10:16.619 --> 10:19.170
who's your
dream schtupp?

10:19.172 --> 10:20.588
What?

10:20.590 --> 10:23.475
Any woman in the world, one
night, who's it going to be?

10:23.477 --> 10:25.226
Oh, that's easy: Kate.

10:25.228 --> 10:26.428
Oh, see, right there.

10:26.430 --> 10:27.846
That's why I wouldn't
have you over.

10:27.848 --> 10:29.464
Who picks their
ex-girlfriend?

10:29.466 --> 10:32.934
I mean, I'm talking
any woman in the world.

10:32.936 --> 10:33.985
Okay, dead or alive?

10:33.987 --> 10:35.603
It doesn't matter.

10:35.605 --> 10:37.655
Do I have to know her?
Nope.

10:37.657 --> 10:38.973
What if she
doesn't like me?

10:38.975 --> 10:40.641
I... for the
love of God.

10:40.643 --> 10:42.694
In the game
she has to like you.

10:42.696 --> 10:44.312
Okay.

10:44.314 --> 10:45.497
Can she be animated?

10:45.499 --> 10:47.648
Like a-like a cartoon?

10:47.650 --> 10:49.817
What? You want to be chomped
by Ms. Pacman?

10:49.819 --> 10:52.087
No, but I always had
these weird feelings

10:52.089 --> 10:54.489
when I used to see
Bugs Bunny in drag.

10:54.491 --> 10:56.925
Fine, she can
be animated.

10:56.927 --> 10:58.009
Her place or mine?

10:58.011 --> 10:59.377
Who cares?

10:59.379 --> 11:00.762
I do.

11:00.764 --> 11:02.497
It's hard for me to relax
in strange surroundings.

11:02.499 --> 11:03.831
Okay, you know what?
Just forget it.

11:03.833 --> 11:05.233
But-but I didn't
pick a girl.

11:05.235 --> 11:08.186
Just shut up.
You ruin everything.

11:08.188 --> 11:10.105
Mother Teresa.

11:10.107 --> 11:12.273
What?!

11:12.275 --> 11:14.642
That woman gave her whole life

11:14.644 --> 11:16.677
for the benefit of mankind.

11:16.679 --> 11:19.680
And one man should give her
a little something back.

11:20.900 --> 11:22.450
Hey, guys.

11:22.452 --> 11:24.185
Oh, hey. Hi.
Hey!

11:24.187 --> 11:29.290
Oh, Alan's girlfriend is taller
than I would have thought.

11:29.292 --> 11:31.793
Herb, uh, you remember Walden.
This is Billy.

11:31.795 --> 11:33.161
Oh. Hello, Billy.

11:33.163 --> 11:35.580
Alan tells me you got, uh,
dumped by Walden's ex-wife.

11:36.632 --> 11:38.699
Yeah. I got dumped
by Alan's ex-wife.

11:39.702 --> 11:41.569
I guess
that makes us dump brothers.

11:41.571 --> 11:42.921
That's, uh...

11:42.923 --> 11:44.055
Who is this guy?

11:44.057 --> 11:47.208
You don't recognize
your own dump brother?

11:47.210 --> 11:49.160
Herb is the most recent victim

11:49.162 --> 11:51.679
of Judith's unrelenting assault
on mankind.

11:51.681 --> 11:54.349
Oh, it sounds like just the
kind of horrible ball-breaker

11:54.351 --> 11:55.683
I always end up with.

11:55.685 --> 11:56.851
Mm-hmm.

11:56.853 --> 11:58.653
She available?

11:58.655 --> 12:00.572
Not emotionally.

12:00.574 --> 12:02.657
And she's only physically
available twice a year.

12:02.659 --> 12:05.276
Twice?
Uh, birthdays and Valentine's Day.

12:05.278 --> 12:06.611
Oh, that explains it.

12:06.613 --> 12:09.581
My birthday's
<i>on</i> Valentine's Day.

12:09.583 --> 12:12.367
I thought you were going
to see Lyndsey.

12:12.369 --> 12:15.236
I did... right as she was
going out on a date.

12:15.238 --> 12:16.621
Yikes.
Gut-punch.

12:16.623 --> 12:18.339
With her gynecologist.

12:18.341 --> 12:20.258
Shut up!

12:20.260 --> 12:21.409
What?

12:21.411 --> 12:23.411
That man is a trained
vagina handler.

12:23.413 --> 12:25.096
You do not want
him down there.

12:25.098 --> 12:27.265
He-He's already <i>been</i> down there.

12:27.267 --> 12:28.533
Yeah, on business.

12:28.535 --> 12:31.269
You don't want him to return
on a pleasure cruise.

12:31.271 --> 12:32.804
I mean, I mean,

12:32.806 --> 12:34.139
he could take apart

12:34.141 --> 12:36.141
and reassemble her undercarriage
blindfolded.

12:36.143 --> 12:37.559
You're more like a guy trying

12:37.561 --> 12:39.460
to put a bookshelf
together from IKEA.

12:39.462 --> 12:41.863
Well, you know what?
I don't care. I don't need her.

12:41.865 --> 12:43.598
That's a good attitude.
Mm-hmm.

12:43.600 --> 12:44.732
Exactly. Who needs women?

12:44.734 --> 12:46.151
Not me.
Me, neither. Uh-uh.

12:48.654 --> 12:50.705
Know what we should do?

12:50.707 --> 12:52.113
Go to a bar and pick
up some women?

12:52.138 --> 12:53.699
Yup.

12:56.912 --> 12:59.047
All right, this is not gonna be
that hard.

12:59.049 --> 13:01.249
I mean, look at us.
We've got a doctor,

13:01.251 --> 13:03.084
a billionaire,
another billionaire.

13:03.086 --> 13:05.053
Billionaire's
permanent houseguest.

13:05.055 --> 13:07.121
Ooh, he said I'm permanent.

13:08.174 --> 13:10.925
Check out the talent
at three o'clock.

13:10.927 --> 13:12.093
Oh.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.645
Oh, oh, oh.

13:13.647 --> 13:16.231
Hotsy-totsy!

13:16.233 --> 13:17.965
Oh, I got dibs on the blonde.

13:17.967 --> 13:19.984
Oh, who's taking the manly one?
What manly one?

13:19.986 --> 13:22.187
Herb's got the one
with the Adam's apple.

13:23.572 --> 13:25.490
Okay, what are we gonna do
here, guys?

13:25.492 --> 13:26.941
You know, uh, what's the plan?

13:26.943 --> 13:28.276
I mean, uh, teams of two,

13:28.278 --> 13:30.161
every man for himself,
uh, shock and awe?

13:30.163 --> 13:32.413
Or we just send in
the tall, handsome guy

13:32.415 --> 13:33.748
with the big johnson.

13:33.750 --> 13:35.200
I'll see what I can do.

13:35.202 --> 13:37.818
Oh, not you.
Pretty boy here.

13:37.820 --> 13:40.371
Well, I am more
than just a pretty face.

13:40.373 --> 13:43.174
Come on, man. You can be
like the-the great white shark,

13:43.176 --> 13:45.093
and we'll be
the plucky little pilot fish

13:45.095 --> 13:47.212
who swim alongside you
and feed off your scraps.

13:47.214 --> 13:50.381
Why do I have to be cursed
with all of this?

13:50.383 --> 13:52.517
Back off.

13:52.519 --> 13:54.419
I will seal the deal.

13:56.021 --> 13:57.522
I've seen this movie before.

13:57.524 --> 14:00.058
You're going to enjoy it.

14:01.520 --> 14:02.919
Hi. I hate to interrupt,

14:02.921 --> 14:05.271
so I'm just gonna cut
right to the chase.

14:05.273 --> 14:08.525
I'm neither tall, nor handsome,
but I'm incredibly rich.

14:08.527 --> 14:11.945
So which of you
would like the honor

14:11.947 --> 14:16.533
of sleeping with me
for... $5,000?

14:19.370 --> 14:21.905
I apologize.

14:21.907 --> 14:24.073
Ten thousand.

14:35.669 --> 14:37.670
Gentlemen,

14:37.672 --> 14:40.640
the bar has been lowered.

14:43.460 --> 14:45.461
This is a great idea, Herb.

14:45.463 --> 14:48.064
Yeah, but we shouldn't
call him Herb.

14:48.066 --> 14:49.632
We should call him Erb.

14:51.469 --> 14:52.919
Well, as a doctor,

14:52.921 --> 14:55.905
I have access to some
pretty righteous chronic.

14:55.907 --> 14:57.190
You're a pediatrician.

14:57.192 --> 14:58.741
I prescribe it to the parents.

14:58.743 --> 15:00.326
Hmm.

15:00.328 --> 15:01.477
This would be way better

15:01.479 --> 15:03.162
if there were four
hot women in here.

15:03.164 --> 15:05.147
Yeah, and none of you.

15:05.149 --> 15:07.917
Please, the only way
you could satisfy four women

15:07.919 --> 15:09.619
is if they were cannibals.

15:09.621 --> 15:11.454
Okay.

15:11.456 --> 15:13.339
Yeah. Look,
I will have you know,

15:13.341 --> 15:15.508
I have no <i>trouble</i> satisfying
multiple women.

15:15.510 --> 15:17.544
In fact,
that's kind of the reason

15:17.546 --> 15:20.096
I ended in this big bowl
of sausage soup.

15:20.098 --> 15:21.831
What do you mean?

15:21.833 --> 15:25.835
Bridget and I would enjoy
the occasional threesome.

15:25.837 --> 15:29.105
And by "occasional,"
I mean every Friday, Saturday,

15:29.107 --> 15:30.390
and Sunday night.

15:30.392 --> 15:32.942
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Bridget, like, my Bridget?

15:32.944 --> 15:35.177
Yup. She was a weekend warrior.

15:35.179 --> 15:38.698
Wow. The closest we ever
came to a threesome

15:38.700 --> 15:42.235
was one time we dog-sat, and I
left the bedroom door open.

15:42.237 --> 15:43.987
Me and that beagle
made eye contact

15:43.989 --> 15:46.623
at the most inopportune moment.

15:46.625 --> 15:48.541
Oh, my God.

15:48.543 --> 15:50.810
Well, hey, hey, hey--
one word of advice.

15:50.812 --> 15:53.296
Do not look up
from the lap of a girl

15:53.298 --> 15:56.165
you just picked up at Safeway
and say to your girlfriend,

15:56.167 --> 15:59.252
"My God, I never
want this to end!"

16:00.421 --> 16:02.171
Aah, threesomes never work out.

16:02.173 --> 16:03.840
Somebody always feels left out.

16:03.842 --> 16:06.809
That's why my receptionist and I
got another couple and swing.

16:06.811 --> 16:09.929
Ooh! Stringbean's a freak.
I like it.

16:09.931 --> 16:12.315
Yeah, if you and, uh,
Bridget ever get back together,

16:12.317 --> 16:15.051
maybe she'd like
to become a Herbivore.

16:16.570 --> 16:18.571
I will keep that in mind.

16:19.356 --> 16:20.890
Okay, so I lied

16:20.892 --> 16:23.443
to the woman I love
about who I am.

16:23.445 --> 16:24.727
Herb cheated on his wife.

16:24.729 --> 16:25.995
And Billy spent
too much time

16:25.997 --> 16:27.614
yodeling in
the wrong canyon.

16:29.033 --> 16:31.734
Why did you and Lyndsey
break up?

16:31.736 --> 16:34.504
She wanted a key to the house.

16:37.591 --> 16:38.591
And?

16:38.593 --> 16:41.260
And I said no.

16:41.262 --> 16:42.512
Why?

16:42.514 --> 16:44.047
Well, it's-it's not mine
to give.

16:44.049 --> 16:45.581
It's your house.

16:45.583 --> 16:47.717
Since when does that matter
to you?

16:47.719 --> 16:49.852
Since I don't want my girlfriend

16:49.854 --> 16:52.388
to have unrestricted access
to my house.

16:52.390 --> 16:54.941
And we're back to <i>your</i> house.

16:54.943 --> 16:56.442
I like my space!

16:56.444 --> 16:58.394
I-I want to keep
my options open.

16:58.396 --> 17:01.981
Options? You have op-shun.

17:01.983 --> 17:06.703
<i>Shun.</i> As in,
all other girls <i>shun</i> you.

17:06.704 --> 17:07.954
Look, Alan,

17:07.955 --> 17:09.204
don't be a schmuck.

17:09.207 --> 17:10.990
If you're gonna throw away
your relationship,

17:10.992 --> 17:12.325
do it for a good reason.

17:12.327 --> 17:15.962
Like spending too much time
face down in the checkout girl.

17:15.964 --> 17:17.780
Yeah, or, uh, fooling around

17:17.781 --> 17:19.448
with your hot,
young receptionist

17:19.450 --> 17:22.551
who lets you wear a diaper while
riding her around the office.

17:25.339 --> 17:27.473
Is one example.

17:27.474 --> 17:30.309
Nobody's gonna think about that
next time we see you.

17:31.645 --> 17:33.629
My point is,
you're the only one of us

17:33.631 --> 17:35.515
who has a chance
to get his girl back.

17:35.517 --> 17:37.483
What about all that stuff
about not needing women?

17:37.485 --> 17:40.069
We only said that
because we don't <i>have</i> women.

17:40.071 --> 17:42.605
Really?
Of course. Lyndsey is <i>awesome.</i>

17:42.607 --> 17:44.824
She really is.
She's got the face of an angel,

17:44.826 --> 17:47.076
buttocks you can bounce
a quarter off,

17:47.078 --> 17:49.829
and a bosom that just makes you
wish she was your mother.

17:52.533 --> 17:54.150
But I'm saying she's awesome.

17:54.152 --> 17:57.453
Just give her the key, Alan.
Give her anything she wants.

17:57.455 --> 17:59.372
Well, it's a little late.
She's out with another guy.

17:59.374 --> 18:00.873
Well, no, it's not too late.

18:00.875 --> 18:03.593
Go get her.
Go do it for yourself.

18:03.595 --> 18:05.828
Do it for all of us
who can't get our girl back.

18:05.830 --> 18:07.046
Yeah!
Come on, go get her.

18:07.048 --> 18:08.347
Okay, okay, you're right.
Yeah.

18:08.349 --> 18:09.632
You're right.
I'm gonna do it!

18:09.634 --> 18:11.634
I'm gonna do it for all of us!
There you go.

18:40.698 --> 18:42.165
Were you peeing in my bushes?

18:42.167 --> 18:44.200
What? No. No. Hi. I'm, uh...

18:44.202 --> 18:45.384
I'm Alan Harper.

18:45.386 --> 18:46.886
No thanks.

18:46.888 --> 18:48.888
Alan, this is not a good time.

18:48.890 --> 18:50.056
Okay, just-just hear me out,
okay?

18:50.058 --> 18:51.090
Look, she said this
wasn't a good time.

18:51.092 --> 18:52.091
Get him!

18:52.093 --> 18:54.477
Whoa, whoa.
Walden, what are you doing?

18:54.479 --> 18:56.803
You'll thank us later.
What are you doing? Put me down.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.853
- Who are you?
- You look lovely, Lyndsey.

18:58.855 --> 19:01.072
What the hell is going on?

19:01.074 --> 19:02.723
I swear I had nothing
to do with this.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.442
Why did they just take
my date away?

19:04.444 --> 19:06.277
Don't worry. I think
they're just trying to help.

19:06.279 --> 19:07.612
Help with what?

19:07.614 --> 19:09.997
Okay, I-I know this seems crazy,

19:09.999 --> 19:13.367
but I've been doing
a lot of thinking and... here.

19:13.369 --> 19:15.169
What's this?

19:15.171 --> 19:16.554
A key to the house.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.072
I want you to have it.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.256
Really?

19:19.258 --> 19:20.808
Yes, yes,
you're my girlfriend.

19:20.810 --> 19:23.210
Mi casa es su casa.

19:23.212 --> 19:24.211
Actually,

19:24.213 --> 19:26.180
mi casa es Walden's casa

19:26.182 --> 19:27.581
es su casa.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.518
I think I went to high school
with a Sue Casa.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.920
Which is ironic,
because she ended up homeless.

19:32.922 --> 19:33.888
Sorry.

19:33.890 --> 19:35.106
Anyway, the point is,

19:35.108 --> 19:37.141
the key is yours.

19:37.143 --> 19:39.143
What made you change your mind?

19:39.145 --> 19:40.594
I love you, Lyndsey.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.064
What really made you
change your mind?

19:43.066 --> 19:45.066
All right, here we go.

19:45.068 --> 19:48.869
The fact that while you could
certainly do better,

19:48.871 --> 19:51.539
there's no way I ever could.

19:51.541 --> 19:54.041
Alan, that is so sweet.

19:54.043 --> 19:56.160
And so true.

19:57.713 --> 19:59.997
So I know Herb and Walden,

19:59.999 --> 20:02.249
but who's the lesbian
in the bathrobe?

20:02.251 --> 20:05.136
♪ <i>Men.</i> ♪

20:11.391 --> 20:12.654
Sorry about kidnapping you.

20:12.711 --> 20:13.793
Ah, don't worry about it.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.962
It was never gonna work
with Lyndsey and me.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.281
Outside of her vagina,
we have nothing in common.

20:18.283 --> 20:19.466
Doctor to doctor,

20:19.468 --> 20:21.084
can I ask you
a medical question?

20:21.086 --> 20:22.836
Is it beautiful?

20:22.838 --> 20:24.137
Herb.

20:24.139 --> 20:25.755
Sorry about that,
Dr. Staven.

20:25.757 --> 20:27.891
Oh, please, call me Steven.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.676
Well, Steven Staven?

20:29.678 --> 20:31.895
It's made me
a stronger person.

20:31.897 --> 20:35.098
You know, you wear that robe
better than Judith ever did.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.900
Really? I feel boxy.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.802
No, no.

20:39.496 --> 20:40.762
What was that?

20:41.849 --> 20:44.133
Uh-oh.

20:44.767 --> 20:45.767
Oh, crap.

20:45.769 --> 20:46.935
Run, Steven Staven!

20:46.937 --> 20:48.270
Run!

20:48.272 --> 20:49.855
Oh, wait!

20:49.857 --> 20:50.939
Herb's down!

20:50.941 --> 20:52.141
Leave him!

20:52.143 --> 20:53.358
Oh, dear God,
help me!

20:54.553 --> 20:55.969
Tell Lyndsey
I love her!

20:55.971 --> 21:00.971
