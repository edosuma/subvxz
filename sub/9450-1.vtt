00:31.658 --> 00:34.536
I don't want her living here,
that's all.

00:47.382 --> 00:52.052
Boy. What a great night
for a race, Stitch?

00:52.053 --> 00:54.430
Remember, there's ten roofs.
No stopping.

00:54.431 --> 00:57.266
- We know the rules.
- All right. Start the race.

00:57.267 --> 00:59.810
- Let's go.
- You got the money at the other end?

00:59.811 --> 01:02.062
- Start the race.
- You got the five bucks?

01:02.063 --> 01:04.440
Get over there, greaseball.

01:04.441 --> 01:07.192
Once more with the rules.
Ten roofs, no stopping.

01:07.193 --> 01:10.320
- We know the rules.
- You got the $5 at the other end?

01:10.321 --> 01:15.994
- Will you get down? Let's go. It's there.
- All right, I'm game. Let's start the race.

01:18.079 --> 01:22.291
- You're a brave boy, speedo.
- I'm faster than you, meatball.

01:22.292 --> 01:25.545
On your marks, get set... go!

04:56.256 --> 04:58.715
Hey, nice try, Rat!

04:58.716 --> 05:01.051
I'll get you, greaseball!

05:01.052 --> 05:03.513
Yeah? See you around!

05:38.339 --> 05:41.216
Please help me.
Thank you, ma'am.

05:41.217 --> 05:42.885
Thank you.

05:47.682 --> 05:49.850
Please help me.
Somebody, please.

05:49.851 --> 05:52.562
OK, Cos.

05:55.356 --> 05:58.318
Thank you. Thank you, everybody.

06:12.582 --> 06:14.374
Times is tough.

06:14.375 --> 06:18.045
When a guy can't make peanuts
as a cripple, the world's getting cheap.

06:18.046 --> 06:20.214
How much you make today?

06:21.299 --> 06:24.009
- Millions.
- Millions!

06:24.010 --> 06:26.054
Get out of here.

06:38.483 --> 06:41.402
Hey, Vic! Stop this crate!

06:47.492 --> 06:49.785
Annie O'Sherlock.

06:49.786 --> 06:53.121
- How about a lift with a gentleman?
- I thought you were in jail.

06:53.122 --> 06:57.417
- Not yet. A lift with a gentleman?
- Know where one is?

06:57.418 --> 07:01.296
- Hey, listen. I'm shooting up in this world.
- A regular rocket?

07:01.297 --> 07:05.133
I don't wanna brag, but I'm the
most promising human in Hell's Kitchen.

07:05.134 --> 07:06.802
Come on, Cosmo, I'm late.

07:06.803 --> 07:10.347
I'll walk along. This place is
crawling with desperate characters.

07:10.348 --> 07:13.475
- Desperate as you?
- I ain't desperate, I'm in love.

07:13.476 --> 07:17.729
- Back it up. You're wilting my permanent.
- Hey, Annie! Hey, listen.

07:17.730 --> 07:21.108
You're too nice a dish to have
them dime-a-dance creeps mauling ya.

07:21.109 --> 07:24.528
You should only associate
with businessmen such as myself.

07:24.529 --> 07:29.408
You got a lot of style for a guy with
pigeon crap on your shoulder, Cosmo.

07:29.409 --> 07:32.494
That ain't real pigeon crap.

07:32.495 --> 07:36.915
That's a little something I had sown on
to make me stand out in the crowd.

07:36.916 --> 07:40.544
How about I come by
and see you at Sticky's at ten tonight?

07:40.545 --> 07:43.296
If you still want.

07:43.297 --> 07:46.508
God. "If I still want"?

07:46.509 --> 07:49.094
Everybody needs something.

07:49.095 --> 07:53.558
And what you need is a lot of me,
wrapped around you on a cold night.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.312
How about I see you at ten, OK?

08:00.773 --> 08:03.150
I'd like to mangle
every pigeon in town.

08:03.151 --> 08:07.070
Ain't Annie got great yams? With
them legs, she's built for a long race.

08:07.071 --> 08:10.283
You need some help?
Good. Hire a partner.

08:14.203 --> 08:17.414
How much ice today, Mr Gaimbelli?

08:17.415 --> 08:20.125
- How much ice, Pop?
- Just the two.

08:20.126 --> 08:22.419
- Just the two.
- Just the two.

08:22.420 --> 08:24.297
Just the two.

08:27.049 --> 08:31.928
"Just the two." Nice place.
Remind me to throw a party here, will ya?

08:31.929 --> 08:36.558
- What are you doing?
- I don't walk behind. I ain't no fart catcher.

08:42.273 --> 08:44.150
What's buzzing?

08:45.610 --> 08:50.698
Nothing's buzzing.
Just throw the ice in the box, Victor.

08:51.824 --> 08:54.576
- Hey, who's the new stiff?
- That's El Zuppa.

08:54.577 --> 08:57.871
El Zuppa? The organ grinder
who worked on 49th Street? Yeah?

08:57.872 --> 09:01.249
- What happened to his monkey?
- Somebody took it, I guess.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.084
- Is that a fact?
- That's a fact.

09:03.085 --> 09:06.379
Is that a fact? Damn.
I could've used that monkey.

09:06.380 --> 09:09.674
- You don't like animals.
- I ain't keen on your licebag bird.

09:09.675 --> 09:12.636
But El Zuppa's monkey
has real class, real talent.

09:12.637 --> 09:15.138
- Bella's no licebag.
- Look, Victor.

09:15.139 --> 09:18.517
Victor, I don't wanna hurt you,
but if you love that bird,

09:18.518 --> 09:24.564
the nicest thing you could do is take it to
a butcher and have it hacked into a meal.

09:24.565 --> 09:27.568
- Cosmo.
- Where's your sense of humour?

09:29.904 --> 09:32.113
Getting ripe, ain't he?

09:32.114 --> 09:33.490
- Don't start.
- What?

09:33.491 --> 09:36.910
- Don't bad-talk dead people.
- What are you grunting about?

09:36.911 --> 09:40.665
- Leave him alone.
- It's OK. I'm not annoyed.

09:43.167 --> 09:45.043
"Annoyed"?

09:45.044 --> 09:49.047
A-nnoyed? And where did you
find this word "annoyed"?

09:49.048 --> 09:53.301
- The dictionary. Susan's teaching me.
- That Chink is teaching you to be witty?

09:53.302 --> 09:55.845
- You just don't give anybody a break.
- What?

09:55.846 --> 09:58.515
We're brothers.
That ever mean anything to you?

09:58.516 --> 10:00.934
Yes, it does.
It means a lot to me.

10:00.935 --> 10:04.855
It means there's a lot of bananas
hanging off the family tree.

10:05.022 --> 10:09.109
This place is starting to annoy me.
I'll see you whizzos tonight at Mahon's.

10:09.110 --> 10:12.821
And in case you ever get lonely,
I want you to meet Muriel.

10:12.822 --> 10:15.448
I'll see you guys later.

10:15.449 --> 10:16.783
- Hey, Lenny.
- What?

10:16.784 --> 10:20.370
- Will you do Charlie Chaplin?
- I got work.

10:20.371 --> 10:22.205
OK, here.

10:22.206 --> 10:24.250
Here's Charlie Chaplin.

10:32.508 --> 10:35.093
- Does that make you happy?
- Yeah.

10:35.094 --> 10:37.138
OK. I'll see you tonight.

11:11.672 --> 11:14.216
Your dime's up, your time's up.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.858
How are you doing, sweetie?

11:38.407 --> 11:41.951
- Don't give the customers a hard time.
- He was pawing me, Sticky.

11:41.952 --> 11:45.539
So what?
And no drinking on the job, either.

11:47.792 --> 11:51.879
- I'm mending a broken heart.
- Don't get fresh!

11:52.630 --> 11:55.090
You see that guy over there?

11:55.091 --> 11:57.509
He'll give you 20 bucks
for a good time.

11:57.510 --> 12:01.262
Two tens. 20 ones.

12:01.263 --> 12:04.141
Clean it up, Sticky.

12:05.434 --> 12:08.520
Come here.
You see that guy over there?

12:08.521 --> 12:11.940
$2 for a good time. Eight quarters.

12:11.941 --> 12:17.070
Maybe if you shave your legs,
he'll give you 20 cents. Four nickels.

12:17.071 --> 12:19.447
- Clean it up, Sticky.
- "Clean it up."

12:19.448 --> 12:23.159
lam clean. This is a clean joint.
You! Get out of here, you pervert!

12:23.160 --> 12:25.705
We don't have any girls to sell here!

13:08.414 --> 13:11.291
- We're going to the dogs.
- What?

13:11.292 --> 13:15.628
We're going to the dogs. I'm glad Ma and
Pa ain't alive to see how their boys is.

13:15.629 --> 13:19.632
- What's bothering you?
- The Carbonis were meant to go places.

13:19.633 --> 13:23.470
I'm a struggling businessman,
this guy hauls ice like a dumb Eskimo,

13:23.471 --> 13:26.431
and you throw stiffs in a crate.
A very classy crew.

13:26.432 --> 13:29.934
- We're holding our own.
- We're holding garbage.

13:29.935 --> 13:33.856
Yeah, you look rich.
We oughta rob somebody.

13:34.482 --> 13:36.858
- I'm not robbing nobody.
- We need money.

13:36.859 --> 13:39.861
Well, cut your hair.
Somebody will give you a job.

13:39.862 --> 13:43.656
- Come on, it's a trademark.
- Yeah, and get rid of that earring.

13:43.657 --> 13:47.077
You think you're some kind of a pirate?

13:56.796 --> 13:59.464
- Speaking of worms...
- What?

13:59.465 --> 14:02.134
Stitch Mahon and his gang.

14:05.513 --> 14:09.433
- So?
- They got El Zuppa's monkey with them.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.688
All right, you vermin. Out.

14:17.942 --> 14:21.736
Hey, Vic.
That monkey could be worth big dough.

14:21.737 --> 14:23.988
You see whose shoulder
the monkey's on?

14:23.989 --> 14:26.199
- Franky the Thumper. So what?
- So what?

14:26.200 --> 14:28.368
- So what?
- Anybody else wanna say it?

14:28.369 --> 14:31.996
You just get clever.
Mahon will have Franky remove your face.

14:31.997 --> 14:34.249
Them bums
swiped that valuable animal.

14:34.250 --> 14:38.753
Hey, Vic. You know Stitch always says
no one can beat Franky at arm wrestling?

14:38.754 --> 14:42.549
- If you win, he'll give me the monkey.
- Don't mix with Stitch.

14:42.550 --> 14:48.888
Lenny, the trouble with you is you weren't
born with no sporting blood, not a drop.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.892
Sit tight. Let me handle this.

15:01.694 --> 15:04.195
How you doing, Stitch?
You're looking swell.

15:04.196 --> 15:07.073
Mr Mahon, would you put a drink
on your kid here?

15:07.074 --> 15:11.327
I own this joint, Cosmo.
I don't need no free drinks.

15:11.328 --> 15:15.291
- So what do you want?
- Just shooting the breeze.

15:19.879 --> 15:23.464
Well, go shoot it some wheres else.

15:23.465 --> 15:26.092
Daddy, give me
the night's take, will ya?

15:26.093 --> 15:30.389
Hey, Stitch, how do you always manage
to stay in such great shape?

15:30.973 --> 15:33.017
Avoiding wops.

15:37.062 --> 15:41.065
I know what you mean. This
neighbourhoods crawling with foreigners.

15:41.066 --> 15:45.528
You know how you always say Franky's
the strongest guy in the neighbourhood?

15:45.529 --> 15:47.697
Do you really believe that tripe?

15:47.698 --> 15:52.535
I'll slap your chain out,
you sideshow-looking freak!

15:52.536 --> 15:56.623
Hey, Frank. Franky, I know
you're a great wrestler, but my brother,

15:56.624 --> 16:00.043
who ain't as handsome as you,
is as strong as Charles Atlas.

16:00.044 --> 16:04.380
- Your brother is a moron.
- Nah, he ain't no moron.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.716
I said he's a moron.

16:06.717 --> 16:09.844
So he ain't no flamin' wit,
but first thing in the morning,

16:09.845 --> 16:14.432
he can haul over 450 pounds of ice up
five flights without blowing his breakfast.

16:14.433 --> 16:16.727
Can he do that?

16:20.648 --> 16:24.359
You know, Frank,
this morning I couldn't wait to shave,

16:24.360 --> 16:26.569
come in here,
and get mangled by you.

16:26.570 --> 16:30.448
Thank you, Franky. You've made me
so very happy. What do you say?

16:30.449 --> 16:35.954
No more of the punching. I'm just chewing
a friendly rag with Stitch. Right, Stitch?

16:35.955 --> 16:39.082
- Cut your hair, jerk.
- Cut your hair, greaseball.

16:39.083 --> 16:42.670
- It's a trademark. Come on, Stitch.
- Cut your hair, jerk.

16:43.295 --> 16:45.880
Enough!

16:45.881 --> 16:50.009
<i>1 think you're sucking wind.</i>

16:50.010 --> 16:53.888
- "Sucking wind"?
- You're sucking wind.

16:53.889 --> 16:58.267
No, no.
"Sucking wind" ain't my specialty.

16:58.268 --> 17:01.772
I got business to talk...
big business.

17:02.982 --> 17:04.440
You? Business?

17:04.441 --> 17:07.902
Yeah. How about I bet
a hundred dollars against that monkey

17:07.903 --> 17:12.573
that my brother, Victor, can whip
Franky the Thumper at arm wrestling?

17:14.867 --> 17:18.830
Why don't you step into my office?
It's that-away.

17:23.127 --> 17:28.214
How you doing, Vic? Franky here wants
to have a friendly arm-wrestling match.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.384
- Nonsense. You can still back out.
- Who rattled your cage?

17:31.385 --> 17:34.220
- I'm looking out for Victor.
- Let's go!

17:34.221 --> 17:36.055
We're getting there.

17:36.056 --> 17:40.393
Listen, I just bet a hundred bucks
against that monkey. I ain't got a dime.

17:40.394 --> 17:44.897
If you don't win, these creeps will drag me
in the alley and tie knots in my spine.

17:44.898 --> 17:49.235
Not that I can't handle it,
but who needs the midnight exercise?

17:49.236 --> 17:53.365
- Let's go!
- We're getting there. Come on.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.119
Come on, get out of here.

18:00.497 --> 18:03.374
Come on, Vic. Take a seat.

18:03.375 --> 18:06.753
Don't forget,
it's a hundred bucks against that monkey.

18:06.754 --> 18:08.755
- I can't start.
- Why not?

18:08.756 --> 18:11.382
- I can't start till Bella's come.
- Give me this.

18:11.383 --> 18:15.053
What's your mother doing
flapping around in a cage?

18:15.054 --> 18:19.850
- You better leave mothers out of it.
- You got anything else to say, gimp?

18:24.229 --> 18:26.940
Hey, Stitch.
Let's leave mothers out of it, OK?

18:28.275 --> 18:30.318
Ready, punk?

18:30.319 --> 18:33.363
Hey, you know,
the word "punk" is a noun.

18:38.035 --> 18:41.997
Shut your hole... puke!

18:51.465 --> 18:53.925
Yeah, you know something?
You are puke.

18:53.926 --> 18:59.056
Hey, Stitch, what do you say
we get this happy contest rolling here?

19:10.984 --> 19:15.029
Come on, Vic! Come on, Victor!

19:15.030 --> 19:18.908
Will you let my brother breathe?
You're sucking up all the good air.

19:18.909 --> 19:21.077
Cosmo, you better have that dough

19:21.078 --> 19:25.457
or you're gonna be spending
a lot of time doing a lot of healing.

20:38.322 --> 20:40.616
Come on, Vic.

20:51.710 --> 20:55.630
Lenny, it's becoming
a desperate situation.

20:55.631 --> 20:58.257
You've gotta do something now.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.052
Please.

21:09.937 --> 21:11.563
Victor.

21:12.356 --> 21:14.900
Victor, you can win if you want to.

21:15.984 --> 21:19.654
You can win this. I believe in you
and Cosmo believes in you.

21:19.655 --> 21:22.157
But you've gotta believe in yourself.

21:23.283 --> 21:24.952
<i>Wm.</i>

21:26.954 --> 21:28.622
Win.

21:31.041 --> 21:33.418
Win.

21:37.589 --> 21:40.050
Come on, Vic.

21:42.761 --> 21:44.012
Come on, Vic!

21:49.434 --> 21:51.061
Come on, Vic!

22:03.448 --> 22:06.702
- Come on, Vic!
- Come on, Vic!

22:08.578 --> 22:10.956
Come on, Vic! Keep it going!

22:14.751 --> 22:19.630
Nice try, baby brother! I knew you had it
in you. Nice try, Thumper, but no cigar.

22:19.631 --> 22:23.009
Baby brother! Where's Stitch?

22:23.010 --> 22:24.885
Nice try, Frank.

22:24.886 --> 22:28.264
Nice try, Stitch.
Where's the monkey?

22:28.265 --> 22:32.935
Yeah. You know, I don't like animals
anyway. They're... filthy.

22:32.936 --> 22:35.354
- Yeah.
- Why don't you get it from the Rat?

22:35.355 --> 22:37.857
No hard feelings?

22:37.858 --> 22:39.693
None.

22:43.572 --> 22:47.825
- OK, Rat. Hand over the monkey.
- Hey, it's my monkey.

22:47.826 --> 22:50.286
- It's my monkey.
- No, it's my monkey.

22:50.287 --> 22:53.873
- It's my monkey.
- It's my monkey, greaseball.

22:53.874 --> 22:59.046
It may look like you, but it don't belong to
you. Now you're getting me hot, rat face.

23:02.466 --> 23:05.634
- Be reasonable, Rat.
- I'm gonna cut your throat.

23:05.635 --> 23:09.430
- Don't do this. I got a future.
- I owe you one.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.975
- Victor!
- I'm gonna cut your...

23:12.684 --> 23:14.352
No!

23:14.353 --> 23:17.981
- A flying rat.
- Skinny!

23:18.690 --> 23:21.818
Put him down, Victor.

23:22.527 --> 23:24.196
Put him down.

23:29.701 --> 23:34.538
Vic, that was great! You should've made
a wish with his legs, you rat!

23:34.539 --> 23:37.041
Come on, let's celebrate.
Come on, Lenny.

23:37.042 --> 23:39.668
OK, beer here, Mr Mahon.
Beer here.

23:39.669 --> 23:42.671
Hi. I'm your new brother.

23:42.672 --> 23:45.383
- I didn't wanna hurt him.
- Those guys wanna be hurt.

23:45.384 --> 23:49.513
- I'm gonna get some ice cream.
- Go get a double clip of ice cream.

23:51.264 --> 23:54.266
You know,
sometimes I wonder about nature.

23:54.267 --> 23:56.519
Me, myself,
I'm a rough and nervy guy.

23:56.520 --> 24:02.400
But my brother there, who should be a real
rough pecker, is as nasty as a daisy!

24:02.401 --> 24:07.696
Don't you guys ever wonder about nature?
Nature's a funny, funny thing!

24:07.697 --> 24:10.700
Hey...
anybody wanna buy a monkey?

24:13.120 --> 24:17.666
Coochie-coochie coo.
You're gonna be worth a fortune.

24:33.974 --> 24:35.766
Hey.

24:35.767 --> 24:39.145
We got business to talk with you.

24:39.146 --> 24:41.481
You cheated my boy Franky here.

24:43.400 --> 24:47.153
- What are you laughing at?
- Franky's making faces at me.

24:47.154 --> 24:49.405
- Let me dent his head.
- No.

24:49.406 --> 24:53.243
Your hands is too valuable
to waste on this greaseball.

24:55.454 --> 24:57.873
Well. Good night.

24:58.874 --> 25:01.293
Where are you going? Hey!

25:03.128 --> 25:06.046
Hey, I'm feeling nice tonight, ice jerk!

25:06.047 --> 25:09.759
But someday we're gonna have
business together, you and me.

25:11.052 --> 25:14.472
That guy's too stupid to be scared.

25:14.473 --> 25:16.516
He's a primitive.

25:23.273 --> 25:27.234
- Hi, Viccy.
- I'm not feeling good tonight, Susan.

25:27.235 --> 25:30.572
- Why the long face?
- I don't know my face is long.

25:31.781 --> 25:35.409
- Here's your shirts.
- Thanks. I could use some clean shirts.

25:35.410 --> 25:38.621
- What's the matter with Viccy tonight?
- Confusion.

25:38.622 --> 25:41.833
- And what is confusion?
- A noun.

25:42.501 --> 25:47.171
- What's the matter?
- Sometimes, this place... I don't like much.

25:47.172 --> 25:49.840
It doesn't matter.
We'll be out of here soon.

25:49.841 --> 25:52.635
I keep thinking about
that houseboat in Jersey.

25:52.636 --> 25:57.181
- When will we have enough money?
- A few years. Eight years.

25:57.182 --> 26:01.685
- Great. I'll have time to pack.
- Yeah, you'll have time to pack.

26:01.686 --> 26:06.149
- Tell me something nice, Viccy.
- You mean, say it now?

26:06.816 --> 26:08.860
OK, you don't have to.

26:12.322 --> 26:15.115
I love you, Susan.
And you know it.

26:15.116 --> 26:17.826
Susanna!

26:17.827 --> 26:21.456
- I have to go now.
- Already? I just got here.

26:22.249 --> 26:24.667
See you tomorrow.

26:24.668 --> 26:27.420
Good night, Ms Chow.

26:33.843 --> 26:36.887
Every night like clockwork?

26:36.888 --> 26:40.891
Look, I know your clogs are tired,
but you just hang on to Cosmo's neck.

26:40.892 --> 26:44.019
Nice neck?
I just had it washed last week.

26:44.020 --> 26:47.523
You're supposed to laugh.
No? Forget it.

26:47.524 --> 26:50.859
Just hang on and I'll drag you around
for the rest of the night.

26:50.860 --> 26:55.991
- Thanks, but Sticky might not like it.
- What do I care what that rat likes?

27:46.625 --> 27:49.084
So, listen, we get a ten,
no, 20-piece band

27:49.085 --> 27:53.505
and I set you up in the best clubs
in Manhattan - or Brooklyn, if you want.

27:53.506 --> 27:56.884
Forget Brooklyn. I ain't having you
dancing in no shipyards!

27:56.885 --> 28:00.429
- Stop, Cosmo. I'm too tired to laugh.
- You're too tired to laugh?

28:00.430 --> 28:04.892
Why don't you lay down and I'll wake you
in the morning? We'll finish talking.

28:04.893 --> 28:09.104
- When are you gonna cut your hair?
- Long hair proves your brains work.

28:09.105 --> 28:12.066
- And yours never stops.
- It's my fortune.

28:12.067 --> 28:15.152
We get a band, work up an act,
I dress you in red beads.

28:15.153 --> 28:17.821
I'll handle the paperwork.
We'll smash records.

28:17.822 --> 28:22.785
Annie O'Sherlock and her hot dancing
yam legs. Together, we can't miss.

28:22.786 --> 28:25.037
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.

28:25.038 --> 28:29.541
It's nice with the riffraff pigs off the
street, isn't it? All the slobs gone to bed.

28:29.542 --> 28:33.379
It's nice.
Well, think about working up an act, OK?

28:33.380 --> 28:36.757
- <i>I'll</i> think.
- "you'll think"?

28:36.758 --> 28:39.885
You oughta see a doctor
cos your eyes need glasses.

28:39.886 --> 28:42.304
- Why?
- Why? Why?

28:42.305 --> 28:46.518
- Yeah.
- You keep missing my mouth all the time!

28:48.144 --> 28:50.522
- Good night, Cosmo.
- Yeah.

29:25.932 --> 29:28.560
Come on, eat.

29:41.990 --> 29:44.033
Come on. Come on.

29:45.452 --> 29:47.162
What's wrong, Bella?

30:34.501 --> 30:36.628
Come on, Bella. Eat, really.

31:03.488 --> 31:05.323
- Hey!
- What?

31:06.533 --> 31:10.410
You gotta start off every morning
by crooning to that licebag bird?

31:10.411 --> 31:13.664
Well, she likes music
in the morning.

31:13.665 --> 31:16.251
Yeah? Then buy the bum a radio!

31:54.956 --> 31:57.916
Look at the dancing monkey.
Dance. Look at him dance.

31:57.917 --> 32:00.545
Dancing monkey.

32:46.799 --> 32:50.427
I'm out here freezing,
you're out here freezing.

32:50.428 --> 32:52.472
Everybody's freezing.

32:56.768 --> 32:58.310
I had plans for you.

32:58.311 --> 33:02.189
You were gonna be a dancing monkey,
the gimmick of a lifetime. But no.

33:02.190 --> 33:05.317
You're wasting my life,
you're wasting your life.

33:05.318 --> 33:08.488
How long do you think
I'm gonna stand for this?

33:24.420 --> 33:28.757
How are you doing, Bunch?
You look nice. I'm glad you passed by.

33:28.758 --> 33:33.303
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm shopping. What are you doing?

33:33.304 --> 33:38.058
I just quit that good job down on Wall
Street cos I ain't the type for cushy jobs.

33:38.059 --> 33:41.728
- Yeah. Who needs Wall Street?
- Yeah, who needs it?

33:41.729 --> 33:45.482
- So you're teaching monkeys to dance?
- Yeah, just to pass the time.

33:45.483 --> 33:48.860
I like animals. Coochie-coochie.

33:48.861 --> 33:52.280
- Listen, you coming by tonight?
- Yeah, tonight for sure.

33:52.281 --> 33:55.450
- You don't have to.
- Hey, Bunch. Don't I always show?

33:55.451 --> 33:57.703
Are you fishing for a compliment?

33:57.704 --> 34:01.498
- Yeah.
- All right, I'll mail it to you.

34:01.499 --> 34:04.627
OK. I'll see you, Cosmo.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.046
<i>Touche-co.</i>

34:09.465 --> 34:14.177
Now you did it. Now you embarrassed me.
You got nothing going, creep.

34:14.178 --> 34:17.431
How much ice tonight,
Mr Gaimbelli?

34:17.431 --> 34:20.101
No ice tonight. No ice.

34:22.311 --> 34:25.440
- I <i>did not!</i>
<i>- Yes, you did!</i>

34:32.697 --> 34:35.322
- Hey, Cosmo.
- Hey. What's buzzing, Victor?

34:35.324 --> 34:38.076
- Where's Lenny?
- Wrapping his teeth around dinner.

34:38.077 --> 34:41.873
- Where did you get the new suit?
- I won it in a raffle.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.504
- Raffle, nothing.
- Come on, Vic.

34:49.505 --> 34:55.135
Why should I look like a boiled rag when I
could have a stylish set of duds for free?

34:55.136 --> 34:57.679
- You're swiping from the deceased.
- Look, Vic.

34:57.680 --> 35:01.433
This guy come into the world nude,
so it's natural he go out that way.

35:01.434 --> 35:03.978
- That ain't right.
- When you're gone, you're gone.

35:04.145 --> 35:07.856
Why wear a suit? Is this guy
going dancing? Are you going dancing?

35:07.857 --> 35:11.651
No, he ain't, but I am, and I can't afford
to look like no slob tonight.

35:11.652 --> 35:16.115
Tell you what, I'll return it in the
morning when I'm done. I give you my word.

35:33.800 --> 35:36.218
What a rotten band.
Do they stink.

35:36.219 --> 35:40.013
I don't like that singer either.
He keeps winking at me all the time.

35:40.014 --> 35:42.599
- Where did you get the suit?
- You like it?

35:42.600 --> 35:47.437
Don't take it wrong,
but it looks like somebody died in it.

35:47.438 --> 35:50.024
Close, close.

36:25.643 --> 36:27.686
- Give me a dime!
- I ain't got one.

36:27.687 --> 36:30.355
- Give me a nickel!
- I ain't got a nickel.

36:30.356 --> 36:32.649
Get out of here!

36:32.650 --> 36:34.694
Freak! Get the point!

36:38.865 --> 36:43.201
I keep getting the freeze from this tomato.
I'm not a bad guy, am I right?

36:43.202 --> 36:48.249
No, I don't think so. But I can't
get nowhere. I can't get nowhere.

36:48.958 --> 36:54.129
- What do you want me to say, Cosmo?
- How about words that change my life?

36:54.130 --> 36:57.048
- I'm here.
- What's that mean?

36:57.049 --> 36:59.885
When you're ready
to forget that kid, I'm here.

36:59.886 --> 37:01.511
Not now, Bunch.

37:01.512 --> 37:04.097
Why not?
You've been seeing me for three years.

37:04.098 --> 37:07.309
It's been good,
but this is something more involved.

37:07.310 --> 37:11.438
- I don't think it'll work between you two.
- You don't think so?

37:11.439 --> 37:13.732
Why don't you say
why you don't think so?

37:13.733 --> 37:16.234
I just don't think
any people understand you.

37:16.235 --> 37:19.487
- But you do?
- Yeah. I've seen you more different ways.

37:19.488 --> 37:21.741
Don't get dirty, Bunch.

37:22.617 --> 37:24.784
You know what I mean.

37:24.785 --> 37:28.538
I ain't gonna hurt your feelings,
but I wanna let you in on something.

37:28.539 --> 37:31.083
You are a professional bed warmer.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.464
What I need is big money.

37:39.842 --> 37:42.469
- What are we doing here?
- Live a little, will ya?

37:42.470 --> 37:45.639
Paradise Alley's great.
Dames crawl out of the woodwork.

37:45.640 --> 37:49.851
- This is private, Cosmo.
- That's no problem, Lenno.

37:49.852 --> 37:52.146
Come on, live a little.

37:55.858 --> 38:00.320
You're gonna be so happy I took you here.
You're gonna laugh, maybe dance.

38:00.321 --> 38:04.533
Hey, Lenny, you can use one leg,
maybe do the Lindy Hop.

38:09.997 --> 38:11.999
Get a load of this.

38:14.085 --> 38:16.128
We're friends of Mario.

38:17.505 --> 38:21.676
- Who's Mario?
- I don't know. Everyone knows a Mario.

38:22.760 --> 38:26.805
- I'll see you tonight.
- Come on, will ya live a little bit?

38:26.806 --> 38:28.849
Thank you.

38:47.451 --> 38:49.662
You won't find God in this joint!

38:50.746 --> 38:52.581
Come on, come on.

38:54.083 --> 38:56.210
<i>Big Glory!</i>

39:00.548 --> 39:02.925
Two beers, bub.

39:12.727 --> 39:16.439
Somebody lose a nightmare?
Get a load of that kisser.

39:26.574 --> 39:29.784
Yes, here he is - Big Glory!

39:29.785 --> 39:32.246
All right, back off.

39:33.372 --> 39:37.417
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I remind you,

39:37.418 --> 39:39.836
a crisp $100 bill

39:39.837 --> 39:45.593
to any man who thinks
he can stand with Big Glory for one round!

39:47.428 --> 39:52.892
And now for your entertainment,
Sammy the dancing towel boy.

39:58.606 --> 40:02.400
A hundred bucks? If I was taller,
I'd square off with that fish myself.

40:02.401 --> 40:07.697
- Where are all these lovely ladies?
- I guess they're in the bathroom.

40:07.698 --> 40:11.160
Looks like
all the good-looking broads blew town.

40:12.536 --> 40:15.914
What do you think about
Vic scuffling with that truck?

40:15.915 --> 40:18.166
- It's a bad idea.
- Why bad?

40:18.167 --> 40:20.251
- You need an explanation?
- Yeah.

40:20.252 --> 40:23.755
That man's a professional.
He makes his living breaking bones.

40:23.756 --> 40:25.924
- You wanna turn that on Victor?
- Yeah.

40:25.925 --> 40:27.258
Don't be foolish.

40:27.259 --> 40:31.930
Vic can haul over a thousand pounds
of ice without blowing his breakfast.

40:31.931 --> 40:35.309
- Can he do that?
- Who are you talking to, Cosmo?

40:36.685 --> 40:39.855
Well, I sure ain't talking
to no high roller.

40:48.864 --> 40:52.826
- "Rustic".
- Adjective. The country.

40:52.827 --> 40:56.037
R-u-s-t-i-c.

40:56.038 --> 40:59.040
<i>Good. OK.</i>

40:59.041 --> 41:00.917
"Rutabaga“."

41:00.918 --> 41:04.003
Noun. Turnip.

41:04.004 --> 41:06.923
R-u-t-a-b...

41:06.924 --> 41:09.175
Hey, Vic! Lenny's in trouble!

41:09.176 --> 41:11.594
- What's the matter?
- We'll talk later.

41:11.595 --> 41:15.099
- Take care of Bella.
- Yeah, take care of that bird.

41:20.938 --> 41:22.356
Lenny?

41:24.483 --> 41:28.987
- I thought you said Lenny was in trouble.
- I knew you'd do this.

41:28.988 --> 41:33.366
I ain't in no trouble, Victor. Your brother
made a mistake. Why don't you go home?

41:33.367 --> 41:37.537
There's a hundred bucks to be had
and all you gotta do is stay in the ring.

41:37.538 --> 41:40.498
- He's not a wrestler.
- Got a crystal ball in your pocket?

41:40.499 --> 41:43.209
Hey, Vic.
It's easy money, duck soup.

41:43.210 --> 41:46.254
- Then you do it.
- Me?

41:46.255 --> 41:51.426
I might kill the guy. Nah, really. He's just a
couple of inches too tall for me, that's all.

41:51.427 --> 41:54.721
- What if I get a chipped tooth?
- I'll cover it with a blanket.

41:54.722 --> 41:56.765
Vic, you better go now.

42:00.352 --> 42:04.189
Always squawking about buying
some houseboat in Jersey, ain't ya?

42:04.190 --> 42:08.026
You're a dreamer, Vic. You ain't
never leaving unless you wise up.

42:08.027 --> 42:11.988
A hundred clams
for a couple of minutes' work.

42:11.989 --> 42:14.033
You think about it.

42:16.202 --> 42:19.455
- Should I do it?
- It's your body.

42:21.499 --> 42:24.418
Bring your body this way.

42:27.546 --> 42:32.885
Well clone, Sammy. Let's hear it
for Sammy the dancing towel boy!

42:35.137 --> 42:40.934
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight we have another idiot challenger

42:40.935 --> 42:47.024
who thinks he can stay in with
our very own club champion, Big Glory!

42:51.570 --> 42:53.446
What's your name, kid?

42:53.447 --> 42:54.989
- Victor.
- Kid Salami.

42:54.990 --> 42:58.869
If he's Kid Salami, what are you?
Kid Garlic?

43:00.037 --> 43:03.665
In this corner, believe it or not,

43:03.666 --> 43:05.542
Kid Salami!

43:05.543 --> 43:08.253
Yeah! Victor!

43:08.254 --> 43:10.547
And in the far corner,

43:10.548 --> 43:15.843
our very own smashing,
bashing, crashing.

43:15.844 --> 43:17.888
Big Glory!

43:19.890 --> 43:22.684
Cut the gabbing, stupid,
and start the brawl!

43:22.685 --> 43:25.979
- Die, you bum, die!
- Your mother was a...!

43:25.980 --> 43:28.815
Leave mothers out of it.
Die, you greaseball creep!

43:28.816 --> 43:32.527
- Hey, Kid Greaseball!
- Hey, Rat! His name is Kid Salami.

43:32.528 --> 43:34.821
Say after me, "Kid Salami."

43:34.822 --> 43:36.490
Moron!

43:45.124 --> 43:48.460
Hey, Vic.
Just pretend they're friendly.

43:50.212 --> 43:53.716
<i>Hit it, Sam!</i>

44:15.404 --> 44:17.697
There ain't no law
against fighting back!

44:17.698 --> 44:20.325
How bad are you hurt?
We're going home.

44:20.326 --> 44:23.202
- Come on, he looks great!
- What do you want to do?

44:23.203 --> 44:26.289
- If I get annoyed, I think I can win.
- Then get annoyed!

44:26.290 --> 44:31.127
Yeah, will you please get very annoyed?
You're embarrassing me. Here we go.

44:31.128 --> 44:33.713
<i>Come on, Victor!</i>

44:33.714 --> 44:35.840
Victor! Yeah!

44:35.841 --> 44:40.721
This guy is easy. Go ahead.
Go get him, gorilla. Go ahead.

44:41.180 --> 44:44.600
Go get him, Vic! Come on, Vic!

44:46.852 --> 44:50.230
Get him, Vic!
Don't embarrass me!

45:02.951 --> 45:04.202
Get into it!

45:04.203 --> 45:06.246
Get into it! Get annoyed!

45:27.017 --> 45:30.353
Kid Salami! Yeah!

45:30.354 --> 45:34.065
- Come on, Salami!
- This is my job. Get off, get off.

45:34.066 --> 45:37.276
The winner... Kid Salami!

45:37.277 --> 45:41.239
- Didn't I tell you?
- This kid ain't right. You wanna sell him?

45:41.240 --> 45:43.574
You owe a hundred, Burp.

45:43.575 --> 45:46.369
- The wrestler?
- Our brother's not for sale.

45:46.370 --> 45:49.498
- That's right.
- Let's go home, Vic.

45:52.543 --> 45:55.754
I knew you'd win!
Didn't I tell you? Of course you'd win.

45:56.922 --> 45:59.173
What happened?

45:59.174 --> 46:01.467
I won it.

46:01.468 --> 46:05.847
Can you believe our brother
just dumped the Paradise Alley champ?

46:05.848 --> 46:08.391
- It's a start, Lenny.
- He could've got hurt.

46:08.392 --> 46:12.478
I tell him to find a gimmick and he has.
His muscles are a God-given gimmick.

46:12.479 --> 46:14.731
- Fine, just don't do it.
- Hey, listen.

46:14.732 --> 46:18.109
Hey. What have you got
against making an honest buck?

46:18.110 --> 46:21.195
Nothing.
It just depends how it's made.

46:21.196 --> 46:25.950
Franky the Thumper's a wrestler. Stitch is
his manager. Why can't we do the same?

46:25.951 --> 46:32.123
Franky's rotten all his life. And don't try
turning Victor into one of your gimmicks.

46:32.124 --> 46:34.292
- You amaze me.
- You amaze me.

46:34.293 --> 46:38.045
- It's a ticket out. Where's your guts?
- I got more heart than guts.

46:38.046 --> 46:40.840
Don't hand me that.
You used to be the hardest.

46:40.841 --> 46:43.968
You blew it for yourself.
You ain't gonna blow it for me.

46:43.969 --> 46:47.138
- You watch yourself!
- Come on. Come on, hit me!

46:47.139 --> 46:52.059
You ain't even gonna make a dent! You're
the biggest joke in the neighbourhood.

46:52.060 --> 46:54.604
You were going places,
then you got brave.

46:54.605 --> 46:59.525
What have you got to show for proving
you was brave? What have you got?

46:59.526 --> 47:03.362
What have you got? A footlocker?
A Purple Heart and a walking cane?

47:03.363 --> 47:06.574
Put it all together
and what have you got? Nothing!

47:06.575 --> 47:11.996
You should've grew your hair and jumped off
a chair to get flatfeet like me, but no!

47:11.997 --> 47:15.583
You wanted to take a shot
at being a hero! Was it worth it?

47:15.584 --> 47:19.504
You better go home, Lenny!
Go home cos you're looking old tonight!

47:19.505 --> 47:23.132
And you better take a look at me
cos I'm on my way uptown!

47:23.133 --> 47:26.053
It's uptown for Cosmo!

48:10.556 --> 48:14.392
Stay there.
What are you coming around for?

48:14.393 --> 48:16.936
Cos I want to.

48:16.937 --> 48:21.357
- Just leave me be.
- Let's talk, Annie. Let's talk?

48:21.358 --> 48:25.444
After three years, you wanna talk.
Now I don't think I can listen.

48:25.445 --> 48:27.196
- Please, let's talk.
- No!

48:27.197 --> 48:30.783
- I wanna say I'm sorry.
- You don't make it better by saying that.

48:30.784 --> 48:34.120
You put me through too much.
Forget the sorrys, all right?

48:34.121 --> 48:37.832
- I've had problems.
- Don't talk in front of these people!

48:37.833 --> 48:40.167
I don't care!
Do you see how I move?

48:40.168 --> 48:43.129
- Did you think it changes anything?
- I'm not the same!

48:43.130 --> 48:47.550
I said, did you think that would change
anything, that I'd feel sorry for you?

48:47.551 --> 48:50.970
Why have you been avoiding me
for over a year? No phone, nothing.

48:50.971 --> 48:55.224
Cos you didn't want anybody feeling sorry
for you. I don't feel sorry for you!

48:55.225 --> 49:00.814
I feel sorry for me! You did what
you wanted. I'm the one that got left out!

49:02.941 --> 49:04.818
I'm back.

49:05.903 --> 49:08.863
- Do you want me back?
- No.

49:08.864 --> 49:13.118
- We gotta start over, Annie.
- No more, Lenny.

49:34.014 --> 49:35.014
Mumbles!

49:35.849 --> 49:36.974
What do you want?

49:36.975 --> 49:39.603
When was the last time
you were with a woman?

49:40.312 --> 49:43.607
- Probably the Depression.
- What are you saving it for?

49:44.358 --> 49:47.526
I don't know, man.
Maybe... maybe a big finish.

49:47.527 --> 49:51.238
You better get out more often
cos you're starting to turn Grey.

49:51.239 --> 49:55.953
Me, I'm on my way to visit the
best-looking tomato in the neighbourhood.

49:57.245 --> 49:59.373
- Good night, Mumbles.
- Good night.

50:14.930 --> 50:18.099
I wasn't doing it to you.
I'm doing it to myself.

50:18.100 --> 50:22.228
- You did it to both of us, Lenny.
- We've always been above this nonsense.

50:22.229 --> 50:24.356
Let's get above it?

50:25.649 --> 50:30.569
Come on, baby. You got too much on the
ball to be jostling here in the street.

50:30.570 --> 50:32.614
It's too late, Lenny.

50:38.537 --> 50:43.916
- Don't do this to us.
- I don't wanna be forgotten again.

50:43.917 --> 50:47.211
And how many times
do I have to say that you won't?

50:47.212 --> 50:50.047
I was wrong for what I did for us.

50:50.048 --> 50:52.258
I can't, Lenny. I can't.

50:52.259 --> 50:56.304
- Why?
- If I do, it starts all over again.

50:58.015 --> 51:03.103
That's exactly what I wanna do.
I wanna start all over again.

51:04.563 --> 51:08.150
For Christ's sakes,
don't make me beg?

53:36.756 --> 53:38.632
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

53:38.633 --> 53:40.593
- What happened?
- About what?

53:40.594 --> 53:43.137
- What happened?
- What do you mean?

53:43.138 --> 53:46.223
- I thought we had something going.
- We did.

53:46.224 --> 53:47.933
- What?
- We were friends.

53:47.934 --> 53:51.312
- There was more.
- Cosmo, we were friends.

53:51.313 --> 53:55.024
- You just used me to stay close to Lenny.
- Why are you saying that?

53:55.025 --> 53:59.320
We got no papers on each other. I'm back
with Lenny cos that's where I wanna be.

53:59.321 --> 54:02.031
He dumped ya, I was nice to ya.
Don't that matter?

54:02.032 --> 54:06.785
- Sure it matters.
- Answer me one thing. Do you love him?

54:06.786 --> 54:08.120
- Yes.
- No, you don't.

54:08.121 --> 54:10.998
Nobody loves nobody round here.
Everybody fakes it.

54:10.999 --> 54:14.335
- Why don't you leave the lady alone?
- Shut your fat mouth!

54:14.336 --> 54:16.754
- I'm calling the cops!
- I'll break your face!

54:16.755 --> 54:19.048
- Look, do you wanna come in?
- For what?

54:19.049 --> 54:22.551
Small talk and coffee? Tea and crumpets?
For what? Friends?

54:22.552 --> 54:24.428
Good friends.

54:24.429 --> 54:27.014
You two should never have been
leading me on.

54:27.015 --> 54:30.392
I never led you on.
I never wanted to lead you on, Cosmo.

54:30.393 --> 54:33.729
- Come in. All the heat's getting out.
- Then close the window.

54:33.730 --> 54:36.565
- You want me to close the window?
- Close the window.

54:36.566 --> 54:38.902
I'm gonna close the window!

54:41.238 --> 54:45.324
You wanna close the window? I don't
like you neither. I don't like nobody.

54:45.325 --> 54:49.246
I'm in demand. I don't need you.
I don't need nobody!

54:51.122 --> 54:53.124
I'm sensitive.

55:05.553 --> 55:08.722
- They should've never led me on.
- Why do this?

55:08.723 --> 55:12.893
- They should never have done that.
- What do you expect? It's his old girl.

55:12.894 --> 55:15.688
- He dumped her!
- She wasn't your type.

55:15.689 --> 55:19.817
Don't tell me my type. What does anybody
know? Who do you think is my type?

55:19.818 --> 55:22.736
- Why not look over here?
- You think that's good?

55:22.737 --> 55:26.615
Do you think we're a match
made in heaven or something?

55:26.616 --> 55:29.119
- You cold, Cosmo?
- I ain't cold.

55:30.203 --> 55:33.706
I hope I croak here.
I hope I catch pneumonia, is what I hope.

55:33.707 --> 55:36.792
I hope they come up here
and find me dead someday.

55:36.793 --> 55:40.045
Come on, this it getting stupid.

55:40.046 --> 55:44.550
We've been here all morning. You've been
shouting everything. Nothing's changed.

55:44.551 --> 55:46.594
They're still together.

55:48.221 --> 55:52.349
We're still together.
So nothing's changed.

55:52.350 --> 55:55.811
- You don't understand.
- I understand your feelings got hurt.

55:55.812 --> 55:58.647
- Nobody understands nothing.
- You believe that?

55:58.648 --> 56:02.693
Yeah, we fake it. Everybody in the whole
stinking world fakes everything.

56:02.694 --> 56:06.280
- Come on, Cosmo. You're gonna get cold.
- Good. I hope I croak.

56:06.281 --> 56:11.327
The problem is, it's just that nothing
in my life is working right any more.

56:11.328 --> 56:16.999
- What am I? A broken part?
- No, you're not. You don't understand.

56:17.000 --> 56:20.753
I understand from us.
That's all I know from.

56:20.754 --> 56:23.172
Is that a fact?

56:23.173 --> 56:25.924
That's a fact.

56:25.925 --> 56:29.762
- You don't understand.
- I understand.

56:29.763 --> 56:32.057
You don't care about money?

56:33.224 --> 56:35.726
Us.

56:35.727 --> 56:38.145
You don't care about cars?

56:38.146 --> 56:41.023
Are you hard of hearing?

56:41.024 --> 56:42.692
Us.

56:43.777 --> 56:47.696
- So what's that supposed to mean?
- It means I'm stuck with you.

56:47.697 --> 56:50.324
Stuck with me?

56:50.325 --> 56:53.702
Yeah, I guess we're stuck together.

56:53.703 --> 56:55.747
"Stuck together"?

56:58.166 --> 57:00.794
Pretty sticky relationship?

57:08.718 --> 57:10.762
I love you, Cosmo.

57:12.347 --> 57:14.474
I love you, Cosmo.

57:30.490 --> 57:33.826
Vic, last night was
the beginning of something big.

57:33.827 --> 57:35.661
- How big?
- I'll level with you.

57:35.662 --> 57:39.164
You stepped in them ropes
an ice-ball jerk, and came out a champ.

57:39.165 --> 57:43.502
- I don't feel like no champ.
- Don't worry, just make me a handler.

57:43.503 --> 57:45.546
I can't do it. I promised Susan.

57:45.547 --> 57:48.924
Don't promise her nothing.
Her relatives bombed Pearl Harbor.

57:48.925 --> 57:53.387
- Watch your mouth. She's Chinese.
- What's the cliff? I'm getting a headache.

57:53.388 --> 57:57.433
- She got annoyed when she found out.
- Suey don't know nothing.

57:57.434 --> 57:59.017
- Susan.
- All right - Susan.

57:59.018 --> 58:02.104
Will you stop kicking that can?
Now look.

58:02.105 --> 58:05.482
Look, you and Suey...
Susan, I'm sorry.

58:05.483 --> 58:09.361
You and Susan got plans
about getting out and buying a houseboat.

58:09.362 --> 58:11.822
- Where do you want that houseboat?
- Jersey.

58:11.823 --> 58:15.742
Wrestling can be your passport
out of this city. It's a growing sport.

58:15.743 --> 58:18.537
- How soon?
- What do you want, the exact date?

58:18.538 --> 58:21.915
- I promised Susan.
- I wanna let you in on something.

58:21.916 --> 58:26.462
Suey's almost a regular girl. Regular girls
don't know nothing about wrestling.

58:26.463 --> 58:29.047
Know how many guys
coulda sat on top of the world,

58:29.048 --> 58:33.010
but they let a dame tell them what to do
and only ended up sitting on a toilet?

58:33.011 --> 58:36.930
You're causing me to breathe heavy.
You got no reason to treat me crummy.

58:36.931 --> 58:39.183
- I'm not treating you crummy.
- You are!

58:39.184 --> 58:41.435
I ain't treating you crummy.

58:41.436 --> 58:45.272
How long have you been an Iceman?
I wanna hear you say that. How long?

58:45.273 --> 58:47.983
- Since I was 12.
- Since you were 12. Great.

58:47.984 --> 58:53.655
I'm gonna let you in on a fact of life,
genius. There ain't no bones in ice cream.

58:53.656 --> 58:58.160
Don't be wasting your time looking
for something that ain't there, Vic.

58:58.161 --> 59:01.955
Victor, this beef
is a God-given gimmick.

59:01.956 --> 59:06.335
What do you say?
Are we partners? Shake. Put it there.

59:06.336 --> 59:10.173
- There ain't no bones in tuna.
- So, what's that mean?

59:10.715 --> 59:13.342
<i>I don't know.</i>

59:13.343 --> 59:16.470
- What are you doing with the can?
- I'll kick it on the way home.

59:16.471 --> 59:19.098
- Gonna kick it on the way home?
- Yeah.

59:21.476 --> 59:25.312
Wait a minute, Victor!
Hey, Vic! Wait a minute. Wait.

59:25.313 --> 59:28.815
You get the truck and I'll show you
what real dough you can make.

59:28.816 --> 59:30.817
<i>OK.</i>

59:30.818 --> 59:33.363
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

59:41.913 --> 59:47.543
Now you'll see what real dough
you can make. Hey! Is Big Glory in?

59:47.544 --> 59:52.839
- You the guy that beat Glory?
- He's a relative. Where's Glory?

59:52.840 --> 59:56.177
- Downstairs, door on the left.
- Bless you.

01:00:17.574 --> 01:00:19.908
Yoo-hoo. Glory?

01:00:19.909 --> 01:00:22.202
- Glow?
- Who is it?

01:00:22.203 --> 01:00:25.872
- It's just a couple of fans.
- Can I talk with you?

01:00:25.873 --> 01:00:29.459
I don't like y'all to come down here.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:32.337
I'm sorry about what happened.
I was lucky.

01:00:32.338 --> 01:00:34.798
Now, what did
you wanna talk to me about?

01:00:34.799 --> 01:00:38.176
My brother here was wondering
how good it is to be a wrestler.

01:00:38.177 --> 01:00:42.222
Much like any other thing.
I mean, if you're good, it pays off.

01:00:42.223 --> 01:00:46.143
Sure it is. Glow here just didn't
waste no money on furniture, Vic.

01:00:46.144 --> 01:00:49.271
- Is this where you live?
- This place ain't permanent.

01:00:49.272 --> 01:00:53.775
My manager, he's saving my dough.
He's gonna start my career all over again.

01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:58.530
- How long's he been saving?
- Seven years. I ain't much for numbers.

01:00:58.531 --> 01:01:01.617
It's probably any day now, Glory.
Don't get impatient.

01:01:01.618 --> 01:01:04.077
We gotta go.
We got appointments elsewhere.

01:01:04.078 --> 01:01:05.454
Hey...

01:01:05.455 --> 01:01:10.375
- I's 41, but I'm still strong, you know?
- Yeah, you're still strong.

01:01:10.376 --> 01:01:14.254
I'm gonna twist my way up in the ranks
soon. I's got a family to watch for.

01:01:14.255 --> 01:01:16.298
- Where are they?
- You a detective?

01:01:16.299 --> 01:01:19.718
With all the dough Glow makes,
they're probably living grand.

01:01:19.719 --> 01:01:21.887
<i>'Way's on vacation. Hey, boy.</i>

01:01:21.888 --> 01:01:25.891
To get ahead, somebody to trust
you've gotta have to be your handler.

01:01:25.892 --> 01:01:29.645
- Now, you remember that.
- You remember that, Victor.

01:01:29.646 --> 01:01:33.357
We gotta be going, Mr Glory.
Thank you very much for your time.

01:01:33.358 --> 01:01:35.108
Hey.

01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:38.403
This is my place
and this is where I stay.

01:01:38.404 --> 01:01:41.448
And you come talk to me
any time you want, OK?

01:01:41.449 --> 01:01:43.493
<i>Okay-duke.</i>

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:56.546
Come on, let me be your handler.
I can't keep begging you like this.

01:01:56.547 --> 01:01:59.591
- You're making me look bad.
- Hey, what are you doing?

01:01:59.592 --> 01:02:02.469
I'm gonna choke ya
if you don't make me your handler!

01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:04.971
- Don't con me, Cosmo.
- I'm begging you!

01:02:04.972 --> 01:02:09.477
You want me to walk like this? I'm
trustworthy. Don't you want the good life?

01:02:10.853 --> 01:02:14.148
It doesn't make much sense
to me at all.

01:02:16.401 --> 01:02:21.029
- I just think you're making a mistake.
- Susan says so too, but I need money.

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:25.826
- You're working steady.
- I've saved for years and I only have $106.

01:02:25.827 --> 01:02:29.871
Victor, is moving to Jersey
worth getting hurt for?

01:02:29.872 --> 01:02:32.541
- I won't get hurt.
- Well, why chance it?

01:02:32.542 --> 01:02:36.253
Lenny, my beef is
a God-given gimmick and you know it is.

01:02:36.254 --> 01:02:41.676
You know what I think is funny?
I see you, but I hear Cosmo talking.

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:46.639
Now go on home and come back
when it's just Victor talking.

01:02:51.144 --> 01:02:55.480
- OK, it's just me this time.
- It's good to see you again, Victor.

01:02:55.481 --> 01:03:00.444
- I was thinking you'd be a good handler.
- I think you think too much.

01:03:00.445 --> 01:03:02.404
You like your job?

01:03:02.405 --> 01:03:04.615
Your job. You like it here?

01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:18.128
- Why do you ask that?
- I don't know. I told Cosmo I wanted you.

01:03:18.129 --> 01:03:22.967
He said you wouldn't do it because
you liked working with dead things.

01:03:24.051 --> 01:03:29.514
Do you get a kick out of making me
feel bad? You think I like this job?

01:03:29.515 --> 01:03:33.811
- I don't know. It's quiet.
- Yes. It's quiet.

01:03:34.687 --> 01:03:37.564
It's peaceful.

01:03:37.565 --> 01:03:40.942
My advice is to go home
and do some hard thinking for yourself.

01:03:40.943 --> 01:03:44.237
If you still wanna, come back.
We'll talk some other time.

01:03:44.238 --> 01:03:46.199
All right. See you later.

01:03:52.663 --> 01:03:56.541
- Sorry, Victor. I don't need ice any more.
- But I got your delivery.

01:03:56.542 --> 01:04:02.465
I bought an electric icebox and it works
very, very good. I'm really sorry, Victor.

01:05:36.601 --> 01:05:40.897
Come on! Heave them rocks!
Go on. Heave it!

01:05:42.732 --> 01:05:46.527
This is a good exercise
to beef up them shoulders.

01:05:47.612 --> 01:05:52.657
- Where did you learn to train people?
- You're born with it. Bend that pipe.

01:05:52.658 --> 01:05:56.202
That's right. Bend that pipe.
Let me see you bend it.

01:05:56.203 --> 01:05:59.539
Good boy! Throw it away.
Throw that pipe away.

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:03.168
Now get over there
and heave that dumper.

01:06:03.169 --> 01:06:06.254
- Victor.
- Yeah?

01:06:06.255 --> 01:06:09.424
- I'm on my way to set up your first match.
- Thanks, Lenny.

01:06:09.425 --> 01:06:11.469
You're welcome.

01:06:13.429 --> 01:06:15.722
- I'll see you later.
- Where are you going?

01:06:15.723 --> 01:06:17.891
- Tell Susan the news.
- Keep training.

01:06:17.892 --> 01:06:22.479
- My beef feels strong, right, Cosmo?
- Yeah, you got strong beef.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:26.650
Yeah. Hey, Lenny,
could you do Charlie Chaplin?

01:06:26.651 --> 01:06:29.110
<i>Sure.</i>

01:06:29.111 --> 01:06:31.364
All right, I'll see you later.

01:06:33.699 --> 01:06:36.451
- Down in the mouth, ain't ya?
- What's that mean?

01:06:36.452 --> 01:06:39.120
Taking the handling job serious,
ain't ya?

01:06:39.121 --> 01:06:43.833
- Let's get this straight. Victor came to me.
- Yeah, everything comes to you.

01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:47.504
Your job's keeping Victor in shape
and my job's handling business.

01:06:47.505 --> 01:06:50.465
I took the job
cos I plan on doing things with it.

01:06:50.466 --> 01:06:55.345
I can tell you're a guy with promise. What
if I say I don't like working with you?

01:06:55.346 --> 01:06:57.390
Join the navy.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.864
That's what I'm feeling inside
for you, Lenny!

01:07:14.865 --> 01:07:17.701
- Don't mix in it, Cosmo.
- Why did you do it?

01:07:17.702 --> 01:07:20.161
- Cos she was mine.
- You dumped her!

01:07:20.162 --> 01:07:22.330
Why do you do this to yourself?

01:07:22.331 --> 01:07:25.583
You two should have never
been leading me on. I'm sensitive.

01:07:25.584 --> 01:07:28.044
Nobody's leading you on.
It's in your head.

01:07:28.045 --> 01:07:33.133
I don't wanna hear it. I don't like what you
two done. I'm in this just for the money.

01:07:33.134 --> 01:07:36.137
Aren't you always?

01:07:40.433 --> 01:07:41.684
Yeah.

01:07:43.644 --> 01:07:47.648
So come on. Come here.
Out of the shadows. Let me look at you.

01:07:49.066 --> 01:07:52.610
War hero? What's your name?

01:07:52.611 --> 01:07:55.572
- Lenny.
- Well, listen to this, Captain Lenny.

01:07:55.573 --> 01:08:01.703
Before you wanna bet any cash on your
man, you gotta get a name, a big name.

01:08:01.704 --> 01:08:04.539
Ain't that right <i>Big</i> Glory?

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:06.708
Then you can bet some cash on him.

01:08:06.709 --> 01:08:11.463
Your guy's gotta have a good record
before these jerks will bet heavy on him.

01:08:11.464 --> 01:08:14.758
I'm not talking about
those five and tens, neither.

01:08:14.759 --> 01:08:19.429
I'm talking about that $100 you stole from
me, you creep. My man wasn't in shape.

01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:22.599
- You're saying that's all there is to it?
- That's all..

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:26.603
Come on. I promise you 50 wins
before Christmas. What do you say?

01:08:26.604 --> 01:08:30.106
50 wins?

01:08:30.107 --> 01:08:32.149
Listen, punk.

01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:37.363
Your man gets in the ring
40 or 50 times before Christmas,

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:40.701
he won't have enough brains
to tie his shoelaces.

01:08:42.078 --> 01:08:45.538
Then you'll have two cripples
in the family.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:50.710
Couldn't you find any other tape?

01:08:50.711 --> 01:08:54.881
- What's wrong with electrical tape?
- Vic's a fighter, not a broken toaster.

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:59.051
Don't play patty-cakes with this burn.
Get in quick and use the ice clamp.

01:08:59.053 --> 01:09:03.348
- What's the ice clamp?
- It's a little secret weapon that I created.

01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:07.144
OK, Vic. It's time to start your career.

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:42.179
Come on, Vic!
Ice clamp! Ice clamp!

01:10:03.742 --> 01:10:06.119
The winner, Kid Salami!

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:10.039
You know, I've been thinking. Since
everybody knows you as Kid Salami,

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.960
I want you to hang a few salamis
around your neck as kind of a trademark.

01:10:13.961 --> 01:10:16.880
It'll be great for when
you fight Death Breath.

01:10:16.881 --> 01:10:20.050
- Yeah? What kind of salamis, wise guy?
- Genoa.

01:11:08.766 --> 01:11:10.893
Come on! Ice clamp! Ice clamp!

01:11:26.367 --> 01:11:29.495
Salami! Salami! Salami!

01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:37.044
Salami! Salami! Salami!

01:11:41.048 --> 01:11:45.511
Salami! Salami! Salami! Salami!

01:11:59.692 --> 01:12:02.402
- Problems?
- Vic is getting hurt. We oughta quit.

01:12:02.403 --> 01:12:04.904
- And end an undefeated career?
- Who cares?

01:12:04.905 --> 01:12:07.156
300 from you. Come on. $300.

01:12:07.157 --> 01:12:10.286
- OK, squirt, let's go.
- Get out of here!

01:12:30.889 --> 01:12:36.102
- I know what time it is.
- I haven't seen you for over three clays.

01:12:36.103 --> 01:12:40.232
Look, I've just got a lot of work to do now
and I'll be by later.

01:12:42.651 --> 01:12:45.904
I'm selling Kid Salami. He's my brother.
Here's the action.

01:12:54.913 --> 01:13:01.670
Salami! Salami! Salami!

01:13:05.424 --> 01:13:08.176
You got him!

01:13:08.177 --> 01:13:12.555
Hey, forget about having mercy
with these bums?

01:13:12.556 --> 01:13:15.391
That's the only way
to treat these animals.

01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:18.519
Ape Wilson?
You call yourself a wrestler?

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.813
You didn't last five minutes,
you bum.

01:13:20.814 --> 01:13:23.941
Turn in your shoes.
You're a disgrace to my profession.

01:13:23.942 --> 01:13:27.737
Don't pin these bums that fast,
cos I don't get a chance to place my bets.

01:13:27.738 --> 01:13:29.655
- Sure.
- We oughta talk.

01:13:29.656 --> 01:13:33.368
Get dressed.
We're gonna celebrate tonight. What is it?

01:13:33.369 --> 01:13:36.204
What's with you having him fight
on Christmas Eve?

01:13:36.205 --> 01:13:39.665
Come on. I'm taking care
of business good. Now relax.

01:13:39.666 --> 01:13:43.127
He's winning, but he's
getting banged around. I don't like it.

01:13:43.128 --> 01:13:47.840
It's part of the business. If you don't
like blood, you're in the wrong racket.

01:13:47.841 --> 01:13:50.468
- Hey, I'm talking about our brother.
- Cosmo.

01:13:50.469 --> 01:13:53.805
- You understand?
- Don't.

01:13:53.806 --> 01:13:57.517
- Who is this guy I'm talking to here?
- Relax, OK?

01:13:57.518 --> 01:14:00.687
Come on.
You're looking old tonight.

01:14:12.699 --> 01:14:15.369
V as in Victor.

01:14:17.204 --> 01:14:19.997
Tonight you won your 40th fight.
What do you say?

01:14:19.998 --> 01:14:22.458
- I'm a little disoriented.
- "Disoriented"?

01:14:22.459 --> 01:14:26.546
You getting fancy with that dictionary.
You don't sound happy for a rich man.

01:14:26.547 --> 01:14:32.135
- I'm happy, but I don't think Cosmo is.
- I'll take care of Cosmo. You stay healthy.

01:14:32.136 --> 01:14:36.013
- I'm trying. How much money we got?
- What? You don't trust me?

01:14:36.014 --> 01:14:40.852
Sure. I just wanted to know
how much money we have.

01:14:40.853 --> 01:14:44.272
- Faith. You know what that word means?
- Yeah, I know.

01:14:44.273 --> 01:14:47.358
- Yeah? What?
- You gotta have it to stay in church.

01:14:47.359 --> 01:14:52.572
- Don't give me that.
- Faith is believing in something invisible.

01:14:52.573 --> 01:14:56.075
Don't mix in business, Victor.
I'm taking care of everything.

01:14:56.076 --> 01:14:58.494
- I'm doing what's best, understand?
- Yeah.

01:14:58.495 --> 01:15:01.290
- You've just gotta have faith.
- I have faith.

01:15:03.417 --> 01:15:05.001
- Hey, Lenny.
- What?

01:15:05.002 --> 01:15:07.503
Do Charlie Chaplin.

01:15:07.504 --> 01:15:09.548
Later.

01:15:10.799 --> 01:15:15.344
You get dressed. We're gonna celebrate.
I'm taking you to Lindy's for cheesecake.

01:15:15.345 --> 01:15:17.346
Yeah.

01:15:17.347 --> 01:15:20.225
<i>Come on.</i>

01:15:35.032 --> 01:15:38.075
You dance excellent, Sammy.
Merry Christmas.

01:15:38.076 --> 01:15:40.120
Merry Christmas, Salami.

01:15:47.711 --> 01:15:51.005
Stitch. This is beautiful.

01:15:51.006 --> 01:15:54.300
I got your name inscribed on the side.
Use them in good health.

01:15:54.301 --> 01:15:57.845
- I will, I will.
- Stitch, this is exactly what I wanted.

01:15:57.846 --> 01:16:00.473
- You must've read my mind.
- It's pretty.

01:16:00.474 --> 01:16:02.601
Shut up!

01:16:09.191 --> 01:16:11.360
Franky, Franky. Wanna dance?

01:16:16.782 --> 01:16:18.866
Robe fits, Stitch.

01:16:18.867 --> 01:16:22.912
Yeah, well, it oughta.
I had it made special for you.

01:16:22.913 --> 01:16:25.998
And the teeth look nice, too.

01:16:25.999 --> 01:16:28.543
Yeah, they look nice.

01:16:28.544 --> 01:16:30.587
They look real nice.

01:16:36.134 --> 01:16:39.011
Ain't you glad
I whipped Big Glory tonight?

01:16:39.012 --> 01:16:41.264
Yeah, sure I'm glad.

01:16:41.265 --> 01:16:43.350
Hey, Franky.

01:16:44.393 --> 01:16:48.647
Do I look any older to you
than I did last year on this date?

01:16:51.108 --> 01:16:53.609
Nah.

01:16:53.610 --> 01:16:55.654
The mirror's dirty.

01:16:56.947 --> 01:17:00.825
Yeah. And I gotta get the lights fixed
in this joint, too?

01:17:00.826 --> 01:17:02.118
Yeah.

01:17:02.119 --> 01:17:06.122
- Merry Christmas, Franky.
- Merry Christmas.

01:17:06.123 --> 01:17:11.295
Hey, Frank. Do I look any taller to you
than I did last year on this date?

01:17:15.215 --> 01:17:17.134
Nah.

01:17:28.979 --> 01:17:33.274
Get out of here, you creep! What are
you doing out here on Christmas?

01:17:33.275 --> 01:17:35.443
Get a job!

01:17:35.444 --> 01:17:37.903
Wino bum!

01:17:37.904 --> 01:17:41.158
Don't you know Santa Claus
when you see him?

01:17:44.036 --> 01:17:47.664
- You got any season's greetings for me?
- Of course.

01:17:50.292 --> 01:17:52.460
Is that for me?

01:17:52.461 --> 01:17:56.047
It might be... if you're a good girl.

01:17:56.048 --> 01:18:00.551
Lenny, I'm terribly sorry.
I forgot to get you anything.

01:18:00.552 --> 01:18:03.262
It's OK. I'll get a refund.

01:18:03.263 --> 01:18:05.557
Maybe I did get you something.

01:18:17.819 --> 01:18:22.991
- He's a handsome devil, isn't he?
- I don't know about the "handsome" part.

01:18:27.037 --> 01:18:30.332
Try the next one.
The next one's very hysterical.

01:18:34.252 --> 01:18:35.670
What is this?

01:18:35.671 --> 01:18:41.342
You take that, you hook it up to your bed
there, and it keeps track of your mileage.

01:18:41.343 --> 01:18:43.636
Cosmo,
sometimes you got no class.

01:18:43.637 --> 01:18:46.889
You don't like it? Try the next one.
The next one is all class.

01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:49.017
The next one is a class import.

01:18:49.726 --> 01:18:52.561
It's perfume!

01:18:52.562 --> 01:18:55.314
The best.

01:18:55.315 --> 01:19:00.069
- I'll smell with the best.
- You're gonna smell with the best.

01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:04.490
Gee, it's really nice. You planning on
taking me uptown or something?

01:19:04.491 --> 01:19:08.035
- Yeah, I was, yeah.
- What happened to your plans?

01:19:08.036 --> 01:19:11.122
I don't know.
I think I've gotta do something first.

01:19:11.123 --> 01:19:13.416
You mean with your brother?

01:19:13.417 --> 01:19:17.253
I was thinking, it's Christmas Eve.
I shouldn't leave you alone.

01:19:17.254 --> 01:19:22.758
I haven't even opened my presents yet.
Did you get me some socks?

01:19:22.759 --> 01:19:25.053
Yeah. Three pair.

01:19:28.473 --> 01:19:32.476
- Where are you going?
- Paradise Alley. You wanna go?

01:19:32.477 --> 01:19:36.272
Yeah, but you go alone.
I'll wait here.

01:19:36.273 --> 01:19:40.401
Hey, Bunch. You wait alone, OK?

01:19:40.402 --> 01:19:44.614
Cos tomorrow
you're out of this place... for good.

01:19:53.248 --> 01:19:54.916
Thanks.

01:19:56.585 --> 01:19:59.628
Honey, when you're in motion,
you just remain in motion.

01:19:59.629 --> 01:20:01.797
The name of the game
is momentum.

01:20:01.798 --> 01:20:07.304
I know you don't believe it, but things
are gonna work out this way. Please?

01:20:11.475 --> 01:20:13.726
Do they?

01:20:13.727 --> 01:20:18.023
What colour hair
does your business meeting have?

01:20:20.025 --> 01:20:23.486
- What are you saying? It's business.
- Business?

01:20:23.487 --> 01:20:26.322
I'm saying if you leave me tonight,
don't come back.

01:20:26.323 --> 01:20:29.450
I can't have you
always walking out on me, Lenny.

01:20:29.451 --> 01:20:33.163
OK. Maybe you're right.
Maybe it's not the same.

01:20:33.663 --> 01:20:38.209
- Maybe we had our time and it's over.
- Yeah, maybe.

01:20:38.210 --> 01:20:41.045
What am I supposed to have
done wrong, Lenny?

01:20:41.046 --> 01:20:46.258
You didn't do nothing wrong. I'm climbing
now and you don't like heights.

01:20:46.259 --> 01:20:49.011
Then it's over. Just like that.

01:20:49.012 --> 01:20:52.432
No. It's business.

01:21:25.131 --> 01:21:27.883
- Glory.
- Santa?

01:21:27.884 --> 01:21:30.928
Nah, it's me, Cosmo Carboni.

01:21:30.929 --> 01:21:35.474
- What do you say, Cosmo?
- I came by to see how you was doing.

01:21:35.475 --> 01:21:38.894
Well, you can take a look at me
and see I ain't doing too well.

01:21:38.895 --> 01:21:43.983
- Yeah, I can see that. What happened?
- I scrapped with Franky the Thumper.

01:21:43.984 --> 01:21:48.362
- Yeah. I know the beast-animal.
- Well, he's bad weather.

01:21:48.363 --> 01:21:52.700
I've been hearing a lot of good things
about your brother. He's coming up fast.

01:21:52.701 --> 01:21:56.954
- I know. He's coming up too fast.
- Good-looking boy he once was.

01:21:56.955 --> 01:21:59.915
Well, a bathing beauty
he ain't no more, is he?

01:21:59.916 --> 01:22:02.877
I bet he ain't.

01:22:02.878 --> 01:22:05.379
We both sure ain't
no bathing beauties?

01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:10.343
Hey, Glory. What say you and me go out
and we have some Christmas fun tonight?

01:22:13.555 --> 01:22:15.599
I'd like that.

01:22:20.687 --> 01:22:26.191
Bathing beauties... It's been a long time
since I had Christmas wine with a friend.

01:22:26.192 --> 01:22:31.239
Well, you ain't never had it till you've
had Christmas wine with Santa Carboni!

01:22:39.247 --> 01:22:42.666
Come on! Get it over! Hey!
Are you crazy?

01:22:42.667 --> 01:22:46.087
Don't you recognise
Cosmo Carboni and Big Glory?

01:22:48.131 --> 01:22:50.175
<i>Cosmo!</i>

01:23:05.106 --> 01:23:07.692
Glow just broke his company's property!

01:23:08.944 --> 01:23:11.279
Are you crazy?
Now get rid of this!

01:23:12.822 --> 01:23:13.865
Get out of here!

01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:17.953
- I'm a bear! 
- Don't you recognize Santa Claus?

01:23:30.632 --> 01:23:32.926
Look what kind of drunken bums they are.

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:36.220
Knock it off!

01:23:37.138 --> 01:23:39.516
What do you say, we go
to Stitch Mahon for a drink?

01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:42.727
You know they don't allow
coloured folks in there.

01:23:43.645 --> 01:23:46.606
Come on, I can get you in.
Me and Stitch are good buddies, come on.

01:24:24.227 --> 01:24:26.687
Well, merry Christmas,

01:24:26.688 --> 01:24:29.273
old Franky the Thumper!

01:24:29.274 --> 01:24:34.112
I brought you a present
all the way from the North Pole!

01:24:39.909 --> 01:24:42.829
See ya, Stitch!

01:24:46.207 --> 01:24:48.460
Stitch, you idiot!

01:24:59.637 --> 01:25:02.556
<i>I'm gonna sit down here
and just think.</i>

01:25:02.557 --> 01:25:05.225
I ain't had me such a ball
since I don't know when.

01:25:05.226 --> 01:25:08.812
- Me neither, Big Glory.
- You don't have to call me Big Glory.

01:25:08.813 --> 01:25:12.192
- How come?
- Cos I ain't so big, just fat.

01:25:20.450 --> 01:25:27.081
- Well, Fat Glory ain't such a catchy name!
- It ain't catchy, but it's closer to home.

01:25:27.082 --> 01:25:30.834
Before we clone that hell-raising,
I was thinking a lot.

01:25:30.835 --> 01:25:34.755
- You know, I ain't no big deal no more.
- Don't be saying that.

01:25:34.756 --> 01:25:38.133
Listen, I've been thinking about this
for a long time.

01:25:38.134 --> 01:25:41.386
In my mind, I've figured out
I'm living all backwards

01:25:41.387 --> 01:25:46.475
cos all them things that made me
feel good, they happened a long time ago.

01:25:46.476 --> 01:25:49.937
Ain't your handler getting you ready
for some kind of comeback?

01:25:49.938 --> 01:25:53.858
That guy wasn't nothing.
He just worked there.

01:25:55.068 --> 01:26:01.031
- What about all this dough you made?
- I just wrestled for room and board.

01:26:01.032 --> 01:26:04.368
So before I go, I'm just gonna say thanks
for being a buddy.

01:26:04.369 --> 01:26:08.289
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna jump in the river.

01:26:10.959 --> 01:26:13.336
- Why?
- Cos I'm happy.

01:26:15.630 --> 01:26:18.173
I don't get you, Big Glory.

01:26:18.174 --> 01:26:21.426
Well, most people do themselves in
cos they's feeling blue.

01:26:21.427 --> 01:26:25.097
When I'm feeling blue, I ain't
feeling nothing like hurting myself.

01:26:25.098 --> 01:26:29.268
I feels like hurting somebody else,
which ain't right, that's for sure.

01:26:29.269 --> 01:26:31.645
Hey, Glory. I still don't get your drift.

01:26:31.646 --> 01:26:37.359
Well, I always wanted to end it
when I felt good. Tonight, I feels happy.

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:40.154
Come on, let's drive the truck
some more.

01:26:40.155 --> 01:26:44.700
Remember, nobody in this world's gotta
do nothing if they don't have a mind to.

01:26:44.701 --> 01:26:49.079
- Hey, Glory. What about your family?
- You's looking at my family.

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:53.417
Hey, Glory, come on. Let's drive
the stupid truck some more, all right?

01:26:53.418 --> 01:26:57.337
I've made up my mind, boy.
Just thanks to you for being a buddy.

01:26:57.338 --> 01:27:00.215
Give me your word
you won't try that old hero's bit.

01:27:00.216 --> 01:27:05.345
I ain't giving my word. You make me feel
like it's my fault cos my brother beat you.

01:27:05.346 --> 01:27:10.226
Listen, your brother didn't beat me.
I just didn't want it no more.

01:27:18.276 --> 01:27:22.989
You take a long look at that picture, boy,
and do some smart thinking.

01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:31.455
Cosmo, you know, in a hundred years,
this ain't gonna matter none.

01:27:31.456 --> 01:27:34.125
You take care, Santa Claus.

01:27:37.629 --> 01:27:43.300
All these lettuce leaves and fish bones.
Shucks, I can't even find no dirty river.

01:27:43.301 --> 01:27:45.428
You just can't even kill yourself.

01:27:48.181 --> 01:27:51.141
Big Glory, what are you doing?

01:27:51.142 --> 01:27:55.480
You know, in a hundred years,
this <i>still</i> ain't gonna matter none!

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:27.302
Why are you driving the truck?
What are you doing down here?

01:28:27.303 --> 01:28:30.681
- Vic, you've gotta get out.
- Out of what?

01:28:30.682 --> 01:28:35.602
- This wrestling. You gotta get out now.
- Why should he? He's winning big.

01:28:35.603 --> 01:28:39.856
Look, Vic, I'm your brother. I've seen
where you're heading and it's bad.

01:28:39.857 --> 01:28:45.029
Why don't you keep smelling the river and
just stay off his back? I don't need this.

01:28:47.282 --> 01:28:50.576
What is this kind of talk?
You wanna call it a clay?

01:28:52.537 --> 01:28:57.040
What's going on? You wanna quit? Quit.
I thought you were made of stronger stuff.

01:28:57.041 --> 01:29:00.544
- What do you mean?
- I don't know what he thinks, Victor.

01:29:00.545 --> 01:29:03.130
You're the best.

01:29:03.131 --> 01:29:06.800
And you're respected
and we're respected, and you know it.

01:29:06.801 --> 01:29:10.178
It's all cos of that respect
your big match is ready to be made.

01:29:10.179 --> 01:29:11.555
What match?

01:29:11.556 --> 01:29:16.018
- A match worth a $1,000 purse.
- Wait. Who's he gotta wrestle?

01:29:16.019 --> 01:29:19.813
You wanna retire? I'm not stopping you.
I just wish you'd have done this.

01:29:19.814 --> 01:29:23.233
- Why don't you wise up, Vic?
- It goes back to having faith.

01:29:23.234 --> 01:29:26.903
- I got faith.
- You do? Then let me lay this out.

01:29:26.904 --> 01:29:31.366
You see, listen to me or to Cosmo.
We're not pulling back and forth no more.

01:29:31.367 --> 01:29:33.952
- Get off his back!
- You stay off his back!

01:29:33.953 --> 01:29:37.122
I wanna see you respected, rich,
and with your houseboat.

01:29:37.123 --> 01:29:40.042
With this one match,
you don't have to wait years.

01:29:40.043 --> 01:29:42.878
- We'll be on our way to success.
- Who's he wrestling?

01:29:42.879 --> 01:29:45.589
- Franky. We'll be over the top.
- He's over nothing!

01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:47.424
- Just have faith.
- I'll fight.

01:29:47.425 --> 01:29:50.218
- Vic, don't do it.
- I'll set it up. I'll set it up.

01:29:50.219 --> 01:29:54.014
Stop with this faith crap!
You've pushed too hard. He ain't in shape!

01:29:54.015 --> 01:29:57.059
- You set it up and I'll get ya!
- Don't get into him.

01:29:57.060 --> 01:30:01.563
- Hey, Vic. Have you seen your face?
- I don't have to look in the mirror.

01:30:01.564 --> 01:30:05.817
- Do you know where you're heading?
- Yeah, on our houseboat.

01:30:05.818 --> 01:30:10.572
I wanna lay something out for you.
Guys like us, we don't live on houseboats.

01:30:10.573 --> 01:30:13.367
We don't live on houseboats.

01:30:13.368 --> 01:30:16.162
Go on. Go on.

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:32.427
You came here to talk business,
so let's talk.

01:30:32.428 --> 01:30:35.972
- How much you guys wanna wager?
- Make your wager.

01:30:35.973 --> 01:30:39.267
You first, greaseball.

01:30:39.268 --> 01:30:42.270
- 500.
- Peanuts.

01:30:42.271 --> 01:30:46.233
And we can't buy nothing
with peanuts.

01:30:46.234 --> 01:30:51.696
That's what your brother Cosmo's gonna
be worth when we get through with him.

01:30:51.697 --> 01:30:54.075
He broke my window.

01:31:02.250 --> 01:31:05.085
How much money do we have?

01:31:05.086 --> 01:31:08.172
- What do you wanna know for?
- Curious.

01:31:10.174 --> 01:31:13.094
We've got $9,000.

01:31:15.221 --> 01:31:17.598
We bet 9,000.

01:31:19.225 --> 01:31:21.685
That's a very hefty wager.

01:31:21.686 --> 01:31:27.858
For nine grand,
I'd tear my obnoxious, overbearing,

01:31:27.859 --> 01:31:34.364
smelly, ignorant,
sweet mother's face off.

01:31:34.365 --> 01:31:36.241
Yeah.

01:31:36.242 --> 01:31:40.663
That's a very healthy
greaseball wager.

01:31:41.706 --> 01:31:43.916
I wanna talk to my brother.

01:31:53.801 --> 01:31:56.011
- What are you doing?
- I think I can win.

01:31:56.012 --> 01:31:58.139
You "think" you can?

01:32:00.475 --> 01:32:05.562
You lose this fight, we're finished. We're
garbage again. Do you understand this?

01:32:05.563 --> 01:32:07.773
I was never garbage.

01:32:23.372 --> 01:32:26.459
- When do you wanna set this match?
- Tonight.

01:32:27.293 --> 01:32:30.421
- Such short notice.
- You yellow?

01:32:34.675 --> 01:32:36.886
Then tonight it is.

01:32:53.945 --> 01:32:57.697
- You're gonna win tonight, aren't you?
- I'm gonna win.

01:32:57.698 --> 01:33:00.283
- Why are you gonna win?
- Cos you have faith.

01:33:00.284 --> 01:33:02.994
Why don't you get off his back?

01:33:02.995 --> 01:33:04.788
Faith.

01:33:04.789 --> 01:33:08.124
You just make sure you win
cos nothing else counts.

01:33:08.125 --> 01:33:10.001
- You understand?
- Yeah.

01:33:10.002 --> 01:33:13.505
Lenny, you oughta take that cane
and shove it in your ear.

01:33:13.506 --> 01:33:16.258
Your brain's more crippled
than your leg.

01:33:16.259 --> 01:33:18.468
Easy, boys. You're fighting already.

01:33:18.469 --> 01:33:21.930
Hey, Salami. Tonight you're gonna
look like cooked salami.

01:33:21.931 --> 01:33:26.227
All kidding aside, you've come a long way.
I wish you the best of luck.

01:33:27.353 --> 01:33:30.814
Hope you have a lot of insurance.
Can't take a joke?

01:33:30.815 --> 01:33:33.441
The guy's always been an idiot.

01:33:33.442 --> 01:33:35.570
Later.

01:33:38.155 --> 01:33:40.408
No later. Why not now?

01:33:42.118 --> 01:33:44.077
Later.

01:33:44.078 --> 01:33:45.579
Yeah.

01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:48.206
<i>You and me, brother.</i>

01:33:48.207 --> 01:33:50.251
You and me.

01:33:52.086 --> 01:33:53.296
Let's go!

01:33:59.969 --> 01:34:02.345
There's a lot of people here.

01:34:02.346 --> 01:34:05.056
You don't
have to go through with this.

01:34:05.057 --> 01:34:10.270
- You oughta be proud.
- Wait a minute. Why should I be proud?

01:34:10.271 --> 01:34:12.772
You started everything.

01:34:12.773 --> 01:34:14.817
<i>Let's go, Vic!</i>

01:34:34.545 --> 01:34:38.715
First, I'm gonna smash you!
Then I'm gonna get you!

01:34:38.716 --> 01:34:41.635
I'm gonna smash your whole family!

01:34:41.636 --> 01:34:44.888
- Watch your eyes. Everything's on you.
- I know, Lenny.

01:34:44.889 --> 01:34:47.808
- Look, I didn't start nothing.
- It's nice weather.

01:34:51.729 --> 01:34:54.648
Ladies! Ladies and gentlemen!

01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:59.736
Tonight's fantastic bout
will have no time limit!

01:34:59.737 --> 01:35:02.865
No rules will prevail!

01:35:04.492 --> 01:35:07.535
The two contestants will battle

01:35:07.536 --> 01:35:12.123
until one or the other
can no longer continue!

01:35:12.124 --> 01:35:16.461
- Look at those muscles! What a man!
- That guy's loony.

01:35:16.462 --> 01:35:19.506
Hey, you greaseball morons!

01:35:19.507 --> 01:35:23.051
I'm gonna go ahead
and pull your teeth out with my hands!

01:35:23.052 --> 01:35:25.595
I'm gonna pull your eyeballs out

01:35:25.596 --> 01:35:28.765
and I'm gonna squeeze your ugly neck

01:35:28.766 --> 01:35:31.476
until your ugly tongue turns a sick blue!

01:35:31.477 --> 01:35:33.729
You puke!

01:35:35.231 --> 01:35:38.316
<i>Get 'm your comers!</i>

01:35:38.317 --> 01:35:42.320
- Easy, boys! Take it easy.
- Moron! You're the greaseballs!

01:35:42.321 --> 01:35:45.782
- All right, relax. In this corner...
- It's your fault.

01:35:45.783 --> 01:35:48.201
Weighing 290 pounds,

01:35:48.202 --> 01:35:51.705
for the record, a fantastic record

01:35:51.706 --> 01:35:54.082
of 174 wins

01:35:54.083 --> 01:35:56.251
and nine disqualifications,

01:35:56.252 --> 01:36:00.296
the cruel, the insipid
Franky the Thumper!

01:36:00.297 --> 01:36:03.717
Yeah! Come on! Come on!

01:36:03.718 --> 01:36:09.097
- And in this corner, with a record of...
- Hey! Hey! Didn't you forget something?

01:36:09.098 --> 01:36:15.229
Excuse me.
Handled exclusively by Mr Stitch Mahon!

01:36:20.234 --> 01:36:23.278
What's the matter, Stitch?
Don't it float?

01:36:23.279 --> 01:36:25.697
And in this corner,

01:36:25.698 --> 01:36:28.992
weighing 285 pounds,

01:36:28.993 --> 01:36:35.582
with a record of 41 straight victories,
the boy who got his start here...

01:36:35.583 --> 01:36:39.043
- You OK?
- ..In Paradise Alley, our very own,

01:36:39.044 --> 01:36:43.298
Victor "Kid Salami" Carboni!

01:36:43.299 --> 01:36:45.843
<i>Go on.</i>

01:36:49.472 --> 01:36:51.806
You don't have to go through with this.

01:36:51.807 --> 01:36:55.268
- Let's win, Vic.
- I'm gonna take care of you later.

01:36:55.269 --> 01:36:57.395
Use the thumbs.

01:36:57.396 --> 01:36:59.898
His thumbs, Vic.
Watch this creep's thumbs.

01:36:59.899 --> 01:37:02.692
Use the ice clamp on him.
The ice clamp. All right?

01:37:02.693 --> 01:37:08.072
Sammy... let the bout begin!

01:37:08.073 --> 01:37:11.035
That's right! Come on now!

01:37:53.494 --> 01:37:56.538
Get out of my face, you idiots!

01:37:56.539 --> 01:37:58.248
Idiots!

01:37:58.249 --> 01:38:02.794
We're gonna smash you in half!
You're gonna be dead!

01:38:02.795 --> 01:38:06.423
That's it, Franky!
Come on, Frank! Squeeze him!

01:38:07.508 --> 01:38:10.010
Smash him, Franky!
That's it, smash him!

01:38:11.345 --> 01:38:13.638
Hey, that's a foul! Foul!

01:38:13.639 --> 01:38:16.599
Foul! Hey!

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.686
That's a foul!

01:38:21.146 --> 01:38:23.190
Get him, Franky!

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:26.693
Foul! Foul!

01:38:26.694 --> 01:38:30.322
- Come on, Vic.
- Get him out of here!

01:38:41.458 --> 01:38:44.253
I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

01:38:45.713 --> 01:38:48.089
Keep that beast off my brother!

01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:49.757
I'll kill ya!

01:38:49.758 --> 01:38:53.344
- Slow down. Save your strength.
- Everything is fine. I'm happy.

01:38:53.345 --> 01:38:57.473
I don't want you to be happy. I want you
to get mad and I want you to win!

01:38:57.474 --> 01:38:59.475
Stomp him, Franky. Stomp him!

01:38:59.476 --> 01:39:03.980
I don't want nothing left in him,
nothing, just a greasy little wet spot!

01:39:03.981 --> 01:39:08.151
- Look, Vic. Just use the ice clamp.
- I'll tell him what to do from now on.

01:39:08.152 --> 01:39:11.447
- Just use the ice clamp.
- Why don't you guys stop fighting?

01:40:07.002 --> 01:40:09.587
- Hey!
- Hey! Get off him!

01:40:09.588 --> 01:40:12.215
Get off him!
Hey, Vic, are you all right? Vic!

01:40:12.216 --> 01:40:15.093
- Come on. That's a foul!
- Get him over there!

01:40:15.094 --> 01:40:17.679
That's a foul!

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:19.723
Lying creep!

01:40:21.308 --> 01:40:25.311
- He was gonna fall there.
- Sit down, Vic. Come on, sit down.

01:40:25.312 --> 01:40:30.066
- They're frightened! Shut up.
- Worms! Worms! Worms!

01:40:30.067 --> 01:40:34.195
- Don't get careless, Vic. Pick your holds.
- You mean discriminate my holds.

01:40:34.196 --> 01:40:36.447
- Why don't you go out there?
- Shut up!

01:40:36.448 --> 01:40:37.740
I'm gonna smash him!

01:40:37.741 --> 01:40:40.201
- Go get him, baby.
- Give him the ice clamp.

01:40:40.202 --> 01:40:43.622
Why don't you get off his back, Lenny?
Just get off his back.

01:42:27.059 --> 01:42:30.353
- I'm gonna stop this.
- You stop nothing. We got everything.

01:42:30.354 --> 01:42:33.481
- We got nothing! You're gonna kill him!
- Stay out of this!

01:42:33.482 --> 01:42:35.233
- I'm gonna get you!
- You get me!

01:42:35.234 --> 01:42:36.818
Win for me. You're the best.

01:42:36.819 --> 01:42:39.738
- Talk to me. How you doing?
- Excellent. What round is it?

01:42:41.406 --> 01:42:44.618
- The 22nd round!
- Keep it together, Victor.

01:43:26.577 --> 01:43:30.914
We have here a disqualification!
A disqualification!

01:43:32.791 --> 01:43:36.628
- Think again, Burp.
- The winner - Franky the Thumper!

01:43:39.256 --> 01:43:41.841
We gotta get him up! Vic, get up!

01:43:41.842 --> 01:43:47.263
I hope you know the better man won. That
stiff was outclassed. Let's have my dough.

01:43:47.264 --> 01:43:49.765
- Why don't you get out of here?
- What did you say?

01:43:49.766 --> 01:43:52.810
- He said for you scum to get out of here!
- Yeah?

01:43:52.811 --> 01:43:55.022
- Come on! Come on, scum!
- Franky!

01:44:04.573 --> 01:44:07.826
Salami! Salami! Salami! Salami!

01:44:21.882 --> 01:44:24.009
Come on, Franky. Come on.

01:44:25.344 --> 01:44:27.888
Salami! Salami! Salami!

01:44:38.023 --> 01:44:41.943
The winner. The winner!
Victor, we're the winner! We're the winner!

01:44:41.944 --> 01:44:44.779
The winner - Kid Salami! Kid Salami!

01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:47.616
Get out of here, Rat!

01:44:58.252 --> 01:45:00.461
All right.

01:45:00.462 --> 01:45:04.715
- No!
- It's a joke!

01:45:04.716 --> 01:45:07.426
They're not mine!

01:45:07.427 --> 01:45:09.137
It's a joke.

01:45:10.222 --> 01:45:12.599
I'll be back!

01:45:20.816 --> 01:45:22.943
- You weren't hurt?
- No.

01:45:24.152 --> 01:45:27.738
You almost threw the match?
You almost blew everything?

01:45:27.739 --> 01:45:29.782
- Yeah.
- Why?

01:45:29.783 --> 01:45:32.493
Cos I liked it better
when we was just brothers.

01:45:32.494 --> 01:45:36.539
Wait, if you were gonna lose,
why did you wait till the 22nd round?

01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:39.167
I was born on the 22nd,
remember?

01:45:40.919 --> 01:45:44.631
How's it going, Victor?
How's it going?

01:45:46.174 --> 01:45:48.968
Victor! Salami!

01:45:48.969 --> 01:45:52.097
Salami! Salami!

01:45:53.265 --> 01:45:55.142
