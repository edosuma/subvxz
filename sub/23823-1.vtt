31:30.240 --> 31:32.629
My darling, you are recovered.

31:33.840 --> 31:36.400
Curiosity defeated my tiredness.

31:36.440 --> 31:38.954
Sit. Save your strength.

31:45.680 --> 31:50.311
I was just asking Prince Alexander here
to recount his charming story.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.390
Are those your birds, my lady?
<i>—</i> Yes.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.471
My father always let them
fly free in the house.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.271
One of his little indulgences.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.353
I interrupted you, my lord.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.996
<i>—</i> Please.

32:09.520 --> 32:12.512
I was stolen from the palace window
as a baby by wolves.

32:13.600 --> 32:17.434
This shepherd found me on the mountain
and took me into his house.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.596
Unaware of your true nature.

32:19.960 --> 32:21.189
Yes.

32:22.280 --> 32:24.032
He called me Paris.

32:24.080 --> 32:26.754
He taught me to ride and run cattle.

32:26.800 --> 32:28.438
For 20 years, that was my life.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.118
|\/|y lady.

32:30.160 --> 32:33.551
Then, a few weeks ago, I saw the princes
training on the plain.

32:33.600 --> 32:36.069
I challenged them.
<i>—</i> And you won?

32:36.120 --> 32:37.519
Yes.

32:37.560 --> 32:39.870
Until you fought your brother, Hector.

32:39.920 --> 32:40.910
Yes.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.160
He would have killed me.

32:43.200 --> 32:47.353
But my father recognised
me from a birthmark and I was spared.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.356
Show me.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.552
INDISTINCT WHISPERS IN CROWD

32:58.280 --> 33:00.954
To think something so small
could change so much.

33:08.040 --> 33:09.838
How did you two get together?

33:09.880 --> 33:10.836
PANDARUS CLEARS HIS THROAT

33:13.560 --> 33:15.233
No. No, it's fine.

33:16.880 --> 33:19.599
It's a good story and he should know it.

33:20.840 --> 33:22.877
My brother won Helen for me
in competition.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.594
He fought 100 lords for Sparta,

33:26.640 --> 33:28.039
and the right to Helen's hand.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.911
So you didn't win her yourself?

33:36.640 --> 33:38.472
Be careful, Prince.

33:39.840 --> 33:42.229
Your father wrote in his letters
you had much to learn.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.079
What else did he say?

33:48.200 --> 33:50.794
I can't read, so I wouldn't know.

33:50.840 --> 33:52.399
It's time for bed, I think.

33:52.440 --> 33:55.478
The queen must not
over-strain herself and you...

33:55.520 --> 33:58.319
you must be tired after
your long journey.

33:58.360 --> 34:00.556
Everyone keeps telling me
that I should be tired. But, er...

34:03.320 --> 34:04.276
I'm not.

34:04.320 --> 34:05.435
But the queen is.

34:16.040 --> 34:20.159
DISTANT MUSIC SOUNDS

34:31.960 --> 34:34.600
MAN SNORES

34:56.520 --> 34:59.353
WOMEN WHISPER AND GIGGLE

35:56.040 --> 35:58.270
The queen's women are beautiful.

36:00.920 --> 36:02.831
They've been friends of my wife's
since birth.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.992
You're a lucky man.

36:06.040 --> 36:07.030
You think so?

36:08.520 --> 36:09.840
I miss my real home.

36:11.280 --> 36:12.714
Have you been to Mycenae?

36:12.760 --> 36:14.034
No.

36:14.080 --> 36:15.559
You should.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.398
There we have real culture.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.238
This place is a wilderness.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.149
Though I've done my best to tame it.

36:24.800 --> 36:25.915
But look at her.

36:28.640 --> 36:29.710
She's worth it all.

36:30.800 --> 36:31.710
But we were saying...

36:33.040 --> 36:34.030
Helen.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.634
Bring our daughter to meet our guest.

36:45.560 --> 36:46.595
Hermione.

36:51.680 --> 36:53.159
Meet the Prince of Troy.

36:55.120 --> 36:56.918
Beautiful, isn't she?

36:57.840 --> 36:59.160
And with brains to match.

37:01.160 --> 37:02.798
You may go now, Hermione.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.070
No, wait.

37:05.880 --> 37:07.632
Hermione will need a husband soon.

37:09.040 --> 37:12.556
Dynastic marriages strengthen
all parties involved.

37:12.600 --> 37:15.718
They are like hands held fast
across the water.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.915
That's the reason your
father sent you here, Prince.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.279
Or didn't you know?

37:27.080 --> 37:28.559
I'm honoured to be
considered worthy of her.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.037
I didn't say you were.
<i>—</i> Ah.

37:32.720 --> 37:33.710
Not yet.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.435
Come, Hermione.

37:41.240 --> 37:43.993
We should find time to discuss
that other matter, Pandarus.

37:44.040 --> 37:45.838
Whenever you wish, my lord.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.199
Did you know about this?

37:52.240 --> 37:53.435
Why?

37:54.520 --> 37:55.590
Doesn't it please you?

37:55.640 --> 37:56.869
Of course it does.

37:57.760 --> 37:59.398
If it's my father's wish.

38:00.840 --> 38:01.796
And yours.

38:02.320 --> 38:03.469
It's business.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.671
My husband wants a treaty with Troy.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.676
My daughter is part of the deal.

38:10.720 --> 38:13.109
Is Troy that important?

38:13.160 --> 38:15.037
Troy controls the straits from Asia.

38:16.240 --> 38:18.117
Everything passes through your city.

38:19.160 --> 38:21.549
Tin from the east to make bronze.

38:22.520 --> 38:24.238
Spices from India.

38:26.880 --> 38:28.598
So everyone wants a piece.

38:29.520 --> 38:31.716
Welcome to the world, Prince.

38:37.560 --> 38:39.358
Why do you look at me like that?

38:40.160 --> 38:42.390
Surprised I have a mind of my own?

38:44.680 --> 38:46.717
Not surprised in the slightest.

38:48.760 --> 38:49.955
How did you sleep?

38:57.600 --> 38:58.829
Not so well.

39:01.280 --> 39:03.476
In Troy, we've got the sea breeze.

39:03.520 --> 39:04.999
Cools the skin.

39:05.040 --> 39:06.269
Here...

39:07.920 --> 39:09.354
the heat's like a furnace.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.796
And then I thought I heard music.

39:17.080 --> 39:18.878
But maybe I was wrong.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.037
Do you know the story of Actaeon?

39:31.720 --> 39:32.790
No.

39:34.160 --> 39:35.195
Should I?

39:36.840 --> 39:40.196
He spied on the bathing goddess Diana

39:41.360 --> 39:44.193
and was turned into a stag
for his pains.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.795
Dogs chased him through the forest...

39:51.440 --> 39:53.477
and tore his flesh to pieces.

39:57.360 --> 39:59.271
Maybe it was worth it.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.353
PRIAM:
They're staying longer.

40:11.280 --> 40:15.751
Pandarus thinks that Menelaus
will agree to the marriage to his daughter.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.632
I don't like him being away.

40:18.200 --> 40:20.157
He's reckless.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.111
Well, I was reckless at his age

40:22.160 --> 40:23.480
or I'd never have won you.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.750
The gods have forgiven us, Hecuba.

40:30.200 --> 40:31.599
WhY Can't you?

40:33.120 --> 40:36.158
Odysseus of Ithaca sends his
greatest tributes and affections

40:36.200 --> 40:38.760
along with the finest alabaster
from Assyria

40:38.800 --> 40:42.680
Iapis lazuli from Bactra
and jasper from Minoa.

40:42.720 --> 40:47.715
All of Troy is grateful and pays tribute
to the great King Odysseus.

40:52.360 --> 40:55.990
King Agamemnon of Mycenae
sends his respects

40:56.040 --> 40:58.554
and, along with it, a chariot of gold.

41:00.120 --> 41:03.158
King Agamemnon
won the beauteous Helen

41:03.200 --> 41:05.476
and the kingdom of Sparta
for his brother.

41:05.520 --> 41:08.034
He knows the true value of a gem.

41:20.680 --> 41:24.071
May I walk with your daughter, my lord?

41:24.120 --> 41:25.952
It's only right we get to know each other.

41:29.680 --> 41:30.715
Of course.

41:31.560 --> 41:32.959
Hermione.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.957
Show the prince the chamber of silks.

41:47.560 --> 41:49.949
These were a gift from an Indian king.

41:51.680 --> 41:54.035
He tried to buy my mother's hand, but...

41:54.080 --> 41:55.434
she turned him down.

41:56.320 --> 41:57.355
Why?

41:58.880 --> 42:02.111
She refused all offers until her father
forced her to take a husband.

42:02.160 --> 42:03.798
Didn't she want to marry?

42:05.400 --> 42:07.391
Must we always talk about her?

42:10.320 --> 42:12.357
What do you want to talk about?

42:14.320 --> 42:15.549
I don't know.

42:17.040 --> 42:20.237
I'm not sure what to say or do.

42:21.880 --> 42:25.874
I'm not like my mother,
I'm not skilled in these things.

42:29.400 --> 42:30.834
I'm not good with men.

42:32.840 --> 42:34.433
I don't know what to do.

42:35.920 --> 42:36.910
It's alright.

42:38.480 --> 42:39.470
It's alright.

42:50.120 --> 42:51.918
Hermione.

42:51.960 --> 42:54.110
Your father wants to see you.

42:54.160 --> 42:55.798
He asked me to come here.

42:57.400 --> 42:59.471
He didn't ask you
to make a fool of yourself.

43:00.440 --> 43:02.397
I'll show the prince the silks myself.

43:13.440 --> 43:14.714
Stop playing games.

43:17.040 --> 43:18.030
Games, my lady?

43:19.360 --> 43:21.192
It may suit my husband to do so.

43:21.240 --> 43:23.197
It does not suit you.

43:23.240 --> 43:25.550
Hermione's a girl.
She's not ready for courtship.

43:25.600 --> 43:27.113
I wasn't courting her.

43:27.840 --> 43:29.831
I was comforting her.

43:29.880 --> 43:31.154
That's not what it looked like.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.032
Well, that's what it was.

43:34.280 --> 43:36.954
We should go back to the dinner.
<i>—</i> Not yet.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.913
All those bloody dinners.
They're stifling.

43:46.120 --> 43:48.919
These silks were given to my father...

43:48.960 --> 43:50.792
BOTH:
...by an Indian king.

43:50.840 --> 43:52.160
You turned him down.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.476
I know.
<i>—</i> Then there's nothing more to say.

43:56.520 --> 43:57.510
We should go.

44:00.400 --> 44:02.038
Please don't look at me like that.

44:03.040 --> 44:05.236
I'm your hostess
and queen of this palace.

44:05.280 --> 44:06.759
And does that make you happy?

44:07.600 --> 44:09.352
It's no concern of yours how I feel.

44:11.440 --> 44:16.071
I bet this palace was once very different
when it was yours and your father's.

44:17.120 --> 44:18.519
And you were different, too.

44:20.360 --> 44:21.794
What do you mean?

44:21.840 --> 44:25.037
Your world here was wild.

44:25.080 --> 44:26.878
Your civilised husband didn't want that.

44:26.920 --> 44:28.957
It scared him. So he tamed it.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.354
And he tamed you, too.

44:30.840 --> 44:33.434
I'm a woman.
We don't get to select our fate.

44:33.480 --> 44:34.470
What fate?!

44:35.880 --> 44:38.554
A life of gritting your teeth
through banquets?

44:38.600 --> 44:40.352
Drugging yourself into oblivion?

44:41.160 --> 44:43.515
<i>I know</i> what freedom is.

44:43.560 --> 44:45.836
And this... this isn't it.

44:48.040 --> 44:49.269
You're royal now.

44:50.280 --> 44:53.352
Duty will be your master, too.
— No one can master me.

44:57.840 --> 44:58.955
Except maybe you.

45:00.240 --> 45:01.958
Be careful what you say.

45:04.200 --> 45:06.350
Caution never got me anywhere.

45:07.400 --> 45:09.357
What gives you the right?

45:11.880 --> 45:12.870
The gods.

45:17.240 --> 45:18.230
Please don't.

45:20.880 --> 45:22.757
Are you happy?

45:22.800 --> 45:24.154
Tell me yes and I'll go.

45:24.200 --> 45:26.510
I'll marry your daughter,
just as they all want.

45:30.200 --> 45:31.918
POUNDING ON DOOR

45:35.360 --> 45:38.671
POUNDING CONTINUES

45:38.720 --> 45:39.710
MAN:
Open up!

45:41.920 --> 45:43.240
What is it?

45:43.280 --> 45:45.510
My lady, I come from Mycenae.

45:45.560 --> 45:47.278
The king's father is dead.

45:54.720 --> 45:56.154
Your father.

46:04.360 --> 46:06.271
My brother's set sail for Crete.

46:06.920 --> 46:08.115
I'm to join him there for the funeral.

46:08.160 --> 46:11.869
I'll come with you.
<i>—</i> No, we have a guest. You stay.

46:11.920 --> 46:14.594
My lord, if it's easier for us to leave,
just say.

46:14.640 --> 46:17.473
I'll not hear it.
My father has been sick for some time.

46:17.520 --> 46:19.033
His death was not unexpected.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.559
But we must look to the future.

46:22.640 --> 46:23.960
Celebrate new alliances.

46:28.320 --> 46:30.960
You have spirit, Alexander.
I admire that.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.031
Please, stay.

46:36.360 --> 46:37.759
Get to know Hermione.

46:40.160 --> 46:41.150
Come, Helen.

46:54.360 --> 46:55.316
Five days.

47:18.400 --> 47:21.995
HELEN:
Grant his soul joy, give him peace.

47:22.040 --> 47:26.318
HELEN AND WOMEN IN UNISON:
Grant his soul joy, give him peace.

47:26.360 --> 47:29.432
Grant his soul joy, give him peace.

47:29.480 --> 47:32.711
Grant his soul joy, give him peace

47:34.520 --> 47:37.160
Death be his welcome god.

47:37.200 --> 47:39.271
Let him into your majesty.

47:39.320 --> 47:40.958
Give him peace.

47:42.200 --> 47:44.271
Death be his welcome god.

47:44.320 --> 47:46.630
Let him into your majesty.

47:46.680 --> 47:48.000
Give him peace.

47:49.280 --> 47:51.874
Death be his welcome god.

47:51.920 --> 47:54.275
Let him into your majesty.

47:54.320 --> 47:55.719
Give him peace.

47:57.080 --> 47:59.549
Death be his welcome god.

47:59.600 --> 48:01.716
Let him into your majesty.

48:01.760 --> 48:04.036
Give him peace.

48:04.080 --> 48:07.357
Death be his welcome god.

48:07.400 --> 48:09.835
Let him into your majesty.

48:09.880 --> 48:11.075
Give him peace.

48:12.840 --> 48:13.989
Brother.

48:22.080 --> 48:28.076
HELEN AND WOMEN CONTINUE
TO WHISPER PRAYER

48:38.200 --> 48:40.396
Death be his welcome god.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.911
Let him into your majesty.

48:46.520 --> 48:48.909
Death be his welcome god.

48:56.880 --> 48:58.871
Why do you stare at her chair?

49:03.200 --> 49:04.190
Men are fools.

49:10.120 --> 49:12.760
My lord!
<i>—</i> Pack the bags. We're leaving.

49:12.800 --> 49:15.838
His highness asked...
<i>—</i> I don't care what he asked!

49:15.880 --> 49:17.234
THUNDER CLAPS

49:17.280 --> 49:18.953
A storm is coming.
We must wait till morning.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.593
No, we're leaving now!

49:22.840 --> 49:25.434
My lord! My um!

49:27.120 --> 49:29.031
We must wait till morning!

49:35.560 --> 49:37.915
PANDARUS:
Get these carts loaded! Quickly!

49:37.960 --> 49:39.473
MAN: Yes, sir.

49:41.880 --> 49:43.678
Come on!

49:45.120 --> 49:46.269
Get these loaded.

49:49.840 --> 49:51.558
Get these loaded, come on.

49:59.160 --> 50:00.559
HE SCREAMS

50:06.360 --> 50:07.350
KNOCK AT DOOR

51:06.760 --> 51:08.319
Why didn't you leave?

51:11.440 --> 51:12.555
I tried.

51:21.480 --> 51:22.993
The gods didn't let me.

51:27.720 --> 51:29.358
I tried to hide from you.

51:31.760 --> 51:32.875
I locked my door.

51:35.840 --> 51:36.955
I couldn't sleep.

51:40.480 --> 51:41.993
Three clays in darkness.

51:44.800 --> 51:45.835
I've gone mad.

51:47.600 --> 51:48.829
You've made me mad.

52:08.840 --> 52:12.913
THUNDER RUMBLES

53:03.840 --> 53:05.194
What?

53:09.560 --> 53:11.597
I was thinking about your name.

53:13.280 --> 53:14.350
Paris.

53:17.800 --> 53:18.790
I like it.

53:20.840 --> 53:21.955
It suits you better.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.479
There's something I haven't told you.

53:43.320 --> 53:44.913
When I was a shepherd...

53:48.160 --> 53:52.836
I was told by Aphrodite I'd meet
the world's most beautiful woman...

53:54.520 --> 53:57.512
and that she'd be mine.

53:59.360 --> 54:00.839
And you think that's me?

54:00.880 --> 54:01.870
I'm sure of it.

54:02.720 --> 54:03.710
You're a fool.

54:09.040 --> 54:12.590
PANDARUS:
My lord! My lord!

54:14.640 --> 54:16.950
PANDARUS:
Prince Alexander!

54:18.920 --> 54:19.830
MY lord!

54:22.280 --> 54:24.078
Your men are calling.

54:24.120 --> 54:25.155
PANDARUS:
My lord!

54:31.520 --> 54:32.840
You should go.

54:32.880 --> 54:34.279
I can't leave you.

54:36.560 --> 54:38.995
They can't find you here.
My husband will have you killed.

54:39.840 --> 54:41.114
When will I see you again?

54:42.080 --> 54:43.070
I don't know.

54:43.880 --> 54:45.200
Maybe at your wedding to my daughter.

54:45.240 --> 54:47.516
That will never happen.
<i>—</i> Well, then, never.

54:51.240 --> 54:53.629
Just go. Please.
<i>—</i> Come with me.

54:56.680 --> 54:58.273
I can't.

54:58.320 --> 55:01.358
Come now,
before your husband gets back.

55:01.400 --> 55:03.676
It's impossible. I'd be seen.
People would know.

55:03.720 --> 55:06.075
You say that you are a woman
and that you have no choice in life.

55:06.120 --> 55:08.396
But that's not true.
You have a choice now.

55:08.440 --> 55:09.919
I have a daughter.

55:11.440 --> 55:13.078
I can't just walk away.

55:14.400 --> 55:16.755
She doesn't deserve that.
<i>—</i> And what about you?

55:20.040 --> 55:21.474
What do you deserve?

55:33.680 --> 55:37.275
Please, just... just go!

55:49.440 --> 55:51.113
PARIS:
Are the horses ready?

55:51.160 --> 55:55.472
Yes, and the weather's much improved.
Make peace. We're not done here.

55:55.520 --> 55:57.272
HERMIONE:
You're leaving.

55:57.320 --> 55:58.879
I'm afraid so.

55:58.920 --> 56:00.752
When will you return?

56:02.240 --> 56:06.518
My lord, the queen sends her apologies.
She is feeling unwell.

56:06.560 --> 56:07.630
She won't be down to say goodbye.

56:09.320 --> 56:12.039
She is sending a gift for your mother,
Queen Hecuba.

56:13.080 --> 56:15.037
See that it's carefully loaded
onto the ship.

56:20.160 --> 56:21.992
My mother should be here
to bid you farewell.

56:23.320 --> 56:24.594
What does it matter?

56:25.640 --> 56:27.039
Is that why you're leaving early?

56:28.000 --> 56:29.195
Because of her?

56:32.080 --> 56:34.833
She rejected you, didn't she?

56:38.240 --> 56:39.275
Don't come back.

56:55.600 --> 56:56.954
Let's get going.

57:00.440 --> 57:01.510
Let's go!

57:33.400 --> 57:36.995
King Priam seeks your blessing
for this new child.

57:38.160 --> 57:40.197
Oh, gods, be merciful.

58:35.280 --> 58:38.159
Where is my wife?!

58:38.200 --> 58:40.760
I'm not a possession, I'm a woman.

58:40.800 --> 58:42.518
I think, I feel.

58:42.560 --> 58:46.918
What if they come for her?
Agamemnon needs no excuse for a fight.

58:47.520 --> 58:48.715
We are running out of time.

58:48.760 --> 58:51.149
Your wedding will bless
the voyage to Troy.

58:51.200 --> 58:53.350
This doesn't look like a marriage altar.

58:54.560 --> 58:57.313
Last time there was a war here,
I was your age.

58:57.360 --> 59:00.751
WOMAN: / <i>Want your loyalty, Zeus,
to Greece and to me.</i>

59:00.800 --> 59:02.632
This city bows to no one.

59:02.680 --> 59:06.958
We will bring the rage of the gods down
on your Asiatic heads!
