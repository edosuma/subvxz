WEBVTT

00:02.367 --> 00:04.469
Ok. Ok.

00:04.470 --> 00:06.571
The show is over,
and it's still smoking.

00:06.572 --> 00:08.740
I did this for a reason, al.
That would be?

00:08.741 --> 00:12.110
Now the crowd knows
exactly what happens
when you overcharge a battery.

00:12.111 --> 00:14.445
It swells up and does this.

00:18.050 --> 00:21.152
Hey, guys. You seen
this month's <i>detroit life?</i>
Not yet.

00:21.153 --> 00:24.489
Guess who's one of
the sexiest ten bachelors
in the city.

00:24.490 --> 00:26.891
Someone we know?
Someone who works
on the show.

00:26.892 --> 00:30.729
I bet it's marv.
I've always found marv
attractive.

00:32.363 --> 00:35.800
Marv's ok,
but he's no vic.

00:35.801 --> 00:38.503
It's not marv or vic.
It's al.

00:38.504 --> 00:41.339
Who?
What?

00:41.340 --> 00:44.475
Congratulations, al.
Thank you.

00:46.078 --> 00:49.147
I must say I'm...
I'm very flattered.

00:49.148 --> 00:51.650
I must say
I'm very frightened.

00:53.152 --> 00:55.787
Listen to this. "what woman
wouldn't wanna cuddle up

00:55.788 --> 00:59.557
With detroit's rugged
mr. Fix-it, al borland?"

01:02.061 --> 01:04.462
"along with
his trademark humility,

01:04.462 --> 01:06.798
"al displays
a quiet competence

01:06.799 --> 01:09.067
And an understated
sense of humor."

01:09.068 --> 01:12.070
So understated,
no one gets it.

01:12.071 --> 01:14.773
Obviously someone did.
Huh?

01:14.774 --> 01:16.440
"his big, beaming smile

01:16.441 --> 01:19.277
Matches his big,
beaming behind."

01:21.080 --> 01:25.016
It doesn't say that!
Well, it should.

01:25.017 --> 01:27.652
Well, wait a minute.
You're in here.
What's it say?

01:27.653 --> 01:31.289
"as usual, the borland charm
is a much-needed antidote

01:31.290 --> 01:33.825
To the overblown
macho displays

01:33.826 --> 01:36.394
Of the accident-prone host
tim taylor."

01:36.395 --> 01:37.996
<i>(mock laughter)</i>

01:37.997 --> 01:41.299
Accident-prone.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

02:31.550 --> 02:33.985
All right,
give me another problem.

02:33.986 --> 02:36.788
Ok. "bill's car goes
40 miles per hour.

02:36.789 --> 02:39.457
"mary's car goes
60 miles per hour.

02:39.458 --> 02:43.194
How long will it take
for each of them
to go 120 miles?"

02:43.195 --> 02:46.965
All right. What size motors
do they have?

02:46.966 --> 02:49.634
What?
Well, is it automatic
or manual transmission?

02:49.635 --> 02:51.569
That's gotta make
a difference.
Dad.

02:51.570 --> 02:54.672
The answer is
bill, three hours,
mary, two.

02:54.673 --> 02:57.242
Thanks.

02:57.243 --> 03:00.245
I shouldn't be helping you
with your math homework
anyway.

03:00.246 --> 03:02.380
You're not.

03:03.715 --> 03:05.683
All right, what's
your english assignment?

03:05.684 --> 03:09.620
Well, I have to do a report
on the most interesting person
I know.

03:09.621 --> 03:11.555
<i>(sighs)</i>

03:11.556 --> 03:15.393
I was born in middle michigan.
It was an autumn birth.

03:15.394 --> 03:17.395
A breech baby. It was
a really difficult birth...
Dad.

03:17.396 --> 03:21.866
Dad, I'm not sure you're
the most interesting person
I know.

03:21.867 --> 03:25.270
I'm not sure
he's the most interesting
person in this room.

03:26.872 --> 03:30.508
Maybe I'll do wilson.
Wilson?

03:30.509 --> 03:34.012
Wilson?
What interesting thing
is he gonna tell you?

03:34.013 --> 03:36.580
Well, how about his dinner
with einstein?

03:36.581 --> 03:38.817
Wow! He had dinner
with einstein?

03:38.818 --> 03:41.286
Really overrated guy.

03:41.287 --> 03:43.788
If he knew so much
about gravity,

03:43.789 --> 03:47.225
How come his hair
stood up like that?

03:47.226 --> 03:50.261
You should write the story
about me.

03:50.262 --> 03:52.496
I think I'll stick
with wilson.

03:53.665 --> 03:54.665
Hi, guys.
Hi, mom.

03:54.666 --> 03:56.567
Hi, honey. Hey, brad.

03:56.568 --> 03:58.669
Who's the most interesting man
that you know?

03:58.670 --> 04:00.271
Wilson.

04:01.773 --> 04:04.742
Did you see this magazine?

04:04.743 --> 04:08.246
Al was voted one of
the ten sexiest bachelors
in detroit.

04:08.247 --> 04:10.481
Yeah, I saw it.
Where is it? There.

04:10.482 --> 04:14.552
Which explains why
all the single women I saw
were heading towards cleveland.

04:14.553 --> 04:17.521
I can see how some women
would find al sexy.

04:17.522 --> 04:20.959
I guess if you never saw
another man before.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.861
You just don't get it.

04:22.862 --> 04:25.129
Sexiness is something
that comes from the inside.

04:25.130 --> 04:26.998
It's something
that you exude.

04:26.999 --> 04:29.734
Well, it's my opinion
that anything al exudes

04:29.735 --> 04:32.203
Should stay on the inside.

04:35.274 --> 04:38.109
Does everybody know
what time it is?
<i>Tool time!</i>

04:38.110 --> 04:40.111
That's right. Binford tools
is proud to present

04:40.112 --> 04:43.047
Tim "the tool man" taylor.
Whoo-hoo!

04:48.187 --> 04:50.688
Thank you, everybody,
and welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

04:50.689 --> 04:54.359
I am tim "the tool man" taylor,
and you all know my assistant
al "I wish I..."

04:54.360 --> 04:57.228
<i>(cheering)</i>

04:59.298 --> 05:02.200
Well, I guess we all read
the article, didn't we?

05:02.201 --> 05:04.068
I love you, al.

05:04.069 --> 05:06.271
Thank you.

05:06.272 --> 05:10.008
It's gosh darn nice
to have all you ladies
in the audience with us today.

05:10.009 --> 05:13.044
You'll enjoy the show,
'cause we're gonna talk
about french doors today.

05:13.045 --> 05:15.679
We wanna talk about al.
Yeah.

05:18.750 --> 05:22.053
Well, actually,
al and french doors
share something in common.

05:22.054 --> 05:24.956
They're both things
I like to slam.

05:27.293 --> 05:29.794
The important thing to remember
about putting in doors

05:29.795 --> 05:31.963
Is you want to secure 'em,
straighten 'em up,

05:31.964 --> 05:34.632
Plumb 'em and make sure that
they're in there straight.

05:34.633 --> 05:38.069
Could you move so we could
get a better view of al?

05:40.005 --> 05:42.073
Is this better?
Well, now I can't see.

05:44.076 --> 05:46.844
Ladies, this is
a tool show, ok?
All right?

05:46.845 --> 05:49.247
We're gonna use shims here,
as he hammers 'em in
to make sure the...

05:49.248 --> 05:51.649
Excuse me.
Could I ask a question?

05:51.650 --> 05:54.685
Oh, gosh darn it,
why not?

05:54.686 --> 05:56.454
Has al ever been married?

05:56.455 --> 05:58.456
If we're gonna
ask questions,

05:58.457 --> 06:00.491
They should be
about french doors.

06:00.492 --> 06:02.493
Would al be more likely
to marry someone

06:02.494 --> 06:04.695
Who had french doors?

06:04.696 --> 06:09.467
Actually, I'm partial to women
with all sorts of doors.

06:09.468 --> 06:11.669
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

06:14.006 --> 06:16.474
Dutch doors,
sliding glass doors...

06:16.475 --> 06:19.210
Keep going.
Any other kind of doors?

06:19.211 --> 06:20.911
No.

06:22.247 --> 06:23.314
All right -

06:23.315 --> 06:26.284
What kind of windows
does al like in a woman?

06:26.285 --> 06:30.221
Actually, I'm partial
to bay or louvered.

06:30.222 --> 06:32.256
Or broken.

06:38.063 --> 06:40.264
And I would like
to thank jill

06:40.265 --> 06:42.666
For introducing me
to ilene.

06:42.667 --> 06:46.904
And, ilene, here's to
another great 15 months.

06:46.905 --> 06:50.308
It's been the happiest
15 months of my life.

06:51.810 --> 06:53.978
That is so romantic.

06:53.979 --> 06:56.381
Sure is. I want pork.

06:57.883 --> 06:59.884
Hi. I'm shelly,

06:59.885 --> 07:01.919
And I'll be your waitress
this evening.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.787
I'm single,
I want a relationship

07:03.788 --> 07:06.891
And I like long walks
on the beach.

07:08.494 --> 07:12.596
I'm starving, I want pork
and I'd like a glass of water.

07:12.597 --> 07:15.566
We have some
lovely appetizers
this evening.

07:15.567 --> 07:18.802
May I recommend
the raw oysters?

07:18.803 --> 07:20.571
Are they fresh?

07:20.572 --> 07:23.774
I shucked them myself.

07:23.775 --> 07:26.644
Sounds great.
I'll have that.
I'll have the -

07:26.645 --> 07:28.879
Shelly,
we're hungry, too.

07:30.615 --> 07:34.419
She just took one
of her long walks.
<i>(laughs)</i>

07:34.420 --> 07:37.655
<i>(women imitate shelly)</i>
"I shucked them myself."

07:37.656 --> 07:39.390
<i>(tim laughs)</i>

07:39.391 --> 07:41.926
Everywhere we go,
the women have been flocking
to his flannel.

07:41.927 --> 07:43.428
They haven't.
Really?

07:43.429 --> 07:45.363
And there's nothing worse
in this world

07:45.364 --> 07:47.265
Than a flagrant
flannel flocker.

07:49.168 --> 07:51.369
Excuse me. I don't mean
to interrupt,

07:51.370 --> 07:54.272
But, mr. Borland,
I just have to tell you

07:54.273 --> 07:57.641
You're even more handsome
than you were in the magazine.

07:57.642 --> 08:01.546
Can I have your autograph?
Please, call me al.

08:01.547 --> 08:03.881
I'm such a fan of your show.

08:03.882 --> 08:05.883
Well, that's very gratifying
to hear.

08:05.884 --> 08:08.219
Tim and I always try
to do our best.

08:08.220 --> 08:09.820
Who's tim?

08:14.293 --> 08:15.493
Oh.
Bye.

08:15.494 --> 08:16.660
Bye.

08:16.661 --> 08:19.197
Uh, excuse me, miss.
You forgot something.

08:19.198 --> 08:21.699
She didn't
forget anything, al.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.767
She just gave you
her phone number.

08:23.768 --> 08:26.870
Can you believe that woman?
I mean, she could see
that you were with him.

08:26.871 --> 08:30.374
She's going for al.
Maybe she can't see.

08:30.375 --> 08:32.710
Anyway, ilene,
tell us what's going on

08:32.711 --> 08:35.044
In the fast-paced world
of orthodontia.

08:35.046 --> 08:36.714
Oh, it's very exciting.

08:36.715 --> 08:39.049
I just got back from
a symposium on overbites,

08:39.049 --> 08:42.419
And the most interesting thing
happened.

08:45.524 --> 08:47.791
What are you doing, al?

08:47.792 --> 08:49.260
Waving.

08:49.261 --> 08:51.762
I'm in the middle of a story.

08:51.763 --> 08:54.932
Well, I was just being polite.

08:54.933 --> 08:58.869
I feel I have a responsibility
to my public.

08:58.870 --> 09:02.973
Your public? A few days ago
you didn't have a public.

09:02.974 --> 09:04.475
Well, yes, I did.

09:04.476 --> 09:06.710
They just didn't know
who I was.

09:06.711 --> 09:09.813
You know, the way you're acting
I'm not sure I know who you are.

09:09.814 --> 09:13.484
Well, I'm still
the same old al borland.

09:13.485 --> 09:15.486
Hey.

09:15.487 --> 09:18.922
Excuse me. I'm going
to the ladies' room.
Ilene, I... I didn't...

09:18.923 --> 09:20.924
I think, um,
I'll go with you.

09:20.925 --> 09:23.227
I'm right behind you,
girls.

09:24.863 --> 09:27.798
I suppose I can hold it.

09:27.799 --> 09:30.100
What is ilene
so upset about?

09:30.101 --> 09:32.102
Let me give you
a little piece of advice.

09:32.103 --> 09:34.405
When you're out with ilene,
next time you wave
at a strange woman,

09:34.406 --> 09:36.407
You'd better be riding
in a float in a parade.

09:36.408 --> 09:39.243
Well, it's not my fault
that...

09:39.244 --> 09:42.213
That all these women are
paying attention to me.

09:42.214 --> 09:44.348
Oh, yeah, you're a real
babe magnet right now.

09:44.349 --> 09:46.083
I wouldn't go that far.

09:46.084 --> 09:48.085
Hello.

09:49.854 --> 09:51.556
Hello, I'm al magnet.

09:51.557 --> 09:53.558
I-I mean, al...
Al borland,

09:53.559 --> 09:55.660
And it's very nice
to meet you.

09:55.661 --> 09:57.895
Christine dempsey.
Christine.

09:57.896 --> 10:01.532
Sorry to bother you,
but, um, I've broken my heel,

10:01.533 --> 10:04.735
And I read about how good
you are with your hands.

10:04.736 --> 10:08.472
You know, I have a tool kit
for just such an emergency.

10:09.974 --> 10:12.343
He also has an emergency
inflatable raft

10:12.344 --> 10:14.378
In case the kitchen floods.
Ha-ha!

10:14.379 --> 10:17.682
You know, the kitchen...
Kitchen?

10:17.683 --> 10:20.351
Oh, boy.

10:20.352 --> 10:23.621
You have a very lovely foot.

10:23.622 --> 10:25.623
A very lovely knee.

10:25.624 --> 10:28.192
And a heck of a thigh.

10:28.193 --> 10:30.595
I wouldn't go any higher, al.

10:30.596 --> 10:32.597
Your hands are so warm.

10:32.598 --> 10:35.666
Well, I've always had
very good circulation.

10:35.667 --> 10:38.969
You're about ready to be put
out of circulation, al.

10:38.970 --> 10:40.471
Al!

10:42.073 --> 10:45.276
I-I'm sorry, um...

10:45.277 --> 10:47.778
Uh, christine. Um...

10:47.779 --> 10:51.449
Ilene, christine.
Christine, ilene.

10:51.450 --> 10:55.119
Ilene is my friend.
Your friend?
I'm your friend?

10:55.120 --> 10:57.020
My good friend.
Girlfriend.

10:57.021 --> 11:00.458
Girlfriend. That's the word
I was - I was looking for.

11:07.566 --> 11:09.567
Al, what is happening
to you?

11:09.568 --> 11:11.736
You were flirting
with all these other women.

11:11.737 --> 11:13.738
It's like
I don't even exist.

11:13.739 --> 11:16.840
Ilene, that's not true!
It's...

11:18.076 --> 11:20.210
Oh... Excuse me, please.

11:20.211 --> 11:23.213
<i>(sexy voice)</i> hi, al.

11:36.027 --> 11:37.528
Sir?

11:37.529 --> 11:39.697
Need more butter.

11:47.205 --> 11:50.207
Well... I think that
they're talking out there.

11:50.208 --> 11:52.476
I cannot believe
that he acted that way.

11:52.477 --> 11:54.978
He was flirting
with every woman
in this place.

11:54.979 --> 11:56.980
Those women were
coming on to him.

11:56.981 --> 11:59.483
He's like a completely
different person.
Which is good.

11:59.484 --> 12:02.186
Usually on Saturday night,
he's out clog dancing
with his mother.

12:02.187 --> 12:04.188
He's starting to act
like a normal guy.

12:04.189 --> 12:06.490
You think it's normal
to ignore a woman

12:06.491 --> 12:08.326
On your 15-month anniversary?

12:08.327 --> 12:10.328
I don't think it's normal

12:10.329 --> 12:13.664
To celebrate
a 15-month anniversary.

12:13.665 --> 12:17.468
Give the guy a break.
He's just living out
every guy's fantasy.

12:17.469 --> 12:19.370
Excuse me?
<i>Every</i> guy's fantasy?

12:19.371 --> 12:22.506
Every guy's fanta...
Single guys.

12:22.507 --> 12:25.042
You know, married guys
don't have fantasies.

12:25.043 --> 12:27.545
They're taken away from them.

12:29.214 --> 12:31.649
It's a good thing,

12:31.650 --> 12:33.951
'cause then you get to,
you know,

12:33.952 --> 12:36.954
Give all your attention
to your wife, you know,
year after year.

12:36.955 --> 12:38.956
You know,
month in, month out,

12:38.957 --> 12:41.826
Day after day
until you're dead.

12:43.962 --> 12:47.197
You've just swept me
off my feet all over again.

12:47.198 --> 12:49.867
Where's al?
He left.

12:49.868 --> 12:50.968
Ohh!

12:50.969 --> 12:53.738
Wait. Shelly,
we could use the -

12:53.739 --> 12:56.874
You're killing your tip, shel.

12:56.875 --> 13:00.210
If you're not gonna finish
any of that, you know...
Tim! Sorry.

13:00.211 --> 13:04.147
Well, ilene
just refused to talk to me.
She got in the cab and left.

13:04.148 --> 13:06.049
Well, I don't blame her.

13:06.050 --> 13:08.652
Now, get in your car
and go after her.

13:08.653 --> 13:10.821
I'm not sure
I wanna do that.
I wouldn't, either.

13:10.822 --> 13:13.123
You didn't do
anything wrong.
No, I didn't.

13:13.124 --> 13:16.594
That's not
what you think,
is it, tim?

13:16.595 --> 13:18.763
It's not?

13:18.764 --> 13:20.398
No.

13:20.399 --> 13:22.500
What do you think?

13:26.571 --> 13:29.407
I don't know. Ask her.

13:33.912 --> 13:37.080
He thinks that
ever since you read
that magazine article

13:37.081 --> 13:40.918
That you've lost that -
that teddy-bear quality
we all love.

13:40.919 --> 13:42.420
He still has that.

13:42.421 --> 13:45.122
Every girl in detroit wants
to squeeze the stuffing
out of him.

13:45.123 --> 13:46.657
That's right.
Everywhere...

13:46.658 --> 13:48.826
Tim, I think that
you should tell him

13:48.827 --> 13:50.828
If he keeps behaving
like this,

13:50.829 --> 13:54.231
He's going to lose ilene,
and she is the best thing
that ever happened to him.

13:54.232 --> 13:58.035
She is the only thing
that ever happened to him.
Well, that's not true.

13:58.036 --> 14:01.104
Would you please be serious
and just talk some sense
into him?

14:01.105 --> 14:04.174
You want me to tell him
that being wanted by every girl
in detroit is a bad thing?

14:04.175 --> 14:06.310
Yes.
And do that
with a straight face?

14:06.311 --> 14:07.545
Yes.

14:11.983 --> 14:13.317
Al...

14:13.318 --> 14:16.420
I can't say that.
I can't do it.

14:16.421 --> 14:19.056
You're just gonna sit there
and not say anything?

14:19.057 --> 14:20.991
I'll say something.

14:20.992 --> 14:23.026
Al, call the waitress.

14:23.027 --> 14:25.362
Tell her we want pork.

14:30.301 --> 14:33.370
<i>(♪ long low note)</i>

14:35.073 --> 14:37.675
What are you doing,
wilson?

14:37.676 --> 14:39.677
Randy, I'm making
an alpenhorn.

14:39.678 --> 14:43.948
You see, in switzerland
they use these to herd sheep.
Are you getting a sheep?

14:43.949 --> 14:46.684
Actually, I'm making it
to play in the local
alpenhorn quintet,

14:46.685 --> 14:48.686
And you boys are welcome
to come out this Saturday,

14:48.687 --> 14:51.956
Be my guests at the annual
horn and yodel fest.

14:51.957 --> 14:53.991
Sounds like a rockin'
good time, wilson,

14:53.992 --> 14:58.195
But I'm already going
to that clarinet
and noodle fest.

14:58.196 --> 15:00.297
Hey, wilson,
can I talk to you?

15:00.298 --> 15:03.100
Well, yes.
I'm all ears, mark.

15:03.101 --> 15:05.102
I have this report due

15:05.103 --> 15:08.606
On the most interesting person
I know, and I picked you.

15:08.607 --> 15:11.041
Why, mark,
I am so flattered.

15:11.042 --> 15:13.577
Did you really know einstein?

15:13.578 --> 15:16.747
Oh, I not only knew him,
I had dinner
with the great scientist.

15:16.748 --> 15:17.982
Wow.

15:17.983 --> 15:20.317
Oh, yes, indeed.
It was over appetizers

15:20.318 --> 15:22.686
That he regaled me
with his theory of relativity,

15:22.687 --> 15:24.755
And then
when the main course came,

15:24.756 --> 15:27.257
He spoke
of other great theories.

15:27.258 --> 15:29.660
Mark, are you familiar
with photons?

15:29.661 --> 15:33.230
Sure. I slept on one
at my friend jimmy's house.

15:33.231 --> 15:36.033
No, mark, I think
you're speaking of futons.

15:36.034 --> 15:37.367
See, according to einstein,

15:37.368 --> 15:39.937
Light consists of
energy packets called quanta,

15:39.938 --> 15:42.339
Which later became known
as photons.

15:42.340 --> 15:47.244
Well, that's great, wilson,
but can you tell me something
about him that's interesting?

15:47.245 --> 15:51.081
You know, mark,
I'm thinking physics
may not be your cup of tea.

15:51.082 --> 15:53.483
Mark, what are you
interested in?

15:53.484 --> 15:57.021
Oh, lots of things -
cars, tools, sports.

15:57.022 --> 15:58.589
Hey, guys.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.591
You know, mark,

16:00.592 --> 16:05.395
I may not be the person
you want to speak to
about this.

16:05.396 --> 16:07.464
Gotcha, wilson.

16:07.465 --> 16:09.033
Hey, dad.
What, son?

16:09.034 --> 16:11.234
Have you ever had dinner
with any interesting people?

16:11.235 --> 16:14.605
Oh, you bet.
Felix myman, the great plumber.

16:14.606 --> 16:16.974
You see, mark, see,
that's a lot more interesting

16:16.975 --> 16:19.176
Than einstein
and his theory of relativity.

16:19.177 --> 16:21.812
Right. Felix had a theory
called "clogativity."

16:21.813 --> 16:25.348
It has to do with
toilet paper and toilets.
Cool!

16:25.349 --> 16:28.285
It's a smelly theory,
but it's really kinda neat,
you know?

16:28.286 --> 16:30.287
He came up with this thing -

16:30.288 --> 16:33.323
With enough air pressure,
you can shatter porcelain
with one blast.

16:33.324 --> 16:35.525
Tim.
Where have you been?

16:35.526 --> 16:39.029
You gotta hear what happened
to me when I got home from
the restaurant last night.

16:39.030 --> 16:42.733
Al, you're an hour late.
Well, I had a lot of calls
to return from my admirers.

16:42.734 --> 16:45.869
It's a good thing
I got this cellular phone.

16:47.371 --> 16:49.372
Cellular phone, al?
That's right.

16:49.373 --> 16:51.441
Oh, and listen,
if anybody asks,

16:51.442 --> 16:53.443
Here's my number.

16:53.444 --> 16:55.613
Ok, I'll drop it off
at the pound.

16:55.614 --> 16:57.815
<i>(laughs)</i> good one.

16:57.816 --> 17:00.417
So, anyway, when I get home,
in the parking garage,

17:00.418 --> 17:02.419
Two women are waiting for me.

17:02.420 --> 17:03.587
Twins.

17:03.588 --> 17:06.256
Maybe they needed
a place to park, al.

17:06.257 --> 17:09.093
Well, they wanted
to park al, all right.

17:10.996 --> 17:13.497
Those women really wanted
to get their hands

17:13.498 --> 17:16.000
On "detroit's
rugged mr. Fix-it,"

17:16.001 --> 17:18.335
And who could blame them?

17:18.336 --> 17:21.005
Can you hand me that
sledgehammer for a minute?
Why?

17:21.006 --> 17:24.141
See if I can pound your head
back to the normal size.

17:24.142 --> 17:27.477
I'm telling you,
these women really wanted
to get ahold of me.

17:27.478 --> 17:30.480
And a part of me wanted
to get ahold of them.
Borland.

17:30.481 --> 17:32.850
Well, what would you do
if you were single

17:32.851 --> 17:35.185
And all these women were
paying attention to you?

17:35.186 --> 17:37.554
Oh, I'll tell you
what I'd do.
Uh-huh.

17:37.555 --> 17:39.790
Twins?
<i>(laughs)</i>

17:39.791 --> 17:41.792
That's right.
It's becoming clear

17:41.793 --> 17:44.394
That it's a really -
it's a big world out there,

17:44.395 --> 17:47.597
And I shouldn't limit myself
to just ilene.

17:47.598 --> 17:51.101
Boy, I hate to admit it,
but I think jill's right.
About what?

17:51.102 --> 17:53.103
Remember
before ilene came along,

17:53.104 --> 17:56.874
Your black book consisted
of one phone number -
your mom's?

17:58.276 --> 18:00.177
Well, that's all changed now.

18:00.178 --> 18:02.646
Why is it all changed now?
Because of one stupid
magazine article?

18:02.647 --> 18:04.414
No.
Did you really read it?

18:04.415 --> 18:06.516
Did you notice they put
one zero extra on your salary?

18:06.517 --> 18:08.518
They d...

18:09.754 --> 18:11.789
Oh, you carry it around
with you?

18:14.559 --> 18:17.695
Oh, man.

18:17.696 --> 18:21.098
So this is why everybody
was paying attention to me?

18:21.099 --> 18:23.600
No, that's not
the only reason.
Yes. Yes, it is.

18:23.601 --> 18:26.303
No, it's not. They picked you
as most eligible bachelor

18:26.304 --> 18:28.305
Because of a lot
of other reasons.

18:28.306 --> 18:30.908
That's just a typo.
I mean, you are a good
hard-working guy.

18:30.909 --> 18:33.944
You're ha-handsome
in a way, you know.

18:35.780 --> 18:38.248
Hey, if I were
a woman, I...

18:38.249 --> 18:41.318
Tim...
Yeah, you're right.

18:41.319 --> 18:43.320
The point is
there's a woman

18:43.321 --> 18:45.388
That's always
found you sexy,

18:45.389 --> 18:48.425
And she didn't have to
read it in a magazine.

18:48.426 --> 18:50.961
Yeah. And ilene
was the first one

18:50.962 --> 18:54.231
To recognize my understated
sense of humor.

18:54.232 --> 18:56.366
Bingo.

18:56.367 --> 19:00.037
Tim, do you mind
setting up by yourself?

19:01.472 --> 19:04.174
Al, I am setting up
by myself.

19:04.175 --> 19:07.310
I gotta talk to ilene.
I... I've really made a mistake.

19:07.311 --> 19:10.380
Did you get any pictures
of those twins?

19:20.258 --> 19:22.192
Hi.
Is ilene here?

19:22.193 --> 19:24.527
She's tightening some braces.

19:24.528 --> 19:26.596
I'll wait.

19:34.405 --> 19:36.640
See you next week, tiffany.
Bye-bye.

19:36.641 --> 19:38.475
Al!
Hi.

19:38.476 --> 19:40.844
What are you doing here?

19:40.845 --> 19:44.614
I came to apologize
for last night.

19:44.615 --> 19:47.317
You're my girlfriend,

19:47.318 --> 19:51.454
And I never wanted to do
anything to make you upset.

19:51.455 --> 19:53.390
Come on, tiffany.

19:53.391 --> 19:58.295
I know that I've really been
full of myself lately.

19:58.296 --> 19:59.997
Yes, you have.

19:59.998 --> 20:02.966
And it's just that
nothing like this

20:02.967 --> 20:06.937
Has even remotely
ever happened to me
before. I...

20:06.938 --> 20:09.539
I mean, it's... I've never
been popular like this,

20:09.540 --> 20:12.976
And I just didn't know
how to handle it.

20:12.977 --> 20:15.145
So what are you saying, al?

20:17.581 --> 20:19.817
Well, I'm saying that...

20:19.818 --> 20:22.419
Detroit's...

20:22.420 --> 20:24.888
Sexiest bachelor...

20:24.889 --> 20:26.890
Would really like to be

20:26.891 --> 20:29.092
With detroit's
sexiest orthodontist.

20:30.161 --> 20:31.695
Oh, al.

20:37.936 --> 20:40.103
<i>(ringing)</i>

20:46.878 --> 20:48.912
He's unavailable.

20:48.913 --> 20:52.649
Oh, hi, tim. Hold on.
It's for you.

20:52.650 --> 20:55.685
I told you never
to call me here.

20:57.488 --> 21:00.224
I always wanted to say that.

21:02.293 --> 21:04.061
<i>(tim whistles) al.</i>

21:04.062 --> 21:07.130
<i>Al? Could we? Al.</i>

21:07.131 --> 21:08.498
<i>Al.</i>

21:08.499 --> 21:11.701
I'll be right there.
<i>Al! Al.</i>

21:11.702 --> 21:13.237
Tim needs me.

21:22.914 --> 21:24.647
<i>(mouths)</i>

21:26.717 --> 21:30.053
The teacher gave me
a tough one today.
It's about money.

21:30.054 --> 21:32.055
Hmm. What's the problem?

21:32.056 --> 21:34.524
All right, "sam has $8,
billy has nothing."

21:34.525 --> 21:37.094
Wait, wait, wait.
Should use real money.

21:37.095 --> 21:40.330
Eight bucks?
Yeah.

21:40.331 --> 21:43.733
4, 5, 6... Cool.
All right, go ahead.

21:43.734 --> 21:46.569
All right.
I'll be sam. You be billy.

21:46.570 --> 21:49.706
"sam gives billy
50% of what he has."

21:49.707 --> 21:53.277
That's $4.
1, 2, 3, 4.

21:53.278 --> 21:54.978
Thanks, sam.
All right.

21:54.979 --> 21:58.515
"now billy gives sam
50% of what he has."

21:58.516 --> 22:00.784
That's 2 out of the 4.
Ok. 1, 2.

22:00.785 --> 22:03.720
That's pretty simple. Ok.
All right.

22:03.721 --> 22:08.058
"now, if sam gives billy
100% of what he has left...

22:09.794 --> 22:11.494
All right.

22:11.495 --> 22:13.463
...How much does sam have?"

22:13.464 --> 22:15.465
Nothing.

22:15.466 --> 22:18.535
Exactly. Thanks, sam.

22:22.974 --> 22:25.943
Sam wasn't a real bright guy,
was he?

22:30.381 --> 22:33.350
I'm partial to women
with all kinds of doors.

22:33.351 --> 22:35.685
Dutch doors,
sliding glass doors...

22:38.256 --> 22:39.923
Well, I think we've...

22:39.924 --> 22:42.826
Garage doors. Back doors.
Garage doors. Back doors.

22:42.827 --> 22:43.893
Well, let's finish up...

22:43.894 --> 22:45.728
Side doors...
Side doors. That's good.

22:45.729 --> 22:48.865
Well, actually
I like bay or louvered.
