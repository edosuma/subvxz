WEBVTT

00:06.677 --> 00:10.181
YES! THE COUCH
IS FINALLY CLEAN.

00:10.181 --> 00:13.724
FAMILY, I HAVE
A SURPRISE.

00:14.845 --> 00:17.308
SO, WHAT LOOKS DIFFERENT?

00:17.308 --> 00:18.939
LET'S SEE.

00:18.939 --> 00:20.731
YOUR MAKEUP IS RUNNING
AND YOUR HAIR'S ALL WET.

00:20.731 --> 00:23.814
WAIT, IS THAT A NEW LOOK?
IT IS BEAUTIFUL.

00:23.814 --> 00:26.567
WHY WOULD YOU THINK
THIS IS A NEW LOOK?

00:26.567 --> 00:28.819
BECAUSE I LAUGHED OUT LOUD
WHEN YOU WORE THAT BLUE LIPSTICK

00:28.819 --> 00:31.742
AND I AM NOT MAKING
THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

00:31.742 --> 00:33.614
NO, THIS IS
FROM THE STEAM,

00:33.614 --> 00:35.536
AND THAT'S A HINT.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.958
YOU WALKED THROUGH
A CAR WASH ON A DARE?

00:37.958 --> 00:40.331
I'VE DONE THAT.

00:40.331 --> 00:42.042
YOU WERE STEAMING UP
THE BATHROOM

00:42.042 --> 00:43.334
TO GET YOUR FINGERS PRUNE-Y

00:43.334 --> 00:45.756
SO YOU CAN HAVE
GRANDMA HANDS.

00:45.756 --> 00:48.129
I'VE DONE THAT.

00:48.129 --> 00:49.720
YOU WERE
STEAMING VEGETABLES

00:49.720 --> 00:52.133
FOR A HEALTHY SNACK.
I'VE DONE THAT.

00:52.133 --> 00:55.676
SORRY, I DON'T DO
STUPID THINGS WITH STEAM.

00:55.676 --> 00:59.600
NO. THE COUCH IS CLEAN.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.681
Stan: THE COUCH.

01:00.681 --> 01:02.273
5'6", 120 POUNDS,

01:02.273 --> 01:03.984
THROWS RIGHT, BATS LEFT.

01:03.984 --> 01:06.447
I'M JUST KIDDING.
IT'S A COUCH.

01:06.447 --> 01:09.069
COME ON, LOOK
HOW CLEAN IT IS.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.821
WE FINALLY HAVE
OUR COUCH BACK.

01:10.821 --> 01:12.783
AND TO KEEP IT
SPARKLING CLEAN,

01:12.783 --> 01:14.535
WE'RE GOING TO ENFORCE
A FAMILY RULE

01:14.535 --> 01:16.537
WE'VE BEEN A BIT LAX ABOUT.

01:16.537 --> 01:18.579
NO DOGS ON THE COUCH.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.332
NO, NOT THE COUCH.
THAT'S MY SPOT.

01:21.332 --> 01:23.204
THIS WILL NOT STAND.

01:23.204 --> 01:25.336
AH, THIS NEWLY
CLEANED COUCH

01:25.336 --> 01:28.839
IS LIKE A BIG,
STEAMY LOVE DUMPLING.

01:28.839 --> 01:31.172
AVERY, GET STAN
OFF THE COUCH.

01:31.172 --> 01:33.634
WHAT? NO, NO.
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.

01:33.634 --> 01:37.348
I KNOW MY RIGHTS.
IS SOMEBODY RECORDING THIS?

01:37.348 --> 01:39.720
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE
GONNA TRY TO KEEP ME
OFF THE COUCH.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.852
WHAT HAVE I EVER DONE
ON THAT COUCH

01:41.852 --> 01:43.564
THAT JUSTIFIES THIS?

01:43.564 --> 01:45.396
OKAY, SWEETHEART,
START JUMPING,

01:45.396 --> 01:47.568
AND I'LL MEET YOU
IN THE MIDDLE.

02:06.667 --> 02:09.800
STAN, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
ON THE COUCH.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.882
THIS IS WHERE
YOU CAN BE.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.714
GET IN YOUR NEW
DOG BED.

02:13.714 --> 02:16.347
LET'S SEE. A SMALLER,
LUMPIER, CHEAPER VERSION

02:16.347 --> 02:17.638
OF WHAT I'M
SITTING ON NOW.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.430
YEAH, THAT'LL WOO ME.

02:19.430 --> 02:21.932
KIDS, GET IN HERE.

02:21.932 --> 02:24.064
YOUR DOG
IS ON THE COUCH.

02:24.064 --> 02:26.227
I'VE TRIED,
AND I'VE HAD IT.

02:26.227 --> 02:27.728
EITHER GET STAN TO
STAY OFF THE FURNITURE,

02:27.728 --> 02:30.441
OR I'M HIRING
A PROFESSIONAL DOG TRAINER.

02:30.441 --> 02:32.653
AND THIS TIME,
I'M GONNA FOLLOW THROUGH.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.695
NOT LIKE THAT FINNISH
TRAINER I HIRED FOR MYSELF.

02:34.695 --> 02:36.737
THAT WOMAN KEPT
YELLING AT ME,

02:36.737 --> 02:38.619
AND THOSE WEIGHTS
WERE HEAVY.

02:38.619 --> 02:41.121
STAN, WHY ARE YOU
BEING SO STUBBORN?

02:41.121 --> 02:42.703
WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST LIE SOMEWHERE ELSE?

02:42.703 --> 02:44.835
'CAUSE THE COUCH
MUFFLES MY FARTS.

02:44.835 --> 02:46.287
ISN'T THAT WHY WE ALL
SIT ON THE COUCH?

02:46.287 --> 02:47.628
- YES.
- NO.

02:47.628 --> 02:49.500
- YES?
- NO.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.672
YOU'RE DOING IT
RIGHT NOW, AREN'T YOU?

02:51.672 --> 02:53.133
Both: YES.

02:55.466 --> 02:58.429
LOOK, STAN, DOG TRAINING
WON'T BE FUN FOR YOU.

02:58.429 --> 02:59.800
IF THEY THINK
I'M TRAINABLE,

02:59.800 --> 03:01.262
THEY HAVE
ANOTHER THINK COMING.

03:01.262 --> 03:02.643
PROFESSIONAL TRAINERS
AREN'T PUSHOVERS

03:02.643 --> 03:04.605
LIKE MOM AND DAD.

03:04.605 --> 03:05.976
THEY DO THIS
FOR A LIVING.

03:05.976 --> 03:08.569
AND I SIT ON COUCHES
FOR A LIVING.

03:08.569 --> 03:10.691
THE PAY'S NOT GREAT,
BUT THE HOURS ARE FANTASTIC,

03:10.691 --> 03:12.443
AND I DON'T
HAVE TO WEAR PANTS.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.779
HI, YOU MUST BE
THE DOG TRAINER.
COME ON IN.

03:18.779 --> 03:19.990
WELCOME TO OUR HOUSE.

03:19.990 --> 03:22.162
WHEN I'M HERE,
THIS IS MY HOUSE.

03:22.162 --> 03:24.535
NOW SOMEONE GET ME
ONE OF MY SODAS

03:24.535 --> 03:26.086
OUT OF MY FRIDGE.

03:26.086 --> 03:28.208
I'M SORRY, WE ONLY KEEP
HEALTHY BEVERAGES IN...

03:28.208 --> 03:30.170
YOUR FRIDGE.

03:30.170 --> 03:32.293
HEALTHY BEVERAGES?

03:32.293 --> 03:33.924
STRIKE ONE.

03:35.426 --> 03:37.718
IS THAT YOUR DOG?

03:37.718 --> 03:39.720
YES. I MEAN,
NO, IT'S YOUR DOG.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.723
I MEAN...
WHAT'S THE ANSWER?

03:42.723 --> 03:43.934
HIS NAME IS STAN.

03:43.934 --> 03:46.307
YOU GAVE YOUR DOG
A PERSON NAME?

03:46.307 --> 03:49.109
STRIKE TWO!

03:49.109 --> 03:52.152
I ASSUME HE KNOWS
THE BASIC COMMANDS.

03:52.152 --> 03:54.154
STAN, SIT.

03:55.776 --> 03:59.700
( laughing )

03:59.700 --> 04:01.862
I KNOW WHY
I'M LAUGHING.

04:01.862 --> 04:04.665
BECAUSE YOUR INCOMPETENCE
AMUSES ME.

04:04.665 --> 04:06.287
BUT WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

04:06.287 --> 04:08.289
WE'VE STOPPED.

04:10.421 --> 04:13.213
DADDY, I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THE MONSTER UNDER MY BED
WASN'T REAL.

04:13.213 --> 04:15.376
I DIDN'T KNOW.

04:15.376 --> 04:17.838
WHY ARE WE LETTING
HER TRAIN STAN?

04:17.838 --> 04:20.090
BECAUSE SHE'S THE BEST
IN THE BUSINESS.

04:20.090 --> 04:22.303
SHE MAY BE MEAN,
BUT SHE'S NOT HERE
TO BE OUR FRIEND.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.974
SHE'S HERE TO TRAIN STAN.

04:23.974 --> 04:26.647
WHY IS EVERYONE
LOOKING AT ME?

04:26.647 --> 04:30.811
BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING
IN FRONT OF ME AS IF
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

04:30.811 --> 04:32.773
I WASN'T SAYING
FRIENDSHIP WAS OFF LIMITS.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.656
WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD HAPPEN?

04:35.656 --> 04:37.818
SHERRY, AS A PSYCHOLOGIST,

04:37.818 --> 04:39.740
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU USE
ANY OF THE TRADITIONAL

04:39.740 --> 04:41.822
BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION TOOLS.

04:41.822 --> 04:43.073
YOU MEAN LIKE
A SPRAY BOTTLE?

04:43.073 --> 04:44.785
YEAH, SOMETHING
YOU MIGHT FIND

04:44.785 --> 04:45.996
A LITTLE LESS...

04:47.287 --> 04:49.460
DON'T INTERRUPT.

04:49.460 --> 04:51.832
I KNOW.
HE DOES THAT.

04:51.832 --> 04:54.585
I TELL HIM, BENNETT,
DON'T INTERRUPT...

04:54.585 --> 04:57.087
DON'T INTERRUPT.

04:57.087 --> 04:59.880
I HAVE WORKED WITH
OVER 1,000 DOGS
IN MY CAREER,

04:59.880 --> 05:01.882
AND DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY
I'VE FAILED TO TRAIN?

05:01.882 --> 05:04.094
ZERO.

05:04.094 --> 05:06.847
I WAS GONNA SAY ZERO,
BECAUSE I READ THAT
ON YOUR WEBSITE,

05:06.847 --> 05:09.560
BUT I DIDN'T WANNA
INTERRUPT, BECAUSE YOU
SAID DON'T INTERRUPT.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.603
PLEASE DON'T SPRAY ME.
PLEASE.

05:12.603 --> 05:15.606
I SEE YOU PEOPLE ARE
GONNA BE AN IMPEDIMENT
TO HIS TRAINING,

05:15.606 --> 05:17.648
SO HOW DO I SAY
THIS NICELY?

05:17.648 --> 05:20.991
STRIKE THREE,
GET OUTTA HERE, LOSERS!

05:20.991 --> 05:24.575
HOW WOULD YOU SAY THAT
NOT NICELY?

05:24.575 --> 05:27.948
( growling )
GET OUT!

05:29.540 --> 05:30.831
I DID ASK.

05:32.663 --> 05:34.755
NOW, LET'S GET YOU
OFF THAT SOFA.

05:34.755 --> 05:36.757
STAN, OFF.

05:38.839 --> 05:42.383
OH, SO THAT'S HOW
IT'S GONNA BE.

05:42.383 --> 05:44.925
GUESS I'LL JUST
PULL YOU OFF
THAT COUCH.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.730
WHAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW
IS I HAVE SPENT YEARS

05:49.730 --> 05:51.602
MASTERING
THE ANCIENT DISCIPLINE

05:51.602 --> 05:54.685
OF WATCHING KUNG FU MOVIES
ON TV.

05:54.685 --> 05:57.478
DID YOU JUST...

05:57.478 --> 06:00.691
NO. LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

06:02.192 --> 06:03.784
YOU WANNA
TUSSLE?

06:31.011 --> 06:32.813
YOUR KUNG FU
IS IMPRESSIVE,

06:32.813 --> 06:36.817
BUT IT'S NO MATCH FOR
MY SHIH TZU JIU JITSU.

06:48.118 --> 06:50.991
I HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO GET YOUR ATTENTION
FOR AN HOUR.

06:50.991 --> 06:54.795
HUH. I'VE BEEN FANTASIZING
ABOUT KUNG FU FOR AN HOUR?

06:54.795 --> 06:57.167
THAT'S LESS TIME
THAN USUAL.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.169
YOU JUST SIT THERE,

06:59.169 --> 07:01.802
STARING OFF
INTO SPACE.

07:01.802 --> 07:05.636
AT THE RISK OF GETTING
DEMON-YELLED AT,

07:05.636 --> 07:07.427
HOW'S IT GOIN'
IN HERE?

07:07.427 --> 07:10.931
HE'S STILL ON OUR...
YOUR COUCH.

07:10.931 --> 07:14.224
NO, I THINK
IT'S HIS COUCH.

07:14.224 --> 07:16.727
I TRIED EVERY TECHNIQUE
I KNOW,

07:16.727 --> 07:19.109
AND YOUR DOG
IS UNTRAINABLE.

07:19.109 --> 07:22.272
I FAILED.
I'VE NEVER FAILED BEFORE.

07:22.272 --> 07:25.065
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
UPDATE MY WEBSITE,

07:25.065 --> 07:27.488
AND MY LETTERHEAD
AND MY PAJAMAS.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.409
THAT'S RIGHT, IT SAYS
ZERO FAILURES

07:29.409 --> 07:32.663
ON MY PAJAMAS,
ON EVERY SINGLE PAIR.

07:33.994 --> 07:37.127
( crying )

07:37.127 --> 07:39.459
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.132
WE GAVE IT OUR BEST SHOT
TO KEEP HIM OFF THE COUCH,

07:42.132 --> 07:43.924
BUT A PROFESSIONAL
DOG TRAINER

07:43.924 --> 07:45.425
JUST TOLD US
THAT STAN IS UNTRAINABLE.

07:45.425 --> 07:47.928
SO FROM NOW ON,
STAN IS GONNA BE...

07:47.928 --> 07:50.851
- ALLOWED ON THE COUCH.
- AN OUTSIDE DOG.

07:50.851 --> 07:52.763
WAIT. THAT IS
MARKEDLY DIFFERENT

07:52.763 --> 07:54.765
FROM WHAT I JUST SAID.

07:59.690 --> 08:00.901
THIS IS SO SAD.

08:00.901 --> 08:02.733
I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT HIM.

08:05.816 --> 08:08.609
MOM, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

08:08.609 --> 08:09.780
STAN IS AN INSIDE DOG.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.111
HE IS UNTRAINABLE.

08:11.111 --> 08:12.412
SO'S TYLER,

08:12.412 --> 08:14.575
BUT NO ONE
PUTS HIM OUTSIDE.

08:14.575 --> 08:16.166
ACTUALLY, YESTERDAY
AT SCHOOL,

08:16.166 --> 08:18.919
- MRS. CROWLEY...
- YOU'RE NOT HELPING.

08:18.919 --> 08:20.791
HONEY, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT--

08:20.791 --> 08:22.793
YES, WE ARE.

08:22.793 --> 08:23.674
WE'RE A UNITED FRONT.

08:23.674 --> 08:25.085
WHEN DID WE DECIDE--

08:25.085 --> 08:26.627
WHEN TWO PEOPLE
GET MARRIED,

08:26.627 --> 08:28.298
THERE'S AN IMPLICIT
AGREEMENT

08:28.298 --> 08:29.680
THAT YOU'LL SUPPORT
EACH OTHER IN ANYTHING.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.722
THE FIRST PERSON WHO SPEAKS
GETS TO MAKE THE RULES.

08:31.722 --> 08:33.433
WHY DO YOU THINK I MARRIED
SUCH A SLOW-TALKING MAN?

08:33.433 --> 08:36.436
FINE. WE'RE A UNITED FRONT.

08:37.688 --> 08:39.399
STAN, ARE YOU OKAY?

08:39.399 --> 08:41.732
BEING OUT HERE
DOES THINGS TO YOUR SOUL.

08:41.732 --> 08:44.144
DARK AND HORRIBLE THINGS.

08:44.144 --> 08:46.236
YOU'VE ONLY BEEN
OUT HERE TWO MINUTES.

08:46.236 --> 08:49.740
YOU LOSE TRACK OF TIME
UP RIVER.

08:49.740 --> 08:51.702
STAN, WHY ARE YOU
ACTING SO CRAZY?

08:51.702 --> 08:53.704
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
STAY OFF THE COUCH

08:53.704 --> 08:55.656
SO MOM WILL LET YOU
COME BACK INSIDE?

08:55.656 --> 08:58.789
AVERY, I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK
IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.210
I CAN'T EAT AT THE TABLE.

09:00.210 --> 09:02.502
I CAN'T ENTER ANY TV
SINGING COMPETITIONS,

09:02.502 --> 09:04.795
AND THERE ARE
SO MANY OF THEM.

09:06.086 --> 09:08.839
I FEEL LIKE
A SECOND-CLASS CITIZEN.

09:08.839 --> 09:11.471
WHEN I WAS ON THAT COUCH,
I WASN'T A DOG.

09:11.471 --> 09:13.383
I WAS ONE OF YOU.

09:13.383 --> 09:17.097
PLEASE, JUST...
DON'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME.

09:17.097 --> 09:19.179
WOW.

09:19.179 --> 09:22.392
STAN, I DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW MUCH IT MEANT TO YOU.

09:22.392 --> 09:24.104
OF COURSE
YOU'RE ONE OF US.

09:24.104 --> 09:25.776
HOW CAN I BE?

09:25.776 --> 09:27.688
I'M NOT EVEN
ALLOWED IN THE HOUSE.

09:27.688 --> 09:30.280
AND SOMEONE KEEPS DELETING
MY PROGRAMS FROM THE DVR.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.903
CELEBRITIES ARE GOING OUT OF
THEIR COMFORT ZONE, AVERY,

09:32.903 --> 09:35.826
AND I AM MISSING IT.

09:35.826 --> 09:38.829
I PROMISE THAT WE
WILL GET YOU BACK
IN THE HOUSE, STAN.

09:38.829 --> 09:41.041
IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:41.041 --> 09:43.503
MAYBE WE SHOULD
ALL LIVE OUTSIDE

09:43.503 --> 09:45.585
IN SOLIDARITY
WITH STAN.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.668
THAT WILL SHOW MOM AND DAD
HOW UNFAIR THIS IS.

09:47.668 --> 09:49.760
- OKAY, KIDS, LUNCH.
- NO WAY, MOM.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.052
WE'RE TAKING A STAND.

09:52.052 --> 09:53.674
WE'RE NOT GOING INSIDE
UNTIL STAN'S ALLOWED
BACK IN THE HOUSE.

09:53.674 --> 09:55.846
SO COULD YOU BRING
MY LUNCH OUT HERE,

09:55.846 --> 09:58.178
AND USE THE RAISINS
TO MAKE A SMILEY FACE
IN THE PEANUT BUTTER?

09:58.178 --> 10:01.431
THE KIDS THINK THEY'RE
GOING TO LIVE OUTSIDE

10:01.431 --> 10:04.855
IN PROTEST UNTIL WE LET
STAN BE AN INSIDE DOG AGAIN.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.687
WELL, WHEN YOU KIDS
LEARN THAT YOU'RE WRONG,

10:06.687 --> 10:08.819
YOU'LL JUST
COME BACK INSIDE.

10:08.819 --> 10:11.031
OR WE COULD JUST TELL YOU
TO COME INSIDE RIGHT NOW.

10:11.031 --> 10:12.863
SO I'M A UNITED FRONT
WITH YOU,

10:12.863 --> 10:14.865
BUT YOU'RE NOT
A UNITED FRONT WITH ME?

10:14.865 --> 10:17.658
KIDS, I SUPPORT
YOUR FATHER'S RIDICULOUS IDEA

10:17.658 --> 10:19.830
THAT YOU'LL LEARN THAT
YOU'RE WRONG ON YOUR OWN.

10:19.830 --> 10:21.451
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

10:23.083 --> 10:25.205
THANKS FOR DOING THIS
FOR ME, GUYS.

10:25.205 --> 10:26.747
OF COURSE, STAN.

10:26.747 --> 10:28.208
YOU KNOW WE'D DO
ANYTHING FOR YOU.

10:28.208 --> 10:30.510
WELL, WELCOME TO
MY YARD.

10:30.510 --> 10:32.212
THERE'S A FEW THINGS
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

10:32.212 --> 10:33.593
OVER THERE
IS WHERE I PEE,

10:33.593 --> 10:35.846
OVER THERE IS WHERE
I BURY MY BONES,

10:35.846 --> 10:37.808
AND THIS IS WHERE
I DRAW CARICATURES.

10:39.429 --> 10:41.812
YOU LIKE TO WATER SKI, RIGHT?

10:43.023 --> 10:44.685
I DON'T LIKE
THIS, BENNETT.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.396
IT FEELS LIKE THEY'RE
GETTING AWAY WITH SOMETHING.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.647
I THINK WE SHOULD
GO OUT THERE

10:47.647 --> 10:49.730
AND TELL THEM TO
COME BACK INSIDE.

10:49.730 --> 10:51.822
NO, WE CAN'T.
THEY'VE ONLY BEEN
OUT THERE A FEW HOURS.

10:51.822 --> 10:55.195
SOON ENOUGH, THEY'LL
GET UNCOMFORTABLE
AND COME IN.

10:55.195 --> 10:57.698
IT'S ALL IN MY BOOK
OF MAGICAL PARENTING TIPS,

10:57.698 --> 10:59.369
ABRACADADDY.

10:59.369 --> 11:00.831
TA-DA!

11:02.202 --> 11:04.705
WELL, THE KIDS DON'T
LOOK UNCOMFORTABLE.

11:04.705 --> 11:07.788
OH, THEY'RE ABOUT TO
BECOME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

11:07.788 --> 11:10.711
THEY LEFT SOMETHING INSIDE
THAT THEY CANNOT
LIVE WITHOUT.

11:10.711 --> 11:13.754
THEIR CELL PHONE CHARGERS.

11:13.754 --> 11:16.096
TA-DA!

11:16.096 --> 11:17.718
WHO'S YOUR
ABRACADADDY NOW?

11:19.559 --> 11:22.062
I'VE ONLY GOT
TWO PERCENT POWER LEFT.

11:22.062 --> 11:25.145
WHAT DO I SPEND IT ON?
WAIT, I KNOW.

11:25.145 --> 11:26.937
SELFIE.

11:26.937 --> 11:29.689
I'M GONNA POST THAT
ON BUDDYBOP.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.112
Phone voice, distorted:
BUDDY...BOP.

11:32.112 --> 11:33.774
NO!

11:33.774 --> 11:36.907
HA! THAT IS WHAT YOU GET
FOR WATCHING VIDEOS ALL DAY.

11:36.907 --> 11:38.739
I HAVE BEEN
SAVING MY POWER.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.280
I HAVE 40% LEFT.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.621
YEAH, ABOUT THAT.

11:41.621 --> 11:43.744
I'VE BEEN USING YOUR PHONE
TO CHECK OUT

11:43.744 --> 11:46.376
ALL THE SELFIES
TYLER POSTED ON BUDDYBOP.

11:46.376 --> 11:48.789
THERE'S SOME REAL
GOOD ONES THERE, GUY.

11:50.040 --> 11:51.291
YOU'RE AT
TWO PERCENT.

11:51.291 --> 11:53.253
( gasps )

11:53.253 --> 11:55.505
SELFIE.

11:55.505 --> 11:57.097
( distorted )
BUDDY... BOP.

11:57.097 --> 11:59.139
WORTH IT.

11:59.139 --> 12:01.721
NOW HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO TEXT MY FRIENDS?

12:01.721 --> 12:03.723
IF YOU WANNA
TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS,

12:03.723 --> 12:06.186
YOU HAVE TO WAIT
TO SEE THEM AT SCHOOL.

12:06.186 --> 12:08.268
WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE.

12:08.268 --> 12:09.810
WHY DID WE JUST
WALK OUT HERE

12:09.810 --> 12:11.812
WITH WHAT WE HAD
ON US?

12:11.812 --> 12:13.233
WE SHOULD'VE TAKEN
OUR STUFF WITH US.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.156
CLOTHES, CELL PHONE
CHARGERS, BODY SPRAY,

12:16.156 --> 12:17.988
BODY WASH,
BODY BUTTER.

12:17.988 --> 12:20.450
AND THAT'S JUST
THE NECK-DOWN STUFF.

12:20.450 --> 12:23.623
THIS IS WHERE
THE REAL INVESTMENT IS.

12:23.623 --> 12:25.415
I SHOULD'VE BROUGHT
MY NEW BOOK CALLED

12:25.415 --> 12:27.707
ROCK STAR RABBIT
LOSES HIS GUITAR.

12:27.707 --> 12:29.920
WILL HE FIND IT?
IF HE DOESN'T FIND IT,

12:29.920 --> 12:31.962
WILL HE STILL
BE A ROCK STAR?

12:31.962 --> 12:34.965
BOY, THEIR TITLES
REALLY GRAB YOU
AND DON'T LET GO.

12:34.965 --> 12:37.587
ALL RIGHT,
WE BROUGHT YOU

12:37.587 --> 12:41.141
- A FEW OF THE ESSENTIALS
YOU'LL NEED TO SURVIVE.
- OH, CELL PHONE CHARGERS?

12:41.141 --> 12:44.384
NO, SLEEPING BAGS
SO YOU WON'T FREEZE,

12:44.384 --> 12:46.807
AND BREAKFAST BARS
SO YOU WON'T STARVE.

12:46.807 --> 12:51.852
DON'T SAY ESSENTIALS
IF YOU DON'T MEAN ESSENTIALS.

12:51.852 --> 12:53.653
I'M STARVING
FOR INFORMATION,

12:53.653 --> 12:56.486
AND I'M FREEZED OUT OF
SOCIAL INTERACTION.

12:56.486 --> 12:59.489
FINE. DON'T GIVE ME
MY CELL PHONE CHARGER.

12:59.489 --> 13:01.161
JUST TELL ME WHAT
PEOPLE ARE SAYING
ABOUT MY SELFIES.

13:01.161 --> 13:02.612
JUST TELL ME.

13:02.612 --> 13:05.285
CELL PHONE CHARGERS
ARE INSIDE,

13:05.285 --> 13:08.288
RIGHT NEXT TO THE NEW
ROCK STAR RABBIT BOOK.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.620
JUST HAVE TO REALIZE
YOU'RE WRONG AND COME INSIDE.

13:10.620 --> 13:13.213
NO. WE'RE DOING THIS
FOR STAN.

13:13.213 --> 13:15.715
YEAH, WE'RE NOT
COMING INSIDE

13:15.715 --> 13:18.418
UNTIL YOU LET
HIM COME INSIDE.

13:18.418 --> 13:20.220
OKAY, BUT I HOPE
YOU REALIZE

13:20.220 --> 13:22.222
ROCK STAR RABBIT
MAY OR MAY NOT

13:22.222 --> 13:23.723
FIND HIS GUITAR.

13:23.723 --> 13:25.765
NOT MY PROBLEM.

13:25.765 --> 13:29.769
WALK AWAY.
WALK AWAY.

13:34.144 --> 13:35.645
THEY SPENT THE WHOLE
NIGHT OUT THERE.

13:35.645 --> 13:37.647
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THEY'D CRACK BY NOW.

13:37.647 --> 13:40.700
THEY'RE GONNA CRACK.
IT'S JUST TAKING
LONGER THAN I THOUGHT.

13:40.700 --> 13:42.822
I DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY
TO FIGHT WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.075
- I WAS UP ALL NIGHT.
- WORRYING ABOUT THE KIDS?

13:45.075 --> 13:48.078
NO, READING ROCK STAR RABBIT
LOSES HIS GUITAR.

13:48.078 --> 13:50.790
THAT TITLE REALLY GRABS YOU
AND DOESN'T LET GO.

13:50.790 --> 13:53.623
WELL, I WAS DOWN HERE
ALL NIGHT

13:53.623 --> 13:55.005
SO I COULD
BE NEAR THE KIDS.

13:55.005 --> 13:56.796
I SLEPT WITH MY HEAD
ON THE KITCHEN TABLE.

13:56.796 --> 13:58.668
I HAVE A CRICK IN MY NECK,
BENNETT, A CRICK.

13:58.668 --> 14:00.340
I CAN DO THIS,
BUT NOT THIS.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.762
OW! OKAY, I CAN DO IT,
BUT... OW!

14:02.762 --> 14:04.634
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

14:04.634 --> 14:06.806
I'M GOING TO TELL THE KIDS
THEY'RE COMING INSIDE.

14:06.806 --> 14:09.429
NO! WE ARE
A UNITED FRONT.

14:09.429 --> 14:11.641
IF YOU'RE GONNA
SAY THAT TO ME,
STAND OVER HERE,

14:11.641 --> 14:14.144
BECAUSE I CAN'T
TURN MY HEAD, AND
I WANNA SCOWL AT YOU.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.026
( growls softly )

14:18.899 --> 14:21.191
( yells )

14:21.191 --> 14:23.743
OH, IT'S NOT
JUST A DREAM.

14:23.743 --> 14:25.825
I REALLY AM OUTSIDE.

14:25.825 --> 14:27.948
AH, THE BOUNCE IS GONE.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.082
I WAS VISITED IN THE NIGHT
BY A POSSUM.

14:32.082 --> 14:33.873
I WAS AFRAID OF IT,
SO I PLAYED DEAD.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.166
THEN HE PLAYED DEAD.
IT WAS A STANDOFF.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.757
UNTIL THIS MORNING,
WHEN I REALIZED

14:37.757 --> 14:39.709
HE'D ACTUALLY DIED.

14:39.709 --> 14:42.172
I COULD'VE BEEN SLEEPING
THE WHOLE TIME.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.504
THE POINT IS,
THIS ISN'T EASY FOR ANY OF US,

14:44.504 --> 14:46.716
BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER
WHY WE'RE DOING THIS--

14:46.716 --> 14:48.308
FOR STAN.

14:48.308 --> 14:51.641
WE CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS.
LOOK AT US, WE'RE A MESS.

14:53.773 --> 14:56.566
YOU LIKE TO
RIDE BIKES, RIGHT?

14:56.566 --> 14:58.358
I'M SORRY, STAN.
WE TRIED.

14:58.358 --> 15:00.360
OH, SO YOU'RE LEAVING ME?

15:00.360 --> 15:02.022
I KNEW YOU WOULD,
YOU DIRTY...

15:02.022 --> 15:03.613
STAN, NO ONE IS LEAVING YOU.

15:03.613 --> 15:07.197
...HAIRED ANGEL.
YOU DIRTY-HAIRED ANGEL.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.788
MY HAIR IS DIRTY.

15:08.788 --> 15:10.790
I'M SORRY, HAIR,
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SUFFER.

15:10.790 --> 15:12.662
YOU DIDN'T SIGN UP
FOR THIS.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.624
- TYLER, IS YOUR
HEART BEATING?
- YES.

15:14.624 --> 15:16.166
- ARE YOU BREATHING?
- YES.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.707
THEN CORK IT!

15:19.709 --> 15:21.421
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M WITH YOU GUYS.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.752
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

15:22.752 --> 15:24.214
( hair dryer blowing )

15:24.214 --> 15:26.096
WHAT IS THAT SOUND?

15:26.096 --> 15:28.008
WHAT IS
THAT BEAUTIFUL SOUND?

15:28.008 --> 15:30.600
NEW HAIR DRYER.
WANNA TRY IT?

15:34.224 --> 15:36.646
THAT DOESN'T LOOK
STREET LEGAL.

15:36.646 --> 15:38.608
IT'S BEEN MODIFIED.

15:38.608 --> 15:40.820
WALK AWAY.
WALK AWAY.

15:42.192 --> 15:43.483
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

15:43.483 --> 15:44.654
OUR ALLIANCE IS CRACKING.

15:44.654 --> 15:46.656
BY ALLIANCE,
I MEAN TYLER.

15:46.656 --> 15:48.488
YOU LADIES
ARE HOLDIN' UP GREAT.

15:48.488 --> 15:51.661
WE NEED TO PUT
SOME PRESSURE
ON MOM AND DAD

15:51.661 --> 15:53.663
SO THAT THEY
CRACK FIRST,

15:53.663 --> 15:55.165
OR YOU'LL NEVER BE
AN INSIDE DOG.

15:55.165 --> 15:58.628
WAIT, WHAT IF WE
MAKE OURSELVES REALLY DIRTY

15:58.628 --> 16:00.710
AND DISHEVELED
AND EMBARRASS MOM AND DAD

16:00.710 --> 16:02.292
IN FRONT OF
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD?

16:02.292 --> 16:04.754
STOP CANINE OPPRESSION.

16:04.754 --> 16:06.676
DOGS ARE PEOPLE, TOO.

16:06.676 --> 16:08.848
NO JUSTICE,
NO SELFIES.

16:08.848 --> 16:12.142
STAN, HOW IS SELLING
YOUR CARICATURES HELPING?

16:12.142 --> 16:13.893
JUST KEEPING
MORALE UP.

16:13.893 --> 16:17.557
I MADE THIS FOR YOU.

16:17.557 --> 16:19.689
YOU LIKE TO PROTEST, RIGHT?

16:24.904 --> 16:26.526
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE KIDS ARE DOING THIS.

16:26.526 --> 16:28.738
I KNOW, I KNOW.
THEY'VE GONE TOO FAR.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.610
STOP CANINE OPPRESSION.

16:30.610 --> 16:33.283
HEY, HEY, HEY.
WILL YOU KIDS
KEEP IT DOWN OVER HERE?

16:33.283 --> 16:36.456
I'M TRYING TO PUT
A SHIP INTO A BOTTLE.

16:36.456 --> 16:37.917
HEY, MR. TRUMMER.

16:37.917 --> 16:40.170
WE'RE PROTESTING
MY PARENTS BEING MEAN.

16:40.170 --> 16:42.582
OH, GLAD YOU CUT
YOUR HAIR, SALLY.

16:42.582 --> 16:44.714
THEN WHY ARE YOU STILL
CALLING ME SALLY?

16:44.714 --> 16:47.337
ALL THE GIRLS ARE
WEARING IT SHORT THIS YEAR.

16:47.337 --> 16:49.799
HEY, BERNADETTE PETERS.

16:49.799 --> 16:53.633
STILL ONLY FUNNY TO YOU.

16:53.633 --> 16:57.187
MR. TRUMMER, OUR PARENTS
MADE STAN AN OUTSIDE DOG.

16:57.187 --> 16:59.769
WILL YOU SIGN OUR PETITION
AGAINST THIS ACT OF TYRANNY?

16:59.769 --> 17:01.691
I KNOW THE SCHOOLS
AIN'T WHAT THEY USED TO BE,

17:01.691 --> 17:05.235
BUT YOU DO UNDERSTAND
WHAT A DOG IS, RIGHT?

17:05.235 --> 17:07.277
YOU DO UNDERSTAND THAT,
IN MY IMAGINATION,

17:07.277 --> 17:10.650
I'M A KUNG FU MASTER, RIGHT?

17:10.650 --> 17:12.782
DON'T COME LOOKIN' TO ME
FOR SUPPORT.

17:12.782 --> 17:14.654
I THINK YOUR PARENTS
ARE RIGHT.

17:14.654 --> 17:16.746
COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT
AS PARENTS, BUT RIGHT.

17:20.710 --> 17:24.043
HEY, YOU WANT ME
TO RAISE 'EM FOR YOU
WHILE I'M OUT HERE?

17:24.043 --> 17:27.167
MR. TRUMMER, HELLO.

17:27.167 --> 17:29.339
DO YOU SEE WHAT'S
HAPPENING HERE, BENNETT?

17:29.339 --> 17:30.930
THE NEIGHBORS ARE NOTICING.
IT'S MAKING US LOOK BAD AND...

17:30.930 --> 17:32.972
GET OUT OF THAT THING.

17:32.972 --> 17:35.135
I WAS JUST CHECKING IT
TO MAKE SURE

17:35.135 --> 17:37.267
WE WEREN'T BEING
UNREASONABLE.

17:37.267 --> 17:39.809
IT IS A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE
THAN YOU THINK.

17:41.481 --> 17:43.733
WELL, SINCE YOU CAN'T
CONTROL YOUR OWN KIDS,

17:43.733 --> 17:46.566
I'LL SEE IF I CAN
CRANK UP MY LAWN JET SPRINKLER

17:46.566 --> 17:48.188
AND HOSE 'EM DOWN
FOR YOU.

17:48.188 --> 17:51.070
THAT WON'T BE
NECESSARY, MR. TRUMMER.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.072
NEITHER IS PUTTING
ALL MY JUNK MAIL

17:53.072 --> 17:56.366
IN YOUR MAILBOX,
BUT I STILL DO IT.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.199
I HAVE HAD IT
WITH THE KIDS.

17:59.199 --> 18:00.830
WE'RE JUST GONNA
TELL THEM THEY
HAVE TO COME IN.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.542
I DON'T CARE IF YOU THINK
THEY'LL LEARN THE LESSON

18:02.542 --> 18:03.833
BETTER BY FIGURING
IT OUT THEMSELVES.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.256
YOUR TIPS IN
ABRACADADDY

18:06.256 --> 18:07.707
AREN'T PRESTO CHANGING THEM.

18:07.707 --> 18:10.340
HA HA. MAGICAL ONE, ELLEN.

18:12.132 --> 18:14.264
WELL, WE'VE COME THIS FAR,
WE CAN'T CAVE NOW.

18:14.264 --> 18:16.306
WOULD YOU GET OUT
OF THE DOG BED?!

18:16.306 --> 18:19.849
I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE
I'D GOTTEN BACK INTO IT.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.771
STOP CANINE OPPRESSION.

18:21.771 --> 18:23.102
WE EMBARRASSED THEM
AND THEY'RE NOT CRACKING.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.024
PEOPLE ARE JUST MAKING
FUN OF US.

18:25.024 --> 18:26.356
LET'S JUST GO BACK INSIDE.

18:26.356 --> 18:30.650
NO. WE CAN'T.
SOME OF US STILL CARE

18:30.650 --> 18:32.572
- ABOUT STAN.
- I STILL CARE
ABOUT STAN.

18:32.572 --> 18:35.034
YOU WERE ABOUT TO
SELL HIM OUT FOR
SOME STUPID BLOW DRYER.

18:35.034 --> 18:37.367
IF BLOW DRYERS ARE STUPID,
I DON'T WANNA BE SMART.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.789
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

18:39.789 --> 18:42.202
THE TWO OF YOU FIGHTING
IS NOT GONNA HELP STAN.

18:42.202 --> 18:45.084
( all arguing )

18:45.084 --> 18:47.086
KIDS, IN. NOW.

18:47.086 --> 18:49.209
ELLEN, IN. NOW.

18:49.209 --> 18:50.630
Both: YOUR WAY
IS WRONG.

18:50.630 --> 18:54.214
- ( all arguing )
- PSST.

19:01.931 --> 19:04.354
- WHAT IS IT, STAN?
- WE NEED TO END THIS.

19:04.354 --> 19:05.685
I WAS BROUGHT HERE
TO BRING THE FAMILY TOGETHER

19:05.685 --> 19:07.767
NOT TEAR IT APART.

19:07.767 --> 19:09.729
WELL, THAT
AND COMIC RELIEF.

19:09.729 --> 19:11.441
THE POINT IS,

19:11.441 --> 19:13.613
IF IT'LL STOP
ALL THE FIGHTING,

19:13.613 --> 19:14.944
I'LL BE AN OUTSIDE DOG.

19:14.944 --> 19:16.696
THESE PAST TWO DAYS
HAVE SHOWN ME

19:16.696 --> 19:19.158
THAT YOU GUYS DO THINK
OF ME AS AN EQUAL.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.700
THAT'S ALL
THAT REALLY MATTERS.

19:20.700 --> 19:22.662
THAT'S VERY SWEET, STAN.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.954
BUT IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO GIVE IN,

19:24.954 --> 19:27.166
MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GIVE THAT MUCH.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.419
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:29.419 --> 19:32.842
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING, SHERRY,
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

19:32.842 --> 19:34.964
WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE TO DO?

19:34.964 --> 19:37.176
AFTER I COULDN'T
TRAIN YOUR DOG YESTERDAY,

19:37.176 --> 19:39.679
I COULDN'T TRAIN
MY NEXT THREE DOGS.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.891
I LOST MY MOJO, MAN.

19:41.891 --> 19:44.434
CANCELLED ALL MY CLIENTS,

19:44.434 --> 19:46.856
AND I'VE JUST BEEN
LOUNGING AROUND THE HOUSE

19:46.856 --> 19:49.309
IN MY "ZERO FAILURE"
PAJAMAS,

19:49.309 --> 19:52.902
WHICH ARE NOW
"ONE FAILURES."

19:52.902 --> 19:54.984
IF YOU COULDN'T TRAIN
YOUR NEXT THREE DOGS,

19:54.984 --> 19:56.776
SHOULDN'T IT BE
FOUR FAILURES?

19:56.776 --> 19:58.368
I'M A MATH GENIUS, YOU KNOW.

19:59.779 --> 20:01.951
I SHOULD JUST GO BACK
TO MY OLD JOB.

20:01.951 --> 20:04.994
CLEANING CIRCUS CAGES
DRESSED AS A CLOWN.

20:04.994 --> 20:08.167
AT LEAST THERE,
I HAD MY DIGNITY.

20:08.167 --> 20:09.919
WELL, SHERRY,

20:09.919 --> 20:12.792
YOU ACTUALLY DID
TRAIN STAN.

20:12.792 --> 20:13.713
IT JUST TOOK
A LITTLE WHILE TO KICK IN.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.835
YEAH, TELL STAN
TO SIT.

20:15.835 --> 20:17.176
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T?

20:17.176 --> 20:20.640
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.
REALLY.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.762
STAN.

20:22.762 --> 20:25.305
PLEASE SIT.

20:25.305 --> 20:26.936
I'M SORRY, NEVER MIND.
DO WHAT YOU WANT.

20:28.938 --> 20:31.150
OH, THAT FELT GOOD.

20:31.150 --> 20:33.853
YEAH, SOMETHING TINGLED.

20:33.853 --> 20:35.355
TELL HIM TO DO
SOMETHING ELSE.

20:35.355 --> 20:37.357
YEAH, SEE IF HE'LL
GO TO HIS BED.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.661
STAN, GO TO YOUR BED.

20:44.163 --> 20:46.916
WOW, LOOK AT THAT.
HE WENT TO HIS BED
INSTEAD OF THE COUCH.

20:46.916 --> 20:48.788
YES, SHERRY'S BACK.

20:48.788 --> 20:50.500
THIS IS MY HOUSE!

20:51.871 --> 20:53.753
WHOA, THIS IS SUPER COMFY.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.675
HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS?

20:55.675 --> 20:57.757
THE QUESTION IS,
DOES IT MUFFLE?

20:57.757 --> 21:00.300
OH, IT MUFFLES.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.552
THIS IS SO GREAT.

21:02.552 --> 21:04.263
NOW I CAN STOP
TELLING MYSELF,

21:04.263 --> 21:06.055
"YOU'RE NOT GOOD
ENOUGH, SHERRY,"

21:06.055 --> 21:07.977
AND GO BACK TO
TELLING MYSELF,

21:07.977 --> 21:09.689
"YOU CAN DO
ANYTHING, SHERRY.

21:09.689 --> 21:12.522
YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL FEET
AND A WINNING SMILE."

21:12.522 --> 21:17.857
WELL, YOU PROBABLY
WANNA GET HOME AND
REWRITE THOSE PAJAMAS.

21:17.857 --> 21:20.450
YEAH, YOU'RE DOWN TO
THREE FAILURES.

21:20.450 --> 21:22.492
MATH GENIUS.

21:22.492 --> 21:24.454
NOW THAT I'M
BACK IN BUSINESS,

21:24.454 --> 21:26.075
THERE'S SOME TENNIS BALLS
AND SQUEAKY TOYS

21:26.075 --> 21:27.997
I NEED TO GET BACK
FROM THE CHARITY BINS.

21:27.997 --> 21:30.500
THANKS, STAN.

21:30.500 --> 21:33.373
I WAS ABOUT TO BECOME
A BETTER PERSON,

21:33.373 --> 21:34.714
BUT NOW I DON'T HAVE TO.

21:34.714 --> 21:36.876
WELL, THANK YOU, SHERRY.

21:36.876 --> 21:38.968
THIS IS MY HOUSE.

21:38.968 --> 21:41.681
YOU DON'T THANK ME.
I'LL THANK MYSELF.

21:41.681 --> 21:44.384
THANK YOU, SHERRY.
THANK YOU.

21:46.846 --> 21:48.728
WELL, THERE YOU GO,
MOM.

21:48.728 --> 21:50.480
STAN IS OFFICIALLY
TRAINABLE.

21:50.480 --> 21:53.272
WELL, IF HE'S WILLING
TO STAY OFF THE FURNITURE,

21:53.272 --> 21:56.856
- I GUESS HE CAN BE
AN INSIDE DOG AGAIN.
- THANK YOU, MOM.

21:56.856 --> 21:59.609
OH, YOU MAY NOT
WANNA DO THAT.
I'M PRETTY DIRTY.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.781
THAT DOESN'T BOTHER
A MOTHER.

22:01.781 --> 22:05.785
I WAS WRONG, I WAS WRONG.
STRONG SMELLS, STRONG SMELLS.

22:05.785 --> 22:09.579
I WAS SO GLAD TO BRING
THE FAMILY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN,

22:09.579 --> 22:11.831
AND ELLEN EVEN SAID
MAYBE I COULD GO ON THE COUCH

22:11.831 --> 22:13.793
AS LONG AS I'M
NOT TOO DIRTY,

22:13.793 --> 22:16.546
BUT FRANKLY, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THAT SO MUCH ANYMORE.

22:16.546 --> 22:18.087
WHAT I'M REALLY
OBSESSED WITH

22:18.087 --> 22:20.089
IS THIS ROCK STAR RABBIT
BOOK I'M READING.

22:28.728 --> 22:30.730
WOW, THESE STORIES
REALLY GRAB YOU,

22:30.730 --> 22:32.732
AND DON'T LET GO.
