00:01.000 --> 00:02.160
Previously on Harrow...

00:02.160 --> 00:04.480
Ice-cream.
What, now?

00:04.480 --> 00:06.160
I think there's only now.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.840
You don't give a shit about Fern.
You're just using her.

00:08.840 --> 00:12.560
Did he tell you that he stole money
from that dead boy's mother?

00:12.560 --> 00:13.640
What would you like?

00:13.640 --> 00:16.080
Something with
22 million answers in it.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.600
Tech support.
Oh, thank Christ. Come in.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.320
This is gonna take me some time.
Take as long as you need.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.480
BROOKES: Cybercrime have another go
at the shipyard phone?

00:23.480 --> 00:24.600
No good.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.440
We might have another lead
on Harrow's son.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.640
James Reed entered the country
on a study visa.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.280
Can you check if someone was here

00:30.280 --> 00:32.920
and they wanted to delete something
permanently?

00:32.920 --> 00:34.760
HARROW: Where's your mother?
She's dead.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.520
Cancer? Why didn't you call me?

00:36.520 --> 00:39.200
I didn't know you existed. Mum said
she didn't know who my father was.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.920
Why did she lie about me?

00:40.920 --> 00:43.040
Hello, Daniel.
Tanya?

00:58.800 --> 01:01.800
Un, deux, trois,

01:01.800 --> 01:05.520
quatre, cinq...

(PISTOLS CLICK)

01:19.120 --> 01:21.400
(WOMAN SCREAMS)

02:09.040 --> 02:11.040
The cancer's in remission.

02:14.120 --> 02:15.640
I'm glad.

02:16.840 --> 02:18.880
Really?

02:18.880 --> 02:22.320
When I imagined...this happening,

02:22.320 --> 02:24.560
I thought you'd be...

02:24.560 --> 02:26.320
..more angry.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.960
I thought I would be too.

02:29.960 --> 02:31.440
(CHUCKLES)

02:35.040 --> 02:37.720
You must have changed your name.

02:37.720 --> 02:40.840
To Hain, my grandmother's surname.

02:40.840 --> 02:42.720
That's what I exhibit under.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.360
You still paint?

02:45.360 --> 02:48.400
And I still run a checkout.

02:48.400 --> 02:52.040
I manage a boutique in Trowbridge.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.520
Not a fortune in painting.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.480
I'm sorry.

03:02.480 --> 03:05.360
I know how hard you tried
to find us.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.600
Why didn't you let me?

03:12.200 --> 03:14.640
You would have talked me back.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.960
Daniel...

03:21.960 --> 03:24.080
..is James in trouble?

03:27.160 --> 03:29.000
I didn't steal a cent.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.960
But I think her son did.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.720
The dead boy?
Max.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.960
I think that's why he needed
a fake passport.

03:40.960 --> 03:43.280
Why he needed to skip the country,
and quick.

03:44.480 --> 03:48.320
You know, it makes sense, if he stole
all that money from Mummy.

03:48.320 --> 03:51.360
You know, what I'm thinking

03:51.360 --> 03:54.760
is that Max had access
to Mila's banking system.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.840
Suddenly, he has a need to leave
the country...

03:57.840 --> 04:00.200
..and now he's dead.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.480
James, is Mila after you
because of her son

04:03.480 --> 04:05.560
or because of her missing money?

04:05.560 --> 04:07.920
I don't know anything about either.

04:07.920 --> 04:11.840
Well, if she thought you did,
what would she do to you?

04:13.560 --> 04:15.240
I think she'd kill me.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.720
I went to the shipyard

04:23.720 --> 04:27.440
and there was a dead young man
who I thought was my son.

04:28.640 --> 04:32.960
I had maybe the worst two days
of my life,

04:32.960 --> 04:35.240
then the DNA results came in...

04:36.400 --> 04:40.200
..and the same night, James shows up.

04:41.880 --> 04:45.120
And now you're here,

04:45.120 --> 04:49.160
I'm not sure I can believe
a word he's told me.

04:52.240 --> 04:55.760
I'm not sure he wasn't involved
in that boy's death.

04:57.320 --> 05:01.080
I guess he knows that,
because now he's not talking to me.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.560
Well, he'll have to talk to me.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.160
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

05:13.160 --> 05:16.360

just uploaded some photos.

05:16.360 --> 05:17.640
From?

05:17.640 --> 05:19.280
Daniel Harrow's boat.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.080
OK.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.320
Jesus. Is that...?

05:29.320 --> 05:31.480
We checked her face scan
with Border Protection.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.000
changed by deed poll in 1998

05:35.000 --> 05:37.600
from Tanya Ann Reed.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.560
Pull them in?

05:43.160 --> 05:44.640
No.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.200
Let's see where they take us.

05:51.760 --> 05:54.240
TANYA: I can't believe
you still have the Fiat.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.480
Ha! I remember this.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.880
Found it in a box of your things.

06:11.240 --> 06:14.120
You stole it on our first date,

06:14.120 --> 06:16.560
from that Mexican restaurant
in Great Portland Street.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.040
We'd had mescal

06:18.040 --> 06:20.440
and I was worried about that
waitress who kept flirting with you.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.760
(STARTS CAR)

06:28.760 --> 06:30.320
Why aren't we moving?

06:33.520 --> 06:35.800
Because THEY'RE not.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.640

06:37.640 --> 06:40.120
..we can't go see James.

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

06:53.880 --> 06:55.880
Will you excuse me for a second?

06:58.640 --> 07:02.280
You're like a failing Instagrammer.
You need better followers.

07:02.280 --> 07:05.560
And you needed to tell me
about your visitor.

07:05.560 --> 07:07.920
I didn't even know
Tanya was still alive!

07:07.920 --> 07:10.120
You had all night to let me know.

07:10.120 --> 07:14.360
Oh, and following me is a great way
to encourage open communication.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.520
What else? Tapping my calls?

07:17.680 --> 07:20.680
Harrow, I know your son
is in the country

07:20.680 --> 07:24.080
and he is a person of interest
in what might be a homicide.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.560
And that is why,
even if I did know where he was,

07:26.560 --> 07:28.200
I wouldn't tell you.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.600
So, you don't know
where your son is?

07:29.600 --> 07:30.880
No.

07:30.880 --> 07:34.240
And neither does Tanya, so...
leave us alone.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.600
Morning.
Hi.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.080
Everything OK?

07:43.080 --> 07:44.640
Yeah. Fine.

07:44.640 --> 07:49.080
Me too. I had my two ice-creams
last night and slept like a baby.

07:49.080 --> 07:52.120
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

07:52.120 --> 07:54.880
Something came up.
Something always does.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.720
OK. Martin Bruce Peek.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.320
George Vaughn Ilic.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.480
Grave robbers.

08:04.480 --> 08:07.400
Duellists.
Members of an historical society.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.000
Mm. Former members.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.320
Why were they duelling?

08:10.320 --> 08:12.920
Well, apparently
Mr Ilic said something

08:12.920 --> 08:14.880
to which Mr Peek took offence.

08:14.880 --> 08:16.680
Well, 10 paces at dawn.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.000
And their seconds?

08:21.240 --> 08:25.360
In a duel, the combatants are
each accompanied by their seconds,

08:25.360 --> 08:27.600
who try to dissuade them
from fighting

08:27.600 --> 08:29.280
and to check and hand over
the weapons.

08:29.280 --> 08:32.920
Yeah, well, we're interviewing
two people at CIB now

08:32.920 --> 08:35.400
but both claim they thought
these two were shooting blanks.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.920
Like my ex-wife,
just before we had a daughter.

08:40.400 --> 08:44.480
And the referee,
whomever gave the signal to fire?

08:44.480 --> 08:47.080
He's gone to ground.
We're looking for him.

08:47.080 --> 08:50.400
So, I'll leave these with you.

08:50.400 --> 08:53.120
Just send 'em back with the clothes
and, uh...

..any developments, you let me know.

(INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER)

09:10.920 --> 09:14.560
Well, this is the first duel
I've ever done.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.120
Mine too,

09:16.120 --> 09:18.520
although I did nearly kill
Abigail Stock -

09:18.520 --> 09:20.520
we were both running for
debate captain.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.640
(CHUCKLES) To her credit, though,

09:22.640 --> 09:24.880
she did at least
turn up to the event.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.960
Ah. I see satisfaction was had.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.120
Pistols at dawn, eh?

09:33.120 --> 09:34.880
How romantic.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.680
I could shoot you at dawn,
if you like, or any time, really.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.280
Oh, ha, ha.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.360
You may recall
that I was famously known,

09:41.360 --> 09:43.720
in the Aldenham Secondary
Air Rifle Brigade,

09:43.720 --> 09:45.960
as Crack Shot Fairley.

09:45.960 --> 09:50.400
That was because of that pellet
that wound up in your gluteal cleft.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.480
No, I... My... But...

09:53.480 --> 09:54.800
Yes, your butt!

09:54.800 --> 09:58.320
Anyway, were there any
underlying medical issues?

09:58.320 --> 10:01.240
Uh, it seems Mr Ilic
was fit as a fiddle,

10:01.240 --> 10:03.200
same as Mr Peek,

10:03.200 --> 10:05.920
except for minor heartburn
and restless leg syndrome.

10:05.920 --> 10:08.520
Hmm. They both had pretty good aim.

10:08.520 --> 10:11.840
They were both long-term members
of the Brisbane Faro Society.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.400
Oh, Faro!

10:13.400 --> 10:17.000
A card game derived from Basset
and a precursor to poker.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.560
Very popular in Europe
in the 18th and 19th century.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.640
Are there any other wounds?

10:21.640 --> 10:23.720
Mr Peek has something
very faint here.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.800
Now, is that under the make-up?

10:28.800 --> 10:32.040
It looks like under.
I think that's lipstick.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.680
Hmm. Well, makes sense.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.520
Someone kissed him good luck.

10:35.520 --> 10:38.520
Or goodbye, if she knew
the pistols were loaded.

10:38.520 --> 10:41.480
Nichols said the witnesses thought
the guns were not.

10:41.480 --> 10:46.160
Hmm. Pair of matching
flintlock duelling pistols.

10:46.160 --> 10:49.760
Smooth bore.
Early 19th, late 18th century.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.480
Worth a bit.
Mm.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.600
They were Peek's, apparently.
He had a licence.

10:53.600 --> 10:57.000
Well, let's swab their hands
for gunpowder residue.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.120
Are the CTs ready?
Mm-hm.

11:00.280 --> 11:01.520
Right.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.280
Looking at that path of travel,
the one on the left -

11:04.280 --> 11:05.800
the shot broke the fifth rib

11:05.800 --> 11:07.840
and passed right through
both ventricles.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.640
Yes and this,
through the right lung,

11:09.640 --> 11:11.680
severing the superior vena cava.

11:11.680 --> 11:14.840
They were certainly aiming
at one another's hearts.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.240
They really wanted
to kill each other.

11:17.240 --> 11:20.400
Or really didn't think they would.

11:21.920 --> 11:25.120
Let's take a look at
those lead shots.

11:32.120 --> 11:33.760
Fairley?

11:40.160 --> 11:43.080
Fishing sinkers.
Makes sense.

11:43.080 --> 11:46.000
Practical. Easy to get.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.400
"Ruffian."

11:48.400 --> 11:52.160
Hmm. But what was worth killing for?

12:06.880 --> 12:09.440
"Valour withers without an opponent."

12:11.240 --> 12:13.520
Oh, we were all shocked.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.360
I'm still shocked.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.520
And, Miss Mills,
you are the club's...

12:17.520 --> 12:19.880
New marketing manager.
Right.

12:19.880 --> 12:22.360
Which entails...?
Raising interest.

12:22.360 --> 12:24.840
She's doing a great job. She...
Yeah.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.360
Uh, forgive me, Ms Mellis,

12:26.360 --> 12:28.880
but you don't strike me
as a Faro aficionado.

12:28.880 --> 12:32.440
Oh, uh... (CHUCKLES) ..uh, well,
I was just doing it for my CV

12:32.440 --> 12:36.600
but I've discovered that
it's a great game of skill and wit.

12:36.600 --> 12:39.000
I'm learning so much.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.720
It is such a shame
we lost Martin and George.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.160
They were experts.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.440
Do you know what the duel was over?

12:47.640 --> 12:49.320
What's any duel over?

12:49.320 --> 12:51.480
Greed?

12:51.480 --> 12:53.480
Pride.
Right.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.400
Ms Yancy, you're
the club's treasurer?

12:58.640 --> 13:02.080
Uh, so, do you know why Mr Peek
and Mr Ilic were arguing?

13:02.080 --> 13:03.440
The game.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.720
The...the annual championship?

13:05.720 --> 13:08.040
50-year-anniversary championship.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.560
The winner gets the time capsule.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.600
What's in the time capsule?

13:13.600 --> 13:16.400
Um...we can't see for sure.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.960
We've only got one photo

13:17.960 --> 13:20.400
and, unfortunately,
it's completely out of focus.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.440
But it's nothing valuable -
it's more about the prestige.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.600
The unearthing will be a big deal.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.400
There'll be local papers.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.280
Emeline's trying to get
the local TV news...

13:30.280 --> 13:32.160
Yep, yep. The argument?

13:32.160 --> 13:34.200
Martin and George were playing.

13:34.200 --> 13:37.520
When George...when George said...

13:37.520 --> 13:39.520
George said that
he was growing so old

13:39.520 --> 13:41.520
waiting for Martin to place his bet,

13:41.520 --> 13:44.000
that he was starting to find
Martin's wife attractive.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.680
Pretty mild trash-talk.

13:47.680 --> 13:48.920
Oh, not for Faro.

13:48.920 --> 13:52.600
Martin took offence and, later,
he challenged George to a duel.

13:52.600 --> 13:55.240
Have there been duels here before?

13:56.240 --> 14:00.840
Yes, but they were usually settled
by a card game or a fencing bout.

14:00.840 --> 14:01.960
Mm-hm.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.240
Sometimes with pistols
and paintballs.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.920
But not lead bullets.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.560
No! Never.

14:07.560 --> 14:10.160
So, Mr Dugald Hogarth

14:10.160 --> 14:12.080
is the winner by default?

14:12.080 --> 14:14.040
Uh, now, he's our missing referee.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.560
Have either of you seen him?

14:16.920 --> 14:20.880
I don't see your name here
on the list, Ms Mellis.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.640
Oh, I thought I was too new
to the club to play.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.400
Maybe I should have.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.760
Where does Mr Peek keep his pistols?

14:31.960 --> 14:36.080
(SIGHS) I'm, uh, very sorry
for your loss, Mrs Peek,

14:36.080 --> 14:38.840
and to trouble you with
more questions at this time

14:38.840 --> 14:42.040
but, uh, you were your husband's
second at the duel?

14:42.040 --> 14:43.720
Yes, that's right.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.920
But you didn't load his pistol?

14:45.920 --> 14:48.720
No, no. I just handed it to him.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.160
Corneal transplants.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.160
Oh, yes.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.760
Um, I'm afraid
Martin was going through...

15:00.760 --> 15:02.800
..a bit of a mid-life crisis.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.880
Rather Dr Harrow's area
of expertise.

15:05.880 --> 15:08.360
It wasn't like him, though.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.160
He was always
a very responsible man.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.200
He was a tax accountant!

15:13.200 --> 15:17.080
But the last few months, he changed.

15:17.080 --> 15:20.160
He became secretive, deceptive.

15:20.160 --> 15:23.000
That's also Dr Harrow's area.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.800
Mrs Peek, did your husband
have restless leg syndrome?

15:29.800 --> 15:32.000
Was this something new?
No.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.240
No, but, uh, more recently,
it had become a sort of a...

15:36.240 --> 15:41.000
..well, restless hand syndrome
and restless other...things.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.040
Uh...his, uh, marital appetite...

15:47.280 --> 15:49.800
And then there was
the gambling losses and...

15:49.800 --> 15:52.080
But I thought you said
he didn't gamble for money.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.600
Not until this recent
Faro championship

15:54.600 --> 16:00.360
and then it became online poker,
online sports, online horses...

16:00.360 --> 16:02.440
Did you want it to end?

16:02.440 --> 16:05.440
Oh, yes! Of course I did.

16:07.520 --> 16:11.280
(CLEARS THROAT) Where did he
keep his guns, Mrs Peek?

16:21.880 --> 16:24.120
There's paint balls
but no lead shot.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.640
Do you have a key for this,
Mrs Peek?

16:27.640 --> 16:31.160
Martin was the only one
who had a key.

16:31.160 --> 16:32.720
Sarge?

16:32.720 --> 16:34.560
Oh.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.040
Thanks, Mick.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.040
(SIGHS) "Ruffian."

16:49.040 --> 16:50.720
I need to sit down.

16:51.960 --> 16:55.680
Mrs Peek, this morning,
before the duel,

16:55.680 --> 16:57.840
did you kiss your husband good luck?

17:00.840 --> 17:02.800
I, uh...I think so.

17:06.600 --> 17:09.560
Then I guess that just leaves
our referee.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.320
Hmm.
(PHONE RINGS)

17:14.080 --> 17:17.240
Mr Dugald Hogarth. Our referee.

17:17.240 --> 17:19.880
Why did he run from the duel?

17:19.880 --> 17:21.600
Well, he was upset,

17:21.600 --> 17:24.440
seeing two club-mates die
unexpectedly in front of him.

17:24.440 --> 17:27.520
Two club-mates he was playing
in the grand final.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.440
Well...
Could he have tampered with the guns?

17:29.440 --> 17:31.840
No key, solid alibi

17:31.840 --> 17:34.160
and a severe allergy to seafood.

17:35.160 --> 17:37.120
Anaphylaxis-bad.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.560
There's no way he could have
touched Mr Peek's fishing kit

17:39.560 --> 17:41.040
without having a seizure.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.560
No, Mr Hogarth
may have had the motive

17:43.560 --> 17:45.200
but he has a watertight alibi.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.440
Mrs Peek may have had the means
but no motive.

17:47.440 --> 17:50.400
No, no - we have two dead men
with their fingers on the trigger,

17:50.400 --> 17:52.880
one of whom owned both the guns
and the sinkers

17:52.880 --> 17:55.680
and had clearly been taking things
a little bit too seriously,

17:55.680 --> 17:57.360
including card-game insults -

17:57.360 --> 17:58.840
am I right so far?

17:58.840 --> 18:01.160
Righto. Well, if you find
anything new, you let me know.

18:01.160 --> 18:03.560
Otherwise, I have another
potential murder investigation

18:03.560 --> 18:05.200
that I need to continue.

18:26.760 --> 18:29.240
Tell me they died
for something worthwhile.

18:29.240 --> 18:32.040
Love? Fortune?

18:32.040 --> 18:36.040
A schoolyard taunt that, frankly,
Fairley could do better.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.160
You had a phone call earlier.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.960
You answered my phone?

18:40.960 --> 18:42.560
Your office has good wi-fi.

19:00.920 --> 19:03.480
Hi.
Hi.

19:04.760 --> 19:07.120
As I was saying,

19:07.120 --> 19:10.200
yes, James is here, in Australia.

19:10.200 --> 19:13.120
He told me he'd been accepted
into computer studies

19:13.120 --> 19:14.640
at the University of Adelaide

19:14.640 --> 19:17.720
but at home, I got an email
from the university

19:17.720 --> 19:20.200
about overdue fees.

19:21.240 --> 19:27.240
I rang and apparently, James
had never attended one lecture.

19:27.240 --> 19:29.800
I tried to call him. Got no answer.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.360
I rang the consulate,
thinking the worst

19:32.360 --> 19:34.000
but he wasn't dead,

19:34.000 --> 19:35.480
so I came out.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.320
Do you think...
No.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.120
And where did you start?
With his father.

19:41.120 --> 19:43.000
Ah.
Yes. See...

19:43.000 --> 19:44.720
Shut up.
(CHUCKLES)

19:44.720 --> 19:48.560
I arrived last night.
I went to Daniel's boat.

19:48.560 --> 19:52.440
He told me there was a boy
who died in a shipyard.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.720
OK. Here, I really...
Harrow.

19:54.720 --> 19:57.920
Daniel said it seemed for a while
this might be James.

19:57.920 --> 20:01.560
Then he told me that after the DNA
proved it wasn't,

20:01.560 --> 20:03.920
that James...

20:06.600 --> 20:09.400
..was nowhere to be found.

20:10.560 --> 20:14.680
Daniel looked everywhere. No luck.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.600
So, I don't know if James
is not in town after all

20:17.600 --> 20:19.840
or if Daniel's just a bit...

20:20.880 --> 20:22.360
..useless.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.560
Is this your son?

20:31.560 --> 20:33.000
Yes.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.200
And neither of you have seen him.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.600
That's what I've been telling you.

20:40.360 --> 20:42.080
Then explain to me...

20:43.200 --> 20:44.880
..why you left this.

20:44.880 --> 20:47.680
HARROW: (ON VOICEMAIL) Listen, I
really need to speak to your brother.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.600
If you see him, get him to call me.

20:52.400 --> 20:56.280
Well, you convinced me
James was here.

20:56.280 --> 21:01.320
My name in that passport, the note
on the body that seemed to be for me.

21:01.320 --> 21:02.800
So, I left a message.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.920
And she's had no contact?

21:06.360 --> 21:08.800
I mean, if she has, I don't know.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.560
You've been listening to my phone.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.920
So, just tell me straight -
have I come to the right city?

21:12.920 --> 21:14.560
If my son is not in Brisbane,

21:14.560 --> 21:17.280
I am not going to waste
any more time here.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.880
Well, I'm sorry but I can't tell you
anything else at the moment.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.520
Well, when you do find him...

21:24.800 --> 21:27.080
..please call me.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.600
Nice to see you again, Daniel.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.040
So, do you still...

21:43.040 --> 21:44.960
No. Go see her out.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.200
"Bit useless"?

21:52.200 --> 21:54.000
Should get them off our backs.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.160
FERN: And we are in.

22:00.160 --> 22:02.720
OK. So now what?

22:02.720 --> 22:04.680
Now we look.

22:04.680 --> 22:06.200
For what?

22:06.200 --> 22:10.160
For bodies due to be released
back to their next of kin.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.240
Why?

22:12.240 --> 22:14.920
'Cause sometimes, when bodies
are released to next of kin,

22:14.920 --> 22:16.960
so are their possessions.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.680
Here - Lawrence Paul Schumann.

22:19.680 --> 22:22.400
Nursing home death,
determined to be of natural causes.

22:22.400 --> 22:27.320
Mr Schumann's belongings are held in
police CIB and can now be released.

22:27.320 --> 22:30.560
Right. Right.
And is there a case code?

22:30.560 --> 22:33.120
The question is,
can you swap the case code

22:33.120 --> 22:35.320
with the one attached to your phone?

22:37.160 --> 22:40.280
(CHUCKLES) OK. I gotta go to work.
Let me know.

22:40.280 --> 22:42.080
OK.

22:51.120 --> 22:54.360
52184.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.200
(TYPES)

22:56.200 --> 22:57.880
(DOOR BELL BUZZES)

22:58.960 --> 23:00.680
What did you forget?

23:17.320 --> 23:20.480
Why did you tell Daniel I was dead?

23:20.480 --> 23:22.640
Why did you tell me
you never knew his name?

23:22.640 --> 23:25.520
It's hard to believe anything you say
anymore, James.

23:25.520 --> 23:28.000
No, that much is true.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
I told you that because I didn't
want you going to find him.

23:33.000 --> 23:38.440
I didn't want you falling in love
with who he is and what he does.

23:39.760 --> 23:42.040
I didn't want to lose you.

23:42.040 --> 23:44.360
You didn't think
I'd ever want to know?

23:44.360 --> 23:46.520
Did you think I was stupid?
No!

23:46.520 --> 23:49.280
I was the stupid one, thinking
you wouldn't go looking for him.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.240
Could have just told him.

23:51.240 --> 23:53.640
You know how it is with lies.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.560
Maybe you don't.

23:57.400 --> 24:01.080
After a while, they become so big,
they just...

24:02.440 --> 24:04.840
..they won't go back in the bottle.

24:05.840 --> 24:09.120
Right, James?
University of Adelaide?

24:10.160 --> 24:12.320
I wanted to find my dad.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.120
And you have.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.760
What now?

24:15.760 --> 24:18.120
Now...I need my phone.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.600
If I get that,
I get everyone off my back.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.160
What, including Mila Zoric?

24:23.160 --> 24:25.320
My phone will prove
I didn't kill Max!

24:25.320 --> 24:29.200
The only way you'll get it back
is if you turn yourself in.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.680
I can pay for a lawyer.

24:31.680 --> 24:35.200
What happens then? What if...
what if you get your phone back?

24:35.200 --> 24:38.360
All this goes away. What then?

24:40.280 --> 24:42.040
Will you stay here?

24:48.440 --> 24:50.520
Why didn't you just
tell me his name?

24:53.480 --> 24:55.400
You look terrible, Mum.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.440
Go get some sleep.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.480
Are you sure?

25:02.480 --> 25:06.000
You might be more comfortable
back at your hotel.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.680
Uh-uh.

25:13.560 --> 25:15.760
Why didn't you tell him?

25:18.440 --> 25:20.480
It was the dead.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.280
What?

25:24.280 --> 25:28.360
I didn't want my baby
being raised around the dead.

26:01.880 --> 26:04.480
# Who spoke of him ill... #

26:07.160 --> 26:09.160
Catching up on work?

26:09.160 --> 26:11.800
Loose ends. You?

26:13.400 --> 26:15.840
Trying to balance the books too.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.720
Your boy at home?

26:19.720 --> 26:23.040
Louie is with his father this week,

26:23.040 --> 26:26.840
so rather than sitting at home
missing him, I work.

26:26.840 --> 26:28.440
You?

26:28.440 --> 26:31.040
Seems I sit at home, missing work.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.200
The mystery duellists?

26:36.200 --> 26:37.960
(SIGHS)

26:39.520 --> 26:42.600
See, I know what killed them.

26:42.600 --> 26:45.080
But I still don't know...

26:45.080 --> 26:46.600
Why?

26:46.600 --> 26:48.360
Yes.

26:48.360 --> 26:52.760
See, according to Mr Peek's wife, he
suffered from restless leg syndrome.

26:52.760 --> 26:54.920
Hmm. So he had trouble sleeping too.

26:54.920 --> 26:56.880
Mm, and according to this,

26:56.880 --> 27:00.680
he was prescribed a medication
by the name of Pramipexole.

27:00.680 --> 27:01.960
And?

27:01.960 --> 27:06.120
It has reported side effects,
including a heightened sex drive,

27:06.120 --> 27:10.080
increased recklessness and
an exaggerated desire to gamble,

27:10.080 --> 27:13.000
which would explain Mr Peek's
recent behaviour.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.480
It doesn't excuse him.

27:15.520 --> 27:17.320
No.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.960
What's this?

27:19.960 --> 27:22.000
1-phenyl...

27:22.000 --> 27:26.040
1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidinone. Phenidone?

27:27.120 --> 27:29.160
Where was that?
On his hands.

27:29.160 --> 27:32.440
Traces of gunpowder
with minute traces of that.

27:32.440 --> 27:34.200
What is it?

27:34.200 --> 27:36.240
Phenidone.

27:36.240 --> 27:38.360
It's a darkroom chemical.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.600
Photographic developer.

27:41.800 --> 27:44.800
But Peek didn't have
a darkroom at his house.

27:50.120 --> 27:52.200
Hello?

27:52.200 --> 27:54.680
Hello!
Oh! Mr...

27:54.680 --> 27:56.160
Harrow.

27:56.160 --> 27:58.600
Late night for you?
Yes.

27:58.600 --> 28:01.440
Just, um, getting ready
for the big final tomorrow night

28:01.440 --> 28:03.200
and the unsealing the next day.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.120
Exciting.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.040
How is there a final?

28:09.000 --> 28:12.080
Ah. So, Ms Mellis is playing.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.560
How?

28:13.560 --> 28:17.080
Well, uh, apparently,
there is a clause in the charter -

28:17.080 --> 28:19.320
if there are insufficient players
in a match,

28:19.320 --> 28:21.520
the treasurer
can nominate a stand-in.

28:21.520 --> 28:25.520
And Ms Mellis asked you
to nominate her.

28:26.640 --> 28:29.800
Well, it is a bit of a change
to have a woman in the final.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.320
Emeline's been
a wonderful marketing manager.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.760
She's really got
a nose for attention.

28:34.760 --> 28:38.120
You know, putting the club online
and the newsletters.

28:38.120 --> 28:40.280
Oh, speaking of newsletters,

28:40.280 --> 28:43.720
do you know if there was anyone here
developing photographs?

28:45.560 --> 28:49.680
The darkroom's been here since
the start of the club, 50 years ago.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.520
Did Mr Peek use it?

28:52.520 --> 28:56.160
Martin? No. But Emeline does.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.680
She found some old photos
in the files.

29:00.680 --> 29:03.000
She thought she might put some
in the latest newsletter

29:03.000 --> 29:05.200
but, uh, they're not too good,
apparently.

29:08.440 --> 29:11.880
These are from the laying
of the time capsule.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.440
Really?

29:15.160 --> 29:16.680
There's a frame missing.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.760
Do you have any idea
where she might have put it?

29:26.760 --> 29:28.720
Well, Yancy wouldn't know.

29:28.720 --> 29:31.200
Hi. Came to help you set up.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.520
And look who we find in the dark!

29:33.520 --> 29:35.080
He's a policeman.

29:35.080 --> 29:37.080
Well, he's a doctor.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.840
Maybe we should get Yancy
to call the police,

29:39.840 --> 29:41.640
for trespassing.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.160
She let me in.

29:43.160 --> 29:45.080
Oh, looking for secrets!

29:45.080 --> 29:46.840
You won't find any.

29:46.840 --> 29:49.680
Is that what you told Mr Peek?

29:50.760 --> 29:54.320
Was he in here too,
right before the duel?

29:54.320 --> 29:56.760
I gather Mr Peek
can't kiss and tell.

29:57.920 --> 29:59.240
No.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.680
Where's the missing frame?

30:02.680 --> 30:05.440
I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:05.440 --> 30:07.000
Shame.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.200
I really quite like
seeing how things develop.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.080
Ah.
Good luck with your game.

30:13.080 --> 30:14.760
Kiss for luck?

30:16.360 --> 30:19.160
I'm afraid I do kiss and tell.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.680
Oh.

30:22.560 --> 30:25.880
It was very sad, what happened
to Martin and George.

30:25.880 --> 30:27.320
Hmm.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.520
There's nothing to find here.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.160
You're leaving late.

30:47.160 --> 30:50.720
And you're starting early.
What have I caught you doing?

30:50.720 --> 30:52.360
Hiding evidence?

30:53.880 --> 30:56.200
Gathering evidence.

30:56.200 --> 30:58.320
Of male vanity?

30:59.320 --> 31:00.960
Maybe of murder.

31:04.120 --> 31:06.040
You kissed Mrs Peek?
No.

31:06.040 --> 31:09.280
It looks like the same lipstick
found on Mr Peek.

31:09.280 --> 31:11.760
Now, it might be Mrs Peek's,
it might be someone else's.

31:11.760 --> 31:13.640
I'm losing interest.
And my appetite.

31:13.640 --> 31:18.360
Look, Mr Peek had an almost-faded
lipstick mark on his cheek

31:18.360 --> 31:20.400
under the make-up he wore to duel,

31:20.400 --> 31:22.640
which means he was kissed earlier.

31:22.640 --> 31:25.000
Now, it's the same shade of lipstick

31:25.000 --> 31:27.640
Ms Mellis wore
when she kissed my cheek.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.440
Did she kiss... Eugh. God.

31:29.440 --> 31:32.320
Can you prove it was Ms Mellis
who kissed Mr Peek?

31:32.320 --> 31:38.280
No. But Peek also had faint traces
of a darkroom chemical on him.

31:38.280 --> 31:42.040
Now, there is a darkroom at
the Faro club that Ms Mellis uses.

31:42.040 --> 31:44.400
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
he didn't use it by himself.

31:44.400 --> 31:47.120
But you still think Emeline Mellis
put the sinkers in the gun

31:47.120 --> 31:49.160
so they'd kill each other.
Yes!

31:49.160 --> 31:52.680
To join the Faro game where there's
nothing to win but the game itself!

31:52.680 --> 31:57.040
Except there is missing film
of the time capsule's contents.

31:57.040 --> 32:00.680
Perhaps Ms Mellis knows
there's something valuable in it

32:00.680 --> 32:02.920
and that's what she wants to win.

32:04.560 --> 32:06.760
So, what do you want me to do?

32:12.160 --> 32:14.320
This is bloody ridiculous.

32:14.320 --> 32:17.720
It's hot. I'm itchy. We can just
wait until we get a warrant Monday.

32:17.720 --> 32:20.400
No! They play the final tonight.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.280
There'll be nothing left to search
for Monday.

32:22.280 --> 32:26.320
Let's just play and watch
Emeline Mellis's face when you win.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.600
Yeah, but I...I've never
played Faro!

32:29.800 --> 32:32.080
You're the precinct's poker champion!

32:32.080 --> 32:34.320
Come on. How hard can it be?

32:47.320 --> 32:49.120
What are you doing here?

32:50.240 --> 32:52.040
We have come to play.

32:52.040 --> 32:55.880
Oh! (LAUGHS)
You're not even members.

32:55.880 --> 32:57.880
Actually, we are.

32:57.880 --> 33:00.320
We joined online, thanks to you.

33:00.320 --> 33:04.880
And according to section 9.5
of your charter,

33:04.880 --> 33:08.760
in the event of the passing
of permanent members,

33:08.760 --> 33:11.520
any new members
may take their places.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.720
Um...Mellie, he's right.

33:14.720 --> 33:16.200
He's right.

33:17.400 --> 33:18.880
You can play.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.440
(QUIET CONVERSATION)

33:25.440 --> 33:29.880
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the 50th-anniversary final.

33:29.880 --> 33:33.080
At stake is the time capsule
laid down in 1970,

33:33.080 --> 33:35.680
which will be unsealed
tomorrow at noon

33:35.680 --> 33:37.680
and presented to the winner.

33:37.680 --> 33:40.080
(APPLAUSE)

33:43.560 --> 33:45.280
Mr Hogarth.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.800
Let's play.

33:47.800 --> 33:50.480
I think what we have to do is...
Shh!

33:51.880 --> 33:53.520
I've got this.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.280
Bets, please.

33:56.640 --> 33:58.160
Nine.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.440
Mr Nichols?
Mm?

34:05.440 --> 34:07.200
Bet.

34:12.160 --> 34:13.760
Mr Harrow?

34:17.720 --> 34:20.480
Losing card...dame de pique.

34:20.480 --> 34:23.440
Winning card, neuf de coeur.

34:23.440 --> 34:25.200
Ms Mellis wins.

34:28.920 --> 34:30.960
I thought you said you got it.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.560
It's a matter of counting cards.
Can you count cards?

34:33.560 --> 34:35.040
No.
Then shut up.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.760
Bets, please.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.040
Jack, please.

34:52.480 --> 34:54.040
Losing card,

34:54.040 --> 34:55.520
valet de carreau.

34:56.520 --> 34:59.360
Winning card, as de carreau.

34:59.360 --> 35:01.280
Mr Nichols wins.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.600
You OK?

35:09.600 --> 35:11.400
No, it's this bloody outfit.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.440
I feel like a chook in an oven bag.

35:14.840 --> 35:17.360
Bets, please.

35:17.360 --> 35:18.880
Ace.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.680
Losing card, as de trefle.

35:52.680 --> 35:54.520
Winning card...

35:55.800 --> 35:57.440
..cinque de carreau.

35:57.440 --> 35:59.400
Mr Nichols wins again.

35:59.400 --> 36:01.320
(APPLAUSE)

36:03.560 --> 36:05.800
Well, I need a drink. Gentlemen?

36:05.800 --> 36:08.040
Oh. Yes, please.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.920
Not for me, thanks.

36:11.400 --> 36:14.800
And...we pause.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.920
Well, this is going well!

36:17.920 --> 36:20.000
Well, I'm going well.
You're terrible.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.480
What's your plan?

36:21.480 --> 36:25.440
Well, she eliminated Peek and Ilic
and thought she could beat Hogarth.

36:25.440 --> 36:28.480
But you're unsettling her.

36:28.480 --> 36:31.000
Assuming your theory's correct,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.600
what is she gonna do
in front of all these people?

36:34.600 --> 36:35.840
I don't know.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.520
Ah. I got you one anyway.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.280
I wouldn't drink that if I were you.

36:50.960 --> 36:52.440
What?

36:52.440 --> 36:54.200
And we resume.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.240
Mr Nichols?

37:03.240 --> 37:05.080
Uh...

37:07.480 --> 37:09.320
Mr Hogarth?

37:09.320 --> 37:11.040
I...

37:12.880 --> 37:14.440
Uh, here. No.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.200
Here.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.200
I feel...a bit crook.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.440
I think you were drugged.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.760
OK. Um...

37:23.760 --> 37:25.400
I need to get some fresh air.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.560
You win the game.

37:31.800 --> 37:33.760
I think there was something wrong
with those drinks.

37:35.400 --> 37:37.280
Do you wish to call the game?

37:40.040 --> 37:41.520
No.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.320
Your bet.

37:53.080 --> 37:54.720
Huit de coeur...

37:55.760 --> 37:58.040
..et la dame de trefle.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.160
Ms Mellis wins.

38:00.160 --> 38:02.080
(APPLAUSE)

38:03.560 --> 38:05.640
Mr Hogarth is out.

38:08.160 --> 38:11.280
We are down to our last three cards.

38:11.280 --> 38:12.920
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

38:14.680 --> 38:18.360
What did you find in the photograph
of the time capsule?

38:19.480 --> 38:22.080
What is it that you were
prepared to kill for?

38:22.080 --> 38:24.800
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

38:25.840 --> 38:27.680
But I do know I'm going to win.

38:29.200 --> 38:30.800
You are good at calculating odds.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.200
Ah, unlike you.

38:33.240 --> 38:34.840
True.

38:34.840 --> 38:37.000
But I'm good at hunches.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.640
Bets, please.

38:46.560 --> 38:48.240
Mr Harrow?

38:48.240 --> 38:53.480
I believe I can bet on the order
the last three cards appear.

38:54.680 --> 38:58.240
And if I'm right,
I win four times the bet.

38:58.240 --> 39:00.720
I read the rule book.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.040
Which will make you the winner.

39:04.040 --> 39:06.960
Then I wager the last card

39:06.960 --> 39:09.120
is the valet de trefle.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.240
The jack of clubs.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.120
Losing card...

39:19.120 --> 39:20.880
dix de carreau.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.760
Winning card...

39:24.800 --> 39:26.440
..le roi de pique,

39:26.440 --> 39:30.080
which means last card is, indeed...

39:30.080 --> 39:31.800
..the jack of clubs.

39:31.800 --> 39:33.520
Mr Harrow wins.

39:34.760 --> 39:36.840
Congratulations, Mr Harrow.

39:36.840 --> 39:38.800
It seems the time capsule is yours.

39:45.840 --> 39:48.240
Oh! (LAUGHS) Thank you. Thank you.
That's very kind of you.

39:48.240 --> 39:50.120
Thank you, everyone.
We'll see you tomorrow.

39:53.160 --> 39:54.840
Ms Mellis?

39:54.840 --> 39:58.640
You can dash off but the police
don't take too kindly to murder,

39:58.640 --> 40:00.320
let alone drugging a police officer.

40:00.320 --> 40:02.880
Like I said, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

40:02.880 --> 40:05.440
What was in that time capsule
that was worth killing for?

40:05.440 --> 40:08.080
You seriously are deluded!

40:08.080 --> 40:10.800
You wanted to win.
Yes, I did!

40:10.800 --> 40:12.840
I thought I might be in the papers.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.040
Maybe on TV. Sue me.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.400
But you found the photograph
of the time capsule.

40:17.400 --> 40:18.640
Oh!

40:20.760 --> 40:24.360
It was just a bunch of old crap.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.000
I just wanted the cards.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.520
They are collector's items.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.840
And when Yancy found the loophole
to let me play,

40:30.840 --> 40:32.680
we agreed
that I would keep the cards

40:32.680 --> 40:34.520
and she could keep everything else.

40:34.520 --> 40:38.360
But you kissed me on the cheek,
just like you kissed Martin Peek.

40:38.360 --> 40:41.040
Oh, my God! Don't be gross!

40:41.040 --> 40:43.120
I never kissed Martin.

40:45.520 --> 40:47.280
Then who did?

40:49.360 --> 40:51.680
(SLAMS CAR DOOR, STARTS ENGINE)

41:10.480 --> 41:14.400
Wondering if you have time to unseal
it before the police catch you?

41:16.680 --> 41:22.680
It was you who recognised what
Emeline had found in this old photo.

41:24.960 --> 41:27.640
An antique deck of cards...

41:28.960 --> 41:31.000
..and an old envelope,

41:31.000 --> 41:35.760
stamped with a plate 77 penny red.

41:37.920 --> 41:39.400
What's it worth?

41:41.360 --> 41:42.960
Over half a million.

41:45.720 --> 41:49.200
These dusty old fools had no idea.

41:54.720 --> 41:57.200
You were eliminated
from the game early.

41:57.200 --> 42:00.520
Then Emeline showed you
the photo she found

42:00.520 --> 42:03.400
and you needed a patsy
to play for you,

42:03.400 --> 42:05.200
so you convinced her.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.120
I told her I knew
how to get her in the game.

42:07.120 --> 42:10.880
If she won, that beautiful flirt
would have her face on the news

42:10.880 --> 42:12.880
and I'd get the envelope.

42:15.600 --> 42:19.920
Peek and Ilic were the best players
of the club, so they had to go.

42:19.920 --> 42:23.720
But somehow, you knew Peek was on
Pramipexole, and its side effects.

42:23.720 --> 42:25.520
My late father had Parkinson's.

42:25.520 --> 42:29.080
After George insulted Martin,
all he needed was a nudge.

42:31.680 --> 42:35.160
Which is where he got
the darkroom chemical on him.

42:36.320 --> 42:37.760
And the lipstick.

42:39.880 --> 42:42.400
(YELLS)
So, you lifted his keys,

42:42.400 --> 42:44.560
went to his basement

42:44.560 --> 42:46.960
and put the sinkers in his pistols.

42:48.120 --> 42:50.920
And then it was just a matter
of eliminating Hogarth.

42:50.920 --> 42:53.640
Till you
and your cop friend arrived.

42:54.720 --> 42:56.800
Emeline took care of that problem.

42:58.240 --> 43:00.360
(GRUNTS AND YELLS)

43:05.360 --> 43:08.080
Sounds like I'm the only loose end.

43:09.840 --> 43:11.440
Now you're getting the point.

43:20.680 --> 43:21.960
Ha!

43:34.680 --> 43:37.080
Please. Money's not worth it.

43:37.080 --> 43:38.960
Of course it is!

43:40.720 --> 43:43.680
I found it! I deserve it!

43:43.680 --> 43:46.560
I'm the smart one! Me!

43:47.600 --> 43:48.800
Hey!
(YELLS)

43:48.800 --> 43:51.040
Hey, hey, hey. Oh... Harrow!

43:52.040 --> 43:54.240
Just woke up outside
and I couldn't find you.

43:56.680 --> 43:58.480
Hey, uh...

43:58.480 --> 44:00.160
..is there any more of that beer?

44:06.720 --> 44:10.800
Well, well. The Marquis de Nichols.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.680
I feel a bit iffy.

44:13.680 --> 44:15.360
You'll be alright in the morning.

44:15.360 --> 44:17.920
Hey, did we win?
Yeah.

44:22.720 --> 44:24.640
Ah! Detective Brookes.

44:24.640 --> 44:26.120
Brookesy!

44:26.120 --> 44:28.320
Uh, I believe this is legally yours.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.320
I'd like to open it, please.

44:32.040 --> 44:34.400
Hmm. What did you say it's worth?

44:43.000 --> 44:44.920
Oh, dear.

44:44.920 --> 44:47.720
It's utterly destroyed.

44:47.720 --> 44:51.400
The area under the concrete slab
wasn't properly waterproofed.

44:51.400 --> 44:53.480
(SIGHS)

44:53.480 --> 44:55.920
Luck was no lady tonight.

45:00.560 --> 45:01.800
Look.

45:01.800 --> 45:04.680
A Marshall Sam Colt cereal toy.

45:04.680 --> 45:06.520
I always wanted one of these.

45:06.520 --> 45:09.560
MAN: Good to go?
Get him to St Catherine's.

45:11.400 --> 45:13.320
(CHUCKLES)

45:14.920 --> 45:16.480
Harrow?

45:18.480 --> 45:20.760
I'm glad you weren't lying
about your son.

45:20.760 --> 45:22.760
I thought you were,

45:22.760 --> 45:26.320
and I was thinking I'd have to
go back and take a closer look

45:26.320 --> 45:29.120
at all those other strange things
that were going on around you,

45:29.120 --> 45:33.560
like Chester and...Quinn.

45:36.480 --> 45:39.080
I didn't want to see you
taken away in cuffs.

45:41.760 --> 45:43.440
Me neither.

45:44.680 --> 45:47.400
Think we'll be taking away
your son, though.

45:58.320 --> 46:00.440
(READS SILENTLY)

46:02.280 --> 46:04.200
CALLAN: What are you doing?

46:05.360 --> 46:08.040
Sorry. I didn't hear you come in.
You're in Harrow's email.

46:08.040 --> 46:10.000
Tell me what the hell you're doing.

46:12.560 --> 46:15.160
None of your business.
It is.

46:15.160 --> 46:16.800
He's my girlfriend's father.

46:16.800 --> 46:18.360
He's MY father.

46:20.160 --> 46:21.680
And it's my business.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.800
So, piss off.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.720
(DOOR CLOSES)

47:32.160 --> 47:33.840
No work today?

47:35.440 --> 47:38.040
Did enough damage last night.

47:41.960 --> 47:43.600
Legit.

47:51.560 --> 47:56.120
Did I say what I think I said,
falling asleep the other night?

47:57.560 --> 48:02.480
That you left because you didn't want
him being raised around the dead.

48:05.600 --> 48:08.200
That was not a good reason
to keep him from you.

48:10.880 --> 48:13.120
It was terrible.

48:14.400 --> 48:16.800
I've done terrible things too.

49:17.280 --> 49:18.760
(LOCK BEEPS)

49:54.360 --> 49:56.720
MAN: Z-Stock helpdesk.
How can I help you today?

49:58.520 --> 50:01.200
I'm sorry to hear that
but we can fix that.

50:01.200 --> 50:04.240
I'll just need to take remote control
of your computer, if that's OK?

50:06.640 --> 50:09.040
OK. Thank you.

50:09.040 --> 50:11.080
Lovely family photo.

50:11.080 --> 50:13.720
Is that your grand-daughter?

50:13.720 --> 50:15.880
Now, let me see
if I can find your problem.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.440

MAN: I'll just need to take
remote access of your computer.

50:26.840 --> 50:29.480
Yep. And I've got access now.
Thank you.

50:40.280 --> 50:42.240
Yes.
MAN: You have a problem.

51:04.680 --> 51:06.760
Next, on Harrow...

51:06.760 --> 51:08.920
Your son is playing you.
Cut him off!

51:08.920 --> 51:10.400
He's my son!

51:10.400 --> 51:12.680
The evidence box is available
for collection.

51:12.680 --> 51:14.360
You still want to do this, right?

51:14.360 --> 51:16.200
FERN: Is there a problem?
Wait. Miss.

51:16.200 --> 51:20.160
What have you got Fern involved in?
What are you gonna do - hit me?

51:20.160 --> 51:21.880
Fern's gonna love that.

51:21.880 --> 51:24.920
Mr Palladino and Jade were having
an affair for quite some time.

51:24.920 --> 51:26.920
What does it matter?
Did you kill him

51:26.920 --> 51:29.240
and then strangle your girlfriend?
Did you hurt Jade?

51:29.240 --> 51:30.840
GRACE: He's completely unaffected.

51:30.840 --> 51:33.680
Some people react to death
differently.
