- Bladesmiths, welcome back
to the Forge.

37:29.205 --> 37:30.582
You've had five days
at your home

37:30.582 --> 37:33.877
forges to work
on your jumonji yaris.

37:33.877 --> 37:35.587
Fuad, how did it go?

37:35.587 --> 37:38.173
- Oh, it went really well.

37:38.173 --> 37:40.675
<i>Everything went</i>
<i>according to plan.</i>

37:40.675 --> 37:44.429
<i>I used a lot of two-part</i>
<i>components in my construction,</i>

37:44.429 --> 37:47.265
and I'm very happy
with the overall result.

37:47.265 --> 37:50.852
- Jacob, how did it go for you?
- It went pretty good.

37:50.852 --> 37:53.354
<i>I ran into several</i>
<i>complications,</i>

37:53.354 --> 37:56.191
but overall I think
it went pretty well.

37:56.191 --> 37:57.692
- All right, gentlemen,
now it's time to see

37:57.692 --> 37:59.360
how they hold up
in our weapons tests.

37:59.360 --> 38:02.739
Up first, the kill test. Doug?

38:02.739 --> 38:05.533
<i>- I saw Doug had an injury.</i>
<i>I'm like,</i>

38:05.533 --> 38:07.869
"Well, is he still
gonna test it?"

38:07.869 --> 38:11.706
- The yari with its long handle
and multi-pronged spear

38:11.706 --> 38:16.419
makes it a trifecta of pointed
edges and a deadly weapon.

38:16.419 --> 38:18.880
To see what kind of lethal
damage your weapon will do,

38:18.880 --> 38:21.174
I will take your yari
and deliver multiple slashes

38:21.174 --> 38:23.384
and thrusts on
this pig carcass.

38:23.384 --> 38:24.803
Fuad, you're up first.
Are you ready?

38:24.803 --> 38:26.554
- Oh, I'm ready.

38:26.554 --> 38:29.808
- I see Fuad's yari,
and I'm like, "Wow."

38:29.808 --> 38:31.726
- Unfortunately, you can see
that I'm still recovering

38:31.726 --> 38:33.978
from an injury,
and I'm one arm short,

38:33.978 --> 38:36.898
but to have the pleasure
of doing the kill test,

38:36.898 --> 38:41.194
I'd like to bring back one of
my students of Marcaida Kali.

38:41.194 --> 38:43.863

into weapons testing.

We felt that it had very
good balance through it,

39:43.339 --> 39:48.011

here it dug in into flesh.

39:48.011 --> 39:49.596

39:54.642 --> 39:59.022

cut all the way through.

I would consider
your blade a kill.

However, you're not out

Jacob, your yari still must

Let's see what happens.

In the initial swing, instead
of being able to cut cleanly

41:06.381 --> 41:08.925
with this part to cut through,

41:08.925 --> 41:11.678
this got in the way
with the angle that it had,

41:11.678 --> 41:14.347

these particular blades.

41:14.347 --> 41:17.892
They are sharp enough to
penetrate into the pig carcass.

41:17.892 --> 41:20.311
The thrust is really
devastating

41:20.311 --> 41:22.814

41:22.814 --> 41:28.069
Your handle construction... it

Overall, your weapon will kill.

My yari held up,

41:37.787 --> 41:39.998
- Well, Fuad,
the blades of your yari

41:39.998 --> 41:42.083
were beautifully constructed.

41:42.083 --> 41:44.335
The overall weapon
was very elegant.

41:44.335 --> 41:47.672
However, your shaft broke
in our first test,

41:47.672 --> 41:49.966
and we cannot move forward
in this competition

41:49.966 --> 41:54.053
because that is
a catastrophic weapon failure.

41:54.053 --> 41:57.682
I'm gonna have to ask you
to please leave the Forge.

41:57.682 --> 42:00.101
- I was really confident
going into the competition,

42:00.101 --> 42:02.186
and I felt like my yari

42:02.186 --> 42:05.690
<i>was gonna really perform</i>
<i>a lot better than Jacob's,</i>

42:05.690 --> 42:08.860

<i>it feels pretty bad.</i>

42:23.499 --> 42:25.585

<i>I came here to prove</i>

42:32.592 --> 42:35.678

come out here at 19

42:35.678 --> 42:37.472

serious knife makers.

42:37.472 --> 42:39.223
Thank you, sir.

Really, I would have liked
to beat Fuad

42:40.767 --> 42:42.727
in a different way,

42:42.727 --> 42:47.273
but I'm the "Forged in Fire"
champion; I got $10,000.

42:47.273 --> 42:48.649
