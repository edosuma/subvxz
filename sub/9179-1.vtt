17:50.967 --> 17:53.336
we have green flag wind
conditions this afternoon,

19:07.166 --> 19:08.333
Right. So them
geese are back,

19:08.399 --> 19:10.567
and they've done nasty things
to my grass again.

19:11.066 --> 19:14.969
And they've crapped
over every headstone

Hmm, Do the best
you can with the grass.

Yeah, well, the best
l can do is to shoot
the buggers, Charlie.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.368
You want to run
around Seaside with
a rifle, Alistair?

19:25.466 --> 19:27.301
What about
a high-powered crossbow?

19:28.032 --> 19:30.367
(SIGHS) You remember
Mr. Cosimono?

19:30.466 --> 19:32.868

Yeah, the dead guy,
Yeah.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.668
He's coming up.
Why?

19:36.733 --> 19:41.003
Because the police suspect
his wife may be responsible
for his untimely demise.

l shouldn't laugh.
It's not funny,

it's me and Cindy's

We're going to Maddie's.

Will you actually
ty, though?

'Cause last time
you said you'd try,

19:54.366 --> 19:55.667

did you, Charlie?

19:55.733 --> 19:56.900
You just ended
up staying here.

And this time,
Cindy has arranged
a little friend to meet you.

20:01.666 --> 20:03.534
Are you even listening?
No, of course you're not.

20:03.633 --> 20:06.235
You got that glitch
in the sprinkler system
fixed, didn't you?

20:07.733 --> 20:09.835
That would be a no.
But it's not my
fault this time!

20:09.900 --> 20:11.401
Don't look at me like that.
It's actually not my fault.

20:11.500 --> 20:14.402
l called the sprinkler guy,
and he said he couldn't
come till next week.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.001
So l was like,
''All right, cool.
Come next week,''

20:16.066 --> 20:18.368
But more important,
all right,
listen to me about this.

20:18.466 --> 20:19.867
Cindy's got this
mate over staying,

rough weather last night.

01:05:50.566 --> 01:05:54.002

I can see you
because I can see Sam.

But it's exactly
where she would have been

if she sailed straight
into the storm, Tink!

01:14:03.466 --> 01:14:05.067
She's about to
sail around the world.

01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:07.834
She would have
wanted to test her boat
in heavy weather,

test the boat. Okay?

01:27:06.833 --> 01:27:08.334
lt's mine now.

01:27:08.833 --> 01:27:11.001
They were gonna
strip it for scrap,
so l took it off their hands.

01:27:11.066 --> 01:27:13.802
(EXCLAIMS)
l always loved this boat.

01:27:16.199 --> 01:27:18.301
Well, l'm gonna fix her up,

01:27:18.533 --> 01:27:20.034
make some modifications.

01:27:20.233 --> 01:27:21.634
Oh, yeah? Some flukes?

01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:23.034
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

01:27:23.399 --> 01:27:24.833
Some flukes.

01:27:26.066 --> 01:27:27.667
You know,
that was the last
conversation l had

01:27:27.733 --> 01:27:29.634
before l woke up
in the hospital bed.

01:27:31.399 --> 01:27:32.533
Really?

01:27:32.633 --> 01:27:36.903
Yep. Well, unless you include
Tink's radio chatter.
Which l don't.

01:27:39.066 --> 01:27:40.734
You have a good memory.

01:27:41.366 --> 01:27:44.135
Well, there's one thing
l'll never forget.

01:27:44.199 --> 01:27:47.302
lt's that you saved my life,
Charlie St. Cloud.

01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:54.036
She's a blue-water cruiser.
Where you headed?

01:27:55.366 --> 01:27:56.734
Evermhere.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.235
As soon as she's sound,
l'm gonna sail
around the world,

01:28:04.066 --> 01:28:05.167
Well, good luck.

01:28:08.066 --> 01:28:10.234
Do you want to go
for a spin?

01:28:12.066 --> 01:28:13.367
(CHUCKLES)

01:28:16.166 --> 01:28:17.367
No, not today.

01:28:17.466 --> 01:28:18.567
Come on, Tess.

01:28:18.666 --> 01:28:21.468
You're gonna have to get back
on the water eventually,

01:28:21.533 --> 01:28:23.067
l will. l will.

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:29.036
lt's not the water that
l'm afraid of, Charlie.

01:28:30.466 --> 01:28:31.733
lt's you.

01:28:35.233 --> 01:28:36.233
Me?

01:28:37.032 --> 01:28:38.566
The way you
make me feel.,.

01:28:40.399 --> 01:28:42.634
l don't know,
l've been having
these visions,

01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:44.301
or maybe dreams,

01:28:44.366 --> 01:28:48.069
but they're more
vivid than any dreams
that l've ever had, And.,.

01:28:49.299 --> 01:28:50.800
And you're in them.

01:28:51.633 --> 01:28:53.634
And we're in them, And.,.

01:28:56.967 --> 01:28:58.335
Never mind.

01:28:59.166 --> 01:29:01.167
They're not dreams, Tess.

01:29:01.867 --> 01:29:03.501
They're memories.

01:29:06.399 --> 01:29:08.667
''trust your heart
if the seas catch fire

01:29:08.867 --> 01:29:11.035
"and live by love though
the stars walk backward"

01:29:18.666 --> 01:29:20.534
How did you know that?

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.069
lt's E.E. Cummings,
It was your dad's favorite.

01:29:28.166 --> 01:29:30.201
lt's about taking chances.

01:29:41.166 --> 01:29:43.167
Just take a chance, Tess.

01:29:53.733 --> 01:29:55.367
TESS: My legs are still
a little wobbly.

01:29:55.466 --> 01:29:56.967
No worries.
(TESS EXCLAIMS)

01:30:06.733 --> 01:30:08.134
(CANNON FIRING)

01:30:39.233 --> 01:30:40.634
l miss you.

01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:41.901
(CANNON FIRING)

01:30:43.399 --> 01:30:45.067
SAM: l'm okay, Charlie.

01:30:46.533 --> 01:30:48.835
l'd give anything
for you to see me,

01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:50.501
what l'd have become.

01:30:52.666 --> 01:30:56.069
But no one ever gets to see
what could have been.

01:30:59.566 --> 01:31:01.834
Sorry l had to
break our deal.

01:31:03.733 --> 01:31:05.167
lt was time.

01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:10.003
l mean, it's beyond anything
we ever imagined, Charlie.

01:31:12.399 --> 01:31:14.868
l hurt as bad as
the day you died.

01:31:15.833 --> 01:31:18.068
You hurt because
you're alive,

01:31:35.066 --> 01:31:37.067
We'll always be brothers.

01:31:38.733 --> 01:31:40.000
promise?

01:31:41.366 --> 01:31:42.700
Every day?

01:31:43.066 --> 01:31:46.002
Come rain or shine?
Come hell or high water?

01:32:00.066 --> 01:32:01.400
l promise.

01:32:54.867 --> 01:32:56.335
(PULL MY HEARTAWAY PLAYING)

01:33:13.733 --> 01:33:15.401
l'm gonna pretend
l like that,

01:33:21.199 --> 01:33:22.833
