01:33.987 --> 01:36.007
Dreams are
like stars.

01:36.156 --> 01:38.784
You can't touch them,
but if you follow them,

01:38.858 --> 01:41.918
they will lead you to your destiny.

01:41.995 --> 01:46.261
I used to dream of being the first
dogmonaut to walk on the Moon.

01:47.534 --> 01:50.935
And now, I dream of going home
to my boy, Sasha.

02:24.904 --> 02:27.099
It's incredible.

02:27.173 --> 02:28.470
[groans quietly]

02:28.541 --> 02:30.736
You two astronauts
need to get some sleep.

02:30.810 --> 02:34.041
- You've got a big day tomorrow, Sam.
- It's gonna be the coolest.

02:34.114 --> 02:36.173
I've never seen
a real spaceship before.

02:40.854 --> 02:42.287
[groans]

02:42.355 --> 02:43.913
I wish you could come too.

02:43.990 --> 02:46.584
But I've already asked school
like 12 times.

02:46.659 --> 02:48.752
No pets.

02:51.498 --> 02:53.830
Look, a shooting star, Buddha.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.527
[barks]

02:56.269 --> 02:57.600
Make a wish.

02:59.539 --> 03:02.838
I wish to one day touch the Moon.

03:02.909 --> 03:04.877
Sam, honey, come to bed.

03:06.312 --> 03:07.540
Goodnight, Buddha.

03:08.648 --> 03:09.876
[Buddha groans]

03:09.949 --> 03:13.680
Launch. [mimics rocket]

03:13.753 --> 03:16.153
I wish that all your dreams come true.

03:28.902 --> 03:31.166
Sorry you can't come, Buddha.

03:31.237 --> 03:33.467
Namaste.

03:33.540 --> 03:37.101
Not to worry.
I have a plan of my own.

03:44.417 --> 03:45.475
[whimpers]

03:46.820 --> 03:47.912
[kisses, blows]

03:47.987 --> 03:50.012
- [girl] Catch!
- [groans]

03:50.090 --> 03:51.387
Bye, Rosebud!

03:53.927 --> 03:55.758
Rosebud, where are you?

03:57.630 --> 04:00.758
Come on, sis. I've got a plan
for a rainy day field trip.

04:00.834 --> 04:04.895
Gross! No way I'm going out
in that rain. It'll wreck my furdo.

04:04.971 --> 04:06.268
Come on, let's go!

04:06.339 --> 04:07.431
[Rosebud sighs]

04:13.246 --> 04:15.578
OK, Budderball,
see you after school, big fella.

04:16.649 --> 04:17.741
[groans]

04:21.421 --> 04:22.911
Oh, sweet mama.

04:23.823 --> 04:27.850
[barking]

04:27.927 --> 04:29.258
[Buddha] Psst, Budderball.

04:31.664 --> 04:33.928
We're on a journey
of ginormous proportions.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.764
I'm about to eat some
ginormous proportions myself.

04:36.836 --> 04:38.133
I'll see you guys later.

04:38.204 --> 04:40.729
Budderball, there's no time
for breakfast.

04:40.807 --> 04:43.298
Breakfast is the most important
meal of the day!

04:43.376 --> 04:45.037
[Buddha] Come on!

04:45.111 --> 04:46.305
Oh, bother.

04:48.014 --> 04:49.242
[groans]

04:49.315 --> 04:52.546
[hip-hop music plays]

04:52.619 --> 04:54.314
[music scratches]

04:55.855 --> 04:57.948
[barks]

04:58.024 --> 04:59.286
[boy] A little moonwalk.

04:59.359 --> 05:01.293
[barking]

05:04.531 --> 05:06.328
[groans]

05:07.300 --> 05:08.460
Hit it, B.

05:09.569 --> 05:11.002
[groans]

05:12.672 --> 05:15.641
See ya. I've gotta bounce.
I've got a field trip today.

05:16.876 --> 05:18.969
[humming]

05:22.849 --> 05:25.010
[music continues]

05:27.020 --> 05:30.979
[grunting]

05:32.659 --> 05:34.490
- B-Dawg!
- [gasps]

05:34.561 --> 05:36.859
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

05:36.930 --> 05:40.832
Pshaw. You didn't scare me.
I was just busting a new move.

05:40.900 --> 05:43.368
What's the hip-hop happening,
home dogs?

05:43.436 --> 05:46.837
We're not really sure, but
Buddha sure is excited about it.

05:46.906 --> 05:49.932
All I can say is it's gonna be a blast.

05:51.778 --> 05:54.645
Who put the Red Bull
in Buddha's doggy bowl?

05:55.582 --> 05:57.277
Let's go!

06:09.229 --> 06:10.560
[whimpers]

06:10.630 --> 06:12.222
Not again!

06:12.298 --> 06:15.756
You've gotta have a B-A-T-H
before Mum and Dad see you.

06:15.835 --> 06:17.769
B-A-T-H... [gasps]

06:17.837 --> 06:20.738
You just spelled the B word!

06:21.608 --> 06:23.667
Mudbud, come back!

06:25.578 --> 06:28.240
Dude, step away from the couch.

06:28.314 --> 06:30.145
[whimpers]

06:30.216 --> 06:32.150
[gasps]

06:32.218 --> 06:34.049
[barks]

06:36.990 --> 06:38.014
[both gasp]

06:39.726 --> 06:41.751
- Oh!
- [gasps]

06:41.828 --> 06:43.159
[whimpers]

06:47.900 --> 06:49.492
[barks]

06:54.107 --> 06:55.665
Looks like he got a time out.

06:55.742 --> 06:58.472
When it rains Mudbud gets grounded.

06:58.544 --> 07:00.102
He's a repeat offender.

07:00.179 --> 07:02.739
Remember the time I sampled
the Thanksgiving turkey?

07:02.815 --> 07:04.783
I got a serious time out for that too.

07:04.851 --> 07:08.617
Sample schmample. You ate
the whole Butterball turkey, dawg.

07:08.688 --> 07:11.452
Kind of embarrassing
to be named after a turkey.

07:11.524 --> 07:13.856
Guys, what about Mudbud?

07:15.028 --> 07:16.859
[groans]

07:23.903 --> 07:26.394
Am I ever glad to see you dudes.

07:26.472 --> 07:28.906
Shh. I've gotta jimmy the lock.

07:28.975 --> 07:32.342
Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry.
We might miss it.

07:38.351 --> 07:39.909
[all groan]

07:39.986 --> 07:42.614
- Watch it, dude!
- Move over, guys!

07:44.557 --> 07:46.787
Hurry! There's not a minute to spare!

07:47.627 --> 07:48.821
Oh, yeah!

07:48.895 --> 07:51.022
[Buddha] Come on,
Mudbud, we've gotta go!

07:52.799 --> 07:54.460
[woman] Come along, people!

07:54.534 --> 07:58.595
The launch won't wait on us
if we're tardy now, will it?

07:58.671 --> 08:01.663
The window of opportunity
is upon us. Let's seize it.

08:06.579 --> 08:09.742
[groans]

08:12.251 --> 08:14.947
We are the one lucky Fernfield class

08:15.021 --> 08:17.649
who is going to see a real, live

08:17.724 --> 08:20.454
- spaceship launch.
- [all] Yeah!

08:20.526 --> 08:22.426
So that's where
you're taking us, Buddha?

08:22.495 --> 08:23.587
Surprise!

08:23.663 --> 08:27.690
Vision Enterprises is going to make
space travel available to anyone.

08:27.767 --> 08:31.635
I'm in bagged lunch heaven.
Oh, Mama!

08:31.704 --> 08:33.193
Budderball, quiet!

08:33.272 --> 08:36.571
- [zipper opening]
- [gobbling]

08:38.778 --> 08:41.542
[continues gobbling]

08:42.749 --> 08:45.912
[sneezes]

08:45.985 --> 08:47.782
Oh, my goodness!

08:47.854 --> 08:51.221
My allergy to dander
is really acting up. I...

08:51.290 --> 08:54.418
[sneezes]

09:02.468 --> 09:03.457
Come on.

09:03.536 --> 09:06.562
[squeaks]

09:07.707 --> 09:08.765
Ready, Gravity?

09:10.977 --> 09:13.070
Let's go do this, old buddy.

09:13.146 --> 09:15.478
[clicks teeth]

09:18.217 --> 09:20.412
On behalf of everyone
at Vision Enterprises,

09:20.486 --> 09:23.614
we would like to thank you
for your continued support

09:23.689 --> 09:25.520
on the Vision One project.

09:25.591 --> 09:29.493
And gentlemen, we give you
the Vision One spacecraft.

09:30.830 --> 09:33.094
She's...
she's beautiful, isn't she?

09:33.166 --> 09:34.656
[squeaks]

09:39.705 --> 09:42.868
Uh... The... The Vision One

09:42.942 --> 09:46.742
The... The design is an amalgamation
of an air travel vehicle

09:46.813 --> 09:48.838
and space design rocket.

09:48.915 --> 09:52.043
The vehicle will
comfortably carry two pilots

09:52.118 --> 09:55.178
and four passengers into space.

09:55.254 --> 09:58.746
The Vision One will land on the Moon,

09:58.825 --> 10:02.556
permitting our customers the opportunity

10:02.628 --> 10:05.119
to walk on the surface.

10:05.198 --> 10:07.029
Hi, Finkel.

10:07.099 --> 10:09.590
- Dr. Finkel, nice of you to join us.
- Of course.

10:09.669 --> 10:11.432
Dr. Finkel. Dr. Finkel.

10:13.272 --> 10:15.399
It is my pleasure, Mr. Wolfson,

10:15.475 --> 10:18.308
until you fail and I take over,
of course.

10:18.377 --> 10:19.639
[growls]

10:19.712 --> 10:21.236
Gravity, behave.

10:21.314 --> 10:22.406
[growls]

10:22.482 --> 10:24.416
I don't know what's more unsettling,

10:24.484 --> 10:27.920
that you accessorize
with that brainless rodent,

10:27.987 --> 10:30.114
or that you converse with it too.

10:30.189 --> 10:31.315
[man laughs]

10:31.390 --> 10:32.982
I like ferrets.

10:33.059 --> 10:35.789
I've never been terribly fond
of rats or weasels.

10:36.829 --> 10:38.524
Nothing personal.

10:38.598 --> 10:42.056
Well, out with the old,
in with the new, as they say.

10:42.134 --> 10:46.036
Let's get on with it. Karl, why is
a cappuccino not touching my lips?

10:46.105 --> 10:47.732
- Uh...
- Don't speak.

10:49.308 --> 10:53.335
Uh, let me introduce you
to some members of our team.

10:53.412 --> 10:55.346
<i>[woman's voice]</i>
<i>Fueling in progress.</i>

10:55.414 --> 10:59.282
Uh, Slats Bentley
is our Flight Dynamics Officer.

10:59.352 --> 11:01.650
He will give you some details
on today's mission.

11:01.721 --> 11:04.349
<i>[voice]</i>
<i>Executing override sequence.</i>

11:04.423 --> 11:06.983
...approximately four days
to get to the Moon and back.

11:07.059 --> 11:10.460
Once we land on the surface
we'll stay for 30 minutes,

11:10.530 --> 11:12.862
then re-launch back into space
and head back home.

11:12.932 --> 11:14.490
Good. Uh, over here.

11:14.567 --> 11:17.502
Uh, this is Astro Spaulding.

11:17.570 --> 11:21.028
Uh, she is our pilot for the mission.

11:21.107 --> 11:24.304
The pilot will be flying the spacecraft
using a vectra system,

11:24.377 --> 11:26.868
vision-enabled control
technology response array.

11:26.946 --> 11:31.781
Um, the, uh, systems will be
controlled with the blink of an eye,

11:31.851 --> 11:34.843
It just scans your retina.
It's all hands-free.

11:34.921 --> 11:38.288
I thought there were no life forms
on this mission, not even a pilot.

11:38.357 --> 11:41.724
Astro will remotely pilot
Vision One from Mission Control.

11:41.794 --> 11:46.231
Ultimately, when we begin
commercial travel, uh... uh...

11:46.299 --> 11:48.426
...the remote system
will serve as a backup

11:48.501 --> 11:51.698
in the event of a malfunction
or a pilot illness or...

11:51.771 --> 11:54.433
Sir, there's been a break
in the weather.

11:54.507 --> 11:56.873
Ah, well, excuse us, gentlemen.

11:56.943 --> 11:59.411
Uh, this is our big moment.

12:01.414 --> 12:04.577
Dr. Finkel, could you check and see
if the tour group has arrived,

12:04.650 --> 12:07.881
and then greet them and help
the kids if they have any questions.

12:07.954 --> 12:09.854
Certainly, Mr. Wolfson.

12:10.690 --> 12:11.679
Sir!

12:11.757 --> 12:14.055
[kids shout]

12:16.796 --> 12:18.593
[woman sneezes]

12:18.664 --> 12:22.100
OK, people, off the bus.
Don't forget your lunch...

12:22.168 --> 12:24.261
- [kids scream]
- [screams]

12:26.839 --> 12:28.830
OK, stop right here, kids.

12:28.908 --> 12:32.207
Welcome to Vision Enterprises.
Everyone in. Don't touch anything.

12:32.278 --> 12:34.838
We don't want to miss
the launch. This way!

12:34.914 --> 12:38.111
[woman screams]

12:39.318 --> 12:41.582
My! Oh, dog germs!

12:45.191 --> 12:48.319
Again, please refrain from touching
anything with your hands,

12:48.394 --> 12:51.591
you slimy,
little germ-infested creatures.

12:51.664 --> 12:53.791
OK.

12:53.866 --> 12:56.733
Our goal here, at Vision
Enterprises, for some reason,

12:56.802 --> 13:00.431
is to make space travel
accessible for everyone,

13:00.506 --> 13:03.100
including the family pet.

13:03.175 --> 13:05.234
[Buddha]
Let's hide over there, dudes.

13:05.311 --> 13:07.074
[Rosebud]
Quiet. They'll hear us.

13:07.146 --> 13:08.977
[electronic humming]

13:09.048 --> 13:10.709
<i>[voice] Scanning.</i>

13:10.783 --> 13:13.274
- Wow.
- <i>[voice] Human boy.</i>

13:13.352 --> 13:15.013
This is awesome.

13:22.395 --> 13:27.059
As you can see, we have some
specifically designed space suits.

13:28.734 --> 13:31.362
...and then do whatever you'd like...

13:31.437 --> 13:33.098
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

13:33.172 --> 13:36.471
Please step away from the circle.

13:36.542 --> 13:39.943
That device scans a life form
and determines the right size suit.

13:40.012 --> 13:42.845
It is highly sophisticated.
So please step away.

13:42.915 --> 13:45.748
Can I get a picture with the suit?

13:45.818 --> 13:48.252
No, you cannot have a picture
with the suit.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.151
Please, just take it off immediately.

13:52.591 --> 13:55.890
Uh, all right, you know what?
It's fine, it's fine.

13:55.961 --> 13:59.397
You can keep the suit on.
You probably already contaminated it.

13:59.465 --> 14:01.399
- Just come back to the group.
- Yeah.

14:01.467 --> 14:04.493
Children, this portion of the tour
is over. Please follow me.

14:04.570 --> 14:07.437
Thank you.
Excuse me. Thank you.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.536
[B-Dawg]
Check out the fly gear.

14:11.610 --> 14:13.043
[Rosebud] Oh, my gosh!

14:13.112 --> 14:16.513
These outfits are so to die for.

14:20.753 --> 14:23.051
[Buddha]
Rosebud, where are you going?

14:26.292 --> 14:27.623
<i>[voice] Device on.</i>

14:27.693 --> 14:29.058
<i>Scanning.</i>

14:30.096 --> 14:33.429
- Wow.
- <i>Canine puppy.</i>

14:37.570 --> 14:38.867
Whoa, dudes.

14:45.745 --> 14:47.736
Will one of you boys zip me up?

14:53.119 --> 14:54.814
[groans]

14:55.821 --> 14:57.311
I've gotta try this.

14:57.389 --> 14:58.583
<i>[voice] Scanning.</i>

15:03.963 --> 15:05.760
So, how do I look?

15:05.831 --> 15:08.766
Uh, like our sister in a space suit.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.495
I know I look tight.

15:10.569 --> 15:12.332
[groans]

15:12.404 --> 15:15.498
Mine's a little too tight.
Someone give me a paw.

15:17.276 --> 15:18.800

at the lunch pad for a snack,

15:45.004 --> 15:46.266
if it's on the way.

15:46.338 --> 15:49.330
Budderball, that says "launch pad".

the spacecraft.

Wow. I wish Buddha
was here to see this.

Let's just take a quick look inside,

16:42.228 --> 16:44.253
then we'll come back
and watch the launch.

Do you think it's safe?

a puddle is until you jump in.

16:52.504 --> 16:55.598
Uh... I'll be right back.

have to do with the spaceship?

I would've blinged it out
a little more.

OK, guys, we've seen
the ship. We better go.

17:48.427 --> 17:50.224
Check out these retro shades.

17:50.296 --> 17:52.196
Dude, you shouldn't
be touching those.

17:52.264 --> 17:54.596
I could fly this thing, no problem.

17:54.667 --> 17:56.328
Piece of cake.

17:56.402 --> 17:57.426
Yeah, there's cake.

17:57.503 --> 17:59.061
Ooh, donut!

17:59.138 --> 18:02.232
But I think I'll start with
the chili cheese dog, then steak

18:02.308 --> 18:04.071
and finish with a bean burrito.

18:04.143 --> 18:05.303
[Buddies] No beans!

I want a go or no go for launch.

18:33.172 --> 18:35.140
B-Dawg, what did you press?

18:35.207 --> 18:36.902
I didn't press anything.

18:36.976 --> 18:38.409
- Boosters.
- Go flight.

18:38.477 --> 18:42.538
Budderball, my instincts tell me
you should take a seat, fast!

18:42.614 --> 18:44.741
- But I was just getting to dessert.
- Hurry.

You can say that again.
Even I'm lighter than a feather.

Hmm, it pains me to say this,

22:31.843 --> 22:36.041

option here but to abort the mission.

before we have to abort?

- Approximately ten hours, sir.

Good. Stay on course. Um...

and further away from home.

away from dinner.

23:42.180 --> 23:44.171
I take full responsibility.

figured out a solution.

Great. I... I... knew you would.

24:01.466 --> 24:03.127
Nice work. Let's hear it.

24:03.201 --> 24:08.070
OK, we think that we can refuel at
the old Russian research space station.

24:08.140 --> 24:09.937
But that space station disintegrated

24:10.008 --> 24:12.408
into the Earth's atmosphere
like years ago.

24:12.477 --> 24:15.776
Well, yeah, but you said to check
everything, so I checked everything,

24:15.847 --> 24:19.305
including the conspiracy websites,
which said the station, still in space.

24:19.384 --> 24:22.251
The reason that no one has been
able to find the space station

24:22.321 --> 24:24.585
is because it's not
in it's original position.

24:24.656 --> 24:27.625
Somehow, it has gotten out
of geostationary orbit.

24:27.693 --> 24:29.957

cosmonauts, he survived,

the dirty dude is Mudbud,
the Zen pup is Buddha

29:41.706 --> 29:43.367
and Rosebud is our little sis.

29:43.441 --> 29:46.774
Oh, and, uh, me, I'm Budderball.
And I'm starving.

29:46.845 --> 29:49.541
Nice to meet you.
I'm a Russian dogmonaut.

29:49.614 --> 29:51.878
We kind of got on the ship by accident.

29:51.950 --> 29:54.976
And now, we have no idea where we are.

29:55.053 --> 29:56.918
You're aboard the RRSS,

29:56.988 --> 29:59.752
the old Russian Research Space Station.

29:59.824 --> 30:01.382
You want me to show you around?

30:02.527 --> 30:04.119
Follow me.

30:09.868 --> 30:11.802
In this module, we have our garden,

30:11.870 --> 30:15.169
where we grow all our food in space.

30:15.240 --> 30:19.267
The added benefit is the plants
filter out CO2 gas and produce oxygen.

30:19.344 --> 30:22.677
And we also use them
to create fuel for the station.

30:30.055 --> 30:33.513
Now this joint is
off the chain insane, cuz.

30:33.591 --> 30:35.252
Yes, we've been off the orbital grid

30:35.326 --> 30:37.294
for quite some time,
if that's what you mean.

30:37.362 --> 30:40.695
Over here, we have our solar panels,
which produce all our energy.

30:40.765 --> 30:45.862
So you can keep the stereo
pumpin' 24l7. That's wicked.

30:50.008 --> 30:51.999
Right over here is the kitchen.

30:55.780 --> 30:58.544
[Budderball]
My favorite room in the house.

31:04.189 --> 31:05.213
Huh?

31:06.725 --> 31:08.454
Hmm. Where's the beef?

31:11.362 --> 31:14.024
[bubbling]

31:14.099 --> 31:16.659
- Dude, what is that?
- Space juice.

31:16.735 --> 31:20.193
Pee-yoo! It stinks.
Who'd wanna drink that?

31:20.271 --> 31:23.468
Well, Yuri seems to like it.
And we use it for fuel.

31:23.541 --> 31:24.667
Who's Yuri?

31:24.743 --> 31:26.711
He's the Russian cosmonaut
I live with up here.

31:26.778 --> 31:28.803
How long have you been up here, dude?

31:28.880 --> 31:31.747
Not really sure. It's all
one long night in space.

31:31.816 --> 31:34.842
I was only supposed to be
on this station for a six month mission

31:34.919 --> 31:37.080
but I'm sure it's been years and years.

31:37.155 --> 31:38.281
Spudnick?

31:39.758 --> 31:44.195
Spudnick? Where has
my little puppy puppy gone?

31:44.262 --> 31:45.786
Spudnick...

31:48.299 --> 31:51.268
Yaaa-hoo! [chuckles]

31:54.973 --> 31:56.941
[barking]

31:57.008 --> 31:59.101
Can you believe it, Spudnick?

31:59.177 --> 32:02.476
Our American comrades
have given us a surprise gift!

32:02.547 --> 32:07.280
Five fluffy puppies to keep us
company here in space.

32:07.352 --> 32:09.877
[speaks Russian]
Thank you! Thank you!

32:09.954 --> 32:11.888
He doesn't understand, Spudnick.

32:11.956 --> 32:13.947
We're not staying long.

32:14.025 --> 32:16.357
Where that spaceship goes, we go.

32:16.427 --> 32:18.554
- All right, come on, Spudnick.
- [groans]

32:18.630 --> 32:20.063
Good.

32:20.131 --> 32:24.227
We will finish refueling
and then... we will celebrate.

32:24.302 --> 32:26.270
Dude, you have to help us.

32:26.337 --> 32:28.362
[groans]

32:30.008 --> 32:32.272
[speaks Russian]

32:34.612 --> 32:36.102
Puppy puppies!

32:36.181 --> 32:38.581
Dudes, we've been hoodwinked.

32:38.650 --> 32:42.586
You're telling me!
OK, this food is all vegetables.

32:42.654 --> 32:44.121
Now what?

32:44.189 --> 32:48.057
Uh, we'll be ready to leave
in less than 30 minutes.

32:48.126 --> 32:50.253
The sooner we can get refueled

32:50.328 --> 32:54.230
and get away from this bucket
of bolts the happier I will be.

32:56.868 --> 33:00.429

33:00.505 --> 33:02.564

33:06.344 --> 33:09.905

for eternity and forever.

33:09.981 --> 33:11.312
And to you, Spudnick.

33:11.382 --> 33:13.282
A spaceman's best friend.

33:13.351 --> 33:15.842
And to the new puppy puppies.

33:15.920 --> 33:19.947
We will live together
as a happy family, till the end.

33:20.925 --> 33:22.358
[whimpers]

33:23.628 --> 33:25.391

33:29.901 --> 33:31.926
You want to get the dancing started?

33:32.003 --> 33:33.971
That's a good idea, Spudnick.

33:34.038 --> 33:36.302
Let's get jiggle with it.

- The dog's down for the count.

these space nachos are gnarly.

- He's asleep.

This is my last chance
to go home to my boy, Sasha.

is to go down with the ship.

37:33.177 --> 37:37.204
I hope I never need it,
but better safe than sorry.

Refueling is complete.
Can we disconnect the ship?

- I have no idea, sir.

Good idea, 'cause I've gotta
take a whiz something fierce.

46:39.857 --> 46:42.052
Well, let's suit up.

[squeaks]

47:51.528 --> 47:53.894

There's some sort of four-legged
creatures surrounding the ship.

48:00.704 --> 48:04.504
Sir, I think we've discovered
alien life forms.

OK, uh, Chuck,
zoom in on that, would ya?

48:07.578 --> 48:10.012

I don't think it's cheese,
but I don't even care.

Ah, so maybe Yuri
wasn't so crazy after all.

48:51.188 --> 48:54.021

49:55.085 --> 49:56.882
How does something like this happen?

And more importantly, how on earth
are we going to bring them home?

50:00.190 --> 50:03.990
Yeah, leaving five puppies on the Moon,
it's not real good for PR.

50:04.061 --> 50:06.325
No, it is certainly not.

50:06.396 --> 50:08.489
We could run an ad campaign.

50:08.565 --> 50:09.964
- Oh.
- Let me see.

50:10.033 --> 50:11.466
Fly with us,

we launched six poor
innocent puppies into space

50:16.306 --> 50:19.503
and then bid them farewell
for eternity.

50:19.576 --> 50:22.477
The bottom line is
we can't leave them there.

50:22.546 --> 50:25.913
How do you plan on coaxing
a bunch of moronic animals

Dude, there's no aliens.

I mean, I need full confidentiality
on this. If this story were to leak,

59:32.429 --> 59:36.126
[squeaks] Buddies, the Vision One
has been struck by a meteor.

59:40.136 --> 59:42.366
All our system tests confirm

59:42.439 --> 59:45.067
that the data communication
antenna is damaged.

59:45.141 --> 59:47.200
All we have left is
audio communication

59:47.277 --> 59:48.869
and that doesn't help us at all.

59:48.945 --> 59:50.276
And the only way to fix it,

59:50.346 --> 59:52.678
is for an astronaut to do it externally.

59:53.416 --> 59:55.850
[squeaking]

59:55.919 --> 59:59.116
We're gonna need one of you
to do a spacewalk to fix the damage.

59:59.189 --> 01:00:01.316
Without the data communication antenna

01:00:01.391 --> 01:00:03.359
<i>we can't control the ship from Earth.</i>

01:00:03.426 --> 01:00:05.121
Roger that, Mission Control.

01:00:05.195 --> 01:00:08.562
I should go. I've been in space
the longest and know this stuff well.

01:00:08.631 --> 01:00:11.794
Dude, if something happens
to you, we're all doomed.

01:00:11.868 --> 01:00:15.736
I'll do it! The sooner we get home,
the sooner I'll get some food.

01:00:15.805 --> 01:00:17.397
I was just gonna raise my paw.

01:00:17.474 --> 01:00:19.942
But, you beat me to it, dawg.

01:00:20.009 --> 01:00:22.569
As far as we can tell,
all the functions of the Vision One

01:00:22.645 --> 01:00:25.045
are normal and the hull is intact
but its telemetry

01:00:25.114 --> 01:00:27.844
has been diverted
and it's way off course

01:00:27.917 --> 01:00:30.545
and our re-entry angle
is dangerously shallow.

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.918
The Vision One could skip off
into the atmosphere

01:00:32.989 --> 01:00:34.388
and tumble out into space.

01:00:38.862 --> 01:00:41.353
- Oh.
- [sighs]

01:00:43.433 --> 01:00:47.267
Well, for the sake
of those five kids...

01:00:47.337 --> 01:00:49.237
...we cannot give up.

01:00:51.741 --> 01:00:53.971
We can't.

01:00:57.514 --> 01:00:59.812
The puppies along
with their Russian comrade

01:00:59.883 --> 01:01:01.908

To control your movement,
you have four small jets.

01:01:31.047 --> 01:01:33.038
Move your right hind leg, you go back.

01:01:33.116 --> 01:01:35.380
Move your left hind leg,
you go forward.

Wiggle your right front paw,
you go left.

Your left front paw, you go right.

01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:40.984
Look, you'll be tethered to the ship

01:01:41.057 --> 01:01:43.719
so you don't float off
into outer space. Got it?

01:01:43.793 --> 01:01:46.387
Uh, which one is my left paw again?

01:01:46.462 --> 01:01:47.622
We're doomed.

01:01:47.697 --> 01:01:50.097
What? It's not my fault I'm dyslexic!

01:01:50.166 --> 01:01:53.795
Just remember, your right back leg,
you lift to take a wizzo.

01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:56.566
Left back, you use
to scratch your tummy.

01:01:56.639 --> 01:01:59.437
Left front paw,
you use to beg for food.

01:01:59.509 --> 01:02:02.307
And the right front paw,
is for snackin'.

01:02:02.378 --> 01:02:05.245
OK, scratch, forward.
Wizzo equals backwards.

01:02:05.315 --> 01:02:07.180
Begging, go right
and snacking go left.

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:08.808
See, I got it.

01:02:08.885 --> 01:02:11.547
The target is a data
communications antenna.

01:02:11.621 --> 01:02:13.179
Place it back into position

01:02:13.256 --> 01:02:16.089
<i>and we should be able</i>
<i>to control the ship again.</i>

01:02:16.159 --> 01:02:19.390
Budderball, did you eat
all the bean burritos?

01:02:19.462 --> 01:02:21.692
What can I say?
I'm a nervous eater.

01:02:21.764 --> 01:02:24.927
And walking in space
makes me especially nervous.

01:02:50.593 --> 01:02:53.756
Oh, sweet mama. This is beautiful.

01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:56.060

01:03:09.679 --> 01:03:10.771
Oh, right!

01:03:16.719 --> 01:03:20.485
All this talk about scratching,
and now I've got an itch.

01:03:20.556 --> 01:03:22.319
Budderball, don't scratch.

01:03:22.392 --> 01:03:24.292
But, it's so itchy.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.920
If you scratch,
you'll spin out of control.

01:03:26.996 --> 01:03:29.396
I can't help myself.

01:03:29.465 --> 01:03:30.989
Don't do it, dawg.

01:03:31.067 --> 01:03:32.967

01:03:33.036 --> 01:03:34.094
Budderball, no!

01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:36.161
Oh, mama. Ah!

I swear. Cross my stomach

01:04:20.917 --> 01:04:22.544
Now what are we gonna do?

01:04:22.618 --> 01:04:26.019
I got it! Budderball just ate
a dozen bean burritos, right?

01:04:26.089 --> 01:04:28.319
Dude, this is no time to be cryptic.

01:04:28.391 --> 01:04:30.291

01:05:08.765 --> 01:05:11.825
OK, now the methane gas

01:10:00.122 --> 01:10:02.147
He must have had an escape pod.

01:10:02.224 --> 01:10:04.454
My Cosmopod is not irresponsible.

01:10:04.527 --> 01:10:06.222
- Slats, any ideas.
- Negative, sir.

01:10:06.295 --> 01:10:08.058
The Russian pod is out of control.

01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:09.654
It's entering the atmosphere

01:10:09.732 --> 01:10:11.757
at a dangerous entry level
at high speed.

01:10:11.834 --> 01:10:14.325
It's pretty much
an impossible rescue, sir.

01:10:14.403 --> 01:10:18.533
Yuri will burn up, if you don't
change his trajectory.

01:10:18.607 --> 01:10:21.371
- I'm taking over.
- Whoa, I've lost control.

01:10:21.444 --> 01:10:25.005
I'm going to have to dodge
the Cosmopod to change it's course.

01:10:25.081 --> 01:10:27.549
Let's do it, dude. I mean, comrade.

01:10:27.616 --> 01:10:29.607
Hang on!

01:10:39.829 --> 01:10:41.490
All right, we've made contact.

01:10:41.564 --> 01:10:44.761
It's crucial you level off
the Cosmopod at 30 degrees.

01:10:44.834 --> 01:10:48.167
Give me a countdown on re-entry.
I'll pull up at the last second.

01:10:48.237 --> 01:10:53.573
In six, five, four, three, two, one...

01:10:53.642 --> 01:10:54.939
...activate thrusters.

01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:56.739
[zooms]

01:11:00.683 --> 01:11:02.583
<i>[voice] Course corrected.</i>

01:11:02.651 --> 01:11:04.084
How did they know to level off

01:11:04.153 --> 01:11:06.621
the Russian escape pod
to those exact coordinates.

01:11:06.689 --> 01:11:08.281
[squeaks]

01:11:08.357 --> 01:11:10.484
- [man] Eyes on scopes, people.
- [squeaks]

01:11:12.128 --> 01:11:13.152
[grunts]

01:11:14.463 --> 01:11:15.452
Whoa!

01:11:17.032 --> 01:11:18.556
You guys ready to go home?

01:11:18.634 --> 01:11:20.761
Yo, dawg, I was born ready.

01:11:20.836 --> 01:11:23.805
All right, my friends,
I'm relinquishing controls.

01:11:23.873 --> 01:11:26.398
- [powers down]
- <i>[voice] Remote activated.</i>

01:11:26.475 --> 01:11:29.444
- Hey, I got control back.
- <i>[voice 2] Remote pilot engaged.</i>

01:11:31.247 --> 01:11:34.739
Well, let's bring this puppy home.
Uh, puppies, that is.

01:11:34.817 --> 01:11:38.913
The re-entry sequence
in three, two, one.

01:11:38.988 --> 01:11:41.115
[rumbling]

01:11:49.198 --> 01:11:51.223
We've lost them in the blackout zone.

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:55.737
We won't have a visual
for T-minus four minutes.

01:11:58.641 --> 01:11:59.733
[squeaks]

01:12:03.245 --> 01:12:04.837
It's out of our hands.

01:12:04.914 --> 01:12:09.010
Now, uh, we can't do anything
but hope for the best.

01:12:19.562 --> 01:12:21.359
[squeaks]

01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:24.024
The spacecraft has
re-entered the atmosphere

01:12:24.099 --> 01:12:26.590
and is now hurdling
mercilessly towards Earth.

01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:29.968
<i>[reporter] Communication</i>
<i>is now in the blackout zone.</i>

01:12:30.039 --> 01:12:34.499

01:12:34.577 --> 01:12:37.444
All of us here
at Channel Four Fernfield,

01:12:37.513 --> 01:12:40.607
<i>along with the world,</i>
<i>collectively hold our breath,</i>

01:12:40.683 --> 01:12:44.016

01:12:44.086 --> 01:12:46.850
<i>that the puppies, our space heroes,</i>

01:12:46.922 --> 01:12:51.655

01:12:51.727 --> 01:12:53.786
All we can do is pray.

01:12:57.266 --> 01:13:00.497
Please protect Spudnick
and his friends.

01:13:02.104 --> 01:13:03.969
[beeping]

01:13:04.039 --> 01:13:06.200

[zooming]

01:13:08.744 --> 01:13:11.406
- [voice] Re-entry successful.
- OK, we have visual, people.

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:13.710
Buddies, we did it!

01:13:13.782 --> 01:13:16.342
[cheering]

01:13:17.119 --> 01:13:19.178
[all] Whoo!

01:13:19.255 --> 01:13:20.517
- [squeaks]
- [all] Yeah!

01:13:20.589 --> 01:13:22.250
Whoo!

01:13:22.324 --> 01:13:24.383
See, space travel ain't nothing.

01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:27.190
- [sputters]
- [B-Dawg] Whoa!

01:13:27.263 --> 01:13:28.389
What was that?

01:13:28.464 --> 01:13:29.829
That was a sonic boom.

01:13:29.898 --> 01:13:32.230
We just broke the sound barrier.

01:13:32.301 --> 01:13:35.930
I knew that.
I was just joshing you, dawg.

01:13:37.606 --> 01:13:39.631
[man] Engaging landing sequence.

01:13:40.442 --> 01:13:41.670
Good job, Astro.

01:13:48.484 --> 01:13:49.781

01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:56.521
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:13:56.592 --> 01:13:59.152
- We're home!
- Congratulations, dogs.

01:13:59.228 --> 01:14:01.355
- You did it.
- [laughing]

01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:03.830
[cheering]

01:14:05.334 --> 01:14:06.926

01:14:07.002 --> 01:14:08.697
Yes! They made it!
[guffaws]

01:14:08.771 --> 01:14:12.832

01:14:23.385 --> 01:14:25.353
- [B-Dawg] Touchdown!
- [Rosebud] Way to go, guys.

01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:35.125
I have a feeling, you and your
furry friends had more to do

01:14:35.197 --> 01:14:38.655
with this mission's success
than we will ever know.

01:14:38.734 --> 01:14:40.497
Come on, come on.

01:14:40.569 --> 01:14:42.833
[squeaking]

01:14:45.507 --> 01:14:48.271
Come on, kids,
let's go greet the new heroes.

01:14:48.344 --> 01:14:49.333
- Let's go.
- Come on!

01:14:49.411 --> 01:14:50.935
- Yeah!

Here you go, Gravity,
greet your new friends.

01:15:12.901 --> 01:15:16.564
[squeaking]

01:15:22.411 --> 01:15:25.312
Welcome home, Buddies.
Spudnick, that was some fancy

01:15:25.381 --> 01:15:27.679
seat-of-the-pants aviation
you demonstrated.

01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:29.718
Whoa, you're a ferret?

01:15:29.785 --> 01:15:31.776
Yo, dawg, you mean to tell me

01:15:31.854 --> 01:15:34.687
we had a rodent
as our flight director?

01:15:34.757 --> 01:15:35.849
Hey, I'm not a rodent.

01:15:35.924 --> 01:15:38.085
I'm related to the mustela
family of mammals,

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.526
which includes minks and skunks.

01:15:40.596 --> 01:15:43.190
Hey, I'm told I'm related to skunks too.

01:15:43.265 --> 01:15:45.995
We couldn't have made it home
without your help, Gravity.

01:15:46.068 --> 01:15:47.126
Thank you, comrade.

01:15:47.202 --> 01:15:48.430

Rosebud! Mudbud!

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:01.413
- B-Dawg! B-Dawg!
- Namaste Buddha!

01:16:01.483 --> 01:16:04.884
[laughs] Hey!
Oh, I'm so happy you're home.

01:16:04.953 --> 01:16:07.683
- [laughing]
- [squeaks]

01:16:07.756 --> 01:16:12.193
- [laughing] Yeah.
- B-Dawg! B-Dawg!

01:16:12.261 --> 01:16:15.321
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:16:15.397 --> 01:16:17.558
Oh, and one last thing...

01:16:17.633 --> 01:16:21.262
It seems a boy named Sasha
is trying to contact you.

01:16:21.336 --> 01:16:22.428
Really?

01:16:22.504 --> 01:16:23.937
He's been waiting for you.

01:16:25.641 --> 01:16:29.202
Oh, hey, hey. Oh.

01:16:29.278 --> 01:16:31.769
Where am I? What?

01:16:33.916 --> 01:16:35.679
Mother Russia.

01:16:35.751 --> 01:16:39.243
[laughing]

01:16:41.457 --> 01:16:46.019
How are you? Nice to see you.
I come from space.

01:16:46.094 --> 01:16:48.085
How are you?

01:16:49.431 --> 01:16:53.390
[cheering]

01:17:13.489 --> 01:17:17.220
This is more like it.
I feel much prettier in pink.

01:17:19.194 --> 01:17:21.253
Aw!

01:17:32.608 --> 01:17:35.577
[harmonica sounding]

01:17:40.249 --> 01:17:41.876
[music stops]

01:17:43.752 --> 01:17:47.244
Uh, thank you.
Thank you for being here.

01:17:47.322 --> 01:17:50.587
I would like to present wings,

01:17:50.659 --> 01:17:55.096
the symbol of true heroism in space...

01:17:55.163 --> 01:17:56.687
...to our dogmonauts.

01:17:56.765 --> 01:17:59.165
[cheering]

01:17:59.234 --> 01:18:01.361
Here they are. The Space Buddies.

01:18:01.436 --> 01:18:04.564
[cheering]

01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:09.336
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:18:09.411 --> 01:18:11.845
- [laughing]
- Yeah!

01:18:11.914 --> 01:18:14.178
Ah! Rosebud.

01:18:14.249 --> 01:18:16.376
Congratulations.

01:18:16.451 --> 01:18:17.679
And B-Dawg.

01:18:19.621 --> 01:18:21.555
Budderball.

01:18:21.623 --> 01:18:23.853
[laughing]

01:18:23.926 --> 01:18:26.360
Ah, Mudbud. [chuckles]

01:18:26.428 --> 01:18:28.020
I'm gonna miss Spudnick.

01:18:28.096 --> 01:18:31.554
Spudnick is now officially
part of my entourage.

01:18:31.633 --> 01:18:34.727
I'll never forget he taught me
to eat my vegetables.

01:18:34.803 --> 01:18:36.896
He was a rad comrade.

01:18:36.972 --> 01:18:39.634
He'll have a space
in our hearts forever.

01:18:39.708 --> 01:18:43.007
[cheering]

01:18:50.319 --> 01:18:51.650

01:18:54.122 --> 01:18:55.714

01:18:55.791 --> 01:18:57.691
[Sasha laughs]

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:06.328
Spudnick!

01:19:11.273 --> 01:19:14.242
[clapping]

01:19:14.309 --> 01:19:15.708
[whimpers]

01:19:15.777 --> 01:19:18.837
I always dreamt I'd hold you
in my arms again.

01:19:18.914 --> 01:19:20.472
Aw.

01:19:32.194 --> 01:19:35.186
[crickets chirping]

01:19:47.943 --> 01:19:49.672
Whoa.

01:19:52.848 --> 01:19:54.611
This rock.

01:19:55.684 --> 01:19:57.948
Is from the Moon?

01:19:58.020 --> 01:19:59.612
[barks]

01:20:02.624 --> 01:20:05.092
I got to touch the Moon too.

01:20:08.230 --> 01:20:10.960
I guess dreams really do come true.

01:20:25.647 --> 01:20:29.413
I fulfilled my dream of being the first
dogmonaut to walk on the Moon.

01:20:29.484 --> 01:20:33.386
But in returning home,
I realized it is the journey

01:20:33.455 --> 01:20:36.913
and the new friendships
I made that matter the most.
