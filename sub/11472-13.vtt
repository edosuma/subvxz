WEBVTT

00:13.614 --> 00:14.648
What is this?

00:14.681 --> 00:16.149
Creamed spinach.

00:18.318 --> 00:19.319
Mm.

00:21.522 --> 00:22.589
And what is this?

00:22.623 --> 00:24.324
That's Salisbury steak.

00:26.059 --> 00:28.762
What makes that different
from the regular steak?

00:28.795 --> 00:29.963
I don't know.

00:29.996 --> 00:31.965
The Salisbury sauce,
I suppose.

00:31.998 --> 00:33.333
You want some?

00:34.735 --> 00:35.802
Uh...

00:35.836 --> 00:37.771
Nikolai, it's time to go.
Let's go.

00:39.439 --> 00:41.908
You know, I always
notice that...

00:41.942 --> 00:43.677
the day after we have
Salisbury steak,

00:43.710 --> 00:45.245
we always have hamburgers.

00:45.278 --> 00:46.980
But then the day
after that,

00:47.013 --> 00:49.049
we always have
meatball heroes.

00:49.082 --> 00:52.118
And a few days after that,
we have meatloaf.

00:53.186 --> 00:55.455
So is it the same meat?

00:55.488 --> 00:56.356
Are you guys...

00:56.389 --> 00:58.959
Are you guys
recycling the meat?

00:58.992 --> 01:00.493
It's different meat.

01:01.628 --> 01:03.597
Yeah, well...

01:03.630 --> 01:06.032
I guess you would have
to say that, right?

01:06.066 --> 01:07.868
(SIGHS)

01:07.901 --> 01:09.770
I'll have
the Salisbury steak, please.

01:11.004 --> 01:12.773
Excellent choice, sir.

01:13.106 --> 01:14.140
Thanks.

01:14.174 --> 01:16.242
Daniel: All right.
Yum‐yum.

01:19.279 --> 01:21.648
Some Salisbury dog meat
for us, please.

01:23.049 --> 01:24.350
Hey, Nick.

01:24.384 --> 01:25.251
Hey.

01:25.285 --> 01:26.486
Where have you been?

01:26.520 --> 01:27.688
You told me we were
going to Denny's.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.455
I was waiting for you
in the parking lot.

01:30.156 --> 01:31.892
Did I say that?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.660
Yeah.
After third period.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.196
Third period?

01:36.229 --> 01:38.098
In the hallway
at my locker.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.201
Oh, yeah.

01:41.234 --> 01:43.436
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

01:43.469 --> 01:45.639
Well, do you still
want to go, or...

01:46.272 --> 01:47.641
You're already eating.

01:50.243 --> 01:51.344
Yeah, but that's ok.

01:51.377 --> 01:53.680
I could eat again.
I'm kinda hungry.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.749
You're kinda stoned.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.751
I'm very stoned.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.254
Report cards come out
in, like, two weeks,

02:01.287 --> 02:03.924
so I thought I'd try
to have some fun

02:03.957 --> 02:06.326
before the whip comes down.
You know?

02:07.460 --> 02:08.461
Forget it.

02:13.166 --> 02:14.367
What's wrong
with Lindsay?

02:15.435 --> 02:17.571
I don't know, man.
She's crazy.

02:25.178 --> 02:26.379
NICK: Hey.

02:27.213 --> 02:29.315
So?
I don't have any in yet.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.152
The town can't be
totally dry, Mark.

02:32.185 --> 02:33.219
That's sick. Come on.

02:33.253 --> 02:34.420
It happens.

02:34.454 --> 02:36.222
Don't worry.
I'll get you some.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.459
Don't you grow your own?

02:39.492 --> 02:40.326
No.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.528
That's‐‐you are so
full of it.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.996
I know that
you grow your own.

02:43.029 --> 02:44.698
Tommy Genaro told me
that it was amazing.

02:44.731 --> 02:45.566
That's a lie.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.067
My dad found
my grow lights,

02:47.100 --> 02:48.835
and he ran over them
with his car.

02:51.905 --> 02:52.906
He better have.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.143
(SIGH)

02:57.177 --> 02:58.945
The customer
is king, Mark.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.514
The customer
is king.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.283

04:13.053 --> 04:14.855
Ah, that's it.
Ok, great.

04:15.321 --> 04:16.523
Thank you, Sam.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.291
Oh, Lindsay,

04:18.324 --> 04:20.761
the Johnsons want you
to babysit on Thursday.

04:20.794 --> 04:21.962
What do they pay?

04:21.995 --> 04:23.597
$1.50 an hour.

04:23.630 --> 04:26.366
That's all?
They're so cheap.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.401
Yes, Lindsay, they should
pay you a king's ransom

04:28.434 --> 04:30.270
to lay around
drinking pop

04:30.303 --> 04:31.772
and watching TV
on their couch.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.307
What, am I supposed
to work for slave wages?

04:34.340 --> 04:35.942
I guess keeping their kid
safe and secure

04:35.976 --> 04:37.243
isn't worth
that much to them.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.780
All right. Enough already.
Everybody be quiet.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.748
I'm trying to watch
<i>Charlie's Angels.</i>

04:49.489 --> 04:51.925
Sam, who's your
favorite Angel?

04:51.958 --> 04:53.794
I like Bosley.

04:54.595 --> 04:55.461
Bosley?

04:55.495 --> 04:57.564
Nobody watches
this show for Bosley.

04:58.364 --> 04:59.766
He's funny.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.502
Yeah? Well, he's
no Kate Jackson,

05:01.535 --> 05:03.036
I'll tell you
that much.

05:03.069 --> 05:04.170
He doesn't care.

05:04.204 --> 05:05.939
He's in love
with Cindy Sanders.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.642
No, not anymore.

05:08.675 --> 05:11.077
She's going out
with Todd Schellinger.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.346
Aw. Well,
it's her loss, honey.

05:13.379 --> 05:15.381
She's the one
missing out.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.984
Well, has anybody else
caught your fancy?

05:18.018 --> 05:19.119
Dad!

05:19.152 --> 05:20.954
Hey, stop,
you're embarrassing him.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.390
Well, I just think
there comes a time
in a young man's life

05:24.424 --> 05:26.793
when he should begin
testing the waters.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.095
What about me
testing the waters?

05:30.196 --> 05:32.198
You can test
the waters, too...

05:32.232 --> 05:33.734
after you get married.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.274
Oh, did you hear?

05:41.307 --> 05:43.844
Freshman student government
voted Cindy and Todd
"cutest couple."

05:43.877 --> 05:46.880
Aw, man! When is she
gonna break up with him?

05:46.913 --> 05:49.616
I thought jocks are always
dumping their girlfriends.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.085
Sam, it may
very well be time
to admit to yourself

05:52.118 --> 05:53.620
that the Cindy ship
has sailed.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.722
It's time to board
another vessel.

05:55.756 --> 05:56.990
Another what?

05:58.058 --> 05:59.760
Hey! My new binder.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.765
Mm! New tri‐fold
organizer.

06:04.798 --> 06:05.766
Very impressive.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.001
I have one of those
babies myself.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.503
Could you please watch
where you're going?

06:09.536 --> 06:11.404
Oh, it would be
my pleasure.

06:11.437 --> 06:13.206
Hey, Sam.
Hey, guys.

06:13.239 --> 06:14.474
Hey, Maureen.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.276
Did you guys do the reading
for social studi‐‐

06:16.309 --> 06:17.578
Maureen, come on,
let's go.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.113
Ok.

06:20.146 --> 06:22.048
Um, I'll see you guys
in class.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.584
See ya.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.285
See, Sam? Those are
the kinda women

06:25.318 --> 06:26.720
we should be
going for.

06:26.753 --> 06:28.288
The Cindy Sanders
of this world

06:28.321 --> 06:30.390
are just... hors d'oeuvres.

06:30.423 --> 06:32.158
Vicki is a five‐course meal.

06:32.926 --> 06:33.960
Hor what?

06:34.795 --> 06:36.029
KID: Hey, Bill.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.231
Bill, you want
some crushed nuts
with your sundae?

06:38.264 --> 06:39.465
My what?

06:39.966 --> 06:41.401
Ohh!

06:44.771 --> 06:46.673
That guy needs
a new joke.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.241
For the next week,
we're going to be talking

06:48.274 --> 06:50.243
about the civil
rights movement.

06:50.276 --> 06:51.812
So that should be fun,

06:51.845 --> 06:54.347
'cause that was
a really exciting time.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.282
Now, most people think of
Martin Luther King Jr.

06:56.316 --> 06:58.351
when they talk
about this time,

06:58.384 --> 07:00.420
but the movement was
sparked by one woman

07:00.453 --> 07:03.189
who refused to give up
her seat on a public bus.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.926
Does anyone
know her name?

07:05.959 --> 07:07.528
Rosa Parks.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.863
That's right, Bill.
Very good.

07:11.364 --> 07:12.766
Ah‐choo!

Whoa. God bless you,
Miss Foote.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.370
Thank you.

07:17.403 --> 07:21.608
Ah. My allergies are
really acting up today.

07:23.309 --> 07:24.778
Yeah. Mine, too.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.379
Do you want me
to close the window?

07:26.412 --> 07:27.681
No. Thank you, Bill.

07:31.818 --> 07:33.353
What are you
allergic to, Bill?

07:33.386 --> 07:35.355
Well, a lot of things
are on that list,

07:35.388 --> 07:39.359
like bees and air
and cats and dogs.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.261
Well, not dogs.
Well, some dogs.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.263
If I eat a peanut,
I could die.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.898
Wow. Really?

07:44.931 --> 07:46.933
Yeah. It happened once
in summer camp,

07:46.967 --> 07:50.136
and I had to be taken away
in an ambulance.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.437
So don't eat 'em, dork.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.273
(CLASS LAUGHS)

07:53.306 --> 07:55.709
I don't. If I did,
I could die.

07:55.742 --> 07:58.111
You know, Bill,
that's really unusual.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.013
Not really.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.248
I mean, a lot of people
have ailments like that.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.718
Like... Like, Neal
has psoriasis,

08:04.751 --> 08:06.052
which is like lizard skin.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.021
(LAUGHTER)

08:09.089 --> 08:10.791

08:10.824 --> 08:12.325

about blood.

08:12.358 --> 08:14.160

08:16.897 --> 08:17.931
Ok. So...

I can't believe you.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.302

08:22.335 --> 08:23.670
We're finally starting
to get some respect
around here,

08:23.704 --> 08:25.038
and you had
to go ruin it.

08:25.071 --> 08:27.073
How are we gonna get in
with Maureen and her friends

08:27.107 --> 08:29.810
if you tell the whole class
about my fainting,

08:29.843 --> 08:32.278
your dumb allergies,
and Neal's lizard skin?

08:32.312 --> 08:33.614
Hey. It's called
psoriasis,

08:33.647 --> 08:35.716
and 10% of the population
will suffer from it

08:35.749 --> 08:37.117
at some point
in their life.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.318
What's the big deal?

08:38.351 --> 08:39.786
It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.722
You were too busy
flirting with Miss Foote

08:41.755 --> 08:43.624
to realize you were
making fools out of us.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.391
I was not flirting
with Miss Foote.

08:45.425 --> 08:48.529
And you're killing
my chances with Vicki.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.597
You don't have
a chance with Vicki.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.165
You don't have a chance
with Miss Foote.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.367
I got a better chance
with Miss Foote than
you have with Vicki,

08:54.400 --> 08:55.536
and I don't have
a chance at all.

08:55.569 --> 08:58.038
Fine, Bill. Be a geek
your whole life.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.072
I'm sick of it.

You always have pot, man.

Daniel, don't be
a cheap bastard.

a joint in your life.

It's really uncool
if you guys are
holding out on me.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.095
I'm gonna
kill Mark.

into a wastebasket.

on him.

Well, here's a plan.

How about, you know,
instead of letting
that go to waste,

10:27.661 --> 10:29.495
you donate it
to a worthy cause.

10:29.530 --> 10:31.131

give it to me?

in my office.

ferns last night.

on eye drops.

that big a deal.

his work with the peanut.

mortal enemy.

11:47.774 --> 11:49.075

11:49.109 --> 11:51.044
Because you're allergic
to peanuts.

I just don't like
you talking so much
about my allergies.

look like a geek.

science fiction.

or should mine?

should drive

19:53.927 --> 19:55.829
Oh, hell, yeah.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.731
I saw them
at the Pyramids.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.032
The Egyptian pyramids?

19:59.065 --> 20:03.203
Uh, I don't think
they've ever played
the Pyramids.

20:03.737 --> 20:04.738
Oh, yeah.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.439
You're right.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.942
It was The Dead.

20:08.975 --> 20:13.046
I just got confused
because I was thinking
of another guy

20:13.079 --> 20:14.748
I went to both shows with,
you know?

20:14.781 --> 20:15.849
His name was Tim.

20:17.283 --> 20:19.553
Hey, I saw Floyd
at the Laser Dome.

20:20.754 --> 20:23.489
They weren't there,
but it was their music.

20:28.294 --> 20:30.230
Well, thanks
for lunch, Frank.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.364
Definitely, Jeff.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.766
We'll do it again soon.
Absolutely.

20:33.266 --> 20:34.367
See you, guys.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.402
Shine on,
you crazy diamonds.

20:37.871 --> 20:38.905
All right.

20:41.307 --> 20:43.910
Daniel. Ken,
have a seat.

20:48.549 --> 20:49.983
That was for your benefit.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.417
I want you
to remember that man.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.352
Why?

20:52.385 --> 20:55.155
'Cause he's fried
out of his mind.

20:55.188 --> 20:56.590
He's Mr. Wake and Bake.

20:57.591 --> 20:59.325
So?
He's your future.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.661
Keep burning the bong
at both ends,

21:00.694 --> 21:02.829
and you'll wind up
just like him.

21:02.863 --> 21:04.698
Mr. Rosso,
I told you.

21:04.731 --> 21:06.867
I was just trying
to get rid of my weed.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.604
How dumb do I look?

21:10.637 --> 21:12.372
Do you really
want to know?

21:12.405 --> 21:14.741
I could have you
expelled for this,

21:14.775 --> 21:16.442
but I'm gonna
give you a break.

21:17.210 --> 21:18.712
Learn from Frank...

21:19.780 --> 21:21.347
Or you'll be Frank.

21:21.982 --> 21:23.049
It's your choice.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.185
Right.

21:25.218 --> 21:27.153
Do we understand
each other?

that's possible.

What if Bill's ghost
starts to haunt us?

Then he'll come into
our rooms at night

22:30.116 --> 22:31.918
and start throwing
things at us.

22:34.387 --> 22:37.190
No, no. Bill wouldn't
do that, you know?

22:37.223 --> 22:38.324
He's our friend, right?

22:38.358 --> 22:39.593
That's true.

would know he was there.
Yeah.

22:50.336 --> 22:51.905
Oh, yeah, yeah,

22:51.938 --> 22:54.641
and people would catch us
talking to him,

22:54.675 --> 22:57.010

we were crazy.

But it wouldn't
be like that, would it?

23:16.029 --> 23:17.030
He'd just be...

he was faking, though.

about stuff like that.

to put you in the hospital.

you guys have ever
been nice to me.

28:11.525 --> 28:13.794
I remember, like,
in the fourth grade,

28:13.827 --> 28:16.597
I used to think you guys
were, like, really cool.

28:16.630 --> 28:20.266
And this one time,
you brought a model
of the Saturn 5

28:20.300 --> 28:21.568
in for show‐and‐tell,

28:21.602 --> 28:24.104
and I asked you guys
if I could shoot off
rockets with you,

28:24.137 --> 28:25.138
and you said no.

28:27.007 --> 28:30.977
So, what, I'm supposed
to be all nice to you guys
and stuff?

28:31.011 --> 28:33.213
I like comic books
and science fiction, too,

28:33.246 --> 28:35.348

ask me to hang out.

I promise, I'll never
be mean to you again,

28:48.629 --> 28:50.764
even if you do something
really stupid.

28:53.299 --> 28:54.300
Just don't die.

make sure he doesn't
put it in his mouth,

the kitchen tonight, ok?

29:06.446 --> 29:08.248
If he goes in there,
the first thing he's gonna do
is go after the knives.

29:08.281 --> 29:10.717
Um, he's already eaten,
so if he says he's hungry,

29:10.751 --> 29:12.018
that means he wants
junk food,

29:12.052 --> 29:13.954
and the junk food drawer
is in the kitchen.

29:13.987 --> 29:15.488

next to the sink.

29:15.522 --> 29:16.990

one thing.

but he can't.

Well, what's happening?

30:20.687 --> 30:22.222
He's in critical condition.

30:23.590 --> 30:24.591
Oh, my God.

30:25.526 --> 30:26.527
I hope he's ok.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.135
I feel so guilty.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.037
Why?

30:37.070 --> 30:38.605
If I would have taken
more care of myself

30:38.639 --> 30:39.873
when I was pregnant
with Bill,

30:41.174 --> 30:44.044
maybe he wouldn't even
get allergies like this.

30:44.077 --> 30:45.411
Don't blame yourself.

30:46.513 --> 30:48.248
We didn't know
back then.

30:51.552 --> 30:52.686
When I was pregnant
with Sam,

30:52.719 --> 30:55.556
I didn't think twice
about nutrition.

30:57.924 --> 31:01.261
I was drinking
a lot back then.

You're it! You're it!
You're it!

33:08.522 --> 33:10.190
I'm not it!
I'm not even playing.

33:10.223 --> 33:12.292
You're it!
You're it!
I found you!

33:12.325 --> 33:14.528
No, I wasn't even hiding.
Stop cheating.

33:14.561 --> 33:17.297
It's my turn
to hide now,
and you're cheating.

33:17.330 --> 33:19.332
No, no, no,
I'm not cheating.

33:19.365 --> 33:21.501
Just give me
some space, man, ok?

33:23.203 --> 33:25.238
Oh, my God, Lindsay.
What happened?

33:25.271 --> 33:27.007
Millie, the kid
is in there.

33:27.040 --> 33:28.474
He found me.

33:28.509 --> 33:30.076
So you're it.

33:30.110 --> 33:33.146
Well, I can't handle him
right now.

33:34.347 --> 33:36.382
What am I doing here, Millie?

33:37.483 --> 33:41.387
I don't like this place.
It's freaking me out.

33:42.956 --> 33:45.125
I don't like it.

33:45.158 --> 33:47.327
Maybe I'll go outside
and lay down for a while,

33:47.360 --> 33:49.930
and then I'll walk home
when I feel better, ok?

33:49.963 --> 33:51.497
No, Lindsay.

33:51.532 --> 33:52.666
Calm down.

33:53.433 --> 33:54.735
Just go
in the living room.

33:54.768 --> 33:55.902
I'll put Ronnie to bed,

33:55.936 --> 33:57.938
and then I'll come
take care of you.

33:57.971 --> 33:59.372
Thanks, Millie.

34:02.543 --> 34:03.710
Millie?

34:03.744 --> 34:04.745
Yeah?

34:05.846 --> 34:07.548
How long does this last?

34:13.219 --> 34:15.756
Nick is stoned
all the time.

34:17.958 --> 34:20.160
He deals
with his parents
when he's high.

34:20.193 --> 34:22.663
He goes to class
when he's high.

34:22.696 --> 34:23.830
Why would he do that?

34:24.698 --> 34:26.099
Because he's unhappy.

34:27.801 --> 34:28.802
That's right.

34:29.936 --> 34:31.137
That's right.

34:31.872 --> 34:33.339
He's unhappy.

34:34.274 --> 34:35.976
We're all unhappy.

34:36.009 --> 34:37.611
That's the thing
about life, Millie.

34:37.644 --> 34:40.681
That's the horrible
thing about life.

34:40.714 --> 34:42.048
I'm not unhappy.

34:42.082 --> 34:44.651
Yes, you are.
We all are.

34:44.685 --> 34:46.687
Well, not like you guys.

34:48.589 --> 34:49.523
Why not?

34:49.556 --> 34:52.492
Because I know
God's taking care of me.

34:56.229 --> 34:57.731
I don't believe in God.

34:58.131 --> 34:59.332
I know.

35:00.233 --> 35:02.168
That's why
you're unhappy.

35:02.202 --> 35:03.670
That's why
you're stoned.

35:05.271 --> 35:07.574
God doesn't make sense.

35:07.608 --> 35:09.209
It's not logical.

35:09.242 --> 35:11.311
Well, it may not
be logical,

35:11.878 --> 35:13.213
but I have faith.

35:14.314 --> 35:15.882
Faith based on what?

35:17.217 --> 35:18.819
What if this
is a dream?

35:20.987 --> 35:24.290
What if all of this
is a dream?

35:26.292 --> 35:29.362
What if all this
is a dream,

35:29.395 --> 35:31.331
and it's not even
our dream,

35:33.033 --> 35:35.569
it's that dog's dream.

35:35.602 --> 35:39.005
Maybe we're just
existing in his mind,

35:39.039 --> 35:42.576
and all of a sudden
he'll wake up to go
drink out of the toilet,

35:42.609 --> 35:44.778
and we'll be gone.

35:44.811 --> 35:47.714
What would happen to us
if that dog wakes up?

35:50.851 --> 35:52.452
It'll be over.

35:52.485 --> 35:54.888
Life is not
that dog's dream.

35:54.921 --> 35:56.557
We live in God's world.

36:02.796 --> 36:04.531
Millie, what
are you doing?

36:04.565 --> 36:05.999
I'm gonna
wake up this dog.

36:06.032 --> 36:07.534
Millie, no.
Don't, please.

36:07.568 --> 36:09.302
Lindsay, it'll be ok.
Don't worry.

36:09.335 --> 36:11.004
Don't wake up that dog,
Millie. Please.

36:11.037 --> 36:12.272
I don't want you to.

36:12.305 --> 36:13.774
Lindsay, it's ok.

36:13.807 --> 36:15.008
No, please.

36:15.041 --> 36:16.442
Just have faith,
Lindsay. Have faith.

36:16.476 --> 36:18.244
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

36:18.278 --> 36:20.313
Arise, doggy.
(YOWLS)

36:20.346 --> 36:24.084
Arise, doggy. Arise.

36:24.117 --> 36:25.351
You see?

36:30.824 --> 36:32.492
Believe, Lindsay.

36:34.728 --> 36:36.262
DOCTOR: All right,
just for a minute.

36:37.430 --> 36:39.332
Oh, Billy!
Mom!

36:42.202 --> 36:43.770
JEAN: Oh, my gosh.

36:43.804 --> 36:44.871
BILL: You're hurting me.

36:44.905 --> 36:47.007
Bill, you're alive!
I knew you'd make it.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.208
Did I almost die?

36:48.241 --> 36:50.210
Yes.
SAM: Yeah.

36:50.243 --> 36:51.344
That's cool.

36:51.377 --> 36:52.646
He's been
through a lot.

36:52.679 --> 36:54.247
His body has a lot
of recovering to do,

36:54.280 --> 36:56.016
so let's let him
get some rest.

36:56.049 --> 36:57.383
That's a good idea.

36:57.417 --> 36:59.953
I gotta call your dad.
He was worried sick.

36:59.986 --> 37:01.254
Really?

37:01.287 --> 37:03.323
Yeah, of course.
We all were.

37:04.124 --> 37:05.191
Come on, boys.

37:05.225 --> 37:06.627
Get some rest, ok?

37:06.660 --> 37:07.661
Ok.

37:11.231 --> 37:12.766
Bill, are you ok?

37:12.799 --> 37:13.667
Yeah.

37:13.700 --> 37:14.868
I got the smell of bacon
in my nose,

37:14.901 --> 37:16.970
but that always happens
after I pass out.

37:18.238 --> 37:19.439
Oh, guess what?

37:19.472 --> 37:21.775
Maureen and Vicki
showed up,

37:21.808 --> 37:23.476
and they
were crying.

37:23.510 --> 37:25.579
Really?
Because of me?

37:25.612 --> 37:27.614
Yeah. They were
really worried.

37:27.648 --> 37:29.516
Ever since they thought
you were dying,

37:29.550 --> 37:31.652
they've been hangin'
all over us.

37:32.452 --> 37:33.887
Wow.

37:33.920 --> 37:37.257
Well, if you want,
you can tell them
that I'm still dying.

37:37.290 --> 37:38.892
Really?

37:38.925 --> 37:41.494
Sure. I mean,
if it'll help
you guys get a date.

37:42.929 --> 37:44.565
You are the king.

37:44.598 --> 37:47.267
But you guys
have to come with me
to the sci‐fi convention.

37:47.300 --> 37:49.570
Are you kidding?
We were gonna
do that anyway.

37:49.603 --> 37:50.637
Really?

37:50.671 --> 37:51.672
Of course.

37:54.274 --> 37:57.077
Mmm.
This is so good.

37:57.110 --> 37:59.379
This is really
hittin' the spot.

37:59.412 --> 38:00.547
You know why
this is so good?

38:00.581 --> 38:02.448
Because it was made
by food scientists.

38:03.517 --> 38:05.519
I'm gonna go
put on some music.

38:07.621 --> 38:10.290
Maybe that'll help get
the monkey off your back.

38:10.323 --> 38:12.425
You're really
a good friend, Millie.

38:12.458 --> 38:13.994
You really saved me.

38:15.495 --> 38:18.899
(MAC DAVIS' DON'T GET
HOOKED ON ME PLAYS)

38:18.932 --> 38:21.501
I don't know what
I would have done
without you.

38:23.537 --> 38:27.373
Oh, this song is the best.

38:28.609 --> 38:29.743
God!

38:29.776 --> 38:33.013
We used to love
Mac Davis, remember?

38:33.046 --> 38:34.648
We used to watch
his show.

38:35.215 --> 38:36.617
Yeah.

38:36.650 --> 38:38.552
You used to wish
you had a pillow
stuffed with his hair.

38:40.386 --> 38:42.088
Because it was
so fluffy.

38:43.089 --> 38:46.560
God, I love
Mac Davis.

38:48.995 --> 38:50.363
You know who else
I love?

38:51.732 --> 38:52.733
You.

38:53.934 --> 38:56.002
I love you, Millie.

38:56.036 --> 38:57.638
Why aren't we
friends anymore?

38:59.072 --> 39:00.674
I thought
we were friends.

39:01.307 --> 39:03.376
We are, but just...

39:03.977 --> 39:05.078
you know.

39:05.946 --> 39:07.748
We're not, really.

39:07.781 --> 39:10.517
But we're still
the same people
we were when we were 5.

39:10.551 --> 39:11.985
It's just
different now.

39:13.587 --> 39:15.021
You're different now.

39:16.089 --> 39:17.357
You're right.

39:18.391 --> 39:20.861
But I'm not gonna be
different anymore.

39:20.894 --> 39:22.462
I'm gonna be the same...

39:22.495 --> 39:24.130
and we're gonna be
best friends.

39:25.666 --> 39:27.067
You know what, Lindsay?

39:28.201 --> 39:29.736
I feel sorry for you.

39:31.605 --> 39:32.773
Why?

39:32.806 --> 39:33.907
Because tomorrow‐‐

39:34.741 --> 39:36.743
when you're not
loaded anymore‐‐

39:38.311 --> 39:39.846
you're not gonna
believe in God,

39:41.381 --> 39:43.817
and you're not gonna want
to be my friend anymore.

39:45.051 --> 39:46.052
Millie...

39:47.120 --> 39:48.555
that's not true.

39:49.189 --> 39:50.390
I hope not.

39:52.826 --> 39:54.728
I can't tell you
how sorry I am about
this whole thing,

39:54.761 --> 39:57.130
and if there's
anything we can do
to make it better,

39:57.163 --> 39:58.799
you know,
just let me know.

39:58.832 --> 40:01.101
I think your son
could apologize to Bill now.

40:02.569 --> 40:03.804
Consider it done.

40:05.972 --> 40:07.440
What, are you
gonna yell at him
from out here?

40:07.473 --> 40:08.675
Come on,
come on, come on.

40:14.047 --> 40:15.048
Hey, Haverchuck.

40:17.483 --> 40:18.685
Hey, Alan.

40:20.353 --> 40:21.955
I knew you wouldn't die.

40:21.988 --> 40:24.958
I can't believe
you'd be such a wuss
to die from a peanut.

40:26.226 --> 40:27.994
Aren't you glad
I didn't die?

40:28.028 --> 40:29.530
Yeah, I'm glad for my sake.

40:29.563 --> 40:31.965
Think I want to end up
in juvie for killing you?

40:34.568 --> 40:36.202
What are you
looking at, dork?

40:37.237 --> 40:38.639
I heard you.

40:38.672 --> 40:40.641
You care about me.
I heard everything you said.

40:40.674 --> 40:42.275
I don't care about you.

40:42.308 --> 40:43.343
Yeah, you do.

40:43.376 --> 40:44.410
You think I'm cool.

40:44.444 --> 40:45.946
You want me to pound you?

40:47.180 --> 40:49.916
Do you want
to go with us to
the sci‐fi convention?

40:49.950 --> 40:51.417
It's this weekend.

40:51.451 --> 40:53.720
I don't want to hang out
with you losers.

40:53.754 --> 40:56.222
Why not?
'Cause you're losers.

40:56.256 --> 40:57.524
You know
you want to.

40:59.793 --> 41:00.827
No, I don't.

41:01.427 --> 41:02.796
Yeah, you do.

41:02.829 --> 41:05.031
Come on. It'll be
so much fun.

41:05.065 --> 41:07.233
George Takei
is gonna be there
and everything.

41:09.269 --> 41:10.604
George Takei?

41:11.404 --> 41:12.606
Yeah.

41:13.540 --> 41:14.608
I don't know.

41:14.641 --> 41:16.342
It'd be
kind of weird.

41:16.376 --> 41:19.746
Well, we're all gonna meet
at Sam's house at 10:00
on Saturday.

41:21.281 --> 41:22.683
If you want to go,
just show up.

41:30.423 --> 41:31.625
Haverchuck.

41:33.126 --> 41:34.127
Yeah?

41:38.331 --> 41:39.533
I'm sorry.

41:40.433 --> 41:41.768
Hey, it's ok.

41:43.537 --> 41:45.606
Just don't do it again,
'cause I could die.

41:46.907 --> 41:47.908
I know.

41:55.281 --> 41:56.683
Hey, Lindsay?

41:58.084 --> 41:59.285
Hey, how'd it go?

42:00.654 --> 42:04.290
I'm never babysitting
ever again.

42:05.792 --> 42:07.594
I know what you mean.

42:07.628 --> 42:08.829
Night, sweetie.

42:10.096 --> 42:11.097
Good night.

42:25.411 --> 42:26.613
Hi.

42:27.681 --> 42:29.215
I just came to visit.

42:30.717 --> 42:31.918
How are you doing?

42:32.719 --> 42:34.120
Are you feeling ok?

42:35.889 --> 42:36.890
I am now.

42:45.165 --> 42:47.433
Hey, where'd you get
the Dr. Who outfit?

42:47.467 --> 42:49.369
My mom gave it to me
for not dying.

42:49.402 --> 42:51.404
I really cleaned up
this time.

42:51.437 --> 42:55.075
Really?
Aw, man, I wish
I had allergies.

42:55.108 --> 42:57.343
I want
a C‐3PO mask.

42:58.244 --> 42:59.345
Hey, guys.

42:59.379 --> 43:01.181
Hi, Gordon.
Hey, Gordon.

43:01.214 --> 43:02.816
Where's your costume?

43:02.849 --> 43:04.985
I put everything on
in the parking lot.

43:05.018 --> 43:07.453
You know, that way
I don't look like
a loser all day.

43:07.487 --> 43:09.055
SAM: (LAUGHS)
Oh, yeah.

43:09.089 --> 43:11.191
