00:04.569 --> 00:04.787
.

00:04.830 --> 00:06.049
- Friends,

00:06.093 --> 00:08.051
let us raise a glass

00:08.095 --> 00:10.619
to dear Patrick Halstead.

00:10.662 --> 00:11.881
May you be in Heaven

00:11.924 --> 00:14.710
an hour before
the Devil knows you're dead.

00:14.753 --> 00:17.147
Sláinte!
all: Sláinte!

00:21.369 --> 00:23.240
- Let me get you another one.
- Yes, please.

00:23.284 --> 00:25.416
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

00:27.549 --> 00:29.855
- Will.

00:29.899 --> 00:31.379
- Tommy.
- Hey.

00:31.422 --> 00:33.511
Sorry about your dad.

00:33.555 --> 00:36.036
My old man couldn't be here.
He...

00:36.079 --> 00:37.211
he's not feeling so well.

00:37.254 --> 00:38.864
- Sorry to hear it.
- Yeah.

00:38.908 --> 00:41.737
You know, you could
do me a solid, though.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.478
Dad, he...

00:43.521 --> 00:45.088
he won't go to a hospital.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.872
Maybe you could come by
the house,

00:46.916 --> 00:48.222
give him a look

00:48.265 --> 00:50.180
- Sorry, Tommy, I'm an ED doc.

00:50.224 --> 00:52.226
Emergency medicine.

00:52.269 --> 00:54.315
- All right.
- I hope he feels better.

00:54.358 --> 00:56.621
- Thanks, Will.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.712
- Tommy.

01:00.756 --> 01:02.845
- Your father still running
the neighborhood?

01:02.888 --> 01:05.935
He'll never let that go.

01:06.762 --> 01:09.721
- All right, I'll drop by.
- Thanks a lot, Will.

01:09.765 --> 01:12.420
- You got it.

01:21.951 --> 01:24.780
You okay?
- Great, man.

01:26.869 --> 01:30.046
- ♪ Oh, father dear
I long to hear ♪

01:30.090 --> 01:33.223

It's only--what,
five days

02:02.209 --> 02:03.775
till your hybrid OR's up
and running?

02:03.819 --> 02:05.386
- Four, actually,
and I've still got

02:05.429 --> 02:08.215
personnel to train
and logistics to figure out.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.434
- You're nervous about this,
aren't you?

02:10.478 --> 02:13.089
I don't think
I've ever seen you nervous.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.656
It's refreshing.

02:14.699 --> 02:18.660
Not necessarily attractive,
but refreshing.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.188
- Help!
Help me!

02:25.232 --> 02:27.103
My son can't breathe.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.366
- Okay, come with me.

02:30.062 --> 02:32.195
- It's okay, buddy.

02:32.239 --> 02:33.849
- Dr. Choi.

02:33.892 --> 02:37.287
- Looks like the early stages
of respiratory failure.

02:37.331 --> 02:38.984
Lay him down here.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.552
- He was born with bad kidneys.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.119
They see him at the hospital
in Gary,

02:43.163 --> 02:44.642
but I don't think they know
what they're doing.

02:44.686 --> 02:46.775
- Daddy!
My tummy hurts.

02:46.818 --> 02:48.298
- When's the last time
he was dialyzed?

02:48.342 --> 02:50.605
- I don't know.
My--my ex deals with that.

02:50.648 --> 02:52.172
- Let's put him on oxygen,

02:52.215 --> 02:54.217
then let reno know
he needs dialysis.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.306
- It really hurts.
- I'm so sorry.

02:56.350 --> 02:58.047
- All right, Ben,
we're gonna give you something

02:58.090 --> 02:59.962
that'll make you feel better
in just a minute okay?

03:00.005 --> 03:01.311
- Here.

03:01.355 --> 03:02.921
- Okay.

03:02.965 --> 03:04.488
- He's got a lot of fluid
in his lungs.

03:04.532 --> 03:06.142
Hopefully, the dialysis will
bring it down.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.491
Then we can discuss
what to do next.

03:07.535 --> 03:08.971
- Yeah, of course, man,
whatever you say.

03:09.014 --> 03:10.842
- Dr. Choi.
- Hold on one second, Maggie.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.496
- I know this isn't easy,
but try to stay calm.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.194
We're gonna take good care
of your son.

03:14.237 --> 03:15.499
- Dr. Choi.

03:15.543 --> 03:18.285
Need to talk to you right now.
April.

03:23.377 --> 03:24.508
- That dad, Chris Davis,

03:24.552 --> 03:26.206
there's a BOLO out
for his arrest.

03:26.249 --> 03:28.512
"
- Yeah.

03:28.556 --> 03:30.210
He kidnapped his son.

03:33.256 --> 03:40.437
♪

03:44.572 --> 03:44.789
.

03:44.833 --> 03:47.879
- Apparently, he just got out
of Joliet on parole.

03:47.923 --> 03:50.099
Showed up at his ex-wife's,
grabs his son,

03:50.142 --> 03:51.753
and takes off.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.189
How's the boy?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.409
- End stage renal disease.
- Aw.

03:55.452 --> 03:57.280
The poor kid.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.413
I'll call PD.

03:59.456 --> 04:01.719
- Ms. Goodwin,
Ben's in bad enough shape

04:01.763 --> 04:03.373
without having him watch
his dad get arrested

04:03.417 --> 04:05.288
and taken away.
Could we just

04:05.332 --> 04:07.595
hold off until he's stabilized?
- April.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.597
- He risked his freedom
to bring Ben here.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.338
He's not gonna leave.

04:11.381 --> 04:13.905
- I'm not sure that's our call.

04:13.949 --> 04:16.430
Can you think
of any medical reason

04:16.473 --> 04:18.519
why we should hold off?

04:19.302 --> 04:20.608
- No.

04:20.651 --> 04:22.087
I'll keep an eye on Ben.

04:22.131 --> 04:24.960
Go ahead and make the call.
- Okay then.

04:27.136 --> 04:29.443
- Our first duty is
to protect our patient.

04:29.486 --> 04:31.140
By taking his dad away?

04:31.183 --> 04:33.664
- We have no idea what
this man is capable of.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.152
- Sharon.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.719
- Gwen.

04:45.372 --> 04:47.852
Dr. Lanik, new coat.

04:47.896 --> 04:49.985
- Since Dr. Stohl
is no longer here,

04:50.028 --> 04:54.337
Dr. Lanik will be
our interim chief of the ED.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.165
- Congratulations.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.863
- Thank you.
Excuse me.

05:00.778 --> 05:02.867
- You didn't consult me
on this.

05:02.911 --> 05:05.870
- Seems to be your mission
to fight me on everything.

05:05.914 --> 05:08.438
Until that changes,
I'm going to be making

05:08.482 --> 05:11.485
some decisions
unilaterally.

05:17.055 --> 05:20.407
- Mr. Nevins, I'm Dr. Rhodes.
Nice to meet you.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.974
- Call me Bill.
- All right, Bill it is.

05:23.018 --> 05:27.196
So I understand you've got
some new onset back pain, huh?

05:27.239 --> 05:28.676
- Yeah, but it's not too bad.

05:28.719 --> 05:30.982
It's nothing you need
to get making a fuss about.

05:31.026 --> 05:33.855
- Yeah, well, fuss is kind
of our thing here.

05:33.898 --> 05:37.641
Now it looks like your CT
shows an aortic dissection,

05:37.685 --> 05:39.034
which means you've got a tear

05:39.077 --> 05:40.949
on the inside
of your vessel wall.

05:40.992 --> 05:43.386
Do you have any tingling
in your arms?

05:43.430 --> 05:45.040
- Nope.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.520
- Any palpitations,

05:46.563 --> 05:48.696
funny feelings in your chest?

05:48.739 --> 05:51.873
- Nothing.
Seriously, I'm good to do.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.396
- Well, you might be right.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.876
It looks like the tear
is small,

05:54.919 --> 05:56.704
so if we can get
you stabilized,

05:56.747 --> 05:58.532
we should be able
to send you home

05:58.575 --> 05:59.794
to follow up with
the cardiologist.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.883
- That'd be great.
- All right.

06:01.926 --> 06:03.711
Start on him an Esmolol drip,

06:03.754 --> 06:05.539
and if his systolic
gets above 120,

06:05.582 --> 06:06.975
let me know.
- Yes, doctor.

06:07.018 --> 06:08.542
- I'll be back to check in
on you in a bit.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.413
- Thanks, doctor.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.548
- You ever taken a lead on
a case before?

06:14.591 --> 06:16.811
- Not yet.
- Well, today's your lucky day,

06:19.944 --> 06:23.295
- Mr. and Mrs. Harris,
I'm student doctor Curry

06:23.339 --> 06:24.645
and this is Doctor Manning.

06:24.688 --> 06:26.473
- I'm Lisa.
- Matt.

06:26.516 --> 06:29.432
- So you're 13 weeks pregnant

06:29.476 --> 06:31.478
with three days
of abdominal pain.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.480
Have you ever had pain
like this before?

06:33.523 --> 06:35.090
- No.

06:35.133 --> 06:39.268
- I'm going to examine you,
if that's all right.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.925
- Okay, have you had
any bleeding?

06:43.968 --> 06:45.056
- No.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.231
- Okay, any complications

06:46.275 --> 06:47.450
with your pregnancy?

06:47.494 --> 06:50.322
- No. I mean,
not with the pregnancy.

06:50.366 --> 06:53.543
- For years, doctors said Lisa
could never get pregnant.

06:53.587 --> 06:56.851
We tried and we prayed,
but nothing worked,

06:56.894 --> 06:59.680
until, one day,
it just happened.

07:00.985 --> 07:03.466
- Did they tell you why
you couldn't get pregnant?

07:03.510 --> 07:06.208
- Something about
the shape of my uterus.

07:06.251 --> 07:07.601
They did some tests,

07:07.644 --> 07:10.125
but whatever it is,
it doesn't matter

07:10.168 --> 07:12.823
'cause we finally have
our miracle baby.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.652
- So the thing
about human anatomy

07:15.696 --> 07:18.655
is that even when things
may seem like a miracle--

07:18.699 --> 07:20.135
- You know,
before we get much further,

07:20.178 --> 07:21.615
I think we should check
your blood

07:21.658 --> 07:23.443
and send you over
for a doppler,

07:23.486 --> 07:25.140
just to get some
more information.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.011
Is that okay?
- Yeah, that's okay.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.666
- Great.
We'll be back soon.

07:32.582 --> 07:33.975
- First trimester pain in
a woman

07:34.018 --> 07:35.759
with anatomic abnormalities

07:35.803 --> 07:37.805
means that this pregnancy
could be ectopic.

07:37.848 --> 07:39.502
- Yes, but that does not mean
that we need to give her

07:39.546 --> 07:41.156
a physiology lesson.

07:41.199 --> 07:43.506
- We do if we want her to be
informed about her condition.

07:43.550 --> 07:44.681
- She's entitled
to her beliefs.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.204
It is not our job
to challenge them.

07:46.248 --> 07:47.989
- It is when they're wrong.
- Ms. Curry,

07:48.032 --> 07:49.686
we don't know what we're
looking at yet,

07:49.730 --> 07:52.167
so just go order the tests.

07:55.953 --> 07:58.434
- Hey, Ben.
Feeling any better?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.871
- No.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.179
- He's in SVT.

08:04.222 --> 08:07.138
Give him 4 milligrams
of Diltiazem over 5 minutes.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.533
What's that?
- It's an arrhythmia.

08:11.882 --> 08:13.536
I thought the problem
was his kidneys.

08:13.580 --> 08:14.842
- It is,
but kidney failure can lead

08:14.885 --> 08:17.192
to dysfunction
in other systems.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.848
I mean, he's been doing that
and he's still getting worse.

08:20.891 --> 08:22.545
- We need to give it a chance
before I can assess

08:22.589 --> 08:24.242
what else he might need.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.683
- You didn't have to do this.

08:29.726 --> 08:32.729
- Sorry, legally I had to.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.735
- Hey, Benny.

08:38.779 --> 08:42.260
Benny, I got to go away
for a little while.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.567
But Dr. Choi

08:44.611 --> 08:46.221
is gonna take good care
of you, okay?

08:46.264 --> 08:49.354
So you listen to him
and do whatever he says,

08:49.398 --> 08:50.878
and I promise

08:50.921 --> 08:52.706
everything's gonna be okay.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.490
Okay?
- Okay.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.710
- Okay.

08:58.363 --> 09:02.106
I love you.
Okay.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.895
- Christopher Davis,
you're under arrest

09:07.938 --> 09:09.723
for aggravated kidnapping,
endangerment of a child,

09:09.766 --> 09:11.594
violation of an order
of protection,

09:11.638 --> 09:13.683
and violation of parole.

09:13.727 --> 09:16.251
- Do everything you can
for Ben.

09:16.294 --> 09:18.253
Please.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.429
- All right, let's go.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.213
- Burgess.

09:22.257 --> 09:25.260
- Hold up.
What's up?

09:26.130 --> 09:29.264
- His--his son's really sick.

09:29.307 --> 09:31.309
Could you keep him here
till we have a better idea

09:31.353 --> 09:33.268
of what's going?

09:33.311 --> 09:34.661
- That's not up to me.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.488
- I know.

09:36.532 --> 09:37.751
- If you want, I can--
I don't know--

09:37.794 --> 09:39.448
call the State's Attorney
and find out.

09:39.491 --> 09:40.797
- I'd appreciate it.

09:40.841 --> 09:43.365
He can wait in there.

09:43.408 --> 09:45.106
- Okay.

09:45.149 --> 09:46.586
Talbert.

09:46.629 --> 09:49.240
- Thanks.

09:52.461 --> 09:59.424
♪

10:00.512 --> 10:03.690
- Yes.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.870
- Your pregnancy is ectopic,

10:09.913 --> 10:11.872
which means that the fetus

10:11.915 --> 10:14.614
is implanted
outside of your uterus.

10:14.657 --> 10:17.007
- Okay, but you can put it back
where it belongs right?

10:17.051 --> 10:19.401
- Unfortunately, we can't.

10:19.444 --> 10:22.143
- And I'm afraid it's implanted
on your vena cava,

10:22.186 --> 10:25.799
the large vessel that carries
blood back to your heart.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.888
And from the free fluid

10:27.931 --> 10:30.020
I'm seeing in your abdomen

10:30.064 --> 10:33.284
tells me that, unfortunately,
the vessel is leaking.

10:35.243 --> 10:36.810
- I mean,
you need an operation.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.550
The surgeon will have
to remove the fetus

10:38.594 --> 10:39.813
and then repair the vessel.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.684
- Wait, you mean we...

10:41.728 --> 10:42.859
could lose the baby?

10:42.903 --> 10:45.166
- I'm sorry,
but you would in any case

10:45.209 --> 10:46.950
because of where
it's implanted.

10:46.994 --> 10:49.344
There's no possible way
that it'll survive

10:49.387 --> 10:50.650
long enough to be viable.

10:50.693 --> 10:51.999
- In surgery, we'll keep
your bleeding

10:52.042 --> 10:53.522
from getting out of control,

10:53.565 --> 10:56.786
so we need to get you up
to the OR as soon as possible.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.309
- No.

10:58.353 --> 11:01.095
- I am not having surgery.

11:01.138 --> 11:02.662
- I don't think you understand.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.968
If we don't operate,
you're going to die.

11:05.012 --> 11:06.796
- No, you don't understand.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.494
This baby is a miracle.

11:09.538 --> 11:11.540
And God will take care of it.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.375
- It's like it's tearing
a hole through my belly.

11:21.637 --> 11:22.856
- Maggie, we need to get
Mr. Nevins

11:22.899 --> 11:24.640
to interventional now.
- I'm on it.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.512
- Bill, I think the tear in
your aorta is getting larger,

11:27.556 --> 11:29.036
so we need to place a stent

11:29.079 --> 11:30.646
so it doesn't get
any worse okay?

11:30.690 --> 11:32.039
- Yes,

11:32.082 --> 11:33.867
if you say so.
- Okay.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.956
Maggie, get transport down.
We need to get him moving.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.305
- IR's full.
- It can't wait.

11:37.348 --> 11:38.480
Can they bump any cases?

11:38.523 --> 11:39.699
- No, and both CT O.R.s
are full too.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.048
There's nowhere to go.

11:41.091 --> 11:42.702
- If his aorta ruptures,
he's gonna bleed out.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.747
- Yeah.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.444
- I'm opening up
my hybrid O.R.

11:46.488 --> 11:47.968
- It's not ready yet,

11:48.011 --> 11:49.360
and it's not fully stocked.

11:49.404 --> 11:51.188
- Bill is too unstable.
I can't risk his aorta

11:51.232 --> 11:52.842
blowing while we wait
to get him upstairs.

11:52.886 --> 11:54.278
- That team is not trained yet

11:54.322 --> 11:56.759
and it--you haven't done
a single run-through.

11:56.803 --> 11:59.893
Dr. Rhodes!

12:03.287 --> 12:03.461
.

12:03.505 --> 12:06.247
- Will, when was the last time
you were here?

12:06.290 --> 12:08.684
- Man, I can't even remember.

12:10.033 --> 12:11.861
Hey, Tim.
- Will.

12:13.820 --> 12:14.951
- Just started.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.866
- All right.
- Dad.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.086
Hey, Dad.

12:19.129 --> 12:20.783
Will Halstead's here.

12:20.827 --> 12:23.003
- William.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.787
Still got the red hair.

12:24.831 --> 12:27.616
- Nice to see you, Mr. Burke.
- Please, Ray.

12:27.659 --> 12:30.575
- Dad, I'll be in the kitchen.
- Yeah.

12:30.619 --> 12:31.751
- See you, Will.

12:31.794 --> 12:35.102
- And, listen,
I'm sorry about your father.

12:35.145 --> 12:36.843
Good guy,

12:36.886 --> 12:38.453
but a terrible poker face.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.716
Always looked to the left
when he had a good hand.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.240
- And he loved those Friday
night games.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.287
So what seems
to be the problem?

12:46.330 --> 12:49.464
- It's nothing.
Tommy's a worrywart.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.814
I just been getting
these dizzy spells.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.642
Sometimes they'll lay me out
a couple hours.

12:53.685 --> 12:56.253
- Well, sit down.
Let's have a listen.

13:02.303 --> 13:05.175
- This is what's missing
from medicine these days,

13:05.219 --> 13:07.395
the face to face.

13:07.438 --> 13:10.833
I'll take a house call over
some giant hospital any day.

13:10.877 --> 13:13.836
- Can't say I blame you.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.666
Yeah, you do have a little
bit of a murmur.

13:17.709 --> 13:20.234
Probably worth keeping
an eye on.

13:20.277 --> 13:23.280
So what are you up
to these days?

13:23.324 --> 13:25.195
Still got that place down
on Union?

13:25.239 --> 13:26.849
Yeah.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.547
- Man,
must be a heck of a business.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.985
I tell you,
I'm getting married soon,

13:32.028 --> 13:33.421
and all the places out there

13:33.464 --> 13:36.076
are either booked up
or charging a fortune.

13:36.119 --> 13:38.861
- Oh.
- Yeah.

13:42.996 --> 13:45.172
Are you gonna ask me or what?

13:45.215 --> 13:46.347
- Ah, no, that's not why--

13:46.390 --> 13:48.262
- Come on, kid.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.699
You check in on me on
your day off,

13:50.742 --> 13:53.876
you need a hall.
I'm not an idiot.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.138
- I don't mean to--

13:55.182 --> 13:57.401
- I'm happy to do it.

13:59.403 --> 14:02.406
So just say yes.

14:04.974 --> 14:06.846
- You're too smart for me,
Mr. Burke.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.195
Ray.

14:08.238 --> 14:10.458
I really appreciate it.
- Nah.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.896
- I gotta draw some blood.
Run some tests.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.812
- My favorite part.

14:18.509 --> 14:20.685
- All right,
let's get this started.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.384
Where's Beth?
- Stuck in the O.R.

14:23.427 --> 14:26.430
This wasn't on the schedule.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.389
- Gene, what's happening
with the monitors?

14:28.432 --> 14:30.565
- It's a brand new system.
I'm still figuring it out.

14:30.608 --> 14:33.176
- Dr. Rhodes, patient's under.
I'm set.

14:34.525 --> 14:36.658
- I can't find the right-sized
guide wires.

14:36.701 --> 14:40.444
- All right, IV contrast,
injector tubing,

14:40.488 --> 14:42.490
and 20 and 60 CC syringes.

14:42.533 --> 14:43.752
I didn't know which ones
you wanted.

14:43.795 --> 14:45.493
- Thank you, Maggie.
- Welcome.

14:45.536 --> 14:48.409
- Dr. Rhodes, I still can't
find the correct guidewires.

14:48.452 --> 14:51.716
- Oh, that's the middle cabinet
top left corner.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.764
- Iris, call upstairs.
We're not gonna need Beth.

14:55.807 --> 14:58.027
- I can make the call.
- Nope. I need you to scrub in.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.073
I can't do that.

15:01.335 --> 15:02.466
- Yeah,
that's like forever ago.

15:02.510 --> 15:03.772
I don't even know
if I remember.

15:03.815 --> 15:06.340
- I need a pair of hands.
Go scrub in.

15:07.994 --> 15:11.432
- April, take over.
- Yeah. No problem.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.701
- Your patient, Mrs. Harris,
just passed

15:19.744 --> 15:21.311
the Brief Psychiatric
Rating Scale

15:21.355 --> 15:22.617
with flying colors.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.227
- You actually think
she's capable

15:24.271 --> 15:25.663
of making this decision?

15:25.707 --> 15:27.839
- She is holding on
to a very strong belief,

15:27.883 --> 15:30.625
but other than that she seems
entirely reasonable.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.322
She thinks God is going

15:32.366 --> 15:34.411
to save a fetus with
a 0% chance of survival.

15:34.455 --> 15:35.630
That's delusional.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.327
- Well, in my experience,

15:37.371 --> 15:38.850
it's not always so easy
to figure out

15:38.894 --> 15:42.245
where belief ends
and delusion begins.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.073
I mean,
faith in a supreme being

15:44.117 --> 15:46.946
is held by an overwhelming
majority of humans.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.992
- Okay, but if we don't do
something, she's going to die.

15:50.036 --> 15:51.994
- Can't force a procedure on
her that she doesn't want.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.778
- We're her doctors.

15:53.822 --> 15:56.042
Our job is to fix her,
not argue about theology.

15:56.085 --> 15:57.826
I'm sorry, but this is--
this is ridiculous.

15:57.869 --> 15:59.175
- Ms. Curry,

15:59.219 --> 16:01.308
I appreciate that this is
a complicated situation,

16:01.351 --> 16:04.267
but our job, in fact,
is to treat our patients

16:04.311 --> 16:06.661
to the best of our ability
while honoring

16:06.704 --> 16:10.317
their cultural, spiritual,
and religious beliefs.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.840
She's allowed
to make her own decisions

16:11.883 --> 16:15.800
whether we agree
with them or not.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.420
- What did the State's Attorney
say about that kid's dad?

16:26.463 --> 16:27.856
- Haven't heard back yet.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.510
- But does he have to wait in
my treatment room?

16:29.553 --> 16:30.859
- For now, yes, Ben needs
a kidney transplant.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.252
I want to see
if Chris is a match.

16:32.295 --> 16:33.427
- The man's going to jail.

16:33.470 --> 16:34.558
- And his son is dying.

16:34.602 --> 16:36.169
His boy needs a kidney.

16:36.212 --> 16:38.432
We don't have a choice.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.523
Almost done.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.351
- My ex is always telling
me how they're

16:44.394 --> 16:47.049
doing just fine without me.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.182
Then I saw him lying there,

16:49.225 --> 16:51.184
looking so sick.

16:51.227 --> 16:52.881
Yeah...

16:52.924 --> 16:55.014
- For whatever it's worth,
Ben may very well have died

16:55.057 --> 16:56.972
if you hadn't brought
him here today.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.452
- Anyway,

16:58.495 --> 17:00.236
it's not like
he's gonna miss me.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.543
Never really been there
for him in the first place.

17:02.586 --> 17:05.067
- I'll have the results soon.

17:08.114 --> 17:15.121
♪

17:20.909 --> 17:24.173
- The Journal of "Computer
Methods and Biomedicine."

17:25.609 --> 17:28.047
- Yep.

17:28.090 --> 17:30.092
- Looks very technical.
- It is.

17:30.136 --> 17:32.094
But so is creating
a biomolecular scaffolding

17:32.138 --> 17:34.357
to replicate human organs
in vitro.

17:35.445 --> 17:38.492
That's what I'm going to do
as soon as I finish med school.

17:38.535 --> 17:41.234
- Sounds rewarding.

17:41.277 --> 17:42.670
You know,
in terms of Mrs. Harris,

17:42.713 --> 17:45.238
I just want to clarify that...

17:45.281 --> 17:46.630
the challenge when
you're trying

17:46.674 --> 17:48.110
to evaluate a patient's ability
to act

17:48.154 --> 17:49.590
in their own interests...

17:49.633 --> 17:51.200
- Oh, actually...

17:51.244 --> 17:54.116
her labs are ready.
I-I should go check on them.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.823
- Femoral sheath is in.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.435
Gene, get in closer.

18:08.478 --> 18:10.785
- Zooming in.

18:16.356 --> 18:17.748
- That bulge there,

18:17.792 --> 18:19.446
that's where his aortic wall
is the weakest.

18:19.489 --> 18:20.882
- That wasn't there before.

18:20.925 --> 18:23.319
- That's because
his aneurysm's enlarging.

18:23.363 --> 18:25.539
We need to open him up.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.846
- His aorta is being
squeezed closed.

18:28.890 --> 18:30.979
I'm gonna try going in
from the top.

18:31.022 --> 18:33.155
- Dr. Rhodes,
the team's not ready.

18:33.199 --> 18:34.461
Let me just call upstairs--

18:34.504 --> 18:36.027
- We don't have time to go
upstairs.

18:36.071 --> 18:37.942
- Dr. Rhodes, we don't even
have profusion down here.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.467
- So we'll do it without.
Set up for a thoracotomy.

18:40.510 --> 18:42.773
- Dr. Rhodes--
- Maggie!

18:42.817 --> 18:45.036
We are opening him up.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.474
- All right, you heard the man.

18:47.517 --> 18:49.084
Let's get set up
for a thoracotomy.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.825
Let's go!

18:54.176 --> 18:54.350
.

18:54.394 --> 18:57.266
- I can't get a good angle
on the aorta.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.531
- You opened his chest.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.098
- We didn't have a choice.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.796
- You told me yourself
this room wasn't ready.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.190
What if this patient
doesn't survive?

19:09.452 --> 19:11.802
Connor, I advocated
for this program.

19:11.846 --> 19:13.413
For you.

19:13.456 --> 19:16.155
And now you're gonna blow it up
before it even starts?

19:16.198 --> 19:17.895
- Damn it.
This isn't working.

19:17.939 --> 19:20.115
- Great.
How do you propose we get him

19:20.159 --> 19:21.682
upstairs with his chest open?

19:21.725 --> 19:23.379
- I'm not going to.

19:23.423 --> 19:26.817
Get me a five-inch
30 millimeter Dacron graft.

19:26.861 --> 19:29.994
We're gonna cut out the damaged
aorta and sew in a graft.

19:30.038 --> 19:32.171
Prepare for cross clamp.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.999
- Cross clamp.
That only gives you 30 minutes

19:35.043 --> 19:36.305
even under the best
of circumstances.

19:36.349 --> 19:37.785
This is a terrible long shot.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.656
- Yeah, I understand the risk.

19:39.700 --> 19:40.962
- Fine, I'll scrub in.

19:41.005 --> 19:42.093
Six and a half gloves.

19:42.137 --> 19:45.184
- No, I have everyone I need.

19:47.925 --> 19:51.102
- You wanna kill this man,
fine.

19:52.103 --> 19:54.410
- Cross clamps times two.

19:54.454 --> 19:57.065
- Thank you.

19:57.935 --> 19:59.502
- Right away.

19:59.546 --> 20:01.330
- Natalie.

20:01.374 --> 20:02.940
Hey, so you know
how it's been impossible

20:02.984 --> 20:04.290
to find a venue
for the wedding?

20:04.333 --> 20:06.205
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I found one.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.032
- And not just found it.

20:08.076 --> 20:10.470
Killed it.
Seats 200,

20:10.513 --> 20:13.037
separate room for cocktails,
and I got the place at cost.

20:14.343 --> 20:16.345
- The owner's a guy
who knew my dad.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.086
He wasn't feeling well,
so I made a house call.

20:18.129 --> 20:20.349
I looked him over
and he insisted we take it.

20:20.393 --> 20:22.525
Will, that's fantastic.

20:22.569 --> 20:24.527
- That's how Canaryville works:
you scratch my back,

20:24.571 --> 20:26.268
I scratch yours.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.530
- Dr. Manning.

20:27.574 --> 20:28.792
- The ICU just called.

20:28.836 --> 20:30.272
Mrs. Harris's
pressure's dropping.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.100
- On my way.

20:32.143 --> 20:34.363
This is great.
- Yeah.

20:34.407 --> 20:37.018
- Let's go.

20:38.759 --> 20:40.543
- She's 90/60.

20:42.328 --> 20:43.459
- Let's see.

20:45.679 --> 20:46.897
- You're losing too much blood.

20:46.941 --> 20:48.247
We need to get you
to surgery now.

20:48.290 --> 20:49.596
- I already told you no.

20:49.639 --> 20:51.162
- Honey, maybe we should listen
to the doctors.

20:51.206 --> 20:54.078
- Not you too, Matt.
I am not having surgery.

20:54.122 --> 20:56.298
- Lisa--
- Please stop.

20:58.822 --> 21:02.043
For 12 years all I wanted

21:02.086 --> 21:04.088
was to bring a new life
into this world,

21:04.132 --> 21:06.265
and finally...

21:06.308 --> 21:08.267
God has rewarded my patience.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.094
And I don't believe
that He would turn around

21:10.138 --> 21:12.662
and take it all away.

21:17.754 --> 21:20.801
- If the fetus were to...

21:20.844 --> 21:24.326
stop living
because of the blood loss,

21:24.370 --> 21:26.763
would you give us permission
to do the surgery then,

21:26.807 --> 21:28.722
to let us save your life?

21:28.765 --> 21:30.201
- What are you--

21:30.245 --> 21:31.942
why is she even talking
about this?

21:31.986 --> 21:33.074
That's not gonna happen.

21:33.117 --> 21:34.467
- She's just asking.

21:34.510 --> 21:37.121
- So will you at least
agree to that?

21:37.165 --> 21:39.515
If the fetus dies.

21:42.475 --> 21:46.087
- Fine, if that happened,
which it won't,

21:46.130 --> 21:47.784
then...

21:47.828 --> 21:50.744
yes, I would have a surgery.
Can we stop talking about this?

21:50.787 --> 21:51.962
- Of course.

21:52.006 --> 21:53.137
- Bolus a liter of saline,

21:53.181 --> 21:54.748
and type and cross
for six and six,

21:54.791 --> 21:56.663
and give her two units
of uncrossmatched blood now.

21:56.706 --> 21:58.186
- Yeah.

21:58.229 --> 22:00.275
- We'll be back to check on
your shortly okay?

22:00.319 --> 22:02.321
- Okay.
- Thank you.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.324
- Ms. Curry,

22:05.367 --> 22:08.631
that was a disturbing,
tactless question.

22:08.675 --> 22:10.416
Why did you ask that?

22:10.459 --> 22:13.506
- Because we--
we should know, right?

22:13.549 --> 22:14.855
To be prepared.

22:14.898 --> 22:17.074
- No, there is a difference
between being prepared

22:17.118 --> 22:19.642
and terrifying a sick woman.

22:22.602 --> 22:25.474
- I'm at work.

22:25.518 --> 22:27.128
What?

22:27.171 --> 22:29.173

22:29.217 --> 22:30.218
Emily, don't you know
you can't put

22:30.261 --> 22:31.480

22:31.524 --> 22:33.569

microwave

22:33.613 --> 22:35.179
No, don't touch anything, okay?
I'll take care

22:37.399 --> 22:39.445

22:40.184 --> 22:42.578
- She's your sister.
Talk to her however you want.

22:42.622 --> 22:45.842
- Nothing.

22:45.886 --> 22:47.061
It's just unfortunate

22:47.104 --> 22:48.454
that you can't give
anyone a break.

22:50.151 --> 22:52.066
You know, I can't win with you.

22:52.109 --> 22:53.720
You disapproved when
I was tough on Emily,

22:53.763 --> 22:55.722
then you walked out
when I took her in,

22:55.765 --> 22:57.245

at me for telling her

23:20.224 --> 23:22.096

23:22.966 --> 23:24.881
It's for a friend.

23:24.925 --> 23:26.405
- I can't run blood work

23:26.448 --> 23:29.233
for anyone who's not
a patient in the hospital.

23:29.277 --> 23:31.410
- Come on, Joey.
What's the big deal?

23:31.453 --> 23:34.238
- Processing bodily fluids
is highly regulated

23:34.282 --> 23:35.457
and if my numbers
don't match up,

23:35.501 --> 23:37.241
