{\an5}-Out of her vagina?

-Are you [bleep] crazy?

00:24.023 --> 00:25.942
You're going down.
I'm winning this.

00:26.025 --> 00:27.736
You better be able
to back that [bleep] up.

00:27.819 --> 00:28.778
You're going down!

00:28.862 --> 00:31.489
I was having [bleep] fun!

00:31.573 --> 00:33.408
You didn't have fun

Ow!

<i>The artists faced</i>
<i>their most challenging</i>

00:38.872 --> 00:41.082
<i>human canvases yet.</i>

00:41.166 --> 00:43.460
You added that [bleep]
without telling me.

00:43.543 --> 00:44.794
My canvas is just [bleep] crazy.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.213
Do the yellow. It's on my back.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.006
I can't even [bleep] see it.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.632

00:49.716 --> 00:52.177

<i>Lalo and Nick</i>

00:53.970 --> 00:56.431
{\an5}-Nick.

00:53.970 --> 00:56.431
-Goddamn, this is ugly.

00:56.514 --> 00:58.057
It bothers the [bleep]
out of me.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.267
I wish you could understand.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.102
She was an impossible client.

01:01.186 --> 01:01.770
{\an5}-Lalo.

01:01.186 --> 01:01.770
-Very well drawn,

01:01.853 --> 01:03.021
but very poorly executed.

01:03.104 --> 01:04.813
The outline is weak
and the color's not bright.

01:04.897 --> 01:08.443
You're [bleep] your tattoo up.

01:08.526 --> 01:10.278
Nick, you do not have
what it takes to be <i> Ink Master</i> .

[upbeat music]

02:21.057 --> 02:22.016
Good morning, guys.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.561
Look at her.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.813
She cannot take that smile from
ear to ear off this morning.

02:26.896 --> 02:29.649
And who has won a challenge?

02:29.732 --> 02:32.068
Best tattoo of the day
goes to Sarah.

02:32.151 --> 02:33.069
You did a great job.

02:33.152 --> 02:35.238
I feel very satisfied,
I have to say.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.239
Very satisfied.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.282
Doesn't mean there's not
room for improvement

02:37.365 --> 02:39.075
in areas of weakness.

02:39.158 --> 02:40.785
I don't need to prove
anything right now.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.537
Okay, that's cool.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.163
{\an8}<i>Sarah has no poker face.</i>

02:44.247 --> 02:45.081
{\an8}<i>If you don't have</i> <i>a poker face,</i>

02:45.164 --> 02:47.417
{\an8}people are going to know
how easy it is

02:47.500 --> 02:48.418
{\an8}to push your buttons.

02:48.501 --> 02:49.711
Sarah, you're
a great tattoo artist,

02:49.794 --> 02:51.462
but you have mental weaknesses.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.755
No, I don't.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.340
{\an8}My ultimate strategy
to win this competition

02:54.424 --> 02:58.469
{\an8}is to make great artists
not perform on their level.

02:58.553 --> 02:59.095
<i>I love my puppets.</i>

02:59.178 --> 03:00.930
I got Sarah over here.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.432
When I get bored, I just--

03:02.515 --> 03:04.100
I just play with them.

03:04.183 --> 03:06.769
She is the, like,
female version of Clint.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.938
It's either,
"Things are really great,"

03:09.022 --> 03:10.023
or, "Oh, my God!"

03:10.106 --> 03:12.358
Just because
I take things seriously

03:12.442 --> 03:13.818
doesn't mean you can
make fun of me.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.987
It's so easy
to press your buttons, Sarah.

03:16.654 --> 03:18.031
{\an8}Boop.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.074
{\an8}Boop.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.117
No reason to be defensive.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.410
Whatever.

03:22.493 --> 03:23.411
Look at that face.

03:23.494 --> 03:25.997
It's starting--
"Screw-face Sarah."

03:26.080 --> 03:28.333
That's the nickname, y'all.
"Sarah the screw-face."

03:28.416 --> 03:29.626
{\an8}If the world [bleep] on you

03:29.709 --> 03:31.461
{\an8}and you still
keep getting back up,

03:31.544 --> 03:33.630
<i>and if you can do that</i>
<i>and still be creative,</i>

03:33.713 --> 03:35.506
that'll make you a winner.

[rock music]

03:43.056 --> 03:45.850
[rock music]

03:51.814 --> 03:53.566
{\an8}It is great to get the
hell out of the tattoo shop

03:53.650 --> 03:54.984
<i>and go to Coney Island.</i>

03:57.070 --> 03:58.404
{\an8}I'm not riding no
[bleep] roller coasters

03:58.488 --> 04:00.323
<i>and I'm not eating</i>
<i>no weird [bleep],</i>

04:00.406 --> 04:02.825
<i>so, if that's the case,</i>
<i>then I'm already [bleep].</i>

04:02.909 --> 04:04.285
Freak show, baby.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.046
Welcome to Coney Island.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.298
Yes, sir.

04:17.382 --> 04:20.551
Coney Island's first freak show
opened in 1880,

04:20.635 --> 04:22.387
and tattoos were a staple.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.556
This week, we are
testing you on texture.

04:26.265 --> 04:27.100
For today's Flash Challenge,

04:27.183 --> 04:30.311
you must tattoo
an area of the body

04:30.395 --> 04:32.647
known for its difficult texture.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.440
The inside of the mouth.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.819
Whoo!

04:37.902 --> 04:39.195
[bleep].

04:39.278 --> 04:40.488
<i>The tricky part about</i>
<i>this challenge is</i>

04:40.571 --> 04:41.197
{\an8}we're going to make
the artist tattoo

04:41.281 --> 04:43.908
{\an8}on a difficult area of the skin,

04:43.992 --> 04:46.703
<i>something that has a very</i>
<i>hard texture to work with.</i>

04:46.786 --> 04:48.454
I hope nobody's breath stinks.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.373
<i>The texture on the</i>
<i>inside of a lip is difficult.</i>

04:50.456 --> 04:51.582
{\an8}If you don't go deep enough,

04:51.666 --> 04:52.333
<i>the line will barely come out,</i>

04:52.417 --> 04:54.043
and if you go a hair too deep,

04:54.127 --> 04:54.627
the skin, it almost
pops a little bit,

04:54.711 --> 04:56.713
like a grape.

04:56.796 --> 04:57.880
In the 19th century,

04:57.964 --> 05:00.675
having your tongue tattooed
was considered so painful

05:00.758 --> 05:02.051
that Hawaiian women would do it

05:02.135 --> 05:04.595
to mourn the death
of their husbands.

05:04.679 --> 05:05.763
{\an8}I'm not tattooing on a tongue.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.057
<i>It's like tattooing</i>
<i>a wet sponge.</i>

05:08.141 --> 05:09.851
Your clients have been
randomly assigned,

05:09.934 --> 05:11.102
and you'll have
30 minutes to tattoo

05:11.185 --> 05:14.022
the inside of
your client's mouth.

05:14.105 --> 05:15.815
The winner of the
Flash Challenge will have power

05:15.898 --> 05:18.234
to assign all human canvases
in the elimination tattoo.

05:18.317 --> 05:23.865
Grab your machines.
Your time begins...Now.

05:23.948 --> 05:27.660
[rock music]

05:27.744 --> 05:28.995
<i>The texture of</i>
<i>the inside of the lip</i>

05:29.078 --> 05:30.455
<i>and the texture of the tongue</i>

05:30.538 --> 05:32.290
{\an8}is very different from
the texture of your skin.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.334
<i>Your ink, as you're tattooing,</i>
<i>fills up those textures</i>

05:34.417 --> 05:37.795
<i>and it's hard to see</i>
<i>what you're doing.</i>

05:37.879 --> 05:38.713
<i>Whether it's a word</i> <i>or an</i>
<i>image,</i>

05:38.796 --> 05:40.715
<i>we just want to see</i> <i>who can do</i>

05:40.798 --> 05:43.718
a decent, clean,
readable tattoo.

05:43.801 --> 05:45.011
I'm Tray. What's your name?

05:45.094 --> 05:46.179
{\an5}-Tray? I'm Ester.

05:45.094 --> 05:46.179
-Nice to meet you.

05:46.262 --> 05:47.430
{\an8}It's more of a novelty tattoo.

05:47.513 --> 05:50.683
<i>You don't expect it</i>
<i>to turn out super-great</i>

05:50.767 --> 05:52.101
because of the texture
of the skin.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.603
<i>As long as you can get</i>
<i>something in there to stay,</i>

05:53.686 --> 05:55.605
<i>the client's usually happy.</i>

05:55.688 --> 05:57.774
I really want to
stay away from words.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.025
Okay.

05:59.108 --> 05:59.776
{\an8}I want to do something different

05:59.859 --> 06:00.735
{\an8}that nobody else is gonna do.

06:00.818 --> 06:03.279
I got something creative.
You want to see?

06:03.362 --> 06:04.238
A plug on the tongue,

06:04.322 --> 06:05.782
and a socket on
the side of your lip.

06:05.865 --> 06:08.326
[laughs] I'm down.

06:08.409 --> 06:09.577
Let's do it.

06:09.660 --> 06:10.745
<i>I think people see me as</i>
<i>a threat in their own way.</i>

06:10.828 --> 06:13.623
Style is something that
you can't be trained to have,

06:13.706 --> 06:16.626
and I clearly got more style
than anybody in the competition.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.796
{\an8}Kay Kutta is not a threat
to my tattooing ability at all.

06:19.879 --> 06:20.797
<i>I don't care what Kay's doing.</i>

06:20.880 --> 06:22.757
My tattoos are good,
I don't give a [bleep]

06:22.840 --> 06:23.716
what anybody else is doing.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.885
Stick figure
blowing his head off.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.970
Maybe some brains,
or some, I don't know,

06:28.054 --> 06:29.055
some dot splatter.

06:29.138 --> 06:30.223
<i>My strategy with this tattoo</i>

06:30.306 --> 06:32.475
{\an8}is to get in, get out,
and not deal with his breath.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.520
This tattoo is going
to taste like [bleep].

06:38.731 --> 06:39.690
Let's do this.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.154
[tattoo needle buzzing]

06:45.238 --> 06:48.574

06:48.658 --> 06:48.991
How we doing? Alright?

06:49.075 --> 06:50.618
[loud groan]

06:52.912 --> 06:54.914
<i>My canvas says</i>

06:54.997 --> 06:56.249
{\an8}"Either the lip or the tongue."

06:56.332 --> 06:59.085
<i>What I'm gonna do is</i>
<i>an eyeball on his tongue</i>

06:59.168 --> 07:01.045
so it looks like
he ate his eyeball.

07:03.172 --> 07:06.175
<i>I'm just going to try to do</i>
<i>a photo-realistic eyeball.</i>

07:06.259 --> 07:07.552
<i>I'm not tattooing a tongue.</i>

07:07.635 --> 07:10.471
{\an8}Sebastian was stupid enough
to try it in this competition.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.640
[tattoo needle buzzing]

07:18.563 --> 07:20.022
<i>Every single challenge,</i>
<i>I'm trying to do my best.</i>

07:20.106 --> 07:22.316
{\an8}I don't want to go home.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.861
<i>I'm trying to win and I'm trying</i>
<i>to make it till the end.</i>

07:24.944 --> 07:25.653
Alright, guys, ten minutes left.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.326
{\an8}Luckily for your boy Clint here,

07:32.410 --> 07:33.619
{\an8}I've done this [bleep] before.

07:33.703 --> 07:34.203
How many would
you think you've done?

07:34.287 --> 07:36.539
More than 10? 20, 30?

07:36.622 --> 07:38.374
{\an5}- At least, 100. Yeah.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.374
- 100?

07:38.457 --> 07:41.127
By doing it with script,
it shows that I can work

07:41.210 --> 07:44.213
really well in a tight area
with this kind of texture.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.507
I've been in
plenty of people's mouths.

07:46.591 --> 07:47.967
Thank you for having
such great-smelling breath.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.719
[giggling]

07:50.511 --> 07:53.264
[whimpering]

07:54.640 --> 07:57.059
{\an8}I know that color
typically doesn't last too long

07:57.143 --> 07:58.060
{\an8}on the inside of lips,

07:58.144 --> 07:59.896
<i>but I'm adding color</i>
<i>to her tattoo</i>

07:59.979 --> 08:01.981
<i>because I think it will</i>
<i>make it look better.</i>

08:02.064 --> 08:03.524
Five minutes remaining.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.612
<i>A lot of people are doing these</i>

08:07.695 --> 08:08.571
{\an8}crazy designs on the lip.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.907
<i>Now I'm worried</i>
<i>that maybe I went</i>

08:10.990 --> 08:12.533
<i>too much of the easy route.</i>

08:12.617 --> 08:13.576
Ten seconds.

08:13.659 --> 08:17.747
Nine, eight, seven, six,

08:17.830 --> 08:21.709
five, four, three, two,

one.

08:23.544 --> 08:23.920
[spits]

08:24.003 --> 08:25.755
No more ink.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.135
{\an8}I know I have the best
lip tattoo here.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.722
I got in that mouth,
and I [bleep] rocked it.

08:38.433 --> 08:39.727
Lalo.

08:39.809 --> 08:41.770
This is the first time
I've seen people

08:41.854 --> 08:43.773
actually do color in the mouth.

08:43.856 --> 08:44.524
Pretty crazy.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.276
{\an8}Color inside the lip
is a pretty big no-no.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.446
<i>It's the first thing that goes.</i>

08:50.529 --> 08:50.780
Jamie.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.865
Oh.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.284
When I saw it halfway through,
it looked like a mess,

08:55.368 --> 08:56.160
but you took your time
to clean it up.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.370
That's creepy.

08:58.496 --> 08:59.622
Tatu Baby.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.249
That's the kind of lip tattoo
I'm used to seeing.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.084
{\an5}-Yeah, I mean...

09:01.332 --> 09:03.084
-Lettering.

09:03.167 --> 09:05.962
Very solid, very dark.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.797
It's hard to keep
those lines parallel

09:07.880 --> 09:09.548
in that crazy texture
in the lip.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.968
{\an8}I'm like, "Yes!"
They seem to like it.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.427
Next up, Mark.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.013
I'm having a hard time
seeing what that is.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.390
I think the word is clear,

09:17.473 --> 09:20.142
but the stick figure
is not legible.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.062
Sebastian.

09:23.896 --> 09:24.730
I gave him a third eye.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.066
Most of the tongue tattoos
I've seen

09:27.149 --> 09:28.234
have dissipated pretty quickly.

09:28.317 --> 09:29.485
I have never tattooed a tongue.

09:29.568 --> 09:31.404
I was like, "You know what,
like, let's see."

09:31.487 --> 09:32.613
And I would say that
the white ink is

09:32.697 --> 09:35.950
probably going to
not stay very long.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.285
I wouldn't have made
that choice.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.080
Jesse.

09:41.163 --> 09:42.957
For the texture of the lip
and everything else,

09:43.040 --> 09:44.292
I mean, Jesse, you were
pretty spot-on in there.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.501
That was a tight outline.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.753
You got a lip sleeve, fully.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.632
Next up is Sarah.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.051
It's probably one of the more
difficult surfaces to work on.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.052
It's tough to run
a clean line in there.

09:55.136 --> 09:58.014
We've seen a lot of
janky inner lip tattoos.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.433
I think the simplistic design
is the way to go.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.476
Clint.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.896
Great script, super tight,
clean,

10:05.980 --> 10:06.605
goes with the rest of them.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.232
That looks pretty in there.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.525
Just experience with it.

10:09.608 --> 10:10.860
Proportion. It looks right.

10:11.736 --> 10:12.987
I've done this 1,000 times,

10:13.070 --> 10:14.530
{\an8}I can't help it
if everybody else

10:14.613 --> 10:15.781
{\an8}just doesn't know what
the [bleep] they're doing.

10:16.449 --> 10:16.866
Thanks, guys.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.659
Steve.

10:19.910 --> 10:20.995
I want to stay simple,

10:21.078 --> 10:23.456
that way she could wear it
for as long as she can.

10:23.539 --> 10:24.540
Some of the lines are in there

10:24.623 --> 10:26.042
a little better than the others.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.376
I'll have to see how it heals.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.086
Tray.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.297
It's pretty deep in there.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.132
So it's very difficult to read.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.884
I think it's really
tight and clean,

10:34.967 --> 10:37.511
one of the best techniques,
the way you got it in there bold

10:37.595 --> 10:38.846
and it looks like
it's going to stay.

10:39.263 --> 10:41.807
Kay Kutta.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.810
You're the only guy who
tattooed the tongue and the lip.

10:44.894 --> 10:45.686
I figured that.

10:46.812 --> 10:47.772
That's crazy.

10:47.855 --> 10:49.940
{\an8}Kay Kutta doesn't have
enough skill level yet.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.359
{\an8}He's trying to be clever,
instead of being

10:51.442 --> 10:51.776
{\an8}a good tattoo artist.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.739
Alright, guys.
This was a weird one.

10:56.822 --> 10:57.990
Insides of the mouths.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.825
Let's start off with Jesse,
who did colors, blending.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.702
Honestly, I believe
it was just a little too much.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.413
I think the white outline's
hiding the fact

11:04.497 --> 11:05.748
that the other outline's
not that clean.

11:05.831 --> 11:09.001
I'm assuming that Clint
would be in the top here.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.628
That fancy a script
is really hard.

11:10.711 --> 11:13.464
He technically knew
what he was doing

11:13.547 --> 11:15.800
and he was able to lay out
his guidelines

11:15.883 --> 11:17.426
and then go back in
and really hammer it.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.471
For being simple and bold,
I got to say Tatu Baby.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.932
She did a straight-up,
textbook lip tattoo.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.267
She just pulled it down,
did clean lettering,

11:25.351 --> 11:26.227
and got out of there.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.436
Who really let us down?

11:27.520 --> 11:30.439
Mark, with the little stick
figure blowing his head off.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.690
Way too much detail,
too close together.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.652
{\an5}-Kay Kutta.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.652
-It was a funny concept.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.112
I don't know
how often I'd want to

11:36.195 --> 11:39.073
see that concept put to use.
It was pretty ugly.

11:39.156 --> 11:40.866
Alright, so I think
we got a decision here.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.159
For me, it's a no-brainer.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.828
{\an5}-Knock this one out.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.828
-Yes, sir.

11:43.911 --> 11:46.288
In this Flash Challenge,
we were testing your ability

11:46.372 --> 11:49.375
to tattoo a surface
with a difficult texture.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.128
The judges have decided,

11:52.211 --> 11:54.296
and the winner of
this Flash Challenge...

11:57.174 --> 11:58.217
...is Clint.

11:58.300 --> 12:01.887
[applause]

12:01.971 --> 12:03.556
{\an8}It's about [bleep]
time that I won.

12:03.639 --> 12:06.308
<i>I needed this.</i> <i>I needed to win.</i>

12:06.392 --> 12:08.727
Just a big "[bleep] you"
to everybody.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.187
Congratulations, man.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.313
You know have
the power to assign

12:11.397 --> 12:14.859
all the human canvases
in the elimination tattoo.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.652
{\an8}Clint needed to win
a Flash Challenge, man.

12:16.735 --> 12:19.155
<i>Now we don't have to</i>
<i>watch him mope around</i>

12:19.238 --> 12:20.573
and kick rocks and cry.

12:20.656 --> 12:21.824
So head on back to the shop

12:21.907 --> 12:23.451
and get ready to meet
your canvases

12:23.534 --> 12:25.411
for the next elimination tattoo.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.373
{\an8}I do have a plan.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.041
{\an8}This is chess, not checkers.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.209
[laughs]

12:32.293 --> 12:34.336
I'm screwed.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.380
Time is slipping off my hands.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.882
I'm freaking out.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.639
Man, I don't know
if I'm really falling

12:45.723 --> 12:47.516
for Clint's "I don't have
a strategy" claim.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.476
No, definitely not.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.019
All I know is when
you get a chance to play

12:50.102 --> 12:50.895
and you don't play right,
you're shooting yourself

12:50.978 --> 12:52.771
in the foot.
Nah, [bleep] The foot.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.190
You're shooting yourself
in the head.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.108
I think he's going
to shoot for people

12:56.192 --> 12:57.902
he thinks are
the biggest threat.

12:57.985 --> 13:00.446
Who the [bleep] knows
what to expect with Clint, man?

13:00.529 --> 13:02.573
That dude is such an
emotional roller coaster.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.909
He might actually shoot
himself in the foot.

13:05.784 --> 13:06.535
Now that it's just you and I,

13:06.619 --> 13:08.704
I do have a little bit
of a plan.

13:08.787 --> 13:10.706
This is chess, not checkers.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.041
That's kind of the game I've
been playing this whole time.

13:12.124 --> 13:15.503
I'm actually not quite as
emotional as I've been here.

13:15.586 --> 13:18.214
That's my disguise, in a sense.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.049
Well, you're going
to be a target now.

13:20.132 --> 13:21.467
You just won a Flash Challenge,

13:21.550 --> 13:22.927
you've been called out
as far as how good you color is.

13:23.010 --> 13:27.389
So, I'm looking for somebody
that could really go far

13:27.473 --> 13:30.726
but could easily be rattled with
one or two bumps in the road

13:30.809 --> 13:32.770
And Sarah would definitely
be one of them.

13:32.853 --> 13:35.564
She's really good when
she gets her confidence,

13:35.648 --> 13:37.399
and then when that confidence
is shattered a little bit--

13:37.483 --> 13:38.692
{\an5}-Whoomp.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.692
-Yeah.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.695
There's guys at the bottom,
Mark, Kay--

13:41.779 --> 13:42.488
Tray.

13:42.571 --> 13:43.447
They're digging their own grave.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.699
Let the little ones
weed themselves out.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.034
I'm here for the big guys.

13:49.119 --> 13:52.581
[music]

13:59.880 --> 14:03.092
Welcome to this week's
elimination tattoo.

14:03.175 --> 14:06.679
Impress us, and you'll be
one step closer to 100 grand.

14:06.762 --> 14:08.681
You must also impress
all of America.

14:08.764 --> 14:11.433
Viewers at home
will vote for the tattoo

14:11.517 --> 14:14.103
that they think is the best,
using the same criteria

14:14.186 --> 14:14.937
that the judges use.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.482
This week,
we're testing texture.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.776
In the Flash Challenge,
you had to tattoo

14:20.859 --> 14:22.111
a difficult texture.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.904
In the elimination tattoo,
we're testing how well

14:23.988 --> 14:28.617
you replicate texture to
make your tattoo life-like.

14:28.701 --> 14:29.702
<i>I love doing texture.</i>

14:29.785 --> 14:32.955
{\an8}Texture is super important
in all tattoos.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.081
<i>It's what makes a tattoo pop.</i>

14:34.164 --> 14:38.085
If you nail the texture,
you've nailed the tattoo.

14:38.168 --> 14:39.336
For this elimination tattoo,

14:39.420 --> 14:41.505
we want you to terrify us...

14:42.715 --> 14:44.550
With a horror tattoo.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.136
[laughter] [applause]

14:47.219 --> 14:51.223
{\an8}I am ecstatic that this
week we're doing horror images.

14:51.307 --> 14:54.393
{\an8}It is 70% of the work I do.
I'm going to kill it.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.353
Similar to books and films,

14:56.437 --> 14:58.439
horror is a broad style
with one goal in mind,

14:58.522 --> 14:59.773
and that's to scare.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.443
The tattoos look real
using texture

15:02.526 --> 15:04.445
to bring them to life.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.322
Let's meet your canvases.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.993
{\an8}Horror is not a genre
I've done before.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.329
It's looking kind of
funky for your boy.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.165
Clint, because you won
the Flash Challenge,

15:16.248 --> 15:20.502
you now have the power to
assign all the human canvases.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.047
It's up to you who to
trick and who to treat.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.965
You're all screwed. [laughs]

15:25.049 --> 15:26.800
{\an8}My responsibility
when I give out these skulls

15:26.884 --> 15:30.054
{\an8}is to try to [bleep]
as many people as I can.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.430
<i>And that applies to everybody.</i>

15:31.513 --> 15:33.265
You're hot, so I'm probably
not going to tattoo you,

15:33.349 --> 15:34.433
but what are you looking to get?

15:34.516 --> 15:35.684
{\an8}That's Clint. He's a nut job.

15:35.768 --> 15:36.852
<i>He really wants to make</i>
<i>a point that he's here,</i>

15:36.935 --> 15:40.522
it's Clint's day,
and understand that.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.231
What are you
looking to get done?

15:41.315 --> 15:42.191
I want a zombie, with the flesh

15:42.274 --> 15:45.361
ripping off the face
with fire involved.

15:45.444 --> 15:46.362
What are you
looking to get, bro?

15:46.445 --> 15:48.697
A creepy monster
underneath the bed.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.909
{\an8}I do not want the monster
coming from under the bed.

15:51.992 --> 15:54.244
I think I would be [bleep]
in the design.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.579
Oh, you guys.

15:55.663 --> 15:56.580
{\an8}Anybody in front of me,

15:56.664 --> 15:58.123
<i>they're going</i>
<i>to get some [bleep].</i>

15:59.208 --> 16:01.752
{\an8}Clint's not going to
be able to screw me at all.

16:01.835 --> 16:05.047
<i>You can give me a difficult</i>
<i>tattoo and it will look amazing.</i>

16:05.130 --> 16:07.800
So, by all means,
go ahead and target me.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.885
Give me a hard tattoo.
Let me prove myself.

16:09.968 --> 16:12.012
{\an5}-black-and-gray or color?

16:09.968 --> 16:12.012
-black-and-gray.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.514
black-and-gray? [chuckles]

16:13.597 --> 16:14.515
You win.

16:15.474 --> 16:18.435
That's you. [laughs]

16:18.519 --> 16:19.853
Step it up or step it out.

16:19.937 --> 16:22.481
Canvases, one by one,
please reveal the name

16:22.564 --> 16:23.774
on the bottom of your skull.

16:23.857 --> 16:24.233
Clint.

16:24.316 --> 16:25.567
Mark.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.028
Big Daddy Tray.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.488
Tatu Baby.

16:29.571 --> 16:30.823
Jesse.

16:30.906 --> 16:33.283
<i>Jesse gets the monster</i>
<i>under the bed.</i>

16:33.367 --> 16:34.910
I'm happy.
Thank you very much, Clint.

16:34.993 --> 16:36.662
Sebastian.

16:36.745 --> 16:37.746
Jamie.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.081
Steve.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.875
{\an8}Clint gives me the human canvas
that wants a zombie skull.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.585
<i>Clint threw me a bone,</i>
<i>he's my boy.</i>

16:43.669 --> 16:44.962
You couldn't have
picked it better for me.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.380
Lalo.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.132
{\an5}-Kay.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.132
-Sarah.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.969
<i>Clint is trying</i>
<i>to throw me under the bus.</i>

16:52.052 --> 16:54.847
{\an8}I've only done color
tattoos up till this point.

16:54.930 --> 16:57.057
<i>He doesn't realize that</i>
<i>I can rock black-and-gray</i>

16:57.141 --> 16:59.768
just as well as I can do color.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.937
You all have the rest
of the evening to consult

17:02.020 --> 17:03.480
with your human canvases.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.441
Tomorrow,
you will have six hours

17:05.523 --> 17:07.443
to complete your horror tattoo,

17:07.526 --> 17:08.152
and based on your work,

17:08.234 --> 17:11.070
one of you will be closing shop.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.323
Good luck.

17:13.406 --> 17:15.951
<i>Texture's a way of</i>
<i>taking a flat surface</i>

17:16.034 --> 17:18.954
{\an8}and making it look like whatever
surface you're conveying.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.957
<i>In a tattoo, you always</i>
<i>have to make things</i>

17:22.040 --> 17:24.292
appear like they're really
moving, or they're grainy,

17:24.376 --> 17:25.419
<i>or they're wet--</i>
<i>whatever the texture may be.</i>

17:25.502 --> 17:27.628
You have to be able
to convey that onto the skin.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.924
Your idea fits my style.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.635
{\an8}This is my [bleep] chance
to [bleep] back at some people.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.721
{\an8}My chance to move up
in this damn thing.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.806
If I can do a cool vampire girl

17:37.890 --> 17:39.141
with maybe her hand
in front of her...

17:39.224 --> 17:41.310
{\an5}-Okay.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.310
-Blood, good vampire eyes...

17:41.393 --> 17:42.561
I'm not [bleep] around.

17:42.644 --> 17:43.979
<i>I can guarantee you right now,</i>

17:44.062 --> 17:45.606
I'm going to [bleep]
kill this thing.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.317
I'm looking to get an evil face.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.401
{\an5}-Alright.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.401
-Gory.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.653
Maybe some cloth
and torn bandages,

17:51.737 --> 17:55.324
some stitches,
maybe a bug or two crawling out.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.784
We should be able
to tear that up.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.577
Do you want her to look pretty
with her face [bleep] up?

17:58.660 --> 17:59.703
{\an5}-Yeah, I mean, if we...

17:58.660 --> 17:59.703
-Or do you want her

17:59.787 --> 18:00.871
to look scary?

18:00.954 --> 18:02.623
She can't be elegant scary.

18:02.706 --> 18:03.999
Elegant horror. We need scary.

18:04.082 --> 18:05.834
<i>My client wants a zombie girl.</i>

18:05.918 --> 18:07.711
{\an8}She wants it to look sexy.

18:07.795 --> 18:10.088
I don't know, man.

18:10.172 --> 18:11.799
This seems really elegant to me.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.218
We going for horror.
We're not scaring me at all.

18:14.301 --> 18:16.845
Let me tell you the first
issue I got with your piece.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.222
If you have a monster
under the bed,

18:18.305 --> 18:20.390
the more time we spend on
the bed and all that stuff,

18:20.474 --> 18:22.309
the less time we get to
spend on the actual monster.

18:22.392 --> 18:24.061
I honestly think
that what we should do

18:24.144 --> 18:26.313
is spend more time on
getting the head done.

18:26.396 --> 18:27.856
{\an5}-Are you cool with that?

18:26.396 --> 18:27.856
-Yeah, I'm, definitely.

18:27.940 --> 18:28.690
Okay, awesome.

18:28.774 --> 18:29.858
I'd like to show you
some of my work

18:29.942 --> 18:31.735
so you can kind of get an idea
of what I got going on.

18:31.819 --> 18:32.694
What do you think
about his eyes?

18:32.778 --> 18:33.362
{\an5}-No? Yes?

18:32.778 --> 18:33.362
-Nah.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.030
{\an5}-The mouth.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.030
-Nay.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.199
{\an8}My canvas definitely
knows what he doesn't want.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.367
{\an5}-Eyes?

18:37.282 --> 18:38.367
-Mm-mmm.

18:38.450 --> 18:41.870
What he doesn't want
is everything that I suggest.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.622
<i>Everything I throw out,</i>
<i>he's just not feeling.</i>

18:43.705 --> 18:46.708
Mm, nah.
The other's more droopy.

18:46.792 --> 18:47.876
It's a mind [bleep] for me.
I'm screwed.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.212
How's yours going, bro?
What you got?

18:50.295 --> 18:50.921
I got that vampire chick.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.130
I'm glad I didn't get a color.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.341
I mean, I could do it,
but I'm more freedom

18:54.424 --> 18:55.926
with the black-and-gray
to get texture.

18:56.009 --> 18:57.553
With color, you've got to keep
working the texture

18:57.636 --> 18:58.929
{\an5}-with highlights and [bleep].

18:57.636 --> 18:58.929
-That's what I did to Sarah.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.389
She rocked it
with a color piece.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.475
Well, now you got to step it up
and do a black-and-gray piece.

19:03.559 --> 19:06.103
I'm testing a lot of people too.
This is a [bleep] game.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.063
{\an8}Clint's strategy is
basically to try to knock off

19:08.146 --> 19:10.357
people that do
his style of work,

19:10.440 --> 19:12.276
and if he can knock one of those
guys down a little bit,

19:12.359 --> 19:13.735
<i>he elevates himself.</i>

19:13.819 --> 19:16.113
And if they fall,
then let's get rid of 'em.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.407
It's time to step up
or step the [bleep] out.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.534
Watch me go home on this one.

19:20.617 --> 19:22.619
Watch me go home on this one.

19:22.703 --> 19:23.203
That'd be my [bleep] luck.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.169
{\an5}-What up?

19:29.835 --> 19:31.169
-What up, man?

19:31.253 --> 19:33.172
So how are you
feeling about this?

19:33.255 --> 19:35.007
I want to make sure I finish
in the six hours today, man.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.759
I told her I'd have
three sizes for her.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.219
Which one are you going to do?

19:39.303 --> 19:41.346
Well, I don't think
she'll want the big one.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.389
She's going to go
one of these two for sure.

19:44.516 --> 19:45.684
You can't do that one.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.603
Huh. It's too small.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.229
You've got to go
at least that big, man.

19:50.731 --> 19:51.607
But I don't think
I'll have time.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.066
Gotta set it off.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.235
She seems pretty open, man.

19:55.319 --> 19:58.572
So I'm going to try and talk her
into the biggest one.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.616
Go big or go home.

20:00.699 --> 20:01.283

to be like you one day.

20:01.366 --> 20:02.743
Yeah. Well, good luck, man.

20:02.826 --> 20:04.912
You too, brother.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.289
See you in six hours.

20:07.372 --> 20:10.626
Yes, sir.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.253
Today, you must create
a horror tattoo.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.338
Remember, we're testing texture.

20:14.421 --> 20:18.342
If the blood and the Gore
doesn't come to life,

20:18.425 --> 20:19.760
you'll be headed home.

20:19.843 --> 20:22.596
You have six hours to tattoo,

20:22.679 --> 20:26.183
and your time starts... Now.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.519
Alright, let's put
this bad boy on here.

in a horror tattoo,

<i>all use of shading, highlights,</i>

20:33.231 --> 20:36.109
and contrasting colors
to make it look like

20:36.193 --> 20:37.110
that blood is dripping.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.403
<i>Make something look wet.</i>

20:38.487 --> 20:41.114
<i>You can show a wide range</i>
<i>of tattooing skills</i>

20:41.198 --> 20:42.991
to bring these textures to life.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.202

<i>bloody, gory, demon-like.</i>

20:50.832 --> 20:52.709

<i>the best stuff I do.</i>

20:52.793 --> 20:55.253
<i>I'm really,</i>
<i>super happy about this.</i>

20:55.337 --> 20:56.171
Everything you do
is a horror flick.

20:56.254 --> 20:59.341
Who here does horror?
Point to Steve.

20:59.424 --> 21:01.635
[laughs]

21:01.718 --> 21:03.804
<i>I think that horror</i>
<i>could probably</i>

21:03.887 --> 21:05.806
{\an8}be portrayed in most styles.

21:05.889 --> 21:07.391
What do you think?
Want me to put this on you?

21:07.474 --> 21:08.392
That's awesome.

21:08.475 --> 21:09.810
{\an5}-You like it?

21:08.475 --> 21:09.810
-Yeah.

21:09.893 --> 21:12.187
<i>Any time I get the opportunity</i>
<i>to draw something in my style</i>

21:12.270 --> 21:14.606

<i>Steve has the advantage</i>
<i>of this challenge.</i>

This is what he does.
That's his MO

21:18.860 --> 21:20.904
I hate you.

21:20.988 --> 21:21.738
I hate you, too.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.490
My biggest threat
is Jesse Smith.

<i>At what he does,</i>

21:24.700 --> 21:25.742

<i>four to five different styles.</i>

you have to be versatile.

21:32.749 --> 21:35.794

21:37.462 --> 21:40.549
I never realized how much
detail is in that [bleep]

21:40.632 --> 21:43.343
Until I start doing it.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.012
{\an8}I like the design
that I come up with,

21:45.095 --> 21:47.389
<i>but it's kind of difficult,</i>
<i>it's kind of complex.</i>

21:47.472 --> 21:48.724
<i>I just hope</i> <i>that it comes</i>
<i>across</i>

21:48.807 --> 21:50.017
the way I see it in my head
on the skin.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.936
It took me a minute to even find
my way in this mother[bleep].

21:53.020 --> 21:54.438
Hopefully I can just
stay out of the bottom, period.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.650

<i>in tattooing gory,</i>

out of people.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.661
So much for that
stencil of that hair.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.080
You have no faith in me.

<i>For me to even think about</i>
<i>dropping the ball, right now,</i>

of the hair is gone.

<i>This tattoo is just</i>
<i>not coming together.</i>

He tried to draw a lot of
the elements himself,

and the proportions,
and the sides of the head,

22:23.925 --> 22:25.427
and the shape of the neck
are just all wrong,

Brain matter, muscle tissue,
pus, blood...

24:42.147 --> 24:44.191
It's a lot of texture.

24:44.274 --> 24:45.942
And a lot of texture
takes a lot of time.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.194
I got six hours,
and in the amount of time

24:47.277 --> 24:49.738
I can do, this is what I got.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.073
I have to make sure that
I can finish this tattoo.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.743
Ten seconds.

24:54.826 --> 24:58.496
Nine, eight, seven, six,

24:58.580 --> 25:01.750
five, four, three, two,

25:01.833 --> 25:03.585
one.

25:03.668 --> 25:06.087
That's it.
Time's up. No more ink.

25:06.504 --> 25:08.465
Good job.

25:08.548 --> 25:09.591
I've definitely hit
the nail on the head.

25:09.674 --> 25:13.595
I've got tons and tons of
texture in my tattoo

25:13.678 --> 25:16.306
and I think it looks
really [bleep] good.

25:17.557 --> 25:19.768
I am very [bleep] worried that
I bit off a little more than

25:19.851 --> 25:23.230
I could chew, with the time
restraint and my design.

25:23.313 --> 25:25.774
All I can do is hope to God
that somebody drops the ball.

25:28.485 --> 25:29.319
{\an5}-What do you think?

25:28.485 --> 25:29.319
-Aw, yeah.

25:29.402 --> 25:32.822
{\an5}-You like that?

25:29.402 --> 25:32.822
-Yeah, absolutely, man.

25:32.906 --> 25:35.242
I wanted to do a tattoo
for the world to see

25:35.325 --> 25:36.952
that screams Big Daddy Tray,

25:37.035 --> 25:38.662
and that's why I put FTW in it--

25:38.745 --> 25:39.537
"[bleep] the world."

25:39.621 --> 25:41.373
So if they decide
to send me home,

25:41.915 --> 25:42.832
I'm good with that.

25:46.127 --> 25:49.172
{\an8}To be honest, I do think that
you deserve to go downstairs.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.924
{\an8}Are you letting me
finish talking?

25:51.007 --> 25:52.133
The only thing that
would have saved this face

25:52.217 --> 25:53.468
is a different one.

25:53.551 --> 25:55.845
This is not <i> Ink Master</i> ...
Anything.

25:56.179 --> 25:59.766
[music]

26:04.604 --> 26:05.230
I think I'm in trouble.

26:05.313 --> 26:07.399
Mark, you were the only one

26:07.482 --> 26:10.151
who didn't have texture
in their tattoo.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.820
If they don't call you...

26:11.903 --> 26:14.614
Wow.

26:14.698 --> 26:17.242
{\an5}-"If they don't call you."

26:14.698 --> 26:17.242
-Chill, I'm just saying.

26:17.325 --> 26:19.577
My tattoo came nowhere near
what I envisioned in my mind,

26:19.661 --> 26:22.664
<i>but I don't want</i>
<i>Tatu Baby's opinion.</i>

26:22.747 --> 26:25.041
You just basically told me
"You deserve to go downstairs."

26:25.125 --> 26:26.543
Well, to be honest, I do think

26:26.626 --> 26:28.003
that you deserve
to go downstairs

26:28.086 --> 26:29.504
because, to me,
you didn't have the depth

26:29.587 --> 26:31.381
that everybody else's
tattoos did.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.508
Talk to me how you want to be
talked to,<i> por favor.</i>

26:33.591 --> 26:35.427
<i>If everybody in the house starts</i>
<i>fighting with each other</i>

26:35.510 --> 26:37.470
<i>and everybody's trying to</i>
<i>throw each other off their game,</i>

26:37.554 --> 26:40.849
{\an8}all I got to do is focus on me
and worry about my [bleep].

26:40.932 --> 26:42.267
You want to get all defensive,

26:42.350 --> 26:43.643
I'm just having
a conversation, to be honest.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.353
Am I the one raising my voice?

26:45.437 --> 26:47.314
Well, you just got all defensive
and then I'm going to tell you.

26:47.397 --> 26:48.606
This is raising my voice,

26:48.690 --> 26:50.650
and that's what you did
when you spoke to me.

26:50.734 --> 26:51.985
<i>Let them scrap it out.</i>

26:52.068 --> 26:52.652
Whatever's going to help me out.

26:52.736 --> 26:53.695
{\an5}-Exactly,

26:52.736 --> 26:53.695
-To get--

26:53.778 --> 26:55.780
{\an5}-That's exactly how I felt.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.780
-To get some--

26:55.864 --> 26:57.365
{\an5}-just like if you told me...

26:55.864 --> 26:57.365
-All I did was ask you a few--

26:57.449 --> 26:59.534
my tattoo's ugly as hell,
I'd be like, "Alright, fine."

26:59.617 --> 27:01.369
Are you letting me
finish talking,

27:01.453 --> 27:03.371
or are you continuing your trend

27:03.455 --> 27:07.125
of talking above someone
so that you can be heard?

27:07.208 --> 27:08.585
{\an5}-So now he wants to scream.

27:07.208 --> 27:08.585
-Be real.

27:12.464 --> 27:12.714
I was thinking about dough nuts.

27:14.966 --> 27:17.844
{\an8}[rock music]

27:30.023 --> 27:33.735
This week, we asked you
to create a horror tattoo.

27:33.818 --> 27:34.736
We were testing texture.

27:35.945 --> 27:36.738
Clint, you won
the Flash Challenge,

27:36.821 --> 27:38.656
and had ultimate power.
You're up first.

27:41.242 --> 27:43.703
Well, Clint,

27:43.787 --> 27:44.871
I feel like you lost it.

27:44.954 --> 27:46.706
What happened to
the back of her head?

27:46.790 --> 27:47.957
Just collapsed in.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.417
On which side,
the right or left?

27:49.501 --> 27:51.294
Her head right here.
There's no ear,

27:51.378 --> 27:53.463
there's no cheek,
there's no head.

27:53.546 --> 27:54.881
Her hair would be back here.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.591
The stencil was
falling away on it.

27:56.674 --> 27:58.468
If you can't get
textures in the face,

27:58.551 --> 27:59.594
or in the blood or the hands,

27:59.677 --> 28:01.513
where's the place
you can shine for texture?

28:01.596 --> 28:03.473
Hair.
Did you just abandon ship?

28:03.556 --> 28:05.975
I think for, as limited
as the tattoo was,

28:06.059 --> 28:06.893
I did fairly well.

28:06.976 --> 28:07.560
No, but your challenge
is texture.

28:07.644 --> 28:08.812
You've got to do the hair.

28:08.895 --> 28:11.189
You've got to make that hair
look feathery and blowing.

28:11.272 --> 28:12.273
Did I drop the ball?

28:12.357 --> 28:14.067
You didn't do texture.

28:16.611 --> 28:17.529
Jamie.

28:19.364 --> 28:20.657
I love the tattoo,
and the texture

28:20.740 --> 28:24.494
all over this thing
is really, really well done.

28:24.577 --> 28:28.123
My issue with the piece
is that it's difficult to read

28:28.206 --> 28:29.457
unless you're right up on it.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.626
I was trying to get so much
stuff in there for the guy.

28:31.709 --> 28:33.962
It's kind of
the same tone throughout.

28:34.045 --> 28:36.214
There could have been some
really heavy dark spot

28:36.297 --> 28:37.465
and then lighter tones to make

28:37.549 --> 28:39.300
these muscle structures
stand out.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.010
If you had done
the head really dark,

28:41.094 --> 28:43.096
the chest really dark,
kind of like a wolf,

28:43.179 --> 28:45.306
then this tattoo would
look completely different.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.267
It would definitely have
a lot more strength to it.

28:48.309 --> 28:49.978
Kay Kutta.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.982
You had a really
tough tattoo, man.

28:54.065 --> 28:55.692
That's a [bleep] crazy design,

28:55.775 --> 28:56.818
and it's disturbing.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.153
There's a real lack of
detail in the brain

28:58.236 --> 29:00.488
and the intestines.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.699
This is texture.
That was your point, man.

29:02.782 --> 29:04.659
I feel like that face
is so dark,

29:04.742 --> 29:06.327
and then the chest
and shoulder area

29:06.411 --> 29:09.330
and the skin tone in the rest of
the tattoo is just so light.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.498
It's just barely there.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.709
My intention was for the face
to be in the forefront,

29:12.792 --> 29:15.044
and all the attention
drawn there,

29:15.128 --> 29:17.005
and I see the design flaws.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.923
It doesn't really come across
like I intended, but...

29:19.007 --> 29:21.050
The back should be
much darker than the front.

29:21.134 --> 29:23.344
That's off in the distance.
If we look over there,

29:23.428 --> 29:24.512
what's over there
is way darker than you.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.765
That design flaw
really hurts you.

29:27.849 --> 29:30.018
I know what you're seeing
and what you're trying to do.

29:30.101 --> 29:31.394
You're just not hitting it.

29:33.646 --> 29:34.564
Sarah.

29:35.773 --> 29:37.692
You finished what
you set out to do,

29:37.775 --> 29:40.987
had extra time, and then
added on elements to this piece.

29:41.070 --> 29:42.113
I think it came out really good

29:42.197 --> 29:42.989
and the extra elements
that we added

29:43.072 --> 29:44.657
made the whole theme
come together.

29:44.741 --> 29:47.076
I think you got
done early because

29:47.160 --> 29:50.038
you missed detailing out
things to a higher level.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.040
The hair is definitely
what throws me in this.

29:52.123 --> 29:54.709
With heavier black, his face
would have jumped off there

29:54.792 --> 29:56.711
because it would have
been a nice, heavy look.

29:56.794 --> 29:58.421
The mouth on this
thing's incredible.

29:58.505 --> 29:59.797
The teeth and the wetness,
the tongue.

29:59.881 --> 30:02.842
You definitely are able
to capture texture,

30:02.926 --> 30:05.386
but if you put that much
attention into this part,

30:05.470 --> 30:06.763
then put it into the rest,

30:06.846 --> 30:08.890
because then
you have a stand-clear winner.

30:08.973 --> 30:10.391
Right now,
there's room for dispute.

30:12.977 --> 30:14.395
Sebastian, come on up, man.

30:16.397 --> 30:17.524
How did you guys
settle on this design?

30:17.607 --> 30:19.484
It's like, "Hey, you know,
let's do a picture of you."

30:19.567 --> 30:20.985
Her hair wasn't quite like this.

30:21.069 --> 30:23.988
I was trying to make sure
I could get that texture good.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.448
If you can do all
that texture in the face,

30:25.532 --> 30:26.741
then you can do hair.

30:26.824 --> 30:29.577
Her hair was pretty big,
and I didn't think

30:29.661 --> 30:31.371
I was going to have enough time
to try to go way out.

30:31.454 --> 30:32.622
This looks like a puff,

30:32.705 --> 30:35.083
and then the weird little
scratchy outline

30:35.166 --> 30:37.085
and shading on the top,
it just makes it look like

30:37.168 --> 30:39.337
a big, thick river
of nothing up there.

30:39.420 --> 30:41.589
If we tell you to
do a challenge and do texture,

30:41.673 --> 30:43.258
don't abandon the rest
of your tattoo

30:43.341 --> 30:44.300
because you're not going to win.

30:44.384 --> 30:45.635
You didn't do a finished tattoo.

30:47.303 --> 30:48.221
Steve.

30:49.847 --> 30:50.682
I like the way you layer.

30:50.765 --> 30:52.767
You can see it
in the undertones.

30:52.850 --> 30:53.977
You do a really dark area,
almost a field of black,

30:54.060 --> 30:56.563
but then you still get this
darker layer behind it

30:56.646 --> 30:59.274
where you really add the texture

30:59.357 --> 31:00.400
and you really
make those little pits.

31:00.483 --> 31:03.403
The real look of death
you get in the eye socket

31:03.486 --> 31:06.948
and the back of the mouth really
make this thing stand out.

31:07.031 --> 31:09.033
We're looking for texture.
This is texture.

31:10.368 --> 31:13.037
Lalo.

31:13.121 --> 31:15.999
Where you're coming up short
is your color saturation

31:16.082 --> 31:19.669
and your lack of black outline
or heavy, dark areas.

31:19.752 --> 31:22.672
You're just not
hitting that mark.

31:22.755 --> 31:24.632
I have a very painterly
approach to things.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.968
Sounds like a cop-out
to being sloppy.

31:27.051 --> 31:30.305
I just don't feel like this
painterly point of view

31:30.388 --> 31:32.015
is accomplishing the challenges

31:32.098 --> 31:34.058
that are being set forth
in this competition.

31:36.352 --> 31:38.313
Tatu Baby.

31:38.396 --> 31:41.608
Where you lost me a little bit
is on the eyes and the hair.

31:41.691 --> 31:42.817
Not a lot of detail in the hair.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.485
It could have been
a little more textured.

31:44.569 --> 31:45.862
You see her hair
in her bottom right

31:45.945 --> 31:46.988
has a little more texture

31:47.071 --> 31:48.740
{\an5}-I wish it had that.

31:47.071 --> 31:48.740
-and detail and streaks...

31:48.823 --> 31:50.116
This is a really big piece.

31:50.199 --> 31:51.534
Maybe I bit off
more than I could chew.

31:51.618 --> 31:53.661
Design this tattoo
that you can finish

31:53.745 --> 31:54.912
in the amount of time.

31:54.996 --> 31:57.498
The room for you
to mismanage your time

31:57.582 --> 32:00.293
and you to not detail
these things out is gone.

32:02.086 --> 32:02.128
Tray.

32:03.588 --> 32:06.049
As far as texture goes,

32:06.132 --> 32:08.092
there's no texture
at all in this.

32:09.135 --> 32:10.178
Can you do texture?

32:10.261 --> 32:12.513
Yeah, but sometimes I overdo it,

32:12.597 --> 32:13.389
and I didn't want to overdo
this tattoo.

32:13.473 --> 32:16.142
You didn't give me
anything to judge.

32:16.225 --> 32:17.602
Bone has that
bone fragment texture.

32:17.685 --> 32:20.563
You should have put some breaks.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.440
You could have put
the texture in the crack,

32:22.523 --> 32:23.399
you could have put the texture

32:23.483 --> 32:25.610
in the cross-cut
feature of the bone.

32:25.693 --> 32:27.153
Just little details like that

32:27.236 --> 32:28.071
would have completed
this challenge.

32:31.157 --> 32:32.784
Jesse.

32:32.867 --> 32:34.535
Jesse, you did a great,
crazy, texturized,

32:34.619 --> 32:35.828
color depth tattoo.

32:35.912 --> 32:38.289
Any time I get
an opportunity to use color,

32:38.373 --> 32:39.832
it's going to work out
to my advantage.

32:39.916 --> 32:42.794
A lot of detail
from top to bottom.

32:42.877 --> 32:45.046
There's not a section of this
tattoo that I can pick out

32:45.129 --> 32:47.131
and say, "You should have
spent more time there."

32:47.215 --> 32:49.384
The colors really
bounce off of each other.

32:49.467 --> 32:50.968
Everything
just lights up nicely.

32:51.052 --> 32:51.094
Thank you.

32:52.679 --> 32:53.596
Mark.

32:55.556 --> 32:57.642
The shading in the head
and in the face

32:57.725 --> 33:01.104
is so wall-to-wall and solid,

33:01.187 --> 33:02.689
you actually hurt yourself.

33:03.481 --> 33:04.399
You lost it.

33:04.482 --> 33:07.443
That cover-up feel,
it's a big, dark tattoo.

33:07.527 --> 33:08.194
Came down
to a time management thing.

33:08.277 --> 33:10.363
No, your time--
I disagree.

33:10.446 --> 33:11.406
Your time isn't going
to save this tattoo.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.074
The only thing that
would have saved this face

33:13.157 --> 33:14.909
is a different one.

33:14.992 --> 33:16.160
This is not <i> Ink Master.</i> ..
Anything.

33:19.914 --> 33:20.957
Alright, guys.
Head back to the loft.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.626
For one of you,
it will be your last visit.

33:23.710 --> 33:25.837
Because when you return,
one of you will be

33:25.920 --> 33:28.381
packing up your machines
and closing shop.

33:28.464 --> 33:30.049
We'll call you back
when we've made a decision.

33:30.133 --> 33:33.094
[music]

33:37.598 --> 33:39.600
You know, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime chance

33:39.684 --> 33:41.269
to be on something like this.

33:41.352 --> 33:43.312
Even though it's hard on me.

33:43.396 --> 33:44.939
Why, what's going on, Tray?

33:45.022 --> 33:47.734
Well, before I came,
I had surgery.

33:47.817 --> 33:50.069
I got blood clots
from the surgery.

33:50.153 --> 33:53.698
Then yesterday,
my blood pressure skyrocketed

33:53.781 --> 33:55.908
and I lost vision
in my right eye.

33:55.992 --> 33:57.118
{\an5}-What?

33:55.992 --> 33:57.118
-Holy [bleep].

33:57.201 --> 33:59.245
which has happened before,
so I didn't tell nobody.

33:59.328 --> 34:02.790
Before I came, I took it upon
myself to say, "[bleep] it.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.543
I'll just leave all
my medicines behind," you know?

34:05.626 --> 34:06.711
Why would you do that?

34:07.378 --> 34:09.255
{\an8}If you develop blood clots

34:09.338 --> 34:10.630
<i>and you do not</i>
<i>have proper medication,</i>

34:10.715 --> 34:12.800
[snaps] You could die like that.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.886
I wanted to make my kids proud,

34:14.969 --> 34:16.262
I wanted them to see their daddy
on something like this.

34:16.344 --> 34:20.766
So for me to die doing something
for my kids and love,

34:20.850 --> 34:22.518
I'm willing to do that.

34:22.601 --> 34:23.770
A blood clot isn't something
to [bleep] around with.

34:23.853 --> 34:25.103
I can't believe
you didn't come here

34:25.188 --> 34:26.981
with your medicine
in the first [bleep] place.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.900
I think I'll be fine.
I'm fine today.

34:28.983 --> 34:32.487
{\an5}-Just take care of yourself.

34:28.983 --> 34:32.487
-Alright.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.112
I think if I just get
my blood pressure down,

34:34.197 --> 34:34.739
{\an5}-I'll probably be alright.

34:34.197 --> 34:34.739
-[thud]

34:34.822 --> 34:36.991
{\an5}-Tray!

34:34.822 --> 34:36.991
-Whoa. Whoa.

34:37.074 --> 34:38.034
[bleep].

34:38.117 --> 34:41.536
[sirens wailing]

34:44.748 --> 34:48.503
[sirens wailing]

34:48.585 --> 34:50.545
It takes me by surprise
when they have to

34:50.630 --> 34:52.632
take Tray to the hospital.

34:52.715 --> 34:54.050
He said his right eye
went blind.

34:54.132 --> 34:56.094
You can't [bleep] around
with that [bleep], man.

34:56.177 --> 34:57.178
I'm, like, "Holy [bleep]."

34:57.261 --> 34:58.262
This is a really,
really crazy situation.

34:58.346 --> 35:01.849
He blew out his intestine
before he came here.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.601
<i>I'm really worried.</i>

35:03.684 --> 35:05.269
This is really serious.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.730
{\an5}-He's had a rough road, man.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.730
-But he's made it this far.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.899
That's not gonna
save anybody from elimination,

35:09.982 --> 35:11.651
so don't anybody
get their hopes up.

35:16.072 --> 35:18.366
Let's get into
our tops and bottoms.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.201
Kay Kutta's on the bottom.
Tattoo is just atrociously done.

35:20.284 --> 35:24.330
His skill level is not there
to accomplish this tattoo.

35:24.413 --> 35:28.459
Even his best example of texture
is not really done well.

35:28.543 --> 35:30.711
I'm seeing Kay, I'm seeing Mark.

35:30.795 --> 35:33.047
Mark, he got a realistic hand
and a face that would just

35:33.130 --> 35:36.008
never exist in any life
here or hereafter.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.885
No, dude, this thing's
ugly as hell.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.054
I stood 20 feet from it
and looked,

35:40.137 --> 35:41.347
and it was just
a black-green silhouette.

35:41.430 --> 35:43.558
Painfully obvious
that this one is wrong.

35:43.641 --> 35:44.725
And I'm seeing Tray.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.227
Tray isn't here due
to a medical emergency.

35:46.310 --> 35:49.063
A blood clot isn't something
to [bleep] around with.

35:49.146 --> 35:50.398
I think I'll be fine.

35:50.481 --> 35:51.732
{\an5}-[thud]

35:50.481 --> 35:51.732
-Tray!

35:51.816 --> 35:53.025
[sirens wailing]

35:53.109 --> 35:54.068
{\an5}-Tray's out?

35:53.109 --> 35:54.068
-Yeah, he's out.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.361
Oh, [bleep].

35:55.444 --> 35:57.738
Given this and given some
of the problems he's run into--

35:57.822 --> 36:00.408
how much further do you think
he can go in this competition?

36:00.491 --> 36:01.659
His drawing has hindered him
the whole time.

36:01.742 --> 36:03.244
He is not an artist.

36:03.327 --> 36:04.912
A few little tricks,
he could have made this tattoo

36:04.996 --> 36:07.248
fit this challenge a lot better.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.749
My honest opinion is he can't.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.585
It has a lot of shading,
it has no texture.

36:10.668 --> 36:12.628
These guys, every one of them
is missing an element.

36:12.712 --> 36:13.754
They'll do one section
of their tattoo nice

36:13.838 --> 36:16.090
and then botch the rest.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.343
I feel overall,
with texture in mind,

36:19.427 --> 36:21.095
Steve's at my top. I love it.

36:21.178 --> 36:22.388
If you go into
those eye sockets,

36:22.471 --> 36:24.557
you see the layer
and layer and layer.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.142
It just gets
blacker and blacker.

36:26.225 --> 36:26.934
That's where he's excelling.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.145
I'm more leaning towards Jesse.

36:29.228 --> 36:30.479
I like Jesse's tattoo a lot.

36:30.563 --> 36:33.107
He finally balanced
his color palette properly.

36:33.190 --> 36:35.943
This is the first time that
he didn't do a muted tattoo.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.654
The texture in this back
of the cheek and the horn,

36:38.738 --> 36:40.072
it's really cool.

36:40.156 --> 36:42.366
Interesting thing with
Jesse versus Steve on this

36:42.450 --> 36:44.702
and the use of texture
is Steve's image

36:44.785 --> 36:46.412
was the head deteriorating.

36:46.495 --> 36:48.289
You have bone, you have flesh,
you have teeth.

36:48.372 --> 36:53.294
Jesse had a bear, the horned
tongue, tentacles, skin.

36:53.377 --> 36:56.130
He had more elements
to show texture.

36:56.213 --> 36:58.090
{\an5}-It's a big, bad-ass tattoo.

36:56.213 --> 36:58.090
-I think we're ready.

36:58.174 --> 37:00.092
Do you wanna head over
to the loft and pick them up?

37:03.888 --> 37:05.681
[door closes]

37:05.765 --> 37:07.058
[exhales]

37:07.141 --> 37:11.103
Alright, the judges
need to see Jesse, Mark, Kay...

37:11.187 --> 37:12.271
[sighs]

37:12.355 --> 37:13.481
And Steve.

37:13.564 --> 37:14.732
See you all in the shop.

37:16.943 --> 37:18.611
[door closes]

37:18.694 --> 37:20.905
<i>There's some real bull[bleep]</i>
<i>going downstairs.</i>

37:20.988 --> 37:23.324
{\an8}If Tray was here, it'd be
him going down and not me.

37:23.407 --> 37:25.952
You've proven a lot
in this competition, man.

37:26.035 --> 37:28.496
I don't mean to jinx it but they
like what you've been doing.

37:28.579 --> 37:31.582
{\an5}-Wrong compliment, wrong time.

37:28.579 --> 37:31.582
-Yeah?

37:31.666 --> 37:33.334
Here we go.
I think it's some bull[bleep]

37:33.417 --> 37:35.294
that I have to be down there
just to fill a spot.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.508
[music]

37:46.430 --> 37:47.431
Two of you impressed us.

37:49.183 --> 37:50.851
Two of you did not.

37:51.310 --> 37:53.270
Jesse and Steve.

37:53.354 --> 37:56.857
You guys have
the top two tattoos.

37:56.941 --> 37:59.902
The judges have decided that
the best tattoo of the day...

38:02.363 --> 38:04.365
{\an5}-Goes to Steve.

38:02.363 --> 38:04.365
-Good job, man.

38:04.448 --> 38:07.076
There's an obvious trend.
You guys are battling.

38:07.159 --> 38:08.869
You guys obviously know that

38:08.953 --> 38:10.037
you keep rivaling
back and forth.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.832
But the bottom line is
that we've seen you do color

38:12.915 --> 38:14.417
and we haven't seen you
do black-and-gray, Jesse.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.877
You gotta fight back soon, man.
And it's coming.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.629
I wanna see you guys
do some [bleep].

38:21.048 --> 38:23.384
Mark and Kay.

38:23.467 --> 38:26.554
The judges feel that
your tattoos failed miserably.

38:26.637 --> 38:29.223
There is one other tattoo
that was in the bottom this week

38:29.306 --> 38:30.558
and that was Tray's.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.893
We've heard from the hospital,
and Tray is cleared to return

38:32.977 --> 38:34.103
to the competition.

38:34.186 --> 38:37.690
However, he's also up for
elimination with the two of you.

38:37.773 --> 38:38.816
Mark.

38:38.899 --> 38:40.192
I'm not ready to quit fighting.

38:40.276 --> 38:41.318
I've learned from the mistakes
that I've made step by step.

38:41.402 --> 38:43.738
One thing that
I've been trying to do

38:43.821 --> 38:45.072
is go big or go home.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.657
I've been shooting myself
in the foot.

38:46.741 --> 38:49.076
You have not shown up
for eagles.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.037
You have not shown up for roses.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.413
You have not shown up.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.373
It's brutal, it's honest,
but it's a fact.

38:54.457 --> 38:55.583
I don't mind being the underdog.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.585
I been the underdog
a lot of times in my life,

38:57.668 --> 38:59.545
and I did everything
I could to rise.

38:59.628 --> 39:02.048
I'm capable of doing a lot more
than what I've shown.

39:02.131 --> 39:02.923
Give me one more round.

39:03.007 --> 39:05.051
Let me show you
I can land that punch.

39:05.134 --> 39:06.385
There's a guy standing there

39:06.469 --> 39:08.095
who's only been
tattooing three years

39:08.179 --> 39:10.306
that puts his heart and soul
into everything he does,

39:10.389 --> 39:11.307
whether it's right or wrong.

39:11.390 --> 39:13.017
But we can all say
the guy's got heart.

39:13.684 --> 39:14.643
Kay.

39:14.727 --> 39:15.770
This man's a fighter
in real life,

39:15.853 --> 39:17.271
but I've been a fighter
in this competition.

39:17.355 --> 39:18.481
I think I'm a better artist.

39:18.564 --> 39:20.441
Everything you guys told me
to apply, I've done it.

39:20.524 --> 39:21.442
Everything you've got,
you've scrapped for it.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.569
I don't want to see you
give up that fight.

39:23.652 --> 39:26.280
You go home, I wanna see you
fight it tooth and nail, man.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.157
I just wanna keep fighting, man.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.117
The man to your left
[bleep] the bed

39:30.201 --> 39:32.661
and did some random-ass
cover-up darkness,

39:32.745 --> 39:34.121
and I don't like it.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.207
The man to your left
has better application

39:36.290 --> 39:38.584
and better tattoo fundamentals.

39:38.667 --> 39:40.628
That's a tough pill to swallow,
but it's a fact.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.421
There was another tattoo
that you guys said

39:42.505 --> 39:44.048
had absolutely no texture
at all in the texture challenge.

39:44.131 --> 39:46.884
I mean, just to be honest.

39:46.967 --> 39:48.761
You actually bring up
some interesting points.

39:48.844 --> 39:51.680
Tray's tattoo is also
in the bottom three.

39:51.764 --> 39:52.765
Tray didn't do any texture.

39:52.848 --> 39:56.811
His tattoo was more solid
and more consistent.

39:56.894 --> 39:58.187
He just didn't do any texture.

40:00.356 --> 40:01.649
The judges have decided...

40:01.732 --> 40:04.110
[dramatic music]

40:06.070 --> 40:09.406
That Tray does not have
what it takes to be <i> Ink Master</i> .

40:11.200 --> 40:13.702
Kay, the only reason you're here

40:13.786 --> 40:15.246
is 'cause he didn't do
any texture.

40:15.329 --> 40:16.455
That saved your ass.

40:16.539 --> 40:17.790
There's not a competitor
that should have any confidence

40:17.873 --> 40:19.583
right now.

40:19.667 --> 40:20.835
The real fight is coming.

40:20.918 --> 40:23.129
I don't want to see
any more badly composed tattoos.

40:23.212 --> 40:25.965
It's gnarly and it's not fair

40:26.048 --> 40:27.341
to the people
that have to wear them.

40:27.424 --> 40:30.177
Ugly tattoos have no place
in this building anymore.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.011
[bleep] go home.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.055
Head back to the loft.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.894
<i>If I wouldn't have had</i>
<i>these medical issues,</i>

40:38.978 --> 40:41.689
I know I would have had put more
of my heart into every tattoo.

40:41.772 --> 40:43.816
<i>Being sick</i>
<i>and going through all this,</i>

40:43.899 --> 40:45.609
it just seems like
everything's against me.

40:45.693 --> 40:49.321
At one time, money
was almost everything to me,

40:49.405 --> 40:50.823
<i>but now I have kids to live for.</i>

40:50.906 --> 40:54.326
Being there for them is more
important to me than anything.

40:57.329 --> 40:59.206
{\an8}[narrator] <i> On the next episode</i>
