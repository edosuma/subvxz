WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:05.125
Oh, oh, whoa-ho-ho.
Whoa, whoa.

00:05.208 --> 00:07.875
Six of the finest cows in Italy
died for this leather.

00:07.959 --> 00:09.583
I will not let
a child's car seat

00:09.667 --> 00:11.166
make a mockery
of their sacrifice.

00:11.250 --> 00:13.041
Ravi, put her
in the front seat.

00:13.125 --> 00:15.417
What are you doing?
Babies can't ride in the front.

00:15.500 --> 00:16.959
Yeah, get a clue,
Grandpa.

00:17.041 --> 00:18.875
I told you,
I don't go by "Grandpa."

00:18.959 --> 00:20.834
Well, you told us what
the other options are,

00:20.917 --> 00:22.834
and "Uncle Happy" and
"The Candyman" sound worse.

00:22.917 --> 00:23.917
RAVI: You're
Grandpa now,

00:24.000 --> 00:25.333
and that's forever.

00:25.417 --> 00:27.542
All right... come on, Edie,

00:27.625 --> 00:28.875
let's ditch these buzzkills.

00:28.959 --> 00:30.208
Put her in shotgun.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.375
I refuse to live
in a world

00:32.458 --> 00:34.667
where laws protect human life
over fine Italian leather.

00:34.750 --> 00:35.875
Ready, kid?

00:35.959 --> 00:38.875
(catchy instrumental
rock music playing)

00:38.959 --> 00:41.250
♪ ♪

00:45.959 --> 00:48.291
(engine revving)

00:49.959 --> 00:51.208
Sir, I can't
emphasize enough

00:51.291 --> 00:53.250
how little I care about
the six Italian cows

00:53.333 --> 00:54.917
that died
for your car's interior.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.083
Could you at least put a note
on the ticket

00:57.166 --> 00:59.542
that said we looked really cool
when you pulled us over?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.750
Did you bring a car seat
with you?

01:07.792 --> 01:08.917
JIMMY:
Hey, we're home!

01:09.000 --> 01:10.792
Oh, only a
half hour late.

01:10.875 --> 01:12.917
Did you cut your
Pilates short?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.458
No. Like Dario would
ever let me leave early.

01:15.542 --> 01:17.917
Oh, what the...? Ugh.
You know you need

01:18.000 --> 01:19.542
to change her diapers
sometimes, right?

01:19.625 --> 01:21.166
She still wears diapers?

01:21.250 --> 01:23.041
She didn't mention it to<i> me. </i>

01:23.125 --> 01:25.125
Oh.<i> Oh. </i>

01:25.208 --> 01:26.083
Hey, champ.

01:26.166 --> 01:28.083
Hey, Candyman. I need your help.

01:28.166 --> 01:28.959
What's up?

01:29.041 --> 01:30.333
We're parked in.

01:30.417 --> 01:32.125
Move the frickin' car, bro!

01:32.208 --> 01:34.500
It's not my car.
I'm just walking by.

01:34.583 --> 01:37.125
I didn't say it's your car.
Figure it out.

01:37.208 --> 01:38.834
Dad, I need you to take Edie

01:38.917 --> 01:41.000
to the Van Amburg Academy
Preschool open house.

01:41.083 --> 01:43.417
Uh, technically,
my Edie shift is over.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.500
I was just ready to clock out.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.417
By the way,
what kind of preschool

01:47.500 --> 01:48.959
has an open house, anyway?

01:49.041 --> 01:50.417
An awesome one.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.291
Look, Van Amburg Academy
has a robotics program,

01:52.375 --> 01:53.583
a ballet program,

01:53.667 --> 01:54.959
a-a meteorology center.

01:55.041 --> 01:56.959
Oh, no, that place
is so elitist.

01:57.041 --> 01:59.834
I think Edie would be better off
at Gerald's old preschool.

01:59.917 --> 02:01.291
Is that my mom? Mom,

02:01.375 --> 02:02.959
I don't want her going
to a preschool

02:03.041 --> 02:04.709
in a Russian lady's backyard.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.333
You<i> loved </i>the Russian lady.

02:06.417 --> 02:09.208
She sent you home every day
with a cup of soup.

02:09.291 --> 02:12.083
<i>Okroshka! </i>All there was
to eat was<i> okroshka. </i>

02:12.166 --> 02:15.208
Van Amburg Academy is, like,
the number one preschool in L.A.

02:15.291 --> 02:17.291
Yeah, according
to some awful book

02:17.375 --> 02:19.291
that profits
off of yuppie parents

02:19.375 --> 02:21.458
who view everything
as a competition.

02:21.542 --> 02:24.208
There's a book that says it's
number one? Where is it?

02:24.291 --> 02:26.959
It's...

02:27.041 --> 02:29.208
as a guy who owns the number one
restaurant in L.A.,

02:29.291 --> 02:30.667
certainly
I want my granddaughter

02:30.750 --> 02:32.542
going to the number one
preschool in L.A.

02:32.625 --> 02:33.875
I thought you
were number 24.

02:33.959 --> 02:35.208
Oh, you can't trust those lists.

02:35.291 --> 02:36.333
All right, Gerald,

02:36.417 --> 02:38.000
I'll take Edie.

02:38.083 --> 02:40.875
Ah, thank you! Um, um,
we'll try to meet you there.

02:40.959 --> 02:42.959
I think Vanessa's handling
the car problem.

02:43.041 --> 02:45.000
A little help?

02:45.083 --> 02:46.625
(quiet grunt)

02:46.709 --> 02:48.250
Suck it in, pork chop,
suck it in.

02:48.333 --> 02:50.250
You got to lay off
those breakfast burritos.

02:50.333 --> 02:51.709
(grunting)

02:51.792 --> 02:53.125
(laughs)
Here, allow me.

02:53.208 --> 02:54.041
(click)

02:54.125 --> 02:56.000
Ah. Oh, thank you,

02:56.083 --> 02:57.166
attractive stranger.

02:57.250 --> 02:59.667
Congratulations--
you win a baby!

02:59.750 --> 03:01.583
Oh, I hope was hoping
to win of those today.

03:01.667 --> 03:02.667
No, I'm just kidding.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.041
You know, for a second there,

03:04.125 --> 03:06.041
I thought you were the
same guy I saw earlier

03:06.125 --> 03:07.667
driving with a little
kid in the front seat.

03:07.750 --> 03:11.250
I would never do that.
That's, like, a... $265 ticket.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.583
No, I know, I know.
I tried to stop him,

03:13.667 --> 03:15.625
but he was blasting Taylor
Swift and couldn't hear me.

03:15.709 --> 03:18.166
Oh, I'm sure he was
probably just blasting it
for the child's sake.

03:18.250 --> 03:19.792
Oh, no, no.
She was crying.

03:19.875 --> 03:21.125
He was... lovin' it.

03:21.208 --> 03:22.375
Oh. (chuckles)

03:22.458 --> 03:24.000
a law-abiding father
like you are.

03:24.083 --> 03:26.041
Oh. I'm not her father.
Actually, I'm her...

03:26.125 --> 03:27.417
father.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.083
Isn't that what
I just said?

03:29.166 --> 03:31.375
No. No, you didn't say that.
Hi. I'm Jimmy.

03:31.458 --> 03:32.417
This is Edie.

03:32.500 --> 03:33.375
Aw.

03:33.458 --> 03:35.041
Hi, Edie. I'm Sloan.

03:35.125 --> 03:36.500
Are you guys visiting
the school?

03:36.583 --> 03:38.083
Uh-huh.

03:38.166 --> 03:39.917
Oh.

03:40.000 --> 03:40.917
Here. Follow me.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.166
'Kay.

03:43.792 --> 03:45.792
E-Edie.

03:45.875 --> 03:47.083
My daughter.

03:47.166 --> 03:48.375
Hey, come to Daddy.

03:48.458 --> 03:50.083
Mm, our campus is wonderful.

03:50.166 --> 03:52.792
But what really sets us apart
is our founder,

03:52.875 --> 03:54.875
Dr. Charles Van Amburg,
and his revolutionary

03:54.959 --> 03:57.208
Pathways of the Mind
curriculum.

03:57.291 --> 03:59.250
That's what
makes us the best.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.750
who only wants the best,
I like what I'm hearing.

04:01.834 --> 04:03.458
Congratulations.
We're in.

04:03.542 --> 04:05.083
Oh. Uh...
(chuckles)

04:05.166 --> 04:08.083
I'm sorry, that's not
really how it works, so...

04:08.166 --> 04:09.375
We get over

04:09.458 --> 04:12.125
a thousand applicants
every year for 20 spots.

04:12.208 --> 04:15.125
I didn't even know there<i> were </i>
a thousand two-year-olds. Yuck.

04:15.208 --> 04:16.750
Yeah. I don't mean
to sound discouraging,

04:16.834 --> 04:18.834
but your chances of getting in
are very slim.

04:18.917 --> 04:20.000
Eh.

04:20.083 --> 04:22.125
But enjoy the campus.

04:22.208 --> 04:25.000
Come on, Edie, let's check out
a school you'll never get into,

04:25.083 --> 04:26.917
and then after,
I'll take you to a store

04:27.000 --> 04:28.625
and burn a doll in front of you.

04:32.250 --> 04:34.125
I could fit.

04:34.208 --> 04:35.792
All right, go. Go, go.

04:36.834 --> 04:39.208
(low, indistinct chatter)

04:39.291 --> 04:41.125
Hi.

04:41.208 --> 04:44.125
Uh, I'm Gerald Kingsley,
Edie's dad. Sorry I'm late.

04:44.208 --> 04:46.375
Edie's dad?
I thought Jimmy was Edi...

04:46.458 --> 04:48.542
Oh. Duh.

04:48.625 --> 04:49.625
(both laugh)

04:49.709 --> 04:51.125
Uh, come on, follow me.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.375
I'll show you
where she is.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.250
Oh.

04:53.333 --> 04:55.333
Edie, look what I made.

04:55.417 --> 04:56.583
Ooh.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.458
Oh, yours is good, too.

04:58.542 --> 05:00.333
Yeah. Let me see
what you made.

05:00.417 --> 05:02.208
Oh, that's nice!

05:02.291 --> 05:04.208
You know, you can't be
the cutest girl in the world

05:04.291 --> 05:06.417
<i>and </i>the smartest-- you got to
spread it around a little bit.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.959
You don't want haters, right?

05:08.041 --> 05:09.750
(shouts indistinctly)

05:09.834 --> 05:11.166
Edie?

05:12.041 --> 05:13.166
Your other dad is here.

05:13.250 --> 05:14.375
GERALD:
Oh, my goodness!

05:15.333 --> 05:16.875
(laughs)

05:16.959 --> 05:18.500
"Other dad"?

05:18.583 --> 05:20.542
(singsongy):
Hey...

05:24.291 --> 05:25.709
Ah.

05:25.792 --> 05:28.625
You guys are such
an adorable couple.

05:28.709 --> 05:31.333
I'll be right back.

05:31.417 --> 05:34.208
Bye, now!

05:34.291 --> 05:36.208
Don't know.
Also don't care.
Should we go?

05:36.291 --> 05:38.250
Uh, let me just...
let me just guess.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.875
Yeah. You couldn't admit
that you're a grandpa,

05:40.959 --> 05:43.208
so you told her
that you're Edie's dad,

05:43.291 --> 05:45.875
and so that when I told her
I was also Edie's dad,

05:45.959 --> 05:47.208
instead of assuming
you were lying--

05:47.291 --> 05:49.375
'cause that would be
a crazy lie--

05:49.458 --> 05:52.250
she thinks that we're
Edie's two gay dads?

05:52.333 --> 05:54.208
(scoffs)
Yes.

05:54.291 --> 05:56.208
How did you mess this up
so quickly,

05:56.291 --> 05:58.333
so badly and so creepily?

05:58.417 --> 06:02.208
News flash: it's 2015-- being
gay is not creepy, it's cool.

06:02.291 --> 06:05.458
Being... gay with your dad
is creepy. Hi, kids.

06:05.542 --> 06:07.208
Well, look, if it makes
you feel any better,

06:07.291 --> 06:08.625
Sloan said that Edie
has no chance

06:08.709 --> 06:10.166
of getting in here.

06:10.250 --> 06:11.959
Hi... Sloan. Listen,

06:12.041 --> 06:13.208
I should've been
honest with you...

06:13.291 --> 06:14.542
Ah-ah, don't be silly.

06:14.625 --> 06:17.500
Van Amburg Academy
is very progressive.

06:17.583 --> 06:18.875
And we value
diversity.

06:18.959 --> 06:20.375
I'm not supposed
to tell you this,

06:20.458 --> 06:23.000
but we are always looking
for families like yours.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.250
We think you guys are<i> fabulous! </i>
(laughs)

06:25.333 --> 06:27.792
Oh, we-we love the
word "fabulous."

06:27.875 --> 06:29.208
Don't we?

06:29.291 --> 06:30.458
Fabulous.

06:30.542 --> 06:31.917
I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna

06:32.000 --> 06:33.041
set up an in-home interview,

06:33.125 --> 06:35.458
and I will have
Dr. Van Amburg

06:35.542 --> 06:37.000
do it himself.

06:37.083 --> 06:38.125
He's gonna love
you guys!

06:38.208 --> 06:39.709
(exhales)

06:40.917 --> 06:42.250
This campus rules!

06:42.333 --> 06:44.917
I changed my mind--
I want to be buried here

06:45.000 --> 06:46.959
instead of at Staples Center.

06:49.750 --> 06:51.750
Jimmy, what did you do?

06:56.375 --> 06:58.583
You're not really
doing this, are you?

06:58.667 --> 07:00.959
Trying to benefit from the gay
struggle without the struggle?

07:01.041 --> 07:03.333
Or the gay?

07:03.417 --> 07:05.625
I was living my life, quietly
dating Anna Kournikova's cousin,

07:05.709 --> 07:07.750
and all of a sudden,
my son shows up,

07:07.834 --> 07:09.291
and we're supposed to be lovers.

07:09.375 --> 07:10.375
GERALD:
Man, this is crazy.

07:10.458 --> 07:11.959
Let's just cancel
the interview.

07:12.041 --> 07:13.375
Yeah?
What?!

07:13.458 --> 07:15.834
No way, dummies.
We are not canceling!

07:15.917 --> 07:17.959
A good preschool
is the difference

07:18.041 --> 07:19.625
between Edie
becoming president,

07:19.709 --> 07:22.166
or becoming a spring break
shot girl in Lake Havasu.

07:22.250 --> 07:23.583
And I've seen Edie dance.

07:23.667 --> 07:25.166
She's got some
Havasu in her.

07:25.250 --> 07:26.208
It's terrifying.

07:26.291 --> 07:27.458
Uh, we'd have to do

07:27.542 --> 07:29.208
the home interview
with the headmaster.

07:29.291 --> 07:31.041
He's never gonna believe
we're a couple.

07:31.125 --> 07:32.959
I have no idea what it's like to
be in a homosexual relationship.

07:33.041 --> 07:34.792
It's like being
in any other relationship.

07:34.875 --> 07:36.291
I have no idea
what that's like, either.

07:36.375 --> 07:37.417
GERALD:
And even if Edie gets in,

07:37.500 --> 07:38.750
what, are we supposed

07:38.834 --> 07:40.125
to keep up
this lie forever?

07:40.208 --> 07:41.709
You can get through
one interview.

07:41.792 --> 07:44.291
After she's accepted,
just say you dumped Jimmy.

07:44.375 --> 07:46.375
Or Jimmy dumped him.

07:46.458 --> 07:47.625
Right. I mean...

07:47.709 --> 07:49.583
It's really not that crazy.

07:49.667 --> 07:51.959
Yes, it is.
Lying like this is crazy.

07:52.041 --> 07:53.917
Everyone lies on applications.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.375
You know, maybe you two
are just homophobic.

07:56.458 --> 07:58.375
Uh...
What?!

07:58.458 --> 08:01.333
Vanessa, that makes me angry
to hear you say that.

08:01.417 --> 08:03.083
Annelise, tell her
how happy I was

08:03.166 --> 08:05.291
when-when same sex marriage got
legalized. Tell her, tell her.

08:05.375 --> 08:07.208
Oh, it's true, like many
straight people these days,

08:07.291 --> 08:09.792
you made a very big show
of how excited you were.

08:09.875 --> 08:11.959
Full-on tears of joy.

08:12.041 --> 08:14.083
Okay, then. Great.

08:14.166 --> 08:16.333
Let's do what's best for Edie,
and let's have the interview.

08:16.417 --> 08:18.083
(Gerald sighs heavily)

08:18.166 --> 08:20.166
I always said
I'd do anything for Edie.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.500
But from now on,
maybe I'll stop saying that.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.959
Look at all these fun projects

08:26.041 --> 08:28.125
from your old preschool.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.542
Yeah.
Here.

08:29.625 --> 08:31.500
Oh, this is a snowman
or a house.

08:31.583 --> 08:33.125
Oh!

08:33.208 --> 08:34.834
Edie would
love it there.

08:34.917 --> 08:39.000
And bonus: you don't have to
pretend you sleep with your dad.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.333
Mom, you know, you always say
how great my preschool was,

08:41.417 --> 08:43.000
but I do live
in your guest house.

08:43.083 --> 08:45.250
You know, if I'd gone to
Van Amburg Academy, who knows?

08:45.333 --> 08:48.417
Maybe I'd be living
in Elon Musk's guest house.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.875
Oh, poor Gerald.
You had it so rough.

08:50.959 --> 08:53.417
I'm not saying you made a
mistake sending me there.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.041
I'm not saying that, either.
Is that what you're saying?

08:56.125 --> 08:58.291
What are you saying?

08:58.375 --> 09:00.333
I got to go.

09:00.417 --> 09:02.458
We're setting up for
the interview at Dad's place.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.834
My boyfriend's place, my...

09:04.917 --> 09:06.542
You two deserve each other.

09:06.625 --> 09:08.250
(door closes)

09:08.333 --> 09:09.875
Do you think I was a bad mom?

09:09.959 --> 09:11.458
Ball.

09:11.542 --> 09:14.250
No. That was a "no."
I heard that.

09:14.333 --> 09:17.166
(gasps)
Ah.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.083
Oh.

09:19.166 --> 09:20.458
Okay, for the
interview tomorrow,

09:20.542 --> 09:22.834
we need to make
your condo look more

09:22.917 --> 09:25.875
convincing.

09:25.959 --> 09:28.500
I saw this thing where a gay guy
was living on a boat.

09:28.583 --> 09:30.041
I'm actually more worried
about them believing

09:30.125 --> 09:31.500
that a family lives here.

09:31.583 --> 09:33.250
Which is why

09:33.333 --> 09:35.709
I had Annelise make up some
fake old photos of us. Here.

09:37.542 --> 09:39.166
Wow. Annelise, you're an artist!

09:39.250 --> 09:41.250
This looks so real.

09:41.333 --> 09:42.750
Check it out.
We're at the Capitol Building.

09:42.834 --> 09:44.709
We're dog-sledding in Alaska.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.500
We're celebrating the launch

09:46.583 --> 09:48.875
of the Hubble Telescope.
We work at NASA?

09:48.959 --> 09:51.375
Oh, that's what's ridiculous
about this situation?

09:57.583 --> 10:00.291
All right, so,
we have pictures of us.

10:00.375 --> 10:02.208
We are... done.

10:02.291 --> 10:03.792
One more thing.

10:03.875 --> 10:07.458
We need to make it look like
a baby actually lives here.

How about, uh...
(clears throat) gay club?

10:38.125 --> 10:39.542
That's where you want to say
we went on our first date?

10:39.625 --> 10:41.333
Mm-hmm.
A gay club?
Yeah.

10:41.417 --> 10:42.625
What's wrong with a gay club?
What's wrong

10:42.709 --> 10:44.542
with having a place
to feel safe and have fun?

10:44.625 --> 10:46.792
It's just a little on
the nose, don't you think?

10:46.875 --> 10:48.333
I mean, I mean, you know,

10:48.417 --> 10:49.959
we could go anywhere
you normally go.

10:50.041 --> 10:53.083
If I were a girl, where would
you take me on a first date?

10:53.166 --> 10:54.542
If you were a girl,
I wouldn't take you

10:54.625 --> 10:57.208
on a date,
because we're gay, see?

10:57.291 --> 10:59.417
Yeah, I got to get to work.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.083
We can't have one
nice night together.

11:01.166 --> 11:03.083
It's just work, work,
work, work with you.

11:03.166 --> 11:04.625
Maybe if someone had
a little discipline

11:04.709 --> 11:06.125
with the credit cards.

11:06.208 --> 11:09.041
(laughter)

11:09.125 --> 11:12.458
Weird, right?

11:12.542 --> 11:15.166
Kids leaving stuff everywhere.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.458
I can't wait for this interview
to be over so I can get

11:17.542 --> 11:19.083
my apartment back to normal.

11:19.166 --> 11:21.583
I mean, it might make sense
for you to leave this stuff up.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.583
Edie's gonna be over here a
lot, and got a family now.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.166
You should have
a family house.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.583
Face it, Grandpa,

11:27.667 --> 11:29.583
you're gonna be
a grandpa forever.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.333
Ladies.

11:43.417 --> 11:45.583
Did anyone check their IDs
before they served them alcohol?

11:45.667 --> 11:47.250
They look a little underage.

11:47.333 --> 11:50.500
(laughter)

11:51.709 --> 11:53.625
Hey.

11:53.709 --> 11:56.750
Mm.

11:56.834 --> 11:58.625
But don't worry.
I already told her

11:58.709 --> 12:01.625
you're in a monogamous
relationship with your son.

12:01.709 --> 12:03.667
(laughter)

12:03.750 --> 12:05.625
(laughter)
Perfect.

12:05.709 --> 12:07.208
Hi.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.875
Sloan. Uh, what
are you doing here?

12:09.959 --> 12:11.959
Well, I was just having
dinner down the road, and

12:12.041 --> 12:14.250
I remembered that you said you
had a restaurant around here.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.625
Stopped by to make sure
you weren't lying. (laughs)

12:16.709 --> 12:18.875
(laughing)
(sighs)

12:18.959 --> 12:21.583
(laughing)
How about a drink?

12:21.667 --> 12:22.750
You want a...?
I'm gonna have a drink.

12:22.834 --> 12:24.583
You want a drink?
Sure.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.500
Thanks.
Seriously,

12:26.583 --> 12:28.625
why are all
the hottest guys gay?!

12:28.709 --> 12:30.083
We're not all gay. No.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.542
Yes, you are,
and you know it.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.041
Gerald's not so bad, either.

12:33.125 --> 12:34.542
Yeah, no, he's-he's definitely

12:34.625 --> 12:36.041
the second hottest guy
in our relationship.

12:36.125 --> 12:38.250
Okay, I don't know about that.
He is the younger one,

12:38.333 --> 12:40.625
you dog, you.

12:40.709 --> 12:42.667
You might be old enough
to be his father.

12:42.750 --> 12:44.625
Yeah, but I'm-I'm not
his father, though.

12:44.709 --> 12:46.667
Yeah, I know.

12:46.750 --> 12:48.834
(laughter)

12:48.917 --> 12:50.667
Okay, so tell me
how you guys met.

12:50.750 --> 12:52.208
Oh, you'll never guess.

12:52.291 --> 12:54.667
Playing sports.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.667
And then came Edie.

12:56.750 --> 13:00.291
Mm.

13:00.375 --> 13:02.542
Nope, nope,
my old life was gone.

13:02.625 --> 13:04.667
Just poof.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.333
But you're the happiest
you've ever been.

13:06.417 --> 13:08.417
My bachelor pad
is baby-proofed.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.667
There's crumbs and
stickers everywhere.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.959
Basically clocked in
all the time now.

13:13.041 --> 13:15.917
I mean, every day
is family day.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.709
It's just... oh.

13:18.792 --> 13:22.709
It is so refreshing
to see how committed you are.

13:22.792 --> 13:24.709
I mean, seriously,
most guys I know

13:24.792 --> 13:27.417
would be just terrified
to get rid of their old life.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.709
You know, they're just
desperately holding on

13:29.792 --> 13:32.250
to their so-called manhood
in some way. It's just...

13:39.333 --> 13:41.291
I'm a terrible boyfriend.

13:44.959 --> 13:46.792
All right, Edie, I really hope
you don't understand

13:46.875 --> 13:49.291
what's happening,
but it's all for you.

13:49.375 --> 13:52.041
You okay?
You look a little nervous.

13:52.125 --> 13:54.333
Ha. No. The only thing I'm
nervous about is what...

13:54.417 --> 13:56.291
Ivy League college
Edie's gonna get into.

13:56.375 --> 13:59.041
I see her as a, uh...
as a Cromwell girl.

13:59.125 --> 14:00.750
No, I see her going
to more of a real university

14:00.834 --> 14:02.083
that you didn't
just make up.

14:02.166 --> 14:03.333
(buzzer sounding)

14:03.417 --> 14:05.250
they're here.
Vanessa, you want

14:05.333 --> 14:06.500
to get the door?

14:06.583 --> 14:08.083
don't you dare screw this up,

14:08.166 --> 14:09.250
okay?
Be cool.

14:09.333 --> 14:11.333
We got this.

14:11.750 --> 14:12.875
(whispering):
The baby. Get the baby.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.834
Hello!

14:17.917 --> 14:20.250
I'm Barbara.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.250
I have a black belt in karate
and...

14:22.333 --> 14:24.417
Uh, Barbara's
our babysitter.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.250
Uh, that'll be all
for now, Barbara.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.250
Yes, thank you,
Barbara.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.583
I'm Charles Van Amburg.
You must be Jimmy and Gerald.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.792
Yes.

14:32.875 --> 14:34.750
Edie.

14:34.834 --> 14:36.583
Which would make me Barbara.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.875
And that's Annelise,
our-our...

14:38.959 --> 14:42.000
wacky neighbor, who comes over
uninvited and eats all our food.

14:42.083 --> 14:43.709
I'm their Kramer.

14:43.792 --> 14:45.291
Uh, come on
in.

14:45.375 --> 14:47.125
Um, I'm sorry the place
is such a mess.

14:47.208 --> 14:49.291
Someone over here
is a real slob.

14:49.375 --> 14:50.750
Uh, let me give you
the tour, yes?

14:50.834 --> 14:51.792
Thank you.

14:51.875 --> 14:53.875
SLOAN:
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

14:53.959 --> 14:56.125
Hi. Sorry. I'm late.

14:56.208 --> 14:57.959
Sloan. I didn't know
you were coming.

14:58.041 --> 15:00.542
Well, here I am. You know,
you ran out of the restaurant

15:00.625 --> 15:02.542
so fast, we didn't get a chance
to talk about what happened.

15:02.625 --> 15:04.291
Oh, you mean
that silly little kiss?

15:04.375 --> 15:06.500
That was nothing.
I kiss everyone.

15:06.583 --> 15:08.000
I'm ridiculous.

15:08.083 --> 15:09.291
Are you two even gay?

15:09.375 --> 15:11.959
That was not
the kiss of a gay man.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.750
Uh, Ger? Ger.

15:14.834 --> 15:16.750
(quietly):
Kiss me.

15:16.834 --> 15:21.333
Kiss me. Kiss me.

15:21.417 --> 15:24.834
Dr. Van Amburg, would you like
to see a picture of Ger and I

15:24.917 --> 15:28.917
when we were...
working at NASA?

15:30.417 --> 15:33.333
(children laughing)

15:33.417 --> 15:36.375
SARA:
<i>And now my son</i>

15:36.458 --> 15:39.333
wants Edie to go to
this pretentious private school,

15:39.417 --> 15:43.208
and I just remember how this was
such a special place for Gerald.

15:43.291 --> 15:44.333
(gasps)

15:44.417 --> 15:45.583
♪ ♪

15:45.667 --> 15:47.417

15:50.417 --> 15:52.709
(sizzling)

15:52.792 --> 15:55.625
Tsiliana, you've...
made quite a few changes.

15:55.709 --> 15:58.333
No. School exactly the same.

15:58.417 --> 16:02.667
Same toys, same playground,
same stove.

16:02.750 --> 16:08.041
Nyet. We even
have same magic box.

16:08.125 --> 16:10.458
Oh, my God, that's an
abandoned refrigerator.

16:10.542 --> 16:12.375
Not according
to child imagination.

16:12.458 --> 16:15.500
It can be jail, time machine,
other kind of jail.

16:15.583 --> 16:19.500
No. No, that definitely
was not here before.

16:19.583 --> 16:22.125
There's no way I would have
left Gerald in a playground

16:22.208 --> 16:23.667
with an abandoned refrigerator.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.625
You were single mother,<i> da? </i>

16:25.709 --> 16:28.166
Yes. What does that have
to do with anything?

16:28.250 --> 16:29.542
Single mothers tough.

16:29.625 --> 16:31.375
They do the best they can.

16:31.458 --> 16:35.458
They don't worry about
abandoned fridge in playground.

16:35.542 --> 16:39.375
But now you older,
you have more money, more time.

16:39.458 --> 16:41.208
Now you worry.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.458
Now you soft.

16:43.542 --> 16:46.041
(grunts)

16:47.333 --> 16:48.917
(gasps)

16:51.166 --> 16:53.083
Oh, my God.

16:53.166 --> 16:55.583
I want Edie to go
to Van Amburg Academy.

16:55.667 --> 16:58.375
Ooh, Van Amburg
Academy.

16:58.458 --> 16:59.709
That's where my kids go.

17:04.083 --> 17:06.250
So, Dr. Van Amburg,
as Edie's babysitter, Barbara,

17:06.333 --> 17:07.917
I would love to hear more
about the school's curriculum.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.333
Do you have karate?

17:10.417 --> 17:12.625
We tailor each child's
curriculum to meet

17:12.709 --> 17:15.041
their individual cognitive
and emotional needs.

17:15.125 --> 17:17.000
But what really makes
our school special

17:17.083 --> 17:18.792
are the families,
which is why

17:18.875 --> 17:20.458
we're so thorough
in our selection process.

17:20.542 --> 17:22.375
So, how long have you two
been together?

17:22.458 --> 17:23.709
BOTH:
Four years.

17:23.792 --> 17:24.709
What's your anniversary?

17:24.792 --> 17:25.959
BOTH:
September 29.

17:26.041 --> 17:27.041
Where was
your first date?

17:27.125 --> 17:29.834
BOTH: The train museum
at Griffith Park.

17:29.917 --> 17:31.750
Sloan,

17:31.834 --> 17:33.542
why all the questions?

17:33.625 --> 17:35.875
I just, uh... (chuckles)
I think it's important

17:35.959 --> 17:37.542
that we know as much as we can
about our families.

17:37.625 --> 17:39.458
Well, as you can see,
we're very open.

17:39.542 --> 17:41.291
Yes. Clearly.

17:41.375 --> 17:42.750
Hi!

17:42.834 --> 17:44.083
(door shuts)

17:44.166 --> 17:45.875
I'm Sara. I'm Gerald's mom

17:45.959 --> 17:47.917
and Edie's grandmother.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.500
Hello, Sara.

17:49.583 --> 17:51.500
We can't tell you
how excited we are

17:51.583 --> 17:54.166
about Edie attending
Van Amburg Academy.

17:54.250 --> 17:55.834
It's always been a dream
of mine.

17:55.917 --> 17:57.583
SLOAN:
Well, it is lovely
to meet another member

17:57.667 --> 18:00.917
of the family. Where was Gerald
and Jimmy's first date?

18:03.625 --> 18:05.709
(chugging, toot sounds)

18:10.166 --> 18:12.583
It was so nice to meet you.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.500
I... What? Yes!

18:14.583 --> 18:16.792
(chuckles)
I...

18:16.875 --> 18:19.959
(chuckles)
have to go there.

18:20.041 --> 18:21.333
(chuckles)
She's a little...

18:21.417 --> 18:23.875
mmm. We take care of her.

18:23.959 --> 18:27.875
That's sweet. Well, it's been a
pleasure chatting with you all.

18:27.959 --> 18:30.083
You seem like a lovely family.
I can see how you would be

18:30.166 --> 18:32.792
wonderful additions to
our school community.

18:32.875 --> 18:33.709
Thank you.

18:33.792 --> 18:34.792
Jimmy kissed me!

18:34.875 --> 18:36.500
What?
What?
What?

18:36.583 --> 18:38.625
(quietly):
This is the best.

18:38.709 --> 18:39.875
You kissed her?

18:39.959 --> 18:41.291
It was just a kiss.

18:41.375 --> 18:42.875
Y-You know how
us gay guys are.

18:42.959 --> 18:45.333
We're either playing
sports or kissing girls.

18:45.417 --> 18:48.542
How could you do that, Dad?

18:48.625 --> 18:51.083
Are you two
father and son?

18:51.166 --> 18:53.083
No.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.917
Right?
(chuckles)

18:56.000 --> 18:59.083
I don't know what's going on
here, but it doesn't seem good.

18:59.166 --> 19:00.917
I think this interview is over.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.667
Wait.

19:02.750 --> 19:06.291
Look at... us. I mean,
we're... mmm. See?

19:06.375 --> 19:07.417
What is wrong with you?

19:07.500 --> 19:08.875
Pretending
to be a couple

19:08.959 --> 19:09.917
so that your daughter
gets preferential treatment

19:10.000 --> 19:11.417
is...

19:11.500 --> 19:13.709
the kind of moxie Van Amburg
Academy is looking for?

19:13.792 --> 19:15.500
...vile and offensive.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.667
I knew it was either "moxie"
or "vile and offensive."

19:20.750 --> 19:24.250
You two royally
screwed that up, right?

19:24.333 --> 19:26.000
Right?

19:27.792 --> 19:29.917
I'm sorry, guys.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.583
I guess
I really screwed up.

19:31.667 --> 19:33.875
Looks like I'll be sleeping
on the stained couch tonight.

19:33.959 --> 19:36.875
It's okay. You know, we tried
something really stupid,

19:36.959 --> 19:38.583
and it didn't
work out, but...

19:38.667 --> 19:41.166
now we have a story we can tell
for the rest of our lives.

19:41.250 --> 19:43.083
Yeah, I'll say.

19:43.166 --> 19:44.959
like these. And, Mom, look,

19:45.041 --> 19:46.750
if the Russian lady's
preschool was good enough

19:46.834 --> 19:48.875
for me,
I'm sure...

19:48.959 --> 19:50.083
Oh.

19:50.166 --> 19:51.959
Well, then we bow our heads
and say...

19:52.041 --> 19:54.417
(speaking Russian)

19:57.125 --> 20:00.250
So, what's the next preschool
we should try?

20:00.333 --> 20:02.041
Oh, well, see...
(clears throat)

20:02.125 --> 20:04.709
now, that depends on what kind.

20:04.792 --> 20:07.875
I marked up this whole book.
We have, uh,

20:07.959 --> 20:11.542
play-based, Montessori,
of course, Jewish Temple...

20:11.625 --> 20:13.834
What?

20:13.917 --> 20:14.792
What are you guys looking at?

20:14.875 --> 20:16.000
My glasses?

20:16.083 --> 20:18.166
Oh. I lost my good ones.

20:18.250 --> 20:22.375
You must really care about this.
You're reading a book.

20:27.875 --> 20:29.375
Oh, you can leave that one.

20:29.458 --> 20:32.709
Really? Like,
for other people to see?

20:32.792 --> 20:35.000
Yeah. You know,
an ex-boyfriend once told me

20:35.083 --> 20:37.000
that I should get used
to being a grandpa.

20:37.083 --> 20:39.083
The truth is,
I'm actually starting to...

20:39.166 --> 20:41.000
adapt to this whole situation.

20:41.083 --> 20:45.000
That's sweet. You called
your family a situation.

20:45.083 --> 20:48.000
Did you hear that, Edie?
We've been upgraded.

20:48.083 --> 20:50.041
We used to be an accident.
