WEBVTT

00:08.458 --> 00:09.709
This damn traffic.

00:09.792 --> 00:11.375
We're gonna be late
for the Bazooka Sharks game,

00:11.458 --> 00:12.750
and if you don't see
the beginning,

00:12.834 --> 00:14.500
the rest of the game
doesn't make any sense.

00:14.583 --> 00:15.792
Thanks for agreeing
to take me

00:15.875 --> 00:17.625
to Urban Outfitters
after the game.

00:17.709 --> 00:20.250
It sucks that the closest one
is 70 miles away.

00:20.333 --> 00:21.750
I never agreed to that.

00:21.834 --> 00:23.417
I don't even know what that is,
some sort of store?

00:23.500 --> 00:25.291
Stan,
it's not just a store.

00:25.375 --> 00:28.250
It's a lifestyle, but more
than that, it's a store.

00:28.333 --> 00:30.291
They have everything --
Polaroid cameras,

00:30.375 --> 00:32.875
suitcase record players,
and the flower dress

00:32.959 --> 00:35.250
Janeane Garofalo wore
in "Reality Bites."

00:35.333 --> 00:36.417
It's one-stop shopping

00:36.500 --> 00:37.917
if you're looking to go
full Garofalo.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.417
Fine. If it'll shut you up,
we can go there after the game.

00:40.500 --> 00:41.417
Thanks, Stan.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.458
Some road head
to celebrate?

00:44.542 --> 00:45.917
We haven't moved in ages.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.417
You know what our town
could use?

00:47.500 --> 00:48.917
One of those
bullet trains.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.250
A bullet train?

00:50.333 --> 00:52.458
Yeah,
a high-speed bullet train.

00:52.542 --> 00:54.375
Take you from downtown
to the Sharks' Nest

00:54.458 --> 00:55.583
at 200 miles per hour.

00:55.667 --> 00:58.083
That is a humdinger
of an idea.

00:58.166 --> 01:00.041
You got to take that
straight to the mayor.

01:00.125 --> 01:01.750
Okay, let's do it.

01:01.834 --> 01:03.834
I feel good about this --
really good.

01:03.917 --> 01:05.917
And not just because
I'm on OxyContin,

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
though that is

01:09.083 --> 01:12.333
Man: It's kickoff time,
Bazooka Shark Fans.

01:12.417 --> 01:13.750
We're missing the game.

01:13.834 --> 01:15.458

02:00.083 --> 02:02.500
No one even touched
their plates.

02:02.583 --> 02:06.208
Guess they're too good for this
lovely breakfast brisket.

02:06.291 --> 02:07.417
Aah!

02:09.250 --> 02:12.333
Oh, you like my brisket.

02:12.417 --> 02:14.375
Well, I like you.

02:14.458 --> 02:17.333
Oh, but you have to try it
with the sauce and sides.

02:17.417 --> 02:19.500
Here,
I'll make you a plate.

02:21.959 --> 02:23.417
This, Mom.

02:23.500 --> 02:26.875
This kind of thing is why
you're always getting rabies.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.083
Thanks for taking the time
out of your busy schedule

02:31.166 --> 02:33.083
to meet with us.
-My pleasure.

02:33.166 --> 02:35.875
I, uh, always have time
for my constituents.

02:35.959 --> 02:38.041
You really can lower
your firearm now.

02:38.125 --> 02:39.166
Of course.

02:39.250 --> 02:40.875
I just find
the old skull popper

02:40.959 --> 02:42.875
works better than
a bunch of phone calls.

02:42.959 --> 02:44.500
Now, I only have
a few minutes,

02:44.583 --> 02:47.583
and then I have to get back
to my reelection campaign.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.458
I hear you have
an amazing idea for me.

02:49.542 --> 02:53.458
Yes. Well, sorry.
I'm a little nervous.

02:53.542 --> 02:54.792
Stan, don't be nervous.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.959
He's the one who looks
like a human bullfrog.

02:59.083 --> 03:02.166
But he's also the one
we have to impress right now.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.041
And judging by the scowl
on his face,

03:04.125 --> 03:05.542
he heard
the bullfrog thing.

03:05.625 --> 03:07.625
So take it away, Stan.

03:07.709 --> 03:10.417
Mr. Mayor, this town
needs a bullet train.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.041
A bullet train. Huh.

03:13.125 --> 03:14.375
Guys?
-A conservative estimate

03:14.458 --> 03:15.875
for a bullet train
is in the billions,

03:15.959 --> 03:17.917
and using a bullet train
for intracity travel

03:18.000 --> 03:19.625
makes no sense at all.

03:21.709 --> 03:23.041
Let Stan finish.

03:23.125 --> 03:24.875
I think you'll change
your dumb minds

03:24.959 --> 03:26.166
after you hear
the presentation

03:26.250 --> 03:29.417
my main man worked
all afternoon on.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.458
Here's a rendering
of the train proposal

03:31.542 --> 03:32.834
along with
environmental impact,

03:32.875 --> 03:34.959
traffic-flow analysis,
and other factors.

03:35.041 --> 03:39.250
I drew Batman, too, because I'm
really good at drawing Batman.

03:42.917 --> 03:44.625
I humiliated myself.

03:44.709 --> 03:45.834
It's a stupid idea.

03:45.917 --> 03:46.834
No, it's not.

03:46.917 --> 03:48.417
I still believe
in the idea.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.041
I still believe
in you.

03:50.125 --> 03:51.709
Tell her your idea,
Stan.

03:51.792 --> 03:55.375
I think this town
should have a bullet train.

03:55.458 --> 03:57.417
A bullet train?

03:57.500 --> 03:58.709
Oh, hon.

03:58.792 --> 04:00.959
That is exactly
what this town needs.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.792
I hate that we don't
have one of those.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.375
You guys talking
bullet train?

04:04.458 --> 04:07.417
Yeah, I-I think it could help
with traffic and stuff.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.250
I, for one,
dislike traffic,

04:09.333 --> 04:11.417
so this idea is really
speaking to me.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.291
Well, it isn't
just about traffic.

04:13.375 --> 04:15.208
A bullet train
isn't about taking you

04:15.291 --> 04:16.291
from one place to another.

04:16.375 --> 04:18.417
A bullet train is about
telling people

04:18.500 --> 04:20.959
that this town has arrived.

04:21.041 --> 04:22.458
That's beautiful.

04:22.542 --> 04:24.125
You're beautiful, babe.

04:24.208 --> 04:25.291
Aww.

04:25.375 --> 04:27.250
I'm getting so horny
for this bullet train.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.083
Has anyone considered
roundabouts?

04:29.166 --> 04:32.500
In Europe, they've alleviated

04:32.583 --> 04:34.542
We're talking
about a train.

04:34.625 --> 04:37.125
Now, I'm not gonna stand up
here and say that this train

04:37.208 --> 04:38.917
will solve
all of your problems

04:39.000 --> 04:40.667
because you already
know it will.

04:40.750 --> 04:44.458
It's so simple, just two stops,
downtown to the Sharks' Nest.

04:44.542 --> 04:46.834
This woman right here,
she could get to the game fast.

04:46.917 --> 04:50.000
This guy here could also get
to the game very fast.

04:50.083 --> 04:52.542
Will the tracks run
through Clementine Park?

04:52.625 --> 04:53.875
I hate that place.

04:53.959 --> 04:56.000
It's full of couples
having sex in sleeping bags,

04:56.083 --> 05:00.000
and I am sick of watching
them as much as I can.

05:00.083 --> 05:01.583
I'm not sure.

05:01.667 --> 05:03.250
That is all
I need to hear.

05:03.333 --> 05:07.250
I am all aboard
this train idea.

05:07.333 --> 05:09.625
-Chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka...
-Whoo-whoo!

05:09.709 --> 05:11.750
-...chicka-chicka-chicka...
-Whoo-whoo!

05:11.834 --> 05:14.458
-...chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka.
-Whoo-whoo!

05:33.125 --> 05:36.083
I have half a mind
to ask who that was.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.834
-What do you think?
-What the hell is going on?

05:38.917 --> 05:41.333
I've never mentioned it
because I'm humble as hell,

05:41.417 --> 05:43.000
but as W. Willard Wartz,

05:43.083 --> 05:45.625
I ran Adlai Stevenson's
presidential bids

05:45.709 --> 05:47.291
in '52 and '56.

05:47.375 --> 05:50.709
Landslide losses,
laughed out of the beltway,

05:50.792 --> 05:52.417
swore off politics
forever.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.458
That is until I saw you
speak at that diner.

05:55.542 --> 05:58.583
Stan, you're a
once-in-a-generation candidate.

05:58.667 --> 06:00.083
You have to run
for mayor.

06:00.166 --> 06:01.417
Look at this new sign.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.750
Oops. Old sign.
But timeless message.

06:05.834 --> 06:07.583
Me? Run for mayor?

06:07.667 --> 06:09.959
Oh, my God, Stan.
That should be your slogan.

06:10.041 --> 06:12.750
"Stan Smith --
me run for mayor."

06:12.834 --> 06:14.667
Uh, I don't know, Roger.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.125
No, no, no. No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

06:17.208 --> 06:20.500
Steve, you cannot be seen with
those losers during an election.

06:20.583 --> 06:21.750
I got you new friends.

06:21.834 --> 06:22.917
New friends?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.583
If you think I'm going
to abandon...

06:25.667 --> 06:29.083
Make sure those dorks don't
sneak in through the back.

06:29.166 --> 06:31.834
To the pool!

06:31.917 --> 06:33.917
Let me guess, I'm going
to need a new husband

06:34.000 --> 06:35.667
because Jeff's gonna make
the campaign look bad.

06:35.750 --> 06:38.625
Jeff is actually polling great
with suburban househusbands

06:38.709 --> 06:41.083
and Cajun seniors
in the meat-packing industry.

06:41.166 --> 06:44.291
We have to win those demos,
or we are screwed.

06:44.375 --> 06:46.000
I'm a pollster now.

06:46.083 --> 06:49.583
And you said calling everyone
mon ami was super annoying.

06:49.667 --> 06:51.875
Are you sure a different
husband wouldn't poll better?

06:51.959 --> 06:53.291
You know, someone with
a big-ass dick

06:53.375 --> 06:54.917
the voters
can really get behind?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.959
Isn't this exciting,
Stan?

06:57.041 --> 06:59.333
I could be
the First Lady.

06:59.417 --> 07:00.792
I've always thought
of myself

07:00.875 --> 07:03.250
as the Jackie Kennedy
of Langley Falls.

07:03.333 --> 07:04.834
Um, what's with the...

07:04.917 --> 07:07.166
Lamonte?
He's my rat.

07:07.250 --> 07:09.375
Oh, hey, Lamonte.
So, what do you think, Stanny?

07:09.458 --> 07:10.959
I'm not sure, Roger.

07:11.041 --> 07:13.417
Isn't there more to governing
than just building a train?

07:13.500 --> 07:15.500
No, that's the genius
of your idea.

07:15.583 --> 07:17.083
The train solves
everything.

07:17.166 --> 07:18.375
Unemployment --

07:18.458 --> 07:20.041
everybody can have a job
building the train.

07:20.125 --> 07:22.959
Education -- ride the rails
and learn some hobo wisdom.

07:23.041 --> 07:26.750
Crime -- the only thing criminal
is not having a bullet train.

07:26.834 --> 07:29.166
Stan,
your town needs you.

07:29.250 --> 07:30.875
I'll do it.

07:30.959 --> 07:32.917
Stan Smith is running
for mayor.

07:35.083 --> 07:36.917
What do you think,
Francine?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.500
Ever done it
with a mayor?

07:38.583 --> 07:40.583
I have.
Six of them, actually.

07:40.667 --> 07:43.667
Seven if you count the guy
in the Mayor McCheese outfit.

07:43.750 --> 07:46.041
You dog.

07:52.083 --> 07:53.291
Dad, you remember
James Garfield,

07:53.375 --> 07:54.667
the dead ex-president
you cloned?

07:54.750 --> 07:57.500
Of course. Welcome aboard
Team Stan, Garfy.

07:57.583 --> 07:59.041
Happy to pitch in.

07:59.125 --> 08:01.583
I do know a thing or two
about politics.

08:01.667 --> 08:05.250
I've been a U.S. President,
and, also, thanks to Hulu,

08:05.333 --> 08:08.583
I've now seen every episode
of "Spin City."

08:08.667 --> 08:10.500
Come on, our campaign ad
is about to air.

08:10.583 --> 08:13.875
I hope you like it, because I
blew our entire budget on this.

08:13.959 --> 08:18.500
Leykis:
Everyone thinks they know
Mayor Alan Woodside.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.709
I got Tom Leykis to do
the voice over.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.875
Huge get.
Chicks love him.

08:23.917 --> 08:26.875
But how well
do we really know him?

08:26.959 --> 08:29.959
That's right.

08:30.041 --> 08:33.417
He's a giant spider,
except this spider hates God,

08:33.500 --> 08:36.875
young mothers,
and only loves one thing --

08:36.959 --> 08:39.208
masturbating
on the American flag.

08:39.291 --> 08:41.375
I'm Stan Smith,
and I approve this message.

08:41.458 --> 08:46.250
This is
a very savvy ad.

08:46.333 --> 08:47.625
Roger, I'm not sure --

08:47.709 --> 08:49.875
You got to trust me, Stan.
Just focus on the debates.

08:49.959 --> 08:52.083
We need to spend
all day tomorrow prepping

08:52.166 --> 08:53.500
because the debates
are Thursday.

08:53.583 --> 08:55.625
Isn't today Thursday?

08:56.875 --> 08:59.875
If you're right, and I'm
beginning to think you are,

08:59.959 --> 09:03.083
I slept 36 hours
last night.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.917
I'm Memphis Stormfront,
your local weatherman,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.291
and I guess I also do this.

09:09.375 --> 09:10.834
Let's welcome our candidates.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.083
Your incumbent mayor,
Alan Woodside.

09:13.166 --> 09:16.083
And you've probably seen
this guy in your Facebook feed,

09:16.166 --> 09:19.458
yelling about trains,
Stan Smith.

09:19.542 --> 09:20.917
This will be
a town-hall debate

09:21.000 --> 09:23.875
with questions from
real undecided voters.

09:23.959 --> 09:26.083
Let's begin.
-As a pregnant woman,

09:26.166 --> 09:28.959
I want to know why
Mayor Woodside thinks I'm ugly.

09:29.041 --> 09:31.500
What?!
I do not think you're ugly.

09:31.583 --> 09:33.458
I think motherhood is --
-Boring.

09:33.542 --> 09:36.458
This guy has derailed
the town long enough.

09:36.542 --> 09:39.667
We need to get back
on track.

09:39.750 --> 09:41.291
Hello.
I'm a small-business owner.

09:41.375 --> 09:44.667
Why is Mayor Woodside poisoning
the town's water supply?

09:44.750 --> 09:46.417
What?
I-I-I'm not doing that.

09:48.166 --> 09:50.000
Woodside molested my goat.

09:51.208 --> 09:53.834
I have never touched
that goat or any goat.

09:53.917 --> 09:56.542
I think we're focusing
on the wrong thing here.

09:56.625 --> 10:00.583
My opponent has no experience
governing at any level.

10:00.667 --> 10:05.750
What I may lack in experience,
I make up for in The Power Team.

10:05.834 --> 10:08.792
♪ We're not gonna take it ♪

10:08.875 --> 10:12.166
♪ No, we ain't gonna take it ♪

10:12.250 --> 10:17.750

10:31.375 --> 10:35.709
Okay, so here are your approval
ratings from the debate.

10:35.792 --> 10:37.375
As you can see,
great start.

10:37.458 --> 10:40.083
Roger's running around hammering
the mayor from all sides,

10:40.166 --> 10:42.792
and here is where
The Power Team took the stage.

10:42.875 --> 10:44.041
I know you're not
a professional,

10:44.125 --> 10:45.583
but this is
a very high number.

10:45.667 --> 10:48.125
But here, here's where
you drop the baby.

10:48.208 --> 10:49.917
You can almost
see it falling.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.166
Well, what's this right here?
Looks like I rebounded.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.792
That's when people thought
you were going to catch the baby

10:54.875 --> 10:56.291
on the first bounce.

10:56.375 --> 10:58.542
I guess the whole town
is best friends with that baby.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.834
Stan, cheer up.
This is just a little gaffe.

11:00.917 --> 11:02.792
I'll fix it.
-Here's an idea.

11:02.875 --> 11:08.041
Maybe we get some dirt on
that baby, make Stan the hero.

11:08.917 --> 11:11.583
Bye, Mom. My crew and I
are gonna roll up our jeans

11:11.667 --> 11:14.166
and playfully chase
each other on the beach.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.375
Why is he always telling me
where he's going?

11:17.458 --> 11:19.583
So, if Dad wins,
what's gonna be your thing?

11:19.667 --> 11:21.583
You know how first ladies
always have projects

11:21.667 --> 11:22.959
they want
to accomplish?

11:23.041 --> 11:25.583
Hmm, I haven't given
much thought to it.

11:25.667 --> 11:28.709
Been mostly focused on my rat,
but you're right.

11:28.792 --> 11:30.667
I need a project.

11:30.750 --> 11:33.083
Well,
I hate fat kids.

11:33.166 --> 11:36.125
Is there something
I could do with that? Maybe...

11:36.208 --> 11:39.250
-School lunches?
-...ship them away to an island?

11:40.834 --> 11:42.667
Polls are closing soon,
but buckle up

11:42.750 --> 11:44.208
because it's going
to be a long night

11:44.291 --> 11:45.625
before a winner is declared.

11:45.709 --> 11:46.959
Luckily, as always,

11:47.041 --> 11:49.000
we have our Channel 3
election-night panel

11:49.083 --> 11:50.709
of political insiders.

11:50.792 --> 11:53.125
Hooper, Trish,
Detective Turlington,

11:53.208 --> 11:55.417
Joe Chandler,
Tom from the grocery store,

11:55.500 --> 12:00.750
Trey, Billy, James Hetfield,
Devon, Krampus, David Axelrod.

12:00.834 --> 12:03.000
Never mind. The votes are in.
They've called the election.

12:03.083 --> 12:05.583
Apparently, thanks in part
to a mass influx

12:05.667 --> 12:07.333
of 10,000 migrant workers,

12:07.417 --> 12:11.500
it's a landslide victory
for Htims Nats.

12:11.583 --> 12:12.792
Oh, wait.
I read that backwards.

12:12.875 --> 12:14.583
It's Stan Smith.

12:18.375 --> 12:19.375
Have you seen Stan?

12:19.458 --> 12:21.125
No.
Have you seen my crew?

12:21.208 --> 12:22.834
Silly goose,
the election's over.

12:22.917 --> 12:24.792
I could only afford
to rent them for a week.

12:24.875 --> 12:27.792
They're gone, but were all
gonna go with Ashton

12:27.875 --> 12:29.834
to meet his birth mother.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.208
Stan?

12:31.291 --> 12:32.583
Stan,
this is your big night.

12:32.667 --> 12:34.417
What the heck are you doing
up here with your hat?

12:34.500 --> 12:36.333
What have I
gotten myself into?

12:36.417 --> 12:37.750
I don't know
how to be mayor.

12:37.834 --> 12:39.291
What do mayors even do?

12:39.375 --> 12:42.792
I'm, like, in charge of
the libraries and Pizza Huts?

12:42.875 --> 12:44.583
I-I have to approve
all the abortions?

12:44.667 --> 12:47.458
Buddy, take a breath.

12:47.542 --> 12:48.709
Now, think back.

12:48.792 --> 12:50.583
The whole time you were
running for mayor,

12:50.667 --> 12:51.917
it was a pretty
good time, right?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.792
It was cool meeting
The Power Team.

12:53.875 --> 12:56.083
They liked meeting you, too.

12:56.166 --> 12:57.542
You know why
you had a good time?

12:57.625 --> 13:00.208
Because I was doing
all the boring work stuff,

13:00.291 --> 13:01.750
and that's not
gonna change.

13:01.834 --> 13:04.166
The Mayor's job
is to delegate,

13:04.250 --> 13:06.500
so you put me in charge
of building the train,

13:06.583 --> 13:09.000
and you focus
on this fun puzzle.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.041
Oof.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.917
No one said politics
was gonna be easy.

13:17.083 --> 13:21.333
This town can't afford
a $5 billion bullet train.

13:30.250 --> 13:33.250
Hey!

13:45.792 --> 13:48.000
Sorry, but you're gonna
have to push the unveiling.

13:48.083 --> 13:50.959
Oh, really?

13:52.542 --> 13:54.375
Are you snapping at me?

13:54.458 --> 13:57.125
No, I was snapping at my goons
to take you away.

13:57.208 --> 13:58.583
Hey, yeah, it's me.

13:58.667 --> 14:00.125
Why are you guys making me
look like an asshole?

14:00.208 --> 14:02.959
I'm snapping like crazy here
and nothing.

14:03.041 --> 14:04.709
Well, where's Dante?

14:04.792 --> 14:06.583
Are either of the Brocks
available?

14:06.667 --> 14:08.542
Oh, never mind.
I see Scoot.

14:08.625 --> 14:10.667
Shouldn't be
much longer.

14:14.709 --> 14:17.542
First of all,
I'm proud to announce, look.

14:17.625 --> 14:20.583
What was one is two.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.166
Thank you. Thank you.

14:22.250 --> 14:23.583
Now, a lot of people
tried to tell me

14:23.667 --> 14:24.917
that there's no silver bullet

14:25.000 --> 14:27.083
to solving all the problems
in this town,

14:27.166 --> 14:28.375
but I guess those asswipes

14:28.458 --> 14:32.000
have never seen
a silver bullet train.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Oh, I thought
it was gonna be silver.

14:36.083 --> 14:38.291
Hey, cool if I talk
to the crowd?

14:38.375 --> 14:40.333
What --
What are you wearing?

14:40.417 --> 14:41.458
Are those dead rats?

14:41.542 --> 14:44.375
Oh, God, no.
That would be disgusting.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.166
Show him, boys.

14:48.291 --> 14:50.125
Can you handle
this woman?

14:53.583 --> 14:55.500
Is that a bag
full of live rats?

14:55.583 --> 14:56.917
Is that
a T-shirt cannon?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.166
Are you gonna shoot
live rats into the crowd

14:59.250 --> 15:00.792
with a T-shirt cannon?

15:00.875 --> 15:03.333
Well,
I am the First lady.

15:03.417 --> 15:05.291
Sorry, Franny.
Your rat fun is over.

15:05.375 --> 15:07.166
Roger,
get out of my way.

15:07.250 --> 15:10.250
I'm the Mayor's wife,
and you work for him.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.959
Oh, is that
what's going on?

15:13.041 --> 15:14.500
Take her away.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.667
Rats, protect your queen.

15:19.750 --> 15:23.792
Take the form of...
Eiffel Tower.

15:26.375 --> 15:27.792
I taught them that.

15:31.625 --> 15:32.917
Hello, Francine.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.291
Doesn't it feel nice to have
that bag taken off your head?

15:35.375 --> 15:36.667
What's happening?

15:36.750 --> 15:39.166
We've all been deemed
enemies of the state.

15:39.250 --> 15:40.542
To which I say, good.

Look how quickly I made friends.

16:02.291 --> 16:03.375
Huh.

16:03.458 --> 16:05.458
It's rush hour
and no traffic at all.

16:05.542 --> 16:09.583
Can only mean one thing --
bullet train killing it.

16:13.625 --> 16:15.458
That's weird.
Usually by now,

16:15.542 --> 16:18.333
Francine's texted me back
a black thumbs up.

16:18.417 --> 16:20.625
Stan, we must talk.

16:20.709 --> 16:22.792
Your chief of staff
has turned Langley Falls

16:22.875 --> 16:25.041
into
a totalitarian state.

16:25.125 --> 16:26.792
You've become a puppet.

16:26.875 --> 16:28.375
You need to...

16:28.458 --> 16:30.458
That's preposterous.
I'm not a puppet.

16:30.542 --> 16:32.709
I'm real.
I'm a real boy.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.375
Now, listen, Stan.

16:34.458 --> 16:35.583
Aah! Talking cricket!

16:35.667 --> 16:36.917
Aah.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.375
Roger, we need to talk.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.792
I just looked up
what "totalitarian" means,

16:42.875 --> 16:44.792
and I'm concerned.

16:48.083 --> 16:49.667
Francine.

16:49.750 --> 16:53.917
Well, well, well, you finally
put it all together.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.542
Wait, did you finally
put it all together?

16:55.625 --> 16:57.625
-No, I'm very confused.
-Okay.

16:57.709 --> 17:00.250
If you must know,
I've sort of become a despot,

17:00.333 --> 17:02.917
and I've kind of thrown half
the town into the Sharks' Nest,

17:03.000 --> 17:06.208
which I may have turned into
a postapocalyptic prison.

17:06.291 --> 17:07.417
Why would you do this?

17:07.500 --> 17:09.792
Stan, this has always been
about one thing

17:09.875 --> 17:12.917
and one thing only --
Urban Outfitters.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.583
What the hell does your weird
store have to do with this?

17:15.667 --> 17:17.250
I was sick of driving
90 minutes

17:17.333 --> 17:19.166
to buy a pillow
shaped like a taco.

17:19.250 --> 17:22.250
I needed to attract
an Urban Outfitters to Langley.

17:22.333 --> 17:25.125
You know what it takes
to get an Urban Outfitters?

17:25.208 --> 17:26.542
Infrastructure.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.834
That's why your bullet train
was the perfect idea,

17:28.917 --> 17:30.583
and while
I'm admitting stuff,

17:30.667 --> 17:34.583
I also slept with, like, all our
interns, even the chubby one.

17:34.667 --> 17:35.917
His name is Noah.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.500
We're in love, and we don't
care what you think.

17:37.583 --> 17:39.166
You need to close down
that prison.

17:39.250 --> 17:42.417
Are you crazy? That's where
Noah and I had our first kiss.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.250
I'm the Mayor.
I demand it.

17:44.333 --> 17:47.083
Buddy, you think
you're in charge?

17:47.166 --> 17:49.792
I've been in charge
from the very beginning.

17:49.875 --> 17:51.291
Power Team, take him away.

I announce

20:12.041 --> 20:14.000
that I am stepping
down as mayor.

20:14.083 --> 20:17.083
Look, I didn't take
being mayor seriously.

20:17.166 --> 20:19.625
I was an idiot for thinking
I could do this job,

20:19.709 --> 20:21.500
but you're also idiots
for electing me,

20:21.583 --> 20:24.750
so we all share responsibility
for this dumpster fire,

20:24.834 --> 20:26.125
but if I had to pick,

20:26.208 --> 20:28.166
I would say you guys
were the bigger idiots.

20:28.250 --> 20:29.375
Oh, yeah!

20:29.458 --> 20:31.834
It's time for a return
to sensible leadership

20:31.917 --> 20:34.709
as I give the office of mayor
back to a great man,

20:34.792 --> 20:37.625
the unfairly maligned
Alan Woodside.

20:37.709 --> 20:39.917
Come on up here, Alan.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.458
Woodside was stabbed to death
in your illegal prison.

20:44.458 --> 20:45.417
Oh.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.709
Then, eeny, meeny,
miny, moe.

20:47.792 --> 20:51.792
Ooh! I love this city,
and I pledge --

20:51.875 --> 20:55.208
Mmmmmoe -- Garfield.

20:55.291 --> 20:59.792
The streets will run red
with the blood of my enemies!

20:59.875 --> 21:01.083
Parker: Oh, yeah!

21:01.166 --> 21:03.291
Bye-bye. See you soon.

21:05.125 --> 21:07.041
