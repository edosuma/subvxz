[Indistinct Chatter]

00:25.692 --> 00:29.253
[Young Man] In 1899,
the streets of New York City...

00:29.329 --> 00:32.765
echoed with the voices
of newsies...

00:32.832 --> 00:36.962
peddling the newspapers
of Joseph Pulitzer,
William Randolph Hearst...

00:37.037 --> 00:41.337
and other giants
of the newspaper world.

00:41.408 --> 00:44.502
On every corner, you saw 'em
carryin'the banner,

00:44.577 --> 00:47.705
bringin'you the news
for a penny a pape.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.806
Poor orphans and runaways,

00:49.883 --> 00:53.478
the newsies were a ragged army
without a leader.

00:53.553 --> 00:57.785
Until one day,
all that changed.

01:49.075 --> 01:51.669
[Clicking]

01:56.950 --> 01:58.941
Boots!

02:06.126 --> 02:08.060
- I didn't do it.
- What do you mean?

02:08.127 --> 02:10.596
Get up. When you get up,
you have to get up!

02:10.663 --> 02:14.895
Snitch. Get up.
C'mon, everybody's sleepin'.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.301
They sleep, sleep.
They sleep their life away, these kids.

02:18.371 --> 02:21.363
The ink is wet.
The presses are rollin'!

02:21.441 --> 02:23.534
Sell a pape!
Sell a pape!

02:23.610 --> 02:24.975
Hey!

02:25.044 --> 02:29.003

- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with you?

02:37.924 --> 02:41.189
- Get off my back. Hey, go away from me.
- Come on!

02:41.261 --> 02:43.991

- Hey, kid. [Laughing]

02:44.063 --> 02:46.896
Get up, boy.
Come on, come on.

02:46.966 --> 02:48.991

[Chuckling] Did you hear that, fellas.
Hear what Jack said?

03:24.437 --> 03:27.998
I asked Jack how he slept
and he said, "On me back, Mush."

03:28.074 --> 03:31.635
Hey, Jack, when I walk, does

03:31.711 --> 03:34.839
- No. Who says you're fakin' it?
- I don't know.

03:34.914 --> 03:37.849

07:47.934 --> 07:51.370
- Too rotten to be the sewer.

07:51.437 --> 07:54.600

"Baby Born With Two Heads."
Must be from Brooklyn.

Hey, hey, you got your papes.
Now beat it.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.867
I paid for 20
and I only got 19.

11:19.945 --> 11:22.175
[Weasel]
Are you accusing me of lying, kid?

11:22.248 --> 11:24.443
No, I just want my paper.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.747
He said beat it.

11:29.155 --> 11:32.716
No, it's 19, Weasel.
But don't worry about it.

11:32.792 --> 11:35.260
It's an honest mistake.

11:35.327 --> 11:39.127
Morris, he can't count
to 20 with his shoes on.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.758

All right, get outta here.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.667

11:44.737 --> 11:47.399
Thanks. Another 50
for my friend here.

11:47.473 --> 11:49.407
- I don't want another 50.
- Sure you do.

11:49.475 --> 11:53.104
- Every newsie wants more papes.
- I don't.

11:53.179 --> 11:56.080
I don't want your papes.

11:56.148 --> 11:59.982
I don't take charity from anybody,
I don't even know you, I don't care to.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.917
So, here are your papes.

12:01.987 --> 12:05.787
- Cowboy, they call him Cowboy.
- Yeah.

12:05.858 --> 12:09.851
That and a lot of other things,
including Jack Kelly, which is
what my mudder called me.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.022
- What do they call you, kid?
- Les.

12:12.098 --> 12:14.089
And this is my brother, David.
He's older.

12:14.166 --> 12:17.033
- Oh, no kiddin'. How old are you, Les?
- Near ten.

12:17.103 --> 12:20.095
Near ten, that's no good.
If anyone asks, say you're seven.

12:20.172 --> 12:22.538
Younger sells more papes, Les.

12:22.608 --> 12:25.441
- If we're gonna be partners,
we want to be the best...
- Wait, wait!

12:25.511 --> 12:27.445
Who said anything
about partners?

12:27.513 --> 12:30.971
Well, you owe me
two bits, right?

12:31.050 --> 12:36.716
So, I'll consider that an investment.
We sell together, we split...

12:36.789 --> 12:38.984
70/30, plus
you get the benefit...

12:39.058 --> 12:41.583
- of observing me, no charge.
- Ah-ha!

12:41.660 --> 12:43.252
Ah-ha!

12:43.329 --> 12:45.729
You're gettin' the chance
of a lifetime here, Davey.

12:45.798 --> 12:49.825
- You learn from Jack,
you learn from the best.
- The best.

12:49.902 --> 12:53.303
- If he's the best,
then how come he needs me?
- Oooh!

12:53.372 --> 12:56.364
Listen, I don't
need you, pal.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.843
But I ain't got a cute, little brother
like Les to front for me.

12:59.912 --> 13:02.813
With this kid's puss
and my God-given talent,

13:02.882 --> 13:04.941
we could move
a thousand papes a week.

13:05.017 --> 13:08.646
- So, what do you say, Les?
You wanna sell papes for me?
- Yeah!

13:08.721 --> 13:11.986
- So it's a deal?
- Wait, hold it!

13:12.057 --> 13:14.582
It's gotta be
at least 50/50.

13:14.660 --> 13:18.187
- 60/40 or I forget the whole thing.
- That's fair.

13:18.264 --> 13:21.495
- A golden opportunity.
- That's fair, David.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.536
What do you say?

13:26.605 --> 13:28.937
It's very fair.

13:31.410 --> 13:35.278
- What's the matter?
- That's disgusting.

13:39.685 --> 13:41.880
The name of the game
is volume, Dave.

13:41.954 --> 13:45.355
You only took 20 papes.
Why?

13:45.424 --> 13:48.188
- Bad headline.
- That's the first thing you gotta learn.

13:48.260 --> 13:52.663
- Headlines don't sell papes.
Newsies sell papes.
- Newsies, right!

13:52.731 --> 13:56.497
We hold this town together.
Without newsies, nobody knows nuttin'.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.436
- That's right. Hey, fellas.
- Look at that angel.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.370
- What a heaven!
- Whoa!

14:01.440 --> 14:03.806
"Baby Born
With Three Heads!"

14:03.876 --> 14:08.404
- [Chattering]
- Get your papes here!

14:18.123 --> 14:22.082
"Trolley Strike Drags On...

14:22.161 --> 14:24.994
For Third Week."

14:25.064 --> 14:29.558
And this so-called headline
drags on for infinity.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.603
[Man]
The news is slow, Mr. Pulitzer.

14:31.670 --> 14:33.365
The trolley strike's
all we got.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.999
That's all Mr. William
Randolph Hearst has too.

14:36.075 --> 14:39.010
But look how he covers the strike.
Look, look, look!

14:39.078 --> 14:41.046
We'll get a new
headline writer, sir.

14:41.113 --> 14:43.479
We'll steal Hearst's man.
Offer him double.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.712
That's how he stole him from us.
It's not the headlines, Chief.

14:46.785 --> 14:48.912
These circulation wars
are cutting into our profits...

14:48.988 --> 14:52.048
because you spend as much
as you make trying to beat Hearst.

14:52.124 --> 14:54.490
Then we need to make
more profits.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.996
You do not penny pinch
when you're in a war, Seitz.

14:58.063 --> 15:01.294
Victory means everything.
When I created "The World"...

15:01.367 --> 15:04.200
[Shouting]

15:04.270 --> 15:06.636
What is that
deafening noise?

15:09.008 --> 15:12.409
Just the newsies, sir.
I'll go have them quieted.

15:12.478 --> 15:15.641
Never mind the newsies.
[Chuckling]

15:15.714 --> 15:17.648
Where was I?

15:17.716 --> 15:21.413
- Creating "The World," Chief.
- Mmm.

15:23.989 --> 15:27.789
There's lots of money down there
in those streets, gentlemen.

15:27.860 --> 15:31.660
I wanna know how I
can get more of it...

15:31.730 --> 15:33.698
by tonight.

15:33.832 --> 15:36.665
[Indistinct Chattering]

15:41.240 --> 15:43.299
[Cheering]

15:43.375 --> 15:46.742
Extra! Extra!
"Trolley strike drags on!"

15:46.812 --> 15:49.212
Extra, extra!
"Ellis Island in flames!"

15:49.281 --> 15:51.579
- Big conflagration!
- Hey, what?

15:51.650 --> 15:54.915
- Where's that story?
- Thank you, sir. Page nine.

15:54.987 --> 15:57.285
Thousands flee in panic!

15:57.356 --> 15:59.290
Thank you.
Much obliged to you.

15:59.358 --> 16:02.759
"Trash Fire Next To Immigration
Building Terrifies Sea Gulls"?

16:02.828 --> 16:05.490
Terrified flight
from inferno!

16:05.564 --> 16:08.931
Thousands of lives
at stake! Thank you.

16:09.001 --> 16:11.469
- Up here! Up here!
- At the top!

16:11.537 --> 16:14.506
Extra! Extra!
Thank you, sir.

16:14.573 --> 16:17.235
Extra! Extra!

16:17.309 --> 16:19.971
You start in the back like I told ya?
Okay, show me again.

16:20.045 --> 16:24.379
[Coughing]
Buy me last pape, mister?

16:24.450 --> 16:29.285
- It's heartbreakin', go get 'em.
- My father taught us not to lie.

16:29.355 --> 16:32.984
Mine told me not to starve,
so we both got an education.

16:33.058 --> 16:36.050
You're just makin' up things,
all these headlines.

16:36.128 --> 16:38.688
I don't do nuttin' the guys
who write it don't do.

16:38.764 --> 16:41.164
It ain't lyin'.
It's improvin' the truth a little.

16:41.233 --> 16:44.031
[Ringing]

16:44.103 --> 16:48.870
[Crowd Booing]

16:48.941 --> 16:52.138
[Bell Rings]

16:58.150 --> 17:00.311
Right hook.
Hey, come on.

17:00.386 --> 17:03.913
- Look at that!
- Let's go. Strike him.

17:03.989 --> 17:05.923
Come on!

17:05.991 --> 17:08.618
The guy gave me
a quarter!

17:08.694 --> 17:10.888
- Quick, give me
some more of those papes.
- Wait, hold it.

17:10.963 --> 17:13.761
[Sniffing]
You smell like beer.

17:13.832 --> 17:17.290
That's how I made the quarter.
The guy bet me I wouldn't drink some.

17:17.368 --> 17:20.998
Hey, no drinkin'on the job.
It's bad for business.

17:21.073 --> 17:24.236
What if somebody
called a cop on you?

17:24.309 --> 17:27.243
Is he a friend of yours?

17:28.847 --> 17:30.678
Beat it!
It's the Bulls!

17:30.749 --> 17:33.877
[Police Whistle]

17:35.020 --> 17:37.887
[Les] All this
for one sip of beer?

17:40.259 --> 17:43.524
- [Whistle]
- Come on, Les. Come on!

17:43.595 --> 17:46.689
[Man]
Stop, you! Stop, I say!

17:46.765 --> 17:50.724
[Jack] Hurry up, c'mon.
C'mon, hurry up.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.771
[Whistle]

17:55.774 --> 17:59.608
- Up this way!
- I got you. C'mon, let's go.

18:00.212 --> 18:02.578
Sleeper!

18:02.648 --> 18:04.673
Okay, jump.

18:07.219 --> 18:09.153
Hurry up.

18:09.221 --> 18:12.452
- [Jack] He's right behind us.
- Move!

18:14.660 --> 18:17.185
Whoa!

18:18.330 --> 18:21.390
- Where's he at?
- Over here.

18:25.070 --> 18:27.061
Get down.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.733
Sullivan!

18:31.810 --> 18:35.837
Wait 'til I get you
back to the refuge!

18:39.284 --> 18:41.479
I'm not running
any further.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.600
- I want some answers.
- Shh.

18:55.667 --> 18:59.569
Who is he, why was he chasing you
and what is this refuge?

19:01.206 --> 19:03.333
Refuge is this jail
for kids.

19:03.408 --> 19:05.933
The guy chasing me is Snyder.
He's the warden.

19:06.011 --> 19:08.138
- You were in jail? Why?
- Yeah.

19:08.213 --> 19:10.681
I was starvin'
so I stole some food.

19:10.749 --> 19:13.115
- Right, food.
- Yeah, food.

19:13.185 --> 19:17.212
- He called you Sullivan.
- Yeah, my name's Jack Kelly.
You think I'm lyin'?

19:17.289 --> 19:21.555
- You have a way of improving the truth.
- Yeah?

19:21.627 --> 19:23.561
- Why was he chasin' ya?
- 'Cause I escaped.

19:23.629 --> 19:25.062
Oh boy, how?

19:25.130 --> 19:28.156
This big shot gave me
a ride out in his carriage.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.565
I bet it was
the mayor, right?

19:30.636 --> 19:33.400
No, Teddy Roosevelt.
You ever heard of him?

19:33.472 --> 19:35.030
[Lady]
What is going on there?

19:35.174 --> 19:38.075
Out, out, out, out!

19:38.143 --> 19:40.668
You wouldn't kick me out
without a kiss good-bye,
would you, Medda?

19:40.746 --> 19:44.682
Oh, Kelly!

19:44.750 --> 19:47.218
Where you been, kid?

19:47.286 --> 19:50.517
Oh, I miss seeing you
up in the balcony.

19:50.589 --> 19:53.490
Hangin' on
your every word.

19:53.559 --> 19:57.689
- So, Medda, this is David and Les.
- Hello.

19:57.763 --> 20:00.755
- And this is the greatest star
of the vaudeville stage today,
- No.

20:00.832 --> 20:04.268
Miss Medda Larkson,
the Swedish meadowlark.

20:04.336 --> 20:07.897
- "Velcome," gentlemen.
- Medda also owns the joint.

20:07.973 --> 20:11.739
Well, what have we here?

20:11.810 --> 20:15.712
Oh, aren't you
the cutest fellow that ever was.

20:15.781 --> 20:19.877
- Oh yes, you are.
- [Coughing]

20:19.952 --> 20:22.785
Oh, are you
all right?

20:25.724 --> 20:28.625
Buy me last pape, lady?

20:28.694 --> 20:31.185
Oh, you are good.

20:32.531 --> 20:36.695
Oh, yeah,
this kid is really good.

20:36.768 --> 20:41.796
Speaking as one professional to another,
I'd say you've got a great future.

20:41.873 --> 20:44.171
Is it all right if we
stay here for a while?

20:44.243 --> 20:46.234
Just 'til the problem
outside goes away.

20:46.311 --> 20:48.472
Oh, sure, stay
as long as you like.

20:48.547 --> 20:52.005
Toby, give my guests
whatever they want.

20:52.084 --> 20:55.212
Lads, whatever you'd like.

20:55.287 --> 21:00.054
Gumdrops, gumdrops.
Licorice whips.

21:33.425 --> 21:38.260

21:41.566 --> 21:43.727
[Cheering, Applause]

21:47.205 --> 21:50.436
- So you liked that?
- Oh, I loved that.

21:50.509 --> 21:53.637
It was great.
She is beautiful.

21:53.712 --> 21:58.581
- How do you know her?
- She's a friend of my father's.

21:58.650 --> 22:02.677
Come on, Les.
You wanna shine my shoes?

22:04.890 --> 22:10.055
It's gettin' late.
My parents are gonna be worried.

22:10.128 --> 22:14.258
- What about yours?
- They're out west
looking for a place to live.

22:15.767 --> 22:18.361
Like this.

22:18.437 --> 22:21.463
That's Santa Fe, New Mexico.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.633
As soon as they find the right ranch,
they're gonna send for me.

22:23.709 --> 22:25.870
- Then you'll be a real cowboy.
- Yep.

22:25.944 --> 22:29.710
[Indistinct Noise]

22:31.983 --> 22:34.781

22:34.853 --> 22:38.118
Come on, fellas!
Wait up!

22:38.190 --> 22:42.217
[Indistinct Shouting]

22:44.296 --> 22:47.857
Jack, why don't we go back
to my place and divvy up?

22:47.933 --> 22:50.163
You can meet my folks.

22:52.237 --> 22:57.140
It's the trolley strike, Dave,
these dumb asses must not have joined.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.177
Jack, let's get
outta here.

22:59.244 --> 23:02.270
[Bell Clanging]

23:02.347 --> 23:07.375
So, maybe we get
a good headline tomorrow.

23:07.452 --> 23:10.114
Look at this.
He slept through it.

23:12.124 --> 23:14.820
[Shouting]

23:22.734 --> 23:26.602
- My God, what happened?
- Nothin', he's sleepin'.

23:26.671 --> 23:29.572
We've been waiting dinner.
Where have you been?

23:33.879 --> 23:36.404
You made all of this
selling newspapers?

23:36.481 --> 23:39.473
Half of it's Jack's.

23:39.551 --> 23:43.920
This is our selling partner
and our friend,

23:43.989 --> 23:45.980
Jack Kelly, my parents.

23:46.057 --> 23:49.549
- Hello.
- That's my sister, Sarah.

23:52.130 --> 23:56.499
Esther, maybe David's partner
would like to join us for dinner?

23:56.568 --> 24:00.129
Why don't you add a little
more water to the soup?

24:00.205 --> 24:02.230
Mayer.

24:02.307 --> 24:07.074
[Thunder]

24:11.149 --> 24:14.084
[Jack] I gotta say
from what I saw today,

24:14.152 --> 24:16.677
your boys are
a couple of born newsies.

24:16.755 --> 24:19.485
- Can I have a little more?
- Yes.

24:21.059 --> 24:23.050
So with my experience
and their hard work,

24:23.128 --> 24:25.961
I figure we can peddle
a thousand a week,

24:26.031 --> 24:27.692
- not even break a sweat.
- That many?

24:27.766 --> 24:29.961
More when the headlines
are good.

24:30.035 --> 24:33.402
- What makes a headline good?
- Well, you know, um,

24:33.472 --> 24:37.568
catchy words like
"maniac" or "corpse"...

24:37.642 --> 24:41.840
or um, let's see,
"love nest" or "nude."

24:46.651 --> 24:49.176
Excuse me.
Maybe I'm talkin' too much.

24:49.254 --> 24:51.381
Sarah.

24:52.924 --> 24:55.688
Go get the cake your mother's
hiding in the cabinet.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.990
That's for
your birthday tomorrow.

24:58.063 --> 25:01.191
I've had enough birthdays.
This is a celebration.

25:01.266 --> 25:03.359
[David]
I'll get the knife.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.403
[Sarah]
I got the plates.

25:05.470 --> 25:07.904
It's only the beginning.
The longer I work,
the more money I'll make.

25:07.973 --> 25:10.339
You only work until I go
back to the factory.

25:10.408 --> 25:14.105
Then you are going back to
school like you promised.

25:15.046 --> 25:17.014
Happy birthday, Papa.

25:18.550 --> 25:21.678
- Thank you.
- Here's your knife.

25:21.753 --> 25:25.746
This is going to heal.
They'll give me back my job.

25:25.824 --> 25:27.985
[Mayer]
I'll make them.

25:28.059 --> 25:31.426
Our visitor.

25:31.496 --> 25:35.557
[Esther]
Apiece for David.

25:35.634 --> 25:39.695
Thanks.

25:39.771 --> 25:44.208
[Les]
[Music] Come back my lovey dovey baby [music]

25:44.276 --> 25:49.578
[Music] And coochie coo with me [music]

25:52.984 --> 25:55.919
[Esther]
And what is this, David?

25:58.590 --> 26:00.922
So how did your pop
get hurt?

26:00.992 --> 26:04.428
The factory.
It was an accident.

26:04.496 --> 26:08.159
He's no good to them anymore
so they fired him.

26:08.233 --> 26:12.135
He's got no union
to protect him.

26:15.273 --> 26:19.175
David, it's time
to come in now.

26:19.244 --> 26:22.179

stay here tonight?

26:27.852 --> 26:29.786
No, thanks.

- Remember that hot tip?

31:05.563 --> 31:08.555
Nobody told the horse.

31:08.766 --> 31:13.601
I know we need to make more money.
That's why we're here.

31:13.671 --> 31:15.696
I have several proposals.
First,

31:15.773 --> 31:18.901
to increase
the paper's price.

31:18.977 --> 31:23.243
Oh, then Hearst undersells me
and I'm in the poorhouse.

31:23.314 --> 31:25.578
Brilliant, Jonathan,
brilliant.

31:27.418 --> 31:32.219
Not customer price, the price
to the distribution apparatus.

31:32.290 --> 31:35.191
Charge the newsies more
for their papers?

31:35.260 --> 31:37.728
Bad idea, Chief.

31:37.795 --> 31:40.628
Very well,
my next proposal.

31:40.698 --> 31:45.135
Salary cuts,
particularly those at the top.

31:45.203 --> 31:47.671
- Very bad idea.
- Wait, wait, wait.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.105
What do the newsies pay now,
50 cents per 100 papers?

31:50.174 --> 31:53.200
If you raised it to, what?

31:53.278 --> 31:56.270
- Sixty cents?
- A mere tenth of a cent per paper.

31:56.347 --> 31:59.646
That multiplied by 40,000 papers a day.
[Making Adding Machine Sounds]

31:59.717 --> 32:03.244
Seven days a week.
[Adding Machine Sounds]

32:03.321 --> 32:05.551
It definitely adds up, sir.

32:05.623 --> 32:09.491
If you do this, every newsie
we've got will head for Hearst.

32:09.560 --> 32:12.358
You don't know Hearst
like I do.

32:12.430 --> 32:16.628
As newspapermen, he and I would cut each
other's throats to get an advantage.

32:16.701 --> 32:19.226
But as gentlemen
and as businessmen,

32:19.304 --> 32:23.263
we often see eye to eye
on certain things.

32:23.341 --> 32:28.802
Now if we do it,
Hearst and I, if we do it,

32:28.880 --> 32:32.782
then the other papers
will do it.

32:32.850 --> 32:35.944
It's going to be
awfully rough on those children.

32:36.020 --> 32:38.511
Nonsense, nonsense.
It'll be good for them.

32:38.589 --> 32:41.183
Incentive, make them work
harder, sell more papers.

32:41.259 --> 32:45.195
They'll look on it...
as a challenge.

32:45.263 --> 32:47.629
Challenge.

32:47.699 --> 32:51.032
They jacked up the price.

32:51.102 --> 32:53.332
Did ya hear that, Jack?
Ten cents a 100.

32:53.404 --> 32:58.740
It's bad enough we gotta eat
what we don't sell.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.335
Now they jacked up the price!
Can you believe that?

33:01.412 --> 33:04.142
This'll bust me.
I'm barely makin' a living right now.

33:04.215 --> 33:06.183
I'll be back
sleepin' on the streets.

33:06.250 --> 33:10.482
It don't make no sense,
all the money Pulitzer's makin'.
Why would he gouge us?

33:10.555 --> 33:13.319
He's a tightwad,
that's why.

33:13.391 --> 33:15.882
Pipe down,
it's just a gag.

33:15.960 --> 33:19.396
- So why the jack up, Weasel?
- Why not?

33:22.066 --> 33:24.591
It's a nice day.

33:24.669 --> 33:26.694
Why don't you ask
Mr. Pulitzer?

33:26.771 --> 33:29.535
They can't do this
to me, Jack.

33:29.607 --> 33:33.839
[Racetrack] They can do whatever
they want, it's their stinkin'paper.

33:33.911 --> 33:36.573
It ain't fair.
We got no rights at all.

33:36.647 --> 33:39.673
It's a rigged deck.
They got all the marbles.

33:39.751 --> 33:43.152
We got no choice.
Let's get our lousy papes
while they still got some.

33:43.221 --> 33:45.917
- No! Nobody's goin' anywhere!
- We gotta eat, Jack!

33:45.990 --> 33:48.288
They can't get
away with this.

33:48.359 --> 33:51.886
Clear out, give him room.
Give him some room!

33:51.963 --> 33:55.228

Listen,
one thing for sure,

34:17.487 --> 34:19.978
if we don't sell papes,
then nobody sells papes.

34:20.058 --> 34:23.289
Nobody comes through those gates 'til
they put the price back where it was.

34:23.360 --> 34:26.125

- Yeah, like a strike.

34:28.766 --> 34:31.701
- You outta your mind?
- It's a good idea!

34:31.768 --> 34:35.261
Jack, I was joking. We can't strike,
we don't have a union.

34:35.339 --> 34:39.275
Yeah, but if we go on strike,
then we are a union, right?

34:39.342 --> 34:41.538
No, we're just a bunch of
angry kids with no money.

34:41.612 --> 34:45.411
Maybe if we got every
newsie in New York, but...

34:45.483 --> 34:49.976
- We organize.
Crutchy, you take a collection.
- Swell!

34:50.054 --> 34:54.922
- We'll get all the newsies
in New York together.
- This isn't a joke.

34:54.992 --> 34:57.085
You saw what happened
to those trolley workers.

34:57.161 --> 35:00.221
That's a good idea.
Any newsie don't join,

35:00.298 --> 35:03.131
we bust their heads
like the trolley workers.

35:03.201 --> 35:05.726
Stop and think
about this, Jack!

35:05.803 --> 35:09.500
You can't rush
everybody into this.

35:09.574 --> 35:12.634
All right,
let me think about it.

35:12.710 --> 35:14.803
Listen, Dave's right.

35:14.879 --> 35:18.076
Pulitzer and Hearst
and all them rich fellas,

35:18.149 --> 35:21.277
they own this city.

35:21.352 --> 35:24.253
Do we think street rats like us
can make any difference?

35:24.322 --> 35:27.120
The choice
has gotta be yours.

35:27.191 --> 35:31.059
Are we gonna take what they give us
or are we gonna strike?

35:33.464 --> 35:37.025
- Strike!
- Yeah, let's do it!

35:37.101 --> 35:39.092
Keep talkin', Jack.
Tell us what to do.

35:45.309 --> 35:49.006
Yeah, come on, Dave,
tell us what to do.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.014
We gotta stick together.

35:51.082 --> 35:55.951

have to respect our rights.
- All right.

35:56.020 --> 36:00.514
Hey, listen, Pulitzer
and Hearst have to respect...

36:00.591 --> 36:03.788
the rights of the workin' boys

36:07.765 --> 36:11.599

treat us like we don't exist.

we're nothin'. Are we nothin'?
- No!

39:59.797 --> 40:02.357
We gotta get word out to
all the newsies in New York.

40:02.433 --> 40:06.802
I need some of those,
uh, what do you call 'em?

40:06.871 --> 40:09.499
- Ambassadors?
- Yeah.

40:09.573 --> 40:14.033
You guys, you gotta be ambassadors
and go tell the others we're on strike.

40:14.111 --> 40:17.012
- Jack, I'll take Harlem.
- I got midtown.

40:17.081 --> 40:20.244

40:20.317 --> 40:22.751
Bumlets, Specs, Skittery,

40:22.820 --> 40:26.881

40:29.760 --> 40:31.990
What about Brooklyn?
Who wants Brooklyn?

40:32.062 --> 40:34.496
Come on,
Spot Conlon's territory.

40:38.903 --> 40:42.339
- What's the matter, scared of Brooklyn?
- We ain't scared of Brooklyn!

40:42.406 --> 40:45.273
Spot Conlon makes us
a little nervous.

40:45.342 --> 40:49.745
- He don't make me nervous.
You and me, Boots, we'll go.
- All right.

40:49.814 --> 40:52.806
And Dave can keep us company.

40:52.883 --> 40:55.852
- Right, Dave?
- Sure, as soon as you take
our demands to Pulitzer.

40:58.222 --> 41:01.350
- Me to Pulitzer?
- You're the leader, Jack.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.487
Go tell him, Jack!

41:07.898 --> 41:10.196
Maybe the kid'll
soften him up a bit.

41:26.183 --> 41:28.947
[Denton] What is this strike?
What's going on?

41:29.019 --> 41:32.420
We're bringing
our demands to Pulitzer.

41:32.490 --> 41:35.550
- What demands?
- The newsies' demands. We're on strike.

41:37.495 --> 41:40.055
I'm with "The New York Sun."
I'm Bryan Denton.

41:40.130 --> 41:43.896
You seem like the kid in charge.
What's your name?

41:43.968 --> 41:48.564
- David.
- David, as in David and Goliath?

41:50.841 --> 41:54.868
- You really think Pulitzer's
gonna listen to your demands?
- He has to.

41:54.945 --> 41:57.937
- [Man] Out!
- So's your old lady!

41:58.015 --> 42:02.145
- Tell Pulitzer he needs
an appointment with me!
- Yeah!

42:04.989 --> 42:08.652
So this real snooty mug says,
"You can't see Mr. Pulitzer.

42:08.726 --> 42:12.992
No one sees Mr. Pulitzer."
Real hoity-toity, you know.

42:13.063 --> 42:18.865
- Real hoity-toity.
- I said, "I ain't transactin'
business with office boys.

42:18.936 --> 42:22.303
Just tell him Jack Kelly's
here to see him now."

42:22.373 --> 42:25.171
- That's when he threw us out.
- Ha-ha!

42:25.242 --> 42:29.872
Does it scare ya?
You're goin'up against
the most powerful man in New York City.

42:29.947 --> 42:32.438
Look at me,
I'm tremblin'.

42:34.985 --> 42:37.215
All right,
keep me informed.

42:37.288 --> 42:40.223
I wanna know everything
that's going on.

42:40.291 --> 42:43.124
- Are we really an important story?
- Well, what's important?

42:43.193 --> 42:46.162
Last year I covered
the war in Cuba.

42:46.230 --> 42:49.063
Charged up San Juan Hill
with Colonel Teddy Roosevelt.

42:49.133 --> 42:52.398
That was a very
important story.

42:52.469 --> 42:57.702
So, is the newsies' strike important?
It depends on you.

43:02.947 --> 43:05.575
So my name's really
gonna be in the papers?

43:05.649 --> 43:08.880
- Any objections?
- Not as long as you get it right.

43:08.953 --> 43:10.818
Kelly, Jack Kelly.

43:10.888 --> 43:13.789
And Denton?

43:13.857 --> 43:17.452
- No pictures.
- Sure.

43:20.497 --> 43:22.692
[David] I've never been
to Brooklyn, have you?

43:22.766 --> 43:24.927
I spent a month there
one night.

43:25.002 --> 43:28.460
- Watch this.
- [Shouting]

43:34.044 --> 43:38.174
[David] So is Spot Conlon
really dangerous?

43:38.248 --> 43:40.978
[Jack Laughing]

43:56.300 --> 44:00.134
Goin' somewhere, Kelly?

44:02.873 --> 44:05.967
Well, if it ain't
Jack Be Nimble, Jack Be Quick.

44:07.544 --> 44:10.604
You moved up in the world, Spot,
got a river view.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.555
Hey, Boots,
how's it rollin'?

44:23.627 --> 44:25.857
Hey, I got a couple
of real good shooters here.

44:25.929 --> 44:27.897
Yeah.

44:29.633 --> 44:35.333
- So, Jack, I've been hearin'
things from little birds.
- Yeah?

44:35.406 --> 44:38.466
Things from Harlem, Queens.

44:40.244 --> 44:43.270
All over.

44:43.347 --> 44:45.838
They're chirpin' in my ear.

44:45.916 --> 44:48.612
Jackie boy's newsies is playin'
like they're goin' on strike.

44:48.686 --> 44:52.554
- Yeah, we are.
- Well, we're not playin'.
We are goin' on strike.

44:52.623 --> 44:55.820
Oh, yeah, yeah?

44:55.893 --> 44:59.556
What is this,
some kind of walkin' mouth?

44:59.630 --> 45:02.155
Yeah, it's a mouth,
a mouth with a brain.

45:02.232 --> 45:05.201
If you got half of one,
you'll listen.

45:07.671 --> 45:10.834
Go on, tell him.

45:10.908 --> 45:14.708
Well, we started the strike,
but we can't do it alone.

45:14.778 --> 45:17.303
So we've been talkin' to other newsies
all around the city.

45:17.381 --> 45:21.715
Yeah, so they told me.
But what did they tell you?

45:21.785 --> 45:24.219
They're waitin' to see
what Spot Conlon does.
You're the key.

45:24.288 --> 45:30.090
That Spot Conlon is the most respected
and famous newsie in all of New York.

45:30.160 --> 45:33.027
And probably
everywhere else.

45:33.097 --> 45:35.327
And if Spot Conlon joins the strike,
then they'll join.

45:35.399 --> 45:39.893
We'll be unstoppable.
You gotta join us because...
Well, you gotta.

45:39.970 --> 45:43.565
Well, you're right, Jack.
Brains.

45:44.942 --> 45:47.137
But I got brains too.

45:47.211 --> 45:51.204
And more than just
half of one.

45:51.281 --> 45:55.445
How do I know you punks won't run
the first time some goon comes at you?

45:55.519 --> 45:58.044
How do I know you got
what it takes to win?

45:58.122 --> 46:01.489
'Cause I'm tellin' you, Spot.

46:02.526 --> 46:05.586
That ain't good enough,

46:21.812 --> 46:23.837
Jack, so where's Spot?

46:23.914 --> 46:26.610
He was concerned
about us bein' serious.

46:26.683 --> 46:29.811
Maybe we ought to
ease off a little.

46:29.887 --> 46:33.550
Without Spot and the others,
there's not enough of us.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.752
Maybe we're movin' too soon,
maybe we ain't ready.

46:36.827 --> 46:38.954
I definitely think we should
forget about it for a little while.

- Yeah, we're not Brooklyn.

You have a famous friend, this Jack.
Do you know where he lives?

01:04:12.748 --> 01:04:15.649
I never heard of him, honest.

01:04:15.717 --> 01:04:18.584
It's this brain.
It's always makin' mistakes.

01:04:18.653 --> 01:04:21.349
It's got a mind
of its own.

01:04:24.693 --> 01:04:28.686
Can I get you anything
else, Mr. Snyder?

01:04:33.902 --> 01:04:36.769

01:05:00.929 --> 01:05:05.730
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

calls himself Jack Kelly?

Jack... Never heard of him.

heard of Jack Kelly?

01:05:21.316 --> 01:05:23.841

for these parts.

Oh, you mean Jack Kelly!

01:05:28.557 --> 01:05:30.354
Yeah, he was here.

01:05:30.425 --> 01:05:33.417
But he put an egg in
his shoe and beat it.

01:05:33.495 --> 01:05:35.258
[Laughter]

01:05:39.868 --> 01:05:43.861
I have reason to believe
that he is an escaped prisoner,
possibly dangerous.

01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:46.737
Oh! Dangerous?

01:05:46.808 --> 01:05:50.175
[Kloppman]
I better look in my files.

01:05:50.245 --> 01:05:53.908
Oh, this way, please.

01:05:53.982 --> 01:05:56.712

newsie strike fund, mister?

01:05:56.785 --> 01:05:59.686
Huh?

01:06:27.215 --> 01:06:30.912
Did you sleep out there
all night?

01:06:30.986 --> 01:06:32.419
Yeah.

01:06:32.487 --> 01:06:34.717
Why didn't you
wake us up?

01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:39.590
Well, I didn't want
to disturb nobody.

01:06:39.661 --> 01:06:43.461
Anyway, it's like
the Waldorf out here,

01:06:43.531 --> 01:06:46.932

- Yeah.

Good, 'cause
I made you breakfast.

01:07:30.679 --> 01:07:32.909
Papa's so proud
of you and David.

01:07:32.981 --> 01:07:35.848
You should hear him
talking about Jack Kelly,

01:07:35.917 --> 01:07:39.944
the strike leader who occasionally
takes his meals with us.

01:07:40.021 --> 01:07:44.822
This is one strike leader who's gonna
be very happy when it's all over.

01:07:44.893 --> 01:07:48.624
I can get outta here
and go to Santa Fe.

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:53.066
I mean, there's nothin'
for me to stay for, is there?

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:04.406
You should see Santa Fe.
Everything's different there.

01:08:04.479 --> 01:08:06.538
It's all bigger.

01:08:06.614 --> 01:08:10.482
You know, the desert
and the sky and the sun.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.515
It's the same sun
as here.

01:08:14.589 --> 01:08:17.490
Yeah, just looks different.

01:08:17.559 --> 01:08:20.220
I should...

01:08:20.295 --> 01:08:22.229
get ready for work!

01:08:22.296 --> 01:08:27.029
Sarah, I'm just
not used to havin'...

01:08:27.102 --> 01:08:29.502
whether I stay or go
matter to anybody.

01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:39.037
I'm not sayin'
it should matter to you.

01:08:39.113 --> 01:08:42.550
I'm just sayin', um...

01:08:42.617 --> 01:08:47.645
But does it... matter?

01:08:55.563 --> 01:08:58.622
[Mayor] Of course,
the city is very concerned...

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:03.363
that this event doesn't
get out of hand, but...

01:09:03.438 --> 01:09:05.804
Chief?

01:09:05.874 --> 01:09:08.968
We can't just charge in
and break it up, Mr. Pulitzer.

01:09:09.044 --> 01:09:11.308
- We've got no legal cause.
- Legal cause!

01:09:11.379 --> 01:09:16.180
Would the fact that this rally
is organized by an escaped criminal...

01:09:16.251 --> 01:09:18.185
be cause enough, Mayor?

01:09:18.252 --> 01:09:21.313
Escaped criminal?

01:09:21.389 --> 01:09:25.519
Fugitive from
one of your prisons.

01:09:25.593 --> 01:09:27.560
Convicted thief.

01:09:27.629 --> 01:09:33.295
He's been living at large
under the alias of Jack Kelly.

01:09:33.368 --> 01:09:35.301
- What's his real name?
- Sullivan.

01:09:35.370 --> 01:09:38.339
Francis Sullivan,

01:09:38.406 --> 01:09:42.466
Your Honor, I would've caught
him before now, but...

01:09:45.913 --> 01:09:48.542
You know Warden Snyder,
don't you, Mayor?

01:09:48.616 --> 01:09:50.640
I believe you know him
because you... appointed him.

01:09:50.718 --> 01:09:53.015
Yes.

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:56.788
If this boy
is a fugitive,

01:09:56.858 --> 01:09:59.224
- then the chief can quietly arrest him.
- No, no, no.

01:09:59.294 --> 01:10:01.762
Not quietly.
Not quietly!

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:03.821
I want an example made.

01:10:03.898 --> 01:10:07.299
I want this rabble he's roused
to see what happens...

01:10:07.368 --> 01:10:10.030
to those who would dare to...
[Growl]

01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:15.068
They should see justice
in action.

01:10:15.143 --> 01:10:18.840
- Arrest him at the rally.
- By the way, Mayor,

01:10:18.913 --> 01:10:20.847
I'm having a few friends
for cards tonight,

01:10:20.915 --> 01:10:23.748
newspaper friends,
Willie Hearst, Gordon Bennett.

01:10:23.818 --> 01:10:26.582
Perhaps you'll join us.

01:10:26.654 --> 01:10:30.852
Talk about the...
coming election.

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:34.658
I'd be honored.

01:10:52.046 --> 01:10:54.480
Carryin' the banner!

01:10:54.549 --> 01:10:57.780
[Cheering]
Carryin' the banner!

01:10:57.852 --> 01:11:02.152
You know the boys, Mayor.
This is Mr. Bennett
of “The Tribune."

01:11:02.223 --> 01:11:06.455
- Mr. Taylor of “The Times."
- Nice to see you.

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:10.225
- Of course, you know Mr. Hearst.
- Of course.

01:11:10.298 --> 01:11:12.698
This is a new member of
our little group, Mr. Gammon.

01:11:12.767 --> 01:11:15.497
- He just came back from Europe.
- Welcome home.

01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:18.971
Mr. Gammon owns, what?
"The New York Sun."

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.974
Cigar, sir?

01:11:21.042 --> 01:11:23.943
We've come a long way,
but we ain't there yet.

01:11:24.012 --> 01:11:27.413
Maybe it's only gonna
get tougher from now on.

01:11:27.482 --> 01:11:30.747
But that's fine.
We'll just get tougher with it.

01:11:30.818 --> 01:11:33.651
But also,
also we gotta get smart...

01:11:33.721 --> 01:11:38.317
- and start listenin' to my pal, David,
- Yeah!

01:11:38.393 --> 01:11:41.294
Who says,
"Stop soaking the scabs."

01:11:41.362 --> 01:11:43.660
What are we supposed to do
to the bums, kiss 'em?

01:11:45.366 --> 01:11:48.267
Any scab I see,
I soak 'em, period.

01:11:48.336 --> 01:11:50.031
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:11:50.104 --> 01:11:53.699
No! That's what
they want us to do.

01:11:53.775 --> 01:11:56.403
If we get violent,
it's playin' into their hands.

01:11:56.477 --> 01:11:58.877
They're gonna be
playing with my hands.

01:11:58.947 --> 01:12:01.313
This ain't what they say,
it's what we say.

01:12:01.382 --> 01:12:05.045
Nobody ain't gonna listen
to us, unless we make 'em.

01:12:05.119 --> 01:12:08.680
[Shouting]

01:12:08.756 --> 01:12:12.624
You got no brains!
We're starting to fight each other,

01:12:12.694 --> 01:12:14.958
it's just what the
big shots wanna see.

01:12:15.029 --> 01:12:17.623
That we're street trash,
street rats with no brains,

01:12:17.699 --> 01:12:19.860
no respect for nothin'
including ourselves.

01:12:19.934 --> 01:12:24.268
So here's how it is. If we don't
act together, we're nothin'.

01:12:24.339 --> 01:12:28.867
If we don't stick together,
can't trust each other,
then we're nothin'.

01:12:28.943 --> 01:12:31.912
- Tell 'em, Jack!
- So, what's it gonna be?

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.414
We're with you, Jack.

01:12:38.486 --> 01:12:40.750
So what do you say, Spot?

01:12:43.858 --> 01:12:47.453
I say that what you say...

01:12:47.528 --> 01:12:50.088
is what I say.

01:12:50.164 --> 01:12:52.724
[Cheering]

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.735
- Yeah! Yeah!
- All right!

01:13:01.175 --> 01:13:11.449
[music]

01:13:11.519 --> 01:13:14.579
[Music] High times, hard times [music]

01:13:14.656 --> 01:13:17.124
[Music] Sometimes the livin'
is sweet [music]

01:13:17.191 --> 01:13:20.058
[Music] And sometimes
there's nothin' to eat [music]

01:13:20.128 --> 01:13:23.655
[Music] But I always lands
on my feet [music]

01:13:23.731 --> 01:13:27.633
[Music] So when there's dry times [music]

01:13:27.702 --> 01:13:29.966
[Music] I wait for high times
and then [music]

01:13:30.038 --> 01:13:33.804
[Music] I put on my best

01:13:33.875 --> 01:13:37.038
[Music] And I'm off

01:13:37.111 --> 01:13:40.603

- Oh, Medda!

01:13:40.682 --> 01:13:45.085
Hello, newsies?
What's new?

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:57.629
[Medda] [music]So your old lady
don't love you no more [music]

01:13:57.699 --> 01:14:02.432
[Music]So you're afraid there's
a wolf at your door [music]

01:14:02.503 --> 01:14:08.100
[Music]So you got street rats
that scream in your ear [music]

01:14:09.677 --> 01:14:13.738
[Music] You win some
you lose some, my dear [music]

01:14:13.815 --> 01:14:17.683
[Music] Oh, high times
hard times [music]

01:14:17.752 --> 01:14:19.947
[Music] Sometimes the livin'

01:14:20.021 --> 01:14:23.513
[Music] And sometimes

01:14:23.591 --> 01:14:27.118
[Music] But I always lands

01:14:27.195 --> 01:14:30.892

01:14:43.378 --> 01:14:47.280

01:14:50.518 --> 01:14:59.825
[Music] And I'm off

01:15:09.704 --> 01:15:12.832
Excuse me, aren't you
Warden Snyder?

01:15:12.907 --> 01:15:15.603
Bryan Denton of “The Sun."
How do you do, sir?

01:15:19.113 --> 01:15:21.479
I heard about your wonderful
work with the children.

01:15:21.549 --> 01:15:23.983
I wondered if I might
get an interview.

01:15:30.958 --> 01:15:33.085
- Jack!
- Hi, David.

01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:35.425
- It's Snyder.
- What?

01:15:35.496 --> 01:15:39.159
It's Snyder... right there.

01:15:39.233 --> 01:15:43.431
Let me get that correct.
"Snider" as in snide?

01:15:43.504 --> 01:15:45.438
Smile, sir.

01:15:45.506 --> 01:15:48.168
Medda, thanks.
I gotta run.

01:15:48.242 --> 01:15:51.109
[Whistle]

01:15:56.751 --> 01:15:58.378
Hurry.

01:16:00.354 --> 01:16:02.379
No!

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:09.329
No! For God's sake!

01:16:09.397 --> 01:16:14.164
He's just a child.
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

01:16:14.235 --> 01:16:17.329
[Medda]
Racetrack!

01:16:17.405 --> 01:16:19.464
[David]
Get outta here now!

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:23.135
Hey, come here!
Sullivan, I gotcha!

01:16:27.081 --> 01:16:30.847
Go up there.
All right, no, go here.

01:16:33.888 --> 01:16:35.913
Push me.

01:16:38.426 --> 01:16:40.826
Get outta here! Go!

01:16:46.334 --> 01:16:48.734
- Stop where you are.
- Hey, come back!

01:16:48.803 --> 01:16:50.964
Show's over, Cowboy.

01:16:59.013 --> 01:17:02.312
You all right?
Come on.

01:17:13.728 --> 01:17:15.662
Stay back!

01:17:48.429 --> 01:17:51.990
[Man] Arise, arise.
Court is now in session.

01:17:52.133 --> 01:17:55.102
Judge E.A. Monahan presiding.

01:17:55.169 --> 01:17:57.729
Are any of you represented
by counsel?

01:17:57.805 --> 01:18:01.571
No. Good, good.

01:18:01.642 --> 01:18:04.873
- That'll move things along considerably.
- Your Honor, I object.

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:07.710
On what grounds?

01:18:07.782 --> 01:18:12.082
On the grounds of Brooklyn,
Your Honor.

01:18:12.153 --> 01:18:14.348
[Gavel Banging]

01:18:14.422 --> 01:18:16.788
I fine each of you $5.00,

01:18:16.857 --> 01:18:20.816
or two weeks'confinement
in the house of refuge.

01:18:20.895 --> 01:18:24.456
- He said five bucks.
- Whoa. Hey, we ain't got five bucks.

01:18:24.532 --> 01:18:26.625
We don't even got
five cents.

01:18:26.701 --> 01:18:30.933
Your Honor, how 'bout
I roll you for it?
Double or nothing.

01:18:31.005 --> 01:18:32.973
- Move along, move along.
- [Denton] Your Honor,

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:36.134
I'll pay the fines,

01:18:36.210 --> 01:18:38.872
all of them.

01:18:38.946 --> 01:18:41.471
- Fellas, you all right?
- It's David.

01:18:41.549 --> 01:18:44.211
- Where's Jack?
- Look, we got to meet
at the restaurant.

01:18:44.285 --> 01:18:46.344
Everybody.
We have to talk.

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:49.321
Pay the clerk.
Move it along.

01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:52.518
Hey, fellas!

01:18:52.593 --> 01:18:55.619
Hey, Cowboy, nice shiner.

01:18:56.831 --> 01:18:58.560
Pay the clerk.
Move it along.

01:18:58.633 --> 01:19:01.966
Hey, Denton, I guess
we made all the papes this time.

01:19:02.036 --> 01:19:06.166
- How'd my picture look?
- None of the papers covered the rally,

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.174
not even "The Sun."

01:19:08.242 --> 01:19:10.938
Case of Jack Kelly.
Inciting to riot,

01:19:11.012 --> 01:19:13.947
assault, resisting arrest.

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:17.644
Judge Monahan,
I'll speak for this young man.

01:19:18.853 --> 01:19:22.152
You two know each other.
Ain't that nice!

01:19:22.223 --> 01:19:26.319
Just move it along,
Warden Snyder.

01:19:26.394 --> 01:19:29.659
This boy's real name
is Francis Sullivan.

01:19:29.730 --> 01:19:33.461
His mother's deceased,
his father's a convict.

01:19:33.534 --> 01:19:35.798
He's an escapee from
the house of refuge...

01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:38.805
where his sentence for three months
was extended to six months...

01:19:38.873 --> 01:19:43.139
- for disruptive behavior.
- Like demanding we eat the food
you steal from us.

01:19:43.210 --> 01:19:46.179
Followed by an additional
six months for attempted escape.

01:19:46.247 --> 01:19:50.513
Attempted? Last time
wasn't an attempted escape.

01:19:50.584 --> 01:19:54.418
Remember me and Teddy Roosevelt
and the carriage?

01:19:54.488 --> 01:19:57.116
- You remember Roosevelt
and the carriage!
- I ask he be returned...

01:19:57.191 --> 01:20:00.718
- to the house of refuge.
- Away for my own good,
right, move along?

01:20:00.795 --> 01:20:03.764
For my own good and
what he kicks back to you.

01:20:03.831 --> 01:20:07.665
And that the court order his
incarceration until the age of 21...

01:20:07.735 --> 01:20:11.762
in the hope that we may yet guide him
to a useful and productive life.

01:20:11.839 --> 01:20:14.069
So ordered!

01:20:14.141 --> 01:20:16.439
No!

01:20:18.045 --> 01:20:20.605
Next.

01:20:28.389 --> 01:20:30.323
Hey, Mr. Denton!

01:20:34.295 --> 01:20:37.389
- Thanks for bailing us out.
- My pleasure.

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:43.336
- Why didn't "The Sun" print the story?
- Because it never happened.

01:20:43.404 --> 01:20:46.168
What do you mean? It never happened?
You were there!

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:49.471
If it's not in the papers,
it never happened.

01:20:49.543 --> 01:20:53.980
The owners decreed that it
not be in the papers, therefore...

01:20:54.048 --> 01:20:58.451
Anyway, I came to tell
you fellas good-bye.

01:21:00.821 --> 01:21:04.382
- What happened? You get fired?
- No, I got reassigned...

01:21:04.458 --> 01:21:09.020
back to my old job as
"The Sun's" ace war correspondent.

01:21:09.096 --> 01:21:11.121
They want me
to leave right away.

01:21:11.198 --> 01:21:16.898
The owner thinks I should only cover
the really important stories.

01:21:18.038 --> 01:21:22.372
Yep, well,
wish me luck, fellas,

01:21:22.443 --> 01:21:25.003
at least half of what
I wish for you.

01:21:25.079 --> 01:21:29.675
They don't always
fire you, David.

01:21:31.852 --> 01:21:36.255
I would be blackballed from
every paper in the country.

01:21:36.323 --> 01:21:39.292
Hey,

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.555
I'm a newspaperman.

01:21:41.629 --> 01:21:45.725
I have to have a paper
to write for.

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:49.702
This is the, uh,

01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:52.830
story I wrote
about the rally.

01:21:52.907 --> 01:21:54.966
And...

01:21:55.042 --> 01:21:57.704
I want you to read it,
at least.

01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:13.519
Bill?

01:22:13.594 --> 01:22:17.553
- No, no.
- This should cover it. Thanks.

01:22:38.452 --> 01:22:41.080
We get Jack out of
the refuge tonight.

01:22:41.155 --> 01:22:45.285
- From now on, we trust
no one but the newsies.
- Yeah!

01:22:45.359 --> 01:22:48.920
[Racetrack] Come on,
get the lead out of your pants.

01:23:00.107 --> 01:23:03.508
Move along, boy.

01:23:16.190 --> 01:23:18.283
That's where we saw Crutchy.

01:23:18.359 --> 01:23:20.657
[Whistle]

01:23:20.728 --> 01:23:22.821
It's Jack.

01:23:22.897 --> 01:23:25.627
- It's Jack!
- Shh, shh.

01:23:29.737 --> 01:23:30.965
Whoa, boy.

01:23:31.038 --> 01:23:34.872
Where they takin' him, Dave?

01:23:34.942 --> 01:23:37.672
There's one way to find out.

01:23:40.915 --> 01:23:43.850
I'll meet you guys
at the square.

01:23:43.918 --> 01:23:46.352
Racetrack, watch him.

01:24:08.442 --> 01:24:10.672
Whoa, whoa, boy.

01:24:14.214 --> 01:24:16.114
Get him inside.

01:24:16.183 --> 01:24:21.052
[Man] Oh, well, about ready
to wrap up for the night.

01:24:21.121 --> 01:24:24.887
- Gonna be another late one.
- Yes, I know.

01:25:04.531 --> 01:25:06.499
Sit!

01:25:13.507 --> 01:25:17.637
Know what I was doing
when I was your age, boy?

01:25:17.711 --> 01:25:20.612
I was in a war!

01:25:20.681 --> 01:25:26.142
- The Civil War.
- Yeah, I heard of it.
So... did you win?

01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:30.418
People think that wars
are about right or wrong.

01:25:30.491 --> 01:25:32.891
They're not.
They're about power.

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:37.363
I heard of that too.
I don't just sell your papers,
Joe, sometimes I read 'em.

01:25:39.566 --> 01:25:43.297
Power of the press
is the greatest power of them all.

01:25:44.905 --> 01:25:47.066
I tell this city
how to think.

01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:49.541
I tell this city
how to vote.

01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:53.410
I... shape its future.

01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:55.710
Yeah? Well, right now...

01:25:55.783 --> 01:25:58.809
I'm just thinking about
one future and that's mine.

01:25:58.886 --> 01:26:00.911
So am I, boy.

01:26:00.988 --> 01:26:04.446
I have the power to see that
you stay locked in the refuge.

01:26:04.525 --> 01:26:07.016
- And I have the power
to break out again.
- Or...

01:26:07.094 --> 01:26:10.291
I could see you released
tomorrow free and clear...

01:26:10.364 --> 01:26:15.358
with more money in your pockets than
you could earn in... three lifetimes.

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:18.633
Are you bribin' me, Joe?

01:26:18.705 --> 01:26:21.731
Mmm. Well,
no-no-no-no-no.

01:26:21.809 --> 01:26:25.802
It's been nice chattin' with you,
Joe, but I gotta be going now.

01:26:25.879 --> 01:26:27.813
You listen to me, boy.

01:26:27.881 --> 01:26:30.179
Just shut your mouth
and listen to me.

01:26:30.250 --> 01:26:34.414
You shut up and listen
to me for once!

01:26:34.488 --> 01:26:37.389
It's no game I'm playing.

01:26:37.458 --> 01:26:40.552
You work for me
until the strike is over.

01:26:40.627 --> 01:26:44.324
It will end, boy,
make no mistake, without you.

01:26:44.398 --> 01:26:47.060
Then you go wherever you
want to buy a ticket for.

01:26:47.134 --> 01:26:50.126
Away from the refuge,
these foul streets.

01:26:50.204 --> 01:26:52.138
Free!

01:26:52.206 --> 01:26:54.970
With money to spend
and nobody chasing you.

01:27:04.852 --> 01:27:08.618
I must have you scared
pretty bad, old man.

01:27:08.689 --> 01:27:12.250
I offer you freedom
and money just to work for me again.

01:27:12.326 --> 01:27:17.389
To your friends,
I won't be so kind!

01:27:17.464 --> 01:27:21.662
Now your partner,
what's his name, David?
I understand he has a family.

01:27:21.735 --> 01:27:26.138
What do you think the
refuge will do to him?

01:27:26.206 --> 01:27:29.175
And it would be you
who put him there.

01:27:29.243 --> 01:27:32.974
And all the others.
After all, you're their leader.

01:27:36.316 --> 01:27:40.252
Go back to the refuge tonight.
Think about it.

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:44.552
Give me your answer
in the morning.

01:27:49.296 --> 01:27:51.491
Jack, come on!

01:27:51.565 --> 01:27:54.966
Come on! Run!

01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:57.694
After him!

01:28:04.211 --> 01:28:07.408
Don't worry.
He's got no place to go.

01:28:12.719 --> 01:28:16.815
- Come on, keep running!
- You shouldn't have done this, Dave.

01:28:16.890 --> 01:28:19.290
- They could put you in jail.
- I don't care.

01:28:19.359 --> 01:28:21.350
Come here!

01:28:21.428 --> 01:28:25.194
What about your family?
What happens to them if you go in jail?

01:28:25.265 --> 01:28:28.234
You don't know nothin'
about jail.

01:28:28.302 --> 01:28:32.466
Thanks for what you've done,
but you get outta here.

01:28:32.539 --> 01:28:37.135
- I don't understand.
- I don't understand either,
but just get outta here!

01:28:40.214 --> 01:28:43.115
- No!
- Go!

01:29:05.939 --> 01:29:08.407
[Music] Santa Fe [music]

01:29:08.475 --> 01:29:10.773
[Music] My old friend [music]

01:29:10.844 --> 01:29:14.507
[Music] I can't spend
my whole life hiding [music]

01:29:14.581 --> 01:29:19.575
[Music] You're the only light
that's guidin' me today [music]

01:29:21.054 --> 01:29:22.919
Psst, Jack.

01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:26.858
Look. I snitched it off of
Snyder's plate when I was serving him.

01:29:26.927 --> 01:29:30.454
It's the biggest one.
Oh, Mr. Snyder was eating good tonight.

01:29:30.530 --> 01:29:32.464
You know, the stuff
that we don't never get.

01:29:32.532 --> 01:29:37.333
Potatoes, olives,
even bacon, sauerkraut.

01:29:37.404 --> 01:29:40.237
Guess what I done
to his sauerkraut.

01:29:40.307 --> 01:29:43.572
- So what's it get ya?
- Another three months.

01:29:43.644 --> 01:29:45.578
But you can't let him
beat ya, right, Jack?

01:29:45.646 --> 01:29:47.637
That's what you always say.

01:29:47.714 --> 01:29:51.980
We was beat when we was born.

01:29:57.824 --> 01:30:01.123
[Music] Will you keep
a candle burnin' [music]

01:30:01.194 --> 01:30:03.924
[Music] Will you help me
find my way [music]

01:30:03.997 --> 01:30:08.093
[Music] You're my chance
to break free [music]

01:30:08.168 --> 01:30:11.228
[Music] And who knows
when my next one will be [music]

[Music]Santa Fe [music]

01:30:14.441 --> 01:30:18.309
[Music] Wait for me [music]

01:30:32.926 --> 01:30:37.488
[Chanting]
Stop "The World." No more papes.

01:30:37.564 --> 01:30:44.060
Stop "The World."
No more papes.

01:30:44.137 --> 01:30:46.901
Cheese it!
Cheese it!

01:30:46.973 --> 01:30:51.501
- Cheese it! Race, please help me.
- All right, I ain't deaf.

01:30:51.578 --> 01:30:56.538
Hey, hey, hey.
Break it up.

01:30:56.616 --> 01:30:58.777
Hold it right there.

01:30:58.852 --> 01:31:02.845
- Hey, Race, come here.
- What?

01:31:02.923 --> 01:31:05.221
Tell me I'm just seein' things.
Just tell me I'm seein' things.

01:31:05.292 --> 01:31:08.159
[Racetrack]
You ain't seein'things. That's Jack.

01:31:08.228 --> 01:31:11.061
- What's he doin'?
- He's dressed like a scabber.

01:31:11.131 --> 01:31:14.862
Jack, look at me, will ya?
Come on, it's me, Mush.

01:31:14.935 --> 01:31:16.994
Look at me!
What're you doing?

01:31:17.070 --> 01:31:20.403
This ain't happening!
What are you doin', Jack?

01:31:20.474 --> 01:31:22.567
Hey, what is this?

01:31:22.642 --> 01:31:26.635
- Where'd you get them clothes?
- Mr. Pulitzer picked them.

01:31:26.713 --> 01:31:31.047
- A special gift
to a special new employee.
- He sold us out.

01:31:31.118 --> 01:31:35.020
Look at him in his little suit.
Ya bum! I'll soak ya!

01:31:35.088 --> 01:31:37.750
- Ya fink!
- Let me get my hands dirty.

01:31:37.824 --> 01:31:41.419
Come here, you dirty,
rotten scabber!

01:31:41.495 --> 01:31:43.986
[Shouting]

01:31:44.931 --> 01:31:46.899
I'll murder ya!

01:31:50.303 --> 01:31:53.363
Oh, you want to talk to him.
Come on, sure.

01:31:58.845 --> 01:32:01.211
Go right ahead.

01:32:07.454 --> 01:32:10.651
So this is why you
didn't escape last night.

01:32:10.724 --> 01:32:14.524
- Yeah.
- You're a liar.

01:32:14.594 --> 01:32:18.462
You lied about everything.

01:32:18.532 --> 01:32:21.990
You lied about your father
being out west.

01:32:22.068 --> 01:32:27.165
- You didn't even tell me your real name.
- So? What you want to do about it?

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:29.299
I don't understand you.

01:32:29.376 --> 01:32:32.812
So let me spell it out for ya.

01:32:32.879 --> 01:32:37.441
You see, I ain't got nobody
tucking me in at night like you.

01:32:37.517 --> 01:32:40.042
It's just me.
I gotta look out for myself.

01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:43.647
- You had the newsies!
- What'd being a newsie give me...

01:32:43.723 --> 01:32:47.250
but a dime a day
and a few black eyes?

01:32:47.327 --> 01:32:51.696
I can't afford to be a kid
no more, Dave.

01:32:51.765 --> 01:32:56.759
For the first time in my life
I got money in my pockets. Real money!

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:58.964
Money. You understand?

01:32:59.039 --> 01:33:02.202
I got more on the way and as soon
as I collect, I'm gone, all right?

01:33:02.275 --> 01:33:05.802
That's good 'cause
we don't need you.

01:33:05.879 --> 01:33:08.439
We don't need you!

01:33:08.515 --> 01:33:11.075
All those words you said,
those were mine.

01:33:11.151 --> 01:33:15.645
But you never had the guts
to put 'em across yourself.

01:33:15.722 --> 01:33:18.020
I do now.

01:33:33.073 --> 01:33:35.268
What's the matter?

01:33:35.342 --> 01:33:37.503
Got a problem?

01:33:37.577 --> 01:33:42.810
Maybe, maybe you'd like
a new suit of your own, huh?

01:33:42.883 --> 01:33:45.943
- Never!
- Get outta here! Off with him.

01:33:55.395 --> 01:33:57.363
You make me sick!

01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:59.455
- Look at yourself, huh?
- I trusted you.

01:33:59.533 --> 01:34:01.398
Seize the day, huh, Jack?

01:34:01.468 --> 01:34:05.461
He's foolin' 'em
so he can spy on 'em or something.

01:34:05.539 --> 01:34:08.372
Yeah, that's it.
He's foolin' 'em.

01:34:08.441 --> 01:34:11.205
Yeah, he's spyin'
on 'em, kid.

01:34:22.355 --> 01:34:24.323
Les,

01:34:24.391 --> 01:34:28.327
what is this?

01:34:31.031 --> 01:34:33.659
I'm savin' it.

01:34:36.903 --> 01:34:38.928
David,

01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:43.036
it's Denton's article.

01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:46.636
"The Dark Truth,
Why Our City Really Fears
The Newsies' Strike...

01:34:46.713 --> 01:34:48.681
"by Bryan Denton.

01:34:48.748 --> 01:34:51.911
"Last night I saw naked force
exercised against mere boys,

01:34:51.985 --> 01:34:55.477
the newsies, who were the..."

01:35:07.834 --> 01:35:11.463
One trick, Cowboy,
and it's right back to the refuge.

01:35:11.538 --> 01:35:13.472
Please.

01:35:25.518 --> 01:35:29.852
Ah, you gonna be requiring
anything else this evening?

01:35:29.923 --> 01:35:33.620
No? Ah, tsk, tsk.

01:35:33.693 --> 01:35:37.459
Well then, I oughta
be saying good night.

01:35:38.898 --> 01:35:43.631
Remember... one trick
and I go straight to Mr. Pulitzer.

01:35:52.679 --> 01:35:55.807
[Weasel]
Move along, gentlemen, move along.

01:35:55.882 --> 01:35:58.009
20 papes. Next.

01:35:58.084 --> 01:36:00.746
- 20 papes, please.
- Next.

01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:02.720
- 30 papes, please.
- Yes, sir.

01:36:02.789 --> 01:36:05.349
30 papes. Next.

01:36:05.425 --> 01:36:08.292
- I'll take, uh, 50.
- 50 papes!

01:36:08.361 --> 01:36:11.762
50 papes. Next.

01:36:17.237 --> 01:36:19.330
Sleep well, Cowboy?

01:36:19.406 --> 01:36:24.309
Come with us, Cowboy.
We're gonna go fix your pal Davey.

01:36:24.377 --> 01:36:27.744
- Fix him so he can't walk.
- Shut up!

01:36:27.814 --> 01:36:32.478
Uh-uh. Lift one finger,
it's back to the refuge.

01:36:37.691 --> 01:36:39.625
Next!

01:36:39.693 --> 01:36:42.389
50.

01:36:46.832 --> 01:36:49.300
- Good mornin'.
- Good mornin' to ya.

01:36:52.103 --> 01:36:54.094
'Scuse me, sweet face.

01:37:00.979 --> 01:37:03.413
- How's your little brother, tootsie?
- [Laughing]

01:37:03.482 --> 01:37:05.473
Where's the little Davey?

01:37:08.653 --> 01:37:11.087
Leave my sister alone!

01:37:15.894 --> 01:37:19.591
[Sarah]
Stop it! Leave him alone!

01:37:25.770 --> 01:37:28.330
You stupid ape.

01:37:30.542 --> 01:37:32.134
No!

01:37:32.210 --> 01:37:34.678
- What happened? Are you hurt?
- No, I'm all right.

01:37:34.746 --> 01:37:37.408
- Help Sarah.
- [Sarah] Run, Davey!

01:37:37.482 --> 01:37:39.416
Oh, yeah, run, Davey.

01:37:39.484 --> 01:37:43.545
We got the best part
of your family right here.

01:37:43.622 --> 01:37:47.149
Let go of me!
Stop it!

01:37:47.225 --> 01:37:50.388
- Get up!
- [Sarah] Les!

01:37:50.462 --> 01:37:54.057
Stop, you're hurting him.
No! Leave him alone!

01:38:04.442 --> 01:38:06.433
[Sarah]
Stop it!

01:38:06.511 --> 01:38:09.742
Leave him alone!

01:38:27.499 --> 01:38:29.729
Get over here!

01:38:30.802 --> 01:38:34.238
Remember Crutchy?

01:38:34.306 --> 01:38:37.901
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:38:39.244 --> 01:38:41.235
David?

01:38:43.281 --> 01:38:46.307
You better run, Cowboy.
We're gonna tell Uncle Weas.

01:38:46.384 --> 01:38:50.844
- You'll be back in the
refuge by supper time.
- Run, ya lousy coward.

01:38:50.922 --> 01:38:54.551
[Les] Run, get outta here!
Don't come back.

01:38:56.061 --> 01:38:59.553
What? You couldn't stay away?

01:38:59.631 --> 01:39:02.293
Well, I guess I can't
be something I ain't.

01:39:02.367 --> 01:39:04.335
A scab?

01:39:04.402 --> 01:39:06.336
No, smart.

01:39:10.342 --> 01:39:12.469
Did you mean
what you wrote here?

01:39:12.544 --> 01:39:15.479
About all these sweatshop
kids listening to me?

01:39:15.547 --> 01:39:18.448
I don't write anything
I don't mean.

01:39:18.516 --> 01:39:22.509
Well, come on in.
I was just packing a few things.

01:39:32.230 --> 01:39:34.391
So, yes, I meant it.

01:39:34.466 --> 01:39:37.833
The city thrives
on child labor.

01:39:37.902 --> 01:39:39.927
A lot of people
make money that way.

01:39:40.005 --> 01:39:42.838
They're terrified that
the newsies strike will spread.

01:39:42.907 --> 01:39:45.171
There's not much chance
of that...

01:39:45.243 --> 01:39:47.734
as long as
they got the power.

01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:52.709
Sometimes all it takes
is a voice.

01:39:52.784 --> 01:39:55.844
One voice
that becomes a hundred,

01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:58.480
and then a thousand...

01:39:58.556 --> 01:40:00.319
unless it's silenced.

01:40:04.062 --> 01:40:06.292
Why can't we spread
the strike?

01:40:06.364 --> 01:40:10.164
Have another big rally and get
the word out to all the sweatshop kids?

01:40:10.235 --> 01:40:13.466
- Why not?
- What are we gonna do?
Put an ad in the paper?

01:40:13.538 --> 01:40:16.871
We'll do better than that.
We'll make our own paper.

01:40:16.941 --> 01:40:19.967
We tell 'em they gotta join us.
Isn't that a good idea?

01:40:20.045 --> 01:40:25.142
Yeah, it is. But what do we know
about printing a newspaper?

01:40:25.216 --> 01:40:29.152
- Nothing, but our man, Denton...
- But I think our man, Denton,

01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:33.020
has something more
important to do.

01:40:33.091 --> 01:40:37.255
I mean, he's gonna be
an ace war correspondent.

01:40:37.328 --> 01:40:39.660
Right, Denton?

01:40:44.235 --> 01:40:46.294
All right.

01:40:46.371 --> 01:40:48.703
[Denton]
Where do we start?

01:40:48.773 --> 01:40:51.333
We gotta move fast.

01:40:51.409 --> 01:40:54.173
We're gonna need
the newsies to circulate.

01:40:54.245 --> 01:40:56.406
[Denton]
We need a printing press.

01:40:56.481 --> 01:41:00.417
So happens I know a guy
with a printing press.

01:41:04.189 --> 01:41:07.522
- You've been living here?
- Shh! They're above us.

01:41:07.592 --> 01:41:11.153
If weasel catches us,
we're all in the slam.

01:41:24.275 --> 01:41:28.371
All right!
A platen press!

01:41:28.446 --> 01:41:31.506
Looks like old man Pulitzer
never threw anything away.

01:41:31.583 --> 01:41:36.247
- Will this thing work?
- It better. We have a deadline.

01:41:36.321 --> 01:41:38.312
[Music] This is the story
you wanted to write [music]

01:41:38.389 --> 01:41:41.119
[Music] Well tonight is a night
that you can [music]

01:41:41.192 --> 01:41:43.490
[Music]Just get this done

01:41:43.561 --> 01:41:46.621

you began [music]

01:41:46.698 --> 01:41:49.098
[Music] This time we're in it
to stay [music]

01:41:49.167 --> 01:41:51.795
[Music] Think about
seizing the day [music]

01:41:51.870 --> 01:41:55.772
[Music] Think of that train as
she rolls into old Santa Fe [music]

01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:57.740
[Music] Tell 'em I'm on my way [music]

01:41:57.809 --> 01:42:02.644
[Music]See ol'man Pulitzer
snug in his bed he don't
care if we're dead or alive [music]

01:42:02.714 --> 01:42:04.807
[Music] Three satin pillows
are under his head [music]

01:42:04.883 --> 01:42:07.977
[Music] While we're begging
for bread to survive [music]

01:42:08.052 --> 01:42:10.680
[Music]Joe, if you're still
countin'sheep [music]

01:42:10.755 --> 01:42:13.383
[Music] Wake up and read 'em
and weep [music]

01:42:13.458 --> 01:42:15.551
[Music] You got your thugs with
their sticks and the slugs [music]

01:42:15.627 --> 01:42:18.892
[Music] Yeah, but we got
a promise to keep [music]

01:42:18.963 --> 01:42:24.026
[Music] Once and for all something
tells me the tide'll be turnin'[music]

01:42:24.102 --> 01:42:26.434
[Music] Once and for all
there's a fire inside me [music]

01:42:26.504 --> 01:42:29.667
[Music] That won't stop burning [music]

01:42:29.741 --> 01:42:32.039
[Music]Now that the choices
are clear [music]

01:42:32.110 --> 01:42:34.578
[Music]Now that tomorrow is here [music]

01:42:34.646 --> 01:42:39.413
[Music] Watch how the mighty can fall
for once and for all [music]

01:42:39.484 --> 01:42:43.181
It's nice of Mr. Pulitzer
to let us use his press.

01:42:43.254 --> 01:42:45.950
I just hope I get
to thank him for it some day.

01:42:49.727 --> 01:42:51.558
[Music] This is for kids
shining shoes in the streets [music]

01:42:51.629 --> 01:42:54.723
[Music] With no shoes on
their feet every day [music]

01:42:55.967 --> 01:43:00.427
Hey, kid, can you read?
Read that.

01:43:00.505 --> 01:43:03.997
Take this. Read these.

01:43:04.075 --> 01:43:06.475
Know how to read?

01:43:06.544 --> 01:43:07.943
Read that, all right?

01:43:08.012 --> 01:43:10.139
Carryin' the banner!

01:43:10.215 --> 01:43:16.211
[Music] Once and for all we'll be
there to defend one another [music]

01:43:16.287 --> 01:43:18.346
[Music] Once and for all

01:43:18.423 --> 01:43:21.119
[Music]Every friend a brother [music]

01:43:21.192 --> 01:43:25.026
- Hey, meeting in the square.
- Support the newsies.

01:43:25.096 --> 01:43:29.499
[Music]Five thousand reasons to try
we're going over the wall [music]

01:43:29.567 --> 01:43:32.161
[Music]Better to die than to crawl [music]

01:43:32.237 --> 01:43:34.671
[Music]Either we stand or we fall [music]

01:43:34.739 --> 01:43:45.707
[Music]For once once and for all [music]

01:43:56.461 --> 01:44:00.420
Disgraceful, Denty!
Those poor boys!

01:44:00.498 --> 01:44:03.296
I thought you'd feel
this way, Governor.

01:44:03.368 --> 01:44:08.738
And I did nothing...

01:44:08.806 --> 01:44:11.036
until now.

01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:14.772
Good, very good, sir.

01:44:20.785 --> 01:44:23.879
So when's the others
comin', kid?

01:44:23.955 --> 01:44:28.392
They ain't comin'.
Ain't gonna be nobody but us.

01:44:35.733 --> 01:44:39.362

- Have hope, Jack.

01:44:48.713 --> 01:44:51.477

bell starts ringin' [music]

01:44:51.549 --> 01:44:55.349

01:45:01.492 --> 01:45:04.359

[Cheering]

01:45:52.377 --> 01:45:55.938
We're gonna strike!
We're gonna strike!

01:45:56.014 --> 01:45:58.574
Get back!

01:46:02.787 --> 01:46:06.917
[Chanting]
Strike! Strike!
Strike! Strike!

01:46:16.367 --> 01:46:19.393
- Yeah!
- Yes!

01:46:19.470 --> 01:46:22.303
Dear me,
what have we here?

01:46:22.373 --> 01:46:25.740
[Chanting]
Strike! Strike!

01:46:30.681 --> 01:46:33.115
It's awful, everyone's calling.
Mr. Hearst, Mr. Benton...

01:46:33.184 --> 01:46:35.175
and the mayor,
and such awful language.

01:46:35.253 --> 01:46:37.221
The city's at a standstill
and they all blame the chief.

01:46:37.288 --> 01:46:41.850
It's like the end of the world.
Oh, dear, I didn't say that.

01:46:49.767 --> 01:46:51.860
Extry! Extry! Joe!

01:46:55.406 --> 01:46:57.874
Read all about it.

01:47:06.617 --> 01:47:12.180
I promised that if you defied me,
I would break you.

01:47:14.358 --> 01:47:16.588
I'll keep that promise, boy.

01:47:16.661 --> 01:47:20.529
I gave you the chance to be free.
I don't understand.

01:47:20.598 --> 01:47:24.762
Anyone who doesn't act
in his own self-interest...

01:47:24.836 --> 01:47:27.566
is a fool.

01:47:27.638 --> 01:47:31.096
- What does that make you?
- What?

01:47:31.175 --> 01:47:34.508
This is my pal, David,

01:47:34.579 --> 01:47:36.513
the walking mouth.

01:47:36.581 --> 01:47:38.742
You talk about self-interest,
but since the strike...

01:47:38.816 --> 01:47:41.546
your circulation
has been down 70%.

01:47:41.619 --> 01:47:43.519
Every day you're losing
thousands of dollars...

01:47:43.588 --> 01:47:46.056
just to beat us out of
one lousy tenth of a cent.

01:47:46.124 --> 01:47:49.821
Why?

01:47:49.894 --> 01:47:51.862
[Jack]
It ain't about the money, Dave.

01:47:51.929 --> 01:47:56.559
If Joe gives in
to nobodies like us,

01:47:56.634 --> 01:47:59.000
that means
we got the power.

01:47:59.070 --> 01:48:03.530
He can't do that no matter
what it costs. Am I right, Joe?

01:48:03.608 --> 01:48:06.805
I sent for the police.
They must be here by now.

01:48:06.878 --> 01:48:10.143
Send 'em in, Seitz.
Send 'em in.

01:48:11.282 --> 01:48:14.012
I'm not goin' back
to jail, Joe.

01:48:14.085 --> 01:48:16.451
Look at here. Right out here
is right where your power ends!

01:48:16.521 --> 01:48:19.217
[Pulitzer] Shut the windows!
Close the windows!

01:48:19.290 --> 01:48:23.454
Stop that infernal noise!
Go home!

01:48:23.528 --> 01:48:26.656
- Go home! Go home!
- I don't hear you, Joe!

01:48:26.731 --> 01:48:28.858
[Pulitzer]
Go home to your mothers and fathers!

01:48:28.933 --> 01:48:31.697
- Go home! You listen to me!
- I can't hear ya!

01:48:31.769 --> 01:48:35.364
- Maybe you should listen
to me for a change.
- No, you listen to me!

01:48:35.439 --> 01:48:38.704
- No, you should listen!
- Shut the window and shut up!

01:48:38.776 --> 01:48:42.507
There's a lot of people out there!
They ain't gonna go away!

01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:44.605
They got voices now
and they're gonna be listened to.

01:48:44.682 --> 01:48:46.980
Putting me in jail
is not gonna stop them.

01:48:47.051 --> 01:48:50.646
That's the power
of the press, Joe.

01:48:52.156 --> 01:48:55.148
[Door Closes]

01:48:55.226 --> 01:48:57.524
Thanks for teachin' me
about it.

01:48:57.595 --> 01:49:01.998
Those kids put out
a pretty good paper, Chief.

01:49:06.170 --> 01:49:08.968
[Pulitzer] I ordered
a printing ban on all strike matters.

01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:11.372
Now who defied it?

01:49:11.442 --> 01:49:15.742
Whose press did you use
to print this? Whose?

01:49:17.782 --> 01:49:21.513
Well, we only used
the best, Joe.

01:49:21.586 --> 01:49:24.020
So I just wanna say,

01:49:24.088 --> 01:49:26.022
thanks again.

01:49:35.233 --> 01:49:37.360
Hey, fellas,
they're over here.

01:49:37.435 --> 01:49:40.700
They're over here.

[Indistinct Chatter]

01:49:45.977 --> 01:49:49.970
What'd they say, huh?
What'd they say?

01:49:59.490 --> 01:50:02.084
[Jack]
We beat 'em!

01:50:21.145 --> 01:50:23.272
All right!

01:50:28.252 --> 01:50:31.187

Excuse me, excuse me.

01:50:34.625 --> 01:50:37.822

It's the Bulls, let me down!

01:50:40.231 --> 01:50:42.392
[Indistinct]

01:50:42.466 --> 01:50:44.434
No, Jack, it's over.

01:50:44.502 --> 01:50:47.471
- Let's go!
- No, no, no! You don't have to run.

01:50:47.538 --> 01:50:50.564
Not anymore.
Not from the likes of him.

01:50:50.641 --> 01:50:53.235
Come on, come on.

01:51:07.758 --> 01:51:11.194
[Boy] Hey, Crutchy,
come on outta there.

01:51:12.530 --> 01:51:14.691
Uh, remember what
I told ya, Mr. Snyder.

01:51:14.765 --> 01:51:20.032
The first thing you do in jail,
make friends with the rats.

01:51:20.104 --> 01:51:23.505
Share what
you got in common.

01:51:23.574 --> 01:51:28.136
- Uh, Officer, may I, please?
- Sure, kid.

01:51:30.448 --> 01:51:33.815

01:51:37.121 --> 01:51:39.715

- Hey, guys!

01:51:39.790 --> 01:51:42.122
You won't be seein'
much of him anymore.

01:51:42.193 --> 01:51:44.457
- Say good-bye, Warden.
- Bye!

01:51:44.528 --> 01:51:48.658
[Shouting]

01:51:48.733 --> 01:51:50.496
Jack, you ought
to have seen it.

01:51:50.568 --> 01:51:54.402
He come stormin' into the refuge wavin'
his walkin' stick like a sword.

01:51:54.472 --> 01:51:56.667
And he's leadin' this
army of lawyers and cops...

01:51:56.741 --> 01:52:01.201
- Who comes walkin' in?
- You know, your friend, him!

01:52:01.278 --> 01:52:05.578
[Crutchy]
Teddy Roosevelt.

01:52:05.649 --> 01:52:09.745
The governor's very grateful you brought
this problem to his attention.

01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:12.948
I said you might need a lift somewhere.
He's glad to oblige.

01:52:13.023 --> 01:52:17.221
Anywhere you want,
and this time you ride inside.

01:52:18.929 --> 01:52:22.558
Could he drop me
at the train yards?

01:52:24.301 --> 01:52:26.895
Yeah, if that's
what you want.
