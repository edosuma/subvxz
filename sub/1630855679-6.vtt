00:06.297 --> 00:07.257
[Nami] Easy. Easy!

00:08.758 --> 00:09.801
Easy.

00:09.884 --> 00:12.053
Easy. Don't drop him.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.222
I didn't. He's really heavy.

00:14.305 --> 00:17.517
I mean, he's got a really big head.
It's, like, freakishly big.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.602
[Nami] What does that
have to do with anything?

00:19.686 --> 00:22.480
-Zoro? Hey, can you hear me?
-[Usopp] Where's the first aid kit?

00:22.564 --> 00:24.774
-[Nami] Do we have a first aid kit?
-Zoro?

00:28.611 --> 00:30.989
[Usopp] These are all I could find.
Where's he bleeding from?

00:31.072 --> 00:31.948
[Nami] Everywhere.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.159
-[Usopp] We need more towels.
-[Nami] We need a doctor.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.869
[Usopp] Last I checked, we don't have one.

00:35.952 --> 00:37.704
[Nami] Luffy? Luffy!

00:39.080 --> 00:41.249
Someone needs to go back to Baratie.

00:41.833 --> 00:44.252
Um, I'm really not hungry right now, Nami.

00:44.335 --> 00:45.712
[Nami] Not for food.

00:45.795 --> 00:48.214
Maybe one of the customers
is a ship's doctor.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.717
Right. A doctor.

00:51.968 --> 00:52.969
We need a doctor.

00:54.679 --> 00:57.557
-[Zeff] What do you think you're doing?
-Chopping carrots, chef.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.976
Yeah, I can see that.
But why are you doing it in my kitchen?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.061
I demoted you, remember?

01:01.144 --> 01:03.772
That you did. But Patty's
sleeping off a brutal hangover,

01:03.855 --> 01:06.441
so unless you want to do brunch prep
all by yourself…

01:08.526 --> 01:09.360
Fine.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.697
Them carrots are cut too thick.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.075
And those eggs are way too runny.

01:15.784 --> 01:20.288
And I can tell just by looking at that,
that rémoulade needs a lot more oregano.

01:21.664 --> 01:23.124
Oregano is for savages.

01:23.708 --> 01:24.918
[Luffy] Help! Help!

01:25.960 --> 01:28.296
Help! Help! Zoro… Zoro needs a doctor.

01:28.379 --> 01:31.049
He got into a fight with this warlord guy,
but he lost.

01:31.132 --> 01:34.135
-And now he's bleeding from everywhere--
-Whoa. Whoa. Slow down, Chore Boy.

01:34.219 --> 01:37.555
-I can't understand a word you're saying.
-My friend is dying.

It's a two-day sail from here.

01:40.558 --> 01:41.518
That's too long.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.561
I can't help you.
Hope your friend makes it.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.063
Where do you think you're going?

01:45.146 --> 01:47.982
-To help Chore Boy's friend.
-Brunch is not gonna prep itself.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.859
You always told me
to feed anyone who's hungry.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.820
I don't see how this is any different.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.321
[sighs]

01:53.988 --> 01:54.906
Fine.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.785
Bring me my kitchen knives
and a bottle of our best whiskey.

01:58.868 --> 02:01.830
And a fresh yellowtail from the cooler.
Bigger the better.

02:01.913 --> 02:02.872
A yellowtail?

02:02.956 --> 02:04.541
Just do it already.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.503
[theme music plays]

02:16.094 --> 02:18.054
Are you kidding? He needs a doctor.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.390
Do you wanna save
your swordsman friend or not?

02:27.105 --> 02:29.232
-Is that to sterilize the wounds?
-[Zeff] Hell, no.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.234
That'd be a waste of really good liquor.

02:34.696 --> 02:35.530
Beautiful.

Needle.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.426
Fish skin.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.806
This is an old seaman's trick.

03:02.807 --> 03:07.103
The fish skin helps staunch the wounds
and heals the flesh a lot faster.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.022
Is he gonna be okay?

03:09.105 --> 03:11.274
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.
He's lost a lot of blood.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.320
-It might be too late for him.
-But it might not be.

03:15.403 --> 03:19.157
He's got one foot in each world right now,
caught between life and death.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.578
You have to find a way
to keep him tethered to our world.

03:24.162 --> 03:28.333
Talk to him. Tell him stories.
Sing him sea shanties for all I care.

03:29.417 --> 03:30.835
He may not reply,

03:32.170 --> 03:34.380
but at least he'll know
his crew are still with him.

03:47.393 --> 03:50.521
I thought this was a conversation
we might have privately.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.607
Dismissed, cadet.

03:54.734 --> 03:55.568
Aye, sir.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.160
[Garp] So where is he?

04:04.744 --> 04:05.703
Where's Luffy?

04:05.787 --> 04:09.123
-At the moment, I don't know.
-What do you mean, you don't know?

04:09.707 --> 04:11.000
I decided to let him go.

04:11.084 --> 04:15.588
I specifically told you
to bring him to me.

04:15.672 --> 04:19.133
Come now, Vice-Admiral.
I don't take orders.

04:19.217 --> 04:21.094
Not even from the likes of you.

04:21.177 --> 04:23.012
As one of the Seven Warlords,

04:23.096 --> 04:25.473
you serve at the pleasure
of the World Government.

04:25.556 --> 04:29.310
-Without our immunity--
-I would still do precisely what I want.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.937
No more and no less.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.438
And what I want

04:32.939 --> 04:36.609
is to see what becomes of that young man
when he enters the Grand Line.

04:36.693 --> 04:37.568
Ha!

04:38.903 --> 04:40.321
I won't let that happen.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.824
Then you have
your work cut out for you, Vice-Admiral,

04:42.907 --> 04:46.119

-Never waste food.
-[Usopp] Cool.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.605
What's the matter? Don't like fish?

05:56.356 --> 05:59.650
I love fish. I just need
to get Zoro's sword ready for him.

05:59.734 --> 06:02.028
You know, for when he wakes up.

06:06.657 --> 06:07.700
He's, uh,

There's an itty-bitty chance
he might not wake up.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.125
Zoro's the strongest fighter that I know.

06:16.793 --> 06:20.171
No way he's gonna let
some warlord guy beat him.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.631
Well, you've gotta eat.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.927
Come on. If you don't want the fish,
I got two-inch T-bones in the kitchen.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.805
Or, uh, maybe you're in the mood
for saffron risotto?

06:29.347 --> 06:31.682
I normally would get both,

06:31.766 --> 06:35.436
but I really gotta get
the Waddy Itchy Monkey ready for him.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.938
-The what?
-His sword.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.357
It's got a name.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.274
Oh.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.402
-Why?
-[Luffy] I don't know.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.195
He said it was kind of special.

Hey, Sanji, can you cook
Zoro's favorite food?

06:49.242 --> 06:51.577
Sure. What does he like?

06:52.912 --> 06:55.123
-He really likes rice balls.
-Mm-hmm.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.040

06:56.124 --> 06:58.000
What about rice balls soaked in beer?

06:58.084 --> 06:59.669
-Can you make that?
-[Sanji laughs]

06:59.752 --> 07:02.547
I can make anything.
Just tell me what you want.

07:03.339 --> 07:04.465
I want him to eat

07:05.258 --> 07:06.968
so that he gets back his strength.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.972
But I also want him to sleep
so that his wounds can heal.

07:11.848 --> 07:15.017
Or maybe…
maybe he just needs some water. Right?

07:15.643 --> 07:19.063
After all of that fighting,
he must be awfully thirsty. [chuckles]

07:19.147 --> 07:21.899
But, you know,
he's probably also tired, so…

07:22.483 --> 07:25.862

Being a captain,
it's the toughest job in the world, okay?

07:32.201 --> 07:33.035
Zeff once told me

07:33.119 --> 07:37.540
that making decisions is what separates
a captain from the rest of his crew.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.711
And he was one of the best pirate captains
that ever sailed the seas.

07:41.794 --> 07:42.920
Zeff was a pirate?

07:43.004 --> 07:47.216
Yeah. Captain of the dreaded Cook Pirates.
They used to call him "Red Leg Zeff,"

07:47.300 --> 07:50.303
'cause his boots were always stained
with the blood of his enemies.

to flaunt their illegal activities.

39:20.524 --> 39:23.652
They are becoming more than a nuisance

39:25.029 --> 39:26.697

So get out of my restaurant now.
