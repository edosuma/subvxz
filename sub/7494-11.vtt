WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:03.437
Last time on
Make It Pop.

00:03.471 --> 00:04.605
Look what they
did to my--

00:04.638 --> 00:06.040
They can't cancel
Homecoming!

00:06.074 --> 00:08.242
I hear Homecoming's
being moved to Club Ry Ri!

00:08.276 --> 00:09.710
Sun Hi: Without the
schools permission.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.712
Jodi: If Jared doesn't
notice you after this

00:11.745 --> 00:12.713
he doesn't
deserve you.

00:12.746 --> 00:13.214
(phone ringing)

00:13.247 --> 00:14.248
It's my father...

00:14.282 --> 00:15.516
He's coming for a visit.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.086
(birds chirping)

00:21.222 --> 00:22.723
Excited for auditions
today, Mr. Stark?

00:22.756 --> 00:23.924
I know I am.

00:23.957 --> 00:27.228
The start of a new project
brings both excitement and fear.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.629
Now, where did I
put my--

00:28.662 --> 00:30.098
Notebook? Here
you are, sir.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.500
I took the liberty of
putting my name in it

00:32.533 --> 00:34.102
with a 'ten' next
to performance.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.769
That's quite
hopeful of you.

00:35.803 --> 00:38.472
Isn't hope the first step on
the road to accomplishment?

00:38.506 --> 00:40.708
You read that in my
notebook, didn't you?

00:40.741 --> 00:41.709
And it was beautifully put.

00:41.742 --> 00:44.345
Just like that picture
of you riding a giraffe.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.546
That's a Shakespearean steed!

00:45.579 --> 00:47.248
I'm here to read
for Dorothy...

00:47.281 --> 00:48.416
And I'm gonna
nail it,

00:48.449 --> 00:51.285
so you might as well cancel
the rest of the auditions.

00:51.319 --> 00:54.388
This class certainly does
not lack for confidence.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.524
With chins like
these, why would we?

00:56.557 --> 00:58.659
Jared, let's
audition together

00:58.692 --> 01:00.661
and show Mr. Stark our
romantic chemistry.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.496
It's The Wonderful
Wizard of Oz.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.398
There's nothing
romantic about it.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.400
We'll see about that.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.236
Yeah, I've been
known to make

01:08.269 --> 01:10.704
common household
chores romantic.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.374
This is really not how I
envisioned this beginning.

01:13.407 --> 01:17.010
*

01:17.044 --> 01:18.879
Five hundred hits!?

01:18.912 --> 01:20.848
We're, like, famous
party promoters now!

01:20.881 --> 01:23.584
The secret Homecoming
was off the charts.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.986
Except for the part where
we got caught and banned

01:26.019 --> 01:27.988
from the next school
outing because of it.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.056
Oh no!

01:29.089 --> 01:30.991
Missing the trip to see
the city's sewage lagoons?

01:31.024 --> 01:33.026
I'm devastated.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.197
Why are you
texting me?

01:36.230 --> 01:39.600
I want to know what you think of
my new online campaign.

01:39.633 --> 01:42.136
"Save Oz. Sun Hi
for Dorothy."

01:42.170 --> 01:43.771
Too subtle?

01:43.804 --> 01:44.805
Guys...

01:44.838 --> 01:46.274
I need to talk--

01:46.307 --> 01:48.676
Mr. Stark: Attention students.
Acting and Orchestra auditions

01:48.709 --> 01:51.945
for the Musical, today,
four PM sharp.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.547
We're going to
kill that audition.

01:53.581 --> 01:54.682
I really need to--

01:54.715 --> 01:56.517
Want to hear the
greatest news ever?

01:56.550 --> 01:58.886
Stark already
cast me as Dorothy?

01:58.919 --> 01:59.887
No.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.689
He saw my costumes and
wants me to design Oz?

02:01.722 --> 02:02.256
No.

02:02.290 --> 02:02.956
Guys, I really need to--

02:02.990 --> 02:04.992
I came up with
a band name!

02:05.025 --> 02:05.826
Really?

02:05.859 --> 02:06.827
I thought we'd
never think of one.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.663
Just using my initials
has a nice ring to it.

02:09.697 --> 02:10.931
You know, S H
something?

02:10.964 --> 02:13.534
How about s h h
don't talk?

02:13.567 --> 02:15.503
No, it's way
better than that.

02:15.536 --> 02:18.972
We should announce
it at Club Ry Ri!

02:19.006 --> 02:20.941
I need to get
the word out.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.710
Now.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.246
And the name is?

02:25.279 --> 02:28.682
So glad he came all this
way to not tell us the name.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.083
Well that's a relief.

02:30.117 --> 02:33.187
The band name is the
final piece of the puzzle.

02:33.221 --> 02:35.055
Now we can drop
our first single,

02:35.088 --> 02:36.657
fight off high-powered
agents and--

02:36.690 --> 02:37.791
I can't do it!!!

02:37.825 --> 02:39.059
What?

02:39.092 --> 02:41.929
Audition for the play, perform
at Club Ry Ri or be in the band.

02:41.962 --> 02:45.065
I can't do any of it.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.534
I'm sorry guys.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.102
I'm out.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.609
* Make it pop, woo, woo

02:55.643 --> 02:59.547
* Make it pop, woo, woo

02:59.580 --> 03:01.081
* I can't wait

03:01.114 --> 03:03.951
* no I can't wait No,
I can't wait, no *

03:03.984 --> 03:05.219
* I can't wait

03:05.253 --> 03:06.820
* So make it pop

03:06.854 --> 03:09.056
* We're bout to,
we're bout to blow *

03:09.089 --> 03:10.658
* Wait till we drop

03:10.691 --> 03:12.660
* Oh ya, we're
ready to go *

03:12.693 --> 03:13.694
* Ain't gonna stop,

03:13.727 --> 03:16.096
* When is it,
time for the show *

03:16.129 --> 03:18.098
* We make it, you make it,

03:18.131 --> 03:19.132
* They make it

03:19.166 --> 03:21.935
* M-m-m-m-m-m-
Make it pop *

03:23.371 --> 03:25.138
Sun Hi: What are
you talking about?

03:25.172 --> 03:26.139
We're a team, Corki.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.775
We need you--

03:27.808 --> 03:28.842
My father is
coming.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.945
If he finds out I'm in a
band, he'll send me home,

03:31.979 --> 03:33.881
I'll be waited on
hand and foot,

03:33.914 --> 03:37.017
and travel the world
under constant

03:37.050 --> 03:38.252
supervision of
security guards.

03:38.286 --> 03:39.753
That sounds awesome.

03:39.787 --> 03:40.754
I like it here.

03:40.788 --> 03:44.024
Being a regular student,
with regular friends.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.827
Corki, why would your dad
care if you're in a band?

03:46.860 --> 03:47.728
Because I'm
supposed to

03:47.761 --> 03:49.830
take over the family
business one day.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.032
He didn't grow his company
into a worldwide brand

03:52.065 --> 03:54.234
by making time
for pop music.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.637
Worldwide brand?

03:56.670 --> 03:57.905
You mean you're
that Chang?!

03:57.938 --> 03:59.006
You know my father?

03:59.039 --> 04:00.073
Know him?

04:00.107 --> 04:02.776
He's like one of the
richest people in the world.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.044
Is this your big secret?

04:04.077 --> 04:05.913
I didn't want people
to like me

04:05.946 --> 04:07.748
just because of
who my father is.

04:07.781 --> 04:08.782
I get it.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.784
I'm glad we became
besties before I found out.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.220
Now you can never doubt the
purity of our friendship.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.122
So how much is he
actually worth?

04:15.155 --> 04:16.724
I've heard somewhere
in the billions.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.257
Sun Hi!

04:17.291 --> 04:18.459
What?

04:18.492 --> 04:22.396
If I'm going to be a supportive
friend, I need the facts!

04:22.430 --> 04:24.197
For example: does
he have a safe?

04:24.231 --> 04:26.634
And do you have a
combination to that safe?

04:26.667 --> 04:28.369
Corki, ignore her.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.804
You're in the band.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.005
We'll figure
the rest out.

04:32.039 --> 04:32.940
Absolutely.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.274
We're all in
this together.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.209
True friends.

04:36.243 --> 04:38.779
So does your allowance
come in an armored truck,

04:38.812 --> 04:40.180
or how does that work?

04:41.281 --> 04:44.084
DJ Maxwell: Today has been a
crazy day in the pod-iverse...

04:44.117 --> 04:45.118
but I've gotta take off.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.321
Hey, make sure to download
the latest podcast,

04:47.355 --> 04:49.690
or stream it
anytime online.

04:49.723 --> 04:53.093
I promise to give you the
latest and coolest new artists.

04:53.126 --> 04:57.230
I'm DJ Maxwell, and
this is The Max Attack.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.232
(knocking)

04:59.266 --> 05:01.735
Hi.

05:01.769 --> 05:02.703
Dude.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.237
Not you again.

05:04.271 --> 05:05.773
Please, don't
call security.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.841
I'm offering you
an interview with

05:07.875 --> 05:09.377
the hottest new
band in town.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.979
Let me guess, is
this your band,

05:12.012 --> 05:13.847
What a great guess!

05:13.881 --> 05:16.249
We have a special performance
coming up at a club.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.150
Really.

05:17.184 --> 05:17.885
Well, technically,
it's a roller rink.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.020
But it doubles
as Club Ry Ri.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.889
I don't think
I've heard of it.

05:21.922 --> 05:22.523
Exactly.

05:22.556 --> 05:23.857
That's why
we need you.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.459
This band is
going to blow up.

05:25.493 --> 05:26.460
I've heard this before.

05:26.494 --> 05:27.861
But not from me.

05:27.895 --> 05:28.396
Yes.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.330
Actually from you.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.833
Last time you
snuck in here.

05:32.866 --> 05:33.967
Good point.

05:34.001 --> 05:37.137
But we need promo and you
can announce the band name

05:37.170 --> 05:39.006
and gives us our big break.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.742
What do you say?

05:41.775 --> 05:42.843
I like your persistence.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.713
You kinda remind me of
myself when I was your age.

05:45.746 --> 05:48.248
Aren't you only like a
couple years older than me?

05:48.281 --> 05:49.483
Wait, careful.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.952
If I agree to help
you out with this,

05:51.985 --> 05:55.255
will you just please promise
to never sneak in here again?

05:55.288 --> 05:56.857
Yes...?

05:56.890 --> 06:00.428
I have zero confidence
in that yes.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.431
Why are you
such a slob?

06:03.464 --> 06:05.433
My father could
arrive any moment.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.366
I'm not a slob.

06:06.400 --> 06:11.204
I'm an advocate for
free-range clothing.

06:11.238 --> 06:13.441
It says here you
have seven jets!?

06:13.474 --> 06:16.343
Those gossip sites
always exaggerate.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.545
We only have five.

06:17.578 --> 06:20.914
Five? Can we take one and use it
to tour around the world?

06:20.948 --> 06:23.250
It doesn't exactly
work that way.

06:23.283 --> 06:25.919
So I guess a private yacht
with a helipad painted

06:25.953 --> 06:28.456
a pretty shade of pink is
out of the question?

06:28.489 --> 06:30.190
Not entirely.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.059
So you can have
anything you want?!

06:32.092 --> 06:33.126
No, That's silly.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.328
When I was little, I wanted
my very own unicorn

06:35.362 --> 06:36.930
and I only got a pony.

06:36.964 --> 06:37.865
Harsh.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.434
I can just imagine
what it would be like...

06:42.169 --> 06:48.141
* I put my hands
up in the air *

06:48.175 --> 06:51.211
* S-U-N Hi

06:51.244 --> 06:54.815

* I put my hands up in the air

08:31.211 --> 08:33.146
* Make everybody
stop and stare *

08:33.180 --> 08:35.916
* Write my name
across the sky *

08:35.949 --> 08:37.117
* I'm a superstar

08:37.150 --> 08:39.587
* I put my hands
up in the air *

08:39.620 --> 08:41.655
* Make everybody
stop and stare *

08:41.689 --> 08:44.424
* Write my name
across the sky *

08:44.457 --> 08:45.993
* I'm a superstar

08:46.026 --> 08:50.564
* I put my hands up in the air

08:50.598 --> 08:51.565
* Yeah, yeah

08:51.599 --> 08:53.567
* Write my name across the sky

08:53.601 --> 08:55.035
* I'm a superstar

08:55.068 --> 08:57.437
* I put my hands up in the air

08:57.470 --> 08:59.206
* Yeah, yeah

08:59.239 --> 09:01.975
* Write my name across the sky

09:02.009 --> 09:04.511
* I'm a superstar

09:08.148 --> 09:10.417
But people always get the
wrong idea about money

09:10.450 --> 09:12.019
I have a lot of things,

09:12.052 --> 09:14.354
but things aren't
friends you know...

09:14.387 --> 09:15.923
I could totally give
you guys up for

09:15.956 --> 09:18.091
"anything in the world."

09:18.125 --> 09:19.426
You are damaged,
Sun Hi.

09:19.459 --> 09:21.228
You love it.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.964
Guys, great news!

09:23.997 --> 09:26.299
Corki's dad's flight was
diverted and he's not coming?

09:26.333 --> 09:27.167
No.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.401
And when you interrupt
me like that,

09:28.435 --> 09:29.302
it really ruins my
momentum.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.271
You're going to tell
us the band name?

09:31.304 --> 09:32.139
No, not that either.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.642
I scored us an interview
with DJ Maxwell!

09:34.675 --> 09:36.509
Seriously?

09:36.543 --> 09:37.510
That's amazing.

09:37.544 --> 09:38.511
Ouh what'll I wear?

09:38.545 --> 09:40.280
He's coming
at four o'clock.

09:40.313 --> 09:41.649
O - M- G!

09:41.682 --> 09:43.717
My voice is going to
be downloaded by

09:43.751 --> 09:45.552
millions of people all
around the world.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.655
Hash tag blushing.

09:47.688 --> 09:48.555
Four?

09:48.588 --> 09:48.956
Today?

09:48.989 --> 09:49.923
On the dot.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.992
But that's the same
time as our auditions.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.260
We can't miss
the interview.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.327
My million downloads!

09:54.361 --> 09:56.129
We can't miss the auditions,
My killer costumes!

09:56.163 --> 09:58.131
We can't do the interview
at MacKendrick -

09:58.165 --> 09:59.332
my father will catch us!

09:59.366 --> 10:01.534
We'll find a really
private place to do it.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.270
He'll never find us.

10:03.303 --> 10:06.039
(knocking)

10:06.073 --> 10:09.076
Father!

10:12.412 --> 10:14.648
Corki: And that's where I
memorized the periodic table.

10:14.682 --> 10:17.350
And that's where I studied
rudiments for corporate law.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.619
I could recite them
for you if you like.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.288
What's going on here?

10:21.321 --> 10:23.256
Just auditions for
the school musical.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.457
Are you involved with it?

10:24.491 --> 10:25.458
No!

10:25.492 --> 10:29.997
I mean other than trying
out for the orchestra.

10:30.030 --> 10:33.000
Well, I'm sure you'll find the
time for all of your interests.

10:33.033 --> 10:36.704
That's what I'd like.

10:38.205 --> 10:41.041
DJ Maxwell: You know what, I
checked you guys out online.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.175
You're trending.

10:42.209 --> 10:46.179
Of course, I record everything
for the Sun Hi Nation!

10:46.213 --> 10:48.315
Including now!

10:48.348 --> 10:49.182
Okay...

10:49.216 --> 10:50.550
Wait, what are you
doing over there?

10:50.583 --> 10:51.518
Is everything okay?

10:51.551 --> 10:52.319
Yes!

10:52.352 --> 10:53.586
I'm just making
sure we're not...

10:53.620 --> 10:55.455
interrupted.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.458
This is actually pretty
nice digs for an interview.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.159
Yes.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.461
This room is in
high demand.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.697
Not sure when it's
booked next, actually.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.432
So let's hurry up,
chop chop.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.334
But where is
Masked Girl?

11:07.367 --> 11:08.802
Is she showing
up or what?

11:08.836 --> 11:13.707
Uh... well... no.

11:13.741 --> 11:14.641
No?!

11:14.674 --> 11:16.076
She can't join us today.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.177
Well that's too bad.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.612
Because I'm not doing an
interview without the star.

11:19.646 --> 11:20.280
Star?!

11:20.313 --> 11:21.715
Masked Girl is not the star!

11:21.749 --> 11:23.751
Yes, she's talented,

11:23.784 --> 11:26.686
but I'm the one with that
special quality you can't--

11:26.720 --> 11:29.622
Here's the thing, if
she's not here, I'm out.

11:29.656 --> 11:34.194
I'll get her.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.231
So... are these auditions
happening here and now,

11:38.265 --> 11:39.432
or on the astral plane?

11:39.466 --> 11:39.867
(laughing)

11:39.900 --> 11:41.634
The astral plane

11:41.668 --> 11:43.837
First up, Jared
Anderson!

11:43.871 --> 11:44.437
Whoo!

11:44.471 --> 11:48.475
(clapping)

11:49.743 --> 11:53.246
A dramatic reading of The
Wonderful Wizard of Oz

11:53.280 --> 11:58.351
as seen through the eyes of the
Scarecrow and the Tin Wood Man.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.721
'Tis hard to live in
Oz without a brain,

12:01.755 --> 12:07.360
to think a simple
thought is a strain.

12:07.394 --> 12:10.397
'Tis even harder
without a heart,

12:10.430 --> 12:12.800
it makes your tummy's
funny like you need to f--

12:12.833 --> 12:14.501
Thank you, Jared!

12:14.534 --> 12:15.803
Wait, I'm not done.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.838
The two sides
dance battle!

12:20.440 --> 12:22.409
Ms. Diona: Less is
often more, Mr. Stark.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.411
And it's looking like
less auditorium

12:24.444 --> 12:27.414
and more tearing down.

12:27.447 --> 12:31.151
Thank you, Jared.

12:31.184 --> 12:34.221
Nobody wins in
this dance battle.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.156
Next...

12:37.457 --> 12:39.226
And this is the
student clubs board,

12:39.259 --> 12:44.264
where I never look for
frivolous pastimes --

12:47.167 --> 12:48.235
Corki!

12:48.268 --> 12:50.170
Mr. Chang, sir.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.404
When I was in school,

12:51.438 --> 12:53.306
they didn't allow
running in the halls.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.374
Oh.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.508
Right.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.310
They don't here either.

12:57.344 --> 13:00.313
Unless it's a...
learning emergency.

13:00.347 --> 13:03.450
Which reminds me -- Corki,
you promised to help me

13:03.483 --> 13:06.719
with that very important...
math equation.

13:06.753 --> 13:08.721
You know, the one
where if a DJ

13:08.755 --> 13:11.591
was promised three singers
and only two show up,

13:11.624 --> 13:15.462
how long will it take before
there's nothing left?

13:15.495 --> 13:19.732
But I told you Sun Hi, I
can't solve that math problem.

13:19.766 --> 13:22.669
It's too complicated.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.405
But you're the only one
who can solve that problem.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.407
I used to be pretty
good in math.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.675
Perhaps I can help.

13:28.708 --> 13:31.344
No!

13:31.378 --> 13:32.679
What we meant was...

13:32.712 --> 13:34.614
we'd love your
help, father,

13:34.647 --> 13:38.818
it's just our school
has a strict...

13:38.852 --> 13:43.356
no help from
parents policy.

13:43.390 --> 13:46.193
Seems harsh, but
what are ya gonna do?

13:46.226 --> 13:48.628
Well, then I guess
I'll see you

13:48.661 --> 13:53.400
at the orchestra
auditions later.

14:00.273 --> 14:05.645
Caleb: Hey, how about,
We interview you.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.848
What's your favorite
kind of soup?

14:08.882 --> 14:13.253
Cream of "I Don't
Have Time For This".

14:13.286 --> 14:14.654
No, wait!

14:14.687 --> 14:18.525
Ah you don't have to answer
questions about soup.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.327
Yeah.

14:20.360 --> 14:26.900
What's your favorite
kind of... soap?

14:27.534 --> 14:28.001
We're here!

14:28.035 --> 14:30.503
We made it!

14:44.451 --> 14:46.019
Lose the
monkeys - now!

14:46.053 --> 14:47.687
Next.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.256
Mr. Chang!

14:49.289 --> 14:51.358
How are you enjoying
the tour?

14:51.391 --> 14:52.492
Fine.

14:52.525 --> 14:53.893
I'm just waiting for my
daughter's orchestra audition.

14:53.927 --> 14:54.761
Great.

14:54.794 --> 14:55.728
She is so talented.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.431
I am sure she is in
the show, no problem.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.033
Only if she deserves it.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.834
I don't believe
in favoritism.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.570
Then I'm suddenly
confused about

15:03.603 --> 15:05.805
how to best kiss-up to
you and your money.

15:05.838 --> 15:11.844
Um, seat, here have a seat,
it's the best seat in the house.

15:11.878 --> 15:14.447
Mr Stark: Next, bricks
of the yellow road.

15:15.882 --> 15:17.584
DJ Maxwell loved us.

15:17.617 --> 15:18.851
And our band name, too.

15:18.885 --> 15:19.852
I know, right?

15:19.886 --> 15:21.588
It's perfect!

15:21.621 --> 15:24.324
We are so late for
the auditions!

15:24.357 --> 15:27.760
Corki: I need my violin!

15:29.496 --> 15:32.765
Orchestra hopefuls,
please come forward.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.936
We were the best.

15:36.970 --> 15:39.339
I can't believe he didn't
cast us on the spot.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.374
I think I have hay
in my pants.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.343
The acting
auditions are over.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.878
We totally blew it.

15:45.912 --> 15:48.348
At least you can still
audition for the orchestra.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.984
Yeah, Corki, go ahead.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.453
Make him proud.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.855
But... I wanted to
make us proud.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.624
Don't beat yourself up.

15:57.657 --> 16:00.560
We're very hard
to please.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.362
Corki, good,
you're here.

16:02.395 --> 16:05.065
We'll start with you...

16:18.545 --> 16:28.555
*

16:28.588 --> 16:33.860
*

16:33.893 --> 16:35.528
Can you imagine
the awesome things

16:35.562 --> 16:38.965
we could have done
with that sound?

16:39.766 --> 16:50.043
People in the house, put
your hands together for XO-IQ!

16:50.077 --> 16:53.946
* Waited some time for
the hand of fate *

16:53.980 --> 16:58.051
* Dreaming a dream I
can hardly wait *

16:58.085 --> 17:01.854
* We are gonna be
a part of it *

17:01.888 --> 17:05.792
* No stopping us now
the fire is lit *

17:05.825 --> 17:07.860
* Blast off now hear
the sonic boom *

17:07.894 --> 17:09.896
* Everybody's gotta get
down in the room *

17:09.929 --> 17:11.898
* Shoot for the stars
we'll wave to the moon *

17:11.931 --> 17:13.733
* When the lightning
strike go zoom zoom zoom *

17:13.766 --> 17:17.804
* We're taking over
better step aside *

17:17.837 --> 17:21.408
* We'll hit the road but
we'll still need a ride *

17:21.441 --> 17:24.043
* We're gonna get to
work on a grand design *

17:24.077 --> 17:26.012
* Tag you in a post
when we get online *

17:26.045 --> 17:29.982
* ...If we have the time

17:30.016 --> 17:33.986
* Turn up the spotlights
we're on our way *

17:34.020 --> 17:37.724
* Turn up the spotlights
we wanna play *

17:37.757 --> 17:45.998
* We'll get it, I bet it, were
gonna be stars one day *

17:46.032 --> 17:49.802
* All we gotta do
is write a song *

17:49.836 --> 17:53.873
* Then we'll get
our own emoticon *

17:53.906 --> 17:57.877
* Everywhere we go
they'll scream our names *

17:57.910 --> 18:01.914
* I guess that comes
with the price of fame *

18:01.948 --> 18:05.985
* Turn up the spotlights
we're on our way *

18:06.018 --> 18:09.889
* Turn up the spotlights
we wanna play *

18:09.922 --> 18:17.197
* We'll get it, I bet it were
gonna be stars one day *

18:21.000 --> 18:23.170
* S-U-N HI YA!

18:23.203 --> 18:24.871
* It's J-O-Di

18:24.904 --> 18:25.905
* Listen Up Corki

18:25.938 --> 18:27.907
* We'll be in the sky,
they'll see us glow *

18:27.940 --> 18:29.576
* Over the air
waves on the radio *

18:29.609 --> 18:31.911
* Just give us the lights
and we'll steal the show *

18:31.944 --> 18:33.980
* Throw your hands up
and then lose control *

18:34.013 --> 18:35.848
* Work everyday and all
through the night *

18:35.882 --> 18:37.450
* Only get one shot
better do it right *

18:37.484 --> 18:39.886
* Won't stop, till
everybody knows the name *

18:39.919 --> 18:42.889
* They better be ready
cause we'll bring the fame *

18:42.922 --> 18:46.993
* Turn up the spotlights we're
on our way (we're on our way) *

18:47.026 --> 18:50.663
* Turn up the spotlights we
wanna play (we wanna play) *

18:50.697 --> 18:59.038
* We'll get it, I bet it we're
gonna be stars one day *

18:59.071 --> 19:03.075
* Turn up the spotlights we're
on our way (we're on our way) *

19:03.109 --> 19:06.879
* Turn up the spotlights we
wanna play (we wanna play) *

19:06.913 --> 19:13.520
* We'll get it, I bet it we're
gonna be stars one day *

19:15.154 --> 19:16.823
(cheering)

19:16.856 --> 19:30.903
*

19:34.073 --> 19:36.209
(clapping)

19:36.609 --> 19:39.045
We could be so good.

19:39.078 --> 19:42.682
What are we talking
about here?

19:45.285 --> 19:48.588
A dance battle between
Scarecrow and Tin Wood Man?

19:48.621 --> 19:49.856
Seriously?

19:49.889 --> 19:51.624
I'll show you a
dance battle...

19:51.658 --> 19:54.327
You gonna show us
a dance battle?

19:54.361 --> 19:55.662
I would love to.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.129
Hey aren't you
Melwood Stark,

19:57.163 --> 19:59.999
king of dance at
MacKendrick prep?

20:00.032 --> 20:01.901
Guilty as charged.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.270
Mind showing
us a little?

20:03.303 --> 20:05.672
I live for it.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.807
But be warned, the
following dance

20:07.840 --> 20:10.610
contains moments
of awesomeness.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.913
Viewer discretion
is advised.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.118
Oh what's that.

20:20.320 --> 20:24.924
"We could be so good at being
the most awesome friends ever."

20:24.957 --> 20:26.759
Nice cover, Sun Hi.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.696
Except now my dad
thinks you're conceited.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.098
Aw, sweet.

20:32.131 --> 20:34.767
I can't believe we were
interviewed by DJ Maxwell.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.168
Totally unreal.

20:36.202 --> 20:37.604
It's just the beginning.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.872
Soon we'll be doing
television interviews,

20:39.906 --> 20:42.309
red carpet interviews, and those
interviews where they look back

20:42.342 --> 20:44.711
on your career and try
to make you cry.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.314
Those are going to be harder
to hide from my father.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.148
You're going to
have to tell him.

20:49.181 --> 20:51.918
Or, you can keep lying
for the rest of your life.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.886
For once, I agree
with Sun Hi.

20:53.920 --> 20:54.954
About time.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.055
It's uploaded.

20:56.656 --> 20:57.757
DJ Maxwell: Hey
what's up,

20:57.790 --> 20:59.926
it's DJ Maxwell here with
the Max Attack.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.329
Now earlier today I had the
privilege of meeting a

21:02.362 --> 21:03.430
hot new up-and-coming
band...

21:03.463 --> 21:04.731
These talented
young artists hail from

21:04.764 --> 21:07.867
The prestigious MacKendrick
Preparatory High School.

21:07.900 --> 21:08.801
Ahh.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.102
Oh.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.204
XO IQ is appearing tomorrow
night at Club Ry Ri --

21:12.238 --> 21:14.741
the coolest teen
space in the country

21:14.774 --> 21:17.109
according to DJ
Caleb Davis.

21:17.143 --> 21:19.346
So everyone
check that out.

21:19.379 --> 21:22.915
Alright so let's get
right to the interview.

21:23.249 --> 21:26.986
MacKendrick Prep's
best kept secret, XO IQ

21:27.019 --> 21:29.356
Are we ready
for stardom people?!

21:29.389 --> 21:31.090
Yeahhh!!!!

21:31.123 --> 21:33.159
Why don't you
introduce yourselves?
