03:11.753 --> 03:13.586
- Oh, the hurricane?
- Yeah.

03:13.655 --> 03:15.121
He has no idea.

03:15.190 --> 03:17.535
I didn't want to scare him with
the whole "we're being evacuated

03:17.559 --> 03:19.037
because of an apocalyptic
weather event" thing,

03:19.061 --> 03:20.193
so I just told him

03:20.262 --> 03:22.462
that Daddy wanted
some company

03:22.531 --> 03:24.697
and that you have
lots of snacks.

03:24.766 --> 03:25.698
Right, but those,
uh, are now rations,

03:25.767 --> 03:26.778

Hey! Take it easy!

03:28.336 --> 03:30.270
Hey, Grace called.

03:30.338 --> 03:31.938
She said it's 75
and sunny in L.A.,

03:32.007 --> 03:33.807

that she saw Kate Hudson

03:33.875 --> 03:35.308
walking out of
a smoothie shop.

03:35.377 --> 03:36.509
Oh, that's-that's good.

03:36.578 --> 03:38.812
Can Kate Hudson pick up the bill

03:38.880 --> 03:41.481
Well, at least our girl's
out of harm's way.

03:41.550 --> 03:43.628
Yeah, I know. Not so much
for my bank account though.

03:43.652 --> 03:45.163
Anyway, uh, you should
go deal with him.

03:45.187 --> 03:48.621

Um, why don't you
make yourself comfortable.

03:58.233 --> 04:00.400

gave the sun a eulogy,

04:20.021 --> 04:22.355

emergency services.

04:22.424 --> 04:24.457

04:33.301 --> 04:34.801

04:34.870 --> 04:36.714
that facilities is completely
overwhelmed right now,

04:36.738 --> 04:37.982
or that they wouldn't spring for

04:38.006 --> 04:39.472
flood doors
in the basement.

04:39.541 --> 04:41.975
Uh, you know why we don't have
flood doors down there, Jerry?

04:42.043 --> 04:44.355
Because apparently, from what
I've heard, it's never flooded.

04:44.379 --> 04:45.311
Never flooded!

04:45.380 --> 04:47.180

flooded yet.

this when I moved into

got a call from HPD.

05:13.742 --> 05:15.286
Uh, they're spread
pretty thin ever since

05:15.310 --> 05:17.277
the evacuation orders
have gone into effect,

05:17.345 --> 05:19.913
and they're requesting some
more bodies; they need help,

05:19.981 --> 05:22.126
so I'm gonna send you guys out
there, okay, give them a hand.

HPD's sending
two rescue vehicles.

splitting you guys up.

Agent Collins,
what can I do for you?

05:48.543 --> 05:50.176
Well, news of this
is still under wraps,

05:50.245 --> 05:52.178
but the Bureau
recently apprehended

05:52.247 --> 05:53.446
a high-level fugitive:

05:53.515 --> 05:55.081
Alejandro Vega.

05:55.150 --> 05:57.450
Ah, congratulations.
That's a big catch.

05:57.519 --> 05:58.851
Thank you.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.287
Problem is he was scheduled
to be transported to a supermax

06:01.356 --> 06:03.890
on the mainland today,
but because of the storm,

06:03.959 --> 06:05.158
all planes are grounded.

06:05.227 --> 06:06.359
Okay.

06:06.428 --> 06:07.838
I'm starting to get
the feeling, Agent,

06:07.862 --> 06:10.096
that this is, uh, a little more
than a courtesy call.

06:10.165 --> 06:12.065
Unfortunately, our safe house

06:12.133 --> 06:13.733
is in an evacuation zone.

06:13.802 --> 06:16.636
So, as of right now,
Five-O's rendition facility

06:16.705 --> 06:19.116
is the most secure place to hold
Vega until the weather clears.

06:19.140 --> 06:20.807
Okay, uh, Agent Collins,

06:20.875 --> 06:23.154

11:27.078 --> 11:28.678
for exactly
what you are:

11:28.747 --> 11:31.814
a sad and pathetic old man

11:31.883 --> 11:34.784
who's gonna spend the rest
of his life rotting in a cell.

11:45.597 --> 11:47.530
(indistinct chatter)

12:08.954 --> 12:10.553
(clears throat)

12:10.622 --> 12:12.922
Excuse me, sir.
I know you're busy,

12:12.991 --> 12:15.391
but is there something we
should be concerned about?

12:15.460 --> 12:17.071
There seems to be a lot
of security people around.

12:17.095 --> 12:19.028
Oh, no, it's just the usual
crowd control.

12:19.097 --> 12:21.331
Lots of people
in a confined space.

12:21.399 --> 12:22.932
Always good to be
prepared, am I right?

12:23.001 --> 12:24.801
Of course. Sorry to bother you.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.570
No problem.
You need a water?

12:27.639 --> 12:29.539
Thank you.

12:41.753 --> 12:43.686
TANI:
<i>Baby Joons.</i>

12:43.755 --> 12:44.687
How's it going?

12:44.756 --> 12:45.756
JUNIOR:
Ah, you know me,

12:45.790 --> 12:47.724
slow and steady. What about you?

12:47.792 --> 12:48.725
Set any land speed records yet?

12:48.793 --> 12:50.026
I don't even know

12:50.095 --> 12:51.105
if I'm driving on the right side

12:51.129 --> 12:52.295
of the street or not.

12:52.364 --> 12:54.230
Yeah, it's getting
pretty bad out there.

12:54.299 --> 12:55.698
Did you find anyone yet?

12:55.767 --> 12:57.433
Uh, a couple of stragglers.

12:57.502 --> 12:59.369
One person didn't have
a vehicle,

12:59.437 --> 13:01.282
the other one didn't even know
they were supposed to leave.

13:01.306 --> 13:02.450
Did they give you a hard time?

13:02.474 --> 13:03.773
Not really.

13:03.842 --> 13:05.119
I tell you what,
they were a lot easier

13:05.143 --> 13:06.542
than my pops was this morning.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.277
Wait, your parents
are in an evac zone?

13:08.346 --> 13:09.679
Yeah, right in the path.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.482
Mom and I had to convince Dad to
go down to the shelter with her.

13:12.550 --> 13:15.752
I'm telling you, Tani, this guy
never misses an opportunity

13:15.820 --> 13:17.420
to be stubborn about something.

13:17.489 --> 13:19.033
I'm so glad he didn't pass
that on to you.

13:19.057 --> 13:20.189
That would be terrible.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.991
(chuckles)

13:24.662 --> 13:25.762
(brakes screech)

13:27.932 --> 13:29.298
Joons, I got to call you back.

13:29.367 --> 13:30.933
I think I see a house
with people in it.

13:31.002 --> 13:32.935
Okay.

13:38.843 --> 13:39.942
(car lock beeps)

13:49.521 --> 13:52.255
Hi, I'm Officer Rey,
I'm with Five-O Task Force.

13:52.323 --> 13:54.323
Are you aware that you're
in an evacuation zone?

13:54.392 --> 13:56.893
I'm sorry,
do you mind if I come in?

13:56.961 --> 13:58.428
Y-Yeah, sure.

13:58.496 --> 14:00.630
Thank you. Okay...

14:00.698 --> 14:02.331
Ugh...

14:02.400 --> 14:03.966
JAMESON:
Hey, I'm Jameson.

14:04.035 --> 14:06.636
- This is my wife Shona.
- Hi.

14:06.704 --> 14:08.082
You do know
that you have to leave, right?

14:08.106 --> 14:09.350
The evacuations
are for your own safety.

14:09.374 --> 14:11.974
Right. Uh, but-but
we're fine.

14:12.043 --> 14:13.976
We're storm-proofing,
we have rations and...

14:14.045 --> 14:15.623
To be honest, there are
a ton of other people

14:15.647 --> 14:17.080
who need help evacuating.

14:17.148 --> 14:20.249
That's probably where you
should be focusing your efforts.

14:21.653 --> 14:24.620
Hi. Is that your,
is that your daughter?

14:26.458 --> 14:29.425
You should probably be
prioritizing her safety.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.127
So if you're not
willing to do that,

14:31.196 --> 14:32.929
I'm prepared to take
the appropriate steps

14:32.997 --> 14:34.464
to ensure that she's protected.

14:34.532 --> 14:36.365
What do you mean?

14:36.434 --> 14:39.268
The governor issued a mandatory
evacuation, so that means

14:39.337 --> 14:41.671
that I'm within my rights to
take both of you into custody.

14:41.739 --> 14:43.150
If that's the way
you'd like to play it,

14:43.174 --> 14:44.974
I'm willing to...
No, no, no. O-Okay.

14:45.043 --> 14:47.543
W-We got to be smart about
this, all right? She's right.

14:47.612 --> 14:49.045
C-Can I just get some valuables?

14:49.114 --> 14:51.114
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

14:53.084 --> 14:54.183
(laughs softly)

14:54.252 --> 14:55.551
I'm sorry.

14:55.620 --> 15:00.356
It's just... this storm
has really stressed us out.

15:00.425 --> 15:01.691
No, I-- I understand.

15:01.759 --> 15:03.926
Can I, can I help, in some way?

15:05.763 --> 15:08.965
Is that-- should I
grab her jacket?

15:13.371 --> 15:16.072
Sorry. No one's going anywhere.

15:16.141 --> 15:18.074
Including you.

15:22.147 --> 15:23.891
- Did you patch it?
DANNY: Yeah, I'm just happy

15:23.915 --> 15:25.195
the whole roof didn't blow away.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.682
Oh, no. Casualties?

15:26.751 --> 15:28.818
No, it should be all right.
Just a little damp.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.019
What's in them?

15:30.088 --> 15:31.365
I don't know.
I haven't been up here

15:31.389 --> 15:32.688
in a long time. Maybe gold bars.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.090
Okay, whatever's
in there,

15:34.159 --> 15:36.259
it will dry better
if we spread it out.

15:36.327 --> 15:38.261
Not if it's gold bars.

15:42.567 --> 15:45.501
What do you got?
Uh, it's,

15:45.570 --> 15:48.437
stuff that's...
- Some clothes and some shoes.

15:48.506 --> 15:50.072
Nice shoes. Now this,

15:50.141 --> 15:51.619
this is the box.
This is the good box.

15:51.643 --> 15:55.578
We've got CDs, books and
of course, deodorant.

15:55.647 --> 15:56.846
Right. In your attic.

15:56.915 --> 15:58.114
You are a strange man, Danny.

15:58.183 --> 15:59.448
Yeah, well,
I didn't know.

15:59.517 --> 16:01.557
I-- this is all stuff I
haven't seen in a long time.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.330
I didn't know what they'd have
here when I moved from Jersey...

16:03.354 --> 16:05.399
What, you didn't think that
they'd have deodorant in Hawaii?

16:05.423 --> 16:06.689
The-the brand, smart-ass.

16:06.758 --> 16:09.125
This is my, this is my
jam, back in the day.

16:09.194 --> 16:11.260
(inhales)
Mm. Smell that.

16:11.329 --> 16:14.230
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
Right?

16:14.299 --> 16:15.631
Danny, that's you,
when I met you.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.400
(laughs):
Oh, my God.

16:17.468 --> 16:19.569
Yeah.
That was when we were...

16:19.637 --> 16:21.370
Yeah. Mm.
(clears throat)

16:21.439 --> 16:24.040
Well, I had to wear this.
You made me very nervous.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.242
- Did I?
- You did. Yeah, I think, uh,

16:26.311 --> 16:29.979
on our second date, I pretty
much sweat through my T-shirt.

16:30.048 --> 16:31.414
That was a good night.

16:31.482 --> 16:34.550
- Good night.
- And if I remember correctly,

16:34.619 --> 16:38.254
I think that we sweated
for another reason that night.

16:38.323 --> 16:39.589
W-We did, yeah.

16:39.657 --> 16:41.657
We were bad that night.
No, we were good.

16:41.726 --> 16:43.859
Good. Very good, yeah.
Yeah, we were good.

16:45.063 --> 16:48.030
CHARLIE:
Mommy, Daddy, I'm hungry.

16:49.801 --> 16:50.833
You hungry?

16:50.902 --> 16:52.335
Starved.

16:52.403 --> 16:53.669
Good, good.

16:53.738 --> 16:56.939
I'll make you something to eat.
Okay.

16:57.008 --> 16:58.008
(Rachel laughs)

16:59.577 --> 17:01.777
All right. How we looking?

17:01.846 --> 17:04.180
Pretty good. We got agents
at every key access point

17:04.249 --> 17:06.327
on the Rendition floor, and
the room itself, once closed,

17:06.351 --> 17:08.851
is completely sealed.
STEVE: Good. I like it.

17:08.920 --> 17:13.856
Looks to me like, uh, Mr. Diablo
does not share your enthusiasm.

17:13.925 --> 17:16.592
Is anyone else
getting goose bumps?

17:16.661 --> 17:18.105
It's like he's staring
right into my soul.

17:18.128 --> 17:20.796
Would you stop with the
boogeyman thing, Jerry?

17:20.865 --> 17:22.164
It's just a guy,

17:22.233 --> 17:24.767
on his own,
sitting in a box.

17:24.836 --> 17:27.803
COLLINS:
No, he's right.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.283
Uh, Vega may not have
supernatural powers,

17:29.307 --> 17:32.808
but he does have a way
of getting ahold of people.

17:34.078 --> 17:36.579
I should know.

17:36.648 --> 17:39.315
I've been chasing him down
for ten years.

17:39.384 --> 17:41.384
That man cost me
everything I cared about.

17:41.452 --> 17:42.952
(mechanical clattering)

17:43.021 --> 17:45.421
- Oh.
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.

17:45.490 --> 17:46.900
Hold on, hold on. It's
probably just the storm.

17:46.924 --> 17:48.068
STEVE: Yeah, don't
panic. Adam's right.

17:48.092 --> 17:49.392
Backup generator

17:49.460 --> 17:51.494
should come on in a second.

17:51.562 --> 17:52.662
(whirring)

17:52.730 --> 17:53.829
All right, there we go.

17:55.233 --> 17:56.332
What's up
with the cameras?

17:56.401 --> 17:57.745
JERRY: Okay, those
cameras should be

17:57.769 --> 17:59.689
running off backup power,
but they're still down.

17:59.737 --> 18:01.037
Park,

18:01.105 --> 18:02.872
Lee, status update on Vega.

18:02.940 --> 18:04.140
Prisoner is secure.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.676
I'll see if I can restore
the cameras from here.

18:06.744 --> 18:08.477
Maybe if I reboot the system.

18:08.546 --> 18:09.990
JERRY: Yeah,
probably gonna have to do that

18:10.014 --> 18:11.814
from the main
server control room.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.983
Go down there, Jerry,
see what you can do.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.484
I'll go with.
Good.

18:15.553 --> 18:16.797
Uh, I'm gonna
go down to Rendition

18:16.821 --> 18:17.865
while the cameras are down.

18:17.889 --> 18:19.055
I want eyes on Vega myself.

18:19.123 --> 18:21.123
COLLINS:
Right there with you.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.160
Open it.
Do it.

18:27.465 --> 18:29.398
(door buzzes, latch clicks)

18:33.037 --> 18:35.137
Trouble with the power?

18:37.241 --> 18:38.841
Just lock it down, please.

18:44.182 --> 18:47.483
(door beeps, clicks)

18:47.552 --> 18:49.518
Hey, Jerry,
you get those cameras working?

18:49.587 --> 18:51.020
JERRY:
Negative, Commander,

18:51.089 --> 18:53.522
and they're not gonna be up
anytime soon.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.124
Someone did a real number here.

18:55.193 --> 18:58.394
Broke in and cut all the cables
to the NVR.

19:00.164 --> 19:01.630
- I got blood.
GROVER: What?

19:01.699 --> 19:03.799
STEVE: Guys, talk to me.
What's going on?

19:03.868 --> 19:05.434
GROVER: Steve,
we got a man down.

19:05.503 --> 19:08.070
It's a sheriff's deputy.

19:08.139 --> 19:09.505
He's got a weak pulse.

19:09.574 --> 19:11.374
Looks like he's been
either stabbed

19:11.442 --> 19:12.442
or shot.

19:12.510 --> 19:14.143
And there's more bad news.

19:14.212 --> 19:16.545
His service weapon's missing.

19:16.614 --> 19:19.715
Hang in there, buddy.
We're gonna get you some help.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.261
Given that El Diablo's broken
out of four prisons already?

19:21.285 --> 19:22.885
I'd say someone's trying
to make it five.

19:27.774 --> 19:29.107
STEVE:
<i>Clearly, this guy</i>

19:29.176 --> 19:30.887
came in with the evacuees.
I'm gonna need to borrow

19:30.911 --> 19:32.222
a couple of your
agents, all right?

19:32.246 --> 19:34.713
Conduct a floor-to-floor
search, help us find this guy.

19:34.781 --> 19:37.249
Harris, Jones, you'll be
assisting Commander McGarrett.

19:38.619 --> 19:40.752
- Hang in there, kiddo.
JERRY: Okay,

19:40.821 --> 19:42.131
I got the first aid kit
from my bunker,

19:42.155 --> 19:43.421
and I got WebMD up on my phone.

19:43.490 --> 19:46.191
What, are you kidding
me, Jerry? WebMD?

19:46.260 --> 19:47.926
Didn't you try to get
911 on the line?

19:47.995 --> 19:50.028
All circuits are busy.
This is the best we've got.

19:50.097 --> 19:53.098
Unless you already know the ten
steps to treating a stab wound.

19:53.166 --> 19:55.834
Ten? I only know the first one,
and that's stop the bleeding.

19:55.902 --> 19:57.969
You don't do that right,
the other nine are moot.

19:58.038 --> 20:00.972
Jerry, he's going into shock.
You got to hurry.

20:01.041 --> 20:03.642
Uh, okay.
Um, how's the bleeding,

20:03.710 --> 20:05.255
is it slow and steady,
or is it spurting?

20:05.279 --> 20:07.445
It's steady, but there's nothing
slow about it.

20:07.514 --> 20:09.492
Okay, where's the wound? Is it
between the ribs, or below?

20:09.516 --> 20:10.882
Below. Just below the ribcage.

20:10.951 --> 20:12.751
Okay, do you hear
any gurgling from his chest?

20:14.154 --> 20:17.322
No. Jerry, there's no gurgling,
just-just shallow breathing.

20:17.391 --> 20:20.225
Okay. So it seems the knife may
have missed any major organs,

20:20.294 --> 20:22.105
which means that we can keep him
stable for quite some time.

20:22.129 --> 20:23.969
That's good. You hear that?
You hear that, son?

20:23.997 --> 20:26.064
No vital organs, okay?

20:26.133 --> 20:28.433
You're gonna
be fine, okay?

20:28.502 --> 20:30.222
What's your name?
Can you tell me your name?

20:31.305 --> 20:33.538
Huh? Jerry,
you got to hurry, man.

20:34.908 --> 20:36.508
All right,

20:36.576 --> 20:39.444
so what we need to do is we need
to pack the wound with gauze.

20:39.513 --> 20:41.913
It's kind of like applying
pressure, but on the inside.

20:41.982 --> 20:43.126
That's better than the outside,

20:43.150 --> 20:44.294
'cause that's not doing
any good at all.

20:44.318 --> 20:46.351
H-Haku.
What?

20:46.420 --> 20:48.920
Hak-- did you say Haku?

20:48.989 --> 20:50.955
That's your name?
All right, Haku.

20:51.024 --> 20:52.457
I want you to
listen to me, okay?

20:52.526 --> 20:53.625
This is Jerry.

20:53.694 --> 20:55.126
All right? He's got
to do something

20:55.195 --> 20:57.028
to address this
wound of yours.

20:57.097 --> 20:58.975
Now, I'm not gonna lie to you,
son, you're gonna feel this.

20:58.999 --> 21:01.266
Okay? So just-just

21:01.335 --> 21:03.201
look at me. Keep
your focus on me.

21:03.270 --> 21:05.337
(screaming)
Okay. All right. All right.

21:05.405 --> 21:07.038
All right, steady,
steady, steady!

21:07.107 --> 21:10.642
Steady. I got you-- I got
something for you to focus on:

21:10.711 --> 21:13.445
that son of a bitch
that did this to you.

21:13.513 --> 21:14.924
That son of a bitch
that did this to you.

21:14.948 --> 21:16.314
Can you describe--
did you see him?

21:16.383 --> 21:17.860
- Did you get a good look at him?
- Yeah.

21:17.884 --> 21:20.819
Come on, son.
Hang in there, kid. Come on.

21:20.887 --> 21:23.021
Five ten.
Okay. All right.

21:23.090 --> 21:25.857
You're doing good. Good.
A-A slight build.

21:25.926 --> 21:28.860
A b-blue windbreaker.

21:28.929 --> 21:30.849
Blue windbreaker, okay.
You're doing-- all right.

21:30.897 --> 21:32.657
You're doing good.
Did this guy wear glasses?

21:33.967 --> 21:36.000
Holy crap,
I think I saw him.

21:36.069 --> 21:37.168
You need a water?

21:37.237 --> 21:38.870
Thank you.

21:38.939 --> 21:41.172
Jerry, we got to get
a description of this guy

21:41.241 --> 21:44.809
to McGarrett right now, before
this guy drops another body.

21:44.878 --> 21:47.712
Come on...
(screams)

22:02.028 --> 22:04.829
(wind howling)

22:04.898 --> 22:06.442
Now, don't you worry
about that noise, okay?

22:06.466 --> 22:07.466
It's just the wind.

22:09.770 --> 22:11.903
Buddy, you, uh, want me
to do one final sweep

22:11.972 --> 22:14.105
to make sure all the
monsters are gone or what?

22:14.174 --> 22:15.974
There's no such thing.

22:16.042 --> 22:17.675
That's true.
(chuckles)

22:17.744 --> 22:20.812
We'll be just out there
if you need anything, okay?

22:20.881 --> 22:22.380
Good night,
sweet boy.

22:22.449 --> 22:24.816
- Night.
DANNY: Good night, buddy.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.151
All right.

22:26.219 --> 22:29.120
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

22:29.189 --> 22:30.288
Close 'em.

22:30.357 --> 22:31.656
Keep 'em closed.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.391
That's it.

22:37.464 --> 22:38.630
Love you, buddy.
(door closes)

22:38.698 --> 22:39.798
Hey.

22:39.866 --> 22:42.000
He, uh, seems very
happy, doesn't he?

22:42.068 --> 22:43.768
Yeah. Why not?
He's got both of us here

22:43.837 --> 22:45.003
waiting on him hand and foot.

22:45.071 --> 22:46.304
That's true.

22:46.373 --> 22:48.351
Uh, I'm gonna get some blankets,
make up the couch.

22:48.375 --> 22:49.474
You can have the bed.

22:49.543 --> 22:52.277
Or...

22:56.550 --> 22:58.450
(Rachel laughing)
DANNY: Come on.

22:58.518 --> 23:00.618
Go. Roll. Go.

23:01.721 --> 23:03.988
Hey! Boom, that's
three of a kind.

23:04.057 --> 23:06.591
Whoa, whoa, that die
does not know what it is yet.

23:06.660 --> 23:08.226
What do you mean?
It's a six.

23:08.295 --> 23:09.994
What do you mean?
No, it's not a s...

23:10.063 --> 23:11.863
Well, it could be a six;
could be a two.

23:11.932 --> 23:12.932
It doesn't know yet.

23:12.999 --> 23:14.866
Oh, you want
to win like that?

23:14.935 --> 23:16.668
You gonna cheat?
(laughs) Do you know,

23:16.736 --> 23:18.269
I forgot what a sore
loser you are.

23:18.338 --> 23:19.982
What do you mean, a sore...?
I can't be a sore...

23:20.006 --> 23:21.105
I'm up three games to two.

23:21.174 --> 23:22.474
Yeah, not for long, bucko.

23:23.810 --> 23:25.410
(babbles mockingly)
(laughing)

23:25.479 --> 23:26.411
Come on.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.480
(wind howling)

23:33.019 --> 23:34.886
(phone beeps)

23:34.955 --> 23:36.120
Tani (recorded):
It's Tani.

23:36.189 --> 23:37.522
Sorry I can't pick up.

23:37.591 --> 23:39.057
It's not you; it's me.
(beeps)

23:39.125 --> 23:41.793
Hey, Tani, uh, it-it's getting
pretty dangerous out here.

23:41.862 --> 23:43.127
Uh, my-my sweep's done.

23:43.196 --> 23:44.496
I'm gonna head back to HQ,

23:44.564 --> 23:47.298
and I think
you should do the same.

23:47.367 --> 23:49.234
(phone beeps off)

23:50.770 --> 23:53.204
(indistinct arguing
in other room)

23:53.273 --> 23:55.673
SHONA: What the hell
are we going to do with her?

23:55.742 --> 23:57.308
I told you we
should have just left!

23:57.377 --> 23:58.788
JAMESON: Shut up! All right?
Just let me think.

23:58.812 --> 24:00.078
(door opens)

24:01.214 --> 24:03.481
Hi. Hi.

24:03.550 --> 24:04.649
I'm Tani.

24:04.718 --> 24:06.651
What's-what's your name?

24:06.720 --> 24:09.120
Emmy.
Emmy.

24:09.189 --> 24:11.122
That's such a cool name.

24:12.826 --> 24:15.126
My mommy said not
to talk to you.

24:15.195 --> 24:16.439
(loud, indistinct arguing
in other room)

24:16.463 --> 24:18.296
JAMESON:
Shut up! You're so stupid!

24:18.365 --> 24:20.164
I told you to stay away
from the window!

24:20.233 --> 24:22.166
Hey, you know what?

24:22.235 --> 24:24.636
I didn't like it
when my parents fought, either.

24:27.207 --> 24:29.140
Come here. Come closer.

24:31.912 --> 24:33.978
Emmy, does your...
does your daddy yell a lot?

24:35.382 --> 24:37.682
Maybe... sometimes.

24:37.751 --> 24:38.850
Yeah?

24:38.919 --> 24:40.451
Does he ever...

24:40.520 --> 24:41.953
Does he ever hurt your mommy?

24:46.326 --> 24:47.592
Wow.

24:47.661 --> 24:51.763
I love your
big-girl shoes.

24:51.831 --> 24:54.465
(gasps)
They're so cool.

24:54.534 --> 24:56.134
Laces are hard, right?

24:56.202 --> 25:00.505
My mommy tried to teach me,
but I'm no good at it.

25:00.574 --> 25:02.140
Are you kidding?

25:02.208 --> 25:05.109
I mean, I don't want
to brag or anything,

25:05.178 --> 25:07.478
but I'm-I'm amazing at it.

25:07.547 --> 25:08.780
I swear.

25:08.848 --> 25:10.682
I'm, like,
a world-class shoelace tier.

25:10.750 --> 25:12.150
I'm...

25:12.218 --> 25:13.685
I'm one of the best.

25:14.854 --> 25:16.788
Do you want me to show you?

25:22.128 --> 25:24.062
I'm guessing your search
didn't turn up our perp.

25:24.130 --> 25:26.564
No, not yet, but Collins' guys
are still out there looking.

25:26.633 --> 25:28.399
Your, uh, description
should help, though.

25:28.468 --> 25:31.169
Well, I might be close
on an actual ID.

25:31.237 --> 25:32.915
Now, the security cam
servers are still down,

25:32.939 --> 25:35.206
so I couldn't pull an image
of him from the lobby

25:35.275 --> 25:36.474
to run through
facial rec,

25:36.543 --> 25:38.710
but I did notice a
tattoo on his arm:

25:38.778 --> 25:40.178
a Day of the Dead skull.

25:40.246 --> 25:42.847
Which is not uncommon
among Central American cartels.

25:42.916 --> 25:44.549
However,

25:44.618 --> 25:47.085
crossing the FBI
tattoo database with CIU's

25:47.153 --> 25:50.054
organized crime record,
I got a short list.

25:50.123 --> 25:51.889
So, if he's done time...

25:54.427 --> 25:56.661
Booyah. Sergio Diaz.

25:56.730 --> 25:58.863
STEVE:
All right, good work, Jerry.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.409
At least now we know
who we're looking for.

26:00.433 --> 26:01.611
Send that photo
to Agent Harris.

26:01.635 --> 26:03.501
Have him distro
to the rest of my team.

26:03.570 --> 26:05.203
Done.
Hold on.

26:05.271 --> 26:06.549
According to his jacket,
this guy's

26:06.573 --> 26:08.117
a soldier for
the Cervantes organization.

26:08.141 --> 26:10.541
That's a rival cartel.

26:10.610 --> 26:12.410
JERRY: Why would one
of El Diablo's enemies

26:12.479 --> 26:13.811
want to bust him out?

26:13.880 --> 26:14.880
Unless...

26:14.948 --> 26:16.814
This guy's not here
to bust him out.

26:16.883 --> 26:18.249
He's here to kill him.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.587
You-you care to explain,
Agent Collins?

26:22.656 --> 26:24.166
Listen, I'm getting the
feeling that there's

26:24.190 --> 26:25.334
more to this
than you're telling us.

26:25.358 --> 26:26.924
You came to us
for help.

26:26.993 --> 26:28.393
Okay. Okay.
We can't help unless you

26:28.428 --> 26:30.072
tell us what's really going on.
- Okay, okay, okay.

26:30.096 --> 26:34.098
(sighs) Vega agreed
to turn state's evidence

26:34.167 --> 26:35.600
against his rivals.

26:36.803 --> 26:38.436
He was on his way
to the mainland

26:38.505 --> 26:39.937
to meet with
DOJ lawyers.

26:40.006 --> 26:41.617
Well, that would explain
the assassination attempt.

26:41.641 --> 26:44.409
Guy like Vega's got enough
information to put away

26:44.477 --> 26:45.743
a lot of high-level criminals.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.245
Yeah, it also explains
the urgency

26:47.313 --> 26:49.113
to do it before he gets
on that plane.

26:49.182 --> 26:50.982
We weren't supposed
to tell anyone--

26:51.051 --> 26:53.217
even you-- because...

26:53.286 --> 26:55.453
STEVE: Because you're
trying to prevent

26:55.522 --> 26:56.699
this exact thing from happening.

26:56.723 --> 26:58.623
Look, you had your orders.
I get it, okay?

26:58.692 --> 27:01.125
And, frankly, I feel a little
better babysitting this scumbag

27:01.194 --> 27:02.605
knowing that he's actually
gonna help us

27:02.629 --> 27:04.629
put away a whole bunch
of people just like him.

27:04.698 --> 27:06.898
COLLINS:
Now all we have to do

27:06.966 --> 27:08.099
is keep him alive.

27:08.168 --> 27:10.001
That's all.

27:10.070 --> 27:12.003
♪ ♪

27:42.102 --> 27:44.035
♪ ♪

27:44.104 --> 27:46.037
(engine rumbling)

27:58.351 --> 28:00.284
(coughing)

28:08.261 --> 28:09.527
Help me!

28:11.598 --> 28:12.897
Help!

28:12.966 --> 28:14.432
(coughing)

28:14.501 --> 28:15.666
Help me...

28:17.971 --> 28:19.237
(coughing)

28:23.994 --> 28:26.361
All right, guys,
we got to lock down that lobby,

28:26.429 --> 28:27.695
sequester all the evacuees.

28:27.764 --> 28:28.997
Make sure that assassin's

28:29.065 --> 28:30.798
not hiding down there
somewhere with them.

28:30.867 --> 28:31.867
Will do.

28:31.935 --> 28:33.601
And we got to go
floor to floor again,

28:33.670 --> 28:34.936
but this time with more men.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.315
What do you mean,
he's not answering?

28:36.339 --> 28:37.605
Find him.

28:37.674 --> 28:38.666
Whoa, wait a sec.
What was that about?

28:38.667 --> 28:41.109
Mercer. He's not at his post.
Where was he stationed?

28:41.177 --> 28:43.945
Near the loading bay,
where we first came in.

28:44.014 --> 28:46.414
That's right under Rendition.

28:49.352 --> 28:52.453
Heads up. Heads up.

28:52.522 --> 28:54.722
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

28:54.791 --> 28:56.391
(exhales sharply)

28:56.459 --> 28:58.426
Close this door after us.

29:01.464 --> 29:04.832
(Steve and Collins
gasping, coughing)

29:17.047 --> 29:18.813
(lock buzzes)
(banging on door)

29:18.882 --> 29:20.815
(coughing continues)

29:20.884 --> 29:22.316
Shut the door.

29:23.420 --> 29:25.219
(door closes)

29:25.288 --> 29:27.488
(grunts) Set him down now.

29:29.993 --> 29:31.793
No pulse.

29:35.131 --> 29:37.698
(exhales)

29:37.767 --> 29:39.901
(coughing)
Sit him up.

29:39.969 --> 29:41.969
Let's get him up.

29:43.073 --> 29:44.439
What's our move, sir?

29:44.507 --> 29:46.052
Well, we can't leave him
sitting out here.

29:46.076 --> 29:47.175
He's completely exposed.

29:47.243 --> 29:48.609
Can't put him back
in Rendition.

29:48.678 --> 29:50.198
We got to find
another secure location.

29:51.948 --> 29:54.048
All right,
we'll take him up to HQ.

29:54.117 --> 29:55.783
Lock him in
my office.

29:55.852 --> 29:58.097
From there, we have clear fields
of vision to all access points.

29:58.121 --> 29:59.265
All right?
It's our best option.

29:59.289 --> 30:02.023
Harris, secure the building.

30:02.092 --> 30:03.791
Report to higher.
Let's go.

30:03.860 --> 30:06.027
How's he doing?

30:06.096 --> 30:09.230
The bleeding has slowed
substantially, but, um...

30:11.234 --> 30:12.633
...his pulse is weak.

30:12.702 --> 30:14.068
Very weak.

30:14.137 --> 30:15.536
That's not good.

30:15.605 --> 30:16.871
Weak pulse means

30:16.940 --> 30:18.639
that there's less blood pump...
- Jerry...

30:18.708 --> 30:20.208
it means he's gonna be fine.

30:20.276 --> 30:21.943
You hear me?

30:22.011 --> 30:23.511
You're gonna be fine, Haku.

30:23.580 --> 30:26.814
Haku. You'll be fine as long
as you keep looking at me.

30:26.883 --> 30:28.683
Keep your eyes
open, now. Come on.

30:28.751 --> 30:31.018
So tired.
I know.

30:31.087 --> 30:33.087
Just want to sleep.
Sleep? Come on, now.

30:33.156 --> 30:34.755
What you want to
go to sleep for?

30:34.824 --> 30:36.302
We're just getting
to know each other.

30:36.326 --> 30:39.293
How long you been
at this job, anyway?

30:39.362 --> 30:40.761
Three months.

30:40.830 --> 30:43.764
I remember when I
first started out--

30:43.833 --> 30:45.733
young rookie
looking for action,

30:45.802 --> 30:47.835
just trying
to make my rep

30:47.904 --> 30:50.271
so I could get in good
with the fellas.

30:50.340 --> 30:52.173
Maybe get myself
a cool nickname.

30:52.242 --> 30:54.142
They give you
a nickname yet?

30:54.210 --> 30:55.776
No.

30:55.845 --> 30:57.178
I got mine real early.

30:57.247 --> 30:59.347
I'll tell you
this story.

30:59.415 --> 31:01.349
When I was a rookie--

31:01.417 --> 31:04.919
about, I don't know,
three, four months in--

31:04.988 --> 31:07.588
they sent five of us out
to an abandoned

31:07.657 --> 31:11.859
apartment building to
clear it of squatters.

31:11.928 --> 31:13.728
It was pretty routine--
five of us going in.

31:13.796 --> 31:15.062
We started looking for 'em.

31:15.131 --> 31:16.297
All of a sudden, pop!

31:16.366 --> 31:17.999
Pop, pop, pop!

31:18.067 --> 31:20.334
Yeah, yeah, that woke you up,
didn't it?

31:20.403 --> 31:22.470
That's right,
they were shooting at us.

31:22.539 --> 31:24.105
Man, I ducked
behind something

31:24.174 --> 31:25.673
to get myself
some cover.

31:25.742 --> 31:28.220
I must have been all hopped up
on adrenaline or something, man,

31:28.244 --> 31:30.244
'cause I didn't even feel it
when I got shot.

31:31.447 --> 31:33.681
Only thing I could feel was,

31:33.750 --> 31:35.650
well, the blood
running down my leg.

31:35.718 --> 31:37.151
Whoa.

31:37.220 --> 31:39.987
Yeah.
How-how... how bad was it?

31:40.056 --> 31:41.923
Well, that's the thing.

31:41.991 --> 31:44.125
I-I must have been
going into shock.

31:44.194 --> 31:45.993
I couldn't even feel the wound.

31:46.062 --> 31:47.995
Yeah, I was scared, man.

31:48.064 --> 31:50.631
I was scared just like
you're scared right now.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.133
Fearing the worst.

31:52.202 --> 31:53.467
Where were you shot?

31:55.238 --> 31:58.005
Well, see, that's-that's...
that's-that's the thing.

31:58.074 --> 32:00.141
Um...

32:00.210 --> 32:02.343
I-I wasn't shot.

32:02.412 --> 32:04.378
And the blood

32:04.447 --> 32:07.148
going down my leg...

32:07.217 --> 32:08.849
Well, I...

32:10.353 --> 32:11.586
...wet my pants.

32:11.654 --> 32:13.888

Stop. Stop, okay?

32:16.759 --> 32:17.803
You're gonna hurt yourself.

32:17.827 --> 32:19.727
I know it hurts.
Stop-stop laughing.

32:19.796 --> 32:21.195
Stop laughing.

32:21.264 --> 32:23.631
That was... that's how
I got my nickname.

32:24.734 --> 32:26.267

Stop moving.
Stop moving.

Listen to me.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.245
I know you want to
get out of here

32:59.269 --> 33:00.434

help you, okay?

33:00.503 --> 33:01.936
But you got to
help me first.

33:02.005 --> 33:03.137
Do you understand?

33:03.206 --> 33:05.673
I need you to tell me
where you put my gun.

33:05.742 --> 33:07.441
And then, when
I get my gun,

33:07.510 --> 33:10.444
I am gonna take you and Emmy,
and we're gonna get out of here.

33:10.513 --> 33:12.613
Okay? Is that
what you want?

33:12.682 --> 33:14.382
Is that what
you want? Okay.

33:14.450 --> 33:16.095

I'm gonna take my hand

you're not gonna make a sound.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.840
Get back. Stop right there.

33:39.909 --> 33:42.810
Both of you. Here's what's
gonna happen right now.

33:42.879 --> 33:44.912
We're all gonna take a breath,

and then I'm gonna take
the three of you into custody.

33:47.483 --> 33:49.450

what I'm saying?

33:49.519 --> 33:51.385
This is over now.

34:18.748 --> 34:22.149
How did Diaz know to
infiltrate 'Iolani Palace?

34:22.217 --> 34:24.251
He's probably been tracking us
for a while.

34:24.320 --> 34:26.286

to strike.

could he have known that?
