21:23.400 --> 21:25.700
MORGAN, HONEY,
PUT YOUR TEA SET AWAY

21:25.700 --> 21:26.834
AND BRUSH YOUR TEETH.

21:26.834 --> 21:28.133
IT'S TIME TO GO
TO BED.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.500
DO I HAVE TO?

21:31.500 --> 21:32.700

21:34.500 --> 21:36.500

21:42.000 --> 21:43.233
WHY?

21:43.233 --> 21:44.967
'CAUSE I DON'T
UNDERSTAND ANYTHING

21:44.967 --> 21:46.734
ABOUT MY ENTIRE LIFE.

21:55.500 --> 21:56.567
YEAH, THANKS.

22:05.834 --> 22:07.500
TWO DAYS IN A ROW.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.033

DOESN'T LEARN.

22:10.033 --> 22:12.033
EVELYN, I HOPE
I'M NOT BEING FORWARD,

22:12.033 --> 22:14.100
BUT INSTEAD
OF CAFETERIA LUNCH,

22:14.100 --> 22:16.800

HAVE DINNER TOGETHER?

22:16.800 --> 22:19.500
OF COURSE, GEORGE.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.600
I'D LOVE IT.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.000
