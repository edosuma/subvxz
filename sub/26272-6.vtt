09:31.571 --> 09:33.921
Post hoc, ergo, propter hoc?

09:33.964 --> 09:36.924
After this, therefore,
because of this.

09:36.967 --> 09:38.621
That's the
prosecution's theory.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.884
The fire and JC's
subsequent death

09:40.928 --> 09:43.191
happened after a series
of negligent behaviors

09:43.234 --> 09:45.149
on Greg's part:
the fire code violation,

09:45.193 --> 09:46.716
the OSHA citation,
the grease buildup.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.849
I would argue the same thing.

09:48.892 --> 09:51.678
But post hoc is actually
a logical fallacy.

09:51.721 --> 09:54.898
It basically means that
correlation equals causation,

09:54.942 --> 09:56.117
which it doesn't.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.727
Just because there's
a relationship

09:57.771 --> 09:59.642
between two events doesn't mean
one event caused the other.

09:59.686 --> 10:02.776
So, to answer
your question,

10:02.819 --> 10:04.647
we need people
who understand that.

10:04.691 --> 10:07.911
We need people who see
that correlation

10:07.955 --> 10:09.434
doesn't always equal causation.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.349
And how do I go about that?

10:12.786 --> 10:14.004
Good morning.

10:14.048 --> 10:16.572
So it says here on
your jury questionnaire

10:16.616 --> 10:18.139
that you played
semipro football.

10:18.182 --> 10:20.141

10:24.711 --> 10:26.147
that there is
a direct correlation

10:26.190 --> 10:28.715
between the number of
sports drinks a person consumes

10:28.758 --> 10:30.717
and the increased likelihood

10:30.760 --> 10:32.762
of that person
getting a knee injury?

10:32.806 --> 10:35.547
I would say your logic
is faulty,

10:35.591 --> 10:37.506
but your conclusion is sound.

10:37.549 --> 10:38.986
How so?I mean,

10:39.029 --> 10:40.552
it makes sense.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.076
People who drink
a lot of sports drinks

10:42.119 --> 10:44.034
are more likely to be athletes.

10:44.078 --> 10:46.254
Athletes are more likely
to get injured.

10:46.297 --> 10:49.170
But sports drinks
don't cause knee injuries.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.696
This juror is acceptable
to the defense, Your Honor.

10:55.306 --> 10:58.527
Mr. Watson. You are a high
school history teacher.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.834
That's correct.So let me ask
you a question.

11:00.877 --> 11:03.880
Are you aware
that in World War I,

11:03.924 --> 11:06.448
the British wore steel helmets
for the first time?

11:06.491 --> 11:08.276
I'm vaguely aware of that.

11:08.319 --> 11:11.758
So would it surprise you to hear
that the rate of head injuries

11:11.801 --> 11:14.630
went up, not down?

11:14.674 --> 11:16.937
Do you have
any explanation for that?

11:16.980 --> 11:19.548
I can offer an educated guess.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.942
I mean, it makes sense,
having all that metal

11:21.985 --> 11:23.291
clanking around on your head,

11:23.334 --> 11:24.901
it's bound
to bang you up.

11:24.945 --> 11:26.511
Interesting theory.

11:26.555 --> 11:28.949
But wrong. The steel helmets
actually kept more men alive

11:28.992 --> 11:30.602
that otherwise would have died.

11:30.646 --> 11:32.648
True, they had head injuries,
but at least

11:32.692 --> 11:34.911
they were still breathing.

11:34.955 --> 11:37.479
Taylor, give me a reason
to keep this guy.

11:37.522 --> 11:39.133
I don't think there is one.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.007
We'd like to thank and excuse
this juror, Your Honor.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.009
Then the defense
is out of challenges.

11:46.053 --> 11:49.796
Is this panel acceptable
to the prosecution?

11:49.839 --> 11:51.406
It is, Your Honor.

11:51.449 --> 11:53.800
Then we have our jury.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.628
I was hoping
for a stronger start, Bull.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.456
By my count, at least eight
of these jurors

11:58.500 --> 12:00.371
are susceptible
to logical fallacies.

12:00.415 --> 12:01.764
That means a third aren't.

12:01.808 --> 12:04.941
That's not bad. We can
work with a third.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.955
Got a sec?Oh, sorry.

12:18.999 --> 12:22.045
You scared me.
Um, you heading home?

12:22.089 --> 12:24.047
Yeah, in a minute.

12:24.091 --> 12:26.397
While you were in court,
Taylor and I went through

12:26.441 --> 12:29.270
all the paperwork for all
of Greg's restaurants,

12:29.313 --> 12:33.709
and we found something
I wanted you to see.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.667
What exactly am I looking at?

12:35.711 --> 12:39.367
Did you know that Greg
only had six weeks

12:39.410 --> 12:41.978
to pay his investors $2 million

12:42.022 --> 12:45.634
or he'd lose the controlling
stake in his restaurant group?

12:52.075 --> 12:54.034
Mind if I join?

12:57.689 --> 13:01.041
I think my husband owes
millions of dollars

13:01.084 --> 13:03.086
he's never told me about.

13:05.132 --> 13:06.350
[elevator bell chimes]

13:09.832 --> 13:12.574
BULL:
You know,

13:12.617 --> 13:15.838
debt's a funny word.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.188
One man's debt is another
man's working capital.

13:18.232 --> 13:19.842
You know what I mean?

13:19.886 --> 13:21.844
I just know what I read.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.541
Danny showed me
some promissory notes.

13:23.585 --> 13:26.980
Apparently, he is two weeks away
from losing everything.

13:27.023 --> 13:29.156
If he doesn't pay,

13:29.199 --> 13:31.071
which the promissory note
wouldn't have shown you.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.119
Are we having a conversation
about Greg,

13:36.163 --> 13:38.600
or the last great love
of your life, Kyle?

13:38.643 --> 13:42.082
I sure can pick them, can't I?

13:42.125 --> 13:45.346
Listen, I don't mean
to crash your pity party,

13:45.389 --> 13:48.871
but I think you might be
rushing to judgment here.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.874
But why wouldn't he tell me?

13:51.918 --> 13:55.095
I have no idea.

13:56.574 --> 13:59.926
Here's a crazy
thought: ask him.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.712
Taxi!

14:07.150 --> 14:09.196
He's not Kyle.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.938
[car door closes]

14:20.903 --> 14:22.035
ANDERSON: Based
on our investigation,

14:22.078 --> 14:23.950
this fire
and the subsequent explosion

14:23.993 --> 14:26.691
were the result of a grease
buildup, a faulty vent

14:26.735 --> 14:30.304
and the haphazard storage of
cleaning products and solvents.

14:30.347 --> 14:32.872
Correct me if I'm wrong,
Fire Marshal Anderson,

14:32.915 --> 14:34.656
but isn't all of that
preventable?

14:34.699 --> 14:37.267
Yes. The City of New York
has rules and regulations

14:37.311 --> 14:39.835
to prevent incidents like this
from happening.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.970
So is it fair to say
that JC Morales's death

14:44.013 --> 14:46.102
is a direct result
of the defendant

14:46.146 --> 14:47.756
disregarding those regulations?

14:47.799 --> 14:49.932
You could say that, yes.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.630
Thank you. No further questions.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.851
BENNY:
Good morning,

14:55.895 --> 14:57.418
Fire Marshal Anderson.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.202
Really appreciate
your testimony.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.204
The thing is...
[sighs]

15:01.248 --> 15:03.511
I've been through your report
a dozen times,

15:03.554 --> 15:05.992
and there's something
that's been bothering me.

15:06.035 --> 15:10.344
I see no mention of what
actually ignited the grease

15:10.387 --> 15:12.868
and started the fire
in the first place.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.522
ANDERSON:
Well, given the severity

15:14.565 --> 15:16.698
of the damage,
that's impossible to determine.

15:16.741 --> 15:19.527
Yes, but given
your 35 years of experience,

15:19.570 --> 15:21.311
I imagine you have a theory.

15:21.355 --> 15:23.052
Objection.
Calls for speculation.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.488
A professional opinion

15:24.532 --> 15:27.100
is not the same
as speculation, Ms. Drake.

15:27.143 --> 15:30.277
You may answer
the question.

15:30.320 --> 15:33.280
Uh, most likely, some kind
of particulate matter got in

15:33.323 --> 15:37.066
through the vent and heated over
time to the point of ignition.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.502
That's interesting.

15:38.546 --> 15:42.028
Now, when you say
"particulate matter,"

15:42.071 --> 15:46.249
you're basically saying anything
that burns and is small enough

15:46.293 --> 15:49.687
to have gotten up
into that vent, right?

15:49.731 --> 15:52.212
I mean, it could be a
small piece of paper,

15:52.255 --> 15:55.389
an onion skin,
the lint from somebody's pocket,

15:55.432 --> 15:57.957
a cigarette ash?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.481
It's certainly possible, though
there's no evidence to suggest

16:00.524 --> 16:02.613
any of those items
were involved.

16:02.657 --> 16:07.009
What if I told you
that the deceased Mr. Morales

16:07.053 --> 16:10.665
had a history of smoking inside
the restaurant after hours?

16:10.708 --> 16:13.059
Objection. No foundation.

16:13.102 --> 16:14.843
Your Honor,
we'd like to enter into evidence

16:14.886 --> 16:18.890
a report from JC Morales's
personnel file.

16:18.934 --> 16:21.023
An opening manager had

16:21.067 --> 16:24.070
written him up after finding
cigarette butts he had left

16:24.113 --> 16:26.159
when cleaning
the night before.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.946
So...

16:30.990 --> 16:34.906
if Mr. Morales had been
smoking inside

16:34.950 --> 16:37.083
the night of the fire,

16:37.126 --> 16:38.736
wouldn't you say
it would've

16:38.780 --> 16:42.436
been possible for him to have
inadvertently started the fire?

16:42.479 --> 16:46.048
Yes. If that was the case,
it's certainly possible

16:46.092 --> 16:48.398
he may have started
the ignition.

16:48.442 --> 16:50.487
[gallery murmuring]Thank you.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.141
No further questions,
Your Honor.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.102
TAYLOR:
Good news for our team.

16:56.145 --> 16:57.668
Starting to see
a little burst of green.

16:59.322 --> 17:01.237
We'd like to redirect,
Your Honor.

17:01.281 --> 17:02.760
Go ahead.

17:02.804 --> 17:05.198
DRAKE:
So, Fire Marshal Anderson,

17:05.241 --> 17:08.288
regardless if the fire was
ignited by a cigarette

17:08.331 --> 17:09.680
or any number of other things

17:09.724 --> 17:11.073
that could have gotten through
that faulty vent,

17:11.117 --> 17:12.901
were it not
for the grease buildup

17:12.944 --> 17:14.294
and the improperly
stored chemicals,

17:14.337 --> 17:16.774
wouldn't Mr. Morales
still be alive?

17:18.167 --> 17:20.126
No accelerant, no explosion.

17:20.169 --> 17:22.215
So yes, I believe he would.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.304
[gallery murmuring]

17:24.347 --> 17:26.567
Thank you. No further questions.

17:35.315 --> 17:36.968
You Michael Davis?

17:37.012 --> 17:39.667
Cesar Caputo. Who wants to know?

17:39.710 --> 17:41.103
My name is Danny James.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.236
I'm working on Greg Valerian's
defense team.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.847
Investigating
the Briarcrest Room fire?

17:45.890 --> 17:48.197
I have an inspection
report here saying

17:48.241 --> 17:50.069
that the restaurant's
exhaust vents were cleaned

17:50.112 --> 17:51.809
by this company two months ago.

17:51.853 --> 17:53.942
I'm looking for the guy
that signed it, Michael Davis.

17:53.985 --> 17:55.987
Yeah, well...
[chuckles]

17:56.031 --> 17:57.902
if you find him,
tell him I want my tools back.

17:57.946 --> 18:00.557
He's not here?He's not here.
He's not anywhere.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.081
Hey.

18:02.124 --> 18:06.215
This is your company,
right, Mr. Caputo?

18:06.259 --> 18:07.956
Can you explain to me
how there could have been

18:07.999 --> 18:09.697
five months of grease
in those vents,

18:09.740 --> 18:11.829
if this guy Davis did
what he said he did?

18:11.873 --> 18:15.006
Well, I think you just answered
your own question, didn't you?

18:15.050 --> 18:17.661
Look, 80% of our guys

18:17.705 --> 18:19.924
have been here since
they graduated high school.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.709
They're grateful for the job,

18:21.752 --> 18:24.581
and they take
the responsibility seriously.

18:24.625 --> 18:28.411
But the other 20?
It's like a revolving door.

18:28.455 --> 18:30.370
Nobody dreams
of crawling through

18:30.413 --> 18:32.372
greasy ducts for a living,

18:32.415 --> 18:35.375
spending all day
breathing in solvents.

18:35.418 --> 18:38.160
It doesn't matter
how much you pay them.

18:38.204 --> 18:42.121
'Cause sometimes they can make
more for not doing the job.

18:42.164 --> 18:43.992
All right?
Guy owns a restaurant,

18:44.035 --> 18:46.603
he needs the kitchen that
morning for a catering job,

18:46.647 --> 18:48.605
or simply can't be bothered

18:48.649 --> 18:50.172
having somebody
that'll let us in.

18:50.216 --> 18:53.088
Now, mind you,
I have no idea what happened.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.830
Davis is long gone,
I can't find him.

18:55.873 --> 18:58.006
For all I know, he did
what he was supposed to do

18:58.049 --> 19:00.574
and that's why
he signed the paper.

19:00.617 --> 19:03.403
And by the way,

19:03.446 --> 19:06.928
you call me into court,
that's what I'm gonna say.

19:06.971 --> 19:10.061
DANNY: He claims
he doesn't know anything.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.759
But he did
strongly imply

19:11.802 --> 19:13.108
that if those ducts
weren't clean,

19:13.152 --> 19:15.589
it's because Greg
didn't want them cleaned.

19:16.764 --> 19:19.723
Oh. Sorry I'm late.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.725
Didn't realize
we were having a meeting.

19:23.379 --> 19:26.339
Nothing important.
Just the usual postmortem.

19:26.382 --> 19:29.516
You really don't
need to be here.

19:29.559 --> 19:33.084
In fact, aren't
there other places,

19:33.128 --> 19:36.914
other people,
it would make more sense for you

19:36.958 --> 19:38.699
to be spending time with?

19:38.742 --> 19:42.616
I think that's for me to decide.

19:44.357 --> 19:48.274
Don't forget, I actually have
two dogs in this fight.

19:48.317 --> 19:52.147
My husband, and TAC.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.976
I may lose one.
I am not gonna lose both.

19:56.804 --> 19:59.415
Now why wouldn't Greg want
those ducts cleaned?

19:59.459 --> 20:01.417
Nobody knows anything.

20:01.461 --> 20:04.333
These are just
theories. Marissa...

20:04.377 --> 20:05.508
I might know.

20:07.075 --> 20:10.383
Greg's fire insurance policy.

20:10.426 --> 20:14.996
It would have given him more
than enough to cover his debts.

20:15.039 --> 20:19.653
Marissa, we all know
how hard this is for you.

20:19.696 --> 20:23.265
How tempting it is
to get ahead of it,

20:23.309 --> 20:25.441
assume the worst.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.443
That way,
the world won't let you down.

20:27.487 --> 20:31.447
That way, the ones you love
won't wound you

20:31.491 --> 20:32.883
because you've already
wounded yourself,

20:32.927 --> 20:36.235
and there's no blood
left to bleed.

20:38.193 --> 20:40.978
But the simple
truth is,

20:41.022 --> 20:44.982
there is absolutely no evidence
that this fire was intentional.

20:45.026 --> 20:48.682
Not even the prosecutor
is claiming it was arson.

20:48.725 --> 20:53.034
Okay. You're right.

20:53.077 --> 20:55.254
But there's something else.

20:57.081 --> 21:00.476
Something else I haven't
shared with any of you.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.087
Okay.

21:06.047 --> 21:07.831
Greg and I have this thing.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.180
It's a ritual.

21:09.224 --> 21:12.183
Sort of a promise
we made to each other.

21:12.227 --> 21:15.012
If I'm asleep
when he gets home from work,

21:15.056 --> 21:16.840
he wakes me up and kisses me.

21:16.884 --> 21:18.320
And if he's asleep
when I get home--

21:18.364 --> 21:20.104
you get the idea.

21:20.148 --> 21:21.671
And you're mentioning it
because...?

21:21.715 --> 21:23.107
Because we've been
doing it every night

21:23.151 --> 21:24.718
since we got back together.

21:24.761 --> 21:28.330
Every night, one of us gets home
later than the other.

21:28.374 --> 21:33.117
Every night,
except the night of the fire.

21:33.161 --> 21:36.164
The night of the fire,
he didn't wake me up.

21:36.207 --> 21:38.297
It's the only time

21:38.340 --> 21:40.299
and I cannot help but wonder,

21:40.342 --> 21:43.780
is it because he wasn't at home
when he should've been?

21:43.824 --> 21:48.219
And if he wasn't, where was he?

21:51.005 --> 21:52.180
Thanks, Benny.

21:52.223 --> 21:54.182
Danny.

21:54.225 --> 21:57.446
See you in court.

21:57.490 --> 22:00.188
You know where to find me.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.889
I apologize if I seem dramatic.

22:05.933 --> 22:08.805
Just...

22:08.849 --> 22:12.635
a man lost his life.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.942
I'm hoping it's
a terrible accident,

22:14.985 --> 22:19.599
but it's possible it wasn't.

22:19.642 --> 22:23.907
And I need to know.

22:23.951 --> 22:26.910
I need to know who I married.

22:32.002 --> 22:34.222
Want to share a cab?

22:38.879 --> 22:42.839
Look, the fire science
can be subjective.

22:42.883 --> 22:46.103
There's always room
for interpretation.

22:46.147 --> 22:49.672
I know someone, an arson expert
with top-of-the-line equipment.

22:49.716 --> 22:53.154
Like me to
give her a call?

22:53.197 --> 22:54.851
Might put your mind
at ease.

22:54.895 --> 22:57.288
I wouldn't mind having
a second opinion.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.427
I'm a terrible wife.

23:08.299 --> 23:11.955
[crying]:
I should just trust, right?

23:15.263 --> 23:17.483
You're asking the Helen Keller
of marriage

23:17.526 --> 23:19.615
whether or not he likes
the color of your dress.

23:19.659 --> 23:22.618
[laughs]

23:24.794 --> 23:27.754
You are who you are.

23:27.797 --> 23:30.017
You can only do what you can do.

23:32.062 --> 23:35.805
You can only be
who you can be.

23:35.849 --> 23:39.156
Dr. Bull,
Chef Hansen.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.201
Just finished
a little witness prep

23:40.244 --> 23:41.507
and I believe
he's good to go.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.247
Thanks for doing this, Chef.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.554
Happy to. Greg's my boy.
Anything I can do to help.

23:45.598 --> 23:46.990
Well, not much to it.

23:47.034 --> 23:49.689
Just need you to testify
to Greg's safety policies

23:49.732 --> 23:51.125
and character
as a business owner.

23:51.168 --> 23:52.692
No problem.

23:52.735 --> 23:55.129
Do you think I have a little
time before you guys need me?

23:55.172 --> 23:57.871
I'd love to go outside
and maybe walk a mile or so.

23:57.914 --> 23:59.525
Trying to get my steps in.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.178
[phone vibrates]The girlfriend worries
about my love affair

24:01.222 --> 24:04.268
with butter and sugar and cream.
Checks the count every night.

24:04.312 --> 24:06.967
[laughs] Yeah.
No girlfriend,

24:07.010 --> 24:10.666
but, uh, I count steps now, too.

24:10.710 --> 24:12.363
Steps are gonna have to wait.
Benny says it's go time.

24:12.407 --> 24:14.670
Let's do it.

24:14.714 --> 24:16.193
Now the prosecution has been
trying to paint Greg

24:16.237 --> 24:18.892
as a negligent boss.

24:18.935 --> 24:21.242
A guy who doesn't like
to follow the rules.

24:21.285 --> 24:24.419
Now, you worked for him
for eight years.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.029
Now what's your
impression of him?

24:26.073 --> 24:28.945
My impression?

24:28.989 --> 24:31.339
The Briarcrest Room is the
best place I've ever worked.

24:31.382 --> 24:35.735
Probably the best place
I ever will work.

24:35.778 --> 24:36.866
Why is that?

24:36.910 --> 24:38.738
[sighs]

24:38.781 --> 24:40.391
A lot of restaurant owners
in this city

24:40.435 --> 24:43.351
only care about status
and their bottom line.

24:43.394 --> 24:44.744
Greg is not that guy.

24:44.787 --> 24:47.181
He understands
the business.

24:47.224 --> 24:49.705
He cares about his product
and his customers.

24:49.749 --> 24:52.969
He cares about his employees
and their futures, their lives.

24:53.013 --> 24:54.667
He made me
business partner

24:54.710 --> 24:56.930
after six years
of working together.

24:56.973 --> 24:59.498
Told me I was such
a valuable member of the team,

24:59.541 --> 25:02.152
he couldn't bear
the thought of me

25:02.196 --> 25:04.372
not profiting from my hard work.

25:04.415 --> 25:08.245
I mean, come on,
that's pretty special.

25:08.289 --> 25:10.334
It is indeed.

25:10.378 --> 25:14.251
No further questions,
Your Honor.

25:16.297 --> 25:18.821
Just one question
for you, Chef Hansen.

25:18.865 --> 25:22.129
If Greg Valerian
was such an amazing boss

25:22.172 --> 25:25.393
and you were so lucky
to be there,

25:25.436 --> 25:27.395
then why were you looking
for another job?

25:27.438 --> 25:28.614
Wait.

25:28.657 --> 25:31.225
No, no, no, no, no.
That's not exactly true.

25:31.268 --> 25:32.574
Oh, so you weren't interviewing

25:32.618 --> 25:33.793
with other investors
and restaurants?

25:33.836 --> 25:35.185
No.

25:35.229 --> 25:37.361
Is that your sworn testimony
under oath?

25:37.405 --> 25:41.801
Okay, I had started
to look around a little.

25:41.844 --> 25:44.281
Sometimes you just
got to change it up.

25:44.325 --> 25:45.456
DRAKE: I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

25:45.500 --> 25:46.675
A minute and a half ago,

25:46.719 --> 25:48.329
you were talking about
what a special place

25:48.372 --> 25:51.419
the Briarcrest Room was and how
grateful you were to your boss,

25:51.462 --> 25:53.421
and now you're saying you were
looking to "change it up"?

25:53.464 --> 25:57.381
Greg had gotten busy.

25:57.425 --> 25:59.993
Building a new place
in Brooklyn.

26:00.036 --> 26:01.647
It was getting harder
to get his attention,

26:01.690 --> 26:03.257
to get the answers
I needed

26:03.300 --> 26:05.172
to keep the kitchen
what it needed to be.

26:05.215 --> 26:07.391
It sounds worse than it was.

26:07.435 --> 26:09.872
You take some meetings.
You do some interviews.

26:09.916 --> 26:11.134
Doesn't mean anything.

26:11.178 --> 26:13.397
Oh, I beg to differ.

26:13.441 --> 26:16.270
Now go back to where you said it
was "hard to get his attention."

26:16.313 --> 26:18.359
Would you say that Greg had been
neglecting his duties

26:18.402 --> 26:20.274
at the Briarcrest Room?Objection!

26:20.317 --> 26:23.190
I'll withdraw.
No further questions.

26:25.409 --> 26:27.324
BENNY:
We're starting to think

26:27.368 --> 26:31.111
that the only way forward is
to put you on the stand, Greg.

26:31.154 --> 26:32.765
Let you speak
for yourself.

26:34.505 --> 26:38.161
You guys go ahead.
I need a minute.

26:43.340 --> 26:45.473
I just finished
with the arson expert.

26:45.516 --> 26:46.953
And?

26:46.996 --> 26:48.955
She said the fire inspector's
methodology was sound,

26:48.998 --> 26:51.174
but she reran the chemical
samples through a system

26:51.218 --> 26:54.613
using chromatography
and spectrographic analysis,

26:54.656 --> 26:56.789
something the FDNY didn't have
access to on this case.

26:56.832 --> 26:59.182
That was quite a drumroll.

26:59.226 --> 27:01.358
She found traces of gasoline.

27:01.402 --> 27:04.318
Gasoline's not commonly found

27:04.361 --> 27:05.928
among restaurant
cleaning products?

27:05.972 --> 27:09.366
No, it is not.
The fire was arson.

27:15.938 --> 27:17.940
[knock on door]He moved out of state.

27:22.336 --> 27:23.685
You talk to Marissa yet?

27:23.729 --> 27:27.994
No, and I'm not going to
and neither are you.

27:28.037 --> 27:32.172
Dr. Bull, it was arson.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.609
She has to know.
We have to tell her.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.089
I mean, this is her life.

27:36.132 --> 27:38.308
She was the one who had
misgivings in the first place.

27:38.352 --> 27:39.570
I know it's her life,

27:39.614 --> 27:41.703
which is why no one
is going to say anything

27:41.747 --> 27:44.445
unless and until we have proof.

27:44.488 --> 27:45.838
We have proof.

27:45.881 --> 27:48.492
Proof the fire was arson,
not that Greg did it.

27:48.536 --> 27:50.103
If we tell Marissa

27:50.146 --> 27:51.713
that her husband
is criminally responsible

27:51.757 --> 27:54.107
for the death of a man,
her marriage is over.

27:54.150 --> 27:57.284
That is a bell
we cannot un-ring.

27:57.327 --> 27:59.329
So...

27:59.373 --> 28:02.202
before we go around broadcasting
something we suspect,

28:02.245 --> 28:05.292
we need to find out
if our suspicions are true,

28:05.335 --> 28:09.383
or, even better, if they're not.

29:12.533 --> 29:15.536
That's when Benny will run you
through a series of questions

29:15.579 --> 29:17.016
about how you run your business.

29:17.059 --> 29:18.582
Every chance you get,

29:18.626 --> 29:21.194
stress why you love
your restaurants,

29:21.237 --> 29:24.850
and if you're honest and open,
the jury will feel that,

29:24.893 --> 29:27.069
and they'll be more inclined
to believe what you say.

29:27.113 --> 29:28.854
Simple as that?

29:28.897 --> 29:30.812
It's as simple as that.

29:30.856 --> 29:35.643
Now, cross-examination is where
we can run into trouble.

29:35.686 --> 29:37.427
Pardon the
interruption.

29:37.471 --> 29:39.865
Greg.

29:39.908 --> 29:41.954
You mind if I
do the honors?

29:43.607 --> 29:45.827
You want to prep
Greg yourself?

29:45.871 --> 29:47.698
Yeah, I just feel like
keeping my hand in.

29:47.742 --> 29:51.441
Don't want to get rusty,
and Greg's kind of like family.

29:51.485 --> 29:54.357
CHUNK:
Whatever you say.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.665
Thank you, Dr. Bull.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.101
Taking the time.

29:59.145 --> 30:01.364
Jason.
Jason.

30:02.713 --> 30:04.759
So why didn't you wake
your wife with a kiss

30:04.803 --> 30:06.369
when you came home
on the night of the fire?

30:06.413 --> 30:09.720
GREG:
Hmm?

30:11.766 --> 30:13.681
I really need to know.

30:13.724 --> 30:16.684
Was it because you were
later than usual or...?

30:16.727 --> 30:18.686
From what I understand,
you normally get home

30:18.729 --> 30:20.862
between midnight and 1:00.

30:20.906 --> 30:23.343
Of course, the fire was at 3:00.

30:23.386 --> 30:27.651
I'm sorry, could you speak up?
I'm having trouble hearing you.

30:27.695 --> 30:31.394
This is like... practice, right?

30:31.438 --> 30:33.135
You're pretending
to be the woman

30:33.179 --> 30:34.441
from the district attorney's
office?

30:36.443 --> 30:38.053
Right?

30:38.097 --> 30:40.708
They're just questions.

30:40.751 --> 30:43.232
The answers shouldn't change

30:43.276 --> 30:45.756
no matter who's doing
the asking.

30:45.800 --> 30:49.586
Did Marissa
say something to you?

30:49.630 --> 30:52.198
New subject, just curious.
How much do you stand to gain

30:52.241 --> 30:54.287
from the fire insurance policy
on the restaurant?

30:55.941 --> 30:59.814
What do you mean, gain?
The restaurant's gone.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.772
JC is dead.
No one gains anything.

31:01.816 --> 31:05.428
Except for insurance money.

31:05.472 --> 31:07.256
How much is it?
How much do you get?

31:07.300 --> 31:09.432
A lot.

31:10.651 --> 31:12.740
But none of it's mine.
None of it's liquid.

31:12.783 --> 31:16.265
All that money is committed
to rebuilding the restaurant.

31:16.309 --> 31:20.704
Really? You weren't planning on
using it to repay investors

31:20.748 --> 31:24.186
so you could keep control
of the company?

31:24.230 --> 31:26.449
That's not how the contract
is written.

31:26.493 --> 31:29.409
I have to use the money
to rebuild the restaurant.

31:29.452 --> 31:32.803
The insurance company
won't give it to me otherwise.

31:32.847 --> 31:35.284
Happy to show you the policy.

31:35.328 --> 31:37.896
Excellent answer.

31:37.939 --> 31:40.333
Now, what if someone said,

31:40.376 --> 31:42.813
"Turns out it was
actually arson"?

31:44.337 --> 31:45.991
GREG: [stammers]
What was actually arson?

31:46.034 --> 31:47.862
And who is "someone"?

31:47.906 --> 31:49.385
I'm saying it.

31:49.429 --> 31:51.170
I hired the best
expert there is,

31:51.213 --> 31:52.823
and she says it's arson.

31:52.867 --> 31:55.870
So what I need to know
from you is:

31:55.914 --> 31:57.176
were you in on it?

31:57.219 --> 31:58.960
Are you the one
that set the fire,

31:59.004 --> 32:01.876
or did you just pay
to make it happen?

32:06.925 --> 32:09.188
Do you believe in redemption?

32:11.712 --> 32:14.845
I would need to know about
your transgressions first.

32:17.022 --> 32:20.939
I am the reason my marriage
didn't work the first time.

32:24.246 --> 32:27.597
My wife Marissa was away a lot,

32:27.641 --> 32:29.338
and I felt
that gave me permission

32:29.382 --> 32:30.644
to feel sorry for myself.

32:30.687 --> 32:34.735
And feeling sorry for yourself
is no fun alone.

32:36.737 --> 32:37.868
Getting her back

32:37.912 --> 32:40.132
a second time...

32:43.352 --> 32:47.313
...is as close to a miracle as
I am ever likely to experience.

32:50.838 --> 32:52.231
The night you're asking about,

32:52.274 --> 32:55.712
I got home at the regular time,
but I was exhausted.

32:55.756 --> 32:58.715
Like, sleep-in-your-clothes
exhausted.

32:58.759 --> 33:03.372
And she looked so... content.

33:03.416 --> 33:07.986
So... beautiful...

33:08.029 --> 33:10.771
lying there, asleep.

33:13.339 --> 33:18.300
So I thought, okay.
We've gotten there.

33:18.344 --> 33:20.737
I'm not gonna wake her up.
I don't have to.

33:20.781 --> 33:23.436
She doesn't need me to do that.

33:23.479 --> 33:25.742
She knows I love her.

33:25.786 --> 33:27.744
I can see it on her face.

33:32.227 --> 33:34.273
Guess I was wrong.

33:36.971 --> 33:38.886
BULL:
Okay.

33:38.929 --> 33:41.932
But did you set the fire?

33:45.458 --> 33:46.981
My other transgressions,

33:47.025 --> 33:49.592
my lifetime
of transgressions

33:49.636 --> 33:54.510
ceased to matter the day I broke
ground on that restaurant.

33:54.554 --> 33:56.991
I was determined,
despite all the bad choices

33:57.035 --> 33:58.514
I might have made in my past,

33:58.558 --> 33:59.733
despite having always been told

33:59.776 --> 34:02.344
that I would never amount
to anything...

34:02.388 --> 34:05.130
To build a beautiful thing,

34:05.173 --> 34:10.178
an enchanted place where people
could have magical experiences.

34:10.222 --> 34:14.748
Where I would employ people
and train people,

34:14.791 --> 34:18.665
serve fabulous food
and intoxicating drinks.

34:18.708 --> 34:22.712
But the best part...

34:22.756 --> 34:25.019
was after all the people
had left,

34:25.063 --> 34:27.282
after all the chairs were
on the table.

34:27.326 --> 34:29.980
I would sit there alone,

34:30.024 --> 34:32.113
thinking...

34:33.984 --> 34:36.117
...look at what I did.

34:36.161 --> 34:38.424
Look what I built.

34:38.467 --> 34:41.949
None of this would exist

34:41.992 --> 34:44.647
if it wasn't for me.

34:44.691 --> 34:47.955
I would no more put a match
to that place

34:47.998 --> 34:50.349
than I would betray my wife.

34:50.392 --> 34:55.571
They are... my redemption.

34:59.184 --> 35:01.403
They are my salvation.

35:09.759 --> 35:12.153
Well, for what it's worth,

35:12.197 --> 35:15.025
I think you'll make
an excellent witness.

35:17.289 --> 35:21.162
Now we just have to figure out
who did set that fire.

35:21.206 --> 35:24.948
Preferably within
the next 18 hours.

35:30.432 --> 35:31.433
I checked out the
insurance policy,

35:31.477 --> 35:32.695
and Greg was telling
the truth.

35:32.739 --> 35:34.828
He has no access
to the payout.

35:34.871 --> 35:36.917
It has to be spent
to rebuild the restaurant.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.919
And if for some reason
they elect not to rebuild,

35:38.962 --> 35:40.834
the only people who get
any money at all

35:40.877 --> 35:42.096
are the original
investors,

35:42.140 --> 35:43.532
and they only get enough
to be made whole.

35:43.576 --> 35:46.535
So, no one stood to
profit from the fire?

35:46.579 --> 35:49.147
Well, one person did.

35:49.190 --> 35:51.932
Six years after the
restaurant was opened,

35:51.975 --> 35:53.847
Chef Hansen
was made a partner.

35:53.890 --> 35:55.501
Not because he invested
any capital,

35:55.544 --> 35:58.112
but as an inducement to
keep him from ever leaving.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.723
So, as it happens,
he would be the only one

36:00.767 --> 36:02.899
to walk away from this
with fresh cash.

36:02.943 --> 36:04.510
And he needs cash.

36:04.553 --> 36:06.816
Hansen wasn't looking
for a new job.

36:06.860 --> 36:09.819
He was looking for partners
for his own restaurant.

36:09.863 --> 36:12.213
He made an offer for
a place in the Bowery.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.607
He just needed money
for the down payment.

36:14.650 --> 36:16.826
Sounds like Hansen might be
our arsonist.

36:16.870 --> 36:18.785
Yeah. And if we're gonna
introduce arson in court,

36:18.828 --> 36:19.960
we need something solid--

36:20.003 --> 36:21.048
real proof that it
wasn't our client.

36:21.091 --> 36:23.964
And we have to do it
in the next...

36:28.011 --> 36:30.188
You all right, boss?

36:30.231 --> 36:33.495
Taylor, you have
your laptop with you?

36:35.149 --> 36:37.456
Great. We have work to do.

36:37.499 --> 36:38.848
BENNY:
Chef Hansen...

36:38.892 --> 36:41.242
thank you for agreeing

36:41.286 --> 36:43.244
to take the stand
one more time.

36:43.288 --> 36:44.506
Happy to do it.

36:44.550 --> 36:46.726
BENNY:
Just for the record,
what time did you

36:46.769 --> 36:49.032
close the restaurant
on the night of the fire?

36:49.076 --> 36:50.860
I think I locked up
around 1:00 a.m.

36:50.904 --> 36:52.645
And then what did you do?

36:52.688 --> 36:56.083
Grabbed a drink
with Kim, my sous chef.

36:56.126 --> 36:58.868
At the Rosemead Pub,
is that right?

36:58.912 --> 37:03.090
Yes. That's right.

37:03.133 --> 37:05.135
And when did you leave the pub,
would you say?

37:05.179 --> 37:07.573
Objection!
Your Honor, relevance?

37:07.616 --> 37:10.793
As riveting as the minutia
of Mr. Hansen's evening is,

37:10.837 --> 37:12.491
I don't see what it has
to do with the case.

37:12.534 --> 37:14.319
Your Honor, I guarantee
you will see the relevance

37:14.362 --> 37:15.972
if you'll allow me to continue.

37:16.016 --> 37:18.192
Get to the point, Mr. Colón.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.846
Quickly.

37:19.889 --> 37:21.717
So what time did you
leave the pub?

37:21.761 --> 37:27.027
I hopped a cab home
around 2:30, I think.

37:27.070 --> 37:28.985
And you went straight home?

37:29.029 --> 37:30.770
You didn't stop anywhere first?

37:30.813 --> 37:34.382
No. I was tired.
I just went home.

37:34.426 --> 37:37.080
Ah.

37:37.124 --> 37:41.215
Your Honor, we'd like
to enter into evidence

37:41.259 --> 37:45.306
the GPS data from
Chef Hansen's smartwatch

37:45.350 --> 37:47.352
on the night of the fire.Objection!

37:47.395 --> 37:51.051
The smartwatch app is
open-source.

37:51.094 --> 37:54.968
The A.D.A. had the same access
to this information as we did.

37:55.011 --> 37:56.143
I'll allow it.

37:56.186 --> 37:57.971
BENNY:
Thank you, Your Honor.
Thank you.

37:58.014 --> 38:01.627
Chef Hansen, were you
wearing your smartwatch

38:01.670 --> 38:03.019
on the night of the fire?

38:03.063 --> 38:07.023
It certainly looks
like you were.

38:07.067 --> 38:10.113
It-it corroborates
your testimony.

38:10.157 --> 38:12.028
You-you left the
restaurant at 1:00 a.m.,

38:12.072 --> 38:13.639
then on to the Rosemead.

38:13.682 --> 38:18.600
The only thing is... it doesn't
have you going straight home

38:18.644 --> 38:20.254
after you left the bar.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.909
Your smartwatch app
has you going back

38:22.952 --> 38:24.432
to the Briarcrest Room.

38:24.476 --> 38:27.043
As a matter of fact,
the GPS data has you

38:27.087 --> 38:31.134
in the restaurant
from 2:52 to 3:07 a.m.

38:31.178 --> 38:34.268
[gallery murmuring]

38:34.312 --> 38:38.751
Actually...
I forgot my knife roll.

38:38.794 --> 38:40.883
Keep my knives in it.

38:40.927 --> 38:44.104
I've had it for 20 years.
I had to go back and get it.

38:44.147 --> 38:49.544
So, what, you just forgot
about that when I asked you?

38:49.588 --> 38:54.201
I mean... it wasn't a big deal.

38:54.244 --> 38:56.986
But on this night,
there was a fire.

38:57.030 --> 38:58.901
Right around the time
your watch says

38:58.945 --> 39:00.294
you went back
to the restaurant.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.992
You sure you didn't start a fire

39:03.036 --> 39:05.081
so that you could use your cut
of the insurance money

39:05.125 --> 39:08.041
to put a down payment
on your own place?

39:08.084 --> 39:09.434
[gallery murmuring]

39:12.132 --> 39:15.614
Never mind. No further
questions, Your Honor.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.229
Man...

39:28.757 --> 39:32.239
We the jury find the
defendant, Greg Valerian,

39:32.282 --> 39:34.676
not guilty.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.461
MARISSA [gasps]:
Oh, my...[gavel bangs]

39:45.078 --> 39:46.645
[mouths]:
Thank you.

39:46.688 --> 39:48.777
[mouths]:
You're welcome.

39:56.219 --> 39:59.658
[laughing]:
I am really, really happy.

39:59.701 --> 40:03.488
Aren't you really,
really happy?

40:03.531 --> 40:05.577
Honestly, I'm...

40:05.620 --> 40:08.623
kind of confused.

40:08.667 --> 40:13.367
You told your boss
about our kiss thing?

40:13.411 --> 40:17.937
You made an issue out of not
getting a kiss that night?

40:17.980 --> 40:20.069
Because you
thought it meant

40:20.113 --> 40:22.463
I must have been out
late setting a fire.

40:22.507 --> 40:23.638
No. Of course not.

40:23.682 --> 40:25.118
I just...

40:25.161 --> 40:26.772
You just. I know.

40:26.815 --> 40:30.428
You just can't
help yourself.

40:33.735 --> 40:36.564
You are the sum
of your experiences,

40:36.608 --> 40:39.045
as you love to remind me.

40:39.088 --> 40:41.917
And so many of your
experiences have been...

40:43.441 --> 40:44.920
...not great.

40:44.964 --> 40:48.924
Your first experience
with me... not great.

40:48.968 --> 40:52.493
So I get it.

40:52.537 --> 40:55.714
But I don't know
if I can accept it.

40:58.064 --> 41:01.459
I wanted you beside me.

41:01.502 --> 41:04.853
Behind me.

41:04.897 --> 41:06.986
Believing in me.

41:10.380 --> 41:13.558
Never really felt
you were there.

41:27.876 --> 41:29.791
Um...

41:32.794 --> 41:36.189
I don't disagree
with anything you said.

41:38.278 --> 41:40.672
I'm not proud of it.

41:43.283 --> 41:45.851
I wanted to be there for you.

41:47.896 --> 41:50.508
But I am who I am.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.338
I can only do what I can do.

41:57.340 --> 41:59.952
And I can only be who I can be.

42:02.650 --> 42:06.349
Please give me time.

42:06.393 --> 42:10.528
Please give me
a chance to learn.

42:16.882 --> 42:18.666
What was that?

42:18.710 --> 42:22.365
I just wanted to let
you know I was home.

42:24.280 --> 42:26.239
[cries]

42:26.282 --> 42:27.893
Come on.

42:27.936 --> 42:30.548
Let's go to bed.
