What are you doing here?

18:22.903 --> 18:24.236
I went to the prison,

18:24.238 --> 18:26.504
but the guard said
you were already gone.

18:26.506 --> 18:29.575
The guard said you mentioned
heading back to the mountains,

18:29.577 --> 18:31.577
so I --
I took a shot.

18:31.579 --> 18:32.578
Why?

18:32.580 --> 18:34.512
Why would you come
all the way --

18:34.514 --> 18:36.181
I wanted to talk more about
all that stuff you said

18:36.183 --> 18:37.649
before you got arrested

18:37.651 --> 18:38.984
and speared in the boob
by that marlin.

18:38.986 --> 18:40.586
You know,
all that stuff about

18:40.588 --> 18:42.054
working at a strip club

18:42.056 --> 18:43.855
and jerking off all those guys
in that storage room.

18:43.857 --> 18:45.523
Yeah, I get it.
I'm a bad person.

18:45.525 --> 18:46.925
No, that's just it.

18:46.927 --> 18:48.660
I don't think you are.

18:48.662 --> 18:52.530
At least, I don't want
to believe you are.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.866
I can't.
What are you
talking about?

18:54.868 --> 18:58.270
Look, when you revealed all
that stuff about yourself,

18:58.272 --> 18:59.404
I didn't know what to say,

18:59.406 --> 19:00.939
because it all sounded
so familiar.

19:00.941 --> 19:03.541
I had all "C"s and "B"s
in community college

19:03.543 --> 19:06.011
when I saw Matthew McConaughey
in "Magic Mike,"

19:06.013 --> 19:07.946
and my world changed
forever.

19:07.948 --> 19:10.215
I secretly started
working at a strip club

19:10.217 --> 19:12.017
where the club made the guys
dress as characters,

19:12.019 --> 19:18.556
like police man, fire man,
trash man, sales man,

19:18.558 --> 19:24.362
medicine man, con man,
handy man, milk man,

19:24.364 --> 19:27.699
space man, cave man.

19:27.701 --> 19:29.234
Basically,
anything with "man" in it

19:29.236 --> 19:30.368
was recommended.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.504
I dressed up
like a business man.

19:32.506 --> 19:33.571
Only, to make it sexy,

19:33.573 --> 19:35.573
I put my junk
in a dress sock

19:35.575 --> 19:36.975
and I pulled it through
the fly in my pants

19:36.977 --> 19:40.578
so it would, you know,
flop around, you know?

19:40.580 --> 19:42.514
Touching
was against the law,

19:42.516 --> 19:44.850
but as Matty Mack says
in "Magic Mike,"

19:44.852 --> 19:48.186
"There's a lot of
law breakers out there."

19:48.188 --> 19:49.587
Then, one afternoon,

19:49.589 --> 19:52.257
I came home during
my mother's new book club

19:52.259 --> 19:54.926
to find myself face to face

19:54.928 --> 19:56.462
with a room
full of 50-year-old women

19:56.464 --> 19:58.796
who had all had
my cock-filled dress sock

19:58.798 --> 19:59.865
in their hand.

19:59.867 --> 20:01.933
In some cases, worse.

20:01.935 --> 20:03.601
I was horrified.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.337
I mean, every bad thing
I had ever done

20:05.339 --> 20:06.872
was sitting
in my living room,

20:06.874 --> 20:10.275
talking to my mother
about Dean Koontz.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.010
So, I left town.

20:12.012 --> 20:14.813
And I went to the beach
to make a fresh start.

20:17.417 --> 20:23.221
Vivian, I never made
a move on you because...

20:23.223 --> 20:24.756
I don't make moves
on anyone.

20:24.758 --> 20:26.358
I don't want
to fall for someone

20:26.360 --> 20:27.693
and have to keep
my past a secret,

20:27.695 --> 20:29.695
and I didn't think
anyone would want me

20:29.697 --> 20:31.497
if they knew
I was damaged goods.

20:31.499 --> 20:34.099
But if I can believe
that you're a good person

20:34.101 --> 20:36.768
and you just happened
to do some bad things,

20:36.770 --> 20:41.507
then...maybe I can believe that
about myself.

20:41.509 --> 20:42.841
And if I believe it,

20:42.843 --> 20:46.645
then maybe
somebody else will, too.

20:48.782 --> 20:50.182
