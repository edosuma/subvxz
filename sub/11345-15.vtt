(male announcer)
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:08.609 --> 00:12.046
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.715
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:14.748 --> 00:16.417
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.450 --> 00:18.119
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:18.152 --> 00:20.054
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:20.088 --> 00:22.123
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.825
- GARCON!

00:24.858 --> 00:28.129
UN VERRE DE ROSE,
S'IL VOUS PLAIT!

00:28.162 --> 00:29.197
[speaking French]

00:29.230 --> 00:31.832
- BRENDA, PIPE DOWN.
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SLEEP.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.668
- I HAVE TO LEARN HOW
TO SAY THIS BEFORE WE LAND.

00:34.702 --> 00:38.506
HELEN SAYS IF YOU DON'T ORDER IN
FRENCH, THEY SPIT IN YOUR FOOD.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.142
- HELEN IN A UNE MO-RON.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.144
GET SOME SLEEP.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.478
[woman screams]

00:44.512 --> 00:45.479
[screaming in French]

00:45.513 --> 00:47.248
- STOP! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

00:47.281 --> 00:49.683
GET HER OFF OF ME!

00:49.717 --> 00:53.121
[pleading in French]

00:53.154 --> 00:54.655
[man shouting in French]

00:54.688 --> 00:56.590
[all screaming]

00:56.624 --> 00:57.858
- OH, MY GOD.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.926
WH--WHAT HAPPENED?

00:58.959 --> 01:01.429
- THE KID SAYS THAT THIS PERVERT
TRIED TO RAPE HER.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.800
- TURNS OUT THE SCHLUB
NEVER TOUCHED HER.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.837
- SURE? IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST
TIME AN UNACCOMPANIED MINOR

01:09.870 --> 01:11.239
WAS MOLESTED ON A PLANE.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.306
- AIRLINES MAKE 'EM WEAR
THOSE BIG BUTTONS

01:12.340 --> 01:13.507
THAT SCREAM "EASY PICKIN'S."

01:13.541 --> 01:15.776
- YEAH, BUT IN THIS CASE,
HE WAS JUST CLOSING THE SHADE.

01:15.809 --> 01:19.480
SHE FREAKED OUT WHEN SHE WOKE UP
AND SAW HIM REACHING OVER HER.

01:19.513 --> 01:20.714
- SOUNDS LIKE PTSD.

01:20.748 --> 01:24.118
- SHE WAS RAPED TWO NIGHTS AGO
AT A PARTY HERE IN THE CITY.

01:24.152 --> 01:26.487
APPARENTLY THE PERP FLEW HER
OVER IN HIS PRIVATE JET.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.821
- THEN SHIPPED HER BACK
COMMERCIAL

01:27.855 --> 01:28.656
WHEN HE WAS DONE WITH HER?

01:28.689 --> 01:30.391
THAT'S CLASSY.
- WHERE IS SHE NOW?

01:30.424 --> 01:32.260
- PARIS.

01:32.293 --> 01:35.296
- [speaking French]

01:38.532 --> 01:41.802
- WE FLEW TO NEW YORK TWO DAYS
AGO FOR A MODELING JOB.

01:41.835 --> 01:46.874
- [speaking French]

01:46.907 --> 01:49.343
- BUT IT WAS JUST
A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

01:49.377 --> 01:50.811
WE WERE HIS PRESENT.

01:50.844 --> 01:51.879
- WHOSE PRESENT?

01:51.912 --> 01:57.251
[both speaking French]

01:57.285 --> 01:59.420
- THE BILLIONAIRE, THE ONE WHO
OWNED THE JET.

01:59.453 --> 02:02.223
- DOES SHE KNOW HIS NAME?

02:02.256 --> 02:04.425
- JORDAN.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.161
[speaking French]

02:07.195 --> 02:09.930
- JORDAN, HE WANTED A MASSAGE.

02:09.963 --> 02:14.235
- [speaking French]

02:14.268 --> 02:15.903
- BUT I HAD
TO TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES.

02:15.936 --> 02:17.805
HE CLIMBED ON TOP OF ME.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.273
IT HURT.

02:19.307 --> 02:22.843
I STARTED TO BLEED,
AND IT WOULDN'T STOP.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.745
THE DOCTOR CAME.

02:24.778 --> 02:28.216
- DOMINIQUE, WE'RE GOING
TO ARREST THIS MAN,

02:28.249 --> 02:30.384
BUT WE NEED YOU
TO RETURN TO NEW YORK

02:30.418 --> 02:31.752
SO YOU CAN TESTIFY.

02:31.785 --> 02:39.493
- RETOURNER NEW YORK? NON. NON!

02:39.527 --> 02:43.397
[yelling in French]

02:43.431 --> 02:45.366
- SORRY, UH...

02:45.399 --> 02:47.635
IT APPEARS SHE DOES NOT WANT
TO PURSUE THIS MATTER.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.371
- BUT WE HAVE
A BILLIONAIRE PERVERT

02:50.404 --> 02:52.706
FLYING IN UNDERAGE GIRLS
FOR SEX,

02:52.740 --> 02:55.809
SO TRUST ME, WE WILL
BE PURSUING THE MATTER.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.845
- BON CHANCE.

02:57.878 --> 03:00.881
[static buzzes]

03:51.064 --> 03:52.600
- THE VICTIM'S IN FRANCE,
"PARLEY-VOOS" NO ENGLISH,

03:52.633 --> 03:55.369
AND SHE WON'T PRESS CHARGES.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.236
SHE SOUNDS LIKE A WINNER.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.104
- YEAH, AND THAT'S NOT
THE WORST OF IT.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.373
- THE MAN SHE'S ACCUSING
IS JORDAN HAYES.

03:59.407 --> 04:00.674
- JORDAN HAYES, WHO'S THAT?

04:00.708 --> 04:02.910
- HE'S A BILLIONAIRE DEFENSE
CONTRACTOR

04:02.943 --> 04:04.678
AND PERSONAL FRIEND
OF JUST ABOUT EVERYONE

04:04.712 --> 04:06.314
WHO'S GOT THE POWER
TO TAKE AWAY OUR PENSIONS.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.449
- CRAGEN'S ORDERED US
TO TREAD LIGHTLY.

04:08.482 --> 04:09.383
- DOMINIQUE'S 12 YEARS OLD.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.319
SHE SAID AN OLDER GIRL
FLEW OUT WITH HER.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.820
- YEAH, AND BY OLDER,
HE MEANS 15.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.422
- ANOTHER VICTIM?

04:14.455 --> 04:16.357
- WE'RE NOT SURE.
WE'RE TRACKING HER DOWN NOW.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.459
- SO YOU GOT NOTHING
TO LEAN ON HAYES WITH,

04:18.492 --> 04:20.894
AND A GUY LIKE THAT'S NOT COMING
IN WITHOUT AN ARMY OF LAWYERS.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.830
- WE'RE NOT SAYING BOO UNTIL WE
CORROBORATE DOMINIQUE'S STORY.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.366
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS WORKING ON--
HEY, I WAS LOOKING AT THAT.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.934
- OFFICIAL POLICE BUSINESS.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.902
- HAYES'S PARTY MAKE
THE SOCIETY PAGE?

04:30.871 --> 04:33.574
"GLITTERATI TURN OUT FOR JORDAN
HAYES' 50TH BIRTHDAY BASH."

04:33.607 --> 04:35.075
- WHO WAS THERE?

04:35.108 --> 04:37.778
- THE DUCHESS MARIA VON
TESSENBERG,

04:37.811 --> 04:38.812
THE MAYOR,

04:38.846 --> 04:40.681
A FORMER PRESIDENT.

04:40.714 --> 04:41.849
- DIBS.

04:41.882 --> 04:42.983
- AND THE POLICE COMMISSIONER.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.518
- THAT'S GONNA MAKE OUR JOB
EASIER.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.886
- YOU GOTTA LET HIM KNOW
WE'RE INVESTIGATING.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.522
- I ALREADY HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH ONE P.P.

04:48.556 --> 04:51.625
BUT IN THE MEANTIME, WE'RE NOT
SPEAKING TO ANY OF THESE PEOPLE

04:51.659 --> 04:52.893
WITHOUT CONCRETE EVIDENCE.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.662
- JUST BECAUSE JORDAN HAYES
GAVE HALF A MIL

04:54.695 --> 04:56.730
TO THE PATROLMAN'S BENEVOLENT
ASSOCIATION

04:56.764 --> 04:58.098
DOESN'T GIVE HIM A PASS.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.033
- WHO IS THIS GUY? HOW COME
I NEVER HEARD OF HIM?

05:00.067 --> 05:02.370
- BECAUSE YOU DON'T KEEP TABS ON
THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX,

05:02.403 --> 05:03.604
LIKE I DO.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.874
JORDAN MADE HIS BILLIONS SELLING
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION

05:06.907 --> 05:08.976
AT HEFTY PRICES
TO THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.978
- WE KNOW HE OWNS
HIS OWN PRIVATE PLANE.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.113
- TWO OF 'EM.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.815
- ANY OTHER PICTURES
OF THIS DOUCHE?

05:14.848 --> 05:15.849
- FOR SUCH A HIGH-PROFILE GUY,

05:15.883 --> 05:17.651
HE MANAGES TO STAY
UNDER THE RADAR PRETTY GOOD.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.453
THIS IS ALL I COULD FIND ON HIM.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.822
THERE HE IS
IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.891
- THAT MUST BE HIS YACHT.

05:23.924 --> 05:27.828
GIVING AN ADDRESS AT HUDSON U.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.730
- HAVE YOU GOT A PICTURE
OF HIS ACCUSER?

05:29.763 --> 05:30.998
- I GOT DOMINIQUE
ON THE TELECONFERENCE,

05:31.031 --> 05:32.099
AND I'M STILL WORKING
ON THE IDENTITY

05:32.132 --> 05:33.834
OF THE GIRL
THAT CAME OVER WITH HER.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.904
- DOMINIQUE CLAIMS SHE WAS
JORDAN'S GIFT, FROM WHOM?

05:36.937 --> 05:38.872
- WHY DON'T WE PULL IN
THE BIRTHDAY BOY AND ASK HIM?

05:38.906 --> 05:40.574
- NOT YET.

05:40.608 --> 05:41.742
- IF HE WAS A BLUE-COLLAR
KIDDIE-DIDDLER--

05:41.775 --> 05:42.676
- WELL, HE ISN'T.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.846
SO BEFORE WE START FLINGING
ACCUSATIONS,

05:45.879 --> 05:47.881
LET'S MAKE SURE THE GIRL'S STORY
CHECKS OUT.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.618
- DOMINIQUE SAID JORDAN BROUGHT
'EM OVER IN HIS PRIVATE JET?

05:50.651 --> 05:52.920
- LET'S CONFIRM THAT
WITH CUSTOMS.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.690
- DO YOU HAVE A RECORD OF HER
ENTERING THE COUNTRY?

05:56.724 --> 05:59.026
- YEAH, DOMINIQUE MOREAU WAS ON
MR. HAYES'S JET

05:59.059 --> 06:00.127
FROM PARIS TO NEW YORK.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.596
- YOU SEE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
COMING THROUGH CUSTOMS.

06:02.630 --> 06:03.897
WHY DO YOU REMEMBER HER?

06:03.931 --> 06:06.634
- HAYES'S PASSENGERS GET
THE FULL V.I.P. TREATMENT.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.602
I WENT ON THE PLANE AND
PROCESSED THEM PERSONALLY.

06:08.636 --> 06:09.570
- HOW DOES THAT WORK?

06:09.603 --> 06:11.939
- I CHECK VISAS,
AND MAKE SURE THE PASSENGERS

06:11.972 --> 06:13.507
ARE LISTED
ON THE PLANE'S MANIFEST,

06:13.541 --> 06:15.876
THEN I SCAN FINGERPRINTS
WITH THIS MOBILE DEVICE,

06:15.909 --> 06:17.878
THEN I TAKE PHOTOS
FOR OUR RECORDS.

06:17.911 --> 06:18.946
- PHOTOS, WE'RE GONNA NEED
COPIES OF THOSE.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.013
- SURE.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.516
- DOES HAYES FLY IN A LOT
OF INTERNATIONAL GUESTS?

06:22.550 --> 06:24.952
- ROYALTY, DIGNITARIES,
CELEBRITIES, MODELS.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.921
- OKAY, HOW ABOUT GIRLS AS YOUNG
AS DOMINIQUE?

06:27.955 --> 06:29.690
- HE LIKES 'EM YOUNG.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.426
BUT THE GIRLS I SEE ARE USUALLY
THIS SIDE OF LEGAL.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.895
- SO THESE ARE ALL
THE PASSENGERS ON THE PLANE?

06:34.928 --> 06:36.163
- YEAH.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.131
- DOMINIQUE,

06:38.165 --> 06:40.868
NICOLE PHILLIPPE,
THE GIRL SHE FLEW OVER WITH.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.173
- THOUGHT THERE
WERE ONLY TWO GIRLS.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.808
WHO'S DAHLIA JESSUP?

06:47.841 --> 06:48.876
- FREQUENT FLIER ON HIS PLANE.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.944
HIS ON-AGAIN OFF-AGAIN
GIRLFRIEND.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.213
I READ PAGE SIX.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.815
- DID SHE FLY BACK
WITH NICOLE YESTERDAY?

06:54.848 --> 06:57.885
- LET ME CHECK
THE FLIGHT HISTORY.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.853
NOPE.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.755
- YOU HAVE ANY PEDIGREE
INFORMATION ON HER?

07:01.789 --> 07:03.924
- YEAH, SHE LIVES IN THE CITY.
I CAN PULL THAT FOR YA.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.026
- HOLD UP.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.728
HAYES IS QUITE THE JET-SETTER.

07:07.761 --> 07:08.996
CAMBODIA, BRAZIL, THAILAND.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.998
- SEX TOURISM HOT SPOTS.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.533
- WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SPEAK
WITH THE PILOT.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.502
NOW, IS THAT PLANE FROM PARIS
BACK YET?

07:14.535 --> 07:18.005
- GOOD TIMING.
WHEELS DOWN IN 20.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.173
- HAYES HAS A FEMALE PILOT.
THAT'S INTERESTING.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.209
- SOMETHING TELLS ME
THAT HIS GLASS CEILING

07:22.242 --> 07:24.812
IS THE MIRROR OVER HIS BED.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.880
- YOU GET NICOLE BACK
IN ONE PIECE?

07:26.914 --> 07:29.182
- WE OUTRAN SOME WEATHER,
HIT SOME POCKETS,

07:29.216 --> 07:30.183
ROUTINE FLIGHT.

07:30.217 --> 07:33.887
- BRAZIL, NEW YORK, PARIS TWICE.
ALL IN ONE WEEK?

07:33.921 --> 07:36.624
YOU LADIES MUST BE EXHAUSTED.

07:36.657 --> 07:39.092
- I'M SORRY, BUT WAS THAT
AN F.A.A. BADGE?

07:39.126 --> 07:40.861
- ACTUALLY, WE WERE JUST
CHECKING OUT AN INCIDENT

07:40.894 --> 07:42.095
WITH THE GIRL DOMINIQUE

07:42.129 --> 07:44.898
WHO DIDN'T MAKE THE RETURN
FLIGHT TO PARIS.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.700
UH, DID NICOLE MENTION IT?

07:46.734 --> 07:47.901
- SHE SLEPT ALL THE WAY HOME.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.837
- YOU SAW THAT FROM THE COCKPIT?

07:49.870 --> 07:52.506
NOW, YOU WERE IN THE CABIN
WITH HER.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.642
- SHE WAS REALLY UPSET
ABOUT DOMINIQUE.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.643
- REALLY?

07:55.676 --> 07:56.744
WHAT'D SHE SAY?

07:56.777 --> 07:59.046
- I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T ANSWER
ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS

07:59.079 --> 08:00.080
WITHOUT A LAWYER PRESENT.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.549
LET'S GO.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.717
- BUT WE'RE NOT CHARGING YOU
WITH ANYTHING.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.886
- YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO CHARGE US WITH.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.588
I'M SORRY, BUT THE TERMS
OF OUR EMPLOYMENT

08:07.621 --> 08:11.191
INCLUDE A CONFIDENTIALITY
AGREEMENT.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.127
- WELL, SO MUCH
FOR OUR STEALTH MISSION.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.229
HOW MUCH YOU WANNA BET
HER FIRST CALL IS TO HAYES?

08:16.263 --> 08:17.731
- WE NEED TO TALK
TO THE EX-GIRLFRIEND

08:17.765 --> 08:19.099
WHO FLEW OVER WITH HIM.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.870
- I JUST STARTED
MY OWN CLOTHING LINE,

08:22.903 --> 08:24.638
AND I WAS IN PARIS
FOR FASHION WEEK.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.006
JORDY LOANED ME HIS JET.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.941
- OKAY, AND THE TWO MODELS
WHO FLEW BACK WITH YOU,

08:27.975 --> 08:29.109
THEY WORK FOR YOU?

08:29.142 --> 08:30.844
- GOD, NO.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.746
- SO WHY WERE THEY ON THE PLANE?

08:32.780 --> 08:34.014
- JORDY CAN'T SAY NO.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.049
HIS FRIEND GERARD RUNS
A MODELING AGENCY,

08:36.083 --> 08:37.851
SO THEY HITCHED A RIDE.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.320
- OKAY, HOW'D THEY WIND UP AT
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S BIRTHDAY PARTY?

08:40.353 --> 08:41.922
- HE'S NOT MY BOYFRIEND.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.056
YOU CAN'T PUT MY NAME ON THAT.

08:43.090 --> 08:47.260
I AM NOT DESIGNING
FOR THE DENTURE SET.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.130
- DAHLIA, WE KNOW
YOU WERE AT THE PARTY.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.933
- OF COURSE I WAS.
EVERYONE WAS THERE.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.002
- INCLUDING THOSE TWO GIRLS.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.970
- THEIR JOB FELL THROUGH. THEY
DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE IN NEW YORK.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.138
I LET THEM TAG ALONG.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.973
- AND YOU INTRODUCED THEM
TO HAYES.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.775
- NO, I DITCHED THEM
THE SECOND I GOT THERE.

09:01.809 --> 09:04.011
OH, BORING!

09:04.044 --> 09:07.748
- OKAY, SO YOU DITCHED 'EM. WHEN
WAS THE NEXT TIME YOU SAW 'EM?

09:07.781 --> 09:10.851
- I WALKED IN ON NICOLE IN
THE POWDER ROOM, THROWING UP.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.052
GIRL CAN'T HOLD HER LIQUOR.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.721
- SHE'S 15.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.255
- SHE'S FRENCH.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.924
- SO WHAT'D YOU DO WITH HER?

09:16.957 --> 09:17.991
- I STUCK BOTH OF THEM
IN A BEDROOM.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.893
I TURNED ON THE T.V.,
I TOLD THEM TO CHILL OUT.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.128
- WHAT HAPPENED TO DOMINIQUE?

09:21.161 --> 09:24.131
- OH, I HEARD SHE GOT SICK, TOO.
WHO KNOWS WHAT SHE GOT INTO?

09:24.164 --> 09:27.735
- SHE WAS BLEEDING, AND SHE
SHOULD'VE GONE TO THE HOSPITAL.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.837
- AND WE TALKED TO THE DOCTOR
WHO PATCHED HER UP.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.005
- ARI TALKED TO YOU?

09:32.039 --> 09:33.841
- YEAH, NOW YOU'RE
GONNA TALK TO US,

09:33.874 --> 09:35.776
BECAUSE YOUR BOYFRIEND
RAPED THAT LITTLE GIRL.

09:35.809 --> 09:38.145
- THAT'S A LIE.
I WAS WITH HIM ALL NIGHT.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.681
- DAHLIA, WE HAVE HIS DNA.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.019
- I GOT NOTHING ELSE
TO SAY TO YOU.

09:46.053 --> 09:49.156
- AT LEAST NOW SHE THINKS
WE'VE GOT HAYES'S DNA.

09:49.189 --> 09:52.626
- AND WE HAVE THE DOCTOR'S
FIRST NAME.

09:52.660 --> 09:53.961
- YOU'RE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE,
ARI.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.195
- I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.030
- EXACTLY--I'M SURE
YOU'RE WELL AWARE

09:57.064 --> 09:58.966
OF THE MANDATORY REPORTING
STATUTES?

09:58.999 --> 10:00.668
- WHEN YOU TREAT A CHILD
FOR RAPE,

10:00.701 --> 10:02.035
YOU HAVE TO TELL
THE AUTHORITIES.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.805
- I DO ROUTINE PAP SMEARS
AND HYSTERECTOMIES.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.974
I HAVEN'T TREATED ANYONE
FOR RAPE.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.209
- REMEMBER HER?

10:09.242 --> 10:10.678
- NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.646
- JORDAN HAYES'S PARTY,
TWO NIGHTS AGO.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.947
- WE HAVE WITNESSES
THAT PUT YOU THERE.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.116
- MY WIFE SITS ON
A CHARITY BOARD WITH HIM.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.918
SHE WAS THE ONE WHO WAS INVITED.
SHE DRAGGED ME ALONG.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.920
- WHEN THEY ASKED IF THERE
WAS A DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE,

10:19.953 --> 10:20.854
YOU STEPPED UP.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.823
- WRONG. WE ONLY STAYED
FOR HALF AN HOUR.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.125
AND I CERTAINLY WOULD'VE
REMEMBERED DOING A PELVIC.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.127
- A DOCTOR NAMED ARI
TREATED HER.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.896
YOU'RE THE ONLY ARI
ON THE GUEST LIST.

10:28.929 --> 10:32.800
- BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY
ONE IN THE MEDICAL DIRECTORY.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.035
- IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE 52 ARIS
IN THIS CITY

10:35.068 --> 10:35.869
WITH AN M.D. AFTER THEIR NAMES.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.871
- ANY OF 'EM ON HAYES'S
SPEED DIAL?

10:37.905 --> 10:39.740
- WE GOT ENOUGH
TO DUMP HIS PHONES?

10:39.773 --> 10:41.909
- OLIVIA AND ELLIOT CORROBORATED
THE GIRL'S STORY

10:41.942 --> 10:42.976
RIGHT UP TO THE RAPE.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.411
CALL HARDWICK AND GET
A SUBPOENA.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.946
WHERE WE AT?

10:45.979 --> 10:48.181
- GETTING TO KNOW
JORDAN HAYES.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.884
HUMBLE BEGINNINGS,
SCHOLARSHIP TO M.I.T.,

10:50.918 --> 10:53.887
STARTED HIS OWN DEFENSE
CONTRACTING COMPANY,

10:53.921 --> 10:56.089
J.C.H. WORLDWIDE,
WHEN HE WAS 29.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.225
WITHIN A FEW YEARS,
MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.359
- OWNS HIS OWN ISLAND.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.261
- RECORD'S CLEAN, NO ARRESTS.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.863
- CONFIRMED BACHELOR,
HUGE PHILANTHROPIST.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.865
- HE'S A RAGING HYPOCHONDRIAC.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.968
SAYS HERE THAT HE WON'T
TRAVEL ANYWHERE

11:08.001 --> 11:12.706
WITHOUT HIS OWN PRIVATE
PHYSICIAN, ARI NATHAN.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.908
- YOU GOT AN ARI NATHAN
ON YOUR LIST?

11:14.942 --> 11:18.245
- WE GOT A PETERSEN, NUSSBAUM...
NO NATHAN.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.747
- CHECK WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.749
HE MUST BE LICENSED
IF HE PRACTICES IN NEW YORK.

11:21.782 --> 11:22.883
- I GOT HIM.

11:22.916 --> 11:26.053
HE'S A CONCIERGE DOCTOR.
HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE AN OFFICE.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.388
GUY ONLY MAKES HOUSE CALLS
TO THE FILTHY RICH.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.958
- GO PICK HIM UP.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.893
- GREAT, HOLLAND TUNNEL
AT RUSH HOUR.

11:32.926 --> 11:33.894
[elevator dings]

11:33.927 --> 11:35.128
- LIGHTS AND SIRENS?

11:35.162 --> 11:37.898
- EXCUSE ME, COULD YOU DIRECT ME
TO CAPTAIN CRAGEN'S OFFICE?

11:37.931 --> 11:43.303
- YES, IT'S, UH, RIGHT THIS WAY.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.972
- JORDAN HAYES, RIGHT?

11:45.005 --> 11:46.439
HERE TO TURN YOURSELF IN?

11:46.473 --> 11:48.842
- MR. HAYES IS HERE
TO FILE A COMPLAINT.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.110
- AGAINST WHO?

11:50.143 --> 11:51.478
- DOMINIC MOREAU.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.280
SHE RAPED ME.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.292
- NO DISRESPECT, BUT WHY ARE WE
TALKING TO YOU TWO?

12:05.325 --> 12:08.195
- WE WERE TOLD CAPTAIN CRAGEN
WOULD BE HANDLING THIS MATTER.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.329
- WELL, HE'S IN A MEETING

12:09.362 --> 12:10.764
WITH THE POLICE COMMISSIONER
RIGHT NOW.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.499
BUT YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO WAIT.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.267
- NOW, I KNOW THAT THIS IS HARD.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.203
UM, WOULD YOU FEEL
MORE COMFORTABLE

12:16.236 --> 12:17.270
WITH A MALE DETECTIVE?

12:17.304 --> 12:19.439
- CAN I JUST GET THIS
OVER WITH?

12:19.472 --> 12:21.374
- YEAH.
- OF COURSE.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.144
BUT YOU KNOW, YOU'LL HAVE TO
WALK US THROUGH EVERY DETAIL

12:24.177 --> 12:25.145
OF YOUR RAPE.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.180
- THIS IS NOT A JOKE, DETECTIVE.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.282
IS THIS THE WAY YOU TREAT
YOUR FEMALE ASSAULT VICTIMS?

12:29.316 --> 12:30.951
- NO DISRESPECT,

12:30.984 --> 12:32.452
BUT MOST VICTIMS DON'T
WALK IN LAWYERED UP.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.187
- I'M NOT MOST VICTIMS.

12:34.221 --> 12:37.024
[door clicks]

12:37.057 --> 12:38.491
- I'M SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

12:38.525 --> 12:39.592
- BEFORE YOU GET
TOO COMFORTABLE,

12:39.626 --> 12:42.195
CAPTAIN, CAN WE GO SOMEPLACE
A LITTLE MORE PRIVATE,

12:42.229 --> 12:43.296
LIKE YOUR OFFICE?

12:43.330 --> 12:46.033
- RIGHT THROUGH HERE.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.570
- I APPRECIATE YOUR COURTESY,
CAPTAIN.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.006
THEY TELL ME YOU WERE JUST
WITH EVAN.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.541
HOW IS THE POLICE COMMISSIONER?

12:54.574 --> 12:56.543
- WHILE WE'RE EXCHANGING
PLEASANTRIES,

12:56.576 --> 12:58.912
I'M REQUESTING THIS INTERVIEW
BE CONDUCTED

12:58.946 --> 13:00.914
UNDER A WAIVER OF IMMUNITY.

13:00.948 --> 13:03.350
- NICE TRY, BUT IF MR. HAYES
WANTS US TO TAKE HIS COMPLAINT,

13:03.383 --> 13:04.484
WE'LL TREAT HIM LIKE
ANY OTHER VICTIM.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.587
- UNLESS YOUR CLIENT PLANS
ON INCRIMINATING HIMSELF,

13:07.620 --> 13:09.556
IMMUNITY ISN'T NECESSARY.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.191
- FINE.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.459
SO HOW DO WE DO THIS?

13:12.492 --> 13:13.560
- WELL, FIRST WE NEED TO KNOW

13:13.593 --> 13:15.362
IF YOU SOUGHT MEDICAL
ATTENTION AFTER THE ATTACK.

13:15.395 --> 13:18.265
- MY PERSONAL PHYSICIAN
CHECKED ME FOR STDS.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.566
- WE'LL NEED THOSE RESULTS.

13:19.599 --> 13:20.600
- THAT'S PRIVILEGED.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.569
- I'LL SEE YOU GET WHATEVER
EVIDENCE YOU NEED.

13:22.602 --> 13:25.505
- TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.207
- [sighs]

13:27.240 --> 13:29.309
THE PARTY WAS IN FULL SWING.

13:29.342 --> 13:33.914
A FRIEND SAID THAT SHE WANTED
TO GIVE ME A SPECIAL PRESENT.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.615
TOLD ME TO WAIT
IN MY MASSAGE ROOM.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.417
- GUY HAS A MASSAGE ROOM.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.152
- I SUFFER FROM CHRONIC
BACK PAIN.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.021
THE THERAPEUTIC AND SPIRITUAL
BENEFITS OF MASSAGE--

13:41.054 --> 13:44.624
- UH, JORDAN, THAT'S NOT
GERMAINE TO THE INVESTIGATION.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.859
- YOU NEVER KNOW.
LET HIM SPEAK.

13:45.893 --> 13:48.161
- WHILE I WAS WAITING,

13:48.195 --> 13:50.397
I FELL ASLEEP.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.632
NOW...

13:52.665 --> 13:54.634
AT FIRST I THOUGHT
I MUST'VE BEEN DREAMING.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.203
- AND WHY IS THAT?

13:57.637 --> 13:59.907
- I WAS AROUSED.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.875
I...

14:01.909 --> 14:05.578
FELT MYSELF BEING MANUALLY
MANIPULATED.

14:05.612 --> 14:08.181
THEN I REMEMBERED,

14:08.215 --> 14:11.551
IT WAS MY PRESENT.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.487
I STARTED TO ENJOY MYSELF.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.056
BUT THEN...

14:16.089 --> 14:18.258
THEN IT GOT ROUGH.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.659
AND THAT'S WHEN I OPENED
MY EYES.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.161
- AND WHAT DID YOU SEE?

14:21.194 --> 14:22.930
- A WOMAN I'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

14:22.963 --> 14:23.931
- A WOMAN?

14:23.964 --> 14:26.433
DOMINIQUE MOREAU IS 12.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.068
- IT WAS DARK.
I JUST WANTED HER OFF ME.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.402
I TRIED TO STOP HER.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.038
- BUT THE 12-YEAR-OLD
OVERPOWERED YOU.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.140
- NO.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.909
SHE THREATENED ME.

14:35.943 --> 14:38.946
SHE SAID IF I DIDN'T LET HER...

14:38.979 --> 14:40.948
CONTINUE...

14:40.981 --> 14:42.582
SHE WAS GOING TO SCREAM RAPE.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.651
- AND THERE WAS NOTHING
THAT YOU COULD DO.

14:44.684 --> 14:47.487
YOU'VE GOT 40 YEARS AND
100 POUNDS ON THE GIRL.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.488
- DETECTIVE.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.457
- THE PARTY WAS GOING ON
RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR.

14:50.490 --> 14:53.660
I KNEW HOW THIS WAS GOING
TO LOOK.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.662
I WAS NAKED.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.564
SHE WAS NAKED.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.565
WHAT COULD I DO?

14:58.598 --> 15:00.333
- NOT HAVE SEX WITH A CHILD.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.936
- YOU SEEM TO FORGET OUR CLIENT
IS THE VICTIM HERE.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.612
- I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WENT
TO PICK UP THE DOCTOR.

15:12.645 --> 15:13.846
WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE?

15:13.880 --> 15:16.416
- LISTENING TO THE NEXT WINNER
OF LAST COMIC STANDING.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.118
- THIS GUY'S HILARIOUS.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.186
- LIV, FROM WHAT I COULD HEAR,

15:19.219 --> 15:20.687
YOU WEREN'T BUYING HIS CRAP
EITHER.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.222
- COME ON, HE'S ASKING FOR IT.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.958
- YOU GUYS NEED TO GO BACK
TO SENSITIVITY TRAINING.

15:38.138 --> 15:41.441
- THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.
I HAVEN'T SLEPT AT ALL.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.375
- MAYBE YOU NEED A MASSAGE.

15:42.409 --> 15:45.745
YOUR FRIEND EVER MAKE GOOD
ON THAT PRESENT?

15:45.778 --> 15:47.714
- I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO LET
ANYONE TOUCH ME

15:47.747 --> 15:49.416
SINCE THE INCIDENT.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.584
- WE'RE GONNA NEED THE NAME OF
THE WOMAN WHO STIFFED YOU.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.553
- ONE MORE UNPROFESSIONAL
COMMENT,

15:53.586 --> 15:55.055
I'M PULLING MY CLIENT
OUT OF HERE.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.689
- HE'S ONLY ASKING
FOR THE NAME OF THE WOMAN

15:56.723 --> 15:58.658
WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO PLEASURE HIM
IN THAT ROOM.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.593
- I WOULD PREFER TO KEEP HER
OUT OF THIS.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.595
- DO YOU WANT US
TO INVESTIGATE THIS OR NOT?

16:02.629 --> 16:05.598
- I THOUGHT CAPTAIN CRAGEN
WAS CONDUCTING THIS INTERVIEW.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.633
- I AM.

16:06.666 --> 16:10.170
AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED
THAT NAME.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.538
- DAHLIA JESSUP.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.273
- YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.642
THE ONE WHO BROUGHT DOMINIQUE
TO YOUR PARTY.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.244
- SPEAKING OF DOMINIQUE,

16:17.277 --> 16:19.679
NOW, YOU SAID THAT SHE
EXPLICITLY THREATENED YOU?

16:19.712 --> 16:20.613
- YES.

16:20.647 --> 16:24.117
- HOW IS THAT?
SHE DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.689
- HER EXACT WORDS WERE,

16:29.722 --> 16:31.758
"FAIS-MOI L'AMOUR OU
JE CRIE AU VIOL."

16:34.327 --> 16:35.628
- HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
HER INJURIES?

16:35.662 --> 16:37.697
- HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.
HE'S THE VICTIM HERE.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.766
- THEY WERE SEVERE ENOUGH
TO CALL A DOCTOR.

16:39.799 --> 16:40.867
YOUR OWN PRIVATE DOCTOR.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.170
- CAPTAIN, IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY,

16:43.203 --> 16:46.406
MAYBE THE POLICE COMMISSIONER
CAN FIND DETECTIVES WHO CAN.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.609
- WELL, THERE'S NO NEED
TO BOTHER THE COMMISSIONER.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.644
I ASSURE YOU, MR. STANDISH,

16:51.678 --> 16:54.347
THIS CASE WILL BE
THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED.

16:54.381 --> 16:57.584
- LET'S GO, JORDAN.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.652
- IF IT HADN'T HAPPENED TO ME,

16:59.686 --> 17:01.521
I WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT EITHER.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.529
- I TRUST YOU'LL HANDLE
THIS MATTER

17:09.562 --> 17:13.166
WITH THE CUSTOMARY DISCRETION
AFFORDED ALL RAPE VICTIMS.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.202
MAKE SURE HIS NAME ISN'T LEAKED
TO THE MEDIA.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.471
- WELL, CAPTAIN,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

17:18.505 --> 17:20.807
- IT'S A NEW TWIST
ON HE SAID/SHE SAID.

17:20.840 --> 17:21.808
THEY COULDN'T HAVE BOTH
BEEN RAPED.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.543
- I KNOW WHICH ONE IS LYING.

17:23.576 --> 17:26.146
- WELL, AT THIS POINT, THE ONLY
PERSON I'M PREPARED TO ARREST

17:26.179 --> 17:28.181
IS HAYES'S DOCTOR.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.585
- I TOLD YOU ON THE PHONE,

17:32.619 --> 17:34.487
HE SEES HIS TRAINER EVERY DAY
AT NOON.

17:34.521 --> 17:35.588
- WE CHECKED. HE WASN'T THERE.

17:35.622 --> 17:38.291
- HIS TRAINER SAID HE GOT CALLED
AWAY ON AN EMERGENCY

17:38.325 --> 17:39.592
IN THE MIDDLE OF
HIS SQUAT THRUSTS.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.661
DID THAT EMERGENCY CALL
HAPPEN TO COME FROM YOU?

17:41.694 --> 17:43.330
- NO. A PATIENT MUST'VE
CALLED HIM DIRECTLY.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.331
- WHO?

17:44.364 --> 17:45.865
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.435
- YOU'RE HIS ASSISTANT. YOU HAVE
TO KNOW WHICH PATIENTS TO BILK.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.570
- I CAN'T DISCUSS DR. NATHAN'S
PATIENTS WITH YOU.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.871
- LISTEN, WE COULD CARE LESS

17:51.904 --> 17:54.174
ABOUT WHO HE'S GIVING
EMERGENCY BOTOX TO,

17:54.207 --> 17:55.308
WE JUST WANNA TALK TO HIM.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.776
- WELL, IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE
YOUR CARD,

17:56.809 --> 17:59.846
I'LL MAKE SURE HE CALLS YOU BACK
AT HIS EARLIEST CONVENIENCE.

17:59.879 --> 18:03.550
- DON'T MAKE US CHARGE YOU
WITH OBSTRUCTION.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.285
- [sighs]

18:05.318 --> 18:08.355
HE'S AT 352 PRINCE. PENTHOUSE.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.323
PROMISE YOU WON'T BOTHER
THE PATIENT.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.559
- MUM'S THE WORD.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.660
- YOU RECOGNIZE THAT ADDRESS?

18:13.693 --> 18:14.894
- SHOULD I?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.329
- DAHLIA JESSUP.

18:16.363 --> 18:17.897
- JORDAN HAYES'S GIRLFRIEND?

18:17.930 --> 18:20.567
- SHE'S THE ONE WHO BROUGHT
OUR VICTIM TO HIS PARTY.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.602
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER,
DR. NATHAN?

18:22.635 --> 18:24.537
- I'M WITH A PATIENT.

18:24.571 --> 18:25.905
GET OUT OF HERE.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.874
- AFTER EVERYTHING WE WENT
THROUGH TO FIND YOU,

18:27.907 --> 18:29.142
I DON'T THINK SO.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.378
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY BEDROOM?

18:31.411 --> 18:32.879
- YOUR ASSISTANT LET US IN.

18:32.912 --> 18:33.880
- TELL HER SHE'S FIRED.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.282
- SHE O.D.?

18:35.315 --> 18:37.350
- ACCIDENTAL.
THEY'RE ALL PRESCRIPTION.

18:37.384 --> 18:38.385
- WRITTEN BY YOU.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.819
- SVU PORTABLE TO CENTRAL.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.588
NEED A BUS AT 352 PRINCE STREET.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.423
PENTHOUSE LOFT.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.657
- THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.
SHE'S STABLE NOW.

18:44.691 --> 18:45.725
AND I'LL STAY WITH HER.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.194
- NO, YOU WON'T.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.595
- YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY

18:48.628 --> 18:51.431
WITH MANDATORY REPORTING LAWS.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.333
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT...

18:56.269 --> 18:57.737
- I SAW NO SIGNS
THAT GIRL WAS RAPED.

18:57.770 --> 19:00.407
- JORDAN ALREADY ADMITTED
THE TWO OF THEM HAD SEX.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.941
- I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.411
- SO YOU ADMIT YOU TREATED HER.

19:04.444 --> 19:05.945
- THAT'S PRIVILEGED.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.181
- PRIVILEGED?

19:08.215 --> 19:10.383
LITTLE SLAP ON THE WRIST YOU'RE
GONNA GET FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD

19:10.417 --> 19:13.386
IS NOTHIN' COMPARED TO WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU IN PRISON.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.324
- JORDAN SAID THERE WAS
A PROBLEM WITH A GIRL

19:17.357 --> 19:18.625
WHO CRASHED HIS PARTY.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.560
- SHE WAS BLEEDING INTERNALLY.

19:20.593 --> 19:23.830
- THE MEDICAL TERM IS MENSES.
SHE GOT HER PERIOD.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.366
- WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR
MEDICAL DEGREE, THE INTERNET?

19:26.399 --> 19:28.368
- SHE PRESENTED WITH SEVERE
ABDOMINAL PAIN AND BLEEDING.

19:28.401 --> 19:31.504
I GAVE HER AN IBUPROFEN
AND A TAMPON.

19:31.538 --> 19:34.374
- THAT'S ALL YOU DID AFTER
SHE TOLD YOU SHE WAS RAPED?

19:34.407 --> 19:35.475
- SHE DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.676
WE HAD COMMUNICATION ISSUES.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.345
I DON'T SPEAK FRENCH.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.579
- BUT YOU'RE FLUENT IN BULL.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.381
- HE'S NOT BUDGING
OFF THAT STORY.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.682
- HAYES GOT TO EVERYONE.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.252
- SOMEONE'S GOTTA HAVE
A CONSCIENCE.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.653
- WHAT ABOUT DAHLIA?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.555
DO YOU THINK THAT WAS
AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE?

19:48.588 --> 19:49.656
OR WAS IT GUILT?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.358
- SHE'S DEFINITELY A PARTY GIRL.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.626
- WELL, IT'S SUSPICIOUS TIMING.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.262
YOU KNOW, WE NEVER DID ASK HER

19:55.295 --> 19:56.396
WHAT SHE GOT HAYES
FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.

19:56.429 --> 19:59.332
- MAYBE SHE FOUND THE PERFECT
LITTLE GIFT IN PARIS.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.300
- AND BROUGHT IT HOME
ON THE PLANE.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.302
- AND LEFT IT FOR HIM
IN HIS MASSAGE ROOM.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.836
- COULD SHE REALLY BE
THAT DEPRAVED?

20:03.870 --> 20:04.904
SHE WAS HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.673
- OR SO SHE KEEPS CLAIMING.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.276
- WE KNOW THAT SHE LIED
WHEN SHE ALIBI'D HIM.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.877
HE ADMITS TO HAVING SEX
WITH THE GIRL.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.380
- SHE LIED BECAUSE SHE'S
INVOLVED.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.881
- WE'VE BEEN BREATHING
DOWN HER NECK.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.250
IF I WAS GUILTY
OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING,

20:17.284 --> 20:19.619
I'D POP A FEW DOZEN PILLS TOO.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.890
- I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO YOU.

20:23.923 --> 20:29.296
- DAHLIA, YOU TRIED
TO KILL YOURSELF.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.964
- YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
JUST GO AWAY.

20:31.998 --> 20:35.034
- YOU COULDN'T LIVE
WITH WHAT YOU DID TO THAT GIRL?

20:35.067 --> 20:36.002
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

20:36.035 --> 20:38.538
- COME ON, YOU WERE
ON THE PLANE WITH HER,

20:38.571 --> 20:41.274
YOU TOOK HER TO THE PARTY,
I MEAN, YOU SET HER UP.

20:41.308 --> 20:42.409
- WHAT?

20:42.442 --> 20:45.044
- YOU ASKED JORDAN TO WAIT
IN THE MASSAGE ROOM NAKED

20:45.077 --> 20:46.346
FOR A PRESENT.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.315
BUT YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP.

20:48.348 --> 20:51.050
- I--I DID. BUT THE DOOR WAS
LOCKED. I COULDN'T GET IN.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.286
- RIGHT, HE WAS ALREADY
UNWRAPPING YOUR GIFT.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.855
- SO WHAT DO YOU GET FOR THE MAN
WHO HAS EVERYTHING?

20:55.888 --> 20:57.557
- A 12-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN?

20:57.590 --> 21:00.493
- SO, THIS IS YOU TAKING MY CASE
SERIOUSLY.

21:00.527 --> 21:01.728
- JORDY.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.463
- HOW YOU FEELING, BABE?

21:03.496 --> 21:05.965
- WELL ENOUGH TO STICK
TO YOUR SCRIPT.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.900
- I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.636
- YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO HIDE.

21:09.669 --> 21:12.305
I WANT YOU TO COOPERATE FULLY.

21:12.339 --> 21:17.043
ASK HER ANYTHING YOU LIKE,
DETECTIVES.

21:17.076 --> 21:18.811
- WE ALMOST HAD HER,
AND THEN JORDAN WALKED IN.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.880
- I SWEAR THIS GUY'S HAVING US
FOLLOWED.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.315
- WE GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS.

21:22.349 --> 21:24.050
PARIS IS CALLING.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.719
- DOMINIQUE STILL REFUSES
TO COOPERATE.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.321
BUT WE DID LOCATE A WITNESS.

21:28.355 --> 21:30.457
[speaking French]

21:30.490 --> 21:31.891
- NICOLE?

21:31.924 --> 21:33.593
YOU WERE ON THE PLANE
WITH DOMINIQUE.

21:33.626 --> 21:34.827
- AND AT THE PARTY.

21:34.861 --> 21:37.330
- CAN YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED?

21:37.364 --> 21:38.865
- WE GOT BORED
STUCK IN THAT ROOM.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.968
WE DID NOT GO TO NEW YORK TO BE
TREATED LIKE CHILDREN.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.070
- OKAY.

21:44.103 --> 21:45.472
WHAT'D YOU DO?

21:45.505 --> 21:46.973
- WE EXPLORED THE HOUSE.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.409
THERE WAS A ROOM WITH CANDLES.

21:49.442 --> 21:52.479
AND A NAKED MAN ASLEEP
ON A TABLE.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.481
HE WAS THE HOST.

21:54.514 --> 21:56.516
THIS MAN.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.017
- JORDAN HAYES.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.085
- OUI.

21:59.118 --> 22:02.989
I TRY TO CLOSE THE DOOR
BUT DOMINIQUE WENT INSIDE.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.457
- WHY?

22:04.491 --> 22:07.960
- BECAUSE HE IS A BILLIONAIRE.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.863
SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING
TO GET RICH.

22:19.872 --> 22:20.840
- NO WAY THIS IS
A PRIVATE RESIDENCE.

22:20.873 --> 22:23.710
- I READ THAT JORDAN PAID
50 MILLION FOR IT.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.445
- WELL, HOW MUCH YOU THINK
HE PAID NICOLE

22:25.478 --> 22:26.379
TO BACK UP HIS STORY?

22:26.413 --> 22:29.749
- THE QUESTION IS,
DID HE GET TO DOMINIQUE?

22:29.782 --> 22:31.718
- EITHER WAY, WE'VE GOT UGATZ.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.553
- UNLESS WE EXTRADITE HER.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.388
AT LEAST SHE'D BE BACK
IN OUR JURISDICTION.

22:35.422 --> 22:37.890
- FRANCE WOULDN'T GIVE US
ROMAN POLANSKI.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.025
WHY WOULD THEY HAND OVER

22:39.058 --> 22:41.828
A 12-YEAR-OLD FEMALE
ALLEGED RAPIST?

22:41.861 --> 22:44.531
- THERE'S NO WAY THAT THIS WAS
A ONE-TIME BIRTHDAY WISH.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.132
THERE'S GOTTA BE OTHER VICTIMS.

22:46.165 --> 22:48.468
- IF HE'S BRINGING IN JAILBAIT,
THE HELP'S GOTTA KNOW.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.837
- SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD TO GET
AN EMPLOYEE LIST.

22:50.870 --> 22:54.474
I SAY WE HOLD OFF ON TALKING
TO JORDY TILL WE INTERVIEW THEM.

22:54.507 --> 22:57.777
[knocking]

22:57.810 --> 22:59.446
- HOWDY.

22:59.479 --> 23:00.480
- DETECTIVES.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.148
YOU MUST BE FREEZING.

23:02.181 --> 23:04.417
YOU'VE BEEN SITTING OUT HERE
FOR HALF AN HOUR.

23:04.451 --> 23:06.686
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME INSIDE?

23:06.719 --> 23:08.821
- I SEE YOU LIKE NUDES.

23:08.855 --> 23:11.458
- I APPRECIATE THE FEMALE FORM.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.025
NEXT TIME YOU'RE IN LONDON

23:13.059 --> 23:15.562
YOU SHOULD SEE THE BRONZES
I LOANED TO THE BRITISH MUSEUM.

23:15.595 --> 23:16.763
- WELL, I'LL TELL YA WHAT,

23:16.796 --> 23:18.130
I'LL MAKE IT A POINT
TO STOP BY

23:18.164 --> 23:19.699
ON MY WAY BACK FROM FRANCE.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.200
- ANY NEW DEVELOPMENTS
ON MY CASE?

23:21.233 --> 23:23.803
- YOUR STORY SEEMS TO BE
CHECKING OUT.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.672
IT WOULD REALLY HELP US

23:25.705 --> 23:29.609
IF YOU'D WALK US
THROUGH THE CRIME SCENE.

23:29.642 --> 23:30.677
- RIGHT THIS WAY.

23:39.752 --> 23:40.987
- WE COME AT A BAD TIME?

23:41.020 --> 23:42.922
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE SETTING UP
FOR A MASSAGE.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.591
- THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.

23:44.624 --> 23:47.193
- YOU KNOW, MY BACK HAS BEEN
BOTHERING ME A LOT LATELY.

23:47.226 --> 23:48.394
DO YOU HAVE YOUR GIRL'S CARD?

23:48.427 --> 23:51.464
- I'M AFRAID SHE'S NOT TAKING ON
ANY NEW CLIENTS RIGHT NOW.

23:51.498 --> 23:52.832
- MAYBE SHE COULD
SQUEEZE HIM IN.

23:52.865 --> 23:55.568
- NO OFFENSE,
BUT YOU CAN'T AFFORD HER.

23:55.602 --> 23:56.603
- HMM.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.238
- SO, WHAT DO YOU WATCH...

23:59.271 --> 24:01.007
WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A RUBDOWN?

24:06.112 --> 24:07.880
- REALLY?

24:11.718 --> 24:15.988
- PEOPLE SEE ME AS
A WINNING LOTTERY TICKET.

24:16.022 --> 24:18.591
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY I NEED
TO RECORD MY MASSAGES.

24:18.625 --> 24:21.193
- SO YOU HAVE YOUR ASSAULT
ON TAPE.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.261
- UNFORTUNATELY NOT.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.563
AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE,

24:23.596 --> 24:25.598
I WAS EXPECTING
A MASSAGE FROM A FRIEND.

24:25.632 --> 24:27.567
I SAW NO REASON
TO RECORD THAT ONE.
- MR. HAYES?

24:27.600 --> 24:31.571
AH. IT'S TIME
FOR MY APPOINTMENT.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.606
LET ME SHOW YOU OUT.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.514
- WE NEED A WARRANT
FOR THOSE TAPES.

24:41.548 --> 24:44.116
- WHAT TAPES? ALL THEY SAW WAS
A CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISION.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.186
- HAYES TOLD THEM THAT HE
RECORDED ALL HIS MASSAGES.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.522
I'M BETTING WE FIND
MORE UNDER AGED GIRLS.

24:49.556 --> 24:50.757
- WITH ALL THE HEAT ON HIM,

24:50.790 --> 24:52.291
DON'T YOU THINK
HE'S ERASED THEM BY NOW?

24:52.324 --> 24:54.627
- NO, NOT THIS GUY. HE DOESN'T
THINK ANYBODY CAN TOUCH HIM.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.062
- YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T USE
A WARRANT

24:56.095 --> 24:57.196
FOR A FISHING EXPEDITION.

24:57.229 --> 25:01.668
- WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT HE HAD
SEX WITH A 12-YEAR-OLD.

25:01.701 --> 25:02.669
THAT IS UNDISPUTED.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.270
- HE SAYS IT WASN'T TAPED.

25:04.303 --> 25:06.005
- AND I SAY THE PERVERT
IS LYING HIS ASS OFF.

25:06.038 --> 25:08.675
- PERVERT ALSO MAKES GOOD
ON HIS BRIBES.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.242
GUESS WHO JUST SIGNED
A SLICK DEAL

25:10.276 --> 25:13.846
TO BECOME THE NEW FACE
FOR BELLE FAUX COSMETICS?

25:13.880 --> 25:17.249
- NICOLE IS THE GIRL WHO WAS
WITH DOMINIQUE AT THE PARTY.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.986
SHE BACKED UP JORDAN'S CLAIM
THAT HE WAS SET UP.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.187
- INTERESTING TIMING.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.289
- CAN'T WE GET HIM
FOR WITNESS TAMPERING?

25:23.322 --> 25:25.257
- WE'D NEED HIS FINANCIALS
TO SHOW A DIRECT LINK.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.325
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND ONE.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.794
SHE WAS MANAGED
BY HAYES'S FRIEND.

25:27.827 --> 25:30.296
- THEN THE EVIDENCE IS, AT BEST,
CIRCUMSTANTIAL.

25:30.329 --> 25:32.298
- AND IN FRENCH.
WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS?

25:32.331 --> 25:34.133
- MUNCH HAS BEEN WORKING
HIS PARIS ANGLE.

25:34.166 --> 25:37.203
- HEY, WHAT'S THE FRENCH WORD
FOR BARF?

25:37.236 --> 25:40.239
IT'S SHOCKING HOW EASY IT IS
FOR A MAN OF A CERTAIN AGE

25:40.272 --> 25:42.308
TO FRIEND A TWEEN
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

25:42.341 --> 25:45.578
- MUNCH AND DOMINIQUE
HAVE BECOME FACEUNION FRIENDS.

25:45.612 --> 25:46.512
- EXCEPT SHE THINKS
SHE'S CHATTING

25:46.545 --> 25:48.147
WITH ANOTHER 12-YEAR-OLD
SEX ABUSE VICTIM.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.749
- NAMED GIGI ALVAREZ.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.083
- THAT'S ME ON THE RIGHT.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.019
- YOU'RE NOT PUTTING WORDS
IN HER MOUTH ARE YOU?

25:53.052 --> 25:55.021
- GIGI HAS SIMPLY BEEN
ENCOURAGING DOMINIQUE

25:55.054 --> 25:56.355
TO BLOG ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.990
- THE RAPE WAS PRETTY BRUTAL.

25:58.024 --> 26:00.126
- I JUST TOLD HER THAT AFTER
GIGI TESTIFIED

26:00.159 --> 26:02.361
AGAINST HER RAPIST IN COURT
AND HE WENT TO JAIL,

26:02.394 --> 26:04.096
THE NIGHTMARES ENDED.

26:04.130 --> 26:05.364
- WHAT DID SHE JUST SAY?

26:05.397 --> 26:08.300
- "THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE MY BIG BREAK.

26:08.334 --> 26:10.236
"NOW I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO GET OUT OF BED.

26:10.269 --> 26:13.005
I'M AFRAID TO LEAVE THE HOUSE."

26:13.039 --> 26:15.341
- HAVE YOU CONVINCED HER
TO FILE CHARGES?

26:15.374 --> 26:16.375
- I'M WORKING ON IT.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.077
- EVEN IF SHE DOES COME FORWARD,

26:18.110 --> 26:20.379
WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE THAN
HER TESTIMONY TO PUT HIM AWAY.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.649
- THE BEST WAY
TO CONVINCE A JURY

26:22.682 --> 26:24.751
IS WITH AN ACTUAL VIDEO
OF THE CRIME.

26:24.784 --> 26:27.319
YOU'VE GOT TO GET US
THAT SEARCH WARRANT.

26:27.353 --> 26:30.356
- JUDGE MIRANSKI'S HEARING
WARRANT PETITIONS.

26:30.389 --> 26:33.592
I'VE GOT A GOOD TRACK RECORD
GETTING WHAT I WANT FROM HIM.

26:35.762 --> 26:39.031
- MS. HARDWICKE. ALWAYS A
PLEASURE. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

26:39.065 --> 26:41.000
- ROUTINE SEARCH WARRANT
APPLICATION.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.235
- EXCELLENT. LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

26:47.339 --> 26:49.375
JORDAN HAYES.

26:49.408 --> 26:50.542
- YOUR HONOR, WE BELIEVE
HE'S IN POSSESSION

26:50.576 --> 26:54.180
OF DIGITAL RECORDINGS THAT
DEPICT THE RAPE OF A MINOR.

26:54.213 --> 26:55.748
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBABLE CAUSE?

26:55.782 --> 26:57.149
- DETECTIVE TUTUOLA?

26:57.183 --> 26:59.686
- THE TARGET ADMITTED TO
ROUTINELY RECORDING EVENTS

26:59.719 --> 27:02.421
THAT TAKE PLACE IN HIS MASSAGE
ROOM, WHERE THE RAPE OCCURRED.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.356
- AND YOU PERSONALLY HAVE
KNOWLEDGE OF THIS?

27:04.390 --> 27:06.125
- I WAS INFORMED
BY MY FELLOW DETECTIVES.

27:06.158 --> 27:08.127
- AND THE CHILD?

27:08.160 --> 27:10.196
SHE TOLD YOU THAT THE INCIDENT
WAS RECORDED?

27:10.229 --> 27:13.299
- SHE'S UNAVAILABLE
AT THIS TIME.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.134
- DID YOU OR YOUR FELLOW
OFFICERS

27:15.167 --> 27:17.069
WATCH ANY OF THE RECORDINGS?

27:17.103 --> 27:18.170
- NO, JUDGE.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.839
- THEN WHY DO YOU BELIEVE
IT EXISTS?

27:19.872 --> 27:22.208
- LIKE I TOLD YOU,
HAYES RECORDS ALL THE MASSAGES

27:22.241 --> 27:23.342
IN THAT ROOM
WHERE THE CHILD WAS RAPED.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.144
- SEEMS TO ME
LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE

27:25.177 --> 27:26.278
ALL YOUR DUCKS IN A ROW,
DETECTIVE.

27:26.312 --> 27:29.081
YOU'RE MERELY GUESSING
THAT SUCH A RECORDING EXISTS.

27:29.115 --> 27:30.917
COME BACK
WHEN YOU HAVE KNOWLEDGE

27:30.950 --> 27:31.851
THAT THE INCIDENT
WAS MEMORIALIZED.

27:31.884 --> 27:34.186
- BUT YOUR HONOR,
THE LAW ONLY REQUIRES

27:34.220 --> 27:37.023
RELIABILITY OF INFORMATION
AND THE BASIS FOR KNOWLEDGE

27:37.056 --> 27:37.990
TO SATISFY PROBABLE CAUSE.

27:38.024 --> 27:39.692
- COUNSELOR, I KNOW
WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.293
AND YOU DON'T HAVE IT YET.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.195
NEXT CASE.

27:43.229 --> 27:46.098
- HAYES PROBABLY FINANCED
HIS LAST ELECTION CAMPAIGN.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.300
- YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY
TO MY FACE, DETECTIVE?

27:48.334 --> 27:51.337
- HE DOES NOT, YOUR HONOR.

27:54.273 --> 27:55.775
[door shuts]

27:55.808 --> 27:57.744
- WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE?

27:57.777 --> 28:00.412
- TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER WAY
TO GET AT JORDAN HAYES.

28:00.446 --> 28:01.680
JUDGE MIRANSKI
DENIED THE WARRANT.

28:01.714 --> 28:05.284
- I KNOW. I HEARD FIN ALMOST GOT
SLAPPED WITH CONTEMPT OF COURT.

28:05.317 --> 28:06.285
- YEAH, IT MAKES YOU WONDER.

28:06.318 --> 28:07.419
IS MIRANSKI IN HIS POCKET, TOO?

28:07.453 --> 28:08.687
- NO.

28:08.721 --> 28:11.157
- WELL, CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS
ARE A MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.424
AND THAT'S WHY I'M CHECKING--

28:12.458 --> 28:15.394
- LIV, LIV, HARDWICKE SAID
FROM THE GET-GO

28:15.427 --> 28:17.263
WE NEEDED MORE EVIDENCE, OKAY?

28:17.296 --> 28:18.798
WE ROLLED THE DICE; WE LOST.

28:18.831 --> 28:21.367
- THERE'S GOTTA BE ANOTHER WAY
TO GET AT HAYES.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.102
DOMINIQUE IS NOT GONNA BE
HIS LAST VICTIM.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.804
- IT'S LATE.

28:24.837 --> 28:27.439
AND I DON'T THINK ANY YOUNG
GIRLS ARE IN DANGER TONIGHT.

28:27.473 --> 28:28.574
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

28:28.607 --> 28:32.879
- I HAVE A PATROL CAR STATIONED
OUTSIDE HIS PLACE, OKAY?

28:32.912 --> 28:34.781
GO HOME.

28:34.814 --> 28:38.785
WE'LL GET A FRESH START
IN THE MORNING.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.119
- EXCUSE ME.

28:40.152 --> 28:43.756
THEY TOLD ME DOWNSTAIRS
TO TALK TO DETECTIVE BENSON?

28:43.790 --> 28:45.024
- WELL, THIS IS HER RIGHT HERE.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.960
- HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

28:47.994 --> 28:51.397
- A FRIEND OF MINE SENT ME
A LINK TO THIS GIRL'S BLOG.

28:51.430 --> 28:54.400
DOMINIQUE MOREAU?

28:54.433 --> 28:56.535
- YOU READ ABOUT HER RAPE.

28:56.568 --> 29:00.807
- YEAH.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.976
I'VE BEEN IN THAT MASSAGE ROOM.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.047
- HEY, GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
LET'S GO.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.148
- NEW CASE?

29:09.181 --> 29:10.950
- UH, EIGHT TO BE EXACT.
AND COUNTING.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.018
- WHAT HAPPENED?

29:12.051 --> 29:14.353
- YOUR PARTNER CRACKED
THE HAYES CASE WIDE OPEN.

29:14.386 --> 29:15.354
- HOW?

29:15.387 --> 29:16.522
- DOMINIQUE'S BLOG WENT VIRAL.

29:16.555 --> 29:18.090
THE LEDGER PICKED IT UP.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.325
DIDN'T YOU READ THE PAPER TODAY?

29:19.358 --> 29:20.326
- I WAS RUNNING LATE.

29:20.359 --> 29:21.393
- LIV, RIGHT HERE.

29:21.427 --> 29:24.096
GRAB YOUR PAD. I NEED YOU
TO TAKE SOME STATEMENTS.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.331
RIGHT THIS WAY, YOUNG LADY.

29:25.364 --> 29:28.868
- THE WOMAN WHO HOOKED ME UP
WITH HIM NEVER TOLD ME HER NAME.

29:28.901 --> 29:31.270
- I WANT YOU TO TAKE
A LOOK AT THESE PHOTOS

29:31.303 --> 29:33.772
AND TELL ME IF YOU
RECOGNIZE ANYBODY.

29:40.246 --> 29:41.580
- THAT'S HER.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.283
- DAHLIA.
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW HER?

29:44.316 --> 29:47.386
- SHE'S THE ONE WHO ASKED ME IF
I WANTED TO MAKE SOME FAST CASH.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.121
- HOW?

29:49.155 --> 29:51.891
- SHE SAID ALL I HAD TO DO
WAS GIVE HIM A MASSAGE.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.893
- AND DID YOU?

29:53.926 --> 29:56.328
- WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
HE'D BE TOTALLY NAKED.

29:56.362 --> 29:59.231
BUT I REALLY WANTED
THIS DRESS FOR HOMECOMING.

29:59.265 --> 30:01.400
SO I ASKED HIM WHERE
HE WANTED ME TO START.

30:01.433 --> 30:04.270
AND HE TOLD ME
TO TAKE MY SHIRT OFF.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.306
- AND WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

30:07.339 --> 30:08.474
- I WAS DOWN
TO MY BRA AND PANTIES,

30:08.507 --> 30:10.242
AND HE STARTED
TOUCHING HIMSELF.

30:10.276 --> 30:11.844
GROSS.

30:11.878 --> 30:14.313
THEN HE STARTED TOUCHING ME.

30:14.346 --> 30:15.614
- WHERE?

30:15.647 --> 30:17.316
- MY BOOB.

30:17.349 --> 30:20.319
HE PUT HIS HAND
DOWN MY PANTIES.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.354
THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE
IN THE HOUSE.

30:22.388 --> 30:25.491
I KEPT THINKING SOMEONE WOULD
COME IN AND STOP IT.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.426
- I KNOW OTHER KIDS IN MY CLASS
HAVE DONE IT...

30:27.459 --> 30:28.460
[sniffles]

30:28.494 --> 30:31.197
BUT I WAS STILL A VIRGIN.

30:31.230 --> 30:34.133
- WHY DIDN'T YOU REPORT HIM?

30:34.166 --> 30:36.402
- I DIDN'T EXACTLY SAY "NO."

30:36.435 --> 30:39.906
WHEN IT WAS FINALLY OVER,

30:39.939 --> 30:43.309
I GRABBED MY STUFF
AND I RAN OUT CRYING.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.377
- DID ANYONE SEE YOU?

30:45.411 --> 30:48.180
- I WAS PUTTING ON MY CLOTHES
IN THE HALLWAY.

30:48.214 --> 30:52.251
THE HOUSE MANAGER GAVE ME
MY 500 BUCKS.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.186
I TOOK IT.

30:54.220 --> 30:57.556
- DID HE SAY ANYTHING TO YOU?

30:57.589 --> 31:02.194
- HE ASKED IF I HAD ANY FRIENDS
AS CUTE AS ME.

31:02.228 --> 31:03.629
- OKAY, THEN WHAT DID YOU
TELL HIM?

31:03.662 --> 31:07.366
- I SENT MY FRIEND TINA.

31:07.399 --> 31:10.937
HE DID THE EXACT SAME
THING TO HER.

31:10.970 --> 31:13.205
AM I GONNA BE IN TROUBLE?

31:13.239 --> 31:15.607
- NO, YOU'RE 14.

31:15.641 --> 31:18.044
HE'S THE ONE WHO'S GONNA BE
IN TROUBLE.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.980
OKAY, NOW I NEED YOU TO LOOK AT
THESE PHOTOS ONE AT A TIME,

31:21.013 --> 31:23.082
AND TELL ME IF YOU SEE HIM.

31:30.256 --> 31:31.390
- THIS IS HIM.

31:31.423 --> 31:34.093
HIS NAME IS JORDAN HAYES.

31:34.126 --> 31:38.464
HE'S THE MAN WHO PAID ME
TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.537
- DID YOU GET
THE SEARCH WARRANT?

31:45.571 --> 31:48.307
- JUDGE MIRANSKI WAS ONLY
TOO HAPPY TO SIGN THIS ONE.

31:48.340 --> 31:49.575
HERE'S A COPY
IF THEY GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.310
- BE CAREFUL NOT
TO BREAK ANYTHING.

31:51.343 --> 31:52.611
WOULDN'T WANT MR. HAYES
TO BE UPSET.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.046
IF YOU EVER GET OUT.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.282
- MY LAWYERS WILL HAVE ME OUT
IN AN HOUR.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.284
I'VE ALREADY PUT A CALL IN
TO THE D.A.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.685
- IN MY EXPERIENCE
WITH PEDOPHILES,

31:59.718 --> 32:01.453
GOOD FRIENDS CAN'T ABANDON YOU
QUICK ENOUGH.

32:01.487 --> 32:04.056
- AND HOW FAST DO YOU THINK
YOUR STAFF'S GONNA TURN ON YOU

32:04.090 --> 32:06.092
ONCE THEY'RE FACING JAIL TIME?

32:06.125 --> 32:07.726
GOOD HELP'S SO HARD TO FIND.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.329
- I HAVE A MASSAGE APPOINTMENT
AT 4:00.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.364
I DON'T INTEND TO MISS IT.

32:19.471 --> 32:20.472
- HEY MONEYBAGS,

32:20.506 --> 32:22.674
YOU MIGHT JUST GET
THAT 4:00 MASSAGE OF YOURS.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.376
ERNEST HERE--

32:24.410 --> 32:29.248
HE'S GOT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE
WITH INAPPROPRIATE TOUCHING.

32:29.281 --> 32:32.318
- IT HAS BEEN A BLEAK LIFE.

32:32.351 --> 32:33.986
SO GOOD TO MAKE
YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.387
- WHY AM I STILL HERE?

32:35.421 --> 32:37.089
- ASK YOUR LAWYER.

32:37.123 --> 32:38.524
THEY'RE THE ONES INSISTING
WE KEEP YOU OUT OF THE SYSTEM

32:38.557 --> 32:41.227
UNTIL THEY WORK OUT
YOUR V.I.P. PROCESSING.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.628
- IS THAT CASHMERE?

32:42.661 --> 32:44.063
- TOUCH ME AGAIN
AND YOU'LL BE PICKING

32:44.096 --> 32:45.297
YOUR NOSE OUT OF YOUR BRAIN.

32:45.331 --> 32:47.466
- AH-AH-AH, JUST BE ANOTHER
CHARGE TO ADD TO THE INDICTMENT.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.701
- I DEMAND A PRIVATE CELL.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.237
- REALLY.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.439
WELL, I WANT A PRIVATE ISLAND.

32:53.472 --> 32:56.575
- EL, WHERE CAN I PUT
HAYES'S HOUSE MANAGER?

32:56.608 --> 32:58.144
- ONE'S OPEN.

32:58.177 --> 33:00.479
- SIR, THEY'VE TORN
THE ENTIRE HOUSE TO SHREDS.

33:00.512 --> 33:03.282
- IT'S OKAY, GILES.
THIS TOO SHALL PASS.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.350
- I DOUBT IT.

33:04.383 --> 33:06.552
AND REMEMBER, THE FOOLISH
SAYINGS OF A RICH MAN

33:06.585 --> 33:09.588
PASS FOR WISE ONES.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.090
YOU'RE A PIMP.

33:11.123 --> 33:13.259
- I RUN HIS HOUSEHOLD.
NOT HIS PERSONAL LIFE.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.061
- YOU KEEP HIS SOCIAL CALENDAR.
HECTIC.

33:15.094 --> 33:17.163
MULTIPLE MASSAGES EVERY DAY?

33:17.196 --> 33:19.798
- RECEIVING A MASSAGE
IS NOT A CRIME.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.768
- GETTING HAPPY ENDINGS
FROM SCHOOLGIRLS IS.

33:22.801 --> 33:24.603
- I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT.

33:24.636 --> 33:27.039
MY PRESENCE WAS NOT REQUIRED
IN THAT ROOM.

33:27.073 --> 33:29.641
- HALF-NAKED GIRLS
RAN CRYING FROM THAT ROOM.

33:29.675 --> 33:30.709
YOU DID NOTHING ABOUT IT.

33:30.742 --> 33:33.145
- YOU JUST PAID 'EM OFF.
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF 'EM.

33:33.179 --> 33:37.783
- THAT'S CRIMINAL FACILITATION.

33:37.816 --> 33:39.818
- COMPELLING PROSTITUTION,

33:39.851 --> 33:42.688
PROMOTING AN OBSCENE
SEXUAL PERFORMANCE BY A CHILD.

33:42.721 --> 33:43.622
- STOP IT!

33:43.655 --> 33:45.757
- AND IF WE PUT YOU
IN THAT MASSAGE ROOM

33:45.791 --> 33:47.259
WITH JORDY AND DOMINIQUE,

33:47.293 --> 33:49.061
I'M GONNA CHARGE YOU WITH RAPE.

33:49.095 --> 33:50.762
- WHERE DID YOU PUT MY PURSE?
I NEED TO TAKE MY MEDICATION.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.731
- CONSIDER THIS AN INTERVENTION.

33:52.764 --> 33:55.101
- WHY ARE YOU SUCH A BITCH?

33:55.134 --> 33:56.102
- CALLING ME NAMES
ISN'T GONNA GET YOU

33:56.135 --> 33:57.536
OUT OF THE TROUBLE
YOU'RE IN.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.338
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.773
- YOU TROLLED THE CITY LOOKING
FOR VULNERABLE GIRLS

34:01.807 --> 34:03.075
TO SERVICE YOUR BOYFRIEND.

34:03.109 --> 34:04.610
- I TOLD YOU,
HE'S NOT MY BOYFRIEND.

34:04.643 --> 34:05.744
- THAT'S RIGHT.

34:05.777 --> 34:07.813
BECAUSE YOU AGED OUT.

34:07.846 --> 34:11.850
- I'M A LOT YOUNGER THAN YOU,
SKANK.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.386
- WHAT DID HE DO TO DESTROY
YOUR SELF-ESTEEM?

34:14.420 --> 34:15.621
HOW DID HE BREAK YOU?

34:15.654 --> 34:18.390
- HE TREATS ME LIKE A PRINCESS.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.359
I DON'T SEE ANYONE FLYING YOU
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

34:20.392 --> 34:23.395
- DAHLIA,
YOU'RE A TRUST-FUND BABY.

34:23.429 --> 34:27.766
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED HIS MONEY
TO PAY YOUR WAY.

34:27.799 --> 34:31.537
- HE'S THE ONLY PERSON
WHO EVER CARED ABOUT ME.

34:31.570 --> 34:35.741
- EVER?

34:35.774 --> 34:39.745
HOW OLD WERE YOU
WHEN YOU STARTED DATING?

34:39.778 --> 34:44.416
- I MOVED IN WHEN I WAS 17.

34:44.450 --> 34:47.119
- AND HOW OLD WERE YOU
WHEN YOU FIRST HAD SEX?

34:47.153 --> 34:49.355
- WHAT ARE YOU, A COP?

34:49.388 --> 34:51.523
- THAT'S STATUTORY RAPE.

34:51.557 --> 34:54.460
- HE NEVER FORCED ME.
WE WERE IN LOVE.

34:54.493 --> 34:55.827
- DAHLIA, IT'S STILL RAPE.

34:55.861 --> 34:57.829
HE GROOMED YOU.
DON'T YOU SEE THE PATTERN?

34:57.863 --> 35:00.332
- HE LOVES ME!

35:00.366 --> 35:02.534
I'M NOT A WHORE
LIKE ALL OF HIS ONE-OFFS.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.470
I'M THE ONE HE CAN'T LET GO.

35:04.503 --> 35:06.905
- BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT
YOU'LL DO ANYTHING FOR HIM.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.474
THAT'S WHY HE KEEPS YOU AROUND.

35:08.507 --> 35:10.442
- NO, YOU CAN'T COMPREHEND
WHAT WE HAVE.

35:10.476 --> 35:11.777
- OH, HONEY...

35:11.810 --> 35:14.846
I'VE HEARD THAT LINE
A MILLION TIMES.

35:14.880 --> 35:19.285
JORDAN IS NO DIFFERENT
FROM ANY OTHER PREDATOR.

35:19.318 --> 35:21.787
HE'S JUST BETTER-DRESSED.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.192
- HE'S NAKED IN ALL OF THESE.

35:26.225 --> 35:28.294
- I INTERVIEWED THIS GIRL.
HER NAME IS DRU.

35:28.327 --> 35:29.928
- WHERE'D YOU FIND THIS?
- ALMOST DIDN'T.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.897
SEARCHED THE WHOLE PLACE TWICE
BEFORE WE FOUND HIS PANIC ROOM.

35:31.930 --> 35:34.200
IT WAS NOT EASY TO BUST THROUGH.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.534
- YOU GOT A PANIC ROOM?

35:35.567 --> 35:36.835
I THOUGHT YOU WERE INVINCIBLE.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.437
- I WAS WORRIED THE TAPES
WOULD BE PROTECTED.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.771
HUGE DEFENSE CONTRACTOR
LIKE THAT,

35:39.805 --> 35:41.740
I FIGURED HE'D HAVE
NSA-LEVEL ENCRYPTION.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.609
BUT IT ONLY TOOK MY TEAM
A FEW HOURS TO CRACK.

35:43.642 --> 35:44.743
- A FEW HOURS?

35:44.776 --> 35:46.345
IS THIS THE KIND OF CRAP YOU'RE
SELLING THE GOVERNMENT?

35:46.378 --> 35:47.746
NO WONDER
WE HAVEN'T WON THAT WAR YET.

35:47.779 --> 35:48.747
- FUNNY.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.382
MY FRIENDS AT THE PENTAGON

35:50.416 --> 35:51.783
WILL GET A BIG KICK
OUT OF THAT ONE.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.719
- GOTTA LOVE THE ARROGANT ONES.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.454
- WOW.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.456
THAT IS NOT A LOT
TO BE PROUD OF.

35:57.489 --> 35:58.957
- MORALES, TURN IT OFF.
TOO MANY PEOPLE AROUND.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.792
- IS THAT WHY YOU GO
FOR LITTLE GIRLS?

36:00.826 --> 36:01.860
THEY GOT NOTHING
TO COMPARE IT TO?

36:01.893 --> 36:03.629
- SON OF A BITCH,
COME AND SAY THAT TO MY FACE.

36:03.662 --> 36:04.630
- DON'T POKE THE ANIMALS.

36:04.663 --> 36:05.497
- NO, NO.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.399
A LITTLE SENSITIVE THERE,
MONEYBAGS.

36:07.433 --> 36:09.901
FEEL CHEATED
BY MOTHER NATURE?

36:09.935 --> 36:15.173
- YEAH, HOW DID YOU GET INTO
PORN? YOU'RE TINY.

36:16.442 --> 36:17.409
- HEY!

36:17.443 --> 36:18.710
WE NEED A KEY!

36:18.744 --> 36:20.812
[grunting]

36:20.846 --> 36:22.848
- I TOLD YOU...NOT...
TO TOUCH ME.

36:22.881 --> 36:23.682
- GET HIM OFF!

36:23.715 --> 36:24.516
I WAS DEFENDING MYSELF.
YOU SAW HIM.

36:24.550 --> 36:25.717
HE PUT HIS FILTHY HAND
IN MY FACE.

36:25.751 --> 36:28.787
- FIN, TAKE ERNEST TO THE
HOSPITAL, HAVE HIM CHECKED OUT,

36:28.820 --> 36:29.821
AND THEN ESCORT HIM
TO CENTRAL BOOKING.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.290
- JEEZ.

36:31.323 --> 36:32.858
IMAGINE MAKING
SUCH A BIG FUSS

36:32.891 --> 36:34.526
OVER A LITTLE THING LIKE THAT.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.595
- [growling]

36:36.628 --> 36:37.596
- HEY, GIMME A REASON--

36:37.629 --> 36:40.732
GIMME A REASON TO SLAM YOUR FACE
INTO THE BARS.

36:48.574 --> 36:51.243
[door latches]

36:51.277 --> 36:52.378
[handcuffs clicking]

36:52.411 --> 36:54.480
- I HAVE A SPLITTING HEADACHE.
I REALLY NEED A XANAX.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.482
- TELL 'EM AT CENTRAL BOOKING.

36:56.515 --> 36:57.583
- WHAT?

36:57.616 --> 36:59.818
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING
TO SEE A JUDGE FOR MY BAIL.

36:59.851 --> 37:01.520
- OH, THAT'S AFTER
YOU'RE PROCESSED.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.889
FIRST IT'S FINGERPRINTS,
MUG SHOT...

37:03.922 --> 37:05.557
CAVITY SEARCH.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.759
- DOES JORDY KNOW
YOU'RE DOING THIS TO ME?

37:07.793 --> 37:09.595
- OH, JORDY LAWYERED UP.
WE CAN'T TALK TO HIM.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.363
- WHAT ABOUT ME?
DON'T I GET A LAWYER?

37:11.397 --> 37:12.898
- I READ YOU YOUR RIGHTS
THREE TIMES.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.633
YOU DIDN'T ASK FOR A LAWYER.

37:14.666 --> 37:15.901
- BUT JORDY DID IT FOR ME.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.003
HE TOLD ME TO LET HIS LAWYERS
TAKE CARE OF THIS.

37:18.036 --> 37:20.472
- YOU FELL FOR THAT?

37:20.506 --> 37:22.874
JORDY'S CUTTING A DEAL
RIGHT NOW.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.676
- WHAT?

37:24.710 --> 37:27.713
- HE'S ONLY LOOKING OUT
FOR HIMSELF.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.949
- HELLO?

37:30.982 --> 37:32.784
I NEED SOME ASSISTANCE HERE.

37:41.527 --> 37:42.861
- WHAT DO YOU WANT NOW?

37:42.894 --> 37:45.764
- I NEED TO USE THE FACILITIES.

37:45.797 --> 37:48.334
UNLESS YOU PREFER
I PISS ON THE FLOOR.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.305
- SHOULD I GET MY OWN LAWYER?

37:53.339 --> 37:54.906
- THAT'S UP TO YOU.
DO YOU KNOW ONE?

37:54.940 --> 37:56.642
- I HAVE A BUSINESS ATTORNEY.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.310
- WELL, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
HIRE ONE THAT SPECIALIZES

37:58.344 --> 37:59.745
IN CRIMINAL DEFENSE.

37:59.778 --> 38:00.812
- HEY.

38:00.846 --> 38:01.880
YOU LIED TO ME.

38:01.913 --> 38:02.848
HE'S STILL HERE.
JORDY!

38:02.881 --> 38:05.817
- LAST CHANCE TO TALK
TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

38:05.851 --> 38:07.953
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS.

38:07.986 --> 38:09.588
YOU SAID I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY.

38:09.621 --> 38:10.889
- YOU DON'T.
I'M HANDLING THIS.

38:10.922 --> 38:12.491
- OKAY.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.460
CAPTAIN, WHAT'S GOING ON?
THIS IS OUR CASE.

38:14.493 --> 38:16.962
- NOT ANYMORE.
FEDS MADE A DEAL.

38:16.995 --> 38:17.963
- WE CRACKED IT.
WE DID ALL THE WORK--

38:17.996 --> 38:18.964
- IT'S DONE.

38:18.997 --> 38:21.767
THERE'S NOTHING MORE I CAN DO.
HAND HIM OVER.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.469
- WE HAVE THE RESOURCES
TO HANDLE THE VOLUME

38:23.502 --> 38:24.503
OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY INVOLVED.

38:24.536 --> 38:26.338
- YEAH, RIGHT.

38:26.372 --> 38:30.742
SO WHO'D YOU PAY OFF?

38:30.776 --> 38:32.544
- WE'LL NEED THOSE HARD DRIVES.

38:32.578 --> 38:33.779
- WHY IS THERE BLOOD
ON MY CLIENT?

38:33.812 --> 38:38.884
- IT'S NOTHING. LET'S GO.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.919
- WHAT ABOUT ME? YOU'RE TAKING
ME WITH YOU, RIGHT?

38:40.952 --> 38:41.987
- NOT RIGHT NOW.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.822
BUT A MEMBER OF MY FIRM

38:43.855 --> 38:45.891
WILL REPRESENT YOU
AT ARRAIGNMENT TOMORROW.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.926
- WILL JORDY BE THERE?
- NO.

38:47.959 --> 38:49.595
NOT WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.730
HE'S GOING OFF TO
A FEDERAL COUNTRY CLUB.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.832
- WHILE YOU'RE FACING
UP TO 80 YEARS.

38:53.865 --> 38:56.902
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
HE'D NEVER DO THAT TO ME.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.605
TELL THEM THAT'S NOT TRUE,
JORDAN.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.907
- YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE,
DAHLIA.

39:01.940 --> 39:04.943
YOU'RE A SURVIVOR.
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

39:04.976 --> 39:06.512
- YOU SCREWED ME OVER?

39:06.545 --> 39:08.714
- YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.

39:08.747 --> 39:10.782
- I'VE TRUSTED YOU FOR YEARS.
WHAT'S THAT GOT ME?

39:10.816 --> 39:12.584
- CALM DOWN.

39:12.618 --> 39:14.119
- I'M ON THOSE TAPES!

39:14.152 --> 39:16.688
DOING EVERYTHING
YOU TOLD ME TO DO.

39:16.722 --> 39:17.556
- DAHLIA, SHUT UP.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.891
- EVERY PERVERTED,
DISGUSTING THING.

39:19.925 --> 39:21.026
- NOW IS NOT THE TIME.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.061
- THEY SAID I COULD GO TO JAIL
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

39:23.094 --> 39:27.098
AND THAT EVEN IF I GET OUT, I'LL
BE A REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.009
[whimpers]

39:47.118 --> 39:50.756
- CAN WE GO NOW?

39:50.789 --> 39:52.591
- NO.

39:52.624 --> 39:55.661
NO, DON'T LEAVE ME, PLEASE!

39:55.694 --> 39:58.163
JORDAN!

39:58.196 --> 40:00.899
PLEASE COME BACK, PLEASE!

40:00.932 --> 40:04.135
PLEASE COME BACK!
PLEASE!

40:04.169 --> 40:07.639
I LOVE YOU!

40:07.673 --> 40:12.778
[sobbing]
