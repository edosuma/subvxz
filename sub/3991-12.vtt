WEBVTT

00:03.200 --> 00:06.260
- You think this was a copycat?
- I almost feel like he's
mocking her.

00:06.300 --> 00:08.734
Your name is Georgia Madchen.

00:08.770 --> 00:11.261
You're not alone.
Somebody told him

00:11.310 --> 00:14.473
we were coming.
- The man on the phone?
- Did you recognize his voice?

00:14.510 --> 00:16.705
- How much would I get
if you wrote a book about me?

00:16.750 --> 00:19.173
- Nicholas Boyle was gutted
with a hunting knife.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.176
You knew how to do that.
- You think I did this?

00:21.220 --> 00:23.438
- You and I are just gonna have
to have a difference of opinion

00:23.490 --> 00:25.617
about who Will is, Doctor.
- I'm worried about you, Will.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.289
What if you lose time and hurt
yourself? Or someone else?

00:28.320 --> 00:30.459
(gunshot)

00:42.240 --> 00:44.208
(ventilator pumping)

00:44.240 --> 00:46.231
(monitor beeping)

00:59.220 --> 01:01.085
(device beep)

01:03.360 --> 01:05.328
- You look better.

01:05.360 --> 01:09.797
- Do I look alive?

01:09.830 --> 01:13.163
- You look pretty.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.308
- Must be all the oxygen.

01:21.580 --> 01:23.571
They say what's wrong with you?

01:23.610 --> 01:26.670
- No, just the fever.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.143
They're trying to find out
what else.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.715
- They won't find anything.

01:31.750 --> 01:35.413
They'll keep looking,
keep taking tests,

01:35.460 --> 01:39.294
keep giving false diagnoses,
bad meds.

01:39.330 --> 01:42.197
But they won't find out
what's wrong.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.168
They'll just know

01:46.200 --> 01:48.566
that you're wrong.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.704
I hope you have good insurance.

01:50.740 --> 01:53.834
- I do too.

01:53.880 --> 01:57.202
- They're going to give me
shock treatment.

01:57.250 --> 02:01.311
Electroconvulsive therapy is
what it's called.

02:01.350 --> 02:04.786
Shock treatment sounds nicer.

02:04.820 --> 02:08.256
- People who have
what you have can
recover with shock treatment.

02:08.290 --> 02:11.259
- You know how many times
I've been told

02:11.290 --> 02:15.192
I could recover with treatment?

02:15.230 --> 02:18.358
They said I might remember
what I did.

02:20.900 --> 02:23.539
But I don't want to remember.

02:26.580 --> 02:29.299
- You know what you did,
Georgia.

02:31.310 --> 02:33.574
- But I don't remember it.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.288
It feels more like

02:38.320 --> 02:41.380
a horrible dream
where I killed my friend.

02:44.860 --> 02:47.749
- You dream about killing
anybody else?

02:47.800 --> 02:51.327
- I dream you killed
that doctor.

02:57.740 --> 03:01.278
But I couldn't see your face.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.780
- Smells delicious.

03:15.820 --> 03:19.449
- Silkie chicken in a broth.
A black-boned

03:19.500 --> 03:21.297
bird prized in China

03:21.330 --> 03:24.299
for its medicinal values
since the 7th century.

03:24.330 --> 03:27.936
Wolfberries, ginseng,
ginger, red dates,

03:27.970 --> 03:30.438
and star anise.

03:30.470 --> 03:33.701
- You made me chicken soup?

03:35.710 --> 03:37.439
- Yes.

03:42.850 --> 03:45.444
The nurses tell _me _
you've been wandering, WIll.

03:47.460 --> 03:50.952
- I was awake... heh...

03:50.990 --> 03:54.289
and wandering with... purpose

03:54.330 --> 03:56.469
and good intentions.

03:58.470 --> 04:00.836
- Visiting that unfortunate
young woman

04:00.870 --> 04:03.259
suffering from delusions.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.266
- She's my support group.

04:05.310 --> 04:07.528
- And I hope you're hers.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.969
Nothing more isolating
than mental illness.

04:22.430 --> 04:23.920
- The hallucinations,

04:23.960 --> 04:29.318
the, um, loss of time,
sleepwalking...

04:29.370 --> 04:32.760
could that have all just been
the fever?

04:32.800 --> 04:37.339
- Fevers can be symptoms
of dementia.

04:37.370 --> 04:40.430
Dementia can be a symptom
of many things happening

04:40.480 --> 04:43.472
in your body or mind that can
no longer be ignored, Will.

04:48.550 --> 04:50.347
- Does Jack know?

04:50.390 --> 04:53.689
- That this could be more than
a fever? No. I haven't told him.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.688
- Shouldn't you?

04:55.720 --> 04:57.722
- Not until we know
for certain.

05:00.860 --> 05:05.763
What we must do now is _continue
to support and monitor
your recovery.

05:05.800 --> 05:09.566
This young woman
you were visiting,

05:09.610 --> 05:12.101
how's her recovery?

05:12.140 --> 05:15.906
- I don't think she wants
to recover.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.704
Afraid to remember
what she did.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.711
- Can't say I blame her.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.829
(owgen flowing)

05:30.860 --> 05:32.851
(monitor beeping)

05:37.100 --> 05:39.466
(metallic thud)

06:08.860 --> 06:10.862
(zap)

06:21.480 --> 06:23.505
(no sound)

06:39.660 --> 06:42.959
***

07:24.010 --> 07:26.672
- The hospital speculates
that it was a short circuit

07:26.710 --> 07:29.770
that ignited the fire.
- Unit looks well maintained.

07:29.810 --> 07:31.801
No exposed wiring.

07:33.820 --> 07:35.776
- Horrible way to die.

07:35.820 --> 07:38.789
- There was a kid in Italy
who was in one of these things.

07:38.820 --> 07:41.983
A spark of static electricity
from his pajamas set it off.

07:42.020 --> 07:46.229
Two cubic yards of owgen
suddenly became two cubic
yards of fire.

07:46.260 --> 07:48.228
- Is it possible
that she set the fire herself?

07:48.260 --> 07:50.228
- She wasn't wearing
her grounding bracelet,

07:50.270 --> 07:52.966
which prevents the build-up
of static electricity.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.800
She took it off.
- Suicide by immolation?

07:56.840 --> 07:58.808
- She was facing
two murder charges.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.070
- She wasn't
suicidal, Jack.

08:01.110 --> 08:03.544
Sh-She was sick.

08:03.580 --> 08:06.003
I was here.
I spoke to her.

08:08.580 --> 08:11.686
- Why did you speak
with her?

08:11.720 --> 08:15.087
- Because I know
how she felt.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.089
- She's a murder suspect.
She tried to kill you.

08:18.130 --> 08:20.690
Your trying to be her friend
impacts the case against her.

08:20.730 --> 08:23.096
- Well, the case against her
doesn't really matter anymore,

08:23.130 --> 08:24.722
does it, Jack?

08:33.340 --> 08:36.309
- We could use the articles
I wrote at the time

08:36.340 --> 08:39.969
of each of the murders
as book chapter headings.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.239
The chapters themselves will be
you telling your story--

08:43.290 --> 08:46.316
where you were and what you were
thinking when, one by one,

08:46.350 --> 08:50.184
eight girls just like you
all over Minnesota were

08:50.230 --> 08:53.757
disappearing.
- What are we gonna call it?

08:53.800 --> 08:58.169
- I thought about
The Last Victim,

08:58.200 --> 09:02.239
but there is already a book
about serial killers called
The Last Victim.

09:02.270 --> 09:04.704
- Was it a bestseller?

09:04.740 --> 09:06.207
- Absolutely.

09:06.240 --> 09:09.004
Especially after the guy
who wrote it killed himself.

09:12.150 --> 09:13.845
- Just as well.

09:13.880 --> 09:17.043
Wasn't really my dad's
last victim anyway, was I?

09:21.720 --> 09:23.187
- Who was?

09:23.230 --> 09:25.949
- Marissa.

09:25.990 --> 09:30.120
- Marissa Schuur was killed
by the copycat.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.899
So was Cassie Boyle.

09:31.930 --> 09:34.239
- I still blame my dad.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.629
- Blame him
for Nick Boyle's death?

09:38.670 --> 09:43.039
- I blame Nick Boyle
for Nick Boyle's death.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.742
He killed Marissa.
He got what was coming to him.

09:45.780 --> 09:47.645
- Nick Boyle did not
kill your friend.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.113
- Then who did?

09:51.820 --> 09:54.812
- Better question is:
who killed Nick?

09:58.260 --> 10:01.252
Nick Boyle was
just a dumb kid

10:01.300 --> 10:06.260
who was really messed up
because his sister was murdered.

10:06.300 --> 10:09.030
He wasn't a killer.

10:09.070 --> 10:12.779
I've interviewed enough killers
to know one when I see one.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.842
- What gives them away?

10:20.950 --> 10:24.078
- A very specific brand
of hostility.

10:26.090 --> 10:29.355
I see it every time I look
at Will Graham.

10:29.390 --> 10:32.359
- He did kill my dad.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.897
- As far as I'm concerned,
he killed Nick Boyle.

10:36.930 --> 10:42.664
He and Jack Crawford told
everyone NIck was the copycat,

10:42.710 --> 10:45.361
and then someone murdered him
for It.

10:45.410 --> 10:48.937
- You really don't think
he did it.

10:51.310 --> 10:55.314
- Whoever killed Nicholas Boyle
killed an innocent man.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.941
- See?

12:03.990 --> 12:06.288
See?

12:31.410 --> 12:34.516
- What are you doing here?
- Checked myself out
of the hospital.

12:34.550 --> 12:36.984
- Well, check yourself back in.
- My fever broke.

12:37.020 --> 12:39.238
- I don't care.
- Georgia Madchen didn't

12:39.290 --> 12:42.851
commit suicide, and whatever
happened to her wasn't
an accident.

12:42.890 --> 12:45.427
- I'm gonna have Z come down
here and stick a thermometer

12:45.460 --> 12:49.055
in you, and if you've got
a temperature higher than 99--
- She was murdered, Jack.

12:52.170 --> 12:53.535
- By who?

12:53.570 --> 12:57.529
- By whoever killed
Dr. Sutcliffe.

12:57.570 --> 13:02.030
- His blood was all over
Georgia Madchen. Her DNA was

13:02.080 --> 13:04.048
all over him.
- She told me there was

13:04.080 --> 13:07.948
somebody else there.
She couldn't see his face.

13:07.980 --> 13:10.540
- There was somebody else there.
It was Dr. Sutcliffe.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.150
She couldn't see his face
because she cut it

13:13.190 --> 13:15.010
in half! Will,

13:15.060 --> 13:17.085
I understand. You're looking
for an explanation,

13:17.130 --> 13:19.155
an explanation
that makes all of this OK.

13:19.190 --> 13:21.897
- No! No, no, no. I don't.
That is not what I want. Listen,

13:21.930 --> 13:24.194
something went wrong, and
we will never know what that is,

13:24.230 --> 13:28.462
but for all the doctors she saw,
for all of the help
she received,

13:28.500 --> 13:30.559
she was ﬁghting
that wrong alone.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.566
- There is nothing you could do
about that.

13:32.610 --> 13:35.374
- All her adult life
this woman was misunderstood,

13:35.410 --> 13:36.968
And what I can do

13:37.010 --> 13:41.344
is make sure that her death
isn't misunderstood.

13:41.380 --> 13:44.588
She didn't kill herself.

13:44.620 --> 13:47.509
And this wasn't an accident.

13:52.490 --> 13:54.924
(heartbeat)

13:54.960 --> 13:57.963
(speaking indistinctly)

14:06.110 --> 14:09.534
- So, we dismantled
the oxygen chamber--see if
anyone tampered with the wiring,

14:09.580 --> 14:11.639
or even like a short circuit.
But nothing.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.216
- So what sparked the fire?

14:13.250 --> 14:14.615
- Inconclusive, but--

14:14.650 --> 14:18.484
- Not conclusively inconclusive.
Found this.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.954
Thought it might've been part of
the bed or monitoring equipment,

14:20.990 --> 14:23.959
but mass spectrometer said
it was celluloid plastic.

14:23.990 --> 14:25.958
They don't use plastic
in those things.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.629
- Right, right. It generates,
uh, static electricity.

14:28.660 --> 14:32.266
- Her_ hair_ was
melted right In there,
preserved like it was in amber.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.504
- Could it_ have been
a plastic comb?

14:38.540 --> 14:42.636
- Well, static charge from
a plastic comb in a highly
oxygenated environment

14:42.680 --> 14:46.104
would be a powerful accelerant.
- (Brian): Anything combustible
in there would combust.

14:46.150 --> 14:48.118
- You're holding
the murder weapon.

14:48.150 --> 14:50.687
- Or whatever she used
to kill herself, yeah?

14:50.720 --> 14:53.314
- Will--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.089
- Whoever killed Sutcliffe

14:55.120 --> 14:57.259
wanted to kill him
how Georgia Madchen

14:57.290 --> 15:01.090
killed her victim, but...
but not exactly how. Correct?

15:01.130 --> 15:04.293
- Georgia Madchen carved up
her victim's face.

15:04.330 --> 15:06.662
Sutcliffe was, uh, nearly
decapitated at the jaw.
I mean...

15:06.700 --> 15:08.668
- So she went further
the second time.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.703
Serial killers often do that.
- She was copied. Like, uh,

15:11.740 --> 15:15.278
whoever killed Marissa Schuur
and Cassie Boyle wanted to copy

15:15.310 --> 15:18.302
how Garret Jacob Hobbs killed
his victims.

15:25.590 --> 15:28.457
But not exactly how.

15:28.490 --> 15:30.651
- Wait a minute.
Are you sayIng

15:30.690 --> 15:35.298
that Dr. Sutcliffe was killed
by Garret Jacob Hobbs' copycat?

15:38.530 --> 15:41.067
- So was Georgia Madchen.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.701
Because he thinks
she saw his face.

15:45.740 --> 15:48.004
- You said Nicholas Boyle was
the copycat.

15:48.040 --> 15:51.407
His blood was
on one of the victims.
Nicholas Boyle is dead.

15:51.450 --> 15:54.749
- Well, then he isn't
the copycat.

15:54.780 --> 15:58.181
- Could_ this be more
than just a fever?

15:58.220 --> 16:01.678
Will is connecting murders that
previously had no connections.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.278
- Beyond his involvement

16:03.330 --> 16:06.049
in the investigations?
- That's right.

16:06.090 --> 16:09.423
- So you're wondering
if the lines are blurring,
or if he's on to something.

16:09.460 --> 16:11.462
- I'm wondering
all sorts of things.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.609
What's Will's relationship
with Abigail Hobbs right now?

16:23.350 --> 16:25.705
- You think he's protecting her.
- He has been

16:25.750 --> 16:29.345
ever since he shot her father.
I just don't know from what.

16:29.380 --> 16:32.247
- I can't imagine he would hide
anything criminal from you.

16:32.290 --> 16:36.056
I've only ever known Will
as a man striving to be
his best self.

16:36.090 --> 16:39.480
- You haven't known him
that long.

16:39.530 --> 16:42.192
But we both know him well enough
to know he hasn't been himself.

16:42.230 --> 16:45.461
- He needs our support,

16:45.500 --> 16:48.697
whether or _not
mental Illness IS Involved.

16:48.740 --> 16:52.437
- Mental illness...

16:52.470 --> 16:54.574
Is it really mental illness,
Doctor, or is it just that

16:54.610 --> 16:57.044
his mind works so differently
from most people's

16:57.080 --> 16:59.548
that we don't know
what else to call it?

17:01.750 --> 17:05.208
- There are days
when even Will doesn't
understand his own thinking.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.522
(knocking on door)

17:12.790 --> 17:14.348
- Dr. DuMaurier.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.595
I'm Special Agent Jack Crawford
with the FBI.

17:16.630 --> 17:19.360
I'd like to talk with you
about a patient of yours.

17:25.570 --> 17:28.334
(music playing)
- Do you have a court order?

17:28.380 --> 17:30.348
- Well, I'd rather not get one

17:30.380 --> 17:32.746
if I don't have to.
(mu5Ic turned off)

17:32.780 --> 17:35.340
- So _it's_ not_
an offICIal IanIry.

17:35.380 --> 17:36.847
- Not yet.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.144
I'd hate to damage
anyone's reputation

17:39.190 --> 17:41.158
unnecessarily.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.750
- Whose reputation would
that be?

17:43.790 --> 17:46.327
- I suspect that Dr. Hannibal

17:46.360 --> 17:48.499
Lecter may be withholding
pertinent information

17:48.530 --> 17:52.296
involving a murder
investigation.

17:52.330 --> 17:55.367
No, thank you.

17:55.400 --> 17:59.530
- So... he hasn't confided
in the FBI.

17:59.570 --> 18:03.609
You are hoping he's confided
in his psychiatrist

18:03.650 --> 18:05.675
and that I'll tell you.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.439
- Yes, ma'am.

18:09.450 --> 18:11.680
It's not that I think
Dr. Lecter's dangerous. I don't.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.689
I am concerned
about a relationship he has

18:14.720 --> 18:16.813
with one of his patients,
a man named Will Graham.

18:16.860 --> 18:20.159
- Without consent
or a court order,

18:20.200 --> 18:22.725
I'd be in breach
of confidentiality.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.558
- That's correct.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.898
So, if we can't discuss
Dr. Lecter,

18:27.940 --> 18:30.602
perhaps we can discuss you.

18:30.640 --> 18:34.906
You were attacked by a patient
not too long ago.

18:34.940 --> 18:36.908
I read the report.

18:36.940 --> 18:40.444
I know that there was
a statement gIven by Dr. Lecter.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.608
- The patient who attacked me

18:43.650 --> 18:46.915
was a former patient
of Dr. Lecter.

18:46.950 --> 18:49.657
- And he was referred to you
by Dr. Lecter?

18:49.690 --> 18:52.682
- Yes.
- And this patient
almost killed you.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.863
- He swallowed his tongue
while he was attacking me.

18:57.900 --> 19:00.539
That's the only thing
that saved my life.

19:00.570 --> 19:04.301
- Well, thank God
for small favors.

19:04.340 --> 19:06.501
- Yes, thank God.

19:09.380 --> 19:11.473
- You should know there was
another attack recently

19:11.510 --> 19:14.741
in Dr. Lecter's office.
It involved another patient.

19:14.780 --> 19:17.817
Two dead, including the patient.

19:17.850 --> 19:22.549
- That's not bad psychology,
Agent Crawford.

19:22.590 --> 19:25.229
Putting me in a position
to have to defend

19:25.260 --> 19:27.797
or not to defend Dr. Lecter.
- You have to admit

19:27.830 --> 19:30.822
he's had some pretty strange
relationships with some
of his patients.

19:32.830 --> 19:36.766
- Complicated patients are
conducive to complicated
relationships.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.700
- All right.

19:38.740 --> 19:41.777
How far do you think

19:41.810 --> 19:45.701
Dr. Lecter would go
in his therapy to treat
a patient? Specifically,

19:45.750 --> 19:47.513
Will Graham.

19:47.550 --> 19:51.611
- Hannibal refers
to Will Graham

19:51.650 --> 19:55.313
more as a friend
than as a patIent.

19:55.360 --> 19:59.456
- How far do you think
he would go to treat a friend?

19:59.490 --> 20:01.856
- Well, he doesn't have
many of them,

20:01.900 --> 20:05.461
so I imagine
he'd be loyal.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.867
I know that he's concerned
about Will Graham

20:08.900 --> 20:12.768
and I know that he wants
to help him.

20:12.810 --> 20:15.836
- Well, I consider Will
a friend,

20:15.880 --> 20:18.348
and I'd like
to help him too.

20:18.380 --> 20:21.611
- It seems to me
that Will Graham would do well

20:21.650 --> 20:23.743
to have more friends like

20:23.790 --> 20:25.985
Dr. Lecter.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.991
- Will Graham theorized
that the copycat killer

20:36.030 --> 20:39.761
and Garret Jacob Hobbs were
somehow connected--

20:39.800 --> 20:41.768
that he had insight

20:41.800 --> 20:44.360
into Hobbs' personal life,
that they may have met,

20:44.410 --> 20:46.765
known each other,
perhaps even killed together.

20:46.810 --> 20:49.779
- See, I would call that less of
a theory, more of a hypothesis.

20:49.810 --> 20:52.370
- Hm, theories require evidence.
- Hm.

20:52.410 --> 20:55.777
- Let's play Jeopardy, shall we?
The answer is that

20:55.820 --> 20:58.345
these people were killed
by the copycat, who's connected

20:58.390 --> 21:00.381
to Garret Jacob Hobbs.
You tell me how.

21:00.420 --> 21:02.388
- You mean beyond
the application

21:02.420 --> 21:04.388
of supposition
and unexplained leaps?

21:04.430 --> 21:06.955
- Yes, that's right.
- I've been yearning

21:06.990 --> 21:09.322
for a return to the fundamentals
of Investigation.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.793
- Right?

21:10.830 --> 21:12.798
- Where is Beverly?

21:12.830 --> 21:15.936
- Jury duty.
- It's... She's
deposed in court.

21:15.970 --> 21:19.428
- Get her out of court.
Then here's what we're gonna do.

21:19.470 --> 21:23.941
I wanna look at train station,
airport, toll road,
hotel details.

21:23.980 --> 21:28.019
I wanna track Garret Jacob Hobbs
usmg lIcense plate capture
from security footage.

21:28.050 --> 21:32.680
I also want to know
every phone call he made
and where he made them from.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.917
- I'll see ifI can get R&I to
loan us a couple of clerks
to help us cross-match.

21:35.960 --> 21:39.384
- Good. I also want to know
every place that he went
that wasn't home.

21:39.430 --> 21:41.694
I want to know how long he was
there, I want to know who he was

21:41.730 --> 21:45.063
there with, and I want
to know the travel time
to the nearest mIssmg gIrl

21:45.100 --> 21:47.068
in the Minnesota Shrike case.
You got It?

21:47.100 --> 21:49.432
- Yep.
- OK.

21:51.570 --> 21:53.709
- You told me
that killing someone was

21:53.740 --> 21:55.731
the ugliest thing in the world.

21:58.750 --> 22:02.117
- One of them.

22:02.150 --> 22:04.345
- I finally get it.

22:06.750 --> 22:08.980
I thought there was
something wrong with me

22:09.020 --> 22:12.751
because I didn't feel ugly
when I killed Nick Boyle.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.724
I felt good.

22:17.130 --> 22:19.792
That's why it was so easy
to lie about it.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.007
- Like you didn't do
anything wrong.

22:24.040 --> 22:27.601
- Feel like you'd done something
wrong when you killed my dad?

22:27.640 --> 22:31.474
- I felt terrified.

22:33.750 --> 22:35.968
And then...

22:36.020 --> 22:38.011
I felt powerful.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.458
- It felt good...

22:43.490 --> 22:47.028
to get to end it,
to stop it all.

22:47.060 --> 22:51.019
I thought I got away from him.
- Oh,

22:51.070 --> 22:54.392
I don't think either of us have
gotten away from your father.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.100
- I wish I'd killed him.

23:00.110 --> 23:01.998
For killing my mom,

23:02.040 --> 23:05.077
for killing all those girls,
for making me...

23:05.110 --> 23:07.874
- Making you what, Abigail?

23:07.920 --> 23:10.741
- Part of it.

23:10.790 --> 23:14.510
Part of any of it.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.949
This wasn't supposed
to be my life.

23:21.060 --> 23:23.961
It feels like my dad's
still out there.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.969
- In a way, he is.

23:28.970 --> 23:31.404
- You mean the copycat.

23:33.210 --> 23:35.474
- I think I can catch him.

23:43.690 --> 23:46.409
But I'm gonna need your help.

24:02.240 --> 24:05.164
- An agent from the FBI came
to see me.

24:07.170 --> 24:11.743
He asked me questions about your
relationship with Will Graham.

24:11.780 --> 24:15.614
- Jack Crawford was here?

24:15.650 --> 24:17.811
- Mm.

24:17.850 --> 24:19.818
He had enough doubt

24:19.850 --> 24:23.013
in whatever it is you told him
about your patient

24:23.060 --> 24:25.483
to feel the need to verify.

24:25.530 --> 24:29.091
- He believes Abigail Hobbs was
involved in her father's crimes,

24:29.130 --> 24:31.564
and he suspects Will is
protecting her.

24:31.600 --> 24:35.263
- And evidently he suspects
you are protecting Will.

24:35.300 --> 24:38.701
Are you?

24:38.740 --> 24:42.073
- Are you asking
as my psychiatrist?

24:44.080 --> 24:47.174
- I'm stepping out of my role
as your psychiatrist

24:47.210 --> 24:50.145
and I'm speaking to you now
as your colleague.

24:52.150 --> 24:54.710
Whatever you're doing
with Will Graham,

24:54.760 --> 24:57.183
stop.

24:57.220 --> 24:59.984
- Will needs my help.

25:00.030 --> 25:03.591
- You'v_e crossed
profeSSIonal lInes.

25:03.630 --> 25:05.723
- By making a friend?

25:05.770 --> 25:08.989
- You cannot function
as an agent of frIendshIp

25:09.040 --> 25:12.134
for a man who is disconnected
from the concept

25:12.170 --> 25:15.674
as a man who is disconnected
from the concept.

25:15.710 --> 25:18.873
- I'm protecting Will
from influence.

25:18.910 --> 25:22.619
He has flaws
in his intuitive beliefs
about what makes him who he is.

25:22.650 --> 25:24.743
I'm trying to help him
understand.

25:24.790 --> 25:27.008
- You may not be able to.

25:27.050 --> 25:30.156
- I'm not comfortable
telling Will

25:30.190 --> 25:32.579
that my very best attempts
to help him may fail

25:32.630 --> 25:35.849
and that my loyalty to him
and his treatment could
be compromised.

25:35.900 --> 25:39.165
- Then tell him
something else.

25:39.200 --> 25:43.933
Agent Crawford also asked me
about my attack.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.179
- I see.

25:51.310 --> 25:53.301
What did you tell him?

25:55.780 --> 25:57.179
- Half-truths.

25:59.790 --> 26:04.727
That a violent patient swallowed
his tongue while he was
attacking me.

26:06.730 --> 26:10.325
I didn't tell him
how or why

26:10.360 --> 26:13.090
or who was responsible.

26:15.940 --> 26:20.206
- You protect your patient
from Jack Crawford, but
I can't protect mine.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.878
- Not anymore.

26:21.910 --> 26:24.845
Even the very best psychiatrists

26:24.880 --> 26:29.044
have _an inherent limitation
to theIr profeSSIonal abIIItIes.

26:29.080 --> 26:32.686
You may find that difficult
to accept.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.950
- You're right. It is.

26:34.990 --> 26:38.323
- You have to maintain
boundaries, Hannibal.

26:40.430 --> 26:42.398
- When the pressures
of my personal

26:42.430 --> 26:46.127
and professional relationships
with Will grow too great,

26:46.170 --> 26:48.866
I assure you...

26:48.900 --> 26:51.164
I'll find a way
to relieve them.

27:01.250 --> 27:04.686
- I'm much better now.

27:04.720 --> 27:08.178
I feel clearer.

27:08.220 --> 27:11.223
It had to be the fever.

27:11.260 --> 27:15.219
I am finally thinking clearly
about the copycat.

27:17.730 --> 27:20.665
- The murders you're attributing
to the copycat have suspects

27:20.700 --> 27:24.067
whose DNA was found
on the victims.
- So what?

27:24.110 --> 27:27.364
- You're choosing
to ignore that?

27:27.410 --> 27:30.129
- Both of those suspects are
dead. I'm choosing

27:30.180 --> 27:33.377
to factor that into my
psychological profile
of a killer.

27:33.410 --> 27:35.378
Georgia Madchen followed me
to Sutcliffe's office,

27:35.420 --> 27:37.274
she witnessed his murder,
she saw the copycat.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.288
- Why not kill her
then and there?

27:39.320 --> 27:42.153
- Well, maybe h-he didn't have
the time. You know, she was

27:42.190 --> 27:44.886
an unreliable witness,
so that bought him time.

27:44.930 --> 27:48.195
- So he framed her
for the murder.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.389
- But he wasn't planning
on framing her.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.436
He was planning on framing me.

27:58.470 --> 28:00.267
- You believe this is personal?

28:03.410 --> 28:05.378
- If it wasn't before,

28:05.410 --> 28:07.378
it is now.

28:07.410 --> 28:09.469
This could be someone
at the bureau,

28:09.520 --> 28:11.988
someone in the police
department, someone who knows

28:12.020 --> 28:15.148
the crimes and _has_access
to the InvestIgatIons.

28:15.190 --> 28:17.317
- Someone like you.

28:19.330 --> 28:21.457
- There will be evidence.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.992
I found a pattern and now I'm
gonna reconstruct his thinking.

28:25.030 --> 28:27.863
- How do you intend
to do that?

28:27.900 --> 28:29.868
- By taking Abigail
back to Minnesota.

28:29.900 --> 28:32.403
Start where the copycat started

28:32.440 --> 28:34.408
when he called
Garret Jacob Hobbs.

28:34.440 --> 28:37.273
- Will, this is venturing
into the paranoid.

28:37.310 --> 28:40.302
I can't allow you to pull
Abigail into your delusion.

28:40.350 --> 28:42.318
- This isn't a delusion.

28:42.350 --> 28:44.944
I'm not hallucinating.
I haven't lost time.

28:44.990 --> 28:48.050
I am awake and this is real.

28:59.100 --> 29:01.762
- (Brian): We found
train tickets

29:01.800 --> 29:04.030
purchased by Garret Jacob Hobbs.
- Tickets?

29:04.070 --> 29:07.801
- Two.
- For the_ same train line that
one of ms VIctIms was usmg.

29:07.840 --> 29:11.378
- Elise Nichols?
- Found more instances
of Hobbs crossing with victims.

29:11.410 --> 29:13.549
Dinner receipts for two,
and two hotel rooms

29:13.580 --> 29:15.969
near the same campuses.
- We know

29:16.020 --> 29:18.215
he wasn't traveling alone.
- He was traveling

29:18.250 --> 29:21.219
with his daughter?
- They were both registered
for the same orientation program

29:21.260 --> 29:24.149
at St. Cloud State
on the Mississippi, which is
where the Nichols girl was going

29:24.190 --> 29:27.387
to school.
- Abigail Hobbs attended
orientations at every school

29:27.430 --> 29:31.059
where a girl was abducted by
the Minnesota Shrike within
days of the abduction.

29:31.100 --> 29:33.933
- She was with him when he was
choosing these girls.

29:33.970 --> 29:35.835
- She was the bait.

29:35.870 --> 29:39.499
She was helping him
choose the girls.

29:39.540 --> 29:43.408
- The connection between
the copycat killer and Garret
Jacob Hobbs might be family.

29:43.440 --> 29:46.000
- She kills Cassie Boyle
to impress Dad?

29:46.050 --> 29:48.109
She kills Marissa Schuur
In memorIam,

29:48.150 --> 29:50.516
then she kills Nicholas Boyle
to cover her tracks?

29:50.550 --> 29:52.984
- Then why kill Dr. Sutcliffe?
Or the Madchen girl?

29:53.020 --> 29:55.159
- Because she's got a taste
for it now.

29:57.420 --> 30:00.480
Or she wants to impress
someone new.

30:05.430 --> 30:07.398
- Hello, Agent Crawford.

30:07.430 --> 30:09.534
- Freddie Lounds.

30:09.570 --> 30:11.936
- You look like you came here
to arrest somebody.

30:11.970 --> 30:13.938
Is it Abigail Hobbs,
or Will Graham?

30:13.980 --> 30:15.402
- Will Graham was here?

30:15.440 --> 30:18.273
- Oh, then it was Abigail Hobbs.
- Where is she?

30:18.310 --> 30:21.609
- One of the other girls said
Special Agent Graham
snuck her out.

30:21.650 --> 30:23.948
I don't know why he would
feel the need to be sneaky.

30:23.990 --> 30:28.256
He is registered as one
of her guardians. The irony.

30:28.290 --> 30:30.451
- Give us a minute here.

30:39.530 --> 30:41.361
How's the book coming?

30:41.400 --> 30:43.960
- There's plot holes.

30:44.010 --> 30:45.966
- Tell me how you're
filling them in.

30:46.010 --> 30:50.299
- Did Abigail Hobbs kill
Nick Boyle?

30:50.340 --> 30:52.900
- Why do you say that?

30:52.950 --> 30:57.978
- Abigail is one
of those very smart girls

30:58.020 --> 31:01.114
who hasn't quite figured out
that very smart girls grow up

31:01.160 --> 31:03.378
and know all the moves
they're making

31:03.420 --> 31:06.526
when they're trying
to hide something.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.199
What is Will Graham trying
to hide?

31:14.700 --> 31:17.669
- Sorry to barge in on you,
Doctor. Couldn't wait.

31:17.700 --> 31:21.932
You want to tell me what
the hell is going on between
Will Graham and Abigail Hobbs?

31:24.680 --> 31:28.548
- Will has been victim of many
unusual and irrational thoughts.

31:28.580 --> 31:32.118
- Has he acted
on these thoughts?
- Not that I'm aware of.

31:32.150 --> 31:35.119
Or he's aware of,
for that matter.

31:35.160 --> 31:38.288
But he has experienced periods
of lost time.

31:38.330 --> 31:40.321
- Yes, I've seen him confused
at crime scenes.

31:40.360 --> 31:42.920
I've seen him disoriented.

31:42.960 --> 31:45.428
- He may have been confused
because he was waking up.

31:45.470 --> 31:48.337
Might not have known where
he was or how he got there.

31:48.370 --> 31:49.928
- Waking up?

31:49.970 --> 31:51.938
- From a dissociated
personaIIty state.

31:51.970 --> 31:56.407
He would appear perfectly normal
and not remember a thing.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.579
But a fractured part of him
would.

31:58.610 --> 32:01.215
- And how long have you been
aware of this?

32:01.250 --> 32:03.218
- He's only recently started
to discuss these episodes.

32:03.250 --> 32:05.616
- Well, unless recently means
just before I walked

32:05.650 --> 32:08.084
into your office, you failed
to mention any of this to me.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.987
- Because I was trying to
determine if it was trauma and
stress from the work he's doing

32:11.030 --> 32:13.590
for you, or mental illness.
I thought it wise

32:13.630 --> 32:17.225
to be sure before making
any kind of claim about
Will Graham's sanity.

32:17.260 --> 32:20.388
- He's taken Abigail Hobbs.

32:20.430 --> 32:22.591
You have any idea
where they might be going?

32:22.640 --> 32:25.461
- No.
- We have evidence

32:25.510 --> 32:27.637
that she was involved
in some of her father's crimes.

32:27.670 --> 32:30.639
We just don't know how involved.
Is it possible that Will knew

32:30.680 --> 32:33.274
what Abigail was doing?
Is that why he's protecting her?

32:41.420 --> 32:43.980
- There's something
you should hear.

32:49.160 --> 32:53.392
How did you feel
seeing Marissa Schuur
impaled in his antler room?

32:53.430 --> 32:55.261
- (Will): Guilty.

32:55.300 --> 32:57.393
- (Hannibal): Because
you couldn't save her?

32:57.440 --> 32:59.658
- (Will): Because I felt
like I killed her.

33:04.450 --> 33:07.601
- Where was Will the night
that Marissa Schuur was killed?

33:09.620 --> 33:12.180
- He was supposed to be
in his hotel room.

33:12.220 --> 33:15.781
I knocked on his door.
He didn't answer.

33:15.820 --> 33:20.257
- We know he was
in Dr. Sutcliffe's office
the night that he was killed.

33:20.290 --> 33:23.691
And Will was the last person
to visit Georgia Madchen
before she died.

33:29.300 --> 33:33.600
This dissociative personality
state you say he goes into...

33:33.640 --> 33:35.631
Whose personality is it?

33:37.840 --> 33:40.809
- He said he got so close
to Garret Jacob Hobbs

33:40.850 --> 33:43.045
and what he had done...

33:44.850 --> 33:46.818
...that he felt
he was becoming him.

33:46.850 --> 33:50.183
- And now he has
Hobbs' daughter.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.353
- Who Hobbs intended to kill.

34:03.870 --> 34:06.065
I'm so sorry, Jack.

34:14.350 --> 34:16.614
(door opening and closing)

34:27.760 --> 34:30.194
- You look a little pasty.

34:30.230 --> 34:32.323
Maybe you shouldn't have checked
yourself out of the hospital.

34:32.370 --> 34:33.769
- I feel fine.

34:42.510 --> 34:45.502
- It would've been
my mom's birthday next week.

34:47.510 --> 34:49.774
We were gonna climb
Eagle Mountain to celebrate.

34:51.790 --> 34:54.418
Highest point
in Minnesota, but...

34:54.460 --> 34:57.418
it's not really that high.

34:57.460 --> 35:00.384
Less than three hours
to summIt. You can see

35:00.430 --> 35:03.319
Lake Superior from there.
- I could take you

35:03.360 --> 35:06.193
if-if you wanna go.

35:08.540 --> 35:11.703
- I think it would
just make me sad.

35:11.740 --> 35:15.574
Some places are
stained now.

35:15.610 --> 35:17.703
Some people too.

35:20.450 --> 35:22.441
I know I am.

35:26.950 --> 35:30.158
(crows cawing)

35:32.830 --> 35:35.298
(crows cawing)

36:01.990 --> 36:06.689
- The copycat knew your father
well enough to know
about this place.

36:06.730 --> 36:09.324
- You felt like you knew
my father.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.564
- I wanted
to understand him.

36:19.570 --> 36:22.175
I felt like I had
to understand him.

36:26.710 --> 36:29.645
- Do you ever hunt?

36:29.680 --> 36:32.649
- I fish.
- It's the same thing,

36:32.690 --> 36:34.658
isn't it?

36:34.690 --> 36:36.658
One you stalk,

36:36.690 --> 36:38.681
the other you lure.

36:47.870 --> 36:50.338
- Were you more a fisherman,
or a hunter?

36:50.370 --> 36:52.861
- My dad taught me how to hunt.

36:52.910 --> 36:55.208
- No, that's not
what I'm asking.

37:00.280 --> 37:02.248
All those girls your dad

37:02.280 --> 37:04.783
killed...

37:04.820 --> 37:07.789
Did you fish,

37:07.820 --> 37:10.380
or did you hunt, Abigail?

37:14.800 --> 37:16.791
- I was the lure.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.791
Did Hannibal tell you?

37:22.800 --> 37:24.768
- No, he didn't.

37:24.810 --> 37:29.304
- He said you'd protect me,
that you'd keep it a secret.

37:29.340 --> 37:32.343
(Will breathing heavily)

37:34.820 --> 37:37.516
(She gasps.)

37:37.550 --> 37:40.678
There is something wrong
with you.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.915
I think you're still sick.

37:42.960 --> 37:47.556
- Jack Crawford was right
about you.

37:47.590 --> 37:50.559
He knew.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.568
You killed Nick Boyle,

37:52.600 --> 37:55.330
and you helped your father kill
all of those girls.

37:55.370 --> 37:57.964
- No. I didn't help my dad
kill anybody.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.434
- No, you lured them.
You killed them.

38:00.470 --> 38:02.836
How many other people
have you killed?

38:02.880 --> 38:06.805
- Do you think I'm the copycat?
You think I killed Marissa?
- If you didn't kill her,

38:06.850 --> 38:09.739
Abigail, then somebody
you know did.

38:09.780 --> 38:12.681
- Ever think
that somebody could be you?

38:12.720 --> 38:14.950
You were there,
you saw Marissa.

38:14.990 --> 38:18.426
You knew about this place,
and there is something
wrong with you.

38:18.460 --> 38:20.678
- What?

38:20.730 --> 38:24.598
(Will breathing rapidly)

38:27.600 --> 38:29.966
- (woman): Sir. I'm afraid
you're gonna have to leave.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.730
We're preparing the cabin
for the next passengers.

38:37.140 --> 38:38.778
- I'm sorry, where...

38:38.810 --> 38:42.610
where are we?
- Dulles InternatIonal,

38:42.650 --> 38:45.710
Virginia.
- Was there a young
woman traveling with me?

38:45.750 --> 38:49.481
- All the other passengers are
disembarked. It's just you, sir.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.668
- Abigail.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.928
- What are you doing here?
- I was so worried about you.

39:38.970 --> 39:42.633
Will told me he was taking you
to Minnesota,

39:42.680 --> 39:45.046
and I strongly advised
against it.

39:45.080 --> 39:48.516
Where is Will?

39:48.550 --> 39:51.075
- I left him at the cabin.

39:53.090 --> 39:56.617
I didn't feel safe with him,
so I left him.

40:00.130 --> 40:02.098
He knows everything.

40:02.130 --> 40:05.167
- So does Jack Crawford.

40:10.900 --> 40:13.630
- If I run, they'll catch me,
won't they?

40:15.640 --> 40:17.733
You can't protect me anymore.

40:17.780 --> 40:20.146
- They'll arrest you
when they find you, yes.

40:20.180 --> 40:22.045
And Will.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.981
- Did he kill Marissa?

40:29.790 --> 40:31.781
- They will believe he did.

40:33.790 --> 40:36.190
They will believe he killed
others too.

40:42.070 --> 40:45.460
- Will always said whoever
called the house that morning

40:45.510 --> 40:47.501
was the serial killer.

40:50.210 --> 40:53.247
Why did you really call?

40:53.280 --> 40:56.044
- I wanted to warn your father

40:56.080 --> 40:59.117
that Will Graham was coming
for him.

40:59.150 --> 41:01.618
- Why?

41:05.690 --> 41:08.079
- I was curious
what would happen.

41:10.100 --> 41:13.627
I was curious what would happen
when I killed Marissa.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.666
I was curious
what you would do.

41:22.040 --> 41:24.747
- You wanted me
to kill Nick Boyle.

41:24.780 --> 41:26.998
- I was hoping.

41:27.050 --> 41:29.746
I_wanted to see how much
lIke your father you were.

41:29.780 --> 41:31.270
- Oh, my god.

41:31.320 --> 41:35.518
- Nicholas Boyle is more
important for you gutting him.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.516
He changed you, Abigail.

41:37.560 --> 41:40.654
That's more important
than the life he clamored after.

41:44.200 --> 41:46.191
- How many people
have you killed?

41:51.970 --> 41:55.076
- Many more than your father.

42:02.950 --> 42:05.680
- Are you going to kill me?

42:07.690 --> 42:09.851
- I'm so sorry, Abigail.

42:12.030 --> 42:15.898
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you
in this life.
