WEBVTT

00:18.700 --> 00:20.200
Thanks. Have a good one.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.100
Kill the engine, lady. Now.

01:12.100 --> 01:13.100
I'm not gonna ask you again.

01:13.200 --> 01:13.965
Turn it off!

01:14.000 --> 01:16.700
Police officer-
put the gun down now!

02:28.200 --> 02:29.900
Get out of the car!

03:14.500 --> 03:15.865
This is, uh, Duquesne.

03:15.900 --> 03:17.865
I've got an off-duty shooting

03:17.900 --> 03:19.600
I need to report Beachside and 11th.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.565
Requesting immediate assistance.

03:21.600 --> 03:26.300
There are two fatalities at the scene
and one suspect outstanding on foot.

03:42.900 --> 03:44.200
Horatio.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.100
What is this, Frank?

03:47.100 --> 03:49.065
Car's registered to a Mark Dowd.

03:49.100 --> 03:52.600
When Alexx moves the driver,
I'll see if the I.D.s match up.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.050
Passenger fled on foot.

03:54.085 --> 03:55.365
What about the K-9 unit?

03:55.400 --> 03:59.100
About five away- I got two birds
in the air, three block containment.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.100
Also talked to the store owner.

04:01.135 --> 04:02.265
Did he see anything?

04:02.300 --> 04:05.200
Just aftermath- Calleigh
and what's left of the store.

04:05.235 --> 04:06.400
All right. Who's the victim?

04:06.435 --> 04:07.465
One of his customers.

04:07.500 --> 04:11.900
He was waiting on her, checking inventory
in the back when this car rolled in.

04:14.300 --> 04:17.000
So she was an innocent bystander.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.200
It's looking that way.

04:20.899 --> 04:23.000
We're leaning hard on
witnesses in the neighborhood.

04:23.100 --> 04:26.000
Calleigh couldn't give us a
description of the male suspect.

04:28.100 --> 04:31.500
Staring down the barrel
of a gun mind plays tricks.

04:31.535 --> 04:33.800
Well, we've got a few of our own.

05:25.828 --> 05:27.328
You know, I can't believe this.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.193
Who'd try to run over Calleigh?

05:29.228 --> 05:32.828
It is too soon to tell,
Mr. Wolfe, but we must...

05:33.928 --> 05:36.628
we must document it all.

05:48.928 --> 05:51.028
H, I got the, uh...

05:51.728 --> 05:53.093
I got the victim's I.D. here:

05:53.128 --> 05:55.228
Valerie Gaynor, Brickell middle school.

05:55.263 --> 05:58.128
I think she was a...teacher there.

06:09.928 --> 06:11.793
Somebody had a sweet tooth.

06:11.828 --> 06:15.328
There's enough candy here to
feed every citizen of Miami.

06:16.928 --> 06:18.828
You got something, H?

06:19.128 --> 06:22.328
This could be blood from our fugitive.

06:25.928 --> 06:27.228
Could give us an I.D..

06:27.328 --> 06:29.028
Get it to the lab, please.

06:33.928 --> 06:35.928
I don't know what happened.

06:38.128 --> 06:41.728
I was just at a brunch down the street.

06:43.328 --> 06:45.428
You gonna be okay?

06:55.028 --> 06:57.028
There was a woman in that building.

07:00.828 --> 07:02.528
An innocent woman.

07:03.928 --> 07:05.328
Listen, Calleigh.

07:05.728 --> 07:06.693
I got to ask you something.

07:06.728 --> 07:08.728
I don't want you to
take it the wrong way.

07:08.828 --> 07:12.228
I know you're off duty,
but...have you been drinking?

07:16.728 --> 07:19.628
You know, the paramedic
asked me that question.

07:22.828 --> 07:26.328
I had two mimosas, but it doesn't
have anything to do with what happened.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.028
It's my day off.

07:29.028 --> 07:30.228
You don't have to explain it to me.

07:30.263 --> 07:32.428
I understand, I believe you.

07:32.728 --> 07:35.528
It's just not me that
you got to worry about.

08:00.428 --> 08:02.993
Couldn't extend the courtesy
of doing this in private, rick?

08:03.028 --> 08:06.828
The first officer on the scene reported
objective symptoms of alcohol consumption.

08:07.228 --> 08:08.493
You were H.B.D.

08:08.528 --> 08:13.028
We won't get an accurate breathalyzer
waiting around for another room to open up.

08:21.628 --> 08:23.428
blood alcohol
is point-oh-four.

08:23.528 --> 08:24.593
That's under the legal limit.

08:24.628 --> 08:28.828
Yes, but alcohol dissipates
at point five ounces per hour.

08:28.928 --> 08:32.528
So the question becomes, what was
this number during the incident?

08:32.563 --> 08:35.028
You couldn't provide a
description of the suspect.

08:35.428 --> 08:39.193
He was carrying a smith & wesson 459,

08:39.227 --> 08:42.928
wood grain grip with an adjustable
rear sight at my head, rick!

08:42.962 --> 08:44.493
If my judgment had been impaired,

08:44.528 --> 08:47.128
I wouldn't be here
now- I'd be dead.

08:47.428 --> 08:50.228
Right now, two other people are.

08:50.528 --> 08:53.628
I'm putting you under
administrative tactical review.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.195
That's humiliating.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.728
This is humiliating.

08:57.628 --> 09:00.678
I'm going to ask you to
remove yourself from this case

09:00.713 --> 09:03.728
and refrain from all field
work until further notice.

09:38.628 --> 09:41.328
I'm here for the blood that
Horatio found in the bad guys' car.

09:41.428 --> 09:44.128
Yeah, I got a profile, and I'm
running it through codis now.

09:45.478 --> 09:47.828
You know, I have to say, as soon
as I finish my firearms training,

09:47.863 --> 09:50.143
I'm going to get an off-duty gun,
because it is scary out there.

09:50.178 --> 09:54.878
Not as scary as being investigated by the
department for what you do off the clock.

09:56.178 --> 10:00.178
Did you, uh, did you know that
Stetler has Calleigh under review?

10:00.213 --> 10:01.478
For what?

10:01.678 --> 10:04.678
Questions about her
blood-alcohol content.

10:04.713 --> 10:06.978
Have the questions been answered?

10:08.978 --> 10:10.778
Not yet.

10:10.978 --> 10:14.278
In the meantime, we have to do
whatever we can to help her, I guess.

10:17.178 --> 10:17.978
okay.

10:18.078 --> 10:20.778
The blood from the car
belongs to Pete Morton.

10:20.813 --> 10:23.578
He's got three convictions for assault.

10:23.778 --> 10:26.378
Well, he's running from
something a lot bigger now.

10:26.478 --> 10:27.578
I'm gonna call tripp and let him know.

10:27.613 --> 10:28.878
Thanks.

10:35.578 --> 10:37.178
That's quite a mess.

10:37.878 --> 10:38.543
What's it have to do with me?

10:38.578 --> 10:41.228
We recovered your blood
from that vehicle, Pete.

10:41.263 --> 10:43.878
Yeah, well I was in
that car against my will.

10:43.913 --> 10:45.743
The other guy, Mark, was at the wheel.

10:45.778 --> 10:48.978
Yes. You pointed a weapon
at one of my officers.

10:49.013 --> 10:50.078
You can't prove that.

10:50.178 --> 10:53.978
Your Smith & Wesson matches
that officer's description.

10:56.678 --> 10:58.678
Look, I was never gonna use it.

10:59.078 --> 11:00.778
It was to scare her.

11:00.878 --> 11:03.378
Next thing you know, she's got
a gun in my face, threatening me.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.578
She identified herself
as a police officer.

11:05.613 --> 11:07.843
No. I never heard that.

11:07.878 --> 11:08.643
We saw she was packing heat.

11:08.678 --> 11:10.378
We just wanted to get out of there.

11:11.978 --> 11:14.078
then the damn big rig blocked us in.

11:15.278 --> 11:18.978
We turned around, and there she was in
the middle of the road, shooting at us.

11:23.278 --> 11:25.378
We backed off, man; she didn't.

11:26.778 --> 11:28.578
This is about the time I ask
for representation, isn't it?

11:28.678 --> 11:30.428
You qualify for a public defender.

11:30.463 --> 11:32.143
No, I don't need one of those.

11:32.178 --> 11:34.478
I'm talking personal injury lawyer.

11:34.578 --> 11:36.378
This whole thing's
messed me up real bad-

11:36.413 --> 11:38.495
whiplash, emotional distress.

11:38.530 --> 11:40.578
And I'm just getting started.

11:43.580 --> 11:44.645
This isn't personal, Horatio.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.830
You're after a member of my team, rick.

11:46.865 --> 11:48.980
So you think her actions are justified?

11:49.015 --> 11:50.580
She was in the line of fire.

11:50.615 --> 11:51.380
You don't know that.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.780
Pete Morton said they
were fleeing the scene.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.845
He is a criminal and not
a reliable witness, rick.

11:55.880 --> 11:59.280
Calleigh's blood-alcohol was a
point-oh-four an hour after the incident.

11:59.380 --> 12:00.245
What makes her reliable?

12:00.280 --> 12:02.245
How about her near-perfect career?

12:02.280 --> 12:06.480
That won't hold up much in a wrongful
death suit against the county.

12:06.580 --> 12:08.580
So this is about the money.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.880
They're going to say she escalated this

12:10.915 --> 12:12.880
and she took the law into her own hands.

12:12.980 --> 12:15.380
But we are going to prove she didn't.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.880
You know I'm not
supposed to be down here.

12:21.980 --> 12:25.480
Calleigh, honey, they said
you couldn't work the field.

12:25.515 --> 12:28.380
Does this look like
the field to you, baby?

12:30.280 --> 12:31.880
What have you got?

12:31.980 --> 12:37.580
Valerie Gaynor's injuries are confined
to the maxillary and upper neck.

12:37.780 --> 12:40.480
There were no fractures
in her lower extremities?

12:40.580 --> 12:41.980
Nothing.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.245
That is odd...

12:44.280 --> 12:47.680
and completely inconsistent with a
pedestrian motor vehicle accident.

12:47.780 --> 12:48.845
Precisely.

12:48.880 --> 12:52.045
It rules out pedestrian rotation,

12:52.080 --> 12:57.480
which means she was already down when
that car crashed through the storefront.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.380
thank you.

13:04.280 --> 13:08.080
I know I should feel relieved, but
still, something killed this woman.

13:08.180 --> 13:09.680
Someone.

13:10.480 --> 13:15.980
Facial bruising says she definitely
suffered a blow to the head.

13:16.015 --> 13:18.880
Likely put her into respiratory arrest.

13:18.980 --> 13:23.080
Any idea what kind of a head injury
would allow a person to stop breathing?

13:23.115 --> 13:25.347
Oh, well, I've seen this before.

13:25.382 --> 13:27.580
Atlantooccipital dislocation.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.280
Internal decapitation?

13:29.380 --> 13:30.480
That's right.

13:34.480 --> 13:38.080
This girl was murdered.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.880
What about a weapon?

13:40.280 --> 13:41.880
It wasn't a fist,

13:41.980 --> 13:47.780
but whatever it was, it left a faint
striped pattern on her left cheek.

13:48.080 --> 13:51.680
Alexx, there's some sort of a brown
trace on her clavicle- it's not blood.

13:51.715 --> 13:54.080
Already sent it to trace, honey.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.580
Thank you, Alexx.

13:58.680 --> 13:59.980
Yeah.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.880
you think that security
camera caught anything?

15:43.980 --> 15:45.680
Horatio's talking to
the owner right now.

15:45.715 --> 15:47.145
He'll find out.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.145
So I just talked to Alexx,

15:48.180 --> 15:50.680
and she said there was a striped
pattern on the victim's face.

15:50.780 --> 15:51.745
I've looked all over this place.

15:51.780 --> 15:54.380
I haven't found anything
that resembles that.

15:54.680 --> 15:57.180
Killer may have walked off
with it, whatever it is.

15:57.215 --> 16:00.580
I, uh, I got some other bad news, pal.

16:02.080 --> 16:05.280
We got to collect
everything, all of the debris.

16:06.180 --> 16:07.345
are you kidding?

16:07.380 --> 16:09.580
No. Might be something in
here that could help us.

16:09.680 --> 16:14.980
You realize by the time that we're done doing
this we'll be collecting our pensions, right?

16:16.680 --> 16:18.380
I'll get the shovels.

16:21.180 --> 16:23.580
The security camera is just for show.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.580
I got lazy on the maintenance,
figured the threat was enough.

16:26.680 --> 16:27.945
Well, apparently not.

16:27.980 --> 16:30.780
A woman died in your store.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.180
I know, lieutenant...

16:36.280 --> 16:37.045
but I'm sorry.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.880
I wasn't the one who parked
a car in the middle of it.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.280
She was dead before that.

16:43.780 --> 16:45.980
What, you mean murdered?

16:46.080 --> 16:50.380
You were the only one in there
before the crash. Correct?

16:50.980 --> 16:52.480
Besides the woman, yeah.

16:52.515 --> 16:53.880
I just opened.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.880
She was my first customer of the day.

16:55.980 --> 16:59.180
I went in the back to grab her
a few pair of shoes to try on.

16:59.215 --> 17:00.345
She was alive.

17:00.380 --> 17:01.880
How long did that take?

17:01.915 --> 17:03.580
Couple of minutes.

17:03.680 --> 17:06.579
So you were the last
one to see her alive.

17:07.980 --> 17:09.980
I was just trying to run my business.

17:10.015 --> 17:11.780
Join the club.

17:43.403 --> 17:48.903
Um... my review of your tactics this
morning isn't going to reflect well on you

17:49.003 --> 17:50.903
if you continue to lie to me.

17:50.938 --> 17:52.068
Lie?

17:52.103 --> 17:53.468
I haven't lied about anything.

17:53.503 --> 17:56.503
I asked you explicitly if
alcohol impeded your judgment.

17:56.603 --> 17:58.603
And I said that it didn't.

17:59.603 --> 18:01.103
Really?

18:02.903 --> 18:06.003
This is a receipt from
the bar at the restaurant.

18:06.103 --> 18:07.903
I told you I had two drinks.

18:09.203 --> 18:12.003
Are you sure it wasn't six?

18:17.503 --> 18:18.853
They're not mine.

18:18.888 --> 18:20.203
Whose are they?

18:20.303 --> 18:21.468
Friends.

18:21.503 --> 18:22.803
Can I have names for verification?

18:22.903 --> 18:24.903
No, you can't; I'm not
going to include them.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.068
They have nothing to do with it.

18:26.103 --> 18:29.068
Listen, Calleigh, this is
not my personal witch hunt.

18:29.103 --> 18:33.703
The county is sick and tired of paying
out millions on wrongful death suits.

18:33.738 --> 18:39.303
These civil attorneys consider
everything and everybody fair game.

18:39.338 --> 18:41.603
Apparently, so do you.

18:52.603 --> 18:54.103
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:54.203 --> 18:57.503
If Stetler finds out that I'm
here, he will have my head.

18:57.903 --> 18:59.903
Well, I don't need you
to do any field work.

19:00.003 --> 19:01.703
I just want to talk.

19:03.403 --> 19:04.403
And if I'm gonna work the case,

19:04.503 --> 19:06.803
it'd be better if I hear it from
you than read it from the report.

19:06.838 --> 19:09.503
Well, technically, I don't
know that you can do that.

19:09.538 --> 19:10.368
What do you mean?

19:10.403 --> 19:14.003
Well, you got to the restaurant
this morning before I did, right?

19:14.038 --> 19:14.503
Yeah.

19:14.603 --> 19:17.303
So, I know about the drinks
you ordered before I got there.

19:17.403 --> 19:19.503
Stetler showed me your receipt.

19:22.903 --> 19:27.003
Well, I ran into some
buddies, bought a round.

19:30.503 --> 19:36.003
Jake, you know that my dad is
a fairly accomplished drinker.

19:36.038 --> 19:40.503
And I have heard every
excuse and half-truth so...

19:40.703 --> 19:42.603
you want to just tell me the real story?

19:42.703 --> 19:44.468
What difference does it make?

19:44.503 --> 19:49.503
The difference is that your four drinks
brought my actions today in question.

19:55.203 --> 19:59.303
Calleigh, when I used to work undercover,
I had to do a few things that...

20:00.303 --> 20:04.903
I'm not proud of, but I
am not like your old man.

20:06.203 --> 20:12.803
And this morning, I was just a guy, an
off-duty cop trying to enjoy himself.

20:14.403 --> 20:18.503
I just don't know that you're the on-duty
cop who needs to be working this case.

20:24.203 --> 20:27.503
Hey, that brown trace that Alexx
recovered from Valerie Gaynor's shoulder?

20:27.538 --> 20:30.203
Whole kaleidoscope of ingredients.

20:31.903 --> 20:36.703
Cadmium sulfoselenide, zinc
oxide, manganese dioxide.

20:36.738 --> 20:38.003
What's it all mean?

20:38.103 --> 20:40.403
It's orange, white and brown pigments...

20:40.438 --> 20:41.768
for coloring paint.

20:41.803 --> 20:43.653
Looks like an oil and acrylic base.

20:43.688 --> 20:45.468
Vic didn't have anything on her hands?

20:45.503 --> 20:48.503
No, so I think it was transferred
to her by somebody else.

20:49.803 --> 20:52.368
- Ryan said the victim was a schoolteacher, right?
- Yeah.

20:52.403 --> 20:54.503
So what are you thinking? Maybe
somebody from the art department?

20:54.538 --> 20:55.468
I'm thinking it's worth a try.

20:55.503 --> 20:57.303
I'll call the school, see
if I come up with a name.

20:57.338 --> 20:58.103
Great.

21:04.703 --> 21:06.603
Training ground sporting goods.

21:06.638 --> 21:08.468
No, I've never been there. Why?

21:08.503 --> 21:11.703
It's where we found
Valerie Gaynor's body.

21:14.003 --> 21:16.503
Did you two have a relationship?

21:17.103 --> 21:19.003
I substitute teach.

21:19.303 --> 21:22.103
When I'm here, sometimes...

21:22.803 --> 21:24.903
we're friendly.

21:26.003 --> 21:26.903
Why do you ask?

21:27.003 --> 21:34.103
Because we found paint just like the paint
on your hands on her body during autopsy.

21:42.303 --> 21:45.303
Is there something you'd
like to tell me, Mr. Keppling?

21:48.403 --> 21:51.603
She-she came over from the
science lab this morning.

21:51.703 --> 21:56.003
She seemed on edge, so I
tried to help her relax.

21:58.403 --> 22:00.103
You seem wound up.

22:00.203 --> 22:01.703
Everything okay?

22:02.003 --> 22:03.603
Yeah, I'm fine.

22:11.903 --> 22:13.403
Mmm, that feels good.

22:20.403 --> 22:23.403
You're describing a shoulder massage.

22:24.803 --> 22:26.103
Yes.

22:26.203 --> 22:31.103
Was it inappropriate for two
colleagues in the workplace? Probably.

22:31.203 --> 22:33.403
But we were...

22:33.503 --> 22:36.403
secretly seeing each other, so...

22:36.438 --> 22:39.303
we'd sneak a moment here and there.

22:39.503 --> 22:41.303
What was she upset about?

22:41.403 --> 22:43.003
She wouldn't tell me.

22:44.503 --> 22:46.003
I saw her after first period.

22:46.038 --> 22:47.103
And that was it.

22:50.303 --> 22:52.003
Somebody call 911, please.

22:52.103 --> 22:52.803
What's her name, Dave?

22:52.838 --> 22:53.503
Beth. Her name's Beth.

22:53.603 --> 22:55.303
Check that backpack,
Dave, for medication.

22:55.338 --> 22:56.203
Beth?

22:56.303 --> 22:57.068
Beth, hang in there.

22:57.103 --> 22:58.303
Help is on the way, sweetheart.

22:58.338 --> 23:00.603
Lieutenant, what is this?

23:00.703 --> 23:01.703
That's not medication.

23:01.738 --> 23:02.703
That could be heroin.

23:02.803 --> 23:03.903
She's overdosing.

23:03.938 --> 23:04.803
Beth?

23:10.803 --> 23:13.803
This is the murdered teacher
Valerie Gaynor's desk.

23:14.303 --> 23:16.603
Let's hope it can tell us something.

23:36.203 --> 23:37.403
Okay, bingo.

23:37.503 --> 23:39.603
Got some empty drug baggies.

23:39.703 --> 23:42.703
Some empty pen casings for snorting.

23:44.603 --> 23:45.768
H, this is cheese.

23:45.803 --> 23:47.703
Latest drug to hit the streets.

23:47.803 --> 23:49.703
Heroin mixed with cold medicine.

23:49.738 --> 23:50.603
These are called "bumps."

23:50.638 --> 23:52.468
Two bucks apiece.

23:52.503 --> 23:55.403
It's cheap and lethal.

23:55.803 --> 23:57.203
What's this?

23:58.103 --> 23:59.303
Oh, H, you're not gonna believe this.

23:59.338 --> 24:00.768
This is her paid and owes.

24:00.803 --> 24:03.003
This is every drug deal she ever made.

24:03.103 --> 24:05.168
Friday at the soccer
field- two bags.

24:05.203 --> 24:08.403
Tuesday on the third
floor hallway, three bags.

24:11.303 --> 24:15.003
This looks like a criminal complaint
from a week ago for trespassing.

24:15.103 --> 24:16.403
Who's the victim?

24:16.503 --> 24:17.668
Charlie Sheridan.

24:17.703 --> 24:20.703
His brother found her in the backyard.

24:21.303 --> 24:24.003
Looks like Valerie was
pushing her drugs too hard.

24:24.103 --> 24:26.303
Well, then maybe he pushed back.

24:31.203 --> 24:34.203
Yeah, my, uh... my little brother's
in miss Gaynor's class now.

24:34.303 --> 24:38.503
I had her like five years
ago, and she was creepy then.

24:38.603 --> 24:39.603
What do you mean, she was creepy?

24:39.703 --> 24:42.003
I don't know. Just,
uh... just nosey, I guess.

24:42.103 --> 24:43.503
I never trusted her.

24:43.803 --> 24:45.903
Uh, what were you doing
this morning, Charlie?

24:46.003 --> 24:47.603
I was in class.

24:47.703 --> 24:49.703
The only reason I'm here is
'cause my folks are in the Bahamas

24:49.738 --> 24:51.320
so I gotta stick around for him.

24:51.355 --> 24:52.903
I don't need you to watch me.

24:52.938 --> 24:54.703
Trust me, Logan, you do.

24:55.303 --> 24:57.053
Uh, Logan, let me ask you a question.

24:57.088 --> 24:58.803
What did you think of miss Gaynor?

24:58.903 --> 25:00.903
She'd have me stay
after school sometimes.

25:01.003 --> 25:03.868
For like study sessions and stuff.

25:03.903 --> 25:06.603
Uh, oh, you guys also had a criminal
complaint against her, is that right?

25:06.703 --> 25:08.268
She, uh, she trespassed?

25:08.303 --> 25:12.303
Yeah, we, uh, we got home and we
saw her out here out by the flowers.

25:12.338 --> 25:14.503
Sneaking around my backyard.

25:14.603 --> 25:16.703
Way too weird. Freaked me out.

25:16.803 --> 25:19.903
So, I told her the next time
it wouldn't end so civilized.

25:20.203 --> 25:22.503
Maybe today was that next time.

25:27.203 --> 25:29.903
Hey, Logan, why don't you go
inside and watch some T.V., Okay?

25:29.938 --> 25:31.003
Okay.

25:31.203 --> 25:32.503
Thanks, Logan.

25:35.003 --> 25:36.503
Look, you can check with
my high school, all right?

25:36.538 --> 25:37.268
That's where I was.

25:37.303 --> 25:40.103
You got busted for possession
a year ago, isn't that right?

25:40.138 --> 25:41.503
That didn't have anything
to do with Valerie Gaynor,

25:41.603 --> 25:44.003
'cause we just found
narcotics in her desk drawer.

25:44.803 --> 25:46.303
I got caught with a bag of weed.

25:46.338 --> 25:47.803
I was holding it for a friend.

25:47.903 --> 25:49.203
The cops got it all wrong.

25:49.303 --> 25:51.703
Well, I guarantee you this, Charlie...

25:52.003 --> 25:54.203
this time we're gonna get it right.

25:56.903 --> 25:58.703
I've been reading
Valerie Gaynor's journal;

25:58.738 --> 25:59.868
something's not adding up here.

25:59.903 --> 26:02.703
Yeah, like why would you start
preying on eighth graders?

26:02.803 --> 26:05.168
That's the thing. I don't think she was.

26:05.203 --> 26:09.103
Drug dealers, they write in
codes- safehouses, streets.

26:09.138 --> 26:10.968
There's no mention of that in here.

26:11.003 --> 26:14.668
There's no mention of cash amounts,
suppliers, anything like that.

26:14.703 --> 26:19.103
Sounds to me like she was trying to build
up evidence to shut down an operation.

26:20.003 --> 26:22.003
Yeah, you got anything good?

26:22.103 --> 26:25.603
Well, yeah, I got spectra from the
paraphernalia you found in her desk.

26:25.703 --> 26:30.103
And it confirms the presence of everything
necessary to manufacture a narcotic like cheese.

26:30.138 --> 26:32.503
Except one little extra.

26:34.403 --> 26:35.703
Methyl anthranilate?

26:35.803 --> 26:38.803
It's a natural ester
that's found in grapes.

26:38.838 --> 26:41.803
And they use it to flavor
soda, gum and candy.

26:41.838 --> 26:44.003
Oh, my god. Flavored narcotics.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.803
Yeah, for kids.

27:18.603 --> 27:19.503
Yeah, that makes so much sense,

27:19.603 --> 27:21.453
because I found candy
in the back of the Dodge.

27:21.488 --> 27:23.303
This is the hottest lead.
I'm gonna go with this.

27:23.338 --> 27:24.303
What are you gonna do?

27:24.703 --> 27:25.568
What am I gonna do?

27:25.603 --> 27:28.103
I'm gonna finish the
job that Valerie started.

27:31.403 --> 27:33.603
Tell me about the drugs, Pete.

27:33.638 --> 27:34.820
There's nothing to tell.

27:34.855 --> 27:35.968
We found candy in your car.

27:36.003 --> 27:38.303
And you're using it to
cut it with your product

27:38.338 --> 27:40.768
so that you can market it to children.

27:40.803 --> 27:44.803
Was Valerie Gaynor on
to your operation, Pete?

27:46.203 --> 27:47.203
I don't know who that is.

27:47.303 --> 27:50.003
She's a science teacher
at Brickell middle school.

27:50.103 --> 27:52.168
And she was compiling
evidence to bring you down.

27:52.203 --> 27:56.403
And was she going to bring you
down with that evidence, Pete?

27:56.438 --> 27:58.903
I threaten your CSI
chick with a lawsuit,

27:59.003 --> 28:01.603
and you're gonna pay me
back with a murder charge?

28:03.803 --> 28:05.568
I- I'm not saying another word.

28:05.603 --> 28:09.503
There is a 13-year-old girl in the
hospital that is probably going to die.

28:09.603 --> 28:12.003
I hope you're ready to live with that.

28:25.684 --> 28:27.784
So, why are we back at the car again?

28:28.184 --> 28:30.684
Because we didn't find the
murder weapon at the store, right?

28:30.784 --> 28:32.584
No. The killer left the scene with it.

28:32.619 --> 28:34.084
But we don't know that.

28:34.119 --> 28:35.884
Maybe the car did.

28:39.684 --> 28:42.434
Looks like there's a
defect in the floorboard.

28:42.469 --> 28:45.184
All right, tear the carpet
out, see what we find.

28:45.219 --> 28:46.184
all right

28:56.784 --> 28:59.584
Is that a piece of broken suspension?

28:59.684 --> 29:01.149
No, I doubt it.

29:01.184 --> 29:02.584
This is an American muscle car.

29:02.684 --> 29:03.684
It's made of steel.

29:03.784 --> 29:05.384
That looks like chrome.

29:35.384 --> 29:37.484
what is that, a dumbbell?

29:37.584 --> 29:40.349
Part of a display from inside the store.

29:40.384 --> 29:42.784
So, when the car crashed
through, the tire kicked it up.

29:46.784 --> 29:49.984
Alexx said Valerie had striped
impressions on the side of her face, right?

29:50.019 --> 29:51.149
Yeah.

29:51.184 --> 29:52.284
Take a look at those threads.

29:52.319 --> 29:53.349
Same pattern.

29:53.384 --> 29:55.149
I think we found our murder weapon.

29:55.184 --> 29:58.084
Yeah, and there's a latent
print on the top of it.

29:58.184 --> 30:00.484
Let's see if we can
find out whose that is.

30:05.284 --> 30:07.049
Look, guys, I'm the owner.

30:07.084 --> 30:09.284
Of course my prints are on everything.

30:09.319 --> 30:12.084
It's a dumbbell from my store.

30:12.284 --> 30:14.449
Who do you think sets up the displays?

30:14.484 --> 30:18.684
I don't know. Maybe it was the same guy
who installs video cameras for decoration.

30:19.584 --> 30:22.684
Look, I can explain this awaybe
cause I didn't kill that woman.

30:22.784 --> 30:23.949
You're wasting your time.

30:23.984 --> 30:25.584
All right, well, do you mind, André,

30:25.684 --> 30:28.684
if I "waste my time"
in your cash register?

30:29.284 --> 30:30.184
Go ahead.

30:30.284 --> 30:31.684
Thank you.

30:37.384 --> 30:40.484
Some serious cash here, André.

30:41.084 --> 30:43.884
You sure Valerie was your
only customer this morning?

30:43.919 --> 30:46.484
Because we know she
didn't purchase anything.

30:47.984 --> 30:50.384
There was one other, all right?

30:50.419 --> 30:51.784
Do tell.

30:52.284 --> 30:53.384
There was this dude.

30:53.484 --> 30:54.384
Laid down some cash.

30:54.484 --> 30:56.184
He bought 11 pair of shoes.

30:56.284 --> 30:58.484
What else did he come
here to get, André? Drugs?

30:58.519 --> 31:00.984
I don't do anything illegal here.

31:01.684 --> 31:04.949
so, André, if you're not
doing anything illegal,

31:04.984 --> 31:09.984
then why does training ground sporting goods
come up in Valerie Gaynor's journal several times?

31:10.984 --> 31:12.384
Gonna confiscate all of your proceeds,

31:12.484 --> 31:15.084
and then you're going
to take a ride with us.

31:36.384 --> 31:39.084
Hey, why'd you want me to come down?

31:39.284 --> 31:43.584
Pete Morton told Horatio that there
was a truck parked at this corner,

31:43.619 --> 31:44.949
blocking their escape route.

31:44.984 --> 31:47.184
Yeah, I told Stetler
that it wasn't there,

31:47.284 --> 31:49.484
but then again, he thinks I was drunk.

31:49.884 --> 31:51.784
Well, you were right.

31:52.184 --> 31:54.884
Take a look at this bullet strike, yeah?

31:55.384 --> 31:57.384
I pulled this out of it.

31:57.484 --> 31:58.984
Look familiar?

32:01.084 --> 32:03.349
Yeah, it's a.45.

32:03.384 --> 32:05.184
I'm willing to bet it's yours.

32:05.484 --> 32:08.684
It missed the suspect's
car and it struck the tree.

32:27.984 --> 32:30.584
you know, that proves there was no
way that there was a truck there.

32:30.684 --> 32:32.749
Proves Pete Morton's story is B.S.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.384
They weren't looking for an
escape route. They had one.

32:36.284 --> 32:38.684
They were coming back to kill you.

32:39.384 --> 32:41.084
Stetler's wrong.

32:42.784 --> 32:44.884
You did what you had to do.

32:45.184 --> 32:46.084
Thanks, Eric.

32:46.119 --> 32:46.984
Don't thank me.

32:47.084 --> 32:50.684
Thank, uh... thank Jake.

32:52.384 --> 32:55.184
He just called me down here
and asked me to handle it.

32:55.984 --> 32:57.484
Jake, what did you find?

32:57.519 --> 32:59.149
Credibility.

32:59.184 --> 33:01.934
But I'm gonna need you to
recover the evidence, though.

33:01.969 --> 33:04.684
If I show you what I got,
can you write up the report?

33:04.719 --> 33:06.984
Yeah, man, whatever you need.

33:07.084 --> 33:08.084
Thanks.

33:08.984 --> 33:11.084
Jake asked you to do this?

33:11.184 --> 33:13.784
Guess he's a stand-up guy, after all.

33:38.584 --> 33:41.684
Do we still think that Charlie
Sheridan is good for this?

33:41.784 --> 33:43.649
Uh, no, not necessarily.

33:43.684 --> 33:46.684
We think he was dealing drugs, but we
can't tie him to Valerie Gaynor's death.

33:46.784 --> 33:50.284
And, uh, harding, the guy who
owned the sporting goods store

33:50.319 --> 33:54.184
he explained away his print
on the uh, murder weapon.

33:54.984 --> 33:56.984
We got to put somebody
else at this crime scene.

33:57.084 --> 33:58.484
But I've been through half
of this debris already,

33:58.584 --> 34:00.184
and it's given me nothing.

34:00.284 --> 34:01.684
What about these shards of glass?

34:01.719 --> 34:03.049
It's, um...

34:03.084 --> 34:05.984
it's possible that somebody could've put a
print on them when they were entering the store.

34:06.019 --> 34:08.884
Yeah, I dusted some of
the bigger shards, but...

34:09.184 --> 34:11.284
jump in, feel free.

34:15.784 --> 34:17.984
Here's a little something.

34:19.083 --> 34:20.684
Bet they don't sell that
at the sporting goods store.

34:20.719 --> 34:23.083
Somebody would've had
to walk in with it.

34:23.119 --> 34:23.949
What is it?

34:23.984 --> 34:25.748
It's a tie tack.

34:25.784 --> 34:26.984
And it's got a little engraving on it.

34:27.018 --> 34:29.484
Says "S.M. Prep, faculty."

34:30.684 --> 34:33.184
Well, the only teacher that
we know in this case is dead.

34:33.284 --> 34:34.884
And she taught at Brickell.

34:36.384 --> 34:39.284
There is another
teacher that gets around.

34:50.491 --> 34:52.291
Does that belong to you?

34:52.491 --> 34:55.491
What's that, part of a tie tack?

34:55.525 --> 34:57.056
Sorry. Not mine.

34:57.091 --> 34:58.991
Remove your tie, please.

35:09.191 --> 35:11.591
I would assume that's the rest of it.

35:14.791 --> 35:16.091
Okay.

35:16.691 --> 35:17.491
Must be.

35:17.591 --> 35:19.656
I probably lost it someplace.

35:19.691 --> 35:24.191
We found it next to Valerie's body in
a store you claim you'd never been in.

35:25.491 --> 35:26.891
How is this related to Valerie?

35:26.991 --> 35:30.991
She discovered, Mr. Keppling, that
you were selling drugs to kids.

35:31.591 --> 35:32.056
What?

35:32.091 --> 35:37.891
I have a 13-year-old girl fighting for
her life as we speak in Miami general.

35:38.491 --> 35:39.256
That's ridiculous.

35:39.291 --> 35:42.691
- You can't connect me to an overdose.
- No, but your gunman, Pete Morton, can.

35:42.726 --> 35:44.756
And he's facing 25 to life.

35:44.791 --> 35:47.391
He's gonna tell me anything I want.

35:52.391 --> 35:54.791
Pete was my heroin connect.

35:54.891 --> 35:57.191
So, he brought it to
you, and you mixed it.

35:57.291 --> 36:01.491
Yeah, it was all the different flavors
that got the kids to like the heroin.

36:01.591 --> 36:04.291
You were distributing to children.

36:04.391 --> 36:06.191
I didn't distribute.

36:06.291 --> 36:09.491
- That's what the kids were for.
- Enticed them with sneakers.

36:13.491 --> 36:17.691
Yeah, they'd sell the heroin,
then I'd pay them off with shoes.

36:18.791 --> 36:20.591
K- lines.

36:20.691 --> 36:24.991
I'd buy ten, 15 pair at a
discount, stuff the dope inside.

36:25.391 --> 36:26.191
Perfect.

36:26.291 --> 36:29.591
Until Valerie traced it all
the way to André's store.

36:43.091 --> 36:44.591
Yeah.

36:44.691 --> 36:46.491
He said she confronted him.

36:48.791 --> 36:50.156
I know what these are.

36:50.191 --> 36:51.941
You're moving drugs with
these shoes, aren't you?

36:51.976 --> 36:53.691
Lady, I don't know what
you're talking about.

36:53.791 --> 36:55.991
You're selling drugs to the kids.

36:56.091 --> 36:56.691
Hey, André.

36:56.791 --> 36:58.391
This my order?

36:58.891 --> 37:00.191
Dave.

37:00.291 --> 37:01.991
What are you doing here?

37:03.691 --> 37:05.291
It's you.

37:07.691 --> 37:09.091
The kids get it from you.

37:09.191 --> 37:10.691
Valerie. It's not like that.

37:10.726 --> 37:12.191
I'm reporting you to the police.

37:14.291 --> 37:17.491
I couldn't let her
take that any further.

37:18.791 --> 37:19.891
You're not going anywhere.

37:19.991 --> 37:22.491
Let go of me!

37:30.291 --> 37:32.391
what the hell were you thinking?

37:32.491 --> 37:34.591
Get her body out of here now.

37:34.691 --> 37:35.491
Get her out back.

37:35.526 --> 37:36.791
Let's go.

37:38.491 --> 37:39.991
You think that woman saw us?

37:40.026 --> 37:41.491
We can't risk any eyewitnesses.

37:41.526 --> 37:43.191
Take care of it.

37:51.191 --> 37:53.056
Yeah, they took care of it.

37:53.091 --> 37:55.741
Idiots brought you
cops to our front door.

37:55.776 --> 37:58.391
Valerie Gaynor knew what you were doing,

37:58.491 --> 38:01.691
tried to stop you and
lost her life for it.

38:01.791 --> 38:05.891
And now, Dave, you get to spend
the rest of your life behind bars.

38:05.926 --> 38:07.591
Take him.

38:25.391 --> 38:26.456
What?

38:26.491 --> 38:30.091
It's a little different when you have
to look somebody in the eye, isn't it?

38:30.126 --> 38:31.991
Look, we were just trying
to get the hell out of there.

38:32.026 --> 38:33.791
You knew I was a cop.

38:34.491 --> 38:35.091
Police officer!

38:35.191 --> 38:37.291
Put the gun down now!

38:39.191 --> 38:39.991
do you hear her?

38:40.026 --> 38:41.058
That chick's a cop!

38:41.093 --> 38:42.091
Drive. Just drive.

38:42.191 --> 38:42.991
She I.D.'ed us, man!

38:43.091 --> 38:44.091
We're done.

38:44.191 --> 38:46.291
We gotta take care of this
like we're supposed to.

38:50.191 --> 38:52.291
there was no truck blocking your way.

38:52.391 --> 38:53.591
You made a choice.

38:53.626 --> 38:54.491
It wasn't me.

38:54.591 --> 38:56.156
I didn't want any part of it.

38:56.191 --> 39:00.891
Well, you know, it's too bad for you that
the only person who can confirm that is dead.

39:08.091 --> 39:09.256
you brandished a gun.

39:09.291 --> 39:13.091
That's assault with a deadly
weapon on a police officer.

39:13.126 --> 39:15.991
In the state of Florida,
that's a provocative act.

39:16.091 --> 39:18.141
Mark Dowd is dead as a result.

39:18.176 --> 39:20.191
You know what that makes it?

39:20.226 --> 39:21.691
Murder.

39:22.091 --> 39:24.491
Well, I-I'll give you Keppling.

39:24.526 --> 39:26.591
It's too late for that.

40:10.991 --> 40:12.391
Hi, Beth.

40:13.491 --> 40:14.891
Who are you?

40:14.991 --> 40:16.791
Beth, my name is Horatio Caine.

40:16.826 --> 40:18.691
I'm a police officer.

40:20.891 --> 40:22.956
They said I've been out for a while.

40:22.991 --> 40:28.691
You had A... quite a large dose
of narcotics in your system.

40:30.191 --> 40:32.091
You mean, I could've died?

40:32.191 --> 40:34.091
You're very lucky.

40:35.191 --> 40:41.291
Now, Beth, I hate to do this to you,
but I need to know where you got it.

40:46.791 --> 40:49.191
Beth, I promise I will protect you.

40:49.291 --> 40:51.491
No, it's not like that. It's just...

40:52.791 --> 40:54.491
he's a friend.

40:54.526 --> 40:55.791
Okay.

40:57.091 --> 41:00.991
Beth, so somebody else doesn't get hurt.

41:01.026 --> 41:02.791
I need his name.

41:08.891 --> 41:10.491
Logan.

41:11.891 --> 41:14.191
Logan Sheridan.

41:14.226 --> 41:16.491
Thank you, Beth.

41:16.526 --> 41:18.391
Thank you.

41:24.891 --> 41:26.591
Logan?

41:28.491 --> 41:32.591
My brother, he wasn't selling the drugs.

41:32.626 --> 41:34.691
He was protecting me.

41:40.091 --> 41:42.191
I'm in trouble, aren't I?

41:42.291 --> 41:45.291
This wasn't a good thing, Logan.

41:48.291 --> 41:50.591
I just wanted the shoes.

41:52.591 --> 41:56.791
Logan, Mr. Keppling had no right
to put you in this position.

41:57.691 --> 41:59.591
You arrested him?

42:00.491 --> 42:02.191
Uh, we did.

42:04.091 --> 42:05.891
Is Beth okay?

42:06.391 --> 42:08.191
She will be...

42:09.191 --> 42:10.156
she will be.

42:10.191 --> 42:14.291
I'm gonna need the names
of the other dealers. Okay?

42:16.791 --> 42:18.791
What about me?

42:20.191 --> 42:23.591
Logan, there are going
to be consequences.

42:24.191 --> 42:27.091
But we'll get through it. Okay?
