WEBVTT

00:00.034 --> 00:04.136
ADULT ADAM:<i> Back in the day,</i>
<i> we all had that one crazy,</i>
<i> legendary uncle.</i>

00:04.138 --> 00:06.705
<i> For me, it was my</i>
<i> dad's brother Marvin.</i>

00:06.707 --> 00:07.239
<i> He had a million jobs,</i>

00:07.241 --> 00:10.275
<i> always annoyed my dad</i>
<i> when he came over</i>
<i> to Thanksgiving...</i>

00:10.277 --> 00:10.876
Go away!

00:10.878 --> 00:12.978
<i> ...and could</i>
<i> sweet-talk anyone.</i>

00:12.980 --> 00:14.179
(GASPS)

00:14.181 --> 00:15.814
Oh, my word!

00:15.816 --> 00:18.183
Have I stumbled
into the residence

00:18.185 --> 00:21.153
of workout goddess
Jane Fonda?

00:21.155 --> 00:22.321
Marvin, come on.
(CHUCKLES)

00:22.323 --> 00:23.789
Get in here!
(SQUEALS)

00:23.791 --> 00:25.591
(BOTH LAUGH)
You...

00:25.593 --> 00:29.261
(GASPS)
There they are,
Crockett and Tubbs.

00:29.263 --> 00:32.731
What up, my men?
We have no money!
Please go away.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.600
I'm not here
for your money, Murman.

00:34.602 --> 00:35.934
I'm just dropping by
to see the fam.

00:35.936 --> 00:39.972
He's right, Mur.
Be nice to your brother.
It's Thanksgiving.

00:39.974 --> 00:40.939
It's the middle of May.

00:40.941 --> 00:42.908
Oh. Then, yeah,
he's here for cash.

00:42.910 --> 00:46.445
How dare you suggest
that I am here
for a handout?

00:46.447 --> 00:51.283
Although, as luck
would have it, I am having
a spot of bad luck.

00:51.285 --> 00:53.619
Here we go.
Just hear him out.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.255
Tell us about your recent
failures, Marvin.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.389
Classic tale.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.991
There I was,
minding my own business

00:58.993 --> 01:02.594
in this mystical shop
on the outskirts
of Chinatown,

01:02.596 --> 01:05.030
when, suddenly,
this ancient man popped out

01:05.032 --> 01:09.468
and asked me
if I wanted to buy
this rare and exotic pet.

01:09.470 --> 01:12.071
Ooh. Like a sassy,
colorful bird?

01:12.073 --> 01:13.172
Better. A Mogwai.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.707
And so, naturally,
I handed him $6,000.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.976
Are you nuts?
That's not even
the worst part.

01:17.978 --> 01:21.880
You see,
these Mogwai are
"super-high maintenance."

01:21.882 --> 01:23.182
You can't get them wet,
no bright lights,

01:23.184 --> 01:27.486
and if you feed them
after midnight, they become
these bloodthirsty monsters!

01:27.488 --> 01:29.721
Who would buy a pet
like that? Who?

01:29.723 --> 01:31.523
No one! That's who!
It's from<i> Gremlins.</i>

01:31.525 --> 01:35.861
Murray, please. He had
some trouble in Chinatown.
Just give him some money.

01:35.863 --> 01:38.063
It's on Adam's lunchbox.
It's right here!

01:38.065 --> 01:40.666
How dare you
exploit the fact
that I'm a kid at heart?

01:40.668 --> 01:43.235
This is what
he's talking about!

01:43.504 --> 01:44.670
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:44.672 --> 01:48.740
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

01:51.011 --> 01:52.111
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

01:52.113 --> 01:55.447
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

01:55.449 --> 01:57.449
ADULT ADAM:<i> It was May 10th,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

01:57.451 --> 01:59.718
<i> and my brother</i>
<i> was working hard</i>
<i> to get voted</i>

01:59.720 --> 02:01.787
<i> Best Dancer</i>
<i> in the school yearbook.</i>

02:01.789 --> 02:04.823
Barry Goldberg!
Best Electric Boogaloo!

02:04.825 --> 02:07.726
ADULT ADAM:<i> But to be honest,</i>
<i> he'd take best anything.</i>

02:07.728 --> 02:10.095
I'm doing business
on my phone!

02:10.097 --> 02:13.699
Vote Barry Goldberg
Most Likely To Succeed!

02:13.701 --> 02:16.969
Barry Goldberg
Most Likely To Do This.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.271
Barry Goldberg,
Best Juggler.

02:19.273 --> 02:22.574
ADULT ADAM:<i> After two weeks</i>
<i> of campaigning,</i>
<i> he got desperate.</i>

02:22.576 --> 02:25.144
Ow! Hey! What the...
Why is this happening?

02:25.146 --> 02:29.314
Just get in the locker!
Vote for Barry Goldberg!
Best Bully!

02:29.316 --> 02:30.816
(CHUCKLES)
I won't let you down.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.017
ADAM: Dude,
you're hurting my body!

02:32.019 --> 02:33.519
Damn it.
Why won't you fit?

02:33.521 --> 02:33.952
(GRUNTS)
Wha...

02:33.954 --> 02:37.723
'Cause I'm not
a child anymore!
I'm a grown person!

02:37.725 --> 02:38.423
How do you not
see it by now?

02:38.425 --> 02:42.628
For your information,
Best Bully isn't something
in the yearbook.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.428
How would you know?

02:43.430 --> 02:45.631
You're just one of Adam's
dumb little friends.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.099
Actually,
I'm the editor.

02:47.101 --> 02:47.766
No way! So what'd I get?

02:47.768 --> 02:52.538
Let's just say you weren't
recognized for any
individual achievement.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.306
Damn it!
I gotta be something!

02:54.308 --> 02:57.342
(IN SING-SONG VOICE)
Guess who got
Best Substitute Teacher?

02:57.344 --> 02:59.311
The guy with the bat
from<i> Lean on Me?</i>

02:59.313 --> 03:01.213
It's your mom, dude.
Enjoy your day.

03:01.215 --> 03:02.614
(BEVERLY CHUCKLES)
Bye, Adam.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.483
Later, babe.
Later.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.518
The yearbook
must be stopped.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.687
Not being recognized
for my awesomeness

03:08.689 --> 03:11.790
is the greatest injustice
this world has ever seen.

03:11.792 --> 03:12.724
You should get
kindest eyes.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.027
And you should get
Rightest Guy
'cause you're right!

03:15.029 --> 03:16.895
That's not
an equal compliment,
but I'll take it.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.730
Okay, I probably shouldn't
be saying this out loud,

03:18.732 --> 03:21.967
but the only thing I want
in the world is to get
Cutest Couple with Erica.

03:21.969 --> 03:24.770
Geoff, it's just
a lame yearbook.
Who cares?

03:24.772 --> 03:26.538
Especially
'cause we're a lock,
so why obsess over it?

03:26.540 --> 03:30.042
A lock? Come on.
There's way better,
cuter couples out there.

03:30.044 --> 03:32.010
Like who?
Hello? Me and Barry?

03:32.012 --> 03:34.046
Mmm-hmm.
Aw! You'd totally win.

03:34.048 --> 03:37.649
Except half your couple
is Barry, so... (VOCALIZES)

03:37.651 --> 03:38.150
Hate to be this guy,

03:38.152 --> 03:41.220
but I think everyone's
kinda over the whole
Erica and Geoff thing.

03:41.222 --> 03:44.122
Yeah, Barry and Lainey may
not be the fresh new couple,

03:44.124 --> 03:45.958
but you can't help
but root for them.

03:45.960 --> 03:46.658
Ha!
Oh, no! They're right!

03:46.660 --> 03:49.928
Damn it, I need this win!
I gotta find out
who they picked!

03:49.930 --> 03:52.030
Just go ask Adam.
'Cause he's on
the yearbook staff.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.899
Since when?
Since he started
dating the editor.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.401
You mean Dana?
You should really get
to know your brother.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.170
You mean punch him
until we get
what we want, right?

03:58.172 --> 04:00.172
ADULT ADAM:
<i> While Erica and Barry</i>
<i> suddenly needed me,</i>

04:00.174 --> 04:04.476
<i> my mom realized my uncle</i>
<i> was in dire need</i>
<i> of a lifeline.</i>

04:04.478 --> 04:05.711
God!
BEVERLY: Marvin, wait.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.279
I can't let you leave
empty handed.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.514
I made you three casseroles
and a Jell-O ring.

04:09.516 --> 04:11.483
(CHUCKLES)
You're always
so good to me.

04:11.485 --> 04:14.253
Marvin.
Are you okay?

04:14.255 --> 04:16.388
All right, here's
the cold hard truth.

04:16.390 --> 04:19.157
You know all that stuff
I was saying
about the Mogwais?

04:19.159 --> 04:22.427
It's not real.
It's from this movie
<i> Gremlins.</i>

04:22.429 --> 04:26.031
It's made by Steven Spielberg.
It's got all these
little muppets in it.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.567
It's surprisingly scary.
Everybody knows the movie.

04:28.569 --> 04:31.536
Starring Phoebe Cates.
Woof, is she my type.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.171
Please, let me help you.

04:33.173 --> 04:36.141
Okay, here's the deal.
I gambled away
a lot of money

04:36.143 --> 04:37.376
in Atlantic City
playing keno.

04:37.378 --> 04:41.079
Keno? What are you,
75 years old?
Nobody plays that!

04:41.081 --> 04:43.348
That's why I thought
I had an edge! Damn it!

04:43.350 --> 04:45.717
You know, instead of coming
to Murray asking for money,

04:45.719 --> 04:48.553
why don't you
ask him for a job
at the furniture store?

04:48.555 --> 04:51.490
Oh, man,
if you get me this job,

04:51.492 --> 04:54.593
I will never ask you
for anything again.

04:54.595 --> 04:55.360
If you're serious,

04:55.362 --> 04:58.096
I will do everything
in my power
to get you a job.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.232
Absolutely not!
The answer is no.

05:00.234 --> 05:04.102
You don't have
to convince anyone, Marvin.
The job's all yours.

05:04.104 --> 05:07.072
Look, Barry already
worked here,
and it was a disaster.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.574
I'm not hiring another child
from this family.

05:09.576 --> 05:13.211
Pfft. If I'm a child,
then why was I sentenced
as an adult

05:13.213 --> 05:14.012
when I borrowed
that police horse?

05:14.014 --> 05:18.550
Well, I'm still a partner,
and I can hire and fire
whoever I want.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.519
Marvin, you're hired.
Yes!

05:20.521 --> 05:23.021
And I can do this.
You're fired.
No!

05:23.023 --> 05:24.589
You're hired again.
Boom!

05:24.591 --> 05:25.757
You're fired.
Frickin' Reaganomics!

05:25.759 --> 05:28.860
You're hired back.
I promise I won't
let you down this time, boss.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.395
I'm gonna give it my all.
You're fired.

05:30.397 --> 05:32.431
(BLEEP)
You're hired again.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.432
Yes!
You're fired.

05:33.434 --> 05:36.401
No!
And you're hired again,
end of story.

05:36.403 --> 05:40.772
Well, that was
a roller-coaster ride.
Glad it worked out.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.507
It's settled. Good.
Bye.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.876
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And with that, my dad</i>
<i> had his newest employee.</i>

05:44.878 --> 05:50.349
<i> Meanwhile, my older siblings</i>
<i> came to me for a little</i>
<i> polite conversation.</i>

05:50.351 --> 05:52.651
Hey! That was my record!
Seven!

05:52.653 --> 05:53.819
Okay, it was six.
What do you want?

05:53.821 --> 05:56.855
I need you to change
the yearbook
so I get Most Handsome

05:56.857 --> 06:00.158
or Most Likely To Jump A BMX
Over The Grand Canyon!

06:00.160 --> 06:03.195
No.
But what about telling
your gentle, loving sister

06:03.197 --> 06:04.863
who's always adored you,
what she got?

06:04.865 --> 06:05.664
Yeah, I'm not gonna do
any of that.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.799
Hold him down and I'll
beat him with his own toys!
Go ahead!

06:07.801 --> 06:12.003
Nothing you can do
will hurt as much as betraying
my fellow yearbook staff!

06:12.005 --> 06:13.772
I don't care about
your dumb baby club!

06:13.774 --> 06:16.475
This is a very serious
real, adult problem!

06:16.477 --> 06:19.344
Now tell me if Geoff and I
got Raddest Couple!
How about this?

06:19.346 --> 06:24.750
I tell you nothing
and you put some Magic Shell
on some ice cream for me.

06:24.752 --> 06:27.285
(SIGHS)
Why is he making
delicious demands

06:27.287 --> 06:28.320
instead of cowering
in fear?

06:28.322 --> 06:32.090
'Cause for the
first time ever,
I have absolute power.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.693
I not only know
what's in the yearbook,

06:34.695 --> 06:36.495
but I can rewrite it
as I please.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.830
You're bluffing.
He's bluffing.
Maybe I am.

06:38.832 --> 06:43.735
Or maybe I make you
Most Likely To Share An
Apartment With Her Mother.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.037
That's my nightmare!
Or is it your destiny?

06:46.039 --> 06:46.538
No!
Make him stop.

06:46.540 --> 06:50.542
I'm just getting started,
Most Likely To Lose
A Freestyle Rap Competition.

06:50.544 --> 06:54.546
Don't you dare put that in.
You got it,
Worst Dirt Biker.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.481
No!
Slowest Nunchucker.

06:56.483 --> 06:58.583
He's attacking
my private insecurities!

06:58.585 --> 07:00.485
I have extensive demands.
If you meet them,

07:00.487 --> 07:03.889
I might be inclined to let you
sneak a peek at the yearbook.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.757
ERICA: Clean your room?
Do your homework?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.559
Buy you scratch 'n sniff
stickers?

07:07.561 --> 07:08.627
ADAM: I wrote the list
four years ago.

07:08.629 --> 07:12.264
I've waited my whole life
for this moment
and it's finally here.

07:12.266 --> 07:16.234
I'm no longer
your nerdy little brother.
I'm your equal.

07:16.236 --> 07:19.337
Just let me kick him!
Control your feet, Barry.

07:19.339 --> 07:19.805
He owns us.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.174
Barry, do me a favor
and scratch this for me?

07:22.176 --> 07:23.375
My finger grows weary.
Never!

07:23.377 --> 07:28.246
Suit yourself,
Most Likely To Never Dunk
On A Regulation Basket.

07:31.251 --> 07:31.683
(SNIFFS DEEPLY)

07:31.685 --> 07:33.351
ADULT ADAM:<i> As I savored</i>
<i> the sweet smell of revenge,</i>

07:33.353 --> 07:36.354
<i> my uncle was hungry to begin</i>
<i> peddling ugly '80s furniture.</i>

07:36.356 --> 07:40.225
(LAUGHS) Don't sweat it, Mur.
I give you my word
I won't let you down.

07:40.227 --> 07:43.195
I literally have never
been able to count on you.

07:43.197 --> 07:46.431
So I'm due!
You have never
come through for me ever.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.800
All you have to do
is teach me
everything you know,

07:48.802 --> 07:51.203
starting now.
Like, what's this called?

07:51.205 --> 07:52.571
Lamp.
Lamp! Got it!

07:52.573 --> 07:54.873
All right. Keep 'em coming.
What's this thing here?

07:54.875 --> 07:55.707
Couch.
Ooh! How about this?

07:55.709 --> 07:58.410
Coffee table.
Ooh!
What's this jammy here?

07:58.412 --> 07:59.311
Couch.
What's this?

07:59.313 --> 08:00.812
Table.
What's this thing named?

08:00.814 --> 08:01.980
Chair again.
Ooh! What's this?

08:01.982 --> 08:04.282
Couch.
Any details
you want to share?

08:04.284 --> 08:05.283
Couch!
Done!

08:05.285 --> 08:08.787
I know what you know now!
We are now equals!

08:08.789 --> 08:09.321
Let the sales begin!

08:09.323 --> 08:12.624
ADULT ADAM:<i> And so Marvin</i>
<i> was off to prove himself,</i>
<i> no questions asked.</i>

08:12.626 --> 08:16.094
Is this a clock-in,
clock-out situation,
or am I on salary?

08:16.096 --> 08:17.963
Doesn't matter!
I'm in it to win it!

08:17.965 --> 08:19.464
Let's sell some
extra-size chairs!

08:19.466 --> 08:21.733
Couch!
Why is that not sticking?

08:21.735 --> 08:24.903
ADULT ADAM:<i> Okay, yeah,</i>
<i> this wasn't gonna go well.</i>

08:25.572 --> 08:27.906
ADULT ADAM:<i> Desperate</i>
<i> to find out what they'd be</i>
<i> voted in the yearbook,</i>

08:27.908 --> 08:32.244
<i> Erica and Barry had no choice</i>
<i> but to give in to my list</i>
<i> of ridiculous demands.</i>

08:32.246 --> 08:35.313
Okay, they were out
of grape scratch 'n sniff
stickers,

08:35.315 --> 08:38.149
so I got hamburger,
pizza, and skunk.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.018
Skunk?
Use your head, man!

08:40.020 --> 08:43.455
That's the one scratch
no one wants to sniff!
(SNIFFS)

08:43.457 --> 08:44.322
Oh, no!

08:44.324 --> 08:47.592
Do you think Jedi Master
Adam Skywalker
will be displeased?

08:47.594 --> 08:49.794
He's not here, you don't
have to call him that!

08:49.796 --> 08:50.529
I got to get in the habit.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.931
If I screw up, who knows
what he'll label me
in the yearbook?

08:52.933 --> 08:56.501
This is crazy!
We're scared of Adam!
He's like, a tiny boy.

08:56.503 --> 08:59.304
He's been on the computer
all day proofreading
the yearbook.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.806
Let's just go in
and swipe the stupid
floppy disk.

09:01.808 --> 09:02.741
Oh, no.
Stop panicking.

09:02.743 --> 09:06.711
We gotta think of a
brilliant, complex plan
to lure him away from it.

09:06.713 --> 09:10.315
ADULT ADAM:<i> And lure me</i>
<i> she did, using</i>
<i> my one great weakness.</i>

09:10.317 --> 09:10.749
Yo, Jedi Master?

09:10.751 --> 09:15.787
Number three on your list
is to inform you of any
pertinent TV marathons,

09:15.789 --> 09:17.656
and there's a whole
block of<i> ALF</i> on.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.191
Yes!
It's show time, buddy!

09:20.193 --> 09:22.527
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Okay, so their plan</i>
<i> wasn't so much clever</i>

09:22.529 --> 09:24.429
<i> and complex as it was</i>
<i> sad and easy.</i>

09:24.431 --> 09:27.866
Here we go. Okay.
Let's see what we get.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.869
Son of a bitch!
It's Anthony Balsamo
and Lexy Bloom?

09:30.871 --> 09:33.505
They gave it to the
head cheerleader and our
handsome quarterback!

09:33.507 --> 09:34.940
What kind of backwards school
do we go to?

09:34.942 --> 09:37.542
Screw that.
I'm changing Cutest Couple
to me and whatshisface.

09:37.544 --> 09:40.078
It's a weird time
to forget my name,
but do it for us, baby.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.080
No way!
This is my shining moment!

09:42.082 --> 09:43.248
Stop it!
Stop it!

09:43.250 --> 09:44.516
You stop it!
You stop it!

09:44.518 --> 09:45.784
Stop it!
Lainey, stop it!

09:45.786 --> 09:47.485
Stop!
Stop! Knock it off!

09:47.487 --> 09:49.621
Lai... Stop it!
BARRY: Stop fighting!

09:49.623 --> 09:50.088
Everyone, come on!

09:50.090 --> 09:52.424
I want Barry
and Lainey Best Couple!
(INDISTINCT ARGUING)

09:52.426 --> 09:53.625
Are you kidding me?

09:53.627 --> 09:55.026
(GASPS)
It's Jedi Master Adam!

09:55.028 --> 09:58.830
How dare you use
<i> ALF's</i> good name
to distract me?

09:58.832 --> 09:59.397
<i> ALF</i> is sacred!

09:59.399 --> 10:03.435
He eats cats, dude.
Cats are the chicken
of Melmac!

10:03.704 --> 10:05.971
Doesn't matter!
Give me my disk!

10:05.973 --> 10:06.905
You left us
no choice, man.

10:06.907 --> 10:10.008
We've been working our fingers
to the bone to make you happy!

10:10.010 --> 10:11.443
Just let me make
one little change.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.044
Never!
Give us that floppy!

10:13.046 --> 10:14.346
We need it! Hand it over!

10:14.348 --> 10:15.947
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And then it happened.</i>

10:15.949 --> 10:16.481
(IN SLOW-MOTION)
No!

10:16.483 --> 10:19.050
<i> Barry accidentally grazed</i>
<i> the inside of the disk.</i>

10:19.052 --> 10:24.255
<i> Yep, back then,</i>
<i> a fragile floppy could be</i>
<i> ruined with one tiny touch.</i>

10:24.257 --> 10:26.625
Oh, no. You touched
the tender insides!

10:26.627 --> 10:28.893
No. I didn't. My fingers
missed the tender insides.

10:28.895 --> 10:32.130
I saw it. Your meaty thumb
was all over
the tender insides!

10:32.132 --> 10:35.634
My fingers missed
the tender insides!
Let's relax!

10:35.636 --> 10:38.570
The tender insides
are still gonna be okay.
(CLEARS THROAT)

10:38.572 --> 10:40.939
ADULT ADAM:<i> It was</i>
<i> the most tense moment</i>
<i> of my life.</i>

10:40.941 --> 10:44.609
<i> Surely, a fingerprint</i>

10:44.611 --> 10:45.977
<i> And yet, it did.</i>

10:45.979 --> 10:47.145
He touched
the tender insides.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.247
I didn't think
I touched it.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.249
So, now that we're
starting fresh,

10:51.251 --> 10:54.753
may I suggest
Geoff and Erica
for cutest couple?

10:54.755 --> 10:55.687
(BARRY SIGHS)
Too soon?

10:55.689 --> 10:57.222
ADULT ADAM:<i> While I lost</i>
<i> the entire school year,</i>

10:57.224 --> 11:01.326
<i> my uncle discovered</i>
<i> a cushy way</i>
<i> to make us millions.</i>

11:01.328 --> 11:02.227
What the hell is this?

11:02.229 --> 11:06.264
This, my dear brother,
is our future.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.000
I give you... Bean bags.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.201
I don't want
any bean bags!

11:10.203 --> 11:12.237
Take them back to
where they come from.

11:12.239 --> 11:12.837
Please, just hear me out.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.640
Do you remember last year
when I went back
to college for a week?

11:15.642 --> 11:17.242
Yeah, I paid for
the whole semester.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.277
Well, before I was
unfairly kicked out

11:19.279 --> 11:20.879
of the freshman dorm
for that fire,

11:20.881 --> 11:23.782
I learned that every kid
comes with two things...

11:23.784 --> 11:26.051
A mini-fridge
and bean bag chairs.

11:26.053 --> 11:29.254
Marvin! This isn't
a get-rich-quick scheme.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.689
We sell furniture!

11:30.691 --> 11:33.425
Um, bean bag chairs
are furniture.

11:33.427 --> 11:35.760
They're soft, colorful balls
of furniture.

11:35.762 --> 11:36.494
How are you
not getting this?

11:36.496 --> 11:39.764
Damn it, Marvin!
No person wants to sit
on a sack of beans.

11:39.766 --> 11:41.866
Yes, they will! Just pull up
a bag and sit on it!

11:41.868 --> 11:43.101
I will never sit
on a bag of beans.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.236
Sit on the beans.
I don't want to sit
on the beans!

11:45.238 --> 11:46.304
No! Come on!
Try it!

11:46.306 --> 11:47.205
Stop it!
I don't want to try it!

11:47.207 --> 11:50.475
Ease on down
to comfy town.
I don't want to! I just don't!

11:50.477 --> 11:51.476
(GRUNTS)
Yes.

11:51.478 --> 11:54.312
Now let the tiny beans
work their magic.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.380
Damn it! I'm stuck!

11:55.382 --> 11:56.748
The more I push,
the more I sink!

11:56.750 --> 11:59.150
(CHUCKLES)
You're doing it wrong.
You got to shimmy out.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.252
Like me. Watch.
I am shimmying!

12:01.254 --> 12:03.922
(STRAINING) You just
got to do like I do.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.223
(SCREAMS)

12:05.225 --> 12:08.259
Now I'm stuck in this
horrible cloud of beans!

12:08.261 --> 12:10.261
I knew this was
a bad idea!
Help me!

12:10.263 --> 12:12.931
You were supposed to
take this seriously!

12:12.933 --> 12:13.198
I do!

12:13.200 --> 12:15.266
But if you don't
appreciate me,
then I'm gonna quit.

12:15.268 --> 12:18.169
More like you're fired!
Let me show you the door!

12:18.171 --> 12:21.206
Yeah, don't bother.
I'll go through it myself.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.208
(GRUNTING WILDLY)

12:24.244 --> 12:25.410
Seriously?

12:25.412 --> 12:27.579
The whole yearbook's gone?
How did this happen?

12:27.581 --> 12:30.548
Well, as you know,
these two treat me
like a child,

12:30.550 --> 12:32.550
so I composed
a list of demands

12:32.552 --> 12:34.786
for when the balance of power
shifted in my favor.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.488
What are you
even talking about?

12:36.490 --> 12:37.822
Do you have any idea
how much time

12:37.824 --> 12:39.224
I've spent working
on this layout?

12:39.226 --> 12:41.092
Based on the fact that
this is the yearbook,

12:41.094 --> 12:42.560
I'm gonna go with
a year?

12:42.562 --> 12:44.262
Yes.
And now it's all gone.

12:44.264 --> 12:44.896
Don't worry, Dana.

12:44.898 --> 12:48.733
I've literally memorized
the entire school year.

12:48.735 --> 12:51.202
All I got to do
is re-create the yearbook

12:51.204 --> 12:52.470
using my brain snapshots.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.672
You mean your memories?
Accessing first day of school.

12:54.674 --> 12:57.342
(INHALES DEEPLY)
It was late September,
Wednesday.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.677
It was snowing hard,
and the Eagles
were in the Super Bowl.

12:59.679 --> 13:03.548
None of that's right.
Geoff Schwartz was there,
and he said something funny.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.849
And we were like,
"Good one, bro."

13:04.851 --> 13:07.285
That does sound like me.
Just forget about it.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.253
I still have the hard copy,

13:08.255 --> 13:10.221
so I'll just retype
the whole thing by myself.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.691
At least let me help.
No. Trust me.
You've done enough.

13:13.693 --> 13:14.993
You think
this was my fault?

13:14.995 --> 13:16.427
They told me
<i> ALF</i> was on.

13:16.429 --> 13:19.964
I mean, puppetry, comedy,
a wisecracking alien.

13:19.966 --> 13:20.598
Come on!
I'm just a man.

13:20.600 --> 13:25.136
No. No, you're really not.
You're actually just a child.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.739
Thanks a lot!
You ruined my life.

13:27.741 --> 13:30.742
You started this
when you gave us
that insane list of demands.

13:30.744 --> 13:31.709
Do you even know
why I wrote it?

13:31.711 --> 13:35.146
My whole life,
you've treated me like some
insignificant baby!

13:35.148 --> 13:38.683
I couldn't wait
till I got to high school
so I could be an equal.

13:38.685 --> 13:41.386
But it got worse!
You respect me less!

13:41.388 --> 13:41.786
Adam.
No!

13:41.788 --> 13:44.722
It's bad enough
that you always see me
as a little child,

13:44.724 --> 13:46.591
but now Jackie does, too.

13:46.593 --> 13:47.592
I hope you're happy.

13:47.594 --> 13:50.461
Jedi Master Adam's
done with you two!

13:53.834 --> 13:54.799
Huh?

13:54.801 --> 13:56.134
(LAUGHING)
Oh, hey! Ho!

13:56.136 --> 13:57.068
Bev! How's it going?

13:57.070 --> 13:59.838
I was just... (CLEARS THROAT)
poppin' into the Wawa here

13:59.840 --> 14:01.573
to pick up some
strawberry milk and...

14:01.575 --> 14:04.075
And get a box
of California raisins.

14:04.077 --> 14:04.809
You gotta
treat the body good

14:04.811 --> 14:07.178
if you want it
to treat you good back.
You know what I'm saying?

14:07.180 --> 14:09.848
Are you just saying a bunch
of words to distract me

14:09.850 --> 14:11.683
from the fact that
you're living in your car?

14:11.685 --> 14:14.652
Can't a man just have all
of his worldly possessions

14:14.654 --> 14:16.321
stuffed into
his DeLorean?

14:16.323 --> 14:17.922
What happened
to your condo?

14:17.924 --> 14:19.390
Funny story, sad story.

14:19.392 --> 14:22.026
I had to sell it in order
to get rid of my keno debt,

14:22.028 --> 14:26.798
which is a good thing because
now I'm free and clear
to start over fresh.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.900
Fresh?
You're homeless.

14:28.902 --> 14:32.904
I like to think of it not as
home-less but as car-full.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.874
I'm actually thrilled
this is happening,
except for the bucket.

14:35.876 --> 14:36.808
Don't look in the bucket.

14:36.810 --> 14:37.909
Okay, you're coming home
with me.

14:37.911 --> 14:40.445
You can stay in the basement
until you get back
on your feet.

14:40.447 --> 14:44.616
Yeah, I don't know
if the Mur-Man's
gonna be cool with that.

14:44.618 --> 14:47.719
Marvin,
he loves you dearly.

14:47.721 --> 14:48.653
He may act all angry,

14:48.655 --> 14:51.789
but deep in his heart,
he wants you to live with us.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.591
I do not want him
living with us!

14:53.593 --> 14:56.728
I am saying it out loud
so everyone can hear!

14:56.730 --> 14:58.129
He's got to go!
No Marvin!

14:58.131 --> 14:58.830
Think you're right, Bev.

14:58.832 --> 15:01.699
He's playing it super angry,
but he wants this.

15:01.701 --> 15:04.002
Ha-ha! I knew
this would happen!
I called it.

15:04.004 --> 15:08.773
Now I got four kids
living here forever
and leeching off me.

15:08.775 --> 15:09.474
That's it!

15:09.476 --> 15:13.778
I am tired of you
always calling me
your idiot kid brother!

15:13.780 --> 15:15.647
Just once,
I want you to treat me

15:15.649 --> 15:17.582
like Barry and Erica
treat Adam,

15:17.584 --> 15:19.284
with a little bit
of dignity and respect!

15:19.286 --> 15:22.086
The timing of this comparison
is not good.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.188
That's why I'm a damaged
shell of a man, Murray,

15:24.190 --> 15:27.225
because you never looked
at me like I was your equal,

15:27.227 --> 15:28.526
unlike these two angels

15:28.528 --> 15:30.929
who build up their kid brother
no matter what!

15:30.931 --> 15:33.631
Oh, my God.
Adam's gonna be Marvin.

15:33.633 --> 15:34.899
We got to fix this.

15:34.901 --> 15:35.600
You see that?

15:35.602 --> 15:40.872
There they go,
off to make a growing
boy's dreams come true.

15:40.874 --> 15:42.573
Learn from them.
Don't do that.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.909
Don't make me out
to be the bad guy here.

15:44.911 --> 15:47.812
Right.
'Cause that's always me.

15:47.814 --> 15:50.448
Good news, Murray...
You never have to worry

15:50.450 --> 15:53.184
about another kid staying
in your house ever again.

Uh, I don't want to sound
ungrateful here, Bevvy,

16:10.270 --> 16:13.604
but you got to
put your back into it!

16:23.917 --> 16:25.783
Not boy. Man.
Full man.

16:25.785 --> 16:28.486
I don't know what's happening,
but make it stop.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.020
Look, you were right.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.322
It's not fair
that we still treat you
like a dumb little kid.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.891
From now on, you're no longer
our nerdy baby bro.

16:33.893 --> 16:36.060
You're like a real person
that matters.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.695
Well, none of that helps me
get Jackie back.

16:37.697 --> 16:42.200
Lucky for you,
we can help with that by
doing what we do best...

16:42.202 --> 16:45.303
redeeming relationships
with original song.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.838
(FINGERS SNAP)
Hit it!

16:47.807 --> 16:50.274
<i> ¶ Dear Jackie,</i>
<i> I really miss ya, girl</i>

16:50.276 --> 16:52.910
<i> ¶ It's me, Adam</i>
<i> the nerdiest nerd</i>
<i> in the world</i>

16:52.912 --> 16:55.713
<i> ¶ Yeah, I once was a boy</i>
<i> who liked robots and space</i>

16:55.715 --> 16:58.383
<i> ¶ But now I'm a man who</i>
<i> likes smoochin' your face</i>

16:58.385 --> 17:01.052
<i> ¶ Anyway, Jackie,</i>
<i> I'm so, so sorry</i>

17:01.054 --> 17:04.355
<i> ¶ Now come to my basement</i>
<i> and let's play Atari</i>

17:04.357 --> 17:07.392
<i> ¶ Girl, I must confess</i>

17:07.394 --> 17:08.960
<i> ¶ Ah, yeah</i>

17:08.962 --> 17:12.363
<i> ¶ I'm in complete distress</i>

17:12.365 --> 17:14.065
<i> ¶ My heart's in two, girl</i>

17:14.067 --> 17:17.435
<i> ¶ About this yearbook mess</i>

17:17.437 --> 17:18.403
(WHISPERS) Forgive me.

17:18.405 --> 17:23.207
<i> ¶ He's a man, he's a man,</i>
<i> he's a man</i>

17:23.209 --> 17:25.376
<i> ¶ Adam is the man ¶</i>

17:25.378 --> 17:28.679
Sorry about ruining
your life's work.

17:29.182 --> 17:33.151
I got to say, that was
pretty well-rehearsed
for how bad it was.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.554
Was it the chorus?
I told them it sucked!

17:36.556 --> 17:37.588
Forget the song.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.324
Fact is, if I want to be
treated like an adult,

17:40.326 --> 17:41.359
I got to act like one.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.628
And that means taking
real responsibility.

17:43.630 --> 17:47.432
Oh, look. Our baby brother
is a baby man now.

17:47.434 --> 17:48.966
What can we do to help?

17:49.169 --> 17:51.602
How are your
typing skills?

17:52.539 --> 17:54.238
Done!
What's this?

17:54.240 --> 17:57.842
The yearbook...
Every page, every caption.
It's all there.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.043
How is that even possible?

17:59.045 --> 18:01.446
First, I got my brother
and sister to help.

18:01.448 --> 18:02.980
Then we got
all our closest friends

18:02.982 --> 18:05.116
to retype it
page by page.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.018
You did that for me?
I did.

18:07.020 --> 18:09.821
And then I read it,
and it was a giant mess.

18:09.823 --> 18:12.990
So I took the disk that we
destroyed to a computer expert

18:12.992 --> 18:14.559
and spent
all my Bar Mitzvah money

18:14.561 --> 18:17.528
to fix the tender insides
of the floppy.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.797
Gotta say, I'm impressed.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.200
I did make one change,
though.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.102
I made us
Cutest Couple.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.504
That's a blatant
abuse of power.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.972
And I'm good with it.

ADULT ADAM:<i> In the end,</i>
<i> I learned the easiest way</i>

18:30.009 --> 18:32.910
<i> to be treated like a grown-up</i>
<i> was to act like one.</i>

18:32.912 --> 18:36.080
<i> And my dad realized that,</i>
<i> despite everything,</i>

18:36.082 --> 18:39.684
<i> his little brother</i>
<i> had actually come a long way.</i>

18:39.686 --> 18:41.986
<i> ¶ Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh</i>

18:41.988 --> 18:43.087
Hey.

18:43.089 --> 18:43.888
<i> ¶ Ooh-ooh</i>

18:43.890 --> 18:47.592
Go away. I'm about to
sit down to dinner.

18:48.061 --> 18:49.627
Here's a key.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.596
What's that?

18:52.298 --> 18:53.831
You're moving in.

18:53.833 --> 18:57.335
Well, I thought you didn't
want another kid
leeching off of you.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.504
You're not a kid.
You're my brother.

18:59.506 --> 19:02.807
And you won't be leeching,
'cause you're paying rent.

19:02.809 --> 19:03.808
How? I don't have a job.

19:03.810 --> 19:07.044
Yeah, you do.
At the store with me.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.479
Why? Why would you do that?

19:08.481 --> 19:11.282
It's time we both
started believing in you.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.049
<i> ¶ Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh</i>

19:12.051 --> 19:14.685
(VOICE BREAKING)
I just messed up everything.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.454
Maybe you did.

19:16.456 --> 19:20.291
But it's never too late
to start over.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.894
Really?
Together.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.829
Thanks, Mur.

ADAM: "I'm the Leia
to your Han Solo."

19:33.273 --> 19:34.505
Oh, sweet God.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.040
Don't get a big head
about it.

19:36.042 --> 19:37.241
No, read what I wrote.

19:37.243 --> 19:39.343
"I'm the Han Solo
to your Leia."

19:39.345 --> 19:41.779
That's crazy, right?
It's crazy.

19:41.781 --> 19:42.346
(BOTH LAUGH)

19:42.348 --> 19:46.184
Would you look at that?
Our little man's
all grown up.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.885
Gross. But cute.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.221
We're kissing now.
It's happening.
Uh, like now now?

19:53.693 --> 19:56.060
<i> that year,</i>
<i> my brother and sister</i>

19:56.062 --> 19:57.662
<i> started to see me</i>

19:57.664 --> 20:01.365
<i> And even though the last</i>

<i> was another kid in the house,</i>

20:25.191 --> 20:27.124
Hey, Ad-Rock!
Good news.

20:27.126 --> 20:29.760
I wrote another verse to help
you get back with Jackie.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.696
Dude, everything's
fine with us now.

20:31.698 --> 20:32.330
Please don't sing for me.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.198
Just let it happen,
or he'll never
leave you alone.

<i> ¶ Dear Jackie,</i>
<i> I love you like no other</i>

20:36.836 --> 20:38.536
<i> ¶ But you know</i>

20:38.538 --> 20:39.070
<i> ¶ Barry, my brother</i>

20:39.072 --> 20:41.539
<i> ¶ Black belt in karate,</i>

20:41.541 --> 20:44.275
<i> ¶ It's like how much</i>
<i> can you fit in one body?</i>

20:44.277 --> 20:46.644
<i> ¶ He's a god on Earth,</i>

20:46.646 --> 20:49.380
<i> ¶ To be Barry is divine,</i>
<i> my words, not his</i>

20:49.382 --> 20:51.983
