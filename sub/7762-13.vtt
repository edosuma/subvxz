- THEY SAY THAT CHANGE
IS GOOD FOR YOU,

01:10.771 --> 01:13.574
THAT IT KEEPS YOU
ON YOUR TOES.

01:13.607 --> 01:17.745
WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE,
I SHOULD BE A FUCKING BALLERINA.

01:17.778 --> 01:21.482
WHO'D HAVE BELIEVED THAT BABYLON
WOULD BE A BOMBED-OUT MEMORY?

01:21.515 --> 01:26.654
OR THAT MEL AND LINZ
WOULD BE MOVING TO CANADA?

01:26.687 --> 01:31.759
OR THAT TED WOULD
AT LAST FIND TRUE LOVE?

01:31.792 --> 01:33.794
OR THAT--
[chuckles]

01:33.827 --> 01:37.198
I CAN BARELY EVEN SAY IT,
BUT I'LL TRY.

01:37.231 --> 01:41.735
THAT MR. BRIAN KINNEY
WOULD ASK MR. JUSTIN TAYLOR

01:41.769 --> 01:44.472
FOR HIS HAND IN MARRIAGE?

01:44.505 --> 01:48.476
HOLY SHIT!

01:48.509 --> 01:50.611
- HOLY SHIT.

01:50.644 --> 01:55.349

- YOU LOOK--
[clears throat]

- GOOD?

02:01.522 --> 02:03.557
BAD?

02:03.591 --> 02:06.494
LAUGHABLE?

02:06.527 --> 02:08.362
- [sighs]

02:08.396 --> 02:11.232
BEAUTIFUL.

02:11.265 --> 02:14.468
- I DO?

02:21.542 --> 02:24.245
- IT'S NOT A QUESTION.

02:24.278 --> 02:28.782
IT'S A DECLARATION.

02:28.816 --> 02:32.520
SO TRY AND BE MORE EMPHATIC
WHEN THE MINISTER ASKS YOU

02:32.553 --> 02:37.358
IF YOU WANT
TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

02:39.427 --> 02:42.930

OVER AT OUR HOUSE,

02:49.737 --> 02:51.605
THINGS WERE PRETTY MUCH
THE SAME,

02:51.639 --> 02:52.940
WHICH, AFTER NEARLY
GETTING BLOWN UP,

02:52.973 --> 02:54.408
WAS FINE BY ME.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.810
- OKAY, THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN GREEK,

02:56.844 --> 02:59.547
ELIZABETHAN,
AND MODERN TRAGEDY.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.814

- HUSH!
[phone rings]

03:02.716 --> 03:04.818

03:06.754 --> 03:08.856
- HELLO?
- HOW'S HE DOING?

03:08.889 --> 03:10.591
- OH, HE'S GOT A LOT
OF CATCHING UP TO DO,

03:10.624 --> 03:12.960
BUT I'M HOPEFUL.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.828

03:49.630 --> 03:51.532
- THAT WAS THE COMMITTEE
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.000
- OH, I HOPE YOU TOLD THEM
WE ALREADY GAVE.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.002
- I DID, BUT THEY
DIDN'T WANT MONEY.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.505
- THEN WHAT'D THEY WANT?

03:57.538 --> 03:59.873
- ME.

EXTRACTED?

NO, DON'T TELL ME.

04:25.566 --> 04:26.534
YOU'VE BECOME A NUN
AND YOU'VE TAKEN

04:26.567 --> 04:27.935
AN OATH OF SILENCE.

04:27.968 --> 04:31.772
- YEAH, I'M SISTER
MARY GO-FUCK-YOURSELF.

YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T SEEN
OR HEARD FROM YOU IN DAYS,

EXCEPT FOR AN E-MAIL CANCELLING
YOUR BIRTHDAY DINNER.

WHISKING ME OFF TO MOUNT FLAME

FOR GAY SKI WEEK,
JUST THE TWO OF US.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.783
ISN'T THAT ADORABLE?
- PRECIOUS.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.652
- YEAH, GOT TO KEEP
MY THIGHS IN SHAPE,

04:44.685 --> 04:46.587
AND I DON'T MEAN
JUST FOR THE SLOPES.

WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

04:53.126 --> 04:55.696
- HOW LONG
HAVE YOU KNOWN TAD?

04:55.729 --> 04:56.997
- THREE WEEKS.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.966
- AND YOU DECIDED
TO CANCEL YOUR PLANS

04:58.999 --> 05:00.734
TO BE WITH YOUR FRIENDS
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY

05:00.768 --> 05:02.803
IN ORDER TO BE WITH HIM?

05:02.836 --> 05:04.071
- I NEED TO DO SOME PEC-DECK.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.473
THOSE LYCRA SKI SUITS
ARE UNFORGIVING.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.840
- TEDDY.

05:06.874 --> 05:07.975
- LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.677
YOU'RE JUST
FEELING JEALOUS

05:09.710 --> 05:11.345
BECAUSE I'VE FINALLY
FOUND THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.547
- NO, I AM NOT JEALOUS.

05:13.581 --> 05:14.948
NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME
HAPPIER

05:14.982 --> 05:16.817
THAN FOR YOU TO FIND
THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.552
BUT TO ALLOW SOMEONE THAT
YOU'VE KNOWN LESS THAN A MONTH

05:18.586 --> 05:20.821
TO ISOLATE YOU--
- HE'S NOT ISOLATING ME.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.690
I WANT TO BE WITH HIM,
AND I-I RESENT YOU

05:22.723 --> 05:24.858
ACCUSING HIM OF--
- HI, SWEETHEART.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.560
- HEY, HOW'S MY BABY?

05:26.594 --> 05:28.362
- VERY GOOD.
both: MMM.

05:28.396 --> 05:29.863

WE SHOULD CHECK IT OUT,
FOR THE TRIP.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.602
OH, HI, EMMETT.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.737
- HELLO, TAD.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.441
- "YOUR WIFE
DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW...

05:40.474 --> 05:44.111
NEITHER DOES
YOUR GIRLFRIEND."

05:44.144 --> 05:46.447
OUR RESEARCH INDICATES
THAT THE PRIMARY DEMO

05:46.480 --> 05:48.449
FOR YOUR NEW ERECTILE
DYSFUNCTION MEDICATION

05:48.482 --> 05:51.452
IS MEN BETWEEN
THE AGES OF 45 AND 75,

05:51.485 --> 05:53.120
WITH A COUPLE OF GENTS
IN THEIR 100s

05:53.153 --> 05:55.723
EXPRESSING KEEN INTEREST.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.459
AND THERE WAS ALSO
ANOTHER GROUP...

05:58.492 --> 06:01.462
NOT TO BE OVERLOOKED:

06:01.495 --> 06:02.796
"YOUR WIFE
DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW,

06:02.830 --> 06:04.998
AND NEITHER DOES
YOUR BOYFRIEND."

06:05.032 --> 06:08.469
- I FIND THIS CRUDE,
OFFENSIVE, AND SOPHOMORIC.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.003
MORE LIKE AMERICAN PIE
FOR SENIORS

06:10.037 --> 06:11.505
THAN AN AD
OFFERING HOPE FOR MILLIONS

06:11.539 --> 06:14.875
SUFFERING FROM
A SERIOUS MEDICAL PROBLEM.

06:14.908 --> 06:19.613
- I HAVE TO SAY,
I AGREE WITH MS. DIXON.

06:19.647 --> 06:24.752
- I WANT TO SEE
A HAPPILY MARRIED COUPLE...

06:24.785 --> 06:26.887
WITH FLECKS OF GRAY
IN THEIR HAIR,

06:26.920 --> 06:28.622
EMBRACING IN FRONT
OF A WARM FIRE

06:28.656 --> 06:32.192
WITH COPY THAT READS:
"REKINDLE THE FLAME."

06:32.225 --> 06:34.762
NOT SOME DIRTY JOKE.

06:34.795 --> 06:38.198
- THESE ARE CONSERVATIVE TIMES
WE'RE LIVING IN, BRIAN.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.869
SEX NO LONGER SELLS.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.640
- I KEEP PICTURING
THAT FAMOUS PHOTOGRAPH

06:46.674 --> 06:48.509
OF IMMIGRANTS
ARRIVING ON ELLIS ISLAND.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.177
THEY GIVE YOU A NEW NAME

06:50.210 --> 06:51.579
'CAUSE THEY CAN'T PRONOUNCE
THE ONE YOU'VE GOT.

06:51.612 --> 06:52.813
- "PETERSON"?

06:52.846 --> 06:54.515
- YOU MOVE INTO
A ONE-ROOM APARTMENT,

06:54.548 --> 06:56.550
START TAKING IN LAUNDRY
AND SPEAKING ENGLISH

06:56.584 --> 06:58.185
WITH A YIDDISH ACCENT.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.720
- HEY, HONEY,
IT'S TORONTO,

06:59.753 --> 07:01.855
NOT THE LOWER EAST SIDE.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.657
- MY COUSIN JEANNIE
SAID THERE'S A HOUSE FOR RENT

07:03.691 --> 07:05.125
DOWN THE STREET FROM HER
WITH A STARBUCKS

07:05.158 --> 07:06.560
AND A GAP ON THE CORNER.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.662
- OUR FUTURE'S SECURED.
- [laughs]

07:08.696 --> 07:10.664
- YOURS TOO.

07:10.698 --> 07:12.933
- OH, IT'LL BE STRANGE
NOT COMING OVER,

07:12.966 --> 07:15.068
SEEING YOU AND GUS AND JENNY.
- I KNOW.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.570
- YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO COME VISIT US.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.071
- YOU'LL ALWAYS
HAVE A PLACE TO STAY.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.807
- IF YOU EVER DECIDE
TO PACK YOUR BAGS AND LEAVE.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.476
- MEL.
- IT WAS A JOKE.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.945
I KNOW YOU AND BRIAN
WILL BE HAPPY.

07:24.978 --> 07:28.215
WE ALL WILL BE.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.984
- THE POLLS ARE SHOWING
THAT SINCE THE BOMBING,

07:31.018 --> 07:34.622
SUPPORT FOR "STOP PROP 14"
IS UP 28%.

07:34.655 --> 07:38.258
THE COMMITTEE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
WANTS TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE

07:38.291 --> 07:40.561
OF THIS SUDDEN GROUNDSWELL
OF SYMPATHY

07:40.594 --> 07:42.896
AND TURN IT
INTO A VICTORY.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.833
WE WANT TO SHOW
THE GENERAL POPULATION

07:45.866 --> 07:47.601
THAT THE GAY COMMUNITY

07:47.635 --> 07:50.571
IS NOT JUST THE TRANSVESTITES
AND LEATHER DADDIES

07:50.604 --> 07:52.740
THEY SEE
AT THE GAY PRIDE PARADE.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.242
BUT FOR THE MOST PART,
IT'S PEOPLE LIKE YOU,

07:55.275 --> 08:00.013
LIKE THEM, WITH A PARTNER,
A HOME, A FAMILY,

08:00.047 --> 08:01.515
WHO WERE VICTIMS
OF THIS...

08:01.549 --> 08:04.117
UNSPEAKABLE ACT OF VIOLENCE.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.753
- BUT WHAT DO I
HAVE TO DO WITH IT?

08:05.786 --> 08:07.888
- WE WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU
AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE,

08:07.921 --> 08:09.256
HAVE YOU SAY A FEW WORDS.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.991
- I-I'M NOT MUCH
OF A PUBLIC SPEAKER.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.259
I WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.727
- NOT TO WORRY.

08:13.761 --> 08:15.195
WE HAVE SOME EXCELLENT
SPEECH WRITERS

08:15.228 --> 08:17.598
WHO'LL BE YOUR VOICE.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.266
JUST GIVE US YOUR BODY.

HAD A PROPOSITION THAT TEMPTING

08:22.770 --> 08:24.137
IN A LONG TIME.

08:24.171 --> 08:27.074
- SO YOU'LL DO IT?

08:30.644 --> 08:33.814
- I'M ALL YOURS.

08:33.847 --> 08:37.551
[door opening]

08:39.653 --> 08:41.288
- WHAT ARE THOSE?

08:41.321 --> 08:44.224
- MY REVISED ADS
FOR REMSON'S INSTANT WOOD.

08:44.257 --> 08:45.826
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:45.859 --> 08:47.561
- AT THAT AGE, I THOUGHT
IF THEY'RE ON THE FLOOR,

08:47.595 --> 08:49.930
IT MEANT THEY'VE FALLEN
AND THEY CAN'T GET UP.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.833
- WHICH DO YOU PREFER?

08:52.866 --> 08:54.768
- [laughs]
NONE.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.304
- JUST BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T
WATCH GERIATRICS GONE WILD

08:57.337 --> 08:58.906
DOESN'T MEAN
THEY CAN'T DO IT.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.709
- I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.
IT'S NOT EDGY.

09:01.742 --> 09:05.846
IT'S NOT FUNNY.
IT'S NOT SEXY.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.715
- HAVEN'T YOU HEARD?

09:07.748 --> 09:10.684
SEX IS OUT.

09:10.718 --> 09:13.120
- WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

09:13.153 --> 09:14.922
NOW PUT ON YOUR SLUTTIEST
CLUB CLOTHES

09:14.955 --> 09:18.258
AND BRING PLENTY OF DRUGS,
'CAUSE WE'RE GOING OUT.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.661
- I WAS THINKING
WE'D SPEND A NICE,

09:20.694 --> 09:23.697
QUIET EVENING AT HOME.

09:23.731 --> 09:24.698

09:33.373 --> 09:35.142

- IT'S THE END OF YOUR LIFE
AS YOU KNOW IT.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.680
- YOUR FAREWELL APPEARANCE.
- KINNEY'S LAST STAND.

09:39.713 --> 09:42.750

A DRINK.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.359
- COME JOIN US.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.161

09:54.194 --> 09:55.963
YOU HURRY BACK.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.871
WHAT'LL IT BE?
THE USUAL?

10:03.904 --> 10:07.841
- UH, MAKE IT ONE FOR MY BABY
AND ONE FOR YOURS TRULY.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.109
- I SEE YOU HOOKED A HOTTIE.

10:09.142 --> 10:12.145

WITH THE BOSS' MONEY.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.752

10:18.786 --> 10:21.689
[laughs]
YOU'RE THE BEST.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.258
- HEY, TEDDY.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.894
- EM.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.796
- I JUST WANT TO SAY
I'M SORRY

10:28.829 --> 10:30.130
FOR WHAT I SAID ABOUT TAD.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.732
IF YOU LOVE HIM,

10:31.765 --> 10:33.901
I'M SURE HE MUST BE
A WONDERFUL PERSON

10:33.934 --> 10:38.171
BECAUSE YOU'RE
A WONDERFUL PERSON.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.273
AND IF YOU WANT
TO KNOW THE TRUTH, UH...

10:40.307 --> 10:42.743
I AM JEALOUS.

10:42.776 --> 10:46.880
BUT NOT BECAUSE, UH,
YOU HAVE HIM.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.817
BECAUSE HE HAS YOU.

10:51.451 --> 10:54.922
- [chuckles]
YOU STILL HAVE ME.

11:02.095 --> 11:05.065
GOTTA BRING THIS OVER.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.767
CRANBERRY AND SODA
POUR TOI,

11:06.800 --> 11:08.969
AND CRANBERRY AND SODA
POUR MOI.

11:09.002 --> 11:13.306
- YOU CAN SHOVE THEM BOTH
UP YOUR ASS.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.777
- TAD!

11:16.810 --> 11:18.478
TAD, WOULD YOU STOP?

11:18.511 --> 11:20.313
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:20.347 --> 11:23.316
- HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.785
LIKE I WAS INVISIBLE.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.920
- DO WHAT?
- YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.321
- I REALLY DON'T.
- YOU WANT A LIST?

11:28.355 --> 11:30.490
HOW ABOUT COMING ON
TO THAT BARTENDER?

11:30.523 --> 11:33.326
- WHA--RINGO?
I WASN'T COMING ON TO HIM.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.829
I WAS TELLING HIM ABOUT YOU,
AND HE WAS CONGRATULATING ME.

11:35.863 --> 11:37.397
HE--HE GAVE US FREE DRINKS.
- UH-HUH.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.866
AND WHAT ABOUT
YOUR BELOVED EMMETT?

11:38.899 --> 11:40.400
I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME
THAT WAS OVER.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.235
- IT IS OVER.
EMMETT IS A FRIEND, THAT'S ALL.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.471
- OH, REALLY? WELL, IT LOOKED
LIKE A LOT MORE THAN THAT TO ME.

11:44.504 --> 11:45.873
- WELL, WHATEVER YOU THINK
IT LOOKED LIKE,

11:45.906 --> 11:47.140
I WAS SOCIALIZING,
NOTHING MORE.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.076
- YOU CAN CALL IT
WHATEVER YOU WANT!

11:49.109 --> 11:50.811
I CALL IT BEING A SLUT!

11:50.844 --> 11:53.080
- EXCUSE ME?
- YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.481
WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO PUT UP
WITH THAT, OKAY?

11:54.514 --> 11:55.816
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN
INVOLVED WITH YOU

11:55.849 --> 11:57.084
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.251
WHY DON'T YOU
GO BACK TO YOUR FRIENDS?

11:58.285 --> 11:59.753
I NEVER WANT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

11:59.787 --> 12:02.389
FUCK YOU!

12:02.422 --> 12:04.758
[door slams]

12:04.792 --> 12:06.860
*

12:06.894 --> 12:09.296
- CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION,
PLEASE?

12:09.329 --> 12:14.401
I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER A TOAST
IN MEMORY OF BRIAN KINNEY.

12:14.434 --> 12:17.504
- OUTGOING, FRIENDLY--
SOME SAY TO A FAULT.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.840
HE NEVER MET A MAN
HE DIDN'T LIKE.

12:19.873 --> 12:20.841
[laughter]

12:20.874 --> 12:22.042
- IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS,

12:22.075 --> 12:24.544
BRIAN DREAMED
OF BEING A LAWYER.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.180
HE SAID, "I WANT
TO GET INNOCENT MEN OFF...

12:27.214 --> 12:29.016
[laughter]

12:29.049 --> 12:32.285
I'LL GO TO ANY LENGTH TO GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS."

12:32.319 --> 12:33.854
[laughter]

12:33.887 --> 12:35.122
- LATER ON IN LIFE,

12:35.155 --> 12:37.124
HE DEVOTED HIMSELF
TO VOLUNTEER WORK.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.458
- YES.
- IT'S TRUE.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.561
- IF HE HEARD
THAT SOMEONE WAS LAID UP,

12:41.594 --> 12:44.264
OR FLAT ON HIS BACK,

12:44.297 --> 12:48.435
HE'D COME TIME AND TIME AGAIN
UNTIL THEY FELT BETTER.

12:48.468 --> 12:49.803
[laughter]

12:49.837 --> 12:50.871
- SO...
[clears throat]

12:50.904 --> 12:52.539
NOW THAT HE'S GONE,

12:52.572 --> 12:55.943
I'M SURE THAT THERE'S
NOT A MAN IN THIS ROOM

12:55.976 --> 12:59.212
WHO WOULDN'T AGREE
THAT HE HAS LEFT A HOLE

12:59.246 --> 13:01.014
THAT CAN NEVER BE FILLED.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.883
[laughter]

13:02.916 --> 13:03.951
- HERE'S TO BRIAN.

13:03.984 --> 13:06.486
all: TO BRIAN!

13:08.088 --> 13:09.222
[cheering]

13:09.256 --> 13:11.158
- ALSO TO BRIAN.

13:11.191 --> 13:14.828
[cheering]

13:14.862 --> 13:18.565
*

13:18.598 --> 13:20.167
- A-HA...

13:20.200 --> 13:21.334
- GO FOR IT, BRIAN.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.570
- OH, I JUST WANT
TO SMACK IT.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.939
- NO TAN LINES.

13:25.973 --> 13:31.912
[cheering]

13:31.945 --> 13:33.080
- OKAY.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.215
WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.851
THE PRISONER
RESPECTFULLY CHOOSES

13:37.885 --> 13:40.053
NOT TO PARTAKE
OF HIS LAST MEAL...

13:40.087 --> 13:41.321
[all groan]

13:41.354 --> 13:43.957
BUT TO BE LED INSTEAD
TO THE GALLOWS

13:43.991 --> 13:47.627
A HUNGRY BUT HAPPY MAN.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.496
- GO ON.
HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.598
- IT AIN'T SO LITTLE.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.333
- NO, SERIOUSLY.
YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION.

13:53.366 --> 13:57.971
- HEY, I'M CONTENT
TO TAKE MY WINNINGS AND GO HOME.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.873
YOU GO FOR IT, EMMYLOU.

13:59.907 --> 14:02.109
- NO...
[laughs]

14:02.142 --> 14:03.110
OKAY.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.111
[laughter]

14:04.144 --> 14:05.345
- COME ON, TIGER.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.981
*

14:09.516 --> 14:13.086
- NOW REMEMBER, WHEN
THE BULL-DYKE MINISTER SAYS,

14:13.120 --> 14:17.024
[deep voice]
"MAY I HAVE THE RINGS, PLEASE?"

14:17.057 --> 14:20.093
THAT'S WHEN YOU BRING
THE RINGS TO DADDY, OKAY?

14:20.127 --> 14:22.429
- OKAY.
- NOW, LET'S PRACTICE.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.532
YOU GO STAND OVER THERE.

14:29.469 --> 14:30.971
READY?

14:31.004 --> 14:32.539
- YES.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.241
[deep voice]
MAY I HAVE THE RINGS, PLEASE?

14:34.274 --> 14:35.508
- [laughs]

14:35.542 --> 14:39.379
- HA HA!
GOOD BOY.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.281
YOU GET A KISS FOR THAT.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.116
- BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.118
YOU FINALLY GREW A HEART.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.020
- WELL, MAYBE
YOU'LL HAVE THE SAME LUCK

14:47.054 --> 14:48.255
GROWING A PENIS.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.523
- OKAY, BIG GUY,

14:50.557 --> 14:51.691
TIME FOR YOUR NAP.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.293
- NO, WE DIDN'T PLAY YET.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.528
- YOU'LL SEE DADDY LATER.
- [squealing]

14:55.562 --> 15:00.000
- BYE.
- BYE-BYE, COWBOY CHICKEN.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.668
- UH-UH, BUDDY-BOY.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.270
- [giggling]

15:03.303 --> 15:05.305
- [clears throat]

15:07.707 --> 15:10.677
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT,
DESPITE OUR PAST GRIEVANCES...

15:10.710 --> 15:13.680
- OH, CHRIST, CAN'T YOU DYKES
JUST LEAVE THE COUNTRY FOREVER

15:13.713 --> 15:17.050
WITHOUT MAKING A BIG DEAL
OUT OF IT?

15:17.084 --> 15:19.152
- WE'LL TRY OUR BEST.

15:19.186 --> 15:21.054
BUT BEFORE WE DO,

15:21.088 --> 15:24.091
I WANT TO WISH
YOU AND JUSTIN

15:24.124 --> 15:26.626
ALL THE HAPPINESS ON EARTH.

15:26.659 --> 15:31.064
I MEAN THAT.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.565
- AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M GLAD

15:32.599 --> 15:35.568
YOU'RE GOING TO BE HERE
FOR THE WEDDING.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.304
I MEAN THAT, TOO.

15:37.337 --> 15:41.208
- WHY THANK YOU, BRIAN.

15:41.241 --> 15:44.311
- IT WOULD'VE REALLY FUCKED UP
JUSTIN'S SEATING ARRANGEMENT.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.946
- [laughs]

15:50.217 --> 15:52.252
IT'S JUSTIN'S GIFT TO US.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.187
GOING-AWAY PRESENT.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.755
I FEEL LIKE GERTRUDE STEIN.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.625
- YOU'RE NOT THAT HEAVY...
YET.

15:58.658 --> 16:01.161
NO, I MEAN IT'S LIKE
HAVING A PICASSO

16:01.194 --> 16:03.096
BEFORE HE BECOMES PICASSO.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.365
- [inhales]

16:07.100 --> 16:08.601
HE REALLY IS GOOD,
ISN'T HE?

16:08.635 --> 16:10.203
- BETTER THAN GOOD.

16:10.237 --> 16:14.007
THAT'S WHY YOU BETTER
BE GOOD TO HIM...

16:14.041 --> 16:18.145
CONSIDERING WHAT HE'S
SACRIFICING TO BE WITH YOU.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.216
- MY SON MICHAEL'S
PRESS CONFERENCE--

16:23.250 --> 16:24.551
HAMBURGER MEDIUM,
FRUIT INSTEAD OF FRIES--

16:24.584 --> 16:26.486
TUESDAY AT 2:30--
CHICKEN CAESAR.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.122
DON'T FORGET.
DRESSING'S ON THE SIDE, HONEY.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.524
WHAT YOU STUDYING?
- THE TUDOR MONARCHS.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.626
- I FUCKING LOVED
ENGLISH HISTORY.

16:33.660 --> 16:37.130
GO AHEAD,
ASK ME A QUESTION.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.666
- THE WIVES OF HENRY VIII,
IN ORDER.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.101
- EASY.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.635
CATHERINE OF ARAGON,
ANNE BOLEYN,

16:42.669 --> 16:44.504
JANE SEYMOUR,
ANNE OF CLEVES,

16:44.537 --> 16:46.639
KATHRYN HOWARD...

16:46.673 --> 16:47.774
WHO IN THE HELL
WAS THE LAST ONE?

16:47.807 --> 16:50.510
KATHERINE PARR!
- WICKED.

16:50.543 --> 16:51.778
- HONEY, IF THERE'S
ONE THING I KNOW ABOUT,

16:51.811 --> 16:53.246
IT'S QUEENS.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.547
[bell dings]
- DEB, YOUR ORDER'S UP.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.449
- AND IF I HEAR
ONE MORE FUCKING DING,

16:56.483 --> 16:59.452
HIS HEAD'S GOING TO ROLL
FASTER THAN ANNE BOLEYN'S.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.121
DON'T FORGET
MICHAEL'S PRESS CONFERENCE,

17:01.154 --> 17:02.555
TUESDAY, 2:30.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.391
- THAT'S WHEN I'VE GOT
MY TRANNY SUPPORT GROUP.

17:04.424 --> 17:07.660
- SO BRING THEM ALONG.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.296
- THEN HE ACCUSED ME
OF COMING ON

17:09.329 --> 17:10.563
TO PRACTICALLY EVERY GUY
AT THE STAG PARTY,

17:10.597 --> 17:11.564
INCLUDING YOU.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.166
- THERE YOU GO, BABY.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.669
- AM I REPEATING MYSELF?

17:16.703 --> 17:18.705
I'M REPEATING MYSELF,
JUST LIKE MY UNCLE LOUIE.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.707
HE'D TELL THE SAME GODDAMN STORY
OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

17:20.740 --> 17:22.675
LIKE THE TIME HE PEED
NEXT TO BOB HOPE.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.344
- WELL, AUNT LULAH
ALWAYS SAID,

17:24.377 --> 17:25.845
"A GOOD STORY
IS WORTH RETELLING."

17:25.878 --> 17:28.415
SO YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.683
- HE BECAME THIS ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT PERSON.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.319
A PERSON I-I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.853
HE WAS SO LOVING,
AND SWEET,

17:33.886 --> 17:36.689
AND THEN HE TURNED INTO
THIS ANGRY, SUSPICIOUS...

17:36.723 --> 17:38.625
both: PUNITIVE...
- PARANOIAC?

17:38.658 --> 17:41.561
YEAH, IT'S A CLASSIC CASE OF
BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.163
- HOW COULD I HAVE NOT
SEEN IT COMING?

17:43.196 --> 17:45.298
- BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO.

17:45.332 --> 17:48.835
YOU WANTED TO BE IN LOVE.
WHO DOESN'T?

17:48.868 --> 17:50.637
SO STOP
BEATING YOURSELF UP.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.439
JUST BE GLAD IT'S OVER.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.174
THAT YOU FOUND OUT BEFORE
HE LOCKED YOU IN YOUR ROOM,

17:54.207 --> 17:56.709
TIED YOU TO YOUR BED,
AND FED YOU YOUR DEAD PARAKEET.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.712
[both chuckle]

17:59.746 --> 18:01.314
- YEAH, I SUPPOSE.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.650
- THE RIGHT GUY
WILL COME ALONG, TEDDY.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.153
- YOU'LL SEE.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.157
- SHAKE?

18:11.758 --> 18:14.727
- RIGHT THIS WAY, GENTLEMEN.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.796
- OH, UH, I WAS PLANNING
ON WEARING THIS

18:16.829 --> 18:19.266
SUIT TO THE WEDDING,
BUT WITH A DIFFERENT TIE.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.533
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

18:20.567 --> 18:22.535
WHAT, ARE YOU
TRYING TO UPSTAGE ME?

18:22.569 --> 18:26.739
- I JUST WANT TO LOOK MY BEST.
- [clears throat]

18:26.773 --> 18:29.776
DOESN'T MATTER TO ME
IF YOU'RE NAKED,

18:29.809 --> 18:31.878
AS LONG AS YOU'RE THERE
TO GIVE ME AWAY.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.646
OH, WELL, IN THAT CASE,

18:33.680 --> 18:36.483
MAYBE I SHOULD WEAR
MY BLACK LEATHER PANTS.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.485
- WHAT? YOU MEAN
THE ONES YOU WORE--

18:38.518 --> 18:41.488
- THE FIRST NIGHT
WE WENT TO BABYLON.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.223
- THEY WERE SO TIGHT,
YOU COULD BARELY MOVE.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.524
- I KNOW,
MY BALLS WERE KILLING ME.

18:44.557 --> 18:45.892
AND THAT SHIRT
YOU WERE WEARING.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.694
- WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE SHIRT
I WAS WEARING?

18:47.727 --> 18:49.762
- NO SELF-RESPECTING PIMP
WOULD BE CAUGHT DEAD IN THAT.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.231
- [laughs]
I THOUGHT I LOOKED PRETTY HOT.

18:51.264 --> 18:54.201
- YOU DID LOOK PRETTY HOT.

18:56.536 --> 19:00.139
THAT NIGHT, I-I JERKED OFF
THINKING ABOUT YOU.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.776
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

19:03.810 --> 19:05.812
I JERKED OFF
THINKING ABOUT ME TOO.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.815
[both laughing]

19:10.483 --> 19:12.252
- [sighs]

19:12.285 --> 19:13.820
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT THAT ONE DAY,
BABYLON WOULD BE GONE

19:13.853 --> 19:16.189
AND WE'D BE
SITTING HERE IN SUITS?

19:16.223 --> 19:21.661
- TALKING ABOUT OUR WILD
AND RECKLESSLY DRESSED YOUTH.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.863
- PATHETIC, HUH?

19:23.896 --> 19:27.567
- INEVITABLE.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.536
- GENTLEMEN.

19:29.569 --> 19:30.537
- MERLOT.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.272
- UH, PEPSI.

19:32.305 --> 19:36.643
- UH--UH, MAKE THAT
A GLASS OF WHITE WINE.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.617
- ALMOST READY.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

19:44.651 --> 19:46.753
- HE'S SCARED SHITLESS.
- [laughs]

19:46.786 --> 19:48.355
- I'M FINE, THANK YOU.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.956
- JUST STICK TO YOUR SPEECH

19:49.989 --> 19:51.824
AND I'M SURE
YOU'LL DO SPLENDIDLY.

19:51.858 --> 19:55.295
- UM, EXCUSE ME.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.297
EXCUSE ME, HONEY.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.831
SORRY, SWEETHEART, I THINK
THESE ARE OUR SEATS.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.567
MY--MY SON'S SPEAKING.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.869
THANK YOU.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.872
MY SON'S SPEAKING.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.443
- WHO ARE THEY?
- HIS MOTHER AND HER FRIENDS.

20:10.477 --> 20:11.778
- THEY CAN'T SIT THERE.

20:11.811 --> 20:15.415
MOVE THEM TO THE BACK,
OUT OF CAMERA RANGE.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.323
- SO IF YOU DON'T MIND
MOVING DOWN...

20:23.356 --> 20:27.860
THERE'S A LITTLE MORE ROOM
IN THE BACK. THANKS.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.329
- IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

20:29.362 --> 20:30.863
- OH, JUST A LITTLE
MISUNDERSTANDING.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.732
THOSE SEATS
WERE ALREADY RESERVED.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.033
- FOR WHO?

20:34.066 --> 20:37.470
- FOR COUPLES WITH CHILDREN,
LIKE YOURSELVES.

20:37.504 --> 20:41.774
I APOLOGIZE
FOR THE MIX-UP.

20:42.809 --> 20:47.747
[mixed chatter]

20:47.780 --> 20:50.016
GOOD AFTERNOON
AND WELCOME.

20:50.049 --> 20:54.887
[applause]

20:54.921 --> 20:57.690
I'M CONGRESSWOMAN
BETH EDELSTEIN.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.393
THE COMMITTEE
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS

21:00.427 --> 21:03.830
HAS CALLED TODAY'S
PRESS CONFERENCE IN RESPONSE

21:03.863 --> 21:06.633
TO THE UNCONSCIONABLE
ACT OF VIOLENCE

21:06.666 --> 21:08.935
THAT TOOK THE LIVES OF SEVEN

21:08.968 --> 21:11.771
AND CRITICALLY INJURED
DOZENS OF OTHERS

21:11.804 --> 21:16.643
AT A RECENT BENEFIT
TO STOP PROPOSITION 14.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.978
WE EXPRESS OUR SYMPATHIES
TO THE FAMILIES

21:19.011 --> 21:21.047
WHO LOST THEIR LOVED ONES,

21:21.080 --> 21:24.451
AND VOW TO CONTINUE
FIGHTING FOR EQUAL RIGHTS

21:24.484 --> 21:28.054
FOR ALL AMERICANS,
STRAIGHT AND GAY.

21:28.087 --> 21:32.992
[applause]

21:35.428 --> 21:37.864
NOW, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
ONE OF THE SURVIVORS

21:37.897 --> 21:41.934
OF THAT SENSELESS TRAGEDY,
MICHAEL NOVOTNY.

21:41.968 --> 21:47.874
[applause]

21:56.483 --> 22:00.420
- THANK YOU,
CONGRESSWOMAN.

22:00.453 --> 22:01.554
[clears throat]

22:01.588 --> 22:02.689
"THANK YOU,
CONGRESSWOMAN."

22:02.722 --> 22:05.425
OH.
I-I ALREADY SAID THAT PART.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.959
[laughter]

22:06.993 --> 22:09.028
"IT'S AN HONOR
TO STAND HERE TODAY,

22:09.061 --> 22:10.963
"CONSIDERING
A FEW WEEKS AGO,

22:10.997 --> 22:13.733
"THE DOCTORS WEREN'T SURE
I WAS GOING TO MAKE IT.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.868
"BUT I WAS ONE
OF THE LUCKY ONES.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.870
"I'M HERE.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.739
"AND AS TERRIFYING
AS THAT EVENING WAS,

22:19.772 --> 22:21.874
"I WOULD BE THERE AGAIN
TO DEFEAT A BILL

22:21.908 --> 22:23.776
"THAT WOULD DENY
RIGHTS TO AMERICANS

22:23.810 --> 22:24.977
"JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE GAY.

22:25.011 --> 22:31.984
[applause]

22:32.018 --> 22:34.587
"I HAVE A LOVING PARTNER
AND TWO WONDERFUL KIDS,

22:34.621 --> 22:37.023
"A HOME, A SMALL BUSINESS.

22:37.056 --> 22:42.028
THE TRUTH IS,
I'M JUST LIKE YOU."

22:49.502 --> 22:54.874
[audience murmuring]

22:54.907 --> 22:59.879
ACTUALLY,
THAT'S NOT THE TRUTH.

22:59.912 --> 23:03.750
SURE, IN A LOT OF WAYS,
I AM JUST LIKE YOU.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.618
I WANT TO BE HAPPY.

23:05.652 --> 23:06.819
I WANT SOME SECURITY,

23:06.853 --> 23:08.488
A LITTLE EXTRA
MONEY IN MY POCKET.

23:08.521 --> 23:14.561
BUT IN MANY WAYS,
MY LIFE IS NOTHING LIKE YOURS.

23:14.594 --> 23:17.664
WHY SHOULD IT BE?

23:17.697 --> 23:18.898
DO WE ALL HAVE
TO HAVE THE SAME LIVES

23:18.931 --> 23:20.066
TO HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS?

23:20.099 --> 23:22.769
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
THAT DIVERSITY

23:22.802 --> 23:26.706
WAS WHAT THIS COUNTRY
WAS ALL ABOUT.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.509
IN THE GAY COMMUNITY,
WE HAVE DRAG QUEENS

23:29.542 --> 23:32.679
AND LEATHER DADDIES
AND TRANNIES

23:32.712 --> 23:38.685
AND COUPLES WITH CHILDREN
EVERY COLOR OF THE RAINBOW.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.820
MY MOTHER,
WHO'S STANDING WAY IN THE BACK

23:40.853 --> 23:46.593
WITH SOME FRIENDS,
MY FRIENDS...

23:46.626 --> 23:50.062
ONCE TOLD ME THAT PEOPLE
ARE LIKE SNOWFLAKES,

23:50.096 --> 23:53.700
EVERY ONE SPECIAL
AND UNIQUE,

23:53.733 --> 23:56.936
AND IN THE MORNING, YOU HAVE
TO SHOVEL THEM OFF THE DRIVEWAY.

23:56.969 --> 24:01.541
[laughter]

24:01.574 --> 24:06.813
BUT BEING DIFFERENT
IS WHAT MAKES US ALL THE SAME.

24:06.846 --> 24:11.651
IT'S WHAT MAKES US...
FAMILY.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.087
- YEAH.
- HEAR, HEAR!

24:15.121 --> 24:21.060
[applause]

24:35.908 --> 24:39.145
[knock at door]

24:45.317 --> 24:47.253
- GUESS WHAT? I CALLED
THE LODGE AT MOUNT FLAME

24:47.286 --> 24:48.855
AND GOT US AN UPGRADE.

24:48.888 --> 24:52.158
ONE OF THEIR DELUXE SUITES
ON THE CLUB FLOOR:

24:52.191 --> 24:54.527
FIREPLACE, TERRACE,
WITH A JACUZZI.

24:54.561 --> 24:56.629
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:56.663 --> 24:58.130
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

24:58.164 --> 24:59.999
I MEAN AFTER THAT
LITTLE CHARACTER ASSASSINATION

25:00.032 --> 25:02.068
YOU PERFORMED ON ME, I THOUGHT
I'D NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.603
- OH, LET'S JUST
FORGET ABOUT THAT.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.605
- I DON'T WANT
TO FORGET ABOUT THAT.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.607
- I TOLD YOU I HAD
A FEW FLAWS, DIDN'T I?

25:07.640 --> 25:10.276
- THAT'S MORE THAN A FLAW.
THAT'S A SERIOUS MALFUNCTION.

25:10.309 --> 25:12.011
- WELL, I JUST--SOMETIMES,
I JUST GET A LITTLE JEALOUS.

25:12.044 --> 25:15.047
THAT'S ALL.
- THAT'S ALL?

25:15.081 --> 25:18.050
- YEAH, BUT IT'S ONLY
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

25:19.652 --> 25:23.690
AND YOU LOVE ME.
YOU KNOW YOU DO.

25:23.723 --> 25:27.660
- I LOVED THE PERSON
I THOUGHT I KNEW.

25:28.795 --> 25:32.164
- I'M STILL THE SAME PERSON.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.933
- WELL, I'M NOT.

25:33.966 --> 25:37.704
NOW, I WANT YOU TO GO.

25:37.737 --> 25:38.971
- I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.707
- LOOK, I'M ASKING YOU
TO LEAVE.

25:40.740 --> 25:43.342
- TED, YOU'LL GET OVER THIS.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.778
- I ALREADY HAVE.

25:45.812 --> 25:48.815
SO, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'VE HAD A REALLY LONG DAY.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.049
[door slams]

25:50.082 --> 25:52.652
- NO, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.320
YOU CAN'T GET RID OF ME.

25:54.353 --> 25:57.056
- LOOK, DON'T MAKE ME
FORCE YOU.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.659
- LET GO.
- THEN LEAVE, NOW!

25:59.692 --> 26:00.793
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

26:00.827 --> 26:02.795
I TRUSTED YOU,
I LOVED YOU.

26:02.829 --> 26:04.196
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE A GOOD PERSON.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.065
- I AM A GOOD PERSON.
- NO, YOU'RE SHIT!

26:06.098 --> 26:07.333
WHO THE FUCK DO YOU
THINK YOU ARE,

26:07.366 --> 26:09.802
TREATING ME LIKE THIS?

26:09.836 --> 26:11.938
NO! NO!
- I SAID I WANT YOU OUT.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.673
I SAID I WANT YOU OUT.
- TED!

26:13.706 --> 26:15.875
- GET THE FUCK OUT!
- TED!

26:15.908 --> 26:19.345
TED!
[knock at door]

26:19.378 --> 26:21.948
OPEN THE DOOR.

26:21.981 --> 26:25.985
[knocking]
TED?

26:26.018 --> 26:28.988
[sobbing]
TED? TED?

26:29.021 --> 26:32.224
TED, PLEASE,
OPEN THE DOOR.

26:32.258 --> 26:34.727
- [exhales]
- TED.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.901
- I HAD A DREAM LAST NIGHT

26:41.934 --> 26:45.304
THAT WE WERE
IN OUR NEW HOUSE.

26:45.337 --> 26:47.874
- COOKING?

26:47.907 --> 26:50.009
GARDENING?

26:50.042 --> 26:51.844
SITTING IN FRONT
OF THE FIRE?

26:51.878 --> 26:56.749
- [chuckles]
NOT EXACTLY.

26:56.783 --> 26:59.852
YOU WERE RIDING ME
IN THE STABLE,

26:59.886 --> 27:02.388
DIVING INTO ME
IN THE POOL,

27:02.421 --> 27:06.158
SLAMMING ME
ON THE TENNIS COURT.

27:07.827 --> 27:11.263
- WELL, THAT GIVES
A NEW MEANING TO U.S. OPEN.

27:11.297 --> 27:15.634
- I BETTER START
PRACTICING MY SERVE.

27:18.037 --> 27:21.841
- WOULDN'T YOU RATHER
JUST CUDDLE?

27:24.310 --> 27:25.945
- WHAT?
- I SAID WOULDN'T YOU RATHER

27:25.978 --> 27:27.279
JUST LIE HERE AND--
- NO. NO, NO.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.948
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID.
YOU SAID "CUDDLE."

27:28.981 --> 27:30.750
- SO?

27:30.783 --> 27:33.686
- SO, I HAVE NEVER,
EVER ONCE

27:33.720 --> 27:35.154
HEARD YOU
EVEN USE THAT WORD,

27:35.187 --> 27:37.289
MUCH LESS
ACTUALLY WANT TO DO IT.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.425
- OKAY, SO CAN WE
JUST TURN THE LIGHTS OUT?

27:39.458 --> 27:41.761
- NO! NO.

27:41.794 --> 27:44.897
BRIAN KINNEY FUCKS,
SUCKS, RIMS, RAMS,

27:44.931 --> 27:47.466
BUT NEVER CUDDLES.

27:47.499 --> 27:50.336
- OKAY, SO I USED A WORD
THAT OFFENDS YOUR SENSIBILITIES.

27:50.369 --> 27:51.804
- OH...
- FORGIVE ME.

27:51.838 --> 27:54.340
I APOLOGIZE.
I'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.308
- NO.
IT'S MORE THAN JUST THAT.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.110
EVERY DAY WE GET CLOSER
TO BEING MARRIED,

27:58.144 --> 28:00.046
THE PERSON
I KNOW GETS FURTHER AWAY.

28:00.079 --> 28:04.216
- I'M RIGHT HERE,
- BUT IT'S NOT YOU.

28:04.250 --> 28:07.053
LOOKS LIKE YOU,
FEELS LIKE YOU, BUT YOU--

28:07.086 --> 28:09.055
YOU WOULD NEVER...

28:09.088 --> 28:10.056
[sighs]

28:10.089 --> 28:11.457
GO TO YOUR OWN STAG PARTY

28:11.490 --> 28:14.260
AND NOT FUCK
EVERY HOT GUY IN SIGHT.

28:14.293 --> 28:16.362
YOU WOULD NEVER
BE MORE INTERESTED IN GARDENING

28:16.395 --> 28:17.930
THAN GETTING LAID.

28:17.964 --> 28:20.466
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

28:20.499 --> 28:24.703
- I WANT YOU TO DO
WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY, NOT ME.

28:29.842 --> 28:32.812
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- [sighs]

28:32.845 --> 28:34.346
- YES, YOU.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.115
- NOT GOING TO NEW YORK?

28:36.148 --> 28:37.349
- FUCK NEW YORK.

28:37.383 --> 28:38.384
- CONQUERING THE ART WORLD?

28:38.417 --> 28:40.252
- FUCK THE ART WORLD.

28:40.286 --> 28:43.355
- WHY?
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID?

28:43.389 --> 28:45.091
- I'M NOT AFRAID.
- THEN WHAT?

28:45.124 --> 28:46.959
- I DON'T WANT IT.
- BULLSHIT.

28:46.993 --> 28:49.128
- I DON'T.
IT MEANS NOTHING.

28:49.161 --> 28:52.431
- WOULD IT STILL MEAN NOTHING
IF I WASN'T HERE?

28:52.464 --> 28:54.100
- [sighs]

28:54.133 --> 28:56.535
HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO GIVE YOU A RATIONAL RESPONSE

28:56.568 --> 28:58.304
WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES
YOU'VE PRESENTED

28:58.337 --> 29:00.139
ARE COMPLETELY SUPPOSITIONAL
AND, AS SUCH,

29:00.172 --> 29:02.108
HAVE NO BASIS IN REALITY?

29:02.141 --> 29:03.175
- JUST ANSWER
THE GODDAMN QUESTION.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.912
- [sighs]
I DON'T KNOW!

29:05.945 --> 29:08.480
[groans]

29:14.553 --> 29:17.023
- WELL, I DO.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.160
I DON'T WANT
TO LIVE WITH SOMEONE

29:21.193 --> 29:23.395
WHO SACRIFICED THEIR LIFE

29:23.429 --> 29:27.133
AND CALLED IT LOVE...

29:27.166 --> 29:31.270
TO BE WITH ME.

29:31.303 --> 29:35.374
- [sighs]
NEITHER DO I.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.291
- TA-DA!

29:52.324 --> 29:53.826
- WHAT'S THAT?

29:53.860 --> 29:55.327
- IT'S A QUADRUPLE BYPASS
SUNDAE.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.296
- [laughs]
- FOUR KINDS OF ICE CREAM.

29:57.329 --> 29:58.965
FOUR KINDS OF TOPPINGS.
FOUR KINDS OF SAUCE.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.299
- YOU WANT TO GIVE ME
A HEART ATTACK?

30:00.332 --> 30:02.068
- IT'S THE ONLY THING
I COULD THINK OF

30:02.101 --> 30:04.036
THAT WAS SWEETER THAN YOU.

30:04.070 --> 30:06.973
- WELL, I GUESS IT BEATS
GETTING WHOPPED UPSIDE THE HEAD,

30:07.006 --> 30:08.307
SO...
[smack]

30:08.340 --> 30:09.575
- UH.
- OH--

30:09.608 --> 30:11.610
JESUS, MA!
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT FOR?

30:11.643 --> 30:14.446
- THAT'S TO REMIND YOU
WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO YOU

30:14.480 --> 30:17.216
IF YOU EVER STOP BEING
THE MOST LOVING SON

30:17.249 --> 30:20.452
A MOTHER HAS EVER HAD.

30:20.486 --> 30:21.520
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE, BEN?

30:21.553 --> 30:24.156
- OH, I'D BE SCARED NOT TO.

30:27.393 --> 30:29.628
- HEY, KID.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.831
CAN YOU BRING US SOME WATER?

30:34.533 --> 30:39.371
- DID YOU EVER HEAR
OF "PLEASE"?

30:39.405 --> 30:41.073
- SIT DOWN.

30:41.107 --> 30:44.610
- WHAT'D I DO NOW?

30:44.643 --> 30:45.945
- WE GOT YOUR REPORT CARD.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.947
- OH, SHIT.

30:47.980 --> 30:51.617
- YOU PASSED EVERY SUBJECT
WITH "B"s AND "C"s.

30:51.650 --> 30:53.986
- NO SHIT?
- THAT'S AWESOME, DUDE.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.622
THAT MEANS YOU GET TO GRADUATE
WITH YOUR CLASS.

30:56.655 --> 30:59.091
- NEXT STEP, M.I.T.

30:59.125 --> 31:02.528
THAT'S THE MONONGAHELA
INSTITUTE OF TYPING.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.364
WHAT'S THIS?

31:05.397 --> 31:08.901
- IT'S A JOURNAL,
TO WRITE STUFF IN.

31:10.669 --> 31:11.971
- "H.N.B."

31:12.004 --> 31:14.273
- THEY'RE YOUR INITIALS,

31:14.306 --> 31:17.143
IF YOU'D LIKE THEM TO BE.

31:17.176 --> 31:20.279
- HUNTER NOVOTNY-BRUCKNER.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.314
- INSTEAD OF
BEING OUR FOSTER SON,

31:22.348 --> 31:25.451
WE'D LIKE YOU
TO BE OUR REAL SON.

31:25.484 --> 31:29.688
THAT IS, IF YOU'D LIKE US
TO BE YOUR FATHERS.

31:29.721 --> 31:33.025
- YOU MEAN,
YOU WANT TO ADOPT ME?

31:33.059 --> 31:37.463
- AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,
IN CASE PROP 14 PASSES.

31:43.035 --> 31:46.605
- SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

31:49.475 --> 31:54.013
"TODAY,
MICHAEL AND BEN ASKED ME

31:54.046 --> 31:57.216
"TO BE THEIR SON...

32:00.586 --> 32:03.622
I SAID 'YES.'"

32:08.094 --> 32:14.066
[mixed chatter]

32:16.135 --> 32:17.436
- IT'S A REHEARSAL DINNER,
BUT WHAT'S TO REHEARSE?

32:17.469 --> 32:20.039
THEY SAY, "I DO,"
THEN THEY DO IT.

32:20.072 --> 32:22.474
- BUT WHAT DO YOU GET THE MAN
WHO'S HAD EVERYONE?

32:22.508 --> 32:24.076
[laughter]

32:24.110 --> 32:26.112
- A WATER BUFFALO.

32:26.145 --> 32:28.447
- WHY THE HELL WOULD BRIAN
WANT TO FUCK THAT?

32:28.480 --> 32:31.050
- IT'S TO HELP CAMBODIAN FARMERS
PLOW THEIR FIELDS

32:31.083 --> 32:33.085
AND PROVIDE MILK
FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

32:33.119 --> 32:35.454
- WELL, THAT
IS SO MUCH MORE IMAGINATIVE

32:35.487 --> 32:37.456
THAN ANOTHER BORING OLD...

32:37.489 --> 32:40.326
STERLING SILVER PLACE SETTING
FROM TIFFANY'S.

32:40.359 --> 32:43.595
- JUSTIN'S ALREADY GOTTEN
EVERYTHING HE'S EVER WANTED.

32:43.629 --> 32:46.332
- I KNOW HOW HE FEELS.

32:46.365 --> 32:49.601
- [chuckles]

32:49.635 --> 32:52.004
all: HEY!

32:52.038 --> 32:56.742
[cheers and applause]

32:56.775 --> 32:58.244
- TO THE COUPLE!

32:58.277 --> 33:00.112
- WE WOULD LIKE
TO THANK YOU ALL

33:00.146 --> 33:01.480
FOR COMING
TO OUR REHEARSAL DINNER.

33:01.513 --> 33:04.250
- HA!

33:04.283 --> 33:08.120
- HOWEVER,
THERE'S NOTHING TO REHEARSE.

33:08.154 --> 33:11.190
THE WEDDING'S OFF.

33:13.525 --> 33:18.364
[awkward chuckles]

33:18.397 --> 33:20.132
- NO, IT'S TRUE.

33:20.166 --> 33:24.136
WE DECIDED
NOT TO GET MARRIED.

33:33.145 --> 33:36.182
- HOW THE FUCK DO YOU RETURN
A WATER BUFFALO?

33:38.684 --> 33:40.252
- BASED ON OUR
PREVIOUS DISCUSSION,

33:40.286 --> 33:43.155
I CAME UP WITH
A CAMPAIGN THAT'S MORE...

33:43.189 --> 33:44.823
IN LINE WITH YOUR VISION.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.293
CYNTHIA.

33:50.562 --> 33:52.798
- NOW WE'RE COOKING.
NICE WORK, BRIAN.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.600
- IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

33:54.633 --> 33:58.070
INTIMATE, WARM,
ROMANTIC.

33:58.104 --> 34:01.307
- ALL THE FEELINGS A WOMAN
ASSOCIATES WITH LOVE-MAKING.

34:01.340 --> 34:03.142
RIGHT, CYNTHIA?

34:03.175 --> 34:05.544
- UH, SOME WOMEN.

34:05.577 --> 34:07.713
- BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.615
WOMEN AREN'T GOING
TO BE BUYING A LITTLE PILL

34:09.648 --> 34:11.750
TO MAKE THEIR DICKS HARD.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.219
MEN ARE.

34:13.252 --> 34:14.553
STRAIGHT, GAY,

34:14.586 --> 34:16.588
DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN.
DOESN'T MATTER.

34:16.622 --> 34:19.291
THEY'RE ALL PAYING
TEN BUCKS A POP

34:19.325 --> 34:21.327
FOR THE SAME REASON.

34:21.360 --> 34:26.565
AND TRUST ME, MS. DIXON,
IT'S NOT TO REKINDLE THE FLAME.

34:26.598 --> 34:29.101
THEY WANT TO FUCK.
- [clears throat]

34:29.135 --> 34:30.836
- THEY WANT TO SHOOT
THEIR LOADS

34:30.869 --> 34:34.240
AS OFTEN AS THEY CAN,
AS HARD AS THEY CAN,

34:34.273 --> 34:36.442
ALL NIGHT LONG,
IF THEY CAN.

34:36.475 --> 34:38.110
NOT CUDDLE
IN FRONT OF THE FIRE

34:38.144 --> 34:41.713
WITH SOME NICE LADY
WHO LOOKS LIKE THEIR MOTHER.

34:41.747 --> 34:44.383
- DESPITE YOUR PERSONAL
FEELINGS, WE WANT THE AD.

34:44.416 --> 34:47.386
- YOU CAN'T HAVE IT.

34:47.419 --> 34:50.656
BECAUSE, DESPITE
THESE CONSERVATIVE TIMES,

34:50.689 --> 34:54.260
IT'S STILL ALL ABOUT SEX.

34:54.293 --> 34:56.328
AND IT ALWAYS WILL BE.

34:56.362 --> 35:00.566
SO I SUGGEST THAT YOU
TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.246
- I MADE US
A LITTLE SOMETHING.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.815
- THANKS.
I AM FAMISHED.

35:16.848 --> 35:19.151
I TAGGED ALL THE PIECES
WE'RE GOING TO PUT IN STORAGE,

35:19.185 --> 35:21.153
THE ONES WE'RE SELLING,
AND THE ONES WE'RE GIVING AWAY.

35:21.187 --> 35:22.354
- I DON'T SUPPOSE
THERE'S ANY POINT

35:22.388 --> 35:24.256
IN KEEPING THIS OLD TABLE.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.658
- CHRIST,
YOU'RE SUCH A SHIKSEH.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.760
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY IT?
YOU WANT THE TABLE.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.896
- I DON'T, I JUST THOUGHT
IT'S A SHAME TO--

35:30.929 --> 35:33.765
- [laughs]
- ALL RIGHT, I WANT THE TABLE.

35:33.799 --> 35:37.169
- GOOD, THEN WE'LL KEEP IT.
- [groans]

35:37.203 --> 35:40.272
I KEEP TELLING MYSELF
IT'S JUST A HOUSE.

35:40.306 --> 35:43.242
A BUNCH OF NOT-VERY-GRAND
OR EVEN SPACIOUS ROOMS,

35:43.275 --> 35:45.844
BUT EVERYWHERE I LOOK,
I SEE US.

35:45.877 --> 35:50.382
[chuckles]
LIKE OVER THERE, AT GUS' BRIS.

35:50.416 --> 35:53.252
- YOU TWO,
IN THE KITCHEN,

35:53.285 --> 35:54.786
NOW!

35:54.820 --> 35:59.691
- YOU MEAN, HIS ALMOST BRIS.

35:59.725 --> 36:03.195
OR THE FRONT GATE,
WHERE I PROPOSED TO YOU.

36:03.229 --> 36:06.298
[laughter]

36:08.300 --> 36:11.470
OR THE TIME
I WAS SITTING THERE, AND...

36:11.503 --> 36:12.971
YOU TOLD ME...

36:13.004 --> 36:17.943
- I'LL STAY UNTIL
AFTER THE BABY'S BORN.

36:17.976 --> 36:20.946
- WHAT?

36:20.979 --> 36:24.716
- NOTHING.
JUST A BAD MEMORY.

36:24.750 --> 36:28.287
- THEY'RE PART OF US TOO.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.489
WITHOUT THEM...

36:30.522 --> 36:34.460
HOW DO WE APPRECIATE
THE GOOD ONES?

36:39.598 --> 36:44.503
- WHAT DO YOU SAY...
WE MAKE ONE MORE MEMORY?

36:54.380 --> 36:59.918
[mixed chatter]

36:59.951 --> 37:04.022
- MMM, THE GLORIES OF NATURE.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.458
THE "BEAUTIFUL
FOR SPACIOUS SKIES,"

37:06.492 --> 37:09.461
THE "PURPLE MOUNTAINS
MAJESTY."

37:09.495 --> 37:10.996
- DON'T FORGET
THE "FRUITED PLAINS."

37:11.029 --> 37:13.499
- [chuckling]
AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU CAME?

37:13.532 --> 37:16.602
- MMM, THRILLED.

37:16.635 --> 37:20.506
WOULD HAVE LOST THE ROOM DEPOSIT
IF WE HADN'T.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.040
- WELL, HONEY, I KNOW
IT'S NOT EXACTLY

37:22.073 --> 37:25.477
THE ROMANTIC GETAWAY
YOU'D HOPED FOR, BUT, UM...

37:25.511 --> 37:26.645
I PROMISE YOU,
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

37:26.678 --> 37:28.514
A FABULOUS BIRTHDAY ANYWAY.

37:28.547 --> 37:29.515
[clapping]
HMM!

37:29.548 --> 37:31.950
- [chuckles]

37:31.983 --> 37:33.752
GOD. OH, GOD.

37:33.785 --> 37:35.421
TALK ABOUT
YOUR FIRE HAZARD.

37:35.454 --> 37:37.556
THAT THING'S
MORE FLAMING THAN YOU.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.391
JEEZ.
- IT'S 40 CANDLES.

37:39.425 --> 37:40.892
ONE FOR EVERY YEAR,
PLUS ONE TO GROW ON.

37:40.926 --> 37:43.362
- OH, DO YOU
HAVE TO REMIND ME?

37:43.395 --> 37:44.530
- WELL,
IT'S QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT

37:44.563 --> 37:47.366
TO GET TO BE YOUR AGE.

37:47.399 --> 37:49.368
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
- [scoffs]

37:49.401 --> 37:51.370
- WELL, HURRY UP AND MAKE A WISH
BEFORE THE PLACE BURNS DOWN.

37:51.403 --> 37:53.939
- [chuckles]

37:53.972 --> 37:58.076
YOU KNOW, EVERY YEAR, I ALWAYS
WISH FOR THE SAME THING:

37:58.109 --> 38:03.281
A BOYFRIEND.
SOMEONE TO LOVE, WHO'LL LOVE ME.

38:07.886 --> 38:12.958
THIS YEAR, I THINK I'M GOING
TO WISH FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

38:12.991 --> 38:16.061
THE WISDOM AND THE MATURITY
TO REALIZE THAT...

38:16.094 --> 38:19.030
I WON'T FIND WHAT I WANT
BY LOOKING FOR IT.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.334
NOT EXPECT SOMEONE ELSE
TO GIVE ME

38:22.368 --> 38:26.472
WHAT I NEVER GAVE MYSELF.

38:26.505 --> 38:30.642
THAT I'M NOT A HALF
WAITING TO BE MADE A WHOLE.

38:34.380 --> 38:39.317
AND EVEN IF THAT SPECIAL PERSON
NEVER COMES ALONG...

38:48.627 --> 38:51.597
I'LL BE JUST FINE.

39:05.544 --> 39:09.114
- TED?

39:09.147 --> 39:10.516
- BLAKE?

39:10.549 --> 39:12.718
- I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.720
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

39:14.753 --> 39:17.989
- I'M ON THE GAY SKI TEAM NOW.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.726
AND IT'S GAY SKI WEEK.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.861
- RIGHT.
[both laugh]

39:22.894 --> 39:26.031
- [laughs]
UH, YOU REMEMBER--

39:26.064 --> 39:27.599
- EMMETT.

39:27.633 --> 39:30.135
- YEAH, WOW.
UH, WHAT A SURPRISE.

39:30.168 --> 39:32.871
AND TEDDY WAS JUST ABOUT
TO HANG UP HIS SKIS.

39:32.904 --> 39:34.640
- [laughs]
- YOU SKI?

39:34.673 --> 39:36.808
- I'M LUCKY IF I CAN WALK.
NO, WE'RE--

39:36.842 --> 39:38.143
WE'RE HERE
FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

39:38.176 --> 39:41.112
- UH, STRICTLY AS FRIENDS.

39:43.549 --> 39:46.017
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.019
- THANKS.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.555
[stammering]
AND YOU--

39:49.588 --> 39:50.556
YOU HERE ALONE?

39:50.589 --> 39:52.090
- NO.

39:52.123 --> 39:53.525
- OH.

39:53.559 --> 39:55.761
- I'M WITH,
UH, 11 OTHER MEN.

39:55.794 --> 39:59.498
- [laughs]

39:59.531 --> 40:02.568
- WELL, YOU KNOW, I--
I ALWAYS PREFERRED THE--

40:02.601 --> 40:05.036
THE ONE-ON-ONE SPORTS.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.171
ALWAYS FOUND
THE ACTION MUCH MORE--

40:06.204 --> 40:09.174
- INTENSE?

40:09.207 --> 40:12.678
- FULFILLING.

40:15.747 --> 40:18.216
- WELL, I'LL, UH...

40:18.249 --> 40:20.452
CATCH YOU LATER.

40:20.486 --> 40:21.920
- UH, NO.
HEY, HEY.

40:21.953 --> 40:25.056
WHY NOT NOW?

40:25.090 --> 40:26.792
SERIOUSLY, GO ON.

40:26.825 --> 40:32.163
THAT WAY, I CAN HAVE
ALL THIS YUMMY CAKE TO MYSELF.

40:37.969 --> 40:41.239
- [chuckles]

40:41.272 --> 40:43.241
- THANKS, EM.

40:43.274 --> 40:49.447
[mixed chatter and laughter]

40:54.185 --> 40:56.888
- PARDON ME, BUT AREN'T YOU
EMMETT HONEYCUTT

40:56.922 --> 41:00.992
OF THE HAZELHURST,
MISSISSIPPI, HONEYCUTTS?

41:01.026 --> 41:04.029
- WHY, YES I AM.

41:04.062 --> 41:05.564
AND, UH, YOU ARE?

41:05.597 --> 41:07.633
- AH...

41:07.666 --> 41:10.101
- OH MY GOD.

41:10.135 --> 41:12.971
YOU'RE CALVIN CULPEPPER.
- YEP. [laughs]

41:13.004 --> 41:16.575
- YOU WERE ON THE BOYS'
SWIM TEAM IN HIGH SCHOOL.

41:16.608 --> 41:17.843
I USED TO GO TO THOSE MEETS

41:17.876 --> 41:20.746
JUST HOPING YOUR TRUNKS
WOULD SLIP OFF.

41:20.779 --> 41:23.048
- WELL, NOW...

41:23.081 --> 41:26.585
- BUT, UH, I ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU WERE, UM...

41:26.618 --> 41:28.920
- [whispers]
SO DID I.

41:28.954 --> 41:31.923
- HMM...

41:31.957 --> 41:33.759
SO, UH, WHAT DO YOU SAY

41:33.792 --> 41:37.128
WE GO BACK TO MY ROOM
AND, UH...

41:37.162 --> 41:38.730
REMINISCE ABOUT OLD TIMES?

41:38.764 --> 41:42.300
- THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH
TO REMINISCE ABOUT.

41:42.333 --> 41:46.271
- I KNOW.

41:46.304 --> 41:47.806
[baby cooing]

41:47.839 --> 41:49.541
- I LOVE YOU, HONEY BUN.

41:49.575 --> 41:52.678
- I HOPE EVERYBODY PEED.
[chuckles]

41:52.711 --> 41:54.646
WHENEVER I USED
TO TAKE MICHAEL ANYWHERE,

41:54.680 --> 41:56.181
NO SOONER WE'D LEAVE THE HOUSE
THAN HE'D SAY,

41:56.214 --> 41:59.017
"MA, I GOTTA TINKLE."
[laughter]

41:59.050 --> 42:00.619
AND I'D SAY, "WHY?
YOU COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT

42:00.652 --> 42:01.687
BEFORE YOU LEFT THE HOUSE?"

42:01.720 --> 42:02.854
- DO YOU MIND
IF WE NOT RELIVE

42:02.888 --> 42:04.222
THE GOLDEN DAYS
OF YESTERYEAR?

42:04.255 --> 42:05.791
- SO TO SPEAK.

42:05.824 --> 42:07.659
- DID YOU PUT AIR
IN THE TIRES?

42:07.693 --> 42:09.227
- MICHAEL, I JUST TOOK IT
TO THE GAS STATION.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.663
HE CHECKED THE TIRES,
THE WATER, THE OIL, THE BRAKES.

42:11.697 --> 42:14.032
- NEVER SEND A FAG
TO DO A DYKE'S WORK.

42:14.065 --> 42:16.968
- AND REMEMBER TO CALL
WHEN YOU ARRIVE.

42:17.002 --> 42:18.804
- WELL, HOW CAN WE FORGET
WHEN MICHAEL WILL BE CALLING US

42:18.837 --> 42:20.305
EVERY FIVE MINUTES
TO REMIND US?

42:20.338 --> 42:22.841
[laughter]

42:24.743 --> 42:26.812
- [sighs]
WELL, I GUESS IT'S TIME WE--

42:26.845 --> 42:28.313
- HOLD IT.

42:28.346 --> 42:29.848
I DON'T CARE
WHERE YOU'RE GOING

42:29.881 --> 42:31.249
AND I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

42:31.282 --> 42:33.051
BUT YOU BETTER
GET YOUR ASSES BACK HERE

42:33.084 --> 42:35.721
EVERY THANKSGIVING,
CHRISTMAS, 4th OF JULY,

42:35.754 --> 42:38.924
HANUKKAH, AND MOTHER'S DAY.

42:38.957 --> 42:42.728
'CAUSE YOU KNOW
HOW I FEEL ABOUT FAMILY.

42:42.761 --> 42:45.664
- WELL, WE WOULDN'T
BE ONE WITHOUT YOU, DEB.

42:45.697 --> 42:47.699
- [laughs]

42:50.301 --> 42:53.739
TAKE GOOD CARE
OF MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

42:57.776 --> 42:59.611
[laughs]
- MMM!

42:59.645 --> 43:00.612
- OH!

43:00.646 --> 43:01.980
[mixed chatter]

43:02.013 --> 43:03.081
I LOVE YOU.

43:03.114 --> 43:04.282
- WE'RE READY TO ROLL.

43:04.315 --> 43:05.951
- MEL.
- BRIAN.

43:05.984 --> 43:07.252
- DON'T YOU THINK
I'M NOT COMING UP THERE

43:07.285 --> 43:08.754
FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER'S
BIRTHDAY,

43:08.787 --> 43:12.624
SO YOU BETTER
MAKE ROOM.

43:18.396 --> 43:20.398
- YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT?

43:20.431 --> 43:23.869
- WITHOUT YOU
CWAZY WESBIANS?

43:23.902 --> 43:26.304
- I MEANT JUSTIN.

43:26.337 --> 43:29.040
- HE'S A SELFISH PRICK,

43:29.074 --> 43:31.242
THINKS ONLY OF HIMSELF.

43:31.276 --> 43:34.279
- YOU TAUGHT HIM WELL.
