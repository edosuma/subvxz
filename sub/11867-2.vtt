00:17.601 --> 00:19.057
LARRY: Fargo!

00:20.229 --> 00:21.389
Larry.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.229
First day with
the new boss, huh?

00:25.234 --> 00:26.815
And the new desk.

00:26.902 --> 00:28.438
Jealous much?

00:28.570 --> 00:31.403
Just because Blake
inherited you, doesn't mean
she has to keep you.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.439
Not if there's
a better candidate
for the job.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.907
The better candidate
already has the job.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.989
Oh, we'll see.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.700
This transition has
to go smoothly.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.742
The D.O.D. brass in town,
the computer reboot,

00:44.795 --> 00:47.207
lot of pressure
to perform, huh?

00:47.256 --> 00:49.087
No room for screw-ups.

00:50.259 --> 00:53.251
That shouldn't be
an issue for you,
should it?

01:03.063 --> 01:06.100
Hey! Midterms today,
right?

01:06.650 --> 01:08.436
Those were last week, Dad.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.851
Oh! Yeah, I know, the...

01:12.531 --> 01:14.988
You haven't told me
how you did yet.

01:15.701 --> 01:18.067
Oh, yeah, B,

01:18.120 --> 01:19.280
Uh-huh.
B plus,

01:19.371 --> 01:20.827
Uh-huh.
(QUIETLY) F,

01:20.956 --> 01:23.072
B minus, A.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.203
Well, A's great!

01:29.256 --> 01:33.420
Yeah, it's for PE.
You get it just for putting
on the stupid shorts.

01:33.468 --> 01:36.050
(STAMMERING)
And the F?

01:38.056 --> 01:40.172
The make-up exams are today,
so you can relax.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.132
I am relaxed, ljust...
Yeah.

01:42.227 --> 01:44.092
ldidn't even yell...
Which is killing you.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.052
Yeah, it really is.
But I got an F once,
and...

01:46.106 --> 01:47.562
Yeah. Eighth grade geometry.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.099
No time for story mode,
'cause we really need to go.

01:50.152 --> 01:51.483
Yeah, but, you know,
keep your nose...

01:51.570 --> 01:53.356
ZOE: Nose to the grindstone.
Don't get discouraged.

01:53.447 --> 01:58.191
Something about walking
three miles through broken
glass, uphill, both ways.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.276
And just keep trying!
Close enough?

02:05.584 --> 02:06.869
Did you get her anything?

02:06.918 --> 02:08.419
Get who anything?

02:08.503 --> 02:12.212
The woman you have a crush on
is becoming the most powerful
person in Eureka,

02:12.257 --> 02:13.918
so you might wanna get
her something.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.250
I don't have a crush
on anyone.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.008
SARAH, door!

02:18.055 --> 02:20.171
(DOOR OPENING)

02:23.685 --> 02:25.095
SARAH, door!

02:30.776 --> 02:32.391
Good morning, Doctor.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.059
GUARD: Dr. Blake.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.154
WOMAN: Miss Blake.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.207
MAN 1: Good morning,
Miss Blake.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.583
Dr. Blake.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.540
MAN 2: Miss Blake.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.500
Miss Blake.
Okay.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.585
What's with all the looks
and the "Miss Blakes"?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.417
l was Allison
until yesterday.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.094
And you're taking over
Global Dynamics today.

03:01.139 --> 03:03.255
Things are gonna
be different.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.429
Has General Mansfield
arrived yet?

03:10.524 --> 03:11.513
A few minutes ago.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.644
He wanted to personally
supervise the change
in command.

03:13.777 --> 03:14.983
And you'll handle
the biometric verification?

03:15.112 --> 03:16.352
And the retinal scan.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.822
Once you've replaced
Dr. Stark...

03:17.948 --> 03:19.609
Succeeded Dr. Stark.

03:19.616 --> 03:22.028
Once you're in charge,
Global's core
computer systems

03:22.119 --> 03:25.282
will immediately begin
the eight-hour reboot,
audit and reset.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.782
Everything
but external security

03:26.873 --> 03:29.831
and nominal
desktop functionality
will be offline.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.579
It's kind of like
a snow day.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.252
Normally it would have been
another six months
before we did the shutdown,

03:34.256 --> 03:36.668
but with the accident
in Section Five
and the transition,

03:36.758 --> 03:39.249
the DOD. decided
to move the date.

03:43.849 --> 03:45.089
Allison.

03:45.517 --> 03:46.757
Nathan.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.474
So, guess
I'll meet you inside.

03:53.442 --> 03:54.602
l was gonna call you
this morning...

03:54.651 --> 03:57.267
Hey, busy day. I get it.

03:58.613 --> 04:01.696
Again, I'm sorry about
the way things came down.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.068
Don't be.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.275
Wasn't your call.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.284
After you.

04:35.650 --> 04:39.017
Dr. Stark,
if you'd place your hand
on the scanning device.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.406
FARGO: And now
the retinal verification.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.824
Retinal scan
confirms a match.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.488
Miss Blake.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.415
FARGO: And a match
on Miss Blake.

05:01.718 --> 05:05.256
Dr. Stark, if you would
type in your master password
on the touch screen.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.718
And now by keying in
your own password,

05:12.771 --> 05:15.478
you'll become the new head
of Global Dynamics.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.772
Transfer's complete.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.313
Global's computer reset
will begin

05:25.951 --> 05:26.940
now!

05:29.579 --> 05:32.321
MALE VOICE ON P.A.:
Global Dynamics
computer shutdown

05:32.415 --> 05:38.376
in nine, eight,
seven, six, ﬁve,

05:38.421 --> 05:42.460
four, three, two, one.

05:48.098 --> 05:51.431
The Global Dynamics
computer system
is now offline.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.762
Eight hours to reactivation.

05:53.812 --> 05:57.430
The Global Dynamics
computer system
is now offline.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.643
Eight hours to reactivation.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.063
VICTOR: When the computer
does a shutdown like this,

06:03.113 --> 06:05.604
all operative projects
are suspended,

06:05.657 --> 06:09.525
all transportable prototypes
stored securely here
in the vault.

06:10.120 --> 06:14.284
There's an automatic inventory
as soon as the system
comes back online.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.789
Looks like
some of this stuff has
been here for a while.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.872
That's because we store
abandoned projects here
as well.

06:19.921 --> 06:23.914
We got our organic,
electronic, Al,
you name it.

06:24.009 --> 06:27.593
Yourjob will be to
make sure it all stays
safe and sound.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.593
You got some pretty
big shoes to fill.

06:29.681 --> 06:32.172
I got over 20 years
without a single loss.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.349
What's supposed
to be here?

06:43.862 --> 06:46.069
You have got to
be kidding me.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.445
NATHAN: Big improvement.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.458
It is missing
something though.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.115
What is that?

06:59.210 --> 07:03.499
Oh, a little parting gift.
My parting, not yours.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.261
Nathan, thank you.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.676
Now you're official.

07:15.268 --> 07:19.181
You don't have to leave,
you know. It's not like
you were fi red.

07:20.357 --> 07:23.224
I don't know, this place,
what it did to me...

07:24.694 --> 07:29.108
Gotta admit it's kind of nice
not having all this resting
on my shoulders.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.777
Was it really that bad?

07:32.202 --> 07:34.693
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

07:36.790 --> 07:40.533
VICTOR: Miss Blake,
I'm afraid there 's been
a breach in vault security.

07:40.585 --> 07:41.791
A theft.

07:42.212 --> 07:46.171
It’s a Category Red device.

07:47.509 --> 07:48.999
ALLISON: Fargo!

08:00.355 --> 08:02.596
(TOILET FLUSHING)

09:02.375 --> 09:03.364
Uh-oh.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.954
Oh, Sheriff Carter,
General Mansfield.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.739
Shenﬁ.
Hey, so, what do we got?

09:44.834 --> 09:47.917
A time warp? Black hole?
Random quantum...

09:48.963 --> 09:50.339
Not that that
ever happens.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.881
A prototype of a next-
generation M.A.C.A.A.
is missing from the vault.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.549
It's not a bird.

09:56.262 --> 10:00.255
It's a Multi-Application
Combat Armor Alternative.
M-A-C-A-A.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.553
Personal force field
generator.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.805
Oh! A personal force field!

10:07.482 --> 10:10.474
Do you have a picture
or something, so I know
what I'm looking for?

10:10.527 --> 10:11.607
Unfortunately, no.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.144
With the computers offline,
the only thing that I can
tell you

10:14.197 --> 10:16.153
is that it's
a Category Red.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.152
I assume red is bad?

10:18.243 --> 10:20.199
Red is catastrophic.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.242
Handled incorrectly,
a Category Red device could

10:22.330 --> 10:23.365
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

10:23.456 --> 10:25.868
take out
this entire facility.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.369

10:27.460 --> 10:29.075
It needs to be found.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.878
What are you doing?
Stop screwing around.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.627
I'm not screwing around.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.250
I'm just doing what we do.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.759
No more of that.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.300
Okay.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.388
I'll go find
your catastrophe.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.143
Thank you.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.892
Oh! Allison...

10:51.401 --> 10:52.481
Yes?

10:53.570 --> 10:55.902
Nice nameplate.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.947
It was a gift
from Nathan.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.608
Oh.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.902
You were gonna
say something?

11:03.955 --> 11:06.071

11:31.441 --> 11:33.102
Why?
I want to continue
Kim's research.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.223
I can't get her back.

11:34.277 --> 11:38.771
I can at least honor
her memory by finishing
what she started.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.610
And how do you feel
about science now?

11:43.661 --> 11:45.822
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.404
Well, you've been
pretty vocal about

11:47.457 --> 11:49.118
how you think
Eureka has lost its way.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.239
Oh.

11:50.293 --> 11:53.911
That noble ideas
have turned into
weapons of destruction.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.917
Science has failed you.

11:58.051 --> 12:01.293
And now, it's cost the life
of the woman you loved.

12:01.387 --> 12:04.595
Science hasn't failed me.
The approach to it has.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.472
And that's what
I want to change.

12:06.559 --> 12:10.017
Nathan Stark's experiences
made him want to leave
Global altogether.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.186
Yet, you want back in.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.935
Nathan and l are
very different people.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.438
I don't see how
his decision has
anything to do

12:17.528 --> 12:19.029
with my wanting
to get back to work.

12:19.113 --> 12:22.947
So you think you can put
this tragedy behind you.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.152
Never.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.070
But I can be
motivated by it.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.448
That's good.

12:33.336 --> 12:34.701
That's good.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.544
CARTER: Anything?
Nah.

12:38.424 --> 12:41.916
With the main computer
down, I can't access
any security footage.

12:42.011 --> 12:45.424
Did I mention I'm one day
away from retiring
with a perfect record?

12:45.473 --> 12:48.590
Twice, yeah. Look,
do you know who'd want one
of these force field things?

12:48.643 --> 12:50.429
Yeah! Me, right now!

12:50.478 --> 12:52.719
All right, Victor, think!

12:53.439 --> 12:55.179
Who was down here
this morning?

12:55.275 --> 12:57.015
I don't know.
A lot of people.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.941
This is the G.D.
storage vault!

12:58.987 --> 13:02.275
With the computer
about to shut down,
this was a busy place!

13:02.365 --> 13:04.105
Well, how about
someone new?

13:04.200 --> 13:05.906
You said you had a trainee?

13:05.952 --> 13:08.284
Yeah. But he got
here later.

13:10.081 --> 13:12.868
There was this
one guy though.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.784
Shifty, weaselly,
suspicious kind of guy.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.209

black-rimmed glasses?

13:20.258 --> 13:21.338

about an hour ago,
never came back.

LARRY: Not the best way
to impress your new boss.

13:44.198 --> 13:47.690
Looks like something
made an impression.
You gonna stick around?

Oh, I intend to.

off and take it back
to the vault right now!

I can't turn it off.
I can't open it up.
I can't drop it.

You probably don't
wanna do that...

Hardly catastrophic,
but very impressive!

15:22.088 --> 15:23.669
Except for the not-being-
able-to-turn-it—off part.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.579
Fargo, what are you
doing with that?

15:25.675 --> 15:28.291
Nothing. I've never seen
it before. I found it
in my pocket.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.675
But you did turn it on?

15:29.762 --> 15:31.377
Yeah.
Why?

15:32.473 --> 15:34.384
Because it's what I do.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.387
Ridiculous as this may sound,
I happen to believe him.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.639
I don't think that
anyone else would tend
to be that stupid.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.179
(CRASHING)
ALLISON: Agreed.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.480
FARGO: Sorry.

15:42.567 --> 15:43.773
Oh, why is this happening?

15:43.818 --> 15:47.060
It's pretty amazing. I mean,
you've only had the job for,
what, like an hour?

15:47.155 --> 15:48.190
FARGO: Actually,
an hour and...

15:48.281 --> 15:50.237
Okay, hey! I need
this thing turned off!

15:50.324 --> 15:51.359
Are you sure?
It'd be safer
for everybody...

15:51.451 --> 15:52.657
ALLISON: Okay, just please...
Just figure it out!

15:52.702 --> 15:55.318
CARTER: Okay, all we have
to do is we have to figure out
either who took it,

15:55.371 --> 15:57.657
or better yet,
who built it.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.241
Are you sure you don't know
anything about it?

16:02.295 --> 16:03.455
I wasn't here
when it was developed.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.005
Well, who was?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.002
Oh, crap!

16:11.596 --> 16:13.086
(HORN HONKING)

16:13.264 --> 16:14.720
Stark! Need your help.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.380
Carter! No.

16:16.434 --> 16:17.640
It's about Fargo.

16:18.561 --> 16:19.550
Fargo?

16:19.604 --> 16:22.767
Yeah, you know, glasses,
sort of accident-prone.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.100
Yeah, yeah,
what about him?

16:24.150 --> 16:27.813
Well, seems he got caught
in some sort of
a force field thingy.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.986
He got it from the vault
and he can't turn it off.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.733
You talking about
the M.A.C.A.A.?

16:31.782 --> 16:35.070
Not that coherently, but yes.
What do you know about it?

16:35.119 --> 16:37.735
I know that
it was Category Red
and it was terminated.

16:37.788 --> 16:40.780
Well, Fargo un-terminated it.
And we can't get
any information from Global

16:40.917 --> 16:42.953
because the computers
are down.
What do you know about it?

16:43.002 --> 16:45.084
Not a lot.
It's before my time.

16:45.129 --> 16:48.121
Do you know anyone
who was associated with it?

16:48.633 --> 16:49.793
Maybe.

16:54.305 --> 16:58.093
Wow. Someone's
gone a little overboard
on the firewood.

16:58.768 --> 17:01.305
Chopping wood can be
very therapeutic.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.931
You never swung
an axe in your life.

17:03.022 --> 17:06.264
l've swung a lot of things
that would surprise you,
Shenﬁ.

17:06.317 --> 17:08.273
What does that
even mean?

17:09.320 --> 17:10.901
There's Dr. Todd.

17:10.947 --> 17:11.936
Oh.

17:15.743 --> 17:17.358
CARTER: Dr. Todd?

17:18.621 --> 17:20.703
Don't get many visitors
up here.

17:20.790 --> 17:21.996
Well, we would
have called, but...

17:22.083 --> 17:25.120
I don't have a phone,
so I guess you didn't
take the hint.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.158
Well...

17:42.395 --> 17:44.181
I try my best not to
kill things anymore.

17:44.272 --> 17:48.140
Yeah. We need some information
about your M.A.C.A.A.?

17:48.234 --> 17:49.770
If I tell you
will you go away?

17:49.819 --> 17:52.026
(FIRES)
Well, we have
a situation...

17:52.113 --> 17:53.774
All right. Enough!

17:54.240 --> 17:57.403
Someone at G.D.
messed with it
and is in trouble.

17:57.451 --> 18:02.445
The M.A.C.A.A. was
my project five years ago,
until I stopped working on it.

18:02.540 --> 18:03.700
Because it had problems?

18:03.749 --> 18:05.535
Because a man died.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.038
We were having
containment issues
with the power source.

18:08.129 --> 18:09.960
Sometimes the power surged
and we couldn't stop it,

18:10.047 --> 18:13.539
and other times
the biological backup would
activate spontaneously

18:13.634 --> 18:16.046
and start drawing power
from the environment.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.336
But we thought we'd solved it
within the acceptable level
of tolerance.

18:18.389 --> 18:19.549
We thought it was safe.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.009
Well, what happened?

18:23.269 --> 18:24.725
We were wrong.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.931
The field around
the test subject
started to grow.

18:27.023 --> 18:31.437
After three hours
it was as big
as a house.

18:32.028 --> 18:35.737
Then we calculated that
after four hours,
it would never be contained.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.739
Would have taken out Global
and everything in it.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.070
It would have taken out
Eureka and everything in it.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.111
A force field growing
at that rate?

18:43.205 --> 18:44.741
It would have
displaced everything
in its path,

18:44.790 --> 18:47.702
towns, cities, nothing
would have stopped it.

18:48.544 --> 18:51.627
It's funny how four hours
can change your life.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.459
When you said you had
to contain it...

18:54.550 --> 18:59.510
We dropped it
and the man inside it
into Section 14,

19:00.514 --> 19:05.008
a two mile-deep pit
that we used to test
nuclear weapons in the '50s.

19:06.103 --> 19:09.436
And then we dropped in
a three-megaton bomb after it.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.983
That was my last day
at Global Dynamics
and my first day here.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.979
I'd like you to leave now.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.818
I'd like to get back
to my fishing.

19:19.950 --> 19:24.444
Dr. Todd,
I'm really sorry, but
we need some help here.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.951
We need you to tell us
what we can do.

19:28.793 --> 19:31.284
You can say goodbye
to your friend.

19:34.799 --> 19:35.959
Thanks.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.100
How long since Fargo
turned on the generator?

19:52.149 --> 19:54.686
Maybe two hours.

19:54.777 --> 19:57.769
Only leaves us two hours.
That's not a lot of time.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.444
You know, that experiment
was five years ago.

19:59.448 --> 20:03.532
You're telling me that Global
hasn't come up with anything
that can counter this?

20:05.621 --> 20:07.361
Drive me to Henry's.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.016
NATHAN:
Still can't let go, huh?

21:22.740 --> 21:23.946
Can you?

21:24.325 --> 21:27.613
It's why I'm leaving Global.
But I can't leave just yet.

21:27.661 --> 21:28.912
Why not?

21:29.330 --> 21:31.036
We got work to do.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.449
You get anything?

21:35.628 --> 21:38.791
Yeah. Hey, Fargo.

21:39.590 --> 21:44.004
You're gonna be okay,
just as long as the
force field doesn't grow.

21:52.561 --> 21:55.303
Oh, my God.
You can't stop it,
can you?

21:55.397 --> 21:58.810
Not yet.
But if we don't give up,
you can't either.

22:07.451 --> 22:10.238
I really have to go
to the bathroom.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.948
Of course you do.

22:12.957 --> 22:14.663
Do we have
any suspects yet?

22:14.750 --> 22:17.287
No. Unless you count
this long list of people
around here

22:17.336 --> 22:19.827
who find Fargo
as annoying as we do.

22:20.631 --> 22:22.963
Hey, that's not...
Yes, it is.

22:23.008 --> 22:27.798
It's not so much who
finds Fargo annoying as
who on this list stands

22:28.264 --> 22:29.754
to gain from
what happened.

22:29.807 --> 22:31.388
Like this guy.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.222
Hey, Larry.
Seen Fargo yet?

22:36.272 --> 22:37.887
Sure haven't.
Oh, well, l have.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.931
See, it seems that
somebody stole something
from the vault

22:39.984 --> 22:42.976
that's gotten him into
a whole lot of trouble.

22:43.904 --> 22:47.317
Trouble like maybe
he won't be able to return
to his job for a while?

22:47.408 --> 22:50.741
Trouble like the
person who did this
is gonna go to jail.

22:50.786 --> 22:53.243
How do you feel
aboutjail, Larry?

22:55.749 --> 22:58.126
Wait a minute,
you think that l...
Motive seems clear to me.

22:58.252 --> 23:00.914
You wanted this job,
he got it,
now you're here.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.079
Did the guy in
the vault say that
l was down there?

23:03.132 --> 23:05.464
A lot of people have
been down there.

23:05.551 --> 23:06.666
Well, I wasn't one of them.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.136
Check the logs.
I can't.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.883
Not for six hours.
Not until the computers
come back online.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.589
Well, that's convenient.
Yeah.

23:14.101 --> 23:15.932
It is, isn't it?

23:16.604 --> 23:18.765
I'm not even cleared
for that section.

23:18.856 --> 23:20.062
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

23:20.107 --> 23:22.223
Hold on,
we're not through.

23:22.276 --> 23:23.436
Carter.

23:23.485 --> 23:24.816
NA THAN: I think
I found something.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.986
I need you to bring Fargo
to Henry's garage.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.404
I'll be right there!
Have a lead?

23:29.825 --> 23:33.534
I'm not sure yet.
Got to go.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.075
He has an idea.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.285
So do I.

23:39.335 --> 23:43.669
Open Section 14,
authorize the transfer
of the nuclear device.

23:43.756 --> 23:44.962
These things take time.

23:45.007 --> 23:46.247
Not yet.

23:46.634 --> 23:48.716
Carter's never let me down.

24:00.356 --> 24:01.687
NATHAN:
You were right, Carter.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.891
Something has changed
since Dr. Todd first
tested the device.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.525
We developed
the next-generation

24:06.612 --> 24:10.070
non-lethal carbon nano-tube
antipersonnel weapon.

24:10.115 --> 24:13.107
I call it a goo gun.
It's for crowd control.

24:13.202 --> 24:14.942
lt fires an epoxy-like foam

24:15.037 --> 24:17.574
that sticks people
in their place until
they're collected later.

24:17.623 --> 24:20.865
At least that's what
the first generation could do.
This baby could stop a jeep.

24:20.918 --> 24:24.627
So I'm thinking
if we can cover Fargo's
force field with it,

24:24.713 --> 24:26.294
we may be able to
restrict its growth.

24:26.382 --> 24:27.713
Yeah, for how long?

24:27.758 --> 24:31.717
Hopefully long enough
for Global's computers
to come back online.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.347
Dr. Stark, are you smiling?

24:39.019 --> 24:40.429
Of course not!

24:41.438 --> 24:42.769
You ready?

24:43.607 --> 24:45.108
Does it matter?

25:12.886 --> 25:14.877
FARGO: I'm still alive
in case anyone's interested!

25:14.972 --> 25:16.382
Mission accomplished.

25:16.473 --> 25:18.634
Yeah, all we have to
do now is

25:19.935 --> 25:20.924
pray.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.139
What's happening?

25:23.272 --> 25:25.604
The force field is
still expanding.

25:27.109 --> 25:28.770
And I'm all out of ideas.

25:39.288 --> 25:40.949
(WATCH BEEPS)

25:41.040 --> 25:44.157
ALLISON: The fact that Henry
and Nathan together came
up dry, not encouraging.

25:44.293 --> 25:45.282
I know. I'm gonna need
to take a look

25:45.377 --> 25:47.117
at the hard-copy backup
of the vault inventory.

25:47.212 --> 25:50.625
Why?
Well, I...
Just a hunch.

25:50.716 --> 25:51.956
But I think it might not
be an accident

25:52.009 --> 25:55.126
that the theft occurred
when the computers were down.

25:55.137 --> 25:56.126
Carter, I know
that you're trying,

25:56.221 --> 25:57.836
but I think you need
to prepare yourself.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.213
For what?
For what's coming.

25:59.308 --> 26:01.765
Time is running out
for Fargo, for Global...

26:01.810 --> 26:03.220
For you.

26:04.354 --> 26:06.219
What are you implying?

26:06.523 --> 26:07.808
Nothing.

26:07.858 --> 26:10.315
Forget it, ljust...
Just you seem different today.

26:10.402 --> 26:13.189
Yeah, well, I am different.
Part of the job description.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.986
Yeah, well, I'm not.

26:15.824 --> 26:19.237
But like you said,
we're running out
of time, so...

26:19.328 --> 26:21.159
Carter, I'm having Fargo
moved to Section 14.

26:21.246 --> 26:22.827
What? Wait a minute.
It's just precautionary,

26:22.873 --> 26:25.330
but under the circumstances
I don't have a choice.

26:26.335 --> 26:28.291
Look, if you want
the hard copy,

26:28.337 --> 26:30.328
the records are located
in Section Three,

26:30.422 --> 26:32.413
along with every other
record from the history
of Global,

26:32.508 --> 26:35.591
and, Carter,
the record section is big.

26:36.470 --> 26:37.459
How big are we talking?

26:42.768 --> 26:43.883
(ECHOING) Big.

27:05.290 --> 27:09.750
Well, it's not that bad.
Just hang in there.

27:10.587 --> 27:12.293
Easy for you to say.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.964
I know where we are.
I know what Section 14 is.

we have that's big enough
to hold you.

doing, Fargo?

Oh, I've been better.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.737
Allison thought that
you might wanna talk.

27:42.786 --> 27:46.654
Right, bring the psychiatrist
in to hear the dead guy's
last words.

27:46.748 --> 27:47.828
I didn't say that.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.326
You didn't have to.

27:51.962 --> 27:53.793
You know, I do
have some last words.

27:53.922 --> 27:56.413
Some things I wanna
get off my chest.

27:56.466 --> 27:58.593
Good. I'm listening.

27:58.635 --> 28:02.503
Well, you better get a pad.
There's gonna be a lot
to write down.

How are you holding up?

28:04.057 --> 28:05.638
ALLISON: I'm not the one
to worry about.

28:05.726 --> 28:09.139
I can worry about you both.
Is the nuke on the way?

28:09.229 --> 28:10.560
Not yet.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.267
Does Fargo know?

28:12.357 --> 28:13.938
Not yet.

28:13.984 --> 28:17.101
We have 30 minutes.
Carter is working
on something.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.187
And if that doesn't
pan out?

28:19.281 --> 28:21.647
Half an hour,
I'll have no choice.

28:22.910 --> 28:24.650
Hell of a first day.

28:25.287 --> 28:26.618
(SIGHS)

28:26.705 --> 28:28.115
Yes, it is.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.331
FARGO:
E-mail to Allison Blake.

28:31.793 --> 28:35.126
"You are the most intoxicating
woman I ever met.

28:35.214 --> 28:38.672
"| used to dream of you
catching me asleep
on your desk late at night."

28:38.759 --> 28:43.799
Send one of those to Jo
and substitute "jail cell"
for "desk."

28:43.847 --> 28:47.385
Oh, and send one to yourself
substituting "couch."

28:48.018 --> 28:51.306
And see if you can work
the word "tempestuous"
in there.

28:52.439 --> 28:53.554
Okay.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.139
Now, Sheriff Carter.

28:57.486 --> 28:59.772
"You really tried to
help me on my last day

28:59.863 --> 29:03.105
"and for that I don't know
how to thank you."

29:04.618 --> 29:05.733
That's actually
quite touching...

29:05.786 --> 29:08.027
"If only you were better
at your job."

29:13.543 --> 29:16.626
CARTER: Victor! Leaving
a little early today,
aren't you?

29:16.713 --> 29:19.546
About half an hour ahead
of your regular schedule?

29:19.591 --> 29:22.879
What are you talking about?
What do you know
about my regular schedule?

29:22.970 --> 29:24.255
A lot.

29:24.304 --> 29:26.545
We know a lot about
everything you do, Victor.

29:26.598 --> 29:30.136
Jo and | just spent a little
quality time looking through
your vault records.

29:31.144 --> 29:34.887
You didn't know we
could do that with
the computers down, huh?

29:35.732 --> 29:37.688
You wanna do the honors?

29:41.947 --> 29:43.938
JO: Move! Coming through!

29:47.619 --> 29:49.280
Clear the way!

30:00.132 --> 30:01.542
It's okay.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.584
CARTER: All right, Victor.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.093
Here it is.

30:07.889 --> 30:09.925
You not only stole
the generator,

30:09.975 --> 30:12.717
you stole a lot of stuff
from the vault.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.136
And you knew
you were safe until
the computer reboot

30:15.230 --> 30:16.686
forced the next
vault inventory.

30:16.773 --> 30:20.766
Once you found out that
they were gonna shut down
the computers early,

30:20.861 --> 30:22.442
you knew you had to
find someone to frame.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.030
And who better
than Douglas Fargo?

30:24.072 --> 30:25.061
l have no idea
what you're...

30:25.115 --> 30:27.276
We'll have all the proof
we need once the computers
come back online.

30:27.367 --> 30:29.358
But by then
a man will be dead.

30:29.411 --> 30:32.198
And that” be your fault
and that's murder!

30:32.622 --> 30:35.864
If you talk then
it'll be too late for you
and too late for Fargo.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.532
He wasn't supposed
to turn it on.

30:37.627 --> 30:40.289
Well, it's Fargo!
Of course he turned it on!

30:40.380 --> 30:41.711
Who's buying the
stolen equipment?

30:41.798 --> 30:44.050
Who wanted the
force field generator?

30:44.134 --> 30:46.716
I don't...
I need to know who
paid you to steal it!

30:46.762 --> 30:49.048
Do they know
how to turn it off?

30:49.097 --> 30:50.553
Oh, you don't understand.

30:50.599 --> 30:53.636
I didn't sell the technology.
| just sold the parts.

30:53.727 --> 30:56.389
I picked something
that would fit
in Fargo's pocket.

30:56.438 --> 31:00.351
I never intended to sell it.
| just needed a fall guy.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.935
What are we gonna do now?

31:13.705 --> 31:15.115
Yes, this is Allison Blake.

31:17.459 --> 31:20.951
l'm authorizing
a Priority One mobilization.
Section 14.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.661
Yes, that's right.

31:23.465 --> 31:24.955
Bring in the nuclear device.

31:59.793 --> 32:01.784
MANSFIELD: Allison, can I have
a word with you, please?

32:02.754 --> 32:04.164
You're cutting this
awfully close.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.626
We're trying to save
a life. Rushing things
isn't going to help.

32:06.675 --> 32:10.008
This is the kind of decision
someone in your position
has to be prepared to make.

32:10.053 --> 32:13.136
I'm aware of that, and
questioning my approach
doesn't make it any easier.

32:13.181 --> 32:15.342
It's not about easy,
Allison.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.800
It's about having faith
you made the right choice.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.265
Do you have faith?

32:59.311 --> 33:03.429
You did everything
you could.
More than anybody else.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.394
Not that it matters.
Fargo's still gonna die.

33:07.068 --> 33:09.650
Four hours really
can change your life.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.401
You're right. It...

33:14.451 --> 33:16.612
Fargo activated
the generator
four hours ago.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.576
Dr. Todd said that
after three hours

33:18.622 --> 33:21.455
the force field was
as big as a house.

33:21.583 --> 33:22.789
lt's nowhere near that big.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.917
NATHAN: lt's growing
more slowly.
The power supply is unstable.

33:25.962 --> 33:27.418
Maybe it was the way
it was handled.

33:27.464 --> 33:28.954
Or stored.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.967
lt sat right here
for five years until today.

33:34.095 --> 33:35.084
HENRY: Could have been
touching this.

33:35.138 --> 33:36.594
NATHAN:
Yeah, whatever this is.

33:36.640 --> 33:39.097
Well, this could be
the answer, but without
access to the computer...

33:39.142 --> 33:41.599
Jo has the inventory.
We got it from Section Three
this afternoon.

33:41.645 --> 33:44.637
But we still can't compare
the growth rate of the field
to the original experiment.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.975
All that data is
in the computer.

33:47.984 --> 33:49.565
And one other place.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.605
Dr. Todd, do not zap me
with that thing.

33:55.742 --> 33:58.233
I guess I wasn't clear about
not wanting any visitors.

34:00.622 --> 34:01.862
Well, I still wanna
be left alone now

34:01.957 --> 34:03.572
and you're still
bothering me now, so...

34:03.625 --> 34:07.038
The force field is different.
It's growing more slowly.

34:07.128 --> 34:10.336
It's been four hours
and Fargo still fits
in Section 14.

34:10.423 --> 34:12.630
And if it's slowed down
then maybe it can be stopped.

34:12.676 --> 34:14.291
Let us take you
back to Global.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.259
Help us figure this out.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.086
There's nothing I can do.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.470
NATHAN: Dr. Todd!

34:19.558 --> 34:23.142
Your device was stored
next to another prototype
that created a magnetic field.

34:23.228 --> 34:25.594
Was there a possibility of
some sort of power drain?

34:25.647 --> 34:28.309
Look at the specs.
Check the test records.

34:28.358 --> 34:30.644
We don't have the specs.
We have you.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.646
I know how you feel.
Believe me.

34:36.950 --> 34:40.613
We both made mistakes
at Global. Lost people
who trusted us.

34:40.704 --> 34:44.117
But today we got
a chance to try
and make things right.

34:49.296 --> 34:51.161
CARTER: Henry.
How long has it been?

34:51.256 --> 34:52.371
ALLISON: Five hours.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.717
You're right.
Something's slowing
the field's growth rate.

34:54.801 --> 34:55.836
Dr. Todd, Henry Deacon.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.463
I assume you're generating
a magnetic field?

34:57.512 --> 35:00.219
Generating the field
isn't the hard part. It's
the modulation that's tricky.

35:00.307 --> 35:02.798
Do you wanna check
my readings?
Please.

35:02.892 --> 35:04.473
I never thought
I'd say the phrase

35:04.561 --> 35:07.052
"Last chance" so many times
in a single day.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.811
MANSFIELD: Allison.

35:09.482 --> 35:11.473
Why has he not been
lowered into Section 14?

35:11.568 --> 35:13.183
Sir, we're exploring
one final alternative.

35:13.278 --> 35:16.520
You have missed the cutoff.
There was a firm
deadline in place.

35:16.573 --> 35:17.779
I'm aware of that.

35:17.866 --> 35:21.859
You are risking this
entire facility and
everyone in it on one man.

35:21.953 --> 35:26.037
That is not a logical choice.
That is an emotional one.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.704
And if you do not reconsider,

35:30.754 --> 35:34.087
I will have no choice
but to remove you as head
of Global Dynamics.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.591
Actually, sir,

35:39.304 --> 35:40.965
I'm afraid
you can't do that.

35:41.056 --> 35:42.136
I beg your pardon?

35:42.223 --> 35:44.805
Protocol states
that no transfer of power
or relief of duty

35:44.893 --> 35:47.805
can be effected
when the Global computer
systems are down.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.887
Security concerns.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.477
So, you can't fire me
for another three hours.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.687
You do understand that
once that force field

35:58.782 --> 36:00.397
gets to be too large
to leave this facility,

36:00.450 --> 36:02.611
it will also be too large
to fit into that hole.

36:02.661 --> 36:05.448
And at that point,
containment will be
out of the question.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.783
Let's hope that doesn't
have to happen, sir.

36:11.628 --> 36:13.209
(SIGHS)

36:14.464 --> 36:16.796
I think I'm starting
to like the new you.

36:18.802 --> 36:20.793
FARGO: Hey! lt's shrinking!

36:23.682 --> 36:25.218
Look, the lights fading.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.799
He's right.
The field is contracting.

36:28.395 --> 36:31.011
Mag-field's affecting
the power source.

36:32.816 --> 36:34.807
Wait. The lights out.

36:37.654 --> 36:39.940
Then why is the
force field still there?

36:42.283 --> 36:45.116
Wait. Now there's
a red light.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.364
TODD: The alternate power
source has been activated.

36:47.455 --> 36:48.615
How?

36:49.124 --> 36:50.785
I told you it draws power
from the environment.

36:50.792 --> 36:52.953
Well, what environment?
I mean, there's no one
in there but Fargo.

36:53.002 --> 36:55.789
Exactly.
lt's biological power.
His body is the power source.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.667
Well, so fine. The field
is shrinking which means
that we can use the computers

36:58.800 --> 37:00.131
when they get back online.
No, you
don't understand.

37:00.135 --> 37:01.375
The power requirement
is tremendous.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.380
And finding the source
is the default priority.

37:03.471 --> 37:04.506
Which means?

37:04.597 --> 37:06.133
It'll kill him.

37:06.516 --> 37:08.177
So what do we do?

37:10.729 --> 37:13.186
We're not gonna let
that thing kill Fargo.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.522
I'm gonna kill him first.

37:23.450 --> 37:25.486
So, Fargo's the battery
that's powering
the force field, right?

37:25.577 --> 37:27.067
Essentially.
So in order to collapse it,

37:27.162 --> 37:29.744
we need to shut
that battery down.

37:29.831 --> 37:31.571
What?
Well, just for a second.

37:31.666 --> 37:33.167
Well, how?
Nothing can get
through the field.

37:33.209 --> 37:35.416
Well, we can hear him, right?

37:36.421 --> 37:37.911
lt'll pack quite a punch.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.668
The sonic pulse will target
the area just like a bullet.

37:40.717 --> 37:43.754
We hit Fargo's heart,
it will stop.

37:43.845 --> 37:45.801
You're gonna what?
Is the defibrillator ready?

37:45.847 --> 37:47.758
Ready to go.
All right.

37:50.226 --> 37:52.217
Let's do this.
JO: Hold on!

37:53.354 --> 37:56.312
Now, I am the one with
the most marksmanship titles
in Special Forces history.

37:56.357 --> 37:58.222
Right. Good point.
Yeah.

38:03.323 --> 38:04.438
(STUTTERS)

I'm ready or when...

38:12.749 --> 38:14.239
(GASPING)

38:28.181 --> 38:29.341
Clear!

38:33.812 --> 38:34.927
No.

38:36.773 --> 38:38.309
ALLISON: Ready?

38:41.319 --> 38:42.479
Clear!

38:45.782 --> 38:47.238
Okay, just...

38:58.253 --> 38:59.789
Come on, Fargo.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.791
(FARGO COUGHS)

39:07.387 --> 39:08.502
Fargo!
Ow!

39:10.974 --> 39:12.464
You all right?

39:13.142 --> 39:14.928
Who ripped my shirt?

39:17.063 --> 39:18.394
He's fine.

39:21.442 --> 39:23.023
Good job, Carter.

39:24.404 --> 39:27.237
Wow, that didn't even
leave a bad taste
in my mouth.

39:27.282 --> 39:29.113
Oh, give it a second.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.115
Yup, there it is.

39:34.122 --> 39:35.453
Thanks, Dr. Stark.

39:35.540 --> 39:38.077
I feel closer to you
than I ever have before.

39:38.126 --> 39:40.617
Well, no good deed
goes unpunished.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.043
Seriously.

39:43.131 --> 39:47.044
What you and Sheriff Carter
did was a miracle.

39:47.135 --> 39:49.217
No, we just didn't give up.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.548
No one did.

39:55.351 --> 39:57.182
Thanks for killing me.

39:58.813 --> 40:00.098
Any time.

40:00.523 --> 40:03.139
If you happen to get
an e-mail from me...

40:03.234 --> 40:05.611
Yup. I already did.

40:05.653 --> 40:06.642
Oh.

40:12.952 --> 40:14.283
Done here?
Mmm-hmm.

40:20.293 --> 40:22.124
I'm glad I was wrong.

40:42.482 --> 40:46.316
I hear there's
a two-for-one deal
at Colossusjobs.com,

40:46.361 --> 40:49.148
if you wanna get your
resume up with mine.

40:49.197 --> 40:52.280
I think I'm safe here
at least for another day.

40:54.410 --> 40:56.116
You did good today.

40:56.579 --> 40:58.786
Handled the situation
better than I would have.

40:58.873 --> 41:02.457
Not better, just...
Just differently.

41:06.214 --> 41:09.547
Nathan, Global needs you.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.632
I need you.

41:13.054 --> 41:14.214
Really?

41:15.890 --> 41:17.926
And Carter's right.
The two of you do
work well together.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.718
Oh, you just know
how to ruin a moment.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.885
Just think about it.

41:23.940 --> 41:27.603
Well, maybe you should
think about how well
you and | work together.

41:28.403 --> 41:30.234
You have a lot of faith
in yourself.

41:30.321 --> 41:31.401
I do.

41:34.742 --> 41:36.027
Me, too.

41:38.287 --> 41:42.576
MALE VOICE ON P.A.: Attention.

systems are now back online.

41:42.625 --> 41:45.207

41:49.966 --> 41:53.083
SARAH: Good evening,
Sheriff Carter.
Hard day at work?

41:53.136 --> 41:55.092
They've been easier.

42:11.571 --> 42:12.811
ZOE: Hey, Dad.

42:12.822 --> 42:13.902
Hey.

42:14.657 --> 42:16.613
Catch any bad guys today?

42:16.659 --> 42:19.116
Yeah, as a matter
of fact I did.

42:19.162 --> 42:21.448
How was the make-up exam?

42:22.290 --> 42:24.622
Well, you know,
you're always saying,
"Try, try again"?

42:24.625 --> 42:26.957
Yeah, well, never
more than today.

42:26.961 --> 42:29.452
Well, I did.
And I passed.

42:29.547 --> 42:30.627

You are now looking
at the proud graduate

42:35.970 --> 42:38.507
So when you wanna
take me out driving?
