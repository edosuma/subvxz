00:01.042 --> 00:06.292
(light ethereal music)
(wine splashing)

00:09.542 --> 00:12.625
(glasses clinking)

00:12.625 --> 00:17.833
(alarm blaring)
(static buzzing)

00:20.583 --> 00:25.792
(light dramatic music)
(glassware clinking)

00:41.542 --> 00:44.458
(chains rattling)

01:05.125 --> 01:08.083
(chains rattling)

01:10.292 --> 01:13.417
(light eerie music)

01:21.708 --> 01:23.583
- You know I'm
worried about you.

01:24.833 --> 01:26.792
You barely eat, I hardly see you

01:26.792 --> 01:28.500
when you aren't in
that room working.

01:28.500 --> 01:31.000
- I'm fine, all right?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.958
Look, I'm sorry if I've
come across distant

01:32.958 --> 01:34.792
or whatnot lately, but
I feel like I'm really

01:34.792 --> 01:36.250
getting somewhere
with this work.

01:36.250 --> 01:38.500
I don't wanna stop, not now.

01:39.417 --> 01:40.708
I am so close.

01:46.917 --> 01:49.792
(Peter slurping)

01:54.000 --> 01:56.667
(phone ringing)

01:57.750 --> 01:58.750
- Dr. Linda Rowe.

02:01.667 --> 02:02.542
Yes.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.000
Right.

02:07.625 --> 02:10.042
Okay, sure.

02:10.042 --> 02:10.958
No problem.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.208
See you there.

02:15.875 --> 02:16.750
I gotta go.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.333
Shouldn't take more
than a couple hours.

02:20.333 --> 02:23.083
- I didn't realize
you were on call.

02:23.083 --> 02:24.292
- [Linda] Don't wait up.

02:36.167 --> 02:39.000
(door thudding)

02:47.875 --> 02:49.500
(chair scraping)

02:49.500 --> 02:52.333
(ominous music)

03:14.500 --> 03:17.625
(suspenseful music)

03:18.958 --> 03:21.667
(bell dinging)

03:24.625 --> 03:27.292
(ominous music)

03:41.292 --> 03:44.667
(light dramatic music)

03:47.917 --> 03:50.667
(gun clicking)

03:52.375 --> 03:55.333
(mutant growling)

03:59.333 --> 04:02.458
(suspenseful music)

04:05.958 --> 04:07.583
- Oh, Christ.

04:07.583 --> 04:08.625
How did you get out?

04:09.750 --> 04:12.625
(mutant growling)

04:13.833 --> 04:15.167
No, come on now.

04:17.582 --> 04:18.457
You see?

04:20.707 --> 04:22.707
There's nothing to worry about.

04:22.707 --> 04:23.625
No harm.

04:25.750 --> 04:28.707
(mutant grunting)

04:31.875 --> 04:34.292
Come on, remember your home.

04:37.332 --> 04:41.000
(mutant squealing)
(Peter groaning)

04:41.000 --> 04:46.207
(flesh squishing)
(Peter screaming)

04:48.417 --> 04:51.375
(gunshot banging)

04:52.375 --> 04:55.875
(fist thudding)

04:55.875 --> 04:57.957
(flesh squishing)
(Peter groaning)

04:57.957 --> 05:01.000
(mutant growling)

05:01.000 --> 05:03.833
(Peter groaning)

05:03.833 --> 05:09.042
(mutant grumbling)
(Peter screaming)

05:09.667 --> 05:10.667
(flesh squishing)

05:10.667 --> 05:13.458
(Peter gasping)

05:15.042 --> 05:18.375
(suspenseful music)

05:21.250 --> 05:22.125
(mutant growling)

05:22.125 --> 05:25.042
(dramatic music)

05:29.957 --> 05:32.292
- You sure you don't
want me to help you out?

05:32.292 --> 05:35.082
- I've got it, thank you.

05:35.082 --> 05:37.957
- You know, Jenna, you
don't have to leave so soon.

05:37.957 --> 05:41.667
I could, I could setup the
guest bedroom and we could-

05:41.667 --> 05:42.667
- We can what?

05:42.667 --> 05:44.917
Go back to being happy families?

05:46.082 --> 05:48.750
- Things don't have to
be like this, Jenna.

05:48.750 --> 05:49.957
- I'm sorry, all right, I am.

05:49.957 --> 05:52.292
But I'm not sorry
for what I did.

05:52.292 --> 05:53.957
- [Alan] All right,
stop, stop, just-

05:53.957 --> 05:56.500
- Some people just aren't
destined for one another.

05:58.667 --> 06:03.375
- Look, I agree, but without
giving something a proper go,

06:03.375 --> 06:05.125
I mean we can't, we
can't really comment

06:05.125 --> 06:07.000
that on our relationship.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.333
- We did give it a go, Alan.

06:09.333 --> 06:11.375
One hell of a go.

06:11.375 --> 06:14.167
We just aren't right
for each other.

06:14.167 --> 06:15.792
Look, I'm gonna load up the car.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.042
I'll be back for the rest
of my stuff tomorrow.

06:22.292 --> 06:25.542
(door thudding)

06:25.542 --> 06:28.582
(gravel crunching)

06:36.417 --> 06:39.582
(car doors slamming)

06:41.707 --> 06:42.625
- You okay?

06:43.750 --> 06:45.375
- What, oh, I'm sorry.

06:45.375 --> 06:49.792
I didn't exactly get
much sleep last night.

06:49.792 --> 06:51.292
- Yeah, I can see that.

06:52.625 --> 06:53.832
Do you wanna go home?

06:53.832 --> 06:56.250
You still have that
holiday you barely used.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.917
- No, no, no, I could,

06:59.207 --> 07:01.833
I could use the
distraction if I'm honest.

07:01.833 --> 07:02.708
- The wife?

07:04.250 --> 07:05.250
- Ex-wife.

07:06.458 --> 07:08.625
I guess I should get
used to saying that.

07:08.625 --> 07:10.833
- Is she really
backing out on you?

07:10.833 --> 07:12.708
- Says we're not meant to be.

07:14.375 --> 07:15.875
Which is probably
partially true,

07:15.875 --> 07:20.625
but I don't know how she got
to that conclusion so fast

07:20.625 --> 07:23.000
'cause everything was
fine until I found out.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.332
And then, bam.

07:26.542 --> 07:28.000
Her mind was all made up.

07:29.167 --> 07:31.250
- Yeah, well, how
fine can you really be

07:31.250 --> 07:33.167
if she was playing
those games, huh?

07:34.207 --> 07:36.125
Anyway, this might distract you.

07:41.042 --> 07:42.000
- Hello, Marsh.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.542
They're waiting over there.

07:45.667 --> 07:48.792
(light eerie music)

07:59.957 --> 08:01.708
- Oh, Captain Norton.

08:01.708 --> 08:03.083
This is zoologist Alan Marsh

08:03.083 --> 08:05.583
and his assistant, Julie Larkin.

08:05.583 --> 08:07.083
- We got body, male.

08:07.083 --> 08:09.875
Wife arrived home early in
the morning and found him.

08:09.875 --> 08:11.208
Claims she was at work.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.333
Claims she doesn't
know what coulda

08:13.333 --> 08:14.750
done this to her husband.

08:15.958 --> 08:18.042
- What do you mean
what coulda done this?

08:18.042 --> 08:20.582
- Well, we're not really
sure, but we don't think

08:20.582 --> 08:22.707
this murder was committed
by another human.

08:24.332 --> 08:26.917
- So, what are you
saying did this?

08:28.625 --> 08:29.875
- We don't know.

08:29.875 --> 08:32.542
That's what we're hoping
you can help us with.

08:32.542 --> 08:33.832
McKenna, would you mind?

08:33.832 --> 08:36.375
- Miss Larkin, Marsh,
hi, thanks for coming.

08:36.375 --> 08:38.332
Sorry to throw you both
in the deep end like this,

08:38.332 --> 08:41.082
but we need an opinion.

08:41.082 --> 08:42.207
Come with me.
- Sure.

08:52.792 --> 08:55.917
(suspenseful music)

09:10.667 --> 09:12.208
- Jesus Christ.

09:12.208 --> 09:13.500
- Chambers, take
Miss Larkin outside

09:13.500 --> 09:14.917
for some fresh air, will you?

09:20.250 --> 09:22.583
- What are you thinking
coulda done this?

09:23.792 --> 09:24.500
- A bear?

09:26.292 --> 09:27.292
A big wild cat?

09:29.167 --> 09:30.250
Christ knows.

09:36.375 --> 09:39.958
- A bear so close
to the city, no.

09:42.542 --> 09:44.167
And this attack
happened indoors,

09:44.167 --> 09:47.000
that would be very
outta character.

09:48.917 --> 09:50.833
Big cats don't really
come near humans

09:50.833 --> 09:52.458
unless they feel threatened, so.

09:54.292 --> 09:57.167
Oh, God, no, this was
something completely different.

09:58.458 --> 10:01.583
- Do you have any idea
what might've done this?

10:03.667 --> 10:05.125
- I'll need to take some samples

10:05.125 --> 10:07.708
if that's okay with you boys.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.875
- Do what needs to be done.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.125
McKenna'll stay with ya.

10:12.125 --> 10:14.333
- Appreciate it.

10:14.333 --> 10:17.708
(light dramatic music)

10:27.500 --> 10:29.542
- You essentially listen.
- Uh huh.

10:29.542 --> 10:31.667
- We'll do all the talking.

10:31.667 --> 10:33.875
Just make a mental
note of anything

10:33.875 --> 10:35.792
she says that might
spark a thought.

10:37.125 --> 10:39.250
Has she seen any wild
animals in the area recently

10:39.250 --> 10:43.083
or any idea what
might've done this.

10:43.083 --> 10:45.083
All right?

10:45.083 --> 10:48.292
- Yeah, I gotcha.
(sirens wailing)

10:52.958 --> 10:55.708
(somber music)

11:10.958 --> 11:14.458
- Dr. Linda Rowe, I'm
Captain Edwardo Norton.

11:14.458 --> 11:16.667
This is Detective James McKenna.

11:16.667 --> 11:18.917
And with us today, we also
have specialist zoologist,

11:18.917 --> 11:21.750
Alan Marsh, who's helping
us with the investigation.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.875
- Hi.

11:24.875 --> 11:26.375
- Thank you for waiting here.

11:26.375 --> 11:30.375
I wish we were meeting under
better circumstances, Dr. Rowe.

11:30.375 --> 11:31.542
How are you holding up?

11:33.708 --> 11:35.375
- Call me Linda.

11:35.375 --> 11:38.833
- Okay, Linda, we're gonna
have to ask you some questions.

11:38.833 --> 11:40.875
Are you ready and
comfortable to begin?

11:42.042 --> 11:42.875
- Sure.

11:44.167 --> 11:46.792
- I have written down
here you arrived home

11:46.792 --> 11:48.833
in the early hours
of the morning.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.250
- I'm a doctor, I was on call.

11:54.083 --> 11:58.250
Usually I don't get called
out, but last night I was.

11:59.542 --> 12:00.833
- That was lucky for you.

12:03.542 --> 12:04.750
- Excuse him.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.750
So, can you tell me what
happened when you arrived home.

12:12.083 --> 12:17.125
- I got home, everything
seemed normal.

12:20.708 --> 12:25.917
I walked in and I knew
something was off.

12:28.500 --> 12:33.583
The lights had been left
on and he never did that.

12:35.833 --> 12:40.208
He was a in bed by
midnight kinda guy,

12:40.208 --> 12:44.167
and he wouldn't leave the
lights on while sleeping.

12:45.333 --> 12:46.750
- Was there anything
strange outside

12:46.750 --> 12:48.958
the house before you went in?

12:48.958 --> 12:49.833
- Nothing.

12:51.792 --> 12:53.708
That was what was so strange.

12:56.625 --> 12:57.375
I froze.

12:59.083 --> 13:01.958
(Linda sneezes)

13:12.917 --> 13:14.583
I had to get them to check it

13:14.583 --> 13:16.625
was actually him
because I couldn't

13:16.625 --> 13:18.792
believe he's really gone.

13:18.792 --> 13:21.583
(Linda crying)

13:27.417 --> 13:30.208
(Linda sneezes)

13:35.542 --> 13:36.417
Thank you.

13:45.083 --> 13:47.333
- Marsh here is gonna
take some samples

13:47.333 --> 13:48.958
from your clothing, Dr. Rowe.

13:50.375 --> 13:51.333
You okay with that?

13:52.375 --> 13:53.292
- Sure.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.167
- Here's my card.

13:56.417 --> 13:57.667
Don't be afraid to just call me

13:57.667 --> 14:00.583
if you can think
of anything, okay?

14:03.625 --> 14:06.958
(light dramatic music)

14:25.333 --> 14:26.667
- What are you thinking?

14:27.792 --> 14:30.292
- She's clearly in shock.

14:30.292 --> 14:33.208
Whatever was in the
house she has no clue.

14:33.208 --> 14:36.000
But she's clearly had
some kinda reaction to it.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.417
- What do you mean?

14:37.417 --> 14:39.250
- Well, she was
sneezing profusely.

14:39.250 --> 14:42.042
And she hasn't washed since
discovering her husband,

14:42.042 --> 14:46.542
so I'm guessing whatever it
was has rubbed off on her skin,

14:46.542 --> 14:48.583
her hair, and most
likely her clothing.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.333
So, I'll get the
swabs off to the lab

14:50.333 --> 14:53.583
and let you boys know asap
exactly what's going on.

14:53.583 --> 14:56.042
I'm assuming you're gonna
ask her for clothing too?

14:56.042 --> 14:59.042
- We'll be taking swabs and
a lamination from the prints.

15:00.958 --> 15:03.042
- I'm not sure everything
she's revealing

15:03.042 --> 15:04.208
is the entire truth.

15:05.583 --> 15:07.750
- Why do you say that?
- The files of her husband,

15:07.750 --> 15:11.625
they was all tampered
with or gone missing.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.625
She's hiding something.

15:16.625 --> 15:19.292
(ominous music)

15:31.875 --> 15:33.167
- These fucking heels.

15:37.042 --> 15:39.917
(trash thudding)

15:39.917 --> 15:45.125
(rats squeaking)
(suspenseful music)

15:56.125 --> 15:58.417
(woman gasps)

15:58.417 --> 15:59.375
Just a rat.

16:01.083 --> 16:03.750
(eerie music)

16:10.833 --> 16:13.792
(mutant growling)

16:20.750 --> 16:23.875
(suspenseful music)

16:29.042 --> 16:32.125
(trash bin rattling)

16:32.125 --> 16:36.917
(heel snapping)
(woman groaning)

16:36.917 --> 16:42.042
(mutant growling)
(woman groaning)

16:43.708 --> 16:47.917
(mutant shrieking)
(woman coughing)

16:47.917 --> 16:50.750
(woman gasping)

16:51.958 --> 16:55.000
(mutant shrieking)

16:56.000 --> 17:01.208
(woman groaning)
(metal clanking)

17:03.250 --> 17:06.541
(mutant growling)

17:06.541 --> 17:08.208
(suspenseful music)

17:08.208 --> 17:09.500
(woman gasps)

17:09.500 --> 17:10.458
(mutant grunting)
(flesh squishing)

17:10.458 --> 17:13.500
(woman groaning)

17:13.500 --> 17:16.458
(woman screaming)

17:17.666 --> 17:20.333
(phone buzzing)

17:27.250 --> 17:28.541
- Alan speaking.

17:28.541 --> 17:32.208
- [Linda] Hi, it's
Linda, Dr. Rowe.

17:32.208 --> 17:34.375
I hope you don't mind,
I got your number

17:34.375 --> 17:36.583
from the officer or
Detective McKenna.

17:39.167 --> 17:42.000
I found something that you
might wanna take a look at.

17:43.333 --> 17:44.667
Do you mind coming over?

17:46.250 --> 17:48.833
(Alan sighs)

17:51.458 --> 17:55.083
(light switch clicking)

18:01.458 --> 18:04.083
(door thudding)

18:08.125 --> 18:10.458
- [Alan] God damn.

18:10.458 --> 18:12.792
- I'm sorry for calling
so out of the blue.

18:14.917 --> 18:17.292
I was just in this
big old house alone.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.833
- Why didn't you ask the
officers to come with you?

18:22.833 --> 18:25.958
- What, Captain Norton
and Detective McKenna?

18:27.833 --> 18:30.667
Not exactly the
comforting type, are they?

18:32.042 --> 18:34.792
- No, I suppose not.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.583
- Anyway, when I came back

18:39.583 --> 18:43.208
I started looking around
and I found these.

18:49.917 --> 18:51.792
You know they think
I was in on it.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.042
I can sense it.

18:55.417 --> 18:57.833
The way they worded their
questions towards me.

19:02.250 --> 19:06.208
I found these in the workspace.

19:06.208 --> 19:08.083
I was never allowed
in here before.

19:09.333 --> 19:10.958
I found them in
there stashed away.

19:15.833 --> 19:21.042
- You know, you should
be showing these to
the cops, not me.

19:23.583 --> 19:25.375
- I wanted a second opinion.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.792
Before I take this further.

19:32.292 --> 19:33.542
- This paper looks new.

19:39.583 --> 19:40.875
So you seriously had no idea

19:40.875 --> 19:42.875
what he was up to
here in his lab?

19:44.083 --> 19:46.292
- I knew he was
trialing some drugs.

19:48.167 --> 19:53.250
After he got made redundant,
he really believed in the work

19:53.250 --> 19:56.625
he was doing and he didn't
wanna give up on it.

19:57.917 --> 20:00.667
He had the money to
get by month-by-month

20:00.667 --> 20:05.333
and it was something he
was so passionate about.

20:05.333 --> 20:08.792
I thought, what
the hell, you know?

20:08.792 --> 20:11.208
As long as we can pay the bills.

20:13.500 --> 20:18.708
- These uh, these packets
here on the table,

20:19.542 --> 20:21.583
he's mixing medicines.

20:23.917 --> 20:29.125
Growth hormone, 19-Nor-5,
androstenedione, Dianabol,

20:33.333 --> 20:37.333
and uranium isotopes.

20:38.375 --> 20:40.333
- Sorry, I get the first part.

20:40.333 --> 20:43.792
Uranium what?
- It's uranium-235.

20:45.375 --> 20:48.333
- So, it's radioactive?

20:50.042 --> 20:52.125
- You never asked him specifics?

20:53.167 --> 20:54.708
(Linda sighs)
Geez.

20:54.708 --> 20:57.042
- I let him tell me what
he wanted to tell me.

20:58.875 --> 21:01.417
I knew he tested on
generics in here,

21:01.417 --> 21:04.042
you know, mice, rats, rabbits.

21:05.208 --> 21:09.250
He was trialing a
drug which hopefully

21:09.250 --> 21:11.750
some of these papers can
shed some light onto.

21:15.125 --> 21:18.042
- You didn't know your
husband so well, huh?

21:18.042 --> 21:20.333
- You only know what
people will let you see.

21:25.708 --> 21:28.167
(fire crackling)

21:28.167 --> 21:31.458
(light dramatic music)

21:44.333 --> 21:46.250
I should ask before pouring.

21:46.250 --> 21:47.542
Gin?

21:47.542 --> 21:48.875
- I'll take it straight.

21:54.167 --> 21:56.000
This your mom?

21:56.000 --> 21:56.917
- Yeah.

21:59.125 --> 22:01.417
Yeah, that's my mom
a few years back.

22:10.375 --> 22:13.292
- You know, you
got the same eyes.

22:13.292 --> 22:14.208
- Thank you.

22:15.583 --> 22:17.042
People used to say that.

22:20.375 --> 22:22.250
- I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

22:25.167 --> 22:29.042
- You know, she would
usually be the one

22:29.042 --> 22:31.083
I would call in a
situation like this.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.958
(Linda sighs)

22:34.958 --> 22:40.167
Like this, I mean, whoever
is in a situation like this?

22:44.458 --> 22:47.083
I picked up my phone earlier
and I looked who to call

22:49.625 --> 22:50.667
and there was no one.

22:53.292 --> 22:55.667
I couldn't think of a
single person to call.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.167
(Linda chuckling)

22:58.167 --> 23:00.333
How'd I get like this, huh?

23:04.833 --> 23:06.167
- You know, your husband must've

23:06.167 --> 23:07.375
had something else up there.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.042
From the markings I saw, it
had to be something at least,

23:13.042 --> 23:14.958
at least his size if not double.

23:16.208 --> 23:17.125
- You think so?

23:22.167 --> 23:23.250
I will work with you.

23:24.250 --> 23:26.333
I wanna help if you'll let me.

23:28.792 --> 23:30.708
I wanna find out what my
husband was working on

23:30.708 --> 23:34.750
out there and I wanna
find out what killed him.

23:38.792 --> 23:43.958
And then, I wanna take the
son of a bitch out myself.

23:49.542 --> 23:50.750
I will work with you.

23:50.750 --> 23:52.708
I will tell you what
you need to know

23:54.167 --> 23:55.417
if you help me get to it.

23:58.458 --> 23:59.292
- All right.

24:00.500 --> 24:01.708
You got yourself a deal.

24:02.792 --> 24:04.042
Off the record of course.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.417
- I'll raise a toast to that.

24:21.333 --> 24:22.583
Top up?

24:22.583 --> 24:23.958
- You know, if I keep
drinking like this,

24:23.958 --> 24:25.917
I won't be able to
drive myself home.

24:26.875 --> 24:28.292
- I have a couch.

24:28.292 --> 24:30.208
You're welcome to
crash if you need.

24:32.083 --> 24:32.958
- Top it up.

24:36.583 --> 24:37.500
Thank you.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.208
- So, tell me, where's
the wedding ring?

24:44.833 --> 24:45.625
- I'm sorry?

24:46.667 --> 24:49.792
- Well, yesterday when I
met you at the station,

24:49.792 --> 24:51.250
you had a ring on your finger.

24:52.167 --> 24:53.042
Now, it's gone.

24:54.500 --> 24:59.000
So, either you decided to
hide that fact when you got

24:59.000 --> 25:01.958
the call to come over or
there's something else.

25:04.375 --> 25:05.250
- Wow.

25:06.333 --> 25:08.208
It's a bit of both.

25:09.667 --> 25:10.542
- Explain.

25:12.208 --> 25:13.125
- I'm...

25:16.708 --> 25:19.792
I'm going through a bit of
a nasty divorce right now,

25:19.792 --> 25:24.500
and I didn't really
want that on show

25:24.500 --> 25:26.792
or to be the topic
of conversation.

25:28.583 --> 25:31.375
- How'd you even know it
would be a potential topic?

25:34.542 --> 25:35.417
- Is it not?

25:37.083 --> 25:40.833
- Well, I invited you
over here to help out

25:40.833 --> 25:44.167
on a case and to figure
out what's going on.

25:44.167 --> 25:49.375
- Hm and (clinking) gin is
an essential part of that.

25:50.375 --> 25:51.250
Isn't it?

25:53.625 --> 25:54.542
- You're good.

25:58.667 --> 25:59.917
You really think
that you'll find out

25:59.917 --> 26:01.833
what did this to my husband?

26:06.000 --> 26:07.292
- 100%.

26:07.292 --> 26:11.000
Look, whatever is out
there, I'll find it.

26:18.917 --> 26:21.333
(traffic humming)

26:21.333 --> 26:23.042
- [Chambers] This
is Suzanne Wright.

26:23.042 --> 26:25.875
She was found in the early
hours of the morning.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.125
The neighbors called
it in when they heard

26:27.125 --> 26:29.208
a commotion around
the back of the flat.

26:30.167 --> 26:31.333
Our boys went in and they

26:31.333 --> 26:34.000
found her body
completely mutilated.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.375
- Uh, where is the location?

26:35.375 --> 26:37.250
- A side street by the club.

26:39.417 --> 26:40.875
- So, it's gaining confidence.

26:40.875 --> 26:42.500
It's ventured into the city.

26:42.500 --> 26:43.708
- It seems so, yeah.

26:45.458 --> 26:49.083
The same abrasions we found on
the first victim, Peter Rowe.

26:49.083 --> 26:52.125
Any results back yet on the
clothing from the first scene?

26:52.125 --> 26:55.792
Do we have any ideas yet
what kind of animal this is?

26:55.792 --> 26:57.208
- No, I don't have my
results back either,

26:57.208 --> 27:00.792
but I mean from these abrasions,

27:00.792 --> 27:05.958
it's apparent to be
some kinda rodent.

27:05.958 --> 27:06.833
- A rodent?

27:08.708 --> 27:09.958
- I mean, last night she did say

27:09.958 --> 27:12.583
he was working on
mice and rats, but-

27:12.583 --> 27:14.125
- Who?

27:14.125 --> 27:16.208
- Linda Rowe, she
told me her husband

27:16.208 --> 27:18.833
had been testing
something up in his lab

27:18.833 --> 27:21.542
and was taking mice and
rats up there to test

27:21.542 --> 27:24.000
whatever drug concoction
he was coming up with.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.583
- What the hell were you doing
with Linda Rowe last night?

27:27.583 --> 27:28.500
- She called me.

27:29.875 --> 27:31.750
She didn't wanna be alone and
she wanted to help somehow.

27:31.750 --> 27:34.417
- And how the hell did
she get your number?

27:34.417 --> 27:35.875
- Sir, I just
thought it would be-

27:35.875 --> 27:38.167
- You and I will talk later.

27:39.750 --> 27:42.917
We can't have people helping
investigating this crime

27:42.917 --> 27:45.458
getting involved with the
victim's bereaved wife.

27:46.417 --> 27:48.375
It's not professional.

27:48.375 --> 27:51.292
And if you screw this
up, I'll feed your balls

27:51.292 --> 27:53.625
to those animals you
study in the goddamn zoo.

27:55.417 --> 27:57.583
- Look, she didn't call you

27:57.583 --> 27:58.833
'cause she didn't
think you'd listen.

27:58.833 --> 28:01.625
And you know what, I
kinda see her point.

28:01.625 --> 28:02.917
Now, look, I'm here
to help you out

28:02.917 --> 28:04.292
and if you wanna keep me here,
I wouldn't start by throwing

28:04.292 --> 28:05.958
around your little
empty threats.

28:07.333 --> 28:11.000
As for my personal life,
none of your business.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.333
- He made something
up in his lab?

28:13.333 --> 28:14.750
- He made something for sure.

28:15.750 --> 28:18.792
As for what, that's the problem.

28:18.792 --> 28:20.542
Right now, everything is
kinda pointing towards

28:20.542 --> 28:22.708
it being some kind
of mutated rodent,

28:22.708 --> 28:24.625
but I don't even wanna say that.

28:24.625 --> 28:25.500
I mean, (sighs).

28:27.208 --> 28:30.083
I mean, it defies all logic,
it defies all evolution.

28:31.375 --> 28:32.625
Right now, (stuttering),

28:32.625 --> 28:34.167
I can't say exactly
what it is right now.

28:34.167 --> 28:35.375
It's just-

28:35.375 --> 28:37.167
- You're saying some
mutated creature

28:37.167 --> 28:38.500
is walking these streets?

28:40.458 --> 28:41.958
- Quite possibly.

28:41.958 --> 28:42.875
- [Norton] Damn.

28:44.083 --> 28:46.125
Were there reporters
at the crime scene?

28:46.125 --> 28:47.833
- Press office is
dealing with it now, sir.

28:47.833 --> 28:49.875
It's hitting the
news as we speak.

28:50.917 --> 28:53.125
- Look, whatever this thing is,

28:53.125 --> 28:56.292
it's clearly feeding
once a day minimum.

28:56.292 --> 28:57.667
So, we gotta put the
city on lockdown.

28:57.667 --> 28:59.750
Keep everybody safe
until we can find it.

28:59.750 --> 29:01.500
- Lockdown?

29:01.500 --> 29:02.792
Are you crazy?

29:02.792 --> 29:05.250
You can't put the city
on lockdown for this.

29:05.250 --> 29:07.583
We don't even know
what the hell this is.

29:08.917 --> 29:11.583
Look, we think it's
killed two people,

29:11.583 --> 29:13.083
but we have no forensic evidence

29:13.083 --> 29:15.667
linking them together as of yet.

29:15.667 --> 29:19.125
Hell, we have no evidence of
anything right now except some

29:19.125 --> 29:22.458
half-assed theory of a potential
serial giant rat killer.

29:23.542 --> 29:25.667
The press will have a field day.

29:29.333 --> 29:32.750
The public needs to
be warned, officially.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Only Christ knows
what we can tell them.

29:40.875 --> 29:44.208
(light dramatic music)

29:48.542 --> 29:51.375
(keys jingling)

29:55.292 --> 29:57.917
- [Julie] What is
it about this woman?

29:57.917 --> 29:59.542
- I'm just gonna go warn her.

30:00.833 --> 30:02.625
- Alan, I know you
better than that.

30:04.125 --> 30:05.792
- Julie, that is all.

30:08.958 --> 30:10.208
- Do you really think
it's a good idea

30:10.208 --> 30:12.250
to be hitting on
a grieving widow?

30:12.250 --> 30:13.792
(Alan scoffs)

30:13.792 --> 30:15.750
- Look, there's a major
difference between me warning

30:15.750 --> 30:19.083
somebody and taking them out
for a candlelit dinner, okay?

30:19.083 --> 30:20.542
I'm gonna be two seconds.

30:21.792 --> 30:24.750
(door creaking)
(ominous music)

30:24.750 --> 30:25.667
Linda?

30:30.250 --> 30:31.208
Linda, you home?

30:32.667 --> 30:35.375
(eerie music)

30:42.625 --> 30:45.667
(ceiling thudding)

30:48.917 --> 30:51.750
(phone ringing)

30:55.042 --> 30:57.458
- [Linda] Alan, hi, it's Linda.

30:57.458 --> 30:59.125
I'm down at the station.

30:59.125 --> 31:01.042
They said you went
to check in on me.

31:03.292 --> 31:04.667
- Yeah, I'm in your house.

31:06.042 --> 31:09.583
- [Linda] Oh, sorry, I
left a little while back.

31:09.583 --> 31:10.875
I was asked to go
down to the station

31:10.875 --> 31:12.500
for some further questioning.

31:13.708 --> 31:16.083
- Yeah, I think there's
something in your house.

31:18.208 --> 31:20.208
- [Linda] What?

31:20.208 --> 31:23.625
(eerie music continues)

31:39.875 --> 31:42.083
- Yeah, I think it's come back.

31:43.125 --> 31:46.250
(suspenseful music)

31:59.125 --> 32:00.542
(light dramatic music)

32:00.542 --> 32:01.250
Fuck it.

32:06.375 --> 32:09.458
(suspenseful music)

32:17.000 --> 32:19.875
(dramatic music)

32:22.167 --> 32:24.125
(Alan groaning)

32:24.125 --> 32:26.667
(mutant growling)
(flesh ripping)

32:26.667 --> 32:31.875
(foot thudding)
(Alan groaning)

32:33.083 --> 32:38.292
(Alan grunting)
(mutant groaning)

32:40.500 --> 32:43.708
(flesh squishing)
(Alan groaning)

32:43.708 --> 32:45.083
(suspenseful music)
(door slamming)

32:45.083 --> 32:46.542
- [Linda] Alan!

32:47.625 --> 32:50.875
(Alan panting)

32:50.875 --> 32:52.250
- It's in there, it's in there.

32:52.250 --> 32:53.875
Come on.

32:53.875 --> 32:55.958
Come on, get in the car.

33:00.375 --> 33:04.417
- So, you're saying the thing

33:04.417 --> 33:09.625
that attacked you
was a giant rat?

33:10.792 --> 33:12.083
- Look, I know how
this sounds, all right?

33:12.083 --> 33:14.083
But that thing, it
was more mutated.

33:15.458 --> 33:18.333
It was the size of a
frickin' bear, I...

33:18.333 --> 33:20.667
God knows how it got that big.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.333
- Whatever he was playing with,

33:22.333 --> 33:24.500
concocting in his
little room, it got out.

33:26.750 --> 33:29.958
- We got the results back.
(light dramatic music)

33:29.958 --> 33:33.458
From Linda's clothing
and the first victim.

33:33.458 --> 33:34.833
It's definitely rodent fur.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.833
It must've rubbed off
from her husband's body

33:38.833 --> 33:40.875
and that's why she
had that reaction.

33:42.333 --> 33:45.333
- The biggest question is
why did it go back there?

33:45.333 --> 33:48.417
- Maybe it associates
it with its home.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.417
Which isn't necessarily
a bad thing.

33:50.417 --> 33:55.625
I mean, at least we know it
isn't in the sewers of the city.

33:56.958 --> 33:58.042
- And where do you
suppose this creature goes

33:58.042 --> 34:00.333
when it's not at its home?

34:00.333 --> 34:02.792
- God knows, where
do rats dwell?

34:02.792 --> 34:06.125
Sewers, dark alleys, dumpsters?

34:07.417 --> 34:09.125
- Something the city is full of.

34:10.792 --> 34:13.375
- I need to update the
chief on this latest.

34:14.583 --> 34:15.583
(Norton sighs)

34:15.583 --> 34:17.833
Christ, this is all we need.

34:19.625 --> 34:20.750
- Look, this is a rat.

34:22.167 --> 34:23.875
One larger in size,
I'll grant you that,

34:23.875 --> 34:26.125
but it's still a rat.

34:26.125 --> 34:28.042
And it's a once in a
lifetime opportunity

34:28.042 --> 34:29.333
to deal with
something like this.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.708
I've never encountered
anything like this.

34:31.708 --> 34:34.500
I wanna find out what Peter
Rowe was trying to achieve,

34:34.500 --> 34:36.667
how it got this big.

34:36.667 --> 34:38.625
We should treat this like
we would any other case;

34:38.625 --> 34:41.042
we trap it and then we study it.

34:41.042 --> 34:42.875
- What if you're wrong?

34:42.875 --> 34:45.708
What if it becomes
uncontrollable and
more people die?

34:45.708 --> 34:48.958
- Look, if we act fast,
this won't be a situation.

34:49.875 --> 34:52.208
- 24 hours, that's all we have.

34:52.208 --> 34:53.917
We track this fucker down,

34:53.917 --> 34:55.667
we figure out how
to take it down,

34:55.667 --> 34:58.125
we capture it and we end this.

34:59.167 --> 35:00.167
And it's all yours.

35:04.208 --> 35:05.875
A word, Alan, before I leave.

35:15.333 --> 35:18.042
(Alan groaning)

35:18.042 --> 35:19.917
What is going on?

35:19.917 --> 35:21.083
- I'm sorry?

35:21.083 --> 35:22.625
- Your little assistant told me,

35:22.625 --> 35:25.708
so I know you're going
through a hard time at home.

35:25.708 --> 35:27.375
But jumping onto
the next best thing

35:27.375 --> 35:30.458
is not gonna resolve your
mental state, all right?

35:30.458 --> 35:34.125
I warned you about getting
involved with the wife.

35:34.125 --> 35:36.708
You need to be
focused right now.

35:36.708 --> 35:38.208
I need your attention.

35:38.208 --> 35:41.292
You're the expert that's gonna
help us capture this thing.

35:42.917 --> 35:45.542
Now, I can get my firearms
officers to shoot it dead,

35:45.542 --> 35:47.750
but you want it alive.

35:47.750 --> 35:49.458
So, in that case,

35:49.458 --> 35:51.542
buck yourself up and just
stay away from the wife.

35:51.542 --> 35:53.750
- I told you, there's
nothing going on.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.375
- Let her grieve.

35:56.208 --> 35:57.583
(Alan sighs)
Understood?

35:59.042 --> 36:01.875
She could still be a suspect.
- Yeah.

36:01.875 --> 36:03.458
I hear ya.

36:03.458 --> 36:05.000
- We'll see you first thing.

36:10.583 --> 36:11.667
McKenna.
(eerie music)

36:11.667 --> 36:13.833
- Sir?
- Come on, we're off.

36:22.500 --> 36:23.250
- Hey.

36:25.167 --> 36:27.042
Everything okay?

36:27.042 --> 36:29.542
(Alan chuckling)

36:29.542 --> 36:31.167
I'm sorry for turning up.

36:33.375 --> 36:35.875
I just wanted to
check you were okay.

36:35.875 --> 36:37.333
I heard about the attack.

36:38.792 --> 36:41.292
- I'm fine, really, it's
just a few scratches.

36:42.833 --> 36:44.750
- I was scared to
go back to the house

36:44.750 --> 36:46.833
after they told me
that thing was there.

36:48.042 --> 36:49.958
They told me I
should be cautious.

36:56.708 --> 36:59.333
He can't stop us
from having a drink.

36:59.333 --> 37:01.833
That's not affecting
anything, surely.

37:03.375 --> 37:06.583
- I guess I should go by
what he says while I'm still

37:08.958 --> 37:10.958
hired and assisting the case.

37:15.125 --> 37:18.208
- So, how come you
went by my place today?

37:18.208 --> 37:21.583
- Uh, I, uh, just wanted,

37:23.250 --> 37:24.750
just wanted to
warn you, ya know?

37:24.750 --> 37:27.750
There's a huge mutant
rat running around.

37:27.750 --> 37:31.583
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right, you know?

37:34.208 --> 37:35.250
- I appreciate that.

37:37.125 --> 37:38.042
Thank you.

37:41.167 --> 37:45.375
- So, you thought about where
you're gonna wait this out?

37:48.083 --> 37:50.625
- I'll probably just
go back to the hotel

37:50.625 --> 37:53.042
that I stayed in after Peter.

37:53.042 --> 37:56.833
You know, when they were
examining the house.

37:59.708 --> 38:02.000
- No siblings or-

38:02.000 --> 38:03.375
- No siblings.
- Oh.

38:04.500 --> 38:06.250
- There's an aunt of Peter's,

38:06.250 --> 38:09.167
but she doesn't really
have the space for me.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.292
And I need to kinda
stay close by for work.

38:14.417 --> 38:19.375
- Ah, so um, so how
long you been a doctor?

38:20.583 --> 38:21.958
- Coming up to my fifth year.

38:23.167 --> 38:24.583
I'm a late starter.

38:26.083 --> 38:27.750
I started off as a nurse

38:27.750 --> 38:30.917
and then I studied
and became a doctor.

38:33.250 --> 38:35.042
I wanted something fulfilling.

38:35.958 --> 38:38.833
You know, and after my mom,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.083
I wanted to figure out
something I could do

38:43.083 --> 38:46.000
that could stop others from
going through what she did.

38:49.458 --> 38:51.250
And you, a zoologist.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.500
What exactly does that entail?

38:57.792 --> 39:03.208
- Well, we specialize in
multiple areas of animal care.

39:03.917 --> 39:05.375
Anything from animal welfare

39:05.375 --> 39:10.125
to controlling
pests and diseases.

39:10.125 --> 39:14.167
My team and I mainly
focus on drug development.

39:15.292 --> 39:17.250
We make drugs to help animals,

39:17.250 --> 39:19.708
whether it be by stopping
the spread of diseases

39:19.708 --> 39:23.417
or from stopping them from
contracting it themselves.

39:24.833 --> 39:26.833
I started the business when
I just got sick of working

39:26.833 --> 39:30.875
for my old boss and then
hired Julie as my assistant,

39:30.875 --> 39:34.542
and I just haven't
looked back since.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.875
(Linda sighs)

39:39.875 --> 39:42.458
- You know, if I keep drinking,

39:45.667 --> 39:47.375
I won't be suitable to drive.

39:48.292 --> 39:51.667
(light dramatic music)

39:55.667 --> 39:56.833
So, I should probably quit while

39:56.833 --> 39:59.750
I'm ahead and go
check into the hotel.

40:19.083 --> 40:22.708
- It's looking like
it's gonna cost you.

40:22.708 --> 40:23.583
- Okay.

40:24.792 --> 40:27.000
- You don't look surprised.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
- Well, do any cars pass
their inspections, huh?

40:30.000 --> 40:32.042
(mechanic scoffs)

40:32.042 --> 40:34.750
Hm, sorry, how long
is this gonna take?

40:34.750 --> 40:36.500
'Cause I've got places to be.

40:39.417 --> 40:42.958
- Right, I'll go finish it now.

40:44.042 --> 40:46.167
- Great.
- There's the papers.

40:47.917 --> 40:50.333
Copy machine is
ready when you are.

40:50.333 --> 40:51.458
- [Woman] Mm.

40:53.917 --> 40:57.083
(ominous music)

40:57.083 --> 40:58.042
- Stuck up bitch.

41:01.917 --> 41:05.042
(suspenseful music)

41:19.000 --> 41:21.750
(metal clanking)

41:23.875 --> 41:27.000
(suspenseful music)

41:54.083 --> 41:56.792
(woman sighs)

41:58.792 --> 42:04.000
(suspenseful music)
(rats squeaking)

42:13.542 --> 42:14.458
(dramatic music)

42:14.458 --> 42:17.458
(mutant growling)

42:25.417 --> 42:28.917
(light dramatic music)

42:32.292 --> 42:33.167
- Hello?

42:40.333 --> 42:41.333
Hey, mister.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.792
(door slamming)

42:53.000 --> 42:55.333
Look, I don't have time
to be waiting all day.

43:00.542 --> 43:05.750
(dramatic music)
(woman groaning)

43:06.583 --> 43:07.958
(suspenseful music)

43:07.958 --> 43:13.167
(mutant growling)
(flesh squishing)

43:19.333 --> 43:22.333
(woman screaming)

43:25.958 --> 43:28.917
(mutant growling)

43:31.542 --> 43:33.375
(metal bins clanking)

43:33.375 --> 43:38.250
(woman panting)
(mutant growling)

43:38.250 --> 43:43.458
(flesh squishing)
(woman screaming)

43:44.667 --> 43:48.625
(hammer thudding)
(mutant screeching)

43:48.625 --> 43:50.833
(mutant growling)
(flesh squishing)

43:50.833 --> 43:53.792
(woman screaming)

44:04.458 --> 44:07.417
(mutant roaring)

44:10.958 --> 44:13.792
(phone ringing)

44:16.083 --> 44:17.000
- Alan speaking.

44:19.625 --> 44:20.750
All right, yeah.

44:20.750 --> 44:22.667
I'm on my way, I'm on my way.

44:24.833 --> 44:27.292
(Alan sighs)

44:28.167 --> 44:29.083
When?

44:30.417 --> 44:31.500
When did this happen?

44:32.625 --> 44:34.500
- The late hours of the night.

44:34.500 --> 44:37.417
Seemed she had someone
checking out her car.

44:37.417 --> 44:39.958
The rat got up probably
from the sewers below,

44:39.958 --> 44:42.583
attacked the workman
and then attacked her.

44:44.625 --> 44:46.292
- Anyone else around?

44:46.292 --> 44:48.000
- Yeah, it was pretty quiet.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.125
Although it does look like
the creature had attempted

44:50.125 --> 44:51.667
to get into some
of the other homes.

44:51.667 --> 44:53.583
- Goddammit, stop calling
this thing a creature!

44:53.583 --> 44:56.125
I told you it's a rat,
it's a frickin' rat!

44:56.125 --> 44:57.375
All right?

44:57.375 --> 44:58.958
And you shoulda
put warnings out!

44:58.958 --> 45:00.917
The public don't even know
what's out there amongst them.

45:00.917 --> 45:02.667
All right, if you
had put warnings out,

45:02.667 --> 45:04.667
maybe people would've
stayed fucking indoors!

45:04.667 --> 45:06.167
- It isn't that easy.

45:06.167 --> 45:08.167
We have to weigh up the factors.

45:08.167 --> 45:09.792
Scaring the public into feeling

45:09.792 --> 45:12.125
they aren't safe is not the way.

45:12.125 --> 45:14.125
It's last case scenario.

45:14.125 --> 45:16.625
The public's response is
what we need to control

45:16.625 --> 45:18.750
in order to get
ahold of this thing.

45:18.750 --> 45:21.708
This is no different to
any other serial killings,

45:21.708 --> 45:23.583
except it's not human.

45:23.583 --> 45:26.333
- Yeah, you're doing
a great job so far.

45:26.333 --> 45:28.542
- Whatever actions that
coulda taken place,

45:28.542 --> 45:30.167
it got into the garage.

45:30.167 --> 45:32.708
There really isn't much
to have prevented that.

45:38.417 --> 45:39.625
The body count's rising.

45:41.250 --> 45:43.208
Christ, this thing
could attack again.

45:44.667 --> 45:47.250
We need to get someone else in.

45:47.250 --> 45:48.625
- I'm not leaving this case.

45:49.875 --> 45:53.750
- Look, it's out of our hands.

45:53.750 --> 45:55.667
We need to get the FBI in.

45:55.667 --> 45:57.708
So, we just wanna thank you for

45:57.708 --> 45:59.250
all the work you've done so far.

46:03.125 --> 46:04.667
- I'm so sorry, Alan.

46:06.083 --> 46:09.708
Look, what you need
to do now is to focus

46:09.708 --> 46:13.958
all of your energy onto finding
that thing and ending this.

46:13.958 --> 46:16.625
You can't listen to them.

46:16.625 --> 46:18.250
- I have no intention
of doing so.

46:18.250 --> 46:19.125
Thank you.

46:20.708 --> 46:23.000
Those guys have no idea
what they are dealing with.

46:24.417 --> 46:25.625
They didn't see that thing.
They didn't look in its eyes.

46:25.625 --> 46:27.667
They didn't see its face.

46:27.667 --> 46:31.208
That thing is angry
and it is hungry.

46:31.208 --> 46:33.875
Whatever your husband
created, it is pissed off.

46:39.500 --> 46:40.542
We gotta trap it.

46:43.083 --> 46:44.292
- What do you mean?

46:44.292 --> 46:46.875
- It'll go back to the house.

46:46.875 --> 46:49.917
It obviously sees it as
some kind of safe place,

46:51.208 --> 46:52.292
so we go back there.

46:54.125 --> 46:55.750
And when it returns,
we're ready.

46:57.792 --> 46:58.792
- We wait it out?

47:00.333 --> 47:01.083
- Exactly.

47:02.625 --> 47:03.542
- Okay.

47:05.917 --> 47:11.125
- All right, all right.
(light dramatic music)

47:13.417 --> 47:16.542
(suspenseful music)

47:24.000 --> 47:25.458
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:25.458 --> 47:27.417
Let it come out.

47:27.417 --> 47:29.000
You just stay there.

47:29.000 --> 47:29.875
- Sure.

47:32.125 --> 47:35.250
(fist knocking)

47:35.250 --> 47:38.375
(suspenseful music)

47:45.667 --> 47:48.500
(fist knocking)

48:00.875 --> 48:02.500
(Julie scoffs)
(Alan sighs)

48:02.500 --> 48:04.917
- Firstly, what the
hell are you doing here?

48:06.125 --> 48:07.833
Secondly, what is going on?

48:07.833 --> 48:11.625
- All right, okay, all
right, just let me explain.

48:12.625 --> 48:13.500
- Go on.

48:14.917 --> 48:18.000
- They uh, they
brought the feds in.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.458
Another girl was found
dead this morning.

48:20.458 --> 48:21.833
- [Julie] Oh, Alan.

48:22.958 --> 48:24.292
- Yeah, right now I just
kinda wanna focus on

48:24.292 --> 48:26.250
getting this thing
over and down with

48:26.250 --> 48:30.333
so it doesn't get out
and harm anyone else.

48:30.333 --> 48:31.292
- Well, I don't think you need

48:31.292 --> 48:33.583
to worry about that much longer.

48:33.583 --> 48:35.583
- [Alan] What do you mean?

48:35.583 --> 48:36.875
- Go and turn on the news.

48:41.208 --> 48:46.417
(restaurant guests
talking over each other)

48:49.292 --> 48:53.083
- Hey, honey.
- What time do you call this?

48:53.083 --> 48:55.792
- Come on, can't we
make this a good night?

48:55.792 --> 48:59.583
- What, you want me to put
on a smile and just act like

48:59.583 --> 49:02.500
you being late all the
time isn't a big issue?

49:03.750 --> 49:05.958
- This thing's still
loose in our city.

49:05.958 --> 49:07.208
This is my job, all right?

49:07.208 --> 49:10.042
I can't just drop it
when I feel like it.

49:12.583 --> 49:13.500
- Drinks?

49:17.125 --> 49:19.875
- Vodka straight, please.
- Sure.

49:19.875 --> 49:22.458
- I guess I'll take the same.

49:23.542 --> 49:26.750
(light swanky music)

49:32.667 --> 49:37.875
(light dramatic music)
(rats squeaking)

49:38.500 --> 49:41.208
(rats scampering)

49:53.125 --> 49:55.125
(trash thudding)

49:55.125 --> 49:57.875
(rats squeaking)

49:57.875 --> 50:01.000
(suspenseful music)

50:03.292 --> 50:07.208
- Oh, shit, pickin' up
the fuckin' trash now.

50:08.500 --> 50:11.958
(trash rustling)

50:11.958 --> 50:14.833
(eerie music)

50:14.833 --> 50:17.917
(rats squeaking)
Vermin.

50:17.917 --> 50:23.125
(liquid splashing)
(suspenseful music)

50:28.500 --> 50:33.500
(dramatic music)
(mutant growling)

50:33.500 --> 50:36.708
(muffled rock music)

50:44.083 --> 50:45.750
Jay!

50:45.750 --> 50:49.000
(Tina screaming)
Help me!

50:49.000 --> 50:50.500
Jay!
(mutant growling)

50:50.500 --> 50:51.375
Help!

50:53.333 --> 50:56.250
(Tina screaming)

51:01.375 --> 51:02.750
(mutant grunting)
(flesh squishing)

51:02.750 --> 51:04.583
(body thudding)
(Tina gasps)

51:04.583 --> 51:06.750
(mutant screeching)

51:06.750 --> 51:07.417
(silverware clanking)

51:07.417 --> 51:10.875
(mutant growling)

51:10.875 --> 51:16.083
(ominous music)
(Tina panting)

51:28.167 --> 51:30.875
(Tina crying)

51:34.917 --> 51:37.833
(Tina screaming)

51:39.083 --> 51:42.208
(suspenseful music)

51:46.542 --> 51:51.750
(head crunching)
(mutant growling)

51:55.958 --> 51:59.458
(neck snapping)

51:59.458 --> 52:04.083
(body thudding)
(light swanky music)

52:04.083 --> 52:06.833
(mutant roaring)

52:08.958 --> 52:09.875
(waitress groaning)

52:09.875 --> 52:11.750
(bottles shattering)

52:11.750 --> 52:14.458
(waitress panting)

52:14.458 --> 52:19.667
(mutant groaning)
(claws thudding)

52:23.000 --> 52:26.125
(plates shattering)

52:27.208 --> 52:29.625
(mutant growling)

52:29.625 --> 52:32.250
(foot thudding)

52:32.250 --> 52:34.042
(chair crashing)

52:34.042 --> 52:36.667
(waitress groaning)

52:36.667 --> 52:39.500
(neck snapping)

52:45.042 --> 52:50.250
(flesh squishing)
(man screaming)

52:57.333 --> 53:02.542
(hand thudding)
(people screaming)

53:05.042 --> 53:06.333
(mutant growling)

53:06.333 --> 53:09.833
(woman screaming)

53:09.833 --> 53:12.958
(neck snapping)

53:12.958 --> 53:14.250
(woman screaming)

53:14.250 --> 53:18.792
(flesh squishing)
(woman screaming)

53:18.792 --> 53:21.750
(restaurant guests screaming)

53:21.750 --> 53:25.792
(man grunting)
(bottles shattering)

53:25.792 --> 53:27.083
(flesh squishing)
(man groaning)

53:27.083 --> 53:30.042
(woman screaming)

53:37.583 --> 53:40.792
- You brought a gun to
our anniversary dinner?

53:40.792 --> 53:44.250
- Fuckin' right, now
get the fuck out!

53:44.250 --> 53:46.000
(gunshots banging)

53:46.000 --> 53:48.125
(blood squishing)

53:48.125 --> 53:51.417
(suspenseful music)

53:53.250 --> 53:58.458
(Norton screaming)
(flesh squishing)

54:04.792 --> 54:07.667
(dramatic music)

54:17.708 --> 54:19.250
- You really think that'll work?

54:21.167 --> 54:24.500
- Sure, I mean, it's just
about keeping it inside.

54:27.208 --> 54:28.792
- Say it reproduces.

54:28.792 --> 54:31.167
I mean, what do we,
what do we do then?

54:32.458 --> 54:34.708
- Well, I mean, the
average rat reproduces

54:34.708 --> 54:38.250
every three weeks.

54:39.333 --> 54:41.042
And this being a mutated rat,

54:41.042 --> 54:46.167
I'd say it could vary anything
from months to weeks to days.

54:47.542 --> 54:49.375
I'd like to say that
days is unlikely,

54:49.375 --> 54:53.792
but I mean, look, the
faster we catch this thing,

54:53.792 --> 54:55.917
the faster we can end this.

55:00.917 --> 55:02.875
- Well, I'm gonna hit the sack.

55:02.875 --> 55:05.125
Doesn't look like it's
coming back tonight.

55:05.125 --> 55:06.792
- [Alan] Okay, I'll
stay up till sunrise.

55:06.792 --> 55:08.458
Don't worry.

55:08.458 --> 55:09.917
- Let me know if
you need anything.

55:09.917 --> 55:11.833
- Sure, sweet dreams.
- Good night.

55:11.833 --> 55:14.708
I've put some fresh linen
and towels upstairs for you.

55:14.708 --> 55:16.083
- [Julie] Oh, thanks.

55:19.500 --> 55:21.500
- [Alan] Ah, man.

55:21.500 --> 55:23.667
- Everything all right?

55:23.667 --> 55:27.667
- Ah, it's just, just
my back still stings

55:27.667 --> 55:29.167
from the other night.

55:29.167 --> 55:32.167
I shoulda got it checked out
earlier today, but (sighs).

55:33.375 --> 55:34.583
- Let me take a look.

55:34.583 --> 55:36.000
I can help.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.917
- Any excuse to get
my shirt off, eh?

55:39.125 --> 55:40.625
- You wish.

55:40.625 --> 55:42.958
Come on, I am a doctor.

55:42.958 --> 55:44.417
- Oh, I know.
- Show me.

55:45.708 --> 55:48.542
(Alan groaning)

55:56.125 --> 55:58.792
Looks like these bandages
haven't been changed.

56:00.292 --> 56:03.375
You should be changing these
twice a day to avoid infection.

56:04.750 --> 56:07.375
Have you been using antiseptic?

56:07.375 --> 56:08.875
- No, I was just using
whatever the police doctor

56:08.875 --> 56:11.667
gave me when they
first checked me over.

56:11.667 --> 56:14.792
- Alan, that rat coulda been
carrying all kinds of diseases.

56:17.917 --> 56:20.292
Can you please take
care of yourself better?

56:21.917 --> 56:22.792
- Yes, ma'am.

56:27.167 --> 56:29.875
(light music)

56:29.875 --> 56:31.167
- This is gonna sting.

56:34.917 --> 56:36.917
- God fuckin' dammit.

56:36.917 --> 56:40.625
(Alan clears throat)

56:40.625 --> 56:43.083
(Alan sighs)

56:45.333 --> 56:47.583
Thank you for caring.

56:48.708 --> 56:50.083
It feels like it's been a while

56:50.083 --> 56:53.125
since someone actually
cared, you know?

56:54.542 --> 56:55.708
- I could say the same.

56:57.000 --> 56:57.917
- How do you mean?

56:59.417 --> 57:02.083
- I don't believe that anyone

57:02.083 --> 57:04.125
truly has the perfect marriage.

57:05.667 --> 57:08.125
I mean, I get that people
have their hiccups.

57:08.125 --> 57:10.542
You know, the ups and downs.
- Uh huh.

57:12.542 --> 57:14.083
- That's all I'm gonna say.

57:15.458 --> 57:17.458
- What, he didn't
make you feel loved?

57:19.333 --> 57:20.542
- He was a busy guy.

57:22.458 --> 57:23.875
- Oh, I know that story.

57:25.917 --> 57:29.208
I think that's, that's where
I messed up with Jenna.

57:30.917 --> 57:35.042
I just wasn't as much
as I shoulda been,

57:35.042 --> 57:36.542
and when I was, I didn't...

57:38.583 --> 57:40.917
I didn't give her the
attention she deserved.

57:40.917 --> 57:42.792
- People lead busy lives.

57:42.792 --> 57:45.000
It's easy to get caught up.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.667
It's understandable.

57:48.833 --> 57:50.833
- Yeah, but what's not
understandable is not seeing

57:50.833 --> 57:52.708
what's right there
in front of you.

57:55.042 --> 57:59.375
And not showing that
person day in and day out

57:59.375 --> 58:00.875
how much they mean to you.

58:03.500 --> 58:05.667
That's supposed to be
the easy part, right?

58:07.375 --> 58:09.875
(light music)

58:15.083 --> 58:17.917
(bugs chirping)

58:23.667 --> 58:26.458
(fist knocking)

58:31.667 --> 58:33.875
- Who's that?
- What?

58:33.875 --> 58:36.167
- Who's at the door?

58:36.167 --> 58:37.042
- Oh, shit.

58:38.083 --> 58:39.250
Shit, I fell asleep.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.375
You stay here.

58:43.375 --> 58:44.292
I'll go check.

58:46.500 --> 58:49.333
(Alan groaning)

58:51.083 --> 58:54.500
(door creaking)

58:54.500 --> 58:55.958
- Thought we'd find you here.

58:57.375 --> 58:58.583
- What's going on?

59:00.042 --> 59:01.458
- Have you seen the news?

59:03.292 --> 59:04.917
- With all that we know now,

59:04.917 --> 59:07.333
did the police leave
this too late to tell us?

59:07.333 --> 59:10.250
Should we all have been
warned much sooner?

59:10.250 --> 59:12.708
What we know is that
this so-called beast

59:12.708 --> 59:16.208
has now taken the lives
of dozens of citizens.

59:16.208 --> 59:18.375
But perhaps that coulda
been avoided if the public

59:18.375 --> 59:20.000
had been made aware much sooner

59:20.000 --> 59:22.958
that a beast was on
the loose in the city.

59:22.958 --> 59:24.708
Police have confirmed
that the beast

59:24.708 --> 59:26.917
is a wild and predatory animal,

59:26.917 --> 59:30.250
possibly ranging between
five and six feet in height.

59:30.250 --> 59:33.250
The advice is to stay
indoors until further news,

59:33.250 --> 59:35.708
and avoid drainage
areas and sewers.

59:35.708 --> 59:38.125
They're advising that
if you see the beast,

59:38.125 --> 59:39.500
do not approach.

59:40.708 --> 59:42.458
People are being told
to travel in groups

59:42.458 --> 59:45.750
of at least two persons,
keeping to well lit streets

59:45.750 --> 59:47.958
and avoiding evenings
and night times.

59:52.208 --> 59:53.625
- We need your help.

59:54.292 --> 59:55.208
- Of course.

59:58.042 --> 59:59.875
- You already have an idea?

1:00:01.042 --> 1:00:02.167
- What, us being
back in the house

1:00:02.167 --> 1:00:04.375
wasn't enough of a clue for you?

1:00:04.375 --> 1:00:05.542
It'll come back.

1:00:05.542 --> 1:00:07.208
We just gotta wait it out.

1:00:07.208 --> 1:00:08.708
- Well, how can you be so sure?

1:00:08.708 --> 1:00:10.125
- Look, I can't be
sure of anything,

1:00:10.125 --> 1:00:12.667
but I can damn well be
ready if it does come back.

1:00:13.875 --> 1:00:16.000
- How the fuck are you
three gonna take it out?

1:00:18.500 --> 1:00:20.875
- Look, you called us
for a reason, right?

1:00:22.250 --> 1:00:25.708
So, unless you have a better
idea, this is the plan.

1:00:25.708 --> 1:00:29.875
Now, you can stay and
help us or you can leave,

1:00:29.875 --> 1:00:32.667
and go about whatever little
plan you've already got.

1:00:34.125 --> 1:00:36.917
No one's forcing you to
stay here, all right?

1:00:36.917 --> 1:00:37.875
It's your choice.

1:00:43.875 --> 1:00:44.958
- Tell us what to do.

1:00:51.542 --> 1:00:54.333
(bugs chirping)

1:00:54.333 --> 1:00:57.042
(trunk creaking)

1:00:59.917 --> 1:01:02.208
- We're gonna need something
to defend ourselves.

1:01:02.208 --> 1:01:03.833
- You didn't bring a firearm?

1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:06.250
I thought you wild
animal experts

1:01:06.250 --> 1:01:07.542
all had that as
part of your job.

1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:11.583
- Well, pick your poison.

1:01:13.375 --> 1:01:14.667
- I'll stick with my gun.

1:01:16.292 --> 1:01:17.958
My friend died last
night because he couldn't

1:01:17.958 --> 1:01:20.042
defend himself
against that thing.

1:01:23.458 --> 1:01:27.000
I'm carrying and I'll
use it if needed.

1:01:29.458 --> 1:01:34.417
- Look, I'm, I'm sorry
about Captain Norton.

1:01:38.875 --> 1:01:40.792
We're gonna get this
fucker, all right?

1:01:42.667 --> 1:01:43.750
- Damn right.

1:01:50.167 --> 1:01:53.250
(trunk slamming)

1:01:53.250 --> 1:01:56.417
(mutant screeching)

1:01:56.417 --> 1:01:58.083
- Okay, we need
to go back inside.

1:01:58.083 --> 1:01:59.000
Come on, come on.

1:02:04.792 --> 1:02:07.708
- This gas, it'll actually work?

1:02:07.708 --> 1:02:11.583
I mean, you didn't
seem convinced earlier.

1:02:11.583 --> 1:02:16.042
- Yeah, well, I didn't
really understand it earlier.

1:02:16.042 --> 1:02:19.583
But as long as we keep it
in the house it should work.

1:02:21.542 --> 1:02:24.583
(mutant shrieking)

1:02:33.667 --> 1:02:36.167
(Linda sighs)

1:02:40.167 --> 1:02:42.458
- Be ready.
- What's going on?

1:02:42.458 --> 1:02:43.333
- It's coming.

1:03:04.125 --> 1:03:05.875
- What are you
planning on doing?

1:03:05.875 --> 1:03:07.250
Stay inside the house.

1:03:07.250 --> 1:03:09.125
- I'm gonna lure it
back to the house.

1:03:09.125 --> 1:03:10.333
Now, get back in the house

1:03:10.333 --> 1:03:11.583
and just make sure
every door is locked.

1:03:11.583 --> 1:03:13.750
- You need to be careful.

1:03:13.750 --> 1:03:15.417
- I got this!

1:03:15.417 --> 1:03:17.792
Go back in the house.

1:03:23.667 --> 1:03:25.833
- Just in case.

1:03:25.833 --> 1:03:27.792
- We are gassing
it, not shooting it.

1:03:27.792 --> 1:03:32.583
- We're gonna do anything we
need to to fuckin' kill it.

1:03:32.583 --> 1:03:36.250
(gun clicks)
It's jammed.

1:03:37.875 --> 1:03:40.875
(mutant growling)

1:03:42.625 --> 1:03:45.458
(ominous music)

1:03:50.208 --> 1:03:51.708
- What was that?

1:04:14.333 --> 1:04:17.125
(bugs chirping)

1:04:28.250 --> 1:04:31.333
(suspenseful music)

1:04:33.167 --> 1:04:34.458
- Where is it?

1:04:38.625 --> 1:04:42.000
(mutant growling)
(Julie screaming)

1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.208
(gunshot banging)

1:04:44.208 --> 1:04:47.083
(McKenna groaning)

1:04:47.083 --> 1:04:49.833
(McKenna gagging)

1:04:49.833 --> 1:04:50.792
(foot thudding)
(Chambers grunting)

1:04:50.792 --> 1:04:51.708
(Chambers panting)

1:04:51.708 --> 1:04:54.833
(Chambers groaning)

1:04:57.750 --> 1:04:59.167
(bat thudding)
(Julie grunting)

1:04:59.167 --> 1:05:02.208
(Chambers screaming)

1:05:02.208 --> 1:05:06.000
- Get Alan!
(claw thudding)

1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:13.208
(mutant growling)
(dramatic music)

1:05:22.833 --> 1:05:25.750
(Julie groaning)

1:05:27.750 --> 1:05:30.750

1:05:48.208 --> 1:05:52.292
(mutant growling)
(mutant pounding)

1:05:52.292 --> 1:05:55.333
(Chambers panting)

1:05:58.500 --> 1:06:00.750
- [Alan] Open the door!

1:06:00.750 --> 1:06:02.583
- Fuck, I can't open
it, it's fuckin' locked.

1:06:02.583 --> 1:06:05.833
(Julie screaming)
Where's the key?

1:06:05.833 --> 1:06:07.083
I need to go
upstairs and get her.

1:06:07.083 --> 1:06:08.917
- You go, I'll find
another way in.

1:06:09.792 --> 1:06:13.167
(light dramatic music)

1:06:20.250 --> 1:06:21.167
(Alan panting)

1:06:21.167 --> 1:06:22.083
Goddammit.

1:06:26.625 --> 1:06:29.667
Linda, it's in the house.

1:06:29.667 --> 1:06:30.542
- I know.

1:06:32.167 --> 1:06:33.750
- So, you get outside
and wait there.

1:06:33.750 --> 1:06:35.667
I'll get Julie and
then we'll gas it.

1:06:39.792 --> 1:06:40.708
- Leave it to me.

1:06:42.083 --> 1:06:43.000
I'm going to.

1:06:44.542 --> 1:06:46.583
- What the hell?
- I'm sorry, Alan.

1:06:47.667 --> 1:06:49.708
I've got to do it myself.

1:06:49.708 --> 1:06:51.958
- No, what the hell is this?

1:06:51.958 --> 1:06:55.292
- Just stay there.
(eerie music)

1:07:03.125 --> 1:07:06.125
(mutant growling)

1:07:07.667 --> 1:07:10.292
(Alan groaning)

1:07:10.292 --> 1:07:11.208
- Marsh?

1:07:13.583 --> 1:07:18.792
(glass shattering)
(Alan groaning)

1:07:27.125 --> 1:07:28.167
Julie, you up here?

1:07:30.417 --> 1:07:31.292
- Yes.

1:07:36.417 --> 1:07:37.417
- Is it locked?

1:07:39.417 --> 1:07:40.792
- Yes.

1:07:40.792 --> 1:07:43.542
(gun clicking)

1:07:43.542 --> 1:07:48.708

1:08:15.750 --> 1:08:16.750
(Chambers gasping)

1:08:16.750 --> 1:08:21.666
Oh no, oh God.
(dramatic music)

1:08:21.666 --> 1:08:25.166
(Chambers panting)

1:08:25.166 --> 1:08:30.375
(fists thudding)
(mutant groaning)

1:08:37.333 --> 1:08:40.375
(table smashing)
(Chambers groaning)

1:08:40.375 --> 1:08:45.583
(Chambers panting)
(dramatic music)

1:08:47.625 --> 1:08:50.875
(chemicals splashing)

1:08:50.875 --> 1:08:54.791
(glass shattering)

1:08:54.791 --> 1:08:57.750
(knife whooshing)

1:08:57.750 --> 1:09:00.875
(gate creaking)

1:09:00.875 --> 1:09:04.791
(Chambers panting)
(mutant growling)

1:09:04.791 --> 1:09:10.000
(metal bars creaking)
(suspenseful music)

1:09:23.208 --> 1:09:26.333
(light eerie music)

1:09:40.791 --> 1:09:46.000
(Chambers panting)
(metal bars creaking)

1:09:51.125 --> 1:09:54.208
(suspenseful music)

1:09:55.416 --> 1:09:57.500
(mutant growling)

1:09:57.500 --> 1:10:01.541
(suspenseful music continues)

1:10:22.458 --> 1:10:25.541
(Chambers panting)

1:10:27.916 --> 1:10:29.916
(dramatic music)

1:10:29.916 --> 1:10:32.625
(Chambers gasping)
(mutant growling)

1:10:32.625 --> 1:10:37.833
(Chambers screaming)
(flesh squishing)

1:10:54.875 --> 1:10:57.833
(mutant growling)

1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:04.041
(gunshot banging)
(ominous music)

1:11:12.250 --> 1:11:13.791
(Chambers gasps)

1:11:13.791 --> 1:11:19.000
(Linda panting)
(gunshots banging)

1:11:20.666 --> 1:11:24.000
(light dramatic music)

1:11:28.250 --> 1:11:29.291
- I'm sorry.

1:11:34.625 --> 1:11:35.500
Sorry.

1:11:41.958 --> 1:11:45.166
(Chambers screaming)

1:11:46.875 --> 1:11:49.833
(stairs creaking)

1:11:53.166 --> 1:11:56.166
(flesh squishing)

1:12:04.625 --> 1:12:07.125
(eerie music)

1:12:14.208 --> 1:12:17.041
(door rattling)

1:12:18.250 --> 1:12:21.083
(Alan coughing)

1:12:33.041 --> 1:12:37.333
(door thudding)
(dramatic music)

1:12:37.333 --> 1:12:41.625
- Alan, are you okay?
(Alan groaning)

1:12:41.625 --> 1:12:43.041
- Where is it?

1:12:43.041 --> 1:12:44.708
- [Julie] It's locked
in the dining room.

1:12:44.708 --> 1:12:46.708
- What, what the hell happened?

1:12:46.708 --> 1:12:49.250
- I think it was Linda.

1:12:49.250 --> 1:12:50.000
- What?

1:12:51.583 --> 1:12:53.458
- I found these
documents upstairs.

1:12:54.875 --> 1:12:57.291
I think she's been keeping
close to us to monitor us.

1:12:57.291 --> 1:12:59.125
To stop us from killing the rat.

1:13:00.750 --> 1:13:02.500
I don't think her husband
made this monster at all.

1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:04.166
- What are you saying?

1:13:04.166 --> 1:13:07.041
- I'm saying, these
documents are Linda's.

1:13:08.458 --> 1:13:11.875
I think she was experimenting
on the rat to help her mother,

1:13:11.875 --> 1:13:14.541
and I think it escaped
and killed her husband,

1:13:14.541 --> 1:13:16.666
and now she's trying
to cover her tracks.

1:13:17.833 --> 1:13:18.750
Look.

1:13:22.375 --> 1:13:23.916
- What the hell?

1:13:24.875 --> 1:13:28.000
(light dramatic music)

1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:32.250
- Why'd you have to go through
and find all the information?

1:13:32.250 --> 1:13:34.250
- Linda, what in the
hell is going on?

1:13:38.416 --> 1:13:40.333
- She suffered a horrible death.

1:13:42.708 --> 1:13:44.666
The cancer spread so rapidly.

1:13:46.916 --> 1:13:48.375
There was nothing we could do,

1:13:49.916 --> 1:13:53.583
but sit back and watch her
suffer until her drying breath.

1:13:56.458 --> 1:13:59.833
To prevent anyone else from
ever experiencing this again,

1:14:01.458 --> 1:14:05.833
I tried to make something in
vain of what happened to her.

1:14:07.750 --> 1:14:09.125
To honor her life.

1:14:10.291 --> 1:14:13.083
A cure that could
prevent anyone else

1:14:13.083 --> 1:14:16.000
from having to go through
what my mother had to.

1:14:17.250 --> 1:14:20.583
I found an antidote
that reverses cells

1:14:20.583 --> 1:14:22.583
from growing at such a pace.

1:14:23.875 --> 1:14:28.083
The idea was the cells
would reduce in size,

1:14:28.083 --> 1:14:31.833
become manageable, so
the patient could live

1:14:31.833 --> 1:14:35.125
with the disease for
many, many years.

1:14:37.166 --> 1:14:38.083
It went wrong.

1:14:40.833 --> 1:14:45.500
In fact, what I made
had the opposite effect.

1:14:45.500 --> 1:14:49.375
It made cells grow
at such a pace

1:14:49.375 --> 1:14:53.375
that it enlarged the body
the way a steroid would.

1:14:55.791 --> 1:14:59.250
The rat I was testing on
was growing at such a pace,

1:15:00.875 --> 1:15:02.833
I documented it
over several weeks.

1:15:04.250 --> 1:15:06.250
- What, that thing was in
this house for several weeks?

1:15:06.250 --> 1:15:11.458
- One night it must've
escaped, and found Peter.

1:15:15.916 --> 1:15:17.083
And it killed him.

1:15:20.250 --> 1:15:22.291
If Peter hadn't died that night,

1:15:24.125 --> 1:15:27.166
I believe I would've found
the answers I was looking for.

1:15:29.250 --> 1:15:32.041
The reaction the rat
had was a positive one,

1:15:32.041 --> 1:15:35.125
even though it didn't work for
the direction I wanted it to.

1:15:36.583 --> 1:15:40.541
If I had more time I could've
studied how to reverse it

1:15:40.541 --> 1:15:44.791
and make the cells
dissolve at a similar pace.

1:15:47.666 --> 1:15:48.916
I was so close.

1:15:50.208 --> 1:15:52.250
- And now, he's
gone and we've got

1:15:52.250 --> 1:15:55.333
a mutated rat just
dying to tear us apart.

1:15:55.333 --> 1:15:57.208
So, what the fuck is
your big idea, Linda?

1:15:57.208 --> 1:15:58.291
What is your plan?

1:15:59.625 --> 1:16:01.208
- I have to end this now.

1:16:03.583 --> 1:16:04.625
This is all my fault.

1:16:08.833 --> 1:16:11.125
I was only trying to
do the right thing.

1:16:13.125 --> 1:16:16.583
I'm so sorry it got out of hand.

1:16:16.583 --> 1:16:19.750
I did not mean for
any of this to happen.

1:16:21.458 --> 1:16:24.666
- You were using
me for information.

1:16:26.875 --> 1:16:32.083
- As we continued to
meet, the more we met,

1:16:33.291 --> 1:16:35.625
the more I realized how
they were involving you.

1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:42.208
- No, no, no, no, no, you
used me for information.

1:16:42.208 --> 1:16:44.375
Why didn't you just
tell me what you did?

1:16:44.375 --> 1:16:45.791
I coulda helped you.

1:16:45.791 --> 1:16:49.750
- And risk going to jail
for what's happened?

1:16:49.750 --> 1:16:52.875
You seemed to have a plan
how to capture the rat.

1:16:52.875 --> 1:16:54.625
I had already tried and failed.

1:16:56.041 --> 1:16:57.291
- What do you mean?

1:16:59.458 --> 1:17:04.875
Wait, when I came here to
warn you and I got attacked,

1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:07.666
you lead it here?

1:17:08.833 --> 1:17:10.583
- It returned while I was gone.

1:17:13.541 --> 1:17:14.875
I was too late to trap it.

1:17:18.625 --> 1:17:20.500
I'm sorry for what
happened to you.

1:17:21.833 --> 1:17:23.250
I felt so bad.

1:17:27.375 --> 1:17:31.208
If I'd been here, I could've
just killed it myself.

1:17:32.458 --> 1:17:35.500
- Just, just, just
lower your gun.

1:17:35.500 --> 1:17:37.000
Let us, let us help you.

1:17:38.625 --> 1:17:42.458
- No, I want you to get
out of the house, Alan.

1:17:43.541 --> 1:17:44.958
Let me deal with this.

1:17:44.958 --> 1:17:46.833
- You can't do this alone.
(suspenseful music)

1:17:46.833 --> 1:17:49.166
Just, just, just let
us, let us help you.

1:17:50.375 --> 1:17:53.166
- I started this,
now I gotta end it.

1:17:53.166 --> 1:17:55.625
- All right, I get it, I
get why you did it, okay?

1:17:55.625 --> 1:17:56.833
Just let us help you.

1:17:56.833 --> 1:17:58.583
Give me the gun,
give me the gun.

1:17:58.583 --> 1:18:00.708
- Just get outta
the house, Alan.

1:18:00.708 --> 1:18:03.833
(suspenseful music)
This isn't safe.

1:18:03.833 --> 1:18:04.750
(McKenna grunting)
(bat thudding)

1:18:04.750 --> 1:18:07.625
(Linda groaning)

1:18:14.416 --> 1:18:16.708
- What the hell was
this woman playing at?

1:18:16.708 --> 1:18:19.208
- Julie, McKenna, get
outside, get Linda.

1:18:19.208 --> 1:18:20.416
- What?

1:18:20.416 --> 1:18:22.250
- Just go outside, I'll
meet you out there.

1:18:22.250 --> 1:18:23.500
- I'm not leaving you.

1:18:23.500 --> 1:18:25.541
- Look, I'm gonna
set this thing off.

1:18:25.541 --> 1:18:28.583
You get Linda, find a window,
and no matter what happens,

1:18:28.583 --> 1:18:29.791
just get out, all right?

1:18:31.625 --> 1:18:32.541
Okay?

1:18:34.250 --> 1:18:35.166
- Okay.

1:18:36.500 --> 1:18:38.291
(door creaking)

1:18:38.291 --> 1:18:41.000
(eerie music)

1:18:51.833 --> 1:18:54.583
(mutant growling)

1:18:54.583 --> 1:18:56.333
Linda, wake up, we've
gotta get out of here.

1:18:56.333 --> 1:18:58.333
(Linda groaning)

1:18:58.333 --> 1:19:00.125
- I have to kill it.

1:19:02.625 --> 1:19:04.041
I gotta kill it.

1:19:04.041 --> 1:19:06.708
Oh, (groaning).

1:19:08.500 --> 1:19:11.166
(eerie music)

1:19:21.375 --> 1:19:26.583
(flesh squishing)
(suspenseful music)

1:19:41.625 --> 1:19:44.125
(gas hissing)

1:19:46.166 --> 1:19:49.291
(suspenseful music)

1:20:07.833 --> 1:20:10.708
(dramatic music)
