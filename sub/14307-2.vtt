00:03.600 --> 00:05.967
(male narrator)
Previously, on a very special
Clone High:

00:05.967 --> 00:07.533
Tempers flared,

00:07.533 --> 00:09.633
robotic butlers cared,

00:09.633 --> 00:11.667
saliva was shared,

00:11.667 --> 00:15.833
and you, the audience,
were moved very, very deeply.

00:15.833 --> 00:16.833
**

00:16.833 --> 00:18.400
[whispering]
Trust me.

00:18.400 --> 00:21.033
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way, way back in the 1980s

00:21.033 --> 00:23.967
* Secret government employees

00:23.967 --> 00:26.867
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

00:26.867 --> 00:29.900
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

00:29.900 --> 00:32.700
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

00:32.700 --> 00:35.533
* They're going to make it
if they try *

00:35.533 --> 00:38.533
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

00:38.533 --> 00:44.767
* Time to laugh
and shiver and cry *

00:44.767 --> 00:47.500
* Clone High

00:47.500 --> 00:53.200
* Clone High

00:53.200 --> 00:54.433
*

00:54.433 --> 00:56.500
All students are special
at Clone High,

00:56.500 --> 00:58.467
but only some students
are ostracized

00:58.467 --> 01:00.200
because they're special.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.267
That is why it is
my great pleasure,

01:02.267 --> 01:03.900
as president
of the student body,

01:03.900 --> 01:06.233
to officially dedicate
this impassable moat,

01:06.233 --> 01:08.367
protecting us from
the special ed. classroom.

01:08.367 --> 01:09.767
[applause]

01:09.767 --> 01:12.800
Surprised Cleopatra didn't
fill the moat with acid.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.433
Actually, Cleo says it
would kill the piranhas.

01:15.433 --> 01:17.267
Joan of Arc, don't think
about the moat

01:17.267 --> 01:19.300
in terms of its
divisive ignorance,

01:19.300 --> 01:21.967
think of it as an opportunity
for building community.

01:21.967 --> 01:23.100
Hey, community!

01:23.100 --> 01:24.233
Skinny-dipping in
the piranha moat!

01:24.233 --> 01:25.233
Yow!

01:25.233 --> 01:27.833
Everybody get
naked!

01:27.833 --> 01:29.467
Whoo!
[splash]

01:29.467 --> 01:30.867
Finally,

01:30.867 --> 01:33.500
I won't be running
for re-election this year.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.200
[voice breaking]
This is probably
the last time

01:35.200 --> 01:38.500
I'll ever use these oversized
novelty scissors.

01:38.500 --> 01:41.833
Unless a giant
needs a haircut.

01:41.833 --> 01:43.467
Oh, God.

01:43.467 --> 01:45.600
I've got to go
console her.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.767
Abe Lincoln, don't.

01:46.767 --> 01:48.067
She's just trying
to get attention

01:48.067 --> 01:49.633
and you're falling for it.

01:49.633 --> 01:52.333
Ugh, it makes me so mad
I could kiss you.

01:52.333 --> 01:54.533
What was that
last part?

01:54.533 --> 01:55.967
I'm sorry, what?

01:55.967 --> 01:59.533
[stammering]
No, I said I could piss glue.

01:59.533 --> 02:00.900
As in,

02:00.900 --> 02:03.900
"Oh, I'm so angry
I could piss glue."

02:03.900 --> 02:05.133
I've never
heard of that.

02:05.133 --> 02:06.167
Well, it's a very common
expression.

02:06.167 --> 02:07.333
Huh.

02:07.333 --> 02:09.667
Well,
see ya.

02:09.667 --> 02:10.667
[exhales]

02:10.667 --> 02:12.600
Stupid, Joan.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.600
Real stupid.

02:13.600 --> 02:14.767
[piranhas chomping]

02:14.767 --> 02:15.867
[plop]

02:15.867 --> 02:18.900
[sobbing]
Oh, JFK.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.700
I can't bear
to talk about it.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.333
Thank God, because I
hate it when--

02:22.333 --> 02:24.300
It all started
freshman year.

02:24.300 --> 02:27.067
I was elected
president.

02:27.067 --> 02:29.067
But now...

02:29.067 --> 02:30.633
[sobbing]
Oh, JFK.

02:30.633 --> 02:32.067
There, there.

02:32.067 --> 02:33.933
It's term limits,
Jack.

02:33.933 --> 02:36.500
Dirty, dirty
term limits.

02:36.500 --> 02:37.933
[cheery]
My only hope is if someone,

02:37.933 --> 02:38.933
and I have
no idea who,

02:38.933 --> 02:40.167
could run for president,
win,

02:40.167 --> 02:41.433
abolish term limits,
resign,

02:41.433 --> 02:42.967
and endorse me as his
replacement.

02:42.967 --> 02:44.200
But who?

02:44.200 --> 02:45.267
Who?

02:45.267 --> 02:46.267
Huh?

02:46.267 --> 02:48.500
Oh, thank you, JFK.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.867
Thank you
for your courage.

02:50.867 --> 02:52.667
Can we make out now?

02:52.667 --> 02:55.300
Totally.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.800
[moaning]

02:56.800 --> 02:58.167
Hey, Cleo.

02:58.167 --> 02:59.600
[Cleopatra and JFK making out]

02:59.600 --> 03:01.667
Oh.

03:01.667 --> 03:05.900
(Principal Scudworth)
Your secret army
of clone historical figures

03:05.900 --> 03:08.500
is maturing according
to schedule.

03:08.500 --> 03:10.200
I'm sorry, Scudworth,
is that a scale model

03:10.200 --> 03:12.200
behind you labeled
"Dr. Scudworth's Evil Plan"?

03:14.333 --> 03:15.667
Say!

03:15.667 --> 03:17.800
Where'd you get those
fresh Pumas, bro?

03:17.800 --> 03:20.067
Actually, we're sponsored
by Puma.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.667
These bad boys
are catalogue only.

03:22.667 --> 03:24.433
If you're implying
that I intend

03:24.433 --> 03:26.067
to steal the clones
away from you

03:26.067 --> 03:28.633
and use them in an expensive
clone theme amusement park,

03:28.633 --> 03:30.067
then shame on you.

03:30.067 --> 03:32.100
By the by,
could I have $2 million?

03:33.333 --> 03:35.933
[laughs]
You know...

03:35.933 --> 03:37.967
for dry-erase markers
and such.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.767
They've got some
keen new colors.

03:39.767 --> 03:42.467
There's kiwi and...

03:42.467 --> 03:43.733
mango.

03:43.733 --> 03:46.067
For giggles, I'm going
to keep saying "no"

03:46.067 --> 03:47.600
until you
turn the TV off.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.800
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no--

03:49.800 --> 03:50.833
[electronic whirring]

03:51.900 --> 03:53.067
[sighs]

03:53.067 --> 03:54.533
Perhaps you could get

03:54.533 --> 03:56.933
Clone High
a corporate sponsor.

03:56.933 --> 04:00.133
Those Pumas
were rather fresh.

04:00.133 --> 04:01.200
Sell out?

04:01.200 --> 04:02.633
And turn the school
into an ad

04:02.633 --> 04:05.200
for some profit-hungry
corporation?

04:05.200 --> 04:06.967
Why, that idea's
as foolish

04:06.967 --> 04:11.833
as getting new brakes
from anywhere but Midas.

04:11.833 --> 04:15.200
(Joan)
I can't believe JFK
is running unopposed.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.733
I mean, you'd think with
a school full of world leaders

04:17.733 --> 04:19.600
someone would be into
student government.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.967
Well, I'm a genetic duplicate
of Abe Lincoln

04:21.967 --> 04:23.267
and I'm not fit
to be president.

04:23.267 --> 04:25.100
If I only knew
what fears

04:25.100 --> 04:27.367
and insecurities
were holding me back.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.967
[slurping]

04:28.967 --> 04:30.100
Abe, you should run.

04:30.100 --> 04:31.500
I'll manage your campaign.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.567
Together, we'll fight
for things that really matter,

04:33.567 --> 04:35.367
like new bishops
for the chess club.

04:35.367 --> 04:36.867
So what you're
saying is,

04:36.867 --> 04:39.533
if I run for president,
I can get Cleo to like me.

04:39.533 --> 04:41.067
That's why
she likes JFK,

04:41.067 --> 04:42.500
because he's
a natural leader.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.967
Great idea, Joan.

04:44.967 --> 04:45.967
[yells]

04:45.967 --> 04:47.567
[crash]

04:47.567 --> 04:48.800
Clumsy, Joan.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.300
Really clumsy.

04:51.300 --> 04:52.300
(Scudworth)
So...

04:52.300 --> 04:54.167
your product is called--

04:54.167 --> 04:55.400
X-Stream Blu!

04:55.400 --> 04:56.733
It's a power snack!

04:56.733 --> 04:58.467
Stick it in
your face hole!

04:58.467 --> 04:59.733
This is something
you eat?

04:59.733 --> 05:01.367
[whispering]
It's really just pancake batter

05:01.367 --> 05:02.900
mixed with blue house paint
in a sports bottle.

05:02.900 --> 05:03.900
Sick!
Tight!

05:03.900 --> 05:05.233
Cyber awesome!

05:06.867 --> 05:08.200
I see.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.900
Now, for allowing you
to test market

05:09.900 --> 05:11.700
this X-Stream Blu
on my students,

05:11.700 --> 05:14.567
I am willing to be paid
$2 million.

05:14.567 --> 05:16.100
Allow me to confer
with my associates.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.133
[screams]

05:17.133 --> 05:18.667
- To the max!
- Literally!

05:18.667 --> 05:21.100
I have low
self-esteem!

05:22.433 --> 05:23.933
We accept
your offer.

05:23.933 --> 05:26.167
[gasps]
Dead presidents, Mr. B.

05:26.167 --> 05:27.667
[squeaks]

05:27.667 --> 05:30.200
(JFK)
Ask not what
your student body president

05:30.200 --> 05:31.600
can do for you,

05:31.600 --> 05:33.333
ask what you can do

05:33.333 --> 05:35.567
to your
student body president's body.

05:35.567 --> 05:36.867
[cheering]

05:36.867 --> 05:38.567
Okay, there's nothing
to worry about.

05:38.567 --> 05:40.167
He's just making
empty promises

05:40.167 --> 05:41.867
and detailing
his workout routine.

05:41.867 --> 05:45.267
And on Fridays,
I do abs and legs,

05:45.267 --> 05:47.433
but not calves.

05:47.433 --> 05:49.067
As you recall,

05:49.067 --> 05:53.500
I do those with my lats
on Wednesdays!

05:53.500 --> 05:54.500
[cheering]

05:54.500 --> 05:55.500
Thank you!

05:55.500 --> 05:56.633
Good luck.

05:56.633 --> 06:00.867
[audience cheering]

06:00.867 --> 06:02.200
[Cleopatra and JFK
making out]

06:02.200 --> 06:04.133
My name is Abraham Lincoln

06:04.133 --> 06:07.300
and I'm running
for student body president.

06:08.767 --> 06:11.167
(woman screaming)
I love you, JFK!

06:13.700 --> 06:17.067
We've got a lot of tough issues
facing us right now,

06:17.067 --> 06:20.333
such as adding a second section
of AP calculus

06:20.333 --> 06:22.867
for those who have a conflict
between that class

06:22.867 --> 06:24.533
and AP physics.

06:24.533 --> 06:25.567
[clapping]

06:25.567 --> 06:27.067
But first and foremost,

06:27.067 --> 06:30.367
we must get tinted windows
for the albino wing.

06:30.367 --> 06:31.467
[clapping]

06:31.467 --> 06:32.400
Whoo!

06:35.067 --> 06:36.833
Okay, you're done.

06:36.833 --> 06:39.967
Young men and women,
please give it up for

06:39.967 --> 06:42.400
the X-Stream Blu mega crew!

06:42.400 --> 06:43.567
[rock music]

06:43.567 --> 06:47.133
[audience cheering]

06:47.133 --> 06:48.467
Hey, everyone!

06:48.467 --> 06:50.100
I'm Tyler,
that's Paco,

06:50.100 --> 06:51.800
and we want you to
get up out of your seats

06:51.800 --> 06:54.067
and clap your hands
to the beat.

06:54.067 --> 06:55.800
[clapping]

06:55.800 --> 06:57.667
(Tyler)
'Cause we're gonna tell you
about X-Stream Blu,

06:57.667 --> 06:59.533
a new max wicked food product

06:59.533 --> 07:01.733
that lives where
extreme meets blue.

07:01.733 --> 07:05.967
It comes in a totally sick
wide-mouth squeeze bottle!

07:05.967 --> 07:07.833
[squish]

07:07.833 --> 07:09.267
[plop]

07:09.267 --> 07:10.267
Email!

07:10.267 --> 07:12.300
That looks
so good!

07:12.300 --> 07:13.300
What's in it?

07:13.300 --> 07:15.067
Great question!

07:15.067 --> 07:17.067
Have a t-shirt.

07:17.067 --> 07:18.600
[boom]

07:18.600 --> 07:21.400
That totally
answers my question!

07:21.400 --> 07:24.433
Man, the audience
was not having that.

07:24.433 --> 07:25.433
Huh, guys?

07:25.433 --> 07:26.800
Um, Abe?

07:26.800 --> 07:29.433
Just give me a few
more minutes of denial.

07:33.800 --> 07:39.733
[banging]

07:41.900 --> 07:43.067
Abe, Abe,

07:43.067 --> 07:44.967
your speech wasn't
that bad.

07:44.967 --> 07:47.633
Okay, maybe the encore
wasn't the best idea,

07:47.633 --> 07:48.633
but the speech
itself--

07:48.633 --> 07:49.633
Whoo!

07:49.633 --> 07:50.933
What stinks
in here, man?

07:50.933 --> 07:53.067
Oh yeah,
it's your campaign.

07:53.067 --> 07:54.467
You died out there.

07:54.467 --> 07:56.633
I mean, that assembly was like
this, boom, this!

07:56.633 --> 07:57.767
You're the boom.

07:57.767 --> 07:58.767
[thud]

07:58.767 --> 08:00.800
No matter how hard I try

08:00.800 --> 08:03.067
to live up
to the real Abe Lincoln,

08:03.067 --> 08:04.400
I always fail.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.400
Hey, don't worry,
man.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.867
Your problems
are answered.

08:06.867 --> 08:09.233
See, I met these really cool
guys after the assembly

08:09.233 --> 08:10.600
that will so get you.

08:10.600 --> 08:11.833
Guys, come on
in here, man!

08:11.833 --> 08:12.867
[screams]

08:12.867 --> 08:14.600
X-Stream Blu
in the hizz-ouse!

08:14.600 --> 08:16.900
Flip an ollie and turn it up!

08:16.900 --> 08:18.367
Lincoln and X-Stream Blu

08:18.367 --> 08:20.500
will literally crunch
the googly to the max!

08:20.500 --> 08:22.800
(all)
Hot sauce!

08:22.800 --> 08:24.800
See, they want
to sponsor your campaign.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.267
And all you gotta do
is abandon your values

08:27.267 --> 08:28.633
and promote
their product

08:28.633 --> 08:31.267
by doing some dangerous, extreme
sports-related stunts.

08:31.267 --> 08:33.333
Just sign this legit-ass
contract!

08:33.333 --> 08:35.167
And totally initial
article seven.

08:35.167 --> 08:38.100
My son won't even look me
in the eye anymore!

08:39.200 --> 08:41.300
Wait, what about
the issues, Abe?

08:41.300 --> 08:43.433
What about the carpet
in the library?

08:43.433 --> 08:45.433
[mocking]
Ooh, Abe's big choice.

08:45.433 --> 08:46.533
Ooh,
I wonder what it'll be.

08:46.533 --> 08:48.600
I'm so worried, ooh.

08:49.667 --> 08:50.667
[TV clicks on]

08:58.300 --> 09:00.300
Maybe I can help,
slice dog!

09:00.300 --> 09:01.667
Blushie!

09:01.667 --> 09:03.433
But I'm no match
for that gang of snow sharks.

09:03.433 --> 09:04.700
Don't worry, bro!

09:04.700 --> 09:07.067
Blushie gonna
stream it hardcore!

09:07.067 --> 09:08.400
[squishes]

09:08.400 --> 09:09.767
No way!

09:09.767 --> 09:12.733
Hop on,

09:17.233 --> 09:18.400
Hey!

09:18.400 --> 09:21.133
Let's go surf
the Internet!

09:21.133 --> 09:23.100
What should we do
with all this X-Stream Blu?

09:23.100 --> 09:24.800
(Abraham and Blushie)
Spray it in your face

09:24.800 --> 09:26.467
and slam it!

09:28.167 --> 09:29.167
[TV clicks off]

09:29.167 --> 09:30.367
You think
it's too much?

09:30.367 --> 09:31.500
[inhales]

09:31.500 --> 09:32.533
(Gandhi)
Abe, I just polled everyone

09:32.533 --> 09:34.633
in the girls' bathroom.

09:34.633 --> 09:35.967
You're ahead!

09:35.967 --> 09:38.067
I knew the poll--
did you say I was winning?

09:38.067 --> 09:39.233
Straight up,
man.

09:39.233 --> 09:40.700
Numbers don't lie.

09:40.700 --> 09:41.733
I'm the number five.

09:43.433 --> 09:45.233
Cleo, why are
you crying?

09:45.233 --> 09:48.067
[sobbing]
I just don't think

09:48.067 --> 09:50.067
things are going
to work out with JFK.

09:50.067 --> 09:51.067
[sighs]

09:51.067 --> 09:53.067
[whispering]
Wah-hoo.

09:53.067 --> 09:54.467
I am so sorry.

09:54.467 --> 09:56.300
I need someone
to comfort me.

09:56.300 --> 09:58.533
Someone who's
leading the polls

09:58.533 --> 10:00.600
and is named Abe.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.167
Wait,
you're named Abe.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.267
Aren't you,
Abe?

10:04.267 --> 10:06.100
To the max,
Cleo.

10:06.100 --> 10:07.667
To the max.

10:07.667 --> 10:09.233
That's it.

10:09.233 --> 10:12.200
All of the pictures I have of
him over my bed are coming down.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.700
Except for that one
where he's under the tree

10:14.700 --> 10:16.767
with his shirt off.

10:16.767 --> 10:18.767
[moans]

10:18.767 --> 10:21.267
We're rich, Mr. B!

10:21.267 --> 10:22.700
Bling, bling.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.200
But shouldn't you be saving
some of this money

10:25.200 --> 10:28.033
for your secret plan instead
of having me gold plated

10:28.033 --> 10:29.933
and lowered?

10:29.933 --> 10:31.900
Don't get all up in my business,

10:31.900 --> 10:34.300
my hydraulically outfitted
friend.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.067
Why, I watched the first 2/3

10:36.067 --> 10:37.967
of the MC Hammer
Behind the Music.

10:37.967 --> 10:40.000
And if there's one thing
I've learned about money,

10:40.000 --> 10:43.367
it's that it never runs out.

10:43.367 --> 10:47.267
(JFK)
Hey, gay foster dads.

10:47.267 --> 10:49.767
How do I get everyone
to like me?

10:49.767 --> 10:53.467
Baby, a lot of people
liked the original JFK

10:53.467 --> 10:55.167
because he was
such a caring leader

10:55.167 --> 10:57.600
and he inspired
a generation of young people.

10:57.600 --> 11:01.367
I thought he was
a macho womanizing stud

11:01.367 --> 11:03.100
who conquered the moon.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.600
[knocking on door]

11:04.600 --> 11:07.200
Hark, that sounds
like the gentle knock

11:07.200 --> 11:09.667
of a vulnerable teenage girl.

11:09.667 --> 11:10.667
[door creaks]

11:10.667 --> 11:11.967
*

11:11.967 --> 11:13.200
You're wet.

11:13.200 --> 11:16.333
Allow me
to dry you off...

11:16.333 --> 11:17.667
with my pants!

11:17.667 --> 11:19.233
I want to manage
your campaign.

11:19.233 --> 11:21.067
Hey,
whatever you're into.

11:21.067 --> 11:23.133
Dads,
I'm gonna be busy

11:23.133 --> 11:25.667
nailing this kinky broad
for the next 15 minutes.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.467
Would you shut up?

11:27.467 --> 11:30.167
I'm here because I can't stand
Abe being Cleo's puppet

11:30.167 --> 11:32.067
and you can't win the election
without my help.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.333
Here's what
we're gonna do...

11:34.333 --> 11:36.300
[inaudible whispering]

11:36.300 --> 11:37.667
And then...

11:37.667 --> 11:39.500
[inaudible whispering]

11:39.500 --> 11:40.500
Well how about...

11:40.500 --> 11:41.500
[inaudible whispering]

11:41.500 --> 11:42.767
Dental dam...

Bobby!

11:45.300 --> 11:47.667
Okay,
no dental dam.

11:47.667 --> 11:51.167
Folks, for my next totally
outrageous campaign stunt,

11:51.167 --> 11:53.767
I will ride this wind surfboard,

11:53.767 --> 11:56.300
which is connected
by a bungee cord

11:56.300 --> 11:58.167
to this monster truck,

11:58.167 --> 12:00.500
which my friend Gandhi
will drive back and forth

12:00.500 --> 12:02.467
on this half-pipe,

12:02.467 --> 12:04.767
just like the real Abe Lincoln
would've done,

12:04.767 --> 12:06.767
had he the tools to do so.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.067
[engine revs]

12:08.067 --> 12:09.133
[engine roars]

12:09.133 --> 12:10.067
[metal clangs]

12:11.133 --> 12:13.433

12:13.433 --> 12:14.967
Hey everybody,

12:14.967 --> 12:18.500
something is on
the closed-circuit TV.

12:18.500 --> 12:22.300
[cheering]

12:22.300 --> 12:23.967
(announcer)
Abraham Lincoln.

12:23.967 --> 12:25.500
Honest Abe.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.667
Or so he'd have you believe.

12:27.667 --> 12:30.800
Last year, Abe said
he was 15 years old.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.433
Now he claims to be 16.

12:33.433 --> 12:34.900
Which is it, Abe?

12:34.900 --> 12:36.467
Better keep your story straight.

12:36.467 --> 12:38.100
[baby cries]

12:38.100 --> 12:40.067
He'd also like you to believe
he's not a baby eater.

12:40.067 --> 12:42.567
But he's never gone on record
saying he isn't.

12:42.567 --> 12:45.400
Maybe he's too busy
eating babies.

12:45.400 --> 12:46.700
I can't wait to eat this--

12:46.700 --> 12:47.700
[tape whines]

12:47.700 --> 12:49.067

12:52.833 --> 12:54.567

When is it gonna stop, Abe?

12:54.567 --> 12:56.733
Not voting for Abe:

12:56.733 --> 12:58.733
it just makes sense.

12:58.733 --> 13:01.767
How did JFK get
my spaghetti video?

13:04.700 --> 13:07.067
[dramatic music]

13:07.067 --> 13:09.567
[whooshing]

13:09.567 --> 13:11.733
Hey, turn that frown
upside down, Abe.

13:11.733 --> 13:12.833
[squish]

13:12.833 --> 13:14.633
At least it can't
get any worse.

13:14.633 --> 13:16.800
How many times have
I told you not to say that?

13:16.800 --> 13:18.733
Now something worse
is gonna happen,

13:18.733 --> 13:20.333
I've seen it
on Happy Days, watch:

13:20.333 --> 13:21.333
In three,

13:21.333 --> 13:22.333
two,

13:22.333 --> 13:23.333
one.

13:23.333 --> 13:24.800
Abe.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.467
I'm really confused about
my feelings right now.

13:27.467 --> 13:29.333
I think I just...

13:29.333 --> 13:30.700
need some time
to be alone...

13:30.700 --> 13:32.267
*

13:32.267 --> 13:33.300
with JFK.

13:34.800 --> 13:35.900
Wait.

13:35.900 --> 13:37.700
At least it can't
get any better.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.333
It doesn't work
that way, Gandhi.

13:40.667 --> 13:43.300
[fluttering]

13:44.933 --> 13:49.200
(female singer)
* The heart in my mind
has been hoping *

13:49.200 --> 13:50.900
*

13:50.900 --> 13:56.200
* And the mind in my heart
has been wishing *

13:56.200 --> 13:57.733
*

13:57.733 --> 13:58.733
Abe?

13:58.733 --> 14:00.267
What are you
doing here?

14:00.267 --> 14:02.667
I come out here
to think sometimes.

14:02.667 --> 14:03.900
Me too.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.467
Well, right now all
I can think about

14:05.467 --> 14:07.633
is not thinking about you over
there on your thinking dock

14:07.633 --> 14:08.900
thinking about
what you did.

14:08.900 --> 14:11.067
I was only trying
to help, Abe.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.767
You don't know
what you're getting into.

14:12.767 --> 14:14.567
What she's
getting you into.

14:14.567 --> 14:16.533
You don't know what
you're getting into.

14:16.533 --> 14:18.867
And that's out of
my friendship.

14:18.867 --> 14:21.067
And you know what
hurts the most, Joan?

14:21.067 --> 14:22.400
This nail I just
stepped on.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.733
[ding]

14:23.733 --> 14:25.733
But there's a metaphorical nail
in my other foot

14:25.733 --> 14:26.933
that hurts the second most,

14:26.933 --> 14:28.667
and it's from you
backstabbing me.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.533
So, maybe instead of
the nail metaphor,

14:30.533 --> 14:32.300
I should've used
a stabbing metaphor,

14:32.300 --> 14:33.967
but it's too late for that now,
isn't it?

14:33.967 --> 14:35.367
I guess it is.

14:35.367 --> 14:37.600
That's where you're wrong, Joan.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.067
Because I'm gonna win
that election

14:39.067 --> 14:40.767
with the most
dangerous campaign stunt

14:40.767 --> 14:43.267
since Dukakis jumped
the Snake River Canyon.

14:43.267 --> 14:45.667
Goodbye, Joan.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.200

I can't see

15:50.133 --> 15:51.900

Next question is for JFK.

15:51.900 --> 15:54.067
How do you respond
to the criticism that,

15:54.067 --> 15:55.833
unlike Abe and myself,

15:55.833 --> 15:57.733
you won't put yourself
at risk of physical harm

15:57.733 --> 15:59.133
in order to gain approval?

15:59.133 --> 16:03.367
That is a good question,
scary androgynous white guy.

16:03.367 --> 16:07.067
And I would like to reply
by taking my shirt off.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.400
[girls screaming]

16:08.400 --> 16:11.200
My bare-chested opponent
raises a good point,

16:11.200 --> 16:13.400
but he's avoiding the fact
that X-Stream Blu

16:13.400 --> 16:15.700
is mad-packed with all nine
essential nutri-mites

16:15.700 --> 16:17.300
to fortify your X-Zone.

16:17.300 --> 16:19.233
(JFK)
May I respond to that?

16:19.233 --> 16:20.233
Yes, you may.

16:20.233 --> 16:21.633
Abe's a tot-muncher.

16:21.633 --> 16:22.967
Oh, yeah?

16:22.967 --> 16:25.500
For my rebuttal,
I'd like to dramatically gesture

16:25.500 --> 16:28.500
to this giant death-defying

Abe, it all
comes down to...

this.

Marilyn Manson?

17:12.500 --> 17:13.833
Yes.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.167
It is my professional opinion
as a rock star

17:16.167 --> 17:17.367
and a licensed doctor,

17:17.367 --> 17:19.067
that this student
is suffering from

17:19.067 --> 17:21.267
malnutrition.

17:21.267 --> 17:23.500
Mena, I'm going to need
one milligram

17:23.500 --> 17:26.833
of sub-q glucagon, stat.

this be?

17:33.200 --> 17:35.100
What have I done?

17:36.667 --> 17:39.667
Fellow students,
X-Stream Blu is a sham.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.167
For four days straight,

17:41.167 --> 17:43.433
Gandhi ate nothing
but pancake batter

17:43.433 --> 17:44.800
and blue house paint.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.967
A shallow ploy by
Racist Mammy Breakfast Foods

17:47.967 --> 17:50.800
to jazz up an old product
with extreme marketing,

17:50.800 --> 17:54.400
the same marketing scheme
I used to win your votes.

Well, I don't deserve
your votes.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.567
Wait, everyone.

18:12.567 --> 18:14.267
You should vote for Abe,

18:14.267 --> 18:16.733
because a real leader does
what Abe just did,

18:16.733 --> 18:18.100
and what he always does.

18:18.100 --> 18:19.933
He stands up for
the right thing

18:19.933 --> 18:22.700
even if it makes him
look like a jackass.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.433
That's the kind of jackass
I want in my corner.

Looks like Lincoln
is your new president.

18:39.633 --> 18:42.100
You're gonna make
a great-ass president.

18:42.100 --> 18:43.500
Thanks, Joan,

18:43.500 --> 18:46.167
for showing me how
to be a real-ass leader.

Hey, check out
that stray puppy.

he is so cute.

And it's licking
that dead Smurf's face.

Aww.

Fine, whatever.

This random dog
is your new president.

Well, we sure learned
a lot today.

19:09.467 --> 19:11.100
I'll say.

19:11.100 --> 19:14.133
But there's just one thing
I don't understand, Dr. Manson.

19:14.133 --> 19:18.067
How does a growing boy like me
eat a healthy, balanced diet?

19:18.067 --> 19:19.733
Well, Gandhi,
I'll tell you

19:19.733 --> 19:22.800
the only way
I know how.

19:22.800 --> 19:27.533
* The ancient pharaohs were not
too bright, they say *

19:27.533 --> 19:30.333
* But they made
one contribution *

19:30.333 --> 19:33.300
* That I live by to this day

19:33.300 --> 19:35.733
* It's the food pyramid *

19:35.733 --> 19:38.367
* And it's approved
by the USDA *

*

19:42.600 --> 19:44.467

are the foundation *

19:44.467 --> 19:46.500
* So please take my advice

19:46.500 --> 19:50.700
* Have 5 to 11 servings
of bread, cereal, or rice *

19:50.700 --> 19:52.567
* 3 to 5 of vegetables

19:52.567 --> 19:54.400
* And four of fruits is best

19:54.400 --> 19:58.300
* Their antioxidants and fiber
help you to digest *

19:58.300 --> 20:02.767
* Three servings
of yogurt, milk, and cheese *

20:02.767 --> 20:03.900
* Will help your bones

20:03.900 --> 20:06.900
* And subsidize
the cattle industries *

**

20:08.633 --> 20:10.633
* A body needs to grow

20:10.633 --> 20:12.400
* And growing takes proteins

20:12.400 --> 20:14.667
* That's why meat
can be a tasty treat *

20:14.667 --> 20:16.400
* Like fish or human beings

[chomps]

20:17.400 --> 20:18.933
* When you eat your sweets

20:18.933 --> 20:20.633

20:20.633 --> 20:23.167
* To limit your servings

* Or you'll *

did learn that.

* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *
