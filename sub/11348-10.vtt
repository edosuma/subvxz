00:02.236 --> 00:02.436

00:02.470 --> 00:03.304
announcer:
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:04.505 --> 00:07.241
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.277
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:09.310 --> 00:11.112
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:11.145 --> 00:12.513
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:12.546 --> 00:14.582
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.317
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.487
- IT'S A BRAVE NEW WORLD.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.489
SINCE CRIMINALS ARE BOUND
LESS AND LESS

00:21.522 --> 00:24.225
BY GEOGRAPHICAL JURISDICTION,

00:24.258 --> 00:26.794
LAW ENFORCEMENT
MUST FOLLOW SUIT.

00:26.827 --> 00:30.131
WE ALL NEED TO SHARE INFORMATION
QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.565
CASE IN POINT:

00:31.599 --> 00:34.602
THE RECENT PATTERN 17 RAPE CASE
IN NEW YORK.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.237
NOW, FOR US AT APD,

00:36.270 --> 00:38.672
THE MOST GRATIFYING PART
OF CLOSING OUT THAT CASE

00:38.706 --> 00:42.410
WAS COLLABORATING WITH OUR
ESTEEMED AND CHARMING COLLEAGUES

00:42.443 --> 00:44.412
AT NYPD.

00:44.445 --> 00:47.381
NOW, ONE OF SERGEANT BENSON'S
DETECTIVES,

00:47.415 --> 00:49.217
FORMERLY ONE OF MY OWN,

00:49.250 --> 00:51.419
RECALLED A FEW COLD CASES
IN ATLANTA

00:51.452 --> 00:54.122
THAT MATCHED THE PROFILE
THAT THEY HAD ESTABLISHED.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.557
NOW, GIVEN THE SIMILARITIES
IN THE M.O.,

00:56.590 --> 01:02.330
WE FELT CERTAIN THAT DNA ON FILE
IN OUR PRECINCT WOULD PROVE

01:02.363 --> 01:04.598
THAT THIS WAS THE WORK
OF ONE MAN,

01:04.632 --> 01:10.471
DNA THEY WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN
FROM THE NEW YORK CRIME SCENE.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.373
- HE SITS ON THE RAPE KITS
FOR SIX YEARS,

01:12.406 --> 01:13.474
WE CATCH THE GUY,

01:13.507 --> 01:14.842
AND HE TAKES THE VICTORY LAP?

01:14.875 --> 01:16.644
- ACCEPT THE THINGS
YOU CANNOT CHANGE.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.313
- JUST DON'T ASK ME
TO GO OUT TO DINNER WITH HIM.

01:19.347 --> 01:22.183
- SERGEANT, BEAUTIFUL CITY
YOU HAVE HERE.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.551
- EVEN WHEN IT ISN'T.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.619
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.221
SPEAKING OF BEAUTIFUL,

01:27.255 --> 01:30.758
AMANDA, IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.193
[breathes deeply]

01:32.226 --> 01:34.195
BROKE MY HEART
TO LET THIS ONE GO.

01:34.228 --> 01:35.663
Y'ALL HAVE A WINNER WITH HER.

01:35.696 --> 01:36.697
- WE KNOW THAT.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.699
- OH, FORGIVE ME, DARLING.

01:38.732 --> 01:41.335
FOLKS, THIS IS
DETECTIVE REESE TAYMOR.

01:41.369 --> 01:42.736
THIS IS HER FIRST CONFERENCE.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.472
- OH, WELL, WELCOME TO NEW YORK.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.806
- OH, JUST LIKE THE SONG.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.375
I LOVED YOUR PRESENTATION

01:47.408 --> 01:49.410
ON AGGREGATING
AND HOT-PLATING SOCIAL MEDIA

01:49.443 --> 01:51.379
TO REALLY ZERO IN
ON A CRIME SCENE OR PATTERN.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.581
WE SHOULD LOOK INTO SOME
OF THE PROGRAMS SHE MENTIONED--

01:53.614 --> 01:55.249
SNAPTRENDS, GRAMFEED.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.785
- YEAH, WELL,
ANYTHING YOU WANT, DARLING.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.654
GOSH, YOU KNOW,
SO MANY FRIENDS HERE.

02:00.688 --> 02:01.889
WE'LL CATCH YOU LATER.

02:01.922 --> 02:02.890
- IT WAS NICE TO MEET Y'ALL.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.124
- YOU TOO.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.761
- YEAH, ATLANTA,
THEY'RE SO POLITE.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.463
- SAM REYNOLDS,
ROLLINS' OLD CAPTAIN,

02:09.497 --> 02:11.632
WANTS US TO JOIN APD AT MORAN'S.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.634
- I'M OUT OF HERE.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.203
- I GOT TO GO HOME
TO NOAH, GUYS.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.304
GOODNIGHT.

02:16.337 --> 02:17.938
- WELL, IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.274
- I'M NOT GOOD AT HANGING OUT
WITH THE GOOD OL' BOYS.

02:20.308 --> 02:21.709
- WELL, HE SAID REESE
WAS COMING.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.678
- UM...YOU KNOW WHAT,
I GOT TO WALK FRANNIE.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.166
- HIT ME.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.873
- THOSE ATLANTA BOYS
CAN PUT IT AWAY.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.408
WHEN I LEFT, THEY WERE STILL
GETTING AFTER IT.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.310
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY MADE IT
BACK TO THEIR HOTEL.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.545
- YOU WENT?
- YEAH.

02:57.578 --> 02:58.812
- ROLLINS STUCK YOU WITH THEM?

02:58.846 --> 02:59.980
- YEAH.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.915
HEY...

03:01.949 --> 03:04.318
WHAT'S HER DEAL WITH THESE GUYS?

03:04.352 --> 03:05.786
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
ASK HER.

03:05.819 --> 03:06.954
[phone ringing]

03:06.987 --> 03:07.955
SVU.

03:07.988 --> 03:08.922
- IS LIV ALREADY IN?

03:08.956 --> 03:10.358
- YEAH.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.659
I TOLD HER YOU WERE
RUNNING LATE.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.327
- THANKS.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.595
- OKAY, BAD NEWS.

03:14.628 --> 03:15.663
- WHAT?

03:15.696 --> 03:17.698
- HOTEL RAPE LAST NIGHT.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.768
AND THE VIC IS THAT YOUNG
DETECTIVE FROM ATLANTA.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.841
- SHE PRESENTED
WITH A SERIOUS HEAD WOUND,

03:27.875 --> 03:29.377
SAID SHE FELL IN THE BATHROOM.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.279
- SO SHE WAS FOUND
IN HER OWN HOTEL ROOM?

03:31.312 --> 03:32.413
- BY THE MAID.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.348
SECURITY CALLED 911.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.749
SHE DISCLOSED THE RAPE
TO THE E.R. NURSE,

03:35.783 --> 03:36.950
SO WE RAN A KIT.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.819
- ANY DRUGS OR ALCOHOL
IN HER SYSTEM?

03:38.852 --> 03:40.288
- NO DRUGS.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.456
ALCOHOL LEVELS
WERE HIGH, THOUGH--0.12.

03:42.490 --> 03:44.692
- STILL INTOXICATED
THIS MORNING.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.360
- OKAY, ANY OTHER INJURIES?

03:46.394 --> 03:49.563
- BITE MARKS, SOME BRUISING
ON THE THIGHS AND HIPS.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.432
- SHE SAY WHO HER ASSAILANT WAS?

03:51.465 --> 03:53.634
- THAT'S OUTSIDE MY PURVIEW,
DETECTIVE.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.935
- THANKS.

03:57.771 --> 04:01.342
DETECTIVE TAYMOR,
WE'RE SO SORRY.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.911
SO CAN YOU WALK US
THROUGH THE DETAILS?

04:03.944 --> 04:06.380
- OH, I, UM...

04:06.414 --> 04:08.716
I GUESS I HAD TOO MUCH
TO DRINK AT DINNER.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.018
I-I GOT UP IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT,

04:11.051 --> 04:14.522
WENT TO GO GET A GLASS OF WATER
AND...FELL,

04:14.555 --> 04:17.458
AND MUST HAVE HIT MY HEAD
ON THE SINK.

04:17.491 --> 04:21.895
- WHAT ABOUT THE ASSAULT?

04:21.929 --> 04:25.733
- I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

04:25.766 --> 04:29.002
- OKAY, THE E.R. NURSE
SAID THAT YOU DISCLOSED.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.341
- I DON'T--I WAS--

04:33.374 --> 04:37.845
I WAS IN AN EMOTIONAL PLACE.

04:37.878 --> 04:40.013
- YEAH, I'M VERY SORRY.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.315
FIN NEEDS ME.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.718
- GO AHEAD.

04:47.688 --> 04:50.023
- I FEEL SO STUPID
BRINGING Y'ALL IN HERE.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.692
- OKAY, HOW ABOUT WE--

04:51.725 --> 04:53.861
HOW ABOUT WE START
AT THE BEGINNING?

04:57.365 --> 05:00.000
- WE HAD DRINKS.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.869
HE ESCORTED ME TO MY DOOR.

05:03.704 --> 05:06.374
USED A FALSE PRETENSE TO GET IN.

05:08.075 --> 05:12.012
AND WHEN I TOLD HIM
THAT I NEEDED TO SLEEP, IT...

05:12.045 --> 05:16.617
BECAME SOMETHING ELSE.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.085
[stutters, laughs]

05:18.118 --> 05:20.821
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I'M
SAYING THESE WORDS OUT LOUD.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.055
- OKAY, DID YOU STRUGGLE?

05:22.089 --> 05:23.624
DID YOU SAY NO?

05:23.657 --> 05:25.793
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE
SOME BRUISING.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.367
LISTEN TO ME.

05:33.401 --> 05:34.835
THIS ISN'T GONNA JUST GO AWAY.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.103
- YEAH, IT WILL.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.971
- WE'RE GONNA PULL
THE SECURITY FOOTAGE

05:38.005 --> 05:41.775
AND FIND OUT WHO WENT IN
AND OUT OF THAT HOTEL ROOM.

05:47.781 --> 05:48.749
- IT WAS MY--

05:48.782 --> 05:50.851
IT WAS MY BOSS.

05:50.884 --> 05:51.919
- CAPTAIN REYNOLDS?

05:51.952 --> 05:53.654
- [laughs]

05:53.687 --> 05:55.155
NO, NO.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.392
IT WAS--IT WAS HIS BOSS.

06:00.661 --> 06:03.964
DEPUTY CHIEF PATTON.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.033
SO, YOU SEE, I'M NOT
PRESSING ANY CHARGES,

06:06.066 --> 06:08.636
AND I WON'T TESTIFY.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.671
I CAN'T.

06:19.580 --> 06:22.550
[dramatic music]

07:07.194 --> 07:07.595
.

07:07.628 --> 07:08.395
- A DETECTIVE ASSAULTED
IS BAD ENOUGH,

07:09.062 --> 07:10.130
BUT SHE'S ACCUSING HER CHIEF.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.732
OH, I MISS HOMICIDE.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.200
A LOT LESS LOADED.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.503
- I ASSUMED THAT YOU'D WANT
A HEADS UP.

07:15.536 --> 07:18.672
SO THE RAPE KIT SHOWS BRUISING
AND BITE MARKS, SEMEN.

07:18.706 --> 07:21.141
HER BLOOD-ALCOHOL WAS...HIGH.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.476
- ALWAYS IS.

07:22.510 --> 07:23.777
WE DID DUE DILIGENCE
AT THE HOTEL?

07:23.811 --> 07:26.246
- YEAH, PATTON WAS STAYING
IN AN ADJOINING SUITE.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.682
SECURITY FOOTAGE SAW THEM
ENTERING HER ROOM

07:28.716 --> 07:30.117
FROM THE HALLWAY AT 1:00 A.M.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.919
- AND THEN A MALE VOICE
ORDERS ROOM SERVICE

07:31.952 --> 07:33.621
TEN MINUTES LATER.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.724
SECURITY FOOTAGE CAUGHT PATTON
LEAVING HIS ROOM AT 6:00 A.M.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.626
- AND HOUSEKEEPING FINDS REESE

07:38.659 --> 07:40.694
UNCONSCIOUS
ON HER BATHROOM FLOOR.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.763
SHE SAID SHE SLIPPED AND FELL.

07:42.796 --> 07:43.764
THAT WAS AT 8:00 A.M.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.165
- SHE ADMITS TO INVITING HIM IN?

07:45.198 --> 07:48.168
- NOT SO MUCH INVITING
AS ALLOWING.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.770
I MEAN, HE'S HER
SUPERIOR OFFICER.

07:49.803 --> 07:50.904
IT'S PRETTY TOUGH TO SAY NO.

07:50.938 --> 07:54.207
- OR A MAN AND A WOMAN
OUT OF TOWN HAVE A FEW DRINKS.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.777
THEY DO SOMETHING
THEY MIGHT NOT DO AT HOME.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.547
BRUISING, BITE MARKS--
NOT INCONSISTENT WITH DRUNK SEX.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.715
- OR RAPE.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.584
- ROLLINS WORKED FOR THIS GUY?

08:07.855 --> 08:08.756
- HEY, YOU KNOW PATTON.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.524
IS HE GOOD FOR THIS?

08:12.760 --> 08:16.163
DETECTIVE TAYMOR,
DOES SHE SEEM CREDIBLE?

08:16.196 --> 08:18.732
- I ACTUALLY WASN'T THERE
FOR HER DISCLOSURE.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.769
- ROLLINS,
DODDS WANTS YOU INSIDE.

08:29.276 --> 08:32.780
- DEPUTY CHIEF PATTON WAS MY
SUPERIOR OFFICER FOR SIX YEARS.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.748
HE'S SMART, POLITICAL.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.850
- YOU KNOW THE TYPE.

08:36.884 --> 08:37.951
- AND PERSONALLY?

08:37.985 --> 08:40.988
YOU KNOW, ANY RUMORS
OF HARASSMENT OR SKIRT-CHASING?

08:41.021 --> 08:42.823
- HE'S BEEN MARRIED 20 YEARS.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.792
- I DIDN'T SEE HIS WIFE
AT THE CONVENTION.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.127
- DETECTIVE TAYMOR
WOULDN'T DISCLOSE

08:47.160 --> 08:48.629
UNTIL YOU LEFT THE ROOM.

08:48.662 --> 08:51.699
NOW, HAVE YOU HEARD ANY WHISPERS

08:51.732 --> 08:52.666
ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP?

08:52.700 --> 08:54.802
- AS FAR AS I KNOW,
THEY JUST WORK TOGETHER.

08:54.835 --> 08:57.237
- IN ADJOINING ROOMS.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.172
- I'M NOT PRIVY
TO HIS PERSONAL LIFE.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.841
- WE'RE ALL GROWN-UPS HERE.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.076
WE KNOW THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN INFIDELITY AND ASSAULT.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.812
I'M ASKING IF...

09:04.845 --> 09:08.081
PATTON IS CAPABLE
OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

09:08.115 --> 09:11.118
- YOU CAN NEVER TELL
WHO'S CAPABLE OF WHAT.

09:12.820 --> 09:13.954
- THANK YOU, ROLLINS.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.222
FIN.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.862
SHE'S IN AN AWKWARD
POSITION HERE.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.231
I'M SURE SHE STILL
FEELS LOYAL TO HIM.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.298
- AS SHOULD WE.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.867
HE IS A FELLOW OFFICER.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.769
- SO IS DETECTIVE TAYMOR.

09:28.802 --> 09:29.770
HE OUTRANKS HER, BUT--

09:29.803 --> 09:31.605
- WE HAVEN'T HEARD HIS SIDE YET.

09:31.639 --> 09:32.740
- OKAY.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.274
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO WATCH THE INTERVIEW?

09:34.307 --> 09:36.810
- NO, I'LL TAKE IT.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.852
- CHIEF DODDS,
I HEAR GOOD THINGS.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.153
- LIKEWISE.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.155
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.857
- SO...

09:49.890 --> 09:51.759
HERE WE ARE, IN THE BOX.

09:51.792 --> 09:52.726
- NO DISRESPECT.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.696
IT'S JUST...THE OPTICS.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.799
- SO...

09:58.832 --> 10:02.202
WE ARE IN A SITUATION.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.304
SO LET ME GET RIGHT TO IT.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.707
I AM NOT PROUD OF THIS,

10:06.740 --> 10:09.042
AND I LOVE MY WIFE.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.679
BUT THAT GIRL AND I ARE--

10:11.712 --> 10:14.882
WELL...WERE INVOLVED.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.416
- AND YOU WERE IN HER ROOM
LAST NIGHT.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.352
- YEAH, I MEAN, WE HAD SEX.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.288
CONSENSUAL, OBVIOUSLY.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.422
YEAH, SHE'D HAD A FEW DRINKS.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.724
- SURE.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.759
HERE'S OUR ISSUE.

10:25.793 --> 10:28.195
SHE'S SAYING
IT WASN'T CONSENSUAL.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.897
- AH.

10:29.930 --> 10:30.898
[chuckles]

10:30.931 --> 10:32.365
WELL, NOW...

10:32.399 --> 10:33.901
I KIND OF DEDUCED THAT.

10:33.934 --> 10:34.935
- YOU KNOW HOW THESE THINGS GO,

10:34.968 --> 10:37.671
THE "HE SAID, SHE SAID."

10:37.705 --> 10:39.673
I JUST NEED A REASON.

10:39.707 --> 10:41.809
WHY DID SHE ACCUSE YOU
LIKE THAT?

10:41.842 --> 10:45.278
- DODDS WITH
THE GOOD OL' BOY ROUTINE.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.847
- HE'S PRETTY GOOD.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.215
- SO IS PATTON.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.751
- SHE STARTED SPEWING
ALL THIS NONSENSE

10:50.784 --> 10:52.452
ABOUT ME LEAVING MY WIFE.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.721
- AH, OKAY.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.455
- REESE IS A SMART GIRL.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.691
AND SHE'S A DAMN FINE DETECTIVE.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.359
BUT YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.894
HELL HATH NO FURY.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.864
- SO THIS IS HER
NOT HEARING WHAT SHE WANTED

11:03.897 --> 11:05.232
AND GETTING PAYBACK.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.900
- THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

11:06.934 --> 11:09.302
I BET THIS WHOLE THING
GOES AWAY NOW.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.739
- OH, YOU KNOW
I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.708
- WELL, HOW ABOUT I TALK TO HER?

11:14.742 --> 11:16.944
- YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT'S AGAINST PROTOCOL.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.349
- IS THIS A SETUP, CHIEF DODDS?

11:22.382 --> 11:25.919
YOU INVITE ME IN HERE,
ALL SMILES AND GOODWILL.

11:25.953 --> 11:29.222
YOU KNOW, THAT FELLOW OFFICER
COURTESY BULL CRAP.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.257
- IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

11:30.290 --> 11:31.892
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

11:34.461 --> 11:37.430
I THINK AMANDA ROLLINS

11:37.464 --> 11:39.733
PUT HER AND YOU ALL UP TO THIS.

11:39.767 --> 11:40.834
- EXCUSE ME?

11:40.868 --> 11:42.269
- WELL, NOW...

11:42.302 --> 11:45.806
NO, I'D LIKE
TO BE THE GENTLEMAN HERE,

11:45.839 --> 11:48.175
BUT THAT ONE
HAS AN AXE TO GRIND.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.311
I MEAN, THERE'S REASONS
WHY SHE LEFT ATLANTA.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.313
- I'M NEW TO SVU.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.782
TELL ME.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.852
- WELL...

11:58.886 --> 12:00.353
SHE GOT AROUND.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.156
YOU ASK HER ABOUT THE TIME

12:03.190 --> 12:05.492
SHE THREW HERSELF AT ME
TO SAVE HER SISTER.

12:05.525 --> 12:09.763
OFFERED ME THINGS
THAT MADE MY EYES WATER.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.832
OH, SHE NEVER DID LET GO
OF THAT ONE.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.537
AH...

12:17.570 --> 12:19.840
THANK YOU FOR THE HOSPITALITY.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.342
BUT I AM THE DEPUTY CHIEF
OF THE ATLANTA P.D.,

12:22.375 --> 12:25.278
AND I HAVE SOME BUSINESS
TO ATTEND TO BACK HOME.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.313
- I HEAR YOU.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.447
AS FAR AS LEAVING TOWN,

12:27.480 --> 12:29.817
I THINK THE NEW YORK PRESS
MIGHT CATCH WIND OF THAT.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.152
THEY'D MAKE MINCED MEAT
OUT OF YOU.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.553
YOUR CAREER, YOUR MARRIAGE.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.455
I'D HATE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.057
- YEAH, WELL...

12:37.090 --> 12:39.359
WE BOTH KNOW THE NEXT TIME
WE HAVE A CONVERSATION,

12:39.392 --> 12:41.962
MY ATTORNEY WILL BE PRESENT.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.331
HAVE YOURSELF A NICE DAY,
ALL RIGHT?

12:44.364 --> 12:46.199
- UGH, SON OF A BITCH.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.935
- NO ONE'S GONNA BUY
A WORD HE SAYS.

12:47.968 --> 12:51.304
- ACTUALLY, BACK HOME,
PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE DOES.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.481
- AMANDA.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.851
- JUST LEAVE ME BE.

13:13.193 --> 13:13.393
.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.194
- YOU'RE A HARD WOMAN
TO TRACK DOWN.

13:15.228 --> 13:19.199
I HAD TO CHECK HALF THE BARS
IN LONG ISLAND CITY.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.071
- I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.874
- I'M NOT LEAVING.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.208
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME

13:28.241 --> 13:31.244
WHAT WENT ON
BETWEEN YOU AND PATTON.

13:37.184 --> 13:40.320
- I WAS PATTON'S
SHINY BLONDE PROTEGE, RIGHT?

13:40.353 --> 13:42.355
I WAS SMART.
I WAS A GOOD GIRL.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.591
JUST HIS TYPE.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.260
AND IT WASN'T--
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT AT FIRST.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.329
- AND THEN?

13:49.362 --> 13:52.599
- AND THEN MY SISTER
GOT ARRESTED.

13:52.632 --> 13:56.203
CHECK FRAUD, WIRE FRAUD,
POSSESSION.

13:56.236 --> 13:59.206
SO PATTON CALLS ME
INTO HIS OFFICE.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.508
IT WAS LATE.
NOBODY WAS AROUND.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.244
AND HE SAID THAT WE
COULD MAKE IT GO AWAY.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.245
- AMANDA.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.414
- IT WAS MY SISTER, FIN.

14:07.447 --> 14:10.117
- DID HE FORCE YOU?

14:10.150 --> 14:12.519
- HE DIDN'T PUT A GUN
TO MY HEAD.

14:12.552 --> 14:15.322
- SO REESE IS TELLING THE TRUTH?

14:15.355 --> 14:17.224
- YEAH.
- WE HAVE TO TELL BARBA.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.092
- NO.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.061
I WON'T SAY I WAS RAPED,
BECAUSE I WASN'T.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.996
- YOU HAVE TO LET HIM KNOW

14:23.030 --> 14:25.265
THIS GUY IS A PREDATOR,
THAT HE'S CAPABLE.

14:25.298 --> 14:28.135
- BUT IF I DO--
PATTON FIGHTS DIRTY, FIN.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.169
- WHAT ABOUT THIS GIRL?

14:29.202 --> 14:31.071
- WELL, SHE'LL GET OVER IT.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.406
I MEAN, SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
SLEEPING WITH HIM ANYHOW.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.407
YOU KNOW?

14:34.441 --> 14:35.442
SHE'LL GO BACK TO ATLANTA,

14:35.475 --> 14:37.610
AND SHE'LL PRETEND
LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.646
- JUST LIKE YOU DID.

14:42.582 --> 14:46.086
- WELL, PRETEND LONG ENOUGH,

14:46.119 --> 14:48.655
AFTER A WHILE,
IT'S LIKE NOTHING DID HAPPEN.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.393
JUST LET IT GO.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.428
OKAY?

14:58.731 --> 15:01.434
- I PUT MYSELF
IN A BAD POSITION,

15:01.468 --> 15:03.503
AND PATTON TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.072
- ARE YOU SAYING HE RAPED YOU?

15:05.105 --> 15:08.075
- I'M SAYING,
OFF THE RECORD,

15:08.108 --> 15:09.977
THAT, BASED ON MY
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE,

15:10.010 --> 15:13.947
I BELIEVE DETECTIVE TAYMOR
IS TELLING THE TRUTH.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.049
- NOW WHAT, COUNSELOR?

15:16.083 --> 15:18.218
- WE ARREST HIM.

15:18.251 --> 15:22.522
A RAPE KIT WITH BRUISING
AND A SPLIT LIP,

15:22.555 --> 15:24.724
A RAPE NURSE
AS AN OUTCRY WITNESS, ME.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.493
- SHE SAID SHE'S NOT
WILLING TO TESTIFY.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.661
- I CAN'T ARREST A DEPUTY CHIEF
WITHOUT A COMPLAINANT.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.131
IF SHE WON'T COME FORWARD,
WE CAN'T MOVE.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.533
- I WILL TALK TO REESE AGAIN.

15:33.566 --> 15:36.469
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:36.503 --> 15:38.505
IT'S MY TURN.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.377
[door opens]

15:44.411 --> 15:46.413
HEY, THANKS FOR SEEING ME.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.680
- HUH...

15:47.714 --> 15:49.216
IF THE CHIEF SENT YOU
TO SHUT ME UP,

15:49.249 --> 15:50.483
IT'S A WASTED TRIP.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.052
I'M ZIPPING MY MOUTH
AND I'M GOING HOME.

15:52.085 --> 15:55.188
- THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.

15:55.222 --> 15:58.225
PATTON RAPED YOU.

15:58.258 --> 16:01.294
AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO COOPERATE WITH US.

16:01.328 --> 16:04.264
IF THIS GOES TO TRIAL,
YOU NEED TO TESTIFY.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.300
- YEAH, BECAUSE YOU WANT JUSTICE
FOR LITTLE OLD ME?

16:07.334 --> 16:08.435
- YES.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.570
- SO EVERYONE AT HOME
CAN KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO ME,

16:10.603 --> 16:11.671
MY HUMILIATION,

16:11.704 --> 16:14.607
AND KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH,
AND CALL ME A SLUT,

16:14.641 --> 16:16.543
JUST LIKE YOU?

16:16.576 --> 16:18.445
I AM NOTHING LIKE YOU.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.579
- BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL.

16:19.612 --> 16:20.747
- YES.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.449
I WORKED HARD TO GET WHERE I AM.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.616
- I KNOW THAT.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.718
I KNOW THAT'S WHY
THIS IS SO HARD,

16:25.752 --> 16:28.321
BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE
IF YOU DO YOUR JOB WELL,

16:28.355 --> 16:29.422
IF YOU WORK TWICE AS HARD
AS THE MEN,

16:29.456 --> 16:32.759
THEN YOU WILL BE SEEN
AS A GOOD DETECTIVE, RIGHT?

16:32.792 --> 16:35.462
BUT CHIEF PATTON, HE'S KING.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.565
THE WAY HE FIGURES IT,
HE'S ENTITLED TO...

16:40.100 --> 16:42.569
- I KNEW HIS REPUTATION,

16:42.602 --> 16:45.805
TO NOT BE THE LAST PERSON
IN THE OFFICE.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.540
WATCH OUT FOR
THE ACCIDENTAL TOUCHES.

16:47.574 --> 16:48.675
HE'D MAKE HIS JOKES,
I'D SMILE,

16:48.708 --> 16:51.211
TELL HIM I WAS FLATTERED
BUT THAT NOTHING WAS HAPPENING.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.313
- WAIT, YOU WEREN'T
HAVING AN AFFAIR?

16:53.346 --> 16:55.215
- NO.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.717
IS THAT WHAT HE IS SAYING?

16:57.750 --> 17:00.120
AND CAPTAIN REYNOLDS
IS BACKING HIM UP ON THAT?

17:00.153 --> 17:01.654
- YEAH, YOU KNOW
GUYS ARE GONNA TALK

17:01.688 --> 17:03.190
WHETHER WE SLEEP WITH THEM
OR NOT.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.658
YOU THINK SAM REYNOLDS
WANTED EVERYBODY TO KNOW

17:05.692 --> 17:07.727
THAT I TURNED HIM DOWN?

17:10.397 --> 17:14.534
YOU THINK YOU'RE CHIEF PATTON'S
FIRST GOOD GIRL?

17:18.305 --> 17:21.574
- SO EVERYTHING THEY SAID
ABOUT YOU...

17:21.608 --> 17:22.842
AND WHY YOU LEFT,

17:22.875 --> 17:25.412
NONE OF THAT IS TRUE?

17:25.445 --> 17:27.447
- NO.

17:30.850 --> 17:33.420
- ONE THING I CAN SAY
ABOUT THIS CITY IS,

17:33.453 --> 17:35.555
I HAVE NOT HAD A BAD MEAL,
NOT ONCE.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.224
- WELL, THERE'S ONE
GOOD THING, THEN.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.591
- AFTERNOON, GENTLEMEN.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.361
- AH, CHIEF DODDS
AND DETECTIVE...

17:41.394 --> 17:42.629
- TUTUOLA.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.564
- NICK, WHAT CAN WE DO
FOR YOU?

17:44.597 --> 17:45.765
- WHY DON'T WE
TAKE THIS OUTSIDE?

17:45.798 --> 17:47.434
- WELL, WHATEVER YOU HAVE
TO SAY TO ME,

17:47.467 --> 17:49.369
YOU CAN SAY
IN FRONT OF MY MEN.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.271
- CHIEF PATTON, WE HAVE
A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST

17:51.304 --> 17:52.439
ON THE CHARGE OF RAPE ONE.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.506
- WHAT?
THAT IS BULL--

17:53.540 --> 17:54.507
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, SAM.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.543
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.412
HERE.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.387
WELL, THEN...

18:07.420 --> 18:08.555
- WE'RE NOT GONNA CUFF YOU.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.290
WE'RE GONNA QUIETLY
WALK OUT OF HERE.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.725
THEN YOU'LL BE PROCESSED
AND ARRAIGNED.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.428
- SAM, YOU KNOW
THAT LAWYER WE MET?

18:15.462 --> 18:18.465
THE BIG GUY?

18:22.235 --> 18:26.673
- YEAH, I HEARD HE WAS OUT
ON HIS OWN RECOGNIZANCE.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.408
I KNOW.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.710
I KNOW, YOU'RE THERE
IF I NEED YOU, NICK.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.580
I JUST WANT
A QUIET NIGHT TONIGHT.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.615
OKAY, THANKS.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.319
OKAY, FRANNIE MAY.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.521
LOOK, IT'S JUST
ME AND YOU TONIGHT.

18:41.554 --> 18:42.655
HEY, COME HERE.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.657
COME HERE.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.659
COME HERE.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.161
GOOD GIRL.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.696
- HEY, AMANDA.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.201
- YOU HAVE A GPS SIGNAL
ON MY ASS?

18:54.234 --> 18:56.236
- I'M A POLICE OFFICER.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.771
- SO YOU GOT APD
TRACK MY CELL.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.840
- JUST TRYING
TO LOOK AFTER YOU, DARLING.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.309
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT?

19:02.342 --> 19:05.645
- I WANT YOU TO THINK
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

19:05.678 --> 19:06.779
WE KNOW YOU GOT TO REESE.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.648
- GOT TO HER?
I TOOK HER STATEMENT.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.250
- YOU ELICITED A STORY.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.619
SHE WAS LOOKING FOR PAYBACK...

19:12.652 --> 19:13.920
JUST LIKE YOU.

19:13.953 --> 19:18.591
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
PASS ANY JUDGMENT HERE, AMANDA.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.693
YOU SLEPT WITH THE CHIEF
TO GET AHEAD,

19:20.727 --> 19:21.694
AND IT BACKFIRED.

19:21.728 --> 19:22.695
THAT'S ON YOU.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.331
- PATTON'S A LIAR.

19:24.364 --> 19:27.634
- HE'S A MAN I KNOW AND TRUST.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.869
LOOK, I KNOW HOW AMBITIOUS
A GIRL YOU ARE.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.704
REESE TOO.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.240
BUT TAKE MY ADVICE,

19:33.273 --> 19:35.275
AND LET SLEEPING DOGS LIE.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.776
- GET THE HELL OFF MY STREET.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.578
- YOU KNOW, ALL THESE YEARS,

19:38.611 --> 19:40.813
YOU'VE BEEN GIVING ME
THE GOOD GIRL ACT,

19:40.847 --> 19:42.415
BUT YOU WERE
JUST KEEPING YOURSELF

19:42.449 --> 19:45.652
WIDE-EYED AND WET
FOR THE BIG BOSS, WEREN'T YOU?

19:45.685 --> 19:48.488
- NO PIECE FOR YOUR
OLD FRIEND SAM?

19:48.521 --> 19:49.722
AH!

19:51.358 --> 19:53.460
YOU BITCH!

19:53.493 --> 19:54.861
I WILL REPORT YOU!

19:54.894 --> 19:55.862
- YEAH, YOU DO THAT.

19:55.895 --> 19:59.232
AND MAKE SURE YOU TELL YOUR WIFE
I SAID HELLO.

20:07.006 --> 20:07.407
.

20:07.440 --> 20:07.707
- ROLLINS!

20:08.808 --> 20:11.411
ROLLINS!

20:11.444 --> 20:13.946
ROLLINS, COME ON,
DON'T MAKE ME HURT MYSELF.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.348
- YOU'RE STALKING ME NOW?

20:15.382 --> 20:16.483
- OKAY, YOU WEREN'T
RETURNING MY CALLS.

20:16.516 --> 20:17.550
- YEAH, I'M NOT TESTIFYING.

20:17.584 --> 20:18.785
- DON'T MAKE ME SUBPOENA YOU.

20:18.818 --> 20:21.288
- NO, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT ME AND PATTON.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.555
PRIOR ACTS ARE INADMISSIBLE,

20:22.589 --> 20:24.023
AND NOTHING REALLY
HAPPENED ANYWAY.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.393
- LOOK, IF I DON'T CALL YOU,
THE DEFENSE WILL.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.628
YOU HEARD PATTON; THEY'RE GONNA
CLAIM YOU'RE OUT FOR REVENGE.

20:28.661 --> 20:29.929
WE'VE GOT TO GET
IN FRONT OF THIS.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.964
- THEY'RE NOT GONNA CALL ME
UP TO THE STAND.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.535
I-I'VE GOT TO GO.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.270
LIV HATES IT WHEN I'M LATE.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.373
- I APPRECIATE YOU
MEETING US, GENTLEMEN.

20:40.407 --> 20:41.674
BEFORE THIS TURNS INTO A CIRCUS,

20:41.708 --> 20:43.643
I THOUGHT WE COULD STEP BACK,

20:43.676 --> 20:46.946
TALK ABOUT A GRACEFUL
EXIT STRATEGY FOR ALL OF US.

20:48.581 --> 20:49.749
- SO TALK.

20:49.782 --> 20:52.485
- DEPUTY CHIEF PATTON HAS
A LONG AND DISTINGUISHED CAREER.

20:52.519 --> 20:54.821
A YEAR FROM NOW,
HE REACHES MANDATORY RETIREMENT.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.023
- SO, IN EXCHANGE
FOR DROPPING A RAPE CHARGE,

20:57.056 --> 20:59.058
THE DEPUTY CHIEF WILL RETIRE

20:59.091 --> 21:01.661
ONCE HE HITS
MANDATORY RETIREMENT.

21:01.694 --> 21:04.030
I'M HERE AS A COURTESY
TO ATLANTA P.D.,

21:04.063 --> 21:05.798
BUT NYPD WON'T BEND OVER

21:05.832 --> 21:06.999
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
A BROTHER OFFICER.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.735
- BEND OVER?

21:08.768 --> 21:11.538
IS THAT NYPD'S IDEA
OF PROFESSIONAL DECORUM?

21:11.571 --> 21:14.507
- FELLAS, THIS IS WHY
YOU HAVE LAWYERS.

21:14.541 --> 21:16.042
AND LAWYER TO LAWYER,
WE BOTH KNOW

21:16.075 --> 21:18.611
THIS CASE IS AT LEAST
50 SHADES OF GRAY.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.513
- I KNOW DETECTIVE TAYMOR
WAS RAPED.

21:20.547 --> 21:21.481
- [scoffs]

21:21.514 --> 21:22.415
- NEITHER OF US WAS THERE.

21:22.449 --> 21:23.983
THE ONLY VIDEO WE HAVE
IS IN THE HALLWAY,

21:24.016 --> 21:26.586
WHERE AN AMBITIOUS
AND TIPSY YOUNG LADY

21:26.619 --> 21:29.456
INVITES MY CLIENT
INTO HER HOTEL ROOM.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.358
THE REST IS SPECULATION.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.525
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

21:32.559 --> 21:35.061
- I DON'T SEE AN UPSIDE
FOR ANYONE HERE.

21:35.094 --> 21:38.565
MY CLIENT HAS SUFFERED
AN EMBARRASSING PUBLIC ARREST.

21:38.598 --> 21:39.932
- NO CUFFS, LOW-KEY.

21:39.966 --> 21:40.867
WE DID IT RIGHT.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.702
- YEAH, TELL THAT
TO MY WIFE AND FAMILY.

21:42.735 --> 21:43.636
- I IMAGINE YOU HAVE

21:43.670 --> 21:45.472
SOME DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS
AHEAD OF YOU

21:45.505 --> 21:46.839
WITHOUT MY TALKING TO THEM.

21:46.873 --> 21:48.475
- WE'RE NOT DISMISSING.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.042
- WHAT THIS FEELS LIKE,
MORE THAN ANYTHING,

21:50.076 --> 21:52.745
IS DISORDERLY CONDUCT.

21:52.779 --> 21:56.015
DISCIPLINARY ACTION WILL BE
HANDLED BY APD ADMINISTRATIVELY.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.350
- RAPE IS A FELONY CHARGE.

21:57.384 --> 21:59.586
WE'LL ACCEPT SEX ABUSE III,
MINIMUM.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.588
- Y'ALL MIGHT WANT TO THINK
ABOUT WHAT'LL HAPPEN

22:01.621 --> 22:03.556
THE NEXT TIME
A NEW YORK DETECTIVE

22:03.590 --> 22:04.957
GETS IN TROUBLE IN ATLANTA.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.559
- WHAT YOU OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT

22:06.593 --> 22:08.628
IS HOW QUICKLY
THE SHINE GOES OFF YOUR SHIELD

22:08.661 --> 22:10.463
ONCE YOU GO ON THE REGISTRY.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.931
- REGISTRY?

22:11.964 --> 22:13.065
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU

22:13.099 --> 22:15.902
OR YOUR LITTLE
SPANISH DANDY HERE,

22:15.935 --> 22:17.937
BUT I'M STRAIGHT AS AN AXE.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.373
THAT GIRL GOT WHAT SHE WANTED,

22:20.407 --> 22:21.774
JUST LIKE ROLLINS DID.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.546
- WELL, THIS WAS FRUITFUL.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.783
- ASSAULT III
FOR THE BLOODY LIP.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.051
NO TIME, NO REGISTRY.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.720
- THAT WON'T WORK FOR ME,
COUNSELOR.

22:33.753 --> 22:34.921
- ME NEITHER.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.456
NOS VEREMOS
EN LOS TRIBUNALES,

22:36.489 --> 22:38.024
MI AMIGO.

22:43.963 --> 22:46.132
AS THE JURY HAS HEARD,
DETECTIVE TAYMOR'S RAPE KIT

22:46.165 --> 22:49.469
SHOWED A BITE MARK AND BRUISING
ON HER WRISTS AND THIGHS.

22:49.502 --> 22:50.870
IN YOUR EXPERIENCE,

22:50.903 --> 22:53.573
ARE THESE INJURIES CONSISTENT
WITH FORCIBLE RAPE?

22:53.606 --> 22:54.574
- YES.

22:54.607 --> 22:55.642
THEY'RE ALSO CONSISTENT

22:55.675 --> 22:57.043
WITH THE DETAILS
OF HER OUTCRY.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.811
- IS IT TRUE
THAT DETECTIVE TAYMOR

22:58.845 --> 22:59.946
WAS INITIALLY RELUCTANT

22:59.979 --> 23:01.481
TO COOPERATE
WITH THE INVESTIGATION?

23:01.514 --> 23:03.516
- THAT'S NOT UNCOMMON
FOR RAPE VICTIMS,

23:03.550 --> 23:06.419
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE RAPIST
IS KNOWN TO THEM.

23:06.453 --> 23:09.922
THEY FEAR PROFESSIONAL
OR PERSONAL REPERCUSSIONS.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.758
- NOTHING FURTHER.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.526
- NOTHING FOR THIS WITNESS,
YOUR HONOR.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.728
- YOU MAY STEP DOWN,
SERGEANT BENSON.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.038
- AMANDA, YOU CAME?

23:26.072 --> 23:27.974
- HOW'S IT LOOKING?

23:28.007 --> 23:29.075
- PATTON'S SMUG.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.176
I HATE THIS GUY.

23:30.209 --> 23:31.177
- HE'S WORKING THE JURY

23:31.210 --> 23:33.580
WITH LONG LOOKS TO HIS WIFE.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.648
- VIVIENNE?
SHE'S HERE?

23:35.682 --> 23:39.118
- AMANDA ROLLINS.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.888
- GIVE ME A MINUTE.

23:41.921 --> 23:42.922
VIVIENNE.

23:42.955 --> 23:43.923
- LOOK AT YOU.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.124
IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.794
- FIVE YEARS.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.796
- HOW IS YOUR MOTHER, DARLING?

23:49.829 --> 23:52.465
WHAT, WITH YOUR SISTER'S
SITUATION, YOU UP HERE,

23:52.499 --> 23:54.567
IT MUST BE HARD ON HER
ALL BY HER LONESOME.

23:54.601 --> 23:55.902
- OH, HOW SWEET OF YOU TO ASK,

23:55.935 --> 23:57.704
WITH ALL THE DRAMA
YOU'VE GOT GOING ON.

23:57.737 --> 23:58.838
- ME?

23:58.871 --> 24:00.507
NO, I'M BLESSED.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.875
EVERYONE AT HOME KNOWS
WHAT A GOOD MAN CHARLIE IS.

24:02.909 --> 24:05.645
HE HAS A WORLD OF SUPPORT.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.079
OH, THERE'S MY MAN NOW.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.581
EXCUSE ME, DARLING.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.825
- I'VE BEEN AN OFFICER
WITH APD FOR 3 1/2 YEARS.

24:18.858 --> 24:21.160
SINCE CHIEF PATTON PROMOTED ME
TO DETECTIVE LAST YEAR,

24:21.193 --> 24:23.596
HE'S BEEN HEAD OF MY DIVISION.

24:23.630 --> 24:25.197
- COULD YOU DESCRIBE
YOUR RELATIONSHIP?

24:25.231 --> 24:26.799
- I VIEWED HIM AS A MENTOR.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.935
- AND YOU SOCIALIZED
OCCASIONALLY?

24:28.968 --> 24:31.871
- PROFESSIONAL FUNCTIONS,
HOLIDAY PARTIES,

24:31.904 --> 24:33.706
ALWAYS WITH OTHER DETECTIVES.

24:33.740 --> 24:36.042
- WERE YOU WITH OTHER DETECTIVES
ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION?

24:36.075 --> 24:38.845
- YES, UNTIL WE GOT OFF THE
ELEVATOR ON OUR HOTEL FLOOR.

24:38.878 --> 24:40.613
WE HAD ADJOINING ROOMS.

24:40.647 --> 24:43.750
CHIEF PATTON SAID IT WOULD BE
EASIER THAT WAY, FOR WORK.

24:43.783 --> 24:44.751
- OKAY.

24:44.784 --> 24:47.554
AND WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

24:47.587 --> 24:49.722
- WE REACHED OUR DOORS.
WE SAID GOOD NIGHT.

24:49.756 --> 24:52.959
HE TOLD ME HIS CELL PHONE
HAD DE-MAGNETIZED HIS KEY CARD,

24:52.992 --> 24:54.761
AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO
DOWN TO THE FRONT DESK,

24:54.794 --> 24:56.829
AND HE ASKED IF HE COULD ENTER
THROUGH MY ROOM.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.230
- AND ONCE YOU GOT INSIDE?

24:58.264 --> 24:59.899
- HE SUGGESTED ROOM SERVICE.

24:59.932 --> 25:02.001
I SAID FOOD SOUNDED GOOD,

25:02.034 --> 25:04.737
BUT HE ORDERED CHAMPAGNE.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.606
- WERE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

25:06.639 --> 25:08.775
- I DIDN'T WANT TO BE RUDE.

25:08.808 --> 25:11.110
I HAD ONE GLASS.

25:11.143 --> 25:12.579
HE KISSED ME.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.180
I PULLED AWAY.

25:14.213 --> 25:15.447
I SAID HE WAS A MARRIED MAN,

25:15.481 --> 25:19.051
AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST
IF WE JUST CALLED IT A NIGHT.

25:19.085 --> 25:22.088
BUT HE SAID--
HIS EXACT WORDS WERE,

25:22.121 --> 25:23.856
"DON'T YOU KNOW BY NOW

25:23.890 --> 25:25.725
THAT I DON'T TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER?"

25:25.758 --> 25:27.326
HE SHOVED ME DOWN ON THE BED,

25:27.359 --> 25:28.761
PINNED MY WRISTS ABOVE MY HEAD,

25:28.795 --> 25:30.329
AND HE BIT MY LIP TOO.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.664
- DID YOU SAY NO?

25:31.698 --> 25:33.132
- OF COURSE.

25:33.165 --> 25:35.602
"NO, DON'T DO THIS."

25:35.635 --> 25:37.670
THEN HE SLAPPED ME, HARD.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.138
I WAS STUNNED.

25:39.171 --> 25:42.274
HE UNZIPPED, SHOVED HIS KNEE
BETWEEN MY LEGS,

25:42.308 --> 25:44.611
AND FORCED HIMSELF INSIDE ME.

25:47.614 --> 25:48.648
- AND THEN?

25:48.681 --> 25:49.816
- THEN HE FINISHED,

25:49.849 --> 25:52.018
AND HE WENT INTO HIS ROOM.

25:52.051 --> 25:55.187
TOLD ME TO CLEAN MYSELF UP
FOR THE CONFERENCE TOMORROW.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.724
- DETECTIVE TAYMOR,
DID YOU CALL 911

25:57.757 --> 26:00.192
OR HOTEL SECURITY?

26:00.226 --> 26:01.761
- NO.

26:01.794 --> 26:06.232
I WAS--I WAS EMBARRASSED
AND ASHAMED.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.768
I FINISHED THE CHAMPAGNE.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.269
I PASSED OUT.

26:10.302 --> 26:12.905
A FEW HOURS LATER,
I FELL IN THE BATHROOM.

26:12.939 --> 26:13.773
WHEN I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL,

26:13.806 --> 26:15.608
I TOLD THE NURSE
THAT I HAD BEEN RAPED,

26:15.642 --> 26:17.710
AND I TOLD SERGEANT BENSON
FROM SVU.

26:17.744 --> 26:20.279
- YOU ALSO TOLD HER, AT FIRST,

26:20.312 --> 26:22.782
THAT YOU DID NOT
WANT TO COOPERATE.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.250
WHY WAS THAT?

26:24.283 --> 26:27.720
- I WAS AFRAID THAT MY CAREER
WOULD BE OVER,

26:27.754 --> 26:30.122
THAT NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE ME.

26:30.156 --> 26:32.291
- BUT YOU'RE HERE NOW.
- YES.

26:32.324 --> 26:35.828
WHAT CHIEF PATTON DID TO ME
WAS A CRIME,

26:35.862 --> 26:38.297
AND I REALIZED
THAT IF I DIDN'T TESTIFY,

26:38.330 --> 26:39.699
IT MIGHT HAPPEN TO SOMEONE ELSE,

26:39.732 --> 26:43.102
AND I COULDN'T HAVE THAT
ON MY CONSCIENCE.

26:43.135 --> 26:45.137
- THANK YOU, DETECTIVE.

26:47.439 --> 26:51.010
- YOU CLAIM THAT
YOU AND CHIEF PATTON

26:51.043 --> 26:53.012
HAVE NEVER BEEN
ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED?

26:53.045 --> 26:53.880
- WE HAVEN'T.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.414
- DESPITE BEING
CLOSELY MENTORED BY HIM,

26:55.447 --> 26:57.884
YOU'D NEVER CROSSED THE LINE?

26:57.917 --> 27:00.352
- I WASN'T HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH HIM.

27:00.386 --> 27:01.754
I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

27:01.788 --> 27:04.156
- THEN YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH CHIEF PATTON

27:04.190 --> 27:06.659
HAS BEEN STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL,

27:06.693 --> 27:08.995
UNTIL YOU TRAVEL TO NEW YORK,

27:09.028 --> 27:11.397
WHEN HE ATTACKS YOU
IN A HOTEL

27:11.430 --> 27:14.734
FILLED WITH HUNDREDS
OF VISITING POLICE OFFICERS.

27:14.767 --> 27:15.868
- THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

27:15.902 --> 27:17.970
- YOU FLEW HERE TOGETHER,

27:18.004 --> 27:19.672
SPENT THE DAY AT THE CONFERENCE,

27:19.706 --> 27:21.040
AND THEN HAD DINNER TOGETHER
THAT NIGHT

27:21.073 --> 27:21.941
WITH ALL THE DRINKS.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.310
- IT WAS A SOCIAL
BUSINESS GATHERING.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.846
- LATER, WHEN THE TWO OF YOU

27:26.879 --> 27:29.381
GOT OFF THE ELEVATOR
AT THE HOTEL,

27:29.415 --> 27:31.951
ALL VERY FRIENDLY,

27:31.984 --> 27:34.821
ON THE VIDEO YOU WERE SMILING

27:34.854 --> 27:37.790
AS YOU USHERED HIM INTO
YOUR HOTEL ROOM AT 1:00 A.M.

27:37.824 --> 27:40.059
HE ORDERED CHAMPAGNE,
WHICH YOU DRANK.

27:40.092 --> 27:42.094
- I WAS TRYING TO BE POLITE.

27:42.128 --> 27:44.130
- APPARENTLY.

27:46.065 --> 27:50.036
DURING THIS SUPPOSED ASSAULT,

27:50.069 --> 27:54.006
DID YOU SCREAM OR CRY FOR HELP?

27:54.040 --> 27:55.842
- I ASKED HIM TO STOP.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.710
- BUT NOT LOUD ENOUGH
FOR ANYBODY,

27:57.744 --> 28:00.479
ANY OF YOUR FELLOW OFFICERS
TO HEAR.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.215
YOU WERE TRAINED
IN SELF-DEFENSE.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.951
DID YOU FIGHT BACK?

28:04.984 --> 28:06.786
- I STRUGGLED.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.454
- IS THAT SO?

28:08.487 --> 28:10.757
YOU DIDN'T LEAVE ANY MARKS
ON CHIEF PATTON.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.425
NO SCRATCHES, NO BITES.

28:13.459 --> 28:16.162
NONE OF HIS DNA
WAS UNDER YOUR FINGERNAILS.

28:16.195 --> 28:20.499
- I KIND OF...

28:20.532 --> 28:21.734
FROZE.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.770
- YOU FROZE.

28:24.871 --> 28:25.872
HE LEAVES.

28:25.905 --> 28:28.140
NOW YOU'RE ALONE.

28:28.174 --> 28:29.441
WHO'D YOU CALL?

28:29.475 --> 28:30.309
HOTEL SECURITY?

28:30.342 --> 28:32.478
DID YOU CALL ONE
OF THE SVU DETECTIVES

28:32.511 --> 28:34.380
THAT YOU HAD SPENT THE DAY WITH?

28:34.413 --> 28:35.782
- NO.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.884
LIKE I SAID, I WAS HUMILIATED.

28:37.917 --> 28:41.020
- YOU ALSO SAID THAT YOU HAD
FINISHED ALL THE CHAMPAGNE,

28:41.053 --> 28:43.823
ON TOP OF ALL THE DRINKS
THAT YOU HAD AT DINNER.

28:43.856 --> 28:48.494
IN FACT, YOU WERE SO DRUNK,
YOU TOOK A NASTY FALL.

28:48.527 --> 28:51.998
YOU WERE FOUND PASSED OUT
ON YOUR BATHROOM FLOOR.

28:53.299 --> 28:54.133
- YES.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.802
- THEY HAD TO CALL AN AMBULANCE
FOR YOU.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.437
FOR AN AMBITIOUS DETECTIVE
LIKE YOURSELF,

28:58.470 --> 29:00.006
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
VERY EMBARRASSING.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.140
- OBJECTION.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.409
DEFENSE HAS CROSSED OVER
FROM BADGERING TO HARASSMENT.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.011
- AGREED.
MR. BUCHANAN.

29:05.044 --> 29:08.214
- YOU ARE
A SEX CRIMES DETECTIVE.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.917
WHAT WOULD YOU MAKE
OF A VICTIM

29:10.950 --> 29:13.019
WHO LET HER BOSS INTO HER ROOM,

29:13.052 --> 29:15.054
DIDN'T REPORT HER RAPE
UNTIL THE NEXT DAY,

29:15.087 --> 29:16.122
AND THEN RECANTED?

29:16.155 --> 29:19.826
- I WOULD TRY TO UNDERSTAND
THE PRESSURE ON HER.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.360
- WOULD YOU ALSO CONSIDER
THE POSSIBILITY

29:21.393 --> 29:23.796
THAT THERE WAS MORE TO THE STORY
THAN SHE WAS TELLING YOU?

29:23.830 --> 29:25.397
OR LESS?

29:25.431 --> 29:26.999
- I WOULD INVESTIGATE.

29:27.033 --> 29:28.067
BUT IN MY CASE--

29:28.100 --> 29:30.169
- I'LL MARK THAT DOWN AS A YES,

29:30.202 --> 29:33.539
WHICH MAY BE EXACTLY WHAT
CHIEF PATTON DID THAT NIGHT.

29:33.572 --> 29:35.041
- OBJECTION.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.943
- WITHDRAWN.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.277
NOTHING FURTHER.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.521
- REESE.

29:51.858 --> 29:53.559
ARE YOU OKAY?

29:53.592 --> 29:55.027
I KNOW THIS WASN'T EASY.

29:55.061 --> 29:57.129
- YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW?

29:57.163 --> 30:00.166
YOU CONVINCED ME TO TESTIFY,

30:21.187 --> 30:21.387
.

30:21.420 --> 30:22.188
- MY SISTER WAS FACING
FELONY CHARGES,

30:23.222 --> 30:28.094
AND DEPUTY CHIEF PATTON
CALLED ME INTO HIS OFFICE,

30:28.127 --> 30:30.362
SAID WE COULD FIX THE PROBLEM.

30:30.396 --> 30:32.464
- WHAT DID YOU INFER
HE MEANT BY THAT?

30:32.498 --> 30:34.466
- THAT IF I HAD SEX WITH HIM,

30:34.500 --> 30:37.203
MY SISTER WOULD NOT
BE PROSECUTED.

30:39.538 --> 30:42.474
I MEAN, IS THIS NECESSARY?

30:42.508 --> 30:45.277
IT'S NOT LIKE
I'VE NEVER TESTIFIED BEFORE.

30:45.311 --> 30:46.412
- I KNOW YOU'VE
TESTIFIED BEFORE,

30:46.445 --> 30:48.380
NOT ABOUT YOUR OWN ASSAULT.

30:48.414 --> 30:50.482
IF THE JUDGE ALLOWS THIS,
WE NEED TO BE READY.

30:52.518 --> 30:53.485
OKAY?

30:53.519 --> 30:55.054
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.622
DETECTIVE ROLLINS,

30:56.655 --> 31:00.592
DID YOU CONSENT TO SEX
WITH DEPUTY CHIEF PATTON?

31:03.529 --> 31:06.098
- AT FIRST, YES.

31:06.132 --> 31:09.535
WE MET AT A MOTEL, AND...

31:09.568 --> 31:12.504
I LAY DOWN ON THE BED.

31:12.538 --> 31:15.975
AND HE WAS...DRUNK.

31:16.008 --> 31:19.245
GRABBING AT ME
AND PULLING OFF MY CLOTHES.

31:19.278 --> 31:21.447
AND I ASKED HIM TO SLOW DOWN.

31:23.482 --> 31:26.218
AND HE GOT ROUGH WITH ME.

31:26.252 --> 31:29.088
HE BIT ME,

31:29.121 --> 31:30.189
SLAPPED ME,

31:30.222 --> 31:33.392
BANGED MY HEAD
AGAINST THE HEADBOARD.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.527
I WAS BLEEDING.

31:37.529 --> 31:40.566
AND...

31:40.599 --> 31:43.169
I TRIED TO GET UP.

31:43.202 --> 31:46.672
BUT HE SAID...

31:46.705 --> 31:52.011
"AMANDA, YOU KNOW I DON'T
TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER."

31:53.579 --> 31:56.015
- THEN WHAT HAPPENED,
DETECTIVE ROLLINS?

31:58.684 --> 32:01.553
- DEPUTY CHIEF PATTON

32:01.587 --> 32:04.223
PINNED MY WRISTS
ABOVE MY HEAD...

32:08.995 --> 32:10.662
AND HE TOLD ME
I WASN'T GOING ANYWHERE

32:10.696 --> 32:14.700
AND THAT NO ONE
WOULD BELIEVE ME ANYWAY.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.473
I GAVE UP.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.281
HE RAPED ME.

32:42.161 --> 32:43.662
- YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

32:43.695 --> 32:46.398
THAT LITTLE BITCH,
FIVE YEARS AFTER THE FACT.

32:46.432 --> 32:47.633
- TAKE IT EASY, CHIEF.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.468
- COUNSELORS, APPROACH.

32:49.501 --> 32:52.338
- AGAIN, WE OBJECT
TO THIS WITNESS.

32:52.371 --> 32:53.772
SHE WASN'T ON
THE PROSECUTION'S LIST.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.674
SHE'S BEEN SITTING IN
ON TESTIMONY.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.476
THERE HASN'T EVEN BEEN
A MOLINEUX HEARING.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.078
- PRIOR BAD ACTS ARE ADMISSIBLE

32:59.111 --> 33:00.646
WHEN THEY SPEAK CLEARLY
TO PATTERN.

33:00.679 --> 33:02.214
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

33:02.248 --> 33:05.084
SHE'LL BE TESTIFYING
TO AN UNSUBSTANTIATED ALLEGATION

33:05.117 --> 33:06.452
WHICH WAS NEVER REPORTED.

33:06.485 --> 33:07.453
NO CHARGES WERE EVER FILED--

33:07.486 --> 33:09.621
- I HEAR YOU, COUNSELORS,
NOW STOP TALKING.

33:12.091 --> 33:14.560
HAVING READ THE SUMMARY TEXT
OF THIS WITNESS'S TESTIMONY,

33:14.593 --> 33:19.098
IT IS MY RULING THAT IT WOULD BE
MORE PREJUDICIAL THAN PROBATIVE.

33:19.131 --> 33:20.566
I WILL NOT ALLOW
THIS WITNESS TO TESTIFY.

33:20.599 --> 33:21.533
- THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

33:21.567 --> 33:24.603
- MR. BARBA, ANY OTHER
LAST-MINUTE SALVOS?

33:24.636 --> 33:26.372
- PROSECUTION RESTS.

33:26.405 --> 33:28.074
- THEN WE'LL RECONVENE
AFTER LUNCH

33:28.107 --> 33:30.076
WITH YOUR FIRST WITNESS,
MR. BUCHANAN.

33:33.212 --> 33:35.347
- AFTER ALL THAT,
SHE WON'T LET ME TESTIFY.

33:35.381 --> 33:36.515
- IT WAS ALWAYS A LONG SHOT.

33:36.548 --> 33:37.683
- SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

33:37.716 --> 33:39.218
- MY BET,
PATTON TAKES THE STAND.

33:39.251 --> 33:40.219
IT'S A "HE SAID, SHE SAID."

33:40.252 --> 33:42.788
HE'S GOT TO SAY SOMETHING,
AND I'LL GET HIM.

33:48.727 --> 33:53.432
- THE REAL VICTIM IN ALL OF THIS
IS MY WIFE, VIVIENNE.

33:53.465 --> 33:54.500
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER,

33:54.533 --> 33:56.435
AN OLD MAN LIKE MYSELF.

33:56.468 --> 34:00.139
I WAS FLATTERED BY A YOUNG
WOMAN'S APPARENT INTEREST IN ME.

34:00.172 --> 34:03.809
BUT I APOLOGIZE TO MY WIFE
AND TO THE ATLANTA P.D.

34:03.842 --> 34:06.545
FOR THE EMBARRASSMENT
THAT MY FOOLISHNESS

34:06.578 --> 34:09.148
AND THIS FARCE HAS CAUSED.

34:09.181 --> 34:13.219
- SO YOU DID NOT RAPE
DETECTIVE TAYMOR?

34:13.252 --> 34:14.520
- NO, SIR.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.655
AS GOD IS MY WITNESS,

34:16.688 --> 34:19.525
OUR BRIEF AFFAIR WAS CONSENSUAL.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.460
I WOULD NEVER HARM A WOMAN.

34:21.493 --> 34:23.495
- NOTHING FURTHER.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.200
- IT'S YOUR TESTIMONY THAT,

34:28.234 --> 34:30.102
DESPITE BEING HER MENTOR,

34:30.136 --> 34:32.438
YOU AND YOUR SUBORDINATE
DETECTIVE TAYMOR

34:32.471 --> 34:34.473
WERE ALSO HAVING
A CONSENSUAL AFFAIR?

34:36.375 --> 34:37.576
- I'M NOT PROUD OF THAT.

34:37.609 --> 34:41.480
- AND EVERYTHING WAS GOING FINE
UNTIL YOU CAME TO NEW YORK?

34:41.513 --> 34:43.149
FOR NO REASON, SHE CRIED RAPE?

34:43.182 --> 34:45.384
- THERE WAS A REASON.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.453
SHE WAS ANGRY THAT
I WASN'T LEAVING MY WIFE.

34:47.486 --> 34:50.489
- YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD
NEVER HARM A WOMAN.

34:52.558 --> 34:53.692
DOES THAT INCLUDE ANY OTHER

34:53.725 --> 34:55.361
YOUNG, BLONDE SUBORDINATES
YOU'VE MENTORED?

34:55.394 --> 34:56.362
- OBJECTION.

34:56.395 --> 34:57.763
- SUSTAINED.
MR. BARBA.

34:57.796 --> 34:59.465
- ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT AMANDA ROLLINS?

34:59.498 --> 35:01.467
I DIDN'T RAPE HER
OR THAT OTHER GIRL,

35:01.500 --> 35:02.468
OR ANY OF THEM.

35:02.501 --> 35:03.535
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY

35:03.569 --> 35:04.703
WHEN THEY DON'T GET
WHAT THEY WANT.

35:04.736 --> 35:05.704
- YOUR HONOR.

35:05.737 --> 35:06.772
- I'M GOING TO INSTRUCT THE JURY

35:06.805 --> 35:08.140
TO DISREGARD
THAT LAST QUESTION

35:08.174 --> 35:09.241
AND THE DEFENDANT'S ANSWER.

35:09.275 --> 35:10.442
IT'LL BE STRICKEN
FROM THE RECORD.

35:10.476 --> 35:11.843
- LET'S GET BACK
TO THE CONFERENCE.

35:11.877 --> 35:13.379
YOU DIDN'T INVITE YOUR WIFE.

35:13.412 --> 35:14.380
- [chuckles]

35:14.413 --> 35:16.682
NEW YORK IN JANUARY?

35:16.715 --> 35:18.484
WELL, THESE THINGS
ARE ALL BUSINESS ANYWAY,

35:18.517 --> 35:19.818
SO I KNEW I WOULDN'T
HAVE THE TIME

35:19.851 --> 35:21.587
TO GIVE HER THE ATTENTION
THAT SHE DESERVES.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.755
- ALL BUSINESS?

35:23.789 --> 35:25.191
WAS IT BUSINESS AT 1:00 A.M.

35:25.224 --> 35:26.392
WHEN YOU STEPPED
OFF THE ELEVATOR

35:26.425 --> 35:28.494
CLEARLY DRUNK
WITH DETECTIVE TAYMOR?

35:28.527 --> 35:30.529
- WELL, PART OF THE CONVENTION
IS NETWORKING

35:30.562 --> 35:31.897
WITH OTHER MEMBERS
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.

35:31.930 --> 35:33.899
- NETWORKING.

35:33.932 --> 35:37.703
YOUR KEY CARD DIDN'T WORK
WHEN YOU RETURNED TO YOUR FLOOR.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.405
- [clears throat]

35:39.438 --> 35:41.207
UH, YEAH.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.375
YOU KNOW, MY PHONE--

35:43.409 --> 35:45.511
MY PHONE MUST HAVE
DEACTIVATED IT.

35:45.544 --> 35:47.346
- IF YOU WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR,

35:47.379 --> 35:49.681
THEN WHY THE KEY CARD RUSE?

35:49.715 --> 35:52.284
ISN'T THAT THE POINT
OF ADJOINING ROOMS?

35:52.318 --> 35:53.952
YOU ENTER SEPARATELY,
MEET IN THE MIDDLE,

35:53.985 --> 35:55.721
DO WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO?

35:55.754 --> 35:57.656
- WELL, I DIDN'T WANT
TO ASSUME...

35:57.689 --> 35:59.191
- NATURALLY.

35:59.225 --> 36:03.195
LET ME ASK, WHO BOOKED THE ROOMS
FOR THIS TRIP?

36:03.229 --> 36:06.532
- UM...WELL, THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN SOMEONE IN MY OFFICE.

36:06.565 --> 36:07.933
- LET'S SAY THAT YOUR KEY CARD
REALLY DIDN'T WORK

36:07.966 --> 36:11.503
AND YOU HAD TO GO
THROUGH DETECTIVE TAYMOR'S ROOM.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.239
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT YOUR
ADJOINING DOOR WOULD BE OPEN?

36:13.272 --> 36:14.240
- YOU SON OF A BITCH.

36:14.273 --> 36:15.741
- DID YOU LEAVE THAT DOOR
DELIBERATELY OPEN,

36:15.774 --> 36:16.742
OR WAS THAT JUST A--

36:16.775 --> 36:17.609
- OBJECTION.

36:17.643 --> 36:18.944
- CHIEF PATTON,
DO YOU NEED A MINUTE?

36:18.977 --> 36:20.279
- [coughing]

36:20.312 --> 36:21.280
- WOULD YOU LIKE
A GLASS OF WATER,

36:21.313 --> 36:22.881
DEPUTY CHIEF PATTON?

36:22.914 --> 36:24.616
- [hacking]

36:24.650 --> 36:25.984
- MAY I CONSULT WITH MY CLIENT?

36:26.017 --> 36:26.985
- BREATHE.

36:27.018 --> 36:27.986
BAILIFF.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.621
- SOMEONE CALL AN AMBULANCE.

36:29.655 --> 36:30.856
- [hacking]

36:30.889 --> 36:32.691
- HE'S HAVING A HEART ATTACK!

36:44.770 --> 36:44.970
.

36:45.003 --> 36:45.604
- OKAY, THANKS FOR THE UPDATE.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.710
PATTON DIDN'T HAVE
A HEART ATTACK.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.745
THEY SAY IT WAS ANXIETY.

36:53.779 --> 36:55.414
- SO THE TRIAL WILL CONTINUE.

36:55.447 --> 36:58.550
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

36:58.584 --> 37:00.586
WILL YOU CLOSE THE DOOR
FOR A SEC?

37:06.525 --> 37:07.993
AMANDA, WHAT PATTON DID TO YOU,

37:08.026 --> 37:10.662
YOU'VE BEEN PUSHING DOWN
FOR YEARS.

37:10.696 --> 37:13.031
AND IF YOU DON'T
DEAL WITH THIS NOW,

37:13.064 --> 37:18.804
IT'S GONNA KEEP YOU TRAPPED OR
STUCK MORE THAN IT ALREADY HAS.

37:18.837 --> 37:21.840
- OKAY.
- YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE.

37:23.342 --> 37:24.476
- I'VE GONE THROUGH IT.

37:26.612 --> 37:30.682
YOU'RE ONLY AS SICK
AS YOUR SECRETS, AND--

37:30.716 --> 37:32.551
AND I'M GOING TO MEETINGS.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.587
- YEAH, FOR GAMBLING.

37:35.621 --> 37:37.523
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE
FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF.

37:37.556 --> 37:38.757
I GET IT.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.759
BUT CAN YOU GO BACK
TO THAT DETECTIVE

37:40.792 --> 37:43.295
THAT YOU WERE FIVE YEARS AGO

37:43.329 --> 37:45.397
AND FEEL COMPASSION FOR HER?

37:47.699 --> 37:49.668
- I WALKED INTO IT.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.803
YOU KNOW, I PUT MYSELF
INTO THAT POSITION.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.673
- YOU'VE GOT TO STOP
BLAMING YOURSELF.

37:54.706 --> 37:58.777
AMANDA, YOU CAN MOVE PAST THIS.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.812
- I'M OKAY.

38:03.048 --> 38:05.083
- LOOK, I KNOW THAT YOU THINK
THAT THERAPY

38:05.116 --> 38:06.985
IS PAYING SOMEONE
TO TALK ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS.

38:07.018 --> 38:08.954
- I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT
TO YOU.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.989
- THEN MAKE IT UP TO ME.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.394
I WANT YOU TO SEE MY THERAPIST.

38:18.096 --> 38:19.097
- I'M NOT SEEING YOUR THERAPIST.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.499
- IT'S JUST FOR A REFERRAL.

38:20.532 --> 38:22.634
I KNOW HE HAS TIME LATER TODAY.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.803
I'M GONNA TELL HIM
THAT YOU'RE GONNA CALL.

38:24.836 --> 38:27.506
IT'S IMPORTANT, AMANDA.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.776
- OKAY, SERGEANT.

38:50.028 --> 38:52.330
[exhales]

39:04.743 --> 39:08.113
- HEY, SUGAR,
HOW ABOUT A SMILE, HUH?

39:08.146 --> 39:11.349
- HEY, GIRL,
IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.427
- DEPUTY CHIEF PATTON'S HEALTH

39:21.460 --> 39:23.895
PRECLUDES HIM
FROM CONTINUING THIS TRIAL.

39:23.929 --> 39:25.931
- HE HAD AN ANXIETY ATTACK.

39:25.964 --> 39:28.700
- IN THE INTEREST OF GETTING HIM
HOME FOR FURTHER TESTS,

39:28.734 --> 39:32.504
WE'LL PLEAD GUILTY TO SEXUAL
ABUSE IN THE THIRD DEGREE.

39:32.538 --> 39:34.940
HE'LL GO ON THE REGISTRY.

39:34.973 --> 39:38.444
PROBATION, COMMUNITY SERVICE,
NO JAIL TIME.

39:38.477 --> 39:39.811
- FINE.

39:39.845 --> 39:41.513
- HE'LL RESIGN HIS POSITION
AS DEPUTY CHIEF FIRST.

39:41.547 --> 39:42.648
- PROTECTING HIS PENSION?

39:42.681 --> 39:44.049
- FOR HIS WIFE
AND FAMILY'S SAKE.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.517
- AND HE WILL NOT SEEK
ANY FURTHER EMPLOYMENT

39:45.551 --> 39:47.553
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

39:48.554 --> 39:50.121
- [sighs]

39:50.155 --> 39:53.725
- I WILL NEED YOU TO ALLOCUTE
TO THE SEXUAL ASSAULT

39:53.759 --> 39:55.461
IN OPEN COURT.

39:59.998 --> 40:01.399
- FINE.

40:06.204 --> 40:07.673
- DEPUTY CHIEF PATTON,

40:07.706 --> 40:09.608
YOUR LAWYER TELLS ME
