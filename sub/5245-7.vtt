00:20.939 --> 00:23.692
<i>This is one of the largest
and most mysterious plane crashes</i>

00:23.900 --> 00:25.235
<i>in Colombian history.</i>

01:05.650 --> 01:07.736
You know where Jaime is?

01:07.819 --> 01:10.739
No, sir.
I don't know where he is.

01:11.990 --> 01:13.616
He left home and hasn't returned.

01:13.825 --> 01:17.036
- Have Pablo and his men come by here?
- No.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.414
- Your name is Natalie?
- Yes, sir.

01:19.497 --> 01:23.501
Natalie, your boyfriend, Jaime,
was he with Pablo's sicarios?

01:24.627 --> 01:26.254
- No.
- Are you sure?

01:27.005 --> 01:28.089
Yes, sir.

01:28.173 --> 01:31.551
Well, then, why do you
have this picture of Pablo in your house?

01:32.635 --> 01:36.431
Nothing wrong with that.
Everyone in the comuna has one.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.726
You think those thugs
are going to protect you?

01:39.934 --> 01:44.355
You don't understand...
that you represent a big problem for them.

01:44.564 --> 01:47.066
We can help you.

01:47.275 --> 01:51.404
We can protect you.
But you have to tell us the truth.

02:16.095 --> 02:19.599
I don't want to leave, my love.
I don't want to leave.

02:19.808 --> 02:22.519
But I must, for all our safety.

02:22.602 --> 02:24.479
Did you do something wrong?

02:25.730 --> 02:30.401
Your dad did nothing wrong.

02:33.238 --> 02:39.285
These are people who are jealous of us,
who are trying to take what we have.

02:40.119 --> 02:41.871
You have to be strong.

02:43.540 --> 02:46.125
I want you to be strong.

02:46.209 --> 02:49.796
You have to be strong
and never show weakness.

02:49.879 --> 02:51.756
I promise I'll never be weak.

02:53.925 --> 02:56.344
And watch out for your sister.

03:03.726 --> 03:05.061
I love you very much.

03:07.856 --> 03:09.440
I love you all very much.

03:12.485 --> 03:16.197
- Do not spoil this boy.
- But... what do you mean?

03:16.281 --> 03:21.411
- Watch her.
- Just a few sweets and some pork rinds.

03:29.627 --> 03:32.338
Be careful, son. Be careful.

03:44.976 --> 03:47.520
- I love you.
- Me, too.

03:49.022 --> 03:50.607
Take care.

03:52.817 --> 03:54.193
And what about you?

03:54.402 --> 03:57.322
Come on.
I'm going to take you with me.

03:57.405 --> 04:00.783
I'm going to take you with me...

04:15.715 --> 04:17.467
Take care.

04:23.556 --> 04:25.433
You think he did it?

04:26.517 --> 04:28.144
Surely not.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.565
Blow up that plane?

04:34.901 --> 04:37.570
Of course he did it, Hermilda.

04:37.654 --> 04:39.614
But he had his reasons.

04:43.242 --> 04:47.747
We've got everyone looking
for Jaime's wife throughout the comunas.

04:49.332 --> 04:52.085
I want you to find her and kill her.

04:53.086 --> 04:56.798
And kill any motherfucker that
can connect me with that fucking plane.

04:57.882 --> 04:59.425
Yes, sir.

06:38.399 --> 06:41.527
<i>...the functions of President of Colombia?</i>

06:41.611 --> 06:43.029
<i>I swear.</i>

07:01.714 --> 07:04.050
Well, César, congratulations.

07:04.133 --> 07:06.511
Not César... I mean, Mr. President.

07:08.888 --> 07:10.264
Excuse us.

07:13.935 --> 07:18.981
As a former president to a new one...
what advice would you give?

07:19.065 --> 07:24.737
Well... you'll be asked
to make many difficult decisions.

07:24.821 --> 07:28.032
I would say one thing...
do what your wife says.

07:28.116 --> 07:29.867
I always do.

07:33.162 --> 07:39.127
Trust your instincts,
and be confident in your decisions.

07:40.128 --> 07:41.504
Yes...

07:42.547 --> 07:45.341
but that's easier said than done.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.677
You'll never be able to please everyone,

07:47.760 --> 07:50.263
so find the solution
that rings true in your heart.

07:50.346 --> 07:51.514
Thank you.

07:51.597 --> 07:54.267
Another thing I did want to tell you,
about the Americans--

07:54.350 --> 07:56.310
What about the Americans?

07:57.395 --> 08:01.274
This will have to be off the record,
my dear.

08:01.357 --> 08:05.236
I can't have my opinions
broadcast on your television show.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.321
No, no, no.
You have my word.

08:08.406 --> 08:10.867
- The Americans...
- Yes?

08:11.868 --> 08:13.536
Be careful.

10:16.242 --> 10:18.786
- Pablo.
- What's up, Pacho?

10:23.457 --> 10:25.167
Thank you.

11:16.344 --> 11:21.682
We have Miami...
and have left you alone in New York.

11:21.766 --> 11:25.269
- Yes, for a price.
- Certainly.

11:25.353 --> 11:30.775
Look, Pacho, we agreed that we would
share the Los Angeles territory...

11:31.692 --> 11:33.444
and that hasn't been happening.

11:33.652 --> 11:37.239
It seems you are not
holding up our agreement.

11:37.448 --> 11:40.951
- How's that?
- Exactly what I'm saying, Pacho.

11:46.499 --> 11:48.000
Look, Pablo...

11:49.085 --> 11:53.089
you know that our partners
sometimes operate independently.

11:53.172 --> 11:56.342
If Mr. Galeano
and Mr. Moncada are correct,

11:56.425 --> 11:59.512
then you have my assurance
that it will be rectified.

11:59.637 --> 12:01.013
Thanks a lot, Pacho.

12:01.222 --> 12:05.226
Disputes between us
cause needless bloodshed.

12:05.309 --> 12:11.023
Then fix it. A war between our groups
is the last thing we need right now.

12:12.983 --> 12:15.236
It would seem you already have a war.

12:16.278 --> 12:18.864
Maybe bombing that plane
was a step too far.

12:20.950 --> 12:22.493
Careful, Pacho.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.370
Careful.
The only difference between us

12:24.453 --> 12:26.956
is our little misunderstanding
with the government.

12:27.039 --> 12:28.833
And that will be resolved soon.

12:29.041 --> 12:31.001
Besides, that's the business,
for all of us.

12:31.085 --> 12:32.962
Yes, it's true for all of us.

12:33.170 --> 12:36.257
The only war we are really fighting
is the war against extradition.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.801
And the outcome of that
is something we're all interested in.

12:38.884 --> 12:42.221
It's true, Gustavo.
Gustavo is right.

12:42.304 --> 12:45.724
We have a common goal,
and that is to get rid of extradition.

12:46.434 --> 12:50.312
The United States is big enough
for all of us to operate in.

12:50.396 --> 12:55.401
Let's figure out Los Angeles
once you take care of your business here.

13:00.114 --> 13:01.407
You know what bothers me?

13:03.701 --> 13:05.286
Your arrogance.

13:06.245 --> 13:08.581
Your attitude, your air of superiority.

13:10.374 --> 13:16.338
Careful, Pacho... that you don't
get yourself killed for that.

13:25.931 --> 13:27.808
Thank you for coming.

13:44.158 --> 13:47.411
- I'm gonna kill that homo bastard.
- Come on, Pablo, let me kill him.

13:47.495 --> 13:48.746
Stop talking shit, Moncada.

13:48.954 --> 13:52.875
We'll kill that fag later.
Right now, we can't be out in the open.

13:52.958 --> 13:56.670
If that son of a bitch
starts selling shit in Los Angeles,

13:56.754 --> 14:02.885
I'm personally gonna put a gun up his ass
and pull the trigger. I swear.

14:03.093 --> 14:05.513
That will make him fall in love with you.

15:59.752 --> 16:01.795
I think it's up this way.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.174
I don't want to shoot her.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.761
Kill that cute girl?
And the baby, too?

16:08.844 --> 16:12.556
I don't know why the boss
wants us to kill that girl.

16:14.475 --> 16:18.228
- What does she know about Avianca anyway?
- Just shut up and follow orders!

16:21.315 --> 16:23.150
Does he think putting a bomb
on every street corner

16:23.233 --> 16:24.902
is going to get the police
to quit chasing him?

16:25.110 --> 16:27.905
Gustavo, we need to get away,
out of this country.

16:32.117 --> 16:34.119
And go where?

16:34.203 --> 16:37.373
We'll be treated like criminals
wherever we go.

16:40.167 --> 16:43.629
They'll kill him, and you know it.

16:43.712 --> 16:46.006
I just hope he doesn't
take you down with him.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.968
This isn't our war.

16:52.054 --> 16:55.432
This isn't war.
It's negotiation.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.649
Don't you understand
what an opportunity this is?

17:03.732 --> 17:06.860
He's willing to consider
terms of surrender--

17:06.944 --> 17:11.573
Under what conditions?
My God, he just blew up a plane!

17:11.657 --> 17:14.660
Eduardo, calm down.
Let the man speak.

17:14.743 --> 17:19.707
We can end this violence with dignity.
It's good for both sides--

17:19.790 --> 17:22.918
Do you realize
how stupid you sound right now?

17:23.001 --> 17:24.211
César, this is absurd.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.130
- Eduardo, please--
- This is a farce.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.548
Please.

17:28.590 --> 17:32.261
Let me deal with this. Please.

17:32.344 --> 17:34.596
Fine. Whatever you want.

17:39.476 --> 17:42.062
We can at least begin a discussion, right?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.107
Even though you never stated it,

17:45.190 --> 17:49.361
surely you'd like
to see the bombings stop.

17:50.696 --> 17:53.741
- Yes. Yes, I would.
- Exactly.

17:53.824 --> 17:57.161
So if we begin a dialogue,
they will cease.

17:57.244 --> 18:02.291
That affords us all some time,
including the Search Bloc.

18:03.667 --> 18:04.752
Fernando...

18:06.211 --> 18:10.424
you saw his money,
and it blinded you to his soul.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.676
That son of a bitch has no soul.

18:17.473 --> 18:23.312
If telling him we're negotiating allows
the bombs to stop while we find him...

18:24.938 --> 18:26.273
then be my guest.

18:31.320 --> 18:35.240
Thank you.
Really, thank you.

19:24.498 --> 19:26.708
Look, man,
Pablo's turned into a saint.

19:26.792 --> 19:30.712
Of course.
He sends people straight to heaven.

19:57.155 --> 20:00.659
She's not here.
She might have just left.

20:01.618 --> 20:03.704
Let's search the comuna.

20:04.872 --> 20:07.416
Look, Poison, I'm telling you
Pablo is being paranoid.

20:07.499 --> 20:09.543
Careful what you say, son.

20:10.627 --> 20:13.213
One day,
he is going to ask me to kill you.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.175
Would you do it?

20:17.259 --> 20:19.970
If he asks me... of course.

20:20.721 --> 20:22.514
There is no way around it.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.893
Wouldn't you?

20:32.858 --> 20:35.360
All right, all right,
let's just go find this girl.

20:35.444 --> 20:37.696
We'll look around
and see where she's hiding.

20:40.198 --> 20:41.658
What's wrong?

20:41.742 --> 20:43.160
Here you go.

20:43.368 --> 20:45.704
It's OK, Natalie. Don't worry.

20:45.787 --> 20:50.626
Before you know it, we'll get you
some food. Right? Isn't that right?

20:50.709 --> 20:51.877
Thank you.

21:06.016 --> 21:08.060
What then, Fernando?

21:08.143 --> 21:10.979
Has the Colombian government
offered a truce?

21:12.773 --> 21:15.525
The government
hasn't been willing to offer anything

21:15.609 --> 21:17.277
I would consider acceptable.

21:17.486 --> 21:19.071
What did they offer?

21:19.988 --> 21:21.990
They want you to admit...

21:24.743 --> 21:26.328
that you're responsible for Avianca.

21:26.411 --> 21:29.539
And of course, I told them that--
That we can't even--

21:29.748 --> 21:31.375
Is it that you're not negotiating a thing?

21:31.458 --> 21:33.669
No, no, of course I'm negotiating--

21:33.752 --> 21:37.881
Then why is Carrillo
stopping every car in the comunas

21:37.965 --> 21:40.634
and killing my boys
with the help of the gringos?!

21:41.969 --> 21:46.640
Why are the Americans helping them if we
are supposed to be negotiating, Fernando?

21:48.725 --> 21:53.730
Gaviria doesn't want the gringos to know
he's willing to negotiate with you.

21:56.358 --> 21:57.526
That's it.

22:03.281 --> 22:05.367
Be very careful, Fernando.

22:10.122 --> 22:10.956
Yes, Pablo.

22:14.835 --> 22:15.961
Yes.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.234
You've got to stop the bombing, Pablo.

22:40.861 --> 22:45.782
I don't know what you're thinking anymore.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.454
I think we should...

22:52.247 --> 22:54.332
reorganize a bit...

22:55.542 --> 23:01.965
and start sending our boys out to burn
some houses down and do some damage...

23:02.049 --> 23:04.968
to politicians and senators
all over the country.

23:05.177 --> 23:09.639
And to the soldiers and cops in our way,
the judges who annoy us

23:09.723 --> 23:11.141
and the reporters that watch us,

23:11.224 --> 23:15.270
basically, we have to create a presence so
disruptive they'll want nothing but peace.

23:15.479 --> 23:18.648
That's the only way
we're going to get there.

23:18.732 --> 23:23.528
Is that it? Is that what you want?
A civil war?

23:25.614 --> 23:29.159
- You've gone crazy, asshole.
- We have to fight, brother.

23:29.826 --> 23:32.496
Let's put our hearts into this.

23:34.039 --> 23:36.917
And if we all must die, so be it.

23:39.753 --> 23:41.171
Well, yes...

23:44.549 --> 23:47.177
The thing is,
I don't want to die yet, Pablo.

23:56.686 --> 23:57.979
Nor do I.

24:01.233 --> 24:03.652
But the bombs make the public want peace.

24:03.860 --> 24:06.404
And that will influence the politicians.

24:15.956 --> 24:21.795
You're the one who says the politicians
don't give a shit about the public.

24:22.629 --> 24:27.342
If you want to influence politicians,
you'll have to narrow your focus.

24:28.385 --> 24:29.427
You know what I mean?

24:39.479 --> 24:41.064
What about her?

24:41.148 --> 24:43.400
No, she is way too much of a princess.

24:43.483 --> 24:44.985
Surely we would have problems with her.

24:45.193 --> 24:47.070
My God, look at that face.

24:47.279 --> 24:51.074
The media is going to love that fox,
right?

24:51.158 --> 24:54.119
Sure they will, but so will our boys.

24:54.202 --> 24:55.829
Just think what
they're gonna do to her.

24:56.913 --> 24:57.831
Well...

24:58.957 --> 25:02.043
I say let's start with her...

25:05.797 --> 25:06.756
Move it!

25:09.801 --> 25:10.886
...and this fag.

25:21.271 --> 25:22.230
And this cute couple.

25:35.368 --> 25:39.164
Family members of the most
influential people in the country

25:39.247 --> 25:43.043
have been kidnapped
on the very streets they call home.

25:44.002 --> 25:46.671
What does Pablo Escobar want?

25:46.755 --> 25:50.800
I'll see you tomorrow on the same channel
for a special report.

25:57.182 --> 25:58.892
Is everything all right?

26:01.645 --> 26:03.980
All the victims are my friends.

26:20.664 --> 26:21.957
Excuse me.

26:27.128 --> 26:28.588
The kidnapping of Francisco Santos,

26:28.672 --> 26:31.424
the editor in chief of the most important
newspaper in the nation,

26:31.508 --> 26:34.302
is the latest and most shocking
in a string of kidnappings

26:34.386 --> 26:36.638
orchestrated by the Medellin cartel.

26:36.721 --> 26:39.099
Reporting to you, I'm Valeria Velez.

26:39.307 --> 26:43.937
- All right.
- First on the scene, right? As always.

26:46.356 --> 26:49.234
Maybe if you actually
had to work for a living,

26:49.317 --> 26:51.903
you'd be hungry enough to get here first.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.948
I found out from Santos' wife...

26:55.031 --> 26:57.951
a half hour after
he didn't show up for dinner.

26:58.785 --> 26:59.869
YOU?

27:00.870 --> 27:01.955
Who tipped you off?

27:03.623 --> 27:05.292
It's a pleasure to see you,
as always.

27:26.604 --> 27:30.817
These are Pablo's conditions
for the release of the hostages.

27:30.900 --> 27:33.820
You've read them,
you can see they're very reasonable.

27:33.903 --> 27:35.572
"Very reasonable," he says.

27:36.489 --> 27:39.367
You are definitely an imbecile, Fernando.

27:39.576 --> 27:41.453
And I'm going to tell you something.

27:41.536 --> 27:45.749
You will get what you deserve very soon,
I assure you.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.800
I'm also one of those hostages.

27:56.718 --> 28:03.224
I myself could be walking around calmly...
but like them, I am not free.

28:07.687 --> 28:12.067
Escobar is asking us to surrender,
but that will never happen.

28:14.110 --> 28:16.946
If he releases the hostages
and turns himself in,

28:17.030 --> 28:19.491
we will take this into account.

28:22.410 --> 28:24.371
Gaviria isn't going to bend.

28:27.499 --> 28:29.542
Then I'm going to break him.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.803
You, get up from there.

28:48.770 --> 28:54.150
The body of Ofelia Hernandez was found
dumped next to the Presidential Palace.

28:54.943 --> 28:58.571
<i>One must admire President Gaviria.
I'm sure it can't be easy for him</i>

28:58.655 --> 29:01.658
<i>to stand by his decision
to not negotiate with Escobar.</i>

29:02.784 --> 29:04.035
What's the plan?

29:06.788 --> 29:09.541
A few more hostages and they will give in.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.379
Their time is running out.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.256
I'm talking about us.

29:18.133 --> 29:20.468
What about us, Valeria?

29:25.515 --> 29:28.810
I don't have time
for that pussy shit right now.

29:34.941 --> 29:36.818
Colombia's sweetheart.

29:36.901 --> 29:40.238
You know the only reason
this hag has any fame

29:40.321 --> 29:42.449
is because her father was president.

29:43.533 --> 29:45.910
I despise her.

29:47.454 --> 29:49.539
And why do you care so much?

29:52.083 --> 29:55.003
Your ratings are through the roof, right?

29:55.086 --> 29:57.255
Hers are higher.

30:27.243 --> 30:28.870
Open the door, quick!

30:30.914 --> 30:32.040
Move!

30:32.832 --> 30:34.083
<i>Let's gm!</i>

30:35.418 --> 30:36.544
Hurry UP!

31:19.587 --> 31:20.964
Where am I?

31:23.925 --> 31:25.051
Hello!

31:26.803 --> 31:28.304
Tell me where I am.

31:30.098 --> 31:32.225
Does my family know I'm alive?

31:32.308 --> 31:33.810
How would I know?

31:37.689 --> 31:38.940
Who are you?

31:40.858 --> 31:42.986
You work for Escobar?

31:44.529 --> 31:46.155
You can call me Gorilla.

31:48.866 --> 31:49.701
Gorilla.

31:51.786 --> 31:54.330
Very well... Gorilla.

31:55.665 --> 31:57.125
Where's my crew?

31:59.002 --> 32:00.503
Did you bring them here as well?

32:02.547 --> 32:06.467
I'm here to guard you. That's it.

32:32.118 --> 32:34.287
Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me.

32:34.495 --> 32:38.333
We understand the frustration and pain
you must be feeling for your children,

32:38.416 --> 32:42.211
but believe me,
we are doing everything we can

32:42.295 --> 32:44.505
to make sure your children get home soon.

32:44.589 --> 32:47.383
Our daughter was kidnapped
on her way to an interview.

32:47.467 --> 32:50.762
They killed the bodyguard.
No one is safe.

32:50.845 --> 32:56.059
As a former president, I understand
the terrible position you're in.

32:56.142 --> 32:59.937
But we're here to find a solution.

33:00.146 --> 33:02.940
I understand your frustration,
Dr. Turbay.

33:03.858 --> 33:09.781
But if we give in now, any criminal
can hold our government hostage.

33:09.864 --> 33:14.118
This isn't "any criminal."
This is the worst criminal in the world.

33:14.202 --> 33:16.537
- And he is laughing at all of us.
- Mr. President,

33:16.621 --> 33:22.001
you're proceeding as you must, but we must
act as the parents of our children.

33:22.085 --> 33:24.962
Let's pray you find a solution.

33:53.950 --> 33:55.618
Hands up!

33:56.953 --> 33:59.580
- Why are you driving this car?
- I don't know.

33:59.664 --> 34:02.583
Someone paid me 50,000 pesos
to drive it around the city.

34:12.135 --> 34:13.928
Pablo came to see me.

34:14.011 --> 34:15.096
Why?

34:15.179 --> 34:17.390
He wants to settle the dispute
we have in the United States.

34:17.473 --> 34:19.142
The Los Angeles problems.

34:19.225 --> 34:22.103
He has bigger issues
than that right now.

34:22.186 --> 34:24.647
He'll make a deal with the government.

34:24.731 --> 34:28.901
He's managed to secure
some very effective bargaining chips.

34:28.985 --> 34:31.863
Of course,
he'll look after you guys, right?

34:31.946 --> 34:35.408
We haven't talked to Pablo in weeks.
He's in hiding.

34:36.743 --> 34:39.495
Look at that.
What a beautiful animal, Jorge.

34:39.579 --> 34:40.621
You like it?

34:41.372 --> 34:42.749
Yes, of course.

34:42.832 --> 34:46.627
I'm sure he'll look after you.
After all, you're partners.

34:46.836 --> 34:48.546
Yes, of course. Partners.

34:53.301 --> 34:57.847
You could always have your sister
put in a good word with Gustavo.

34:57.930 --> 34:59.807
What do you mean?

35:00.725 --> 35:03.060
Oh, I'm sorry,
I thought you knew.

35:03.269 --> 35:07.023
It could be gossip.
You know how people like to talk.

35:15.156 --> 35:17.617
You should eat,
because you're going to be here a while.

35:17.700 --> 35:19.577
You're going to get very hungry.

35:20.703 --> 35:22.789
I don't feel well.

35:22.872 --> 35:26.542
What's wrong? Are you sick?

35:26.626 --> 35:28.628
I can get you some medicine.

35:30.171 --> 35:32.715
It's not that kind of illness.

35:33.925 --> 35:40.139
I want to congratulate you.
I know you're a very good reporter.

35:41.557 --> 35:42.767
Thank you.

35:45.228 --> 35:47.730
Gorilla, how long have you been
working for Escobar?

35:47.939 --> 35:51.526
Oh, it's been a while.

35:51.609 --> 35:54.987
So you know what's going on out there,
don't you?

35:55.071 --> 35:59.742
The truth is, I don't go out.
So I have no idea what's happening.

36:01.160 --> 36:04.455
What the fuck are you doing, Gorilla?
Why isn't she wearing the blindfold?

36:04.539 --> 36:05.873
I didn't know you were coming.

36:05.957 --> 36:09.168
Put it on, man!
We have to take her.

36:09.377 --> 36:10.419
Put that on.

36:11.587 --> 36:15.633
- Says who?
- Didn't I tell you to stay quiet?

36:15.716 --> 36:17.468
Just put it on.

36:31.315 --> 36:34.151
Pleasure to finally meet you,
Ms. Turbay.

36:35.653 --> 36:37.280
Sit down, please.

37:09.645 --> 37:11.856
I suppose you want me to interview you?

37:12.982 --> 37:15.401
Even better.

37:15.484 --> 37:18.112
I'm going to interview you.

37:18.321 --> 37:22.700
So you can tell the world about
the humane treatment you've received here.

37:27.580 --> 37:30.374
Don't you want your parents
to know you're well?

37:31.626 --> 37:33.419
That you're alive?

37:38.549 --> 37:41.969
I don't want to become
a piece of propaganda for you.

37:43.846 --> 37:45.306
Who do you think you are?

37:51.437 --> 37:55.483
So what's necessary, miss,
to have your cooperation?

38:03.491 --> 38:05.534
Let one of the hostages go.

38:09.455 --> 38:12.625
You and I know
that I'm the one you really want.

38:26.597 --> 38:28.057
You see?

38:28.724 --> 38:32.395
Two reasonable people
coming to an agreement.

38:33.771 --> 38:39.318
Maybe we can convince President Gaviria
to do the same. Right?

38:43.239 --> 38:46.534
Mr. Escobar has shown
a willingness to negotiate.

38:48.035 --> 38:51.205
This afternoon,
he let one of the hostages go.

38:51.288 --> 38:53.374
President Gaviria...

38:53.582 --> 38:59.088
<i>I ask you to at least
consider discussions with Mr. Escobar.</i>

39:04.468 --> 39:08.848
I don't understand. I thought you said
he wouldn't bend, but now he's let one go.

39:09.056 --> 39:11.183
Because he has your daughter.

39:11.267 --> 39:14.103
And she's worth more to him
than the rest of them combined.

39:15.813 --> 39:19.984
If you knew all I know, you'd understand
it's nothing more than a stunt.

39:20.192 --> 39:21.694
Give him what he wants.

39:21.777 --> 39:24.238
What he wants is an insult to us
and to this country.

39:24.447 --> 39:26.157
I don't care. I want my child!

39:26.365 --> 39:28.743
I believe what my wife
is trying to say is,

39:28.951 --> 39:32.663
we'd like you to make a deal with Escobar.

39:33.581 --> 39:37.043
If you refuse,
we'll have to take certain measures.

39:37.251 --> 39:43.591
Financially, by robbing you of donors...
and politically,

39:43.674 --> 39:48.512
by robbing you of whatever support
your legislative agenda needs.

39:52.516 --> 39:53.684
Are you threatening me?

39:54.560 --> 39:56.979
We all use the tools at our disposal.

39:57.063 --> 40:01.275
You as a politician, me as a father.
I'm sorry.

40:02.651 --> 40:04.028
Doctor...

40:05.279 --> 40:08.115
you told me to follow my instincts...

40:09.408 --> 40:12.620
and they tell me not to give in
to this criminal.

40:12.828 --> 40:15.164
That was before they took my daughter.

41:00.501 --> 41:04.255
I came over as quickly as I could.
I was told you needed me urgently.

41:04.338 --> 41:05.714
What's up?

41:08.050 --> 41:08.968
You OK?

41:13.222 --> 41:17.810
Tell Fernando...
I'm willing to open negotiations.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.648
We'll make a counter to Escobar's demands.

41:23.399 --> 41:25.401
I thought you weren't going to negotiate.

41:31.031 --> 41:33.033
I have to stop this madness.

41:34.827 --> 41:38.789
But God willing,
we can catch him first.

41:43.544 --> 41:46.755
Tell the Americans
they can put their planes in the air.

42:09.570 --> 42:10.779
What?

42:11.864 --> 42:13.324
Yes, we're here in Campo Valdés.

42:27.880 --> 42:30.758
We're gonna score a quick goal
and then come back out.

42:30.841 --> 42:32.968
All right, all right. All right.

42:35.971 --> 42:38.974
Don't kill me, please!

42:39.058 --> 42:42.937
I swear I didn't hear anything.
I'm not going to say anything.

42:43.020 --> 42:45.314
Please, don't kill me.

42:45.397 --> 42:47.149
- I'm not--
- Hey! Hey!

42:47.358 --> 42:50.736
- Please, don't kill me.
- What?

42:50.819 --> 42:53.822
I'm begging you, please...

42:58.035 --> 43:02.456
You could have at least waited
till I got her off me. Look at me now!

43:03.207 --> 43:05.334
You got blood all over my new shoes.

43:05.417 --> 43:08.629
I don't give a shit about your shoes.
Stop bitching.

43:09.838 --> 43:11.131
I'm not.

43:12.466 --> 43:13.425
What about her?

43:20.015 --> 43:21.392
Put a bullet in her.

43:27.189 --> 43:29.566
What? The baby's not a witness, man.

43:29.775 --> 43:31.819
I don't give a shit.

43:31.902 --> 43:34.655
- Pablo told us to kill everyone.
- Yeah, but it's a baby.

43:34.738 --> 43:36.991
She won't say shit in court.

43:37.825 --> 43:40.536
If she grows up and talks?

43:40.619 --> 43:43.998
Really? Do you remember
what your mom told you when you were two?

43:44.206 --> 43:49.336
Why is it so fucking difficult
for you to follow Pablo's orders?

45:48.080 --> 45:50.374
Drop the gun.

45:51.166 --> 45:52.793
Now!

46:00.259 --> 46:02.594
You're under arrest,
you son of a bitch.

46:03.262 --> 46:04.304
Let him go!

46:14.606 --> 46:15.607
Let him go!

46:15.816 --> 46:18.068
- Put the gun down.
- You put yours down.

46:19.319 --> 46:21.238
I don't want to have to kill you.

46:22.573 --> 46:23.407
I Will.

48:08.887 --> 48:12.391
So those fags
want to sit and negotiate.

48:14.268 --> 48:15.394
Well...

48:17.062 --> 48:19.481
we have to spend some time in jail, right?

48:19.565 --> 48:21.358
So what the fuck.

48:22.734 --> 48:25.362
You won, Pablo. They gave in.

48:25.445 --> 48:30.742
But that faggot president has yet
to accept our most important demand

48:30.826 --> 48:32.494
before we turn ourselves in.

48:33.412 --> 48:34.913
Which demand is that?

48:40.210 --> 48:42.254
It's been a while
since we've been up here, right?

48:42.337 --> 48:43.380
Yeah.

48:45.632 --> 48:49.094
We used to come up here
with our girlfriends and smoke a joint.

48:51.346 --> 48:53.557
What does that have to do with anything?

48:59.313 --> 49:02.983
I know every centimeter
of these mountains.

49:04.610 --> 49:08.322
From here,
we can see anything coming.

49:08.405 --> 49:12.034
And we have enough space
to build whatever we want.

49:14.202 --> 49:16.580
We're going to design it...

49:18.790 --> 49:20.709
we're going to build it...

49:22.127 --> 49:25.964
and we will be protected
from all our enemies.

49:28.216 --> 49:32.179
- You want to build a jail?
- Not a jail, cousin.

49:33.847 --> 49:35.474
A castle.
