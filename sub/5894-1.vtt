00:33.233 --> 00:34.633
What if we told you

00:34.635 --> 00:36.468
that there was no limit?

00:36.470 --> 00:39.071
That you could be
healthier, feel better

00:39.073 --> 00:42.074
and live longer
than ever before?

00:42.076 --> 00:46.278
What if we told you
your time is right now?

00:46.280 --> 00:50.282
At Sunskye, we don't just believe
in the future of science,

00:50.284 --> 00:52.751
we are the future of science.

00:52.753 --> 00:55.487
We search the planet for
the brightest people,

00:55.489 --> 00:57.523
the most impressive minds,

00:57.525 --> 01:00.125
and we put them to
work with one goal;

01:00.127 --> 01:03.328
To make your life
the best it can be.

01:03.330 --> 01:05.230
Headed by
world-renowned scientist

01:05.232 --> 01:08.300
and philanthropist
Professor Everitt Skye,

01:08.302 --> 01:12.638
Sunskye has 24 years of
researching experience.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.108
Over the next decade, our
hope is to rid the world

01:16.110 --> 01:19.278
of most sickness and
disease with the very latest

01:19.280 --> 01:21.747
and natural and
synthetic ingredients,

01:21.749 --> 01:24.183
we are creating medicines
that are changing

01:24.185 --> 01:27.152
the course of history
as we know it.

01:27.154 --> 01:29.688
As more and more
countries need our help,

01:29.690 --> 01:32.191
we are growing everyday.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.126
It doesn't matter where you live

01:34.128 --> 01:37.096
or when you need us,
we will be there.

01:37.098 --> 01:41.166
And with your help, we
can change tomorrow.

01:41.168 --> 01:42.501
I did it.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.303
I did it too.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.171
We all did it.

01:46.173 --> 01:48.340
Have you ever
wanted to be part of the future,

01:48.342 --> 01:51.477
to help human kind
take the next step?

01:51.479 --> 01:54.279
Well then, clinical
trials are for you.

01:54.281 --> 01:58.851
And now, it's your
time to do it too.

01:58.853 --> 02:00.893
Get involved today.

02:03.389 --> 02:05.290
I fucking hate that ad.

02:06.594 --> 02:10.162
I bet it has something
to do with these boxes.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.497
Presents!

02:11.499 --> 02:13.132
What do you think it is?

02:13.134 --> 02:14.633
It's a drug trial.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.667
Guess.

02:15.669 --> 02:16.802
I hate guessing games.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.138
I'm seriously terrible at them.

02:19.140 --> 02:21.473
They contain the
drugs for the trial.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.674
Oh right.

02:22.676 --> 02:25.277
Obviously.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.845
We just take them?

02:26.847 --> 02:29.181
And shouldn't they give
us more information?

02:29.183 --> 02:30.349
Yes, come on.

02:30.351 --> 02:33.452
The rep said it was
quick, easy money.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.753
Don't worry. I've
done heaps of these.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.555
They're easy as fuck.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.624
I opened my box guys.

02:38.626 --> 02:41.827
You just became my
favorite person in this room.

02:41.829 --> 02:42.761
Hello everyone.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.464
Welcome to test 1477-REMJG.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.765
I'm Dr. Everitt Skye.

02:46.767 --> 02:50.502
And thank you for coming
down on such short notice.

02:51.938 --> 02:53.572
I won't take much of your time.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.308
Just some rules and
regulations to get through.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.576
How did this go?

02:57.578 --> 02:58.310
Good?

02:58.312 --> 02:59.378
No?

02:59.380 --> 03:02.581
I'm just doing one
of these things.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.515
Sorry guys.

03:03.517 --> 03:07.219
So I hope you all found
today's location just fine

03:07.221 --> 03:10.589
and we are very sorry
for keeping you waiting.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.591
Please stop waving at me, sir.

03:12.593 --> 03:13.859
I can see you.

03:14.894 --> 03:16.728
So usually you'd
be in one of our

03:16.730 --> 03:19.965
regular lab testing
facilities but they were.

03:19.967 --> 03:24.636
The best we could find at short
notice was this sound studio

03:24.638 --> 03:26.672
which is actually
looking pretty good.

03:26.674 --> 03:30.776
So please don't touch
anything or move stuff around.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.544
You might get hurt.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.447
I actually think some famous
bands played in there.

03:36.916 --> 03:39.318
I wouldn't know because
I'm not really a music guy,

03:39.320 --> 03:41.687
but you can check the
website when you get home.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.922
It's very interesting.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.958
Anywho, please don't take
the pill at the same time.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.894
And the standard
eight-hour test will begin.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.629
The second that time hits
zero the doors will unlock

03:50.631 --> 03:52.564
and you're free to go home.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.399
Wait. What do you mean unlock?

03:55.868 --> 03:58.770
Oh, the doors must stay locked.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.306
Leaving the room
invalidates the data.

04:01.308 --> 04:02.674
You won't get paid.

04:02.676 --> 04:05.644
So pretty please,
don't go anywhere.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.779
So thanks for being part
of the future of science.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.348
You're all heroes in there.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.849
Fight for a better tomorrow.

04:10.851 --> 04:13.252
Have fun, all the
best and good luck.

04:14.854 --> 04:15.821
Wait.

04:15.823 --> 04:16.988
What if I get claustrophobic?

04:16.991 --> 04:17.990
Hello?

04:17.992 --> 04:19.791
Hello.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.294
Hey, there are
cameras everywhere.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.996
Don't steal.

04:23.998 --> 04:25.864
That's kleptomania.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.332
I get claustrophobic.

04:27.334 --> 04:29.301
It's fear of small spaces.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.870
You probably should've
done a clinical trial then.

04:31.872 --> 04:32.771
Don't worry.

04:32.773 --> 04:33.973
Those places are massive.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.409
Actually, it's
not as big, is it?

04:37.411 --> 04:39.311
It's actually quite
small, isn't it?

04:39.313 --> 04:41.680
It's like the walls are like
coming in you, aren't they?

04:41.682 --> 04:43.315
Wait, you get a little
bit sweat in your brow.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.816
Leave her alone, would you?

04:44.818 --> 04:46.852
Just a little bit
of fun, sweetheart.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.688
Eight hours in here together
should be pretty easy.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.323
So you've done this before?

04:51.325 --> 04:52.758
Yes, shitloads.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.059
You got any advice?

04:54.061 --> 04:56.528
Yeah, don't be a dickhead.

04:56.530 --> 05:00.332
Okay everyone,
let's take the pill.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.334
I wonder what it does to us.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.502
Imagine if it's
molly or something

05:03.504 --> 05:05.070
and we all get totally high.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.672
That'll be awesome.

05:06.674 --> 05:07.639
I wish.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.473
But it's not gonna do nothing.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.808
You see, we're control.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.710
I don't think you're right.

05:11.712 --> 05:12.978
And who are you?

05:16.916 --> 05:19.651
I think we're about to embark
on something really special.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.719
Energy in the room.

05:20.721 --> 05:21.987
He's one of them.

05:21.989 --> 05:25.390
Okay guys, let's just stop
talking and take the pill.

05:25.392 --> 05:27.392
And the timer won't
start until we do.

05:27.394 --> 05:28.694
What is control?

05:28.696 --> 05:29.795
Clinical trials have the two.

05:29.797 --> 05:32.698
And a placebo go to
the control group.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.032
We're control, no doubt.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.901
Then we might as
well not take it.

05:35.903 --> 05:40.939
Well, I never had to
go through so few hoops.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.543
One questionnaire, one
day's notice, bullshit.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.346
Who cares if it's a real
pill or a sugar pill.

05:47.348 --> 05:49.047
Let's just take the damn thing.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.682
Do I make myself clear?

05:50.684 --> 05:51.783
"Do I make myself clear?"

05:51.785 --> 05:53.352
Who made you boss man?

05:53.354 --> 05:54.786
Just open the box.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.054
Take out the pill.

06:07.434 --> 06:08.700
What one earth?

06:10.403 --> 06:12.838
Looks like crystals.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.639
Ah! It's so pretty.

06:14.641 --> 06:15.707
Seriously?

06:15.709 --> 06:17.109
What are doing?

06:17.111 --> 06:18.076
Stop, stop.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.544
Take the pill, come on.

06:19.546 --> 06:20.645
What pill?

06:22.915 --> 06:23.648
Oh em gee!

06:23.650 --> 06:24.883
What the hell?

06:26.986 --> 06:28.420
- You mean this one?
- Oh God!

06:28.422 --> 06:29.521
How did you do that?

06:29.523 --> 06:30.622
It's magic.

06:30.624 --> 06:31.656
Like for real?

06:32.658 --> 06:33.792
Sure.

06:33.794 --> 06:34.726
I don't know guys.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.894
This looks weird to me.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.730
We have to take it within a
few seconds of each other.

06:38.732 --> 06:43.602
It's literally the craziest
thing I've ever seen.

06:43.604 --> 06:44.903
Figuratively.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.738
What?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.974
Let's all take the
pill before this guy

06:48.976 --> 06:50.742
gets even more angry.

06:50.744 --> 06:51.710
My name is Devin.

06:51.712 --> 06:52.644
And yes, let's take it already.

06:52.646 --> 06:57.082
I mean, I know my pills if
you're catching my drift.

06:57.084 --> 06:57.983
I don't.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.084
What do you mean?

06:59.086 --> 07:00.819
Illegal drugs.

07:00.821 --> 07:01.653
Really?

07:01.655 --> 07:02.621
Yeah. Good, good.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.189
Now, just get it in your mouth.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.824
You sounded more like my ex.

07:05.826 --> 07:08.460
That dirty bitch doing
me before we quit.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.662
This is truly special.

07:10.664 --> 07:11.863
I don't care if you
think it's special.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.632
And I don't care about
your whore ex-wife.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.066
Oi, I can say it, mate.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.034
You can't.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.135
Calm down, Devin.

07:17.137 --> 07:21.039
I mean, have you ever seen
anything like that before?

07:21.041 --> 07:22.007
They're a business.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.575
What are they gonna do to us?

07:23.577 --> 07:24.676
All right, I'll calm down.

07:24.678 --> 07:27.045
Now, everyone let's
take the pill.

07:27.047 --> 07:27.846
You know what?

07:27.848 --> 07:32.717
I can't be late for this
new club opening tonight.

07:32.719 --> 07:34.219
Word is, this amazing
DJ is gonna be there...

07:34.221 --> 07:37.622
Can we hold the chatter
after we take the pill?

07:37.624 --> 07:39.791
Why are you so desperate
for us to take this?

07:39.793 --> 07:42.494
I just don't wanna
be in here all day.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.629
Okay, he's got a point.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.964
Everyone, open your water.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.165
Come on.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.901
Three, two, one.

07:59.045 --> 07:59.878
Not so bad, was it?

07:59.880 --> 08:00.812
Oh, that tasted awful.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.047
It was totally gross.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.081
Smooth.

08:06.753 --> 08:07.953
Oh God!

08:07.955 --> 08:09.888
Great, finally.

08:09.890 --> 08:12.090
And so the fun begins.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.558
Did you all see that?

08:15.127 --> 08:16.728
See what?

08:18.197 --> 08:19.731
Ah! Magic.

08:20.967 --> 08:23.201
I didn't do anything that time.

08:32.845 --> 08:35.013
Magic is all around us.

08:36.982 --> 08:38.549
It's time to relax.

08:39.719 --> 08:43.788
Enjoy the experience my
wonderful brothers and sisters.

08:59.171 --> 09:03.808
Water for hydration.

09:36.609 --> 09:37.842
Well, he's odd.

09:39.045 --> 09:41.005
I think I'm already feeling it.

09:42.214 --> 09:44.149
There's no way it
works that quick.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.184
No, my claustrophobia.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.320
Yeah, but you're here
now and you're not leaving.

09:48.322 --> 09:49.854
Relax, it's not long.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.190
I've had bowel movements
that last longer.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.272
What? You've taken
eight-hour shits?

09:55.661 --> 09:58.363
It's how I got through Lord
of the Rings and Harry Potter.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.799
Oh, you're a Harry Potter fan?

10:00.801 --> 10:03.802
Except I hate how they use
time travel to save Buckbeak.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.671
And then not use it to
save like, I don't know,

10:06.673 --> 10:08.306
every other loved
character in the book.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.809
I just think as soon as
we introduce time travel

10:10.811 --> 10:13.111
it becomes completely
impossible.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.113
You know it's not real, yeah?

10:15.115 --> 10:17.182
Yes, I know it's not real.

10:19.353 --> 10:22.153
I'm in this alleyway
behind a bar, right,

10:22.155 --> 10:23.388
with a couple of whores.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.322
Is this a joke?

10:24.324 --> 10:27.792
One these whores, she's
missing like half her leg.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.995
She said, "We're like run
over by a train or something,".

10:29.997 --> 10:33.031
Isn't it a little bit too
early for sex stories?

10:33.033 --> 10:35.166
Well, actually I wouldn't
mind hearing the rest.

10:35.168 --> 10:35.934
So she does this...

10:56.656 --> 10:59.224
You're pretty good.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.159
Three hours a day does that.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.167
Play a drum.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.902
Best way to get laid.

11:14.874 --> 11:15.555
God, please stop.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.011
Take off your pants.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.446
Take off your pants.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.915
Would you shut up?

11:25.351 --> 11:27.919
Better with a band anyway.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.387
I find that hard to believe.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.990
I liked it!

11:31.992 --> 11:33.058
Thanks.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.759
Hey guys.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.027
Look at all the effort
that they've put in

11:36.029 --> 11:38.196
to make this place a fortress.

11:39.265 --> 11:42.033
Especially considering the
pill ain't gonna do shit.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.868
I bet it's like collector study.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.970
You mean psychological study.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.873
What do you think
they'd be studying?

11:48.875 --> 11:52.811
I see three women can't resist
a lovely chap like myself.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.379
Yeah, it's not that.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.814
Maybe it's haunted.

11:55.816 --> 11:56.481
Oh em gee!

11:56.483 --> 11:57.482
Don't say that.

12:02.254 --> 12:04.155
Do you think they're
in there watching?

12:04.157 --> 12:05.924
Yep, guarantee it.

12:21.207 --> 12:24.476
Oh! Bad luck.

12:24.478 --> 12:27.278
Well, at least now they know
who's better at Tic-tac-toe.

12:27.280 --> 12:30.849
Oh! Think of all the useful
applications of that data.

12:45.064 --> 12:46.364
Really?

12:46.366 --> 12:48.366
You're obsessed.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.934
And you need balls.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.002
What?

12:52.104 --> 12:53.204
There.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.506
Now, you're
anatomically correct.

12:54.508 --> 12:55.373
Ew!

12:55.375 --> 12:56.941
Rub that off.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.377
I don't wanna stare
at a big dick all day.

13:00.346 --> 13:03.982
Oh! She says she doesn't
wanna stare at you all day.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.216
Very funny.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.824
Are we just gonna sit around?

13:12.826 --> 13:13.992
Can we do something?

13:13.994 --> 13:16.060
I wanna have fun.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.362
You guys.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.464
Okay, I got an idea.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.799
Come on.

13:20.801 --> 13:21.566
Gather around.

13:21.568 --> 13:22.834
Yes!

13:22.836 --> 13:23.401
Let's play a game.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.102
Wait, wait.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.403
Wait for me.

13:25.405 --> 13:28.807
We'll play for my lucky pen.

13:28.809 --> 13:29.841
It's gold-plated.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.442
Worth $1,400.

13:31.444 --> 13:35.280
There's only seven in
the world quite like it.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.015
Well, you got my attention.

13:37.017 --> 13:37.949
My name is John.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.818
Can I have your names, please?

13:39.820 --> 13:41.486
Well, you know I'm Devin.

13:41.488 --> 13:45.824
But my friends call me
JayZ, Jazz, Jezebel,

13:45.826 --> 13:48.193
the Jazz singer
Jizz and Jazzy JJ.

13:49.161 --> 13:49.994
What?

13:49.996 --> 13:51.429
They call you Jizz?

13:51.431 --> 13:52.964
We'll call you Jenna.

13:53.899 --> 13:55.033
And?

13:55.035 --> 13:56.201
I'm Nikki.

13:57.369 --> 13:58.570
I'm LI Xu Yeng,

13:58.572 --> 13:59.604
but no one really
likes saying that.

13:59.606 --> 14:02.073
So call me Lilly.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.008
Lilly it is.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.044
What about you, big guy?

14:06.046 --> 14:07.245
Just call me Giggles.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.413
Everyone else does.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.047
Giggles.

14:09.049 --> 14:09.581
Really?

14:09.583 --> 14:12.617
Well, I haven't seen
you giggle once.

14:12.619 --> 14:14.853
Wait, is it one of
those ironic names

14:14.855 --> 14:16.888
like where you
call a fat guy Slim

14:16.890 --> 14:19.157
or a tall guy Tiny?

14:19.159 --> 14:22.126
Keep that smile
you'll find out why.

14:23.495 --> 14:25.029
Okay.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.631
And you, my quiet friend?

14:28.334 --> 14:30.101
Hey buddy, what's your name?

14:33.405 --> 14:34.339
Hello?

14:35.342 --> 14:36.608
Okay.

14:36.610 --> 14:38.309
We're gonna have
to give him a name.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.644
How about Greg?

14:39.646 --> 14:41.079
No way!

14:41.081 --> 14:45.183
I know like 50 Gregs
and he is not a Greg.

14:45.185 --> 14:48.419
I think we should
call him Blue Eyes.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.388
I'm not calling him Blue Eyes.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.357
Let's just call
him Chilled Guy.

14:52.359 --> 14:55.226
You're not really known
for your creativity, are you?

14:55.228 --> 14:58.029
He kind of reminds me of
a guy I went to school with.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.597
His name was Corey.

14:59.599 --> 15:00.465
Corey.

15:00.467 --> 15:01.466
I like it.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.534
Yeah, my suggestion was fine.

15:03.536 --> 15:04.569
Okay.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.304
Hand up for Chill Guy.

15:07.907 --> 15:08.947
Hand up for Corey.

15:12.978 --> 15:14.245
Corey it is.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.187
Okay, the game is this.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.557
If you can beat me in
a game of code reading,

15:26.559 --> 15:29.160
I will give you my shiny pen.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.094
Oh my God!

15:30.096 --> 15:31.496
I am amazing at games.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.398
I literally never lose.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.499
Literally?

15:34.501 --> 15:35.667
Yep.

15:35.669 --> 15:37.135
Okay, moving on.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.169
If you haven't noticed,

15:38.171 --> 15:40.672
I'm a magician, and a mentalist.

15:40.674 --> 15:44.575
And with only a few
moments, and a glance,

15:44.577 --> 15:47.245
into your eyes,
and your very soul,

15:47.247 --> 15:49.280
I can tell you everything
there is about you.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.417
If I get you wrong,
you get my pen.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.351
Fuck it!

15:53.353 --> 15:54.553
I'm bored as shit anyway.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.054
You're not gonna get me.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.221
Come on.

15:57.223 --> 15:58.222
Okay.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.427
This should be easy.

16:02.429 --> 16:03.695
You're an ex-con.

16:03.697 --> 16:05.229
You came here to start anew

16:05.231 --> 16:07.432
but it's hard to find
work as an ex-con.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.701
So you do this test
to pay the bills.

16:09.703 --> 16:13.071
The real question is, what'd
you do that was so bad

16:13.073 --> 16:15.273
that you can't go home?

16:15.275 --> 16:17.108
It wasn't small time.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.010
It was big.

16:19.012 --> 16:21.045
And you didn't steal anything.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.751
All right, just
do someone else.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.119
Do I get to keep my pen?

16:28.121 --> 16:28.720
Yeah, fuck it!

16:28.722 --> 16:30.321
Keep your pen.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.456
Wonderful.

16:32.624 --> 16:34.025
Do her next.

16:34.027 --> 16:38.463
Drug problem, stripper,
probably got a sugar daddy.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.998
Um, excuse me!

16:40.000 --> 16:41.399
How dare you?

16:41.401 --> 16:43.701
I do not like gross, old men.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.004
Oh, it's just not
your day, is it?

16:47.539 --> 16:48.706
Jenna.

16:50.109 --> 16:52.276
No, you don't have
a sugar daddy.

16:53.479 --> 16:56.280
You're just a girl who
doesn't want the party to end.

16:56.282 --> 16:57.582
But maybe you ran out of money

16:57.584 --> 17:00.218
and maybe your dad won't
help you out this time.

17:00.220 --> 17:03.287
Either way, there's no way
you could be a stripper.

17:03.289 --> 17:06.424
Okay, first of
all, you're amazing.

17:07.492 --> 17:10.094
And second of all,
it's totally offensive

17:10.096 --> 17:11.628
to say I couldn't be stripper.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.365
Just for the record, I'd
be an amazing stripper.

17:14.367 --> 17:18.301
Well, I'm really sorry
that I offended you.

17:19.405 --> 17:24.474
Devin, you either just lost
your job or you got a divorce.

17:26.377 --> 17:27.512
Both.

17:27.513 --> 17:28.346
It's impossible.

17:28.348 --> 17:29.514
How could you know that?

17:29.516 --> 17:30.782
Do I keep my pen?

17:30.784 --> 17:31.482
How the hell...

17:32.786 --> 17:33.651
Excuse you.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.053
Ew!

17:35.055 --> 17:36.621
Sorry.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.289
Is that the pill?

17:38.291 --> 17:39.123
I told you, mate.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.258
It's not the pill.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.260
Oh, it just taste really off.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.465
Okay, moving on.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.268
Let's do the very
mysterious Nikki.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.636
Please don't do me.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.538
Oh, you sound like
the exact opposite

17:53.540 --> 17:55.173
of Giggles' ex-girlfriend.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.541
Oi, I can say it.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.142
You guys can't.

17:58.144 --> 17:58.810
Yeah.

17:58.812 --> 17:59.677
Seriously, John, not me.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.179
Come on.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.281
You're the most
intriguing person in here.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.348
Yeah, and the most private.

18:04.350 --> 18:05.750
Just let it go, okay?

18:07.619 --> 18:09.787
You guys seriously
not getting that too?

18:09.789 --> 18:10.755
Get what, mate?

18:10.757 --> 18:12.457
Put your hand over your mouth.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.257
No, idiot.

18:13.259 --> 18:18.162
It's like an intense push
of gas from your stomach.

18:18.164 --> 18:19.764
I don't feel it.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.806
I'll give you
something to feel.

18:22.334 --> 18:22.867
Goody!

18:22.869 --> 18:24.302
A penis joke.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.270
How often do you those
actually get you laid?

18:26.272 --> 18:29.340
Maybe hangout with me after
the test and you'll find out.

18:29.342 --> 18:30.475
Oh God!

18:30.477 --> 18:32.110
That's awful.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.278
Maybe the pill
worked on me first.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.115
It's like the gas, it's
like a sulfur flavor.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.616
Just look after it.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.118
Let me know if you get it.

18:42.754 --> 18:45.389
Well, I think I felt
something in my boobs.

18:46.525 --> 18:47.225
No, wait.

18:47.227 --> 18:47.725
It's gone.

18:47.727 --> 18:48.659
I'm fine.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.394
I felt the boob thing too.

18:51.463 --> 18:54.232
Maybe this pill
ain't so bad after all.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.134
They're half your age.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.435
What do you mean?

18:57.437 --> 18:58.803
Grass on the field.

19:00.172 --> 19:01.305
Oh!

19:02.374 --> 19:03.741
Okay.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.777
On that note, I'm gonna
go throw up in my mouth

19:06.779 --> 19:07.745
and play some poker.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.181
Does anyone wanna join me?

19:20.759 --> 19:22.393
Okay, what do you got?

19:23.695 --> 19:24.862
Nice.

19:25.864 --> 19:27.765
A royal flush.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.400
That never happens.

19:30.903 --> 19:31.702
Really?

19:31.704 --> 19:32.637
Nothing.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.540
Aren't you impressed
by how well I cheat?

19:35.542 --> 19:37.208
Who gets impressed by cheaters?

19:37.210 --> 19:38.442
It's a royal flush.

19:38.444 --> 19:39.644
I mean, how did I do it?

19:39.646 --> 19:40.945
Who cares?

19:40.947 --> 19:43.381
One person cheats and
it ruins the whole game.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.550
My dad used to cheat
when we played Monopoly.

19:45.552 --> 19:50.621
I thought that Australian
girls love magic.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.690
I don't know what
else I have to offer.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.258
Well, you better think
of something quick.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.626
I'm starting to lose interest.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.795
Did you just admit
that you're interested?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.797
And the interest gone.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.232
I must be off my game.

20:01.234 --> 20:04.402
It's only been an hour?

20:04.404 --> 20:09.807
Maybe it's because you're
having more fun than you think.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.409
Maybe.

20:12.811 --> 20:14.412
So why are you doing
this test anyway?

20:14.414 --> 20:16.681
You seem a little out of place.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.983
I'm just a really
big fan of science.

20:19.751 --> 20:20.952
Just tell me.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.823
Well, honestly?

20:25.825 --> 20:27.491
So I can meet you.

20:28.493 --> 20:29.427
Sorry.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.429
Now, tell me or you'll
get another one.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.964
Okay, okay, okay.

20:32.966 --> 20:35.533
Have you ever
played poker before

20:35.535 --> 20:40.638
and maybe lost more
money than you had?

20:40.640 --> 20:41.672
No.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.241
Well, that makes one of us.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.575
So why don't you just cheat?

20:44.577 --> 20:45.509
I did.

20:45.511 --> 20:47.378
It didn't work out so well.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.413
And now you're stuck
in here with these guys.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.249
Serves you right.

20:53.552 --> 20:55.820
Yeah, I think we
definitely have chemistry.

20:55.822 --> 20:56.921
No, you idiot.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.689
I meant with the pill.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.659
I knew what you meant and no.

21:02.728 --> 21:04.562
I thought I was
feeling something a bit.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.530
Maybe it's just in my head.

21:06.532 --> 21:07.398
I think Giggles might be right.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.767
I think it's a placebo.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.603
I swear I just heard
you say I was right.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.472
What's my price then?

21:14.474 --> 21:16.554
Aw! I wanna knee
you in the balls.

21:17.576 --> 21:19.010
That's a good price.

21:19.012 --> 21:20.978
It's not a placebo.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.546
I feel like shit.

21:23.916 --> 21:26.884
Getting that gassy
taste in their mouth.

21:26.886 --> 21:27.752
Give it up, mate.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.353
It's not the pill.

21:29.355 --> 21:31.856
Oh, do you find the
inside of your mouth

21:31.858 --> 21:33.491
taste pretty unpleasant?

21:33.493 --> 21:35.726
Do you yearn for the
taste of rotten eggs?

21:35.728 --> 21:37.461
Oh, your prayers
have been answered.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.363
All new sulfur mouth wash.

21:39.365 --> 21:40.665
Don't leave home without it.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.500
Hair loss, anal leakage

21:42.502 --> 21:44.368
and homosexual dreams.

21:44.370 --> 21:45.036
Oh all right.

21:45.038 --> 21:46.370
I get it.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.073
Are you okay?

21:49.075 --> 21:50.341
Yeah, are you all done?

21:50.343 --> 21:51.609
Don't get annoyed.

21:51.611 --> 21:52.877
Just a bit of fun, mate.

21:52.879 --> 21:53.678
Yeah, yeah.

21:53.680 --> 21:54.512
Very funny.

22:25.043 --> 22:25.776
Let me out!

22:25.778 --> 22:30.014
Let me out!

22:30.016 --> 22:31.782
Open the fucking door!

22:32.618 --> 22:34.552
Open this fucking door!

22:34.554 --> 22:37.088
Open this fucking door!

22:37.090 --> 22:39.023
He's become one with the air.

22:44.730 --> 22:45.463
Wait!

22:45.465 --> 22:45.996
I can hear them.

22:45.998 --> 22:46.764
Open the door.

22:46.766 --> 22:49.433
Open up!

22:49.435 --> 22:50.101
Oh my God!

22:50.103 --> 22:51.068
You have to let us out!

22:51.070 --> 22:52.470
Why won't they open it?

22:52.472 --> 22:53.637
Okay, come on!

22:55.974 --> 22:57.141
Hey, Corey,
whatever your name is.

22:57.143 --> 22:57.975
Help us.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.143
Fuck him!

23:02.914 --> 23:04.782
Push it! Push it!

23:04.784 --> 23:06.984
Fucking get out of the way.

23:06.986 --> 23:08.119
Look out!

23:10.723 --> 23:11.922
The fuck!

23:16.027 --> 23:17.495
What was that?

23:17.497 --> 23:18.529
Okay.

23:18.531 --> 23:19.964
We should just...

23:19.966 --> 23:21.065
Oh my God!

23:21.067 --> 23:21.999
Oh my God!

23:22.001 --> 23:23.667
Shh, shh, shh.

23:27.739 --> 23:29.039
They're gone.

23:29.041 --> 23:29.774
Where did they go?

23:29.776 --> 23:30.708
No, no, no.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.943
They're just figuring
out how to open the door.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.678
Open this fucking door!

23:34.680 --> 23:36.747
Can you see me?

23:36.749 --> 23:39.784
Does anybody else have a
gassy taste in their mouth?

23:39.786 --> 23:43.554
Well, everyone just relax
and take a deep goddamn breath?

23:43.556 --> 23:44.555
Wait, wait.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.924
Can we all throw up?

23:48.493 --> 23:49.894
No, the pill's in
our body's too long.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.095
It's too late.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.029
Anyway we already saw
it work which means

23:52.031 --> 23:53.898
it's a quick acting drug.

23:53.900 --> 23:54.765
I know these things.

23:54.767 --> 23:55.733
Trust me.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.535
I'm getting us out of here.

23:57.537 --> 23:59.136
Fuck!

24:10.048 --> 24:12.516
What is this fucking place?

24:12.518 --> 24:13.984
I'm not getting a signal.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.186
You have your phone?

24:15.188 --> 24:16.654
It's not getting a signal.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.622
Get out of the fucking way.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.601
What is this fucking thing?

24:32.938 --> 24:34.004
Help!

24:34.006 --> 24:35.506
Help!

24:35.508 --> 24:38.576
Jenna, Jenna, please
we're in a sound studio.

24:38.578 --> 24:39.810
The door is closed, all right?

24:39.812 --> 24:40.744
So?

24:40.746 --> 24:41.479
So?

24:41.481 --> 24:42.112
Are you serious?

24:42.114 --> 24:43.814
Nobody can hear you.

24:43.816 --> 24:48.652
I mean, where would you put
a bunch of exploding people?

24:48.654 --> 24:50.087
Seriously?

24:50.089 --> 24:51.889
I'm not even
supposed to be here.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.491
Why does this have to be me?

24:53.493 --> 24:56.160
Tonight, this agent was
gonna be there at this party.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.094
My dad...

24:57.096 --> 24:58.863
Jenna, don't lose your shit!

24:59.832 --> 25:00.831
There might be a way outta here.

25:00.833 --> 25:01.899
Fuck me!

25:01.901 --> 25:03.634
Hey, over here.

25:03.636 --> 25:04.902
I found something.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.139
Give us your phone.

25:09.141 --> 25:10.975
Give us your fucking phone.

25:11.977 --> 25:14.545
Don't like use all the battery.

25:17.582 --> 25:19.216
Fucking hell.

25:20.552 --> 25:21.886
Watch where you're going.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.041
There's a door.

25:45.810 --> 25:47.044
It's open.

25:52.684 --> 25:53.951
What the fuck!

25:56.621 --> 25:57.755
Fuck!

25:58.823 --> 26:00.724
Fuck!

26:04.229 --> 26:05.696
We're not getting out of here.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.302
Well, I'm not giving up yet.

26:11.304 --> 26:13.270
Everybody, empty your pockets.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.774
Guys, really, just relax.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.275
Come and sit with
me, my friends.

26:18.277 --> 26:19.677
Let's meditate.

26:19.679 --> 26:20.344
I got it.

26:20.346 --> 26:21.145
What?

26:21.147 --> 26:24.181
Don't people always break out
of prison with these things?

26:24.183 --> 26:25.616
This isn't gold-plated.

26:25.618 --> 26:29.053
Does that really
matter right now?

26:29.055 --> 26:30.321
Okay, so what's the plan?

26:30.323 --> 26:31.055
- Do we just...
- No?

26:31.057 --> 26:33.757
They have to open the door
after eight hours, right?

26:33.759 --> 26:34.358
All right.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.260
Devin exploded.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.762
And they bloody locked us in.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.864
My parents don't
even know I'm here.

26:41.900 --> 26:43.934
Wait, nobody knows
that I'm here either.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.069
I'm passing through town.

26:45.071 --> 26:46.170
What about you guys?

26:46.172 --> 26:48.305
I'm passing through, too.

26:49.674 --> 26:51.208
They fucking knew.

26:52.210 --> 26:55.079
Does anyone have anybody
that knows that you're here?

26:55.081 --> 26:58.115
Somebody that'll come for you?

26:58.117 --> 27:00.351
They fucking knew.

27:00.353 --> 27:02.186
Okay, seriously guys.

27:02.188 --> 27:04.188
You're actually not
allowed to do this.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.289
It is so illegal.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.824
When my dad finds out,

27:06.826 --> 27:08.626
I mean what the hell!

27:08.628 --> 27:10.294
You better open up right now!

27:10.296 --> 27:12.329
Open up or you will
seriously regret it!

27:12.331 --> 27:13.697
Jenna, please.

27:13.699 --> 27:14.331
We get it.

27:14.333 --> 27:15.132
No, John.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.066
I'm sorry, but no.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.334
You can't do this to people.

27:17.336 --> 27:20.037
This is literally the
worst moment of my life.

27:20.039 --> 27:22.200
Well, you're finally
using literally right.

27:23.208 --> 27:24.341
Chill out, babes.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.783
I'm seriously getting
us out of here.

27:32.083 --> 27:34.118
Did you all see that?

27:34.120 --> 27:35.653
Did anyone else see that?

27:37.022 --> 27:37.921
What happened?

27:37.923 --> 27:39.256
How did I get here?

27:39.258 --> 27:40.991
Magic.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.026
Oh my God!

27:42.028 --> 27:43.327
Oh my God!

27:43.329 --> 27:45.729
It looked like you...

27:45.731 --> 27:46.830
What did I do?

27:46.832 --> 27:47.731
Teleported.

27:47.733 --> 27:48.265
What?

27:48.267 --> 27:49.099
What is that?

27:49.101 --> 27:49.833
What's a teleport?

27:49.835 --> 27:50.334
I don't know.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.268
You tell me.

27:51.270 --> 27:54.304
I just, I didn't wanna
fall so I had like a reflex

27:54.306 --> 27:58.308
to be somewhere else,
and then I totally was.

27:58.310 --> 28:00.310
That's impossible.

28:00.312 --> 28:02.246
I can't teleport.

28:02.248 --> 28:05.449
Either you get the exploding
pill or the teleport one.

28:08.720 --> 28:12.856
If she can teleport, it means
you can get us outta here.

28:12.858 --> 28:13.424
Yes.

28:13.426 --> 28:14.024
What?

28:14.026 --> 28:14.958
No, no.

28:14.960 --> 28:15.893
I don't know how I did it.

28:15.895 --> 28:16.326
I don't even know what it is.

28:16.328 --> 28:17.127
Jenna.

28:17.129 --> 28:17.828
No!

28:17.830 --> 28:18.796
No way.

28:18.798 --> 28:19.730
Ow!

28:19.732 --> 28:20.264
Get your hands off her.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.065
What the hell?

28:21.067 --> 28:22.299
Help me teleport.

28:22.301 --> 28:24.001
That really hurt you
fucking douche fucker.

28:24.003 --> 28:25.202
I didn't even do it.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.103
Do not push me.

28:26.105 --> 28:27.337
That is so not okay.

28:27.339 --> 28:28.939
You've already lost the power.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.340
Pretty shitty then.

28:31.443 --> 28:32.176
You okay?

28:32.178 --> 28:36.013
Jenna, you need to
try and do it again.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.414
I mean just start small.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.783
Go from one side of
the room to the other.

28:39.785 --> 28:40.818
What if that's what Devin did

28:40.820 --> 28:42.186
and that's why he blew off?

28:42.188 --> 28:44.121
Plus, I don't know how.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.856
I don't know how
to teleport either,

28:45.858 --> 28:47.991
but you gotta give it a go.

28:47.993 --> 28:48.826
Oh my God.

28:48.828 --> 28:49.727
I'm so fucking freaked.

28:49.729 --> 28:50.360
No, no.

28:50.362 --> 28:50.994
You can do this Jenna.

28:50.996 --> 28:51.729
Come on.

28:51.731 --> 28:52.691
Please, Jenna.

28:59.104 --> 29:01.305
Fucking come on!

29:01.307 --> 29:02.172
Shut up!

29:02.174 --> 29:03.240
It's not that...

29:04.809 --> 29:06.009
easy.

29:07.946 --> 29:09.780
You fucking beauty.

29:09.782 --> 29:10.447
Amazing!

29:10.449 --> 29:12.149
You figured it out.

29:12.151 --> 29:12.983
Yeah.

29:12.985 --> 29:14.084
It's hard to explain.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.786
It feels better the second time.

29:15.788 --> 29:16.520
Amazing!

29:16.522 --> 29:18.122
I might be able to control it.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.790
There is a principle
in quantum mechanics

29:19.792 --> 29:21.959
that says teleportation
is theoretically possible

29:21.961 --> 29:24.962
but this, I mean, you realize
you're the first person

29:24.964 --> 29:26.296
in history to do that.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.264
Really?

29:27.266 --> 29:28.365
Am I gonna be famous?

29:28.367 --> 29:29.233
Forget about famous.

29:29.235 --> 29:30.100
You just teleported.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.436
Well, you're not
gonna be anything

29:32.438 --> 29:33.537
if we're still stuck in here.

29:33.539 --> 29:36.140
Okay, I'll do it and
then we are gonna kick

29:36.142 --> 29:38.475
some serious scientist ass.

29:38.477 --> 29:41.178
Oh, don't teleport
where someone is, yeah?

29:41.180 --> 29:42.312
Not where I'm standing?

29:42.314 --> 29:43.113
Don't.

29:43.115 --> 29:43.947
Just don't.

29:43.949 --> 29:44.848
I can do this, guys.

29:44.850 --> 29:45.516
Yes, you can.

29:45.518 --> 29:46.917
Okay.

29:49.487 --> 29:51.255
Actually, can I get
some water first?

29:51.257 --> 29:51.922
Yeah.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.023
Okay.

29:56.995 --> 29:58.328
Thanks.

29:58.330 --> 29:59.096
Wait, Jenna.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.932
Did I make something
disappear from my face?

30:01.934 --> 30:02.866
What?

30:02.868 --> 30:03.500
Is there something on my face?

30:03.502 --> 30:04.542
Seriously, tell me.

30:05.303 --> 30:06.270
The water.

30:06.272 --> 30:09.006
Did you teleport this
from somewhere else?

30:09.008 --> 30:10.140
I don't know.

30:10.142 --> 30:11.909
I didn't feel at that time.

30:11.911 --> 30:15.445
Technically, it's possible
if teleportation is possible

30:15.447 --> 30:17.815
which I guess it is.

30:17.817 --> 30:20.017
Oh, you bloody think.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.885
What is this pill doing to me?

30:21.887 --> 30:23.220
I don't know but I
don't think we should wait

30:23.222 --> 30:24.555
to find out what it
does to everybody else.

30:24.557 --> 30:26.223
We need to get out of here now.

30:26.225 --> 30:28.058
Okay, you're totally right.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.226
Okay.

30:29.228 --> 30:30.260
I can do this.

30:30.262 --> 30:31.495
Yes.

30:32.263 --> 30:34.131
I'm just gonna do it
and then I'm gonna home

30:34.133 --> 30:35.999
and take a serious
fucking shower.

30:36.001 --> 30:36.900
Yeah, that's a good idea.

30:36.902 --> 30:38.468
Okay.

30:38.470 --> 30:39.837
Don't fuck up, yeah?

30:41.206 --> 30:42.573
Ah! Shit!

30:42.575 --> 30:43.607
It didn't work.

30:44.944 --> 30:46.076
What?

30:46.078 --> 30:47.511
Now, is there
something on my face?

30:47.513 --> 30:48.512
Seriously, tell...

30:55.620 --> 30:56.553
Oh no.

30:57.322 --> 30:58.388
Jenna.

31:01.426 --> 31:03.060
Jenna, put your arm back.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.294
This can't be happening.

31:05.196 --> 31:06.363
Jenna.

31:06.365 --> 31:07.397
Teleport it back.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.932
Come on.

31:08.934 --> 31:09.933
Is she doing it?

31:09.935 --> 31:11.401
Jenna.

31:16.374 --> 31:18.141
No, no.

31:20.111 --> 31:21.078
She's gone.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.012
No.

31:22.014 --> 31:23.280
You're fucking kidding me.

31:23.282 --> 31:24.281
No.

31:27.418 --> 31:30.554
The pill, it's killing us.

31:33.958 --> 31:35.259
What have you done?

31:48.273 --> 31:49.640
This can't be happening.

31:52.977 --> 31:54.378
Why is this happening?

31:56.648 --> 31:57.581
Come on.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.349
Nothing to be done.

32:00.518 --> 32:01.952
Come on, John,
let's clean this up.

32:01.954 --> 32:03.453
Don't touch me!

32:04.522 --> 32:06.523
Easy there, Johnny boy.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.058
She's gone.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.459
We'll just clean it up, eh?

32:24.176 --> 32:25.409
Hey, careful.

32:25.411 --> 32:26.209
What?

32:26.211 --> 32:27.477
She can't feel it.

32:28.646 --> 32:30.414
She can't.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.316
When I teleport I'm
gonna be good at it.

32:32.318 --> 32:33.550
Fucking airhead.

32:33.552 --> 32:34.718
I knew she'd stuff it up.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.619
What is wrong with you?

32:35.621 --> 32:37.087
She is dead.

32:42.994 --> 32:44.561
Five hours on the clock.

32:47.165 --> 32:49.733
It feels like we've only
been in here for an hour.

32:53.705 --> 32:55.405
Can I give you a hand?

32:55.407 --> 32:57.107
No, it's pretty much done.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.271
Please stop doing that.

33:29.607 --> 33:31.441
Stop it.

33:31.443 --> 33:34.044
I'm the only one smart
enough to get us out of here.

33:34.579 --> 33:37.614
Always leading, always
thinking for someone else.

33:37.616 --> 33:40.017
Then do it quietly.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.219
Can you stop being
such a little baby?

33:42.221 --> 33:43.587
As soon as I learn to teleport,

33:43.589 --> 33:45.489
you'll be licking
my balls in thanks.

33:45.491 --> 33:47.257
Giggles, seriously stop.

33:47.259 --> 33:51.361
Oh please, I'm gonna eat
you for fucking breakfast.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.764
Why did you give her the pill?

33:53.766 --> 33:55.165
But you know what?

33:55.167 --> 33:56.633
Fuck you!

34:01.372 --> 34:04.241
What's the point of
your test now fuckers?

34:04.243 --> 34:08.712
Hey, Giggly man, why are
you so filled with anger?

34:09.647 --> 34:12.649
Why don't you just
fucking explode?

34:12.650 --> 34:14.684
No more fucking test.

34:14.686 --> 34:15.819
Well, that's not very nice.

34:16.655 --> 34:18.388
Giggles, enough.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.590
You really think you
can make the pill work?

34:24.328 --> 34:25.629
What the hell was that?

34:38.076 --> 34:38.809
What's happening?

34:38.811 --> 34:40.210
Some thing's coming through.

34:41.212 --> 34:42.679
It's breaking.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.214
Come on fuckers.

34:46.819 --> 34:49.485
Come on and fight
me you fuckers!

34:54.592 --> 34:55.759
Where did it go?

34:58.463 --> 35:00.430
What was that?

35:00.432 --> 35:01.298
I pissed them off.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.466
Good.

35:02.468 --> 35:03.400
Let them come in
and deal with me.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.168
That wasn't the scientist.

35:05.170 --> 35:06.169
Oh no.

35:06.171 --> 35:07.337
It was me.

35:09.807 --> 35:10.841
Oh, fuck me dead.

35:10.843 --> 35:12.709
Look what the pill did to you.

35:14.479 --> 35:16.113
And it's shit.

35:16.115 --> 35:18.248
You can turn water
into different colors.

35:19.684 --> 35:21.518
You're like a shitty Jesus.

35:22.820 --> 35:25.122
I didn't even try.

35:25.124 --> 35:27.457
I mean, I could
feel it happening

35:27.459 --> 35:31.394
but I don't know, it's
like this surge of power.

35:31.396 --> 35:32.829
Can you control it?

35:32.831 --> 35:34.131
I don't know.

35:36.167 --> 35:37.667
You have magic inside of you.

35:38.703 --> 35:40.504
You're very lucky.

35:40.506 --> 35:41.338
Excuse me?

35:41.340 --> 35:42.739
You think we're lucky?

35:42.741 --> 35:44.307
Yeah.

35:44.309 --> 35:48.478
What is inside of us,
it's out of this world.

35:49.447 --> 35:50.680
I think it's a gift.

35:51.682 --> 35:53.683
Well, that gift just
killed two people.

35:53.685 --> 35:56.686
Well, not every gift is
for every person, brother.

35:58.923 --> 36:01.424
Look, whatever's inside
of us is more powerful

36:01.426 --> 36:04.427
than anything that any
of us could ever imagine.

36:04.429 --> 36:06.196
And that's why we
need to be careful.

36:06.198 --> 36:08.865
That's why we need to
stick together as a group.

36:11.569 --> 36:14.304
Where can they figure out
how to give us abilities?

36:15.573 --> 36:18.275
We're like the new
evolution of science.

36:20.578 --> 36:23.180
We're like the
first super humans.

36:23.182 --> 36:24.414
Superheroes.

36:25.483 --> 36:27.517
Fucking superheroes.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.820
Hey, are you all right?

36:31.723 --> 36:35.392
I guess the clock's
began to tick on me.

36:35.394 --> 36:37.260
Probably not long to live.

36:37.262 --> 36:38.495
You don't know that.

36:40.565 --> 36:42.365
Two people in this
room have had the pill

36:42.367 --> 36:44.201
work for them and
they both died.

36:44.203 --> 36:45.869
It can't be controlled.

36:51.542 --> 36:55.645
If you get out of here,
I need you to tell my dad

36:55.647 --> 36:57.447
that I was coming back.

36:58.649 --> 37:00.317
I just needed to get away.

37:02.553 --> 37:04.321
Just tell him I'm sorry.

37:05.423 --> 37:07.503
You gotta promise
me you'll do that.

37:08.526 --> 37:09.559
Sure.

37:11.395 --> 37:12.629
How would I find him?

37:14.398 --> 37:16.833
John, stop playing dumb.

37:16.835 --> 37:18.468
You didn't just code
read this group.

37:18.470 --> 37:19.302
I saw you.

37:19.304 --> 37:20.870
Saw him do what?

37:20.872 --> 37:25.508
He sneaked in to a room and
looked through our files.

37:25.510 --> 37:28.311
You read our questionnaire?

37:28.313 --> 37:30.814
I had some really
private stuff in there.

37:32.283 --> 37:34.317
No wonder you knew
all that shit about us.

37:34.319 --> 37:36.453
No, you I guessed.

37:36.455 --> 37:37.787
Dickhead.

37:37.789 --> 37:41.024
You have a big fucking
dick on your head.

37:41.026 --> 37:41.992
And colorgirl.

37:41.994 --> 37:45.562
Oh, how dumb is
your fucking power?

37:45.564 --> 37:47.464
Yeah, we'll see what you get.

37:47.466 --> 37:49.399
I'm gonna choose my power.

37:51.636 --> 37:53.737
Hey, what are you doing?

37:53.739 --> 37:55.905
I choose that mind control one.

37:55.907 --> 37:56.606
What?

37:56.608 --> 37:57.574
Telekinesis.

37:57.576 --> 37:59.009
What did you call me?

37:59.011 --> 38:01.544
It's the name of
that power, dumb-ass.

38:01.546 --> 38:02.746
What are you muttering?

38:02.748 --> 38:03.980
Nothing.

38:04.915 --> 38:07.884
None of that color
bullshit or flying.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.552
Why does anyone wanna fly?

38:09.554 --> 38:10.687
And people don't know this.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.355
We can already fly.

38:12.357 --> 38:14.024
It's pretty inexpensive too.

38:14.026 --> 38:16.760
And you get a movie
and a free meal.

38:16.762 --> 38:17.761
That makes no sense.

38:17.763 --> 38:19.896
You don't get to choose.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.965
What the fuck would you know?

38:23.501 --> 38:27.937
If I can move this pear,
I can move anything.

38:27.939 --> 38:30.540
And I can open the
door and I'm free.

38:30.542 --> 38:33.376
You know what I'm gonna
do as soon as I get out?

38:33.378 --> 38:35.712
I'm gonna go straight
down to the nearest bank

38:35.714 --> 38:38.581
and I'm gonna move that money
straight into my pockets.

38:39.851 --> 38:42.919
I'm gonna pick out
the prettiest girl,

38:42.921 --> 38:45.622
I'm gonna move her straight
on the end of my knob.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.590
So your plan is to rape people.

38:47.592 --> 38:48.925
It's not rape.

38:48.927 --> 38:53.463
On the subject of
telekinesis rape, are you?

38:53.465 --> 38:54.431
You know what?

38:54.433 --> 38:55.432
You could all sit around here

38:55.434 --> 38:57.033
with your dicks in your hands.

38:57.035 --> 38:58.802
I'm getting outta here.

39:07.044 --> 39:08.445
Fuck!

39:11.549 --> 39:12.882
Don't throw food.

39:18.656 --> 39:20.023
Nikki?

39:20.025 --> 39:23.626
All this talk and I can't
stop thinking about it.

39:24.829 --> 39:26.596
Oh, I think I need to use it.

39:27.598 --> 39:29.099
Don't change people or nothing.

39:29.101 --> 39:31.568
I mean don't tell me black
or any shit like that.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.436
Just shut up.

39:33.438 --> 39:34.637
Hey, are you okay?

39:36.574 --> 39:37.774
Did you use it?

39:39.410 --> 39:40.076
Nothing happened.

39:40.078 --> 39:41.678
Just try again.

39:42.747 --> 39:46.516
No, it worked.

39:50.588 --> 39:51.521
It gets easier every time.

39:51.523 --> 39:52.956
It feels good almost.

39:56.460 --> 39:57.660
Shit.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.997
Maybe that's what
happened to Devin.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.732
He was using his power
without even realizing it

40:02.734 --> 40:04.934
and blew himself up.

40:04.936 --> 40:07.604
Maybe Jenna didn't understand
her own strength and...

40:07.606 --> 40:09.472
Oh, I don't want anything.

40:09.474 --> 40:11.574
Seriously, what
is your problem?

40:11.576 --> 40:13.643
You have a chance of
being a superhero.

40:13.645 --> 40:15.879
And you're just staring there
like a whiny little bitch.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.046
Settle down, Giggles.

40:17.048 --> 40:18.681
No, I'm sick of
this fucking whinging.

40:18.683 --> 40:21.418
We maybe stuck in here
but we're one pair away

40:21.420 --> 40:23.486
from being so fucking brilliant.

40:23.488 --> 40:27.457
And all I ever hear from
you is "wa, wa, wa, wa, wa."

40:27.459 --> 40:29.125
Leave me alone.

40:36.700 --> 40:37.967
Beautiful.

40:39.570 --> 40:40.503
I felt it.

40:40.505 --> 40:42.105
So I just made it happen.

40:43.774 --> 40:45.175
You're another teleporter.

40:45.177 --> 40:47.177
No, I don't think so.

40:47.179 --> 40:48.144
I don't know.

40:48.146 --> 40:49.712
But I'm pretty sure I can...

40:51.882 --> 40:53.049
Yeah.

40:54.018 --> 40:56.052
I think I can
travel back in time.

41:00.158 --> 41:01.991
Can you say that again?

41:01.993 --> 41:04.527
You can travel back in time?

41:04.529 --> 41:07.030
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

41:07.032 --> 41:08.631
Pretty cool, hey.

41:08.633 --> 41:09.532
I can go back.

41:09.534 --> 41:10.834
Do things different.

41:10.836 --> 41:12.936
Friends, school, I'd go
back to Forest Greg Camp

41:12.938 --> 41:16.105
I won't be "pee
pee Lilly" anymore.

41:16.107 --> 41:17.807
What the fuck?

41:17.809 --> 41:19.709
You can go back in time

41:19.711 --> 41:21.544
and not a word of thanks?

41:21.546 --> 41:23.746
I got that power out of you.

41:23.748 --> 41:26.149
You're like Back to the Future.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.017
That's a good power.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.819
You could learn a lot
from her, Colorgirl.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.221
Don't call me that.

41:31.223 --> 41:34.958
You know that's gonna be your
shitty superhero name, yeah?

41:34.960 --> 41:37.627
Lilly, can you do it again?

41:37.629 --> 41:40.096
I mean I guess if I
could I already would've.

41:40.098 --> 41:41.164
Hi.

41:43.701 --> 41:45.201
Well, I guess I did.

41:46.570 --> 41:47.871
So cool.

41:47.873 --> 41:49.839
I've been so into time
travel my whole life.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.108
And now I can actually do it.

41:52.110 --> 41:56.112
Listen, the pill is asking
us to make changes, right?

41:56.114 --> 41:59.549
It's given us all the
Time, gas, movement.

41:59.551 --> 42:03.286
And if you can control it,
you could fix the world.

42:03.288 --> 42:08.825
With any ideas about what's
going on in this fucking room.

42:08.827 --> 42:11.027
I mean the second time it
happened it felt amazing.

42:11.029 --> 42:14.097
It was like I could choose
exactly when I went and where.

42:14.099 --> 42:15.632
You can control it already?

42:15.634 --> 42:16.666
Where do I go?

42:16.668 --> 42:19.636
Oi, go back before
the World Cup.

42:19.638 --> 42:20.603
I know all the results.

42:20.605 --> 42:22.138
We'll make a fucking million!

42:22.140 --> 42:25.842
Wouldn't you still
be stuck in here?

42:25.844 --> 42:28.878
I haven't thought the whole
plan for it yet, John.

42:28.880 --> 42:29.679
Have I?

42:29.681 --> 42:30.647
Of course.

42:30.649 --> 42:32.048
Lilly, you could go back in time

42:32.050 --> 42:34.784
and you could tell us
not to do the experiment.

42:34.786 --> 42:38.054
I mean, that way Jenna and
Devin would still be alive.

42:38.056 --> 42:40.757
I don't think you understand
how time travel works.

42:40.759 --> 42:42.225
Like I might be able
to visit the past

42:42.227 --> 42:43.993
but that doesn't mean I
can manipulate the future.

42:43.995 --> 42:46.863
I'd be playing with an
infinite number of variables.

42:46.865 --> 42:49.265
How do you know all this?

42:49.267 --> 42:50.967
This is just the stuff I know.

42:50.969 --> 42:53.803
On the weekends, you
drink and have fun.

42:53.805 --> 42:55.004
This is what I do.

42:55.006 --> 42:56.606
You should not play
with time, Lilly.

42:56.608 --> 42:59.309
You can only seek salvation
by moving forward.

42:59.311 --> 43:01.311
Don't do it, my little sister.

43:01.313 --> 43:03.680
Maybe I could even go
back to before I was born.

43:03.682 --> 43:05.615
Like I could look at
a picture of Einstein

43:05.617 --> 43:07.584
and go back to the moment
it was taken and meet him.

43:07.586 --> 43:08.685
He'd be so blown away.

43:08.687 --> 43:09.919
Wait.

43:12.123 --> 43:14.591
And I tell him all about
the theory of relatively,

43:14.593 --> 43:16.793
and then he just tells
people he came up with it.

43:16.795 --> 43:18.227
Maybe I'm Einstein.

43:18.229 --> 43:19.329
Fuck!

43:19.331 --> 43:23.933
Tell me to come steal the
pill but not go in the room.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.301
What?

43:25.303 --> 43:27.103
I just want an
ability, all right?

43:27.105 --> 43:28.638
This pill is sexist.

43:28.640 --> 43:30.139
I mean superheroes are
supposed to be men.

43:30.141 --> 43:33.009
You have no idea of the
effects you could have

43:33.011 --> 43:34.310
outside of this room.

43:34.312 --> 43:37.847
But we won't see the
other side of this room.

43:37.849 --> 43:40.149
I just don't
think it will work.

43:40.151 --> 43:42.251
There are three common
types of time travel:

43:42.253 --> 43:44.354
Fixed, multiverse, and dynamic.

43:44.356 --> 43:46.723
I just strongly believe
in a fixed timeline.

43:46.725 --> 43:47.657
Sorry.

43:47.659 --> 43:48.358
Can you explain all this?

43:48.360 --> 43:49.993
Okay.

43:49.995 --> 43:56.032
Just say time travel works
on a fixed timeline basis.

43:56.233 --> 43:58.935
That means that time
operates as a static line.

43:58.937 --> 44:02.672
When I go back, we can
deviate from this line.

44:02.674 --> 44:04.140
In fact, it goes so far
as to say that any change

44:04.142 --> 44:06.075
I could make has
already happened.

44:06.077 --> 44:08.011
So if it's a fixed timeline,
I could already gone back

44:08.013 --> 44:09.679
hundreds of times
and tried to save us.

44:09.681 --> 44:12.348
We're also standing
here right now.

44:12.350 --> 44:15.318
With Novikov's
self-consistency principle.

44:16.854 --> 44:17.854
I couldn't agree more.

44:17.856 --> 44:18.955
Fuck!

44:18.957 --> 44:21.090
Ow! Stop doing that.

44:21.092 --> 44:21.924
Oh my God.

44:21.926 --> 44:24.160
So I guess you can
all see me again.

44:24.162 --> 44:28.965
Okay, just say my dad
is killed in a robbery.

44:28.967 --> 44:30.867
I go back in time to
when the thief is a baby

44:30.869 --> 44:32.869
and kill him to save my dad.

44:32.871 --> 44:34.071
Where did he come from?

44:34.072 --> 44:35.672
To the future,
my dad is still dead,

44:35.674 --> 44:36.873
still killed in
the same robbery.

44:36.875 --> 44:39.242
Lilly, a guy just
appeared in the room.

44:39.244 --> 44:40.677
Don't you get it?

44:40.679 --> 44:42.245
After I kill the
thief, his parents

44:42.247 --> 44:44.414
adopt another kid
to fill the boy.

44:44.416 --> 44:46.149
A kid who grows
up, all messed up,

44:46.151 --> 44:48.351
becomes a thief
and kills my dad.

44:48.353 --> 44:50.253
What the fuck is going on here?

44:50.255 --> 44:52.088
Nothing can change
once it's happened.

44:52.090 --> 44:54.957
If it's a fixed timeline
then we're stuck here.

44:54.959 --> 44:58.027
I mean, how do you change
what's already happened?

44:58.029 --> 44:59.929
Who the fuck are you?

44:59.931 --> 45:01.264
Seriously?

45:01.266 --> 45:03.099
None of you this time?

45:03.101 --> 45:06.302
Phil Gaylord, out
of work sales rep.

45:06.304 --> 45:07.437
Is that your real name?

45:07.439 --> 45:08.805
Am I the lord of the gays?

45:08.807 --> 45:11.774
You've said that
thing countless times.

45:11.776 --> 45:12.341
No, I haven't.

45:12.343 --> 45:13.910
Yes, you have.

45:13.912 --> 45:15.945
You all know me.

45:15.947 --> 45:18.981
Every time I come back you all
seem to know a little less.

45:18.983 --> 45:21.184
Nikki, I just hoped you
clean up after Jenna.

45:22.319 --> 45:23.953
We talked about going home.

45:23.955 --> 45:25.054
There's no way.

45:25.056 --> 45:26.456
I've never seen you before.

45:28.125 --> 45:29.459
Come on.

45:29.461 --> 45:30.860
You know me, Nikki.

45:30.862 --> 45:32.942
You've known me for
most of your life.

45:33.864 --> 45:35.031
We grew up together.

45:35.033 --> 45:36.065
I used to walk you home.

45:36.067 --> 45:36.999
I don't know what to say.

45:37.001 --> 45:38.901
I have no idea who you are.

45:38.903 --> 45:40.737
I've been doing this
stupid test for you,

45:40.739 --> 45:42.505
so you can't run
away on me again.

45:42.507 --> 45:43.840
Excuse me?

45:43.842 --> 45:45.274
You're dating this guy?

45:45.276 --> 45:46.209
No.

45:46.211 --> 45:47.143
I'm gonna save you, Nikki.

45:47.145 --> 45:48.077
Don't you worry.

45:48.079 --> 45:48.978
I'm getting us out of here.

45:48.980 --> 45:50.213
You'll come home with me.

45:50.215 --> 45:51.848
I'll take care of you.

45:51.850 --> 45:52.782
What is wrong with you?

45:52.784 --> 45:54.250
You know nothing about me.

45:54.252 --> 45:56.018
I know everything about you.

45:57.287 --> 45:58.988
I know why you ran away.

45:58.990 --> 46:00.923
- I know about the accident.
- Shut up!

46:00.925 --> 46:02.859
It wasn't your fault.

46:02.861 --> 46:04.093
You didn't even say goodbye.

46:04.095 --> 46:07.463
Me and your father have been
looking for you for two years.

46:07.465 --> 46:08.464
And I'm getting you
out of this room

46:08.466 --> 46:10.366
and I'm taking you home.

46:10.368 --> 46:12.135
How could you know that?

46:12.137 --> 46:13.369
This ability.

46:13.371 --> 46:15.438
It's getting so powerful.

46:15.440 --> 46:18.775
So you're in here
from the very start?

46:18.777 --> 46:20.076
I took the pill
the same time as you,

46:20.078 --> 46:22.111
it just worked on
me immediately.

46:22.113 --> 46:24.814
What is your
superpower exactly?

46:24.816 --> 46:27.316
I turn invisible, obviously.

46:27.318 --> 46:29.218
At first, I thought you
guys were just ignoring me.

46:29.220 --> 46:30.553
Then I started screaming at you.

46:30.555 --> 46:31.921
I even tried touching you.

46:31.923 --> 46:34.023
I thought you're
feeling the pill.

46:34.025 --> 46:34.991
Yes, yes.

46:34.993 --> 46:37.126
You touched us?

46:37.128 --> 46:38.328
So where did you touch us?

46:38.329 --> 46:39.262
It doesn't matter.

46:39.264 --> 46:41.097
Anyway, I lost control of it.

46:41.099 --> 46:43.399
I kept popping in and out.

46:43.401 --> 46:45.134
I got so powerful so quick.

46:45.136 --> 46:46.135
Before I knew it, I was starting

46:46.137 --> 46:48.437
to be erased from your minds.

46:48.439 --> 46:49.505
Guys, listen!

46:49.507 --> 46:52.575
It could be a multiverse.

46:52.577 --> 46:55.011
That means that every
time I travel back

46:55.013 --> 46:56.512
I create a new reality.

46:56.514 --> 46:58.414
In those realities
we might be safe.

46:58.416 --> 46:59.549
But in this one here and now,

46:59.551 --> 47:00.550
we're still stuck in the room.

47:00.552 --> 47:03.586
No, I've already travelled and
seen myself in this reality.

47:03.588 --> 47:04.554
So it can't be.

47:04.556 --> 47:06.122
It's gotta be fixed or dynamic.

47:07.124 --> 47:09.292
You're not at all
interested in this idiot.

47:09.294 --> 47:10.293
Hey.

47:10.295 --> 47:12.028
Sorry, I'm just a bit jealous.

47:12.030 --> 47:13.830
And I'd say with your powers.

47:13.832 --> 47:19.035
What if I use it again and
I'm erased from existence,

47:19.037 --> 47:23.940
Wait a second, have you guys
not noticed jumps in time?

47:23.942 --> 47:26.275
I mean you forget every
conversation you have with me.

47:26.277 --> 47:28.010
You basically skipped
that moment in history

47:28.012 --> 47:29.011
like it never happened.

47:29.013 --> 47:31.380
That explains why it
feels we've only been here

47:31.382 --> 47:32.415
for such a short time.

47:32.417 --> 47:34.083
I remember you.

47:35.619 --> 47:37.854
Do you think maybe you might
wanna have mentioned that?

47:37.856 --> 47:40.556
You need to discover
your own path, brother.

47:40.558 --> 47:42.325
Besides, I didn't know
if you were coming back.

47:42.327 --> 47:44.407
So it didn't seem worth
scaring the group.

47:45.430 --> 47:49.031
If you're invisible, just
walk through the door.

47:49.033 --> 47:50.399
That's not what
invisible means.

47:50.401 --> 47:51.934
I've told you this.

47:51.936 --> 47:53.536
I'm still stuck in
here just like you.

47:53.538 --> 47:55.371
Nobody can see me.

47:55.373 --> 47:57.173
Maybe your powers
a bit shit then.

47:57.175 --> 47:59.141
Yeah, that would be right.

47:59.143 --> 48:01.310
Guys, stop worrying
about Mr. Invisible.

48:01.312 --> 48:03.880
I might be able to
get us out of here.

48:03.882 --> 48:05.248
Jesus.

48:05.250 --> 48:07.149
There's one more option.

48:07.151 --> 48:08.251
It's the most dangerous

48:08.253 --> 48:10.353
and it's also the most unlikely.

48:10.355 --> 48:12.021
So I really punched you, yeah?

48:12.023 --> 48:13.956
You told me it's
a prison reflex.

48:13.958 --> 48:14.924
Yeah, it is.

48:14.926 --> 48:16.192
From bum raping you.

48:16.194 --> 48:17.426
Guys, shut up.

48:17.428 --> 48:18.461
Listen to Lilly.

48:18.463 --> 48:23.165
Do you have any idea what
it's like to disappear?

48:29.172 --> 48:30.306
Dynamic.

48:30.308 --> 48:33.109
This is where shit gets crazy.

48:33.111 --> 48:35.077
It poses that if I go back

48:35.079 --> 48:36.979
I can impact this moment.

48:36.981 --> 48:39.582
I tell us not to go into
the room and we don't.

48:41.084 --> 48:41.651
Fucking awesome.

48:41.653 --> 48:45.354
But if I do that, I
could create a paradox.

48:45.356 --> 48:47.657
And I kinda might wreck
the whole universe.

48:47.659 --> 48:49.425
What will the paradox be?

48:49.427 --> 48:51.260
Okay, well, if
I go back in time

48:51.262 --> 48:53.663
and tell myself not
to take the pill,

48:53.665 --> 48:54.997
then I don't take the pill

48:54.999 --> 48:57.600
and tell myself
not take the pill.

48:57.602 --> 48:59.635
And what if the new me
doesn't push out the old me

48:59.637 --> 49:01.304
and I just keep creating
duplicates of myself.

49:01.306 --> 49:04.273
I mean guys this is heavy.

49:04.275 --> 49:06.676
No, just don't stuff
up, what's her name?

49:06.678 --> 49:08.110
Her name was Jenna.

49:08.112 --> 49:10.479
What if I create
an infinity loop

49:10.481 --> 49:13.149
and taking the pill
and keep going back

49:13.151 --> 49:14.317
and taking the pill
and keep going back

49:14.319 --> 49:15.318
and taking the pill.

49:15.320 --> 49:16.152
I can't do it.

49:16.154 --> 49:17.420
No, I can't do it.

49:17.422 --> 49:18.220
We can't.

49:18.222 --> 49:21.490
Lilly, you have a
chance to save us.

49:21.492 --> 49:22.725
You've gotta try.

49:22.727 --> 49:23.927
You can do this, Lilly.

49:27.698 --> 49:29.398
What the fuck?

49:36.006 --> 49:39.241
Lilly, you might be our only
hope of getting out of here.

49:40.711 --> 49:42.831
I know it's not fair
to put that on you.

49:45.716 --> 49:49.018
I'm just scared, okay?

49:50.755 --> 49:55.358
I will have done
nothing with my life.

49:55.360 --> 49:57.259
There's so much.

50:02.066 --> 50:05.701
I did this test so I'd have
money to go to Comic-Con.

50:07.004 --> 50:09.638
I just wanted to hangout
with people like me.

50:10.607 --> 50:11.440
What?

50:11.442 --> 50:13.142
Other little weirdoes?

50:13.144 --> 50:17.013
Shut the fuck up.

50:17.514 --> 50:22.585
You misogynistic, homophobic,
self-centered asshole.

50:23.153 --> 50:25.321
Nobody cares what you think.

50:25.323 --> 50:28.457
You stupid, dumb, fucking loser.

50:30.627 --> 50:31.761
All right.

50:33.030 --> 50:34.463
Okay, I'll do it.

50:37.367 --> 50:39.301
I'll see you on the
other side of that door,

50:39.303 --> 50:42.238
otherwise if any of
you get the same power

50:42.240 --> 50:43.706
say hi to Einstein for me.

50:45.075 --> 50:46.342
You can do this.

50:47.310 --> 50:48.411
I know.

51:10.400 --> 51:11.534
Guys?

51:13.837 --> 51:15.304
Guys?

51:18.508 --> 51:19.608
Guys.

51:29.753 --> 51:30.619
Guys?

51:31.555 --> 51:32.621
Are you still here?

51:47.537 --> 51:48.637
Stop.

51:51.842 --> 51:53.109
No.

51:57.447 --> 51:58.681
Oh my God.

52:04.588 --> 52:05.855
How did I get here?

52:05.857 --> 52:07.189
Stop!

52:07.191 --> 52:07.756
Who are you guys?
What the hell?

52:07.758 --> 52:09.225
Stop!

52:09.227 --> 52:09.892
Where am I?

52:09.894 --> 52:10.693
Help!

52:10.695 --> 52:12.795
Guys, we're creating
an infinite loop.

52:12.797 --> 52:14.163
You need to stop.

52:14.165 --> 52:15.297
What's going on?

52:20.804 --> 52:22.671
Stop!

52:32.382 --> 52:33.649
I fucking knew it.

52:34.618 --> 52:35.818
Fuck!

52:36.720 --> 52:37.853
Fuck!

52:39.623 --> 52:40.856
What does it mean?

52:46.329 --> 52:47.496
I don't know.

53:03.680 --> 53:05.314
It can't end like this.

53:16.359 --> 53:18.327
Maybe your power will
be to break through doors

53:18.329 --> 53:19.929
and get us out of here, huh?

53:21.698 --> 53:23.199
What happened?

53:24.401 --> 53:25.935
Old baseball injury.

53:28.338 --> 53:30.606
You lie more naturally
than you tell the truth.

53:34.678 --> 53:35.678
Oh God.

53:37.914 --> 53:40.282
Guys, I owe money to

53:40.284 --> 53:42.718
are very serious about
me paying them back.

53:43.954 --> 53:45.354
And if you can't?

53:51.294 --> 53:52.962
Let's just worry
about one thing

53:52.964 --> 53:55.264
possibly causing
my death at a time.

54:02.639 --> 54:03.906
Are you okay?

54:05.876 --> 54:06.976
It's just the power.

54:06.978 --> 54:08.510
I don't feel so good.

54:10.313 --> 54:12.314
I just need a minute
to clear my head.

54:12.316 --> 54:13.449
Yeah.

54:37.841 --> 54:39.275
Okay.

54:39.277 --> 54:41.543
I have always loved you.

54:43.880 --> 54:45.281
Who the fuck!

54:45.283 --> 54:46.348
What happened?

54:46.350 --> 54:47.750
You okay?

54:48.718 --> 54:50.286
John?

54:50.288 --> 54:51.453
What?

54:54.658 --> 54:56.058
What is it?

54:57.294 --> 54:58.594
Do your insides feel weird?

54:58.596 --> 54:59.695
Did you find your power?

54:59.697 --> 55:00.696
I don't know.

55:01.632 --> 55:02.832
I think I'm losing my mind.

55:13.410 --> 55:15.377
Are you serious?

55:15.379 --> 55:18.647
But I'm gonna be ready
and looking good.

55:18.649 --> 55:19.748
What is it?

55:21.051 --> 55:23.619
Looks like our friend over here

55:23.621 --> 55:25.788
sees himself as a
bit of a superhero.

55:26.623 --> 55:28.924
It's not finished, is it?

55:28.926 --> 55:32.928
Do I like it's my idea
to make fun of me, does it?

55:32.930 --> 55:33.996
Okay.

55:33.998 --> 55:35.064
Okay.

55:35.066 --> 55:36.398
Here.

55:39.403 --> 55:40.436
The Giggler.

55:40.438 --> 55:42.338
What did I just say?

55:43.440 --> 55:44.506
Stop!

55:44.508 --> 55:45.607
Stop it!

55:46.676 --> 55:48.410
Stop it you fucking idiots.

55:52.749 --> 55:53.982
Fuck me.

55:54.951 --> 55:56.352
How about that?

56:00.123 --> 56:01.824
I just got my ability.

56:04.027 --> 56:05.427
What is it?

56:09.799 --> 56:11.800
I don't have to breathe.

56:11.802 --> 56:13.469
You don't need to breathe?

56:14.504 --> 56:16.004
Hold your breath.

56:32.055 --> 56:33.822
Well?

56:33.824 --> 56:35.924
I think he's right.

56:35.926 --> 56:37.726
Wait a minute.

56:37.728 --> 56:39.428
I don't have to breathe.

56:40.430 --> 56:41.063
Fuck me!

56:41.065 --> 56:41.997
I'm like Aquaman.

56:41.999 --> 56:43.432
Who?

56:43.434 --> 56:44.833
Aquaman.

56:44.835 --> 56:48.070
We used to have these
comics in prison.

56:48.072 --> 56:50.005
I fucking hated him.

56:50.007 --> 56:52.474
He's a superhero that
can swim with the fishes.

56:52.476 --> 56:55.144
He's basically the most
boring superhero ever.

56:55.146 --> 56:57.226
Still gonna call
yourself The Giggler?

57:00.016 --> 57:01.483
I can't even swim.

57:02.419 --> 57:05.087
I'm like a shitter
than shit Aquaman.

57:05.089 --> 57:07.990
You probably can't even
communicate with fish.

57:07.992 --> 57:11.160
So you're like shitter
than a shit shit Aquaman.

57:11.162 --> 57:13.095
Oh, you suddenly got a
sense of humor, have you?

57:13.097 --> 57:15.831
Hey, I'd love to
communicate with the fishes.

57:15.833 --> 57:18.600
I think Aquaman's an
amazing superhero.

57:18.602 --> 57:20.002
Why are you here, Corey?

57:20.004 --> 57:21.603
Why would you take
a pill for science

57:21.605 --> 57:23.539
when you're into energy
and all that shit?

57:23.541 --> 57:25.040
Why are you fucking here, Corey?

57:25.042 --> 57:27.042
Hey, just relax.

57:27.044 --> 57:27.943
Take a deep breath.

57:27.945 --> 57:30.546
Oh wait, you can't.

57:32.149 --> 57:33.582
It's not funny.

57:33.584 --> 57:35.184
Yes, it is.

57:35.186 --> 57:36.585
I want a better power.

57:37.620 --> 57:39.521
I want a better power.

57:39.523 --> 57:42.124
I want a better fucking power.

57:42.959 --> 57:45.461
The universe works
in mysterious ways.

57:46.062 --> 57:47.563
There is no chance.

57:47.565 --> 57:48.931
It's just an
infinite story, lad,

57:48.933 --> 57:51.667
where you're gonna get
what you deserve to get.

57:51.669 --> 57:53.168
Guys, the clock.

57:53.170 --> 57:54.169
We're gonna get out of here.

57:54.171 --> 57:55.871
Eight hours already.

57:56.840 --> 58:00.476
We're here until the
universe wants us to be here.

58:01.244 --> 58:03.679
Seriously, suck a
bag of dicks, Corey.

58:08.685 --> 58:10.752
Watch out world, The
Giggler is coming.

58:12.989 --> 58:14.556
Well, chose a name then.

58:38.715 --> 58:40.182
Fucking hell!

58:41.251 --> 58:43.719
Get me out of this fucking hell!

58:46.991 --> 58:49.958
I knew that door wouldn't
open until those geeks

58:49.960 --> 58:52.561
saw exactly what
we're capable of.

58:53.196 --> 58:55.230
By my count, I think
we've got two powers

58:55.232 --> 58:57.099
we haven't seen yet.

58:57.101 --> 59:00.602
You and that fucking freak.

59:00.604 --> 59:02.137
If you would do a drug test,

59:02.139 --> 59:04.072
you don't open that
door until you see

59:04.074 --> 59:06.275
exactly what that pill does.

59:06.277 --> 59:09.645
That's how we get out
of here, isn't it?

59:09.647 --> 59:10.812
Giggles, you're scaring me.

59:10.814 --> 59:13.615
You think I give
a fuck about you?

59:13.617 --> 59:15.217
I have killed people
for looking at me

59:15.219 --> 59:17.152
the wrong fucking way.

59:17.154 --> 59:20.622
That door doesn't open until
we show them our powers.

59:20.624 --> 59:24.660
So let's show them our
powers right fucking now!

59:24.662 --> 59:25.627
Giggles, stop.

59:25.629 --> 59:26.828
Yeah, why don't you relax?

59:26.830 --> 59:28.897
All those stress is
making you unpleasant.

59:28.899 --> 59:30.966
I'm fucking done with you.

59:30.968 --> 59:32.834
I've been watching him.

59:32.836 --> 59:36.171
He just looks and
spies all day long.

59:36.173 --> 59:38.040
No, I've been meditating.

59:38.042 --> 59:38.907
No, you haven't.

59:38.909 --> 59:40.909
You've been practicing.

59:40.911 --> 59:42.678
No, I'm meditate everyday.

59:42.680 --> 59:44.346
Just like any
other day I'm here.

59:44.348 --> 59:46.315
Show me your fucking power.

59:53.222 --> 59:54.723
I don't feel so good.

59:54.725 --> 59:55.824
What are you doing?

59:55.826 --> 59:56.992
This is amazing.

59:56.994 --> 59:57.793
Giggles.

59:57.795 --> 59:59.127
It gets better.

59:59.129 --> 01:00:00.862
What are you doing?

01:00:00.864 --> 01:00:01.897
Giggles, stop it.

01:00:01.899 --> 01:00:03.231
It gets more powerful.

01:00:03.233 --> 01:00:04.933
Stop right now!

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:07.102
Giggles, what are you doing?

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:08.270
Stop it!

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:10.639
Tell me your power.

01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:11.907
I wouldn't do that.

01:00:11.909 --> 01:00:13.942
Tell me your fucking power.

01:00:16.212 --> 01:00:19.081
Tell me your powers you
little fucking shit.

01:00:21.652 --> 01:00:22.784
Stop it!

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.821
Are you doing this?

01:00:25.823 --> 01:00:27.789
Are you playing with the lights?

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:30.826
It's so powerful.

01:00:30.828 --> 01:00:31.627
Stop, Giggles.

01:00:31.629 --> 01:00:32.828
You're killing him.

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:35.097
It gets more
powerful each time.

01:00:35.099 --> 01:00:36.965
I can control the air.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:38.767
Can you feel that, Corey?

01:00:38.769 --> 01:00:39.868
Giggles.

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:41.103
Can you feel this, Corey?

01:00:41.105 --> 01:00:44.106
Can you feel all the air
just leaving your lung?

01:00:44.108 --> 01:00:45.874
Tell me your fucking power.

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:47.076
Listen to me, Giggles, please.

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:48.176
Stop it!

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:54.916
Fucking idiot.

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:03.258
I'm so powerful.

01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:06.662
It's fucking amazing.

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:10.666
Do you know why they
call me Giggles, John?

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:13.402
Because no matter what sick
shit they gave me in prison,

01:01:13.404 --> 01:01:16.438
I just smiled and
laughed at them.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.006
Do you understand?

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:19.941
You can't fuck with me.

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:26.248
Is this turning you on?

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:30.185
Is this turning you on?

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:33.989
Let me show you what
this pill can do.

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:37.392
I'm the superhero in this room.

01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:42.297
I win.

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:05.253
You found your power.

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:09.324
I don't understand.

01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:23.739
Are you okay?

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:31.747
No.

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:34.950
He's gone.

01:02:34.952 --> 01:02:36.184
Trust me.

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:38.420
That was you.

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.924
What's your power?

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:44.292
I can change things.

01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:47.529
All things.

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:52.300
I got it seconds
after taking the pill.

01:02:53.336 --> 01:02:55.137
You see, I felt
something immediately

01:02:55.139 --> 01:02:58.540
because I live a pure lifestyle.

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:01.810
Why didn't you tell us?

01:03:01.812 --> 01:03:04.780
Because I needed to discover
what was inside of me.

01:03:04.782 --> 01:03:08.950
I mean, I wish you could
see what I see, brother.

01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:09.918
Feel what I feel.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.453
I have become a God.

01:03:11.455 --> 01:03:13.488
And I will be good.

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:15.423
I will be so good.

01:03:16.826 --> 01:03:18.260
You've been using your
powers from the beginning.

01:03:18.262 --> 01:03:19.861
It's too dangerous.

01:03:19.863 --> 01:03:22.230
You see, that's
where you're wrong.

01:03:22.232 --> 01:03:24.866
I was eating an apple
when I first felt it

01:03:24.868 --> 01:03:28.436
and then suddenly I
was eating a banana.

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:37.345
You see, the thing is
I can change matter.

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:42.551
It starts small
but then it gets,

01:03:42.553 --> 01:03:44.853
I mean it gets wow.

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:51.560
And now, I mean now I've
gone so far beyond matter.

01:03:51.562 --> 01:03:53.862
I understand the
language of nature.

01:03:53.864 --> 01:03:56.598
I see the code that makes
up the entire universe.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.867
It's so beautiful.

01:03:58.869 --> 01:04:01.036
It's great that
you can see the code.

01:04:01.038 --> 01:04:06.107
Can we please just get
out of this fucking room?

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:07.909
No.

01:04:07.911 --> 01:04:10.412
No, that's simply not an option.

01:04:10.414 --> 01:04:11.446
I mean that's too dangerous.

01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:13.515
That's why I moved the room.

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:14.516
You what?

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:18.620
I moved the room.

01:04:18.622 --> 01:04:20.055
After Devin exploded,

01:04:20.057 --> 01:04:22.137
I had to make sure that
no one could leave.

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:25.460
Can you imagine if
a man like Giggles

01:04:25.462 --> 01:04:27.329
was allowed outside this room?

01:04:27.331 --> 01:04:28.597
The damage he would do?

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:33.068
Don't you get it?

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:35.937
I made the door
impossible to open.

01:04:35.939 --> 01:04:38.073
I surrounded us by brick.

01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:39.975
I moved us to a safe location

01:04:39.977 --> 01:04:42.277
and I left an empty
room in its place.

01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:48.083
To see the look on those
stupid scientists' faces

01:04:48.085 --> 01:04:50.252
when they walked
into an empty room.

01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:56.057
Oh, and Lilly, I guess
that must have been

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:57.626
a little bit confusing for her.

01:04:58.461 --> 01:05:00.195
Oops!

01:05:00.197 --> 01:05:01.196
Where the fuck are we?

01:05:01.198 --> 01:05:02.898
And who was trying to get in?

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:06.968
About that, I wanna be
completely honest with you.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:08.303
You see, when I moved
the room at first,

01:05:08.305 --> 01:05:10.105
I was still working
on my powers.

01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:12.007
That might have been a pack
of wild animals or something.

01:05:12.009 --> 01:05:13.108
Either way, it's okay.

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:14.042
I moved us again.

01:05:14.044 --> 01:05:15.377
We're all good now.

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:16.912
I just wanna go home.

01:05:18.147 --> 01:05:19.514
I know you do.

01:05:20.383 --> 01:05:23.618
I know but I feel I
should explain something.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.954
You see these underground trials

01:05:25.956 --> 01:05:28.189
they have been
going on for years.

01:05:28.191 --> 01:05:31.059
I mean they do these secret
tests on desperate people

01:05:31.061 --> 01:05:34.162
like you guys and they
trial these goddamn drugs

01:05:34.164 --> 01:05:36.564
and they don't care
how dangerous they are.

01:05:36.566 --> 01:05:38.199
See, I've been trying to
get one of these for months.

01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:39.567
Blow the lid off
the whole thing.

01:05:39.569 --> 01:05:41.703
Show the world that
everything we need

01:05:41.705 --> 01:05:44.272
we get from nature.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:47.375
It's a sign from the universe
that I was put in this test

01:05:47.377 --> 01:05:48.677
that I took that pill.

01:05:48.679 --> 01:05:50.545
I am worthy of this mission

01:05:50.547 --> 01:05:52.113
and I accept.

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:54.482
You're worthy?

01:05:56.018 --> 01:05:57.218
You were chosen.

01:05:58.354 --> 01:05:59.587
John...

01:06:03.192 --> 01:06:04.659
we were chosen.

01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:08.964
And everyone failed.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.267
Except me.

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:17.372
Could you open
the door, please?

01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:22.644
Please, I'm begging you.

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:27.682
No.

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:33.288
No, you see being a god means

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:36.124
making some hard decision.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:41.629
You see, I sat just over there

01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:45.266
and I watched
everything everyone did.

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:48.737
And none of you all
have the ability

01:06:48.739 --> 01:06:52.207
to control or the purity I do.

01:06:52.209 --> 01:06:53.475
So I can't risk it.

01:06:53.477 --> 01:06:55.777
And the universe
certainly can't risk it.

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:02.784
I'm sorry.

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:09.057
I really am.

01:07:16.265 --> 01:07:18.366
What the fuck was that?

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:21.069
Who was that?

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:24.139
That was Phil.

01:07:26.108 --> 01:07:28.043
He was never gonna be special.

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:30.178
You killed him?

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:34.449
Don't see it as death.

01:07:34.451 --> 01:07:38.086
Please, I'm so beyond that now.

01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:43.158
I wish you could come with me.

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:45.727
I really do.

01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:50.698
I promise I'm gonna turn you
into something beautiful.

01:07:53.135 --> 01:07:54.402
Beautiful.

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:02.544
But you, John...

01:08:05.314 --> 01:08:07.082
You're the worst of them all.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.113
I had to.

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:41.448
It's just us now.

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:45.319
Thank you.

01:08:46.421 --> 01:08:49.624
You saved me and I
don't deserve it.

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:53.394
Of course you do.

01:08:54.395 --> 01:08:55.662
You're good, John.

01:08:56.599 --> 01:08:57.665
No.

01:08:58.834 --> 01:09:00.301
It's not true.

01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:05.406
I really needed this money.

01:09:06.575 --> 01:09:10.678
And I heard a guy
talking about the trials

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.147
so I...

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:15.716
So what did you do?

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:18.685
I knocked him out.

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:21.221
Stole his identity.

01:09:24.859 --> 01:09:26.461
Your name isn't John, is it?

01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:31.566
How many lies have you told me?

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:35.703
Just one more.

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:42.676
What's wrong?

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:47.849
It doesn't feel right.

01:09:51.252 --> 01:09:52.886
It's too much it hurts.

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:55.523
What's happening?

01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:02.363
It doesn't hurt anymore.

01:10:07.636 --> 01:10:09.996
I guess I really wasn't
meant to be a superhero.

01:10:11.273 --> 01:10:12.307
No.

01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:14.909
Nikki, no.

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:17.585
