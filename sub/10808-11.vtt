NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:11.138 --> 01:13.440
(dog barks in distance)

01:13.440 --> 01:14.808
Hello. Hello, babies.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.310
Mama's home.

01:16.310 --> 01:20.381
I know, I know you're hungry,
snookums.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.816
We're all hungry.

01:22.816 --> 01:25.953
It's snack time.

01:25.953 --> 01:28.722
-MALE VOICE: Hey, fattie,
you warthog. -Mmm... (laughs)

01:28.722 --> 01:30.691
Pick up some whipped cream

01:30.691 --> 01:32.960
to slather all over
your buttocks

01:32.960 --> 01:35.396
and squish between
your fat toes?

01:35.396 --> 01:38.065
You want to look like
a walking cream puff?

01:38.065 --> 01:40.367
A walking, talking lard bucket

01:40.367 --> 01:42.903
oozing down the street, Fobsie?

01:42.903 --> 01:44.632

01:55.716 --> 01:57.946
(screaming continues)

02:01.889 --> 02:03.490
(TV clicks off)

02:03.490 --> 02:08.462
Okay, snookums, it's food time.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.953
Open your pores.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.568
Open wide!

02:14.568 --> 02:17.538
Num, num, num, num, num, num!

02:17.538 --> 02:21.608
All my little babies, yeah!

02:21.608 --> 02:24.478
Don't you want
to talk to Mommy?

02:24.478 --> 02:27.538
You're my little buddies,
yes, you are.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.547

03:24.505 --> 03:27.374

03:27.374 --> 03:29.308
No one ever calls me.

03:36.917 --> 03:37.975
Hello?

03:39.286 --> 03:41.021
Hello?

03:41.021 --> 03:42.222
MAN:

03:42.222 --> 03:43.991

03:52.866 --> 03:54.501

03:57.070 --> 03:58.071

04:25.399 --> 04:28.168
I didn't order anything.

04:28.168 --> 04:30.261
Oh, it's okay.
"Your weight is over."

04:34.808 --> 04:36.571
(dog barking in distance)

04:41.648 --> 04:43.445
Wonder what it is.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.730

05:44.244 --> 05:47.214
ELMO:
Betsy, it's Elmo Shroud.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.749
Elmo?

05:48.749 --> 05:51.652
Elmo Shroud from
good ol' Oswego High.

05:51.652 --> 05:55.188
The last time I saw you
was, uh, prom night.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.891
Elmo.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.993
Um, yeah, l-l'm in town
on business,

05:59.993 --> 06:02.963
and I thought it might be fun
to get together.

06:02.963 --> 06:06.566
You know, talk about
the good ol' days.

06:06.566 --> 06:10.404
Yes, uh, they were
wonderful days.

06:10.404 --> 06:13.173
Uh, how did you get my number?

06:13.173 --> 06:14.708
From your brother.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.277
He gave me your address, too.

06:17.277 --> 06:20.714
Uh, why don't I pick you up,
say, about 8:00?

06:20.714 --> 06:21.815
BETSY:
8:00.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.451
ELMO:

06:24.451 --> 06:25.452
(click, dial tone)

06:25.452 --> 06:27.287
BETSY:
So, what do you think?

06:27.287 --> 06:29.289
It's an old dress.

06:29.289 --> 06:31.725
Just a little tight...

06:31.725 --> 06:34.594
here and here.

06:34.594 --> 06:36.430
Oh, and there.

06:36.430 --> 06:37.864
(sighs)

06:37.864 --> 06:39.666
And there.

06:39.666 --> 06:42.836
Well, maybe ifl don't breathe
too much,

06:42.836 --> 06:49.242
he... he won't notice.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.244
Oh, who am | trying to kid?

06:51.244 --> 06:54.381
Maybe this wasn't such
a great idea.

06:54.381 --> 06:58.185
Maybe he won't show up.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.053
(knocking)

07:00.053 --> 07:03.056
He showed up.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.683
lt's open!

07:07.260 --> 07:09.421
(owl hooting in distance)

07:11.798 --> 07:13.467
Betsy?

07:13.467 --> 07:14.957
Elmo?

07:16.636 --> 07:20.774
Well, uh, you-you certainly look
healthy.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.110
Thank you.
And you look shiny.

07:23.110 --> 07:27.381
Yeah, well, I'm just glad
to be looking at all, if, uh...

07:27.381 --> 07:29.249
Well, you know what I mean.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.017
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

07:30.017 --> 07:33.387
Uh... did you ever marry?

07:33.387 --> 07:34.821
Uh, no, no.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.056
-You see, I've been traveling.
-Oh.

07:36.056 --> 07:38.425
You know, I've always wanted
to travel, yeah.

07:38.425 --> 07:39.860
BETSY:
Yeah.

07:39.860 --> 07:43.630
Well, H see that you've been
to the jungle here.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.698
What?

07:44.698 --> 07:46.900
H was just joking.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.902
I mean all of these-these
plants, you know?

07:48.902 --> 07:49.970
BETSY:
Yeah.

07:49.970 --> 07:54.236
Well, you look different.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.084
Are you hungry?

08:04.084 --> 08:07.019
(traditional Mexican
music plays)

08:11.158 --> 08:12.993
I know it's a lot of food.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.396
Believe me, I've tried
everything I can to lose weight.

08:16.396 --> 08:18.732
I've-I've done the water diet,

08:18.732 --> 08:21.968
the tea diet, the juice diet.
the no-diet diet.

08:21.968 --> 08:24.538
I even had my earlobes stapled.

08:24.538 --> 08:25.572
Didn't work.

08:25.572 --> 08:26.573
(weak laugh)

08:26.573 --> 08:28.875
Oh, I've wrapped myself
in cellophane,

08:28.875 --> 08:32.546
I wore weight belts, fat pants,
even suction pants.

08:32.546 --> 08:33.880
Suction pants?

08:33.880 --> 08:36.917
Mm, pants connected to a vacuum

08:36.917 --> 08:39.186
that's supposed to suck off
the pounds.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.520
It doesn't work.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.522
I looked into the liposuction
operation

08:42.522 --> 08:45.292
where they really open you up
and take out the fat,

08:45.292 --> 08:47.194
but that's too expensive.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.296
(watch beeping)

08:49.296 --> 08:51.565
Oh, uh, excuse me.

08:51.565 --> 08:54.432
l-l have to make
a-a telephone call.

09:13.753 --> 09:16.586
(frequency tuning)

09:18.525 --> 09:21.294
(screaming, shrieking)

09:21.294 --> 09:26.163
(screaming, sobbing)

09:29.436 --> 09:31.370
(frequency tuning)

09:35.976 --> 09:38.001
MALE VOICE:
No, no, no, come on!

09:43.650 --> 09:45.379
(Betsy gasps)

09:48.822 --> 09:50.056
Is there something wrong?

09:50.056 --> 09:52.659
No... l-l've got something
in my ear.

09:52.659 --> 09:54.060
I can't get it out.

09:54.060 --> 09:56.530
Oh, it's okay.

09:56.530 --> 09:58.932
This looks just great.

09:58.932 --> 10:02.060
(horrific screaming)

10:09.142 --> 10:10.410
(fleshy squish)

10:10.410 --> 10:11.570
(screaming continues)

10:18.685 --> 10:19.686
(music stops)

10:19.686 --> 10:21.677
Betsy?

10:25.425 --> 10:27.194
ELMO:
What's this?

10:27.194 --> 10:28.562
Elmo...

10:28.562 --> 10:30.897
I'm sorry I embarrassed you.

10:30.897 --> 10:34.234
I shouldn't go out.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.869
Oh, no.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.505
Betsy, are-are-are
you all right?

10:38.505 --> 10:39.806
You want to see a doctor?

10:39.806 --> 10:43.577
No...
No, you can just leave.

10:43.577 --> 10:45.045
I've ruined your night.

10:45.045 --> 10:48.148
Uh, someone left this
at your back door.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.316
What is it?

10:49.316 --> 10:50.517
I don't know.

10:50.517 --> 10:53.486
It says it's from
"Your weight is over."

10:53.486 --> 10:55.055
No.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.691
I'll, uh, open it.

10:57.691 --> 10:58.858
BETSY:
Good-bye.

10:58.858 --> 11:02.419
Betsy... could I say something?

11:04.097 --> 11:08.124
You were the prettiest
girl in our class.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.876
(door shuts)

11:16.876 --> 11:20.437
I'm not the most
beautiful girl anymore.

11:32.626 --> 11:34.427
Glasses.

11:34.427 --> 11:37.464
"Guaranteed weight loss
with regular use."

11:37.464 --> 11:39.523
(laughing)

11:43.837 --> 11:45.168
Guaranteed.

11:46.172 --> 11:47.730
(multiple voices):
Please don't...!

11:52.879 --> 11:55.248
Please don't eat us!

11:55.248 --> 11:59.309
Please don't eat us!
Please don't eat us!

12:04.224 --> 12:07.794
ALL: Please don't eat us!
Don't eat us!

12:07.794 --> 12:09.284
-No!
-Aah!

12:13.099 --> 12:15.402
FEMALE VOICE: I implore you
to stay your hand.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.137
MALE VOICE:
Yeah, she's right, lady.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.639
Give us a break here, huh?

12:19.639 --> 12:21.341
MALE VOICE 2:
We've done you no harm.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.443
Why abuse us so?

12:23.443 --> 12:26.646
What's the matter, lady,
cat got your tongue?

12:26.646 --> 12:28.214
Cat got my tongue?

12:28.214 --> 12:31.151
Hey, lady, whoa!
Just a simple question here.

12:31.151 --> 12:34.120
No. No!

12:34.120 --> 12:36.456
It's not a simple question
when a banana asks it.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.358
It's not a simple question
at all.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.760
Hey, you got a problem
with bananas, lady?

12:40.760 --> 12:42.829
Yes.

12:42.829 --> 12:45.665
Yes, with talking bananas,
yes, I do.

12:45.665 --> 12:47.867
Now, honey child, calm yourself.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.969
No need to get upset.

12:49.969 --> 12:53.173
Oh, this has got to be
some kind of, uh...

12:53.173 --> 12:56.743
I don't know, drug or dream.

12:56.743 --> 12:59.979
There are no chemicals
or psychoses involved here.

12:59.979 --> 13:01.414
Like yourself,

13:01.414 --> 13:04.484
we are living,
thinking entities.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.219
But people can't talk
to fruits.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.887
Your name Betsy?

13:07.887 --> 13:09.389
How did you know?

13:09.389 --> 13:12.058
BANANA: Your bald buddy
mentioned it about ten times.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.827
What do you think,
we can't hear?

13:13.827 --> 13:14.961
I can't believe this.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.063
You're not real.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.265
Are you going to let us live,

13:19.265 --> 13:21.201
or are you gonna nibble
and gnaw at us

13:21.201 --> 13:24.170
till we turn spotty brown
and die of exposure?

13:24.170 --> 13:27.407
Well, uh... is that painful?

13:27.407 --> 13:28.508
Painful?!

13:28.508 --> 13:31.111
Let me peel your skin
off, lady, huh?

13:31.111 --> 13:33.113
Humiliating, too.

13:33.113 --> 13:36.516
Left alone with no friends,
no one to talk to.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.185
You know how awful
that is, Betsy.

13:39.185 --> 13:40.887
Oh, I know how, I...

13:40.887 --> 13:42.789
We girls have to stick together.

13:42.789 --> 13:46.459
(laughing)

13:46.459 --> 13:48.518
I must be dreaming...
(laughing)

13:51.030 --> 13:53.828
It's been a long day.

13:56.069 --> 13:59.038
(fruit trio
humming "Brahms' Lullaby")

14:13.753 --> 14:15.744
(lullaby fading)

14:19.225 --> 14:21.989
ALL:
Good morning, Betsy.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.902
You aren't dreaming, Betsy.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.603
We are very real.

14:30.603 --> 14:33.173
I'm hungry.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.808
(all gasping)

14:34.808 --> 14:38.437
I'll-I'll see what's in
the refrigerator.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.586
(whimpering)

14:46.586 --> 14:48.154
Oh, no, it's all right.

14:48.154 --> 14:49.889
Try to relax.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.293
GRUFF MALE VOICE:
Yo, looking for trouble, lady?

14:53.293 --> 14:54.828
Uh, no.

14:54.828 --> 14:58.298
That's good, 'cause I could
give you a lot of trouble.

14:58.298 --> 14:59.098
You could?

14:59.098 --> 15:01.828
Indigestion for days.

15:06.439 --> 15:09.306
I've got to eat something.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.178
(gelatin whimpering)

15:12.178 --> 15:14.646
ROAST: Hey, you, can't
a guy have any privacy?

15:19.619 --> 15:22.255
I'm very hungry.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.457
(stomach rumbling)

15:24.457 --> 15:26.960
Wouldn't you like
banana souffle?

15:26.960 --> 15:29.529
Think about pears--
chocolate-covered pears.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.197
How about some apple strudel?

15:31.197 --> 15:32.565
Banana flambé.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.568
Noodles, a crisp apple flan,
apple tart.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.537
Ginger pears, pickled pears,

15:37.537 --> 15:40.306
spiced, diced pear pie!

15:40.306 --> 15:41.341
(chuckles)

15:41.341 --> 15:43.510
You're very cute.

15:43.510 --> 15:44.911
I couldn't eat any of you.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.613
It'd be like
cold-blooded murder.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.604
(phone ringing)

15:52.218 --> 15:53.620
Hello?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.588
Betsy? It's Elmo.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.223
Elmo?

15:57.223 --> 15:59.459
Listen, Betsy, I thought maybe
we could try

15:59.459 --> 16:01.761
to have dinner together again.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.162
How about your place?

16:03.162 --> 16:04.597
Dinner? Here?

16:04.597 --> 16:06.399
-(whimpering)
-I bet you're a great cook.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.067
My favorite's apple pie.

16:08.067 --> 16:11.671
BETSY:
No, no, I... I can't.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.806
l ca... I can't eat here.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.943
Okay, we'll... we'll go out.

16:16.943 --> 16:19.245
Elmo, you don't have
to just for old-times sake.

16:19.245 --> 16:21.681
8:00. See you then.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.615
(click, dial tone)

16:25.952 --> 16:27.647
(stomach gurgling)

16:31.291 --> 16:32.849
(all whimpering)

16:41.868 --> 16:44.270
You ever think about
getting old, Betsy?

16:44.270 --> 16:45.905
Sometimes.

16:45.905 --> 16:49.242
Your flesh gets soft, age spots,
you get wrinkled,

16:49.242 --> 16:51.010
you start to smell.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.046
I don't think
I want to think about it.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.081
It's not a pretty thought.

16:55.081 --> 16:57.951
Maybe old age isn't all
it's cracked up to be.

16:57.951 --> 17:00.653
Maybe it's better to be
demolished and digested

17:00.653 --> 17:05.992
while I'm still young and sweet
and succulent and... gorgeous.

17:05.992 --> 17:11.497
You do look young
and sweet and succulent

17:11.497 --> 17:16.336
and tasty, juicy, edible...

17:16.336 --> 17:18.702
Lady, control yourself, here!

17:19.339 --> 17:21.908
Oh, my God.

17:21.908 --> 17:23.843
What was I doing?

17:23.843 --> 17:25.378
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.746
I'm sorry, pear.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.881
I don't want to hurt you.

17:28.881 --> 17:32.352
I'm just light-headed, and
I don't know what I'm doing.

17:32.352 --> 17:35.287
And my stomach is screaming
for food.

17:36.923 --> 17:38.324
(knocking)

17:38.324 --> 17:40.593
Betsy, it's Elmo.

17:40.593 --> 17:43.096
(gasps)
Don't let him in, Betsy.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.131
You never know what he might do.

17:45.131 --> 17:47.467
The stupid jerk might
try and eat us.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.002
ELMO:
Are you ready, Betsy?

17:49.002 --> 17:51.838
I'm so hungry I could
eat a horse.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.840
Pretend you're not here.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.508
(knocking)

17:55.508 --> 17:58.144
Betsy, are you in there?

17:58.144 --> 18:01.514
(footsteps departing)

18:01.514 --> 18:03.449
APPLE:
Commendable, Betsy.

18:03.449 --> 18:04.751
Thank you.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.353
I could almost feel
his teeth on my core.

18:07.353 --> 18:10.823
(phone ringing)

18:10.823 --> 18:13.626
(gasps)
It's him, I know it.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.595
He's calling from the corner.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.063
Don't answer, Betsy, please.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.599
(clatters)

18:24.804 --> 18:26.472
(laughing)

18:26.472 --> 18:28.641
Hello, snookums.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.510
Mama's gonna feed you now.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.545
Doesn't that taste good?

18:32.545 --> 18:35.275
Mama wants to eat,
too, but Mama can't.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.487
(sobbing):
I'm so hungry.

18:41.487 --> 18:45.091
We're your friends.

18:45.091 --> 18:46.559
That's what we're here for.

18:46.559 --> 18:49.162
That's not what you're here for.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.930
You're food.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.366
You're here to be eaten,

18:53.366 --> 18:55.902
so that I can live,
so that I can feel good.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.371
You're here for me to eat.

18:58.371 --> 19:01.774
She's losing it.
It's nutso time.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.576
Oh, for years,

19:03.576 --> 19:07.213
I tried everything
I could think of to lose weight.

19:07.213 --> 19:10.083
l have tried
every trick in the book.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.185
None of them worked.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.620
That's what you are.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.556
You're a gimmick.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.291
You're a trick,
so that I won't eat.

19:18.291 --> 19:21.260
Just a pair of trick glasses
and a trick hearing aid.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.932
It won't come off.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.633
Oh, my God.

19:27.633 --> 19:30.830
This is our Waterloo.

19:31.904 --> 19:34.207
I can't help it.

19:34.207 --> 19:35.435
Don't, Betsy!

19:36.309 --> 19:37.477
(whimpering)

19:37.477 --> 19:39.746
(screaming)

19:39.746 --> 19:42.482
I need food.

19:42.482 --> 19:43.883
Oh, lady, don't eat me!

19:43.883 --> 19:45.451
Think about what you're doing!

19:45.451 --> 19:47.019
No! Stop!
Don't eat me, please!

19:47.019 --> 19:48.054
No!

19:48.054 --> 19:49.489
(screaming)

19:49.489 --> 19:50.990
You're killing him!

19:50.990 --> 19:52.125
Murder!

19:52.125 --> 19:53.493
I'm sorry.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.229
-BANANA: Aah! Don't!
-|'m sorry.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.898
(screaming)

19:58.898 --> 20:00.833
Oh, my God.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.926
I almost killed...

20:04.537 --> 20:06.368
Forgive me.

20:07.473 --> 20:09.964
Please say you'll forgive me.

20:15.481 --> 20:19.519
It'll never happen again.

20:19.519 --> 20:23.979
I promise you,
it'll never happen again.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.629
ELMO: l-l'm sorry to put you
through all this trouble,

20:29.629 --> 20:31.364
but it's been two whole months

20:31.364 --> 20:33.900
and l was starting
to get worried about her.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.269
Well, I was coming by to collect
the rent, anyway.

20:36.269 --> 20:38.328
She's two months behind.

20:39.639 --> 20:41.874
Anybody home?

20:41.874 --> 20:43.276
(insects buzzing)

20:43.276 --> 20:44.277
(coughing. gagging)

20:44.277 --> 20:46.268
What's that smell?

20:47.280 --> 20:50.349
Oh, oh, what the hell is...?

20:50.349 --> 20:52.010
Betsy? !

21:19.679 --> 21:23.482
NARRATOR:
The dark side is always there.

21:23.482 --> 21:26.018
Waiting for us to enter.

21:26.018 --> 21:29.255
Waiting to enter us.

21:29.255 --> 21:35.785
Until next time, try
to enjoy the daylight.
