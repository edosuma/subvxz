Is it me, or does David Ortiz

00:36.553 --> 00:38.722
look just like the mom
on Good Times?

00:38.755 --> 00:41.458
-Oh, Peter, that's racist.
-Well, no. Look.

00:43.993 --> 00:45.262
I take it back.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.564
That's not racist.
That's just accurate.

00:47.597 --> 00:49.433
Hey, guys,
guess who's got the keys

00:49.466 --> 00:51.968
to a speedboat just
sitting down at the station?

00:52.001 --> 00:53.603
How'd you get a speedboat?

00:53.637 --> 00:55.905
Well, it's a funny story.

00:55.939 --> 00:58.408
(laughter)

00:58.442 --> 01:00.244
That was a funny story.

01:00.277 --> 01:01.911
Especially the funny part.

01:01.945 --> 01:03.813
You really delivered
on your promise.

01:03.847 --> 01:05.949
All right,
who's up for waterskiing?!

01:05.982 --> 01:07.751
-Hell yeah!
-All right!

01:07.784 --> 01:09.253
Yeah, let's do it!

01:09.286 --> 01:12.055
Oh, that sounds amazing!
I love boats.

01:12.088 --> 01:13.423
Boats are my thing.

01:13.457 --> 01:16.460
Anything to get out on the
open water, enjoy the salt air.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.794
Oh, they're already gone.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.463
PETER:
No, you didn't widen enough.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.665
But you still can't come.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.437
Good evening, Quahog.
Just parking.

01:27.471 --> 01:28.805
Be there in a sec.

01:28.838 --> 01:30.840
(footsteps running)

01:30.874 --> 01:32.276
Our top story:

01:32.309 --> 01:35.445
authorities have uncovered a
mob-run prescription drug ring

01:35.479 --> 01:37.247
targeting Goldman's Pharmacy.

01:37.281 --> 01:39.516
The scam involved
fraudulent prescriptions

01:39.549 --> 01:41.251
submitted for dead people.

01:41.285 --> 01:43.353
Pharmacist Mort Goldman
failed to report

01:43.387 --> 01:44.921
to authorities for questioning.

01:44.954 --> 01:48.258
A $10,000 bounty has been
offered for his return.

01:48.292 --> 01:50.660
$10,000?
That's a lot of money.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.362
Could be our money, Brian.

01:52.396 --> 01:54.631
We could find Mort. Easily.

01:54.664 --> 01:56.466
Besides, we haven't done
anything together

01:56.500 --> 01:59.469
since our confusing
two-host talk show.

01:59.503 --> 02:01.805
So, Chris Pratt,
I hear you have a new movie out.

02:01.838 --> 02:03.207
So, Chris, you're from Seattle?

02:03.240 --> 02:05.008
Chris, what was it like
working with Amy Poehler?

02:05.041 --> 02:06.943
Hey, Chris, anything you can
tell us about Guardians 3?

02:06.976 --> 02:08.378
-Chris! Chris!
-Chris! Chris!

02:08.412 --> 02:10.046
-Chris Pratt, always a pleasure.
-Well, that's all the time

02:10.079 --> 02:11.215
we have with Chris Pratt.

02:11.248 --> 02:12.449
BOTH:
Take it away,

02:12.482 --> 02:13.983
-multiracial modern band!
-retro swing guys!

02:14.017 --> 02:16.019
-(both bands playing)
-MALE ANNOUNCERS: Guests of

02:16.052 --> 02:18.021
-The Stewie Griffin Show stay
-The Brian Griffin Show stay

02:18.054 --> 02:20.190
-at the Essex House.
-at the W Times Square.

02:20.224 --> 02:22.826
(seagulls squawking)

02:25.429 --> 02:27.397
Waterskiing!

02:27.431 --> 02:29.433
-All right!
-Water-sitting!

02:37.106 --> 02:38.908
You got to cut to the right.

02:38.942 --> 02:41.678
No, no, it's counterintuitive.
You got to cut left.

02:41.711 --> 02:43.713
I know how to drive.

02:49.219 --> 02:51.721
-(horns honking)
-Stop looking at us!

02:58.728 --> 03:01.731
Ugh! Maybe we won't be going
waterskiing today.

03:01.765 --> 03:03.166
Shut up, Joe.

03:03.199 --> 03:05.502
Hey, you want some help?
I do this all the time.

03:05.535 --> 03:07.871
(bleep) Get back in your car
with your wife!

03:10.907 --> 03:14.043
When you're going backwards,
everything's the opposite.

03:14.077 --> 03:16.746
Oh, really?
Thanks, driving instructor.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.601
I feel like
everyone watching knows

03:37.634 --> 03:40.637
I'm incapable of
pleasing my wife sexually.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.408
Now cut the wheel.
Cut the wheel!

03:44.441 --> 03:47.243
No, the other way!

03:47.277 --> 03:48.978
(engine revving)

03:49.012 --> 03:50.347
(tires screech)

04:02.326 --> 04:04.661
Ah, hell, we're gonna be
on the Internet.

04:09.933 --> 04:13.069
-(metal scraping)
-(Quagmire sighs)

04:13.102 --> 04:14.838
You know what? Screw it.

04:20.710 --> 04:22.512
Let's boat!

04:27.551 --> 04:29.252
Cleveland,
aren't you waterskiing?

04:29.285 --> 04:31.655
-I don't like getting wet.
-Oh, come on.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.190
What's the worst
that could happen? (laughs)

04:34.223 --> 04:37.361
(yelling)

04:37.394 --> 04:40.029
(creatures shrieking,
chittering)

04:44.233 --> 04:46.235
(people screaming, clamoring)

04:59.182 --> 05:02.519
Mort must have panicked after
the pharmacy bust and fled town.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.153
If we're gonna collect
our ten grand,

05:04.187 --> 05:06.222
we need to figure out
where he went.

05:08.425 --> 05:10.894
Crap. His computer is
password-protected.

05:10.927 --> 05:14.030
Um, try "Such heat this day."

05:14.063 --> 05:15.399
-(beep)
-Nope.

05:15.432 --> 05:19.035
How about "This fish is cold,
I want a refund"?

05:19.068 --> 05:20.637
-(beep)
-No.

05:20.670 --> 05:23.206
"But I lost the receipt."

05:23.239 --> 05:25.208
-(beep)
-Bingo.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.543
Aha!

05:26.576 --> 05:29.546
A confirmed plane ticket
to Boca Raton.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.581
Looks like
we're going to Florida.

05:33.783 --> 05:36.386
They must have figured out
where the pharmacist is.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.321
We got to get to him first.

05:38.354 --> 05:40.356
We're going to Florida, too.

05:40.390 --> 05:42.258
I know the answer is no,

05:42.291 --> 05:44.761
but is there any chance
there's time

05:44.794 --> 05:48.097
for the Wizarding World
of Harry Potter?

05:48.131 --> 05:52.068
Tony, what if the answer
is a resounding yes?

05:52.101 --> 05:54.103
(laughs)
Oh!

05:58.542 --> 05:59.909
Oh!

06:02.378 --> 06:05.281
♪

06:17.293 --> 06:18.795
What the hell?

06:20.964 --> 06:22.799
(panting)
Oh. Oh, God!

06:22.832 --> 06:25.635
(yelling)

06:27.804 --> 06:30.640
Oh, my God! That shark's
attacking Quagmire!

06:30.674 --> 06:32.642
I think it's got him
by the wiener!

06:32.676 --> 06:35.111
Man, that guy can get anyone
to do that to him.

06:35.144 --> 06:37.146
(yelling)

06:42.686 --> 06:44.454
(panting)

06:44.488 --> 06:47.256
-Quagmire, are you okay?
-Do I look okay?!

06:47.290 --> 06:48.658
I think you'll be fine.

06:48.692 --> 06:51.961
You just got to wipe that
squashed tomato off your crotch.

06:56.666 --> 06:57.834
(all gasp)

06:57.867 --> 07:00.336
Oh, my God!
Quagmire lost his penis!

07:00.369 --> 07:02.338
All right, we got to let
all the other boats know.

07:02.371 --> 07:04.508
What is it again?
White flag for "friendly,"

07:04.541 --> 07:07.644
black for "not friendly,"
blue flag for "penis loss"?

07:10.346 --> 07:12.482
Oh, man, that sucks.

07:20.356 --> 07:23.927
Doc, give it to us straight.
What's going on with our friend?

07:23.960 --> 07:26.295
Well, Mr. Griffin,
there's no easy way to put this,

07:26.329 --> 07:28.665
so I'm just gonna
come right out and say it.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.834
-He's black.
-Not that friend. Quagmire.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.769
Oh, him.
Well, Mr. Quagmire,

07:32.802 --> 07:34.871
you've had quite
the nasty shark attack.

07:34.904 --> 07:36.372
Luckily, you'll be okay.

07:36.405 --> 07:39.175
But you're going to have to
learn to live without a penis.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.444
Or will you?

07:41.477 --> 07:43.279
Oh, what's this?

07:43.312 --> 07:45.314
Is it... your penis?

07:45.348 --> 07:46.816
Nah, I'm just foolin'.

07:46.850 --> 07:49.519
I play that with my penis-less
patients to lighten the mood.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.621
Liev Schreiber gets
a big kick out of it.

07:51.655 --> 07:54.057
Doc, do you know
who you're talking to?

07:54.090 --> 07:56.993
-That penis was my whole life!
-It's not so bad.

07:57.026 --> 07:58.628
At least you're not
this pathetic guy

07:58.662 --> 08:00.396
who couldn't get his boat
in the water.

08:00.429 --> 08:02.031
(laughs)
Have you seen this?

08:02.065 --> 08:04.801
You should take his wiener.
He's clearly not using it.

08:04.834 --> 08:06.803
-(engine revving)
-PETER: Stop looking at us!

08:06.836 --> 08:09.205
(laughter)

08:09.238 --> 08:13.409
Ah, that... that does...
that does make me feel better.

08:22.185 --> 08:25.021
-What are we doing here?
-This is Pitbull's house.

08:25.054 --> 08:27.256
He knows everything
about South Florida.

08:27.290 --> 08:28.825
He can help us find Mort.

08:28.858 --> 08:31.194
DOORBELL (Pitbull's voice):
Doorbell, doorbell,

08:31.227 --> 08:32.528
doorbell, ring.

08:32.562 --> 08:33.897
(laughs)
It's my house.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.699
Esta mi casa.

08:35.732 --> 08:40.103
Wow. Imagine kind of knowing
two languages.

08:40.136 --> 08:43.106
Hang on. I'm in the middle
of writing a song.

08:43.139 --> 08:45.108
♪ Tingta tongka
te tong tong tink. ♪

08:45.141 --> 08:46.610
(laughs)
That's a hit.

08:46.643 --> 08:49.012
What can I do for you,
my friends amigos?

08:49.045 --> 08:51.214
I told you.
This guy's the real deal.

08:51.247 --> 08:53.617
We're looking for a friend
who's hiding out down here.

08:53.650 --> 08:56.052
He's a Jewish pharmacist
from Rhode Island.

08:56.085 --> 08:57.954
-Coral Palm Motel.
-Told you.

08:57.987 --> 08:59.956
RADIO DJ:
And here's Pitbull
with his newest hit,

08:59.989 --> 09:02.291
"Tingta Tongka
Te Tong Tong Tink."

09:02.325 --> 09:04.327
(heavy dance beat playing)

09:05.962 --> 09:08.031
Adios good-bye, amigo friends.

09:08.064 --> 09:11.500
I got to go get paid to scream
"Make some noise!" in Vegas.

09:16.673 --> 09:19.142
(knock on door)

09:21.244 --> 09:23.246
I think I hear Mort
in the bathroom.

09:23.279 --> 09:24.981
MORT:
Come on, urine, you can do this!

09:25.014 --> 09:27.483
It's just like your toilet
at home. Please!

09:27.516 --> 09:30.620
It's been five days now.
Why won't you just cooperate?!

09:30.654 --> 09:32.321
-(floorboard creaks)
-Is someone out there?

09:32.355 --> 09:33.923
(high-pitched):
Housekeeping!

09:33.957 --> 09:36.325
Oh, come on in.
I'm just urinating.

09:36.359 --> 09:39.462
Tinkle, tinkle, splash, splash,
swoosh. Yeah, look at...

09:39.495 --> 09:41.330
Oh, boy, what a healthy stream!

09:41.364 --> 09:43.332
-Will it ever end?
-(zips pants)

09:43.366 --> 09:45.568
What are you guys doing here?

09:45.601 --> 09:49.338
We're taking you back to Quahog
to collect our reward.

09:49.372 --> 09:51.440
Oh, no, I can't go back there.

09:51.474 --> 09:53.643
-The mob will kill me!
-(phone chimes)

09:53.677 --> 09:55.344
-Ha!
-What?

09:55.378 --> 09:58.181
A shark bit
Quagmire's penis off.

09:58.214 --> 09:59.649
Ha.

10:03.319 --> 10:05.288
I can't believe it.
This is horrible.

10:05.321 --> 10:07.290
-What am I gonna do?
-Come on, now.

10:07.323 --> 10:09.292
Keep that enormous chin up,
Glenn.

10:09.325 --> 10:10.994
There's lots you can do.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.962
You could devote your life
to Christ,

10:12.996 --> 10:14.698
or become a eunuch.

10:14.731 --> 10:16.599
Cleveland, why don't you
sit this one out?

10:16.632 --> 10:18.501
Listen, Quagmire,
I got just the way

10:18.534 --> 10:20.704
for you to embrace your new life
without a penis.

10:20.737 --> 10:22.205
I've had this computer blocked

10:22.238 --> 10:24.540
so you can discover
all the other exciting things

10:24.573 --> 10:27.176
-on the Internet besides porn.
-Like what?

10:27.210 --> 10:29.879
Well, uh, there's, uh...

10:29.913 --> 10:32.982
I like to research birds.
Try to learn a bird a day.

10:33.016 --> 10:34.617
Well, not that, necessarily,
but, uh...

10:34.650 --> 10:36.052
You got your robin.

10:36.085 --> 10:38.187
Wow, you really know
your stuff, Joe.

10:38.221 --> 10:39.889
-Your swallow.
-Swallow?

10:39.923 --> 10:41.891
Uh, actually this is
what we're trying to avoid.

10:41.925 --> 10:43.226
You got your titmouse.

10:43.259 --> 10:45.061
Damn it, Joe,
stop with the sex birds!

10:45.094 --> 10:47.063
Look, I appreciate
what you're trying to do, guys,

10:47.096 --> 10:48.497
but this is a disaster.

10:48.531 --> 10:50.633
You don't understand
what that penis meant to me.

10:50.666 --> 10:52.568
We did everything together.

10:52.601 --> 10:54.738
Absolutely everything.

10:54.771 --> 10:58.141
"As she tenderly unlaced
her silken corset,

10:58.174 --> 11:00.844
"Jennifer shuddered
in anticipation of...

11:02.611 --> 11:05.114
...the sensual night ahead."

11:10.453 --> 11:11.921
This is not good.

11:11.955 --> 11:13.589
As soon as I'm back in Quahog,

11:13.622 --> 11:15.424
-the mob is gonna kill me!
-I don't care.

11:15.458 --> 11:17.193
We're getting the hell
out of Florida.

11:17.226 --> 11:19.195
Florida.
Which, interesting trivia,

11:19.228 --> 11:21.330
was the name of the mom
in Good Times

11:21.364 --> 11:23.332
-played by David Ortiz.
-(tires screeching)

11:23.366 --> 11:25.935
Uh-oh, looks like the mob
knew we were coming.

11:25.969 --> 11:27.771
It's him! Get him!

11:27.804 --> 11:29.338
Oh, no! We're done for!

11:29.372 --> 11:32.809
No, we're not. I'm the fastest
Jew in the world.

11:42.218 --> 11:45.454
Crap. They got Mort.
There goes our reward.

11:45.488 --> 11:47.456
Well, maybe we were
in over our heads.

11:47.490 --> 11:50.426
Like an announcer who knows
nothing about his sport.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.628
ANNOUNCER 1:
He's got about 190 yards
to the hole.

11:52.661 --> 11:54.964
Looks like he's going
for his 5-iron.

11:54.998 --> 11:57.133
And those greens
are playing very fast,

11:57.166 --> 11:59.268
so he's gonna have to use
caution on his approach.

11:59.302 --> 12:00.870
ANNOUNCER 2:
Yeah, yeah.

12:00.904 --> 12:02.138
ANNOUNCER 1:
Jordan Spieth, of course,

12:02.171 --> 12:03.472
having a great tournament.

12:03.506 --> 12:05.108
He birdied this hole yesterday.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.777
ANNOUNCER 2:
Is that right? Wow.

12:07.811 --> 12:10.479
ANNOUNCER 1:
And he hits a great shot,
right on the green.

12:10.513 --> 12:12.148
ANNOUNCER 2:
Yeah, yeah.

12:12.181 --> 12:15.819
How, uh... how do you win golf?

12:19.522 --> 12:21.757
TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to HGTV's

12:21.791 --> 12:23.259
Couples Looking for a House

12:23.292 --> 12:25.829
Where the Woman
Doesn't Know the Guy's Gay.

12:25.862 --> 12:27.997
Well, I'm looking for a place
with good schools,

12:28.031 --> 12:29.665
and, because he works
in the city,

12:29.698 --> 12:31.334
he's looking for
an easy commute.

12:31.367 --> 12:33.236
Yeah, she teaches here
at the high school

12:33.269 --> 12:36.172
and I work in town as
a choreographer and florist.

12:36.205 --> 12:38.574
And we'll probably need
a nursery.

12:38.607 --> 12:40.609
Well, that's a discussion.

12:40.643 --> 12:41.878
(doorbell rings)

12:42.879 --> 12:44.647
-Oh, hey, Quagmire.
-Hey, Peter.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.149
I just came by to thank you

12:46.182 --> 12:48.151
for giving me the kick
in the pants I needed

12:48.184 --> 12:49.685
to stop feeling sorry for myself

12:49.718 --> 12:51.821
-and embrace my new life.
-I farted.

12:51.855 --> 12:54.190
As a result,
I've rediscovered an old hobby

12:54.223 --> 12:56.659
I used to love as a kid:
ventriloquism.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.862
And I wanted to invite you guys
to the opening

12:58.895 --> 13:00.864
of my new show
at the Quahog Playhouse.

13:00.897 --> 13:03.833
Quagmire, we'd be delighted
to attend. Wouldn't miss it.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.935
Gosh, thanks, Peter.
That means a lot.

13:05.969 --> 13:07.603
Okay, see you there.

13:07.636 --> 13:10.206
Damn it!
Why did I even open the door?!

13:10.239 --> 13:11.975
Ugh!

13:12.008 --> 13:14.210
Getting excited.

13:14.243 --> 13:17.713
Now I got to go to this thing!
Ugh! Bite me!

13:17.746 --> 13:20.383
Laughing already
just thinking about it.

13:20.416 --> 13:22.218
Only one way to get out of this!

13:22.251 --> 13:23.586
(gunshot)

13:33.930 --> 13:37.533
Oh, I'm so glad Quagmire's
back on his feet again.

13:37.566 --> 13:40.236
PETER:
God, this is gonna be torture.

13:40.269 --> 13:42.071
Break a leg.

13:42.105 --> 13:43.206
Oh, hello.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.807
I didn't realize
the curtain was up.

13:44.840 --> 13:47.810
-And people think I'm the dummy.
-(Peter laughs)

13:47.843 --> 13:50.079
CHRIS:
How is that doll talking?!

13:50.113 --> 13:51.747
I'm Glenn, and this is Edgar.

13:51.780 --> 13:54.683
What a great crowd, huh, Edgar?
This is gonna be a fun night.

13:54.717 --> 13:56.019
You call this fun?

13:56.052 --> 13:58.321
You're talking to a wooden doll
to make up for the fact

13:58.354 --> 14:00.023
that you can't have sex anymore.

14:00.056 --> 14:01.690
(chuckles)
Come on, come on, Edgar.

14:01.724 --> 14:03.259
That's-that's not true.

14:03.292 --> 14:05.761
Besides, if you've got all the
answers, what do you suggest?

14:05.794 --> 14:07.196
Here's a suggestion.

14:07.230 --> 14:10.166
Blow your (bleep) brains out
in front of all these people.

14:10.199 --> 14:12.335
Is this... is this real?

14:12.368 --> 14:13.836
(chuckles):
Oh, c-come on, Edgar.

14:13.869 --> 14:16.272
I-I got a lot to live for
according to everybody.

14:16.305 --> 14:17.773
I'm not gonna kill myself.

14:17.806 --> 14:19.742
-Well, then, maybe I can help.
-(gun cocks)

14:19.775 --> 14:21.610
-(crowd gasps)
-Quagmire, no!

14:21.644 --> 14:24.914
JOE:
Oh, God, Peter's here.
I so don't want to talk to him.

14:24.948 --> 14:27.683
Hey, buddy.
We got to catch up.

14:27.716 --> 14:29.718
Well, Edgar, if you think
that would be best.

14:29.752 --> 14:31.454
Yes, you'll be
out of your misery.

14:31.487 --> 14:33.622
CHRIS:
I think it's the guy talking!

14:33.656 --> 14:36.092
Quagmire, have you lost
your mind?!

14:36.125 --> 14:39.762
I'm holding this gun until
you start thinking straight.

14:40.997 --> 14:42.966
GUN:
Use it on yourself, Joe.

14:42.999 --> 14:45.468
There's more than
one bullet in here, Joe.

14:45.501 --> 14:48.938
Yeah, on second thought, maybe
you should hold this, Cleveland.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.773
GUN:
Are you really gonna
just sit there

14:50.806 --> 14:54.877
after all the crap white people
have given you your whole life?

14:54.910 --> 14:58.281
You know, maybe you should
hold this, Peter.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.684
GUN:
Peter, you could
get free tacos with me.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.753
It worked!

15:11.627 --> 15:14.730
Quagmire, why the hell
would you want to kill yourself?

15:14.763 --> 15:17.266
Yeah, who ever heard of
a depressed ventriloquist?

15:17.300 --> 15:20.403
You want to know why?
Because I can't do this anymore.

15:20.436 --> 15:22.105
My life is over.

15:22.138 --> 15:25.574
I tried to adjust,
but it's impossible.

15:25.608 --> 15:28.111
Come on, Quagmire,
it's not impossible.

15:28.144 --> 15:30.579
You want impossible,
try eating local pizza

15:30.613 --> 15:32.248
with a guy from New York.

15:32.281 --> 15:34.250
You call this pizza?

15:34.283 --> 15:36.285
We do here, yes.

15:39.955 --> 15:42.091
All right, Brian,
I negotiated to get Mort

15:42.125 --> 15:43.926
-back from the mob.
-How?

15:43.959 --> 15:45.928
I told them Mort gave us
his flash drive

15:45.961 --> 15:48.131
with enough evidence
to put them all in jail.

15:48.164 --> 15:51.100
We're going to trade it for Mort
and collect our money.

15:51.134 --> 15:54.270
And I also ordered
an extra slice of pie.

15:54.303 --> 15:56.539
Because you know how many times
we live, Brian?

15:56.572 --> 15:58.041
Once.

15:58.074 --> 16:00.109
(snickers)
Once.

16:00.143 --> 16:02.378
(both laugh)

16:06.682 --> 16:08.484
(doorbell rings)

16:10.886 --> 16:13.522
-Hey, Dad.
-I'm so sorry, Glenn.

16:13.556 --> 16:14.957
Stop staring, Cleveland!

16:14.990 --> 16:16.792
CLEVELAND:
I can support his lifestyle

16:16.825 --> 16:18.694
and still think it's weird!

16:18.727 --> 16:21.564
-Thank you, Cleveland.
-Have a blessed day!

16:22.998 --> 16:26.069
Believe me, Glenn, I know
what you're going through.

16:26.102 --> 16:27.236
No, you don't.

16:27.270 --> 16:29.538
You had yours surgically removed
in a hospital.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.374
I had mine
bitten off by a shark!

16:31.407 --> 16:33.642
I'm not allowed to go
into the ocean anymore.

16:33.676 --> 16:36.812
The doctor says
I can't get seawater in it.

16:36.845 --> 16:39.648
I also have Crohn's disease.
They're unrelated.

16:39.682 --> 16:41.150
Why are you here, Dad?

16:41.184 --> 16:42.818
I knew you were
down in the dumps,

16:42.851 --> 16:44.820
so I brought you something
to cheer you up.

16:44.853 --> 16:46.822
A Yeti cooler?

16:46.855 --> 16:49.058
-That is kind of rad.
-No, that's mine.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.526
Your gift is inside.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.996
♪

16:54.029 --> 16:55.431
Is that your...?

16:55.464 --> 16:58.033
Yes, Glenn. It's my penis.

16:58.067 --> 17:00.503
After my surgery,
I kept it in my freezer.

17:00.536 --> 17:03.606
Next to a snowball from the
winter, if you can believe that.

17:03.639 --> 17:05.608
I want you to have it.

17:05.641 --> 17:08.411
I... I can't take
your penis, Dad.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.912
Please, take it.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.381
If you don't, I'm just gonna
give it to Paul Ryan.

17:12.415 --> 17:14.217
I don't know what to say.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.352
Thank you.

17:16.385 --> 17:17.686
(singsongy):
Weird.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.723
Proud of you guys, but weird.

17:24.093 --> 17:26.562
(monitor beeping steadily)

17:26.595 --> 17:29.031
Okay, has everyone
washed their hands?

17:29.064 --> 17:31.700
Me neither,
but going forward, let's try.

17:31.734 --> 17:33.536
I'm so nervous for Quagmire.

17:33.569 --> 17:36.572
I know, but it's nice that they
served hot dogs for the surgery.

17:36.605 --> 17:38.707
There it is! Give me that!

17:38.741 --> 17:41.244
-(monitor beeping steadily)
-♪

17:44.913 --> 17:48.083
Nurse, you put it on there.
I'm not gay.

17:52.788 --> 17:54.823
The operation was a success.

17:54.857 --> 17:57.893
-Congratulations, Quagmire!
-Thanks, guys.

17:57.926 --> 18:00.796
And, Dad, I don't know
how to thank you.

18:00.829 --> 18:04.066
You've given me the greatest
gift I could ever ask for.

18:04.099 --> 18:07.203
-I love you, son.
-I love you, too.

18:12.475 --> 18:14.910
-So, will it work, Dr. Hartman?
-Oh, yes.

18:14.943 --> 18:17.780
I'm not sure about urination
or sex, but otherwise, yes.

18:17.813 --> 18:19.248
So, how you feeling?

18:19.282 --> 18:21.284
I'm actually
in extreme pain, Doc.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.486
It's like knives are
stabbing into my crotch.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.920
Don't worry, that'll go away

18:24.953 --> 18:27.089
once you fill your prescription
at Goldman's Pharmacy.

18:27.122 --> 18:29.425
-Mort's is closed.
-Oh. Oh, yeah.

18:29.458 --> 18:31.794
Cool tie-in
with the other story, though.

18:31.827 --> 18:34.597
I'm trying to get more involved
in the writing this season.

18:34.630 --> 18:37.433
In fact, I think Family Guy
should be more of a dramedy.

18:37.466 --> 18:39.134
-What's a dramedy?
-Well, for one thing,

18:39.168 --> 18:41.804
the scenes don't have to end
with jokes.

18:48.010 --> 18:51.046
-You got the flash drive?
-Yep.

18:51.079 --> 18:53.449
All the information
that could put you away forever.

18:53.482 --> 18:55.284
Now, again,
I don't know why we couldn't

18:55.318 --> 18:56.652
have done this by Dropbox.

18:56.685 --> 18:58.987
I mean, I don't mind
coming here to a parking lot--

18:59.021 --> 19:02.225
I had to get Mort anyway-- but
Dropbox would've saved you time.

19:02.258 --> 19:04.627
And you wouldn't have
to mail me back my flash drive.

19:04.660 --> 19:06.329
What do you mean, mail it back?

19:06.362 --> 19:09.164
You were planning to keep it?
It's 64 gigs!

19:09.198 --> 19:11.800
I bought the coverage.
You're not getting the coverage.

19:11.834 --> 19:14.670
Hi, guys. I'm a pharmacist.

19:14.703 --> 19:18.474
Ugh, Mort is
so hard to write for.

19:18.507 --> 19:19.642
Okay, give us Mort.

19:19.675 --> 19:21.810
My mailing address
is in the flash drive.

19:21.844 --> 19:24.413
-(siren wailing)
-FBI! Freeze!

19:28.451 --> 19:29.952
What the hell is this?

19:33.121 --> 19:35.190
Thanks for your cooperation,
Mr. Goldman.

19:35.224 --> 19:37.760
Wait a minute.
You were working with the Feds?

19:37.793 --> 19:39.194
Absolutely.

19:39.228 --> 19:40.829
When I heard there was a reward,

19:40.863 --> 19:43.332
I immediately turned myself in.

19:43.366 --> 19:45.601
So you guys get bupkis.

19:45.634 --> 19:47.636
I'm a pharmacist.

19:49.137 --> 19:51.407
Well, Brian, we may not
have gotten the $10,000,

19:51.440 --> 19:52.908
but it'll be a joy

19:52.941 --> 19:54.943
(Dr. Hartman's voice):
to hear no more Jewish talk

19:54.977 --> 19:56.111
for a long while.

19:56.144 --> 19:58.847
"Brian and Stewie laugh.
The image freezes.

19:58.881 --> 20:00.249
The end."

20:00.283 --> 20:02.418
Ah, that was a good day's work.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.052
I've earned this.

20:06.289 --> 20:09.091
Little shot of
the ol' Sorkin genius juice.

20:16.399 --> 20:18.734
So, Quagmire,
how's the new rod holding up?

20:18.767 --> 20:21.370
Yeah, you know.
Good, pretty good.

20:21.404 --> 20:24.206
I've been having a lot of sex.
Um...

20:24.239 --> 20:26.809
My dad didn't mention there's a
four-inch mole on the left side.

20:26.842 --> 20:28.143
-What?
-Uh-huh.

20:28.176 --> 20:30.245
It's, like, the size
of a 50-cent piece

20:30.279 --> 20:33.115
-and a dime kissing each other.
-Yikes. Frightening.

20:33.148 --> 20:35.117
Yeah, some gals
find it off-putting.

20:35.150 --> 20:38.321
I try to tell them it's my dad's
old penis, but that, um...

20:38.354 --> 20:40.489
that just tends
to make it worse.

20:40.523 --> 20:42.491
But the girls that stay
are just great.

20:42.525 --> 20:44.327
Well, I'm happy for you,
Quagmire.

20:44.360 --> 20:47.095
Don't be.
Anyway, I got to take a leak.

20:47.129 --> 20:48.597
Well, I'm just glad our friend's

20:48.631 --> 20:50.333
-back to his old self.
-(Quagmire screaming)

20:50.366 --> 20:52.067
Yeah, seems he hasn't
missed a beat.

20:52.100 --> 20:55.471
It's great that we can be there
for each other in trying times.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.474
-What's that noise?
-(Quagmire continues screaming)

20:58.507 --> 21:01.444
That's the sound of peeing
out your daddy's wiener.
