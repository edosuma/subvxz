Erica:
My new therapist?

00:04.700 --> 00:06.633
What?
What're you talking about?

00:06.633 --> 00:08.633
Dr. Naadiah: Erica,
if you'll just sit down.

00:08.633 --> 00:10.666
I understand that you've
been through a lot.

00:10.666 --> 00:11.733
No you don't.

00:11.733 --> 00:13.666
Look, I'm sorry,
I don't mean to be rude,

00:13.666 --> 00:16.066
but I don't-
don't wanna sit.

00:17.166 --> 00:19.200
You're not my doctor,
and this isn't...

00:19.200 --> 00:20.633
This is not happening
like this.

00:20.633 --> 00:23.233
You know what?
I need to speak with Dr. Tom.

00:23.233 --> 00:24.300
Dr. Naadiah: You can't.

00:24.300 --> 00:25.266
Erica: why not?

00:25.266 --> 00:26.200
Where is he?

00:26.200 --> 00:27.500
At the beginning
of your therapy

00:27.500 --> 00:30.133
Dr. Tom told you that
this was about you, Erica,

00:30.133 --> 00:31.533
and no one else.

00:31.533 --> 00:33.733
Erica: And Dr. Tom also said
that we made a commitment...

00:33.733 --> 00:35.133
Dr. Naadiah:
Well yes, but...

00:35.133 --> 00:36.566
Erica: We made
a commitment together.

00:36.566 --> 00:38.600
Dr. Naadiah: No, Erica.
you made a commitment.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.666
And I'm here to help you
honour it.

00:40.666 --> 00:43.066
You're not done your list,
or your therapy.

00:43.066 --> 00:45.500
Are you punishing him
because he lost his temper?

00:45.500 --> 00:46.466
No.

00:46.466 --> 00:48.100
Because that
was my fault too.

00:48.100 --> 00:49.433
I broke my promise.

00:49.433 --> 00:53.066
And it wasn't just him,
he had a reason to be upset.

00:53.066 --> 00:54.333
No one is
punishing him.

00:54.333 --> 00:56.400
Then why
can't I see him?

00:58.300 --> 01:00.733
He's the one
who decided to quit.

01:00.733 --> 01:05.666
You can't see him because
he doesn't want to see you.

01:14.233 --> 01:16.066
(hushed heavy breaths)

01:18.000 --> 01:19.400
Erica: What are you
doing here?!

01:19.400 --> 01:21.400
You can't-you can't
just follow me here.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.600
Erica.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.000
My boyfriend is sleeping
right behind that door.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.133
This conversation
isn't over.

01:25.133 --> 01:26.533
Yes it is.

01:29.133 --> 01:31.633
Look, I'm sorry, I'm sure
that you are very qualified,

01:31.633 --> 01:35.166
but this has nothing
to do with you.

01:35.166 --> 01:38.400
I made a commitment
to Dr. Tom.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.700
So guess what?
If he quits, so do I.

01:43.300 --> 01:45.600
I'll give you
some time.

I grabbed her, Naadiah.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.466
I mean I got so angry.
I could feel it.

09:26.466 --> 09:28.133
It was just like before.

09:28.133 --> 09:29.600
I mean, I couldn't
think straight,

09:29.600 --> 09:33.600
I couldn't stop myself
even though I know that--

09:38.033 --> 09:40.533
She needs someone else.

09:40.533 --> 09:43.300
Someone who's
more together.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Like me.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.333
Uh, like you.

09:48.333 --> 09:50.566
So why does it feel
like you're running away?

09:50.566 --> 09:52.600
Well, I'm not.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.666
I've thought
this through.

09:54.666 --> 09:57.433
This is
the right choice--

09:58.433 --> 09:59.466
For Erica.

10:00.466 --> 10:03.366
"Fear is the mind killer."
Frank Herbert.

10:03.366 --> 10:04.300
Oh, don't.

10:04.300 --> 10:07.300
Yeah.
It's annoying, isn't it?

10:10.733 --> 10:12.233
(streetcar dings)

10:13.166 --> 10:15.600
I still can't believe it.
Brent, he has the seniority,

10:15.600 --> 10:19.033
he has the experience.
I just, ugh.

10:19.033 --> 10:20.333
I feel terrible.

10:20.333 --> 10:21.566
No.
No feeling terrible.

10:21.566 --> 10:24.233
You are not allowed
to feel guilty.

10:24.233 --> 10:26.766
Tonight is all about
how great things are.

10:26.766 --> 10:28.300
You're right.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.700
God, so much has changed
in the last six months.

10:30.700 --> 10:33.500
I just feel a million miles
away from where I was

10:33.500 --> 10:35.233
when you first
moved here.

10:37.533 --> 10:40.366
To your new project.

10:40.366 --> 10:42.333
To a fresh start.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.733
To leaving the past behind.

10:45.733 --> 10:47.466
To looking ahead.

10:47.466 --> 10:48.533
(glasses clink)

10:52.133 --> 10:53.333
(cell phone rings)

10:53.333 --> 10:56.400
Oh god, I'll totally
turn that thing off.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.533
Ethan:
Who's Dr. Naadiah?

10:58.533 --> 11:00.533
(phone rings)

11:00.533 --> 11:01.566
Um--

11:02.633 --> 11:05.033
That's just nobody.
It's just a--

11:05.033 --> 11:06.633
It's just work.
What're you gonna have?

11:06.633 --> 11:08.233
Oh, I was thinking
the risotto.

11:08.233 --> 11:10.033
Maitre d': Miss?
Are you Erica Strange?

11:10.033 --> 11:11.333
Yes?

11:11.333 --> 11:13.266
Maitre D': I have a Doctor
Naadiah on the phone for you.

11:13.266 --> 11:14.666
Ethan: What?
She's calling you here?

11:14.666 --> 11:16.533
Um, excuse me.

11:16.533 --> 11:18.333
I'm just gonna
take care of this.

11:18.333 --> 11:19.333
Okay, sorry.

11:21.366 --> 11:22.666
(whispers)
Hello!

11:22.666 --> 11:24.400
Sorry about the interruption,
but we need to talk.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.000
There is nothing
to talk about.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.666
I told you, I qui--

11:29.333 --> 11:30.733
--it.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.266
I'm concerned that you're
making an impulsive decision.

11:32.266 --> 11:34.133
You don't know me.
At all.

11:34.133 --> 11:36.566
I'm just asking you
to think it through.

11:36.566 --> 11:38.200
Is this really
what you want?

11:38.200 --> 11:39.266
(sighs)

11:40.700 --> 11:45.666
Yes, I have changed a lot
in the last six months.

11:45.666 --> 11:49.100
I'm in a relationship
with a man that I love.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.633
And my family, we're closer
than we've ever been.

11:51.633 --> 11:53.166
My career is taking off.

11:53.166 --> 11:54.133
That's wonderful.

11:54.133 --> 11:55.566
I'm in a different place
than I was

11:55.566 --> 11:58.166
when I started therapy.

11:58.166 --> 12:02.166
And honestly,
it feels like I'm done.

12:02.166 --> 12:05.533
So this has nothing to do
with Dr. Tom quitting?

12:05.533 --> 12:07.666
I thought you couldn't
talk about him.

12:07.666 --> 12:08.366
Erica.

12:08.366 --> 12:09.500
I'm done.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.066
Why do I have to keep
answering these questions?!

12:11.066 --> 12:12.200
Dr. Naadiah: You don't.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.300
If you really feel
like you want to quit,

12:14.300 --> 12:16.066
then you're free to go.

12:17.066 --> 12:18.066
Good.

12:19.766 --> 12:22.500
Once you've paid
your debt.

12:26.666 --> 12:27.533
I'm sorry?

12:27.533 --> 12:28.600
Dr. Naadiah: You heard me.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.300
It's time to settle
our accounts.

12:31.300 --> 12:32.466
Right--

12:32.466 --> 12:34.766
Now.

12:34.766 --> 12:36.700

a little bit upset.

13:45.666 --> 13:47.266
Okay, Strange,

13:47.266 --> 13:48.366
Just--

13:48.366 --> 13:49.400
Lu-meister understands

13:49.400 --> 13:51.233
Just,they come here

13:51.233 --> 13:53.633
All right, sweetie,

13:53.633 --> 13:54.466
You get it?

13:54.466 --> 13:55.366
Got it.

13:55.366 --> 13:57.066
Good, now go
make the rounds.

13:57.066 --> 14:00.066
Go. Just tighten
the top a little bit.

14:02.733 --> 14:03.733
(sighs)

14:12.366 --> 14:13.366
Thank you, red.

14:13.366 --> 14:14.566
I want to kill you!

14:14.566 --> 14:16.466
And add another
regret to your list?

14:16.466 --> 14:19.266
It's pretty long already.

14:20.666 --> 14:22.500
Erica: What,
what am I doing here?

14:22.500 --> 14:24.500
I don't even know
what year is it?

14:24.500 --> 14:25.766
Dr. Naadiah:
1998. Summer.

14:25.766 --> 14:27.200
Erica:
Great! That's good.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.666
Dr. Naadiah, I told you,
that I quit. I am done!

14:29.666 --> 14:31.300
No, Erica,
you are not done.

14:31.300 --> 14:34.100
Hey, did you really think
that's all there was to this?

14:34.100 --> 14:35.500
That for everything
you've been given,

14:35.500 --> 14:37.433
you wouldn't have to give
something back?

14:37.433 --> 14:40.433
Okay, fine.
What do I have to do?

14:41.433 --> 14:43.066
You were helped.

14:43.066 --> 14:45.366
Now you have to help
someone else in return.

14:45.366 --> 14:47.266
Who am I supposed to help?

14:47.266 --> 14:48.466
Who indeed?

14:49.600 --> 14:50.600
Dr. Naadiah:
Girls.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.066
(woman giggles)

14:57.166 --> 14:59.700
Erica: Are you sure you want
a harvey wallbanger?

14:59.700 --> 15:01.600
Really?
You couldn't just have,

15:01.600 --> 15:04.233
like, I don't know,
a beer?

15:04.233 --> 15:05.533
Right. Okay.

15:07.433 --> 15:11.166
If I remember correctly
we need some--

15:11.166 --> 15:15.166
Vodka,
some orange juice,

15:16.566 --> 15:19.366
and is it galliano,
or--

15:23.100 --> 15:24.166
Woman: Hello?

15:28.033 --> 15:29.400
(liquor sloshes)

15:29.400 --> 15:30.600
There you go.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.000
One harvey wallbanger.
On the house.

15:32.000 --> 15:32.633
Hey.

15:32.633 --> 15:33.633
Lulu.

15:33.633 --> 15:34.666
That customer
that you just served.

15:34.666 --> 15:36.500
Did he, uh,
did he say anything?

15:36.500 --> 15:37.700
Anything like what?

15:37.700 --> 15:38.600
Like, anything?

15:38.600 --> 15:40.166
Like did
he ask about me?

15:40.166 --> 15:42.566
Or did he tell you something
that I should know?

15:42.566 --> 15:44.200
No.
Unless you need to know

15:44.200 --> 15:47.366
that he drinks
really expensive scotch.

15:47.366 --> 15:48.433
You hit your head?

15:48.433 --> 15:50.733
You're acting like
you hit your head.

15:50.733 --> 15:52.000
(sighs)

15:53.600 --> 15:55.766
Yeah, take a break,
it's cool.

15:55.766 --> 15:57.033
Erica:
Sorry.

16:03.433 --> 16:04.600
Dr. Tom?

16:08.400 --> 16:09.066
Hi.

16:09.066 --> 16:09.766
Hi.

16:09.766 --> 16:11.266
Erica: Look, I'm glad
I found you.

16:11.266 --> 16:13.533
I know that you said
that you didn't wanna see me,

16:13.533 --> 16:14.533
but, Dr. Tom...

16:14.533 --> 16:16.600
Whoa, whoa,
Uh--

16:17.566 --> 16:20.766
My name's Tom,
I'm not a doctor.

16:20.766 --> 16:22.400
What's that
supposed to be?

16:22.400 --> 16:25.566
Some kind of flattering
honorific?

16:25.566 --> 16:27.533
Like a chief or sir.

16:29.766 --> 16:33.133
Well gee, I kinda
like "Chief Tom".

16:33.133 --> 16:35.466
It's got a ring to it.

16:36.733 --> 16:39.400
Why yes,
I'd love another drink,

16:39.400 --> 16:40.633
miss uh--?

16:40.633 --> 16:42.433
Sorry,
you have to help me out.

16:42.433 --> 16:44.000
You're not wearing
your little name tag there.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Eri...

16:50.200 --> 16:53.200
Erica Strange

16:53.400 --> 16:54.500
(chuckles to himself)

16:54.500 --> 16:56.400
Interesting surname.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.566
Thank you.
Uh--

16:58.566 --> 17:01.000
So, Tom,
is that all you go by?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.366
Just Tom.
Like Cher?

17:03.366 --> 17:04.366
(half laughs awkwardly)

17:06.533 --> 17:11.166
Why don't you go and order me
that other highland, neat.

17:11.166 --> 17:12.633
Oh jesus.

17:12.633 --> 17:14.766
Please, really.

17:14.766 --> 17:18.099
I'm flattered,
but, uh--

17:18.099 --> 17:20.599
You know, if you're looking
for a "daddy" type, or--

17:20.599 --> 17:23.266
Oh god no!
No, no, no.

17:23.266 --> 17:24.266
I'm just, um--

17:24.266 --> 17:25.599

17:25.599 --> 17:30.400
Ah, no, I'm just providing
superior customer service.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.333
Okay. Well, good.

17:34.633 --> 17:36.466
'Cause your barley older
than my daughter.

17:36.466 --> 17:38.666
You have a daughter?

17:38.666 --> 17:40.566
That's interesting
because why?

17:40.566 --> 17:42.366
Just because we might
know each other,

17:42.366 --> 17:43.600
if we're the same age.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.000
But what's her name?

17:46.000 --> 17:49.466
I would really like
that drink, Erica.

17:50.466 --> 17:51.666
Sure. Sure.

17:53.433 --> 17:54.700
Sorry if I was prying.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.000
You were prying.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.166
Usually customers,
they wanna to talk.

17:58.166 --> 18:01.700
Oh yeah? Oh, I figured
they came here for the view.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.433
Well, there is always that.

18:03.433 --> 18:05.100
Shaking everything
god gave you for--

18:05.100 --> 18:07.466
For what?
Some tips, I guess.

18:07.466 --> 18:09.366
For tips,
for grad school.

18:09.366 --> 18:12.033
Ah, well, beauty
and brains.

18:12.033 --> 18:14.100
Well, you're the complete
package then, are ya?

18:14.100 --> 18:15.500
Yep, with my masters
in English,

18:15.500 --> 18:17.700
I will be the most well-read
customer service rep

18:17.700 --> 18:19.700
you will ever meet.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.700

Well, time to go
strut my stuff,

18:41.433 --> 18:43.600
but um,
I'll be back.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.633
So, don't go
anywhere, okay?

18:45.633 --> 18:47.000
Promise?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.566
As long as you promise
to bring me the scotch.

18:49.566 --> 18:50.633
How about a coffee?

18:50.633 --> 18:52.633
How about I move my party
next door?

18:52.633 --> 18:56.566
I'll make it a double.
Just stay. please.

19:19.566 --> 19:28.566
♪

19:32.066 --> 19:33.733
(wild shouts of excitement)

19:33.733 --> 19:40.133
♪

19:43.500 --> 19:44.433
Oh, she's back.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.566
I am. and--

19:46.566 --> 19:47.700
I'm on my break.

19:47.700 --> 19:49.000
Lucky me.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.600
So, you have me
for a full 15 minutes,

19:51.600 --> 19:53.666
uninterrupted, Dr--

19:53.666 --> 19:55.633
Sir-Chief Tom.

19:55.633 --> 19:57.100
Just-just Tom.

19:57.100 --> 19:59.533
(awkward laugh)

19:59.533 --> 20:01.066
(clears throat)

20:01.066 --> 20:02.300
Cheers.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.400
So, does your wife mind
you spending all night

20:10.400 --> 20:12.100
alone in a bar?

20:12.100 --> 20:13.366
Do I look married?

20:13.366 --> 20:15.333
I just assumed 'cause you
have a daughter that--

20:15.333 --> 20:18.166
You don't need to have
a wife to have a daughter.

20:18.166 --> 20:19.566
That's not really answering
my question.

20:19.566 --> 20:21.633
My daughter has a mother.

20:21.633 --> 20:23.133
So leave it at that.

20:23.133 --> 20:26.066
You know, maybe you take
a little time in the hot seat.

20:26.066 --> 20:27.666
How about that?

20:27.666 --> 20:31.200
Sure. Ask me anything
you want to.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.533
Your parents mind you
working at a bar like this?

20:36.533 --> 20:38.333
It-it's not like
I'm stripping.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.400
Listen, you say you need
the money

20:40.400 --> 20:41.600
and that's okay,

20:41.600 --> 20:43.700
but you could make money
in a million other ways.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.633
I wouldn't let you
work here.

20:47.666 --> 20:49.666
Well, then I guess
it's a good thing

20:49.666 --> 20:51.500
that you're not my dad.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.300
I'm just saying,
there are other ways,

20:53.300 --> 20:55.500
a million other ways
that you could make money

20:55.500 --> 20:58.000
that don't involve teasing
horny frat boys.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.600
Well, you're here,

20:59.600 --> 21:05.100
so what does that say
about you?

21:05.100 --> 21:07.100
Take this, all right?
Keep all of it.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.000
Whoa!

21:08.000 --> 21:09.500
It's for the drinks
and your, uh, your tip.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.200
Tom.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.300
No, please, really.

21:11.300 --> 21:12.633
And you know what?
Quit this job, Erica.

21:12.633 --> 21:13.766
Find yourself another job.

21:13.766 --> 21:15.666
There's a million other
things you could do.

21:15.666 --> 21:17.000
Please. okay?
Take it.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.600
I can't,
that's a lot of money.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.100
Yeah, you can.

21:20.100 --> 21:22.400
You need it more than I do.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.200
Jock: Hey,
nice dancing.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.366
Oh. thank you.

21:26.066 --> 21:28.100
So, uh, what're you doing
after your shift?

21:28.100 --> 21:30.100
You know, I, um,
I already have plans

21:30.100 --> 21:31.700
and they involve
a lot of sleep.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.100
Well, I like to sleep.

21:33.100 --> 21:34.500
So, uh, what do you say?

21:34.500 --> 21:36.300
I think she said
she's not interested.

21:36.300 --> 21:37.700
That was
pretty clear to me.

21:37.700 --> 21:38.700
All right, dude,
chill.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.000
Nobody's trying
to cock-block you.

21:40.000 --> 21:40.533
Hey.

21:40.533 --> 21:41.733
Tom: I'm sorry?

21:41.733 --> 21:42.733
What did you say?

21:42.733 --> 21:44.366
Look, Dr. Tom,
it's fine, really.

21:44.366 --> 21:45.700
Jock: Listen,
unlike you,

21:45.700 --> 21:48.166
I don't need to pay for a little
somethin'-somethin'.

21:48.166 --> 21:49.100
Hey.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.300
You think that's funny,

21:50.300 --> 21:52.533
talking to a woman like
she's a piece of meat?

21:52.533 --> 21:53.733
All right,
back off, man.

21:53.733 --> 21:55.200
What's the matter, son?

21:55.200 --> 21:57.133
Your father not teach you
how to respect women?

21:57.133 --> 21:58.133
Erica: Hey, hey!
Hey!

21:58.133 --> 21:59.000
Huh?

21:59.000 --> 22:00.133
I'm not gonna hit
an old man.

22:00.133 --> 22:01.400
Oh, well, good for you.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.133
(pained grunt)

22:02.133 --> 22:02.700
Erica: Hey!

22:03.533 --> 22:04.633
Tom!

22:06.633 --> 22:09.700
(fighting grunts,
laboured breathing)

22:10.266 --> 22:11.566
Erica:
Stop it!

22:11.566 --> 22:12.700
Tom!

22:12.700 --> 22:16.133
(struggling grunts
and laboured breaths)

22:17.000 --> 22:18.266
Erica:
Stop it!

22:20.200 --> 22:22.733
(Tom grunts,
jock grunts in pain)

22:25.466 --> 22:27.566
Tom:
Let go of me!

22:27.566 --> 22:28.566
Get off of me!

22:28.566 --> 22:30.166
Let go of him!

22:31.166 --> 22:32.566
(struggling grunts)

22:32.566 --> 22:34.366
Erica:
Hey!

22:34.366 --> 22:35.500
Oh my god!

22:35.500 --> 22:36.600
Stay away!

22:36.600 --> 22:39.433
Get back in there!
Leave me alone!

22:43.300 --> 22:44.433
(rock music plays)

22:45.433 --> 22:47.300
Oh my god.
Julianne?

22:49.700 --> 22:51.333
Wooooo!

22:51.333 --> 22:54.200
(scream and holler)

22:58.733 --> 23:00.200
(clears throat)

23:02.333 --> 23:05.466
Girls, take my winnings,
go get us another round.

23:07.600 --> 23:11.233
So, I found him,
the guy I'm supposed to help.

23:11.233 --> 23:12.533
And?

23:12.533 --> 23:15.166
I don't know how to help him,
I don't--

23:15.166 --> 23:18.266
I don't have the training,
I am not a therapist.

23:18.266 --> 23:20.433
And by therapist,
I mean a real therapist.

23:20.433 --> 23:22.466
But somebody does help him
because Dr. Tom...

23:22.466 --> 23:25.133
He's not like that
in the present.

23:25.133 --> 23:26.733
Or maybe he is.
I don't know.

23:26.733 --> 23:28.566
I mean, I--

23:28.566 --> 23:30.766
I swear, he enjoyed hurting
that guy just now.

23:30.766 --> 23:32.566
I could see it
in his eyes.

23:32.566 --> 23:34.766
'cause it's the same way
he looked at me

23:34.766 --> 23:36.433
when he, you know.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.033
Erica.

23:40.033 --> 23:41.566
Look, I can't help him.
I don't even--

23:41.566 --> 23:44.166
I don't even know how
to begin to help him.

23:44.166 --> 23:46.233
You haven't tried
very hard.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.233
Do you think Dr. Tom

23:48.233 --> 23:50.500
always knew exactly
how to help you?

23:50.500 --> 23:53.333
Like I said,
I am not a therapist.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.300
No.

23:56.300 --> 23:58.300
But you are resourceful.

23:59.300 --> 24:01.466
You'll think of something.

24:01.466 --> 24:02.600
Julianne:
Woooo!

24:05.000 --> 24:05.666
Oh.

24:05.666 --> 24:07.000
Dr. Tom:
You had no right.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.266
Dr. Naadiah:
I'm sorry?

24:08.266 --> 24:11.000
Dr. Tom: You and I both know
that this is not a--

24:11.000 --> 24:12.333
Let me finish.

24:12.333 --> 24:14.366
You walked away from your
responsibilities to Erica.

24:14.366 --> 24:16.166
Her therapy
is no longer your call,

24:16.166 --> 24:17.766
and it is definitely
not your business.

24:17.766 --> 24:20.300
You have taken her
into my past.

24:20.300 --> 24:22.566
I think that makes it
my business.

24:22.566 --> 24:23.600
What do you care?

24:23.600 --> 24:24.633
What do I care?

24:24.633 --> 24:26.033
You said you were done.

24:26.033 --> 24:27.666
Why do you care
what Erica knows

24:27.666 --> 24:29.033
or doesn't know?

24:29.033 --> 24:31.700
Why are you paying
any attention to her at all?

24:38.133 --> 24:39.666
(keyboard keys clack)

24:49.666 --> 24:52.333
(mouse dial scrolls,
mouse button clicks)

24:52.333 --> 24:53.466
Ugh, hurry up.

25:08.466 --> 25:10.000
(traffic rumbles)

25:10.000 --> 25:11.766
Erica: Look, it's really
important that I speak with him.

25:11.766 --> 25:14.366
If you leave a note,
I'll try to forward it.

25:14.366 --> 25:16.000
That's the best
I can do.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.733
Excuse me,

25:19.733 --> 25:22.166
I was wondering
if you could help me?

25:22.166 --> 25:23.700
I'm looking for Tom Wexlar.

25:23.700 --> 25:25.300
And you are?

25:25.300 --> 25:28.000
I'm a friend of his,
um, of his daughter's.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.366
Of Sarah's?!

25:29.366 --> 25:31.466
Do you know
where she is?

25:31.466 --> 25:34.233
You know, it's been a while
since we've hung out.

25:34.233 --> 25:35.333
Well, you tell her

25:35.333 --> 25:38.333
that she should be
ashamed of herself.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.333
Uh, listen, you know,
I'm just looking for her dad.

25:41.333 --> 25:42.100
Why?

25:42.100 --> 25:43.000
Because.

25:43.000 --> 25:43.500
Because, why?

25:43.500 --> 25:46.166
Uh,
It's a long story.

25:46.166 --> 25:47.433
Oh, yes,
I'm sure it is.

25:47.433 --> 25:49.200
And I wouldn't be surprised
if at the end of it,

25:49.200 --> 25:50.433
you show up
with your hand out.

25:50.433 --> 25:51.200
What?! No.

25:51.200 --> 25:54.200
Listen, I think you
should get going.

25:54.200 --> 25:55.200
I'm serious.

26:04.533 --> 26:06.466
(elevator dings open)

26:07.466 --> 26:09.300
Dr. Naadiah,
before you say anything,

26:09.300 --> 26:10.200
I have tried,

26:10.200 --> 26:11.400
and I can't find him,

26:11.400 --> 26:15.033
so, if I can't find him
then I can't help him.

26:15.033 --> 26:17.266
I don't know anything
about him.

26:17.266 --> 26:18.700
That's not true.

26:18.700 --> 26:22.200
You know a lot more about him
than you did even a day ago.

26:22.200 --> 26:24.233
He has anger management
problems.

26:24.233 --> 26:25.266
What else?

26:25.266 --> 26:26.266
(sighs)

26:27.666 --> 26:29.266
His last name
is Wexlar.

26:29.266 --> 26:31.600
He has a daughter
named Sarah,

26:31.600 --> 26:34.200
who should be ashamed
of herself, apparently.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.666
He was fired from his job,

26:35.666 --> 26:37.700
one that, presumably,
paid really well.

26:37.700 --> 26:38.666
And--

26:38.666 --> 26:43.033
(takes deep breath)

26:43.033 --> 26:44.100
He's like me.

26:45.500 --> 26:46.633
How do you mean?

26:48.633 --> 26:51.166
That first day
when he found me,

26:51.166 --> 26:53.100
my life was a disaster.

26:53.566 --> 26:56.400
But that man that I met
in the bar last night,

26:56.400 --> 26:58.600
He's-he's
hit rock bottom.

27:04.233 --> 27:07.300
Dr. Tom was a patient too,
wasn't he?

27:11.566 --> 27:12.633
Come with me.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.566
Where are we going?

27:18.566 --> 27:21.000
To see Tom.
He's over there.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.633
If you could
take me to him,

27:22.633 --> 27:25.266
what was the point of me
running around the city

27:25.266 --> 27:26.600
looking for him?

27:27.466 --> 27:29.200
Dr. Naadiah:
Context.

27:31.700 --> 27:33.700
Erica:
Context for what?

27:34.566 --> 27:37.166
For what you're
about to see.

27:58.633 --> 28:00.000
Oh, jesus.

28:04.200 --> 28:08.033
Dr. Tom: Erica, stop.
I want you to stop.

28:08.033 --> 28:09.100
Uh--

28:18.066 --> 28:18.700
Dr. Tom?

28:18.700 --> 28:20.233
This is not your problem.

28:20.233 --> 28:23.266
Naadiah's my therapist now
and she seems to think it is.

28:23.266 --> 28:26.366
Please,
just leave it alone.

28:26.366 --> 28:29.033
I don't want you
to talk to him.

28:30.300 --> 28:33.733
I have told you
everything about me,

28:33.733 --> 28:36.000
exposed myself in ways--

28:37.766 --> 28:39.700
I-I don't get it.

28:40.533 --> 28:43.333
I don't get how you,
the Dr. Tom that I know,

28:43.333 --> 28:45.033
could ever be him.

28:45.033 --> 28:46.066
And I don't care.

28:46.066 --> 28:48.133
My purpose here
is to help that man

28:48.133 --> 28:50.166
that looks like
he's about to throw himself

28:50.166 --> 28:51.566
off this building.

28:52.566 --> 28:53.766
You can't help him.

28:54.766 --> 28:57.600
Maybe,
but I'm gonna try.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.566
(gravel crunches underfoot)

29:06.133 --> 29:07.133
Erica:
Tom?

29:09.766 --> 29:12.300
What are you--?
How'd you get up here?

29:12.300 --> 29:13.533
How did you find me?

29:13.533 --> 29:14.533
It doesn't matter.

29:14.533 --> 29:16.566
Tom:
Yes, it does.

29:16.566 --> 29:18.400
What the hell
is going on here?

29:18.400 --> 29:19.733
Who are you?!

29:19.733 --> 29:23.433
Just think of me as a-
as a guardian angel type.

29:23.433 --> 29:24.433
Tom:
Oh yeah?

29:25.700 --> 29:27.533
Where you been?

29:27.533 --> 29:29.166
(derisive chuckle)

29:29.166 --> 29:30.766
Huh?

29:30.766 --> 29:33.000
Well, where the hell
have you been

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
the last couple of years?!

29:35.000 --> 29:36.200
Why am I up here?

29:39.600 --> 29:43.533
"In the middle of difficulty
lies opportunity."

29:45.366 --> 29:46.733
That's Albert Einstein.

29:46.733 --> 29:48.566
Yeah.

29:48.566 --> 29:50.566
That's a quote that I--

29:52.266 --> 29:55.200
Who are you?
Why did you say that?

29:55.200 --> 29:59.533
Because it always reminds me
that there's a way out.

30:01.066 --> 30:02.466
I don't think so.

30:04.200 --> 30:05.200
Not for me.

30:07.266 --> 30:11.033
I know what that's like,
and that's--

30:11.033 --> 30:14.100
That's sort
of why I'm here.

30:14.100 --> 30:16.733
Look--

30:16.733 --> 30:18.400
Don't do it, please.

30:20.133 --> 30:23.133
It's not gonna make
anything better.

30:24.133 --> 30:25.600
I can't live like this
anymore.

30:29.433 --> 30:30.733
I'm done.

30:30.733 --> 30:32.633
(crying)

30:32.633 --> 30:35.066
if there's an opportunity
in the middle of this,

30:35.066 --> 30:36.333
I don't see it.

30:42.633 --> 30:43.633
It's me.

30:47.533 --> 30:49.266
I'm your opportunity.

30:53.166 --> 30:55.166
Come on.
Let's go, okay?

30:57.066 --> 30:58.266
Let's find a better way

30:58.266 --> 31:00.366
to fix whatever it is
that's wrong.

31:01.366 --> 31:02.433
Ethan:
Erica?

31:03.500 --> 31:04.300
(shrieking)

31:04.300 --> 31:07.600
Dr. Tom, no!

31:07.600 --> 31:09.733
Hey, are you okay?

31:09.733 --> 31:13.033
Your doctor,
what did she want?

31:13.033 --> 31:14.566
She uh, nothing.

31:14.566 --> 31:16.633
Well, how did she know
you were here?

31:16.633 --> 31:20.000
Um, I don't know,
maybe Meeri told her?

31:20.000 --> 31:21.733
It's totally nuts,

31:21.733 --> 31:23.733
and I am not answering
my phone anymore.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.333
(computer keys clack)

31:49.100 --> 31:51.266
Erica: "Talked down
from suicide."

31:52.600 --> 31:53.600
What?

31:56.466 --> 31:57.466
(sniffs)

32:00.766 --> 32:01.766
(exhales)

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Okay.

32:45.333 --> 32:48.333
(doorknob clicks,
door creaks open)

33:07.733 --> 33:10.366
(sighs heavily)

33:10.366 --> 33:11.366
Hi.

33:12.500 --> 33:13.500
Hi.

33:19.166 --> 33:21.500
(expels breath slowly)

33:23.033 --> 33:25.166
Uh, did you
wanna sit or--?

33:26.166 --> 33:28.366
I saw you jump.

33:28.366 --> 33:30.300
You're supposed
to be dead.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.366
Yeah well, it's, um--

33:35.766 --> 33:38.600
It is a little more
complicated than that.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.633
But that's not what
I've brought you here

33:40.633 --> 33:42.000
to talk about.

33:44.200 --> 33:45.766
I want, hmm--

33:45.766 --> 33:48.233
I need to
apologize to you,

33:50.133 --> 33:52.200
for the other day here.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.000
For breaking your trust.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.700
You know, for, uh--

33:58.700 --> 34:02.366
Losing it like I did.

34:04.000 --> 34:04.766
For hurting you.

34:04.766 --> 34:05.466
It's okay.

34:05.466 --> 34:07.400
No.

34:07.400 --> 34:08.133
It's not.

34:09.666 --> 34:12.766
And as you now,
it's-it's also, uh,

34:12.766 --> 34:14.366
not the first time.

34:15.666 --> 34:18.000
(inhales deeply
and exhales)

34:26.166 --> 34:32.266
You see,
I thought that I was done.

34:32.266 --> 34:33.666
With all of that.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.166
Obviously not.

34:37.233 --> 34:38.500
And as a result,

34:38.500 --> 34:42.733
I decided that it was not
in your best interest

34:42.733 --> 34:45.333
to continue to have me
as a therapist.

34:47.199 --> 34:49.300
What happened to you?

34:49.300 --> 34:51.633
When I saw you
back in 1998,

34:53.400 --> 34:55.000
you were so different.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.633
So--

34:57.633 --> 34:58.633
Angry.

34:58.633 --> 35:02.033
Yeah, you were
angry and--

35:02.033 --> 35:04.033
Just bitter, sad.

35:06.233 --> 35:09.766
You're so different
from who you are now.

35:09.766 --> 35:10.766
Why?

35:11.166 --> 35:20.166
♪

35:24.133 --> 35:25.133
(gasps)

35:26.266 --> 35:29.066
(car horn blasts,
traffic rumbles)

35:29.566 --> 35:32.233
Where are we? I mean,
I know where we are.

35:32.233 --> 35:33.366
1996.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.633
I wanna show you
something.

35:41.066 --> 35:43.133
That girl
is my daughter.

35:46.100 --> 35:47.033
Sarah.

35:47.033 --> 35:49.600
Sarah.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.600
Dr. Tom:
When Sarah was young,

35:51.600 --> 35:54.533
Uh, the two of us
were inseparable.

35:56.133 --> 35:58.333
But then things between
her mother and I

35:58.333 --> 36:01.366
got complicated and I--

36:01.366 --> 36:04.066
I said things
and I did things

36:05.166 --> 36:07.466
that I couldn't unsay,

36:08.466 --> 36:10.133
and that I couldn't undo.

36:10.133 --> 36:12.166
After a while,
Sarah stopped coming home.

36:12.166 --> 36:14.566
But I always knew that
I could find her here.

36:14.566 --> 36:16.566
Sarah: Oh my god!
What're you doing here?

36:16.566 --> 36:18.766
Please, come on down,
I wanna talk to you.

36:18.766 --> 36:20.066
Well, I'm busy.

36:20.066 --> 36:21.666
Tom: Sarah, why won't
you come home?

36:21.666 --> 36:23.466
Sarah: I don't care
what you want!

36:23.466 --> 36:25.100
We had
a fight this day.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.500
Tom: No, I don't want you
to have this life!

36:27.500 --> 36:28.766
This makes me happy!

36:28.766 --> 36:31.166
And it was one of many,
but this day,

36:31.166 --> 36:35.200
I said some things
that I later regretted.

36:35.200 --> 36:36.066
Do you understand!

36:36.066 --> 36:38.033
Don't touch me!

36:38.033 --> 36:39.466
Sarah: Forget it, dad!

36:39.466 --> 36:41.300
I'm never coming home!

36:42.100 --> 36:44.533
Tom: You can't spend
your days out on the street,

36:44.533 --> 36:46.133
that's not
a way to live!

36:46.133 --> 36:47.400
Sarah: Go away!

36:50.300 --> 36:53.100
And this was the last time
that I saw my daughter.

36:53.100 --> 36:55.100
I mean, I didn't know
if she was--

36:55.100 --> 36:57.433
Dead or alive.

36:57.433 --> 36:58.600
I still don't.

36:59.766 --> 37:02.333
And as the weeks went by,
I just got--

37:02.333 --> 37:04.333
I got angrier
and angrier--

37:05.333 --> 37:08.166
So that I could feel
nothing else.

37:09.200 --> 37:12.433
And then one day,
I just decided that--

37:13.033 --> 37:14.266
I was done.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.233
Dr. Tom, you don't have
to explain yourself to me.

37:16.233 --> 37:17.400
No, I do, Erica,

37:17.400 --> 37:19.100
because I need you
to understand

37:19.100 --> 37:22.133
that when you went back
and you saved Leo's life,

37:22.133 --> 37:24.233
you did the one thing
that I wished

37:24.233 --> 37:26.166
that I would've done.

37:26.166 --> 37:28.300
And so, when you saved
your brothers life,

37:28.300 --> 37:32.033
it-it triggered something
inside of me

37:32.033 --> 37:34.766
and all
these old feelings

37:34.766 --> 37:36.000
and these things--

37:36.000 --> 37:38.533
That I thought
that I was done with

37:38.533 --> 37:40.166
just came rushing back

37:40.166 --> 37:43.400
and I couldn't control them
and I couldn't control myself,

37:43.400 --> 37:46.633
and a therapist
can't act like that.

37:46.633 --> 37:51.233
That's why Doctor Naadiah
will be a better fit for you.

37:54.233 --> 37:59.566
Ugh, this therapy,
it has been the craziest,

37:59.566 --> 38:02.433
most intense experience
that I have ever had.

38:02.433 --> 38:04.233
But you don't let me
run away.

38:04.233 --> 38:05.233
You made a commitment.

38:05.233 --> 38:06.600
And so did you.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.266
You promised
that you would help me,

38:10.266 --> 38:11.266
and you did.

38:13.033 --> 38:14.433
Everything that
you just said,

38:14.433 --> 38:17.333
it sounds like
it makes sense,

38:17.333 --> 38:19.233
but I still know
that you quitting,

38:19.233 --> 38:20.433
it's not the right thing.

38:20.433 --> 38:22.033
Erica, I'm not quitting.

38:22.033 --> 38:24.333
I just want you to have
the best therapist, that's all.

38:24.333 --> 38:26.766
And that person is you.

38:26.766 --> 38:30.000
I mean so what
if you're not perfect?

38:30.000 --> 38:32.200
Is that really what this
all comes down to?

38:32.200 --> 38:34.233
You thought that you were done
making mistakes

38:34.233 --> 38:36.066
and being overwhelmed
by the past,

38:36.066 --> 38:38.066
and,
you need to quit?

38:39.733 --> 38:43.466
You thought you were done,
but you were wrong.

38:43.466 --> 38:47.466
I mean when is anybody
ever really done, anyway?

38:47.466 --> 38:49.666
When they're dead maybe?
Or maybe not even then.

38:49.666 --> 38:51.700
And I'm sure a hell
am not done;

38:51.700 --> 38:54.766
I have a list of regrets
a mile long.

38:57.566 --> 39:00.233
But the one regret
I don't have,

39:02.000 --> 39:03.133
Dr. Tom, is you.

39:15.066 --> 39:18.600
"When the student is ready,
the teacher will appear."

39:18.600 --> 39:20.366
Buddhist proverb.

39:21.166 --> 39:22.566
Well, it appears
in this instance

39:22.566 --> 39:24.633
that that teacher is you.

39:24.633 --> 39:26.766
(breathes a sigh of relief)

39:28.433 --> 39:29.700
So we're good then?

39:29.700 --> 39:31.433
We're good.

39:31.433 --> 39:33.433
Okay.

39:34.733 --> 39:37.100
Good, 'cause...
To be honest,

39:38.700 --> 39:40.033
Dr. Naadiah's office?

39:40.033 --> 39:41.700
It's not the warmest place
I've ever been in.

39:41.700 --> 39:43.000
I know.

39:43.000 --> 39:43.566
I mean, come on.

39:43.566 --> 39:44.566
Even like
a throw rug,

39:44.566 --> 39:46.200
or a space heater
would help.

39:46.200 --> 39:47.466
I'll mention it.

39:47.466 --> 39:48.466
Thank you.

39:52.600 --> 39:53.600
Thank you.

39:57.633 --> 39:59.700
So, what are you anyway?

40:17.366 --> 40:18.766
has not yet come.

40:21.100 --> 40:22.100
