WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:03.033
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
LET'S PLAY.

00:03.033 --> 00:04.933
- COME ON, RAY.
TURN OFF THE TV.

00:04.933 --> 00:06.600
- [groans]

00:06.600 --> 00:09.467
- THIS IS WHAT YOU DO NOW, HUH?
YOU PLAY BOARD GAMES.

00:09.467 --> 00:11.133
- I JUST LIKE GAMES
'CAUSE IT'S SOMETHING

00:11.133 --> 00:12.667
WE CAN ALL DO TOGETHER.

00:12.667 --> 00:15.167
- OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
FAMILY FUN.

00:15.167 --> 00:19.800
COME ON,
LET ME KICK YOUR ASS.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.033
- MARIE, COME BACK HERE!

00:21.033 --> 00:22.667
- YOUR FATHER IS IMPOSSIBLE.

00:22.667 --> 00:26.433
- YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE
MY ORANGE JUICE WITH PULP.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.300
- IT SAYS RIGHT HERE,
"NO PULP."

00:32.300 --> 00:36.533
- YOU AND THAT
ARE LIARS.

00:36.533 --> 00:40.267
- I'LL GIVE YOU BOTH 100,000
IF YOU GO HOME RIGHT NOW.

00:42.467 --> 00:44.567
- THE CARIBOU LODGE
IS CLOSED TODAY.

00:44.567 --> 00:46.067
SO HE'S HANGING AROUND
THE HOUSE,

00:46.067 --> 00:47.500
AND HE'S MAKING ME
MISERABLE.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.733
- YOU AIN'T DOING THAT MUCH
FOR ME EITHER.

00:50.733 --> 00:52.500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THE LODGE IS CLOSED?

00:52.500 --> 00:54.167
- WE'RE HAVING
SOME FINANCIAL TROUBLE

00:54.167 --> 00:57.333
DUE TO A RECENT THINNING
OF THE HERD.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.067
- THINNING OF THE HERD?

01:00.067 --> 01:03.800
- THE OLD MEN ARE DYING.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.967
- YEAH, WE'RE DOWN
TO FOUR DAYS A WEEK NOW.

01:05.967 --> 01:09.567
IF THINGS KEEP GOING THIS WAY,
WE MAY HAVE TO CLOSE ALTOGETHER.

01:09.567 --> 01:13.000
- OH, GOD, NO!

01:13.000 --> 01:14.567
- YOU GUYS
NEED SOME NEW BLOOD?

01:14.567 --> 01:17.600
- BLOOD, HIPS, HAIR--
WHATEVER YOU GOT.

01:19.900 --> 01:21.100
- YOU KNOW, FRANK,

01:21.100 --> 01:22.400
I KNOW THAT, UP TILL NOW,

01:22.400 --> 01:24.367
THE LODGE HAS BEEN
A MEN'S CLUB,

01:24.367 --> 01:27.200
BUT IF YOU WERE
TO CONSIDER...

01:27.200 --> 01:31.800
- FOR...GET...IT.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.033
- YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID
AT MY PARENTS' COUNTRY CLUB?

01:34.033 --> 01:35.500
- I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY WANTS TO HEAR

01:35.500 --> 01:40.133
A FANCY COUNTRY CLUB STORY
RIGHT NOW, DEAR.

01:40.133 --> 01:43.467
- IT'S NOT
A FANCY COUNTRY--

01:43.467 --> 01:48.033
[sighs]
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID?

01:48.033 --> 01:49.900
THEY HAD SPECIAL
RECRUITING EVENTS.

01:49.900 --> 01:51.233
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:51.233 --> 01:53.433
- RECRUITING EVENTS
TO ATTRACT NEW MEMBERS.

01:53.433 --> 01:57.467
THEY HAD A WINE TASTING,
A CASINO NIGHT, A LUAU.

01:57.467 --> 02:00.267
- OR YOU COULD RAID
A NURSING HOME.

02:06.567 --> 02:08.233
- SINCE THIS
IS A MEN'S CLUB,

02:08.233 --> 02:13.233
YOU COULD HAVE
A MANLY, FOOTBALL-WATCHING,

02:13.233 --> 02:16.100
MEAT-EATING PARTY.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.567
- I LIKE FOOTBALL.

02:18.567 --> 02:21.233
I LOVE MEAT.

02:21.233 --> 02:23.033
BUT WE CAN'T.
- WHY NOT?

02:23.033 --> 02:25.533
- WELL, O'NEAL USED TO HANDLE
ALL THAT PARTY CRAP,

02:25.533 --> 02:29.700
AND HE WAS PART
OF THE THINNING.

02:29.700 --> 02:32.900
- WELL, I MEAN,
YOU COULD DO THIS, FRANK.

02:32.900 --> 02:34.367
ALL IT IS IS A PARTY

02:34.367 --> 02:36.400
AND THEN SOME FOLLOW-UP
PHONE CALLS TO THE GUESTS.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.067
WHEN I WAS IN PR,
I USED TO DO IT ALL THE TIME.

02:39.067 --> 02:40.500
- WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD
DO IT AGAIN.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.600
- ME?
- WE'LL PAY YOU.

02:42.600 --> 02:45.633
- I'LL PAY YOU.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.067
- I MEAN,
SHE'S NOT GOING TO DO THAT.

02:49.067 --> 02:50.600
- WHA--

02:50.600 --> 02:52.033
EXCUSE ME.

02:52.033 --> 02:55.200
I MIGHT WANT TO HELP THEM.
I HAVE THE TIME.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.667
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:56.667 --> 02:58.533
YOU'VE GOT PLENTY
TO DO AROUND HERE, RIGHT?

02:58.533 --> 03:01.433
I MEAN, THE PLACE
IS ALL MESSY AND...

03:01.433 --> 03:04.800
AND...

03:04.800 --> 03:07.500
TAKE IT, MA.

03:07.500 --> 03:10.667
- DEBRA IS
A WONDERFUL HOUSEKEEPER.

03:13.333 --> 03:16.467
GET TO THE LODGE.

03:21.733 --> 03:23.467
- HEY, DEBRA'S HERE!

03:23.467 --> 03:26.100
[laughs]

03:26.100 --> 03:28.100
- THANKS, GARVIN.
HOW YOU BOYS DOING?

03:28.100 --> 03:29.467
- WE'RE TERRIFIC.

03:29.467 --> 03:31.667
HOW'S OUR FAVORITE
BUSY BEE?

03:31.667 --> 03:33.033
- OH, GREAT.

03:33.033 --> 03:34.767
I'VE GOT ALL YOUR MEMBERSHIP
RECORDS TOGETHER HERE,

03:34.767 --> 03:36.400
AND TOMORROW, I'M GOING
TO PUT THEM ON THE COMPUTER.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.467
all: OH!

03:39.467 --> 03:41.300
- DIDN'T I TELL YOU,
FELLAS?

03:41.300 --> 03:44.733
O'NEAL COULDN'T DO THAT
EVEN WHEN HE WAS ALIVE.

03:44.733 --> 03:46.300
- DEBBIE, YOU'VE BEEN WORKING
ALL WEEK.

03:46.300 --> 03:48.100
WHY DON'T YOU PUNCH OUT
FOR THE DAY?

03:48.100 --> 03:49.767
- YEAH.

03:49.767 --> 03:50.800
I'M BUYING.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.200

03:52.200 --> 03:55.900
WOW, DEBRA, YOU'RE HERE
ON A HISTORIC OCCASION.

03:55.900 --> 03:59.200
- I'M NOT BUYING FOR YOU.
I'M BUYING FOR DEBRA.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.467
- COME ON, DEBRA.

04:00.467 --> 04:02.500
GET OVER HERE
TO THE WATERING HOLE.

04:02.500 --> 04:05.300
- WATERING HOLE
BECAUSE WE'RE CARIBOU.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.933
- ALL RIGHT, FELLAS.

04:07.933 --> 04:10.033
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:10.033 --> 04:11.600
THANK YOU.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.500
I'VE GOTTEN A GREAT RESPONSE
TO THE FOOTBALL PARTY.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.533
- YOU MUST'VE PUT YOUR PICTURE
ON THE INVITATION.

04:16.533 --> 04:18.833
- AW, ALBERT!

04:18.833 --> 04:22.167
- HEY, DEBRA, I WAS THINKING
OF ANOTHER FUND-RAISING IDEA.

04:22.167 --> 04:24.133
THE CARIBOU FOLLIES.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.100
- OH, YEAH?
- OH, YEAH.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.267
BACK IN THE SERVICE,

WE USED TO PUT ON SHOWS,
YOU KNOW,

04:28.733 --> 04:32.067
WHERE WE DRESS UP LIKE BROADS
AND DANCE AROUND.

04:32.067 --> 04:36.733
- SOME OF US STILL DO.

04:36.733 --> 04:39.100
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE
COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT

04:39.100 --> 04:40.600
WITHOUT
THE DRESSING UP PART.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.200
- MM, IF YOU GUYS WANT TO HAVE
AN EVENT LIKE THAT,

04:43.200 --> 04:45.000
WE COULD DO IT RIGHT HERE.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.567

- MM.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.833
I UNDERSTAND.

07:22.833 --> 07:27.667
IT'S GOT TO BE EXHAUSTING
ENTERTAINING THE TROOPS...

07:27.667 --> 07:30.467
FROM THE CIVIL WAR.

07:30.467 --> 07:33.700

08:23.467 --> 08:24.733
IT'S VERY NICE
HAVING SOMEBODY

08:24.733 --> 08:27.467

THEY'RE COMPLETELY GRATEFUL

08:37.400 --> 08:39.133

THEY'RE PROBABLY
SITTING IN FRONT OF IT,

10:02.267 --> 10:05.467
WAITING FOR "MANNIX"

10:15.600 --> 10:17.300
[groans]

10:17.300 --> 10:19.700
[video game laser blasts]

10:19.700 --> 10:22.467
- HELLO, RAYMOND, DEAR.
DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT?

10:22.467 --> 10:25.867
- NOT REALLY.
I'M KIND OF SWAMPED.

10:25.867 --> 10:29.267
- THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.

10:29.267 --> 10:30.667
- HELLO, RAYMOND.
- HI.

10:30.667 --> 10:33.300
HI, HILDA.
MS. PECHI, MS. LOPMAN.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.600
- HELLO, RAYMOND.
- IS DEBRA HOME?

10:35.600 --> 10:38.167
- I SAID I'D HANDLE THIS,
HILDA.

10:38.167 --> 10:40.400
RAYMOND,
IS DEBRA AROUND?

10:40.400 --> 10:42.167
WE NEED TO TALK WITH HER.

10:42.167 --> 10:44.800
- ACTUALLY, SHE JUST
WENT DOWN TO THE LODGE.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.633
- OH!
- AGAIN?

10:46.633 --> 10:49.700
- WHAT?

10:49.700 --> 10:50.900
WH-WHAT'S THE MATTER?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.133
- I HAVE TO TELL YOU

10:52.133 --> 10:53.800
THAT WE FIND
THIS WHOLE SITUATION

10:53.800 --> 10:55.400
A LITTLE TROUBLING.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.167
- WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

10:57.167 --> 10:58.633
YOU WERE ALL
FOR THIS SITUATION.

10:58.633 --> 11:02.233
- YOUR WIFE
IS OUT OF CONTROL.

11:03.567 --> 11:05.100
- HILDA.

11:05.100 --> 11:07.967
RAYMOND, I THINK YOU SHOULD
SUGGEST TO DEBRA

11:07.967 --> 11:10.867
THAT SHE DOESN'T NEED
TO GO TO THE LODGE ANYMORE.

11:10.867 --> 11:12.733
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MA?
SHE'S DOING GREAT,

11:12.733 --> 11:14.633
AND THE GUYS LOVE HER
DOWN THERE.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.867
- OF COURSE THEY DO!
- SURE, THEY DO.

11:17.867 --> 11:21.167
- THERE'S SOMETHING
QUITE INAPPROPRIATE

11:21.167 --> 11:22.700
ABOUT A GIRL LIKE HER

11:22.700 --> 11:25.400
PARADING AROUND IN FRONT
OF A GROUP OF MEN.

11:27.167 --> 11:30.733
- IT'S SHAMEFUL.

11:30.733 --> 11:34.033
- HILDA, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD WAIT IN THE CAR.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.600
- MA, DEBRA LIKES HER JOB,

11:39.600 --> 11:41.867
AND SHE SAID
IT'S BEEN GOOD FOR HER.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.467
- IT'S NOT RIGHT.

11:43.467 --> 11:46.167
DEBRA'S HAVING
AN INFLUENCE ON THE MEN.

11:46.167 --> 11:48.533
- ALBERT COMES HOME,
AND ALL I HEAR IS,

11:48.533 --> 11:51.333
"WHY CAN'T YOU FIX YOURSELF UP
LIKE DEBRA?"

11:51.333 --> 11:54.800
I CAN'T COMPETE WITH THAT.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.333
DEBRA'S UNDER 60.

11:59.833 --> 12:01.267
- THAT'S RIGHT.

12:01.267 --> 12:04.067
SUDDENLY, MY ARTIE
HAS ALL THIS PENT-UP ENERGY.

12:04.067 --> 12:05.433
WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.333
HE'S PINCHING,
MAKING KISSING NOISES.

12:07.333 --> 12:10.033
I CAN'T GET MIXED UP
IN THAT NONSENSE.

12:10.033 --> 12:13.600
- OKAY, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.633
- RAYMOND, YOU KNOW
THAT I LOVE DEBRA.

12:15.633 --> 12:17.033
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

12:17.033 --> 12:19.700
AROUND MEN,
SHE HAS AN AIR.

12:22.133 --> 12:23.533
- AN AIR?

12:23.533 --> 12:26.967
- YOU KNOW...

12:26.967 --> 12:30.200
- ALL RIGHT!

12:32.033 --> 12:35.333
FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

12:35.333 --> 12:38.500
SECOND OF ALL,
DON'T DO THAT.

12:42.033 --> 12:44.800
- HEY, RAY.
OH, HEY.

12:44.800 --> 12:48.700
- SHOULDN'T YOU BE AT THE LODGE
WITH THE REST OF THEM?

12:48.700 --> 12:50.800
- WHAT'S WITH YOU?

12:50.800 --> 12:52.933
- MOM'S BRIDGE CLUB
APPARENTLY IS A LITTLE UPSET

12:52.933 --> 12:54.700
OVER DEBRA
WORKING FOR YOU GUYS.

12:54.700 --> 12:57.067
- SHE'S A FLOOZY.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.733
- AW, COME ON.

12:58.733 --> 13:00.733
SHE JUST DOES
SOME PAPERWORK FOR US.

13:00.733 --> 13:04.600
- WELL, SHE'S GOT MY JOE
GOBBLING HEART PILLS.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.567
- YOUR HUSBAND'S
GOBBLING HEART PILLS

13:06.567 --> 13:09.733
BECAUSE HE'S HAD A 50-YEAR
LOVE AFFAIR WITH HAM.

13:15.067 --> 13:16.867
- SO HOW COME,
THIS WEEK,

13:16.867 --> 13:20.333
ARTIE USED UP
A FULL BOTTLE OF AQUA VELVA?

13:20.333 --> 13:24.867
- BECAUSE WE COULDN'T GET HIM
TO USE TWO BOTTLES.

13:24.867 --> 13:27.267
NO OFFENSE, BUT YOUR HUSBAND
HAS A PROBLEM.

13:27.267 --> 13:30.633
WE CAN SMELL HIM
UNDERWATER.

13:30.633 --> 13:33.467
- I SMELL A COVER-UP.
- YES.

13:33.467 --> 13:36.400
- YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU LADIES
ARE OUT OF YOUR MINDS.

13:36.400 --> 13:40.333
NOW I'M GOING TO WATCH THE
FOOTBALL GAME WITH MY PANTS OFF.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.033
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO. LET'S GO.

13:42.033 --> 13:46.767
RAYMOND, RAYMOND.

13:46.767 --> 13:48.600
RAYMOND, PLEASE.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.133
JUST KEEP AN EYE
ON DEBRA, WILL YOU?

13:50.133 --> 13:51.400
- YEAH, I WILL, MA.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.667
- AND, FRANK,
I JUST WANT TO SAY...

13:52.667 --> 13:56.133
- I'M ABOUT
TO START SCRATCHING.

14:01.433 --> 14:03.400
- OH!
THANKS, DAD.

14:03.400 --> 14:06.267
I WAS NEVER SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU OPEN YOUR PANTS.

14:06.267 --> 14:08.800
- ALL RIGHT, THEY'RE GONE.
LISTEN.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.967
YOU GOT TO MAKE DEBRA QUIT.

14:10.967 --> 14:13.433
- WHAT?
- GET HER OUT OF THERE.

14:13.433 --> 14:14.667
- WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:14.667 --> 14:15.867
YOU JUST SAID
EVERYTHING WAS FINE.

14:15.867 --> 14:18.200
- I LIED.

14:18.200 --> 14:22.733
THE TRUTH IS,
THE GUYS AT THE LODGE ARE...

14:22.733 --> 14:24.700
OGLING YOUR WOMAN.

14:26.800 --> 14:27.967
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:27.967 --> 14:29.167
IS DEBRA
REALLY FLIRTING WITH THEM?

14:29.167 --> 14:30.867
- NO, NO, NO, IT'S NOT HER.

14:30.867 --> 14:32.733
IT'S THE GUYS.

14:32.733 --> 14:34.133
THEY STARE AT HER,

14:34.133 --> 14:36.000
AND THEN THEY EXCHANGE LOOKS
WITH EACH OTHER,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.667
AND THEN,
WHEN SHE LEAVES THE ROOM,

14:38.667 --> 14:42.667
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
THERE'S BEEN SOME...

14:42.667 --> 14:45.600
COMMENTARY.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.967
- OH, MY GOD!

14:47.967 --> 14:49.267
- I KNOW.

14:49.267 --> 14:50.667
I HATE HEARING
THOSE THINGS.

14:50.667 --> 14:52.933
DEBRA'S LIKE
A DAUGHTER TO ME.

14:52.933 --> 14:56.400
AND YET, THESE MEN
ARE MY BROTHERS.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.533
IT'S A PICKLE,
I TELL YA!

15:01.033 --> 15:02.267
- WELL, WHAT DO THEY SAY?

15:02.267 --> 15:03.800
- YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.900
JUST GET HER OUT OF THERE.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.133
- WAIT, WAIT.

15:07.133 --> 15:08.433
WHAT DO THEY SAY?

15:08.433 --> 15:10.133
- I'M NOT ALLOWED,
DON'T YA GET IT?

15:10.133 --> 15:13.267
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU
WHAT GOES ON AT THE LODGE.

15:13.267 --> 15:16.433
IT'S THE CODE
OF THE CARIBOU.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.367
- ALL RIGHT.
LOOK, YOU'RE NUTS, OKAY?

15:20.367 --> 15:23.567
THE WHOLE THING'S PROBABLY
BLOWN WAY OUT OF PROPORTION.

15:29.867 --> 15:36.100
- CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT HER
HAVE BEEN MENTIONED.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.533
- LIKE WHAT?

15:40.533 --> 15:45.700
- HER ANKLES...

15:45.700 --> 15:48.800
HER GAMS.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.167
THAT'S LEGS.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.467
HER, UH...

16:00.633 --> 16:03.533
DERRIERE.

16:03.533 --> 16:04.833
- WHAT?

16:04.833 --> 16:08.100
- DON'T MAKE ME
GO HIGHER.

16:10.667 --> 16:15.133
- WHAT THE HELL
GOES ON DOWN THERE?

16:15.133 --> 16:16.767
- SON, IT'S...

16:16.767 --> 16:21.067
IT'S TIME YOU KNEW SOMETHING
ABOUT THE CARIBOU.

16:21.067 --> 16:24.600
THEY'RE PIGS.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.667
WHERE YOU GOING?

16:25.667 --> 16:27.100
- I'M GOING DOWN
TO THE LODGE, OKAY?

16:27.100 --> 16:28.300
I'M GOING TO TALK
TO YOUR FRIENDS.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.533
- YOU DIDN'T HEAR THIS
FROM ME.

16:30.533 --> 16:32.700
YOU DIDN'T
HEAR THIS FROM ME!

16:37.000 --> 16:38.567
- SO I HAVE ALL THE RSVPs
FOR THE FOOTBALL PARTY ON HERE,

16:39.667 --> 16:41.533
AND THEN, IF YOU DRAG
THIS FILE OVER HERE

16:41.533 --> 16:43.300
AND OPEN IT,
THERE'S THE FOLLIES.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.233
- HEY, THAT REMINDS ME.

16:45.233 --> 16:46.867
WE WERE WORKING
ON A NEW SONG,

16:46.867 --> 16:50.033
AND WE WERE THINKING
WE'D LIKE YOU TO SING IT, DEBRA.

16:50.033 --> 16:53.667
- WHO, ME?
- YEAH!

16:53.667 --> 16:56.933
- WELL, I MEAN, I GUESS I COULD,
IF YOU NEED PERFORMERS.

16:56.933 --> 16:59.133
- COME OVER HERE
TO THE PIANO, DEBRA.

16:59.133 --> 17:00.400
LET'S GIVE IT A WHIRL.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.000
- OKAY.
- HERE YOU GO.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.967
HAL, A LITTLE
"PUT THE BLAME ON MAME."

17:04.967 --> 17:09.367
[upbeat piano music]

17:09.367 --> 17:13.000
- [singing]
PUT THE BLAME ON MAME, BOYS

17:13.000 --> 17:15.333
PUT THE BLAME ON MAME

17:15.333 --> 17:16.933
- HEY, HEY, WAIT!

17:16.933 --> 17:18.500
YOU KNOW
WHAT WOULD BE FUN?

17:18.500 --> 17:20.800
GET UP ON TOP OF THE PIANO
WHERE EVERYBODY CAN SEE YOU.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.167
- NO!
YEAH?

17:22.167 --> 17:24.000
- YEAH!
- OKAY.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
- HURRY UP.
- OKAY.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.067
[piano music starts]

17:28.067 --> 17:31.267
[singing]
PUT THE BLAME ON MAME, BOYS

17:31.267 --> 17:34.333
PUT THE BLAME ON MAME

17:34.333 --> 17:39.433
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH!

17:39.433 --> 17:41.067
- HEY, RAY'S HERE!

17:41.067 --> 17:44.267
- SHUT UP, GARVIN.

17:44.267 --> 17:45.833
- RAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:45.833 --> 17:47.600
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, DEBRA.
COME ON, YOU CAN COME DOWN NOW.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.467
- HEY, WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A REHEARSAL HERE.

17:50.467 --> 17:53.367
- YEAH, WELL,
THE SHOW'S OVER, MAX.

17:55.633 --> 17:59.300
DEBRA, COME DOWN.
I HAVE SOMETHING URGENT.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.800
IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING
TO TELL YOU.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.033
- OKAY.
- HERE YOU GO.

18:03.033 --> 18:04.567
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,
NO TOUCHING!

18:04.567 --> 18:06.833
- RAY, STOP!

18:06.833 --> 18:08.300
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

18:08.300 --> 18:09.600
THEY'RE JUST BEING NICE.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.700
- NO, NO, NO.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.200
I KNOW YOU THINK
BECAUSE THEY'RE OLD,

18:12.200 --> 18:14.567
THEY'RE ALL CUTE
AND SWEET AND GRANDPA-Y.

18:14.567 --> 18:15.567
THEY'RE NOT.

18:15.567 --> 18:16.800
THEY'RE DIRTY,
FILTHY MEN.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.033
- RAY!

18:18.033 --> 18:19.467
- IF HE CALLS ME OLD AGAIN,

18:19.467 --> 18:22.600
I'LL PUT HIM
RIGHT ON HIS ASS!

18:24.933 --> 18:26.333
- I'M SORRY, GARVIN.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.600
RAY, MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO.
I APOLOGIZE, GUYS.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.200
- NO, NO! THEY SHOULD
BE APOLOGIZING TO YOU.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.333
- WHAT FOR?

18:32.333 --> 18:33.433
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING

18:33.433 --> 18:35.300
ABOUT
YOUR CHARMING GENTLEMEN.

18:35.300 --> 18:36.667
THEY'RE ANIMALS.

18:36.667 --> 18:38.267
THE MINUTE YOU TURN
YOUR BACK ON 'EM,

18:38.267 --> 18:40.100
THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR DERRIERE.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.933
THAT'S RIGHT.

18:41.933 --> 18:45.500
AND...POINTS NORTH.

18:51.033 --> 18:53.933
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

18:53.933 --> 18:57.100
YOU GUYS WOULDN'T TALK
LIKE THAT ABOUT ME, WOULD YOU?

19:01.100 --> 19:02.567
MAX?

19:02.567 --> 19:06.700
- I JUST WANTED
TO LEARN THE COMPUTER.

19:09.333 --> 19:11.967
- OH, YEAH, COME ON,
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME

19:11.967 --> 19:13.867
THAT YOU ALL HAVEN'T BEEN
SAYING THINGS ABOUT HER?

19:13.867 --> 19:15.500
- I CERTAINLY HAVE NOT.

19:15.500 --> 19:19.033
I HAPPEN TO BE MADLY
IN LOVE WITH MY WIFE.

19:19.033 --> 19:22.033
- AND I'M ENGAGED.

19:24.067 --> 19:25.400
- HEY, RAY.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.133
I THINK YOU'RE
WAY OUT OF LINE HERE.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.400
AND WHERE DID YOU GET
ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT US?

19:30.400 --> 19:32.867
- YEAH!
- YEAH, WHERE?

19:32.867 --> 19:34.733
- FROM ME!

19:34.733 --> 19:35.767
- FRANK?

19:41.933 --> 19:43.667
- YOU BROKE THE CODE!

19:43.667 --> 19:45.300
- I DON'T CARE!

19:45.300 --> 19:47.400
THE ONE TIME WE HAVE
A NICE LADY WORK HERE,

19:47.400 --> 19:49.833
YOU GUYS HAVE TO ACT
LIKE IDIOTS.

19:49.833 --> 19:51.500
I'M LIKE HER FATHER.

19:51.500 --> 19:54.000
THIS ISN'T JUST
SOME LOOSE BROAD!

19:57.867 --> 20:00.900
- THANK YOU, FRANK.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.167
- COME ON, LET'S GO.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

20:03.167 --> 20:04.700
- WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

20:04.700 --> 20:07.433
I DON'T NEED YOU TWO GUYS
TO RESCUE ME.

20:07.433 --> 20:10.367
I'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE
OF HANDLING THIS ON MY OWN.

20:13.933 --> 20:16.200
[sighs]

20:16.200 --> 20:19.000
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GENTLEMEN.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.433
I THOUGHT YOU APPRECIATED
THE WORK I WAS DOING HERE.

20:22.433 --> 20:25.767
AND I THOUGHT
MEN OF YOUR GENERATION

20:25.767 --> 20:27.500
WOULD HAVE A LITTLE CLASS.

20:29.333 --> 20:32.267
I GUESS I WAS WRONG.

20:32.267 --> 20:35.400
I HAVE TO SAY,
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED.

20:36.633 --> 20:38.267
LET'S GO.

20:51.367 --> 20:53.133
- MARIE, I'M GOING TO PLAY
YOUR CARDS THIS HAND.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.633
- ALL RIGHT.

20:54.633 --> 20:56.667
I HAVE MORE SANDWICHES
IF YOU WANT.

20:56.667 --> 20:58.067
- NO, THANKS.

20:58.067 --> 21:00.333
- HEY, MA.
OH, HI, LADIES.

21:00.333 --> 21:01.767
