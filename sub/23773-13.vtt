FILM 13

01:08.600 --> 01:11.200
<i>All animals are pack animals.</i>

01:11.720 --> 01:14.800
<i>And a loner has a whole pack within him.</i>

01:51.800 --> 01:53.320
No signs of a struggle.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.160
They just took her down and butchered her.

01:56.920 --> 01:58.120
It’s the fifth one.

02:00.960 --> 02:04.000
You study serial killings.

02:05.280 --> 02:08.720
Can you tell me why they do it?

02:12.800 --> 02:15.640
-Well, the motives are different.
-There’s only two.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.120
Power and lust.
Everything boils down to these two. What’s this?
We haven’t touched anything yet.

02:24.640 --> 02:25.960
Good job.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.160
Could you get us some coffee, Captain?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.040
What?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Where am I going to get you coffee here?

02:39.040 --> 02:40.960
You’re a detective. Search.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.720
Do you have to do that all the time?

02:48.320 --> 02:51.880
-It’s easier this way. What do you see?
-She came here on her own.

02:52.680 --> 02:53.800
She brought shoes.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.040
CASTING CALL PASS

02:55.120 --> 02:57.240
She changed shoes and clothes
and folded her things neatly.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.400
Don’t be shy. Look closer!

03:14.920 --> 03:16.000
She shaved.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.040
Makeup, hairstyle.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.080
Manicure.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.480
She was ready. Only for what?

03:29.080 --> 03:31.160
Red Lucky Advertising Agency.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.040
The TV show <i>A Star is Born</i>.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.520
Pass to the studio. Pass to the studio.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.200
An actress or a model.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.640
Only what’s she doing here?

03:44.160 --> 03:45.760
What makes people victims? Hope, again.

03:53.880 --> 03:55.080
What do you see?

03:55.560 --> 03:58.840
Don’t use your eyes. Use your instinct!
Tap into your instinct.

04:01.560 --> 04:02.360
What do you feel?

04:07.640 --> 04:09.960
-Answer me a simple question.
-What?

04:11.320 --> 04:13.800
Why did you kill her?

04:19.040 --> 04:20.480
You aren’t ready.

04:28.520 --> 04:29.760
Yes?

04:34.120 --> 04:35.520
Okay, I’ll tell him.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.560
Bergich called.

04:43.640 --> 04:47.800
He said your evaluations came back,
and he wants to see you.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.120
Have you been examined?

04:52.440 --> 04:54.160
How come you didn’t tell me?

05:10.400 --> 05:11.920
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

05:13.640 --> 05:14.840
<i>I love you.</i>

05:24.960 --> 05:27.320
There’s some confusion here
about these materials.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.160
PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION
CONCLUSIONS

05:31.240 --> 05:32.720
Will you help explain?

05:34.080 --> 05:34.920
What is it?

05:37.040 --> 05:41.000
Here are two medical conclusions
about Meglin.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.800
Four months apart.

05:43.880 --> 05:49.080
One is in June when, as I understand it,
you started your training.

05:49.480 --> 05:50.880
The second is in October.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.520
They’re completely different.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.200
Is it a mistake?

05:57.880 --> 05:59.400
What’s funny?

06:00.080 --> 06:02.080
Nothing. I just remembered a saying.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.960
Do you know what a miracle is?

06:06.040 --> 06:06.800
What?

06:09.080 --> 06:10.560
God’s mistake.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.040
Happy birthday!

06:38.960 --> 06:40.680
Congratulations, Daughter.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.600
Thanks, Pop.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.280
I decided to drop by.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.400
I never know when I’ll see you.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.080
Sasha said
you’re having dinner with friends tonight.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.360
What else did Sasha say?

06:55.760 --> 06:57.880
You’re being that way for no reason.
He’s a good guy.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.920
-He worries about you.
-Can he stop worrying about me?

07:01.720 --> 07:05.400
-Am I giving him any reason to?
-I didn’t come here to argue with you.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.200
I thought you needed this right away.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.280
That’s really nice of you.

07:12.240 --> 07:13.640
I needed it. Thank you.

07:15.200 --> 07:18.280
Do you want to go home afterwards?
We could leave in the morning.

07:19.040 --> 07:19.840
Pop.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.080
I understand. I understand.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.560
All right. I’ll see how things go.
I’ll call you.

07:25.640 --> 07:26.560
Okay.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.960
-Well, bye.
-Bye.

07:31.040 --> 07:31.760
I have to go.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.160
MARINA VASILEVA - ACTRESS, MODEL

07:54.240 --> 07:57.160
Hello. I looked up your pretty girl.

07:58.160 --> 08:02.760
Lately, she was looking for happiness
at the Ordynka production center.

08:04.600 --> 08:08.560
Photo shoots, advertising,
and selling herself.

08:08.640 --> 08:09.520
Write down the address.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.320
A strange tradition.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.320
Birthdays?

08:41.000 --> 08:45.120
You acknowledge these markers…
on the road to what?

08:47.320 --> 08:52.160
But still you count them and rejoice
as they fly by into the abyss.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.640
As usual, you have a lust for life.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.600
Am I right
in taking that as congratulations?

09:01.640 --> 09:02.440
Thank you.

09:09.560 --> 09:13.040
This evening, I’m having some friends over
at a restaurant on the riverside.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.920
Maybe you can drop by.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.280
You know I…

09:30.520 --> 09:32.800
don’t really like people.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.360
And they feel the same about me, so…

09:36.640 --> 09:39.080
I’ve had more than enough of you.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.440
Can we look at this girl?

10:41.160 --> 10:44.040
I wouldn’t suggest
you work with this girl.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.560
Why? She’s beautiful.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.280
Well, yes.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.440
But she’s hard to deal with.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.800
-How do you mean?
-She thinks very highly of herself.

10:57.640 --> 11:01.240
There was some work that involved nudity.
She agreed at first.

11:01.320 --> 11:04.520
And then said, “No, I can’t go.”

11:04.600 --> 11:06.960
And I had everything ready.
My client was there.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.400
Basically, she screwed me over.

11:09.480 --> 11:12.480
It was good
that I found a girl at the last minute.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.520
I just went to the café and…

11:31.880 --> 11:33.080
Will you two be together?

11:34.240 --> 11:35.520
What?

11:35.600 --> 11:37.480
Will you be looking together, as usual?

11:37.560 --> 11:39.160
Looking together as usual, yes.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.200
Girls.

11:48.960 --> 11:52.480
When she kills them,
how come they don’t fight back?

12:11.200 --> 12:12.800
Well, shall we? Yes?

12:12.880 --> 12:14.560
-What’s your name?
-Svetlana.

12:15.880 --> 12:18.240
Svetlana. Undress, Svetlana.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.840
Is this a casting for a TV series?

12:22.320 --> 12:24.440
Of course. For a series.
You’ll play a victim.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.120
Undress.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.320
Sit on the stool. Relax.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.240
Go ahead. Relax everything.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.200
Close your eyes.

12:56.800 --> 12:57.800
The role is like this.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.240
Relax.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.160
Relax.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.480
Do you understand now?

13:34.360 --> 13:36.080
Which channel is this for?

13:36.160 --> 13:37.680
For the biggest, honey.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.720
Do you like
how you’re spending your birthday?

13:48.800 --> 13:51.720
With you, on the job--
can’t think of anything better.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.680
Hello, girls!

13:59.760 --> 14:01.920
-Hello.
-What, are you on a casting call?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.200
Yeah, and you?

14:03.280 --> 14:04.520
Yeah, I do casting calls.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.480
-No way.
-Yeah. Fashion, advertising-- all of it.

14:07.560 --> 14:08.560
I’m a photographer.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.520
-Yeah? Can I have your card?
-I don’t give out cards.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.000
Then the calls will never stop.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.280
Let’s do this. I’ll take your picture,

14:16.360 --> 14:19.720
and then when I need something
in your look, I’ll give you a call

14:19.800 --> 14:21.040
Agreed?

14:21.120 --> 14:22.320
Let’s take a selfie.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.280
Here we go!

14:24.360 --> 14:25.360
Boobies!

14:27.520 --> 14:28.360
Awesome.

14:28.440 --> 14:29.240
Vanya!

14:30.720 --> 14:33.680
Girls, write your numbers down for me,
okay?

14:35.960 --> 14:37.600
I told you not to drink.

14:37.680 --> 14:40.400
-Anya, it was just a little.
-Do you need it for courage?

14:40.480 --> 14:42.480
Today is your turn. Are you ready?

14:45.040 --> 14:46.400
Who are you?

14:46.480 --> 14:48.760
-Anya, you don’t have to.
-I’m asking you, who are you?

14:51.080 --> 14:52.640
-A predator.
-One more time!

14:54.560 --> 14:55.600
I’m a predator.

14:55.680 --> 14:58.000
-One more time!
-I’m a predator.

15:36.240 --> 15:39.520
Don’t scream. Don’t go crazy.
It’s my birthday.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.280
Well… Can you tell me, simply?

16:01.360 --> 16:02.160
MEDICAL CONCLUSIONS

16:03.680 --> 16:07.480
I just didn’t want
to get your hopes up earlier.

16:08.640 --> 16:10.880
But you have a positive outlook!

16:12.280 --> 16:14.400
And what does that mean?

16:15.160 --> 16:18.080
It means we underestimated you.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.920
Your body is a lot stronger
than I thought.

16:24.080 --> 16:27.960
And if you take a leave of absence now,

16:28.760 --> 16:31.080
then we can fight for you.

16:31.160 --> 16:32.360
You have a chance!

16:36.040 --> 16:37.440
And if I don’t take one?

16:40.480 --> 16:42.680
It’s seems like an obvious choice!

16:43.360 --> 16:44.840
But apparently not!

16:49.240 --> 16:51.480
It’s either
the beginning of your recovery…

16:52.560 --> 16:53.960
or the beginning of the end.

16:55.160 --> 17:00.440
You should believe
that everything is possible in your case.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.360
-What’d he say?
-I’ll live.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.040
For a while.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.160
Mishanya!

18:01.880 --> 18:03.240
Kolya!

18:04.120 --> 18:06.840
-Why are you here?
-A case, Kol. A case.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.360
You brought your wife? She’s beautiful.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.800
Listen, can I talk to you for a minute?

18:14.880 --> 18:16.280
You can talk in front of her.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.400
Have me released.

18:19.480 --> 18:20.880
Talk with Bergich.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.360
I can’t. You know that.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Mishan.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.960
The doctor wanted to use electroshock.

18:29.520 --> 18:33.440
I’m starting to lose my memory.
I’m forgetting my own name.

18:38.440 --> 18:39.440
I’m sorry.

18:40.560 --> 18:41.760
I can’t. Mishanya!

18:51.280 --> 18:52.720
Mishanya!

19:04.600 --> 19:06.560
Is there really no other way?

19:12.880 --> 19:16.560
In the ’80s, Pleshakov was in charge
of the Moscow region.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.440
Maybe you’ve heard of Lesnik?

19:19.040 --> 19:21.600
Yes, I read his case.
He abducted children.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.720
Near the road by the Young Pioneer camps.

19:25.440 --> 19:28.400
He led them into the woods
and kept them at his house with toys.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.280
He taunted them, raped them,
then killed them.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.520
Pinochet was 12 years old.
His brother was seven.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.880
Lesnik held them for three weeks.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.240
His brother immediately broke down.

19:41.320 --> 19:44.640
But Pinochet kept thinking and watched.
He’s an intelligent guy.

19:45.440 --> 19:48.920
He stole some change
and pried the nails out of a window.

19:49.640 --> 19:53.680
When Lesnik fell asleep--
passed out drunk--

19:54.440 --> 19:56.200
he took his brother and climbed out.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.080
If Lesnik had woken up, of course,
he would’ve caught them.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.480
So Kolya did it right.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.560
He locked the doors and windows
and burned the house down.

20:08.280 --> 20:09.480
And then?

20:10.760 --> 20:13.720
He didn’t know
that his brother had gone back for a toy.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.880
Then he said he heard a child scream,

20:17.960 --> 20:21.560
but he was sure that his brother
was waiting in the woods.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.480
When he realized what happened,
he lost his mind.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.640
Severe psychosis.

20:26.720 --> 20:29.360
He spent 20 years in a psych ward
on drugs.

20:30.440 --> 20:31.800
They let him out.

20:31.880 --> 20:33.120
He heard crying. Vanya was calling him.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.560
First quietly, then louder.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.200
Kolya! Kolya!

20:42.320 --> 20:44.440
When the cries became unbearable,

20:45.200 --> 20:46.680
he burned down a house.

20:46.760 --> 20:49.800
He chose somewhere on the outskirts
of the city or out in the country.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.520
He burned up an old woman
on social security.

20:54.360 --> 20:56.440
I barely pulled Pinochet
away from the crowd.

20:57.440 --> 21:00.520
When he realized what he’d done,
he tried to kill himself.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.800
They resuscitated him.

21:01.880 --> 21:05.080
He spent three years
on powerful psychotropic drugs.

21:05.160 --> 21:06.560
They gave him electroshock.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.840
Now every year…

21:10.840 --> 21:12.320
he spends a month with Bergich.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.400
Electroshock and psychotropics.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.720
Otherwise, he’ll burn down another house.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.920
ISTRA SCHOOL No. 202

21:25.000 --> 21:27.680
We studied together
at the pedagogical institute.

21:28.760 --> 21:32.160
Then she left to conquer the capital.

21:32.800 --> 21:36.720
I always knew she wouldn’t stay here long.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.840
-Everyone knew.
-Why?

21:39.560 --> 21:41.520
Well, you saw how she looks.

21:42.240 --> 21:46.000
Do you want me to show you
a graduation photo?

21:46.080 --> 21:48.120
-We’d love that.
-One second.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.040
Here you go.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.640
Do you see how pretty she is?

21:59.320 --> 22:01.000
She always stuck out.

22:01.080 --> 22:04.080
The prettiest girl in school
and in the class.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.280
She was Miss City.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.800
We were all jealous of her.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.640
Who’s this girl here?

22:12.640 --> 22:14.160
With the harelip.

22:14.240 --> 22:15.640
That’s Anya Sviridova.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.880
And she doesn’t have a harelip.
It’s a scar.

22:19.320 --> 22:21.840
-Her father hit her.
-For what?

22:22.960 --> 22:25.040
Anya liked a boy named Vadim.

22:25.640 --> 22:29.720
They always made fun of Anya a little.
She was strange.

22:30.240 --> 22:33.240
But the girls paid a lot of attention
to Vadim.

22:33.320 --> 22:35.680
He actually got together with Marinka.

22:35.760 --> 22:38.600
I’ve already forgotten
what happened to them.

22:38.680 --> 22:44.200
Basically, Vadim dumped Anya,
and she beat him up.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.680
Can you imagine?

22:46.600 --> 22:48.560
The guy was an athlete.

22:49.120 --> 22:51.720
All in all,
her dad took her out of school,

22:51.800 --> 22:54.480
and she came back with her lip like that.

22:55.480 --> 22:58.280
How could we meet with her father?
Do you have his address?

23:00.520 --> 23:05.720
He was killed six years ago
when we were still in first year.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.240
-What happened?
-He was stabbed.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.720
At night in the entryway.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.080
They say
it was his own people who ordered it.

23:13.160 --> 23:14.480
Was he a crook, or what?

23:16.480 --> 23:19.320
I don’t know. That’s what people say.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.520
How do you not know this?
You were her friend.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.520
She didn’t have any friends.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.200
Everyone was afraid of her.

23:25.280 --> 23:29.120
She was always either at home
or with her younger brother.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.920
They left together
after their dad was buried.

23:32.520 --> 23:33.800
Where did they go? They didn’t say.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.080
Well… No one cared.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.920
Do you happen to have
a picture of her brother?

23:41.520 --> 23:42.160
Vanya?

23:43.680 --> 23:45.800
Hold on. One second.

23:46.440 --> 23:47.520
There you go.

24:03.320 --> 24:04.920
“You’re no king. You’re God.”

24:11.080 --> 24:13.440
-I just want to give a toast.
-Go ahead.

24:14.960 --> 24:16.480
Can you turn the music down? What’s with you, brother?

24:18.160 --> 24:20.240
Are you the brains here, or what?

24:20.320 --> 24:22.960
-Relax!
-You relax!

24:26.120 --> 24:27.320
My dear,

24:28.040 --> 24:30.240
sweet, beloved… Esenka!

24:32.400 --> 24:36.400
What can you wish a person
who has everything?

24:36.920 --> 24:39.200
I’m talking about myself,
in case you didn’t get it.

24:39.280 --> 24:40.920
No, I got it immediately.

24:41.560 --> 24:42.840
If…

24:42.920 --> 24:44.560
If I’m going to be serious, then… You are the best,

24:47.680 --> 24:50.760
the most… talented,

24:50.840 --> 24:53.480
the most uncompromising.

24:54.320 --> 24:56.680
I love you, and I wish you--

24:56.760 --> 25:00.320
Nice, but too long, my young man.
I wish you’d read this book.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.720
I don’t know what it’s about,
but it matches your dress.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.200
Happy birthday.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.160
Well, my legal scholars,

25:11.240 --> 25:13.240
-shall we drink?
-Yes! Drink!

25:16.360 --> 25:17.680
Hooray! Happy Birthday!

25:55.440 --> 25:58.240
Where are you going? Are you coming back?

26:24.040 --> 26:26.400
Occupied. Did you want to say something?

26:26.480 --> 26:28.480
-Yeah, we did.
-Well, say it.

26:29.080 --> 26:32.880
I’m already nervous.
My doctors said I shouldn’t get excited.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.160
Give me a cigarette.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.640
Tell me, what is she to you?

26:39.280 --> 26:42.560
Well?
Another girl who fell for a higher-up?

26:42.640 --> 26:43.880
So…

26:43.960 --> 26:48.440
You seriously think that if I left,
she’d suddenly be yours?

26:49.560 --> 26:50.760
-Well…
-Well, what?

26:51.440 --> 26:52.440
Not right away.

26:52.920 --> 26:55.200
Hey, brother! Who needs to relax?

26:57.640 --> 26:58.640
Zhen!

26:59.160 --> 27:00.640
Calm down!

27:01.240 --> 27:02.760
Let go! I said let go!

27:03.560 --> 27:04.560
That’s enough!

27:19.280 --> 27:21.560
“He looked into her soulful eyes,

27:22.240 --> 27:24.200
grabbed her waist
and whispered in her ear,

27:24.280 --> 27:27.160
‘Roxanna, you are so amazingly good that,
compared to you,

27:27.240 --> 27:32.800
any star is just a dim beacon
in the misty horizon.’

27:32.880 --> 27:36.760
But she was silent,
because she was a statue in a garden.

27:36.840 --> 27:40.160
And then he touched her pale hand,

27:40.240 --> 27:43.960
pressed his whole body against her hand
and cried.”

27:48.680 --> 27:50.800
Yeah. What nonsense.

27:51.200 --> 27:54.400
He looked into her soulful eyes
and grabbed her by the waist.

27:54.480 --> 27:56.480
I agree. Everything is much simpler.

30:03.760 --> 30:04.960
Why?

30:06.160 --> 30:07.800
What do you mean “why”?

30:08.560 --> 30:09.760
Why right now?

30:13.160 --> 30:14.480
Do you regret it?

30:17.520 --> 30:18.520
No.

30:20.240 --> 30:21.680
But what changed? You knew that I…

30:32.680 --> 30:34.480
Why did you wait so long?

30:39.240 --> 30:41.600
I thought that I still had time.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.520
And now? I’ll be quick.

31:51.040 --> 31:53.440
BELOVED MOTHER AND WIFE
VERA STEKLOVA

32:11.000 --> 32:12.200
Did something happen?

32:13.840 --> 32:15.440
I’m trying to understand it all.

32:19.760 --> 32:21.520
Are you doing this to spite me?

32:23.360 --> 32:25.600
Are you trying to prove something to me?

32:34.600 --> 32:35.600
You know, Pop…

32:38.320 --> 32:41.440
I quit waiting for your understanding
a long time ago.

32:43.680 --> 32:46.200
But here you’ve simply outdone yourself.

32:49.720 --> 32:51.600
I’m never coming back.

32:53.080 --> 32:55.600
That’s it. I’m done.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.760
Why did she suddenly change her signature?

34:01.840 --> 34:03.560
Because it’s not her.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.240
Vanya did it.

34:05.960 --> 34:06.960
He was nervous.

34:07.640 --> 34:09.199
A lot of blows, but not very effective.

34:10.520 --> 34:12.840
But why does she want Vanya
to start killing?

34:12.920 --> 34:14.320
Power and lust. What do you know about her?

34:27.199 --> 34:28.800
Her mother died early on.

34:33.400 --> 34:37.159
<i>Her father raised her up by himself</i>
<i>as if she were a boy.</i>

34:40.199 --> 34:41.000
Why are you blubbering?

34:41.600 --> 34:43.280
Because of Dimka Nikiforov again.

34:44.159 --> 34:45.520
You didn’t fight back?

34:45.600 --> 34:46.679
But, Pop!

34:46.760 --> 34:49.400
Why didn’t you fight back?

34:53.639 --> 34:54.760
Here, stab it.

34:54.840 --> 34:55.880
I won’t!

34:58.120 --> 35:00.640
-I said stab it!
-I don’t want to.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.480
-Stab it.
-I’m scared.

35:02.560 --> 35:03.720
Stab it!

35:03.800 --> 35:05.800
I said stab it!

35:11.840 --> 35:15.320
He had a dangerous job.
He knew he could be killed at any time.

35:20.280 --> 35:21.720
Are they ready?

35:30.560 --> 35:33.880
Don’t wait up for me today.
Feed Vanya and go to bed.

35:34.760 --> 35:35.800
Understand?

35:41.160 --> 35:42.160
Van!

36:29.760 --> 36:31.760
Get a needle and thread.

36:33.040 --> 36:34.240
Hurry! Come on.

36:53.720 --> 36:54.920
Go to bed.

37:06.120 --> 37:08.480
<i>Then, at some point,</i>
<i>she was overcome by a shock.</i>

37:08.560 --> 37:10.560
A boy rejected her and ridiculed her.

37:12.840 --> 37:15.880
She blamed her pretty friend
and wanted to kill her.

37:16.920 --> 37:18.600
-Her father stopped her.
-Here!

37:19.240 --> 37:20.320
Do you understand me?

37:20.400 --> 37:23.200
-I said, do you understand me?
-I’ll kill her.

37:23.280 --> 37:26.320
I’ll kill people like her.
Don’t you do that?

37:26.400 --> 37:28.480
Or can you only do it for money
but not for that?

37:30.400 --> 37:32.280
Anya, you’re frightening.

37:33.160 --> 37:35.400
Men will be dumping you
as long as you live.

37:36.480 --> 37:38.480
But you can’t kill people over that.

37:39.960 --> 37:42.480
-Do you understand, Daughter?
-No.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.560
Stupid fool!

37:48.880 --> 37:50.360
<i>He locked her up and beat her.</i>

37:52.600 --> 37:53.680
<i>She made peace.</i>

37:55.480 --> 37:57.360
For the time being, for appearances.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.680
Go on, go on.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.640
She waited for the right moment
to kill him.

38:11.800 --> 38:13.520
Because he’d grown weak.

38:16.360 --> 38:17.560
And Vanya? He helped her.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.240
Or saw he everything and didn’t intervene.

38:24.840 --> 38:27.400
I’m also sure she blackmailed him.

38:28.120 --> 38:30.920
They moved to the big city.
It’s easier to disappear there.

38:32.840 --> 38:36.480
A specific type of victim developed--
beautiful, young.

38:37.240 --> 38:38.440
Everything she wasn’t.

38:39.040 --> 38:41.680
A beast will run toward a good hunter.

38:43.120 --> 38:45.040
Why’d she make Vanya do it this time?

38:46.400 --> 38:48.200
She was binding him with blood.

38:55.640 --> 38:57.240
Now you’re ready.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.680
Can I get a glass of dry white wine?

39:51.640 --> 39:52.640
Hello.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.400
Can I get a cappuccino, please?

39:57.480 --> 39:58.800
Going to a casting?

40:00.200 --> 40:01.000
Yes.

40:03.280 --> 40:04.480
And you?

40:05.240 --> 40:06.880
I’m a photographer.

40:06.960 --> 40:09.160
-Yeah?
-I take glamour shots.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.240
Cool.

40:15.240 --> 40:18.720
Listen, we have a problem.
A model fell sick.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.400
Really?

40:21.160 --> 40:23.440
Look, would you want to fill in?

40:23.520 --> 40:25.120
The location has been picked.

40:25.200 --> 40:27.640
Everything is confirmed,
but there’s no model.

40:27.720 --> 40:30.960
-You really fit the type.
-Thanks so much. I’d love to.

40:31.040 --> 40:34.160
-I really like your fur coat.
-Thanks. I’d love to.

40:34.240 --> 40:36.000
-Seriously?
-What’s the style of the shoot?

40:36.080 --> 40:38.480
It’s a little bit industrial.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.160
My favorite style. Yeah.

40:40.240 --> 40:42.440
Thanks for the offer. When?

40:42.520 --> 40:43.960
Right now.

40:44.040 --> 40:46.960
-We already have the studio rented.
-Right now?

40:47.640 --> 40:49.480
-All right.
-Hold on. One second. Excuse me.

40:49.560 --> 40:51.040
I need to take this call.

40:51.640 --> 40:52.640
Yes? She fits.

40:56.480 --> 40:57.480
Okay.

40:58.160 --> 40:59.800
-Well, can we go?
-Okay.

41:00.520 --> 41:02.680
-I’ll pay.
-Thanks.

41:02.760 --> 41:03.760
Thanks.

41:12.400 --> 41:13.600
All right, bye.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.520
Where’s the car, in the parking lot?

41:16.600 --> 41:18.720
No. It’s coming now.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.640
-Hello.
-This is my assistant, Anya.

41:30.720 --> 41:31.880
Nice to meet you.

41:32.480 --> 41:36.280
-Well, shall we go?
-Where are we going? Where’s the session?

41:36.360 --> 41:38.840
In a great place. You’ll love it.
Let’s go.

41:42.360 --> 41:43.560
Get in.

42:13.160 --> 42:14.760
Guy, I need your phone.

42:14.840 --> 42:16.640
-Do you want to make a call?
-No, I want to play.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.080
-Yes.
-Track her. Where is she?

42:24.160 --> 42:25.640
-<i>Get me the location now.</i>
-I’ll figure it out.

42:25.720 --> 42:26.760
I’m waiting.

43:20.920 --> 43:23.000
Don’t stand around. Let’s go.

43:57.080 --> 43:59.080
How do you like the industrial setting?

44:03.080 --> 44:05.120
-It’s cool.
-Go on.

44:06.120 --> 44:07.320
Get undressed.

45:11.560 --> 45:12.880
Put on the blindfold.

45:13.440 --> 45:15.520
We’ll take a few shots of you
in the blindfold first.

45:53.560 --> 45:55.400
Put down the knife, or I’ll kill him.

45:59.080 --> 46:00.880
-Kill him.
-What, Anya?

46:01.520 --> 46:02.680
Anya!

46:02.760 --> 46:06.120
Anya, let’s let her go, please.
Let’s do as she says.

46:06.200 --> 46:07.240
I’m asking you, Anya!

46:07.840 --> 46:10.920
You little bitch,
do you think she’s smarter than me?

46:11.480 --> 46:13.440
I’ll show you who’s smarter.

46:14.600 --> 46:15.400
You’re finished.

46:17.080 --> 46:18.160
You’re going down.

46:19.040 --> 46:21.280
-You need help.
-Yeah?

46:21.360 --> 46:22.160
I’ll help you.

46:23.920 --> 46:25.880
Just do what I say, all right?

46:26.760 --> 46:28.360
I’m not normal, right?

46:28.960 --> 46:30.960
I’m 100 times times smarter
than all of you.

46:31.040 --> 46:34.160
You’re just a stupid girl!
You’re a clump of cells!

46:36.040 --> 46:37.240
Van, get around her!

46:39.520 --> 46:40.360
Van!

46:41.400 --> 46:42.760
Fuck you!

46:45.280 --> 46:46.280
Van!

46:46.880 --> 46:48.720
Van, get around her! Van!

46:48.800 --> 46:50.360
Vanya, don’t. She’s played you.

46:50.440 --> 46:52.320
-Shut up, bitch! Vanya!
-That’s it!

46:52.400 --> 46:55.400
I’m not doing what you want anymore!
I’m sick of you!

47:11.160 --> 47:11.800
Anya!

47:13.640 --> 47:14.640
Anya!

47:17.320 --> 47:18.280
Anya!

47:18.360 --> 47:21.400
Let her go! Anya, that’s enough! Anya!

47:28.000 --> 47:30.480
Anya! Anya, that’s enough!
I’m begging you.

47:31.120 --> 47:32.840
Anya, what are you doing?

47:34.040 --> 47:35.920
Anya, you don’t have to! Anya, please!

47:38.640 --> 47:39.520
Anya!

48:16.800 --> 48:17.720
POLICE

48:34.600 --> 48:35.600
You look nice.

48:37.600 --> 48:38.880
Let’s go.

49:17.400 --> 49:19.200
I understand you exactly.

49:19.800 --> 49:24.400
The essence of Meglin’s method
consists of establishing, let’s say,

49:24.480 --> 49:27.640
close emotional ties with the killer.

49:28.360 --> 49:29.960
Among other things.

49:33.120 --> 49:34.600
And he chose you…

49:35.560 --> 49:38.320
because of some special sensitivity
in this area?

49:39.560 --> 49:43.880
I’ll ask you to rephrase your question
more precisely. You’re a professional.

49:43.960 --> 49:47.120
Did Meglin consider you
more psychologically inclined

49:47.200 --> 49:49.760
to understand the motives
of serial killers?

49:53.640 --> 49:55.880
Why else would he have wasted time on me?

49:55.960 --> 49:58.360
-He absolutely believed it.
-And what about you?

50:14.560 --> 50:17.520
<i>I’m asking you not to do this!</i>
<i>I’m begging you!</i>

50:17.960 --> 50:20.000
<i>Please don’t do this!</i>

50:20.080 --> 50:22.760
I’ll do anything for you! Anything!

50:23.200 --> 50:26.080
I’m asking you, please! Don’t kill me!

50:26.160 --> 50:28.760
My mother is sick! I’m begging you!

50:38.040 --> 50:39.440
Don’t kill me!

50:41.000 --> 50:43.120
Don’t! Don’t kill me!

50:43.200 --> 50:45.800
I’m begging you! I’m begging!

50:47.720 --> 50:50.200
Don’t do it. You don’t have to.

50:51.840 --> 50:54.840
Don’t leave! Don’t leave, you bastard!

50:54.920 --> 50:57.200
You bastard! You animal!

50:57.280 --> 50:59.240
Don’t kill me!

50:59.320 --> 51:02.200
Stop! Stop!

51:02.720 --> 51:05.200
I’m asking you not to! No! No! No!

51:23.960 --> 51:26.000
SCENIC ROUTE
