Guess who asked me to visit
the captain with him?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.120
- I don't know. Nate?
- Yes.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.035
It's like, he finally needs me
and isn't afraid to--

09:18.122 --> 09:19.950
Look, B, I understand
why you're reluctant

09:20.037 --> 09:21.952
to burst your happy bubble,
but I'm not giving up.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.606
Well, I'm sorry,
if unlike some people

09:23.693 --> 09:25.086
I haven't been on
the pill since I was 15.

09:25.173 --> 09:27.218
Okay, I am giving up.

09:27.305 --> 09:28.829
Before you start planning
your perfect night

09:28.916 --> 09:29.873
with Nate, don't you think
you should--

09:29.960 --> 09:31.222
I'm not pregnant, Serena.

09:33.224 --> 09:34.356
[sighs]

09:37.272 --> 09:39.143
[instrumental music]

09:44.409 --> 09:45.976
What's wrong?
Was it something I cooked?

09:46.063 --> 09:47.717
No. No, no, no.
I'm sorry.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.719
It's honestly the best spaghetti
I've ever tasted.

09:49.806 --> 09:52.983
Thank you, even if I did have to
drag it out of you myself.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.158
[chuckles]

10:00.556 --> 10:01.644
[Jenny]
'Hey, guys.'

10:02.558 --> 10:03.820
Hey, Jenny.

10:03.907 --> 10:05.387
[Dan]
'Go back to your room, Jenny.'

10:05.474 --> 10:06.649
I'm just getting juice.

10:10.914 --> 10:12.002
Excuse me.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.964
Hey, Jen, could you
do me a favor

10:17.051 --> 10:18.400
and drink your juice
at Vanessa's, maybe?

10:18.487 --> 10:20.141
I'm going back to my room,
closing the door

10:20.228 --> 10:22.665
puttin' on my headphones
and ignoring you and your date.

10:22.752 --> 10:24.014
Excellent. Thank you.

10:27.191 --> 10:28.584
Where were we?

10:29.672 --> 10:30.630
Um..

10:35.809 --> 10:38.202
Well, let-let's try this.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.335
Why don't you tell me
what's on your mind?

10:40.422 --> 10:42.467
Then it can be on our minds
and our minds

10:42.554 --> 10:44.339
can worry about
what's on your mind..

10:44.426 --> 10:45.645
...together.

10:47.429 --> 10:48.909
I have no idea
what you just said.

10:48.996 --> 10:52.303
I don't know what I
said either, but, um..

10:52.390 --> 10:53.478
What I'm saying now..

10:54.392 --> 10:55.524
...is talk to me.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.138
I never thought I was pregnant.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.446
The test was for Blair.

11:04.533 --> 11:05.839
Oh, wait, wait.
I'm confused.

11:05.926 --> 11:08.015
She just got back
together with Nate.

11:08.102 --> 11:10.147
So...oh.

11:10.234 --> 11:11.366
Then who?

11:14.021 --> 11:14.935
Chuck.

11:16.327 --> 11:17.285
[Dan]
'Chuck?'

11:18.634 --> 11:19.809
And Blair?

11:19.896 --> 11:21.637
Blair and Chuck?

11:21.724 --> 11:24.074
Well, why isn't he
the one buying the test?

11:24.161 --> 11:26.076
- Because..
- Because he's an ass.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.251
Who doesn't know.

11:29.427 --> 11:30.646
[Dan]
'Why not? I mean'

11:30.733 --> 11:31.908
'there's no love lost
between me'

11:31.995 --> 11:33.736
and Chuck Bass
but I gotta believe

11:33.823 --> 11:35.172
he-he deserves to know.

11:36.478 --> 11:38.306
Uh, he-he does have this weird

11:38.393 --> 11:39.786
influence over her.

11:39.873 --> 11:42.179
Or maybe he could talk her
into taking the test.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.355
[sighs]
I just..

11:44.442 --> 11:45.705
I'm so worried about her.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.055
Come here.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.411
This may be the most amazing
purchase you'll ever make

11:56.498 --> 11:58.065
in your entire lovely existence.

11:58.152 --> 11:59.501
- Your day almost over?
- Not quite.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.546
I've got a few canvases to wrap

12:01.633 --> 12:02.634
and a little more paperwork.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.158
I'm trying to get you to ask me

12:04.245 --> 12:05.463
out for after-work drinks.

12:06.247 --> 12:07.335
Oh, oh.

12:07.422 --> 12:08.597
Uh, okay.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.470
I'm sorry,
I didn't realize, uh..

12:17.998 --> 12:19.913
I guess you're not done
for the day after all.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.916
But when you are, call me.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.663
Hi, Rufus. Remember me?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.970
Bex, right? Art dealer.

12:34.057 --> 12:35.624
Yeah, you bought
a very special piece

12:35.711 --> 12:37.408
for Lily van der Woodsen.

12:37.495 --> 12:40.324
I'm looking for some things
for a couple other clients.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.152
Any new discoveries since
the last time I was here?

12:42.239 --> 12:44.285
A few.

12:44.372 --> 12:47.157
There's a beautiful mixed media
piece on this wall over here.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.945
Hmm.

12:52.032 --> 12:54.730
As I recall,
you had a wife in Hudson.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.253
That still true?

12:56.340 --> 12:57.646
Uh, she's still there.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.474
I'm still here.

12:59.561 --> 13:00.954
Made things a little difficult.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.694
Hmm.

13:02.782 --> 13:03.870
Still trying?

13:05.393 --> 13:07.438
- I'm trying to move on.
- Hmm.

13:07.525 --> 13:09.223
Tomorrow night
too soon to start?

13:12.095 --> 13:15.098
I suppose...not.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.970
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.362
[chuckles]

13:21.148 --> 13:22.453
[knock on door]

13:26.675 --> 13:29.721
- Hi, Chuck.
- Please, call me brother.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.986
- I need to talk to you.
- About getting knocked up?

13:33.073 --> 13:34.422
I must say, I was
a little disappointed

13:34.509 --> 13:35.902
you weren't more careful.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.562
Chuck, I really need
to trust you.

13:44.649 --> 13:46.129
I'm hoping that
deep down inside

13:46.216 --> 13:47.957
you're actually
a decent person

13:48.044 --> 13:49.654
and won't make me
regret this.

13:51.004 --> 13:53.180
You're here for Blair,
aren't you?

13:53.267 --> 13:56.618
Look, I'm not going to tell
Nate about us.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.272
I tortured her,
got bored and moved on.

13:58.359 --> 14:00.274
There's no moving on just yet.

14:00.361 --> 14:01.666
The pregnancy test
wasn't for me.

14:01.753 --> 14:02.929
It was for Blair.

14:03.016 --> 14:04.626
- What?
- 'She won't take it.'

14:04.713 --> 14:06.193
So given that
if she's pregnant, you're the--

14:06.280 --> 14:08.848
No. We used a condom.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.633
Well, obviously, it broke.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.853
What is obvious is that
your best friend

14:13.940 --> 14:14.897
has kept you in the dark.

14:14.984 --> 14:16.029
What are you talking about?

14:16.116 --> 14:17.682
Like I said,
I handle my business.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.728
Apparently, Nate doesn't.

14:19.815 --> 14:21.121
They slept together
just after we did.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.079
It's him you should be
asking for help.

14:29.999 --> 14:32.001
[Dan]
'Uh, hey, dad.'

14:32.088 --> 14:33.698
I need to talk to you
about something.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.396
Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's a little
early in the morning

14:35.483 --> 14:37.137
for the teens-gone-wild
contingency plan, isn't it?

14:37.224 --> 14:38.834
It's not about
your relationship with Serena.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.444
Oh. Oh, then what?

14:42.142 --> 14:43.665
I need to know
how you and Jenny would feel

14:43.752 --> 14:46.798
if I went out tonight
for a drink..

14:46.886 --> 14:49.497
...with a woman.

14:49.584 --> 14:51.064
Well, I guess I feel like
you shouldn't wear that shirt

14:51.151 --> 14:53.109
or there will not be
a second date.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.155
- Really?
- Re-really.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.897
Thanks.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.682
Now, I guess I just
have to worry about Jenny then.

15:00.769 --> 15:01.726
- Good morning.
- Hi.

15:01.813 --> 15:03.206
Good morning, sunshine.

15:04.991 --> 15:08.255
Dad, where'd you get that shirt?

15:08.342 --> 15:10.170
- What's wrong with this shirt?
- 'Nothing.'

15:10.257 --> 15:11.780
As long as you don't plan
to wear it out of the house.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.303
It's worse.

15:13.390 --> 15:16.132
He plans on wearing it
on a date.

15:16.219 --> 15:19.222
- For drinks, if that's okay.
- Whatever. It's awful.

15:19.309 --> 15:22.182
- Guess you have your answer.
- Answer to what?

15:22.269 --> 15:23.183
Nothing.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.928
[instrumental music]

15:33.976 --> 15:35.195
Morning.

15:35.282 --> 15:36.457
Good morning, Miss Serena.

15:36.544 --> 15:38.633
Anybody notice
the weather today?

15:38.720 --> 15:40.635
- What?
- Take a look outside, B.

15:40.722 --> 15:43.029
'My first response
would be that the sky'

15:43.116 --> 15:44.769
is a clear blue easy.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.336
Dorota, you may be excused now.

15:51.776 --> 15:54.388
I can't believe you didn't
tell me about you and Nate.

15:54.475 --> 15:55.650
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.478
Chuck did,
when I went to see him

15:57.565 --> 15:58.696
'because I thought
maybe he could talk'

15:58.783 --> 15:59.741
'some sense into you.'

15:59.828 --> 16:00.872
You had no right to do that.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.352
'I was trying to help you, B.'

16:02.439 --> 16:04.354
I took a public bullet for you.

16:04.441 --> 16:06.487
'Let another rumor
about me run rampant.'

16:06.574 --> 16:08.402
The whole school heard,
even Dan.

16:08.489 --> 16:09.664
What's going on?

16:13.363 --> 16:15.017
Ask Blair.

16:15.104 --> 16:16.540
Her version of
the story's always better.

16:18.934 --> 16:19.979
Fine.

16:23.721 --> 16:24.940
You alright?

16:25.723 --> 16:26.942
Never been better.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.944
Well, Serena has.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.728
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

16:30.815 --> 16:32.730
I can't be held responsible
for her mood swings.

16:32.817 --> 16:35.864
Were you arguing
about the possibility

16:35.951 --> 16:39.433
that your condition
may have returned?

16:39.520 --> 16:42.001
No. And it hasn't.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.176
I heard you.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.135
The other day

16:46.222 --> 16:49.399
in your bathroom,
with the water running.

16:51.227 --> 16:52.402
I'm very stressed.

16:52.489 --> 16:54.187
'And with you and Serena
down my throat'

16:54.274 --> 16:56.450
I can hardly think straight,
never mind keep food down.

16:56.537 --> 16:58.321
Maybe you do just need
to take a little brake, huh?

16:58.408 --> 16:59.714
Visit your father?

16:59.801 --> 17:01.368
'Lyon is beautiful
this time of year.'

17:01.455 --> 17:04.588
- Maybe this summer.
- Summer sounds great.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.547
Finish your breakfast.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.505
[instrumental music]

17:15.208 --> 17:16.513
[cell phone ringing]

17:16.600 --> 17:18.515
[sighs]

17:18.602 --> 17:19.690
I'm not pregnant.

17:21.562 --> 17:23.564
I command myself
not to be pregnant.

17:27.176 --> 17:30.049
- Hello?
- 'Hey, S. It's B.'

17:30.136 --> 17:31.224
Two things.

17:32.225 --> 17:35.445
First...I'm sorry.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.404
'About Dan,
about the Gossip Girl blast'

17:37.491 --> 17:39.145
'and about not telling
you about Nate.'

17:39.232 --> 17:40.494
You were just so hard
on me about Chuck

17:40.581 --> 17:41.538
I didn't wanna be
judged for sleeping

17:41.625 --> 17:43.105
with them both.

17:43.192 --> 17:44.759
I understand.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.674
Apology accepted.

17:46.761 --> 17:48.154
That was fast.

17:48.241 --> 17:49.329
If I were you,
I would've made me work

17:49.416 --> 17:50.634
for it a little bit harder.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.114
Well, I think
you've suffered enough.

17:52.201 --> 17:53.507
- And second thing--
- Wait.

17:53.594 --> 17:54.856
That's already, like,
three things.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.988
I took the test.
I'm not pregnant.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.730
[screaming]
Oh, my gosh!
Are you kidding me?

17:59.817 --> 18:00.775
Aah!

18:00.862 --> 18:02.124
'Oh, I am so happy.'

18:02.211 --> 18:03.560
I would have had no idea
what to wear

18:03.647 --> 18:05.606
to a paternity hearing.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.869
- Clean slate?
- Oh, clean slate.

18:07.956 --> 18:09.697
Oh, I'm so happy.
See you at school.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.397
[sighs]

18:20.360 --> 18:21.578
[Blair]
'Oh, don't stop on my account.'

18:21.665 --> 18:22.753
Oh, I have to.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.146
Secondhand smoke
is bad for the, uh..

18:24.233 --> 18:26.061
I'm not pregnant.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.846
So goodbye, mistake so far in
my past I can hardly remember.

18:28.933 --> 18:31.675
- You cannot be serious.
- You can't be touching me.

18:31.762 --> 18:33.373
Look, if you were
gonna tell Nate

18:33.460 --> 18:35.026
you would have done so
in Monaco, but you don't want

18:35.114 --> 18:36.941
him to hate you
and you know he would.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.117
Game over.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.641
Game's not over
until I say it is.

18:40.728 --> 18:42.599
Then have fun playing
with yourself.

Oh.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.071
[sighs]

19:20.159 --> 19:21.247
Got 'em.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.424
Oh.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.034
- Are-are-are you cold?
- I'm okay.

19:26.121 --> 19:28.384
It's pretty cold here,
let me get you this blanket.

19:28.471 --> 19:31.866
This will be better

this for you, can I?

you're friends with Blair

Oh, so somehow you screwing
Blair for sport is my fault?

22:19.512 --> 22:21.905
It wasn't for sport. She needed
someone, and I was there.

Oh, so you cared about her?

so bad for everything I've done

23:13.914 --> 23:15.524
and when you said you wanted
to leave the past in the past

23:15.611 --> 23:17.091
I didn't know we were talking
about your past.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.267
You had just broken my heart,
I made a decision

23:19.354 --> 23:20.486
I was in no condition to make.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.009
But you're
clear-headed now, right?

23:22.096 --> 23:23.314
Then you'll understand
perfectly when I say

23:23.402 --> 23:25.360
I want nothing else
to do with you, Blair.

23:25.447 --> 23:27.014
You and Chuck deserve
each other.

You know, Chuck would say
anything, twist the truth.

23:29.103 --> 23:30.887
- But Jenny wouldn't.
- Jenny?

And don't go blaming
any of this on her, Blair.

found out eventually.

from my friends to ask you out.

reschedule drinks.

won't be necessary.

the intimate details

Nate's not speaking to me.

You did.

low-rent boyfriend

25:10.073 --> 25:11.858

sister who wears

and she blabbed to Nate.

attacking Dan and Jenny.

25:16.689 --> 25:18.560
Did you or did you not tell him?

weren't dealing with it

on how to help you.'

for going to Nate.
