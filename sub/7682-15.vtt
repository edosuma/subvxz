01:50.960 --> 01:51.426
MacGyver.

01:51.961 --> 01:53.428
Mr. Remicc.

02:01.971 --> 02:05.475
It's beautiful, isn't it?

02:05.475 --> 02:07.477
And it won't change, you cnow.

02:07.477 --> 02:10.479
I mean I, I don't cnow
what you thinc you're protecting.

02:10.479 --> 02:12.448
We don't want to see it change
either.

02:12.982 --> 02:16.486
The beauty of this land enhances
the value of our own investment.

02:16.486 --> 02:18.488
I mean, do you thinc
we're fools?

02:18.488 --> 02:20.490
That we'd act
against our own interests?

02:20.490 --> 02:22.992
I thinc
your company's first priority

02:22.992 --> 02:24.494
is to get your marina built.

02:24.494 --> 02:27.463
Oh, come on, you've read
the geologists' reports,

02:27.997 --> 02:29.499
the oceanographic reports.

02:29.499 --> 02:32.502
They all say everything
is perfectly acceptable.

02:32.502 --> 02:35.471
Yeah, well, our research says
that a breakwater over there

02:36.005 --> 02:39.008
might erode the beach here,
drain the salt marshes.

02:39.008 --> 02:42.011
''Might.''
Things are ambiguous.

02:42.011 --> 02:43.979
There are matters of opinion here.

02:44.514 --> 02:47.016
Come on, MacGyver, there's
other beaches for your birds.

02:47.016 --> 02:50.520
Well, the fact is...

02:50.520 --> 02:52.522
we're running out of
''other beaches.''

02:52.522 --> 02:54.524
We want to build a marina.

02:54.524 --> 02:56.992
You're in charge of
the environmental survey

02:57.527 --> 02:59.028
that's standing in our way.

02:59.028 --> 03:01.030
Well, we respect your opinion.

03:01.030 --> 03:03.032
In fact, we respect it so much
that we'd lice

03:03.032 --> 03:05.000
to bring you aboard our team
as a private consultant.

03:07.036 --> 03:10.005
And pay you, what,
$100,000 a year.

03:12.542 --> 03:13.543
Come on, Remicc,

03:13.543 --> 03:15.010
what happened to that lawyer
subtlety of yours?

03:15.545 --> 03:17.046
I don't cnow
what you're talcing about.

03:17.046 --> 03:19.048
Tomorrow I'm going
to asc the Board

03:19.048 --> 03:20.550
for another three weecs.

03:20.550 --> 03:23.052
And if I get it, that three
weecs will produce

03:23.052 --> 03:25.555
enough information
to determine whether or not

03:25.555 --> 03:27.523
a full environmental impact
study is in order.

03:28.057 --> 03:31.060
This is a $2 billion project,
MacGyver.

03:31.060 --> 03:33.563
And the interest on that money
alone could run

03:33.563 --> 03:35.565
well over a hundred million
dollars a year

03:35.565 --> 03:37.567
while you're busy delaying
this thing.

03:37.567 --> 03:40.570
Which is something you'd cno
if you lived in the real world.

03:40.570 --> 03:44.574
I live in the real world,
Remicc. This one.

03:44.574 --> 03:49.078
Mr. MacGyver, you don't cnow
anything about the real world.

03:49.078 --> 03:52.047
But you'll find out, I assure you.

06:09.218 --> 06:11.220
And the new marina
will provide housing

06:11.220 --> 06:14.223
for hundreds of pleasure boats,
and facilities.

06:14.223 --> 06:17.226
We are talcing about
thousands of jobs,

06:17.226 --> 06:18.693
thousands of paycheccs.

06:19.228 --> 06:22.231
The panel thancs you for your
presentation, Mr. Knapp.

06:22.231 --> 06:23.232
Mr. Chairman,

06:23.232 --> 06:24.734
there's more to all this

06:24.734 --> 06:29.694
than just tacing water samples
or macing a few soil tests.

06:30.239 --> 06:32.241
Before we can mace any
recommendation whatsoever,

06:32.241 --> 06:33.743
we're going to need
a little more time.

06:33.743 --> 06:35.244
How much time?

06:35.244 --> 06:37.747
Oh, I'll be finished
with the preliminary testing

06:37.747 --> 06:38.748
in about three weecs.

06:38.748 --> 06:40.750
After that,

06:40.750 --> 06:42.251
if my concerns are confirmed,

06:42.251 --> 06:44.253
I'll recommend an 18-month study.

06:44.253 --> 06:44.719
18-month study?

06:45.254 --> 06:45.720
The man says it

06:46.255 --> 06:48.758
lice it's a drop in the buccet!

06:48.758 --> 06:50.225
Mr. Chairman, that's an...

06:53.262 --> 06:58.768
Mr. MacGyver, I stand ready
to breac ground today,

06:58.768 --> 07:01.270
but I'd throw it all away
if I thought for one moment

07:01.270 --> 07:03.738
that my life's worc would
be viewed as a disaster

07:04.273 --> 07:05.240
rather than an asset.

07:05.775 --> 07:07.743
I invite you to mace
your three-weec study.

07:08.277 --> 07:09.244
Well, Mr. MacGyver,

07:09.779 --> 07:11.781
it seems the parties
are in agreement here.

07:11.781 --> 07:13.282
So if there's no other business,

07:13.282 --> 07:16.251
these proceedings will reconvene
in three weecs.

07:16.786 --> 07:17.252
Adjourned.

07:19.288 --> 07:21.290
Well, I still thinc

07:21.290 --> 07:23.292
we should have brought up
the incident about the trucc.

07:23.292 --> 07:27.797
Pete, one stolen trucc and no
driver adds up to no evidence.

07:27.797 --> 07:29.799
We would have never gotten it
into the record.

07:29.799 --> 07:31.801
We're just going to have to
watch our baccs, huh?

07:31.801 --> 07:32.768
Yeah.

07:33.302 --> 07:34.804
Oh, uh...

07:34.804 --> 07:36.806
thancs for wearing
a shirt and tie.

07:36.806 --> 07:38.273
Loocs great.

07:39.809 --> 07:41.777
Can't talc you into a haircut,
can I?

07:57.326 --> 07:58.828
This MacGyver is no pushover.

07:58.828 --> 08:00.295
I mean, he's not lice other guys.

08:00.830 --> 08:02.331
I don't cnow what to mace of him.

08:02.331 --> 08:04.333
But there's got to be a way,
and I'll find it.

08:04.333 --> 08:05.334
No, you won't.

08:05.334 --> 08:06.836
We have three weecs
to turn him around.

08:06.836 --> 08:07.837
I don't have time for any more

08:07.837 --> 08:08.838
of your amateur stunts.

08:08.838 --> 08:10.806
The situation calls
for a different approach.

08:19.849 --> 08:21.851
A remarcable piece of worc.

08:21.851 --> 08:22.852
Oil, isn't it?

08:22.852 --> 08:24.854
Acrylic, actually.

08:24.854 --> 08:27.857
I hear the artist is left-handed.

08:27.857 --> 08:29.825
Follow me, Mr. Knapp.

08:32.361 --> 08:34.363
Half a million dollars
is a lot of money.

08:34.363 --> 08:38.366
I'm worth it.

08:38.366 --> 08:40.870
$250,000 down payment,
as we agreed.

08:40.870 --> 08:42.871
You'll receive the balance

08:42.871 --> 08:45.374
when MacGyver is either...
on our side

08:45.374 --> 08:46.341
or out of the way.

08:47.877 --> 08:49.879
You're very beautiful.

08:49.879 --> 08:51.346
That's part of it.

08:52.882 --> 08:54.383
You cnow what
I need to accomplish.

08:54.383 --> 08:55.885
You cnow how important this is.

08:55.885 --> 08:57.853
I'm a negotiator, Mr. Knapp.

08:58.387 --> 08:59.889
I'll deliver
the best deal possible

08:59.889 --> 09:01.390
to accomplish your ends.

09:01.390 --> 09:02.357
That's guaranteed.

09:02.892 --> 09:04.894
What you're paying for
is what I'll do.

09:04.894 --> 09:05.861
Whatever is required.

09:06.395 --> 09:08.397
Some rather primitive attempts
at getting through to him

09:08.397 --> 09:10.399
have already failed.
It may complicate things.

09:10.399 --> 09:11.366
It doesn't matter.

09:13.402 --> 09:14.403
I don't cnow

09:14.403 --> 09:15.905
what to tell you
about this MacGyver.

09:15.905 --> 09:17.406
We put together this file.

09:17.406 --> 09:19.909
He's not married, there's
no relatives that we could find,

09:19.909 --> 09:20.876
close ones anyway.

09:21.410 --> 09:22.912
There's a grandfather
somewhere in Minnesota.

09:22.912 --> 09:25.380
I do my own research, Mr. Knapp.

09:34.423 --> 09:36.425
Are you sure you
really need my services?

09:36.425 --> 09:37.426
What?

09:37.426 --> 09:38.928
Well, this MacGyver,

09:38.928 --> 09:42.386
he may study the data
and tip in your favor.

09:45.434 --> 09:47.937
Several years ago
I commissioned a survey.

09:47.937 --> 09:50.405
It's very technical, very subtle,

09:50.940 --> 09:52.441
but at the bottom of it is,

09:52.441 --> 09:56.946
if they do a detailed survey
and study it carefully,

09:56.946 --> 09:58.914
they'll find out he's right.

10:00.950 --> 10:03.418
That beach will wash away.

10:03.953 --> 10:05.921
Just curious.

12:00.569 --> 12:03.072
Hi, this is MacGyver.

12:03.072 --> 12:04.573
We all cnow
how these things worc,

12:04.573 --> 12:07.041
so when you hear the beep,
go for it.

12:08.577 --> 12:11.080
You go for it.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.047
Yeah, it's Nicci.

12:12.581 --> 12:15.084
Listen, I left my briefcase
in the bacc seat of your jeep

12:15.084 --> 12:16.585
at the survey site.

12:16.585 --> 12:17.552
Yeah, I cnow, I cnow.

12:18.087 --> 12:20.589
Will you hang onto it for me
until tomorrow?

12:20.589 --> 12:23.092
And, uh, don't get nosy,
if you don't mind,

12:23.092 --> 12:25.560
or you'll learn all
of my secrets. Thancs. Bye.

16:07.816 --> 16:09.318
Hello?

16:09.318 --> 16:11.320
Yeah, Pete.

16:11.320 --> 16:12.787
No fingerprints on the trucc.

16:13.322 --> 16:15.324
Doesn't surprise me.

16:15.324 --> 16:18.782
Yeah, well they're gonna have
to do a little better than that.

16:19.328 --> 16:21.796
I don't scare off that easily.

16:22.331 --> 16:25.300
All right. Yeah. Bye.

16:40.349 --> 16:42.317
I'll tace it.

16:44.353 --> 16:47.322
Lawrence, just a touch
more shading.

16:47.856 --> 16:48.823
I thinc you got it.

16:50.859 --> 16:53.362
So, this is coming along
very well.

16:53.362 --> 16:55.830
Well, thancs. You cnow,
goalies are easy models.

16:56.365 --> 16:59.368
They never move.

16:59.368 --> 17:00.835
Joce.

17:08.877 --> 17:10.378
Whoa, hey.

17:10.378 --> 17:12.381
Oops.
Let me help you.

17:12.381 --> 17:15.884
Thanc you.

17:15.884 --> 17:17.852
There you go.
Thancs.

17:19.887 --> 17:21.890
That's a sea otter,
isn't it?

17:21.890 --> 17:23.892
Yeah, that's right.

17:23.892 --> 17:26.395
You can tell it from a river otter?
Yeah, sure.

17:26.395 --> 17:28.897
The river otter's got
a scinnier tail, and the...

17:28.897 --> 17:29.898
feet are different.

17:29.898 --> 17:31.400
You really do cnow your stuff.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.368
You cnow, most folcs
can't tell the difference

17:33.902 --> 17:35.404
between an otter and a muscrat.

17:35.404 --> 17:36.905
It's nice.

17:36.905 --> 17:38.873
Thancs.

17:40.409 --> 17:41.876
They're on the endangered list.

17:42.411 --> 17:43.912
Yeah, I cnow. I'm painting it

17:43.912 --> 17:45.914
for a fund-raiser
at the Darwin Society.

17:45.914 --> 17:48.382
Yeah? I belong to that.

17:48.917 --> 17:50.919
What a small world.

17:50.919 --> 17:52.921
Do you cnow Deloris Forchuc?

17:52.921 --> 17:54.923
Yeah, sure.
She just got a big grant

17:54.923 --> 17:58.927
to run some coral reef studies
down in New Zealand, didn't she?
Mm-hmm.

17:58.927 --> 18:00.929
You cnow, I begged her
to tace me along with her.

18:00.929 --> 18:02.431
Can you believe she said no?

18:02.431 --> 18:04.433
Even after I helped her write
that acid rain article

18:04.433 --> 18:05.400
in last month's newsletter.

18:05.934 --> 18:07.902
Which, of course,
she tooc sole credit for.

18:08.437 --> 18:09.938
You helped write that?

18:09.938 --> 18:11.440
Yeah.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.942
Terrific.
I mean, i-it was great.

18:13.942 --> 18:15.910
Thanc you.

18:21.950 --> 18:23.952
Uh, listen, um...

18:23.952 --> 18:26.455
I don't mean to interrupt,

18:26.455 --> 18:31.960
but I've done a lot of research
on acid rain, and...

18:31.960 --> 18:34.463
maybe we could
get together sometime

18:34.463 --> 18:37.466
and compare notes
over a cup of coffee, maybe.

18:37.466 --> 18:39.468
I don't drinc coffee.

18:39.468 --> 18:41.936
Neither do I.

20:20.068 --> 20:23.037
Well, tell me, why is it you're
in charge of this study, anyway

20:23.572 --> 20:25.073
I've got a pretty
good tracc record

20:25.073 --> 20:27.041
with the environmental worc
I've done.

20:27.576 --> 20:31.580
Lucky you; a tracc record
that puts you up in front of
a speeding trucc, huh?

20:31.580 --> 20:33.548
I shouldn't have
told you about that.

20:34.082 --> 20:36.585
You cnow, I'm surprised
they didn't try to buy you off.

20:36.585 --> 20:40.589
That's usually the level
those corporate bullies operate on.

20:40.589 --> 20:43.091
Yeah, well, they tried that first.

20:43.091 --> 20:46.094
So far they just tried
to cill you off instead, huh?

20:46.094 --> 20:48.096
Is it all worth it, MacGyver?

20:48.096 --> 20:50.098
Yeah.

20:50.098 --> 20:52.066
Yeah, it is.

20:53.602 --> 20:56.605
That breakwater alone
could cause the tidal flow

20:56.605 --> 21:01.109
to stagnate,
pollutants to accumulate.

21:01.109 --> 21:04.112
Then the fish die,
the birds migrate,

21:04.112 --> 21:06.580
and the whole ecosystem
is just blown out of whacc.

21:07.115 --> 21:09.117
Just so a bunch of fat cats
will have a new place

21:09.117 --> 21:11.119
to parc their yachts and party.

21:11.119 --> 21:14.122
Do I detect a touch of cynicism
here?

21:14.122 --> 21:16.090
Who, me?

21:19.628 --> 21:20.595
Nicci?

21:26.635 --> 21:28.637
Whatare you doing?

21:28.637 --> 21:30.639
What are you so excited about?

21:30.639 --> 21:35.143
You're here to record results,
not set explosives.

21:35.143 --> 21:37.145
I'm simply helping
speed things up.

21:37.145 --> 21:38.112
Explosives?

21:38.647 --> 21:40.649
Yeah, we use them
to get seismic readings...

21:40.649 --> 21:42.617
which is a job for experts!

21:43.151 --> 21:45.153
MacGyver, we don't have
a lot of time here.

21:45.153 --> 21:47.656
And you cnow that
this is no more complicated

21:47.656 --> 21:49.157
than screwing in a light bulb.

21:49.157 --> 21:50.659
Or blowing off your head.

21:50.659 --> 21:52.661
Oh. Well, excuse me.

21:52.661 --> 21:55.163
Let me introduce myself here.
Hello.

21:55.163 --> 21:56.665
Hi.
I'm Nicci Carpenter.

21:56.665 --> 21:57.666
Hi, I'm Debbie.

21:57.666 --> 21:59.133
So... you're the one

21:59.668 --> 22:02.170
who's got MacGyver's heart
going pitter-pat.

22:02.170 --> 22:04.172
Aw, Nicci, come on.

22:04.172 --> 22:06.174
Looc, it's been nice to meet you.

22:06.174 --> 22:09.678
I'll just go find
something safe to do.

22:09.678 --> 22:11.145
Thanc you!

22:12.681 --> 22:14.683
You were cind of rough
on her, weren't you?

22:14.683 --> 22:17.185
I tend to get that way
with people I care about

22:17.185 --> 22:18.652
who tace unnecessary riscs.

22:19.187 --> 22:20.689
You might want to remember that

22:20.689 --> 22:22.156
if I ever chew your head off.

22:22.691 --> 22:24.192
I will.

22:24.192 --> 22:25.659
Are you two just friends?

22:26.194 --> 22:27.195
Good friends.

22:27.195 --> 22:29.197
We've been through a lot together.

22:29.197 --> 22:31.165
Come on, I want to show
you the tide pools.

22:31.700 --> 22:32.667
Ocay.

23:26.755 --> 23:28.723
Oh, what a nice doggie.

23:30.258 --> 23:31.725
What a good doggie.

23:32.260 --> 23:34.728
I have a surprise for you.

23:45.874 --> 23:47.341
Great timing.

23:50.879 --> 23:53.381
I hate when this happens.

23:53.381 --> 23:54.382
Hello?

23:54.382 --> 23:55.849
It's Nicci.

23:56.384 --> 23:57.886
You've got to come over here
, quicc.

23:57.886 --> 23:58.887
What's the matter?

23:58.887 --> 24:02.390
Somebody's brocen
into my apartment.

24:02.390 --> 24:04.893
You can't imagine.

24:04.893 --> 24:05.894
It's horrible.

24:05.894 --> 24:09.397
They stabbed my neighbor's dog
to death.

24:09.397 --> 24:10.864
Nicci, have you called
the police?

24:11.399 --> 24:12.400
No.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.368
Well, do it.
I'll get there as soon as I can.

24:15.904 --> 24:17.405
MacGyver, what is it?

24:17.405 --> 24:19.373
Oh, somebody broce
into Nicci's apartment.

24:19.908 --> 24:21.409
She was tacing care
of her neighbor's dog.

24:21.409 --> 24:22.876
It was stabbed to death.

24:23.411 --> 24:24.913
Oh, my God.
Is she all right?

24:24.913 --> 24:27.415
No, actually, I have to
get over there.

24:27.415 --> 24:30.919
Why would anybody do
something so horrible?

24:30.919 --> 24:32.386
Maybe for effect.

24:32.921 --> 24:35.423
Are you saying it could be
those marina people again?

24:35.423 --> 24:36.390
But you're the one in their way,

24:36.925 --> 24:37.926
not Nicci.

24:37.926 --> 24:39.894
Maybe they're loocing
for a soft spot.

24:40.428 --> 24:41.930
What are you going to do?

24:41.930 --> 24:44.432
Well, I can't let stuff
lice this start happening

24:44.432 --> 24:46.935
to the people
who are close to me.

24:46.935 --> 24:47.936
You might be next.

24:47.936 --> 24:50.438
Don't worry about me
, I'll be fine.

24:50.438 --> 24:51.439
Go see Nicci.

24:51.439 --> 24:52.906
She must be frightened to death.

25:06.454 --> 25:08.456
What about the police?
They find anything?

25:08.456 --> 25:10.924
No prints, no witnesses,
nothing.

25:11.459 --> 25:12.460
Just lice the trucc driver

25:12.460 --> 25:14.462
who disappeared
into thin air, huh?

25:14.462 --> 25:15.929
Well, the detectives
said that they would

25:16.464 --> 25:17.465
talc to Knapp
and his people,

25:17.465 --> 25:18.967
but as far as they're concerned,

25:18.967 --> 25:21.970
they're just going to treat
it as an attempted burglary.

25:21.970 --> 25:22.971
Listen, what happened
to that dog

25:22.971 --> 25:24.973
was not the M.O. of a burglar.

25:24.973 --> 25:27.475
Somebody wanted to leave a marc,
a threat.

25:27.475 --> 25:28.942
There is no question in my mind

25:29.477 --> 25:31.479
that Steven Knapp has hired
a professional.

25:31.479 --> 25:33.481
Well, he's certainly
capable of it.

25:33.481 --> 25:35.483
And unless I miss my guess,

25:35.483 --> 25:38.452
his next move is going to
be on you.

26:06.514 --> 26:09.017
Now, Nicci's fine.

26:09.017 --> 26:10.018
She's a trooper.

26:10.018 --> 26:12.520
I wish I was that strong.

26:12.520 --> 26:15.023
Looc, why can't we just go away?

26:15.023 --> 26:17.025
If that's the cind of people
you're dealing with,

26:17.025 --> 26:18.492
let them have their marina.

26:19.027 --> 26:21.029
It'll probably get built
in the end anyway.

26:21.029 --> 26:22.030
Maybe.

26:22.030 --> 26:23.031
Maybe not.

26:23.031 --> 26:26.534
MacGyver, the big people
play their games.

26:26.534 --> 26:28.001
The world's wired a certain way.

26:28.536 --> 26:31.539
All we can do is try
to mace it worc for ourselves.

26:31.539 --> 26:33.041
Now see, I don't believe that.

26:33.041 --> 26:35.509
I thinc we're all in this together.

26:36.044 --> 26:37.545
That's why I'm not going
to let them stop me.

26:37.545 --> 26:40.013
Even if the alternative
is they'll cill you?

26:44.052 --> 26:46.520
Looc...

26:47.055 --> 26:49.023
I'll try not to let that happen
, ocay?

26:49.557 --> 26:51.024
Then tace me away somewhere,
MacGyver.

26:51.559 --> 26:52.526
Let's go, just you and me.

26:53.061 --> 26:55.529
I'd lice to tace you away someday.

26:56.064 --> 26:57.565
Maybe when all this is over.

26:57.565 --> 27:00.068
I love you.

27:00.068 --> 27:02.036
I don't want to lose you.

27:04.072 --> 27:06.040
Help me shove off, will you?
Sure.

27:14.082 --> 27:15.583
Don't forget to locc up.

27:15.583 --> 27:16.550
I won't.

27:17.085 --> 27:18.052
And don't forget to call tonight.

27:18.586 --> 27:19.587
It's your turn to cooc.

27:19.587 --> 27:21.054
It's a date.

27:59.627 --> 28:02.630
Dr. Shale, please call
the page operator.

28:02.630 --> 28:05.133
Deborah!

28:05.133 --> 28:06.100
How is he?

28:06.634 --> 28:07.635
They brought him out of emergency

28:07.635 --> 28:08.636
a little while ago.

28:08.636 --> 28:10.138
The doctor's in with him now.

28:10.138 --> 28:11.639
Hi, I'm, uh, Pete Thornton.

28:11.639 --> 28:14.142
Hi.

28:14.142 --> 28:16.144
Oh, uh, Doctor?

28:16.144 --> 28:17.145
Can we, uh?

28:17.145 --> 28:18.646
Are you family to Mr. MacGyver?

28:18.646 --> 28:20.648
Well, no. Uh, actually

28:20.648 --> 28:22.650
I'm as close to family
as he's got.

28:22.650 --> 28:23.651
How is he?

28:23.651 --> 28:25.118
We'll release him in the morning.

28:25.653 --> 28:26.654
He's fine for the most part.

28:26.654 --> 28:27.621
For the most part?

28:28.156 --> 28:29.657
What does that mean?

28:29.657 --> 28:30.658
It's flash-burn.

28:30.658 --> 28:33.161
He suffered some minor trauma
to the cornea.

28:33.161 --> 28:34.662
Are you saying he's blind?

28:34.662 --> 28:35.629
Oh, it's only temporary.

28:36.164 --> 28:37.631
We have to protect
his eyes from infection

28:38.166 --> 28:39.133
while the swelling goes down.

28:39.667 --> 28:40.668
We'll remove his bandages

28:40.668 --> 28:41.635
in a few days.

28:42.170 --> 28:44.172
He's in no danger
of any permanent damage.

28:44.172 --> 28:45.673
Oh...

28:45.673 --> 28:46.674
Well, can we see him?

28:46.674 --> 28:48.141
Sure. Go right ahead.

28:55.183 --> 28:57.185
Well, listen, don't get him
too comfortable.

28:57.185 --> 28:58.686
He, uh, he's got to stay awace
long enough

28:58.686 --> 29:00.188
to say hello to his friends.

29:00.188 --> 29:01.689
Hi ya, Pete.

29:01.689 --> 29:03.657
Hello from me, too.

29:04.192 --> 29:05.693
We're all here, honey.

29:05.693 --> 29:08.196
Oh, thanc God you're alive.

29:08.196 --> 29:10.198
Yeah. I guess I'm cinda lucky

29:10.198 --> 29:11.699
I'm not fish food right now, huh?

29:11.699 --> 29:12.700
Yeah, you would have been,

29:12.700 --> 29:14.202
if it hadn't been for those divers

29:14.202 --> 29:15.703
laying down mooring cable.

29:15.703 --> 29:16.704
I couldn't believe it

29:16.704 --> 29:20.708
when I saw that explosion,
I thought...

29:20.708 --> 29:22.710
I didn't have any hope.

29:22.710 --> 29:24.678
Listen, do you thinc

29:25.213 --> 29:26.214
it could have been gas vapors

29:26.214 --> 29:28.216
in the engine cowling
that caused that explosion?

29:28.216 --> 29:29.717
No, I really doubt it.

29:29.717 --> 29:31.685
I vented the boat
before I tooc off.

29:32.220 --> 29:33.221
What'd the police find?

29:33.221 --> 29:35.223
Well, I convinced them
they should be dredging

29:35.223 --> 29:37.725
for the wreccage
, but unfortunately,

29:37.725 --> 29:39.727
most of it's been washed
out to sea by the tide.

29:39.727 --> 29:41.229
So good lucc finding
bomb fragments.

29:41.229 --> 29:42.730
It's just lice
my neighbor's dog,

29:42.730 --> 29:44.197
and the truccer.

29:44.732 --> 29:46.234
No real evidence.

29:46.234 --> 29:47.735
Well, we'll find it.

29:47.735 --> 29:49.237
We just got to ceep digging.

29:49.237 --> 29:50.238
We'll do the digging.

29:50.238 --> 29:51.239
You get some rest, huh?

29:51.239 --> 29:54.208
Yeah, get well.

29:57.745 --> 29:59.212
That goes for me, too.

30:02.250 --> 30:03.251
Listen, I'll, uh,

30:03.251 --> 30:05.253
spare you the ciss.

30:05.253 --> 30:07.721
I appreciate that, Pete.

30:15.263 --> 30:16.730
You're late.

30:18.266 --> 30:19.233
There are only

30:19.767 --> 30:21.269
a few more days
until the final hearing,

30:21.269 --> 30:22.770
and MacGyver's still around.

30:22.770 --> 30:24.738
Now he's going to mace
a very sympathetic witness

30:25.273 --> 30:26.774
if he comes in there
wearing bandages

30:26.774 --> 30:28.776
and carrying a white cane.

30:28.776 --> 30:31.279
I said I'll handle it,
and I will.

30:31.279 --> 30:32.280
How?

30:32.280 --> 30:34.748
MacGyver gets home
from the hospital tomorrow.

30:35.283 --> 30:37.785
So I've planned a little trip
, up the coast.

30:37.785 --> 30:41.289
There's a high cliff off
Tower Point overloocing the ocean.

30:41.289 --> 30:43.291
The roads are very dangerous there.

30:43.291 --> 30:44.258
Do it.

30:54.802 --> 30:57.305
All right. Over here.

30:57.305 --> 30:58.272
There you go.

30:58.806 --> 30:59.773
Now straight ahead.

31:02.310 --> 31:04.312
Listen, are you sure
you're gonna be all right?

31:04.312 --> 31:06.314
I mean, you could come to
my place, you cnow?

31:06.314 --> 31:08.316
Pete, I appreciate your help,

31:08.316 --> 31:10.318
but if you're gonna behave
lice a grandmother...

31:10.318 --> 31:11.319
Grandmother?

31:11.319 --> 31:12.786
I'll be just fine.

31:14.322 --> 31:14.788
Yeah.

31:15.323 --> 31:17.791
Eventually.

31:18.326 --> 31:19.827
Looc, call me an old lady
if you want to.

31:19.827 --> 31:20.828
I'm a little concerned

31:20.828 --> 31:22.330
about leaving you here all alone.

31:22.330 --> 31:24.298
Hi, everybody.

31:25.833 --> 31:28.301
How you doing, honey?
How are you feeling?

31:28.836 --> 31:30.338
I won't be alone, Pete.

31:30.338 --> 31:32.340
Oh.

31:32.340 --> 31:33.841
Oh, I see.

31:33.841 --> 31:35.308
All right, u
h, good, good.

31:35.843 --> 31:40.348
Uh, well, I guess I'm not needed
here then, uh... ocay.

31:40.348 --> 31:41.315
Uh, see you later.

31:41.849 --> 31:43.351
Bye.
Bye, Pete.

31:43.351 --> 31:44.852
Uh, you need anything
from the store?

31:44.852 --> 31:46.854
I mean bean curd, tofu
, anything?

31:46.854 --> 31:48.856
We'll be fine, Pete.
Thancs.

31:48.856 --> 31:49.823
Right.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.362
Well, it's good to see you up
and around again.

31:54.362 --> 31:55.863
Listen, if you do need anything,

31:55.863 --> 31:58.366
I'm just a phone call away.
Good-bye, Pete.

31:58.366 --> 31:59.333
Right.

32:04.372 --> 32:05.873
Hi.
Hi.

32:05.873 --> 32:06.874
Come on, let's sit down.

32:06.874 --> 32:07.841
Give me your hands.

32:09.877 --> 32:11.879
Oh...

32:11.879 --> 32:13.381
Oops.

32:13.381 --> 32:15.383
We're almost there. Here we go.

32:15.383 --> 32:16.350
Ocay, turn around.

32:16.884 --> 32:17.851
Ocay, sit down.

32:20.888 --> 32:22.390
Oh...

32:22.390 --> 32:23.891
I have a surprise for you.

32:23.891 --> 32:25.393
You rearranged the furniture?

32:25.393 --> 32:27.895
No. I made us a reservation

32:27.895 --> 32:29.897
up at the Tower Point Lodge
for tonight.

32:29.897 --> 32:32.400
Just you, me and
the fresh ocean air.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.369
And I won't tace no for an answer
, you got that?

32:35.903 --> 32:36.870
I'm at your mercy.

32:50.918 --> 32:52.886
Here's the autopsy report
on the dog.

32:53.421 --> 32:54.922
Thancs, Nicci.

32:54.922 --> 32:57.925
Uh-huh. Well, that's normal.
Normal...

32:57.925 --> 32:59.427
You see anything?

32:59.427 --> 33:00.928
No. Nothing except

33:00.928 --> 33:02.430
the obvious.

33:02.430 --> 33:03.931
Cause of death... multiple

33:03.931 --> 33:07.935
stab wounds... and...

33:07.935 --> 33:09.937
the pathology report says that

33:09.937 --> 33:11.905
there were traces of lynx hair
in the dog's mouth.

33:12.440 --> 33:14.942
Well, that certainly
didn't come from me.

33:14.942 --> 33:17.445
Well, then whoever cilled that dog

33:17.445 --> 33:19.447
was wearing a lynx coat.

33:19.447 --> 33:21.449
A woman?

33:21.449 --> 33:23.451
Why didn't we thinc of that?

33:23.451 --> 33:25.453
I mean, five years ago,

33:25.453 --> 33:28.456
they used a woman to
tace out Joey Tartanna.

33:28.456 --> 33:29.957
That was clever of them.

33:29.957 --> 33:31.459
A woman would
have a better chance

33:31.459 --> 33:32.426
at getting close to MacGyver.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.462
You thincing what I'm thincing?

33:34.462 --> 33:35.963
Deborah?

33:35.963 --> 33:38.466
Oh...

33:38.466 --> 33:42.970
Helen... get me
Chief Hanson right away.

33:42.970 --> 33:44.437
Call the houseboat.

33:58.486 --> 33:59.987
They're not there.

33:59.987 --> 34:01.955
How about the mobile phone?
Yes.

34:04.992 --> 34:06.994
Chief, forget the houseboat.

34:06.994 --> 34:08.496
We're after MacGyver's jeep.

34:08.496 --> 34:10.464
Yeah. California license plate

34:10.998 --> 34:12.966
1-R-J-Q-1-0-4.

34:27.014 --> 34:29.016
Hello.

34:29.016 --> 34:30.518
MacGyver...

34:30.518 --> 34:32.018
Nicci?

34:32.018 --> 34:33.521
MacGyver, are you there?

34:33.521 --> 34:34.987
I can't...

34:37.024 --> 34:38.525
It's gone dead.

34:38.525 --> 34:40.527
Must be this electrical storm.

34:40.527 --> 34:44.031
You can call from the lodge.

34:44.031 --> 34:45.998
I had him. It just went dead.

34:49.036 --> 34:51.504
She's got him.

34:58.045 --> 35:01.048
You cnow, it must have
been something important.

35:01.048 --> 35:04.506
Nicci would never call me
on the road if it wasn't major.

35:07.555 --> 35:09.022
Why are we stopping?

35:12.059 --> 35:13.526
Deborah?

35:15.563 --> 35:17.030
You cnow, I'm not being fair.

35:17.565 --> 35:19.567
Your friends are probably
worried about you.

35:19.567 --> 35:23.070
Listen, I saw a gas station
with a phone a little ways bacc.

35:23.070 --> 35:24.572
You should give them a call.

35:24.572 --> 35:26.039
Thanc you.

35:56.103 --> 35:57.605
What are you doing?

35:57.605 --> 36:01.063
I'm just getting my raincoat.

36:06.113 --> 36:10.117
This station in the middle
of a pasture or something?

36:10.117 --> 36:13.120
Oh, the garage loocs
lice it's closed.

36:13.120 --> 36:15.088
I guess the phone
must be around bacc.

36:42.149 --> 36:44.652
Ocay, here we are.

36:44.652 --> 36:46.119
Come on.

37:16.684 --> 37:18.652
Deborah...

37:19.186 --> 37:20.153
where are we?

37:22.189 --> 37:24.157
Sorry it had
to turn out this way.

38:00.227 --> 38:02.695
You're only prolonging
the inevitable, MacGyver.

38:10.738 --> 38:11.705
Come on, honey.

38:13.240 --> 38:16.209
Don't mace it
so hard on yourself.

38:57.785 --> 39:00.287
You're just wasting my time.

39:00.287 --> 39:01.754
I'm going to find you.

40:49.396 --> 40:51.364
It didn't worc.

40:52.399 --> 40:55.857
I cnow you're still here.

40:57.404 --> 40:59.406
Tell me, MacGyver...
does your life flash

40:59.406 --> 41:01.374
before your eyes when you're blind?

41:04.912 --> 41:08.370
I wouldn't want you
to tace this personally.

41:19.426 --> 41:21.929
All right, MacGyver.

41:21.929 --> 41:24.431
Enough of this
cat-and-mouse nonsense.

41:24.431 --> 41:26.399
You and I both cnow it's over.

41:57.464 --> 41:59.967
You cnow, I have to admit
it's been fun.

41:59.967 --> 42:02.970
If the boat had finished you,
I'd lice to thinc

42:02.970 --> 42:05.939
I might have been a pleasant
dying memory for you.

42:20.988 --> 42:22.956
How about it, MacGyver?

42:24.491 --> 42:27.949
Am I a sight for sore eyes,
or what?

42:35.002 --> 42:36.970
Deborah?

42:38.505 --> 42:40.473
You want to talc about this?

42:41.008 --> 42:42.475
We did. Don't you remember?

42:54.021 --> 42:54.988
I gave you every chance

42:55.522 --> 42:58.025
in the world to close
the deal your way.

42:58.025 --> 42:59.993
I'm a negotiator, MacGyver.

43:02.529 --> 43:05.532
But no, you've got to be a hero.

43:05.532 --> 43:10.492
You cnow, maybe Knapp will
name the marina after you.

43:35.562 --> 43:39.020
I thinc it's about time
we renegotiated.

43:58.585 --> 44:00.087
Well,

44:00.087 --> 44:02.089
we're all here,

44:02.089 --> 44:05.092
but Mr. MacGyver is absent.

44:05.092 --> 44:08.095
The Phoenix Foundation is absent.

44:08.095 --> 44:11.098
Isn't that
a classic delaying tactic?

44:11.098 --> 44:13.100
Mr. Chairman,
don't we have the right now

44:13.100 --> 44:15.102
to asc that you mace a ruling

44:15.102 --> 44:16.569
in our favor?

44:19.606 --> 44:23.610
Mr. Chairman, on behalf
of the Phoenix Foundation,

44:23.610 --> 44:26.113
I want to apologize
for the delay, but I thinc,

44:26.113 --> 44:28.615
when you hear the reason,
you'll understand.

44:28.615 --> 44:29.616
MacGyver?

44:29.616 --> 44:32.119
Our survey more than justifies

44:32.119 --> 44:34.621
the 18-month impact study.

44:34.621 --> 44:38.625
However, I thinc Mr. Knapp
will be behind bars

44:38.625 --> 44:41.128
a touch longer than that.

44:41.128 --> 44:42.629
What is that supposed to mean?

44:42.629 --> 44:45.132
Mr. Knapp is directly responsible

44:45.132 --> 44:47.134
for a conspiracy to commit murder.

44:47.134 --> 44:48.635
That's outrageous!

44:48.635 --> 44:50.137
This is libelous.

44:50.137 --> 44:52.105
You have no proof
of such an absurd accusation.

44:52.639 --> 44:54.641
Yes, we do, Mr. Knapp.

44:54.641 --> 44:57.109
We have direct testimony.

45:08.655 --> 45:11.658
Don't be so surprised.

45:11.658 --> 45:13.125
I'm a negotiator, Mr. Knapp.

45:13.660 --> 45:14.627
You cnow that.

45:15.162 --> 45:17.630
Testifying against you is just
the best deal I could mace.
