00:00.431 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:08.079 --> 00:10.281
Hey, Leo,
where you been?

00:10.281 --> 00:13.943
I just finished watching
a 24-hour horror movie marathon.

00:13.943 --> 00:16.387
I was so scared,
I chewed through
all my fingernails.

00:16.387 --> 00:18.749
But on the bright side,
I had a big bowl of popcorn,

00:18.749 --> 00:20.721
so they were
delightfully tasty.

00:20.721 --> 00:23.094
Guys, how is our first
Halloween at the academy

00:23.094 --> 00:25.256
going to be spooky
when all we have

00:25.256 --> 00:27.998
is this pathetic little box
of Halloween decorations?

00:27.998 --> 00:30.261
And, uh, what is this
disgusting slime

00:30.261 --> 00:32.103
in the trick-or-treat bowl?

00:32.103 --> 00:34.665
Oh, that's not slime.
That's last year's pumpkin.

00:34.665 --> 00:36.937
I'm surprised
it didn't keep.

00:36.937 --> 00:38.309
( sniffs, gags )

00:38.309 --> 00:40.511
Ew!

00:40.511 --> 00:42.113
Hey, guys.

00:42.113 --> 00:44.415
Bob, what are you
doing here?

00:44.415 --> 00:46.677
All the other students
are out with Mr. Davenport

00:46.677 --> 00:50.521
on a field trip to
the Davenport birthplace
and museum.

00:50.521 --> 00:54.555
Gosh darn it, I can't
believe I'm missing that.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.786
Really, Bob?

00:55.786 --> 00:57.988
Oh, come on.
Part of the tour

00:57.988 --> 00:59.660
is him re-enacting
his birth.

01:01.892 --> 01:04.595
This kid might be
smarter than we thought.

01:04.595 --> 01:06.467
Ooh, smoothie.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.369
Maybe not.

01:10.641 --> 01:12.803
Later, machine people.

01:12.803 --> 01:14.745
I'm taking the metal detector
to the beach

01:14.745 --> 01:16.107
to look for
other people's money.

01:16.107 --> 01:19.110
So what, you're done
going through our wallets?

01:19.110 --> 01:21.612
Yep. How do you think
I paid for this thing?

01:21.612 --> 01:25.156
If you need me, I'll be at
the island across the way.

01:25.156 --> 01:27.258
What island?
The deserted one?

01:27.258 --> 01:30.821
Yeah. Care to join me?

01:30.821 --> 01:33.324
There's room for two
in my inflatable kayak.

01:33.324 --> 01:35.166
If you're good,
we could play

01:35.166 --> 01:38.969
shipwrecked passenger
and curious island native.

01:38.969 --> 01:41.772
How about we play
shipwrecked passenger

01:41.772 --> 01:45.806
and rescue pilot
who just keeps flying?

01:47.007 --> 01:49.810
Hey, I've always wondered
about that island.

01:49.810 --> 01:52.743
Oh, maybe
there are waterfalls.

01:52.743 --> 01:54.485
And caves.

01:54.485 --> 01:57.288
Maybe we'll be introduced
to cool new species of insects.

01:57.288 --> 02:02.853
And then, we can introduce
them to an uncool species
of human.

02:02.853 --> 02:05.396
Trust me. You don't wanna
go to that island.

02:05.396 --> 02:07.398
From what I hear,
that place is uninhabited

02:07.398 --> 02:09.229
for a reason.

02:09.229 --> 02:12.062
It's a scary jungle
full of venomous snakes,

02:12.062 --> 02:15.806
rabid bats and toxic plants
that cause rashes.

02:15.806 --> 02:17.208
Rashes don't
bother me.

02:17.208 --> 02:18.809
I'm rarely
without one.

02:20.371 --> 02:22.613
I'm headed to the mainland
for a supply run.

02:22.613 --> 02:26.517
Just promise me
you won't go there.

02:26.517 --> 02:28.979
Sure. No problem.

02:31.051 --> 02:34.054
Well, I'm off to
that other island.

02:34.054 --> 02:37.228
Hey, Douglas just
told you not to go there.

02:37.228 --> 02:39.390
Yeah, well, the only voices
I listen to

02:39.390 --> 02:41.131
are the three
inside my head.

02:45.436 --> 02:48.469
The world's first
 bionic superhumans.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.271
They're stronger than us.

02:50.271 --> 02:53.073
Faster, smarter.

02:53.073 --> 02:55.476
The next generation
 of the human race is...

02:55.476 --> 02:57.678
living on a bionic island.

03:40.090 --> 03:42.022
Douglas was right.

03:42.022 --> 03:44.995
- This place is creepy.
- ( bird squawking )

03:44.995 --> 03:46.957
Okay, seen it, saw it,
done, Dooley out.

03:46.957 --> 03:49.129
Leo.

03:49.129 --> 03:51.201
I can't believe you.

03:51.201 --> 03:53.103
You just watched
a horror movie marathon

03:53.103 --> 03:54.204
and now you're scared?

03:54.204 --> 03:56.136
I am not scared.

03:56.136 --> 03:58.939
I wanna leave for
a very manly reason.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.572
I have a blister
on my pinky toe.

04:01.572 --> 04:05.616
The island is full of
animals I've never seen before.

04:05.616 --> 04:07.378
Some of them aren't even
in my database.

04:09.450 --> 04:12.483
Whoa! Here comes
one crashing through
the underbrush.

04:12.483 --> 04:15.155
I bet it's an exotic
wild boar.

04:15.155 --> 04:18.028
( angry muttering )

04:19.029 --> 04:21.591
You were right.

04:21.591 --> 04:23.864
Why are you
wearing gloves?

04:23.864 --> 04:27.097
Don't wanna devalue
any rare finds
with my oily fingers.

04:27.097 --> 04:30.601
Also, I'm on an island
with three people I despise.

04:30.601 --> 04:33.304
Mom always said,
"Never leave fingerprints."

04:35.175 --> 04:37.848
Have you ever even
found anything valuable
with that thing?

04:37.848 --> 04:39.380
For your information,

04:39.380 --> 04:41.352
I found my grandma's
lost wedding ring.

04:41.352 --> 04:43.654
It's been in my family
for generations.

04:43.654 --> 04:46.216
Wow. That's actually
kind of sweet.

04:46.216 --> 04:49.860
Yeah. I made a bundle on it
when I sold it back to her.

04:49.860 --> 04:52.363
Well, this island
is obviously uninhabited,

04:52.363 --> 04:55.165
so I highly doubt
you'll find anything here.

04:55.165 --> 04:56.997
( loud beeping )

04:56.997 --> 04:58.098
Jackpot!

05:07.307 --> 05:11.181
Pay day. A skull found out here
in the middle of nowhere.

05:11.181 --> 05:12.913
It's gotta be
some sort of treasure.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.615
I'm gonna make a fortune!

05:14.615 --> 05:16.617
You know that's not
a real skull, right?

05:16.617 --> 05:18.649
It's made of metal.

05:18.649 --> 05:21.622
Looks more human
than those two.

05:21.622 --> 05:25.125
I've heard about ancient
relics being taken from
their resting place.

05:25.125 --> 05:28.098
They say bad things happen
to the people that remove them.

05:28.098 --> 05:30.931
What harm is taking
a little old skull gonna do?

05:30.931 --> 05:32.262
Let's let Boney decide.

05:32.262 --> 05:34.705
Hey, Boney, do you mind
if I take you?

05:34.705 --> 05:37.037
Of course not.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.509
Sell me.

05:38.509 --> 05:41.241
Just keep me away
from these losers.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.414
Look, that skull
is creepy,

05:43.414 --> 05:45.416
and more importantly,
it doesn't belong to you.

05:45.416 --> 05:48.178
- Leave it.
- You guys are wimps.

05:48.178 --> 05:51.081
Fine. If you're
that freaked out,
I'll put it back.

05:52.923 --> 05:54.425
- Good.
- Let's go.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.158
Suckers.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.590
Come on, Boney,
let's get outta here.

05:59.590 --> 06:02.393
You remind me
of my grandma

06:02.393 --> 06:04.364
the second time
I took her ring.

06:09.339 --> 06:13.243
( cackling laughter )

06:13.243 --> 06:16.577
Hey, Bob, check out
this prank I set up
for Halloween.

06:16.577 --> 06:19.249
Awesome.
Who's Halloween?

06:19.249 --> 06:22.152
Halloween is not a person.

06:22.152 --> 06:24.615
It's the best holiday ever.

06:24.615 --> 06:26.186
Oh, right, you're
a blank slate

06:26.186 --> 06:27.818
because of Krane's
mind control.

06:27.818 --> 06:29.890
Plus I don't have
a good memory.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.522
And I'm not
a very good listener.

06:31.522 --> 06:33.464
Plus I don't have
a good memory.

06:33.464 --> 06:37.227
Halloween is a holiday
where you scare people.

06:37.227 --> 06:39.169
You can help me prank
Chase, Bree and Leo.

06:39.169 --> 06:41.331
- Cool.
- Here they come.

06:41.331 --> 06:43.073
Quick, distract them so I can
spring this on them.

06:43.073 --> 06:44.575
- They'll never
see it coming.
- On it.

06:49.309 --> 06:51.682
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Bob,
what you doing?

06:51.682 --> 06:53.944
I'm distracting you
so Adam can scare you

06:53.944 --> 06:55.486
with this fake
Halloween thingy.

06:58.449 --> 07:01.091
I am so glad
you and Adam found each other.

07:03.423 --> 07:08.398
Bob. You can't warn people
they're gonna be scared
before you scare them.

07:08.398 --> 07:10.761
Who would be scared
when they know it's coming?

07:10.761 --> 07:13.163
- ( cackling laughter )
- ( screaming )

07:19.409 --> 07:22.042
Authentic vintage
collectible.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.274
Made out of...

07:24.274 --> 07:27.548
rare black gold.

07:30.581 --> 07:32.583
She lied to us
and took the skull
from the island.

07:32.583 --> 07:34.224
We're cursed.

07:34.224 --> 07:36.386
Relax. I've been with
the skull all day.

07:36.386 --> 07:38.228
Nothing bad
has happened to me.

07:38.228 --> 07:40.290
A little heartburn
around noon.

07:40.290 --> 07:42.733
I got a chunk of hot dog
stuck in the old air hose,

07:42.733 --> 07:44.434
but I'll work it out
by dinner.

07:44.434 --> 07:47.067
Just because nothing
bad has happened yet

07:47.067 --> 07:48.298
doesn't mean it won't.

07:48.298 --> 07:50.741
In that movie,
 Skull Apocalypse,

07:50.741 --> 07:52.442
a group of kids dug up
a cursed skull,

07:52.442 --> 07:55.275
and one by one,
they all died horrible deaths

07:55.275 --> 07:56.577
because there's
no cheating fate.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.709
We're all gonna die.

07:58.709 --> 08:01.411
Good to see you're
not over-reacting.

08:01.411 --> 08:04.585
That's exactly what the pretty
brown-haired girl said

08:04.585 --> 08:06.757
right before she became
the pretty brown-haired girl

08:06.757 --> 08:09.289
on a hook.

08:09.289 --> 08:12.523
Perry, you shouldn't
have taken it from that island.

08:12.523 --> 08:14.464
You don't know
who buried it there or why.

08:14.464 --> 08:16.426
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
In Skull Apocalypse,

08:16.426 --> 08:18.699
there was this
really tall man
in blue jean overalls,

08:18.699 --> 08:21.471
and he had no face.

08:21.471 --> 08:24.905
Okay, Leo, relax.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.607
It was just a movie.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.108
Was it, Bree?

08:28.108 --> 08:29.610
Or was it a premonition?

08:29.610 --> 08:30.881
We're all gonna die!

08:30.881 --> 08:32.442
Stop saying that!

08:32.442 --> 08:35.385
That is it. This thing is going
back where it belongs.

08:35.385 --> 08:37.116
Wait. They're
already bidding on it.

08:37.116 --> 08:38.919
Oh, never mind.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.491
I'll just find a real skull
and spray paint it.

08:42.491 --> 08:45.025
You've got a nice one.

08:48.659 --> 08:50.460
Sorry I messed up
your prank.

08:50.460 --> 08:52.563
But this will
make up for it.

08:52.563 --> 08:55.836
Welcome to Bob's
house of terror.

08:55.836 --> 08:58.468
Everything in the world
I find horrifying.

08:58.468 --> 09:00.510
Cool. Let's see
what you got.

09:00.510 --> 09:05.175
First up,
old math tests.

09:06.446 --> 09:09.219
And...

09:09.219 --> 09:11.351
a potato whose eyes
follow you

09:11.351 --> 09:13.323
no matter
where you go.

09:14.554 --> 09:18.558
Finally, the most
horrifying of all.

09:22.232 --> 09:25.035
Come on, Bob.
No one thinks
Santa's scary.

09:25.035 --> 09:26.436
Are you kidding?

09:26.436 --> 09:28.238
A strange man
breaks into your house

09:28.238 --> 09:30.370
in the middle of the night
and steals your cookies.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.042
No, thank you.

09:32.042 --> 09:35.405
Bob, sh.
He's watching.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.448
He is?

09:38.448 --> 09:42.152
Yeah. He sees you
when you're sleeping,

09:42.152 --> 09:43.383
he knows when
you're awake.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.686
Oh my, he is creepy.

09:48.388 --> 09:51.361
( high-pitched squealing )

09:51.361 --> 09:53.523
What's wrong?

09:53.523 --> 09:55.996
Dooley was right.
The skull is cursed.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.367
Over the last hour,

09:57.367 --> 09:59.369
I've had three
near-fatal accidents.

09:59.369 --> 10:01.531
That's two more
than my daily average.

10:01.531 --> 10:03.433
Okay, what are you
talking about?

10:03.433 --> 10:05.535
First, I was in the shower

10:05.535 --> 10:07.477
when the glass door
shattered into jagged pieces.

10:07.477 --> 10:10.841
Then, I drew a bath,
but the blow dryer fell in,

10:10.841 --> 10:12.442
electrocuting the water.

10:12.442 --> 10:14.514
So then, I hopped into
the kitchen sink,

10:14.514 --> 10:17.517
but my foot got stuck
in the garbage disposal.

10:17.517 --> 10:20.520
Why were you that determined
to get clean?

10:20.520 --> 10:21.922
I'm like a lizard.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.094
Once a year, I shed
my top layer.

10:24.094 --> 10:26.356
There's a whole skin
outline of me

10:26.356 --> 10:28.428
circling the drain.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.432
- ( creaking noise )
- What was that?

10:36.606 --> 10:38.538
See? What did I tell you?

10:38.538 --> 10:40.841
Okay, okay,
everyone just calm down.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.473
This is probably just
a freakish coincidence.

10:43.473 --> 10:45.515
Nothing to be scared of.

10:51.351 --> 10:54.154
That is not
a coincidence.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.386
This is just like the movie.

10:56.386 --> 10:58.428
You brought the curse back,
and now we're doomed.

10:58.428 --> 11:00.360
Okay, everyone
just calm down.

11:00.360 --> 11:04.835
If we stay still, nothing bad
can happen to us, right?

11:10.200 --> 11:12.372
My hairpiece.

11:12.372 --> 11:15.405
Okay, well,
there you have it.

11:15.405 --> 11:18.578
The curse is real,
and her hair is not.

11:25.115 --> 11:27.988
The knives came flying
right at me.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.490
And then the fireplace
shot a fireball right at us.

11:30.490 --> 11:33.163
That's why my hair
smells like barbecue.

11:33.163 --> 11:35.926
That's not why your hair
smells like barbecue.

11:35.926 --> 11:40.670
This is now officially
a deathtrap island,

11:40.670 --> 11:43.433
just like in that movie
 Deathtrap Island.

11:43.433 --> 11:46.376
Okay, let me
get this straight.

11:46.376 --> 11:48.008
Only the people
who took the skull

11:48.008 --> 11:51.181
- from the island
are cursed, right?
- Yes.

11:51.181 --> 11:53.013
Oh, cool. Then Bob and I
are all good.

11:54.184 --> 11:55.916
Don't stand there, Bob.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.348
Bad things are gonna
happen to 'em.

11:58.348 --> 12:00.590
Oh, you mean the knives
and the ceiling fan?

12:00.590 --> 12:02.352
That wasn't a curse.

12:02.352 --> 12:04.624
- That was Chase.
- What?

12:04.624 --> 12:08.228
Yeah. I saw him setting up
his own house of terror.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.701
He used his magnetism app
to control those knives.

12:11.701 --> 12:13.403
I would've told you guys
earlier,

12:13.403 --> 12:15.665
but I didn't wanna ruin
the surprise.

12:15.665 --> 12:17.437
That doesn't make
any sense.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.070
Why would Chase
do that?

12:20.070 --> 12:23.243
Because I want
to kill you!

12:23.243 --> 12:25.115
( all screaming )

12:25.115 --> 12:27.617
The curse must've
possessed him and
made him crazy.

12:31.481 --> 12:35.525
Wow. Chase, you are way better
at scaring people than Adam.

12:36.827 --> 12:39.229
You really look like
you're gonna stab me.

12:39.229 --> 12:42.562
- ( grunting )
- ( screaming )

12:46.036 --> 12:49.499
I don't get it.
Why would the skull
only curse Chase?

12:49.499 --> 12:51.802
This is exactly like
what happened in
this other movie,

12:51.802 --> 12:53.543
When Cursed Friends Kill,

12:53.543 --> 12:55.205
where a curse made
this kid turn into
a monster

12:55.205 --> 12:57.747
and go after
all of his friends.

12:57.747 --> 13:01.211
Okay, where do you even
find these movies?

13:01.211 --> 13:03.553
I had to special order
that one from Finland.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.716
Ah, Finland.

13:06.716 --> 13:08.618
A little-known fact.

13:08.618 --> 13:10.490
They invented dogs.

13:12.622 --> 13:15.265
Okay, we have to stop Chase
before he hurts anyone.

13:15.265 --> 13:17.727
Here, robot,
use my laser cuffs.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.074
If this skull
is really cursed,

13:24.074 --> 13:25.605
we have to
get rid of it.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.507
I'm taking it back
to the island.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.609
Wait.

13:29.609 --> 13:30.710
I'll miss you.

13:40.350 --> 13:42.552
What's going on?

13:42.552 --> 13:44.855
You came back
to rescue me.

13:44.855 --> 13:47.427
Take me away
from this place.
We can live on the run.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.798
No looking back.

13:48.798 --> 13:50.600
I know a guy who can
get us new passports

13:50.600 --> 13:54.704
and jobs at a tire factory
in Uzbekistan.

13:54.704 --> 13:56.506
This is all
your fault, Perry.

13:56.506 --> 13:58.869
You're the one who brought
the skull back from the island

13:58.869 --> 14:00.110
and cursed Chase.

14:00.110 --> 14:01.942
You went to the island?

14:01.942 --> 14:04.374
The one I said specifically
not to go to?

14:04.374 --> 14:05.946
Sorry, Dougie.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.617
I've been
a bad, bad girl.

14:07.617 --> 14:10.280
Let's work on
my punishment together.

14:12.822 --> 14:15.585
And while you were there,
you found a skull

14:15.585 --> 14:16.826
made of shiny black metal?

14:16.826 --> 14:18.558
How did you know that?

14:18.558 --> 14:21.761
Because I know
what's going on.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.793
It's not a curse.

14:23.793 --> 14:25.795
Chase has a virus

14:25.795 --> 14:29.169
that I created
during my evil days.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.800
It turns people psychotic,

14:30.800 --> 14:33.043
and makes them want to
annihilate everyone.

14:34.604 --> 14:38.348
Why would you ever
create such a thing?

14:38.348 --> 14:40.110
I was going through
a rough patch,

14:40.110 --> 14:42.412
and wanted to watch
societies destroy each other.

14:42.412 --> 14:46.756
Can you say
anything wrong?

14:46.756 --> 14:49.589
I never meant
for it to be used.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.162
It was in
my big box of evil.

14:52.162 --> 14:54.594
So when I saw
that uninhabited island,

14:54.594 --> 14:57.797
I thought I might be able
to bury my past

14:57.797 --> 14:59.499
where nobody
would ever go.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.601
Why didn't you just
destroy the virus?

15:05.805 --> 15:07.637
I guess I figured
it would be good to have around

15:07.637 --> 15:10.110
in case I ever got
the evil bug again.

15:10.110 --> 15:13.913
Spend enough time with me and
you're bound to catch something.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.715
You guys are cute.

15:15.715 --> 15:18.148
I should grab Bree,
and we can double date.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.053
The skull was just
an old paperweight.

15:23.053 --> 15:26.056
It got contaminated
when I spilled some
of the virus on it.

15:26.056 --> 15:27.727
That's why I buried it.

15:27.727 --> 15:30.100
Anyone who touches it
becomes a crazed maniac.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.702
Crazed maniac.

15:32.702 --> 15:35.505
But I'm the one
who found it,

15:35.505 --> 15:37.267
and it didn't
turn me evil.

15:37.267 --> 15:40.640
Probably because
you're already there.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.643
No, you were protected by
the gloves you were wearing.

15:43.643 --> 15:46.716
Wait, so Chase turned into
a deranged maniac

15:46.716 --> 15:48.618
because of the virus
you created?

15:48.618 --> 15:51.051
Yeah!

15:51.051 --> 15:53.823
This Halloween thing
is way too complicated.

15:53.823 --> 15:55.225
When's the holiday

15:55.225 --> 15:58.188
where we go around
the yard laying eggs?

15:58.188 --> 16:00.660
Guys.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.932
This is just like
that movie where--

16:02.932 --> 16:05.435
- ALL: Shut it!
- Shut it!

16:06.596 --> 16:08.538
Where's the skull?

16:08.538 --> 16:10.700
We have to destroy it
before anyone else
gets infected.

16:10.700 --> 16:13.803
( gasps ) Bree has it.
She's taking it
to the island.

16:13.803 --> 16:16.746
What?! If she touched it,
she's infected.

16:16.746 --> 16:18.608
We have to find her
before it's too late.

16:18.608 --> 16:20.210
This is just like that...

16:20.210 --> 16:24.014
Actually, this isn't
like anything.

16:24.014 --> 16:26.716
I may go to Finland
and pitch this to
the studios.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.759
Look, Bob,
watch Chase.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.923
Don't try
anything funny,

16:33.923 --> 16:35.825
or I'm gonna write
a letter to Santa

16:35.825 --> 16:37.497
and tell him
all about you.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.935
Wow, Bree.

16:45.935 --> 16:47.977
Your eyes look
really pretty today.

16:47.977 --> 16:51.711
I'm gonna rip out
your heart.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.543
You already have,
snookums.

16:53.543 --> 16:55.485
You already have.

16:58.188 --> 16:59.819
Guys.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.391
Anybody.

17:02.792 --> 17:05.625
Bob. What happened?

17:05.625 --> 17:08.198
I found Bree.
She's infected now, too.

17:08.198 --> 17:09.959
You're lucky
she didn't hurt you.

17:09.959 --> 17:11.800
Oh, she's going to.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.203
She just wants to find
a tool

17:13.203 --> 17:15.835
that will inflict
the most pain.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.268
I think this may be
the most attention

17:18.268 --> 17:20.039
she's ever given me.

17:22.571 --> 17:25.175
According to
my calculations,

17:25.175 --> 17:27.777
we have a 62% chance
of taking them out
in one shot

17:27.777 --> 17:30.150
if we can lure them all
into the pool

17:30.150 --> 17:31.781
and charge the water
with at least 100 volts
of electrical current.

17:31.781 --> 17:33.583
But whoever's wearing
rubber-soled shoes

17:33.583 --> 17:34.824
may be protected
from the shock.

17:37.387 --> 17:40.990
Stop talking, or I'm
taking you out first.

17:40.990 --> 17:42.892
Let's go get 'em.

17:47.397 --> 17:49.869
You know,

17:49.869 --> 17:51.841
when I made the virus,
I probably should've

17:51.841 --> 17:53.903
created an antidote
for it.

17:53.903 --> 17:56.806
You don't have
an antidote?

17:56.806 --> 18:00.450
No. When creating
deadly viruses,

18:00.450 --> 18:02.382
the cure is
somebody else's problem.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.887
There's no cure for what
I got for you, either.

18:07.887 --> 18:11.020
The virus has infected
their human tissue.

18:11.020 --> 18:13.263
We'd have to be surgeons
to remove it.

18:13.263 --> 18:15.064
Great. So we send Bob
to medical school,

18:15.064 --> 18:17.467
and meet back here
in 20 years.

18:17.467 --> 18:19.098
Actually, better
make it 21.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.531
I need a year
to find myself.

18:23.072 --> 18:25.835
What about Big D.'s
nano-bots?

18:25.835 --> 18:27.277
They're like
microscopic surgeons

18:27.277 --> 18:29.509
that seek out
diseased cells and destroy them.

18:29.509 --> 18:32.482
He told me he didn't
bring those to the island.

18:32.482 --> 18:34.013
That's because he didn't
want you using them

18:34.013 --> 18:35.545
to experiment on
the students.

18:35.545 --> 18:38.518
Yeah, that was
a good call.

18:41.551 --> 18:44.454
I put the nano-bots in this
high-tech tranquilizer pen.

18:44.454 --> 18:46.526
We just have to get
close enough to Bree and Chase

18:46.526 --> 18:48.057
to inject them into
their bloodstream.

18:48.057 --> 18:50.059
Let's go find them.

18:51.401 --> 18:53.163
- No need.
- ( screaming )

18:54.904 --> 18:57.006
We found you.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.986
I don't like this.

19:16.986 --> 19:19.189
I wanna be
a blank slate again.

19:23.963 --> 19:27.337
- Trick or treat!
- Adam, take 'em out!

19:27.337 --> 19:31.341
Actually, I'm gonna
take you out.

19:32.402 --> 19:34.073
Let's do it, guys.

19:36.946 --> 19:39.178
Oh, no. He must've
touched the skull, too.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.980
There's no way we can
fight off

19:40.980 --> 19:42.912
three deranged
bionic superhumans.

19:42.912 --> 19:45.555
You're right, Dooley.
We are all gonna die.

19:45.555 --> 19:48.157
You first.

19:53.863 --> 19:55.965
What just happened?

19:55.965 --> 19:58.928
I used my heat vision
to fake like I was infected

19:58.928 --> 20:01.130
so I could get
close enough to 'em

20:01.130 --> 20:02.372
to inject 'em.

20:04.574 --> 20:06.236
Good thinking.

20:06.236 --> 20:07.937
But how'd you get your skin
to look like that?

20:07.937 --> 20:09.909
Oh, I used some of
Bree's makeup.

20:09.909 --> 20:13.082
She's got some good stuff
in her purse.

20:13.082 --> 20:14.444
Smell me.

20:14.444 --> 20:16.246
It's razzleberry
body mist.

20:18.047 --> 20:20.490
Adam, I can't believe
you came up with that idea

20:20.490 --> 20:22.292
all on your own.

20:22.292 --> 20:24.294
That may be the smartest
thing he's ever done.

20:24.294 --> 20:26.656
( all agreeing )

20:26.656 --> 20:29.028
Yep, who knew it would
come down to me

20:29.028 --> 20:32.001
and this little tranquilizer
thingy to save the day?

20:41.140 --> 20:43.042
You guys really don't
remember anything

20:43.042 --> 20:45.074
about becoming possessed
and trying to destroy us?

20:45.074 --> 20:46.676
BOTH: Nope.

20:46.676 --> 20:49.078
And you don't remember
borrowing $200 from me?

20:49.078 --> 20:50.820
BOTH: Nope.

20:50.820 --> 20:52.652
Then it was 300.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.924
I don't understand
any of this.

20:54.924 --> 20:56.756
And how come there was
a potato in front of my face

20:56.756 --> 20:58.087
when I came to?

20:58.087 --> 20:59.929
It's weird.

20:59.929 --> 21:03.162
It's like its eyes
are following me.

21:03.162 --> 21:07.737
Well, it's time
to get that skull
back where it belongs.

21:07.737 --> 21:09.639
Buried with the rest
of my evil past.

21:09.639 --> 21:12.241
Now, where is it?

21:12.241 --> 21:15.305
It's right here.

21:16.506 --> 21:19.609
I'm going to
destroy you all.

21:19.609 --> 21:21.651
Merry Halloween.

21:21.651 --> 21:23.553
Come on, Bob.

21:23.553 --> 21:26.185
You know you're not
supposed to touch that.

21:26.185 --> 21:27.717
Give it to me.

21:30.960 --> 21:32.922
I'll go get
the nano-bots.
