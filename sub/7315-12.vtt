WEBVTT

00:04.037 --> 00:06.638
(dog barking, distant chatter)

00:06.640 --> 00:08.374
(man panting)

00:10.043 --> 00:11.410
Hey.
(gasps)

00:11.412 --> 00:12.277
(sighs)

00:12.279 --> 00:13.779
God, I was so worried.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.248
Man:
It's all right.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.783
I thought you wouldn't come.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.518
It's okay now.
Everything's going to be okay.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.786
Just tell me
what's going on.

00:20.788 --> 00:23.155
(buzzing)

00:23.157 --> 00:25.157
Wait.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.126
We have to get
out of here.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.194
(buzz continues)

00:30.130 --> 00:32.698
(gunshot, man grunts)

00:32.700 --> 00:35.601
(people shouting in panic)
woman: No!

00:35.603 --> 00:38.270
(crying):
Danny... Oh, danny...

00:38.272 --> 00:40.305
No.

00:40.307 --> 00:41.607
(crying)

00:41.609 --> 00:43.675
(gasping, crying)

01:18.278 --> 01:19.578
It's just really
short notice.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.580
How can you know
if you don't ask?

01:21.582 --> 01:23.248
It's not that simple.
Doesn't get

01:23.250 --> 01:24.416
Any simpler than that.

01:25.452 --> 01:26.752
(elevator buzzes)

01:26.754 --> 01:29.088
Morning.

01:29.090 --> 01:31.423
(elevator bell dings)

01:31.425 --> 01:34.359
(sighs)

01:34.361 --> 01:36.361
Got my parking space today.

01:36.363 --> 01:37.129
Oh.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.397
Oh.
(laughs)

01:38.399 --> 01:39.731
I mean, I-I know it's

01:39.733 --> 01:42.334
Only temporary,
but it's right across the street

01:42.336 --> 01:46.371
At nsa, we park off-site,
like, half a mile away.

01:46.373 --> 01:48.240
God forbid
you forgot anything.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.708
I took a picture.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.210
Want to see?

01:51.212 --> 01:52.845
Delilah:
Oh!

01:52.847 --> 01:54.546
Oh, it is a good spot.

01:54.548 --> 01:55.781
Nice.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.783
Delilah, by the way.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.818
Delilah... Fielding?

01:59.820 --> 02:01.520
Really?

02:01.522 --> 02:03.422
I-I'm... I'm ellie bishop.

02:03.424 --> 02:04.823
I'm-I'm a huge fan.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.525
You are?!

02:06.527 --> 02:09.595
Yeah. Delilah's kind of a big
deal in the analyst world, tim.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.463
Ever since
operation pin drop.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.333
Thank you.
What's operation pin drop?

02:14.335 --> 02:15.801
Can't tell you.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.703
So, are you
working here?

02:17.705 --> 02:20.506
No. Just trying
to wrap something up with tim.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.773
If by "something," you mean
a classic case of mcwaffling...

02:21.775 --> 02:23.809
Well, how would you know...?

02:23.811 --> 02:26.578
Tim butt-dialed me.
Mcgee: What?!
Oh, my god.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.313
Well, it doesn't mean
you have to listen.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.716
Oh, yes, it does.
I find you compelling, tim.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.551
So, here's the deal.

02:32.553 --> 02:36.455
By the conrad institute for
her work in counterterrorism.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.524
Congrats, by the way.
Thank you.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.893
A who's who
from the intel world.

02:40.895 --> 02:42.494
Delilah wants

02:42.496 --> 02:44.196
To bring mcgee as her plus one.

02:44.198 --> 02:45.864
But mcgee's being mcgee--
won't commit, waffling.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.399
Did I leave anything out?

02:47.401 --> 02:48.901
No, you summed it up.
Mcgee: Delilah,

02:48.903 --> 02:50.335
I don't even own a tux.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.204
A case could come down
at any moment.

02:52.206 --> 02:56.575
Who needs time off?
Mcgee. Delilah's got a big
shindig tomorrow night.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.410
No. No, I'm-I'm fine.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.279
What? You don't want to go?

03:00.281 --> 03:01.613
(phone ringing)

03:01.615 --> 03:03.348
Um... Yeah, but...

03:03.350 --> 03:04.650
Yeah, it's gibbs.

03:06.953 --> 03:08.487
(phone beeps off)

03:08.489 --> 03:09.488
Grab your gear.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.455
We've got a dead sailor

03:10.457 --> 03:11.523
In rock creek park.

03:15.295 --> 03:17.963
Hey, don't use me
as an excuse.

03:30.643 --> 03:32.778
Petty officer first class
daniel coyne.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.780
Has $72 in his wallet

03:34.782 --> 03:37.482
And a gold watch which,
according to the inscription,

03:37.484 --> 03:39.384
Was a gift from
his grandfather.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.285
Not a robbery.

03:40.287 --> 03:41.820
It's a seven millimeter.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.388
Possible sniper round.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.358
Indeed. So, our victim was shot
by a high-powered rifle.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.561
And judging by the
entrance and exit wounds,

03:49.563 --> 03:51.964
At an extremely acute angle.

03:53.499 --> 03:54.566
Suspect was in the trees?

03:54.568 --> 03:57.402
No.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.937
No, shooter was
closer than that.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.706
Yeah, and quite
a bit higher.

04:00.708 --> 04:03.542
Man: ...I walk my dog here
every morning, like clockwork.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.544
Never seen anything
like what happened today.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.612
Can you describe
what you saw?

04:06.614 --> 04:07.946
Oh, I can do you
one better.

04:07.948 --> 04:08.947
I can show you.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.016
You recorded it?
Yes, sir.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.818
Right up here.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.654
(imitates rewinding tape)

04:15.656 --> 04:16.855
(laughs)

04:16.857 --> 04:18.423
Okay.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.292
I get it.

04:21.694 --> 04:25.330
So, how long exactly has the cia
been recording your thoughts

04:25.332 --> 04:27.366
Through the fillings
in your teeth?

04:29.002 --> 04:31.937
For six years,
but they use microwaves.

04:32.905 --> 04:34.606
Yeah. I've learned
to be careful.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.608
Now, let me tell you
what happened.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.778
A gray airship
came down from the sky.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.780
Killed that man.

04:41.782 --> 04:42.914
(inhales deeply)

04:42.916 --> 04:43.949
Bishop?

04:43.951 --> 04:45.584
They were probably hunting me.

04:45.586 --> 04:46.918
Bishop, you want to hear this?

04:46.920 --> 04:49.554
Captain crazy-pants here
has a little story

04:49.556 --> 04:51.356
He wants to tell us.

04:51.358 --> 04:52.824
Um, I don't think
you're taking me seriously.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.359
Oh, no, I am.

04:54.361 --> 04:55.661
Bishop's our expert on
black helicopters. Shh.

04:55.663 --> 04:56.695
No, it <i>wasn't</i> a helicopter.

04:56.697 --> 04:57.963
It was an airship.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.299
And it was gray.
Probably alien.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.633
Like this?

05:01.635 --> 05:02.968
Yes, yes.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.037
That's it. That's the one.

05:05.039 --> 05:06.838
Bishop:
He's not crazy.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.607
Other witnesses saw it, too.

05:08.609 --> 05:11.510
Are you telling me
that an alien airship

05:11.512 --> 05:13.712
Came out of the sky
and killed this man?

05:13.714 --> 05:15.614
Not alien. U.S. Navy.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.582
This is an angelus
surveillance drone.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.885
Someone used
our own tech against us.

05:27.894 --> 05:30.329
(typing,
phones ringing in distance)

05:41.007 --> 05:42.708
Hey.

05:42.710 --> 05:46.712
So, what's going on behind
those sensitive green eyes, tim?

05:46.714 --> 05:49.381
Tony, I'm fine.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.949
You think I can't see
back there, but I can.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.117
You're insecure.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.086
(scoffs)
that is not...

05:54.088 --> 05:56.555
Because you think maybe
delilah's too good for you?

05:56.557 --> 05:57.956
Out of your league?

05:57.958 --> 05:59.524
Who knows?

05:59.526 --> 06:01.526
But here's the thing, tim.

06:01.528 --> 06:06.031
Man's reach should
exceed his grasp...

06:06.033 --> 06:08.133
Or what's a heaven for?

06:08.135 --> 06:11.036
Huh? Just something
to think about.

06:11.038 --> 06:15.006
Petty officer coyne was
stationed at nas pax river.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.875
A drone operator.
Specialized in flying

06:16.877 --> 06:18.744
The same angelus surveillance
drone that killed him.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.712
Just spoke with his c.O.
Who's expecting us.

06:20.714 --> 06:24.750
An analysis I wrote last year
on the merits of drone warfare.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.985
Redacted where necessary,
but thorough enough as a primer

06:26.987 --> 06:29.121
On the subject before
we head to pax river.

06:29.123 --> 06:31.022
I don't need any primers
on this subject, bishop.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.023
Here's where

06:32.025 --> 06:33.925
I'm the expert.
Oh, no.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.727
I know what happens
in a mechanized society

06:35.729 --> 06:37.462
When mankind gets
a little too complacent.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.064
Tony, please.

06:39.066 --> 06:43.702
When his robot helpers rise up,
seize power and overthrow us.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.937
What are you talking about?

06:45.939 --> 06:47.973
(whispering):
Skynet.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.941
No, I am not going
down this rabbit hole again.

06:49.943 --> 06:53.011
Skynet is a military
computer designed to

06:53.013 --> 06:56.014
Coordinate and control
all our weapons systems,

06:56.016 --> 06:57.582
Including our nuclear arsenal,

06:57.584 --> 06:59.718
Until it turns on us

06:59.720 --> 07:02.020
And overthrows us.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.456
So, this is a... Movie?

07:04.458 --> 07:05.791
Yeah. <i>Terminator,</i>
<i>one and two.</i>

07:05.793 --> 07:07.692
Three and four don't count.
No james cameron.

07:07.694 --> 07:10.195
Okay, uh, well, my research
is in the actual use

07:10.197 --> 07:13.899
Of unmanned aerial vehicles,
not the make-believe use.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.967
And the bottom line is,
uavs save lives.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.436
Until they turn on us.

07:19.172 --> 07:22.007
Okay, I guess that means
you're not coming to pax river.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.508
(laughing):
Oh, no.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.177
I am coming.

07:25.179 --> 07:27.446
Into the belly of the beast.

07:33.085 --> 07:34.152
What do you know, duck?

07:34.154 --> 07:36.154
Well, if our
petty officer's body

07:36.156 --> 07:40.025
Is any indication,
he was almost virtuous.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.194
Almost?
There is a woman
in his life.

07:42.196 --> 07:46.064
Well, last I heard, duck,
not a crime.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.999
Certainly not, but I
would venture to guess

07:48.001 --> 07:50.235
That she had very
expensive tastes.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.103
Take a whiff.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.073
Come on.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.142
Yeah... (sniffing)

07:58.945 --> 08:01.012
What do you smell?
Chemicals.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.147
Yeah, but beyond
the chemicals.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.483
Citrus, a note
of bergamot.

08:04.485 --> 08:07.919
Ooh, the earthy
aroma of iris.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.688
And beneath it all, vanilla.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.090
Shalimar perfume, jethro.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.025
Very exclusive.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.161
$300 an ounce.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.162
Above a petty officer's
pay grade.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.530
I know all this

08:18.532 --> 08:20.632
Because I...
I once had a dalliance

08:20.634 --> 08:23.001
With a woman
who a fondness for shalimar.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.871
She had the most
magnificent eyes.

08:25.873 --> 08:29.174
There was little I wouldn't do
when staring into those eyes.

08:29.176 --> 08:32.110
Geez, duck-- what about
the victim's girlfriend?

08:32.112 --> 08:34.246
Uh... My examination showed

08:34.248 --> 08:36.181
That the petty officer
had intercourse

08:36.183 --> 08:38.783
Shortly before his death.

08:38.785 --> 08:42.821
Whoever she is,
she might know why he's dead.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.823
Yeah, <i>cherchez la femme,</i> jethro.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.527
(sniffing)

08:48.529 --> 08:50.595
<i>Cherchez la femme.</i>

08:51.764 --> 08:54.132
Bishop:
<i>Lieutenant commander stone,</i>

08:54.134 --> 08:56.234
Are any of your drones
missing or inactive?

08:56.236 --> 08:58.937
Negative, ma'am.
All birds accounted for.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.038
(whistling)

09:00.040 --> 09:02.073
(chuckling):
Well...

09:02.075 --> 09:04.776
So, uh, any chance
one of these

09:04.778 --> 09:08.146
Becoming, you know, sentient?

09:08.148 --> 09:10.849
Every one of our drones
requires an operator

09:10.851 --> 09:13.151
And several million dollars
worth of software and equipment.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.219
They don't just,

09:14.221 --> 09:16.187
Uh, fly off on their own.

09:16.189 --> 09:19.224
Anyone in your squadron capable
of stealing one or modifying it?

09:19.226 --> 09:21.793
That would require a level
of education and ability

09:21.795 --> 09:24.162
That so far surpasses anything
they've demonstrated.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.697
They are pilots.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.299
These kids are barely
out of high school.

09:27.301 --> 09:30.335
Their biggest risk
is carpal tunnel.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.771
Not a fan of the post?
Are you kidding?

09:32.773 --> 09:34.839
I could run a full
reconnaissance mission

09:34.841 --> 09:37.275
Anywhere in the world
and still be home for dinner.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.577
It's not too shabby.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.245
Just never thought

09:40.247 --> 09:42.581
I'd have to be
a glorified hall monitor, too.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.116
What about coyne?
Was he a problem?

09:45.118 --> 09:46.284
Coyne was the exception.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.219
He's the only one
in the squadron

09:48.221 --> 09:50.121
Who's actually flown missions.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.756
My number one trainer.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.325
He had a bright future.

09:53.327 --> 09:54.793
Coyne was involved with a woman.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.227
Maybe the last person
to see him alive.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.096
It's possible
she's in the squadron?

09:58.098 --> 09:59.264
No, ma'am... It isn't.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.665
Come on, commander.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.334
You got a bunch
of randy 20-year-olds

10:02.336 --> 10:05.270
Running around here, hopped up
on caffeine and candy bars.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.607
May look like
a, uh, college dorm out there,

10:08.609 --> 10:10.642
But this is still
the u.S. Navy.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.378
And there's absolutely
no fraternizing in my squadron.

10:14.347 --> 10:17.082
Danny's dead?

10:21.053 --> 10:23.054
Bishop:
<i>Coyne was seeing petty officer</i>

10:23.056 --> 10:24.723
First class
patrice gates.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.224
They bonded
over a shared love

10:26.226 --> 10:27.993
For kettle corn and
home improvement shows.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.995
He snuck into her quarters
on a nightly basis,

10:29.997 --> 10:31.963
And she flew his drone.
Gates claims

10:31.965 --> 10:34.132
They were getting married
when her enlistment ended.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.968
Claims?
Well, patrice has no appetite
for the finer things in life.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.403
She buys her beauty
supplies in bulk,

10:38.405 --> 10:41.272
And they don't sell shalimar
at the local megamart.

10:41.274 --> 10:44.142
Coyne was knocking headboards
with somebody else.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.345
Tony: She doesn't have a clue
coyne was cheating on her.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.147
Or the technical know-how
to operate a drone,

10:49.149 --> 10:53.218
Who does?
Only people familiar enough
with the drone's system

10:53.220 --> 10:55.286
Would be the contractors
who built them.
Okay.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.722
Let's talk to 'em.
Well, that's gonna be
a bit of a problem.

10:57.724 --> 11:00.225
See, the company is
reinhart-carion.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.292
I went to go run
a background check

11:01.294 --> 11:03.294
On their employees
and was turned away.

11:03.296 --> 11:06.097
Turns out reinhart-carion
is already under investigation

11:06.099 --> 11:07.265
By the dod.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.433
Whoever is running
that investigation,

11:08.435 --> 11:09.668
I want them in here.

11:11.437 --> 11:13.705
Delilah...?

11:14.740 --> 11:16.341
This is not a good time.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.308
I'm not here to see you.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.677
Then who?

11:18.679 --> 11:19.444
Me.

11:21.414 --> 11:24.015
If that's okay with you,
special agent mcgee.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.887
Gibbs, you, too.

11:32.158 --> 11:34.993
Drone strike six months ago
in pakistan wilderness.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.795
Terrorist camp belonging to

11:36.797 --> 11:38.797
Benham parsa.
Our response
for the bombing

11:38.799 --> 11:40.799
That killed secnav
last year.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.968
Mission was a success,
though parsa escaped.

11:43.970 --> 11:47.405
What's this got to do
with my dead petty officer?

11:47.407 --> 11:49.140
Coyne was part
of the kill chain.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.009
He flew the angelus
surveillance drone

11:51.011 --> 11:53.478
That positively confirmed
parsa was present.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.380
His uav went down
during the strike--

11:55.382 --> 11:56.448
Mechanical failure.

11:56.450 --> 11:57.849
Defense believes

11:57.851 --> 12:00.351
That parsa or his people
may have recovered

12:00.353 --> 12:02.353
The uav,
smuggled it stateside.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.355
And used it against coyne
as retaliation for this attack?

12:04.357 --> 12:07.158
There's been chatter for days
he's making a move in the u.S.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.460
You and I both know
parsa's not gonna go through

12:08.462 --> 12:10.495
All this trouble just
to kill one man.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.164
There'll be more attacks.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.200
(phone rings)

12:17.237 --> 12:19.237
Mcgee:
Director, I need to speak

12:19.239 --> 12:21.306
With gibbs.
It's mcgee.

12:24.343 --> 12:25.410
Hey.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.479
Did you find
the dod investigator?

12:27.481 --> 12:28.747
Not exactly.

12:28.749 --> 12:31.349
Before I could, she found us.

12:33.285 --> 12:34.819
Boss, I had no idea.

12:34.821 --> 12:36.421
If I did,
I would've warned you.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.422
Warned me about what?

12:37.424 --> 12:39.124
About me.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.792
Hey, jethro.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.497
It's not another one
of your ex-wives, is it?

12:49.969 --> 12:52.036
Close enough.

13:03.048 --> 13:05.183
You two know each other?

13:05.185 --> 13:06.217
Uh-huh.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.285
It's been a few years.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.286
Gibbs:
Why are you here,

13:08.288 --> 13:10.288
Hollis?
I was brought on

13:10.290 --> 13:12.290
By the dod to run
an internal investigation

13:12.292 --> 13:15.326
Into reinhart-carion.
Vance: The defense contractors

13:15.328 --> 13:17.462
Who built and maintain
the drones at nas

13:17.464 --> 13:18.797
Pax river?
Hollis: Mm-hmm.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.299
Reinhart's computer systems
were hacked.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.368
When?
A month ago.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.537
And you kept this to yourself.
That would be

13:25.539 --> 13:27.839
The definition of "internal,"
jethro.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.141
It's...

13:30.143 --> 13:32.877
Our belief
that a navy angelus uav

13:32.879 --> 13:37.182
Was compromised, rewired and
used to kill a u.S. Drone pilot.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.249
By who?
Gibbs:
Nah.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.350
You first.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.453
Any suspects on your theft?
We have...

13:42.455 --> 13:44.022
One suspect.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.323
A reinhart employee.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.859
Erin pace.

13:47.861 --> 13:50.495
She's a highly trained computer
programmer and engineer.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.931
She's been mia
for several days--

13:52.933 --> 13:54.399
Not at work, not at home,

13:54.401 --> 13:57.001
And she's absolutely capable
of reconfiguring a drone

13:57.003 --> 13:58.369
In the way you describe.

13:59.371 --> 14:01.606
Your turn.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.908
Okay.

14:03.910 --> 14:05.243
We'll get back to you.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.377
That's not the deal.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.378
Didn't make a deal.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.214
This is my investigation.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.515
It was.

14:10.517 --> 14:14.285
I was appointed by the inspector
general to see it through.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.054
Don't make me go
above your head.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.388
Hollis, my boss is right here.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.389
Keep me out of it.
I'm talking

14:18.391 --> 14:21.125
About his boss
and his boss's boss.

14:21.127 --> 14:22.594
I've got them all on speed dial.

14:22.596 --> 14:24.896
We need
to work together,

14:24.898 --> 14:26.464
However hard
that might be for you.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.333
No. Not gonna happen.

14:30.636 --> 14:32.470
(phone beeps)

14:32.472 --> 14:33.471
(sighs with annoyance)

14:33.473 --> 14:35.306
Hollis mann.

14:35.308 --> 14:38.376
Yep. They're being,
uh, resistant.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.246
You sure she's not
an ex-wife, gibbs?

14:41.248 --> 14:43.514
He'd like to speak with you.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.520
This is vance.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.490
Yes, mr. Secretary.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.492
A joint investigation.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.394
Understood.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.330
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.466
That was the
secretary of defense.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.201
She's in, gibbs.

15:06.372 --> 15:08.106
Hollis mann.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.508
What does it mean?

15:10.510 --> 15:14.212
Uh, we still have a dead petty
officer and a missing drone.

15:14.214 --> 15:17.282
Shouldn't we be,
you know, investigating?

15:17.284 --> 15:19.651
You have your earbuds
and chess metaphors.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.486
We have this; don't knock it.

15:21.488 --> 15:24.455
Up there arguing
over jurisdiction.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.924
Their version of foreplay.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.592
So, who is hollis mann?

15:27.594 --> 15:28.993
Penetrating question, bishop.

15:28.995 --> 15:31.062
She was supposed
to be gibbs' fourth ex-wife.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.431
Fourth? (laughs)

15:33.433 --> 15:34.565
How many does he have?

15:34.567 --> 15:36.167
Well, there was only
the one real wife.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.402
Then there's the exes.

15:37.404 --> 15:40.405
Keep it simple, mcgee.
Exes only.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.407
(quietly):
Let's do the thing.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.609
All right.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.311
On three.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.313
When I give you the all clear.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.381
Coast is clear. Let's do this.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.050
One, two, three. Put it up.

15:53.552 --> 15:56.421
Ex-wife number one, diane.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.556
Satan's spawn, first sign
of the apocalypse.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.224
You've met her.
Tim slept with her.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.560
Emphasis on "slept."
then there's stephanie,

16:02.562 --> 16:04.395
Ex number three.
(purrs)

16:04.397 --> 16:06.531
She matches diane
in personality and charm.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.333
What about ex-wife number two?

16:08.335 --> 16:11.069
Tony: Sort of a gibbsian
bermuda triangle.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.036
And hollis mann?

16:12.038 --> 16:13.104
That's the one that got away.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.639
Mcgee:
Gibbs met her on a case.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.007
Army cid. Total pro.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.576
And no discernible
personality disorders.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.278
Pretty soon it was late nights
down in the basement,

16:20.280 --> 16:21.412
Looking good and then...

16:21.414 --> 16:23.281
Hollis... Gone.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.049
She retired from the army.
Moved to hawaii.

16:25.051 --> 16:27.218
We read about it
in <i>stars and stripes.</i>

16:27.220 --> 16:30.054
Tony: No harassing phone calls,
no viking funerals, just...

16:30.056 --> 16:32.056
Gone.

16:32.058 --> 16:33.558
They broke up, clearly.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.760
No, there's
no way of knowing.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.028
There's one way.
You could just ask.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.029
Gibbs:
Ask me what?

16:38.031 --> 16:38.696
Hi. Uh, yeah.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.565
No, nothing. I could.

16:40.567 --> 16:41.699
Why don't
you call me back?

16:41.701 --> 16:43.267
Erin pace.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.702
May be involved in
the drone attack.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.037
Locate her.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.206
Um...
Benham parsa? Right?

16:49.141 --> 16:50.675
Yeah?
What do you know about him?

16:50.677 --> 16:52.777
Uh... (sputters) um...

16:52.779 --> 16:54.145
Uh, what do you...
What do you need?

16:54.147 --> 16:55.480
Early life and education?

16:55.482 --> 16:57.281
Uh, radicalization?

16:57.283 --> 16:59.150
Current activities
and correspondence...

16:59.152 --> 17:00.551
All of it.

17:03.622 --> 17:07.025
Oh, hey, gibbs.
I heard. She's back.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.626
Does she look the same?
Did you guys get to talk?

17:08.628 --> 17:10.228
Was it totally awkward?

17:10.230 --> 17:12.497
It is now.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.400
Oh... (chuckles)

17:15.402 --> 17:17.502
Hey there... (chuckles)

17:17.504 --> 17:19.504
You could've told me, gibbs.
Didn't give me
a chance, abbs.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.639
It's good
to see you, abby.
It's good to see you, too.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.641
I'm just gonna,
uh, take my foot

17:23.643 --> 17:26.577
Out of my mouth so we can talk
about what I've got.

17:26.579 --> 17:30.114
Yes. I had my office forward you
the evidence we pulled

17:30.116 --> 17:35.053
Every hairbrush and coffee cup
and paper clip that she owned.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.821
We like to
be thorough.
You find anything?

17:36.823 --> 17:38.556
I found shalimar perfume.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.059
It matches the traces that ducky
found on coyne's skin.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.528
Wait, your victim was
sleeping with my suspect?

17:43.530 --> 17:46.431
Or at least involved
in some very heavy petting.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.299
But I also found this.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.168
Gibbs:
Orange juice?
Yep.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.136
I already had my people
run it for prints.

17:52.138 --> 17:54.405
Only found pace's.
I, too, like
to be very thorough,

17:54.407 --> 17:57.108
So I swabbed the spout for dna.
Got a hit.

17:57.110 --> 18:00.645
Meet... Yusef ryder.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.647
He served multiple sentences
at multiple prisons

18:02.649 --> 18:04.182
For multiple
violent crimes.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.117
He was most recently
an inmate at jessup

18:06.119 --> 18:08.186
Correctional institution,

18:08.188 --> 18:10.421
Where he officially converted
to islam.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.790
I mean, he sounds
just like

18:12.792 --> 18:16.194
The kind of guy that benham
parsa would <i>love</i> to recruit.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.595
He doesn't exactly have
the background

18:17.597 --> 18:18.830
To operate
and maintain a drone.

18:18.832 --> 18:20.465
No, but he does have
a background

18:20.467 --> 18:22.467
In kidnapping and
aggravated assault.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.335
What, you think that
he coerced erin pace?

18:24.337 --> 18:26.404
I think if we find him,
we find out.

18:27.539 --> 18:31.109
Yusef ryder skipped parole
two weeks ago,

18:31.111 --> 18:32.610
Dropped off the map
until Monday,

18:32.612 --> 18:35.146
When he was caught on video
camera robbing a gun store.

18:35.148 --> 18:38.382
Including a high-powered rifle
that matches

18:38.384 --> 18:40.384
The make and model
used to kill coyne.

18:40.386 --> 18:42.286
Fled in a stolen van.

18:42.288 --> 18:46.157
At a motel parking lot
near falls church

18:46.159 --> 18:47.325
About ten minutes ago.

18:47.327 --> 18:48.593
They're babysitting
till we get there.

18:48.595 --> 18:49.627
Let's roll.

18:52.197 --> 18:55.199
Manager said that yusef
checked in two days ago,

18:55.201 --> 18:56.734
Using an assumed identity.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.402
Room's in the back.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.605
Mcgee and I are gonna
check it out now.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.673
Got eyes on the van.

19:11.383 --> 19:13.451
All right, we need to talk.

19:15.587 --> 19:16.921
About what?

19:16.923 --> 19:18.689
About this.

19:18.691 --> 19:21.425
You haven't said a word to me
since we got in the car, jethro.

19:21.427 --> 19:22.693
It's been six years.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.829
You must have something to say.

19:26.598 --> 19:29.600
No. No, I'm good.

19:29.602 --> 19:33.704
You want to talk,
you should ride with dinozzo.

19:38.744 --> 19:41.679
How was hawaii?

19:42.648 --> 19:45.249
It was beautiful.

19:45.251 --> 19:48.586
And... Boring.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.254
Hmm.

19:50.256 --> 19:52.523
Only so many perfect days
a woman can take.

19:52.525 --> 19:56.527
I... Just had
to get back to work.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.663
I got married.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.531
Mm-hmm.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.867
That happens.
No, it's not like that.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.736
He's a good guy. He's...

20:05.738 --> 20:07.738
A doctor at walter reed.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.740
Trauma surgeon. I...

20:09.742 --> 20:13.477
Met him two years ago,
right after I got back.

20:15.647 --> 20:18.983
I would have called you,
but I...

20:20.652 --> 20:21.819
Yeah...

20:21.821 --> 20:24.789
You're right.
Silence is better.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.791
Tony: Room's empty, gibbs,
but the van just started moving.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.327
Ten bucks says
he didn't get far.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.995
No.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.863
Not far.

20:48.947 --> 20:50.615
(van creaking)

20:52.884 --> 20:54.018
Yusef ryder!

20:54.020 --> 20:55.453
Federal agents!

21:00.425 --> 21:04.795
(muffled crying)

21:10.435 --> 21:11.702
You're okay,

21:11.704 --> 21:12.703
And you are safe.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.905
I'm not. I'm not safe.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.308
None of us are.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.455
He kidnapped me,

21:31.457 --> 21:33.791
Took me
to this storage building.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.726
(sniffles)
there were other men.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.361
How many?
Three.

21:37.363 --> 21:38.863
Maybe more.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.464
Pakistani.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.500
One of them
spoke english.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.435
He was different.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.003
He spoke perfectly.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.072
Like, proper english,
almost british.

21:48.074 --> 21:50.408
Um... Polite.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.876
Almost reasonable,
like he was

21:51.878 --> 21:53.477
On my side.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.415
He had an angelus uav.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.750
They wanted you to modify it.

22:00.719 --> 22:01.886
I refused...

22:01.888 --> 22:03.554
At first.

22:03.556 --> 22:08.526
The polite one pulled out
a laptop with a live video feed.

22:10.762 --> 22:12.663
It was my husband,

22:12.665 --> 22:14.432
Asleep in bed.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.967
He works for an ngo in mali.

22:16.969 --> 22:19.036
Somehow they had
a camera on him.

22:21.106 --> 22:22.907
I did everything
they said after that.

22:22.909 --> 22:25.076
And petty officer coyne?

22:25.078 --> 22:26.644
Were you close?

22:27.479 --> 22:30.915
No, we worked together.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.950
They forced me
to get him to the park.

22:32.952 --> 22:33.951
You were the bait.

22:33.953 --> 22:35.353
Yeah.

22:37.089 --> 22:39.990
I-I didn't mean to get...

22:39.992 --> 22:41.992
I mean,
I never would, uh...

22:41.994 --> 22:44.862
(sniffles) I did...
I-I didn't have a choice.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.465
Erin, no one's
saying you did.

22:47.467 --> 22:50.034
Gibbs: Coyne's murder
was a test run.

22:51.470 --> 22:53.371
Who's next?

22:54.940 --> 22:57.942
Someone important-- I heard
them whispering about it.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.710
(sniffles)
something about...

22:59.712 --> 23:02.580
Revenge for an attack
in pakistan.

23:02.582 --> 23:05.416
It was hard
to make out, but...

23:05.418 --> 23:07.818
I picked up a word.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.787
It didn't make
much sense.

23:11.022 --> 23:12.823
Acrobat.

23:12.825 --> 23:14.725
Acrobat?

23:14.727 --> 23:15.860
Are you sure?

23:16.762 --> 23:18.095
It's a secret service

23:18.097 --> 23:20.431
Code name for
joint base andrews.

23:20.433 --> 23:21.999
Erin, I-I know
you're tired.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.968
But I need to ask you
about this man,

23:23.970 --> 23:26.103
Uh, the polite one?

23:29.775 --> 23:31.108
Is this him?

23:38.183 --> 23:40.050
Vance:
<i>Benham parsa</i>

23:40.052 --> 23:41.152
Is in the country?

23:42.454 --> 23:43.654
That's what erin pace said.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.923
How do you know it was him?

23:45.925 --> 23:47.158
The way erin
described him, uh...

23:47.160 --> 23:48.993
Soft-spoken, proper english,
good manners.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.529
All habits he picked up
in the international
school he attended.

23:51.531 --> 23:54.532
Why did he come?
We used a
hellfire missile

23:54.534 --> 23:56.567
To destroy his compound
in pakistan.

23:56.569 --> 23:57.868
Maybe he feels safer here.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.870
He's not.
Vance:
Secretary of defense

23:59.872 --> 24:02.540
Is scheduled to meet with
several world leaders

24:02.542 --> 24:04.875
At joint base andrews tomorrow.

24:04.877 --> 24:06.944
Hollis mann is coordinating
with secret service

24:06.946 --> 24:08.979
To relocate that event.
Parsa doesn't know that.

24:08.981 --> 24:11.115
Gives us a day to track him
and the stolen uav.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.583
Go to it.

24:16.988 --> 24:18.989
Delilah. Hey.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.791
You here to see
director vance again?

24:20.793 --> 24:22.460
No. You, this time.

24:22.462 --> 24:23.694
Brought you something.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.162
What is it?

24:25.164 --> 24:26.964
Tuxedo.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.699
I know you don't have one.

24:37.676 --> 24:39.510
It's really nice.

24:42.714 --> 24:43.914
Look, delilah...

24:43.916 --> 24:45.216
Oh, I know you can't come.

24:45.218 --> 24:47.618
Parsa's out there,
national security, I get it.

24:47.620 --> 24:48.919
Can't return
the tux, though,

24:48.921 --> 24:50.221
I already had it tailored.

24:50.223 --> 24:53.090
I'm a cryptologist
for the department of defense,

24:53.092 --> 24:55.693
I think I can figure out
my boyfriend's inseam.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.096
(laughs quietly)

24:59.098 --> 25:01.632
Delilah.

25:01.634 --> 25:04.168
I'm sorry, okay?

25:04.170 --> 25:05.970
No, I understand, tim. I do.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.271
This is important.

25:08.974 --> 25:10.207
But I know you
never really wanted

25:10.209 --> 25:12.109
To come to the gala with me.

25:14.145 --> 25:17.181
And that I just
can't understand.

25:23.922 --> 25:25.789
(elevator bell chimes)

25:29.294 --> 25:30.694
(bishop sighs)

25:30.696 --> 25:31.829
No.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.197
No, this is wrong.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.666
Well, you said diet.
Not the soda.
Parsa, it...

25:35.668 --> 25:37.868
It's too small for him.
Tony:
Too small?

25:37.870 --> 25:40.104
He smuggled a remote control
assassin into the country

25:40.106 --> 25:42.039
To pick off international vips.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.574
He's a blunt instrument,
not a surgeon.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.743
He doesn't whisper,
h-he... He bellows.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.244
Cairo, 2007.
He detonated

25:47.246 --> 25:48.846
A bomb inside a passenger train.

25:48.848 --> 25:49.914
Killed 30.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.315
The indian ocean, 2008.

25:51.317 --> 25:54.218
He sabotaged a french
cargo ship-- 15 dead.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.954
Bahrain, two years ago.
He took 20 people

25:56.956 --> 25:59.557
Hostage inside a luxury hotel.
He-he killed them all.

25:59.559 --> 26:01.692
Got to be a hoot at parties.
Parsa doesn't
go to parties.

26:01.694 --> 26:04.762
He doesn't drink, smoke, date--
h-he spends all of his time

26:04.764 --> 26:07.197
Planning and executing
his attacks.
Okay.

26:07.199 --> 26:09.733
Why don't we all just
take a deep breath.

26:09.735 --> 26:11.101
We <i>can</i> work with
what we have.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.571
Which is a multi-million dollar
navy robot

26:13.573 --> 26:16.740
The size of a car-- can't be all
that easy fly, let alone hide.

26:16.742 --> 26:19.209
Mcgee: Designed for stealth,
flies under the radar.

26:19.211 --> 26:20.578
Could be stored
in a garage.

26:20.580 --> 26:22.212
Got to be a way to trace it.

26:22.214 --> 26:23.747
They're usually operated
from halfway around the world

26:23.749 --> 26:25.149
Using military satellites.

26:26.284 --> 26:28.953
Parsa doesn't have
those kind of resources.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.187
Mcgee:
No, and that's why he had

26:30.189 --> 26:32.022
Erin pace rewire it.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.791
He doesn't need it
to be long range,

26:33.793 --> 26:36.193
He's close by, which means
piggybacking off a local system.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.695
I can work with that.

26:37.697 --> 26:39.263
He can work with that.

26:43.234 --> 26:45.135
Hollis:
The world as we know it

26:45.137 --> 26:47.338
Is falling apart
all around us...

26:47.340 --> 26:49.607
And you're down here.

26:51.009 --> 26:53.077
I'm not at all surprised.

26:56.781 --> 26:59.249
I brought dinner.

26:59.251 --> 27:00.918
I already ate.

27:03.321 --> 27:06.056
In that case...

27:06.058 --> 27:07.391
Dessert.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.161
Small batch.

27:11.163 --> 27:12.696
Very smooth.

27:13.898 --> 27:15.165
Thank you.

27:22.207 --> 27:26.243
It's been a long time since
I've been down in this basement.

27:26.245 --> 27:29.279
Kind of pulled
the whole room together.

27:29.281 --> 27:30.914
(tool clanks onto workbench)

27:33.685 --> 27:34.885
What are you doing?

27:34.887 --> 27:36.186
I'm trying to make peace.

27:36.188 --> 27:37.721
We're good.
Good?

27:37.723 --> 27:40.357
Really? Because it kind of feels

27:40.359 --> 27:41.725
The exact opposite.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.995
What do you want
from me, hollis?

27:44.997 --> 27:46.130
I want to apologize.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.198
There's no need.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.433
Oh, stop that.

27:49.435 --> 27:51.068
God, I forgot how

27:51.070 --> 27:53.137
Infuriating you could be.

27:53.139 --> 27:54.204
(laughs)

27:54.206 --> 27:55.406
Was that the apology?

27:55.408 --> 27:56.974
No.

27:56.976 --> 27:59.343
No, this is. I...

27:59.345 --> 28:00.911
I liked you, okay?

28:00.913 --> 28:02.980
I <i>really</i> liked you.

28:02.982 --> 28:05.249
And what happened
between us, it was good.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.818
It was great, even.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.889
But there was a wall
that wasn't coming down.

28:13.324 --> 28:15.693
Your past.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.129
And I could see
what was gonna happen.

28:19.131 --> 28:21.198
How bad it was gonna get.

28:22.167 --> 28:25.836
Me, trying to...
Pull things from you,

28:25.838 --> 28:27.404
And you not ready to let go.

28:29.941 --> 28:32.843
So I made an executive
decision-- I left...

28:34.145 --> 28:35.412
...So that...

28:35.414 --> 28:38.916
We could remember the good.

28:40.151 --> 28:42.152
You should have just asked.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.458
(sighs)

28:48.727 --> 28:51.328
I'm sorry, jethro.

28:57.769 --> 28:59.369
Hey, hey...

29:03.141 --> 29:05.209
(coins clinking, clattering)

29:30.168 --> 29:31.335
Mcgee:
<i>With parsa's piggybacking</i>

29:31.337 --> 29:33.170
Off of local radio towers,

29:33.172 --> 29:34.772
It'll be low-frequency,
low-volume providers.

29:34.774 --> 29:37.307
I checked every
college radio station

29:37.309 --> 29:39.243
In dc, virginia
and maryland.

29:39.245 --> 29:40.844
Well, we still
got to keep looking.

29:42.013 --> 29:43.280
So...

29:43.515 --> 29:44.782
Delilah.

29:44.784 --> 29:45.983
Not you, too.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.184
Ugh.

29:47.186 --> 29:48.886
Look, I didn't have a choice.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.788
I can't go to the awards gala
with her.

29:50.790 --> 29:51.989
I feel bad, okay?
It just...

29:51.991 --> 29:53.924
Seemed like you...

29:53.926 --> 29:55.826
Didn't really want to go.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.027
I didn't.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.128
Mcgee!

29:58.130 --> 29:59.396
I thought you
really liked her!

29:59.398 --> 30:00.798
I did.

30:00.800 --> 30:01.832
I do.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.967
We're together
all the time,

30:03.969 --> 30:05.269
Which is nice.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.538
We went on a trip together.

30:07.540 --> 30:09.973
She leaves clothes
at my apartment.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.942
She bought me a tuxedo.

30:11.944 --> 30:15.012
I mean, that's a little much,
don't you think? Too much.

30:15.014 --> 30:17.915
I think I just need
to slow things down.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.483
I need... Space.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.822
Hey.
Oh, boo-hoo.

30:24.824 --> 30:27.424
"my super-hot,
super-smart girlfriend

30:27.426 --> 30:28.959
Likes me too much?"

30:28.961 --> 30:32.029
Mcgee, this is
not about space.

30:32.031 --> 30:34.331
It's about you being scared.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.567
You're scared that things
aren't going to work out,

30:36.569 --> 30:37.968
And somebody's
gonna get hurt,

30:37.970 --> 30:39.469
And then you have
to deal with those

30:39.471 --> 30:41.905
Messy emotions.

30:41.907 --> 30:43.874
Delilah is, like,
the best thing

30:43.876 --> 30:45.108
That's ever
happened to you.

30:45.110 --> 30:47.110
You can't protect yourself
from everything.

30:47.112 --> 30:49.279
(beeping)

30:49.281 --> 30:52.249
Oh, picking up something here.

30:52.251 --> 30:55.252
A signal from the emergency
broadcast system tower.

30:55.254 --> 30:58.222
Yeah, but this
is a second carrier wave,

30:58.224 --> 30:59.990
It's not broadcasting anything.

30:59.992 --> 31:01.291
Do you have
the signal origin?

31:01.293 --> 31:02.993
Triangulating.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.261
Looks like some kind of

31:04.263 --> 31:07.197
Just like erin pace described.

31:13.605 --> 31:15.973
Tony: Got eyes on yusef;
no sign of the others.

31:15.975 --> 31:17.975
We take the drone,
we take yusef.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.109
Alive, if possible.

31:19.111 --> 31:20.377
He's our link
to parsa.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.014
You stick
to dinozzo.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.215
I aced tactical
weapons training,

31:25.217 --> 31:26.483
I can take care
of myself.

31:26.485 --> 31:28.218
I know, bishop.
Stick to dinozzo.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.486
(sighs)

31:38.463 --> 31:40.063
Stick to me.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.371
Ncis!

31:49.407 --> 31:51.074
(rapid gunfire)

31:52.277 --> 31:54.144
(grunts)

32:02.053 --> 32:03.253
Whoa...

32:09.427 --> 32:11.061
(bishop gasping)

32:11.063 --> 32:12.129
Lucky shot?

32:22.206 --> 32:25.342
Bishop: My first time.
M-my first time I fire a weapon.

32:25.344 --> 32:28.211
I mean, most agents never
even fire a weapon in anger.

32:28.213 --> 32:30.314
Me, I blow up
a building.

32:30.316 --> 32:31.682
Well, it was...

32:31.684 --> 32:33.717
Kind of a smallish building.

32:33.719 --> 32:36.186
Do you know how much
trouble I'm in?

32:36.188 --> 32:39.690
Forget the fact I took out a
multimillion-dollar navy drone,

32:39.692 --> 32:43.694
I... I killed our
one link to parsa.

32:44.662 --> 32:46.596
No.

32:46.598 --> 32:48.298
You didn't.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.033
This did.
What?

32:50.035 --> 32:52.536
It's the detonator

32:52.538 --> 32:54.738
That set off the explosives
inside the storage building.

32:54.740 --> 32:57.207
It's probably c-4-- it'll
take me some time to confirm.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.642
Yusef martyred himself?

32:58.644 --> 33:01.378
And you did your job.

33:01.380 --> 33:04.014
Well, we're still
no closer to finding parsa.

33:04.016 --> 33:04.982
Come on.

33:06.317 --> 33:09.453
You're a puzzle solver.
Bishop (groans):
Oh, this...

33:09.455 --> 33:13.156
Isn't like any other puzzle
I've ever solved.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.192
That's why you just
have to stay organized.

33:15.194 --> 33:17.728
Um, so I've split all
this stuff up into quadrants.

33:17.730 --> 33:19.396
The first one
is bomb components,

33:19.398 --> 33:21.031
The second one is drone parts,

33:21.033 --> 33:22.733
And the third
is just miscellaneous.

33:22.735 --> 33:25.402
(exhales)
ah, thanks.

33:25.404 --> 33:28.705
Okay, so, like this,
this would be

33:28.707 --> 33:31.708
Our left wing thruster

33:31.710 --> 33:34.311
From our angelus uav.

33:40.651 --> 33:42.119
Mcgee!

33:43.121 --> 33:45.489
You look like the top
of a wedding cake.

33:45.491 --> 33:47.557
Thank you, I think.
So you're going

33:47.559 --> 33:48.492
To the conrad gala?

33:48.494 --> 33:49.693
Well, the immediate threat

33:49.695 --> 33:53.296
I know delilah wants me there,
so I'm going.

33:53.298 --> 33:57.501
I would hug you so much
right now, if I weren't...

33:57.503 --> 33:59.803
Covered in hazardous materials.

34:03.775 --> 34:06.176
Abby, thank you.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.418
Okay, next piece.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.286
This one...

34:16.288 --> 34:18.822
(elevator bell chimes)

34:18.824 --> 34:22.426
...Is also the
left wing thruster.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.361
Gibbs:
<i>What are you telling me, abby?</i>

34:24.363 --> 34:26.363
We went through
each and every part, gibbs.

34:26.365 --> 34:30.367
There's two left thrusters,
a couple of rusted-out axles,

34:30.369 --> 34:33.570
And a mangled motherboard--
I mean, none of it connects.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.838
It's spare parts.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.407
It's, like,
pieces from old drones

34:37.409 --> 34:39.509
That have been decommissioned
for years.
The serial numbers

34:39.511 --> 34:42.679
Don't even match each other,
let alone the angelus that
went down in pakistan.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.849
The c-4 from the storage unit,
it was supposed to go off.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.184
The trigger from the bomb

34:47.186 --> 34:48.785
Used a radio signal.
Yusef probably

34:48.787 --> 34:50.787
Meant to set the bomb off
after he left,

34:50.789 --> 34:52.422
But changed his mind
when he saw he was cornered.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.724
Parsa wanted us to think
that the drone was destroyed.

34:54.726 --> 34:57.094
(phone ringing)
so the drone's still out there.

34:58.863 --> 35:00.530
Yeah, ducky?

35:00.532 --> 35:03.200
Our victim is not
what he seems, jethro.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.135
Yeah, been hearing
that a lot lately.

35:05.137 --> 35:07.337
When I was examining him
just now, I noticed

35:07.339 --> 35:09.806
A crescent moon tattoo
on his palm.

35:09.808 --> 35:13.143
The crude design
and improvised metallic ink

35:13.145 --> 35:15.378
Suggest that it was
acquired in prison.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.714
A symbol of
his conversion to islam.

35:17.716 --> 35:20.650
Yes, but it also piqued my
interest in his other tattoos.

35:20.652 --> 35:24.588
This dagger here
represents la vida mala,

35:24.590 --> 35:27.390
And this one percent
tat on his arm

35:27.392 --> 35:30.494
With the vandals
motorcycle club,

35:30.496 --> 35:32.863
And several other
unpleasant organizations.

35:32.865 --> 35:35.799
Yusef got around.
Well, it all suggests

35:35.801 --> 35:37.667
That this man
was quite mercenary

35:37.669 --> 35:39.636
In his affiliations,

35:39.638 --> 35:41.505
Joining all these groups

35:41.507 --> 35:43.406
Not for philosophic reasons,

35:43.408 --> 35:46.143
But because they offered
protection in prison,

35:46.145 --> 35:48.211
And employment on the outside.

35:48.213 --> 35:50.881
Yusef here is a survivor.

35:50.883 --> 35:56.419
Not the type of man willing
to martyr himself for a cause.

35:56.421 --> 35:58.221
Not a suicide bomber.

35:58.223 --> 35:59.189
Precisely.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.225
Someone else detonated the bomb

36:02.227 --> 36:03.860
At the storage facility.
Mm-hmm.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.695
Parsa played us.

36:05.697 --> 36:07.731
Well, benham parsa
is the type of man

36:07.733 --> 36:10.834
Who revels in deceit
and misdirection.

36:10.836 --> 36:13.803
Nothing is ever what it seems.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.740
Erin:
<i>Why am I</i>

36:16.742 --> 36:18.208
In an interrogation room?

36:18.210 --> 36:19.709
Main objective
is to unsettle you.

36:19.711 --> 36:20.777
Okay... Well, it-it's working.

36:20.779 --> 36:23.180
(nervous laugh)

36:23.182 --> 36:24.548
Terrific.
How's your marriage?

36:24.550 --> 36:26.716
I... It's fine.

36:26.718 --> 36:28.785
You helped america's
most wanted terrorist

36:28.787 --> 36:31.488
Design a weapon because your
husband was being threatened.

36:31.490 --> 36:34.758
I hope your marriage is doing
a little better than fine.

36:34.760 --> 36:35.926
It's good, all right?
Bishop:
You haven't seen

36:35.928 --> 36:37.527
Your husband in 11 months.

36:37.529 --> 36:38.828
Well, he works overseas.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.197
You haven't spoken,
e-mailed, facebook'd

36:40.199 --> 36:41.865
Or even written a postcard.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.800
How do you...
Maybe you're estranged
because your husband

36:43.802 --> 36:46.970
Left you saddled with hundreds
of thousands of dollars in debt.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.538
Gambling, right?

36:48.540 --> 36:50.507
I don't know what this is.
You're underwater,

36:50.509 --> 36:51.841
Desperate for money,

36:51.843 --> 36:55.245
He didn't have
to threaten you,
like you claimed.

36:55.247 --> 36:57.881
Had to be a lot
to betray your country.

36:57.883 --> 37:00.217
And petty officer coyne.

37:00.219 --> 37:02.319
You told parsa coyne
was involved in the drone attack

37:02.321 --> 37:03.653
And took out his compound.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.956
You basically signed
his death warrant.

37:05.958 --> 37:08.258
Since you've looked
at my correspondence

37:08.260 --> 37:10.560
And my finances, you
know I haven't received

37:10.562 --> 37:12.229
A penny from anyone.

37:12.231 --> 37:14.598
(sighs)
tell us about palm ridge.

37:18.269 --> 37:22.005
It's the assisted-living
facility where my sister is.

37:22.007 --> 37:25.008
She was hurt...
In a car accident in college.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.911
Traumatic brain injury.
She's been there ever since.

37:27.913 --> 37:28.979
Your parents set up a trust

37:28.981 --> 37:31.314
To take care
of her living expenses.

37:31.316 --> 37:33.583
You're the executor.
And three days ago,

37:33.585 --> 37:36.486
That trust received an infusion
of cash-- $5 million.

37:36.488 --> 37:38.255
Now, listen, erin,

37:38.257 --> 37:40.423
Either your sister...

37:40.425 --> 37:43.627
In her catatonic state, somehow
colluded with benham parsa

37:43.629 --> 37:45.595
To commit high treason, or...

37:45.597 --> 37:46.930
You did.

37:48.966 --> 37:51.534
They beat me, you know.

37:52.670 --> 37:55.572
Tied me up.

37:55.574 --> 37:58.275
I'm a victim.
Bishop:
No.

37:58.277 --> 38:01.678
No, daniel coyne
is a victim.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.614
Whoever else has been targeted
is a victim.

38:04.616 --> 38:05.915
You're a terrorist,

38:05.917 --> 38:08.385
And you're gonna serve 50 years
in federal prison.

38:08.387 --> 38:10.687
Minimum.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.055
(scoffs)

38:13.958 --> 38:16.059
They're incredible...

38:17.061 --> 38:20.330
...These weapons
I've helped build.

38:20.332 --> 38:23.900
You sit behind
a computer monitor,

38:23.902 --> 38:26.002
Point, click and...

38:26.004 --> 38:29.873
Thousands of miles away,
total destruction.

38:34.412 --> 38:37.514
Parsa thinks it's only
fair <i>we</i> get a taste.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.985
Bishop:
<i>The drone's been loaded</i>
<i>with a hundred pounds</i>

38:41.987 --> 38:44.321
Of c-4 explosives.
It's out there now.

38:44.323 --> 38:45.822
Erin pace doesn't
know the target.

38:45.824 --> 38:49.426
Wanted us to catch her;
it was part of his plan.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.828
He kept her in the dark
intentionally.
We need to find him.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.797
There's a second team at nsa
helping the fbi

38:53.799 --> 38:56.099
Run a high-frequency trace on
any unexplained radio signals.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.334
We will.
Gibbs:
Not in time.

38:57.336 --> 38:58.468
What's his target?

38:58.470 --> 39:00.837
For taking out
his training camp.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.939
The pentagon?
Military bases?

39:02.941 --> 39:06.343
Parsa's targets are symbolic--
he doesn't want to just...

39:06.345 --> 39:07.744
Take out some soldiers.
Bishop...

39:07.746 --> 39:09.112
What is he thinking?

39:09.114 --> 39:14.784
Like-like coyne, who helped take
out his compound in pakistan.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.920
Call mcgee.
The conrad gala.

39:16.922 --> 39:18.555
Half the counterterrorism
community is there tonight.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.090
People who have been
hunting parsa for years.

39:20.092 --> 39:22.525
Call mcgee.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.594
(drone whirring)

39:26.464 --> 39:29.532
(piano playing mid-tempo jazz)
(phone ringing)

39:31.402 --> 39:32.969
(mcgee groans quietly)

39:32.971 --> 39:34.404
Tony, you know, I figured

39:34.406 --> 39:37.607
You'd try and upstage
my one night off.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.376
What?

39:39.378 --> 39:41.411
Wait, hold on.
What is it?

39:41.413 --> 39:42.812
I don't know.
I can't hear.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.447
Um, I'll meet
you inside?

39:44.449 --> 39:45.815
Okay?
Okay.

39:50.154 --> 39:51.121
Tony, what's going on?

39:51.123 --> 39:52.589
Parsa's drone wasn't destroyed.

39:52.591 --> 39:54.391
He's using it
on the conrad gala.

39:54.393 --> 39:56.159
Homeland and metro
are on their way.

39:56.161 --> 39:58.395
Get everyone out there,
right now!

39:58.397 --> 39:59.829
(drone whirring)

39:59.831 --> 40:01.865
Bishop: Sigint team's got a hit
on the radio frequency...

40:01.867 --> 40:03.533
(explosion thunders)

40:06.537 --> 40:07.604
Oh, my god.

40:07.606 --> 40:09.139
Gibbs, are you there?

40:09.141 --> 40:11.141
Bishop, give me the address.

40:11.143 --> 40:12.142
Okay. Okay, stand by.

40:12.144 --> 40:13.176
Are we going to mcgee?

40:13.178 --> 40:15.645
No. We get parsa.

40:15.647 --> 40:18.181
(engine revving)

40:19.483 --> 40:21.584
(men speaking
native language nearby)

40:23.187 --> 40:25.088
(men continue speaking)

40:29.827 --> 40:32.095
(men continue
in native language)

40:38.969 --> 40:42.071
(men continue
in native language)

40:42.073 --> 40:43.506
Gibbs:
Federal agents!

40:46.010 --> 40:48.812
â™ª

41:00.024 --> 41:01.157
(door slams)

41:05.529 --> 41:07.096
(panting)

41:07.098 --> 41:08.231
Benham parsa!

41:08.233 --> 41:09.866
Hands above your head!

41:14.171 --> 41:16.573
(vehicle approaching)

41:24.515 --> 41:26.916
(engine roaring,
tires squealing in distance)

41:30.254 --> 41:33.723
Hey. I'm escorting erin pace
to federal detention.

41:33.725 --> 41:37.560
I was hoping I'd see
you before I left.
Don't be a stranger.

41:37.562 --> 41:41.097
(laughs) you keep that
bottle in a safe place.

41:41.099 --> 41:44.067
Someday we'll finish it.
And, jethro...

41:45.002 --> 41:47.070
You'll get him;
you always do.

41:47.072 --> 41:49.038
(elevator bell chimes)

41:49.040 --> 41:51.708
Hey, I just came
from the scene.

41:51.710 --> 41:54.611
Mcgee's okay. He wasn't
in the hotel when the drone hit.

41:54.613 --> 41:56.279
Casualties?
Four dead so far.

41:56.281 --> 41:58.214
More than
a few dozen wounded.

41:58.216 --> 41:59.749
Delilah?

41:59.751 --> 42:02.218
She was hit
with a lot of shrapnel.

42:02.220 --> 42:04.254
She's in surgery.
They're doing what they can.

42:04.256 --> 42:07.557
Should we go to the hospital?
Gibbs: No.

42:07.559 --> 42:09.692
No, we should
find parsa.
How?

42:09.694 --> 42:11.561
You start at
the beginning, bishop.

42:14.031 --> 42:15.031
Come on.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.000
This is what you do.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.670
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

42:23.607 --> 42:24.307
Bishop.

42:26.877 --> 42:27.810
Come on!

42:38.255 --> 42:40.223
All right, get to work.

42:40.225 --> 42:42.025
You find him.

42:42.027 --> 42:43.826
(bishop sighs)

42:55.639 --> 42:57.640
Get this
son of a bitch.
