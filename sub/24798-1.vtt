WEBVTT

00:16.224 --> 00:17.767
[ekg beeping]

00:37.412 --> 00:38.246
[Pantilat] Where are we?

00:40.457 --> 00:43.543
-San Francisco.
-[Pantilat] San Francisco, right.

00:44.502 --> 00:45.336
What month?

00:46.004 --> 00:47.422
Oh, February.

00:48.506 --> 00:49.841
[Pantilat] Who's the president?

00:52.802 --> 00:54.137
[all laughing]

00:55.764 --> 00:57.599
Okay, you don't have to say it.

00:58.224 --> 01:00.226
-Who was our last president?
-[woman] Yeah.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.228
Barack Obama.

01:02.312 --> 01:03.313
Exactly.

01:03.396 --> 01:05.398
And this one, today is...

01:06.816 --> 01:09.360
[stammering] Today is...

01:10.111 --> 01:13.198
Today is... Donald Trump.

01:13.281 --> 01:14.115
Yeah.

01:14.949 --> 01:17.494
-[Pantilat] How old is your son?
-[Mitra] Eight.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.747
Such a funny guy.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.832
-[Pantilat] Heh. Is he?
-He's a funny guy.

01:23.625 --> 01:26.795
[Sumser] She's a 45-year-old woman
originally from Iran.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.630
Her husband's Hamid.

01:28.713 --> 01:33.092
Um, she was a midwife.
In talking about being a midwife...

01:33.176 --> 01:36.054
...she talked about natural death
and natural birth,

01:36.137 --> 01:37.722
and linking those two things.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.266
[Pantilat]
I also wonder about a hospice referral.

01:40.809 --> 01:44.562
It may be hard for them
because of where they are, mentally.

01:45.480 --> 01:49.651
[Denah] I had some conversation with her
and her mother exactly about that,

01:49.734 --> 01:53.988
and Mother came outside the room
afterwards with me and said,

01:54.072 --> 01:59.911
"Hospice means death. We're not--
Do not talk about it with her."

01:59.994 --> 02:02.080
[Pantilat] Your insight was a good one,
Denah.

02:02.163 --> 02:05.166
It's healthy people who think
about how they wanna die

02:05.250 --> 02:08.878
and sick people who think about
how they wanna live, [chuckles] you know?

02:08.962 --> 02:09.921
It's easy to...

02:11.131 --> 02:15.260
fantasize about the beach
and the mountains and--

02:15.343 --> 02:18.930
And then you get sick and it's like,
"I just want to live."

02:25.270 --> 02:28.815
Nice to meet you. I'm the doctor
on the palliative care team.

02:28.898 --> 02:32.068
-Thank you.
-Have you heard of palliative care?

02:32.485 --> 02:35.029
-Sure.
-[Kym] We have palliative care up at home.

02:35.113 --> 02:38.158
[Pantilat] Can I ask you what
you understand palliative care to be?

02:38.241 --> 02:41.411
Um... Sort of end-of-life care.

02:41.494 --> 02:45.456
[Pantilat] We think of palliative care
as helping people live as well as possible

02:45.540 --> 02:48.042
for as long as possible. We work together.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.920
It's doctors, nurses,
social workers, and chaplains

02:51.004 --> 02:54.674
focused on not just the disease,
but the whole person,

02:54.757 --> 02:59.095
to help people with their symptoms, making
sure they, um, have information they need

02:59.178 --> 03:02.599
to make good decisions about their care,
support for the patient and family,

03:02.682 --> 03:05.518
emotional, psychological,
spiritual support.

03:06.144 --> 03:10.273
We're sort of in a spot where we're not
really, uh, ready for hospice.

03:10.356 --> 03:13.276
I don't think,
and I think she thinks the same thing.

03:13.359 --> 03:16.404
[Pantilat] When you say not ready,
tell me what your thoughts are.

03:16.487 --> 03:18.573
-[Kym] What are your thoughts?
-Well, to me,

03:18.656 --> 03:21.200
I guess part of that is, uh...

03:26.706 --> 03:29.000
-Like, very, very end of life.
-Yeah.

03:29.584 --> 03:33.379
Hospice has a label of,
"Oh, that's it, kiss it goodbye."

03:33.463 --> 03:37.800
-But this is more help you transition.
-Totally.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.136
I've been a nurse for 40 years.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.223
Patients come into the hospital
and die and...

03:44.807 --> 03:48.394
That's not how I wanted to do it.
So, I wanted to stay home.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.079
[rock music playing]

04:10.083 --> 04:10.917
Right?

04:11.876 --> 04:12.710
[man] Yeah.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.713
[humming]

04:24.305 --> 04:29.060
Two people can have very much the
same circumstance, same disease perhaps,

04:29.143 --> 04:32.647
and one person is taking it in stride,
and the other is just--

04:34.107 --> 04:36.693
Can't accommodate the illness.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.861
Can't accommodate the diagnosis.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.322
In my experience, it took me several years

04:41.406 --> 04:44.617
before I stopped comparing my new body
to the old body.

04:45.285 --> 04:49.497
But when I did stop comparing--
When this became the whole me,

04:49.580 --> 04:52.583
not me missing stuff, I stopped suffering.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.502
My identity had--

04:54.919 --> 04:57.338
Had accommodated the facts of my life.

04:58.464 --> 05:02.010
So, I like thinking about suffering
as a gap. Like a wedge.

05:02.093 --> 05:05.263
The gap between the world you want
and the world you got.

05:05.346 --> 05:08.391
You know, that, to me,
sums it up very nicely.

05:08.474 --> 05:11.311
Okay. Yeah, let's do the other side, too.

05:12.395 --> 05:15.648
[Jolene]
Bruce, 66-year-old, he arrived on Friday.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.734
-From UC?
-From UCSF.

05:17.817 --> 05:22.280
Um, that day I went to see him,
he had made the decision

05:22.363 --> 05:25.533
with the medical providers
that he was gonna stop dialysis.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.119
-So, it was a pretty crucial moment.
-Mm-hm.

05:28.202 --> 05:31.706
And then I came in to talk to him
about Zen Hospice Project.

05:31.789 --> 05:34.250
And, um, he lit up.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.419
[Miller] I heard you're eating again.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.422
-Yeah.
-How is that?

05:40.131 --> 05:44.260
-There's a good kitchen for you.
-Yeah, it's good. Everyone is good.

05:44.343 --> 05:45.219
Yeah.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.929
Do you have questions for us?

05:47.013 --> 05:51.267
I'm also a doctor. So, if you have
medical questions or anything else,

05:51.350 --> 05:54.896
or anything that's not happening here
that you wanna happen, I don't know.

05:54.979 --> 05:55.813
Mm-hm.

05:56.397 --> 05:59.192
[Miller] You've met a bunch of volunteers
by now, nurses.

05:59.275 --> 06:01.319
-Oh, yeah.
-[Miller] Yeah.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.988
-[Jolene] I think you're kind of popular.
-[Miller laughs]

06:04.072 --> 06:07.700
-[Jolene] I heard through the grapevine.
-[Miller] That's what I heard, Bruce.

06:07.784 --> 06:08.826
Wow.

06:13.414 --> 06:16.751
[Miller] What really galvanized
my interest in going into medicine

06:16.834 --> 06:21.422
and being a physician
was my experience as a disabled person.

06:21.839 --> 06:25.343
In other words, living with illness
and adapting to illness,

06:25.426 --> 06:28.554
and dealing with all the things
that we can't control,

06:28.638 --> 06:32.141
and trying to refashion ourselves
when shit goes wrong.

06:33.309 --> 06:37.271
That's what took me through medical school
and into palliative care.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.530
The basic principle
of Zen Hospice Project--

06:45.613 --> 06:48.908
Part of the muscle
is you don't run away from hard stuff.

06:48.991 --> 06:51.160
You don't run away from suffering.

06:53.538 --> 06:57.500
I started out this year,
you know, not feeling well.

06:57.834 --> 07:01.087
Uh... a little weight gain,
temperature up,

07:01.170 --> 07:04.590
a little out of breath,
in a great deal of pain.

07:04.799 --> 07:08.136
They get me to the hospital,
they get me registered,

07:08.219 --> 07:10.972
and they start trying to manage the pain.

07:11.764 --> 07:15.393
[sobbing]
So, we get the pain down to like, zero...

07:16.310 --> 07:18.062
and I start feeling better.

07:18.146 --> 07:22.024
And they diagnose me with, um, fibroids.

07:22.859 --> 07:26.154
But they send me to a gynecologist
that was a specialist.

07:26.946 --> 07:31.784
She said, "Yeah, you do have fibroids,
but that's hardly your issue.

07:33.536 --> 07:39.375
Your issue is that your uterus
is a cancerous mass."

07:40.501 --> 07:42.712
It's basically incurable.

07:47.216 --> 07:49.218
But at any rate, I'm doing good.

07:50.428 --> 07:51.262
Are you?

07:52.763 --> 07:55.766
-I am.
-I mean, this story is so fresh, isn't it?

07:56.142 --> 07:58.853
-Yeah.
-I am doing good.

08:00.313 --> 08:04.025
-I feel better more than I feel bad.
-Mm-hm.

08:04.108 --> 08:09.071
But, um, I'm here now with someone
who can watch the symptoms with me

08:09.822 --> 08:12.283
and understand
what's right or wrong with it...

08:12.366 --> 08:13.201
Mm-hm.

08:13.284 --> 08:17.788
...and give me medication and monitor it,
so I don't have to do it all by myself.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.380
[Pantilat]
There's no right or wrong answer here.

08:26.464 --> 08:30.718
Some families, some patients will say,
"I wanna be home.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.470
I wanna be with my family.

08:32.553 --> 08:34.722
I wanna figure out
how to get good caregiving at home.

08:34.805 --> 08:38.309
I don't want more treatment."
That's a legitimate decision.

08:38.601 --> 08:42.104
There are other people who say,
"If there's a medicine

08:42.188 --> 08:44.815
that might make my symptoms better,

08:44.899 --> 08:48.444
might help me live a few more weeks,
I would like to give it a try."

08:48.528 --> 08:52.740
One choice, I mean, to be clear,
is to stop all active cancer treatment,

08:52.823 --> 08:55.368
meaning no drugs attacking the cancer.

08:55.701 --> 08:59.247
[Hamid] So, she's a big fighter.
She has some concerns.

08:59.330 --> 09:03.543
She doesn't wanna be disabled,
but we are not there yet, you know?

09:03.626 --> 09:08.631
I mean, still, we have chance to fight,
and I think we should fight.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.885
[Vaji] Right now, she is disabled, Hamid.

09:14.595 --> 09:15.805
She cannot walk.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.641
[Hamid] Obviously, she--

09:18.724 --> 09:21.561
You think after this procedure,
she's gonna walk?

09:22.061 --> 09:24.480
What percent? There is no hope.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.650
-[Hamid] Then I don't know.
-Ask her. She can answer.

09:29.068 --> 09:32.446
-[Hamid] Okay, and if she cannot talk?
-[Vaji] Then you have to decide.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.700
-Okay, and-- But--
-[Vaji] Then, it's not--

09:35.783 --> 09:38.411
So, we don't-- We're not gonna let her go.

09:38.995 --> 09:42.832
Do you want to let her go?
Is she inconvenient for people?

09:42.915 --> 09:46.544
[Vaji] No, I don't wanna see her
like that. She's suffering.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.463
-That's it.
-She's resting.

09:51.215 --> 09:53.884
-[Pantilat] Does she seem worse to you?
-Yes, very worse.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.636
[Pantilat] Than when she came
to the hospital?

09:55.720 --> 09:56.554
Yes.

09:58.055 --> 10:02.268
One night, she could only sleep
very little. I mean, comfortably.

10:03.269 --> 10:07.106
-[Pantilat] That's very distressing.
-It's hurting me. I am mother.

10:07.189 --> 10:10.568
You are not mother to know
what is going on in my heart.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.195
And now she cannot walk even.

10:13.738 --> 10:19.118
I'll tell you the way we approach this,
is really trying to get back to Mitra.

10:19.201 --> 10:22.371
And if she was clear in her thinking,

10:22.455 --> 10:25.583
seeing herself in the bed,
the way she is right now,

10:25.666 --> 10:28.377
what decision would she make
about the treatment?

10:28.461 --> 10:30.129
[Vaji] She wouldn't like that.

10:30.212 --> 10:32.131
[Pantilat]
She wouldn't take the treatment.

10:32.214 --> 10:33.549
But Hamid thinks she would.

10:44.352 --> 10:47.104
[Pat] The whole idea behind chemo

10:47.688 --> 10:49.690
is to shrink the cancer.

10:49.774 --> 10:52.443
-Mm-hm.
-To slow it down.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.987
I want to make sure that, you know--

10:55.071 --> 10:59.825
Like, we were talking about on Friday,
this weighing this benefit to you

10:59.909 --> 11:02.328
-Okay.
-versus the harm to you.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.622
-Yes.
-And I know it's a mystery.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.374
-[Pat] Yes.
-You never really know,

11:06.457 --> 11:09.460
-but we could ponder and think about it.
-All right.

11:09.543 --> 11:13.506
Because I know how you felt
when you went to that first appointment.

11:13.589 --> 11:16.967
Yes, that first chemo.
I couldn't believe how tired I was.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.762
-I've not been tired like that before.
-[Jolene] Mm-hm.

11:19.845 --> 11:20.679
Yeah.

11:21.138 --> 11:24.683
How would you know
that this is the right path for you?

11:25.059 --> 11:29.605
Anything that cuts the time
is what we won't do.

11:29.688 --> 11:31.982
-[Jolene] Mm-hm.
-So, I'm counting on that.

11:32.691 --> 11:36.153
And in terms of the quality of that time,

11:36.237 --> 11:39.907
no matter what decision you make,
what's most important for you

11:39.990 --> 11:43.577
for however many days, weeks, months
that you may have left?

11:43.661 --> 11:46.288
-[Pat] Just take each day at a time.
-Mm-hm.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.582
[Pat] Just take each day at a time.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.836
Every moment is still a gift.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.087
You're still here.

11:53.170 --> 11:56.590
-Yeah.
-And that in itself is a gift.

11:56.674 --> 11:57.591
[Jolene] Mm-hm.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.977
[Vaji] Old picture from Mitra.

12:09.353 --> 12:11.188
Mitra with husband.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.859
2015.

12:19.488 --> 12:20.990
Let's see. Let me find...

12:25.661 --> 12:26.829
Persian New Year.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.460
[Vaji] This is Mitra.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.133
[Hamid] Aaron and Mitra.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.887
He's always hanging around Mommy's neck.

13:07.786 --> 13:11.624
[Pantilat] I wanted to let you know,
Mitra, that today is my last day here.

13:11.707 --> 13:14.502
Next week,
Dr. Elia will be covering for me.

13:14.585 --> 13:18.297
You might have met him before.
The bald doctor with the glasses.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.424
And I'll keep tabs on you, okay?

13:25.888 --> 13:28.349
Her sister is coming from Switzerland.

13:29.016 --> 13:29.850
[Pantilat] When?

13:31.060 --> 13:31.977
[Vaji] Next week.

13:33.020 --> 13:36.232
-You think she gonna make it?
-[Pantilat] I hope so.

13:42.613 --> 13:43.948
[ekg beeping]

13:48.035 --> 13:50.371
[Pantilat] You've been dealt
a hand of cards,

13:50.454 --> 13:52.331
and we could wish we had different cards,

13:52.414 --> 13:56.126
or we could play a different game,
but this is where we are now.

13:56.585 --> 14:00.839
One of the things I wanna discuss
as part of the research program,

14:00.923 --> 14:03.842
and Mitra's a part of this program,

14:03.926 --> 14:07.388
is to try to understand
what happened in the cancer.

14:07.471 --> 14:11.058
And after someone dies,
we have the ability to do an autopsy,

14:11.141 --> 14:15.187
and to try to take the cancers out
and study them in great detail.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.147
How you gonna do it?

14:17.606 --> 14:19.608
Just explain for me.

14:20.401 --> 14:25.322
You're gonna open all the body,
you're gonna take some of body?

14:25.406 --> 14:27.491
What--? How--? How you gonna do it?

14:27.575 --> 14:31.245
It's, in some ways, kind of like
an operation when somebody's alive, so...

14:31.328 --> 14:34.456
Um, uh, you know, you cut the body open,

14:34.540 --> 14:37.167
take out organs
where the cancer is located,

14:37.251 --> 14:39.253
close her back up, like surgery,

14:39.753 --> 14:42.256
uh, then you proceed
with whatever arrangements

14:42.339 --> 14:45.259
you'd wanna have with her
under normal circumstances.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.475
[Pantilat] Is the hard part thinking
about the autopsy,

14:53.559 --> 14:55.895
or thinking about it means Mitra has died?

14:55.978 --> 14:57.396
No. I wanna know just--

14:57.479 --> 14:59.690
You cannot answer. It's okay.

15:00.024 --> 15:04.653
If you were in this situation,
what would you do then?

15:06.071 --> 15:07.156
Would you do that?

15:08.699 --> 15:11.493
Your wife, your sister, or yourself.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.288
-You. You would do that?
-I would do it.

15:14.371 --> 15:18.000
-Yes. What about you? Be honest with me.
-There's no question.

15:18.083 --> 15:21.629
If it were me, I would do it.
But I think it's very personal.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.965
Yeah. I would do for myself...

15:25.716 --> 15:29.136
but I cannot imagine for my kids,
you know.

15:29.219 --> 15:32.389
-It's a little hard, but in my--
-Yeah.

15:32.473 --> 15:35.559
-[Hamid] It's very hard. It's not--
-I am thinking...

15:37.269 --> 15:41.273
Yeah, I want to help people,
because I am so suffering.

15:41.357 --> 15:44.360
I don't want other mothers suffer like me.

15:45.444 --> 15:48.447
But somehow, I cannot see my...

15:51.909 --> 15:53.077
[sobbing]

15:54.662 --> 15:55.496
Yes.

15:55.579 --> 15:58.624
[Pantilat chuckles]
Is it an okay time for us to visit?

15:58.707 --> 16:01.043
-[Elia] You can stay there.
-[boy] No, I'm gonna go.

16:01.377 --> 16:04.797
[Mitra] Holy shoot. Wow.

16:04.880 --> 16:05.714
[chuckles]

16:06.298 --> 16:09.677
-Somebody special.
-[Elia] Well, you are special.

16:10.386 --> 16:14.640
-All right. How are you doing today?
-I promised to be okay.

16:15.557 --> 16:18.769
I promised to be fine...

16:21.021 --> 16:22.439
but I am not.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.943
I'm not keeping my promise.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.780
-How is your mood today?
-Much better.

16:29.863 --> 16:34.076
-[Elia] Much better?
-[Mitra] Everything has been better.

16:34.785 --> 16:35.828
Everything.

16:38.414 --> 16:39.248
Every day.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.350
All I could say was,
"I'm at your mercy here. I'm at your hand.

16:58.434 --> 17:02.271
So, if this is the best idea,
I'm going to have to trust you."

17:02.354 --> 17:05.858
When I saw your face
in that meeting, when he said to you:

17:05.941 --> 17:10.029
"What we might be able to give you
is four to six more months, maybe."

17:10.446 --> 17:13.824
You know, that was just deep,
to have to think about that.

17:13.907 --> 17:17.119
Deciding, "Okay, do I go down
the chemo route,

17:17.202 --> 17:20.539
not knowing if it's gonna
make me feel worse?

17:20.914 --> 17:24.001
If at the end, will it give me more time?"

17:24.084 --> 17:26.420
You know, "Is it the time that I want?"

17:26.795 --> 17:28.422
-I want to go for it.
-[Jolene] Okay.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.758
[Sueann] Chemo is a full-time job.

17:30.841 --> 17:34.428
-[Pat] Okay.
-So, let's say if you started on Monday...

17:35.387 --> 17:38.557
the next few days,
you're gonna start feeling crummy.

17:38.640 --> 17:39.475
Okay.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.893
[Sueann] About this time,

17:40.976 --> 17:43.020
you're gonna start to feel
a little better.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.856
-Okay.
-[Sueann] It's a relatively normal week.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.151
-And then guess what. It's been 21 days.
-Wow.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.944
[Sueann] So, that following Monday,

17:51.028 --> 17:53.197
you go back
and start everything over again.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.740
Over again.

17:54.823 --> 17:59.828
Everything is gonna be dependent upon
how well you handle this first drug,

17:59.912 --> 18:02.831
'cause this first drug
is a little bit of a doozy.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.792
-Wow.
-[Jolene] Mm-hm.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.251
-So...
-[Sueann] Yeah.

18:06.335 --> 18:11.632
Cancer itself, and chemo on top of it,
it's gonna throw you curve balls.

18:11.715 --> 18:15.761
It's been a total new way of life.

18:15.844 --> 18:19.348
I think of it as the asteroid in the dark,

18:19.431 --> 18:22.142
and it's just shooting off some big rocks,

18:22.226 --> 18:25.312
and I'm amazed when I look up and go,
"It missed me."

18:25.395 --> 18:27.648
-[Sueann] Yes.
-You know, it missed me.

18:28.148 --> 18:29.274
[laughing]

18:29.358 --> 18:30.776
-[Sueann] Yeah.
-I'm still here.

18:30.859 --> 18:34.071
You know, it could have taken me out,
but I'm still here.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.867
[Bivona] I'm glad you ate more today.
That's a good sign.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.663
-You have a little more color today.
-Yeah.

18:43.205 --> 18:48.752
This is my major plan,
to be able to... walk.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.922
That's a good goal to keep in your mind.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.424
Just being independent

18:55.092 --> 18:58.804
-and being in a positive mood.
-[Bivona] Mm-hm.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.890
She's trying very hard. Very hard.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.600
I try. I try.

19:04.226 --> 19:08.856
-But I feel like I'm against two walls.
-Mm-hm.

19:08.939 --> 19:11.692
-[Mitra] You know?
-[Vaji] You have to try this date.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.404
-For the road.
-Take one for your wife.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.115
Yeah, thank you.
I'll take one or two more.

19:18.198 --> 19:22.077
We'll have them tonight for dessert.
That's enough.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.580
-Thank you. Yeah, that's fine.
-One more.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.456
-Okay, one more.
-Maybe you drink wine.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.167
-[Bivona] Not tonight.
-[laughing]

19:28.250 --> 19:30.460
I don't know if you wanna have kid.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.797
-[Bivona] Yeah?
-If you are thinking about having kid?

19:33.881 --> 19:37.092
[Vaji] If you and your wife
eat one date a day,

19:37.426 --> 19:40.220
your baby hundred percent is gonna be boy.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.346
-Oh, yeah?
-[Vaji] Boy?

19:41.430 --> 19:44.766
-I don't believe that, but they say--
-That's good to know.

19:44.850 --> 19:48.145
-Is that what you did? Did you eat a date?
-I don't know.

19:49.313 --> 19:53.066
Okay, Mitra, I'm gonna go.
Have a wonderful night with your sister.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.943
-Thank you.
-And your husband.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.280
It's gonna be a great night tonight.

20:06.079 --> 20:09.666
[in Farsi] Hello! Hello!

20:11.877 --> 20:13.587
[Mitra] This is Azita.

20:15.005 --> 20:19.551
-These are all the team of my new friends.
-[Azita] I see, I see.

20:19.927 --> 20:23.764
Of 2017. What do you think?

20:23.847 --> 20:26.683
[in Farsi] They are filming me.

20:27.476 --> 20:30.270
They like me very much.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.856
The mic is in front of my mouth only.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.025
[Azita]
Later they will translate everything.

20:35.108 --> 20:38.654
-Let them do it. No problem.
-They will put subtitles on everything.

20:38.737 --> 20:43.283
No problem. Let them do it.
I speak the truth.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.979
-[Miller] Nice shoes.
-Thank you.

21:12.604 --> 21:14.523
-Did you get any lunch?
-Uh, not yet.

21:14.606 --> 21:18.735
Let's talk about that shortness of breath,
but the bigger reason to be here

21:18.819 --> 21:23.782
-is continue to talk through death.
-You gave me an assignment.

21:23.865 --> 21:26.618
-[Miller] Yup.
-You told me to make friends with death.

21:26.702 --> 21:30.247
-[Miller] Yeah. Yeah, okay.
-I have failed the assignment. Failed.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.164
[Miller] Okay.

21:31.498 --> 21:33.500
-I love to live.
-[Miller] Yeah.

21:34.084 --> 21:37.421
-I am not accepting this.
-[Miller] Friends with death may be tough.

21:38.130 --> 21:43.260
But maybe what I meant would have been
to have some sort of relationship with it.

21:43.343 --> 21:45.137
-With this subject.
-[Thekla] Okay.

21:45.220 --> 21:46.805
Doesn't need to be friendly at all.

21:47.014 --> 21:52.102
Just so that it's, uh, less scarier
than this unknown thing in the closet

21:52.185 --> 21:54.730
that we never look at,
never see, never touch.

21:54.813 --> 21:59.234
You know, I think the scary part
is the unknown.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.402
[Miller] Mm-hm.

22:00.485 --> 22:03.071
-And the lack of control.
-Yeah.

22:03.655 --> 22:07.534
[Miller] Is the unknown what
it's gonna feel like to actually be dying,

22:07.659 --> 22:10.579
or what it's gonna be like to be dead?

22:11.163 --> 22:11.997
[Thekla] Both.

22:12.247 --> 22:15.792
Because from where I sit,
I'm not sure that we can know

22:15.876 --> 22:18.462
-what it's like to be dead from here.
-[Thekla] No.

22:19.129 --> 22:21.506
You tell me if you feel otherwise, but I--

22:21.965 --> 22:26.094
So, the given that that's not possible,
[scoffs] next up would be,

22:26.178 --> 22:28.430
okay, if we can't change that, well...

22:29.598 --> 22:32.517
-maybe we can get used to it a little bit.
-[Thekla] Mm-hm.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.978
So, maybe in terms of the being dead part,

22:35.062 --> 22:37.939
maybe that's our goal,
is to get used to this idea--

22:38.023 --> 22:41.610
Being able to hold this idea
of not knowing, holding the mystery.

22:41.693 --> 22:42.944
[Thekla] Yeah. Yeah.

22:43.028 --> 22:46.281
-That makes sense.
-That, I think, is a more realistic goal

22:46.364 --> 22:48.492
-than solving that mystery.
-[Thekla] Yeah.

22:48.575 --> 22:51.787
-Um... So, does that grab you?
-[Thekla] Also maybe trusting a bit.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.122
It could be terrible,
but it could be wonderful.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.249
This part of my life is wonderful.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.127
And who would have thought?

22:59.252 --> 23:03.215
[Miller] I will tell you, Thekla,
from doing this work and being near people

23:03.298 --> 23:06.551
who are at the very, very end,
everything I've ever seen

23:07.135 --> 23:10.180
would suggest that wherever we're going,

23:11.098 --> 23:14.476
whatever abyss we're meeting ain't so bad.

23:14.559 --> 23:17.562
-[Thekla] Really?
-All I can say is from what I've seen,

23:17.646 --> 23:20.357
from people in their final moments
crossing over,

23:20.440 --> 23:24.694
and from reports of people
who have gone and come back, and--

23:25.779 --> 23:29.658
I don't know that that proves anything,
but it's maybe worth noting

23:29.741 --> 23:31.243
that, just empirically...

23:33.036 --> 23:34.663
I don't know that it's so bad.

23:34.871 --> 23:37.666
[Thekla] I think there has to be something
to those reports.

23:37.749 --> 23:41.253
-Seems likely. They're pretty consistent.
-[Thekla] They are consistent.

23:41.503 --> 23:44.840
Maybe it's enough, at least,
to warrant a little leap of faith

23:44.923 --> 23:46.258
-on your part.
-[Thekla] Yeah.

23:57.644 --> 24:00.480
[Miller]
I did brush up against death myself.

24:01.398 --> 24:04.234
Sophomore year of college,
Princeton University,

24:04.317 --> 24:07.445
screwing around on a commuter train
with some friends.

24:07.779 --> 24:12.200
Just parked, not moving. We didn't think
we were doing anything that daring.

24:12.826 --> 24:14.828
Uh, but I had a metal watch on,

24:14.911 --> 24:17.289
and when I climbed up
on top of the train--

24:17.956 --> 24:21.168
It was one of those trains
that the wires run overhead,

24:21.710 --> 24:24.337
like the buses in San Francisco,
for example.

24:24.629 --> 24:28.633
When I stood up on the train, I was close
enough to the pantograph,

24:28.717 --> 24:32.345
the metal thing that, uh,
attaches the train to the wires,

24:32.721 --> 24:35.807
and electricity arced to my watch,
entered the arm,

24:35.891 --> 24:38.018
and blew down and out my feet.

24:38.727 --> 24:41.521
So, uh... that was that.

24:41.980 --> 24:45.609
It was a, you know, spontaneous,
immediate, crazy experience.

24:46.318 --> 24:51.364
Uh... The amputations were surgical
in the coming days and weeks, but yeah.

24:51.448 --> 24:54.868
I lost both legs below the knee
and my left arm below the elbow.

24:54.951 --> 24:55.827
Um...

24:57.037 --> 24:58.121
I was 19.

25:05.253 --> 25:07.130
What is the situation with Mitra?

25:08.882 --> 25:12.844
From a short-term perspective,
she's looking better. We also know...

25:13.595 --> 25:16.306
that the underlying cancer is unchanged.

25:16.389 --> 25:17.515
[sighs]

25:17.891 --> 25:20.393
We gone through this so many times.

25:21.478 --> 25:24.397
And every time, she was--

25:25.065 --> 25:29.402
One drug goes down,
and again, she comes back up.

25:29.486 --> 25:33.281
I cannot just believe
this is the end game,

25:33.657 --> 25:35.742
because I have seen this before.

25:35.825 --> 25:40.580
What we know for sure is that she has
a very limited time to live...

25:41.498 --> 25:43.041
regardless of what we do.

25:43.124 --> 25:45.418
-Very limited time.
-So, it's maybe...?

25:46.419 --> 25:47.879
[Elia] I would say probably--

25:48.713 --> 25:51.091
It's really hard, I mean, to give numbers.

25:51.174 --> 25:52.300
-I would say--
-Yeah.

25:52.592 --> 25:54.719
It can be from days to weeks.

25:55.345 --> 25:56.888
If she gets out of this...

25:56.972 --> 25:59.474
[in Farsi] Why are you crying, Azita?

26:00.267 --> 26:02.936
Azita, we all die. It's not just her.

26:03.019 --> 26:03.853
Let's just--

26:04.729 --> 26:05.981
Let the doctor talk.

26:06.606 --> 26:09.609
-[in English] Sorry, go ahead.
-[Elia] No, that's okay. I'm sorry.

26:10.193 --> 26:13.947
You know her better than anybody else,
so we need to understand

26:14.030 --> 26:16.491
where she would like to be.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.911
Something that I know
you're strongly against,

26:19.995 --> 26:24.207
but I want to make sure, want to put
on the table, inpatient hospice.

26:25.041 --> 26:25.875
So...

26:26.501 --> 26:28.628
-I see Vicky is ready to say no.
-No.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.464
-Doesn't believe it.
-Don't say that.

26:32.340 --> 26:34.509
[Elia]
Why do you feel strongly against that?

26:34.592 --> 26:40.098
Until end of last breathing,
I wanna be with my baby...

26:40.807 --> 26:45.520
and I can take care of her
either here or either home, I don't care.

26:45.603 --> 26:47.897
So, transferring at home,

26:48.440 --> 26:53.236
there would be the need for somebody
that will take care of her physical needs.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.239
If I have to clean her,
that would be my honor.

26:56.364 --> 26:57.949
No, somebody come at home.

26:58.033 --> 27:00.994
Why you refuse this opportunity
to people come in your home?

27:01.077 --> 27:03.288
-[Hamid] No, she says no to come.
-She does, "No, no, no."

27:03.371 --> 27:05.123
[Elia] We don't have
to make a decision today.

27:05.206 --> 27:07.542
-[Hamid] Exactly.
-[Elia] I just want to make sure.

27:07.625 --> 27:10.754
We don't have to make a decision today.
Sorry, Vicky. Ahem.

27:10.837 --> 27:12.005
[sighs]

27:20.055 --> 27:21.890
[in Farsi] Do you want some chocolate?

27:27.645 --> 27:29.356
Yes, you are my love.

27:35.403 --> 27:36.279
It's your ring.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.701
[Azita] By the power vested in me.

27:42.243 --> 27:46.331
-I now pronounce you husband and wife.
-[Hamid laughing]

27:47.165 --> 27:49.292
You can now kiss the bride.

27:49.959 --> 27:51.920
And the bride can kiss the groom.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.464
[humming "Bridal Chorus"]

27:58.510 --> 28:02.055
It can either be home health, or hospice,

28:02.138 --> 28:06.226
or the house. What will we do?

28:08.228 --> 28:11.439
Because they were asking,
"Where does she want to die?"

28:14.442 --> 28:16.027
Poor Aaron found out, too.

28:18.655 --> 28:23.034
He says, "If Mommy dies,
who will take care of me?"

28:27.247 --> 28:30.667
I say, "Grandma, Grandpa, Uncle."

28:31.209 --> 28:32.544
[giggling]

28:35.755 --> 28:37.340
Okey-dokey. Bye.

28:40.677 --> 28:41.594
[groans]

28:44.597 --> 28:46.683
I'm anxious about something.

28:48.685 --> 28:52.188
-I don't know what it is.
-You don't know?

28:52.355 --> 28:56.109
You're anxious because you saw everyone
and you were happy.

28:56.192 --> 28:58.445
-Because of the excitement.
-No, Mama.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.697
It's the end of her life.
Don't tell her what to eat.

29:00.780 --> 29:03.283
Let her not be strong. It's not important.

29:04.033 --> 29:06.578
This is how it will be
if you take her home.

29:08.037 --> 29:10.540
You'll get upset and you will die.

29:11.124 --> 29:13.126
She'll die and you'll be next!

29:13.209 --> 29:16.713
You shouldn't do it.

29:20.008 --> 29:23.136
I am suffering.

29:24.804 --> 29:26.014
I can't take it anymore.

29:26.097 --> 29:29.058
I'm so tired.

29:29.809 --> 29:33.521
I'm going home now.
They are saying we should go.

29:33.980 --> 29:36.065
I don't have any more tears to cry.

30:01.674 --> 30:04.093
[Lai] We all want to make sure
she doesn't suffer.

30:05.929 --> 30:11.601
But at the same time, we wanted
to clarify what happens when she dies.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.895
We're gonna be very blunt about that.

30:13.978 --> 30:16.940
When her time comes, when she does die,

30:17.065 --> 30:20.193
we'll continue to treat her well
during that time,

30:20.276 --> 30:24.322
but we'd strongly recommend allowing her
to just naturally die on her own

30:24.405 --> 30:26.908
and not attempt CPR,

30:26.991 --> 30:30.495
not try to put in a breathing tube,
those kind of things.

30:31.079 --> 30:32.831
-Naturally.
-[Lai] Yeah.

30:33.915 --> 30:35.667
-It's hard, but--
-[Lai] It's hard.

30:38.586 --> 30:41.506
Again, we hope nothing is gonna
happen any time soon.

30:41.589 --> 30:43.007
We don't anticipate that,

30:43.091 --> 30:46.594
but I think this was just another
good time to think about it.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.596
And I appreciate everybody's help.

30:49.472 --> 30:54.602
Unfortunately, all these good things,
still, Mitra is leaving us.

30:55.603 --> 30:57.105
Let me believe in it now.

30:58.398 --> 31:01.317
I still believe in miracle,
to be honest with you.

31:01.401 --> 31:04.696
This last medicine, I hope it works.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.574
-I don't wanna let her go.
-[Vaji] Hamid.

31:18.710 --> 31:19.544
How is that--?

31:21.546 --> 31:22.922
[Hamid] Aaron, massaging Mama?

31:23.006 --> 31:24.507
-Scratch your head?
-[Mitra] Yeah.

31:24.591 --> 31:25.800
You mean, like this?

31:42.233 --> 31:43.484
And kiss Mama's hand.

31:45.194 --> 31:46.321
You wanna kiss it?

31:49.032 --> 31:49.866
Cute Mama.

31:51.242 --> 31:52.118
Yeah.

32:36.079 --> 32:39.082
[Miller] There's nothing
inherently medical about dying.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.210
It's much larger than medicine.

32:43.044 --> 32:44.629
It's purely human.

32:48.383 --> 32:52.887
Part of that admission is to keep
all of this couched in humanity,

32:53.638 --> 32:58.434
not medical science or social science,
but really a full arch of humanity.

33:05.650 --> 33:06.567
Kindness...

33:08.361 --> 33:15.368
total openness, vulnerability, exchange.
I mean, this is potent stuff.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.644
[woman] One of the things
that needs to be clarified

33:41.728 --> 33:44.480
is that transition from the monitors
and all that.

33:44.564 --> 33:48.234
So we're-- I'm waiting
for the, um, primary medical team to come

33:48.317 --> 33:51.988
and have that discussion with them
before I take out the IV pole.

33:52.071 --> 33:55.575
She's been watching those monitors
and having those machines for so long,

33:55.658 --> 33:59.120
it's a hard transition to, all of
a sudden, say we're taking them away.

33:59.203 --> 34:01.914
-No, no, this is not important anymore.
-Right.

34:01.998 --> 34:05.001
We wanna focus on how she's feeling,
what she needs.

34:05.084 --> 34:07.754
Yeah, that's great.
That's a good way to put it.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.172
How are you doing?

34:10.631 --> 34:12.300
The way she wanted me to be.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.052
-Which is how?
-Happy.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.512
And do the right thing.

34:17.180 --> 34:19.015
That's what she wants me to do.

36:00.867 --> 36:01.993
You have the chart?

37:07.725 --> 37:09.185
[Miller] When someone dies...

37:11.187 --> 37:13.272
we'll all gather around the body...

37:17.109 --> 37:20.238
and then you sprinkle the body
with flowers, you know?

37:20.529 --> 37:22.281
It's so beautiful, so simple.

37:27.912 --> 37:32.166
It's a way to kind of wrap our heads
around the fact that this person's gone.

37:35.920 --> 37:39.423
So, that final parting image
as they're ushering in their grief

37:39.507 --> 37:42.260
is this flower-laden, honored body.

37:42.843 --> 37:44.053
It's such a--

37:45.221 --> 37:48.349
That sprinkles your grief with beauty.

37:50.184 --> 37:51.227
Grief ain't easy.

37:52.186 --> 37:54.313
But it can be poignant and gorgeous.

37:56.649 --> 37:59.068
We are wired to run away from death.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.823
But dying is a part of life.
