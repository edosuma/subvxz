00:58.200 --> 01:01.807
Open the door! Open the door!

01:03.440 --> 01:06.011
Oh, my gosh, what is the matter?

01:06.160 --> 01:09.209
- I don't know what happened.
- Are you OK? Erin...

01:21.680 --> 01:23.808
- All right.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.611
There you go, miss.
Thank you.

01:31.240 --> 01:35.165
Oh, sorry. Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

01:35.360 --> 01:36.521
Are you all right?

01:36.680 --> 01:38.523
Wait, they're not boarding
in there yet.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.561
Come on!

01:49.800 --> 01:52.690
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Have you seen this woman?

01:53.360 --> 01:55.044
- I don't think so.
- Are you sure?

01:55.200 --> 01:56.201
- Yeah, pretty sure.
- No?

02:02.200 --> 02:04.089
- Dino.
- Yes, sir.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.410
Guys, have you seen this woman?

02:08.800 --> 02:11.565
- Isn't she blonde, with short hair maybe?
- Thank you.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.568
Stop the bus! Boston PD.

02:36.920 --> 02:37.921
Excuse me.

02:46.160 --> 02:49.084
Hey! Stop the bus! Open up!

04:38.320 --> 04:41.085
Folks, we'll be stopping
for 15 minutes here in Southport.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.161
Do you have any fresh coffee?

04:51.440 --> 04:53.602
It's so thick,
it tastes like lukewarm mud.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.161
- I don't know what to tell you, ma'am.
- You're gonna have to throw it out.

04:56.320 --> 04:59.005
- It's a fresh Ethiopian blend.
- It's not...

04:59.160 --> 05:01.925
I've never tasted Ethiopian
that tasted like that in my life.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.811
- It's Ethiopian. Yeah.
- It's Ethiopian?

05:06.920 --> 05:08.490
Just the mud for you then?

05:10.960 --> 05:13.008
That'll be 97 cents.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.850
Out of one.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.408
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

05:33.320 --> 05:36.085
And I wish they would, you know,
take us to places that...

06:49.800 --> 06:52.326
- Here you go, Kevin.
- Thank you.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.482
Hey, you catch the game?
Patriots killing 'em.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.284
Hey, we got security footage
from the bus station.

06:56.440 --> 06:59.046
- Want me to take a look at them?
- No, I got it.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.085
All right. Have a good one, buddy.

07:43.240 --> 07:44.651
See ya.

07:49.640 --> 07:54.202
OK, how many in your party, three? OK.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.923
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

08:00.120 --> 08:01.406
Is your owner available?

08:01.560 --> 08:04.131
I'm the owner.
How can I help you?

08:04.280 --> 08:06.965
Uh, do you guys have any job openings?

08:07.840 --> 08:12.084
Uh, well, we've been awfully busy lately.
I might can work you in.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.561
I'm not sure.
Do you have any experience?

08:17.640 --> 08:20.803
So sorry. Frankie!

08:22.240 --> 08:23.844
Yes, I have experience.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.009
I'll be damned.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.768
Don't hover at the tables.

09:16.920 --> 09:20.641
Make sure their glasses are always filled.
Hi, Mary Ann.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.247
And ask 'em if they need something,
but don't ask more than once.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.408
- When you hear this ding...

09:27.560 --> 09:30.530
...try to beat me up here
more times than I beat you.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.364
Perfect size for you.

09:32.520 --> 09:36.445
It's got hardwood floors,
some wainscoting.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.682
It's a great location to town.

09:41.040 --> 09:44.010
A little bit of a fixer-upper,
but it's got a lot of potential.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.208
What do you think?

09:51.960 --> 09:53.644
I'll take it.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.680
Josh!

11:19.920 --> 11:22.924
Two feet on the dock,
I'm not gonna tell you again.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.122
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:38.080 --> 11:43.291
- Um, are your mom and dad around?
- Um, no, but I can help you.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.841
You looking for anything?

11:46.440 --> 11:50.240
Well, now that you ask...
do you have any paint?

11:51.080 --> 11:53.731
Um, we have this book that's...

11:53.880 --> 11:57.566
...with all different kinds
of colors that you can get.

11:57.720 --> 11:59.961
- Oh, really? Oh, that would be great.
- What are you painting?

12:00.120 --> 12:02.726
I'm painting my kitchen floor.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.209
- The floor?
- Why is that funny?

12:07.360 --> 12:10.250
'Cause you usually don't paint floors.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.323
You usually put a rug on them.

12:12.480 --> 12:16.644
Well, I'm thinking that I
want to brighten the place up, so...

12:16.840 --> 12:20.765
- What's a happy color? What could I do?
- Hm... there's yellow.

12:21.640 --> 12:24.849
- Yellow?
- Yeah. The color of the sun.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.686
OK, that is happy. I think you
just sold me on that. All right.

12:28.840 --> 12:31.081
I can go get some samples of it.
I'm Lexie.

12:31.240 --> 12:33.322
- OK, I'm Katie.
- Hi, Katie.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.601
Thank you.

12:36.160 --> 12:39.369
Lower on three. One, two, three.

12:42.920 --> 12:45.002
I'll just... I'll grab the rest.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.763
- What, you're still here?
- Mm-hm.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.241
Let me, uh... let me check you out.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.966
It's just that usually people
are just passing through, you know?

13:02.120 --> 13:07.251
It's kind of a pit stop. Ten minutes
is usually enough. All right.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.925
- I like it.
- Yeah?

13:09.080 --> 13:10.570
Found it!

13:11.360 --> 13:13.488
- Thank you.
- No, no, that's not for...

13:13.640 --> 13:14.680
You're painting something?

13:14.800 --> 13:17.644
Yeah, she needs to paint
her floors in her kitchen.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.370
Ah, OK.

13:19.520 --> 13:23.286
- Yeah, I can take them home?
- Yeah, yeah, take it home.

13:23.440 --> 13:26.330
Pick out your color and we'll...
we'll order it up for you.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.050
- Thank you.
- All right.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.083
- Thanks, Lexie.
- All right, there you go.

13:32.240 --> 13:37.610
- Rice. Ah, basmati, the king of rices.
- Yum.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.005
Good catch.

13:41.080 --> 13:44.050
- Light bulb, ding!
- Tuna.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.521
- Tuna.
- Soap.

13:46.720 --> 13:50.008
- Soap.
- And that'll be 18 even.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.525
OK, thank you.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.768
- All right, out of 20.
- Bag.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.924
Two dollars is your change. We have
some books down here. They're free.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.366
People just leave them
on vacation, so...

13:58.560 --> 14:00.767
Yeah.
You can take a book.

14:00.920 --> 14:02.763
All right. Well, thank you, Lexie.

14:02.920 --> 14:03.921
- Thank you.
- Bye!

14:04.080 --> 14:05.730
Grab a book.

14:05.880 --> 14:08.486
- Yeah, they're really good books.
- How do you know?

14:08.640 --> 14:10.563
- You didn't read any of them.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.688
- Bye.

14:12.840 --> 14:16.083
- You want me to go get Josh?
- Yeah, go grab Josh, will you?

14:17.440 --> 14:21.923
- Josh!
- "The king of rices"?

14:50.280 --> 14:51.486
- Hey, Maddie.
- Hey, Rhett.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.563
- How are we doing?
- Hey, Bass.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.529
Hey, are you OK?

14:55.680 --> 14:57.521
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Y'all looking for somebody?

14:57.600 --> 14:59.364
Yeah, I sure am.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.808
Got a white Honda Civic
parked in a handicapped space outside.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.207
You wouldn't happen to know the owner,
would you?

15:05.360 --> 15:08.011
I sure don't. Can't help you there.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.764
You got our lunch?

15:09.920 --> 15:13.322
Katie! You got the chief's order?

15:16.320 --> 15:18.766
- Sorry it took so long.
- Oh, no problem at all.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.370
- Can I help you?
- Oh! Ooh.

15:30.520 --> 15:33.330
Oh! Uh... You scared me.

15:33.840 --> 15:39.483
Uh... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be snooping. Um...

15:39.640 --> 15:43.440
I wish I had a good excuse,
but it's just idle curiosity.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.886
You're the first neighbor
I've had out here in ages.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.361
Yeah, my Realtor said
I didn't have close neighbors.

15:49.520 --> 15:52.330
Oh, well, I'm not close by city standards.

15:52.480 --> 15:55.211
I'm Jo, by the way.

15:55.880 --> 15:59.566
- Katie.
- Nice to meet you. Um...

15:59.720 --> 16:02.564
Look, I moved out here
same reason as you, I think.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.530
To get some peace and quiet,
so I get it if you just...

16:05.680 --> 16:08.809
Yeah, I like the fact
that I can hear myself think.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.166
Yes, thank you.

16:10.360 --> 16:14.729
I mean, isn't it so nice to be away
from all that noise and that chatter?

16:14.880 --> 16:18.566
I mean, it can be a little bit
deafening sometimes, so it is...

16:18.720 --> 16:22.770
...it is nice to meet somebody
as rustically inclined as I am.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.406
- Yeah. OK.
- All right, well, it was nice to meet you.

16:25.560 --> 16:28.291
- Yeah, you too.
- I'm down the road if you need anything.

16:28.440 --> 16:32.047
I'm stronger than I look.
So, if you get in any trouble...

16:32.200 --> 16:34.009
- OK.
- OK, I'm sorry again.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.003
- It's OK.
- OK.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.321
- Walk safe.
- Thank you.

16:37.480 --> 16:38.925
All right.

16:59.800 --> 17:03.088
How many stops are on your route
from here to Atlanta?

17:03.240 --> 17:04.969
- To Atlanta? Um...
- Yeah.

17:05.119 --> 17:07.327
- Quite a few. I wouldn't know offhand.
- You got a ballpark?

17:07.480 --> 17:08.481
Um...

17:08.640 --> 17:12.122
Come on, buddy.
You gonna buy a ticket or what?

17:12.280 --> 17:16.968
Uh, no, I'm not gonna buy a ticket,
but I can help you. I can help you out.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.442
Uh... Can we open another window
for my friend here?

17:20.640 --> 17:21.800
Beautiful. Thank you.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.645
- OK, so...
- The whole Eastern Seaboard.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.609
Yeah. Down to Atlanta.
What happens in Atlanta?

17:27.760 --> 17:29.649
Well, where do you want to go?

17:30.440 --> 17:33.489
- Where can you go from Atlanta?
- Anywhere.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.244
Atlanta's our southern hub.

17:35.400 --> 17:38.563
There are routes to every city
in America from there.

17:44.400 --> 17:48.007
- Hey, everything OK?
- Shit.

17:48.560 --> 17:51.006
Job just got a little harder, that's all.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.327
- Hey.
- Hey, Lexie.

18:08.520 --> 18:11.046
- Haven't seen those kids in ages.
- How are you?

18:11.200 --> 18:12.770
- They're growing up so fast.
- Good.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.810
- Whatcha doing?
- I'm drawing.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.849
Yeah? Drawing, what are you drawing?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.002
I don't know yet.

18:20.200 --> 18:24.205
Hm. It looks sorta like a... carrot.

18:24.360 --> 18:26.089
- No.
- No?

18:26.240 --> 18:29.289
You need to bring 'em by
and let me see 'em all, I miss 'em.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.283
- Maybe this weekend, all right?
- All right.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.363
Is it a dragonfly?

18:33.520 --> 18:36.330
No, it's a flying fish.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.970
- Need a bag?
- No, no, thanks.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.531
OK.

18:39.720 --> 18:42.371
- A flying fish. Now I see it.
- Well, hi, Katie.

18:42.520 --> 18:43.601
Hey.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.481
See ya.

18:50.720 --> 18:51.721
- Thanks.
- Bye-bye.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.884
I see you're a true artist.
You got blue all over your hands.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.681
- That stupid door. Use the other one.
- I'll just go out this one.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.441
- OK. See ya. Come see me.
- OK. I'll see ya.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.525
Hi.

19:03.680 --> 19:04.806
Oh, hey.

19:04.960 --> 19:09.124
So, I picked out a color from
these samples and I'm thinking

19:09.280 --> 19:11.009
I might go with lemon twist.

19:11.160 --> 19:14.050
OK. You're gonna paint
the floors yellow?

19:14.200 --> 19:16.407
- Yeah, why not?
- You sure about that?

19:16.560 --> 19:19.370
- Yeah, of course, it's happy.
- No, it's a good idea. OK.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.966
- Um...
- How much?

19:22.120 --> 19:24.202
- Uh, probably a gallon.
- A gallon?

19:24.360 --> 19:26.806
- Yeah, a gallon.
- OK, that should be...

19:26.960 --> 19:29.611
You know, I'll put the order in now.
Hopefully, we can get it back by Monday.

19:29.760 --> 19:32.604
- Great. Thanks.
- All right. Lemon twist.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.683
Lemon twist. All right.

19:35.920 --> 19:39.163
I'm gonna need a name and a number

19:39.360 --> 19:41.249
so that I can call you
when the order comes in.

19:42.440 --> 19:46.570
My name's Katie and no number.
I'll just stop by Monday.

19:46.720 --> 19:51.123
OK. I'm Alex, so you know
who to ask for when you come back.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.123
This is Roger,
we're usually around here.

19:53.280 --> 19:54.805
Hi.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.286
- All right.
- Is that it?

19:56.440 --> 19:57.805
That's it.

19:57.960 --> 20:00.645
OK, great, bye.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.731
When did we start
selling paint?

20:04.880 --> 20:06.120
Today.

20:07.880 --> 20:10.201
Ooh, the drawing looks good.

20:10.360 --> 20:11.930
Thank you. Would you like it?

20:12.080 --> 20:14.811
- Really?
- Yeah, I can just make another.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.566
Aw, you're so sweet.
Thank you. I love it.

20:17.720 --> 20:20.769
Give me a hug. All right.

20:21.720 --> 20:25.008
- Thanks. Have a good day.
- You, too.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.531
Katie! Wait up.

20:33.320 --> 20:34.481
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.883
Hi. You might not want the company,
but I'm headed home.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.849
I thought we might walk together.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.809
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah? Oh, good.

20:41.960 --> 20:44.008
Good, it'll keep me from
peeking into stranger's windows.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.925
It's a habit I'm trying to break.

20:47.080 --> 20:50.323
That and snapping my gum.
It's a horrible habit.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.484
I started in middle school and...
What you got there?

20:53.640 --> 20:57.611
Oh, the little girl from the general store,
she drew it for me.

20:57.760 --> 21:01.003
- I think it's the store owner's daughter.
- Oh.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.731
It's a flying fish, right?

21:03.880 --> 21:06.167
Yeah, that's what she said.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.168
What a beautiful day, huh?

21:10.520 --> 21:13.603
I love how the light
comes through the trees.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.804
I always dreamed
of going overseas to Europe

21:19.000 --> 21:22.686
and learning different languages,
meeting new people.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.884
Eating my way through Italy.

21:27.320 --> 21:30.449
I've never even made it
over the Atlantic.

21:32.360 --> 21:35.125
I'm sure you will.
You still have plenty of time.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.725
Yeah.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.680
OK, well. Thanks for the walk.

21:41.840 --> 21:44.810
- Of course. See ya.
- Bye.

21:54.120 --> 21:57.283
Detective Tierney, Boston PD.
Do you know this woman?

21:58.240 --> 21:59.605
I'm sorry, Detective...

22:00.280 --> 22:02.567
Have you seen this woman?

22:03.320 --> 22:04.765
No. Sorry.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.081
- Hi.
- Hello.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.605
Do you know this woman?

22:14.200 --> 22:16.407
- No, I don't know this woman.
- No?

22:16.600 --> 22:19.206
- She's new to the neighborhood.
- Is she?

22:22.680 --> 22:25.843
- To the beach? I don't think so.

22:28.840 --> 22:32.242
I saw you got to spend some time
with Alex and his kids.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.291
Yeah.

22:36.680 --> 22:40.082
I guess by now you heard
about what happened to his wife?

22:41.440 --> 22:43.044
It was cancer.

22:43.720 --> 22:48.009
A few years ago.
And it nearly broke Alex in half.

22:49.440 --> 22:51.807
This storm's gonna
blow over here pretty soon

22:51.960 --> 22:54.161
and all the people are gonna
be coming in from the beach

22:54.280 --> 22:56.282
and we're gonna get really busy.

23:08.040 --> 23:09.690
- Katie!

23:09.840 --> 23:11.649
Your paint's here.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.883
I had this extra can of primer in the back.
I thought maybe you might want

23:16.080 --> 23:17.241
to put that down before
you put the paint down.

23:17.400 --> 23:20.449
Oh, yeah, right.
I didn't even think about that.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.240
Let me grab my keys.
I'll give you a lift.

23:22.280 --> 23:24.567
- No, I'll be... I'm fine.
- You're gonna walk

23:24.720 --> 23:26.484
- all the way back with the cans?
- Yeah.

23:26.640 --> 23:29.007
- Are you...?
- Yep. I'm good.

23:53.440 --> 23:55.647
<i>What you been doing in there?</i>

23:55.800 --> 23:56.767
<i>Nothing.</i>

23:56.920 --> 24:01.050
<i>Nothing? Look at your hands
and look at your mouth.</i>

24:01.200 --> 24:04.443
<i>- What is that truck?</i>
<i>- I don't know, Aunt.</i>

24:04.600 --> 24:07.649
- It's Mark Twain.
<i>- Well, I know.</i>

24:07.840 --> 24:09.683
The kids love it.

24:09.880 --> 24:11.723
I can't complain.
You know, it could be worse.

24:11.880 --> 24:14.690
It could be Slayer.
I got Slayer in here.

24:14.840 --> 24:16.280
Why don't we listen to that instead?

24:16.360 --> 24:18.362
- No, this is good.
- OK.

24:18.560 --> 24:21.723
<i>The switch hovered in the air.
The peril was desperate.</i>

24:25.960 --> 24:27.485
All right.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.802
- You can just leave it there.
- No, I can run it up to...

24:41.000 --> 24:42.365
No, no, no, really, it's fine.

24:42.520 --> 24:45.729
- Thank you. Just...
- OK. I'll just leave it right there.

24:46.520 --> 24:47.931
- See ya.
- Bye.

24:48.080 --> 24:49.241
Yeah.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.009
Oh, wait, wait, I got...

24:55.840 --> 24:57.842
...some other stuff
you might need just in case.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.164
Some tape, sandpaper, scrapers,
things like that.

25:02.320 --> 25:05.961
Just tape around, sand it down before
you put the primer... you know what to do.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.451
- All right.
- Thanks.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.681
Yep.

25:29.040 --> 25:32.408
<i>He surveyed
the fence, and all gladness left him.</i>

25:32.560 --> 25:36.167
<i>And a deep melancholy
settled down upon his spirit.</i>

26:07.320 --> 26:10.051
I like this color.
It's brightening up the place.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.202
Yeah, I like it.

26:15.160 --> 26:17.766
So, you think you're
gonna stay in town for a while?

26:19.040 --> 26:20.690
Yeah, we'll see.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.891
- All right, have a good one.
- Thank you, Alex.

29:11.840 --> 29:15.083
Well, what you got there?

29:15.240 --> 29:17.163
Did you leave this
outside my house last night?

29:17.320 --> 29:18.845
Maybe.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.923
I can't take it.

29:21.080 --> 29:25.005
Well, it was just sitting in my shed.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.885
It's OK, I don't have any use for it.

29:29.480 --> 29:32.245
You know what? I just...

29:33.520 --> 29:37.525
I don't appreciate you coming
in the middle of the night to my house.

29:37.680 --> 29:42.083
And I know this is a nice gesture,
but I just... I can't accept it.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.925
- So, um...
- I don't understand.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.684
- It's not a big deal. It's just a bike.
- I know.

29:46.840 --> 29:48.888
- I see you walking back and forth...
- I didn't ask for it

29:49.040 --> 29:51.884
and I don't want it. So...

29:52.040 --> 29:54.520
Wait, I'm sorry.

29:57.240 --> 29:59.288
You know, normally when somebody
does something nice for you,

29:59.480 --> 30:01.084
you just say thank you.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.687
- I like the curtains.
- I mean...

30:04.840 --> 30:08.731
...I barely know this guy and he comes
to my house in the middle of the night,

30:08.880 --> 30:11.645
- and just leaves something...?
- Oh, Katie... Katie.

30:11.800 --> 30:15.407
Look, I know you found a place as
far away from people as you could,

30:15.560 --> 30:17.483
but you're gonna have to learn that

30:17.640 --> 30:21.167
if you're gonna live south of the
Mason-Dixon line, people give you stuff.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.244
That means stuff you don't want,
stuff you don't even need.

30:24.400 --> 30:27.768
- Trust me, there is no hidden agenda.
- No, because when you put it...

30:27.920 --> 30:31.367
And sometimes we just leave
that stuff in the front yard.

30:31.520 --> 30:33.682
I just don't want to owe him anything.

30:33.840 --> 30:36.730
It's a bike, not a kidney.

30:39.560 --> 30:41.722
So, you're saying that
I overreacted a little?

30:41.880 --> 30:45.089
Yeah. Yeah, maybe a little bit.

30:46.440 --> 30:49.125
- All right, maybe I did overreact.
- Thank you.

30:49.320 --> 30:51.448
- A little.

30:51.600 --> 30:56.242
Look, Katie, the great thing is
life is full of second chances.

31:10.320 --> 31:11.321
Hey, Alex.

31:14.280 --> 31:17.921
So... you were right.

31:18.080 --> 31:19.809
I was right? About what?

31:19.960 --> 31:23.851
I should have just said thank you.

31:24.280 --> 31:25.566
For the bike.

31:25.720 --> 31:28.963
- I'm sorry, I was really rude and...
- No, no, no, it was my fault.

31:29.120 --> 31:32.920
I should have asked you
before I did it.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.409
- Bus is here!

31:35.560 --> 31:36.960
Don't worry, it won't happen again.

31:40.040 --> 31:41.530
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

31:41.680 --> 31:44.001
- Where's your bathroom?
- Uh, straight back there.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.161
- Oh, thanks.
- Hi, Katie.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.004
- Hi.
- Can I have some popcorn?

31:47.160 --> 31:50.801
- Popcorn anywhere?
- Popcorn... is right over here.

32:15.840 --> 32:18.207
- No!
- Josh!

32:23.960 --> 32:25.325
Josh!

32:31.480 --> 32:32.970
- I hit my head!
- I know, I know!

32:33.120 --> 32:34.201
Alex, is he OK?

32:37.040 --> 32:39.850
- Get him around to the ladder.
- Lexie.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.370
You OK?
It's OK, it's OK.

32:45.320 --> 32:47.846
- It's OK.
- I hit my head!

32:48.000 --> 32:50.287
Here we go.

32:52.480 --> 32:53.845
You OK?

32:56.600 --> 32:58.648
Just stand back.

32:58.800 --> 33:01.406
How you doing? You OK?

33:01.560 --> 33:04.040
You're OK. You're OK.
Come on.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.567
Stop. Stop it.

33:08.240 --> 33:09.571
I'm fine.

33:21.360 --> 33:23.727
- Katie!
- Watch your step.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.489
Thank you.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.245
Watch your step.

33:31.080 --> 33:33.890
- Of course.

33:34.920 --> 33:36.524
Did you forget something?

33:43.200 --> 33:46.522
- You forgot your bike!

33:58.960 --> 34:00.371
Katie!

34:01.320 --> 34:03.129
See? It's not so hard.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.484
Hi, Jo!

34:38.679 --> 34:41.159
Hey, so listen, I've been
looking over this Lumpkin case and...

34:41.280 --> 34:44.011
I didn't ask you to do that.
Who asked you to do that?

34:44.159 --> 34:46.400
You know what it looks like? It looks like
his alibi might actually check out.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.841
OK, right.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.810
Lieutenant signed off on it,
the DA's office signed off on it.

34:51.960 --> 34:55.567
The case is closed.
I've got open cases to work now.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.927
I mean, the guy has three
little kids and, you know,

34:58.080 --> 34:59.650
even if there's a slight chance
he's innocent...

34:59.800 --> 35:02.246
Oh, God, don't you have like a wife

35:02.400 --> 35:05.051
or something that you
can go home and irritate?

35:11.800 --> 35:15.850
Look... no one's innocent.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.845
No one.

35:18.640 --> 35:23.328
I don't care if he killed her himself.
He was there. He knows what happened.

35:24.360 --> 35:28.081
I'm not his judge, I'm not his jury...
I'm not his maker.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.891
The job is to bring him in,
the other guys sort him out.

35:34.040 --> 35:36.566
<i>Alex, the crowds are
gonna be huge, we gotta go bigger.</i>

35:36.720 --> 35:39.041
Every year the crowds get bigger
and every year you call me

35:39.240 --> 35:40.844
freaking out that we need
to make the show bigger.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.570
I don't know how much bigger
we can make it, man.

35:42.720 --> 35:44.370
I am not freaking out.

35:44.520 --> 35:46.966
City council called and said
they're expecting 100,000 people.

35:47.160 --> 35:50.369
Now those are big city numbers,
so we need to put on a big city show.

35:50.520 --> 35:51.931
I got this new brochure I want you to see.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.560
No, no, no,
I've seen the brochure. All right?

35:54.720 --> 35:57.883
<i>No, you haven't seen the new one.
But that's not the point. The point is...</i>

35:58.040 --> 36:01.567
- Daddy, when are we going?
- Hold on. In a minute, sweetheart.

36:02.320 --> 36:05.449
Hey, Mulligan, you boys born stupid
or you had to work at it?

36:05.640 --> 36:06.721
Zip it, Luther.

36:06.880 --> 36:10.248
- I'll stop in in the next week.
<i>- Great, fine. When?</i>

36:10.400 --> 36:12.164
- No, no, no...
- Katie!

36:13.600 --> 36:15.682
- Hey.
- Hey, hold on one second.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.844
- What's up?
- Can you go to the beach with us?

36:19.000 --> 36:21.446
- Lexie. She's not...
- I don't know.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.568
- We're going to the beach.
- Yeah, I see that.

36:23.720 --> 36:26.610
- I need her to come right now!

36:26.760 --> 36:28.603
Lexie, she's not coming with us.

36:28.760 --> 36:32.765
- I want her to come!
- Actually, that sounds really nice.

36:33.760 --> 36:36.843
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.331
- What do you say?
- Yes!

36:38.480 --> 36:40.528
- - OK. All right, OK.
<i>- Alex.</i>

36:40.680 --> 36:43.809
- I gotta go. You're breaking up.
<i>- No, Alex, don't hang up on me.</i>

36:43.960 --> 36:45.166
Wait...

36:47.000 --> 36:48.240
He hung up.

36:49.120 --> 36:52.647
- Look at Roxy.
- Roxy.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.802
I think this one's Roxy.
Do you like this one?

36:54.960 --> 36:56.291
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

36:56.480 --> 36:58.482
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Should we do it?

36:58.640 --> 37:01.849
- You're a good shopper.
- Are you cool with this?

37:02.000 --> 37:05.482
- With what?
- Katie coming to the beach with us.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.005
Uh...

37:07.800 --> 37:10.121
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.245
How about you?

37:12.400 --> 37:16.325
- It's a little awkward.

37:19.840 --> 37:20.966
Line it up.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.090
Line it up.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.688
- Oh!
- All right, let's get a photo.

37:33.720 --> 37:36.166
Look up. Josh, look up.

37:40.320 --> 37:43.085
All right, you two.
Come on, let's get a photo.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.004
- All right.

37:48.480 --> 37:50.528
All right, let's take a photo here.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.842
One, two...

37:57.240 --> 37:58.605
Thank you.

38:00.640 --> 38:04.326
OK, one, two, three.

38:08.840 --> 38:11.684
- Come on, give it back!
- No, you're done.

38:27.840 --> 38:30.844
- Caught one. He caught one!
- Oh, my gosh!

38:31.000 --> 38:32.809
What do you got?

38:34.680 --> 38:37.331
Aah! My battery's dead,
hold on one second.

38:37.760 --> 38:40.331
- I lost my battery power.
- Oh, no.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.285
What happened to the fish?

38:45.440 --> 38:46.930
I don't know.

38:47.080 --> 38:48.401
What do you mean, you don't know?

38:48.520 --> 38:51.888
Just one time, could I get
a picture of you with your fish?

38:52.040 --> 38:54.202
Why do you always
have to take pictures?

38:55.640 --> 38:58.849
I don't know, Josh, because I want to be
able to remember this stuff, that's why.

38:59.640 --> 39:02.120
Try to remember without the camera.

39:05.520 --> 39:07.249
<i>What do I do about Josh?</i>

39:08.840 --> 39:10.524
He's testing me.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.804
Do you think it's just a phase?

39:13.960 --> 39:16.930
I hope so.

39:17.720 --> 39:21.122
No, I see the way he pushes your buttons.

39:21.280 --> 39:23.681
Josh was young,
but he remembers her, you know?

39:23.880 --> 39:26.850
Lexie remembers
the idea of her and...

39:27.000 --> 39:30.288
It's just... there's a difference.

39:30.440 --> 39:31.601
You know?

39:37.040 --> 39:38.724
Have you talked to him?

39:40.160 --> 39:43.130
At this point, I don't
really know what to say to him.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.689
Oh!

39:48.680 --> 39:50.682
You did a good job with this.

39:57.800 --> 39:59.802
So, why Southport?

40:01.320 --> 40:06.690
Um... Because it looks like this.
Just a clean, empty canvas.

40:06.880 --> 40:09.008
You're starting over.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.162
You know, sort of.

40:12.960 --> 40:14.849
I kinda was just...

40:15.000 --> 40:17.731
- ...looking for a change and...
- Hm.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.804
I always wanted to live
in small town, so...

40:21.680 --> 40:23.444
Well, you found one.

40:24.800 --> 40:26.689
- It is pretty small.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.851
Yeah, a little too sleepy sometimes,
if you ask me.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.006
- Well, the grass is always greener, so...
- Yeah, but it's nice. You'll like it.

40:35.200 --> 40:40.730
Are you staying or... you just passing
through, or what's your story?

40:43.720 --> 40:45.370
So many questions.

40:45.520 --> 40:47.887
Just curious.

40:48.040 --> 40:49.724
What about you?

40:49.920 --> 40:53.811
- Are you from here?
- I'm from Wilmington.

40:53.960 --> 40:56.440
We used to come here quite a bit
when I was a kid.

40:57.400 --> 40:59.004
Stayed for a few weeks, I loved it.

40:59.160 --> 41:01.686
My Uncle Roger,
the guy that I work with at the store...

41:01.840 --> 41:03.922
- Yeah.
- ...worked with him for a few weeks

41:04.080 --> 41:06.048
out of the summer...

41:06.840 --> 41:10.049
...then when we got pregnant
it just seemed like...

41:10.200 --> 41:12.282
...it seemed like the right place to stay.

41:13.640 --> 41:16.723
Mighty Josh is crushing my castle!

41:16.880 --> 41:20.282
No!

41:21.560 --> 41:24.325
One, two, three!

41:24.480 --> 41:26.482
Now let's all do Josh's face.

41:26.640 --> 41:27.721
- Ready?
- You ready?

41:27.760 --> 41:30.923
One, two, three.

41:47.600 --> 41:49.250
Well, here we are.

41:51.400 --> 41:53.607
- Thanks for coming.
- I had a great time.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.444
- It was fun.
- Thank you.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.685
- All right.
- All right.

41:57.840 --> 41:59.888
- Well, have a good night.
- You, too.

42:04.480 --> 42:07.962
Oh, hey, I forgot to ask you,
how'd your floors turn out?

42:08.680 --> 42:10.045
You want to see?

42:12.080 --> 42:13.241
All right.

42:17.760 --> 42:19.285
Wow, look at that.

42:19.440 --> 42:22.011
I wasn't too sure about the yellow,
but it looks pretty good.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.686
Yeah, thank you.

42:24.840 --> 42:28.561
Thanks to your primer
and Lexie's keen eye...

42:28.720 --> 42:30.802
- Yeah.
- ...I think it worked out.

42:30.960 --> 42:32.325
Looks like your walls need a little...

42:32.480 --> 42:34.528
- Jeez!
- Oh, my God.

42:34.680 --> 42:38.082
- Are you OK?

42:38.280 --> 42:40.203
Sorry I'm laughing.
Are you OK?

42:44.040 --> 42:46.122
What the hell just happened here?

42:46.280 --> 42:50.444
- I'm sorry, I should've told you about that.
- I just made a giant hole in your floor.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.887
- The hole was there. So you're OK.
- I can fix this.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.041
- I have...
- You're OK, right?

42:54.200 --> 42:55.880
I have a hammer
and some nails in my truck.

42:55.960 --> 42:58.008
- You're fine, you're fine.
- It would take me two minutes to...

42:58.160 --> 43:00.481
- Alex, it's...
- You don't want to leave a giant hole...

43:00.680 --> 43:03.445
- OK. Here.
- So...

43:08.480 --> 43:09.447
- So...
- All right.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.841
- I'm fine. I promise.
- I'm gonna go.

43:14.560 --> 43:15.925
Bye, Josh.

43:16.080 --> 43:17.844
- Bye.
- I had fun.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.286
That's it?

43:20.000 --> 43:24.085
- How about some manners?
- He's fine. He's fine.

43:24.240 --> 43:25.685
He's tired.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.646
Thank you, again.
I had fun.

43:29.800 --> 43:31.529
Hey, anytime.

43:32.640 --> 43:34.847
I think they had more fun
with you than me.

43:37.200 --> 43:38.201
Drive safe.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.201
Bye.

43:53.040 --> 43:54.883
Careful up there.

43:55.040 --> 43:58.726
You know, if you fall, it's not gonna
be anybody's fault but your own.

44:09.800 --> 44:12.929
That's enough, honey.
You've got enough of those already.

44:13.080 --> 44:16.402
- Come on in.
- Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am.

44:16.560 --> 44:18.210
It's me again.

44:18.360 --> 44:19.805
Mind if I come in for a moment?

44:19.960 --> 44:21.928
Actually, this is a very bad time.

44:22.080 --> 44:26.324
It's time for my husband's nap.
Dan, come on in for your nap.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.209
I understand,
I'm so sorry to bother you.

44:28.360 --> 44:29.964
I just needed to ask you
a few more questions.

44:30.120 --> 44:32.771
I answered all of your questions
about her last time.

44:32.920 --> 44:34.763
I really don't know
what you want me to say.

44:34.920 --> 44:37.685
- It's just a moment of your time...
- You wanna bring some cherries home?

44:37.840 --> 44:40.730
- No, dear, he doesn't. No.
- No, sir. Thank you.

44:43.320 --> 44:44.606
Have a good day.

45:11.680 --> 45:13.170
Here's one.

45:16.120 --> 45:19.522
Hey, Katie! Come here and you try.

45:20.880 --> 45:22.723
No, I don't really know
what I'm doing, so...

45:22.880 --> 45:25.041
- Come on, you can do it.
- Come on, it's easy.

45:25.080 --> 45:28.641
- It's tradition.
- OK. All right. What do I do?

45:28.800 --> 45:32.168
You just see a fish and you stab it.

45:32.640 --> 45:35.530
- I... I stab a fish. OK, easy.
- Yeah.

45:35.680 --> 45:38.001
- I'm your eyes.
- How do I...?

45:38.160 --> 45:39.525
Here's one right here.

45:39.680 --> 45:41.640
- Get him!
- You see it? OK, you just stab it, OK?

45:41.720 --> 45:43.563
OK, OK, I got it, I got it.

45:43.760 --> 45:46.331
Whoo!
Oh, shit, I got it!

45:48.320 --> 45:49.481
What's this?

45:50.760 --> 45:53.843
This is a gift.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.685
- This is to say thank you.
- Wha...?

45:56.840 --> 45:59.844
- Did you actually catch this?
- I speared it.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.650
You gigged it.

46:01.800 --> 46:03.564
- I gigged it? I gigged it.
- You gigged it.

46:03.720 --> 46:05.165
Josh, look at this.

46:05.360 --> 46:07.488
- She gigged it.
- Cool.

46:07.640 --> 46:09.404
- That is disgusting.
- That is...

46:09.560 --> 46:10.686
But you know what?
I can't accept it.

46:10.840 --> 46:13.161
You're gonna have to stop
doing nice things for me.

46:13.320 --> 46:15.766
Ah... Well...

46:16.520 --> 46:18.443
...you could just say thank you.

46:19.680 --> 46:21.887
OK, well, thank you,
for thank you flounder.

46:22.960 --> 46:25.327
- I'm gonna put it in the fridge.
- Yeah.

46:25.480 --> 46:27.847
- All right.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.809
Did Josh leave already?

46:29.960 --> 46:32.480
Yeah, I'll take you to soccer, sweetheart.
Go get your backpack.

46:32.600 --> 46:33.726
- OK.
- Hey, Lexie.

46:33.880 --> 46:34.881
Hi.

46:35.680 --> 46:38.331
- What about my snack?
- Uh...

46:38.520 --> 46:41.603
- I'll get you some oranges, all right?
- OK.

46:41.760 --> 46:44.491
All right, well, you'll have
to let me know how the fish is.

46:44.640 --> 46:46.927
Oh, I'm sure it'll be great.
We'll probably grill that up tonight.

46:47.080 --> 46:50.243
- Yeah? Well, good.
- Mm-hm.

46:50.400 --> 46:52.767
I don't know how to grill flounder,
but I'm sure you do.

46:52.920 --> 46:54.570
- Oh, it's pretty simple.
- Yeah?

46:54.720 --> 46:57.451
I like to go fishing in my canoe.

47:02.720 --> 47:04.131
You ever go canoeing?

47:05.680 --> 47:08.160
- Canoeing, you ever been?
- Canoeing?

47:08.320 --> 47:11.210
- Uh... no.
- I like canoeing.

47:11.360 --> 47:13.089
Where do you go?

47:14.320 --> 47:15.287
Dutchman's Creek.

47:15.440 --> 47:19.081
Dutchman's Creek, lot of gators there.
I like Walden Creek better.

47:19.240 --> 47:21.049
- Just got a new canoe.
- Hm.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.487
Anyway, there's, uh...

47:23.640 --> 47:26.723
It's not the most exciting thing in
the world, but it's beautiful out there.

47:26.880 --> 47:28.769
- You know?
- Yeah.

47:28.920 --> 47:31.571
Hey, I think I got everything I need here.

47:31.720 --> 47:34.849
Spit it out.
Get it over with, will you?

47:36.360 --> 47:39.443
- You wanna go canoeing with me?
- No price tag on it. How much is it?

47:39.600 --> 47:42.604
Yes. Yes, I would.

47:42.760 --> 47:44.728
- You would?
- Yes.

47:44.920 --> 47:47.366
- Tomorrow?
- That'd be great.

47:47.520 --> 47:48.567
OK.

47:48.760 --> 47:53.004
We should be back around six or seven.
There's plenty of food in the fridge.

47:53.160 --> 47:56.482
As you know, the kids won't be shy
about telling you what they don't like.

47:56.680 --> 47:59.047
- Well, it's gonna rain, you know?
- What?

47:59.200 --> 48:01.487
It's not gonna rain.
I checked the weather report.

48:01.640 --> 48:03.483
It said a five percent chance of rain.

48:03.640 --> 48:05.768
Yeah, well,
the weather report's wrong.

48:05.920 --> 48:07.160
They have instruments for this.

48:07.320 --> 48:09.971
Doppler, Super Doppler,
all kinds of other crap.

48:10.120 --> 48:12.566
You have an arthritic knee.

48:12.720 --> 48:15.371
It tightens up, it's gonna rain.

48:15.520 --> 48:17.602
- Don't need a Doppler or Super Doppler...
- It's not gonna rain.

48:17.760 --> 48:19.125
...to figure that out.

49:07.520 --> 49:10.205
- It's so beautiful.
- Yeah.

49:10.960 --> 49:13.247
This is probably my favorite place
in the whole world.

49:19.560 --> 49:23.201
Did you used to, um...
come here with your wife?

49:25.320 --> 49:26.606
Yeah.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.849
Does it get better? With time?

49:36.520 --> 49:39.000
Yeah, yeah.

49:40.800 --> 49:43.883
Yeah, at first, I tried to avoid
any place that we went together.

49:44.080 --> 49:46.082
I tried to forget, I tried
to put it all behind me.

49:46.240 --> 49:50.689
I tried to, you know...
just look forward.

49:52.520 --> 49:55.251
But it just didn't work.

49:55.400 --> 49:58.244
And I realized that if...

49:58.400 --> 50:00.926
...if I'm not thinking about her, who is?

50:02.760 --> 50:04.603
You know? And she didn't deserve that.

50:04.760 --> 50:06.444
She was an amazing woman
and I loved her

50:06.600 --> 50:08.489
and I want my kids to know that.

50:09.600 --> 50:11.250
I want them to know her.

50:14.280 --> 50:17.762
So... I don't know, I just...

50:21.640 --> 50:23.563
We're just keeping our heads down.

50:26.400 --> 50:30.121
Getting to play mom and dad
which is interesting.

50:31.520 --> 50:33.887
Just trying to keep it all together, really.

50:40.440 --> 50:44.047
But today with you, this is probably
the first time that I've looked up.

50:49.640 --> 50:51.483
It's a perfect day.

50:56.240 --> 50:58.004
Did you feel that?

51:00.520 --> 51:01.567
No.

51:02.920 --> 51:04.081
All right.

51:05.160 --> 51:07.970
It's just a little light shower.
It'll pass in a bit.

51:08.120 --> 51:11.090
- Yeah, just a little...
- Let's go over here.

51:14.640 --> 51:16.165
It's off in the distance.
We'll be all right.

51:16.320 --> 51:19.608
- Did you hear that?
- We're all right under here.

51:19.800 --> 51:23.168
- OK! Uh...

51:23.320 --> 51:24.651
You know what?

51:25.480 --> 51:28.882
I have a better idea.
You hungry?

51:29.040 --> 51:31.486
- Yeah. OK.
- OK. All right.

51:32.160 --> 51:33.605
Come on.

51:36.680 --> 51:39.206
Oh, my gosh!

51:48.880 --> 51:50.041
Come on.

52:00.320 --> 52:02.721
Hello. How's it going?

52:03.840 --> 52:07.208
- Want to just sit here?
- Can we seat ourselves?

52:13.640 --> 52:16.166
I have a friend who's
coming back from Charlotte.

52:16.360 --> 52:17.964
He should be able to pick us up
on his way back through,

52:18.120 --> 52:20.407
but he isn't picking up his phone, so...

52:20.560 --> 52:21.971
Well, no rush.

52:22.960 --> 52:25.042
I mean, I'm happy here.

52:26.360 --> 52:27.486
- So...
- Yeah?

52:27.640 --> 52:29.165
Yeah.

52:29.320 --> 52:31.800
It's a big study. That's
what this whole book is about.

52:32.000 --> 52:36.562
What I always wondered was gorillas,
maybe the strongest animals on the planet.

52:36.720 --> 52:38.210
- Primates, anyway.
- Yeah. Mm-hm.

52:38.360 --> 52:39.805
- Don't eat meat.
- Fruits and vegetables.

52:39.960 --> 52:41.564
They eat mostly kale.

52:41.760 --> 52:43.922
Yes, kale is fantastic for your body.

52:44.080 --> 52:45.570
Is there protein in kale
or is that just...?

52:45.760 --> 52:47.603
- I'm sure there is.
- Where does the strength come from?

52:47.760 --> 52:50.411
- They have <i>to...</i> it has to be genetic.
- It's genetic, but...

52:50.600 --> 52:52.409
Except what are you gonna eat?
Fruit, vegetables, nuts...

52:52.600 --> 52:56.161
I'm guessing Rhett will be here soon.
I should probably settle the...

52:57.880 --> 52:59.644
It sure cleared out.

53:00.080 --> 53:02.447
- Let me see if I can find someone.
- Thank you, by the way.

53:02.600 --> 53:04.090
You're welcome.

53:06.880 --> 53:08.564
Hello?

53:09.600 --> 53:12.968
- Hello?

53:22.360 --> 53:24.283
This song is nice.

54:04.560 --> 54:06.005
Let's go this way.

54:17.680 --> 54:19.045
What's this?

54:24.520 --> 54:26.887
- Well, thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

54:27.800 --> 54:29.404
- How's my hat?
- Very pretty.

54:29.560 --> 54:31.085
Thank you.

54:58.880 --> 55:01.167
Step away from the girl!

55:01.360 --> 55:04.728
All right, all right. It's just Rhett.

55:05.200 --> 55:06.645
- Come on.

55:06.800 --> 55:08.370
- Come on.

55:09.400 --> 55:10.970
It's just my friend.

55:11.800 --> 55:14.087
We're in for a nasty rainy season.

55:14.240 --> 55:16.322
I don't know what we're gonna do on
the Fourth if it keeps going like this.

55:16.480 --> 55:17.845
What does that mean,
the fireworks are a wash?

55:18.040 --> 55:20.566
Not a chance, buddy-boy.
The show goes on.

55:20.720 --> 55:24.281
We've been running the fireworks show
here for as long as we can remember.

55:24.440 --> 55:26.200
Biggest extravaganza
on the Eastern Seaboard.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.765
- What?
- Yeah.

55:27.920 --> 55:29.922
- That's a slight exaggeration.
- Oh, I don't think so.

55:30.080 --> 55:31.366
Maybe the lower third of North Carolina.

55:31.520 --> 55:33.488
- Oh, bullshit.
- God.

55:33.680 --> 55:37.651
Bullshit. Who does it better
than we do? Come on.

55:37.800 --> 55:40.326
- That's the answer. Thank you.
- Nobody does it better than we do, officer.

55:40.520 --> 55:43.046
- Nobody. We do it best.
- Yep.

55:47.320 --> 55:49.561
End of the line, everybody out.

55:50.080 --> 55:51.730
Pretty isolated out here.

55:51.880 --> 55:54.451
- I got neighbors. They're not too far.
- Hm.

55:56.840 --> 55:58.171
Oh.

55:59.520 --> 56:01.124
Pleasure as always, ma'am.

56:07.320 --> 56:08.651
- All right.
- OK.

56:08.840 --> 56:11.764
- Good night. Thank you.
- Oh...

56:13.160 --> 56:14.241
Come here.

57:15.360 --> 57:16.361
Shut up.

57:24.360 --> 57:25.691
- Thank you.
- You got it, buddy.

57:25.840 --> 57:27.763
- All right. I'll see you tomorrow.
- You bet.

57:27.960 --> 57:30.531
- We'll talk fireworks.
- Yes, we will.

57:35.200 --> 57:38.921
I guess your arthritis
is smarter than the both of us.

57:39.080 --> 57:42.721
Dad? Where have you been?

57:42.880 --> 57:44.644
Out having fun.

57:46.760 --> 57:48.364
Why are they still up?

57:48.960 --> 57:50.689
Probably too much candy.

57:51.520 --> 57:53.045
Hey, guys.

57:53.880 --> 57:55.723
Where have you been?

57:55.880 --> 57:58.406
I'm sorry I'm late, honey.

57:59.840 --> 58:02.844
I just... I got caught in a rainstorm

58:03.040 --> 58:06.487
and I wasn't expecting
to be out this late, OK?

58:06.640 --> 58:09.849
But you weren't here to tuck me in.

58:10.480 --> 58:11.970
I know.

58:13.560 --> 58:16.086
But I'm here now.
I can tuck you in now.

58:16.240 --> 58:19.244
Yeah. I just missed you a lot.

58:19.400 --> 58:21.687
You did? I missed you, too.

58:21.840 --> 58:23.251
I missed you more.

58:23.400 --> 58:25.129
No way. Not possible.

58:25.280 --> 58:28.011
- It is possible.

58:28.640 --> 58:29.687
Good night.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.811
Dad!
What are you doing up there?

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.724
It's Mom's place!

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.807
I'll be right there. Hold on.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:50.688
You're not supposed to be up there.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.922
I know. I know.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.923
Look, I know that it's Mom's place.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.570
And it's always gonna be her place.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:00:59.960
Not like you care.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:05.083
Hey. Hey... Come on, bud,
I'm doing the best I can, all right?

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:08.164
- It's Mom's place.
- I know that it's Mom's place.

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.325
Thank you for everything.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.642
Oh, kiddo, you're welcome.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.881
Just call me when you
land somewhere safe, OK?

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:11.530
Do you promise? You take this.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.485
Be careful.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:21.045
Hey, it's me.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.726
I know I should have
called a long time ago...

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.371
...but I just wanted
to let you know that...

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.641
...I've ended up somewhere safe.

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:01.648
- That's your handwriting.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.810
Now you lied to me, Mrs. Feldman.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.482
You told me you didn't know her,
but that's not the case, is it?

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:12.325
So, open the door,
we're gonna have that little talk now.

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.211
When you get a warrant,
I'll open the door.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.241
Well, don't go away,
I'll get that warrant.

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.365
I'm here for a pick up.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.850
- I don't want you to get in trouble.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.611
I just came by to see you because...

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.685
I gotta go. All right,
quit messing around and get back to work.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.931
- See you tonight!
- Bye!

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:00.246
We spent hours
talking at dinner last night.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.323
I haven't had that
much fun in a long time.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.729
Hm, to think it all started with a bike.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.689
I thought you said that
was him just being Southern.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.969
Ah, yeah, I was lying.
He was making a move.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.690
- What?

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:15.241
You know, some people
just need a little nudge.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.243
I could tell you weren't
gonna get there on your own.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.131
- Yeah, well, you're lucky it worked out.
- Yep.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.601
- You want anything?
- Oh, no, I'm good.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:57.005
So, um... I fixed the floor.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.089
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.520
Hm.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:02.250
If you wanna check it out.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.891
Yes.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.284
OK.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.124
- OK.
- OK.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.604
- Angel Cake's the fireworks.
- Oh.

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:35.649
No, they're elegant,
they don't cost as much.

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.127
They come in red, white and blue,
you're really gonna love these.

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:40.520
I think we should go with these this year.
Take a look.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.371
Highway Patrol just faxed these docs
for you to sign, boss, if you don't mind.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.560
All right. That's fine.
Anyway... Oh, you know what?

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.404
We could go with the, uh...
What's the other one?

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.728
Black Cat Aerial Phenomenons
or the Whistling Dixies.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.042
The Whistling Dixies. I mean, they really
whistle "Dixie." How cool is that?

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.122
No, it really is.
Where did I leave that?

01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:56.406
- In the can.
- Shit, you're right.

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.688
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.081
Alex, let me get this for you.

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:07.563
- Bass, where did you put it?
- In the can.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.087
Rhett, I gotta... I forgot something
back at the house.

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.925
- What?
- I'll be back in a minute.

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.081
- Hey, hey...

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.042
I know, I know, I know.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.202
Kevin, can I see you in my office?

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:36.443
- Yeah, I'm in the middle of something...
- Now!

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.721
Oh...

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:49.200
- All right, I'll see ya later, Katie.
- All right. I'll see you tomorrow, Frankie.

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:52.122
Erin?

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.124
What is this, some kind of a joke?

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.810
What is this?

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.329
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.084
"Special bulletin, person of interest,

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:10.210
suspect murder, first degree.
Erin Tierney"?

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.491
- Who did you kill?
- No, it's not what you think.

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.563
Why don't you tell me
what I'm supposed to think then?

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:22.486
Because I see your picture on a wanted
sign saying you're a suspect for murder.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.329
Your name is Erin.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.691
Erin.

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.490
- Please, Alex, let me explain.
- I trusted you.

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:38.565
I let you into our lives,
for Godsakes, my kids.

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.724
My kids trusted you. What the hell
am I supposed to tell my kids?

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:44.002
That I was stupid,
I was a stupid young girl

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.322
that got into a relationship
with the wrong man.

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:49.643
- How am I supposed to believe that?
- Who hurt me.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.609
How am I supposed to believe anything
that comes out of your mouth?

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.842
I don't even know your first name,
for Chrissakes.

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:58.043
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.521
The last thing that I wanted to do
is hurt anybody.

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.523
- You should go.
- Especially you.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:06.571
You should go. You should
probably go before Rhett sees that.

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.926
What's up, boss?

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:17.805
You tell me.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.089
<i>What's this?</i>

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:23.208
That's... that's not what you think.

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.283
Tell me what it is.

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.963
What's in your water bottle?

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:36.642
Your water bottle, you carry it with you
everywhere you go. What's in it?

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.771
- Water.
- Yeah? Give it to me.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.731
Why?

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:54.850
As of now, you are suspended without pay,
pending internal review.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.082
I need you to hand over
your badge and your gun.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.444
Don't take the badge, boss.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:03.400
<i>Do you have any idea
how many rules you've broken?</i>

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.324
Hey, Miss Katie!

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:08.161
You know, I knew you were crazy,
but I didn't think you were stupid.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:11.528
- I need to find her.
- You don't do it like this.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:15.689
<i>You know that. You know that!</i>

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.289
I need your badge and your gun.

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.764
<i>I need to find her, Jim.</i>

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.242
Kevin, you sent out a nationwide APB.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:28.523
She's not a murderer for Chrissakes,
she's your goddamn wife.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.681
Something smells amazing.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.683
Hey, you're home early.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.649
Oh, you're killing me.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:48.320
- How was your day?
- Tiring, sweaty, hot, horrible.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:51.086
<i>Lovely. What's this for?</i>

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:54.926
What's it for?
I need an excuse to give my wife a gift?

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.809
- It's beautiful. Thank you.
- You like it?

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.564
Yeah. It's really gorgeous.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:01.246
- May I?
- Of course.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.281
<i>This is the best pie I've ever tasted.</i>

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.205
Yeah? It's a new recipe.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.647
It's so good. So good.

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.770
Thank you.
Are you done with this?

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.331
Yeah.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:29.965
You think I'm done with that?

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:38.166
No, I was just...
coming to pour you some more.

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.322
You want to say something, you say it.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.889
I don't have anything to say.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.124
You got that look.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.043
I don't have any look.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.251
What do you want from me?

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.643
Nothing. I don't want anything.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.806
<i>How many times do you
have to hear me say I'm sorry?</i>

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.330
You won't let it rest.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:23.286
Every moment of every day you
want me to apologize. You make me...

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:26.330
No, it's fine, I promise. It's fine.

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.090
I'm just gonna go put on some coffee.

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.925
- You think you can walk away from me?
- No.

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:32.525
- Huh?

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.570
- Kevin!
- What do you want from me, baby?

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:39.725
- I give you everything! Everything!

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:43.207
Stop, please. Kevin, stop, please!

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.603
- What do you want from me, huh?
- Please. Please, please...

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.403
No!

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.849
Stop! Please.

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.846
No!

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.526
- Listen to me. You listen to me.

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.927
- You know that I love you.
- Stop!

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.880
I gave you the necklace for a reason, baby!
Why did you make me do this?

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.771
- Stop fighting, stop fighting.
- Kevin!

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.527
I love you so much,
and you want to walk away from me?

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.563
- Katie, what's going on?
- I've gotta get out of here.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.801
I've been here for too long.

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:28.327
Whoa, what are you talking about?
You just got here.

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.841
It's exactly what I was afraid of, Jo.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.882
The things I've done... I can't stay.

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:38.329
OK, Katie, let's just calm down, OK?
We can figure this out. All right?

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:41.211
Wait, does Alex
know that you're leaving?

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.886
Who do you think was
the one who told me to go?

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:47.565
Alex wants nothing
to do with me anymore.

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.848
And frankly, I don't blame him.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:56.570
Look, Katie, if you run now,
you're taking the easy way out.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:00.645
The easy way?
You think this is easy for me?

01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:02.205
You obviously don't know me.

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.362
Katie, you have people here
who care about you.

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:11.209
I think that you should stay here
and face whatever this is.

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.048
Face things the way you face things?

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.046
Excuse me?

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:20.330
Come on, Jo. You know you're
stuck here and for no good reason.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.841
At least I know when
it's time for me to leave.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.287
Yeah, you're right, Katie.

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.806
But some of us don't have that choice.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.725
Good luck, Katie.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.571
Katie!

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:49.960
Excuse me.

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:53.803
Excuse me. Katie!

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:56.327
Katie! Hey.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.331
- Alex.
- Look...

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:03.086
- I can't.
- ...I'm sorry.

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:04.241
I'm sorry.

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.680
I'm so sorry. Please, just...

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.251
...just stay.

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:13.728
No. You were right.

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.360
- I have to go.

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:21.487
- He's gonna find me. He's gonna find us.
- Whoa, wait. Just tell me the truth.

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:24.291
Just tell me what happened,
and if you're in trouble,

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.727
we can get the police involved.
I can talk to Rhett.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:30.043
You don't understand, Alex,
he is the police.

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:36.368
My husband's a cop in Boston.
That's why he could do all that.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:41.521
I don't care, all right?
I'm not gonna let him hurt you anymore.

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.604
I'm not gonna let him hurt you anymore.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.884
It doesn't even matter.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:54.840
I can't put you through that.
I can't put your family through that.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.729
He's always gonna be there.

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:02.200
- He doesn't quit.
- Katie. Listen to me.

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.528
I'm in love with you.

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:08.281
I'm in love with you.

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.408
And if you stay, I promise...

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:14.363
...there's no safer place in the world
than right here with me.

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:17.730
God, I'm so scared.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:20.963
I know you are,
but you don't have to be.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.162
You don't have to be scared.

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:28.325
I love you.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:30.965
Please stay.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.524
<i>Saturday, 2:03 p.m.</i>

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:22.648
<i>Hey, Ma, it's Andy. Give me a call.</i>

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:25.121
<i>Sunday, 9:00 p.m.</i>

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:27.886
<i>Hi, this is Ernie
calling from Buffalo...</i>

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.520
<i>Monday, 11:47 a.m.</i>

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:33.411
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:36.131
<i>I know I should have
called a long time ago...</i>

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.526
<i>...but I just wanted
to let you know that...</i>

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:58.326
<i>...I've ended up somewhere safe.</i>

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:25.562
<i>Hello, you've reached
Ivan's Fish Shack,</i>

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:28.087
<i>Southport's finest waterfront café.</i>

01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:31.289
<i>We're open Tuesday through Sunday
from ten to ten,</i>

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:36.042
<i>and we're located at 631 Yacht Basin,

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:41.611
<i>Thank y'all.</i>

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:49.131
You just become dark, like there's...

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:53.050
...the life is just sucked out of you.

01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:01.042
You just felt worthless,
like there's no point.

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:07.650
And I just stuck up for him
all the time.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:10.929
'Cause it wasn't his fault. It was mine.

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:16.611
And you're completely alone.

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:23.370
It's OK.

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.204
- It's OK.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.484
You're OK now.

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.291
I've never really talked about it.

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.641
I'm so glad you're here.

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:48.127
And I am, too.

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.328
Everything's gonna be OK.

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.171
Yeah.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.204
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:17.802
You're gonna help me carry these in?

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.040
Thank you, buddy.
I appreciate it.

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.170
Listen...

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:40.008
...if there's a problem
with her being here,

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:41.810
- I want you...
- No, it's cool.

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:44.884
Seriously. I'm fine.

01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:50.085
I like her.

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:53.687
- You like her?
- Yeah.

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.402
Well, I like her, too.

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.649
I know she likes you.

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:04.285
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:20.167
Do you need any help?

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.682
Is that all?

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:41.606
You're a little small
to be running a store.

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:45.481
- My daddy runs it. I'm just helping.
- Yeah?

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:49.008
- Where's your daddy?
- Not around.

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:51.646
- Yeah, what's your name?
- Lexie.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.326
Lexie, I'm a policeman. OK?

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:56.801
And I've just driven a very long way
to be here today

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.686
and I would like to speak
with someone a little taller.

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.569
OK?

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:04.927
Where's your uniform?

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.885
- My uniform?
- Yeah.

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:12.805
Hm.

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:18.206
I'm a detective.
You know what a detective is, Lexie?

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:20.006
- No.
- No?

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:24.722
Well, detectives catch the bad guys.
That's what I do.

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:28.680
Now, also, I look for missing people.

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:32.003
That's what I'm doing here, Lexie.
I'm looking for a missing person.

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.090
Now...

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.208
...have you seen this woman?

01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:42.091
No.

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:46.651
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:49.240
You wouldn't lie to a policeman,
would you?

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:50.566
No.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:56.164
OK. OK.

01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:58.929
- How much is that?
- $1.50.

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:00.605
$1.50.

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:06.571
Two dollars.

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.647
- Thank you.
- You keep it.

01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:11.931
Bye.

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:21.967
You ready?

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:34.169
Oh! You're getting big!

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:38.121
Do policemen always wear uniforms?

01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:40.806
Uh... I'm sure they take them off
when they get home from work.

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:41.961
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:43.770
- Happy Fourth.
- Look who we have here!

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:46.685
- Hey, Lexie!
- Go get her!

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:53.284
The Southport High School
Marching Band!

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:02.765
The Southport Fire and Rescue!

01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:22.603
Here comes the <i>Kitty Hawk!</i>
First in flight, that's us, North Carolina!

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:30.366
And sponsored by the Daughters
of the American Revolution...

01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:25.721
The fireworks start at 9:00,
I should be home shortly after that.

01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:27.962
- All right?
- Can I come with you?

01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:30.248
- You wanna come with?
- Yeah, I wanna come with.

01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:33.125
- OK, yeah. Go grab your shoes.
- OK.

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:34.645
Wow.

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:39.362
Hey, and if Lexie's stomach keeps hurting,
chamomile tea usually does the trick.

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:41.761
- We have some over at the store.
- Got it.

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:43.843
- All right. You sure you're OK?
- We are good.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.081
- You got it?
- Alex.

01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:48.210
- All right, all right. Come on, kid.
- Be safe, have fun.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.286
Wanna race?

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.923
Hey, look who showed up.

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:56.811
Hey, Josh, man. We got plenty of room.

01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:59.000
All right, hold on, buddy.
Let me get in here first.

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:00.121
All right.

01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:01.964
- All right!
- Put that on.

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.680
You ready for a big night?
Want to blow some stuff up and be men?

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:07.166
All right, we're gonna do this, boys.

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:09.721
Josh, no drinking, no smoking.
You got that?

01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:11.405
Bow clear.

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:14.285
You're not gonna go climbing
around on this thing, are you?

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:23.363
- Feeling better?
- Mm-hm.

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:31.080
- All right, here we go!
- Ready?

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.726
- All right, we're hot!
- Fire in the hole!

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:48.000
- Oh, there's your precious Angel Cake.
- What did I tell you, buddy?

01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:50.891
- Angel Cake!
- Your precious Angel Cake!

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:05.970
Katie?

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:07.727
Hey.

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.530
Look, I just want to apologize

01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:11.409
- for what I said earlier.
- He's here.

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:15.410
- Who's here?
- You know who.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:51.728
You cut your hair.

01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:01.803
Kevin.
- It looks good.

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:03.849
It looks really good.

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:06.930
Thank you.

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:09.162
I found you.

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:14.370
I found you. I missed you, baby.

01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:17.768
What are you doing here?

01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:23.450
I just want to talk, you know?
I just...

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.045
I want to talk like we used to talk.

01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:27.891
We used to talk about everything,
you know?

01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:31.522
Or nothing, it didn't matter.
We just... we just talked.

01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:34.923
- I miss you so much, baby.
- OK, let's talk.

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:38.323
- Out here.
- OK.

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.444
What do you want to talk about?

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:01.404
You wanna go home?

01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:04.130
I am home.

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:07.488
What? Here?

01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:10.291
With him?

01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:12.891
Huh?

01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:18.008
I saw you today.

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:21.210
He doesn't know you like I know you.

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:25.126
- He doesn't love you like I love you.
- No, he doesn't.

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:33.531
You want me to walk away.
Is that it?

01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:37.605
Yes. Go.

01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:40.570
No, see, you don't tell me what to do.

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:49.084
You hurt me.

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:51.521
- I know.
- You kept hurting me.

01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:54.650
- I know.
- You need to go right now.

01:36:58.240 --> 01:36:59.401
Now.

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:05.248
You're making a mistake.

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.084
No, I'm not.

01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:38.764
- You scared me to death, Lex.
- But I wanted to see the fireworks.

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:40.843
I know, but we're gonna
watch them up here, OK?

01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:42.610
I don't wanna.

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:45.601
All right. This is safer.

01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:47.444
I need you to stay here for me,
OK, Lexie?

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:48.965
OK.

01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:50.886
Here.

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:56.124
- Everything's OK. OK?
- OK.

01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:58.325
I'll be right downstairs.

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:15.120
Come on, Alex, come on.

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:07.041
Oh, my God.

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:27.967
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:31.927
I'm so glad you found me.

01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.768
Take me home. Take me home.

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:38.410
What are you doing?

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.402
I want you to take me home.

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:47.405
Take me home.

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.922
No, Lexie! Lexie!

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:22.130
Watch Josh!

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:28.121
Lexie! Lexie!

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:30.566
Katie!

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:32.404
Lexie!

01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:45.404
- Dad!
- Lexie!

01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:48.450
Hold on! Hold on!

01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:54.291
Hold on, Lexie!

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:04.170
Baby, I'm here. I'm here.

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.402
Back up for me, back up for me, honey.

01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:17.371
- I gave you everything!

01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:26.326
All right. Hold on.

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.481
All right, you sit right here,

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:29.284
- sit right here.

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:31.001
Katie!

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:33.329
- No!

01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:50.043
Lexie!

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.920
Come on. I need you to jump.

01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:57.686
I need you to jump.
You can do it! Come on.

01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:01.441
Come on, honey. Come on.
Come on, baby.

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:07.090
One, two... three, come on!

01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:17.730
Please...

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:20.729
I saw you.

01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:24.566
- I'm so sorry, baby.

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:30.529
No. No! No!

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:47.283
Lexie...

01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:48.680
Lexie.

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:52.170
- Are you OK?
- Are you OK?

01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:53.685
- I'm so sorry.
- Are you OK?

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:57.925
Are you OK?
Are you OK? Are you OK?

01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.889
She's OK, she's OK.

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:02.122
You're OK.

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.685
OK.

01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:49.964
Come on.

01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:34.323
Hey, bud.
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:36.926
- It's gone.
- I know it's gone.

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:41.170
I know it's gone, but we're gonna rebuild it
just like it was before, all right?

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:45.043
I miss her.

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:49.529
I miss Mom.

01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:02.202
I miss her, too, buddy.

01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:11.328
I'm always gonna miss her.

01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:18.811
It's all right. It's OK.

01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:33.127
So you're really leaving then, huh?

01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:38.605
Yeah. I think that we both know it's...
it's time for me to go.

01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:43.481
Well, when you get a chance, call me.

01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:46.007
When you're settled,
so I know you're OK.

01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:50.768
God... will you look at that sunlight.

01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:54.923
It's incandescent today.

01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:57.845
Oh, God, it'd make a great photo.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.083
- Promise me something, Katie.
- Yeah.

01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:03.288
That you'll take a lot of pictures.

01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:07.010
You'll only regret the ones
that you didn't take.

01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:10.441
Thank you.

01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:14.169
For being such a good friend.

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:20.849
You deserve this, Katie.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.570
You belong here.

01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:06.205
Hi.

01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:11.687
So, there's a letter here.
It's for you.

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:14.571
- Oh, yeah? What is it?
- Mm-hm.

01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:23.728
I'll be over with the kids.

01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:28.811
How's it going?

01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:46.127
<i>To the woman my husband loves.</i>

01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:50.203
<i>If you're reading this
then it must be true.</i>

01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:56.008
<i>He loves you.
Beyond a shadow of a doubt, or else...</i>

01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:59.166
<i>...he wouldn't have given this to you.</i>

01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:11.090
<i>I can only hope that you feel the same
way about him as he does about you.</i>

01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:14.481
<i>But I wanted to write you a letter</i>

01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:18.850
<i>because I wanted you to know
one very, very important thing.</i>

01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:22.920
<i>I'm so glad he's found you.</i>

01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:27.842
<i>I only wish I could be there...</i>

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.482
<i>...somehow... to meet you.</i>

01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:37.169
<i>Maybe in some ways, I am.</i>

01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:46.449
<i>Outside of my husband</i>

01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:49.763
<i>and my two beautiful children...</i>

01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:54.531
<i>...you are the most
important person in the world to me.</i>

01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:02.480
<i>Because I'm gone
and they're yours now.</i>

01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:08.244
- Hey, basmati rice. The king of rices.

01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:14.128
It's OK. It's OK.

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:19.326
<i>You need to... take care of them.</i>

01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:23.801
<i>Make them laugh.</i>

01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:26.962
<i>Hold them when they cry.</i>

01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:30.727
<i>Stand up for them and...</i>

01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:34.001
<i>...teach them wrong from right.</i>

01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:42.602
<i>The thought of you... it gives me hope.</i>

01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:48.287
<i>Hope that Alex remembers
what it feels like</i>

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:51.125
<i>to be young and in love.</i>

01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:57.527
<i>Hope that Josh finds somebody
to fish with again.</i>

01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:01.605
<i>- Hope that Lexie has somebody there</i>

01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:03.842
<i>to help her on her wedding day.</i>

01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:12.250
<i>I hope that one day
my family is whole again.</i>

01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:17.567
<i>But most of all, hope that...</i>

01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:21.769
<i>...somehow, I'm there with all of you.</i>

01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:26.761
<i>Watching over all of you.</i>

01:50:27.305 --> 01:50:33.411
