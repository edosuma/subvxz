00:05.458 --> 00:07.458
(couch and TV grunting happily)

00:08.894 --> 00:10.394
(giggles, gasps)

00:10.429 --> 00:12.429
(both laughing playfully)

00:17.503 --> 00:20.003
(both panting, sighing)

00:23.309 --> 00:24.942
(grunting)

00:24.977 --> 00:27.311

00:32.914 --> 00:35.982
HOMER: Wow, an
indoor water park.

00:36.017 --> 00:38.117
Hopefully, this will put the
final nail in the coffin

00:38.152 --> 00:39.118
of lakes and rivers.

00:39.153 --> 00:40.386
Well, as a mother, I...

00:40.421 --> 00:42.288
We all know
you're a mother.

00:42.323 --> 00:45.324
As a mother,
I like that wherever I look,

00:45.360 --> 00:46.959
I can see a lifeguard.

00:48.329 --> 00:50.329
I'm finding Nemo!

00:55.003 --> 00:57.269
I saw heaven!

00:59.207 --> 01:00.172
(cheering)

01:00.208 --> 01:01.173
(grunting)

01:01.209 --> 01:02.241
My head!

01:03.711 --> 01:05.477
(groaning)

01:05.513 --> 01:06.479
(laughter)

01:06.514 --> 01:08.147
(groans)

01:08.182 --> 01:09.382
(grunts)

01:09.417 --> 01:10.750
(laughs)

01:10.785 --> 01:12.652
Mom! Bart got
my hair wet,

01:12.687 --> 01:15.354
and I wasn't ready
to get it wet yet!

01:16.391 --> 01:18.491
(hair dryer whirs)
Hmm.

01:18.526 --> 01:20.526
I'm afraid you're going
in the kiddie pool.

01:21.996 --> 01:25.564
Oh. I've had baths
that were more exciting. Baths!

01:25.600 --> 01:26.966
(kids gasping happily)

01:27.001 --> 01:29.101
Oh, my God, a plastic ring.

01:29.137 --> 01:30.736
Out of my way,
you little twerps!

01:32.507 --> 01:34.173
I want that ring.

01:34.208 --> 01:35.908
(grunting)
Ow!

01:35.943 --> 01:38.144
Hmm.

01:38.179 --> 01:40.446
Hey, uh, do you have
any waterslides

01:40.481 --> 01:42.481
for the gentleman of
leisurely proportions?

01:42.517 --> 01:43.983
Right this way, sir.

01:44.018 --> 01:46.052
This park specializes
in extra-wide

01:46.087 --> 01:49.288
double-reinforced tubing
for the modern American fatso.

01:49.323 --> 01:50.856
(chuckles):
Oh, well.

01:50.892 --> 01:53.893
Cola wars veteran
coming through!

01:53.928 --> 01:56.862
Woo-hoo! I'm exercising!

01:56.898 --> 01:58.431
(laughing)

01:59.467 --> 02:00.900
(mechanical bear roars)

02:00.935 --> 02:02.234
(gunshot)

02:02.270 --> 02:04.003
Awesome.

02:04.038 --> 02:06.238
Milhouse, how long
you been waiting in line?

02:06.274 --> 02:08.674
You mean you didn't
use the app last week

02:08.710 --> 02:11.009
to get your Slammin' Salmon
line number?

02:11.044 --> 02:12.912
What are you, Amish?

02:12.947 --> 02:15.047
(groans)

02:15.083 --> 02:17.616
All right,
time to thin out the herd.

02:17.652 --> 02:20.319
(grunting softly)

02:20.354 --> 02:21.487
(static crackles)

02:21.522 --> 02:22.988
(deep voice, over P.A.):
Attention, bathers,

02:23.024 --> 02:25.858
this is water park president
Cal A. Bunga.

02:25.893 --> 02:28.828
Do not panic,
but the pools are infested

02:28.863 --> 02:32.164
with those tiny fish
that swim up your wiener.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.366
Get out of the way!
(crowd clamoring, screaming)

02:34.402 --> 02:36.202
Again, do not panic.

02:36.237 --> 02:39.538
If you think a wiener fish
has entered your dingus,

02:39.574 --> 02:43.375
the only cure is to roll around
naked in the snow.

02:43.411 --> 02:45.611
(clamoring)

02:45.646 --> 02:47.646
(people gasping, groaning)

02:50.852 --> 02:53.919
Uh, Lou, I need a
big favor from you.

02:53.955 --> 02:56.956
Oh, man. I... They don't train
you for this at the academy.

02:56.991 --> 02:58.324
Well, they should.

02:58.359 --> 02:59.925
(laughing)

02:59.961 --> 03:01.193
(mechanical bear roars)

03:01.229 --> 03:02.461
(hawk screeches)

03:02.497 --> 03:03.763
(gunshot)

03:03.798 --> 03:06.332
(laughing continues)

03:06.367 --> 03:08.467
Whee! Yes!

03:09.537 --> 03:11.537
(wind whistles)

03:15.176 --> 03:16.675
(sniffs)

03:16.711 --> 03:19.145
Oh, dear God!
Bio breach!

03:20.181 --> 03:21.313
(grumbles)

03:24.352 --> 03:25.518
(shrieks)

03:27.955 --> 03:29.889
(gasps)
That poor raccoon!

03:29.924 --> 03:31.824
Isn't anyone gonna do anything?

03:31.859 --> 03:35.694
He committed nature's greatest
crime: coming inside.

03:37.532 --> 03:40.366
(grunting)

03:40.401 --> 03:42.668
No heartbeat.

03:42.703 --> 03:45.738
Finally, a chance to use
my online CPR training.

03:45.773 --> 03:47.406
(whispering):
One, two, three, four five.

03:47.441 --> 03:48.407
(blows)

03:48.442 --> 03:49.942
One, two, three, four, five.

03:49.977 --> 03:50.943
(blows)

03:50.978 --> 03:52.611
(singsongy):
Lisa has a boyfriend!

03:52.647 --> 03:54.346
Lisa has a boyfriend!

03:54.382 --> 03:56.315
Oh, a boyfriend?

03:56.350 --> 03:59.084
And raccoons
are such good providers.

03:59.120 --> 04:00.686
Come on, come on.

04:00.721 --> 04:02.755
You have so much more trash
to eat.

04:02.790 --> 04:06.091
Steal one more breath,
noble bandit. (grunts)

04:06.127 --> 04:07.927
(coughs)

04:07.962 --> 04:09.795
It worked. I saved you.

04:09.831 --> 04:10.796
(chitters)

04:10.832 --> 04:12.431
(sighs)
My first rescue.

04:12.466 --> 04:14.834
And my first real kiss.

04:14.869 --> 04:18.370
She'd have chosen me if I was
wearing a real bathing suit.

04:19.373 --> 04:20.940
(groans)

04:20.975 --> 04:24.109
For once, a life saved
at a Springfield water park,

04:24.145 --> 04:25.945
where a quick-thinking
second grader

04:25.980 --> 04:30.015
<i>performed emergency CPR</i>
<i>on a drowning nuisance animal,</i>

04:30.051 --> 04:33.886
<i>while dozens of unheroic</i>
<i>onlookers just stood around.</i>

04:33.921 --> 04:35.454
Where was Channel Six news?

04:35.489 --> 04:38.224
Filming gas pumps
and their ever-changing prices.

04:38.259 --> 04:41.493
Which accomplishes what?
I don't know.

04:43.164 --> 04:44.964
DIRECTOR:
There's eight minutes left.

04:44.999 --> 04:46.799
Uh, did we do gas prices?

04:46.834 --> 04:48.667
Yes!

04:48.703 --> 04:50.035
<i>(Ralph giggles)</i>

04:50.071 --> 04:51.704
We saw you
on the picture radio.

04:51.739 --> 04:53.706
They chyroned
your name.

04:53.741 --> 04:56.175
They described you
as "Local Girl."

04:56.210 --> 04:57.443
Hubba, hubba.

04:57.478 --> 04:59.745
They sure got that
right. (growls)

04:59.780 --> 05:02.414
Lisa, it looks like you're the
perfect student to look after

05:02.450 --> 05:04.416
Nibbles the hamster here
during spring break.

05:04.452 --> 05:05.751
I'd take him with me,

05:05.786 --> 05:07.853
but I'm doing Jell-O shots
with former students.

05:07.889 --> 05:11.357
This spring break, I'm gonna
go wild with responsibility!

05:11.392 --> 05:14.760
My dad's spending spring break
in a cage, too.

05:14.795 --> 05:18.197
And for saving that raccoon,
I got the opposite of teasing.

05:18.232 --> 05:20.566
I bet the Germans
have a word for it, like, uh,

05:20.601 --> 05:23.102
<i>gerstronkenplatzen</i>
or something. (chuckles)

05:23.137 --> 05:26.405
I wish the Germans had a word
for this terrible traffic.

05:26.440 --> 05:29.375
And so ends the moment
being about me.

05:29.410 --> 05:31.110
What's going on, Chief?

05:31.145 --> 05:32.745
Oh, nasty car crash.

05:32.780 --> 05:34.213
Can't let traffic through

05:34.248 --> 05:36.782
until the cleanup crew
mops up this mess.

05:36.817 --> 05:38.284
Which is a problem,

05:38.319 --> 05:41.453
because they're
stuck in traffic behind you.

05:41.489 --> 05:42.922
Okay, who did that?!

05:42.957 --> 05:44.456
We need to get home.

05:44.492 --> 05:46.692
I left my father-in-law
on the sofa.

05:46.727 --> 05:48.427
He's got to be turned.

05:48.462 --> 05:49.795
Yeah, well,
that ain't gonna happen.

05:49.830 --> 05:52.131
Not unless <i> you</i> clean up
this accident scene. (chuckles)

05:52.166 --> 05:53.732
Actually, seriously,
could you do that?

05:53.768 --> 05:55.434
Hmm, I don't know.

05:55.469 --> 05:57.202
I'm one of those people
who doesn't like

05:57.238 --> 06:00.105
being traumatized
by horrifying sights.

06:00.141 --> 06:02.408
Marge, do you know why
I became a cop?

06:02.443 --> 06:03.976
If you do, could you tell me?

06:04.011 --> 06:05.778
'Cause it's-it's
really dangerous.

06:05.813 --> 06:08.614
B-But these crime scene
cleanups, they're totally safe.

06:08.649 --> 06:11.283
All the bad people are dead
or, uh, at large.

06:11.319 --> 06:12.651
So give it a shot.

06:12.687 --> 06:15.955
Please. Please, Mom.

06:15.990 --> 06:17.323
Huh?

06:17.358 --> 06:19.425
Oh, all right.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:28.102 --> 06:30.502
There you go.
Spick and span.

06:31.839 --> 06:35.174
Wow, you even made the
homeless guy look nice.

06:35.209 --> 06:37.476
Yeah, still crazy though.

06:37.511 --> 06:39.011
You know, Marge,
uh, you ever want

06:39.046 --> 06:41.146
some fast extra
cash, we are always

06:41.182 --> 06:43.615
looking for crime
scene cleaner-uppers.

06:43.651 --> 06:46.352
You know what they say:
crime always pays.

06:47.555 --> 06:49.421
Plus, you can keep
any money you find,

06:49.457 --> 06:52.358
and any jewelry that
isn't monogrammed.

06:52.393 --> 06:53.393
(bicycle bell dings)

06:58.499 --> 07:00.366
Hello, little girl.

07:00.401 --> 07:03.435
Oh, does your hamster
have Tyzzer's disease?

07:03.471 --> 07:04.937
That would've
been interesting,

07:04.972 --> 07:07.873
but I swabbed him for Tyzzer's
and it came up negative.

07:07.908 --> 07:11.010
My. You certainly
know a lot about animals.

07:11.045 --> 07:12.778
That's just it, I do.

07:12.813 --> 07:14.613
I saved a raccoon's
life the other day.

07:14.648 --> 07:16.348
It was the best
feeling I've ever had.

07:16.384 --> 07:18.450
Is there any way I could
work in your office?

07:18.486 --> 07:20.953
I mean, as an
intern or anything?

07:20.988 --> 07:24.890
Oh, do you know how many people
walk in here every day

07:24.925 --> 07:26.725
looking for just such a thing?

07:26.761 --> 07:28.127
A lot, I bet.

07:28.162 --> 07:29.862
No, it's never happened.

07:29.897 --> 07:32.798
Grab a clean smock
and follow me.

07:32.833 --> 07:34.867
Oh, okay!
(giggles)

07:35.936 --> 07:37.469
I can't find a clean smock.

07:37.505 --> 07:41.306
Then your first job is
to clean the smocks.

07:41.342 --> 07:42.307
(bell dings)

07:42.343 --> 07:43.742
I'm ready, Dr. Budgie.

07:43.778 --> 07:46.712
Oh, it's a shame to ruin
such a clean smock,

07:46.747 --> 07:48.213
but, uh, let's go.

07:48.249 --> 07:50.282
Hmm.

07:50.317 --> 07:51.483
(squeals)

07:53.320 --> 07:55.154
(sputters)

07:55.189 --> 07:56.922
This is heaven.

07:56.957 --> 07:58.557
You got to help me, Doc.

07:58.592 --> 08:01.727
My pet ferret
has lost its terrible stink!

08:01.762 --> 08:03.228
Well, that won't do.

08:03.264 --> 08:05.064
Let me have a go
at jump-starting

08:05.099 --> 08:06.665
the old stink gland.

08:06.700 --> 08:09.234
Lisa, my dear,
can you restrain the ferret?

08:09.270 --> 08:11.303
It would be my honor.

08:14.141 --> 08:15.307
Clear!

08:15.342 --> 08:17.142
(electrical buzz)

08:17.178 --> 08:19.111
We have stink lines!

08:19.146 --> 08:20.979
Well done, Lisa.

08:21.015 --> 08:22.047
Heaven!

08:22.083 --> 08:24.049
(chuckles) Ew.

08:27.953 --> 08:31.488
All right,
Veggie Kibble for Daisy here.

08:31.523 --> 08:33.957
Chairman Meow
is having surgery tomorrow,

08:33.991 --> 08:35.592
so only liquid for you.

08:35.626 --> 08:37.894
And no more food for you,
Mr. Snake,

08:37.929 --> 08:40.096
until you finish
shedding your skin.

08:41.767 --> 08:43.433
Oh. You have.

08:43.467 --> 08:47.137
Dr. Budgie, I'm really enjoying
cleaning out these cages.

08:47.172 --> 08:50.640
No, really, I am, but are there
any jobs that are more exciting?

08:50.675 --> 08:52.208
Absolutely.

08:52.244 --> 08:54.010
You can hobble
these crickets.

08:54.045 --> 08:57.614
We have a hungry chameleon
who's slowing down with age,

08:57.649 --> 09:00.283
but he still loves
the thrill of the hunt.

09:00.318 --> 09:02.318
Mm.
Anything more life or deathy?

09:02.354 --> 09:04.354
I could take
the animals' temperature.

09:04.389 --> 09:06.923
I know what that means,
and I am up for it.

09:06.958 --> 09:08.992
Oh, Lisa, slow down.

09:09.027 --> 09:11.661
Do you know how many awkward
courses I had to take

09:11.696 --> 09:14.130
before they let me put
my arm inside a horse?

09:14.166 --> 09:15.498
I understand.

09:15.534 --> 09:17.801
I just feel like
I could be doing more.

09:17.836 --> 09:20.370
Oh, you remind me
of a certain young man

09:20.405 --> 09:23.339
growing up in
Stratfordshire-on-Corningwell.

09:23.375 --> 09:25.041
He, too, was impatient.

09:25.076 --> 09:27.076
Always thinking
he could do more.

09:27.112 --> 09:28.311
Was that you?

09:28.346 --> 09:31.147
No. If that was me,
I would have said "me."

09:31.183 --> 09:34.851
This eager beaver
had to leave veterinary school

09:34.886 --> 09:37.921
and become-- ugh--
a people doctor.

09:37.956 --> 09:39.255
Ooh.

09:39.291 --> 09:41.658
MAN: And with the 27th pick
of the 14th round

09:41.693 --> 09:45.061
of the NHL draft,
the Phoenix Coyotes select...

09:45.096 --> 09:47.397
Lubochuck, Lubochuck,
Lubochuck, Lubochuck.

09:47.432 --> 09:48.998
...Cédric Bélanger.

09:49.034 --> 09:50.300
But Lubochuck.

09:50.335 --> 09:52.869
Homie, I think
we need a new ceiling fan.

09:52.904 --> 09:54.771
The old one
doesn't seem safe.

09:54.806 --> 09:56.406
(electrical crackling)

09:56.441 --> 09:59.475
It's fine. And it saves us
money on haircuts.

09:59.511 --> 10:00.743
(Bart gasps)

10:00.779 --> 10:02.312
Not bad, but I miss

10:02.347 --> 10:04.447
the social aspects
of the barbershop.

10:05.917 --> 10:08.318
MAN: The St. Louis Blues
are now on the clock.

10:08.353 --> 10:10.753
Lubochuck, Lubochuck,
Lubochuck, Lubochuck.

10:10.789 --> 10:12.055
Hmm.

10:12.090 --> 10:12.722
<i>(phone rings)</i>

10:12.757 --> 10:14.123
Springfield PD.

10:14.159 --> 10:16.192
PD... police department!

10:16.228 --> 10:17.894
Ha! I just got that.

10:17.929 --> 10:20.029
Chief, Chief,
this is Marge Simpson.

10:20.065 --> 10:23.566
I think I'd like to do some of
those crime scene cleanups.

10:23.602 --> 10:24.567
Oh, great, great.

10:24.603 --> 10:26.336
Hey, I got a job for you
right here.

10:26.371 --> 10:27.770
Uh, murder-suicide.

10:27.806 --> 10:29.806
Or possibly a suicide-murder.

10:29.841 --> 10:32.408
Just bring a mop
and your imagination.

10:32.444 --> 10:34.744
Hey, it can't be worse
than what I've seen.

10:34.779 --> 10:37.814
Homer, I told you not to eat
chili out of the colander!

10:37.849 --> 10:40.250
Uh, it's pronounced
"calendar."

10:41.286 --> 10:42.919
What's the matter, little guy?

10:42.954 --> 10:44.587
You haven't touched
your berries.

10:44.623 --> 10:47.090
Do you need aphids for flavor?

10:47.125 --> 10:49.259
Mmm. Aphids.

10:49.294 --> 10:52.262
DR. BUDGIE: Lisa, could you
come here for a moment?

10:52.297 --> 10:55.131
(gasps)
At last.

10:55.166 --> 10:58.134
I'm trying to give this
Saint Bernard a shot,

10:58.169 --> 11:00.136
but my hands are
a little shaky.

11:00.171 --> 11:02.739
I had an extra gallon
of tea for lunch.

11:02.774 --> 11:04.140
Oh, my.

11:04.175 --> 11:05.842
If I hold him,
do you think

11:05.877 --> 11:08.578
you could attend to the
matter of the needle?

11:08.613 --> 11:09.812
Of course!

11:09.848 --> 11:11.314
Mm.

11:11.349 --> 11:13.283
Careful, careful.

11:13.318 --> 11:15.652
A single millimeter
either way

11:15.687 --> 11:17.520
would not make much
of a difference.

11:19.357 --> 11:20.823
LISA:
<i>Huh. Why am I not feeling</i>

11:20.859 --> 11:22.926
<i>the same rush I did</i>
<i>with the raccoon?</i>

11:22.961 --> 11:24.627
(barking)

11:24.663 --> 11:27.297
<i>(shudders)</i>
<i>There it is!</i>

11:30.468 --> 11:32.669
(humming)
Be careful, Mrs. S.

11:32.704 --> 11:36.406
I've never seen an angel-dust-
for-guns swap go so wrong.

11:36.441 --> 11:38.508
Hey, a mess is a mess.

11:41.980 --> 11:43.279
Huh?

11:48.887 --> 11:51.521
Let me start with this
filthy crime scene tape.

11:51.556 --> 11:53.556
(humming)

11:55.760 --> 11:57.827
Yarr, is the
doctor in, miss?

11:57.862 --> 12:01.064
Little Goldie here is
listing hard to starboard.

12:01.099 --> 12:04.600
I fear he may have tangled
with the wrong plastic diver.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.769
Hmm. Could be fin rot.

12:06.805 --> 12:09.505
Oh, no, not the
big F. Arr!

12:09.541 --> 12:12.675
Do what you must.
I'll say my good-byes.

12:12.711 --> 12:16.980
You were more wife to me
than any woman I ever knew.

12:17.015 --> 12:19.148
Captain, the diagnosis
of fin rot

12:19.184 --> 12:21.217
is not the death sentence
it used to be.

12:21.252 --> 12:24.420
A couple drops of medicine
in the water, and he'll be fine.

12:25.457 --> 12:26.622
Hmm.

12:27.659 --> 12:29.425
Yarr, that's amazing!

12:31.129 --> 12:34.063
Eh, I've just got one
more little problem.

12:34.099 --> 12:38.067
He, uh...
he ate me car keys. Yarr.

12:38.103 --> 12:40.069
(grunting)

12:40.105 --> 12:43.339
Hurry, Doc! His lungs
are full of seltzer!

12:43.375 --> 12:45.108
(sobbing)

12:45.143 --> 12:46.442
(grunting)

12:48.313 --> 12:50.947
(chattering)

12:50.982 --> 12:52.415
(grunts)

12:52.450 --> 12:54.984
Homie?
Notice anything?

12:55.020 --> 12:56.052
(beeping)

13:00.291 --> 13:01.424
(alarm beeping)

13:01.459 --> 13:04.160
Um, are you having an affair?

13:04.195 --> 13:05.862
What? No.

13:05.897 --> 13:08.398
I bought
a new ceiling fan. Huh?

13:08.433 --> 13:11.334
Ooh, I thought the air
felt a little more lively.

13:11.369 --> 13:13.002
But where did you
get the money?

13:13.038 --> 13:17.306
Actually, I made a little extra
by cleaning up crime scenes.

13:17.342 --> 13:19.242
What? Poor Marge.

13:19.277 --> 13:21.911
I heard
that can really mess you...

13:21.946 --> 13:24.781
Oh, baby,
that cool air is sweet!

13:24.816 --> 13:26.082
...up.

13:26.117 --> 13:29.018
Are you sure you're not
living a waking nightmare?

13:29.054 --> 13:30.520
No. Not one little bit.

13:30.555 --> 13:33.089
And I get the police discount
on cleaning supplies.

13:33.124 --> 13:36.259
I can finally clean
Grampa's dentures.

13:36.294 --> 13:40.263
Yeah, I got popcorn in there
from <i> Kramer vs. Kramer.</i>

13:40.298 --> 13:42.031
I was rooting
for Kramer,

13:42.067 --> 13:45.334
but was dismayed when
Kramer finally won.

13:45.370 --> 13:48.004
That's a twist I
didn't see Kramer.

13:51.076 --> 13:53.743
Happy birthday, Martin.
Where's the gift table?

13:53.778 --> 13:57.080
(chuckles)
Right over there, my friend.

13:57.115 --> 14:00.116
(humming)

14:00.151 --> 14:02.685
Haw-haw!

14:02.720 --> 14:05.121
(chicken clucking)

14:05.156 --> 14:06.156
(giggles)

14:06.191 --> 14:08.925
Some zoo.
Where are the rental strollers?

14:08.960 --> 14:10.493
Actually, it's
not so bad.

14:10.528 --> 14:12.328
The animals are healthy.

14:12.363 --> 14:15.431
A couple of paddock scrapes,
but nothing overly concerning.

14:15.467 --> 14:17.667
Oh, knock it off.
You're not a vet.

14:17.702 --> 14:19.502
You're a glorified
cage scrubber.

14:19.537 --> 14:21.504
Dr. Budgie
depends upon me!

14:21.539 --> 14:24.440
I have felt the cold breath
of kennel cough in my face.

14:24.476 --> 14:27.443
I have seen tabbies that
were more tick than cat.

14:27.479 --> 14:30.446
I know why the
caged dog scoots.

14:30.482 --> 14:33.182
So when your lizard
loses its tail,

14:33.218 --> 14:36.819
you're gonna need me to tell
you it's gonna grow back.

14:36.855 --> 14:37.820
(sighs)

14:37.856 --> 14:39.755
Want some peanuts,
Mr. Elephant?

14:39.791 --> 14:41.757
Uh, it's a goat,
not an elephant,

14:41.793 --> 14:43.326
and those are shrimp,
not peanuts.

14:43.361 --> 14:45.328
And that goat is
allergic to shrimp!

14:45.363 --> 14:48.131
Your breath smells like
"don't drink that."

14:48.166 --> 14:49.632
(worried bleat)

14:49.667 --> 14:51.467
Milhouse, give me your EpiPen!

14:51.503 --> 14:53.336
You're not
a professional.

14:53.371 --> 14:55.771
I am a self-selected
unpaid veterinary intern.

14:55.807 --> 14:58.407
Now let me
practice my craft!

15:03.081 --> 15:05.882
(bleating excitedly)

15:05.917 --> 15:07.583
Hey, he's as
good as new.

15:07.619 --> 15:09.185
Look at him play
with the kids!

15:09.220 --> 15:11.387
(kids grunting)

15:11.422 --> 15:13.289
See, Bart?
Life or death.

15:13.324 --> 15:14.891
I make the choice.

15:14.926 --> 15:17.360
Okay, time to
cut the cake.

15:20.098 --> 15:21.777
(bleats triumphantly)

15:21.778 --> 15:23.217
That's my patient.

15:26.024 --> 15:27.758
Guess what, sweetie.

15:27.793 --> 15:30.293
I'm wearing
my snuggle socks.

15:30.329 --> 15:33.296
They're compression socks
from your heart surgery.

15:33.332 --> 15:34.965
All the same...

15:35.000 --> 15:37.167
(purring)

15:37.202 --> 15:38.635
(sighs)

15:38.670 --> 15:40.270
I'm not in the mood.

15:40.305 --> 15:42.506
What?!
You've never said that before!

15:42.541 --> 15:44.508
I've thought it
three times.

15:44.543 --> 15:47.511
Each time was after a
burrito-eating contest.

15:47.546 --> 15:49.179
But I won!

15:49.214 --> 15:50.347
What's wrong?

15:50.382 --> 15:53.583
It's just that seeing
you, lying down,

15:53.619 --> 15:57.154
reminds me of this bloated
corpse I had to clean up today.

15:57.189 --> 16:00.657
Hey, I look damn good for
someone who eats the crap I do.

16:00.692 --> 16:02.859
Maybe we should
just go to sleep.

16:02.895 --> 16:05.362
I wasn't done
with my drink.

16:05.397 --> 16:08.331
Would you like
my itty-bitty booze light?

16:10.369 --> 16:12.736
I've never seen him like this.
He's so listless.

16:12.771 --> 16:15.071
Who's lost the urge
to kill?

16:15.107 --> 16:17.140
Who's lost
the urge to kill?

16:17.176 --> 16:19.876
I'll tell you what's
wrong with him: you.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.578
What? Me?!

16:21.613 --> 16:23.413
This dog is badly
behind on his shots.

16:23.449 --> 16:26.249
He's displaying the symptoms
of early onset parvo.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.185
I'm confiscating
your dog.

16:28.220 --> 16:30.387
And, you, get out!

16:30.422 --> 16:31.855
Smithers, I've
been shamed.

16:31.890 --> 16:33.924
Prepare a thimble of ice cream.

16:33.959 --> 16:36.092
Some people don't
deserve to own pets.

16:36.128 --> 16:38.261
BART:
And you get to decide who?

16:38.297 --> 16:40.564
Don't fold your
arms at me.

16:40.599 --> 16:42.265
Lis, look at yourself.

16:42.301 --> 16:45.268
You've become so arrogant,
you've forgotten who you are.

16:45.304 --> 16:47.904
And even worse,
you've forgotten Nibbles!

16:50.409 --> 16:51.842
(gasps) Nibbles!

16:51.877 --> 16:53.910
My pet! My responsibility!

16:53.946 --> 16:55.445
My homework!

16:55.481 --> 16:56.880
(gasps)

16:56.915 --> 16:58.548
Matted hair, dry tongue...

16:58.584 --> 17:00.383
Is this true, Lisa?

17:00.419 --> 17:04.020
Did you let this happen
to a creature in your care?

17:04.056 --> 17:05.789
I'm so sorry.

17:05.824 --> 17:08.358
I'm so, so sorry.

17:08.393 --> 17:11.595
Pet hamsters need to be
played with regularly,

17:11.630 --> 17:13.430
or they feel abandoned.

17:13.464 --> 17:16.066
And that can lead to
stress polyps on the heart.

17:16.101 --> 17:19.002
The heart is the
seat of love, Lisa.

17:19.037 --> 17:21.805
If you'd gone to veterinary
school, you'd know that.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.772
I've got no choice
but to operate.

17:23.809 --> 17:25.709
And I need your help.

17:25.743 --> 17:29.479
You still want me to help you
after I was so arrogant?

17:29.515 --> 17:33.149
Lisa, arrogance is
what made the British Empire.

17:33.185 --> 17:34.417
Then lost it.

17:34.453 --> 17:36.620
Then pretended it didn't happen.

17:37.422 --> 17:39.089
(monitor beeping steadily)

17:39.124 --> 17:41.091
Well, we've done
all we can.

17:41.126 --> 17:44.060
The next 24 hours
will be crucial.

17:44.096 --> 17:45.929
(monitor flatlining)
Oh, he's gone.

17:45.964 --> 17:47.831
(crying):
No, no, no.

17:47.866 --> 17:50.133
He can't be dead!

17:50.168 --> 17:52.035
He can't!

17:52.070 --> 17:56.673
I thought we could save every
animal if we just cared enough.

17:56.708 --> 17:57.908
HOMER:
<i>Okay, Marge,</i>

17:57.943 --> 17:59.976
sweetie, look at this one.

18:00.012 --> 18:03.346
See, Marge? The baby laughs
every time the toaster pops.

18:03.382 --> 18:05.348
(chuckles)
It is pretty hysterical.

18:05.384 --> 18:06.917
That's nice.

18:06.952 --> 18:10.053
Nice? Something in you
is dead, Marge,

18:10.088 --> 18:12.756
and that's one crime scene
you can't clean up.

18:12.791 --> 18:14.491
And all for a fan.

18:14.526 --> 18:16.660
A stupid ceiling fan that...

18:16.695 --> 18:18.662
Oh, man, that's refreshing.

18:18.697 --> 18:20.630
I want my Marge back.

18:20.666 --> 18:22.165
(phone rings)

18:22.200 --> 18:23.967
Hello? What is it, boy?

18:24.002 --> 18:26.336
Uh-huh. I see.

18:26.371 --> 18:27.470
Fine, Marge.

18:27.506 --> 18:30.874
You sit here, watch your
boob tube, have a beer.

18:30.909 --> 18:33.176
That's not how Homer Simpson
does things.

18:33.211 --> 18:34.878
I have to go help Lisa!

18:36.381 --> 18:37.681
Lisa?

18:37.716 --> 18:40.784
Wait! Wait, I'm
coming with you.

18:40.819 --> 18:41.785
(door closes)

18:41.820 --> 18:44.554
(phone ringing)

18:44.590 --> 18:45.889
(line ringing)

18:45.924 --> 18:47.123
No answer.

18:47.159 --> 18:49.859
I guess we got to
do this ourselves.

18:50.896 --> 18:53.496
Oh, geez.

18:53.532 --> 18:56.166
All right, get some
paper towels, boys.

18:56.201 --> 18:58.234
(chain saw buzzing)

18:59.605 --> 19:01.271
Lisa.
(sniffling)

19:01.306 --> 19:05.208
Oh, Mom, he trusted me
as only a hamster can!

19:05.243 --> 19:06.676
(crying)

19:06.712 --> 19:08.778
If there's one thing
I'll always clean up,

19:08.814 --> 19:10.814
it's my baby's tears.

19:10.849 --> 19:12.949
Oh, I should've been
here for you.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.451
You would've never let
anything happen to him.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.952
I was too busy
being dead inside...

19:15.988 --> 19:17.821
Wherever he went,
I hope they have hamster balls.

19:17.856 --> 19:19.422
...doing I don't
know what!

19:19.458 --> 19:21.424
But I'm here now,
and I'll never leave.

19:21.460 --> 19:22.592
(chuckles)

19:22.628 --> 19:24.561
Well, I'll be.

19:24.596 --> 19:27.697
Lisa's learning about death
helped Marge feel again.

19:27.733 --> 19:30.533
Yes, a perfect
dovetail.

19:30.569 --> 19:32.268
Thank you for curing
Walter Pigeon here.

19:32.304 --> 19:34.904
I can't afford to pay
you, but I can give you

19:34.940 --> 19:36.940
front row seats
to my magic show.

19:36.975 --> 19:38.308
The theme is boxing.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.442
Sounds marvelous.

19:39.478 --> 19:41.111
Oh, yeah, no.
Come on, it is.

19:42.959 --> 19:44.425
I want to thank everyone

19:44.426 --> 19:46.553
for coming to
Nibbles's funeral today.

19:46.653 --> 19:47.986
BART (over P.A.):
This is President

19:48.021 --> 19:49.220
Cal A. Bunga.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.689
On this sad occasion,

19:50.724 --> 19:53.892
the school flag
will be flying at half-ass.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.527
Bart! (groans)

19:55.562 --> 19:57.796
I know that this is
an especially hard time

19:57.831 --> 19:59.798
for the other classroom pets,

19:59.833 --> 20:03.068
including Mrs. Nibbles,
Shelly the turtle,

20:03.103 --> 20:07.172
Sally Mander, Hamilton Fish
and Willie's chicken.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.340
Willie, where is
your chicken?

20:08.375 --> 20:10.108
It was either him or me!

20:10.143 --> 20:11.242
I see.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.845
Please stand for
Nibbles's final journey.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.613

"Amazing Grace")
