11:51.544 --> 11:53.046
AS YOU HAVE
ALL SEEN,

11:53.129 --> 11:55.541
I HAVE JUST BROUGHT
A DOG BACK TO LIFE.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.122
IT'S DEVIL'S WORK!

11:57.217 --> 11:58.878
BLACK MAGIC
IS WHAT IT IS.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.801
IT IS NOT BLACK MAGIC
AND NOT DEVIL'S WORK.

12:01.888 --> 12:04.971
IT IS THE APPLICATION
OF SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES

12:05.058 --> 12:07.470
WHICH I HAVE PICKED UP
OVER THE YEARS

12:07.560 --> 12:11.394

13:11.124 --> 13:13.286
HE'S BEEN THERE
FOUR HOURS NOW.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.367
THAT PLACE FREEZES MY
INSIDES AT HIGH NOON

13:15.461 --> 13:16.792
WITH THE SUN
SHINING DOWN.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.210

13:33.980 --> 13:39.441
AND TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT,
SHE COMES BACK TO ME.

I HADN'T GONE FI\/E
MINUTES INTO THE CEREMONY

14:16.522 --> 14:18.684
BEFORE THE EARTH
STARTED TO HEAVE.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.607
SOME MIGHTY ANXIOUS
FOLKS UP THERE.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.684
MIGHTY ANXIOUS.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.612
AH, BUT IT'D DO YOUR HEART GOOD
TO SEE THEM VVIGGLING AROUND

14:25.698 --> 14:27.860
UNDER THE SOD, JUST
LIKE SOME HAPPY COLTS

14:27.950 --> 14:34.868
RARING TO
FACE LIFE AGAIN.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.948
THAT'S YOUR
BELOVED BROTHER,

14:37.043 --> 14:38.704
<i>ISN'T IT,
MR. JENSEN?</i>

14:38.795 --> 14:41.378
UH, JOHN, HE WAS KILLED
BY ACCIDENT LAST MARCH.

14:41.464 --> 14:45.128
WE HAD A GUNFIGHT IN HERE AND
HE GOT HIT BY A STRAY BULLET.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.050
<i>THE SAME SIZE
AND SHAPE AS YOU</i>

14:47.136 --> 14:49.719
WITH A KIND OF A LIMP?

14:49.806 --> 14:53.049
[glass shatters]

14:53.142 --> 14:54.803
UH...

14:54.894 --> 14:56.726
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

14:56.813 --> 14:59.771
YOUR BROTHER VVAS THE LAST
MAN BURIED, MR. JENSEN,

14:59.857 --> 15:02.474
AND THE LAST BURIED
ARE THE FIRST ONES

15:02.568 --> 15:04.309
WHO'LL BE
COMING BACK DOWN.

15:04.404 --> 15:08.238
COMING BACK DOWN?

15:08.324 --> 15:11.487
HA! I BELIEVE
THAT'S HIM COMING NOW.

15:27.802 --> 15:30.669
MR. JENSEN...

15:30.763 --> 15:33.004
IT'S YOUR OWN
BELOVED BROTHER JOHN

15:33.099 --> 15:35.431
AND A MORE DECENT,
HONORABLE CITIZEN

15:35.518 --> 15:38.510
NEVER PULLED A CORK FROM
A BOTTLE, SO I'M TOLD.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.687
[whispering] MR. GARRITY, HE
WAS A LOWDOWN THIE\/ING SKUNK.

15:41.774 --> 15:45.187
HE SPENT MORE TIME TAPPING
THE TILL AND STEALING WHISKEY

15:45.278 --> 15:47.269
THAN HE DID
WAITING ON CUSTOMERS.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.979
YOU DISHONOR THE MAN.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.110
AND HERE HE RETURNS TO
YOU FROM THE GRAVE.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.783
AND AFTER THAT UNFORTUNATE,
ACCIDENTAL BULLET

15:53.870 --> 15:56.703
THAT CAUGHT HIM
BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES.

15:56.789 --> 16:00.032
MR. GARRITY.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.491
WHAT DO YOU CHARGE

16:01.586 --> 16:03.452
TO BRING BACK
THESE DEAD PEOPLE?

16:03.546 --> 16:06.379
ROOM AND BOARD, BUT MY
MAJOR SOURCE OF INCOME

16:06.466 --> 16:07.922
IS THE PLEASURE
I DERIVE

16:08.009 --> 16:10.216
BRINGING HAPPINESS
TO MY FELLOW MAN.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.715
WELL, HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE TO INCREASE

16:12.805 --> 16:14.261
THAT SOURCE OF INCOME?

16:14.348 --> 16:16.305
YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEAK
A BIT PLAINER.

16:16.392 --> 16:19.054
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO
PUT MY BROTHER BACK?

16:19.145 --> 16:21.728
NO, THAT WOULD BE A
DIFFICULT PROCEDURE.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.316
YOU SEE, MR. JENSEN,

16:23.399 --> 16:25.140
AFTER THE RESURRECTION
HAS TAKEN PLACE

16:25.234 --> 16:26.895
IT REQUIRES
A MAXIMUM EFFORT

16:26.986 --> 16:28.977
TO MAKE THEM DIE
ALL OVER AGAIN.

16:29.071 --> 16:32.029
WELL, WOULD $100
HELP THE EFFORT?

16:32.116 --> 16:36.656
SHALL WE SAY $1,000?

16:36.746 --> 16:39.408
WELL, WHAT DOES
500 DO FOR YOU?

16:39.499 --> 16:43.584
IT WARMS ME A LITTLE
BUT I STILL FEEL DRAFTY.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.536
LET'S SETTLE FOR,
UH... 750, SHALL WE?

16:46.631 --> 16:47.792
IT'S A DEAL.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.266
HE DISAPPEARED!

17:08.361 --> 17:11.694
HE JUST PLAIN
DISAPPEARED!

17:11.781 --> 17:14.272
HE CAME WALKING
TOWARD US

17:14.367 --> 17:15.857
AND I WOULD
HAVE BET MONEY

17:15.952 --> 17:17.693
IT WAS YOUR
BROTHER JOHN.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.528
AND HE WAS WALKING
TOWARD US

17:19.622 --> 17:21.363
AND THEN HE PLUMB
DISAPPEARED!

17:21.457 --> 17:22.742
THAT'S LIFE.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.289
BUT NOW DON'T
FRET, FRIENDS.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.789
HE'LL BE FOLLOWED
BY ALL THE OTHERS.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.745
ALL THE OTHERS?

17:28.839 --> 17:33.208
INCLUDING YOUR BELOVED WIFE.
YOUR LONELY HOURS ARE OVER.

17:33.302 --> 17:36.636
<i>YOUR ZELDA WILL SOON
BE BACK WITH YOU</i>

17:36.722 --> 17:38.713
TO BRING BACK
YOUR PEACE OF MIND.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.970
NO DISRESPECT, UH...

17:41.060 --> 17:47.898
WHAT I MEAN IS THAT ZELDA WAS
THE FLOWER OF ALL WOMANHOOD

17:47.942 --> 17:51.651
BUT ON SIX DIFFERENT OCCASIONS

17:51.737 --> 17:58.074
SHE BROKE MY LEFT ARM AND
THIS POOR THING WAS IN A CAST

17:58.160 --> 18:02.654
SO MANY TIMES THAT
I DEVELOPED A LIST.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.661
YOUR POINT, MR. GOOBERMAN.

18:05.751 --> 18:10.166
OH, I WOULD HATE TO
DISTURB ZELDA'S REST

18:10.256 --> 18:14.921
SO HOW MUCH WOULD IT
COST TO PUT HER BACK?

18:15.011 --> 18:19.926
OH, THAT'S A DIFFICULT
ASSIGNMENT, MR. GOOBERMAN.

18:20.016 --> 18:21.347
UH...

18:21.434 --> 18:22.469
$500.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.267
FOR ME IT WAS $750!

18:24.353 --> 18:26.344
[gasping]

18:26.439 --> 18:27.474
I'M ASHAMED.

18:27.565 --> 18:29.021
I'M TRULY ASHAMED.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.940
YOUR OWN
DEAR BROTHER.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.860
AND YOU, GOOBERMAN,
YOUR DEAR WIFE.

18:33.946 --> 18:38.031
AS A PUBLIC OFFICIAL OF THIS
TOVVN, I APOLOGIZE FOR THESE MEN.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.405
I AM HUMILIATED. NOTHING
LESS THAN HUMILIATED!

18:41.495 --> 18:44.362
I DON'T BLAME YOU
A BIT, SHERIFF.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.949
AND I COULD
PERCEIVE IMMEDIATELY

18:47.043 --> 18:49.455
THAT YOU'RE MADE OF
STERNER STUFF.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.127
<i>I DIDN'T SEE YOU
QUAKE IN YOUR BOOTS</i>

18:51.213 --> 18:52.954
<i>JUST BECAUSE
LIGHTNING PETERSON</i>

18:53.049 --> 18:56.007
VVILL BE ONE OF THE DEPARTED
RETURNING THIS NIGHT.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.879
LIGHTNING PETERSON!

18:57.970 --> 18:59.552
<i>YOU KILLED
HIM YOURSELF,</i>

18:59.639 --> 19:00.970
<i>DIDN'T YOU, SHERIFF?</i>

19:01.057 --> 19:02.297
<i>HE WAS THE
FASTEST GUN</i>

19:02.391 --> 19:03.677
<i>IN THE TERRITORY.</i>

19:03.768 --> 19:05.884
BALDERDASH.
I SAY BALDERDASH!

19:05.978 --> 19:07.810
"LIGHTNING" PETERSON.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.514
YOU KILLED HIM ONCE, SHERIFF,
IN AN HONEST SHOVVDOVVN

19:10.608 --> 19:13.316
<i>AND IF HIS INCARCERATION
HASN'T TAUGHT HIM ANYTHING,</i>

19:13.402 --> 19:14.984
WELL, YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.153
[exclaims]

19:17.239 --> 19:18.900
SOMETHING, SHERIFF?

19:18.991 --> 19:21.574
YOU'RE GOING TO RESURRECT
THAT GUNMAN?

19:21.661 --> 19:23.072
<i>WELL, IT WAS A
MASS OPERATION.</i>

19:23.162 --> 19:25.153
AS A MATTER
OF FACT, SHERIFF,

19:25.247 --> 19:27.329
IT WILL GIVE YOU
A MARVELOUS OPPORTUNITY

19:27.416 --> 19:30.534
TO DISPEL THOSE
UGLY RUMORS I HEARD

19:30.628 --> 19:34.087
THAT YOU ACTUALLY SHOT
PETERSON IN THE BACK...

19:34.173 --> 19:36.005
LATE AT NIGHT...

19:36.092 --> 19:38.254
WHEN HE WAS
ALONE AND UNARMED

19:38.344 --> 19:41.587
AND YOU HAD SIX DEPUTIES
ALONGSIDE OF YOU.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.547
SEVEN.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.848
NOVV, I KNOVV THAT YOU FACED
UP TO HIM IN BROAD DAYLIGHT

19:45.935 --> 19:49.098
BUT THIS VVILL GIVE YOU AN
OPPORTUNITY TO SHOOT HIM DOVVN,

19:49.188 --> 19:51.270
IF NEED BE,
FACE-TO-FACE.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.190
WELL, NOW, THE FACT
IS, MR. GARRITY,

19:54.235 --> 19:59.025
I DON'T THINK THAT PETERSON
SHOULD BE RESURRECTED.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.276
ACTUALLY...

20:00.366 --> 20:03.199
HE'S A MENACE TO SOCIETY.

20:03.285 --> 20:07.700
THE FACT IS, SHERIFF...

20:07.748 --> 20:09.534
HE'S ALREADY
ON HIS WAY DOWN.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.866
LDON'T MIND
FACING UP TO HIM

20:11.919 --> 20:14.377
BUT WHY GO TO ALL
THAT TROUBLE?

20:14.422 --> 20:16.208
UH...

20:16.298 --> 20:18.084
WOULD, UH,
YOU THINK $500

20:18.175 --> 20:20.382
WOULD KEEP HIM
BACK UP THERE?

20:20.428 --> 20:21.793
LIGHTNING PETERSON?

20:21.887 --> 20:24.219
YOU DO HIM AN
INJUSTICE, SHERIFF.

20:24.265 --> 20:26.302
HE WAS QUITE A LAD
WITH THE GUN

20:26.392 --> 20:28.258
AND MIGHTY
ACTIVE AT THAT.

20:28.352 --> 20:31.094
NO, NO, NO, THIS WILL
BE A $1,200 JOB.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.565
SOLD.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.389
JENSEN, A WHOLE
BOTTLE PLEASE.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.224
HAPPEN TO SEE A SCRAWNY
LITTLE MAN OUT THERE,

20:36.318 --> 20:38.229
KINDA GIMLET-EYED.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.481

20:40.906 --> 20:41.941
RELATIVE?

20:42.032 --> 20:43.818
EX-HUSBAND.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.741
NO TIGHTER MAN E\/ER
SQUEEZED A SILVER DOLLAR.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.902
AND THE THING OF IT IS,
I'M MARRIED AGAIN.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.738
AND IF THE
TRUTH BE KNOWN,

20:49.832 --> 20:51.823
I NEVER DID CARE FOR EPHRAIM
VVHILE HE VVAS LIVING

20:51.917 --> 20:54.625
AND I DON'T SEE VVHY I SHOULD
GO THROUGH IT ALL AGAIN.

20:54.712 --> 20:57.079
WHAT WOULD I DO
WITH TWO HUSBANDS?

20:57.131 --> 20:58.417
A HUNDRED DOLLARS?

20:58.507 --> 20:59.838

21:10.978 --> 21:13.265
ASKED TO BE BURIED
WITH A BULL WHIP.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.857
THERE'S JUST NO REASON
WHY HE SHOULD...

21:14.940 --> 21:16.192
NO, NO, NO.

21:16.275 --> 21:20.610
OH, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.607
MY WIFE LOOKED
VERY PRETTY

21:22.698 --> 21:24.029
WHEN SHE WAS BURIED.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.902
COULDN'T WE KEEP
HER THAT WAY?

21:25.993 --> 21:27.700
FIVE.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.448

21:35.044 --> 21:36.034

21:38.923 --> 21:42.587
<i>[dog barking]</i>

21:45.638 --> 21:46.628

21:53.771 --> 21:55.387

21:58.776 --> 21:59.937
[laughing]

22:00.027 --> 22:02.143
OH, YOU NICE, NICE PUPPY.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.728
OH, YOU'RE A NICE DOG.

22:03.823 --> 22:06.155
I GOT A BIG BONE
IN THE WAGON FOR YOU.

22:06.242 --> 22:08.153
YOUR REWARD
FOR PLAYING DEAD.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.530
YOU'RE LATE!

22:09.620 --> 22:11.281
OH, ACE,
I COULDN'T HELP IT.

22:11.372 --> 22:13.238
THIS TOWN IS THE RIPEST PEAR
WE EVER PLUCKED.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.914
THEY COULDN'T GET RID OF
THEIR MONEYBAGS FAST ENOUGH.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.957
WHAT WAS THE TAKE?

22:17.044 --> 22:20.503
CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN YOU
EARNED ON THE STAGE, DEAR BOY.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.835
PLAYED MY PART
UNCOMMONLY WELL.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.385
UNCOMMONLY.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.334
I'VE BEEN CHECKING OVER
THE ITINERARY.

22:26.428 --> 22:27.759
OUR NEXT STOP IS TUCSON.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.758
WE'LL GET
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP,

22:29.849 --> 22:33.058
YOU GO IN THERE IN THE MORNING,
GET A LINE ON THE PLACE.

22:33.143 --> 22:35.009
<i>WE'LL SEE WHICH
OF THE DEAR DEPARTED</i>

22:35.104 --> 22:41.692
<i>YOU CAN IMITATE
TOMORROW NIGHT.</i>

22:41.735 --> 22:43.521
REAL SORRY, FRIENDS,

22:43.612 --> 22:46.354
<i>THAT I COULDN'T PERFORM
WHAT I LAID CLAIM TO,</i>

22:46.407 --> 22:52.198
SO REST IN PEACE,
ALL OF YOU.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.700
LET'S GO.

22:54.790 --> 22:58.033
OLD SPOT, NOW
COME ON OVER HERE.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.450
THERE YOU GO.

22:59.545 --> 23:00.706
YOU SIT HERE.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.370
[chuckles]

23:02.464 --> 23:03.374
GIDDY-UP.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.646
[earth rumbling]

23:37.333 --> 23:40.291
THE MAN DON'T DO
HIMSELF JUSTICE.

23:40.377 --> 23:44.462
THE ACTOR THAT PLAYED YOU
WASN'T WORTH A DARN.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.505
BUT THAT THERE GARRITY

23:46.592 --> 23:49.425
SURE CAN DO A JOB
OF RESURRECTING.

23:49.470 --> 23:52.508
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET
BACK INTO TOWN.

23:52.598 --> 23:56.182
I'VE GOT A LOT OF DRINKING
TO CATCH UP WITH.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.259
THERE'S A YELLOW SKUNK
OF A SHERIFF

23:58.312 --> 24:00.178
I AIM TO SETTLE
A SCORE WITH, TOO.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.013
AND THERE'S
A LITTLE PIPSQUEAK

24:02.107 --> 24:04.519
OF A SOT JUST WAITING
TO GET HIS ARM BROKE

24:04.610 --> 24:06.692
AND I'M JUST THE GAL
THAT CAN DO IT

24:06.779 --> 24:08.816
OR MY NAME
AIN'T ZELDA GOOBERMAN.

24:08.906 --> 24:11.614
<i>(narrator) EXIT MR. GARRITY,
A WOULD-BE CHARLATAN,</i>

24:11.700 --> 24:13.532
<i>A MAKE-BELIEVE CON MAN</i>

24:13.619 --> 24:16.486
<i>AND A SAD MISJUDGER
OF HIS OWN TALENTS.</i>

24:16.580 --> 24:19.493
<i>RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED
FROM AN EMPTY CEMETERY</i>

24:19.583 --> 24:21.620
<i>ON A DARK HILLSIDE</i>

24:21.669 --> 24:24.377
<i>THAT IS ONE OF THE SLOPES
LEADING TO THE TWILIGHT ZONE.</i>

24:27.591 --> 24:29.628
<i>(male presenter)
AND NOW, MR. SERLING.</i>

24:29.718 --> 24:31.629
THE SUBJECT NEXT TIME
IS AUTOMATION.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.176
OUR AREA OF CONCERN:

24:33.263 --> 24:35.220
THE REPLACEMENT OF MEN
BY MACHINES.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.548
IT HAPPENS TO BE NOT ONLY A
CURRENT INDUSTRIAL PHENOMENON

24:37.643 --> 24:39.475
BUT POTENTIALLY
A SIZABLE CAN OF PEAS,

24:39.561 --> 24:40.972
THAT, ONCE OPENED,
CARRIES WITH IT

24:41.063 --> 24:43.100
SOME VERY SPECIAL
STORY MATERIAL.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.648
ON THE Tl/I/lL/GHTZONE NEXT
TIME, VVE OPEN THAT CAN OF PEAS

24:45.693 --> 24:48.481
AND PRESENT A BATTLE BETWEEN
THE MEN AND THE MACHINES.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.652
RICHARD DEACON AND
PAUL NEVVLAN STAR IN

24:50.698 --> 24:52.689
"THE BRAIN CENTER
