[chuckles]

00:07.703 --> 00:09.052
so I can sit anywhere?

00:09.096 --> 00:10.227
Ooh, can I lie down?

00:10.271 --> 00:11.620
- Oh, not for takeoff, sir.

00:11.663 --> 00:13.404
- Oh, right.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.015
Oh.

00:15.058 --> 00:18.583
This is so much better than
the plane we took to Upfronts.

00:18.627 --> 00:21.543
Oh, cashews.
Fancy.

00:21.586 --> 00:24.154
- Give it up
for a true American hero.

00:24.198 --> 00:27.157
Someone who's not afraid
to speak truth to power,

00:27.201 --> 00:28.506
Dr. Julien Echo.

00:28.550 --> 00:32.336
[cheers and applause]

00:32.380 --> 00:35.644
- Thank you very much,
future President Taft.

00:35.687 --> 00:40.344
When one victim is heard,
all victims are heard!

00:40.388 --> 00:42.564
Yes--
- [sighs]

00:42.607 --> 00:44.609
He's the worst.
- He is.

00:44.653 --> 00:45.784
- And I can't believe
he's speaking

00:45.828 --> 00:47.569
at Taft's campaign rallies
like this.

00:47.612 --> 00:49.310
Thousands and thousands
of people

00:49.353 --> 00:50.789
are listening
to this joker.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.487
- We should have taken him out
when we had a chance.

00:52.530 --> 00:53.792
- Take it easy,
Trigger Finger.

00:53.836 --> 00:56.708
- Look, I grew up
with a kid like Julien too.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.145
Her name was Anastasia.

00:58.188 --> 01:00.712
And if I could
destroy her today, I would.

01:00.756 --> 01:02.584
- Okay.

01:02.627 --> 01:04.542
While Sandy plays out
his revenge fantasies,

01:04.586 --> 01:07.415
I think we should
just stay the course.

01:07.458 --> 01:08.546
Forget about Dr. Julien.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.157
Let's focus
on winning the election.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.549
- We're only one week out,

01:11.593 --> 01:13.551
and this is affecting
your poll, sir.

01:13.595 --> 01:16.641
People are feeling that
you engaging in a public feud

01:16.685 --> 01:19.470
with an average American
isn't very presidential.

01:19.514 --> 01:22.647
- Mm, Seems like you're
at a real crossroads.

01:22.691 --> 01:24.345
- I was thinking
the same thing, Randall.

01:24.388 --> 01:25.955
Reminds me of the time
I had to move in

01:25.998 --> 01:29.741
with my parents back in Tampa
when I got cut from the CFL.

01:29.785 --> 01:32.440
- This is a timely issue,
Candidate Johnson.

01:32.483 --> 01:34.311
We should really make
a decision quickly.

01:34.355 --> 01:35.834
- And we will, Casey,
you know,

01:35.878 --> 01:37.836
but sometimes
you gotta talk things out.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.360
- I agree.

01:41.362 --> 01:43.842
So you were telling me
when you got cut from the CFL,

01:43.886 --> 01:45.583
you had
your seven bucks moment.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.324
- Yeah, that's right.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.892
After I had dedicated
my life to football,

01:49.935 --> 01:53.852
that was all I had to show
for my hard work.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.289
I went back to Tampa

01:55.332 --> 01:57.378
and started working
as a trainer.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.728
Not wanting to get into
what happened in Calgary,

01:59.771 --> 02:02.557
I told my boss that I'd signed
with the Washington Redskins

02:02.600 --> 02:04.776
and this was my offseason job.

02:04.820 --> 02:07.953
- Have a good day, honey.
- You too, Mom.

02:07.997 --> 02:10.173
- See you, son.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.393
- [exhales sharply]

02:12.436 --> 02:13.524
- What'd I do?

02:13.568 --> 02:14.917
- This isn't for you.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.441
This is for the football
Canadians who hurt him.

02:17.485 --> 02:18.877
- When people signed up
for new memberships,

02:18.921 --> 02:20.792
they also got
a free training session,

02:20.836 --> 02:22.490
so I trained those new members

02:22.533 --> 02:24.709
the only way I knew how:
way too hard.

02:24.753 --> 02:26.015
You got this, Pam.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.843
You're gonna look so good
in your new sarong.

02:27.886 --> 02:31.455
- Can't wait to make
my sister-in-law so jealous.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.805
- Marianne is gonna wish
she never booked that cruise.

02:33.849 --> 02:35.372
- [grunts]

02:35.416 --> 02:37.635
- Yes! Come on!

02:37.679 --> 02:40.290
It had been weeks since
my conversation with Dany,

02:40.334 --> 02:43.815
and I kept replaying it over
and over again in my mind.

02:43.859 --> 02:46.514
- So what do you wanna do?

02:46.557 --> 02:48.820
- Maybe I should
give wrestling a try.

02:48.864 --> 02:51.823
As a kid, I told everyone
I wanted to be a wrestler,

02:51.867 --> 02:54.478
but this was the first time
I said it as an adult.

02:54.522 --> 02:55.740
And only to Dany.

02:55.784 --> 02:57.351
I hadn't told anyone else.

02:57.394 --> 02:59.396
- Sir. Sir!

02:59.440 --> 03:01.920
- Oh, oh.
Sorry about that, ma'am.

03:01.964 --> 03:03.661
Good set.
Good set.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.402
- Hey.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.012
When do the muscles happen?

03:07.056 --> 03:10.929
- Any-any chance you need
a camcorder for your vacation?

03:10.973 --> 03:13.976
I'd also gotten in on
my dad's Circuit City hustle,

03:14.019 --> 03:16.326
selling slightly-damaged
electronics

03:16.370 --> 03:18.720
instead of turning them over
to the repairs department.

03:18.763 --> 03:20.678
- Let me get this out the way.

03:20.722 --> 03:21.940
I'm not sure
if you're a wrestling fan,

03:21.984 --> 03:24.769
but Tony Atlas and I
were tag team champs.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.597
- I can't feel my arms.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.295
Can you get my checkbook
for me?

03:28.338 --> 03:29.774
It should be on the bottom.

03:29.818 --> 03:31.515
- Telling my family I wanted
to wrestle was hard

03:31.559 --> 03:34.692
because I was coming off the
greatest failure of my life.

03:34.736 --> 03:37.260
My football dream was over,

03:37.304 --> 03:40.307
and I wasn't ready to say
another big dream out loud.

03:40.350 --> 03:41.873
My mom was still
plugging away,

03:41.917 --> 03:43.440
selling vacation packages.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.486
- ...for the seven days
and six nights.

03:45.529 --> 03:48.837
- And my grandma was glued
to the O.J. Simpson trial.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.622
She watched on that big screen
TV I bought my parents

03:51.666 --> 03:54.625
back when I thought
that was just the beginning.

03:54.669 --> 03:58.716
That trial really cut into
my mom's soap opera schedule.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.675
I was struggling
with what to do,

04:00.718 --> 04:03.504
so I exerted control
over what I could

04:03.547 --> 04:07.508
and I cleaned that apartment
from top to bottom.

04:07.551 --> 04:10.424
- Honestly, not the worst way
to deal with stress.

04:10.467 --> 04:13.514
In fact, you're doing
the exact same thing now.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.733
- What?
No, I'm not.

04:15.777 --> 04:16.778
Look.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.826
[sighs]

04:26.962 --> 04:28.703
They look better like this.

04:28.746 --> 04:29.747
- Of course.

04:33.534 --> 04:33.925
.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.797
- My mind was going
a million miles an hour,

04:35.840 --> 04:36.885
and I had a lot of stuff

04:36.928 --> 04:38.408
to sort out back then.

04:38.452 --> 04:42.151
And I'm not ashamed to say
that I needed a little boost.

04:42.194 --> 04:43.370
So I went to a sports bar

04:43.413 --> 04:45.894
and I wore my old
Miami Hurricanes jersey.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.243
- Oh, okay.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.375
- Thank God.
I thought drugs.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.159
- I was hoping it was drugs.

04:50.202 --> 04:51.465

04:57.079 --> 04:58.254

04:58.298 --> 04:59.908
- You got any drink specials
on the board

04:59.951 --> 05:01.388
for a former Miami Hurricane?

05:01.431 --> 05:04.260
- Sorry. We only do specials
for Gulf War vets.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.827
- It's hard
to push back on that.

05:05.870 --> 05:09.570
[cheers]

05:09.613 --> 05:12.094
- Best value on our menu
is a Shipwreck'd Shot.

05:12.137 --> 05:14.226
It's every kind of liquor
mixed with Pepsi.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.926
- Dewey.

05:17.969 --> 05:19.580
- Yo, Carlos.

05:19.623 --> 05:21.930
I hadn't seen my old teammate,
Carlos, in a minute,

05:21.973 --> 05:25.455
so I'd invited him out
to watch the game.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.501
Almost didn't recognize you
with your shirt tucked in.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.285
- Well, I recognize you
immediately

05:29.329 --> 05:30.591
since you're wearing
your own jersey.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.984
[both laugh]

05:33.028 --> 05:36.553
- Oh man, Sapp.
- Mm-hmm.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.425
- He's in his first year,
and he's already dominating.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.992
- Hey, we knew he would.

05:41.036 --> 05:43.386
So what you got going on here?

05:43.430 --> 05:45.301
- Oh, State Farm.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.912
Oh, your boy is
a career man now.

05:47.956 --> 05:51.133
On track to being a agent
by 26.

05:51.176 --> 05:53.091
Hey, so how did it go
up in Canada?

05:53.135 --> 05:55.616
- It went well, went well.
I got cut, though.

05:55.659 --> 05:57.444
It's kind of a numbers thing.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.141
So, you know,
just staying ready,

05:59.184 --> 06:00.272
waiting for that next call.

06:00.316 --> 06:02.449
And when
the right opportunity comes,

06:02.492 --> 06:04.407
sky's the limit.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.540
- Hey.
Hang in there, bro.

06:06.583 --> 06:09.978
If football doesn't pan out,
you'll find your State Farm.

about my own path forward.

06:29.998 --> 06:31.913

06:31.956 --> 06:34.219
- The universe was
sending me a message,

06:34.263 --> 06:36.221
and it was getting louder.

06:36.265 --> 06:39.050
- Live on Pay-Per-View--

06:41.705 --> 06:45.361
- Dwayne, did you see there's a
football league in Europe now?

06:45.405 --> 06:48.233
There's a team in Hamburg.
You love hamburgers.

Calgary Stampeders.

06:59.114 --> 07:00.637
How are you doing?
- Not too bad.

07:00.681 --> 07:03.553
Listen, I'm calling
with good news.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.468
We got a spot for you
next season.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.035
- What?

07:07.078 --> 07:08.428
- Maybe on the game-day roster

07:08.471 --> 07:09.951
if things shake out
the right way.

07:09.994 --> 07:11.256
I can arrange a plane ticket,

07:11.300 --> 07:13.520

in a few days.

07:13.563 --> 07:16.479

I had been waiting for

07:16.523 --> 07:18.612
because it forced me
to make a choice.

07:18.655 --> 07:21.919
Coach,
I appreciate you calling,

07:21.963 --> 07:26.054
but I think it's a no.

07:26.097 --> 07:27.708
I think football's done for me.

07:27.751 --> 07:30.145
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:30.188 --> 07:32.147
- Wait, you turned him down?

07:34.105 --> 07:36.194
But he was offering you another
chance to play pro football.

07:36.238 --> 07:38.501
He was throwing you a lifeline
for your dream.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.198

07:40.242 --> 07:41.373
But, in that moment,

07:41.417 --> 07:42.940
I just felt like this was
a confirmation

07:42.984 --> 07:44.725
of everything that
I'd been thinking about.

07:44.768 --> 07:49.512

give football another shot.

I'll find someone else.

Either way, I'm doing this.

Don't have to use these.

hardest thing you've ever done.

is gonna be a walk in the park

I'm gonna put you through.

We can start right now,
if you want to.

- Can't right now.
I gotta go to work.

09:35.313 --> 09:36.880

so much breakfast, Rocky.

09:36.924 --> 09:39.709
- No one can exercise
after that many poached eggs.

09:39.753 --> 09:41.755
- Of all the things
that my dad said to me,

09:41.798 --> 09:45.541
the thing that really kicked me
in the gut was when he said,

09:45.585 --> 09:47.630
"What do you think
you have to offer?"

09:47.674 --> 09:50.024
Because what he was
really saying was,

09:50.067 --> 09:51.852
"I don't see
what you have to offer."

09:51.895 --> 09:53.897
- Well, why did he
react like that?

09:53.941 --> 09:55.856
- That's what my mom
wanted to know too.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.643
- Hey, man,
what's your deal?

10:00.687 --> 10:01.905
- "Hey, man"?

10:01.949 --> 10:04.081
- Our son is finally
chasing his dream,

10:04.125 --> 10:06.127
the right dream, this time.
You don't wanna help him?

10:06.170 --> 10:07.650
- I said I'd train him,
didn't I?

10:07.694 --> 10:09.565
- Reluctantly.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.741
- Is this his dream or yours?

10:11.785 --> 10:13.003
- Of course it's my dream!

10:13.047 --> 10:14.744
It's been my dream for him
since he was born.

10:14.788 --> 10:16.224
What's your dream for him?

10:16.267 --> 10:17.834

I got to show for it.

that life for him.

that was your experience,

it's going to be Dewey's.

Wrestling is in his blood,
from my side and yours.

He's going to be great.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.597
Maybe you'll train the greatest
champion there ever was.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.860
- He's not gonna be
greater than me.

10:51.912 --> 10:54.828

about as a kid,

10:54.871 --> 10:58.048
being in the wrestling ring,
was actually happening.

10:58.092 --> 11:00.268
It just wasn't
a wrestling ring.

11:00.311 --> 11:01.704
It was a boxing ring.

11:01.748 --> 11:02.879
- And what's the difference?

11:02.923 --> 11:04.098
- Well, the mat
is a lot stiffer,

11:04.141 --> 11:05.229
and it's got no give.

11:05.273 --> 11:06.883
Getting suplexed on that

11:06.927 --> 11:09.233
was like getting suplexed
on your living room floor,

11:09.277 --> 11:11.061
which meant
big moves were out.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.889
But that was
the only option available,

11:12.933 --> 11:15.022
so that's
where my training began.

11:15.065 --> 11:16.414
- Okay.

11:16.458 --> 11:19.330
First things first:
you gotta learn how to fall.

11:19.374 --> 11:23.160
You wanna thrust your hips,
tuck your chin, legs up,

11:23.204 --> 11:25.641
and land right there,
upper back.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.818
And smack the mat so hard
the audience can feel it.

11:34.084 --> 11:36.304
What the hell
was that nonsense?

11:36.347 --> 11:38.045
- I was trying
to pump up the crowd.

11:38.088 --> 11:40.743
- Fancy moves don't win
the crowd over.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.179
It's psychological.

11:42.223 --> 11:45.748
People can't feel your pain.
They can only see it.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.184
You gotta make them feel it.

how I showed you?

to prove a point

12:10.294 --> 12:11.469

And if I was gonna
become a wrestler,

12:13.384 --> 12:15.996
then I was gonna have
to earn it just like he did.

12:16.039 --> 12:18.302

old-school trainers back then,

12:18.346 --> 12:20.304

to break the wrestler.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.965
There's a famous Hulk Hogan

Hulk Hogan came back,

this kid's for real.

18:52.783 --> 18:54.307
was gonna tank your audition
for Pat?

to my dad's credit,

18:56.222 --> 18:58.006
he never brought
any of that into the ring.
