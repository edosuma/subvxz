07:10.888 --> 07:12.557
at everyone but himself.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.975
[sighs]

07:16.185 --> 07:17.603
Who are you performing this for, Jake?

07:17.687 --> 07:19.021
Both of you guys.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.857
Look, I want to help,
but the problem is,

07:20.940 --> 07:22.567
we have no proof of what really happened.

07:22.650 --> 07:23.901
Let me guess, their body cam footage

07:23.985 --> 07:25.486
was mysteriously corrupted.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.155
Yeah, they probably tampered with it,

07:27.238 --> 07:29.240
but between us, there was a rookie there,

07:29.323 --> 07:30.825
Janice Lee.

07:30.908 --> 07:33.828
If you can get her to confirm
your client's story,

07:33.911 --> 07:35.204
I can help you.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.081
-Here's her address.
-Great.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.542
See, Rosa, this couldn't be any easier.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.335
Frank O'Sullivan,
head of the Patrolmen's Union,

07:41.419 --> 07:43.504
and there is no way on God's green earth

07:43.588 --> 07:47.008
that you're ever talking to
anyone involved in this case.

07:47.091 --> 07:50.553
I mean… I guess it could be
a little easier.

07:53.055 --> 07:55.766
-[Rosa] Why are you here, O'Sullivan?
-Officer Lee called me,

07:55.850 --> 07:57.768
and I'm here to stop
your heartless crusade

07:57.852 --> 07:59.353
against our heroes in blue,

07:59.437 --> 08:02.648
but to be clear, all I want
is to keep our city safe

08:02.732 --> 08:04.734
and then to go home to my ma at night.

08:04.817 --> 08:05.943
You live with your mom?

08:06.027 --> 08:08.488
My ma lives with me… in her house.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.156
Do you have something against my ma?

08:10.239 --> 08:11.782
Because I'll be honest with you,

08:11.866 --> 08:14.285
there's only three things that
I love in this whole world:

08:14.368 --> 08:17.622
my ma, the NYPD, and Billy Joel.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.040
And right now, you're assaulting

08:19.123 --> 08:20.333
two of those three things.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.126
Wow. So Billy Joel made your top three?

08:22.210 --> 08:23.461
And now you've assaulted all three.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.379
Can we please just talk to Officer Lee?

08:25.463 --> 08:28.216
Look, these are nice boys
that you're going after.

08:28.299 --> 08:31.844
All the perp had to do was
show them what was in the bag,

08:31.928 --> 08:33.721
but no, no, she had to escalate things.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.306
A finger was broken.

08:35.389 --> 08:37.767
Do you understand that if
anyone else was being treated

08:37.850 --> 08:39.852
the way our brave officers
are being treated,

08:39.936 --> 08:41.437
there'd be marching in the street,

08:41.521 --> 08:42.897
which I would oppose, by the way,

08:42.980 --> 08:44.607
because marching leads to rioting,

08:44.690 --> 08:46.275
and rioting leads to looting.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.777
Okay, this doesn't seem like
it's gonna be a short rant.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.111
Yeah, we're gonna head out.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.113
[funky music plays]

08:51.197 --> 08:52.323
Hello, Captain.

08:52.406 --> 08:54.158
It's so good to see you…

08:54.242 --> 08:56.994
so, so good.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.496
What's with the bizarre eye contact

08:58.579 --> 08:59.914
and the weird way
you're talking, Santiago?

08:59.997 --> 09:01.123
Did you join a cult?

09:01.207 --> 09:03.000
-What? No.
-Are you sure?

09:03.084 --> 09:05.419
Most cult members don't realize
they're part of a cult.

09:05.503 --> 09:06.754
I'm not in a cult.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.673
I was trying to connect with you.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.508
It's a method from this book.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.176
Oh, is that one of Terry's sex books?

09:12.260 --> 09:13.761
You mean one of Scully's sex books.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.683
Ever since I came back,
you've been acting distant.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.810
-What happened to Raymy?
-Raymy?

09:20.893 --> 09:23.521
Ray and Amy, Raymy.
It's what people call us.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.398
I don't know a single person
who's ever called us that.

09:25.481 --> 09:28.359
Regardless, something
is very wrong between us.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.194
You made small talk with me yesterday.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.071
Oh… you noticed that.

09:32.154 --> 09:33.281
Of course I did.

09:33.364 --> 09:34.991
It was like a knife to my heart,

09:35.074 --> 09:37.410
which is why we have to do
the exercises in this book.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.370
Please, sir? Please?

09:39.453 --> 09:40.746
If I agree, will you go back to work?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.081
Absolutely.

09:42.164 --> 09:43.833
Fine. What's the next exercise?

09:43.916 --> 09:46.085
It is…

09:46.168 --> 09:48.087
-way too sexual.
-Wow.

09:48.170 --> 09:49.171
We're gonna have to skip around a bit

09:49.255 --> 09:51.299
to make this appropriate for work.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.467
Something seemed off to me
in O'Sullivan's rant.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.136
How red he got?

09:55.219 --> 09:56.762
Yeah, he looked like a candied
apple with a widow's peak.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.514
No, he said all the perp needed to do

09:58.598 --> 09:59.932
was show them what was in her bag,

10:00.016 --> 10:01.392
but that wasn't in the police report

10:01.475 --> 10:03.144
and Lamazar didn't know that,
so how did he?

10:03.227 --> 10:05.021
I think O'Sullivan
watched the body cam recording

10:05.104 --> 10:06.439
before it was corrupted,

10:06.522 --> 10:07.982
which means he might have
the original footage,

10:08.065 --> 10:09.275
which means if we want proof,

10:09.358 --> 10:10.568
we need to break
into the union and get it.

10:10.651 --> 10:11.944
That's a lot of ifs.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.195
And besides, we can't
break into the union.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.530
-They'd recognize us.
-No way.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.073
Just put on a big dumb watch,
some Oakleys,

10:16.157 --> 10:17.783
and a camo baseball cap.
You'll fit right in.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.452
Okay, look, as much as I would love

10:19.535 --> 10:21.537
to take on the character
of Mitchell Keith Erikkson

10:21.621 --> 10:24.040
from Toms River, New Jersey,
I can't do it.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.041
Why not? You already named him.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.083
He named himself.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.501
But I don't have a warrant,

10:27.585 --> 10:28.586
and you could be arrested
for breaking and entering.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.004
No, I think we should knock on doors

10:30.087 --> 10:31.505
and try and find a witness
to corroborate the story.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.049
You sure about that?

10:33.132 --> 10:34.175
Have you talked to the people
of New York lately?

10:34.258 --> 10:35.593
Yes, I know what you think.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.011
And obviously things are a bit tense,

10:37.094 --> 10:39.096
but I believe that people still understand

10:39.180 --> 10:40.348
that we're here to help.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.266
Nope.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.768
Yeah, I saw something.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.353
It looked kind of like this.

10:45.436 --> 10:46.771
I don't talk to pigs.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.356
Copy that.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.859
Hey, Charles. I just got a random
Venmo payment from you.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.444
Was this an accident?

10:53.527 --> 10:55.696
No, it was the only way
I could express how sorry I am

10:55.780 --> 10:57.073
for what you've had to go through.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.658
Consider it a mini reparation.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.035
Mini? I wouldn't say $10,000 is mini.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.536
$10,000!

11:02.620 --> 11:04.038
Yeah, when I saw that you sent it,

11:04.121 --> 11:05.873
I was like, this must
have been an accident,

11:05.956 --> 11:07.708
like you meant to send $100

11:07.792 --> 11:09.919
and then thought you needed
to add the cents too

11:10.002 --> 11:11.295
and then accidentally added two zeros.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.671
That's a pretty good guess

11:12.755 --> 11:14.507
as to what could have happened…
but didn't.

11:14.590 --> 11:19.220
Because I meant every last zero.

11:19.303 --> 11:20.846
I'm sure you did. Thanks, Charles.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.014
You got it.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.892
Wow, Charles, that was so nice of you.

11:24.975 --> 11:27.645
It was obviously a mistake, Scully!

11:27.728 --> 11:28.646
How many more of these are we gonna do

11:28.729 --> 11:30.064
till you realize it's pointless?

11:30.147 --> 11:31.857
Well, I don't think it's pointless.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.484
That's what I've been
trying to prove to you.

11:33.567 --> 11:34.693
Wait, I thought you said

11:34.777 --> 11:36.070
you weren't trying to prove a point.

11:36.153 --> 11:38.572
Well, yeah, but I mean,
I kind of had to say that

11:38.656 --> 11:40.699
so you'd let me work with you
and I could make my point.

11:40.783 --> 11:41.909
See, this is why
we don't hang out anymore,

11:41.992 --> 11:42.993
because you're always so defensive.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.328
Well, it's kind of hard not to be

11:44.412 --> 11:46.288
when you think I'm a bad person now.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.082
-I never said that.
-You didn't have to.

11:48.165 --> 11:49.959
Rosa, we came up together.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.460
We went to the academy together.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.212
We've had the exact same career.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.548
All we ever wanted was to be detectives.

11:55.631 --> 11:56.882
And yes, we've always known
there were problems,

11:56.966 --> 11:59.677
but we would solve them
together from the inside.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.512
So when you quit, yeah, it made me feel

12:01.595 --> 12:03.389
like you thought I was wrong for staying.

12:03.472 --> 12:06.934
Jake, my choice has nothing
to do with you.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.644
It was the hardest thing I've ever done.

12:08.727 --> 12:11.480
I gave up my career,
my friends, my whole life,

12:11.564 --> 12:13.107
but I did it

12:13.190 --> 12:14.900
because I couldn't ignore
what I was a part of anymore,

12:14.984 --> 12:17.445
couldn't ignore what the police
are doing in my community

12:17.528 --> 12:19.572
to people who look like me.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.866
I know, but not all of them, not me.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.784
This isn't about you.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.202
And this case where a Black woman

12:25.286 --> 12:27.705
was assaulted by the police

12:27.788 --> 12:29.415
has nothing to do with you either.

12:29.498 --> 12:30.791
So if you're not here to help,

12:30.875 --> 12:33.002
if you're just here
to prove a point, then,

12:33.085 --> 12:35.421
man, I don't think we should
work together anymore.

12:35.504 --> 12:37.381
And I definitely
don't think we're friends.

12:43.387 --> 12:46.056
Scully, I need your help,
but you can't tell anybody

12:46.140 --> 12:47.308
-what I'm up to.
-Oh, not a problem.

12:47.391 --> 12:48.684
I don't talk to anyone but Hitchcock.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.352
<i>And nobody where I am</i>
<i>even speaks English.</i>

12:50.436 --> 12:52.271
-Where are you?
<i>-Brazil, baby!</i>

12:52.354 --> 12:53.814
<i>I got conned by a cam girl,</i>

12:53.898 --> 12:55.774
<i>but it turns out, I love it here.</i>

12:55.858 --> 12:57.651
Okay, look, you two
are always complaining

12:57.735 --> 12:59.403
about work regulations, so I'm guessing

12:59.487 --> 13:01.322
you know your way
around the Patrolmen's Union.

13:01.405 --> 13:03.032
-I need your help to break in.
-You bet.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.201
Those bastards are everything
that's wrong with policing.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.036
<i>Their dress policy's insane.</i>

13:07.119 --> 13:08.412
<i>You have to wear a shirt at all times.</i>

13:08.496 --> 13:10.039
Yuck! Just tell me how I can get

13:10.122 --> 13:11.373
to O'Sullivan's office undetected.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.875
No problem.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.668
He goes to lunch at 12:30,
so that's your window.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.462
<i>At 12:45, the mail is delivered.</i>

13:16.545 --> 13:18.589
<i>The guard at the desk always</i>
<i>flirts with the mail woman,</i>

13:18.672 --> 13:20.174
<i>so he'll be distracted.</i>

13:20.257 --> 13:22.676
<i>Then go down the main hall.</i>
<i>This is important.</i>

13:22.760 --> 13:24.303
<i>It's your last bathroom stop</i>
<i>on the whole floor.</i>

13:24.386 --> 13:25.763
It's unisex and handicap,

13:25.846 --> 13:27.765
so you get that bad boy all to yourself.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.099
<i>Tell her about toilet paper.</i>

13:29.183 --> 13:30.351
Stop talking about bathrooms.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.436
Fine. Pee your pants. What do I care?

13:32.520 --> 13:34.813
<i>Go to the last office</i>
<i>on the right and you're there.</i>

13:34.897 --> 13:37.274
Well, that background is on brand.

13:37.358 --> 13:40.319
Yeah, Ma! I got the tickets!

13:40.402 --> 13:42.988
What do think? Front row, Ma, Billy Joel.

13:43.072 --> 13:46.075
You, me, and the poet of Long Island.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.786
Huh? No, I know.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.163
So it says to participate in a new hobby

13:51.247 --> 13:53.207
your partner has expressed interest in.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.542
Have you gotten into anything new lately?

13:54.625 --> 13:55.918
I started performing daily checks

13:56.001 --> 13:57.586
of my blood-oxygen level during COVID

13:57.670 --> 13:58.879
because I feared for my life.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.005
Oh!

14:00.089 --> 14:01.006
[device beeps]

14:01.090 --> 14:02.091
-98.
-98.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.300
We did it.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.385
We're back to being Raymond-Amy.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.011
It's Raymy.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.972
And you can't measure
our connection by blood levels.

14:08.055 --> 14:09.557
Let's do another exercise.

14:09.640 --> 14:10.641
Regulations.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.518
-Regulations.
-Regulations.

14:12.601 --> 14:13.894
Regulations.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.062
How much longer do we have to do this?

14:15.145 --> 14:16.397
It was supposed to be a meaningful word

14:16.480 --> 14:18.190
to both of us, but clearly that wasn't it.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.609
Okay, now we're supposed
to tell each other

14:20.693 --> 14:22.403
a secret no one else knows.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.071
I'll go first.

14:24.154 --> 14:27.324
I once had a sex dream about Sanjay Gupta.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.742
-This is absurd.
-I know.

14:28.826 --> 14:29.869
And it was really graphic.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.788
No, these exercises.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.039
We're not lovers.

14:34.123 --> 14:37.167
We're not even friends. We're coworkers.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.253
I'm tired of Terry's stupid book.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.796
Scully's book!

14:45.050 --> 14:46.218
I beg your pardon?

14:46.302 --> 14:48.137
Did you just say you want to bring Gary?

14:48.220 --> 14:50.723
[man] I need to speak with
my union president immediately!

14:50.806 --> 14:53.267
Ma, I gotta call you right back. Okay.

14:53.350 --> 14:56.145
-Could I help you out, sir?
-I certainly hope so, sir.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.147
My name is Mitchell Keith Erikkson,

14:58.230 --> 15:01.358
and I've just been assaulted
based solely on profession.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.277
Oh, damn it to hell, son.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.862
-Tell me what happened.
-All right.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.114
So I go to this phone store,
right, to get my screen fixed.

15:07.197 --> 15:09.783
And they say, "Yeah,
no problem, 45 minutes."

15:09.867 --> 15:11.744
So I wait, and I wait.

15:11.827 --> 15:14.788
Fifty minutes go by!

15:14.872 --> 15:16.165
Nobody helped me.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.458
-It's despicable.
-So I go back

15:17.541 --> 15:18.876
into the back room to complain,

15:18.959 --> 15:20.753
and they're all just sitting around

15:20.836 --> 15:22.421
trash-talking Billy Joel!

15:22.504 --> 15:23.923
What?

15:24.006 --> 15:25.883
They said, "Piano Man"
is his only good tune!

15:25.966 --> 15:27.885
Well, now, that's just insanity.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.346
Hey, Terry.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.139
I have to come clean,

15:32.222 --> 15:34.600
and please don't say anything
until I'm done,

15:34.683 --> 15:36.018
not that I'm trying to silence you.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.770
-I am listening.
-Just say it!

15:37.853 --> 15:39.521
The $10,000 was supposed to be $100.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.774
And I was too embarrassed
to ask for it back.

15:41.857 --> 15:44.360
Boyle, I need to come clean too.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.903
-I knew you made a mistake.
-[sighs]

15:45.986 --> 15:47.404
-I was just messing with you.
-You were?

15:47.488 --> 15:49.365
-Obviously! [laughs]
-Okay.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.367
Look, Boyle, it's great that
you're trying to do better,

15:51.450 --> 15:53.327
but the way you're doing it
is kind of messed up.

15:53.410 --> 15:55.704
If you want to do something
about these issues,

15:55.788 --> 15:57.414
you have to do it because
you think it's the right thing,

15:57.498 --> 15:59.291
not because you want me to know about it.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.834
That just makes stuff weird between us.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.252
You're right.

16:02.336 --> 16:03.712
You're right. I won't be as performative.

16:03.796 --> 16:04.922
[phone whooshes]

16:05.005 --> 16:07.132
I just donated to a great charity,

16:07.216 --> 16:08.801
but I won't tell you
which one or how much.

16:08.884 --> 16:11.136
Good for you.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.056
For Black trans women. It was $1,000.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.976
Dear Lord. I got out
of there 45 minutes ago.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.310
Why were you in there so long?

16:18.394 --> 16:19.853
O'Sullivan wouldn't let me leave

16:19.937 --> 16:21.480
until he had explained to me
why reverse racism was worse

16:21.563 --> 16:23.524
than, as he called it, classic racism.

16:23.607 --> 16:25.025
How'd you know I'd be here?

16:25.109 --> 16:26.110
I bumped into Scully,
and he told me everything.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.361
He was really worried

16:27.444 --> 16:28.487
you weren't gonna take his toilet advice.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.197
Well, thanks for saving me in there.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.407
Yeah, of course.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.449
You know I've always got your back.

16:32.533 --> 16:33.784
And I'm not trying to make a point.

16:33.867 --> 16:34.952
I'm just here to help.

16:35.035 --> 16:37.121
Well, you did, 'cause I got the footage.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.623
Oh, I'm gonna have to delete this.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.125
[laughs]

16:41.208 --> 16:42.501
Yeah.

16:42.584 --> 16:44.837
Oh, wait, you're not joking.

16:46.088 --> 16:49.299
[gasps] Oh, no. You're a villain!

16:51.135 --> 16:52.136
Why'd you delete it?

16:52.219 --> 16:53.637
You said you'd help us if we got proof.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.472
Yeah, but I didn't think
you'd get proof, get proof.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.349
I thought you just, you know, get proof.

16:57.433 --> 16:58.267
There's proof and there's proof.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.185
You got the wrong kind of proof.
I don't know how much clearer I can be.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.103
So you were never gonna help us?

17:01.186 --> 17:02.730
I am helping you.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.106
I can still get the charges
against your client dropped.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.816
Now that I saw that footage,

17:05.899 --> 17:07.192
I'll get my officers
to revise their statements.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.485
And they'll be punished?

17:08.569 --> 17:09.695
No, there's no way I can suspend them.

17:09.778 --> 17:10.946
Suspend? I thought you would fire them.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.281
[snorts]

17:12.364 --> 17:14.199
Oh, you're being serious now.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.826
Huh, I guess jokes aren't our thing.

17:15.909 --> 17:17.786
Well, if I fired them,

17:17.870 --> 17:19.788
it would trigger
the union's appeal process.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.040
PBA's grievance proceedings allow

17:21.123 --> 17:23.375
for both unions and individual officers

17:23.459 --> 17:25.210
to challenge personnel actions
by superiors.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.087
The complaint gets sent up
the chain of command

17:27.171 --> 17:28.505
till they get someone
who sides with the officers.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.507
And the courts are a nightmare.

17:30.591 --> 17:31.884
Prosecutors work closely with cops.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.343
They're not gonna jeopardize
their relationship

17:33.427 --> 17:34.845
by pursuing cases against them.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.472
All the officer has to say
is he feared for his life,

17:36.555 --> 17:37.723
and it gets thrown out.

17:37.806 --> 17:38.974
Look, we know all of this,

17:39.058 --> 17:40.559
but that doesn't mean you just give up.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.936
Okay, so say I don't give up
and I get the commissioner

17:43.020 --> 17:44.605
to agree to fire the officers.

17:44.688 --> 17:45.981
Do you know what happens next?

17:46.065 --> 17:47.941
-They'd file a countersuit.
-Yes.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.526
And the officers get paid to stay at home.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.320
Not to mention qualified immunity.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.906
And now the officers
are back on the street

17:53.989 --> 17:55.699
and I am blackballed.

17:55.783 --> 17:58.577
And then one of the only
female captains in the NYPD

17:58.660 --> 18:00.120
is forced to quit.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.164
And you don't want me gone.
I'm one of the good ones.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.957
And I know how that sounds,
but I'm not one of the bad ones

18:04.041 --> 18:05.042
who say they're one of the good ones.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.169
I'm one of the good ones who say
they're one of the good ones.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.670
Yeah, I hear it, Rosa. You can stop

18:08.754 --> 18:10.422
staring daggers at me. Let's just go.

18:10.964 --> 18:12.466
-[knock at door]
<i>-</i>[Amy] <i>Sir, do you have a minute?</i>

18:12.549 --> 18:14.218
I wanted to apologize.

18:14.301 --> 18:17.471
Being back at work has been… weird.

18:17.554 --> 18:19.807
Rosa's gone, and the world has changed.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.600
And you were the one person

18:21.683 --> 18:23.727
I thought I could count on to be the same.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.145
Always Holt.

18:25.229 --> 18:28.857
I know I've been acting crazy,
and I'm sorry.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.863
Do you know why I engaged
in small talk with you earlier?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.907
Because small talk
is for strangers and con men,

18:36.990 --> 18:38.909
and that's what I am
to you now, a stranger.

18:38.992 --> 18:42.913
No. I did it because…

18:42.996 --> 18:44.331
I am a con man.

18:45.666 --> 18:46.917
I was trying to con you

18:47.000 --> 18:48.919
into believing
everything is normal with me

18:49.002 --> 18:51.713
when… it is not.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.635
Kevin and I have separated.

18:56.718 --> 19:00.013
[gasps] Oh, my God.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.683
Why?

19:02.766 --> 19:06.770
It's been a tough year
to be a Black man…

19:06.854 --> 19:09.648
and a police captain…

19:09.731 --> 19:12.276
and a human.

19:12.359 --> 19:15.320
I've been pushed to the brink
emotionally and physically.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.281
I went into survival mode,

19:17.364 --> 19:21.285
and it seems I have…
neglected my personal life.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.078
[sighs]

19:23.162 --> 19:26.081
-Does anyone else know?
-Not here.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.041
I have successfully hidden it for months--

19:28.125 --> 19:29.710
not very well, I might add.

19:29.793 --> 19:32.212
I made small talk with Peralta
on five separate occasions,

19:32.296 --> 19:34.006
and he never even batted an eye.

19:34.089 --> 19:37.426
He just blathered on about
someone named… Wario.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.635
Yeah, he does that.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.722
But you… [chuckles]

19:41.805 --> 19:45.058
You noticed that something was off with me

19:45.142 --> 19:46.643
the very first day you returned.

19:46.727 --> 19:49.730
That just shows how well you know me.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.523
And while I'm not yet ready
to talk about it,

19:51.607 --> 19:54.776
it's nice…

19:54.860 --> 19:57.654
feeling like I'm not alone anymore.

19:57.738 --> 20:00.741
And that's thanks to you…

20:00.824 --> 20:02.910
Raymy.

20:06.663 --> 20:09.208
Just so you know, I am not Raymy.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.876
We are Raymy.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.336
-Just be glad I said it.
-Totally.

20:12.419 --> 20:14.296
Yes, I am. Thank you, sir.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.423
So those cops are just gonna
keep walking the streets

20:16.506 --> 20:18.634
doing this crap with no consequences?

20:18.717 --> 20:20.802
I'm sorry. We really tried.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.888
I guess getting the charges
dropped was something,

20:22.971 --> 20:25.307
so thanks…

20:25.390 --> 20:27.726
to Rosa because you're not a cop.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.603
I'll hook you up
with those five stars on Yelp.

20:32.773 --> 20:35.234
[sighs]

20:35.317 --> 20:37.527
-That was rough.
-Yep.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.404
Hey, so look,

20:39.488 --> 20:42.032
I'm really sorry about everything.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.867
I was projecting my insecurities onto you,

20:43.951 --> 20:45.577
and that was wrong.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.538
And I like to think I've done
a lot of good as a detective

20:48.622 --> 20:51.792
and that I can continue to do that, but…

20:55.837 --> 20:58.465
Maybe I am part of the problem.

20:58.548 --> 21:01.802
Regardless, you're dealing
with things in your own way,

21:01.885 --> 21:03.220
and I get that it's not on you

21:03.303 --> 21:05.055
to make me feel okay about my choices.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.100
Apology accepted.

21:08.183 --> 21:09.893
And just because our choices are different

21:09.977 --> 21:11.019
doesn't mean we're not family.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.187
Like <i>The Fast and the Furious.</i>

21:12.271 --> 21:13.855
-No.
-Right. No, not like that.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.941
This is different, obviously.

21:16.024 --> 21:17.401
The main point is, you think I made

21:17.484 --> 21:18.902
the right decision staying on the force.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.153
-[laughing] Jake!
-I know. I'm kidding.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.488
I don't even care what you think.

21:21.571 --> 21:23.740
Your opinion is literally
meaningless to me, loser.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.575
Yeah, now you swung too far
in the opposite direction.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.911
I felt that.
It's a hard line to walk, so…

21:27.995 --> 21:29.788
[laughs]

21:29.871 --> 21:31.290
I'll work on it.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.584
[sighs]

21:38.588 --> 21:39.423
Yeah.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.758
<i>Not a doctor. Shh.</i>
