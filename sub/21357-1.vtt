'T. S. Eliot said that

00:31.667 --> 00:36.343
'the purpose of literature
was to turn blood into ink.

00:36.375 --> 00:38.628
'Well, I tried that.

00:38.667 --> 00:42.297
'I published five collections
of poetry in eight years

00:42.333 --> 00:45.587
'and I bled like a hemophiliac.

00:45.625 --> 00:49.835
'Then, somewhere along the way,
the blood finally clotted.

00:50.083 --> 00:54.168
'Over time,
the scab became a scar

00:54.208 --> 00:57.883
'and now I can scarcely
feel the wound.

00:58.125 --> 01:01.709
'All the arteries and veins
are dried out.

01:01.750 --> 01:05.209
'I no longer turn blood
into ink.

01:05.250 --> 01:09.710
'These days, I turn whiskey
into journalism.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.629
'I haven't written a poem
since 1987.'

02:17.083 --> 02:20.667
Ah-ah-ah! Ah! Ah!

02:20.708 --> 02:22.631
Ah-ah-ah!

02:22.667 --> 02:24.465
Ah! Ah!

02:24.500 --> 02:27.709
Ah-ah-ah! Ah! Ah!

02:28.000 --> 02:30.753
Ah-ah-ah! Ah! Ah!

02:30.792 --> 02:32.886
Aaah!

02:33.125 --> 02:35.298
Aaah!

02:36.708 --> 02:37.834
Aaah!

02:38.083 --> 02:39.551
Yaaah!

02:39.583 --> 02:42.712
Aaah!

02:43.000 --> 02:44.752
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

02:45.000 --> 02:46.843
Aaah!

02:46.875 --> 02:50.334
Noble patricians,
patrons of my right,

02:50.375 --> 02:52.753
defend the justice
of my cause with arms...

02:55.000 --> 02:57.253
And, countrymen,
my loving followers...

02:57.292 --> 02:59.795
If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,

03:00.042 --> 03:02.886
were gracious
in the eyes of royal Rome,

03:03.125 --> 03:04.776
take then this passage
to the Capitol...

03:04.825 --> 03:06.719
Complete and utter crap.

03:06.750 --> 03:08.343
Shh.

03:08.375 --> 03:11.879
You're not defending
this fecal matter, are you?

03:11.917 --> 03:14.716
- To justice! Continence.
- Huargh! Huargh!

03:14.750 --> 03:17.469
- And nobility.
- Huargh!

03:24.833 --> 03:27.632
Princes, that strive
by factions and by friends...

03:30.125 --> 03:31.877
- ambitiously.
- Oh, fuck off.

03:32.125 --> 03:34.378
Will you keep your opinions
to yourself?

03:34.417 --> 03:38.718
Goes rather against the grain,
being a critic, doesn't it?

03:38.750 --> 03:40.844
Know that the people of Rome,
for whom we stand

03:41.083 --> 03:42.426
a special party,

03:42.458 --> 03:45.382
- have for... for...
- By common voice.

03:45.417 --> 03:51.254
Have, by common voice, in
election for the Roman empery...

03:51.292 --> 03:53.418
- Chosen Andronicus.
- Chosen Andronicus...

03:53.442 --> 03:55.336
- Right, that's it.
- Surnamed pius for many...

03:55.367 --> 04:00.128
Get off the stage
and find new representation!

04:00.167 --> 04:02.545
Is this part of the performance?

04:02.583 --> 04:04.802
On the contrary, madam,
this is an intervention.

04:05.042 --> 04:09.218
Where is the man responsible
for this theatrical audia?

04:09.250 --> 04:12.174
Where is Matthew Lake?

04:12.208 --> 04:14.210
- Throw him out!
- Not me, madam.

04:14.250 --> 04:16.298
It is the director
who should be ejected,

04:16.333 --> 04:18.711
then tarred and feathered,

04:18.750 --> 04:21.503
for inflicting such
loose-stooled effluent

04:21.541 --> 04:23.294
upon the paying public.

04:23.333 --> 04:26.052
Say that again.

04:30.875 --> 04:33.674
Loose... stooled...

04:35.333 --> 04:37.256
effluent.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.548
Oh, do you need the line again?

04:51.417 --> 04:52.417
Sun got it.

04:53.583 --> 04:55.677
'Oh, come on!

04:55.708 --> 04:58.632
'Get your fucking hands off me!

04:58.667 --> 05:02.843
'I haven't seen such a load
of shit on the stage

05:02.875 --> 05:05.674
'since "C0praphilia",
the musical!

05:05.708 --> 05:07.710
'Get off me! Get off.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.503
'You should be ashamed
of yourselves.'

05:15.500 --> 05:16.780
We need to put up
a strong front,

05:17.000 --> 05:20.504
but first we have to
check you in for some rehab.

05:20.542 --> 05:22.715
I can hold my drink.

05:23.833 --> 05:26.552
Ted, I'm trying to help you.

05:26.583 --> 05:28.585
This... this all...
all just needs management.

05:28.625 --> 05:30.502
Needs management!

05:30.542 --> 05:33.341
The war cry
of the brown-trousered.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.885
You know I venerate your work.

05:35.917 --> 05:38.295
I know no such thing.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.368
I know you've been told by
people cleverer than you

05:40.392 --> 05:42.861
that I'm a feather
in your greasy cap.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.550
I know my writing for you
makes you feel successful.

05:46.583 --> 05:50.463
I know you know
I could walk into any job

05:50.500 --> 05:53.253
and spark grateful tears

05:53.292 --> 05:55.636
from the illiterate
pricks in charge.

05:55.667 --> 05:58.716
I also know you took culture

05:58.750 --> 06:00.798
because you couldn't
get the news desk.

06:00.833 --> 06:04.508
You would censure me?

06:04.542 --> 06:05.984
You're the one
bringing down the tone

06:06.008 --> 06:08.257
with your mealy-mouthed mummery

06:08.292 --> 06:11.876
and your prostration before
the gods of public approval.

06:11.917 --> 06:15.217
I bet you never had a wank
that wasn't focus-grouped,

06:15.250 --> 06:19.460
you sexually craven
provincial nerd.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.834
Why don't you take your
freckled ass on a sabbatical

06:23.083 --> 06:27.338
and let a real man
edit the paper?

06:27.375 --> 06:29.401
You may have been the great
hope for British poetry

06:29.425 --> 06:30.451
once upon a forever ago,

06:30.500 --> 06:32.128
but when did you
last write anything?

06:32.167 --> 06:33.794
Huh?

06:33.833 --> 06:36.882
When... when did you last
do anything at all?

06:37.125 --> 06:38.627
I have about as much need of you

06:38.667 --> 06:42.501
as I do a fucking fountain pen.

06:44.167 --> 06:45.885
Is that all?

06:46.125 --> 06:48.219
No.

06:48.250 --> 06:50.298
Get out. You're fired.

06:54.875 --> 06:56.843
Fine.

07:00.417 --> 07:05.844
'No use denying the fact
we all feel undervalued.

07:06.083 --> 07:08.586
'To be told officially
that we are off the case

07:08.625 --> 07:11.253
'confirms our sense of being
not fully appreciated

07:11.292 --> 07:14.717
'by an insensitive world.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.128
'Paradoxically,
this increases our self-esteem

07:17.167 --> 07:20.592
'because it proves that
we were right all along,

07:20.625 --> 07:23.834
'even when what
we're proved right about

07:23.875 --> 07:27.334
'is that everyone considers us
a waste of skin.

07:29.375 --> 07:31.127
'Finding myself at leisure,

07:31.167 --> 07:33.511
'perhaps I shall have some time

07:33.542 --> 07:35.510
'to craft the burning gems
of literature

'that I was once famous for.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.381
'It was unlikely
a poem would come

'in such peaceful circumstances,

07:43.375 --> 07:44.877
'but you won't get

'So, I listed, as is my custom,

07:48.417 --> 07:51.717
'such few words
as my mood suggested.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.877
'Egregious.

'Salsify.

'The rare words
annoy the punter,

about a poet's lot.

'A painter has oils,
acrylics and pastels.

'Pity the poor bloody poet.'

Roddy?

08:33.292 --> 08:35.760
I'm afraid I can't extend
your credit, Mr. Wallace.

08:38.332 --> 08:39.424
Hell.

08:39.457 --> 08:41.631
It's on me.

08:43.875 --> 08:46.719
One of the finest phrases
in our language.

08:49.792 --> 08:51.760
Your very good health, madam.

08:51.792 --> 08:54.671
And yours.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.710
You are Ted Wallace, aren't you?

08:57.000 --> 09:00.209
You may not remember me.

09:00.250 --> 09:01.752
We haven't done the deed,
have we?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.344
I'm Jane Swann.

09:04.375 --> 09:08.175
Jane Swann. One
of the Berkshire Swanns?

09:08.208 --> 09:14.295
Cast your mind back to a small
font, a baby and a rising poet.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.627
I'm Jane Burrell,
Rebecca's daughter.

09:21.667 --> 09:24.045
Fuck my best boots!

09:27.167 --> 09:29.340
I haven't seen you since
your mother threw me out.

09:29.375 --> 09:31.719
I know.

09:31.750 --> 09:33.798
And I was always
very proud of you.

09:34.042 --> 09:35.701
Two of your poems
were set text at school.

09:35.725 --> 09:37.218
Oh, you should have written.

09:37.250 --> 09:39.423
I would have come and
gabbled at the sixth form.

09:39.458 --> 09:41.711
Well, I hoped I'd find you here.

09:41.750 --> 09:44.754
Where the last of
the semi-famous get assholed.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.844
More than semi-famous.

09:48.083 --> 09:50.506
My friends adore your reviews.

09:50.542 --> 09:52.544
That train has just
pulled out, I'm afraid.

09:52.583 --> 09:54.551
Really?

09:54.583 --> 09:57.883
Sooth. You see before you
a recently fired man.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.128
That is simply the best news.

10:02.167 --> 10:03.339
Is it?

10:03.375 --> 10:05.548
Will you come home with me?

10:07.708 --> 10:09.631
With pleasure.

10:12.750 --> 10:16.709
'Jane's home lived up
to my ripest expectations.

Like isn't the word.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.173
Some of the pieces
are really special.

mentioned she had a job for me.

SO.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.135
Why are we here?

11:11.625 --> 11:13.969
I have a proposition.

11:15.083 --> 11:17.085
That's practically incest.

11:21.833 --> 11:25.007
My doctor tells me I have
three months to live.

11:28.208 --> 11:30.336
Leukemia.

11:30.375 --> 11:32.878
Oh.

11:32.917 --> 11:34.885
That's a smeller.

11:36.833 --> 11:38.756
Scared?

11:40.083 --> 11:41.881
Not anymore.

11:41.917 --> 11:45.251
That's ballsy.

11:45.292 --> 11:47.795
But it's a grotty age
and a grotty world

11:47.833 --> 11:49.961
and we'll all be joining you
soon enough.

11:51.375 --> 11:54.754
Do you believe in miracles?

11:55.000 --> 11:58.800
As in calming the storms
and feeding the multitudes?

11:59.042 --> 12:02.717
Give us a fag.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.879
A marvelous and mysterious
thing has happened to me,

12:06.125 --> 12:08.469
and I want you
to investigate it.

12:08.500 --> 12:09.877
I don't know
what you have in mind,

12:09.917 --> 12:12.511
but I'm not exactly
an investigative journalist.

12:12.542 --> 12:15.876
You sure? No interest?

12:15.917 --> 12:19.876
Well, it might be
ungodfatherly of me to suggest,

12:20.125 --> 12:22.459
but it's a racing certainty
you're not in your right mind.

12:22.483 --> 12:25.462
Well, you're forgiven.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.878
But it's a pity, because
you know the people involved.

12:27.917 --> 12:29.885
My Uncle Michael.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.134
Michael Logan?

12:31.167 --> 12:34.717
And I'd pay you handsomely.

12:34.750 --> 12:38.505
25,000 now and the rest
either later or left in my will.

12:38.542 --> 12:40.795
L... l thought you said...

12:40.833 --> 12:44.792
The doctors say I'm going to
die. I don't believe I will.

12:44.833 --> 12:49.213
Something happened to me
at Swafford Hall.

12:49.250 --> 12:52.174
I want you to go there
and find the truth.

12:52.208 --> 12:55.337
And if the truth is
you're not cured?

12:55.375 --> 12:57.469
Then I'm dying of leukemia.

13:01.125 --> 13:02.877
$25,000?

13:03.125 --> 13:05.753
A hundred, all told.

13:05.792 --> 13:07.840
Jane, there must be
1,000 journalists

13:08.083 --> 13:10.427
who would do it
for a tenth of that sum.

13:10.458 --> 13:11.829
But you're the only one
who'd get

13:11.867 --> 13:13.038

13:13.083 --> 13:15.009
- But MichaeL...
- You're godfather to his son.

13:15.033 --> 13:16.106
Use him as your cover.

13:16.242 --> 13:18.315
Delicious girl, since your
mother and I parted ways,

13:18.400 --> 13:19.984
I've been as welcome
at Swafford as a...

13:20.008 --> 13:21.957
A godson is still a godson.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.798
Write to David.
Wangle an invitation.

13:26.708 --> 13:27.880
And stay in touch.

13:28.125 --> 13:30.503
I could be out of the house

13:30.542 --> 13:33.136
'and filling in a deposit slip

the stem of her wine glass.

She said the sperm whale.

has been committed.

28:21.417 --> 28:22.885
'I'm beginning to see why

28:23.125 --> 28:25.298
'he spent so much time
playing the fiddle

28:25.333 --> 28:29.213
'and getting smashed
out of his head on cocaine.'

28:29.250 --> 28:30.877
on the guest list.

28:31.125 --> 28:34.709
Wants to check
if we have a defibrillator.

28:34.750 --> 28:36.548
There's quite a few
dietary requirements.

28:36.583 --> 28:39.177
Oh.

28:39.208 --> 28:41.836
Oh, may I help, Mr. Wallace?

28:42.083 --> 28:43.835
Ah.

28:44.083 --> 28:47.292
Yes. Pod more.

28:47.333 --> 28:50.303
Could someone fix
the curtain rail in my room?

28:50.333 --> 28:52.427
It seems to have
come down in the night.

28:52.458 --> 28:54.506
Of course, sir.

28:54.542 --> 28:56.795
Much obliged. Oh, what's this?
The weekend guest list?

28:56.833 --> 28:59.177
This should be interesting.

28:59.208 --> 29:02.257
May I?

29:02.292 --> 29:03.885
Oliver Mills.

29:04.125 --> 29:07.379
He's probably claiming
a trendy intolerance.

29:07.417 --> 29:11.752
Angina?

29:11.792 --> 29:14.511
'With its promise
of aristocratic splendor,

29:14.542 --> 29:17.591
'and a degree of luxury
that approaches debauchery.

29:17.625 --> 29:20.299
'Swafford attracts
a motley caravan

29:20.333 --> 29:22.711
'of tight-assed bourgeois
and nervous bohemians,

29:23.000 --> 29:24.593
'who roll up the driveway,

29:24.625 --> 29:27.549
'misusing the word
"weekend" as a verb,

'and wondering how soon
they might send an underling

'down into Swafford's
world-class wine cellar.'

29:35.792 --> 29:39.171
Madame Valerie Richmonde
and Mademoiselle Clara.

29:41.417 --> 29:43.886
'Well, who is this
charmingly high-breasted

29:44.125 --> 29:46.344
'and fiercely fuckable creature

29:46.375 --> 29:48.218
'with an air of contemptuous
indifference?'

29:48.250 --> 29:50.252
- Come along.
- 'Bonjour, Madame.'

29:50.292 --> 29:53.171
Merci. My bags.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.881
Ted Wallace.

29:55.125 --> 29:56.877
Oh, I thought
you were a servant.

29:57.125 --> 29:59.469
No. A poet.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.594
Oh.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.468
And Michael's oldest friend.

30:04.792 --> 30:06.419
Of course.

30:08.458 --> 30:12.838
Also David's godfather.

30:13.083 --> 30:16.132
I'm responsible for
his spiritual development.

30:16.167 --> 30:18.295
You are?

30:18.333 --> 30:20.882
This is my daughter Clara.

30:21.125 --> 30:24.379
Maybe you and her
can be friends.

30:24.417 --> 30:26.761
Ah. And you must,
of course, be David.

30:26.792 --> 30:30.422
Jane has told me
everything about you.

30:30.458 --> 30:34.338
I have been looking forward
to meeting you.

30:34.375 --> 30:37.754
'From the presumably fragrant
loin of Madame Valerie

30:37.792 --> 30:40.591
'had sprung a daughter

30:40.625 --> 30:42.719
'I had no sure knowledge
of her paternal lineage,

'but I would hazard a guess

30:44.708 --> 30:47.427
'that this snaggletoothed
myopic hobbit

'may have been conceived
on a visit to middle earth.

30:50.875 --> 30:52.718
'Nature can be unbearably cruel.

30:58.458 --> 31:00.256
'Regrettably,
I was about to be thrust

31:00.292 --> 31:01.338
into my worst nightmare.'

31:02.458 --> 31:04.131
'Having to spend
an entire weekend

'with one of my oldest friends,

'the celebrated theater director

Oliver Mills.'

31:11.833 --> 31:13.460
- I seldom find that...
- Oh!

31:13.500 --> 31:16.709
- Violence is the answer.
- Jesus! Jesus, Oliver!

31:17.000 --> 31:18.518
Did Michael not attach
a security memo

31:18.542 --> 31:19.613
to your invitation?

31:19.650 --> 31:21.044
No. In fact, I'm probably on it.

31:21.083 --> 31:23.131
Would you?

31:23.167 --> 31:26.341
Oh, poor, pompous Hippopotamus.

31:26.375 --> 31:29.504
Ha-ha! Ha.

31:29.542 --> 31:31.834
Has His Lordship not made you
the most welcome of guests?

31:31.858 --> 31:35.993
Actually, I'm here to see David.

31:36.042 --> 31:38.761
Oh. You know? Oh, dear,
what is it? What ills you?

31:39.000 --> 31:40.051
You can tell me.

31:40.200 --> 31:44.910
Ills? He's my godson.
What do you mean?

31:45.000 --> 31:47.298
Ah. Oh, is that
the clitter-clatter

31:47.333 --> 31:50.883
of cutlery on china?
Let's not be late for lunch.

31:50.917 --> 31:54.126
'Hopefully, it was the sound
of the plot thickening.

31:54.167 --> 31:56.215
'I was going to have to start
making some meaningful

31:56.250 --> 31:58.594
'progress or risk spending
the entire summer

31:58.625 --> 32:02.505
'in the company
of these "camarades".'

32:02.542 --> 32:04.715
Ahem! I hear you've had
a particularly successful

32:05.000 --> 32:06.752
year with the stud?

32:07.000 --> 32:09.799
Well, yes, finally, we had
some good results at Hickstead.

32:09.833 --> 32:11.551
- Ah.
- Thanks to him.

32:11.583 --> 32:13.506
I'm particularly proud
of... of our woodlands.

32:13.542 --> 32:16.295
All native species.

32:16.333 --> 32:18.743
Well, it's the kind of green
that only the British can bear.

32:18.767 --> 32:20.260
Oh, if you don't like
the countryside,

32:20.292 --> 32:23.171
what brings you to Swafford?

32:23.208 --> 32:25.711
I am purchasing Li-lac
for my daughter.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.718
- Li-lac?
- Lilac, our gray mare.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.844
I've been taking riding lessons.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.835
Yes, and we can go down
and see her

32:32.875 --> 32:34.593
- in the stables after lunch.
- Yes.

32:34.625 --> 32:36.209
You could help me muck out,
if you like.

32:36.233 --> 32:38.507
Oh, I would like that very much.

32:38.542 --> 32:40.715
Cool.

32:40.750 --> 32:44.584
A hunchback who now also
shovels shit. Quelle fortune!

32:44.625 --> 32:47.834
- Don't slouch.
- Je m'excuse, Mére.

32:47.875 --> 32:50.173
I'm dying for some of that.

32:50.208 --> 32:52.802
Ha-ha, not just figuratively.

32:53.042 --> 32:55.170
You know?

32:55.208 --> 32:56.710
Pod more see-eth,
Pod more heareth,

32:56.750 --> 32:59.378
Podmore telleth Ted Wallace.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.377
Ah.

33:02.417 --> 33:04.590
Is that why you're here?

33:04.625 --> 33:07.799
Ha-ha-ha-ha! No, no.

33:07.833 --> 33:09.756
No, I've got
a delicious new play

33:10.000 --> 33:12.628
which Michael is going to fund.

33:12.667 --> 33:14.135
Am I?

33:18.208 --> 33:20.302
Has anyone seen David?

33:29.583 --> 33:31.756
'Child of trees and son of earth

33:32.000 --> 33:35.425
'lies in wait for his rebirth

33:35.458 --> 33:38.177
'beneath the trees
he hides alone

33:38.208 --> 33:41.712
'beneath your feet
this boy unknown

33:42.000 --> 33:44.879
'lies in his cradle
hidden from sight

33:44.917 --> 33:46.885
'buried like seed

33:47.125 --> 33:49.298
'his seed so white

33:49.333 --> 33:52.132
'he gives himself
the kiss of peace

33:52.167 --> 33:55.626
'his seed doth sprout
with sweet release.'

33:55.667 --> 33:56.759
Well.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.128
'Fuck me.'

34:00.208 --> 34:01.300
Gosh.

34:01.333 --> 34:03.381
L... I'd like you to keep it.

34:05.083 --> 34:07.006
Lovely.

34:09.083 --> 34:10.880
Has Mummy spoken to you
about me?

34:10.917 --> 34:12.793
Why do you ask that?

34:12.833 --> 34:15.882
I worry her.
I can see it in her eyes.

34:16.125 --> 34:19.755
Mothers worry.
It's in their job description.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.378
Well, I worry her
more than Simon.

34:22.417 --> 34:25.545
Simon doesn't treat strangers
to nuggets of penile data.

34:25.583 --> 34:27.380
- He's safe.
- Meaning I'm unsafe?

34:27.417 --> 34:30.170
I should bloody well hope so.

34:30.208 --> 34:32.451
I'm not having a godson of mine
running around the place,

34:32.475 --> 34:35.319
being anything other
than wild and dangerous.

34:37.750 --> 34:40.299
Why are people embarrassed
about sexual things?

34:40.333 --> 34:41.880
<i>I'm not.</i>

34:42.125 --> 34:46.505
In my opinion, people are more
embarrassed about love than sex.

34:46.542 --> 34:48.510
What makes you think that?

34:48.542 --> 34:50.260
They never talk about it.

34:50.292 --> 34:52.340
It's all anyone
ever talks about.

34:52.375 --> 34:53.818
Love, love, love.
Love is all you need.

34:53.842 --> 34:55.795
Love makes the world go round.

34:55.833 --> 34:57.801
9O per cent of the world's
poetry is about love.

34:58.042 --> 35:01.592
With swift, slow;

35:01.625 --> 35:03.719
Sweet, sour;

35:03.750 --> 35:06.344
Adazzle, dim;

35:06.375 --> 35:12.257
He fathers-forth whose beauty
is past change; Praise Him.

35:12.292 --> 35:16.877
Oh, god. Of course.
You like Hopkins.

35:16.917 --> 35:20.876
The greats know that
poetry is how we allow

35:21.125 --> 35:23.344
nature to speak to us.

35:23.375 --> 35:24.877
- Wordsworth?
- No, you chump.

35:24.917 --> 35:26.214
My heart leaps up.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.469
On my couch I lie.

35:28.500 --> 35:29.797
I wandered lonely as a cloud.

35:30.042 --> 35:32.545
He's an egomaniacal onanist.

35:32.583 --> 35:35.177
Wordsworth did not masturbate.

35:35.208 --> 35:37.552
He's a fucking tea-towel writer!

35:41.000 --> 35:43.674
Look, young Pull

35:43.708 --> 35:45.756
my heart rejoices that
you want to be a poet,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.118
but I bet you can't name
a profession with less use,

35:48.142 --> 35:49.669
less chance, less point,

35:49.708 --> 35:51.802
less status and fewer prospects.

35:52.042 --> 35:53.464
Sewage engineer.

35:53.500 --> 35:55.798
Ha! Alright.

35:56.042 --> 35:58.761
Scenario one.

35:58.792 --> 36:01.170
All the poets in England,
Scotland, Wales,

36:01.208 --> 36:02.801
and Northern Ireland
go on strike.

36:02.833 --> 36:05.256
Impact, nil.

36:05.292 --> 36:08.796
Misery, nil. 14 years before
anyone even notices.

36:09.042 --> 36:11.420
Scenario two.

36:11.458 --> 36:13.426
All the sewage engineers
in london alone

36:13.458 --> 36:15.131
go on strike.

36:15.167 --> 36:18.467
Impact, turds and tampons
flopping out of your tap.

36:18.500 --> 36:21.219
Scum and ooze
where e'er you walk.

36:21.250 --> 36:24.459
Misery. Hardship.
Newsworthiness high.

36:27.500 --> 36:32.427
You do still believe in poetry?

36:32.458 --> 36:35.712
Its power to change the world.
You do still care?

36:35.750 --> 36:38.629
Oh, christ. Not you as well.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.761
Look, of course I do.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.843
It... It's just...

36:45.875 --> 36:48.469
Hard work.

36:48.500 --> 36:51.674
You want gold, you break
your back down a mine.

36:51.708 --> 36:54.587
It doesn't just float from
the sky in gleaming bars.

37:01.250 --> 37:03.218
Alright?

37:05.333 --> 37:06.801
Grand.

37:07.042 --> 37:11.377
All this talk of poetry
has awoken my appetite.

37:11.417 --> 37:14.591
Time for a second stanza
of your mother's cream cake.

37:27.792 --> 37:29.669
I'll put the kettle on.

37:30.875 --> 37:32.877
Oh...!

37:34.000 --> 37:35.718
Phwah!

37:37.250 --> 37:38.968
Fuck!

37:40.042 --> 37:41.635
Another bath?

37:41.667 --> 37:43.214
My center of gravity has shifted

37:43.250 --> 37:45.878
since my last time
in a coxless pair.

37:45.917 --> 37:47.176
- You found David, then?
- Yes.

37:47.200 --> 37:48.918
And read some of his poetry.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.627
I've got some of it here,
in fact.

37:50.667 --> 37:53.216
He seems,
in his own graceful way,

37:53.250 --> 37:54.934
to have been recording
a wank in the woods.

37:54.958 --> 37:56.050
Well, any good?

37:56.083 --> 37:57.300
What, the poetry or the wank?

37:57.333 --> 37:58.551
Ted.

37:58.583 --> 38:00.401
- You know if he does it much?
- Oh, please.

38:00.425 --> 38:01.518
Look, my love,

38:01.550 --> 38:03.427
you asked me to keep
an eye on him and I have.

38:03.467 --> 38:05.135
And if wanking's
what he's doing...

38:05.167 --> 38:07.584
Certain things, a mother doesn't
need to know about in full.

38:07.608 --> 38:08.681
I understand,

38:08.717 --> 38:10.986
but I'm not being prurient
just for the pleasure of it.

38:11.125 --> 38:13.127
I've spent most of my life
skipping after women,

38:13.167 --> 38:14.794
like a puppy trying
to please his master.

38:14.833 --> 38:17.427
And the rest, pleasing myself.

38:17.458 --> 38:19.802
And that's fine.
I'm a heartier fellow for it.

38:19.833 --> 38:22.803
But if your son is writing
metaphysical art spunk

38:23.042 --> 38:24.464
and not simply filling
soft fabrics

38:24.500 --> 38:26.423
with human hand cream,

38:26.458 --> 38:28.131
then there is a problem.

38:28.167 --> 38:30.420
Which is?

38:30.458 --> 38:33.337
Mum, I think you should come to
the stables quickly.

38:33.375 --> 38:34.718
Lilac's sick.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.217
Oh, shit.

38:51.542 --> 38:54.625
Well, if the horse is sick,
he must do something.

38:54.667 --> 38:56.590
Yeah, well, I'm...
I'm sure he will.

38:56.625 --> 38:58.418
But first we have to find
the little fellow.

38:58.442 --> 38:59.915
Don't you have faith?

39:00.000 --> 39:03.425
Faith's great, but it'd be nice
to have a soupgon of proof.

39:11.375 --> 39:13.401
This is a rather drastic
course of action,

39:13.425 --> 39:14.497
don't you think?

39:14.542 --> 39:16.340
- She was fine yesterday.
- It's fast-acting.

39:16.375 --> 39:18.753
She'll have
complete renal failure.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.880
There's no ragwort in her field.

39:22.917 --> 39:24.839
Then do you have
another explanation for

39:24.875 --> 39:25.943
the blood in her stool?

39:26.075 --> 39:30.611
No, but it's not an explanation
for the blood in her spittle.

39:30.750 --> 39:32.127
<i>I'm sorry, Clara.</i>

39:32.167 --> 39:34.465
I think we're going to
have to put Lilac down.

39:34.500 --> 39:38.255
But I didn't even
get to ride her.

39:38.292 --> 39:40.044
Come on. Let's go
back to the house.

39:45.625 --> 39:49.129
I'm so sorry, Valerie.
This is just very bad timing.

39:49.167 --> 39:51.368
But there is a chance
that she will recover?

39:51.392 --> 39:54.796
It's a sadness, yes, but Anne
has a lot of experience.

39:54.833 --> 39:59.213
We need time for a miracle.

39:59.250 --> 40:01.252
'Hercule Poirot could
probably take a cursory

40:01.292 --> 40:02.313
glance at this group

40:02.400 --> 40:04.052
'and glean all sorts
of useful ammunition

40:04.092 --> 40:06.762
'for his denouements.

40:06.792 --> 40:08.760
'But if any of this amounts
to any sort of clue,

40:09.000 --> 40:11.753
'it's absolutely wasted on me.'

40:12.000 --> 40:13.627
I think you're being
very premature.

40:15.333 --> 40:17.335
- Oh, mon Dieu!
- David.

40:17.375 --> 40:20.504
Don't touch her. Don't.

40:20.542 --> 40:23.216
A sick horse
can be very dangerous.

40:23.250 --> 40:26.504
- Come on, come away.
- It's not right.

40:26.542 --> 40:29.295
- What happened?
- I'll explain in a moment.

40:29.333 --> 40:31.802
'What was happening was
the Logans discovering

40:31.833 --> 40:34.803
'they had no stomach for
mercy-killing a sickly horse

40:34.833 --> 40:37.803
'and yet were possessed of
a seemingly limitless capacity

40:38.042 --> 40:41.216
'for procrastination
and indecisiveness.'

40:41.250 --> 40:42.718
Maybe you should
come back tomorrow,

40:42.750 --> 40:44.252
and we'll reassess it and see...

40:44.292 --> 40:46.109
- Yes. Yes, my Lady.
- What she's like then.

40:46.133 --> 40:48.837
Thank you.

40:48.875 --> 40:51.879
Right. Perhaps some drinks
before dinner.

40:51.917 --> 40:54.591
Yes, perhaps several.

41:06.458 --> 41:07.909
I got the idea
from the playwright.

41:08.033 --> 41:09.810
Met him in Venice
on my last trip.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.297
Is there a point?

41:11.333 --> 41:13.709
Or are you merely recounting
a selection of random events?

41:13.733 --> 41:14.810
Ch, hush.

41:14.850 --> 41:17.424
Now, where was I? Oh, yes.

41:17.458 --> 41:20.837
Gianni had the most enormous...

41:20.875 --> 41:22.969
Oh, my God.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.344
C-o-c-k.

41:26.375 --> 41:29.709
And he was afraid
he might hurt me.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.798
"Gianni darling", I said.
"Fear not.

41:31.833 --> 41:33.801
"After what I've been through,"

41:34.042 --> 41:36.420
"you'll be lucky
if it touches the sides."

41:36.458 --> 41:38.711
"It'll be like pushing a paper
boat up the Grand Canal."

41:42.125 --> 41:44.218
This is not language
for when children are present.

41:44.242 --> 41:46.761
Oh, prude la-la. They know.

41:46.792 --> 41:48.544
There's two options.

41:48.583 --> 41:50.301
One, we let Oliver
rattle on home

41:50.333 --> 41:51.434
about his various exploits

41:51.475 --> 41:53.253
and the occasional ear
gets singed.

41:53.292 --> 41:54.839
Or, two,

41:55.083 --> 41:57.711
we let the kids work it out
entirely for themselves.

41:57.750 --> 42:01.755
I just don't understand every
person obsession with sex.

42:01.792 --> 42:03.743
It's not an obsession.
It's the meaning of life.

42:03.767 --> 42:06.170
Well, there is something that
children can learn with help,

42:06.208 --> 42:07.801
and that is good manners.

42:08.042 --> 42:09.809
- David, help with the plates.
- Yes, Mummy.

42:09.833 --> 42:11.176
Clara.

42:16.167 --> 42:17.510
Oh, mon Dieu.

42:17.542 --> 42:19.251
Will you tell us
a story, Oliver?

42:19.275 --> 42:21.503
Oh, I thought
you'd never ask, Michael.

42:21.542 --> 42:24.876
Well, the story is about
a down-on-his-luck gigolo

42:25.125 --> 42:28.709
who gets a job playing
alto sax on a cruise ship.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.840
- But what he's really doing...
- Oliver, stop.

42:32.708 --> 42:34.802
- Not a chance.
- Oh.

42:34.833 --> 42:37.131
Not a penny.

42:37.167 --> 42:42.549
Well, if we can't drink to my
play, let's drink to Lilac.

42:45.792 --> 42:49.171
May she have her miracle.

42:49.208 --> 42:51.802
- 'Yes, to Lilac.'
- To Lilac.

42:52.042 --> 42:54.018
'The same toast they'll be
making tomorrow night

42:54.042 --> 42:55.084
at the glue factory,

42:55.117 --> 42:57.591
'as her bones render noxiously
in the background.'

42:57.625 --> 42:58.625
To miracles.

43:03.208 --> 43:04.801
Unlike you to forsake a drink.

43:05.042 --> 43:06.840
You don't seriously
expect me to join you

43:06.875 --> 43:09.469
in a wine-soaked prayer
for a miracle?

43:09.500 --> 43:10.717
Is that so ridiculous?

43:10.750 --> 43:11.797
It's fluff.

43:12.042 --> 43:13.885
Miracles are phenomena

43:14.125 --> 43:15.793
that we're too frightened
or, in my case,

43:15.817 --> 43:17.419
too lazy to understand.

43:17.458 --> 43:21.668
But nothing miraculous
ever actually happens,

43:21.708 --> 43:24.177
and certainly no-one
is ever healed.

43:24.208 --> 43:26.256
You don't believe in healing?

43:26.292 --> 43:29.626
You can correct
a mechanical fault,

43:29.667 --> 43:34.673
but nothing can be truly
cured or made whole.

43:34.708 --> 43:37.791
Everything rots.

43:37.833 --> 43:41.417
And that's the beastly
bloody end of it.

43:41.458 --> 43:45.759
Would anyone like
a comforting chamomile?

43:45.792 --> 43:47.544
I think Tedward and I
might have a chat

43:47.583 --> 43:50.302
over something a bit stronger.

43:50.333 --> 43:53.177
'So, I was sent here
to investigate miracles

43:53.208 --> 43:56.712
'and have now been induced to
refute their very existence.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.752
'More than a coincidence,
I fancy.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.673
'Im beginning to feel
like doubting Thomas

44:00.708 --> 44:04.212
'on a certain easter morning.'

44:04.250 --> 44:06.844
What follows, you will never
discuss with anyone.

44:09.250 --> 44:13.426
My father came to this country
from Massachusetts in 1936.

44:13.458 --> 44:16.132
When the war came, he enlisted

44:16.167 --> 44:19.216
and trained as an engineering
officer in the R.A.F.

44:19.250 --> 44:23.300
Later that year, a young man
came round the base.

44:23.333 --> 44:28.715
His father had a metal splinter
in his foot. It was gangrenous.

44:28.750 --> 44:30.297
The boy knew the doctor
would amputate

44:30.333 --> 44:33.758
and he asked my father for help.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.344
My father touched the foot,
the splinter came out,

44:36.375 --> 44:37.501
and the wound healed.

44:37.542 --> 44:39.135
- Instantly?
- Yes.

44:39.167 --> 44:40.659
Well, I don't want
to spoil the story,

44:40.683 --> 44:42.551
but that could have
happened by chance.

44:42.583 --> 44:44.881
That was just the first time.

44:45.125 --> 44:48.709
A few more miracles,
and people began to talk.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.017
By the end of the war,

44:50.100 --> 44:51.768
he was being hounded.
It was intolerable.

44:51.792 --> 44:52.994
That was another time.

44:53.042 --> 44:55.886
It was 7O years ago, Ted,
not the Middle Ages.

44:57.625 --> 45:01.300
I never had a gift. L... l guess
it skipped a generation.

45:01.333 --> 45:04.132
It's a childhood fairy tale.

45:05.417 --> 45:08.500
Anne has asthma.

45:08.542 --> 45:10.751
Do you remember that hot summer
four or five years ago?

45:12.000 --> 45:13.826
'David and I
were out one afternoon

45:13.850 --> 45:15.423
'and she suffered
a terrible attack.'

45:17.583 --> 45:20.837
Mum?

45:20.875 --> 45:22.468
'Simon was there, doing C.P.R.

45:22.492 --> 45:23.558
like he'd been taught,

45:23.600 --> 45:24.673
'but it wasn't working.'

45:24.708 --> 45:27.302
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

45:27.333 --> 45:29.506
We got back.
David heard the commotion...

45:34.292 --> 45:35.809
rushed in,
pushed his brother aside,

45:35.833 --> 45:37.543
and placed his hands
on his mother's chest,

45:37.567 --> 45:39.194
and she began to breathe.

45:40.417 --> 45:42.886
You're saying
David saved her life?

45:43.125 --> 45:46.629
Healed.
Not another attack since.

45:46.667 --> 45:48.590
'It's like Stephen Hawking

45:48.625 --> 45:51.834
'announcing he still
believes in Santa Claus.

45:52.083 --> 45:55.132
'I don't mind my old friends
turning into venal assholes,

45:55.167 --> 45:57.670
'but it's rather unnerving
when they go crazy.'

45:57.708 --> 45:59.710
Jane came to stay
with us at Easter.

46:01.292 --> 46:03.590
The leukemia had taken hold

46:03.625 --> 46:05.753
and the doctors had given her
three weeks to live.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.594
She wanted to spend them
somewhere peaceful.

46:08.625 --> 46:10.719
She took to her bed
the moment she arrived.

46:10.750 --> 46:13.503
The end of the first week,
she began to look better.

46:13.542 --> 46:15.886
'The second week,
she thought she'd get up.

46:16.125 --> 46:19.174
'The third week, entirely cured.

46:19.208 --> 46:22.257
'David had been with her
every day.'

46:22.292 --> 46:24.841
There just must be
a rational explanation.

46:25.083 --> 46:28.667
David's hands heal.
I've seen it with my own eyes.

46:28.708 --> 46:30.426
But I'm at a loss.

46:30.458 --> 46:32.225
We're private people.
We don't make a fuss.

46:32.258 --> 46:34.758
But this feels big, important.

46:34.792 --> 46:38.467
Do I hide it like a curse
or shout it from the rooftops?

46:38.500 --> 46:41.253
Why, in the name of
dysfunction, are you asking me?

46:41.292 --> 46:45.593
Yesterday, you made a big fuss
about being David's godfather.

46:45.625 --> 46:47.878

53:29.625 --> 53:31.168
'The steam whistle replaced

53:31.192 --> 53:32.443
by the turgid sound of diesel

53:32.483 --> 53:35.283
'and now electric trains.'

53:35.417 --> 53:37.795
- Mr. Wallace?
- I'm looking for David.

53:38.042 --> 53:41.421
Oh, one of the great
undertakings of our age.

53:48.583 --> 53:51.302
- What the hell was that?
- I hear nothing, sir.

53:51.333 --> 53:54.587
Don't tell me the last bastion
of sanity of this house

53:54.625 --> 53:58.300
is abandoning his faculties too?

53:58.333 --> 54:01.837
The greater the discretion,
the larger the tip.

54:09.083 --> 54:12.883
Do you know where David is?
Oh, come on, John.

54:12.917 --> 54:16.217
I know you see everything
that goes on round here.

54:16.250 --> 54:18.048
- He's a bugger for hiding.
- Go on.

54:20.875 --> 54:23.128
Frequently doesn't
sleep in his bed.

54:23.167 --> 54:25.626
Never leaves by the door when
there's the option of a window.

54:25.650 --> 54:30.632
In fact, he must spend most
nights out in the grounds.

54:30.667 --> 54:31.793
But where?

54:32.042 --> 54:33.885
'I licked the grass,

54:33.917 --> 54:35.669
'licked it clean.

54:35.708 --> 54:37.710
'Clean grass is hay,

54:37.750 --> 54:40.299
'gold hay for the flesh.

54:40.333 --> 54:42.381
'I hugged the leaves,

54:42.417 --> 54:44.260
'squeezed their green.

54:44.292 --> 54:45.635
'Squeezed sap is blood

54:45.667 --> 54:48.876
'and blood must be fresh.'

54:49.125 --> 54:52.675
And sowed the seed,
seed of my own.

54:52.708 --> 54:54.005
Oh! Hello, Valerie!

55:01.542 --> 55:03.590
Oh.

55:13.458 --> 55:15.301
Oh.

55:19.167 --> 55:21.841
Come on, Clara.
Just up at the woods.

55:22.083 --> 55:24.051
Oh, god.

55:35.917 --> 55:38.045
Oh. Ooh!

55:48.208 --> 55:50.336
Ow. Ah.

55:50.375 --> 55:51.467
Eurgh.

55:53.375 --> 55:56.094
If you let the spirit
in, it will heal you.

56:00.000 --> 56:03.379
Feel the spirit surging through
you. You must embrace it.

56:03.417 --> 56:05.636
Drain it, yes.

56:05.667 --> 56:08.170
That's right, drain it.

56:08.208 --> 56:09.755
- No! No, let her go!
- Yes. Fuck off!

56:09.792 --> 56:12.420
Aaah! Aaah!

56:12.458 --> 56:15.302
"Eursh!
- Om."

56:15.333 --> 56:17.554
Come on. We can't have
you going into the house,

56:17.600 --> 56:18.651
looking like this.

56:18.700 --> 56:20.543
- Let's get you cleaned up.
- Oh, she bit me.

56:20.567 --> 56:21.611
Simon, you can't leave me!

56:21.642 --> 56:22.915
Physicist, heal thyself.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.799
'So much for the modern miracle.

56:25.833 --> 56:27.756
'I don't recall
Saint Francis of Assisi

56:27.792 --> 56:29.169
'ejaculating into
anybody's mouth.'

56:29.208 --> 56:30.835
Fuck!

56:30.875 --> 56:32.384
'Maybe they just left
that part out.'

56:32.408 --> 56:34.552
Uncle Ted, she... she bit me.

56:34.583 --> 56:37.712
Are all your cures like that?

56:37.750 --> 56:40.549
Don't talk. Don't say a word.

56:40.583 --> 56:42.881
Can you stand?

56:42.917 --> 56:45.420
Yeah, come on.

56:45.458 --> 56:47.226
'It's easier for the old
to judge the young.'

56:47.250 --> 56:48.423
She bit me.

56:48.458 --> 56:50.201
'And I'll admit it's been
particularly hard

56:50.225 --> 56:51.943
'to warm to David,

56:52.083 --> 56:54.711
'with his cricket sweaters
and soggy sonnets,

56:55.000 --> 56:57.719
'but the truth is that
this boy is my godson.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.753
I may be unreliable when it
comes to fonts

57:01.000 --> 57:02.593
and silver napkin rings,

57:02.625 --> 57:06.255
'but when I saw him suffering
a catastrophic sex disaster,

57:06.292 --> 57:09.216
'I did feel a twinge
of the old esprit de corps.

57:09.250 --> 57:11.548
I never was a boy scout,

57:11.583 --> 57:13.836
'and I certainly don't do
a good deed every day,

57:14.083 --> 57:16.882
'but one whopper every 15 years

57:17.125 --> 57:19.719
'surely must earn me
a badge of some kind.'

57:19.750 --> 57:22.469
Mr. Lennox?

57:22.500 --> 57:25.504
Mr. Lennox?

57:28.458 --> 57:30.756
Oh. Yes.

57:30.792 --> 57:32.715
Yes.

57:32.750 --> 57:35.594
Can you tell me the nature

57:35.625 --> 57:37.798
of your... relationship
with David?

57:40.833 --> 57:42.961
Some days good, some days bad.

57:44.333 --> 57:46.631
You are the boy's father?

57:46.667 --> 57:48.761
For my sins.

57:49.000 --> 57:52.300
Then perhaps you can explain
why David said to me,

57:52.333 --> 57:53.773
"The pain got much worse
in the car,"

57:54.000 --> 57:56.594
"partly because."

57:56.625 --> 58:01.552
"Uncle Ted is
a terrible driver."

58:01.583 --> 58:05.167
I'm glad to say it's rare
for a child to be admitted

58:05.208 --> 58:07.882
with human bite marks
to the penis.

58:07.917 --> 58:10.887
Even rarer for the
hysterical boy to be accompanied

58:11.125 --> 58:14.049
by a famous public figure.

58:18.875 --> 58:22.334
Well, if you knew who I was,
why didn't you say?

58:22.375 --> 58:24.534
I think you'd better tell me
who David's parents are.

58:24.558 --> 58:26.802
I'd like t0 talk to David.

58:26.833 --> 58:29.586
I don't think the police will
allow you to do any such thing.

58:29.625 --> 58:31.377
Police?

58:31.417 --> 58:33.343
You're in a position
of authority, Mr. Wallace.

58:33.367 --> 58:34.794
Let's be grown-ups, shall we?

58:34.833 --> 58:37.427
This is just a pair of lovers

58:37.458 --> 58:40.462
suffering an unfortunate mishap.

58:40.500 --> 58:43.424
This may pass for acceptable
in your bohemian world, but...

58:43.458 --> 58:46.132
I have a boy David's age.

58:46.167 --> 58:48.501
If this happened to him, do you
think I'd kick up a stink?

58:48.525 --> 58:50.999
It may interest you to know
that I'm a magistrate.

58:51.042 --> 58:52.882
And a member of Calvinists
against cock-sucking

58:53.083 --> 58:55.461
and housewives against
fellatio, no doubt?

58:55.500 --> 58:58.299
The parents get involved,
the... The guilt, the shame...

58:58.333 --> 59:00.677
If I do not have the number
of David's parents this minute,

59:00.708 --> 59:02.301
I shall call the police.

59:04.125 --> 59:05.843
One, two...

59:06.083 --> 59:07.881
All right, all right.

59:08.125 --> 59:10.674
I suppose you want the girl's
name too so two sets can be...

59:10.708 --> 59:12.802
- Girl?
- The girl.

59:13.042 --> 59:15.340
The girL. The girl.

59:15.375 --> 59:17.375
Did you think he was being
sucked off by a giraffe?

59:21.125 --> 59:23.469
I thought you were the...

59:24.542 --> 59:25.668
other party.

59:25.708 --> 59:28.131
You thought what?

59:33.375 --> 59:35.719
If there's been a mistake,
I'm sorry.

59:35.750 --> 59:38.594
It's my duty to...

59:40.000 --> 59:41.673
establish the facts.

59:41.708 --> 59:44.257
'Oh, fabulous.

59:44.292 --> 59:46.886
'I have chanced upon one of the
very few people in the world

59:46.917 --> 59:49.420
'to have my poetry
on their shelf,

59:49.458 --> 59:52.257
'who have examined
the contents of my soul,

59:52.292 --> 59:55.216
'and she thinks
I'm a fucking pedophile.'

59:55.250 --> 59:56.877
Well, I went down
to the woods today,

59:57.125 --> 59:59.344
and I sure as hell
had a big surprise.

59:59.375 --> 01:00:02.629
I missed the sex offenders
register by a whisker.

01:00:02.667 --> 01:00:05.716
Sometimes the gift
demands a sacrifice.

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:07.297
Perhaps it would help
if you told me

01:00:07.333 --> 01:00:09.711
about the exact nature
of your powers.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.253
Stop the car.

01:00:12.292 --> 01:00:14.351
No, I've done quite enough
running around after you

01:00:14.375 --> 01:00:15.442
for one weekend.

01:00:15.475 --> 01:00:18.069
I'll tell you, but not here.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.755
I call it the gift, not my gift.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.174
I can feel the power of nature.

01:00:32.875 --> 01:00:36.505
I put my hand
on a sick creature,

01:00:36.542 --> 01:00:38.761
and it courses through me
like lightning.

01:00:42.458 --> 01:00:45.667
But I also have human feelings.

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:47.881
<i>Hunger.</i>

01:00:48.125 --> 01:00:50.719
And cold.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.378
And all types of hunger.

01:00:57.833 --> 01:01:01.042
The first time I had
a wet dream was last year.

01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:04.377
I know, which is late.

01:01:07.458 --> 01:01:09.552
I knew that... that
I couldn't allow

01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:13.463
such a terrible thing
to happen, all that waste.

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:20.210
It's not just my hands, you see.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:23.377
Every part of me can heal.

01:01:24.792 --> 01:01:27.716
My blood and my seed.

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:29.548
Okay.

01:01:29.583 --> 01:01:32.712
I knew that if I only
used it for good,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.344
and not to give myself pleasure,

01:01:35.375 --> 01:01:37.377
then that could be
a powerful tool as well.

01:01:37.417 --> 01:01:39.385
Which is why with Clara, you...

01:01:39.417 --> 01:01:42.216
It started with Jane.

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:45.800
Her sickness was
too powerful for my hand,

01:01:45.833 --> 01:01:48.837
but I knew that

01:01:49.083 --> 01:01:52.292
if I got my essence in,
deep inside her,

01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:54.210
then it would work.

01:01:55.375 --> 01:01:57.252
These powers.

01:01:57.292 --> 01:02:00.592
Do you think they're inherited?

01:02:00.625 --> 01:02:01.877
Anyone can have a pure spirit.

01:02:02.125 --> 01:02:03.468
Even me?

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:06.219
Especially you.

01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:08.548
When you were a poet,

01:02:08.583 --> 01:02:11.211
you were inspired to see
the glory of the world.

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:13.503
Bollocks.

01:02:13.542 --> 01:02:15.715
You want poetry, you fight
with paper and pencil.

01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:18.128
You muck in with humanity.

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:21.137
You don't wait for inspiration
to vomit bliss over you.

01:02:21.167 --> 01:02:24.717
The world is charged
with the grandeur of God.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.879
It will flame out,
like shining from shook foil...

01:02:28.125 --> 01:02:30.423
Gerard Manley Hopkins worked.

01:02:30.458 --> 01:02:32.711
He studied anglo-saxon
rhythmic structure.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.878
He learned Welsh.

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:37.887
But the genius was inside him.

01:02:37.917 --> 01:02:39.794
Look at Simon.

01:02:39.833 --> 01:02:43.713
We have the same genes,
but he has an ordinary soul.

01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:44.876
And your soul?

01:02:45.125 --> 01:02:47.878
It's different and special.

01:02:48.125 --> 01:02:50.719
Different and special.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.378
Yes, and you should
respect that.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.502
Bollocks!

01:03:04.542 --> 01:03:07.261
'See what needs to be seen,
my ass.

01:03:07.292 --> 01:03:10.296
'Miracles, my cock
and baggy balls.

01:03:10.333 --> 01:03:12.335
'Sorry to piss on the parade,

'be it the shabby chic of Zen

'or the wanton razzamatazz

'or merely sucking off

'Maybe I should sacrifice

'I wasn't always this bitter

'Make me whole, God's son.'

Pour me a gin, would you?

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.627
Yes, of course.

01:04:19.667 --> 01:04:23.217
My God,
look at the state of you.

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:27.710
If you're here, Rebecca,
who's ruling over Narnia?

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:31.380
Fancy you having the gall
to turn up here!

01:04:31.417 --> 01:04:33.715
I bet Michael must have
loved it, when you rang.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.877
I wrote to David, as it happens.

01:04:36.125 --> 01:04:39.299
Oh, course you did.

01:04:39.333 --> 01:04:42.132
Got some godfathering
to make up on.

01:04:44.833 --> 01:04:47.256
'It appears we can evade
the truth no longer

01:04:47.292 --> 01:04:50.262

'with whom I dared to dally

01:05:00.542 --> 01:05:02.459
I'm joined this evening
by one of this country's

01:05:02.483 --> 01:05:03.483
most celebrated poets,

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:04.998
and now in the running...

01:05:05.042 --> 01:05:07.886
'our little folie a deux
came crashing to a conclusion

01:05:08.125 --> 01:05:09.877
'after she invited me
to perform some

01:05:10.125 --> 01:05:11.251
earnest chin-stroking

01:05:11.292 --> 01:05:15.422
'on her tedious late-night
poetry stroke-fest, "Stanza".'

01:05:15.458 --> 01:05:18.177
Let us return to the reaction
to comments that you made...

01:05:18.208 --> 01:05:20.034
- Women hate me...
- In a newspaper interview.

01:05:20.058 --> 01:05:21.836
Because I'm brave enough
to say what we both

01:05:21.875 --> 01:05:22.942
know to be true,

01:05:22.975 --> 01:05:24.852
that women don't enjoy sex.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.334
Oh, maybe the women that
you've had experience with, Ted.

01:05:27.358 --> 01:05:29.302
They put up with it
as the price they have to pay

01:05:29.333 --> 01:05:32.883
for having a man,
for having a relationship.

01:05:32.917 --> 01:05:35.261
I mean, if we're being
absolutely frank,

01:05:35.292 --> 01:05:36.760
the only reason
I come on this show

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.800
is because I get to fuck you
from time to time

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.503
and indulging
those kind of absurd whims

01:05:41.542 --> 01:05:45.342
is the highest compliment
our sex can pay yours.

01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:47.173
Thank you, Mr. Wallace.

01:05:47.208 --> 01:05:49.256
Is... Is that it?

01:05:49.292 --> 01:05:50.839
'This was just me
spitting on my hands

01:05:50.875 --> 01:05:52.877
'and getting down to worK.'

01:05:53.125 --> 01:05:55.423
'for the next five years,

01:05:55.458 --> 01:05:57.301
'I made a pile of all
my treasures and talents,

01:05:57.325 --> 01:05:59.127
'clambered up on top

01:05:59.167 --> 01:06:00.384
'and cheerfully self-immolated

01:06:00.417 --> 01:06:03.546
'like a Laotian monk.

01:06:03.583 --> 01:06:04.926
'Since then, Rebecca
has performed

01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:07.674
diligently as my nemesis.

01:06:07.708 --> 01:06:10.678
'We are the jangling skeletons
in each other's closets.'

01:06:10.708 --> 01:06:13.382
Jane told me
you'd come down here,

01:06:13.417 --> 01:06:15.761
but I didn't actually believe
that you would have the...

01:06:15.792 --> 01:06:18.295
She asked me to investigate
her recovery.

01:06:18.333 --> 01:06:19.659
She has proved
the doctors wrong,

01:06:19.683 --> 01:06:21.551
and that's good enough for me.

01:06:21.583 --> 01:06:23.506
You're not interested
in the how and the why?

01:06:23.542 --> 01:06:26.796
Ignoring your goddaughter
during her youth is one thing,

01:06:27.042 --> 01:06:29.215
but taking advantage
of her is repugnant.

01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:31.298
I am not exploiting
your daughter.

01:06:31.333 --> 01:06:33.882
Oh, of course not.
You're just taking her money.

01:06:33.917 --> 01:06:35.794
Of which she's got loads.

01:06:35.833 --> 01:06:38.677
But what she needs is

01:06:38.708 --> 01:06:41.461
someone willing to get to
the bottom of this cure.

01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:46.548
And you're the man for that job?

01:06:46.583 --> 01:06:48.802
Yes.

01:06:48.833 --> 01:06:50.585
And how's it going,
this noble quest?

01:06:53.417 --> 01:06:55.795
Come on, Ted Wallace.

01:06:56.042 --> 01:06:57.501
The only thing you've
ever got to the

01:06:57.525 --> 01:06:59.493
bottom of is a whiskey bottle.

01:07:35.917 --> 01:07:36.917
Are you haPPY?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.172
'Yes.

01:07:38.208 --> 01:07:40.586
'Yes! Thank you.

01:07:40.625 --> 01:07:42.753
'Isn't it wonderful?'

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.877
It's an impenetrable
load of bollocks

01:07:45.125 --> 01:07:50.382
and I've got no way into it
or through it or anything else.

01:07:50.417 --> 01:07:53.341
Keep your money, Jane.
I have done bugger all.

01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:57.673
Be haPPY-

01:07:58.833 --> 01:08:01.507
I can't discredit David's gift.

01:08:01.542 --> 01:08:03.840
'Your cure is yours to have.'

01:08:04.083 --> 01:08:06.461
Ted, you can have it too.

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.798
'Just open your heart.'

01:08:08.833 --> 01:08:10.426
What if I don't want to?

01:08:10.458 --> 01:08:11.880
You must.

01:08:12.125 --> 01:08:13.877
'No, I mustn't.

01:08:14.125 --> 01:08:17.334
'I don't have to do anything,

01:08:17.375 --> 01:08:18.868
'or desperately cling
to any of your

01:08:18.892 --> 01:08:20.760
ridiculous superstitions,

01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:24.671
'because I'm not about
to kick the bucket.'

01:08:24.707 --> 01:08:27.426
Aah! Bugger!

01:08:27.457 --> 01:08:30.176
'I'm not about
to kick the bucket.

01:08:30.207 --> 01:08:33.006
'Kick the bucket.'

01:08:42.042 --> 01:08:44.295
Oh, Christ.

01:08:51.457 --> 01:08:55.008
It's, "physician, heal thyself."

01:08:56.292 --> 01:08:58.545
I need the vet's number.

01:08:58.582 --> 01:09:01.756
Um... zero, double one,

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.752
four, nine, six,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.379
zero, treble nine.

01:09:07.417 --> 01:09:10.876
Is, um... is David
very angry with me?

01:09:15.582 --> 01:09:19.633
He'll be fine. You've done
more for him than you realize.

01:09:19.667 --> 01:09:21.294
'Mr. Ogden?'

01:09:21.332 --> 01:09:24.633
about the horse this morning,
Lilac Logan.

01:09:26.167 --> 01:09:28.169
Yeah, I know
that's not her real name.

01:09:34.417 --> 01:09:36.511
Late for dinner, Ted?

01:09:36.542 --> 01:09:38.215
Er... I'll be dressed
in a minute.

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:42.841
Go through without me.

01:09:42.875 --> 01:09:46.550
L... I've just seen David.
What is wrong with him?

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:48.756
Bit knocked about,
but he'll be fine.

01:09:48.792 --> 01:09:51.591
- Oh.
- Annie?

01:09:53.167 --> 01:09:55.511
Do you think
he's a miracle worker?

01:09:57.167 --> 01:09:58.760
Well, I, um...

01:09:58.792 --> 01:10:02.717
You're his mother. If he is,
you must sense something.

01:10:05.125 --> 01:10:07.753
L... l think he's a magical boy.

01:10:07.792 --> 01:10:10.420
But sometimes...

01:10:12.583 --> 01:10:13.880
I still wheeze.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:20.425
I've always known
you are a wonder.

01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:32.253
I think it's time for us
to go public.

01:10:32.292 --> 01:10:34.545
That's for me and Anne
to decide.

01:10:34.583 --> 01:10:36.711
Oh, for God's sake!
It's not a guilty secret.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.549
It's a wonderful,
wonderful miracle

01:10:39.583 --> 01:10:42.211
that makes everyone happy!

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:43.843
I'm sorry to piss
on your chips, Oliver,

01:10:44.083 --> 01:10:46.836
but I'm not happy.

01:10:47.083 --> 01:10:49.677
Of course not. Sweet Jesus,
you're a piece of work.

01:10:53.083 --> 01:10:54.083
Sorry, Michael.

01:10:56.458 --> 01:10:57.425
- What's going on?
- Michael.

01:10:57.458 --> 01:10:59.711
I've listened to the stories,

01:10:59.750 --> 01:11:03.550
but I don't believe
in David's powers.

01:11:03.583 --> 01:11:06.883
One chance to raise his eyes
to heaven and what does he say?

01:11:07.125 --> 01:11:09.469
It's a bit odd, isn't it,

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.176
that a poet, of all people,
should be the

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.673
only one not convinced?

01:11:12.708 --> 01:11:14.881
Not at all.

01:11:14.917 --> 01:11:17.591
I'm a poet because
I'm very mundane.

01:11:17.625 --> 01:11:20.253
I'm only good with
what I can taste and see

01:11:20.292 --> 01:11:23.262
and hear and smell and touch.

01:11:23.292 --> 01:11:25.143
Oh, so you come to sneer at us
up your snotty sleeve?

01:11:25.167 --> 01:11:28.296
Jane asked me.

01:11:28.333 --> 01:11:30.836
She told me there were
miracles at Swafford

01:11:30.875 --> 01:11:33.128
which she wanted me
to investigate.

01:11:33.167 --> 01:11:35.215
And?

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:38.800
And I think David is
proud and sensitive.

01:11:39.042 --> 01:11:40.794
Oh.

01:11:41.042 --> 01:11:43.670
Is that it?

01:11:43.708 --> 01:11:45.381
Oliver, be quiet.

01:11:47.667 --> 01:11:50.876
L... l would like to hear
what Ted has to say.

01:11:55.375 --> 01:11:58.675
No teenager is as clever
as they'd like to be.

01:12:00.667 --> 01:12:04.126
David is at the point
where he has glimpsed ideas,

01:12:04.167 --> 01:12:07.501
but their true meaning
lies beyond his reach.

01:12:12.042 --> 01:12:19.335
Our culture rewards
different and special.

01:12:19.375 --> 01:12:21.719
The stories we tell our
children are of superheroes

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.334
and foundlings
with undiscovered talents

01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:28.549
that soar to towering heights.

01:12:28.583 --> 01:12:31.837
Michael told his son a story

01:12:31.875 --> 01:12:33.718
that any child would like
to be the center of,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.799
and David decided it was true.

01:12:37.042 --> 01:12:40.421
It's no story.
I know what I've seen and felt.

01:12:40.458 --> 01:12:44.383
You've seen and fed the
delusions of an ordinary child.

01:12:44.417 --> 01:12:46.795
- Ted, what...
- Darling.

01:12:47.042 --> 01:12:48.589
My father's gift.
I've seen it work.

01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:51.834
Alright. Yes.

01:12:51.875 --> 01:12:55.459
Your father did have a gift
and it was passed on.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:55.716
Oh, he's off his head!
He doesn't know what

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
he's talking about!

01:12:57.125 --> 01:13:00.004
Oliver, you will
not interrupt again!

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.503
I'm sorry, Ted. Please continue.

01:13:07.458 --> 01:13:11.292
Michael's father's gift
was passed on

01:13:11.333 --> 01:13:13.256
- to Simon.
- Simon?

01:13:14.333 --> 01:13:16.176
A few summers ago,

01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:20.509
Anne suffered
a terrible asthma attack.

01:13:20.542 --> 01:13:22.169
- 'Simon kept his head...
- Mum? Mum.

01:13:22.208 --> 01:13:24.381
And tried to get her breathing.'

01:13:24.417 --> 01:13:30.299
'David broke past and put
his hands on Anne's chest

01:13:30.333 --> 01:13:31.893
'just as Simon's first aid
started to work.

01:13:31.917 --> 01:13:32.917
Oh, thank you, darling.

01:13:33.083 --> 01:13:35.302
Michael.

01:13:35.333 --> 01:13:38.257
You saw your wife recover and
you thought of your father,

01:13:38.292 --> 01:13:41.546
and then you told David
that he had inherited a gift.

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:43.631
He told Jane

01:13:43.667 --> 01:13:46.716
and when she, too, got better,

01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:49.549
he let the bush telegraph
do the rest.

01:13:49.583 --> 01:13:54.840
So, you're claiming that
Simon has been healing people?

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:59.800
Your father didn't
have healing powers.

01:13:59.833 --> 01:14:01.881
He had kindness,
courage and sense,

01:14:01.917 --> 01:14:06.252
and that is what
Simon has inherited.

01:14:06.292 --> 01:14:09.171
David envisaged something
far more grandiose.

01:14:09.208 --> 01:14:12.758
He told himself that
as long as he stayed pure,

01:14:12.792 --> 01:14:15.875
his semen would be
a channel for healing.

01:14:16.125 --> 01:14:20.835
And a far more powerful one
than his hands could ever be.

01:14:21.083 --> 01:14:25.714
Jane, beautiful, wonderful,
desperate Jane,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.379
presented him
with the ideal test case.

01:14:29.417 --> 01:14:31.385
'I'm afraid it's probable

01:14:31.417 --> 01:14:33.340
'he tried the same trick
on Lilac.'

01:14:36.625 --> 01:14:39.253
Oh, my God.

01:14:46.083 --> 01:14:47.768
Only Oliver can say
what technique was used.

01:14:47.792 --> 01:14:48.759
How dare you?

01:14:48.792 --> 01:14:51.136
You seduced my son?

01:14:51.167 --> 01:14:53.795
It was a cure.

01:14:54.042 --> 01:14:56.465
He cured me.

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.594
- Go and get David.
- Yes, Mum.

01:14:58.625 --> 01:15:02.209
But people are better,
and none of this explains Lilac.

01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:04.298
Lilac was my fault.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:07.758
On my first morning here,

01:15:07.792 --> 01:15:12.969
I dropped a bottle of whiskey
into this bucket.

01:15:17.708 --> 01:15:21.633
And Lilac must have
lapped and lapped.

01:15:21.667 --> 01:15:26.298
She was drunk
and then she was hung over.

01:15:26.333 --> 01:15:27.801
<i>Je was vomk.</i>

01:15:27.833 --> 01:15:30.052
God knows what you
thought you were doing.

01:15:32.708 --> 01:15:35.131
And what do you say to this?

01:15:45.667 --> 01:15:48.341
Did you really throw away
all your pills?

01:15:48.375 --> 01:15:50.298
I don't need them.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.129
I've never felt better.

01:15:55.167 --> 01:15:58.626
Then why were you shouting
in agony in your bedroom?

01:16:04.583 --> 01:16:08.133
I don't know what's the matter
with you all.

01:16:08.167 --> 01:16:10.545
Jane.

01:16:10.583 --> 01:16:13.462
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.377
Yes.

01:16:15.417 --> 01:16:17.670
Remissions occur.

01:16:20.708 --> 01:16:22.176
- Davey's not in his room.
- What?

01:16:22.208 --> 01:16:23.835
- But I found this.
- Darling.

01:16:24.083 --> 01:16:26.302
The noise at the door.

01:16:26.333 --> 01:16:28.756
If he overheard me... Christ.

01:16:28.792 --> 01:16:31.545
Oh, wait till I find
that little shit!

01:16:31.583 --> 01:16:33.743
Five minutes ago, you thought
he was the second coming.

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:36.717
' <i>'</i> Davey!

01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:39.424
Come on, Soda. Where's Davey?

01:16:39.458 --> 01:16:41.586
Davey!

01:16:41.625 --> 01:16:43.423
Davey!

01:16:44.792 --> 01:16:46.465
Where are you?!

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:47.797
David!

01:16:47.833 --> 01:16:49.506
David!

01:16:49.542 --> 01:16:50.668
David!

01:16:50.708 --> 01:16:52.836
Davey!

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.127
David!

01:17:01.375 --> 01:17:04.219
- Darling!
- Davey!

01:17:24.583 --> 01:17:26.836
Simon, bring Soda here!

01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:30.717
- What have you got, Ted?
- His pajamas.

01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:33.720
Okay. Hey. Hey.

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:36.754
Huh? Go on, find Davey.

01:17:36.792 --> 01:17:39.591
I think he's got something.

01:17:39.625 --> 01:17:41.172
- David!
- Find Davey, Soda.

01:17:41.208 --> 01:17:44.291
- David! David!
- Find Davey, Soda.

01:17:45.792 --> 01:17:47.260
What the hell is he playing at?

01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:59.833
We've got him! We've got him!

01:18:02.917 --> 01:18:05.386
- He's not breathing.
- Ted, let me.

01:18:05.417 --> 01:18:08.842
- Davey! Oh, God!
- Five, six, seven, eight, nine,

01:18:09.083 --> 01:18:12.132
ten, 11, 12, 13...

01:18:14.875 --> 01:18:18.209
Is he alright?

01:18:18.250 --> 01:18:20.969
- Help him!
- I'll call an ambulance.

01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:27.548
Righto. Thank you, darling.
Look, I'll go with him.

01:18:27.583 --> 01:18:30.666
- You follow with Simon.
- Okay, yes.

01:18:30.708 --> 01:18:32.551
I love you.

01:18:56.833 --> 01:18:59.177
Thank you, Ted.

01:18:59.208 --> 01:19:02.291
You... you did very well.

01:19:03.625 --> 01:19:04.842
It was nothing.

01:19:07.792 --> 01:19:10.170
I've been a terrible father.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.209
You got carried away
with your own story.

01:19:20.083 --> 01:19:22.882
Something we're all
occasionally guilty of.

01:19:28.375 --> 01:19:30.628
Would you look after
things here?

01:20:05.375 --> 01:20:07.252
Swafford Hall.

01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:11.844
Yes, I'm her godfather.

01:20:15.875 --> 01:20:17.752
Yes.

01:20:22.583 --> 01:20:24.756
Yes, I'll tell her.

01:20:33.167 --> 01:20:35.761
Was that the hospital?

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.047
Yes.

01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:41.172
He could well have died
out there.

01:20:42.542 --> 01:20:44.544
Yes.

01:20:50.083 --> 01:20:53.132
But you couldn't help yourself.

01:20:53.167 --> 01:20:57.547
Your pompous speech,
tearing his ego to shreds.

01:20:57.583 --> 01:21:00.883
And you do realize,
if you're right,

01:21:01.125 --> 01:21:03.469
then my daughter is dying?

01:21:04.417 --> 01:21:06.795
I know.

01:21:07.042 --> 01:21:11.718
Can't resist grandstanding,
can you?

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.752
Have to be the smartest person
in the room.

01:21:13.792 --> 01:21:16.716
I know.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.434
No matter what damage
it does to those around you.

01:21:18.458 --> 01:21:20.802
I know.

01:21:20.833 --> 01:21:22.756
I know.

01:21:24.042 --> 01:21:25.042
I know.

01:21:25.125 --> 01:21:27.219

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:29.844

How's the magic-free life going?

Normal life.
It's a bit like hard work.

You'll get used to it.
