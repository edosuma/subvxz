Look at all these customers
from the Brooklyn midnight ride.

00:05.297 --> 00:07.031
I smell diner success!

00:07.033 --> 00:11.818
Really? 'Cause I smell baked crotch.

00:11.821 --> 00:12.954
Can balls fart?

00:12.956 --> 00:16.758
Because I feel like I'm smelling that too.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.192
Where is Oleg with my orders?

00:18.194 --> 00:19.911
If my tables don't get
food soon, they're gonna...

00:19.913 --> 00:21.996
Oh, my God, they're raising their arms.

00:21.998 --> 00:23.965
Ugh! Well, we know it wasn't a charity ride

00:23.967 --> 00:25.466
to raise money for deodorant.

00:25.468 --> 00:28.069
[Bell dinging] Oleg, where are my burgers?

00:28.071 --> 00:31.305
I'm a little in the weeds right now.

00:31.307 --> 00:33.708
You mean you smoked a
little weed right now?

00:33.710 --> 00:35.343
It's medicinal.

00:35.345 --> 00:38.279
Helps with my chronic erection.

00:38.281 --> 00:40.598
Can someone who's not in the grateful dead

00:40.600 --> 00:43.317
tell me how we're gonna get food?

00:43.319 --> 00:45.436
Follow me.

00:45.438 --> 00:47.105
You do plates, buns, coleslaw.

00:47.107 --> 00:48.222
I'll do burgers, fries,

00:48.224 --> 00:51.325
and any guy who has no future.

00:51.327 --> 00:53.828
Can you imagine if we
were born inside shells,

00:53.830 --> 00:57.899
and then even bigger animals
cracked us open to eat?

00:57.901 --> 01:00.084
Fries on the plates!

01:00.086 --> 01:02.737
Is anybody writing this gold down?

01:02.739 --> 01:05.423
[Slap]

01:05.425 --> 01:07.125
All right, Oleg. I want in.

01:07.127 --> 01:09.010

01:09.012 --> 01:10.678
or the...

Oh, my God, am I deaf?

01:20.974 --> 01:23.257
Wait, where is it?

01:23.259 --> 01:26.110
I put it somewhere.

Hey. I don't know where you guys are

01:54.415 --> 01:56.131
in your bike training.
Are we doping or deserting?

01:56.133 --> 01:57.883
I can help you either way.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.101
We're thinking about dessert.

01:59.103 --> 02:01.770
Cool, how about a Max's Homemade Cupcake?

02:01.772 --> 02:03.188
Eh, I don't think so.

02:03.190 --> 02:04.256
How's that cherry pie?

02:04.258 --> 02:06.275
Nice. The family of mice that lives in it

just renewed their lease.

02:09.896 --> 02:12.031
So, a Max's Homemade Cupcake?

You keep saying "Max's Homemade Cupcakes"

02:14.101 --> 02:15.284
like it's a thing.

02:15.286 --> 02:16.352
I've never heard of it.

02:16.354 --> 02:18.770
I haven't either. And we know a lot.

02:18.772 --> 02:24.710
And yet you put that

- Yeah, who's Max?

- What?
- Nothing.

02:41.978 --> 02:43.045
Caroline,

02:43.047 --> 02:45.814
you know I'm not one to gossip,

02:45.816 --> 02:47.299
but just about 30 seconds ago,

02:47.301 --> 02:49.301
I saw Max drop some major attitude

02:49.303 --> 02:51.803
and blow a chance with a
possible cupcake customer.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.439
That's your gossip?

02:53.441 --> 02:55.607
That Max has an attitude?

02:55.609 --> 02:58.477
What are you gonna tell me
next, that Elton John is gay?

02:58.479 --> 03:01.080

03:01.082 --> 03:05.701
bitch needs to take it down a notch.

03:05.703 --> 03:10.923
Bitch needs to mind his own business.

03:10.925 --> 03:15.210
Max, did you blow a possible
cupcake customer tonight?

03:15.212 --> 03:20.883
You know I don't mix
business with pleasure.

03:20.885 --> 03:22.834
We have to keep pushing our cupcakes.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.771
Every table, every time,
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes."

03:25.773 --> 03:26.855
I did.

03:26.857 --> 03:28.507
I said my name to that table more times

03:28.509 --> 03:30.909
than my mother said it my entire life.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.561
But you can't just say the name.

03:32.563 --> 03:34.012
You have to really sell it. [Scoffs]

03:34.014 --> 03:35.447
You should see me out there.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.282

03:40.454 --> 03:41.820
Stop.

03:41.822 --> 03:45.741
I can't believe I'm saying
this, but I am not a whore.

03:45.743 --> 03:47.493
Oh, you're a cupcake whore,

03:47.495 --> 03:51.029
and right now I'm your pimp, so...

03:51.031 --> 03:52.214
How many did you sell tonight?

03:52.216 --> 03:54.917
Two. Don't hit me, daddy!

03:54.919 --> 03:56.385
[Laughter]

03:56.387 --> 03:58.687
Okay, how many did you sell tonight?

03:58.689 --> 04:01.706
I sold... two.

04:01.708 --> 04:02.841
[Sighs]

04:02.843 --> 04:04.493
Okay, we're bad whores.

04:04.495 --> 04:06.812
No, we are tired whores.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.097
It's not the end of the world.

04:08.099 --> 04:10.516
We're just letting a

You just put everything into perspective.

04:18.608 --> 04:21.642

"it's so bad for business."

04:21.644 --> 04:23.979
And right now they're in the
kitchen having huge fight.

04:23.981 --> 04:29.151

Ready to go, Sophie?

04:40.297 --> 04:42.464
And girls, sorry to hear
your business broke up

04:42.466 --> 04:46.135
and you aren't speaking.

04:47.887 --> 04:48.937
We scared him.

04:48.939 --> 04:52.141
Now he's gonna run under the stove.

04:52.143 --> 04:54.443
I'm gonna make some calls to help you.

04:54.445 --> 04:56.195
Get you some big party jobs.

04:56.197 --> 04:58.230
That's so nice of you, Sophie.

04:58.232 --> 04:59.565
We really appreciate it.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.867
You girls can make some big money.

05:01.869 --> 05:05.904

05:05.906 --> 05:10.108
Um, no, I do not know.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.827
What the hell is Duza Day?

05:11.829 --> 05:16.582
Oh, Duza Day is huge
holiday in Polish community.

05:16.584 --> 05:19.284
When a Polish girl reaches six feet,

05:19.286 --> 05:22.337
you give her big party.

05:22.339 --> 05:26.558
I had mine when I was seven.

05:28.044 --> 05:31.230

05:31.232 --> 05:32.414

05:32.416 --> 05:34.233
or can anyone join?

05:36.237 --> 05:38.937
- What are you watching?
- My favorite show.

with two heads, one torso?

05:42.693 --> 05:43.775

05:43.777 --> 05:46.195
They fought about a necklace. [Laughs]

05:46.197 --> 05:48.146
<i>Now I'm watching Cupcake Wars.</i>

05:48.148 --> 05:50.115
<i>If our team wins Cupcake Wars,</i>

05:50.117 --> 05:51.533
we're gonna use the $10,000 prize

05:51.535 --> 05:53.818
to finally open up our own storefront.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.371
Wait, $10,000? What kind of show is this?

05:56.373 --> 05:58.090
I thought Google eliminated the need

05:58.092 --> 06:00.676
to ask questions out loud, but fine.

06:00.678 --> 06:01.877
It's a show on food network

06:01.879 --> 06:03.779
where teams make cupcakes
and compete for money.

06:03.781 --> 06:05.764
And why are we not on it?

06:05.766 --> 06:06.932
[Chuckles]

06:06.934 --> 06:08.267
Look at that dumb-dumb!

06:08.269 --> 06:10.168
She just dropped the pastry bag.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.220
Hey, they're called hands,

06:11.222 --> 06:13.272
learn how to use them, dumb-dumb!

06:13.274 --> 06:14.673
[Snickers]

06:14.675 --> 06:16.508
And that is why we're not on it.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.727
Not everyone's as judgmental as you.

06:18.729 --> 06:20.812
Oh, everyone's as judgmental as me.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.447
And I don't need some snarky bitch

06:22.449 --> 06:24.182
pointing at us on her TV going,

06:24.184 --> 06:25.350
"oh, look at that blonde dumb-dumb

06:25.352 --> 06:27.786
and her hot friend trying to do something."

06:27.788 --> 06:30.656
Max, why don't you ever let yourself dream?

06:30.658 --> 06:32.040
Because in my dreams,

06:32.042 --> 06:34.409
spiders are always eating my eyes.

06:34.411 --> 06:36.278
This might be the big push we need.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.880
<i>We can go on Cupcake Wars,</i>

06:37.882 --> 06:40.082
or we can keep being cupcake whores.

06:40.084 --> 06:41.250
Think about it.

06:41.252 --> 06:42.701
We wouldn't have to
go car-to-car anymore,

06:42.703 --> 06:44.670
we could actually open a brothel.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.255
Wait, if brothel's on the table,

06:46.257 --> 06:48.257
why don't we just forget
about this cupcake thing?

06:48.259 --> 06:50.475
'Cause that's a job I can do without pants.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.210
Seriously. Let's at least go to

06:52.212 --> 06:53.328
the food network and apply.

06:53.330 --> 06:54.813
That's not how it works.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.148
You fill out an application online,

06:56.150 --> 06:57.382
submit a two-minute home video,

06:57.384 --> 06:59.501
and then wait eight to
ten days for a response.

06:59.503 --> 07:01.803
Huh, caught you dreaming.

07:01.805 --> 07:05.557
All right, so maybe I thought
about it for, like, a second,

07:05.559 --> 07:06.758
when we first became a team.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.777
But then I remembered
the world's a dead-end

07:08.779 --> 07:10.362
and nothing good happens ever to anyone.

07:10.364 --> 07:11.496
There's a gun in that drawer.

07:11.498 --> 07:13.749
Do you want to just kill ourselves?

07:13.751 --> 07:15.784
Oh, Max.

07:15.786 --> 07:18.453
You finally called us a team.

07:18.455 --> 07:20.122
We are so going on that show.

07:20.124 --> 07:22.874
Seriously, I don't know
how Abby and Brittany do it,

07:22.876 --> 07:24.042
because I'm uncomfortable with you

07:24.044 --> 07:26.911
even sitting this close to me.

07:33.321 --> 07:34.988
Well, if we're making an audition tape

07:34.990 --> 07:36.190
to be on a reality show called,

07:36.192 --> 07:37.975
"the world's most uncomfortable t-shirt,"

07:37.977 --> 07:39.893
we have already won.

07:39.895 --> 07:43.013
Yes, I could have gotten
us a more expensive shirt

07:43.015 --> 07:44.932
at American Apparel, but then we would

07:44.934 --> 07:47.067
just look like people
pretending to be poor.

07:47.069 --> 07:51.105
And 13, and probably in the sex trade.

07:51.107 --> 07:52.573
I cannot believe you used your flat iron

07:52.575 --> 07:53.991
to put these letters on.

07:53.993 --> 07:56.660
Well, I can't believe you
once used it to make a panini,

07:56.662 --> 07:59.747
but... [scoffs] that's what happens now.

07:59.749 --> 08:01.865
Where's the scissors?
I gotta give this thing

08:01.867 --> 08:04.568
- some flave.
- Max, what are you doing?

08:04.570 --> 08:08.455
Crew necks are for squares and mormons.

08:08.457 --> 08:12.142
Oh, cute! Should we do mine?

08:12.144 --> 08:13.594
I don't know.

08:13.596 --> 08:17.998
If you have no car, why open the garage?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.467
[Laughter]

08:20.469 --> 08:22.636
So, I thought we'd shoot it over here

08:22.638 --> 08:25.889
in our adorable, scrappy,
low-income kitchen.

08:25.891 --> 08:27.591
Why are you talking like that?

08:27.593 --> 08:29.393
Because that's our brand.

08:29.395 --> 08:30.978
<i>I've watched a ton of Cupcake Wars,</i>

08:30.980 --> 08:32.145
and it's a lot about branding.

08:32.148 --> 08:33.363
And what are we?

08:33.365 --> 08:34.732
The girl who knows how to make cupcakes

08:34.734 --> 08:36.817
and the girl who doesn't?

08:36.818 --> 08:38.602
Max, I'm not worried about that.

08:38.604 --> 08:40.437
You'll just tell me what
to do, like you always do,

08:40.438 --> 08:43.273
and we'll be the two
scrappy girls with so little

08:43.275 --> 08:44.658
you can't help but love them.

08:44.660 --> 08:46.910
I hate them already.

08:46.912 --> 08:48.061
[Knock at door]

08:48.063 --> 08:49.496
Okay, that's Oleg.

08:49.498 --> 08:51.415
You did tell him he's
filming us for an audition

08:51.417 --> 08:52.900
and not making a porno, right?

08:52.902 --> 08:56.920
Yeah, I made it very clear.

08:56.922 --> 08:59.956
Why are your tops still on?

08:59.958 --> 09:01.508
And why isn't the plastic down?

09:01.510 --> 09:03.877
You're gonna get oil everywhere.

09:03.879 --> 09:06.730
Oleg, Max told you we're not
gonna make that kind of movie.

09:06.732 --> 09:09.132
I know, but so did every
girl that I worked with

09:09.134 --> 09:10.951
on "Backdoor Brides."

09:10.953 --> 09:13.570
And then again on "Backdoor Brides Two."

09:13.572 --> 09:17.691
But five minutes later, it
was "Here comes the bride."

09:17.693 --> 09:19.443
Oh, good.

09:19.445 --> 09:22.246
You still have your tops on.

09:22.248 --> 09:23.831
Yeah, they don't have to make

09:23.833 --> 09:25.649
girl-on-girl porn film for money.

09:25.651 --> 09:27.334
I got you big Duza Day party.

09:27.336 --> 09:29.169
300 cupcakes!

09:29.171 --> 09:31.505
Oh, my God! That's $1,200.

09:31.507 --> 09:34.591
No, it's for free.

09:34.593 --> 09:36.176
You do it for connections,

09:36.178 --> 09:39.012
and for the hot and cold pierogi buffet.

09:39.014 --> 09:40.547
Oh, Sophie, I don't know
if we should be taking

09:40.549 --> 09:41.799
free work right now.

09:41.801 --> 09:43.183
We're doing this TV
thing, and if we get it,

09:43.185 --> 09:44.968
we don't know what our schedule will be.

09:44.970 --> 09:50.257
Oh, I didn't know I was
talking to Cagney and Lacey.

09:50.259 --> 09:53.060
Yeah, well, suit yourself.

09:53.062 --> 09:54.561
We're sorry, Sophie.

09:54.563 --> 09:57.097
You have every right to be mad.

09:57.099 --> 09:59.316
Would a cupcake help?

09:59.318 --> 10:01.535
Always.

10:01.537 --> 10:05.322
Well, I just texted the
third girl not to come,

10:05.324 --> 10:08.642
so let's get this over with.

10:08.644 --> 10:10.711
This is so exciting. We're gonna be great.

10:10.713 --> 10:12.846
- We got this, girl.
- Okay, stop.

10:12.848 --> 10:15.415
On every reality show,
people say lame things

10:15.417 --> 10:16.633
that we can never say.

10:16.635 --> 10:18.635
No fist bumping. No high fives.

10:18.637 --> 10:21.037
You can't tell me to
"bring it," "shut it down,"

10:21.039 --> 10:23.006
or "put our cupcake business on the map."

10:23.008 --> 10:25.709
You can't tell me to "go,
girl"" or "bring my 'a' game,"

10:25.711 --> 10:27.477
and we don't "got this." Cool?

10:27.479 --> 10:28.595
Cool.

10:28.597 --> 10:32.850
- But we do got this, right?
- Yeah, we got this.

10:32.852 --> 10:34.585
Okay, here we go, girls.

10:34.587 --> 10:39.189
Arch your backs. Sorry, force of habit.

10:39.191 --> 10:40.274
Action.

10:40.276 --> 10:41.942
Hey, what's up? I'm Max,

10:41.944 --> 10:43.660
and this is my partner, Caroline.

10:43.662 --> 10:45.696
And we're Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

10:45.698 --> 10:50.234
And by homemade, I mean, "Ho!-Made."

10:50.236 --> 10:52.870
[Laughs] You go, girl!

10:56.090 --> 10:59.009
- We are an online bakery...
- Well, we have a website.

10:59.011 --> 11:01.545
And we're based right here
in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

11:01.547 --> 11:03.630
And this is where the magic happens.

11:03.632 --> 11:06.383
This is our kitchen-slash-
living room-slash-my bedroom...

11:06.385 --> 11:08.585
Slash my wrists, 'cause
I'm trying to bake all night

11:08.587 --> 11:11.038
while she's sleeping over there.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.223
And here is our purple stove.

11:13.225 --> 11:14.424
Just because you're poor,

11:14.426 --> 11:16.393
that doesn't mean you can't have style.

11:16.395 --> 11:18.862
Or a horse that just came in unannounced.

11:18.864 --> 11:20.647
Oh, this is Chestnut.

11:20.649 --> 11:22.149
He's our test audience.

11:22.151 --> 11:23.450
But we don't feed him chocolate.

11:23.452 --> 11:25.118
'Cause that would kill him.

11:25.120 --> 11:28.956
[Mouth full] They have a horse!

11:28.958 --> 11:33.493
So pick us because we're hard
workers, we love the show,

11:33.495 --> 11:37.080
and we're females getting
their own, on their own.

11:37.082 --> 11:39.132
And cut! That was so great.

11:39.134 --> 11:41.117
Chestnut walking in out of nowhere,

11:41.119 --> 11:42.753
we could not have planned that.

11:42.755 --> 11:43.971
Oh, but I did.

11:43.973 --> 11:45.672
That's our gimmick. Try to beat that.

11:45.674 --> 11:47.057
Two girls with a horse.

12:39.278 --> 12:40.444
Janis, B.Y.O.B.?

12:40.446 --> 12:41.728
"Bring your own brand."

12:41.730 --> 12:43.113

12:49.955 --> 12:54.241
The double-d's and the ditz.

12:54.243 --> 12:56.543
I went to wharton. I'm not a ditz.

12:56.545 --> 12:59.362
Well you ain't the double-d's.

12:59.364 --> 13:03.467

commented on m'goods?

13:03.469 --> 13:05.052
All right, we're ready for team one.

13:05.054 --> 13:07.554
Step up.

13:07.556 --> 13:09.723
You have 30 seconds.

13:09.725 --> 13:12.542
Okay, cute aprons. But what's their brand?

13:12.544 --> 13:15.012
In five, four, three, two...

13:15.014 --> 13:17.213
- Hi, I'm Felicia.
- And I'm Blanche,

13:17.215 --> 13:19.549

13:19.551 --> 13:22.486
Both: We're talking
about New Orleans, y'all!

13:22.488 --> 13:25.522
Cute accents, but no one has
a scrappier story than us.

13:25.524 --> 13:28.725
Back in 2005, when hurricane Katrina hit...

13:28.727 --> 13:30.494
Say what?

13:30.496 --> 13:33.163
And the levee broke and
flooded our whole neighborhood.

13:33.165 --> 13:34.281
Say what?

13:34.283 --> 13:36.900
Our community was
devastated, and we thought,

13:36.902 --> 13:38.952
"hell yes, Katrina hit us hard."

13:38.954 --> 13:41.254
"But hell no! We're not giving up."

13:41.256 --> 13:44.458
We needed to find a way
to keep on keepin' on.

13:44.460 --> 13:48.178
Katrina? Their brand is Katrina?

13:48.180 --> 13:50.914

13:50.916 --> 13:53.066

14:13.021 --> 14:15.939
"Max's narcissistic cupcakes"?

14:15.941 --> 14:17.991
We're fine. Don't freak out.

14:17.993 --> 14:19.609

We're not going anywhere.

18:29.863 --> 18:31.296
I'm on my show and I'm losing.

18:31.298 --> 18:33.698
Forget we're on the show.

18:33.700 --> 18:36.168
Pretend we're in the
diner, and Oleg is stoned,

18:36.170 --> 18:37.502
and we have all these ingredients

18:37.504 --> 18:38.720
and we just got slammed with people

18:38.722 --> 18:40.839
who all want cupcakes.
What do you tell me to do?

18:40.841 --> 18:42.007
Well, first, I tell you to leave

18:42.009 --> 18:45.543
so I can get stoned with Oleg.

18:45.545 --> 18:47.128
Okay, if I was stoned,

18:47.130 --> 18:49.764
what would I know about soul food?

18:49.766 --> 18:51.233
Ludacris!

18:51.235 --> 18:52.383
Is always talking about

18:52.385 --> 18:54.653
how much he loves waffles with chicken.

18:54.655 --> 18:55.887
Chicken and waffle cupcake!

18:55.889 --> 18:57.489
Yes! Chicken and waffles!

18:57.491 --> 18:58.690
You better watch it, girls.

18:58.692 --> 18:59.908
Here comes chicken and waffles

18:59.910 --> 19:01.776
from big boobs and try hard.

19:01.778 --> 19:03.028
As Ludacris would say,

19:03.030 --> 19:05.697
move, bitch, get out the way.

19:05.699 --> 19:07.082
Let's go, girl. We gotta bring it.

19:07.084 --> 19:09.868
We gotta shut this down. We
are bringing our "a" game.

19:09.870 --> 19:11.569
It's time to put our
cupcake business on the map.

19:11.571 --> 19:13.088
We got this. Oh, my God.

19:13.090 --> 19:16.374
I said them all. [Laughs]

19:16.376 --> 19:18.877
Empty the mixer. We still have time.

19:18.879 --> 19:20.045
[Whirring]

19:20.047 --> 19:23.965
Oh!

19:23.967 --> 19:25.934
[Laughs]

19:25.936 --> 19:29.387
Look at the blonde dumb-dumb.

19:33.276 --> 19:37.195
Congratulations, Max!

19:37.197 --> 19:39.030
Sophie, we didn't get it.

19:39.032 --> 19:42.868
Oh, congratulations, Caroline!

19:42.870 --> 19:44.786
Sophie, I told you, we didn't get picked.

19:44.788 --> 19:46.121
What am I supposed to do,

19:46.123 --> 19:48.490
walk around with a purse full of confetti?

19:48.492 --> 19:50.625
I'm so sorry, ladies.

19:50.627 --> 19:51.910
But you know what they say,

19:51.912 --> 19:55.247
when God closes a door, you work here.

19:55.249 --> 19:56.915
It just wasn't our day.

19:56.917 --> 19:58.250
We got flustered at first,

19:58.252 --> 20:00.001
but we did end up making a great cupcake.

20:00.003 --> 20:01.086
Oh, say it.

20:01.088 --> 20:03.788
We got hit by hurricane Katrina.

20:03.790 --> 20:04.923
True. Hard to believe,

20:04.925 --> 20:06.474
but the other team had a better brand.

20:06.476 --> 20:08.343
Oh, please.

20:08.345 --> 20:11.796
Blaming it on a disaster from years ago.

20:11.798 --> 20:13.598
Well, Sophie, you weren't
there, so I don't think you...

20:13.600 --> 20:17.419
- Oh, I don't want to hear it!
- [Sputters]

20:17.421 --> 20:21.323
I mean, you had huge
opportunity with Duza Day.

20:21.325 --> 20:23.074
But you passed on the real job

20:23.076 --> 20:25.994
waiting for your big break on the TV show,

20:25.996 --> 20:29.831
just like everyone else in America.

20:29.833 --> 20:31.700
So you tried to take a shortcut to success

20:31.702 --> 20:35.987
and you end up with a
mouth full of confetti.

20:36.772 --> 20:38.073
Sophie's right.

20:38.075 --> 20:40.442
We went on television with
the ridiculous expectation

20:40.444 --> 20:42.127
that we'd make it overnight.

20:42.129 --> 20:43.261
But that's not who we are.

20:43.263 --> 20:44.879
We're gonna have to do it the hard way.

20:44.881 --> 20:49.134
Slow and steady. The
tortoise and the whore.

20:50.836 --> 20:52.503
Well, what can I say, "caramel?"

20:52.505 --> 20:56.191
By the way, that's your whore name.

20:56.193 --> 21:00.345
Looks like it's back to
selling cakes one car at a time.

21:00.347 --> 21:03.448
I'll just put these "Ludacris
Specials" in the display case.

21:03.450 --> 21:05.450
You do that, "Cinnamon."

21:05.452 --> 21:07.786
Oh, no, I actually have a whore name,

21:07.788 --> 21:11.122
and that's not it.

21:11.124 --> 21:12.240
What is it?

21:12.242 --> 21:16.861
Max. Duh.
