00:05.673 --> 00:08.467
<i>Hey, Dad, welcome to Railton.</i>

00:08.467 --> 00:11.137
<i>Just a couple questions.</i>

00:11.137 --> 00:13.431
<i>How come you didn't come to my wedding?</i>

00:13.431 --> 00:17.017
<i>Or want to meet your only grandchild?</i>

00:17.017 --> 00:20.855
<i>Or how could you abandon me</i>

00:20.855 --> 00:23.065
<i>when I had a rope around my neck?</i>

00:23.065 --> 00:25.985
<i>That's it, just those questions.</i>

00:25.985 --> 00:28.988
<i>Feel free to write
your answers on a postcard</i>

00:28.988 --> 00:31.323
<i>and mail it to me.</i>

00:32.450 --> 00:36.579
<i>Then we can go back
to avoiding each other.</i>

01:53.197 --> 01:54.448
I'm coming in!

01:54.448 --> 01:56.325
Dad! Get out!

02:03.415 --> 02:04.625
Hm...

02:11.757 --> 02:13.843
I almost took a shower with our daughter.

02:13.843 --> 02:15.469
She came in the night.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.887
She slept in her old room.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.180
What's that about?

02:18.180 --> 02:19.431
Mm...

02:19.431 --> 02:22.059
She didn't want to say,
she wanted to sleep.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.769
If we turned her room into a gym,

02:23.769 --> 02:25.020
this wouldn't happen.

02:25.020 --> 02:27.189
Or she'd get into great shape.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.316
- Bright side.
- Mm.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.950
- I saw my father on Tuesday.
- What?

02:39.910 --> 02:42.454
I was in my car.
I just wanted to get a glimpse.

02:42.454 --> 02:43.664
There he was.

02:46.292 --> 02:49.837
What did he say? Or just how... did it go?

02:49.837 --> 02:51.338
We didn't talk.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.173
I don't want to be lied to,

02:53.173 --> 02:58.053
and I only want to know
he's here because he's old,

02:58.053 --> 03:01.056
unemployed, and wants to be taken care of.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.685
- That's understandable.
- I'm going for a run.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.562
- Great.
- That's... important.

03:06.562 --> 03:07.980
Oh, it's my mom.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.607
Oh, yeah, she's been calling me.

03:09.607 --> 03:11.025
You too?

03:11.025 --> 03:14.028
- Did you talk to her?
- No, I wouldn't know what to say to her.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.825
Why haven't you answered my calls?

03:21.201 --> 03:24.121
Because my, um, caller ID works.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.125
You hurt your father very badly, you know.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.169
He played me the message you left.

03:30.169 --> 03:31.879
Oh, he's keeping my messages.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.339
What message?

03:33.339 --> 03:35.090
I left a message for my dad.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.301
I told him he's not welcome
here in Railton.

03:37.301 --> 03:40.596
It was a cruel thing to say.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.431
It stung him very badly.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.433
It was so over the line,

03:44.433 --> 03:45.976
Henry says he's leaving after the weekend.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.020
He says he's going to North Carolina.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.105
North Carolina? What's in North Carolina?

03:50.105 --> 03:51.440
Oh,

03:51.440 --> 03:53.817
a graduate student
that he hasn't seduced yet.

03:53.817 --> 03:57.571
- Gruen.
- What's that, the monster from <i>Beowulf?</i>

03:57.571 --> 03:59.073
His second wife.

04:00.532 --> 04:03.744
It would be a terrible situation for him,

04:03.744 --> 04:06.914
living out the last of his days

04:06.914 --> 04:09.249
in a place he has no connection to,

04:09.249 --> 04:12.336
far from any family...

04:12.336 --> 04:14.129
And the monster's Grendel.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.714
Well, you tell him
to have a nice trip,

04:15.714 --> 04:18.926
and the monster is Grendel's mom.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.302
Hank!

04:20.302 --> 04:23.389
This is something
that's very important to me.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.474
He'll leave for good

04:25.474 --> 04:28.143
if you don't come by and ask him to stay.

04:29.812 --> 04:31.480
I'm not going to do that.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.858
I'm asking you.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.945
Hank isn't available this weekend.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.906
He has a conference.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.950
Is that true?

04:42.950 --> 04:45.202
It's true I've been invited
to a conference,

04:45.202 --> 04:46.662
in Harrisburg.

04:46.662 --> 04:49.039
Oh, you can skip that.

04:49.665 --> 04:51.583
You have a choice to make

04:51.583 --> 04:53.961
between your father

04:53.961 --> 04:57.256
and an insignificant regional conference.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.754
It's good for guys to have a thing.

06:18.754 --> 06:20.297
This conference is kind of our thing.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.801
And the one year you decided to pull out

06:23.801 --> 06:25.135
is the one year I'm presenting.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.553
I was beginning to take it personally.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.348
Yeah, I've had
a lot going on, you know.

06:29.348 --> 06:30.933
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

06:30.933 --> 06:33.310
It's just that you decided
not to come weeks ago,

06:33.310 --> 06:34.853
like the minute you saw the program

06:34.853 --> 06:36.980
with my name and photo
prominently displayed on it.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.941
- I did?
- Mm-hm.

06:38.941 --> 06:41.777
I think we have a different definition
of "prominent".

06:41.777 --> 06:43.362
It's page three. Page three is the best.

06:43.362 --> 06:44.738
Phew...

06:44.738 --> 06:47.116
I got two other pages
that will knock your socks off.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.743
Let's go.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.664
I hope I don't meet anyone from last year.

06:53.664 --> 06:55.207
- You probably won't.
- Or the year before.

06:55.207 --> 06:59.211
Uh, Rosencrantz
and <i>Senor</i> Guildenstern, please.

06:59.211 --> 07:00.629
How many times have you heard that today?

07:00.629 --> 07:02.339
Beats the Nietzsche brothers.

07:02.339 --> 07:03.674
No, it does not.

07:03.674 --> 07:05.843
Devereaux and Conigula.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.137
Go right to page three?

07:08.846 --> 07:10.639
Whoa, whoa.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.808
I did not know Gracie
was going to be here.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.935
Quick, hand me my fake mustache.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.270
You've got a beard.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.940
Right. So, my Austin Powers teeth.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.234
You're too kind.
Look at her, holding court.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.278
Wait till they find out she's an idiot.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.363
That <i>Atlantic</i> poem was a total fluke.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.656
It was one of those
infinite monkey things?

07:27.656 --> 07:29.616
Infinite monkey? No.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.618
Twenty monkeys,

07:31.618 --> 07:34.371
and they can take breaks,
and they need one typewriter.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.582
They'll poop out that poem in ten minutes.

07:36.582 --> 07:38.917
Come on.
- No, drinks first. Come on.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.127
I can't believe

07:40.252 --> 07:42.629
that was just your first poem
published in <i>The Atlantic.</i>

07:42.629 --> 07:45.090
- Wonderful.
- And such specificity.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.967
Do you write with a pen or a scalpel?

07:46.967 --> 07:48.844
Oh, please.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.888
You all honor me, truly.

07:50.888 --> 07:52.890
Honestly, I don't know what comes next.

07:52.890 --> 07:56.685
I'm just trying to slurp the marrow
from the present moment.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.187
Poet laureate, 5:00.
Dr. Grillo!

07:58.187 --> 07:59.354
What?

07:59.479 --> 08:02.107
Ms. DuBois, when I read your poem
in <i>The Atlantic,</i>

08:02.107 --> 08:03.817
I revisited your book of sonnets.

08:03.817 --> 08:07.029
I've added it to the syllabus
for my spring seminar.

08:07.029 --> 08:09.489
I'm collecting selected poems

08:09.907 --> 08:12.492
for an anthology of contemporary poets

08:12.492 --> 08:14.244
re-imagining traditional forms.

08:14.244 --> 08:17.414
I would love to include
a villanelle of yours.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.957
Let's get a drink later.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.918
I would love that. I would...

08:25.047 --> 08:27.674
I do remember you, yes.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.301
You had a hat with a feather,

08:29.468 --> 08:30.510
and the feather blew off

08:30.510 --> 08:32.596
and landed in a lady's drink, right?

08:32.596 --> 08:34.264
Uh, that was you.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.308
I prefer to be remembered for my work...

08:36.308 --> 08:37.392
- Well...
- ...but I'll take it.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.811
Hank's a novelist,
so it's his job to be kind of a dick.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.104
Ah.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.189
When do you present?

08:42.356 --> 08:43.440
Tomorrow afternoon.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.652
I have a paper on Ecophilosophy
in a Post-Roe World.

08:46.652 --> 08:48.528
How about you, Hank?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.322
Are you presenting?

08:50.322 --> 08:53.450
- I don't know.
- You don't know if you're presenting?

08:53.450 --> 08:56.787
You were saying about Appiah's
piece in the <i>Times</i> last Sunday?

08:56.787 --> 08:58.080
Absolute rubbish.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.748
This widower wrote in

08:59.748 --> 09:02.376
to ask if it would be ethical
to read his deceased...

09:02.376 --> 09:03.460
Sorry.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.713
...and asked him specifically not to do.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.884
Uh, gin martini, extra olives, please.

09:31.446 --> 09:32.489
Thank you.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.632
That would be a mistake.
- What?

09:51.550 --> 09:54.636
That woman you followed in here.

09:54.636 --> 09:57.055
"Anna Howard, professor
of comparative literature,

09:57.055 --> 09:58.223
"University of Michigan."

09:58.223 --> 09:59.975
However tempting,
a dalliance for a dalliance

09:59.975 --> 10:01.685
is not an ethically-sound idea.

10:02.686 --> 10:03.979
I shouldn't be here.

10:03.979 --> 10:06.315
You're my biggest fan. I'm on page three.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.361
I'm afraid I'm going to do
something stupid.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.779
Let me get you a drink.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.324
After that, get a massage, take a schvitz.

10:15.324 --> 10:16.825
Do any stupid thing you want,

10:16.825 --> 10:19.369
except boink her, 'cause you'd regret it.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.464
<i>When am I going to learn</i>

10:30.464 --> 10:33.133
<i>that hotel rooms aren't fun anymore?</i>

10:33.133 --> 10:35.844
<i>I mean, when you're young,
they're full of potential,</i>

10:35.844 --> 10:39.348
<i>an exotic alternative

10:44.144 --> 10:47.314
<i>about all the losers

10:48.273 --> 10:49.983
<i>Oh, that's sad.</i>

10:51.443 --> 10:52.652
<i>All the losers,</i>

11:10.003 --> 11:11.254
Hey!

11:11.254 --> 11:13.131
- Do you need a hand?
- Hi, yeah.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.550
Can you put this in the very front.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.886
Are you finally moving your stuff out?

11:17.886 --> 11:19.971
How many times
are we going to talk about this?

11:19.971 --> 11:22.349
Is it such an inconvenience
for me to keep, like,

11:22.349 --> 11:24.184
a bit of my stuff at your house?

11:24.184 --> 11:26.186
I thought you liked
having this conversation.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.814
I thought that's why
you kept your things here

11:28.814 --> 11:31.817
even though you have
your own big storage space.

11:31.817 --> 11:32.984
Trunk.

11:35.612 --> 11:36.780
Are you going somewhere?

11:36.780 --> 11:38.490
Yeah, Russell and I had a fight,

11:38.490 --> 11:40.742
so I'm going to take you up on that offer.

11:40.742 --> 11:41.910
What offer?

11:41.910 --> 11:44.079
I'm going to come
stay with you in New York.

11:44.538 --> 11:45.914
Okay, let's just, um...

11:45.914 --> 11:47.374
Let's just back this up.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.667
How bad a fight was this?

11:48.667 --> 11:50.293
That's none of your business.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.754
Julie!

11:52.754 --> 11:54.131
- Mom.
- You are married.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.966
You cannot just run away

11:55.966 --> 11:57.384
from the first big fight.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.594
First big fight.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.263
Mom, Russell literally is like...

12:01.263 --> 12:02.431
Mom!

12:03.056 --> 12:04.975
Russell is just...

12:04.975 --> 12:06.476
He's pissing me off,

12:06.476 --> 12:08.895
and this is...
Honestly, this is all Dad's fault.

12:08.895 --> 12:09.980
How so?

12:09.980 --> 12:13.525
Because he got him that job,
and it destroyed us.

12:13.525 --> 12:14.651
It just destroyed us.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.945
Like, I honestly don't think we've had sex

12:16.945 --> 12:19.156
more than, like, ten times
in the last month.

12:19.156 --> 12:21.074
Oh, yeah?
- Yes,

12:21.074 --> 12:23.160
and he's not masturbating like he used to,

12:23.160 --> 12:24.995
so he's totally cheating on me.

12:25.620 --> 12:26.705
Julie.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.707
Honey, do you... Do you really think so?

12:28.707 --> 12:30.500
- I mean...
- Yes.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.468
Yeah, I'm at work.

12:39.468 --> 12:42.721
<i>- ♪ Keep it round... ♪</i>
- It's a great time to talk.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.098
<i>♪ Hold onto it... ♪</i>

12:45.098 --> 12:46.266
...and they brought nothing.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.726
Nothing.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.936
When I go to her house,
I bring banana bread,

12:49.936 --> 12:51.021
or a zucchini bread,

12:51.021 --> 12:52.481
a bottle of wine, something,

12:52.481 --> 12:54.065
and this is the third time it's happened

12:54.065 --> 12:55.233
where she shows up empty-handed.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.485
I just think it's disrespectful.

12:56.485 --> 12:57.819
At this point, she should not

Dad?

13:52.666 --> 13:53.708
How did you...

13:56.878 --> 13:59.631
Apparently, you have a beef with me.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.843
And it boils down to one thing.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.845
How could you leave us?

14:05.845 --> 14:08.348
Me,

14:08.348 --> 14:11.893
the way that you did.

14:11.893 --> 14:14.479
That's a fair question.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.356
Look, son,

14:16.356 --> 14:17.607
there are three things

14:17.607 --> 14:19.317
that you don't know about the situation.

14:26.575 --> 14:29.452
you might even be happy.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.924
I hear the sounds
of a party down the hall.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.634
Female voices.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.094
<i>What time is it?</i>

16:09.094 --> 16:11.680
Are you already in bed?

16:11.680 --> 16:13.515
<i>Yeah. My presentation is in the morning.</i>

16:13.515 --> 16:14.641
<i>You're coming, right?</i>

16:14.641 --> 16:16.267
Of course.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.894
It's hours away.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.647
I mean, come on,
I really need a distraction.

16:44.713 --> 16:46.756
Ooh, what are the specials?

16:46.756 --> 16:49.926
We have vodka and soda,

16:49.926 --> 16:51.720
and...

16:51.720 --> 16:53.638
Soda with vodka in it.

16:53.638 --> 16:54.973
Oh, that's a tough choice.

16:54.973 --> 16:57.142
I'd say soda with vodka?

16:57.934 --> 17:00.270
I'm going to look for
some of those female voices.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.479
Cheers.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.031
<i>Hard to believe,</i>

17:12.031 --> 17:15.160
<i>but these are some of
the most above-average minds in academia.</i>

17:16.786 --> 17:18.538
<i>Why are they here?</i>

17:18.538 --> 17:20.749
<i>Will they change the world?</i>

17:21.124 --> 17:23.960
<i>Not unless being published
in an academic journal</i>

17:23.960 --> 17:25.420
<i>read by 40 people</i>

17:25.420 --> 17:26.921
<i>is earth-shattering.</i>

17:26.921 --> 17:28.840
<i>No, these people
are in a fierce competition.</i>

17:28.840 --> 17:30.008
I don't know.

17:30.008 --> 17:32.343
A provocative thesis is one thing,

17:32.343 --> 17:35.805
but Marjorie DeCampos
is going to be there.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.348
From Emory?
- Yes.

17:37.348 --> 17:39.726
<i>They're battling to see
who can stick their heads</i>

17:39.726 --> 17:42.395
<i>furthest up their own butt holes.</i>

17:42.395 --> 17:43.897
<i>Ah, maybe I can help.</i>

17:43.897 --> 17:45.315
Make sure you have a printout.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.441
Why?

17:46.441 --> 17:48.026
Uh, the virus.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.945
What virus?

17:50.945 --> 17:52.781
- You guys don't know?
- No.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.449
Oh.

17:54.449 --> 17:57.702
There's a computer virus
being spread by the hotel WiFi.

17:57.702 --> 17:58.995
Oh, no.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.914
Some hacker from outside
infected the whole system.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.832
- When?
- Like an hour ago.

18:02.832 --> 18:05.543
They've got an IT team
from Zurich is working on it,

18:05.543 --> 18:07.796
but I lost work from the last four years,

18:07.796 --> 18:09.714
so... effing nightmare.

18:09.714 --> 18:10.882
I'm so sorry.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.258
It probably won't affect you guys

18:12.258 --> 18:16.179
because it only activates
if you use certain programs.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.723
- Word, or Google Docs...
- Oh, that's fine.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.683
...or, um...
PowerPoint, and Keynote.

18:20.683 --> 18:21.768
Oh, my God!

18:21.768 --> 18:22.894
- What?
- Yeesh!

18:22.894 --> 18:25.063
- That's everything.
- I'll tell you what,

18:25.063 --> 18:26.773
it'll destroy your hard drive. Good luck.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.316
My presentation is in Keynote.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.777
Yeah, but mine is tomorrow. I have two!

18:30.777 --> 18:32.070
I have two presentations.

18:34.072 --> 18:36.991
<i>I have to operate
my happy family of clothing.</i>

18:36.991 --> 18:38.827
<i>Because it's
a charity rummage sale.</i>

18:38.827 --> 18:40.036
<i>I know!</i>

18:40.036 --> 18:41.120
<i>That you helped organize!</i>

18:41.120 --> 18:42.997
This is the best.

18:42.997 --> 18:45.250
This could be every night in New York.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.252
Hm.

18:47.669 --> 18:50.338
There's lots of stuff to do
in New York at night.

18:50.338 --> 18:52.298
Yeah, but what's better than this?

18:54.425 --> 18:55.885
<i>Get out of the way.</i>

18:55.885 --> 18:57.387
<i>What are you doing?</i>

18:57.387 --> 18:58.763
<i>Get away from the closet.</i>

18:58.763 --> 19:01.182
<i>No! Not that one! Oh!</i>

20:03.661 --> 20:05.580
I see you bought your own coffee.

20:05.580 --> 20:06.873
Smart move.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.167
They're feeding us battery acid over here.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.460
Hank.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.378
Anna.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.172
You're one of the panelists, right?

20:14.172 --> 20:15.381
You're the Bronte scholar?

20:15.381 --> 20:17.425
- That's right.
- Where did you study?

20:17.425 --> 20:19.344
Northwestern.

20:19.344 --> 20:20.553
Grad school?

20:20.553 --> 20:21.888
Columbia.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.848
See, I think we have someone in common.

20:23.848 --> 20:26.392
- Mm.
- Henry Devereaux?

20:28.269 --> 20:29.646
Henry?

20:29.646 --> 20:31.105
Of course.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.274
Yeah, he was my thesis advisor.

20:33.274 --> 20:34.651
He was a real mentor to me.

20:35.526 --> 20:36.986
Just a mentor?

20:39.322 --> 20:41.616
So, did you study under him as well, or...

20:41.616 --> 20:43.618
No, but I know you did.

20:46.829 --> 20:47.914
I'm his son.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.963
Do you want something from me?

20:56.130 --> 20:57.465
Not really.

20:57.465 --> 20:58.841
Well, that's not true.

21:02.053 --> 21:03.304
Did he ever mention

21:03.304 --> 21:06.766
that he had a son around your age?

21:06.766 --> 21:09.978
I knew you existed, yeah.

21:09.978 --> 21:12.313
Did he express any affection,

21:12.313 --> 21:14.607
or have any fond memories?

21:14.607 --> 21:15.942
It's hard to remember.

21:20.488 --> 21:21.531
How about for you?

21:21.531 --> 21:23.825
Do you feel like he cared about you?

21:24.200 --> 21:26.703
Do you think he's capable...

21:26.703 --> 21:29.247
Of caring?

21:31.207 --> 21:32.583
You should talk to him.

21:34.794 --> 21:35.962
He's a...

21:38.172 --> 21:40.258
He's a good man.

21:41.342 --> 21:42.969
Is he?

21:58.317 --> 22:01.279
...poetic voice,
so readily identifiable,

22:01.279 --> 22:03.573
her brachyology, use of rhetorical terms,

22:03.573 --> 22:05.158
wielding rhetorical devices,

22:05.158 --> 22:07.160
syllepsis and apokoinou

22:07.160 --> 22:08.870
like hatchets to her text

22:08.870 --> 22:10.872
while she creates a syntax

22:10.872 --> 22:12.040
for an urban landscape

22:12.040 --> 22:13.958
she both describes and rebirths--

22:13.958 --> 22:16.794
I think I'm going to have
to challenge you on that, Fran--

22:16.794 --> 22:18.004
Okay!

22:18.004 --> 22:19.464
Oh, here we go!

22:19.464 --> 22:21.215
Why is it that we...

22:21.215 --> 22:23.342
<i>How can someone
not be self-aware enough</i>

22:23.342 --> 22:25.511
<i>to know they are irrelevant?</i>

22:25.887 --> 22:28.306
<i>I mean, if your gut doesn't tell you this,</i>

22:28.306 --> 22:30.516
<i>there's a lot of clues.</i>

22:30.516 --> 22:31.809
<i>Just look around.</i>

22:31.809 --> 22:34.562
<i>There's 700 channels on TV,</i>

22:34.562 --> 22:38.232
<i>and not a single one of them

22:39.525 --> 22:41.110
<i>And you've accomplished</i>

22:41.110 --> 22:43.279

Come on!

24:40.646 --> 24:41.814
That's it, that's it!

24:44.442 --> 24:46.068
No. No...

24:46.068 --> 24:47.820
No, I don't want to hear it.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.865
You shouldn't have
stayed out late every night for a month.

24:50.865 --> 24:52.909
That's not someone wanting to be with me.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.995
How long does it take to put up chairs?

24:55.995 --> 24:57.288
There's, like, 30 chairs,

24:57.288 --> 24:58.748
and it takes five seconds a chair.

24:58.748 --> 25:00.041
That doesn't add up!

25:00.041 --> 25:01.209
That's just math!

25:09.175 --> 25:10.676
I'm just going to say something

25:10.676 --> 25:13.012
that you don't want to hear.

25:13.012 --> 25:16.182
Is it possible that he's just
actually working late?

25:16.182 --> 25:18.935
Yeah, but it's "why is he working late?"

25:18.935 --> 25:21.979
It's because he took a job
to be away from me,

25:21.979 --> 25:24.398
just like you're taking a job
to be away from Dad.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.609
That is not...

25:26.609 --> 25:27.693
That...

25:27.693 --> 25:29.487
That is not why I took this job.

25:29.487 --> 25:31.697
Oh, come on, it's me.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.407
Yes, I know who I'm talking to.

25:33.407 --> 25:35.493
Okay, calm down.

25:35.493 --> 25:38.496
- You guys are going through something.
- I get it.

25:39.288 --> 25:41.874
- No, you don't.
- So you and Dad are just perfect then?

25:41.874 --> 25:43.834
No. No, Julie, there are little things,

25:43.834 --> 25:45.169
but they're little things,

25:45.169 --> 25:47.046
and then when there's a bigger thing,

25:47.046 --> 25:49.090
then we work it out.

25:49.090 --> 25:50.591
That's what you want from me?

25:50.591 --> 25:52.510
- Yeah.
- You want me to work it out with Russell

25:52.510 --> 25:54.804
and stay with him,
and then in, like, 25 years,

25:54.804 --> 25:56.514
leave him in a cloud of denial?

25:56.514 --> 25:57.932
Oh!

25:58.975 --> 26:01.102
Oh, my God. Get in the car.

26:01.852 --> 26:03.396
We are going to talk to Russell.

26:03.396 --> 26:06.357
No, we're not doing that.
I want to finish the game.

26:06.357 --> 26:08.484
Get in the car.

26:08.484 --> 26:09.694
No!

26:24.458 --> 26:25.584
That was super mature.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.588
Come on!

26:29.588 --> 26:31.507
You got it! That's it!

26:35.136 --> 26:36.304
Aw!

26:51.485 --> 26:54.864
A little early, no?

26:54.864 --> 26:56.657
It was a disaster.

26:56.657 --> 26:58.743
- What was?
- What was? My talk was.

26:58.743 --> 27:00.536
I'm almost glad you weren't there.

27:01.454 --> 27:02.663
It doesn't matter.

27:02.663 --> 27:04.707
I just, I don't even know where to start.

27:06.334 --> 27:08.085
Can I get the same thing?

27:08.085 --> 27:10.629
Um...

27:10.629 --> 27:12.798
start in the middle?

27:12.798 --> 27:14.967
I missed a key paper last year.

27:15.801 --> 27:18.471
Everything I was saying
about the neuroscience of moral judgment

27:18.471 --> 27:20.014
was apparently made irrelevant

27:20.014 --> 27:21.766
in the third quarter of
the Journal of Neuroscience,

27:21.766 --> 27:23.225
which, in hindsight,

27:23.225 --> 27:26.228
may have been a pretty good thing
for me to have been reading.

27:26.228 --> 27:27.813
Well, let's...

27:27.813 --> 27:30.358
Let's qualify relevance here.
Relevant to who?

27:30.358 --> 27:32.693
I mean, how many people
showed up at this thing?

27:32.693 --> 27:34.320
What does that matter? It was my research.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.906
I'm just trying to put it
in perspective, right?

27:36.906 --> 27:39.158
It's not like you lost
a patient on the table.

27:42.036 --> 27:44.705
The whole thing
was extra embarrassing

27:44.705 --> 27:46.499
because I couldn't access my notes.

27:46.499 --> 27:49.168
There was a virus on the hotel WiFi.

27:52.046 --> 27:53.214
I heard that was a hoax.

27:53.589 --> 27:54.673
Oh, God...

27:55.007 --> 27:56.550
Go on.

27:56.550 --> 27:58.469
There's nothing to go on about.

27:58.969 --> 28:00.221
It was a nightmare.

28:00.221 --> 28:02.181
I can never come back here.

28:03.015 --> 28:05.559
I think you're wallowing.

28:06.519 --> 28:08.562
It wasn't that important to you yesterday,

28:08.562 --> 28:09.980
or the day before.

28:09.980 --> 28:11.899
I think you're sinking
into your feelings--

28:11.899 --> 28:13.776
Of course it was important
to me yesterday.

28:13.776 --> 28:16.529
This has been my work
for the last three years.

28:16.987 --> 28:20.533
Your work for the last three years
was getting laid

28:20.533 --> 28:23.035
and cheating at racquetball.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.121
I was there, I saw it. Not the sex.

28:25.121 --> 28:27.915
Dude! If that's what you saw,

28:27.915 --> 28:29.542
you weren't there at all.

28:31.836 --> 28:34.171
Are we... Are we having
a real argument right now?

28:34.171 --> 28:35.589
Because this...

28:35.589 --> 28:37.258
This isn't supposed to matter,

28:37.258 --> 28:39.969
this academic circle-jerk-a-thon
we come to every year.

28:39.969 --> 28:42.471
I mean, making fun of these guys

28:42.471 --> 28:45.474
has been one of the foundational pastimes
of our friendship.

28:45.474 --> 28:46.976
No, it's not.

28:46.976 --> 28:49.145
We make fun of them for their haircuts.

28:49.145 --> 28:51.021
We don't make fun of them for caring.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.774
I did, a little.

28:55.985 --> 28:57.319
I see that now.

28:57.445 --> 29:00.489
I don't get why.

29:01.282 --> 29:03.284
You've checked out of academia.

29:03.284 --> 29:05.411
You've checked out of writing.

29:05.411 --> 29:06.829
You've detached yourself

29:06.829 --> 29:10.124
from pretty much
everything you care about.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.877
Every year, you care about less,

29:12.877 --> 29:14.211
and you're more depressed.

29:16.464 --> 29:18.591
I just don't see why.

29:20.426 --> 29:24.096
There's other things
to care about than work.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.389
I got a wife and a kid.

29:25.389 --> 29:27.808
I know that hasn't worked out for you.
I'm sorry,

29:27.808 --> 29:30.060
but it's damn important to me,

29:30.060 --> 29:31.854
so...

29:34.440 --> 29:35.816
Things didn't seem so rosy

29:35.816 --> 29:37.985
the other night at your dinner party.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.338
This is going to be great.

29:57.338 --> 29:59.590
You're acting like
we're on a reality show.

30:01.509 --> 30:03.302
My break ends in ten minutes.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.137
Thank you for sitting down with us.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.555
You're so welcome.

30:06.555 --> 30:09.225
I'm always willing to sit down
and talk things through.

30:09.225 --> 30:12.561
Yeah, for ten minutes.
- I don't make the bar schedule, okay?

30:12.561 --> 30:14.480
Mr. Travis, he makes the bar schedule.

30:14.480 --> 30:18.025
- The point is I've never seen--
- I've told you so many times--

30:18.025 --> 30:19.318
Take a breath!

30:19.318 --> 30:21.946
We can't get anywhere if we're hot-headed.

30:21.946 --> 30:23.572
I agree.

30:23.572 --> 30:27.159
Do you think you can use your calm-down
techniques for every situation?

30:27.159 --> 30:29.703
Is this what you do with Dad?
Because I'm beginning to see your fight

30:29.703 --> 30:30.913
from his point of view.

30:30.913 --> 30:33.749
What fight? We are not having a fight.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.793
Uh, I mean, to be honest, Mrs. D,

30:35.793 --> 30:37.044
from the outside perspective,

30:37.169 --> 30:38.546
it kind of seems like
something's going on.

30:38.546 --> 30:39.755
No, absolutely not.

30:40.047 --> 30:42.091
Then why you are kissing
other men at bars?

30:42.675 --> 30:44.301
What?

30:44.301 --> 30:45.511
I'll tell you about it later.

30:45.511 --> 30:46.887
How do you know--

30:47.680 --> 30:50.057
I'm sorry,
he called me the other day and told me

30:50.057 --> 30:51.684
when he was in that crazy panic.

30:51.684 --> 30:53.060
Who did you kiss?

30:53.060 --> 30:55.688
Okay, look, your father
is experiencing mental anguish

30:55.688 --> 30:59.024
from childhood trauma,
so it actually has nothing to do with me.

30:59.024 --> 31:01.110
Oh, my God, that's, like, very serious.

31:01.318 --> 31:03.612
Is he seeing a psychiatrist?
- No.

31:03.612 --> 31:05.281
- He definitely should be.
- Yeah.

31:05.281 --> 31:07.074
There's this guy
that comes into the bar,

31:07.074 --> 31:08.534
and he's a therapist,

31:08.534 --> 31:12.454
but he sees a psychiatrist,
like, for his own problems, right?

31:12.454 --> 31:14.915
- I can get you his card.
- No, thank you.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.751
Can we stop comparing
whatever this is to my marriage?

31:17.876 --> 31:19.169
- Again--
- That's so unfair.

31:19.169 --> 31:20.588
Mrs. D, I feel like you're the one

31:20.588 --> 31:22.381
who's kind of
not seeing things clearly here.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.925
I support Julie, way more
than Hank supports you.

31:24.925 --> 31:26.719
Oh, really? How so?

31:26.719 --> 31:29.972
I would go to New York
if Julie wanted me to.

31:29.972 --> 31:32.016
- If you asked me to, I would go.
- Really?

31:32.016 --> 31:33.892
Yeah, of course.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.270
- That's very nice. Thank you.
- Of course, I'd go.

31:36.270 --> 31:37.563
So then, why are you
cheating on her, big shot?

31:37.563 --> 31:38.856
- Mom!
- Whoa! I'm not.

31:38.856 --> 31:40.065
Julie thinks otherwise.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.233
- I'm not!
- No, I don't!

31:41.233 --> 31:43.360
- I am so not!
- I know! I believe you!

31:43.360 --> 31:44.653
What?

31:44.653 --> 31:46.280
- I've told her that!
- That's the reason--

31:46.280 --> 31:49.199
Then why aren't you
masturbating as much, huh?

31:49.199 --> 31:50.367
- Whoa! Okay, hang on!
- Tell me that!

31:50.367 --> 31:51.744
- Mom!
- You brought it up!

31:52.077 --> 31:53.329
You can't say that to him!

31:53.329 --> 31:54.413
You brought it up at the house!

31:54.413 --> 31:55.623
- I'm so not!
- I didn't bring that--

31:55.623 --> 31:56.915
Why did you bring that up to her?

31:56.915 --> 31:58.042
You're masturbating the same amount.

31:58.042 --> 31:59.126
Why would I ever bring that up?

31:59.126 --> 32:00.377
You are a traitor!

32:00.377 --> 32:01.712
You need therapy, too!

32:01.712 --> 32:03.130
For real, you need help.

32:03.297 --> 32:04.506
You do need therapy.

32:04.506 --> 32:05.883
Couples counseling! Yes!

32:05.883 --> 32:08.594
You guys deserve each other.
I think this went beautifully.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.137
Sit down, let's keep talking about that.

32:10.137 --> 32:12.931
We managed to do that
with eight minutes to spare!

32:12.931 --> 32:14.224
- Good luck.
- Where are you going?

32:14.224 --> 32:15.976
- Don't leave.
- You drove me here!

32:20.064 --> 32:21.065
I would go to New York with you.

32:21.065 --> 32:22.816
- Would you really?
- Yeah, of course.

32:44.088 --> 32:45.214
Give me a moment.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.966
If I'm there more than 30 seconds,

32:47.966 --> 32:50.469
then just say we're due somewhere.

32:51.887 --> 32:53.555
Hank.

32:53.555 --> 32:57.351
Thank you for briefly
stopping by my panel.

32:57.351 --> 32:59.144
For a moment, I thought
you were there to heckle.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.312
Heckle?

33:01.855 --> 33:02.898
I'm sorry.

33:02.898 --> 33:04.983
- Uh...
- What?

33:07.611 --> 33:08.946
Well, the turnout, you know.

33:08.946 --> 33:10.406
- I mean--
- Oh.

33:10.406 --> 33:12.574
...it's tough when the panelists
outnumber the audience.

33:12.574 --> 33:14.535
- We've all been there.
- No, not at all.

33:15.869 --> 33:16.912
We ran with it,

33:16.912 --> 33:19.248
and we turned the event into a workshop.

33:19.748 --> 33:21.083
It was...

33:21.250 --> 33:24.420
It was the most invigorating
conversation I've had in a long time.

33:24.420 --> 33:28.298
I don't know if I'm just
coming into my own,

33:28.298 --> 33:30.551
or the world is catching up to me,

33:30.551 --> 33:32.302
but I want to wear a T-shirt

33:32.302 --> 33:35.222
that says, "I've been...

33:35.222 --> 33:36.557
"here

33:36.557 --> 33:38.809
"the whole time!"

33:38.934 --> 33:41.270
Maybe I'd use a different meter.
Yoo-hoo.

33:43.856 --> 33:45.190
See you back at the playground.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.608
Congrats on <i>The Atlantic.</i>

34:00.706 --> 34:03.375
<i>♪ I'm a-walking down ♪</i>

34:03.375 --> 34:07.463
<i>♪ That lonely road ♪</i>

34:07.463 --> 34:10.632
<i>♪ It's so windy ♪</i>

34:11.049 --> 34:14.470
<i>♪ So chilly and cold ♪</i>

34:22.311 --> 34:26.482
So, how did it go?

34:26.482 --> 34:27.900
Is Julie still here?

34:27.900 --> 34:29.610
They have got issues.

34:29.610 --> 34:31.320
I knew that, but did she go home?

34:31.320 --> 34:33.322
She's not here, is she?

34:34.448 --> 34:35.783
You know what?

34:35.783 --> 34:38.786
It's their marriage, and it has nothing
to do with ours.

34:38.786 --> 34:41.330
- Who said it did?
- Nobody,

34:41.330 --> 34:43.749
and I just think

34:44.875 --> 34:47.377
that I'm going to stay out of it.

34:47.836 --> 34:49.004
I think this generation,

34:49.004 --> 34:50.839
they don't...

34:53.091 --> 34:55.010
They see marriage like it's this game

34:55.010 --> 34:58.096
where you just say anything
and you do whatever you want,

34:58.096 --> 35:00.557
and you're really super "over share-y"

35:00.557 --> 35:03.227
about every single stupid feeling,

35:03.227 --> 35:04.686
and all of that

35:04.686 --> 35:06.021
is just supposed to, like,

35:06.021 --> 35:08.565
fit together into a relationship.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.819
I don't know what I'm saying,

35:11.819 --> 35:15.197
except that thank God,
that's not our marriage.

35:16.281 --> 35:19.076
Yeah, okay.

35:19.076 --> 35:21.745
Do you know what I mean?

35:21.745 --> 35:23.121
Yeah.

35:32.548 --> 35:36.260
You ever feel like
you're right next to your life?

35:36.969 --> 35:38.136
I feel like

35:38.136 --> 35:40.138
I'm watching this guy who looks like me,

35:40.138 --> 35:41.765
and he's doing all this stuff,

35:41.765 --> 35:44.768
and I just want to tap him
on the shoulder and say,

35:44.768 --> 35:47.104
"What's your problem?"

35:49.523 --> 35:50.941
I think I want back in.

35:54.194 --> 35:56.947
Respect.

35:58.448 --> 36:00.325
All right, well,

36:00.325 --> 36:01.952
you want to start with New York?

36:02.661 --> 36:04.288
Absolutely.

36:04.288 --> 36:05.414
Okay, great.

36:05.414 --> 36:07.875
Um, I've asked for a four-day week.

36:07.875 --> 36:11.128
As for the living arrangements,

36:11.128 --> 36:13.130
I found a couple of places

36:13.130 --> 36:15.257
that I think are pretty cute, and--

36:15.257 --> 36:17.509
I need to see my dad.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.261
What?

36:19.261 --> 36:20.470
I'm sorry.

36:20.470 --> 36:22.472
I know you were talking,
and I want to hear it,

36:22.472 --> 36:24.725
but I think I need to see my dad
before he leaves.

36:24.725 --> 36:26.018
Eh... I don't know.

36:26.018 --> 36:27.561
I'm going to go.

37:35.337 --> 37:36.546
Oh.

37:36.546 --> 37:37.965
It's good to see you.

37:39.383 --> 37:40.801
How's retirement?

37:40.801 --> 37:42.135
Oh, well,

37:42.135 --> 37:44.346
it's very new for your father, of course,

37:44.346 --> 37:45.472
and I would say

37:45.472 --> 37:47.975
that an academic never truly retires.

37:48.850 --> 37:51.770
Mom, could I just
talk to Dad alone, please?

37:52.062 --> 37:54.356
Where exactly am I supposed to go?

38:00.529 --> 38:02.114
I'll make some tea.

38:13.875 --> 38:14.960
How...

38:14.960 --> 38:17.087
How is your research coming along?

38:17.087 --> 38:18.171
No.

38:20.465 --> 38:21.550
You tell me

38:21.550 --> 38:23.760
what was behind your decision
to move here?

38:23.760 --> 38:25.262
Oh.

38:25.262 --> 38:27.347
Well, I recently retired.

38:27.347 --> 38:29.307
The city no longer felt essential.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.435
Okay, but why here?

38:31.435 --> 38:33.520
I have family here.

38:33.520 --> 38:37.232
We haven't spoken in person
in almost 25 years.

38:37.232 --> 38:40.485
Can we just cut the bullshit
and talk like two adults?

38:40.485 --> 38:42.362
Would you be willing to do that?

38:42.946 --> 38:44.823
I am willing.

38:46.450 --> 38:47.909
Well...

38:47.909 --> 38:50.120
I...

38:50.120 --> 38:53.040
I'm feeling a lot of stuff right now.

38:55.625 --> 38:59.421
I've gone over this conversation

38:59.880 --> 39:02.299
for years in my head,

39:02.299 --> 39:04.926
but I don't really know where to start.

39:05.385 --> 39:07.137
Start in the middle.

39:10.057 --> 39:13.101
I think I might begin by telling you

39:13.101 --> 39:15.312
how hard it was for me

39:15.312 --> 39:18.315
to grow up without a father.

39:19.483 --> 39:22.319
What happened to him?

39:22.319 --> 39:26.573
I'm talking about you leaving your family.

39:26.573 --> 39:29.868
When I left, I got a job at Columbia.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.828
After a string of fellowships,

39:31.828 --> 39:35.957
I had the opportunity
to stay at one institution

39:35.957 --> 39:38.043
and focus on my research.

39:38.043 --> 39:39.753
It was too good to pass up.

39:39.753 --> 39:41.546
I don't give a shit about the job.

39:41.546 --> 39:42.923
I know it was impressive,

39:42.923 --> 39:45.592
but you left mom and me for another woman.

39:47.010 --> 39:49.137
Oh, yes. Well, that was a difficult time--

39:49.137 --> 39:51.723
Difficult? Was it difficult for you?

39:51.723 --> 39:54.476
I'm not being glib here,

39:54.476 --> 39:56.103
I actually want to know.

39:56.103 --> 39:59.106
How exactly was it difficult for you

39:59.106 --> 40:01.775
when you saw a child on the floor

40:01.775 --> 40:03.777
with a rope around his neck. your son

40:05.487 --> 40:08.490
how did that impact you?

40:08.490 --> 40:10.867
And why was the answer to that

40:10.867 --> 40:13.370
to cut off all contact with your son?

40:15.997 --> 40:18.667
Oh, you're talking about Hank?

40:19.876 --> 40:22.295
He was a stubborn child.

40:22.295 --> 40:24.339
Strong-willed, demanding.

40:27.259 --> 40:30.428
He won't actually speak to me now.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.223
Did you know that?

40:33.223 --> 40:35.600
I'm talking to you right now.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.061
Yes, you are.

40:39.354 --> 40:41.982
Milk, two sugars, right?

40:52.325 --> 40:53.743
Dad, how did you get to town?

40:53.743 --> 40:55.871
Did you come by car or train?

40:58.832 --> 41:00.667
Either way, I arrived.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.753
What day of the week is it?

41:03.753 --> 41:07.090
Oh, my God, we both need a new calendar.

41:10.093 --> 41:13.305
How do you like living in Florida?

41:15.098 --> 41:17.309
<i>It's quite pleasant
here in the winter,</i>

41:17.309 --> 41:18.977
<i>but...</i>

41:19.352 --> 41:20.937
<i>I'll tell you,</i>

41:20.937 --> 41:22.731
<i>summertime,</i>

41:22.731 --> 41:25.650
<i>the humidity is terrible for books.</i>

41:28.945 --> 41:32.199
<i>Who's the current president?</i>

41:32.199 --> 41:35.577
<i>Can we not talk
about politics tonight?</i>

41:42.709 --> 41:46.171
What do you want to talk about?

41:46.171 --> 41:48.840
Well, I have
a new book coming out,

41:48.840 --> 41:50.800
and the publishers want me to tour

41:50.800 --> 41:53.887
up and down the East Coast.

41:53.887 --> 41:56.973
I'm awaiting approval
from the college, of course,

41:56.973 --> 42:00.101
and we might have to delay it

42:00.101 --> 42:03.021
until my sabbatical comes up.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.610
I wish you luck with that.

42:08.610 --> 42:09.694
Thank you.

42:09.694 --> 42:12.364
Thank you. I hope it all works out,

42:12.364 --> 42:15.283
but how are things going for you?
