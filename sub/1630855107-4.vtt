14:17.565 --> 14:18.732
They called yet?

14:19.942 --> 14:20.776
Has who called?

14:20.776 --> 14:24.154
The Three, Johnny!
The reason I left in the first place.

14:25.322 --> 14:27.616
You know how these warlords are.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.243
Never want to make the first move.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.414
[suspenseful music playing]

14:38.669 --> 14:39.753
Where,

14:40.629 --> 14:41.630
pray tell,

14:41.630 --> 14:42.631
is my prisoner?

14:42.631 --> 14:47.219
Well, Dr. Singh requested that
his wife be transferred to new quarters,

14:47.219 --> 14:50.389
which didn't seem like a huge deal,
'cause we had a couple rooms free.

14:50.389 --> 14:53.225
And you should probably know
there was a minor security breach.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.935
Nothing serious, though.

14:54.935 --> 14:57.062
Someone tried to sneak in,
but I handled it.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.356
Oh.

15:21.503 --> 15:22.504
Why

15:23.923 --> 15:27.051
do you always make me regret trusting you?

15:28.677 --> 15:29.678
Sorry, General.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.764
[suspenseful music intensifies]

15:38.687 --> 15:40.689
[kids clamoring]

15:44.985 --> 15:46.111
[kid] We can't just leave.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.367
[Earl] Why? Do you see anything?

15:55.120 --> 15:57.122
[restrained, pensive music playing]

16:05.089 --> 16:07.091
[thunder rumbling]

16:10.386 --> 16:13.138
[Dolly] Our operation's grown
since last we spoke.

16:13.138 --> 16:16.183
Medicine, scrap, antiques.

16:16.725 --> 16:18.519
Someone's buying it, we'll fly it.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.562
But hauling hybrids is good.

16:20.562 --> 16:21.772
[Aimee] Hmm.

16:21.772 --> 16:24.984
Even the Doomsday strain coming in
from the coast hasn't slowed us down.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.236
"Disaster economics," we call it.

16:27.236 --> 16:30.906
Yeah. The worse it gets out there,
the better for business, you know?

16:30.906 --> 16:34.952
Maybe not for you, Big Man, losing
your contracts and endorsements and stuff.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.955
- It's kind of a raw deal--
- Don't call me "Big Man."

16:40.332 --> 16:41.208
Hey.

16:41.709 --> 16:45.379
As long as they get what they want,
we get what we want, right?

16:45.379 --> 16:47.214
And just be cool.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.924
[Air Lord 1] Hey, easy! No!

16:52.720 --> 16:53.762
I'm being cool.

16:55.222 --> 16:58.225
[Aimee] As far as we know,
our kids are in the old pump room,

16:58.225 --> 17:01.395
but the Last Men have fortified
every entrance and exit

17:01.395 --> 17:05.024
and posted guards here, here and here.

17:05.024 --> 17:09.153
We burned our chance from entering
from underground after our last attempt.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.612
They've increased security.

17:10.612 --> 17:13.157
As you can see,
options on the ground are limited.

17:13.157 --> 17:16.326
- So basically, you're screwed.
- I can do this job by myself.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.203
Fly in and drop a piano on Abbot.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.706
Not the Steinway.
We just found a buyer for that.

17:20.706 --> 17:23.709
- Oh.
- We could napalm the place though.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.170
Oh wait, that's right.
We're out of napalm.

17:26.170 --> 17:29.840
Seems like lot of trouble to go through
for mangy half-breeds, don't it?

17:30.716 --> 17:32.342
They all taste like chicken anyway.

17:32.342 --> 17:35.679
Yeah, dip that son of a bitch
in batter and you fry it up!

17:35.679 --> 17:37.389
- [laughter]
- With a side of collard greens!

17:37.389 --> 17:39.183
[Air Lord 2] Collard greens!

17:39.183 --> 17:40.350
[tense music swells]

17:40.350 --> 17:41.769
Can the shit talk!

17:41.769 --> 17:43.729
[laughter stops abruptly]

17:43.729 --> 17:45.773
Oh, well, excuse me very much.

17:47.483 --> 17:50.778
I didn't realize that the Skull Crusher
was such a bleeding heart.

17:50.778 --> 17:53.739
Maybe you don't know me
as well as you think you do.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.282
[Rufus] I know who you were.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.911
I just stopped caring when you choked.

18:00.370 --> 18:01.789
Everybody, take five.

18:02.873 --> 18:03.791
Mm-hmm.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.220
[Dolly] Sorry about that.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.055
They talk too damn much.

18:22.684 --> 18:23.894
Let's get back to work.

18:23.894 --> 18:24.978
[kids clamoring]

18:29.900 --> 18:31.235
Hi, Gus.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.028
Hi, Bobby.

18:35.030 --> 18:37.282
[Bobby huffing]

18:37.282 --> 18:39.243
Hup! Ahh.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.537
Ah.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.331
- Dog. Dog.
- Do you wanna hold him?

18:44.331 --> 18:45.999
Yeah. Yeah.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.085
Dog.

18:49.711 --> 18:50.712
[coos happily]

18:53.882 --> 18:55.384
Yes, Dog...

18:56.677 --> 18:57.845
[Bobby grouses]

19:00.514 --> 19:02.766
Be careful with that, Bobby.
That isn't a toy!

19:02.766 --> 19:04.393
- [leather snaps]
- [Bobby grunts]

19:06.103 --> 19:07.646
Bobby, how'd you do...

19:08.313 --> 19:09.189
You're brilliant.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.441
Bobby trust Gus.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.318
[wondrous music playing]

19:13.318 --> 19:14.778
[Bobby sniffing]

19:14.778 --> 19:15.946
[questioningly] Oh?

19:16.947 --> 19:18.323
Gus trust Bobby?

19:18.824 --> 19:20.450
[plucky music playing]

19:20.450 --> 19:23.704
[Bobby] Up. Up. Up, up, up. Up. Up.

19:23.704 --> 19:24.788
[Bobby straining]

19:33.297 --> 19:35.757
Bobby, what are... what are you doing?

19:35.757 --> 19:38.343
- Bobby!
- Bobby go find help.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.761
Bobby, wait!

19:41.763 --> 19:43.640
What did you say to him? Where's he going?

19:43.640 --> 19:45.058
I think to find Jepp and your mom.

19:45.058 --> 19:47.060
You shouldn't have let him go.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.437
What if he gets hurt?

19:50.355 --> 19:51.773
If anything happens to him...

19:51.773 --> 19:54.276
[restrained, melancholy music playing]

19:54.276 --> 19:55.360
I just...

20:00.157 --> 20:00.991
You were right.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.327
Right about what?

20:04.953 --> 20:06.788
I shouldn't have lied about Roy.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.457
It only made things worse.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.500
[melancholy music continuing]

20:10.500 --> 20:12.961
Just keep an eye out for Bobby.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.761
[muffled, suspenseful music playing]

20:23.055 --> 20:24.056
[gasps]

20:28.143 --> 20:29.144
[Johnny] Hey, Rani.

20:29.978 --> 20:30.979
There you are.

20:35.192 --> 20:36.193
Everything okay?

20:39.196 --> 20:41.073
Good days and bad.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.407
You know how it is.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.035
Yeah.

20:45.577 --> 20:46.620
Listen, um...

20:47.746 --> 20:51.792
Just got to let you know that you can't
walk around without an escort anymore,

20:52.793 --> 20:54.127
now that my brother...

20:54.670 --> 20:56.755
Sorry, the General is back.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.592
He, um, wouldn't like it very much.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.763
He's your brother?

21:06.890 --> 21:08.016
Well, yeah.

21:08.684 --> 21:09.518
Guilty as charged.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.939
People can get weird when they find out.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.525
Can't imagine why.

21:17.859 --> 21:18.860
Yeah.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.362
Anyway.

21:20.862 --> 21:23.365
Sorry, but I gotta
walk you back to your room.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.625
I've seen how he treats you.

21:34.209 --> 21:35.544
Why do you put up with it?

21:35.544 --> 21:38.005
He's a monster.
You've seen what he's done.

21:38.005 --> 21:41.466
He's got those poor things locked up.
Why don't you just walk away?

21:43.510 --> 21:44.886
He's all that I got.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.767
Family's in short supply.

21:52.102 --> 21:53.103
[thunder rumbling]

22:04.656 --> 22:06.366
[chickens clucking]

22:30.849 --> 22:33.935
Do you understand
what's happening out there, Doctor?

22:35.103 --> 22:37.564
There's a war outside these walls.

22:37.564 --> 22:40.192
We are fighting extinction
and we are losing.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.402
So if you don't mind me asking,

22:43.278 --> 22:47.115
why in the name of God
are you starting a chicken farm?

22:47.699 --> 22:50.535
[haltingly] The chickens are the answer.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.123
- Excuse me?
- These chickens are from Fort Smith.

22:55.123 --> 22:58.168
Some generations removed
from a genetically modified stock,

22:58.168 --> 23:01.338
produced at Project Midnight Sun.

23:01.338 --> 23:03.256
- Get to the point.
- Yes.

23:04.091 --> 23:08.553
Specifically, they can produce antibodies

23:08.553 --> 23:11.640
that fight the H5G9 virus.

23:12.849 --> 23:18.105
But... But... But their antibodies were
incompatible with human physiology,

23:18.105 --> 23:23.485
but I found something that
those antibodies are compatible with.

23:23.485 --> 23:26.279
Dr. Bell's Secret Sauce.

23:26.279 --> 23:28.240
You see, on its own,

23:28.240 --> 23:32.661
the treatment simply forces
the virus into a state of dormancy.

23:32.661 --> 23:35.205
- Which is why it always returned.
- Quite right.

23:35.205 --> 23:37.416
- But... But when I combined it...
- [centrifuge beeps]

23:38.083 --> 23:40.043
...with the antibodies from the chickens,

23:41.628 --> 23:44.339
the treatment didn't
merely negate the virus.

23:46.758 --> 23:47.759
[sighs]

23:56.893 --> 23:57.978
It destroyed it.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.690
[wondrous music playing]

24:07.112 --> 24:08.280
A cure?

24:10.699 --> 24:11.700
<i>The</i> cure.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.122
How many more of these do you have?

24:17.706 --> 24:19.666
This is the first. But we'll need more...

24:19.666 --> 24:21.751
[chilling music playing]

24:23.086 --> 24:24.671
Don't you look at me like that.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.465
[wheezy laughter]

24:29.468 --> 24:31.761
I'll give you back your cure. I promise.

24:32.888 --> 24:36.349
But I can't have you
saving your little bird just yet.

24:38.268 --> 24:41.021
Do you know what great men do

24:41.021 --> 24:46.401
when somehow, miraculously,
they've managed to save the world?

24:47.819 --> 24:48.653
They celebrate.

24:49.946 --> 24:54.284
You, me, dinner this evening,

24:54.826 --> 24:56.745
and you'll bring your lovely wife.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.916
Don't worry, Doc,
there won't be chicken on the menu.

25:03.710 --> 25:07.088
In my experience, the Last Men
aren't very tactically minded.

25:07.088 --> 25:08.757
More backyard militia types.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.634
It's a safe bet they'll redirect

25:10.634 --> 25:13.220
most of their resources
out to the checkpoints

25:13.220 --> 25:14.429
once the alert goes out.

25:14.429 --> 25:16.765
Lucky for us,
most of them can't shoot for shit.

25:17.474 --> 25:19.559
But we can. Isn't that right, boys?

25:19.559 --> 25:20.936
- Oh yeah.
- Yes, ma'am.

25:20.936 --> 25:23.563
If we can pull
at least half of them out of there,

25:24.439 --> 25:26.483
I feel good about our chances.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.318
Then we just need to secure the payload...

25:29.486 --> 25:32.113
Uh, children.

25:32.113 --> 25:33.448
Children.

25:33.448 --> 25:35.492
And <i>vámonos</i> before anyone's the wiser.

25:35.492 --> 25:38.453
So you're telling me
that to pull this off,

25:38.453 --> 25:41.665
we're gonna fly our whole fleet,
including Big Bertha,

25:42.165 --> 25:46.711
with full freight,
not to mention Gigantor over here.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.046
[man] What's the problem?

25:48.046 --> 25:51.466
We don't have enough fuel.
Ain't no way we're making it to Essex.

25:51.466 --> 25:54.177
What? We just pulled
that barrel swap with Zhang last week.

25:54.177 --> 25:56.930
No, he is right.
We sprung a leak on our last rum run.

25:56.930 --> 25:59.891
- We lost half a tank.
- What about the depot outside Lemire City?

25:59.891 --> 26:03.562
- Hasn't it been out of commission?
- [Jepp] No, it's not. I've seen it.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.146
It's pretty lightly guarded.

26:05.146 --> 26:08.400
We could steal what we want
and go straight to the zoo.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.026
Great! Yeah!

26:10.026 --> 26:14.239
And the sooner we reunite
these, uh, lovebirds with their freaks,

26:14.239 --> 26:16.366
the sooner I can get me that tank.

26:16.366 --> 26:17.409
[chuckles]

26:18.618 --> 26:20.954
You're gonna apologize
to the lady this time.

26:20.954 --> 26:22.872
- And you're gonna do it now.
- Jepp.

26:22.872 --> 26:24.416
Don't make me tell you again.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.252
What happened to you, man?

26:27.836 --> 26:29.504
Jepperd, don't.

26:29.504 --> 26:31.172
[Rufus] You used to be a god.

26:31.965 --> 26:35.302
Right? But then you come
limping in here with some zookeeper,

26:35.302 --> 26:36.511
begging us for help.

26:37.053 --> 26:39.389
Well, welcome to the cheap seats, Big Man.

26:40.557 --> 26:41.600
- Whoa!
- [Air Lord 2] Hey!

26:41.600 --> 26:42.767
Lay off!

26:42.767 --> 26:44.936
- [Aimee] Okay, stop now.
- Now, huh? Keep talking!

26:45.895 --> 26:47.147
[gunshot echoes]

26:50.442 --> 26:52.485
You need to step outside.

27:18.053 --> 27:20.847
- [bold, intense music playing]
- [grunts]

27:20.847 --> 27:24.392
- [instructor 1] Soldier, keep going!
- [instructor 2] Let's go!

27:24.392 --> 27:26.394
That's what I'm talking about!

27:27.187 --> 27:29.397
Now you're looking like soldiers! Move!

27:30.690 --> 27:32.484
Faster! Faster!

27:34.027 --> 27:35.111
That's it, soldier!

27:35.612 --> 27:36.863
I want more!

27:36.863 --> 27:38.615
I don't care if you're tired!

27:38.615 --> 27:42.410
[instructor 1] Come on, soldiers!
Run for cover, big boy, hurry up!

27:42.410 --> 27:45.121
You want to go to war, you must be broken!

27:45.705 --> 27:47.749
Come on! You're letting a girl beat you!

27:48.416 --> 27:50.085
We're the Last Men!

27:50.085 --> 27:51.419
[music trails off]

27:51.419 --> 27:52.504
[all panting]

27:56.299 --> 27:58.468
You're really showing us up.

27:59.719 --> 28:00.720
[officer] <i>Ready.</i>

28:01.763 --> 28:02.889
Aim.

28:03.390 --> 28:04.265
Fire!

28:05.141 --> 28:07.477
Again. Like you mean it!

28:07.477 --> 28:11.022
Ready, aim, fire!

28:12.482 --> 28:14.776
What's the matter? Feeling sympathetic?

28:15.944 --> 28:16.861
No, sir.

28:16.861 --> 28:20.323
You see one of them out in the field,
are you gonna go soft on me, recruit?

28:20.323 --> 28:22.325
No, sir! Not me, sir.

28:22.909 --> 28:24.828
Then what are you waiting for?

28:33.878 --> 28:35.046
Not bad.

28:38.091 --> 28:39.843
Again. Ready.

28:40.635 --> 28:41.678
Aim.

28:42.178 --> 28:43.096
Fire!

28:43.096 --> 28:44.472
[bolts whistling]

28:59.529 --> 29:01.740
Where exactly
did you learn to shoot like that?

29:03.700 --> 29:04.993
I taught myself, sir.

29:06.661 --> 29:08.997
My parents caught the Sick
when I was little.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.207
After that, I was on my own.

29:12.333 --> 29:15.253
I knew if I wanted to live,
it was either fight or die.

29:17.255 --> 29:18.548
I didn't want to die.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.220
Oh, you're a fighter.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.683
And with a little polish,
you're gonna make a fine soldier.

29:30.226 --> 29:31.644
Your parents would be proud.

29:31.644 --> 29:33.354
[delicate, pensive music playing]

29:34.522 --> 29:37.776
Everyone, get yourselves cleaned up
and grab some grub.

29:38.860 --> 29:39.986
You've all earned it.

29:45.825 --> 29:46.910
[Dr. Singh] Rani?

29:52.999 --> 29:54.042
Rani, you all right?

29:55.293 --> 29:56.169
I'm fine.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.547
Why are you still in bed?

30:00.924 --> 30:02.592
I'm just looking at the stars.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.688
I said I'm fine, Adi.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.950
I know this whole ordeal
hasn't been easy on you.

30:28.451 --> 30:31.037
The last nine years,
or as Abbot's prisoner?

30:34.958 --> 30:36.376
Speaking of our host...

30:38.920 --> 30:40.505
he's invited us for dinner.

30:41.089 --> 30:42.131
I know.

30:42.131 --> 30:44.300
He left some clean clothes for you.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.428
Although I do say they're rather horrible.

30:47.428 --> 30:48.429
[Rani grunts]

30:52.183 --> 30:53.476
Hmm.

30:53.476 --> 30:54.686
So how's about it?

30:55.311 --> 30:56.980
Do you fancy an evening out?

30:56.980 --> 30:59.190
I don't think skipping is an option.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.068
It's a celebration, Rani.

31:03.319 --> 31:04.320
We did it.

31:04.821 --> 31:05.655
I did it.

31:06.447 --> 31:10.243
After nine long years, this is it.

31:10.243 --> 31:13.496
You are this close to the first dose.

31:14.414 --> 31:15.331
[relieved sigh]

31:15.331 --> 31:20.169
We are this close to changing everything.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.801
And all because you believed in me.

31:30.471 --> 31:33.224
That's all it takes for Abbot
to show us some basic decency?

31:33.224 --> 31:35.018
Ah, he's a brute, yes,

31:35.560 --> 31:39.898
and a bit of a narcissist,
but he respects what I've done.

31:41.316 --> 31:45.737
So if I have to humor his vanity
a little longer to help him remember that,

31:46.237 --> 31:47.071
so be it.

31:58.499 --> 32:00.960
"A little longer"
keeps getting a little longer, Adi.

32:00.960 --> 32:03.755
Oh, I know. But in the meantime, look...

32:08.426 --> 32:10.094
Let's try and enjoy our dinner.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.095
Yeah?

32:12.597 --> 32:15.850
Even if it is
with the bearded nut job. Hey, hey, hey.

32:17.101 --> 32:18.645
If it all gets too much,

32:19.562 --> 32:21.022
just say the word "gargoyle."

32:22.774 --> 32:24.525
And I'll get you out of there.

32:24.525 --> 32:26.611
[gentle, melancholy music playing]

32:30.365 --> 32:31.532
Gargoyle.

32:32.742 --> 32:36.329
[discomforting music builds]

32:36.329 --> 32:38.498
[elegant opera music playing in distance]

32:42.502 --> 32:47.966
Aha, the man of the hour,
and his little bird.

32:47.966 --> 32:53.471
Doctor, Rani, thanks so much
for accepting my humble invitation.

32:53.471 --> 32:54.597
Do come down.

33:05.608 --> 33:06.526
[Abbot] Oh!

33:07.110 --> 33:10.488
Doctor, don't look so dour.
This is a celebration. Step this way.

33:11.864 --> 33:13.074
This is just my face.

33:14.492 --> 33:15.451
Do I look dour?

33:18.997 --> 33:20.289
[Abbot] Grab a seat.

33:24.669 --> 33:25.670
[Abbot clears throat]

33:26.170 --> 33:29.090
So they tell me you have new lodgings.

33:29.090 --> 33:30.008
You liking it?

33:30.008 --> 33:32.427
It's no aviary, but I'm managing.

33:33.219 --> 33:34.137
[thunder rumbling]

33:37.140 --> 33:39.517
You will let us know if you need anything?

33:40.101 --> 33:42.395
Ah! Dudley with the bubbly.

33:43.229 --> 33:44.897
Bubbly Dudley. [laughs]

33:44.897 --> 33:46.482
Dudley Bubbly.

33:47.567 --> 33:48.568
Excellent.

33:50.361 --> 33:51.988
What's on the menu, Dudley?

33:51.988 --> 33:55.324
For starters, we're having
a three-bean salad with an artichoke,

33:55.324 --> 33:58.202
and for the main, we're having
lasagna made with real cheese.

33:58.202 --> 34:00.872
Good God, Dudley,
where did we dig up that menu?

34:01.789 --> 34:03.166
I... I thought--

34:03.166 --> 34:05.793
I may have made a suggestion or two.

34:05.793 --> 34:08.838
She used to be a chef,
you know, before everything.

34:09.338 --> 34:11.382
[Abbot] Ah. How thoughtful.

34:11.883 --> 34:12.759
[cork pops]

34:12.759 --> 34:14.552
Good thing we didn't
have you in the kitchen.

34:14.552 --> 34:17.305
You could've whipped it up yourself.
[wheezy laughter]

34:17.305 --> 34:19.015
- Mmm.
- I told you before, she's--

34:19.015 --> 34:21.642
Yeah, I know she's not contagious, no.

34:22.477 --> 34:24.353
Nor is my sense of humor.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.065
Johnny!

34:27.065 --> 34:29.192
What's up? We're about to have dinner.

34:29.192 --> 34:31.110
I invited him to join us, actually.

34:32.695 --> 34:36.574
Everybody's been so busy, I thought
we could all finally sit down together.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.076
After all,

34:38.910 --> 34:40.536
so nice to eat with family.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.628
Oh, really?

34:49.462 --> 34:50.713
- You're, uh--
- Indeed.

34:51.839 --> 34:53.341
By all means, Johnny.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.051
Pull up a chair.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.135
Dudley!

34:59.097 --> 35:03.601
Wow, I didn't know
my brother was such a sociable fella.

35:04.852 --> 35:08.356
I hope he didn't confess
all the family secrets.

35:08.981 --> 35:11.651
And what secrets
might there be to confess?

35:18.491 --> 35:20.451
A toast. Shall we?

35:23.287 --> 35:24.288
[Rani clears throat]

35:26.207 --> 35:28.334
[Abbot] These past nine years have been...

35:31.212 --> 35:32.463
[Rani] Just say when.

35:36.050 --> 35:37.468
[Johnny] Ooh...

35:37.468 --> 35:38.803
Yeah. Thank you.

35:39.762 --> 35:40.763
Sorry.

35:40.763 --> 35:41.931
[Abbot clears throat]

35:45.184 --> 35:46.561
You good?

35:48.104 --> 35:52.775
These past nine years
have been trying on all of us.

35:53.401 --> 35:57.071
We have suffered immensely as a country,

35:57.071 --> 35:59.866
as communities, as a species.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.618
We've lost our faith...

36:04.412 --> 36:07.123
and our trust in our fellow man.

36:07.999 --> 36:13.796
But it is in our nature,
in our destiny, if you will, to persevere.

36:13.796 --> 36:19.760
And it is precisely our destiny
which has led all of us to this evening.

36:21.387 --> 36:27.059
Doctor, your work here will forever
be etched in the pages of history.

36:28.311 --> 36:32.398
Rani, you must be
so proud of your husband.

36:32.398 --> 36:34.984
I hope you know, without you,

36:35.735 --> 36:39.405
his achievement here
could not have been possible.

36:39.405 --> 36:41.991
You've been his muse.

36:43.492 --> 36:44.827
I salute you, Doctor.

36:45.703 --> 36:46.537
To your health.

36:48.331 --> 36:49.540
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

36:49.540 --> 36:50.625
Cheers.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.046
Well...

36:57.089 --> 36:58.549
Let us dine.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.051
[indistinct chatter]

37:11.687 --> 37:13.356
[Aimee] Where did that come from?

37:14.273 --> 37:15.608
That was really stupid.

37:16.651 --> 37:17.652
I know.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.071
- Did I--
- No.

37:20.905 --> 37:23.741
Thankfully, I was able
to talk everybody off the ledge.

37:26.869 --> 37:29.080
You didn't have to do that for me,
you know?

37:31.249 --> 37:32.708
Maybe I did.

37:32.708 --> 37:34.085
I know you're hurting,

37:35.294 --> 37:36.963
and I know you're angry,

37:39.006 --> 37:41.342
but if we're going to work together,

37:42.218 --> 37:45.680
to trust each other,
I need you to talk to me.

37:46.639 --> 37:50.685
There is too much at stake
to let these assholes get under your skin.

37:56.816 --> 37:57.858
It wasn't them.

37:59.318 --> 38:00.319
It...

38:01.862 --> 38:06.993
My wife gave birth to our son
right after the Crumble.

38:07.785 --> 38:09.870
Her name was Louisa.

38:09.870 --> 38:12.331
We never got to name our son before...

38:14.375 --> 38:16.836
before the government took him from me.

38:17.503 --> 38:20.923
I got desperate.
Tracked down an old friend for advice.

38:22.258 --> 38:23.801
He had joined the Last Men

38:23.801 --> 38:26.721
back when they first started
calling themselves that.

38:26.721 --> 38:28.848
He said he had contacts.

38:28.848 --> 38:32.476
Said they could help me
find my family if I joined up too.

38:32.476 --> 38:34.562
[mournful music playing]

38:37.773 --> 38:42.611
When you asked me what I did with them...

38:44.739 --> 38:45.990
I lied to you.

38:51.579 --> 38:54.915
I was one of the guys who rounded up
the kids and brought them in.

38:56.584 --> 38:57.877
And I was good at it.

38:58.461 --> 39:00.588
They called me the "hybrid catcher."

39:06.135 --> 39:10.056
I don't know if I was the one
who took your kids. I'll never know.

39:13.392 --> 39:17.188
But even if it wasn't me,
I know it was someone like me.

39:21.984 --> 39:23.652
And I have to live with that.

39:27.156 --> 39:29.533
Knowing that I tore families apart

39:30.159 --> 39:31.702
so I could get mine back.

39:40.628 --> 39:41.712
I trusted you!

39:42.880 --> 39:44.131
[Aimee wails]

39:44.131 --> 39:45.341
I trusted you!

39:55.351 --> 39:58.020
And did you ever get them back?

39:58.020 --> 40:00.106
[distressing music builds]

40:02.566 --> 40:03.776
[Aimee] Ah.

40:07.446 --> 40:08.697
Thank you for telling me.

40:16.747 --> 40:17.832
[exhales shakily]

40:24.672 --> 40:27.466
Hey. You want to sit with us?

40:28.551 --> 40:31.595
Uh, no, I'm... I'm good here. Thanks.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.435
Those were some savage moves earlier.

40:40.771 --> 40:42.314
Everybody's been talking about it.

40:48.237 --> 40:51.323
Did you really teach yourself all that?

40:54.326 --> 40:55.327
Yeah.

41:04.170 --> 41:09.133
Hey, I know we haven't been friends
for very long, but, you know...

41:11.093 --> 41:13.179
if there's something bothering you...

41:15.598 --> 41:16.474
I'm here.

41:19.351 --> 41:21.228
- I--
- [Lou] Okay, everyone, listen up!

41:22.813 --> 41:25.983
You, and you, and you too.

41:25.983 --> 41:28.486
Saddle up. You got your first mission.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.445
Rolling out in ten.

41:29.445 --> 41:32.239
All right, let's get you guys ready.

41:32.239 --> 41:33.324
Follow me.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.658
[music builds to a climax]

41:35.534 --> 41:37.536
[elegant opera music playing]

41:38.621 --> 41:39.705
[Abbot clears throat]

41:41.207 --> 41:42.666
Who's ready for dessert?

41:44.335 --> 41:45.669
Dudley!

41:47.880 --> 41:48.964
Strawberry milkshakes.

41:49.590 --> 41:51.675
[Abbot] At the request of the good doctor.

41:52.259 --> 41:55.054
I may have made a suggestion as well.

41:56.138 --> 41:56.972
Thank you.

42:01.435 --> 42:02.520
- [Rani] Mmm.
- Um...

42:03.103 --> 42:04.563
- These are...
- Not great.

42:04.563 --> 42:06.315
- No, they're not.
- [Rani] Mm-mmm.

42:06.315 --> 42:09.235
They're, um, made
from military ration powder.

42:09.235 --> 42:11.028
- That's why.
- [scoffs]

42:11.612 --> 42:12.488
[whispers] Sorry.

42:12.488 --> 42:13.781
Hey.

42:15.282 --> 42:16.575
It's the thought that counts.

42:16.575 --> 42:18.953
- [Abbot slurping]
- [Rani chuckles]

42:18.953 --> 42:20.329
Is it?

42:21.455 --> 42:23.457
The thought that counts?

42:24.833 --> 42:28.671
Well, I'm asking because you strike me as

42:28.671 --> 42:33.175
that kind of woman
who's primarily interested in results.

42:34.093 --> 42:40.099
No offense, but I doubt whether
he'd have made it this far without your...

42:41.141 --> 42:42.476
guiding hand.

42:44.603 --> 42:45.479
It's a team effort.

42:46.647 --> 42:48.691
Just as it is with you and Johnny.

42:48.691 --> 42:50.568
[Abbot] You're absolutely right.

42:50.568 --> 42:56.448
After all, who can you trust
in this world but family?

42:58.075 --> 42:59.702
You two make quite the duo.

43:00.244 --> 43:01.245
[Abbot] Yeah, we do.

43:01.954 --> 43:04.248
We're a duo. We... We were a duo.

43:04.248 --> 43:07.126
We had this music outfit
when we were young.

43:07.126 --> 43:11.797
I'd yadda-yadda on the guitar.
But Johnny... Johnny had a voice.

43:12.715 --> 43:16.385
This beautiful, soulful voice.

43:16.385 --> 43:18.596
It'll bring a tear to your eye.

43:19.096 --> 43:21.765
We figured we'd be
like Simon and Garfunkel.

43:21.765 --> 43:25.352
Yeah, we played open mics, talent shows.

43:25.352 --> 43:28.439
I even got him a fake ID
so we could play dive bars.

43:28.439 --> 43:31.442
[Johnny] Do you remember when
that fight broke out in Cedar Mountain?

43:31.442 --> 43:32.943
Oh God.

43:32.943 --> 43:35.195
- The owner didn't want to pay us.

43:35.195 --> 43:36.655
Mom nearly had a breakdown.

43:36.655 --> 43:37.906
[Abbot] Yeah.

43:38.407 --> 43:40.826
Yeah. She sat me down.

43:40.826 --> 43:43.912
She said, "Yeah, one day I'll be gone."

43:43.912 --> 43:45.664
"You'll be all he has."

43:46.999 --> 43:48.334

43:50.085 --> 43:51.086
Which I did.

43:52.421 --> 43:57.051
Yeah, I started working
so he could pursue his passion.

43:58.385 --> 44:01.639
When I joined the military,
I'd send money back every month.

44:03.349 --> 44:06.518
I don't know, it was just important to me

44:07.811 --> 44:10.522
that he doesn't lose that side of him.

44:11.649 --> 44:14.568
Then destiny intervened, and...

44:15.194 --> 44:19.657
one day, the Sick came along.

44:20.532 --> 44:21.617
Ma died.

44:22.242 --> 44:23.786
But I remembered that promise.

44:24.787 --> 44:28.582
I made a vow never to leave John's side.

Ever.

to survive the rigor of this new world.

Ah, goddammit, Dudley, I'll cut you. What?

44:59.279 --> 45:00.531

45:04.410 --> 45:05.411
[Abbot] Ah.

45:10.332 --> 45:11.917

45:12.501 --> 45:13.544
Well, it seems...

45:15.546 --> 45:19.174
destiny has intervened yet again.

45:20.092 --> 45:22.052
So the Group of Three...

45:22.052 --> 45:23.721
[lighter clinks]

45:23.721 --> 45:27.474
...they finally came to their senses,
and they agreed to hear my proposal.

What is that exactly?

45:30.519 --> 45:31.770
[Abbot chuckles]

Just gonna have to wait
till tomorrow to find out.

45:35.274 --> 45:41.238
But I do have my star scientist by my side
and I'm pretty sure they'll see the light.

45:41.822 --> 45:45.451
Tomorrow, we bring
a little order to this chaotic world.

45:46.744 --> 45:47.619

45:48.579 --> 45:50.080

45:56.795 --> 45:57.796
I don't know.

- He's...
- He's...

- ...not so bad.
- [Rani] ...insane.

46:02.676 --> 46:04.261

46:07.139 --> 46:08.849
Were we at the same dinner?

46:08.849 --> 46:13.479
He's a bit theatrical, sure,
but it seems to me he loves his brother,

46:13.479 --> 46:16.148
and will do anything for him,
which is how I feel about you.

46:16.148 --> 46:18.859
So in that way, he and I are--

46:18.859 --> 46:20.444
You two are not the same, Adi.

46:20.444 --> 46:21.987
We're both desperate for a cure,

46:21.987 --> 46:25.908

I doubt I would have found it by now.

with his presentation tomorrow?

46:34.291 --> 46:35.209
I have to.

Besides, what Abbot said about destiny...

it was our destiny to end up here?
