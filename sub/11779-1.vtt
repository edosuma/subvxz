05:47.889 --> 05:51.934

{\an8}- A LOT OF THE GREAT TATTOOERS
IN THE INDUSTRY

05:55.396 --> 05:58.274
{\an8}HAVE BASED THEIR CAREERS
ON BEING IN CONVENTION HALLS.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.777
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS
THAT YOU HAVE TO DO

06:00.860 --> 06:02.695
TO STAY RELEVANT
IN THE BUSINESS.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.155
- ALL RIGHT, HOW YOU DOING?
I'M RUCK.

06:04.238 --> 06:05.907

06:09.035 --> 06:11.746
- YEAH, WITH NO REFERENCE.
THAT'S FUN.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.289
[laughs]
- CONVENTION STYLE.

06:13.372 --> 06:15.208
- YEAH, WHAT'S UP?

06:15.291 --> 06:17.126
- PRESSURE IN A CONVENTION
IS HUGE.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.087
YOU HAVE MASS CROWDS,
YOU HAVE NOISE.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.421
THERE ARE NO AMENITIES.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.464
- YOU HAVE TO KIND OF BOOTLEG
AN ARMREST.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.175
- YOU'RE COMPLETELY OUT
OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE,

06:24.258 --> 06:25.802
SO THE PRESSURE'S ON.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.220
- AND, LIKE,
ON THE LETTERING AND [bleep],

06:27.303 --> 06:28.805
I'M GONNA DO, LIKE,
A DROP SHADOW BEHIND IT.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.140
YOU'RE THE FIRST TATTOO, SO I
GOT TO, LIKE, IMPRESS EVERYBODY.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.975
- THE WORST IS
WHEN PEOPLE COME IN

06:33.059 --> 06:35.061
WITH A PICTURE
OF SOMEONE ELSE'S TATTOO.

06:35.144 --> 06:39.524
GET YOUR OWN GODDAMN IDEA,
[bleep] SIMPLETON.

06:39.607 --> 06:40.191

06:40.274 --> 06:42.318
- THANK YOU.

06:42.401 --> 06:43.820
{\an8}- I AM GENTLE JAY BLONDEL.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.948
THE "GENTLE" PART COMES
FROM THE WAY THAT I TATTOO.

06:47.031 --> 06:48.658
IT DOESN'T DESCRIBE
MY PERSONALITY.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.953
I'LL BITE YOUR [bleep] HEAD OFF
TO GET WHAT I WANT.

06:52.036 --> 06:54.539
- IN THE ISLANDS,
TATTOO'S A VERY PERSONAL THING.

06:54.622 --> 06:55.748
IT'S AN EXCHANGE OF ENERGY.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.208
I DON'T TATTOO PEOPLE
I DON'T LIKE.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.544
I'M FROM THE BIG ISLAND
OF HAWAII.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.296
{\an8}I AM PRIMARILY KNOWN
FOR POLYNESIAN TATTOO,

07:02.380 --> 07:04.841
{\an8}AND I HAVE CLIENTS THAT COME
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.134
THIS TITLE'S ALREADY MINE.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.051
IT'S ALMOST AS IF
I'M RELIVING SOMETHING

07:07.135 --> 07:11.013
I ALREADY KNOW HAS HAPPENED.

07:11.097 --> 07:11.848
- IT'S HARD TO GET
THESE GLOVES ON

07:11.931 --> 07:13.391
WHEN YOU'RE SWEATING
LIKE CRAZY.

07:13.474 --> 07:14.892
- YOU GUYS LOOKING TO GET
SOME TATTOOS TODAY, MAN?

07:14.976 --> 07:18.062
- I COULD HAVE SPENT THE WHOLE
SIX HOURS JUST ON ONE TATTOO,

07:18.146 --> 07:20.523
BUT I'M MORE ABOUT QUALITY
THAN QUANTITY.

07:20.606 --> 07:23.860
I'M PRETTY MUCH JUST KNOWN
FOR DOING CLEAN TATTOOS.

07:23.943 --> 07:27.113
I ENJOY NOT HAVING
A SPECIFIC STYLE.

07:27.196 --> 07:29.866
{\an8}I'VE GONE THROUGH JAIL,
DRUG ADDICTION.

07:29.949 --> 07:30.533
PULLED MY LIFE BACK TOGETHER.

07:30.616 --> 07:33.661
I'M GONNA WIN THE COMPETITION.

07:33.744 --> 07:35.288
[bleep] EVERYBODY ELSE.

07:35.371 --> 07:38.249
- SWEATING MY BALLS OFF
IN THIS MOTHER[bleep] ROOM.

07:38.332 --> 07:39.292
- COME ON, NOW.
- [laughs]

07:39.375 --> 07:41.377
THIS COMPETITION CAN BE
AN ANALOGY

07:41.460 --> 07:44.255
FOR EVERY SINGLE DAY
TATTOOING.

07:44.338 --> 07:47.049
{\an8}IF YOU [bleep] UP,
YOU [bleep] UP FOR GOOD.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.051
AND NOW, I'M GONNA GO BACK IN
AND KIND OF DETAIL OUT

07:49.135 --> 07:50.178
SOME OF THIS STUFF TOO.

07:50.261 --> 07:53.389
MY STRATEGY IS JUST
TO FOCUS ON MY OWN ARTWORK,

07:53.472 --> 07:54.765
BECAUSE EVEN THE LOWEST
OF MY ABILITY

07:54.849 --> 07:58.978
WILL BE BETTER THAN THE HIGHEST
OF MOST OTHER PEOPLE HERE.

07:59.061 --> 08:00.479
- A LOT OF THIS STUFF
IS ALL FREEHANDED.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.815
LET ME SEE YOUR ARM REAL QUICK.
JUST HOLD IT UP.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.234
- MY TATTOOS REFLECT
MY PERSONALITY.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.070
I KNOW IT [bleep] HURTS.
BAM!

08:08.154 --> 08:10.239
{\an8}OVERALL, I'M AGGRESSIVE.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.741
I DEFINITELY THINK
THAT MY TATTOOS HAVE

08:11.824 --> 08:14.911
THAT BLOOD AND THUNDER,
THAT GLORY, THAT TOUGH EDGE.

08:14.994 --> 08:15.995
I WANT IT
TO ALMOST LOOK LIKE

08:16.078 --> 08:16.871
IT'S GONNA KICK YOU
IN THE TEETH.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.289
GET IN THERE!

08:18.372 --> 08:19.457
I'M VERY CONFIDENT
THAT I'M GONNA WIN THIS.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.416
THERE IS NO ONE
IN THIS COMPETITION

08:20.499 --> 08:23.377
THAT'S GONNA TAKE THAT WIN
AWAY FROM ME.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.213
- SCOTT'S DOING
AN ENTIRE CHEST PANEL.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.589
{\an8}HE'S ALREADY KNOCKED
TWO OF THESE

08:26.672 --> 08:29.759
{\an8}GIGANTIC [bleep] TATTOOS OUT,
AND I'M LIKE, "[bleep].

08:29.842 --> 08:31.093
{\an8}I MIGHT AS WELL JUST
GO HOME RIGHT NOW."

08:31.177 --> 08:35.765
- YEAH.
OH...YEAH.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.515
- OH, TRY NOT TO TALK
WITH YOUR HANDS.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.808
I DO IT TOO.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

08:38.893 --> 08:41.187
- I CAN'T HAVE IT ON HERE
WHERE IT CURVES.

08:41.270 --> 08:44.106
{\an8}THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM
THAT DOES NOT LIKE BOOBS,

08:44.190 --> 08:45.566
{\an8}AND I GET THE BOOBS.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.110
- IT'S A BAD SIDE OF NOT HAVING
"A" CUPS, BUT YEAH.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.070
[both laughing]

08:49.153 --> 08:51.948
- I SPECIALIZE
IN PAINTERLY STYLE TATTOOS,

08:52.031 --> 08:55.284
BUT I ALSO LIKE TO DUPLICATE,
LIKE, PORTRAITS.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.996
IT'S PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO
COME DOWN AT LEAST THIS FAR.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.748
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
WHY WOULD I BE GETTING A LOCKET

09:00.831 --> 09:01.874
ON MY STOMACH NOW?

09:01.958 --> 09:03.668
- MY CANVAS
IS A PAIN IN THE ASS.

09:03.751 --> 09:07.672
- I'M A LITTLE APPREHENSIVE
ABOUT HAVING IT THAT PROMINENT.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.632
- JUST SHUT UP
AND GET THE TATTOO.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.509
YOU WANTED IT,
YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

09:11.592 --> 09:13.928
YOU'VE PLACED IT.
LET'S DO IT RIGHT NOW.

09:14.011 --> 09:15.972
I NEED TO TATTOO SOMETHING
ON YOU.

09:16.055 --> 09:19.183
IF NOT, THEN THE GAME IS OVER,
AND I'M DONE FOR THE DAY.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.142
I'M [bleep].

09:20.226 --> 09:21.978
- FOUR HOURS REMAINING.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.562
- DID HE SAY FOUR HOURS?

09:23.646 --> 09:26.482
- THE PART ABOUT HAVING
A CONVENTION IS YOU NEVER KNOW

09:26.565 --> 09:28.609
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA BE
WORKING WITH, EVER.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.486
{\an8}TWO YEARS AGO,
I WAS DIAGNOSED

09:30.569 --> 09:32.071
{\an8}WITH TESTICULAR
AND LYMPH CANCER.

09:32.154 --> 09:34.991
THE FIRST THING I ASKED WAS,
"CAN I STILL TATTOO?"

09:35.074 --> 09:37.451
AND THEY SAID, "NO.
YOU CAN'T BE AROUND CLIENTS

09:37.535 --> 09:39.078
AND THEIR OPEN WOUNDS
DURING CHEMOTHERAPY."

09:39.161 --> 09:40.621
AND I SAID, "I WON'T EVEN
GO THROUGH IT."

09:40.705 --> 09:42.832
THE FIRST COMPETITION
WAS CANCER.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.250
I FOUGHT IT, AND I WON.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.210
THIS IS JUST LIKE
ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE BATTLES.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.922
I'M NOT HERE TO [bleep] AROUND,
DUDE, I'M HERE TO WIN.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.508
I SPECIALIZE IN NOTHING,
I DO EVERYTHING,

09:52.591 --> 09:55.469
AND I'M NOT HERE TO LOSE.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.847
- SO I'M GONNA HAVE YOU
PROP YOUR ARM,

09:57.930 --> 09:59.015
AND WE JUST GONNA GO.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.266
- DONE! NEXT ONE!

10:00.349 --> 10:03.436
- HOW MANY TATS YOU DONE TODAY?
- I HAVEN'T BEEN COUNTING.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.646
{\an8}- WE'RE LOOKING FOR THEM TO DO
AS MANY TATTOOS AS THEY CAN,

10:05.730 --> 10:10.026
{\an8}BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT DOING
SEVEN SMALL [bleep] TATTOOS

10:10.109 --> 10:11.944
{\an8}OR ONE REALLY BIG,
NICE TATTOO.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.863
WE ARE LOOKING
FOR STRONG FUNDAMENTALS:

10:13.946 --> 10:15.698
OUTLINE, SHADING, COLOR.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.408
WITHOUT STRONG FUNDAMENTALS,

10:17.491 --> 10:18.909
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A RIGHT
TO START THIS COMPETITION.

10:18.993 --> 10:22.538
- IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO SLAM OUT
SIX REALLY HORRIBLE TATTOOS,

10:22.621 --> 10:25.374
THEN THEY CAN DO THAT.
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE MY CALL.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.376
{\an8}MY STRATEGY
FOR QUALITY VERSUS QUANTITY

10:27.460 --> 10:30.546
{\an8}IS TO DO REALLY NICE,
CLEAN PIECES,

10:30.629 --> 10:33.215
{\an8}TRY TO DO MORE THAN ONE,
BUT NOT OVEREXERT MYSELF

10:33.299 --> 10:34.717
{\an8}TO THE POINT WHERE I DO
CRAPPY TATTOOS.

10:34.800 --> 10:38.721
PEOPLE SEEK ME OUT
FOR MY ATTENTION TO DETAIL.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.223
A LOT OF MY TATTOOS LOOK
LIKE THEY'RE HIGH DEFINITION.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.558
I CAME ON TO THIS COMPETITION
TO WIN,

10:42.641 --> 10:45.561
AND I WILL GET THERE
ANY WAY THAT I HAVE TO.

10:45.644 --> 10:48.064
- ONE HOUR REMAINING.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.484
- SO CLOSE.
I CAN FEEL VICTORY.

10:53.611 --> 10:54.945
- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE
THE LAST ONE?

10:55.029 --> 10:55.780
- LET'S PARTY. LET'S PARTY.
- COOL, MAN, SWEET.

10:59.241 --> 11:01.243
{\an8}- I HAVE, LIKE, A HA--
I HAVE, LIKE--

11:01.327 --> 11:02.828
{\an8}YEAH.
YOU HAVE GREAT EYELASHES.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.455
{\an8}- THANK YOU.
- [laughs]

11:04.538 --> 11:07.375
{\an8}- I USE BEING A WOMAN TO
MY ADVANTAGE FROM TIME TO TIME.

11:07.458 --> 11:10.127
{\an8}IS THERE A WORD, A NAME,
LIKE, A--

11:11.837 --> 11:12.963
{\an8}AWESOME.
YOU SAID THE MAGIC WORDS.

11:13.047 --> 11:17.676
ESPECIALLY 'CAUSE GUYS ARE
DUMB ENOUGH TO DO WHAT I SAY.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.097
I'M KNOWN FOR MORE
OF A GIRLY-FEEL TRADITIONAL.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.557
I LIKE TO PUT MY OWN SPIN
ON THINGS.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.976
MALE OR FEMALE,
YOU BETTER GET OUT OF MY WAY.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.353
I WILL CUT A BITCH TO GET
THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

11:27.436 --> 11:33.859
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE,
TWO, ONE.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.237
- OH, MY GOD.
- TIME'S UP, MACHINES DOWN.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.613
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S CALL IT.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.115
- NO MORE INK.
- AHH!

11:39.198 --> 11:40.324
- DONE.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.159
- I DID THREE TATTOOS.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.661
{\an8}GODDAMN HALO
DID SEVEN TATTOOS.

11:43.744 --> 11:46.497
- GLAD I GOT
TO SQUEEZE YOU IN, MAN.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.623
- SCOTT DID A HALF SLEEVE.

11:47.706 --> 11:48.624
- THIS HURTS
MORE THAN THE TATTOO.

11:48.707 --> 11:50.960
- WHAT THE [bleep] AM I EVEN
DOING HERE?

11:51.043 --> 11:54.713
I'M GOING HOME, LIKE, TONIGHT.

11:54.797 --> 11:58.175
{\an8}- I THINK I SPEAK FOR
EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS ROOM

11:58.259 --> 11:59.844
{\an8}WHEN I SAY,
"WHAT THE [bleep]?"

11:59.927 --> 12:01.178
- I AIN'T GOING HOME
ANYTIME SOON.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.888
YOU MOTHER[bleep] ARE GONNA
HAVE TO DEAL WITH ME.

12:08.185 --> 12:11.647
- ALL RIGHT, ARTISTS,
TIME TO CRITIQUE YOUR WORK.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.983
SAUSAGE.
- I LOOK AT ALL YOUR TATTOOS.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.819
YOU DEFINITELY SHOWED US THAT
YOU CAN DO SOME SMOOTH SHADING

12:16.902 --> 12:18.779
AND GET SOLID BLACKS
IN THERE.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.365
THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL YOU GOT
INTO THE EYE IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.033
- YOUR BLACK AND GRAY
AND YOUR LINE QUALITY

12:23.117 --> 12:24.493
IS SOME OF THE NICEST
IN THE ROOM.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.245
- THANK YOU, GUYS.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.664
- HALO.
- SEVEN TATTOOS

12:28.747 --> 12:29.832
IS A LOT OF TATTOOS, MAN.

12:29.915 --> 12:30.666
- YEAH, I SPENT ABOUT AN HOUR
ON EACH OF 'EM.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.793
- PROBLEM IS
THAT IT LOOKS LIKE IT.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.837
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE
TO GET THESE THINGS IN CLEAN.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.506
THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GONNA EARN
YOUR PLACE.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.301
- JIM.
- I WILL SAY 100%, MAN,

12:40.384 --> 12:41.677
THE DOVE IS A NICE TATTOO.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.846
IT SHOWS A LOT OF EXPERTISE
AND TECHNIQUE.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.347
JUST DOING
THE LIGHT-WASH SHADING,

12:45.431 --> 12:46.682
SMOOTH BLENDS
FROM DARK TO LIGHT.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.601
- THANK YOU.
- MELISSA.

12:48.684 --> 12:51.353
- LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW
HOW TO DESIGN A LITTLE BIT.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.272
AS FAR AS THE LAST TATTOO,

12:53.355 --> 12:55.608
IT HAS A VERY UNFINISHED LOOK
TO IT.

12:55.691 --> 12:58.861
- THE SHAKINESS OF THE OUTLINE,
YOU'RE COMING UP SHORT.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.905
- JAY.
- THIS NAUTICAL STAR TATTOO

13:00.988 --> 13:02.072
COULD'VE HAD A BOLDER OUTLINE.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.366
THE BIRD SKULL,
THIS IS THE KIND OF TATTOO

13:04.450 --> 13:06.160
YOU WANT
THAT THIN OUTLINE FOR.

13:06.243 --> 13:10.080
KNOWING WHERE AND WHEN TO USE
YOUR SKILLS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.916
- MATTI.
- I REALLY LIKE

13:11.999 --> 13:13.876
THE DETAIL THAT YOU PUT
IN THE STAR AND IN THE ANCHOR.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.879
YOU DEFINITELY DID
SOME OF THE CLEANEST TATTOOING

13:16.962 --> 13:19.465
IN THE CONVENTION.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

13:19.548 --> 13:22.009
{\an8}- MATTI, HE'S DEFINITELY
ONE OF THE BEST

13:22.092 --> 13:25.137
{\an8}THAT ARE TATTOOING TODAY.
HE'S SOMEBODY TO WATCH OUT FOR.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.555
- RANDY.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.557
- WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH THE SHAPE OF THIS SKULL?

13:28.641 --> 13:30.059
- IT'S GOT
SOME SERIOUS EYEBROWS.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.895
- SHAPE OF THE NOSE, THE WAY
THE ARCH OF THE TEETH COME DOWN.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.689
IT'S OUT OF WHACK.
- IF THIS IS A REPRESENTATION

13:35.773 --> 13:37.066
OF WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GIVE US,

13:37.149 --> 13:39.276
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A SHORT-LIVED TIME.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.903
- SCOTT.
- NICE-SIZED TATTOOS.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.154
VERY WELL DONE.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.365
SMOOTH, GOOD LINE WORK,
GOOD SHADING.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.617
- YOU ARE DEFINITELY SHINING.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.661
- BUBBA.
- THE BASEBALL TATTOO,

13:48.744 --> 13:50.746
IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT ROUND.
THE WINGS ARE POORLY DRAWN.

13:50.829 --> 13:53.040
- IF A BALL
IS PERFECTLY ROUND,

13:53.123 --> 13:53.666
THEN THE SHADING'S
PERFECTLY ROUND.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.668
IT THROWS IT OUT OF WHACK.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.044
- I MEAN, I DID WHAT I COULD
WITH WHAT I HAD.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.170
- THIS IS
THE KIND OF COMPETITION

13:58.254 --> 14:00.548
THAT SEPARATES THE MEN
FROM THE BOYS.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.383
- KEITH.
- THIS HORSESHOE,

14:02.466 --> 14:04.593
IT LOOKS REALLY OUT OF SHAPE.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.428
THE DETAIL IN THE BULLET'S
JUST NOT THERE.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.138
- THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF
THAT YOU'RE GONNA TAKE IT HEAVY

14:08.222 --> 14:09.932
THIS WHOLE RIDE
IF YOU CAN'T CLEAN THIS UP.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.100
- OH, I CAN CLEAN IT UP.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.644
- ASHLEY.
- LOOKING AT ALL YOUR TATTOOS,

14:13.727 --> 14:15.688
THE CONSISTENCY IN THIS
IS YOUR OUTLINES.

14:15.771 --> 14:16.564
THEY'RE STRONG, THEY'RE BOLD.

14:16.647 --> 14:17.856
- HOW CLEAN THE LETTERING IS,

14:17.940 --> 14:20.234
IT'S A GOOD POINT
THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

14:20.317 --> 14:21.151
- LETTERING'S MY THING.

14:21.235 --> 14:22.861
- WHICH IS GOOD.
- THANK YOU.

14:22.945 --> 14:23.946
- DAMON.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.573
- THAT SKULL,
THOSE BUBBLE TEETH.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.116
- SHE WAS LOOKING FOR CUTESY.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.493
- THAT'S NOT CUTESY, MAN.
THAT THING'S VERY WEIRD.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.161
I MEAN, YOU DID THREE
OF THE SIMPLEST TATTOOS

14:31.245 --> 14:35.124
IN THE ROOM, AND THERE'S
MANY FLAWS TO ALL THREE.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.667
- LYDIA.
- IT LOOKS LIKE

14:36.750 --> 14:38.794
FOUR DIFFERENT PEOPLE
TATTOOED IN YOUR BOOTH.

14:38.877 --> 14:41.130
THE SOLID FIELD OF COLOR
IN THE HORSESHOE

14:41.213 --> 14:44.633
DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE RUSHED,
CHOPPY COLOR IN THE LOTUS.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.010
- IF YOU'RE CRANKING OUT STUFF
LIKE THAT LOTUS,

14:46.093 --> 14:46.885
YOU MAY NOT BE AROUND
LONG ENOUGH

14:46.969 --> 14:49.430
TO DO SOMETHING BETTER
THE NEXT DAY.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.140
- DAVID.
- THE HEART, THE SCORPION,

14:51.223 --> 14:54.268
AND THE DREAM CATCHER, THEY ALL
SHOW SOME DECENT LINE WORK,

14:54.351 --> 14:57.980
BUT THE LAST TATTOO,
THE SHADING LOOKS REALLY RUSHED.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.149
NOT WHAT WE WANTED TO SEE.
- RIGHT, OKAY.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.234
- KING RUCK.
- OUTLINE ON THE SKULL

15:02.318 --> 15:05.362
IS PRETTY WELL JACKED UP
AND THE SAME WITH YOUR ROSE.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.823
- I GAVE IT MY BEST.
- YOU DIDN'T GIVE HER YOUR BEST.

15:07.906 --> 15:09.241
LOOK AT THAT ROSE.
THAT'S NOT YOUR BEST.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.452
- ROLAND.

15:11.535 --> 15:14.788
- WELL, ROLAND, I THINK
I SPEAK FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON

15:14.872 --> 15:16.957
IN THIS ROOM
WHEN I LOOK AT THAT CAT

15:17.041 --> 15:18.834
AND I SAY, "WHAT THE [bleep]?"

15:18.917 --> 15:20.461
- ART'S SUBJECTIVE, YOU KNOW,
IT'S SOMETHING

15:20.544 --> 15:22.546
THAT EVERYONE'S GONNA LOOK AT
AND SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.174
- THIS IS
A TATTOOING SKILL COMPETITION.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.093
THAT CAT IS JUST NOTHING
OTHER THAN AN ATROCITY.

15:30.095 --> 15:33.307
- WELL, RIGHT NOW,
THE THREE OF US HAVE TO DECIDE

15:33.390 --> 15:36.560
WHO'S GONNA GET A SURE SPOT
IN ONE OF OUR SHOPS.

15:36.644 --> 15:37.936
YOU GUYS WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THE TOP OF THE FIELD?

15:38.020 --> 15:40.522
- SCOTT--I THINK
HE'S DEFINITELY A STANDOUT.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.233
HIS FUNDAMENTALS WERE THERE.
- ANOTHER ONE THAT I THOUGHT

15:43.317 --> 15:44.234
SHOWED GOOD FUNDAMENTALS
WAS MATTI.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.528
- YOU GUYS SEEMED PRETTY HAPPY
WITH SAUSAGE.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.781
- HIS SHADING WAS NICE.
HIS LINE WORK WAS NICE.

15:48.864 --> 15:50.032
OVERALL, HE'S GONNA GIVE
THESE OTHER TWO GUYS A RUN.

15:50.115 --> 15:54.578
- DO YOU FEEL THAT THESE ARTISTS
HAVE ALL EARNED SPOTS?

15:54.662 --> 15:56.664
- DEFINITELY NOT.
- THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE

15:56.747 --> 15:58.332
THAT REALLY GOT OFF
TO A ROUGH START.

15:58.415 --> 16:01.293
- ONE OF THE ARTISTS THAT COMES
TO MIND FOR ME IS KING RUCK.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.212
- IT'S JUST A LOT
OF SHAKY LINES,

16:03.295 --> 16:04.630
A LOT OF BAD DESIGNING.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.048
- ROLAND'S TATTOOS
SHOW US NOTHING

16:06.131 --> 16:09.259
THAT HE KNOWS ANYTHING
ABOUT TATTOOING AT ALL.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.844
- IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE WE HAVE
A DECISION.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.555
- YEAH.
- LET'S LET 'EM KNOW.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.849
TODAY, WE TESTED
HOW WELL YOU WORK UNDER PRESSURE

16:15.933 --> 16:19.103
BY ASKING YOU TO TATTOO
CONVENTION STYLE.

16:19.186 --> 16:22.856
IT'S EARN YOUR SHOP
OR GO HOME.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.818
KYLE WAS GIVEN HIS SHOT
BY AMERICA

16:25.901 --> 16:27.194
AND DID NOT HAVE TO COMPETE.

16:27.277 --> 16:29.863
IF I SAY YOUR NAME,
YOU'VE EARNED A SHOP,

16:29.947 --> 16:33.575
AND YOUR SPOT IN THE COMPETITION
IS SECURE FOR NOW.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.078
MATTI,

16:36.161 --> 16:36.954
YOU HAVE EARNED YOUR SHOP.

16:37.037 --> 16:40.082
- CONGRATULATIONS, BRO.
- THANKS, MAN.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.501
- SCOTT.
- SWEET.

16:42.584 --> 16:44.420
- ASHLEY.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.214
SAUSAGE.

16:47.297 --> 16:49.133
JIM.
- FA--CHA.

16:51.719 --> 16:54.388
- FOR THE REST OF YOU,

16:54.471 --> 16:57.599
NONE OF YOU PROVED
THAT YOU DESERVE A SHOP.

16:57.683 --> 17:01.437
- I DID NOT COME HERE
TO JUST GO RIGHT BACK HOME.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.480
{\an8}IF I DIDN'T GET A SHOP,
I'M FREAKING THE [bleep] OUT.

17:03.564 --> 17:07.192
- HOWEVER, TOMORROW,
YOU'LL GET ONE MORE CHANCE

17:07.276 --> 17:10.154
TO PROVE YOUR WORTH.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.407
- GUYS, WE UNDERSTAND
THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE

17:14.491 --> 17:15.534
IN THIS FIRST CHALLENGE.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.286
A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT RATTLED.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.288
WE WANT TO SEE
THE BEST YOU CAN DO.

17:19.371 --> 17:23.291
- ONE THING IS FOR SURE--
AT THE END OF THE NEXT 24 HOURS,

17:23.375 --> 17:27.503
ONE OF YOU WILL BE GOING HOME.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.507
WE'LL SEE YOU AT THE SHOP.

17:41.685 --> 17:42.561
- WHOO-HOO!

17:42.644 --> 17:43.645
- ABOUT TIME.
- YEAH.

17:43.729 --> 17:44.438
- LET'S DO THIS.

17:44.521 --> 17:48.484
- OH.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.944
- OH, WOW.
- OH.

17:51.028 --> 17:55.616
- OH, MY GOODNESS.
THAT IS SICK.

17:55.699 --> 17:57.159
- [laughs]

17:57.242 --> 18:00.078
- OH, THIS LOOKS AWESOME.

18:00.162 --> 18:00.996
- THIS IS AWESOME.

18:01.079 --> 18:03.040
{\an8}I'VE NEVER HAD
MY OWN SHOP BEFORE,

18:03.123 --> 18:06.251
{\an8}SO THIS IS AMAZING TO ME.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.212
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- [crying] THANK YOU.

18:12.591 --> 18:15.177
- THIS IS BULL[bleep]
THAT I DON'T HAVE A ROOM YET.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.137
{\an8}HOW THE [bleep]
DID I NOT EARN MY SPOT?

18:17.221 --> 18:18.222
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

18:18.305 --> 18:21.266
I'M GONNA KNOCK THE NEXT ONE
OUT OF THE PARK.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.691
- WELCOME, ARTISTS.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.194
THIS WEEK, IT'S EARN YOUR SHOP
OR GO HOME.

18:34.780 --> 18:39.743
KYLE, MATTI, SCOTT, SAUSAGE,
ASHLEY, AND JIM,

18:39.827 --> 18:43.330
YOU EARNED YOUR SHOP
AND WILL NOT TATTOO TODAY.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.749
THE REST OF YOU
HAVE NOT EARNED A SHOP.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.335
YOU HAVE ONE MORE CHANCE.

18:48.418 --> 18:51.129
YOU MUST SHOW US
WHY YOU DESERVE TO BE HERE.

18:51.213 --> 18:54.633
TODAY, YOUR CANVASES
ARE COMPLETELY OPEN.

18:54.716 --> 18:55.884
YOU'LL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO THEM

18:55.968 --> 19:00.013
WITH THE DESIGN OF YOUR CHOICE
IN THE STYLE OF YOUR CHOICE.

19:00.097 --> 19:01.056
- [clapping]
- OOH.

19:01.139 --> 19:02.266
- ALL RIGHT.

19:02.349 --> 19:03.725
- MOST OF THE PAST SEASONS,
WE'VE HAD ARTISTS

19:03.809 --> 19:06.228
THAT HAVE COME ON
AND NOT GOT TO SHOW THEIR STYLE

19:06.311 --> 19:08.272
AND GONE HOME
BEFORE THEY EVEN HAD A CHANCE.

19:08.355 --> 19:10.440
NOW, YOU HAVE
THE ABILITY TO SHOW US

19:10.524 --> 19:12.359
THAT IT'S WORTH YOU BEING HERE.

19:12.442 --> 19:15.571
WE WANT TO SEE WHAT IT IS
THAT YOU LIKE TO DO.

19:15.654 --> 19:16.989
- I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE
TO TELL YOU

19:17.072 --> 19:18.365
THAT I'M VERY COMFORTABLE
RIGHT NOW, BUT I'M NOT.

19:18.448 --> 19:21.743
{\an8}I GET TO DO WHATEVER I WANT,
BUT I ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER

19:21.827 --> 19:25.747
{\an8}TIMING, COLOR, BLACK AND GRAY.
IT'S TERRIFYING.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.374
- ARTISTS, YOU'VE BEEN
RANDOMLY ASSIGNED A CANVAS,

19:27.457 --> 19:30.669
AND YOU WILL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO COMPLETE YOUR TATTOO.

19:30.752 --> 19:33.130
BASED ON YOUR WORK,
THE JUDGES WILL DETERMINE

19:33.213 --> 19:36.675
WHICH ONE OF YOU
WILL NEVER OPEN SHOP.

19:36.758 --> 19:38.385
GOOD LUCK.

19:38.468 --> 19:39.720
{\an8}- THIS IS EVERYONE'S OPPORTUNITY
TO SHINE

19:39.803 --> 19:42.514
{\an8}WITHOUT ANY EXCUSES AT ALL.

19:42.598 --> 19:43.974
I DO LIKE SKULLS A LOT TOO.

19:44.057 --> 19:44.975
{\an1}- SOON AS YOU SEE IT, PEOPLE ARE
GONNA BE LIKE, "HOLY [bleep]."

19:45.058 --> 19:46.602
- JUST DO SOMETHING
RIGHT AROUND HERE.

19:46.685 --> 19:50.272
- SO YOU LIKE A LITTLE BIT MORE
OF THE TRADITIONAL STYLE? OKAY.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.273
I'M FREAKING OUT.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.192
{\an8}NO ONE WANTS TO BE THE FIRST ONE
SENT HOME.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.527
- I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
POLYNESIAN TATTOO.

19:55.611 --> 19:56.987
DOES THAT SOUND NICE TO YOU?

19:57.070 --> 20:00.490
- I ACTUALLY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT IS.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.325
- I HAVE TO BE
IN THIS COMPETITION.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.869
{\an8}WHAT CAN I DO
TO REDEEM MYSELF?

20:03.952 --> 20:06.371
HOW AM I GONNA BRING MYSELF UP
FROM THE ABSOLUTE BOTTOM?

20:16.465 --> 20:18.634
- DAMN.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.385
I HAVE NOT EARNED MY SHOP.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.679
I AM PRETTY DAMN NERVOUS.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.348
- WHAT YOU DOING, DAMON?
- GO WITH THIS,

20:24.431 --> 20:25.682
THE DAY-OF-THE-DEAD TYPE
OF THING.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.059
- THE DRAWING'S NICE, DUDE.

20:27.142 --> 20:28.101
- I'VE ONLY BEEN TATTOOING
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS,

20:28.185 --> 20:30.938
BUT I SPENT FOUR YEARS
IN ART SCHOOL.

20:31.021 --> 20:33.023
I HAVE AN EXTREMELY STRONG
ARTISTIC BACKGROUND.

20:33.106 --> 20:35.359
JESUS CHRIST,
TIME HAS FLOWN BY.

20:35.442 --> 20:39.613
I AM AN UNDERDOG, BUT I HAVE
A BIG MOTHER[bleep] BITE.

20:39.696 --> 20:41.156
OH, MY GOD.
DAMN. UGH!

20:41.240 --> 20:43.533
- YOU SEEM TO BE BUGGING OUT
A LITTLE BIT.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.993
- YEAH.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.244
- DAMON CAN DRAW,
BUT HE CAN'T TATTOO.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.871
{\an8}IF HE GETS A SHOP,
IT'S AN INJUSTICE

20:47.955 --> 20:49.289
{\an8}TO A REAL TATTOO ARTIST.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.585
- [bleep]!

20:53.669 --> 20:55.796
- ARTISTS, THIS IS
YOUR LAST CHANCE

20:55.879 --> 20:56.922
TO EARN YOUR SHOP.

20:57.005 --> 21:00.384
YOU HAVE SIX HOURS TO TATTOO.

21:00.467 --> 21:04.137
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.514
- ALL RIGHT, BROTHER.
- LET'S GO.

21:05.597 --> 21:08.934
{\an8}- IN A CHALLENGE LIKE THIS,
WHERE YOUR CANVAS IS OPEN,

21:09.017 --> 21:12.312
{\an8}WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE THESE
ARTISTS EXPRESS THEMSELVES.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.063
THEY SHOULD BE READY
TO COMPETE.

21:13.146 --> 21:15.023
YOU WOULD HOPE
THIS IS GONNA BE

21:15.107 --> 21:16.608
THE BEST TATTOO
THEY'VE EVER DONE.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.278
THIS IS IT.
WHO EARNS A SHOP?

21:19.361 --> 21:19.569
WHO GOES HOME?

21:19.653 --> 21:21.196
- NICE.

21:21.279 --> 21:23.907
- ALL RIGHT, MAN.
GOOD LUCK TO US BOTH.

21:23.991 --> 21:29.204
[tattoo machines buzzing]

21:30.205 --> 21:33.041
{\an8}- UH-OH.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.877
{\an8}- HOW YOU DOING?
- I REALLY LIKE PORTRAIT WORK.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.171
{\an8}THIS IS A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN
RIGHT NOW.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.048
{\an8}I DEFINITELY DIDN'T EXPECT
TO BE AT THE BOTTOM.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.217
{\an8}I THINK EVERYONE ON TOP
SHOULD BE NERVOUS

21:42.300 --> 21:44.469
{\an8}ABOUT WHERE THEY SIT,
'CAUSE WE'RE COMING BACK.

21:44.553 --> 21:45.429
IF I GO HOME,
IT'S NOT GONNA BE TODAY,

21:45.512 --> 21:47.764
AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE
OFF OF A CHALLENGE

21:47.848 --> 21:51.685
WHERE I GET TO DO WHAT I WANT--
THAT'S FOR [bleep] SURE.

21:51.768 --> 21:52.894
- FEEL BETTER TODAY?

21:52.978 --> 21:54.396
- I'M LITERALLY PROBABLY
GONNA BE THAT NERVOUS

21:54.479 --> 21:55.814
EVERY SINGLE TIME.

21:55.897 --> 21:56.898
{\an8}I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC STYLE.

21:56.982 --> 22:00.694
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO JUST DO
WHATEVER ANYONE WANTS.

22:00.777 --> 22:01.737
- ARE YOU DOING
JUST ALL BLACK AND GRAY?

22:01.820 --> 22:04.489
- NO, I'M GONNA BE DOING
SOME COLOR AS WELL.

22:04.573 --> 22:08.243
{\an1}A TRADITIONAL-STYLE DESIGN SHOWS
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF TATTOOING.

22:08.326 --> 22:09.786
THAT'S HOW I'M GOING TO EARN
A SHOP.

22:09.870 --> 22:12.330
- FOUR HOURS REMAINING.

22:15.417 --> 22:17.294
- WHAT'D YOU COME UP WITH?
CAN I LOOK?

22:17.377 --> 22:19.588
{\an8}- THIS IS
A VERY DETAILED TATTOO.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.089
- YOU GOT ANY WORRIES
ON TIME HERE?

22:21.173 --> 22:21.757
- YEAH, I WAS JUST GONNA SAY
THE SAME THING.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.884
- A LITTLE BIT.

22:23.967 --> 22:26.094
- DAMON HAS BITTEN OFF
MORE THAN HE CAN CHEW.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.512
{\an8}HIS LINE WORK IS SHAKY,

22:27.596 --> 22:29.556
{\an8}AND HE'S TRYING
TO PULL OUT TRICKS

22:29.639 --> 22:32.601
{\an8}THAT HIGH-LEVEL ARTISTS
RARELY ATTEMPT.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.438
{\an8}- RANDY.
- YES, SIR.

22:36.521 --> 22:40.484
{\an8}I DECIDE TO DO
A PHOTO-REALISTIC CLIPPER SHIP.

22:40.567 --> 22:44.071
{\an8}IT'S GOT LINES, IT'S GOT BLACK,
IT'S GOT COLOR.

22:44.154 --> 22:46.823
{\an8}- RANDY IS ON A SHIP
TO NOWHERE.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.076
{\an8}IT'S MESSY, IT'S NOT CLEAR,
IT'S NOT CLEAN,

22:49.159 --> 22:49.868
{\an8}AND IT SHOULD NOT HAVE
A HOME HERE.

22:49.951 --> 22:53.789
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.750
{\an8}- I'M DOING A BIG OL' CRAZY,
BLACK-AND-GRAY SKULL.

22:56.833 --> 22:57.793
{\an8}MY REPUTATION'S ON THE LINE
TODAY.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.294
IT'S MORE THAN ESSENTIAL
THAT I REDEEM MYSELF.

22:59.377 --> 23:01.129
- YOU'VE BEEN
ENJOYING TATTOOING

23:01.213 --> 23:02.756
FOR 20 YEARS?
- YEP.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.050
I DO MAINLY
FINE LINE BLACK AND GRAY.

23:05.133 --> 23:06.968
IF I WANT SOMETHING,
I WILL PUNCH AND KICK

23:07.052 --> 23:09.638
AND FIGHT TILL I GET IT.

23:09.721 --> 23:12.849
- YOU ALSO HAVE
OVER 20 NATIONAL AWARDS.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.394
- YES.
- IT SAYS RIGHT HERE, LOOK.

23:15.477 --> 23:18.313
DAVID HAD SOME STRONG TATTOOS
IN THE CONVENTION SETTING.

23:18.396 --> 23:20.524
COMING INTO THIS OPEN CANVAS
CHALLENGE, THIS TATTOO,

23:20.607 --> 23:21.983
IT'S HARD TO TELL
WHAT'S GOING ON.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.485
SEEMS LIKE HE'S TAKEN
A STEP BACKWARDS.

23:23.568 --> 23:25.237
ALL RIGHT, DAVID,
WE'LL SEE YOU IN A BIT.

23:25.320 --> 23:28.156
- TWO MORE HOURS REMAINING.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.579
- WHAT'S UP, DAVE?
- HI, DARLING.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.999
WOW, WHAT IS THIS?
LIKE A FANTASY SUGAR SKULL?

23:38.083 --> 23:39.167
- YES,
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON

23:39.251 --> 23:40.794
IN MY CRAZY IMAGINATION.
- COOL.

23:40.877 --> 23:42.337
{\an8}- I'VE BEEN TATTOOING
FOR TEN YEARS.

23:42.420 --> 23:46.049
MY TATTOOS ARE SURREAL.
I FELL IN LOVE TATTOOING.

23:46.133 --> 23:49.594
JUST KEPT GOING FOR IT INTO THAT
VOID OF ART, NEEDLES, BLOOD.

23:49.678 --> 23:54.349
SO EXCITED RIGHT NOW THAT I GET
TO DO SOMETHING, LIKE, JUST--

23:54.432 --> 23:57.269
- WHATEVER THE [bleep] YOU WANT.
- YEAH, IT'S AWESOME.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.437
- WHAT'S UP, GUY?

23:59.521 --> 24:02.482
DOING WHAT YOU DO BEST?
SOME TIBETAN?

24:02.566 --> 24:04.609
- TIBETAN?
NO, THIS IS POLYNESIAN.

24:04.693 --> 24:05.569
I GOT MY ASS HANDED TO ME.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.237
I JUST NEEDED TO GET MY HEAD
IN THE GAME.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.989
- IT'S NOT CALLED
"INK MEDIOCRE."

24:09.072 --> 24:11.658
IT'S CALLED <i> "INK MASTER."</i>

24:11.741 --> 24:13.326
{\an8}- WE'RE ALL
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK,

24:13.410 --> 24:14.828
{\an8}BUT BASED ON WHAT I'VE DONE
AT THE CONVENTION,

24:14.911 --> 24:18.206
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE I HAVE MORE OF
A SUBSTANTIAL MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.625
{\an8}- I THINK I SPEAK
FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON

24:20.709 --> 24:22.794
{\an8}IN THIS ROOM
WHEN I LOOK AT THAT CAT

24:22.878 --> 24:25.380
{\an8}AND I SAY,
"WHAT THE [bleep]?"

24:25.463 --> 24:27.841
{\an8}- ROLAND'S TATTOO
IS THE WORST.

24:27.924 --> 24:29.593
{\an8}I MEAN, HE TOOK
SUCH AN EASY WAY OUT.

24:29.676 --> 24:33.221
ANYBODY CAN DO TRIBAL.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.640
- TEN MINUTES REMAIN.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.063
- OH, MY GOD. OH!
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

24:42.147 --> 24:43.356
- OH, I WANT TO KILL YOU.
- PLEASE DON'T KILL ME.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.483
- YOU'RE JUST CAUSING ME
A LOT OF PAIN.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.862
- ♪ BUT I'M SO CLOSE,
IT'S CRAZY ♪

24:48.945 --> 24:50.322
I'VE BEEN TATTOOING
FOR 13 YEARS.

24:50.405 --> 24:53.909
I SPECIALIZE IN A MODERN STYLE
OF TRADITIONAL TATTOOING.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.202
GET IT, GET IT OUT, AH!

24:55.285 --> 24:57.704
{\an8}I WANT TO BE THE MAN IN THE END
THAT SAYS,

24:57.787 --> 24:58.997
{\an8}"I AM THE INK MASTER."

24:59.080 --> 25:01.333
I CAN TASTE VICTORY,
AND IT'S SWEET.

25:01.416 --> 25:04.419
- AND FIVE, FOUR,

25:04.502 --> 25:07.756
THREE, TWO, ONE.

25:07.839 --> 25:10.467
THAT'S IT.
MACHINES DOWN, NO MORE INK.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.093
- ALL RIGHT.
- WHOO!

25:12.177 --> 25:13.929
- ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

25:14.012 --> 25:16.765
- HOLY [bleep]!

25:16.848 --> 25:18.099
- IS SHE BADASS OR WHAT?

25:18.183 --> 25:21.228
- THAT IS SICK.
THAT'S AWESOME, DUDE.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.938
- GOD, SHE LOOKS SO GOOD.

25:23.021 --> 25:23.939
- DAMON'S DAY-OF-THE-DEAD GIRL,

25:24.022 --> 25:26.316
THE PART IN HER HAIR
LOOKS LIKE A GIANT SCAR

25:26.399 --> 25:27.609
LIKE SHE HAD AN AX WOUND.

25:27.692 --> 25:29.444
IT'S WAY TOO WIDE.
IT'S WAY TOO LIGHT.

25:29.527 --> 25:31.196
IF MY GIRL
CAME HOME WITH THAT,

25:31.279 --> 25:34.241
I'D HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM
WITH DAMON.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.618
{\an8}- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
- I'M ANGRY NOW.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.954
{\an8}- WE ALL JUST GOT PUNCHED
IN THE [bleep] NUTS.

25:39.037 --> 25:41.164
- YOU HAVE A MAJOR ISSUE.
- I DID IT ON PURPOSE.

25:41.248 --> 25:42.415
- DID YOU NOT WANT
TO BE HERE?

25:42.499 --> 25:43.667
- I BIT OFF A LITTLE BIT MORE
THAN I CAN CHEW.

25:43.750 --> 25:44.584
- GET READY FOR A HARD RIDE.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.134
- WE'RE ALL BEING TOLD
THAT WE'RE THE BOTTOM,

25:53.218 --> 25:54.803
BUT I KNOW FOR A FACT

25:54.886 --> 25:56.972
I'M NOT A BOTTOM-OF-THE-BOAT
TATTOO ARTIST.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.139
- NO, I DON'T THINK
I SHOULD BE IN THE BOTTOM,

25:58.223 --> 25:59.891
AND I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE
IN THE BOTTOM EITHER.

25:59.975 --> 26:01.935
- I'VE NEVER IN MY LIFE
BEEN AT THE BOTTOM OF ANYTHING.

26:02.018 --> 26:03.645
- I ALSO DON'T THINK ANYBODY
THAT'S OUT THERE RIGHT NOW

26:03.728 --> 26:04.479
THAT HAS A SHOP BLEW ANY OF US
OUT OF THE WATER.

26:04.562 --> 26:07.315
- NAH, MAN.
- THEY WEREN'T BETTER.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.817
I DON'T THINK THEY WERE BETTER.
- ASHLEY DIDN'T IMPRESS ME.

26:08.900 --> 26:11.194
[bleep] ASHLEY. LIKE, WHY DOES
SHE HAVE A SHOP AND I DON'T?

26:11.278 --> 26:12.320
- THAT WAS THE ONE
WHO I WAS JUST LIKE--

26:12.404 --> 26:13.947
WHEN SHE GOT CALLED UP,
I WAS LIKE, "WAIT, WHAT?"

26:14.030 --> 26:16.157
- [bleep].
- "ARE YOU SERIOUS?"

26:16.241 --> 26:17.409
- I COULD LOOK AT THINGS
THAT HE DID,

26:17.492 --> 26:18.535
I CAN LOOK AT THINGS
THAT HE DID AND BE LIKE,

26:18.618 --> 26:19.661
"WELL, THAT'S BETTER
THAN [bleep] ASHLEY'S.

26:19.744 --> 26:20.996
THAT'S BETTER THAN JIM."

26:21.079 --> 26:22.205
WHAT THE [bleep] ARE THEY DOING
IN THE OTHER GROUP? HONESTLY.

26:22.289 --> 26:25.667
{\an8}I THINK I DID A BETTER JOB
THAN PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.461
IF I DON'T EARN A SHOP,
YEAH, I'M GONNA WANT

26:28.545 --> 26:30.588
TO BURN
THE [bleep] BUILDING DOWN.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.674
- THE "CONVENTION" DOESN'T MEAN
[bleep] ON WHAT'S TODAY.

26:32.757 --> 26:35.677
- ALL THAT [bleep]
IS IN THE PAST. I'M ANGRY NOW.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.554
I'M GONNA [bleep]
ON EVERYONE.

26:37.637 --> 26:39.556
EVERY ONE I CAN GET A CHANCE,
I'M GONNA [bleep] ON YOU.

26:39.639 --> 26:40.849
- I AIN'T GOING HOME
ANYTIME SOON.

26:40.932 --> 26:43.685
YOU MOTHER[bleep] ARE GONNA
HAVE TO DEAL WITH ME.

26:58.950 --> 27:02.996
- ARTISTS, THIS WEEK YOU'RE
FIGHTING FOR AN <i> INK MASTER</i> SHOP,

27:03.079 --> 27:06.374
AND ONE OF YOU WON'T GET ONE.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.501
- EVERY SINGLE PERSON DID BETTER
THAN THEY DID IN THE CONVENTION,

27:08.585 --> 27:12.881
SO YOUR COMPETITION
IS STACKED HIGH.

27:12.964 --> 27:15.592
- HALO,
LET'S START WITH YOU.

27:15.675 --> 27:17.761
- FROM WHAT WE SAW
IN THE CONVENTION HALL,

27:17.844 --> 27:19.721
YOU DID BRING YOURSELF BACK
A LOT.

27:19.804 --> 27:21.765
OVERALL, MAN,
YOU DID A NICE, BIG TATTOO.

27:21.848 --> 27:24.893
YOUR BLACK-AND-GRAY SHADING
IS SMOOTH AND NICE,

27:24.976 --> 27:27.937
BUT YOU STILL DO HAVE SOME AREAS
THAT YOU NEED TO TIGHTEN UP.

27:28.021 --> 27:30.273
WHAT JUMPS OUT IMMEDIATELY
IS THE WEIRD HAIR

27:30.357 --> 27:32.400
THAT GOES OVER THE NECK
AND THE COLLARBONE

27:32.484 --> 27:33.526
AND THEN THE BIG, OPEN PIECE
OF HAIR THAT YOU HAVE

27:33.610 --> 27:35.570
THAT JUST FLOATS
IN THE MIDDLE.

27:35.653 --> 27:37.238
- I DID IT ON PURPOSE.
I WANTED TO BREAK 'EM UP.

27:37.322 --> 27:38.323
- IT JUST STANDS OUT.

27:38.406 --> 27:40.617
THESE ARE NITPICKY THINGS,
BUT THIS IS THE STUFF

27:40.700 --> 27:42.702
THAT YOU HAVE TO HEAR
TO GET BETTER MOVING FORWARD.

27:44.662 --> 27:47.415
- MELISSA.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.417
HOW DO YOU FEEL YOU RANK
AMONG THE FIELD

27:49.501 --> 27:52.045
IN TERMS OF EXPERIENCE?
- DEFINITELY ONE OF THE PEOPLE

27:52.128 --> 27:53.880
THAT'S BEEN TATTOOING
FOR THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME,

27:53.963 --> 27:55.090
SO THAT'S INTIMIDATING.

27:55.173 --> 27:57.759
- YOU DEFINITELY SHOWED US
YOU HAVE THE SKILLS

27:57.842 --> 28:00.220
AND TECHNIQUES TO LAY
AN OUTLINE, DO SOME SHADING.

28:00.303 --> 28:02.972
I LIKE THE DESIGN, I LIKE
A LOT OF ELEMENTS OF THIS THING.

28:03.056 --> 28:03.932
- OUT OF EVERYBODY
THAT'S BEEN UP HERE,

28:04.015 --> 28:05.308
YOU'VE DONE
THE MOST DELIBERATE OUTLINE.

28:05.392 --> 28:08.144
- THANK YOU.
- HOWEVER,

28:08.228 --> 28:11.689
A BIG THING WITH THIS TATTOO IS
THE CROW RUNNING INTO THE HAIR.

28:11.773 --> 28:14.943
THIS WALL-TO-WALL TATTOOING
WITH NO BREAK ANYWHERE,

28:15.026 --> 28:16.694
IT'S GONNA BE MUDDY,
WITHOUT A DOUBT.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.279
YOU NEED TO KNOW
WHAT YOUR TATTOOS ARE GONNA

28:18.363 --> 28:21.533
HEAL LIKE
AND LOOK LIKE LATER.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.621
- KEITH.

28:26.704 --> 28:28.331
- IT'S NOT REALLY
AN ATTRACTIVE LADY.

28:28.415 --> 28:29.624
Y'ALL GET THAT FEELING?

28:29.707 --> 28:30.792
- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A MAN
OR A WOMAN.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.503
- IT KIND OF HAS
A VERY MANNISH LOOK TO IT.

28:33.586 --> 28:35.547
VERY HARSH AND VERY STRICT.

28:35.630 --> 28:37.715
- WITH THE TATTOO BEING SO DARK,
IN A SENSE,

28:37.799 --> 28:40.802
I KIND OF MADE HER FACE
SO IT'D KIND OF MATCH.

28:40.885 --> 28:44.722
I CAN'T HAVE A WEIRD CREATURE
AND THEN HAVE A BEAUTIFUL FACE.

28:44.806 --> 28:45.807
- YOU COULD.

28:45.890 --> 28:48.476
THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY
TO EARN A ROOM TODAY.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.813
IF YOU GIVE ME THIS,
I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO QUESTION

28:51.896 --> 28:56.025
IF YOU SHOULD BE HERE.

28:56.109 --> 29:00.613
- NEXT UP, KING RUCK.

29:00.697 --> 29:02.824
- YOU HAD MULTIPLE REFERENCES
FOR A WOLF FACE,

29:02.907 --> 29:05.285
AND YOU TOOK DIFFERENT PIECES
OF DIFFERENT WOLVES

29:05.368 --> 29:07.829
AND PUT 'EM TOGETHER,
AND THEY DIDN'T LINE UP.

29:07.912 --> 29:10.415
THE TEETH ARE COMING
STRAIGHT AT YOU.

29:10.498 --> 29:14.169
ONE EYE IS GOING ONE WAY.
THE NOSE IS TWISTED OFF.

29:14.252 --> 29:17.088
IF YOU'RE GONNA PLAY GOD AND
MIX UP THREE DIFFERENT WOLVES,

29:17.172 --> 29:20.175
THEY ALL GOT TO BE ATTACHED
TO THE SAME SKULL.

29:20.258 --> 29:21.718
- I COME
FROM A GRAFFITI BACKGROUND.

29:21.801 --> 29:23.344
NOTHING IS PICTURE PERFECT.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.138
I KIND OF WANTED TO GIVE IT
THAT ROCKY,

29:25.221 --> 29:27.182
HE'S KIND OF LEANING IN,
MOVING OUT.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.184
- NONE OF THAT DRAWING
TRANSLATES TO TATTOOING.

29:29.267 --> 29:32.187
YOU ARE, ON PAPER,
A VERY TALENTED ARTIST.

29:32.270 --> 29:34.189
YOU HAVE TO ELEVATE
YOUR ARTIST SKILL ON PAPER

29:34.272 --> 29:38.693
TO SKILL ON SKIN.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.947
- LYDIA.

29:44.032 --> 29:47.452
- THE FIRST THING THAT
JUMPS OUT TO ME IS CONTRAST.

29:47.535 --> 29:49.954
YOUR BACKGROUND EITHER NEEDS
TO BE A LOT DARKER

29:50.038 --> 29:51.873
THAN THE FOREGROUND OR A LOT
LIGHTER THAN THE FOREGROUND.

29:51.956 --> 29:54.751
WITH IT BEING
THE SAME TONE THROUGHOUT,

29:54.834 --> 29:56.878
FROM ACROSS THE ROOM,
IT'S A BIG, BLACK SPOT.

29:56.961 --> 29:58.004
- I ACTUALLY TONED DOWN
THE BACKGROUND A BIT

29:58.087 --> 30:01.216
TO KEEP THE SUBJECT MATTER
FROM GETTING MUDDLED.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.842
- THIS TATTOO DOES NOT
JUMP OUT AT ME LIKE,

30:02.926 --> 30:05.929
"SHE'S DEFINITELY EARNED
HER SPOT, SHE'S HERE."

30:08.973 --> 30:12.060
- BUBBA.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.728
- THE THING
ABOUT THIS SKIN RIP IS

30:13.811 --> 30:14.938
IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE
A FLESHY LOOK TO IT.

30:15.021 --> 30:17.649
IT LOOKS VERY RIGID AND--
- IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE

30:17.732 --> 30:20.026
IT WAS DONE A WHILE BACK,
NOT LIKE IT JUST HAPPENED.

30:20.109 --> 30:21.110
- IT'S JUST KIND OF AWKWARD.

30:21.194 --> 30:22.862
- YOU HAVE MANY PROBLEMS
WITH YOUR OUTLINE.

30:22.946 --> 30:26.783
ALL YOUR SCREW CIRCLES
ARE FLAT ON ONE SIDE.

30:26.866 --> 30:28.993
THEY DON'T HAVE
THAT PERFECTLY ROUND AREA.

30:29.077 --> 30:31.412
IF YOU'RE DOING MECHANICS,
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE PERFECT,

30:31.496 --> 30:33.706
AND IF YOU'RE GONNA CHALLENGE
YOURSELF TO DO IT,

30:33.790 --> 30:37.794
THEN YOU'RE GONNA
EXPOSE YOURSELF IF YOU CAN'T.

30:37.877 --> 30:40.838
- DAVID.

30:40.922 --> 30:43.925
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS TATTOO
WILL EARN YOU A SHOP HERE?

30:44.008 --> 30:45.510
- I'M HAPPY WITH IT.
I THINK IT LOOKS PRETTY COOL.

30:45.593 --> 30:47.595
- BUT IS IT READABLE?

30:47.679 --> 30:49.889
CAN ANYBODY LOOK AT IT
AND GO, "SKULL"?

30:49.973 --> 30:51.349
- SKULL-ISH.

30:51.432 --> 30:54.102
LOOK AT THE NOSE,
THE MOUTH, THE JAWBONE.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.103
HARD TO SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE.

30:55.186 --> 30:57.605
IT'S A MESS.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.483
- YOU DIDN'T MAKE
A GREAT DECISION HERE.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.612
- GENTLE JAY.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.614
- THIS TATTOO'S
VERY RECOGNIZABLE.

31:06.698 --> 31:09.701
THE DETAIL IN IT IS NICE.
THE OUTLINE LOOKS REALLY CLEAN.

31:09.784 --> 31:12.662
DESIGN-WISE, IT JUST HAS
A VERY STALE APPEARANCE TO IT.

31:12.745 --> 31:15.582
JUST THE TWO ROSES
PERFECTLY ON THE SIDE,

31:15.665 --> 31:17.959
BOTH HAVE THREE LEAVES,
ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.295
YOU HAND-DREW THIS THING
FOR THIS GUY PERSONALLY.

31:20.378 --> 31:21.588
- YEAH.
- MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THAT.

31:21.671 --> 31:24.173
- AND IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE
TO ARTISTICALLY PUT OUT

31:24.257 --> 31:28.386
GREAT COMPOSITION FROM THE START
TO BACK UP GREAT TATTOOING,

31:28.469 --> 31:32.056
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LAST,
NOT LONG.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.434
- RANDY.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.561
YOU ARE A PHOTO-REALISM GUY,
RIGHT?

31:36.644 --> 31:38.646
- THAT'S TYPICALLY
WHAT I GET ASKED TO DO.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.857
- THIS THING IS VERY PATCHY.

31:40.940 --> 31:44.277
THIS HAS THAT REMEDIAL
PAINT-BY-NUMBER LOOK TO IT.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.696
THAT'S WHERE THAT COLOR ENDS,
THIS IS WHERE THIS COLOR ENDS,

31:46.779 --> 31:48.114
THIS IS WHERE
THIS COLOR STARTS.

31:48.197 --> 31:51.784
FROM THE BLACK TO THE BROWN
TO THE ORANGE TO THE YELLOW,

31:51.868 --> 31:53.661
THERE'S NO SOFT FADES.

31:53.745 --> 31:57.373
- IT WAS KIND OF MEANT TO BE
MORE OF A PAINTING STYLE.

31:57.457 --> 32:01.461
- EVEN IF YOU TAKE A PAINTERLY
APPROACH AT A REAL PHOTO,

32:01.544 --> 32:05.048
YOUR QUALITY OF APPLICATION
STILL HAS TO BE THERE.

32:05.131 --> 32:07.842
WE'RE LACKING THAT.

32:08.843 --> 32:11.679
- DAMON.

32:11.763 --> 32:15.725
- LOOKING AT THIS TATTOO,
YOUR INEXPERIENCE REALLY SHOWS.

32:15.808 --> 32:19.520
THE SHADING IN THE SPIDERWEB
ON HER FOREHEAD, VERY SPLOTCHY.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.856
THERE'S A LOT
OF INCONSISTENCY,

32:21.939 --> 32:24.734
A LOT OF WEAK OUTLINES,
AND IT'S JUST NOT SMOOTH.

32:24.817 --> 32:27.195
THERE WAS NO CARE OR ATTENTION
TO DETAIL PUT INTO THIS.

32:27.278 --> 32:29.197
- I HONESTLY DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS, LIKE, THAT BAD.

32:29.280 --> 32:32.950
- IF YOU CANNOT SEE THE MANY
PROBLEMS WITH YOUR OUTLINE,

32:33.034 --> 32:36.579
THEN YOU HAVE A MAJOR ISSUE.

32:38.998 --> 32:41.084
- ROLAND.

32:41.167 --> 32:44.545
- KNOWING THAT POLYNESIAN
IS YOUR SPECIALTY,

32:44.629 --> 32:46.547
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR KNOWLEDGE

32:46.631 --> 32:49.217
AND THE LAYOUT AND THE WAY
YOU FIT THIS TO THE LEG.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.552
MY FEAR IS,
FURTHER IN THIS COMPETITION,

32:51.636 --> 32:54.430
DO YOU HAVE THE OTHER SKILLS
THAT ARE GONNA BE NEEDED

32:54.514 --> 32:55.390
TO DO ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES?

32:55.473 --> 32:57.558
- THE TATTOOING YOU DID
AT THE CONVENTION,

32:57.642 --> 32:59.560
THERE'S NOT A PERSON
IN THIS ROOM

32:59.644 --> 33:00.895
THAT LOOKED AT THAT CAT
AND SAID, "HEY,

33:00.978 --> 33:04.065
THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL-GRADE
QUALITY TATTOO."

33:04.148 --> 33:06.067
THAT STUFF IS NOT GOING TO WORK
IN THIS COMPETITION.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.740
- ALL RIGHT, ARTISTS,
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.410
WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

33:21.999 --> 33:24.669
- I'VE GOT ISSUES
WITH YOUR LACK OF EXPERIENCE.

33:24.752 --> 33:27.672
I MEAN, DO YOU HONESTLY FEEL
WE'RE ON THE SAME LEVEL,

33:27.755 --> 33:28.798
THAT YOU HAVE A CHANCE
OF BEATING ME?

33:28.881 --> 33:30.007
- YES.
YOU KNOW, I KNOW I CAN DRAW

33:30.091 --> 33:32.969
TEN TIMES BETTER
THAN A LOT OF PEOPLE IN HERE.

33:33.052 --> 33:34.137
{\an1}- "I WENT TO [bleep] ART SCHOOL,
AND I GOT A DEGREE, WHATEVER."

33:34.220 --> 33:36.013
- ART SCHOOL DOESN'T TEACH YOU
HOW TO TATTOO, YOU KNOW.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.473
- NO, IT DOESN'T TEACH YOU

33:37.557 --> 33:39.267
HOW TO TATTOO, BUT IT DOES
TEACH YOU HOW TO DESIGN,

33:39.350 --> 33:40.518
AND QUITE HONESTLY,
WITH YOUR DESIGN,

33:40.601 --> 33:43.229
FROM AN ILLUSTRATOR'S POINT
OF VIEW, WHEN I LOOKED AT IT,

33:43.312 --> 33:45.606
ONE, THE ROSE IN THE MOUTH
LOOKED LIKE A CUPCAKE.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.483
TWO, THE ROSES ON THE SIDE,

33:47.567 --> 33:49.944
I WOULD HAVE NEVER,
IN MY ENTIRE ILLUSTRATIVE LIFE,

33:50.027 --> 33:51.988
PUT THOSE ROSES
DOWN TOWARD THE BOTTOM.

33:52.071 --> 33:53.823
I WOULD HAVE PUT THEM
UP TOWARD THE TOP

33:53.906 --> 33:55.074
SO THAT THEY FORM A TRIANGLE.

33:55.158 --> 33:55.908
- YOU WOULD HAVE MADE IT LOOK
LIKE MICKEY MOUSE

33:55.992 --> 33:57.994
WITH THAT [bleep],
SO RIGHT THERE,

33:58.077 --> 33:58.995
YOU JUST STEPPED
ON YOUR OWN DICK.

33:59.078 --> 34:00.496
- NAH, NOT AT ALL.
- YEAH, YOU DID.

34:00.580 --> 34:03.624
DAMON TRYING TO TELL ME THAT
MY DESIGN DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT,

34:03.708 --> 34:04.792
IT'S LIKE A TWO-YEAR-OLD
TEACHING THEIR FATHER

34:04.876 --> 34:05.710
HOW TO WALK.

34:05.793 --> 34:06.961
- IF ANYTHING,
YOURS LOOKED

34:07.044 --> 34:09.172
LIKE IT WAS
MORE OF A BEGINNER TATTOO.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.591
- DUDE, THAT THING WAS BUSTED.
- IT WAS PRETTY BEAT.

34:11.674 --> 34:13.842
- NONETHELESS, I'M STILL
TATTOOING NEXT TO YOU.

34:13.926 --> 34:14.761
- BUT DO YOU DESERVE IT?

34:14.844 --> 34:19.514
- I--GODDAMN STRAIGHT I DO.

34:27.648 --> 34:29.150
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
EARN YOUR SHOP OR GO HOME.

34:29.233 --> 34:32.360
THEY'RE DOING THE TATTOOS
OF THEIR CHOICE.

34:32.445 --> 34:35.739
OPEN CANVASES.
EVERYBODY, IN SOME SMALL WAY,

34:35.822 --> 34:38.076
REDEEMED THEMSELVES
FROM THE CONVENTION.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.534
WHO WENT LEAPS AND BOUNDS?

34:39.619 --> 34:40.953
- OBVIOUSLY, HALO--
IT'S DEFINITELY

34:41.036 --> 34:42.038
ONE OF THE BEST TATTOOS
WE SEE TODAY.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.665
- NICE SHADING,
A LOT OF POTENTIAL.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.125
- I WAS VERY SURPRISED AND HAPPY
WITH WHAT MELISSA TURNED IN.

34:46.208 --> 34:48.543
- THE OUTLINE ON THIS TATTOO'S
VERY NICE.

34:48.628 --> 34:50.630
- WAY BETTER THAN SOME
OF THESE ONES IN THE BOTTOM.

34:50.713 --> 34:51.880
- SO LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE BOTTOM.

34:51.964 --> 34:53.507
WHO DOESN'T DESERVE
A SHOP HERE?

34:53.591 --> 34:55.927
- YOU GOT RANDY,
WHO DID NOT DO SOLID BLACK,

34:56.010 --> 34:59.806
WHO DID A LOT OF CROOKED LINES.
I MEAN, THAT SHIP IS A MESS.

34:59.889 --> 35:01.808
- IT'S A MESS,
BUT IT CAN BE FIXED.

35:01.891 --> 35:03.559
IF I ENDED UP
WITH DAVID'S TATTOO,

35:03.643 --> 35:04.519
I'D HAVE TO BLACK OUT
THAT LEG.

35:04.602 --> 35:07.396
- SKULLS,
ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE IMAGES

35:07.480 --> 35:08.731
IN THE HISTORY OF TATTOOING.

35:08.815 --> 35:12.026
THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T
LOOK AT THIS AND SEE A TOOTH,

35:12.109 --> 35:14.612
THAT HELPS IT
NOT LOOK LIKE A SKULL.

35:14.695 --> 35:16.239
HE [bleep] UP.
- IF YOU HAD TO WEAR

35:16.322 --> 35:18.699
DAVID'S SKULL
OR DAMON'S DAY-OF-THE-DEAD GIRL,

35:18.783 --> 35:19.700
WHAT WOULD YOU CHOOSE?

35:19.784 --> 35:22.119
- THIS TATTOO HAS
A LOT OF TECHNICAL FLAWS.

35:22.203 --> 35:23.371
- I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

35:23.454 --> 35:25.915
HOWEVER, IT'S WAY MORE LEGIBLE
AND READABLE

35:25.998 --> 35:28.876
THAN THE SKULL WE SAW
FROM THE 20-YEAR VETERAN.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.670
- THAT FLOWER ON HER CHIN
IS JACKED,

35:30.753 --> 35:33.673
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE SHADING
UNDERNEATH HER RIGHT EYE,

35:33.756 --> 35:35.842
JUST PAY ATTENTION
TO JUST THESE DETAILS,

35:35.925 --> 35:37.885
IF YOU BLOCK OUT THE IMAGE
OF THE WHOLE GIRL

35:37.969 --> 35:39.262
