00:01.047 --> 00:02.787
<i>Previously on</i>
Covert Affairs...

00:02.787 --> 00:04.509
I read in your file
about an application

00:04.534 --> 00:06.034
Code name: Hummingbird.

00:06.059 --> 00:08.214
Sounded like a way
to track anybody anywhere.

00:08.496 --> 00:10.124
I have a son.
His name is Teo.

00:10.163 --> 00:12.581
He's an undercover
operative inside ALC.

00:12.754 --> 00:13.670
Teo's mom died.

00:13.755 --> 00:15.372
It was an ALC bomb.

00:15.456 --> 00:16.590
What are we
looking for exactly?

00:16.657 --> 00:18.792
Anything that doesn't
belong in a jungle.

00:18.843 --> 00:22.162
Henry's been having secret
meetings with ALC rebels.

00:22.213 --> 00:24.047
Calder's almost certainly
working for Henry.

00:24.132 --> 00:26.266
By the way, I'm keeping you
in the NOC.

00:26.333 --> 00:27.884
Don't wanna waste a good cover.

00:27.969 --> 00:30.437
You're gonna move into a new
apartment at Kalorama Heights.

00:30.504 --> 00:33.557
It's like we have never
had time for us.

00:33.641 --> 00:35.108
So is that it?

00:35.176 --> 00:38.695
Is this...the end?

00:38.780 --> 00:41.698
I guess so.

01:45.963 --> 01:47.764
Hey.

01:47.849 --> 01:50.183
Hey.

01:50.251 --> 01:51.434
What are you doing here?

01:51.519 --> 01:53.520
May I come in?
Please?

01:53.587 --> 01:55.522
Sure.

02:01.562 --> 02:02.762
I've got our next mission.

02:02.813 --> 02:04.597
I've been thinking
about the photograph

02:04.649 --> 02:06.316
of Henry and Eduardo
in the jungle

02:06.400 --> 02:08.434
and what the best play
would be.

02:08.485 --> 02:10.152
It's gotta be off book, but--

02:10.238 --> 02:11.154
Wait, Auggie.

02:11.239 --> 02:13.773
You wanna keep
working together?

02:13.824 --> 02:15.441
Of course.
We're great together.

02:15.493 --> 02:17.077
But everything...

02:17.128 --> 02:20.413
is gonna be different.

02:20.464 --> 02:23.633
Only if we make it different.

02:23.718 --> 02:25.969
I have some new intelligence

02:26.053 --> 02:28.054
and an idea on how we can
use it to get to Henry.

02:28.122 --> 02:31.558
Can I show you?
Sure.

02:31.625 --> 02:34.127
There's a couch to your right

02:34.178 --> 02:35.679
with a coffee table
in front of you.

02:35.763 --> 02:37.681
Great.

02:44.071 --> 02:46.139
Okay.

02:46.190 --> 02:48.474
Take a look.

02:51.245 --> 02:54.197
Is that the CCTV feed
in Edinburgh?

02:54.282 --> 02:55.615
Yes, it is.

02:55.666 --> 02:58.335
The U.K. has the most advanced
camera system in the world.

02:58.419 --> 03:00.370
Even the CIA
can't get into it.

03:00.454 --> 03:02.488
Yeah, well, the CIA
didn't have a little bird

03:02.540 --> 03:03.673
working for 'em until now.

03:03.758 --> 03:05.592
Project Hummingbird?

03:05.659 --> 03:07.377
You got through
the U.K. firewalls?

03:07.461 --> 03:09.679
Oh, I got through
all the firewalls.

03:09.764 --> 03:13.099
Hummingbird links up with the
entire CCTV network in Europe.

03:13.167 --> 03:16.186
It syncs up seamlessly with
our facial recognition deck.

03:16.270 --> 03:20.506
Auggie, this is
a huge accomplishment.

03:20.558 --> 03:22.842
Thank you.

03:31.035 --> 03:32.953
So what does--what does that
have to do with the photo?

03:33.020 --> 03:35.021
Answer this.

03:35.072 --> 03:37.407
Who's the best person
to ask Eduardo

03:37.491 --> 03:38.908
what he and Henry were up to?

03:38.993 --> 03:40.744
Teo.

03:40.828 --> 03:42.862
Fifth picture.

03:42.913 --> 03:45.865
It's my beta test case.

03:49.220 --> 03:53.223
Are you deciding whether
to say yes or how to say no?

03:53.307 --> 03:57.310
I'm just...planning
my approach.

03:57.378 --> 03:59.062
So you'll do it.

03:59.146 --> 04:00.897
Yeah.

04:00.982 --> 04:02.899
Hmm.

04:04.852 --> 04:07.387
Obviously,
Teo is a moving target

04:07.438 --> 04:08.721
so follow my lead.

04:08.773 --> 04:10.573
Which takes me where?

04:10.658 --> 04:12.659
Northwest one.
Target Braga.

04:12.726 --> 04:13.827
He was last tracked

04:13.894 --> 04:15.412
near the castle's
northwest pavilion.

04:15.496 --> 04:19.666
He should be headed your way.

04:19.733 --> 04:22.669
Okay, hold on.

04:37.802 --> 04:40.753
I've got him.

04:52.483 --> 04:54.651
Keep tabs
on the interior cameras.

04:54.735 --> 04:56.669
All right, checking right now.

04:56.737 --> 04:59.656
Great room one.
Target Braga, identified.

05:04.328 --> 05:05.462
Auggie.

05:05.546 --> 05:08.465
He hit the first camera
in the great room.

05:11.719 --> 05:13.553
Great room 2.
Target Walker, identified.

05:13.620 --> 05:15.621
Okay, hold on, Annie.
You went too far.

05:15.673 --> 05:16.890
You passed the second camera.

05:16.957 --> 05:20.510
If he'd have done that
I'd have got him.

05:20.594 --> 05:22.562
- Did he go up the stairs?
- Nope.

05:22.629 --> 05:25.815
The camera on the landing
would have picked him up.

05:25.900 --> 05:28.518
Well, what else have you got?

05:28.602 --> 05:30.820
He's not here and there's
about a hundred other places

05:30.905 --> 05:31.938
he could have gone.

05:31.989 --> 05:35.692
Tunnel one.
Target Braga, identified.

05:35.776 --> 05:37.193
Got him.
He's in the tunnels.

05:37.278 --> 05:38.194
How'd he get
from here to there?

05:38.279 --> 05:39.195
I don't know,

05:39.280 --> 05:40.813
but there has to be a way.

05:40.865 --> 05:43.816
I'll access
the sub-basement map.

05:49.156 --> 05:51.958
Huh.

05:52.009 --> 05:54.677
I got him.

05:54.762 --> 05:56.329
Something about this
doesn't feel right.

05:56.380 --> 05:58.932
Are you sure these tunnels
eventually lead to an exit?

05:58.999 --> 06:00.133
It takes a while, but yeah.

06:00.184 --> 06:02.001
Okay, I can go right or left.

06:02.052 --> 06:05.004
Go right, into the tunnels.

06:11.612 --> 06:15.532
Tunnel one.
Target Walker, identified.

06:24.992 --> 06:27.911
There's a crawlspace
off to my right.

06:29.713 --> 06:32.715
Okay, here's
what you're gonna do.

06:44.145 --> 06:45.842
We need to talk.

06:54.347 --> 06:55.880
What brings you to Edinburgh?

06:56.152 --> 06:57.770
How did you find me?

06:57.854 --> 06:59.271
Tell me what brings you here

06:59.355 --> 07:01.740
and I'll tell you
how I found you.

07:01.825 --> 07:04.326
I was picking up some intel.

07:04.557 --> 07:07.559
A lead about
which port in Europe

07:07.611 --> 07:10.246
those missiles are being
smuggled out of.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.914
Your turn.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.333
We have a new
tracking technology.

07:14.401 --> 07:15.868
"We?"

07:15.919 --> 07:17.069
Whether you like it or not,

07:17.120 --> 07:18.120
you're part of a bigger team.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.755
And it'll be easier on all of us

07:19.840 --> 07:22.208
if you accept that
as a benefit and not a curse.

07:22.259 --> 07:25.761
My curse is being related
to a member of your team,

07:25.846 --> 07:27.513
so good luck.

07:27.580 --> 07:30.600
Look, Eduardo
won't talk to us.

07:30.684 --> 07:33.014
Your ALC brother has survived
weeks of interrogation

07:33.015 --> 07:34.465
without saying a word.
Hmm.

07:34.516 --> 07:36.150
We think he'll speak to you.

07:36.235 --> 07:37.602
What do you want us
to talk about?

07:37.653 --> 07:39.773
We have intel that he had
a meeting with Henry Wilcox.

07:39.805 --> 07:41.806
Maybe to buy those missiles.

07:41.857 --> 07:44.192
No.You said it yourself.

07:44.276 --> 07:45.576
He was my brother.

07:45.644 --> 07:47.812
He wouldn't have done any deal
without telling me.

07:47.863 --> 07:52.000
Did you tell him everything
about yourself?

07:52.084 --> 07:54.869
Like I said,
I have my own lead to follow.

07:54.953 --> 07:56.170
And I won't abandon that

07:56.255 --> 07:58.122
just because Arthur
wants another plan.

07:58.173 --> 08:02.326
You are so angry you can't see
that he is trying to save you.

08:02.378 --> 08:03.678
Save me?

08:03.762 --> 08:06.330
He paid me off
to cover his guilt.

08:06.382 --> 08:07.498
And that's the problem.

08:07.549 --> 08:10.501
He wants to see you.

08:17.226 --> 08:19.060
These photos
just landed on my desk.

08:19.144 --> 08:22.012
That's Annie in Vienna
five weeks ago

08:22.064 --> 08:23.731
when she's supposed to be
running a mission for me.

08:23.816 --> 08:26.367
Are you suggesting
she didn't?

08:26.452 --> 08:28.036
She's with one of the most
dangerous terrorists

08:28.120 --> 08:29.320
in Colombia.

08:29.371 --> 08:31.622
A detail she conveniently left
out of her report.

08:31.690 --> 08:32.811
What am I supposed to think?

08:32.857 --> 08:33.957
Why don't you ask her?

08:34.025 --> 08:35.293
Oh, I intend to.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.693
But I'd like
those questions to occur

08:36.745 --> 08:38.212
in a more formal setting.

08:38.297 --> 08:41.365
Opening an official
investigation

08:41.417 --> 08:44.085
into one of your operatives
is a very serious matter.

08:44.169 --> 08:45.536
I'd have to tell the DCI.

08:45.587 --> 08:48.723
Then tell him.

08:48.807 --> 08:52.060
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention, Calder.

08:52.144 --> 08:55.063
I'll handle it from here.

08:58.567 --> 09:02.687
Those photos will end up
in a burn bag, won't they?

09:02.738 --> 09:04.739
Excuse me?

09:04.823 --> 09:08.058
I want what's best
for my department.

09:08.110 --> 09:10.060
And I believe there's
malfeasance here.

09:10.112 --> 09:12.613
So if you don't want me
to investigate Annie

09:12.698 --> 09:16.451
for whatever reason,

09:16.535 --> 09:18.903
I'd like to investigate
Teo Braga.

09:18.954 --> 09:21.672
Investigate him
for what, exactly?

09:21.740 --> 09:23.591
I don't know, Joan.
Being in Vienna.

09:23.675 --> 09:26.677
An ALC member of his stature

09:26.745 --> 09:28.846
being outside of Colombia
is something to note,

09:28.914 --> 09:30.932
so I'd like to speak
with a comrade of his

09:31.016 --> 09:33.267
we have in custody,
Eduardo Vargas.

09:33.352 --> 09:36.721
Other departments are handling
the interrogation of Eduardo.

09:36.772 --> 09:38.356
He is not a DPD prisoner.

09:38.423 --> 09:40.608
He's my prisoner,
I captured him myself.

09:40.692 --> 09:42.310
When you were station chief
at Medellin.

09:42.394 --> 09:44.195
Now you're head of the DPD.

09:44.262 --> 09:47.264
Above my clearance
and out of my purview?

09:47.316 --> 09:48.699
That's really the card
you're playing?

09:48.767 --> 09:49.767
I'm not playing a card.

09:49.818 --> 09:51.119
I'm clarifying your role.

09:51.203 --> 09:52.570
To pursue domestic matters?

09:52.621 --> 09:53.988
- Yes.
- Yeah.

09:54.072 --> 09:55.490
That's what I'm trying to do,

09:55.574 --> 09:59.610
but my boss is playing favorites
with one of my operatives.

09:59.661 --> 10:02.547
You seem to be getting stuck
on this one issue, Calder.

10:02.614 --> 10:06.784
So, let's remove the problem,
shall we?

10:06.835 --> 10:10.120
Annie Walker no longer
works in your department.

10:10.172 --> 10:11.589
I'll transfer her out.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.174
Now you can turn
your attention

10:13.258 --> 10:16.177
to other matters
of DPD concern.

10:17.796 --> 10:21.766
Okay.

10:21.817 --> 10:24.769
I certainly will.

10:54.299 --> 10:57.167
Hello, Teo.

10:57.219 --> 10:59.971
Thank you for being a part
of this mission.

11:00.022 --> 11:01.022
What do you want?

11:01.106 --> 11:02.390
I've been worried about you.

11:02.474 --> 11:05.026
You don't get to play
the victim here.

11:05.110 --> 11:08.479
Oh, I'm not asking you for that.

11:08.530 --> 11:11.115
You know, I was doing fine

11:11.182 --> 11:13.401
until you sent her
and Auggie down to find me.

11:13.485 --> 11:14.986
- No, Teo, he didn't send--
- I didn't send them

11:15.037 --> 11:16.037
to find you.

11:16.121 --> 11:17.401
You can't help yourself,
can you?

11:17.406 --> 11:20.858
You have to play God with
everyone else's life

11:20.909 --> 11:23.078
and then you disappear into
the cloud when you're done.

11:23.079 --> 11:25.580
Right?

11:25.664 --> 11:28.249
- Is that how you see me?
- Yes.

11:28.334 --> 11:32.721
You're the worst mistake
my mother ever made.

11:32.805 --> 11:37.475
You may be right.

11:37.543 --> 11:39.978
What happened to her
haunts me every day.

11:40.045 --> 11:42.013
What happened to you
haunts me every day.

11:42.064 --> 11:44.099
All I wanted
was for you to be with me.

11:44.183 --> 11:45.900
I didn't see you for years.

11:45.985 --> 11:47.819
Oh, Teo, you were so young.

11:47.886 --> 11:49.020
After your mother died,

11:49.071 --> 11:52.407
I wanted to bring you
to Washington with me.

11:52.491 --> 11:53.825
But I was shut out.

11:53.892 --> 11:56.277
Don't you dare blame
my grandparents for that.

11:56.362 --> 11:58.329
You wanted to go
on a suicide mission.

11:58.397 --> 12:00.198
I couldn't let that happen.

12:00.249 --> 12:01.489
So I made sure
you had training.

12:01.534 --> 12:03.234
You had support.
A-a lifeline.

12:03.285 --> 12:04.786
What do you want me to say?
Thanks?

12:04.870 --> 12:06.254
No.
I'm not looking for thanks.

12:06.338 --> 12:08.456
- You want to protect me.
- Yes.

12:08.541 --> 12:09.591
I want you to leave me alone.

12:09.675 --> 12:10.842
That's what I want.

12:10.909 --> 12:12.961
I want you
to stay out of my life.

12:13.045 --> 12:16.548
No.

12:16.599 --> 12:18.099
I'm not leaving this time.

12:18.184 --> 12:21.636
If you want--
I want...

12:21.720 --> 12:23.855
everything to be different.

12:23.922 --> 12:25.807
I do too.

12:25.891 --> 12:29.360
It's too late for that.

12:29.428 --> 12:33.598
You made me a spy.

12:33.649 --> 12:35.984
And I have a mission.

12:47.797 --> 12:50.999
Good luck tomorrow, Annie.

12:51.083 --> 12:52.133
Thanks.

12:52.218 --> 12:56.137
And...thank you.

13:17.150 --> 13:18.517
We followed
all the protocols.

13:18.568 --> 13:20.885
No one saw us and no one would
think to look for us here.

13:20.937 --> 13:22.887
It's a perfectly safe place
to spend the night.

13:22.939 --> 13:26.274
Maybe you can
let your guard down,

13:26.359 --> 13:28.026
but I can't.

13:28.077 --> 13:29.661
I'm not letting
my guard down.

13:29.728 --> 13:32.664
I just trust
the precautions we took.

13:36.752 --> 13:37.786
Teo.

13:37.870 --> 13:39.904
I don't wanna
talk about my father.

13:39.956 --> 13:42.907
I didn't ask.

13:42.959 --> 13:46.244
I can feel you thinking
about how to bring it up.

13:49.582 --> 13:52.767
I know not to come
between a father and son.

13:52.852 --> 13:57.088
Yeah, right.

13:57.140 --> 13:59.558
What's so funny?

13:59.609 --> 14:04.429
You're still so devoted
to Auggie and my father

14:04.480 --> 14:06.198
after they lied to you.

14:06.265 --> 14:07.782
He didn't lie to me.

14:07.867 --> 14:10.785
Who?
Auggie or my father?

14:14.907 --> 14:17.659
It's complicated.

14:17.743 --> 14:22.113
And for people like us,

14:22.165 --> 14:25.083
there are always gonna
be things that we can't share.

14:25.134 --> 14:30.505
You've never done deep cover
work, have you?

14:30.590 --> 14:34.676
Where you have to become someone
else for a long time.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.311
No.

14:36.395 --> 14:40.565
Well, I think that's the
hardest thing a spy has to do.

14:40.633 --> 14:45.570
When I joined the ALC,
I hated those men.

14:47.973 --> 14:50.358
But then we grew up together.

14:50.443 --> 14:53.612
We raised ourselves.

14:53.663 --> 14:58.700
We saved each other's life
many times...

14:58.784 --> 15:01.319
that at the end...

15:01.370 --> 15:05.823
We became brothers.

15:05.875 --> 15:08.343
Are you
having second thoughts?

15:08.427 --> 15:12.130
No.

15:12.181 --> 15:14.432
I was trained for this.

15:14.500 --> 15:18.520
It's just
that sometimes I wish

15:18.604 --> 15:20.805
I could save them all.

15:20.856 --> 15:22.891
You know?

15:25.895 --> 15:28.680
Anyway...

15:28.731 --> 15:30.198
Let's do th--
Teo.

15:30.283 --> 15:31.316
- Come on.
- We don't have to do this.

15:31.367 --> 15:32.317
I brought a makeup kit.

15:32.368 --> 15:33.535
It'll work just as well.

15:33.619 --> 15:34.852
No, you have to hit me.

15:34.904 --> 15:36.871
It has to look real.

15:36.956 --> 15:40.542
Come on.

15:40.626 --> 15:42.627
Okay.

15:42.695 --> 15:43.628
Ready?

15:43.696 --> 15:46.248
Okay?
Mmhmm.

15:46.332 --> 15:49.167
Come on.

16:11.607 --> 16:13.074
Hello, Teo.

16:13.159 --> 16:14.693
Hello.

16:14.744 --> 16:16.444
I'm Joan Campbell.

16:16.529 --> 16:18.079
I know who you are.

16:18.164 --> 16:20.415
Nice to meet you.

16:20.499 --> 16:22.917
You too.

16:23.002 --> 16:24.569
When's the baby due?

16:24.620 --> 16:27.238
Uh, December.

16:27.290 --> 16:30.008
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

16:30.075 --> 16:31.926
It was unexpected.

16:32.011 --> 16:34.846
Like a lot of things
that have happened recently.

16:34.913 --> 16:37.081
- Do you need to sit?
- Uh, no.

16:37.133 --> 16:38.583
I'm not gonna stay.

16:38.634 --> 16:42.754
Lost River recently added
a new security measure.

16:42.805 --> 16:43.772
Transferring a detainee

16:43.856 --> 16:45.140
now requires a signed letter

16:45.224 --> 16:47.442
from the DCS, so here.

16:47.526 --> 16:48.977
And can I talk to you outside?

16:49.061 --> 16:51.029
Uh, yeah.

16:51.096 --> 16:53.732
And, Teo,
I wanted to say thank you

16:53.783 --> 16:55.433
for everything
you've done for us.

16:55.484 --> 16:57.619
I wish you
could have worked with me.

16:57.703 --> 17:01.623
I didn't get
to decide those terms.

17:13.669 --> 17:17.472
You know, I was very angry
with your father too.

17:17.556 --> 17:20.224
But he did do
all of this to protect you.

17:20.291 --> 17:23.228
To protect his secret.

17:25.815 --> 17:29.150
Well, I'm not gonna
make any excuses for him.

17:29.235 --> 17:33.071
And you know,
there is a way to move forward.

17:33.138 --> 17:35.473
You're very talented.

17:35.524 --> 17:36.858
The Agency would embrace
whatever project

17:36.942 --> 17:38.743
you wanted to pursue.

17:38.811 --> 17:40.445
When you come back,
we could sit down

17:40.496 --> 17:43.448
and talk about
what that could be.

17:45.284 --> 17:47.619
What do you think?

17:50.155 --> 17:51.172
Okay.

17:51.257 --> 17:53.842
Okay.

17:53.926 --> 17:56.845
I look forward to it.

17:58.347 --> 18:01.299
Good luck, Teo.

18:02.601 --> 18:05.520
Good luck to you too.

18:22.621 --> 18:25.240
He has Arthur's eyes.

18:26.826 --> 18:29.744
I was not expecting that.

18:31.580 --> 18:33.798
Listen, I need to update you
about something.

18:33.866 --> 18:36.868
I transferred you
out of the DPD.

18:36.919 --> 18:38.386
From now on,
all your case files

18:38.471 --> 18:41.139
are outside Calder's clearance.

18:41.206 --> 18:42.373
Where'd you transfer me to?

18:42.425 --> 18:43.905
There are some options
we can discuss,

18:43.976 --> 18:45.310
but for now,
you work for me.

18:45.377 --> 18:47.729
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:47.813 --> 18:49.881
Call me from Indiana.

18:49.932 --> 18:51.883
Drive safe.

19:07.733 --> 19:09.834
Are you ready?

19:09.902 --> 19:11.569
I'm ready.

19:12.738 --> 19:14.071
Are you okay?

19:14.123 --> 19:15.373
Yeah, I'll be fine.

19:15.424 --> 19:16.841
I just don't enjoy this.
No worries.

19:16.909 --> 19:18.460
Just pretend I'm Henry Wilcox.

19:18.544 --> 19:20.295
Just hit me.

19:20.379 --> 19:23.748
Do it.

19:23.799 --> 19:27.251
Mm.

19:27.603 --> 19:30.738
We can do better than that.

19:30.823 --> 19:32.740
Just hit me higher.

19:32.825 --> 19:34.058
We need a black eye.

19:34.109 --> 19:36.060
Hit me.

19:39.331 --> 19:42.250
As hard as you can, hit me.

19:45.788 --> 19:48.706
Ahh, yeah.

19:48.757 --> 19:51.626
That's what I'm talking about.

19:51.710 --> 19:53.628
Oh, nice.

20:37.472 --> 20:39.140
Martina, my love.

20:39.224 --> 20:40.558
Hello, Calder.

20:40.625 --> 20:43.127
You finally ready
for that rematch?

20:43.178 --> 20:44.846
Hmm, maybe if we use
my deck of cards.

20:44.930 --> 20:47.765
Mm, a weak craftsman
blames the tools.

20:47.816 --> 20:48.933
What do you need?

20:48.984 --> 20:52.303
Well, I'm going above my
clearance here.

20:52.354 --> 20:54.471
Yeah, I got that from
"Martina, my love."

20:54.523 --> 20:55.973
Hmm.

20:56.024 --> 20:59.944
How do I find out where
Eduardo Vargas is being held?

20:59.995 --> 21:01.812
Wait, didn't you capture him?

21:01.864 --> 21:04.448
Welcome to my world,
Martina.

21:04.499 --> 21:06.117
Well, he's not in Colombia.

21:06.168 --> 21:07.368
I can tell you that much.

21:07.452 --> 21:09.420
Okay.

21:09.487 --> 21:11.822
There's no one up there that
you can flirt with for intel?

21:11.874 --> 21:14.008
You know, I am hurt you think
I only flirt with you for intel.

21:14.092 --> 21:18.495
But, no, this place is held
together with red tape.

21:18.547 --> 21:21.265
Oh, I'll have to ask around,
carefully and quietly.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.885
Okay.
I owe you.

21:23.969 --> 21:25.169
Yes, you do.

21:25.220 --> 21:27.171
Talk soon.

23:29.953 --> 23:31.203
Annie Walker.

23:31.270 --> 23:32.631
I'm here
for the prisoner transfer.

23:32.706 --> 23:34.156
No detainees
leave the facility

23:34.240 --> 23:36.959
without written authorization
from the DCS.

23:37.043 --> 23:38.994
Here it is.

23:39.079 --> 23:41.997
And your credentials, please.

23:49.889 --> 23:52.758
Where's the prisoner's
final destination?

23:52.809 --> 23:55.094
Grey Wolf detention facility,
Jasper, Indiana.

23:55.145 --> 23:56.895
And what's his ID number
for cross check?

23:56.963 --> 23:58.847
Echo Victor
four four one eight.

23:58.932 --> 24:00.849
Okay.

24:28.294 --> 24:30.212
Key.

24:33.499 --> 24:35.718
Watch your head.

25:18.218 --> 25:20.636
Calder Michaels,
head of the DPD.

25:20.704 --> 25:22.472
I need to speak
to the administrator

25:22.539 --> 25:25.475
of this cell block immediately.

25:35.218 --> 25:36.185
Hi.

25:36.236 --> 25:37.487
Thank you.

25:37.554 --> 25:38.821
We need some time with these.

25:38.889 --> 25:40.606
I just went over all these
with your colleague.

25:40.691 --> 25:41.858
Is there a problem?

25:41.909 --> 25:42.892
You're leaving our facility
with a detainee.

25:42.943 --> 25:45.895
Triple check.
Thanks.

26:06.266 --> 26:07.683
- Cleared.
- Okay.

26:07.751 --> 26:10.686
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

26:22.232 --> 26:23.900
So, what can I do
for Langley.

26:23.951 --> 26:25.701
I'd like to speak
to one of your detainees,

26:25.769 --> 26:26.953
Eduardo Vargas.

26:27.037 --> 26:28.738
Please show me to his cell.

26:28.789 --> 26:29.939
Well,
that's gonna be a problem.

26:29.990 --> 26:31.290
He was just transferred out.

26:31.375 --> 26:35.211
- Who ordered that?
- The DCS herself.

26:35.278 --> 26:37.497
When was he transferred?

26:37.581 --> 26:38.631
You just missed him.

26:38.715 --> 26:39.882
Excuse me?

26:39.950 --> 26:41.584
Just a minute ago,
Mr. Michaels.

26:41.635 --> 26:44.587
What is going on here?

27:40.310 --> 27:42.228
Teo.

31:36.557 --> 31:38.341
The engine is smoking.

31:38.426 --> 31:41.311
I gotta get you out of here.

31:41.395 --> 31:43.230
Darn, I think it jammed
in the crash.

31:46.767 --> 31:48.268
What's that?

31:48.319 --> 31:50.237
I think he came back for us.

31:50.304 --> 31:53.273
Just get him out first.

31:53.324 --> 31:56.993
Find out everything he knows
about the bombing in Turbaco.

31:57.078 --> 31:58.028
Go.
Are you crazy?

31:58.112 --> 32:01.031
I've almost got this.

32:03.451 --> 32:05.669
Here, take this.

32:05.753 --> 32:08.672
Unlock him and I'll cover you.

32:41.372 --> 32:42.872
He's shooting at the gas tank.

32:42.957 --> 32:44.074
We gotta get out of here.

32:44.158 --> 32:45.208
I won't go without him.

32:45.293 --> 32:48.211
He has to answer my questions.

32:50.331 --> 32:52.716
Just...hold on!

32:52.800 --> 32:54.884
Teo, you have to
get out of there.

32:54.969 --> 32:57.087
He has to answer my questions.

32:57.171 --> 32:59.472
He has to tell me about Turbaco.

32:59.540 --> 33:03.426
Just hold on!

33:03.511 --> 33:06.346
Teo, come on!

33:08.349 --> 33:09.266
Teo, come on.

33:09.350 --> 33:12.269
Come on!

33:15.356 --> 33:17.274
Come on.

33:52.526 --> 33:54.110
Who was that man?

33:54.195 --> 33:55.612
I've never seen him before.

33:55.696 --> 33:58.865
We can put his description in
the database when we get back.

33:58.932 --> 34:01.151
I'm not going back.

34:01.235 --> 34:02.485
Teo!

34:02.570 --> 34:04.954
I know what the Plaza in Turbaco
means to you.

34:05.039 --> 34:07.073
I know it's where
your mother died.

34:07.124 --> 34:09.909
Don't do anything reckless.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.293
It's not reckless.

34:11.379 --> 34:13.946
I'm gonna put a bullet
in Henry Wilcox's head.

34:13.998 --> 34:15.799
That's not the way
I want this to end.

34:15.882 --> 34:18.251
If you do that, you can never
go back to Washington.

34:18.302 --> 34:20.553
You can never be a real part
of the Agency.

34:20.621 --> 34:23.639
You'll become the terrorist
he wants you to be.

34:23.724 --> 34:26.559
Don't let him win, Teo.

34:26.627 --> 34:29.962
You know what?
I joined the ALC

34:30.014 --> 34:32.399
because I want to know what
happened to my mother.

34:32.466 --> 34:36.636
Everything I have sacrificed
has been for that.

34:36.687 --> 34:40.489
And I can't stop now.

34:40.574 --> 34:43.493
I just can't.

34:53.838 --> 34:56.289
Tell my father I'm sorry.

34:56.340 --> 34:59.292
No, Teo.

35:15.339 --> 35:16.228
Yeah.

35:16.229 --> 35:17.664
Are you in Indiana already?

35:17.665 --> 35:19.982
No. Did you get my text
about the embassy in Bogota?

35:20.034 --> 35:21.951
Yes, I already called it in
to Bogota station.

35:22.002 --> 35:24.003
They're taking
all the necessary precautions.

35:24.088 --> 35:25.455
You sound terrible.
What happened?

35:25.506 --> 35:27.823
- Eduardo's dead.
- What?

35:27.875 --> 35:29.325
Some man ran us off the road.

35:29.376 --> 35:31.511
I've never seen him before,
but he was definitely trained.

35:31.595 --> 35:33.880
All right, if you can put
a description together--

35:33.964 --> 35:34.881
No, Joan, listen.

35:34.965 --> 35:36.382
My phone is going to die.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.384
We have to get to Henry
before Teo does.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.219
Can you double check the red
flags on his travel

35:40.304 --> 35:42.344
and can you pull the geo
coordinates off this phone?

35:42.389 --> 35:44.840
- Yes.
- Joan?

35:44.892 --> 35:46.109
Calder's here.

35:46.176 --> 35:50.113
Can you send someone
to come and get me please?

37:17.451 --> 37:19.101
Auggie?

37:19.153 --> 37:20.987
Auggie?

37:21.071 --> 37:22.905
Hey, Joan just called me.

37:22.956 --> 37:24.123
What the hell
happened out there?

37:24.208 --> 37:25.289
There's no time to explain.

37:25.292 --> 37:28.628
They're gonna
be here any minute.

37:28.712 --> 37:30.379
Who?

37:30.447 --> 37:32.465
You have to start wiping your
laptops and your hard drive--

37:32.549 --> 37:33.800
all your technology.

37:33.884 --> 37:35.251
Annie, what are you
talking about?

37:35.302 --> 37:40.089
I saw Calder at Lost River and
then someone tried to kill us.

37:40.140 --> 37:42.391
A CIA sweep team
ransacked my apartment.

37:42.459 --> 37:43.793
What does all that
add up to for you?

37:43.844 --> 37:47.647
Okay, I'm doing it right now.

37:47.731 --> 37:50.767
They're here.

37:53.804 --> 37:56.572
Auggie, it's Calder.

37:56.640 --> 37:57.573
You have to go.

37:57.641 --> 37:59.108
No, I can stay here.

37:59.159 --> 38:00.109
I can help you.

38:00.160 --> 38:01.277
I will be fine.

38:01.328 --> 38:04.280
You need to go now.

38:04.331 --> 38:06.332
Annie.

38:06.416 --> 38:09.035
I think Helen was wrong.

38:09.119 --> 38:10.670
About what?

38:10.754 --> 38:12.321
About everything.

38:12.372 --> 38:14.123
We made the wrong choice.

38:17.494 --> 38:19.545
Anderson?

38:19.630 --> 38:20.546
Damn it.

38:20.631 --> 38:23.549
Go this way.
Go, go, go.

38:28.505 --> 38:29.639
Go.
Get out of here.

38:29.690 --> 38:33.643
Open up, Anderson.

38:40.016 --> 38:41.367
Calder.

38:41.451 --> 38:42.985
I'm here on official business.

38:43.036 --> 38:44.954
I'd appreciate
your full cooperation.

38:45.021 --> 38:49.692
I'm not sure if that's
a threat or a request.

38:49.743 --> 38:50.877
Whichever one works for you.

38:50.961 --> 38:52.528
We'll be taking
your hard drives,

38:52.579 --> 38:54.914
your cell phone, your server,
your computers.

38:54.998 --> 38:57.917
Hell, we even gonna take
your alarm clock too.

38:58.001 --> 38:59.752
What is this regarding?

38:59.837 --> 39:01.804
I was recently reminded

39:01.872 --> 39:04.257
that I'm in charge of
supervising all domestic matters

39:04.341 --> 39:08.043
and that includes today's death
of a high-value detainee

39:08.095 --> 39:11.314
on U.S. soil.

39:11.398 --> 39:12.548
Am I supposed to say
something here?

39:12.599 --> 39:15.935
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

39:16.019 --> 39:16.986
Really?

39:17.053 --> 39:18.905
Aren't you and Annie Walker

39:18.989 --> 39:22.224
romantically involved?

39:22.276 --> 39:24.777
- Yes, we are.
- Yes.

39:24.862 --> 39:28.247
Well, she's at the center
of my investigation.

39:28.332 --> 39:30.666
So I need to know
what you know.

39:30.734 --> 39:32.952
Where's your safe, please?

39:33.036 --> 39:34.170
I don't have a safe.

39:34.237 --> 39:36.739
Aw, Auggie,
that's disappointing.

39:36.790 --> 39:37.924
Yeah, I know.

39:38.008 --> 39:40.927
I'm just gonna
have to take a look anyway.

39:48.585 --> 39:51.520
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?

39:55.142 --> 39:58.694
My job.

39:58.762 --> 40:00.062
I don't know what the hell
you and your girlfriend

40:00.113 --> 40:02.648
have been up to,
but I will not allow you

40:02.733 --> 40:04.951
to use my department
as your own private playground.

40:05.035 --> 40:07.737
It ends here.

40:07.788 --> 40:09.238
Calder.

40:09.289 --> 40:12.241
We got something.

40:14.110 --> 40:16.946
Now, would you
like to amend your answer,

40:16.997 --> 40:19.999
or do I gotta blast it open.

40:20.083 --> 40:21.584
It'd make a mess.

40:21.635 --> 40:23.586
Yeah, yeah.

41:02.826 --> 41:06.762
I recognize this flash drive
from the water damage.

41:06.830 --> 41:08.514
What should I bet
that it's the same one

41:08.598 --> 41:10.266
that's involved
in the FBI investigation

41:10.333 --> 41:12.101
into Seth Newman's death?

41:12.168 --> 41:14.003
I'm not a betting man.

41:14.054 --> 41:15.671
But you are.

41:15.722 --> 41:18.441
You bet that you could steal
evidence from the CIA,

41:18.508 --> 41:22.945
hide it in your personal safe,
and suffer no consequences.

41:23.013 --> 41:27.733
There will be lawyers, arrests,
and trials to be sure.

41:27.818 --> 41:28.985
But for now,

41:29.036 --> 41:30.369
you gonna come with me,

41:30.454 --> 41:33.372
we're gonna have
a little chat.
