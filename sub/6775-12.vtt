02:53.260 --> 02:55.296
I JUST REMEMBERED,
I OWE YOU MONEY.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.598
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR SPARING ME

02:57.600 --> 02:59.488
THE AWKWARD
CON FRONTATION.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.752
ARE YOU STARTING
TO FEEL EXPLOITED ?

03:01.760 --> 03:04.149
YEAH, BUT
IN A GOOD WAY.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.957
GO AHEAD.

03:09.700 --> 03:11.452
ARE YOU LOOKING
AT MY BALANCE ?

03:11.460 --> 03:12.791
IT'S OKAY.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.449
SIZE ISN'T
EVERYTHING.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.496
( music blaring )

03:16.500 --> 03:18.718
SO, DOES BAD MUSIC
MAKE PEOPLE DEAF,

03:18.730 --> 03:21.927
OR DO DEAF PEOPLE JUST HAVE
REALLY BAD TASTE IN MUSIC ?

03:21.930 --> 03:23.659
WELL, THERE
IS BEETHOVEN.

03:23.660 --> 03:25.321
HEY, COME ON,

03:25.330 --> 03:26.854
( thug )
WHAT THE FUCK

03:26.860 --> 03:28.191
I NEED MY RECEIPT,

03:28.200 --> 03:30.225
EH, EH, EH...

03:30.230 --> 03:31.492

03:31.500 --> 03:32.797
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO

03:32.800 --> 03:34.825
THAT KIND OF OFFENSIVE SHIT
LIKE THAT IN PUBLIC ?

03:34.830 --> 03:36.354
WE'RE SORRY,

03:36.360 --> 03:37.452
OH, HE'S SORRY.

03:40.260 --> 03:42.490

RUN, RUN... !

03:47.800 --> 03:49.654

03:50.930 --> 03:52.989

04:08.830 --> 04:11.048
COME ON,
LET'S GO.

04:28.860 --> 04:30.396
( Rico )
OKAY, HERE WE GO
WITH UNCLE NATE.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.458
YOU GOT HIM ?

04:31.460 --> 04:33.121
PUT YOUR HAND
UNDER THERE...

04:33.130 --> 04:35.155
THERE YOU GO,
WHOO, YES.

04:35.160 --> 04:38.095
OKAY, BUT DON'T HOLD HIM
LIKE HE'S A FOOTBALL.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.989
IT'S MORE LIKE YOU'RE
CARRYING A WATERMELON.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.228
SEE ?

04:42.230 --> 04:43.458
OKAY.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.058
HEY, THERE,
LITTLE GUY.

04:49.530 --> 04:50.929
( Ruth )
THEY SAY WHEN
A BABY'S BORN

04:50.930 --> 04:52.557
IT ALWAYS LOOKS
MORE LIKE ITS FATHER.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.597
WHICH IS NATURE'S WAY
OF ESTABLISHING PATERNITY.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.659
WE'RE HOPING
HE GROWS OUT OF IT.

04:57.660 --> 05:00.220
( Ruth )
OH, DON'T WORRY,
I'M SURE HE WILL.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.656
(Vanessa )
DAVID, COME
MEET AUGUSTO.

05:04.660 --> 05:07.197
I JUST HAVE TO, UH,
GET MR. PERLMUTI'ER

05:07.200 --> 05:08.656
DRESSED FOR
HIS VIEWING.

05:08.660 --> 05:09.695
AI, DAVID, PLEASE.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.224
COME TAKE ONE
LOOK AT HIM.

05:11.230 --> 05:13.323
( Ruth )
NATE WAS AN
EXTREMELY GASSY BABY,

05:13.330 --> 05:14.649
ALWAYS CRYING.

05:14.660 --> 05:17.220
DAVID, ON THE OTHER HAND,
HARDLY EVER MADE A PEEP.

05:19.300 --> 05:21.097
( Rico )
HEY, WHEN ARE YOU GUYS
GONNA GROW UP AROUND HERE

05:21.100 --> 05:22.795
AND MAKE THIS WOMAN
A GRANDMAMI ?

05:25.900 --> 05:27.856
WELL, CERTAINLY
NOT UNTIL AFTER

05:27.860 --> 05:29.748
MR. PERLMUTTER'S
GOT SOME CLOTHES ON.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.152
OHH...

05:45.160 --> 05:47.492
YOU KNOW,
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY,

05:47.500 --> 05:49.627
ME COMING BACK TO
SCHOOL IN A HEARSE.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.695
IT'S HILARIOUS.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.293
THIS SUCKS.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.495
DOES EVERYBODY KNOW ?

06:00.500 --> 06:03.355
I DON'T KNOW,
WHO'D YOU TELL ?

06:03.360 --> 06:05.351
NO, I MEAN, LIKE,

06:05.360 --> 06:09.057
DID THEY MAKE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT
OR SOMETHING ?

06:09.060 --> 06:11.358
DON'T YOU THINK YOU WOULD'VE
GO'ITEN A COUPLE OF CARDS

06:11.360 --> 06:14.124
OR SOMETHING,
IF THEY HAD ?

06:14.130 --> 06:16.098
NO.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.352
IT'S NOT COOL
TO O.D.

06:20.260 --> 06:22.524
WHO GIVES A FUCK WHAT
THESE PEOPLE THINK ?

06:22.530 --> 06:25.419
EVERYONE IS TOO OBSESSED
WITH WHAT EVERYONE ELSE
THINKS ABOUT THEM

06:25.430 --> 06:27.955
TO THINK ABOUT
ANYONE ELSE.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.394
YOU'RE A FREAK.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.960
YEAH, WELL,
SO ARE YOU.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.260
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO
MAKE ME FEEL BETI'ER ?

06:39.260 --> 06:41.353
( kids chattering )
THAT'S THE GUY WHO OD'ed ?

06:41.360 --> 06:44.420
( Claire )
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU LOOKING AT ?

06:51.530 --> 06:52.929
OH, SO WHAT,

06:52.930 --> 06:54.352
YOU CALLED ME OVER HERE
TO SHOW ME A PICTURE

06:54.360 --> 06:56.021
OF YOU AND
THE GRAVE DIGGER ?

06:56.030 --> 06:57.725
I NEED YOUR
KEY BACK.

06:57.730 --> 06:59.357
'CAUSE YOU'VE
CROSSED A LINE,

06:59.360 --> 07:01.749
AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I CAN TRUST YOU ANYMORE.

07:04.060 --> 07:05.618
YOU THINK I TOOK
THAT PICTURE ?

07:05.630 --> 07:07.518
I WILL NOT PLAY
THIS GAME WITH YOU !

07:11.930 --> 07:13.227
I'M NOT GONNA
DEAL WITH YOU

07:13.230 --> 07:15.255
WHEN YOU'RE OFF YOUR MEDS,
BILLY, BECAUSE,

07:15.260 --> 07:16.727
I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

07:16.730 --> 07:18.391
FOR SOMEONE WITH
SO MUCH ANIMOSITY

07:18.400 --> 07:19.992
TOWARDS
THE PSYCHIATRIC
PROFESSION,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.059
YOU SURE DO LOVE TO PUSH
THOSE PHARMACEUTICALS.

07:22.060 --> 07:23.721
MAKES SENSE, AS YOU'RE
OBVIOUSLY NO STRANGER

07:23.730 --> 07:25.220
TO MEDICATION YOURSELF.

07:25.230 --> 07:26.492
YOU'RE SICK, BILLY.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.354
AND YOU HAVE TO STAY
ON YOUR FUCKING MEDICATION

07:28.360 --> 07:30.555
OR YOU GET
SCARY, OKAY ?

07:30.560 --> 07:33.051
YOU'RE NOT
SCARED OF ME.

07:33.060 --> 07:35.620
I'D NEVER HURT YOU.

07:35.630 --> 07:37.450
YOU'RE THE MOST IMPORTANT
PERSON IN MY LIFE.

07:37.460 --> 07:39.155
YEAH, WELL DID YOU
EVER STOP TO THINK

07:39.160 --> 07:41.048
THAT MAYBE
THAT'S FUCKED UP ?

07:46.130 --> 07:47.688
I'M SORRY.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.554
DON'T BE SORRY,
JUST,

07:49.560 --> 07:51.448
JUST TAKE THE MEDS.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.524
OKAY, I PROMISE.

07:58.330 --> 08:00.093
NOW GIVE ME
THE KEY.

08:03.530 --> 08:06.226
I JUST TOLD YOU I'D TAKE
THE MEDICATION, BRENDA.

08:06.230 --> 08:08.858
I JUST TOLD YOU I'D
TAKE THE MEDICATION !

08:08.860 --> 08:11.522
JESUS CHRIST, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE SUCH A BITCH !

08:11.530 --> 08:13.521
WHEN DID YOU
TURN INTO MOM ?!

08:16.960 --> 08:19.497
OKAY, I DON'T
GIVE A SHIT,

08:19.500 --> 08:21.388
YOU WANT YOUR
FUCKING KEY ?

08:21.400 --> 08:24.198
GREAT, HERE, TAKE
ALL THE FUCKING KEYS.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.657
I COULD ALWAYS HAVE
AN EXTRA COPY AT HOME.

08:26.660 --> 08:28.525
YEAH, I CAN ALWAYS
CHANGE THE LOCKS.

08:28.530 --> 08:30.191
DO YOU KNOW HOW
EASY IT WOULD BE

08:30.200 --> 08:32.122
TO BREAK INTO
THIS PLACE ?

08:34.100 --> 08:36.295
I'D LIKE YOU
TO GO NOW.

08:36.300 --> 08:39.394
GET YOUR WET SUIT,
CLOTHING, ROBES,
TAKE THEM.

08:47.030 --> 08:49.954
I JUST TOLD YOU I'D TAKE
THE MEDICATION, BRENDA !

08:49.960 --> 08:52.599
I TOLD YOU I WOULD TAKE
THE MEDICATION, PLEASE.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.458
YOU HAVE TO TAKE
CARE OF YOURSELF NOW.

08:57.460 --> 09:00.395
I CAN'T DO IT,
NOT ANYMORE.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.129
PLEASE, BRENDA,

09:02.130 --> 09:03.791
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
I CAN TALK TO,

09:03.800 --> 09:05.654
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT HEARS ME, BRENDA.

09:05.660 --> 09:08.356
BILLY, YOU HAVE TO GET
A LIFE OF YOUR OWN, OKAY ?

09:08.360 --> 09:10.499
PLEASE.

09:27.630 --> 09:27.698
YOU PROBABLY
READ ABOUT IT,

09:30.130 --> 09:32.519
IT WAS ALL OVER THE NEWS,
WHAT HAPPENED TO MARC.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.657
YES.

09:34.660 --> 09:38.198
THE CORONERS...

09:38.200 --> 09:40.623
STILL HAS HIS,
THEY STILL HAVE HIM.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.692
IN SITUATIONS
LIKE THIS,

09:44.700 --> 09:47.055
WHEN THERE'S BEEN,
UH, VIOLENCE,

09:47.060 --> 09:50.928
THE FAMILY MAY PREFER
A CLOSED CASKET.

09:50.930 --> 09:51.999
NO.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.252
HONEY, I THINK
HE LOOKS PRE'ITY BAD.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.057
I HAVE TO SEE HIM.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.293
I BROUGHT
SOME PICTURES,

10:01.300 --> 10:03.689
SO, YOU'LL KNOW
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.

10:10.260 --> 10:12.797
WASN'T HE SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL BOY ?

10:17.700 --> 10:19.656
WHY DOES A THING
LIKE THIS HAPPEN ?

10:22.630 --> 10:24.757
COME ON, NOW, WE ALL
KNOW WHY THIS HAPPENED.

10:24.760 --> 10:26.819
THAT IS NOT
A REASON.

10:28.330 --> 10:30.696
IT'S THE
ONLY REASON.

10:30.700 --> 10:32.554
IF HE WASN'T...

10:36.900 --> 10:38.322
HE'D BE ALIVE TODAY.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.894
YOU KNOW, I WAS ALWAYS
SO WORRIED ABOUT AIDS.

10:42.900 --> 10:47.155
I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT
THAT JUST BEING OUT
ON THE STREET...

10:47.160 --> 10:50.618
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH PEOPLE ?

10:50.630 --> 10:52.325
I COULD'VE TOLD HIM
THIS KIND OF THING HAPPENS.

10:52.330 --> 10:54.298
I WOULD'VE, TOO,
IF HE'D EVER JUST,

10:54.300 --> 10:56.689
TALKED TO US ABOUT IT,
EVER COME OUT,

10:56.700 --> 10:59.191
AND TOLD US WHAT HE WAS.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.760
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
EXPECT, MARCUS ?

11:01.760 --> 11:03.796
YOU CAN'T EVEN SAY IT.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.921
( Rico singing
in Spanish )

11:20.230 --> 11:21.788
HEY, DAVE.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.756
I'LL BE RIGHT
WITH YOU.

11:28.100 --> 11:30.352
( Spanish )

11:35.900 --> 11:37.424
( David )
JESUS!

11:37.430 --> 11:38.988
( Rico )
WHOO BOY.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.524
OKAY, CINDERELLA.

11:40.530 --> 11:42.020
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO WORK OVERTIME

11:42.030 --> 11:43.895
TO GET YOU READY
FOR THE BALL.

11:43.900 --> 11:47.051
BECAUSE MEN DON'T MAKE PASSES
AT GIRLS WITH BIG GASHES.

11:47.060 --> 11:49.756
HA, HA, THAT WAS
FUNNY, RIGHT ?

11:49.760 --> 11:52.456
DADDY'S
MR. FUNNYMAN !

11:52.460 --> 11:54.451
LET ME JUST RUN
AUGUSTO UPSTAIRS

11:54.460 --> 11:57.224
AND I'LL BE RIGHT
BACK DOWN TO DO HIM.

11:57.230 --> 11:59.095
I CAN HANDLE
THIS, FEDERICO.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.250
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THE REST OF THE DAY OFF ?

12:01.260 --> 12:03.228
THAT'S A PRETTY
TOUGH JOB, DAVE.

12:03.230 --> 12:05.448
THE SKULL'S ALL
SHA'I'TERED UP THERE.

12:05.460 --> 12:07.098
AND YOU MIGHT HAVE TO
COMPLETELY REBUILD

12:07.100 --> 12:08.328
THE TISSUE
ON HIS CHEEK.

12:08.330 --> 12:09.820
I CAN DO IT.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.549
HEY, THAN KS, MAN.

12:12.560 --> 12:16.257
I'M SO DAMN TIRED
I CAN BARELY SEE STRAIGHT.

12:16.260 --> 12:18.251
GET SOME REST.

12:18.260 --> 12:19.955
YOU BET,
GOOD LUCK !

12:27.100 --> 12:29.819
AND I TOLD HIM NOT TO
COME AROUND FOR A WHILE.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.791
THAT'S IT ?

12:33.800 --> 12:35.722
WHAT ELSE COULD
I DO, NATE ?

12:35.730 --> 12:37.197
YOU COULD
TALK TO THE POLICE,

12:37.200 --> 12:38.895
YOU COULD GET
A RESTRAINING ORDER.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.925
I DON'T NEED YOU TO TELL ME
HOW TO HANDLE THIS.

12:40.930 --> 12:42.795
THAT IS SO ARROGANT
AND PATRONIZING.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.552
I JUST NEED YOU
TO LISTEN TO ME.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.255
BRENDA, YOU CAN'T
JUST SIT AROUND

12:46.260 --> 12:48.148
WAITING FOR THE NEXT
FUCKED UP THING
BILLY DOES.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.798
YOU NEED TO DO
SOMETHING NOW.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.451
DO YOU THINK THAT
WAS EASY FOR ME,

12:52.460 --> 12:54.155
JUST CUTTING HIM
OFF LIKE THAT ?

12:54.160 --> 12:55.923
DO YOU EVEN COMPREHEND
WHAT IT'S LIKE

12:55.930 --> 12:58.694
TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR
SOMEONE YOUR WHOLE LIFE ?

12:58.700 --> 13:00.327
DO YOU EVEN
GET THE CONCEPT

13:00.330 --> 13:03.299
OF LOVING SOMEBODY
THAT MUCH ?

13:03.300 --> 13:06.098
YES, I GET
THAT CONCEPT.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.022
HE'S SICK.

13:14.030 --> 13:17.124
HE'S NOT JUST SICK,
HE'S DANGEROUS.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.950
HE BUILT A BOMB.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.827
HE BROKE INTO OUR HOTEL ROOM
AND TOOK PICTURES OF US IN BED.

13:21.830 --> 13:23.457
WHAT'S HE GONNA
DO NEXT TIME ?

13:23.460 --> 13:25.599
I TOOK HIS KEY
AWAY FROM HIM.

13:25.600 --> 13:26.953
YEAH, WELL, HE DIDN'T
HAVE A KEY IN VEGAS,

13:26.960 --> 13:28.996
THAT DIDN'T
KEEP HIM OUT.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.059
I'M SORRY.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.698
I KNOW YOU DON'T
TRUST YOUR PARENTS,

13:32.700 --> 13:34.053
BUT I REALLY THINK
THEY'RE RIGHT ON THIS.

13:34.060 --> 13:35.652
HE NEEDS TO
BE SOMEWHERE.

13:41.200 --> 13:45.853
THIS IS SO NOT HOW
I NEED YOU TO BE RIGHT NOW.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.323
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

13:53.330 --> 13:55.696
I DON'T WANNA DISCUSS
THIS WITH YOU ANYMORE.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.224
IN FACT,
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

13:57.230 --> 13:59.698
WHY DON'T WE JUST
TAKE SOME TIME OFF ?

13:59.700 --> 14:01.224
WHAT IS THIS ?

14:01.230 --> 14:03.323
OH, YOU DUMP BILLY, SO
NOW YOU'RE GONNA DUMP ME ?

14:03.330 --> 14:05.355
DON'T YOU FUCKING
ANALYZE ME !

14:05.360 --> 14:07.157
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
TH ROW AWAY YOUR KEY,

14:07.160 --> 14:08.957
BECAUSE I CHANGED
THE LOCK.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.493
WHERE'S CLAIRE ?

14:25.500 --> 14:27.491
WELL, SHE CLAIMS
TO BE AT A MOVIE,

14:27.500 --> 14:29.889
BUT, WHAT DO I KNOW ?

14:29.900 --> 14:31.925
NOBODY EVERYBODY TELLS ME
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON.

14:36.260 --> 14:39.923
THAT BOY, WHO GOT
BEAT UP ON THE STREET...

14:41.560 --> 14:44.097
WAS HE DOING
SOMETHING ?

14:46.300 --> 14:49.622
HE WAS GETTING CASH,
DIDN'T YOU READ THE PAPER ?

14:49.630 --> 14:52.224
YES, I JUST THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT KNOW MORE ABOUT IT.

14:55.930 --> 14:57.659
DO YOU LIKE
THE HEN ?

14:57.660 --> 15:00.493
VERY MUCH, WHAT DID
YOU STUFF IT WITH ?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.821
CHESTNUTS,
BREAD CRUMBS, CELERY.

15:02.830 --> 15:05.628
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
ALL THE INGREDIENTS ?

15:05.630 --> 15:08.997
NO, THANKS.

15:12.900 --> 15:15.095
ARE YOU
GOING OUT TONIGHT ?

15:15.100 --> 15:17.227
NOT TONIGHT.

15:17.230 --> 15:19.551
ARE YOU ?

15:19.560 --> 15:22.120
ME ? NO.

15:22.130 --> 15:25.349
BUT, YOU KNOW,

15:25.360 --> 15:29.820
SOMETIMES I DO SEE
HIRAM ON OCCASION.

15:29.830 --> 15:32.253
AND, I KNOW
YOU DON'T LIKE THAT,

15:32.260 --> 15:36.219
BUT I ALSO KNOW
YOU LOVE ME NO MATTER

15:36.230 --> 15:38.027
WHO I SEE IN
MY PRIVATE LIFE.

15:42.630 --> 15:44.552
WELL, THAT'S GOOD, MOM.

15:54.900 --> 15:58.097
SO, WHY DID YOU
DROP JAZZ VOCALS
SOPHOMORE YEAR ?

16:00.060 --> 16:02.449
BECAUSE THE MUSIC TEACHER
WAS A CRACKHEAD.

16:02.460 --> 16:04.428
I'M SERIOUS, CLAIRE.

16:04.430 --> 16:05.624
SO AM I.

16:05.630 --> 16:06.927
HE GOT BUSTED
AND FIRED

16:06.930 --> 16:08.898
AND THEN JAZZ VOCALS
WAS DISCONTINUED.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.253
DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

16:14.130 --> 16:17.395
WHAT HAPPENED WITH
THE LITERARY MAGAZINE ?

16:17.400 --> 16:19.129
CENSORSHIP.

16:19.130 --> 16:21.951
I WROTE THIS TOTALLY,
LIKE, HARMLESS LIKE,

16:21.960 --> 16:23.848
CARTOON STORY
ABOUT THIS GIRL

16:23.860 --> 16:25.919
WHO CAN MAKE
PEOPLE'S HEADS EXPLODE,

16:25.930 --> 16:29.855
AND APPARENTLY IT WAS
TOO DISTURBING TO PUBLISH.

16:29.860 --> 16:31.851
THE DEBATE TEAM ?

16:31.860 --> 16:34.624
THEY DEBATED WHAT
THE PROM THEME SHOULD BE.

16:34.630 --> 16:36.655
I MEAN, GOD,
THE PEOPLE IN THIS SCHOOL.

16:36.660 --> 16:39.527
THEY HAVE THE MENTALITY
OF TEENAGERS.

16:39.530 --> 16:40.849
YOU ARE A TEENAGER.

16:40.860 --> 16:43.124
YES, BUT I ACTUALLY
THINK ABOUT THINGS

16:43.130 --> 16:45.155
BESIDE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

16:45.160 --> 16:48.527
HOW TO PUKE AFTER LUNCH
WITHOUT ANYONE NOTICING.

16:48.530 --> 16:51.590
SO, WHAT DO YOU
DO FOR FUN ?

16:51.600 --> 16:54.353
I DON'T KNOW.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.191
WHAT DO YOU
DO FOR FUN ?

16:56.200 --> 16:59.749
I GO BOWLING
WITH MY FRIENDS.

16:59.760 --> 17:02.228
I TAKE HIKES WITH
MY GIRLFRIEND.

17:02.230 --> 17:04.095
I BAKE.

17:04.100 --> 17:06.091
YOU BAKE ?

17:06.100 --> 17:08.227
YOUR TURN.

17:08.230 --> 17:10.152
I READ.

17:12.400 --> 17:17.258
I GO ONLINE AND MAKE UP
FREAKY CYBER IDENTITIES.

17:17.260 --> 17:19.626
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
I'M A SCIENTOLOGIST,

17:19.630 --> 17:23.521
SOMETIMES I'M A YOUNG,
CHRISTIAN WIFE.

17:23.530 --> 17:25.350
WHAT ABOUT
FRIENDSHIPS
THAT ARE,

17:25.360 --> 17:26.725
BASED ON THE TRUTH,
ANY OF THOSE ?

17:31.030 --> 17:34.249
SOMETIMES I HANG OUT
WITH PARKER MCKENNA,

17:34.260 --> 17:35.852
I KINDA LIKE HER.

17:35.860 --> 17:37.054
EVEN THOUGH
SHE'S PRETTY MUCH

17:37.060 --> 17:40.052
A SPLIT
PERSONALITY FREAK.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.994
DATING ANYONE ?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.423
DATING ?

17:44.430 --> 17:46.796
YOU MEAN LIKE GETTING
DRUNK AND SCREWING ?

17:46.800 --> 17:48.995
IF THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.025
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT IT IS,
NO, I'M NOT.

17:54.560 --> 17:56.289
KEITH, GOT
A MINUTE ?

17:56.300 --> 17:58.120
SURE.

17:58.130 --> 17:59.495
WHAT'S UP ?

17:59.500 --> 18:00.853
I WANNA PUT
YOU ON SECURITY

18:00.860 --> 18:02.999
FOR THE MARC FOSTER
FUNERAL ON THURSDAY.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.490
OKAY, WHY ?

18:04.500 --> 18:06.923
'CAUSE ALL OF THE WACKOS
TURN OUT FOR THESE THINGS.

18:06.930 --> 18:08.591
WHY ME ?

18:08.600 --> 18:10.249
COME ON, KEITH.

18:10.260 --> 18:11.693
BECAUSE YOU'RE
A GOOD, SMART COP

18:11.700 --> 18:14.453
AND YOU USE YOUR HEAD BEFORE
YOU USE YOUR GUN, ALRIGHT ?

18:14.460 --> 18:16.690
SO, IT HAS
NOTHING TO DO

18:16.700 --> 18:19.055
WITH THE FACT THAT
I'M GAY, RIGHT ?

18:19.060 --> 18:22.120
WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO, MAN,
SUE ME FOR DISCRIMINATION,

18:22.130 --> 18:24.826
OR SHOW UP AND PROTECT
THIS KID'S FAMILY ?

18:30.630 --> 18:32.222
( Marc laughing )

18:32.230 --> 18:34.255
OH, GOD,

18:34.260 --> 18:37.798
I LOOK LIKE SOMETHING
CHEF BOYARDEE MAKES.

18:37.800 --> 18:40.997
SO, YOU NEVER TOLD
YOUR PARENTS YOU
WERE GAY EITHER ?

18:41.000 --> 18:43.298
OH, PLEASE,
THEY KNEW.

18:43.300 --> 18:45.518
I JUST DIDN'T WANT
MY DAD MAKING ME FEEL GUILTY

18:45.530 --> 18:47.259
ABOUT IT
ALL THE TIME.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.228
MAYBE HE COULD
HAVE ACCEPTED IT

18:49.230 --> 18:51.391
IF YOU'D GIVEN
HIM A CHANCE.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.890
YOU HEARD HIM.

18:52.900 --> 18:55.357
HE THINKS IT'S
MY FAULT I'M DEAD.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.351
THAT'S NOT WHAT
HE WAS SAYING.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.248
HE WAS SAYING
IT'S A SICK WORLD.

18:59.260 --> 19:01.296
I'M THE ONE
WHO WAS SICK.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.824
SHUT UP.

19:02.830 --> 19:04.718
SO, I LIKED MEN.

19:04.730 --> 19:06.459
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
GIVEN IN TO IT.

19:06.460 --> 19:09.520
IT'S NOT WHAT
GOD INTENDED.

19:09.530 --> 19:11.054
I COULD HAVE
HAD A FAMILY,

19:11.060 --> 19:12.391
I COULD HAVE HAD
A NORMAL LIFE.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.594
YOU COULD'VE, TOO.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.090
THAT LIFE WOULD
HAVE BEEN A LIE,

19:15.100 --> 19:17.022
AND COMPLETELY UNFAIR
TO YOUR WIFE AND CHILDREN,

19:17.030 --> 19:18.952
WHO WOULD'VE HATED YOU.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.019
NOT IF I NEVER
LOOKED BACK.

19:21.030 --> 19:24.227
NOT IF I HAD FAITH.

19:24.230 --> 19:26.391
GOD CHALLENGES US
LIKE THIS,

19:26.400 --> 19:30.052
SO WE'LL CHOSE GOOD,
SO WE'LL TRIUMPH OVER EVIL.

19:30.060 --> 19:33.552
ONLY THING IS,
SO FEW OF US DO.

19:33.560 --> 19:36.051
IT'S NOT A CHOICE.

19:36.060 --> 19:38.358
GOD ALREADY MADE
THE CHOICE FOR YOU.

19:38.360 --> 19:39.998
THAT'S JUST LIBERAL
PROPAGANDA

19:40.000 --> 19:42.218
TO JUSTIFY YOUR
OWN DEPRAVITY.

19:42.230 --> 19:44.095
JIM.

19:44.100 --> 19:47.228
NO MATTER HOW NICE
YOU FIX ME UP,

19:47.230 --> 19:50.552
I'M STILL GOING TO HELL,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.427
'CAUSE YOU'RE
GOING THERE TOO.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.498
BRENDA, PICK UP
THE PHONE.

20:13.500 --> 20:16.321
DON'T JUST LAY THERE
AND SAY "FUCK YOU".

20:16.330 --> 20:19.128
OKAY, LOOK, I'M SORRY
I PISSED YOU OFF.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.757
I KNOW YOU'RE UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE

20:20.760 --> 20:23.149
BUT SO AM I.

20:23.160 --> 20:25.219
SO, LET'S TALK
ABOUT IT, OKAY ?

20:25.230 --> 20:26.891
CALL ME.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.027
( phone )

20:35.460 --> 20:37.553
HEY !

20:37.560 --> 20:40.859
UH, YES, THIS IS
FISHER & SONS,

20:40.860 --> 20:43.294
CAN I HELP YOU ?

20:43.300 --> 20:45.791
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

20:45.800 --> 20:50.191
YES, WE CAN PICK UP
THE BODY, UH, THE DECEASED.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.156
WHICH MORGUE ?

20:52.160 --> 20:55.323
OH, RESIDENCE, OKAY.

20:55.330 --> 20:57.389
WHAT'S THE ADDRESS ?

21:04.060 --> 21:05.493
ROBBIE ?

21:05.500 --> 21:07.525
OH, I'M SORRY,
DID MY TREE HIT YOU ?

21:07.530 --> 21:09.794
DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT ?

21:09.800 --> 21:11.290
WELL, I DON'T
KNOW, RUTH.

21:11.300 --> 21:13.120
I GOT A WHOLE BIG
BUNCH OF FERNS OUT BACK

21:13.130 --> 21:14.324
I GOTTA CUT UP

21:14.330 --> 21:15.957
SO YOU CAN MAKE
MORE OF THOSE

21:15.960 --> 21:18.622
BEAUTIFUL,
ONE-OF-A-KIND
ARRANGEMENTS.

21:18.630 --> 21:21.428
HOW DID YOU TELL
YOUR PARENTS YOU WERE...

21:21.430 --> 21:23.853
INTO FLOWERS ?

21:23.860 --> 21:26.021
WELL, IT WAS OBVIOUS
FROM THE BEGINNING.

21:26.030 --> 21:28.897
MY FIRST WORD
WAS PERENNIAL.

21:28.900 --> 21:32.996
HOW DID YOU TELL
THEM YOU WERE...

21:33.000 --> 21:34.592
GAY ?

21:34.600 --> 21:36.693
WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK I AM GAY ?

21:36.700 --> 21:38.895
JUST BECAUSE I HAVE
A REFINED AESTHETIC,

21:38.900 --> 21:40.492
YOU THINK YOU CAN
MAKE ASSUMPTIONS

21:40.500 --> 21:42.149
ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE ?

21:42.160 --> 21:44.355
I'M SO SORRY,
YOU'RE NOT GAY ?

21:44.360 --> 21:45.793
YES, I'M GAY.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.155
BUT I CERTAINLY
DON'T SEE

21:48.160 --> 21:50.799
HOW THAT'S ANY
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

21:50.800 --> 21:53.360
DO I ASK YOU ABOUT
YOUR INTIMATE SEXUAL LIFE,

21:53.360 --> 21:55.749
EVEN THOUGH IT IS ON
FULL DISPLAY IN THE WORKPLACE ?

21:55.760 --> 21:57.421
NO, I DO NOT.

21:57.430 --> 21:59.318
I TOLERATE
THE REPERCUSSIONS,

21:59.330 --> 22:00.957
BUT, I DON'T PRY.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.120
I'M SORRY.

22:02.130 --> 22:03.893
I'M ASKING
BECAUSE MY SON--

22:03.900 --> 22:08.098
OH, DEAR LORD,
SAVE IT FOR "GERALDO".

22:09.900 --> 22:12.619
SOMEONE IN THE FAMILY SHOWS
SIGNS OF HOMOSEXUALITY

22:12.630 --> 22:15.656
AND SUDDENLY IT'S
A NATIONAL CRISIS.

22:15.660 --> 22:17.127
COMING OUT
TO MY PARENTS,

22:17.130 --> 22:19.189
HONESTLY, WHY
DON'T YOU TELL ME

22:19.200 --> 22:23.352
THE MOST HORRIBLE MOMENT
FROM YOUR INTIMATE PAST ?

22:23.360 --> 22:24.588
IT WAS HORRIBLE ?

22:24.600 --> 22:28.388
IT'S NONE OF
YOUR BUSINESS.

22:28.400 --> 22:31.654
I'M SORRY
I OFFENDED YOU, ROBBIE.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.089
( groaning )

22:39.100 --> 22:41.295
THAT IS A SHITTY
PLACE FOR THE LILY.

22:48.430 --> 22:50.398
MR. JACOBY ?

23:52.400 --> 23:55.324
( music playing )

24:16.260 --> 24:19.593
( opera music playing )

24:48.800 --> 24:50.324
OH, FUCK.

24:51.660 --> 24:53.992
JESUS, BILLY,
YOU FUCKING PSYCHO.

25:16.330 --> 25:19.993
AHHH !

25:20.000 --> 25:21.422
DID I GET YOU ?

25:21.430 --> 25:23.648
COME ON, MAN,
IT'S PAINT.

25:23.660 --> 25:25.196
WHY AREN'T
YOU LAUGHING ?

25:25.200 --> 25:27.293
I DON'T THINK
IT'S FUNNY.

25:27.300 --> 25:29.097
NO, IT'S JUST
PLAIN FUN.

25:29.100 --> 25:30.829
YOU KNOW, IF YOU MIX UP
THE LETTERS IN "FUNERAL"

25:30.830 --> 25:33.048
YOU GET "REAL FUN".

25:33.060 --> 25:34.618
HOW MUCH DO YOU
LOVE THAT ?

25:39.230 --> 25:41.528
YOU STAY AWAY
FROM MY SISTER,

25:41.530 --> 25:42.849
SHE'S JUST A KID.

25:42.860 --> 25:44.555
THAT'S KINDA IRONIC,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

25:44.560 --> 25:45.697
YOU TELLING ME THAT.

25:51.930 --> 25:53.227
WHAT'D THEY
TELL YOU ?

25:58.660 --> 26:01.424
THEY TELL YOU
I MADE A BOMB ?

26:01.430 --> 26:04.649
DID THEY TELL YOU
WHO IT WAS FOR ?

26:04.660 --> 26:07.424
I KNOW YOU WROTE THINGS
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.

26:07.430 --> 26:09.227
LIAR !

26:10.800 --> 26:13.291
DON'T FUCKING
LIE TO ME.

26:13.300 --> 26:16.929
HE THOUGHT HE WAS
SUCH A GENIUS.

26:16.930 --> 26:18.659
EVERYBODY THOUGHT,
HE WAS SUPPOSED...

26:18.660 --> 26:19.991
HE EVEN HAD
BRENDA FOOLED.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.524
WHICH BLOWS MY MIND.

26:21.530 --> 26:23.293
WELL, OKAY,
SHE WAS YOUNG.

26:23.300 --> 26:25.825
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT DR. FEINBERG ?

26:25.830 --> 26:27.855
NO, TREVOR,
YOU FUCKING MORON.

26:27.860 --> 26:30.624
TREVOR, PERFECT
FUCKING, TREVOR.

26:30.630 --> 26:33.394
HE THOUGHT HE WAS
THE KING OF BRENDA,

26:35.900 --> 26:37.595
AS IF YOU COULD KNOW
SOMEBODY FOR, WHAT,

26:37.600 --> 26:38.919
A FEW MONTHS ?

26:38.930 --> 26:40.454
AND JUST REPLACE
THEIR WHOLE LIFE ?

26:40.460 --> 26:42.496
THEIR FAMILY ?

26:42.500 --> 26:44.491
BRENDA'S NOT ALLOWED
TO LOVE ANYONE

26:44.500 --> 26:46.422
AS MUCH AS
SHE LOVES YOU ?

26:46.430 --> 26:48.091
ABLE...

26:48.100 --> 26:49.920
SHE'S NOT ABLE.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.255
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

26:59.230 --> 27:01.494
BREN' NEVER EVEN
TOLD ME ABOUT TREVOR.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.127
SHE OBVIOUSLY
DOESN'T TRUST ME.

27:03.130 --> 27:04.654
YOU DON'T GET
TO CALL HER THAT !

27:04.660 --> 27:06.890
YOU CALL HER BRENDA.

27:06.900 --> 27:08.720
YOU KNOW,
SHE BROKE UP
WITH ME TODAY.

27:08.730 --> 27:10.891
REALLY ?

27:10.900 --> 27:13.892
YEAH, TOOK AWAY MY KEY.

27:33.130 --> 27:34.995
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY
FOR THE BEST.

27:37.430 --> 27:39.159
YOU AND BRENDA,

27:39.160 --> 27:41.651
WAS NEVER
A GOOD IDEA.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.419
YEAH, TELL ME
ABOUT IT.

27:46.430 --> 27:50.196
LISTEN, I GOTTA GO,
SO, YOU TAKE CARE.

28:09.330 --> 28:10.558
HEY.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.596
HEY.

28:12.600 --> 28:15.057
YOU READY TO GO ?

28:15.060 --> 28:17.153
YEAH, JUST,

28:17.160 --> 28:20.527
GIMME A SECOND
TO RECOVER.

28:20.530 --> 28:23.090
STILL BAD, HUH ?

28:23.100 --> 28:25.853
IT'S JUST
FUCKING TIRING

28:25.860 --> 28:27.828
TRYING TO ACT
NORMAL ALL DAY.

28:27.830 --> 28:30.424
I KNOW WHAT
YOU MEAN.

28:32.760 --> 28:35.126
SO, WHAT'S THE
STUPIDEST THING

28:35.130 --> 28:37.428
ANYONE'S SAID
TO YOU TODAY ?

28:37.430 --> 28:39.796
UMM, OH,

28:39.800 --> 28:42.018
PACKY WALKER
TOLD ME THAT

28:42.030 --> 28:44.157
HE ONCE HAD TO GET
HIS STOMACH PUMPED

28:44.160 --> 28:47.823
BECAUSE HE ATE HIS DOG'S
DE-WORMING PILLS.

28:47.830 --> 28:50.128
HE THOUGHT
THEY WERE 'LUDES.

28:52.460 --> 28:55.224
WELL, ISN'T IT
COMFORTING TO KNOW

28:55.230 --> 28:56.629
THAT BEING MISERABLE'S
STILL BETTER

28:56.630 --> 28:59.019
THAN BEING
AN IDIOT ?

28:59.030 --> 29:01.055
( alarm chirping )

29:22.830 --> 29:25.048
ALRIGHT.

29:25.060 --> 29:27.153
YOU WANNA HEAR THE
MOST HORRIBLE MOMENT

29:27.160 --> 29:28.923
FROM MY
INTIMATE PAST ?

29:28.930 --> 29:32.457
UH, NO, SISTER,
I DO NOT.

29:32.460 --> 29:35.452
I WAS MARRIED TO
MY HUSBAND FOR 30 YEARS

29:35.460 --> 29:38.327
AND I NEVER SLEPT
WITH ANOTHER MAN

29:38.330 --> 29:41.197
UNTIL I STARTED HAVING
SEX WITH MY HAIRDRESSER.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.519
AND THE FIRST TIME
MY HAIRDRESSER
FRIEND AND I

29:51.530 --> 29:54.522
HAD INTERCOURSE,

29:54.530 --> 29:58.523
HE ASKED ME TO PLEASURE
MYSELF SO HE WOULD KNOW,

29:58.530 --> 30:02.193
YOU KNOW,
HOW I DID THAT.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.760
AN D,

30:04.760 --> 30:07.752
I COULDN'T.

30:07.760 --> 30:12.629
BECAUSE I HAD
NEVER PLEASURED
MYSELF IN MY LIFE.

30:12.630 --> 30:15.599
I WAS 52 YEARS OLD.

30:15.600 --> 30:19.855
AND I HAD TO
LEARN HOW TO...

30:19.860 --> 30:22.624
MASTU RBATE.

30:22.630 --> 30:25.224
FROM
A HAIRDRESSER.

30:25.230 --> 30:27.255
( laughing )
OHH...

30:30.930 --> 30:33.751
OH, MY...

30:33.760 --> 30:36.490
WELL, RUTH,

30:36.500 --> 30:40.254
THANK YOU FOR
SHARING THAT, BUT,

30:40.260 --> 30:42.558
I'M STILL NOT
GONNA TELL YOU

30:42.560 --> 30:44.494
ABOUT COMING OUT
TO MY PARENTS.

30:44.500 --> 30:45.694
WHY NOT ?

30:45.700 --> 30:47.998
BECAUSE I NEVER DID,
CUPCAKE.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.094
MY DADDY WOULD'VE NEVER
SPOKEN ANOTHER WORD TO ME

30:51.100 --> 30:52.852
AND MY MOTHER
WOULD'VE JUST GONE,

30:52.860 --> 30:55.658
INSANE, RIGHT THERE,
ON THE SPOT.

30:55.660 --> 30:57.150
HOW DO YOU KNOW ?

30:57.160 --> 31:00.288
A CHILD KNOWS WHAT HIS
PARENTS NEED HIM TO BE.

31:00.300 --> 31:03.349
MY MOTHER IS
ONE OF THOSE WOMEN

31:03.360 --> 31:06.022
THAT NEVER DID ANYTHING
BUT RAISE CHILDREN.

31:06.030 --> 31:08.191
SO, IF YOU
CAME OUT WRONG,

31:08.200 --> 31:10.896
LIKE THE OPPOSITE
OF WHAT SHE WAS TRYING
TO MAKE YOU INTO,

31:10.900 --> 31:14.154
THEN, YOU KNOW,
HER WHOLE LIFE IS A FAILURE.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.425
I'M NOT LIKE THAT.

31:25.400 --> 31:28.051
( Brenda )
DID HE EVER ACTUALLY
THREATEN YOU ?

31:28.060 --> 31:29.459
UH, TELLING
THE NEW BOYFRIEND

31:29.460 --> 31:30.893
YOU WANTED THE OLD
BOYFRIEND DEAD

31:30.900 --> 31:32.299
WHILE YOU'RE PLAYING
WITH A FUCKING KNIFE,

31:32.300 --> 31:34.427
YEAH, THAT SEEMS LIKE
A THREAT TO ME.

31:43.730 --> 31:45.994
HOW COME YOU NEVER
TOLD ME ABOUT TREVOR ?

31:46.000 --> 31:48.992
IT'S SUCH
ANCIENT HISTORY.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.093
YOU SAID YOU'D NEVER BEEN
SERIOUS ABOUT ANYONE.

31:51.100 --> 31:53.660
I WAS 18.

31:53.660 --> 31:56.424
DID YOU
LOVE HIM ?

31:56.430 --> 31:58.648
YES.

31:58.660 --> 32:01.049
SO, WHAT HAPPENED ?

32:01.060 --> 32:04.029
BILLY GOT SICK.

32:04.030 --> 32:06.828
TREVOR WENT TO
YALE WITHOUT ME.

32:06.830 --> 32:09.253
BILLY GOT RID OF HIM
BECAUSE HE WAS JEALOUS.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.694
EVERYONE WAS
JEALOUS OF TREVOR.

32:11.700 --> 32:13.793
HE WAS
RIDICULOUSLY GIFTED.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.121
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO
EVERYBODY SECRETLY HATES

32:16.130 --> 32:17.995
BECAUSE HE'S GOOD
AT EVERYTHING

32:18.000 --> 32:20.992
AND ALWAYS GETS
WHAT HE WANTS.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.252
HE DIDN'T
GET YOU.

32:23.260 --> 32:25.296
OH, PLEASE,
HE COULD DO BETTER.

32:25.300 --> 32:28.258
HE DID, ACTUALLY.

32:28.260 --> 32:29.625
THE WOMAN HE MARRIED

32:29.630 --> 32:32.019
WON THE NATIONAL
BOOK AWARD LAST YEAR.

32:32.030 --> 32:34.294
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
RIDICULOUSLY GIFTED TOO.

32:34.300 --> 32:38.259
YOU COULD BE ONE OF THOSE
PEOPLE WHO HAS EVERYTHING.

32:49.400 --> 32:50.924
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW, BREN'.

32:50.930 --> 32:52.352
IF YOU DON'T WANNA
DEAL WITH THIS,

32:52.360 --> 32:53.918
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE TO
WAN NA CALL YOUR PARENTS.

32:53.930 --> 32:56.251
WELL, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO
WANNA CALL MY PARENTS, BUT,

32:56.260 --> 32:58.854
UNFORTUNATELY,
THEY HAPPEN TO BE IN
SOUTH AFRICA AT THE MOMENT.

32:58.860 --> 33:01.158
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO IDEA HOW TO CONTACT THEM.

33:01.160 --> 33:03.299
WOULD YOU STOP
FUCKING AROUND ?

33:03.300 --> 33:05.825
I LOVE YOU AND I'M SURE THAT
WHATEVER YOU FEEL ABOUT ME,

33:05.830 --> 33:07.923
YOU DON'T WANNA
SEE ME DEAD.

33:15.730 --> 33:17.197
ARE YOU OKAY ?

33:19.200 --> 33:21.498
NO.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.456
DO YOU WANT ME TO
TAKE YOU TO A DOCTOR ?

33:26.760 --> 33:28.990
WHAT, NOW YOU THINK
I'M CRAZY, TOO ?

33:30.430 --> 33:32.227
NO, NO.

33:33.760 --> 33:36.228
GODAMMIT, WHY ARE YOU
SHUTTING ME OUT ?

33:38.660 --> 33:41.458
I JUST WANNA
BE ALONE, OKAY ?

33:41.460 --> 33:44.725
I JUST WANNA
GO TO SLEEP.

33:49.960 --> 33:52.053
WELL, GOODNIGHT.

34:39.860 --> 34:41.293
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME

34:41.300 --> 34:43.325
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH GABRIEL DIMAS ?

34:43.330 --> 34:46.322
I GUESS I JUST
WASN'T IN THE MOOD

34:46.330 --> 34:48.890
FOR A LECTURE ON
INAPPROPRIATE FRIENDS.

34:48.900 --> 34:50.856
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I WOULD DO THAT ?

34:50.860 --> 34:52.691
WELL, SOME PEOPLE
DON'T THINK

34:52.700 --> 34:54.588
HE'S THE GREATEST
INFLUENCE.

34:54.600 --> 34:56.591
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

34:56.600 --> 35:00.388
I THINK THAT I'M AS MUCH
OF AN INFLUENCE ON HIM

35:00.400 --> 35:02.595
AS HE IS ON ME, SO,

35:02.600 --> 35:04.693
IT'S NOT LIKE IT
ONLY GOES ONE WAY.

35:04.700 --> 35:06.918
RIGHT.

35:06.930 --> 35:09.023
RELATING TO ANOTHER
PERSON IS A WAY

35:09.030 --> 35:10.657
WE RELATE TO A PART
OF OURSELVES.

35:15.260 --> 35:18.798
HE'S LIKE AN EXTREME
VERSION OF ME, YOU KNOW ?

35:18.800 --> 35:20.119
I CAN SEE THAT.

35:21.830 --> 35:24.526
BUT, WHAT HE'S
GOING THROUGH,

35:24.530 --> 35:26.851
IT'S SO MUCH MORE.

35:26.860 --> 35:29.693
BUT I UNDERSTAND,
YOU KNOW ?

35:29.700 --> 35:33.352
FEELING LIKE YOU'VE
GOT THIS SHADOW OVER YOU

35:33.360 --> 35:35.396
ALL THE TIME.

35:37.660 --> 35:39.696
WHAT'S YOUR
SHADOW ?

35:39.700 --> 35:42.157
UMM...

35:44.560 --> 35:46.596
DEATH, I GUESS.

35:48.130 --> 35:50.621
DEATH AND SILENCE.

35:53.830 --> 35:55.821
IS THAT CRAZY ?

35:55.830 --> 35:57.354
WHAT'S THE SILENCE ?

36:00.530 --> 36:04.318
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S LIKE SADNESS, OR...

36:07.360 --> 36:08.793
FEAR, MAYBE.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.755
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY'S SO SCARED

36:12.760 --> 36:15.092
THAT THEY'RE GONNA
SAY THE WRONG THING.

36:15.100 --> 36:18.729
'CAUSE, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU BURY SOMEONE,

36:18.730 --> 36:21.722
IT'S THE MOST SENSITIVE
TIME IN A PERSON'S LIFE.

36:21.730 --> 36:24.893
SO, IT'S LIKE MY FAMILY,
THEY'RE JUST SO CAREFUL.

36:24.900 --> 36:28.028
IT'S LIKE THEY ALMOST
BECOME INVISIBLE.

36:32.560 --> 36:33.993
THAT WAS HEAW.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.956
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

36:45.960 --> 36:48.520
NOTHING, I'M JUST
BEING A FREAK.

36:51.900 --> 36:53.356
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE AFRAID

36:53.360 --> 36:55.123
THAT YOU'LL SAY
THE WRONG THING.

36:55.130 --> 36:56.825
THAT'S JUST IT,
I'M NOT.

36:58.830 --> 37:01.822
I MEAN, I DO SAY
THE WRONG THING.

37:01.830 --> 37:05.197
BUT, IT'S LIKE, THIS
IS GONNA SOUND STUPID,

37:05.200 --> 37:08.897
BUT LIKE I TALK SO MUCH
SHIT ALL THE TIME, YOU KNOW,

37:08.900 --> 37:14.156
AND THAT'S JUST ANOTHER
WAY TO NOT SAY...

37:14.160 --> 37:16.856
WHATEVER.

37:16.860 --> 37:19.249
TO NOT SAY WHAT ?

37:27.960 --> 37:29.689
I'M NOT HERE
FOR THE SCHOOL,

37:29.700 --> 37:31.725
OR FOR YOUR MOM,

37:31.730 --> 37:33.618
I'M JUST HERE
FOR YOU.

37:36.800 --> 37:39.098
THIS IS CONFIDENTIAL, RIGHT ?

37:49.000 --> 37:52.254
GABE DIDN'T
O.D. BY ACCIDENT.

37:52.260 --> 37:56.697
HE DID IT ON PURPOSE
I THINK.

37:56.700 --> 38:00.454
WELL, MOST O.D.'s AREN'T
REALLY JUST ACCIDENTS.

38:00.460 --> 38:02.690
RIGHT, SO, WHAT CAN I DO
AS THE FRIEND OF A PERSON

38:02.700 --> 38:04.656
WHO WOULD DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?

38:04.660 --> 38:08.221
LIKE, I KNOW ALL THE,
"I CAN'T SAVE HIM" STUFF,

38:08.230 --> 38:10.027
AND, I WENT
TO THE WEBSITES,

38:10.030 --> 38:12.419
AND IT'S ALL LIKE
"WHAT YOU CAN'T DO".

38:12.430 --> 38:14.557
SO, WHAT CAN DO I ?

38:16.660 --> 38:19.356
TRY NOT TO MAKE
YOURSELF INVISIBLE.

38:19.360 --> 38:21.624
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

38:21.630 --> 38:23.951
THAT'S NOT A VERY
GOOD START, IS IT ?

38:34.100 --> 38:36.898
AT LEAST MY TIE CAN
BE STRAIGHT, RIGHT ?

38:36.900 --> 38:39.789
YOU SHOULD HAVE
LEFT ME THE WAY I WAS,

38:39.800 --> 38:44.089
LET THE WORLD SEE ME
FOR WHO I WAS REALLY AM.

38:44.100 --> 38:46.955
AN ABOMINATION
OF NATURE.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.359
SHUT UP.

38:48.360 --> 38:51.852
WHO YOU ARE IS NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

38:51.860 --> 38:53.350
THAT'S A LITTLE
HARD TO BUY,

38:53.360 --> 38:54.497
COMING FROM SOMEBODY

38:54.500 --> 38:56.252
WHO CRUISES FOR DICK
ON THE INTERNET

38:56.260 --> 38:58.728
AND HAS UNSAFE SEX
WITH PROSTITUTES.

38:58.730 --> 39:00.527
YOU KNOW,
THEY MADE A SHRINE

39:00.530 --> 39:02.054
AT THE PLACE
WHERE YOU DIED,

39:02.060 --> 39:05.598
WITH PICTURES
OF YOU AND FLOWERS.

39:05.600 --> 39:08.455
PEOPLE GO THERE AND
HOLD CANDLES IN YOUR HONOR.

39:08.460 --> 39:10.098
WHAT PEOPLE ?

39:10.100 --> 39:11.749
YOUR FRIENDS,
YOUR COMMUNITY.

39:11.760 --> 39:14.149
BLEEDING HEART FAGGOTS
WITH NOTHING BETTER TO DO.

39:14.160 --> 39:16.424
GUYS WHO FUCKED ME
WHEN THEY WERE DRUNK

39:16.430 --> 39:18.398
AND THEN NEVER
CALLED ME BACK.

39:18.400 --> 39:20.152
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO LOVE YOU.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.697
BUT NOT AS MANY
AS HATE ME.

39:22.700 --> 39:24.395
AND YOU.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.822
( clapping )

39:32.800 --> 39:35.394
NICE JOB.

39:35.400 --> 39:39.621
MAN, THAT IS THE BEST WORK
YOU'VE EVER DONE, DAVID.

39:39.630 --> 39:41.325
THAN KS.

39:41.330 --> 39:44.128
NICE, VERY NICE.

39:49.360 --> 39:52.488
HEY, THERE'S LIKE
200 HOMOS OUTSIDE.

39:52.500 --> 39:54.991
ALREADY ?

39:55.000 --> 39:56.797
IT'S ONLY
QUARTER OF.

39:56.800 --> 39:59.257
YOU'D THINK THE FAMILY
WOULDN'T WANT ALL OF THAT

39:59.260 --> 40:00.921
COMING IN HERE,
YOU KNOW ?

40:00.930 --> 40:03.251
ALL OF WHAT ?

40:03.260 --> 40:04.955
THERE'S THIS ONE GUY,

40:04.960 --> 40:06.996
HE'S DRESSED
LIKE JACKIE KENNEDY.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.754
YOU THINK THIS GUY'S MOTHER
REALLY NEEDS TO SEE THAT TODAY ?

40:13.100 --> 40:14.897
HOW'D YOU GET THOSE
ABRASIONS ON HIS CHEEK

40:14.900 --> 40:16.549
SO SMOOTH LOOKING ?

40:16.560 --> 40:18.994
I USED DIAPER RASH CREAM,
YOU LEFT SOME.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.149
WOW.

40:23.460 --> 40:25.257
YOU KNOW, RICO,
I'M A HOMO.

40:29.230 --> 40:31.425
I MAY NOT DRESS
LIKE JACKIE KENNEDY

40:31.430 --> 40:33.159
BUT I HAVE
SEX WITH MEN.

40:41.630 --> 40:44.599
DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT THAT,

40:44.600 --> 40:46.898
ALRIGHT ?

40:46.900 --> 40:49.619
WHY SHOULD I HAVE
TO HIDE IT FROM YOU ?

40:49.630 --> 40:51.291
YOU CHANGE YOUR BABY'S
DIAPER IN MY HOUSE,

40:51.300 --> 40:54.519
YOU SHOW ME A VIDEOTAPE
OF YOUR WIFE GIVING BIRTH.

40:54.530 --> 40:56.452
WHERE I COME FROM,

40:56.460 --> 40:59.429
IF MEN NEED TO
DO THAT SOMETIMES,

40:59.430 --> 41:02.194
THEY DON'T
TALK ABOUT IT.

41:04.130 --> 41:05.859
THEY DON'T LEAVE
THEIR WIFE AND KIDS,

41:05.860 --> 41:06.827
THEY'RE STILL MEN.

41:06.830 --> 41:08.821
IAMAMAN!

41:15.430 --> 41:16.988
SO I TOOK
THE HEIGHT
OF TREE "A"

41:17.000 --> 41:19.525
AND DIVIDED IT BY
THE LENGTH OF SHADOW "B".

41:19.530 --> 41:22.829
SO, DO YOU SEE HOW
I GOT TO TANGENT "C" ?

41:28.660 --> 41:29.922
DON'T GET ME WRONG,

41:29.930 --> 41:32.091
I KNOW IT'S
TOTALLY POINTLESS.

41:32.100 --> 41:34.295
JUST SOMEHOW,
TEACHING YOU

41:34.300 --> 41:36.427
MAKES IT SEEM
MORE INTERESTING.

41:36.430 --> 41:37.749
IT MUST BE
THE POWER.

41:40.930 --> 41:43.751
WELL, YOU,

41:43.760 --> 41:46.422
ARE A VERY

41:46.430 --> 41:48.751
STIMULATING TEACHER.

41:48.760 --> 41:51.126
I LOVE YOUR,

41:51.130 --> 41:54.156
GRASP OF
THE MATERIAL.

41:56.330 --> 41:59.299
UMM, MAYBE WE SHOULD
GRASP THE NEXT ONE.

41:59.300 --> 42:01.621
WHICH ONE ?

42:01.630 --> 42:03.757
NUMBER FIVE.

42:06.360 --> 42:08.248
COME HERE.

42:19.560 --> 42:20.959
WHAT IS IT ?

42:20.960 --> 42:22.757
NOTHING.

42:24.819 --> 42:24.830
i’ézfni—ETE—(‘é—gég
:f34,-E"Kt—; J; 23‘392
55:: fLT/s x L‘: X‘i:

42:24.830 --> 42:27.048
HEY, COME ON.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.024
I'M SCARED.

42:39.460 --> 42:41.519
IT'S OKAY.

42:41.530 --> 42:43.919
I'M SCARED, TOO.

42:46.230 --> 42:48.255
I'M SCARED YOU'RE
GONNA DISAPPEAR.

42:52.060 --> 42:53.925
I'M NOT
GONNA DISAPPEAR.

42:59.300 --> 43:01.393
WHAT ARE YOU
SCARED OF ?

43:06.660 --> 43:10.596
I'M SCARED I'M NOT GONNA
FINISH MY MATH HOMEWORK.

43:10.600 --> 43:12.488
HEY, I TOLD YOU.

43:17.630 --> 43:20.724
I'M SCARED
THAT YOU

43:20.730 --> 43:24.655
ARE TOO GOOD FOR ME.

43:24.660 --> 43:26.651
OH, YOU'RE CRAZY.

43:35.560 --> 43:37.289
I FINALLY FIND A WOMAN
I WANNA COMMIT TO,

43:37.300 --> 43:39.325
AND SHE MAKES IT
TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

43:39.330 --> 43:41.321
YOU THINK THAT'S
A COINCIDENCE ?

43:41.330 --> 43:43.958
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN ?

43:43.960 --> 43:46.451
MAYBE IF SHE
MADE IT EASIER

43:46.460 --> 43:48.257
YOU WOULDN'T
BE SO EAGER.

43:50.630 --> 43:53.155
I NEED MORE GARLIC.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.960
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN BORED
WITH THE GIRLS YOU COULD HAVE,

43:57.960 --> 44:00.121
AND FASCINATED WITH
THE ONES YOU COULDN'T.

44:02.630 --> 44:04.894
YEAH, WELL, WHOSE
FAULT IS THAT ?

44:15.330 --> 44:17.491
YOUR BROTHER'S GAY,
ISN'T HE ?

44:20.800 --> 44:23.098
I THINK THAT'S
A QUESTION FOR HIM.

44:23.100 --> 44:25.398
HAS HE TOLD YOU ?

44:27.400 --> 44:29.391
NO, HE HAS
NOT TOLD ME.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.960
BUT, IT'S OBVIOUS,
EVERYONE KNOWS.

44:31.960 --> 44:33.552
AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY
SOMETHING TO HIM ?

44:33.560 --> 44:34.993
I TRIED, I TRIED
TO DISCUSS IT,

44:35.000 --> 44:36.149
HE WOULDN'T LET ME.

44:36.160 --> 44:37.798
I GUESS HE DOESN'T
WAN NA TALK ABOUT IT, MOM.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.051
BUT IT'S NOT GOOD
FOR A PERSON

44:39.060 --> 44:40.391
TO SKULK AROUND
LIKE THAT.

44:40.400 --> 44:42.459
HE'S VERY TENSE,
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR HIM.

44:42.460 --> 44:43.597
BREATHE, MOM.

44:43.600 --> 44:45.192
I KNOW HOW
TO BREATHE !

44:45.200 --> 44:46.497
AND I DON'T APPRECIATE
YOU BLAMING ME

44:46.500 --> 44:48.821
FOR ALL YOUR PROBLEMS,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

44:48.830 --> 44:52.254
YOUR CARROTS
ARE BURNING.

44:55.760 --> 44:58.228
Haven't you seen a little
girl called Bunny ?

44:58.230 --> 45:00.494
About your age ?

45:00.500 --> 45:02.593
A new girl.

45:02.600 --> 45:06.092
With a dress,
just like yours...

45:06.100 --> 45:08.898
( glass breaking )

45:09.830 --> 45:11.752
( door opening )

45:23.860 --> 45:25.828
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

45:25.830 --> 45:28.856
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

45:31.030 --> 45:32.793
I KNOW HOW TO FIX IT.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.756
YEAH ?
FIX WHAT ?

45:34.760 --> 45:38.196
OH, IT WAS
A BIG MISTAKE.

45:38.200 --> 45:40.259
BUT I'M GONNA
FIX IT, OKAY ?

45:42.100 --> 45:44.694
OH, MY GOD, BILLY,
WHAT HAVE YOU...

45:44.700 --> 45:47.055
DID YOU HURT HIM ?

45:47.060 --> 45:48.789
NO, NO, NO,
I FIXED IT.

45:49.660 --> 45:51.298
OH, GOD.

45:51.300 --> 45:53.029
SEE, I CAN'T BE
HIM ANYMORE.

45:53.030 --> 45:54.622
HE'S SOMEBODY
ELSE NOW.

45:54.630 --> 45:55.722
I DID IT FOR YOU.

45:55.730 --> 45:57.357
AND NOW WE CAN BURY HIM,
AND THE BEST PART IS

45:57.360 --> 45:59.328
NOW THE NURSE WON'T
EVER BE ABLE TO FIND HIM.

45:59.330 --> 46:01.457
YOU'VE LOST
A LOT OF BLOOD.

46:01.460 --> 46:03.690
LET ME GET A TOWEL.

46:03.700 --> 46:05.395
WE JUST HAVE TO
GET YOURS NOW.

46:08.460 --> 46:10.496
THIS WAY, YOU'LL BE
SAFE FROM HER, TOO,

46:10.500 --> 46:11.728
FOR LIKE
THE FIRST TIME EVER

46:11.730 --> 46:13.095
AND THEN WE
CAN BURY THEM,

46:13.100 --> 46:14.522
AND THEN YOU AND I
CAN BE NEW PEOPLE.

46:14.530 --> 46:16.020
AND WE CAN FORGET
ABOUT EVERYTHING

46:16.030 --> 46:17.998
BAD THAT THEY WROTE.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.456
I DON'T WANT US
TO BE NEW PEOPLE,

46:19.460 --> 46:22.725
I LIKE US
THE WAY WE ARE.

46:22.730 --> 46:24.652
WELL, I ALREADY
DID IT, BRENDA,

46:24.660 --> 46:26.150
SO, YOU HAVE
TO DO IT, TOO.

46:28.160 --> 46:29.696
OKAY.

46:31.730 --> 46:34.119
GIVE ME
THE KNIFE.

46:34.130 --> 46:36.189
I WANNA DO IT.

46:36.200 --> 46:37.792
NO, YOU DID YOURS,
I SHOULD DO MINE.

46:37.800 --> 46:39.222
NATHANIEL
SAVED ISABEL ONCE,

46:39.230 --> 46:40.652
THEY WERE
ON THE SAILBOAT...

46:40.660 --> 46:41.991
IT'S A BOOK,
IT'S FICTION.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.456
AND HE GAVE HER
MOUTH TO MOUTH

46:43.460 --> 46:44.825
AND SAVED HER FOR
THE FIRST TIME...

46:44.830 --> 46:46.718
NATHANIEL AND ISABEL
ARE NOT REAL.

46:56.160 --> 46:58.025
I NEED TO DO IT.

47:03.330 --> 47:05.651
BILLY, GET OFF ME !

47:08.100 --> 47:10.295
BILLY,
GET OFF ME !

47:11.630 --> 47:13.757
I'M WARNING YOU,
THIS IS GONNA HURT.

47:21.930 --> 47:24.398
YES, HELLO,
I NEED AN AMBULANCE.

48:17.730 --> 48:20.198
( male )
YOUR SON'S BURNING IN HELL !

48:20.200 --> 48:22.020
GOD HATES FAGS !

48:22.030 --> 48:23.588
GOD HATES MORONS !

48:23.600 --> 48:25.227
THE WAGES OF SIN
IS DEATH !

48:25.230 --> 48:26.822
AND AIDS !

48:26.830 --> 48:29.298
YOU LEAVE THESE PEOPLE
ALONE OR SO HELP ME...

48:29.300 --> 48:30.392
IT'S MY RIGHT
TO BE HERE.

48:30.400 --> 48:31.526
YEAH, THIS
IS AMERICA.

48:31.530 --> 48:32.929
IT'S MY RIGHT
TO TELL THE TRUTH.

48:32.930 --> 48:35.228
GOD KILLED MARC FOSTER
AND I'M HERE TO CELEBRATE.

48:35.230 --> 48:37.994
GOD JUST SHOVED YOUR
STOMACH INTO YOUR LUNGS

48:38.000 --> 48:39.353
AND I'M HERE
TO CELEBRATE !

48:40.800 --> 48:43.598
LOOK, GOD JUST GOT
YOU IN THE FACE !

48:43.600 --> 48:45.192
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU ?

48:45.200 --> 48:46.497
HE STARTED IT.

48:46.500 --> 48:47.819
YOU ALRIGHT, SIR ?

48:47.830 --> 48:49.127
THAT MAN OUGHTA
BE ARRESTED.

48:49.130 --> 48:50.597
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT,
YOU JUST WATCH YOURSELF.

48:50.600 --> 48:52.329
I DEMAND THAT THAT
MAN BE ARRESTED !

48:52.330 --> 48:54.753
THIS IS A FUNERAL,
SHOW SOME RESPECT.

48:57.560 --> 48:58.959
WHAT HAPPENED ?
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN ?

48:58.960 --> 49:00.825
NO, NOTHING HAPPENED.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.627
I'M SORRY.

49:15.630 --> 49:17.359
DON'T APOLOGIZE TO ME.

49:17.360 --> 49:19.055
DAMN...

49:19.060 --> 49:20.550
YOU MESSED
THAT GUY UP.

49:22.400 --> 49:25.699
NO, I'M SORRY
FOR HOW I'VE BEEN.

49:25.700 --> 49:27.691
I'M JUST,

49:27.700 --> 49:30.055
I'M SORRY.

49:31.830 --> 49:34.924
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO WORK
NOT TO BE WORRYING

49:34.930 --> 49:36.921
ABOUT YOU
ALL THE TIME.

49:36.930 --> 49:38.727
YOU COULD GET
YOURSELF KILLED IF--

49:38.730 --> 49:40.948
IF WHAT ?

49:40.960 --> 49:43.520
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT.

49:43.530 --> 49:46.556
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WANT.

49:46.560 --> 49:48.118
ARE YOU SURE ?

49:48.130 --> 49:49.449
YES.

49:51.900 --> 49:55.529
I'M SORRY FOR
HOW I WAS, WITH YOU,

49:55.530 --> 49:57.725
WHEN WE WERE
TOGETHER.

49:57.730 --> 50:00.426
I DON'T KNOW WHY
IT'S SO HARD FOR ME.

50:00.430 --> 50:02.523
IT'S HARD
FOR ALL OF US.

50:05.560 --> 50:07.221
BUT, YOU KNOW
THAT YOU'RE RIGHT,

50:07.230 --> 50:08.424
THAT YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.

50:08.430 --> 50:11.399
FOR ME IT'S LIKE I AGREE
WITH THEM, YOU KNOW ?

50:11.400 --> 50:13.755
LIKE IT IS MY FAULT,
AND I SHOULD BE ABLE

50:13.760 --> 50:14.897
TO FIX IT.

50:14.900 --> 50:16.356
THERE'S NOTHING
TO FIX.

50:16.360 --> 50:18.419
BUT IT'S NOT
WHO I WANNA BE.

50:18.430 --> 50:20.523
I WANNA BE LIKE
THE GUY AT MY CHURCH

50:20.530 --> 50:22.225
WITH THE KID
ON HIS KNEE.

50:22.230 --> 50:24.289
YOU CAN HAVE A KID
ON YOUR KNEE, DAVID.

50:24.300 --> 50:26.188
THAT GUY PROBABLY HASN'T
SLEPT WITH HIS WIFE

50:26.200 --> 50:27.258
IN FIVE YEARS.

50:32.330 --> 50:35.254
I FEEL LIKE MY FATHER
WOULD HATE ME IF HE KNEW.

50:35.260 --> 50:38.525
YOU TOLD ME
HE DID KNOW.

50:38.530 --> 50:40.748
AND HE NEVER
SAID ANYTHING.

50:40.760 --> 50:42.250
DID YOU ?

50:50.730 --> 50:53.893
MY GIRL'S NAMED CLAIRE,
SHE LIKES IT CLEAN,

50:53.900 --> 50:56.994
SHE'S GOT ORANGE HAIR,
SMELLS LIKE TANGERINES,

50:57.000 --> 50:59.924
SHE'S GOT ORANGE HAIR,
SMELLS LIKE BENZEDRINE !

50:59.930 --> 51:01.454
WOULD YOU SHUT UP ?

51:01.460 --> 51:03.223
MY MOTHER'S GONNA FRY
YOUR BALLS FOR BREAKFAST

51:03.230 --> 51:05.050
IF SHE CATCHES
YOU IN HERE.

51:05.060 --> 51:06.550
NICE.

51:06.560 --> 51:09.688
SO, IS THAT PRETTY MUCH
WHAT YOU EAT
IN A FUNERAL HOME ?

51:09.700 --> 51:11.292
YEAH, WHY ?

51:31.230 --> 51:34.597
( music playing )

52:25.630 --> 52:27.427
YOU OKAY ?

52:30.400 --> 52:32.527
I HAD BILLY
COMMITTED.

52:57.860 --> 52:59.350
MOM ?

53:01.500 --> 53:03.752
ARE YOU OKAY ?

53:03.760 --> 53:06.422
I HAVE A TERRIBLE
HEADACHE.

53:06.430 --> 53:08.898
WELL, MAYBE
WE CAN TALK LATER.

53:08.900 --> 53:11.789
WHAT, WHAT ?

53:13.760 --> 53:15.819
I'M GAY.

53:15.830 --> 53:18.799
WHY DIDN'T YOU
EVER TELL ME ?

53:18.800 --> 53:21.018
I AM TELLING YOU.

53:21.030 --> 53:23.590
BEFORE, BEFORE.
DON'T YOU TRUST ME ?

53:23.600 --> 53:26.091
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
I'M TELLING YOU.

53:26.100 --> 53:28.694
BUT I'VE TRIED TO DISCUSS IT
WITH YOU SEVERAL TIMES.

53:28.700 --> 53:31.123
LOOK, I JUST WASN'T
COMFORTABLE, OKAY ?

53:31.130 --> 53:32.427
WHAT DOES
IT MATTER NOW ?

53:32.430 --> 53:34.057
WHY NOT ?

53:34.060 --> 53:36.119
WHEN I WAS CLEARLY
TRYING TO BE OPEN.

53:36.130 --> 53:37.552
YOU KNOW, MOM.

53:37.560 --> 53:40.825
YOU MAY BE TRYING
TO BE OPEN NOW,

53:40.830 --> 53:44.152
AND THAT'S GREAT,

53:44.160 --> 53:49.052
BUT, THAT'S NOT HOW
YOU'VE BEEN FOR ALL MY LIFE.

53:49.060 --> 53:50.925
YOU AND DAD,

53:50.930 --> 53:52.329
NO ONE TALKED
ABOUT ANYTHING,

53:52.330 --> 53:53.797
NONE OF US
ARE LIKE THAT.

53:53.800 --> 53:55.290
EXCEPT NATE,
AND THAT'S JUST BECAUSE

53:55.300 --> 53:57.723
HE HAS NO OTHER WAY
TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF.

53:57.730 --> 54:00.494
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU.

54:00.500 --> 54:04.197
I KNOW YOU LOVE THE PART
OF ME THAT'S YOUR SON.

54:04.200 --> 54:07.397
WHAT PART OF YOU
ISN'T MY SON ?

54:07.400 --> 54:09.197
YOU'RE ALL MY SON.

54:09.200 --> 54:11.555
I DON'T THINK
YOU KNOW ME VERY WELL.

54:11.560 --> 54:13.221
WELL, WHOSE
FAULT IS THAT ?

54:15.160 --> 54:17.048
I'M SORRY.

54:25.660 --> 54:27.628
AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'VE
TRIED TO BRING IT UP BEFORE,

54:27.630 --> 54:29.450
OR NOW, EVEN,

54:29.460 --> 54:32.554
IT'S LIKE YOU'VE DECIDED
YOU SHOULD KNOW WHO I AM.

54:32.560 --> 54:34.096
LIKE YOU'RE WILLING
TO SEE ME THE WAY

54:34.100 --> 54:36.056
YOU'D MAKE YOURSELF LOOK
AT SOMETHING HORRIBLE.

54:36.060 --> 54:39.120
LIKE A CORPSE, BECAUSE
IT'S YOUR JOB, YOUR DUTY.

54:39.130 --> 54:41.690
IT REVOLTS YOU, BUT
YOU MAKE YOURSELF BEAR IT.

54:41.700 --> 54:43.952
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG,
YOU DON'T REVOLT ME !

54:43.960 --> 54:47.020
I DON'T CHOOSE WHICH
PART OF YOU I LOVE,

54:47.030 --> 54:48.998
LIKE SOME
KIND OF CHICKEN !

54:53.430 --> 54:56.695
IT WAS JUST
SO MUCH EASIER

54:56.700 --> 54:58.258
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE

54:58.260 --> 55:00.820
AND YOU WOULD
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

55:00.830 --> 55:05.449
AND WHEN YOU WERE UPSET,
I COULD ALWAYS FIX IT.

55:05.460 --> 55:10.227
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
TAKE CARE OF YOU ANYMORE.

55:10.230 --> 55:15.623
JUST LET ME
TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

55:15.630 --> 55:17.723
BUT DO YOU ?

55:17.730 --> 55:19.618
I'M AFRAID
THAT YOU DON'T.

55:19.630 --> 55:22.724
I DO, I WILL.

55:29.500 --> 55:31.821
WELL,

55:31.830 --> 55:36.995
THAT'S ALL
THAT I WANTED TO SAY.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.092
ALRIGHT.

55:40.160 --> 55:42.196
WE'RE HAVING VEAL.

55:54.060 --> 55:57.427
WELL, MOMMY
STILL LOVES YOU.

55:57.430 --> 56:00.149
DOES THAT MAKE
EVERYTHING BETTER ?

56:02.100 --> 56:04.989
YEAH, I DIDN'T
THINK IT WOULD.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.524
WHAT ARE YOU STILL
DOING HERE ?

56:06.530 --> 56:08.589
I COULD'VE COME OUT TO
EVERY MOTHER IN THE WORLD,

56:08.600 --> 56:10.295
AND I'D STILL
BE DEAD.

56:21.800 --> 56:24.428
OH, WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA
INTERRUPT HIM

56:24.430 --> 56:26.728
AND HIS MATCHING
LOVE STUD ?

56:26.730 --> 56:28.891
BOTH OF THEM WILL BE
IN HELL WITH US,
BY THE WAY.

56:28.900 --> 56:30.595
BUT SOMETHING
TELLS ME

56:30.600 --> 56:32.397
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE
A LOT MORE FUN.

56:32.400 --> 56:34.994
STOP, STOP.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.524
MAKE ME.

56:43.460 --> 56:46.520
PLEASE, GOD, HELP ME,
TAKE THIS PAIN AWAY.

56:46.530 --> 56:50.591
PLEASE FILL
THIS LONELINESS
WITH YOUR LOVE.

56:50.600 --> 56:53.854
HELP ME, GOD,
PLEASE HELP ME.
