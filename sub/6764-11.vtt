01:35.929 --> 01:37.226
Hey, don't touch that dial.

01:37.397 --> 01:40.195
It's time to stop the violence towards
women and Take Back the Night.

01:40.366 --> 01:42.459
This is KXCU,
and we'll be here with you

01:42.635 --> 01:45.866
for the lectures, the workshops
and the rallies all week long.

01:46.039 --> 01:49.202
<i>Every animal species
has its own set of dating rules.</i>

01:49.375 --> 01:52.105
<i>But if you break the rules,
you better watch out.</i>

01:52.278 --> 01:53.973
<i>Even if you are king of the jungle.</i>

01:59.285 --> 02:02.186
<i>For the giraffe,
a nuzzle is a sure sign of affection.</i>

02:04.090 --> 02:07.856
<i>What's this? The koala has its own
unique way of saying, "I love you. "</i>

02:08.026 --> 02:11.019
I really hope that David
is paying attention to this.

02:11.197 --> 02:13.665
Why? You see this
and you think of David?

02:13.833 --> 02:15.926
You have to admit,
there's a certain resemblance.

02:17.770 --> 02:19.635
<i>The dance
of the diamondback rattler.</i>

02:19.806 --> 02:22.036
Isn't that? Why, yes, it is.
It's John Sears.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.369
You know, I would recognize
those shifty moves anywhere.

02:24.844 --> 02:27.438
Believe it or not,
he's actually been very sweet.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.775
Almost old-fashioned.

02:29.949 --> 02:31.644
<i>Man has evolved mating rituals</i>

02:31.818 --> 02:34.719
<i>as mysterious as any
in the animal kingdom.</i>

02:34.888 --> 02:38.722
<i>It's our own way of saying yes or no.</i>

02:45.865 --> 02:46.957
Welcome, all of you.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.233
And thanks for being part
of Take Back the Night Week.

02:50.403 --> 02:53.099
Well, we've just seen that birds do it.

02:53.740 --> 02:57.198
And bees do it.
And believe me, Charlie Chaplin did it.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.574
But let's go back
and ask ourselves why they do it.

03:01.748 --> 03:03.909
We'll start to look at differences
between men and women

03:04.083 --> 03:07.314
that I think are at the heart of the war
between the sexes we're all fighting.

03:07.487 --> 03:10.388
Doesn't the husband of the lecturer
rate a better seat than this?

03:10.557 --> 03:11.819
I didn't wanna make her nervous,

03:11.991 --> 03:14.152
and apparently, my wife really knows
how to play a room.

03:14.327 --> 03:15.988
Yeah, Lucinda's a player all right.

03:16.162 --> 03:19.154
So are you coming over to our place
for supper around 8?

03:19.332 --> 03:20.731
That's tonight?

03:20.900 --> 03:23.494
Hey, come on, your favorite
basketball star's gonna be there.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.468
Shouldn't D'Shawn really be cramming
for his midterms about now?

03:26.639 --> 03:28.402
All right, look,
I'll give D'Shawn a pep talk.

03:28.575 --> 03:31.635
I'm afraid it's gonna take more than
a pep talk, Corey. We are way behind.

03:31.811 --> 03:34.211
We'll double-team him.
Whatever it takes to keep him eligible.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.211
The thought of another
losing basketball season

03:36.382 --> 03:38.179
is just too much to bear.

03:41.988 --> 03:44.081
You know what I've got here?

03:44.257 --> 03:46.919
- A royal flush?
- Five of a kind.

03:47.093 --> 03:50.756
Five phone messages for you,
all from a certain Laura Kingman.

03:50.930 --> 03:53.228
All in the last 24 hours.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.993
Yeah, well, I don't wanna talk to her.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.761
If you wanna keep
the good times rolling,

03:57.937 --> 03:58.995
throw the girl a bone.

03:59.172 --> 04:01.640
Dude, I don't wanna
keep the ball rolling, okay?

04:01.808 --> 04:03.571
I went out with her once
and it was a mistake.

04:03.743 --> 04:06.541
Then blow her off so we don't get
stuck being your answering machine.

04:06.713 --> 04:09.978
- Or pass her on to someone else.
- Yes, experience the gift of giving.

04:10.149 --> 04:12.014
You guys are bent.

04:12.452 --> 04:14.010
Hello?

04:15.188 --> 04:17.247
I'll see if he's in.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.825
Sanders, are you in?

04:21.494 --> 04:24.019
It's Laura.

04:29.569 --> 04:31.594
Why did I take poetry? I am doomed.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.740
Come on, Bren, the exam's only, what,
half your grade? Don't worry about it.

04:34.907 --> 04:37.569
Dr. Pettey could have been speaking
Martian just now for all I know.

04:37.744 --> 04:40.838
<i>Like Biographia Literaria.
What is that?</i>

04:41.014 --> 04:43.983
It is a condition which develops
when you spend the entire semester

04:44.150 --> 04:46.209
running around with Stuart Carson.

04:46.386 --> 04:49.184
Dylan, I just never connected
with this romantic poetry stuff.

04:49.355 --> 04:50.481
Bren, obviously you do.

04:50.657 --> 04:53.285
You ran off to elope with some guy
you'd known for five minutes.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.017
- It was five weeks.
- Whatever.

04:55.194 --> 04:57.560
And I'm telling you,
it's all just words to me.

04:57.730 --> 05:00.699
What are you saying? You want me
to help you study for this exam?

05:00.867 --> 05:04.598
- Is that your way of offering to?
- I asked you first.

05:04.771 --> 05:06.432
Yes.

05:19.852 --> 05:22.753
- Speak of the devil.
- About time you showed up.

05:22.922 --> 05:25.220
I was telling your friend Laura
how you once worked here

05:25.391 --> 05:28.155
for three days on a bet with Brandon.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.228
I don't remember it being that funny.

05:30.396 --> 05:31.420
It was.

05:31.597 --> 05:33.394
- Come on, let's get a booth.
- Sure.

05:33.566 --> 05:36.501
- It was nice to meet you.
- Pleasure was mine, sweetheart.

05:36.936 --> 05:38.961
I'm gonna kill you later.

05:44.510 --> 05:48.844
I'm sorry about all the phone calls,
but I just kept thinking about you.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.309
It's no big deal, really.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.453
Didn't you think about me
a little bit too?

05:55.321 --> 05:58.984
Yeah. And, Laura,
I have something I need to tell you.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.794
Something good I hope.

06:03.930 --> 06:08.060
Laura, I have a girlfriend.
Her name is Celeste,

06:08.234 --> 06:11.169
and I know I should have told you this
before we went out...

06:12.438 --> 06:15.236
Hey, come on, come on,
try not to take it so hard.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.137
What do you expect?

06:18.511 --> 06:20.274
You pressured me
into sleeping with you,

06:20.446 --> 06:21.674
and now you're dumping me.

06:21.848 --> 06:23.839
Look, I know this won't come out
the way I mean it,

06:24.016 --> 06:25.779
but couldn't we just be friends?

06:25.952 --> 06:27.977
The other night
you didn't wanna just be friends.

06:28.154 --> 06:29.587
There are other guys
at the KEG House

06:29.756 --> 06:31.781
I could introduce you to.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.585
I don't want other guys.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.022
Look, I'm sorry.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.628
I wish there was something
I could say, something I could do.

06:37.797 --> 06:39.731
You can go to hell.

06:49.776 --> 06:52.711
Well, I have to say,
this feels like old times.

06:52.879 --> 06:55.473
Yeah, only it used to be Brenda
helping me with my homework

06:55.648 --> 06:56.740
and not vice versa.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.850
Oh, so that means you owe me.

07:02.388 --> 07:05.084
- Honey, you look very nice.
- Thank you, Mom.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.317
You know, everyone else
is going crazy over midterms

07:07.493 --> 07:10.519
and Brandon is going
to his professor's for dinner.

07:10.696 --> 07:12.288
Does he know something
that we don't?

07:12.465 --> 07:14.023
I'd rather be studying, believe me.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.667
Jeez, back in our time,

07:15.835 --> 07:18.429
dinner with a professor
was a major perk.

07:18.871 --> 07:21.271
- Meant you had arrived.
- Still does.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.602
If any of you would like to arrive
in my place, please.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.074
Oh, I would love to
if I could meet your professor's wife.

07:26.245 --> 07:28.213
Donna said
she gave the most amazing talk

07:28.381 --> 07:29.939
to kick off
Take Back the Night Week.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.176
It was on the courtship rituals.
Kind of a hobby of hers.

07:33.352 --> 07:35.343
Are you two going
to the date-rape seminar tomorrow?

07:35.521 --> 07:37.148
Yeah, and have some woman
in a crew cut

07:37.323 --> 07:40.656
label me a potential rapist?
I don't think so.

07:41.093 --> 07:43.288
- A little male backlash?
- What are you talking about?

07:43.463 --> 07:46.762
I mean, they did not even allow men
to take part in this thing until last year.

07:46.933 --> 07:49.731
Bro, you should really consider going.
There are a lot of babes there.

07:49.902 --> 07:51.699
- Brandon.
- Brandon.

07:52.772 --> 07:55.707
Sorry. Good night.

08:00.613 --> 08:02.774
Wow, what a nice surprise.

08:03.516 --> 08:06.576
Isn't it great? It just came in today.

08:07.253 --> 08:10.484
- Hey, what is this made out of?
- It's cloth, Sanders.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.853
It's cashmere, and it's 40 percent off
with my employee discount.

08:14.026 --> 08:15.926
It's beautiful.

08:16.562 --> 08:19.292
Oh, look, how cute. They can't
keep their hands off each other.

08:19.465 --> 08:21.933
You should take a lesson from her.

08:22.301 --> 08:24.701
Hey, what do you guys think, huh?

08:25.538 --> 08:28.530
Well, I think that Celeste
has very good taste.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.868
- You need me.
- I never said I didn't.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.477
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Wait for me.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.413
Hurry back.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.346
I'd give anything to be a fly on the wall
of that bathroom.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.389
Well, that's quite an ambition.

08:46.559 --> 08:48.891
I'll tell you what you'd hear.

08:49.061 --> 08:51.689
Kelly would be saying
how tonight she closes the deal.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.355
She was giving me the vibe
all through dinner.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.025
Man, why don't you cut her a break?
Is that all you think about?

08:58.638 --> 09:00.538
I know you used to have
a thing for her, Sanders,

09:00.706 --> 09:01.934
but come on, she's into me now.

09:02.108 --> 09:03.234
Oh, of course.

09:03.409 --> 09:06.105
But does she know about that
bunch of girls you have on the side?

09:06.279 --> 09:09.112
Oh, like you told Celeste
about what's-her-name?

09:09.282 --> 09:11.944
- Love bunny?
- No, I didn't.

09:12.118 --> 09:14.143
But I did tell Laura about Celeste,
and believe me,

09:14.320 --> 09:17.346
it would've been an education for
both of you to see how hurt she was.

09:17.523 --> 09:20.117
Oh, I get it. You hurt Laura,
so I shouldn't sleep with Kelly.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.555
Well, that makes a lot of sense.

09:22.228 --> 09:25.197
Sears, this is not a game.
People do get bruised, you know.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.733
Thank you for sharing, Mr. Sensitive.

09:31.804 --> 09:35.137
- Shall we?
- Okay.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.510
Malone can take Barkley any day.

09:41.681 --> 09:42.705
That's crazy talk.

09:42.882 --> 09:44.645
Nobody can guard Barkley
one-on-one that long.

09:44.817 --> 09:47.115
- I'm not talking about...
- Oh, please, no more basketball.

09:47.286 --> 09:49.447
I have done
my requisite job time this week.

09:49.622 --> 09:51.817
We went to the Clipper game
last night.

09:51.991 --> 09:53.959
You know, I'd think,
as an anthropologist,

09:54.126 --> 09:57.095
you'd find the ritual of basketball
a fascinating one.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.958
Well, as an anthropologist,

09:59.131 --> 10:01.190
I do find guys
running around in gym shorts

10:01.367 --> 10:03.460
an interesting public display.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.939
You should study the game, Lucinda,
you'd enjoy it more.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.372
Stop the presses.
You're telling somebody to study?

10:11.544 --> 10:14.308
Well, that must be your influence.
How is he?

10:14.814 --> 10:15.838
As a teacher?

10:16.515 --> 10:19.348
Difficult, man. Brandon is hard.

10:21.153 --> 10:22.484
Yeah, so I've noticed.

10:26.025 --> 10:29.722
- I think I'll clear the table now.
- I'll give you a hand.

10:31.063 --> 10:33.998
I believe you two
have some business to discuss.

10:34.166 --> 10:38.102
- D'Shawn.
- Here it is. Sociology.

10:39.538 --> 10:41.529
You were flirting with me
in front of your husband.

10:41.707 --> 10:43.140
- Was I?
- Weren't you?

10:43.309 --> 10:47.370
Good God, Brandon, grow up.
It was only flirting, it's meaningless.

10:48.247 --> 10:50.772
And stop whispering.

10:52.084 --> 10:56.316
- Am I acting like a hick here?
- Yes, and it's boring.

10:59.792 --> 11:04.024
But you wanna know
how you can make it up to me?

11:04.897 --> 11:06.455
I can't wait to hear.

11:10.369 --> 11:12.098
Have you ever done it
on a kitchen table?

11:18.944 --> 11:20.912
You're dangerous.

11:31.557 --> 11:34.321
Don't you think it's time
we moved on to the main event?

11:35.928 --> 11:38.488
I thought you said
you'd wait 50 years for me.

11:38.664 --> 11:41.098
It feels like
it's already been that long.

11:45.504 --> 11:49.304
John, I don't wanna do this, okay?

11:50.376 --> 11:52.367
What, have you been talking
to Sanders or something?

11:52.545 --> 11:55.343
No, it's not a conspiracy
that I don't wanna to sleep with you.

11:55.514 --> 11:56.913
Well, something's going on.

11:57.083 --> 12:00.018
I'm a senior, I'm in KEG House,
I've got girls lined up taking numbers

12:00.186 --> 12:01.710
and you make me feel
like I've got the plague.

12:01.887 --> 12:04.151
What do you want me to do?

12:04.423 --> 12:05.913
It just doesn't feel right, okay?

12:06.092 --> 12:07.992
Feel right?

12:08.227 --> 12:10.161
Jeez,
what's with the Snow White act?

12:10.596 --> 12:12.996
Come on, I was there,
I know what you're really about.

12:13.165 --> 12:16.066
Do you think I'm hanging around
for your brilliant freshman repartee?

12:17.136 --> 12:19.263
- You haven't changed a bit, have you?
- Kelly...

12:19.438 --> 12:22.464
You do not know the first thing about
what it's like to care for somebody.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.734
I can't believe
I was actually falling for you.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.242
If this is how you fall for someone,
you got a lot to learn.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.382
Why don't you find somebody else
to teach it to?

12:33.119 --> 12:34.416
Dylan, I did not tell you this

12:34.587 --> 12:36.350
so you would run over there
and punch him out.

12:36.522 --> 12:40.618
- Come on, Kelly, somebody's got to.
- But not by you, okay?

12:41.527 --> 12:44.257
Whatever. As long as you're okay.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.455
You are okay?

12:46.999 --> 12:49.229
Yes, I'm okay.

12:49.635 --> 12:51.626
I'm better than okay.

12:51.804 --> 12:53.999
That's what I came here to tell you.

12:54.173 --> 12:56.835
You know, if this had happened
three years ago,

12:57.009 --> 13:00.137
I probably would have stayed with him
even after what he said.

13:00.646 --> 13:03.308
Well, I'm glad
it's not three years ago.

13:03.482 --> 13:05.450
You're getting it together.

13:06.218 --> 13:07.981
I hope so.

13:08.621 --> 13:13.456
And if I am starting to get
more inner strength or whatever,

13:13.626 --> 13:16.561
I think maybe it's because
you're the first guy

13:16.729 --> 13:17.991
who ever took me seriously.

13:19.498 --> 13:22.990
- Kel.
- No, you were.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.933
I just can't believe
I got so caught up with him.

13:32.411 --> 13:33.639
What happened to us, Dylan?

13:36.682 --> 13:38.274
I don't know.

13:42.021 --> 13:44.421
Must have got lost somewhere.

13:47.026 --> 13:49.460
You sure you don't want me
to whack him? Because I will.

13:51.363 --> 13:52.830
No.

13:53.432 --> 13:56.492
I think that, for Sears,
having a girl tell him to get lost

13:56.669 --> 13:59.399
is cruel and unusual punishment
enough.

13:59.572 --> 14:02.268
- Yeah.
- No macho guy stuff, okay?

14:02.441 --> 14:05.342
Okay, no guy stuff.

14:06.045 --> 14:09.811
I will walk you to your car.
That's guy stuff.

14:26.966 --> 14:31.903
Has he gotten to the point
where he'll wait 50 years yet?

14:32.071 --> 14:34.039
That's the good stuff.

14:34.473 --> 14:35.997
Give me a sec.
I'll be right back, okay?

14:36.175 --> 14:37.301
What's your problem, McKay?

14:37.476 --> 14:39.842
No problem. Just my way of saying
enough's enough.

14:40.012 --> 14:42.310
Yeah, well, maybe I haven't decided
when enough is enough.

14:42.481 --> 14:44.574
And Kelly can make
her own decisions, don't you think?

14:44.750 --> 14:46.615
Yeah. She decided
you make her sick.

14:46.785 --> 14:49.345
Well, she'll change her mind.
They always do.

14:49.521 --> 14:50.613
Not this time.

14:50.789 --> 14:53.656
Well, then you don't have anything
to worry about, do you, partner?

14:53.826 --> 14:56.795
Leave her alone. I mean it.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.900
Kelly.

15:05.437 --> 15:07.735
Well, well, well,
what an enlightened time we live in.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.841
A KEG man going to a seminar
on date rape.

15:10.009 --> 15:12.204
Yeah, right.
No, I just came here to find you.

15:12.378 --> 15:13.902
Well, here I am. What's up?

15:14.079 --> 15:16.639
Kelly, I know you're sleeping
with John Sears, and I...

15:17.316 --> 15:19.807
I am not.
And I'm not going to, either.

15:19.985 --> 15:21.213
Not after last night.

15:21.387 --> 15:22.945
You know he's like the state reptile?

15:23.122 --> 15:25.090
Yes, and it should be stamped
on his forehead.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.154
Did you come here
to warn me about him?

15:29.528 --> 15:32.190
Yeah. I should have told you sooner,
I'm sorry.

15:32.665 --> 15:36.658
Well, it looks like I'm not the only one
getting their act together.

15:36.835 --> 15:38.063
Thank you.

15:56.388 --> 15:57.912
Donna.

15:58.357 --> 16:00.450
This is Laura Kingman.
We're in Organic Chem together.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.322
Hi. Oh, another genius, huh?

16:03.495 --> 16:04.985
There's Kelly.

16:05.164 --> 16:06.563
Hey, guys.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.960
- Hey, I'm Kelly.
- Hi. Laura.

16:10.102 --> 16:11.364
Hello, everyone.

16:11.870 --> 16:15.738
I am Leslie Sumner from Alpha House
and the Pan-Hellenic council.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.500
We'll be splitting up
into smaller groups

16:17.676 --> 16:19.200
a little later on on the lawn,

16:19.378 --> 16:21.846
but first I would like to introduce
Angela Rhodes

16:22.014 --> 16:24.983
from the student senate,
just so we're all in sync.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.811
Angela?

16:28.821 --> 16:30.345
Thank you.

16:30.556 --> 16:32.251
Let me ask you a few questions.

16:32.424 --> 16:34.949
How many of you
have ever been burglarized?

16:35.127 --> 16:38.119
Raise your hands.
In a dorm room or your home.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.098
Does having your purse stolen
count?

16:41.266 --> 16:43.063
Sure. Welcome to the club.

16:43.235 --> 16:45.669
And take a look, you're not alone.

16:45.838 --> 16:50.832
Okay. How many of you
have ever been held up at gunpoint?

16:51.443 --> 16:54.071
If only Dylan were here to see this.

16:55.481 --> 16:58.507
Okay,
I know this is a sensitive question,

16:58.684 --> 17:01.346
but how many of you
have ever been a victim of date rape?

17:04.089 --> 17:06.648
High school,
it was practically a weekend ritual.

17:07.559 --> 17:10.118
If you look at the hands
going up and down,

17:10.295 --> 17:13.162
you realize that date rape
is a little different.

17:14.967 --> 17:18.528
See, if someone
holds a gun to your head, you know it.

17:18.971 --> 17:22.771
But if you're date raped,
maybe you're not sure.

17:22.941 --> 17:24.875
So let's talk about that today.

17:30.249 --> 17:32.979
Hundred and twenty pounds.
That's more than I weigh.

17:33.652 --> 17:36.951
Just think,
you could grab me in your hands,

17:37.122 --> 17:39.113
right here and here.

17:40.526 --> 17:44.360
Press me up, and press me up.

17:45.030 --> 17:46.327
It would be fun.

17:46.498 --> 17:48.898
Don't you have a Take Back the Night
workshop to go to?

17:49.068 --> 17:54.267
I already did my bit for humanity.
Today, I am a free woman.

17:54.773 --> 17:56.070
If you're just gonna stand there,

17:56.241 --> 17:58.368
the least you could do
is spot my weight for me, huh?

18:01.814 --> 18:03.509
Hey, don't you push down on that.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.747
See how much easier life is
when you work as a team?

18:11.390 --> 18:12.857
You just don't give up, do you?

18:13.525 --> 18:16.858
It's a cliché, I know.
Younger man, bolder woman.

18:17.029 --> 18:18.621
Now it's gonna be a lot more
than a cliché

18:18.797 --> 18:21.163
if your husband finds out
what's going on.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.463
Nothing is going on,
or we'd both be sweating.

18:26.538 --> 18:27.903
Don't look at me that way.

18:29.775 --> 18:33.575
Admit it, you love the attention.

18:40.319 --> 18:43.152
My boyfriend wants to have sex
and I don't,

18:43.322 --> 18:46.814
but I know that if he begged
and pleaded and pushed,

18:46.992 --> 18:49.586
that I would probably
eventually give in.

18:49.761 --> 18:53.492
And I know that's not rape,
but it's not with my consent either.

18:53.665 --> 18:55.132
Does that make any sense?

18:55.300 --> 18:56.597
Yeah.

18:56.768 --> 18:59.931
It was on Halloween
a couple of years ago.

19:00.339 --> 19:02.102
At first I felt responsible

19:02.274 --> 19:06.506
because I was looking
to meet someone

19:06.678 --> 19:10.409
in a costume
that was four sizes too small.

19:10.916 --> 19:16.252
But he threw me down on a bed,
and I was yelling no.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.882
If it hadn't been for my friends
bursting in, then...

19:20.792 --> 19:23.352
Well, I guess I know
what would have happened.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.767
I don't want anybody
to take this the wrong way,

19:29.935 --> 19:31.994
but I'm worried
that we're assigning women

19:32.171 --> 19:36.631
a very outdated,
very passive role here.

19:36.808 --> 19:40.005
Well, it doesn't take a genius
to figure out that men rape women,

19:40.179 --> 19:42.044
not the other way around.

19:42.447 --> 19:44.711
I know that, but you know what,

19:44.883 --> 19:47.147
it's like, if I get drunk
and I run somebody over,

19:47.319 --> 19:48.581
that's my fault.

19:48.754 --> 19:51.018
But if I get drunk and I decide
to have sex with some guy

19:51.190 --> 19:54.523
and wish later I hadn't,
we're saying that it's his fault.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.991
Really, Andrea,
men do get women drunk.

19:57.162 --> 19:58.390
Excuse me, Phil Donahue,

19:58.564 --> 20:02.364
but women can decide
what they will and will not drink.

20:03.635 --> 20:06.536
For a guy who claims to be a feminist,
you put me in my place, didn't you?

20:06.705 --> 20:08.297
I was arguing
the feminist point of view.

20:08.473 --> 20:10.134
I was arguing
the feminist point of view.

20:10.309 --> 20:12.072
You were trying
to make me look stupid.

20:12.244 --> 20:15.111
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'll never contradict you again.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.243
I gotta go study.

20:20.686 --> 20:23.246
When did you figure out
the guy was a rapist?

20:23.422 --> 20:24.446
Not soon enough.

20:24.623 --> 20:27.217
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have gone upstairs with him.

20:27.392 --> 20:30.327
Right, you wouldn't have.

20:32.764 --> 20:36.200
You know, Laura, sometimes
it helps to talk to somebody.

20:36.368 --> 20:39.269
I mean, I know most people
aren't as lucky as I was.

20:39.438 --> 20:43.966
Oh, no. I'm okay. Really.

20:44.142 --> 20:46.736
And you're probably swamped, so...

20:46.912 --> 20:48.209
No, I'm not.

20:50.382 --> 20:52.247
Do you wanna go somewhere
and talk?

20:55.887 --> 20:57.320
Okay.

20:58.156 --> 21:06.393
<i>Had we but world enough and time
This coyness, lady, were no crime</i>

21:06.898 --> 21:09.833
Well, a miracle of paradox.

21:10.002 --> 21:13.267
Obviously a meditation on desire.

21:13.438 --> 21:16.134
- Yeah, his desire.
- Miss Walsh.

21:16.708 --> 21:19.040
Are you finally joining us
after half a semester?

21:19.978 --> 21:22.572
Well, I read it last night,
and it's pretty one-sided.

21:22.748 --> 21:26.878
I mean, she keeps on saying no,
and he won't take no for an answer.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.618
It's like date rape.

21:30.255 --> 21:31.950
That's ridiculous, come on.

21:32.424 --> 21:35.416
Well, class, she says it's date rape,
he says it's not.

21:35.594 --> 21:37.994
It's not even close. I mean, it's not...

21:38.163 --> 21:40.222
The girl in the poem.
I mean, she obviously knows

21:40.399 --> 21:43.095
how difficult it is to open your heart
to another human being.

21:43.268 --> 21:44.496
That's why she's skittish.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.832
How do you know
that one day your girlfriend

21:47.005 --> 21:48.529
is not gonna tell you
that she loves you

21:48.707 --> 21:50.607
and then you turn around
and she's running around

21:50.776 --> 21:52.243
with some geek
from the KEG House?

21:52.978 --> 21:56.209
I think you might be reading too much
into the text, Mr. McKay.

22:00.886 --> 22:03.821
He made me have sex with him.

22:04.523 --> 22:07.651
And all I can think about
is what I should have done differently.

22:07.826 --> 22:10.989
It's not your fault. It really isn't.

22:12.130 --> 22:13.688
I hate him so much now.

22:14.433 --> 22:15.627
So it's somebody you know?

22:18.337 --> 22:21.033
You know, Laura, it is a crime.
You can tell the police.

22:21.907 --> 22:25.399
It happened more than a week ago,
and I didn't go to a doctor.

22:25.577 --> 22:29.013
- Nobody would believe me.
- Well, I believe you.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.648
And I will stand by you.

22:30.816 --> 22:33.580
- You will?
- Yes.

22:33.752 --> 22:35.219
And if you can't go to the police,

22:35.387 --> 22:38.083
then maybe you can stand up at
the Take Back the Night rally tomorrow

22:38.256 --> 22:40.781
and tell every girl on this campus
exactly who to watch out for.

22:41.793 --> 22:45.354
- No, I don't think I could do that.
- Yes, you can.

22:45.530 --> 22:48.363
Come on, there are some people
I want you to talk to.

22:57.075 --> 23:00.704
So when you get right down to it,
classical sociological theory

23:00.879 --> 23:04.747
is basically ways of stating
and restating the obvious.

23:04.916 --> 23:07.282
It's not that obvious, Walsh.

23:07.452 --> 23:09.852
D'Shawn, don't do it, man,
or I'm out of here.

23:11.923 --> 23:14.016
<i>DJ, looking to get the ball inside.</i>

23:14.192 --> 23:16.183
See you later, man.
I got better things to do.

23:16.361 --> 23:18.090
Don't I know it.

23:18.463 --> 23:21.864
I saw you two at the gym today.
Aching to get busy.

23:27.839 --> 23:29.397
What are you talking about?

23:29.574 --> 23:31.337
You and Lucinda.

23:31.510 --> 23:33.410
I saw her moving on you
at dinner last night too.

23:35.814 --> 23:38.282
- I don't know what you think you saw.
- Oh, man.

23:38.450 --> 23:41.783
That look in her eye said you two
are doing the sweet thing.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.913
I'll have to ask the professor
if he saw it too.

23:47.459 --> 23:48.517
No, just kidding.

23:48.693 --> 23:51.184
D'Shawn, you'd better start spending
a little more time studying

23:51.363 --> 23:54.332
and a lot less time fantasizing
if you're gonna pass this test.

23:54.499 --> 23:56.899
That's okay. We both know
you're gonna pass it for me.

23:57.669 --> 23:58.966
You're dreaming.

23:59.337 --> 24:03.137
Well, in my dream,
you give me a big fat B.

24:03.975 --> 24:06.944
- You said you were kidding, right?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

24:13.218 --> 24:17.086
- How are you doing?
- Better, thanks.

24:17.255 --> 24:20.019
Are you sure
you don't wanna tell us his name?

24:20.192 --> 24:22.626
Laura, I guarantee
you'll feel a whole lot better.

24:23.562 --> 24:26.963
I do wanna tell you. It's just...

24:30.735 --> 24:32.100
He's from KEG House.

24:32.871 --> 24:34.702
That's where it happened.

24:36.575 --> 24:38.907
He poured some vodka
or something.

24:39.077 --> 24:41.705
It was the last thing that I wanted.

24:41.880 --> 24:45.577
Anyway, we were making out,
which was nice.

24:45.750 --> 24:48.310
I mean, because I really like this guy.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.581
Before, I mean, I liked him before.

24:52.424 --> 24:56.417
Somehow my dress got unbuttoned.

24:56.595 --> 25:01.555
<i>And before I knew it, he had
pulled my dress down completely,</i>

25:01.733 --> 25:04.930
<i>and he pushed me
back onto the bed.</i>

25:05.103 --> 25:07.731
<i>I tried to get him to stop,
but he wouldn't.</i>

25:07.906 --> 25:12.707
<i>And I tried to push him off,
but he was too heavy.</i>

25:13.578 --> 25:16.138
<i>I begged him to stop.</i>

25:16.314 --> 25:17.906
Finally, I just said,

25:18.083 --> 25:22.144
"If you're gonna do this,
please at least use a condom. "

25:24.623 --> 25:28.753
- Is that date rape?
- That's exactly what it is.

25:28.927 --> 25:31.487
But don't be afraid to call it that.

25:33.198 --> 25:36.361
Look, Laura,
if this guy is from KEG House,

25:36.535 --> 25:38.799
then we all know other people
that he can hurt.

25:38.970 --> 25:41.666
Yeah, you know, guys like that,
they don't do this just once.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.501
It's a pattern.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.608
I just need more time.

25:48.780 --> 25:53.774
Look, we have some time
before the rally.

25:54.252 --> 25:56.413
I'm sure you'd be ready
to say his name by then.

25:58.189 --> 25:59.451
Okay?

26:05.530 --> 26:09.830
Leslie's right, you know.
He's just gonna do this again.

26:10.001 --> 26:11.696
Maybe he won't.

26:11.870 --> 26:14.600
If it's who I think it is,
you can count on it.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.567
Look, you don't have to
protect him anymore.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.369
I know it was John Sears.

26:20.312 --> 26:21.904
I don't even know John.

26:23.815 --> 26:26.750
It was this guy,
his name is Steve Sanders.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.681
Steve?

26:29.688 --> 26:32.623
Wait, this has gotta be a mistake.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.552
You heard them. It was rape.

26:35.727 --> 26:37.854
No, but I know him,
and he's not like that.

26:38.029 --> 26:40.156
He did everything
exactly like I said he did.

26:40.865 --> 26:41.923
Laura, I am begging you.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.762
You cannot go to that march and
tell everybody that Steve raped you.

26:44.936 --> 26:46.028
I can't believe you.

26:46.204 --> 26:48.604
You promised that you would
stick by me through thick and thin

26:48.773 --> 26:51.537
and now you're trying to tell me
that it didn't even happen?

26:51.710 --> 26:54.178
Look, at least let me talk to him first.

26:54.346 --> 26:55.973
You're doing what men
have always done

26:56.147 --> 26:58.240
when a woman finds the strength
to come forward.

26:58.416 --> 27:00.577
You're as bad as he is.

27:09.828 --> 27:12.126
How could you do that to Laura?

27:12.864 --> 27:16.425
All right, it was sleazy, and I'm sorry,
but people get dumped all the time.

27:16.601 --> 27:18.762
No, I mean, how could you rape her?

27:19.437 --> 27:20.961
Rape?

27:21.373 --> 27:23.500
- Did you say rape?
- She says rape.

27:23.675 --> 27:24.937
She's out of her mind.

27:25.110 --> 27:27.806
She's not saying that you held a gun
to her head or anything.

27:27.979 --> 27:30.470
She's saying that you pushed
and pushed until she had no choice.

27:30.949 --> 27:31.973
She's crazy.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.619
She's saying that you plied her
with drinks.

27:34.786 --> 27:36.048
I didn't ply her with anything.

27:36.221 --> 27:38.052
Wait a second,
how do you even know about this?

27:38.590 --> 27:40.854
- Laura told me.
- And you believe her?

27:41.026 --> 27:42.459
Not like this girl could lie, Kelly?

27:42.627 --> 27:45.494
Or maybe she forgot to tell you
about her major party personality.

27:45.897 --> 27:49.025
Man, everything out of her mouth
was a come on.

27:49.200 --> 27:53.933
<i>She wore this sexed-up lingerie,
it was hot.</i>

27:55.073 --> 27:59.407
<i>We got close,
we danced over to the bed.</i>

27:59.811 --> 28:01.073
<i>You know how it works.</i>

28:01.246 --> 28:04.306
<i>But the insane thing is, I didn't even
think we were gonna go all the way</i>

28:04.482 --> 28:06.313
<i>until she pulls a condom
out of her own purse.</i>

28:06.484 --> 28:09.510
<i>What is that? She was into it.</i>

28:09.688 --> 28:12.316
Believe me, she was into it.

28:12.624 --> 28:14.319
Has she been telling this crap
to everybody?

28:14.492 --> 28:17.120
She's been vague.

28:17.862 --> 28:20.456
But, Steve, she's gonna
name you publicly at the rally.

28:20.632 --> 28:22.964
At the rally? She can't do that.

28:23.134 --> 28:27.002
She can do that, and she's going to.
And people are going to believe her.

28:28.273 --> 28:29.297
Do you believe me, Kelly?

28:32.811 --> 28:36.110
- Yes, I do. But...
- I'm dead.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.710
You're probably gonna
get kicked out of your fraternity.

28:39.884 --> 28:42.819
- And the university.
- I mean Celeste.

28:44.322 --> 28:45.482
I'm gonna lose Celeste.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.492
You really outdid yourself this time.

28:52.363 --> 28:54.797
Howard, it's not like I ask
for that many favors.

28:54.966 --> 28:55.990
I'm sure Donna can handle

28:56.167 --> 28:58.158
the Take Back the Night broadcast
by herself.

28:58.336 --> 29:00.065
- Right?
- Yeah, I guess.

29:00.238 --> 29:01.262
If I have to.

29:01.439 --> 29:03.771
Did you hear that? She's thrilled.

29:06.444 --> 29:07.468
Great, he put me on hold.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.504
How come
you don't wanna cover the rally?

29:09.681 --> 29:11.945
Because all I've been hearing all week
is how men

29:12.117 --> 29:14.881
are just slobbering sex fiends,
and I'm tired of it.

29:15.053 --> 29:18.045
Look, David, I know some of the girls
may not have that much objectivity,

29:18.223 --> 29:19.656
but what they talk about is real.

29:19.824 --> 29:22.622
Yeah, it's real. Remember that woman
who talked to us about having AIDS

29:22.794 --> 29:25.024
in high school?
She's dead now. That's real.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.422
I have a father
who keeps ruining his life and mine

29:28.600 --> 29:30.465
because he can't keep his pants on,
that's real.

29:30.635 --> 29:31.795
David.

29:31.970 --> 29:35.337
I just don't need any more reminders
of how horrible things are.

29:36.641 --> 29:38.302
I haven't even told you
the worst part yet.

29:39.577 --> 29:40.976
What?

29:41.246 --> 29:42.804
My girlfriend won't sleep with me.

29:44.449 --> 29:47.247
- Brutal.
- Yeah.

29:50.855 --> 29:52.345
Laura.

29:53.591 --> 29:54.785
Hey, I didn't do anything.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.950
You're just lucky
I'm not pressing criminal charges.

29:57.128 --> 29:59.460
You can't press criminal charges,
because there was no rape.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.861
It was sex, that's all it was.
Listen to me.

30:02.033 --> 30:04.399
What are you gonna do, throw me
down? You wanna beat me up?

30:04.569 --> 30:06.662
You're handing me to a lynch mob
because you got dumped?

30:06.838 --> 30:09.170
Lynch mob?
What do you think it was like with you?

30:09.340 --> 30:10.398
Oh, was it so horrible?

30:10.575 --> 30:14.568
Is that why you agreed to meet me
at the Peach Pit, Laura? Laura!

30:15.313 --> 30:17.076
God.

30:19.851 --> 30:22.012
Hey, any last tips
before the midterm?

30:22.187 --> 30:24.712
You seem to have your own ideas.

30:24.889 --> 30:26.322
Well, you were right
about that poem.

30:27.792 --> 30:29.885
It's called romantic poetry
for a reason.

30:30.061 --> 30:32.996
Well, I don't know, Bren.
Maybe it's all a bad joke, you know?

30:33.164 --> 30:35.223
Like Kelly and John Sears.
That's a bad joke.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.958
Kelly said she called it quits.

30:37.135 --> 30:39.194
Well, I don't think he'll give up
that easy.

30:40.138 --> 30:42.197
Well, I don't believe
that I'm about to encourage you

30:42.373 --> 30:47.436
to give Kelly a second chance,
but if that's what you want...

30:47.779 --> 30:49.974
Dylan, don't let stupid stuff
stand in your way.

30:50.148 --> 30:51.240
Stupid stuff?

30:51.416 --> 30:54.010
Like maybe he apologizes,
she goes out with him again?

30:54.185 --> 30:55.447
I think that'd be pretty stupid.

30:55.620 --> 30:58.180
Hey, like you said,
that's the risk we take.

30:58.823 --> 31:01.656
I don't know.
I don't know if it's worth it.

31:02.660 --> 31:06.255
Dylan, maybe it's different,

31:06.531 --> 31:09.193
but even after you went off
with Kelly,

31:09.467 --> 31:11.059
I would have taken you back
in a second.

31:11.603 --> 31:13.696
No questions asked.

31:16.307 --> 31:19.538
You know,
I bet Kelly will be at the rally tonight.

31:20.578 --> 31:24.309
Well, it looks like you two
have come to some agreement.

31:25.116 --> 31:27.880
So, what do you think
the poem is about?

31:29.487 --> 31:31.785
I'd say it's personal.

31:32.090 --> 31:33.523
Let's go.

31:39.030 --> 31:41.624
If you need anything else, just...

31:49.240 --> 31:50.332
Well, did you do it?

31:51.276 --> 31:53.107
Of course not.

31:53.945 --> 31:55.640
I just wanted you
to hear it from me first.

31:56.347 --> 31:59.009
I know you wouldn't rape anybody.

32:00.184 --> 32:01.378
But did you sleep with her?

32:04.589 --> 32:09.219
I would like to be able to say no,
because it really didn't matter to me.

32:10.695 --> 32:11.923
But, yes, I did.

32:16.034 --> 32:19.731
What should I expect from some guy
I met on a TV game show?

32:19.904 --> 32:23.032
Hey, come on,
you know how much I care about you.

32:24.442 --> 32:27.934
Even that first night,
you didn't really wanna be with me.

32:28.112 --> 32:31.548
And ever since then, you've
made me feel like I wasn't enough.

32:31.950 --> 32:35.545
Whether it was the way
you talked about Kelly or Jill

32:35.720 --> 32:39.656
or whatever other girl you happened
to be obsessing on at the moment.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.255
I tried to convince myself,

32:42.427 --> 32:45.624
"He's looking at them,
but he really loves me. "

32:45.797 --> 32:47.560
I really do love you.

32:49.167 --> 32:50.600
Not if you slept with somebody else.

32:55.640 --> 32:56.971
Celeste, please don't leave me.

32:58.876 --> 32:59.900
I have to.

33:09.220 --> 33:11.882
Man, I am such an idiot.

33:12.056 --> 33:14.047
Celeste is the first girl
who ever really loves me,

33:14.225 --> 33:16.125
and I go and throw it away.

33:16.294 --> 33:18.194
You stray, you pay, my brother.

33:18.363 --> 33:20.354
But telling her the truth
was the right thing to do.

33:20.531 --> 33:22.931
- I'm not so sure about that.
- It was.

33:23.101 --> 33:24.363
You wanna turn your life around,

33:24.535 --> 33:26.332
you gotta do the right thing,
which you did.

33:27.472 --> 33:29.497
So now what are you gonna do?

33:30.641 --> 33:31.869
Go to the rally, I guess.

33:32.043 --> 33:36.275
- Sounds kind of suicidal.
- I can't hide. I gotta face them.

33:36.781 --> 33:38.749
Then I get to go shop
for a new college.

33:39.484 --> 33:42.317
Well, you're not the only fugitive
around here.

33:42.487 --> 33:44.580
You know how you're in deep
for sleeping with someone?

33:44.756 --> 33:46.451
I'm in deep
for not sleeping with someone.

33:46.624 --> 33:48.888
- What's that mean?
- I'll tell you later.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.721
There's something
I gotta take care of.

33:50.895 --> 33:53.728
Now? No, no, no. You gotta come
to this rally with me, man.

33:53.898 --> 33:57.664
- I need reinforcements for this.
- I'll meet you there, okay?

33:57.835 --> 33:59.666
I gotta do this first.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.712
Hey, coz. What's on your mind?

34:14.886 --> 34:17.514
By the way, Bulls have it locked.

34:19.824 --> 34:22.315
Last time I was in here,
things got a little confusing,

34:22.493 --> 34:24.120
at least for me.

34:24.295 --> 34:26.126
I don't want there
to be any misunderstanding.

34:26.297 --> 34:27.355
Who does?

34:28.399 --> 34:30.264
Straight ahead, then.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.092
I wanna wish you luck
on your midterm.

34:32.270 --> 34:34.101
Straight ahead?

34:36.541 --> 34:37.871
I meant it, Walsh.

34:38.042 --> 34:40.442
You take my test,
or I'll tell Randall you're doing his wife.

34:41.279 --> 34:42.303
There's nothing going on.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.243
Man, I saw what I saw.
Don't insult me.

34:45.116 --> 34:47.641
Okay. Something started.

34:47.819 --> 34:50.549
But when I found out
she was married to Randall, it stopped.

34:50.721 --> 34:54.782
No harm, no foul.
You wanna tell Randall, go ahead.

34:54.958 --> 34:56.516
The worst he can do is flunk me.

34:56.694 --> 34:59.390
You don't understand, man.
I can't do the test.

34:59.797 --> 35:01.788
If you fail,
I'll keep working with you, man.

35:01.966 --> 35:04.594
You might miss a few games,
but you can still pass the semester.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.430
I can't miss games.

35:06.604 --> 35:08.367
Coach said he'll lose me
from the squad.

35:08.539 --> 35:11.736
- You're fooling with my life, man.
- I can't take the test for you.

35:12.877 --> 35:16.369
And even if I could, this academic stuff
isn't gonna go away.

35:16.547 --> 35:19.107
- You gotta deal with it.
- No, you gotta deal with it.

35:20.318 --> 35:21.376
You gotta help me out, man.

35:21.552 --> 35:23.850
What can I do if I can't play ball?
Tell me that, huh?

35:25.356 --> 35:26.721
I'm sorry.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.492
I gotta go.

35:37.668 --> 35:40.364
I'll talk. I'll mess you up.

35:40.538 --> 35:42.335
You're buying yourself
a world of hurt.

35:48.713 --> 35:52.376
<i>No more silence, no more lies.
We will not be victimized.</i>

35:52.550 --> 35:56.850
<i>No more silence, no more lies.
We will not be victimized.</i>

35:57.021 --> 36:00.787
<i>No more silence, no more lies.
We will not be victimized.</i>

36:26.684 --> 36:29.482
Wow, this is really quite a spectacle.

36:29.654 --> 36:33.181
I hate to admit it,
but I'm honestly moved.

36:33.357 --> 36:34.824
Well, then there's hope yet.

36:34.992 --> 36:38.826
<i>Reunite. Take back the night.</i>

36:38.996 --> 36:43.160
Well, the silence
has certainly been broken, huh?

36:43.334 --> 36:44.665
Yeah!

36:48.206 --> 36:51.835
Everybody welcome.
At last the night belongs to us.

36:52.009 --> 36:53.738
Yeah!

36:55.313 --> 36:59.306
And the truly amazing thing
is that all over the country,

36:59.483 --> 37:02.850
rallies like this are saying
that women have lived in fear too long,

37:03.020 --> 37:05.989
and we will not
stand for it anymore, okay?

37:10.361 --> 37:11.589
I'm really glad you came.

37:11.762 --> 37:15.630
Well, you know,
push comes to shove, I love a parade.

37:18.836 --> 37:22.772
Yeah, and so do John Sears
and his clones.

37:24.709 --> 37:26.233
I still wanna deck that guy.

37:26.844 --> 37:30.041
Well, by the time the rally finishes,
you might have to wait in line.

37:30.214 --> 37:33.240
- Four women have had an experience
that equals the legal definition

37:33.417 --> 37:36.011
- of rape or attempted rape.
- Andrea.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.121
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

37:38.289 --> 37:40.189
- It's all right.
- No, no, it's not.

37:40.358 --> 37:44.727
- I was talking to hear myself talk.
- Well, teachers do that sometimes.

37:45.463 --> 37:46.953
So will you forgive me?

37:50.468 --> 37:51.662
Who could say no to that?

37:53.170 --> 37:56.435
We're also victims as individuals.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.199
So let's incite each other tonight.

37:58.376 --> 37:59.400
- Do you see Kelly?
- No.

37:59.577 --> 38:01.977
But she must be
around here somewhere.

38:02.146 --> 38:04.671
Kind of thought she'd stand by me.

38:05.149 --> 38:07.709
- Guess I can't blame her.
- Look.

38:07.885 --> 38:10.911
One courageous act
to stop the violence.

38:11.088 --> 38:13.556
One courageous act
to take back the night

38:13.724 --> 38:15.715
that has become our enemy.

38:18.496 --> 38:21.727
Violence against women kills love.

38:21.899 --> 38:25.926
And violence is inevitable
when you treat people like things.

38:26.837 --> 38:29.465
Okay, it's time to speak out.

38:29.640 --> 38:33.406
And we have a young woman here
who would like to do just that.

38:33.577 --> 38:35.807
Let's give her a hand.

38:51.629 --> 38:55.360
I know that date rape is real
because it happened to me.

38:55.533 --> 38:59.993
A couple of years ago,
a guy I had just met tried to rape me.

39:00.538 --> 39:04.998
And whatever I was wearing,
or whatever he thought that implied,

39:05.176 --> 39:06.438
it was not my fault.

39:07.078 --> 39:09.069
Oh, my God,
Kelly's siding with Laura.

39:09.246 --> 39:13.478
But there have been other times when
I've ended up in someone else's bed,

39:13.651 --> 39:18.486
and even though I regretted it,
it was my responsibility.

39:18.656 --> 39:21.386
I didn't say yes,
but I didn't say no either.

39:25.763 --> 39:28.596
And blaming someone else
doesn't make it their fault.

39:30.768 --> 39:34.499
Anyway, I don't even know the name
of the guy who tried to attack me,

39:34.672 --> 39:37.800
but I do know the name of the guy
who saved me that night.

39:38.409 --> 39:40.502
And he's here tonight.

39:40.978 --> 39:42.309
His name is Steve Sanders.

39:54.091 --> 39:56.150
Maybe if there were more
people out there like Steve,

39:56.327 --> 39:59.660
we wouldn't have to hold a rally
to be able to go outside at night.

40:04.702 --> 40:06.226
Thank you.

40:07.037 --> 40:09.801
Now, I believe
we have another speaker.

40:10.975 --> 40:12.374
Is she here?

40:15.246 --> 40:16.679
Laura.

40:20.518 --> 40:22.042
Thank you.

40:22.219 --> 40:24.016
- Thank Kelly.
- Wait.

40:26.190 --> 40:27.487
I really am sorry.

40:28.859 --> 40:32.386
I knew I wasn't gonna be there for you
the day after.

40:33.130 --> 40:36.588
And I knew you wanted more
than a one-night stand.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.628
Yeah, well, the funny thing is,

40:41.806 --> 40:45.401
I thought my life would be so much
better if I had a guy at KEG House.

40:47.044 --> 40:49.069
Well, you'll have a friend there
if you want one.

40:51.582 --> 40:53.447
Laura,
you could have buried me tonight.

40:54.919 --> 40:57.444
Yeah, well, I didn't have a choice.

40:58.956 --> 41:01.424
I didn't say yes.

41:02.493 --> 41:04.586
But I never said no.

41:16.574 --> 41:18.565
So you've caused a lot of commotion
on campus.

41:18.742 --> 41:21.973
What do you think about the turnout
here? I mean, this is incredible.

41:28.085 --> 41:30.986
- So, what do you think of Kelly now?
- I think she was great.

41:31.155 --> 41:34.056
But did she actually say she wishes
there were more people like Steve?

41:34.225 --> 41:36.318
Oh, what a concept.

41:37.895 --> 41:39.362
There's John Sears.

41:39.530 --> 41:41.589
That guy just does not get the picture,
does he?

41:41.765 --> 41:44.700
I had no idea you were
such a powerful public speaker.

41:44.869 --> 41:48.703
Well, why don't you add it to the long
list of things that you don't know?

41:48.873 --> 41:51.205
Hey, Kelly. Give peace a chance.

41:52.009 --> 41:56.309
- Maybe in another lifetime, huh?
- Dylan, do you want a piece of pie?

42:01.886 --> 42:04.320
I'm reaching out to you here, Kelly,
come on.

42:05.189 --> 42:08.158
- Want some?
- You're a dead man.

42:08.325 --> 42:10.190
Yeah, you want some? Come on.

42:10.361 --> 42:11.885
- I'm gonna hunt you down!
- Right here!

42:12.062 --> 42:15.190
Keep your back to the wall, McKay.
You're dead!

42:17.368 --> 42:20.804
You are crazy. But thank you.

42:22.039 --> 42:23.870
My pleasure.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.411
Like a moth to a flame.

42:31.582 --> 42:33.743
Can you get off that thing?
We got a major problem here.

42:33.918 --> 42:35.749
Oh, no, you've been reading Freud,
haven't you?

42:35.920 --> 42:38.081
Will you be serious for once?

42:39.490 --> 42:41.788
D'Shawn saw us here yesterday.

42:41.959 --> 42:43.756
- Yeah, so he saw us.
- So he knows.

42:43.928 --> 42:45.293
He says
he's gonna tell your husband

42:45.462 --> 42:48.056
unless I take his sociology test
for him.

42:48.232 --> 42:50.598
So take the stupid test.
It was probably the deal anyway.

42:51.435 --> 42:53.062
What deal?

42:53.237 --> 42:54.761
Brandon, you are so naive.

42:55.272 --> 42:57.365
Why do you think
my husband's being so nice to you?

42:57.541 --> 43:00.806
Why do you think the exam's
a take-home for God's sake?

43:02.012 --> 43:03.138
I don't know what to say.

43:03.814 --> 43:06.044
Say you'll stop being a baby
and start playing your part.

43:06.216 --> 43:07.945
Meaning run around
behind your husband's back

43:08.118 --> 43:09.676
and write D'Shawn's test for him?

43:09.853 --> 43:12.014
Well, yeah, it would make things
a hell of a lot easier.

43:12.590 --> 43:15.184
Sorry, I kind of like doing things
the hard way.

43:15.359 --> 43:17.020
Hey, Brandon.

43:18.262 --> 43:21.322
- You want some advice?
- No.

43:24.702 --> 43:26.260
Okay.

43:44.588 --> 43:46.317
What's with the bag?

43:46.490 --> 43:49.584
Since Mom and Dad went out already,
will you just tell them I went camping?

43:49.760 --> 43:50.988
- Where to?
- I don't know.

43:51.929 --> 43:53.863
Well, I think they'll want
more details than that.

43:54.031 --> 43:57.262
- Are you in trouble?
- Nothing I can't handle.

43:57.434 --> 44:01.063
You know, I always hear people
talk about how they need their space.

44:01.238 --> 44:02.262
Now I know what they mean.

44:03.207 --> 44:05.732
Do you need any help?
I mean, I know a lot about running off.

44:08.345 --> 44:10.836
Have I ever told you
what a great chick you are?

44:11.582 --> 44:12.776
Not in so many words.

44:13.951 --> 44:15.919
Must be a reason for that.

44:16.387 --> 44:20.619
- Call collect, I'll accept the charges.
- All right, I'll keep in touch.
