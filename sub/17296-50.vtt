00:26.113 --> 00:28.245
One hundred!

00:29.942 --> 00:31.379
We are jacked, bros.

00:31.422 --> 00:32.945
Super jacked, bros!

00:34.425 --> 00:37.080
Gonna need some bro-tein
after that work out sesh.

00:41.476 --> 00:42.564
Ah.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.569
Ew! Use a napkin.

00:47.612 --> 00:48.787
No way!

00:48.831 --> 00:50.441
If this burger
don't make lots of drips,

00:50.485 --> 00:52.965
it don't belong near my lips.

00:54.924 --> 00:56.621
You are so right, bro!

00:58.232 --> 01:01.539
Will you be doing the
brother out for much longer?

01:01.583 --> 01:04.107
Only for the rest
of our lives, girl!

01:05.543 --> 01:07.850
Bros, bros, bros, bros!

01:14.900 --> 01:17.251
Can you at least
be bros somewhere else?

01:17.294 --> 01:18.426
It's annoying.

01:18.469 --> 01:20.254
Is saving the world annoying?

01:20.297 --> 01:21.603
Didn't think so.

01:21.646 --> 01:24.388
From what danger
must the world be saved?

01:24.432 --> 01:26.782
The Bropocalypse!

01:26.825 --> 01:30.786
Every 2,000 years, the Bro God
sends down an intergalactic fist bump

01:30.829 --> 01:32.657
to the top of Mount Brosuvius

01:32.701 --> 01:34.181
And the ultimate bro

01:34.224 --> 01:36.879
has to reciprocate
said fist bump.

01:39.055 --> 01:41.231
It's super sick.

01:41.275 --> 01:44.191
But if the Bro God is left
hanging, he will bring upon...

01:44.234 --> 01:46.410
The Bropocalypse.

01:46.454 --> 01:48.543
Backward hats, popped collars

01:48.586 --> 01:51.937
and puka shell necklaces
will cease to exist.

01:53.069 --> 01:54.201
Uh, good!

01:54.244 --> 01:56.159
Oh, we look forward to the day.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.814
Also, the world
will be destroyed.

02:02.470 --> 02:04.298
You're joking.

02:04.341 --> 02:06.213
Do we look like we're joking?

02:07.605 --> 02:09.694
Now, if you'll excuse us,

02:09.738 --> 02:11.870
these bros have a world to save.

02:11.914 --> 02:12.915
But first...

02:14.134 --> 02:15.787
One last power-lift.

02:19.226 --> 02:20.531
Swole!

02:24.622 --> 02:27.321
Worst-case scenario!

02:27.364 --> 02:30.062
Come on, bros.

02:30.106 --> 02:31.194
Walk it off.

02:33.109 --> 02:35.677
Bros, I... I can't walks.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.984
That means we won't
be able to stop...

02:39.028 --> 02:41.726
The Bropocalypse!

02:41.770 --> 02:44.251
Oh, darn. I guess that's the
end of all your dumb bro ways.

02:44.294 --> 02:45.643
No more backward hats.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.863
They should only be
worn the front ways.

02:48.994 --> 02:50.474
No more extreme sports.

02:50.518 --> 02:52.433
I prefer sports to be the mild.

02:52.476 --> 02:55.392
And no more getting food all
over your face when you eat.

02:55.436 --> 02:57.351
The shameful!

02:57.394 --> 02:59.179
That ain't a world
worth livin' in.

02:59.222 --> 03:02.007
If we can't bro ourselves
out of these injuries,

03:02.051 --> 03:04.880
there won't be a world
to live in at all.

03:06.098 --> 03:07.317
Oh, come on!

03:07.361 --> 03:08.971
The world isn't really gonna end

03:09.014 --> 03:11.234
because you can't bro out
on top of a mountain.

03:13.323 --> 03:16.021
There is a magnetic disturbance
coming from above this mountain range.

03:16.065 --> 03:18.502
That's not just
any mountain, that's...

03:18.546 --> 03:20.417
Mount Brosuvius.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.334
Uh, this says
"Mount San Antonio."

03:24.378 --> 03:26.075
Brosuvius!

03:26.118 --> 03:29.121
If the energy from the magnetic
disturbance is not dispersed,

03:29.165 --> 03:31.167
the world will be destroyed.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.473
I can't believe this.

03:32.516 --> 03:34.214
It'll really be...

03:34.257 --> 03:35.606
The Bropocalypse.

03:35.650 --> 03:36.999
Don't worry, ladies.

03:37.042 --> 03:39.219
The ultimate bros
will handle it.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.702
Stay down, knuckleheads.
We'll do it.

03:44.746 --> 03:46.574
But you ain't bros, bro!

03:46.617 --> 03:50.404
Does one not simply need to Don
Cornelius the clothing of the bros?

03:50.447 --> 03:52.754
And call each other
"bro" all the time?

03:52.797 --> 03:55.974
It will take more than that
to become the ultimate bro.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.282
Yo, bro!

03:59.326 --> 04:00.588
Yo, the brother.

04:00.631 --> 04:01.719
Yo, I like your
sweet chain wallet.

04:01.763 --> 04:03.112
What is up, the man?

04:03.155 --> 04:04.374
Hey, care to
catch some waves, brah?

04:04.418 --> 04:05.419
Ooh, the messy eating.

04:05.462 --> 04:06.507
Take it to the hoop.

04:06.550 --> 04:07.682
The pungent, pungent odor.

04:07.725 --> 04:09.249
Check out that chick.

04:09.292 --> 04:11.642
Ooh, the chickens are so nice.

04:11.686 --> 04:14.297
Eh, it's a start, young bros.

04:14.341 --> 04:18.214
But becoming the ultimate bro isn't
as easy as popping your collar.

04:18.258 --> 04:21.435
Bein' a bro
comes from right in here.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.001
This is our bro journal.

04:23.045 --> 04:25.874
It will guide you,
on your bro journey.

04:25.917 --> 04:28.311
Good luck, young bros.
And remember...

04:28.355 --> 04:32.620
A bro is no bro with no bros.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.709
I do not know what that means.

04:34.752 --> 04:36.450
You will, young bros.

04:36.493 --> 04:37.886
You will.

04:37.929 --> 04:40.062
Whatever.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.339
I think my neck
is getting sunburned.

04:56.383 --> 04:59.081
Perhaps you could try
the popping of the collar.

05:02.519 --> 05:06.523
Whoa, my neck is fully protected
from the sun's harmful rays.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.220
Good call...

05:08.264 --> 05:09.613
Bro.

05:09.657 --> 05:12.268
No the problem, the bro.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.538
It is the end that is dead.

05:21.582 --> 05:22.800
Let's see.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.367
"To pass through the face,

05:24.411 --> 05:25.673
"get it all over the place."

05:31.940 --> 05:35.291
It's the ultimate bro burger.

05:35.335 --> 05:39.600
That is the excessive amount of the
meats, cheeses and the breads.

05:39.643 --> 05:42.211
We got this, bro.

06:04.668 --> 06:06.148
Sick, bro.

06:09.499 --> 06:11.414
They're not answering when
I try to hit 'em up, bros.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.285
Something musta happened.

06:13.329 --> 06:15.984
I knews them little bros wasn't
up for this kind of bro thing.

06:16.027 --> 06:18.726
Then it's up to
these big bros to save them

06:18.769 --> 06:20.641
and the world.

06:22.469 --> 06:25.428
If only there was a way to
quickly heal our leg injuries.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.169
Hold up, I gots it.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.435
I seen this in a movie one time.

06:35.525 --> 06:37.005
It's working.

06:38.702 --> 06:41.226
My knee is feeling bro-tastic.

06:41.270 --> 06:42.793
Fist bump!

06:54.892 --> 06:58.287
"A bro is no bro
with no bros."

06:58.330 --> 07:00.463
I still don't know
what that means.

07:00.507 --> 07:01.725
According to the journal,

07:01.769 --> 07:04.075
this is a statue
of the first bro

07:04.119 --> 07:06.469
to do the fist bumping
with the bro gods

07:06.513 --> 07:07.992
The ultimate bro.

07:08.645 --> 07:09.690
Wait.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.343
Something isn't right.

07:11.387 --> 07:14.912
I think this lion needs to
chickity-check himself, bro.

07:26.533 --> 07:27.534
Whoa.

07:31.712 --> 07:33.627
This looks extreme.

07:33.670 --> 07:34.802
Indeed.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.499
Not at all the mild.

07:36.543 --> 07:39.763
"The way forward will open for
the bro with the sickest jumps."

07:39.807 --> 07:41.504
Let us do the it...

07:41.939 --> 07:43.201
Bro.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.039
Almost there, bro.

07:56.084 --> 07:59.261
- The bike chain!
- No of the worries, bro!

08:04.353 --> 08:05.354
Sick!

08:10.402 --> 08:12.883
Bros! Bros! Bros! Bros!

08:14.189 --> 08:16.278
We're running out of time, bros.

08:16.321 --> 08:19.673
Ah! I can't scrub
our injuries out no more!

08:19.716 --> 08:21.718
My hands be broken.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.067
Are you bros forgetting

08:23.111 --> 08:25.113
that Tiger Woods
won the U.S. Open

08:25.156 --> 08:27.202
with a bro-ken leg

08:27.245 --> 08:29.073
and torn ACL?

08:29.117 --> 08:32.599
A true bro knows
pain is all in the mind.

08:32.642 --> 08:35.166
Get up! Let's go, bros!

08:38.126 --> 08:39.562
It's workin', bros.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.912
Baby, I ain't feelin' no pain.

08:41.956 --> 08:43.827
Chest bump!

08:45.437 --> 08:47.483
My heart.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.317
What now?

08:55.360 --> 08:58.625
"A bro is no bro
with no bros."

08:58.668 --> 09:00.496
That doesn't help.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.498
How are we supposed to know which
one of us is the ultimate bro?

09:03.630 --> 09:05.327
It is obviously you, bro.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.634
You have fully
annihilated the mission.

09:07.677 --> 09:08.852
Me what?

09:08.896 --> 09:10.550
You have killed it
this whole journey, bro.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.161
How can I be the ultimate bro

09:13.204 --> 09:14.815
when you clearly have
the better bro-tential?

09:14.858 --> 09:16.381
Listen, bro,

09:16.425 --> 09:19.994
there is no chance you
are not the ultimate bro, bro!

09:20.037 --> 09:21.082
All right, bro...

09:21.125 --> 09:22.344
It's cool, bro.

09:23.301 --> 09:25.347
I'm going for it, bro!

09:28.611 --> 09:30.352
Bro, it's not poppin' off, bro.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.354
I blew it, bro, we're doomed.

09:32.397 --> 09:35.183
At least we will be crushed together.

09:35.226 --> 09:36.837
Wait, that's it.

09:36.880 --> 09:40.362
"A bro is no bro
with no bros."

09:40.405 --> 09:41.798
I finally understand it.

09:41.842 --> 09:45.019
It means we are
the ultimate bro, bro.

09:45.062 --> 09:46.324
Take my hand!

09:48.152 --> 09:49.589
Bump it, bro!

09:52.766 --> 09:56.726
You know, bein' a bro
isn't so bad after all, bro.

09:56.770 --> 10:00.904
I'm proud to call
you my bro, bro.

10:00.948 --> 10:02.384
Hold on!

10:04.865 --> 10:05.909
We're here.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.607
We made it, mama-bros!

10:07.650 --> 10:11.132
The ultimate bros
are here to save the world!

10:11.175 --> 10:12.742
Bros! Bros! Bros! Bros!

10:12.786 --> 10:15.919
Hmm... On second thought,
being a bro is terrible.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.312
Agreed.

10:18.182 --> 10:19.836
Ultimate bros!
