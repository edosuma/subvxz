coffee filters, knives,
popcorn, and fork teeth.

48:04.314 --> 48:07.850

I really understood it.

48:21.532 --> 48:24.933

the execution falls

a little more polish,

with ordering a lot of takeout.

So I'm very familiar with the
plastic bags and the thank you.

50:04.468 --> 50:07.436

50:56.220 --> 50:58.353
I see the text still
working the machine.

50:58.421 --> 51:01.057
I knew that there was the
material that I wanted to use.

51:01.059 --> 51:03.259
And there's like
a lot of cutouts.

51:03.326 --> 51:06.161
That way the straws
can have movement.

51:06.229 --> 51:07.563
- So these are not hot-glued on?

51:07.630 --> 51:09.132
- No, no.
- This is--you sewed each one

51:09.198 --> 51:10.766
of these straws?
- I've been sitting in

51:10.834 --> 51:12.601
the machine like 15 hours.

51:12.669 --> 51:15.237
The whole dress have no glue.

51:15.305 --> 51:17.506
- Is the corset boned?
- We didn't have bones,

51:17.574 --> 51:20.175

51:31.321 --> 51:35.591
That is a person

51:35.593 --> 51:38.894
Every element of this
should have gone wrong,

51:38.896 --> 51:42.298
but it was sensational
from top to bottom,

51:42.365 --> 51:45.734
including the hair,
the shoes, the bag.

51:45.736 --> 51:48.237

I love a comeback story.

51:48.304 --> 51:50.539
I can't believe
you almost went home.

51:50.607 --> 51:52.642

52:09.292 --> 52:11.426

52:56.606 --> 52:59.007
- When I went to the bar
and I saw the doilies,

52:59.075 --> 53:00.275
it reminded me of something

53:00.277 --> 53:01.410
that you will find
in the island.

53:01.477 --> 53:03.012
We use a lot
of old vintage lace.

53:03.079 --> 53:06.683
I didn't use the entire thing.
I just cut the laces out

53:06.749 --> 53:08.418
and then really place
them there,

53:08.484 --> 53:10.886
do the flowers and the bottom.
And then as I come up,

53:10.954 --> 53:14.423
really stretch them to create
the--detail.

53:14.491 --> 53:16.625
I really wanted
to give her a fit,

53:16.627 --> 53:18.494
and I really do love the dress.

53:18.496 --> 53:19.828
- Did you ombre the dress

53:19.830 --> 53:21.430
once it was
already fully constructed?

53:21.497 --> 53:23.500
- Once I was done,
I stepped back.

53:23.566 --> 53:25.701
I realized it was gonna turn
into a carnival float.

53:25.768 --> 53:28.237
So I just decided to unbraid
the bottom in the pink,

53:28.305 --> 53:29.504
but it did take a lot of time.

53:29.572 --> 53:31.840
So I did do this part
at the end.

53:31.842 --> 53:32.641
- Risky.
- But, like,

53:32.709 --> 53:34.776
I think there was a lightness
to it

53:34.844 --> 53:37.579
and a happiness to it
that I responded to.

53:37.647 --> 53:41.984
And I think there were
some fit issues,

53:41.986 --> 53:45.854
but I think also you're working
with the pleather underneath,

53:45.856 --> 53:50.593
which besides the doily
is I think the issue.

53:50.660 --> 53:51.928
- I personally kind of
like the direction

53:51.995 --> 53:56.598
that you were taking this look;
the thoughtfulness that you had

53:56.666 --> 54:00.603
while applying the doilies
onto the garment was nice.

54:00.670 --> 54:04.040
But I wish that the bottom of
the dress was pegged even more.

54:04.107 --> 54:06.475
Can I see the back of it?

54:06.543 --> 54:09.077
I mean, I think you still
could have pegged it even more

54:09.145 --> 54:10.546
and just put the foot higher

54:10.548 --> 54:12.414
so she could have
had more mobility.

54:12.482 --> 54:14.417
- The fit at the waistline

54:14.419 --> 54:15.952
<i>wasn't flattering on your model.</i>

54:16.019 --> 54:18.821
<i>If the dress was gonna be
so straight on the bottom,</i>

54:18.888 --> 54:21.490
then maybe showing more skin
here would've felt like,

54:21.557 --> 54:23.558
okay, we're still
flattering her body.

54:23.626 --> 54:25.494
So I'm curious
if that was in intentional

54:25.561 --> 54:26.828
or if that was a result

54:26.896 --> 54:28.830
of how challenging
it was to use this fabric?

54:28.898 --> 54:30.832
- I'm from a very
conservative country

54:30.900 --> 54:33.769
that we don't show up front
if our backs are showing,

54:33.771 --> 54:35.271
we don't show our backs
if our front showing.

54:35.339 --> 54:37.473
So that's my design aesthetic.

54:37.540 --> 54:39.442
- I love what you did
with the ombre.

54:39.509 --> 54:44.212
And I like the fact
that you chose the doilies

54:44.280 --> 54:48.717
to mimic lace.
Where I think you missed,

54:48.719 --> 54:53.489
I think she was drowning
in so much doilies.

54:53.491 --> 54:57.793
The end result needed
some more work.

54:57.795 --> 55:02.665
- Thank you, Prajjé.
You can leave the runway.

55:02.732 --> 55:05.567

55:10.341 --> 55:13.875
- Okay. Kristina,
how did you make this?

55:13.943 --> 55:16.846
- So this is all
plastic sequins flowers.

55:16.913 --> 55:21.116
I create with a lighter
and plastic cups

55:21.184 --> 55:22.551
and plastic containers.

55:22.619 --> 55:26.556
And I use also
aluminum containers.

55:26.622 --> 55:32.628
And I cut the leaf shapes,
and I created peacock feathers

55:32.630 --> 55:36.031
inspired by Elaine's blouse
last time.

55:36.099 --> 55:37.634

55:37.700 --> 55:39.902
- That's why was like,
where have I seen them before?

55:39.969 --> 55:42.038
And you made the feather
from aluminum as well?

55:42.105 --> 55:44.239
- Yeah.

55:44.307 --> 55:45.974
- Wow, I'm shook.

55:45.976 --> 55:47.375
- I know. I'm shook.

55:47.377 --> 55:49.478
- And what's the base
of the dress?

55:49.546 --> 55:51.047
- The mesh from the bar.

55:51.114 --> 55:53.415
- How are the sequins applied?
- I use the glue gun.

55:53.417 --> 55:56.251
The most edge part,
I put the glue,

55:56.319 --> 55:58.520
and I attach it to the base.

55:58.522 --> 56:00.255
- You can, like, obviously see

Also the noise, obsessed.

an afterthought.

57:51.835 --> 57:55.036
It was so done from such
a feminine point of view.

58:36.012 --> 58:39.314

58:44.154 --> 58:47.256

was kind of incredible.</i>

58:47.323 --> 58:50.959
- Up close I have to concede
it was not perfect,

58:50.961 --> 58:53.028

it moved down the runway.

58:53.096 --> 58:56.031
I loved that
flouncy A-line skirt.

- Just nice?

58:58.601 --> 59:01.036
- I thought it was nice.

59:01.104 --> 59:03.606

her model's gorgeous curves,

59:06.310 --> 59:10.946

from our boy Prajjé today.

<i>I liked the idea of using
doilies to create lace,</i>

59:15.119 --> 59:19.487

dress was like a paper bag.

59:19.555 --> 59:23.891

59:26.429 --> 59:28.196
He cut up a whole leather couch.

59:28.198 --> 59:30.932
- Which made his look
look really stiff.

I didn't know what Anna was
trying to say with this look.

59:44.214 --> 59:46.081
- I completely disagree.

59:46.148 --> 59:50.820
She was the only person on this
runway that created a print.

59:50.886 --> 59:54.489
I think that she brought
in her roots

59:54.557 --> 59:56.558
with the shape
of the silhouette.

59:56.626 --> 59:58.159
I thought it was clever.

59:58.227 --> 1:00:00.228
The length was nice,
and the little slit was nice,

1:00:00.230 --> 1:00:03.498
but it just felt convoluted.
It was the worst for me.

1:00:03.566 --> 1:00:06.835

who are in the bottom,

1:00:09.172 --> 1:00:10.772

1:00:10.840 --> 1:00:11.973
It was only nuanced.

1:00:11.975 --> 1:00:15.043

started, "It was fantastic."

1:00:15.045 --> 1:00:16.645

it was fantastic.

want to send home?
