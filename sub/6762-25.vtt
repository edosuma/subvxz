01:35.129 --> 01:36.504
All right, l get it.

01:36.714 --> 01:38.588
The electrons get deflected
by the nucleus

01:38.758 --> 01:41.166
after they pass through
the cathode ray, right?

01:43.014 --> 01:44.971
Dylan, no, don't look at me like that.

01:45.142 --> 01:47.550
- Like what?
- Dylan, stop.

01:47.770 --> 01:49.644
Stop what? What am l doing?

01:49.857 --> 01:53.938
You know exactly what you're doing.
And you do it so well.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.403
Dylan, come on.

01:59.995 --> 02:02.533
What can l say?
Studying brings out the best in me.

02:02.707 --> 02:04.332
Yeah, well, you're not studying.

02:04.501 --> 02:07.871
Oh, yes, l am.
l'm just not studying radioactivity.

02:08.048 --> 02:10.255
Dylan, the midterm is on Friday.

02:10.425 --> 02:14.045
l know. We have days, Brenda.

02:14.932 --> 02:17.388
- You're so--
- What, organized?

02:17.560 --> 02:20.764
- No, l was gonna say--
- Prepared.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.648
More like obsessed.

02:23.402 --> 02:25.276
Why,
because l don't wing it like you

02:25.446 --> 02:27.486
or cram the night before
like Brandon does?

02:27.657 --> 02:29.946
No, because you study all the time.

02:30.119 --> 02:32.955
No, l used to study all the time.

02:33.123 --> 02:35.531
But lately,
something's been distracting me.

02:35.710 --> 02:38.628
Hey, don't blame me.
lt's just chemistry.

02:38.797 --> 02:42.416
No, it's physics. And this is history.

02:43.846 --> 02:46.420
Well, obviously we're not gonna get
anything accomplished here.

02:46.599 --> 02:48.806
So l think we should go
to a public place.

02:48.978 --> 02:51.101
Some place preferably very well lit.

02:52.566 --> 02:55.057
Not the library.

03:01.328 --> 03:03.819
Tertiary, Cretaceous,
Jurassic, Devonian.

03:03.998 --> 03:06.953
No. Tertiary, Jurassic,
Cretaceous, Triassic.

03:07.127 --> 03:08.752
- lt kind of rhymes.
- Right.

03:08.921 --> 03:10.581
Why don't they teach us
something useful?

03:10.757 --> 03:13.331
When am l gonna need to know
the Moors were driven from Spain?

03:13.511 --> 03:16.049
How about Friday, 1 0 a.m.?

03:16.556 --> 03:17.884
l hate midterms.

03:18.058 --> 03:21.392
l love them.
Midterms, finals, term papers.

03:21.563 --> 03:22.761
When the library closes,

03:22.940 --> 03:27.318
all the kids from Beverly
and West Beverly come straight here.

03:27.488 --> 03:28.651
Oh, you leaving so soon?

03:28.865 --> 03:31.321
No, l have another 45 minutes
till l can go home.

03:31.493 --> 03:32.904
l just need change for the jukebox.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.611
See why all the kids come here?
Because you need good food

03:35.791 --> 03:38.627
and good music
to free your mind up for studying.

03:38.795 --> 03:40.254
Who said anything about studying?

03:40.463 --> 03:42.871
l'm waiting for Mel, Jackie
and their wedding coordinator

03:43.050 --> 03:45.292
to finish choosing
their colour scheme.

03:47.056 --> 03:49.049
Come on.

03:51.395 --> 03:53.637
- lt's all in the wrist, pal.
- Oh, l owe you one.

03:53.815 --> 03:56.141
Does that mean
l don't have to stay for recycling?

03:56.318 --> 04:00.648
No. They're gonna be here
first thing in the morning, but nice try.

04:01.784 --> 04:06.114
Tertiary, Cretaceous,
Jurassic, Triassic. That's it.

04:06.290 --> 04:08.366
- Hey, guys, look out.
- Wait a sec, Bran. Okay.

04:08.585 --> 04:10.792
A equals B. C equals D.

04:10.963 --> 04:14.249
So AC over BD equals one.

04:15.928 --> 04:18.418
Wow, now l know
why you're doing so well in this class.

04:19.057 --> 04:22.557
Yeah, well, l guess it gets easier
the second time around.

04:23.939 --> 04:25.683
Yeah, Bren, l can see

04:25.858 --> 04:28.065
we're definitely gonna get
a lot of studying done here.

04:28.278 --> 04:31.066
Well, whatever it is,
it'll be an improvement.

04:31.240 --> 04:33.114
Now, l have to go ask
Andrea a question.

04:33.284 --> 04:36.202
So why don't you take a seat,
order me a Coke and l'll be right there?

04:36.706 --> 04:38.117
Yes, ma'am.

04:38.792 --> 04:41.462
And l love you.

04:46.052 --> 04:48.804
Tertiary, Cretaceous,
Jurassic, Triassic.

04:56.733 --> 04:59.438
Okay, that's it for me.

04:59.611 --> 05:01.818
You guys are actually gonna leave
so l can close up?

05:01.990 --> 05:04.279
No, l have to finish this chapter.

05:04.451 --> 05:05.696
Must be hormonal.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.495
No, it's cerebral.

05:07.664 --> 05:09.491
l can't believe you guys
don't know this stuff

05:09.667 --> 05:11.576
backwards and forwards by now.

05:11.753 --> 05:13.461
And what if they ask it sideways?

05:13.672 --> 05:14.952
Brenda doesn't like surprises.

05:15.174 --> 05:16.918
And Steve
doesn't like beating a dead horse.

05:17.093 --> 05:19.086
Can we go, Professor Zuckerman?

05:19.263 --> 05:21.137
Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?

05:22.517 --> 05:25.305
- Good nighty.
- Good night.

05:25.980 --> 05:27.011
Speaking of which,

05:27.190 --> 05:30.275
when do you suppose our
estimated time of departure is, Bren?

05:30.444 --> 05:31.523
Fifteen minutes?

05:31.738 --> 05:34.194
That'll give you enough time
to help me with the recycling.

05:34.742 --> 05:36.569
You got it.

05:38.330 --> 05:40.868
So...gonna be here when l get back?

05:41.042 --> 05:44.708
Unless l run off
with some tall handsome stranger.

05:53.517 --> 05:54.892
Anytime now.

05:55.395 --> 05:58.065
Okay, boss.

06:09.372 --> 06:10.535
You scared me.

06:10.707 --> 06:12.332
Sorry. Steve forgot his CliffsNotes.

06:12.543 --> 06:15.117
- Well, at least he reads something.
- Actually, he doesn't.

06:15.296 --> 06:18.630
He likes to put them under his pillow
and hopes he'll learn it by osmosis.

06:18.801 --> 06:22.218
- l'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay, take care. Bye.

06:32.486 --> 06:34.395
Ladies and gentlemen,
live under the big top,

06:34.572 --> 06:36.612
it's those nutty Gambini Brothers.

06:36.784 --> 06:38.064
Come on.

07:00.983 --> 07:03.309
So, what did you forget this time?

07:03.486 --> 07:05.230
Andrea?

07:07.074 --> 07:10.278
You do what l tell you
and you won't get hurt.

07:10.454 --> 07:11.699
Do you understand?

07:12.373 --> 07:13.915
Oh, God.

07:14.084 --> 07:17.039
Do you understand?

07:17.213 --> 07:18.588
Just put the gun down, okay?

07:18.798 --> 07:21.420
Damn it! Do you understand me?
Do you?

07:22.470 --> 07:23.501
Yes.

07:24.014 --> 07:25.389
ls there anyone else here?

07:26.517 --> 07:28.261
Answer me!

07:28.812 --> 07:29.843
Yes.

07:31.482 --> 07:33.024
Where?

07:34.862 --> 07:35.977
Out back.

07:40.536 --> 07:43.621
You scream, you die.

07:45.751 --> 07:47.958
Go open the register.

07:50.508 --> 07:53.130
- Hurry up!
- Okay. Just be cool, all right?

07:53.303 --> 07:55.177
Hurry up!

07:57.392 --> 07:58.507
Quit stalling!

07:58.727 --> 08:00.387
l'm not! lt sticks sometimes.

08:00.604 --> 08:03.475
- Well, l guess l'll just have to open it.
- No!

08:03.650 --> 08:05.857
Good girl. Put the money in the bag.

08:10.701 --> 08:12.409
Faster.

08:20.673 --> 08:22.500
You know, you're kind of cute.

08:28.767 --> 08:32.895
Don't say thank you when someone
pays you a compliment?

08:33.816 --> 08:37.232
- Thank you.
- l can't hear you.

08:38.697 --> 08:41.235
Thank you.

08:41.451 --> 08:43.573
Get down on the ground.

08:43.787 --> 08:46.195
- l said, get down on the ground!
- Please don't hurt me.

08:46.374 --> 08:49.044
l said, get down on the ground!

08:51.381 --> 08:53.670
Now, when l say go,
you start counting.

08:53.843 --> 08:56.002
Loud, so that l can hear you.

08:56.179 --> 08:58.551
Then you forget that you ever saw me.
You got it?

08:59.350 --> 09:01.224
- Yes.
- Go.

09:01.394 --> 09:03.054
One. Two.

09:03.272 --> 09:05.312
l can't hear you!

09:06.735 --> 09:10.520
Three. Four. Five.

09:10.740 --> 09:12.531
All right, here we go. Hey, hey.

09:12.701 --> 09:15.109
Forget it, forget it. Here, Coke.

09:18.459 --> 09:19.953
Well...

09:20.754 --> 09:23.755
Hope Mr. Barnum
doesn't find out about this.

09:24.968 --> 09:27.210
Man, do you hear something?

09:28.014 --> 09:30.007
Like what?

09:30.183 --> 09:31.677
Never mind.

09:31.852 --> 09:34.474
Get that. Give me that broom.

09:35.816 --> 09:37.061
You gotta check Baja out, man.

09:37.234 --> 09:38.894
You don't have to surf.
You can just hang.

09:39.070 --> 09:41.229
- Where is it?
- lt's on the other side of San Diego.

09:41.407 --> 09:43.696
Come on, woman. Time's up.

09:49.209 --> 09:51.036
- Bren?
- Brenda?

09:53.923 --> 09:55.002
Bren.

09:55.175 --> 09:58.675
Okay? Here, here, here. lt's okay.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.847
So, what we have is a white male,
late teens, early 20s,

10:06.023 --> 10:08.016
perhaps late 20s,
wearing a hat, right?

10:08.234 --> 10:09.265
Well, l'm sorry.

10:09.444 --> 10:12.018
l mean, l was looking at him
but all l could see was the gun.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.651
Don't worry about it. You did okay.

10:13.825 --> 10:15.450
- She did great.
- She sure did.

10:15.953 --> 10:18.623
Now, you two were out in the back
with the garbage.

10:18.790 --> 10:22.373
- You heard nothing?
- Yeah, lot of help we were, huh?

10:22.587 --> 10:24.876
lf you were here,
he might have just started shooting.

10:25.090 --> 10:28.341
Brenda, if we were here, he wouldn't
have come in the first place.

10:28.511 --> 10:30.718
l knew l should've put in
that video camera.

10:30.890 --> 10:33.428
What might have helped
is if the door had been locked.

10:33.602 --> 10:36.438
- l know, l know.
- lt wasn't his fault.

10:36.647 --> 10:38.806
How was he supposed to know
that creep was out there?

10:38.984 --> 10:41.939
Look, no one was hurt,
and that's the important thing.

10:42.113 --> 10:44.070
lt's only money.

10:44.241 --> 10:45.404
l'm sorry, Nat.

10:45.618 --> 10:48.952
Why? Were you in on it?

10:49.122 --> 10:50.664
Did he steal my recipes?

10:51.876 --> 10:54.961
Come on, it's okay. lt's okay.

10:55.172 --> 10:57.710
Officer, what are the chances
of catching this guy?

10:57.926 --> 11:01.212
Well, we don't have any decent prints
and not much of a description.

11:01.431 --> 11:03.887
We'll run it against the m.o.'s
in the computer.

11:04.101 --> 11:06.308
- Something may turn up.
- Okay.

11:06.521 --> 11:09.095
Sounds like you handled
all this very well, Ms. Walsh.

11:09.316 --> 11:11.143
A lot of people
would've lost their cool.

11:11.319 --> 11:13.941
You did everything just right. Okay?

11:14.573 --> 11:15.604
Okay.

11:20.873 --> 11:23.958
- Dad.
- Are you okay?

11:24.170 --> 11:25.914
You don't need us anymore tonight,
do you?

11:26.089 --> 11:27.880
- No, go home.
- Thanks.

11:29.427 --> 11:32.594
Come on, honey. lt's all over now.

11:32.764 --> 11:34.258
Maybe not.

11:34.475 --> 11:36.717
Bren, where's your purse?

11:41.651 --> 11:44.652
Honey, l told you, we'll change
all the locks first thing in the morning.

11:44.822 --> 11:47.194
Well, l think we should put in
a new alarm system too.

11:47.367 --> 11:49.027
Yeah,
hopefully one that works this time.

11:49.203 --> 11:51.196
You guys, don't worry.
He is not coming here.

11:51.373 --> 11:53.995
Yeah, but if he wanted to, he could.
He's got Brenda's keys,

11:54.210 --> 11:56.001
he's got her licence
with the address on it.

11:56.171 --> 11:58.378
No, man, look.
He took the cash, dumped the purse.

11:58.549 --> 11:59.924
Never even looked at the lD.

12:00.093 --> 12:01.967
Dylan's right.
lf he'd wanted to harm you,

12:02.137 --> 12:04.011
he would've done it
when he had the chance.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.213
- Jim--
- Honey--

12:05.392 --> 12:08.228
Brenda, we promise you one thing:
we'll never leave you alone again.

12:08.396 --> 12:11.101
- Absolutely.
- Come on, it was just a fluke thing.

12:11.274 --> 12:13.101
l was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

12:13.611 --> 12:14.774
Pretty good attitude.

12:14.988 --> 12:17.314
You know, you've handled
this whole thing like a trouper.

12:17.491 --> 12:18.522
We're very proud of you.

12:18.701 --> 12:21.489
But we're not surprised.
Do you remember Mr. Pony?

12:21.705 --> 12:22.868
Where is he, anyway?

12:23.082 --> 12:25.834
You never unpacked that box.
He's probably still in the garage.

12:26.044 --> 12:28.286
Whoa, wait, wait, wait. Mr. Pony?

12:28.506 --> 12:31.080
Well, when Brenda was little,
she used to ride every weekend.

12:31.260 --> 12:32.802
And she adored it.

12:32.970 --> 12:37.182
Until the horse got stung by a bee
and it ran off at top speed.

12:37.393 --> 12:38.673
Did she stay on?

12:38.895 --> 12:42.680
No, l fell off hard in the grass.

12:42.900 --> 12:44.560
Thank God nothing was broken,

12:45.195 --> 12:46.358
except for her spirit.

12:46.572 --> 12:48.529
Yeah, and l said l'd never ride again.

12:48.741 --> 12:50.401
She didn't wanna look
at another horse.

12:50.619 --> 12:53.823
So Dad went out and bought her
a little stuffed Mr. Pony.

12:54.708 --> 12:57.626
Gave her one of his famous
Walsh pep talks and lo and behold--

12:57.795 --> 12:59.871
- Very next weekend--
- She got back on the horse.

13:00.048 --> 13:01.079
You got it.

13:01.258 --> 13:03.251
Listen, it was a very telling thing.

13:03.762 --> 13:05.671
lt showed what kind
of character she had.

13:05.889 --> 13:08.178
You guys, it's not that big of a deal.

13:08.351 --> 13:09.382
l mean, my bruises healed,

13:09.561 --> 13:11.435
and l remembered
how much l loved to ride.

13:11.647 --> 13:15.266
Well, this is a very similar situation.
And we're all here to help you with it.

13:15.444 --> 13:16.986
Well,
l'm only worried about one thing.

13:17.155 --> 13:18.614
What's that?

13:18.782 --> 13:20.276
Well, since my licence was stolen,

13:20.451 --> 13:23.868
does that mean that l have to take
my driving test all over again?

13:30.756 --> 13:32.131
Bren...

13:32.801 --> 13:34.461
A friend of yours is here.

13:35.846 --> 13:37.471
Mr. Pony, you found him.

13:38.683 --> 13:41.055
Thought you might wanna see
your old buddy right about now.

13:41.270 --> 13:43.310
Thanks, Mom.

13:43.523 --> 13:47.142
Brenda, if you need us, we're here.

13:47.946 --> 13:49.061
l know.

13:49.239 --> 13:51.565
Don't worry,
l'll be fine after a good night's sleep.

13:51.784 --> 13:52.815
Okay, honey.

13:52.994 --> 13:56.114
l love you.
l'm just so glad you're okay.

13:56.708 --> 13:59.460
- Night, Mom.
- Night, honey.

14:45.815 --> 14:47.475
You know, you're kind of cute.

15:11.642 --> 15:14.264
Morning, dear.
Well, where's Brandon?

15:14.479 --> 15:16.021
Brandon said
he's skipping breakfast.

15:16.189 --> 15:20.057
He and his textbooks are spending
some quality cram time together.

15:20.237 --> 15:22.064
- How's Brenda?
- l didn't see her.

15:22.239 --> 15:23.698
She was in the shower.

15:23.866 --> 15:26.192
Didn't she take one last night?

15:26.370 --> 15:28.944
Never mind. l would too, l suppose.

15:29.123 --> 15:30.783
What's this?
''Women's Crisis Hotline''?

15:30.959 --> 15:33.082
The police inspector
gave that to Brenda last night.

15:33.254 --> 15:34.879
l know she said
she wasn't interested--

15:35.048 --> 15:37.337
Until she says otherwise,
let's not push it.

15:37.510 --> 15:38.885
He said they were very helpful

15:39.053 --> 15:41.010
in dealing with this kind
of emotional trauma.

15:41.181 --> 15:43.637
Listen, you start using words
like ''crisis'' and ''trauma''

15:43.810 --> 15:46.728
to a suggestible kid like Brenda,
she'll imagine herself crazy.

15:46.939 --> 15:48.599
Maybe you're right.

15:48.775 --> 15:51.812
Listen, she's got a lot of people
around her who love and support her.

15:51.987 --> 15:54.823
She's gonna come
through this just fine.

15:55.534 --> 15:58.239
Maybe l should call
the Women's Crisis Hotline.

15:58.454 --> 16:02.453
Hey,
we were all very lucky last night.

16:02.627 --> 16:04.418
She'll be okay.

16:04.629 --> 16:06.586
Morning.

16:06.757 --> 16:10.625
- How you doing?
- Fine. Shouldn't l be?

16:10.846 --> 16:13.847
Of course.
Did you get a good night's sleep?

16:14.059 --> 16:16.729
Yeah, sure. l slept great.

16:22.445 --> 16:25.696
Just think, if l'd stayed later last night,
it might've been both of us held up.

16:25.866 --> 16:27.740
l would've had a heart attack.
l'd be dead now.

16:27.911 --> 16:29.820
And you'd be walking
down this hall alone today.

16:29.997 --> 16:31.705
- Donna, l get the picture.
- Brenda.

16:33.084 --> 16:35.243
- Steve, hi. How are you?
- How are you?

16:35.463 --> 16:37.123
l stopped by the Peach Pit
for breakfast.

16:37.298 --> 16:39.624
Nat told me about the stickup.
l'm blown away.

16:40.135 --> 16:43.006
Yeah, well, l'm glad l wasn't. Bye.

16:51.526 --> 16:53.270
Whoa, Bren, you scared me.

16:53.445 --> 16:56.115
- Really? lt wasn't even loaded.
- Very funny.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.026
Well, you have to keep
your sense of humour.

16:58.243 --> 17:00.485
Yeah, l guess.
Mine kind of took a flyer.

17:00.663 --> 17:02.739
You know, l almost called you
at 2:00 this morning.

17:02.958 --> 17:06.078
l felt like l needed to do something.
Go after the guy, something.

17:06.296 --> 17:08.252
Dylan, it's over. You have to let it go.

17:09.215 --> 17:10.924
l really am sorry, Bren.

17:11.553 --> 17:14.340
lt wasn't your fault.
lt was nobody's fault. lt just happened.

17:15.098 --> 17:16.593
l wish it didn't happen to you.

17:24.654 --> 17:27.192
So...gonna be here when l get back?

17:27.366 --> 17:30.118
Unless l run off
with some tall handsome stranger.

17:33.582 --> 17:38.708
You do what l tell you
and you won't get hurt, understand?

17:40.967 --> 17:43.256
For whom the bell tolls.

17:43.429 --> 17:46.846
lt tolls for me if l don't read
Crime and Punishment by tomorrow.

17:47.017 --> 17:48.974
Yeah,
l have a few chapters to read myself.

17:49.187 --> 17:51.263
You got study hall this period.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.560
- Lucky me.
- Bye.

18:17.892 --> 18:19.932
You know, you're kind of cute.

18:20.812 --> 18:24.941
Don't say thank you when someone
pays you a compliment?

18:31.452 --> 18:34.619
Thought l'd never make it back in time.
There was so much traffic.

18:35.290 --> 18:36.832
- Where were you?
- The police station.

18:37.001 --> 18:39.373
Didn't Brandon tell you
l went to file a report?

18:39.546 --> 18:42.216
- Oh, yeah.
- You know, they were all really nice.

18:42.383 --> 18:45.338
Although they're not very optimistic
about catching the guy.

18:45.554 --> 18:47.013
You know,
l was meaning to ask you,

18:47.181 --> 18:49.589
are we responsible for Chapter 8
on the Physics midterm?

18:49.768 --> 18:52.224
- Yeah, but only up to page 95.
- Okay.

18:52.438 --> 18:54.929
l told the inspector
l only got a glimpse of the guy

18:55.108 --> 18:58.275
as l was getting into Steve's car
and it was dark outside the Peach Pit.

18:58.488 --> 19:01.324
But if your guy was wearing
a grey shirt and a baseball cap,

19:01.492 --> 19:02.690
it could've been the same one.

19:02.869 --> 19:04.577
Well, it probably was.

19:04.746 --> 19:06.026
Did your guy have brown hair?

19:06.248 --> 19:08.704
You know what? l don't remember
and he isn't ''my guy.''

19:10.462 --> 19:13.547
- l didn't mean it that way.
- Look, l know.

19:13.758 --> 19:16.047
l'm trying to forget about this
and get on with my life.

19:16.220 --> 19:19.506
lt's impossible to do that with everyone
yammering at me everywhere l go,

19:19.683 --> 19:21.557
like it's a bigger deal than it is.

19:22.687 --> 19:24.146
l'm sorry.

19:25.274 --> 19:27.812
lt's not like l'm going crazy.

19:28.028 --> 19:29.772
l know that.

19:36.998 --> 19:40.747
Okay, so we got five thirsty students
each wanting a soda,

19:40.920 --> 19:42.794
but they only have
1 1 coins between them.

19:42.964 --> 19:45.800
How many of them
will actually get a drink?

19:45.968 --> 19:47.510
None.

19:48.722 --> 19:50.300
Right, the damn machine's
broken again.

19:50.474 --> 19:53.891
They do this every semester
before midterms, just to psych us out.

19:54.063 --> 19:55.641
Save your money, Kel.

19:55.815 --> 19:58.104
l can't take this. l'm going home.

19:58.277 --> 20:00.104
Kelly, it's only sixth period.

20:00.279 --> 20:01.987
Everybody here is so serious.

20:02.198 --> 20:04.405
What's the matter, Kel?
ls the pressure getting to you?

20:04.618 --> 20:08.201
- l just need a good soak in the tub.
- Me too.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.826
Me three.

20:10.001 --> 20:12.041
What do you say
we make it a threesome?

20:12.254 --> 20:13.285
Yeah, right.

20:13.923 --> 20:15.916
Would you mind getting
a ride from someone else?

20:16.092 --> 20:17.551
Nat needs me for a couple of hours.

20:17.761 --> 20:19.884
That's terrible.
How can you go back to that place?

20:20.098 --> 20:21.177
lt's where l work.

20:21.391 --> 20:23.882
Yeah, but after last night...

20:24.061 --> 20:25.935
Donna, last night was last night.

20:26.147 --> 20:28.306
l mean, you shouldn't punish Nat
for being victimized

20:28.484 --> 20:30.192
by circumstances
beyond his control.

20:30.403 --> 20:31.862
He feels bad enough as it is.

20:32.072 --> 20:34.990
Hey, if Brenda can go back to
the scene of the crime, then you can.

20:35.869 --> 20:39.570
Okay, l'll go, if everyone else will.

20:39.749 --> 20:42.121
- l'm up for it.
- Me too.

20:42.294 --> 20:44.085
Actually, l have some things

20:44.255 --> 20:46.793
l was supposed to do
around the house today.

20:47.843 --> 20:50.417
Cool. l'll see you guys there.

20:51.890 --> 20:53.301
Bye.

20:59.150 --> 21:00.229
Brandon.

21:00.402 --> 21:02.525
Hey, need a ride to the Pit?
lt's where l'm going.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.024
No, Thursdays l go to Rapline.

21:04.198 --> 21:05.823
That's kind of what
l wanna talk about.

21:05.992 --> 21:09.362
Okay, l'm good for about ten seconds.
What's up?

21:09.539 --> 21:10.914
Do you think Brenda's doing okay?

21:11.124 --> 21:13.450
Yeah, as well as can be expected.
Why, you don't think so?

21:13.669 --> 21:15.543
Well, on the surface,
everything seems okay,

21:15.714 --> 21:17.623
but why doesn't
she wanna talk about it?

21:17.842 --> 21:21.259
Well, no offence, but maybe she just
doesn't wanna talk about it with you.

21:21.430 --> 21:24.052
Well, just as long as she talks
to somebody.

21:24.559 --> 21:25.934
Okay.

21:29.149 --> 21:31.640
- Hey, Bren.
- This is yours.

21:31.819 --> 21:34.607
Oh, yes. l vaguely remember
lending this shirt to somebody

21:34.781 --> 21:37.272
who promised to give it right back
about a year ago.

21:37.451 --> 21:40.322
- Better late than never.
- Thanks.

21:40.497 --> 21:43.783
You know, l expected to find you here
in midterm hell studying maniacally.

21:43.960 --> 21:46.630
Well, l started to, but l thought
l'd get my clothes for tomorrow.

21:46.797 --> 21:48.256
And when l couldn't find anything,

21:48.424 --> 21:52.588
l decided that organizing this mess
was a much more pressing task.

21:52.764 --> 21:56.299
Besides, l figure by now,
l either know it or l don't.

21:56.477 --> 21:58.766
You never cease to amaze me, sis.

21:58.939 --> 22:00.979
Why, because
l'm cleaning my closet?

22:01.150 --> 22:03.392
No, because
you're a very strong person.

22:03.570 --> 22:06.192
- Brandon.
- No, l'm serious.

22:06.365 --> 22:07.610
Everybody's really impressed

22:07.784 --> 22:10.026
with how you're handling
this whole robbery thing.

22:10.204 --> 22:13.621
Well, Andrea was a little worried.

22:13.959 --> 22:15.501
Why, what did Andrea say?

22:15.711 --> 22:18.381
She said being held up like that
is a real shock to your system.

22:18.548 --> 22:21.882
Most people aren't able to just let it
roll off their back the way you have.

22:22.053 --> 22:24.176
Yeah, well, l just put my mind to it.

22:24.348 --> 22:26.092
l mean, l don't wanna be
a burden to anyone

22:26.267 --> 22:28.639
and l certainly don't need
anyone's pity.

22:31.607 --> 22:32.770
Where's my Mr. Pony?

22:33.485 --> 22:36.486
Brandon,
you do not have a Mr. Pony.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.115
You had a Mr. Lion,

22:38.325 --> 22:41.410
and you lost him
and cried for three days straight.

22:41.579 --> 22:42.658
You do have a good memory.

22:42.831 --> 22:45.702
And if you ever tell anybody about that,
l will kill you.

22:45.877 --> 22:47.870
Okay. Good night, Brandon.

22:48.088 --> 22:49.499
Good night.

23:01.272 --> 23:03.810
Anytime now.

23:04.527 --> 23:06.983
You gonna be here
when l get back?

23:07.531 --> 23:09.239
Dylan, don't go, please.

23:09.408 --> 23:12.742
Don't run off
with any handsome strangers.

23:13.205 --> 23:15.162
Dylan, wait.

23:18.796 --> 23:20.705
Oh, my God.

23:21.883 --> 23:24.505
You scream, you die.

23:53.926 --> 23:55.753
She is really not herself
this morning.

23:55.971 --> 23:57.798
l don't understand
why you two didn't tell her

23:57.973 --> 24:00.180
- to finish up and get going.
- Dad, we did.

24:00.352 --> 24:03.188
Jim, be gentle.

24:06.193 --> 24:08.269
Sweetheart, it's getting late.

24:08.446 --> 24:11.116
Yeah, l know. l should've done this
ages ago like Mom said.

24:11.366 --> 24:13.655
But l kept putting it off,
and now l'm paying for it.

24:13.870 --> 24:15.495
Sweetheart, you got midterms.

24:15.706 --> 24:18.244
Dad, l know, but how can l go
if l have nothing to wear?

24:18.418 --> 24:20.826
l mean, look at this.

24:21.004 --> 24:23.626
l found it crumpled in the corner
under a pile of junk.

24:23.841 --> 24:26.083
lf l wore this to school,
people would laugh at me.

24:26.303 --> 24:28.629
What about this one?
This one's okay.

24:29.307 --> 24:31.929
Well, of course it is now
after l did all this work.

24:32.103 --> 24:33.514
l mean, l just can't let things go

24:33.730 --> 24:35.937
and expect for them to be
here for me when l need them.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.436
Mom, we're really gonna be late.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.104
Honey,
maybe we should call the school

24:39.279 --> 24:40.690
and we can reschedule your test.

24:40.906 --> 24:42.365
Mom, no. l don't need any favours.

24:42.533 --> 24:44.407
l mean,
l can pass this test blindfolded.

24:44.578 --> 24:47.200
Look, l just had some stuff
to take care of. l'll be right down.

25:03.395 --> 25:06.562
All right.
The first section is multiple-choice.

25:06.732 --> 25:09.188
Second section is short answer.

25:09.403 --> 25:11.610
Good luck, ladies and gentlemen.

25:19.833 --> 25:21.031
And go.

25:29.012 --> 25:33.805
You do what l tell you
and you won't get hurt, understand?

25:34.478 --> 25:36.056
No, l don't.

25:36.230 --> 25:38.804
l never did anything to you.
l was just trying to take my test.

25:39.568 --> 25:42.356
You scream, you die.

25:42.530 --> 25:43.810
Now open the register.

25:48.038 --> 25:49.236
Quit stalling!

25:49.456 --> 25:52.790
- Come on, woman. Time's up.
- No, go back!

25:58.218 --> 25:59.878
Bren, what's wrong?

26:00.054 --> 26:02.094
l'm sorry, l couldn't open it, Dylan.

26:02.265 --> 26:03.843
Open what? What?

26:04.059 --> 26:06.467
lt's okay. What?

26:10.693 --> 26:12.816
Bren, Bren. Hey, hey, hey. Bren.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.821
Brenda, what's wrong? What is it?

26:14.991 --> 26:16.271
l'm sorry, it's my fault.

26:16.451 --> 26:18.989
He killed you and Brandon
because l couldn't open the register.

26:19.205 --> 26:21.114
Wait, wait, we're not dead, huh?

26:21.291 --> 26:23.331
We're not. lt's okay, come on.

26:26.590 --> 26:28.298
lt's gonna be okay.

26:28.467 --> 26:29.842
l don't know what's going on.

26:30.011 --> 26:31.885
l don't know
what's happening anymore.

26:32.514 --> 26:34.922
lt's gonna be okay.

26:36.853 --> 26:40.899
lt's not, Dylan.
lt's not gonna be okay.

27:11.442 --> 27:13.150
Haven't seen that fellow
for a long time.

27:13.361 --> 27:16.316
l found him buried
under Brandon's collection

27:16.532 --> 27:18.157
of Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots.

27:18.326 --> 27:20.698
He lost an eye.

27:21.997 --> 27:23.954
Gives him character.

27:26.086 --> 27:28.245
Feel like coming downstairs
for supper?

27:28.423 --> 27:29.917
l'm not hungry.

27:35.808 --> 27:37.884
Your mom told me
what happened at school today.

27:40.522 --> 27:42.396
Guess you're real disappointed
in me, huh?

27:43.443 --> 27:46.065
No. Not at all.

27:49.117 --> 27:51.443
But we have to deal with this.

27:51.621 --> 27:53.863
The last thing l want you to do
is to go around

27:54.040 --> 27:56.247
pretending that things are okay
when they're not.

28:00.174 --> 28:02.926
You know,
l try not to think about it.

28:04.429 --> 28:06.505
l know l shouldn't.

28:08.393 --> 28:11.560
But l keep on playing it
over and over again in my head

28:11.731 --> 28:14.103
wondering what
l could have done differently.

28:17.071 --> 28:20.986
And l just feel so stupid
because l can't let it go.

28:22.120 --> 28:24.409
Honey, why didn't you
say something earlier?

28:26.042 --> 28:28.747
l'm so ashamed
for letting it get to me like this.

28:29.880 --> 28:34.590
Well, maybe it seems worse than it is
because you're fighting it so hard.

28:35.805 --> 28:37.347
l thought it would get better.

28:38.433 --> 28:40.342
l really did.

28:41.646 --> 28:44.398
l thought the memory would fade.

28:45.693 --> 28:49.394
But every little sound
just brings it back.

28:50.825 --> 28:53.151
And it just gets more gruesome
each time.

28:56.249 --> 28:58.456
You know, the other day,
your mother suggested

28:58.627 --> 29:02.210
we get you some counselling
to help you deal with what happened.

29:03.425 --> 29:06.177
And l guess l wanted to believe
that with all our love and support,

29:07.931 --> 29:11.016
that you'd just pick yourself up
and get on with things.

29:11.978 --> 29:14.350
And l wanted--
l mean, that's what l was trying to do.

29:14.524 --> 29:15.603
l know.

29:15.817 --> 29:19.483
But sometimes, even family
and friends aren't enough, Brenda.

29:22.409 --> 29:24.983
You want me to see a shrink, right?

29:29.085 --> 29:30.413
Right.

29:33.549 --> 29:35.376
l knew if l told you guys
what was going on,

29:35.552 --> 29:36.583
that's what you would say.

29:38.013 --> 29:40.302
Honey, it's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

29:41.059 --> 29:42.719
l just don't understand
how some doctor

29:42.895 --> 29:44.722
can talk me
out of having nightmares.

29:46.483 --> 29:48.025
Well...

29:48.569 --> 29:51.274
l took the liberty of making
an appointment for tomorrow.

29:51.949 --> 29:53.277
Oh, my God.

29:53.451 --> 29:56.737
Brenda,
we don't wanna pressure you on this.

29:57.957 --> 30:00.365
Why don't you sleep on it tonight?

30:00.544 --> 30:04.127
And if you feel better about things
tomorrow, we can always cancel.

30:08.513 --> 30:10.173
Your dad got home
about two minutes ago,

30:10.348 --> 30:12.257
and he and your mom
are upstairs talking to her.

30:12.476 --> 30:14.884
- You think l should come home too?
- Don't worry.

30:15.105 --> 30:17.643
This point, l think she's
more embarrassed than anything else.

30:17.859 --> 30:19.353
- Are you sure?
- Look,

30:19.569 --> 30:22.820
if you're getting bad vibes being there,
that's another story.

30:22.990 --> 30:24.401
l'm sure Nat would let you off.

30:24.618 --> 30:26.029
Hey, believe me, l thought about it

30:26.203 --> 30:28.410
but l figured if l didn't come back
to work right away,

30:28.581 --> 30:29.612
l may never be able to.

30:30.167 --> 30:32.207
You'd get right back
on that horse, huh?

30:32.420 --> 30:35.291
Yeah,
l guess it's a Walsh family tradition.

30:37.468 --> 30:41.003
Hey, man, remember you said
you heard something that night?

30:41.223 --> 30:44.842
Don't get me started.
l mean, like, if we'd only gone inside.

30:45.020 --> 30:47.013
lf we'd only locked the door,
only stayed home...

30:47.190 --> 30:49.183
That's the drill.
You feel that way too, huh?

30:49.401 --> 30:51.690
Yeah, and if it's that way for us...

30:52.405 --> 30:56.404
Yeah, l know, man. l know.

31:00.207 --> 31:02.366
And then l started having
the nightmares.

31:02.961 --> 31:06.960
And it just kept on replaying itself
over and over again in my head.

31:08.844 --> 31:12.214
l was trying to do anything to stop
from thinking that l was going crazy.

31:12.891 --> 31:14.385
Stupid things.

31:14.560 --> 31:19.556
Organizing my closet,
washing my hair a hundred times.

31:20.401 --> 31:23.023
Making sure l looked great
on the outside

31:23.196 --> 31:25.438
even though l was falling apart
on the inside.

31:26.033 --> 31:29.568
That must have been
a tremendously difficult act to keep up.

31:29.747 --> 31:31.241
Well, not at first.

31:32.042 --> 31:34.913
But it just kept on building
and building...

31:35.504 --> 31:39.289
l was taking this midterm
and l realized that l was losing it.

31:39.969 --> 31:41.297
And it really scared me.

31:41.471 --> 31:43.380
You're not losing it, Brenda.

31:43.599 --> 31:46.055
You're having
a perfectly normal reaction

31:46.227 --> 31:48.932
to an extraordinary experience.

31:49.106 --> 31:54.018
There's even a name for it:
post-traumatic stress disorder.

31:54.196 --> 31:55.524
So, what do l do about it?

31:55.698 --> 31:58.450
The first step is to acknowledge
that you have a problem.

31:58.661 --> 32:00.120
By coming here and seeing me,

32:00.288 --> 32:02.958
you've taken a big step towards
healing what's happened to you.

32:03.542 --> 32:06.247
The next thing
you want to do is talk about it.

32:06.421 --> 32:10.254
Get your fears and anxieties
out in the open like we're doing now.

32:10.468 --> 32:12.461
lt's nothing we're gonna solve
in an hour.

32:12.679 --> 32:15.349
But we will get through it eventually.

32:15.517 --> 32:18.222
So in the meantime,
what do l do about the nightmares?

32:18.395 --> 32:21.930
Brenda, l want you to think back
and give me a memory

32:22.150 --> 32:25.602
of the most happy secure time
you can imagine.

32:29.911 --> 32:33.281
That would have to be
when l was with my horse.

32:33.457 --> 32:35.699
His name was Sylvester.

32:36.044 --> 32:38.832
And for a while, my dad used
to take me to ride him every Sunday.

32:39.924 --> 32:43.294
He was the gentlest horse
in the world.

32:43.512 --> 32:46.086
l used to love to bury my face
in his soft mane

32:46.308 --> 32:49.013
and hold on tight
while he'd take me around the ring.

32:49.854 --> 32:56.357
l've never felt happier or safer
than when l was riding Sylvester.

32:56.530 --> 33:00.481
Brenda, whenever you start
to feel anxious,

33:00.661 --> 33:05.158
l want you to picture yourself
in that ring riding Sylvester.

33:05.333 --> 33:07.955
We'll call that your safe place.

33:08.171 --> 33:09.796
Can you see it now?

33:10.006 --> 33:11.833
Oh, yeah.

33:15.389 --> 33:17.180
- He's there.
- Where?

33:17.391 --> 33:19.099
He's on my horse.
He's in my safe place.

33:19.269 --> 33:20.977
l can't get him out of my head.

33:21.146 --> 33:26.058
We will. We will work very hard
and we will do just that.

33:37.335 --> 33:40.206
Where are they? Whatever happened
to ''50 minutes, time's up''?

33:40.381 --> 33:43.217
lf they don't get here soon,
you guys are gonna look conspicuous

33:43.385 --> 33:44.630
because l gotta go to work.

33:44.803 --> 33:47.175
We gotta do something
so we don't look so obvious.

33:47.348 --> 33:49.092
We could play a game.

33:49.267 --> 33:51.805
- How about Twister?
- Twister?

33:52.021 --> 33:55.272
Hi, Brenda. Yeah, we all just decided
to spend Saturday afternoon here

33:55.442 --> 33:57.814
in a friendly game of Twister...yeah.

33:58.029 --> 34:00.022
What? l like Twister.

34:00.199 --> 34:03.154
And l'm nervous
and l can't think of anything else.

34:03.370 --> 34:06.206
Andrea, can you tear yourself
away from that book for just a minute

34:06.374 --> 34:07.619
and participate here?

34:08.126 --> 34:10.034
Look,
why don't we just tell her the truth?

34:10.212 --> 34:12.538
That we were worried
and wanted to be here to support her

34:12.716 --> 34:14.257
when she came back
from the therapist.

34:14.760 --> 34:16.254
Oh, my God.
Let's do something.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.713
- A game, a game.
- Let's play a game.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.094
l thought we ruled out games.

34:20.266 --> 34:23.268
- Okay, guys, guys.
- Oh, good. Scrabble's a great idea.

34:23.438 --> 34:25.478
Here. l'll do the F.

34:25.650 --> 34:27.976
- All right, here, here.
- Oh, that rule.

34:28.152 --> 34:29.731
- l will.
- Where's the S?

34:29.947 --> 34:32.735
Yeah, l got the S right here.
l'm putting it together.

34:35.788 --> 34:38.706
- Okay, okay.
- Here.

34:38.876 --> 34:40.251
What are you all doing here?

34:42.214 --> 34:44.884
- What? We're playing Scrabble.
- Yeah.

34:45.092 --> 34:47.630
- Double word score, triple letter score.
- Good, Andrea.

34:47.846 --> 34:49.672
- Oh, very good.
- Very smart.

34:49.849 --> 34:51.474
Good.

34:52.393 --> 34:54.850
Those are not real words.

34:55.940 --> 34:58.776
Well, yeah,
we're playing under special rules, see.

34:58.944 --> 35:00.486
Every word you make,
you lose a point.

35:00.655 --> 35:04.784
lt's...Reverse Scrabble.

35:04.994 --> 35:06.025
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:06.204 --> 35:07.782
lt's kind of fun, you should try it.

35:07.998 --> 35:10.287
''Reverse Scrabble''? Nice try.

35:12.129 --> 35:14.336
Brandon told us where you were at
and we were worried,

35:14.507 --> 35:16.132
and we wanted
to come see how you were.

35:16.593 --> 35:17.624
Brandon.

35:18.137 --> 35:20.545
Hey, everybody was calling all day,
you know?

35:20.724 --> 35:22.183
l let it slip out, l'm sorry.

35:26.773 --> 35:30.474
Well, l'm feeling a little bit better.

35:30.654 --> 35:32.943
l mean, l didn't wanna
go at all at first.

35:33.115 --> 35:35.867
lt's weird going to a shrink.
lt's not as if l'm crazy.

35:37.162 --> 35:39.784
Well, l went to see a shrink once
after my parents broke up.

35:39.958 --> 35:42.284
My dad made me,
but it was no big deal.

35:42.461 --> 35:43.576
Yeah, same here.

35:43.796 --> 35:46.085
lt was during what my mom called
my troubled years.

35:46.258 --> 35:47.373
lt was before l knew you.

35:47.927 --> 35:50.003
Yeah, l used to bug my mom
to take me to see one.

35:50.180 --> 35:53.051
But she said l had to come up
with a good problem first.

35:53.810 --> 35:55.518
How about you, Steve?

35:55.687 --> 35:57.644
Yeah, well, okay. Once or twice.

35:57.815 --> 35:59.475
But l didn't lie on a couch
or anything.

35:59.651 --> 36:02.225
- Yeah, neither did l.
- l would.

36:02.446 --> 36:05.234
l mean, it's more relaxing that way,
easier to talk.

36:05.450 --> 36:06.565
You've been too?

36:08.413 --> 36:10.739
Well, no, but l've read a lot about it.

36:10.916 --> 36:12.410
She's gonna be the psychiatrist.

36:13.336 --> 36:15.744
Well, l've thought about it.

36:15.964 --> 36:17.708
Anyway, how did it go?

36:18.593 --> 36:20.502
Well, we didn't clear
everything up in an hour,

36:20.679 --> 36:23.597
but it was nice to hear someone give
me a reason for what l was feeling.

36:23.767 --> 36:26.305
lt just made me feel
a little bit less confused.

36:28.147 --> 36:31.433
Hello? Yes.

36:31.610 --> 36:34.184
So anyway, l think l'm ready
to put it all behind me.

36:34.781 --> 36:36.572
l mean, it was really horrible.

36:36.742 --> 36:39.697
More than l was willing
to admit to myself.

36:39.872 --> 36:43.491
But l think l'm ready to start
dealing with it and get on with my life.

36:43.668 --> 36:44.948
- Attagirl.
- All right.

36:45.170 --> 36:47.744
Just a minute.
Brenda, it's the police.

36:47.924 --> 36:49.466
They've picked up a suspect

36:49.635 --> 36:52.043
and they want you to come down
and look at a lineup today.

36:52.263 --> 36:55.549
Bren, that's great. l mean,
that's your chance to nail this guy.

36:56.519 --> 36:57.634
l can't go.

36:58.230 --> 36:59.641
Brenda, you gotta do this.

36:59.857 --> 37:03.440
Brandon, no, l don't have to.
And l'm sorry, l can't.

37:19.967 --> 37:21.841
Brenda, l know how you feel.

37:22.053 --> 37:23.713
But if you at least
don't go down there--

37:23.889 --> 37:25.763
You can't let this guy
get away with this.

37:25.975 --> 37:28.015
You're not the ones
who went through what l did.

37:28.186 --> 37:29.514
lt's just not that easy.

37:29.730 --> 37:31.937
Now listen,
he's gonna be behind a screen.

37:32.108 --> 37:33.388
He won't be able to hurt you.

37:33.610 --> 37:37.110
Dad, don't you get it?
l never wanna see him again.

37:37.324 --> 37:40.325
So you'd rather give him the chance
to go do this to someone else?

37:40.536 --> 37:42.493
- No.
- Because that's what's gonna happen.

37:42.706 --> 37:43.821
l don't understand you.

37:44.041 --> 37:45.619
Dylan, you weren't there.

37:45.835 --> 37:47.329
You didn't have a gun
pointing at you.

37:47.504 --> 37:48.749
You weren't lying on the ground

37:48.923 --> 37:50.797
wondering if your head
was gonna get blown off.

37:55.223 --> 37:56.421
Sweetheart, it's okay.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.260
You don't have to go
if you don't want to.

37:58.435 --> 38:01.306
Mom, l want to go.
lt's just that l'm scared.

38:01.523 --> 38:02.638
Calm down, Bren.

38:02.858 --> 38:06.524
Dylan, l don't wanna calm down.
l mean, can't l even get angry?

38:07.281 --> 38:08.479
You and Brandon.

38:08.699 --> 38:10.739
You guys tell me
you'll never leave me alone again,

38:10.910 --> 38:12.570
then you put me
on a pedestal or something

38:12.746 --> 38:15.582
telling me how strong l am,
how great l am, how brave l am.

38:15.750 --> 38:17.992
Well, l am not. l am scared to death.

38:19.547 --> 38:22.418
And l'm sorry l'm yelling
but it's just how l feel, okay?

38:23.761 --> 38:26.133
- Okay.
- Absolutely okay.

38:35.610 --> 38:37.769
Okay. Let's go.

38:49.421 --> 38:52.257
Thanks for coming down today,
Brenda.

38:52.425 --> 38:55.296
- So, what do l have to do?
- Well, it's called a lineup.

38:55.470 --> 38:57.344
You'll see a bunch of guys
standing there.

38:57.515 --> 39:00.433
All you have to do is tell us if you
recognise the one who robbed you.

39:01.562 --> 39:03.353
All l have to do. Yeah, right.

39:03.523 --> 39:04.602
Don't worry.

39:04.816 --> 39:06.773
You'll be able to see him
but he won't see you.

39:08.112 --> 39:09.606
How are you sure?

39:09.823 --> 39:12.149
We do this all the time.

39:13.578 --> 39:14.823
You'll be okay.

39:15.330 --> 39:16.445
Come on. Let's do this.

39:16.624 --> 39:18.913
- Good luck, honey.
- Bye.

39:24.092 --> 39:26.418
We're gonna show you
a group of men behind that glass.

39:26.929 --> 39:28.673
This group may or may not contain

39:28.890 --> 39:31.097
the suspect who committed
the crime being investigated.

39:31.268 --> 39:33.557
Keep in mind that hairstyles,
beards and moustaches

39:33.730 --> 39:35.272
may be easily changed.

39:35.441 --> 39:36.983
When you have looked
at all of the men,

39:37.193 --> 39:39.863
tell me whether or not you see
the person who committed the crime.

39:40.030 --> 39:41.310
Do not tell any other witnesses

39:41.490 --> 39:43.483
that you have
or have not identified anyone.

39:44.411 --> 39:46.119
l don't even remember
what he looks like.

39:46.289 --> 39:47.997
l mean, l didn't really even see him.

39:48.166 --> 39:51.749
Well, just look carefully.
Clear your mind.

39:51.921 --> 39:53.878
Remember what you can.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.885
All l remember
is a monster with a gun.

40:01.601 --> 40:04.092
Okay, bring them in.

40:23.589 --> 40:26.425
Number 1 , move to the red square
at centre stage.

40:29.847 --> 40:31.923
Put your hat on.

40:33.352 --> 40:35.143
Look left.

40:36.398 --> 40:38.474
Face to the right.

40:40.069 --> 40:41.978
Face forward.

40:50.917 --> 40:54.963
Bachelor Number 2,
move to the red square.

40:56.007 --> 40:58.000
Put your hat on.

41:05.019 --> 41:07.890
Number 4,
move to the red square.

41:35.435 --> 41:38.223
Damn it! Do you understand me?
Do you?

41:42.778 --> 41:45.779
You scream, you die.

41:52.375 --> 41:54.415
That's him. That's the one.

41:54.586 --> 41:56.828
- You sure?
- Yes, l'm sure.

41:57.006 --> 41:59.794
That's him, that's the guy
who held a gun to my head.

42:00.969 --> 42:02.547
l want you to put him away.

42:11.734 --> 42:13.643
Are you okay?

42:13.820 --> 42:15.362
Thank you, Brenda.

42:15.531 --> 42:17.773
You have a very brave
young daughter.

42:17.951 --> 42:20.323
- Thank you.
- Can we go now?

42:20.496 --> 42:23.284
Certainly.
lf we need you, we'll call you.

42:26.045 --> 42:27.504
- lnspector.
- Yes?

42:29.049 --> 42:31.719
- Who is he?
- What?

42:31.886 --> 42:33.926
The guy who held me up,
what's his name?

42:34.139 --> 42:37.390
You don't need to know his name.
He's just a strung-out 1 7-year-old.

42:38.562 --> 42:40.721
He's only 1 7?

42:41.691 --> 42:43.731
That's my age.

42:45.112 --> 42:46.772
Thanks.

42:56.711 --> 42:58.371
l don't know if l can do this.

42:58.547 --> 43:02.415
Hey, come on.
Can't stay away forever.

43:10.146 --> 43:11.937
Are you okay?

43:12.107 --> 43:13.898
Yeah, l guess l am.

43:14.109 --> 43:15.900
Brenda, get over here.

43:16.112 --> 43:17.487
Hi, Nat.

43:17.656 --> 43:18.901
Come here.

43:19.116 --> 43:21.821
l heard you did good downtown,
real good.

43:22.037 --> 43:24.409
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

43:25.917 --> 43:28.539
Bren. Donna, scoot over.

43:30.840 --> 43:34.174
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, l am.

43:34.387 --> 43:37.507
l thought coming back to this place
would be really scary, but it's not.

43:38.559 --> 43:40.137
lt's wonderful.
l'm glad to be back.

43:40.353 --> 43:41.468
We're glad too.

43:41.688 --> 43:43.515
All right,
who ordered the banana split?

43:43.691 --> 43:46.063
Oh, me. The one who's
finally going to pass Algebra.

43:46.236 --> 43:49.107
Yeah, well, Donna,
third time's the charm.

43:49.282 --> 43:50.824
Second. Second time.

43:51.034 --> 43:54.071
Oh, God, midterms.
l totally forgot that l have to take them.

43:54.288 --> 43:57.289
Don't worry, exams are a piece of cake
compared to what you went through.

43:57.459 --> 43:58.490
Oh, let's see.

43:58.669 --> 44:02.204
Being held up at gunpoint
or failing English.

44:02.382 --> 44:04.126
l don't know,
it's kind of a toss-up for me.

44:07.681 --> 44:10.137
What? What did l say?

44:10.310 --> 44:12.766
- You can be such a jerk sometimes.
- All right, all right.

44:12.938 --> 44:15.608
But if you were failing English,
you wouldn't be laughing either.

44:15.775 --> 44:17.317
No?

44:25.872 --> 44:27.663
Bren, you asleep?

44:28.292 --> 44:30.201
No, not yet.

44:32.089 --> 44:34.296
lt was good to see you
back at the Peach Pit tonight.

44:34.467 --> 44:36.211
l know it took a lot of courage.

44:36.386 --> 44:39.174
Brandon, please, l've had
quite enough praise for a while.

44:39.349 --> 44:41.306
All right, you're a huge loser,
how's that?

44:41.477 --> 44:43.434
Much better.

44:44.272 --> 44:45.351
So how you doing?

44:46.609 --> 44:48.068
Tired.

44:48.236 --> 44:50.443
lt's been a long time
since l had a good night's sleep,

44:50.614 --> 44:52.856
but l think l'm finally
gonna get one tonight.

44:53.326 --> 44:55.117
Sweet dreams.

44:56.831 --> 44:58.491
Brandon?

45:01.170 --> 45:02.795
Could you hand me Mr. Pony?

45:10.724 --> 45:13.512
Good night. Good night, Mr. Pony.

45:14.312 --> 45:16.139
Night, Brandon.
