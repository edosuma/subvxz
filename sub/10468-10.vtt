09:48.245 --> 09:51.117
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
HAVE A LITTLE CHAT?

09:59.082 --> 10:02.128
SO ARE YOU SEEING
SOMEONE ELSE?

10:02.128 --> 10:03.913
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

10:03.913 --> 10:04.957
NO.

10:04.957 --> 10:08.046
NO, NOT--
NOT RIGHT NOW, NO.

10:08.796 --> 10:10.291
NO.

10:11.050 --> 10:16.263
DO YOU WANT ME TO WANT YOU
TO...NOT SEE ANYONE ELSE?

10:17.496 --> 10:19.276
BECAUSE I THINK
THAT I WANT YOU TO WANT ME

10:19.276 --> 10:20.799
TO NOT SEE
ANYONE ELSE.

10:22.627 --> 10:24.890
HMM. THAT'S...

10:24.890 --> 10:27.632
THAT'S A-- THAT'S A--
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

10:29.765 --> 10:32.960
A--A NECESSARY
QUESTION...

10:32.980 --> 10:36.119
AT SOME POINT
FOR US TO ANSWER.

10:38.251 --> 10:41.777
GOD, COULD THEY
CRANK THE HEAT ANY MORE IN THIS PLACE?

10:41.777 --> 10:44.997
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?
UH, ABOUT THE CARD?

10:46.520 --> 10:49.393
I SAY YEAH.
I SAY YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

10:49.393 --> 10:51.656
LET'S--WE'LL SIGN
IT AS A COUPLE.

10:51.656 --> 10:53.136
WHY NOT?

10:58.576 --> 11:02.232
THIS ONE, UH... I KNOW THE
PROPORTIONS AREN'T RIGHT YET,

11:02.232 --> 11:04.234
BUT YOU COULD ALSO
SAVE SOME MONEY

11:04.234 --> 11:05.553
BY GETTING RID OF
THIS CROSS-HATCHING.

11:05.723 --> 11:08.151
THESE ARE VERY PRETTY.
THEY'RE NICE.

11:08.151 --> 11:11.280
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU COULD ACTUALLY DO THIS.

11:11.290 --> 11:13.885
YEAH, WELL, I HAD MY OWN FURNITURE
BUSINESS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

11:13.911 --> 11:18.596
I CAN SEE THAT. NOW THESE ARE CHAIRS
YOU COULD ACTUALLY BUILD.

11:18.727 --> 11:21.686
WELL, LOOK, I SHOWED THESE
TO A COUPLE OF GUYS I KNOW

11:21.686 --> 11:25.575
IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS,
AND TWO OF THEM SAID THEY MIGHT BUY SOME

11:25.585 --> 11:26.867
IF THEY COULD
JUST SEE A PROTOTYPE.

11:26.967 --> 11:29.735
YOU'LL SELL A LOT OF THESE, CHARLIE.
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

11:29.785 --> 11:30.920
YOU THINK?

11:30.950 --> 11:34.136
OH, YEAH. YOU JUST NEED THE RIGHT
PERSON TO MAKE 'EM FOR YA.

11:34.146 --> 11:37.441
YEAH. WELL,
THAT'S, UH, THAT'S WHY I...

11:37.441 --> 11:39.269
HEH.

11:39.269 --> 11:40.792
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

11:40.792 --> 11:44.100
[LAUGHS] OH, CHARLIE.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.231
WHAT?
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

11:45.231 --> 11:46.885
NOTHING.
IT'S JUST...

11:46.885 --> 11:49.975
YOU REMIND ME OF ME 30 YEARS AGO.
I CAME TO MY BOSS.

11:49.975 --> 11:53.152
I PITCHED HIM THIS
LINE OF HIGH-QUALITY KNOCKOFFS.

11:53.152 --> 11:55.024
SOME OF 'EM WE'RE STILL
MAKING RIGHT NOW.

11:55.024 --> 11:56.678
THAT'S HOW I GOT STARTED
IN THE BUSINESS,

11:56.688 --> 11:59.155
GETTING TOLD NO
BY A GUY JUST LIKE ME.

11:59.185 --> 12:01.365
WELL, HE WAS WRONG THEN,
WASN'T HE?

12:01.385 --> 12:03.143
YEAH, HE WAS WRONG.

12:04.163 --> 12:07.776
SO, THE...
RIGHT ANSWER IS YES, ISN'T IT?

12:07.776 --> 12:11.301
[SIGHS]
CHARLIE, I CAN'T AFFORD

12:11.301 --> 12:14.434
TO START A NEW
PRODUCT LINE JUST NOW.

12:14.434 --> 12:17.829
I CAN BARELY AFFORD TO
MAKE PAYROLL THIS MONTH.

12:17.829 --> 12:20.049
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU--

12:20.049 --> 12:22.304
I DON'T LIKE
TO ADVERTISE THIS,

12:22.324 --> 12:24.444
BUT YOU'RE MANAGEMENT NOW.
YOU MAY AS WELL KNOW.

12:24.444 --> 12:28.563
WE LIVE...
ORDER TO ORDER RIGHT NOW.

12:28.843 --> 12:31.408
WE COULD GO UNDER
JUST ABOUT ANY TIME.

12:33.366 --> 12:35.891
YOUR FURNITURE'S
BEAUTIFUL, CHARLIE.

12:35.891 --> 12:39.155
I JUST WISH THERE WAS ANYTHING
I COULD DO ABOUT IT.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.814
CONGRATULATIONS.

12:45.814 --> 12:48.616
HERE HE IS--
HOLLY'S RESTAURATEUR!

12:48.676 --> 12:51.808
WHAT A LIFE STORY YOU HAVE.
YOU'RE A REAL SURVIVOR.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.667
GOD, I'M SORRY I DITCHED YOU.
WE HAVE A BIT OF A WEDDING CAKE CRISIS.

12:54.709 --> 12:58.195
THEY DELIVERED ONE WITH AN ALMOND PASTE,
AND THE GROOM HAS A NUT ALLERGY RASH.

12:58.220 --> 13:01.177
THERE SHE IS. COME WITH ME. JANE!
JANE IS A CHEF.

13:01.177 --> 13:03.049
AUNT LYDIA, I NEED
TO STEAL JANE AWAY FROM YOU.

13:03.059 --> 13:05.235
THIS IS BAILEY SALINGER.
HE'LL TAKE OVER.

13:05.275 --> 13:07.531
THE BOY YOUR MOTHER
TOLD ME ABOUT?

13:07.531 --> 13:09.185
YES. PROBABLY.

13:09.185 --> 13:11.274
SHE FORGOT HER CANE.
DO YOU MIND?

13:11.274 --> 13:12.884
UH, NO.
NOT AT ALL.

13:12.884 --> 13:15.844
THANKS.
YOU HAVE 2 HOURS TO BAKE A CAKE.

13:15.844 --> 13:20.100
BRADFORD,
THIS IS BARRY SALINDER,

13:20.120 --> 13:21.485
HOLLY'S BOYFRIEND.

13:21.505 --> 13:24.395
IT'S BAILEY SALINGER. IT'S NICE TO MEET
YOU. CONGRATULATIONS.

13:24.425 --> 13:27.029
THIS IS
BARRY SALINGER,

13:27.029 --> 13:28.805
HOLLY'S FIANC .

13:28.835 --> 13:31.331
IT'S BAILEY,
AND WE'RE NOT ENGAGED YET.

13:31.381 --> 13:32.424
WE'RE NOT EVEN
CLOSE, REALLY.

13:32.464 --> 13:34.427
I THINK MAYBE AUNT LYDIA
HAD A MISTAKEN--

13:34.427 --> 13:38.450
THIS IS BAILEY SALINGER,
HOLLY'S HUSBAND.

13:38.910 --> 13:40.956
DID I GET IT RIGHT?

13:40.956 --> 13:42.784
CLOSE ENOUGH.

13:45.942 --> 13:48.974
GRIFFIN, NO MORE. I CAN'T TAKE IT.
WE'VE BEEN TO 11 PSYCHICS ALREADY.

13:49.009 --> 13:50.269
WE'RE NOT
GONNA FIND HER.

13:50.269 --> 13:52.445
COME ON,
JUST 2 SECONDS, OK?

13:54.317 --> 13:55.579
MADAME OLGA?

13:55.579 --> 13:59.017
NO, I'M TRUDY.
OLGA'S INSIDE.

14:05.850 --> 14:10.159
LET ME GUESS,
YOU'RE A SKEPTIC.

14:10.159 --> 14:11.638
YOU READ MY MIND.

14:11.638 --> 14:13.727
YEAH, WELL, ME, TOO.

14:13.727 --> 14:15.686
HOW'S THAT?
YOU WORK HERE.

14:15.686 --> 14:18.036
OLGA SAYS I HAVE THE GIFT,
BUT I'M NOT SURE.

14:18.076 --> 14:19.690
'CAUSE SHE'S
JUST ONE PERSON.

14:19.690 --> 14:21.692
I HAVEN'T READ
FOR THAT MANY PEOPLE,

14:21.692 --> 14:24.545
SO MY WORK KINDA
HASN'T BEEN TESTED, YOU KNOW?

14:24.585 --> 14:26.088
OH.

14:27.698 --> 14:30.135
WHY DON'T YOU
PRACTICE ON ME?

14:30.135 --> 14:31.441
REALLY?

14:31.441 --> 14:32.834
SURE.

14:38.100 --> 14:42.756
OK. THINK OF A QUESTION
YOU WANT ANSWERED.

14:42.756 --> 14:45.020
I HAVE ONE.

14:45.020 --> 14:47.892
LET'S SEE...

14:49.459 --> 14:51.765
IT'S ABOUT A MAN.

14:54.507 --> 14:56.596
BIG MONEY PROBLEM?

14:58.511 --> 15:01.036
THERE'S A GIFT
YOU'D LIKE TO RECEIVE.

15:02.602 --> 15:05.344
WAIT A MINUTE--
OH, THESE ARE UPSIDE DOWN.

15:08.565 --> 15:11.263
IT'S ABOUT YOUR WORK.

15:11.263 --> 15:13.004
UH-HUH.

15:14.164 --> 15:16.899
YOU'VE MADE GREAT EFFORTS,
AND NOW YOU'RE WAITING TO SEE

15:16.965 --> 15:18.618
IF THEY'LL
BE RECOGNIZED.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.168
WOW, THAT'S UM...YEAH.

15:21.248 --> 15:22.796
REALLY,
I GOT THAT RIGHT?

15:22.796 --> 15:24.292
YEAH. UH...

15:24.302 --> 15:27.192
SO CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

15:31.196 --> 15:35.287
THE HERMIT. THAT'S
A HARD ONE TO READ.

15:35.287 --> 15:36.745
ARE YOU A WRITER?

15:37.563 --> 15:41.815
IT MEANS THAT
YOU'LL FIND THE ANSWERS YOU SEEK

15:41.815 --> 15:44.383
BY YOURSELF,
LOOKING INWARD.

15:44.383 --> 15:45.907
BY MYSELF?

15:45.907 --> 15:48.474
OR IN A GATHERING
OF OTHERS LOOKING OUTWARD.

15:48.474 --> 15:49.606
ONE OF THOSE.

15:49.606 --> 15:51.564
THOSE ARE
2 COMPLETE OPPOSITES.

15:51.564 --> 15:52.696
CAN YOU PICK ONE?

15:52.696 --> 15:54.702
LET'S SEE.

15:54.712 --> 15:57.602
UH, I'M GONNA SAY--

15:57.642 --> 15:58.789
HEY, I FOUND HER.

15:58.789 --> 16:00.356
SHE'S GONNA BE
AT A NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY TONIGHT.

16:00.356 --> 16:02.954
I GOT THE ADDRESS RIGHT HERE.
GATHERING. DEFINITELY GATHERING.

16:02.967 --> 16:04.207
COME ON, JULES.

16:04.247 --> 16:06.896
IT WAS. I WAS TOTALLY
GONNA SAY GATHERING.

16:06.906 --> 16:09.365
- THANKS.
- I WAS GON--I WAS.

16:09.365 --> 16:10.583
[BEEP]

16:11.845 --> 16:13.116
OWEN, LET'S GO.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.980
THE POST OFFICE
CLOSES IN HALF AN HOUR.

16:15.980 --> 16:19.505
OK, ARE WE READY, DIANA?
LET'S DOUBLE-CHECK.

16:22.291 --> 16:24.538
THURBER WON'T COME.
HE'S BEING STUBBORN.

16:24.578 --> 16:27.339
SO GRAB HIM
BY THE COLLAR AND TUG HIM A LITTLE.

16:27.339 --> 16:32.083
OK, THE HISTORY,
GEOMETRY, ENGLISH. GOOD TO GO.

16:33.737 --> 16:34.738
CLAUDIA?

16:34.738 --> 16:36.218
WHAT?

16:36.218 --> 16:37.828
I THINK THURBER'S SICK.

16:37.828 --> 16:39.395
HE JUST THREW UP.

16:41.353 --> 16:42.621
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

16:56.978 --> 16:59.937
BUT THE WAY YOU
EXPLAINED IT TO ME, HE HAS NO CHOICE.

16:59.937 --> 17:01.547
EITHER HE STARTS
SELLING NEW THINGS,

17:01.547 --> 17:02.853
OR HE GOES
OUT OF BUSINESS.

17:02.853 --> 17:04.463
THAT'S THE WAY
I SEE IT.

17:04.463 --> 17:05.464
HE SEES IT
DIFFERENTLY.

17:05.464 --> 17:07.752
UM, GUYS?
WELL, HOW ELSE COULD HE SEE IT?

17:07.771 --> 17:09.678
WELL, HE THINKS
HIS WAY IS SAFE

17:09.708 --> 17:10.730
AND MY WAY
IS RISKIER.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.167
I DON'T MEAN
TO BE RUDE, BUT I--

17:12.167 --> 17:13.516
HOW IS HIS WAY SAFE?

17:13.516 --> 17:15.953
HIS WAY,
HE'S DEFINITELY GONNA FAIL.

17:15.953 --> 17:18.173
BUT YOUR WAY,
MAYBE HE WON'T.

17:18.173 --> 17:19.826
KIRSTEN, WHY ARE
YOU SO WORKED UP ABOUT ALL THIS?

17:19.826 --> 17:21.480
BECAUSE.

17:21.480 --> 17:24.752
BECAUSE WE GAVE UP
ON TRYING TO HAVE A BABY RIGHT NOW

17:24.791 --> 17:26.165
TO MAKE ROOM FOR THIS.

17:26.195 --> 17:28.111
YOU KNOW, FOR STUFF THAT'S
REALLY IMPORTANT TO US,

17:28.151 --> 17:29.358
AND YOU ARE SO CLOSE.

17:29.358 --> 17:32.100
IF THIS GUY,
IF YOU MADE HIM SEE REASON--

17:32.100 --> 17:33.318
IS THERE ANY WAY
THAT MAYBE YOU GUYS

17:33.318 --> 17:34.667
COULD JUST,
YOU KNOW, HOLD OFF?

17:34.667 --> 17:35.973
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, CHARLIE.
YOU KNOW--

17:35.973 --> 17:38.497
COULD YOU SAVE IT,
PLEASE?!

17:40.811 --> 17:42.926
I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS SO RUDE.

17:42.966 --> 17:44.676
I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST-- YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:44.706 --> 17:45.736
LUKE IS
MY BRAND-NEW BOYFRIEND.

17:45.746 --> 17:48.477
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
HAVING FUN HERE, OK?

17:48.597 --> 17:51.200
AND IT WAS SO, SO NICE
OF YOU TO SQUEEZE US IN

17:51.220 --> 17:54.085
BEFORE THE--
YOUR COMPANY PARTY THING, CHARLIE.

17:54.125 --> 17:56.076
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS NOT

17:56.116 --> 17:58.571
MY FANTASY NEW YEAR'S EVE
CONVERSATION HERE.

17:58.631 --> 18:01.530
I MEAN, THE FACTORY
GOING UNDER? COME ON.

18:01.550 --> 18:02.631
NO MORE SHOP TALK.

18:02.701 --> 18:05.793
-PROMISE.
-WE'RE SORRY.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.751
OH, MY GOD,
I HOPE YOU LIKE HIM.

18:07.751 --> 18:09.231
- WE WILL.
- WE WILL.

18:09.231 --> 18:11.700
DO YOU KNOW HE GREW UP
2 TOWNS FROM ME IN TEXAS?

18:11.730 --> 18:13.496
- SO EVERY TIME I HEAR HIM SAY--
- HOWDY.

18:14.307 --> 18:15.858
HE'S HERE.

18:17.285 --> 18:20.860
OK. LUKE, MEET, UH--
THIS IS CHARLIE.

18:20.890 --> 18:22.145
SIR.UH, IT'S CHARLIE.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.671
- THIS IS KIRSTEN.
- MA'AM. SORRY I'M LATE.

18:24.721 --> 18:26.255
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT LATE.
WE WERE EARLY, AND--

18:26.265 --> 18:28.293
SWEETHEART.

18:34.717 --> 18:36.393
HEY THERE, DARLING.

18:39.304 --> 18:42.220
OH, I MISSED YOU.
Luke: I MISSED YOU.

18:42.652 --> 18:44.327
THAT REGIS.

18:44.837 --> 18:48.340
HE LET A CONTESTANT
CALL UP A FRIEND.

18:48.450 --> 18:50.723
WELL, WHO COULDN'T
WIN A MILLION--

18:50.743 --> 18:52.448
[WHISPERING]
Excuse me, excuse me. Could you--

18:52.448 --> 18:53.736
Would you mind
taking over for me?

18:53.746 --> 18:56.908
Aunt Lydia forgot her cane,
and I gotta, you know, pee.

18:56.934 --> 18:59.201
I'D LIKE TO BE
ON THAT SHOW.

18:59.351 --> 19:00.363
I WOULDN'T
HAVE TO CALL--

19:00.557 --> 19:01.906
BAILEY!

19:01.906 --> 19:04.346
WE'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

19:04.346 --> 19:06.218
HERE HE IS.
I FOUND HIM.

19:06.218 --> 19:07.948
STAND OVER THERE
NEXT TO HOLLY.

19:07.958 --> 19:10.181
NO, BERT.
HE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE TO.

19:10.181 --> 19:12.488
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS
A FAMILY PICTURE. I REALLY SHOULDN'T--

19:12.488 --> 19:13.708
WE INSIST.

19:13.708 --> 19:16.146
COME ON,
GET IN HERE.

19:16.146 --> 19:18.019
GOD, I'M SO SORRY.
LISTEN, JUST HUMOR THEM,

19:18.019 --> 19:21.415
AND THIS WILL
ALL BE OVER REALLY SOON. I PROMISE.

19:21.415 --> 19:24.229
THIS'LL BE YOU AND HOLLY
A YEAR FROM NOW IF SHE HAS HER WAY, HUH?

19:24.506 --> 19:26.292
SMILE EVERYONE!

19:30.951 --> 19:32.519
THERE SHE IS.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.086
THAT'S HER.
THERE SHE IS.

19:34.086 --> 19:35.393
I'VE SEEN
HER PICTURE BEFORE.

19:35.393 --> 19:36.917
WELL, SO GO OVER
AND TALK TO HER.

19:36.917 --> 19:40.488
OK.
WHAT IF SHE SAYS NO?

19:40.488 --> 19:42.795
WHAT IF SHE SAYS YES?

19:42.795 --> 19:44.755
RIGHT.

19:56.773 --> 20:00.476
WOW. HEY,
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

20:00.496 --> 20:02.082
YOU'RE ELAINE CROWE,
RIGHT?

20:02.232 --> 20:04.960
I'M A FRIEND
OF EVAN STILLMAN'S. JULIA SALINGER.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.528
WE SPOKE ONCE,
ACTUALLY.

20:06.528 --> 20:08.444
REALLY?

20:08.444 --> 20:11.143
YEAH. YEAH,
AND HERE WE ARE SPEAKING AGAIN.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.885
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES
OF THAT?

20:12.885 --> 20:16.064
NOT VERY GOOD,
CONSIDERING THIS IS MY PARTY,

20:16.064 --> 20:17.545
AND YOU WEREN'T
ON THE LIST.

20:17.545 --> 20:19.504
OH.

LIKE IN CHINA.
WE CELEB--

32:27.333 --> 32:28.412
WE'RE NOT IN CHINA,
ARE WE?

32:28.412 --> 32:30.589
WE'RE NOT EVEN IN CHINATOWN
NOW, THANKS TO YOU.

32:30.589 --> 32:32.157
GRIFFIN,
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.

32:32.157 --> 32:34.117
BUT I TOLD HIM
TO TAKE MARKET, AND HE DIDN'T.

32:34.117 --> 32:35.754
AND NOW
IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT.

32:35.764 --> 32:39.821
WHOA! LOOK AT THAT!

32:42.825 --> 32:46.004
THAT WAS
KIND OF PERFECT.

32:46.004 --> 32:48.138
YEAH, PERFECT.

32:48.138 --> 32:50.010
OH, WHAT?

32:50.010 --> 32:54.234
THAT PSYCHIC, SHE SAID
I WOULD FIND MY ANSWER

32:54.234 --> 32:56.280
AT WHAT?
AT A GATHERING.

32:56.280 --> 32:57.909
NOT THAT I REALLY
BELIEVED HER,

32:57.939 --> 33:01.245
BUT I THOUGHT
MAYBE AT THE LIT PARTY.

33:01.245 --> 33:04.293
AND WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT,
I THOUGHT, OK, WELL, MAYBE IT MEANS

33:04.293 --> 33:07.210
WITH MY FAMILY AT THE VET'S,
BECAUSE THEN, AT LEAST, I'D HAVE THEM.

33:07.210 --> 33:13.306
BUT NOW, NOW IT'S LIKE,
NO, THE ANSWER IS GIVE IT UP, ALREADY.

33:13.306 --> 33:15.948
THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS
LIKE THE WORLD IS TELLING ME

33:15.988 --> 33:19.490
WHEN I CAN'T EVEN MAKE IT
TO SEE MY POOR DOG AND SAY GOOD-BYE.

33:23.366 --> 33:25.369
YOU SHOULDN'T TELL OWEN.

33:25.369 --> 33:27.198
OF COURSE I'M GOING
TO TELL HIM.

33:27.198 --> 33:28.983
WHY WOULDN'T I
TELL HIM?

33:28.983 --> 33:31.465
BECAUSE IT'S TOO HORRIBLE,
BAILEY.

33:31.465 --> 33:35.514
"THURBER'S IN TERRIBLE PAIN, SO WE'RE
TO GIVE HIM A SHOT THAT MAKES HIM DIE?"

33:35.524 --> 33:36.994
WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?

33:37.044 --> 33:38.650
YOU WANT ME TO LIE TO HIM?

33:38.650 --> 33:40.609
WHY NOT?

33:40.609 --> 33:45.313
WHY NOT TELL HIM WE JUST SENT HIM
SOMEWHERE TO LET HIM GET BETTER?

33:45.313 --> 33:47.620
A DOG FARM OR SOME
ANIMAL HOSPITAL SOMEWHERE?

33:47.620 --> 33:51.322
BECAUSE THEN HE'LL
ASK US WHAT FARM AND WHERE

33:51.322 --> 33:53.374
AND CAN WE VISIT HIM
AND WHY CAN'T WE VISIT HIM?

33:53.414 --> 33:55.502
HE'S ONLY 6.

33:55.502 --> 33:57.809
WHY CAN'T WE
SPARE HIM THIS?

33:57.809 --> 34:04.429
WHY DOES EVERYTHING BAD THAT
HAPPENS HAVE TO BE PUT OUT IN THE OPEN?

34:04.429 --> 34:07.825
CLAUD, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

34:07.825 --> 34:11.831
WHY CAN'T WE JUST
LET HIM BE YOUNG...

34:11.831 --> 34:14.226
A LITTLE BIT LONGER?

34:20.976 --> 34:22.630
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND.

34:22.630 --> 34:26.463
BUT THINK ABOUT THIS.

34:26.463 --> 34:29.597
OWEN HAS A CHANCE
TO SAY GOOD-BYE...

34:31.121 --> 34:33.386
AND NO ONE SHOULD
MISS THAT CHANCE.

34:35.563 --> 34:38.219
DON'T YOU THINK?

34:51.805 --> 34:53.721
THANK YOU
FOR WATCHING THEM.

34:53.721 --> 34:55.115
SURE.

34:57.423 --> 34:59.339
HEY, BUD.

35:01.037 --> 35:04.744
OK, SO YOU--
YOU UNDERSTAND

35:04.804 --> 35:07.351
THAT THURBER'S
REAL SICK, RIGHT?

35:08.483 --> 35:13.404
WELL, THE TRUTH IS

35:13.404 --> 35:15.538
THERE'S NOT A LOT
THAT WE CAN DO

35:15.538 --> 35:18.934
TO HELP HIM--
TO HELP HIM GET BETTER.

35:18.934 --> 35:21.634
SO IF WE
REALLY LOVE HIM,

35:21.634 --> 35:23.267
THEN WHAT WE
HAVE TO DO--

35:23.297 --> 35:26.468
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S THE FAIREST THING FOR HIM.

35:26.468 --> 35:28.819
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

35:36.396 --> 35:39.356
OK, THIS IS THE SPOT,

35:39.356 --> 35:41.141
HIS FAVORITE PLACE
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

35:43.101 --> 35:46.019
UH, ANYBODY WANT
TO SAY SOMETHING?

35:50.591 --> 35:52.028
I DON'T KNOW.

35:53.428 --> 35:55.673
IT'S A NICE VIEW FROM HERE.
I HOPE HE'S HAPPY.

36:02.044 --> 36:03.654
THIS IS SO SAD.

36:03.654 --> 36:06.224
JUST MAKES ME WISH
HE WAS HERE.

36:06.224 --> 36:07.922
HEY...

36:07.922 --> 36:09.969
WHO SAYS HE'S
NOT HERE, OWE?

36:09.969 --> 36:12.973
BAILEY, YOU'RE
HOLDING HIS ASHES.

36:14.845 --> 36:18.068
YEAH, BUT WHO SAYS
YOU CAN'T STILL SEE HIM, YOU KNOW,

36:18.068 --> 36:20.463
LIKE,
IN YOUR HEAD?

36:20.463 --> 36:23.119
YEAH!

36:23.119 --> 36:27.125
YEAH,I SEE HIM
EATING THAT FAMILY'S PICNIC OVER THERE.

36:27.125 --> 36:30.435
HMM. I SEE HIM
PEEING ALL OVER THAT WALL.

36:30.435 --> 36:33.519
WHAT ABOUT THAT
ROPE TOY HE LOVED?

36:33.589 --> 36:36.418
WE'D SPEND HALF OF EVERY AFTERNOON TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT WHERE HE HID THAT THING

36:36.436 --> 36:39.056
OVER BY THAT TREE
AND BEHIND THOSE BUSHES.

36:39.056 --> 36:40.885
[LAUGHTER]

36:40.885 --> 36:44.049
SO WHERE SHOULD WE SPREAD HIM, THEN
MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE SPOT.

36:44.587 --> 36:47.200
HOW ABOUT...EVERYWHERE?

36:49.986 --> 36:51.641
OK.

36:51.641 --> 36:52.948
ALL RIGHT.

36:54.253 --> 36:56.867
EVERYBODY TAKE
A LITTLE HANDFUL.

36:56.867 --> 36:59.784
Julia: YOU KNOW, THIS
MIGHT BE THE FIRST TIME THURBER'S DUMPED

36:59.784 --> 37:01.395
AND WE HAVEN'T
GOTTEN A TICKET.

37:04.095 --> 37:05.968
YEAH, LAY SOME
THURBER ON ME.

37:13.936 --> 37:16.113
Owen: GROW, THURBER.

37:16.113 --> 37:17.768
Kirsten: GOOD-BYE, THURBER.

37:17.768 --> 37:19.466
Bailey: WANT TO
THROW A LITTLE BIT OF THURBER OUT HERE?

38:02.228 --> 38:03.648
HEY.

38:03.988 --> 38:05.667
CHARLIE!

38:05.667 --> 38:07.583
YEAH, YOU CALLED ME.
WHAT'S UP?

38:07.583 --> 38:12.199
HEY, LOOK, WE SAID
SOME THINGS LAST NIGHT-- COME IN.

38:12.199 --> 38:17.486
I WAS FEELING A LITTLE FESTIVE,
A LITTLE WORSE FOR THE WINE, AND...

38:18.208 --> 38:20.559
ANYWAY, I JUST--
I JUST WANTED TO SAY

38:20.559 --> 38:23.390
I HOPE YOU WEREN'T
SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID...

38:23.390 --> 38:25.132
ABOUT QUITTING
AS FOREMAN.

38:26.624 --> 38:27.765
GUS--

38:27.815 --> 38:30.421
IF IT'S
ABOUT THE PARTY, I'LL SAY IT.

38:30.461 --> 38:31.751
YOU WERE RIGHT.

38:31.891 --> 38:35.234
I SHOULDN'T BE SPENDING
SO MUCH MONEY.

38:35.234 --> 38:38.820
JUST--I SEE THESE GUYS, HOW
THEY SWEAT FOR ME DAY AFTER DAY, AND I--

38:38.910 --> 38:40.138
WHAT ABOUT
THE REST OF IT?

38:41.858 --> 38:44.226
MAKING SOMETHING NEW HERE?

38:44.836 --> 38:49.253
CHARLIE, IF I
START SPENDING MONEY I DON'T HAVE,

38:49.263 --> 38:52.956
AND IF ONE THING GOES WRONG,
I'M FINISHED, LIKE THAT.

38:53.219 --> 38:56.964
SO THE ANSWER IS NO THEN.

38:56.964 --> 38:59.824
WELL, WAIT, COME ON.
GUS, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

39:02.189 --> 39:03.800
I NEED WHAT I DO--

39:03.800 --> 39:06.761
I NEED IT TO BE
ABOUT THE FUTURE.

39:06.761 --> 39:10.636
OK? I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE TIME
TO BE MOVING SIDEWAYS.

39:12.161 --> 39:13.599
I'M SORRY.

39:13.639 --> 39:15.993
NOW, CHARLIE, WAIT!

39:17.604 --> 39:21.088
NOW, YOU SAID YOU COULD
BUILD THESE CHAIRS

39:21.088 --> 39:23.221
AND NOT LAY OUT
A LOT OF MONEY.

39:23.221 --> 39:24.789
THAT REALLY TRUE?

39:25.729 --> 39:26.959
DEPENDS. I MEAN,

39:26.999 --> 39:29.491
IF I LINE UP
THE RIGHT CUSTOMERS FIRST, YEAH.

39:29.491 --> 39:32.774
COULD YOU LAY IT OUT
ON PAPER FOR ME,

39:32.834 --> 39:35.239
SEE HOW IT ALL WORKS?

39:35.239 --> 39:37.155
OF COURSE.

39:39.289 --> 39:42.076
IS THAT A YES
THAT WE CAN DO THIS?

39:43.644 --> 39:44.776
WE'LL TRY.

39:46.256 --> 39:48.172
LET'S TRY.

39:51.679 --> 39:54.530
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

39:55.549 --> 39:57.467
HOLLY, YOU REALLY
SHOULDN'T HAVE.

39:58.057 --> 39:59.973
YEAH, WELL,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

39:59.973 --> 40:03.413
I DIDN'T REALLY.
THEY WERE LEFT OVER FROM THE WEDDING.

40:04.340 --> 40:08.464
BUT I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THURBER.

40:08.464 --> 40:10.598
I FEEL SO BAD.
YOU KNOW?

40:10.598 --> 40:14.038
I'M SORRY, TOO.

40:14.038 --> 40:15.892
I SHOULD HAVE THROWN
THAT BOUQUET TO YOU.

40:15.932 --> 40:17.538
- NAH.
- YES.

40:18.653 --> 40:20.221
IT'S OK.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.600
WELL...

40:30.255 --> 40:32.214
HOW ABOUT ONE?

40:32.214 --> 40:35.350
HOW ABOUT
ONE AT A TIME?

40:35.350 --> 40:36.961
HOW WOULD THAT BE?

40:36.961 --> 40:38.659
THAT'S REALLY SWEET.

40:38.659 --> 40:40.226
THANK YOU.

40:43.492 --> 40:45.756
WHAT'S IT MEAN?

40:46.541 --> 40:48.587
IT MEANS...

40:51.853 --> 40:56.567
IT MEANS THAT AS LONG
AS I GET TO BE WITH YOU

40:56.627 --> 40:59.038
AND NOT KNOW WHAT IT MEANS,
THEN I'M HAPPY.

40:59.938 --> 41:02.434
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL I WANT.
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

41:02.434 --> 41:08.052
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THE FUTURE IS YET.

41:16.630 --> 41:18.285
SO...

41:20.419 --> 41:22.161
I'LL SEE YOU...

41:22.161 --> 41:23.336
AHEM.

41:23.336 --> 41:25.252
WHENEVER.

41:36.966 --> 41:40.250
NO WAY. OURS WAS DEFINITELY WORSE.
ARE YOU KIDDING?

41:40.291 --> 41:41.521
WE WERE STUCK
IN A CAB WITH SOME GUY

41:41.541 --> 41:43.152
THAT WAS TELLING US IT WASN'T
EVEN NEW YEARS.

41:43.192 --> 41:45.175
AT LEAST YOU GUYS
SAW FIREWORKS.

41:45.265 --> 41:46.532
EXCUSE ME.

41:46.652 --> 41:49.166
ANIMAL HOSPITAL WATCHING
MY PET BE PUT DOWN.

41:49.376 --> 41:50.908
YOU WIN.

41:50.968 --> 41:52.238
I CAN'T TOP
THAT ONE.

41:52.278 --> 41:55.880
COME ON, GUYS.
IT WAS ONE MILLENNIUM. THERE'LL BE OTHERS.

42:00.453 --> 42:02.006
I'M DEPRESSED.

42:02.076 --> 42:03.365
I MEAN,
WE TOTALLY MISSED IT.

42:03.405 --> 42:05.701
WE MISSED,
LIKE, THE BIGGEST MOMENT EVER.

42:05.831 --> 42:07.942
CLAUD, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE PLANNING TO MISS IT.

42:08.022 --> 42:10.589
I WAS KIDDING MYSELF.
I WATCHED IT ON TV AT THE VET'S.

42:10.835 --> 42:13.090
LAST NIGHT WAS NOT NOTHING.

42:13.150 --> 42:17.922
YEAH, OK, BUT WHO SAID
WE MISSED IT, REALLY?

42:18.032 --> 42:19.464
I DON'T KNOW,
THE CLOCK?

42:19.554 --> 42:21.058
NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

42:21.098 --> 42:23.431
I HAVE SPENT
THE LAST 24 HOURS COMPLAINING

42:23.441 --> 42:25.471
THE WORLD SAID
I WASN'T GOING TO HAVE MY MOMENT.

42:26.361 --> 42:28.523
WHATEVER IT WAS,
MY BOOK COMING OUT,

42:28.563 --> 42:31.068
MY NEW MILLENNIUM EVE
TO REMEMBER.

42:31.168 --> 42:33.807
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

42:33.807 --> 42:36.236
WHO SAYS THE WORLD CAN
DECIDE THAT FOR ME--

42:36.526 --> 42:37.872
WHAT MY MOMENT
SHOULD BE?

42:37.902 --> 42:40.470
WHO SAYS WE CAN'T ALL
DECIDE FOR OURSELVES?

42:40.470 --> 42:43.432
WANT TO WAKE UP DICK CLARK,
RAISE THAT BALL AGAIN?

42:43.432 --> 42:45.783
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JULIA'S RIGHT.

42:45.783 --> 42:47.565
OH, ACCEPT IT, YOU GUYS.

42:47.785 --> 42:51.095
Y2K--NOT
A SALINGER HOLIDAY.

42:55.687 --> 42:57.025
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY?

42:58.115 --> 42:59.630
I SAY...

42:59.957 --> 43:02.243
10...

43:02.243 --> 43:04.118
9...

43:04.638 --> 43:07.468
All except Claudia:
8...

43:07.468 --> 43:09.471
7...

43:09.471 --> 43:10.540
6...

43:10.580 --> 43:11.992
5...

43:12.032 --> 43:13.267
4...

43:13.497 --> 43:14.713
3...

43:14.783 --> 43:18.267
2...ONE!
[CHEERING]
