(mellow music playing)

01:00.400 --> 01:02.867
-This was a lovely afternoon.
-I'll say.

01:02.934 --> 01:05.133
I just love the legitimate theater.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.233
I missed Lee J. Cobb
in <i>Death of a Salesman,</i>

01:08.300 --> 01:11.100
and Marlon Brando in
<i>Streetcar Named Desire,</i>

01:11.166 --> 01:15.433
but I wouldn't miss Dick Butkus
in <i>Pal Joey.</i>

01:16.734 --> 01:18.967
There's a brand-new
water heater in the garage

01:19.033 --> 01:21.300
and carpeting in the bedrooms.

01:21.367 --> 01:23.967
-What are you doing?
-Selling the house.

01:25.567 --> 01:27.100
That's a working fireplace.

01:27.166 --> 01:31.767
With these cathedral ceilings,
you could stack 50 VCRs.

01:31.834 --> 01:35.834
So you think it over,
and if you're interested, give us a call.

01:36.166 --> 01:37.900
I make offer now.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.867
If you like, you call me.

01:43.900 --> 01:46.800
Sophia, you can't just sell my house.

01:47.633 --> 01:50.667
-Is this in dollars?
-No, it's in cucumber rolls.

01:51.133 --> 01:52.767
Of course it is.

01:52.834 --> 01:54.867
Sophia, what's this all about?

01:54.934 --> 01:58.066
I didn't put the "for sale" sign
on our lawn.

01:58.133 --> 01:59.467
What?

02:01.200 --> 02:02.934
Oh, damn!

02:03.300 --> 02:06.200
Those Donaldson boys
must have moved that sign

02:06.266 --> 02:10.700
-from the Mackenzie's front lawn to ours.
-Then it's a mistake.

02:10.767 --> 02:13.500
Yeah, but this sure isn't.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.400
Oh...

02:18.767 --> 02:20.967
Blanche, what do you mean?

02:21.033 --> 02:24.233
Would you seriously consider
selling the house?

02:24.734 --> 02:27.266
Well, no. I mean, I don't think so.

02:28.233 --> 02:31.233
You have to admit,
this is a lot of money...

02:31.633 --> 02:34.033
more than I think the house is worth.

02:34.100 --> 02:38.433
As your agent, 3% of it is mine.
What do you say, Blanchie?

02:38.500 --> 02:39.834
Do we close the deal?

02:40.367 --> 02:42.700
This is all so sudden.

02:43.100 --> 02:44.800
There are many things to consider.

02:44.867 --> 02:48.400
Blanche, if you're worried about us,
don't be.

02:48.467 --> 02:53.400
Your selling the house doesn't mean
we can't find another place together.

02:53.467 --> 02:54.834
I wasn't worried about you.

02:54.900 --> 02:58.734
I was worried about the tax consequences
of this income.

03:01.667 --> 03:05.133
I'm kidding. I love you.
You're my family.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.734
We're sticking together no matter what.

03:07.800 --> 03:12.100
It might be hard
to find a place as perfect as this.

03:12.166 --> 03:16.033
We can do it again with a little luck.

03:16.100 --> 03:18.834
Luck brought us together
the first time.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.333
I will never forget

03:21.400 --> 03:24.500
when I first put up that notice
at the supermarket.

03:32.867 --> 03:35.467
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

03:35.533 --> 03:39.300
I know what's wrong.
I can read it in your face.

03:39.367 --> 03:41.000
-You can?
-Sure.

03:41.300 --> 03:45.200
Your husband or your boyfriend dumped you.
Don't let it get you down.

03:45.266 --> 03:49.000
They'd do it in the mud if they had to.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.400
You just go sleep with his best friend,
that will even the score.

03:58.533 --> 04:00.400
Am I on <i>Candid Camera?</i>

04:03.033 --> 04:07.467
-You didn't get dumped?
-Well, actually, I did, by my landlord.

04:07.533 --> 04:11.567
He threw me out of my apartment.
But I couldn't sleep with his best friend.

04:11.934 --> 04:15.567
He's over 80 years old
and thinks he's the Archduke Ferdinand.

04:17.400 --> 04:18.667
Why were you thrown out?

04:19.033 --> 04:23.033
The building's owners don't allow cats.
I can't part with Mr. Peepers.

04:23.100 --> 04:26.166
You two must have been
through a lot together.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.600
Yes. I found him last week.

04:30.033 --> 04:32.800
I wouldn't feel right
having a home if he didn't.

04:32.867 --> 04:36.934
-We've become very attached.
-That shows strength of character.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.567
I like you. I like cats.
I'm renting out a room.

04:40.633 --> 04:42.200
The name's Blanche Devereaux.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.600
Why would you name a room
Blanche Devereaux?

04:47.333 --> 04:50.033
Oh, it's been such a lovely day.

04:50.300 --> 04:54.900
Mr. Sunshine gave us
one of his biggest and brightest smiles.

04:55.867 --> 04:59.834
I could put my arms around mother nature
and give her a big kiss.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.867
-You must be Dorothy.
-And you must be Mrs. Rogers.

05:07.567 --> 05:12.233
-I didn't catch your name.
-I'm Rose Nyland, your new roomie.

05:13.033 --> 05:17.033
Blanche has told me all about you.
Sorry, your husband dumped you.

05:18.934 --> 05:21.166
You can borrow my bubble
bath any time you want.

05:21.700 --> 05:24.834
That will help ease the lonely nights,
thank you.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.467
Oh I see you too are getting acquainted.

05:27.533 --> 05:29.667
Yes, I'm just going to take
my stuff to my room.

05:29.734 --> 05:32.200
It's the second on the
left down the hall there.

05:32.266 --> 05:35.967
Dorothy, the second on the left is mine,
Blanche had promised it to me.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.066
Blanche promised it to me too, didn't you,
Blanche?

05:39.133 --> 05:40.333
Whoops.

05:41.767 --> 05:46.166
Well, great, great, what are we
supposed to do now?

05:46.567 --> 05:51.000
Back in Minnesota we'd settle this dispute
with some good natured log rolling.

05:51.934 --> 05:54.333
Sorry, Rose, my log is in the shop.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.133
What do we do now, toss a coin?

05:58.200 --> 05:59.467
-Okay.
-All right.

05:59.900 --> 06:02.166
-I'll take tails.
-Okay.

06:05.133 --> 06:06.500
Tails, you win.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.867
I'll make it up to you, Dorothy,
I promise.

06:08.934 --> 06:11.100
If there is ever a night
where you can't sleep,

06:11.166 --> 06:13.633
I'll come to your room and sing "Kumbaya".

06:15.667 --> 06:17.900
Rose, I don't know what to say.

06:18.567 --> 06:19.834
Yes, I do.

06:21.266 --> 06:22.967
Don't ever do that.

06:25.667 --> 06:28.667
It just doesn't seem possible
that five years has gone by

06:28.734 --> 06:30.200
since we moved in together.

06:30.767 --> 06:34.734
It's going to be rough
if we have to go our separate ways.

06:34.800 --> 06:39.166
-We all depend on each other.
-Especially Rose.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.000
What's that supposed to mean?

06:41.066 --> 06:45.967
Oh, honey, it just means sometimes
you're a bit naive, simple, childlike.

06:46.033 --> 06:50.166
She's calling you a moron.
You don't want to live with her.

06:50.233 --> 06:51.433
Ma.

06:51.500 --> 06:55.967
There are lots of things
I can do better than you guys.

06:56.033 --> 06:58.800
-Name one.
-Can you tighten a horn on a helmet?

06:59.367 --> 07:03.400
Smoke a herring in a log?
Check a bull for a hernia?

07:04.467 --> 07:08.667
The rough part is getting him
to turn his head and cough.

07:11.734 --> 07:17.166
-Pick a category we can compete in.
-What about that dance marathon?

07:17.233 --> 07:20.734
-Whose butt got whupped that night?
-How did you know Wally...

07:21.333 --> 07:23.967
oh, you mean at the actual
dance marathon.

07:24.333 --> 07:28.633
That's right.
I showed you guys a thing or two.

07:32.233 --> 07:34.900
Ladies and gentlemen,
our charity dance marathon

07:34.967 --> 07:38.000
is now entering its seventh hour.

07:38.066 --> 07:41.033
Let's give our contestants
a great big hand.

07:41.100 --> 07:44.533
(applause)

07:47.300 --> 07:49.567
-How are you girls holding up?
-Fine.

07:49.633 --> 07:51.166
Terrific.

07:51.233 --> 07:55.767
This reminds me of the big dance
that kicks off St. Olaf's pretzel week.

07:56.266 --> 08:01.367
-After the great beer nut shortage--
-Foul! Foul! Send a judge here.

08:01.433 --> 08:03.900
This woman's trying to put us to sleep.

08:08.367 --> 08:11.066
You're exhausted,
and you're trying to blame me.

08:11.133 --> 08:14.700
Exhausted?
I'll show you who's exhausted.

08:14.767 --> 08:19.367
Maestro...
how about something with a little octane?

08:19.433 --> 08:22.700
Ok, little lady.
All right, boys! Take it away!

08:22.767 --> 08:25.400
Uh-1, 2... uh-1, 2, 3, 4...

08:25.467 --> 08:29.166
("In The Mood" plays)

08:48.400 --> 08:50.567
Out of our way, amateurs.

09:05.567 --> 09:09.633
-Blanche, you mind if I give it a try?
-For heaven's sake, go on.

09:10.734 --> 09:13.600
I better do this by myself.
You might get hurt.

09:17.967 --> 09:19.367
3, 4...

09:19.800 --> 09:25.700
("Sing, Sing, Sing" plays)

09:46.100 --> 09:52.767
(audience clapping and cheering)

09:58.867 --> 10:01.867
(calm music playing)

10:01.934 --> 10:03.800
Girls, I'm really worried.

10:04.066 --> 10:05.900
Usually by the time
I've finished a cheesecake,

10:05.967 --> 10:09.633
I can solve any problem,
but I'm coming up empty.

10:09.700 --> 10:12.233
Then why's the top button
on your skirt open?

10:14.500 --> 10:18.633
I'm talking about selling the house.
I don't know if I should.

10:18.700 --> 10:23.800
Well, you don't have to decide tonight.
Take all the time you need.

10:23.867 --> 10:28.767
The point is, if you turn a nice buck
on this place today,

10:28.834 --> 10:34.333
-you can buy a better place tomorrow.
-I'm not sure I want a new house.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.000
Maybe I want to travel first.

10:37.066 --> 10:40.934
I have relatives scattered all over
this country.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.667
If it's relatives you want,
you should stay in Miami.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.934
Howard Johnson's does less business
than this house has.

10:49.467 --> 10:53.066
That's true. We've all had our share
of family showing up.

10:54.333 --> 10:57.100
-I think things are going very nicely.
-Save it, Ma.

10:57.166 --> 10:59.100
I am going to tell uncle Angelo the truth.

10:59.166 --> 11:02.934
-It's only for a couple of hours more.
-Ma, I can't do it.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.667
Pretending we're married,
acting as though nothing happened

11:05.734 --> 11:06.734
it's making me crazy.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.467
It's time to take my heart medicine.

11:09.533 --> 11:11.567
You need a glass of water
to take your pill?

11:11.633 --> 11:15.433
No pills, I take a shot of scotch,
12 years old if you got it.

11:17.233 --> 11:19.266
Uncle Angelo, I have a confession to make.

11:19.333 --> 11:21.800
Good, I get my scotch
and we go in the closet.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.066
No, it's about Stan and me.

11:26.133 --> 11:30.100
You know something, Dorothy,
on your wedding day...

11:30.567 --> 11:34.300
Sophia told me your marriage
never gonna last.

11:34.367 --> 11:36.066
That made me very sad.

11:36.533 --> 11:41.467
And now to see you and Stan so happy
after all of these years...

11:41.533 --> 11:44.266
it does an old man's heart good.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.200
And so does that.

11:51.533 --> 11:52.533
Uncle Angelo...

11:52.600 --> 11:55.934
I am so glad I disobeyed
the doctor's orders...

11:56.300 --> 12:00.533
and risked this long trip to see
the both of you so much in love.

12:01.433 --> 12:02.834
Now, what were you saying?

12:05.333 --> 12:08.066
Uncle Angelo, I wanted to say...

12:10.266 --> 12:15.867
don't just stand there, papa bear,
come give mama bear a big bear hug.

12:18.166 --> 12:21.433
-Can I get you more cake?
-No, thank you.

12:21.934 --> 12:25.533
-I'll take a slice, darling.
-No problem, sweetheart.

12:25.600 --> 12:29.800
-Hurry back, dumpling.
-My feet have wings, barf bag.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.000
Dorothy, hang in there.

12:38.066 --> 12:41.633
A little while longer,
and Angelo will be headed for Brooklyn.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.834
I wish I'd taken my raincoat.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.433
Why are you two dressed like that?

12:51.500 --> 12:54.433
These are our costumes for the play,
Dorothy.

12:54.500 --> 12:57.967
We were rehearsing when
they told us to go home.

12:58.033 --> 13:00.200
A hurricane's heading for Miami.

13:00.700 --> 13:03.667
I think I will have cake... hello.

13:03.734 --> 13:07.967
Uncle Angelo, I'd, uh...
like you to meet, uh...

13:08.800 --> 13:12.467
-I'm sister Rose.
-Nice to meet you.

13:12.533 --> 13:15.166
-I'm sister Blanche.
-Yes, indeed.

13:15.767 --> 13:19.633
We're here, uh, collecting...
uh, lingerie...

13:21.333 --> 13:23.200
for needy sexy people.

13:28.567 --> 13:30.800
I just heard on TV
the airports are closed.

13:30.867 --> 13:33.700
A hurricane's headed this way.

13:33.767 --> 13:37.900
-We could be trapped together for days!
-Oh, Jesus!

13:42.233 --> 13:46.033
Please protect and watch over us
in this our hour of need.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.600
Amen.

13:50.133 --> 13:52.400
-Ah, Lucy.
-Aunt Blanche!

13:52.700 --> 13:56.667
Meet my friends.
This is Sophia, Dorothy, and Rose.

13:56.734 --> 14:00.233
-Nice to meet you.
-Let me look at you, girl.

14:01.266 --> 14:04.800
Terrific little figure,
gorgeous hair, perfect skin...

14:04.867 --> 14:06.600
just like looking in a mirror.

14:07.967 --> 14:09.333
Get some Windex.

14:11.700 --> 14:14.700
-How was your trip?
-Oh, it was wonderful.

14:14.767 --> 14:18.500
I met a gorgeous
single doctor on the plane.

14:18.567 --> 14:22.133
At 30,000 feet, she picks up a doctor.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.066
I see the family resemblance.

14:24.567 --> 14:27.200
I'm supposed to meet him in a half hour.

14:27.266 --> 14:29.166
Darling, you just got here.

14:29.233 --> 14:33.567
But you always said, "If a stallion's
eating oats out of your hand,

14:33.633 --> 14:35.500
close the gate before
you give him the sugar."

14:37.367 --> 14:39.100
You said that, Blanche.

14:40.633 --> 14:44.200
I won't go,
if you don't want me to.

14:44.266 --> 14:45.533
Would your mother let you?

14:45.600 --> 14:47.066
-No.
-Then go.

14:47.734 --> 14:51.900
Thank you. You're the best.
I'll see y'all later.

14:53.533 --> 14:56.000
Isn't she something?
I'm really proud of her.

14:56.567 --> 14:59.700
Now if I could rope a doctor that easily.

14:59.767 --> 15:03.333
I don't think there's enough sugar
left in the bowl.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.900
That was the best meal I've ever had.

15:07.967 --> 15:11.934
-You left half of it.
-I ate every bite.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.734
If you liked it, you'd sop up that sauce
with some bread.

15:16.800 --> 15:17.934
You can afford it.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.600
No, I can't. I've gained a few pounds.
You just haven't noticed.

15:21.667 --> 15:22.900
What, am I blind?

15:24.600 --> 15:30.567
I can see that. I meant the bread.
It's only 89 cents a loaf.

15:31.266 --> 15:33.200
Angela, sit. I'll serve dessert.

15:33.266 --> 15:38.033
You two made such a fantastic meal.
I can't imagine what's for dessert.

15:38.100 --> 15:40.033
-I made dessert.
-Damn!

15:43.900 --> 15:46.500
-What did you say, Blanche?
-Yum. I said yum.

15:48.367 --> 15:52.734
Rose, is this another one
of those Scandinavian-Viking concoctions?

15:52.800 --> 15:57.066
Yes.
It's called genügenflürgen cake.

16:00.166 --> 16:03.367
It's an ancient recipe,
but I Americanized it.

16:03.433 --> 16:06.767
One might say you brought geflürgennügen
into the eighties?

16:08.400 --> 16:12.233
Yes, but I'm not one to blow
my own vertubenfluggen.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.934
I can't even reach mine.

16:23.367 --> 16:27.567
Sophia, have you had a chance
to catch up on old times?

16:27.633 --> 16:31.467
Angela filled me in
on all my friends and family.

16:31.533 --> 16:33.867
-How is everybody, Angela?
-Dead.

16:35.834 --> 16:38.900
Angela and I are the only two left
of the original family.

16:38.967 --> 16:42.233
Does that mean you're alone in Sicily,
Angela?

16:42.300 --> 16:43.700
No, I have a goat.

16:45.433 --> 16:49.033
It's a shame you and ma
don't live closer together.

16:49.367 --> 16:53.567
Dorothy's right.
How many years do we have left, 20, 30?

16:55.000 --> 16:58.734
-We should live closer.
-You want to return to Sicily?

16:58.800 --> 17:01.600
Do I look like someone
who beats laundry on a rock?

17:02.834 --> 17:07.300
-Come here to Miami.
-Angela, you would love Miami.

17:07.367 --> 17:08.767
What do you say?

17:08.834 --> 17:13.100
I'm too old to pick up and move
to a strange country.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.934
Before your husband died,
you lived here for 30 years.

17:18.100 --> 17:22.300
-I don't know.
-Who would you rather live with,

17:22.367 --> 17:25.433
-your sister or a goat?
-Give me a minute.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.900
-Cousin Rose?
-Cousin Sven!

17:33.300 --> 17:38.266
Oh, let me look at you.
Boy, have you grown.

17:39.166 --> 17:42.967
-We've never met.
-But admit it, you have grown.

17:45.033 --> 17:48.600
Uh, Rose...
could you introduce Blanche and me?

17:48.667 --> 17:52.633
Oh, of course. Dorothy, this is Blanche.
Blanche, this is Dorothy.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.066
We have jokes like that all the time.

17:57.567 --> 18:00.467
It's like living in a house full
of Howie Mandels.

18:01.133 --> 18:02.900
-I'm Dorothy.
-Hello.

18:02.967 --> 18:05.367
-And I'm Blanche. Welcome.
-Thank you.

18:05.433 --> 18:10.066
-Rose says you're getting married.
-Yes, I hope I'm good at it.

18:10.500 --> 18:15.767
-I'm not experienced with women.
-A big, strong, handsome thing like you?

18:15.834 --> 18:16.967
Get out of here.

18:17.767 --> 18:19.767
Well, it was nice meeting all of you.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.834
Oh, no! That was an expression. Sven?

18:27.333 --> 18:31.400
I never thought I'd say this, but I think
Rose got the brains in that family.

18:33.734 --> 18:35.800
Let's make a pact.

18:35.867 --> 18:40.900
If we keep this house, we're going to
limit the number of relatives who visit.

18:40.967 --> 18:43.867
-(knock on door)
-Who could that be?

18:43.934 --> 18:47.033
-It's probably no one.
-Hi, it's me, Stan.

18:47.100 --> 18:50.667
What did I tell you? What do you want?

18:50.734 --> 18:52.667
-A car.
-No.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.834
Doesn't anybody want to know why?

18:55.900 --> 18:59.266
-(ladies) No.
-I know when I'm not wanted.

18:59.734 --> 19:04.600
Is anybody eating that?
Why do you want the car?

19:04.667 --> 19:07.533
I am involved in a new business venture.

19:07.867 --> 19:09.667
Stan's pizzas.

19:10.133 --> 19:13.800
The gimmick is, I can deliver a pizza
faster than domino's.

19:14.133 --> 19:15.800
-There's only one problem.
-What?

19:15.867 --> 19:18.700
It's impossible.
I cracked up my car trying.

19:19.934 --> 19:23.567
You want to use our cars
to deliver pizzas?

19:23.633 --> 19:27.567
Actually, I'd like for you
to be my drivers.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.300
I belong in the office.

19:29.367 --> 19:33.734
Supervising, franchising, teasing
the high school girls that work for me.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.667
I just lost you.

19:38.300 --> 19:42.266
I'm out of the pizza business.
Is there anything else to eat?

19:42.333 --> 19:46.200
Why do you always come here
with your problems?

19:46.266 --> 19:48.734
-You're my best friends.
-We don't like you.

19:49.633 --> 19:51.934
You're still my best friends.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.600
You can't depend on coming around here
forever.

19:54.667 --> 19:56.867
Blanche is considering selling the house.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.300
Selling our house?

20:00.433 --> 20:02.667
You can't be serious.
We've had great times here.

20:02.734 --> 20:06.900
We have had great times here.
You've just had free food.

20:06.967 --> 20:11.000
That is not true. We've had a million
laughs under this roof.

20:11.734 --> 20:15.133
Do you remember
the time I came over...

20:16.333 --> 20:19.333
Dorothy, it's been a while, but try
and control yourself. I need some rest.

20:22.633 --> 20:25.433
-What the hell is that for?
-You're not sleeping here.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.100
-Where then?
-On the floor, like any dog.

20:28.166 --> 20:29.200
Well, fine.

20:30.367 --> 20:35.300
Stan Zbornak doesn't have to beg a woman
to get into bed. Women come to me.

20:35.367 --> 20:38.533
Right after they get the approval number
on your Mastercard.

20:41.333 --> 20:43.433
-Good night.
-Oh, shut up.

20:53.066 --> 20:58.000
(laughs)

20:59.800 --> 21:03.200
Stanley, if you're doing what I think
you're doing, you're in big trouble.

21:08.633 --> 21:13.400
I was just remembering
the first time you kicked me out of bed

21:13.467 --> 21:14.567
and I had to sleep on the floor.

21:15.100 --> 21:18.967
Emile Zunt's hidden honeymoon hideaway
in the Poconos.

21:19.533 --> 21:24.800
"Where every cottage is April in Paris."
And every bathroom, Calcutta in July.

21:26.867 --> 21:28.767
Remember how I convinced you
to let me back into bed?

21:29.700 --> 21:30.834
No.

I don't think so.

21:51.500 --> 21:55.500
-I'll have to pull out the big gun.
-You're wasting your time, Stanley.

21:55.567 --> 21:57.567

Dorothy, Dorothy,
I've just had a terrible nightmare.

22:22.767 --> 22:24.834
-Ma, what was it?
-This.

22:27.333 --> 22:28.367
Break it up.

22:29.567 --> 22:32.834
Stanley, think of me as the Berlin wall.

22:32.900 --> 22:34.700
Try to climb over me

22:34.767 --> 22:37.734
and you'll know what barbed wire
between your legs feels like.

22:39.300 --> 22:40.333
Got you.

22:41.600 --> 22:45.233
-Dorothy, how did this start, Cole Porter?
-Gershwin.

22:46.300 --> 22:48.500
Thank God I came in time.

22:52.700 --> 22:56.467
-We've certainly had some good times.
-Yes, we have.

22:56.533 --> 23:00.333
We'd like to have more,
so would you leave?

23:02.066 --> 23:04.734
-I've made a decision.
-What, Blanche?

23:04.800 --> 23:05.800
(telephone rings)

23:05.867 --> 23:08.533
There's too many memories here.

23:08.600 --> 23:12.033
I'm not going to trade them
for a few dollars.

23:12.100 --> 23:17.000
-It's Yakamora. He's doubled his offer.
-We'll be out by the first of the month.

23:28.934 --> 23:33.734
(theme music playing)
