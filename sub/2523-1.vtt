THE TARGET

03:37.917 --> 03:39.282
Emergency patient!

03:45.525 --> 03:46.890
Was it a car accident?

03:47.193 --> 03:48.125
Sir, wake up please.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.226
Bring the hypertensor.

03:50.863 --> 03:52.990
Any sign of fracture?

03:58.371 --> 03:59.633
Isn't this a gunshot wound?

04:01.674 --> 04:03.938
Doctor, shouldn't we
call the police?

04:04.377 --> 04:05.605
Yes.

Hands.

See her moving?

04:22.128 --> 04:23.959
- Hey.
- How's it going?

04:24.030 --> 04:25.861
She has postural hypotension.

04:26.165 --> 04:27.029
Really?

04:27.300 --> 04:28.232
It's all right.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.698
I'll get you some
iron supplements.

04:30.837 --> 04:31.804
Thanks.

Get back to work.

04:40.747 --> 04:42.882
There are plenty of nurses.

04:42.882 --> 04:43.871
I'll walk you out.

04:49.155 --> 04:50.247
I'll be there.

04:50.556 --> 04:51.716
I'm going!

04:52.558 --> 04:54.060
- Sorry.
- Hurry up.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.027
I'm sorry.

04:55.261 --> 04:57.030
I'll make breakfast.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.031
Okay.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.896
Don't let me be a
bad husband anymore.

Don't be late.

05:01.834 --> 05:02.835
Baekwoon Hospital

05:02.835 --> 05:05.998
I feel so lonely.

05:06.539 --> 05:08.941
Just give me one shot.

05:08.941 --> 05:10.476
Sir, you can't do this here.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.679
Convenience stores
won't sell me corn sugar.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.414
I'm so lonely.

05:14.414 --> 05:15.682
- Call security.
- Yes, sir.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.013
Corn sugar...

05:17.083 --> 05:19.449
- Shit.
- Stop this.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.592
- Please stand up.
- Okay, I'll go.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.921
You'll hurt me.

05:39.205 --> 05:40.229
Excuse me.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.368
Excuse me, sir.

05:46.913 --> 05:48.141
What happened?

05:49.082 --> 05:50.879
Why're all the lines severed?

05:54.120 --> 05:55.747
- Get an ambu bag.
- Okay.

05:56.122 --> 05:57.589
A defibrillator, quick!

06:21.514 --> 06:22.708
He's okay.

06:25.518 --> 06:27.086
Check him every 1 0 minutes
and report back to me.

06:27.086 --> 06:28.110
Yes, Doctor.

06:29.522 --> 06:30.454
Doctor.

06:30.523 --> 06:31.785
What took you so long?

06:32.859 --> 06:34.520
- Hand me the lV kit.
- Okay.

06:37.764 --> 06:39.163
Sorry, Dr. Lee.

06:55.281 --> 06:56.949
I'll put the iron supplements here.

06:56.949 --> 06:57.916
Okay.

06:59.852 --> 07:00.750
Come here.

07:00.820 --> 07:01.684
What's up?

07:02.255 --> 07:03.552

07:04.357 --> 07:05.483
What's this?

07:07.927 --> 07:08.916
Ta-da!

07:09.228 --> 07:10.991
Wow, this is nice!

07:12.265 --> 07:14.961
When did you have
the time to get this?

07:18.104 --> 07:19.731
What?

07:21.307 --> 07:23.298
You look so sexy today.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.134
I should just jump on you.

07:26.412 --> 07:28.380
What's wrong with you?

07:36.923 --> 07:38.288
Did you take your
iron supplements?

07:38.391 --> 07:40.325
I bet you didn't.

07:41.928 --> 07:44.055
- Hee-joo.
- Tae-jun!

07:52.472 --> 07:55.305
Tae-jun!

08:04.684 --> 08:07.551
Tae-jun!

08:27.707 --> 08:29.742
Hee-joo!

08:29.742 --> 08:30.731
- Shut up!
- Hee-joo!

08:32.144 --> 08:33.634
From here on,

08:35.081 --> 08:36.571
ifyou don't do as I say,

08:37.383 --> 08:38.850
this woman will die.

08:40.653 --> 08:42.381
What is it you want from me?

08:42.688 --> 08:43.552
1 3

08:44.891 --> 08:46.415
Patient number 13.

08:46.926 --> 08:49.895
Bring him out of the hospital.

08:49.996 --> 08:50.928
What?

08:51.030 --> 08:54.727
If you fail or call the police...

08:57.870 --> 08:59.337
Hello?
Hello?

08:59.438 --> 09:01.599
Hello?

09:02.174 --> 09:04.506
Hello?

09:04.911 --> 09:06.776
Hee-joo!

09:07.280 --> 09:08.247
Hello?

09:13.619 --> 09:16.213
Doctor, but you're
off this morning.

09:16.322 --> 09:17.482
I switched shifts.

09:19.058 --> 09:20.423
Who is that man?

09:21.193 --> 09:22.319
He's a detective.

09:22.428 --> 09:23.563
As he wakes up,

09:23.563 --> 09:25.793
they'll move him
to the police hospital.

09:26.532 --> 09:27.760
Really?

09:28.134 --> 09:30.568
Yes, Chief.
I'm in the emergency room.

09:31.003 --> 09:31.935
Hello.

09:32.071 --> 09:32.969
How's it going?

09:33.105 --> 09:33.806
Okay.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.569
- Where is he?
- Right here.

09:36.042 --> 09:37.076
You're here early.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.377
Who's the patient's doctor?

09:38.377 --> 09:39.810
It's...

09:40.012 --> 09:41.447
I'm the doctor.

09:41.447 --> 09:43.005
Right here.

09:44.817 --> 09:46.978
Inspector Jung Young-joo,
At Central Police Department

09:49.021 --> 09:52.081
Can you tell me the patient's
condition when he arrived?

09:55.294 --> 09:56.283
Doctor?

09:57.263 --> 09:58.287
Doctor?

09:59.031 --> 09:59.865
Yes?

09:59.865 --> 10:00.957
Oh my.

10:01.233 --> 10:02.996
You're bleeding.
Are you okay?

10:03.402 --> 10:04.391
You are bleeding.

10:06.739 --> 10:07.933
It's nothing.

10:08.407 --> 10:09.465
Get me a gown.

10:15.514 --> 10:18.108
This is no ordinary body.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.047
Who is he?

10:21.153 --> 10:25.920
His cell phone is smashed
and can't be recovered.

10:26.025 --> 10:28.027
I processed
the fingerprints, but...

10:28.027 --> 10:31.230
The lab says it'll
take some time.

10:31.230 --> 10:32.993
Tell them to hurry it up.

10:33.099 --> 10:36.899
I told them that,
but you know those bastards.

10:37.036 --> 10:38.128
Sorry.

10:38.704 --> 10:39.538
Did you find out?

10:39.538 --> 10:41.631
It's a murder case at
Myungjin Building.

10:41.741 --> 10:43.309
The victim is Yang Dong-suk.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.110
Myungjin Building?

10:44.110 --> 10:46.203
- Yang owned the building.
- Okay.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.380
Come join us here for now.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.280
Yes, ma'am.

10:48.280 --> 10:49.508
Did she find something?

10:49.615 --> 10:50.877
A murder.

10:51.751 --> 10:53.116
He's the prime suspect.

10:53.352 --> 10:55.582
Guard him well.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.089
Excuse me.

11:13.372 --> 11:15.772
Hey, what're you doing?

11:16.542 --> 11:18.703
He needs a CT scan.

11:18.811 --> 11:21.006
You can't move him
without permission.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.441
We have to check for
intracerebral hemorrhages.

11:24.550 --> 11:28.452
He's a murder suspect.
Bring an official statement.

11:31.691 --> 11:35.024
The nurse said he'll regain
consciousness soon.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.018
What's wrong?

12:00.386 --> 12:01.648
He's going into
temporary shock.

12:01.754 --> 12:02.354
What?

12:02.354 --> 12:04.345
I told you
I need to check him!

12:13.499 --> 12:15.433
Shit.

12:15.868 --> 12:17.199
When did you leave?

12:17.303 --> 12:18.637
Without even telling me.

12:18.637 --> 12:20.070
What's wrong with you?

12:24.577 --> 12:26.101
Where did they go?

12:26.512 --> 12:27.706
I'm calling him.

12:30.983 --> 12:32.184
- Hello?
- What?

12:32.184 --> 12:32.985
Where are you?

12:32.985 --> 12:35.154
In the elevator with the doctor,
going for a CT scan.

12:35.154 --> 12:36.314
- CT?
- Yes.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.389
What did he say?

12:37.823 --> 12:39.757
He's with the doctor,
going for a CT scan.

12:39.859 --> 12:41.554
He's in the elevator.

12:42.194 --> 12:44.253
The CT room's
on the first floor.

12:45.231 --> 12:46.163
Gyu-ho.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.392
The CT room's on the 1 st floor.
Where're you going?

12:48.768 --> 12:49.792
Follow me.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.710
What the fuck...

13:00.112 --> 13:02.706
What're you doing?

13:03.549 --> 13:05.380
Watch the head!

13:08.788 --> 13:10.312
Shit.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.694
Stay put!

13:22.968 --> 13:24.230
I have my reasons for this.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.405
Whatever.

13:26.405 --> 13:28.464
I'm serious.
I have my reasons.

13:33.345 --> 13:34.471
You fucking asshole!

13:41.153 --> 13:42.245
Police.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.887
Open up the screen
for the elevator.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.756
Hey, wake up.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.033
You feel all right?
Can you walk?

14:02.775 --> 14:03.935
What the hell?

14:05.911 --> 14:07.105
Chief, call me with your order.

14:07.246 --> 14:08.110
Hurry.

14:08.414 --> 14:09.715
We need to go right now.

14:09.715 --> 14:11.774
Otherwise, my wife will die.

14:13.452 --> 14:16.683
How did I get here?

14:16.889 --> 14:20.086
A car accident,
you came in an ambulance.

14:20.459 --> 14:21.483
Was I alone?

14:21.961 --> 14:23.019
Yes.

14:23.796 --> 14:24.956
Who's that guy?

14:25.064 --> 14:26.190
Police.

14:26.265 --> 14:28.495
He said you're a murder suspect.

14:32.137 --> 14:33.263
You have to...

14:33.772 --> 14:35.433
You have to come with me.

14:39.678 --> 14:41.543
Wait.

14:42.481 --> 14:44.210
Wait.

14:44.350 --> 14:45.112
Wait.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.912
Someone kidnapped my wife

14:47.019 --> 14:49.146
and ordered me to get
you out of the hospital.

14:49.488 --> 14:51.456
We don't have much time.
Please, I beg you.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.718
Please.

15:02.601 --> 15:03.397
Please wait.

15:03.669 --> 15:04.829
We have to go together.

15:04.937 --> 15:06.131
Wait.

15:06.939 --> 15:09.041
We have to go together.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.776
Please, sir.
Please.

15:10.776 --> 15:13.973
Son of a bitch!

15:15.214 --> 15:17.016
Please locate the guy
who just left.

15:17.016 --> 15:20.247
There're no surveillance cameras on
the 7th floor because of construction.

15:47.179 --> 15:48.305
Gyu-ho, get up.

15:50.215 --> 15:51.083
Yes, Chief.

15:51.083 --> 15:52.284
Come down through
the emergency staircase.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.308
Yes, Chief.

15:57.589 --> 15:58.556
Be quiet.

16:06.832 --> 16:07.924
That wheelchair guy.

16:08.334 --> 16:09.733
Can you show me
that wheelchair?

16:09.835 --> 16:11.530
Here it is.

16:12.104 --> 16:13.503
He's heading to
the annex building.

16:29.888 --> 16:33.525
He's bleeding here.
Have you seen him?

16:33.525 --> 16:34.321
No.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.857
Aren't you off today?

16:35.961 --> 16:37.394
Hey.

16:39.031 --> 16:40.833
Here's good.
Thank you.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.528
Annex Building

16:45.604 --> 16:46.536
Sorry.

16:46.805 --> 16:47.772
Annex Building

16:58.584 --> 17:00.745
Who are you?
You can't come in here.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.107
It was you at
Myungjin Building, right?

17:38.424 --> 17:39.686
I'm being followed.

17:40.526 --> 17:41.515
What?

17:41.994 --> 17:43.757
What did you just say?

17:54.373 --> 17:55.806
Let go of me.

17:57.476 --> 17:58.170
Let go.

18:07.653 --> 18:08.711
Son of a bitch.

18:10.055 --> 18:11.113
Stop!

18:11.457 --> 18:12.389
Stop!

18:56.768 --> 18:58.360
Stop right there!

20:07.206 --> 20:08.537
Can I use your phone?

20:21.753 --> 20:24.722
Tenants association and foreign funds
enter bidding war to buy Myungjin Building

20:50.015 --> 20:52.618
The surveillance tape,
the emergency log.

20:52.618 --> 20:53.719
And the patient's chart.

20:53.719 --> 20:55.084
They're all gone.

20:55.487 --> 20:56.579
What about the doctor?

20:56.888 --> 20:58.685
Name's Lee Tae-jun.
32 years old.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.554
He's a third year resident.

21:00.993 --> 21:04.485
His wife is Jung Hee-joo,
a psychiatrist at the same hospital.

21:04.963 --> 21:06.726
She's on maternity leave.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.695
Their address is the only
thing we have right now.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.369
What about Myungjin Building?

21:10.369 --> 21:14.396
The building was put up for auction
so most of the tenants moved out.

21:14.740 --> 21:17.376
Been a while since
the building had maintenance.

21:17.376 --> 21:19.310
No CCTV cameras or witnesses.

21:19.411 --> 21:20.571
Whose jurisdiction is it?

21:21.880 --> 21:23.404
The Regional lnvestigation Unit.

21:28.687 --> 21:30.120
What have you been doing?

21:32.724 --> 21:34.419
This is awkward.

21:34.526 --> 21:39.156
Senior lnspector Song
of the RlU will take over.

21:41.933 --> 21:43.059
I'm Song Kee-chul.

21:46.138 --> 21:49.369
He's the suspect on my case.
I appreciate your understanding.

21:49.474 --> 21:51.942
I need an explanation
to get any understanding.

21:52.511 --> 21:53.979
But nobody's willing to.

21:53.979 --> 21:57.049
You're in no position
to say that.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.778
Please do understand.

21:59.117 --> 22:01.086
We'd like to combine forces.

22:01.086 --> 22:04.222
But it's an order from above
to investigate undisclosed.

22:04.222 --> 22:05.824
You won't put him
on the wanted list?

22:05.824 --> 22:08.793
Didn't you hear that
it's an order from above?

22:09.161 --> 22:11.459
I'll explain it.

22:12.964 --> 22:15.194
As you know,

22:16.101 --> 22:21.039
the victim of suite 408
and the suspect had a fight.

22:21.039 --> 22:24.609
The victim shot the suspect
and the suspect ran away.

22:24.609 --> 22:28.780
The victim, of course, was
found dead in his office.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.077
And you must know

22:30.182 --> 22:32.673
that the suspect escaped
from the hospital this morning.

22:33.251 --> 22:34.786
The people above believe

22:34.786 --> 22:37.516
it'll be difficult to investigate
if the news goes public.

22:37.622 --> 22:40.921
Please keep your detectives'
mouths shut about this case.

22:47.499 --> 22:50.491
So I'll take it that
you've understood.

22:53.372 --> 22:57.274
Is RlU taking over
this case too?

22:58.076 --> 22:59.338
Let's go get him.

22:59.444 --> 23:01.813
We can't even enter
the crime scene.

23:01.813 --> 23:03.474
Are you chickening out?

23:06.685 --> 23:09.779
No, I'll do whatever
you tell me to do.

23:10.522 --> 23:12.387
Whatever.

23:31.777 --> 23:32.573
Fuck.

24:13.418 --> 24:14.646
It's all right.

24:26.731 --> 24:28.667
Myungjin Building

24:28.667 --> 24:31.761
- People, guard the entrance.
- You can't come in here.

24:32.037 --> 24:33.368
You can't come in here.

24:35.106 --> 24:37.542
We're all family, come on.

24:37.542 --> 24:38.777
This is the District Attorney's
investigation.

24:38.777 --> 24:39.945
Give us a break.

24:39.945 --> 24:41.012
I just need five minutes.

24:41.012 --> 24:44.072
I said no.

24:45.650 --> 24:46.952
Don't touch me.

24:46.952 --> 24:47.919
What?

24:47.919 --> 24:50.251
You just sneakily rubbed against me.

24:51.590 --> 24:52.824
Me?

24:52.824 --> 24:53.725
Yes, you.

24:53.725 --> 24:55.192
Apologize to her.

24:56.061 --> 24:58.763
- I didn't touch her.
- That's sexual harassment.

24:58.763 --> 24:59.821
Excuse me.

25:00.599 --> 25:01.725
Do it right.

25:02.367 --> 25:03.527
You.

25:38.103 --> 25:39.570
Hello?

25:39.671 --> 25:40.865
Put him on the phone.

25:40.939 --> 25:42.031
Pardon?

25:42.440 --> 25:46.035
I called the hospital.

25:46.478 --> 25:47.775
Said he's out.

25:48.713 --> 25:50.203
Yes.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.416
He's with me.

25:51.416 --> 25:53.577
Tae-jun, are you okay?

25:53.718 --> 25:59.418
- Tae-jun, it's me
- Hee-joo! Hee-joo!

25:59.858 --> 26:02.827
Is my Hee-joo okay?

26:02.928 --> 26:04.259
She's fine.

26:05.263 --> 26:06.560
So...

26:07.599 --> 26:09.863
So put him on the phone.

26:12.537 --> 26:14.940
He can't talk because
he's on a ventilator.

26:14.940 --> 26:17.067
Shit.

26:17.208 --> 26:18.539
Fucker.

26:18.643 --> 26:19.701
Stop.

26:19.945 --> 26:22.581
Stop.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.173
Stop it.

26:28.653 --> 26:30.883
Mister.

26:36.027 --> 26:40.487
Bring him to
the Mecenapolis Mall.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.663
We processed his fingerprints.

27:17.902 --> 27:20.962
His name is Baek Yeo-hoon,
39 years old.

27:21.106 --> 27:25.600
He was dispatched to East Timor
as Special Forces Sergeant.

27:25.744 --> 27:29.180
Also worked as a private military
contractor in Southeast Asia.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.215
A private contractor?

27:30.215 --> 27:32.150
- Send this.
- Yes.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.242
Wait a moment.

27:34.719 --> 27:38.790
Hawk Bullet is the only
private military company in Korea.

27:38.790 --> 27:41.059
After serving 1 0 years
as a contractor,

27:41.059 --> 27:43.695
three months ago
he came back to Korea.

27:43.695 --> 27:47.599
Don't send Baek's
records to RlU.

27:47.599 --> 27:48.266
Pardon?

27:48.266 --> 27:49.668
Don't send it.

27:49.668 --> 27:50.535
Yes, ma'am.

27:50.535 --> 27:52.366
Give it back.

28:02.547 --> 28:05.812
Myungjin Building
Suite 408, Mr. Jang

28:07.085 --> 28:08.484
Mr. Jang...

28:19.497 --> 28:22.364
Hope HR, Jang Pil-ju
Central HR, Jang Joong-ho

28:37.348 --> 28:39.543
You sure this is
Baek Sung-hoon's house?

28:39.884 --> 28:41.579
Mr. Jang gave me
this address.

28:51.896 --> 28:53.363
Did you hear that?

28:53.565 --> 28:54.691
Hear what?

29:08.747 --> 29:11.181
Baek Sung-hoon turned
his phone on. I got him.

29:11.649 --> 29:12.775
Let me see.

29:13.451 --> 29:14.352
He's moving.

29:14.352 --> 29:15.717
I got you now, bastard.

29:16.020 --> 29:16.987
Let's go.

29:33.004 --> 29:34.062
I'll get you a new one.

30:01.232 --> 30:02.200
Hello?

30:02.200 --> 30:03.394
Why are you alone?

30:03.501 --> 30:05.867
I told you he's in
no condition to move.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.472
Don't lie to me.
Damn!

30:07.472 --> 30:09.463
I'm not lying.
Why would I lie to you?

30:10.775 --> 30:12.174
Hello?

30:15.046 --> 30:16.343
Shit.

30:16.981 --> 30:18.141
Connection lost

30:18.283 --> 30:19.341
Hey!

30:19.918 --> 30:21.112
Hurry up.

30:41.272 --> 30:44.139
Where's my brother?
Take me to him.

30:44.742 --> 30:47.233
If he's...
If he's not there,

30:47.745 --> 30:49.406
the girl dies.

30:52.450 --> 30:53.610
Your brother?

30:53.852 --> 30:55.251
Take me there right now.

30:56.354 --> 30:57.753
Where's Hee-joo?

30:58.189 --> 30:59.588
I want to see her first.

31:09.667 --> 31:11.498
Stop right there.

31:22.914 --> 31:23.903
Stop!

32:05.556 --> 32:07.251
- Let go of me.
- No!

32:07.392 --> 32:08.192
Where's Hee-joo?

32:08.192 --> 32:09.294
Let's go see her.

32:09.294 --> 32:11.558
Fool, you'll get
us both killed.

32:11.829 --> 32:13.456
Where's Hee-joo?

32:14.699 --> 32:15.927
Where's Hee-joo?

32:17.502 --> 32:19.060
What the hell are you doing?

32:28.279 --> 32:29.143
Who are you?

32:48.866 --> 32:50.993
Where's the guy you
sneaked out of the hospital?

32:53.338 --> 32:54.805
Where is he?

32:55.039 --> 32:56.734
I really don't know.

33:01.612 --> 33:02.670
You don't know?

33:44.155 --> 33:45.349
Where's Sung-hoon?

33:46.391 --> 33:47.790
How would I know?

33:48.926 --> 33:49.756
Run!

33:53.998 --> 33:55.795
Son of a bitch!

35:34.165 --> 35:35.996
I'll drink it.

35:48.179 --> 35:50.414
It's okay.

35:50.414 --> 35:51.813
Fuck.
Fucker!

35:53.284 --> 35:58.847
Damn. Damn. Damn.
Stop. Stop!

35:59.157 --> 35:59.987
Hey!

36:00.091 --> 36:01.956
It's my fault.

36:07.965 --> 36:10.433
Damn!
Damn!

36:13.671 --> 36:16.003
Damn!
Damn!

36:16.574 --> 36:19.008
Damn!
Damn!

36:23.080 --> 36:25.844
Stop hitting yourself
and look at me.

36:27.151 --> 36:28.482
Fucker!

36:30.154 --> 36:31.314
I'm sorry.

36:31.956 --> 36:34.083
It's all right.

36:35.193 --> 36:38.560
I know this is like
sneezing for you.

36:39.330 --> 36:41.195
I know you can't hold it back.

36:42.466 --> 36:43.831
Tell me.

36:45.770 --> 36:47.533
What's wrong?

36:49.407 --> 36:51.568
Because...
Because of me...

36:53.778 --> 36:55.211
My brother...
Damn!

36:55.780 --> 37:00.080
My brother is badly hurt.

37:02.787 --> 37:05.483
He might...
He might die.

37:06.023 --> 37:07.490
You have a brother?

37:10.228 --> 37:13.527
Yes.
He's my brother.

37:15.566 --> 37:16.931
My brother...
My brother...

37:17.535 --> 37:20.333
I have a brother.

37:20.871 --> 37:22.361
It's raining!

37:22.873 --> 37:23.805
Get inside.

37:28.846 --> 37:29.513
Does it smell?

37:29.513 --> 37:33.472
When Mom did the laundry,
it always smelled good.

37:33.584 --> 37:36.712
Wow.
You remember that?

37:37.054 --> 37:39.648
How come when we do it,
it doesn't smell like that?

37:42.893 --> 37:44.155
Wait, wait, wait!

37:44.262 --> 37:45.661
Bastard.

37:46.731 --> 37:48.062
Hello, Mr. Jang.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.067
Yes, wait.

37:50.067 --> 37:50.931
Hey!

37:51.002 --> 37:52.336
Don't...
Don't hang up.

37:52.336 --> 37:54.668
Finish what you were doing.

37:56.007 --> 38:00.501
I'm always thankful for the
work you give me, sir.

38:00.845 --> 38:02.680
Come, come here.
Wipe your feet.

38:02.680 --> 38:03.704
Where?

38:04.382 --> 38:07.718
Yeongdeungpo.

38:07.718 --> 38:10.516
Go to Sung-hoon.

38:12.423 --> 38:13.481
Sung-hoon!

38:13.858 --> 38:15.587
What're you writing
so carefully?

38:15.760 --> 38:19.093
I get paid once a month.

38:19.864 --> 38:21.229
And today's payday.

38:22.033 --> 38:23.057
Want to come with me?

38:23.301 --> 38:24.869
I'll buy...
I'll buy you steak.

38:24.869 --> 38:26.700
No thanks.
It's a hassle.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.506
Let's go.

38:31.809 --> 38:32.833
You little...!

38:34.211 --> 38:35.508
You're big enough
to challenge me now?

38:38.382 --> 38:40.543
Rock-paper-scissors!
Rock-paper-scissors!

38:40.685 --> 38:42.448
All right, I won!

38:42.720 --> 38:43.880
You go get it.

38:43.988 --> 38:46.157
You always want to
order me around.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.351
I'll hold the elevator.

38:47.625 --> 38:48.626
Think about what
to eat for dinner.

38:48.626 --> 38:49.558
Okay.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.222
Suite 408, right?

38:51.329 --> 38:52.455
Yeah.

38:58.703 --> 39:00.227
Came here for the document.

39:29.767 --> 39:30.791
Yeo-hoon!

39:32.703 --> 39:33.931
Yeo-hoon!

39:40.811 --> 39:42.073
He said you're his brother.

39:42.680 --> 39:43.647
Is it true?

39:44.548 --> 39:45.640
It's true.

39:46.317 --> 39:47.477
Call him.

39:52.022 --> 39:53.922
I did.
His phone is turned off.

39:54.425 --> 39:56.052
- Then call him again.
- Get off me.

40:10.374 --> 40:11.807
Fucking asshole.

40:14.078 --> 40:14.942
Fucking asshole.

40:15.079 --> 40:17.104
What did I do wrong?
Bastard!

40:19.350 --> 40:21.011
Fucking asshole.

40:21.218 --> 40:23.982
What did we do wrong?
Fucking asshole!

40:24.555 --> 40:25.749
Asshole!

40:26.791 --> 40:28.884
Call the bastard
until he picks it up.

40:28.993 --> 40:30.824
Until he picks it up.

40:31.061 --> 40:35.464
Your retarded brother
kidnapped my wife.

40:38.502 --> 40:39.992
Don't you call him that.

41:01.759 --> 41:05.217
Those guys have been after us
since last night.

41:06.964 --> 41:08.226
Anyway, I'm sorry.

41:09.533 --> 41:13.765
My brother is on probation.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.501
I'm worried that

41:18.642 --> 41:20.041
he might have made
a mistake somewhere.

42:35.452 --> 42:36.817
Inspector Jung Young-joo

42:58.375 --> 42:59.399
Hello.

43:00.010 --> 43:01.238
This is Lee Tae-jun.

43:02.146 --> 43:03.875
My wife has been kidnapped.

43:05.282 --> 43:07.580
I need your help.

43:09.019 --> 43:11.214
I have nowhere to go.

43:12.022 --> 43:14.650
Don't worry and
wait right there.

43:17.861 --> 43:19.123
I found Baek.

43:19.296 --> 43:21.059
He's at the north side dock
ofYanghwa Bridge.

43:21.165 --> 43:22.655
Bring everyone.
Hurry!

43:35.145 --> 43:36.373
You shouldn't move yet.

43:36.447 --> 43:37.641
I don't have much time.

43:41.485 --> 43:42.782
I don't trust you.

43:43.354 --> 43:45.481
You said your brother
is on probation.

43:51.395 --> 43:52.487
Get inside.

43:57.935 --> 43:59.300
Attack me like last time!

44:02.673 --> 44:04.038
Put your hands over your head.

44:07.344 --> 44:10.142
I met the kidnapper
an hour ago, but lost him.

44:10.481 --> 44:12.073
Someone is after us.

44:13.384 --> 44:14.783
Someone is after you?

44:15.419 --> 44:16.477
Yes.

44:18.222 --> 44:19.490
Where are Detectives Kim and Oh?

44:19.490 --> 44:20.889
They're on their way now.

44:22.459 --> 44:25.257
You, little one, stay here on lookout.

44:27.064 --> 44:28.198
Who called it in?

44:28.198 --> 44:29.426
The Han River patrol.

44:29.533 --> 44:32.434
The man's description
matches the shopping mall reports.

44:32.603 --> 44:33.592
And it's close.

44:35.272 --> 44:38.639
Inspector Jung.
What're you doing here?

44:40.210 --> 44:42.075
Dr. Lee Tae-jun called in.

44:45.883 --> 44:48.283
This is the Myungjin
Building suspect.

44:49.753 --> 44:50.685
Arrest him.

44:51.989 --> 44:53.081
Hands behind you!

44:54.692 --> 44:58.628
Did you know that Baek's brother
kidnapped this man's wife?

45:01.732 --> 45:02.700
Is this true?

45:02.700 --> 45:03.928
Tell him, bastard.

45:12.009 --> 45:13.067
It's the kidnapper.

45:13.143 --> 45:14.474
Put him on the speakerphone.

45:16.246 --> 45:17.406
Hello.

45:17.514 --> 45:19.311
What happened to my brother?

45:19.550 --> 45:22.678
Your brother is safe.
What about my wife?

45:23.020 --> 45:24.487
What about my brother?

45:24.588 --> 45:26.123
Put my wife on the phone first.

45:26.123 --> 45:27.818
- Sung-hoon!
- Shut your mouth.

45:28.058 --> 45:30.327
Yeo-hoon!
Yeo-hoon!

45:30.327 --> 45:31.095
Are you okay?

45:31.095 --> 45:32.426
Sung-hoon, I'm all right!

45:33.530 --> 45:36.192
Where's Mr. Lee's wife?
Put her on the phone.

45:36.266 --> 45:37.756
We didn't...
That man...

45:38.102 --> 45:39.660
We didn't kill him.
Damn.

45:39.937 --> 45:41.165
Yeo-hoon.

45:41.605 --> 45:43.402
Say...
Say something...

45:43.540 --> 45:45.303
You also went to
Myungjin Building?

45:45.442 --> 45:46.807
Yeo-hoon.

45:47.211 --> 45:50.681
They tried to kill us.

45:50.681 --> 45:52.615
Right?

45:53.450 --> 45:55.441
Say something!

45:55.786 --> 45:56.878
Baek Sung-hoon,

45:57.254 --> 45:58.388
this is the police.

45:58.388 --> 45:59.556
If you turn yourself in,

45:59.556 --> 46:01.046
you'll be treated fairly.

46:01.158 --> 46:03.649
You, your brother, the doctor

46:03.761 --> 46:05.329
and his wife will all be fine.

46:05.329 --> 46:07.024
Tell me where you are now.

46:08.265 --> 46:09.527
Okay.

46:11.769 --> 46:12.997
Take Baek to the station.

46:13.303 --> 46:14.571
You should open
a public investigation.

46:14.571 --> 46:16.402
We'll wrap this up.

46:16.940 --> 46:20.103
It seems this investigation
is just beginning.

46:20.344 --> 46:22.513
Someone's after these two.

46:22.513 --> 46:24.081
You believe them?

46:24.081 --> 46:25.912
Did you see
the outside of the building?

46:28.318 --> 46:30.081
There was a shootout.

46:33.257 --> 46:35.316
You need to go back to
the crime scene.

46:42.833 --> 46:43.993
That's fine.

46:44.468 --> 46:46.026
Please do help with
the investigation.

46:48.639 --> 46:50.334
I'll report it to headquarters.

46:55.879 --> 46:58.211
We have Baek Sung-hoon.

47:24.374 --> 47:26.205
Fuck!

47:28.846 --> 47:30.143
What're you watching?

47:30.547 --> 47:32.606
Fucker!

47:37.254 --> 47:39.415
Stay put, fucker.
Don't move!

47:43.527 --> 47:44.585
Put on your badges.

47:45.629 --> 47:46.960
Stay still!

47:47.431 --> 47:50.161
Good job, fuckers.

47:52.703 --> 47:55.297
A cop is dead
because you messed up.

47:55.505 --> 47:56.836
I'm sorry.

47:57.074 --> 47:59.008
Look at yourselves.

48:01.678 --> 48:03.407
How do we sort out this mess?

48:19.096 --> 48:20.222
Does it hurt?

48:20.364 --> 48:22.594
No, sir.

48:23.734 --> 48:25.565
Let's say that
you were injured here.

48:27.471 --> 48:28.768
Yes, sir.

48:31.608 --> 48:33.769
If no one got hurt,
it'd be boring.

48:52.696 --> 48:55.426
So we were fighting these two...

48:58.201 --> 48:59.293
Chief!

48:59.803 --> 49:01.100
Let us sort this out.

49:01.204 --> 49:02.899
Don't forget
the investigation procedure.

49:03.006 --> 49:04.098
Let go!

49:07.678 --> 49:09.976
You're breaking
my concentration.

49:12.983 --> 49:16.248
I guess you could say it's unfair.

49:17.454 --> 49:18.614
Then you guys do it.

49:19.890 --> 49:24.190
So you fought with them
and killed them.

49:31.368 --> 49:32.733
Look at this feisty thing.

49:45.882 --> 49:47.372
Let's go write more scripts.

49:48.118 --> 49:49.380
Hurry!

49:54.224 --> 49:55.418
Wrap it up here.

49:56.927 --> 49:58.292
Where's Baek Sung-hoon?

50:02.199 --> 50:03.033
Chief.

50:03.033 --> 50:05.058
Detectives Oh and Kim
just went inside.

50:29.760 --> 50:32.024
Jang Pil-ju, you fucker!

50:33.797 --> 50:35.198
You're gonna pop my eardrum.

50:35.198 --> 50:36.324
What?

50:36.533 --> 50:38.364
Please talk quietly.

50:38.468 --> 50:40.070
How can l?

50:40.070 --> 50:42.129
Everything's completely fucked up!

50:42.239 --> 50:44.764
I'm in no better condition.

50:45.242 --> 50:49.702
I'm busy trying to calm down
the pissed-off moneybags.

50:49.846 --> 50:52.781
He didn't do anything.
Why is the fucker pissed off?

50:52.983 --> 50:54.109
I did everything.

50:56.486 --> 50:58.755
You know I'm getting half
the shares for this case.

50:58.755 --> 51:04.387
You know that you'll get paid
when the police close the case.

51:04.594 --> 51:07.757
Fucker, I'm the police!
I told you I'd finish it.

51:08.165 --> 51:09.462
Sure.

51:09.833 --> 51:11.858
You're right.

51:12.302 --> 51:14.566
You'd better take care
of the wire transfer.

51:18.341 --> 51:21.211
Fucker, are you going
to stop at every stop light?

51:21.211 --> 51:22.269
Sorry, sir.

51:24.648 --> 51:26.115
Fuck.

51:28.085 --> 51:29.279
Bastard.

51:54.978 --> 51:56.070
Search his pockets.

51:59.649 --> 52:00.809
It's smashed.

52:03.086 --> 52:04.280
Where did they go?

52:04.955 --> 52:06.115
I don't know.

52:10.527 --> 52:11.858
Where did they go?

52:13.396 --> 52:15.330
Near a park in Mangu-dong.

52:22.305 --> 52:25.570
You two are screwed now.

52:25.809 --> 52:27.208
Shoot me.
Come on!

52:28.111 --> 52:31.410
Do you want to be
a real murderer?

52:33.617 --> 52:34.641
We need to go.

52:53.637 --> 52:54.934
Chief...

53:00.076 --> 53:01.270
Soo-jin.

53:03.446 --> 53:05.641
Park Soo-jin!
Snap out of it!

53:18.061 --> 53:19.858
Call the ambulance.

53:20.263 --> 53:22.060
Hurry up, bastards.

53:29.039 --> 53:30.904
Stop, fuckers!

53:31.541 --> 53:32.735
Stop!

53:46.690 --> 53:47.782
I'm sorry about this.

53:48.158 --> 53:50.285
Hurry, we have to get there first.

53:56.099 --> 53:58.033
I'm in pursuit of the murder
suspect of a police officer.

53:58.668 --> 54:00.465
The suspect's license plate is 5987.

54:00.670 --> 54:03.605
They're heading toward Mangu-dong
from north of the Yanghwa Bridge.

54:05.175 --> 54:06.506
Repeat.

54:11.648 --> 54:13.673
I'm in pursuit
of the murder suspect.

54:48.385 --> 54:49.249
Hit the gas!

55:08.738 --> 55:09.705
Hit it!

55:52.949 --> 55:54.541
Everything's going
to be okay.

55:57.287 --> 56:01.246
I did something really stupid.

56:02.992 --> 56:05.722
It's good that you've realized this.

56:08.765 --> 56:10.392
I'm...
I'm sorry.

56:12.469 --> 56:16.166
I was reunited with
my brother after 1 0 years.

56:17.340 --> 56:21.333
I was scared to part
from him again.

56:21.711 --> 56:25.841
When I find my brother, damn!

56:26.850 --> 56:28.283
I'll turn myself in.

56:40.764 --> 56:42.493
You stupid fuck!

56:42.599 --> 56:43.588
Bye.

56:45.201 --> 56:46.395
What's wrong?

56:50.140 --> 56:52.040
They lost those two.

56:52.776 --> 56:54.437
You take the girl away.

56:55.145 --> 56:56.203
Let's smile.

57:01.351 --> 57:02.511
Are you all right?

57:04.487 --> 57:07.149
Is my husband okay?

57:07.257 --> 57:10.283
Your husband is fine.
Please follow this detective.

57:13.163 --> 57:14.755
What?
What's wrong?

57:16.099 --> 57:18.226
- Careful.
- Please come this way.

57:20.403 --> 57:23.236
Where are you going?
We need to talk.

57:33.316 --> 57:34.305
You sit over here.

57:34.784 --> 57:36.581
You keep a lookout.

57:37.420 --> 57:39.354
Are you going to leave
without saluting?

57:41.191 --> 57:42.385
Sit down.

57:46.329 --> 57:48.388
What's wrong?

57:48.932 --> 57:52.868
Is it so hard to bring
one piece of paper?

57:53.203 --> 57:55.905
Why did you have to
bring you brother in there?

57:55.905 --> 57:58.931
I ordered you to do it, fucker.

57:59.909 --> 58:01.678
Please let me see my brother.

58:01.678 --> 58:03.413
Sit down and don't move.

58:03.413 --> 58:05.210
Look at me.

58:08.251 --> 58:10.082
I looked. Fuck!

58:12.222 --> 58:13.314
Fuck?

58:15.024 --> 58:16.150
Bastard says fuck.

58:39.582 --> 58:40.412
Sung-hoon!

58:42.252 --> 58:43.241
Hee-joo.

58:49.993 --> 58:51.517
- Sung-hoon!
- Hee-joo!

58:51.828 --> 58:52.886
Hee-joo!

59:03.306 --> 59:04.330
Sung-hoon...

59:14.317 --> 59:15.443
Wait!

59:17.987 --> 59:19.887
We need to take him
to the hospital right away.

59:20.957 --> 59:21.889
Sung-hoon!

59:22.358 --> 59:23.256
Yeo-hoon.

59:23.459 --> 59:26.485
Hey, I'm here.
You'll be all right.

59:27.564 --> 59:28.895
They...

59:31.534 --> 59:33.024
They took her...

59:36.739 --> 59:37.967
To me...

59:38.207 --> 59:39.504
She was...

59:42.512 --> 59:43.846
She was good to me.

59:43.846 --> 59:44.938
Okay.

59:45.882 --> 59:48.350
I'm so sorry.
How can I make it up to you?

59:49.485 --> 59:50.611
You...

59:53.056 --> 59:54.717
You save her.

59:55.258 --> 59:56.247
Okay.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.800
She reminded me...

01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:12.132
Reminded me of your wife.

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:16.106
I...

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:20.748
With you...

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:25.688
Fried chicken.

01:00:25.688 --> 01:00:29.522
I wanted to open a fried
chicken restaurant with you.

01:00:31.227 --> 01:00:32.558
Let's do that.

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:37.400
Yeo-hoon?
What is it?

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.867
Sung-hoon.

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:48.939
Sung-hoon?

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:39.859
This place was Sung-hoon's hideout
since he was a kid.

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:43.160
After kids bullied him,

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.866
he'd wait here until I came.

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:51.566
How could this happen?

01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:54.266
This is unbelievable.

01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:04.911
I need to find out

01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:08.756
why they killed Sung-hoon,

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:12.593
and why they took your wife.

01:02:15.098 --> 01:02:17.430
You have no more
reason to help me.

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:20.101
If I don't,
Sung-hoon will forever be

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:22.501
known as the kidnapper
of a pregnant woman.

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:25.371
What do we do now?

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:31.838
Let's find your wife.

01:02:36.385 --> 01:02:37.647
And that bastard.

01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:42.150
I'll kill him no matter
what it takes.

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:13.912
Are you Jang Jin-sung?

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:16.089
That's right.

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:26.966
Sung-hoon tried so hard
to get a decent job.

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:34.905
Do you recognize
either of these names?

01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:36.379
Jang Pil-ju?

01:03:36.379 --> 01:03:38.677
I don't know Jang Joong-ho,
but I know this guy.

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:41.773
Sung-hoon met up with him often.
He came by my shop several times.

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:45.054
What does he do?

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:49.286
He was a mysterious person.
He changed cars often.

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:52.328
He often sent Sung-hoon
to run his errands.

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:55.229
Like delivering stuff and driving.

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:01.627
Wait here.

01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:04.133
I'll go with you.

01:04:06.108 --> 01:04:09.339
If something happens to me,
you at least should stay alive.

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:13.849
One of us needs to stay alive
so he can't hurt your wife.

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:16.448
But let me help somehow.

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:36.468
Hope HR Recruitment

01:04:36.739 --> 01:04:38.263
Wow, it's brand new.

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:39.876
Is Mr. Jang in?

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:42.037
- Of course he is.
- Let's go.

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:47.049
It's fucking hard.
If I had a gun, I'd shoot it.

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:48.107
I know.

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:49.985
Who is that?

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:51.086
Wait a sec.

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:53.113
Did you come for work?

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:54.712
Come back tomorrow morning.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.222
Look at this fucker.

01:04:57.026 --> 01:04:59.756
- Why did you lock the door?
- Why did you do that?

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:00.963
Don't talk down to me.

01:05:00.963 --> 01:05:02.726
Look at this bitch.

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:07.603
Son of a bitch!

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:21.648
What is it?

01:05:29.725 --> 01:05:30.692
Fuck!

01:05:40.836 --> 01:05:41.860
What the hell?

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:39.992
Where's Jang Pil-ju?

01:06:42.064 --> 01:06:43.326
Top floor...

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:50.271
That feels good.

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:54.571
I love Thailand!

01:06:56.112 --> 01:06:58.239
Harder!

01:07:00.182 --> 01:07:02.150
What the hell?

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:12.454
Jang Pil-ju

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:15.264
Who the fuck are you?

01:07:15.264 --> 01:07:16.822
I'm gonna kill you!

01:07:38.654 --> 01:07:41.384
Did you make Sung-hoon
run your errands?

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:42.751
Yes.

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:46.751
Who is that police officer?

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:51.023
Senior lnspector Song of the RlU.

01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:03.402
Who?

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:06.413
The Regional lnvestigation Unit.
Song Kee-chul.

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:08.049
Who is he?

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:10.118
He works as a contractor.

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:12.119
- A contract killer?
- Yes.

01:08:12.888 --> 01:08:16.448
What were you going
to do with Sung-hoon?

01:08:17.693 --> 01:08:18.794
An extra.

01:08:18.794 --> 01:08:20.022
Elaborate.

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:22.756
He was the extra.

01:08:23.131 --> 01:08:26.363
It's supposed to look like the victim
killed the extra in self-defense.

01:08:26.801 --> 01:08:31.671
Then we pin everything
on the extra.

01:08:33.408 --> 01:08:35.001
Why'd you pick Sung-hoon?

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.502
According to files he's an orphan.

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.283
Please don't kill me.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.501
Bring me

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:15.682
the leash you have on him.

01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:17.077
What?

01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:21.118
You must have
an account book or something.

01:09:23.591 --> 01:09:25.354
There's no such thing.

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:32.295
Wait!

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:38.298
That's my life insurance.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:41.371
Then it's time to cash in
that insurance.

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:43.874
Don't kill me.
It's in there.

01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:46.714
I'll use it right now.

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:48.308
It's over there.

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:18.176
No one can stop that
money-grubbing scumbag, Song.

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:22.442
The man who bankrupted
a $20 million building

01:10:23.018 --> 01:10:25.221
and made it worthless
after 6 failed biddings.

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:27.382
It was the work of Yang.

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:32.688
But Yang's partner who wanted it all
for himself paid us to kill Yang.

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:39.592
Song took the case and
was promised half the take.

01:10:40.502 --> 01:10:44.836
Which means if Yang dies,
Song gets $10 million.

01:10:45.474 --> 01:10:47.669
We need an orphan
for the extra.

01:10:50.879 --> 01:10:52.437
Why an orphan?

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:56.552
So there're no bereaved family
or lawyer involved, stupid.

01:10:56.552 --> 01:10:59.851
He'd kill his own
parents for money.

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:02.688
That's why I need
a safety valve,

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:04.850
or I'm through.

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:07.827
His team is filled
with his detectives.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:11.260
He's made so much
money in the past 5 years...

01:11:11.634 --> 01:11:14.228
Piss him off,
and he kills you instantly.

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:16.465
I thought Baek Sung-hoon
was an orphan.

01:11:17.706 --> 01:11:21.335
His parents got divorced
when he was young.

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:24.772
Nowadays, that type of information
doesn't appear on the family registry.

01:11:29.718 --> 01:11:31.948
Is this how you
handle a situation?

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.646
I'll find him.

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:38.417
When?

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:41.621
Soon, I guess.

01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:46.132
I guess?

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:49.334
- I guess?
- I'll find him.

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:54.674
If we don't find him
by tonight, we're through.

01:11:56.612 --> 01:11:58.170
Can't you see outside?

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:04.350
A DA's investigation has been
turned into a special investigation.

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:10.989
Gather the reporters.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:13.693
What're you going to do?

01:12:17.733 --> 01:12:19.360
If we can't find them,

01:12:20.769 --> 01:12:22.634
we'll get them to come here.

01:12:31.814 --> 01:12:36.114
The police are looking for
Lee Tae-jun and Baek Yeo-hoon,

01:12:36.418 --> 01:12:39.251
Hey. It's on the news.

01:12:39.388 --> 01:12:41.879
the suspects ofYang and
lnspector Jung's murders.

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:45.687
Meanwhile, Baek Sung-hoon,
who was found dead in a park

01:12:45.794 --> 01:12:50.424
turned out to have kidnapped
Lee Tae-jun's wife this morning.

01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:54.169
The police found Baek Yeo-hoon's
fingerprints on the dead.

01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:57.627
Baek Yeo-hoon is also
suspected in this case.

01:12:58.407 --> 01:13:03.936
We're questioning
Lee's wife as a witness

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:09.382
while searchin
for the two suspects.

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:12.921
The Regional lnvestigation Unit
has formed a special task force...

01:13:13.088 --> 01:13:14.953
Jung Young-joo

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:18.084
Why'd you bring that here?

01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:20.154
I'm not ready to let her go.

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:25.624
Why is that area controlled?

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:29.705
They say RlU is in charge of
the witnesses for now.

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:31.366
What a bunch of weirdos.

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:33.436
Who do they think they are?
The FBl?

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:35.232
Watch out for the ash.

01:13:37.813 --> 01:13:38.780
Detective Park.

01:13:43.786 --> 01:13:44.946
Hello.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.719
This is Lee Tae-jun.

01:14:02.504 --> 01:14:03.903
How long has it been
since he left?

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:06.336
About 50 minutes.

01:14:06.642 --> 01:14:07.802
You should've stopped him.

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:14.005
He walked out on his own.
How can I stop him?

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:18.183
I can't hand over the evidence
to the police now.

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:30.257
You expect me to believe that story?

01:14:30.365 --> 01:14:31.332
It's the truth.

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:34.069
Then you should tell everyone.
Why do it like this?

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:36.629
Once the truth is revealed,
he'll hurt my wife.

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:38.140
You fucking asshole!

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.471
I have proof.

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:43.440
Inspector Jung's voice recorder.

01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:47.007
I saw the red light
flashing on it.

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:49.076
That is in...

01:14:50.953 --> 01:14:52.147
Step outside.

01:14:53.522 --> 01:14:54.887
I'd like to sit in.

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:57.856
I understand how you feel,
but I'll do it.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.928
- Chief.
- Didn't you hear me?

01:15:05.133 --> 01:15:06.191
Get out right now!

01:15:07.035 --> 01:15:08.127
Let go.

01:15:32.227 --> 01:15:33.353
Oh that?

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:38.797
Government officers get off work early.

01:15:39.601 --> 01:15:41.466
We're the only ones
in this room.

01:15:46.008 --> 01:15:48.499
You think you can cover up

01:15:48.944 --> 01:15:51.572
anything I say to the police.

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:59.048
But no matter how hard
you try to cover it up...

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:04.783
Now, show me your cards.

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:09.352
You walked in here
to save your wife.

01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:13.261
You must've
brought something.

01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:15.399
No?

01:16:16.204 --> 01:16:17.603
Of course I did.

01:16:19.374 --> 01:16:21.069
Look at this fool.

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:27.780
If you don't tell me
where Baek is,

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:30.944
you're dead.

01:16:35.557 --> 01:16:38.287
There's an army
of cops out there.

01:16:39.828 --> 01:16:41.261
Can you shoot?

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:05.409
What're you doing?

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:07.922
This is Baek Yeo-hoon.

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:09.986
If you lay a finger on
Lee Tae-jun and his wife.

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:12.526
You'll see the rest
of the photos on TV.

01:17:12.995 --> 01:17:16.556
What do you want?

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:18.394
Your head on a platter.

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:19.524
Really?

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:22.434
Where should we meet?

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:24.205
I'll come to you.

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:28.668
Okay, come and get me.

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:36.110
Listen well.

01:17:37.886 --> 01:17:40.980
I'm about to send out
all the other detectives.

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:43.548
I'll kill you soon,

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:45.960
and your wife too.

01:18:06.114 --> 01:18:07.877
Did you see
the outside of the building?

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:09.777
There was a shootout.

01:18:11.386 --> 01:18:13.320
You need to go back to
the crime scene.

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:14.887
That's fine.

01:18:15.223 --> 01:18:16.622
Please do help
with the investigation.

01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:18.655
I'll report it to headquarters.

01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:21.555
We have Baek Sung-hoon.

01:18:26.902 --> 01:18:29.598
A cop is dead
because you messed up.

01:18:29.905 --> 01:18:31.202
I'm sorry.

01:18:31.339 --> 01:18:33.569
Look at yourselves.

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:50.488
We have Baek Yeo-hoon's
whereabouts. Let's go.

01:18:50.826 --> 01:18:51.493
Where?

01:18:51.493 --> 01:18:52.960
In Gimpo. Orders to be
present in full force.

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:54.585
Let's hurry.
Let's go.

01:18:54.963 --> 01:18:56.430
I have to find Lee Tae-jun's wife.

01:18:56.732 --> 01:18:57.790
You go first.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.626
Hey.

01:19:20.522 --> 01:19:23.150
Are you coming or not?

01:19:25.994 --> 01:19:28.792
Fuck, I need to go home.

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:37.905
Are you really detectives?

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:39.571
Of course we are.

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:41.174
Detectives who write scripts.

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:46.338
And according to them,
you die here.

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:24.451
An RlU vehicle has exploded.

01:20:24.586 --> 01:20:26.076
Rear group,
return to the station.

01:20:26.454 --> 01:20:28.718
Hey, turn around.
Hurry!

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:34.294
Baek Yeo-hoon blew up my car.

01:20:35.964 --> 01:20:37.090
Detective Lee!

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:38.922
Yes, sir.

01:20:40.168 --> 01:20:41.069
What're you doing?

01:20:41.069 --> 01:20:43.060
Over here.

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:44.472
Did you take care
of Lee Tae-jun?

01:20:44.472 --> 01:20:45.962
Lee Tae-jun is...

01:20:46.074 --> 01:20:47.871
- Pull yourself together, fucker.
- Yes, sir.

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:49.840
Baek Yeo-hoon is here.

01:20:49.978 --> 01:20:52.003
And he's calling in all the cops.

01:20:53.148 --> 01:20:54.115
What's that?

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.214
I've closed the metal gate.

01:21:09.631 --> 01:21:10.859
What's that?

01:21:14.502 --> 01:21:15.867
That lunatic.

01:22:09.824 --> 01:22:10.859
Where's your wife?

01:22:10.859 --> 01:22:11.917
Go.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.094
Find her.

01:22:13.094 --> 01:22:14.186
What about you?

01:22:24.873 --> 01:22:25.703
Go!

01:22:29.177 --> 01:22:31.111
Look at this bitch.

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:46.617
So you want war...

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:05.176
What's this?

01:23:05.447 --> 01:23:06.846
Isn't this Senior lnspector Song?

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:11.479
Yes, that's him.

01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:15.319
That son of a bitch.

01:24:00.268 --> 01:24:01.394
Shit.

01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:12.742
So the fucker wants to challenge
governmental authority?

01:24:19.687 --> 01:24:20.676
Son of a bitch!

01:24:58.526 --> 01:24:59.322
Hee-joo...

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:00.659
Hee-joo!

01:25:01.129 --> 01:25:03.689
Hee-joo!

01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:06.764
Hee-joo!

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:08.695
Tae-jun.

01:25:20.748 --> 01:25:21.646
Hee-joo...

01:25:23.918 --> 01:25:24.714
Hee-joo!

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:40.362
Are you okay?
Hee-joo.

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:43.069
Hee-joo.

01:25:55.116 --> 01:25:56.174
Let him go.

01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:49.267
Son of a bitch!

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:52.138
Come out!

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:56.836
Come out.

01:26:57.579 --> 01:27:00.047
Be gutsy and come out
like you did earlier, fucker!

01:27:02.984 --> 01:27:05.214
Did you see your
brother at the park?

01:27:06.521 --> 01:27:11.356
You brothers are fucking
good at hiding.

01:27:14.162 --> 01:27:15.288
Uh oh.

01:27:17.599 --> 01:27:18.964
I'm all out of bullets.

01:27:22.170 --> 01:27:24.104
This is your chance
to come out.

01:27:24.772 --> 01:27:27.366
This is your last chance.

01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:57.062
I got you now, bitch.

01:27:57.472 --> 01:27:58.530
Does it hurt?

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:01.300
Where are they?

01:28:03.411 --> 01:28:04.844
Where are they?

01:28:06.481 --> 01:28:08.039
Where are the photos?

01:28:08.549 --> 01:28:10.847
In my stomach, asshole.

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:13.948
Cut it open
and take them out.

01:28:23.564 --> 01:28:26.590
If it hurts, just scream.

01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:28.532
I'll let you live.

01:28:31.339 --> 01:28:33.136
Let's be honest.

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:37.134
The ones who died
were gonna die anyway.

01:28:37.512 --> 01:28:39.139
The thing about emotion is...

01:28:40.782 --> 01:28:42.807
it only lasts a moment.

01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:45.280
Do you think

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:49.357
this will bring your
stuttering brother back to life?

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:51.416
Fucker.

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:00.294
Come on!

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:03.462
Kill me if you can, asshole.

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:08.409
Plan your life script, fucker!

01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:13.806
I'm not much of a writer.

01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:16.207
Shoot me!

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:19.646
Shoot me, asshole.

01:29:20.588 --> 01:29:22.715
Inspector Song!

01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:24.948
Open the gate!

01:29:25.426 --> 01:29:27.485
This won't work.
Bring the equipment. Hurry!

01:31:39.093 --> 01:31:41.295
- Go easy, fuckers.
- Let me go.

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:43.564
- I'll kill that bastard.
- It hurts!

01:31:43.564 --> 01:31:44.656
Let go!

01:32:15.496 --> 01:32:19.227
4 years later

01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:31.627
Max!

01:33:31.973 --> 01:33:32.837
Daddy!

01:33:32.974 --> 01:33:35.067
Hi, Ga-eun.
Did you wake up?

01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:41.103
Look.

01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:43.542
That's Uncle Yeo-hoon.

01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:44.952
Say, Uncle Yeo-hoon.

01:33:44.952 --> 01:33:47.079
Hello, Uncle Yeo-hoon.

01:33:47.655 --> 01:33:48.522
Louder.

01:33:48.522 --> 01:33:50.319
Hello, Uncle Yeo-hoon!

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:53.586
Baby, it's cold.

01:33:54.161 --> 01:33:55.185
It's cold.

01:33:56.305 --> 01:34:02.169
