[door locks rattling]

03:17.588 --> 03:21.244
[helicopter engine roaring]

03:32.864 --> 03:34.605
- Hey, what's up man,

03:36.041 --> 03:38.609
I hate to be that guy.

03:38.653 --> 03:41.482
I was the fool who did not pick
up smokes

03:41.525 --> 03:42.309
on my way home from work,

03:42.352 --> 03:43.788
would you mind if I...

03:43.832 --> 03:47.705
[helicopter engine roaring in a
distance]

03:47.749 --> 03:48.619
My contribution.

03:52.406 --> 03:54.277
- What is that the hope diamond.

03:54.321 --> 03:55.365
- I think it is an ashtray.

03:57.411 --> 03:58.455
- You just moved in?

03:59.674 --> 04:01.763
- Yeah, like three or four
hours ago.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.027
I'm leaving the city soon,

04:05.070 --> 04:08.552
so I just basically packed up
all shit my at my old place.

04:08.596 --> 04:11.729
Sold it off there, found this
place.

04:11.773 --> 04:15.211
No lease, snatched it
up online, sight unseen.

04:16.734 --> 04:17.996
How long have you been here?

04:21.130 --> 04:25.265
- I have an ex-husband
hence just started smoking.

04:27.876 --> 04:31.488
About a decade, which I guess
makes me

04:31.532 --> 04:33.882
the de facto ambassador
to the new tenants.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.666
- Does your ceiling have any
leaks?

04:36.537 --> 04:38.103
- Ruin any of your stuff?

04:38.147 --> 04:39.017
- Nothing to ruin.

04:40.367 --> 04:43.065
- Well my ex actually
left a bunch of stuff

04:43.108 --> 04:45.285
in the garage that I
was just gonna donate.

04:45.328 --> 04:46.808
If you want to have it for some
temporary

04:46.851 --> 04:49.201
like furnishings and stuff.

04:50.551 --> 04:51.813
- Dude, that is really kind of
you.

04:51.856 --> 04:53.858
And I will actually take you up
on that.

04:54.816 --> 04:57.427
I would say let's just do it
now,

04:57.471 --> 05:00.517
but you directly ahead
off the surgery doctor.

05:00.561 --> 05:04.216
- Yeah, I'm a wedding
photographer

05:04.260 --> 05:06.306
and I just fell asleep

05:06.349 --> 05:08.438
and might get up right
after the reception.

05:08.482 --> 05:13.574
There's this kind of Autumnal
equinox goth wedding.

05:13.617 --> 05:14.662
The thing is awesome about LA

05:14.705 --> 05:16.272
is there still is huge goth
scene.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.667
So they we're just slinging
around cocktails all night

05:19.710 --> 05:22.147
but started with blood and I
got hit.

05:22.191 --> 05:23.627
- I'm about to blow your mind.

05:24.672 --> 05:26.804
The bar I work at last night is
like

05:26.848 --> 05:31.940
the dark wave electro goth.

05:31.983 --> 05:33.028
I think, I dunno it looks like

05:33.071 --> 05:34.159
so like the Renaissance Fair to
me,

05:34.203 --> 05:35.465
but I was wondering why I was
getting

05:35.509 --> 05:38.076
more bloodtinis spilled
all over me than usual.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.861
And now I know,

05:39.904 --> 05:41.253
it is the, what'd you say?

05:41.297 --> 05:42.864
It was the autumn-in-al...

05:42.907 --> 05:44.256
- Autumnal. Autumnal equinox.

05:44.300 --> 05:48.348
[helicopter engine roaring]

05:48.391 --> 05:49.566
- Its when the weeds turn brown

05:49.610 --> 05:50.872
and the hills burn and
everything smells

05:50.915 --> 05:53.396
like barbecue all the
time, it's beautiful.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.311
- Oh shit. Check this out.

05:56.138 --> 05:57.966
Last night up on that hillside.

05:59.489 --> 06:00.403
I saw this guy.

06:04.146 --> 06:07.367
- LA is like Halloween,
but just all the time.

06:09.760 --> 06:10.587
Is that your new place?

06:11.980 --> 06:14.722
- Yeah, that's it.

06:14.765 --> 06:17.159
That's my temporary digs.

06:18.334 --> 06:20.118
- It's actually been
vacant since I moved in.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.772
So it's kinda nice

06:21.816 --> 06:24.514
to have somebody watching out
over us over the neighborhood.

06:24.558 --> 06:27.169
It's getting worse. Vagrants.

06:27.212 --> 06:29.824
- It's been vacant for over a
decade?

06:29.867 --> 06:32.174
Someone like murdered there or
something?

06:33.088 --> 06:34.045
Well that's supposed to have
something

06:34.089 --> 06:34.872
disclosed to me, what's up?

06:34.916 --> 06:36.439
- Actually, yeah.

06:36.483 --> 06:37.875
A 90-year old grandma just
threw grandpa out of a window

06:37.919 --> 06:40.356
and he fell face first,
right where you're standing.

06:41.923 --> 06:45.405
[airplane engine roaring]

06:46.667 --> 06:48.843
- At least we are cheap
right to the airport.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.282
- There is this

06:53.325 --> 06:56.024
dude sits at my bar and
he always says this thing.

06:56.067 --> 06:58.461
He says, "Hey, it can only fall
so fast."

06:59.810 --> 07:01.682
[John chuckling]

07:01.725 --> 07:03.684
I hope what that dude said
to me is going fast enough

07:03.727 --> 07:04.902
to not feel the impact.

07:10.081 --> 07:10.952
- Oh no, I made that up.

07:10.995 --> 07:12.388
No one died. I was just kidding.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.564
Anyways. I got to get these bad
boys.

07:15.739 --> 07:16.740
Motor checked and charged
before church.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.481
So why don't you just swing on
by

07:18.525 --> 07:21.702
when you want to move in your
stuff.

07:21.745 --> 07:25.662
- Oh, here I go, bad neighbor,
I am John.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.930
- Oh, Levi. All right.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.366
Hey, thank you for this.

07:35.890 --> 07:38.545
- Check it out. That's hungry
Dave.

07:40.198 --> 07:41.286
He is really aggressive.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.940
Don't let him get to eye level.
Okay?

07:44.638 --> 07:47.423
[wind whistling]

08:00.044 --> 08:03.395
[bells tingling gently]

08:04.571 --> 08:07.182
[static noise]

08:19.237 --> 08:22.110
[ominous music]

08:22.153 --> 08:23.546
- What do I think went wrong,

08:25.243 --> 08:27.550
either one of two things
happened.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.770
Either they were trying to put
together

08:30.771 --> 08:33.904
this really intricate,
beautiful cosmic puzzle.

08:33.948 --> 08:36.124
And some of those pieces
were extraordinary

08:37.647 --> 08:41.956
or the way they jammed them
together.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.566
It just created this abstract
mess

08:43.610 --> 08:45.350
that then they could imbue

08:45.394 --> 08:46.743
with whatever meaning they
wanted.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.049
It doesn't really matter

08:48.092 --> 08:51.574
because it affected them
in very different ways.

08:51.618 --> 08:55.186
And I don't think anything
is worth what happened.

08:55.230 --> 08:57.362
I still believe part of it was
real.

08:57.406 --> 08:59.451
You can catch it in scientific
terms,

08:59.495 --> 09:03.064
it doesn't really matter
because the result is the same.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.501
And it's really sad.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.199
[ominous music]

09:09.897 --> 09:12.116
I don't just mean the dead one.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.902
- And there is this yellow tail,

09:14.945 --> 09:18.427
but between me and it's like

09:18.470 --> 09:21.082
this little like cavernous
that has some eel grass on it.

09:21.125 --> 09:24.085
- And it's like 19th century
lobster trap

09:24.128 --> 09:25.826
that just busted out of it,
right?

09:26.696 --> 09:28.872
And then... boom.

09:28.916 --> 09:31.919
I looked down, there's a
fucking claw around my arm.

09:31.962 --> 09:33.573
I look up, there's a lobster

09:33.616 --> 09:35.923
the size of Danny fucking
DeVito.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.359
I kid you not.

09:37.402 --> 09:38.708
And he's dragging me

09:38.752 --> 09:39.796
and I'm so fascinated

09:39.840 --> 09:41.363
but then I look in it's eyes

09:41.406 --> 09:44.453
that I almost forget I'm loaded

09:44.496 --> 09:45.889
and I can shoot left-handed.

09:47.325 --> 09:52.504
Just take aim and shtoonk,
spear the shit out of it.

09:52.548 --> 09:53.810
Barely phases it.

09:53.854 --> 09:57.074
Just kind of saunters
off back into its cave.

09:57.118 --> 09:59.599
I've never seen that lobster
again.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.252
I never saw that spear again.

10:01.296 --> 10:02.863
I didn't get that big ass tuna,

10:02.906 --> 10:05.256
but that was the day I
learned that it's like,

10:05.300 --> 10:07.258
yeah, there's a lot of good
sushi places in Los Angeles,

10:07.302 --> 10:08.825
but I don't fuck with lobster
rolls.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.306
Lobsters are intelligent
creatures.

10:11.349 --> 10:13.177
- You can hop on my wifi
network if you want to.

10:13.221 --> 10:15.049
- My signal is shockingly good
here,

10:15.092 --> 10:17.355
but I might take you up on that.

10:17.399 --> 10:18.792
What is your network?

10:18.835 --> 10:20.576
- It's "Behold the promised LAN"

10:20.620 --> 10:24.145
like L-A-N, it used to be
Mr. Rogers neighborhertz,

10:24.188 --> 10:26.060
but that was Lonnie's.

10:26.103 --> 10:27.496
It is not even clever.

10:27.539 --> 10:28.628
Oh, the password is easy to
remember.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.368
It's "JUDGEMENT DAY" all caps.

10:30.412 --> 10:33.023
- There's like a billion
fucking networks.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.938
So I'm gonna have to mess with
this later.

10:34.982 --> 10:37.288
But now I actually have to
get to this charity thing

10:37.332 --> 10:40.074
I do at the youth shelter.

10:40.117 --> 10:41.423
Can I grab you something for
the way out?

10:41.466 --> 10:42.642
Like a beer or something?

10:42.685 --> 10:44.339
I really appreciate all this.

10:44.382 --> 10:45.166
- No, thank you.

10:45.209 --> 10:46.254
Actually, I don't drink.

10:48.735 --> 10:49.779
- Good for you, bro.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.259
How long have you been sober?

10:52.564 --> 10:54.566
- Now 10 years, honestly,
Lonnie was an AA.

10:54.610 --> 10:57.526
So that kinda made me an AA,
but never even had a problem.

10:57.569 --> 11:00.660
I just kinda got way into it.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.705
Stuck with it. I don't know.

11:02.749 --> 11:03.575
- Okay, cool.

11:04.707 --> 11:05.708
Don't forget your plant, on the
way out.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.101
- Oh no, no that's yours.

11:07.144 --> 11:08.189
That's actually a house warming
gift.

11:08.232 --> 11:10.626
My grandma runs this little
nursery

11:10.670 --> 11:11.671
up in the central valley.

11:11.714 --> 11:12.672
I give her a hand with
sometimes.

11:13.760 --> 11:14.761
[phone ringing]

11:14.804 --> 11:16.371
Speak of the angel.

11:16.414 --> 11:18.895
- [John] Hey actually, do you
mind if I take this up here.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.854
- Disappears in the courtyard.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.072
- And do what you gotta do.

11:23.770 --> 11:24.640
- Hey grandma.

11:28.122 --> 11:29.297
I could probably just head on up

11:29.340 --> 11:30.690
there next Sunday, like usual,
you know.

11:33.040 --> 11:37.131
Yeah. I of course will groom
myself and wear a suit.

11:37.174 --> 11:39.133
Not just for God, but for you.

11:39.176 --> 11:42.266
All right, amen to that.

11:42.310 --> 11:45.269
All right, may you go. I love
you. Bye.

11:48.142 --> 11:51.841
She's out of her mind, man. See
you.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.975
- Can I interest you in?

11:55.018 --> 11:55.889
One for the road.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.154
- Yeah. Thank you.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.734
[soft wind whistling]

12:31.663 --> 12:34.318
[ominous music]

12:40.020 --> 12:42.762
[wind whistling]

12:47.897 --> 12:50.595
- Did you forget something?

12:50.639 --> 12:53.642
- You should just come and see
this.

12:59.126 --> 13:01.781
[ominous music]

13:13.793 --> 13:17.057
- It was moving on its own

13:17.100 --> 13:19.059
or something invisible was
moving it.

13:20.234 --> 13:21.409
There was a this light.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.416
- Yeah, no, absolutely.

13:28.459 --> 13:32.550
No doubt. I feel bad about this,

13:32.594 --> 13:35.902
I actually do have to
get to my charity thing

13:35.945 --> 13:38.513
at the youth shelter, but
I don't want to rush you.

13:39.601 --> 13:40.776
- Totally. Yeah. What are we
gonna do?

13:40.820 --> 13:42.038
Or we're gonna like stand
around all day

13:42.082 --> 13:43.866
and talk about how I thought I
saw a ghost

13:43.910 --> 13:45.302
in a new apartment.

13:45.346 --> 13:48.131
I'm sorry. I'm the weirdest
neighbor you knew ever.

13:48.175 --> 13:50.177
And don't be a stranger.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.875
[ominous music]

14:01.753 --> 14:04.844
[crystal clattering]

14:07.934 --> 14:10.588
[ominous music]

14:24.951 --> 14:27.518
[door banging]

14:29.520 --> 14:33.611
[diminishing invigorating music]

14:37.224 --> 14:38.660
- That's so dumb.

14:40.270 --> 14:41.793
- No, it's just weird.

14:41.837 --> 14:44.361
It's like you go your whole
life thinking certain things

14:44.405 --> 14:45.928
are always gonna be a mystery.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.930
Like the identity of Jack the
Ripper

14:47.974 --> 14:51.934
or Bermuda triangle or the
great pyramids.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.762
- Pyramids aren't a mystery
anymore.

14:53.805 --> 14:54.981
I saw this YouTube video

14:55.024 --> 14:57.113
and they're just ramps in wet
sand.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.725
- All right. Well, a lot of
things are still mysteries.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.945
You just don't expect to witness
one on a shitty afternoon

15:02.989 --> 15:04.425
in your cheap apartment,

15:04.468 --> 15:06.166
- We are more surveilled
than ever in our own history.

15:06.209 --> 15:07.732
Everyone has a camera
phone in their pocket

15:07.776 --> 15:10.387
and we still don't have
even a single actual bit

15:10.431 --> 15:15.392
of evidence for a ghost
or supernatural, whatever.

15:15.436 --> 15:17.438
[ominous music]

15:17.481 --> 15:18.918
Man, there it is.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.184
It's right there.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.664
- It's weird though. I
don't necessarily feel.

15:28.188 --> 15:29.276
[ominous music]

15:29.319 --> 15:30.277
Do you feel scared?

15:31.887 --> 15:33.106
- When it was happening,

15:33.149 --> 15:35.108
when we're looking at it, I
really did,

15:36.892 --> 15:41.897
but it's getting replaced by
something.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.030
- All right, this is gonna
sound weird

15:44.073 --> 15:45.335
because you and me just met

15:45.379 --> 15:48.643
but when I first moved out to
LA,

15:48.686 --> 15:50.732
you get a job bar backing.

15:50.775 --> 15:54.257
And one of my first days
I'm polishing a glass

15:54.301 --> 15:56.390
and this dude behind the bar is
like,

15:56.433 --> 15:58.653
"Hey, how long are you gonna
give it?"

15:58.696 --> 16:01.743
Like, how long am I gonna give
it to strike gold out west?

16:01.786 --> 16:02.700
And I tell him,

16:04.615 --> 16:06.617
actually what do you think I
told him?

16:08.054 --> 16:09.446
- 39 Years.

16:12.536 --> 16:15.626
- I said 10 but it ended up
being 20.

16:15.670 --> 16:18.064
And I'm still driving
the same shitty Mazda,

16:19.630 --> 16:22.546
to the same bar, except my
kidneys hurt,

16:22.590 --> 16:25.810
I am self medicating and
pretty sure my liver is shot.

16:26.681 --> 16:27.987
All right, so like photography,
right?

16:28.030 --> 16:30.641
Like that was supposed
to be your golden egg.

16:31.599 --> 16:32.861
The thing you're passionate
about,

16:32.904 --> 16:33.993
the thing that allows
you to make a living,

16:34.036 --> 16:36.517
but it hasn't worked out for
you yet.

16:36.560 --> 16:40.347
Life tons of things like that,
dude, tons.

16:40.390 --> 16:43.045
Life's weird. Like sometimes
things just don't happen,

16:43.089 --> 16:45.178
but that happened, right?

16:46.092 --> 16:47.702
And that's more scarce than
gold.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.878
It's like proof of the
supernatural.

16:49.921 --> 16:52.794
That's like, book deals and
like movies

16:52.837 --> 16:56.145
and like TV shows and like
religious views

16:56.189 --> 16:57.886
and shit getting.

17:02.499 --> 17:04.197
- So what do we do?

17:04.240 --> 17:07.156
[knocking on the door]

17:07.200 --> 17:08.027
- Hello?

17:11.117 --> 17:12.466
Hello.

17:12.509 --> 17:13.641
- Hello.

17:13.684 --> 17:17.166
[airplane engine roaring]

17:21.083 --> 17:22.041
- Oh Jesus.

17:27.176 --> 17:28.960
- So, the house I grew up in,

17:29.004 --> 17:30.005
had this big ass windows,

17:30.049 --> 17:31.702
the pigeons could not see,

17:31.746 --> 17:33.139
they just slam into it.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.402
And you can't tell at first,

17:35.445 --> 17:36.968
whether they are just like
stunned

17:37.012 --> 17:38.709
or their brains are mush,

17:38.753 --> 17:41.582
we build these things
and it protects them.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.758
So they don't get eaten by like
a cat

17:43.801 --> 17:46.413
and shit while we wait to
see if they wake up or not.

17:46.456 --> 17:48.502
- Oh, we will never get the
full effect of it on a podcast.

17:49.503 --> 17:50.721
- What?

17:50.765 --> 17:51.983
- We're gonna try to
prove the supernatural.

17:52.027 --> 17:54.116
We're gonna need some kind of
visuals.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.378
People won't believe it.

17:57.032 --> 17:58.860
- What are you thinking like a
YouTube channel or something?

17:58.903 --> 18:00.122
- YouTube is like a whole like
subscriber,

18:00.166 --> 18:02.820
metadata algorithm, hot girl
thumbnail,

18:02.864 --> 18:03.952
like channel subscribe.

18:03.995 --> 18:06.302
I don't understand YouTube.

18:13.788 --> 18:16.182
I was thinking a documentary.

18:19.402 --> 18:23.928
- All right. Well, I actually
do have to run to work now,

18:23.972 --> 18:26.844
but I don't think I work
tomorrow night.

18:26.888 --> 18:29.108
If you wanted to reconvene
then get it started.

18:30.457 --> 18:31.719
- Yeah, let's do it.

18:32.807 --> 18:33.808
- All right.

18:35.549 --> 18:38.204
[Levi groaning]

18:41.294 --> 18:43.818
Is it possible this is
extremely dangerous

18:43.861 --> 18:46.081
and we just completely
overlooked that part?

18:50.129 --> 18:53.480
- No one's ever died of like a
demon or a ghost or whatever.

18:53.523 --> 18:57.136
It's always just slamming
cabinets and doors

18:57.179 --> 18:59.964
and like cold spots and stuff.

19:00.008 --> 19:02.358
- Totally. So if it gets
dangerous, we just stop.

19:02.402 --> 19:03.707
Easy, right?

19:03.751 --> 19:04.882
I'll see you then.

19:04.926 --> 19:06.188
Can you take care of that

19:06.232 --> 19:07.450
to put somewhere safe on
the side of the house.

19:08.843 --> 19:13.848
Hey, hi. So sorry. I did
not make it to the thing.

19:15.980 --> 19:18.418
- Yeah. First I did find
it a little bit strange

19:18.461 --> 19:20.376
that the youth shelter
that Levi volunteers

19:20.420 --> 19:22.465
that would send somebody to
check on him

19:22.509 --> 19:24.337
when he doesn't show up, but...

19:25.425 --> 19:26.991
- [Isabel] I'm sorry.

19:27.035 --> 19:30.212
I think your bio was in one
of the destroyed hard drives.

19:30.256 --> 19:33.172
Maybe let's get that first.
Okay?

19:33.215 --> 19:34.782
- Yeah. Okay.

19:34.825 --> 19:36.262
- [Levi] Just because this feels
a little bit weird is okay.

19:36.305 --> 19:37.698
If I just look at you,

19:37.741 --> 19:39.265
I know John likes it like this,

19:39.308 --> 19:41.441
but you could just.

19:41.484 --> 19:43.965
- [John] I started out with
photography

19:44.008 --> 19:45.445
and I thought a better way

19:45.488 --> 19:47.751
to finance photography was
to become a math teacher.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.144
I thought it'd be more chill.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.754
I thought I'll be the cool
teacher,

19:51.842 --> 19:53.017
but those kids they just hated
me.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.367
Even though I adjusted the
curve so much,

19:54.410 --> 19:56.282
I should've been fired.

19:56.325 --> 20:00.547
Some people, they like
kids, but they are not good.

20:00.590 --> 20:03.202
Anyways, I fell in love with
Lonnie

20:03.245 --> 20:05.639
and chased him out here to LA.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.991
Now I spend my days and
nights charging scooters,

20:10.034 --> 20:12.994
and I hope that the rent check
clears

20:13.037 --> 20:14.865
so that I'm not moving in with
my grandma

20:14.909 --> 20:16.084
when I'm in my thirties.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.043
Move on to the

20:19.087 --> 20:19.914
convict thing?

20:21.437 --> 20:22.917
- [Levi] I mean, I think the
reason why I got into this

20:22.960 --> 20:27.313
with John was that I just
loved watching X Files with

20:27.661 --> 20:30.011
my sister I was little.

20:30.054 --> 20:33.057
Now it's like everything
like the X Files I guess.

20:33.101 --> 20:35.364
- [John] Even though Levi
played it off really well,

20:35.408 --> 20:38.193
I knew something about that guy
was...

20:39.063 --> 20:42.241
[soft soothing music]

20:43.416 --> 20:45.635
You know I'll say this.

20:45.679 --> 20:48.464
I can totally see why he
wouldn't want to share like
that.

20:50.510 --> 20:53.208
[ominous music]

21:21.367 --> 21:22.629
Hey, careful with the threading
on

21:22.672 --> 21:23.978
that thing it's kinda old.

21:27.764 --> 21:28.809
Is your phone okay?

21:28.852 --> 21:29.897
- Yeah, I'm all good.

21:32.552 --> 21:35.685
- God, all that heat just
coming from the closet?

21:35.729 --> 21:37.992
- Yeah, it is hot as shit.

21:38.906 --> 21:43.345
I have this theory that the
downstairs unit is vacant

21:43.389 --> 21:45.434
and maybe like someone left on
a heater

21:45.478 --> 21:49.525
or how kind of sweet would
ghost fire be?

21:49.569 --> 21:52.398
- Yeah, how much do you
think like Netflix pays

21:52.441 --> 21:54.051
for one of these documentaries.

21:54.095 --> 21:55.314
Let's say about movies selling

21:55.357 --> 21:58.099
at film festivals for millions
of dollars.

21:58.142 --> 22:00.101
So I would say at least like 10
million,

22:00.144 --> 22:01.407
something like that.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.844
- Honestly, that sounds kind of
low.

22:04.758 --> 22:07.674
Oh, hey. I know it's a
little early for this,

22:07.717 --> 22:10.459
but I was thinking a
little bit about the title.

22:11.721 --> 22:12.548
All right, check this out.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.422
"Something in the light."

22:19.947 --> 22:20.774
Isn't that cool?

22:23.516 --> 22:24.604
I get it.

22:24.647 --> 22:26.257
- Yeah, because of the fucking
light.

22:27.563 --> 22:29.348
That's dope. I thought of one
too.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.624
"The door that wouldn't shut."

22:44.667 --> 22:46.669
[door cringing]

22:46.713 --> 22:47.540
- For the title?

22:49.759 --> 22:51.065
That's cool.

22:51.108 --> 22:51.935
- Thank you.

22:56.766 --> 22:59.029
- It's probably got too
syllables
though, you know. Right?

23:01.728 --> 23:04.644
[camera shuttering]

23:04.687 --> 23:06.472
- I'm pretty sure that's almost

23:06.515 --> 23:09.649
the exact same amount of,
what was the other one?

23:09.692 --> 23:11.694
- It's got one more syllable.

23:11.738 --> 23:13.000
It's hard to remember.

23:13.043 --> 23:15.176
So titles are important.

23:17.613 --> 23:20.964
[footsteps diminishing]

23:27.884 --> 23:30.321
[TV hissing]

23:37.459 --> 23:40.114
[air whooshing]

23:47.774 --> 23:49.602
- [John] Praise Jesus.

23:50.516 --> 23:53.170
[air whooshing]

24:05.095 --> 24:08.011
[crystal clanking]

24:08.055 --> 24:10.492
I guess that waits for you for
that part.

24:10.536 --> 24:13.364
[crystal beeping]

24:15.541 --> 24:18.239
You rolling? You rolling?

24:18.282 --> 24:19.545
- Oh shit.

24:19.588 --> 24:22.025
[rapid beeping]

24:22.069 --> 24:23.200
- Wait.

24:23.244 --> 24:26.377
[camera beeping]

24:26.421 --> 24:30.425
Fuck. Camera overheated
and the SD card was full.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.427
So we couldn't have
gotten anything anyways.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.081
- I might've gotten
something on the film camera,

24:34.124 --> 24:36.997
but I doubt it and I didn't
charge the batteries.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.260
So welcome to amateur hour.

24:39.303 --> 24:41.610
- Dude. I feel like if you
get anything on day one,

24:41.654 --> 24:42.611
that's a win.

24:42.655 --> 24:43.830
- We didn't get anything.

24:43.873 --> 24:46.397
Your camera was completely out
of focus.

24:46.441 --> 24:47.747
- I don't think it was.

24:47.790 --> 24:50.532
And also I just feel
like this is an indicator

24:50.576 --> 24:54.623
that we need a better
plan, better equipment,

24:54.667 --> 24:57.583
real cameras, real
lighting, real microphones.

24:57.626 --> 24:58.845
- This is real.

24:58.888 --> 25:00.324
- No, but I mean like
professional stuff,

25:00.368 --> 25:01.674
like when you see politicians

25:01.717 --> 25:04.024
and they got all microphones
on their collars.

25:04.067 --> 25:05.939
We should like divvy up tasks.

25:05.982 --> 25:08.289
Like you be the main camera guy

25:08.332 --> 25:10.030
and I'll be the supplementary
camera guy.

25:10.073 --> 25:11.901
I could do all the audio stuff.

25:11.945 --> 25:16.427
And you could do like
the video organizing.

25:16.471 --> 25:17.428
- Data manager.

25:17.472 --> 25:18.647
- Data entry. Exactly.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.477
And obviously we don't know
when exactly

25:22.521 --> 25:23.565
this thing's happening.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.524
We're probably going to take
shifts.

25:25.567 --> 25:28.091
So, here you go.

25:29.745 --> 25:30.920
Remember to lock up,

25:30.964 --> 25:33.575
remember to leave all the
windows open.

25:33.619 --> 25:34.750
So you don't fucking cook us.

25:34.794 --> 25:35.838
- You know this is how stupid
people

25:35.882 --> 25:37.536
get murdered on "Dateline,"
right?

25:38.580 --> 25:39.799
- You're gonna murder me?

25:43.498 --> 25:45.413
- No one's getting murdered.

25:45.456 --> 25:47.197
And ghosts can't kill you
either.

25:47.241 --> 25:48.416
- You keep saying that,

25:48.459 --> 25:51.854
but you're not Dana Fox or
Mulder Scully.

25:51.898 --> 25:52.986
- How do you think a ghost
kills someone.

25:53.029 --> 25:54.422
It has a ghost knife?

25:54.465 --> 25:56.729
They just like pull out their
ghost shank

25:56.772 --> 25:58.600
and they stab you and ghost
pre...

25:58.644 --> 25:59.775
What is that?

25:59.819 --> 26:01.342
- It's just like an energy
supplement.

26:01.385 --> 26:03.126
I get out this nutropics
website.

26:05.738 --> 26:06.565
- Are they safe?

26:08.958 --> 26:11.439
- Yeah, it's just like a
all natural amino acids.

26:12.658 --> 26:15.312
[ominous music]

26:29.196 --> 26:32.591
[upbeat music]

27:01.532 --> 27:04.840
[diminishing soft music]

27:04.884 --> 27:06.929
- Kind of hard to explain,

27:06.973 --> 27:08.539
but yeah. I mean, I'm kind of
an idiot.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.759
I was supposed to do
something with him tonight,

27:10.803 --> 27:12.631
but I forgot to get his contact
info

27:12.674 --> 27:13.719
and he's not home so.

27:16.852 --> 27:18.201
Grandma you're genius.

27:19.942 --> 27:22.902
Yeah. He's gotta be on some
kind of social media somewhere.

27:24.207 --> 27:26.862
[ominous music]

27:28.734 --> 27:33.608
Sorry. Yeah. I'll call you back
later on.

27:33.652 --> 27:34.478
I love you. Bye.

27:41.790 --> 27:44.663
[banging on door]

27:49.189 --> 27:50.059
- What's up man.

27:50.103 --> 27:51.147
Oh, they make me dress like this

27:51.191 --> 27:52.322
for like the speakeasy and shit,

27:52.366 --> 27:53.541
it fucking sucks.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.326
Did I get the right hard drives?

27:57.327 --> 27:58.851
Dope, I actually,

27:58.894 --> 28:00.287
I picked up a high decibel
camera right next to my work.

28:00.330 --> 28:01.984
So, I have that too.

28:02.855 --> 28:04.813
Did you get the gear?

28:06.075 --> 28:07.250
- Yeah.

28:07.294 --> 28:08.643
- Awesome. Okay.

28:09.644 --> 28:11.080
Are we're gonna do this or...

28:13.779 --> 28:14.649
- Yeah.

28:16.042 --> 28:17.608
- And the gear?

28:17.652 --> 28:18.479
- Yeah.

28:20.263 --> 28:22.918
[ominous music]

28:33.668 --> 28:36.323
[bell jingling]

28:38.934 --> 28:41.632
[ominous music]

29:04.568 --> 29:07.484
[camera stand falling]

29:07.528 --> 29:10.792
- Hey John. I know I said I
could do this,

29:10.836 --> 29:13.142
but I was incorrect.

29:13.186 --> 29:15.101
Do you mind helping me out.

29:18.452 --> 29:19.279
Thanks bud.

29:21.107 --> 29:22.717
This camera's basically
what I was talking about

29:22.761 --> 29:24.937
in terms of a bigger thing and
actually never told you this.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.155
I was gonna buy a bunch

29:26.199 --> 29:27.896
of camera equipment several
years back,

29:27.940 --> 29:29.028
but someone told me my tips
would up

29:29.071 --> 29:31.508
to like 20 to 40% if I fixed my
teeth.

29:31.552 --> 29:33.815
So I got braces, spent
all the money on that.

29:33.859 --> 29:36.165
Didn't get the camera
equipment, check this out.

29:40.430 --> 29:41.518
- You are on the audio.

29:42.911 --> 29:43.956
- Was I supposed to?

29:43.999 --> 29:44.826
- I already got it.

29:47.481 --> 29:52.051
- So, are you being weird
because we forgot to run audio?

29:52.094 --> 29:54.009
- The other day in front of our
place.

29:55.097 --> 29:56.620
Who was that?

29:56.664 --> 29:59.623
- That was my probation
counselor.

29:59.667 --> 30:02.191
I told you I've got the charity
thing

30:02.235 --> 30:03.584
I do at the youth shelter

30:03.627 --> 30:04.933
and they just get really
weird when I don't show up

30:04.977 --> 30:06.021
or I'm late or anything.

30:06.065 --> 30:07.414
- You know that everyone would
say

30:07.457 --> 30:09.329
there's a huge difference
between volunteer work

30:09.372 --> 30:10.765
and mandatory community service.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.114
- I don't want to get
caught up in the weeds

30:12.158 --> 30:15.552
of what exactly that's called.

30:15.596 --> 30:17.206
- You want to tell me what
you did to get yourself a PO.

30:17.250 --> 30:20.514
- It is a not an interesting
story, not even worth telling.

30:25.867 --> 30:30.829
So you read online that I'm
a registered sex offender.

30:35.007 --> 30:35.877
- What?

30:35.921 --> 30:38.227
- I was having to go cocktails,

30:38.271 --> 30:40.795
during one of the big city-wide
shutdowns

30:40.839 --> 30:42.362
and I had to piss really bad.

30:42.405 --> 30:45.582
There were literally no
restrooms open anywhere.

30:45.626 --> 30:48.934
I see this alley, I go back
there I am relieving myself

30:48.977 --> 30:49.891
and the next thing I know,

30:49.935 --> 30:51.197
I'm pissing all over my shoes

30:51.240 --> 30:52.372
because the cop handcuffed...

30:52.415 --> 30:53.503
[bottle breaking]

30:53.547 --> 30:55.070
That was the wall of a daycare
center.

30:55.114 --> 30:57.464
A closed daycare center.

31:01.076 --> 31:02.034
- Is that true?

31:02.077 --> 31:04.210
- Yeah. It's true.

31:04.253 --> 31:05.515
I mean you can look up the
court record

31:05.559 --> 31:06.690
that those things are really
dry.

31:06.734 --> 31:08.344
And I just gave the cliff notes
version

31:08.388 --> 31:10.042
and it's really hard to defend
yourself

31:10.085 --> 31:13.828
against pedophilia allegations
wearing a fucking bow tie.

31:24.970 --> 31:27.581
[soft humming]

31:38.418 --> 31:41.421
[TV humming softly]

31:53.346 --> 31:54.869
- We are rolling?

31:54.913 --> 31:55.957
- Yeah, we are rolling.

31:58.873 --> 32:01.702
[camera clicking]

32:04.879 --> 32:08.230
When I was younger I did
this thing called geocaching.

32:08.274 --> 32:09.536
It's kind of like scavenger
hunting,

32:09.579 --> 32:11.059
but for adults with the GPS

32:12.321 --> 32:17.239
and 10 or 20 years ago I found
this book

32:17.283 --> 32:19.372
and it was really cool

32:19.415 --> 32:21.722
kind of pseudoscience coffee
table book.

32:21.765 --> 32:23.854
It's called the "Geometry of
Magnetism."

32:25.117 --> 32:27.771
And it's written in like
Esperanto

32:27.815 --> 32:29.686
and the author's name was
redacted.

32:32.254 --> 32:37.259
I swear to you, that symbol
is on the cover of my book.

32:40.523 --> 32:43.613
- What? That's not very ghost
like.

32:43.657 --> 32:44.484
- No.

32:48.270 --> 32:49.402
Do I seem okay?

32:52.796 --> 32:53.580
- I don't know.

32:53.623 --> 32:54.450
I don't know you.

32:54.494 --> 32:56.017
- No, I mean, do I seem like

32:56.061 --> 32:58.150
I'm having some kind of a
psychotic break?

33:00.500 --> 33:02.589
- No, psychotic breaks
are totally different.

33:05.809 --> 33:09.639
[soft wind whistling]

33:09.683 --> 33:12.338
- If you're a ghost, do
something.

33:14.383 --> 33:17.560
[soft wind whistling]

33:18.431 --> 33:20.346
Do something different.

33:25.090 --> 33:26.787
I mean, we don't actually have
any reason

33:26.830 --> 33:29.224
to think that this is a
ghost or a Poltergeist.

33:29.268 --> 33:31.835
It's the first of movies
or books that you've read.

33:33.359 --> 33:34.621
We might have this all wrong.

33:37.450 --> 33:38.712
- So what is it?

33:41.062 --> 33:41.976
- That's the question?

33:44.326 --> 33:48.156
[resonant rejuvenating music]

33:55.163 --> 33:56.164
The symbol that's on my book

33:56.208 --> 33:58.514
and that was on that refraction.

33:58.558 --> 34:01.126
I swear to God, I've also been
seeing it all over the city.

34:03.258 --> 34:07.088
[resonant rejuvenating music]

34:08.611 --> 34:11.527
Look, all of this is the EM
spectrum,

34:11.571 --> 34:14.617
ElectroMagnetic spectrum,
it's radio waves on up

34:14.661 --> 34:17.751
to the visible light and
this is using derivatives

34:17.794 --> 34:19.405
to find acceleration of
velocity,

34:19.448 --> 34:21.711
but look the value for gravity
is wrong.

34:21.755 --> 34:23.974
They just changed it. And
I don't really know why.

34:24.018 --> 34:25.933
And then this is a ratio

34:25.976 --> 34:27.848
that's kind of like pi,

34:27.891 --> 34:29.328
which people call them golden
ratio.

34:29.371 --> 34:32.113
- Are we quoting Dan
Brown books right now?

34:32.157 --> 34:33.506
- What?

34:33.549 --> 34:34.724
- I'm not making it a
Divinci Code documentary.

34:34.768 --> 34:37.466
- No, Jesus, no, it's just a
ratio.

34:37.510 --> 34:40.295
It's not exactly the
Fibonacci sequence or phi

34:40.339 --> 34:41.470
or the golden ratio or whatever.

34:41.514 --> 34:42.863
It's just an irrational number

34:42.906 --> 34:44.386
with infinite decimals out to
infinity.

34:44.430 --> 34:46.475
There are millions of
irrational numbers.

34:46.519 --> 34:49.130
This is common in the world and
in math.

34:49.174 --> 34:52.133
And it has something
to do with a rectangle,

34:52.177 --> 34:53.961
that when it's expressed as a
ratio,

34:54.004 --> 34:56.181
it is that irrational number.

34:56.224 --> 34:57.791
I don't know what it means
either.

35:00.185 --> 35:01.708
- This has nothing to
do with nautilus shells

35:01.751 --> 35:03.057
the Grail or Stonehenge?

35:05.015 --> 35:08.497
[airplane engine roaring]

35:10.151 --> 35:13.459
[electric static noise]

35:15.591 --> 35:17.463
- Everything we've seen so far.

35:17.506 --> 35:19.117
It's either been on

35:19.160 --> 35:21.858
the EM spectrum visible
light, radio waves or...

35:24.470 --> 35:28.778
[resonant rejuvenating music]

35:28.822 --> 35:29.649
Gravity.

35:30.476 --> 35:34.306
[resonant rejuvenating music]

35:45.317 --> 35:47.101
- Okay. So it's like,

35:48.058 --> 35:49.234
There is one for gravity

35:50.365 --> 35:51.758
and there's one for electrical
shock.

35:51.801 --> 35:52.802
- Electromagnetism.

35:52.846 --> 35:53.847
- Right, yeah.

35:53.890 --> 35:55.283
- Maybe there's two of them.

35:56.241 --> 35:57.111
- Two what?

36:02.029 --> 36:03.639
Man, I hope the neighbors are
all right?

36:05.163 --> 36:06.599
- I heard there was a murder.

36:07.469 --> 36:09.906
- Hey, I keep having this
thought.

36:09.950 --> 36:10.733
Mind giving me a light really
quick?

36:10.777 --> 36:11.604
- I got you.

36:12.518 --> 36:13.345
- Jesus.

36:16.826 --> 36:18.088
Okay.

36:18.132 --> 36:20.917
Here you go. Don't
forget you get to inhale.

36:20.961 --> 36:24.094
- When we first met, you said
this phrase,

36:24.138 --> 36:27.402
it was, "You can only fall so
fast."

36:27.446 --> 36:28.534
Why did you say that?

36:30.623 --> 36:32.451
- I wanted to be a skydive
instructor.

36:32.494 --> 36:33.452
- No shit.

36:33.495 --> 36:34.366
- Yeah.

36:34.409 --> 36:35.149
- How many times did you jump?

36:35.193 --> 36:36.629
- One.

36:36.672 --> 36:37.804
- And then I was like,

36:37.847 --> 36:39.806
Hey, maybe I'll like start a
band,

36:39.849 --> 36:41.938
but how do you find all
those different people

36:41.982 --> 36:44.245
to play those individual
instruments?

36:46.160 --> 36:47.030
And then I was like,

36:47.074 --> 36:47.944
well, maybe I'll get into like

36:47.988 --> 36:49.772
the skateboard apparel industry,

36:49.816 --> 36:51.339
but for some reason my parol
counselor

36:51.383 --> 36:54.212
was really against me
getting into fashion.

36:57.084 --> 37:00.957
And I wanted to work on a
fishing boat in Jamaica,

37:01.001 --> 37:02.742
maybe like surfing tours or
something.

37:02.785 --> 37:07.355
But there's some legal
issues with the passport.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.837
The point is that nothing
ever quite clicked.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.578
- Yes. I floated around a lot
too.

37:17.191 --> 37:21.326
I feel like I was built for
this.

37:23.980 --> 37:25.895
- I would also think I was
built for this

37:25.939 --> 37:28.333
if my thing was electricity

37:28.376 --> 37:31.205
and treasure hunting and not
gravity.

37:33.381 --> 37:35.253
- There's nothing to that?

37:35.296 --> 37:37.211
- I mean my entire life,

37:37.255 --> 37:40.083
I felt like there's like
this invisible force

37:40.127 --> 37:43.783
just holding me back from
accomplishing anything

37:43.826 --> 37:45.698
I dream about, anything I want
to do.

37:45.741 --> 37:47.003
- That's super depressing

37:47.047 --> 37:48.396
and you should talk to
a therapist about that.

37:48.440 --> 37:51.399
- I am not like a
continuously depressed person.

37:52.922 --> 37:55.142
This cop just totally parked in
my space.

37:56.099 --> 37:59.102
I just feel like someone
chucked me out of an airplane

37:59.146 --> 38:00.495
when I was a baby.

38:00.539 --> 38:03.890
And I've been at terminal
velocity my entire life.

38:03.933 --> 38:08.416
I didn't ask that person to
chuck me out of that airplane.

38:17.556 --> 38:20.080
[cop cursing]

38:22.822 --> 38:24.214
- How does your parole work.

38:25.912 --> 38:28.654
[deep breathing]

38:50.589 --> 38:53.592
[knock on the door]

39:00.381 --> 39:01.600
You know it's insanely weird

39:01.643 --> 39:03.906
that you give apples
to kids for Halloween.

39:03.950 --> 39:05.081
Actually you know it's weird,

39:05.125 --> 39:06.648
is that their parents don't
just check

39:06.692 --> 39:08.824
the sex offender registry before
they send them marching up

39:08.868 --> 39:09.738
to your door.

39:09.782 --> 39:10.652
You know, they're gonna check

39:10.696 --> 39:12.088
those apples for razors though.

39:12.132 --> 39:14.003
- The OD across the way was
originally

39:14.047 --> 39:15.309
put it is a murder

39:15.353 --> 39:16.484
and parents still bring
their children there.

39:16.528 --> 39:17.964
I don't think they're worried
about

39:18.007 --> 39:19.879
the who guy peed on a wall.

39:19.922 --> 39:22.577
[camera shuttering]

39:22.621 --> 39:25.319
[ominous music]

39:47.080 --> 39:49.735
[door cringing]

39:50.736 --> 39:53.391
[ominous music]

40:04.924 --> 40:07.840
[items clattering]

40:17.545 --> 40:19.068
- [Robert] Well, basically when
people buy

40:19.112 --> 40:20.853
or build on a property,

40:20.896 --> 40:23.159
they hire me to come in

40:23.203 --> 40:25.466
and assess for any geologic
hazards,

40:25.510 --> 40:30.558
landslides, seismic activity,
sink holes, volcanoes.

40:30.602 --> 40:33.169
- [John] Volcanoes? Are you
serious?

40:33.213 --> 40:34.910
- Yeah. Volcanoes.

40:34.954 --> 40:36.216
[ominous music]

40:36.259 --> 40:37.347
- [John] That's awesome.

40:37.391 --> 40:38.566
Can you just tell me what you
found

40:38.610 --> 40:40.655
in the soil samples beneath the
apartment?

40:40.699 --> 40:42.091
- Yeah. Well, I know you were
concerned

40:42.135 --> 40:43.615
that there were some anomalies.

40:43.658 --> 40:46.269
The chromium was a little high.

40:46.313 --> 40:47.445
There was some Lead in there.

40:47.488 --> 40:50.317
I have some from pre 1978 paint
job,

40:50.360 --> 40:52.493
but everything was okay.

40:52.537 --> 40:55.148
No more arsenic or anything
like that.

40:55.191 --> 40:57.846
- [John] The other.
The other thing I know.

40:57.890 --> 40:58.978
- What's that?

40:59.021 --> 41:00.545
- [John] The crystal thing.

41:00.588 --> 41:01.763
- The crystal?

41:03.504 --> 41:04.462
- Are you all right?

41:06.812 --> 41:10.163
[footsteps approaching]

41:12.557 --> 41:15.037
- Do you mind shooting this
real quick?

41:15.081 --> 41:15.908
- Why?

41:17.910 --> 41:20.565
- Well, it's supposed to be 175

41:22.218 --> 41:25.831
and it's obviously much lower.

41:25.874 --> 41:27.267
And if gravity is fluctuating

41:27.310 --> 41:28.877
that much it could be really
messing

41:28.921 --> 41:31.445
with the foundation of the
building

41:31.489 --> 41:34.143
and that earthquake had
just been a warning shot.

41:36.581 --> 41:38.583
- I don't want to invalidate
what you're saying at all.

41:38.626 --> 41:40.280
It's just, you know what I
mean we live in Los Angeles,

41:40.323 --> 41:41.542
there's earthquakes all the time

41:41.586 --> 41:46.025
and people's weight
fluctuates. It's normal.

41:46.068 --> 41:47.417
I mean, it just think

41:47.461 --> 41:48.854
we've got to be kind of
scientific about this,

41:48.897 --> 41:52.727
we can't just assign meaning
to every little thing.

41:52.771 --> 41:54.120
- I get all that,

41:54.163 --> 41:57.427
but if in a month we got
from some floating things

41:57.471 --> 42:00.779
and some lights to
earthquakes by New Year's

42:00.822 --> 42:02.607
we would be under rubble.

42:02.650 --> 42:04.783
And we did agree when we
started this,

42:04.826 --> 42:07.176
that if we felt like we
were in danger, we'd stop.

42:07.220 --> 42:08.961
And I'm not saying we should
stop.

42:09.831 --> 42:12.442
I think we should at
least acknowledge this.

42:18.448 --> 42:21.974
- I've been giving some thought
to that title you suggested.

42:22.017 --> 42:26.239
And honestly I think I just
judged it a little too early

42:26.282 --> 42:27.762
and I think it's thematically
resonant

42:27.806 --> 42:29.895
with what we're trying to do
here.

42:29.938 --> 42:32.245
And I think we should use it.

42:37.642 --> 42:39.774
- "The door that wouldn't shut."

42:41.646 --> 42:44.605
[ghostly whistling]

42:48.217 --> 42:51.569
[Electric static noise]

42:54.267 --> 42:56.922
[ominous music]

42:58.837 --> 43:02.014
- Hey, can you mute that really
quick?

43:05.495 --> 43:08.150
[ominous music]

43:20.946 --> 43:23.601
[door cringing]

43:24.993 --> 43:27.648
[ominous music]

43:46.493 --> 43:48.016
- I listen to this podcast,

43:48.060 --> 43:50.279
actually can you record that
really quick on your camera?

43:53.456 --> 43:54.762
- So, we're rolling.

43:56.198 --> 43:58.984
- I have this podcast
that I listened to by,

44:01.160 --> 44:02.074
I don't even know.

44:03.205 --> 44:07.645
He has this kind of wild
unifying theory

44:07.688 --> 44:12.650
of the universe that the
aliens actually planted

44:13.259 --> 44:14.869
the building blocks of life on
earth

44:14.913 --> 44:17.829
as some kind of a science
experiment.

44:17.872 --> 44:19.700
And they don't want to
contaminate their experiment,

44:19.744 --> 44:21.659
which is why we don't hear from
them,

44:21.702 --> 44:23.878
but we will make contact

44:23.922 --> 44:25.314
or they will make contact at
some point

44:25.358 --> 44:29.014
once we are socially and
politically evolved enough.

44:29.057 --> 44:31.277
So maybe that's now maybe
that's us,

44:31.320 --> 44:34.715
and maybe the heat and all
these critters

44:34.759 --> 44:36.325
and all of that is just
the flora and fauna

44:36.369 --> 44:38.458
and weather on another planet.

44:45.247 --> 44:47.162
- And that's actually
a really interesting,

44:47.206 --> 44:50.557
do you mind if I jump in
there and just kind of, okay,

44:50.600 --> 44:52.385
I'm just gonna have to get that
frame up.

44:55.083 --> 44:56.868
So here's the thing,

44:56.911 --> 44:59.131
I saw online the other day

44:59.174 --> 45:01.786
that basically scientists think

45:01.829 --> 45:05.528
that there are some planets
sort of like earth, right?

45:05.572 --> 45:07.313
But the nearest one,

45:07.356 --> 45:08.967
like the nearest one
that would have water,

45:09.010 --> 45:10.446
the nearest one to have
like little critter

45:10.490 --> 45:11.621
like the one we've been hearing,

45:11.665 --> 45:15.843
it would be like 6,000 years
away using

45:15.887 --> 45:18.454
the best technology we
could possibly come up with.

45:19.804 --> 45:21.153
That being what it is,

45:22.632 --> 45:24.373
how do we explain it being in
my attic?

45:24.417 --> 45:27.725
Also, where did you hear this
podcast?

45:30.075 --> 45:31.903
- Just on a message board
somewhere.

45:33.905 --> 45:36.168
- Are there message pods for
more things

45:36.211 --> 45:38.953
than like anime and finding
contract killers and stuff?

45:38.997 --> 45:40.520
- Just because something sounds

45:40.563 --> 45:42.217
a little bit crazy doesn't
mean it's not partially true.

45:42.261 --> 45:45.133
I mean, that's how you find
truth.

45:45.177 --> 45:48.223
MK ultra, that was actually
mind control.

45:48.267 --> 45:50.399
COINTELPRO that was real,

45:50.443 --> 45:53.663
soft disclosure of UFO's
just happened to Congress.

45:55.578 --> 45:58.059
- Here we are at the launch
status center.

45:58.103 --> 46:01.628
Let's go inside and see if we
can find anybody to talk to.

46:02.803 --> 46:07.025
NASA has known about a time
travel method

46:07.068 --> 46:08.374
of Albert Einstein.

46:08.417 --> 46:10.637
He said, if you travel
at the speed of light,

46:10.680 --> 46:12.073
you can time travel.

46:15.076 --> 46:16.512
- Time travel.

46:16.556 --> 46:18.079
- Start over.

46:18.123 --> 46:20.778
[ominous music]

47:11.959 --> 47:13.569
- There is no light source.

47:17.182 --> 47:19.837
[ominous music]

47:21.142 --> 47:21.969
- Crystal?

47:23.231 --> 47:25.407
You mean the quartz deposits?

47:25.451 --> 47:26.539
- [John] Yeah, and how

47:26.582 --> 47:27.801
it can create electricity and
focus.

47:27.845 --> 47:31.196
- It definitely doesn't
create electricity.

47:31.239 --> 47:33.546
Quartz is the most abundant
mineral in the world.

47:33.589 --> 47:36.854
If you have them underneath
your house you're fine.

47:37.942 --> 47:40.553
[soft humming]

47:41.859 --> 47:44.513
[ominous music]

48:09.625 --> 48:11.714
- [John] In your own words.

48:11.758 --> 48:13.760
Just say what happened here?

48:15.936 --> 48:18.852
- I think that if one was to
express

48:18.896 --> 48:22.769
what you thought happened to
you,

48:22.812 --> 48:24.640
it might be seen as trying

48:24.684 --> 48:26.555
to garner some fame and
attention.

48:26.599 --> 48:29.819
- [John] Wind a minute, you
know, these things found us,

48:29.863 --> 48:31.517
we're not doing it for fame or
recognition

48:31.560 --> 48:33.127
or anything like that.

48:35.608 --> 48:38.176
We just saw something profound

48:39.742 --> 48:42.571
and we wanted to share it with
the world.

48:42.615 --> 48:46.488
I don't know what the
problem with that would be.

48:47.707 --> 48:49.535
- I don't want to be rude.

48:49.578 --> 48:51.189
- [John] It's okay. It's okay.

48:52.320 --> 48:55.715
- Why didn't you play
yourselves in the recreations?

48:58.936 --> 49:01.503
[door banging]

49:06.030 --> 49:09.511
- Is that exactly where
the snake skin was?

49:09.555 --> 49:13.167
- Yeah. It was a little
bit more in a closet,

49:13.211 --> 49:14.603
but I just pulled it a
little out for the shot,

49:14.647 --> 49:16.954
just so it would show up
more on camera on this side.

49:16.997 --> 49:18.651
- Okay. Cool.

49:18.694 --> 49:21.001
Well, I mean your sleep looked
great.

49:21.045 --> 49:22.698
You wanna cut?

49:22.742 --> 49:24.439
- Yeah. Okay. Awesome.

49:24.483 --> 49:28.400
- All right. It's so weird
doing all this stuff over again.

49:28.443 --> 49:31.055
It's like you're taking too
many edibles

49:31.098 --> 49:32.317
and watch Unsolved Mysteries

49:32.360 --> 49:34.493
and you think you on
the recreation sketch.

49:36.321 --> 49:37.148
- [John] Nope.

49:39.063 --> 49:40.194
- Pod of Orcas,

49:40.238 --> 49:41.326
apex predator of the sea

49:41.369 --> 49:43.763
and obviously an Orca has never
attacked

49:43.806 --> 49:45.286
a human in the wild,

49:45.330 --> 49:48.028
but still just out of fucking
respect.

49:48.072 --> 49:49.682
I hold out on the spear

49:50.683 --> 49:52.119
and one of them swims over.

49:52.163 --> 49:53.120
I call him Shamoo.

49:53.164 --> 49:55.905
He swam over and just gently ate

49:57.211 --> 49:58.865
the stingray right off my spear

49:58.908 --> 50:00.388
and then swims away with the
pod singing

50:00.432 --> 50:02.651
these beautiful whale
songs like just for me.

50:02.695 --> 50:04.610
- Hey I keep on having this
idea.

50:04.653 --> 50:06.046
Actually do you mind
rolling this really quick?

50:06.090 --> 50:07.178
I'm sorry. I just.

50:07.221 --> 50:09.702
- Yeah. Yeah. Let's do this.

50:09.745 --> 50:13.401
- So I think you're right about

50:13.445 --> 50:15.447
the distance thing with the
aliens,

50:15.490 --> 50:17.971
I think it's impossible
to had any contact,

50:18.015 --> 50:19.103
it's too far away,

50:19.146 --> 50:21.148
but if the universe is actually

50:21.192 --> 50:24.238
in 10 dimensions like this
Ted talk I listened to,

50:24.282 --> 50:26.762
maybe these gateways to other
dimensions

50:26.806 --> 50:28.112
are actually just all around us.

50:28.155 --> 50:30.244
And the gateways are right top
of us.

50:30.288 --> 50:31.506
We just can't see them.

50:31.550 --> 50:33.813
So maybe your closet down there,

50:33.856 --> 50:37.295
that's just another gateway
to another dimension

50:37.338 --> 50:39.862
that has different temperatures

50:39.906 --> 50:42.952
and different flora and
fauna and our creators,

50:45.346 --> 50:47.261
trying to get us to do
something.

50:52.005 --> 50:53.006
You like it?

50:56.401 --> 50:59.578
- See, that and this,

50:59.621 --> 51:01.841
just a couple of things
I'm gonna miss about LA.

51:01.884 --> 51:03.190
- I think you're crazy if you
are leaving.

51:03.234 --> 51:05.366
- I mean, this is gonna change
everything.

51:09.370 --> 51:12.330
- The other night I was
leaving my shift at work.

51:12.373 --> 51:13.940
I heard a little buzz

51:13.983 --> 51:18.118
and I'm walking home, walking
up Sunset.

51:18.162 --> 51:19.293
There is always people
who are getting ready

51:19.337 --> 51:21.078
for some big, dirty crazy night
out.

51:21.121 --> 51:22.731
And you kind of feel the energy
of it.

51:22.775 --> 51:25.560
And the Santa Ana winds are
blowing

51:25.604 --> 51:30.087
and I look over and it's
another coyote.

51:31.218 --> 51:34.308
He's looking right through
me like I'm a ghost.

51:34.352 --> 51:35.701
And then he just trots off,

51:35.744 --> 51:38.834
down Sunset Boulevard,
that big old coyote smile.

51:38.878 --> 51:42.403
And no one talks about like
those moments in Los Angeles.

51:42.447 --> 51:43.491
People talk about the traffic.

51:43.535 --> 51:44.666
People talk about everything
else,

51:44.710 --> 51:46.320
everything they can complain
about,

51:46.364 --> 51:49.497
but they never talk about
like those magical LA moments.

51:51.760 --> 51:54.111
- Yeah. You got to dig
deep in the city for it but

51:56.330 --> 51:57.723
Magic is there.

51:57.766 --> 51:59.333
- Today I had this fantasy,

51:59.377 --> 52:01.118
I am living in some small town,

52:01.161 --> 52:03.859
like a small town, like
in Stephen King stories,

52:03.903 --> 52:05.078
where you can afford rent

52:05.122 --> 52:06.819
and like some big ass Victorian
house

52:06.862 --> 52:11.824
and get a dog and go to summer
festivals

52:11.867 --> 52:13.304
and eat fresh produce.

52:13.347 --> 52:18.135
And this documentary would
be like my retirement fund

52:18.178 --> 52:19.571
for that life.

52:19.614 --> 52:21.573
- You know, they chose
this location for Hollywood

52:21.616 --> 52:23.140
because of the beautiful light?

52:24.663 --> 52:29.363
I am no Hemingway but I feel
like we found light literally

52:29.407 --> 52:32.105
and metaphorically just
right down in your apartment.

52:33.019 --> 52:34.629
Maybe you should take that as a
sign.

52:34.673 --> 52:36.414
Stick around a little while
longer,

52:36.457 --> 52:37.719
finish this documentary.

52:40.069 --> 52:42.550
You'll see another magic coyote.

52:44.813 --> 52:46.598
Maybe I can set you up with
someone.

52:49.383 --> 52:50.863
- Here we go.

52:50.906 --> 52:52.125
- What?

52:52.169 --> 52:54.649
- Like I've never been
attracted to anyone.

52:56.521 --> 52:58.697
And that is a very hard thing

52:58.740 --> 53:02.266
to explain to people that
you'd be interested in dating.

53:03.919 --> 53:07.401
[airplane engine roaring]

53:10.404 --> 53:12.841
- It's getting a little
unsettling.

53:13.973 --> 53:16.193
- You don't think that has
anything

53:16.236 --> 53:18.717
to do with what we're doing
downstairs,

53:18.760 --> 53:20.545
like it's Bermuda triangle shit.

53:20.588 --> 53:24.897
- No. I get the no attraction
thing,

53:24.940 --> 53:27.682
but you know, Lonnie
for all of his faults,

53:27.726 --> 53:29.945
for all the reasons it didn't
really work out between us,

53:29.989 --> 53:34.036
to me at least he was accepting,

53:34.080 --> 53:36.256
he wanted to bring kids
into this apocalypse,

53:36.300 --> 53:37.953
which is bonkers.

53:39.041 --> 53:40.434
- How do you mean?

53:43.524 --> 53:45.526
- I was out with this guy
one time on one of the apps

53:45.570 --> 53:48.921
and we're talking about all the
ways

53:48.964 --> 53:50.488
that the world could end.

53:51.315 --> 53:54.361
I mean, we're all gonna die,
right?

53:55.536 --> 53:57.146
We're so fixated on not dying,

53:57.190 --> 53:58.060
but it's all gonna happen to us.

53:58.104 --> 53:59.148
So what's the big deal?

53:59.192 --> 54:00.759
I mean what's even the big deal

54:03.327 --> 54:08.332
with like genocides and then
the conversation naturally led

54:09.681 --> 54:12.161
to my church and people get all
binary

54:12.205 --> 54:14.381
when they hear the word
evangelicals.

54:14.425 --> 54:16.992
I mean, people use this phrase
to give themselves peace.

54:17.036 --> 54:18.690
"This too shall pass," right?

54:18.733 --> 54:20.039
But you can just say,

54:20.082 --> 54:22.215
"This to shall end."

54:22.259 --> 54:25.566
It's the same sentiment, the
world's ending for sure. Right?

54:25.610 --> 54:28.569
So why even worry?

54:31.050 --> 54:33.182
You know, it's kinda like you
not wanting

54:34.053 --> 54:35.228
to do it with anyone.

54:36.969 --> 54:38.753
You don't understand it unless
it's you.

54:42.453 --> 54:45.151
- Alright. Actually I got to
get to bed.

54:46.108 --> 54:47.327
- Actually the bar is open soon

54:47.371 --> 54:48.241
if you want we can just
grab a quick drink.

54:48.285 --> 54:50.722
- No, I've got to work tonight.

54:52.985 --> 54:55.640
[ominous music]

55:00.340 --> 55:01.994
- [Narrator] That makes them
quite literally the angels

55:02.037 --> 55:03.952
and not just Abrahamic
religions,

55:03.996 --> 55:06.868
but very likely the
Samaritans and Babylonians.

55:06.912 --> 55:09.306
Well folks tonight, this
lone voice in the desert,

55:09.349 --> 55:12.178
will talk to author, Jesse
Summoner, about his latest book,

55:12.221 --> 55:13.484
"Inter-dimensional Angels,

55:13.527 --> 55:15.529
Spirituality in an
Ultra-Terrestrial

55:15.573 --> 55:16.835
World Multi-Verse."

55:16.878 --> 55:18.315
As well as his lecture series

55:18.358 --> 55:19.794
on the works of John Keel

55:19.838 --> 55:22.580
and research in the so-called
Arcadian time anomalies,

55:22.623 --> 55:23.842
in the world, San Diego.

55:28.847 --> 55:31.502
- Why are you dressed like that?

55:34.287 --> 55:36.376
- I don't want to get
bit by a black widow.

55:37.334 --> 55:39.292
If this thing, going against
the walls.

55:40.598 --> 55:41.990
Bit someone.

55:42.034 --> 55:46.299
We didn't call animal
control. I feel really bad.

55:46.343 --> 55:47.605
- I thought I'd measure

55:47.648 --> 55:50.216
because building codes
have standardized ratios

55:50.259 --> 55:51.957
for a long time.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.438
So you can buy third-party
stuff from Home Depot.

55:55.700 --> 55:57.789
Your closet threshold
has a different ratio

55:57.832 --> 56:00.444
than the rest of the building.

56:00.487 --> 56:03.185
[ominous music]

56:14.893 --> 56:17.809
[glass shattering]

56:18.766 --> 56:21.421
[ominous music]

56:36.871 --> 56:37.872
- Holy shit.

56:39.221 --> 56:41.876
[ominous music]

57:05.770 --> 57:09.948
[electric static from the
device]

57:22.482 --> 57:26.443
[machine whirring indistinctly]

57:36.365 --> 57:39.717
- There's this thing
called Jerusalem syndrome.

57:39.760 --> 57:41.022
It's when people go to

57:41.066 --> 57:43.068
that city for the first
time in the modern day,

57:43.111 --> 57:47.551
they get the sense that their
whole life led to that moment.

57:50.902 --> 57:52.686
I think maybe that's what I'm
doing.

57:53.731 --> 57:56.298
- That's what they speak in
Jerusalem?

57:56.342 --> 57:57.386
- No, that was Greek.

57:58.779 --> 58:00.651
- I had this really cool math
teacher,

58:00.694 --> 58:02.653
the one that got me into math.

58:02.696 --> 58:03.610
And she was this hippie

58:03.654 --> 58:05.743
that would do these long units

58:06.744 --> 58:08.049
on interesting mathematicians.

58:08.093 --> 58:10.443
And she did this whole week on
Pythagoras.

58:11.618 --> 58:12.967
You know, the triangle guy?

58:14.578 --> 58:15.796
A squared + B squared?

58:17.494 --> 58:19.278
High school, middle school?

58:21.149 --> 58:24.892
Anyway, he actually had this
society,

58:24.936 --> 58:26.198
some people called it a cult,

58:26.241 --> 58:28.505
but it was called the
Pythagorean brotherhood.

58:28.548 --> 58:31.551
And they did everything from
a numerology to reincarnation,

58:31.595 --> 58:34.685
to, you know, ritual summoning
magic.

58:34.728 --> 58:35.903
They worshiped numbers.

58:37.078 --> 58:39.994
What I'm getting at is I fully
recognize

58:40.038 --> 58:42.040
that I might be all Jerusalem
syndrome

58:42.083 --> 58:47.088
in LA right now, but I think
maybe that's what this is.

58:49.482 --> 58:51.223
I think it's the Pythagoras.

58:51.266 --> 58:54.531
- Well, why can't be a
group like the Freemasons

58:54.574 --> 58:58.273
or the Moose Lodge or...

58:58.317 --> 58:59.144
- What's that?

59:00.624 --> 59:02.756
- The one that's on discovery
channel all the time.

59:02.800 --> 59:04.758
It's the Rose Croutons.

59:04.802 --> 59:07.587
- The Rose Croutons?

59:07.631 --> 59:08.545
The Rosicrucian's.

59:10.459 --> 59:11.722
Yeah. I mean,

59:11.765 --> 59:13.550
I guess it could be any
fraternal organization,

59:14.551 --> 59:16.727
but when you want to
figure this out, right?

59:20.078 --> 59:23.255
- So you're saying the
shitty apartment next door

59:23.298 --> 59:25.083
is a magic Greek temple.

59:27.041 --> 59:29.696
[ominous music]

59:36.094 --> 59:39.271
- This is just dream logic.

59:45.494 --> 59:47.496
- This isn't a year.

59:49.237 --> 59:51.588
It is the number of days I
spent in a mental institution

59:51.631 --> 59:52.676
when I was a teenager.

59:53.981 --> 59:57.985
- It's like all of your
teenage years, what for?

59:59.857 --> 1:00:03.556
- You're part of an
evangelical Armageddon church.

1:00:03.600 --> 1:00:06.385
And you're judging me for
managing my mental health

1:00:06.428 --> 1:00:07.299
at a young age?

1:00:07.342 --> 1:00:09.910
- I'm not, I'm sincerely not.

1:00:09.954 --> 1:00:11.303
And is that what you've been
acting so weird about today?

1:00:11.346 --> 1:00:12.521
My church group?

1:00:12.565 --> 1:00:13.827
- I am acting weird

1:00:13.871 --> 1:00:17.570
because you compared my sexual
identity

1:00:17.614 --> 1:00:21.748
to your apocalypse church.

1:00:22.923 --> 1:00:25.622
[ominous music]

1:00:36.284 --> 1:00:40.637
- We celebrate Christmas without
believing in Santa, right?

1:00:45.946 --> 1:00:47.121
It's like that.

1:00:47.165 --> 1:00:48.383
It's exactly like that.

1:00:49.689 --> 1:00:51.822
We celebrate and talk about the
end

1:00:51.865 --> 1:00:54.999
because it gives us a sense
of community, progress...

1:00:55.042 --> 1:00:57.479
[diminishing voice]

1:00:57.523 --> 1:00:58.306
- My first thought was,

1:00:58.350 --> 1:00:59.612
"This is my cue to leave."

1:01:02.006 --> 1:01:03.268
Then I'm walking to Griffith
park

1:01:03.311 --> 1:01:04.312
and I'm taking umm...

1:01:07.054 --> 1:01:08.708
And I come across this park
bench

1:01:08.752 --> 1:01:10.318
that has this plaque on it.

1:01:10.362 --> 1:01:12.451
And on the plaque is William
Thomson

1:01:12.494 --> 1:01:16.847
from the tape who turns
out was the city planner.

1:01:16.890 --> 1:01:18.370
- Good work.

1:01:18.413 --> 1:01:19.980
- And I felt like I made a
discovery.

1:01:21.329 --> 1:01:22.287
I made a break through.

1:01:22.330 --> 1:01:25.333
[phone ringing]

1:01:25.377 --> 1:01:27.945
[upbeat music]

1:01:44.396 --> 1:01:46.964
[Levi snoring]

1:01:53.274 --> 1:01:55.842
[upbeat music]

1:02:17.298 --> 1:02:19.953
[ominous music]

1:02:24.697 --> 1:02:27.265
[upbeat music]

1:02:33.488 --> 1:02:36.143
[ominous music]

1:02:38.972 --> 1:02:40.887
[crystal falling]

1:02:40.931 --> 1:02:43.629
[electric static]

1:02:43.672 --> 1:02:46.893
[slow ominous humming]

1:02:53.857 --> 1:02:57.338
[gentle pianissimo music]

1:04:00.967 --> 1:04:03.056
You left the windows closed
again.

1:04:03.100 --> 1:04:06.407
The closet is trying to
cook us in our sleep.

1:04:06.451 --> 1:04:07.931
- Sorry about that.

1:04:07.974 --> 1:04:10.542
I looked up who owned that
website

1:04:10.585 --> 1:04:13.632
and I just found this
social media profile left up

1:04:13.675 --> 1:04:15.416
as a Memorial to some dead guy.

1:04:16.461 --> 1:04:19.029
- We just sorta run something
past you.

1:04:19.072 --> 1:04:23.729
What if that is stop?

1:04:23.772 --> 1:04:25.296
You know, and what if the other
night

1:04:25.339 --> 1:04:28.386
when that block of quartz
was almost dropped to my head

1:04:28.429 --> 1:04:31.128
what if that was a message
that was like, "Hey, stop."

1:04:32.694 --> 1:04:35.784
- We're not quite in dangerous
uncharted territory yet.

1:04:35.828 --> 1:04:37.351
I mean, Jesus man, we're in
Laurel Canyon.

1:04:37.395 --> 1:04:38.613
Harry Houdini used to live here,

1:04:38.657 --> 1:04:40.659
Jim Morrison used to
live here, I don't know.

1:04:40.702 --> 1:04:42.052
Maybe we were just the most
recent people

1:04:42.095 --> 1:04:44.576
that tap into its special
frequency or something.

1:04:44.619 --> 1:04:46.056
- You realized that everyone

1:04:46.099 --> 1:04:47.927
you just said had a horrible
death.

1:04:52.149 --> 1:04:55.326
[gentle guitar music]

1:05:00.897 --> 1:05:01.810
- Did you hear that?

1:05:01.854 --> 1:05:02.681
- Yeah.

1:05:04.291 --> 1:05:07.468
[gentle guitar music]

1:05:12.082 --> 1:05:13.344
Hey can you play with it?

1:05:17.826 --> 1:05:20.046
[guitar music]

1:05:20.090 --> 1:05:24.224
Yeah. Okay. Keep playing.
I'll be right back.

1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:44.810
[brisk guitar music]

1:05:55.864 --> 1:05:58.563
Pythagoras had this thing
called the Honey of the Spheres.

1:05:58.606 --> 1:06:00.217
Where he believed that the
movement

1:06:00.260 --> 1:06:02.306
of the stars corresponded to
musical notes

1:06:02.349 --> 1:06:05.135
and the musical notes
will make a symphony.

1:06:05.178 --> 1:06:09.052
So play again, but just
really slow because I suck.

1:06:09.095 --> 1:06:10.967
I've only play this thing a few
times.

1:06:12.707 --> 1:06:13.534
- Alright.

1:06:19.932 --> 1:06:22.935
[soft guitar music]

1:06:28.201 --> 1:06:29.898
- All right see. Higher.

1:06:32.336 --> 1:06:34.033
- Actually, I think we might be
good.

1:06:34.077 --> 1:06:37.036
I think we kinda got the,
you know, how it works

1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:39.212
and how this does the whole
thing.

1:06:39.256 --> 1:06:41.693
- I don't think anyone's
gonna buy half a documentary.

1:06:44.087 --> 1:06:45.479
- The thing is pretty heavy.

1:06:46.698 --> 1:06:47.829
- Hey, I really get it,

1:06:49.614 --> 1:06:50.745
we are on to something.

1:06:52.269 --> 1:06:53.748
Just do it for me please.

1:07:02.235 --> 1:07:03.845
Thank you. Alright.

1:07:11.636 --> 1:07:14.726
[rapid guitar music]

1:07:17.990 --> 1:07:21.907
[high pitched electric static]

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:29.654
- Oh, what the fuck.

1:07:31.873 --> 1:07:34.528
[alarm blaring]

1:07:37.314 --> 1:07:39.272
- I mean Beethoven was deaf.

1:07:39.316 --> 1:07:40.665
Are your ears still ringing?

1:07:40.708 --> 1:07:43.581
- My ears are so fucked
they cannot get any worse.

1:07:43.624 --> 1:07:44.538
- Are you in a band or
something.

1:07:44.582 --> 1:07:46.062
- I wish I was in a band.

1:07:46.105 --> 1:07:48.977
I worked the summer at
symphony hall in San Antonio

1:07:49.021 --> 1:07:50.327
and something about the
acoustics there.

1:07:50.370 --> 1:07:52.633
Night after night just
battered my ear drums.

1:07:52.677 --> 1:07:54.287
- Oh man, I would've quit.

1:07:54.331 --> 1:07:56.202
- [Levi] Couldn't quit. It was
my job, I had to pay my rent.

1:07:56.246 --> 1:07:57.421
- Oh yeah, sorry.

1:07:57.464 --> 1:08:01.207
- It was part of another
probation program.

1:08:01.251 --> 1:08:02.121
- Another one?

1:08:08.780 --> 1:08:10.042
- I'm not offended.

1:08:10.086 --> 1:08:11.087
I get, this is really
entertaining for you,

1:08:11.130 --> 1:08:15.439
but this one involves my sister

1:08:15.482 --> 1:08:17.005
and out of respect for her,

1:08:17.049 --> 1:08:20.879
I'd rather just not talk about
it, especially on camera.

1:08:20.922 --> 1:08:22.663
- [John] Oh yeah, yeah. Sorry
about that.

1:08:22.707 --> 1:08:25.057
Yeah. Camera is off.

1:08:25.101 --> 1:08:27.364
So think about every little
thing

1:08:27.407 --> 1:08:29.714
that's taking you to this
moment so far,

1:08:29.757 --> 1:08:31.803
can't change anything by like a
second.

1:08:31.846 --> 1:08:33.283
And we never even meet these
things.

1:08:33.326 --> 1:08:35.459
- No closet, no symbol. No 1908.

1:08:37.461 --> 1:08:40.812
[traffic light beeping]

1:08:43.858 --> 1:08:44.772
That was amazing.

1:08:44.816 --> 1:08:48.167
- Yeah. I mean, what's crazier?

1:08:48.211 --> 1:08:50.213
Believing every single
coincidence you ever see

1:08:50.256 --> 1:08:51.605
or just ignoring them all.

1:08:52.650 --> 1:08:54.956
- In last week. Yeah.
Timing changes everything.

1:08:59.918 --> 1:09:01.876
- I thought this through, stay
with me,

1:09:03.617 --> 1:09:05.489
you and me, our whole lives.

1:09:05.532 --> 1:09:09.623
We've seen all of these movies
and TV shows and video games

1:09:09.667 --> 1:09:13.192
that are basically about
simulations, right.

1:09:13.236 --> 1:09:14.628
And right now,

1:09:14.672 --> 1:09:18.632
me and you are making a film
referencing simulations.

1:09:18.676 --> 1:09:20.330
Isn't this all totally stuff

1:09:20.373 --> 1:09:23.463
that you would program
into your own simulation?

1:09:24.551 --> 1:09:26.423
- So there were these
neuroscientists on it

1:09:26.466 --> 1:09:28.381
that were saying that
unconscious minds

1:09:28.425 --> 1:09:30.035
have their own agendas.

1:09:30.078 --> 1:09:34.996
Maybe the entities are
controlling our unconscious
minds

1:09:35.345 --> 1:09:36.172
in order to get us to do
something

1:09:36.215 --> 1:09:38.217
like that signaling contact,

1:09:38.261 --> 1:09:40.350
but the receivers are our
limbic systems.

1:09:40.393 --> 1:09:44.005
- And then someday someone's
gonna watch this finished film.

1:09:44.049 --> 1:09:46.269
I'll be watching from their
simulations

1:09:46.312 --> 1:09:49.402
and all of their simulations
will collide

1:09:49.446 --> 1:09:51.187
with this simulation right here.

1:09:51.230 --> 1:09:53.798
- I'd say, I just can't figure
out

1:09:53.841 --> 1:09:55.713
what that has to do with the
Pythagorean,

1:09:55.756 --> 1:09:58.063
but I think it's really cool.

1:09:59.804 --> 1:10:02.502
- All right. What you're saying
makes perfect sense, but...

1:10:02.546 --> 1:10:03.373
- What is?

1:10:04.722 --> 1:10:07.203
- Cats, there are these
parasites

1:10:07.246 --> 1:10:08.247
that you can get from cats

1:10:08.291 --> 1:10:10.206
that actually mind control
humans.

1:10:10.249 --> 1:10:12.599
That's totally real. You can
look it up.

1:10:12.643 --> 1:10:14.079
There's cats all around our
buildings

1:10:14.122 --> 1:10:16.473
so we can totally have these
parasites.

1:10:16.516 --> 1:10:19.389
They might be using these
parasites to control us.

1:10:19.432 --> 1:10:22.479
Schizophrenia increased around
the turn of the century,

1:10:22.522 --> 1:10:25.046
which is right around the
cat ownership became common.

1:10:25.090 --> 1:10:26.309
- I've actually got to get to
work.

1:10:26.352 --> 1:10:27.875
We should wrap this up.

1:10:27.919 --> 1:10:28.789
- I mean, we haven't even
checked

1:10:28.833 --> 1:10:29.877
like a third of the grave site.

1:10:29.921 --> 1:10:31.096
- Well, I can't call in sick
again

1:10:31.139 --> 1:10:32.445
chasing down apparently my
shitty theory.

1:10:33.751 --> 1:10:36.406
[ominous music]

1:10:39.583 --> 1:10:40.627
- Yeah. I don't know how you
knew

1:10:45.371 --> 1:10:46.764
that that was my phone number.

1:10:46.807 --> 1:10:49.070
That's a pretty well
coincidence.

1:10:49.114 --> 1:10:50.246
- [John] It's nearly impossible.

1:10:50.289 --> 1:10:51.812
- I mean, statistically it's
impossible

1:10:51.856 --> 1:10:53.292
that coincidences don't happen.

1:10:53.336 --> 1:10:54.598
- [John] You were compelled to
bring

1:10:54.641 --> 1:10:56.861
in Dr. Rita Miller, right?

1:10:56.904 --> 1:10:59.472
A chemistry PhD from UCLA.

1:10:59.516 --> 1:11:00.734
And what was the point
at which you thought,

1:11:00.778 --> 1:11:03.041
"All right, time to
bring in the big guns?"

1:11:03.955 --> 1:11:08.176
- I suspected that there may
be some impaired thinking,

1:11:08.220 --> 1:11:11.789
which is a side effect
of chromium and lead.

1:11:11.832 --> 1:11:13.747
So I referred what I found

1:11:13.791 --> 1:11:16.446
to a chemist that I knew in
undergrad,

1:11:16.489 --> 1:11:20.145
Rita, also her PhD is in music
history,

1:11:20.188 --> 1:11:21.494
It's not in chemistry.

1:11:21.538 --> 1:11:23.714
- I think I would be most
natural.

1:11:25.019 --> 1:11:26.760
It was like, I was doing
something else,

1:11:26.804 --> 1:11:28.066
and then you just walked
up and you're like,

1:11:28.109 --> 1:11:29.676
"Hey, you guys do this
like documentary thing."

1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:31.461
And then you just do it that
way.

1:11:31.504 --> 1:11:34.507
And then we get to the chemist
to drop off soil sample.

1:11:34.551 --> 1:11:36.422
She wants to sign an NDA,

1:11:36.466 --> 1:11:40.383
but it does turn out that her
wife went

1:11:40.426 --> 1:11:42.036
to high school with John's
sister.

1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:43.951
- [John] Hang on, it's
messing up the audio.

1:11:43.995 --> 1:11:47.564
- We get to the chemist to
drop off the soil sample

1:11:47.607 --> 1:11:49.827
and she will not sign an NDA.

1:11:49.870 --> 1:11:51.872
- Hang on you just look like
your picking up lenses...

1:11:51.916 --> 1:11:53.265
- She will not sign an NDA.

1:11:53.309 --> 1:11:54.527
- No, you look like
you're putting up lenses

1:11:54.571 --> 1:11:55.746
and put them down, stop.

1:11:57.878 --> 1:11:59.663
- And she will not sign an NDA,

1:11:59.706 --> 1:12:04.581
but it turns out that high
school had the same name

1:12:04.624 --> 1:12:07.627
as the street that John
found the first symbol.

1:12:08.759 --> 1:12:11.239
And the phenomenon just
dried up. Just stopped.

1:12:14.460 --> 1:12:16.419
- [John] Can we just do
that last little bit,

1:12:16.462 --> 1:12:18.072
but just kind of like dark and
mysterious

1:12:18.116 --> 1:12:20.292
so that you can imagine the
music

1:12:20.336 --> 1:12:22.381
and bite the apple with
finality theme

1:12:22.425 --> 1:12:23.600
so we can cut out on it.

1:12:24.992 --> 1:12:26.385
- Finality. Yeah. Got it.

1:12:26.429 --> 1:12:29.388
And then the phenomenon
just dried up. Just stopped.

1:12:29.432 --> 1:12:31.303
- [John] Wait, can we do
it without the glasses?

1:12:33.436 --> 1:12:36.221
[static humming]

1:12:43.097 --> 1:12:44.969
- Hey, you look cool.

1:12:45.012 --> 1:12:47.754
You are a real smoker. Good at
it.

1:12:51.541 --> 1:12:54.544
[camera shuttering]

1:12:55.545 --> 1:12:59.375
[radio speaking indistinctly]

1:13:01.855 --> 1:13:05.555
I'm a little lighter, which
I have mixed feelings about,

1:13:05.598 --> 1:13:10.255
but maybe a little phenomenon
kicking in.

1:13:10.298 --> 1:13:13.476
[radio speaking indistinctly]

1:13:13.519 --> 1:13:14.433
I admit it.

1:13:16.609 --> 1:13:19.307
[static noises]

1:13:24.312 --> 1:13:27.620
- The radio station is 1908.

1:13:30.841 --> 1:13:33.104
- Radios like that don't
go that high, do they?

1:13:33.147 --> 1:13:34.540
- No, they don't.

1:13:35.846 --> 1:13:36.629
[static noises]

1:13:36.673 --> 1:13:38.196
- Can you record this.

1:13:38.239 --> 1:13:42.461
[static noises from radio]

1:13:42.505 --> 1:13:44.420
- Okay. Just get focus.

1:13:46.683 --> 1:13:48.598
- You are getting it?

1:13:48.641 --> 1:13:50.251
- [Radio] Of this apocalypse
was...

1:13:50.295 --> 1:13:52.297
- Did you roll any of that?

1:13:52.340 --> 1:13:53.864
- I'm rolling now,

1:13:53.907 --> 1:13:57.694
but I'm not really sure
what I'm rolling on,

1:13:57.737 --> 1:14:00.436
but the good news is

1:14:00.479 --> 1:14:04.004
that any time this stuff
happens once it happens twice

1:14:04.048 --> 1:14:06.616
and camera's ready

1:14:06.659 --> 1:14:08.835
and we'll just wait
for it to happen again.

1:14:14.841 --> 1:14:16.974
- And what if it doesn't?

1:14:17.017 --> 1:14:19.672
[ominous music]

1:14:21.108 --> 1:14:25.809
- All right. So it's been a
few weeks since any weird stuff

1:14:27.854 --> 1:14:29.421
so I am thinking, it's time for
me

1:14:29.465 --> 1:14:30.683
to finally get out of the city.

1:14:30.727 --> 1:14:34.513
I just got to tell John, which
is awkward.

1:14:40.388 --> 1:14:42.695
[phone ringing]

1:14:42.739 --> 1:14:44.610
- [John] Hey, I know I'm
supposed

1:14:44.654 --> 1:14:45.481
to legally ask you for consent
to record,

1:14:45.524 --> 1:14:46.394
but this is really,

1:14:47.787 --> 1:14:52.444
It's kinda huge, so just
know it's recording. Cool?

1:14:53.880 --> 1:14:55.316
Yeah. Right.

1:14:55.360 --> 1:14:58.711
Hey man, this is hard to
say, but I'm leaving. I gotta

1:14:58.755 --> 1:15:01.758
be totally up by the first or
they take my security deposit

1:15:01.801 --> 1:15:02.672
[John interrupting]

1:15:02.715 --> 1:15:04.412
- So last night I'm downstairs

1:15:04.456 --> 1:15:09.592
and just helping Lonnie
through a vulnerable moment

1:15:09.635 --> 1:15:10.506
he was having.

1:15:11.594 --> 1:15:12.986
- Is that enough?

1:15:15.641 --> 1:15:16.512
- Yeah.

1:15:19.166 --> 1:15:21.821
- And I look at the apartment
next door

1:15:22.909 --> 1:15:25.608
and here it was, I found it.

1:15:27.348 --> 1:15:28.741
The floating doorway

1:15:28.785 --> 1:15:30.221
and the door was just wide open.

1:15:30.264 --> 1:15:31.570
So I walk in...

1:15:31.614 --> 1:15:33.920
[lock shattering]

1:15:33.964 --> 1:15:35.574
And inside there's just a whole
bunch

1:15:35.618 --> 1:15:37.576
of these strays Sphinx cats,

1:15:39.622 --> 1:15:42.015
And there was this...

1:15:45.192 --> 1:15:46.585
- [Levi] What?

1:15:46.629 --> 1:15:49.283
[ominous music]

1:15:54.201 --> 1:15:59.032
So if they made that
person over there, OD,

1:16:01.382 --> 1:16:03.602
then that's like a sacrifice.

1:16:03.646 --> 1:16:04.777
And it was a sacrifice.

1:16:04.821 --> 1:16:07.388
That means this whole thing is
a ritual.

1:16:08.259 --> 1:16:10.957
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:16:11.001 --> 1:16:12.263
I guess everything started right

1:16:12.306 --> 1:16:14.657
when she OD, so that's
a really good theory.

1:16:15.962 --> 1:16:20.053
- Wait, didn't you say it was

1:16:20.097 --> 1:16:22.882
a guy walking his dog, the
junkie?

1:16:22.926 --> 1:16:24.318
- You ever have a dream

1:16:24.362 --> 1:16:26.930
that you suspect is actually
just a buried memory?

1:16:28.322 --> 1:16:30.716
- I hope not, my dreams are
terrifying.

1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:33.676
[people yelling]

1:16:33.719 --> 1:16:35.895
- I keep on having this
recurring dream

1:16:35.939 --> 1:16:38.419
that I think might have
actually happened to me,

1:16:38.463 --> 1:16:42.510
where I'm a kid and I'm
watching TV.

1:16:43.599 --> 1:16:47.646
There's a symbol in Budapest

1:16:49.256 --> 1:16:52.912
in Middle East, in
somewhere I don't recognize.

1:16:52.956 --> 1:16:55.959
But then I think maybe it's
just my brain being manipulated

1:16:56.002 --> 1:16:58.614
by this place telling me to
figure it out.

1:17:01.007 --> 1:17:01.791
[closet door creaking]

1:17:01.834 --> 1:17:03.096
What's with your closet?

1:17:03.140 --> 1:17:06.230
What's this building?
What's your apartment?

1:17:06.273 --> 1:17:08.754
I mean, jeez, something about
this city,

1:17:08.798 --> 1:17:11.452
maybe like some kind of a
receiver,

1:17:11.496 --> 1:17:13.672
transmitted something
like a satellite dish.

1:17:23.943 --> 1:17:27.294
[Knock on the door]

1:17:33.561 --> 1:17:36.216
[ominous music]

1:17:47.097 --> 1:17:47.924
Check it out.

1:17:54.452 --> 1:17:59.457
Yeah. Okay. This city was
designed according to this
tablet.

1:18:00.153 --> 1:18:02.329
Yeah. See these neighborhoods

1:18:02.373 --> 1:18:06.159
and these parks are all on the
same grid like configuration.

1:18:06.203 --> 1:18:07.595
I mean, I guess in 1908,

1:18:07.639 --> 1:18:10.424
when about when all of those
would have been put up.

1:18:10.468 --> 1:18:12.209
Fred Thompson would have been
supervising

1:18:12.252 --> 1:18:14.037
the planning on that, so...

1:18:15.995 --> 1:18:19.825
- I just checked Quora
and there is no succulent,

1:18:19.869 --> 1:18:23.655
no cactus, not anything
like that, that grows fruit.

1:18:23.699 --> 1:18:25.135
That looks like that.

1:18:28.834 --> 1:18:31.532
[ominous music]

1:18:48.462 --> 1:18:49.725
- I'm gonna try to eat it.

1:18:52.815 --> 1:18:54.642
- Actually pause for a second.

1:18:54.686 --> 1:18:56.862
This dishwasher at work,
he ate this cactus.

1:18:56.906 --> 1:18:59.735
He thought was peyote and
he got this mouth infection

1:18:59.778 --> 1:19:01.301
and they had to remove his jaw.

1:19:03.347 --> 1:19:04.740
- I might be one of the first
people

1:19:04.783 --> 1:19:07.177
in the universe to taste
an inter-dimensional fruit.

1:19:08.047 --> 1:19:11.921
If I died doing that, I'm fine
with that.

1:19:13.226 --> 1:19:15.881
[ominous music]

1:19:25.891 --> 1:19:26.979
- Is that morse code?

1:19:27.980 --> 1:19:31.157
[banging on the door]

1:19:46.564 --> 1:19:49.567
[suspenseful music]

1:20:02.014 --> 1:20:03.537
- Oh my God.

1:20:03.581 --> 1:20:04.408
- What?

1:20:07.890 --> 1:20:09.021
- It's a book.

1:20:11.676 --> 1:20:13.199
- Someone left us a book?

1:20:17.247 --> 1:20:20.816
- The delivery guy left us a
book

1:20:20.859 --> 1:20:23.601
because I bought a book about
the neighborhood on Amazon.

1:20:23.644 --> 1:20:25.995
- Fucking asshole, I
almost stabbed a mailman.

1:20:27.735 --> 1:20:29.999
I found the original
survey of this land parcel.

1:20:30.042 --> 1:20:32.697
And yes, indeed the original
city planners

1:20:32.740 --> 1:20:34.307
did use this shape in order

1:20:34.351 --> 1:20:36.744
to define the real estate
borders.

1:20:36.788 --> 1:20:40.879
Brief glimpse at the history
of this patch of dirt,

1:20:40.923 --> 1:20:43.273
tells us precisely why
they might've done that.

1:20:43.316 --> 1:20:45.884
Did you know that Aldous Huxley
once

1:20:45.928 --> 1:20:48.234
had a Mescalin experience
that was mystical

1:20:48.278 --> 1:20:51.455
and changed his entire
life, just over the hill.

1:20:51.498 --> 1:20:54.414
Jack Parsons of the jet
propulsion laboratory

1:20:54.458 --> 1:20:56.068
and sex magic fame,

1:20:56.112 --> 1:20:58.941
for a very brief time rented
one of these apartments.

1:20:58.984 --> 1:21:01.247
And also if one were to examine
the soil,

1:21:01.291 --> 1:21:04.033
he'd find evidence of a
meteorite strike.

1:21:04.076 --> 1:21:06.600
Might be natural to ask what
exactly

1:21:06.644 --> 1:21:09.603
were the early Pythagorean
city planners doing here.

1:21:10.909 --> 1:21:12.780
Well, it's the same thing as us,

1:21:13.869 --> 1:21:15.087
researching the gateway.

1:21:16.349 --> 1:21:18.786
Gateway or science,

1:21:20.919 --> 1:21:21.789
meets magic.

1:21:24.444 --> 1:21:26.664
[ominous music]

1:21:26.707 --> 1:21:27.491
How's that?

1:21:27.534 --> 1:21:28.796
- That was great.

1:21:28.840 --> 1:21:30.363
I really liked the accent.

1:21:31.974 --> 1:21:33.236
- Was I doing an accent?

1:21:33.279 --> 1:21:35.325
- No it sounds like a
Hobbit. It was awesome.

1:21:36.630 --> 1:21:37.893
- Should we retake it?

1:21:37.936 --> 1:21:38.850
- No, we're great,

1:21:40.373 --> 1:21:43.420
but wait, there's an extra
little piece at the end, right?

1:21:43.463 --> 1:21:45.944
- The part about if we're for,

1:21:45.988 --> 1:21:47.946
I don't think we're gonna use
it.

1:21:47.990 --> 1:21:49.382
And even if we were wrong
about everything else,

1:21:49.426 --> 1:21:54.344
it has always been here,
here in this patch of dirt.

1:21:56.389 --> 1:21:58.565
Actually, by the way I
was thinking about it.

1:21:58.609 --> 1:22:00.698
That should be the title,
"Something in the Dirt",

1:22:00.741 --> 1:22:02.134
not "Something in the Light".

1:22:06.138 --> 1:22:07.531
- You hear that?

1:22:07.574 --> 1:22:10.664
[morse code beeping]

1:22:17.541 --> 1:22:18.542
- That's morse code.

1:22:21.023 --> 1:22:24.069
[morse code beeping]

1:22:30.380 --> 1:22:31.816
- How'd you know which one was
langitude

1:22:31.859 --> 1:22:33.209
and which one was lotitude.

1:22:33.252 --> 1:22:35.385
- Latitude and longitude, and I
didn't.

1:22:36.386 --> 1:22:37.691
If you swap those two
coordinates,

1:22:37.735 --> 1:22:39.432
you end up at Point Nemo,

1:22:39.476 --> 1:22:40.868
the most isolated place on earth

1:22:40.912 --> 1:22:42.827
in the middle of the Pacific
ocean.

1:22:42.870 --> 1:22:44.394
So the place in the middle of
the Pacific

1:22:44.437 --> 1:22:45.569
is gonna be plan B

1:22:45.612 --> 1:22:47.005
and the place that's right near
us

1:22:47.049 --> 1:22:48.702
in the desert is gonna be plan
A.

1:22:49.747 --> 1:22:50.574
- What's this?

1:22:52.054 --> 1:22:53.055
I thought you said you had this
book

1:22:53.098 --> 1:22:54.447
since you were a teenager.

1:22:56.972 --> 1:23:00.888
- I did. I just got it
reprinted when we needed it,

1:23:00.932 --> 1:23:02.760
because it was kind of falling
apart.

1:23:06.677 --> 1:23:07.852
- Really?

1:23:07.895 --> 1:23:10.507
- Yeah. Stop being paranoid.
It's weird.

1:23:11.508 --> 1:23:14.163
[ominous music]

1:24:31.327 --> 1:24:33.938
[static noise]

1:24:51.738 --> 1:24:54.393
[ominous music]

1:25:20.898 --> 1:25:24.075
[shrill static noise]

1:25:49.361 --> 1:25:52.538
I was wondering if maybe
that's sacrifice next door.

1:25:52.582 --> 1:25:53.670
Maybe that's the quartz

1:25:53.713 --> 1:25:55.411
and the building is foundation
needs.

1:25:57.282 --> 1:26:02.244
Blood, like life energy in
order to carry the signals

1:26:02.287 --> 1:26:04.681
that communicate with the mind
parasites.

1:26:04.724 --> 1:26:07.423
I know sounds kind of nuts,
but I'm just riffing here.

1:26:09.076 --> 1:26:10.687
You want to get back on the
road.

1:26:10.730 --> 1:26:13.820
- Yeah. This is the same zip
code

1:26:13.864 --> 1:26:16.083
as the beach I spear fish at,

1:26:16.127 --> 1:26:21.088
and that is the beach
which I spear fish at.

1:26:24.266 --> 1:26:26.006
- I don't know it kind of looks
like

1:26:26.050 --> 1:26:27.617
It could be a beach
anywhere though, right?

1:26:33.797 --> 1:26:35.102
- It really looks like it.

1:26:36.713 --> 1:26:38.149
- I am just trying to make
sure that we stay on track

1:26:38.193 --> 1:26:39.498
so we get the right answer.

1:26:40.369 --> 1:26:43.676
"Speed is fine, but accuracy is
final."

1:26:46.157 --> 1:26:47.202
Wyatt Earp said that.

1:26:56.298 --> 1:26:59.083
- Okay. Hi, I'm Michael.

1:26:59.126 --> 1:27:00.476
I was brought in later in

1:27:00.519 --> 1:27:03.261
the whole process of the
documentary

1:27:03.305 --> 1:27:04.741
because the edit was getting.

1:27:05.742 --> 1:27:07.265
Basically John empowered me

1:27:07.309 --> 1:27:08.919
to give my point of view.

1:27:08.962 --> 1:27:10.964
You know, the one that he
couldn't see,

1:27:11.008 --> 1:27:11.965
keep it objective.

1:27:14.054 --> 1:27:16.361
At first I thought if we
all trusted each other

1:27:17.667 --> 1:27:18.755
and the checks cleared

1:27:20.322 --> 1:27:22.628
and that's when John was in
control

1:27:22.672 --> 1:27:24.587
and it was what it was.

1:27:27.067 --> 1:27:29.113
But then after the radiation
incident.

1:27:30.419 --> 1:27:33.030
[static noise]

1:27:36.338 --> 1:27:39.297
[suspenseful music]

1:27:40.472 --> 1:27:43.170
[ominous music]

1:28:40.271 --> 1:28:42.012
- All right. First things first,

1:28:42.055 --> 1:28:43.448
I need you to stay calm

1:28:43.492 --> 1:28:46.103
because I have this completely
under control, okay?

1:28:46.146 --> 1:28:47.757
- What's up John?

1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:49.976
- The electromagnetic spectrum
does not end in visible light

1:28:50.020 --> 1:28:53.328
and infrared, there's also
the UV part of the spectrum.

1:28:53.371 --> 1:28:54.590
And I have a sunburn

1:28:54.633 --> 1:28:56.635
that was caused by ultraviolet
rays, look.

1:28:59.943 --> 1:29:01.466
That could be x-ray radiation.

1:29:01.510 --> 1:29:03.250
We might've been walking around
in gamma rays for months.

1:29:03.294 --> 1:29:04.339
It mutated that plant,

1:29:04.382 --> 1:29:06.297
who knows what it's doing to
our DNA.

1:29:06.341 --> 1:29:07.951
We might not even be human
anymore.

1:29:10.606 --> 1:29:11.781
[Levi mumbling]

1:29:11.824 --> 1:29:14.523
Now have constructed this
radiation suit

1:29:14.566 --> 1:29:15.959
because we can't let building
management

1:29:16.002 --> 1:29:17.482
sending the EMF inspector

1:29:17.526 --> 1:29:19.658
and I closed all the
windows just to be safe.

1:29:19.702 --> 1:29:22.574
So, give it a look.

1:29:26.186 --> 1:29:29.755
[radiation suite rustling]

1:30:28.292 --> 1:30:30.947
[ominous music]

1:30:37.214 --> 1:30:38.041
It cooked the plant.

1:30:39.477 --> 1:30:40.304
What's with the skull?

1:30:41.523 --> 1:30:44.351
- So I downloaded geocache app

1:30:44.395 --> 1:30:47.616
and I put in the zip code
from the redacted manuscript

1:30:48.530 --> 1:30:51.576
and coordinates came up for
the beach that I Spearfish at.

1:30:51.620 --> 1:30:55.711
And I swam down in the
reef and I found that guy.

1:30:57.364 --> 1:30:58.191
- You did that?

1:31:03.066 --> 1:31:04.633
- Well, you know, you're not
supposed

1:31:04.676 --> 1:31:05.721
to keep geocaches catches,
right?

1:31:05.764 --> 1:31:07.157
- I know, I just figured since

1:31:07.200 --> 1:31:09.768
it was probably relevant
to what we're doing, but...

1:31:12.641 --> 1:31:13.772
[Levi chuckling]

1:31:13.816 --> 1:31:16.601
Wait, you keep geocaches all
the time.

1:31:16.645 --> 1:31:18.429
- How is a fake scull relevant.

1:31:24.217 --> 1:31:26.829
- How do you know it's a fake
skull?

1:31:28.091 --> 1:31:30.397
- You cooked the fucking hard
drives.

1:31:30.441 --> 1:31:32.487
- We both cooked the fucking
hard drives.

1:31:33.923 --> 1:31:35.272
- You are the video...

1:31:35.315 --> 1:31:39.406
[both arguing indistinctly]

1:31:39.450 --> 1:31:41.452
You are the fucking video
organizer.

1:31:41.496 --> 1:31:43.585
And I told you a million
fucking times,

1:31:43.628 --> 1:31:44.847
to open the windows.

1:31:45.891 --> 1:31:46.805
- Was I supposed to do man?

1:31:46.849 --> 1:31:48.459
Just let radiation billow out

1:31:48.503 --> 1:31:50.766
all over Laurel Canyon like
Chernobyl.

1:31:50.809 --> 1:31:52.071
- There is no radiation.

1:31:52.115 --> 1:31:53.725
And you left the hard drives
next

1:31:53.769 --> 1:31:56.293
to the hottest place in the
whole fucking apartment.

1:31:56.336 --> 1:32:00.297
- They're not all cooked.
We'll just recreate something.

1:32:00.340 --> 1:32:04.431
[speaking in a foreign language]

1:32:40.859 --> 1:32:42.295
- As soon as I talked to him,

1:32:42.339 --> 1:32:44.297
he said, okay, this is all real.

1:32:44.341 --> 1:32:46.386
What I need you to redo,

1:32:46.430 --> 1:32:47.518
and whatever the fuck that
means,

1:32:47.562 --> 1:32:49.694
and what really sucks was that
Stefania

1:32:49.738 --> 1:32:52.523
was like this we are not going
to give them the footage.

1:32:52.567 --> 1:32:54.090
until we get paid.

1:32:54.133 --> 1:32:56.614
I'd personally hold onto that
footage

1:32:56.658 --> 1:32:59.225
until they get paid and we got
fired.

1:32:59.269 --> 1:33:03.099
And now we're on what would
be the sixth editor, seven?

1:33:03.142 --> 1:33:03.969
How many is it?

1:33:05.405 --> 1:33:08.147
[door unlocking]

1:33:13.936 --> 1:33:15.720
- I thought you're working
tonight.

1:33:15.764 --> 1:33:18.201
My carbon monoxide detector
went off

1:33:18.244 --> 1:33:19.637
and I'm gonna have someone take
a look

1:33:19.681 --> 1:33:20.899
at it tomorrow morning,

1:33:20.943 --> 1:33:22.379
but in the meantime,
it's for my own safety,

1:33:22.422 --> 1:33:24.816
I'm gonna stay on up here
tonight.

1:33:24.860 --> 1:33:26.992
- Actually, I'm not working
tonight

1:33:27.036 --> 1:33:28.690
and I kinda need my spot.

1:33:32.824 --> 1:33:35.566
- I mean, maybe I could
just stay in the bedroom.

1:33:35.610 --> 1:33:37.133
If you're gonna stay out here.

1:33:39.614 --> 1:33:43.356
[radio humming indistinctly]

1:33:57.240 --> 1:34:00.156
[ceremonial music]

1:34:40.457 --> 1:34:41.980
- Welcome back.

1:34:42.024 --> 1:34:45.462
[rapid ceremonial music]

1:34:48.378 --> 1:34:52.295
[diminishing ceremonial music]

1:34:58.562 --> 1:35:00.564
- Is it the biggest fluctuation
yet.

1:35:03.045 --> 1:35:05.874
[ground rumbling]

1:35:13.055 --> 1:35:18.147
I'm telling you, man, this
can be really dangerous.

1:35:18.190 --> 1:35:19.191
This structure could be...

1:35:19.235 --> 1:35:20.932
- Every building in LA since
1978

1:35:20.976 --> 1:35:22.673
has been retrofitted for
earthquakes.

1:35:22.717 --> 1:35:25.807
Come on, they are back, come on.

1:35:41.997 --> 1:35:44.042
Thought it would be a kind of a
big night

1:35:44.086 --> 1:35:46.175
at the bar, right? New Year's?

1:35:47.176 --> 1:35:48.003
- I got fired.

1:35:49.004 --> 1:35:50.222
- Really?

1:35:50.266 --> 1:35:52.050
- Yeah. And if we're
gonna keep taking beers,

1:35:52.094 --> 1:35:53.878
will you please replenish
them like I asked

1:35:53.922 --> 1:35:55.227
to replenish fucking times.

1:35:55.271 --> 1:35:56.141
- I'm sure you're gonna find

1:35:56.185 --> 1:35:57.708
another bartending gig, right?

1:35:57.752 --> 1:35:58.970
- I liked my job and bartending
jobs

1:35:59.014 --> 1:36:01.190
are insanely hard to find in
Los Angeles.

1:36:03.366 --> 1:36:04.933
I'm leaving anyways. Fuck it.

1:36:08.675 --> 1:36:10.112
- Wait, you're still gonna go.

1:36:12.418 --> 1:36:14.638
Thread just picked up,
you're just gonna go?

1:36:16.553 --> 1:36:17.989
- I don't have a thread.

1:36:18.033 --> 1:36:20.818
You have a thread and hoax
skeletons

1:36:20.862 --> 1:36:22.951
and non-existent radiation
aren't part of it.

1:36:22.994 --> 1:36:24.430
This new stuff doesn't add up.

1:36:25.823 --> 1:36:27.346
Better explanations will be

1:36:27.390 --> 1:36:29.261
that you got fucking brain
damage from reduced gravity.

1:36:29.305 --> 1:36:32.047
- Do you think that maybe you
blame random shit on gravity,

1:36:32.090 --> 1:36:33.265
because you don't want
to bother to figure out

1:36:33.309 --> 1:36:34.484
what's really going on?

1:36:40.533 --> 1:36:41.317
- Why do you do that?

1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:42.274
- Do what Levi?

1:36:44.581 --> 1:36:48.541
- Somehow everything
everyone else says as absurd,

1:36:48.585 --> 1:36:49.412
but fucking...

1:36:52.415 --> 1:36:55.070
[ominous music]

1:36:57.681 --> 1:37:01.163
[rapid suspenseful music]

1:37:05.994 --> 1:37:08.257
- Roll the security camera.

1:37:13.088 --> 1:37:14.176
- It's glitching again it's
frozen.

1:37:14.219 --> 1:37:15.177
- You got to restart it in

1:37:15.220 --> 1:37:16.047
the playback part of the app.

1:37:16.091 --> 1:37:16.918
- No shit.

1:37:33.021 --> 1:37:33.848
What's this?

1:37:36.024 --> 1:37:38.548
- Came in and it looked
like your bag had exploded.

1:37:38.591 --> 1:37:40.202
So I cleaned up your mess.

1:37:40.245 --> 1:37:42.552
- Weird because it looks like
you're going through my shit.

1:37:43.945 --> 1:37:46.556
- Yeah. I accidentally
saw some legal documents

1:37:46.599 --> 1:37:48.601
and sure I suppose that you're
not

1:37:48.645 --> 1:37:50.734
what most people would think
of as a real sex offender.

1:37:50.777 --> 1:37:53.084
But what you are is a person

1:37:53.128 --> 1:37:56.783
who helped his sister
rob construction sites.

1:37:58.133 --> 1:37:59.395
And I'm pretty sure your license

1:37:59.438 --> 1:38:01.658
is suspended for some
unpaid parking tickets.

1:38:06.793 --> 1:38:10.319
- All right, here's what
happened.

1:38:12.756 --> 1:38:14.889
I was helping her get back
something

1:38:14.932 --> 1:38:16.934
that she said was hers.

1:38:16.978 --> 1:38:19.676
And that was probably a
really stupid thing to do.

1:38:20.764 --> 1:38:23.158
But I did it because I felt
guilty

1:38:23.201 --> 1:38:25.377
about giving her her first bump.

1:38:27.902 --> 1:38:30.948
And I have no idea why I'm
explaining

1:38:30.992 --> 1:38:32.863
this to an asshole extremist

1:38:32.907 --> 1:38:34.865
who lives off of with his
ex-husband.

1:38:34.909 --> 1:38:36.171
- You know what it makes
a whole lot of sense

1:38:36.214 --> 1:38:38.347
that you turned your sister
into a junkie.

1:38:40.131 --> 1:38:41.045
Did that kill her?

1:38:42.438 --> 1:38:45.441
[suspenseful music]

1:38:51.316 --> 1:38:52.927
Yeah. Go ahead and record this.

1:38:54.406 --> 1:38:57.061
[ominous music]

1:39:03.415 --> 1:39:05.722
You know why I think you're
leaving?

1:39:05.765 --> 1:39:07.811
It's because you are allergic
to success.

1:39:09.030 --> 1:39:09.987
You're a fuck up.

1:39:11.684 --> 1:39:14.383
And you wear it like some
kind of a badge of honor

1:39:14.426 --> 1:39:15.645
and you dress like a child

1:39:15.688 --> 1:39:17.734
so that nobody ever
expects anything of you.

1:39:18.865 --> 1:39:20.041
To be really honest.

1:39:20.084 --> 1:39:21.999
I think if we actually found
some success

1:39:22.043 --> 1:39:24.175
in this thing we're trying to
do,

1:39:24.219 --> 1:39:25.916
you'd find a way to fuck that
up.

1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:28.571
- What have you had the success
at?

1:39:28.614 --> 1:39:32.096
Actually don't tell me,
I don't give a shit.

1:39:32.140 --> 1:39:33.663
I'm just fascinated that in
addition

1:39:33.706 --> 1:39:35.752
to being an unemployed
arrogant, fascist,

1:39:35.795 --> 1:39:38.015
you're also a compulsive liar.

1:39:38.059 --> 1:39:39.277
- Actually I've made more money

1:39:39.321 --> 1:39:40.844
than you've ever seen in your
entire life.

1:39:40.887 --> 1:39:42.585
- John you're a scooter
wrangler.

1:39:42.628 --> 1:39:44.674
- And you are the oldest
bartender in LA,

1:39:45.631 --> 1:39:47.024
I bet your parents are
really proud of that.

1:39:47.068 --> 1:39:49.505
- Wait, what did you
do with all that money?

1:39:49.548 --> 1:39:50.375
- I donated it.

1:39:50.419 --> 1:39:51.376
- To who? To what?

1:39:51.420 --> 1:39:52.508
- To my church.

1:39:58.601 --> 1:39:59.994
- You're right, I'm a fuck up,

1:40:00.037 --> 1:40:04.389
but at least I'm not a gullible
fraud.

1:40:04.433 --> 1:40:06.957
I mean, you put away the courts
collection

1:40:07.001 --> 1:40:09.481
and the snake skins before
I come over at least

1:40:09.525 --> 1:40:13.746
and hide the receipts for
the shit you fabricated.

1:40:13.790 --> 1:40:16.445
[ominous music]

1:40:18.838 --> 1:40:19.839
- You know I think I just
realized

1:40:19.883 --> 1:40:21.276
that I'm glad that you're
leaving

1:40:22.277 --> 1:40:24.627
because the only reason
I'm doing this with you

1:40:24.670 --> 1:40:26.411
is because you just happened to
pay rent

1:40:26.455 --> 1:40:28.718
on this stupid place by
coincidence.

1:40:31.634 --> 1:40:34.289
It really upsets me to watch
you deceive yourself thinking

1:40:34.332 --> 1:40:36.813
that it's gonna be any
better where you're going,

1:40:37.814 --> 1:40:39.033
because you don't realize

1:40:39.076 --> 1:40:40.817
that you still have to
live with being you.

1:40:45.691 --> 1:40:48.781
You're a fuck up. You're a
criminal.

1:40:50.479 --> 1:40:51.567
And you have a low IQ.

1:40:53.786 --> 1:40:56.789
[suspenseful music]

1:41:06.103 --> 1:41:08.105
- Sometimes I wonder if these
two things

1:41:08.149 --> 1:41:09.541
are just like you and me,

1:41:09.585 --> 1:41:12.022
like one of them
manipulating the other one

1:41:12.066 --> 1:41:14.720
and one in this rabbit hole to
nowhere.

1:41:14.764 --> 1:41:15.895
And the other one just comes

1:41:15.939 --> 1:41:18.594
to simply going along with it

1:41:22.163 --> 1:41:27.211
because he just wants to
believe in something different

1:41:27.255 --> 1:41:29.387
than his actual life.

1:41:32.521 --> 1:41:34.653
- Maybe the complicit one's
life wouldn't be so shitty

1:41:34.697 --> 1:41:37.178
if he was smart enough to
dig his own rabbit hole.

1:41:39.049 --> 1:41:41.704
Maybe the gravity one shouldn't
blame

1:41:41.747 --> 1:41:43.575
the electromagnetism one for
the fact

1:41:43.619 --> 1:41:44.881
that he was a piece of a long
time

1:41:44.924 --> 1:41:45.969
before they ever met.

1:41:52.018 --> 1:41:53.498
- Shit I just realized,

1:41:56.458 --> 1:41:57.850
you're neither one of them,

1:41:59.287 --> 1:42:03.291
but best here, whatever is
slithering in the ceiling,

1:42:03.334 --> 1:42:05.728
just a big fucking reptile.

1:42:09.645 --> 1:42:11.473
I am done. Get the fuck out.

1:42:25.226 --> 1:42:27.793
[static noise]

1:42:58.563 --> 1:43:02.219
[dog barking at a distance]

1:43:06.049 --> 1:43:09.357
[footsteps approaching]

1:43:21.673 --> 1:43:26.200
- If it helps, I felt that
quake down in the garage.

1:43:37.559 --> 1:43:39.038
- That was a real earthquake?

1:43:56.708 --> 1:43:58.101
You and me aren't friends.

1:43:59.581 --> 1:44:02.758
I mean, I don't have
any friends or family.

1:44:04.977 --> 1:44:06.849
I still wouldn't choose
to spend time with you

1:44:06.892 --> 1:44:09.155
if we weren't working
on this thing together,

1:44:10.809 --> 1:44:14.857
that said it's a lot easier to
believe

1:44:15.988 --> 1:44:19.340
that someone is pure
evil when in actuality,

1:44:20.689 --> 1:44:23.387
it's really unlikely
that either one of us is.

1:44:25.389 --> 1:44:27.696
- Well. I don't know.

1:44:27.739 --> 1:44:28.697
One of us could be.

1:44:30.351 --> 1:44:35.312
- Either way. I want all
these threads to add up,

1:44:40.143 --> 1:44:41.623
but there's just more threads.

1:44:44.539 --> 1:44:48.804
- All right.

1:44:53.069 --> 1:44:55.767
Tomorrow morning, oh jeez,
I guess in a few hours,

1:44:57.291 --> 1:44:59.684
I'll have somebody come take a
look

1:44:59.728 --> 1:45:01.164
at the apartment and if it's
safe,

1:45:01.207 --> 1:45:05.516
you and I can hold up down
there until you move on

1:45:05.560 --> 1:45:06.604
to wherever you're going.

1:45:06.648 --> 1:45:08.737
And I'll just stay in my car
tonight.

1:45:08.780 --> 1:45:10.913
- No, you're probably right

1:45:10.956 --> 1:45:13.437
if this place is gonna
sink into the ground

1:45:13.481 --> 1:45:14.308
it would've already.

1:45:14.351 --> 1:45:15.961
I'll sleep on this guy.

1:45:16.005 --> 1:45:17.398
Shove it in there just to be
safe,

1:45:17.441 --> 1:45:18.703
you can take my room.

1:45:20.052 --> 1:45:21.053
- All right.

1:45:36.721 --> 1:45:37.548
Hey.

1:45:43.815 --> 1:45:45.774
Can I have a second beer to
help me sleep?

1:45:53.172 --> 1:45:55.740
[loud banging]

1:46:02.268 --> 1:46:05.663
[John breathing heavily]

1:47:56.034 --> 1:47:59.690
[helicopter engine roaring]

1:48:01.257 --> 1:48:02.606
Tornado could explain it.

1:48:05.391 --> 1:48:08.090
There was one here in
Los Angeles once in 1908.

1:48:14.357 --> 1:48:17.403
I like to think that he's out
there somewhere still though,

1:48:17.447 --> 1:48:20.668
you know, sitting by a
pool, sipping on a brew,

1:48:21.756 --> 1:48:24.759
talking the ear off some
stranger with like tall tale

1:48:24.802 --> 1:48:26.587
or a fishing story or something.

1:48:28.284 --> 1:48:30.199
In Idaho or Tucson

1:48:30.242 --> 1:48:32.375
or wherever his lease
started the next morning.

1:48:34.638 --> 1:48:37.249
[somber music]

1:48:40.470 --> 1:48:41.689
But, he is not.

1:48:42.733 --> 1:48:45.910
[somber music]

1:48:45.954 --> 1:48:50.872
They gave me this little box
this plastic urn of his ashes.

1:48:52.134 --> 1:48:54.310
And I tried to find some family

1:48:54.353 --> 1:48:56.442
or friends to give it to,

1:48:56.486 --> 1:48:58.967
but he wasn't lying there was
no one.

1:49:00.185 --> 1:49:02.579
I mean, his parents died a
decade ago.

1:49:03.493 --> 1:49:07.192
His little sister was on
something

1:49:07.236 --> 1:49:08.672
that night at the construction
site.

1:49:08.716 --> 1:49:10.544
And she slipped.

1:49:13.764 --> 1:49:17.376
But I honestly think that
he's up there thanking God,

1:49:17.420 --> 1:49:19.988
that he got to be part
of something profound

1:49:20.031 --> 1:49:21.903
to break up his mundane
existence.

1:49:23.034 --> 1:49:24.340
I mean, we should all hope

1:49:25.646 --> 1:49:29.084
to be able to do something
important

1:49:29.127 --> 1:49:30.564
like that before we die.

1:49:41.749 --> 1:49:43.228
You got to keep rolling.

1:49:43.272 --> 1:49:44.490
I know you gotta get going.

1:49:44.534 --> 1:49:47.015
- [Interviewer] I'm
actually on my way out.

1:49:47.058 --> 1:49:48.756
I need to prep the disks

1:49:48.799 --> 1:49:52.803
for whoever is gonna take my
place now.

1:49:52.847 --> 1:49:53.674
I got to go.

1:49:55.414 --> 1:49:56.633
- Yeah, most people end up
feeling a little too close to
it.

1:49:56.677 --> 1:49:57.895
That makes sense.

1:49:57.939 --> 1:49:59.331
You got any burning questions

1:49:59.375 --> 1:50:00.985
for me you on your way out?

1:50:01.029 --> 1:50:03.945
- [Interviewer] Actually just
the same as everyone I guess.

1:50:03.988 --> 1:50:04.815
What happened?

1:50:06.164 --> 1:50:09.603
- You know, there is worst ways
to die

1:50:09.646 --> 1:50:12.214
than floating away in zero
gravity.

1:50:13.128 --> 1:50:14.172
I bet he just froze to death

1:50:14.216 --> 1:50:15.957
or suffocated up in the
atmosphere,

1:50:16.827 --> 1:50:18.133
long time before even starting
falling.

1:50:18.176 --> 1:50:20.091
I mean I don't even
think he felt the impact.

1:50:20.135 --> 1:50:21.179
- [Interviewer] No, I mean,

1:50:21.223 --> 1:50:23.051
what do you think happened here?

1:50:24.879 --> 1:50:28.491
With all the phenomenon and all
that?

1:50:34.323 --> 1:50:36.586
- There was something like seven
different William Thompsons

1:50:36.630 --> 1:50:38.327
in early 20th century Los
Angeles.

1:50:43.898 --> 1:50:45.943
Some of my figures were off.

1:50:51.645 --> 1:50:53.124
- [Interviewer] Which figures?

1:50:59.435 --> 1:51:00.958
- Some of them.

1:51:01.002 --> 1:51:03.221
[somber music]

1:51:03.265 --> 1:51:08.270
- I think among all the
dramatizations and visual
effects.

1:51:10.054 --> 1:51:11.839
I still believe part of it was
real.

1:51:13.536 --> 1:51:17.583
I don't think anyone can say
which part at this point, but

1:51:22.588 --> 1:51:23.546
something happened.

1:51:43.784 --> 1:51:44.872
- So, I couldn't find any
evidence

1:51:44.915 --> 1:51:46.569
of the Pythagorean brotherhoods.

1:51:48.266 --> 1:51:49.485
So I couldn't find any evidence

1:51:49.528 --> 1:51:51.095
of the Pythagorean brotherhood.

1:51:53.968 --> 1:51:55.491
So I couldn't find any evidence

1:51:55.534 --> 1:51:58.015
of the Pythagorean brotherhood
being active in centuries,

1:51:58.886 --> 1:52:01.802
but that's the point of
a secret society, right?

1:52:02.803 --> 1:52:05.675
It's secret. You can't see it.

1:52:07.677 --> 1:52:10.114
It's like electricity.

1:52:10.985 --> 1:52:13.770
Can't see that, but you know it
has power.

1:52:23.475 --> 1:52:25.739
So, you know, I'm not done.

1:52:32.093 --> 1:52:33.355
Find the pattern.

1:52:36.488 --> 1:52:38.012
When you're at the center of it.

1:52:40.492 --> 1:52:41.319
It all fits.

1:52:48.022 --> 1:52:48.936
Eventually.

1:52:52.766 --> 1:52:56.073
[bells jingling softly]

1:53:01.426 --> 1:53:03.211
You hear that?

1:53:03.254 --> 1:53:06.605
[bells jingling softly]

1:53:46.254 --> 1:53:49.344
[ceremonial humming]

1:54:21.419 --> 1:54:26.076
[progressive gentle
instrumental music]
