00:09.130 --> 00:11.660
"Shanshu."

00:12.730 --> 00:14.900
"Shanshu."

00:16.329 --> 00:19.170
Or maybe it's "shushan."

00:19.929 --> 00:23.370
Why is it taking you so long
to figure out that word?

00:24.730 --> 00:28.699
I don't know. The prophecies were
written over the last 4000 years...

00:29.530 --> 00:32.509
...in a dozen languages,
some of which aren't human!.

00:33.130 --> 00:37.380
Let's get a demon to suck my brain
out. That would speed things up.

00:39.130 --> 00:40.670
He's testy while translating.

00:40.929 --> 00:44.369
It's pivotal to what it prophesies
for the vampire with a soul.

00:45.130 --> 00:48.820
Hurry and find out about Angel.
I want to know what it says about me.

00:49.929 --> 00:53.159
If there is torrid romance
in my future, massive wealth.

00:53.530 --> 00:55.530
I'll settle for enviable fame.

00:55.929 --> 00:58.840
It's an ancient sacred text,
not a Magic 8-Ball.

01:01.329 --> 01:04.379
- Nobody gets my humor.
- I thought it was funny.

01:04.930 --> 01:05.700
Oh.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074

01:19.329 --> 01:20.560
Hey, guys?

01:21.129 --> 01:23.799
Remember the lawyer who wanted out
of Wolfram and Hart?

01:24.730 --> 01:27.329
- Lindsey?
- They promoted him.

01:28.329 --> 01:29.239
Junior partner.

01:30.730 --> 01:34.379
After all you did, he sells
his soul for 30 pieces of silver.

01:34.930 --> 01:38.230
Actually, he sold it for a six-figure
salary and a benefits package.

01:40.930 --> 01:44.019
It's disappointing.
He had an opportunity to change.

01:45.129 --> 01:46.069
He didn't take it.

01:54.730 --> 01:55.810
What?

01:57.129 --> 01:58.879
A little late for visitors.

02:13.930 --> 02:16.000
- Mr. Nabbit?
- David?

02:16.930 --> 02:17.800
Heart in my throat.

02:18.129 --> 02:20.409
- I'm sorry.
- That was awesome.

02:22.330 --> 02:23.340
Can we do it again?

02:23.530 --> 02:25.490
Are you-- Do you need help?

02:25.930 --> 02:27.819
Me? No, I just popped by to hang.

02:28.330 --> 02:31.069
I blew off a meeting.
Tonight I'm dungeon master.

02:32.530 --> 02:34.669
- What do you think of my cape?
- Shiny.

02:36.729 --> 02:37.960
You guys want to hang?

02:40.330 --> 02:42.150
Oh, wow, wow, wow.

02:49.930 --> 02:52.030
This is where it all happens.

02:52.330 --> 02:54.789
They're helpless, in agony.

02:55.930 --> 02:59.259
They have no one to turn to
so they come here to you.

02:59.530 --> 03:02.479
Drink that coffee, sit on this couch.

03:03.729 --> 03:06.990
Unspeakable fiends of hell
hot on their heels.

03:10.930 --> 03:15.280
What did I do today? Spun off my
digital-pager network, made a million.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.509
All right, several. Big whoop.
What does that mean?

03:21.729 --> 03:23.800
No more shopping in the PennySaver?

03:25.930 --> 03:27.580
It's just, you guys...

03:27.729 --> 03:31.139
...your lives are so
meaningful, so exciting.

03:32.530 --> 03:36.430
You fight demons! One could
walk right through that door!

03:47.530 --> 03:49.319
You seen any cool demons lately?

03:49.330 --> 03:52.490
This hallowed ground is made
ready. His time is at hand.

03:53.530 --> 03:58.099
For as it was written, he of pure
darkness shall come into light.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.670
Welcome. I hope
you had a pleasant journey.

05:34.610 --> 05:36.079
You, you guys are....

05:39.410 --> 05:41.899
I never know
what's going to happen here.

05:47.209 --> 05:48.750
- Good to see you.
- You too.

05:49.009 --> 05:50.899
- Drop by again.
- We'll hang soon.

05:55.009 --> 05:56.060
I know what it means.

05:56.209 --> 05:58.910
A very wealthy man with
just no life at all?

05:59.810 --> 06:01.250
No. The word in the scroll.

06:04.009 --> 06:06.750
- That "shoe-shine" thing?
- Shanshu.

06:08.810 --> 06:12.319
If it isn't Phygian but descends
from the ancient Magyars...

06:13.009 --> 06:14.970
...then the root is Proto-Ugaric.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.939
In which case it would mean....

06:20.209 --> 06:21.470
We're waiting.

06:23.209 --> 06:24.399
Death.

06:25.009 --> 06:27.779
You said it was about
the vampire with the soul.

06:32.810 --> 06:34.350
Angel's going to die?

06:35.810 --> 06:37.319
Oh. Anything else?

06:38.810 --> 06:42.670
He took that well. Is this
a good time to talk about my raise?

06:43.610 --> 06:46.939
It's probably years off,
after the coming battles.

06:47.810 --> 06:49.040
My raise?

06:50.810 --> 06:53.199
Apocalyptic prophecies
aren't a science.

06:54.410 --> 06:58.480
And I could be way off the mark
so no reason to be concerned.

07:01.610 --> 07:03.709
So it's good you're not concerned.

07:05.209 --> 07:07.310
Not even remotely concerned.

07:17.209 --> 07:19.949
- Pain...killer.
- Painful, killer demon.

07:20.810 --> 07:22.350
Painkiller!

07:25.009 --> 07:28.519
A woman. Judging by the bag
on her head, I'm guessing homeless.

07:29.810 --> 07:31.740
- Versus a slime demon.
- Where?

07:32.209 --> 07:35.509
I smelled something awful,
that would be the slime demon...

07:38.209 --> 07:41.300
...who lives behind a waste
treatment plant in El Segundo.

07:41.810 --> 07:44.829
- Do you need--
- Stay here and take care of her.

07:48.410 --> 07:50.899
- Enough with the smelly visions!
- Here we are.

07:52.009 --> 07:56.329
Thanks. If I ever meet The Powers
That Be, I'll punch them in the nose!

07:59.810 --> 08:01.209
You think they have a nose?

08:03.569 --> 08:05.850
You lost the scroll of Aberjian?

08:06.569 --> 08:10.259
- It was stolen from our vault.
- We need it for the raising.

08:10.769 --> 08:14.250
- We understand.
- It was my mistake. I'll fix it.

08:14.970 --> 08:19.009
You will do nothing. I will retrieve
the scroll myself. Who stole it?

08:23.370 --> 08:25.300
- Angel.
- Angel.

08:26.370 --> 08:28.470
I am summoned for the raising...

08:28.769 --> 08:30.839
...the thing that was
to bring him to us...

08:31.170 --> 08:34.360
...tear him from The Powers
That Be, and he has the scroll?

08:35.970 --> 08:37.480
We're aware of the irony.

08:37.769 --> 08:41.139
He possesses the prophecies.
His connection is complete.

08:41.970 --> 08:45.549
- He hasn't had time to study the text.
- No, and he won't.

08:46.169 --> 08:50.210
Access to The Powers shall be cut off
from him and the scroll returned.

08:50.970 --> 08:53.220
- What can we do to help?
- Leave it to me.

08:59.970 --> 09:01.789
Well, end of discussion.

09:07.769 --> 09:10.649
Told you. She listens
to the nut calls on her scanner.

09:11.370 --> 09:13.649
Sure she doesn't use her brain chip?

09:16.169 --> 09:20.669
Detective, there was a lot of
"otherworldly howling and wailing."

09:20.970 --> 09:23.360
Something about something slimy
dragging a woman.

09:24.570 --> 09:26.320
I heard the call. Stay here.

09:26.970 --> 09:29.600
- You want backup, detective?
- Or a Ouija board?

09:53.370 --> 09:55.580
You turn your back
and they come for you.

09:55.769 --> 09:58.470
- You're safe now.
- You sliced him up real good.

10:00.570 --> 10:02.460
He saved me from one of their spies.

10:02.970 --> 10:06.940
I don't appreciate the dental
association watching me like that.

10:10.169 --> 10:11.500
- Hi.
- What was it?

10:12.570 --> 10:14.779
- It won't hurt anyone else.
- What was it?

10:16.769 --> 10:18.309
Slime demon.

10:19.769 --> 10:23.000
This town has everything.
Demons, fiends, vampires....

10:23.970 --> 10:27.830
I know this isn't easy for you.
Most people can't deal with it.

10:28.769 --> 10:30.279
You should think about--

10:30.570 --> 10:34.149
Someone who's not even a person
lecturing me on most people.

10:34.769 --> 10:36.070
It's kind of funny.

10:37.769 --> 10:39.419
I can handle it fine.

10:40.169 --> 10:43.049
I don't care about most
people or what they think.

10:44.370 --> 10:47.279
I do care about ridding
this city of your kind.

10:48.570 --> 10:50.639
- My kind?
- Your kind.

10:51.570 --> 10:52.899
The kind that killed my father.

10:53.370 --> 10:55.259
You think I would forget about it?

10:57.570 --> 10:59.320
I don't forget anything.

11:19.330 --> 11:20.840
Death.

11:31.929 --> 11:34.669
Every source says it's death.

11:36.129 --> 11:39.820
It's just a prophecy.
It didn't come from on high.

11:40.929 --> 11:43.070
That's what a prophecy is.

11:43.929 --> 11:48.070
All right. Angel faces
death all the time...

11:48.730 --> 11:51.919
...just like a normal guy faces
waffles and French fries.

11:52.929 --> 11:56.049
It's something he faces
every day, like lunch.

11:57.129 --> 11:58.950
Are you hungry?

12:01.929 --> 12:04.559
The fact his death is prophesied...

12:06.129 --> 12:08.830
...doesn't concern me as
much as the way he reacted.

12:09.129 --> 12:12.750
What? He didn't scream as some of us
would have. Angel's cool.

12:13.929 --> 12:15.370
Angel's cut off.

12:15.730 --> 12:19.059
Death doesn't bother him because
there's nothing in life he wants.

12:20.529 --> 12:23.129
It's our desires that make us human.

12:24.129 --> 12:27.570
Angel's kind of human.
He's got a soul.

12:28.330 --> 12:31.809
He's got a soul, but he's
not a part of the world.

12:32.529 --> 12:34.179
He can't be part of the world.

12:34.929 --> 12:37.600
Because he doesn't want stuff?
That's ridiculous.

12:39.129 --> 12:41.159
- I want that!
- What connects us to life?

12:41.529 --> 12:42.970
I'm going with doughnuts.

12:43.929 --> 12:47.440
What connects us to life is the simple
truth that we are part of it.

12:48.129 --> 12:50.519
We live, we grow, we change.

12:53.529 --> 12:56.509
- But Angel....
- Can't do those things.

13:01.330 --> 13:02.840
Well, what are you saying?

13:03.730 --> 13:06.330
That Angel has nothing
to look forward to?

13:06.730 --> 13:11.299
- He'll always be here but cut off?
- Yes.

13:13.330 --> 13:15.429
That sucks!
We've gotta do something.

13:16.330 --> 13:18.860
- We have to help him.
- I'm not sure we can.

13:19.929 --> 13:23.259
What is your deal? You bore everyone
with your musty scrolls...

13:24.129 --> 13:25.950
...then you say we can't help?

13:26.529 --> 13:29.340
- He is what he is.
- He's Angel. He's good.

13:29.529 --> 13:32.899
And he helps the helpless,
and now he's one of them.

13:34.929 --> 13:37.000
He's gonna have to
want things from life...

13:37.929 --> 13:39.509
...whether he wants to or not!

13:45.730 --> 13:48.149
- Morning.
- Morning. Want some coffee?

13:48.730 --> 13:50.059
No, thanks.

13:50.529 --> 13:52.919
- How about a doughnut? Chocolate.
- No.

13:53.529 --> 13:56.409
- Creamy fillings?
- I don't want anything.

14:00.129 --> 14:01.879
Should I know what this is about?

14:04.330 --> 14:07.309
We were just discussing
how you don't...

14:10.330 --> 14:11.529
...want many things.

14:11.529 --> 14:14.269
You're cut off from life,
and we want to help.

14:15.129 --> 14:17.690
- Good.
- We'll start small. Keep it simple.

14:18.730 --> 14:20.590
How would you like a puppy?

14:22.330 --> 14:25.240
Right. A ficus?
They're low-maintenance.

14:26.529 --> 14:27.720
Ant farm?

14:28.330 --> 14:30.080
- I have to go.
- Where are you going?

14:30.730 --> 14:34.279
Rare book shops. I need references
to translate the prophecy.

14:36.129 --> 14:37.950
Not smart to take the scroll with me.

14:38.529 --> 14:40.700
I'll lock it up
in the weapons cabinet.

14:40.929 --> 14:43.879
Angel, I hope I'm
wrong about this, but...

14:44.529 --> 14:46.279
...you should see the Oracles.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.259
I don't need the Oracles.

14:49.330 --> 14:50.840
Well, think about it.

14:58.330 --> 14:59.769
Oracles.

15:00.730 --> 15:02.409
Get out of the house.

15:03.129 --> 15:04.570
Could be fun.

15:14.529 --> 15:17.059
- How dare you enter this sacred space?
- Who are you?

15:17.529 --> 15:19.779
We don't like being
called by a lower being.

15:20.529 --> 15:22.350
Never come here on a whim.

15:24.730 --> 15:27.889
- I'm not here on a whim.
- We do not counsel your kind.

15:28.929 --> 15:32.549
Darkness is not allowed past this
threshold. How did you get in?

15:33.129 --> 15:36.149
The old order passes away
and the new order is come.

15:36.730 --> 15:40.769
He that was first will be last,
and he that was dead shall arise.

15:41.529 --> 15:44.549
Yes, and he that is trespassing
shall now depart.

15:46.330 --> 15:47.840
We shall speak no more.

15:51.129 --> 15:53.340
Yes, I know.

16:33.490 --> 16:34.539
Do you paint?

16:35.289 --> 16:37.500
I was looking for
something for a friend.

16:37.690 --> 16:39.970
I thought maybe if he had a hobby....

16:41.289 --> 16:42.690
He's a little detached.

16:43.090 --> 16:44.669
They say art is the best therapy.

16:45.490 --> 16:46.539
- Really?
- Sure.

16:46.690 --> 16:51.149
It's used in mental institutions.
Creating helps them get in touch.

16:52.090 --> 16:55.000
He's not crazy or anything.
He's just different.

16:56.289 --> 16:57.450
Depressed.

16:58.090 --> 17:00.019
Well, he wears a lot of black.

17:01.690 --> 17:04.740
- How much are these pastels?
- You get the entire set...

17:05.289 --> 17:07.848
...some drawing paper
and little pop-up easel....

17:22.089 --> 17:25.529
You have everything he'll need,
and then some. Thanks.

17:26.289 --> 17:28.539
- You're welcome.
- He must be a good friend.

17:28.690 --> 17:31.009
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Take care.

17:31.690 --> 17:32.390
Bye.

18:38.890 --> 18:41.380
Someone get some help! Call 911!

19:48.410 --> 19:49.279
Hello?

19:52.009 --> 19:54.609
Yeah, what happened to her?
I'm her employer.

19:55.609 --> 19:58.029
She doesn't have any family in town.
What happened?

19:59.809 --> 20:01.109
I'm on my way.

20:38.210 --> 20:40.210
I'm looking for Cordelia Chase.

20:41.210 --> 20:43.910
The doctor is with her.
If you'll just have a seat.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.269
You have to let the doctor work!

20:48.410 --> 20:50.200
Try another five mils of Ativan.

20:52.609 --> 20:54.049
- Leave.
- What happened?

20:54.410 --> 20:55.319
- Are you family?
- Yes.

20:55.609 --> 20:57.359
I'm not sure what happened.

20:59.210 --> 21:00.750
- Is she mentally ill?
- No.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.220
She's having a psychotic episode.

21:04.009 --> 21:07.589
There's no organic damage,
but we can't seem to sedate her.

21:10.609 --> 21:13.700
Cordelia, can you hear me? Cordelia!

21:17.210 --> 21:17.910
Cordelia!

21:18.410 --> 21:21.740
- We tried drug therapy. Allergies?
- Drugs won't help.

21:22.609 --> 21:26.049
I need to inform you, if we don't
find a way to stop it....

22:35.930 --> 22:38.210
Wesley! Wesley!

22:40.130 --> 22:41.289
Wesley!

22:46.130 --> 22:46.970
Wes!

22:53.329 --> 22:54.450
Wes, Wesley!

23:21.529 --> 23:23.069
Never a dull moment.

23:23.329 --> 23:27.049
- I have to go.
- You're a witness. You can't go.

23:28.130 --> 23:31.109
- Want to try to stop me?
- I'm glad we're not friends.

23:31.730 --> 23:34.779
I'm tired of you.
There is a thing called the law!

23:35.329 --> 23:39.470
This is about life. I'm sorry about
your father, but I didn't kill him.

23:40.730 --> 23:43.710
I'm tired of being blamed
for what you can't handle!

23:44.329 --> 23:46.500
You want to be enemies? Try me.

23:53.329 --> 23:55.650
Clear! Okay, I got him back.

24:56.930 --> 24:57.730
Cordelia.

25:01.130 --> 25:02.319
I'm gonna fix this.

25:05.329 --> 25:06.660
I promise.

25:08.930 --> 25:10.680
I'm gonna get you back.

25:13.730 --> 25:15.410
I need you back.

25:35.089 --> 25:38.109
I come before the Oracles
for guidance and direction.

25:38.690 --> 25:40.549
I ask access to the knowing ones.

26:10.490 --> 26:11.789
It's unfortunate.

26:13.490 --> 26:17.109
Things are unraveling. The dark ones
broach our temples now.

26:17.690 --> 26:20.039
- Can you help me?
- I can't stay long.

26:20.690 --> 26:23.920
I've been dead a while.
So far I don't like it.

26:24.289 --> 26:26.819
- My friend--
- Is in trouble. It's his mark.

26:27.890 --> 26:31.509
- Who did it?
- Vocah, warrior of the underworld.

26:32.089 --> 26:36.660
He wants you weak, so he opened her
mind to all those in pain and need.

26:38.690 --> 26:40.940
- She doesn't have long.
- How can I stop it?

26:41.690 --> 26:45.519
Vocah has the scroll of Aberjian.
The scroll is what you need.

26:46.490 --> 26:48.309
- Wait.
- Find the scroll.

26:49.490 --> 26:52.299
The words of Anatole
can save your friend.

26:53.089 --> 26:55.619
- Where is he?
- He is here for the raising.

26:56.089 --> 26:59.569
- The raising?
- Like many, he hides behind man's law.

27:01.490 --> 27:02.890
Stop him.

27:05.690 --> 27:06.880
I will.

27:09.569 --> 27:11.849
Hungry people will appreciate this.

27:12.569 --> 27:16.609
This is God's work. If God was
a busboy he'd look like you, Jesus.

27:17.369 --> 27:19.160
Toss it up, brother. All right!

27:20.369 --> 27:21.170
Heads up!

27:25.769 --> 27:27.309
Put them down. I know him.

27:28.769 --> 27:31.579
- What you got under the hood?
- I need your help.

27:32.369 --> 27:34.509
I know you didn't come
to see how I am.

27:34.769 --> 27:38.529
I'm fine. You getting enough iron?
You look a little pale.

27:40.170 --> 27:43.680
It's traditional to humor people
that do favors for you.

27:44.369 --> 27:45.420
I need another.

27:45.569 --> 27:47.710
If it's killing
a vampire, I'm in.

27:48.569 --> 27:49.759
That's my idea of a good time.

27:49.769 --> 27:51.519
My people are in the hospital.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.339
One's in ICU, one's in the psych unit.

27:55.170 --> 27:56.750
They need protection.

27:57.569 --> 27:59.009
Who's coming for them?

27:59.369 --> 28:02.390
However he comes, he will fail.
These people mean a lot to me.

28:03.569 --> 28:04.940
I'm getting that.

28:20.970 --> 28:24.589
We have prepared a holy place
and anointed it with oil.

28:25.170 --> 28:28.750
We took the blood of the living
and gathered the living dead.

28:30.569 --> 28:32.890
As it was written,
they shall prepare the way...

28:33.569 --> 28:36.130
...and the very gates
of hell shall open.

28:36.569 --> 28:39.099
That which is above shall tremble...

28:39.569 --> 28:42.200
...for that which
is below shall arise.

28:43.170 --> 28:44.920
And the world shall know the beast...

28:46.170 --> 28:48.730
...and the beast shall know the world.

29:00.569 --> 29:01.619
Are we late?

29:01.769 --> 29:03.730
Never be on time for a ritual.

29:04.170 --> 29:06.339
The chanting and blood rites
go on forever.

29:11.369 --> 29:12.559
You guys follow us.

29:14.369 --> 29:16.619
- I know you covered all the bases.
- Yes.

29:16.769 --> 29:18.769
Senior partners are watching this.

29:19.769 --> 29:21.839
- We can't let them down.
- We won't.

29:25.170 --> 29:28.720
Robert Price let them down
and they made him eat his liver.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.500
I don't know why I thought of that.

30:02.970 --> 30:05.569
- Five are without breath.
- Yet they live.

30:10.769 --> 30:13.819
- Five are without time.
- Yet they live.

30:22.769 --> 30:25.160
- Five are without soul.
- Yet they live.

30:26.369 --> 30:28.759
They haven't even gotten
to the Latin yet.

30:30.569 --> 30:33.759
- Five are without sun.
- Yet they live.

30:49.769 --> 30:51.660
- What is it?
- I don't know.

31:04.170 --> 31:05.890
Lindsey.

31:20.369 --> 31:21.980
Five are dead.

31:23.970 --> 31:26.180
- Say it!
- Yet they live.

31:31.170 --> 31:32.539
- Get the movers.
- Yes, sir.

32:07.890 --> 32:09.119
Get it out of here.

33:06.089 --> 33:07.529
Nice.

33:21.089 --> 33:23.789
Lindsey, give me the scroll.

33:25.289 --> 33:27.180
No. It belongs to us.

33:28.289 --> 33:30.990
"Us." You put your
faith in Wolfram and Hart.

33:31.890 --> 33:34.559
- You said I had to make a choice.
- And you did.

33:36.089 --> 33:36.690
Yeah.

33:36.690 --> 33:40.130
I had a crisis. I want to thank you
for your help with that.

33:40.890 --> 33:44.329
- I see things more clearly now.
- You don't see at all.

33:45.690 --> 33:49.660
I see that this was foretold
and that doesn't bode well for you.

33:51.690 --> 33:55.170
I see that you're either the one
with the power or powerless.

33:55.890 --> 33:58.519
Do you see what I'll do
if I don't get the scroll?

33:58.890 --> 34:03.210
You need this to cure your friend.
She is your link to The Powers.

34:04.289 --> 34:08.469
And since it's foretold that we sever
all your connections, well....

34:20.489 --> 34:23.050
Don't believe
everything you're foretold.

34:30.210 --> 34:33.969
"And if the beast shalt
find thee, and touch thee...

34:35.010 --> 34:37.289
...thou shalt be wounded
in thy soul...

34:39.210 --> 34:41.030
...and thou shalt know madness.

34:42.809 --> 34:45.340
The beast shalt attack
and cripple thee...

34:46.409 --> 34:49.320
...and thou shalt know
neither friend nor family.

34:52.409 --> 34:54.409
But thou shalt undo the beast.

34:54.809 --> 34:58.219
Thou shalt find
the sacred words of Anatole...

34:59.610 --> 35:02.349
...and thou shalt be restored.

35:05.610 --> 35:08.280
Three times shalt thou say
these words:

35:09.809 --> 35:13.110
Unbind, unbind, unbind."

35:26.610 --> 35:29.380
- Hey.
- Angel.

35:35.010 --> 35:36.800
Welcome back.

35:38.610 --> 35:40.360
I'll get Dr. Evans.

35:48.210 --> 35:52.000
I saw them all.
There is so much pain.

35:57.809 --> 35:59.769
We have to help them.

36:00.210 --> 36:01.369
We will.

36:03.809 --> 36:04.889
We will.

36:24.809 --> 36:26.530
- Here is something.
- What?

36:27.210 --> 36:31.389
The beast of Amalfi, a razor-toothed,
six-eyed harbinger of death.

36:33.210 --> 36:36.650
No, wait, that's due
to arise in 2003 in Reseda.

36:37.409 --> 36:39.510
I would've guessed Tarzana.

36:41.610 --> 36:43.639
Better cross-reference that.

36:44.610 --> 36:47.309
I don't know what they
raised in that box.

36:49.409 --> 36:50.389
I'll keep looking.

36:50.610 --> 36:54.400
You've been looking for two days.
You need to relax and recharge.

36:54.809 --> 36:56.250
Here. Eat.

36:59.010 --> 37:00.380
You too.

37:02.610 --> 37:04.860
Don't be embarrassed. We're family.

37:10.409 --> 37:11.739
What?

37:12.809 --> 37:15.199
It's just I'm not used to....

37:15.809 --> 37:17.179
He's not used to the new you.

37:20.610 --> 37:22.360
I know what's out there now.

37:22.409 --> 37:26.269
We have a lot of evil to fight,
a lot of people to help.

37:27.210 --> 37:29.880
I hope you can figure
out what the lawyers raised...

37:30.809 --> 37:33.409
...sometime before the prophecy
kicks in, and you croak.

37:36.210 --> 37:39.019
- That was the old me, wasn't it?
- I like them both.

37:47.610 --> 37:48.309
Oops.

37:50.610 --> 37:51.840
I may have made a mistake.

37:52.409 --> 37:55.219
The word that I said meant
you were going to die...

37:56.010 --> 37:57.940
...means that you are going to live.

37:59.010 --> 38:02.380
Okay, as tiny mistakes go,
that's not one.

38:03.210 --> 38:07.349
Shanshu has roots in many languages.
The most ancient is the Proto-Bantu.

38:08.010 --> 38:10.469
They consider life and death
the same thing.

38:11.010 --> 38:12.619
It's part of a cycle.

38:13.409 --> 38:15.869
Only a thing that's not alive
never dies.

38:16.409 --> 38:18.969
It's saying you get to live
until you die.

38:20.010 --> 38:24.289
It's saying....
It's saying you become human.

38:27.809 --> 38:29.460
That's the prophecy?

38:32.010 --> 38:35.099
"The vampire with a soul,
once he fulfills his destiny...

38:35.610 --> 38:37.679
...will shanshu." Become human.

38:39.809 --> 38:41.139
It's his reward.

38:41.610 --> 38:44.380
Wow. Angel, human.

38:47.010 --> 38:48.340
That'd be nice.

38:48.809 --> 38:52.809
Wait. What's that thing about him
having to fulfill his destiny first?

38:53.610 --> 38:56.769
It's saying it won't happen
tomorrow or the next day.

38:57.809 --> 39:01.599
He has to survive coming darkness,
apocalyptic battles, plagues...

39:02.010 --> 39:03.590
...and some...

39:05.010 --> 39:07.219
...several, not that many...

39:08.010 --> 39:10.849
...fiends that will be
unleashed upon the world.

39:11.610 --> 39:13.570
So don't break out
the champagne just yet.

39:14.010 --> 39:17.449
Yeah, break out the champagne,
Pinocchio. This is a big deal.

39:23.610 --> 39:25.119
I guess it is.

39:26.010 --> 39:27.239
Typical.

39:27.809 --> 39:31.639
I hook up with the only person
who came to L.A. to get older.

39:53.010 --> 39:56.099
The senior partners were
impressed with your sacrifice.

39:57.809 --> 40:00.579
Trust me.
We'll even the score with him.

40:01.409 --> 40:02.570
Yes, we will.

40:04.409 --> 40:07.079
Beginning with what's in that box.

40:09.809 --> 40:12.300
We are all very pleased you're here.

40:13.409 --> 40:16.010
I know it's a bit confusing...

40:17.010 --> 40:19.039
...but it's gonna be better soon.

40:19.409 --> 40:21.019
A lot better...

40:23.610 --> 40:24.869
...Darla.
