01:23.850 --> 01:26.516
Encore! Uh, "The Summer Song."

01:26.518 --> 01:28.253
He just played
"The Summer Song."

01:28.255 --> 01:30.488
Well, play it again, then.

01:30.490 --> 01:32.689
Or just any song with "summer"
in the title. Doesn't matter.

01:32.691 --> 01:34.492
Uh, cheers, guys.
I'm gonna take a bit of a break

01:34.494 --> 01:36.494
- and then I'll come back.
- Are you being serious?

01:37.330 --> 01:38.563
That's it.

01:38.565 --> 01:39.963
I can't believe I missed it.

01:43.869 --> 01:46.271
Jack.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.572
Sir.

01:47.574 --> 01:50.608
How are you...
enjoying the job?

01:50.610 --> 01:51.808
Yeah, not bad. Good, thanks.

01:51.810 --> 01:55.647
I've noticed
the customers like you.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.715
Okay, great. Yeah, well,
I try to be friendly.

01:57.717 --> 01:59.016
Unlike me.

01:59.018 --> 02:01.385
I'm increasingly finding
I don't like you.

02:01.387 --> 02:03.521
- Right.
- You know, the beard

02:03.523 --> 02:04.688
gets on my nerves.

02:04.690 --> 02:05.557
What's wrong with shaving?

02:05.559 --> 02:06.524
- Yeah, I know. I suppose I...
- Yeah...

02:06.526 --> 02:08.292
And I don't like the way
you're always late.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.693
I-I don't like the way
you dress.

02:09.696 --> 02:11.729
And worse, I get the feeling

02:11.731 --> 02:13.731
you think working here
is beneath you.

02:13.733 --> 02:16.667
- Oh.
- But the customers like you.

02:16.669 --> 02:21.475
So, if you want to
go full-time, you can.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.608
Right.

02:24.610 --> 02:25.843
Okay. Well, yeah, great.

02:25.845 --> 02:27.612
Uh, let me think about that.

02:27.614 --> 02:30.447
Or, eh, here's
the alternative, son.

02:30.449 --> 02:32.316
Two weeks,
you're out on your ear.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.756
Yeah. I'll give the job
to dozy Karen.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.523
Okay, great.

02:39.525 --> 02:41.358
Well, classic. Um...

02:41.360 --> 02:43.027
- Yeah, I'll get right back to you.
- Good.

02:43.029 --> 02:44.494
There's someone to see you.

02:44.496 --> 02:47.432
Make it quick.
We've got stuff to sell.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.970
Do you want the good news
or the bad news?

02:52.972 --> 02:54.071
I'm gonna have to say
good news,

02:54.073 --> 02:55.739
'cause I don't think I could
take any more bad news.

02:55.741 --> 02:56.607
Well, the good news is

02:56.609 --> 02:59.376
you're booked
for Latitude Festival.

02:59.378 --> 03:01.112
No!

03:01.114 --> 03:02.846
Yes! Yes!

03:02.848 --> 03:04.047
It's not the biggest...

03:04.049 --> 03:05.583
It's the,
it's the Suffolk Tent.

03:05.585 --> 03:07.051
I don't care what tent,
it's Latitude!

Latitude.

04:05.412 --> 04:09.049
Uh, yeah, it's been a blast.

04:20.892 --> 04:23.494
I thought "Dinosaur"
was particularly strong.

04:23.496 --> 04:25.629
Well, yeah, I got most of
the words right.

04:25.631 --> 04:26.898
"Hear me roar,

04:26.900 --> 04:29.600
- I'm a dinosaur."
- Rocky!

04:29.602 --> 04:30.968
- What are you doing here?
- Yes, mate!

04:30.970 --> 04:33.069
- Yeah!
- Oh!

04:33.071 --> 04:35.939
- I'm a road manager, innit.
- Oh!

04:35.941 --> 04:37.975
So everyone who said
that you were a lazy,

04:37.977 --> 04:40.511
- useless, drug-taking drunk...
- Hello.

04:40.513 --> 04:42.513
...who'd never get a job
were wrong.

04:42.515 --> 04:43.780
Yes, they were, actually.

04:43.782 --> 04:45.816
I'm in profitable employment.

04:45.818 --> 04:48.151
A valued cog in
a well-oiled rock machine.

04:48.153 --> 04:49.754
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:49.756 --> 04:51.054
Good set, though, mate.

04:51.056 --> 04:52.590
- Yeah.
- Did you hear it? I didn't see you.

04:52.592 --> 04:53.691
I-If I'm totally honest,

04:53.693 --> 04:55.725
I only popped by for
a quick bong behind the tent.

04:55.727 --> 04:57.929
- Oh.
- But it was a lovely surprise to hear you.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.196
I mean,
I didn't hear much of it,

04:59.198 --> 05:00.965
to be honest, 'cause...

05:00.967 --> 05:04.068
of the bong and stuff,
but... yeah.

05:04.070 --> 05:06.504
Ah, you're still making sweet
love to young Ellie, I see.

05:06.506 --> 05:07.571
- No.
- No.

05:07.573 --> 05:10.975
No, never. Not once.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.044
That's a shame.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.679
She's my manager.

05:14.681 --> 05:17.514
Hey, do you wanna come
backstage for our gig?

05:17.516 --> 05:18.850
- Wha... Please.
- Yeah?

05:18.852 --> 05:20.550
Let's do it, then.

05:20.552 --> 05:21.985
- Let's rock this road.
- All right.

05:21.987 --> 05:23.687
So how long you been
back in Suffolk?

05:23.689 --> 05:25.922
Oof. Well, I'm trying to live
outside the traditional

05:25.924 --> 05:27.124
concept of time.

05:27.126 --> 05:29.794
So, could be weeks,
could me months,

05:29.796 --> 05:31.696
could be a year and a half,
no idea.

05:31.698 --> 05:33.263
Oh, here we are.

05:33.265 --> 05:34.934
Thank you so much.

05:37.903 --> 05:39.537
So what exactly do you do?

05:39.539 --> 05:41.239
Make sure everything runs
like clockwork.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.273
- Service the equipment.
- Right.

05:43.275 --> 05:46.877
Make sandwiches, make teas.

05:46.879 --> 05:48.614
Uh... Oh, Christ.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.518
Sorry.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.186
Sorry. Sorry, Michael.

05:56.188 --> 05:57.588
You're fired.

05:57.590 --> 05:58.659
Fair do's.

06:04.162 --> 06:06.165
Got fired.

06:07.967 --> 06:09.165
Give Ellie one for me, yeah?

06:09.167 --> 06:10.887
- No, really, we don't...
- Catch you later.

06:17.109 --> 06:18.675
Oh, great day.

06:18.677 --> 06:19.910
Yeah, great day.

06:19.912 --> 06:22.246
Though, Elle,
we should stop now.

06:22.248 --> 06:23.948
I can't do this anymore.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.949
Don't be stupid.

06:25.951 --> 06:27.884
You're gonna need
a bigger tent.

06:27.886 --> 06:29.252
You're
gonna need a bigger tent.

06:29.254 --> 06:31.155
No, okay, stop.
You gotta stop pretending

06:31.157 --> 06:35.191
that we're in a thrilling story
with a big, exciting end.

06:35.193 --> 06:37.727
We're in a little story
and it ends now.

06:37.729 --> 06:39.696
I think I hear something
special in my songs,

06:39.698 --> 06:41.165
you think you hear
something special,

06:41.167 --> 06:42.600
and I love you for it.

06:42.602 --> 06:44.302
But no one else does.
No one ever has.

06:44.304 --> 06:45.970
Uh, Nick loves
"The Summer Song."

06:45.972 --> 06:48.706
Nick is famously
a world-class moron.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.107
If it hasn't happened by now,
it's not going to.

06:51.109 --> 06:52.275
It'll take a miracle.

06:52.277 --> 06:54.145
Miracles happen.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.679
I mean it.

06:55.681 --> 06:57.247
This is a serious moment
for me.

06:57.249 --> 06:59.083
This is just absolutely
not happening.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.720
Look, I can't be the star that
we thought I could be at 14,

07:02.722 --> 07:04.287
on that day in the school hall

07:04.289 --> 07:06.958
when I sang a pretty cool cover
of "Wonderwall"

07:06.960 --> 07:09.193
and you were there, backstage.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.694
- I'm not hearing a word.
- Okay, but look.

07:10.696 --> 07:13.997
This, this was my last gig.

07:13.999 --> 07:16.934
And I'm so happy
you were there.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.773
This is the end of our long
and winding road.

07:25.712 --> 07:27.677
Come on!
The world is full of miracles.

07:27.679 --> 07:29.045
Like what?

07:29.047 --> 07:30.982
Benedict Cumberbatch
becoming a sex symbol.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.984
- Oh...
- You'll change your mind.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.052
I won't. This is the start
of a better life.

07:35.054 --> 07:38.559
And I'm...
feeling perky about it.

07:51.037 --> 07:52.138
Mmm.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.639
Night-night, rock star.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.076
Yeah. Night-night.

09:27.867 --> 09:30.067
You all right, mate?

09:35.240 --> 09:37.009
Just a few minutes, okay?

09:48.186 --> 09:50.453
Can I just say one thing?

09:50.455 --> 09:54.190
Just to... warn you.

09:54.192 --> 09:56.426
I've spoken with the doctor
and you,

09:56.428 --> 09:58.896
you will walk again.

09:58.898 --> 10:02.031
But you have lost your beard

10:02.033 --> 10:04.834
and, um, two big teeth.

10:04.836 --> 10:06.116
And even though
it should be sad,

10:06.806 --> 10:08.506
it's actually very funny,
unfortunately.

10:08.508 --> 10:12.041
So despite all the pain and inconvenience,

10:12.043 --> 10:14.344
you're not even gonna get
any sympathy.

10:14.346 --> 10:17.414
People will just laugh at you.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.121
Ow.

10:22.220 --> 10:24.420
What happened?

10:24.422 --> 10:27.525
No one knows.

10:27.527 --> 10:28.925
It was all over the world.

10:28.927 --> 10:32.029
Electricity flicked off
for 12 seconds.

10:32.031 --> 10:33.863
You were just unlucky
that at that exact moment,

10:33.865 --> 10:34.867
a big bus hit you.

10:35.768 --> 10:36.800
You know, the weird thing
they thought

10:36.802 --> 10:37.668
was gonna happen at midnight
when we hit 2000?

10:37.670 --> 10:40.471
- Oh, yeah, Y2K.
- It sort of happened.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.808
It was very big news which,
um, you missed entirely.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.943
- Because of the bus.
- Ah.

10:45.945 --> 10:48.279
Mm-hmm.

10:48.281 --> 10:51.818
Right. I've gotta
get back to school.

10:53.085 --> 10:55.319
- Elle?
- Yeah?

10:55.321 --> 10:57.854
Thanks for taking
such good care of me.

10:57.856 --> 11:00.491
You're welcome.
I'll come back later.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.059
Will you still need me,

11:02.061 --> 11:04.328
will you still feed me,
when I'm 64?

11:04.330 --> 11:06.296
I don't know.
I'll think about it.

11:06.298 --> 11:08.998
- Why 64?
- What do you mean?

11:09.000 --> 11:13.002
It's just... oh, forget it.

11:13.004 --> 11:15.441
What do you mean, "Why 64?"

11:20.012 --> 11:21.212
<i>I think the accident</i>

11:21.214 --> 11:22.413
<i>was a message from God.</i>

11:22.415 --> 11:25.149
Yeah, he was very angry.

11:25.151 --> 11:27.150
Elle, you think
me getting hit by a bus

11:27.152 --> 11:29.053
was God's way of telling me
not to go back to teaching?

11:29.055 --> 11:30.621
Exactly.

11:30.623 --> 11:31.921
Incredible. It's amazing.

11:31.923 --> 11:34.058
You know, God loves your stuff.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.359
Look, if God had been remotely
interested in my stuff,

11:36.361 --> 11:38.027
he would've once,
right, just once,

11:38.029 --> 11:40.530
had someone write me
a fan letter who wasn't my mum.

11:40.532 --> 11:42.165
Or me.

11:42.167 --> 11:44.101
Yeah.

11:44.103 --> 11:46.102
I didn't ask
to be The Beatles,

11:46.104 --> 11:48.104
you know, I just wanted once
to have a standing ovation

11:48.106 --> 11:50.341
not given by people who were
already standing at the bar.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.242
Be the what?

11:57.048 --> 11:59.282
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, yeah.

11:59.284 --> 12:01.452
Carol, come and look!

12:01.454 --> 12:03.219
I know Ellie said it was funny,

12:03.221 --> 12:05.923
but no one mentioned visual
humor of this quality.

12:05.925 --> 12:09.559
Jack! Oh, my God! Your teeth.

12:09.561 --> 12:11.594
- Cheese!
- Oh, wow.

12:11.596 --> 12:13.897
Presents, presents,

12:13.899 --> 12:15.466
- presents. - Mm, presents, presents.
- Yes, yes.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.468
It's true, we have
bought you presents.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.236
- Exciting.
- Well, they have, obviously.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.637
- Huge work week.
- Yeah, yeah.

12:20.639 --> 12:22.439
What do we have here?

12:22.441 --> 12:24.241
Okay, okay, okay.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.410
- Uh, boom! Hey!
- Oh, wow.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.179
- Because you lost your teeth. That's...
- Yeah, I know.

12:29.181 --> 12:31.147
That's why that's funny. Okay.

12:31.149 --> 12:33.217
- Number two.
- Where did you get that?

12:35.421 --> 12:36.687
- 'Cause you got hit by a bus.
- Yeah, I remember.

12:36.689 --> 12:37.688
Do you?

12:37.690 --> 12:39.022
- Hilarious.
- Yeah.

12:39.024 --> 12:40.357
All right. One more.

12:40.359 --> 12:42.626
- I've signed your name, don't worry.
- One more, yes.

12:42.628 --> 12:44.995
I don't know what this one
could possibly be.

12:44.997 --> 12:46.997
- Oh, my... Neither do I.
- No idea.

12:46.999 --> 12:49.666
I mean, I'm thinking some
sort of snow shovel.

12:49.668 --> 12:53.404
- Mm-hmm.
- Or a... tiny little giraffe with no legs.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.204
Just open it, open it, open it.

12:55.206 --> 12:56.406
Oh.

12:56.408 --> 12:57.943
Okay.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.483
Wow.

13:06.418 --> 13:08.184
'Cause yours got run over by a bus.

13:08.186 --> 13:10.020
Well, play something.

13:10.022 --> 13:11.387
- Yes, play something.
- Come on.

13:11.389 --> 13:13.723
- Play "The Summer Song."
- Let me get rid of this.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.560
Hey!

13:17.562 --> 13:19.029
What's tickin' and tockin'
and rockin'?

13:19.031 --> 13:20.430
- Yeah! - Oh!
- What is he doing here?

13:20.432 --> 13:22.433
Yeah, he got sacked.
He's staying with us,

13:22.435 --> 13:24.568
- sleeping on the sofa.
- That is a disaster

13:24.570 --> 13:26.337
- that could last forever... Yep.
- Terrible decision.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.670
- That's right.
- ...and ruin your entire life.

13:27.672 --> 13:28.539
Absolutely.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.406
Hey, really glad
you're not dead, man.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.175
He's got a new guitar.

13:32.177 --> 13:34.147
- He's gonna play a song.
- Ow. - ROCKY: Epic.

13:36.614 --> 13:39.551

requires a great song.

14:58.797 --> 15:01.397
That was one of
the most beautiful songs

15:01.399 --> 15:03.699
- I've ever heard.
- Yeah. I mean,

15:03.701 --> 15:05.501
it's a bit-bit sloppy,
but it's sweet.

15:05.503 --> 15:09.173
- Oh.
- When did you write that?

15:09.175 --> 15:11.341
I didn't write it.
Paul McCartney wrote it,

15:11.343 --> 15:12.443
The Beatles.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.111
Who?

15:14.113 --> 15:15.478
The Beatles.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.080
The what?

15:17.082 --> 15:19.750
John, Paul, George
and Ringo, The Beatles.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.452
Which beetles is this?

15:21.454 --> 15:22.934
The insect beetles
or the car Beetles?

15:23.556 --> 15:25.255
The pop group Beatles...
Nick, help me out here.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.491
Right. Yes.

15:27.493 --> 15:30.794
Um, there's this problem
with musicians.

15:30.796 --> 15:33.429
They presume everyone else has
this encyclopedic knowledge

15:33.431 --> 15:35.866
of obscure pop, make you
feel stupid when you haven't

15:35.868 --> 15:37.568
heard of bands, you know,

15:37.570 --> 15:40.670
like Neutral Milk Hotel,
or, uh, The Monophonics,

15:40.672 --> 15:44.107
or, in this case, The Beatles.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.843
Wow, this is the most
complicated joke

15:45.845 --> 15:47.111
- I've ever heard.
- No...

15:47.113 --> 15:48.045
Nice song, though.

15:48.047 --> 15:50.179
- It's not a nice song.
- No, it is, mate.

15:50.181 --> 15:51.214
Don't do yourself down

15:51.216 --> 15:53.650
just 'cause you look like
a cartoon character.

15:53.652 --> 15:55.251
It's-it's a very nice song.

15:55.253 --> 15:56.652
It's not a very nice song,
Nick.

15:56.654 --> 15:58.588
It's one of the greatest songs
ever written.

15:58.590 --> 16:02.192
Well, it's not Coldplay.
It's not "Fix You."

16:02.194 --> 16:03.894
It's not bloody "Fix You,"
Carol,

16:03.896 --> 16:07.530
it's a great,
great work of art.

16:07.532 --> 16:11.470
Wow, somebody suddenly got
very cocky.

16:13.505 --> 16:15.506
<i>That song was exquisite.</i>

16:15.508 --> 16:17.207
<i>How come I've never
heard it before?</i>

16:17.209 --> 16:19.208
Okay, I don't know what
you guys are playing at,

16:19.210 --> 16:22.512
but this is so weird,
a-and quite unfair,

16:22.514 --> 16:24.580
in light of me
having lost two teeth,

16:24.582 --> 16:26.750
looking like a sort of
reverse rabbit.

16:26.752 --> 16:28.484
I-I'm on pretty heavy
medication.

16:28.486 --> 16:30.420
Just let me out.

16:30.422 --> 16:31.889
All right.

16:35.393 --> 16:36.727
I thought you liked the medication.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.261
Yeah, I do love the medication.

16:38.263 --> 16:40.697
I really don't know
what you're cross about.

16:41.901 --> 16:44.471
Jack...

17:24.810 --> 17:26.742
Oh, Christ.

17:26.743 --> 17:29.646
No way. No way.

17:29.648 --> 17:31.917
Okay. All right.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.259
Mm.

17:44.330 --> 17:46.698
Okay.

17:54.673 --> 17:57.676
Oh... you are having me on.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.855
B, B, B, B.

18:11.857 --> 18:13.593
"Bowie," "Beck,"
"Beach Boys."

18:17.529 --> 18:20.297
No. Stop it.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.874
Oh, fuck off!

18:30.876 --> 18:32.041
No!

18:45.491 --> 18:47.260
Okay.

18:48.660 --> 18:49.859
No.

18:49.861 --> 18:52.428
Okay, let's just...

19:33.738 --> 19:37.406
- What...?
- Do you genuinely not know who The Beatles are?

19:37.408 --> 19:38.408
Genuinely.

19:39.477 --> 19:41.110
Okay.

19:41.112 --> 19:43.946
Then I'm in a really, really,
really complicated situation.

19:43.948 --> 19:45.081

Christ. I don't even know

19:54.693 --> 19:56.592
if I can remember the words
to the songs.

19:56.594 --> 19:59.796
Okay. "Eleanor Rigby...

19:59.798 --> 20:02.465
"Eleanor Rigby lives
in a church,

20:28.761 --> 20:30.997
<i>Can I do this?</i>

- Four and one.

Hello, love.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.242
I'm just at, uh,
Jed and Sheila's house

25:12.244 --> 25:14.911
listening to Jack's new song.
"Let Him Be."

25:14.913 --> 25:16.378
- "Let It Be."
- "Let It Be."

25:16.380 --> 25:19.749
No, well, apparently,
he's-he's started up again.

25:19.751 --> 25:21.283
Yeah.

Listen, I'll-I'll...
I'll call you back

25:32.997 --> 25:34.798

25:34.800 --> 25:35.831
Oh, all right, then.

25:35.833 --> 25:37.434
Yeah. Okay.

25:37.436 --> 25:40.103

25:40.105 --> 25:41.937

I've heard it three times now.

25:41.939 --> 25:43.072

I'm gonna go from the top.

25:43.074 --> 25:44.142
Please yourself, son.

25:48.879 --> 25:51.246

25:51.248 --> 25:54.717

on Earth to hear this song.

The revelation.

27:31.448 --> 27:35.454

but no one's interested still.

27:37.254 --> 27:38.988

31:38.629 --> 31:41.329
You ever thought about doing
a wholesale-based song?

31:41.331 --> 31:42.665
Not really, no.

31:42.667 --> 31:45.401
You could call it, uh,
"In My Warehouse"

31:45.403 --> 31:46.735
instead of "In My Life."

31:46.737 --> 31:49.371
Now, time to find out
what's happening

31:49.373 --> 31:51.473
in Kerry's Kitchen.

31:51.475 --> 31:52.755
G'day, everyone.
It's Kerry here.

31:55.312 --> 31:57.713
I could've written every song
of the Rolling Stones

31:57.715 --> 31:59.150
or David Bowie.

32:00.284 --> 32:02.318
I'll always just be Lowestoft's
warbling warehouseman.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.752
Oh, no, don't.

32:03.754 --> 32:08.156
- That's not true.
- So obviously is.

32:08.158 --> 32:11.694
That song was really beautiful.

32:11.696 --> 32:13.631
Who-who did you write it about?

32:14.732 --> 32:17.200
Stop here. Stop the car.

32:21.673 --> 32:24.406
- Elle.
- Hmm?

32:24.408 --> 32:27.542
- These songs.
- Mm.

32:27.544 --> 32:30.579
There's something about 'em
you should know.

32:33.484 --> 32:36.284
Oh. Hi.

32:36.286 --> 32:38.320
Hi... it's the
musician... Ed Sheeran.

32:38.322 --> 32:40.490
- I beg your pardon.
- Ed Sheeran.

32:40.492 --> 32:43.225
- I'm a musician.
- Yeah, no, seriously though, who is it?

32:43.227 --> 32:45.147
This must be a bad line,
I'll-I'll call you back.

32:47.665 --> 32:49.866
Who was it?

32:49.868 --> 32:51.901
He said it was Ed Sheeran,
the musician.

32:51.903 --> 32:53.235
That'll be Nick.

32:53.237 --> 32:55.171
Mm.

32:55.173 --> 32:56.539
Nick!

32:56.541 --> 32:57.807
No, it's Ed Sheeran again.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.709
Yeah, can I speak
to Carol, please?

32:59.711 --> 33:01.176
There's no one
called Carol here.

33:01.178 --> 33:02.878
Except there is.
She's always there.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.615
Okay, mate, um,
I'll leave it there.

33:05.617 --> 33:07.782
Amazing performance tonight
though, on TV.

33:07.784 --> 33:10.788
That song, "In My Life,"
that was really beautiful.

33:13.190 --> 33:16.291
What did he say?

33:16.293 --> 33:18.461
He said he really enjoyed
"In My Life."

33:18.463 --> 33:20.328
And what did Carol say?

33:20.330 --> 33:23.265
- She wasn't there.
- She's always there.

33:23.267 --> 33:25.870
I think it might've been
Ed Sheeran.

33:27.938 --> 33:29.807
The musician?

33:47.225 --> 33:49.258
Hi.

33:49.260 --> 33:50.792
- Hello.
- I'm Ed.

33:50.794 --> 33:53.695
- Um, is Jack here?
- Oh. Right.

33:53.697 --> 33:55.530
I'll see if he's up.
Just wait there, love.

33:55.532 --> 33:58.367
Jack!

33:58.369 --> 34:00.336
- It's for you.
- Who is it?

34:00.338 --> 34:01.639
His name's Ed.

34:05.944 --> 34:08.744
He's got a nice, friendly face.

34:08.746 --> 34:12.851
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:15.752 --> 34:18.389
C... Uh, come in.

34:20.924 --> 34:23.992
Your shirt's inside out.

34:23.994 --> 34:27.462
Oh, Christ.

34:27.464 --> 34:29.266
Uh, we should...

34:30.335 --> 34:31.766
Ouch.

34:31.768 --> 34:34.402
So, uh, look, I'm sorry
to barge in like this.

34:34.404 --> 34:35.804
No, no, uh, major pop stars

34:35.806 --> 34:37.273
are always dropping round,
you know?

34:37.275 --> 34:38.641
Lady Gaga won't leave us alone.

34:38.643 --> 34:40.875
You're funny.

34:40.877 --> 34:42.378
Well, funny-looking, at least.

34:42.380 --> 34:44.246
Yeah, so, anyway, I live, uh,

34:44.248 --> 34:46.983
I live locally,
and I saw your song on TV.

34:46.985 --> 34:50.319
And it was really good.

34:50.321 --> 34:51.721
- Wow.
- So I googled you,

34:51.723 --> 34:55.724
and I listened to your songs
on the warehouse website.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.626
And they were even better.

34:57.628 --> 34:58.694
Gosh, thanks.

34:58.696 --> 35:01.396
All right, don't mind me.

35:01.398 --> 35:02.931
So, I've had
the support act drop out

35:02.933 --> 35:05.000
of the European leg
of the tour,

35:05.002 --> 35:06.936
and I was wondering
if you'd consider it.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.672
- Consider what?
- S... Yeah.

35:09.674 --> 35:11.574
Being the opening act.

35:11.576 --> 35:13.275
- For you, seriously?
- Nope.

35:13.277 --> 35:14.312
Yeah, why not?

35:15.246 --> 35:16.612
W-Wha... When would I start?

35:16.614 --> 35:18.447
Tuesday.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.349
Do you know
where the pickle is?

35:20.351 --> 35:21.516
No.

35:21.518 --> 35:23.552
- No.
- Tu... What, Tuesday?

35:23.554 --> 35:25.520
- Not next July?
- No. Tuesday.

35:25.522 --> 35:27.456
- Is your hearing all right?
- No.

35:27.458 --> 35:28.958
No, my hearing is fine,
it's just, you keep saying

35:28.960 --> 35:30.358
lots of really strange things.

35:30.360 --> 35:33.462
But yes, yes, thank you, yes.

35:33.464 --> 35:36.732
- Um, how long do you need?
- About 30 minutes. Maximum.

35:36.734 --> 35:38.067
Any more than that, people
start getting a bit restless.

35:38.069 --> 35:40.569
- You know, "Bring on the ginger geezer."
- Yeah.

35:40.571 --> 35:42.304
Get in.

35:42.306 --> 35:44.473
Night.

35:44.475 --> 35:45.507
- Night.
- Night.

35:45.509 --> 35:47.777
Night. Nice to meet you.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.947
You look like Ed Sheeran,
you know.

35:52.049 --> 35:54.317
I am Ed Sheeran.

35:54.319 --> 35:56.855
Oh, right. Well done.

35:58.855 --> 36:00.489
Light show?

36:00.491 --> 36:02.023
- Preferably not, no.
- Well, that's good,

36:02.025 --> 36:04.726
'cause I've only got the torch
on my phone, so...

36:04.728 --> 36:06.061
Have you got any beer?

36:06.063 --> 36:07.730
Uh, cider.

36:07.732 --> 36:09.565
- Cider works.
- Okay.

36:09.567 --> 36:12.367
I'll have a cider with the man
that wrote "Yesterday."

36:12.369 --> 36:14.103
Yeah.

36:14.105 --> 36:17.639
Mum, Dad,
who drunk all the cider?

36:17.641 --> 36:19.541
<i>- That is nuts!
- Yeah, as you said, it's nutty.</i>

36:19.543 --> 36:22.411
And he's absolutely covered
in tattoos.

36:22.413 --> 36:23.612
Nice dressing gown, by the way.

36:23.614 --> 36:25.880
No, it's not. No.

36:25.882 --> 36:27.717
Don't. Don't start.

36:27.719 --> 36:29.819
It looked so good online,
so I just ordered it,

36:29.821 --> 36:31.920
and the most disgusting pink
thing in history turns up.

36:31.922 --> 36:34.824
- So good.
- Meanwhile, you need a new roadie.

36:34.826 --> 36:35.958
Tomorrow.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.460
What do you mean?
You're not coming?

36:37.462 --> 36:40.529
No, of course not.

36:40.531 --> 36:42.565
I'm, you know, a schoolteacher.

36:42.567 --> 36:43.898
I teach maths.

36:43.900 --> 36:45.067
I can't suddenly manage

36:45.069 --> 36:47.036
Ed Sheeran's support act.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.837
Yeah, maybe you can, though.

36:48.839 --> 36:51.373
Um... yeah.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.375
Well, I certainly can't do it
this Tuesday.

36:53.377 --> 36:55.878
'Cause we've got a parent-
teacher's evening at 6:45.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.679
And, although I like you, I...

36:57.681 --> 37:00.583
I don't like you enough to let
down the whole of year ten.

37:00.585 --> 37:03.418
- Right. Okay.
- Sorry.

37:03.420 --> 37:05.121
Lucy, Ellie's resigned
from her post.

37:05.123 --> 37:07.989
Do you fancy being my roadie
in Moscow on Tuesday?

37:07.991 --> 37:10.025
Sorry. Would love to,

37:10.027 --> 37:11.927
but we've got rehearsals
for the school play.

37:11.929 --> 37:13.462
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

37:13.464 --> 37:16.165
Let's think, plan C.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.500
- Oh, no.
- What?

37:18.502 --> 37:20.469

it was Jack Malik!

40:28.025 --> 40:30.592
And now are you ready

40:30.594 --> 40:33.895
for Ed Sheeran?!

40:38.735 --> 40:41.670
On a three-hour plane journey,
without a guitar?

40:41.672 --> 40:43.938
Yeah.

40:43.940 --> 40:45.674
'Cause I thought
we were going to Russia,

40:45.676 --> 40:47.208
so I should write a song
about Russia.

40:47.210 --> 40:49.311
Yeah, that... I just,
I thought it was really cool

40:49.313 --> 40:50.878
that you called it "USSR,"
you know?

40:50.880 --> 40:52.146
It probably stopped
being called that

40:52.148 --> 40:53.215
before you were born.

40:53.217 --> 40:55.016
Yeah.

40:55.018 --> 40:56.652
Amazing, man.

40:56.654 --> 40:58.853
- Loved that USSR track.
- Thanks.

40:58.855 --> 41:01.056
Right. I've got an idea.

41:01.058 --> 41:03.891
Everyone, I think we can all
agree that we're impressed

41:03.893 --> 41:05.293
with Jack's songwriting talent,
right?

41:05.295 --> 41:06.996
- Whoo-hoo!
- - So, here's the plan.

41:06.998 --> 41:09.998
I'm gonna go out that door,
Jack's gonna go out this door.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.201
And whoever writes the
best song in ten minutes, wins.

41:14.904 --> 41:16.070
What's the prize?

41:16.072 --> 41:18.806
No prize.
Just being the best songwriter.

41:18.808 --> 41:23.344
Jack "Back in the USSR" Malik,
are you in?

41:23.346 --> 41:25.648
- Okay.
- Okay.

41:25.650 --> 41:26.748
And it can't be anything
you've written before.

41:26.750 --> 41:27.949
Like, nothing
in your bottom drawer.

41:27.951 --> 41:29.217
Has to be new, tonight.

41:29.219 --> 41:31.052
- Right.
- Cool.

41:31.054 --> 41:32.721
- Fun.
- I still,

41:32.723 --> 41:34.255
still think
there should be a prize, Ed.

41:34.257 --> 41:37.393
I mean, with all his money,
he could afford a tenner.

44:19.456 --> 44:21.023
No. That was, uh,

44:21.025 --> 44:24.492
an interesting moment.

44:24.494 --> 44:26.460
I was always told that
there would be someone

44:26.462 --> 44:28.096
who came along that was
a lot better than me,

44:28.098 --> 44:31.400
and you are definitely
better than me, Jack.

44:31.402 --> 44:33.569
Yeah, wow.
That was, uh,

44:33.571 --> 44:35.603
one of the best songs
I've heard in my life.

44:35.605 --> 44:37.940
I mean, these things
are complicated.

44:37.942 --> 44:39.942
Yeah.

44:39.944 --> 44:43.110
Obviously not complicated
for you, though, right?

44:43.112 --> 44:44.913
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

44:44.915 --> 44:47.114
Someone should probably shag
him while they have the chance.

44:47.116 --> 44:48.616
- - Yeah.
- Pick me, Jack!

44:48.618 --> 44:49.951
You're definitely Mozart, mate.

44:49.953 --> 44:52.020
And I'm definitely Salieri.

44:52.022 --> 44:53.190

45:00.163 --> 45:02.563

45:02.565 --> 45:04.532
I'm Ed's manager.

45:04.534 --> 45:06.268
We should talk.

45:06.270 --> 45:08.302
Yeah. I... Well, I g... I mean,

45:08.304 --> 45:10.271
- I've kind of got a manager back home.
- Oh?

45:10.273 --> 45:11.505
No, but, but no,
but we should talk.

45:11.507 --> 45:14.275
- Yeah.

45:14.277 --> 45:15.878

I'll see you in Los Angeles.

45:19.250 --> 45:20.882
In Los Angeles?

45:20.884 --> 45:24.085
Yeah, well, we, we need you
to come to L.A.

45:24.087 --> 45:28.891
See, we pay and then you come
and you write songs

45:28.893 --> 45:31.960
and then we release them,
and you make a ton of money.

45:31.962 --> 45:34.496
And then we take most of it.

45:37.534 --> 45:39.300
Okay.

45:39.302 --> 45:41.103
I have a question.

45:41.105 --> 45:43.141
Is this the best

45:45.542 --> 45:47.308

I did try to teach you.
I did try to teach you.

46:06.397 --> 46:08.697
- Honestly, no, you can have the job back.
- No, thanks.

46:08.699 --> 46:11.300
Why would anyone ever leave Suffolk

46:11.302 --> 46:12.634
before the day they die?

46:14.138 --> 46:17.706
Right, but if you must go
to Los Angeles

46:17.708 --> 46:20.608
- and hang out with perverts and drug addicts...
- I must.

46:20.610 --> 46:22.311
...then we wish you
good luck and success.

46:22.313 --> 46:24.947
Or, even better, failure

46:24.949 --> 46:26.480
and a swift return.

46:26.482 --> 46:28.150
Failure and a swift return!

46:28.152 --> 46:30.554
Yay!

46:33.556 --> 46:35.456
Will you miss me, Jack?

46:35.458 --> 46:37.125
Course I'll miss you.

46:37.127 --> 46:39.494
Hey.

46:39.496 --> 46:40.498
Of course I'll miss you.

46:43.600 --> 46:46.971
You're leaving, so...
I can ask you anything.

46:55.011 --> 46:57.281
How did I get
in the wrong column?

46:59.350 --> 47:01.349
How did I get in

47:01.351 --> 47:04.288
the "friend, manager, roadie"
column, inst...

47:06.556 --> 47:10.093
...instead of the
"And I Love Her" column?

47:12.362 --> 47:15.130
What are you doing up there?

47:15.132 --> 47:17.565
Come on. If you don't
come downstairs soon,

47:17.567 --> 47:19.333
your mum will be too drunk
to make her speech.

47:19.335 --> 47:20.855
- Jack!
- Coming, Ellie Wellie?

47:21.672 --> 47:24.373
- Yeah.
- Come on down, my baby bunny, we miss you!

47:24.375 --> 47:26.675
- Jack!
- Ellie! - Jack! -Jack!

47:26.677 --> 47:28.409
Jackie, what are you
doing up there?

47:28.411 --> 47:30.612
Oh, God.
Are those definitely columns?

47:30.614 --> 47:33.447
Jack!

47:33.449 --> 47:35.317
Well, a girl can certainly
tell the difference.

47:37.321 --> 47:39.121
- Jack!
- It...

47:39.123 --> 47:40.654

48:53.730 --> 48:57.465
Welcome to
my little beach shack.

48:57.467 --> 49:00.168
Thank you
for coming all this way.

49:00.170 --> 49:03.371
Good to see you. Well...

49:03.373 --> 49:07.275
- you're not very attractive.
- No.

49:07.277 --> 49:09.344
- You're out of shape.
- Yes.

49:09.346 --> 49:11.480
You're skinny,
yet, somehow, round.

49:11.482 --> 49:12.683
Uh-huh.

49:13.784 --> 49:16.884
You have been profoundly
unsuccessful for ten years.

49:16.886 --> 49:20.322
- Yep.
- And until about a month ago,

49:20.324 --> 49:22.389
we'd call you
a complete failure.

49:22.391 --> 49:24.826
Well, that's not quite
how I'd put it, but...

49:24.828 --> 49:27.228
- We would say that you were a complete failure.
- Yeah.

49:27.230 --> 49:28.663
Sit, please.

49:28.665 --> 49:32.300
But now, now...

49:32.302 --> 49:35.837
you've hit an extraordinary
songwriting groove,

49:35.839 --> 49:38.440
and you want to be the biggest
star in the world.

49:38.442 --> 49:41.543
- Well, mmm...
- "Yes" is the answer to that question.

49:41.545 --> 49:42.543
Well, yes, I guess.

49:42.545 --> 49:44.545
Not, "Well, yes, I guess."

49:44.547 --> 49:46.083
"Yes."

49:47.618 --> 49:48.750
I guess.

I need to hear you say,
"Debra, I'm so thirsty.

50:18.415 --> 50:20.851

52:12.395 --> 52:14.295

52:14.297 --> 52:15.563
I hadn't given up smoking.

52:15.565 --> 52:18.833
I could just murder
a cigarette.

52:24.907 --> 52:27.244
What?

52:36.752 --> 52:38.989
Wow.

52:43.025 --> 52:46.895
Uh... oh, yes, Jack,
this is Hilary.

52:46.897 --> 52:49.331
She's gonna be working
with you on your image.

52:49.333 --> 52:51.032
Do I have to have an image?

52:51.034 --> 52:52.766
Well, if you don't
have an image,

52:52.768 --> 52:56.538
- then the lack of image becomes an image.
- Right.

52:56.540 --> 52:58.373
And the music sounds so joyful.

52:58.375 --> 53:01.076
It'd be a shame to let it down
by you being so...

53:01.078 --> 53:03.978
- off-putting.
- Mm-hmm.

53:03.980 --> 53:06.614
I can see how you two
might be friends.

53:07.951 --> 53:09.516
Yeah, yeah.

59:04.873 --> 59:08.009
I am gonna have fish and chips.

59:08.011 --> 59:09.079
But I'm on a diet.

59:10.045 --> 59:11.846
So, salad instead of the fries.

59:11.848 --> 59:14.081
I'll have the grilled salmon,
and again,

59:14.083 --> 59:15.416
with a salad, no fries.

59:15.418 --> 59:16.717
Anything else?

59:16.719 --> 59:18.186
Maybe just a side of fries.

59:18.188 --> 59:20.721
- Yeah, make that two. And lots more beers.
- Thanks.

59:20.723 --> 59:22.389
I guess the girls are falling
over themselves

59:22.391 --> 59:24.092
to sleep with you,
now you're a famous musician?

59:24.094 --> 59:27.128
I'm not famous. And no, not yet.

59:27.130 --> 59:29.262
Although there was one Russian.

59:29.264 --> 59:31.232
That's nice.
Was she stocky?

59:31.234 --> 59:33.333
Fairly stocky, yeah.

59:33.335 --> 59:35.503
- Bar's closing. Can I get you anything else?
- No, thanks.

59:35.505 --> 59:36.904
Maybe just a couple
of brandies.

59:36.906 --> 59:38.505
And lots of chocolates.

59:38.507 --> 59:40.007
What are we gonna do
when they throw us out?

59:40.009 --> 59:42.976
I was thinking...
lots of ketamine.

59:42.978 --> 59:45.145
- Mmm.
- And then, wandering the streets

59:45.147 --> 59:47.849
of Liverpool, singing songs
we don't know the lyrics of.

59:47.851 --> 59:50.851
Very loudly.

59:50.853 --> 59:52.853
You've changed.

59:55.458 --> 59:58.860
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh. ♪

01:00:16.078 --> 01:00:17.214
Hello?

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.884
Whoo!

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:25.253
So, where's your room?

01:00:25.255 --> 01:00:27.424
Oh, definitely,
definitely not on this floor.

01:00:29.558 --> 01:00:31.558
Do-na-noo-na-noo-na.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.795
- Da-na-na-do...
- Do-na-noo-na.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

01:00:40.002 --> 01:00:42.438
Hmm.

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:49.480
- Long pause.
- Yeah.

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:54.348
Have I messed up massively?

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:55.817
- Meaning what?
- Going away, and...

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:58.251
Oh, no. God, no.

01:00:58.253 --> 01:01:00.887
What was the alternative?

01:01:00.889 --> 01:01:03.324
This is the most wonderful

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.226
and exciting thing
in the world.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:12.269
Can I maybe
turn out the light?

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:16.773
Maybe.

01:01:45.268 --> 01:01:47.134
Mistake?

01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:48.938
Probably.

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:02.083
Oh, my God, you just...
you touched my bottom.

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:04.951
You've never done that before.

01:02:04.953 --> 01:02:06.286
Well, I imagine
we're gonna have to do

01:02:06.288 --> 01:02:07.991
a lot of things
we've never done before.

01:02:10.592 --> 01:02:12.592
Are you sure?

01:02:12.594 --> 01:02:15.496
- And what about you?
- I asked first.

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:17.501
I really don't know.

01:02:33.215 --> 01:02:36.317
Oh, okay.

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:38.219
So, maybe no.

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:39.387
No?

01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:41.154
Um...

01:02:41.156 --> 01:02:43.291
It's certainly not a mistake
coming up to Liverpool.

01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:46.126
Certainly, um,
a lovely evening.

01:02:46.128 --> 01:02:47.929
But I think, probably, it's...

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:51.465
- it's a mistake to go further.
- Okay.

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:54.134
I have a room of my own and...

01:02:54.136 --> 01:02:56.270
and I think, um...

01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:59.340
a one-night stand would be...

01:02:59.342 --> 01:03:02.543
a strange new column
for me to be in, Jack.

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:05.579
Maybe it, it wouldn't be
a one-night stand.

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:07.348
Well, when are you going back
to America?

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:09.616
- Tomorrow.
- So that's one night.

01:03:09.618 --> 01:03:12.652
It's the dictionary definition
of a one-night stand and...

01:03:12.654 --> 01:03:16.123
it's not for me.

01:03:56.264 --> 01:03:57.598
- Let's go!
- What? What? What?

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.132
We've gotta find Ellie!

01:03:59.134 --> 01:04:00.500
- I know where she is.
- Where?

01:04:00.502 --> 01:04:02.036
- In Suffolk, mate.
- No, she's not,

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:04.237
- she's in Liverpool, you numpty.
- Really?

01:04:04.239 --> 01:04:05.405
That's a coincidence.

01:04:05.407 --> 01:04:07.440
Uh, we...

01:04:07.442 --> 01:04:09.076
You have got a guest,
Ellie Appleton.

01:04:09.078 --> 01:04:11.478
Oh, yeah, we just ordered her

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.014
a taxi to the station.

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:14.215
Oh, Christ.

01:04:14.217 --> 01:04:16.116
Uh, thank you very much.

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:21.389
Okay. No, no, no. Okay.

01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:23.456
Double our chances... you go
that way, I'll go this way.

01:04:23.458 --> 01:04:25.462
- Whoever gets there first, stops her.
- Okay.

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:35.136
- Oh, there you are.
- It's that way. It's that way.

01:04:39.409 --> 01:04:41.108
I'm dying.

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:42.710
- Ellie. Elle.
- Oh, my God.

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.110
I hope she's worth it, mate.

01:04:44.112 --> 01:04:47.213
Where's the...?

01:04:47.215 --> 01:04:48.815
D-Does anyone know
what platform goes to London?

01:04:48.817 --> 01:04:50.186
- Six. - Six.
- Eight.

01:04:51.253 --> 01:04:52.764
- No, it's definitely six.
- Oh, yeah, no, it's six.

01:04:52.788 --> 01:04:53.868
It's definitely six. Sorry.

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:57.358
Yes, yes, yes!

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.226
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:05:00.228 --> 01:05:04.532
No. No.

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:08.268
Come on, pick up.
Pick up.

01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:11.304
- Hello?
- Hi, yes.

01:05:11.306 --> 01:05:12.806
I-I came after you,

01:05:12.808 --> 01:05:14.775
but I missed the train.

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:16.444
I'm sorry.

01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:18.512
- We need to talk.
- Let's talk.

01:05:18.514 --> 01:05:21.114
- Where are you?
- Right behind you.

01:05:21.116 --> 01:05:22.148
Having a cheese
and tomato baguette

01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:23.150
and a packet of crisps.

01:05:29.157 --> 01:05:30.791
Jack, would it, would it be

01:05:30.793 --> 01:05:32.460
annoying of me to point out
we should be

01:05:32.462 --> 01:05:33.828
- heading for the airport?
- How long have we got?

01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:35.632
Well, in real terms,
minus an hour.

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:42.369
Okay.

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:44.337
Rocky, this is completely not
a conversation you're part of.

01:05:44.339 --> 01:05:45.405
- No, of course it's not.
- Yeah.

01:05:45.407 --> 01:05:46.407
No, deeply private.

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:48.708
With your future happiness
at stake.

01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:50.311
Right, did you two
sleep together last night?

01:05:50.313 --> 01:05:52.112
- No.
- No. - What a waste.

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:53.646
Anyway, I'll keep an eye
on the clock.

01:05:53.648 --> 01:05:55.618
You've got precisely
four minutes.

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:01.788
- So...
- So... -

01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:03.791
Um...

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:05.492
it's about last night.

01:06:05.494 --> 01:06:08.362
What about it?

01:06:08.364 --> 01:06:10.697
Well, it was almost
quite a moment.

01:06:10.699 --> 01:06:12.766
And I woke up, and I panicked.
And I wanted to talk.

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:15.436
Okay, then talk.

01:06:15.438 --> 01:06:17.438
Right.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.608
So, um...

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:23.878
N...
'cause we...

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.512
And how do you think
it's going so far?

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:26.514
It's not great, but...

01:06:26.516 --> 01:06:29.583
No, no, let me try and help.

01:06:29.585 --> 01:06:33.454
You've had 20 years
to make your move.

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:37.291
Well, I couldn't exactly make
my move when I was seven.

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:40.226
Then you've had ten years.

01:06:40.228 --> 01:06:43.329
Right. Well, we've always been
like brother and sister.

01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:47.300
It's very bad indeed for...

01:06:47.302 --> 01:06:49.302
for brothers and sisters
to have sex.

01:06:49.304 --> 01:06:50.804
- Except that we're not brother and sister.
- No, exactly.

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:52.672
- Right, but...
- No, so...

01:06:52.674 --> 01:06:55.942
I've been waiting half my life

01:06:55.944 --> 01:06:58.214
for you to wake up and love me.

01:07:01.683 --> 01:07:04.384
Having loved you
for half a lifetime,

01:07:04.386 --> 01:07:05.719
I realized when you left,

01:07:05.721 --> 01:07:07.621
that I had made a bad choice
doing that.

01:07:09.592 --> 01:07:11.257
And now, it's got
even trickier because...

01:07:11.259 --> 01:07:13.793
if...

01:07:13.795 --> 01:07:15.795
When you were playing in pubs,
we were the perfect match.

01:07:15.797 --> 01:07:17.665
But now...

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:19.833
I-I...

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:22.636
I'm an actual schoolteacher
in actual Lowestoft,

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:25.505
and you're the world's greatest
singer-songwriter.

01:07:25.507 --> 01:07:27.708
- No, I'm not.
- Except that you probably are.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:30.210
Okay. Two minutes, ladies
and gentlemen, two minutes.

01:07:30.212 --> 01:07:32.947
Also, um...
Debra's on my phone for you.

01:07:32.949 --> 01:07:34.648
Apparently, she's having dinner
with the head of the label

01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:35.916
and you're meant to be
FaceTiming in, so...

01:07:35.918 --> 01:07:36.916
Just go away, Rocky.

01:07:36.918 --> 01:07:38.485
Okay. One minute, 53.

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:39.789
In the end, to you,

01:07:40.989 --> 01:07:43.757
I'll always, really, just be
Ellie with the frizzy hair.

01:07:43.759 --> 01:07:46.626
And Ellie from
the "Fun chum" column.

01:07:46.628 --> 01:07:49.630
Ellie, who, for reasons
no one understands,

01:07:49.632 --> 01:07:53.467
drives you around in her car.

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:55.636
So, just go and please
just catch your plane.

01:07:56.938 --> 01:07:59.907
We haven't finished
the conversation.

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:03.009
Well, um, we have.

01:08:03.011 --> 01:08:05.779
We have.

01:08:05.781 --> 01:08:07.848
Unless...

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:10.951
in Liverpool Lime Street at...

01:08:10.953 --> 01:08:14.355
11:14 on a Friday...

01:08:14.357 --> 01:08:17.893
unless you choose to stay.

01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:27.399
Jack.

01:08:27.402 --> 01:08:29.636
Jack. You have to
get on the plane.

01:08:29.638 --> 01:08:32.573
- What are you still doing in Liverpool?
- I can't stay today.

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:34.774
I've gotta do
<i>The Late Late Show</i> tomorrow,

01:08:34.776 --> 01:08:36.676
and I've gotta do the
Marketing Meeting of Meetings

01:08:36.678 --> 01:08:39.813
- and, oh, it's ridiculous...
- And that was your chance.

01:08:39.814 --> 01:08:41.782
Now, quick, go.

01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:43.252
Please, leave.

01:08:44.419 --> 01:08:46.618
- Sorry.
- Hey, do you mind if I nick a couple of crisps

01:08:46.721 --> 01:08:48.800
- for the journey?
- Look, I want you to be happy and,

01:08:48.823 --> 01:08:51.558
and to make marvelous music.
I always have.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.493
- No, not all the crisps!
- Okay.

01:08:53.495 --> 01:08:54.961
Just go, go, go, go, go.

01:08:54.962 --> 01:08:57.796
Your, your future is
o-out the door and to the left.

01:08:57.799 --> 01:08:59.535
A taxi rank.

01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:06.974
I'm sorry.

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:09.011
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm so...

01:09:22.457 --> 01:09:24.692
<i>Okay. Welcome to the Major</i>

01:09:24.694 --> 01:09:26.725
<i>Marketing Meeting of Meetings.</i>

01:09:26.728 --> 01:09:30.564
<i>So amazing to have Jack himself
right here in the building.</i>

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:32.269
<i>Give it up for Jack, y'all.</i>

01:09:36.471 --> 01:09:39.506
Now, uh, Jack, I,

01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:41.809
I do believe I speak for
everyone in attendance today

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.844
when I say...

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:47.081
- it is the climax of our careers...
- Yes!

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:50.783
...to be working on this
mind-bending album with you.

01:09:50.785 --> 01:09:52.452
Give it up, y'all.

01:09:54.122 --> 01:09:56.422
Yeah!

01:09:56.424 --> 01:09:58.591
You, you don't have to clap
every time.

01:09:58.593 --> 01:09:59.760
But thanks very much.

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:01.362
Mr. Modesty!

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:03.663
- Give it up for modesty!
- No, seriously, d...

01:10:03.665 --> 01:10:06.100
That's what he does
right off the top.

01:10:06.102 --> 01:10:08.935
Now, as you all know,
the songs we released online

01:10:08.937 --> 01:10:12.005
have created
unprecedented excitement.

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:13.073
Yes.

01:10:13.075 --> 01:10:14.808
- Yes.
- No.

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:16.476
So, now upon us falls

01:10:16.478 --> 01:10:20.046
the mighty task of packaging
everything together

01:10:20.048 --> 01:10:23.783
into one single,
irresistible album.

01:10:23.785 --> 01:10:26.686
Now, Jack came up with some
title suggestions himself

01:10:26.688 --> 01:10:30.556
and, uh,
we worked on some of those.

01:10:30.558 --> 01:10:32.559
You know, I especially
got a kick out of

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:35.996
<i>Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band.</i>

01:10:35.998 --> 01:10:37.797
Yeah, that's...

01:10:37.799 --> 01:10:39.533
It's okay to laugh,
'cause it's funny.

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:42.935
It is. It's, uh,
a lot of words, Jack.

01:10:42.937 --> 01:10:46.038
But ultimately, in the end,
we just felt it was, uh,

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.175
uh, too confusing, right?

01:10:48.177 --> 01:10:49.943
Too confusing. And, uh,

01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:54.747
<i>The White Album</i>
has some diversity issues.

01:10:54.749 --> 01:10:56.417
How?

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:59.552
That's a lot of white, Jack.

01:10:59.554 --> 01:11:02.723
And I know you were
pretty enthusiastic

01:11:02.725 --> 01:11:05.525
about <i>Abbey Road.</i>
I gotta say,

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:07.161
it didn't have a lot
going for it...

01:11:07.163 --> 01:11:08.796
if I can put it to you
like that.

01:11:08.798 --> 01:11:11.030
Uh, it's just a road,
with a bunch of people

01:11:11.032 --> 01:11:13.033
driving down the wrong side
of the street.

01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:15.689
That's not exactly
what I meant, but...

01:11:16.804 --> 01:11:17.738
But we've been developing
some ideas of our own, now.

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:18.838
You know, we weren't just
sitting around.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:22.576
We focused on the one thing
that makes this man here

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:26.613
unlike anyone else in the
entire world of music today.

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:30.184
No collaborators, no cowriters,
no samples, no steals, hmm?

01:11:30.186 --> 01:11:32.752
No "featuring Cardi B,"

01:11:32.754 --> 01:11:36.189
no "featuring Bieber."

01:11:36.191 --> 01:11:39.993
Just the simple, pure genius...

01:11:39.995 --> 01:11:41.627
of <i>One Man Only.</i>

01:11:41.629 --> 01:11:43.831
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:48.601
And, as a second wave,
because of the miracle

01:11:48.603 --> 01:11:51.604
that is <i>One Man Only,</i>
it's just this.

01:11:51.606 --> 01:11:54.207
Just this.

01:11:54.209 --> 01:11:56.476
Mmm, mmm. I know.

01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:57.610
I know.

01:11:57.612 --> 01:12:00.980
So, let Operation Jack begin!

01:12:00.982 --> 01:12:02.216
Each week, a new song online.

01:12:02.218 --> 01:12:03.917
Each week, a new TV show.

01:12:03.919 --> 01:12:06.019
We start with Corden,
then we move to Kimmel,

01:12:06.021 --> 01:12:07.820
then Fallon, then Colbert

01:12:07.822 --> 01:12:11.190
and then <i>Thursday Night Live!</i>

01:12:11.192 --> 01:12:12.658
Whoo!

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:14.961
Song, song, song.
Show, show, show.

01:12:14.963 --> 01:12:16.662
Boom, bang, bazillions.

01:12:16.664 --> 01:12:18.698
Now, let's go make
so much money that,

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:21.001
by this time next Christmas,
we are wiping our asses

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:23.069
with solid-gold toilet paper.

01:12:23.071 --> 01:12:24.837
<i>Ladies
and gentlemen, please welcome,</i>

01:12:24.839 --> 01:12:28.074
the one, the only, Mr. Jack Malik!

01:12:28.076 --> 01:12:30.711
<i>Jack, I'm such a fan.
It's great to meet you.</i>

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:32.746
<i>Thank you for being here.</i>

01:12:32.748 --> 01:12:34.046
<i>The songs of yours
that I've heard, they are,</i>

01:12:34.048 --> 01:12:35.748
<i>they're amazing.</i>

01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:37.818
What's life like for you
at the moment right now?

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:40.119
I mean, the expectation
for the album

01:12:40.121 --> 01:12:42.055
is just rising
to insane levels, isn't it?

01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:44.091
Yeah, well, they're...
they're insane to me.

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:46.827
I mean, who here's excited
about this album?

01:12:46.829 --> 01:12:48.095
Listen to that.

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:51.797
In this age of,
sometimes, 16 people

01:12:51.799 --> 01:12:54.801
writing on one song,
suddenly, here's a guy,

01:12:54.803 --> 01:12:59.973
him and a guitar, and he writes
everything himself, on his own.

01:12:59.975 --> 01:13:02.015
Yeah. I mean... Well, you know,
that's how it always

01:13:02.410 --> 01:13:04.323
used to be, though, with,
uh, with, like, James Taylor

01:13:04.347 --> 01:13:05.711
or Stevie Wonder,
Bruce Springsteen.

01:13:05.713 --> 01:13:07.146
So I don't think
it's that exceptional.

01:13:07.148 --> 01:13:08.247
But is it just you?

01:13:08.249 --> 01:13:11.984
Well, yes.

01:13:11.986 --> 01:13:15.188
But is it?

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:17.090
Well, y-yes.

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:19.025
- Yes, it is.
- Excellent.

01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:20.993
Because as chance would
have it, a-and do forgive me,

01:13:20.995 --> 01:13:24.297
because we-we love a surprise
on this show.

01:13:24.299 --> 01:13:26.065
As chance would
darn well have it,

01:13:26.067 --> 01:13:29.670
I've got two men backstage

01:13:29.672 --> 01:13:31.171
who claim that the songs
are theirs.

01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:35.975
In fact, they say that all
of your tunes

01:13:35.977 --> 01:13:41.280
are the work of their band,
The Beatles.

01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:45.318
I d... I don't know...

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.988
I don't...

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:51.190
Well, let's see how this
plays out, shall we?

01:13:51.192 --> 01:13:52.592
Ladies and gentlemen,
all the way

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:54.060
from Liverpool, England,
please welcome,

01:13:54.062 --> 01:13:56.762
Mr. Paul McCartney
and Mr. Ringo Starr!

01:14:09.277 --> 01:14:12.679

Hey.

Bang me backwards over a Buick.

01:14:20.188 --> 01:14:23.657
It's gonna be the greatest
album of all time.

01:14:23.659 --> 01:14:25.324
It's really incredible, man.

01:14:25.326 --> 01:14:27.027
- Hey, Ed.
- How you doing? Um, I'm just in town for a couple

01:14:27.029 --> 01:14:29.930
of days. I thought I'd come
and see the genius at work.

01:14:29.932 --> 01:14:32.099
I'm just trying to
work out your process.

01:14:32.101 --> 01:14:33.399
Is it music first
or lyrics first?

01:14:33.401 --> 01:14:34.467
Um, it varies.

01:14:34.469 --> 01:14:36.970
But, like, with this song,
for instance, the, um,

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:38.404
the-the "Hey Jude" one

01:14:38.406 --> 01:14:40.640
must have some story behind it.

01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:42.708
Well, yeah.
No, it do... it does.

01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:46.680
So, it was the son
of a friend of mine

01:14:46.682 --> 01:14:48.348
who was having a hard time.

01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:50.751
Um, it, it, it just,

01:14:50.753 --> 01:14:54.624
it came to me as a s...
as a song of comfort.

01:14:57.892 --> 01:14:59.261
I don't believe you.

01:15:00.862 --> 01:15:02.194
What?

01:15:02.196 --> 01:15:05.265
I mean, I just...
I don't believe you.

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:07.868
- It's one genius idea after the other, you know?
- Oh, right.

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:09.235
I do have a suggestion, though.

01:15:09.237 --> 01:15:11.304
Um, about the song.

01:15:11.306 --> 01:15:13.806
The-the title, "Hey Jude."

01:15:13.808 --> 01:15:16.743
Jude is just,
it's a bit old-fashioned.

01:15:16.745 --> 01:15:19.246
- That was the kid's name, right?
- What kid?

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:21.381
- That the song's about.
- Oh, the kid, the kid, the kid.

01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:23.283
Yes, the-the... the sad kid.

01:15:23.285 --> 01:15:26.353
Now, l-let me just
give you this advice, right?

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:27.953
Song title...

01:15:27.955 --> 01:15:30.157
I won't charge you a penny
for it as well...

01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:33.329
"Hey Dude."

He's right. That's...
that's so much better.

01:15:46.275 --> 01:15:48.041
Is he?

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:49.743
- Is it?

- Yes. Mm-hmm.

01:15:54.415 --> 01:15:56.248
one of the best songs
of the generation.

01:15:56.250 --> 01:15:58.385

01:16:05.026 --> 01:16:06.393
Oh, sorry, guys.
I gotta take this.

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:07.827
Just give me a minute, Ed.
Sorry.

01:16:07.829 --> 01:16:08.994
- Elle.
- Jack.

01:16:08.996 --> 01:16:10.096
I'm so glad you called.

01:16:10.098 --> 01:16:11.465
I'm not enjoying myself here
at all.

01:16:11.467 --> 01:16:12.498
Oh, right. Well, um...

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.467
I've got two bits of news.

01:16:14.469 --> 01:16:16.002
I'm riveted.

01:16:16.004 --> 01:16:18.738
All right.
Well, the first one...

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:21.073
- big one.
- Yeah?

01:16:21.075 --> 01:16:23.476
The Pier Hotel.

01:16:23.478 --> 01:16:25.045
What? In Gorleston?
The place that

01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:26.846
closed down rather than
have me play?

01:16:26.848 --> 01:16:28.782
Yes. It's reopening.

01:16:28.784 --> 01:16:29.649
You're bloody kidding.

01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:31.818
I am bloody not.
It's re-bloody opening.

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:33.153
That's amazing!

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:34.887
That's huge news!

01:16:34.889 --> 01:16:37.424
That's-that's-that's
ma-bloody-ssive!

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:39.391
All right, what's the second?

01:16:39.393 --> 01:16:41.827
I mean, it can't be as big.
But tell me anyway.

01:16:41.829 --> 01:16:44.396
Um...

01:16:44.398 --> 01:16:47.000
n-number two is...

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:49.371
I've been seeing someone.

01:16:51.205 --> 01:16:52.708
Right.

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:56.542
Do I know him?

01:16:56.544 --> 01:16:59.345
Yeah. It's Gavin.

01:16:59.347 --> 01:17:02.118
I-I didn't want you to find out
from someone else.

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.354
Every day,

01:17:07.356 --> 01:17:09.389
he puts me in the right column.

01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:11.257
Of course.

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:12.559
The "true love" one.

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:14.864
Of course.

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:17.898
I've gotta go.

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.832
Ah, God.
Yeah, course you do.

01:17:19.834 --> 01:17:22.270
Um, okay. Bye. Bye.

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:31.010
What? What could possibly
be so urgent

01:17:31.012 --> 01:17:33.046
that I can't make
a single phone call?!

01:17:33.048 --> 01:17:35.282
How the hell am I supposed to
get any of the songs right

01:17:35.284 --> 01:17:37.250
if you're just
all clustering me

01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:39.286
and stopping me
from being creative?

01:17:39.288 --> 01:17:42.924
How can I ever be creative
if I'm never ever left alone?!

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.827
Okay.

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:49.296
We'll leave you alone then,
genius.

01:17:49.298 --> 01:17:51.463
No, I'm not... I'm sorry.

01:17:51.465 --> 01:17:55.435
No, it's g... It's, uh,
it's superstar rights.

01:17:55.437 --> 01:17:58.337
Treat the people that you work
with like shit on your shoes.

01:17:58.339 --> 01:17:59.407
Hmm.

01:18:06.548 --> 01:18:08.113
Ellie told you the news, then?

01:18:08.115 --> 01:18:10.850
- Yeah.
- You know, I never, never understood

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:12.418
what you didn't see in her.

01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:13.619
I mean, I-if I'd been you,

01:18:13.621 --> 01:18:18.591
twice a day I would have loved
her up like a lusty lion.

01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:20.926
Rocky, if I ask you
to just shut up,

01:18:20.928 --> 01:18:24.396
really, really, really shut up,
would that be okay?

01:18:24.398 --> 01:18:26.166
Right.

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:29.903
Can I just start again and say,
"Isn't it wonderful news?

01:18:29.905 --> 01:18:32.037
"And I hope they'll be
very happy together

01:18:32.039 --> 01:18:34.174
and have gorgeous kids."
Is that better?

01:18:34.176 --> 01:18:36.042
No. It's worse.

01:18:36.044 --> 01:18:37.644
I have got a third option.
But...

01:18:37.646 --> 01:18:41.046
I'm sorry.
Um, I'm really sorry, everyone.

01:18:41.048 --> 01:18:43.350
I'm just...

01:18:43.352 --> 01:18:45.051
I'm really stressed.

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:47.420
What was so urgent?

01:18:47.422 --> 01:18:49.655
Oh, um, no, nothing.

01:18:49.657 --> 01:18:52.626
It's just we have to
decide today where and when

01:18:52.628 --> 01:18:54.461
we're going to
launch the album.

01:18:54.463 --> 01:18:58.265
So, nothing big, apart from
probably the biggest decision

01:18:58.267 --> 01:19:00.000
of your stupid life.

01:19:00.002 --> 01:19:02.903
- What?
- You ass.

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:05.137
I do have one thought.

01:19:05.139 --> 01:19:06.506
<i>And the little town</i>

01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:10.042
<i>of Gorleston has never seen
anything like this before.</i>

01:19:10.044 --> 01:19:14.014
At 3:00 p.m. today, on the
rooftop of the Pier Hotel,

01:19:14.016 --> 01:19:17.583
Jack Malik, local boy
turned pop phenomenon,

01:19:17.585 --> 01:19:21.320
will premiere his highly
anticipated first album.

01:19:21.322 --> 01:19:22.988
And word seems to have got out.

01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:36.002
Can we, uh...?

01:19:36.004 --> 01:19:38.037
Wow. Look at this.

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:39.204
Look at you.

01:19:39.206 --> 01:19:41.541
Didn't want to disturb.

01:19:41.543 --> 01:19:43.342
Just wanted to, you know...

01:19:43.344 --> 01:19:46.112
Well, it's...
Who'd have thought?

01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:47.314
While we were downstairs

01:19:47.316 --> 01:19:48.648
drinking cider
and eating jelly,

01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:51.984
you were up in your room
writing "She Loves You."

01:19:51.986 --> 01:19:53.219
Well...

01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:55.587
Are you, uh,
you playing our song?

01:19:55.589 --> 01:19:58.123
- Your song?
- "Let It Be."

01:19:58.125 --> 01:19:59.426
Oh, well, we've never forgotten

01:19:59.428 --> 01:20:00.961
we were the first people
to hear it.

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:03.296
Well, the start of it,
at least.

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:05.497
Three times.

01:20:05.499 --> 01:20:07.266
So proud.

01:20:07.268 --> 01:20:11.641
Our beautiful, blazing boy.

01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:16.342
- Aw. Oh.
- Aw. Still, don't wanna...

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:18.478
- Mind your suit, love. It's... blue.
- Yeah.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.514
- We'll leave you to it.
- Okay.

01:20:21.516 --> 01:20:24.617
One last thing, son.

01:20:24.619 --> 01:20:27.252
Yeah, Dad?

01:20:27.254 --> 01:20:29.588
The sandwiches.
I see there's tuna.

01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:31.224
Are y-you gonna finish
them all?

01:20:31.226 --> 01:20:32.524
- No, please take them all.
- Or if you don't...?

01:20:32.526 --> 01:20:37.296
Oh, what a day.
What an amazing day.

01:20:37.298 --> 01:20:38.598
Sorry.

01:20:47.241 --> 01:20:49.676
Jack! Jack! Jack!

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:51.543
Jack! Jack!

01:20:51.545 --> 01:20:55.081
Well, you look good.

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:57.016
That's a tight pant.

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:58.219
Mmm.

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:01.354
Okay.
We've got a jaw and a chin.

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:03.390
Ooh!
That's not bad.

01:21:03.392 --> 01:21:06.493
That's... This'll work.
This'll work. Mmm.

01:21:06.495 --> 01:21:08.161
Don't...

01:21:10.264 --> 01:21:11.663
What? - Nothing.

01:21:11.665 --> 01:21:13.033
Yeah?

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:16.769
- Oh. Hi, Ellie. Come in.
- Hi.

01:21:16.771 --> 01:21:18.671
- And who have we here?
- Um, Debra, this is Ellie.

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:20.073
Ellie, this is Debra, my agent.

01:21:20.075 --> 01:21:21.373
No!

01:21:21.375 --> 01:21:23.676
The Ellie?

01:21:23.678 --> 01:21:25.778
Oh! He's mentioned me?

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.113
No, no. I'm kidding.
I know nothing

01:21:28.115 --> 01:21:30.617
about his life because
he's a product to me.

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:33.787
Unless you're the one
that was his manager.

01:21:33.789 --> 01:21:37.756
In which case, wow.

01:21:37.758 --> 01:21:39.492
Huge mistake giving that up.

01:21:39.494 --> 01:21:42.194
Oh, it's surreal, isn't it?
Being back at the Pier Hotel.

01:21:42.196 --> 01:21:44.096
- Yeah, indeed.
- Oh.

01:21:44.098 --> 01:21:46.498
- I'm gonna go look at the stage, yeah?
- Mm.

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:47.667
- Yeah.
- It's this way.

01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:51.203
Press conference in ten.

01:21:51.205 --> 01:21:52.704
Goodbye, lovebirds.

01:21:54.476 --> 01:21:56.775
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
left Lime Street, okay?

01:21:56.777 --> 01:21:58.644
- It was a terrible mistake.
- Oh, no.

01:21:58.646 --> 01:21:59.813
- Don't say that, please.
- Can we...?

01:21:59.815 --> 01:22:00.814
- Don't say that.
- Elle...

01:22:00.816 --> 01:22:02.314
I-I've heard your new songs.

01:22:02.316 --> 01:22:04.250
- They're incredible.
- O-Okay. No, they aren't.

01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:06.653
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:08.520
Everything changed
after the accident.

01:22:08.522 --> 01:22:10.657
- Wha-What happened?
- Jack.

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:13.359
- And here's Gavin.
- Jack, Jack.

01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:16.328
Jack!

01:22:16.330 --> 01:22:19.299
- Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.
- Oh, hey, mate.

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:20.300
- Jack.
- How you doing, man?

01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:22.801
Jack. Jack.

01:22:22.803 --> 01:22:25.771
- I don't know what to say.
- Oh, really?

01:22:25.773 --> 01:22:27.841
It sounds like you do
and it's, "Jack."

01:22:27.843 --> 01:22:29.708
Jack!

01:22:29.710 --> 01:22:31.810
- Oh...
- We were just coming to say good luck and, um,

01:22:31.812 --> 01:22:34.380
- break a leg.
- Yeah. Well,

01:22:34.382 --> 01:22:36.416
if I fall off the roof,
then a broken leg

01:22:36.418 --> 01:22:37.750
will be a good result.

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:38.818
All right, then. Let's go.

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.487
Come on.

01:22:40.489 --> 01:22:41.557
Ka-ching!

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:52.535
Ellie.

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:07.713
- Ooh.
- Wow.

01:23:07.715 --> 01:23:09.616
Looks pretty quiet.

01:23:09.618 --> 01:23:11.551
Well, maybe we should do
a slightly shorter set?

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:14.487
I mean really quiet.

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:16.588
What do you want?

01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:19.458
Uh, we're here for the gig.
I'm the musician.

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:21.594
Well, that's pretty tricky.

01:23:21.596 --> 01:23:24.430
'Cause we closed
three weeks ago.

01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:26.735
I'd take it as a hint, I would.

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:31.570
<i>I'm gonna have to give up
the part-time jobs,</i>

01:23:31.572 --> 01:23:33.907
go back to teaching.

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:39.278
What?

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.814
No. Don't go back to teaching.

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:42.849
I've got no choice.

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.617
Jack, if you go back
to teaching,

01:23:44.619 --> 01:23:46.685
that is when you've got
no choice.

01:23:46.687 --> 01:23:48.720
Yeah, because you'll end up
putting all your genius

01:23:48.722 --> 01:23:51.256
into all those kids
and then you won't have any

01:23:51.258 --> 01:23:53.960
i-imagination or energy left
to put into your music,

01:23:53.962 --> 01:23:56.229
which really matters.

01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:58.297
Please...

01:23:58.299 --> 01:24:00.433
Okay, okay.

01:24:00.435 --> 01:24:03.836
Crazy, slightly mad woman.

01:24:11.913 --> 01:24:14.613
<i>No one has ever written</i>

01:24:14.615 --> 01:24:17.516
this many great songs
in this short a time.

01:24:17.518 --> 01:24:19.918
- How do you do it?
- Honestly, I don't know.

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:22.521
Sometimes it feels like someone else

01:24:22.523 --> 01:24:24.357
has written all the songs.

01:24:24.359 --> 01:24:25.891
Any idea who?

01:24:25.893 --> 01:24:28.493
What's the inspiration behind

01:24:28.495 --> 01:24:29.828
"Strawberry Fields Forever"?

01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:32.532
- Well...
- Who was your favorite,

01:24:32.534 --> 01:24:34.399
John, Paul, George or Ringo?

01:24:34.401 --> 01:24:37.537
- Sorry?
- Who's your greatest influence?

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:39.338
Jack, is it true that you wrote
"Long and Winding Road" in...

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:41.340
W-Why don't you record in
Abbey Road like they did?

01:24:42.776 --> 01:24:44.877
When can we see
another album, Jack?

01:24:44.879 --> 01:24:46.945
Jack, what's the story
behind "Let it Be"?

01:24:46.947 --> 01:24:48.715
How'd you come up
with "Yesterday"?

01:24:48.717 --> 01:24:50.550
Thank you so much.
We have to go to the roof now.

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:52.284
We'll see you later.

01:24:52.286 --> 01:24:55.354
Jack, what was the first song
you ever wrote?

01:24:55.356 --> 01:24:56.889
Jack, what are you gonna
play for us today?

01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:59.993
It's a nice bar they've got
down there, actually.

01:24:59.995 --> 01:25:01.426
You haven't been drinking,
have you?

01:25:01.428 --> 01:25:04.329
No, I have not.
Well, y-yeah, I have.

01:25:04.331 --> 01:25:06.933
But I find a couple of pints
midday sharpens my senses.

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:10.970
- Oh!
- I'm not sure it does, mate.

01:25:10.972 --> 01:25:14.274
Right, here goes.

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:17.542
Actually, before I open
this door, can I just say,

01:25:17.544 --> 01:25:20.345
for a long time I didn't really
know why I'd been born.

01:25:20.347 --> 01:25:21.514
Felt a bit pointless.

01:25:21.516 --> 01:25:23.015
But now I do know.

01:25:23.017 --> 01:25:27.819
I was born to serve the
greatest musician of all time.

01:25:27.821 --> 01:25:30.890
It is my honor now
to open this door

01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:34.460
for the moment the entire world
has been waiting for.

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:36.298
Thanks, Rock.

01:25:38.365 --> 01:25:41.400
Oh, it's certainly been one
hell of a journey, hasn't it?

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:44.537
So it has. So it has.

01:25:44.539 --> 01:25:46.471
Right.

01:25:46.473 --> 01:25:48.610
Here goes.

01:25:51.879 --> 01:25:54.947
No, that's not...
Uh, wrong door.

01:25:54.949 --> 01:25:58.419
Um, let us, let us continue
our journey together.

01:26:00.521 --> 01:26:02.555
Right.

01:26:02.557 --> 01:26:04.590
Here it does go.

01:26:18.373 --> 01:26:20.105
Jack!

01:26:20.107 --> 01:26:21.940
Jack! Jack! Jack!
Jack! Jack! Jack!

01:26:21.942 --> 01:26:24.443

Thank you, Gorleston!

Jack! Jack! Jack!

01:26:35.423 --> 01:26:36.525

Hey. Uh,

been waiting to see you

01:28:51.892 --> 01:28:55.260
for an hour and they're
genuinely a weird pair.

to sod right off? Or...

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:01.199
No.

No, let 'em in.

I'll be fine.

a little talk.

Yeah.

01:29:21.789 --> 01:29:24.823
'Cause I saw you went to Penny
Lane and Strawberry Fields.

01:29:24.825 --> 01:29:26.125
Yeah.

01:29:34.869 --> 01:29:36.969
- No.
- No.

01:29:36.971 --> 01:29:38.607
I thought as much.

01:29:40.775 --> 01:29:44.580
Well, we just wanted to say
thank you, that's all.

01:29:47.115 --> 01:29:48.680
Thank me?

01:29:48.682 --> 01:29:51.082

thanks very much.

01:29:56.624 --> 01:29:59.594
Myself also.
From bottom of heart.

01:30:01.695 --> 01:30:03.563
Oh, my God!

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:07.198
I thought you were gonna
arrest me, or...

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.835
- No. It's just lovely to hear the songs.
- Yeah.

01:30:09.837 --> 01:30:11.703
I have missed them so.

01:30:11.705 --> 01:30:13.573
Can't remember
any of the lyrics.

01:30:13.575 --> 01:30:15.675
- No. I'm struggling there as well.
- I know.

01:30:15.677 --> 01:30:18.310
"For the Benefit of Mr. Kite's"
in completely the wrong order.

01:30:18.312 --> 01:30:20.211
- Very big mess, indeed.
- Oh, yeah.

01:30:20.213 --> 01:30:23.049
And "Hey Dude"? Really?

01:30:23.051 --> 01:30:24.884
I can't apologize.
It was bloody Ed Sheeran.

01:30:24.886 --> 01:30:26.586
But this is amazing!

01:30:26.588 --> 01:30:27.920
Oh, God!

I-I've been running around

a foreign country and I've
finally bumped into two people

See, here's my take,
young Jack.

01:30:54.382 --> 01:30:57.216
A world without The Beatles,

01:30:57.218 --> 01:31:01.119
is a world
that's infinitely worse.

I'm trying, but it's hard.

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:11.329
There's so much money
and success coming,

01:31:11.331 --> 01:31:14.734
but I feel like I've become
the definition of living a lie.

01:31:14.736 --> 01:31:16.939
Well, I can see it might
feel like that.

01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:27.947
We thought this might help.

But not successful.

01:33:37.178 --> 01:33:39.944
I just said "very happy."

01:33:39.946 --> 01:33:42.247

01:33:55.797 --> 01:33:59.098
Fought hard to keep her, too.

01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:02.137
Lived my life with her.

01:34:03.236 --> 01:34:06.137

artist in the history of music.

01:40:10.170 --> 01:40:12.050
If we could just switch on
the backstage camera.

01:40:17.277 --> 01:40:19.713
- Oh!
- Oh! It's Ellie!

01:40:24.317 --> 01:40:25.716
This is Ellie.

01:40:25.718 --> 01:40:28.287
Hi, Ellie!

01:40:28.289 --> 01:40:33.225
And when I had no fans,
Ellie was my only fan.

01:40:33.227 --> 01:40:35.627
The only person in the world
who believed in me.

01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:37.662
And that's why, tonight,
I asked Ed

01:40:37.664 --> 01:40:38.930
if I could come on and play,

01:40:38.932 --> 01:40:42.333
'cause I want to tell her...
and you,

01:40:42.335 --> 01:40:45.970
- what I've done.
- What are you saying?

01:40:45.972 --> 01:40:48.575
Darn it, Ellie,
I've been untrue.

01:40:52.646 --> 01:40:55.680
All the songs I've sung tonight
were really written

01:40:55.682 --> 01:40:58.684
and performed by four men
called John Lennon,

01:40:58.686 --> 01:41:02.554
Paul McCartney, George Harrison
and Ringo Starr.

01:41:02.556 --> 01:41:05.357
The Beatles.

01:41:05.359 --> 01:41:07.326
They were the real geniuses.

01:41:07.328 --> 01:41:08.527
Me, I'm just a, sort of,

01:41:08.529 --> 01:41:11.329
go-between to, well,

01:41:11.331 --> 01:41:14.533
get their astonishing stuff
into the world.

01:41:14.535 --> 01:41:17.702
- Beatles?
- And, uh, I-I-I passed their amazing work off

01:41:17.704 --> 01:41:20.905
as my own so I could look like
I was amazing, too.

01:41:22.875 --> 01:41:25.610
I want you all to know that
I'm not gonna take any money

01:41:25.612 --> 01:41:27.878
for this work that isn't mine.

01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:31.315
So, you can have
all the songs for free.

01:41:31.317 --> 01:41:33.685
Rocky, do it.

01:41:33.687 --> 01:41:35.354
Right. Here goes.

01:41:35.356 --> 01:41:38.256
They're being released,
for free, online now.

01:41:38.258 --> 01:41:42.728
And I'd love to not
take any more praise for it.

01:41:42.730 --> 01:41:45.564
So, um...

01:41:45.566 --> 01:41:47.435
I'm so sorry.

01:41:50.536 --> 01:41:53.639
And while I'm at it, there's
one other thing to say as well,

01:41:53.641 --> 01:41:59.310
because... I've been a fool
twice over.

01:41:59.312 --> 01:42:02.848
And I want to thank Ellie...

01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:05.553
- for her love.
- Aw!

01:42:15.663 --> 01:42:17.298
And, Ellie...

01:42:20.334 --> 01:42:21.970
Elle...

01:42:24.871 --> 01:42:28.573
- I love you.
- Aw!

01:42:28.575 --> 01:42:30.908
- Aw.
- Oh.

01:42:30.910 --> 01:42:32.913
I always have.

01:42:34.981 --> 01:42:37.618
Always.

01:42:44.424 --> 01:42:46.457
That's definitely enough
talking for one night.

01:42:47.628 --> 01:42:49.927
But it's been a blast.

01:42:49.929 --> 01:42:52.430
We love you, Jack!

01:42:52.432 --> 01:42:54.866
We still love you!

01:43:09.048 --> 01:43:11.416
Where's the stage?

01:43:11.418 --> 01:43:12.551
What floor is this?

01:43:12.553 --> 01:43:15.490
Where is the goddamn stage?!

01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:25.997
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

01:43:25.999 --> 01:43:28.667
That's a lot of information to take in.

01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:29.971
I know.

01:43:31.172 --> 01:43:31.804
Well, if you'd told me I was
gonna be on the big screen,

01:43:31.806 --> 01:43:33.441
I'd have got my hair done.

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:36.675
I'm sorry.

01:43:36.677 --> 01:43:38.643
You didn't write
any of the songs?

01:43:38.645 --> 01:43:40.412
No.

01:43:40.414 --> 01:43:43.614
That is very bad behavior.

01:43:43.616 --> 01:43:45.082
- On a global scale.
- Yeah.

01:43:45.084 --> 01:43:46.788
It's very bad.

01:43:54.727 --> 01:43:56.697
Well, this is a strange one.

01:44:01.067 --> 01:44:04.403
Of course I've always known
I was number two.

01:44:04.405 --> 01:44:06.771
But that's not
a bad place to be.

01:44:06.773 --> 01:44:10.675
Some of the best songs
never made it to number one.

01:44:10.677 --> 01:44:13.010
"Common People" by Pulp,
for a start.

01:44:13.012 --> 01:44:14.779
It's a total classic.

01:44:14.781 --> 01:44:17.752
And obviously all I want
is for Ellie to be happy.

01:44:21.621 --> 01:44:23.889
Gavin.

01:44:23.891 --> 01:44:26.460
Best man I ever met.

01:44:30.196 --> 01:44:31.695
- Thank you, Gavin.
- He's here.

01:44:31.697 --> 01:44:33.064
- He's here! - Go on.
- What is that?

01:44:33.066 --> 01:44:35.065
- Oh, God. - GAVIN: Go!
- Jack! - Jack!

01:44:35.067 --> 01:44:36.467
- Oh, my... We should definitely go!
- Yeah, yeah.

01:44:36.469 --> 01:44:38.068
Shit!

01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:40.104
Where's that lying
son of a bitch?

01:44:40.106 --> 01:44:41.139
Move, idiots!

01:44:41.141 --> 01:44:43.707
Look, he's here!

01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:45.042
Jack!

01:44:45.044 --> 01:44:46.610
Jack, please take me with you.

01:44:46.612 --> 01:44:48.046
No one else will employ me.

01:44:48.048 --> 01:44:49.079
I-I'm rubbish at my job.

01:44:49.081 --> 01:44:50.148
Just hold them off, Rocky.

01:44:50.150 --> 01:44:52.050
In the name of money, stop!

01:44:52.052 --> 01:44:54.752
Get back here, you stupid,
English mother...

01:44:54.754 --> 01:44:57.087

Debra, stop this.
