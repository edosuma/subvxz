(mellow music playing)

01:16.166 --> 01:20.567
-Oh, Ma, did you eat all this candy?
-I was looking for the prize.

01:21.967 --> 01:24.300
Prizes are in cracker jacks.

01:24.367 --> 01:26.633
Boy, you forget something new every day.

01:27.767 --> 01:30.400
These are for me.
They're from Stanley.

01:31.100 --> 01:35.233
"Roses are red, violets are blue.
I hope you enjoy this candy.

01:35.300 --> 01:37.033
It cost me 42."

01:38.934 --> 01:43.233
I'm guessing here,
but I'll bet you Stan wrote this himself.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.734
But it's sweet.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.367
Yeah, real sweet.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.333
What's that supposed to mean?

01:48.400 --> 01:53.533
Ever since he made a fortune, he's been
coming on to you like gangbusters.

01:53.600 --> 01:54.734
I don't like it.

01:55.467 --> 01:58.000
Not that I've ever actually
seen gangbusters.

01:58.567 --> 02:01.367
But I did see <i>Ghostbusters.</i>
I didn't like that either.

02:02.500 --> 02:05.500
They couldn't give the black guy
one funny line?

02:06.533 --> 02:08.300
And how about that sequel?

02:10.500 --> 02:12.934
What the hell were we just talking about?

02:13.567 --> 02:16.533
Look, Ma, Stan and I have
a long history together.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.567
It's nice that we can finally talk
as friends.

02:20.633 --> 02:23.100
Friends are one thing,
but he's your ex-husband,

02:23.166 --> 02:25.667
and you're giving him the wrong idea.

02:25.934 --> 02:30.467
You and I can argue about this
till the cows come home.

02:30.533 --> 02:32.133
We're home.

02:36.200 --> 02:37.867
Oh, what a day!

02:38.133 --> 02:42.400
I wasn't able to get any work done
because of that new girl, Abby.

02:42.467 --> 02:47.700
She's constantly talking to me,
and she never listens to me.

02:47.767 --> 02:50.433
Do you know what it's like to be ignored?

02:50.734 --> 02:52.266
So how was your day, Rose?

02:55.066 --> 03:00.066
She's a sweet girl looking for a friend.
And we do have a common bond.

03:00.133 --> 03:03.600
She used to be a newscaster.
Now she's an assistant like me.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.367
So there's this cognitive dissonance
between her actual and ideal self

03:08.433 --> 03:11.367
which causes her to be practically
dysfunctional.

03:13.033 --> 03:16.467
-Of course, I'm no psychologist.
-No, you're a nitwit.

03:18.300 --> 03:22.300
-How come you know those words?
-It's not nice calling her a nitwit,

03:22.367 --> 03:24.300
but since the cat's out of the bag...

03:25.433 --> 03:27.700
how do you know those words?

03:27.767 --> 03:31.367
From reading the <i>American Journal</i>
<i>of Abnormal Psychology.</i>

03:32.133 --> 03:34.567
It's published in St. Olaf, you know.

03:35.567 --> 03:38.767
My uncle Günter used
to be the editor.

03:38.834 --> 03:40.667
What were you, the centerfold?

03:41.667 --> 03:45.867
I refuse to believe
you've ever read a scientific journal.

03:45.934 --> 03:50.000
Believe what you want. See if I care.
Hypersexual bitch.

03:54.367 --> 04:00.800
(calm music playing)

04:01.300 --> 04:02.900
Oh, there you are, Rose. Good.

04:02.967 --> 04:06.767
Honey, I'm borrowing your earrings
to go with this new outfit of mine.

04:06.834 --> 04:09.467
-Tell me I look stunning.
-You look stunning.

04:09.533 --> 04:12.200
-You're not just saying that?
-No, I'm just repeating it.

04:15.166 --> 04:18.500
-Blanche, I need to talk to you.
-Oh, okay.

04:18.567 --> 04:20.300
It's about a friend of mine.

04:20.367 --> 04:23.767
I think she's taking advantage of me
and I don't know how to tell her.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.166
I mean, it's as if she
doesn't care about my needs

04:26.233 --> 04:28.467
just because she's a lot younger
than I am.

04:28.533 --> 04:30.700
Fine, keep your damned earrings.

04:33.233 --> 04:38.033
-Oh, no. No, Blanche, not you. Abby.
-Oh, right.

04:38.100 --> 04:41.266
I was thrown by the "She's a lot
younger than you" part.

04:42.767 --> 04:45.300
-So what should I do?
-Say something to her.

04:45.367 --> 04:48.333
Tell her you have to get something off
your chest, and put your foot down.

04:48.400 --> 04:53.333
-That girl thinks only of herself.
-You're right. Put my foot down.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.467
Get it off my chest.

04:55.834 --> 04:57.500
Hi, Rose. Where you going?

04:57.567 --> 04:59.834
Dorothy, I'm going to get
something off my foot.

05:02.066 --> 05:04.367
Good for you, Rose.
Careful of the carpet.

05:09.133 --> 05:12.467
Blanche, I need to talk to you privately.

05:13.066 --> 05:14.266
Oh, okay.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.133
There's this person...

05:17.633 --> 05:19.700
someone I've known quite a while.

05:20.033 --> 05:22.667
And lately there seems to be this...

05:23.200 --> 05:25.367
attraction developing...

05:25.800 --> 05:29.467
an attraction I've been trying to deny.
Blanche, what are you doing?

05:34.700 --> 05:35.967
It's a curse.

05:38.233 --> 05:40.567
My beauty's always been a curse.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.100
I'm sorry, Dorothy,

05:43.166 --> 05:48.066
but like the fatal blossom
of the graceful Jimsonweed,

05:48.133 --> 05:52.166
I entice with my fragrance
but can provide no succor.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.934
I'm talking about Stanley, you idiot!

05:59.800 --> 06:02.767
Get out of here.
Stan has the hots for me?

06:03.934 --> 06:07.667
For me, not you, fatal blossom. For me.

06:09.834 --> 06:12.867
We went for a walk, and he told me.

06:12.934 --> 06:15.367
-Dorothy, this came for you.
-Oh?

06:15.767 --> 06:17.367
Oh, it's from Stan.

06:19.333 --> 06:21.200
It's steaks.

06:22.967 --> 06:24.967
He sent me steaks.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.633
-So he still has the wrong idea.
-Ma, it's nothing.

06:29.700 --> 06:32.600
Dorothy, the man sent you meat.

06:34.367 --> 06:35.867
Oh, I don't know.

06:35.934 --> 06:40.767
I really do want Stan as a friend.
But just as a friend.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.266
So what was that lip-lock
the other night?

06:43.734 --> 06:45.433
What's this?

06:45.500 --> 06:47.900
I gave him a little kiss.

06:47.967 --> 06:51.300
That was no little kiss.
That was more like a dental checkup.

06:54.433 --> 06:56.867
Your whole head was practically
in his mouth.

06:58.200 --> 07:01.500
-All right, Ma, all right.
-A little kiss, she says.

07:01.567 --> 07:03.367
The man almost digested her.

07:05.266 --> 07:07.266
It was like watching a <i>Nova</i> special.

07:08.333 --> 07:12.533
When Stan comes over tonight,
I'll talk to him.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.233
I'll apologize to him for leading him on.
I only hope I don't hurt his feelings.

07:17.300 --> 07:20.400
Well, there are worse things
than hurt feelings.

07:20.467 --> 07:21.867
That's true, pussycat.

07:22.166 --> 07:25.700
As we say in Sicily,
"Sticks and stones can break your bones,

07:25.767 --> 07:27.800
but cement pays homage to tradition."

07:30.166 --> 07:35.100
(serene music playing)

07:35.967 --> 07:38.867
It would be a good idea if we rehearsed

07:38.934 --> 07:40.567
how you're going to break up
with Stan tonight.

07:40.633 --> 07:42.767
Okay, I'll be Stan.

07:42.834 --> 07:47.033
-I didn't know you're dating Stan.
-I'm not. And I don't need to rehearse.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.600
It's a good idea.
If you'd like, I'll be Stan.

07:50.667 --> 07:53.333
I already got dibs on Stan.
You be Dorothy.

07:54.700 --> 07:58.367
Don't be stupid.
Rose ought to be Dorothy.

07:58.433 --> 07:59.700
No, thanks.

08:03.100 --> 08:04.533
But I'll play Stan.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.367
Well, I'm not playing Dorothy.

08:07.433 --> 08:10.367
Although playing a sap on stilts
would be a cakewalk.

08:11.233 --> 08:15.600
-No offense, pussycat.
-None taken, you cankerous little prune.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.467
(doorbell rings)

08:22.633 --> 08:24.834
It's me, Stan. Am I late?

08:24.900 --> 08:26.800
Not if you're willing to play Dorothy.

08:30.133 --> 08:32.133
Come on in. You're fine.

08:32.200 --> 08:35.667
Babe, you'll never guess what
I bought today.

08:35.734 --> 08:40.533
It's got white walls, original upholstery,
and we took it to our senior prom.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.567
Stan, that's impossible.

08:42.633 --> 08:44.934
No, Dorothy.
Don't give up. We'll get this.

08:47.066 --> 08:49.500
It's in the driveway right now.

08:49.567 --> 08:51.467
1948, bullet-nosed,

08:51.533 --> 08:54.266
and it says "Studebaker"
right across the back.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.333
Okay, okay, no more hints.

08:58.333 --> 09:00.900
Rose, head down, it's quiet time.

09:02.033 --> 09:04.433
Stanley, what possessed you?

09:04.500 --> 09:07.567
I love that car. All the memories we had.

09:07.633 --> 09:10.233
The cruising, the drive-ins,
the road trips.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.700
Don't forget the accident you
had in that car.

09:13.700 --> 09:14.967
What accident?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.400
Here's a hint,
it cost me $10 every Christmas

09:17.467 --> 09:18.967
and still calls me grandma.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.867
Well, let's see...
is it something that floats?

09:29.600 --> 09:31.300
Come on, let's go for a spin.

09:31.367 --> 09:34.300
Stan, there's something
I need to say first.

09:34.367 --> 09:38.900
-We can talk in the car.
-I'll meet you outside.

09:39.233 --> 09:42.333
I'm not crazy about you going out
with him.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.667
Ma, we're just going to talk.

09:44.734 --> 09:47.667
I'm going to explain
that I'm not attracted to him.

09:47.734 --> 09:51.567
This is just a friendship,
but nothing more.

09:51.633 --> 09:54.367
I wish I could believe you. Be careful.

09:54.433 --> 09:57.133
Remember what they taught
you in parochial school,

09:57.200 --> 10:00.133
both feet on the ground,
no patent leather shoes,

10:00.200 --> 10:02.233
and macaroni and cheese
every Wednesday.

10:04.867 --> 10:05.900
Thank you, Ma.

10:05.967 --> 10:07.400
She's lost it.

10:10.667 --> 10:15.700
(mellow music playing)

10:30.600 --> 10:33.600
My God, what are you
kids doing in there?

10:39.300 --> 10:41.734
It's all right, officer. We're divorced.

10:43.967 --> 10:50.433
(serene music playing)

10:54.133 --> 10:59.200
-Are you still on the phone with Abby?
-Blanche, I can't get Abby off the phone.

10:59.266 --> 11:01.333
-Tell her a St. Olaf story.
-What'll that do?

11:01.400 --> 11:02.600
Give it a shot.

11:03.967 --> 11:07.233
You know, Abby, something like
that happened to me in St. Olaf.

11:08.266 --> 11:09.767
Well, sure, I understand.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.967
Yeah, this is a good time to replace
the batteries in your smoke alarm.

11:15.567 --> 11:17.200
That's odd, she hung up.

11:20.633 --> 11:24.300
Oh, Sophia, you're up.
Were we making too much noise?

11:24.367 --> 11:26.300
No, I was feeling frisky.

11:26.367 --> 11:29.467
Let's get the Ouija board
and scare up our husbands.

11:32.033 --> 11:34.967
Rose is still having trouble
with that friend.

11:35.033 --> 11:37.500
I can't tell her to leave me alone.

11:37.567 --> 11:38.967
Maybe someone else can...

11:39.367 --> 11:41.667
someone who's more candid
about their feelings.

11:41.734 --> 11:44.900
-Well, like who, Sophia?
-Give it some thought, slut puppy.

11:47.767 --> 11:51.567
You know, Sophia,
actually, you're pretty straightforward.

11:51.633 --> 11:52.633
It's a gift.

11:52.900 --> 11:57.433
-So tomorrow we'll take care of it.
-Oh, thank you, Sophia.

11:57.500 --> 12:00.433
-You're welcome, pussycat.
-I'm not Dorothy.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.500
From now on,
I'm calling everybody pussycat.

12:02.567 --> 12:04.533
It's cheaper than buying new glasses.

12:09.467 --> 12:10.934
Psst.
Is she gone?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.900
Are you just getting in?

12:13.467 --> 12:15.767
Have you been with Stan all this time?

12:15.834 --> 12:20.867
-The car ran out of gas.
-Oh, I've used that a thousand times.

12:20.934 --> 12:24.000
Did you do what I think you did?

12:24.066 --> 12:26.367
I don't know what you're... yes.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.333
-I can't believe this.
-How could you sleep with him?

12:32.400 --> 12:33.934
She slept with him?

12:36.100 --> 12:37.567
What did you think she did?

12:37.633 --> 12:40.166
She looks like she was pushing his car.

12:47.834 --> 12:51.800
Oh, I don't know.
He's just been so sweet lately.

12:51.867 --> 12:56.834
And we were at the beach
in the same car we used to make out in.

12:57.400 --> 13:01.066
-It just got to me. It was exciting.
-Damn it, Dorothy!

13:01.133 --> 13:04.200
If you'd have sex in public more often,
this wouldn't happen.

13:06.233 --> 13:08.734
I'm mad enough as it is.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.600
I mean, Stanley Zbornak
made me weak in the knees.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.266
You think I'm proud of that?

13:13.333 --> 13:15.934
-Who made the first move?
-I guess I did.

13:17.133 --> 13:20.066
It was dark, and Stan stopped the car.

13:20.600 --> 13:24.300
I swear I thought I was
setting the parking brake.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.467
Well, that's good. Safety first.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.100
To make matters worse,
the sex was incredible.

13:44.633 --> 13:46.633
It felt real and familiar.

13:46.700 --> 13:50.567
Made me feel like I've been kissing
strangers for the past seven years.

13:51.100 --> 13:54.300
And suddenly tonight
I was with a familiar,

13:54.367 --> 13:58.633
and I must say, surprisingly
agile old friend.

13:59.500 --> 14:03.367
-What are you going to do?
-You have a problem.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.200
How do you break off a relationship
when the sex is great?

14:07.266 --> 14:09.834
When the sex is lousy, it's easy.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.633
Two more dates and it's over.

14:14.900 --> 14:16.800
You know, just to make sure.

14:20.233 --> 14:23.133
I remember the best sex of my whole life.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.000
Was it difficult to get
out of the relationship?

14:26.066 --> 14:27.567
Not really.

14:27.934 --> 14:30.100
Poor Charlie died in the middle of it.

14:33.834 --> 14:36.533
Was that the best sex you
ever had with him?

14:36.600 --> 14:40.200
Yeah. There was something wild
about him that night...

14:40.667 --> 14:42.200
although I did think it was strange

14:42.266 --> 14:45.800
when he started yelling
"Rose, I'm going. I'm going!"

14:58.667 --> 15:00.900
Talk about your mixed emotions.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.467
-What was the best sex you had, Blanche?
-Way to go, Rose.

15:08.734 --> 15:11.967
Blanche, it's late.
There's only one cheesecake left,

15:12.033 --> 15:14.800
so let's make menopause
the cut-off point.

15:15.934 --> 15:20.333
Best sex... oh, it's just so hard to rate
these things.

15:20.800 --> 15:24.967
There's degree of difficulty,
style points, choice of music...

15:25.900 --> 15:28.533
did they land on their feet
during the dismount?

15:35.667 --> 15:37.834
Different people have different strengths,

15:37.900 --> 15:42.533
it's just impossible to tell,
but anything over a nine is excellent.

15:42.600 --> 15:47.200
-Over a nine?
-Points, Rose. Points.

15:54.266 --> 15:59.367
-Sophia, did we wake you again?
-No. I'm feeling frisky.

15:59.433 --> 16:03.233
-Let's get the Ouija board...
-Sophia, you already said that.

16:03.300 --> 16:06.867
It's the middle of the night.
You want fresh, turn on <i>Letterman.</i>

16:10.133 --> 16:13.166
We were telling "best sex ever" stories,
Sophia.

16:13.233 --> 16:16.567
But now we're tired of them,
so let's go to bed.

16:16.633 --> 16:18.900
No, wait. It's a good thing I'm up,

16:18.967 --> 16:25.633
because I have a story for you...
the sex story to end all sex stories.

16:26.400 --> 16:29.100
Sicily, 1922.

16:29.867 --> 16:31.800
I stop by a little trattoria...

16:32.667 --> 16:33.700
no, wait.

16:34.567 --> 16:37.000
I'm thinking of the best meal I ever had.

16:39.900 --> 16:42.700
-(telephone rings)
-I'll get it.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.700
Hello.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.467
Oh, yes. Well, hello.

16:49.100 --> 16:53.000
Um, no, I'm sorry.
I can't discuss that right now.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.500
Yes, I enjoyed it a great deal myself.

16:58.200 --> 16:59.333
Really?

17:02.867 --> 17:06.400
Yes. Okay, the earth did move.

17:08.100 --> 17:10.033
Big quake in California.

17:12.233 --> 17:13.967
Yeah, we'll speak soon.

17:14.934 --> 17:18.834
I look forward to that myself.
Yeah. Bye-bye.

17:30.633 --> 17:34.667
-Well, good night.
-Wait a minute.

17:35.200 --> 17:40.467
-Why were we telling sex stories?
-Gee, I don't know how it started.

17:40.533 --> 17:41.934
Sure, you do.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Remember, you thought
you were grabbing Stan's parking brake.

17:47.533 --> 17:48.900
Thanks, Rose.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.467
Well, good night.

17:53.934 --> 17:56.400
That was Stan, wasn't it?
Something happened.

17:56.467 --> 17:58.200
Yes, I admit it.

17:58.266 --> 18:01.467
I slept with Stan,
and I should be ashamed.

18:01.533 --> 18:04.600
Are you this desperate, this pathetic?

18:05.100 --> 18:08.700
-Have you lost all your pride?
-No, but keep it up. We're getting there.

18:09.767 --> 18:11.300
This is unforgivable.

18:11.367 --> 18:16.767
Ma, I admit I made a mistake with Stan,
but I will deal with it.

18:16.834 --> 18:21.834
It was wrong, I know that.
But now it's over.

18:21.900 --> 18:25.433
It better be, because I won't allow it
while you're in my house.

18:26.300 --> 18:28.967
-Sophia, this is my house.
-It is?

18:30.633 --> 18:31.767
Oh, right.

18:32.700 --> 18:36.266
Then let me give you
two words of advice... enough wicker.

18:38.734 --> 18:44.867
(calm music playing)

18:50.100 --> 18:53.000
Sophia, I really appreciate you
coming down here,

18:53.066 --> 18:57.033
-but maybe I should try once more.
-You're wasting your time.

18:57.100 --> 18:59.200
No, just let me try.

18:59.266 --> 19:02.867
If you sense I'm starting to pull back,
squeeze my arm.

19:02.934 --> 19:04.200
Gotcha.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.734
-Hi, Abby.
-I've got to talk to you.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.667
Me, too. Please listen-- what?

19:11.734 --> 19:14.967
I can't get over how flabby this is.

19:17.133 --> 19:21.433
Anyway, the station manager called me,
and there's this rumor you're not--

19:21.500 --> 19:23.100
Excuse me, Abby.

19:23.533 --> 19:25.834
I'd like to inject some candor here.

19:25.900 --> 19:29.467
I'd also like to inject a tranquilizer
dart into your backside.

19:30.734 --> 19:35.133
But my dart gun was confiscated after
the incident with the trick or treaters.

19:36.233 --> 19:40.533
In my defense, it was dark and I was
unaware of this <i>Ninja Turtle</i> craze.

19:41.066 --> 19:42.333
But I digress.

19:42.734 --> 19:45.667
So, to be brief, Abby,
shut up. Get a life.

19:45.734 --> 19:50.266
Stop calling Rose. Leave her alone.
Thank you.

19:53.266 --> 19:59.600
-Is that what you wanted to say?
-Well, I'm sorry, but I suppose so.

20:00.467 --> 20:04.767
Can I get your attention?
I'd like to clear the air.

20:04.834 --> 20:08.000
Wasn't me. I haven't had a raw vegetable
in six months.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.400
That's Mr. Percy,
our station manager.

20:13.467 --> 20:15.166
The secret's out.

20:15.233 --> 20:20.533
Our consumer reporter, Enrique Mas, has
announced he is leaving for the network.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.233
But we feel we've found the
perfect replacement.

20:23.300 --> 20:25.834
She's dramatic... she's experienced...

20:25.900 --> 20:28.333
please welcome our new
consumer reporter...

20:28.400 --> 20:29.667
Abby Wolfe.

20:32.633 --> 20:35.200
New consumer reporter.
Doesn't that mean...

20:35.266 --> 20:37.533
She's also my new boss.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.367
Boy, have you got some
serious butt to kiss.

20:42.166 --> 20:46.300
(calm music playing)

20:47.166 --> 20:49.300
-What's so funny?
<i>-Marmaduke.</i>

20:49.367 --> 20:51.367
Look at how he drives that car.

20:52.600 --> 20:58.333
I love my comics.
Every day, <i>Marmaduke </i>and <i>Apartment 3-G.</i>

20:58.400 --> 21:02.667
I haven't read <i>Apartment 3-G</i>
since 1961.

21:02.734 --> 21:06.200
Well, let me catch you up.
It is later the same day...

21:08.400 --> 21:10.834
(telephone rings)

21:11.467 --> 21:12.700
Hello.

21:13.066 --> 21:14.467
Oh, hi, Abby.

21:15.133 --> 21:17.467
I guess I owe you a little apology.

21:18.533 --> 21:19.800
You do?

21:20.800 --> 21:23.300
Well, yeah, I'll be right over.

21:24.500 --> 21:28.433
Abby wants me to help her
get over her first day jitters.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.166
You're thinking she's too dependent on me.

21:31.233 --> 21:34.700
But it's better to be flattered
than angry,

21:34.767 --> 21:37.166
and it's nice that she needs me.

21:37.533 --> 21:40.734
Besides, I have other friends
who pay attention to me.

21:41.333 --> 21:44.333
Special friends. Friends like you.

21:49.467 --> 21:50.867
Where's she going?

21:53.300 --> 21:54.934
I don't think she said.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.166
Where's who going?

22:00.700 --> 22:03.200
Well, I guess I'll go read in bed.

22:03.266 --> 22:05.734
No date with the missing link tonight?

22:07.300 --> 22:09.900
I told you I'm not seeing Stan anymore.

22:10.333 --> 22:13.934
I remember the tears that man caused me,
the hatred I felt.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.767
I don't need that grief.

22:16.367 --> 22:21.600
Good. Because I worry about
my little girl, no matter how big you get.

22:21.667 --> 22:22.900
Thanks, Ma.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.467
By the way,
how big are you going to get?

22:31.567 --> 22:32.800
Good night, Ma.

22:34.133 --> 22:38.767
(serene music playing)

22:41.533 --> 22:44.467
-Finally. Where have you been?
-I got away as soon as I could.

22:44.834 --> 22:48.300
-You have the Studebaker?
-Almost out of gas and ready to go.

22:48.734 --> 22:53.533
-If my mother found out, she'd kill me.
-I get the feeling you're ashamed of me.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.200
Don't be silly-- get down!

23:00.333 --> 23:04.333
Stan, can't you wait
till we get to the car?

23:05.600 --> 23:09.433
(helicopter motor)

23:13.066 --> 23:17.133
(man) My God, what are you
kids doing down there?

23:24.133 --> 23:29.734
(theme music playing)
