JULES: Tommy.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.720
Tommy, breakfast is ready!

00:42.800 --> 00:44.080
Okay, Mom.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.240
You gotta hustle, tiger.
You don't want to miss your plane.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.480
-What are you doing?
-It's a whistle I made for Michael.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.520
He really liked the last one
I made him at the reunion.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.840
He said it was cool.

00:55.920 --> 00:58.600
(CLICKS TONGUE) That's sweet, honey.
I know how hard you worked on it.

01:02.920 --> 01:04.760
I was thinking. Maybe I shouldn't go.

01:04.880 --> 01:06.000
Ah, would you stop it already?

01:06.080 --> 01:08.240
You're just like your father.
I'll be fine.

01:08.320 --> 01:10.240
But there's so much to do.
And what about the money?

01:10.320 --> 01:13.120
You are too young
to be worrying about things like this.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.800
But you said we were partners, remember?

01:14.880 --> 01:16.000
You never let me forget it.

01:16.080 --> 01:18.920
But I think I can manage
for four days without you.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.160
It'll be tough, I know, but I can do it.
Promise.

01:23.080 --> 01:29.000
(CLICK TONGUE) Tommy, it'll be fine.
So, please stop your worrying.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.520
Mom, what's it like in Beverly Hills?

01:36.640 --> 01:39.440
JULES: Well, it's a little
different than here.

01:40.160 --> 01:43.640

(JUICER WHIRRING)

02:16.520 --> 02:17.880
Good morning, Arlie.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.680
Good afternoon, Mr. Michael.

02:22.080 --> 02:24.360
How can you drink this stuff?

02:24.440 --> 02:26.520
Let me make you
some waffles and eggs, huh?

02:26.600 --> 02:29.560
Put some meat on your bones.
You're so skinny.

02:29.640 --> 02:32.600
Nine percent body fat is not skinny.
It's lean.

02:32.680 --> 02:36.080
-It's a stick.
-(CHUCKLES)

02:36.160 --> 02:38.040
-Morning, Mom.
-Hi, sweetie.

02:38.120 --> 02:41.360
Don't forget you have to pick up Tommy
this afternoon, 4:30.

02:41.440 --> 02:43.360
That's... That's today?

02:43.440 --> 02:44.560
-Mmm-hmm.
-Uh...

02:44.640 --> 02:48.080
I can't. I have a date with, uh, Gina.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.440
-Gina?
-Yeah. Gina.

02:51.640 --> 02:53.840
Like, my new girlfriend, Gina.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.000
Her dad's the big movie director.

02:56.080 --> 02:59.920
<i>Lethal Force. Tornado. Tornado II.</i>

03:00.000 --> 03:01.120
I can't keep up with you.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.880
And, honey, I've got
a million things to do

03:02.960 --> 03:04.720
for this fundraiser in Palm Springs.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.200
The way it's going, I'm hoping
for a miracle that it comes together.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.840
Where is that guest list?

03:09.920 --> 03:11.760
By the phone, Mrs. Woods.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.280
Thank you, Arlene. That's right.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.040
Mom, look. I just don't think
that it's gonna work out.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.880
No buts. You told me
"no problemo," remember?

03:18.960 --> 03:20.800
You were excited to invite him here.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.600
Well, you know,
it's not that I'm not excited.

03:22.720 --> 03:25.760
It's just that, you know, with Gina now,
my schedule's a little packed.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.640
So unpack it a little.

03:27.720 --> 03:29.800
-He's your cousin.
-Mom, come on.

03:29.880 --> 03:31.840
Honey. (SIGHS)

03:33.120 --> 03:35.200
He's coming here to see you.

03:35.280 --> 03:38.680
And you know the hard time he's had
after losing his father. Hmm?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.480
It's only for a few days,

03:41.560 --> 03:44.040
and I'm sure Gina will understand.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.720
-Hey, buddy!
-Hey, Dad.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.280
-Home for lunch, huh?
-Yeah, in between classes.

03:49.360 --> 03:52.080
Mmm! Yesterday's and today's?

03:52.160 --> 03:53.600
PROFESSOR BAYNES: <i>Okay, class.</i>

03:53.720 --> 03:55.480
Drew will pass back your exams.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.400
You know they count for 20% of your grade.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.640
So, my dad's wrapping his film soon.

04:01.760 --> 04:04.960
Says he has to meet
this Michael I keep talking about.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.480
-Oh, well... (CHUCKLES)
-(CHUCKLES)

04:07.440 --> 04:09.120
Did you find out when you're
gonna go to the Riviera yet?

04:09.360 --> 04:11.640
Oh, it depends when
Daddy starts his next movie.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.760
But he said he'd call
as soon as he finds out.

04:13.840 --> 04:14.880
Oh, I hope you go

04:14.960 --> 04:16.000
-the same time that I do.
-Mmm.

04:16.080 --> 04:17.760
Can you imagine?
I mean, you and me in Europe?

04:17.840 --> 04:19.400
The damage that we could do?

04:19.480 --> 04:22.080
I think some of you thought
you were already on summer break

04:22.160 --> 04:23.520
when you should have been
paying more attention

04:23.600 --> 04:25.680
to land trusts,
property deeds and mergers.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.800
BOTH: Mmm.

04:33.720 --> 04:34.960
I got a "D."

04:35.080 --> 04:36.600
Oh.

04:36.680 --> 04:39.680
You don't suppose that stands
for "delightful reading," do you?

04:40.160 --> 04:42.280
-No.
-I didn't think so.

04:44.520 --> 04:47.120
-Here.
-What is that?

04:47.200 --> 04:48.360
Well, it's not officially

04:48.440 --> 04:49.680
-our two-week anniversary...
-Oh.

04:49.760 --> 04:52.920
...that's tomorrow,
but I can't stand it. I love presents.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.960
-What did you get me?
-Well, open it.

04:56.640 --> 04:57.920
-Okay. All right.
-(CHUCKLES)

04:58.840 --> 05:01.680
I don't believe it. I don't believe this!

05:02.160 --> 05:03.760
Try it on. Try it on.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.640
Okay. All right. All right.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.680
Oh, man!

05:07.760 --> 05:10.000
Here. Ah.

05:12.160 --> 05:14.800
Wow, I love it!

05:14.880 --> 05:16.480
Please don't tell me that
that's the right time.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.760
It better be.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.240
-I gotta go.
-Go? What's up?

05:21.360 --> 05:23.920
I was supposed to be at the airport
30 minutes ago to pick up my cousin.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.840
Listen, I love the watch.
I'll call you later. Bye.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.080
Bye.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.600
-MICHAEL: Hey, cowboy!
-Hi, Michael.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.960
Sorry I'm late, man.
LA traffic's a nightmare.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.200
It's okay.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.000
Are you ready to have some fun?

05:44.080 --> 05:45.400
-Yeah.
-All right.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.680
Hop on in.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.400
OFFICER: You! Move it now, let's go!

05:53.600 --> 05:55.040
Let's rock and roll, buddy.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.320
I'm so glad you're finally here, Tommy.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.320
I cannot believe
how much you've grown up, man.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.520
-Michael, I want...
-(PHONE RINGS)

06:01.600 --> 06:02.720

06:04.720 --> 06:06.120
Hey, you.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.600
Listen, I'm sorry for having to
run out on you so quick earlier.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.360
I want you to say hi
to somebody for me, all right?

06:10.440 --> 06:11.520
Say hi to Tommy for me.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.920
<i>-Hi, Tommy.</i>
-Hi.

06:17.680 --> 06:20.400

06:22.320 --> 06:23.760
-No way.
<i>-Way.</i>

06:23.920 --> 06:26.080
<i>I'm going to arrange it</i>
<i>so we can fly over together.</i>

06:26.640 --> 06:29.040
Whoo! Look out, Saint-Tropez, baby.

(PHONE BEEPS)

06:30.640 --> 06:32.200
Hello. Gina.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.440
Gina? Argh!

06:34.520 --> 06:36.360
-I hate cell phones, man.
-(PHONE RINGS)

06:36.440 --> 06:38.440

-Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hello?

06:38.520 --> 06:40.040
-GINA: <i>Michael?</i>
-Yes.

06:40.120 --> 06:41.840
<i>Argh, I'm going through a canyon.</i>

06:41.960 --> 06:43.400
<i>So I was just going to ask you,</i>

06:43.480 --> 06:46.280
<i>how are you gonna get out</i>
<i>of the European Study Tour?</i>

06:46.360 --> 06:48.800
I'm gonna use it to get over there
and play like it's a drag.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.560
My folks will completely buy it.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.240
<i>What about the school credits?</i>

06:52.760 --> 06:54.400
You're all the credit that I need.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.280
(CHUCKLES) <i>You're so cute.</i>

06:56.640 --> 06:59.000
<i>So are we gonna do anything</i>
<i>for our anniversary?</i>

07:00.880 --> 07:02.600
Yes, yes, of course.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.400
<i>-Oh, Miss you.</i>
-I miss you.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.040
-Good-bye.
<i>-Bye.</i>

07:07.120 --> 07:08.160
Hey, Michael, I...

07:08.240 --> 07:10.080
Listen, you don't mind if we stop
at the jewelry store up here, do you?

07:10.160 --> 07:12.000
I gotta pick up
an anniversary gift, you know?

07:12.080 --> 07:13.960
-Oh, it's okay.
-All right, buddy.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.160
MICHAEL: I'm glad you're here, man.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.200
MICHAEL: Here we are. Home sweet home.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.000
TOMMY: This is bigger than my school.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.120
MICHAEL: Arlene's got you set up
in one of the guest rooms, buddy.

07:29.640 --> 07:32.760
It's too bad Jules couldn't
come out here with you, Tommy.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.240
I miss her.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.560
She wanted to,
but one of us needed to be there.

07:37.960 --> 07:41.240
And I hear Disneyland is at
the top of your list while you're here.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.320
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Yeah, I can't wait.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.920
Oh, that's all right, sweetie.
I'll get it.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.680
TOMMY: Thank you.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.640
-Michael, why don't you take him tomorrow?
-Saturday? No. No.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.200
Saturday would be way too crowded.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.360
We're gonna go, uh, Monday.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.480
Monday would be much better.
You know, the lines will be less.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.760
You can go on the rides
as many times as you want.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.120
That'll be good, right?

08:01.200 --> 08:02.760
-If you think so.
-Yeah.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.000
Hey, hey, hey! Tommy!

08:05.080 --> 08:06.360
-Hi, Uncle Glenn.
-Hey.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.800
How big have you gotten, huh?

08:08.920 --> 08:10.120
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey, Dad.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.360
Hi, honey. Sorry I'm late.

08:12.440 --> 08:14.520
-You ready?
-JACY: Bags are at the front door.

08:14.640 --> 08:17.360
Tommy, Michael has assured us
that you're gonna have a great time.

08:18.440 --> 08:19.960
-Glad you're here.
-(CHUCKLES)

08:20.560 --> 08:23.360
And I'm just so sorry
about the timing, Tommy.

08:23.520 --> 08:24.960
Glenn and I have to be in Palm Springs

08:25.040 --> 08:27.480
for this fundraiser
we committed to ages ago.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.120
Mom told me. It's okay.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.280
-Okay.
-MICHAEL: You guys have fun.

08:31.360 --> 08:32.520
-You too.
-Bye.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.880
So you must be fried
from flying, huh, buddy?

08:35.960 --> 08:37.200
Not really.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.000
Whoa, look at this room!

08:39.120 --> 08:40.440
It's cool, isn't it? And you know what?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.720
We have every movie
that you can possibly dream of.

08:42.800 --> 08:46.080
My dad knows a couple of guys
in the business. They hook us up.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.320
No way! Candy?

08:48.400 --> 08:50.880
-A popcorn machine?
-You bet, buddy.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.680
Hey. Check this out.

08:54.840 --> 08:55.880
Whoa.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.360
So what movie do you wanna watch?

08:57.440 --> 08:59.360
It doesn't matter.
Whatever you wanna watch.

08:59.440 --> 09:02.400
Well, actually, um,
I got to go over to Gina's

09:02.560 --> 09:04.120
and give her that necklace
that we got her.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.040
You know women, right?
They got to have their jewels.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.520
(CHUCKLES) It'll only take,
like, five minutes.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.680
Unless you don't want me to go,
and then... Then I won't.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.120
I'll just call her
and tell her that I can't.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.160
She'll be cool with that.
'Cause it's your first night here.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.320
It's okay.

09:18.560 --> 09:20.320
You know how to load a VCR?

09:21.400 --> 09:22.880
We have VCRs in Montana.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.560
I'll see you later, then.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.080
-There you go.
-Thanks, Arlene. That looks great.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.280
Oh, it's my pleasure, Tommy.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.320
You know, one of these mornings,
I'll make you breakfast.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.000
-Montana-style.
-I'd love that.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.280
Think Michael will be in soon?

09:44.360 --> 09:46.360
Hey, hey, hey. I heard my name.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.720
What's up, buddy? How'd you sleep?

09:49.920 --> 09:52.240
-Great. How about you?
-Great.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.240
Listen. I have to run out.
I gotta do a few things.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.000
Okay, I'll go with you.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.440
What, are you kidding?

09:57.520 --> 09:59.120

Let's just keep this between us, okay?

38:16.320 --> 38:17.600
Okay.

38:18.240 --> 38:21.840
(EXHALES) Well, I certainly feel
a little better.

38:22.160 --> 38:23.360
You should.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.680
You were washing up for more than an hour.

38:28.760 --> 38:31.560
What's going on?
What are you guys looking at?

38:32.440 --> 38:33.920

38:36.080 --> 38:37.280
What?

38:38.080 --> 38:39.440
Oh.

38:39.520 --> 38:41.000
-The sunset.
-Hmm.

38:41.840 --> 38:43.120
Yeah, it's nice.

38:45.600 --> 38:48.120
Well, I gotta hit the sack.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.960
I'm sure I'll be seeing you
bright and early, huh?

38:51.040 --> 38:54.040
Yep. Gonna watch some TV tonight?

38:54.640 --> 38:56.560
No. Not tonight, thanks.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.480
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night, honey.

39:12.720 --> 39:14.280
Sure is quiet.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.240
Little different than Los Angeles, huh?

39:18.200 --> 39:20.080
Yeah. Little bit.

39:26.320 --> 39:29.360
One of the squirrels renovating over there
or something?

39:29.440 --> 39:30.960
Oh, the tree house?

39:31.040 --> 39:35.760
No, that's a project that Tommy
and his dad started before he got sick.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.520
I'm sorry about Uncle John.

39:42.160 --> 39:44.320
Yeah. Me, too.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.360
This ranch was his life.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.920
It was our life.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.720
John and Tommy cut all that wood together
and stacked it there.

39:59.720 --> 40:02.640
Tommy does a little bit here and there,

40:03.840 --> 40:06.120
but he never seems to find time
to get it done.

-Well, pick this up.

40:34.320 --> 40:35.880
All right, fine. (GRUNTS)

40:35.960 --> 40:38.680
All right.
We're gonna see the cattle through

40:38.760 --> 40:40.720
and spend the night out.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.560
My neighbor says she saw some wolf tracks.

40:43.960 --> 40:46.240
-Wolves?
-Yeah, but it's no big deal.

40:47.160 --> 40:50.000
If we spot 'em,
we call the Forest Services and they'll...

40:50.080 --> 40:51.840
They'll catch them for relocation.

40:52.800 --> 40:54.200
Are you sure you can ride?

40:54.280 --> 40:56.320
Please. Don't you remember the reunion?

40:56.800 --> 40:58.480
Those were donkeys in the Grand Canyon.

40:58.600 --> 41:00.160
Uh, same difference.

She's mine.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.680
My dad and I found her
when she was less than a year old.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.520
She was almost dead.

41:12.600 --> 41:13.880
Come on. You found her?

41:14.240 --> 41:16.680
Seriously, we did.
There's a herd of wild horses

41:16.760 --> 41:19.600
that roam on our property
on the other side of the bluff.

41:19.680 --> 41:21.880
She had an injured leg
and couldn't keep up.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.480
Well, if she was wild,
why didn't you just let her go again?

41:24.560 --> 41:26.920
We tried. But she kept coming back.

41:27.440 --> 41:28.480
Hmm.

41:29.240 --> 41:31.360
So which one of these
lucky gals gets me, huh?

41:32.160 --> 41:33.800
I'm gonna put you on Slingshot.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.440
Which one's that?

41:37.720 --> 41:38.920
That?

41:39.000 --> 41:41.520
Oh, come on! She looks sick!

41:41.600 --> 41:44.960
She's got one foot in the glue factory.
I could go faster on a carousel.

41:45.040 --> 41:46.840
Hey. She's a good horse.
Not the fastest, but...

41:46.920 --> 41:50.240
No, no, no, no.
I am not riding that one. No.

41:51.280 --> 41:52.640
I want, uh...

41:53.680 --> 41:55.120
I want to ride that one.

41:56.560 --> 41:57.760
Sure, if that's the one you want.

41:57.840 --> 41:59.200
Yeah, what's her name?

42:00.280 --> 42:03.200
Sometimes, we just call him Black.

Okay. All right. All right. I got it.

42:17.360 --> 42:18.720
I saw <i>Young Guns.</i>

Now, he can be
a little temperamental to begin with.

You might want to get on
and I can lead you around

-Lead me around?

for Twister and Mule?

42:30.640 --> 42:32.200
No, I don't think so.

missing a great photo op here.

51:36.840 --> 51:38.840
explaining to her why I hung up on her.

51:39.680 --> 51:42.320
I cannot believe they stampeded
because of a little phone ringing.

51:42.400 --> 51:44.000
You know, it's your neighbor's
fault, though.

51:44.120 --> 51:45.320
He should've told us
that they found the wolf.

in the first place.

(GRUNTS)

52:29.720 --> 52:31.200
What are you doing?

52:32.880 --> 52:34.800
Tommy said to load the poles
into the truck,

52:34.920 --> 52:36.800
so I loaded the poles into the truck.

52:37.760 --> 52:40.320
-You got a problem with that?
-Nope.

52:40.400 --> 52:44.080
Just wondering why you're loading poles
into a truck that doesn't work.

52:44.480 --> 52:46.960
That old thing hasn't run
in about 15 years.

53:16.480 --> 53:17.760
You...

53:17.880 --> 53:22.360
You knew that I would load those poles
into the wrong truck.

53:23.480 --> 53:27.040
You didn't load them in the one that was
parked in front of the barn, did you?

53:27.120 --> 53:29.800
-That hasn't worked in years.
-So I've heard.

53:30.280 --> 53:32.160
You know, I am sick of you doing this.

53:32.240 --> 53:35.760
Doing what? I told you to get the keys
if you wanted to move it closer.

53:35.840 --> 53:38.800
Why would I mean that truck?
It was parked right next to the pile.

53:38.880 --> 53:42.240
Payback is over, little cousin.
We are even.

53:42.320 --> 53:45.320
No, as a matter of fact,
we are way past even.

You know what, you can go ahead
and call my dad, if you want.

53:47.440 --> 53:49.280
I don't really care.
I've had enough of this,

53:49.360 --> 53:50.880
and enough of you to last me a lifetime.

53:50.960 --> 53:52.960
So just stay out of my way, you got it?

53:55.280 --> 53:57.440
I can't believe I used to
wish you were my brother.

There's nothing about you
I like or respect.

54:01.080 --> 54:02.400
You've changed so much.

54:02.920 --> 54:05.920
Are you talking about being
all buddy-buddy at the reunion?

54:06.480 --> 54:07.880
'Cause think about it, Einstein.

54:07.960 --> 54:10.200
You and I were
the only two people there under 30.

54:10.280 --> 54:11.880
I was so bored I had nothing better to do

54:11.960 --> 54:14.200
than to hang out
with a snot-nosed seven-year-old like you.

54:14.280 --> 54:17.080
That's how bored I was.
Now leave me alone!

54:17.880 --> 54:19.120
I will.

54:19.200 --> 54:20.560
Just go ahead and serve your sentence

I'm, uh, waiting for you.

54:51.680 --> 54:54.120
Fixing a fence
ain't that hard to figure out, son.

54:54.200 --> 54:56.800
You replace the broken posts
with the new ones.

55:02.120 --> 55:03.360

55:04.680 --> 55:06.320

I wouldn't have believed it
if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.

Look, I didn't really ask
to be a part of all this cowboy stuff.

55:19.280 --> 55:21.360
I guess I'm just a city boy
who really doesn't fit in.

55:21.520 --> 55:24.520
No, you're not a city boy.
You just don't give a darn.

-You have no idea?
-No.

I know.

1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:17.680
You know?

1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:21.360
And you haven't done anything?

1:03:21.440 --> 1:03:23.280
<i>Michael, it's not that easy.</i>

1:03:23.400 --> 1:03:26.440
-I offered. They don't want my help.
-Why?

<i>come from their own hands.</i>

Michael, when your mother first told me
that they were in trouble,

1:03:36.520 --> 1:03:37.560
I called.

1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.360
<i>But how do you give something</i>
<i>to someone who won't take it?</i>

1:03:40.440 --> 1:03:42.800
That's so stupid.

1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:47.160
They'd rather lose the ranch
than take the money.

1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:50.520
<i>I even offered to make her a loan</i>
<i>so that she could pay it back.</i>

1:03:51.200 --> 1:03:52.800
But she didn't want to take that either.

1:03:53.520 --> 1:03:55.800
I think she was afraid
of not being able to.

1:03:56.720 --> 1:03:58.480
I just don't get it.

1:03:58.560 --> 1:04:00.400
I mean, they work so hard
to keep this place going,

1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:02.520
and they're just gonna throw it all away.

1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:04.160
It would be so easy.

1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:06.760
Yes, it would be easy, Michael.

1:04:07.360 --> 1:04:09.760
But everything isn't always a quick fix.

1:04:09.840 --> 1:04:11.920
Yeah, well, I'm not giving up that easy.

1:04:12.680 --> 1:04:15.880
They need this place.
I'm gonna find a way for them to keep it.

1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:19.280
See, you start the pyramid, right?

1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:21.360
Which puts you on the top.

1:04:21.440 --> 1:04:24.400
And the people on the bottom
have to each pay $1,500 to get in on it.

1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:27.600
Now, when your pyramid fills up,
you've made $12,000.

1:04:27.680 --> 1:04:29.800
Now, the guy that was below you,
when he moves up to the top

1:04:29.880 --> 1:04:32.000
and his pyramid fills up,
he makes $12,000.

1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:37.160
So I figure that if you, me,
Mule, Jules, and Tommy all start one,

1:04:37.240 --> 1:04:38.920
that's like $70,000.

1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.280
And then, you know, we'd get
a lot more people to join in on it.

1:04:41.360 --> 1:04:44.880
These people that give you the money,
what happens to them?

1:04:45.560 --> 1:04:49.200
Well, uh, when they reach the top,
they make $12,000, just like you.

1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:52.000
What if they don't reach the top?

1:04:52.600 --> 1:04:55.320
Then they lose.
I mean, you know, there are certain risks.

1:04:55.400 --> 1:04:57.640
Sounds like gambling to me.

1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:00.200
Now you're catching on.

1:05:01.760 --> 1:05:04.080
You ain't gonna find any gamblers
around here, son.

1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:06.280
People work too hard
to maybe lose their money.

1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:08.880
Besides, it don't sound exactly legal.

1:05:09.880 --> 1:05:12.000
Yeah, but it's a chance
for them to keep the ranch.

1:05:12.080 --> 1:05:13.920
So, are you in on it, or what?

1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:17.400
I mean, look, all we have to do
is just get two people to join in on it.

1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:19.200
And then those two people
gotta get two people.

1:05:19.280 --> 1:05:21.240
It's like a piece of cake.

1:05:23.160 --> 1:05:25.800
Look, it's a...

1:05:25.880 --> 1:05:28.240
It's a good thing,
you trying to help Jules and Tommy.

1:05:28.360 --> 1:05:31.200
But you're milking the wrong cow
trying to do it this way.

1:05:32.040 --> 1:05:34.680
I mean, if I had 1,500 bucks,
I wouldn't need no pyramid.

1:05:34.760 --> 1:05:36.320
I'd just give it to 'em.

1:05:36.560 --> 1:05:38.840
And so would
a lot of other folks around here.

1:05:38.920 --> 1:05:40.440
But even at that,

1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:42.720

enough sweat working it,

1:05:52.840 --> 1:05:56.240

don't make any sense to keep going.

1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:37.920
Yeah.

1:19:38.560 --> 1:19:40.880
Yeah, I'm just thinking, that's all.

1:19:43.600 --> 1:19:45.440
Well, have a great time.

1:19:46.360 --> 1:19:47.760
Thanks, Arlene.

1:19:48.880 --> 1:19:50.360
Thanks for everything.

1:20:30.760 --> 1:20:32.280

DRIVER: Here. Let me get that
for you, sir.

1:20:33.720 --> 1:20:35.280
No, no, no, it's okay.
I'm gonna hold on to them, thanks.

1:20:35.360 --> 1:20:38.400
Don't be silly. Give them to him.
That's what he's paid for.

1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:41.760
I'm not going.

1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:45.560

1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:49.800

important that I have to do, Gina.

Michael, I have to advise you,

1:21:14.360 --> 1:21:18.160
there are penalties for liquidating
some of these assets in your trust fund.

1:21:18.360 --> 1:21:20.000
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1:21:22.480 --> 1:21:24.720
Yes, I'm sure.

1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:51.160
-Dishes are all packed, Mom.
-Oh, thanks, honey.

1:21:56.960 --> 1:21:58.480
It's going to be okay, Tommy.

1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:01.000
We'll make it.

1:22:02.080 --> 1:22:03.920

What are you doing here?

1:22:35.840 --> 1:22:37.480
This is your money, isn't it?

No. It's yours.

But I can't take this.

1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:52.720
Well, I'm not giving it to you.

1:22:53.280 --> 1:22:54.320
It's an investment.

1:22:55.120 --> 1:22:57.000
I wanna see this place work.

1:22:57.120 --> 1:23:00.240
Well, it's a bad investment,
Michael, believe me.

1:23:00.880 --> 1:23:03.440
It's why I wouldn't borrow money
from your dad.

1:23:04.480 --> 1:23:07.760
I have tried so many ways
to make this place work,

1:23:07.840 --> 1:23:10.880
but the signs are right here
in front of me.

1:23:12.880 --> 1:23:14.320
It's time to move on.

1:23:15.800 --> 1:23:17.280
Please.

1:23:21.520 --> 1:23:24.800
Your giving comes from the right place.

1:23:26.240 --> 1:23:27.760
Don't lose that.

1:23:39.560 --> 1:23:40.960
So, that's it then, huh?

1:23:42.760 --> 1:23:44.080
It's over?

1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:47.560
We're going to be fine.

-Sit it on this table.
-Okay.

1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:49.320
Let me just check this out here.

Hey, look at this. A-plus. That's not bad.

Last class I took, I got a "D."

-What subject?
-Oh, it was so boring.

1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:02.640
It was real estate development.

1:25:02.720 --> 1:25:04.200
It had to do with land trusts

1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:06.960
and property deeds,
mergers, things like that.

-Michael, what's up?
-I gotta check something out, man.

1:25:15.600 --> 1:25:19.480
Yeah, I got it. A "D"? Michael.

1:25:19.560 --> 1:25:22.040
Yeah, I know. I could've done better,
all right? I will next time.

1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:23.400

I've got to get my truck out.

-Yeah, just a minute, sir.
-Oh, excuse me...

Whoa.

1:26:52.560 --> 1:26:55.720
<i>One of the things my father's taught me</i>
<i>is there are no quick fixes in life.</i>

1:26:55.920 --> 1:26:59.080
And I have learned that it is hard work
and dedication in what you believe in

1:26:59.160 --> 1:27:00.680
that makes a difference.

1:27:00.760 --> 1:27:04.400
No, I have never seen anybody work
harder than my aunt and cousin.

1:27:04.480 --> 1:27:06.440
Young man, I couldn't agree
with you more, but I...

1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:07.840
Sir, I understand.

1:27:07.920 --> 1:27:11.160
You have every right to
foreclose on their property.

1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:12.280
I mean, I'm from Beverly Hills.

1:27:12.360 --> 1:27:13.760
-I understand all about money.
-You're from Beverly Hills?

1:27:13.840 --> 1:27:17.560
Yes, yes. But isn't the bottom line
in any business

1:27:17.640 --> 1:27:20.040
to make a profit,
or at least not lose money, right?

1:27:20.120 --> 1:27:22.480
-Yes, but when you...
-Look, I've done some research.

1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:25.680
Now, your bank, by no fault of your own,

1:27:25.760 --> 1:27:27.000
has been forced to foreclose

1:27:27.080 --> 1:27:29.840
on 18 ranch properties
in the last three years.

1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:32.840
And guess what?
They're all still for sale.

1:27:33.640 --> 1:27:35.680
Obviously, reflecting the times.

1:27:35.920 --> 1:27:38.160
You're losing money every day
those properties don't sell.

1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:41.200
-Aren't I right?
-Well, yes, if you look at it like that...

1:27:41.280 --> 1:27:44.840
My aunt's ranch meets all the criteria
for a land trust.

1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:46.440
Land trust?

1:27:46.520 --> 1:27:48.560
You both would have a better bottom line.

1:27:49.400 --> 1:27:51.120
You just gotta give it a chance.

1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:55.400
How about making a difference
in somebody's life, huh?

1:27:56.200 --> 1:27:57.440
A positive one.

1:27:59.760 --> 1:28:00.880

Michael, I don't know
what you think you're doing,

1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:08.280
but this auction has to continue.

1:29:08.360 --> 1:29:09.880
I told you, we don't have a choice.

1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:12.320
Yes, you do happen to have a choice.

from Mr. Hawthorne.

1:29:17.480 --> 1:29:18.800
Your dad was right, Tommy.

1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:20.720
Those wild horses, they are lucky.

1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:24.200
-Michael...
-(STAMMERS) It's called a land trust.

1:29:24.360 --> 1:29:26.280
I learned about it when I was in school.

1:29:26.360 --> 1:29:27.800
Well, sort of.

1:29:27.880 --> 1:29:30.640
See, your land supports
a herd of wild horses,

1:29:30.760 --> 1:29:33.240
animals that should be allowed
to live in their natural habitat.

1:29:33.320 --> 1:29:35.880
The land trust ensures them
a home forever.

1:29:35.960 --> 1:29:37.320
That's what it's there for,

1:29:37.400 --> 1:29:39.760
protection of wild animals
and their habitats.

1:29:40.480 --> 1:29:42.840
But what about the money that we owe?

1:29:42.960 --> 1:29:44.680
Well, it's not 100% for sure.

1:29:44.800 --> 1:29:47.000
But if your land is accepted by the trust,

1:29:47.080 --> 1:29:49.760
which it should be
because it meets all the requirements,

1:29:49.960 --> 1:29:51.480
your debt is covered by it.

1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:54.760
So we get to stay?

1:29:55.440 --> 1:29:56.480
Yes.

1:29:56.800 --> 1:29:58.520
Now, you won't own the land anymore,

1:29:58.640 --> 1:30:01.480
but they will pay you
to stay on and manage it.

1:30:02.360 --> 1:30:05.840
(LAUGHS) I don't know what to say.

1:30:06.800 --> 1:30:08.440
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1:30:08.960 --> 1:30:11.080
-Thank you.
-Sure.

1:30:11.160 --> 1:30:15.280
I actually have...
I have one favor to ask of you, though.

1:30:16.280 --> 1:30:17.720
Anything.

1:30:18.320 --> 1:30:19.920
I was wondering if I could, uh,

1:30:20.800 --> 1:30:24.880
stay here for a little while longer
and see this trust through?

1:30:26.960 --> 1:30:28.800
You can stay as long as you'd like.

1:30:31.280 --> 1:30:32.760
Thanks.

1:30:34.960 --> 1:30:36.480
Five! Yeah!

1:30:46.800 --> 1:30:48.280
Can I ask you something?

1:30:48.360 --> 1:30:50.000
Shoot. Anything.

1:30:50.600 --> 1:30:52.720
Do you feel like
working on the tree house?

1:30:53.600 --> 1:30:54.880
Are you sure?

1:30:54.960 --> 1:30:56.920
Yes. Really sure.

1:30:58.480 --> 1:30:59.720
-Come on.
-I'll race you.

1:30:59.800 --> 1:31:00.960
I'll race you.
