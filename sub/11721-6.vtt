<i>Previously on</i> Hawaii Five-O...

00:05.466 --> 00:08.052
<i> There's a vintage</i>
<i> bookshop in town...</i>

00:08.053 --> 00:10.287
<i>that's a cover for</i>
<i> a counterfeiting operation.</i>

00:10.289 --> 00:12.156
Jerry, you might be on
to something here, okay?

00:12.158 --> 00:13.524
But you can't
be doing this.

00:13.526 --> 00:14.591
You're a civilian.

00:14.593 --> 00:16.460
<i>Thomas Farrow is clean.</i>

00:16.462 --> 00:17.594
<i>His business is legit.</i>

00:17.596 --> 00:18.996
<i> This guy is</i>
<i> counterfeiting money.</i>

00:18.998 --> 00:20.697
Thank you, sir.
<i> I'm sure of it.</i>

00:20.699 --> 00:21.765
Who is he?

00:21.767 --> 00:22.933
If he knows,

00:22.935 --> 00:24.601
we're gonna have
to deal with that.

00:24.603 --> 00:26.737
There's a listening device
implanted in the spine.

00:26.739 --> 00:28.505
<i>I just need someone to walk</i>
<i> into that store</i>

00:28.507 --> 00:29.606
<i>and sell it for me.</i>

00:29.608 --> 00:31.942
My uncle recently passed away.

00:31.944 --> 00:33.777
Found this in his attic.

00:33.779 --> 00:36.613
Looks like it might
be worth something.

00:36.615 --> 00:38.315
You have yourself a deal.

00:42.153 --> 00:43.620
Hello, Mr. Ortega.

00:43.622 --> 00:44.821
What are you doing here?

00:44.823 --> 00:46.723
Returning your book.

00:46.725 --> 00:48.925
Did you ever read it?

00:48.927 --> 00:51.261
There's a passage in here
that warns of the perils

00:51.263 --> 00:54.431
of meddling
in someone else's affairs.

00:54.433 --> 00:58.268
He who does
will face retribution.

01:21.158 --> 01:23.126
Where's the enthusiasm, kids?

01:23.128 --> 01:25.428
Better get those
sugar levels up.

01:29.633 --> 01:31.367
Is, is that blood?

01:32.169 --> 01:33.836
Oh.

01:33.838 --> 01:36.172
That.

01:37.441 --> 01:40.376
I was just carving up the corpse
of a man I recently murdered.

01:42.913 --> 01:44.113
Mmm.

01:45.182 --> 01:46.415
Corn syrup.

01:46.417 --> 01:49.185
Red food coloring
and just a pinch of flour.

01:49.187 --> 01:52.955
That, children, is the secret
to realistic fake blood.

01:53.824 --> 01:55.324
Happy Halloween.

01:56.126 --> 01:57.894
That was weird...

02:25.689 --> 02:27.723
Right.

02:27.725 --> 02:29.758
Where were we?

02:32.296 --> 02:33.929
Okay, message delivered.

02:33.931 --> 02:35.464
I won't say a word
about anything.

02:35.466 --> 02:37.499
Just, please,
stop hurting him!

02:39.370 --> 02:40.903
Such compassion.
But you see,

02:40.905 --> 02:43.205
while you were just following
your natural curiosity,

02:43.207 --> 02:45.808
my associate here failed
to do his job.

02:45.810 --> 02:49.211
Which was to protect
our interests from prying eyes.

02:49.213 --> 02:52.247
Well, consider
my prying eyes diverted.

02:52.249 --> 02:53.749
Look, I get it.

02:53.751 --> 02:55.117
You just want to run

02:55.119 --> 02:56.685
your nice friendly
counterfeiting operation

02:56.687 --> 02:58.320
out of your
antiquarian bookshop.

02:58.322 --> 03:00.255
We all have hobbies.

03:00.257 --> 03:01.490
Exactly!

03:01.492 --> 03:02.624
Ours just happen to intersect.

03:02.626 --> 03:04.793
Excuse me one moment.

03:08.232 --> 03:10.232
Oh, my God, you killed him!
Why would you do that?!

03:10.234 --> 03:12.034
Please don't.

03:12.036 --> 03:15.404
Now, I want to know everything
you told Steve McGarrett.

Flight landed hours ago.

04:49.932 --> 04:53.134
I swung by your place,
tried calling you a bunch.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.505
Yeah, I didn't feel like, uh,
going home yet, you know?

05:01.843 --> 05:03.911
Yeah, I figured.

you telling me about this place.

So...

06:07.309 --> 06:08.341
What are you doing?

06:08.343 --> 06:09.376
Don't do that, man.

06:09.378 --> 06:10.877
Don't do that.
It's true...

06:10.879 --> 06:12.379
Don't do that, man.
It's true.

06:12.381 --> 06:15.449
What, are you gonna second-guess
every decision you make?

06:15.451 --> 06:17.083
I did that
with my old man, Danny.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.019
I did that with Freddie, too.

06:19.021 --> 06:21.888
The truth is I could never
have saved either of them.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.760
Don't do that to yourself.

06:37.172 --> 06:38.738
Well, Samantha's a
little old for it,

06:38.740 --> 06:40.373
and after what she
went through, you know,

06:40.375 --> 06:41.841
she still likes to
stay close to home.

06:41.843 --> 06:43.176
But the boy--

06:43.178 --> 06:45.645
might as well be the
Super Bowl tonight.

06:45.647 --> 06:47.614
Been gearing up
for it for weeks.

06:47.616 --> 06:50.116
I paid $50 just for
his costume alone.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.051
He's only gonna
wear it once.

06:52.053 --> 06:54.053
All this for
a pile of candy

06:54.055 --> 06:56.189
we're only gonna
throw in the trash.

06:56.191 --> 06:57.790
Come on, now,
be honest.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.093
All that candy doesn't
get thrown away.

07:00.095 --> 07:01.594
Well, the house
gets its rake.

07:01.596 --> 07:03.596
But, uh, mostly Twix.

07:04.798 --> 07:06.332
Gentlemen, the
good news is

07:06.334 --> 07:08.267
our homicide victim
is well-preserved.

07:08.269 --> 07:10.403
The bad news-- it's
below zero in there..

07:11.840 --> 07:14.340
You know what we call
below zero in Chicago?

07:14.342 --> 07:16.476
April.

07:19.213 --> 07:21.647
Henry Chun, manager
of the restaurant.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.150
Kitchen staff showed up for
work and found him like this.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.118
Uh, the safe and the
register were both untouched.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.254
The same can't be said
about the victim's tongue.

07:30.190 --> 07:32.525
Max, get that thing
out of my face.

07:32.527 --> 07:34.093
Oh, forgive me.

07:34.095 --> 07:36.762
The clean cut suggests that the
tongue was removed post-mortem.

07:36.764 --> 07:40.633
The victim likely bled out
from the multiple stab wounds

07:40.635 --> 07:42.301
to the chest and the abdomen.

07:42.303 --> 07:44.370
I counted at least 17 of them.

07:44.372 --> 07:45.571
All right, well,
let's have CSU collect

07:45.573 --> 07:46.639
all the knives in the place,

07:46.641 --> 07:48.040
see if one of them comes back

07:48.042 --> 07:49.074
as our murder weapon.

07:49.076 --> 07:50.576
Okay, stabbing someone 17 times.

07:50.578 --> 07:52.611
It's possible our killer got
caught up in the moment.

07:52.613 --> 07:54.513
But cutting out the tongue,
that's about sending a message.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.215
So, maybe our Vic
runs his mouth off

07:56.217 --> 07:57.616
about something
and it gets him killed.

07:57.618 --> 08:00.052
Well, we find out
what that something is,

08:00.054 --> 08:02.221
we find our killer.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.496
A motorist found him wandering
the streets up in Waimanalo.

08:13.497 --> 08:14.849
He was dehydrated
and disoriented.

08:14.850 --> 08:17.083
Said he'd talk
only to Five-O.

08:21.470 --> 08:23.604
All right...

08:24.139 --> 08:26.873
Jerry, just take your time
and tell us what happened.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.143
When I got home,
Farrow was waiting for me.

08:30.912 --> 08:32.145
Wait a minute, Farrow--

08:32.147 --> 08:34.246
Farrow the bookshop owner
that you were surveilling?

08:34.249 --> 08:36.982
He put one of those Guantanamo
hoods on my head.

08:36.985 --> 08:39.486
And took me to a house somewhere
and was questioning me.

08:39.488 --> 08:42.889
Kind of
like <i> Marathon Man,</i>

08:42.890 --> 08:45.158
but without the dental abuse.

08:45.160 --> 08:47.661
And instead of torturing me, he
was beating on this other guy.

08:47.663 --> 08:50.030
What, uh, what
other guy?

08:50.032 --> 08:51.465
Who is he?

08:51.467 --> 08:54.467
I don't know his name, but
he's in on the counterfeiting.

08:54.469 --> 08:55.502
Or he <i> was.</i>

08:55.504 --> 08:56.836
What do you mean "he was"?

08:56.838 --> 08:58.905
Farrow killed him
right in front of me.

09:00.908 --> 09:01.942
It's all my fault.

09:01.944 --> 09:03.977
Wait, why would Farrow
kill his own man?

09:03.979 --> 09:06.780
For letting me get too close.

09:06.782 --> 09:08.581
Please don't!

09:08.583 --> 09:11.584
I want to know everything
you told Steve McGarrett.

09:11.586 --> 09:12.952
I told him everything!

09:12.954 --> 09:15.221
He didn't believe me, even
told me to stop spying on you!

09:15.223 --> 09:17.991
If I had told him
the truth from the beginning,

09:17.993 --> 09:19.325
that guy would still be alive.

09:19.327 --> 09:21.828
What have I told you
from the beginning, Jerry?

09:21.830 --> 09:22.862
I told you to back off.

09:22.864 --> 09:23.930
What were you thinking?

09:23.932 --> 09:24.932
I don't know.

09:24.933 --> 09:26.833
That I was right,
and you were wrong.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.769
Look, I only did it
for a couple weeks.

09:29.771 --> 09:31.838
Farrow must have
found out,

09:31.840 --> 09:33.473
and grabbed me
to see what I know.

09:33.475 --> 09:35.008
But he slipped up.

09:35.010 --> 09:37.543
That doesn't
change anything.

09:37.545 --> 09:39.979
That money still leaves
the island tonight.

09:39.981 --> 09:42.715
Okay, Jerry, um...
that doesn't make sense.

09:42.717 --> 09:43.883
I'm sorry.

09:43.885 --> 09:45.918
If this guy had a plan to
move that money tonight,

09:45.920 --> 09:47.954
why would he, why would
he just let you go?

09:47.956 --> 09:49.522
I don't know.

09:49.524 --> 09:50.857
He's a criminal
mastermind.

09:50.859 --> 09:53.292
But you can bet he has a plan.

09:53.294 --> 09:56.195
Look, I know
it sounds crazy.

09:56.197 --> 09:58.297
And I'm sorry I went
behind your back.

09:58.299 --> 10:00.733
But I'm telling you the truth,
and I can prove it.

10:04.371 --> 10:07.573
Jerry, tell me the, uh,
the movers already came

10:07.575 --> 10:08.841
and picked up
your stuff.

10:08.843 --> 10:11.610
No, they're not coming
till next week.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.048
This was Farrow.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.050
He took everything--

10:17.051 --> 10:18.684
my files, my backups,

10:18.686 --> 10:20.686
my backups
of my backups...

10:20.688 --> 10:22.855
Well, you must have backups
someplace else.

10:22.857 --> 10:24.290
No, all my backups
were here.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.227
This was my life's work.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.100
You had hours of
recorded conversations,

10:35.102 --> 10:36.835
surveillance photos.

10:36.837 --> 10:37.970
That's what
Farrow was doing.

10:37.972 --> 10:39.104
You know that, right?

10:39.106 --> 10:40.940
He's destroying everything
you had on him.

10:42.008 --> 10:44.009
So, you believe me?

10:44.011 --> 10:46.011
Yeah.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.747
I, um... TBD.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.816
That's good enough for me.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.351
Now, can we go arrest this guy?

10:52.353 --> 10:54.686
Whatever happened
to "immunity and means"?

10:54.688 --> 10:56.622
Since when does Five-O
need a warrant?

10:56.624 --> 10:58.223
Since you decided
to conduct

10:58.225 --> 10:59.958
your own illegal surveillance
operation, Jerry.

10:59.960 --> 11:00.926
Oh, right.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.861
Good point;
at my bad.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.163
We want
to protect you, okay?

11:04.165 --> 11:05.264
If you're wrong,
you could go to jail.

11:05.266 --> 11:07.466
So, when we get
in there,

11:07.468 --> 11:08.500
Copy that.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.869
I'm sorry, I just...

11:10.871 --> 11:14.072
I don't see how any judge is
gonna sign off on a warrant.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.742
"Recent and reliable
information,"

11:16.744 --> 11:17.642
that's the criteria.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.511
You have the "recent,"

11:19.513 --> 11:22.013
but I'm not so sure
about the "reliable" part.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.682
What are you saying?

11:23.684 --> 11:27.219
You're a self-published
conspiracy theorist

11:27.221 --> 11:28.420
who was breaking the law.

11:28.422 --> 11:30.122
Hey, I <i> am</i> reliable.

11:30.124 --> 11:31.690
I helped Five-O find
the Black Unicorn.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.558
Excuse me?

11:33.560 --> 11:34.993
What'd I just say?

11:34.995 --> 11:36.795
Outside,
about not talking?

11:36.797 --> 11:38.096
What'd I say
about not talking?

11:38.098 --> 11:40.365
Listen, I know it's
a lot to ask, Ellie,

11:40.367 --> 11:42.701
but if I had another option,
I wouldn't be here.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.607
Okay, look, it's a long shot,

11:49.609 --> 11:51.910
but I'll give it a try
'cause I owe you one.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.311
Thanks,
that's all I'm asking.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.512
Thank you.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.218
<i> All right, thanks, Duke.</i>

12:00.220 --> 12:03.087
HPD ran our Vic,
Henry Chun.

12:03.089 --> 12:05.423
No criminal record, and,
according to friends and family,

12:05.425 --> 12:06.858
he wasn't having trouble
with anyone.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.259
That they know of.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.661
Somebody really went
out of their way

12:09.663 --> 12:11.896
to kill this guy
in brutal fashion.

12:14.667 --> 12:18.369
That's a real nice
costume you got there, Doc.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.304
You know, my son's
going as a Ninja Turtle.

12:20.306 --> 12:22.407
He's 12.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.243
Don't mind him, Max.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.311
Look, every Halloween,
Max dresses up

12:27.313 --> 12:29.047
as a character fro
a Keanu Reaves movie.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.115
Except I wouldn't say
<i> The Replacements</i> is

12:31.117 --> 12:32.517
his strongest work.

12:34.653 --> 12:37.255
If you were well-versed,
in the Keanu oeuvre,

12:37.257 --> 12:38.890
you'd know that nine was
the number worn

12:38.892 --> 12:40.691
by the character
Jotah

12:40.693 --> 12:43.427
from the 1991 masterpiece,
<i>Point Break.</i>

12:43.429 --> 12:45.563
I'm gonna give
you a tip.

12:45.565 --> 12:49.033
If you have to explain your
Halloween costume to someone,

12:49.035 --> 12:50.534
it's probably not
a good costume.

12:50.536 --> 12:51.602
Okay, uh...

12:51.604 --> 12:53.771
Max, so, what do
you have for us?

12:53.773 --> 12:57.108
Well, I can safely say
that our murder weapon wasn't

12:57.110 --> 12:59.610
among the knives collected
from the restaurant.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.346
My autopsy shows that
the stab wounds were inflicted

13:02.348 --> 13:03.881
by a uniquely curved blade.

13:03.883 --> 13:05.349
In fact, it is of my opinion,

13:05.351 --> 13:07.985
that our murder weapon
isn't a knife at all.

13:07.987 --> 13:10.087
I believe it's a sickle.

13:12.724 --> 13:14.358
What kind of a
maniac uses a weapon

13:14.360 --> 13:16.927
like that mutilate
and kill someone?

13:16.929 --> 13:18.262
I'm thinking maybe
it's not a coincidence

13:18.264 --> 13:20.731
this thing happened
on Halloween.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.401
It's Eddie...

13:24.403 --> 13:26.804
...Quist.

13:40.853 --> 13:43.353
Hey, give me some good news.

13:43.355 --> 13:44.721
Sorry, struck out.

13:44.723 --> 13:46.690
What'd the judge say?

13:46.692 --> 13:48.192
I don't know
if he was more surprised

13:48.194 --> 13:49.226
by the actual warrant request,

13:49.228 --> 13:50.894
or the fact that
you even asked for one.

13:50.896 --> 13:53.063
Apparently,
Five-O has a reputation

13:53.065 --> 13:54.331
for being gung ho cowboys.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.166
His words.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.701
It's, uh...

13:57.703 --> 13:58.902
it's gross exaggerated.

13:58.904 --> 14:01.038
Well, maybe so,

14:01.040 --> 14:03.540
but I threw every legal
precedent at the guy,

14:03.542 --> 14:04.741
and he wouldn't budge.

14:04.743 --> 14:07.077
I'm sorry I couldn't
come through.

14:07.079 --> 14:10.180
All right. Thanks, Ellie,
I appreciate it.

14:12.083 --> 14:13.917
Well?

14:13.919 --> 14:15.152
We're good to go.

14:15.154 --> 14:17.120
Stay put, Jer.

14:18.990 --> 14:20.724
Really? We're
good to go?

14:20.726 --> 14:23.860
I believe Jerry, that's all
the probable cause I need.

14:25.530 --> 14:26.530
Hey, Five-O.

14:26.531 --> 14:28.164
Hey, what are you doing?
On your knees.

14:28.166 --> 14:29.566
Hands behind your head.
Hands behind your head!

14:29.568 --> 14:30.533
Get on your knees!

14:30.535 --> 14:31.568
Right now,
hands behind your head.

14:31.570 --> 14:32.902
And lock your fingers.

14:33.838 --> 14:35.438
What the bloody hell
is going on?

14:35.440 --> 14:36.539
Shut up, don't move.

14:43.247 --> 14:44.380
Where were you
this afternoon?

14:44.382 --> 14:45.382
What?

14:45.383 --> 14:47.550
Where were you this afternoon?

14:47.552 --> 14:49.853
I was here, handing out candy.

14:49.855 --> 14:51.554
It's what you do at Halloween.

14:51.556 --> 14:53.056
Anybody back that up?

14:53.058 --> 14:54.958
I don't know, try every
kid in the neighborhood.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.059
Look, would you
mind telling me

14:56.061 --> 14:57.227
what the bloody hell
is going on?

14:57.229 --> 14:58.394
Get up.

14:58.396 --> 15:00.530
Up. Up.

15:10.174 --> 15:11.874
You've been accused
of kidnapping and murder.

15:11.876 --> 15:13.910
By who?

15:13.912 --> 15:15.511
Me!

15:17.214 --> 15:19.282
Yeah, this is where he held me.

15:19.284 --> 15:22.885
And that room back there is
where he shot the guy.

15:22.887 --> 15:24.587
What...?

15:24.589 --> 15:26.722
What... I don't know
who this man is,

15:26.724 --> 15:28.024
but he's clearly deranged.

15:28.026 --> 15:29.792
I've never seen him
before in my life.

15:29.794 --> 15:30.960
He's lying.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.430
Bring in the crime-lab guys,
tear this place apart.

15:34.432 --> 15:35.598
There's got to be evidence here.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.700
Presume you have
a search warrant.

15:37.702 --> 15:39.635
Hell, yeah, we do.

15:39.637 --> 15:41.470
Show him, McGarrett.

15:44.141 --> 15:45.941
Turn around.

15:52.949 --> 15:54.283
Sorry for the misunderstanding,
Mr. Farrow.

15:54.285 --> 15:56.051
We'll be
on our way now.

15:56.053 --> 15:58.988
Let's go, Jerry.

15:58.990 --> 16:00.122
Wait, we're just leaving?

16:00.124 --> 16:02.124
Let's go.

16:02.126 --> 16:04.126
You have a lovely home.

16:07.897 --> 16:09.331
Hey, Duke,
it's McGarrett.

16:09.333 --> 16:10.799
I need a full
surveillance package.

16:10.801 --> 16:12.735
Subject's name
is Thomas Farrow.

16:12.737 --> 16:14.603
I want a unit
on him 24-7,

16:14.605 --> 16:17.306
and I want updates on
any and all activity.

16:18.575 --> 16:19.742
Wait, what's going on?

16:19.744 --> 16:21.710
Yes, what is
going on, Steve?

16:21.712 --> 16:25.047
He had what looked to me like
a shrapnel scar on his arm.

16:25.049 --> 16:28.484
The type I've only
ever seen in battle.

16:28.486 --> 16:30.018
But HPD background check
didn't mention anything

16:30.020 --> 16:32.254
about military service.
That's right.

16:32.256 --> 16:34.756
I don't think Thomas Farrow is
who he says he is.

16:41.031 --> 16:42.898
Okay, first a tongue,
now eyes.

16:42.900 --> 16:44.333
I'm gonna go
out on a limb

16:44.335 --> 16:45.701
and say these
two murders are connected.

16:45.703 --> 16:47.703
Which means we have
a serial killer

16:47.705 --> 16:49.538
with a lot more body
parts to choose from.

16:49.540 --> 16:52.808
All right, we need to
get in touch with the FBI.

16:52.810 --> 16:54.643
See if they've got anything
matching this killer's MO.

16:54.645 --> 16:56.845
Might not be
the first time.

16:59.782 --> 17:01.716
Max, what's wrong?

17:03.653 --> 17:05.854
I know who our killer is.

17:12.502 --> 17:17.757
<i> Last Halloween,</i>
<i>something terrible happened...</i>

17:21.744 --> 17:25.981
<i>It started as a prank...</i>

17:25.983 --> 17:29.485
<i>and ended in murder.</i>

17:30.787 --> 17:34.790
<i>They thought they could</i>
<i> bury the past...</i>

17:34.792 --> 17:37.993
<i>but this Halloween,</i>

17:37.995 --> 17:40.496
<i>they're going to learn--</i>

17:40.498 --> 17:42.731
<i>evil begets evil!</i>

17:45.034 --> 17:47.136
Allow me to introduce you
to our killer-- Jack Knife.

17:47.138 --> 17:51.473
Released in 1984, it was
originally panned by critics

17:51.475 --> 17:54.610
as a pale knockoff of
John Carpenter's <i> Halloween.</i>

17:54.612 --> 17:55.944
However,
in recent years,

17:55.946 --> 17:58.780
it is enjoying a well-deserved,
rabid cult following from...

17:58.782 --> 18:01.083
Would you stop with
the film-school lecture

18:01.085 --> 18:03.018
and just let us see
the rest of it.

18:03.020 --> 18:03.986
Fine.

18:03.988 --> 18:05.654
But pay very
close attention.

18:05.656 --> 18:08.423
The next part may
look familiar.

18:08.425 --> 18:09.425
Tad?

18:09.426 --> 18:11.660
I thought you could use
an extra hand.

18:18.035 --> 18:21.603
Tongue cut out, killed
with a sickle and strung up.

18:21.605 --> 18:23.839
It's just like
our first Vic, Henry Chun.

18:23.841 --> 18:25.373
Okay, so, we have
a copycat killer

18:25.375 --> 18:27.175
who's reenacting
scenes from this movie.

18:27.177 --> 18:29.444
What's the body count
in this thing, Doc?

18:29.446 --> 18:30.879
Surprisingly,
only three.

18:30.881 --> 18:33.381
However, Jack Knife took
a token from each kill.

18:33.383 --> 18:35.450
First the tongue,
then his eyes;

18:35.452 --> 18:36.652
the last victim
loses his ears.

18:36.653 --> 18:39.487
"See no evil, hear no evil,
speak no evil."

18:39.489 --> 18:41.756
Great, now our killer's gonna
be looking for someone else.

18:41.758 --> 18:45.260
Okay, but...
I mean, why now?

18:45.262 --> 18:46.995
This movie's
30 years old.

18:46.997 --> 18:49.197
Not to mention, very
difficult to get a hold of.

18:49.199 --> 18:50.665
I had to employ
my superior eBay skills

18:50.667 --> 18:52.167
to procure this bootleg
VHS copy from Japan.

18:52.169 --> 18:53.635
Okay, the fact that

18:53.637 --> 18:55.270
it's really rare might help us.
I'm gonna go check online,

18:55.272 --> 18:56.805
see if there's been
any recent sales.

18:58.942 --> 19:00.208
All right, look,

19:00.210 --> 19:02.810
I-I get the guy who sees <i> Top Gun</i>
and wants to enlist,

19:02.812 --> 19:06.281
but what kind of lunatic sees
a stupid slasher film

19:06.283 --> 19:08.716
and then identifies
with a pumpkin-head killer?

19:08.718 --> 19:10.451
Oh, I can field
that one.

19:10.453 --> 19:12.520
Jack Knife is one of
the first anti-heroes

19:12.522 --> 19:13.955
to emerge from
the slasher film genre.

19:13.957 --> 19:17.625
Freddy Kruger, Mike Myers, those
were guys you ran away from.

19:17.627 --> 19:19.494
But in this day and age,
with all the bullying,

19:19.496 --> 19:21.929
modern audiences tend
to sympathize with Jack Knife.

19:21.931 --> 19:24.532
We are rooting for him
to get his revenge.

19:24.534 --> 19:27.235
So, our murders could
be revenge killings.

19:27.237 --> 19:29.504
If that's true, then our victims
weren't chosen at random.

19:29.506 --> 19:30.538
Well, it's also worth noting

19:30.540 --> 19:31.906
that they're both
about the same age-- 48.

19:31.908 --> 19:34.308
All right, well,
then we need to find out

19:34.310 --> 19:35.810
what else they have in common.

19:35.812 --> 19:37.278
If we can make a connection,

19:37.280 --> 19:39.313
it could help identify who
our killer's targeting next.

19:39.315 --> 19:41.849
Okay, here's who
Thomas Farrow is on paper:

19:41.851 --> 19:45.419
Educated at Oxford, moved
here from Britain in 2012,

19:45.421 --> 19:46.754
his business license shows

19:46.756 --> 19:48.389
that he opened his bookshop
two months later.

19:48.391 --> 19:50.224
Okay, so, in theory, uh...

19:50.226 --> 19:52.393
for two years, this guy
has been running his bookshop

19:52.395 --> 19:53.594
as a front to counterfeit cash.

19:53.596 --> 19:55.663
Why has it not showed up
on the radar, yet?

19:55.665 --> 19:58.098
Well, you heard McGarrett,
the guy's former military.

19:58.100 --> 19:59.266
Which means we could be dealing

19:59.268 --> 20:00.668
with a highly skilled
individual.

20:00.670 --> 20:02.670
Fluent in spycraft, capable
of creating a ghost identity

20:02.672 --> 20:05.306
that can withstand
any background checks.

20:05.308 --> 20:08.676
My money's on him
being an MI-6 bad-ass.

20:09.678 --> 20:10.945
That's British Secret
Intelligence Service.

20:10.947 --> 20:13.047
I know.
I've seen James Bond.

20:13.049 --> 20:14.315
All right.

20:14.317 --> 20:16.083
Interpol came up empty
on Farrow.

20:16.085 --> 20:18.118
What about the Brits?

20:18.120 --> 20:19.787
I sent his photo to
their Ministry of Defense.

20:19.789 --> 20:21.555
They said they'd run it up the
chain but it may take some time.

20:21.557 --> 20:24.158
And you bought that?

20:24.160 --> 20:25.426
It's 2014, any kid
with a cell phone

20:25.428 --> 20:26.760
can do a facial rec and I.D.

20:26.762 --> 20:28.362
They're stalling.

20:29.330 --> 20:31.131
Wait a minute--
if Farrow's government knows

20:31.133 --> 20:34.401
that he was, uh, counterfeiting
cash on U.S. soil,

20:34.403 --> 20:36.069
maybe they're not
so eager to claim him.

20:36.071 --> 20:37.538
True.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.806
Hey, can you guys manage
here without me?

20:40.642 --> 20:43.310
No.
Well, you're gonna have to.

20:43.312 --> 20:44.678
I have a British source.

20:44.680 --> 20:47.881
He's kind of my one-stop-shop
for all Brit-related Intel.

20:47.883 --> 20:49.750
We also watch
<i> Doctor Who</i> together.

20:49.752 --> 20:51.385
Huh.

20:51.387 --> 20:54.688
Okay, look, I-I,
I-I love the guy.

20:54.690 --> 20:56.156
I do.

20:56.158 --> 20:57.324
I think he's fantastic.

20:57.326 --> 20:59.192
And I'd like to believe him,
but we have nothing.

20:59.194 --> 21:00.894
We have no body, we have
no counterfeit money.

21:00.896 --> 21:03.296
Now, look, Jerry's eccentric,
Danny, but he's not crazy.

21:03.298 --> 21:06.533
I mean, why would Farrow
even be interested in Jerry

21:06.535 --> 21:08.301
if he didn't think
he was on to something?

21:08.303 --> 21:10.370
By that same rationale,

21:10.372 --> 21:13.373
why would he let him go if he
was moving that money tonight?

21:13.375 --> 21:14.841
Unless that's his plan.

21:14.843 --> 21:18.278
He knew Jerry would come back
and tell us everything, right?

21:18.280 --> 21:20.180
Maybe he's waiting to see
how we would react.

21:21.249 --> 21:23.216
So, what, we just wait--

21:23.218 --> 21:24.918
sit back and wait
and see what happens?

21:24.920 --> 21:26.052
Hold on.

21:26.054 --> 21:27.854
Duke.

21:29.590 --> 21:31.925
All right, put a unit on him,
we're on the way.

21:31.927 --> 21:33.893
Right on cue.

21:33.895 --> 21:36.096
Farrow loaded up the van,
he's headed to the airport.

21:47.141 --> 21:48.808
Step away from the vehicle.

21:48.810 --> 21:50.210
Step forward,
and get on your knees.

21:50.212 --> 21:52.011
On your knees right now, put
your hands behind your head.

21:52.013 --> 21:53.079
That's right,
and lock your fingers.

21:53.081 --> 21:55.415
Hands behind your back,
let's go.

21:55.417 --> 21:56.783
Keep 'em there.

22:15.569 --> 22:18.404
Steve, we got nothing
but old books here.

22:26.079 --> 22:29.081
He played us.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.122
All right, here she is,

22:36.124 --> 22:38.691
in all of her mint,
first-edition glory.

22:38.693 --> 22:42.027
Bought her off a collector
in Texas a few months back.

22:42.029 --> 22:43.529
Had to throw in

22:43.531 --> 22:45.931
a 5.1 <i> Dune</i> laser disk
to close the deal.

22:45.933 --> 22:48.767
Which was cool, 'cause, I mean,
I have, like, six of them.

22:48.769 --> 22:51.036
Where were you this afternoon?
Uh, here.

22:51.038 --> 22:53.572
Halloween's one of my busiest
days of the year. Why?

22:53.574 --> 22:55.407
You rent that movie out
to anybody lately?

22:55.409 --> 22:57.876
Does this look like
Blockbuster to you?

22:57.878 --> 23:00.112
No, it doesn't,
because those don't exist.

23:00.114 --> 23:01.981
All my items are
pay-to-play.

23:01.983 --> 23:04.683
Although, I do hold
free monthly screenings.

23:04.685 --> 23:07.119
<i>Jack Knife</i> kicked off
my Halloween Slash-a-thon

23:07.121 --> 23:08.287
two weeks ago.

23:08.289 --> 23:10.556
It was a big hit.
Sold a bunch of T-shirts

23:10.558 --> 23:12.624
and replica masks.
Okay, we're gonna need

23:12.626 --> 23:15.694
to have the names of everyone who
attended this screening. Good luck.

23:15.696 --> 23:17.429
I don't even know
who was there.

23:17.431 --> 23:19.865
I just blasted an invite to
everyone on our mailing list.

23:19.867 --> 23:21.400
It's over a thousand
e-mail addresses.

23:21.402 --> 23:23.168
Yeah, well, go back
there and blast us out

23:23.170 --> 23:24.569
a copy of it there,
Blockbuster.

23:24.571 --> 23:27.105
I'll see what I can do.

23:29.443 --> 23:31.576
All right, our suspect
pool just exploded.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.578
Yeah, but the timing
does seem right.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.414
This screening
a couple weeks ago--

23:35.416 --> 23:38.150
now we got bodies dropping. Yeah.
Someone left that screening

23:38.152 --> 23:39.818
just a little
too inspired.

23:39.820 --> 23:41.520
Mm-hmm.

23:42.288 --> 23:44.723
Ugh.
What is the appeal?

23:44.725 --> 23:47.359
I don't, I don't get the appeal
to-to horror movies.

23:47.361 --> 23:49.528
What is that?

23:51.330 --> 23:53.965
What?
Nothin'.

23:53.967 --> 23:55.300
Oh, not nothin'.

23:55.302 --> 23:59.337
You got something to say--
why don't you just say it?

23:59.339 --> 24:00.905
Look, you're a
big, strong guy,

24:00.907 --> 24:02.474
and you're afraid
of horror movies.

24:02.476 --> 24:04.042
That's no judgment,
no judgment.

24:04.044 --> 24:05.243
I don't watch 'em,

24:05.245 --> 24:07.345
because they insult
my intelligence.

24:07.347 --> 24:09.347
All these stupid people
and they do stupid stuff

24:09.349 --> 24:11.816
and go in stupid rooms, and
then they end up getting killed

24:11.818 --> 24:14.219
in the worst possible way
imaginable?

24:14.221 --> 24:17.455
Let's say I hear
a noise in my garage.

24:17.457 --> 24:20.191
I get my pistol.
End of movie.

24:20.193 --> 24:23.228
All right,
here are those e-mails.

24:24.396 --> 24:26.664
Okay, great. Found
something else in the back, too.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.867
This is
for you, big guy.

24:28.869 --> 24:31.502
Take one home to your kids.
Wait, stop.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.138
You don't want this?

24:34.140 --> 24:37.108
Keep walking.

24:37.876 --> 24:41.079
Blast from the past.

24:41.081 --> 24:42.714
What you doing
with these, brah?

24:42.716 --> 24:44.582
I have two homicide victims,
and it turns out

24:44.584 --> 24:46.417
you went to high school
with both of them.

24:46.419 --> 24:50.288
They were a couple years ahead of
you-- uh, Henry Chun and Mark Lerner.

24:50.290 --> 24:52.390
Damn!

24:52.392 --> 24:54.525
Sure, I remember those guys.

24:54.527 --> 24:55.893
What happened?

24:55.895 --> 24:57.628
We're still trying
to figure that out.

24:57.630 --> 25:00.198
What can you tell me about them?
Were they friends?

25:00.200 --> 25:02.066
They were tight--
they used to go

25:02.068 --> 25:03.367
surfing together
all the time.

25:03.369 --> 25:05.736
They had a rep
for being tough guys--

25:05.738 --> 25:07.238
as much as that means

25:07.240 --> 25:09.907
in high school.
You saying they were bullies?

25:09.909 --> 25:12.176
Mm-hmm.
Strong preying on the weak.

25:12.178 --> 25:15.579
But they knew better-- they
never liked to mess with me.

25:15.581 --> 25:17.848
All right,
who did they mess with?

25:17.850 --> 25:19.150
Anyone stand out?

25:19.152 --> 25:21.919
Maybe somebody that they
targeted more than the others?

25:23.422 --> 25:26.423
The way I remember it...

25:26.425 --> 25:28.726
they were
equal-opportunity haters.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.327
And Chun and Lerner,

25:30.329 --> 25:32.496
they wasn't even
the worst of the bunch.

25:32.498 --> 25:33.864
This kid they ran with,

25:33.866 --> 25:36.500
Brad Weiss,
he was the ringleader,

25:36.502 --> 25:38.168
he was the vicious one.

25:38.170 --> 25:41.071
Mahalo. Brother, you think
Weiss did those murders?

25:41.073 --> 25:43.207
No, I think
he's our next victim.

25:56.955 --> 25:58.255
Mr. Weiss,

25:58.257 --> 25:59.389
this is the Honolulu Police
Department.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.325
You have to call us back
right away.

26:09.799 --> 26:13.068
Help!

26:16.040 --> 26:17.473
Help...!

26:18.742 --> 26:20.843
Why are you doing this?

26:20.845 --> 26:24.646
Why are you doing this to me!

26:26.149 --> 26:28.016
<i> GPS on Weiss's phone</i>

26:28.018 --> 26:29.384
shows he's at his house,
but Dispatch

26:29.386 --> 26:31.153
can't get ahold of him--
I'm on my way.

26:31.155 --> 26:32.888
Kono and I are right behind you.

26:41.699 --> 26:44.199
I want this perimeter
locked down!

26:44.201 --> 26:45.400
Nobody in or out!

27:02.551 --> 27:04.085
Guys! Out back!

27:09.058 --> 27:11.359
I'll check the perimeter.

27:16.732 --> 27:19.134
I got a pulse.

27:19.136 --> 27:21.069
I need EMT's
at the back of the house!

27:30.513 --> 27:32.046
Damn it.

27:33.483 --> 27:35.416
He's gone.

27:36.986 --> 27:39.454
<i> Where's the money?</i>

27:39.456 --> 27:41.524
Payment for those books
was made weeks ago.

27:41.525 --> 27:43.858
I was just delivering
them to the buyer.

27:45.694 --> 27:47.996
Let me ask you
a question:

27:47.998 --> 27:51.166
Do you enjoy this game you're playing?
Obviously not.

27:51.168 --> 27:54.936
I'm tied to a chair
in a windowless room

27:54.938 --> 27:57.071
with no cameras, and I haven't
the faintest idea why.

27:57.073 --> 28:00.308
Yeah, you do. Sure you do. You
know exactly why. No, I don't.

28:01.411 --> 28:03.644
You went to my home
with no warrant,

28:03.646 --> 28:06.514
you make fictitious claims
of kidnapping and murder,

28:06.516 --> 28:09.384
and then you arrest me for
conducting legitimate business.

28:09.386 --> 28:10.551
That's harassment.

28:10.553 --> 28:13.254
You have nothing
to hold me on.

28:13.256 --> 28:16.124
Actually, we do-- you failed
to fill out form 7501,

28:16.126 --> 28:18.859
authorizing the exportation
of commercial goods.

28:18.861 --> 28:21.329
A technicality usually
handled by U.S. Customs.

28:21.331 --> 28:22.964
Right, but they're
swamped right now,

28:22.966 --> 28:24.599
so we're gonna
hold the shipment

28:24.601 --> 28:26.334
and we're gonna hold you until
they can send somebody down

28:26.336 --> 28:27.768
to straighten that out--
it's probably gonna take

28:27.770 --> 28:29.070
a little while.
Meanwhile,

28:29.072 --> 28:31.372
your men are busy
searching my home

28:31.374 --> 28:34.542
and place of business to
find evidence of a crime

28:34.544 --> 28:36.377
I didn't commit.

28:36.379 --> 28:38.946
I've read my fair share
of detective novels.

28:40.282 --> 28:43.084
Well, that's good--
'cause you know how this ends.

28:43.086 --> 28:45.319
Sad, really.

28:45.321 --> 28:47.721
Smart man

28:47.723 --> 28:50.791
like yourself... willing
to risk his entire career

28:50.793 --> 28:53.894
to indulge the ramblings
of a crazy person.

28:55.564 --> 28:57.531
That's a nasty scar.

28:57.533 --> 28:59.333
How'd you get it?

29:01.136 --> 29:03.504
Automobile accident.

29:09.912 --> 29:11.278
German book buyer is legit.

29:11.280 --> 29:13.147
He's been in business
for over 20 years.

29:13.149 --> 29:15.849
Okay. So that whole
exchange was a setup.

29:15.851 --> 29:18.051
He was just testing to see
if we were watching him

29:18.053 --> 29:21.021
and we took the bait. Here's the
thing-- I think we might be too late.

29:21.023 --> 29:22.656
All right, HPD went
to the bookshop,

29:22.658 --> 29:24.691
tore the place apart, found
nothing about counterfeit money.

29:24.693 --> 29:26.760
Might have unloaded it already,
he might have, I don't know,

29:26.762 --> 29:29.196
set it in fire. Fine. We go
after him for the murder.

29:29.198 --> 29:30.731
I don't care how good you are,
you kill somebody,

29:30.733 --> 29:31.765
you're gonna leave
some evidence.

29:31.767 --> 29:33.233
All right, well,
I spoke to Fong.

29:33.235 --> 29:35.769
CSU's processing the house now.
You know, Fong better give me

29:35.771 --> 29:37.571
something soon-- I can't
hold this guy forever.

29:37.573 --> 29:39.740
Uh, one more thing--
you have a visitor.

29:41.142 --> 29:43.110
Hello.

29:43.112 --> 29:44.344
Hi.
Hey.

29:44.346 --> 29:46.880
I hope it's not a bad time.
Detective Williams

29:46.882 --> 29:49.349
said that you weren't busy--
he insisted I wait.

29:49.351 --> 29:50.351
Did he?

29:50.352 --> 29:52.018
Yeah, she was saying, uh,

29:52.020 --> 29:54.354
this guy was really nice
and polite and that he was

29:54.356 --> 29:56.022
a gentleman-- I wanted to
make sure we're talking about

29:56.024 --> 29:57.090
the same Steve
McGarrett, so...

29:57.092 --> 29:58.258
- Oh, that's funny.
Mm-hmm.

29:58.260 --> 30:00.860
So, twice in one day--
what, you wanted to come see

30:00.862 --> 30:03.597
where us gung-ho cowboys work?
Look, about that,

30:03.599 --> 30:05.498
I'm sorry I couldn't
get your warrant.

30:05.500 --> 30:07.600
Especially after
everything you did for me.

30:07.602 --> 30:10.070
Aw, Ellie, you
don't owe me anything.

30:10.072 --> 30:12.072
Anyway, I-I thought
you should know,

30:12.074 --> 30:14.774
after I requested the warrant,
I got a bunch of calls.

30:14.776 --> 30:17.243
Apparently, Thomas
Farrow was active

30:17.245 --> 30:18.678
in local politics.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.713
He's donated money to half
the judges on the island.

30:20.715 --> 30:22.782
Even worked on the
governor's campaign,

30:22.784 --> 30:25.151
- and was invited to the inauguration.
- Ah.

30:25.153 --> 30:27.554
Well, it's a good thing we
didn't do anything stupid, then.

30:27.556 --> 30:29.022
Seriously,

30:29.024 --> 30:32.959
if you're going to proceed,
you should tread carefully.

30:32.961 --> 30:34.727
Yeah, okay.
Thanks for the advice.

30:34.729 --> 30:36.529
Guess who hit the mother lode?
Jerry, hey,

30:36.531 --> 30:38.431
you remember
Deputy Prosecutor Clayton?

30:39.233 --> 30:41.501
Hey.
Hi.

30:41.503 --> 30:44.404
You were saying?

30:44.406 --> 30:45.738
Uh, yeah.

30:45.740 --> 30:46.773
Um...

30:46.775 --> 30:48.241
you know Area 51?

30:48.243 --> 30:49.309
Turns out

30:49.311 --> 30:50.476
there's an Area 52.

30:51.278 --> 30:52.945
Blows your mind, right?

30:55.048 --> 30:56.916
What did you do, Steve?

30:56.918 --> 31:00.753
Nothing you, uh, you would
want to know about.

31:05.592 --> 31:07.527
All right.

31:07.529 --> 31:09.695
I'll show myself out.

31:15.302 --> 31:16.569
What'd you find
on Farrow?

31:16.571 --> 31:18.137
Well, first of all--
spoiler alert--

31:18.139 --> 31:20.272
his name's not Farrow.

31:23.376 --> 31:24.862
<i>Mr. Weiss,</i>
<i>we need to ask you</i>

31:24.862 --> 31:27.046
a few questions.

31:27.048 --> 31:29.648
Henry Chun and Mark Lerner
are both dead.

31:29.650 --> 31:30.850
Ring a bell?

31:30.852 --> 31:32.985
Yeah, they were killed
by the same person

31:32.987 --> 31:34.320
who did this to you.

31:34.322 --> 31:36.489
We think it was someone
you went to high school with.

31:36.491 --> 31:38.090
Did you happen
to get a good look

31:38.092 --> 31:40.626
at your attacker's face?
No.

31:40.628 --> 31:43.862
He was wearing a mask--
but I know who it is.

31:43.864 --> 31:45.631
Sam Cole.

31:50.904 --> 31:54.006
This is all my fault.

31:54.008 --> 31:56.342
When we were seniors
in high school,

31:56.344 --> 31:59.244
we used to pick on Sam.

31:59.246 --> 32:01.713
But I took it too far.

32:01.715 --> 32:03.215
What happened?

32:03.217 --> 32:04.783
That movie came out--
<i> Jack Knife.</i>

32:04.785 --> 32:07.219
I thought it'd be funny
if we string Sam up

32:07.221 --> 32:10.122
like a scarecrow,
you know, like in the movie.

32:12.125 --> 32:16.628
Henry and Mark said no, but I
talked them into it, and...

32:16.630 --> 32:19.131
so we beat him up and...
took his clothes

32:19.133 --> 32:21.733
and... left him there all night.

32:23.369 --> 32:25.337
When we
took him down

32:25.339 --> 32:28.740
in the morning,
he was still crying, and...

32:28.742 --> 32:32.244
I said we'd kill him if he
told anybody, and he never did.

32:32.246 --> 32:35.547
When was the last time
you saw him?

32:37.083 --> 32:39.251
Couple of years ago.

32:39.253 --> 32:41.586
I go to get gas,
he's working the register,

32:41.588 --> 32:43.822
and we do that thing
where you pretend

32:43.824 --> 32:46.558
like you don't know each other.

32:46.560 --> 32:49.661
When he took my money,
his hand was shaking.

32:49.663 --> 32:51.029
Well, see, nobody
goes through

32:51.031 --> 32:54.666
something like that
without getting scars.

32:56.168 --> 32:59.070
I was just a stupid kid.

32:59.072 --> 33:01.573
I got an address on Cole.

33:03.043 --> 33:05.977
Good news.

33:05.979 --> 33:09.280
Looks like you're gonna
be going home soon. Ah.

33:09.282 --> 33:11.382
Glad you've finally come
to your senses.

33:11.384 --> 33:13.184
No apology necessary.

33:13.186 --> 33:15.186
That's big of you.

33:15.188 --> 33:17.722
Anyway, after we process
your extradition order,

33:17.724 --> 33:19.457
we'll hand you over
to the British government

33:19.459 --> 33:21.259
in a couple hours, okay?

33:22.895 --> 33:25.563
Major William Corrigan,
right?

33:25.565 --> 33:28.566
Former British Special Forces,
court-martialed

33:28.568 --> 33:30.868
in 2004 for excessive force

33:30.870 --> 33:32.637
in combat, never showed up
for the trial;

33:32.639 --> 33:33.639
instead,
you disappeared.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.807
And, uh, here you are,

33:35.809 --> 33:37.542
living in Hawaii
under a false identity,

33:37.544 --> 33:39.677
and counterfeiting money
to stay afloat.

33:39.679 --> 33:41.712
Bravo, Commander.

33:41.714 --> 33:43.481
You're a murderer.

33:43.483 --> 33:47.018
Five innocent Iraqis died as
a direct result of your orders.

33:47.020 --> 33:48.819
I'm a soldier.
No, you're not.

33:48.821 --> 33:50.922
You gave up that privilege
when you crossed the line.

33:50.924 --> 33:51.989
What line?

33:51.991 --> 33:52.890
Warfare's messy.

33:52.892 --> 33:54.825
It lives in the gray.
Always has.

33:56.828 --> 34:01.032
My team had just cleared out
a village of insurgents.

34:01.034 --> 34:03.334
As our convoy was leaving,

34:03.336 --> 34:05.169
I spotted
a hatchback approaching,

34:05.171 --> 34:06.504
wrong side of the road.

34:06.506 --> 34:08.839
100 meters out,
I had a decision to make.

34:08.841 --> 34:10.708
So you lit it up, huh?

34:10.710 --> 34:12.810
A mother and her four kids.

34:12.812 --> 34:15.045
I wasn't taking any chances
with my men.

34:15.047 --> 34:16.580
You didn't even fire
a warning shot.

34:16.581 --> 34:17.947
You've led men
in battle.

34:17.949 --> 34:21.585
You know how it is--
you hesitate, they die.

34:21.587 --> 34:23.786
Was there collateral? Sure.

34:23.789 --> 34:27.690
But all my boys
made it back that day.

34:27.693 --> 34:29.525
You never cared
about your men,

34:29.527 --> 34:32.563
Corrigan-- if you did, you
wouldn't have killed this guy.

34:32.565 --> 34:34.331
Lieutenant Colin Helms.

34:34.333 --> 34:36.900
What, was he collateral, too?

34:36.902 --> 34:38.768
What'd you do with his body?

34:40.905 --> 34:42.606
You're nothing but a coward.

34:42.608 --> 34:45.074
No.

34:45.077 --> 34:47.043
The cowards

34:47.045 --> 34:50.347
are the politicians
who send us into battle,

34:50.349 --> 34:52.049
second-guess every decision

34:52.051 --> 34:54.150
we make.

34:54.152 --> 34:57.054
It's never their blood
that's spilled though, is it?

35:05.496 --> 35:07.964
What do you got?

35:07.966 --> 35:12.135
Okay, CSU found blood trace
in Farrow's living room.

35:12.137 --> 35:13.137
Corrigan's living room.

35:13.138 --> 35:14.771
What?

35:14.773 --> 35:16.239
Farrow is Corrigan.
Corrigan is Farrow.

35:16.241 --> 35:18.875
You know what I mean.
Just-just get to the good part.

35:18.877 --> 35:20.277
Thank you.

35:20.279 --> 35:21.945
Anyway, it's not blood, okay?

35:21.947 --> 35:24.147
They ran tests. It's not blood.
It's, uh... it's corn syrup,

35:24.149 --> 35:26.383
red food coloring
and flour.

35:26.385 --> 35:28.518
They faked Helms's murder.
Mmm.

35:30.155 --> 35:32.122
All right, this was
Corrigan's plan all along.

35:32.124 --> 35:34.224
Right? Releasing Jerry,
the deal with the German.

35:34.226 --> 35:36.393
<i>He wanted us to focus on him</i>

35:36.395 --> 35:39.863
<i>so Helms was free</i>
<i> to move that cash.</i>

35:44.368 --> 35:46.236
<i>You got to hand it to the guy.</i>

35:46.238 --> 35:49.072
As far as distractions go, he's right
up there with Hans and Simon Gruber.

35:49.074 --> 35:50.240
We gotta find Helms

35:50.242 --> 35:52.475
<i>before he makes that deal.</i>

36:55.421 --> 36:57.220
Drop your weapon!

36:58.056 --> 37:00.991
Hands in the air.
Drop your weapon.

37:05.329 --> 37:08.098
Where's your father, Aaron?

37:15.039 --> 37:17.374
When I came home with this,

37:17.376 --> 37:18.842
he told me the story.

37:18.844 --> 37:21.544
I always knew
he was weak.

37:21.546 --> 37:22.879
Pathetic.

37:22.881 --> 37:25.282
Finally understood why.

37:25.284 --> 37:27.183
What did you do to your father?

37:27.185 --> 37:29.019
<i> He's where he belongs.</i>

37:29.021 --> 37:31.488
<i> Aaron, what did you do?</i>

37:31.490 --> 37:33.022
<i> My father was smart.</i>

37:33.024 --> 37:35.959
He could've done something
with his life.

37:35.961 --> 37:38.795
Before they ruined it.

37:38.797 --> 37:40.697
And mine, too.

37:48.472 --> 37:53.209
Look around.
At school, I'm the poor kid.

37:53.211 --> 37:55.511
The one they laugh at.

37:56.413 --> 37:59.682
This is
what those guys did to me.

37:59.684 --> 38:02.685
Hey... this is not like
the movies.

38:02.687 --> 38:05.054
If I shoot you,
it won't be in the shoulder.

38:06.090 --> 38:07.023
It'll be one shot.

38:07.025 --> 38:08.558
Center mass.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.059
You're dead.

38:13.530 --> 38:16.999
Now that's how you end
a horror movie.

38:17.001 --> 38:19.168
<i>Guys, I think I got something.</i>

38:19.170 --> 38:21.904
Take a look.

38:21.906 --> 38:23.206
According to British Intel,

38:23.208 --> 38:26.342
Helms has ties
to a radical IRA splinter group.

38:26.344 --> 38:28.411
The IRA?

38:28.413 --> 38:30.746
I thought they died with
the last Duran Duran album.

38:30.748 --> 38:33.049
Well, apparently,
they're making a comeback.

38:33.051 --> 38:34.750
New faces. Same ideology.

38:34.752 --> 38:35.985
The IRA.

38:35.987 --> 38:37.653
Not Duran Duran.
I got it.

38:37.655 --> 38:40.823
But check this out:
This freighter has been anchored

38:40.825 --> 38:42.658
four miles offshore.

38:42.660 --> 38:44.794
Hasn't moved in hours.

38:44.796 --> 38:46.195
Tag numbers

38:46.197 --> 38:49.198
show it being registered
out of Belfast, Ireland.

38:49.200 --> 38:53.369
Why is a former British soldier
doing business with the IRA?

38:54.437 --> 38:56.906
Corrigan thinks he was betrayed
by his own government.

38:56.908 --> 38:58.240
He's not counterfeiting
for profit.

38:58.242 --> 39:01.210
He's funding a war
against his own country.

39:16.559 --> 39:20.863
Commander McGarrett,
target is five kilometers away.

39:20.865 --> 39:22.131
<i>You are green to engage.</i>

39:22.133 --> 39:23.866
<i> Roger that.</i>

39:57.467 --> 39:58.500
Steve!

40:23.159 --> 40:24.793
Jerry was right.

40:24.795 --> 40:27.128
Yes, he was.

40:35.604 --> 40:37.538
Checkmate.

40:50.987 --> 40:52.854
Okay, now you can say,
"I told you so."

40:52.856 --> 40:54.522
Do I get a badge now?
No.

40:54.524 --> 40:57.024
Come on, we got a sweet
track record, you and I.

40:57.026 --> 40:58.760
We'll see.

41:31.126 --> 41:33.994
Eric Dickerson.
Yes.

41:33.996 --> 41:35.996
Huge fan.
Thank you.

41:35.998 --> 41:37.498
Huge fan.
Sir, you set

41:37.500 --> 41:40.100
the all-time single season rushing
record in your second year.

41:40.102 --> 41:41.902
I mean, that's...
it's insane.

41:41.904 --> 41:43.571
30 years, still holding up.

41:43.573 --> 41:45.406
A.P. came pretty close
two years ago though.

41:45.408 --> 41:47.474
You must have been
sweating that out.

41:47.476 --> 41:49.076
Nah. Would've been good
for the league, but--

41:49.078 --> 41:50.644
between me and you--
Yeah.

41:50.646 --> 41:52.112
I love my record.

41:52.114 --> 41:53.981
Awesome. That's awesome.

41:53.983 --> 41:55.983
Hey, uh, what brings you to the island?
The Ono.

41:55.985 --> 41:58.952
I come every fall for some fishing.
All right. I got to tell you,

41:58.954 --> 42:00.554
my buddy's a huge football fan.

42:00.556 --> 42:02.589
He's gonna be pretty jealous
when he learns that I met you.

42:02.591 --> 42:03.790
Let's take a picture
and rub it in.

42:03.792 --> 42:05.626
Really?
Yeah.

42:05.628 --> 42:07.327
Man, this is cool.

42:07.329 --> 42:08.896
All right.

42:08.898 --> 42:10.230
You ready?

42:14.802 --> 42:16.670
Eric Dickerson.

42:18.473 --> 42:20.240
You gotta be kidding me.

42:20.242 --> 42:22.009
Unbelievable.

42:30.017 --> 42:30.951
Nice technique.

42:30.953 --> 42:33.720
Casting is all
about finesse.

42:33.722 --> 42:35.021
You use brute force,

42:35.023 --> 42:37.791
like you did with yours,
you don't get as far.

42:37.793 --> 42:39.793
Where'd you learn how to fish?

42:39.795 --> 42:42.195
Every summer we'd visit family
in Australia.

42:42.197 --> 42:44.698
Dad would take me down
to Port Phillip Bay.

42:44.700 --> 42:47.167
We'd throw in a line
and sit there for hours,

42:47.169 --> 42:49.336
just me and him.

42:50.371 --> 42:51.371
Ooh!

42:51.373 --> 42:53.773
Whoa. Okay,
not too fast.

42:53.775 --> 42:55.809
You'll lose it.
Watch and learn, McGarrett.

43:00.414 --> 43:01.815
All right!
Look at that.

43:09.824 --> 43:11.457
Just like that, huh?

43:11.459 --> 43:14.460
What? You thought
I was all talk?

43:14.462 --> 43:16.996
No. I just...
you know, I just, uh,

43:16.998 --> 43:19.432
figured you'd be, like,
a catch-and-release-type gal.

43:19.434 --> 43:20.833
Soft on fish violence
and all that.

43:20.835 --> 43:22.869
Well, laugh it up.

43:22.871 --> 43:25.305
'Cause you're gonna gut it, cook
it and serve that fish to me

43:25.307 --> 43:26.706
with an ice-cold beer.

43:26.708 --> 43:29.609
Is that right?
Yep.

43:29.611 --> 43:31.844
Consider it your apology

43:31.846 --> 43:34.414
for going behind my
back on that warrant.

43:34.416 --> 43:36.682
Oh, right.

43:36.684 --> 43:38.584
That, uh... Okay.

43:38.586 --> 43:40.019
It's a deal.

43:40.021 --> 43:41.587
Now we're even.

43:41.589 --> 43:43.789
All right.
