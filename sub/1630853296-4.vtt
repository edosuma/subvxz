WEBVTT

00:10.635 --> 00:12.846
- Are you ready for us,
Mrs. Gogol?

00:16.808 --> 00:17.726
- Sure.

00:48.673 --> 00:51.718
- So our nation's capital.

00:51.801 --> 00:53.470
That's really exciting, sir.
- Yeah.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.096
- It's always been
a dream of mine

00:55.180 --> 00:56.431
to see Abraham Lincoln's hat
at the Smithsonian.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.766
- Yeah.
- Do you think you

00:57.849 --> 00:58.975
and Mrs. Gogol
will have time to--

00:59.058 --> 01:01.561
- To look at a hat?
No.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.023
About the whole
Herbert situation.

01:05.106 --> 01:07.609
- The whole Herbert situation?
- I feel terrib--

01:07.692 --> 01:10.278
- Wow.
You look--

01:11.988 --> 01:14.240
- Like I took a shower?
- I was gonna say like my wife,

01:14.324 --> 01:17.118
but I just mean to say you--

01:17.202 --> 01:19.913
you still manage
to take my breath away.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.289
- Shall we?

01:21.372 --> 01:23.041
- You look awesome, Mrs. G.
- Okay, that--

01:34.344 --> 01:35.845
- Hey.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.138
Bon voyage, sir.

01:40.725 --> 01:43.478
- Bennett, will you
keep an eye on my dad?

01:45.230 --> 01:46.231
While I'm gone?

01:46.314 --> 01:47.607
- You can count on me, Mrs. G.

01:47.690 --> 01:48.733
Nothing to worry about.

01:51.402 --> 01:54.948
- I got the need for speed,
Diane!

01:55.031 --> 01:57.200
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:58.451 --> 01:59.828
Diane, can you see his cards

01:59.911 --> 02:00.870
from where you standing?

02:03.248 --> 02:07.085
This is fun, right?

02:07.168 --> 02:08.419
How you doing down there?

02:23.601 --> 02:26.354
- You again.

02:26.437 --> 02:29.858
- I--I can't tell if
that's a--a good or bad thing.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.234
I--I can't read your face.

02:31.317 --> 02:33.903
- It's good.
This is me smiling.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.365
- What's wrong?

02:37.448 --> 02:39.450
I can tell you're a bit
on edge today.

02:39.534 --> 02:40.368
- Really?

02:40.451 --> 02:41.703
I mean, we barely just met

02:41.786 --> 02:42.912
and you think you know me
like that?

02:42.996 --> 02:44.873
- Yes, actually.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.834
Human emotion
is simple to diagnose.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.752
- Yeah,
people usually can't read me,

02:49.836 --> 02:52.380
but I know you're smart.

02:52.463 --> 02:54.424
I heard
you helped Hazel escape.

02:54.507 --> 02:55.967
- Oh?

02:56.050 --> 02:58.720
I wonder which little
birdie told you that.

02:58.803 --> 03:01.389
Are you already looking
for a way out?

03:01.472 --> 03:03.558
I guess I shouldn't
get too attached.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.602
- No, no.
I'm--

03:05.685 --> 03:07.979
I'm--I'm here for--

03:08.062 --> 03:09.856
for life.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.609
I--I bet you miss Fiffany,
though.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.111
Why do you think she left
the Hub all of a sudden?

03:15.194 --> 03:17.989
- Mm.
That's Byron's version.

03:20.992 --> 03:24.162
- Um...
what's your version?

03:24.245 --> 03:25.872
- You're asking
a lot of questions

03:25.955 --> 03:27.916
for a man who hasn't even
offered me a drink.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.253
- You know, part of the reason
I came to the Hub

03:32.337 --> 03:34.339
is because there's no rain.

03:34.422 --> 03:37.091
Of course, Byron put it in
just to torture us,

03:37.175 --> 03:39.260
the sick fuck.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.678
- Some people like the rain.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.181
- Would you like to add
the father's name

03:43.264 --> 03:44.265
to the birth certificate?

03:46.935 --> 03:48.478
- There's no father.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.563
- God, what is with you?

03:50.647 --> 03:53.316
- Hunger, sleep deprivation,

03:53.399 --> 03:54.943
psychological warfare.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.737
-Yeah.
Yeah, sure, okay.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.447
For the last few days,
you've been all about

03:59.530 --> 04:02.659
finding clues
and seeking exits.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.620
Now you're just sad?
Come on.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.288
What's on your mind?

04:07.372 --> 04:11.960
- I still don't know
who sold me out to Byron.

04:12.043 --> 04:14.462
Which double-crossing snake

04:14.545 --> 04:17.632
is the reason that I'm here
in the pasture cube?

04:19.717 --> 04:22.637
Do you think it was Bennett?

04:22.720 --> 04:25.348
- Bennett?
Oh, my God, Bennett.

04:25.431 --> 04:29.060
Yeah! That boot-licking
Howdy Doody doll weenie?

04:29.143 --> 04:30.228
Of course!

04:30.311 --> 04:31.729
You can't trust someone who--

04:31.813 --> 04:34.983
who smiles when
you're yelling at him.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.694
But listen,
we gotta keep going, okay?

04:37.777 --> 04:39.362
It's time
to bench mopey Fiffany.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.114
Come on.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.333
- Ooh.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.677
I'm Dawn Fairbanks.
I'm Gogol's media manager.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.470
Hi.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.599
So, uh, Byron has requested

05:08.683 --> 05:11.227
that you be seated next to him
at the hearing,

05:11.310 --> 05:13.312
so I'm here to prep you
so we can make sure

05:13.396 --> 05:17.316
that we are presenting Gogol
in the best light possible.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.360
- But they were--they said
I wouldn't be speaking.

05:19.444 --> 05:22.071
- Mm, yeah, no,
you will not be speaking.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.698
Don't speak, okay?

05:23.781 --> 05:25.658
What I'm saying is
your facial expressions,

05:25.742 --> 05:27.452
your body language,
your eye contact,

05:27.535 --> 05:29.537
all of that
will be speaking volumes.

05:30.788 --> 05:32.373
You know,
this is the first time

05:32.457 --> 05:35.752
that the public is seeing
Mrs. Byron Gogol in the flesh.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.295
So even when
they're watching him

05:37.378 --> 05:40.131
and they're watching
his handsome mouth move

05:40.214 --> 05:41.966
and listening to the words
he's saying,

05:42.050 --> 05:44.260
their eyes are always
gonna drift over to you.

05:44.343 --> 05:47.388
They're gonna be almost
constantly looking at just you.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.766
So we need to know that
in our brains.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.727
- What do you want me
to nonverbally do?

05:52.810 --> 05:54.771
- Great question.
Really great question.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.314
So what we're going for here

05:56.397 --> 05:59.525
is presenting you and Byron
as a united front.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.403
Okay? So anytime you're walking
with Byron, hold his hand.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.863
- I'm not holding his hand.

06:03.946 --> 06:05.531
- Come again with that?

06:07.950 --> 06:09.702
Okay.
Um...

06:09.786 --> 06:12.955
look, Hazel, that's actually
what we call in the business

06:13.039 --> 06:14.707
a non-negoshe, all right?

06:14.791 --> 06:18.294
It's critical, especially with
these first-time appearances,

06:18.377 --> 06:19.879
that you hold hands

06:19.962 --> 06:21.714
and you make sure
that he takes the lead.

06:21.798 --> 06:22.715
Okay?

06:22.799 --> 06:23.925
Okay.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.676
Seems like you're
kind of getting it.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.106
- Nice to meet you, Mrs. Gogol.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.691
Hazel, you're doing
a good thing here.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.485
You could be saving
a lot of lives.

06:45.738 --> 06:49.408
- It's not at all
how I pictured it.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.077
- D.C.?

06:51.160 --> 06:53.788
You've never been?

06:53.871 --> 06:55.665
- I've never been anywhere.

07:02.046 --> 07:06.300
- Byron Gogol is a cold-blooded
Illuminati reptile!

07:08.219 --> 07:10.680
- Mr. and Mrs. Gogol,
welcome to D.C.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.390
It's an honor
to have you at our hotel.

07:12.473 --> 07:14.433
- Yes. Thank you for having us.
- Once you're settled in,

07:14.517 --> 07:16.310
I'd like to go over
your itinerary for tomorrow,

07:16.394 --> 07:17.812
as well as the list
of attendees

07:17.895 --> 07:19.188
at General Restrepo's gala.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.648
- Great. Thank you.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.150
- Uh, will you be
needing reservations tonight

07:22.233 --> 07:23.609
or else be taking dinner
in your room?

07:23.693 --> 07:25.278
- Um, the room will be fine.

07:25.361 --> 07:29.490
- So MSNBC, CNN, Fox, and BBC
have requested interviews.

07:29.574 --> 07:32.243
- Yeah, uh, which one? No BBC.
- Right. Absolutely.

07:32.326 --> 07:33.494
Keep it national.

07:33.578 --> 07:34.662
Oh, and Oprah
called personally,

07:34.745 --> 07:35.997
but I said we'd circle back.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.456
- Uh, yeah, don't--
just leave her.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.833
- Copy that.
- This way?

07:38.916 --> 07:40.168
- Oh, right this way, sir.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.460
- Thank you.

07:41.544 --> 07:45.006
- Is it always like that?
All those people?

07:45.089 --> 07:46.340
- Yeah.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.676
Now you understand
why I never left the Hub.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.806
- I don't know.
I think it's kind of exciting.

07:55.725 --> 07:59.437
- Um, I--I--I--

07:59.520 --> 08:02.899
I got you your own room and I--

08:02.982 --> 08:04.192
unless you want to--
- Thank you.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.319
I'll take my own room.
- Okay.

08:06.402 --> 08:07.320
This one.

08:07.403 --> 08:08.738
- Yeah.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.158
- You look nice today.

08:12.241 --> 08:13.659
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.836
- You still watching the people
in the Hub?

08:23.920 --> 08:25.213
- No.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.672
Now, I'm watching us,

08:26.756 --> 08:28.758
I'm going through her memories.

08:30.509 --> 08:33.638
We were so awful to each other.

08:33.721 --> 08:36.557
- Well, that's them.
That's not us.

08:36.641 --> 08:37.892
- It doesn't seem fair that

08:37.975 --> 08:39.560
they get to be
in the real world.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.438
- Oh, we're the lucky ones.

08:42.521 --> 08:45.316
It's better to stay in here

08:45.399 --> 08:46.567
where everything's pure.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.569
- But shouldn't we be the ones

08:48.653 --> 08:50.905
that get
to live inside real bodies?

08:50.988 --> 08:52.198
That get to touch each other?

08:55.993 --> 08:58.287
We're the better version
of them.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.417
We actually love each other.

09:03.501 --> 09:04.752
- Yes.

09:04.835 --> 09:07.922
But in here,
everything will stay perfect.

09:08.005 --> 09:10.424
If we go out there,
anything could happen to us.

09:14.595 --> 09:17.223
- Are you saying...

09:17.306 --> 09:20.226
we could go out there?

09:23.187 --> 09:26.065
- Possibly.

09:26.148 --> 09:29.568
If we had bodies to enter.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.613
- I want this.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.116
I want to be alive.

10:08.357 --> 10:09.650
- All these people died
this year.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.777
We believe
these people are alive

10:11.861 --> 10:13.154
and working in the Hub.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.765
- What the hell?

10:40.848 --> 10:41.766
You a spy?

10:43.642 --> 10:47.188
I mean,
how'd you find this place?

10:47.271 --> 10:51.609
Did Ralph sneak you a map?

10:51.692 --> 10:52.860
Oh, God.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.237
I told that cocksucker,
no newbies.

10:56.655 --> 10:58.657
But I guess since you're here,

10:58.741 --> 11:00.993
welcome to the speakeasy!

11:01.077 --> 11:03.662
- Welcome.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.715
- Front desk.
- Hi.

11:14.799 --> 11:18.844
I need the number
for Hamilton Paints, please.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.763
- One moment.
I'll connect you.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.478
- Hello?
Hamilton Paints.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.941
- Hello?

11:32.024 --> 11:35.111
- Yeah. Can I help you?

11:35.194 --> 11:37.154
Yes.

11:37.238 --> 11:40.825
Uh, I'm--I'm looking for

11:40.908 --> 11:45.871
a certain color of paint.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.498
Grey Fox.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.044
Hello?

11:52.128 --> 11:53.170
- Thank you.

12:28.122 --> 12:30.916
- W-who is it?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.835
- It's--it's--it's Byron.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.882
Can you--
can you listen to my speech?

12:37.965 --> 12:39.383
And that's why I implore you,

12:39.467 --> 12:41.385
distinguished members
of Congress,

12:41.469 --> 12:43.888
to let Gogol Tech
guide humanity's path

12:43.971 --> 12:45.139
towards immortality.

12:45.222 --> 12:48.100
The future is safe
in our hands.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.438
What do you think?

12:55.524 --> 12:57.109
- Great.
- Well, thank you.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.361
Thank you
for listening to that.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.529
- Yep.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.449
That's great.

13:05.784 --> 13:06.911
Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.038
- Good night.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.507
- Hey, so listen,
I know you wear the clothes

13:19.590 --> 13:20.549
and everything,
but you do not

13:20.633 --> 13:22.051
have to play the part.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.719
Just tell me the truth.
That's all I'm asking.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.804
I know who you are now, okay?
I know the real you now.

13:25.888 --> 13:26.931
- Oh, yeah?

13:27.014 --> 13:27.973
- Yes, I do.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.433
And I'm asking the real you

13:29.517 --> 13:32.228
to just give me
an honest opinion.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.191
- It was boring.

13:37.274 --> 13:38.359
- Fuck.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.030
Okay.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.407
Well, uh, good.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.577
Can you, uh, explain why?

13:49.453 --> 13:52.581
- You're talking about
a posthuman future,

13:52.665 --> 13:55.417
which is a very intense thing
for regular people.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.211
And you say these things
like you're--

13:57.294 --> 14:00.506
you say that the human body
is "outdated and inefficient."

14:00.589 --> 14:02.383
- Yeah, well,
I--I think it--it--

14:02.466 --> 14:05.094
I don't think yours is,
just so you know. But it--

14:05.177 --> 14:09.014
- Did you see that poster today
that the protestor had?

14:09.098 --> 14:10.975
About you being
a cold-blooded Illuminati

14:11.058 --> 14:14.019
reptile in a skin suit?

14:16.480 --> 14:17.731
No, I didn't see--

14:17.815 --> 14:20.234
I didn't see that--the--
that poster.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.778
- You just stand there.

14:22.861 --> 14:24.071
You just stand there,

14:24.154 --> 14:26.198
rattling off data
and statistics.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.909
You're like a--
I don't know.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.369
You just don't connect.

14:30.452 --> 14:34.123
You don't connect emotionally
to any of it.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.416
You gotta make people
feel something

14:35.499 --> 14:37.167
if you want them
to do something.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.133
- Yeah.
You're--you're good at that.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.510
Yeah.
You're really good at that.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.346
I don't know how to do that,

14:49.430 --> 14:52.224
and I need...

14:55.728 --> 14:57.104
No.

14:57.187 --> 14:59.398
Can you help me?
Can you just help me genuinely?

14:59.481 --> 15:02.359
Like just help me fix it?

15:04.028 --> 15:05.154
- Okay.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.283
- Hey, I know you.

15:09.366 --> 15:12.286
Yeah.
You're--you're Oz Wimmer.

15:12.369 --> 15:15.080
I-I was a research assistant
at Cal Tech.

15:15.164 --> 15:18.167
- Really?
I have a photographic memory.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.627
I don't remember you.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.670
- I was just starting
when you, uh--

15:21.754 --> 15:22.630
- Died?

15:22.713 --> 15:23.881
- Right.
Yeah.

15:23.964 --> 15:26.091
- I hope you're thirsty, boys.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.762
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:32.306 --> 15:35.059
- Can I ask you guys something?
Just between us.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.727
- That's the code in here.

15:36.810 --> 15:39.938
We shall never speak of what
is spoken in the speakeasy.

15:40.022 --> 15:44.610
- Every job I've ever had,
someone's gotten fired or quit.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.654
No, but we're--we're "dead."

15:46.737 --> 15:49.323
We can't just go back out there
in the real world.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.992
So what happens in here

15:52.076 --> 15:54.078
if someone messes up

15:54.161 --> 15:56.872
or changes their mind?

16:02.628 --> 16:05.589
- Officially,
that's never happened.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.841
- Unofficially,
there was a rumor once

16:07.925 --> 16:10.177
about a guy who wanted out.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.554
Stopped cutting his hair,
stopped showing up for work,

16:12.638 --> 16:13.889
stopped bathing.

16:13.972 --> 16:16.100
- Allegedly,
they relocated him to Europe

16:16.183 --> 16:17.309
with a new identity.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.602
- Or not.

16:18.686 --> 16:19.603
- Hm.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.188
What about relationships?

16:21.271 --> 16:23.232
Is there any couples in here?
Any special ladies?

16:23.315 --> 16:24.817
- Bad idea.
- Okay.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.528
- If it goes south, you have
to see your ex every day

16:27.611 --> 16:28.946
for the rest of your life.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.656
- That's what our
virtual assistants are for.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.700
They provide companionship.
- The--

16:32.783 --> 16:34.535
- Yours hasn't
gotten you off yet?

16:34.618 --> 16:36.453
Just ask.
They're very thorough.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.455
- It's true.
- Double true.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.895
- Zelda?
You asleep?

17:04.398 --> 17:05.607
Asleep?

17:05.691 --> 17:07.484
- No.
I don't sleep much.

17:07.568 --> 17:08.777
- Ah.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.821
Well, if you're up
for a late-night chat,

17:10.904 --> 17:12.281
I could use the company.

17:12.364 --> 17:14.408
- Sure.
I'm up for it.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.118
- You might find it strange.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.121
Um...

17:22.124 --> 17:24.084
But...

17:24.168 --> 17:25.919
I haven't met anyone
in the Hub

17:26.003 --> 17:29.590
that feels...
like a real person.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.049
Except you.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.260
- I've never met anyone
like you, either.

17:33.343 --> 17:36.597
Why did you come to the Hub?
You're not like the others.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.433
- Well, it's the best place
in the world to work.

17:39.516 --> 17:42.269
- Please,
don't take me for a fool.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.354
I may be pretty,
but I'm not stupid.

17:44.438 --> 17:47.524
Why are you here?

17:47.608 --> 17:48.650
- I was born here.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.027
Do you have a girlfriend?

17:54.656 --> 17:57.785
Uh, I--well,
that came outta nowhere, so.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.536
- Not for me.

17:59.620 --> 18:00.954
I've been wondering.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.415
- Oh.
Wondering.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.836
No.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.048
No, I don't--I don't--
I don't do relationships.

18:11.131 --> 18:13.717
- Why not?

18:13.801 --> 18:15.969
- Uh, it's kinda hard
to explain,

18:16.053 --> 18:20.140
but I had to train myself
to not feel anything.

18:22.726 --> 18:26.980
And I kind of got too good it.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.527
- Good morning, everyone!

18:31.610 --> 18:33.695
- Right here! Over here!

18:33.779 --> 18:36.198
- I assume those seats
are saved for us.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.909
However, Gogol Tech
is no longer pursuing

18:38.992 --> 18:40.953
the Made for Love chip
as a relationship device.

18:41.036 --> 18:43.872
Instead, we are asking
for permission

18:43.956 --> 18:47.876
that our research may continue
in pursuit of a far nobler goal:

18:47.960 --> 18:51.505
the preservation
of consciousness after death.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.841
- I propose that
this topic falls far outside

18:53.924 --> 18:55.467
the purview of this committee.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.844
- Respectfully,

18:56.927 --> 18:58.595
this proposal involves
the same technology

18:58.679 --> 19:00.264
that this committee
already approved.

19:00.347 --> 19:02.599
- But in a far different
context.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.602
On a related note,
I'm eager to hear a response

19:05.686 --> 19:08.438
regarding a video
all over the internet

19:08.522 --> 19:11.441
that suggests
you already chipped your wife.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.362
I cannot give
every rumor oxygen.

19:15.445 --> 19:18.574
- I wasn't asking you.
The question is for your wife.

19:19.783 --> 19:23.287
Mrs. Gogol, is there any truth
to what that nun said?

19:23.370 --> 19:26.707
Did your husband violate you,

19:26.790 --> 19:30.878
put a chip in your head,
and kidnap you?

19:32.254 --> 19:34.423
- No.

19:34.506 --> 19:35.507
I--

19:37.885 --> 19:38.927
Um...

19:40.637 --> 19:42.097
I don't have a chip in my head.

19:44.975 --> 19:47.728
Sorry to disappoint
the tabloids.

19:47.811 --> 19:49.855
I know that'd make
a great story.

19:49.938 --> 19:53.150
- In--in 2017,
you and Mr. Gogol appeared

19:53.233 --> 19:56.987
in a promotional video
for the Made for Love chip.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.239
So you clearly endorse it.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.949
- No, I don't.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.036
- Well, then why are you here
supporting this research?

20:04.119 --> 20:05.454
- Revolutionary science
must start--

20:05.537 --> 20:06.872
- I know at first,
these things sound

20:06.955 --> 20:09.166
like they're out of
a horror movie.

20:09.249 --> 20:14.046
When Byron first said the word
"transhumanism" to me...

20:14.129 --> 20:16.757
I was very freaked out too.

20:16.840 --> 20:20.928
But I wanna tell you
about a 12-year-old girl

20:21.011 --> 20:23.597
who lost her mother to cancer

20:23.680 --> 20:26.058
and never got to say goodbye.

20:26.141 --> 20:29.269
This little girl had to enter
the most formative years

20:29.353 --> 20:34.399
of her life without
her mother's guidance or love.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.986
And if you were
to ask her today,

20:38.070 --> 20:40.113
a grown woman,

20:40.197 --> 20:44.117
if she could have anything
in the world, what would it be?

20:44.201 --> 20:47.496
She would say...

20:47.579 --> 20:51.833
to have one more conversation--

20:53.251 --> 20:54.628
With her mom.

20:57.547 --> 21:00.300
And I can't help
but be personally invested

21:00.384 --> 21:02.636
in this research because

21:02.719 --> 21:04.972
that 12-year-old girl...

21:05.055 --> 21:07.140
was me.

21:09.476 --> 21:12.729
So I do support this technology

21:12.813 --> 21:14.856
because it could lead
to a future

21:14.940 --> 21:19.528
where we don't ever have
to lose the ones that we love.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.246
- Have you seen
what they're saying online?

21:29.329 --> 21:31.748
People are obsessed
with Mrs. Gogol.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.125
Move over, Byron.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.002
- Have you thought about
running for office?

21:35.085 --> 21:37.212
- Oh, uh, no.

21:37.295 --> 21:38.296
But maybe I will now.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.215
I--I--I love kissing babies.

21:42.592 --> 21:43.760
- This is our host.

21:43.844 --> 21:46.138
General Restrepo,
please meet Hazel.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.389
- Mm.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.891
Finally, you let Rapunzel
out of the tower.

21:51.768 --> 21:54.021
I can see why you call her
your secret weapon.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.856
- Oh.
- Ah.

21:55.939 --> 21:59.943
- Can I borrow your husband
for a boring work chat

22:00.027 --> 22:01.403
so you can have some fun?

22:01.486 --> 22:03.071
- Uh-oh.
She's letting me off-leash.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.491
- Nils, meet Hazel.

22:06.575 --> 22:09.494
- You were captivating
at the hearing today.

22:10.537 --> 22:11.747
- Oh, thank you.

22:14.458 --> 22:17.711
- Tell me, Byron,
do you believe in angels?

22:17.794 --> 22:20.130
- I never really
thought about it, actually.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.548
- Isn't he beautiful?

22:21.631 --> 22:24.009
Little, fat baby with wings.

22:24.092 --> 22:26.762
For display, though,
I cover his baby penis.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.180
- This what you wanted
to show me?

22:29.806 --> 22:31.183
- Someone's impatient.

22:32.934 --> 22:34.728
The conscious transfer
you spoke of today,

22:34.811 --> 22:36.271
it's possible?
- Yes.

22:36.354 --> 22:37.814
I copied human consciousness

22:37.898 --> 22:39.149
to a chip and uploaded it.

22:39.232 --> 22:40.400
Twice, actually.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.235
- What happens
if I upload my mind

22:42.319 --> 22:44.404
onto a chip
and put it in his brain?

22:44.488 --> 22:47.282
Does my consciousness
cockblock his consciousness?

22:47.365 --> 22:50.077
- So to speak, yes, it would.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.328
It would render him suppressed,

22:51.411 --> 22:53.497
but he'd still be alive
and we--

22:53.580 --> 22:54.998
- I have a proposal.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.510
- You wanna use death row
inmates as a test population?

23:06.593 --> 23:09.387
- Why execute perfectly
healthy, fit,

23:09.471 --> 23:11.264
tight, beautiful bodies

23:11.348 --> 23:12.766
when we can replace
their consciousness

23:12.849 --> 23:15.394
with a more...
cooperative one?

23:15.477 --> 23:19.106
If all goes well,
maybe I replace my whole staff.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.359
Just kidding.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.611
- This would give us
a trial data set.

23:24.694 --> 23:25.654
- Mm-hmm.

23:25.737 --> 23:26.947
I can even get a new husband

23:27.030 --> 23:28.281
while I'm at it.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.200
Since you're not available.

23:30.283 --> 23:32.661
- Unless--

23:32.744 --> 23:34.538
- I'll have to discuss it
with Hazel.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.751
You need your wife's permission
to make deals?

23:39.835 --> 23:42.629
Does she lay your panties out
for you in the morning too?

23:46.174 --> 23:47.467
- I'll think about it.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.970
I must get back to the party,
General.

23:50.053 --> 23:51.054
Excuse me.

24:15.537 --> 24:18.498
- I'm practicing being her.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.667
For when we're out
in the real world.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.086
- Maybe we should think
about this more.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.005
I don't want you to change

24:25.088 --> 24:26.506
and I don't want us to change.

24:34.681 --> 24:36.183
- That's my dad.

24:39.853 --> 24:42.439
That's my dad.

24:42.522 --> 24:45.108
Byron!

24:45.192 --> 24:47.694
He can help us.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.905
We can become real.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.206
- Excuse me.

25:06.213 --> 25:07.505
- Ooh. That's so hot.

25:08.798 --> 25:10.550
- Mrs. Gogol?

25:10.634 --> 25:11.885
- Mm?

25:11.968 --> 25:13.678
- I saw you didn't
have a drink.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.472
Cheers.

25:15.555 --> 25:16.681
Oh, don't worry.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.225
Nothing in there
besides champagne.

25:18.308 --> 25:19.309
- Okay.

25:19.392 --> 25:20.977
- Mm.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.896
Congratulations.

25:22.979 --> 25:25.774
It was amazing.

25:25.857 --> 25:28.109
Mysterious shut-in to

25:28.193 --> 25:29.569
America's sweetheart.

25:29.653 --> 25:31.863
That really was
quite the performance today.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.241
- It wasn't a performance.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.159
Good. That's very good.
Good. Yes.

25:36.243 --> 25:37.577
You're a real pro.
That's very good.

25:37.661 --> 25:39.537
I should head back inside.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.206
The--

25:41.289 --> 25:42.916
um...

25:42.999 --> 25:45.627
- It's really
a beautiful ring you have.

25:45.710 --> 25:48.546
Just close your hand.
That's right.

25:48.630 --> 25:51.841
It's for Jasper.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.343
Thanks for making the call.
- Mm-hmm.

25:53.426 --> 25:55.637
- How is Jasper?
Is he all right?

25:57.180 --> 25:58.348
- He's good.

25:58.431 --> 26:00.225
I think so.

26:00.308 --> 26:02.102
- Any suspicion from Byron?

26:02.185 --> 26:04.562
Um, no.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.106
Good.

26:08.525 --> 26:09.985
- I don't know--

26:10.068 --> 26:11.486
- What I've placed in your hand
is a tracking device

26:11.569 --> 26:13.196
meant to look like
a lady's lip balm.

26:13.280 --> 26:17.284
You get that to Jasper,
he'll know how to turn it on.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.786
- What--what happens
once it's turned on?

26:19.869 --> 26:22.872
- It'll get us
the exact location of the Hub.

26:22.956 --> 26:25.834
- Okay.
And then what?

26:25.917 --> 26:27.085
- That's it.

26:27.168 --> 26:28.878
We storm the castle,
and you end up

26:28.962 --> 26:30.297
being the hero
who took down Byron Gogol.

26:30.380 --> 26:33.591
- Okay.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.385
I don't have any pockets.

26:35.468 --> 26:37.304
Where do I put it?

26:39.222 --> 26:40.724
- Put in your bra.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.485
Would you have slept
with Jasper in Twin Sands?

26:52.569 --> 26:53.611
- What?
- No, nothing.

26:53.695 --> 26:55.363
Good night, Mrs. Gogol.

27:00.535 --> 27:02.704
- Mrs. Gogol?

27:02.787 --> 27:05.040
Your speech tonight
was incredibly moving.

27:05.123 --> 27:07.167
You and Byron
make quite a team.

27:07.250 --> 27:10.337
- Oh, thank you so much.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.380
- Mind if I steal my wife
for a second?

27:12.464 --> 27:14.090
- Of course.

27:14.174 --> 27:15.258
- May I?

27:15.342 --> 27:16.426
- Mm-hmm.

27:25.685 --> 27:28.355
- You were amazing today.

27:28.438 --> 27:29.856
Thank you.

27:34.778 --> 27:38.656
- I never realized how proud
I'd feel...

27:38.740 --> 27:41.076
being out in the world

27:41.159 --> 27:42.952
as your husband.

27:46.122 --> 27:47.624
Thank you.

27:49.125 --> 27:50.543
Thank you.

27:53.129 --> 27:55.882
- That was really fun tonight.
- Yeah.

27:55.965 --> 27:57.717
- Were you--
- Good night.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.386
- I think that's--

27:59.469 --> 28:01.429
that's my room.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.931
- Oh, my God.

28:03.014 --> 28:04.557
I'm a little drunk.
- It's okay.

28:07.769 --> 28:08.812
Oh.

28:08.895 --> 28:10.146
- I got it.
Here.

28:10.230 --> 28:11.898
Here you go.

28:11.981 --> 28:13.983
You've gotta move, probably--

28:31.126 --> 28:33.586
Sorry.

28:33.670 --> 28:34.796
I'm sorry.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.339
- No, no, I...

28:38.341 --> 28:41.094
don't wanna rush anything.

28:41.177 --> 28:42.345
- Yeah.

28:43.304 --> 28:44.431
- There you go.

28:44.514 --> 28:46.349
Yeah.
Okay.

28:52.689 --> 28:53.982
Good night.
- Night.
