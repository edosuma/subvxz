WEBVTT

00:07.808 --> 00:10.211
- Cherry, Kelsey, I asked
my parents if I could go

00:10.311 --> 00:11.512
to the new dance club
this week with you guys.

00:11.612 --> 00:12.846
And at first they weren't
sure, but then they said yeah.

00:12.946 --> 00:14.515
- ALL: Yeah.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.250
- Hey!

00:16.350 --> 00:19.487
No squealing in the halls.

00:19.587 --> 00:20.788
- Sorry, Principal Bradford.

00:20.888 --> 00:22.456
We're just really excited
because our parents

00:22.556 --> 00:25.159
are letting us go to that new
teen dance club this weekend.

00:25.259 --> 00:25.993
- It's called club--

00:26.094 --> 00:27.561
- ALL: * Ooh Ooh

00:27.661 --> 00:28.696
- [laughs]

00:28.796 --> 00:33.334
Oops, I must be
wearing my talk-to-me face.

00:33.434 --> 00:36.170
Don't talk to me.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.171
- I can't wait.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.039
Our first real dance club.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.742
- Can I get celebratory
girlfriends?

00:41.842 --> 00:45.213
- ALL: * Girlfriends

00:45.313 --> 00:46.480
- You look happy.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.116
What did you do?

00:48.216 --> 00:50.218
- You know me, Phoebs, always
trying to spice up

00:50.318 --> 00:51.252
someone's day.

00:51.352 --> 00:52.520
- Woooo!

00:52.620 --> 00:53.921
Hot, hot, hot!

00:54.021 --> 00:57.057
This chimichanga's
stuffed with fire!

00:57.158 --> 01:01.028
- Jalapeno.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.796
- Hot sauce fountain.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.732
[crying]

01:04.832 --> 01:09.670
- Who would do such a thing?

01:09.770 --> 01:14.675
- Who put superglue on
the hot sauce fountain?

01:14.775 --> 01:16.277
- You again, girlfriend?

01:16.377 --> 01:18.479
- You got it.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.815
Quick, get some water
from the bathroom?

01:21.915 --> 01:25.919
- [mariachi band playing]

01:31.659 --> 01:34.162
- * What you see is
not what you get *

01:34.228 --> 01:37.365
* Living our lives
with a secret *

01:37.465 --> 01:40.634
* We fit right in, bet
you'd never guess *

01:40.734 --> 01:43.904
* Because we're living our
lives just like all the rest *

01:44.004 --> 01:47.608
* A picture-perfect family
is what we try to be *

01:47.708 --> 01:50.878
* But closer you might see
the crazy things we do *

01:50.978 --> 01:52.380
* This isn't make-believe

01:52.480 --> 01:53.914
* It's our reality

01:54.014 --> 01:56.984
* Just your average family
trying to be normal *

01:57.084 --> 01:58.619
* And stay out of trouble

01:58.719 --> 02:01.889
* Living a double life *

02:07.094 --> 02:11.732
Remember, there are no small
pranks, only small people.

02:11.832 --> 02:15.236
Hey--hey, Principal Bradford,
I was just talking about ya.

02:15.336 --> 02:19.407
- I used to be able to talk.

02:19.507 --> 02:22.410
- "Public school enemy
number one, Max Thunderman."

02:22.510 --> 02:26.046
Hmm, hard work does pay off.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.581
- I know you did this, Max.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.251
I don't have proof, but I
promise you I'll find it

02:30.351 --> 02:32.620
before the blisters
on my throat heal.

02:37.124 --> 02:40.428
- Whoa, nerd wall.

02:40.528 --> 02:43.997
Can you guys move?

02:44.097 --> 02:46.234
Meant away from me.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.935
- That prank you pulled on
the principal was amazing.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.070
The whole school's
talking about it.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.340
- Ah, so you're fans, huh?

02:52.440 --> 02:53.674
Who do I make this out to?

02:53.774 --> 02:54.508
- It's Tom.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.709
- There you go, Tim.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.545
- You hear that,
guys, I'm Tim now?

02:57.645 --> 02:59.480
- Mr. Prank King, wait.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.350
- We were wondering if you
could teach us your pranky ways.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.652
- Guys, pranking isn't
something you can learn.

03:04.752 --> 03:05.486
You either got it--

03:05.586 --> 03:06.320
- We'll pay you.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.588
- --or you got money.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.357
- We'll do whatever you say.

03:09.457 --> 03:11.892
- Hmm, I will need minions if
I'm gonna take over

03:11.992 --> 03:13.394
the world someday.

03:13.494 --> 03:14.395
- You mean the school?

03:14.495 --> 03:16.096
- Yeah, that.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.131
All right, let's get started.

03:18.266 --> 03:23.304
Right after we get this
smudge off Lionel's shirt.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.538
- We just started, didn't we?

03:24.638 --> 03:26.073
- Yep.

03:29.142 --> 03:29.710
- Look who it is?

03:29.810 --> 03:32.313
My favorite people.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.982
- Are there two
Channing Tatum's behind us?

03:35.082 --> 03:39.420
- Yeah, I think she means us,
but I'm gonna check anyway.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.054
- I can't wait
for this weekend.

03:41.154 --> 03:45.293
Thank you so much for letting
me go to Club Ooh Ooh.

03:45.393 --> 03:46.794
- Uh, you've been doing a great
job with school, you deserve

03:46.894 --> 03:51.131
to dance the night
away at Club Ew-ew.

03:51.299 --> 03:53.734
- No, Hank, it's Oooh-ooh.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.636
- Oahhh, oahhh.

03:55.736 --> 03:56.904
- Oah.
- Boh.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.806
- Stop that.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.309
- Anyway, my friends
and I are so excited.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.511
We're getting our hair done,
getting our nails done.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.613
- Getting our chores done.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.315
- Oh, yeah, not a problem.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.516
- Before you go to the club.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.951
- Uh, yeah, that's a problem.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.119
- Phoebe, your choirs
have been piling up,

04:12.219 --> 04:14.021
and you promised you'd do them.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.393
- But there's
a bazillion things on here.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.462
I won't have time to get
clubbed up with my friends.

04:21.562 --> 04:24.765
- Oh, welcome to
Club Not Our Problem.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.634
Here's your VIP pass.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.939
- All right, if I just don't
sleep and have breakfast

04:32.039 --> 04:35.676
in the shower, I can get this
done before the weekend.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.011
Double sided?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.347
- COMPUTER: Alert, alert.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.482
Max and non-supes approaching.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.390
- Check it out, Tom, that girl
you stare at in math is here.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.959
- Shut up, Lionel.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.827
- Hey, I said no dweeb chatter.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.396
Now get downstairs.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.467
- What are those
guys doing here?

04:59.567 --> 05:00.934
- They're my new minions.

05:01.034 --> 05:04.572
I'm going to mold them in my
image and take over the world.

05:04.672 --> 05:08.175
Or at least buy cool
stuff with their money.

05:08.275 --> 05:09.209
- How does he get minions?

05:09.377 --> 05:10.110
I'm the one with choirs.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.379
I want minions.

05:11.479 --> 05:12.446
- BILLY: I'm gonna
get you, Nora.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.781
- NORA: Ah.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.016
- Hello, minions.

05:16.116 --> 05:20.020
- You'll never catch me.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.623
- You were saying.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.692
- Billy, Nora, how would you
guys like to get

05:24.792 --> 05:26.159
real superhero training?

05:26.259 --> 05:27.127
- Really?

05:27.227 --> 05:28.128
- I could use it.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.730
Billy just outsmarted me.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.500
Billy.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.801
- It'll be great.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.869
When I was your age, dad used
some pretty fun exercises

05:35.969 --> 05:37.538
to make me a better superhero.

05:37.638 --> 05:40.173
What are you guys,
like six and eight?

05:40.273 --> 05:44.144
- We're 9 and 11.

05:44.244 --> 05:47.247
- Wow, you guys are way behind.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.315
- I don't wanna fall behind.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.182
Train me first.

05:49.282 --> 05:50.250
- No, me first!

05:50.418 --> 05:53.554
- Easy, minions--I
mean, students.

05:53.654 --> 05:54.955
You guys can train together.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.958
It'll be a lot more work for
me, but you guys are worth it.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.730
- Max-imize yourself.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.765
Only way to become the best
prankster you can be is

06:04.865 --> 06:09.102
to stop being you and become me!

06:09.202 --> 06:10.438
Any questions so far?

06:10.471 --> 06:12.072
- Um, sir, why do you
wear a microphone

06:12.172 --> 06:13.240
when you're right next to us?

06:13.340 --> 06:14.808
- [echoes] Impact!

06:14.908 --> 06:19.312
- [feedback buzzes]

06:19.447 --> 06:20.914
- All right, MAX.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.015
M--mindlessly heed Max.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.250
A--aspire to be Max.

06:23.350 --> 06:26.319
X--exactly like Max.

06:26.454 --> 06:27.621
- Exactly begins with an E.

06:27.721 --> 06:31.792
- I said "mindlessly heed Max"!

06:31.892 --> 06:33.794
All right, we'll start prank
lessons tomorrow,

06:33.894 --> 06:35.696
but first homework.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.098
- Yes!

06:38.198 --> 06:40.534
- Tonight, you'll all have
to watch my DVD

06:40.634 --> 06:43.871
"Pranky Max Thunderman,
You're Welcome."

06:43.971 --> 06:45.673
You owe me $12.95 each.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.174
- We gave you all our cash.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.476
- Do you take credit cards?

06:48.576 --> 06:49.810
- Yes.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.912
But I don't give them back.

06:54.482 --> 06:57.485
- Behold my superhero
training dojo.

06:57.551 --> 07:01.354
- That's weird, because
dad calls this the yard.

07:01.489 --> 07:04.224
- It's actually the location
for our level one training.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.193
- BOTH: Oh.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.128
- Now today we'll be battling
the hedges

07:08.228 --> 07:09.797
and imprisoning the leaves.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.264
Here are your weapons.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.501
- Cool, giant scissors.

07:13.601 --> 07:17.705
Can't wait to run
with these babies.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.841
- And we're switching.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.209
- Aren't these
just garden tools?

07:22.309 --> 07:23.744
- Ah, maybe to
the untrained eye.

07:23.844 --> 07:27.748
But to an advanced superhero,
they're what I said earlier.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.117
You do wanna be an advanced
superhero, don't you?

07:30.217 --> 07:30.851
- I do.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.586
- Me, too.

07:32.686 --> 07:35.756
- Okay, now these will help
with your hand-eye coordination.

07:35.856 --> 07:39.660
And this will help with your
strength and rake-icity.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.930
- I'm gonna rake
this city clean.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.197
- All right, you
guys keep training.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.968
I gotta get to the nail
salon--library,

07:48.068 --> 07:50.070
to plan your next lesson.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.939
Quick, the leaves are escaping!

07:56.109 --> 07:58.612
- [bell rings]

07:58.712 --> 08:02.883
- All right, come on, guys.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.318
Okay, Tom, when Bradford
comes around that corner--

08:05.418 --> 08:08.689
- Hold on, you didn't say we
were pranking the principal.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.558
- Lionel, if you
wanna be the best,

08:10.624 --> 08:13.060
you gotta take on the top dog.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.895
Or if you want to
quit, that's fine, too.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.697
Just gotta pay the quitting fee.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.065
- No, no, I'm not quitting.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.467
I can't afford to quit.

08:20.568 --> 08:21.735
- Now that's
the right attitude.

08:21.835 --> 08:27.107
Tom, got your pie,
let him have it.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.576
- Let him have it.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.844
Got it.

08:30.944 --> 08:34.447
Principal Bradford, here you go.

08:34.582 --> 08:38.852
- Thanks.

08:38.952 --> 08:39.920
- I nailed him.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.923
His appetite's so
ruined for dinner.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.057
- Tom?

08:44.157 --> 08:45.593
- Yeah?

08:48.929 --> 08:54.602
- Oh, now I get it.

08:54.635 --> 08:55.903
- Guys, we're gonna work on
this all day

08:56.003 --> 08:57.304
until you get it right.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.006
Guy, we've worked all day, and
you haven't gotten

08:59.106 --> 09:02.342
anything right!

09:02.442 --> 09:04.277
Hey, better hope this prank
works, because

09:04.377 --> 09:07.748
I'm out of patience
and you're out of money.

09:07.848 --> 09:08.949
- We promise, it'll work.

09:09.049 --> 09:09.783
- [bell rings]

09:09.883 --> 09:10.784
- We did everything you said.

09:10.884 --> 09:11.619
- Here they come.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.621
Prank positions.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.423
- [screaming]

09:29.036 --> 09:30.003
- Nice job, guys.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.404
You make me smirk.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.273
Now come on, smirk with me.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.947
Ugh, you've ruined
smirking for me.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.382
Take a lap.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.017
Let's go, come on!

09:44.117 --> 09:45.152
- [whistle blows]

09:48.221 --> 09:49.289
- Hey, guys.

09:49.389 --> 09:52.259
- Whoa, Phoebe, great
job with the backyard.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.327
- Yeah, the car's
washed, you went shopping.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.097
It's like you have six hands.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.732
- Well, I don't,
that's impossible.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.167
Stop saying that.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.935
- Well, whatever you're doing,
keep it up

10:02.035 --> 10:04.872
and you'll be able to go
to Club Ooh Ooh.

10:04.972 --> 10:05.639
- Ah.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.507
- I've been practicing.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.878
- Hey, Phoebe, did you remember
to clean our bathrooms?

10:10.978 --> 10:12.512
- Looks like I did.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.319
[sighs]

10:19.419 --> 10:20.988
Geez, the couch is messy.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.323
I'll throw that one in for free.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.658
- Why can't Max
be more like her?

10:24.758 --> 10:27.728
- I know, right.

10:27.828 --> 10:28.896
- What was that?

10:28.996 --> 10:29.730
- A surprise attack.

10:29.830 --> 10:30.731
You guys did great.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.365
Your training's
totally paying off.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.401
- Like you said, if we can
handle dad's bathroom,

10:34.501 --> 10:37.304
we can handle any evil.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.372
- We saw things, Phoebe.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.609
- Tell me everything outside.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.611
Okay, maybe not everything.

10:50.383 --> 10:51.118
- Hey, guys.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.954
- Max, what a do?

10:54.054 --> 10:57.457
- Uh, hip slang, cool clothes.

10:57.557 --> 10:59.793
Looks like someone's
been watching my DVD.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.461
- You know it, son.

11:01.561 --> 11:04.932
- We watched that
DVD-eze for rea-eze.

11:05.032 --> 11:08.401
- The point is, we're
all fully Max-imized, bro.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.536
- Fully Max-imized?

11:09.636 --> 11:12.005
No, you can't be
fully Max-imized.

11:12.105 --> 11:15.408
Lionel's still got
something on his shirt.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.145
Uh, looks like the training
wheels have come off.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.346
- We learned from the best.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.982
Now just sit here in the chair
of honor and enjoy

11:22.082 --> 11:26.086
the new prank
we've been working on.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.520
- Nice chair.

11:27.620 --> 11:28.989
So where's this prank?

11:29.089 --> 11:30.991
- You're sitting
in it, top dog.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.760
- What's that now?

11:32.826 --> 11:33.961
Minions, no.

11:34.061 --> 11:37.998
Heed Max and command thee.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.000
You're going to regret this.

11:40.100 --> 11:45.538
No, no!

11:45.638 --> 11:46.874
Don't look at me.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.041
- [mariachi music playing]

11:48.141 --> 11:49.176
- Somebody stop this.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.343
No, oh, not the trash.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.079
Not the trash!

12:01.855 --> 12:02.790
- [music stops]

12:02.823 --> 12:04.291
- Students of Hiddenville High,

12:04.391 --> 12:06.794
say hello
to your new prank kings.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.862
- [cheering]

12:08.962 --> 12:11.799
- And say goodbye
to your old one.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.133
- Don't you dare.

12:13.233 --> 12:17.704
Don't you dare-e-e-e-e!

12:17.805 --> 12:18.605
- [crash]

12:18.705 --> 12:20.173
- Ooh.

12:26.479 --> 12:30.517
- Hey, what part of my
DVD did it say to prank me?

12:30.617 --> 12:31.919
- You were the one who said,

12:32.019 --> 12:33.887
"If you wanna be the best, you
gotta take on the top dog."

12:33.987 --> 12:35.222
- Maybe you guys don't get it.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.157
You're my minions.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.726
The only way I can reach my goal
is by me standing on

12:39.827 --> 12:42.830
each one of your little faces.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.865
- We used to be a minions.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.100
- But now we're manions.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.708
- "Public school enemy number
one through three,

12:55.843 --> 12:57.477
"Lionel, Jake and Tom"?

12:57.577 --> 12:58.345
What--what about me?

12:58.445 --> 12:59.947
- You?

13:00.047 --> 13:02.682
[laughs] You used
to be somebody.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.928
- Okay, oh.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.865
- These heels we got for
the dance club are killing me.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.666
- I've been late to four
classes learning

13:19.766 --> 13:22.035
how to walk
in these death traps.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.771
- It'll all be worth it when
glam walk into the club.

13:24.872 --> 13:26.139
Let's do this, ladies.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.240
Ooh Ooh.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.475
Ow.

13:28.575 --> 13:29.342
- BOTH: Ooh Ooh.

13:29.442 --> 13:32.913
- Ow.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.647
- Ooh ooh, oh!

13:39.486 --> 13:41.321
- You guys are dressed this way
because we're about to learn

13:41.421 --> 13:43.556
supe-fu, an ancient
form of combat--

13:43.656 --> 13:44.992
- Awesome.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.327
- --that can only be mastered
by patiently folding my laundry.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.130
- Double awesome.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.733
- Wait, why can't we
just fold our own laundry?

13:53.901 --> 13:57.137
- Because your
clothes are too small.

13:57.237 --> 13:57.938
- Yeah.

13:58.038 --> 14:01.774
Get in the game, Nora.

14:01.909 --> 14:04.211
Hi-ya, ya, ya.

14:04.311 --> 14:07.214
Ahhh.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.649
- See, this guy gets it.

14:09.749 --> 14:11.018
All right, I'll
be back in a bit.

14:11.118 --> 14:13.120
And when you're done, you can
rid my room of grim

14:13.220 --> 14:18.025
and evil with vacuum-fu.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.660
- Billy, is it just me or do
they these training exercises

14:20.760 --> 14:22.129
seem strange?

14:22.229 --> 14:24.231
- What seems strange
to you about this?

14:24.331 --> 14:26.766
Hi-ya, ya, ya.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.835
Ahhhh.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.070
- Everything.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.104
[sighs]

14:31.204 --> 14:33.606
Seriously, I
think Phoebe's using us.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.943
- Stop dissing our sensei and
help me supe through

14:36.043 --> 14:39.312
this chore list that fell out
of Phoebe's laundry.

14:39.412 --> 14:42.950
- That chore list--give me that.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.717
We haven't been doing
superhero training.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.486
We've just been
doing her choirs.

14:46.586 --> 14:47.354
- What?

14:47.454 --> 14:49.856
Then this supe-fu belt is a lie.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.762
But it was holding up my pants.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.234
- So I went to a restaurant
the other day, and the manager

15:01.334 --> 15:04.804
tells me that they're
closed for Christmas.

15:04.972 --> 15:08.108
So I Eastered all
over his sidewalk.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.276
- [laugh track plays]

15:09.376 --> 15:10.310
- Thank you.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.079
True story--hey, Max.

15:12.179 --> 15:13.780
Hey, why didn't
you take the slide?

15:13.880 --> 15:16.383
- Slides are for prank kings.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.785
My minions overthrew me, Colos,
so if I can't even control

15:18.885 --> 15:21.721
three nerds, how am I gonna
take over the world?

15:21.821 --> 15:25.692
- Ah, poor kid, come
here, let me give ya a hug.

15:25.792 --> 15:28.728
- Thanks, Colos, well
I could really use one.

15:28.828 --> 15:31.898
Ah.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.566
Ow!

15:33.666 --> 15:34.401
- Get a grip.

15:34.501 --> 15:35.835
Villains don't quit.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.338
Did I quit when your dad
turned me into a bunny?

15:38.438 --> 15:41.774
- You live in a cage
and poop on sawdust.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.276
- And who cleans it up?

15:43.376 --> 15:45.112
You.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.547
Now get out there, start acting
like a super villain

15:47.647 --> 15:49.916
and make 'em clean up your poop.

15:50.017 --> 15:50.883
- Yeah.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.385
Yeah, you're right.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.421
I'm Max Thunderman.

15:54.521 --> 15:57.024
I'm not about to let
three dweebs steal my mojo.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.691
- That's my Maxy.

15:58.791 --> 16:04.464
Come on, bring it in.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.533
- [laugh track playing]

16:12.605 --> 16:13.573
- Hey, guys.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.942
- Hey, has-been.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.377
- Yeah, you got me.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.812
Hey, congratulations on
being the new prank kings.

16:19.912 --> 16:22.749
- Say it, don't spray it, bro.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.851
- That doesn't
make any sense, Tom.

16:24.951 --> 16:25.818
- I know.

16:25.918 --> 16:28.655
I just always
wanted to say that.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.290
- You know, it's too bad I
never got to pull off

16:30.390 --> 16:31.624
my most epic prank.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.061
I was gonna show this amazing
video at Bradford's

16:34.127 --> 16:35.462
special assembly.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.730
- It takes one to know one.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.233
- Be cool, idiot.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.536
- Anyway, I can't wait to see
what you guys have planned.

16:43.636 --> 16:46.139
See ya around.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.974
- Oh, Max left his locker open.

16:48.075 --> 16:50.210
- Oh, I'll close it for him.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.945
- You're on thin ice, Tom.

16:53.080 --> 16:58.851
- Let's see what this
epic prank's all about.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.553
- Is that who I think it is?

17:00.653 --> 17:02.889
- We're gonna be prank legends.

17:09.096 --> 17:12.832
- Hey, you two, good job
with your superhero training.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.301
- We didn't finish
our training.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.103
We couldn't reach
that cobweb up there.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.338
- Oh, I can get that.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.739
Here.

17:27.747 --> 17:28.715
What's happening!

17:28.815 --> 17:29.982
I can't stop it!

17:30.117 --> 17:32.352
Help your sensei.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.653
What's happening?

17:33.753 --> 17:34.554
- Payback!

17:34.654 --> 17:38.525
- Also laughter.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.493
- Phoebe, what are you doing?

17:44.397 --> 17:48.235
- You could've just
unplugged it, Barb.

17:48.335 --> 17:51.304
- You wanna explain
this garbage party?

17:51.404 --> 17:53.039
- Well, it's not my fault.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.142
Billy and Nora said they were
gonna finish vacuuming my room,

17:55.175 --> 17:57.377
but they set this
thing on reverse.

17:57.477 --> 18:00.513
- Why were they
vacuuming your room?

18:00.613 --> 18:04.151
- Because they love me?

18:04.184 --> 18:06.886
- Phoebe tricked us into
doing all of her chores.

18:06.986 --> 18:10.423
She made laundry fun.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.058
- Phoebe, is this true?

18:12.159 --> 18:13.626
- No, I was helping them.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.328
We were doing
superhero training.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.164
- You made us
clean dad's toilet.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.967
- I plunged away my innocence.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.469
- Phoebe?

18:22.569 --> 18:25.037
- Okay, fine, I--I didn't have
time to get ready

18:25.172 --> 18:28.975
for the dance club and do all my
chores, so I got a little help.

18:29.075 --> 18:31.178
But Billy and Nora
got their revenge.

18:31.244 --> 18:36.749
So which dress do
you like better?

18:36.849 --> 18:39.452
I'm not going to
the dance club, am I?

18:39.552 --> 18:42.889
- You'll be too busy
cleaning up this room.

18:42.989 --> 18:45.225
- Make it super
clean, super teen.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.092
Ooh ooh.

18:46.193 --> 18:46.826
- Ooh ooh.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.028
- BOTH: Ooh ooh, ooh ooh.

18:51.698 --> 18:55.034
- [indistinct chatter]

18:55.202 --> 18:58.771
- All right, all right,
calm down, future failures.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.777
If you're here, it's because
you're a problem, a troublemaker

19:04.877 --> 19:06.646
or I don't like your face.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.681
Ah.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.017
I'm keeping that.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.520
Now there's been
a rash of pranks.

19:13.620 --> 19:17.690
Some were funny,
the others were directed at me.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.427
So you're gonna watch this
video on obeying authority.

19:20.527 --> 19:25.232
You will start
respecting me right now.

19:25.265 --> 19:29.436
Yeah, I've been
a musician all my life.

19:29.536 --> 19:32.539
Changing the world
one note at a time.

19:32.639 --> 19:33.673
Also do kid's parties.

19:33.773 --> 19:34.774
Love kids.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.276
Wait, wait, what is this?

19:36.376 --> 19:39.279
Stop this, this--this
should not be going on.

19:39.379 --> 19:44.016
This first one is called,
"Yeah, you know it."

19:44.116 --> 19:45.285
You'll see why.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.353
- [laughing]

19:46.453 --> 19:47.487
- * Yeah, you know it

19:47.587 --> 19:49.356
* Yeah, yeah, you know it

19:49.456 --> 19:50.690
* Yeah, you know it

19:50.790 --> 19:52.692
* Yeah, yeah, you know it

19:52.792 --> 19:54.394
* Oh, yaaaaa *

19:54.494 --> 19:55.828
Stop it!

19:55.928 --> 19:57.163
Stop--

19:57.264 --> 19:59.632
- Gentlemen, see you in
the prank hall of fame.

19:59.732 --> 20:00.833
- You're dismissed!

20:00.933 --> 20:05.004
Everybody out!

20:05.104 --> 20:06.639
- Is that who I think it is?

20:06.739 --> 20:10.209
- We're gonna be prank legends.

20:10.310 --> 20:13.480
- If we show this video at
the assembly, it'll be so sweet.

20:20.353 --> 20:21.921
- Lionel, Jake and Tom,

20:22.021 --> 20:24.824
you embarrassed
our beloved principal.

20:24.924 --> 20:25.892
Not cool, guys.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.495
- It was flat-out mean.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.363
- Yeah, you know it.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.699
- Should've been a hit.

20:32.799 --> 20:36.536
- Hey, you three, get up and
apologize to Principal Bradford

20:36.636 --> 20:40.440
while taking a caramel
and popcorn shower.

20:54.554 --> 20:57.624
- [laughing]

21:00.793 --> 21:02.662
- [laughs]

21:02.762 --> 21:04.531
Clean it up.

21:04.631 --> 21:09.469
Okay, losers, detention now.

21:09.569 --> 21:10.903
- Not detention.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.238
