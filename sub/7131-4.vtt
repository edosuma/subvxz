I WAS LIKE,

00:14.291 --> 00:16.250
"OH, MY GOD.
THEY'RE MAKING OUR SHOW."

00:16.250 --> 00:18.333
- NO, ACTUALLY, THE SHOW
BEV AND I ARE DOING

00:18.333 --> 00:21.041
IS VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT
THING YOU AND I KICKED AROUND.

00:21.041 --> 00:22.959
- WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.625
- FUCKING HELL.

00:27.625 --> 00:29.500
- I MISS THIS.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.500
- YEAH, THIS IS NICE.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.166
- I MEANT DRINKING.

00:34.166 --> 00:37.208
- OH, FUCK.

00:38.959 --> 00:42.125
- SO YOUR TYPE IS...

00:42.125 --> 00:43.709
- I'D SAY SMART...

00:43.709 --> 00:45.041
- [chuckles]

00:45.041 --> 00:47.500
- BEAUTIFUL...

00:47.500 --> 00:49.875
SLIGHTLY DAMAGED.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.417
YOU KNOW ANYONE LIKE THAT?

00:51.417 --> 00:53.417

01:53.667 --> 01:55.458
- I DISAGREE.

01:55.458 --> 01:57.041
- DARLING, WE ARE SO SCREWED

01:57.041 --> 01:58.959
THAT LARGE MEN WITH TOOLS
COULD NOT UNSCREW US.

01:58.959 --> 02:00.583
- OUR SCRIPT
IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT

02:00.583 --> 02:01.750
FROM WHAT'S IN THOSE NOTES.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.333
- "TOTALLY"?

02:03.333 --> 02:04.834
- ALL RIGHT,
IT'S GOT TWO FAMILIES

02:04.834 --> 02:06.333
PLAYED BY THE SAME GROUP
OF ACTORS.

02:06.333 --> 02:07.834
- YOU MEAN THE PREMISE.

02:07.834 --> 02:11.625
- FINE, THE PREMISE,
BUT IT WAS MY IDEA.

02:11.625 --> 02:13.542
HE OFFERED NOTHING.

02:13.542 --> 02:16.166
ALL TIM DID WAS TYPE IT.

02:16.166 --> 02:18.333
- WELL, CLEARLY
THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS.

02:18.333 --> 02:20.458
AND BY THE WAY, DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A LITTLE ODD

02:20.458 --> 02:22.458
THAT THIS IS THE FIRST
YOU'RE TELLING ME ANY OF THIS?

02:22.458 --> 02:24.959
- BECAUSE THERE WAS
NO "THIS" TO TELL.

02:24.959 --> 02:27.125
IT WAS JUST AN IDEA.

02:27.125 --> 02:28.625
- WELL, THERE'S A "THIS" NOW.

02:28.625 --> 02:31.083
- IT JUST PISSES ME OFF
THAT HE HAS THE NERVE

02:31.083 --> 02:33.959
TO SUDDENLY CLAIM
WE CAME UP WITH IT TOGETHER.

02:33.959 --> 02:35.166
- DOESN'T MATTER
WHO CAME UP WITH IT.

02:35.166 --> 02:36.625
YOU WERE HIS PARTNER.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.792
- ARE YOU REALLY
TAKING HIS SIDE?

02:38.792 --> 02:40.917
- OH, BELIEVE ME,
THE IRONY OF THIS--

02:40.917 --> 02:43.792
I AM CHOKING ON IT,
BUT I'M SORRY.

02:43.792 --> 02:45.834
HE IS WITHIN HIS RIGHTS.

02:45.834 --> 02:47.166
- WAIT.

02:47.166 --> 02:49.417
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT IF--

02:49.417 --> 02:52.959
IF ALBERT EINSTEIN CAME UP
WITH THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY--

02:52.959 --> 02:55.125
- REALLY? THAT'S WHO YOU'RE
COMPARING YOURSELF TO?

02:55.125 --> 02:57.667
- TO MAKE A POINT.
- FINE.

02:57.667 --> 03:00.125
IF EINSTEIN CAME UP
WITH THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY--

03:00.125 --> 03:03.375
- AND HIS USELESS PARTNER,
SHMEINSTEIN,

03:03.375 --> 03:06.667
DID NOTHING
BUT WRITE IT ON THE BOARD,

03:06.667 --> 03:09.458
HE SHOULD SHARE EQUAL CREDIT?

03:09.458 --> 03:12.375
- IF HE'S HIS PARTNER, YES.

03:12.375 --> 03:14.333
AND THEN IT WOULD
RIGHTFULLY BE CALLED

03:40.875 --> 03:44.542

03:44.542 --> 03:47.875
- HOW MUCH TEQUILA
DID WE HAVE?

03:47.875 --> 03:51.542
- I'D SAY JUST ENOUGH.

03:51.542 --> 03:55.166
- THERE GOES FOUR YEARS
OF THERAPY OUT THE WINDOW.

03:55.166 --> 03:56.709
- NAH.

04:10.792 --> 04:14.083
SO WANT TO DO SOMETHING TODAY?

04:14.083 --> 04:15.583

04:18.917 --> 04:21.166
I GOT NOTHING.
YOU GOT NOTHING.

04:21.166 --> 04:23.250
- I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE LUNCH

04:23.250 --> 04:27.709

WORSE THAN NOTHING.

04:27.709 --> 04:29.291
COME OUT TO THE BEACH.

04:29.291 --> 04:30.709
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE HOUSE
IN A WHILE.

04:30.709 --> 04:33.917
- OH, I FUCKING LOVE
THAT HOUSE.

04:33.917 --> 04:35.875
- SHOULDN'T HAVE DIVORCED ME.

04:35.875 --> 04:38.917
- IT'S NOT THAT GREAT A HOUSE.

04:38.917 --> 04:42.917

04:42.917 --> 04:44.917
- SO YEAH?

04:50.375 --> 04:51.709

THEY WERE ONE BIG ISLAND,

06:09.834 --> 06:12.000

THEY DRIFTED APART.

YOU FEEL BETTER?

06:30.208 --> 06:31.875
- A LITTLE BIT.

06:31.875 --> 06:35.375
- LAST NIGHT WAS NICE.

06:35.375 --> 06:37.375
- OH, LAST NICE WAS AMAZING.

06:37.375 --> 06:38.417
- I KNOW.

06:38.417 --> 06:40.250
AND I GOT TO SAY,

06:40.250 --> 06:42.041
FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS
NEVER DONE IT BEFORE--

06:42.041 --> 06:44.291
- IT WAS A LITTLE WEIRD
AT FIRST.

06:44.291 --> 06:47.417
I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING
TO HOLD ON TO.

06:47.417 --> 06:49.208

09:44.583 --> 09:46.583
- AH, SOMEBODY'S
IN A GOOD MOOD.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.417

09:48.417 --> 09:50.333
"HOW GREAT IS IT TO FUCK
YOUR WIFE?"

09:50.333 --> 09:52.041
- I'M SORRY, WHAT?

09:52.041 --> 09:53.667
- WHAT?

09:53.667 --> 09:55.291
OH, NO, NO, NO.

09:55.291 --> 09:56.583
NOT YOUR WIFE.

09:56.583 --> 09:58.208
ONE'S WIFE.

09:58.208 --> 10:00.250
I SEE WHY YOU'D--
BUT NO, NO, NO, NO.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.750
NO, NO,
I JUST FUCKED MY WIFE.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.834
WELL, EX-WIFE.

10:04.834 --> 10:06.083
- THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.250
- IT'S JUST SO EASY.

10:08.250 --> 10:09.834
I KNOW WHAT SHE LIKES.

10:09.834 --> 10:11.375
SHE KNOWS WHAT I LIKE.

10:11.375 --> 10:12.834
I KNOW WHAT SHE WON'T DO.

10:12.834 --> 10:16.417
SHE--WELL, THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING I WON'T DO.

10:16.417 --> 10:19.000
- SO YOU AND DIANE?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.041
AMAZING.

10:20.041 --> 10:21.250
- I KNOW.
ALMOST A WEEK NOW.

10:21.250 --> 10:22.792
- AND THE BOYFRIEND?

10:22.792 --> 10:25.333
NOT THAT THAT WOULD EVER BE
AN IMPEDIMENT TO YOU.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.792
- DONE. GONE.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.875
BYE-BYE, OLLIE.

10:28.875 --> 10:31.291
- ALL RIGHT, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA GO HERE,

10:31.291 --> 10:33.750
BUT AT ONE POINT,
YOU TALKED

10:33.750 --> 10:36.834
ABOUT AN ISSUE WITH HER...

10:39.458 --> 10:40.625
NETHER.

10:40.625 --> 10:42.291
- OH, THE LOOSE-PUSSY THING?

10:42.291 --> 10:44.000
- AND ALREADY I'M SORRY
I WENT THERE.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.333
- YEAH, SHE HAD THAT TAKEN CARE
OF AFTER THE DIVORCE.

10:46.333 --> 10:47.917
SHE HAD THAT SURGERY
WHERE THEY GET IN THERE

10:47.917 --> 10:49.792
AND TIGHTEN EVERYTHING UP.
[slurps]

10:49.792 --> 10:51.083
- DEAR GOD.

10:51.083 --> 10:52.500
- YEAH, COST ME A BUNDLE.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.500
ALTHOUGH LOOKING BACK,
MONEY WELL SPENT.

10:54.500 --> 10:57.792
SPLIT A BAGEL?

10:57.792 --> 10:59.500
[chuckles]
HEY, ANYWAY.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.959
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
SAY I'M NUTS,

11:00.959 --> 11:03.583
BUT I'M KIND OF THINKING

11:03.583 --> 11:06.291
I COULD SEE US
MAKING IT PERMANENT AGAIN.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.333
- AFTER A WEEK?
- WHY NOT?

11:08.333 --> 11:10.458
- THIS WOULDN'T BY ANY CHANCE
HAVE A LITTLE SOMETHING

11:10.458 --> 11:13.500
TO DO WITH YOUR CURRENT
FINANCIAL SITUATION?

11:13.500 --> 11:17.375
- WELL, THE SAVINGS
WOULD BE CONSIDERABLE.

11:17.375 --> 11:18.583
- THERE WE GO!

11:18.583 --> 11:20.375
- SERIOUSLY,
IF I COULD STOP PAYING

11:20.375 --> 11:22.375
ALIMONY AND CHILD SUPPORT?

11:22.375 --> 11:24.792
JESUS. I WOULDN'T HAVE
TO SELL MY VINEYARD.

11:24.792 --> 11:27.667
- YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY WORK
THAT IN WHEN YOU PROPOSE.

11:27.667 --> 11:29.750
- LOOK, WE NEVER REALLY STOPPED
LOVING EACH OTHER.

11:29.750 --> 11:32.041
AND BEING BACK
WITH MY BOYS FULL TIME?

11:32.041 --> 11:34.166
COME ON.

11:34.166 --> 11:36.291
PLUS MY MONEY GUYS THINK
I COULD GET AT LEAST $3 MILLION

11:36.291 --> 11:37.959
FOR THE HOUSE.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.166
- SO I READ THROUGH THOSE NOTES
FROM THAT TIM GUY,

11:44.166 --> 11:46.000
AND I RAN THEM PAST LEGAL.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.083
- AND?

11:47.083 --> 11:50.083
- YOU HAVE A LEGAL PROBLEM.

11:50.083 --> 11:52.333
- THANK YOU.
- SERIOUSLY?

11:52.333 --> 11:54.208
- HE'S GOT A VALID CLAIM.

11:54.208 --> 11:55.291
- LEGALLY?

11:55.291 --> 11:57.750
- LEGALLY,
ACCORDING TO LEGAL.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.458
- BLOODY HELL.
SO WHAT NOW?

12:00.458 --> 12:02.333
- I SAY LET'S GO PACK.

12:02.333 --> 12:04.166
- OKAY, NOBODY PANIC.

12:04.166 --> 12:05.917
LET ME TALK TO HIM.

12:05.917 --> 12:08.750
IF WE HAVE TO, WE'LL GIVE
HIM A LITTLE SOMETHING,

12:08.750 --> 12:11.959
BUT DON'T WORRY.
I'LL MAKE THIS GO AWAY.

12:11.959 --> 12:14.250
- GOOD LUCK. LET US KNOW.
- GOD, I HOPE SO.

12:14.250 --> 12:16.542
- AND SO THE NIGHTMARE
CONTINUES.

12:16.542 --> 12:20.125
- ACCORDING TO LEGAL.
- PERFECT.

12:20.125 --> 12:22.500
[clown horn honking]
OH, GOOD.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.333
THE IRONY BUS IS HERE.

12:33.750 --> 12:34.750
[slide whistle]

12:38.083 --> 12:41.417
STUPID TOWN.

12:41.417 --> 12:44.083
I FUCKING HATE CLOWNS.

12:48.792 --> 12:51.458
- YOU'RE HER FRIEND.
JUST ASK HER.

12:51.458 --> 12:53.625
- I CAN'T.
IT'S TOO WEIRD.

12:53.625 --> 12:55.417
- SHE'S GETTING BIGGER
EVERY DAY.

12:55.417 --> 12:57.625
- I KNOW. I FIGURE EVENTUALLY
SHE'LL EITHER HAVE A BABY

12:57.625 --> 13:00.083
OR SIX CHILEAN MINERS
WILL DIG THEIR WAY OUT.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.583
- IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

13:01.583 --> 13:03.417
- WHAT'S UNBELIEVABLE?
- OH.

13:03.417 --> 13:05.250
- JESUS, IT'S LIKE
SHE LIVES IN A CLOCK.

13:05.250 --> 13:08.208
- I...
[awkward giggle] UM...

13:08.208 --> 13:10.417
I WAS JUST TELLING ANDY

13:10.417 --> 13:14.250
I FOUND OUT MY COUSIN
KAREN IS PREGNANT.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.125
SHE'S NOT MARRIED.

13:16.125 --> 13:18.000
I DON'T THINK
SHE EVEN HAS A BOYFRIEND,

13:18.000 --> 13:22.083
BUT NOBODY CARES
BECAUSE WE ALL LOVE HER,

13:22.083 --> 13:25.417
AND WE'RE JUST HAPPY FOR HER.

13:25.417 --> 13:26.875
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

13:26.875 --> 13:28.291
- MM-HMM.

13:28.291 --> 13:30.250
MY COUSIN FRANNY HAS ALOPECIA.

13:30.250 --> 13:33.208
WITHOUT HER WIG,
SHE LOOKS LIKE BEN KINGSLEY.

13:33.208 --> 13:36.125
- SO WE'RE TELLING
COUSIN STORIES.

13:36.125 --> 13:38.000
- HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN
THIS LIST FROM MERC?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.125
- WHAT LIST?

13:39.125 --> 13:41.417
- POSSIBLE HOSTS
FOR HIS DUTCH GAME SHOW.

13:41.417 --> 13:43.041
- OH. HOW IS IT?

13:43.041 --> 13:45.625
- WELL, IT'S CLEAR
THAT HE DID IT HIMSELF.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.667
- TOO OLD. TOO OLD.

13:47.667 --> 13:50.458
WAY TOO OLD.
DEAD?

13:50.458 --> 13:52.625
- MM-HMM.
SINCE, LIKE, COCOON.

13:52.625 --> 13:54.542
I THINK WE NEED A NEW LIST.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.542
OH, AND WHEN YOU GET A SEC,

13:57.542 --> 14:00.750
I'VE GOT THOSE BUDGET NUMBERS
IN MY OFFICE.

14:00.750 --> 14:02.542
- I CAN DO THAT NOW.

14:02.542 --> 14:03.917
- GREAT.

14:03.917 --> 14:05.083
SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

14:05.083 --> 14:07.792
- BYE.
- BYE-BYE.

14:09.709 --> 14:11.625
- WHAT?
- MM.

14:11.625 --> 14:13.333
- NO.
- MM-HMM.

14:13.333 --> 14:14.667
- NO.
- MM-HMM.

14:14.667 --> 14:16.750
- REALLY?
- UH-HUH.

14:16.750 --> 14:19.041
- OH. MM.

14:31.667 --> 14:33.166
- HEY.

14:33.166 --> 14:34.583
HEY.
- HMM?

14:34.583 --> 14:37.333
- YOU GOT TO GO.

14:41.834 --> 14:43.041
- NO, I DON'T.

14:43.041 --> 14:45.000
- YEAH, YOU DO.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.875
I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE
BEFORE THE BOYS GET UP.

14:47.875 --> 14:49.750
- WHY?

14:49.750 --> 14:54.542
- I DON'T WANT TO CONFUSE 'EM.

14:54.542 --> 14:57.291
- OR...

14:57.291 --> 14:59.083
WE COULD MAKE IT
LESS CONFUSING.

14:59.083 --> 15:01.458
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT MEANS.

15:01.458 --> 15:06.542
- WHAT IF WE DID THIS IN,
LIKE, A MORE PERMANENT WAY.

15:06.542 --> 15:08.417
- ARE YOU STILL DRUNK?

15:08.417 --> 15:10.542
- [chuckles]

15:10.542 --> 15:13.709
BEFORE YOU SAY NO,

15:13.709 --> 15:17.041
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF GETTING MARRIED AGAIN?

15:17.041 --> 15:19.083
- GO HOME.

15:19.083 --> 15:20.542
- IS THAT SO CRAZY?

15:20.542 --> 15:22.834
- YEAH, THAT'S CRAZY.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.542
- WHY?

15:24.542 --> 15:26.458
THIS FEELS RIGHT.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.333
YOU KNOW IT DOES.

15:28.333 --> 15:30.750
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA
FIND THIS AGAIN, HUH?

15:30.750 --> 15:33.041
WITH STUPID OLLIE?

15:33.041 --> 15:34.750
AT LEAST WITH ME
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING.

15:34.750 --> 15:35.875
- I'LL SAY.

15:35.875 --> 15:38.834
- SO THEN WHAT?
SOMEONE NEW?

15:38.834 --> 15:41.542
YOU WANT TO START
FROM SCRATCH?

15:41.542 --> 15:43.417
UGH, SO MUCH WORK.

15:43.417 --> 15:45.125
YOU HAVE TO BE NICE
ALL THE TIME.

15:45.125 --> 15:47.083
- ONLY AT THE BEGINNING.

15:56.333 --> 15:57.792
[flatulence]

16:02.208 --> 16:03.542
- DID YOU JUST FART?

16:03.542 --> 16:04.458
- NO.

16:04.458 --> 16:06.333
- LIAR.
- SHUT UP.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.875
- SEE, WHO ELSE
CAN YOU FART IN FRONT OF?

16:08.875 --> 16:10.125
- YEAH, MARRY THAT PERSON.

16:10.125 --> 16:11.792
- OH, COME ON.

16:11.792 --> 16:14.250
THINK ABOUT THE BOYS.
HUH?

16:14.250 --> 16:18.333
HOW GREAT WOULD IT BE FOR THEM
IF WE GOT BACK TOGETHER?

16:23.125 --> 16:27.000
- AND IT'D BE DIFFERENT
NOW WHY?

16:27.000 --> 16:31.458
- 'CAUSE NOW I'D KNOW
WHAT I'D BE LOSING.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.291
- YOU'RE INSANE.

16:33.291 --> 16:35.041
- MAYBE.

16:35.041 --> 16:38.709
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

16:38.709 --> 16:41.417
- GO HOME.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.709
- YOU GOT TO ADMIT,

16:51.709 --> 16:53.875
THIS IS WAY BETTER
THAN MY LAST PROPOSAL.

16:53.875 --> 16:57.792
- IN THAT YOU WEREN'T COMING?
- EXACTLY.

16:59.166 --> 17:00.834
- SO YOU ACTUALLY
BROACHED IT WITH HER?

17:00.834 --> 17:02.250
- I BELIEVE I DID,

17:02.250 --> 17:03.417
IF "BROACHED" MEANS
WHAT I THINK IT DOES.

17:03.417 --> 17:04.583
- AND?

17:04.583 --> 17:06.083
- SHE DIDN'T SAY NO.

17:06.083 --> 17:07.875
- WELL, YOU DIDN'T THINK
SHE WOULD JUST SAY YES.

17:07.875 --> 17:10.792
SHE WAS ENGAGED TO SOMEONE ELSE,
LIKE, TWO MINUTES AGO.

17:10.792 --> 17:12.500
- I'D SAY YES TO ME.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.625
- OF COURSE,
BUT YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH YOU.

17:14.625 --> 17:18.792
- WELL, I WOULDN'T KICK ME
OUT OF BED.

17:18.792 --> 17:21.291
- AND YOU'RE REALLY READY
TO DO THIS?

17:21.291 --> 17:24.709
- WHY NOT?
- UM, IT'S A COMMITMENT?

17:24.709 --> 17:26.875
- I KNOW.
I'VE MADE COMMITMENTS BEFORE.

17:26.875 --> 17:28.917
- EXACTLY.
- THIS IS DIFFERENT.

17:28.917 --> 17:30.709
- IS IT?
- YEAH.

17:30.709 --> 17:32.375
- YOU'RE PREPARED
TO BE FAITHFUL THIS TIME?

17:32.375 --> 17:33.375
- TOTALLY.

17:33.375 --> 17:35.291
- FAITHFUL.

17:35.291 --> 17:36.792
- YES!

17:36.792 --> 17:39.041
- NO OTHER WOMEN EVER AGAIN

17:39.041 --> 17:40.792
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

17:40.792 --> 17:42.417
- OKAY, LET'S NOT GET CRAZY.

17:42.417 --> 17:43.709
[knock on door]

17:43.709 --> 17:44.792
IT'S OPEN.

17:44.792 --> 17:46.834
- THIS JUST CAME FOR YOU.

17:46.834 --> 17:48.709
IT SAYS "PERISHABLE."

17:48.709 --> 17:51.375
- GREAT. THANKS.
LEAVE IT HERE.

17:51.375 --> 17:52.959
DIANE'S FAVORITE THING
IN THE WORLD

17:52.959 --> 17:54.500
IS THESE STEAMED CRABS
FROM BALTIMORE,

17:54.500 --> 17:56.875
SO I HAD A TON OF 'EM
FLOWN IN TO SURPRISE HER.

17:56.875 --> 18:00.083
- I SEE THE BELT-TIGHTENING
IS GOING WELL.

18:00.083 --> 18:01.792
[keys clacking]

18:01.792 --> 18:02.875
- I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

18:02.875 --> 18:04.333
I COULDN'T EVEN GET A MEETING

18:04.333 --> 18:06.041
WITH A JUNIOR AGENT
FROM YOUR AGENCY,

18:06.041 --> 18:08.250
AND NOW HERE I AM
BEING TAKEN TO LUNCH

18:08.250 --> 18:10.709
BY THE FAMOUS EILEEN JAFFEE.

18:10.709 --> 18:12.583
IT'S LIKE A DREAM.

18:12.583 --> 18:15.125
- I KNOW.

18:15.125 --> 18:16.875
[keys clacking]

18:16.875 --> 18:19.417
- SO I MAY BE WAY OFF BASE,

18:19.417 --> 18:22.333
AND TELL ME IT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS--

18:22.333 --> 18:23.583
- HMM?

18:23.583 --> 18:26.041
- THE OTHER DAY ON OUR HIKE...

18:26.041 --> 18:27.208
- YEAH?

18:27.208 --> 18:28.583
- I, UM--

18:28.583 --> 18:30.750
I THOUGHT I SENSED...

18:30.750 --> 18:32.583
- MM?

18:32.583 --> 18:35.375
- A CERTAIN--

18:35.375 --> 18:39.166
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE I'M CRAZY--

18:39.166 --> 18:43.333
BETWEEN YOU AND HELEN.

18:43.333 --> 18:44.375
- MM-HMM.

18:44.375 --> 18:46.834
- REALLY?
- YEP.

18:46.834 --> 18:51.333
- HUH.
- UH-HUH.

18:51.333 --> 18:52.792
- BUT YOU'RE NOT--

18:52.792 --> 18:53.792
- MM?

18:53.792 --> 18:55.500
- SINCE WHEN?

18:55.500 --> 18:57.208
- WHAT'S TODAY?

18:57.208 --> 18:59.250
- OH.

18:59.250 --> 19:01.083
OH, MY GOD.

19:01.083 --> 19:03.500
PLEASE TELL ME THIS ISN'T JUST
BECAUSE YOU WORK FOR HER.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.458
- NO! NO, NO.

19:05.458 --> 19:07.792
THIS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

19:07.792 --> 19:09.250
- I WOULD SAY SO.

19:09.250 --> 19:11.166
- SHE IS AMAZING.

19:11.166 --> 19:14.542
IT'S EVERYTHING I ALWAYS
WANTED IN A RELATIONSHIP.

19:14.542 --> 19:15.875
- EVERYTHING?

19:15.875 --> 19:17.291
- WELL, SURE, NO DICK.

19:17.291 --> 19:18.875
BUT, HELLO, THOSE DICKS--

19:18.875 --> 19:21.291
THEY COME WITH DICKS.
- [laughs]

19:21.291 --> 19:23.875
WELL, YOURS
ALL CERTAINLY DID.

19:23.875 --> 19:27.750
- BUT WITH HER, WE HANG OUT.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.333
WE HAVE FUN.
WE--WE DO STUFF.

19:30.333 --> 19:31.959
I'VE BEEN TO HER HOUSE.

19:31.959 --> 19:33.125
- NO.

19:33.125 --> 19:35.000
- SHE THINKS I'M FUNNY.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.917
- REALLY?
- LESS SURPRISED.

19:36.917 --> 19:40.208
- REALLY?

19:40.208 --> 19:43.083
AND, UH, THE...

19:43.083 --> 19:45.959
[stammers]
PART?

19:45.959 --> 19:48.500
- LET'S JUST SAY...

19:48.500 --> 19:52.959
THE LADY KNOWS HER WAY
AROUND THE VAGINA.

19:52.959 --> 19:56.792
- YOU'D THINK I'D STOP EATING.

19:56.792 --> 19:59.000
AND, UM...
[clears throat]

19:59.000 --> 20:03.041
FROM A RECIPROCAL
STANDPOINT?

20:03.041 --> 20:07.166
- OH, WELL, OBVIOUSLY I'VE NEVER
SEEN ONE THAT CLOSE BEFORE.

20:07.166 --> 20:08.417
- OBVIOUSLY.

20:08.417 --> 20:10.375
- I THOUGHT IT'D BE
A LITTLE WEIRD,

20:10.375 --> 20:14.250
BUT ONCE YOU GET DOWN THERE,
IT'S, LIKE, "OH, I KNOW YOU."

20:14.250 --> 20:16.458
- SURE.

20:16.458 --> 20:21.750
- THE BEST PART
IS WHEN WE'RE...

20:21.750 --> 20:25.375
SHE'S REALLY THERE,
YOU KNOW?

20:25.375 --> 20:27.917
WITH THOSE GUYS,
A LOT OF THE TIME

20:27.917 --> 20:33.166
I FELT LIKE A SOCK
WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S FOOT IN IT.

20:33.166 --> 20:34.709
- OKAY, I'M DONE.

20:34.709 --> 20:39.875
- BUT WITH HELEN
IT'S LIKE WE'RE TOGETHER.

20:39.875 --> 20:43.166
IT JUST FEELS RIGHT.

20:43.166 --> 20:45.458
IT'S EASY.

20:45.458 --> 20:47.208
IT'S NICE.

20:47.208 --> 20:49.166
- MY GOD.

20:49.166 --> 20:51.375
- I KNOW.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.000
IT'S WEIRD, BUT...

20:54.000 --> 20:56.750
I THINK I MIGHT BE HAPPY.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.583
- IT CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE IT.

20:58.583 --> 21:00.083
- [giggles]

21:00.083 --> 21:03.834
- SO MAYBE IT WAS JUST ABOUT
FINDING THE RIGHT BOSS.

21:03.834 --> 21:05.083
- MAYBE.

21:05.083 --> 21:07.250
- HMM.
- MM! [giggles]

21:07.250 --> 21:09.458
- CAROL AND HELEN?
- MM-HMM.

21:09.458 --> 21:10.875
- I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.

21:10.875 --> 21:12.417
- I DON'T THINK CAROL
DID EITHER.

21:12.417 --> 21:14.875
- SO HELEN'S A--

21:14.875 --> 21:16.083
- APPARENTLY SO.

21:16.083 --> 21:19.291
- BUT CAROL'S NOT OFFICIALLY--

21:19.291 --> 21:21.083
- I DON'T THINK
SHE'S EARNED ALL HER BADGES.

21:21.083 --> 21:25.041
[phone rings]

21:25.041 --> 21:28.291
- WENDY?

21:28.291 --> 21:30.917
WENDY?

21:30.917 --> 21:32.542
WENDY!

21:32.542 --> 21:35.166
- MAYBE SHE HASN'T LEARNED
THAT'S HER NAME YET.

21:35.166 --> 21:36.917
- HELLO?
- HI.

21:36.917 --> 21:39.291
- HI, GUYS.
- OH, HELLO.

21:39.291 --> 21:42.166
- SO I JUST HAD
A LOVELY LUNCH WITH TIM.

21:42.166 --> 21:44.041
- AND?
- I'M GLAD I DID,

21:44.041 --> 21:47.166
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT
HE DOESN'T WANT MONEY.

21:47.166 --> 21:49.083
- REALLY?
- THAT'S A SURPRISE.

21:49.083 --> 21:50.959
- HE JUST WANTS
TO BE INVOLVED.

21:50.959 --> 21:52.125
- MEANING?

21:52.125 --> 21:54.083
- HE WANTS TO RUN THE SHOW
WITH YOU.

21:54.083 --> 21:56.166
- WHAT?
- THAT'S INSANE.

21:56.166 --> 21:58.792
- BY THE WAY, IF HE'S RUNNING
THE SHOW, WOULDN'T HE GET MONEY?

21:58.792 --> 22:00.709
- YES, BUT HE DOESN'T
JUST WANT MONEY.

22:00.709 --> 22:03.041
I SHOULD HAVE SAID IT
THAT WAY.

22:03.041 --> 22:04.208
- WELL, I HOPE YOU SAID NO.

22:04.208 --> 22:06.083
- I SAID I'D TALK TO YOU.

22:06.083 --> 22:08.500
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
MAKE THIS GO AWAY.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.959
- SO DID I.
- CHRIST.

22:10.959 --> 22:13.834
- LOOK,
HE'S GOT US OVER A BARREL.

22:13.834 --> 22:16.291
- NO, I HEAR YOU.

22:16.291 --> 22:18.000
WELL, IF THE ALTERNATIVE'S
A HIDEOUS LAWSUIT,

22:18.000 --> 22:19.834
MAYBE WE JUST SUCK IT UP.

22:19.834 --> 22:21.792
- I THOUGHT THE WHOLE IDEA
OF THIS SHOW

22:21.792 --> 22:23.333
IS THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE
ANY MORE SUCKING,

22:23.333 --> 22:25.500
THAT WE WERE DONE
WITH SUCKING?

22:25.500 --> 22:26.667
- MM.

22:26.667 --> 22:30.667
THERE MAY BE
A LITTLE MORE SUCK.

22:30.667 --> 22:32.333
[keys clacking]

22:35.250 --> 22:36.583
- HEY, MIRTALA.

22:36.583 --> 22:37.875
IS DIANE AROUND?

22:37.875 --> 22:39.417
- I THINK SHE'S UPSTAIRS.

22:39.417 --> 22:42.000
- GREAT.

22:45.333 --> 22:48.500
ACTUALLY...

23:05.500 --> 23:07.458
[funny voice]
HELLO!

23:07.458 --> 23:10.417
HELLO?

23:12.000 --> 23:13.166

HELLO?

23:13.166 --> 23:17.333

23:40.166 --> 23:41.834
[high-pitched voice]
HELLO.

23:41.834 --> 23:44.250
- AAH!

23:44.250 --> 23:46.000
WHAT THE FUCK?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.417
- OH, MY GOD!
GET OUT OF HERE!

23:47.417 --> 23:49.083
- WHO'S THIS?

23:49.083 --> 23:51.250

23:51.250 --> 23:52.291
- WHAT THE FUCK
IS HE DOING HERE?

23:52.291 --> 23:53.959
- WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

23:53.959 --> 23:56.917
- I'VE GOT CRABS.
- YOU'VE GOT CRABS?

23:56.917 --> 23:59.750
- NO, CRABS.

23:59.750 --> 24:01.208
CRABS.

24:03.083 --> 24:05.375
- YOU CAN'T JUST SHOW UP HERE.

24:05.375 --> 24:07.250
- YEAH, THAT'S NOT GONNA BE
A PROBLEM.

24:07.250 --> 24:08.709
- WHAT'S THAT?
- CRABS.

24:08.709 --> 24:10.917
I GOT YOU YOUR FUCKING CRABS.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.291
- FROM BALTIMORE?

24:12.291 --> 24:13.917
- YEAH, FROM BALTIMORE,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:13.917 --> 24:16.083
YOU DON'T DESERVE CRABS.
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

24:16.083 --> 24:18.458
HE--HE CAME OVER TO GET
HIS STUFF, WE STARTED TALKING.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.000
- WELL, SOMEONE
SHOULD TELL HIM

24:20.000 --> 24:21.041
NOT TO TALK
WITH HIS MOUTH FULL.

24:21.041 --> 24:22.959
- WOW.

24:22.959 --> 24:24.542
- YOU SAID YOU WERE DONE
WITH HIM.

24:24.542 --> 24:25.792
- I WAS DONE WITH HIM.

24:25.792 --> 24:27.792
I WAS DONE WITH YOU TOO.
THINGS HAPPEN.

24:27.792 --> 24:29.291
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD KNOW THAT.

24:29.291 --> 24:31.125
- DON'T MAKE THIS ABOUT ME.

24:31.125 --> 24:33.125
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
BUT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

24:33.125 --> 24:34.750
I AM DONE WITH HIM.

24:34.750 --> 24:38.625
- WELL, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I'M DONE TOO.

24:38.625 --> 24:39.875
- I'M SORRY.
IT WAS STUPID.

24:39.875 --> 24:42.792
IT MEANT NOTHING.

24:42.792 --> 24:45.000
- NOT TO US.

24:52.083 --> 24:55.959
- IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,
THESE ARE DELICIOUS.

24:55.959 --> 24:57.750
- NOPE.
NO CONSOLATION.

24:57.750 --> 25:00.333
- WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I AM REALLY NOT A FAN.

25:00.333 --> 25:03.333
- I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
- IT'S SO SHOCKING.

25:03.333 --> 25:06.500
- I KEEP PICTURING
THE FOUR OF YOU IN THAT SHOWER.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.834
- YOU'RE COUNTING THE CRAB?
- I WAS.

25:08.834 --> 25:10.500
- HOW COULD SHE DO THIS TO ME?

25:10.500 --> 25:12.458
- I KNOW.

25:12.458 --> 25:14.083
- LOOK, I KNOW
HOW YOU'RE FEELING RIGHT NOW.

25:14.083 --> 25:15.083
- NO, YOU DON'T.

25:15.083 --> 25:16.875
- WELL, I CAN IMAGINE.

25:16.875 --> 25:17.917
- NO, YOU CAN'T.

25:17.917 --> 25:19.291
- NEVERTHELESS,

25:19.291 --> 25:22.125
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S DEFINITELY OVER?

25:22.125 --> 25:23.792
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

25:23.792 --> 25:25.583
- SHE SAID IT WAS A MISTAKE
AND JUST A ONE-TIME THING.

25:25.583 --> 25:27.917
- AND I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE OKAY WITH THAT?

25:27.917 --> 25:31.000
- NO, BUT OTHER PEOPLE
HAVE MANAGED

25:31.000 --> 25:33.458
TO GET PAST THINGS
LIKE THIS.

25:33.458 --> 25:38.250
- I DON'T FUCKING KNOW HOW.

25:38.250 --> 25:42.000
- IS IT WORTH POINTING OUT
THE IRONY OF THE NUMBER OF TIMES

25:42.000 --> 25:44.333
YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING
LIKE THIS TO HER?

25:44.333 --> 25:47.709
- NO. IT IS NOT WORTH
POINTING OUT THE IRONY.

25:47.709 --> 25:50.083
IN FACT, I WILL GO SO FAR
AS TO SAY IT IS NEVER

25:50.083 --> 25:54.417
WORTH POINTING OUT THE IRONY...
IN LIFE...TO ANYONE...EVER.

25:54.417 --> 25:56.667
- NOTED.

25:57.917 --> 26:00.041
- GOD DAMN IT.

26:00.041 --> 26:02.041
IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO GOOD--

26:02.041 --> 26:04.333
THE TWO OF US BACK TOGETHER,

26:04.333 --> 26:06.542
SEEING MY BOYS EVERY DAY.

26:06.542 --> 26:08.041
AND NOW...

26:08.041 --> 26:10.750
I'M GONNA
HAVE TO SELL MY VINEYARD!

26:13.959 --> 26:16.208
