WEBVTT

00:00.136 --> 00:03.136
I HAVE A 1962 IMPALA.
IT'S ALL ORIGINAL.

00:03.136 --> 00:04.438
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON "BETRAYAL"...</i>

00:04.438 --> 00:06.345
T.J. WAS WITH ME THAT NIGHT.

00:06.345 --> 00:08.675
HOW MUCH IS THATCHER KARSTEN
PAYING YOU TO SAY THAT?

00:10.082 --> 00:12.926
<i> IT'S NOT OVER,</i>
<i>NOT BY A LONG SHOT.</i>

00:12.926 --> 00:16.863
THEY BROUGHT THE BATTLE TO US,
SO THIS IS WAR.

00:16.863 --> 00:17.864
UNH!

00:22.169 --> 00:23.236
WHAT DO YOU WANT, ZAREK?

00:23.236 --> 00:25.305
I WANT TO BE A FULL MEMBER
OF THE TEAM.

00:25.305 --> 00:26.540
THAT'S BETWEEN
YOU AND THATCHER.

00:26.540 --> 00:27.707
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED NOW.

00:27.707 --> 00:30.077
DON'T THREATEN ME.

00:35.015 --> 00:37.517
I'LL TAKE IT.

00:37.517 --> 00:39.953
IT'S A LOT OF SPACE
FOR ONE PERSON.

00:39.953 --> 00:41.421
IT IS JUST YOU, RIGHT?

00:42.489 --> 00:44.458
YES.

00:44.458 --> 00:45.892
I'M A LONE WOLF.

00:45.892 --> 00:50.630
FREE. UNENCUMBERED.

00:50.630 --> 00:52.265
VERY GREEDY.

00:52.265 --> 00:53.834
HMM.

00:53.834 --> 00:55.702
I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE
THE RIGHT BUYER FOR THIS.

00:57.337 --> 01:00.540
OH, WELL, I FLEW
ALL THE WAY HERE FROM LISBON.

01:00.540 --> 01:03.577
OH, I'M SORRY THAT YOU WENT
TO SO MUCH TROUBLE.

01:07.781 --> 01:08.915
ARE YOU, UH,

01:08.915 --> 01:12.219
ARE YOU SURE
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO...

01:12.219 --> 01:15.288
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND?

01:15.288 --> 01:17.290
LIKE WHAT?

01:21.428 --> 01:23.130
I'M SORRY,

01:23.130 --> 01:24.664
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

01:28.802 --> 01:31.671
MISS, THIS
IS HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE.

01:31.671 --> 01:34.074
I JUST REALLY...

01:34.074 --> 01:36.510
WANT...

01:36.510 --> 01:38.245
THIS APARTMENT.

02:17.684 --> 02:19.152

02:19.152 --> 02:23.723
HE ALWAYS WANTS YOU.

02:23.723 --> 02:25.825
HE KNOWS YOU'RE MARRIED.
WHAT'S THE HARM?

02:25.825 --> 02:27.928
PART OF BEING MARRIED
IS KNOWING

02:27.928 --> 02:30.764

MAYBE
IT'S A DAD'S-NIGHT-OUT THING.

UM, ALL RIGHT. TALK LATER.

02:50.951 --> 02:53.587
AIDAN!

02:53.587 --> 02:56.256

<i>...INCLUDING HOTELS,</i>

03:11.171 --> 03:13.139
CHINA?
MM-HMM.

03:13.139 --> 03:15.208
NO, NO, NO.
LET'S WAIT ON THAT.

03:15.208 --> 03:17.544
LOOK, IF WE CAN GET SOME MORE
OUT OF OUR U.S. SUPPLIERS --

03:17.544 --> 03:19.846

03:19.846 --> 03:21.815
I'M WORKING ON IT

03:21.815 --> 03:23.116
WE'RE NOT GOING
THROUGH CUSTOMS.

03:24.684 --> 03:26.653
SO, WHAT,
WE SMUGGLE THEM IN?

03:26.653 --> 03:28.955
10,000 PANELS
ARE ARRIVING TONIGHT.

03:28.955 --> 03:31.191
I WANT YOU TO BE THERE
TO RECEIVE THEM.

03:32.225 --> 03:34.094
THAT IS NOT PART
OF MY JOB DESCRIPTION.

03:34.094 --> 03:36.730
WELL, YOUR JOB DESCRIPTION
IS CHANGING.

03:36.730 --> 03:39.899
NEED SOME HELP
WITH THAT, JACK?

03:39.899 --> 03:41.434
NO, I DON'T THINK
THAT WILL BE NECESSARY.

03:41.434 --> 03:43.270
OH, LOOK AT HIM --

03:43.270 --> 03:46.773
SUCH A STAND-UP GUY,
EVERYTHING ABOVE BOARD.

03:46.773 --> 03:48.975
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD COME.

03:50.110 --> 03:51.478
GOOD.

03:51.478 --> 03:53.580
THE PANELS SHOULD BE THERE
AROUND 10:00.

03:53.580 --> 03:55.915
YOU'LL NEED TO BREAK THE SEAL.

03:55.915 --> 03:58.018
ONCE YOU'VE CHECKED OUT

04:17.771 --> 04:18.872
OH.

04:18.872 --> 04:21.041
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO WORKING WITH YOU.

04:21.041 --> 04:23.243
I LOVED YOUR SERIES
ON THE REVOLUTION IN EGYPT.

04:23.243 --> 04:26.846
I THINK IT WAS IN<i> NEWSWEEK.</i>
IT WAS -- IT WAS SO POWERFUL.

04:26.846 --> 04:29.115
TWO YEARS AGO, I WAS COVERING
REBELS IN TAHRIR SQUARE.

04:29.115 --> 04:32.419
NOW I'M DOING A PROFILE
OF A LOCAL C.E.O.

04:32.419 --> 04:34.120
FOR A LOCAL MAGAZINE.

04:34.120 --> 04:36.356
UH, WELL, YOU KNOW,

04:36.356 --> 04:39.392
BOYD'S ACTUALLY MORE COMPLICATED
THAN I EXPECTED.

04:39.392 --> 04:41.294
COULD BE GOOD
FOR THE STORY, SO...

04:41.294 --> 04:44.030
I'M HEADING OVER THERE NOW
IF YOU WANT TO SHARE A CAB.

04:44.030 --> 04:46.266
THAT'S OKAY.
I HAVE A CAR.

04:47.600 --> 04:51.204
SHE IS TALENTED
BUT REQUIRES SPECIAL HANDLING.

04:51.204 --> 04:53.340
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
I'LL HANDLE HER.

04:53.340 --> 04:55.008
I LIKE IT,
BUT WHAT'S WITH YOU?

04:55.008 --> 04:56.509
YOU'RE SO AGREEABLE
LATELY.

04:56.509 --> 04:58.978

05:09.489 --> 05:11.358
HIS NAME'S AIDAN.

05:11.358 --> 05:12.792
HE'S 29.

05:12.792 --> 05:14.661
HMM. REALLY?

05:14.661 --> 05:16.629
AIDAN?

05:16.629 --> 05:18.565
IS THAT A MAN'S NAME?

05:19.699 --> 05:20.867
IS IT SO HARD TO BELIEVE?

05:20.867 --> 05:23.403
WHAT, A CRUSH ON YOU?
OF COURSE NOT.

05:26.239 --> 05:28.208
THANKS FOR TELLING ME,
I GUESS.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.477
WELL,
WOULDN'T YOU TELL ME

05:30.477 --> 05:32.178
IF SOME HOT, YOUNG THING
HAD A CRUSH ON YOU?

05:36.616 --> 05:39.219
SO HE'S HOT<i> AND</i> YOUNG.

05:39.219 --> 05:40.520
MM-HMM.

05:40.520 --> 05:42.188
AND HE'S GOT GOOD TASTE.

05:42.188 --> 05:43.423
IMPECCABLE.

05:43.423 --> 05:45.058
HE'S A WINE GUY.

05:45.058 --> 05:47.026
HMM.

05:47.026 --> 05:48.261
I GOT TO GO TO WORK.

05:48.261 --> 05:51.398
UH, DON'T WAIT UP.

05:56.569 --> 06:01.241
IT'S A BUNCH OF SUN PANELS,
NOT HEROIN, NOT C-4.

06:01.241 --> 06:02.542
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

06:02.542 --> 06:04.444
TRADE RULES
ARE COMPLICATED.

06:04.444 --> 06:06.613
IT SHOULDN'T BE ILLEGAL,
BUT IT IS.

06:06.613 --> 06:08.848
IT'S ALL GOOD.
I'LL GET MY TRUCKS IN.

06:10.250 --> 06:11.684
DOES IT MAKE YOU
SLEEP BETTER AT NIGHT

06:11.684 --> 06:13.052
THINKING THIS SHOULDN'T
BE ILLEGAL?

06:13.052 --> 06:15.655
DRIVE IN.
WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

06:18.558 --> 06:19.692
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE

06:19.692 --> 06:21.428
DOESN'T HAVE THE STOMACH
FOR HIS JOB ANYMORE.

06:21.428 --> 06:23.463
WELL, AT LEAST I STILL HAVE
THE BRAINS FOR IT.

06:25.732 --> 06:27.233
HEY, HENRY.
HEY.

06:27.233 --> 06:28.568
HOW'S YOUR LITTLE GIRL?

06:28.568 --> 06:31.070
BETTER.
SHE'S IN REHAB NOW.

06:31.070 --> 06:34.707
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP
WITH THE COPS.

06:34.707 --> 06:36.242
YOU DOING OKAY?

06:38.144 --> 06:39.846
IT'S A BAD NIGHT, JACK.

06:39.846 --> 06:41.147
YOU UNDER THE WEATHER?

06:41.147 --> 06:42.582
REAL BAD NIGHT.

06:44.451 --> 06:46.286
YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

06:49.522 --> 06:50.557
WE'RE BEING WATCHED.

06:50.557 --> 06:52.158
WE HAVE TO TURN
THE TRUCKS AROUND.

06:52.158 --> 06:53.259
TURN AROUND!

06:53.259 --> 06:55.495
TURN AROUND!
OUT OF HERE, OUT OF HERE!

07:02.869 --> 07:04.471
WHERE ARE THEY GOING?

07:04.471 --> 07:06.039
WHY ARE THEY
TURNING AROUND?

07:06.039 --> 07:08.074
IF THEY DON'T MOVE
THE CONTRABAND,
WE'VE GOT NOTHING.

07:19.819 --> 07:20.820
HOW DID THEY KNOW?

07:20.820 --> 07:21.821
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT,

07:21.821 --> 07:23.490
BUT WE HAVE TO STAY
WITHIN THE LINES

07:23.490 --> 07:26.092
AND MAKE SURE NOTHING
COULD BE USED AGAINST US.

07:26.092 --> 07:27.760
WE HAVE A RAT, JACK.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.529
SOMEONE INSIDE THIS COMPANY
HAS TURNED ON US.

07:31.431 --> 07:33.666
THEY'RE GUILTY.
IT'S OBVIOUS.

07:33.666 --> 07:35.935
SNEAKING AROUND
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

07:35.935 --> 07:37.103
COVERING THEIR TRACKS.

07:37.103 --> 07:39.305
A FLEET OF TRUCKS
DROVE IN AND OUT, EMPTY.

07:39.305 --> 07:40.940
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR A WARRANT,
YOUR HONOR.

07:40.940 --> 07:43.142
THERE WAS A TIME NO ONE
HAD THE BALLS TO CROSS ME.

07:43.142 --> 07:44.711
THIS IS THE TIME TO STRIKE.

07:44.711 --> 07:46.446
WE HAVE TO STAY
A STEP AHEAD.

07:46.446 --> 07:47.947
WE HAVE TO CATCH THEM NOW.

07:47.947 --> 07:49.649
THIS WHOLE THING'S
ABOUT TO BLOW UP.

08:15.975 --> 08:17.577
WE'VE GOT NOTHING.

08:17.577 --> 08:19.612
THEY DESTROYED IT ALL.

08:22.215 --> 08:23.783
I LOVE YOU.

09:13.441 --> 09:16.011
ANYTHING MISSING?

09:22.517 --> 09:23.752
OH, YEAH.

09:25.554 --> 09:26.688
THE BULB FROM THE LID.

09:26.688 --> 09:28.390
OTHER THAN THAT?

09:28.390 --> 09:31.326
ANYTHING WRONG
WITH THIS PICTURE?

09:32.961 --> 09:35.297
YEAH, I REPLACED
THE CARDBOARDS

09:35.297 --> 09:37.699
FOR A 1960, NOT '62.

09:37.699 --> 09:39.234
KEEN EYE.

09:41.203 --> 09:44.172
YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.

09:45.941 --> 09:49.711
HEY, Y-YOU DON'T NEED ANY EXTRA
HELP AROUND HERE, DO YOU?

09:49.711 --> 09:52.747
I CAN PULL ENGINES OUT
AND -- AND TAKE OFF HOODS.

09:52.747 --> 09:55.016
SERIOUSLY?

09:55.016 --> 09:57.018
KNOW A HELL MORE ABOUT CARS
THAN YOU DO.

09:57.018 --> 09:58.253
I'M HAPPY TO CLEAN TIRES.

09:58.253 --> 10:00.689
I KNOW HOW TO USE THAT GEL
TO MAKE THEM LOOK NEW.

10:03.058 --> 10:04.226
I GUESS
WE COULD TRY IT OUT.

10:04.226 --> 10:06.595
OH, THAT'D BE GREAT.
THANKS.

10:06.595 --> 10:08.029
THANKS.

10:08.029 --> 10:09.931
I'VE HIRED
A NEW SECURITY TEAM

10:09.931 --> 10:11.166
TO SWEEP THE OFFICE
FOR BUGS.

10:11.166 --> 10:12.467
WE'LL HAVE THEM START
IN THATCHER'S OFFICE --

10:12.467 --> 10:13.969
McALLISTER,
JACK McALLISTER. IS HE IN?

10:13.969 --> 10:15.003
SIR, IF YOU DON'T HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT --

10:15.003 --> 10:16.538
UH, W-WHAT'S THE TROUBLE?

10:16.538 --> 10:18.006
MR. McALLISTER,
DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN?

10:18.006 --> 10:19.708
YOU VIC'S DAD?
YEAH. WHO ARE YOU?

10:19.708 --> 10:22.110
VIC ATTACKED MY SON
WITH A BASEBALL BAT.
WHAT?

10:22.110 --> 10:23.545
WE NEED SECURITY ON --
RICKY'S IN THE HOSPITAL!

10:23.545 --> 10:24.779
LOOK, I KNOW THEY HAD A FIGHT,
BUT HE --

10:24.779 --> 10:25.847
AFTER THAT!

10:25.847 --> 10:27.082
YOUR KID
HIT HIM WITH A BAT

10:27.082 --> 10:28.750
AND LEFT HIM
BLEEDING ON THE SIDEWALK!

10:28.750 --> 10:30.185
HEY. EASY NOW, PAL.

10:30.185 --> 10:31.553
YEAH, LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, ALL RIGHT?

10:31.553 --> 10:32.554
HEY!

10:32.554 --> 10:33.555
HEY!

10:33.555 --> 10:34.623
I'M NOT LETTING HIM
OFF THE HOOK,

10:34.623 --> 10:36.925
AND I'M NOT LETTING YOU
OFF THE HOOK!

10:36.925 --> 10:38.126
WOW.

10:38.126 --> 10:39.995
YOU SCREWING HIS WIFE, TOO?

10:39.995 --> 10:42.697
SHUT UP.

10:42.697 --> 10:44.165
HEY.

10:44.165 --> 10:45.300
HEY.

10:45.300 --> 10:47.769
I GOT SOME REALLY INTERESTING
STUFF TODAY.

10:47.769 --> 10:49.971
AND I GOT A CALL FROM
THE COMPANY'S PUBLICIST.

10:49.971 --> 10:52.674
I HEAR YOU'RE TAKING UP
A LOT OF THEIR TIME.

10:52.674 --> 10:54.776
WELL,
BOYD'S A DIFFICULT GUY.

10:54.776 --> 10:57.145
THERE ARE A LOT OF ANGLES HERE,
LIKE HIS EX-C.T.O.

10:57.145 --> 10:58.313
YOU PHOTOGRAPHED HER?

10:58.313 --> 11:00.949
WELL, SHE SUED HIM
FOR HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT

11:00.949 --> 11:01.950
AND WON.

11:01.950 --> 11:03.685
HER STORY'S PRETTY INTENSE.

11:03.685 --> 11:06.221
THIS IS YOUR FIRST COVER,
ISN'T IT?

11:08.223 --> 11:09.224
YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:09.224 --> 11:10.759
I'LL LEAVE MY PRINTS
ON YOUR DESK.

11:10.759 --> 11:12.327
I THINK YOU MIGHT
FIND THEM USEFUL.

11:12.327 --> 11:13.962
LET'S SEE.

11:13.962 --> 11:16.164
MY STORY WILL BE
IN THE MAGAZINE QUEUE

11:16.164 --> 11:17.432
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

11:17.432 --> 11:18.433
READ IT.

11:19.868 --> 11:23.104
AFTER WE BROKE UP, I MOVED HERE,
BUT SHE KEPT THE RING,

11:23.104 --> 11:24.439
WHICH WOULD HAVE
COME IN HANDY

11:24.439 --> 11:25.573
FOR FIRST
AND LAST MONTH'S RENT.

11:25.573 --> 11:27.742
OH. YEAH, THAT'S ROUGH.

11:27.742 --> 11:29.144
HOW LONG WERE YOU TOGETHER?

11:29.144 --> 11:30.578
SIX MONTHS.

11:30.578 --> 11:31.980
SIX MONTHS?

11:31.980 --> 11:34.349
WHAT,
THEN IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE?

11:34.349 --> 11:35.684
WELL, I MEAN,
YOU REALLY SHOULD

11:35.684 --> 11:37.385
STILL BE IN THE HONEYMOON PHASE
AT THAT POINT.

11:37.385 --> 11:39.254
YOU KNOW, YOU -- YOU WANT
TO BE TOGETHER ALL THE TIME.

11:39.254 --> 11:40.755
YOU CAN'T KEEP YOUR HANDS
OFF EACH OTHER.

11:40.755 --> 11:42.924
AND AFTER
THE HONEYMOON PHASE?

11:44.926 --> 11:48.129
THE MYSTERY
TURNS INTO SECURITY.

11:48.129 --> 11:50.999
AND YOU HAVE KIDS,
AND THEN YOU JUST STOP...

11:50.999 --> 11:53.368
NEEDING SO MUCH.

11:53.368 --> 11:54.869
WOW.

11:54.869 --> 11:56.371
MARRIAGE SOUNDS AWESOME.

12:02.310 --> 12:04.412
OH, SORRY.

12:04.412 --> 12:06.848
THIS IS ABOUT MY SON.

12:06.848 --> 12:11.052
TEENAGE BOYS --
THAT'S ANOTHER AWESOME THING.

12:13.655 --> 12:15.623
LOOK, WE NEED TO MONITOR
EVERYONE COMING IN AND OUT.

12:15.623 --> 12:16.791
MORE CAMERAS...

12:16.791 --> 12:18.526
...ACCESS CONTROL POINTS.

12:18.526 --> 12:20.395
WHY IS THAT BEEPING?

12:20.395 --> 12:22.697
WELL, THE COMPUTER AND PHONE
MAY BE SETTING IT OFF.

12:22.697 --> 12:25.500
WE'LL REMOVE THEM AFTER
WE'VE FINISHED THE GENERAL SCAN

12:25.500 --> 12:26.968
AND SWEEP THE AREA AGAIN.

12:26.968 --> 12:28.470
HEY, CAN WE TALK?

12:28.470 --> 12:30.205
HI. UH, I'M SORRY.

12:30.205 --> 12:31.573
COULD YOU EXCUSE US,
PLEASE?

12:31.573 --> 12:32.574
OH. NO PROBLEM.

12:32.574 --> 12:34.576
BE HERE ALL WEEK.

12:37.445 --> 12:38.680
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

12:38.680 --> 12:43.051
WELL, AFTER I, UH,
GOT YOUR TEXT, I TALKED TO VIC,

12:43.051 --> 12:45.620
AND HE SAYS
HE DIDN'T DO IT.

12:45.620 --> 12:46.821
YOU BELIEVE HIM?

12:46.821 --> 12:48.857
I WANT TO BELIEVE HIM.

12:48.857 --> 12:51.793
I-I MEAN, I DO, BUT, UH --

12:51.793 --> 12:53.695
HE'S BEEN BOXING.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

12:53.695 --> 12:54.863
NO.
WITH MY FATHER?

12:54.863 --> 12:56.564
NO, I DIDN'T.

12:58.566 --> 13:01.302
I JUST FEEL LIKE WE'RE LIVING
IN SEPARATE WORLDS.

13:01.302 --> 13:03.004
WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH EACH OTHER.

13:03.004 --> 13:04.272
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE TEENAGERS.

13:04.272 --> 13:05.407
I MEAN,
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

13:05.407 --> 13:08.643
NOT JUST THEM. US, TOO.
YOU AND ME.

13:11.679 --> 13:13.281
YOU FORGOT THE SPRINKLERS.

13:13.281 --> 13:15.984
THE TOMATOES ARE DRIED UP.
THE TURNIPS ARE DEAD.

13:17.218 --> 13:20.522
WELL, I NEVER
REALLY LIKED TURNIPS ANYWAY.

13:20.522 --> 13:22.524
I'M SORRY.

13:22.524 --> 13:24.926
UH, I'VE BEEN DISTRACTED --
YOU KNOW, T.J.'s CASE.

13:24.926 --> 13:27.262
THIS A.S.A. GUY'S
ALL OVER US.

13:30.265 --> 13:33.668
ARE WE OKAY?

13:38.273 --> 13:41.776
LOOK, I-I'M STUCK HERE LATE
WITH SECURITY, BUT...

13:41.776 --> 13:45.447
HOW ABOUT WE, UH,
GO OUT TOMORROW NIGHT TOGETHER?

13:45.447 --> 13:46.815
DOES THAT SOUND GOOD?

13:46.815 --> 13:48.349
YEAH. I WOULD LIKE THAT.

13:50.351 --> 13:52.787
I'LL TALK TO VIC.

13:55.590 --> 13:58.159
SHE IGNORED
EVERYTHING I GAVE HER.

13:58.159 --> 13:59.961
I MEAN, HER ARTICLE
COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN

13:59.961 --> 14:00.995
BY BOYD'S P.R. FLACK.

14:00.995 --> 14:03.164
GUESS I SHOULDN'T
BE SO SURPRISED.

14:03.164 --> 14:05.400
I MEAN,
PHOTOGRAPHERS CAN SEE THINGS

14:05.400 --> 14:06.768
THAT REPORTERS DON'T.

14:07.936 --> 14:09.003
WHY?

14:09.003 --> 14:10.071
I DON'T KNOW.

14:10.071 --> 14:13.107
WE JUST GET AT STUFF
FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE.

14:16.244 --> 14:18.046
CAREFUL, BUDDY.

14:18.046 --> 14:20.248
GO WASH YOUR HANDS.

14:23.818 --> 14:25.386
HEY, DO YOU THINK IT'S OKAY

14:25.386 --> 14:27.822
THAT OLLIE EATS
MAC AND CHEESE EVERY DAY?

14:27.822 --> 14:30.925
I MEAN, JOELLE'S TURNED
HER WHOLE FAMILY VEGAN.

14:30.925 --> 14:32.961
GROWS THEIR OWN VEGGIES
IN THE BACKYARD.

14:32.961 --> 14:35.430
IT'S A THING NOW.

14:35.430 --> 14:38.633
McALLISTER'S WIFE
DOES TURNIPS AND TOMATOES.

14:41.669 --> 14:44.105
OLIVER, DINNER'S READY!

14:44.105 --> 14:46.841
I LOVE THIS PICTURE.

14:46.841 --> 14:49.344
REMEMBER?

14:49.344 --> 14:51.279
YOU COULD GET HIM TO STOP CRYING
BY HANDING HIM A BALLOON.

14:55.783 --> 14:57.819
WE NEED TO GO AT THIS
FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE.

14:57.819 --> 14:59.354
OUR WARRANT EXPIRES
IN 24 HOURS.

14:59.354 --> 15:00.588
LOOK, THE PROBLEM IS,

15:00.588 --> 15:02.524
WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET KARSTEN ON THE BIG STUFF,

15:02.524 --> 15:04.125
THE HARD STUFF --
RACKETEERING, CORRUPTION.

15:04.125 --> 15:05.827
INSTEAD, WE NEED
TO GO AFTER SOMETHING EASIER,

15:05.827 --> 15:06.828
MORE ATTAINABLE.

15:06.828 --> 15:07.829
LIKE WHAT?

15:07.829 --> 15:10.164
WITNESS TAMPERING.

15:10.164 --> 15:12.834
WE GET THE HOOKER
TO GO TO KARSTEN WEARING A WIRE.

15:12.834 --> 15:15.270
SHE GETS HIM TO ADMIT
HE PAID HER TO BE T.J.'s ALIBI.

15:15.270 --> 15:16.504
THAT'S ASKING A LOT.

15:16.504 --> 15:18.006
SHE ALREADY PLANTED A BUG
FOR US.

15:18.006 --> 15:20.308
AND IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
WE CAN'T TRAIN HER IN 24 HOURS.

15:20.308 --> 15:21.576
LARRY,
YOU ARE RETIRING.

15:21.576 --> 15:23.811
WE NEED TO GET YOU
ONE BIG VICTORY TO RIDE OUT ON.

15:23.811 --> 15:25.580
THE PARTY TONIGHT'S
MORE THAN ENOUGH.

15:25.580 --> 15:27.649
LOOK, THIS GIRL
HAS SPENT HER ENTIRE LIFE

15:27.649 --> 15:30.151
PRETENDING SHE THINKS
AND FEELS THINGS SHE DOESN'T.

15:30.151 --> 15:32.186
SHE CAN DO THIS.
SHE'S GREAT AT LYING.

15:32.186 --> 15:34.289
BUSINESS, WHERE ARE WE
WITH THE MICHAEL BOYD ARTICLE?

15:34.289 --> 15:35.390
COVER LINE --

15:35.390 --> 15:37.992
MR. COOL."

15:37.992 --> 15:39.494
PHOTOS?

15:39.494 --> 15:41.029
UH, FINE.
I'M STILL WORKING ON THEM.

15:41.029 --> 15:42.363
CULTURE?

15:42.363 --> 15:45.533
COLUMN ON WHY THE NATIONAL MEDIA
LOVES TO BEAT UP ON CHICAGO.

15:45.533 --> 15:46.868
WOW.
THAT OLD CHESTNUT.

15:49.537 --> 15:51.906
ALISSA, COULD THE THREE OF US
TALK AFTER?

15:51.906 --> 15:53.841
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

15:53.841 --> 15:56.110
NO.

15:56.110 --> 15:57.946
I'LL TELL YOU LATER.

15:57.946 --> 16:00.982
TELL ME NOW.
THAT'S WHAT THIS MEETING IS FOR.

16:05.520 --> 16:06.654
IT'S JUST, I DON'T THINK

16:06.654 --> 16:08.289
THAT THE PHOTOS
AND THE STORY MATCH UP.

16:08.289 --> 16:10.758
DEAR GOD.

16:10.758 --> 16:12.961
YOU'RE LIKE A LITTLE
WIND-UP TOY THAT WON'T STOP.

16:12.961 --> 16:14.963
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

16:14.963 --> 16:17.465
OKAY.

16:20.134 --> 16:21.736
THIS IS BOYD
ACCEPTING THE AWARD

16:21.736 --> 16:24.405
FOR MOST ECO-FRIENDLY C.E.O.
IN CHICAGO.

16:24.405 --> 16:28.476
AND THIS IS THE HUMMER
THAT HE KEEPS AT HIS LAKE HOUSE.

16:28.476 --> 16:29.978
WE'RE ALL HYPOCRITES. SO?

16:29.978 --> 16:32.480
THIS IS BOYD
SCREAMING AT HIS HEAD OF H.R.

16:32.480 --> 16:35.083
ALISSA,
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

16:35.083 --> 16:37.251
THE WOMAN IN ACCOUNTING
HE FIRED

16:37.251 --> 16:39.420
AFTER SHE REFUSED
TO GO OUT WITH HIM.

16:39.420 --> 16:41.556
BOYD'S NOT THE BEST ANYTHING
IN CHICAGO.

16:41.556 --> 16:44.025
HE'S JUST A PHONY JERK
WHO MADE A LOT OF MONEY.

16:44.025 --> 16:46.327
FOR HIS COMPANY
AND HIS SHAREHOLDERS...
SO HE'S TALENTED.

16:46.327 --> 16:48.062
...WHICH IS HOW WE JUDGE
C.E.O. PERFORMANCE!

16:48.062 --> 16:50.064
DOES THAT MEAN HE GETS AWAY
WITH WHATEVER HE WANTS?!

16:50.064 --> 16:52.066
IT'S NOT OUR JOB
TO PROTECT HIS IMAGE,

16:52.066 --> 16:54.068
AND I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE

16:54.068 --> 16:56.170
WOULD AGREE WITH THAT.

17:07.448 --> 17:10.585
I'M GONNA NEED
A DIFFERENT PHOTOGRAPHER.

17:18.824 --> 17:20.088
WHO WAS THAT IN THERE?

17:20.088 --> 17:22.204
OKAY,
MAYBE I WAS OUT OF LINE,

17:22.204 --> 17:24.606
BUT WEREN'T YOU
A LITTLE BIT GLAD
I SAID WHAT I SAID?

17:24.606 --> 17:26.342
BUT WHAT CAME OVER YOU?

17:26.342 --> 17:28.051
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING
MY JOB.

17:28.051 --> 17:29.686
JANET'S WRITING
A TOTAL PUFF PIECE.

17:29.686 --> 17:31.521
AND WE RUN THOSE
SOMETIMES.

17:31.521 --> 17:32.400
WHY?

17:32.400 --> 17:35.046
DOES BOYD'S COMPANY
BUY A LOT OF ADS OR SOMETHING?

17:35.046 --> 17:37.948
LOOK, SARA, WE CAN'T USE
THESE PICTURES, OKAY?

17:37.948 --> 17:40.351
BUT THEY ARE FANTASTIC,

17:40.351 --> 17:41.752
SO I'M GONNA CALL MY FRIEND
AT<i> THE NEW YORK TIMES</i>

17:41.752 --> 17:43.354
AND SEE IF THEY WANT
TO ORDER UP REPORTING.

17:43.354 --> 17:45.356
ARE YOU SERIOUS?!

17:45.356 --> 17:46.991
THANK YOU!

17:46.991 --> 17:49.694
THIS NEW SARA, THIS --
THIS WHOLE TRANSFORMATION,

17:49.694 --> 17:50.928
IT'S BECAUSE OF HIM,
ISN'T IT?

17:50.928 --> 17:51.996
IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

17:51.996 --> 17:53.130
THE CRAZY FLING
THAT YOU'RE HAVING.

17:53.130 --> 17:55.633
IT'S NOT A FLING.
THEN WHAT IS IT?

17:57.535 --> 17:59.370
I TOLD HIM I LOVED HIM.

18:00.738 --> 18:02.306
DAMN.

18:02.306 --> 18:04.141
YOU ARE IN TROUBLE.

18:07.378 --> 18:08.446
<i>AGH!</i>

18:08.446 --> 18:09.814
<i>UNH!</i>

18:09.814 --> 18:11.349
<i>AGH!</i>

18:11.349 --> 18:13.150
WHAT THE HELL?
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A GAME.

18:13.150 --> 18:14.685
RICKY'S FATHER
CAME TO SEE ME.

18:14.685 --> 18:16.887
YEAH, I KNOW. MOM SAID.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.089
DID YOU DO IT?

18:19.023 --> 18:20.024
NO!

18:20.024 --> 18:21.392
I DIDN'T DO IT!

18:21.392 --> 18:23.627
I MEAN, RICKY'S GOT
LIKE A MILLION ENEMIES.

18:23.627 --> 18:25.029
YOU BETTER NOT
BE LYING TO ME.

18:25.029 --> 18:27.398
WHY? 'CAUSE YOU NEVER LIE?

18:27.398 --> 18:29.700
I MEAN, YOU'RE NEVER HOME.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.469
IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T EVEN
LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

18:35.106 --> 18:37.775
I SLEEP LESS,
BUT I HAVE MORE ENERGY.

18:37.775 --> 18:40.644
COLORS ARE BRIGHTER.
EVERYTHING IS CLEARER.

18:40.644 --> 18:42.313
IT'S LIKE...

18:42.313 --> 18:43.748
I CAN FINALLY SEE,

18:43.748 --> 18:46.183
AND I DON'T EVER REMEMBER
FEELING THIS WAY.

18:46.183 --> 18:47.518
NOT EVEN WITH DREW?

18:47.518 --> 18:49.186
WITH DREW,
IT WAS DIFFERENT.

18:49.186 --> 18:51.222
IT WAS --
IT WAS NEVER LIKE THIS.

18:51.222 --> 18:54.191
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH HIS MARRIAGE?

18:54.191 --> 18:56.627
I MEAN, DOES HE EVER TALK
ABOUT HIS WIFE?

18:59.930 --> 19:04.001
WELL, IT'S LIKE
WE'VE BEEN LIVING IN A --

19:04.001 --> 19:06.137
A BUBBLE.

19:06.137 --> 19:09.340
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT.

19:13.811 --> 19:14.845
T.J.

19:15.846 --> 19:19.049
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
COMING BACK TO THE OFFICE.

19:19.049 --> 19:21.652
NO, DAD, I --

19:21.652 --> 19:24.722
I WORK HERE NOW.
I TOLD YOU.

19:24.722 --> 19:26.724
T.J., GET IN THE CAR.

19:26.724 --> 19:29.126
BUT I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY JOB.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.630
THIS ISN'T A JOB.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.231
YES, IT IS!

19:34.231 --> 19:37.835
I'M FIXING
A BROKEN SPRING.

19:37.835 --> 19:39.537
WHY DO YOU THINK
THEY WANT YOU HERE?

19:39.537 --> 19:43.007
BECAUSE I KNOW ABOUT THIS STUFF,
AND I'M GOOD AT IT.

19:43.007 --> 19:45.209
NO, BECAUSE YOU COME
FROM MONEY.

19:45.209 --> 19:46.811
<i>THAT'S</i> WHAT THEY WANT.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.612
THEY'RE JUST USING YOU.

19:48.612 --> 19:50.948
Y-YEAH,
TO REPLACE A FRONT SUSPENSION.

19:50.948 --> 19:53.484
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!

19:55.319 --> 19:59.290
LOOK, SON, I-I JUST DON'T
WANT TO SEE YOU GET HURT.

19:59.290 --> 20:00.624
THAT'S ALL.

20:00.624 --> 20:02.226
NOW, COME ON.

20:02.226 --> 20:06.397
NO, I-I-I HAVE TO ALIGN IT
AFTER I REPAIR IT.

20:06.397 --> 20:08.332
T.J., USE YOUR HEAD.

20:08.332 --> 20:11.402
OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN CHICAGO
WHO CAN FIX A CAR,

20:11.402 --> 20:13.504
WHY DO YOU THINK
THEY WOULD HIRE YOU?!

20:25.182 --> 20:27.084
GET IN THE CAR.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.273
DO YOU EVER FEEL

20:49.273 --> 20:51.642
WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH
ABOUT EACH OTHER?

20:51.642 --> 20:53.777
MM, NO, I THINK
I'VE DONE A PRETTY THOROUGH,

20:53.777 --> 20:55.112
HEAD-TO-TOE EXAMINATION OF --

20:55.112 --> 20:56.847
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

20:56.847 --> 21:00.117
YOU HAVE A WHOLE LIFE, A HOME.
I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

21:02.653 --> 21:06.056
I CAN'T ALWAYS PRETEND
I'M A NYMPHOMANIAC FROM LISBON.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.393
OKAY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

21:09.393 --> 21:11.295
YOUR DAUGHTER.
WHAT'S SHE INTO?

21:11.295 --> 21:13.964
UH, FOLK MUSIC
WITH LOTS OF SHOUTING.

21:14.965 --> 21:16.166
LESBIAN COMPUTER NERDS.

21:16.166 --> 21:19.136
WELL, SHE SOUNDS COOL.

21:19.136 --> 21:21.672
AND YOUR SON?

21:21.672 --> 21:24.842
OH, VIC -- HE'S GOING THROUGH
A BIT OF A ROUGH TIME.

21:24.842 --> 21:26.343
UH, WE'RE WORKING
THROUGH IT.

21:26.343 --> 21:30.447
TEENAGERS.

21:30.447 --> 21:31.749
AND ELAINE?

21:35.019 --> 21:36.720
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT ELAINE?

21:36.720 --> 21:38.188
YEAH, I DO.

21:40.457 --> 21:42.426
UM...

21:42.426 --> 21:45.796
OKAY, WELL, SHE'S

21:45.796 --> 21:47.898
SHE'S STRONG, SMART.

21:47.898 --> 21:51.035
UM, SHE'S A GREAT MOTHER.

21:51.035 --> 21:52.536
UM...

21:52.536 --> 21:53.604
SHE HAS A-A RESTAURANT

21:53.604 --> 21:55.973
THAT SHE'S DOING
REALLY WELL WITH.

21:55.973 --> 21:58.409
SHE, UH, SHE GARDENS,
RIGHT?

21:58.409 --> 22:00.444
TURNIPS AND TOMATOES?

22:02.146 --> 22:03.180
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

22:03.180 --> 22:06.050
UH, DREW.

22:06.050 --> 22:07.585
HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE CASE.

22:07.585 --> 22:10.020
WHY WAS DREW TALKING
ABOUT MY WIFE?

22:13.190 --> 22:14.725
I DON'T KNOW.

22:14.725 --> 22:16.694
UM...

22:16.694 --> 22:17.795
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID
ANYTHING.

22:17.795 --> 22:20.931
NO. I DON'T THINK I LIKE
THIS GAME.

22:23.867 --> 22:25.202
KEEP AN EYE ON T.J.

22:25.202 --> 22:27.171
I DON'T WANT HIM
GOING BACK TO THAT GARAGE.

22:27.171 --> 22:29.440
I'M ON IT.

22:29.440 --> 22:32.977
JACK, THAT LITTLE SNAFU
WITH THE SOLAR PANELS

22:32.977 --> 22:34.445
IS COSTING ME
$20,000 A DAY.

22:34.445 --> 22:36.213
GOT ANY IDEAS?

22:39.950 --> 22:41.251
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

22:41.251 --> 22:45.255
GO TO THAT PROSECUTOR,
RAID HIS HOUSE. RIGHT, JACK?

22:52.062 --> 22:54.765
THERE YOU GO.
PROBLEM SOLVED.

23:37.429 --> 23:41.266
NUMBER SEVEN WITH THE PIGTAILS.
SHE'S YOURS, RIGHT?

23:41.266 --> 23:43.168
AMY?

23:43.168 --> 23:45.203
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

23:45.203 --> 23:46.805
I LOVE SOCCER.

23:46.805 --> 23:49.341
GO, GO, GO, GO!

23:49.341 --> 23:50.842
I ALREADY DID YOU A FAVOR.

23:50.842 --> 23:52.844
THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME
I ASK.

23:52.844 --> 23:54.646
THEY WILL KILL ME.

23:54.646 --> 23:56.348
WE CAN PROTECT YOU.

23:56.348 --> 23:57.482
WE CAN ENSURE YOUR SAFETY.

23:57.482 --> 23:58.917
NO. I'M DONE.

23:58.917 --> 24:00.619
LOOK.

24:00.619 --> 24:01.920
IF YOU HELP US WITH THIS,

24:01.920 --> 24:03.455
WE CAN PUT KARSTEN
AWAY FOR GOOD,

24:03.455 --> 24:06.725
AND HE WON'T EVER
BE ABLE TO HURT YOU.

24:06.725 --> 24:08.460
MEN LIKE YOU.

24:08.460 --> 24:11.763
YOU WANT WHAT YOU WANT,
LIKE MY CLIENTS,

24:11.763 --> 24:15.167
ONLY THEY DON'T PRETEND
TO BE ANYTHING.

24:15.167 --> 24:17.035
BUT YOU --
YOU PRETEND TO BE GOOD.

24:18.804 --> 24:20.605
I'LL TAKE AN HONEST THIEF
ANY DAY.

24:24.876 --> 24:27.112
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY,
YOU TWO.

24:27.112 --> 24:28.647
DMITRI, TABLE 24 IS READY
FOR DESSERT,

24:28.647 --> 24:31.450
BUT YOU NEED TO CRUMB
THAT TABLE FIRST, PLEASE.

24:31.450 --> 24:32.951
OH, ROMY, THAT REMINDS ME,

24:32.951 --> 24:35.520
I PACKED THAT CHOCOLATE CAKE
FOR YOUR MOM'S BIRTHDAY.

24:35.520 --> 24:37.589
AND NOW YOUR PRESENT'S
BETTER THAN MINE.

24:39.358 --> 24:41.059
OH, EXCUSE ME.

24:41.059 --> 24:42.761
WOULD YOU MIND
GIVING THAT A TRY?

24:42.761 --> 24:45.197
IT'S NOT ON THE MENU YET.

24:45.197 --> 24:48.667
UH, SURE.
I-I DON'T MIND.

24:48.667 --> 24:50.469
THANKS, BUT PROMISE ME
YOU'LL BE HONEST.

24:59.144 --> 25:00.645
IT'S DELICIOUS.

25:00.645 --> 25:02.381
YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

25:02.381 --> 25:03.882
NO, IT'S GOOD.

25:03.882 --> 25:05.951
NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIE
JUST TO BE NICE.

25:05.951 --> 25:07.819
ISN'T IT CRAZY
HOW WOMEN ALWAYS DO THAT?

25:09.354 --> 25:10.889
YEAH, IT REALLY IS.

25:10.889 --> 25:13.492
I WONDER IF MAYBE IT NEEDS
A LITTLE CILANTRO.

25:13.492 --> 25:17.362
HONESTLY, I HAVE NO IDEA.
I CAN'T COOK.

25:17.362 --> 25:18.997
MY SON
EATS MAC AND CHEESE

25:18.997 --> 25:20.565
OUT OF THE BOX EVERY NIGHT,
SO...

25:21.700 --> 25:23.902
WELL, YOU KNOW
THAT COOKING IS JUST

25:23.902 --> 25:25.704
ABOUT PRACTICE
AND FAMILIARITY.

25:25.704 --> 25:27.706
MY MOTHER SPENT
HER LIFE IN THE KITCHEN,

25:27.706 --> 25:29.741
SO IF I WANTED TO TALK TO HER,
THAT'S WHERE I HAD TO GO.

25:29.741 --> 25:32.177
WELL,
MY MOTHER WAS A PERFECTIONIST.

25:32.177 --> 25:34.446
SHE HATED MESS,
SO THE KITCHEN WAS OFF-LIMITS.

25:34.446 --> 25:35.580
YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH?

25:35.580 --> 25:37.516
I MADE NUTRITIOUS MEALS
FOR MY KIDS

25:37.516 --> 25:38.917
FROM THE TIME
THAT THEY WERE VERY LITTLE,

25:38.917 --> 25:41.119
AND I REALLY DON'T THINK IT MADE
MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE AT ALL.

25:43.755 --> 25:45.590
HI. YOU'RE BACK SOON.

25:45.590 --> 25:48.160
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
I HAD TO BRING YOU

25:48.160 --> 25:49.928
THIS '09 SYRAH
FROM NAPA.

25:49.928 --> 25:51.563
OKAY.

25:51.563 --> 25:53.165
I HEARD IT HAS
A SMOOTH FINISH.

25:53.165 --> 25:54.933
YEAH, AND NICE LEGS.

25:56.935 --> 25:59.237
MAYBE WE SHOULD
GIVE IT A TASTE.
OKAY.

25:59.237 --> 26:00.572
I NEED TO GET GOING, SO --

26:00.572 --> 26:03.575
OH, I'M ELAINE, BY THE WAY.
I OWN THE PLACE.

26:03.575 --> 26:05.877
OH. SARA.

26:05.877 --> 26:07.712
YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.
HAVE WE MET?

26:07.712 --> 26:09.448
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

26:09.448 --> 26:10.882
WELL,
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU NOW.

26:10.882 --> 26:13.218
YEAH, YOU TOO.
BYE. BYE.

26:13.218 --> 26:15.387
HEY, LISTEN, IF YOU GET
THAT WHOLE-WHEAT MAC AND CHEESE

26:15.387 --> 26:17.489
AND YOU THROW IN EGG WHITES
AND CARROT PUREE,

26:17.489 --> 26:18.590
VOILà, HEALTHY MEAL.

26:18.590 --> 26:19.624
KIND OF.

26:19.624 --> 26:21.226
THANK YOU.

26:21.226 --> 26:22.928
OKAY.

26:25.964 --> 26:29.134
SNACK MOM.
IT'S A THANKLESS JOB.

26:29.134 --> 26:31.103
KIDS -- THEY WANT CANDY.
PARENTS WANT FRUIT.

26:32.604 --> 26:34.239
GET AWAY FROM MY CAR.

26:34.239 --> 26:36.575
YEAH,
I USED TO PLAY T-BALL HERE --

26:36.575 --> 26:39.744
WELL, BACK WHEN IT WAS A FIELD,
NOT A PARKING LOT.

26:39.744 --> 26:41.113
LET ME GET THAT FOR YOU.

26:42.114 --> 26:43.748
I GREW UP
OVER IN HUMBOLDT PARK.

26:43.748 --> 26:45.417
I USED TO SPEND
MY SUMMERS

26:45.417 --> 26:47.219
READING ALL DAY
AT THE PULASKI LIBRARY,

26:47.219 --> 26:49.287
THEN I'D GO OVER TO NEBBIE'S
WHERE MY MOM WORKED

26:49.287 --> 26:51.523
TO HELP HER SERVE RED-HOTS.

26:51.523 --> 26:53.391
YOU SEEM LIKE
A GOLD COAST KID.

26:53.391 --> 26:56.394
NOPE.
SINGLE MOM, FOUR KIDS.

26:56.394 --> 26:58.663
SHE STRUGGLED,
BUT SHE WAS TOUGH.

26:58.663 --> 27:00.165
LIKE YOU.

27:00.165 --> 27:01.700
WE GO TO NEBBIE'S
ALL THE TIME.

27:01.700 --> 27:03.835
MM.
KONSTANTINE IS STILL THERE.

27:03.835 --> 27:05.470
GOOD, OLD KONSTANTINE.

27:05.470 --> 27:07.339
YOU KNEW HIM?
YEAH, OF COURSE.

27:07.339 --> 27:09.941
'CAUSE THERE IS
NO KONSTANTINE THERE.

27:09.941 --> 27:12.978
NOT ONLY ARE YOU A LIAR,
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOOD AT IT.

27:15.113 --> 27:16.948
THE THING ABOUT MY FAMILY,
THAT'S ALL TRUE.

27:20.152 --> 27:22.687
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
LOOK.

27:22.687 --> 27:24.623
THERE IS ONE THING
THAT I CARE ABOUT,

27:24.623 --> 27:25.957
ONE THING I NEED,
AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

27:25.957 --> 27:27.993
WELL, I CAN'T HELP YOU!
WHY NOT?

27:27.993 --> 27:30.495
WHY ARE YOU GONNA LET KARSTEN
USE YOU LIKE THIS?

27:30.495 --> 27:32.531
WHAT, I SHOULD BE YOUR PAWN
INSTEAD OF HIS?

27:35.534 --> 27:36.735
YOU GOT TO HAVE DREAMS,
RIGHT?

27:36.735 --> 27:39.504
SOMETHING YOU ASPIRE TO.

27:39.504 --> 27:43.175
HAVEN'T YOU EVER
WANTED ANYTHING THAT BADLY?

27:48.680 --> 27:51.216
YEAH, I WANT THINGS.

27:58.390 --> 28:00.158
A PLACE IN A GOOD
SCHOOL DISTRICT,

28:00.158 --> 28:02.394
MY RECORD CLEANED,
A GREEN CARD.

28:02.394 --> 28:04.095
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

28:05.697 --> 28:08.433
YOU MAKE ME AN AMERICAN,
I'LL BE WHATEVER YOU WANT.

28:17.209 --> 28:19.444
WHOO!

28:22.881 --> 28:24.115
YOU DID SUCH A GOOD JOB.

28:24.115 --> 28:25.116
THANK YOU.

28:25.116 --> 28:27.686
YES, AND YOU WERE RUNNING
SO FAST.

28:31.486 --> 28:33.088
SO, THEY'RE NOT GONNA USE
THE PHOTOS?

28:33.088 --> 28:35.224
NO, BUT ALISSA'S SENDING THEM
TO<i> THE NEW YORK TIMES.</i>

28:35.224 --> 28:39.159
WOW.
THAT WOULD BE A STEP UP.

28:39.159 --> 28:41.962
STANDING UP TO JANET LIKE THAT
COULD HAVE BEEN A DISASTER,

28:41.962 --> 28:43.230
BUT IT FELT KIND OF GOOD.

28:43.230 --> 28:45.465
MIGHT EVEN
WORK OUT BETTER IN THE END.

28:45.465 --> 28:47.450
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS TIE?

28:47.450 --> 28:48.651
IT'S FINE.

28:48.651 --> 28:51.223
YOU LOOK PRETTY, MOMMY.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

28:51.223 --> 28:52.991
MY BOSS' RETIREMENT PARTY.

28:56.061 --> 28:58.597
OLIVER,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:58.597 --> 28:59.932
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:59.932 --> 29:02.267
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

29:07.172 --> 29:08.340
HERE IT COMES!

29:08.340 --> 29:09.741
I'M NOT DONE!

29:15.113 --> 29:18.951
LARRY, YOU ARE
TOTALLY IRREPLACEABLE.

29:18.951 --> 29:20.218
THAT BEING SAID,

29:20.218 --> 29:22.187
I AM ON THE LIST OF PEOPLE
TO REPLACE YOU, RIGHT?

29:22.187 --> 29:24.056
HOW CLOSE
TO THE TOP OF THAT LIST AM I?

29:24.056 --> 29:25.791
CLOSER THAN YOU WERE
YESTERDAY.

29:25.791 --> 29:28.827
YOU GOT BRANDY KORSKAYA
TO THANK FOR THAT.

29:28.827 --> 29:30.462
SHE'S GONNA
DRIVE THIS THING HOME.

29:30.462 --> 29:31.630
HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:31.630 --> 29:33.265
I KNOW I'M RIGHT

29:33.265 --> 29:34.833
'CAUSE I'M GONNA PUT HER
IN TRAINING FIRST.

29:34.833 --> 29:36.234
THAT'S A CHANGE.

29:36.234 --> 29:39.338
UH, SHE'S NOT AS READY
AS I THOUGHT, AND...

29:39.338 --> 29:41.640
SHE'S GOT THIS LITTLE KID.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.342
NO REASON
TO PULL THE TRIGGER TONIGHT.

29:43.342 --> 29:45.944
THERE HE IS --
THE LAST GOOD MAN!

29:45.944 --> 29:49.047
CONGRATULATIONS, LARRY.

29:49.047 --> 29:51.316
I HEAR YOU'RE TAKING
YOUR WIFE TO RIO.

29:51.316 --> 29:52.684
10-DAY CRUISE.

29:52.684 --> 29:53.785
GOOD FOR YOU.

29:53.785 --> 29:55.754
I LOVE THIS SONG.

29:55.754 --> 29:57.289
WE'RE DANCING, LARRY.

30:07.466 --> 30:09.935
YOU LOOK GREAT TONIGHT.

30:09.935 --> 30:11.136
YOU SEEM GOOD LATELY.

30:11.136 --> 30:13.171
HAPPY.

30:13.171 --> 30:14.940
YEAH, I GUESS I HAVE BEEN.

30:16.141 --> 30:19.344
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE WE'VE DONE THIS.

30:19.344 --> 30:20.512
WHAT, DANCE?

30:20.512 --> 30:21.880
GONE OUT.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.149
HAD A GOOD TIME TOGETHER.

30:24.149 --> 30:26.284
LET'S TRY AND MAKE IT HAPPEN
MORE OFTEN.

30:26.284 --> 30:28.120
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE NICE.

30:43.468 --> 30:45.370
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THIS MORNING.

30:45.370 --> 30:47.873
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE
OR WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

30:47.873 --> 30:50.776
AGH!

30:55.681 --> 30:57.315
OHH!

30:58.483 --> 31:00.485
OKAY. OKAY.

31:00.485 --> 31:01.486
THAT'S ENOUGH.

31:01.486 --> 31:03.555
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

31:03.555 --> 31:06.558
LOOK I HOPE
RICKY'S FEELING BETTER.

31:06.558 --> 31:08.760
THIS SHOULD COVER
YOUR EXPENSES.

31:08.760 --> 31:09.928
HEY, MY SON IS IN HERE

31:09.928 --> 31:11.830
DRINKING HIS DINNER
THROUGH A STRAW!

31:11.830 --> 31:13.565
I AIN'T TAKING
YOUR BLOOD MONEY!

31:13.565 --> 31:15.333
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE, MAN!

31:15.333 --> 31:17.302
YOU'RE THATCHER KARSTEN'S
BITCH!

31:19.371 --> 31:22.174
DON'T COME BACK HERE
AGAIN!

31:29.381 --> 31:31.283
OUR WARRANT DIES
IN 15 HOURS.

31:31.283 --> 31:32.317
WE'LL GET ANOTHER ONE.

31:32.317 --> 31:34.386
THE WHOLE POINT --
SHE'S NOT READY.

31:34.386 --> 31:36.354
I SEE THAT NOW.
THANK YOU.

31:36.354 --> 31:38.457
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

31:38.457 --> 31:40.759
WHAT HAPPENED?

31:40.759 --> 31:43.995
THIS GIRL GOT TO YOU,
DIDN'T SHE?

31:43.995 --> 31:46.598
WHAT WE ARE ASKING HER TO DO
IS DANGEROUS.

31:46.598 --> 31:47.999
I DON'T WANT TO RUSH
INTO ANYTHING.

32:21.233 --> 32:23.034
THANKS, GUYS.
THANK YOU.

32:31.276 --> 32:32.477
YEAH!

32:32.477 --> 32:33.478
OH, YEAH!

32:33.478 --> 32:35.580
THANKS, GUYS. THANK YOU.

32:35.580 --> 32:37.115
THANKS A LOT.
THANK YOU ALL.

33:17.222 --> 33:18.990
SARA.

33:18.990 --> 33:21.059
SARA, WHAT'S WRONG?!
WHAT -- WHAT IS IT?

33:21.059 --> 33:22.861
HEY.

33:22.861 --> 33:24.329
HEY.

33:25.831 --> 33:30.168
WHAT -- WHAT -- WHAT IS IT?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

33:30.168 --> 33:31.503
I WANT TO GO.

33:31.503 --> 33:33.171
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME,
OKAY?

33:33.171 --> 33:34.172
WHAT? WHAT?

33:34.172 --> 33:35.340
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.
OKAY.

33:35.340 --> 33:36.441
I WANT TO GO HOME.
OKAY.

33:36.441 --> 33:37.442
I WANT TO GO HOME.
ALL RIGHT.

33:37.442 --> 33:38.743
WANT TO GO HOME.
WE'LL GO HOME, BABY.

33:38.743 --> 33:39.878
WE'LL GO HOME.
WANT TO GO HOME.
WANT TO GO HOME.

33:44.631 --> 33:47.152
NEVER KNEW SO MUCH COULD COME
OUT OF SUCH A LITTLE PERSON.

33:48.286 --> 33:49.621
TAKE BLUE BEAR, MOMMY.

33:49.621 --> 33:51.156
OH, THANKS, LOVE BUG.

33:51.156 --> 33:52.357
I'LL BE FINE, OKAY?

33:52.357 --> 33:54.876
YOU JUST GO BACK TO BED,
OKAY?

33:54.876 --> 33:56.511
SO, NIGHT-NIGHT.

33:56.511 --> 33:58.080
OKAY.

34:02.918 --> 34:05.754
I'LL GO GET YOU SOME WATER.
THANKS.

34:30.746 --> 34:32.047
THERE YOU GO.

34:33.382 --> 34:34.883
THANKS.

34:34.883 --> 34:37.452
I LOVE YOU, BABE.

34:40.856 --> 34:43.658
OH, THANKS FOR TAKING
SUCH GOOD CARE OF ME.

34:54.336 --> 34:57.806
DAMN. WHAT HAPPENED?

35:00.142 --> 35:01.971
I WENT TO VISIT
RICKY'S FATHER.

35:12.881 --> 35:16.919
YOU COULD HAVE
A LIFE FULL OF...

35:16.919 --> 35:19.054
LYING AND CHEATING
AND GUILT.

35:19.054 --> 35:22.558
YOU COULD LOOK LIKE
A GOOD PERSON,

35:22.558 --> 35:25.961
AND YOU COULD FOOL EVERYBODY.

35:25.961 --> 35:29.031
YOU COULD GET SO GOOD
AT DECEIVING PEOPLE

35:29.031 --> 35:31.033
THAT YOU'D NEVER GET CAUGHT.

35:33.235 --> 35:34.737
BUT YOU WOULD KNOW.

35:37.139 --> 35:38.641
AND YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE

35:38.641 --> 35:40.843
TO LOOK AT YOURSELF
IN THE MIRROR.

35:43.646 --> 35:46.348
AND I DON'T WANT THAT LIFE
FOR YOU.

35:56.625 --> 35:57.793
YOU'RE GROUNDED.

35:57.793 --> 36:01.864
YOU CAN USE THE KITCHEN COMPUTER
FOR SCHOOL.

36:07.336 --> 36:08.671
WHEN DO I GET MY STUFF BACK?

36:10.139 --> 36:11.507
WHEN YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH.

36:13.242 --> 36:15.577
HEY, VIC, I --

36:15.577 --> 36:18.180
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR FACE?

36:21.583 --> 36:24.987
JACK. WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:24.987 --> 36:26.588
HUH? LET ME SEE THIS.
WHERE WERE YOU?

36:26.588 --> 36:28.457
I WENT TO SEE
THE KID'S FATHER --

36:28.457 --> 36:30.192
THE KID THAT VIC PUT
IN THE HOSPITAL.

36:30.192 --> 36:32.328
JACK, WE DON'T KNOW
THAT VIC PUT THAT KID --

36:32.328 --> 36:34.530
WE KNOW. COME ON.

36:34.530 --> 36:36.065
WE KNOW.

36:37.199 --> 36:39.001
WHY WOULD YOU
GO TO SEE HIM?

36:40.169 --> 36:41.170
TO FIX IT.

36:41.170 --> 36:43.105
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

36:43.105 --> 36:45.240
I FIX THINGS.

36:45.240 --> 36:47.710
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

36:47.710 --> 36:50.079
GOT TO GO CLEAN THE YARD.

37:01.757 --> 37:03.659
BABE,
WHERE'S YOUR CAMERA?

37:03.659 --> 37:05.761
I WANT TO SEE THOSE PICTURES
OLIVER TOOK.

37:05.761 --> 37:09.598
UH...
ON THE DRESSER.

37:10.966 --> 37:12.801
DREW SAID
IT WOULD BE NEXT WEEK.

37:12.801 --> 37:14.269
CHANGE OF PLAN.

37:14.269 --> 37:17.373
NOW,
IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG,

37:17.373 --> 37:19.174
SLIP THE WORD "FRIDAY"
INTO THE CONVERSATION,

37:19.174 --> 37:20.476
AND WE'LL GET YOU OUT.

37:28.684 --> 37:31.153
WE WON'T LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO YOU.

37:36.392 --> 37:39.528
SORRY.

37:39.528 --> 37:40.829
HEY.

37:43.198 --> 37:45.501
I'M SORRY I --

37:45.501 --> 37:48.003
I TOOK THIS BY ACCIDENT.

37:48.003 --> 37:50.739
AND I'M SORRY I LEFT
IN THE MIDDLE OF MY SHIFT.

37:50.739 --> 37:51.807
WHATEVER, MAN.

37:51.807 --> 37:53.575
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D BE SIPPING CRISTAL

37:53.575 --> 37:55.344
AND SAILING AROUND
ON MY YACHT.

37:55.344 --> 37:58.447
JUST DO WHATEVER
YOU GOT TO DO, MAN.

37:59.882 --> 38:03.018
RODNEY, I-I CAN TELL
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON.

38:03.018 --> 38:05.287
I-I TRUST YOU.

38:05.287 --> 38:07.222
YOU KNOW,
I-I PROMISE YOU

38:07.222 --> 38:10.025
I-I'LL BE HERE
EVERY DAY ON TIME,

38:10.025 --> 38:12.928
READY TO WORK
IF YOU'LL STILL LET ME.

38:12.928 --> 38:14.396
WHAT ABOUT YOUR OLD MAN?

38:14.396 --> 38:17.266
HE DIDN'T SEEM
TO WANT YOU HANGING AROUND HERE.

38:17.266 --> 38:18.834
NO.

38:18.834 --> 38:21.804
BUT I'M NOT GONNA LET HIM
TELL ME WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

38:23.839 --> 38:25.240
LET'S GO GET YOU A LOCKER.

38:50.232 --> 38:51.733
HELLO, BRANDY.

38:53.001 --> 38:55.170
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU
SO LATE.

38:55.170 --> 38:57.473
IT'S OKAY.

38:57.473 --> 38:59.608
I ASSUMED WHEN YOU CALLED,

38:59.608 --> 39:01.176
YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT
IT WAS IMPORTANT.

39:03.345 --> 39:04.913
PLEASE.

39:04.913 --> 39:06.081
WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK?

39:06.081 --> 39:08.417
NO, THANK YOU.

39:11.119 --> 39:12.788
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

39:14.556 --> 39:17.192
THINGS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE SLOW,
MR. KARSTEN.

39:17.192 --> 39:19.361
I-I LOST A DAY OF WORK

39:19.361 --> 39:21.263
GIVING MY STATEMENT
TO THE POLICE, AND --

39:21.263 --> 39:22.531
WHAT STATEMENT WAS THAT?

39:24.233 --> 39:27.503
THE ONE SAYING I WAS WITH T.J.
THE NIGHT OF LOU'S MURDER.

39:29.505 --> 39:31.406
NOW THE PROSECUTOR
IS THREATENING TO --

39:31.406 --> 39:34.042
TO DEPORT ME
AND TAKE AWAY MY DAUGHTER.

39:34.042 --> 39:38.280
I'M UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE.

39:38.280 --> 39:41.383
I'M VERY SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

39:44.653 --> 39:46.255
SO...

39:46.255 --> 39:47.956
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

39:50.726 --> 39:51.927
I NEED MORE MONEY

39:51.927 --> 39:55.097
FOR BEING T.J.'s ALIBI.

39:55.097 --> 39:56.698
HOW ARE THINGS AT THE CLUB?

39:56.698 --> 40:00.235
AND YOUR DAUGHTER.
WHAT'S HER NAME?

40:00.235 --> 40:02.437
AMY.

40:02.437 --> 40:04.206
LOOK, MR. KARSTEN, I --

40:04.206 --> 40:06.542
WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING
FOR ME?

40:08.544 --> 40:09.678
WHAT?

40:09.678 --> 40:12.915
TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF.

40:15.717 --> 40:18.186
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

40:18.186 --> 40:19.988
ISN'T THAT WHAT MEN
PAY YOU TO DO?

42:15.971 --> 42:18.306
NICE PHOTOS.
