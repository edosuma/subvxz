WEBVTT

00:03.369 --> 00:04.736
Super-hot blonde, heart of ice,

00:04.737 --> 00:06.204
yeah, it's Chuck's ex, Sarah.

00:06.205 --> 00:07.372
What's their deal?

00:07.373 --> 00:09.273
Turns out I haven't been
completely honest.

00:09.308 --> 00:12.827
The truth is, I was
hitting on you.

00:12.895 --> 00:14.191
<i>It was completely
unprofessional,</i>

00:14.192 --> 00:16.091
<i>and I apologize.</i>

00:16.105 --> 00:18.111
Oh, my God.

00:19.399 --> 00:21.299
Chuck has a secret girlfriend.

00:28.431 --> 00:30.939
I can't believe that Chuck
is sneaking around

00:31.008 --> 00:32.744
my back like this,
living this other life

00:32.744 --> 00:35.057
that he doesn't think
I know anything about.

00:35.125 --> 00:37.566
I guess he'll tell you about
Hannah when he's ready, hon.

00:37.634 --> 00:41.249
Hannah- you've said it a
hundred times before so casual.

00:41.317 --> 00:43.957
Hannah. Chuck had asked
me to keep it a secret.

00:44.024 --> 00:45.296
You know, maybe it's me.

00:45.297 --> 00:46.700
Maybe he thinks, like,

00:46.701 --> 00:48.140
I'll judge him
or something.

00:48.141 --> 00:50.481
I mean, he told me about the
first girl he had a crush on-

00:50.548 --> 00:51.618
Mrs. Seaver.

00:51.619 --> 00:52.621
Who?

00:52.622 --> 00:54.160
<i>The mom from Growing Pains.</i>

00:54.161 --> 00:56.500
And-and you,
you used to tell me

00:56.567 --> 00:58.372
everything, too,
and now you and my brother

00:58.373 --> 00:59.842
are as thick as thieves.

00:59.843 --> 01:01.513
Is there something you're
keeping from me, too?

01:01.514 --> 01:03.352
Any secrets?
No, nothing, not a thing.

01:03.353 --> 01:04.721
You're lying.

01:04.723 --> 01:06.626
I'm not lying.

01:06.693 --> 01:07.828
Your pulse is racing.

01:07.829 --> 01:08.931
I'm exercising.

01:08.932 --> 01:10.101
Honey, go to Chuck.

01:10.102 --> 01:12.274
Tell him how feel. Be honest.

01:12.342 --> 01:14.481
That's good advice, honey.

01:14.549 --> 01:16.646
I love you.

01:19.787 --> 01:21.687
<i>Chuck?</i>

01:22.961 --> 01:24.861
Chuck?

01:25.634 --> 01:27.404
Chuck, listen, uh,

01:27.405 --> 01:28.739
I get it.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.478
You know, I'm not the one
that you...

01:30.479 --> 01:33.416
share everything with anymore.

01:33.484 --> 01:37.658
I just- I just miss
being that person.

01:37.725 --> 01:40.062
Everybody knew about this
new girl that you're dating

01:40.131 --> 01:43.135
before I did.

01:43.203 --> 01:44.738
I just wanted to let you know

01:44.739 --> 01:46.639
that I'm a really good
secret keeper.

01:46.676 --> 01:50.615
And if you don't want Sarah
to know about the new girl...

01:50.683 --> 01:52.919
I won't tell Sarah if you don't.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.723
Um, I'm Hannah.

01:57.161 --> 02:00.433
Oh, my God, this is
so embarrassing. No.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074

02:10.185 --> 02:13.989
Ellie... uh... my sister.

02:14.057 --> 02:17.262
I've been meaning
to introduce you to...

02:18.231 --> 02:19.732
...Hannah. Hannah-

02:19.733 --> 02:22.870
who apparently you've already
just met right now. Mm-hmm.

02:22.938 --> 02:24.673
Hannah is...

02:24.674 --> 02:26.242
a girl.

02:26.243 --> 02:27.244
She's a girl...

02:27.245 --> 02:28.245
and a friend.

02:28.246 --> 02:29.814
A very close friend.

02:29.815 --> 02:32.151
Technically as close as two
people can kind of... Okay.

02:32.219 --> 02:34.455
Doughnut?
No, thanks.

02:34.522 --> 02:38.026
Um, I need to go and get dressed
so I can go to work.

02:38.094 --> 02:41.331
It was, uh... it was really
great to meet you, Ellie.

02:41.399 --> 02:42.800
Likewise.

02:42.801 --> 02:45.170
Okay. Bye. Bye.

02:48.509 --> 02:50.244
I am- I am so sorry.

02:50.245 --> 02:51.513
I just... I don't know,

02:51.514 --> 02:53.382
I felt like I was
out of the loop,

02:53.383 --> 02:55.252
and you used to tell
me everything, and...

02:55.253 --> 02:57.153
I know. I'm sorry. You
shouldn't be sorry, I'm sorry.

02:57.189 --> 02:58.557
I wanted to tell you.

02:58.558 --> 03:01.227
I've just been really
wrapped up at work, and...

03:01.295 --> 03:03.130
But I have an idea.

03:03.131 --> 03:06.635
I'm going to make dinner
for the four of us tonight.

03:06.703 --> 03:08.638
And guess what, it's
going to be your favorite.

03:08.705 --> 03:09.939
Oh, yeah.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.877
My famous chicken pepperoni.

03:12.944 --> 03:15.447
Huh? Oh, I got to
tell you the truth.

03:16.516 --> 03:18.985
I love...,

03:19.053 --> 03:20.320
your chicken pepperoni.

03:20.321 --> 03:22.690
Yes, I know this.

03:22.757 --> 03:24.058
Really, I'm just-

03:24.059 --> 03:25.959
I'm so glad that you're
moving on from Sarah.

03:32.738 --> 03:34.072
I thought
you didn't want dessert.

03:34.073 --> 03:36.476
I don't.

03:36.543 --> 03:37.844
I want yours.

03:37.845 --> 03:41.349
See, my dessert is contained
within your dessert.

03:41.417 --> 03:43.118
Listen, Shaw...

03:43.119 --> 03:44.687
I like that.

03:44.688 --> 03:47.523
Keep it a last-name
basis. Impersonal.

03:47.591 --> 03:49.225
Very sexy, Walker.

03:49.226 --> 03:52.362
I don't think we should see each
other in a non-work capacity.

03:52.430 --> 03:54.330
Oh, is that what this is?

04:00.841 --> 04:03.009
Look, I-it's just,
it's becoming

04:03.077 --> 04:06.079
a pattern for me to get involved
with the guys that I work with,

04:06.147 --> 04:09.083
and I really need to put a stop
to that before it starts.

04:09.151 --> 04:11.751
So, this is a
preemptive breakup?

04:11.819 --> 04:14.286
I need to stop mixing
my personal life

04:14.353 --> 04:16.253
with my professional life.

04:19.824 --> 04:23.226
I'd be a liar if I didn't say
I was disappointed,

04:23.293 --> 04:25.260
but I get it.

04:28.497 --> 04:30.399
The vehicle in question
has arrived.

04:30.466 --> 04:32.366
Roger that.

04:44.379 --> 04:46.279
The man is on the move.

04:47.414 --> 04:49.314
I have the target in sight.

04:55.788 --> 04:57.522
Did you wear cologne
in my car?

04:57.523 --> 05:01.058
Nobody wants to smell you.

05:01.126 --> 05:03.360
The next time you wear
cologne in my car,

05:03.428 --> 05:05.328
I will end you.

05:06.164 --> 05:08.131
Night-night.

05:19.343 --> 05:22.345
Rafe Gruber is a martial arts
expert, a sharpshooter.

05:22.413 --> 05:24.947
He is one of five people
who can hit a target

05:25.015 --> 05:26.482
from half a mile away.

05:26.483 --> 05:28.116
I mean, the man
is a chameleon.

05:28.117 --> 05:31.019
It is a miracle we even
got a hit on his location.

05:31.086 --> 05:32.854
Very few people have
seen his face.

05:32.855 --> 05:34.355
Big deal, not impressed.

05:34.356 --> 05:36.256
Well, The Ring is.

05:36.324 --> 05:38.224
They wired a million dollars
into his account.

05:38.259 --> 05:40.360
Enemy of my enemy is
my friend, kind of thing.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.328
We need to know who
The Ring wants dead.

05:42.396 --> 05:44.997
There's nothing this clown
can do that I can't do.

05:45.065 --> 05:47.199
I'm perfect for this mission.

05:47.266 --> 05:49.501
Still, we're going
with Bartowski on this one.

05:49.568 --> 05:50.835
He'll assume Rafe's identity

05:50.836 --> 05:52.437
in order to learn
the Ring's target.

05:52.438 --> 05:55.306
The Intersect is performing.
He can do this. He's ready.

05:55.373 --> 05:56.874
Right, Walker?

05:56.875 --> 06:00.043
Chuck wants to be a spy.

06:00.111 --> 06:02.011
Hello, team Bartowski.

06:07.483 --> 06:10.851
Tempt anyone with
a tasty treat, huh?

06:12.220 --> 06:13.721
What's with him?

06:13.722 --> 06:15.623
Stallion had a date last night;
must have gotten lucky.

06:17.225 --> 06:19.026
So, what is going on?

06:19.027 --> 06:20.895
Who's this guy?

06:20.896 --> 06:22.796
That is Rafe Gruber.

06:30.603 --> 06:34.036
Wow, old Rafie boy's not such
a good guy now, is he?

06:34.104 --> 06:35.404
What are we doing with him?

06:35.405 --> 06:37.773
Not we, Chuck. You.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.040
You're about
to assume an alias.

06:39.041 --> 06:40.575
You're going to become

06:40.576 --> 06:42.476
the world's most
dangerous assassin.

06:42.911 --> 06:44.445
Becoming an alias, Chuck,

06:44.446 --> 06:46.347
is unlike anything you've had
in your spy training before.

06:46.415 --> 06:47.749
Under the most
stressful conditions,

06:47.750 --> 06:49.517
you have to react only
like Rafe, not Chuck.

06:49.518 --> 06:51.251
Guys, please.

06:51.252 --> 06:53.486
I think I know a thing
or two about acting, all right?

06:53.554 --> 06:55.454
I happened to play Perchik
in my high school's production

06:55.522 --> 06:57.156
<i>of Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

06:57.157 --> 06:58.757
And I was really quite good.

06:58.758 --> 07:00.458
Ow! Ow!

07:00.459 --> 07:02.459
What'd you do that for?!
I'm proving a point.

07:02.527 --> 07:04.427
Everything you think
and feel, Chuck,

07:04.462 --> 07:06.663
even your innate
reflexes have to change.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.464
The kind of people that
Gruber associates with

07:08.465 --> 07:10.432
will kill first,
ask questions later.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.367
Yeah, okay fine, I get it.
What's the plan?

07:12.368 --> 07:14.302
Well, Casey is going to elicit
the details from Gruber,

07:14.370 --> 07:16.638
whom he's meeting,
where and when.

07:16.706 --> 07:18.740
Then you'll go in
as Gruber, take his place.

07:18.807 --> 07:20.040
Well, good luck there.

07:20.041 --> 07:21.275
It's gonna be tough getting
information like that

07:21.276 --> 07:23.777
out of a top
assassin like Rafe.

07:23.845 --> 07:25.745
Nah, I can be
very persuasive.

07:39.791 --> 07:42.492
Hey, let me talk to him for
a second. Step off, Bartowski.

07:42.559 --> 07:44.427
I got a job to do.
Yeah, well, hey, so do I, okay?

07:44.428 --> 07:45.629
I've got to learn
about Rafe

07:45.630 --> 07:48.230
so I can get into
character for my mission.

07:48.298 --> 07:49.898
For example:

07:49.899 --> 07:52.867
Assassin is not normally
a booth one finds at Career Day.

07:52.935 --> 07:55.036
How'd you initially get
interested in this line of work?

07:55.103 --> 07:56.503
Why would I tell you anything?

07:56.504 --> 07:58.505
I can think of
one burning reason why.

07:58.573 --> 08:02.341
Okay. How about this one: What
was your most difficult hit?

08:02.409 --> 08:05.311
I'll take the torture over this
man's questions. Roger that.

08:05.378 --> 08:07.579
I'll take the torture
over this man's questions.

08:11.584 --> 08:13.484
Hey, it's just a phone.

08:17.255 --> 08:19.155
Gruber here.

08:19.491 --> 08:20.657
Of course I'm ready.

08:20.658 --> 08:22.558
Who do you think
you're dealing with?

08:23.661 --> 08:25.761
Yeah, yeah, I know
where that is.

08:25.829 --> 08:27.729
Across the street from
the cupcake place.

08:28.998 --> 08:31.032
Because I like
cupcakes, that's why.

08:31.099 --> 08:34.034
Who doesn't like
a good cupcake?

08:34.102 --> 08:36.303
I'll be there.

08:36.370 --> 08:38.471
Not bad, Bartowski.

08:38.539 --> 08:40.773
Who the hell is Bartowski?

08:44.474 --> 08:48.897
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

09:24.837 --> 09:26.839
Look at that guy.

09:26.906 --> 09:30.642
Chuck's the greatest lady
killer Burbank has ever seen.

09:30.710 --> 09:32.611
He's a real "chuck" magnet.

09:32.679 --> 09:34.446
Please with the puns.

09:34.447 --> 09:36.482
Terrible timing for my
number one employee Morgan

09:36.550 --> 09:38.651
to be away at
a leadership seminar.

09:38.718 --> 09:40.186
Due to a clerical oversight,
we received

09:40.187 --> 09:42.187
triple the number of Crock-Pots
I may have intended.

09:42.254 --> 09:44.222
I'm excited about
dinner tonight.

09:44.289 --> 09:46.489
Oh, yeah, yeah, me, too.

09:46.557 --> 09:47.823
What's that guy's secret
with women?

09:47.824 --> 09:49.990
What, has he got some kind
of deal with the devil?

09:50.058 --> 09:51.890
I've narrowed it down.

09:51.891 --> 09:54.825
Either mind controlling LSD
or sorcery.

09:54.893 --> 09:57.159
El Segundo School of Finance
has taught me

09:57.227 --> 10:00.229
when you try to sell a house,
bake some cookies.

10:00.297 --> 10:02.198
Make the place
smell familiar.

10:02.265 --> 10:03.766
We're gonna do
the same thing here.

10:03.767 --> 10:05.034
Except with gumbo.

10:05.035 --> 10:07.169
Folks smell something
cooking in that Crock-Pot,

10:07.236 --> 10:08.903
make them want to buy
the fool thing.

10:08.904 --> 10:10.939
Need a volunteer.

10:13.575 --> 10:15.842
You look like
you've peeled a few spuds

10:15.910 --> 10:17.410
in your day, Casey.

10:17.411 --> 10:19.145
And I would have picked you
if these two dipsticks

10:19.146 --> 10:20.146
hadn't been faking sick

10:20.147 --> 10:21.581
to get out of
chopping and dicing.

10:21.582 --> 10:24.483
Wash your filthy hands, boys.

10:29.155 --> 10:31.089
Hey, um, I'm cooking
dinner tonight

10:31.157 --> 10:32.991
for my family, Hannah,

10:32.992 --> 10:35.193
and my special chicken
pepperoni recipe

10:35.260 --> 10:36.393
takes a little time to prep,

10:36.394 --> 10:37.994
so I don't know how long
the mission is,

10:37.995 --> 10:39.596
but I need a hard
out by 5:00. Mm.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.164
I can give you a hard out
with these five.

10:41.165 --> 10:43.699
Get your priorities
straight.

10:46.235 --> 10:47.935
You okay in here?

10:47.936 --> 10:50.037
Yeah, yeah. I'll
be out in a sec.

10:56.510 --> 10:58.677
I see how that guy
looks at you.

11:02.214 --> 11:04.782
I bet he has no clue what to do
to a beautiful

11:04.850 --> 11:08.485
woman like you.

11:13.190 --> 11:15.090
But I do.

11:15.793 --> 11:17.894
I will take such good care
of you, sweetheart.

11:24.299 --> 11:26.333
All set.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.300
Quick thing I gotta do first.

11:42.882 --> 11:45.249
Okay, ready when you are.

11:48.086 --> 11:49.986
Hi.

11:52.789 --> 11:54.055
I miss those lips.

11:54.056 --> 11:56.056
What, these old things?

11:56.124 --> 11:57.691
I'm gonna be thinking
about last night

11:57.692 --> 11:59.626
when I'm on my install.

11:59.693 --> 12:01.093
What are you doing today?

12:01.094 --> 12:02.995
Yeah, same thing, install.

12:03.063 --> 12:04.729
Big, huge, complicated.

12:04.730 --> 12:06.297
Probably faking my way
through most of it.

12:06.298 --> 12:09.099
But hey, how about I come
and pick you up before dinner?

12:09.167 --> 12:11.067
That's great.

12:16.406 --> 12:20.275
Definitely a deal
with the devil.

12:20.343 --> 12:22.276
I am so lonely.

12:25.781 --> 12:27.681
Come on.

12:28.416 --> 12:31.219
I can pass for a cold-blooded
killer, right?

12:32.522 --> 12:34.422
What happened to Rafe?

12:38.493 --> 12:40.125
What?

12:40.126 --> 12:41.692
Imbecile can't go in alone.

12:41.693 --> 12:43.026
<i>Hey, where
am I going?</i>

12:43.027 --> 12:44.627
<i>Chuck, Rafe wasn't going</i>

12:44.628 --> 12:46.362
<i>to meet with your usual spies.</i>

12:46.363 --> 12:49.566
<i>These guys are a little more
old-fashioned.</i>

12:49.634 --> 12:52.135
<i>Heard a story this cugine
whacked this guy</i>

12:52.203 --> 12:53.469
during his spaghetti dinner.

12:53.470 --> 12:54.569
The coroner couldn't tell

12:54.570 --> 12:56.470
between the marinara
and the mess.

12:57.271 --> 12:58.972
Hey, boss,
someone to see you.

12:58.973 --> 13:01.942
Well, well, well,

13:02.010 --> 13:04.144
Rafe Gruber.

13:04.211 --> 13:05.945
Your reputation precedes you.

13:05.946 --> 13:08.080
This is my coworker.

13:08.148 --> 13:09.648
You may call
him John.

13:09.649 --> 13:10.650
How ya doin'?

13:10.651 --> 13:12.551
John doesn't talk much.

13:13.186 --> 13:15.054
I know you from somewhere?

13:15.055 --> 13:16.955
Doubt it.

13:17.724 --> 13:19.891
When we had previous dealings
with our mutual friends,

13:19.959 --> 13:23.627
you had more trepidation
about letting us I.D. you.

13:23.695 --> 13:26.462
Not many people have seen
my face and lived.

13:26.529 --> 13:28.429
Consider it an honor.

13:36.335 --> 13:38.069
Look, I'm not much
for foreplay,

13:38.070 --> 13:40.137
so forgive me
if I'm a little rude.

13:40.205 --> 13:41.305
Who's my target?

13:41.306 --> 13:43.840
No one thinks
this guy looks familiar?

13:45.009 --> 13:46.077
You got cousins in Philly?

13:46.078 --> 13:47.978
No.

13:48.147 --> 13:49.782
I'm a huge fan
of your work.

13:49.783 --> 13:51.218
Can I ask you
something?

13:51.219 --> 13:53.119
What was your toughest hit?

13:54.656 --> 13:55.923
You want to know
my toughest hit?

13:55.924 --> 13:57.824
Look, I was just asking.

13:57.892 --> 13:59.158
Yeah, take it
easy, boss.

13:59.159 --> 14:00.893
You shut your mouth!

14:00.894 --> 14:03.261
You think it's okay to ask
a guy you just met

14:03.328 --> 14:04.562
something personal like that?

14:04.563 --> 14:07.231
I really didn't mean
no disrespect, I swear.

14:24.413 --> 14:27.315
Your toughest assignment's
always your next one.

14:27.383 --> 14:29.850
You forget that, then you die.

14:32.753 --> 14:34.721
You okay, Walker?

14:34.788 --> 14:37.390
Yeah, yeah, it's
just this alias thing.

14:37.457 --> 14:38.891
It must be a lot
for Chuck.

14:38.892 --> 14:40.726
He's not a very
good liar.

14:40.727 --> 14:41.994
Listen to him.

14:41.995 --> 14:43.228
He's completely living the lie.

14:43.229 --> 14:45.397
I know, but he's not like
you and me.

14:45.464 --> 14:48.566
We're both used to living
somebody else's life.

14:48.634 --> 14:50.335
That's the job.

14:50.336 --> 14:53.437
Yeah, but where does
the job end?

14:53.505 --> 14:56.974
I can barely remember
who I am anymore.

14:57.041 --> 14:59.076
CHUCK I'm a busy guy,
so what's the name?

14:59.143 --> 15:02.345
Who do our mutual friends
want me to kill?

15:02.413 --> 15:04.146
The guy's name is...
I remember now!

15:04.147 --> 15:05.914
You look like this
hotshot sniper

15:05.915 --> 15:07.816
I served with a while back.

15:07.884 --> 15:09.317
Name Alex Coburn,

15:09.318 --> 15:11.218
ring a bell?

15:19.324 --> 15:21.391
What are you trying to say?

15:21.459 --> 15:24.727
Simple. This guy isn't
who he says he is.

15:24.795 --> 15:26.162
Maybe he's some kind of fed.

15:26.163 --> 15:27.397
Damn it!
Casey's been made.

15:27.398 --> 15:29.065
We need to get them
out of there.

15:29.066 --> 15:30.499
How are we supposed
to do that

15:30.500 --> 15:31.534
without getting
everybody else killed?

15:31.535 --> 15:32.901
We need that name, Walker.

15:32.902 --> 15:34.802
We need to know who
the Ring wants dead.

15:34.838 --> 15:38.239
Are you implying that this guy,
my guy, is a cop?

15:38.307 --> 15:40.174
That's exactly what I'm saying.

15:40.175 --> 15:42.076
So what does that say about you?

15:48.016 --> 15:50.016
If he's a cop...

15:51.018 --> 15:53.922
I'll kill him myself.

16:02.521 --> 16:03.685
Do him, Rafe!

16:03.686 --> 16:06.154
What are you
waiting for?

16:06.221 --> 16:07.654
Quit stalling.
Keep stalling, Chuck.

16:07.655 --> 16:08.655
We need more time.

16:08.656 --> 16:09.656
We're waiting for backup.

16:09.657 --> 16:10.656
Time's running out.

16:10.657 --> 16:12.557
Kill him.

16:16.531 --> 16:18.465
I'm not a murderer.

16:18.533 --> 16:19.767
I'm an assassin!

16:19.768 --> 16:20.834
What's the damn difference?

16:20.835 --> 16:22.735
What's the damn
difference?

16:22.771 --> 16:24.271
I don't kill because I like it.

16:24.272 --> 16:26.006
I kill because it's a means
to something.

16:26.007 --> 16:27.940
In this case,
information.

16:28.008 --> 16:30.342
Information that I wouldn't get
from a dead guy

16:30.410 --> 16:32.310
per your suggestion!

16:35.514 --> 16:38.815
Now you're gonna tell me,
who's your informant?

16:38.883 --> 16:40.050
Who's the leak?

16:40.051 --> 16:42.919
Why would I tell you anything?

16:44.121 --> 16:45.121
Sell it.

16:45.122 --> 16:46.389
Wait!

16:46.390 --> 16:48.790
I got something

16:48.858 --> 16:50.758
special for occasions
such as these.

16:55.730 --> 16:59.032
Is this stuff sterile?

17:00.201 --> 17:01.467
I take pride

17:01.468 --> 17:02.802
in my work, all right?

17:02.803 --> 17:05.069
I want to kill him, not some
secondary infection.

17:25.821 --> 17:27.722
No.

17:28.491 --> 17:30.758
<i>Tell me what you know!</i>

17:51.308 --> 17:53.276
Move!

17:53.344 --> 17:54.947
Move, move, move!

17:54.948 --> 17:56.315
Everyone, move it! Move it!

17:56.316 --> 17:58.183
Oh, my God, Sarah!

17:58.184 --> 17:59.651
Sarah, I'm
freaking out right now!

17:59.652 --> 18:01.953
I've never been so happy
to see you in my life!

18:02.020 --> 18:03.053
Stop it!

18:03.054 --> 18:04.221
You're not you,
you're Rafe.

18:04.222 --> 18:06.022
You have to be him
in this situation.

18:06.023 --> 18:08.224
Think what he would do.
Live the lie.

18:34.679 --> 18:36.480
Come on, move!
We gotta split up!

18:36.481 --> 18:38.381
We'll contact you later
with your assignment!

18:38.383 --> 18:39.382
Rafe,
You're incredible!

18:39.383 --> 18:41.283
Yeah, whatever. It's my job.

18:51.659 --> 18:53.559
Good work, team.

18:55.496 --> 18:59.065
Wow, Bartowski really sold it.

18:59.133 --> 19:03.036
For a second, I hardly
even recognized him.

19:05.072 --> 19:07.273
Guys, I told you

19:07.341 --> 19:09.208
I needed a hard-out at 5:00!

19:09.209 --> 19:10.776
How am I gonna get
everything done?

19:10.777 --> 19:12.411
I gotta cook dinner,
my apartment's a pigsty,

19:12.412 --> 19:14.312
gotta pick up Hannah,
take a shower...

19:14.346 --> 19:15.479
Where is everybody?

19:15.480 --> 19:17.915
Walker and Shaw knew
you were in over your head.

19:17.983 --> 19:20.017
They went back to your place
to fix dinner

19:20.084 --> 19:21.586
for your date.
They did, huh?

19:21.587 --> 19:22.654
Weird, huh?

19:22.655 --> 19:24.622
Walker helping you get laid.

19:24.690 --> 19:29.960
Um, hey, Casey, I'm...
I'm sorry about your tooth.

19:30.028 --> 19:32.462
That's all right. At least
you got one with a cavity.

19:32.530 --> 19:34.430
Saved me a trip
to the dentist.

19:34.432 --> 19:35.866
You did good work, Chuck.

19:35.867 --> 19:37.834
Proud of you.

19:42.206 --> 19:44.107
You think you can be me?

19:44.175 --> 19:45.409
You shut your mouth.

19:45.410 --> 19:46.677
Where are you
taking Rafe?

19:46.678 --> 19:48.578
Interrogation.
Just wish

19:48.579 --> 19:49.879
I could do it
myself.

19:49.880 --> 19:52.547
You think you can be me?!

20:03.219 --> 20:04.386
Uh, Case,

20:04.387 --> 20:05.454
back there on
the mission,

20:05.455 --> 20:07.355
I flashed on

20:07.357 --> 20:09.554
the name "Alex Coburn."
Who is that?

20:09.621 --> 20:12.588
You mind your damn business.

20:24.666 --> 20:25.699
Oh, hey!

20:25.700 --> 20:27.234
Hi!

20:27.235 --> 20:29.602
Let's go eat.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.205
I'm not gonna lie
to you, boys,

20:33.206 --> 20:35.240
Bartowski is killing it
with the ladies.

20:35.307 --> 20:36.807
I know.

20:36.808 --> 20:39.143
First there was
that hot girl from Stanford.

20:39.210 --> 20:40.744
Jill.
Yeah.

20:40.745 --> 20:42.679
Then the brunette with
the overpriced deli.

20:42.746 --> 20:48.050
Lou. She was a fine, miniature
piece of woman.

20:48.118 --> 20:49.418
And now Hannah.

20:49.419 --> 20:51.552
I'd like to moisturize her feet
with my saliva.

20:51.620 --> 20:53.587
Don't you get it?
None of them matter.

20:53.655 --> 20:55.289
Chuck may try
to replace her,

20:55.290 --> 20:57.190
but when he's with
Sarah, the light

20:57.225 --> 20:58.726
in his eyes
shines brightly.

20:58.727 --> 21:01.762
Damn onions!

21:14.106 --> 21:16.006
Oh, knife.

21:16.006 --> 21:18.540
I want expectations
to be managed here.

21:18.608 --> 21:19.975
I'm not Chef Boyardee.

21:19.976 --> 21:21.609
Just looking forward
to hanging out with your sister.

21:21.610 --> 21:23.510
I like this one,
Chuck.

21:26.280 --> 21:28.180
Oh, my God, Chuck,

21:28.181 --> 21:29.815
this looks amazing.

21:29.816 --> 21:32.184
And smells amazing, too.

21:32.252 --> 21:34.052
Dude, I thought
you worked all day.

21:34.053 --> 21:35.553
How'd you find time
to do this?

21:35.554 --> 21:37.454
Um, you know,
it's a, it's a juggling act.

21:37.456 --> 21:39.490
No biggie.
I just threw it together.

21:39.558 --> 21:42.159
Uh, Devon, you want to help me
with the wine?

21:43.161 --> 21:44.694
Smells delish.

21:44.695 --> 21:46.763
My taste buds are fist bumping
each other, bro.

21:46.830 --> 21:48.730
Red okay?

21:49.333 --> 21:51.033
Listen, I didn't
do any of this, okay?

21:51.034 --> 21:52.367
I didn't buy the cheese.

21:52.368 --> 21:53.635
I didn't
make the dinner.

21:53.636 --> 21:54.870
Thank God,
I can tell you the truth.

21:54.871 --> 21:56.304
Stop. Stop.

21:56.305 --> 21:57.505
If you keep talking,

21:57.506 --> 21:58.640
I'm going to have
to lie to your sister,

21:58.641 --> 21:59.807
and I can't do that anymore.

21:59.808 --> 22:01.442
I'm not cut out
for this, Chuck.

22:01.443 --> 22:02.876
I'm not like you.

22:02.877 --> 22:04.278
I'm sorry. I get it.

22:04.279 --> 22:06.046
Look, from now on,
if Ellie asks you something,

22:06.047 --> 22:07.981
just say, "I don't know."
That's not a lie.

22:13.953 --> 22:16.188
I lied.

22:17.323 --> 22:18.823
I'm a liar.

22:18.824 --> 22:20.925
I've been telling you for
years that I love this dish.

22:20.992 --> 22:22.159
And it's been horrible.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.728
And now, I can tell you,
honestly, that this is

22:24.796 --> 22:26.696
fantastic.

22:28.399 --> 22:31.467
Well, yeah. I think you're just,
you're just being polite.

22:31.535 --> 22:32.701
It's not really my best.

22:32.702 --> 22:34.169
No, it is, actually.

22:34.170 --> 22:36.037
The others were
quite horrible.

22:36.038 --> 22:38.539
Devon, can you believe
that Chuck made this?

22:38.607 --> 22:40.074
I don't know.

22:40.075 --> 22:42.811
Isn't this
chicken moist?

22:42.878 --> 22:45.113
Chuck's chicken?

22:45.181 --> 22:47.081
This chicken?

22:47.082 --> 22:48.982
Chuck's chicken.

22:50.518 --> 22:52.152
Um...

22:52.153 --> 22:54.787
Hannah, don't you think
Chuck's chicken is moist?

22:54.854 --> 22:55.921
Actually, I, um...

22:55.922 --> 22:58.189
I'd like to make a toast.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.693
Um, you know how, in life,

23:04.761 --> 23:07.595
there's always something
that just doesn't line up?

23:07.663 --> 23:11.165
Like, um, either you're
working at the wrong job

23:11.233 --> 23:12.533
or dating the wrong guy,

23:12.534 --> 23:16.837
or you're eating
some really bad meal?

23:16.904 --> 23:18.004
Uh, but

23:18.005 --> 23:19.405
right at this second,

23:19.406 --> 23:21.773
I feel like I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

23:21.841 --> 23:24.041
And I want to
thank all of you

23:24.109 --> 23:26.009
for making me
feel that way.

23:29.613 --> 23:31.313
Hope dessert
doesn't suck.

23:31.314 --> 23:32.581
Um, cheers.

23:32.582 --> 23:34.482
Cheers.

23:48.292 --> 23:51.028
I managed to sneak
us out some chicken.

23:51.095 --> 23:53.663
I don't want to brag,
but it turned out pretty good.

23:53.731 --> 23:56.968
Oh, uh, no, thanks.
I'm not hungry.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.706
I'm clocking out. Have
you got this covered?

23:58.707 --> 24:01.609
Uh, yeah.

24:29.619 --> 24:31.053
This is cool.

24:31.054 --> 24:32.087
Is this new?

24:32.088 --> 24:34.222
Uh, yeah.

24:34.290 --> 24:35.490
Yeah.
Little perk of the job.

24:35.491 --> 24:37.191
You know, just testing it out.
Work thing.

24:37.192 --> 24:41.595
Listen, I, um, I
know this is fast,

24:41.662 --> 24:43.830
but my parents
are coming in

24:43.898 --> 24:45.632
from Santa Barbara
tonight for dinner.

24:45.633 --> 24:48.301
Oh. Yeah, and I wasn't
going to ask you to come,

24:48.368 --> 24:50.836
but since I got to hang
out with your family,

24:50.904 --> 24:52.604
I'd love it if
you met mine.

24:52.605 --> 24:55.540
Yeah, yeah.
I would love to meet them.

24:55.608 --> 24:57.609
Bartowski, I need your
professional opinion.

25:00.578 --> 25:02.479
Your latest
little lady said

25:02.547 --> 25:04.715
that you're some kind
of cooking expert.

25:04.782 --> 25:07.384
I need your
palette's advice.

25:07.452 --> 25:09.085
Uh, actually, you know,
my recipe last night

25:09.086 --> 25:10.220
didn't really
come together.

25:10.221 --> 25:11.321
That's not what she said.

25:11.322 --> 25:12.489
She said she
couldn't wait

25:12.490 --> 25:15.225
<i>to gobble up every bite.</i>

25:15.293 --> 25:16.626
Mouth as pretty
as Hannah's,

25:16.627 --> 25:18.228
she can taste
the difference.

25:18.229 --> 25:19.229
That's the mouth

25:19.230 --> 25:21.130
of a professional.

25:29.671 --> 25:31.571
Hello?
Burbank Buy More.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.574
The-the flavor profile's
not quite right.

25:35.642 --> 25:37.776
I think it could use a little
Worcestershire sauce, maybe.

25:37.844 --> 25:40.011
And, oh, oh, wait.
Is that frozen okra?

25:40.079 --> 25:43.514
Good taste in women,
bad taste in food.

25:48.652 --> 25:50.686
Jeffrey, if you double-dip,
we all may die.

25:50.754 --> 25:52.287
Who was that?
What did they want?

25:52.288 --> 25:53.889
Um, it was a wrong number.

25:53.890 --> 25:55.924
They were asking
for some guy named Rafe.

25:55.992 --> 25:59.693
That's odd.
What did you tell him?

25:59.761 --> 26:04.131
Um, I told them that this
was a Buy More phone.

26:04.198 --> 26:06.232
Uh, but the guy? Just,
he wouldn't listen,

26:06.300 --> 26:08.567
and he kept saying that he would
be here, in like, two minutes.

26:08.635 --> 26:10.535
Oh, here.

26:40.330 --> 26:42.197
What do you think you're
doing with that watch?

26:42.198 --> 26:44.265
I can explain.

26:44.333 --> 26:45.833
There is no
explanation.

26:45.834 --> 26:47.734
Give me this watch.

26:53.174 --> 26:55.075
For a bad ass killer to own
such a piece of crap watch?

26:55.143 --> 26:56.476
Crazy!

26:56.477 --> 26:58.411
So, we bought you
a little present,

26:58.479 --> 27:00.980
though "bought"
is a very loose term.

27:02.149 --> 27:04.450
Look at that.

27:04.517 --> 27:07.585
Gold. Wow.
It's very understated.

27:07.653 --> 27:09.353
What are you doing here
at Buy More, anyway?

27:09.354 --> 27:11.122
What, are you getting some
speaker wire to, uh...

27:11.123 --> 27:12.122
What do I look like,
a workaholic?

27:12.123 --> 27:13.389
A man's got to have

27:13.390 --> 27:14.490
hobbies other than murder.

27:14.491 --> 27:16.025
I was here browsing music.

27:16.026 --> 27:18.093
Hey, you saved us

27:18.161 --> 27:19.461
from getting pinched
yesterday, huh?

27:19.462 --> 27:21.062
What a guy.
Ooh, I could hit you.

27:21.063 --> 27:23.431
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

27:23.499 --> 27:24.799
Never seen
anything close

27:24.800 --> 27:26.234
to what you
pulled off, Rafe.

27:26.235 --> 27:28.135
The trick is
making it look easy.

27:28.203 --> 27:31.671
You did us a favor, and in
turn, we did you a favor.

27:31.738 --> 27:33.172
We tracked down
the location

27:33.173 --> 27:34.639
of the guy you're
supposed to kill.

27:34.640 --> 27:36.340
Good news, huh?

27:36.341 --> 27:38.241
Good news?

27:39.543 --> 27:41.978
That is very good news.

27:46.215 --> 27:48.516
Yeah. Enough of that.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.492
Oh, I'm sorry if
this is a bad time.

27:57.559 --> 27:59.627
No. Hey, Walker.
Come on in.

28:03.834 --> 28:06.802
Listen, Shaw, I just
wanted to say, um...

28:06.870 --> 28:08.871
What?

28:09.939 --> 28:12.874
Well, I-I came by to, um...

28:14.242 --> 28:16.544
I'm sorry. Can you please
put some clothes on?

28:16.612 --> 28:18.612
Oh. Yeah.

28:24.817 --> 28:28.152
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior last night.

28:28.220 --> 28:30.120
No apology necessary.

28:30.922 --> 28:32.089
Okay.

28:32.090 --> 28:34.424
Um...

28:34.491 --> 28:36.259
Well...

28:36.260 --> 28:38.995
You still, um...

28:39.062 --> 28:41.730
You okay with
this whole Chuck/Hannah thing?

28:41.798 --> 28:44.732
Thank you for asking.

28:46.701 --> 28:50.237
But that's not really the change

28:50.304 --> 28:52.472
that I'm having trouble with.

28:58.144 --> 29:00.411
So, who's the mark?

29:00.479 --> 29:02.379
Who am I taking out?

29:02.447 --> 29:03.613
He's in the hotel room
right over there.

29:03.614 --> 29:05.414
Got a girl with him.

29:05.415 --> 29:07.315
A real hot piece of tail.

29:07.351 --> 29:08.684
I think they're going to plow.

29:08.685 --> 29:10.119
Perfect distraction.

29:10.120 --> 29:11.319
How am I supposed
to see him?

29:11.320 --> 29:14.288
With this.

29:14.355 --> 29:15.956
Naturally.

29:15.957 --> 29:17.890
We hear you're one of five guys
that can make this shot.

29:17.958 --> 29:19.859
It's over
half a mile away.

29:19.927 --> 29:21.763
Well, apparently, my
reputation precedes me.

29:21.764 --> 29:23.764
Again.

29:41.345 --> 29:43.179
Oh, my God.

29:43.180 --> 29:45.080
What?

29:47.050 --> 29:48.350
SARAH
It's just really difficult

29:48.351 --> 29:50.885
to see Chuck
become a different person.

29:50.953 --> 29:52.453
That's the
mission, Walker.

29:52.454 --> 29:54.388
No, it's not the
mission. It's...

29:54.456 --> 29:55.789
Everything.

29:55.790 --> 29:57.024
Take the shot.

29:57.025 --> 29:58.792
It's how he pulled out
Casey's tooth,

29:58.793 --> 30:00.560
and how he burnt that asset
a couple of weeks ago,

30:00.561 --> 30:01.862
and the way he
lies to Hannah.

30:01.863 --> 30:04.898
I mean,
it's so easy for him.

30:04.966 --> 30:07.134
Chuck's changing.

30:11.372 --> 30:12.705
He's becoming a spy.

30:12.706 --> 30:14.939
I know. I know.

30:15.006 --> 30:18.470
But lives are being
affected here.

30:18.538 --> 30:20.972
Sounds like he's not
the only one who's changing.

30:23.208 --> 30:25.742
It's like I'm watching
Chuck disappear,

30:25.810 --> 30:27.576
and the further
he gets from who he is,

30:27.577 --> 30:30.611
the...
Cap him.

30:30.679 --> 30:32.612
It's okay. Talk to me, Sarah.

30:32.680 --> 30:34.147
Come on.

30:34.148 --> 30:37.217
Well, the more I want
to remember who I am-

30:37.285 --> 30:39.854
who I was before
all of this-

30:39.922 --> 30:43.891
Well, if this is
you, I like you.

30:43.958 --> 30:45.358
I want more.

30:45.359 --> 30:49.495
I've been on this assignment
for almost three years,

30:49.563 --> 30:52.097
and I've never told
anybody my real name.

30:52.165 --> 30:53.665
Not even Chuck?

30:53.666 --> 30:55.199
No.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.100
Not even Chuck.

30:58.670 --> 31:01.037
So, what is it?

31:03.607 --> 31:05.541
What's happening?

31:05.609 --> 31:06.876
What's going on?
Shut up! Shut up!

31:06.877 --> 31:08.844
Feels so weird
to say it out loud.

31:08.912 --> 31:10.779
Yeah, it's just, you
never seemed like a Sarah.

31:10.780 --> 31:12.680
It's 'cause I'm not.

31:13.082 --> 31:14.616
What is it, Rafe?

31:14.617 --> 31:16.985
I'm Sam.

31:17.053 --> 31:18.219
Hmm.

31:18.220 --> 31:21.189
My real name is Sam.

31:21.256 --> 31:24.625
Sam?

31:24.692 --> 31:26.994
Well...

31:27.061 --> 31:29.396
I'm going to kiss
you now, Sam.

31:49.439 --> 31:51.005
Sam?!

31:51.006 --> 31:52.106
Sam?

31:52.107 --> 31:53.607
Who's Sam?

31:53.608 --> 31:55.508
The guy you're supposed
to whack is Daniel Shaw.

31:55.510 --> 31:57.410
The organization that
had us contract you

31:57.411 --> 31:58.679
thought this
Shaw guy was dead.

31:58.680 --> 32:01.249
Turns out,
he's just not dead yet.

32:01.317 --> 32:03.552
This is the right guy
all right.

32:03.620 --> 32:06.221
So, who the hell is Sam?

32:06.288 --> 32:08.723
Sam...

32:08.791 --> 32:10.691
Sam's the girl.

32:11.460 --> 32:13.494
My girl.

32:13.562 --> 32:14.762
Sort of.

32:14.763 --> 32:18.067
Me and Sam are on
again, off again.

32:18.135 --> 32:21.440
Driving everyone in my
life a little crazy.

32:21.508 --> 32:24.143
I hate those "Will they
or won't they?" things.

32:24.211 --> 32:25.711
Just do it already!

32:25.712 --> 32:27.846
If you and this girl
love each other so much,

32:27.914 --> 32:28.981
what's keeping you apart?

32:28.982 --> 32:30.882
It's complicated.

32:31.918 --> 32:33.818
Sort of came down to a question
of work.

32:33.853 --> 32:35.220
What are you gonna do?

32:35.221 --> 32:36.521
You got your priorities
straight.

32:36.522 --> 32:38.122
Right?

32:38.123 --> 32:40.091
And plus, she's the one who's
always pushing me to be better

32:40.159 --> 32:41.326
at my job in the first place.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.227
Women- screwed
if you do,

32:43.295 --> 32:44.862
not screwed
if you don't.

32:44.863 --> 32:46.596
Wait a second.

32:46.597 --> 32:50.400
The guy you're supposed to whack
is banging your girl?

32:53.170 --> 32:55.737
It sure seems that
way, doesn't it? Huh.

32:55.805 --> 32:59.776
Jeez, this unlucky guy is
about to get double dead.

33:01.178 --> 33:03.479
SHAW
Do we have a situation?

33:03.547 --> 33:05.647
I tried contacting the agents
transporting Gruber,

33:05.715 --> 33:07.048
but they're not responding.

33:07.049 --> 33:08.115
They checked in yet?

33:08.116 --> 33:10.651
No.
Damn it!

33:12.020 --> 33:13.920
Get me Bartowski's last-known
location.

33:13.988 --> 33:15.888
What are you waiting on, Rafe?

33:22.394 --> 33:23.928
There.

33:23.929 --> 33:25.829
That's better.

33:34.638 --> 33:36.538
What's your problem, man?

33:36.540 --> 33:38.440
Ice him!
I can't do it.

33:39.676 --> 33:42.310
A bullet's too good
for this guy.

33:42.377 --> 33:45.645
Yeah, you gotta look
this jerk in the eye

33:45.713 --> 33:46.846
before you cap him.

33:46.847 --> 33:48.881
Yeah, yeah, my thoughts exactly.

33:48.949 --> 33:51.417
I'm going over there.

33:51.485 --> 33:52.751
You two stay put.

33:52.752 --> 33:54.419
Don't worry, Rafe.
We got your back.

33:54.420 --> 33:56.687
Anything weird goes down,
I'll take out the whole room.

33:56.755 --> 33:58.389
I ain't a marksman
like you are,

33:58.390 --> 34:00.023
but I make sure
they're all dead.

34:00.024 --> 34:02.926
Yeah, that's...
real good.

34:21.446 --> 34:23.346
Open the door!

34:23.380 --> 34:24.748
I know you're in there!

34:24.748 --> 34:27.183
I will kick this door down!

34:27.251 --> 34:29.150
What's going on?

34:29.186 --> 34:30.918
Shut your mouth!
I'll deal with you later.

34:30.920 --> 34:33.286
What's your problem?
My problem is that

34:33.355 --> 34:36.857
nobody messes with Rafe Gruber.

34:36.924 --> 34:39.292
They're watching us.

34:42.529 --> 34:44.630
I'd like you to remove those.

34:44.697 --> 34:46.598
No, no, no. These are the hands

34:46.599 --> 34:48.199
that are gonna
kill you, Shaw.

34:48.199 --> 34:50.100
What are you doing?!

34:51.870 --> 34:53.369
You stole my girl.

34:53.370 --> 34:56.371
I'm going to end you
for taking Sam!

35:00.042 --> 35:03.078
You had your chance
and you blew it.

35:12.620 --> 35:14.520
Who the hell are you?

35:27.932 --> 35:29.065
Ah, Shaw, wait!

35:29.066 --> 35:31.134
Shaw, enough!

35:36.473 --> 35:38.207
Would you stop already?

35:38.208 --> 35:40.375
I'm trying to sell myself
as Rafe!

35:42.011 --> 35:43.911
They're across the street
with a sniper rifle.

35:43.913 --> 35:45.613
They're gonna kill all of us!

35:45.614 --> 35:48.716
<i>No, I'm gonna kill all of you.</i>

36:01.828 --> 36:03.728
Come on. Flash.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.367
Flash!

36:10.368 --> 36:12.836
Come on! Flash!

36:26.916 --> 36:28.650
Wake up, pretty.

36:28.651 --> 36:29.718
Come on.
That's it.

36:29.719 --> 36:30.886
That's it.

36:30.887 --> 36:31.987
Come here, yeah.

36:31.988 --> 36:33.888
No, don't shoot!
Please don't!

36:35.091 --> 36:36.991
You two got it bad
for this blond.

36:36.992 --> 36:38.993
Can't say
I blame you.

36:39.060 --> 36:40.960
I'm gonna make it easy
on both of you.

36:40.995 --> 36:43.096
Take her out
of the equation.

36:46.300 --> 36:48.200
No!

37:21.061 --> 37:24.296
Five people in the world
can make this shot, huh?

37:24.364 --> 37:26.364
Guess I'm one of them.

37:32.641 --> 37:35.810
Hi.

37:35.878 --> 37:38.046
Um...

37:38.114 --> 37:41.282
you said that I could come to
you if I ever needed to talk.

37:41.350 --> 37:43.617
Yeah. I'm so glad.

37:43.685 --> 37:45.852
Please, start at the beginning.

37:47.755 --> 37:49.722
I feel like I'm living
a lie, Ellie.

37:49.790 --> 37:52.358
I used to be able
to compartmentalize

37:52.426 --> 37:55.327
these things, but it's, like,
it's all the time now.

37:55.395 --> 37:57.295
It never stops.

37:58.931 --> 38:03.767
I feel like I'm not me anymore.

38:05.002 --> 38:07.137
I think I know what
this is about.

38:07.204 --> 38:09.572
You do?

38:09.640 --> 38:12.074
Maybe things are moving too fast
with Hannah,

38:12.142 --> 38:15.645
and even though you
really like her,

38:15.712 --> 38:17.612
it feels dishonest because
the truth is

38:17.647 --> 38:20.015
that you still have feelings
for Sarah.

38:20.083 --> 38:23.384
Does that sound
about right?

38:23.452 --> 38:28.088
See, this is... this is why
I don't come talk to you, Ellie,

38:28.156 --> 38:29.656
'cause you're half a spy.

38:29.657 --> 38:31.324
I'm sorry, Chuck,
maybe that's not it.

38:31.325 --> 38:32.591
No. No, no, no.

38:32.592 --> 38:34.859
What I mean by that is
that you're an excellent

38:34.927 --> 38:36.827
half a spy.

38:39.363 --> 38:40.629
Thanks.

38:40.630 --> 38:42.530
Any time.

39:10.423 --> 39:12.824
Hi!

39:12.892 --> 39:14.892
Hi. I'm, uh,
I'm Chuck.

39:14.960 --> 39:17.128
Can we talk
for a second?

39:18.997 --> 39:20.430
Oh, yeah.

39:20.431 --> 39:22.331
Sorry.

39:37.779 --> 39:39.313
Are you okay, Chuck?

39:39.314 --> 39:41.715
What's the matter?

39:41.783 --> 39:45.019
You know how much
I like you, right?

39:48.423 --> 39:49.989
What's wrong?

39:49.990 --> 39:52.958
Hannah, there are things
in my life

39:53.026 --> 39:58.930
that you can't understand,
and I can't explain them to you.

39:58.998 --> 40:04.234
I've been dishonest,
and it's not fair to you.

40:04.301 --> 40:07.603
So I have to end this...

40:11.309 --> 40:12.710
...because you deserve to be
with someone

40:12.711 --> 40:13.711
who you can know

40:13.712 --> 40:15.847
completely and...

40:19.285 --> 40:24.121
I, um, I thought
you were a nice guy.

40:24.188 --> 40:25.422
No, I am a nice guy.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.757
No, you're not a nice guy.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.692
We had sex this morning,

40:28.760 --> 40:30.194
and now you are dumping me.

40:30.195 --> 40:31.228
No, it's not like that.

40:31.229 --> 40:33.130
Then how is it?
Explain it to me!

40:37.866 --> 40:41.966
Look, I have dated a lot
of liars before,

40:42.034 --> 40:44.534
so I usually know how
to spot them,

40:44.602 --> 40:49.234
but you- you're, like,
the best I've ever seen.

40:52.071 --> 40:56.173
I hope that your lies
keep you warm at night.

41:21.160 --> 41:24.462
So, now that the Ring
knows you're alive,

41:24.530 --> 41:27.097
looks like you're gonna
be down here for a while,

41:27.165 --> 41:28.799
so I bought you that.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.100
It's a Crock-Pot.
They're practically

41:30.101 --> 41:31.534
giving them away
at Buy More.

41:31.535 --> 41:34.670
And just so you know,

41:34.738 --> 41:39.474
the Castle is outside of Bamboo
Dragon's delivery radius.

41:39.542 --> 41:42.743
Thank you... Sam.
