<i>Someone once said if
it was raining brains...</i>

00:41.820 --> 00:43.776
<i>Roxy Robinson
wouldn't even get wet.</i>

00:54.780 --> 00:57.852
<i>Roxy spent his life making
two and two into five.</i>

00:58.500 --> 01:01.094
<i>He could smell trouble
like others smelled gas.</i>

01:01.780 --> 01:02.769
<i>But believe you me...</i>

01:02.980 --> 01:06.177
<i>he shouldn't have taken that
alley by Parito's bakery.</i>

01:29.580 --> 01:30.979
Your name Robinson?

01:31.940 --> 01:33.498
Roxy Robinson?

01:33.660 --> 01:35.412
You work for Fat Sam?

01:38.980 --> 01:41.653
<i>Whatever game it was,
sure as eggs...</i>

01:41.820 --> 01:44.618
<i>is eggs, Roxy the Weasel
had been scrambled.</i>

03:15.820 --> 03:18.380
<i>I should be filling you in.</i>

03:18.860 --> 03:21.420
<i>This guy's the hero of our story.</i>

03:21.580 --> 03:23.377
<i>Name of Bugsy Malone.</i>

03:23.540 --> 03:28.375
<i>A nice guy, a little too
popular with the broads.</i>

03:28.980 --> 03:32.575
<i>Italian mother, Irish
father. Grown up confused.</i>

03:33.180 --> 03:37.492
<i>Kinda mixed up. By the
way, my name's Sam.</i>

03:37.940 --> 03:39.612
<i>Fat Sam, because of my physique.</i>

03:39.980 --> 03:41.129
<i>I ain't no dumb-bell.</i>

03:41.300 --> 03:44.576
<i>And this ain't no bookshop.
This is my place.</i>

03:45.020 --> 03:47.534
<i>Fat Sam's Grand Slam.
Best joint in town.</i>

03:48.140 --> 03:49.368
- Hi, Jelly.
- Hi, Bugsy.

04:17.860 --> 04:20.168
<i>We interrupt this program
to bring you a news flash.</i>

04:20.579 --> 04:23.617
<i>We have reports of an incident
on the Lower East side...</i>

04:23.780 --> 04:27.853
<i>involving the man known
as Roxy the Weasel.</i>

04:28.100 --> 04:31.137
<i>Believed to be a member
of the gang of mobster king...</i>

04:31.300 --> 04:33.768
<i>Fat Sam Stacette.
Robinson was the victim of a...</i>

04:33.940 --> 04:35.658
<i>sensational event.</i>

04:35.820 --> 04:38.175
<i>We go over to our
reporter on the spot...</i>

04:38.780 --> 04:39.496
So tell me.

04:40.420 --> 04:42.411
How'd you allow this to happen?

04:43.100 --> 04:46.615
Roxy was one of my best!
What have you got to say...

04:46.780 --> 04:48.213
you bunch of dummies?

04:48.780 --> 04:49.929
Call yourselves hoodlums?

04:50.380 --> 04:53.019
You're a disgrace to the
profession. You hear me?

04:54.380 --> 04:57.258
And most of all, a
disgrace to me. Fat Sam.

04:58.380 --> 05:01.099
And we all know
who's behind this.

05:01.380 --> 05:02.495
Sure do, boss.

05:02.660 --> 05:04.332
Don't need a hatful of brains...

05:04.860 --> 05:06.532
- do you?
- Certainly not, boss.

05:06.700 --> 05:09.373
So who is it, dummies?
Tell me! Who?

05:09.540 --> 05:10.893
- Dandy...
- Dan.

05:11.260 --> 05:12.898
Don't mention that
name in this office!

05:13.060 --> 05:14.778
Take it easy, boss, sit down.

05:16.620 --> 05:17.211
Come in.

05:18.260 --> 05:22.094
I'm Blousey Brown. I'm a
singer, for the audition.

05:22.420 --> 05:23.899
A singer. A singer!

05:24.180 --> 05:26.489
I don't need a singer.
Come back tomorrow.

05:28.380 --> 05:31.053
How about my audition?
You said okay last week.

05:31.300 --> 05:34.258
Am I going mad? Are my
ears playing tricks on me?

05:34.820 --> 05:36.378
Will you get out of here!

05:37.100 --> 05:40.297
Dancers, dancers, surrounded
by namby-pamby dancers...

05:40.460 --> 05:43.020
singers, piano players
and banjo players...

05:43.420 --> 05:46.378
when I need brains.
Brains and muscles.

05:46.660 --> 05:47.775
You've got us, boss.

05:49.860 --> 05:51.134
You? You hunk of lard!

05:51.460 --> 05:53.178
You got muscles where
you should have brains.

05:53.340 --> 05:56.173
My canary's got more
brains than you! Dumb salami.

06:03.260 --> 06:04.295
What's funny?

06:10.180 --> 06:13.934
Don't worry, I've been trying
to see him for months.

06:14.220 --> 06:15.733
- You have?
- Of course.

06:15.900 --> 06:18.539
- What do you do?
- I'm the greatest tap dancer.

06:18.740 --> 06:21.538
- You are?
- Of course I are. Cross my heart.

06:21.700 --> 06:24.089
But all he says is
come back tomorrow.

06:24.500 --> 06:27.219
How many times can
I come back tomorrow?

06:36.740 --> 06:38.856
<i>Anybody who is anybody...</i>

06:39.020 --> 06:41.739
<i>will soon walk through that door.</i>

<i>Always able to find you a table...</i>

07:00.900 --> 07:02.970
<i>but it's your home sweet home.</i>

07:04.660 --> 07:05.615
<i>games are played here...</i>

07:05.780 --> 07:07.532

sitting by the kitchen...</i>

07:39.180 --> 07:41.330
<i>said he caught his fingers

08:55.980 --> 08:56.776
You know something?

08:57.140 --> 08:59.700
You look like you put your
face on backwards this morning.

08:59.860 --> 09:02.169
- You got too much mouth.
- I'll tell my dentist.

09:04.820 --> 09:07.971
- Watch where you're going.
- Sorry. It's your fault.

09:08.140 --> 09:09.937
What's that, a
hockey stick?

09:10.100 --> 09:11.533
No, a baseball bat.

09:13.740 --> 09:15.093
You're a baseball player?

09:15.380 --> 09:17.575
No, a dancer. My mother
made me pack it.

09:17.740 --> 09:20.652
- You a sports nut?
- It's for protection.

09:21.300 --> 09:24.212
- You take it everywhere?
- No, I came about a job.

09:24.460 --> 09:26.769
- You get it?
- They said come back tomorrow.

09:27.740 --> 09:29.412
- What's your name?
- Brown.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.936
Sounds like a loaf of bread.

09:32.580 --> 09:33.535
Blousey Brown.

09:33.700 --> 09:34.689
Blousey Brown?

09:34.900 --> 09:36.458
A stale loaf of bread.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.338
Very funny. Terrific.

09:39.220 --> 09:40.892
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Bugsy Malone.

09:41.340 --> 09:42.773
Don't call us.
We'll call you.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.858
It's okay, everybody.

10:11.740 --> 10:13.412
Just a little excitement.

10:13.980 --> 10:17.370
Razzmatazz, music. I wanna see
everyone enjoying themselves.

10:18.020 --> 10:20.739
Can't say Fat Sam's place ain't
the liveliest joint in town.

10:25.700 --> 10:29.090
Knuckles, this means trouble.

11:19.260 --> 11:21.251
- You know what to do?
- Sure, boss.

11:26.340 --> 11:27.216
Step on it, Jackson.

12:46.820 --> 12:47.570
What is this?

12:54.980 --> 12:55.617
Irving.

12:57.660 --> 12:58.775
Get me out of here.

13:06.020 --> 13:08.978
- Located the gun yet?
- I can't answer that.

13:09.140 --> 13:11.779
- Not at liberty to say?
- No. I don't know the answer.

13:11.940 --> 13:13.168
Where do the guns come from?

13:13.660 --> 13:15.616
I'm not at liberty to say.

13:15.780 --> 13:17.691
Ask Captain Smolsky.

13:23.380 --> 13:25.132
O'Dreary, break up the crowd.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.450
- Have you found the gun?
- No comment.

13:27.620 --> 13:29.372
- And the source of the guns?
- No comment.

13:29.540 --> 13:32.657
Is it true that only
one gang uses the gun?

13:32.940 --> 13:33.577
No comment.

13:40.780 --> 13:41.929
Can I give you a lift?

13:42.100 --> 13:43.772
- You got a car?
- No.

13:44.140 --> 13:46.938
How you gonna give me
a lift? Stand me on a box?

13:48.540 --> 13:51.498
- We could share a taxi.
- Forget it. I don't share fares.

13:51.940 --> 13:54.932
I'm a lady.
Furthermore, I'm broke.

13:55.380 --> 13:57.894
- Who said share fares?
- No?

13:58.260 --> 14:00.490
No. I wouldn't dream of it.

14:00.660 --> 14:02.378
- You wouldn't?
- I thought you'd pay.

14:02.980 --> 14:03.617
Swell.

14:05.300 --> 14:07.655
Let's walk.
It's a nice night.

14:08.020 --> 14:10.375
You shouldn't walk at
night. It's dangerous.

14:10.660 --> 14:13.128
We'll be okay. We
got your baseball bat.

14:13.580 --> 14:16.048
Quit the "we" bit.
You mean, I'll be okay.

14:19.420 --> 14:21.934
- Which way you going?
- Which way you going?

14:23.620 --> 14:25.815
- This way.
- Then I'm going this way.

14:30.780 --> 14:31.735
Let me take that.

14:31.940 --> 14:34.056
No, it's all right.
Look, beat it, will you?

14:35.540 --> 14:38.418
- What have you got in here?
- Just a few books.

14:38.780 --> 14:40.850
Few books? You
should start a library.

14:41.020 --> 14:42.419
You should shut your mouth.

14:43.020 --> 14:45.693
- Have you eaten?
- Ever since I was a kid.

14:45.860 --> 14:48.772
- How come you're so skinny?
- Because I watch my weight.

14:49.060 --> 14:52.018
I do that when I'm broke,
too. How about eating now?

14:52.300 --> 14:52.891
No.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.137
- Why not?
- I'm not hungry.

14:55.300 --> 14:56.892
- Not hungry?
- No.

14:58.420 --> 14:59.250
I'm starving.

14:59.900 --> 15:00.889
That's more like it.

15:09.180 --> 15:10.613
- Goodnight, Fizzy.
- Goodnight.

15:10.860 --> 15:12.088
- Goodnight, Fizzy.
- Goodnight.

15:12.460 --> 15:13.051
Goodnight.

15:13.780 --> 15:14.496
Goodnight.

15:17.100 --> 15:17.930
Take it easy.

15:23.180 --> 15:24.374
Don't do that, Knuckles.

15:24.540 --> 15:25.939
It's how I got my name.

15:26.460 --> 15:28.018
Knock it off or
change your name.

15:30.980 --> 15:32.936
Tallulah, how long
we got to wait?

15:33.180 --> 15:36.092
Coming. You don't want me
looking a mess, do you?

15:37.020 --> 15:37.930
Snap it up, will you?

15:38.180 --> 15:40.375
Put your flaps down,
or you'll take off.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.418
You spend more time
prettying yourself than anyone.

15:43.700 --> 15:46.658
If I didn't look this good,
you wouldn't look at me.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.651
I'll see you in the car.

15:49.700 --> 15:50.928
What about my audition?

15:51.220 --> 15:54.576
Tomorrow, Fizzy. I'm tired.
Lots of important business.

15:54.820 --> 15:57.937
I have to go home.
I promise you, tomorrow.

15:58.100 --> 15:58.976
Goodbye. Goodnight.

16:00.860 --> 16:03.010
- You coming, Velma?
- Sure.

16:04.260 --> 16:05.978
- Goodnight, Fizzy.
- Goodnight, Miss Tallulah.

16:06.220 --> 16:07.016
Oh, my purse.

16:24.180 --> 16:25.852
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

16:27.580 --> 16:30.014
<i>Tomorrow never comes.</i>

16:31.060 --> 16:36.612
<i>What kind of a fool
do they take me for?</i>

16:37.660 --> 16:39.571
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

16:41.140 --> 16:44.132
<i>A resting place for bums...</i>

16:44.580 --> 16:50.132

16:51.420 --> 16:54.571

17:14.900 --> 17:18.017

17:18.579 --> 17:20.536
<i>Tomorrow...</i>

17:22.060 --> 17:22.810
<i>an awful...</i>

17:22.980 --> 17:24.857
<i>place to be.</i>

17:25.380 --> 17:31.569
<i>I gave up yesterday,
but they still want more.</i>

17:32.340 --> 17:35.332
<i>They'll compare me...</i>

17:35.500 --> 17:36.728
<i>to Fred Astaire...</i>

17:36.900 --> 17:39.573
<i>when I'm done.</i>

17:39.740 --> 17:40.331
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:44.780 --> 17:47.852
<i>Anyone who feels the rhythm
moving through him...</i>

17:48.020 --> 17:54.698
<i>knows it's gonna do him good

<i>when you feel it, show it,
let the people know it...</i>

18:00.820 --> 18:06.929

<i>tomorrow's far away...</i>

18:30.300 --> 18:32.973
<i>tomorrow, as they say...</i>

18:33.420 --> 18:36.617
<i>is reserved for dreams.</i>

18:36.940 --> 18:38.817
<i>Tomorrow...</i>

18:40.180 --> 18:43.013
<i>tomorrow's looking grey...</i>

18:43.540 --> 18:49.649
<i>a playground always locked
trains no winning teams.</i>

18:50.220 --> 18:53.098
<i>Won't take no for an answer...</i>

18:53.420 --> 18:56.696
<i>I was born to be a dancer...</i>

18:56.860 --> 19:00.614
<i>now.</i>

19:03.500 --> 19:06.537
<i>Anyone who feels the rhythm
moving through him...</i>

19:06.700 --> 19:08.019
<i>knows it's gonna do him good...</i>

19:08.180 --> 19:09.499
<i>to let the music...</i>

19:09.660 --> 19:12.128
<i>burst out.</i>

19:16.020 --> 19:18.978
<i>When you feel it, show it,
let the people know it...</i>

19:19.140 --> 19:20.539
<i>let your laughter loose...</i>

19:20.700 --> 19:25.012
<i>till your scream becomes
a love shout.</i>

20:13.660 --> 20:15.059
Going to the speakeasy tomorrow?

20:15.500 --> 20:19.175
Depends. I'm trying my
luck at the Bijoux Theatre.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.535
Lena Marelli's show?

20:20.780 --> 20:22.736
She walked out. They're
changing everything.

20:23.980 --> 20:25.333
How long have you
wanted to be a singer?

20:26.140 --> 20:31.339
I don't want to be just a
singer, I wanna be a movie star...

20:31.620 --> 20:32.416
in Hollywood.

20:34.260 --> 20:35.090
What's so funny?

20:35.500 --> 20:36.216
I don't know.

20:36.860 --> 20:40.614
Time was when people were
happy being railway engineers...

20:40.820 --> 20:41.730
or nurses.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.015
Don't you want to be anybody?

20:43.220 --> 20:44.812
No. I'm happy being me.

20:45.380 --> 20:46.210
What do you do?

20:46.420 --> 20:47.569
Oh, this and that.

20:48.100 --> 20:50.534
- Crooked, huh?
- No, in-between.

20:50.980 --> 20:51.776
What do you do for money?

20:52.060 --> 20:54.369
- I find boxers.
- You do?

20:54.900 --> 20:56.174
I used to fight myself.

20:56.420 --> 20:57.648
You did? How good were you?

20:58.020 --> 21:00.739
- I could've been a contender.
- You could?

21:00.900 --> 21:03.255
Sure, but for a few things.

21:03.460 --> 21:07.009
- Like what?
- Like a glass jaw.

21:07.580 --> 21:09.377
Jelly legs, no stamina.

21:09.940 --> 21:11.532
- And most of all...
- What?

21:12.020 --> 21:12.896
I got scared.

21:14.460 --> 21:15.734
Some contender.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.775
- Want another drink?
- No, I had enough.

21:18.980 --> 21:19.651
Come on.

21:20.060 --> 21:22.210
- Thought you didn't have money?
- I haven't.

21:22.540 --> 21:24.098
- Then how you...?
- Relax.

21:24.620 --> 21:25.814
I'll think of something.

21:26.340 --> 21:27.329
Two more drinks.

21:27.700 --> 21:30.817
Look, pal, the food counter's
closed. the bar's closed.

21:31.100 --> 21:32.374
My eyes are closing.

21:32.540 --> 21:33.814
The whole joint’s closed.

21:34.380 --> 21:35.415
I didn't want one, anyway.

21:44.940 --> 21:45.531
Hello.

21:45.700 --> 21:50.251
Operator, could you test this
line? I believe we have a fault.

21:50.580 --> 21:54.698
- What number, please?
- Columbus 19785.

21:54.860 --> 21:56.737
- I'll call you right back.
- Thank you.

22:02.180 --> 22:02.817
How much I owe you?

22:03.820 --> 22:06.095
Eight banana boozle specials,
with double ice cream.

22:06.500 --> 22:07.649
Three beef spitfires...

22:08.060 --> 22:10.449
two cream donuts
and a salami special.

22:10.780 --> 22:11.735
Four dollars and 80 cents.

22:15.660 --> 22:16.251
Excuse me.

22:23.460 --> 22:24.051
Hello.

22:25.580 --> 22:26.410
Let me out!

22:26.580 --> 22:28.013
What are you doing? Let me out!

22:47.060 --> 22:49.620
<i>We interrupt commentary
of tonight's ball game...</i>

22:49.940 --> 22:54.218
<i>to bring you a bulletin
on gang warfare.</i>

22:54.700 --> 22:56.179
<i>Police now officially state...</i>

22:56.340 --> 22:59.013
<i>that the new weapon
of foreign manufacture...</i>

22:59.180 --> 23:01.489
<i>known as the splurge gun
is being widely used...</i>

23:01.660 --> 23:04.254
<i>by mobster gangs.
We now go back to...</i>

23:04.620 --> 23:07.009
<i>our reporter, Seymour Scoop.</i>

23:33.180 --> 23:35.171
What's more, it's just not cricket.

24:33.220 --> 24:35.336
There's a Mr. Bronx
Charlie to see you.

24:35.980 --> 24:39.097
I'll be right in. Show them
into the conservatory.

24:39.260 --> 24:39.851
Very good, sir.

24:40.500 --> 24:42.491
Aren't you gonna play no more?

24:42.780 --> 24:45.055
Later, my rose. Later.

24:47.700 --> 24:52.615
<i>Velia, oh Velia...</i>

24:52.860 --> 24:56.455
<i>the witch of the wood...</i>

24:58.980 --> 25:06.853
<i>would I not die for
you if I could.</i>

25:08.380 --> 25:12.692
<i>Velia, oh Velia...</i>

25:13.020 --> 25:14.738
- Next!
- Very nice.

25:14.900 --> 25:17.334
Lovely. Next.
Get off the stage!

25:17.860 --> 25:19.179
Don't give up your day job.

25:20.140 --> 25:22.335
I didn't figure
on this many people.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.536
They all look like
jugglers and magicians.

25:25.140 --> 25:27.779
Don't worry. You got no
competition. You'll walk it.

25:27.940 --> 25:28.850
Hurry up.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.333
Evening, ladies and gentlemen.

25:31.860 --> 25:35.136
I'm proud to be here.
In fact, I'm lucky to be here.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.131
Because as I was coming here...

25:37.740 --> 25:39.651
- How do I look?
- Fine.

25:40.060 --> 25:42.449
- I look terrible.
- Believe me, you look swell.

25:42.860 --> 25:44.054
- Honest?
- Honest.

25:44.220 --> 25:46.814
- Cross your heart?
- Cross my heart. Beautiful.

25:49.420 --> 25:50.216
Next.

25:51.980 --> 25:54.619
<i>Once I built a railroad...</i>

25:54.860 --> 25:57.090
Not that old chestnut.

25:57.420 --> 25:58.569
Get him off. Next.

25:58.980 --> 26:01.096
Good evening.

26:01.620 --> 26:04.737
Suppose you're
wondering why we're here.

26:04.900 --> 26:05.491
You bet.

26:05.980 --> 26:06.776
Next.

26:06.940 --> 26:07.850
Not one rabbit...

26:08.980 --> 26:10.049
not two rabbits...

26:10.860 --> 26:12.339
but three rabbits.

26:12.580 --> 26:14.172
Next, next.

26:16.220 --> 26:17.016
Next.

26:29.060 --> 26:30.015
Yeah, great. Okay.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.450
Next one there, please.

26:32.660 --> 26:33.456
Give me your things.

26:33.620 --> 26:35.451
Come on, come on.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.092
Blousey Brown, singer.

26:50.140 --> 26:51.050
Oh, nice face.

26:51.300 --> 26:54.019
Great face, could
do a lot with that.

26:56.580 --> 26:57.217
Oscar.

26:57.540 --> 26:58.177
Oscar.

26:58.620 --> 26:59.257
Oscar.

26:59.500 --> 27:02.810
I'm back. I'll give
you one more chance.

27:03.020 --> 27:05.170
Lena, you've come back to me.

27:05.380 --> 27:07.052
I'll give you one more chance.

27:07.420 --> 27:10.457
Otherwise, I'm out for
good. Out, out, out!

27:10.660 --> 27:12.616
I won't be humiliated.

27:12.780 --> 27:16.455
I'm the star and I
should be treated like one.

27:16.940 --> 27:18.419
Hit it, Joe.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.848
<i>Show business,
it's in my veins...</i>

27:26.140 --> 27:28.415
<i>gotta keep singing
that old refrain...</i>

27:28.580 --> 27:31.094
<i>I thrill to all those tunes
that make me wanna dance...</i>

27:31.260 --> 27:33.012
Cheer up. There's
a million other jobs.

27:33.180 --> 27:36.013
Sure, standing on the
corner asking for dimes.

27:36.180 --> 27:39.297
It's only a matter of time.

27:39.740 --> 27:43.494
I've walked the streets for
months, and the only fancy steps...

27:43.660 --> 27:45.696
I've been doing is avoiding
the rent collector.

27:46.140 --> 27:47.892
Takes time to be a movie star.

27:48.060 --> 27:49.288
We could come back tomorrow.

27:49.580 --> 27:53.016
Come back tomorrow? I spend
my whole life doing that.

27:53.180 --> 27:55.057
Knock it off. Cool down.

27:55.220 --> 27:56.414
I will not cool down.

27:56.580 --> 27:57.569
Don't be stupid.

27:58.060 --> 27:59.698
Will you be quiet up there?

27:59.900 --> 28:01.253
I'm rehearsing.

28:03.060 --> 28:04.891
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

28:06.220 --> 28:08.176
There's always Fat Sam's place.

28:08.340 --> 28:10.092
- He won't see me.
- I'll talk to him.

28:10.260 --> 28:12.535
- You know him?
- Know him? We're like that.

28:12.820 --> 28:13.650
You're good friends?

28:14.180 --> 28:17.252
No, but when I see him I cross my
fingers that he won't hit me.

28:17.540 --> 28:19.337
Come on, let's get out of here.

28:20.060 --> 28:21.732
You're too good for this show.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.414
- Why don't we try Fat Sam's?
- Yeah.

28:24.980 --> 28:25.935
<i>You gotta be kidding...</i>

28:26.420 --> 28:31.494
<i>that show business is my business...</i>

28:40.660 --> 28:42.412
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, boss.

28:42.900 --> 28:44.856
Relax, relax, will you?

28:48.660 --> 28:52.699
I'd like to take the opportunity
to thank you for your work.

28:53.300 --> 28:56.019
Everything's gone so well.

28:56.180 --> 28:57.090
Thanks, boss.

28:57.420 --> 28:58.330
Thanks, boss.

28:59.140 --> 29:01.290
Fat Sam must've had quite a shock.

29:01.460 --> 29:02.779
- Quite a shock.
- Thanks, boss.

29:03.900 --> 29:05.652
- Thanks, boss.
- Thanks.

29:06.380 --> 29:06.971
Thanks, boss.

29:07.660 --> 29:08.331
Laughing boy.

29:09.580 --> 29:13.937
Yonkers. Shoulders.
Bronx Charlie. Benny Lee.

29:14.820 --> 29:17.288
Any moment now Fat Sam will be...

29:17.460 --> 29:18.734
crawling on his knees to me.

29:18.900 --> 29:19.730
On his knees.

29:19.900 --> 29:22.619
- Where's my flower, boss?
- Yes...

29:22.780 --> 29:25.852
soon all Fat Sam will have
is the suit he stands up in...

29:26.020 --> 29:27.055
and a suitcase full of memories.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.249
I don't have a flower, boss.

29:47.940 --> 29:48.577
What did I do?

29:48.860 --> 29:50.896
You googed, Doodle.
You dropped the gun.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.258
And I don't allow mistakes.

29:53.420 --> 29:55.012
'Cause they put us in the caboose.

29:55.900 --> 29:58.255
- And Sing Sing ain't my style.
- No, boss.

29:58.420 --> 30:00.251
Not that. Anything but that.

30:00.740 --> 30:02.890
I didn't mean to drop it.
It slipped outta my hands.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.211
Button your lip.
You're all washed up.

30:05.540 --> 30:07.690
- Give a guy a break.
- Get him!

30:14.220 --> 30:17.417
Now listen to what I
say, and listen good.

30:18.260 --> 30:20.137
There's only room for one
Mr. Big in this town.

30:20.700 --> 30:22.338
And that's me, Dandy Dan.

30:23.020 --> 30:25.853
The time has come for
us to play our next card.

30:26.540 --> 30:29.054
Believe me, Fat Sam
and his dumb bums...

30:29.220 --> 30:30.892
ain't gonna stand in our way.

30:31.300 --> 30:32.733
<i>We could've been anything...</i>

30:32.900 --> 30:34.572
<i>that we wanted to be.</i>

30:35.660 --> 30:38.538
<i>But don't it make your heart glad...</i>

30:39.980 --> 30:43.529
<i>that we take pride in it...</i>

30:44.300 --> 30:47.133
<i>we became the best at being bad.</i>

30:48.540 --> 30:51.976
<i>We could've been
anything we wanted to be...</i>

30:52.980 --> 30:55.369
<i>with all the talent we had.</i>

30:57.140 --> 31:00.769
<i>No doubt about it,
we whine and we pout it...</i>

31:01.540 --> 31:02.893
<i>we're the very best at being...</i>

31:03.060 --> 31:05.051
<i>bad guys.</i>

31:05.460 --> 31:07.132
<i>We're rotten to the core...</i>

31:07.780 --> 31:11.693
<i>congratulations,
no one likes you anymore...</i>

31:12.220 --> 31:13.812
<i>bad guys...</i>

31:14.100 --> 31:15.613
<i>we're the very worst.</i>

31:16.540 --> 31:18.258
<i>Each of us contemptible...</i>

31:18.420 --> 31:20.297
<i>we're criticized and cursed...</i>

31:21.020 --> 31:22.135
<i>we've made the big-time...</i>

31:22.300 --> 31:24.450
<i>malicious and mad...</i>

31:25.300 --> 31:28.178
<i>we're the very best at being bad.</i>

31:28.780 --> 31:30.133
<i>Look at me, I'm dancin'.</i>

31:31.660 --> 31:34.936
<i>We could've been anything
we wanted to be...</i>

31:36.020 --> 31:38.454
<i>we took the easy way out...</i>

31:40.340 --> 31:43.855
<i>with a little training,
we've mastered complaining...</i>

31:44.340 --> 31:46.410
<i>made us seem unnecessary...</i>

31:46.580 --> 31:48.650
<i>we're so rude, it's scary...</i>

31:48.860 --> 31:52.057
<i>We could've been anything
we wanted to be...</i>

31:53.140 --> 31:55.290
<i>with all the talent we had...</i>

31:57.380 --> 31:58.733
<i>with a little practice</i>

31:58.980 --> 32:00.811
<i>we made every black list...</i>

32:01.700 --> 32:02.416
<i>we're the very best...</i>

32:02.580 --> 32:04.411
<i>at being bad...</i>

32:05.860 --> 32:06.690
<i>we're the very best...</i>

32:06.860 --> 32:08.498
<i>at being bad.</i>

32:08.660 --> 32:09.456
<i>Where you shovin' me?</i>

32:10.140 --> 32:12.973
<i>We're the very best at being bad.</i>

32:29.380 --> 32:31.940
What are you doing?

32:32.260 --> 32:34.057
Get in here, you bunch
of peanut brains.

32:34.540 --> 32:36.178
Get in here, you dummies.

32:36.340 --> 32:38.729
We got business
to do. Move it!

32:48.140 --> 32:49.539
Come on, get in here.

32:50.300 --> 32:51.494
We got business to do.

32:51.660 --> 32:53.173
We can't waste
all this time.

32:54.300 --> 32:54.891
Right.

32:55.260 --> 32:56.170
Let's get down to it.

32:57.140 --> 32:59.449
Don't do that, Snake Eyes.
It's thinking time.

33:00.580 --> 33:01.979
And don't do that, Knuckles.

33:02.460 --> 33:03.210
Sure thing, boss.

33:03.540 --> 33:04.893
Let's start at the beginning.

33:05.660 --> 33:08.220
We're being outsmarted
by that lounge lizard.

33:08.380 --> 33:10.450
And we're gonna get back on top.

33:10.620 --> 33:11.894
Back on top.

33:12.060 --> 33:14.255
We'll kick that drugstore cowboy...

33:14.420 --> 33:15.978
- into line.
- You bet, boss.

33:16.380 --> 33:19.895
We've been a little slow off
the mark, but dumb bums we ain't.

33:20.060 --> 33:22.369
No, dumb bums we ain't.

33:23.300 --> 33:24.619
Hand me a pie.

33:28.620 --> 33:31.180
- Louie, over there in the corner.
- Me, boss?

33:32.340 --> 33:33.090
Why me?

33:33.500 --> 33:34.489
Louie, into the corner.

33:35.020 --> 33:35.896
What did I do?

33:36.260 --> 33:37.010
Nothing, Louie.

33:38.340 --> 33:40.137
You see? Missed.

33:40.820 --> 33:42.458
Okay, Lou. You can sit down.

33:43.020 --> 33:45.659
Even a dumb bum like
Louie is too quick for us.

33:46.460 --> 33:49.418
That's our trouble.
We're behind the times.

33:49.700 --> 33:51.019
I don't get it.

33:51.180 --> 33:54.252
We'll never get back on top
with this kind of hardware.

33:54.420 --> 33:55.648
It's old-fashioned.

33:56.100 --> 33:59.490
In short, we gotta
get that gun.

34:03.740 --> 34:05.458
<i>- Hello.
- Want some information?</i>

34:05.620 --> 34:06.939
<i>- Start gabbin'...
- It's about the splurge gun.</i>

34:07.100 --> 34:09.091
<i>It's at the Hung Fu
Shin laundry company.</i>

34:09.260 --> 34:10.898
Yeah. Okay. Thanks.

34:14.219 --> 34:17.018
We've had a little break.

34:18.100 --> 34:19.976
Who knows the Hung Fu
Shin laundry company?

34:21.300 --> 34:25.771
My friend tells me that's
where they stash the guns.

34:26.780 --> 34:27.576
Get moving!

34:28.820 --> 34:30.856
Not you, Knuckles.
Stay here with me.

34:31.020 --> 34:31.735
Sure, boss.

35:43.380 --> 35:44.972
Hello. What?

35:47.020 --> 35:49.739
I don't believe it.
The whole gang?

35:50.860 --> 35:51.531
Everybody?

35:57.740 --> 36:00.698
That leaves you and
me. We're on our own.

36:01.140 --> 36:02.368
What we gonna do?

36:03.100 --> 36:05.295
Don't do that! How many
times I got to tell you?

36:06.500 --> 36:09.139
Do nothing. Act like
everything was normal.

36:11.620 --> 36:14.498
- What does that mean?
- You can't speak Italian?

36:15.020 --> 36:16.135
No, boss, I'm Jewish.

36:16.500 --> 36:17.933
Then read the translation!

36:42.660 --> 36:44.139
- Hey, Fizzy.
- Hey, Bugsy.

36:44.660 --> 36:46.855
- Still practicing?
- Still practicing.

36:49.420 --> 36:51.456
Suddenly everybody wants
to be in show business.

36:52.580 --> 36:55.538
Hi. Tallulah. I've
come to see Fat Sam.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.857
- Is he in?
- No, he's busy.

36:58.700 --> 37:00.258
- Hi, Bugsy.
- Hi.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.058
Have a drink while you wait.

37:05.980 --> 37:07.095
Yeah, why not?

37:09.580 --> 37:11.332
Go feed the ducks, will you?

37:11.500 --> 37:12.933
Oh, Tallulah.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.294
I said, beat it.

37:22.620 --> 37:24.212
Long time no see.

37:24.780 --> 37:27.533
- You know how it is.
- Yeah.

37:29.820 --> 37:31.811
You used to come see me every night.

37:31.980 --> 37:34.494
- I've been busy.
- Busy doing what?

37:35.180 --> 37:36.249
This and that.

37:40.340 --> 37:42.615
Fizzy, cut the ivory
and hit the shoe leather.

37:44.660 --> 37:45.376
Yes, ma'am.

37:52.220 --> 37:53.369
You're aces, Bugsy.

37:55.340 --> 37:56.819
I always found you special.

37:57.260 --> 37:59.410
Careful, you're racing my mother.

37:59.580 --> 38:02.219
Come on, give a girl a break.

38:02.380 --> 38:04.018
Sure you've got the right fella?

38:04.180 --> 38:06.694
- You're not like those other saps.
- No?

38:07.220 --> 38:07.811
No.

38:09.260 --> 38:11.216
You've got lovely brown eyes.

38:11.580 --> 38:13.889
They'll be black eyes
if Fat Sam catches us.

38:15.540 --> 38:18.134
- How about smearing my lipstick?
- Careful.

38:18.380 --> 38:21.452
If you come any closer,
I'll have to call my lawyer.

38:23.060 --> 38:23.651
So call him.

38:33.020 --> 38:33.816
Blousey.

38:35.580 --> 38:36.217
Blousey.

38:37.620 --> 38:38.609
Blousey.

38:44.860 --> 38:46.896
It's the broad about the audition.

38:47.380 --> 38:49.018
He's busy. Come back tomorrow.

38:49.740 --> 38:50.536
No, no, no.

38:51.340 --> 38:54.059
Hey, honey. I'm all ears.
Be with you in a minute.

38:55.940 --> 38:58.659
Carry on as normal.
Don't let 'em know we're beat.

38:58.820 --> 39:00.538
- Business as usual.
- Right.

39:00.700 --> 39:02.292
- Calm and collected.
- Right.

39:02.460 --> 39:04.690
So they don't know we're
scared. I mean, concerned.

39:05.260 --> 39:05.851
Sure, boss.

39:19.500 --> 39:22.173
<i>I'm feeling fine...</i>

39:22.900 --> 39:25.494
<i>filled with emotions...</i>

39:26.180 --> 39:28.853
<i>stronger than wine...</i>

39:29.180 --> 39:31.535
<i>they give me the notion...</i>

39:31.780 --> 39:34.658
<i>that this strange new feeling...</i>

39:34.940 --> 39:39.536
<i>is something that
you're feeling too.</i>

39:45.100 --> 39:46.818
<i>Matter of fact...</i>

39:48.140 --> 39:50.893
<i>I'm forced to admit it...</i>

39:51.380 --> 39:53.371
<i>caught in the act...</i>

39:54.580 --> 39:56.457
<i>and maybe we've hit it...</i>

39:57.020 --> 40:00.057
<i>this strange new feeling...</i>

40:00.340 --> 40:03.332
<i>is something you're feeling...</i>

40:03.500 --> 40:05.570
Okay, honey. That's enough.

40:06.700 --> 40:10.215
A little contemporary for
me, but very nice. You're hired.

40:21.380 --> 40:24.053
That was great. That
really was. Terrific.

40:27.540 --> 40:28.336
Blousey.

40:29.100 --> 40:30.499
Come back, will you?

40:31.500 --> 40:33.092
What's the use?

40:33.740 --> 40:34.650
I've got to go.

40:42.180 --> 40:43.010
Blousey.

40:44.380 --> 40:46.769
Where is she? Blousey.

41:14.580 --> 41:16.172
Show's going swell.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.138
Just the way I want it to be.

41:21.260 --> 41:23.251
Same number of
drinks, same everything.

41:24.100 --> 41:26.091
They mustn't know
they've got us on the run.

41:28.580 --> 41:29.979
Here, I wanna show you something.

41:31.820 --> 41:34.778
I've sent for someone to
help us out of our predicament.

41:35.220 --> 41:37.336
No ten-cent dummy. A specialist.

41:37.940 --> 41:38.736
A doctor?

41:39.260 --> 41:41.728
Not a doctor, a hoodlum.

41:42.860 --> 41:44.737
I thought we were hoodlums.

41:45.220 --> 41:47.859
Not a dumb bum. This
guy is the real McCoy.

41:48.340 --> 41:49.739
Not Looney Bergonzi!

41:49.900 --> 41:50.969
<i>The Looney Bergonzi?</i>

41:51.180 --> 41:54.775
The very same, mad
as a hatter, Bergonzi.

41:55.340 --> 41:57.934
Best man in Chicago.
Here's what we do.

41:58.580 --> 42:01.936
We meet Dandy Dan.
Looney hides in the back seat.

42:02.180 --> 42:03.659
- You drive.
- Right.

42:06.420 --> 42:08.331
- But I don't drive.
- You what?

42:10.020 --> 42:10.896
You don't drive?

42:11.820 --> 42:14.254
Then we get ourselves a driver.

42:22.180 --> 42:24.171
- Hi, Bugsy.
- Is Blousey there?

42:24.340 --> 42:26.296
- She won't see you.
- Tell her I'm sick.

42:26.500 --> 42:28.491
- You're sick?
- Sick of waiting.

42:32.740 --> 42:33.570
Beat it.

42:33.980 --> 42:35.652
Give a guy a break.

42:36.380 --> 42:37.415
I brought you some flowers.

42:37.860 --> 42:39.054
I'll see Tallulah gets them.

42:39.260 --> 42:41.410
Quit being smart. They're for you.

42:41.660 --> 42:42.649
Five minutes, girls.

42:42.900 --> 42:44.856
- I have to go.
- I was thinking of getting a job.

42:45.420 --> 42:47.251
You don't get paid for
standing in bread lines.

42:47.500 --> 42:51.732
A legit job. We could save
enough money to go to Hollywood.

42:51.940 --> 42:53.658
Believe it when I see it.

42:56.460 --> 42:58.815
- Bugsy, you drive?
- Sure, why?

42:59.140 --> 43:02.416
- Like to earn some green stuff?
- Long as it ain't cabbages.

43:02.820 --> 43:05.175
Step inside. I got
a proposition for you.

43:06.820 --> 43:07.969
Flowers? For me?

43:08.300 --> 43:10.097
How nice.

43:10.460 --> 43:12.257
Put these in water.

43:22.620 --> 43:23.416
Hello?

43:25.940 --> 43:29.330
Who shall I say is
calling? One moment.

43:58.380 --> 44:00.735
- Hello.
- Dandy Dan, is that you?

44:01.460 --> 44:04.020
- This is Dandy Dan speaking.
- I wanna arrange a meeting.

44:04.460 --> 44:07.611
- Sure. Where?
- Outta town.

44:07.820 --> 44:10.459
Agreed. Just you and a driver.

44:10.820 --> 44:14.096
- When?
- Monday. 11 A.M..

44:14.460 --> 44:15.449
Right, I'll be there.

44:16.180 --> 44:17.818
<i>Got him, the knuckle.</i>

44:18.260 --> 44:19.773
<i>Got him, the salami.</i>

44:19.940 --> 44:21.896
Let's go and enjoy the show.

44:31.780 --> 44:33.850
<i>My name is Tallulah...</i>

44:34.140 --> 44:35.892
<i>my first rule of thumb...</i>

44:36.420 --> 44:40.732
<i>I don't say where I'm going,
or where I'm coming from.</i>

44:41.100 --> 44:45.378
<i>I try to leave a little
reputation behind me...</i>

44:46.140 --> 44:50.179
<i>so if you really need to,
you'll know how to find me.</i>

44:59.340 --> 45:01.410
<i>My name is Tallulah...</i>

45:01.700 --> 45:03.452
<i>I live till I die...</i>

45:03.980 --> 45:05.254
<i>I'll take what you give me...</i>

45:05.420 --> 45:08.218
<i>and I won't ask why.</i>

45:08.620 --> 45:12.010
<i>I've made a lot of friends
in exotic places...</i>

45:13.220 --> 45:14.289
<i>I don't remember names...</i>

45:14.460 --> 45:17.770
<i>but I remember faces.</i>

45:27.020 --> 45:34.017
<i>Lonely, you don't
have to be lonely...</i>

45:36.300 --> 45:42.250
<i>come see Tallulah, we can
chase your troubles away.</i>

45:44.580 --> 45:47.890
<i>If you're lonely...</i>

45:48.060 --> 45:52.338
<i>you don't have to be lonely.</i>

45:53.740 --> 45:58.211
<i>When they talk to Tallulah,
you know what they say...</i>

45:58.980 --> 46:03.053
<i>no one south of heaven's
gonna treat you finer...</i>

46:03.380 --> 46:07.771
<i>Tallulah had her training
in North Carolina.</i>

46:16.860 --> 46:19.055
<i>My name is Tallulah...</i>

46:19.220 --> 46:20.892
<i>and soon I'll be gone...</i>

46:21.540 --> 46:25.579
<i>an open invitation
is the road I travel on.</i>

46:26.100 --> 46:30.412
<i>I never say goodbye
because the words upset me.</i>

46:30.740 --> 46:32.856
<i>You may forgive my going...</i>

46:33.020 --> 46:35.534
<i>but you won't forget me.</i>

46:44.460 --> 46:47.020
<i>Lonely...</i>

46:47.180 --> 46:51.537
<i>you don't have to be lonely...</i>

46:53.660 --> 46:59.337
<i>come see Tallulah, we can
chase your troubles away.</i>

47:01.940 --> 47:05.137
<i>If you're lonely...</i>

47:05.300 --> 47:09.896
<i>you don't have to be lonely...</i>

47:11.260 --> 47:15.458
<i>when they talk about Tallulah,
you know what they say...</i>

47:16.220 --> 47:20.338
<i>no one south of heaven's
gonna treat you finer...</i>

47:20.620 --> 47:25.296
<i>Tallulah had her training
in North Carolina.</i>

48:07.940 --> 48:08.531
They're coming.

48:08.980 --> 48:10.015
Looney, keep your head down.

48:31.980 --> 48:33.129
What can I do for you?

48:33.540 --> 48:35.576
How about some straight talk?

48:35.820 --> 48:36.730
Suits me.

48:36.900 --> 48:39.539
- You've been taking liberties.
- I've been taking what's mine.

48:39.700 --> 48:41.975
- Trouble is, it belongs to me.
- Too bad.

48:42.620 --> 48:45.737
I'm sure we can talk
it over. I'm a businessman.

48:46.060 --> 48:47.937
Yeah, a dime-a-dozen gangster.

48:48.180 --> 48:50.296
Button your lip.
Don't talk dirty to me.

48:50.460 --> 48:52.894
I don't like your
mouth. Have some respect.

48:53.260 --> 48:55.569
You'd slit your own
throat for two bits.

48:55.740 --> 48:57.571
Keep your wisecracks.

48:58.700 --> 48:59.689
Keep talking.

49:00.100 --> 49:01.931
I have my position to think of.

49:02.100 --> 49:04.216
Right now it's not worth a nickel.

49:04.380 --> 49:06.257
You're a dirty rat, Dan.

49:06.420 --> 49:08.536
You've been watching
too many movies.

49:09.380 --> 49:10.529
Okay, Looney, let him have it.

49:10.780 --> 49:12.418
Charlie, Yonkers,
it's a double-cross.

49:13.180 --> 49:14.932
Okay, freeze.

49:23.260 --> 49:23.851
Looney.

49:26.620 --> 49:28.178
What's the matter with you?

49:38.020 --> 49:38.975
Hey, you guys.

49:39.140 --> 49:39.970
Over here!

49:40.180 --> 49:41.169
Over here!

49:44.100 --> 49:45.738
Come back, dummies!
They're getting away.

49:46.180 --> 49:47.295
Come back here.

49:47.860 --> 49:51.569
Come on, step on it.

49:53.980 --> 49:55.049
Come on, let's go.

50:06.140 --> 50:07.334
We're going to lose them.

50:07.780 --> 50:08.929
Drive faster.

50:21.940 --> 50:22.929
Dan, you're a rat!

50:26.460 --> 50:27.779
You're a dirty rat!

50:28.100 --> 50:29.613
Come on, they're gonna get us.

50:38.580 --> 50:39.808
Hold tight, Mr. Stacetto.

51:04.140 --> 51:04.777
Come on, Malone.

51:06.260 --> 51:08.979
You're a dirty
double-crossing rat!

51:11.500 --> 51:12.091
Look out.

51:15.180 --> 51:15.771
Don't stop!

51:15.940 --> 51:16.656
There's a bridge!

51:16.860 --> 51:17.895
Put the brakes on!

51:21.060 --> 51:23.210
We lost them.

51:30.700 --> 51:34.056
Go and cluck somewhere else.

51:35.460 --> 51:38.179
Here. Get yourself a new suit.

51:39.100 --> 51:40.579
Get rid of the sack you're wearing.

51:41.020 --> 51:43.488
Thank you, Mr. Stacetto.

51:43.660 --> 51:45.491
Here's my tailor's card.

51:45.900 --> 51:47.856
You ain't got to
pay for six months.

51:48.460 --> 51:49.370
Thank you very much.

51:49.540 --> 51:52.816
Think nothing
of it. Let's go.

52:01.300 --> 52:03.291
What do you think?
Don't I look cute?

52:04.300 --> 52:04.937
I don't know.

52:05.220 --> 52:06.448
Come on, Dotty,
what do you think?

52:07.260 --> 52:09.057
I think the color's wrong.

52:09.260 --> 52:10.773
What are you talking about?

52:10.940 --> 52:12.692
Purple's my color.

52:13.220 --> 52:14.369
Don't I always wear purple?

52:14.540 --> 52:15.768
It matches your nose.

52:16.020 --> 52:16.975
Maybe it's the length.

52:17.380 --> 52:20.497
It's the latest length. Look!

52:20.660 --> 52:24.175
Maybe the frills stick out
too much. Like your ears.

52:24.940 --> 52:27.215
Frills are in. Look at
this photo of Lena Marelli.

52:27.420 --> 52:29.331
Lena Marelli is
not Bangles Dobell.

52:29.500 --> 52:31.695
You think it'd
look better on you?

52:31.860 --> 52:32.975
It'd look better on a horse.

52:33.380 --> 52:36.736
Jealous. Can I help it if my
looks are ahead of their time?

52:37.340 --> 52:38.216
What?

52:38.540 --> 52:39.290
Full of character.

52:39.500 --> 52:40.091
Kind of earthy.

52:40.260 --> 52:41.659
Like a bucket of mud.

52:42.260 --> 52:44.376
You creep. Get lost!

52:49.020 --> 52:51.409
How about you? Do you
think I look terrible?

52:54.100 --> 52:56.773
Do I look cute or terrible?

53:00.340 --> 53:00.931
Honestly?

53:01.740 --> 53:05.096
Bangles Dobell, you look terrible.

53:07.460 --> 53:08.370
What are you looking at?

53:09.340 --> 53:09.977
Nothing.

53:46.820 --> 53:47.457
<i>Blousey.</i>

53:54.700 --> 53:55.371
Blousey.

54:03.100 --> 54:03.771
Blousey.

54:04.780 --> 54:06.054
It's for you. It's Bugsy.

54:09.820 --> 54:10.775
Give him my love.

54:12.700 --> 54:13.291
Thanks.

54:14.060 --> 54:14.651
Hello.

54:15.020 --> 54:16.692
Blousey, it's Bugsy.

54:16.860 --> 54:17.451
Where are you?

54:17.620 --> 54:21.533
Around. I can't talk,
but I just made 200 bucks.

54:21.820 --> 54:23.139
You printed it yourself?

54:23.460 --> 54:24.609
No, I earned it.

54:24.860 --> 54:25.497
Doing what?

54:25.820 --> 54:26.616
Oh, this and that.

54:27.060 --> 54:28.288
Hang on a minute.

54:28.780 --> 54:29.769
I can't hear you.

54:29.940 --> 54:31.498
There's a train going by.

54:32.820 --> 54:33.730
Who gave you the money?

54:34.900 --> 54:35.491
Fat Sam.

54:35.780 --> 54:37.418
He gave you 200 dollars?

54:37.780 --> 54:39.657
And the loan of his
sedan for the afternoon.

54:39.980 --> 54:41.413
He loaned you his sedan?

54:41.900 --> 54:43.572
I don't believe it.
You're putting me on.

54:46.500 --> 54:47.296
I believe you.

54:49.940 --> 54:51.214
<i>He's a sinner...</i>

54:52.340 --> 54:54.092
<i>candy-coated...</i>

54:55.020 --> 54:59.093
<i>he always seems to be alone...</i>

55:00.620 --> 55:06.172
<i>but they love him,
Bugsy Malone.</i>

55:10.180 --> 55:11.659
<i>A city slicker...</i>

55:12.900 --> 55:15.653
<i>he can charm you with a smile...</i>

55:16.100 --> 55:18.694
<i>a style all his own...</i>

55:20.140 --> 55:23.291
<i>everybody loves that man...</i>

55:23.860 --> 55:26.818
<i>Bugsy Malone.</i>

55:33.300 --> 55:35.097
<i>Hard-headed Bugsy...</i>

55:35.260 --> 55:36.693
<i>makes his mind up...</i>

55:38.700 --> 55:41.692
<i>don't mess with Bugsy,
or you'll wind up...</i>

55:42.860 --> 55:46.773
<i>wishing you'd left him alone.</i>

55:47.940 --> 55:50.773
<i>He's a man, a mountain,
he's a rolling stone...</i>

55:53.140 --> 55:54.858
<i>and when he leaves you...</i>

55:55.740 --> 55:57.298
<i>sad and lonely...</i>

55:57.460 --> 55:59.655
<i>cry, I couldn't say.</i>

56:00.260 --> 56:01.773
<i>But it's known...</i>

56:02.900 --> 56:06.370
<i>that everybody
wants that man...</i>

56:06.780 --> 56:09.248
<i>Bugsy Malone.</i>

56:20.380 --> 56:21.972
Mustard with onions or ketchup?

56:22.140 --> 56:22.890
Mustard with onions.

56:23.500 --> 56:24.728
Oh, and this, too.

56:25.140 --> 56:27.290
- What's this?
- A present.

56:27.460 --> 56:28.688
- Open it up.
- You got to be kidding.

56:29.060 --> 56:30.049
I don't kid around.

56:30.580 --> 56:32.775
It's beautiful.

56:33.340 --> 56:33.931
Nice, huh?

56:34.100 --> 56:34.930
What is it?

56:35.300 --> 56:37.052
What is it? A viewer.

56:37.460 --> 56:38.973
Look through here.

56:39.420 --> 56:41.058
Pictures of Hollywood stars.

56:41.220 --> 56:42.050
Bugsy...

56:42.300 --> 56:44.530
it's fantastic. It really is.

56:45.300 --> 56:47.018
If only I could get to Hollywood.

56:47.260 --> 56:47.897
You can.

56:48.340 --> 56:48.977
Sure.

56:49.140 --> 56:50.209
I know, in the front row...

56:50.380 --> 56:51.290
of the Roxy Theatre...

56:51.460 --> 56:52.290
on East 38th Street.

56:52.460 --> 56:54.212
No, really get to Hollywood.

56:54.660 --> 56:55.490
Keep talking.

56:55.660 --> 56:56.888
1.80 for the viewer, right?

56:57.620 --> 56:58.939
10 cents for the hot dogs.

56:59.860 --> 57:02.374
Leaves 198 dollars for...

57:02.580 --> 57:03.171
Surprise me.

57:03.340 --> 57:04.773
- Two tickets.
- Two tickets?

57:05.180 --> 57:06.215
How many tickets you need?

57:06.580 --> 57:07.615
Two tickets to the ball game?

57:07.820 --> 57:09.139
To Hollywood, dummy.

57:09.780 --> 57:12.248
This can't be true.
Are we really going?

57:12.420 --> 57:13.409
Knock it off.

57:13.860 --> 57:14.690
You're putting me on.

57:15.140 --> 57:15.970
It's the honest truth.

57:16.540 --> 57:17.609
I'm picking them up tomorrow.

57:17.980 --> 57:20.414
Now I better get
Fat Sam's car back.

57:20.700 --> 57:21.928
Or I'm not going anywhere.

58:01.060 --> 58:01.936
Is anyone in there?

58:05.220 --> 58:05.811
Hello?

58:07.420 --> 58:08.011
Are you hurt?

58:11.500 --> 58:12.774
Help! Somebody
help me, please!

58:14.940 --> 58:15.895
Somebody, please!

58:16.060 --> 58:16.890
Somebody help!

58:18.260 --> 58:19.295
Help me, please!

58:33.020 --> 58:34.248
They take your money?

58:38.100 --> 58:39.852
Yeah. Nearly 200 dollars.

58:40.460 --> 58:42.769
Thanks anyway for helping me.

58:43.180 --> 58:43.851
It was nothing.

58:44.700 --> 58:46.497
- You must be a boxer, right?
- No.

58:47.060 --> 58:48.618
- You're not?
- No.

58:48.940 --> 58:50.419
Best punching I ever saw.

58:50.860 --> 58:52.418
- Ever been coached?
- No.

58:53.020 --> 58:54.817
- Ever thought of taking it up?
- No.

58:55.500 --> 58:57.456
Why not? You could be a champion.

58:58.060 --> 59:00.699
- Never had the chance.
- I know who could help you.

59:00.860 --> 59:02.816
- You know Cagey Joe?
- No.

59:03.340 --> 59:05.615
- You must know Slugger's Gym?
- No.

59:06.300 --> 59:08.860
- You don't know much, do you?
- Nope.

59:09.580 --> 59:10.569
What's your name?

59:10.780 --> 59:12.532
Smith, Leroy Smith.

59:12.980 --> 59:15.016
I'm Bugsy Malone. Put it there.

59:15.660 --> 59:16.854
You got yourself a manager.

59:18.180 --> 59:20.455
- Know the first thing I'm gonna do?
- No.

59:20.620 --> 59:23.134
Treat you to one heck of a meal.

59:23.340 --> 59:26.138
- Thought they took all your dough.
- Who needs money?

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.816
Look at this, O'Dreary.

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.530
You cracked it this time, Captain.

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.618
Get the plaster.
We'll take a mold.

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:37.168
Come on, get the plaster.

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:41.849
Careful. Up a bit.

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:46.293
Left a bit.

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:47.336
Come on, hurry up.

01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:50.134
Hold it straight. Be careful.

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.294
You idiots!

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:02.849
Hello. What?

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:06.496
They got the still.
The whole lot's gone.

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:10.216
Not the sarsaparilla racket,
too. Get round here now.

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:11.973
- I can't, boss.
- Why not?

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.376
I'm all tied up.

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:15.930
I don't care if you're
busy. Get here right away.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:21.053
Careful, you idiots.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:22.330
O'Dreary.

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:23.291
Don't worry...

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:26.054
we'll break you out
at headquarters.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:40.778
- Hi, Bugsy. How you been?
- Swell, Cagey Joe.

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.979
I'd like you to meet the
next heavyweight champion.

01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:45.653
Leroy, meet Cagey Joe.

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.175
Cagey Joe, this is Leroy Smith.

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:51.094
- Ever been in the ring before?
- No.

01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:53.736
- So you wanna be a fighter?
- No.

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:56.095
Sure he does. He's a natural.

01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.450
Look at those fists.

01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:58.855
Did you ever see such fists?

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:00.011
Hit it, Leroy.

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:04.498
You see? A born champion.

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:06.010
What's your name again?

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.058
Smith. Leroy Smith.

01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:10.729
With your help...

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.419
he could be champion in no time.

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:24.131
<i>So you wanna be a boxer...</i>

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.859
<i>in the golden ring.</i>

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:28.736
<i>Can you punch like a train?</i>

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:30.135
<i>Tell me just one thing...</i>

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.698
<i>can you move like a
hummingbird's wing?</i>

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:35.015
<i>Oh, that's fast!</i>

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:38.092
<i>Can you bob, can you weave?</i>

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:40.737
<i>Well, you might as well quit...</i>

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.374
<i>if you haven't got it.</i>

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:47.777
<i>So you wanna be a boxer,
can you pass the test?</i>

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:52.137
<i>I can tell if you got it,
I've trained the best.</i>

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:57.009
<i>When you work and sweat
like a buzz saw...</i>

01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.408
<i>and you near lose your mind...</i>

01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:00.332
<i>when you find out your
boy has a glass jaw.</i>

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:02.334
<i>So you might as well quit...</i>

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:04.488
<i>if you haven't got it.</i>

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:08.257
<i>Put him in the ring,
look at what you've found...</i>

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:09.489
<i>we can use the fun...</i>

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:10.376
<i>pushing him around.</i>

01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.019
<i>We'll show him the ropes...</i>

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:14.338
<i>and destroy his hopes...</i>

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:16.130
<i>put him in the ring...</i>

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.416
<i>let him feel the sting...</i>

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:19.251
<i>we can make him dance...</i>

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:20.853
<i>we'll pound him to bits...</i>

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.810
<i>then he'll call it quits.</i>

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:29.977
Come on, Leroy.

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:36.690
<i>So you wanna be a boxer,
wanna be the champ...</i>

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:41.369
<i>there's a golden boy inside
you, not a punchy tramp...</i>

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:44.618
<i>if you listen and you learn,
there's an honor you can earn...</i>

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:49.092
<i>when you see the crown,
you're a king, not a clown.</i>

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:51.208
<i>But you might as well quit...</i>

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:53.368
<i>if you haven't got it.</i>

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:57.131
<i>Put him in the ring,
something new to punch...</i>

01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:59.251
<i>let me have a swing...</i>

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:00.773
<i>then we'll go to lunch...</i>

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.059
<i>then he'll get the drift.</i>

01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.897
<i>Put him in the ring,
chicken à la carte...</i>

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:08.057
<i>let me have a wing,
tearing him apart.</i>

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:09.619
<i>The chicken will crow...</i>

01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:13.451
<i>let me have him, Joe.</i>

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.137
He's got it.

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:35.450
You sure this is going to work?

01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:38.300
Sure. Looks like a splurge gun.

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:39.251
Doesn't it?

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:43.288
- Sort of.
- Nonsense.

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:46.777
Anything Dandy Dan can
do, I can do better.

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:48.850
Are you ready?

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:49.811
Ready.

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:52.855
Don't do that!

01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:53.896
Sorry, boss.

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:55.170
All right, take aim.

01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:58.691
Ready.

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:03.691
Get set.

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:06.731
Fire.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:12.211
Missed!

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:14.532
Back to the drawing board.

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:17.456
Knuckles!

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.055
Knuckles, speak to me.

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:19.811
Knuckles.

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.728
It's all your fault, hear me?

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:55.651
Hello?

01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:59.496
Not the grocery racket, too?

01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:01.811
Yeah.

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:06.934
That's the whole empire
gone. Hear me? Everything.

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.653
They'll be coming here next.

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.255
There's only one thing for it.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.811
You have to get him to help me.

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.415
Who? The Lone Ranger?

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:18.969
No, Bugsy Malone. Call him.

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:25.853
I'm in trouble, and all I got for
company is a female comedienne.

01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.450
I'm in trouble, bad trouble.

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:30.411
Is he there?

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:32.768
No. There's no answer.

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.452
<i>Then get him to me poysanally.</i>

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:36.771
Personally?

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:40.896
<i>- Poysanally.
- Poysanally.</i>

01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:47.255
So long, lover boy.

01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:13.779
I like men at my feet.

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:15.534
What you doing here?

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:17.089
I brought you a message.

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:19.259
What's wrong with Western Union?

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.099
Thought you'd like the company.

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:24.538
I'll buy you a drink.

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:25.371
Where?

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:27.295
How about Fat Sam's?

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:29.611
Won't he be there?

01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:30.611
He sure will.

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.772
Maybe I'll stay home.

01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:35.338
Don't flatter yourself...

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:36.410
it's him that wants to see you.

01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:37.651
Come on.

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.091
Before your suspenders strangle you.

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:03.770
Quit whistling, it makes me edgy.

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:04.611
Yes, boss.

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:08.616
- Pour me a double on the rocks.
- Sure, boss.

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.376
What's funny? You find me amusing?

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:21.140
I wasn't smiling at you.

01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:22.015
Honest, I wasn't.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:23.578
You find my suit funny?

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:24.331
No, boss.

01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:25.296
It was your flower.

01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:29.330
Yeah, it is kinda droopy.

01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:30.576
Yeah, a little.

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:32.779
In fact, it's very droopy.

01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:34.738
Very droopy, boss.

01:08:35.939 --> 01:08:36.850
Hold it a minute.

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:38.529
It needs some water.

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:42.372
Don't ever laugh at me again...

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.053
or I'll ram that
smile down your throat.

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:47.890
I'm Fat Sam, don't forget
that. Number one man, Mr. Big.

01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:50.256
Always have been,
always will be. Now get out.

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.176
Careful, the floor is wet.

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:07.211
Hi, honey.

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:08.810
Here he is.

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:10.249
Hey, Bugsy.

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:11.176
How you doing, Sam?

01:09:11.819 --> 01:09:13.252
Glad to see you.

01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:16.977
Pull up a chair.

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.050
Fix him a drink.

01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:20.256
A special on the rocks.

01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.135
What can I do for you?

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:23.890
Bugsy...

01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:24.731
I'm in a jam.

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:29.897
Dandy Dan's gonna take
over my organization.

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:31.448
You still got this.

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:34.417
If Dan gets his way,
I won't have a dime.

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:39.649
Can you leave us alone?
This is men's talk.

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.136
That's all right,
I'm unshockable.

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:43.170
Go fix your make-up.

01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:44.768
I've already fixed it.

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:47.210
Then go make yourself
look more beautiful.

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:49.773
You know that's impossible.

01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:51.290
Anything's possible.

01:09:52.819 --> 01:09:54.651
I'll go and manicure my gloves.

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:01.770
Bugsy, believe me...

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:04.654
my gang's gone. My
business is in ruins.

01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:06.534
My friends don't wanna know me.

01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:07.771
I'm a wreck.

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:11.013
In short, I need your help.

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:12.171
Why me?

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:16.169
'Cause you've got
brains, not pretzels.

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:19.012
No, it's not my line.

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:27.610
400 dollars.

01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:29.856
Do we have a deal?

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:31.531
Hello?

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:34.897
Bugsy, it's for you.

01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:36.375
I think it's Blousey.

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:38.211
You got a deal.

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.212
Hold on, he won't be a second.

01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:43.850
See you, Bugsy.

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:47.370
Hello, Blousey.

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:48.736
What are you doing there?

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:49.611
Just business.

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:50.730
With Tallulah?

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.659
No, with Fat Sam.

01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:54.016
Did you get the tickets?

01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.768
No, you see...

01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:57.895
You promised me.

01:10:58.060 --> 01:10:58.651
I know.

01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:00.657
But Hollywood can wait, can't it?

01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:03.095
You had no intention of
taking me to Hollywood!

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:06.570
I do! But there's something
I've got to do first.

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:08.294
You promised me.

01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:11.812
Trust me. I can't
talk now. I'll call you.

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:16.534
<i>Only a fool...</i>

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:20.534
<i>like fools before me...</i>

01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:28.172
<i>I always think with my heart.</i>

01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:33.095
<i>Only a fool...</i>

01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:37.219
<i>that same old story...</i>

01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:44.414
<i>seems I was born
for the part.</i>

01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:48.255
<i>It's a lesson that I've learned...</i>

01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:53.331
<i>and a page I should have turned.</i>

01:11:54.340 --> 01:12:00.939
<i>I shouldn't cry, but I do.</i>

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:05.093
<i>Like an ordinary fool...</i>

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:10.937
<i>when her ordinary
dreams fall through.</i>

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:26.808
<i>How many times have I mistaken...</i>

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:29.015
What can you see?

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:43.693
<i>How many times have I mistaken...</i>

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:50.539
<i>love songs and laughs
for the blues.</i>

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:54.939
<i>When a road I've walked before...</i>

01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:59.697
<i>ends alone at my door...</i>

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:07.169
<i>I shouldn't cry, but I do...</i>

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:15.975
<i>when my ordinary dreams
fall through.</i>

01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:21.932
- Splurge guns!
- Where?

01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:24.808
In the crates. Look
what it says on the truck.

01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:25.571
I can't.

01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:26.530
Can't you read?

01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:29.334
Sure. But I'm short-
sighted. What's it say?

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:32.738
It says: Splurge
Imports Incorporated.

01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:35.371
Dock 17, East River.

01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:38.010
- Must be where the guns are.
- Right.

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:41.011
Look out!

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:44.138
<i>It's a lesson that I've learned...</i>

01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:49.130
<i>and a page I should have turned...</i>

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:56.019
<i>I shouldn't cry but I do...</i>

01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:00.379
<i>like an ordinary fool...</i>

01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:08.214
<i>when her ordinary
dreams fall through.</i>

01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:13.734
Blousey, miss your train?

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:15.492
What have I done?
Bugsy let you down?

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:17.893
The broad needs her head testing.

01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:19.015
You better believe it.

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:22.496
Oh, yeah.

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:24.617
Can I have my job back?

01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:28.690
Sure, the more
the merrier. Go right in.

01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:31.489
Hi, Blousey.

01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:32.697
Hi, Blousey.

01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:35.930
Ever see a broad
carry a torch so high?

01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:38.975
Yeah, the Statue of Liberty.

01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:51.529
This must be the place.

01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:54.855
Two guards on the door.

01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:56.376
Two on the roof.

01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:57.816
Two on the pier.

01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:00.451
- What we gonna do?
- Go home?

01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:01.729
There must be a way in.

01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:03.612
Don't be stupid. We'll never get...

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:04.417
past them.

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:07.211
You're right. Let's go.

01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:11.059
What we gonna do, Leroy?

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:13.369
We need more men.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:15.699
We need an army.

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:17.858
No armies around here.

01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:18.611
Yeah, I know.

01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:26.889
Hang on a minute.

01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:51.975
<i>Don't complain about the way
your life has wound up...</i>

01:15:54.980 --> 01:16:00.213
<i>think of all the time you waste,
and time's a precious thing...</i>

01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:07.854
<i>sure you've hit the bottom,
but remember you're building up...</i>

01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:15.336
<i>every day's another step that
takes you closer to the sky...</i>

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:17.816
<i>so give it a try.</i>

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:31.419
<i>Don't be depressed about
the way luck deceived you...</i>

01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:36.051
<i>fortune sailed away,
you missed the boat...</i>

01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:39.018
<i>and found you'd been left behind.</i>

01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:40.454
What's the matter with you?

01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:46.928
<i>Fight and fight some more,
till the world receives you...</i>

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:54.574
<i>Lady Luck is fickle, but
a lady can change her mind.</i>

01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:58.859
Come on, guys, who's with me?

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.009
No!

01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:01.619
What's the matter with you?

01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:03.215
All right, here's somebody.

01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:04.370
Me too.

01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:06.098
What about the rest of you?

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:07.056
And you?

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:08.411
Why not?

01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:10.971
Come on.

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:14.529
<i>Don't sit around complaining...</i>

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:17.339
<i>about how your life's wound up...</i>

01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:25.093
<i>be a man, you can't be certain
you'll lose till you try.</i>

01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:47.853
<i>Don't sit around complaining
about how your life's wound up...</i>

01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:53.176
<i>you can't be certain you'll lose...</i>

01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:54.932
<i>till you try.</i>

01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:57.415
<i>So give it a try.</i>

01:17:58.060 --> 01:17:59.288
- Is everybody with me?
- Yeah!

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:00.771
Come on.

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:30.169
There they are.

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:31.290
This is what we'll do.

01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:32.816
Get Baby Face.

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:33.571
Get Baby Face.

01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:48.491
Get Baby Face.

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:51.971
I'm Baby Face. What am I saying?

01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:53.489
I gotta have courage.

01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:55.379
Give this to Baby Face.

01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:57.577
Big courage.

01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:58.530
Give it to Baby Face.

01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:02.379
Thanks. Just what I need.

01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:04.218
Okay, you know what to do.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:05.616
I'm scared.

01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:07.459
Will you get out there!

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.571
Yeah, right, get out there.

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.377
I'm a big movie star now.

01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:50.094
Geronimo!

01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:52.331
Get that guy.

01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:56.010
Dummies.

01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:58.213
Come back here.

01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:20.257
Come on, open the boxes.

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:44.571
<i>My name is Tallulah,
my first rule of thumb...</i>

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:46.458
Stop fooling around.

01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:47.656
Sorry, Bugsy.

01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:52.692
I don't have to tell you
how important this is.

01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:56.849
This is gonna take
the lid off City Hall.

01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:59.536
- This is the big one.
- The big one.

01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:01.418
The shake-down.

01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:03.212
The shake-down.

01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:05.491
The pay-off.

01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:07.336
The pay off.

01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:08.770
It's got to be good.

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:12.014
It's got to be good,
it's got to be neat...

01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:13.619
Quit repeating everything!

01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:16.815
You shouldn't have any trouble.

01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:21.251
Just Fat Sam and
a few dance hall girls.

01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:25.177
Good luck and off we go.

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:27.774
Three cheers for Dandy Dan.

01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:29.499
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:31.133
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:32.813
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:34.618
Too kind, guys.

01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:09.613
Jelly, Jelly, open up!

01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:13.054
They're here!

01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:18.491
Just act normal.

01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:20.135
Get to work.

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:22.214
Girls, off you go.

01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:24.378
Razzmatazz, let's
hear some music.

01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:42.376
Okay, this is our moment.

01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:45.370
Keep a cool head and
keep those fingers pumping.

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:48.608
Remember, you'll be writing history.

01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:53.739
<i>Fat Sam ain't humble...</i>

01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:56.090
<i>but it's your home sweet home...</i>

01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:57.494
<i>plans are made here...</i>

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:01.259
Okay, everybody, freeze.

01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:04.092
Let them have it.

01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:56.490
Amazing scenes...

01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:58.457
have been reported
on the lower East side.

01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:01.251
It's been a frightful bad show.

01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.134
So, this is show business?

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:47.978
<i>We could've been
anything we wanted...</i>

01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:53.568
<i>and it's not too
late to change...</i>

01:24:56.780 --> 01:25:00.250
<i>I'd be delighted...</i>

01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:01.853
<i>to give it some thought...</i>

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:06.969
<i>maybe you'll agree
that we really ought...</i>

01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:13.938
<i>We could've been
anything we wanted...</i>

01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:18.691
<i>that decision is ours...</i>

01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:24.973
<i>it's been decided,
we're weaker divided...</i>

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:29.017
<i>let friendship
double our powers.</i>

01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:35.976
<i>We could've been
anything we wanted...</i>

01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:39.574
<i>and I'm not saying we should...</i>

01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:45.209
<i>but if we tried it...</i>

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:47.728
<i>we could be the best...</i>

01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:49.891
<i>at being good guys.</i>

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:51.653
<i>Flowers of the earth...</i>

01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:54.137
<i>who can guess how much...</i>

01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:56.370
<i>a real friend is worth.</i>

01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:58.531
<i>Good guys...</i>

01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:00.372
<i>shake an open hand...</i>

01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:02.738
<i>maybe we'll be trusting...</i>

01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:04.811
<i>if we try to understand.</i>

01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:06.814
<i>No doubt about it...</i>

01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:08.936
<i>it must be worthwhile...</i>

01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:12.812
<i>friends tend to make you smile.</i>

01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:17.613
<i>We could've been anything...</i>

01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:19.850
<i>that we wanted to be.</i>

01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:23.298
<i>That decision is ours.</i>

01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:25.973
<i>It's been decided...</i>

01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:28.137
<i>we're weaker divided...</i>

01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:31.738
<i>let friendship
double our powers.</i>

01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:39.450
<i>You give a little love
and it all comes back to you.</i>

01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:47.529
<i>You know you'll be remembered
for the things you say and do.</i>

01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:54.616
<i>You give a little love
and it all comes back to you.</i>

01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:03.972
<i>You'll be remembered for
the things you say and do.</i>

01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:12.257

01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:20.249
<i>You'll be remembered

01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:25.459
<i>You give a little love...</i>

01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:28.293
