WEBVTT

00:02.872 --> 00:06.832
Uh, the truth is, my father
was a very flawed parent

00:06.876 --> 00:09.183
and a very flawed husband.

00:09.226 --> 00:12.273
Heck, he was very flawed man.

00:13.056 --> 00:15.450
But that did not stop him

00:15.493 --> 00:19.062
from trying his level best
at all three.

00:23.153 --> 00:25.938
You were a complicated man, sir.

00:25.982 --> 00:30.291
But you very lived hard
and in that passion for life.

00:30.334 --> 00:32.771
Well, therein lies the lesson

00:32.815 --> 00:36.253
for those of us that --
that you left behind.

00:36.297 --> 00:39.169
Wow.

00:39.213 --> 00:41.824
First I was like, "Where
is he going with this
George Brett story?"

00:41.867 --> 00:43.869
But you really tied it
together really nicely.

00:43.913 --> 00:46.785
Yeah. It's what I call an LBA --
a Load-Bearing Anecdote.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.787
I thought
you hated your father.

00:48.831 --> 00:50.485
Oh, I do. I did.

00:50.528 --> 00:53.357
He treated me and my sister
like we were an old dirty napkin

00:53.401 --> 00:55.446
that you'd use to pick up
a piece of dog shit

00:55.490 --> 00:56.882
by the side of the road.

00:56.926 --> 01:00.060
But you know, he's gone,
so time to move on.

01:00.103 --> 01:03.672
This is more emotional maturity
than I'd expect from you.

01:03.715 --> 01:05.239
I'm in a pretty good place,
Charles.

01:05.282 --> 01:08.111
I mean, not in terms of
my career or my love life

01:08.155 --> 01:10.635
or the frequency of
my bowel movements.

01:10.679 --> 01:12.289
But I've made peace
with my past.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.204
You know, seeing Lucy last year,
that taught me

01:14.248 --> 01:16.337
that your past can only
hurt you if you let it.

01:16.380 --> 01:19.122
This eulogy, this is, uh --
It's my opportunity

01:19.166 --> 01:22.560
to show my family just exactly
how much I have matured.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.781
We have a game
in two hours.

01:25.824 --> 01:28.479
Shit. Well,
better perk up then, huh?

01:29.959 --> 01:33.049
Hey, you know, if the funeral
is on Monday,

01:33.093 --> 01:36.966
you're gonna have to
miss a game.

01:37.009 --> 01:38.837
And Raj is gonna have to
replace you.

01:38.881 --> 01:41.797
Really?
Well, what can I say?

01:41.840 --> 01:44.626
Some things are just
a little bit more
important than baseball.

01:44.669 --> 01:47.194
I'm...proud of you.

01:48.586 --> 01:51.415
Is that a binder
full of eulogies?

01:51.459 --> 01:54.331
Oh, yes, Charles. Part of my job
as a seasoned orator

01:54.375 --> 01:56.681
is to be able to speak
eloquently about the dead

01:56.725 --> 01:58.422
on a moment's notice.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.120

are you doing here?

Well, you know,
great to see you, too.

I told you Dad died

I'm not here to make a scene,
I promise.

I let go of my anger at Dad
a long time ago.

I -- You know, I-I've put
the past behind me, Jean.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.629
Yeah?
Well, I haven't.

03:58.673 --> 04:01.023
Your meltdown
made me a laughingstock,

04:01.066 --> 04:03.591
brought shame
to the Brockmire name.

I'm sorry I brought shame
to House Brockmire, Jean.

Boy, I didn't realize
we were in Winterfell here.

have my husband's name.

Isn't Norm's last name
Glasscock?

04:15.211 --> 04:17.125
Yeah.

04:17.168 --> 04:19.563
My grandson Harry
has a scar

04:19.607 --> 04:21.870
where a bully
threw a glass dildo at his head.

04:21.913 --> 04:23.219
Do you know how hard it is

04:23.263 --> 04:25.308
to find a glass dildo
in the Ozarks?

04:25.352 --> 04:27.789
The kid's full name
is Harry Glasscock?

04:27.832 --> 04:29.573
Yeah. And still,

04:29.617 --> 04:32.620
his life is still better than
if it were Harry Brockmire.

04:32.663 --> 04:36.798
My only comfort is the Brockmire
name dies with you.

04:36.841 --> 04:38.234
Boy.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.149
For a funeral,
this is getting pretty dark.

04:40.192 --> 04:41.846
No one asked you to come.

04:41.890 --> 04:44.458
I have a right to be --
He's my father, too, okay?

04:44.501 --> 04:46.460
And I seem to remember,
back in the day, you people

04:46.503 --> 04:48.288
were all over me
when you wanted something,

04:48.331 --> 04:51.378
like, uh, Royals tickets
or bail money

04:51.421 --> 04:53.467
or Dan Quisenberry-autographed
cleats.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.382
But as soon as my life
went into the toilet,

04:55.425 --> 04:57.122
y'all were nowhere to be found,
huh?

04:57.166 --> 04:58.428
You know, believe it or not,
I was going through

04:58.472 --> 05:00.169
quite a lot back then.
Oh.

05:00.212 --> 05:01.953
Could've used -- Yeah, could've
used a little bit of support.

05:01.997 --> 05:04.260
You were going
through a lot?
Yeah!

05:04.304 --> 05:07.350
Norm has had prostate cancer
twice.

05:07.394 --> 05:10.135
My daughter abandoned
my grandson on the doorstep.

05:10.179 --> 05:12.312
And when Dad he got sick,
he moved in here.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.488
If you think he was an asshole
when he was living,

05:14.531 --> 05:17.229
he really kicked it up a notch
when he was dying.

05:17.273 --> 05:20.929
Plus...I'm a homosexual.

05:22.191 --> 05:23.627
Holy shit, Jean.

05:23.671 --> 05:26.369
I mean, I-I knew you were gay,
I just --

05:26.413 --> 05:28.023
I didn't know
that you knew.

05:28.066 --> 05:30.678
Of course I knew.
What was I gonna do about it?

05:30.721 --> 05:33.681
After a botched epidural
on my third kid,

05:33.724 --> 05:36.379
I lost all feeling
in my vagina.

05:36.423 --> 05:39.817
Plus, I'm a middle-aged woman
living in the Ozarks.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.732
Well, fair enough.

05:41.776 --> 05:44.474
Looks like life dealt us both
a pretty bad poker hand,

05:44.518 --> 05:46.781
and, uh, it turns out
we were playing UNO, huh?

05:46.824 --> 05:49.392
The difference is
I don't whine about it.

05:49.436 --> 05:52.482
You know, of course life sucks.
You just gotta put one foot
in front of the other

05:52.526 --> 05:55.050
and carry your burdens on
your back until they crush you.

05:55.093 --> 05:57.400
You don't get on a microphone
and cry about it

05:57.444 --> 05:59.054
like a little bitch.

05:59.097 --> 06:01.273
Norm?

06:01.317 --> 06:02.971

06:05.234 --> 06:06.714
Hey.

Jim?

06:08.019 --> 06:10.892
Hey, Norm.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.332
Why, I see, uh, he's still
quite the chatty Cathy, huh?

06:16.376 --> 06:18.508
Unlike some people,
Norm doesn't talk

06:18.552 --> 06:20.423
unless he has something
to say.

06:20.467 --> 06:23.034
He's a great man.
He is my rock.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.775
Norm, hon?

06:24.819 --> 06:28.605
I love you...
like the brother I never had.

06:30.259 --> 06:32.087
Okay, I can see that
this weekend's

06:32.130 --> 06:34.742
turning into a series
of body blows to ol' Jim.

06:34.785 --> 06:38.180
So, uh, I'm gonna need biblical
amounts of booze, Jean.

06:38.223 --> 06:40.835
Not particular.
Any of your grain-based alcohols

06:40.878 --> 06:42.271
will do very nicely.

06:42.314 --> 06:46.884
Um, scotch, whiskey,
rye, bourbon, whatever.

06:46.928 --> 06:48.582
Vodka?

06:48.625 --> 06:50.584
How 'bout gin?
I mean, it's primarily a berry.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.890
This is a dry house.

that somebody should get up here

at least resembled the truth.

16:45.352 --> 16:47.832

as he was just this --

17:02.760 --> 17:05.807
this angry creep
who would stalk around the house

17:05.849 --> 17:07.416
on evenings and weekends.

17:07.461 --> 17:09.637
So he tried to find some peace
every day

17:09.680 --> 17:12.074
during what he called
"Tiki Time."

17:12.117 --> 17:16.339
Tiki Time was when he'd go out
to this old bamboo bar

17:16.383 --> 17:18.298
that he had constructed
out in the garage,

17:18.340 --> 17:20.387
and he would throw back Mai Tais
out there.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.388
Now, we never were allowed
to disturb him then

17:22.432 --> 17:26.915
because, as Dad liked to put it,
Tiki Time was paradise.

17:26.958 --> 17:30.310
But one night,
I desecrated Tiki Time

17:30.353 --> 17:32.355
when I went out there to
tell him that he had forgotten

17:32.399 --> 17:34.401
to feed us kids dinner
that night.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.838
So, he stormed back
into the house,

17:36.881 --> 17:38.448
and he nuked up some fish sticks

17:38.492 --> 17:40.102
till they were just
hotter than the sun,

17:40.146 --> 17:42.104
and then screamed into our faces

17:42.148 --> 17:44.715
when we wanted to wait
for them to cool down.

17:51.374 --> 17:52.984
I don't remember anything
after that

17:53.028 --> 17:55.465
except for, well, waking up
in the emergency room,

17:55.509 --> 17:58.729
where Jean and I
had, uh, third-degree burns.

18:00.122 --> 18:03.952
I guess things might've been
easier if Mom had stuck around,

18:03.995 --> 18:05.867

I never blamed her leaving.

18:05.910 --> 18:08.130

18:20.577 --> 18:22.275
I don't know how you did that.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.146
