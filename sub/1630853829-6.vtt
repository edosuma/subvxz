00:15.130 --> 00:17.234
<i>
Can you make sure it's level?</i>

00:20.440 --> 00:22.345
Is it straight?

00:22.378 --> 00:23.715
- Hmm.
- Yeah, it looks fine.

00:23.748 --> 00:24.717
Looks straight.

00:24.750 --> 00:26.854
Can I go now?

00:26.887 --> 00:28.725
You think you can throw a party

00:28.758 --> 00:30.227
in our house
and no one's gonna find out?

00:30.260 --> 00:31.864
You're staying.

00:31.897 --> 00:33.501
- - Besides, I
invited all your friends.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.070
Cheese, Willie Jack, Elora.

00:36.607 --> 00:38.811
You and Elora okay?

00:38.844 --> 00:40.515
Eh.

00:40.548 --> 00:42.285
Just some old shit
she hasn't apologized for yet.

00:42.318 --> 00:44.523
- It's pretty weird.

00:44.556 --> 00:47.529
I'm sure you guys will be fine.

00:47.562 --> 00:49.833
Well, if she does it again,
we're done.

00:52.137 --> 00:53.675
If you say so.

00:53.708 --> 00:56.078
But trust me,
that's not how family works.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.151
Hmm.

01:00.855 --> 01:03.126
"NARDS."

01:11.777 --> 01:13.614
Wake up, pup.

01:17.421 --> 01:19.492
They start handing out
gift cards or what?

01:19.526 --> 01:21.396
What gift cards?

01:21.429 --> 01:22.733
I don't know. Sonics.

01:22.766 --> 01:24.435
- Right, Cheese?
- Yeah.

01:24.468 --> 01:26.439
- 15 bucks.
- 15 bu...

01:26.472 --> 01:27.576
Twofer Tuesdays.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.178
We're going there after.

01:29.211 --> 01:31.149
This is my first time
hearin' about this.

01:31.182 --> 01:32.317
It's the only
reason why we came here, Bear.

01:33.654 --> 01:35.323
Elora.

01:37.862 --> 01:39.465
Where do you want to sit?

01:39.498 --> 01:40.601
Oh.

01:41.670 --> 01:43.173
Come on, it's okay.

01:43.206 --> 01:45.678
She has
her own friends, fawk.

01:51.590 --> 01:54.228
I'm not getting lice. Fuck.

01:56.432 --> 01:59.205
Hi, welcome!

01:59.238 --> 02:01.510
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

02:02.512 --> 02:04.382
- Use this.
- I don't need that.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.252
Then why did we buy it, then?

02:06.285 --> 02:07.421
Okay.

02:07.454 --> 02:09.693
- Welcome.

02:09.726 --> 02:11.396
Eesh.

02:11.429 --> 02:13.668
- Yo, fawk.
- Okay.

02:13.701 --> 02:14.837
Oh, my God.

02:14.870 --> 02:16.807
Welcome, everyone.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.780
Thank you so much for coming
to our annual youth summit,

02:19.813 --> 02:23.721
"Native American Reclamation
and Decolonization Symposium."

02:23.754 --> 02:24.923
- NARDS!

02:27.327 --> 02:29.700
I would like to bring up
Elder Fixico

02:29.733 --> 02:32.506
to start us off
with an opening ceremony.

02:35.611 --> 02:37.849
Oh, no, no, no.

02:37.882 --> 02:39.451
- Use the mic.
- No.

02:40.822 --> 02:42.659
Would everyone please stand?

02:42.692 --> 02:44.461
Take hands.

02:47.769 --> 02:51.309
We stand here as the first
people to walk on this land.

02:51.342 --> 02:54.783
The greedy whites
took our lands.

02:56.954 --> 02:59.827
Well, maybe another time.

02:59.860 --> 03:02.532
We must honor
the four directions.

03:02.565 --> 03:04.736
Let us face the East,

03:04.769 --> 03:07.374
where our relative here
is from as well,

03:07.407 --> 03:09.980
and greet our Grandfather Sun.

03:10.013 --> 03:12.384
Let us face the South,

03:12.417 --> 03:14.857
and honor
our southern relatives--

03:14.890 --> 03:18.531
Mexico and
Central and South America.

03:18.564 --> 03:19.766
Let us face the North.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.606
Just pick a way. Pick a way.

03:22.639 --> 03:24.676
- Uh... I'm not sure...
-: It's this way.

03:24.709 --> 03:26.781
I hope you're as excited
as I am today

03:26.814 --> 03:29.987
to welcome two
outstanding role models.

03:30.020 --> 03:32.626
I've been DMing them
for the past two years,

03:32.659 --> 03:34.028
and I'm excited
for the opportunity

03:34.061 --> 03:35.865
to have them on our reservation.

03:35.898 --> 03:38.938
MissM8tri@rch and Augusto
Firekeeper.

03:38.971 --> 03:40.440
<i>Aho!</i>

03:43.814 --> 03:47.354
<i>Hau. Hau. Anpetu waste,</i>
my young relatives.

03:47.387 --> 03:49.560
MissM8tri@rch <i>imaciapiyelo.</i>

03:49.593 --> 03:53.901
I am a PhD student at Dartmouth.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.574
An auntie, a beader,

03:56.607 --> 03:58.511
a... a sister

03:58.544 --> 04:00.414
and a friend.

04:00.447 --> 04:02.017
But before we get started today,
I want to take a moment

04:02.050 --> 04:04.890
to acknowledge the traditional
caretakers of this land,

04:04.923 --> 04:08.798
the Caddo, the Osage,
and the Muscogee, of course.

04:08.831 --> 04:12.539
But before them were
our Neanderthal relatives,

04:12.572 --> 04:14.576
so acknowledge them.

04:14.609 --> 04:15.912
And before that, even,

04:15.945 --> 04:19.887
the Dinosaur Nation,
Dinosaur Oyate, you know?

04:19.920 --> 04:22.859
- Before that, the Star People.
- Mm.

04:22.892 --> 04:24.428
Also, our reptilian relatives,

04:24.461 --> 04:26.499
- above and below earth.
- Mm.

04:26.533 --> 04:29.706
Yeah. And the people
who will come after us

04:29.739 --> 04:32.612
and take care of this land
once we are gone,

04:32.645 --> 04:34.081
because, someday,
we will die.

04:34.114 --> 04:36.554
So just blessings everywhere.

04:36.587 --> 04:39.593
Uh...

04:39.626 --> 04:42.598
...for having me
in your sacred space today.

04:49.512 --> 04:52.619
Before I say anything,
I want to say some things.

04:52.652 --> 04:55.558
Name is Augusto Firekeeper.

04:55.591 --> 04:57.428
Now, it's not traditional for me

04:57.461 --> 04:59.432
to talk about
my accomplishments,

04:59.465 --> 05:02.071
but what I can say is
I'm a actor,

05:02.104 --> 05:04.576
model, poet,

05:04.609 --> 05:05.678
hatmaker.

05:05.711 --> 05:07.616
Good one, at that.

05:07.649 --> 05:10.688
Normally, I couldn't say
this about myself.

05:10.721 --> 05:14.495
But others have said it,
so I'll say it.

05:14.529 --> 05:16.498
- I'm a young elder.
- Mm.

05:17.502 --> 05:20.374
I carry knowledge beyond
my years and experience.

05:20.407 --> 05:21.710
<i>Aho.</i>

05:24.014 --> 05:26.987
<i>Aho!</i>
...in the back, there, aunties.

05:27.020 --> 05:28.691
Keep it together.

05:28.724 --> 05:30.595
He's not single.

05:30.628 --> 05:33.601
We've got some great sessions
planned today...

05:33.634 --> 05:35.505
Uh, also, you got to stay till
the end to get your gift card.

05:35.538 --> 05:36.907
- Thank you so much.

05:36.940 --> 05:38.511
- Oh, man...
- Seriously?

05:38.544 --> 05:42.384
These notebooks are
your new journals.

05:42.417 --> 05:44.690
Give them a Native name.

05:44.723 --> 05:46.594
Decolonize them.

05:54.041 --> 05:56.145
That is beautiful.

05:56.178 --> 05:59.085
To start things off today,

05:59.118 --> 06:02.792
I want everybody to think of
a happy memory in your life.

06:04.529 --> 06:06.065
What if you've never been happy?

06:07.602 --> 06:10.708
Write about how
you've never been happy.

06:10.741 --> 06:12.144
Shit.

06:12.177 --> 06:13.914
White Steve,
you got to write mine.

06:13.947 --> 06:15.417
It can be anything.

06:15.450 --> 06:18.056
A time you went to
your favorite restaurant,

06:18.089 --> 06:20.862
or a time you did something
that you were proud of.

06:20.895 --> 06:23.099
I will give you all
ten minutes

06:23.132 --> 06:25.103
to write it down.

06:33.987 --> 06:35.892
Oh, shit.

06:37.494 --> 06:38.698
You one of us now, man.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.438
<i>Aho,</i> yeah!

06:43.907 --> 06:45.444
<i>
And that</i>

06:45.477 --> 06:47.113
<i>was the happiest day
of my life.</i>

07:03.847 --> 07:07.254
<i>I made the
most beautiful thing I have ever seen.</i>

07:10.795 --> 07:13.634
Painting relaxes me.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.838
Art is a wonderful
creative outlet.

07:15.871 --> 07:17.207
- Thank you for sharing, nephew.

07:17.240 --> 07:18.678
That was, that was beautiful.

07:18.711 --> 07:21.884
All right.
Who else hasn't gone?

07:21.917 --> 07:23.754
What about you?

07:25.925 --> 07:27.929
I didn't know we had
to read 'em out loud.

07:27.962 --> 07:30.702
That's okay.
We're all friends here.

07:30.735 --> 07:32.572
As if. Fawk.

07:32.605 --> 07:34.175
Yeah.

07:34.208 --> 07:36.847
- These are my enemies.
- MISSM8TRI@RCH: No.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.653
That is a colonized
way of thinking, sister.

07:39.686 --> 07:42.224
We never had enemies
amongst our own back in the day.

07:42.257 --> 07:45.130
We could fight, yes, but...

07:45.163 --> 07:48.971
mostly we just made love,
ate berries.

07:49.004 --> 07:50.541
Sometimes the deer would even

07:50.574 --> 07:52.679
eat out of our palms.
It was beautiful.

07:52.712 --> 07:55.851
These are your people.

07:56.987 --> 07:58.489
Go ahead.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.176
"One time, when I was little,

08:08.209 --> 08:09.746
"my brother taught me
how to ride a bike

08:09.779 --> 08:11.315
"in the alley
behind my dad's house.

08:13.219 --> 08:15.290
<i>"We was out there forever</i>

08:15.323 --> 08:16.794
"when I looked up and realized

08:16.827 --> 08:18.964
"the fucker had
let go of the bike.

08:18.997 --> 08:21.537
"I was pissed until I realized

08:21.570 --> 08:23.874
"I was actually riding it
on my own.

08:26.178 --> 08:29.284
"It was scary,
but, like, in a good way.

08:33.292 --> 08:36.566
I knew he was gonna
catch me if I fell."

08:38.837 --> 08:41.342
Or... whatever.

08:41.375 --> 08:43.881
That was beautiful.

08:43.914 --> 08:46.285
There is nothing like
the feeling of being free

08:46.318 --> 08:48.757
and safe at the same time.

08:52.832 --> 08:54.836
Okay, we're gonna have
a little fun here.

08:54.869 --> 08:56.940
It's called the potato dance.

08:56.973 --> 08:59.078
Uh, you guys.

08:59.111 --> 09:01.315
Now, the potato is a symbol

09:01.348 --> 09:03.721
- of trust.
- Fuck.

09:03.754 --> 09:05.591
So when I
start the song, I want

09:05.624 --> 09:08.129
you and your partner
to hold that potato trust

09:08.162 --> 09:10.668
in between your third eyes
to keep it from falling.

09:10.701 --> 09:11.970
Let's do this.

09:14.976 --> 09:17.214
All right.
We doing this or what?

09:17.247 --> 09:19.251
- Fuck it.

09:21.355 --> 09:23.928
Please, bro,
don't fuck this shit up.

09:23.961 --> 09:26.265
It takes two, fucker.

09:31.408 --> 09:33.881
- Stay on beat, come on.

09:33.914 --> 09:35.283
- One, two.
- That's what I'm doing.

09:35.316 --> 09:37.387
- You ever see <i>Squids Games?</i>
- Shh.

09:37.420 --> 09:40.227
- Stop moving.
- I'm dancing.

09:40.260 --> 09:41.964
- You have to dance.

09:41.997 --> 09:43.801
You smell so good.

09:43.834 --> 09:44.803
Ugh.

09:44.836 --> 09:46.005
- All right, I...
- What?

09:46.038 --> 09:47.675
We could've won that.
Hey. No.

09:47.708 --> 09:48.944
I want that.

10:03.707 --> 10:05.343
Yo, what the fuck are you doing,
man? Stay on beat.

10:05.376 --> 10:06.947
I'm on beat, bitch.

10:06.980 --> 10:08.851
Like, what the fuck
you think we're doing?

10:08.884 --> 10:10.387
- Shut up, shut up, I got to focus.
- What do you mean?

10:10.420 --> 10:11.322
- You're the one that fucking...
- Shut up, shut up,

10:11.355 --> 10:12.057
just shut the fuck up.

10:16.031 --> 10:17.835

- Doing good.

10:23.179 --> 10:24.983
All right, let's get
a little lower now.

10:25.016 --> 10:25.985
Go low.

10:26.018 --> 10:27.855
Oh, shit.

10:30.360 --> 10:31.863
Hey...

10:34.067 --> 10:35.805
You're losing rhythm,
White Steve.

10:35.838 --> 10:37.374
What even is rhythm?
I'm trying.

10:37.407 --> 10:38.911
Oh...

10:48.029 --> 10:49.866
BEAR (whispers::
Go low, go low.

10:52.304 --> 10:54.341
- What the fuck?
- Oh, shit.

10:54.374 --> 10:56.780
All right, we got our winners here.
Congratulations.

10:56.813 --> 10:58.349
- Oh, shit.

11:03.359 --> 11:04.829
We would've won.

a flat-ass forehead.

Hey. Everyone here's having
a good time but you.

11:23.499 --> 11:26.038
Hey, Bear.
They gave me an extra fry bread.

11:26.071 --> 11:27.407
Do you want it?

11:27.440 --> 11:29.044
Yeah.

11:30.213 --> 11:31.381
What up?

11:38.162 --> 11:40.367
Brothers. What's good?

11:40.400 --> 11:41.903
Chillin'.

11:41.936 --> 11:44.208
See you growing that topknot.

11:44.241 --> 11:45.745
I'm growing it out a little.

11:45.778 --> 11:46.947
Man.

11:46.980 --> 11:48.951
Well, it makes my spirit happy

11:48.984 --> 11:51.188
seeing that I can
inspire young Natives

11:51.221 --> 11:53.192
such as yourself
to grow their hair.

11:53.225 --> 11:55.363
I just met you today.

11:55.396 --> 11:59.271
What about you? When are you
gonna grow that manhood out?

11:59.304 --> 12:01.141
Can I?

12:03.379 --> 12:05.216
So, where you from?

12:06.452 --> 12:09.391
I'm from the Lakota Oyate
in Pine Ridge.

12:09.424 --> 12:11.028
Oh.

12:11.061 --> 12:12.899
- That's cool.
- Mm-hmm.

12:12.932 --> 12:14.936
My uncle's that.

12:14.969 --> 12:16.807
Well, what's it like there?

12:16.840 --> 12:20.815
Well, actually,
I am from the Bay Area.

12:20.848 --> 12:22.217
Oh.

12:22.250 --> 12:24.355
City Indian. Cool.

12:24.388 --> 12:26.058
That's cool.

12:26.091 --> 12:28.129
That's awesome, actually.

12:28.162 --> 12:30.200
My body grew up in the Bay Area,

12:30.233 --> 12:32.404
but my spirit lives
with my ancestors.

12:32.437 --> 12:33.339
Oh...

12:34.542 --> 12:36.546
I'm going home soon,
to make a documentary

12:36.579 --> 12:39.051
about the youth that don't have
a fighting chance.

12:39.084 --> 12:40.453
Oh, for real?

12:40.486 --> 12:41.923
MISSM8TRI@RCH:
Mm-hmm.

12:41.956 --> 12:43.159
Bear makes documentaries
all the time.

12:43.192 --> 12:44.294
Oh?

12:44.327 --> 12:46.165
Yeah, we go spray-painting

12:46.198 --> 12:48.871
and we walk around,
make actual art.

12:48.904 --> 12:50.240
- Mm.
- Fight.

12:50.273 --> 12:51.510
Fuckin' go steal shit.

12:51.543 --> 12:53.880
I would love to put that
in my documentary.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.485
Yeah.

12:59.357 --> 13:00.995
You're not eating?

13:01.028 --> 13:02.431
Can't.

13:02.464 --> 13:03.933
Why not?

13:05.904 --> 13:07.841
That bitch knows I work here.

13:10.113 --> 13:12.316
Probably put medicine
on the beans.

13:15.056 --> 13:17.094
For what?

13:17.127 --> 13:18.530
I snagged her man.

13:18.563 --> 13:20.066
And her son.

13:24.207 --> 13:26.445
Not at the same time.

13:26.478 --> 13:28.282
It was, like, days apart.

13:30.153 --> 13:31.957
MISSM8TRI@RCH:
My young ones, you do not

13:31.990 --> 13:34.495
have to go through
hard things in life alone.

13:34.529 --> 13:37.300
Sometimes, when things
seem impossible,

13:37.333 --> 13:40.073
that is when you can rely
on your own people

13:40.106 --> 13:41.442
to keep you on the red road.

13:41.475 --> 13:44.415
Go ahead and start guiding
your partners.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.419
Okay.

13:46.452 --> 13:48.356
- Okay.
- Ready?

13:48.389 --> 13:49.491
- Yeah, you ready?
- Oh.

13:49.525 --> 13:50.561
Okay.

13:50.594 --> 13:52.130
Do... Go forward.

13:52.163 --> 13:53.600
Yeah, like two big steps.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.602
- Yep.
- Big steps.

13:54.635 --> 13:56.005
- Shit.
- Yeah.

13:56.038 --> 13:57.542
- <i>I dig down... ♪</i>
- Right.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.378
Right another step.

13:59.411 --> 14:02.217
Yeah, okay.
Forward, like, two steps.

14:02.250 --> 14:05.591
Okay, and then one step
to your... left.

14:05.624 --> 14:08.664
Going, keep going, keep going,

14:08.697 --> 14:11.235
keep going, keep going...
Uh, stop.

14:11.268 --> 14:13.339
Uh, one step to your left.

14:13.372 --> 14:16.546
Yup. Another one. Little one.

14:16.579 --> 14:17.615
Turn your body left.

14:17.648 --> 14:20.353
Go straight.

14:20.386 --> 14:23.994
Go straight, go straight,
go straight. Stop.

14:24.027 --> 14:26.398
Now reach in your pocket
and grab some change.

14:26.431 --> 14:28.537
What do you need the money for?

14:28.570 --> 14:31.175
Just put it in
and start pressing buttons.

14:31.208 --> 14:32.945
All right, keep straight.

14:32.978 --> 14:34.081
Yup.

14:34.114 --> 14:35.250
I said, keep straight.

14:35.283 --> 14:36.385
This <i>is</i> straight.

14:36.418 --> 14:38.055
Bro, that's fucking sideways.

14:38.088 --> 14:39.993
Why do you have
to say it like that?

14:40.026 --> 14:42.665
Like what?
I'm just saying, move forward.

14:42.698 --> 14:45.203
Okay, forward. You could say it
with a little bit of respect.

14:45.236 --> 14:47.407
Respect? Okay.

14:47.440 --> 14:49.111
Go forward another step
and then right.

14:49.144 --> 14:51.015
Yeah, respect.

14:51.048 --> 14:54.087
Like, you never thought
the shit you do affects people?

14:59.431 --> 15:01.469
Okay. I can respect that.

15:01.503 --> 15:04.007
I just... I hope
that you can respect

15:04.040 --> 15:06.011
that I'm trying, also.

15:06.044 --> 15:08.416
Okay, two steps to your right.

15:08.449 --> 15:11.656
I can because I'm gonna be
the bigger man. Fuck.

15:13.292 --> 15:15.063
Okay, um,

15:15.096 --> 15:17.167
and then two steps
to your right.

15:19.004 --> 15:20.707
Hear that? Grab.

15:22.578 --> 15:24.081
What are you doing?

15:24.114 --> 15:28.690
Okay, now take
five long steps forward.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.205
So, are we good?

15:36.238 --> 15:39.244
I don't know yet, man.

15:40.614 --> 15:42.752
Yeah, yeah, keep going.

come forward.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.606
- Fuck that.
- No fuckin' way.

16:09.639 --> 16:11.743

16:30.212 --> 16:31.683
like Jesus did for you,

16:31.716 --> 16:34.321
and be ready

16:34.354 --> 16:36.425
Fuck. She's not my sister.

I'm not gonna fuck this up.

What's your fucking problem?

16:59.337 --> 17:00.808
I don't know.
You better go get your brother

17:00.841 --> 17:02.578
to put
those training wheels back on.

17:10.426 --> 17:12.598
Willie Jack, that was fucked up.

17:12.631 --> 17:14.602
What'd I do?

17:14.635 --> 17:16.539
Her brother died.

17:16.572 --> 17:19.344
Yeah, like Daniel.

17:23.385 --> 17:25.590
The fuck, man?
I didn't know that.

17:33.740 --> 17:36.345
I'm so proud of you young ones.

17:36.378 --> 17:40.521
Just being here today is
an act of decolonization.

17:40.554 --> 17:43.560
Um, what-what exactly
do you mean

17:43.593 --> 17:46.231
- when you say "decolonization"?
- Well,

17:46.264 --> 17:48.369
decolonization is
the undoing of colonialism.

17:48.402 --> 17:50.774
Well, I-I know the definition,

17:50.807 --> 17:53.379
um, but I was asking, uh,

17:53.412 --> 17:55.818
how are the things we did today

17:55.851 --> 17:58.656
supposed to do anything?

18:00.527 --> 18:03.533
Well, uh, I like to think...

18:03.566 --> 18:07.374
- Allow me to speak for you, sister.
- Mm-hmm.

18:07.407 --> 18:11.215
We here as
Indigenous people are braiding together

18:11.248 --> 18:13.720
the hairs of our ancestral ways.

18:13.753 --> 18:16.625
That is decolonization.

18:17.628 --> 18:19.732
Yeah, that doesn't
make any sense.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.872
Yes. Exactly.

18:22.905 --> 18:25.811
- Keep thinking for yourself and asking questions.
- Yup.

18:25.844 --> 18:30.521
I'm so glad that I was able
to give you that gift today.

18:30.554 --> 18:33.626

Shall we close out?

18:45.584 --> 18:47.555
Listen.

18:47.588 --> 18:50.561
- Youth of this space.

18:50.594 --> 18:53.232
Yes, the space here,

18:53.265 --> 18:58.242
but also the space
with the suns and the stars.

18:58.275 --> 19:00.346
This land is your land.

19:00.379 --> 19:02.417
This land is their land,

19:02.450 --> 19:04.421
our ancestor's land.

19:04.454 --> 19:06.425
- Powerful.
- Mm-hmm.

19:06.458 --> 19:09.565
We are not dead.
We are still here.

19:09.598 --> 19:11.569
Not like our ancestors.

19:11.602 --> 19:15.577
But some
of their dreams were made.

We... are still... here.

21:31.448 --> 21:34.020

That was fucked up.

21:34.053 --> 21:36.926
What was fucked up?

21:36.959 --> 21:39.599
Willie Jack... dropping her

21:39.632 --> 21:41.101
and talking shit
on her dead brother.

21:44.541 --> 21:46.411

21:46.444 --> 21:47.982
Willie Jack didn't even know.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.419
And you're just automatically
taking Jackie's side?

21:50.452 --> 21:52.423
What are you talking about,
"side"?

21:52.456 --> 21:55.597
No, I... It's all fucked up.

21:55.630 --> 21:58.102
Come on. You can't fault
Willie Jack for being loyal.

21:58.135 --> 22:00.039
Not like you know anything
about that.

22:00.072 --> 22:01.943
- - I mean, to
be honest, I don't even know

22:01.976 --> 22:03.713
why you came here today.

22:03.746 --> 22:05.651
All you've done is just
showed up and act like

22:05.684 --> 22:07.588
everybody's supposed
to get along. And I mean,

22:07.621 --> 22:10.426
come on. You never even
once said, "I'm sorry, Bear,"

22:10.459 --> 22:12.430
or, "I fucked up," or, "Thanks
for fucking being there."

22:12.463 --> 22:14.100
I mean, all you've done

22:14.133 --> 22:16.539
is shit on your friends and
expect us to show up for you.

22:16.572 --> 22:18.543
Honestly, you're gonna end up
exactly like your grandma--

22:18.576 --> 22:20.614
alone until it's too late.

22:24.722 --> 22:26.859

22:32.470 --> 22:34.875
you're just living
in some kid fucking drama.

22:34.908 --> 22:38.717
Maybe you can't see
how sorry I am

22:38.750 --> 22:41.956
because you can't
fucking see outside of yourself.

22:41.989 --> 22:44.494
I'm sorry I hurt you.

22:44.528 --> 22:47.166
I am. But fucking
hearing all this,
