WEBVTT

00:15.208 --> 00:17.416
-Whoa!

00:19.500 --> 00:21.250
Ah!

00:26.958 --> 00:28.458
-Ah! No!
-Huh?

00:30.583 --> 00:31.416
Ah!

00:32.541 --> 00:33.458
Ouch!

00:46.125 --> 00:47.916
-Hey!

01:18.583 --> 01:20.500
Hello, everyone! Thank you!

01:20.583 --> 01:21.875
She hasn't aged a bit!

01:21.958 --> 01:24.125
Oh, come on.
Back off and let me cut this thing.

01:33.666 --> 01:36.625
Come on!
He said he would be five minutes.

01:37.250 --> 01:38.625
Ugh. Finally.

01:38.708 --> 01:39.708
Huh?

01:43.166 --> 01:45.125
I'm very unpleasant when I'm hungry.

01:45.208 --> 01:47.416
You're unpleasant all the time.

01:49.583 --> 01:52.666
That's my secret, Barney.
I'm always hungry.

01:52.750 --> 01:55.333
No, those are supplies for the line.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.083
Speaking of line, let's go!

01:59.500 --> 02:01.708
What's so special about this ride anyway?

02:01.791 --> 02:03.875
Haven't you been on all of them already?

02:03.958 --> 02:06.791
Not this one.
It's been closed since before I was born.

02:06.875 --> 02:08.416
-It's based on <i>Dr. Love.</i>

02:08.500 --> 02:10.375
The show where Pauline
would solve people's love lives

02:10.458 --> 02:11.958
with heart transplants.

02:12.041 --> 02:13.875
It was canceled after three episodes.

02:13.958 --> 02:17.000
Ooh. They are kind of scratching
the bottom of the barrel

02:17.083 --> 02:18.375
for ride ideas, aren't they?

02:18.458 --> 02:21.500
Hey! Dr. Love did
some pretty experimental episodes.

02:21.583 --> 02:24.375
Like that one set
entirely in a waiting room.

02:24.458 --> 02:26.250
Oof. That sounds boring.

02:26.333 --> 02:29.625
Besides, this is my only opportunity
to ride it before my shift starts,

02:29.708 --> 02:32.166
and my timeline
gets flooded with spoilers.

02:32.250 --> 02:35.916
<i>Your appointment</i>
<i>with Dr. Love will begin momentarily.</i>

02:36.000 --> 02:39.166
<i>Please keep all hands,</i>
<i>bags and babies inside the ride vehicle.</i>

02:39.250 --> 02:41.541
Not too bad.

02:41.625 --> 02:43.166
Looks like we're just on time.

02:44.208 --> 02:46.416
Uh… Yeah, I'm… I'm good.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.583
Have fun.

02:47.666 --> 02:49.625
What? You're just gonna leave me here?

02:49.708 --> 02:52.333
There are two spaces per boat.
We can't be an odd number.

02:52.416 --> 02:54.291
Who knows who I'll end up with?

02:54.375 --> 02:55.958
-Hungry.

02:56.041 --> 02:58.416
-The three of you could fit in one boat.
-Hmm.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.625
I haven't got time for this today.

03:07.458 --> 03:09.750
Uh, changed my mind! Uh, let's go!

03:14.875 --> 03:17.041
-If I don't eat anything…

03:17.125 --> 03:18.791
…in the next minute…

03:18.875 --> 03:22.750
I know, you'll eat me.
Can I at least finish this chapter?

03:25.208 --> 03:26.166
Thanks, Barney.

03:26.250 --> 03:29.208
For a minute there I thought
I'd have to share with this weirdo.

03:29.291 --> 03:30.166
Barney?

03:31.458 --> 03:33.458
Hey, I thought it was you.

03:35.708 --> 03:37.166
-Barney?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.708
Ha! Nice beard.

03:42.458 --> 03:44.125
Wah!

03:44.208 --> 03:45.708
Phew. Thanks.

03:49.291 --> 03:50.833
-Ooh.

03:53.416 --> 03:57.916
No!

03:58.000 --> 04:00.750
So, are you guys in line
for Dr. Love's Heart Flow

04:00.833 --> 04:03.208
Are you in line for Dr. Love's Heart Flow?

04:03.291 --> 04:06.583
Am I? I've wanted
to ride this thing for years!

04:06.666 --> 04:08.500
I heard it's disgusting.

04:08.583 --> 04:11.416
You ride on a river of blood
into a huge throbbing heart and--

04:11.500 --> 04:12.958
Spoilers.

04:13.958 --> 04:16.666
You know, you guys can go
in the employee fast lane.

04:16.750 --> 04:19.041
Just duck under the rails
and show your pass at the front.

04:20.166 --> 04:21.208
Huh?

04:22.333 --> 04:23.250
Okay.

04:24.416 --> 04:26.541
So long, suckers!

04:28.625 --> 04:32.250
What? I thought
this line was for employees!

04:32.333 --> 04:35.583
Employees <i>and</i> family members.

04:36.833 --> 04:39.250
Huh. What?

04:40.333 --> 04:41.916
Typical.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.666
I gotta use this line.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.833
I've been given
a very important task today.

04:45.916 --> 04:48.416
I've gotta see
if the wait time sign is accurate.

04:48.500 --> 04:51.041
-Oh, well, you're busy, so--
-I'd love some company.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.833
Uh… Mm-hmm.

04:57.791 --> 05:00.916
So… Blood, huh?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.208
It's kind of gross.

05:02.291 --> 05:06.541
But, uh, pssh, I wouldn't want to…
not have any?

05:06.625 --> 05:08.166
That's true.

05:08.250 --> 05:10.500
-Oh, babe.

05:10.583 --> 05:13.166
Marly, remember
our conversation about eavesdropping.

05:13.250 --> 05:14.708
Hide it better.

05:14.791 --> 05:19.083
Sorry. But it's just so wonderful
seeing a new generation enjoy this ride.

05:19.166 --> 05:21.125
We came here on our first date.

05:21.208 --> 05:22.833
How long have you boys been together?

05:22.916 --> 05:23.750
Oh!

05:23.833 --> 05:26.000
Uh, no, we're, uh… We're, uh…

05:26.083 --> 05:27.458
Colleagues.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.083
-Right.
-Of course.

05:32.208 --> 05:35.333
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

05:35.416 --> 05:38.708
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

05:38.791 --> 05:40.166
Are we there yet?

05:40.250 --> 05:42.208
-Are we there--

05:45.833 --> 05:47.625
-Are we there--
-Quiet!

05:48.250 --> 05:51.541
At this rate,
Barney's gonna get there first for sure.

05:51.625 --> 05:55.666
-Um, Norma? Help!

06:00.625 --> 06:04.500
I said you could have a little bit,
not a whole Pugsley.

06:06.916 --> 06:08.125
Ugh.

06:08.208 --> 06:12.083
Courtney, stop trying to eat Pugsley.
Pugsley, stop offering to be eaten.

06:12.166 --> 06:16.083
-We'll get lunch after.
-But I want it now!

06:23.166 --> 06:25.458
Hmm.

06:25.541 --> 06:27.375
Ask him about himself.

06:28.500 --> 06:31.750
Uh, so, uh, do you, uh…

06:31.833 --> 06:34.541
Like blood, then?

06:34.625 --> 06:36.500
Again with the blood?

06:36.583 --> 06:38.916
You trying to work out if I'm a vampire?

06:39.000 --> 06:42.416
Wait, are you?
Oh, that would be so typical.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.750
What?

06:46.291 --> 06:48.250
Railings.

06:49.541 --> 06:50.916
Am I right?

06:51.000 --> 06:54.500
Well, as health and safety officer,
I care quite a bit about railings.

06:54.583 --> 06:58.083
They're amazing!
I love these railings!

06:58.166 --> 07:00.541
These aren't actually
up to code, to be honest.

07:00.625 --> 07:02.958
I did request the triple-bolted kind.

07:03.041 --> 07:04.666
Ah. Oh, these railings?

07:04.750 --> 07:06.666
I meant to say I hate them. I…

07:06.750 --> 07:08.750
I hate these railings.

07:08.833 --> 07:10.875
Excuse me. Sorry.
Coming through. I left my bag.

07:10.958 --> 07:12.791
-Sorry! Excuse me.

07:12.875 --> 07:15.958
I left my bag on the ride. I left my bag.
Excuse me, excuse me.

07:18.291 --> 07:20.125
Come here, you little hot dog!

07:20.208 --> 07:21.375
-Get back!
-No!

07:21.458 --> 07:22.666
-Just a little nibble!

07:22.750 --> 07:24.541
-No, no, no!

07:24.625 --> 07:26.083
Oh, Barney's texted me.

07:26.166 --> 07:27.875
"Help. I can't do this on my own."

07:28.666 --> 07:31.750
-He's not on his own, he's with Logs.
-That's what he's worried about.

07:31.833 --> 07:34.375
They're in a public space,
and Logs is known to Barney.

07:34.458 --> 07:36.833
-The risk level seems low to me.

07:36.916 --> 07:40.041
"Ah! I'm freaking out."
And then there's like 20 emojis.

07:40.125 --> 07:42.458
Scared face, scream vomit face,
a cat with horns and…

07:42.541 --> 07:44.375
-A little white flag?

07:46.250 --> 07:47.625
"Just be yourself."

07:47.708 --> 07:49.833
-That's what the movies say.

07:49.916 --> 07:51.416
"I don't want to be myself."

07:51.500 --> 07:53.625
Psst! Hey, guys!

07:53.708 --> 07:54.958
-Psst!
-Barney!

07:55.708 --> 07:57.833
All on track.

07:57.916 --> 07:58.750
Oh!

07:58.833 --> 08:01.208
I could get some
line satisfaction feedback while I'm here.

08:01.708 --> 08:04.958
Guys, help. I'm so bad at this.

08:05.041 --> 08:07.416
I'm the socially awkward one.
Stop stealing my thing.

08:07.500 --> 08:10.333
This is different. I really like Logs.

08:10.416 --> 08:12.708
Like, like like-like him.

08:13.416 --> 08:14.875
Oh, I can't do this!

08:14.958 --> 08:17.208
Pugsley, there's gotta be something
in that book to help.

08:17.291 --> 08:19.791
Uh, maybe a confidence booster charm.

08:19.875 --> 08:24.625
Or… or a spell that fills
my brain with jokes or something.

08:26.416 --> 08:27.541
Is this a good idea?

08:27.625 --> 08:30.000
Last time Pugsley used magic
he summoned a witch.

08:30.083 --> 08:32.333
-Technically, she was a hag.
-Ah.

08:32.416 --> 08:35.291
Yeah. Ooh, something like that. Good idea.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.708
You said you didn't want to be yourself?

08:38.791 --> 08:41.708
Well, this is the spell for you.

08:41.791 --> 08:42.833
That looks bad.

08:48.041 --> 08:50.500
Pugs? You okay?

08:50.583 --> 08:54.833
So that's two "leave me alone"s
and one threat of violence.

08:54.916 --> 08:57.750
-Great, thanks for the feedback!
-Get lost!

08:57.833 --> 08:59.208
Are you okay?

09:00.625 --> 09:03.291
Excuse me,
I have to get to the front.

09:03.375 --> 09:04.875
I left my baby on the ride.

09:04.958 --> 09:06.500
-I left my baby.

09:06.583 --> 09:08.583
You smell amazing!

09:08.666 --> 09:12.583
-Thanks. My secret is soap! Huh?

09:14.916 --> 09:16.791
Wow. I'm tall.

09:19.541 --> 09:22.208
Aah.

09:25.333 --> 09:29.041
Are you hungry?
Uh, we could get some food after the ride.

09:29.125 --> 09:33.000
Sure. What kind do you like?
Wet food, dry food, human food?

09:33.083 --> 09:36.291
Uh, we could go for burgers.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.500
What is he doing?

09:45.583 --> 09:49.125
Oh, nothing weird.
He's just possessed Barney, that's all.

09:49.208 --> 09:50.208
What?

09:51.458 --> 09:53.708
But then, where's Barney?

09:55.708 --> 09:57.083
Hello?

09:59.208 --> 10:01.166
Where did everybody go?

10:04.666 --> 10:06.208
Ah, yeah.

10:06.958 --> 10:09.041
-Okay, that's it.
-To the left a bit.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.291
-I want to go.
-I don't think Barney would like that.

10:11.375 --> 10:15.500
-He trusts Pugsley, and--
-You guys don't trust me?

10:15.583 --> 10:16.458
No.

10:16.541 --> 10:18.500
Oh, yeah. Fair enough.
Of course you shouldn't trust me.

10:18.583 --> 10:22.000
But I've watched a ton of documentaries
about human courting rituals

10:22.083 --> 10:23.916
so I know I can handle this.

10:29.041 --> 10:30.125
Huh?

10:34.583 --> 10:36.500
Are you okay? Do you need help?

10:36.583 --> 10:38.250
Hey, what's with the questions, pal?

10:38.333 --> 10:40.125
Who died and made you lord of the line?

10:40.208 --> 10:42.583
Sorry. I guess.

10:52.291 --> 10:55.833
Wow, look at all these attractive people.

10:55.916 --> 10:58.833
You must feel pretty lucky
that I chose to stand with you

10:58.916 --> 11:02.083
amid this sea of variously clothed humans.

11:02.166 --> 11:03.833
You can stand
with someone else if you want.

11:03.916 --> 11:05.625
Maybe I will.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.458
That bag seems like a good food vessel.

11:10.541 --> 11:12.958
-May I take a look?
-Uh…

11:20.750 --> 11:24.708
Huh? Yo, Pugsley! Uh, where are we?

11:34.291 --> 11:35.833
What is she doing?

11:35.916 --> 11:36.958
Either she found some food,

11:37.041 --> 11:39.416
or Logs is getting
a lot more than he bargained for.

11:41.166 --> 11:43.583
I won't let her ruin this for Barney.

11:43.666 --> 11:46.833
Norma, fetch.
Wow, that feels weird to say.

11:46.916 --> 11:49.666
Wait, why? Uh-oh.

11:55.791 --> 11:57.916
Oh, no.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.041
What is happening here?

12:00.125 --> 12:03.208
-Well, at least I'm further ahead.
-What?

12:03.291 --> 12:05.708
Ugh. Right. Let's just get through this.

12:05.791 --> 12:08.333
Small talk. Do you have any siblings?

12:08.416 --> 12:10.333
What do you like to do outside
of work and school hours?

12:10.416 --> 12:13.750
Do you follow any sports teams?
Is there a genre of music that you prefer?

12:13.833 --> 12:16.416
In my day, we just asked
what people's signs were.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.750
Oh.

12:17.833 --> 12:20.166
Capricorn. I actually
just got my charts done.

12:20.250 --> 12:22.500
Uh… Please answer my questions in order.

12:22.583 --> 12:25.208
I'm creating intimacy.
For example, I have one sibling.

12:25.291 --> 12:27.541
A brother, Patrick.
It was actually his birthday last week--

12:27.625 --> 12:30.500
Wait, the kid who had the party?
Why didn't you say anything?

12:30.583 --> 12:34.083
Oh! Right. Yeah, uh, a family tradition.

12:34.166 --> 12:36.125
We don't acknowledge
each other's birthdays.

12:36.208 --> 12:38.291
Far too schmaltzy. Your turn.

12:38.375 --> 12:40.458
-Uh, I have a sister.
-Me, too.

12:41.250 --> 12:43.125
Wait, you just said
you only had a brother.

12:43.791 --> 12:47.083
Right. I… Uh, Barney, was testing you.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.625
-Excellent powers of observation, Logs.
-Oh!

12:52.625 --> 12:53.958
Kids these days.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.375
Sure are strangely literal.

12:56.458 --> 12:58.916
I was making progress, Norma!

12:59.000 --> 13:01.416
Logs thought Barney basically hated him,

13:01.500 --> 13:03.375
which is exactly what humans are like

13:03.458 --> 13:07.666
according to <i>Fakin' and Negs:</i>
<i>A Pathetic Man's Guide to Dating.</i>

13:07.750 --> 13:09.791
Can't we all just stop possessing
one another?

13:10.791 --> 13:16.291
Or maybe we should possess
each other even more.

13:16.375 --> 13:17.875
Uh, why?

13:17.958 --> 13:19.541
Uh, for laughs?

13:19.625 --> 13:22.083
Eh, let's try my idea first.

13:24.000 --> 13:24.875
Ha ha!

13:30.541 --> 13:32.541
Ugh! This is not my baby! Ugh.

13:32.625 --> 13:35.166
This is not my baby.
I need to return it to the front!

13:39.208 --> 13:41.625
Norma? Norma!

13:41.708 --> 13:42.541
Barney!

13:42.625 --> 13:46.625
Oh, thank God you're here.
I… I think we're dead.

13:46.708 --> 13:50.791
So, actually I'm really sorry
that you're here.

13:50.875 --> 13:53.333
We're not dead.
We're just not in our bodies.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.416
That sounds dead.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.375
No, it's just that
Courtney is possessing me.

13:57.458 --> 13:59.708
That's terrible!

13:59.791 --> 14:01.875
To be fair, I was possessing you.

14:01.958 --> 14:03.166
Why?

14:03.250 --> 14:05.000
I needed to smooth things over with Logs

14:05.083 --> 14:07.083
after whatever Courtney
and Pugsley said to him.

14:07.166 --> 14:10.000
-You mean you all possessed me?

14:10.083 --> 14:12.166
Well, you… Huh?

14:14.291 --> 14:15.666
Pauline?

14:15.750 --> 14:16.916
Pauline!

14:18.083 --> 14:20.416
Pauline!

14:20.500 --> 14:23.416
Wait. You're not Pauline.

14:24.041 --> 14:25.625
It was on a night like tonight.

14:26.458 --> 14:29.375
<i>One of the park's Pauline impersonators</i>
<i>entered Dead End.</i>

14:33.958 --> 14:36.208
You're Jennifer Swan!

14:39.708 --> 14:43.791
You mean, the girl
who disappeared from Dead End?

14:43.875 --> 14:46.166
Ah, maybe we are dead.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.375
We have to get her out of here.

14:48.458 --> 14:52.125
I… I can't believe I had the chance
to say goodbye to my parents

14:52.208 --> 14:56.000
and I just ran away instead.

14:56.083 --> 14:58.291
Jennifer!

14:58.375 --> 15:00.041
Where have you been, Jennifer?

15:00.125 --> 15:02.083
Have you been in here this whole year?

15:02.166 --> 15:04.625
Everyone is looking for you.
Do you need help?

15:04.708 --> 15:08.333
Did you want a photo, puddin'?
I think the booth is this way.

15:08.416 --> 15:11.416
No. We're gonna
get you out of here, Jennifer.

15:12.666 --> 15:15.041
I've never seen myself
from this angle.

15:15.125 --> 15:17.208
It's a real privilege.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.208
-So, you're Courtney?
-Yes.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.833
-In Norma's body?
-Yes.

15:23.916 --> 15:25.500
But where's Norma?

15:25.583 --> 15:27.500
She'll be fine.

15:28.125 --> 15:31.041
But then who is in Barney?

15:35.333 --> 15:36.750
Whoa!

15:37.875 --> 15:40.083
Yeah…

15:40.166 --> 15:43.541
Do you have a flowchart, maybe?
I'm really more of a visual learner.

15:43.625 --> 15:47.166
-Are you worried about Barney?
-Always.

15:47.250 --> 15:50.541
Why don't you check
on him, then? And, fetch!

15:50.625 --> 15:53.416
See, it does sound better
coming from someone else.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.833
Hey. You went kind of silent
for a while there.

16:00.916 --> 16:02.791
Felt like you were miles away.

16:04.458 --> 16:05.541
Huh?

16:05.625 --> 16:08.458
Norma? Norma?

16:09.208 --> 16:10.958
Did you want a photo, puddin'?

16:11.041 --> 16:14.666
Courtney, you have to send me back!
I found her! I found Jennifer!

16:14.750 --> 16:16.083
And what is that place?

16:16.166 --> 16:18.416
-That's just the In-between.
-The what?

16:18.500 --> 16:22.750
When you're possessed,
your soul goes there for the time being.

16:22.833 --> 16:27.500
You're not dead, you're not alive,
you're just sort of, uh, backstage.

16:27.583 --> 16:28.708
It's harmless.

16:28.791 --> 16:31.875
Although,
if you're there too long,

16:31.958 --> 16:33.125
you know, you can't come back.

16:33.208 --> 16:34.375
What?

16:34.458 --> 16:37.166
Ah! We only have seven minutes left.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.375
How long have you been here?

16:41.458 --> 16:43.375
Don't… Don't you have friends?

16:43.458 --> 16:46.000
Or family? Don't they miss you?

16:46.083 --> 16:48.291
Did you want a photo, puddin'?

16:48.375 --> 16:54.416
Must be lonely,
being trapped in this, uh, endless loop.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.541
Hello, puddin'.
Would you like an autograph?

16:57.625 --> 17:01.833
I'm sorry, Logs.
You must be having an awful time.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.541
I mean seriously,
I mean, toilet water?

17:06.625 --> 17:09.750
Why does it taste better
than regular?

17:09.833 --> 17:13.416
Getting excited, boys?
It's really quite a ride.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.500
Sure is. Though you do need
to keep your hands inside the boat

17:16.583 --> 17:18.791
or the boat will keep your hands.

17:24.166 --> 17:27.541
You know, I just realized
this ride will be the first time

17:27.625 --> 17:30.166
we've ever been totally alone.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.583
Kind of weird, right?

17:31.666 --> 17:33.208
Uh, yeah, very weird.

17:35.666 --> 17:39.291
Hey, why don't we go walkies instead?
I mean, for a walkies. A walk.

17:39.375 --> 17:42.375
Yeah. After the ride, let's do just that.

17:46.625 --> 17:48.875
Hey, do you nice people
want to jump in the line?

17:48.958 --> 17:50.166
Get in before us?

17:50.250 --> 17:53.208
Oh, we wouldn't dream of it.

17:53.291 --> 17:56.208
Why are humans so perfect?

18:00.041 --> 18:04.333
This is immoral! I won't steal
his special boy time from him. Here!

18:04.416 --> 18:08.000
These human emotions
are getting way too deep for me.

18:08.083 --> 18:09.333
I can't deal with them.

18:09.416 --> 18:11.208
You think I can?

18:14.208 --> 18:15.875
You take it. Hmm.

18:15.958 --> 18:19.708
Can someone please possess me already?
I need to get back into the In-between.

18:19.791 --> 18:23.375
Look, I don't think
this is a good idea. I shouldn't have…

18:23.458 --> 18:25.750
Oh.

18:26.958 --> 18:28.333
It's not a scary ride.

18:28.416 --> 18:31.416
I can hold your hand
the entire time if you want.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.583
-We're nearly there.
-Huh?

18:33.666 --> 18:34.791
Ew! No thank you.

18:34.875 --> 18:38.666
Oh, come on, let's get smoochy!

18:40.875 --> 18:42.041
-Huh?

18:45.208 --> 18:46.541
Logs!

18:46.625 --> 18:48.541
-Barney?

18:49.708 --> 18:52.250
Uh. What just happened?

18:52.333 --> 18:53.625
Uh, you lost your balance.

18:53.708 --> 18:56.291
Possibly a result
of your large upper body.

18:57.625 --> 19:00.583
We know you're nervous,
kid, but we got you.

19:00.666 --> 19:02.583
If we'd let our nerves get in the way…

19:02.666 --> 19:04.791
Who knows where we'd be now.

19:05.875 --> 19:08.166
-We need to get Barney back right now.

19:08.250 --> 19:10.083
I came back when you left my body.

19:10.166 --> 19:12.958
-Why didn't he?
-I don't know. Maybe he doesn't want to.

19:13.041 --> 19:15.125
Barney's run away
from his problems before.

19:15.208 --> 19:16.875
Norma, you need to bring him back.

19:24.375 --> 19:27.541
Oh, my gosh! I'm adorable.

19:29.666 --> 19:31.083
Barney!

19:31.166 --> 19:32.708
You need to get out of here.

19:32.791 --> 19:35.208
I know talking
to people you like is stressful.

19:35.291 --> 19:38.125
Like, believe me.
I still struggle talking to you sometimes.

19:39.041 --> 19:44.041
Oh, it's not that. I was using
the Logs date thing to distract me.

19:44.125 --> 19:48.791
To run away again,
and now I've run away to here.

19:49.791 --> 19:53.125
I need to stop. I can't keep running away.

19:53.208 --> 19:56.208
Running away from what?
Is there a demon after you?

19:56.291 --> 19:59.625
Worse. My family.

19:59.708 --> 20:01.291
We'll deal with that later.

20:01.375 --> 20:02.958
Courtney says
if you stay here for too long

20:03.041 --> 20:04.750
you might never be able to come back.

20:04.833 --> 20:06.208
Never?

20:06.291 --> 20:08.833
-Uh, but what about her?
-Oh, hello, puddin'.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.000
-Would you like an autograph?
-We can't leave her here.

20:11.083 --> 20:14.208
Jennifer! Please come with us.

20:14.291 --> 20:16.208
Oh, hi, puddin'. Would you like an--

20:16.291 --> 20:18.291
No! We don't need an autograph.

20:18.375 --> 20:20.083
We want you to come with us, Jennifer.

20:20.166 --> 20:22.041
There are people
in the real world who love us

20:22.125 --> 20:24.375
and we can't hide from them forever.

20:24.458 --> 20:26.541
Jennifer, you have to tell us
what happened to you.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.708
Who were you before you came to the park?

20:28.791 --> 20:30.250
Think about her.

20:31.583 --> 20:32.458
Please, Jennifer.

20:44.208 --> 20:46.708
Uh, I have to return that, you know.

20:46.791 --> 20:48.625
It's 10,000 years overdue.

20:48.708 --> 20:49.958
Guys, come on.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.916
Let's all relax and hope that <i>Barney</i>

20:52.000 --> 20:54.291
is having a good time on <i>Barney's</i> date

20:54.375 --> 20:59.541
and maybe someone could scratch <i>my</i> head
because I have been a very good boy today.

21:03.666 --> 21:06.458
Huh. Looks like
we've got two minutes to spare.

21:06.541 --> 21:08.000
I guess the sign was wrong.

21:08.083 --> 21:09.708
-Next.
-Out of the way, please!

21:09.791 --> 21:12.416
Out of the way!
I simply must ride the ride again.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.041
I do not like waiting.

21:16.291 --> 21:19.333
Well, at least she was honest this time.

21:20.125 --> 21:22.166
Hey, I'm really sorry

21:22.250 --> 21:25.833
if I seemed weird
while we've been waiting.

21:25.916 --> 21:30.583
Sometimes I get really nervous
and want to run away from everything

21:30.666 --> 21:36.166
or pretend to be someone else,
but I gotta stop. I'm sorry.

21:36.916 --> 21:38.625
You don't need to say sorry to me.

21:38.708 --> 21:40.958
I'm nervous, too,
but we'll have each other.

21:41.041 --> 21:41.875
Next.

21:44.958 --> 21:47.250
So, are you ready for this?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.125
Yup.

21:50.791 --> 21:52.000
Another time.

21:52.083 --> 21:53.291
Sorry.

21:53.375 --> 21:55.958
I'll make sure
to tell the boss how precise you were

21:56.041 --> 21:57.375
with the time checking, though.

21:57.458 --> 21:59.833
I think it's cool
how much you love your job.

21:59.916 --> 22:01.083
Bye!

22:02.500 --> 22:06.458
Ah! I thought the employee line
was supposed to be faster.

22:06.541 --> 22:07.875
I guess it's you and me, then.

22:07.958 --> 22:10.916
I'm going to have to narrate this ride.
You'll find it very educational.

22:12.500 --> 22:14.500
<i>Doctor Love--</i>

22:15.750 --> 22:16.833
Oh, come on!

22:18.125 --> 22:19.083
Wait! Mom!

22:21.333 --> 22:24.708
Um. Uh, how have you been?

22:31.875 --> 22:34.708
How long was I out?
