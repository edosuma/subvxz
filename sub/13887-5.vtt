00:44.920 --> 00:49.835
Well, that's finished the test.
We just have to wait for the results.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.152
I had to allow
for you cheating at your eye tests.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.880
- What?
- There's no point in lying, sir.

00:57.040 --> 01:02.114
Last night, knowing you had a medical,
you copied the eye charts onto your shoes.

01:02.320 --> 01:07.075
I admit I took a peek,
but I'm a competitive man. Always have been.

01:07.240 --> 01:12.234
- That's what makes me what I am.
- We're all aware of what you are, sir.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.431
Oh, the results.

01:16.960 --> 01:19.110
Everything ticketyboo?

01:19.280 --> 01:21.874
Take a seat for a moment, sir.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.874
- Problem?
- You don't have any next of kin, do you?

01:26.040 --> 01:28.395
No, they all died of heart attacks.

01:28.560 --> 01:32.439
Not just heart attacks -
aneurysms, strokes, you name it.

01:32.640 --> 01:38.272
Are you the type that, faced with bad news,
prefers to hear that news unvarnished

01:38.440 --> 01:42.991
or to live in blissful ignorance
of the nightmare you're facing?

01:44.200 --> 01:46.555
Ignorance every time.

01:46.720 --> 01:50.998
Congratulations, sir! You've come storming
through your medical with flying colours.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.233
- See you next time.
- Everything's OK, then?

01:54.440 --> 01:56.590
Absolutely peachy.

01:56.880 --> 02:01.271
- I want to know if something's wrong.
- If there was, I would tell you.

02:01.440 --> 02:04.716
- Even if I'd asked you not to?
- Well, no.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.713
Then I would lie
and say everything was peachy.

02:08.600 --> 02:12.673
Kryten, I want to know. Is there bad news?

02:12.880 --> 02:15.348
Lie mode cancel.
Yes, sir. I'm afraid there is.

02:15.520 --> 02:20.196
I knew it. It's the headaches, isn't it?
And the palpitations, the blackouts,

02:20.360 --> 02:23.318
the chest pains and the voices, isn't it?

02:23.520 --> 02:26.080
Sir, you were recreated as a hologram.

02:26.240 --> 02:30.916
Your exact personality was refined to
an algorithm and duplicated electronically.

02:31.080 --> 02:34.390
Any flaw in it would be duplicated also.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.591
- Flaw?
- It's not common,

02:36.760 --> 02:39.035
but it's possible for a hologram to die.

02:39.840 --> 02:45.631
Kryten, get to the point before I make
your nose the filling of a buttock sandwich.

02:46.520 --> 02:52.117
As a result of both genetics and environment,
you are prone to stress-related disorders,

02:52.280 --> 02:57.798
and your activities over the past few years
have pushed your brain beyond breaking point.

03:00.920 --> 03:04.117
Your T-count, the hologrammatic
equivalent of blood pressure,

03:04.280 --> 03:08.068
is higher than a hippy at an open-air festival.

03:09.240 --> 03:12.471
If you wish to avoid
a gigantic electronic aneurysm,

03:12.640 --> 03:15.438
you must start on a program of relaxation.

03:15.640 --> 03:21.749
I see. And you thought the best way to start
was to tell me my brain's about to explode.

03:21.920 --> 03:25.037
You've got the bedside manner
of an abattoir gutter.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.875
Here's what I suggest.
Try and avoid all stressful situations.

03:30.040 --> 03:35.160
Spend more time in your hard light form
and exercise. And here...

03:36.040 --> 03:39.828
Use these Chinese worry balls
whenever you feel tense.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.478
Hey, maybe some good news. Check it out.

03:45.680 --> 03:51.232
Kryten, I don't want the others to know
about this. Behave as if everything's normal.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.630
As you wish, sir.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.588
- There she blows.
- Logging onto the ident computer.

04:03.760 --> 04:07.639
- What's this?
- The simulant ship we totalled a while back.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.916
We're gonna board it for supplies.

04:10.080 --> 04:14.676
Is that wise, sir? The scan says
the superstructure could go at any time.

04:14.840 --> 04:18.116
- What if some simulants survived?
- There's an old Cat saying,

04:18.279 --> 04:20.271
"If you eat tuna, expect bones."

04:20.480 --> 04:25.600
There's an old human saying,
"If you talk garbage, expect pain."

04:25.800 --> 04:28.872
- We'll take our chances man, OK?
- No K.

04:29.040 --> 04:32.157
They're cybernetically-deranged
mechanical killing machines.

04:32.320 --> 04:37.872
Not content with destroying their ship,
you now want to steal their belongings?

04:38.080 --> 04:41.550
That's like flopping your wedding tackle
into a lion's mouth

04:41.720 --> 04:45.599
and flicking his love spuds with a wet towel.

04:45.760 --> 04:49.992
- Total insanity.
- Since that refrigeration unit packed in,

04:50.160 --> 04:55.678
we've had to live off a few handfuls of moss
and fungi scraped off passing asteroids.

04:55.840 --> 05:01.073
- I can't stand it any more.
- You'd rather have a psychopathic killer

05:01.240 --> 05:04.277
play your frontal lobes like a xylophone

05:04.440 --> 05:08.035
than have another bowl
of nourishing space nettle soup?

05:08.800 --> 05:12.873
Buddy, I'd hand him the sticks
and hold up the sheet music.

05:13.040 --> 05:17.113
Lister, they are simulants.
Why should they have food supplies?

05:17.320 --> 05:21.996
Because the ident computer
says they do. Look...

05:22.160 --> 05:24.754
- Stocked to the gills.
- It's true, sir.

05:24.920 --> 05:30.199
Simulants carry large stocks of food in order
to prolong the torment of their victims.

05:30.360 --> 05:35.309
They've kept subjects alive
for 40 years in a state of perpetual agony.

05:35.480 --> 05:40.634
If we wanted to live in perpetual agony,
we'd let Lister play his guitar.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.031
- We don't. I say drive on.
- Kryten, what's for dinner?

05:44.200 --> 05:47.954
Tonight, sir, asteroidal lichen stew
followed by dandelion sorbet.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.951
We're going in.

05:55.320 --> 05:58.756
Sir, can't you see
your behaviour is totally irrational?

05:58.920 --> 06:03.198
We can remove him from duty
as per Space Corps Directive 196156.

06:03.400 --> 06:08.349
196156? "Any officer caught sniffing
the saddle of the exercise bicycle

06:08.520 --> 06:11.956
"in the women's gym
will be discharged without trial"?

06:12.120 --> 06:16.636
Hmm. That doesn't quite get
to the nub of the matter for me.

06:16.800 --> 06:22.238
Sir, we have enough weeds and fungus
for you to scrum yourself stupid forever.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.595
This foolhardy trip beggars logic.

06:24.760 --> 06:28.275
Lister, listen to him. When is he ever wrong?

06:28.440 --> 06:32.797
He may have a head shaped
like an inexplicably popular fishing float,

06:32.960 --> 06:37.511
but he operates with total logic,
and we'd be fools to ignore him.

06:37.720 --> 06:44.592
At least let me and Mr Rimmer go instead.
We are electronic life-forms and expendable.

06:44.760 --> 06:48.799
What the smeg
would you know, bog-bot from hell?

06:49.000 --> 06:52.515
There's something else.
I didn't want to worry the Cat.

06:52.720 --> 06:58.829
The fuel tank got punctured when we hit
that moon. We're out of power in days.

06:59.040 --> 07:02.794
- What about the readouts?
- I rigged the readouts.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.951
You rigged the readouts?!

07:05.120 --> 07:08.157
I can't breathe!
I'm hyperventilating!

07:08.320 --> 07:12.791
- Please, sir, don't panic.
- It's not panic, it's a hysterical fit!

07:13.000 --> 07:16.310
Grind those balls, sir! Grind them!

07:17.200 --> 07:22.194
Let me get this straight. If we board
that ship and get captured, we're finished.

07:22.360 --> 07:26.990
However, if we don't get captured, but the
superstructure disintegrates, we're finished.

07:27.200 --> 07:31.955
On the other hand, if we don't get captured
and the superstructure doesn't disintegrate

07:32.120 --> 07:34.759
but we can't find any fuel, we're finished.

07:34.960 --> 07:38.396
- That's about it.
- After you with the balls, sir.

07:39.040 --> 07:44.398
We're out of options. We've got less choice
than a Welsh fish and chip shop.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.273
We've got to board that ship.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.671
Just pray the crew are rotting in Silicon Hell.

07:50.880 --> 07:54.316
- You three go. I'm not leaving Starbug.
- Fine.

07:54.520 --> 07:57.717
Unless of course something weird
and hideously ironic happens,

07:57.880 --> 08:04.399
like you get boarded by a rampaging party
of crazed simulants gripped by bloodlust.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.551
I'll go and pack.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.188
Bring your brown rubber safety pants.

08:10.360 --> 08:16.276
And your hard light remote belt.
We need all the hands we can muster.

08:22.160 --> 08:26.438
- Life signs.
- Those suckers'll be lunching on laser.

08:26.600 --> 08:32.072
Last time we met I was wearing
the same outfit. No one's telling that story.

08:32.240 --> 08:35.869
I suppose now's as good a time as any
to tell you.

08:36.039 --> 08:39.395
- Tell us what?
- We can't actually use the bazookoids.

08:39.559 --> 08:42.120
They're for psychological reasons only.

08:42.280 --> 08:47.229
The superstructure is so unstable that
even a loud noise could start a shipquake.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.755
That's why I skipped chillies for breakfast.

08:51.480 --> 08:54.119
- Don't look at me like that?
- Like what?

08:54.280 --> 08:58.956
- Like a nostril hair in a Spanish omelette.
- Why didn't you tell us?

08:59.120 --> 09:02.317
- Didn't want you to panic.
- Didn't want us to p...?!

09:05.360 --> 09:09.399
Let me get this clear.
If we meet any deranged killing machines,

09:09.560 --> 09:11.551
we have to combat them silently?

09:11.720 --> 09:16.874
How? Whisper "Charge", tippytoe up to them
and chloroform them with Lister's armpits?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.877
Priceless.

09:31.560 --> 09:34.552
- A teleporter.
- Hmm. Fully functional.

09:34.760 --> 09:38.548
- Let's grab what we gotta and load up.
- Quietly.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.679
It's not gonna hold much longer.

09:57.880 --> 10:01.953
One more trip, Kryten. One more crate
of red-hot West Indian pepper sauce.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.632
Shh!

10:06.920 --> 10:11.391
Well, if it isn't my old friends,
the human vermin,

10:12.360 --> 10:18.708
the scabrous slime, the pus-sucking,
puke-laden cesspits of unspeakableness.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.317
She remembers us.

10:22.200 --> 10:29.709
Annihilated my ship, slaughtered my fellow
simulants and you practically destroyed me.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.394
Yes, I remember you.

10:32.600 --> 10:38.550
One thing - last time we met, I wore a black
number with peach trim and gold spangles.

10:38.720 --> 10:44.556
And although this looks like the same outfit,
it's an entirely different black number

10:44.720 --> 10:48.395
with completely different gold spangles.

10:48.600 --> 10:52.673
That was an important speech, sir,
but I suggest that from now on,

10:52.840 --> 10:57.550
this discourse is conducted
by those with brains larger than a grape.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.711
Take it away, bud.

10:59.880 --> 11:04.032
OK, let's visit Ronnie Real.
This is a classic stalemate situation.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.879
You can't use weapons. Neither can we.

11:07.040 --> 11:11.318
Let's chalk this down to experience,
and we'll be on our way.

11:11.480 --> 11:16.270
Actually, as far as psychotic killer
simulants go, you're a bit of a babe.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.711
- What are you doing tonight?
- Dying.

11:23.840 --> 11:28.709
- Care to join me?
- Hey, come on. Let's just talk, OK?

11:28.920 --> 11:33.277
We didn't start any of this,
and I think that maybe NOW...

11:33.480 --> 11:35.869
is a good time to parley.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.918
Let's not hang around. Get on with it.

11:39.120 --> 11:43.671
There is nothing to discuss.
In 60 seconds, you'll be dead.

11:43.880 --> 11:46.758
- You can't be serious.
- I'm totally serious.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.315
I don't believe you're being serious.

11:49.520 --> 11:54.230
I do not understand why you're having
such problems grasping this concept.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.995
I'm a totally ruthless, amoral killing machine,

11:58.200 --> 12:03.399
so why, in the name of all that's putrid,
don't you believe I'm serious?

12:03.600 --> 12:07.593
I'll say this once more.
You can still change your mind.

12:07.760 --> 12:11.992
Think about all we've been through.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

12:15.640 --> 12:17.710
Cheers, Rimmer! He's started a shipquake!

12:17.880 --> 12:20.599
- The superstructure's disintegrating!
- The teleporter!

12:22.520 --> 12:26.354
I must warn you, the teleporter's
not calibrated for human tissue.

12:26.520 --> 12:29.910
There's a 20% chance
you'll be turned inside out.

12:30.080 --> 12:35.518
Let me check my lining.
Innards and lavender, I can carry that off.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.956
- What's this?
- This is a week last Thursday.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.475
I must have made a programming error.

12:44.680 --> 12:49.390
Kryten! You can't burst in on an earlier
versión of yourself without warning!

12:49.600 --> 12:52.751
You've made everything
totally surreal now. I'm very cross!

12:52.960 --> 12:56.157
Pardon my paradox,
but the simulant ship you encounter...

12:56.320 --> 12:58.595
We don't want to know!

12:58.760 --> 13:02.196
Don't compound your temporal faux pas
by disclosing our future.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.755
Where's the rangy, handsome one?

13:04.960 --> 13:10.512
You? You scarpered in that escape pod,
you slimy, triple-faced, back-stabbing Judas.

13:10.720 --> 13:13.837
Ah! I'm safe, then? Thank God for that.

13:14.040 --> 13:18.397
Don't talk to them!
Get back to your own damn time line!

13:18.600 --> 13:20.955
- Here we go.
- Be you later.

13:23.040 --> 13:25.759
Let's get out! It's gonna blow!

13:41.640 --> 13:44.518
All in all, 100% successful trip.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.671
But, sir, we lost Mr Rimmer.

13:46.840 --> 13:50.150
All in all, 100% successful trip.

13:50.320 --> 13:54.711
- I can't believe he did that.
- Sir, I didn't tell you before,

13:54.880 --> 13:59.476
but I discovered that Mr Rimmer is suffering
from a stress-related nervous disorder.

13:59.640 --> 14:03.792
When I see him he'll be suffering
from a fist-related teeth disorder.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.116
- Incoming message.
- <i>My escape plan worked, then?</i>

14:11.320 --> 14:16.189
- What escape plan?
- <i>Setting off the disintegration of the ship</i>

14:16.360 --> 14:21.559
<i>by bravely leaping into the escape pod,</i>
<i>creating a diversión, so you could...</i>

14:21.720 --> 14:24.598
- <i>Actually, how did you escape?</i>
- The teleporter.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.916
<i>That wasn't the only way.</i>

14:27.080 --> 14:32.632
<i>I'm sure no one's forgetting the manliness</i>
<i>of the diversionary part of the plan,</i>

14:32.800 --> 14:36.076
<i>and to hasten the recovery</i>
<i>of the modest hero.</i>

14:36.280 --> 14:39.317
- Actually, Flash, that might be a problem.
- <i>What?</i>

14:39.520 --> 14:42.114
You're accelerating way above our top speed.

14:42.320 --> 14:48.953
I've logged into your ident computer.
Simulants looted the pod from a seeding ship.

14:49.120 --> 14:54.478
There are no controls. It is programmed to
find the nearest planet with an atmosphere.

14:54.640 --> 14:57.552
- <i>How long to get me back?</i>
- Well, let's see.

14:57.720 --> 15:01.713
Checking the local area. No, nothing there.

15:01.880 --> 15:05.953
Going to mid-range... Er, still nothing.

15:06.120 --> 15:08.236
Going to long-range...

15:08.400 --> 15:10.197
Long-long-range...

15:10.360 --> 15:15.229
Long-long-long-range.
Ah, here we have it, just computing.

15:15.680 --> 15:20.276
- <i>Well? How long?</i>
- Have you still got those worry balls, sir?

15:20.440 --> 15:23.989
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Well, start grinding like never before.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.668
- <i>How long?</i>
- Let me tell him, Kryten.

15:26.880 --> 15:30.316
- <i>How long?</i>
- A year and a half.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.909
<i>That's ridiculousl Get me back.</i>

15:33.120 --> 15:36.351
We could bring you down
with a laser cannon, sir.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.472
Form an orderly queue behind the gun sight.

15:39.680 --> 15:42.831
- <i>Another way!</i>
- Sir, there are no other options.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.151
Wait. Something's happening. Course change.

15:46.360 --> 15:49.909
Check. Your guidance system's
found a nearer S3 planet.

15:50.080 --> 15:53.470
It's taking you through
that wormhole at 495372.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.989
You should make planetfall in four days.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.998
<i>Isn't there a time-dilation problem</i>
<i>with wormholes?</i>

15:59.200 --> 16:02.272
Well, yes. Since you're travelling
through a compressed space,

16:02.440 --> 16:05.557
time moves more swiftly
passing though the wormhole.

16:05.720 --> 16:08.837
One minute this side
represents years on the other.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.031
<i>So, is that good?</i>

16:11.200 --> 16:13.191
Balls on standby, sir.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.394
- <i>More than a year and a half?</i>
- Yes.

16:17.600 --> 16:21.479
- <i>How much more?</i>
- Let's not beat around a bush - a lot.

16:21.640 --> 16:26.998
- <i>That's still beating about the bush.</i>
- Remember that medieval war, sir?

16:27.880 --> 16:31.111
- <i>The Thirty Years' War?</i>
- No, the other one.

16:31.280 --> 16:35.273
- <i>The Hundred Years' War?!</i>
- Take that figure, multiply it by six,

16:35.440 --> 16:37.908
then you get your golden number, sir.

16:38.120 --> 16:41.271
- <i>Six hundred years?!</i>
- Pinch me!

16:43.120 --> 16:45.111
We're losing contact, any minute.

16:45.320 --> 16:48.630
Six hundred years with myself
as company? I'll go mad!

16:48.840 --> 16:52.469
There's an old Cat saying...
but you don't want to hear it.

16:53.280 --> 16:58.308
On the upside,
the pod's stocked with solar accelerators.

16:58.520 --> 17:01.512
That'll keep your hard light drive going.

17:01.760 --> 17:06.231
As the pod came from a seeding ship,
it may have terraforming equipment,

17:06.400 --> 17:08.470
possibly with a genetic capability.

17:08.680 --> 17:12.036
<i>I'll never survive.</i>
<i>I'm not the Robinson Crusoe type.</i>

17:12.200 --> 17:15.431
<i>I'm lousy at woodwork,</i>
<i>no good in the wild.</i>

17:15.599 --> 17:19.434
<i>At school, it took me five terms</i>
<i>to make a tent peg.</i>

17:19.599 --> 17:25.232
<i>How long will it take to build a two-storey</i>
<i>home with running water and a patio?</i>

17:25.400 --> 17:28.198
<i>Six hundred years? I'll still be planing!</i>

17:28.400 --> 17:31.551
Losing contact any second.
See you in eight lifetimes.

17:31.760 --> 17:36.629
One last word, sir - remember your condition.
Try and avoid stressful situations.

17:36.800 --> 17:40.998
Whatever befalls you,
greet it with a smile and a song.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.950
<i>You are a total, total,</i>
<i>complete, utter, total...</i>

17:51.200 --> 17:53.509
- He's gone.
- What do we do now?

17:53.720 --> 17:57.952
Nothing we can do,
I know for a fact there's no champagne.

17:58.560 --> 18:03.031
To us, Mr Rimmer will be gone
for just a few hours,

18:03.240 --> 18:07.756
but Mr Rimmer will have to wait
six centuries for us.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.799
To hell with the champagne,
we can celebrate with urine resyc.

18:16.320 --> 18:20.552
<i>This is the personal log</i>
<i>of Space Corps hologram Arnold J Rimmer.</i>

18:21.360 --> 18:27.037
<i>Day 1. After landing, I ventured forth to</i>
<i>explore the place I would be calling home</i>

18:27.200 --> 18:30.078
<i>for the next two thirds of a millennium.</i>

18:30.240 --> 18:36.156
<i>A desert planet, the only life-forms the most</i>
<i>basic single-celled protozoa and me.</i>

18:36.320 --> 18:39.756
<i>Relationships would be difficult,</i>
<i>but not impossible.</i>

18:40.600 --> 18:44.195
<i>I repaired to the pod</i>
<i>to appraise the supply situation.</i>

18:44.360 --> 18:47.955
<i>The pod had indeed been looted</i>
<i>from a seeding ship.</i>

18:48.120 --> 18:53.990
<i>Among the supplies, I found two strange</i>
<i>devices labelled "eco-accelerator rockets".</i>

18:54.600 --> 18:59.913
<i>I held out little hope that they might</i>
<i>improve my lot, but launched them anyway.</i>

19:00.760 --> 19:03.877
<i>For six days,</i>
<i>the planet was wracked with storms,</i>

19:04.040 --> 19:07.396
<i>the like of which</i>
<i>I had never witnessed before.</i>

19:07.560 --> 19:10.233
<i>Then, just as suddenly, they stopped.</i>

19:10.400 --> 19:14.916
<i>In just six days, I had created</i>
<i>my own worid, lush and verdant.</i>

19:15.120 --> 19:17.395
<i>I had created Rimmerworid.</i>

19:17.680 --> 19:23.516
<i>I was Adam in my own Eden,</i>
<i>and only one thing was missing</i> - <i>my own Jane.</i>

19:23.720 --> 19:27.793
<i>As I studied the pod's textbooks,</i>
<i>my excitement grew.</i>

19:27.960 --> 19:31.748
<i>It seemed entirely possible</i>
<i>to create a fully grown female clone</i>

19:31.920 --> 19:34.559
<i>using my own DNA as a template.</i>

19:34.760 --> 19:37.991
<i>This, of course,</i>
<i>created the most enormous moral dilemma.</i>

19:38.160 --> 19:42.153
<i>Technically, she would be my sister,</i>
<i>unable to be a lover.</i>

19:42.920 --> 19:46.469
<i>After much soul searching,</i>
<i>I reluctantly decided.</i>

19:46.640 --> 19:49.712
<i>What the hell? I just wouldn't tell her.</i>

19:49.880 --> 19:55.238
<i>After months of careful nurture,</i>
<i>the cocoon cracked.</i>

19:57.880 --> 19:59.996
<i>Something had gone hideously wrong.</i>

20:01.360 --> 20:07.595
<i>The clone was just an identical copy of me.</i>
<i>I went back to the manuals and tried again.</i>

20:13.680 --> 20:16.069
There she blows, an S3 planet.

20:16.240 --> 20:19.789
Navicomp locked. Entering atmosphere.

20:21.800 --> 20:26.271
Got something.
Try quadrant four-niner-seven-two.

20:26.440 --> 20:30.228
- Scan says there's life signs.
- Confirmed. Thousands of them.

20:30.400 --> 20:36.032
Either Mr Rimmer had the incredible good
fortune to land on a populated planet, or...

20:36.200 --> 20:39.158
- Or what?
- It's too hideous to contemplate.

20:39.720 --> 20:41.711
Preparing to land.

20:42.920 --> 20:45.229
- Wait. Nasal alert!
- You're getting something?

20:45.400 --> 20:51.350
I sure am. My nasal hairs are quivering like
an opera singer's bosom on the high notes.

20:51.560 --> 20:53.278
- Halt, abomination!
- Rimmer?

20:53.480 --> 20:55.471
- Silence, travesty.
- Rimmer?

20:56.320 --> 21:00.791
Never have I seen such a hideously formed
or unnaturally freakish deviant.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.956
Rimmer?!

21:04.680 --> 21:09.959
Silence, mutant! How dare you stand there
and address a norm using that face!

21:10.120 --> 21:12.350
It's a revolting insult against nature.

21:12.520 --> 21:17.958
This might sound a bit corny, but...
I can't bring myself to say it.

21:18.600 --> 21:19.919
Say what?

21:21.240 --> 21:25.028
- Take us to your leader.
- Sir, how could you?

21:25.240 --> 21:27.515
Let the Great One judge them.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.668
Who disturbs our royal snooze?

21:39.880 --> 21:45.159
- Rimmer? It's us.
- Dear lord, what created such foulness?

21:45.320 --> 21:49.438
Is this the product
of a marriage 'twixt woman and gerbil?

21:49.720 --> 21:54.111
600 years ago? We were shipmates.
We've come to save you.

21:54.280 --> 21:58.592
We found them in the woods,
Your Flared-Nostrilness

21:58.760 --> 22:01.513
and brought them
to be tried as travesties.

22:01.680 --> 22:04.353
That ain't goalpost-head.
He doesn't smell right.

22:04.520 --> 22:07.159
Agreed, he scans as organic, not hologram.

22:07.320 --> 22:11.438
The "H" is an affectation,
possibly a symbol of power.

22:11.640 --> 22:15.076
These deformed monsters
are no sight for my concubines.

22:15.280 --> 22:18.113
My treasures of pulchritude, run along.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.633
Avert your eyes from her great beauty.

22:33.960 --> 22:38.988
Let the trial begin
before my jacuzzi water grows tepid.

22:41.200 --> 22:44.909
These abominations stand charged
on eight counts of gross deviancy.

22:45.120 --> 22:48.476
Not content with looking abnormal,
they flaunt freakish behaviour

22:48.640 --> 22:52.189
such as charm, bravery,
compassión and... honour.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.994
Are there no signs of normalcy?

22:55.160 --> 22:59.233
No cowardice or pomposity?
No snideyness or smarm?

22:59.400 --> 23:04.269
Not even basic honest-to-goodness
double-dealing two-facedness?

23:04.480 --> 23:08.029
They didn't even attempt
to sell each other out for freedom.

23:08.200 --> 23:11.158
They lack even the most basic natural drives.

23:11.360 --> 23:17.310
- How do you plead?
- We wish to speak to the hologram Rimmer.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.994
I am he!

23:20.200 --> 23:24.557
Not so. We seek your creator,
the father of your people,

23:24.760 --> 23:27.911
the first true Rimmer,
the template for your species.

23:28.120 --> 23:33.240
Enough of this heresy. At the stroke of dawn,
take them out and kill them.

23:33.400 --> 23:39.748
And when you've killed them, burn the bodies,
then bring me the cold ashes on a plate...

23:39.920 --> 23:42.832
with a glass of chilled Sancerre.

23:43.040 --> 23:47.352
This guy's an animal. Doesn't he know
it's red wine with cold ashes?

24:05.080 --> 24:07.548
- Rimmer?
- Smell checks out.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.109
That truly is toilet-brush hair himself.

24:10.760 --> 24:12.910
Of course! I remember.

24:13.080 --> 24:15.833
Custer! Derek Custer!

24:16.000 --> 24:18.070
Kit!

24:18.280 --> 24:20.191
Titan!

24:20.400 --> 24:25.952
- What's happened?
- How long have you been in this pit?

24:27.360 --> 24:29.351
Speed count mode...

24:29.520 --> 24:31.431
557 years?!

24:31.640 --> 24:35.519
- You've been stuck here all this time?
- What happened?

24:35.720 --> 24:38.917
Can you imagine a society
composed entirely of me?

24:40.000 --> 24:44.994
I'm trying not to. Last time I did that,
it took me a week to dry the mattress.

24:46.440 --> 24:52.356
Thousands upon thousands of back-stabbing,
treacherous, hypocritical, cowardly Judases.

24:52.520 --> 24:57.389
They overthrew me. When they found out
they couldn't damage my hard light drive,

24:57.560 --> 25:01.109
they locked me away
to protect their insane lust for power.

25:01.320 --> 25:06.758
Look, I can understand that, but what
have they got against me, Derek and Titan?

25:07.840 --> 25:13.551
Anyone who deviates from the template
is reviled. They're banished from society.

25:13.720 --> 25:19.192
Anyone who displays behaviour deemed
un-Rimmerlike is punished by death.

25:19.400 --> 25:22.710
Is that why no one is brave,
sexy, noble or charming?

25:23.640 --> 25:28.760
- All crimes here.
- I must be public enemy number 1, 2 and 3.

25:28.960 --> 25:34.592
Don't they realise societies can only evolve
through mutations in the gene pool.

25:34.760 --> 25:39.754
Without richness or variety, congenital
disorders and lunacy are commonplace.

25:39.920 --> 25:44.596
Who can forget the insane European monarchies
of the 19th and 20th centuries?

25:44.800 --> 25:49.271
- Oh, what have I created?
- Your very own personal hell.

25:49.480 --> 25:53.439
Fun though it's been hearing
about your 500 years of misery,

25:53.600 --> 25:55.591
shouldn't we make skedaddle plans?

25:55.760 --> 26:01.232
I can't bear the prospect of being burned alive.
Flames and peach? I'd rather die!

26:03.120 --> 26:08.478
- Have you tried escaping, Rimmer?
- It's a planet of back-stabbing slimeballs.

26:08.640 --> 26:11.598
I'd be sold back immediately.

26:11.760 --> 26:18.199
There's got to be a way out. There's not
a prison built that can hold Derek Custer.

26:18.360 --> 26:22.399
Why don't we scrape away this mortar,
slide a brick out,

26:22.600 --> 26:27.515
then using rope weaved from strands
of hessian, rig up a pulley system,

26:27.680 --> 26:33.357
the guard hits a trip wire, gets laid out,
we put Rimmer in the guard's uniform,

26:33.520 --> 26:36.796
we steal some swords, and fight our way out?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.673
Or we could use the teleporter.

26:43.200 --> 26:46.909
Or, at a pinch, we could use the teleporter.

26:50.840 --> 26:54.071
I've done it again! Two anomalies in one day.

26:54.240 --> 26:56.754
I must have accessed
the previous calibration.

26:56.960 --> 27:02.717
- Sorry, we're escaping from Rimmerworid...
- Don't tell them the future.

27:02.920 --> 27:08.438
Rimmer doesn't want to know he gets
persecuted for six centuries by his clones.

27:08.640 --> 27:15.352
Careful, bud. You almost let slip that
he spends the next 557 years in a dungeon.

27:15.560 --> 27:17.869
- Rimmerworid?
- I'm saying nothing, man.

27:18.040 --> 27:21.430
- Can't spoil the surprise.
- Rimmerworid was weeks ago.

27:21.600 --> 27:25.718
We're more concerned about the hideous thing
that's happened to Lister.

27:26.360 --> 27:29.511
- Yeah, where are you?
- Yeah, where am I? I wanna know!

27:33.560 --> 27:36.950
<i># It's cold outside,</i>
<i>there's no kind of atmosphere</i>

27:37.120 --> 27:40.396
<i># I'm all alone, more or less</i>

27:40.560 --> 27:43.711
<i># Let me fly far away from here</i>

27:43.880 --> 27:46.519
<i># Fun, fun, fun</i>

27:46.680 --> 27:50.355
<i># In the sun, sun, sun</i>

27:50.520 --> 27:53.830
<i># I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose</i>

27:54.000 --> 27:57.072
<i># Drinking fresh mango juice</i>

27:57.240 --> 28:00.471
<i># Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes</i>

28:00.640 --> 28:03.393
<i># Fun, fun, fun</i>

28:03.560 --> 28:07.109
<i># In the sun, sun, sun</i>

28:07.280 --> 28:09.919
<i># Fun, fun, fun</i>

28:10.080 --> 28:14.039
<i># In the sun, sun, sun #</i>
