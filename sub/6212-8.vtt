WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:02.469
Okay, thanks for coming...

00:02.469 --> 00:05.973
...and thanks even more
for going.

00:05.973 --> 00:08.242
Finally, the riff-raff
has left the building.

00:08.242 --> 00:09.710
And the moon Io
is comprised mainly

00:09.710 --> 00:11.912
of ice crystals
and sulfur dioxide.

00:11.912 --> 00:13.247
Wow, I've never met
anyone who knows

00:13.247 --> 00:14.715
so much about Jupiter.

00:14.715 --> 00:15.949
It's like
you've been there.

00:15.949 --> 00:19.019
Three summers in a row.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.053
Yoo-hoo!

00:20.053 --> 00:22.155
The sign says coffeehouse,
not boardinghouse.

00:22.155 --> 00:23.757
Let's pack it up, big guy.

00:23.757 --> 00:24.625
Excuse my aunt.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.193
She didn't get
the subtlety chromosome.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.327
That's okay. I've got
to get going anyway.

00:27.327 --> 00:29.596
But how about we finish up
this tutoring session

00:29.596 --> 00:30.731
over pasta
Saturday night?

00:30.731 --> 00:31.832
Oh, I'd love to.

00:31.832 --> 00:34.301
I can explain the difference
between apogee and linguini.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.403
Something tells me one
of those isn't a noodle.

00:36.403 --> 00:38.105
Okay, junior, bust a move.

00:38.105 --> 00:39.606
Sabrina, grab a mop
and start cleaning up.

00:39.606 --> 00:41.375
I'm trying
to make a midnight movie.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.110
See you
Saturday.

00:43.110 --> 00:44.711
Named after Saturn.

00:49.416 --> 00:50.484
Quick question:

00:50.484 --> 00:52.085
are you deliberately
trying to ruin
my dating life?

00:52.085 --> 00:53.587
First of all, he asked you out

00:53.587 --> 00:55.789
and secondly, I don't have
to try to ruin dates.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.824
I have a natural gift for it.

00:57.824 --> 01:00.127
Oh, well, we're all special
in our own way.

01:00.127 --> 01:01.628
I have ten minutes
to get to <i>Rocky Horror</i>

01:01.628 --> 01:03.830
and I still have to change
into my costume.

01:03.830 --> 01:05.432
Wait,
I love <i>Rocky Horror.</i>

01:05.432 --> 01:06.767
Can I come with you?

01:06.767 --> 01:10.203
Uh, if you can clean up
this whole place
in 30 seconds.

01:10.203 --> 01:11.438
Way more time than I need.

01:14.708 --> 01:18.078
Sabrina, I forgot
to get your number,
and I wanted...

01:18.078 --> 01:19.947
Whoa, what happened?

01:19.947 --> 01:21.848
Two seconds ago
this place was a mess.

01:21.848 --> 01:25.519
Oh, well, I am
a whiz with a mop.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.720
Yeah, uh,
I was a little nervous

01:26.720 --> 01:27.854
asking you out
in the first place

01:27.854 --> 01:29.656
because you're smarter
than me.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.625
I got a hunch
you're better at everything...

01:31.625 --> 01:34.094
Let's just forget
about Saturday.

01:36.863 --> 01:39.333
Talk about low self-esteem.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.101
Who does he
remind me of?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.936
Oh, yeah... me.

01:42.936 --> 01:43.904
He was cute, too.

01:43.904 --> 01:46.039
Why did I have to do magic
and scare him off?

01:46.039 --> 01:48.609
I guess I inherited
that date-killer gene, too.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.645
On the upside,
it's the same gene
that lets us do this.

01:54.781 --> 01:55.949
Freaky.

02:02.623 --> 02:09.162
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

02:09.162 --> 02:15.369
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

02:15.369 --> 02:18.672
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

02:18.672 --> 02:22.109
♪ I wanna make it last... ♪

02:25.078 --> 02:28.315
♪ 'Cause I'm out on my own now ♪

02:28.315 --> 02:32.552
♪ And I like the way it feels. ♪

02:40.527 --> 02:43.430
Umm, oh, my tooth!

02:43.430 --> 02:45.198
Silence, wench!

02:45.198 --> 02:47.234
I'm trying to read Liz Smith.

02:47.234 --> 02:50.804
Apparently the Material Girl
really digs that kabala.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.572
I appreciate your concern.

02:52.572 --> 02:54.374
Well, I'd give you the name
of my dentist

02:54.374 --> 02:56.943
but you'd have to get neutered
at the same time.

02:56.943 --> 02:59.079
Thanks, but I have
an appointment with Dr. Axelrod

02:59.079 --> 03:00.080
in the other realm.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.581
Could you pick up
some whitening solution

03:01.581 --> 03:03.016
for my incisors?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.051
I have a better idea.

03:04.051 --> 03:06.253
Why don't you cut back
on the double espresso?

03:06.253 --> 03:08.588
Please!
I quit smoking.

03:08.588 --> 03:10.824
This is all I have left.

03:12.325 --> 03:14.861
Morning.
How was <i>Rocky Horror?</i>

03:14.861 --> 03:17.864
I got rice in my hair
and toast in my bustier.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.433
Huge success.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.501
But I don't think Sabrina
enjoyed herself.

03:21.501 --> 03:23.704
Didn't get any food
in her nightie?

03:23.704 --> 03:26.039
She was obsessing
over this mortal guy.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.074
You know the story:

03:27.074 --> 03:28.942
Boy meets girl,
girl uses magic

03:28.942 --> 03:30.210
boy dumps girl.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.345
Girl goes to <i>Rocky Horror</i>
with aunt.

03:32.345 --> 03:34.414
Aunt sits on melted
Raisinettes.

03:34.414 --> 03:35.816
Aunt changes seats.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.551
Aunt sits on guy
in garter belts...

03:37.551 --> 03:39.252
Hello.

03:39.252 --> 03:41.188
Back to Sabrina?

03:41.188 --> 03:44.524
I just wish she could find
a nice witch to go out with.

03:44.524 --> 03:46.359
It's so tricky dating mortals.

03:46.359 --> 03:47.260
Mortals?

03:47.260 --> 03:49.863
It's tricky dating
anything with a pulse.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.565
Plants, I'm good with.

03:55.502 --> 03:58.739
Ah... how are things
in the mortal realm?

03:58.739 --> 04:00.674
Ahh... ahh...

04:00.674 --> 04:01.575
You know,
my son, Derek

04:01.575 --> 04:03.777
goes to school
in the mortal realm.

04:03.777 --> 04:06.780
Boston College...
he's on a hockey scholarship.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.682
( <i>moaning</i> )

04:08.682 --> 04:12.018
Why he had to go to school in
the mortal realm is beyond me.

04:12.018 --> 04:13.653
He could've gone
to school here

04:13.653 --> 04:15.522
found himself a nice witch
and settled down.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.491
( <i>screaming</i> )

04:17.491 --> 04:18.925
Good-looking kid, huh?

04:18.925 --> 04:19.826
Ahh...

04:22.729 --> 04:24.030
I really appreciate you
guys letting me come home

04:24.030 --> 04:25.966
and take a
few leftovers.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.000
You left the baking soda.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.535
Was that intentional?

04:28.535 --> 04:29.870
I'm back.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.272
Salem, here's your
whitening solution.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.842
Oh, and the dentist
happened to throw in
some mouthwash.

04:35.842 --> 04:40.213
How helpful
for my h-halitosis!

04:40.213 --> 04:42.716
Sabrina, I see you're doing
your weekly shopping.

04:42.716 --> 04:43.717
Yeah, and now all I need

04:43.717 --> 04:45.752
is a cute guy to help me
carry this to the car.

04:45.752 --> 04:47.154
Well, you're in luck.

04:47.154 --> 04:49.089
Dr. Axelrod happened to mention

04:49.089 --> 04:51.558
that he has a terrific,
good-looking son

04:51.558 --> 04:53.627
who's going to school
right here in Boston.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.995
Not interested.

04:54.995 --> 04:58.832
He's smart, athletic,
and best of all,
he's a witch.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.133
Still not interested.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.301
Sabrina, if you
date a witch

05:01.301 --> 05:03.003
you'll have
a lot in common.

05:03.003 --> 05:06.873
I'm guessing there'll
be magic between you two.

05:06.873 --> 05:08.141
Look, it's not the witch part.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.577
It's the fix-up part
that scares me.

05:10.577 --> 05:15.382
Let's hope he's not a homely,
horrendous hooligan.

05:15.382 --> 05:16.283
Oh, hold him down.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.485
I'm going in.

05:18.485 --> 05:19.119
( <i>moaning</i> )

05:24.024 --> 05:26.059
Hey, sorry I'm late.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.495
Morgan and I spent the afternoon
ice-skating.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.930
It was a blast.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.097
So let's recap.

05:31.097 --> 05:33.333
You left early
last night
<i>for</i> a date.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.068
You're coming in late
<i>from</i> a date.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.871
What's next, would you like me
to pay you to go out <i>on</i> a date?

05:37.871 --> 05:39.940
Oh, man, that would be
fantastic.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.107
Work!

05:44.878 --> 05:47.714
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Sabrina Spellman.

05:47.714 --> 05:49.382
You a cop?

05:49.382 --> 05:51.151
Sorry, I'm Sabrina.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.686
I'm Derek Axelrod.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.921
My father's the one keeping
your Aunt Zelda up at night.

05:54.921 --> 05:55.622
Excuse me?

05:55.622 --> 05:57.123
He's doing her root canal.

05:57.123 --> 05:59.759
Oh, so you're
the smart

05:59.759 --> 06:02.095
handsome, athletic
dentist's son.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.331
And you're the
professor's niece
who's perfect for me.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.232
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.833
My aunt can be so pushy.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.602
Actually, my dad's
the one who pushed.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.071
But for once
I'm glad he did.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.672
I have a hard time
meeting cool witches.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.207
Yeah, well, there are no clubs
on campus.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.577
Talk about
your unrepresented minorities.

06:17.577 --> 06:19.613
Hey, who's that guy
talking to Sabrina?

06:19.613 --> 06:20.547
Hilda:
More importantly

06:20.547 --> 06:21.882
does he have
an older brother?

06:21.882 --> 06:23.450
Or a twin?

06:23.450 --> 06:25.252
Aunt Hilda,
this is Derek Axelrod.

06:25.252 --> 06:27.754
Oh, the dentist's son!

06:27.754 --> 06:31.591
Isn't it sweet how
Zelda's rotten molars
brought you two together?

06:31.591 --> 06:32.559
Together?

06:32.559 --> 06:33.560
Oh, and this is Josh.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.462
So, Derek, you go
to school around here?

06:35.462 --> 06:37.864
Yeah, I'm on a hockey
scholarship at BC.

06:37.864 --> 06:39.499
Wow, you must be
really good.

06:39.499 --> 06:42.269
Now, I've heard that
a lot of hockey players

06:42.269 --> 06:43.803
wind up losing
all their teeth

06:43.803 --> 06:46.506
and then they have
to hire someone
to chew their food.

06:46.506 --> 06:47.607
Hilda:
I have an idea.

06:47.607 --> 06:48.775
Why don't you
and I go for a walk

06:48.775 --> 06:51.311
and you can remind me
why I hired you.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.982
So, Derek, can I get you
anything? Coffee, tea...?

06:55.982 --> 06:57.651
How about a date?

06:57.651 --> 06:59.152
Well, it's not on the menu

06:59.152 --> 07:01.488
but lucky for you,
it's on special today.

07:03.189 --> 07:04.557
That must be Derek.

07:04.557 --> 07:05.625
Do you like my pearl earrings?

07:05.625 --> 07:06.693
Very much so.

07:06.693 --> 07:09.796
Do you like my pearly whites?

07:09.796 --> 07:10.897
Oh...

07:10.897 --> 07:11.998
Well,
if I ever get my sight back

07:11.998 --> 07:13.333
I'll let you know.

07:17.504 --> 07:18.705
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:18.705 --> 07:21.908
Oh, flowers...
and sample floss.

07:21.908 --> 07:23.543
My dad wanted
you to have it.

07:23.543 --> 07:26.146
Oh, well, nothing says romance
like unwaxed.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.915
I'll just put these
in some water.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.150
Salem:
Young man!

07:30.150 --> 07:32.352
If I might have a word with you.

07:32.352 --> 07:33.420
I'm not her father

07:33.420 --> 07:34.854
and I don't care how late you
keep her out.

07:34.854 --> 07:37.557
However, table scraps
would be appreciated.

07:37.557 --> 07:38.591
Oh, just ignore Salem.

07:38.591 --> 07:40.126
Everyone else does.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.227
Salem Saberhagen?

07:41.227 --> 07:42.562
The one and only.

07:42.562 --> 07:44.631
Oh, man, it's great
to meet you.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.032
You're a legend
in the other realm.

07:46.032 --> 07:47.100
Really?

07:47.100 --> 07:49.903
I thought your generation
had forgotten me.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.671
Lord knows we try.

07:51.671 --> 07:52.505
Derek:
Hey, the world

07:52.505 --> 07:53.707
would be
a much greater place

07:53.707 --> 07:55.608
if Salem Saberhagen were
in the Emperor's seat.

07:55.608 --> 07:57.077
Tell a friend!

07:57.077 --> 07:57.911
Derek, are you ready
to go?

07:57.911 --> 07:59.079
Yeah, in a second.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.947
My dad always said
you got a bum rap

08:00.947 --> 08:02.215
and he's on
the Witch's Council.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.984
The Witch's Council?

08:03.984 --> 08:05.452
Hey, how about you dump
the broad

08:05.452 --> 08:07.187
and we throw back
a couple of brewskies?

08:07.187 --> 08:08.955
I'm buying.

08:08.955 --> 08:10.957
Oh! If you want to keep
the beautiful smile

08:10.957 --> 08:14.794
I suggest you take your lips
off my date's butt.

08:14.794 --> 08:15.595
Let's go.

08:19.065 --> 08:20.934
And there was the time my aunts
were making a potion

08:20.934 --> 08:23.503
and the mortal I was dating
thought it was soup
and tried some.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.471
We had a hard time
convincing him

08:24.471 --> 08:26.539
that everyone's tongue
occasionally grows hair.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.608
( <i>laughing</i> ):
Been there.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.010
One time, on a date
with a mortal

08:30.010 --> 08:31.711
I let it slip that
my dead ancestors

08:31.711 --> 08:33.680
were coming in for
my family reunion.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.883
Suddenly, the date
was as dead as
my Uncle Murray.

08:36.883 --> 08:39.285
You know, it's so nice not
having to watch what I say.

08:39.285 --> 08:40.353
If I had this conversation
with a mortal

08:40.353 --> 08:42.055
he'd totally freak out.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.323
Not that I have anything
against mortals.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.925
I mean,
my mother's a mortal.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.628
Oh, you're half-mortal?

08:48.628 --> 08:49.996
Yeah, something wrong?

08:49.996 --> 08:52.332
No, I'm just a little surprised.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.834
You seem like
such a total witch.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.536
That's so sweet.

08:59.305 --> 09:01.908
Everything has been going
so great with Derek.

09:01.908 --> 09:03.643
Last week we went hiking
on the moon.

09:03.643 --> 09:06.212
Yesterday we went to the best
seafood place in Atlantis.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.449
Oh, and look what he gave me.

09:09.449 --> 09:11.084
That's a mighty big scallop.

09:11.084 --> 09:11.951
No, it's a hockey puck.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.486
Derek scored
the winning goal with this.

09:13.486 --> 09:14.421
In my day

09:14.421 --> 09:15.255
a gentleman showed
his affection

09:15.255 --> 09:18.291
by bringing you a
vial of frankincense.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.960
I guess the times,
they are a-changing.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.095
Sounds like things
are going pretty well

09:22.095 --> 09:23.163
between you and Derek.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.397
He's taking me home
tonight

09:24.397 --> 09:25.698
to meet his parents
for dinner.

09:25.698 --> 09:26.900
Ooh!

09:26.900 --> 09:28.368
Thanks
for introducing us.

09:28.368 --> 09:29.702
Both:
You're welcome.

09:32.605 --> 09:34.107
Exactly what did
you have to do

09:34.107 --> 09:36.176
with them
getting together?

09:36.176 --> 09:37.710
They met at my coffeehouse.

09:37.710 --> 09:40.213
After I set them up
at my dentist's office.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.215
And why were you
at the dentist?

09:42.215 --> 09:43.416
Because I cracked
my tooth

09:43.416 --> 09:45.151
on one of your
stale biscottis.

09:45.151 --> 09:46.352
I rest my case.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.023
Here it is.

09:50.023 --> 09:50.623
I don't know why

09:50.623 --> 09:51.658
but I'm a little
nervous.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.026
What if your parents
don't like me?

09:53.026 --> 09:54.227
Of course they're
going to like you.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.628
What's not to like?

09:59.365 --> 10:01.935
Gotta like that.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.203
Hey, can I ask you a favor?

10:03.203 --> 10:04.070
Yeah, sure.

10:04.070 --> 10:05.171
Do you mind not mentioning
to my parents

10:05.171 --> 10:06.039
that you're half-mortal?

10:06.039 --> 10:06.806
They're a little funny

10:06.806 --> 10:09.409
about stuff like that.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.678
Hey, it's the kids!

10:11.678 --> 10:12.946
Lauren,
stop cleaning already.

10:12.946 --> 10:13.880
The kids are here.

10:13.880 --> 10:14.948
Tell them
to come on in.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.049
It's freezing
out there.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.283
Oh, good idea.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.986
My liability insurance doesn't
cover frozen girlfriends.

10:19.986 --> 10:20.653
( <i>both parents laugh</i> )

10:23.690 --> 10:26.559
Mmm, brazed dragon...

10:26.559 --> 10:29.762
May I have more bread,
please?

10:29.762 --> 10:31.698
Hey, you're not going to eat
your skin?

10:31.698 --> 10:34.601
Oh, the scales
get stuck in my teeth.

10:34.601 --> 10:37.504
Ah,
sounds like a flosser.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.405
Sabrina, has anyone
ever told you

10:39.405 --> 10:41.141
you have a perfect bite?

10:41.141 --> 10:43.276
No, but I get a lot of
compliments on my bark.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.544
( <i>laughter</i> )

10:44.544 --> 10:46.279
Whoa, she's got a sense
of humor.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.847
Uh-huh, if you're smart

10:47.847 --> 10:49.849
you won't let
this one get away.

10:49.849 --> 10:50.750
Mom...

10:50.750 --> 10:53.686
I heard a great joke today.

10:53.686 --> 10:55.788
These two mortals
walk into a bar...

10:55.788 --> 10:56.689
Dad.

10:56.689 --> 10:58.391
Oh, you're right.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.326
Maybe that one's
a little too racy.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.663
Sabrina, what do you call
a mortal with half a brain?

11:03.663 --> 11:06.299
I, uh... I don't know.

11:06.299 --> 11:07.100
Gifted!

11:07.100 --> 11:10.537
( <i>both parents laugh</i> )

11:10.537 --> 11:12.038
You have a
lovely home here.

11:12.038 --> 11:13.206
Oh, thank you.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.408
We've lived here
for 400 years.

11:15.408 --> 11:15.875
It was a
wonderful

11:15.875 --> 11:16.676
neighborhood until

11:16.676 --> 11:18.211
the mortals started moving in.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.413
Property values
are dropping like flies.

11:20.413 --> 11:23.082
Mortals? Mortals can't live in
the other realm.

11:23.082 --> 11:24.517
Half-mortals,
what's the difference?

11:24.517 --> 11:25.418
It's in their blood.

11:25.418 --> 11:28.054
Who wants
the last aardvark fritter?

11:28.054 --> 11:29.822
Don't get me wrong,
Sabrina.

11:29.822 --> 11:32.192
Some of my best friends
are half-mortals.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.794
I just don't want them
living in my neighborhood.

11:34.794 --> 11:37.263
You hear
what I'm saying?

11:37.263 --> 11:38.731
Loud and clear.

11:49.776 --> 11:50.443
Salem:
Good!

11:50.443 --> 11:51.411
You're home late.

11:51.411 --> 11:54.414
-That means
the date went well.
-Guess again.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.949
Don't tell me
you blew it.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.517
I'm working
on an early parole

11:57.517 --> 11:59.652
and Derek's father's
on the Witches Council.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.287
Well, Derek's father's
also a total bigot.

12:01.287 --> 12:02.422
I had to spend
the entire evening

12:02.422 --> 12:04.290
trying to hide the fact
that I'm half mortal.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.759
That's awful!
I hate prejudice.

12:06.759 --> 12:08.494
Do you know how many women
have rejected me

12:08.494 --> 12:10.797
just because I have
four legs and a tail.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.332
It's wrong, I tell you!

12:12.332 --> 12:14.634
Why don't they care
about what's inside?

12:14.634 --> 12:15.768
Salem, what's on
the inside of you

12:15.768 --> 12:17.670
is a selfish,
misogynistic pig.

12:17.670 --> 12:20.773
Hey! Pigs are people, too.

12:20.773 --> 12:22.041
I may have to break up
with Derek.

12:22.041 --> 12:23.910
His family is just too hideous.

12:23.910 --> 12:27.247
Well, that doesn't mean
that Derek is.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.982
Wow! These long distance
phone companies

12:28.982 --> 12:32.018
will do anything
to get you to switch.

12:32.018 --> 12:33.086
Hello?

12:33.086 --> 12:34.554
Hi, Sabrina.

12:34.554 --> 12:35.555
Hi.

12:35.555 --> 12:38.024
-It's Derek.
-I can see that.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.492
Listen, I just wanted
to apologize again

12:39.492 --> 12:40.860
for what happened tonight.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.729
Forgiven, forgotten.

12:42.729 --> 12:43.997
( <i>muffled speaking</i> )
I'm really sorry.

12:43.997 --> 12:46.165
I wanted tonight
to be perfect.

12:46.165 --> 12:48.334
Sabrina, I really like you,
and I just hope

12:48.334 --> 12:51.170
you won't hold me responsible
for my parents' behavior.

12:51.170 --> 12:52.505
Do you have any idea
how awful it was

12:52.505 --> 12:54.274
to sit through
those horrible jokes?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.576
Why didn't you
say something?

12:56.576 --> 12:58.111
I should have. I...

12:58.111 --> 13:00.513
I just stopped trying
to fight with my parents.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.148
They're set in their ways.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.050
Why do you think
I go to school
in the mortal realm?

13:04.050 --> 13:04.917
Well, I guess I
wouldn't want anyone

13:04.917 --> 13:08.087
to hold my aunts'
behavior against me.

13:08.087 --> 13:10.390
Listen, uh, I just got
front row tickets

13:10.390 --> 13:12.358
to see The Black Hole Surfers
on Friday night

13:12.358 --> 13:14.494
in The Other Realm Forum.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.195
Would you be interested
in going?

13:16.195 --> 13:17.263
Are your parents coming?

13:17.263 --> 13:19.866
-No.
-Pick me up
at 7:00.

13:19.866 --> 13:21.034
( <i>muffled speaking</i> )
Great.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.803
Oh, by the way,
that phone you're holding

13:23.803 --> 13:25.104
it's white chocolate.

13:27.874 --> 13:30.109
Mmm. Belgian.

13:30.109 --> 13:31.177
( <i>muffled</i> ):
Chocolate?

13:31.177 --> 13:32.478
( <i>muffled crying</i> )

13:35.748 --> 13:36.816
Here's your cappuccino

13:36.816 --> 13:39.085
served at the tooth-friendly
temperature of lukewarm.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.753
Ah, thank you.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.822
So, I hear things
are heating up

13:42.822 --> 13:44.357
between you and Derek.

13:44.357 --> 13:47.393
Well, let's just say
we could melt a glacier.

13:47.393 --> 13:50.863
Are you listening to this?
"Derek, Derek, Derek."

13:50.863 --> 13:53.032
What's so special
about Derek anyway?

13:53.032 --> 13:57.470
Well, in alphabetical order,
he's athletic, buff, charismatic

13:57.470 --> 14:00.139
dashing, effervescent,
funny, gorgeous...

14:00.139 --> 14:01.808
It was a rhetorical question.

14:01.808 --> 14:02.709
Oh.

14:02.709 --> 14:05.244
See? Now, that wasn't
too bad, was it?

14:05.244 --> 14:08.648
No. Not after I passed
out from the pain.

14:08.648 --> 14:09.582
( <i>laughs</i> )

14:09.582 --> 14:11.784
Well, this may be
your last visit to my office

14:11.784 --> 14:14.420
but I have a hunch we'll be
seeing a lot more of each other.

14:14.420 --> 14:15.221
Mmm.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.157
Yes. It seems like
Sabrina and Derek

14:18.157 --> 14:19.425
are really hitting it off.

14:19.425 --> 14:21.327
Your niece is
a terrific girl

14:21.327 --> 14:23.029
and what a sense of humor!

14:23.029 --> 14:24.797
She really loved
all my jokes.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.065
Well, I could use a laugh

14:26.065 --> 14:28.701
seeing as how you
just drilled down to
my last good nerve.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.970
Okay. Um...

14:30.970 --> 14:33.272
What has an IQ of 192?

14:33.272 --> 14:34.207
I don't know.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.175
The entire mortal realm.

14:36.175 --> 14:38.077
( <i>laughing</i> )

14:38.077 --> 14:39.979
Sabrina found that funny?

14:39.979 --> 14:40.847
Who wouldn't?

14:40.847 --> 14:42.582
( <i>laughing</i> )

14:42.582 --> 14:45.151
Maybe somebody
who's half mortal.

14:45.151 --> 14:46.753
We don't associate
with people like that

14:46.753 --> 14:48.454
so we've got nothing
to worry about.

14:48.454 --> 14:53.092
I see. Well, this has been
a <i>painful</i> afternoon...

14:53.926 --> 14:55.728
in more ways than one.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.400
Okay, for my date
with Derek

15:00.400 --> 15:02.602
how about this?
-Too long.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.637
Okay.

15:04.637 --> 15:05.271
This?

15:05.271 --> 15:06.939
-Too long.
-Salem!

15:06.939 --> 15:10.243
I'm just saying, don't be afraid
to show some skin.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.611
Oh, you mean like this?

15:11.611 --> 15:13.346
Hey! Are you mad, woman?

15:13.346 --> 15:14.313
I could catch my death.

15:14.313 --> 15:14.781
( <i>whimpering</i> )

15:17.550 --> 15:20.319
Whatever you did, I'm
sure you deserved it.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.188
Hey, Aunt Zelda.
What are you doing here?

15:22.188 --> 15:23.823
Well, I've just come
back from the dentist

15:23.823 --> 15:25.625
and I'm a little concerned.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.727
Does Derek know
you're a half-mortal?

15:27.727 --> 15:29.595
Yeah. I told him
on our first date.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.130
And he was okay with it?

15:31.130 --> 15:34.967
Yeah. Look, his father's
a total bigot

15:34.967 --> 15:36.602
but Derek's not like that.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.304
What makes you so sure?

15:38.304 --> 15:39.372
Well, we talked about it

15:39.372 --> 15:41.140
and he still wants
to go out with me.

15:41.140 --> 15:43.476
He's meeting me in an hour
to go to The Other Realm.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.878
Honey, I don't mean to put
a damper on this

15:45.878 --> 15:47.146
but in my experience

15:47.146 --> 15:49.615
the apple doesn't fall
very far from the tree.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.717
Look, Derek's great.
Everything's fine.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.686
You've got nothing
to worry about.

15:53.686 --> 15:54.987
Then do me a favor.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.422
Since you're going
to The Other Realm

15:56.422 --> 15:58.357
why don't you use
the portal at our house?

15:58.357 --> 16:01.260
That way Hilda and I
can ask him a few questions.

16:01.260 --> 16:03.563
Fine. Whatever.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.998
But first you have to help me
find something to wear.

16:05.998 --> 16:07.633
Salem:
If you find anything
with black fur

16:07.633 --> 16:10.069
and four sleeves,
toss it this way.

16:10.069 --> 16:10.503
( <i>whimpering</i> )

16:13.873 --> 16:15.208
Oh, now, please remember

16:15.208 --> 16:17.109
this is a date,
not the Nuremberg trials.

16:17.109 --> 16:19.579
Keep questions short,
civil and to the point.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.314
Well, <i>I'm</i> out.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.982
Hey, Sabrina. Ready to go?

16:22.982 --> 16:25.284
Almost, um, do you mind
if we sit down for a second?

16:25.284 --> 16:27.220
-My aunts want to
get to know you
a little better.
-Sure.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.922
Hi, Derek. I'm Zelda,
and you've met Hilda.

16:29.922 --> 16:33.559
Ooh! Magic caramel corn.
That's my favorite.

16:33.559 --> 16:35.061
I brought it
for the concert.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.829
You're welcome....
Hilda:
Thanks!

16:36.829 --> 16:38.865
"Guaranteed to tickle
your inside."

16:38.865 --> 16:41.501
Well, I'll be
the judge of that.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.535
Why don't we all
sit down?

16:42.535 --> 16:45.004
( <i>laughing</i> )

16:45.004 --> 16:46.539
Sorry.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.441
So, um, Derek, why don't
you tell my aunts

16:48.441 --> 16:50.910
how much you love
living in the mortal
realm with mortals?

16:50.910 --> 16:52.411
Uh, I like it.

16:52.411 --> 16:53.913
Great! Nice chatting.
Let's go.

16:53.913 --> 16:56.382
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Not so fast.

16:56.382 --> 16:58.217
You know, Derek,
I heard that some witches

16:58.217 --> 17:00.887
want to start a country club
that excludes mortals.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.188
What do you think of that?

17:02.188 --> 17:03.990
That is the last club
that I'd ever join.

17:03.990 --> 17:06.859
( <i>laughing</i> )

17:06.859 --> 17:07.693
Hilda.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.730
Sorry. This corn
is so funny.

17:13.332 --> 17:15.868
Well, surely you'd want
separate golf courses.

17:15.868 --> 17:19.071
Wouldn't really matter to me--
don't play golf.

17:19.071 --> 17:20.973
Oh, listen, uh,
I don't mean to be rude

17:20.973 --> 17:22.108
but we have to get
to the concert.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.142
It starts in half an hour.

17:23.142 --> 17:25.611
Yeah. You know concerts--
they always start early.

17:25.611 --> 17:26.879
-Okay, see you.
-Bye.

17:26.879 --> 17:27.813
Nice meeting you guys.

17:27.813 --> 17:31.284
Well... have fun.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.885
That was thoroughly
unsatisfying.

17:32.885 --> 17:33.586
I had a lot more questions

17:33.586 --> 17:34.887
I wanted to ask him.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.356
Me, too. Like, where
did he get this corn.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.759
( <i>laughing</i> )

17:42.595 --> 17:44.363
Man, that was
a great concert, huh?

17:44.363 --> 17:45.998
Yeah, and look at
this juice bar.

17:45.998 --> 17:47.500
This place is so cool.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.569
You'd never see a place
like this in the mortal realm.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.538
Yeah. That's kind of why
I wanted to bring you here.

17:52.538 --> 17:53.773
In case I haven't
told you lately

17:53.773 --> 17:55.441
you are very special to me.

17:55.441 --> 17:56.309
Well, it's been
three minutes.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.778
I was getting
a little worried.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.646
So, what can
I do you for?

18:00.646 --> 18:02.782
Uh, two Pineapple Tsunamis.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.383
Always the complicated drinks.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.953
Just once I wish
someone would order a Snapple.

18:09.622 --> 18:14.193
Careful. These Tsunamis
can be a little rough.

18:14.193 --> 18:14.627
Oh.

18:16.629 --> 18:17.930
So much for that warning.
I'll be right back.

18:17.930 --> 18:21.300
I think I got a starfish
up my nose.

18:21.300 --> 18:24.103
Hey, buddy, I hope
I'm not out of line here

18:24.103 --> 18:26.305
but your girlfriend
is one good-looking witch.

18:26.305 --> 18:29.241
Thanks. Actually,
she's half mortal.

18:29.241 --> 18:30.176
What'd I tell you, huh?

18:30.176 --> 18:32.044
Can I spot them or what?

18:32.044 --> 18:34.714
You don't have a problem
dating a half mortal?

18:34.714 --> 18:35.982
Why would I have a problem?

18:35.982 --> 18:37.583
Sure, mortals aren't
the smartest

18:37.583 --> 18:41.587
carbon-based life-form,
but, hey, she's a cutie.

18:41.587 --> 18:43.522
Oh, wait-wait-wait. I just heard
a great one. Okay, okay.

18:43.522 --> 18:45.958
How many mortals does it take
to screw in a lightbulb?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.860
-150!
-Derek:
One to hold
the bulb

18:47.860 --> 18:50.429
and 149 to turn the house.

18:50.429 --> 18:51.564
I guess you've heard
that one, huh?

18:51.564 --> 18:53.199
I know them all, man.

18:53.199 --> 18:55.901
What do you call a mortal
with half of a brain?

18:55.901 --> 18:56.669
Gifted.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.437
( <i>laughter</i> )

18:58.437 --> 18:59.805
Love that joke, man.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.107
So, you're just
staying with cutie

19:01.107 --> 19:02.875
until something better
comes along, huh?

19:02.875 --> 19:04.377
Hey, it is not easy to find
a full witch

19:04.377 --> 19:07.346
in the mortal realm--
sometimes you've got to settle.

19:07.346 --> 19:09.749
-Settle?
-Sabrina!

19:09.749 --> 19:10.483
How can you say that?

19:10.483 --> 19:12.451
Is that really
how you feel?
-No.

19:12.451 --> 19:13.786
Why did you say those things and

19:13.786 --> 19:14.954
why are you telling
those idiotic jokes

19:14.954 --> 19:16.155
when you know
how much they hurt me?

19:16.155 --> 19:18.257
Come on, I didn't
mean anything by it.

19:18.257 --> 19:20.726
I'm with a couple of guys.
That's what guys do.

19:20.726 --> 19:22.461
Yeah, well,
this is what I do.

19:22.461 --> 19:24.897
Sabrina, wait.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.465
-You're making
a big mistake.
-Am I?

19:26.465 --> 19:27.299
Derek tell me the truth.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.501
Could you ever
get seriously involved

19:28.501 --> 19:30.102
with someone
who wasn't a full witch?

19:30.102 --> 19:31.470
We're having fun.

19:31.470 --> 19:32.538
Don't get all mortal on me.

19:32.538 --> 19:34.407
Don't worry-- there's
a whole other side to me.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.075
This date is officially over.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.981
That's okay, Sweetie.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.549
There's plenty of fish
in the sea.

19:43.549 --> 19:47.820
Back off, slime ball,
and get your furry mitts off me.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.822
Sorry, honey.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.691
Oh, you must
feel terrible.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.060
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda,
what are you doing here?

19:54.060 --> 19:55.628
We came to seek
the truth.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.263
Sorry we had to get ugly on you.

19:57.263 --> 19:59.231
Normally, I'd be
really mad at you, but...

19:59.231 --> 20:02.268
desperate times call
for desperate measures.

20:02.268 --> 20:03.502
What was I thinking?

20:03.502 --> 20:04.637
You were thinking
that you met

20:04.637 --> 20:07.306
the one guy out there
who's not a jerk.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.308
<i>Is</i> there a guy out there
who's not a jerk?

20:09.308 --> 20:11.377
Of course there is.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.245
Sabrina, I don't know
if he'll be a witch

20:13.245 --> 20:14.447
I don't know
if he'll be a mortal

20:14.447 --> 20:16.982
but I know there's someone
out there for you.

20:16.982 --> 20:19.185
Is there someone
out there for me?

20:19.185 --> 20:21.620
You know, I heard they make
really great Tsunamis here.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.289
I asked you a question.

20:23.289 --> 20:25.091
Very frothy,
with just a hint of mint.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.625
I demand an answer.

20:26.625 --> 20:29.495
Is there somebody out there
for <i>me?</i>

20:34.700 --> 20:36.902
I think you just killed
happy hour.

20:44.643 --> 20:46.545
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

20:48.981 --> 20:49.982
Hello?

20:49.982 --> 20:52.785
Hey, Sabrina.
I'm surprised to find you home.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.186
It's 2:00 in the morning.

20:54.186 --> 20:57.223
Exactly. I've been leaving
messages for Morgan since 9:00.

20:57.223 --> 20:59.091
Oh, she went to bed early.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.259
She has a spa appointment
tomorrow

21:00.259 --> 21:01.961
and she wants
to be well rested.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.897
Oh. Well, how are things going
with you and Derek?

21:04.897 --> 21:07.299
They're gone. It's over.

21:07.299 --> 21:10.603
Oh... I'm really sorry
to hear that.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.805
Thanks, Josh.
I'll tell Morgan you called.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.940
Thanks.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.475
Man, am I tired.

21:16.475 --> 21:17.376
Good night, Salem.

21:17.376 --> 21:19.779
Good night, Sabrina.

21:22.581 --> 21:25.851
Oh, do you mind?

21:25.851 --> 21:26.752
Sorry.

21:26.752 --> 21:29.388
I thought you were going
to stay up and read.

21:29.388 --> 21:30.122
( <i>sighs</i> )
