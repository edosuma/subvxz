00:01.501 --> 00:02.068
This is the Evergreen

00:02.068 --> 00:02.469
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.236 --> 00:03.269
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.607 --> 00:10.076
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.076 --> 00:11.678
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.113 --> 00:15.115
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.216 --> 00:17.250
Yikes!

00:17.817 --> 00:19.185
Yaaaah...

00:22.055 --> 00:23.456
Yeaaaah!

00:23.456 --> 00:26.326
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.733 --> 00:36.036
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.771 --> 00:39.039
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.876 --> 00:44.844
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:45.712 --> 00:47.147
the Raccoons!!

00:47.147 --> 00:49.682
â™ª (show theme music) â™ª

01:00.894 --> 01:03.029
The Evergreen Forest.

01:03.029 --> 01:06.066
Today it has blue skies,
lazy white clouds

01:06.066 --> 01:07.734
and a warm breeze.

01:07.734 --> 01:08.902
Great weather,

01:08.902 --> 01:10.370
unless you're feeling under it,

01:10.370 --> 01:11.771
like Cyril Sneer.

01:11.771 --> 01:14.007
Achoo! Aaachoo!

01:16.176 --> 01:18.111
Dr. Canard: Oh, let's see now.

01:18.111 --> 01:19.579
Alright Dr. Canard,

01:19.579 --> 01:21.181
out with the straight goods!

01:21.181 --> 01:23.650
Oh, is that thing ever cold!

01:23.650 --> 01:25.018
Dr. Canard: Cough, please.

01:25.018 --> 01:26.319
Achooo!

01:26.319 --> 01:27.754
Dr. Canard: Aaaah...

01:27.754 --> 01:29.189
This is your second visit

01:29.189 --> 01:30.890
and I'm not feeling any better.

01:30.890 --> 01:34.160
I hardly even feel like losing
my temper! Now, what's up?

01:34.160 --> 01:36.096
Dr. Canard: Well,
for starters, not you,

01:36.096 --> 01:37.931
you're to stay in bed and
take plenty of fluids

01:37.931 --> 01:40.133
until I get the results
from your tests.

01:40.133 --> 01:42.869
The Pig: Dr. Canard! Dr. Canard!

01:42.869 --> 01:45.138
There's an urgent
phone call for you!

01:45.138 --> 01:46.840
The Pig 2: It's Dr. Auto.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.109
Dr. Canard:
Hmm, it's the clinic.

01:49.109 --> 01:52.078
It's not like them to call
unless it's something serious.

01:53.346 --> 01:55.215
Something serious?!

01:55.215 --> 01:57.784
Get out there and listen
in on his conversation!

01:59.352 --> 02:01.387
Achooo!

02:01.387 --> 02:03.556
Dr. Canard: Hello?
Yeah, Dr. Canard?

02:03.556 --> 02:06.226
Lefty here at
Dr. Auto's Car clinic.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.495
How are you?
Dr. Canard: Oh, fine.

02:08.495 --> 02:11.898
I'm here treating a loud mouth
complainer with a bad cold.

02:11.898 --> 02:13.199
And what about my car?

02:13.199 --> 02:14.801
It looks like the
car is going to need

02:14.801 --> 02:16.536
a complete overhaul.

02:16.536 --> 02:19.706
Dr. Canard: What?!
Valves? Shot?!

02:19.706 --> 02:22.008
The Pig: Valves?!
It's his heart!

02:22.008 --> 02:24.944
Dr. Canard: Serious, you say?
The Pig 2: Serious?!

02:24.944 --> 02:26.613
Dr. Canard: Done in a few days?

02:26.613 --> 02:30.116
The Pig 3: The boss has
only got a few days to live!

02:30.583 --> 02:33.253
Dr. Canard: Well, there's
nothing more I can do here.

02:33.253 --> 02:36.055
Besides, I tee off
in 20 minutes.

02:36.055 --> 02:37.757
So what is it?

02:38.491 --> 02:41.895
The Pig 3: Well, Sir,
it's like this.

02:41.895 --> 02:45.999
You're heading to that
big vault in the sky.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.668
The Pig 1: The big guy
has called in your loan.

02:48.668 --> 02:49.936
The Pig 2: If I were you, Sir,

02:49.936 --> 02:53.706
I'd act on any once-in-a-
lifetime offer right now.

02:53.706 --> 02:55.441
What are you
blabbering about?

02:55.441 --> 02:59.112
The Pig 1: Your
illness is, um.. is...

02:59.112 --> 03:00.180
Is what?!

03:00.180 --> 03:02.148
The Pig:

03:02.148 --> 03:03.316
...terminal!

03:03.316 --> 03:05.852
The Pigs:

03:10.823 --> 03:12.125
Oh no!

03:12.125 --> 03:14.294
Oh, not again!

03:18.164 --> 03:19.966
Hey, what's going on here?

03:19.966 --> 03:23.469
Your faces are longer than a
line-up at a banking machine.

03:24.671 --> 03:27.607
It's the press again
Bert, it's broken down.

03:27.607 --> 03:29.609
Hmmm, er um...

03:29.609 --> 03:31.010
that old thing, huh?

03:31.010 --> 03:33.646
Yeah, well, you know, guys,
things can't last forever.

03:33.646 --> 03:36.349
Oh, here's the money
from my collections.

03:36.349 --> 03:37.984
And here's your salary.

03:37.984 --> 03:40.887
Thanks Ralph.
Well see you guys later!

03:40.887 --> 03:42.822
Come on, Broo.

03:42.822 --> 03:46.292
All work and no play
makes Bert a dull Raccoon!

03:47.227 --> 03:48.995
This press
is definitely

03:48.995 --> 03:51.097
on its last legs, gang.

03:51.965 --> 03:55.868
Boy, Broo, the gang sure was
down about that press.

03:55.868 --> 03:57.704
But it won't be for long.

03:57.704 --> 04:00.540
With Cedric investing
this money for me,

04:00.540 --> 04:02.508
I'll have enough
to surprise them

04:02.508 --> 04:05.011
with a brand new printing press!

04:05.011 --> 04:07.847
Yeeeehooo!

04:12.652 --> 04:16.489
Good day, fine gentleman!
Is Cedric home?

04:16.489 --> 04:19.592
The Pig: Master Cedric is
away at accounting camp!

04:19.592 --> 04:20.593
Oh!

04:20.593 --> 04:22.629
The Pig 2: But in this
time of emergency,

04:22.629 --> 04:24.397
we've sent word for him.

04:24.397 --> 04:26.232
Time of emergency!?

04:26.232 --> 04:28.334
What's the matter?
Somebody die?

04:28.334 --> 04:31.204
The Pig:
The Pig 2: It's the boss!

04:31.204 --> 04:35.174
The Doctor's giving him
only a few days to live.

04:38.511 --> 04:40.513
That's a good one, guys!

04:41.581 --> 04:42.915
Hilarious!

04:43.750 --> 04:46.419
Excuse me!
Hey, pardon me.

04:46.419 --> 04:49.389
Delivery for the late
Cyril Sneer.

04:49.389 --> 04:52.058
The late Cyril Sneer?

04:52.058 --> 04:54.594
Well,
not quite yet, but

04:54.594 --> 04:57.263
according to this,
it won't be long now,

04:57.263 --> 04:58.464
if you know, what I mean.

04:59.899 --> 05:02.769
The Pig: That's the boss.
He needs us.

05:05.271 --> 05:07.240
How dare you
leave your weak and

05:07.240 --> 05:09.108
sickly employer to his deathbed?

05:11.644 --> 05:14.147
I'm fading faster
than a pair of jeans!

05:14.147 --> 05:16.282
You three clods are forcing me

05:16.282 --> 05:18.184
to waste my last breath on you!

05:18.184 --> 05:19.819
Ah!

05:19.819 --> 05:22.455
Oh, I hope, you careless hams

05:22.455 --> 05:24.824
aren't counting on
being in my will.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.294
The only thing you deserve to be
in is the unemployment line!

05:28.294 --> 05:29.829
The Pigs: Oh!
What are you doing here?

05:30.430 --> 05:32.265
(sadly) Death bed?!

05:32.265 --> 05:34.100
Last breaths?

05:34.100 --> 05:35.635
Will?!

05:35.635 --> 05:37.437
So, it's true!

05:37.437 --> 05:38.705
Every word of it!

05:38.705 --> 05:41.507
The Big Guy has
cashed in my IOU.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.809
Geez...

05:42.809 --> 05:45.745
When I think of
all the lying and cheating,

05:45.745 --> 05:48.014
I've subjected myself to,

05:48.014 --> 05:50.950
the years I've spent
amassing my fortune,

05:50.950 --> 05:53.920
the people close to me
I've had to push aside.

05:54.887 --> 05:57.457
Oooh, and then I think
of the bad stuff!

05:59.325 --> 06:03.196
My only friend has been the
almighty buck, Raccoon.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.665
But bucks don't
make great friends.

06:05.665 --> 06:07.867
They don't remember
you once you're gone.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.704
Is Cyril Sneer's
most lasting legacy,

06:11.704 --> 06:15.875
bank account number 105609?

06:15.875 --> 06:18.344
Gosh, I know
we've had a lot of

06:18.344 --> 06:20.847
differences in the past, Cyril,

06:20.847 --> 06:23.316
but I think we should
put them aside.

06:23.316 --> 06:26.152
There's nothing you
can do for me now, Raccoon.

06:26.152 --> 06:28.020
There's nothing anyone can do.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.455
Yes, there is!

06:29.455 --> 06:30.790
The Pigs:
Aaah,

06:30.790 --> 06:32.392
a memorial could be built,

06:32.392 --> 06:35.328
a grand testament, yeah!

06:35.328 --> 06:39.499
Something concrete that
will leave Cyril Sneer

06:39.499 --> 06:43.169
the most remembered
name in history.

06:43.169 --> 06:44.704
Ah, do you mean that?

06:44.704 --> 06:47.740
Yes, it's the
least I can do for you.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.242
The Pig: Hold it, Raccoon!

06:49.242 --> 06:52.578
Where would you ever get
the money to do that?

06:52.578 --> 06:53.579
The Pigs: Yeah!

06:53.579 --> 06:55.615
Money is no problem!

06:55.615 --> 06:57.450
Cedric and I have been investing

06:57.450 --> 06:59.685
a lot of my hard earned
paper route earnings

06:59.685 --> 07:01.354
to buy a new printing press

07:01.354 --> 07:03.256
for the Evergreen Standard.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.524
A new press?!

07:04.524 --> 07:07.026
And Cedric has
been helping you!?

07:07.026 --> 07:09.562
Yeah! We've
almost reached our goal.

07:09.562 --> 07:12.865
But I'll use that money
Cyril Sneer,

07:12.865 --> 07:14.567
to erect you a monument

07:14.567 --> 07:18.704
that'll make the pyramids
look like a corner store!

07:18.704 --> 07:20.206
Leave it to me!

07:23.309 --> 07:25.912
The Pig: Hey, you don't think
the boss would leave his fortune

07:25.912 --> 07:29.148
to that middling Raccoon,
instead of us, do you?

07:29.148 --> 07:31.517
The Pig 2:
We can't let that happen.

07:31.517 --> 07:34.153
We've slaved for him for years.

07:34.153 --> 07:37.089
The Pig 3: We'll just have to
out-do that Raccoon, boys!

07:37.089 --> 07:39.525
To really impress the boss,

07:39.525 --> 07:42.862
we'll.. why, we'll cure him!

07:42.862 --> 07:44.130
The Pig 2: Cure him?!

07:44.130 --> 07:46.499
But we don't even know,
what he's got!

07:46.499 --> 07:49.435
The Pig 3: Sure, we do!
At least 4 billion!

07:49.435 --> 07:51.471
And we're gonna get it!

07:51.471 --> 07:53.372
The Pigs: Ooooh! Goodie!

07:56.108 --> 07:57.310
The Pig 3: Hello?

07:57.310 --> 07:59.445
Yes! Well, certainly!

08:00.279 --> 08:01.347
He's what?!

08:01.814 --> 08:02.815
When?

08:04.116 --> 08:07.920
Oh, yes, I'll be sure
he gets the message.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.222
The Pig 2: Who is that?

08:09.222 --> 08:12.592
The Pig 3: The doctor's office
calling to check up on the boss!

08:12.592 --> 08:16.496
They said that if he takes
his medicine regularly,

08:16.496 --> 08:19.499
his cold should be
gone in no time!

08:19.499 --> 08:22.602
The Pig 2:
What? The boss has gotta cold?!

08:22.602 --> 08:25.471
You mean he's not dying?

08:25.471 --> 08:27.440
The Pig 1: Oh, we'd better
tell him right away.

08:27.440 --> 08:31.410
The Pig 3: Not so fast.
He doesn't know that.

08:31.410 --> 08:35.348
And what the boss doesn't
know, won't kill him!

08:35.348 --> 08:39.986
You see, if we can convince
him that we've cured him...

08:39.986 --> 08:41.988
The Pig 1:

08:41.988 --> 08:44.824
then we're sure
will be in his will!

08:44.824 --> 08:48.361
The Pigs:

08:50.263 --> 08:50.830
Okay, keep your fingers

08:50.830 --> 08:53.199
Okay, keep your
fingers crossed everybody!

08:53.199 --> 08:55.968
It's time to see how our
front page will turn out.

09:00.840 --> 09:05.811
Beans baked by new
high-powered engine block?

09:05.811 --> 09:08.047
Ohh no,
I was afraid of that.

09:08.047 --> 09:11.450
Ralph,
this press has got to go.

09:11.450 --> 09:15.021
Gee, we've been through
such an awful lot together,

09:15.021 --> 09:16.722
Not as much as we have

09:16.722 --> 09:19.325
with Cyril Sneer!
What?!

09:19.325 --> 09:22.662
I've just come back
from a Sneer mansion and...

09:22.662 --> 09:26.299
and.. Cyril is dying.

09:26.299 --> 09:29.535
What?!
I don't believe it!

09:29.535 --> 09:32.138
Mean, old Cyril Sneer?

09:32.138 --> 09:35.408
Greedy,
conniving, Cyril Sneer?

09:35.408 --> 09:38.711
Scheming, tight-
fisted, Cyril Sneer?

09:39.278 --> 09:41.247
Cedric's dad!

09:41.247 --> 09:43.683
Ohh, poor Cedric!

09:43.683 --> 09:44.750
How's he taking it?

09:44.750 --> 09:47.386
(gasps) Cedric's
away at accounting camp!

09:47.386 --> 09:48.921
Does he know yet?

09:48.921 --> 09:50.389
They've sent for him,

09:50.389 --> 09:52.625
but since he can't be here,

09:52.625 --> 09:55.261
we'll have to act the way
he would if he were here.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.596
What can we do?

09:56.596 --> 09:59.532
Cedric would make the
last days of his father's life

09:59.532 --> 10:02.969
his best days and that's
what we're going to do.

10:02.969 --> 10:06.639
Yeah! By building
Cyril Sneer a legacy!

10:06.639 --> 10:09.909
We'll make sure
he's remembered forever!

10:12.178 --> 10:12.578
The Pig: In order to

10:12.578 --> 10:14.413
The Pig: In order
to convince the boss,

10:14.413 --> 10:17.550
it's got to look
like real medicine.

10:17.550 --> 10:20.453
The Pig 1: And taste like it!

10:23.556 --> 10:26.459
Aaachhh! Ah-oh-aaah!

10:26.459 --> 10:30.429
This stuff tastes like the
inside of a shoe. Ech!

10:30.429 --> 10:32.298
The Pig 3:
Then what are we waiting for?

10:33.132 --> 10:34.767
How's my legacy coming?

10:34.767 --> 10:36.102
Well, uhm..on...

10:36.102 --> 10:38.571
Tell me, what size is it?

10:38.571 --> 10:42.108
Um, I-I'm not sure yet.

10:42.108 --> 10:45.344
Ah! Keeping it a
surprise. Ha. How thoughful.

10:45.344 --> 10:47.413
The Pig: We've done it!
We've done it!

10:47.413 --> 10:49.915
Done what?!
The Pig: We found a cure!

10:49.915 --> 10:52.084
The Pig 2: Here, Sir, try it.

10:52.084 --> 10:54.220
Well, I suppose,
I've got nothing to lose.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.459
Except my lunch!

11:00.459 --> 11:03.629
The Pig: Gee, you're looking
better already, Sir.

11:04.697 --> 11:07.099
Well, perhaps it could use

11:07.099 --> 11:09.068
a little fine tuning.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.508
It sure was nice of Cyril
to let me use the library

11:15.508 --> 11:17.376
to research his monument.

11:17.376 --> 11:18.611
The Bear: Ahem.

11:19.478 --> 11:21.614
These are the books

11:21.614 --> 11:24.784
the boss wants you
to look at, Sir.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.085
Hmm...

11:26.085 --> 11:28.320
'Statues through the ages',

11:28.320 --> 11:32.625
'Statues as a lasting monument
to true greatness'.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.094
Wow, this is just, what I need!

11:35.861 --> 11:37.763
Hey, look at this!

11:38.330 --> 11:39.899
Hmmm...

11:39.899 --> 11:41.367
That's it!

11:41.367 --> 11:45.371
The perfect monument
for Cyril Sneer!

11:45.371 --> 11:46.639
Yaaahooo!

11:53.879 --> 11:56.182
The Pigs: Oiiiink!

11:57.483 --> 12:00.219
The Pig: Am I correct in
assuming that this medicine

12:00.219 --> 12:03.022
didn't make you feel
any better, Sir?

12:07.693 --> 12:08.861
Hello?

12:08.861 --> 12:11.530
Yes, of course,
this is Cyril Sneer.

12:11.530 --> 12:13.666
Well,
what's left of him.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.901
Dr. Canard, what do you want?

12:17.169 --> 12:18.738
You want your bill paid?!

12:18.738 --> 12:20.906
Need to pay off your green fees?

12:20.906 --> 12:24.143
How dare you saddle me
with bills when I'm dying?

12:25.644 --> 12:28.013
What?!

12:28.547 --> 12:30.182
You mean, I'm not dying?

12:30.182 --> 12:31.917
I've only got a cold?

12:31.917 --> 12:34.587
Ha-haaa! In that case,
I'll pay you

12:34.587 --> 12:36.889
when I'm good and ready,
you overbearing quack!

12:37.890 --> 12:40.359
I'm going to live!
I'm going to live!

12:40.359 --> 12:41.393
I'm going to...

12:41.393 --> 12:43.763
The Bear:
Bert Raccoon is here, sir.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.367
Sorry it took me
so long, Cyril,

12:48.367 --> 12:51.871
but I finally found the
perfect memorial for you!

12:51.871 --> 12:55.374
Ohh... you have?

12:55.374 --> 12:56.842
How touching.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.044
But it'll have to be quick.

12:59.044 --> 13:01.580
I'm going fast.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.949
It's going
to be tough to do.

13:03.949 --> 13:07.386
Oh, but if
anybody can do the job,

13:07.386 --> 13:10.089
it's you,
my little raccoon buddy.

13:10.089 --> 13:13.893
I know you won't be wasting
your time on any itsy bitsy

13:13.893 --> 13:15.594
little monument, will you?

13:15.594 --> 13:18.697
Certainly not. I'll be
working 'round the clock

13:18.697 --> 13:21.267
to get every cent I can.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.938
This is it! By using
that lame-brained rodent,

13:25.938 --> 13:28.374
I'll be getting the
best of both worlds.

13:28.374 --> 13:32.111
That newspaper will be
history, and so will I!

13:36.949 --> 13:40.119
Well Broo,
here we go again!

13:40.119 --> 13:42.822
Another day, another dollar.

13:42.822 --> 13:52.097
â™ª Turn back the hands
of time tonight â™ª

13:52.097 --> 13:59.772
â™ª Turn 'round the score while
there's still time â™ª

13:59.772 --> 14:07.346
â™ª Can't you hear our song
on the radio? â™ª

14:07.346 --> 14:10.950
â™ª Song on the radio â™ª

14:10.950 --> 14:21.293
â™ª Turn back the sands of time,
it's late â™ª

14:21.293 --> 14:28.767
â™ª We're all alone and the
night can't wait â™ª

14:28.767 --> 14:37.309
â™ª Where are the friends
we used to know? â™ª

14:37.309 --> 14:40.246
â™ª Friends we used to know â™ª

14:47.019 --> 14:50.723
â™ª Stop the clock,
it's now or never â™ª

14:50.723 --> 14:56.695
â™ª Hold me close before
it slips away â™ª

14:56.695 --> 15:01.967
â™ª Stop the clock or
it's lost forever â™ª

15:01.967 --> 15:08.374
â™ª What we've got is more
than words can say â™ª

15:08.374 --> 15:09.909
â™ª Stop the clock â™ª

15:10.743 --> 15:13.479
How's your tribute
to Cyril coming along, Ralph?

15:13.479 --> 15:15.648
Oh fine, fine.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.683
Let me read you
what I've got so far.

15:17.683 --> 15:19.818
When all
is said and done,

15:19.818 --> 15:21.220
one can honestly say,

15:21.220 --> 15:25.591
that Cyril Sneer
was truly, truly...

15:25.591 --> 15:28.560
Yes?
That's as far as I got.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.496
Do you think it's too long?

15:30.496 --> 15:32.932
Aaah!
Bert, are you alright?

15:32.932 --> 15:35.501
You look absolutely exhausted.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.773
Well, I am a little tired.

15:40.773 --> 15:41.941
I think
it would be best

15:41.941 --> 15:43.776
if you went to bed right away.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.577
No time, Melissa.

15:45.577 --> 15:47.446
I'm working the next shift.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.750
Hmm.. What is he up to?

15:53.052 --> 15:54.853
No, I don't wanna
buy any of that stock!

15:54.853 --> 15:56.455
Who is it?!

15:56.455 --> 15:58.924
It's me, Bert Raccoon.

15:58.924 --> 16:00.459
Well get...

16:00.459 --> 16:02.861
...in here right away.

16:02.861 --> 16:06.765
I-I feel I'm fading fast.

16:06.765 --> 16:10.803
Ohh Bert, Bert Raccoon?

16:10.803 --> 16:12.938
Is that you?

16:12.938 --> 16:16.942
My eyes, they're
so old and feeble.

16:18.277 --> 16:22.081
I'm afraid I've got
some bad news for you, Cyril.

16:22.081 --> 16:23.983
Bad news?

16:23.983 --> 16:27.086
I'm doing
everything I can,

16:27.086 --> 16:28.587
but even at this rate,

16:28.587 --> 16:31.123
I won't be able to
get the monument

16:31.123 --> 16:33.092
for at least a month!

16:33.092 --> 16:34.259
A month?!

16:34.259 --> 16:36.462
It just doesn't
look like I'm going to get

16:36.462 --> 16:38.731
all the money together in time.

16:38.731 --> 16:41.567
Nonsense!
Uh, I mean...

16:41.567 --> 16:43.535
Perhaps I can help you out.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.672
Will this do the trick?

16:48.974 --> 16:50.943
I'll say!

16:50.943 --> 16:54.513
And it'll help buy the plaque
I thought I'd never get!

16:54.513 --> 16:58.584
Telling the whole world
all about Cyril Sneer.

16:58.584 --> 17:01.353
Will it be ready
for the tribute tonight?

17:01.353 --> 17:04.123
Tonight?! Tonight?

17:04.123 --> 17:09.294
Yes, I plan the last
gathering with my close friends.

17:09.294 --> 17:11.363
So you must hurry, Bert.

17:11.797 --> 17:15.334
Hurry. My time is almost up.

17:15.334 --> 17:17.603
The Pigs: Time for
the next cure, Sir.

17:17.603 --> 17:20.172
You see, I was right.

17:24.076 --> 17:25.377
The Pig: Back to the lab.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.848
I've done it!
Not only will that check

17:29.848 --> 17:32.851
guarantee me my statue
with a plaque,

17:32.851 --> 17:35.687
but that Raccoon has
spent all his savings!

17:35.687 --> 17:38.457
That printing press
and that newspaper

17:38.457 --> 17:40.359
are junkyard material!

17:45.831 --> 17:48.367
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:48.367 --> 17:51.036
we are gathered here
this evening

17:51.036 --> 17:53.138
for a sad occasion.

17:53.672 --> 17:56.442
To honor one of
Evergreen Forests'

17:56.442 --> 17:59.845
most venerable citizens.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.847
Won't you please welcome

18:01.847 --> 18:04.650
our distinguished
guest of honor,

18:04.650 --> 18:06.919
Cyril Sneer.

18:08.187 --> 18:09.955
Let the tributes begin.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.993
Ehm-ehm.
Ode to Cyril Sneer,

18:14.993 --> 18:16.562
by Ralph Raccoon.

18:17.229 --> 18:20.599
Four score and $7 billion
dollars ago,

18:20.599 --> 18:23.902
Cyril Sneer set forth
into the world...

18:23.902 --> 18:26.705
...we can honestly say

18:26.705 --> 18:30.342
that Cyril Sneer
was without a doubt,

18:30.342 --> 18:32.244
truly pink.

18:34.346 --> 18:35.347
Bravo!

18:35.948 --> 18:37.716
Wh-what a beautiful speech!

18:37.716 --> 18:39.351
Where is Bert?

18:39.351 --> 18:40.786
Ehm-ehm...

18:40.786 --> 18:44.022
We've heard about
Cyril Sneer in words.

18:44.022 --> 18:46.592
Now let's remember him
through pictures.

18:47.526 --> 18:48.627
Oops.

18:49.995 --> 18:53.098
Here is 5 year old
Cyril and his father.

18:53.098 --> 18:55.801
Dad is asking for an
advance on his allowance.

18:55.801 --> 19:00.105
At age 7, Cyril's family
moves to a new home.

19:00.105 --> 19:01.907
Cyril has evicted them.

19:01.907 --> 19:04.409
Ooh, I'm fading fast!

19:04.409 --> 19:06.812
Um, here's Cyril at 10,

19:06.812 --> 19:08.480
Cyril at 15,

19:08.480 --> 19:09.948
Cyril at 20,

19:09.948 --> 19:11.783
I'm fading faster!

19:11.783 --> 19:13.952
30, 40, 50...

19:17.789 --> 19:23.395
â™ª Should old
aquaintance be forgot â™ª

19:23.395 --> 19:25.464
Where is that
blasted Raccoon?

19:25.464 --> 19:27.065
It would be just like him,

19:27.065 --> 19:29.301
to skip town with my cash!

19:32.437 --> 19:34.139
And now, for the moment

19:34.139 --> 19:36.575
you've all been waiting for.

19:36.575 --> 19:38.810
It's about time!

19:38.810 --> 19:41.013
The Pigs: For another cure!

19:41.013 --> 19:44.016
The only thing that's
gonna be cured around here

19:44.016 --> 19:45.450
is you hams!

19:52.191 --> 19:55.160
Please excuse the interruption.
Do go on.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.995
Um-oh, okay.

19:58.297 --> 20:00.132
Cyril Sneer,

20:00.132 --> 20:03.302
responsible for so many
memorable moments

20:03.302 --> 20:05.304
in everybody's life.

20:05.304 --> 20:06.638
And responsible for...

20:06.638 --> 20:08.607
...your demise!

20:10.108 --> 20:13.178
Mr Sneer, you shouldn't
be running around like that.

20:13.178 --> 20:15.514
Ha-ha, I've
never felt better!

20:15.514 --> 20:16.949
You're not dying?!

20:16.949 --> 20:19.117
Dying?
The only death knells

20:19.117 --> 20:22.120
that'll be ringing around here
are for your newspaper.

20:22.120 --> 20:25.724
Your monument to me has
put you out of business.

20:25.724 --> 20:26.725
Ha-haaa!

20:28.160 --> 20:29.328
Oooh!

20:29.328 --> 20:31.463
It's a new
printing press!

20:32.664 --> 20:35.000
It was thanks
to your generosity,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.002
that I got idea, Cyril.

20:37.002 --> 20:39.338
You let me look
around your library,

20:39.338 --> 20:41.840
and there, it hit me!

20:41.840 --> 20:44.876
That the printed
word is handed down

20:44.876 --> 20:47.179
from generation to generation.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.381
It lasts forever!

20:50.082 --> 20:52.818
So, this is our tribute to you!

20:52.818 --> 20:55.254
The Cyril Sneer

20:55.254 --> 20:57.522
Memorial Printing Press!

21:04.863 --> 21:05.497
Gee, Bert, that was awfully

21:05.497 --> 21:08.267
Gee, Bert, that was
awfully thoughtful of you,

21:08.267 --> 21:10.569
saving your money to buy
a printing press.

21:10.569 --> 21:12.104
Aaah, I was only doing

21:12.104 --> 21:14.473
what I thought
was best for everyone,

21:14.473 --> 21:16.608
Cyril Sneer included.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.612
Ah, well, I'm exhausted.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.548
Good night, Bert!
Good night, guys.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.789
The Cyril Sneer
Memorial Printing Press,

21:30.789 --> 21:33.091
would toil on for years.

21:33.091 --> 21:35.961
Yet, no matter how greasy
or soiled it got,

21:35.961 --> 21:39.531
the plaque always seemed
to glow and shimmer.

21:39.531 --> 21:43.402
Almost, as if it had been
just recently polished

21:43.402 --> 21:44.803
by loving hands.

21:44.803 --> 21:45.871
Oh!

21:48.106 --> 21:49.408
â™ª (show theme music) â™ª

21:52.044 --> 22:05.457
â™ª When darkness falls â™ª

22:05.457 --> 22:07.993
â™ª Leaving shadows in the night â™ª

22:07.993 --> 22:12.130
â™ª Don't be afraid â™ª

22:12.130 --> 22:14.800
â™ª Wipe that fear
from your eyes. â™ª

22:14.800 --> 22:18.170
â™ª A desperate love â™ª

22:18.170 --> 22:21.840
â™ª Keeps on driving you wrong. â™ª

22:21.840 --> 22:25.243
â™ª Don't be afraid. â™ª

22:25.243 --> 22:27.646
â™ª You're not alone. â™ª

22:27.646 --> 22:31.516
â™ª You can run with us â™ª

22:31.516 --> 22:36.521
â™ª We've got
everything you need â™ª

22:36.521 --> 22:38.523
â™ª Run with us â™ª

22:38.523 --> 22:42.027
â™ª We are free â™ª

22:42.027 --> 22:45.497
â™ª Come with us â™ª

22:45.497 --> 22:51.103
â™ª I see passion in your eyes â™ª

22:51.103 --> 22:52.371
â™ª Run with us â™ª
