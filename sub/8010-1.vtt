00:03.463 --> 00:05.796
Hey! Magician lady!

00:05.799 --> 00:08.066
Did you disappear
my fruit again?

00:08.067 --> 00:09.367
Oh! Wow!

00:09.369 --> 00:11.003
Huh? Uh, no, Steve,
it's probably

00:11.005 --> 00:13.505
up your ass,
next to that giant stick, huh?

00:13.506 --> 00:14.872
I can't believe this woman.

00:14.875 --> 00:18.477
Hey, never said my show
was rated G, people.

00:18.478 --> 00:19.878
Never said it.

00:20.681 --> 00:23.748
Does this... belong to you?

00:23.751 --> 00:25.317
How'd you do that?

00:25.318 --> 00:27.152
It's magic, dude.
Now, if you'll look

00:27.153 --> 00:30.422
in the pocket of your hoodie, I
think you got something for me.

00:32.026 --> 00:33.991
♪ Ta-da! ♪ My booze!

00:33.993 --> 00:35.527
That's so cool!

00:35.529 --> 00:37.628
Why don't you get a
five-spot from your dad

00:37.631 --> 00:39.865
- and put it in the hat, okay?
- Okay.

00:39.866 --> 00:41.466
Okay. One of these.

00:41.468 --> 00:43.335
Are these enough
radishes for a party?

00:43.337 --> 00:45.237
I don't know,
how many rabbits did you invite?

00:45.238 --> 00:46.804
Ha! It's for the crudités.

00:46.807 --> 00:49.508
- Come on, let's just cater it.
- Oh, lazy much?

00:49.509 --> 00:50.776
It is our first party

00:50.777 --> 00:52.344
since we moved in together...

00:52.345 --> 00:53.744
We can make the appetizers.

00:53.746 --> 00:54.813
Fine.

00:54.814 --> 00:55.914
Ooh!

00:55.915 --> 00:57.582
Oh, I love this.

00:57.585 --> 00:59.116
Is this Latin American cotton?

00:59.118 --> 01:01.018
I went to El Salvador last year

01:01.021 --> 01:02.588
on this ridiculous surf trip.

01:02.590 --> 01:04.256
- Cool.
- So good.

01:04.257 --> 01:05.757
Another scarf? I didn't agree

01:05.759 --> 01:07.725
to move in with
Steven Tyler's mic stand.

01:07.727 --> 01:09.093
- Mm.
- Mm.

01:09.096 --> 01:10.896
Guys, I think I'm gonna hit up

01:10.897 --> 01:12.263
an earlier yoga class.

01:12.266 --> 01:15.200
- Oh, at that place? MRSA alert.
- I know,

01:15.201 --> 01:17.034
but I've got
a commercial audition later,

01:17.037 --> 01:18.831
and I need to clear my head...
I'm nervous.

01:18.864 --> 01:20.573
All right, text me later, let
me know how it goes.

01:20.637 --> 01:21.850
Yes, Mom.

01:23.243 --> 01:24.643
Okay, let's go.

01:24.644 --> 01:26.072
All right.

01:28.314 --> 01:29.381
Oh!

01:29.382 --> 01:30.716
I'm so sorry!

01:30.718 --> 01:32.317
Look what the clumsy
magician lady did.

01:32.319 --> 01:35.087
Oh, no worries.
Accidents happen.

01:35.088 --> 01:38.055
Well, that's a very
sweet thing to say.

01:38.057 --> 01:41.393
I'll bet you're a very
sweet person, Dr. Allison.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.790
How did you know my name?
And that I'm a doctor.

01:44.831 --> 01:47.265
- Have we met?
- It feels like it, doesn't it?

01:47.268 --> 01:49.200
It's like we've known each other
all our lives.

01:49.203 --> 01:52.103
Like we have a psychic,
spiritual connection.

01:53.087 --> 01:54.338
What is happening here?

01:54.341 --> 01:55.841
Ha-ha! I'm just
messing with you.

01:55.843 --> 01:57.509
Look. I palmed your
charm bracelet.

01:57.510 --> 01:59.978
There's an Allison charm,
a doctor charm...

01:59.979 --> 02:02.079
I thought you had ESP.

02:02.081 --> 02:04.448
I was gonna make you guess
what my job was.

02:04.450 --> 02:06.459
- You're unemployed.
- Well,

02:06.501 --> 02:08.318
actually I'm developing an app.

02:08.322 --> 02:09.388
- You get paid for that?
- Well,

02:09.389 --> 02:11.289
I'm talking to some investors.

02:11.292 --> 02:12.723
Yeah, you're unemployed.

02:13.578 --> 02:16.527
Dr. Allison,
it has been a pleasure.

02:17.260 --> 02:19.698
Take it sleazy,
Zuckerberg.

02:19.699 --> 02:22.000
Beard is ridiculous.

02:22.002 --> 02:23.467
Why?

02:23.468 --> 02:25.037
What the...?

02:25.038 --> 02:27.705
Uh... that woman just hit me.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.146
Ooh. Is Jill coming
to your party?

02:35.149 --> 02:37.748
Well, she's my best
friend, so yeah.

02:37.751 --> 02:40.752
- Cool. I won't bring a date.
- 'Cause you think

02:40.753 --> 02:43.288
- you're going home with her?
- Totally possible.

02:45.224 --> 02:47.558
Oh. Are you applying for the job
of her gay best friend?

02:47.561 --> 02:50.062
No. I'm applying for the job of
her lover, thank you very much,

02:50.063 --> 02:51.530
and my résumé's tight.

02:51.531 --> 02:52.798
Résumé? Hmm.

02:52.800 --> 02:53.998
"Allison's brother:

02:54.001 --> 02:55.766
"hobbies
include obsessive crushes

02:55.769 --> 02:58.002
and pooping my pants
on the way to Mammoth."

02:58.004 --> 03:00.906
Ooh. There was something wrong
with those date shakes.

03:00.907 --> 03:02.774
Look, Jill would be lucky
to go out with you,

03:02.776 --> 03:05.477
- I know.
- but I don't think she sees you that way,

03:05.479 --> 03:07.179
and I think you
should probably move on.

03:07.181 --> 03:08.513
- Never.
- I just worry about you,

03:08.514 --> 03:10.649
being newly divorced and all.

03:12.552 --> 03:16.921
- but I'm fine.
- Shut the front door! Dr. Allison!

03:16.924 --> 03:19.358
It's me, Amy,
from the farmers' market.

03:19.360 --> 03:22.127
How random is this,
running into you?

03:22.128 --> 03:23.728
It's really random.

03:23.730 --> 03:25.597
- Who's this Bit-O-Honey?
- Hi. What's up?

03:25.598 --> 03:28.366
- I'm Brad. I'm the brother.
- Mmm!

03:28.368 --> 03:30.168
- Yeah.
- Hey, I want to show you something.

03:30.170 --> 03:33.104
I got this thing on my shoulder,
might be a mole.

03:33.106 --> 03:34.605
Could be a...

03:34.608 --> 03:36.740
wax burn from some
degrading role play.

03:36.752 --> 03:37.985
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?

03:38.038 --> 03:39.115
Yeah, I do.

03:39.212 --> 03:41.780
So anyway, you give it an
eyeball, maybe ballpark diagnosis?

03:41.781 --> 03:43.581
Why don't you just
come into my office?

03:43.584 --> 03:45.783
- Just make an appointment.
- Oh. Okay. That's cool.

03:45.786 --> 03:49.086
Um, I am currently
in between insurance carriers,

03:49.088 --> 03:51.323
so what's your barter policy?

03:52.393 --> 03:54.325
Just messing with you!

03:54.328 --> 03:56.728
I'll pay cash.
It'll probably be all ones.

03:56.729 --> 03:58.396
And no,
I'm not a stripper, Brad.

03:58.399 --> 03:59.730
Damn it.

03:59.733 --> 04:01.032
So, Dr. Allison,

04:01.033 --> 04:02.768
I guess I'll be
seeing you soon, huh?

04:03.730 --> 04:04.802
And, you...

04:04.805 --> 04:06.504
I'm not done with you yet.

04:06.507 --> 04:09.206
Good. If you need me, I live
above my sister's garage.

04:09.209 --> 04:12.711
- Ooh, you're a project, aren't you?
- Get your tool set ready.

04:13.881 --> 04:15.747
Why was I flirting
with that woman?

04:15.748 --> 04:17.115
I have no idea.

04:17.117 --> 04:18.983
She's some kook
from the farmers' market.

04:18.985 --> 04:21.485
It's like she drew me in... it
got very sexual, very quickly.

04:21.487 --> 04:24.156
- Yeah, I know. It was weird.
- All right.

04:25.658 --> 04:27.192
♪ Ta-da! ♪

04:27.194 --> 04:29.494
- I told you I'd see you soon.
- Okay, uh,

04:29.495 --> 04:30.862
you keep showing up everywhere,

04:30.863 --> 04:32.697
- and it's freaking me out.
- Absolutely.

04:32.699 --> 04:35.132
It is weird. Creme de menthe?

04:35.134 --> 04:37.112
I'm actually on my way back to the office.

04:37.124 --> 04:39.670
'Cause it's 2:00 p.m.,
on a Tuesday.

04:39.673 --> 04:42.406
Wow, it's Tuesday already?
Man, space and time!

04:42.408 --> 04:45.110
- Listen, can I ask you something personal?
- I don't really know you.

04:45.112 --> 04:47.411
Do you believe there's a force in
this world that wants nothing more

04:47.413 --> 04:48.947
- than for you to be happy?
- But go ahead and ask anyway.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.012
And if there was

04:50.082 --> 04:52.884
such a force, do you think it
could be manifested in a person?

04:52.886 --> 04:56.790
A person whose mission is to safeguard
your journey through this world?

04:56.853 --> 05:00.257
You know, like, uh, intervene before you
get hit by a bus or something like that.

05:00.259 --> 05:02.326
It sounds like you're describing
a guardian angel.

05:02.329 --> 05:04.463
That's exactly
what I'm describing.

05:05.391 --> 05:06.964
What exactly do you want?

05:07.461 --> 05:08.766
Dr. Allison,

05:08.769 --> 05:10.836
we have not been
formally introduced.

05:11.692 --> 05:13.504
I'm Amy, and, honey...

05:14.192 --> 05:15.934
I'm your guardian angel.

05:16.709 --> 05:18.310
Uh... look...

05:18.762 --> 05:20.211
- I am a skin doctor.
- I know.

05:20.213 --> 05:22.247
I think what you need
is a psychiatrist.

05:22.249 --> 05:23.581
- Oh.
- Or...

05:23.584 --> 05:24.915
maybe a sober
living arrangement.

05:24.918 --> 05:28.119
Your mother died 412 days ago.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.221
And though you won't admit it,

05:30.223 --> 05:32.656
she was your best friend.

05:32.658 --> 05:35.593
And since then you've
buried yourself in work,

05:35.596 --> 05:36.927
buried yourself
in a relationship

05:36.930 --> 05:38.963
with a guy
who's a bit of a tool.

05:38.966 --> 05:40.031
- Hey...
- It's an observation,

05:40.033 --> 05:41.332
honey, it's not a judgment.

05:41.334 --> 05:42.800
Got your first period
at Red Lobster,

05:42.802 --> 05:44.034
which is super ironic.

05:44.036 --> 05:45.403
Stop!

05:45.404 --> 05:46.670
Remember your first orgasm,

05:46.673 --> 05:47.973
when you farted
just a little bit?

05:47.975 --> 05:49.374
Oh, my God!

05:49.375 --> 05:51.242
Oh, man, so embarrassing!

05:51.245 --> 05:53.144
How do you know all that stuff?

05:53.600 --> 05:55.180
I've been watching you.

05:55.182 --> 05:57.182
It's what we do.

05:57.183 --> 05:58.983
We watch over souls.

05:59.447 --> 06:01.843
And yours is amazing.

06:06.994 --> 06:08.425
You could've easily found
that stuff online.

06:08.427 --> 06:10.362
My friends over-share
on Facebook.

06:10.363 --> 06:11.930
That's true, and I am a whiz

06:11.932 --> 06:13.464
at the computer...
Especially Photoshop.

06:13.466 --> 06:14.899
Check this out... my head

06:14.901 --> 06:16.401
on Gisele Bundchen's body.

06:16.403 --> 06:17.869
- What do you think?
- Ew.

06:17.870 --> 06:19.504
Christmas card material? No?

06:19.505 --> 06:21.473
So you've been
cyber-stalking me?

06:21.475 --> 06:23.542
- I suppose you know my password?
- Maybe.

06:23.543 --> 06:27.177
Or... I may be an angel
whose mission it is to...

06:27.180 --> 06:29.613
safeguard your journey
through this world.

06:29.615 --> 06:31.182
It all depends

06:31.184 --> 06:32.983
on what you believe, Allison.

06:32.985 --> 06:34.752
Okay.

06:34.754 --> 06:38.255
See you later, angel lady. Yeah.
Okay.

06:38.257 --> 06:39.524
Look out!

06:39.526 --> 06:40.725
Bus! Oh, my God!

06:40.726 --> 06:42.127
No, no, no bus. I'm so sorry.

06:42.129 --> 06:43.528
I'm seeing things. My fault.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.163
- Okay.
- I'm sorry. No touching, either.

06:45.165 --> 06:47.331
I'm buzzed.
I thought I saw a bus.

06:47.334 --> 06:49.733
I'm loaded. It's the
creme de menthe, honey.

06:49.735 --> 06:50.911
It sneaks up on ya.

06:51.598 --> 06:53.129
S01E01
Pilot

06:53.159 --> 06:54.774
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

06:54.932 --> 06:57.375
- Morning, Felicia.
- Holy sunburn, Dad!

06:57.377 --> 06:59.377
How many days were you
lost in the desert?

06:59.379 --> 07:01.211
- I played a quick nine this morning.
- Aw, Dad,

07:01.213 --> 07:04.848
come on, we're dermatologists,
not cautionary tales.

07:04.850 --> 07:06.117
Hey, you know, I still
haven't received

07:06.119 --> 07:08.586
your RSVP
to the housewarming party.

07:08.588 --> 07:10.387
I think your house
is plenty warm.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.856
Is it really necessary to add
an unemployed boyfriend, honey?

07:12.858 --> 07:15.427
Evan and I are moving in
together, it is happening,

07:15.428 --> 07:16.795
and I want you there.

07:16.797 --> 07:18.228
Of course I'm coming.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.798
Great. Are you bringing anyone?

07:19.800 --> 07:21.065
No, no.

07:21.067 --> 07:23.766
Flying solo...
like a golden eagle.

07:23.882 --> 07:25.569
You know who you could bring?

07:25.572 --> 07:28.038
Uh, Dana from the club.
Yeah, she seems cool.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.108
- She's too short.
- Have you seen yourself lately?

07:30.110 --> 07:32.509
Exactly. If we had kids,
they'd be jockeys.

07:32.512 --> 07:35.312
Oh, what about that cute
pediatrician from the conference?

07:35.314 --> 07:37.281
Oh, I'll date a doctor
if you do.

07:37.283 --> 07:40.185
Dad, come on, it's been
over a year since Mom died.

07:40.187 --> 07:41.552
I'm not trying to pressure you.

07:41.555 --> 07:43.855
But it might be time
to get out there.

07:43.856 --> 07:45.255
Are you nervous?

07:45.257 --> 07:46.925
'Cause you're a Beverly
Hills skin doctor.

07:46.927 --> 07:48.393
There's going to be a stampede.

07:48.394 --> 07:50.362
Well, now
you're making me blush.

07:50.363 --> 07:52.930
I wish I could tell.
Stacy from the bank.

07:52.932 --> 07:55.132
And we're done.
If you'll excuse me now,

07:55.134 --> 07:57.769
I'm gonna go dunk my head
in some aloe.

07:58.838 --> 08:00.704
Sweet Volt. Evan's idea?

08:00.706 --> 08:02.574
You know what they
say about a guy

08:02.576 --> 08:05.276
with a small carbon
footprint... small penis.

08:05.278 --> 08:07.846
Okay, we're officially
in a stalker situation.

08:07.848 --> 08:10.180
Impromptu plan... you,
me, Julio's Cantina.

08:10.182 --> 08:12.442
When's the last time you had a
weekday margarita?

08:12.528 --> 08:13.024
No, thanks.

08:13.086 --> 08:15.387
I've got a 6:00 a.m. spin class.

08:15.389 --> 08:17.822
Plus, I'm off sugar.

08:20.226 --> 08:22.593
I have an antihistamine
or EpiPen here somewhere,

08:22.596 --> 08:25.651
- 'Cause I'm allergic to fun.
- Because you're allergic to fun.

08:27.783 --> 08:29.968
Listen... I know we just met

08:29.970 --> 08:32.635
and we're having a great time
making jokes, but...

08:32.639 --> 08:36.385
I have something really intense
I need to talk to you about.

08:39.510 --> 08:41.245
I have cancer.

08:42.682 --> 08:45.182
Okay, I don't have cancer.

08:45.750 --> 08:47.184
Terrible lie.

08:48.251 --> 08:51.022
- Never should've said it.
- You just faked cancer?

08:51.024 --> 08:53.024
Let's leave the past
in the past, okay?

08:53.025 --> 08:55.326
I didn't know any other way
to get you here.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.195
Oh, so you had to lie?

08:57.197 --> 08:59.264
Technically, we're never
supposed to intervene

08:59.265 --> 09:00.764
in a human's life.

09:00.767 --> 09:02.366
Oh, is that some sort
of angel rule?

09:02.369 --> 09:04.201
As a matter of fact, it is, yes.

09:04.203 --> 09:07.706
We're supposed to help from
afar, be subtle about things.

09:07.707 --> 09:10.908
You know, like implant
an inspirational thought,

09:10.910 --> 09:12.610
or nudge you
towards the conditioner

09:12.611 --> 09:15.013
that would give your hair
that perfect bounce.

09:15.014 --> 09:17.916
- The Pantene?
- You're welcome.

09:17.918 --> 09:20.350
But if I see
you're about to go down

09:20.352 --> 09:22.287
a dangerous path,
what am I gonna do,

09:22.288 --> 09:23.654
stick my head up my ass?

09:23.657 --> 09:25.724
What are you talking about,
"dangerous path"?

09:27.527 --> 09:29.293
Follow me.

09:29.296 --> 09:31.328
Oh.

09:31.331 --> 09:32.897
I didn't know they
were having dinner tonight.

09:32.899 --> 09:34.331
Evan said he was working.

09:34.334 --> 09:37.335
He's working on boning
your best friend.

09:37.336 --> 09:39.104
They've hooked up once before.

09:39.105 --> 09:41.605
Some light petting...
I won't go into details.

09:41.607 --> 09:43.875
- Second base.
- What?!

09:43.876 --> 09:45.876
Boobs, dude.

09:45.879 --> 09:47.979
And some dry humping,
but please, I just,

09:47.980 --> 09:50.215
I don't want to get
into the details.

09:50.216 --> 09:52.917
I'm sorry, Evan is cheating?

09:52.918 --> 09:54.219
With Jill?

09:54.221 --> 09:55.653
Kid, I'm so sorry.

09:55.654 --> 09:57.087
Oh, honey.

09:57.090 --> 09:58.822
Would it cheer you up
to know that there is

09:58.825 --> 10:01.158
a taquito...

10:01.160 --> 10:02.760
behind your ear?

10:08.802 --> 10:10.969
These are surprisingly crunchy.

10:16.841 --> 10:17.873
Hey, guys.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.674
- Oh. Hey, babe.
- Hi.

10:19.677 --> 10:22.010
Wha... What are you doing here?
I thought you were working late.

10:22.013 --> 10:23.645
Oh, I just...

10:23.648 --> 10:24.580
you know...

10:24.581 --> 10:26.548
What are you doing here?

10:26.549 --> 10:27.750
Um...

10:28.818 --> 10:31.186
I guess you caught us.

10:31.984 --> 10:33.389
I can't believe this.

10:33.390 --> 10:35.024
How could you?

10:35.025 --> 10:36.392
How could I what?

10:36.394 --> 10:38.460
And, Jill, you're hooking up
with my boyfriend?

10:38.461 --> 10:40.296
Allison,
wh-what are you talking about?

10:40.298 --> 10:41.429
We didn't hook up.

10:41.432 --> 10:42.463
Oh, then what the hell is this?

10:42.466 --> 10:44.536
With the coffee and the cakes?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.534
Babe, there's just one cake.

10:46.537 --> 10:47.735
Look...

10:47.738 --> 10:48.736
I wasn't going to tell you,

10:48.739 --> 10:49.804
but I'm-I'm making a video

10:49.807 --> 10:51.072
for the party tomorrow night,

10:51.075 --> 10:53.075
of all the big moments
in your life.

10:53.076 --> 10:54.976
Because moving in together

10:54.979 --> 10:56.778
is the biggest moment
in my life.

10:56.780 --> 10:59.948
- Yeah?
- And Jill was just helping me out.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.283
She just brought over pics

11:01.284 --> 11:02.317
that I can scan.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.379
This is us at prom.

11:04.421 --> 11:06.522
This was when we were in Greece.

11:06.524 --> 11:08.557
Oh, and one of us
at Red Lobster.

11:08.558 --> 11:10.926
It's a little weird you have
a picture from that day.

11:10.927 --> 11:11.994
It was a big moment.

11:11.995 --> 11:13.261
It's really sweet.

11:13.264 --> 11:14.562
Oh, my God, you guys.
I'm so sorry.

11:14.565 --> 11:15.898
I just totally freaked out.

11:15.899 --> 11:17.765
Can we please just forget
I said anything?

11:17.768 --> 11:20.068
- Um, yeah.
- I'm so sorry.

11:20.071 --> 11:22.303
Babe, why would
you even think that?

11:22.306 --> 11:25.110
- I don't know. I'm sorry.
- Ah, come here.

11:28.812 --> 11:31.413
He's lying. I know
they were hooking up.

11:31.414 --> 11:32.780
- How?
- An angel knows.

11:32.783 --> 11:34.649
- And I hacked into his e-mails.
- What?!

11:34.652 --> 11:37.019
- I told you I'm a wiz at the computer.
- Ugh!

11:37.020 --> 11:39.888
Oh, please, no, stop. Please.

11:39.889 --> 11:41.756
Let me explain.

11:41.759 --> 11:43.392
- Are you crying?
- No.

11:43.394 --> 11:45.193
There's habanero pepper
in this taquito

11:45.196 --> 11:47.696
and I'm literally
digesting lava.

11:47.697 --> 11:49.498
I want you out of my life.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.299
Seriously.
I will get a restraining order.

11:51.302 --> 11:52.500
My uncle's a lawyer.

11:52.503 --> 11:53.769
Your uncle's a dentist.

11:53.770 --> 11:55.037
Why do you know everything?

11:55.038 --> 11:56.638
I am going back inside
to have dinner

11:56.639 --> 11:58.440
with my non-cheating boyfriend
and my best friend.

11:58.442 --> 12:00.542
Crazy ladies not invited.

12:00.543 --> 12:03.177
Well, I'm not following you,
but I got to go to the bathroom.

12:03.179 --> 12:06.715
I've got a nuclear situation
here and it ain't a drill.

12:06.716 --> 12:08.149
Hi.

12:08.152 --> 12:09.918
You look gorgeous.

12:09.919 --> 12:12.287
So good to see you.

12:12.288 --> 12:14.590
Hello. Hey, you.

12:14.591 --> 12:16.024
Hi, Brad.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.091
How's the cleanse going?

12:17.094 --> 12:18.594
Oh, I stopped it last week.

12:18.596 --> 12:19.995
Didn't I tell you?

12:20.831 --> 12:22.163
You did not.

12:22.166 --> 12:23.731
Spacey actress.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.101
Anyway, how is it going for you?

12:27.104 --> 12:29.238
Uh, good for me.
I'm-I'm-I'm loving it. Yeah.

12:29.240 --> 12:31.306
I've had some vertigo
and full body sweats,

12:31.307 --> 12:32.740
but other than...

12:32.743 --> 12:34.409
and I am a little weak,
actually, but good.

12:34.412 --> 12:36.912
- Cool.
- So, um...

12:36.913 --> 12:38.580
Yeah, I'm loving
the clean living.

12:38.581 --> 12:40.481
- It's going to be my thing now.
- Do you want to get drunk?

12:40.484 --> 12:42.518
- Absolutely.
- Come on.

12:44.000 --> 12:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:53.630 --> 12:55.630
Man, I got to stop intervening.

12:55.633 --> 12:57.165
Are you talking to me?

12:57.168 --> 12:58.366
Evan's cheating on Allison,

12:58.369 --> 12:59.934
and I just want to go in there

12:59.937 --> 13:01.803
and bust him, but I can't.

13:01.806 --> 13:04.139
I'm trying to be
more disciplined.

13:04.140 --> 13:06.075
Okay, I don't know any of the
people you're talking about.

13:06.076 --> 13:08.043
What? Boo. Bad neighbor.

13:08.044 --> 13:09.344
- All right.
- Get out of here.

13:09.346 --> 13:11.379
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Hey, don't let him

13:11.381 --> 13:12.780
take a whizz on my chariot.

13:12.783 --> 13:14.883
It's my only mode
of transport post DWI.

13:14.884 --> 13:16.985
Speaking of which, do you
know a good attorney?

13:16.986 --> 13:18.486
Like, an affordable guy,

13:18.489 --> 13:20.221
someone who's not going
to ask a lot of questions?

13:20.224 --> 13:21.222
Have a nice night.

13:21.225 --> 13:22.624
You, too, pal.

13:22.625 --> 13:24.493
Hey, and introduce yourself
to Allison!

13:24.495 --> 13:27.562
She's the best!

13:31.110 --> 13:33.677
Welcome, everybody,
to our first party.

13:36.121 --> 13:37.789
I'll keep it short. Um...

13:37.831 --> 13:41.253
I just want to say
how truly lucky I feel

13:41.352 --> 13:42.652
to have met this man.

13:42.653 --> 13:44.153
- Aw...
- He makes me feel

13:44.155 --> 13:45.788
safe and loved

13:45.790 --> 13:48.692
and I'm so happy
we're living together.

13:48.693 --> 13:50.994
No, I'm the lucky one
to have you.

13:50.995 --> 13:52.361
Hear, hear!

13:52.364 --> 13:54.697
- I'm pretty great.
- Yes, you are.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.665
- We're out of beer.
- We're out of beer.

13:56.668 --> 13:58.000
Get some more beer.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.302
Love is in the air, huh?

14:02.774 --> 14:04.274
Oh, sorry, yeah.

14:04.275 --> 14:06.342
I need two cases of
Anchor Steam delivered to...

14:06.345 --> 14:08.245
Weird.

14:08.246 --> 14:10.013
Uh, no, not you. No.

14:10.014 --> 14:12.548
Two cases of Anchor Steam
delivered to...

14:12.551 --> 14:14.683
My clover charm?

14:19.892 --> 14:22.225
Weird.

14:22.226 --> 14:24.693
Hey.

14:24.696 --> 14:27.764
Hi. Hey, are you missing
your clover charm?

14:27.765 --> 14:29.365
The one we got in Ireland?

14:30.201 --> 14:32.269
Yeah. How'd you know?

14:32.911 --> 14:35.038
Because it was in Evan's office.

14:35.759 --> 14:37.506
On his couch.

14:41.230 --> 14:42.412
Evan and I hooked up.

14:43.915 --> 14:45.182
God, I'm so sorry.

14:45.183 --> 14:46.615
- What?
- What?!

14:46.618 --> 14:48.717
It happened when we
were making the video.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.787
Things got out of hand. I promise
it'll never happen again.

14:50.788 --> 14:53.056
- Seriously?
- Seriously?!

14:53.057 --> 14:54.758
Not your moment, Brad.

14:54.759 --> 14:57.259
- Are you kidding me?
- Are you kidding me?

14:57.261 --> 14:58.495
No-no-no. I-I...

14:58.496 --> 15:00.330
- We did not hook up.
- Oh?

15:00.331 --> 15:01.764
Okay, I did, but...

15:01.767 --> 15:03.700
just give me one minute
to explain.

15:03.701 --> 15:05.134
Which part?

15:05.136 --> 15:07.169
The cheating or
the-the making me feel horrible

15:07.172 --> 15:09.605
for accusing you of cheating
while you were cheating?

15:10.296 --> 15:13.176
All right, this move-in has brought
up a lot of issues for me.

15:13.177 --> 15:15.077
- What issues?
- Okay, uh, well, uh,

15:15.080 --> 15:17.179
first of all, uh,
we're very different people.

15:17.182 --> 15:18.914
- Oh, okay.
- 'Cause I'm super chill

15:18.917 --> 15:21.451
- Mm.
- but you, you're so intense.

15:21.452 --> 15:23.419
Plus you're always on the phone
or you're at the office.

15:23.422 --> 15:26.288
You have literally worked
about every weekend

15:26.291 --> 15:27.657
since we have been together.

15:27.658 --> 15:29.292
Well, somebody's got to work
around here.

15:29.293 --> 15:30.927
Oh.

15:30.928 --> 15:32.394
So there it is.

15:32.397 --> 15:34.163
You don't believe
in my business plan.

15:34.165 --> 15:35.966
An app where you can choose
different skin colors

15:35.967 --> 15:37.200
for your photos?

15:37.201 --> 15:39.168
Uh, it's like Benetton.

15:39.171 --> 15:40.903
Okay, it promotes tolerance.

15:40.905 --> 15:42.538
It promotes blackface.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.807
No, it-it doesn't. It...

15:44.809 --> 15:47.476
Okay, we're just gonna need
to cool things off here

15:47.479 --> 15:49.446
before someone says something
they're going to regret.

15:49.447 --> 15:50.647
Oh, okay, well, how about this?

15:50.649 --> 15:52.682
How about leave
and never come back?

15:53.238 --> 15:54.783
I'm serious. Go.

15:54.786 --> 15:56.546
I'm going to go.

15:56.841 --> 15:58.822
- That's what I said.
- Yeah.

15:58.823 --> 16:00.823
And then I said it.

16:02.383 --> 16:03.759
Oh, my God.

16:03.761 --> 16:06.495
Uh, yeah, hi. Uh, everybody,

16:06.498 --> 16:09.065
the, um, party celebrating
my relationship

16:09.067 --> 16:11.934
ended when my relationship
ended.

16:11.937 --> 16:13.636
You heard her, folks!
Move it or lose it!

16:13.639 --> 16:14.865
Wow.

16:16.107 --> 16:18.389
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

16:19.177 --> 16:21.076
Oh, kiddo.

16:21.078 --> 16:23.679
I heard he was cheating and
I didn't want to believe it.

16:23.682 --> 16:26.283
You deserve so much
better than him.

16:26.284 --> 16:28.384
- Thanks, Dad.
- Love you, kiddo.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.168
♪ Ta-da! ♪

16:47.405 --> 16:48.804
So creepy.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.373
I was just going
to leave the plate,

16:50.375 --> 16:52.471
but I thought, "Who eats
unattended camp food, huh"

16:52.476 --> 16:55.345
FYI, best s'more ever.

16:55.346 --> 16:57.413
Well, here it is
on a Sunday morning

16:57.415 --> 16:59.014
and the doctor is in.

16:59.017 --> 17:02.619
My diagnosis: nerdialence.

17:02.620 --> 17:05.721
Look, I don't know how you knew

17:05.723 --> 17:07.656
but you knew.

17:07.659 --> 17:09.223
Evan and Jill were hooking up.

17:09.227 --> 17:11.560
You were right, go ahead,
throw it in my face.

17:11.563 --> 17:12.962
Aw, sorry, kid.

17:12.964 --> 17:15.097
That must feel terrible.

17:15.698 --> 17:17.017
It does.

17:18.002 --> 17:19.435
Here, take a bite.

17:22.030 --> 17:22.823
Nobody's made me s'mores

17:22.939 --> 17:23.920
- since I was a kid...
- Since you were a little girl.

17:23.942 --> 17:26.241
- Your mom used to make them for you.
- Yeah, my mom used to...

17:26.242 --> 17:27.644
- She used to make them for me whenever I
- She used to make them for you...

17:27.645 --> 17:28.785
Okay, can I please finish
a nostalgic thought.

17:28.890 --> 17:29.692
Sure.

17:30.071 --> 17:32.615
She... used to make them

17:32.616 --> 17:34.416
for me just because.

17:34.419 --> 17:35.684
Mm.

17:35.686 --> 17:38.020
She called it my reward
for being me.

17:38.022 --> 17:41.257
She'd surprise me with
a plate every few months.

17:41.259 --> 17:43.192
That's why I made the s'more.

17:43.194 --> 17:46.128
I wanted to remind you of a time
when you felt really loved.

17:46.131 --> 17:48.897
Well... that is not
how I feel now.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.300
Pity party, your table's ready.

17:51.302 --> 17:52.868
What? I barely got choked up.

17:52.871 --> 17:54.203
Do you know what
your problem is?

17:54.205 --> 17:56.239
You take care of
everybody but yourself,

17:56.240 --> 17:58.173
and that attracts people
who take advantage.

17:58.175 --> 18:00.175
I mean, you basically
supported your boyfriend,

18:00.178 --> 18:02.378
your let your brother
sleep in your garage.

18:02.381 --> 18:03.579
What is your point?

18:03.582 --> 18:05.882
Living for others
never end well.

18:05.884 --> 18:07.517
It drains you, honey.

18:07.519 --> 18:09.752
Now, take a bite.

18:10.821 --> 18:12.689
Hmm?

18:17.442 --> 18:18.094
Wow.

18:19.498 --> 18:20.763
That's amazing.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.198
Look at that smile, huh?

18:22.200 --> 18:24.733
That's the smile of
a happy kid, huh?

18:24.736 --> 18:26.201
Living in the moment,

18:26.203 --> 18:27.936
free from everybody's
expectations.

18:27.939 --> 18:29.338
Settle down.

18:29.340 --> 18:30.573
Personal space.

18:30.575 --> 18:32.674
Oh, Allison, I could help you.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.009
You just need somebody
to nudge you,

18:34.011 --> 18:35.444
to say, get off the phone,

18:35.447 --> 18:37.614
have a weekday margarita,
have some fun,

18:37.615 --> 18:40.650
let some random guy
take you to O-town.

18:40.652 --> 18:42.719
Oh, I was with you
right up until the end.

18:42.721 --> 18:45.188
Ah, you don't just
deserve to be happy

18:45.190 --> 18:47.123
and to be loved.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.125
It's your birthright.

18:49.126 --> 18:51.962
And I want nothing less for you.

18:52.375 --> 18:54.263
You might even say...

18:54.266 --> 18:56.566
it's my mission in life.

18:56.567 --> 18:58.567
But...

18:58.569 --> 19:01.570
if all this angel stuff is too
bizarre for you, I understand,

19:01.573 --> 19:04.807
I get it...
and I'll leave you alone.

19:09.480 --> 19:11.381
Walk very slowly...

19:11.383 --> 19:15.050
just in case she wants
to change her mind.

19:23.261 --> 19:26.528
It's not that I believe
you're an angel.

19:26.530 --> 19:28.565
- But...?
- But...

19:30.234 --> 19:33.903
you know, I could use
a weird friend.

19:33.904 --> 19:35.204
Look at me.

19:35.207 --> 19:36.940
Yeah, I know.

19:36.942 --> 19:38.708
Do they come any weirder?

19:38.710 --> 19:40.175
You got coffee in there?

19:40.177 --> 19:41.478
I do.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.512
Crème de menthe.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.147
Mm, shocker.

19:45.150 --> 19:47.851
Let's get our Sunday on, huh?

20:37.365 --> 20:38.766
What?
