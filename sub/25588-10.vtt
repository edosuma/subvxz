Friends, Romans, fourth graders,
lend me your ears!

00:18.268 --> 00:20.270
You're about to visit Romeinaday,

00:20.353 --> 00:24.315
Piqua's second most authentic
ancient Rome reenactment experience!

00:24.399 --> 00:26.901
I am Keithicus, head of visitor relations,

00:26.985 --> 00:29.779
here to help you
make the most of your upcoming field trip!

00:29.863 --> 00:32.782
- Please. Ask me anything.
- What kind of rides are there?

00:32.991 --> 00:34.367
There are no rides.

00:34.451 --> 00:37.829
But there are bowls, vases,
other ceramics.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.765
Was this what you wanted to do
when you grew up?

00:39.789 --> 00:40.832
[stutters] What?

00:40.915 --> 00:42.542
Uh... [clears throat]

00:42.625 --> 00:46.379
No, I mean, actually, I was in a band.
Local Trout and Kenny.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.548
- But it didn't work out.
- [CD case shattering]

00:48.631 --> 00:52.343
Anyway, let's talk about papyrus
or Roman paper.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.863
- [Harold] What went wrong?
- [sighs]

00:53.887 --> 00:56.056
- My band broke up and that was that.
- Cool.

00:56.306 --> 00:59.642
- So, you'll also make your own bowl.
- [George] Why'd you guys break up?

00:59.726 --> 01:02.520
Was it creative differences
or a personality clash?

01:02.604 --> 01:06.024
Kenny the drummer
stole my girlfriend, okay? So not cool!

01:06.232 --> 01:09.110
Ruined our lives! There! Happy?

- [narrator] <i>True.</i>

I, Julius Caesar,
find you most vexing, Rippedicus!

02:20.974 --> 02:24.269
You have bested Roboticles,
my robot gladiator,

02:24.352 --> 02:27.021

02:27.230 --> 02:32.694

[shouts]

02:41.411 --> 02:43.454
Being a gladiator was so awesome.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.748
- I wanna be Rippedicus.
- I want a mega-motor-chariot.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.459
You realize not a single thing
in this show is true, right?

02:48.543 --> 02:51.671
Uh, sure, it is! They wouldn't put it
in the show if it wasn't true.

02:51.754 --> 02:55.300

and the Corrupt Cruelius Sneezer,</i>

03:00.179 --> 03:01.532

03:01.556 --> 03:04.309
<i>So one day, Captain Underpants
was at a pizza place called</i>

03:04.392 --> 03:06.060
<i>"Go Big Or Go Rome Pizza,"</i>

03:06.144 --> 03:08.062
<i>and he went to the bathroom
to wash his hands.</i>

03:08.146 --> 03:11.024
<i>His locket with a picture of his dad
fell into the toilet,</i>

03:11.107 --> 03:15.320
<i>and he was all like, "Dad!"</i>

03:15.403 --> 03:16.321
<i>And he dove in after it.</i>

03:16.404 --> 03:20.158
<i>But it was a time toilet
so he got transported to ancient Rome.</i>

03:20.241 --> 03:23.995
<i>So he flew around Rome on locket lookout
lifting up buildings... </i> [grunts]

03:24.078 --> 03:27.206
<i>And was all, "Dad, stay where you are!
I'll find you!" </i> [groans]

03:27.290 --> 03:31.961
<i>And Emperor Julius Caesar was riding by
on one of those couches on sticks</i>

03:32.045 --> 03:35.882
<i>and was all, "You're jacked, yo!
Be my best new gladiator!"</i>

03:35.965 --> 03:38.925
<i>But Captain Underpants was like,
"No, thanks. I'm a napper, not a fighter."</i>

03:38.968 --> 03:41.346
<i>And fell asleep standing up to prove it
and was all,</i>

03:41.429 --> 03:45.850
<i>"Honkshoo, honkshoo.
Hi, dream wafflebats! Honkshoo!"</i>

03:45.934 --> 03:50.521
<i>Caesar was so mad he fell off his couch
into a cauldron of five-alarm Roman chili</i>

03:50.605 --> 03:53.191
<i>some chariot tailgaters
were making in the parking lot.</i>

03:53.274 --> 03:54.442
<i>And the chili was so spicy,</i>

03:54.525 --> 03:58.821
<i>it turned Julius Caesar into
the nosemonster Cruelius Sneezer! Roar!</i>

03:58.905 --> 04:01.741
<i>The sound of a guy becoming a nose
woke Captain Underpants up,</i>

04:01.824 --> 04:05.036
<i>and Cruelius Sneezer was all,
"No one says no to the nose!"</i>

04:05.119 --> 04:09.332
<i>And he fired an actual snot rocket
at Captain Underpants 'cause snot rocket.</i>

04:09.415 --> 04:11.834
<i>And Captain Underpants
punched the rocket into space.</i>

04:11.918 --> 04:14.504
<i>And that was the beginning
of the space program.</i>

04:14.587 --> 04:15.587
<i>But that's unrelated!</i>

04:15.630 --> 04:17.589
<i>But Cruelius Sneezer
had more tricks up his nose!</i>

04:17.673 --> 04:18.882
<i>Like card tricks,</i>

04:18.966 --> 04:21.844
<i>and the one where you cut the lady
into half with the saw, saw, saw.</i>

04:21.928 --> 04:23.530
<i>But after the show,
Captain Underpants was all,</i>

04:23.554 --> 04:25.807
<i>"I gotta stop this nose
from starting a space race!"</i>

04:25.890 --> 04:29.269
<i>So he shoved all the undies he had
into Sneezer's schnoz.</i>

04:29.352 --> 04:31.396
<i>And Sneezer was like,
"I can't breathe, I give up."</i>

04:31.479 --> 04:34.357
<i>So they made peace
and ate five-alarm Roman chili.</i>

04:34.440 --> 04:36.776
<i>And when Captain Underpants
found his locket in his bowl,</i>

04:36.859 --> 04:41.406
<i>he wept 'cause he loved his dad
but also the chili was spicy!</i>

04:41.489 --> 04:42.782
<i>Awoogah times five!</i>

04:42.865 --> 04:45.636
<i>And then he was like, "Do you guys know
where I can find a time toilet?"</i>

04:45.660 --> 04:48.329
<i>And the Romans were like,
"What's a toilet?" Oh, no, the end.</i>

04:48.746 --> 04:52.709
- Morning, roboboss! Bear claw?
- What do you want, you loose tooth?

04:52.792 --> 04:55.712
To chaperone the Romeinaday trip?

04:55.795 --> 04:58.798
Fine, if you leave now, without a word.

05:01.426 --> 05:04.679
[squelches]

05:04.762 --> 05:06.723
You know what would be
an awesome field trip?

05:06.806 --> 05:09.600
Real ancient Rome. We could be gladiators!

05:09.684 --> 05:13.438
Yeah, but instead we gotta go
to fake ancient Rome and make bowls.

05:13.521 --> 05:14.707
[narrator] <i>And other ceramics.</i>

05:14.731 --> 05:16.399
- Unless...
- Unless what?

05:16.482 --> 05:21.195
Unless someone made a time machine
big enough for the whole class.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.741
Melvin, let us in your
rubber recess bubble.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.410

- [squeaking]

05:34.042 --> 05:36.586
[narrator] <i>George and Harold knew
Melvin's top weak spots.</i>

05:36.669 --> 05:40.006
<i>Snakes, physical exertion and his ego.</i>

05:40.089 --> 05:44.886
Well, ol' Harold and I were just talking
and he was saying how amazing it is

05:44.969 --> 05:46.971
that you invented a compact time machine.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.307
What? Uh, er, yes. I said that.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.767
Go on. Scone?

05:50.975 --> 05:54.854
But then he wondered if you had the chops
to build a bigger time machine.

05:54.937 --> 05:55.813
Yeah. Uh-huh.

05:55.897 --> 05:56.939
Of course I do!

05:57.023 --> 05:59.442
That's what I said to Harold.
And he agreed.

05:59.525 --> 06:03.988
But then we decided there's no way
it could be big enough for our whole class

06:04.072 --> 06:05.990
even if you made it
out of our field trip bus.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.826
- Um, yeah.
- Yes, it could and I can!

06:08.910 --> 06:10.912
I'll have a prototype in two weeks!

06:10.995 --> 06:15.124
Harold, weren't you saying a real inventor
could knock it out in a day or less?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.919
Yes. I am a real taskmaster.

06:18.002 --> 06:20.379
- I'll have it tomorrow! Now get out!
- [both groan]

06:23.800 --> 06:25.927
[engine sputters]

06:26.010 --> 06:29.013

- [car door opening]

06:29.097 --> 06:30.306
- Car trouble?
- [yelps]

06:30.389 --> 06:34.560
- Is that my car battery?
- Yep. So, when people visit Romeinaday,

06:34.644 --> 06:37.271
I hear you make one of them
emperor for the day.

06:37.563 --> 06:40.900
Uh, yeah, we pick one of the kids.

06:41.109 --> 06:44.278
Not tomorrow.
Tomorrow, you're gonna pick me.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.072
What? Why?

06:46.155 --> 06:50.201
All the emperor gets is, like,
a free small frozen yogurt.

06:50.284 --> 06:55.456
Yes, but they also get to taste
absolute power!

06:55.832 --> 06:58.167
Set. [laughs]

06:58.251 --> 06:59.544
- Oh, yeah.
- [knuckles crack]

06:59.627 --> 07:02.880
Uh, no absolute power. Just the yogurt.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.633
- Do you want your car to start again?
- I-I mean, yeah.

07:05.883 --> 07:08.511
- Then we have a deal.
- What?

07:08.594 --> 07:12.432
Hey, you gotta put my battery back, man!

07:12.515 --> 07:16.936
I'm a breaker, not a fixer! [cackles]

07:51.596 --> 07:55.308

Why do I exist?

- [rock music playing]
- That's easy. You're lunch!

- What's with the boat?
- Mouthbreathers!

08:08.446 --> 08:12.909
This is no mere boat.
Behold, the TimeTanic 2000!

08:12.992 --> 08:13.910
[foghorn blares]

08:13.993 --> 08:17.246
You named your time machine after a ship
that hit an iceberg and sank?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.600
The name made a lot more sense
at 3:00 in the morning.

08:19.624 --> 08:22.418
And it still does, because it's brilliant.

08:22.502 --> 08:27.381

Don't let the dog-cat eat me. [snores]

08:27.465 --> 08:29.133

08:29.217 --> 08:31.761
Well, I guess we're taking
a boat to Romeinaday!

08:32.053 --> 08:33.763
All aboard, kids!

08:34.931 --> 08:37.642

of all the red flags in this situation.

- [snores]
- [both] Melvin!

08:44.232 --> 08:45.358
[screams, shudders]

08:45.441 --> 08:48.611
George was just saying
this might just be a normal boat-bus

08:48.694 --> 08:50.988
- and not a time machine.
- Yes. I said that.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.449
Just your average
run-of-the-mill boat-bus.

08:53.533 --> 08:57.662
Absurd! Would a normal boat-bus
have a time machine remote control?

08:57.745 --> 08:58.788
That's what I said!

08:58.871 --> 09:02.625
But then George said you probably
can't even pick a specific time and place.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.252
- Like ancient Rome.
- [beeps]

09:04.335 --> 09:06.254
I just set it for ancient Rome!

09:06.337 --> 09:07.922
That's what I said you'd do!

09:08.005 --> 09:10.800
But then George said
you'd never have the guts to use it.

09:10.883 --> 09:15.263
- Those were my words. In that order.
- You want guts? Get a taste of these guts!

- [laughs]
- Whoa.

09:31.654 --> 09:35.074
- Ancient Rome looks so real!
- Because it is real!

09:35.157 --> 09:38.286
- What have you rusty harmonicas done?
- Nothing. You pushed the button.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.787
You manipulated me!

09:39.870 --> 09:42.540
Even though that's impossible
because your minds are inferior.

09:42.623 --> 09:47.044
So you can't, but you did.
I'm having it both ways!

09:47.128 --> 09:50.172
Hey, cheer up!
Thanks to you, we can all be gladiators!

09:50.464 --> 09:53.759
So, how do we do that?
I want my mega-motor-chariot!

09:53.843 --> 09:56.971
<i>You are a gladiator
because you broke the rules, Rippedicus.</i>

09:57.179 --> 10:00.016
That's because the rules
don't apply to me.

[grunting]

10:03.561 --> 10:05.021
[Rippedicus laughs]

10:05.271 --> 10:08.316
Why did that wall explode?
That doesn't make any sense.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.610
You're getting cell service
in ancient Rome?

10:10.693 --> 10:14.614
Whatever. So all we gotta do
to become gladiators is break a rule.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.574
And I know just the rule to break.

10:16.907 --> 10:20.745
"Kneel before Julius Caesar"?
Man, real Caesar is a jerk, too.

10:20.828 --> 10:23.664
Stop! This is ancient Rome,
you undercooked eggs!

No, the shiny thing on that nose!

20:23.388 --> 20:26.058
Whoa! That is one serious nose.

20:26.141 --> 20:29.144
You want nose? Get a taste of this nose!

Time to go. [chuckles] Field trip's over.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.579
Good. 'Cause I am Romed out.

20:47.663 --> 20:50.332
Melvin, you got until we reach
the TimeTanic to do your thing!

20:50.540 --> 20:52.376
George, how do we get there fast?

20:52.918 --> 20:55.254
It's no mega-motor-chariot,

21:16.566 --> 21:18.610
You gotta make a note

21:18.694 --> 21:20.028
It's just common sense.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.323
