WEBVTT

00:52.420 --> 00:54.686
- Fuck. Get off of me!

00:54.688 --> 00:56.188
Fucking pigs, get off of me!
- What's happening?

00:56.190 --> 00:57.823
- Found him walking in
the middle of the street.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.458
Then he just starts
going ape shit.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.794
- Put your hands behind
your back, cuffs!

01:01.796 --> 01:05.330
- I've got it.
- Get the fuck off!

01:05.331 --> 01:06.665
Fuckers!

01:06.667 --> 01:07.666
Mother...

01:11.138 --> 01:13.806
- For fuck sake!

01:13.808 --> 01:16.275
Calm down, sir, calm down.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.709
- Get the fuck off of me!

01:21.715 --> 01:23.315
You're not taking
me, you're with them!

01:23.317 --> 01:24.683
-Sir!

01:24.685 --> 01:26.785
- You okay, Sarge?
- Yeah, I got this.

01:26.787 --> 01:29.621
- Back off, fuck off!

01:29.623 --> 01:32.157
- Sir, please calm
down, we just wanna help.

01:32.159 --> 01:34.326
- Why don't you
just leave me alone?

01:34.328 --> 01:36.628
- Just stay calm and we
can sort all of this out

01:36.630 --> 01:40.199
and get you whatever
help you need, okay?

01:40.201 --> 01:41.633
What's your name?

01:41.635 --> 01:43.302
- Freddie.

01:43.304 --> 01:46.371
- Okay, Freddie, PC
Mathews is gonna take you

01:46.373 --> 01:49.241
to an interview room
and get you a coffee.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.777
Just stay calm, I promise
you everything will be okay.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.565
- You sure you're okay?

02:14.768 --> 02:17.803
Look, just ignore Mathews,
he can be a bit of a dick.

02:17.805 --> 02:21.240
- I'm fine, it's not that
he just doesn't like a woman

02:21.242 --> 02:23.408
outranking him, he's
an old sweat, I get it.

02:23.410 --> 02:26.311
I'm just pissed off that
I fucked up in there.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.847
I should've secured that cuff.
- We all fuck up.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.750
You put it right,
that's all that matters.

02:31.752 --> 02:35.287
- Is there a unit free
that can deal with a suicide?

02:35.289 --> 02:38.657
- I'll take this one, I need
to get outta here for a bit.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.925
- Whiskey Zulu
Two Zero to comms.

02:39.927 --> 02:42.761
I'll take this one, go ahead.
- Thanks, Sarge.

02:42.763 --> 02:46.832
We have a report of a
suicide at Lifton Path.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.701
Caller is a Mrs. Peters,
the deceased's wife.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.837
Are you okay to check this
out in the first instant?

02:51.839 --> 02:52.905
- ARVs?

02:53.841 --> 02:56.708
- Are there any
ARVs able to assist?

02:56.710 --> 02:58.944
- Let me check, Sarge.

02:58.946 --> 03:02.447
No, they're all committed, but
I'll get one to the station

03:02.449 --> 03:05.651
to collect the shotgun as
soon as one becomes available.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.436
Best I can do.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.220
- It's gonna take 'em hours
to get here from the city.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.458
- Can you give me
an ETA on the ARV?

03:14.562 --> 03:16.228
- Negative,
we're unable to--

03:22.670 --> 03:24.469
- Whiskey Zulu Two Zero
to comms, come in, please?

03:25.973 --> 03:28.874
Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to
comms, can you hear me?

03:30.427 --> 03:31.977
- It's fine, happens
a lot out here.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.981
- Whiskey Zulu Eight
Six, can you read me?

03:36.784 --> 03:38.750
We can still use the channel.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.886
It's just comms that've
got the problem.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.721
I'm sure they'll
be back on soon.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.957
- Well, I will keep
trying comms en route.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.725
Just make sure you
keep monitoring.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.460
- Will do.
- Catch you later.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.361
- Sarge.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.744
- Shit.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.988
- On 106.8 FM.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.925
- We've had a few questions
come in during the break.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.427
Here's one from Neil in Exeter.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.564
He says he's managed to
see the shower last night,

04:25.566 --> 04:27.833
with his two boys,
Jacob and Samuel.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.898
- Please, let
me do that for you.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.433
- Thank you.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.635
Maybe your hands are
a little steadier.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.407
Is that an American accent?

05:08.409 --> 05:11.677
- No, Canadian, I transferred
to England from Toronto.

05:11.679 --> 05:12.944
- Oh, I see, dear.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.580
- I know it's hard,
but would you mind

05:15.582 --> 05:17.983
if I took a few more
details from you?

05:17.985 --> 05:19.918
- Of course,
dear, you carry on.

05:21.355 --> 05:24.890
- So, what time did
Mr. Peters return home?

05:24.892 --> 05:28.060
- Oh, please, he would've
preferred you called him John.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.933
It was about quarter to
six, and he seemed fine.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.502
He had a nice time down the pub.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.771
He was looking
forward to his tea.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.441
- And you can't think of any
reason John would've taken

05:42.443 --> 05:45.510
his life, any health problems,
financial difficulties?

05:45.512 --> 05:48.413
- No, John was as fit as a
fiddle, he walked everywhere.

05:48.415 --> 05:53.485
He still looked after that
farm, it's just not like him.

05:54.621 --> 05:55.520
- I'm so sorry.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.060
- I'll be okay, dear.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.131
Would you like a biscuit?

06:18.712 --> 06:19.878
- Was John
a keen gardener

06:19.880 --> 06:21.847
as well as working the farm?

06:21.849 --> 06:23.548
- Not really.

06:23.550 --> 06:27.119
John only did what he had to
when it came to the garden.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.822
- Did you manage to get
a hold of your sister?

06:30.824 --> 06:33.759
- No, no, that phone's
still not working.

06:34.895 --> 06:35.994
- Oh.

06:43.704 --> 06:44.603
Okay.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.073
Let me try and get a message
to her, what's her number?

06:48.075 --> 06:49.908
- Oh, that
would be wonderful, dear.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.176
It's Exbourne.

06:51.178 --> 06:55.147
Two one three, nine five nine.

06:56.683 --> 06:57.582
- Okay.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.621
Whiskey Zulu Two
Zero to front office.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.790
Mathews, are you receiving?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.591
- Mathews
here, go ahead.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.160
- I'm trying to get a hold
of Mrs. Peters' sister.

07:08.162 --> 07:10.128
Can you try to
reach her your end?

07:11.565 --> 07:12.864
- Sorry, Sarge,
the phones are down

07:12.866 --> 07:16.134
across the whole area,
including the station.

07:18.172 --> 07:20.806
- It was my fault!

07:20.808 --> 07:22.674
- Mrs. Peters, please.
- It was my fault!

07:22.676 --> 07:23.608
My god damn fault!

07:23.610 --> 07:26.011
- Please, just put the gun down.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.612
- My god damn fault!

07:27.614 --> 07:29.114
- Mrs. Peters, please, just--
- My god damn fault!

08:15.596 --> 08:19.130
- Amanda from
Thornton on line four.

08:19.132 --> 08:22.100
Amanda, can you tell us what's
happening where you are?

08:23.670 --> 08:27.205
Amanda, you're live on Phonic
FM, you're live on air.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.740
Have we lost, we've lost Amanda?

08:28.742 --> 08:30.175
We've lost Amanda, okay.

08:36.082 --> 08:39.217
- Whiskey Zulu Two
Zero to Whiskey Zulu Eight Six.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.888
- Go ahead.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.756
- Hey, Patrick, I've
had another suicide.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.525
I've had to lock the
scene down until I can get

08:46.527 --> 08:48.126
a hold of someone to
put the balloon up.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.262
It's not ideal, but hey, I
can't sit there all night.

08:50.264 --> 08:52.163
Heading back to the station now.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.633
- Zoe, we've had word

08:54.635 --> 08:56.234
of a disturbance at the tavern.

08:56.236 --> 09:01.106
Not sure what's going on, but
I'm making my way there now.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.044
Zoe?

09:09.583 --> 09:11.716
Zoe, are you still there?

09:12.953 --> 09:15.220
- Yeah, I'll get back to you.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.212
Shit.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.203
Hello?

10:26.860 --> 10:28.093
Where'd he go?

10:30.897 --> 10:33.264
Jesus.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.405
Sir, are you okay?

10:41.675 --> 10:44.309
This is the police,
can I come in?

10:47.981 --> 10:49.914
Sir, please let me in!

10:52.219 --> 10:55.253
- It's trying
to get in the house.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.222
- What is?

10:57.224 --> 10:58.990
Are you alone in the house?

11:01.294 --> 11:03.061
- It's come back for me.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.367
And it wants me, it wants me!

11:10.837 --> 11:13.705
- Sir, there is a lady on
the road outside your house.

11:13.707 --> 11:16.274
Do you know what
happened to her?

11:18.245 --> 11:20.278
- He did that to her.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.919
- Who did?

11:30.724 --> 11:32.090
Please let me in!

11:35.829 --> 11:38.329
- It's in the house.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.231
It's got in the house.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.070
I'm scared.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.408
I know you're there!

11:57.250 --> 11:58.283
Shadows where I can see you!

11:58.285 --> 11:59.984
You bloody coward!

13:26.439 --> 13:29.407
- Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to
Whiskey Zulu Eight Six, urgent.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.377
Can anybody hear me?

13:32.379 --> 13:34.045
I need another unit.

13:35.549 --> 13:36.447
Fuck.

13:41.388 --> 13:42.287
Oh, shit.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.390
Patrick, can you hear me?

13:46.393 --> 13:48.092
- Hey, Zoe, go ahead.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.295
- Patrick, I saw it again, I
mean this time I really saw it.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.430
There is something out here
attacking people, I've got

13:52.432 --> 13:55.400
an unconscious man with severe
injuries and a dead female.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.435
- What did you see?

13:57.437 --> 13:58.937
What do you mean, "something?"

13:58.939 --> 14:01.406
- I don't know, I don't
know how to explain it.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.374
- Okay,
well, keep calm.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.977
How bad is the male?

14:05.979 --> 14:08.880
- I don't know, I
think he's alive.

14:08.882 --> 14:09.981
- All right.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.382
I'll try comms again
and get back to you.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.361
- Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to
Whiskey Zulu Eight Three.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.063
Mathews, are you receiving?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.667
Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to
Whiskey Zulu Eight Six.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.536
Patrick, are you receiving?

16:14.341 --> 16:16.541
Patrick!

16:16.543 --> 16:19.077
Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to
Whiskey Zulu Eight Six.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.045
Patrick, are you receiving?

16:22.182 --> 16:23.982
Oh, come on, Patrick.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.385
- Zoe?

16:27.387 --> 16:29.371
- Yes!

16:29.372 --> 16:31.356
Patrick, I'm heading straight
to the city now to get help.

16:34.728 --> 16:36.761
Patrick?

16:36.763 --> 16:37.662
Patrick!

16:39.132 --> 16:41.399
- Zoe,
there are things here,

16:41.401 --> 16:43.434
and they are killing people.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.335
Fuck.

16:44.337 --> 16:48.573
We managed to escape and are
safe for the moment, but,

16:48.575 --> 16:52.010
they can
find us any minute.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.545
I'm in the back of the
tavern with a few others,

16:54.547 --> 16:56.014
but those things,

16:57.617 --> 17:00.551
they're in the bar and
they're attacking everyone.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.587
They just appeared from nowhere.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.622
I couldn't stop them, I tried,

17:04.624 --> 17:07.625
but if you get
too close, they...

17:08.528 --> 17:09.426
Hang on.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.230
One's coming.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.765
We need to be quiet.

17:17.369 --> 17:20.371
It's scratching at the door.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.739
Okay.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.641
It's moved on.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.210
God, they can move fast.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.579
I don't know what
these things are,

17:28.581 --> 17:31.816
but I think they might have
something to do about comms.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.185
Fuck, what're they doing?

17:34.187 --> 17:35.520
Keep him quiet.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.756
- Patrick, what's happening?

17:41.361 --> 17:42.593
- It's Fernod.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.730
He's putting something
into his eye, oh, shit.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.665
It just came out.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.668
Zoe, his fucking
eye just come out.

17:51.604 --> 17:54.372
Zoe, you need to get help.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.240
You need to get to
the city and get help.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.643
- What the hell?
- We need backup.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.645
We can't manage
this by ourselves.

18:00.647 --> 18:03.247
Zoe, you've got to get
help, you've got to get--

19:55.595 --> 19:56.494
- Patrick?

21:33.926 --> 21:36.761
Patrick.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.832
- Grab his arms.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.801
- What the fuck happened to him?

21:43.803 --> 21:46.037
- It's the landlord, he
just started going nuts.

21:47.774 --> 21:50.341
We had to do this to him to
stop from killing himself.

21:50.343 --> 21:52.743
- You're gonna have
to choke him again.

21:52.745 --> 21:55.713
- On three, one, two, three.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.593
- Okay.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.967
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.737
I'll stay here and
check him over.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.773
- It's okay, he's a vet.

22:22.775 --> 22:25.943
Come through here and
keep as quiet as you can.

22:42.795 --> 22:43.961
You're okay?

22:43.963 --> 22:44.962
- Think so.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.837
Fuck, Patrick, what is goin' on?

22:52.839 --> 22:55.573
What're those things out here?

22:55.575 --> 22:56.907
Have you seen the ships?

22:56.909 --> 22:59.076
- Yeah, we've seen 'em.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.812
- It's fucking aliens.

23:03.449 --> 23:05.149
They're fucking with our
brains and killing us,

23:05.151 --> 23:07.051
and now you've brought
them back here.

23:07.053 --> 23:10.121
- Robbie, will
you calm the fuck down?

23:10.123 --> 23:12.723
- Look, they must've followed
me here from the roadblock,

23:12.725 --> 23:14.992
but I don't think
they saw me come in.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.460
- Roadblock?

23:16.462 --> 23:18.696
- Yeah, the main city road
and the old back road.

23:18.698 --> 23:19.597
- Great.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.906
- I can't see anything.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.908
Happen they've moved off.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.678
- How many shells
have you got left?

23:34.680 --> 23:36.714
- I got three left.

23:36.716 --> 23:39.583
- What about the news,
anybody seen any TV or radio?

23:40.686 --> 23:42.486
- Yeah, it's as
if nothing's happening.

23:42.488 --> 23:43.921
Just another day.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.957
- Do you think it's just
this area they're attacking?

23:46.959 --> 23:48.692
- Why?

23:48.694 --> 23:49.927
What do they want?

23:49.929 --> 23:51.979
We live in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

23:51.980 --> 23:54.030
What can they possibly have
to gain from attacking us?

23:55.101 --> 23:57.568
- They want to
experiment with us,

23:57.570 --> 24:00.604
and it ain't the
first time, either.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.540
Three years ago,

24:03.943 --> 24:07.745
I had one of them circles
in the middle of my club.

24:09.449 --> 24:12.049
Got up in the morning
and there it was!

24:14.086 --> 24:19.156
And then I found they had
butchered two of my prize bulls.

24:19.892 --> 24:20.891
Mutilated them.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.061
And you lot didn't
want to do nothing.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.731
- They're trying to control us.

24:27.733 --> 24:29.500
- He's right.

24:29.502 --> 24:31.168
They want our land.

24:32.905 --> 24:37.107
If it isn't the immigrants,
it's the bleeding aliens.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.011
- Oh, for fuck sake.

24:41.013 --> 24:43.747
- Oh, Dale, I don't think
they'd have come all this way

24:43.749 --> 24:46.116
for a bit of your
hay and British beef.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.552
- Who cares what it
is or what it wants?

24:48.554 --> 24:50.721
How are we gonna
get out of here?

24:50.723 --> 24:53.991
- Okay, everybody, we need
to calm down, she's right.

24:53.993 --> 24:57.528
We just need to focus on
getting ourselves to safety.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.532
How's he doing in there?

25:01.534 --> 25:03.534
- Oh, he's still out cold,
I'm just gonna finish

25:03.536 --> 25:06.504
cleaning up his wounds, try and
stop any further infections.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.105
About all I can do.
- Okay.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.541
Is there any other way we
can make contact with comms?

25:10.543 --> 25:11.842
Try to get some help?

25:11.844 --> 25:14.111
- No, the phones are down,

25:14.113 --> 25:16.280
and there's been nothing
from them on the radios.

25:16.282 --> 25:19.116
- Perhaps they
blocked the frequency?

25:19.118 --> 25:21.852
- Patrick, what
channel does the city use?

25:21.854 --> 25:22.853
- One four nine.

25:25.091 --> 25:28.192
- What good is that,
that thing won't reach the city.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.828
- Doesn't have to, there
should be an ARV unit

25:30.830 --> 25:32.563
from the city in
the area by now.

25:34.100 --> 25:37.167
Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to
any units, come in, please.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.269
- ARV?

25:39.071 --> 25:41.138
- Armed Response Vehicle.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.073
- Fuck yeah.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.842
Now you're talking.

25:44.844 --> 25:47.878
- Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to
any units, come in, please.

25:50.850 --> 25:54.218
- No, wait, the ARVs
use a different channel.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.954
It's four six seven, I think.

25:59.959 --> 26:02.793
- Whiskey Zulu Two Zero to
any units, come in, please.

26:04.096 --> 26:07.932
- Hello,
Whiskey Zulu Two Zero.

26:07.934 --> 26:10.034
This is Delta Tanga Four Six.

26:10.036 --> 26:12.236
We are en route on the station.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.605
- Delta Tango, we are in
urgent need of assistance.

26:14.607 --> 26:15.706
Can you get through to comms?

26:15.708 --> 26:16.874
We've lost contact.

26:18.177 --> 26:21.278
- No, we lost
contact about 10 minutes ago.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.080
What's your situation?

26:26.953 --> 26:28.118
- We're with
members of the public,

26:28.120 --> 26:29.320
and they're under siege.

26:29.322 --> 26:31.255
What's your ETA at the station?

26:32.124 --> 26:33.657
- We're
about 12 miles from--

26:36.195 --> 26:39.129
- It's that lightning again.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.097
- Damn it.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.166
Delta Tango, come in, please.

26:42.168 --> 26:44.201
- They've blocked
all the frequencies.

26:45.204 --> 26:48.038
- Delta Tango, come in, please.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.045
- We're all fucked.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.922
- Look, we know they're
gonna be at the station.

27:04.924 --> 27:06.824
We just need to get
ourselves there.

27:08.294 --> 27:11.095
- There are more shells for
the shotgun at the station.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.266
- What's back there?

27:16.268 --> 27:17.668
- It's where they attacked.

27:18.838 --> 27:21.338
Zoe, they killed
everyone in there.

27:22.942 --> 27:25.242
We only managed to escape by
hiding in the skittle alley.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.149
- No, don't.

27:32.151 --> 27:35.285
They might be in there
again, you'll let them in!

27:35.287 --> 27:37.688
- There might still be
somebody alive in there.

27:44.697 --> 27:45.396
Okay.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.767
Nice and slow.

28:11.223 --> 28:12.589
Shit.

28:12.590 --> 28:13.956
- There was nothing we could do.

29:01.373 --> 29:02.306
Over there.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.257
Move.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.126
- What?
- Move!

29:43.415 --> 29:46.116
- Now it's in here, I told
you not to go out there.

29:46.118 --> 29:53.257
Now it's in here, I told
you not to go out there.

29:53.259 --> 29:54.224
- What happened?

29:54.226 --> 29:56.960
- He bit my fucking fingers off.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.188
- Robbie, no!

30:37.336 --> 30:39.036
It's got Sarah.

30:39.038 --> 30:41.205
- I'll help.
- We've got to go, Zoe.

30:41.207 --> 30:44.041
Come on, Zoe, we've got to go.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.042
Come on!

30:45.044 --> 30:47.044
- My Land Rover's right outside.

30:47.046 --> 30:48.111
- The keys.

30:48.113 --> 30:48.979
Keys!

31:10.970 --> 31:11.869
- Drive!

31:23.349 --> 31:25.582
Can you see anything?
- No, nothing.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.017
They're not following us.

31:27.019 --> 31:29.553
- Fuck, Patrick, see the
size of those things.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.088
Have you seen any
of those already?

31:31.090 --> 31:31.989
- No.

31:32.558 --> 31:33.457
They're new.

31:34.426 --> 31:35.959
- That's a lot of blood.

31:37.529 --> 31:40.497
- In that bag's some
bandages and vodka.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.369
- Why aren't they
coming after us?

31:45.371 --> 31:46.536
- Maybe they don't need to.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.139
- Okay,
what's the plan?

31:49.141 --> 31:51.174
- Get to the station
and wait for the ARV.

31:51.176 --> 31:52.542
- What if they're
watching the roads?

31:52.544 --> 31:54.011
- Maybe they're not
watching all of them.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.245
We need to at least try.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.448
What about Claire and Isaac?

31:59.985 --> 32:02.452
- I hope they're all right.

32:02.454 --> 32:05.222
They've gone to Cornwall for
the weekend, visiting Gran.

32:06.425 --> 32:07.524
Is Jason in the city?

32:08.560 --> 32:09.459
- Yeah.

32:11.563 --> 32:12.996
How are you holding up?

32:14.066 --> 32:15.599
- He got an artery.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.601
I just can't seem to get
enough pressure on it.

32:17.603 --> 32:18.502
Fuck.

32:18.504 --> 32:19.970
- The landlord did that?

32:21.307 --> 32:24.241
- He woke up and just started
chomping down on my hand.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.243
- Is he still back there?

32:26.245 --> 32:29.112
- No, he went out the
back, I couldn't stop him.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.547
- What the fuck is
happening to people?

32:30.549 --> 32:32.349
What are those
things doing to them?

32:32.351 --> 32:34.384
- Like the kid said,
it's mind control.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.554
- Controlling our minds so
that we murder ourselves?

32:37.556 --> 32:40.090
- So we kill ourselves.
- But why?

32:40.092 --> 32:42.225
- Stop the car.
- So that they can take over!

32:42.227 --> 32:43.560
- Seriously.
- Stop the car.

32:43.562 --> 32:46.496
- I don't think they need
mind control to take over.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.165
- Stop the fucking car!

32:57.409 --> 32:59.576
I think it's an infection.

32:59.578 --> 33:02.346
I think they're infecting us
with something, maybe a virus.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.350
Aggression,
confusion, self-harm.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.418
They're all symptoms
in brain infection.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.159
- Why kill us with a virus?

33:17.229 --> 33:18.495
- Why not?

33:18.497 --> 33:20.764
Maybe we're just an experiment.

33:23.469 --> 33:24.468
- Lab rats?

33:24.469 --> 33:25.468
- So, now do you
think you're infected?

33:29.541 --> 33:31.708
Well, Robbie and Sarah hadn't
been attacked by anyone or

33:31.710 --> 33:34.611
a thing, like, you don't know
that's how it's transmitted.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.646
- True, but there's a
good chance I am now,

33:36.648 --> 33:40.417
and you'll be safer if
you get me out of the car.

33:42.654 --> 33:45.322
- I think he's right, I
think we should let him out.

33:48.527 --> 33:49.626
- Keep driving.

33:57.469 --> 33:58.735
We keep moving.

34:01.407 --> 34:03.540
I have dealt with
four suicides today,

34:03.542 --> 34:06.143
and not one of them
had been attacked.

34:06.145 --> 34:09.279
If this is a virus, then it
seems to be affecting everybody,

34:09.281 --> 34:12.215
and if anyone of us starts
showing symptoms, I would rather

34:12.217 --> 34:15.252
you were around than lying on
a roadside bleeding to death.

34:17.623 --> 34:19.656
Let's just get to the station.

34:39.178 --> 34:41.511
- Do you think your
mates are here yet?

34:41.513 --> 34:43.746
- Don't think so,
can't see their car.

34:54.193 --> 34:55.425
- Get them in.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.127
I'm gonna go and check
the side door is locked.

34:57.129 --> 34:58.628
I'll see you back
at the front desk.

34:58.630 --> 35:01.298
- Sounds
good, see you in five.

36:52.544 --> 36:55.378
- Mathews!

37:14.266 --> 37:15.365
Mathews, no!

37:41.360 --> 37:42.259
- Zoe.

37:49.968 --> 37:50.867
Is that...

38:04.383 --> 38:05.282
He's gone.

38:09.655 --> 38:12.722
- How are we supposed
to fight these things?

38:14.926 --> 38:17.594
All those people
and now Mathews.

38:20.332 --> 38:22.732
I tried to stop him, but
I couldn't get to him.

38:22.734 --> 38:23.633
- Hey, hey.

38:24.503 --> 38:25.402
I know.

38:26.738 --> 38:27.671
It's okay.

38:28.540 --> 38:29.906
You can't save everyone, Zoe.

38:29.908 --> 38:34.678
Just concentrate on getting the
rest of us out of here okay?

38:38.450 --> 38:40.950
Come on, Zoe, we need you.

38:41.887 --> 38:42.952
- Okay.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.024
Okay.

38:55.701 --> 38:56.599
Okay.

38:58.537 --> 39:02.405
Let's get to the property
store and get to that ammo.

39:03.542 --> 39:07.677
We just have to hold out
until the ARV arrives.

39:07.679 --> 39:08.878
- Yes, Sarge.

39:35.107 --> 39:36.539
- How's the hand?

39:38.110 --> 39:40.810
- Probably not gonna be writing
prescriptions for a while.

39:42.781 --> 39:45.014
- Can I take a look?
- Probably best not to.

39:46.485 --> 39:48.151
Not until I can
change the dressing.

39:50.422 --> 39:53.957
So what's a Canadian doing in
our sleepy rural police force?

39:55.026 --> 39:56.526
- I transferred
here with my fiance

39:56.528 --> 39:58.762
to be closer to his parents.

40:00.065 --> 40:03.400
- They live round here?
- Oh, in the city, thank god.

40:03.402 --> 40:05.502
This was the closest
posting I could get.

40:06.138 --> 40:08.037
- Not what you're used to?

40:08.039 --> 40:09.038
- No, not really.

40:10.442 --> 40:12.008
Actually, I was disappointed

40:12.010 --> 40:14.577
I couldn't get a more
exciting post in the city.

40:16.982 --> 40:19.582
- What time did all
this start today?

40:19.584 --> 40:23.586
- Um, Mr. Peters was the
first, I guess, about six PM?

40:26.458 --> 40:29.192
God, he shot himself just
after he got home from the pub.

40:34.499 --> 40:36.900
- What time did
he get to the pub?

40:36.902 --> 40:38.468
- Oh, I don't know, why?

40:38.470 --> 40:39.769
Is that important?

40:41.072 --> 40:42.505
- Could be.
- Shh!

40:55.454 --> 40:57.754
- Look at
the size of them.

40:57.756 --> 40:59.956
- They're just standing
there, watching.

41:01.059 --> 41:02.659
Do you think they
know we're in here?

41:08.533 --> 41:10.567
- I'd say that's a safe bet.

41:11.703 --> 41:14.537
- What happens if
they get in here?

41:19.010 --> 41:20.109
- Maybe they already are.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.580
Okay, we need to search
the rest of the building,

41:23.582 --> 41:25.148
and make sure it's secure.

41:26.184 --> 41:27.684
We could be here a while.

41:30.522 --> 41:31.221
Oh.

41:37.229 --> 41:39.729
- That's all we've got.
- Okay.

41:39.731 --> 41:41.130
- Look, it's gonna take forever

41:41.132 --> 41:43.933
to search this place
with those two.

41:43.935 --> 41:45.235
- Okay, well, let's get
them somewhere safe,

41:45.237 --> 41:47.103
and you and I can search.

41:47.973 --> 41:49.072
- The cells.

41:49.074 --> 41:50.740
They're cut off from
the main corridors.

41:50.742 --> 41:53.076
- That's good, there's
medical supplies there, too.

41:55.747 --> 41:57.013
Can you carry him?

41:57.015 --> 41:58.081
- Sure.

42:00.685 --> 42:02.018
Dale, grab the other arm.

42:03.221 --> 42:05.188
- Can't you take that one?

42:05.190 --> 42:06.523
- Oh, for fuck sake.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.827
- Right, up.

42:20.872 --> 42:23.006
Where's everybody else?

42:23.008 --> 42:24.207
- We're pretty much it.

42:26.878 --> 42:27.711
Cutbacks.

42:27.712 --> 42:28.545
Station isn't used much anymore.

42:28.547 --> 42:30.847
Everything goes
through the city.

42:30.849 --> 42:32.282
- Why's it so big?

42:32.284 --> 42:35.318
- Used to be an old
MOD training post.

42:35.320 --> 42:37.120
Guess now they just don't
know what to do with it.

42:37.122 --> 42:38.187
- Oh.

42:40.825 --> 42:42.058
- They you go.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.962
- Sit him down
in the interview room.

42:45.964 --> 42:46.930
I'll grab the kit.

43:13.758 --> 43:16.125
- Slowly, keep
the pressure on.

43:16.127 --> 43:17.293
- How's that?
- Good.

43:22.067 --> 43:23.766
- How are you doing?

43:23.768 --> 43:24.701
- I'll live.

43:26.237 --> 43:28.271
Hold it there.
- Right there?

43:28.273 --> 43:29.939
Need one of those, tape and--

43:31.142 --> 43:32.742
- What else?

43:32.744 --> 43:36.079
- The base of the thumb,
as tight as you can.

43:37.115 --> 43:40.149
- What, like that?

43:40.151 --> 43:41.250
- Hey.

43:42.187 --> 43:43.753
Dale, are you okay?

43:43.755 --> 43:45.989
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

43:45.991 --> 43:48.291
Don't worry about me.

43:48.293 --> 43:50.860
- Okay, look, you
try and get some rest,

43:50.862 --> 43:52.795
while Patrick and I
secure the station, okay?

43:52.797 --> 43:53.696
- Yeah, I will.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.366
- Ready?
- Yep.

43:56.368 --> 43:59.669
- Dale, you're gonna have
to lock the door behind us.

43:59.671 --> 44:00.737
- Yeah, okay.

44:15.353 --> 44:17.820
- Okay, first we'll
check down here,

44:17.822 --> 44:20.256
and then we'll start
a sweep upstairs.

44:20.258 --> 44:21.724
The east corridor was secure.

44:21.725 --> 44:23.191
How were things when
you came round the back?

44:23.194 --> 44:25.895
- All good, most of those
rooms are locked anyway.

44:25.897 --> 44:28.798
- Okay, that just leaves that
corridor and the west side.

44:29.901 --> 44:31.934
And that'll lead us
to the stairwell.

44:54.259 --> 44:55.925
What do they want?

44:57.996 --> 45:00.229
What do they have to
gain from infecting us?

45:01.232 --> 45:02.699
- Dale could be right.

45:03.835 --> 45:05.401
Maybe they do want
what we've got.

45:07.238 --> 45:09.739
- They're gonna get that
by experimenting on us?

45:11.142 --> 45:12.742
- Maybe they're
trying to find our weaknesses.

45:12.744 --> 45:14.277
- Mm, yeah, I guess.

45:15.447 --> 45:18.715
Don't you think
that's a little odd?

45:41.072 --> 45:41.971
In here.

45:47.011 --> 45:49.812
- Get away from me,
you bitch, get away!

45:49.814 --> 45:50.513
Go!

45:53.251 --> 45:55.184
Get away from me, you fucks!

45:55.186 --> 45:56.252
- Freddie, please calm down.

45:56.254 --> 45:58.254
Look, we're trying
to help you here.

45:58.256 --> 46:00.389
- You think you're
so fucking special!

46:00.391 --> 46:02.525
- Freddie, drop the knife.

46:02.527 --> 46:04.127
Put the knife down, now.

46:04.129 --> 46:06.295
- Who else have you got in here?

46:06.297 --> 46:08.865
I'll kill every
one of you fuckers!

46:16.107 --> 46:18.074
Motherfuckers!

46:51.476 --> 46:52.375
- Shit!

46:53.912 --> 46:55.311
- Back this way.

47:03.188 --> 47:04.587
- It's coming.

47:04.589 --> 47:05.488
- I know.

47:10.161 --> 47:12.295
- There, quick.

47:42.393 --> 47:43.559
- Can you carry on?

47:46.998 --> 47:48.297
- Yeah.

47:48.299 --> 47:49.198
I'll be fine.

48:11.623 --> 48:13.122
Dale.

48:13.124 --> 48:14.056
Dale!

48:19.497 --> 48:20.563
Dale!

48:25.403 --> 48:27.503
Dale, open the fucking door!

48:37.982 --> 48:40.516
Dale, open the fucking door now!

48:42.053 --> 48:44.987
Dale!

48:46.224 --> 48:48.324
Dale!
- Patrick!

48:49.527 --> 48:54.597
- Open the...

49:05.143 --> 49:06.642
Come on, come on!

49:13.351 --> 49:14.467
Shit.

49:14.468 --> 49:15.584
- Let's take
a look at that arm.

49:15.586 --> 49:16.986
- What
took you so long?

49:18.389 --> 49:20.323
Where's Dale?
- It's not good.

49:20.324 --> 49:22.258
I had to wrestle him
into one of the cells.

49:22.260 --> 49:25.728
Could hear voices and the
banging, I just wasn't sure.

49:25.730 --> 49:29.065
- Wasn't sure about
what?

49:29.067 --> 49:30.333
- My head is killing me.

49:34.072 --> 49:35.538
What happened?

49:35.540 --> 49:37.406
- He got stabbed by a prisoner.

49:39.077 --> 49:40.176
- Bastard!

49:41.412 --> 49:43.012
- How many of them
are out there?

49:43.014 --> 49:43.713
- Too many.

49:45.283 --> 49:48.250
- Any sign of the ARV guys?
- No.

49:48.252 --> 49:50.052
Looks like we're on our own.

49:50.054 --> 49:52.121
- It's okay, I can
walk from here.

49:54.292 --> 49:55.391
- Are you okay?

49:57.295 --> 50:00.229
- It's just a headache,
I can take it from here.

50:01.366 --> 50:02.665
- Okay, good.

50:02.667 --> 50:04.266
I'm gonna go check on Dale.

50:18.549 --> 50:20.449
- I know what you're thinking.

50:22.120 --> 50:24.754
You're thinking I'm
gonna get you all killed.

50:26.524 --> 50:29.658
Just 'cause my legs aren't
what they used to be,

50:29.660 --> 50:32.595
doesn't mean that
I'm bloody useless!

50:35.566 --> 50:36.732
Don't leave me here.

50:39.337 --> 50:41.370
- I'm not gonna leave you.

50:41.372 --> 50:44.573
We're all gonna get outta
here and get you to some help.

50:46.210 --> 50:47.643
- I don't need any help!

50:49.647 --> 50:52.348
Get yourselves some bloody help!

50:56.187 --> 50:57.620
I'm sorry.

51:01.225 --> 51:03.626
I'm just feeling a little
stressed at the moment.

51:05.096 --> 51:07.530
I'm not feeling myself.

51:08.399 --> 51:09.432
I'm fine.

51:10.468 --> 51:11.367
Fine.

51:18.376 --> 51:19.275
- Zoe.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.854
We need to find a way
out of the station.

51:31.856 --> 51:34.623
The closer those things get the
crazier people start acting.

51:34.625 --> 51:38.360
- That I know, Mitchell's
not looking too good, either.

51:38.362 --> 51:39.795
- And if the ARV
unit doesn't arrive--

51:39.797 --> 51:41.464
- I know, I know, look.

51:43.134 --> 51:44.567
We'll think of something, okay?

51:44.569 --> 51:46.235
I mean, as long as
these doors hold,

51:46.237 --> 51:48.237
then we're safe in here, right?

51:48.239 --> 51:48.871
- I guess.

51:48.873 --> 51:50.639
- Zoe?

51:50.641 --> 51:52.441
Better get over here.

52:01.185 --> 52:02.785
- Oh, god, Dale,
what is going on?

52:02.787 --> 52:04.386
Dale, what are you doing?

52:04.388 --> 52:06.222
Patrick, get this door open now.

52:10.261 --> 52:11.727
- Shit.
- Come on!

52:11.729 --> 52:13.195
- Okay, okay.

52:21.339 --> 52:22.605
- Dale!

52:22.607 --> 52:23.506
Dale!

52:24.275 --> 52:25.674
Can you hear me?

52:46.364 --> 52:47.263
Come on!

52:49.433 --> 52:51.433
Come on, Dale, wake up!

52:52.270 --> 52:54.403
No, try again, try again!

52:57.175 --> 52:59.542
- One, two, three!

53:04.515 --> 53:07.483
- He's gone.
- No, try again!

53:07.485 --> 53:08.384
- Zoe?

53:10.521 --> 53:11.353
He's gone.

53:11.355 --> 53:12.254
- No.

53:15.293 --> 53:20.362
No.

53:46.490 --> 53:47.389
- Where's Zoe?

53:50.661 --> 53:51.894
Hey, Mitchell.

53:55.533 --> 53:56.398
You okay?

53:57.435 --> 53:58.400
- Yeah, fine.

54:00.671 --> 54:01.570
- Where's Zoe?

54:02.773 --> 54:03.872
- She's down the other end.

54:25.863 --> 54:27.446
- What're you up to?

54:27.447 --> 54:29.030
- I haven't seen any of
them out there for a while.

54:34.405 --> 54:35.804
If we could get
to the other side,

54:35.806 --> 54:37.873
we could get to the rear
exit in the Land Rover.

54:39.377 --> 54:41.610
- It could work.

54:42.813 --> 54:43.912
- How's that arm?

54:43.914 --> 54:45.547
You think you can
get through there?

54:46.884 --> 54:47.850
- Yeah, not a problem.

54:49.887 --> 54:50.953
What about Mitchell?

54:51.822 --> 54:53.489
He's getting worse.
- Yeah, I know.

54:53.491 --> 54:56.859
He's not great, but we don't
have many options here.

54:58.462 --> 54:59.828
- Okay.

54:59.830 --> 55:00.863
Let's do it.

55:06.604 --> 55:08.804
- Hey, Mitchell.

55:08.806 --> 55:10.339
How are you feeling?

55:10.341 --> 55:11.840
- What time is it?

55:12.943 --> 55:14.977
- Look, we think we've
found a way out of here.

55:14.979 --> 55:17.746
Do you think you're
okay to move?

55:17.748 --> 55:19.315
- A way out?

55:19.317 --> 55:21.950
Why, why do we want to get out?

55:23.821 --> 55:26.955
- Okay, buddy, come
on, time to move.

55:53.617 --> 55:55.651
- Are they coming back yet?
- Shh.

55:55.653 --> 55:58.520
- Mitchell, you have to
be quiet, can you do that?

56:27.385 --> 56:28.083
Let's go.

56:46.504 --> 56:47.169
- I'm next.

56:51.842 --> 56:53.075
I'm next.

56:53.077 --> 56:55.010
- Try to stay calm and breathe.

56:58.616 --> 57:01.016
- What time is it?
- He's making too much noise.

57:01.018 --> 57:03.018
- It's gonna come
soon, I know who's next.

57:03.020 --> 57:06.021
- Mitchell, you
have to be quiet.

57:06.924 --> 57:08.457
- What time is it?

57:08.459 --> 57:09.925
What time is it!

57:13.631 --> 57:15.164
We need more time.

57:24.074 --> 57:25.507
- Come on.

57:25.509 --> 57:27.509
- You don't know
what you're doing!

57:27.511 --> 57:29.745
- Mitchell, we have to go.

57:30.848 --> 57:32.014
- Get off me.

57:37.655 --> 57:38.654
We're here.

57:39.890 --> 57:41.623
We--

57:41.625 --> 57:42.591
- Get back.

57:57.241 --> 57:59.041
Come on, you fuckers.

58:12.556 --> 58:14.957
- That's the last two.

58:28.939 --> 58:31.607
- That's it, I'm out.

58:41.218 --> 58:42.684
- Stay down!

58:55.165 --> 58:56.665
Clear!

58:56.667 --> 58:57.566
- Clear!

58:59.036 --> 59:00.269
- Is anybody else
in the building?

59:00.271 --> 59:01.837
- Look out!

59:23.060 --> 59:24.560
- Get the guns!

59:33.203 --> 59:35.003
Get him to the Land Lover.

59:35.005 --> 59:36.171
- Come on, get up!

59:57.027 --> 59:57.926
Come on!

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:34.196
Here, I managed to
grab an extra mag.

01:00:34.198 --> 01:00:36.398
You must be almost out.
- Thanks.

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:42.904
So, what now, where do we go?

01:00:44.341 --> 01:00:47.142
- More people will
have to come soon.

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:49.344
Those things can't keep
us cut off forever.

01:00:50.848 --> 01:00:53.248
Until then, we just need to
find somewhere safe to lay low.

01:00:54.385 --> 01:00:57.219
- Hey, we should
stay off the main roads.

01:01:05.663 --> 01:01:06.361
- Zoe?

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.333
I figured it out.

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:15.270
- What is it, Mitchell,
what have you figured out?

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:16.171
- The farm.

01:01:18.942 --> 01:01:20.559
- What farm?

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.177
- You got the farm before
Patrick got to the pub.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.047
- So, what does that mean?

01:01:30.054 --> 01:01:31.286
- You're next.

01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:13.789
- I don't even remember leaving

01:03:13.791 --> 01:03:15.490
the fucking handgun in there!

01:03:34.812 --> 01:03:36.178
This ain't over yet.

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:38.380
- I know.

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:41.383
- We keep fighting.

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:45.320
- Yeah.

01:04:12.216 --> 01:04:13.348
- Hey, Zoe.

01:04:14.418 --> 01:04:15.517
- What is it?

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:17.853
- Someone's coming.

01:04:35.239 --> 01:04:36.605
- Let's see what he knows.

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:47.315
- Are you okay?

01:04:47.317 --> 01:04:48.450
I heard the gunshots.

01:04:49.286 --> 01:04:50.318
- We're fine.

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:52.554
- Any of those things out here?

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:54.389
- No, don't think so.

01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:57.459
- I haven't seen any for
a couple of hours, but,

01:04:57.461 --> 01:04:59.995
I wouldn't go any further
that way, if I was you.

01:04:59.997 --> 01:05:01.463
They've got the road blocked.

01:05:01.465 --> 01:05:02.464
- Ah, shit.

01:05:02.466 --> 01:05:06.334
Look, we can't stay out
in the open like this.

01:05:08.272 --> 01:05:10.071
- Is your house close by?

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:12.440
- Yeah, just a little
up the road there.

01:05:12.442 --> 01:05:14.509
Come on, this way,
before we're spotted.

01:05:18.582 --> 01:05:21.383
I thought you buggers were
meant to be rescuing me.

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:25.387
When's the cavalry coming?
- Our comms have been down.

01:05:25.389 --> 01:05:27.389
We haven't been able
to get word out.

01:05:27.391 --> 01:05:28.290
- Figures.

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:55.650
- Check the back.

01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:05.593
Anything?

01:06:05.595 --> 01:06:06.695
- No.

01:06:06.697 --> 01:06:08.530
I think we're good.

01:06:08.532 --> 01:06:10.498
- Is there
anybody else here?

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.599
- No.

01:06:13.337 --> 01:06:16.504
Bastards got to my Kathy at
the beginning of all this.

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:17.605
- I'm sorry.

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:22.711
- I'll get more of them,
though, before it's over.

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:27.649
Drink?

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:36.691
That cut out about an hour ago.

01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:47.635
So, did you get any of 'em?

01:06:52.242 --> 01:06:54.509
We shot some of
those machines, but,

01:06:55.645 --> 01:06:57.145
it doesn't make a difference.

01:06:58.248 --> 01:07:00.415
- What about those big buggers?

01:07:00.417 --> 01:07:03.585
Have you noticed how
they keep their distance?

01:07:03.587 --> 01:07:05.587
Bloody cowards.

01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:09.124
It's their drones, they're the
ones that do the dirty work.

01:07:12.596 --> 01:07:13.595
- What happened here?

01:07:18.435 --> 01:07:21.102
- Me and the wife were
having a row about something.

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:24.472
All of a sudden, she
starts to go nuts.

01:07:24.474 --> 01:07:27.142
She's shaking, like
she's having a fit.

01:07:29.646 --> 01:07:33.248
But her feet, her feet are
barely touching the ground.

01:07:36.053 --> 01:07:37.352
And that's when I saw it.

01:07:37.354 --> 01:07:41.623
By the time I'd grabbed
my shotgun, she was
already lying on

01:07:41.625 --> 01:07:45.560
the floor and that thing was
stood there in all its glory.

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:49.397
Bam, I shot it, point blank.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:51.499
And that
was when I noticed

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:54.502
one of the big ones looking
in through the window.

01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:58.073
And I missed him,
but I went outside,

01:07:58.075 --> 01:07:59.774
and I corned him by the barn.

01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:03.678
He knew exactly what
I had in my hand.

01:08:05.449 --> 01:08:08.416
He backed into that
barn like a little girl.

01:08:10.454 --> 01:08:12.353
I bet he's in there now,

01:08:12.355 --> 01:08:14.322
wishing he never
came to this house.

01:08:18.462 --> 01:08:20.428
- Are you saying that you've got

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:22.764
one of those things
locked in your barn?

01:08:25.769 --> 01:08:28.336
- Oh, don't worry, love,
he's not going anywhere.

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:31.372
Do you wanna see it?

01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:33.640
Oh, you're gonna love this.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.654
You're gonna bloody love this.

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:58.867
- Zoe, this doesn't feel--

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:00.535
- I know.

01:09:00.537 --> 01:09:02.604
I know, let's just take a look.

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:07.709
- How bad is it?

01:09:09.412 --> 01:09:10.444
- I'm okay.

01:09:10.447 --> 01:09:11.345
It's fine.

01:09:22.826 --> 01:09:25.593
- If there's any reward,
it's my find, okay?

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:27.828
- Fine.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.907
- Hope you're not squeamish.

01:09:52.589 --> 01:09:53.488
- Holy fuck.

01:10:02.299 --> 01:10:03.831
- What do you think?

01:10:19.749 --> 01:10:21.783
Can you believe it?

01:10:21.785 --> 01:10:25.954
It's still alive, even
after I cut it in two.

01:10:25.956 --> 01:10:28.389
They're resilient buggers.

01:10:30.293 --> 01:10:30.992
You want a go?

01:10:33.496 --> 01:10:34.829
- This is wrong.

01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:37.432
- No?

01:10:37.434 --> 01:10:38.566
Fine.

01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:42.737
I'll show you how to do it.

01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:55.617
- What the hell have
you been doing here?

01:10:55.619 --> 01:10:56.751
- What have I been doing here?

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:58.620
I've been waging war, son.

01:10:58.622 --> 01:10:59.754
Fighting the fight!

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:01.723
What've you been doing?

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:11.332
- This...

01:11:11.334 --> 01:11:13.334
This is not fighting.

01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:20.441
- We need to show these bastards
who they're messing with.

01:11:36.926 --> 01:11:39.927
I'll give you
something to moan at.

01:11:41.064 --> 01:11:46.000
Think you can come here,
take over our bloody planet.

01:11:47.003 --> 01:11:49.704
Well, it's our fucking planet.

01:11:49.706 --> 01:11:50.805
And you?

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:52.874
You can fuck off home.

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:20.401
Let's see what these
bastards are made of.

01:12:20.403 --> 01:12:22.670
- Come on, Zoe.

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:24.639
We've gotta get out of here now.

01:12:24.641 --> 01:12:25.673
Come on.

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:27.041
Come on, let's go.

01:12:56.973 --> 01:12:59.006
- They're not attacking.

01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:01.976
- Where are you going?

01:13:20.063 --> 01:13:21.529
- Patrick!

01:13:25.168 --> 01:13:27.068
Can't get through!

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:29.537
- Come on, this way!

01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:54.095
- I think they're coming.

01:13:56.099 --> 01:13:57.598
- Keep running!

01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:14.749
- Which way?

01:14:16.686 --> 01:14:18.085
- Zoe.

01:14:18.087 --> 01:14:18.986
Look.

01:14:23.493 --> 01:14:24.125
Come on.

01:14:24.127 --> 01:14:25.026
Let's go.

01:14:30.066 --> 01:14:31.165
Come on!

01:14:51.955 --> 01:14:54.021
- Don't they have
any other weapons?

01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:56.224
Why are they not just
killing us on sight?

01:14:56.226 --> 01:14:57.592
- I don't know.

01:15:00.563 --> 01:15:01.762
- I'm so cold.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.198
- Shit.

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:08.569
There's more of them.

01:15:08.571 --> 01:15:10.271
Come on, Zoe, come on.

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:22.720

01:15:24.721 --> 01:15:26.120
Go, I've got this.

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:31.592
- Get in!

01:15:51.147 --> 01:15:53.180
- Get down!

01:15:59.322 --> 01:16:00.154
Okay.

01:16:24.314 --> 01:16:26.147
- My god, look at these people.

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:47.101
My fucking head is killing me.

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:48.202
- Hey, hey.

01:16:48.204 --> 01:16:49.270
You're okay.

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:52.373
Hang in there.

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:55.376
Keep going, you'll be fine.

01:17:06.723 --> 01:17:09.190
Come on, Zoe, we need to move.

01:17:20.069 --> 01:17:21.135
- Look.

01:17:23.172 --> 01:17:25.239
- Shit.
- What do we do?

01:17:25.241 --> 01:17:26.741
We've got nowhere else to go.

01:17:58.207 --> 01:17:59.740
- Zoe, come on.

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:09.383
- We're trapped, Patrick,
what's the point in running?

01:18:09.385 --> 01:18:12.787
- Look, we don't give
up, we keep going.

01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:18.426
- No, wait.

01:18:21.330 --> 01:18:22.396
Ma'am, are you okay?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.466
Do you feel okay?

01:18:25.468 --> 01:18:28.369
- I think I've been asleep.

01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:29.336
- Please, take a seat.

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:33.307
What happened to you?

01:18:33.309 --> 01:18:35.176
- I can't remember.

01:18:36.345 --> 01:18:37.244
I don't know.

01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:51.358
- Sir, do you feel okay?

01:18:55.264 --> 01:18:56.897
He's okay, he's fine.

01:18:59.736 --> 01:19:01.235
- What's going on,
what're you doing here?

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:03.370
- It's okay, sir,
please stay calm.

01:19:06.275 --> 01:19:07.742
It's okay, take it easy.

01:19:11.414 --> 01:19:13.380
It's okay, remain calm.

01:19:17.353 --> 01:19:20.154
- My god, everybody's
fine, everybody's okay.

01:19:20.156 --> 01:19:21.222
What have I done?

01:19:21.224 --> 01:19:25.860
- Zoe, keep it together,
you didn't do anything.

01:19:25.862 --> 01:19:27.962
- No, think about it, Mitchell.

01:19:27.964 --> 01:19:30.364
Back at the station, he
had it all figured out.

01:19:32.034 --> 01:19:33.868
- No, no, Mitchell was crazy.

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:35.469
He was trying to
kill himself, and us.

01:19:35.471 --> 01:19:38.405
- Oh, no, no, no,
he was going crazy,

01:19:38.407 --> 01:19:40.241
but he wasn't there yet.

01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:44.245
He was trying to save
himself and I didn't let him.

01:19:47.216 --> 01:19:51.252
What if, what if they've been
trying to help all night,

01:19:51.254 --> 01:19:53.888
and I have been stopping them?

01:19:55.992 --> 01:19:57.491
- Zoe, come on,
you're losing it.

01:19:57.493 --> 01:19:58.359
Stay with me.

01:19:59.462 --> 01:20:00.528
We can get through this.

01:20:05.368 --> 01:20:08.135
- Did I kill all those people?

01:20:10.506 --> 01:20:12.006
- Zoe, come on.

01:20:12.008 --> 01:20:12.973
I need your help.

01:20:14.377 --> 01:20:15.810
- Wait, wait!

01:20:15.812 --> 01:20:16.510
Look at it!

01:20:18.014 --> 01:20:19.413
What if it's not a soldier?

01:20:19.415 --> 01:20:21.482
What if it's a fucking medic?

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:27.988
- Zoe, come on.

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:29.089
Snap out of it.

01:20:30.426 --> 01:20:31.492
- God, he was right.

01:20:33.496 --> 01:20:35.596
It started at the farm.

01:20:35.598 --> 01:20:39.133
Something happened to
that farmer and it spread!

01:20:39.135 --> 01:20:40.534
- Just stop.

01:20:40.536 --> 01:20:42.069
What're you doing?

01:20:42.071 --> 01:20:43.504
- It's okay, Patrick.

01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:45.139
I know what I'm doing now.

01:20:47.577 --> 01:20:50.211
- Zoe, don't!

01:20:50.213 --> 01:20:51.078
Zoe, no!

01:20:52.582 --> 01:20:53.447
Fight it!

01:20:56.853 --> 01:20:57.518
Zoe!

01:20:58.955 --> 01:21:01.021
Zoe, no!

01:21:01.023 --> 01:21:02.523
Out of my way!

01:21:02.525 --> 01:21:04.291
Get out of my way!

01:21:08.464 --> 01:21:09.363
Zoe!

01:21:10.399 --> 01:21:11.298
Zoe!

01:21:20.543 --> 01:21:21.442
Zoe!

01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:44.298
Zoe!

01:22:00.082 --> 01:22:00.948
No!

01:22:12.561 --> 01:22:13.527
You bastards!
