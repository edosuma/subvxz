that you keep going back to.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.699
And then I keep running
away from him.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.659
Why do I keep running
away from him?

11:00.743 --> 11:02.578
Why, Princeton, why?

11:02.661 --> 11:04.538
Well, if I tell you,
it's not going to mean as much

11:04.622 --> 11:06.082
as if you figure
it out for yourself.

11:06.165 --> 11:09.001
Yeah, but I'm not gonna.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.586
Alright, um..

11:10.669 --> 11:13.089
What do you picture
your relationship

11:13.172 --> 11:14.256
with Vince being like?

11:14.340 --> 11:16.759
I don't know, regular.

11:16.842 --> 11:20.012
Just the two of us sitting
around, having a cup of coffee.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.223
Like this.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.061
<i>(Holly)</i>
<i>Maybe at a quaint</i>
<i>little cafe.</i>

11:27.144 --> 11:28.646
<i>A bistro.</i>

11:30.314 --> 11:33.359
<i>With little twinkly lights..</i>

11:33.442 --> 11:35.069
<i>...in Paree.</i>

11:37.029 --> 11:39.407
<i>With romantic music..</i>

11:39.490 --> 11:41.492
[violin music]

11:47.790 --> 11:49.542
<i>...and French people.</i>

11:49.625 --> 11:51.335
<i>Nice ones.</i>

11:54.380 --> 11:57.508
<i>And of course, we'd both be</i>
<i>wearing</i> <i>something amazing.</i>

12:02.555 --> 12:04.473
<i>And Vince would look</i>
<i>into my eyes</i>

12:04.557 --> 12:05.975
<i>and say he couldn't stand</i>

12:06.058 --> 12:09.270
<i>being away from me</i>
<i>for five minutes.</i>

12:09.353 --> 12:10.479
I couldn't stand being away

12:10.563 --> 12:12.398
from you for five minutes.

12:12.481 --> 12:13.482
If I didn't have to get change

12:13.566 --> 12:14.984
I never would've left.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.070
Everything is so perfect.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.364
I wish it could always
be like this.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.784
[speaking in French]

12:23.868 --> 12:25.369
<i>(Henry)</i>
<i>Vince speaks French?</i>

12:25.453 --> 12:28.789
<i>(Holly)</i>
<i>Hey, it's my fantasy.</i>

12:28.873 --> 12:30.124
Did I tell you that
they're publishing

12:30.207 --> 12:31.750
my novel based on our love?

12:31.834 --> 12:33.252
What?

12:33.335 --> 12:34.462
<i>(Henry)</i>
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>Vince speaks French</i>

12:34.545 --> 12:36.130
<i>and he wrote a novel?</i>

12:36.213 --> 12:39.258
<i>(Holly)</i>
<i>And he has a castle</i>
<i>in Ireland.</i>

12:41.093 --> 12:44.180
I am so glad that we finally
worked everything out.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.057
- And now we're together.
- So am I.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.019
I love you, Holly.

12:51.979 --> 12:54.440
Okay, well, I gotta go.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.567
<i>(Henry)</i>
<i>What?</i>

12:56.650 --> 12:57.693
Why did you leave?

12:57.776 --> 13:00.112
Because everything
was so perfect.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.448
It wasn't gonna get
any better than that.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.782
How do you know?

13:03.866 --> 13:06.494
Because romance
can't last forever.

13:06.577 --> 13:08.329
Yeah, okay, you're right.
It can't.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.956
But you know what happens
after that?

13:11.040 --> 13:13.083
- No.
- Well, come on.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.961
- You're gonna find out.
- No, I don't wanna go.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.755
Let go, let go.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.007
- I don't wanna--
- Too late.

13:21.800 --> 13:22.760
Now continue.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.136
Hey, Henry.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.681
Hey, dude, thanks
for all the calls.

13:27.765 --> 13:30.809
Hey, Vince, what were you
saying right before Holly left?

13:30.893 --> 13:33.604
Oh, I was saying..

13:35.439 --> 13:38.150
...I love you, Holly.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.318
I gotta go.

13:39.401 --> 13:41.779
No, this time,
you're gonna stay.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.531
I don't like it here anymore,
I gotta go.

13:43.614 --> 13:44.907
- Why, Holly?
- Yeah, why, Holly?

13:44.990 --> 13:46.242
- 'Cause she's scared.
- Scared of what?

13:46.325 --> 13:47.409
- I'm not scared.
- Yes, you are.

13:47.493 --> 13:48.494
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

13:48.577 --> 13:51.163
No, I'm not.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.541
Yes, I am.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.460
What are you afraid of?

13:56.544 --> 13:59.255
[sighs]

13:59.338 --> 14:02.091
I'm afraid of what happens
after things

14:02.174 --> 14:05.052
aren't perfect anymore.

14:05.135 --> 14:08.013
Holly..

14:08.097 --> 14:10.599
...nothing's perfect.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.935
I mean, sometimes
we're gonna fight.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.937
We're gonna get annoyed
with each other.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.439
We may even get bored
with each other.

14:17.523 --> 14:21.110
Sometimes, one of us could get
really bloated and crampy

14:21.193 --> 14:23.904
and yell at me
for no reason at all.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.866
But that's life.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.201
It's real.

14:29.285 --> 14:33.122
And real is better
than perfect.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.165
Holly, look at him.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.918
This guy loves you.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.296
He's always gonna love you.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.756
Even when I loved you,
he loved you.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.509
But I digress.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.096
Henry, you're so smart.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.307
If I didn't date you
and break up with you

14:51.390 --> 14:52.766
and then date you
and break up with you

14:52.850 --> 14:55.311
I would so date you again.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.479
Well, I'm sorry, kid.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.064
I'm not available.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.816
Remember, I got me
another Holly.

15:00.899 --> 15:02.985
And she's a lucky girl.

15:03.068 --> 15:03.986
Oh, God.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.904
Henry, you're the best!

15:05.988 --> 15:07.531
Oh.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.078
[instrumental music]

15:22.087 --> 15:24.131
[knocking on door]

15:28.469 --> 15:30.346
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.973
Oh, how sweet,
you brought me a broccoli.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.683
[chuckles]
Great.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.685
I am gonna make you dinner.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.605
I thought I'd show off
my culinary skills.

15:39.688 --> 15:42.483
Here, i-i-in this place,
just the two of us?

15:42.566 --> 15:44.068
No buffer of other people?

15:45.402 --> 15:47.988
I thought maybe a little,
uh, chicken scaloppini

15:48.072 --> 15:49.698
'with some sauteed broccoli'

15:49.782 --> 15:51.784
and to top it off..

15:51.867 --> 15:55.120
...I have a '95 Burgundy.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.998
Wow, that ain't
your Boone's farm.

15:59.625 --> 16:03.003
Okay, uh, just so we're clear

16:03.087 --> 16:05.381
even though we're having
this very intimate dinner

16:05.464 --> 16:08.300
here in my house,
just the two of us..

16:08.384 --> 16:11.220
This is just
a get-to-know-you dinner.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.429
- Cool.
- Okay.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.974
Talking, eating, feet on floor.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.142
Cutting board?

16:17.226 --> 16:18.894
Over there, top drawer.

16:18.977 --> 16:20.771
Uh, yeah, so what
happened in high school

16:20.854 --> 16:22.648
that was just a one-time
thing, really.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.401
Ah, It was just one
desperate, confused night.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.986
- Yeah. Garlic?
- Uh, pink bowl.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.405
[clears throat]

16:29.488 --> 16:32.199
So, uh, just to..

16:32.282 --> 16:35.369
...reiterate, um..

16:35.452 --> 16:38.080
This is just a get-to-know-you
dinner, alright?

16:38.163 --> 16:39.373
And if it goes well

16:39.456 --> 16:40.582
then maybe somewhere
down the road

16:40.666 --> 16:41.917
I will feel comfortable enough

16:42.000 --> 16:44.628
to explore my physical
boundaries with you.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.132
Which one of these knobs
gets your oven hot?

16:48.215 --> 16:49.925
I beg..

16:50.008 --> 16:51.301
I beg..

16:51.385 --> 16:54.054
I beg your pardon?

16:54.138 --> 16:57.224
Oh, yeah, the one on
the right, there.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.476
It's just been a while
since I used it.

17:04.231 --> 17:07.651
Okay, okay, you tell me
this didn't mean something.

17:07.734 --> 17:09.944
I'm Holly, you're Henry.

17:10.028 --> 17:11.696
Now, come here.

17:16.034 --> 17:17.327
Wait, okay, that's it?

17:17.411 --> 17:19.913
That's what you consider
a romantic hug?

17:19.997 --> 17:21.457
Dude, that could've
just been saying goodbye

17:21.540 --> 17:23.625
or saying hello or saying
"It's good to see you."

17:23.709 --> 17:25.586
What the hell
is wrong with you?

17:25.669 --> 17:26.753
I don't know.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.839
Never felt this way
about a girl before.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.300
Then just don't stand around
and guess what's happening.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.552
Go to Henry, find out
what's really going on

17:33.635 --> 17:35.137
and if they're not together

17:35.220 --> 17:37.055
then do what you
set out to do.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.432
Be a man!

17:38.515 --> 17:42.102
Take that woman in your arms,
and you tell her

17:42.186 --> 17:44.980
"I love you."

17:49.943 --> 17:52.362
Beat it, this bitch is mine.

17:54.281 --> 17:57.367
[instrumental music]

18:01.580 --> 18:02.956
Hmm.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.589
This is the best
tiramisu I ever had.

18:10.672 --> 18:13.509
I love a woman who's not
ashamed to eat like a pig.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.595
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:16.678 --> 18:18.764
I don't usually do
that on a first date.

18:18.847 --> 18:21.642
Yeah, well, tonight was
a little unusual for both of us.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.936
I mean, I can never remember
being on a date

18:24.019 --> 18:25.896
and making so much..

18:25.979 --> 18:26.939
What's the word?

18:27.022 --> 18:29.608
Conversation.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.777
Yes, it was amazing.

18:31.860 --> 18:32.945
Hmm.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.738
Yeah, so tell me.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.032
How does it feel
knowing that, um

18:37.115 --> 18:39.535
you're the first girl
that I didn't have sex with

18:39.618 --> 18:41.537
on the first date?

18:41.620 --> 18:43.622
Oh, what a feather in my cap.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.043
Well, I'm gonna thank you
for making my first time, uh..

18:48.126 --> 18:49.920
...incredible.

18:50.003 --> 18:51.797
Look, I-I hate to leave but

18:51.880 --> 18:53.465
I got an early job
in the morning.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.717
No!

18:55.801 --> 18:57.553
Uh, I mean..

18:57.636 --> 18:58.720
Well, look at that.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.222
It's only, uh

19:00.305 --> 19:01.682
midnight, wow.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.392
Hm, come on, walk me
to the door.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.768
Okay.

19:04.852 --> 19:07.437
Um, you know all that stuff
I was saying before

19:07.521 --> 19:10.315
about taking it slow and
getting to know each other

19:10.399 --> 19:13.151
somewhere down the road,
blah, blah, blah?

19:14.111 --> 19:15.320
Well, um

19:15.404 --> 19:17.948
I feel like we really
got to know each other

19:18.031 --> 19:18.949
pretty good.

19:19.032 --> 19:20.450
Yeah, but, you know, I feel

19:20.534 --> 19:23.495
that there's so much more
to get to know about you.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.497
Oh, no.
Mmh-mm.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.082
You'd be surprised
how little there is

19:27.165 --> 19:29.501
to know about ol' Val.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.753
I can't wait to find out more.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.547
When, uh..

19:34.506 --> 19:36.091
...you do, uh, when we do

19:36.174 --> 19:37.593
it will be incredible.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.888
Well, you can count on that.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.558
Uh..

19:44.641 --> 19:47.102
- Goodnight, Val.
- Goodnight, Todd.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.447
I'll call you.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.865
When?

20:02.201 --> 20:05.370
You do, uh..

20:05.454 --> 20:08.540
...leave a message at the beep
and I will call you back.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.088
[sighs]

20:15.172 --> 20:17.090
[instrumental music]

20:23.764 --> 20:26.516
[laughter]

20:33.774 --> 20:35.901
(Henry)
'I'm so glad you're here.'

20:40.739 --> 20:42.574
I love you, Holly.

20:45.118 --> 20:48.038

21:10.143 --> 21:12.896
[theme music]
