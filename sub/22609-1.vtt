32:12.162 --> 32:14.366
-You feel what I'm sayin'?
-She don't usually smoke, man.

32:15.366 --> 32:18.303
She don't...
What, you baby lungs? (LAUGHS)

32:19.303 --> 32:23.707
I'm gonna help you out, too.
Let's go. Pull-pull-pull.

32:23.707 --> 32:25.576

32:25.576 --> 32:27.715

32:30.715 --> 32:32.284
It's that shit.

32:33.284 --> 32:35.053

-Yeah.

32:36.053 --> 32:37.429

I think I'm having

33:07.952 --> 33:10.389

a fuckin' heart attack.

33:11.389 --> 33:13.559

33:14.559 --> 33:16.227
Hey, yo, don't quit
your day job, now.

33:17.227 --> 33:19.364
That was so fucking
embarrassing.

33:20.364 --> 33:24.035
I just wanted to be down.
I fucked up.

33:43.621 --> 33:45.789
Don't worry about it.
Get some rest.

They're gonna call me.

34:37.275 --> 34:39.510
All right. Well, you really
need to let me cut that hair.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.145
I think that look
is holding you back.

34:41.145 --> 34:42.149

34:45.149 --> 34:48.219
-Holy shit, Ma, is this you?
-Yeah.

34:49.219 --> 34:51.589
I found it in the basement
while I was cleaning up

34:51.589 --> 34:52.224
for the garage sale.

34:53.224 --> 34:56.261
<i>That's our demo, Tuff Love.
That's my band, Barb Wire.</i>

34:57.261 --> 34:59.530
-Your hair was so big.
-Oh, yeah.

34:59.530 --> 35:01.032
"The higher the hair,
the closer to God."

35:02.032 --> 35:03.368
That's what they said.

35:04.368 --> 35:06.970
But your Nana said that
I looked and sounded like

35:06.970 --> 35:08.773
a two-bit tramp. So...

35:09.773 --> 35:12.076
Uh-uh.
It sounds awesome.

35:12.076 --> 35:14.445
-We were fuckin' great, right?
-Yeah...

35:14.445 --> 35:15.712
-Right?
-You look great.

35:15.712 --> 35:17.548
-It sounds great.
-We were gonna be huge.

35:17.548 --> 35:19.216
Everybody was tryin'
to sign us.

35:19.216 --> 35:22.653
I mean,
we were so fuckin' close.

35:23.653 --> 35:27.491
But your father
and his Midas fucking touch

35:27.491 --> 35:29.593
had to shit on my picnic.

35:29.593 --> 35:33.966
I mean, you can't be pregnant
in leather. No. No.

35:35.966 --> 35:38.269
I mean, I was just a baby.

35:39.269 --> 35:42.239
Your Pop-Pop made us
go to the town hall.

35:42.239 --> 35:44.241
And you were kicking through
the whole ceremony.

35:44.241 --> 35:45.243

<i>-BARB: Ma, you all right?
-NANA: I'm fine.</i>

36:06.196 --> 36:07.300
You know, Ma seems depressed.

36:09.300 --> 36:10.901
She's so out of it lately.

36:10.901 --> 36:13.738
Maybe she's got like,
early "Old Timers" or something.

36:13.738 --> 36:16.407
-It's Alzheimer's, Ma.
-Alzheimer's.

36:16.407 --> 36:18.074
She's also on a shit-ton
of painkillers.

36:18.074 --> 36:20.210
Well, I want you to spend
a little more time with her.

36:20.210 --> 36:21.778
All right?

36:21.778 --> 36:23.714
You know, take her out during
the day when I'm at work,

36:23.714 --> 36:25.549
maybe get her away
from the television.

36:25.549 --> 36:27.985
-Let her live a little bit.
-Ma, I'm busy.

36:27.985 --> 36:29.887
-You're busy?
-I'm grindin'.

36:29.887 --> 36:31.523
What the fuck is grindin'?

36:32.523 --> 36:34.725
Focusing on my music,
you know?

36:34.725 --> 36:35.029
Your music?

36:39.029 --> 36:40.265
Your music?

36:41.265 --> 36:43.500
Since when
do you do music, honey?

36:43.500 --> 36:45.436
You don't have a musical bone
in your body,

36:45.436 --> 36:47.370
and you sure as hell
can't sing.

36:47.370 --> 36:49.973
What kinda music
are we talkin' about here?

36:49.973 --> 36:52.444
Well, I've been rapping.

36:53.444 --> 36:55.545
-Rapping?
-Rhyming, MC-ing, you know?

36:55.545 --> 36:56.747
Really?

36:56.747 --> 36:59.116
Jheri and I just booked
our first recording session.

36:59.116 --> 37:01.451
(scoffs)
What's your rap singer name?

37:01.451 --> 37:03.488
What are you, like, Dewey
Dewey Dumbdrops or some shit?

37:04.488 --> 37:05.956
Hmm?

37:05.956 --> 37:07.858
I'm actually going as Killa P.

37:07.858 --> 37:10.794
Ooh, Killa P. Oh, shit.

37:10.794 --> 37:13.030
And what do ya kill, honey?
What do you fuckin' kill?

37:14.030 --> 37:15.366
I murder the beat.

37:15.366 --> 37:17.868
Oh, my God, my daughter,
the Son o' Sam.

37:17.868 --> 37:19.736
-Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
-I'm serious, Ma.

37:19.736 --> 37:21.138
-You're serious?
-Yeah, I'm serious.

37:21.138 --> 37:22.439
Okay, what're you doin'?

37:22.439 --> 37:24.108
You out there doin' drivebys,
doin' shoot-'em-ups?

37:24.108 --> 37:25.242
-Fuck you.
-Is that where you go?

37:25.242 --> 37:26.476
Fuck me? Fuck you!

37:26.476 --> 37:28.945

Now, I know why Dad left.

37:28.945 --> 37:31.782

-Wait. Jheri, get back here.

44:10.614 --> 44:13.684
Look, what about that track
I heard you messin' with before?

44:13.684 --> 44:16.519

44:26.563 --> 44:27.030
Okay, okay.

44:28.030 --> 44:31.635
So let's get rid of all the shit
and just keep the beat. Yeah?

44:31.635 --> 44:32.504
Can you do that?

44:33.504 --> 44:35.238

44:35.238 --> 44:36.440
Okay.

44:37.440 --> 44:41.078
