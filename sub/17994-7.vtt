00:36.473 --> 00:40.633
There is a force sufficiently powerful
to move the oceans of this world

01:08.823 --> 01:12.982
It is a force, not of this earth

01:16.131 --> 01:19.257
The moon is large enough
to generate gravity

01:19.258 --> 01:23.427
and with sufficient force
to pull on the earth,

01:23.428 --> 01:27.598
two hundred and thirty
thousand miles away

01:28.651 --> 01:32.811
As the moon orbits the earth its gravity
sweeps across the face of our planet

01:34.917 --> 01:39.077
Its power drags a great bulge of oceanic
water in its wake

01:47.438 --> 01:51.597
- the rising tide

01:53.693 --> 01:57.863
The River Amazon in Brazil

01:58.916 --> 02:02.042
On some special days the
gravitational forces

02:02.043 --> 02:06.203
of the moon and the sun pull together
- to extraordinary effect

02:13.522 --> 02:17.692
A growing tidal wave from the ocean
is being forced two hundred miles inland

02:21.872 --> 02:26.032
This is a tidal bore

03:03.615 --> 03:05.699
Fortunately tidal bores are rare,

03:05.700 --> 03:09.879
but the moon does create strong
tides out in the world's oceans,

03:09.880 --> 03:14.040
on every day of the year

03:20.316 --> 03:24.476
The Bay of Fundy, in Nova Scotia

03:27.614 --> 03:29.708
The tides here are
the largest in the world

03:29.709 --> 03:33.869
and have a profound effect on marine life,
creating a rich feeding ground

03:40.145 --> 03:44.304
A feast that attracts some of the
largest diners on the planet

03:54.751 --> 03:58.910
Humpback whales

03:59.963 --> 04:04.133
But they are not the biggest
threat to the herring

04:17.707 --> 04:20.833
These are finback whales

04:20.834 --> 04:25.014
At seventy tonnes - the second
largest animal on earth,

04:25.015 --> 04:29.175
but so beautifully streamlined that
it is the fastest of the great whales

04:32.323 --> 04:35.450
This combination of
speed and immense size

04:35.451 --> 04:39.610
makes the finback a voracious
hunter of schooling fish

04:42.759 --> 04:46.928
The Bay of Fundy can attract so many fish,
that during the summer,

04:46.929 --> 04:51.088
as many as five hundred of these
magnificent whales hunt here every day

04:56.322 --> 05:00.482
The feeding is best where
the tides run strongly

05:01.535 --> 05:04.672
So the whales move
further into the bay,

05:04.673 --> 05:08.832
following tidal rips
and searching for fish

05:16.151 --> 05:20.310
Their movements are closely watched
by flocks of Cory Shearwaters

05:25.544 --> 05:27.628
As the whales dive down
toward the fish

05:27.629 --> 05:31.789
- more and more birds gather,
anxious to pick up scraps

05:46.415 --> 05:48.499
The flowing tide may provide
a feast for the whales,

05:48.500 --> 05:52.660
but before long it will turn

05:55.808 --> 05:59.977
In just six hours,
one hundred billion tonnes of water

05:59.978 --> 06:04.147
will flow out of the bay

06:04.148 --> 06:07.285
The sea level falling
by as much as 15 metres

06:07.286 --> 06:11.446
and exposing vast tracts
of mud... and sand

06:13.542 --> 06:17.712
At first sight a barren place,
entirely devoid of life

06:22.935 --> 06:27.114
In fact, the damp sand is
packed with microscopic life

06:27.115 --> 06:30.242
- the meiofauna,
feeding in a sandy underworld,

06:30.243 --> 06:34.402
quite unaffected by
the departure of the sea

06:38.593 --> 06:42.753
But life is not all roses
in this miniature world

06:44.849 --> 06:49.019
A sand bubbler crab - in Northern
Australia - it hunts meiofauna

06:51.114 --> 06:55.274
Just a centimetre across, the sand
bubbler works at breakneck speed,

06:56.327 --> 06:58.421
passing sand grains
into its mouth,

06:58.422 --> 07:02.582
filtering out all the meiofauna
and kicking aside the waste

07:07.805 --> 07:11.975
The crab will clean every grain of
sand within a metre of its burrow

07:15.113 --> 07:19.273
Endless practise for the best back
heel in the Natural World

07:41.207 --> 07:45.376
The crabs work fast because they can
only sieve when the sand is damp

07:45.377 --> 07:48.504
Remarkably, they work the entire
surface of the beach

07:48.505 --> 07:52.675
within just a couple of hours
of the tide retreating

07:59.983 --> 08:04.153
Then they simply return to their
burrows and await the next tide

08:12.514 --> 08:16.674
Underwater a falling tide is the
cue for some bizarre activity

08:21.907 --> 08:25.034
These slow moving clams
use their muscular feet

08:25.035 --> 08:29.195
to bury themselves under the sand

08:30.248 --> 08:32.342
If they fail to get under cover,

08:32.342 --> 08:36.503
the tide will leave them exposed
to the air and they will perish

08:39.640 --> 08:43.820
But once underground they can
wait deep down in the sand,

08:43.821 --> 08:47.981
safe beneath the beach

08:51.119 --> 08:55.289
And not a moment too soon

08:56.342 --> 09:00.511
June in Southeast Alaska
and in just four hours

09:00.512 --> 09:04.682
a vast sandy beach is exposed
by the falling tide

09:11.990 --> 09:15.127
The bears are hungry
- at this time of year

09:15.128 --> 09:19.288
the pickings on land
are few and far between

09:20.341 --> 09:24.500
But any food here has long since
buried itself deep under the sand

09:30.776 --> 09:33.903
To a hungry adult bear
that is no barrier

09:33.904 --> 09:38.074
- they smell the clams through
the sand and simply dig them out

09:42.255 --> 09:45.392
For such large animals,
they show quite extraordinary dexterity

09:45.393 --> 09:49.552
at opening the unfortunate
shellfish

10:08.349 --> 10:12.509
Cubs try their luck, too,
none too successfully!

10:18.785 --> 10:22.944
But for the adults the shellfish feast
lasts as long as the tide remains out

10:29.220 --> 10:33.380
Table Mountain in South Africa

10:37.571 --> 10:41.731
Every day the retreating waves leave
flotsam somewhere on the beach...

10:42.783 --> 10:46.943
...and this creature is scenting the
currents for the odour of rotting fish

10:50.092 --> 10:54.251
The tide carries the scent
far into the surf zone

10:57.389 --> 11:01.559
Responding to the smell,
snails emerge from the sand

11:08.878 --> 11:13.037
This is a race against the tide
- the snails need to find their meal

11:14.090 --> 11:18.260
before the tide leaves it
beyond their reach

11:18.261 --> 11:22.431
But snails are slow and
the tides fall rapidly

11:25.569 --> 11:29.728
These, however,
are no ordinary snails

11:30.792 --> 11:34.951
They can surf!

11:58.961 --> 12:02.098
They ride the waves up
the beach but all too soon

12:02.099 --> 12:06.258
the tide leaves the fish
beyond the surf zone

12:13.577 --> 12:17.746
Without the sea there's a danger
that the snails will lose the scent,

12:17.747 --> 12:21.907
but as long as the sand remains damp they
can still follow a faint trail to the food

12:27.140 --> 12:31.300
Once there they tuck in
with macabre relish

12:39.661 --> 12:43.831
Good things come to
those who wait!

12:56.362 --> 12:58.446
Before long the heat
of the sun forces them

12:58.447 --> 13:02.607
to retreat into the sand to
await the return of the next tide

13:09.925 --> 13:12.009
February in Britain

13:12.010 --> 13:16.180
The falling tide is eagerly
awaited by these knot

13:41.232 --> 13:45.412
As the water retreats
countless small invertebrates

13:45.413 --> 13:49.572
are seeking shelter under the mud

13:51.668 --> 13:55.827
And with good reason

14:10.454 --> 14:13.581
Waders are specialists
at probing in the mud,

14:13.582 --> 14:16.719
their wide variety of beak
shapes designed

14:16.720 --> 14:18.804
for reaching different
invertebrate dinners

14:18.805 --> 14:22.964
Keys that unlock the safety
of the tidal flats

14:35.495 --> 14:39.665
But within a few hours
the tide will turn again

14:51.154 --> 14:53.238
Soon the waders are out
of their depth

14:53.239 --> 14:57.399
and the creatures of the mud
are safe once more

15:02.632 --> 15:06.792
Underwater incoming tides
can create a strong current

15:07.845 --> 15:12.015
And flounder are experts
at hitching a tidal lift

15:15.153 --> 15:19.313
They are shaped rather like a kite
- a perfect design for gliding on the tide

15:23.504 --> 15:26.630
In Newfoundland on the
East Coast of Canada,

15:26.631 --> 15:30.801
large numbers of flounder ride
the currents up into the shallows

15:36.024 --> 15:40.184
They have come to hunt invertebrates that
will emerge now that the water is back

16:01.076 --> 16:05.236
The pickings in the shallows
can be very good

16:07.331 --> 16:11.491
The activity has
not gone unnoticed

16:14.639 --> 16:18.799
But Ospreys can't dive deeply

16:22.990 --> 16:27.150
As long as the water is more than a meter
deep, the found then will be safe

16:39.681 --> 16:43.851
Going too far inshore
can be a risky business

16:53.254 --> 16:57.414
This fish buries itself completely
in the sand at any sign of danger

16:59.509 --> 17:03.689
But when the tide floods in again,
as long as the coast is clear

17:03.690 --> 17:07.849
- these sand lancet will re-emerge

17:16.211 --> 17:20.380
After a wait of six hours under the sand,
they are desperate for food and,

17:20.381 --> 17:24.540
unlike flounder,
they head out to sea

17:25.604 --> 17:27.688
They are looking for
shallow open water,

17:27.689 --> 17:31.849
where the tidal currents will
concentrate their food - plankton

17:40.210 --> 17:44.369
In their untold thousand they stream
toward the best feeding grounds

17:45.433 --> 17:49.592
Where they simply pick up
tiny planktonic creatures from the water

18:01.081 --> 18:04.207
But, if they swim too far off-shore
in search of food,

18:04.208 --> 18:08.379
they risk running into large predators
that live out in deeper water

18:12.559 --> 18:16.719
Dogfish - small sharks

18:18.825 --> 18:22.984
The sand lancet have strayed out
of their safe depth

19:24.566 --> 19:28.726
The effect of the turning tide can
be totally different on a rocky shore

19:37.087 --> 19:41.257
Here on the coast of Vancouver Island
in Canada the sun bakes the exposed rock

19:43.352 --> 19:47.521
It's virtually impossible to dig
underground when the sea retreats,

19:47.522 --> 19:51.702
so these mussels and barnacles are
fully exposed to the heat of the sun

19:51.703 --> 19:55.863
- literally cooking
in their own shells

19:59.001 --> 20:03.171
And the seaweed simply dry to a crisp

20:08.394 --> 20:12.564
It can be a wait of many hours
before the water returns

20:16.744 --> 20:20.904
Throughout each month the size
and strength of the tide changes

20:23.010 --> 20:25.094
The biggest tides of all happen

20:25.095 --> 20:28.222
when the gravities of the
sun and moon pull in unison

20:28.223 --> 20:32.382
That happens immediately
after the new moon...

20:33.446 --> 20:37.605
...and again after the full moon

20:41.786 --> 20:44.923
These are called the spring tides

20:44.924 --> 20:49.083
They reveal vast tracts of sea bed
that would normally be covered

20:53.274 --> 20:57.434
For these racoons it's a chance
to look for a seafood feast

20:59.529 --> 21:03.689
A mother ventures forth with her kits

21:04.752 --> 21:07.879
With the spring tide, they've
come further down the beach

21:07.880 --> 21:12.040
than smaller tides would normally allow

21:21.443 --> 21:25.623
Searching with their
extraordinarily sensitive paws

21:25.624 --> 21:27.708
- they look for suitable prey

21:27.709 --> 21:31.869
With the extreme low tide they
could find something special

21:47.538 --> 21:51.697
And what could be better
than a red rock crab

21:53.793 --> 21:57.963
That is, if it weren't for the risk
of a painful pinch

22:03.186 --> 22:07.365
With large crabs
there's no substitute for experience

22:07.366 --> 22:11.526
- the mother makes an expert's catch

22:18.845 --> 22:23.004
But the kits learn fast!

22:27.195 --> 22:31.355
And for those that don't
- begging is always worth a try!

22:36.578 --> 22:40.748
All too soon the returning tide
will cover the racoon's table

22:49.109 --> 22:51.193
For all the invertebrates
it is a welcome relief,

22:51.194 --> 22:55.354
but in rough weather they are
exposed to the worst of the waves

23:39.192 --> 23:42.329
Even when there are no waves
- the incoming tide

23:42.330 --> 23:45.456
can create considerable forces underwater

23:45.457 --> 23:48.584
The gaps between these small islands on

23:48.585 --> 23:52.755
the East coast of Vancouver
Island channel the tidal flow

23:53.808 --> 23:56.935
As the tide keeps rising,
gradually the water flows

23:56.936 --> 24:01.115
faster and soon these giant thirty metre

24:01.116 --> 24:05.276
long bull kelp plants bend to the current

24:17.807 --> 24:20.933
They are sufficiently flexible
to cope without too much damage,

24:20.934 --> 24:25.105
but there are some spots where
the currents are especially powerful

24:28.242 --> 24:31.369
This is the Nakwakto Rapids

24:31.370 --> 24:35.550
At the turn of the tide,
water from almost seven hundred miles

24:35.551 --> 24:38.677
of coastal fjords will have
to empty through a gap

24:38.678 --> 24:41.805
of less than half a mile wide

24:41.806 --> 24:45.985
Within a few minutes the current
is already picking up speed,

24:45.986 --> 24:50.146
until water roars by at over
seventeen miles per hour

25:29.814 --> 25:33.974
Tidal currents are not always
a damaging force

25:35.037 --> 25:38.163
- here in the Poor Knight
Islands of New Zealand,

25:38.164 --> 25:40.249
weak tides run through rock arches,

25:40.250 --> 25:44.409
making an ideal resting
place for stingrays

25:54.855 --> 25:59.025
These rays congregate here
in huge numbers every March

26:00.078 --> 26:04.238
- they've come to breed

26:08.429 --> 26:12.598
The arches funnel the current,
which the rays can ride

26:12.599 --> 26:16.759
with a minimum of effort,
so saving energy

26:26.162 --> 26:30.342
Nearby, out in open water,
a school of two spotted desmoiselle fish

26:30.343 --> 26:33.469
are feeding on plankton
and the current

26:33.470 --> 26:37.630
is perfect for sweeping
their food past them

26:50.172 --> 26:52.256
Once the current starts to weaken,

26:52.257 --> 26:55.383
there is insufficient food to
warrant the risks of swimming

26:55.384 --> 26:58.521
about out here in the open

26:58.522 --> 27:02.682
So the desmoiselles head off
to find shelter en-masse

27:03.735 --> 27:07.894
Safety is in numbers

27:15.213 --> 27:19.392
More and more desmoiselles pour
towards the cave entrances

27:19.393 --> 27:23.553
that riddle the Poor
Knight's islands

27:51.743 --> 27:54.869
Safe at last - inside the cave

27:54.870 --> 27:59.030
they are far less exposed
to attack from predators

28:02.179 --> 28:06.338
Thousands of desmoiselles and blue mao mao
wait for the return of the current,

28:07.391 --> 28:11.551
when once again they will
head out into the open to feed

28:18.869 --> 28:23.039
The moon's gravitational pull
is weaker nearer to the earth's equator,

28:24.092 --> 28:28.252
so the more equatorial the location,
the smaller the tides

28:29.305 --> 28:33.475
And out here in the Caribbean Sea
the tidal movements are slight

28:35.571 --> 28:39.730
Even so, they are sufficient to push
free swimming plankton in their path

28:44.964 --> 28:49.123
These are thimble jellyfish

28:50.176 --> 28:53.313
They swim towards the sunlight
and invisible boundaries

28:53.314 --> 28:57.483
formed by the tidal motion
help to herd them together,

28:57.484 --> 29:01.653
until they gather in immense swarms

29:01.654 --> 29:04.791
They put the tropical
sunshine to good use

29:04.792 --> 29:06.877
- their brown colour
comes from algae that

29:06.878 --> 29:11.037
live inside the jellyfish's bodies
and photosynthesise energy from the sun

29:24.621 --> 29:26.705
In open water they
are fairly safe,

29:26.706 --> 29:30.866
but the tide is sweeping the whole
swarm gently towards the Bahamas,

29:31.919 --> 29:36.089
where hungry mouths are waiting

29:41.312 --> 29:43.396
Although the sea level
does not change much

29:43.397 --> 29:47.577
- the tides are still pushing
an enormous volume of water

29:47.578 --> 29:51.737
from the ocean through the
small gaps between the island cays

30:03.226 --> 30:07.396
Underwater the tidal currents
race past soft corals

30:13.662 --> 30:17.832
And on over the sandy
banks themselves...

30:23.055 --> 30:27.214
It is an immense area of coral sand
that is only just submerged at high tide

30:31.405 --> 30:35.565
This incoming tide is bringing
in a fresh supply of oceanic plankton

30:36.618 --> 30:40.788
and razorfish gather at the best spots
to catch the pick of the microscopic feast

30:48.106 --> 30:50.191
Although there is plenty here
for these small fish to eat,

30:50.192 --> 30:54.351
gathering in one place makes it
easy for their predators to find them

30:59.585 --> 31:03.744
A nurse shark is little threat

31:05.840 --> 31:10.010
But this sound heralds
a quite different danger

31:25.669 --> 31:29.828
A bottlenose dolphin

31:31.934 --> 31:36.094
It's using its sonar to locate
razor fish beneath the sand

31:45.497 --> 31:49.657
Once it finds a suitable target
it simply digs out its prey

32:28.282 --> 32:31.409
The buried fish have no defence
against this attack

32:31.410 --> 32:35.580
They will simply have to wait
and hope they aren't found out

32:51.239 --> 32:55.409
This dolphin appears to have a razor
fish craving - well, she is pregnant

33:07.940 --> 33:12.100
Success, at last

33:23.588 --> 33:25.683
The incoming tide sweeps
on towards America,

33:25.684 --> 33:29.843
flooding across vast flat
plains of seagrass

33:30.896 --> 33:32.980
They are so shallow that,
at low tide,

33:32.981 --> 33:37.152
all large fish are forced
to retreat into deep water channels

33:38.204 --> 33:42.364
Like these nurse sharks...
and these stingrays

33:44.460 --> 33:48.639
Both predators hunt crustaceans
on the seagrass beds,

33:48.640 --> 33:52.809
but until the flooding tide brings
enough water for them to swim in,

33:52.810 --> 33:56.980
they will have to wait

34:02.203 --> 34:06.383
So for now this tulip
snail it appears safe

34:06.384 --> 34:09.510
to patrol the shallows
in search of a meal

34:09.511 --> 34:13.670
But is it?

34:19.947 --> 34:24.116
This I s a rather
bigger kind of snail

34:24.117 --> 34:27.254
At five kilogrammes in weight,
the giant horse conch

34:27.255 --> 34:31.415
has little to fear from any shark...
and it has a taste for tulip snail

34:41.860 --> 34:46.021
Sensing the approaching danger
- the snail flees

34:48.126 --> 34:52.286
But in a world of snail paces
- the conch is something of a Ferrari

34:55.424 --> 34:59.594
It calls for desperate measures

35:00.647 --> 35:02.731
Exhausted by the effort
of its last ditch attempt,

35:02.732 --> 35:06.892
the tulip snail is slowly gunned down

35:15.253 --> 35:19.413
The tide still has to rise for another
hour before the big predators can feed

35:21.518 --> 35:25.678
But out on the flats the scent of
dying snail wafts away on the tide

35:28.816 --> 35:32.986
It's a scent that these hermit crabs
are particularly partial to

35:37.167 --> 35:40.304
It's vital that the crabs have
the best possible protection

35:40.305 --> 35:44.464
from the heavy teeth of
the waiting sharks and rays

35:46.560 --> 35:50.739
For that they need the shell
with a perfect fit

35:50.740 --> 35:53.867
Today there is new real
estate on offer

35:53.868 --> 35:58.028
- and competition in this
housing market is fierce

36:23.090 --> 36:25.174
The action becomes even
more desperate

36:25.175 --> 36:29.335
when the shell of the devoured
snail is ready for release

36:40.823 --> 36:44.993
This crab simply can't
wait any longer

36:48.131 --> 36:52.291
But it's a decidedly
risky acquisition

36:56.482 --> 36:59.608
The risk paid off handsomely
- the new shell is both lighter

36:59.609 --> 37:03.789
and stronger than the old home
and it's not a moment too soon

37:03.790 --> 37:07.950
because the tide is flowing in strongly,
flooding the plains

37:11.088 --> 37:15.258
At last, the predators are free
to start their foraging

37:24.661 --> 37:28.830
Both the stingrays and sharks have
a highly developed electrical sense

37:28.831 --> 37:31.958
which they use to search
for buried invertebrates

37:31.959 --> 37:36.129
- they can sense minute
movements beneath the sand

37:40.310 --> 37:43.436
Finding a promising signal,
this ray digs out its meal,

37:43.437 --> 37:47.607
an unprotected hermit crab
would have no chance

37:55.968 --> 37:59.095
Within a few hours the tide
ebbs out once more,

37:59.096 --> 38:03.255
and all the predators
are forced to leave

38:08.489 --> 38:11.615
They will have to wait
until the next high tide

38:11.616 --> 38:15.776
before making another feeding foray

38:19.967 --> 38:23.094
At certain times of the
year called the equinox,

38:23.095 --> 38:27.254
spring tides are exceptionally large
and rise even higher than normal

38:30.403 --> 38:34.562
Now predators can reach the very
shallowest fringes of the seagrass flats

38:36.658 --> 38:40.828
These two metre long tarpon
are heading further inshore still

38:41.881 --> 38:46.041
They are heading for the mangroves

38:47.094 --> 38:51.264
These flooded forests cover huge
areas of the coastal shallows

38:54.402 --> 38:56.486
Extraordinarily, the roots
of the mangrove trees

38:56.487 --> 39:00.657
can live in salt water and they
make a perfect nursery for small fish

39:11.103 --> 39:15.262
Silversides and snapper find
sanctuary in the maze of roots

39:16.315 --> 39:20.486
- big predators seldom
find a way in here

39:26.751 --> 39:30.921
And now the tide is
falling once more

39:35.102 --> 39:38.228
The water starts losing
what little oxygen it contained

39:38.229 --> 39:42.399
and quickly becomes stagnant

39:44.495 --> 39:47.621
Most predators have
abandoned the mangroves,

39:47.622 --> 39:51.792
but these tarpon are still
here trapped by the falling tide

39:58.058 --> 40:01.195
The dissolved oxygen
is fast running out,

40:01.196 --> 40:05.356
but they have a vital
survival technique...

40:07.451 --> 40:11.611
...they can breathe air

40:21.014 --> 40:24.151
Pumped up with fresh oxygen
they can easily out

40:24.152 --> 40:28.312
manoeuvre the dozy silversides

40:50.236 --> 40:54.406
The tide has turned again

40:56.502 --> 40:58.586
And this is no ordinary tide

40:58.587 --> 41:02.756
Since it is the equinox
- the tide is rising fast

41:02.757 --> 41:06.927
but now out to sea a hurricane is on
its way, forcing the tide yet higher

41:40.330 --> 41:44.489
The passing storm leaves large areas
of the coast flooded by the sea...

41:49.723 --> 41:52.849
...and the low lying islands
like the Bahamas

41:52.850 --> 41:57.020
are even more prone
to storm flooding

41:58.073 --> 42:02.242
The sun's power here is immense

42:02.243 --> 42:06.423
As the tide recedes and the
remaining flood water evaporates

42:06.424 --> 42:10.584
- a remarkable transformation
takes place...

42:21.030 --> 42:25.189
The mud is coated with
a magical world of salt

42:35.635 --> 42:39.805
Any remaining water is extremely salty
- very few creatures can survive here...

42:41.901 --> 42:46.061
...except these brine shrimp

42:52.337 --> 42:56.496
And on the water's edge, brine flies

42:57.549 --> 43:01.719
Both are the favourite food
of an extraordinary animal

43:04.857 --> 43:09.017
The Caribbean Flamingo

43:11.123 --> 43:15.292
Remarkably, they actually
seek out such briny places

43:15.293 --> 43:19.453
- they are the best spots for
them to find their food

43:34.079 --> 43:38.239
And they also provide the protection
the flamingos need to raise their young

43:42.430 --> 43:45.556
Nesting sites like this are
surrounded by corrosive brine

43:45.557 --> 43:49.717
It's a formidable barrier to any predators
seeking to dine on flamingo chicks

43:55.993 --> 44:00.162
The Flamingo takes the precaution
of building next

44:00.163 --> 44:04.333
Just in case of further flatting

44:11.652 --> 44:14.778
Strangely, it's actually the
power of the storm tides

44:14.779 --> 44:17.906
that gives the flamingos
both their food

44:17.907 --> 44:22.066
and a perfect habitat in which to breed

44:35.651 --> 44:37.735
The breeding of many animals in the ocean

44:37.736 --> 44:41.905
is closely co-ordinated
with the tidal cycles

44:41.906 --> 44:46.076
A half moon in November.
It is the time for small tides.

44:53.394 --> 44:57.563
Christmas Island in the Pacific

44:57.564 --> 45:01.724
Strange happenings are afoot

45:08.000 --> 45:10.084
It is one of only a few nights each year

45:10.085 --> 45:14.245
when female Christmas Island crabs
risk heading down towards the sea

45:19.478 --> 45:23.647
Around the island they number
in tens of thousands

45:23.648 --> 45:27.818
and all of them are laden
with hundreds of eggs

45:29.914 --> 45:34.074
They have to shed them into the ocean
if the eggs are to develop into baby crabs

45:39.307 --> 45:43.467
But these are land crabs and they can
neither swim nor breathe underwater

45:58.093 --> 46:00.177
There is a great risk of drowning,

46:00.178 --> 46:03.305
which is why they pick the
smallest tides of the month

46:03.306 --> 46:07.476
- to minimise the danger

46:32.528 --> 46:36.697
The eggs will develop far
offshore and in exactly

46:36.698 --> 46:40.877
one month's time a great swarm
of baby crabs will return,

46:40.878 --> 46:45.038
again choosing the perfect tide

46:51.314 --> 46:54.441
Whether it's the daily or monthly cycle,

46:54.442 --> 46:58.621
tides are the rhythm of the ocean
- its pulsing clock

46:58.622 --> 47:02.782
For every tide brings opportunity
to marine life somewhere in the world

47:11.143 --> 47:15.302
Now a spring tide is flooding the
shallows and hunters are on the prowl

47:19.493 --> 47:23.662
A small group of bottlenose dolphin
are working their way

47:23.663 --> 47:27.823
inshore to start a quite
extraordinary hunting campaign

47:54.970 --> 47:59.130
After one successful pass the dolphin
move off to start again

48:01.236 --> 48:05.405
One animal peels off from the group
and swims rapidly in a circle,

48:05.406 --> 48:09.566
stirring up the mud and driving
the mullet towards the other waiting dolphins

48:14.799 --> 48:18.959
It's a remarkable team effort
and it is extremely effective

48:26.277 --> 48:29.404
The dolphin will feed like this
for as long as the tide grants

48:29.405 --> 48:33.575
them access to the shallows

49:21.583 --> 49:25.753
Eventually the falling tide will
force the dolphin to leave the flats

49:26.806 --> 49:30.966
and the mullet will be safe once more
- until the next high tide

49:36.199 --> 49:40.368
Because in the ocean every
turn of the tide spells

49:40.369 --> 49:44.529
the difference between
life and death, somewhere

49:45.305 --> 49:51.212
