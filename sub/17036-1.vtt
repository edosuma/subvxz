00:11.467 --> 00:15.233
Laura, I'll show
you to your desk.

00:41.967 --> 00:43.667
Well, you know what to do.

00:43.767 --> 00:44.667
Yeah.

00:51.133 --> 00:52.100
Gary, it's me.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.033
You're dumped.

00:53.133 --> 00:55.633
[theme music]

01:17.967 --> 01:19.433
So you're not gay?

01:19.533 --> 01:20.333
No.

01:25.633 --> 01:28.967
You're waiting for
something to clear up?

01:29.067 --> 01:30.700
No.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.933
It's OK if you've
got micro penis.

01:33.033 --> 01:34.200
I can work around it.

01:34.300 --> 01:36.400
My penis is fine, Meg.

01:36.500 --> 01:40.633
I just didn't think last night
felt like the right time, OK?

01:40.733 --> 01:42.300
You in a cult?

01:42.400 --> 01:46.800
Like I said several
times, I just want to wait.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.300
Yeah, but that
was 12 hours ago,

01:48.400 --> 01:52.767
so does that
constitute enough wait?

01:52.867 --> 01:56.200
That suits you, by the way.

01:56.300 --> 01:59.700
I should give you this back.

01:59.800 --> 02:02.633
Yeah.

02:02.733 --> 02:04.067
I really like you, Meg.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.000
I really like you too, Andrew.

02:06.100 --> 02:09.567
And it's not like I don't
find you extremely sexy.

02:09.667 --> 02:13.933
I just want our first
time to be special.

02:14.033 --> 02:16.100
Yeah, me too.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.100
I am not in any rush.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.900
I'll make us some
breakfast then.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.467
Eggs Royale, OK?

02:42.000 --> 02:42.900
Oh!

02:43.000 --> 02:46.467
Oh!

02:46.567 --> 02:48.467
[knock on door]

02:48.567 --> 02:49.633
Who goes there?

02:49.733 --> 02:50.533
SCOTT: It's Scott.

02:50.633 --> 02:51.467
I heard screaming.

02:51.567 --> 02:52.567
Is everything OK?

02:52.667 --> 02:53.900
Scotty, hi.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.167
Oh, my god.

02:55.267 --> 02:56.500
Seriously frightening
emergency situation.

02:56.600 --> 02:57.333
What happened?

02:57.433 --> 02:58.833
I was having my morning nap--

02:58.933 --> 03:00.067
Morning-- OK.

03:00.167 --> 03:04.733
And then I felt a
hand and then I saw her.

03:04.833 --> 03:06.533
It was the ghost
of Granny Primrose.

03:06.633 --> 03:08.233
OK, so everything's fine.

03:08.333 --> 03:10.767
No, what if I'm cursed
like in "The Ring?"

03:10.867 --> 03:11.900
OK.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.533
Well, that's not
going to happen so--

03:13.633 --> 03:14.667
But how do you know?

03:14.767 --> 03:18.333
Because curses aren't
real, and I don't know,

03:18.433 --> 03:19.433
maybe it was a good thing.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.000
Yes.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.300
Well, it's a sign.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.933
I mean, I always knew I
was special and gifted,

03:24.033 --> 03:25.800
but now you're telling
me I'm psychic.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.333
I didn't say you were psychic.

03:27.433 --> 03:29.767
I guess I always knew, but
I didn't know know, you know?

03:29.867 --> 03:31.267
Better get to work.

03:31.367 --> 03:33.767
When you have a gift, Scott,
it is your duty to share it.

03:33.867 --> 03:36.200
May I?

03:36.300 --> 03:37.867
Scotty, this is
very interesting.

03:37.967 --> 03:38.767
Yeah?

03:38.867 --> 03:39.700
Yeah.

03:39.800 --> 03:40.600
Patrick.

03:40.700 --> 03:42.500
Nathan.

03:42.600 --> 03:43.900
I'll try to remember
everyone's names.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.967
We're decorating
a bit for Halloween.

03:46.067 --> 03:47.500
Didn't want you to
be left out, so--

03:47.600 --> 03:48.800
Cheers.

03:48.900 --> 03:53.567
I thought my first day would
be scary enough, but blah.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.433
You do anything for it?

03:55.533 --> 03:57.633
For Halloween?

03:57.733 --> 03:58.833
Big time.

03:58.933 --> 04:00.700
I always go to my
mate's house party.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.567
It's legendary and sexy.

04:03.667 --> 04:05.267
It's pretty out of control.

04:05.367 --> 04:06.300
It's wild.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.100
Like me.

04:07.200 --> 04:10.067
You should come.

04:10.167 --> 04:11.633
All of you.

04:18.067 --> 04:21.100
So now we have to
have a Halloween party.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.300
We'll just put some
crackers in a bowl.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.733
Do a [inaudible] cauldron.

04:24.833 --> 04:26.133
get some of those
glow-in-the-dark

04:26.233 --> 04:28.700
skellys from the party shop,
hammer them to the wall.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.000
Bosh, it's party time.

04:30.100 --> 04:32.033
I think that might have
a pretty adverse effect

04:32.133 --> 04:33.433
on our tenancy agreement.

04:33.533 --> 04:34.733
OK, guys.

04:34.833 --> 04:37.167
I am really interested in
this, but me now, you won't

04:37.267 --> 04:39.033
believe this but I'm psychic.

04:39.133 --> 04:39.967
Yeah, you're right.

04:40.067 --> 04:41.200
I don't believe it.

04:41.300 --> 04:43.733
Meg, I saw the ghost
of Granny Primrose.

04:43.833 --> 04:44.967
Yeah.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.600
Granny Primrose is still alive.
- Is she?

04:46.700 --> 04:48.000
Yes.
She's alive.

04:48.100 --> 04:49.267
She just lives in
a nursing home,

04:49.367 --> 04:50.567
and you never go and see her.

04:50.667 --> 04:53.067
Well, in my dream,
she was definitely dead.

04:53.167 --> 04:56.033
So maybe that means
that she's going to die

04:56.133 --> 04:56.967
and I've predicted it.

04:57.067 --> 04:58.267
Well, she is 83.

04:58.367 --> 05:02.033
Put the point is, Meg,
I have a psychic gift.

05:02.133 --> 05:03.200
Scott said so.

05:03.300 --> 05:04.567
He was really impressed.

05:04.667 --> 05:05.500
Scott?

05:05.600 --> 05:07.500
We're not jealous,
are we, Meg?

05:07.600 --> 05:08.433
You've got Andrew now.

05:08.533 --> 05:09.167
Yeah, I know.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.167
Don't get me wrong.

05:10.267 --> 05:11.767
Andrew ticks all the boxes.

05:11.867 --> 05:12.700
Fit.

05:12.800 --> 05:13.700
Clever.

05:13.800 --> 05:14.833
Text me back on the same day.

05:14.933 --> 05:16.433
Has he ticked your
box though, Meg?

05:16.533 --> 05:17.600
Still no.

05:17.700 --> 05:18.533
Oh, Jesus.

05:18.633 --> 05:19.267
Meg.

05:19.367 --> 05:20.633
Isn't that like date four?

05:20.733 --> 05:22.000
Five.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.667
I think he's being a gentleman.

05:23.767 --> 05:25.133
What is enough?

05:25.233 --> 05:28.467
And I'm trying to be cool
about it, but OK, real talk.

05:28.567 --> 05:29.933
I'm on a new pill.

05:30.033 --> 05:30.867
Why are you whispering?

05:30.967 --> 05:32.267
It's just us.

05:32.367 --> 05:37.533
I'm on a new pill, and
it's making me very charged

05:37.633 --> 05:38.433
sexually.

05:38.533 --> 05:39.533
Soggy box?

05:39.633 --> 05:41.933
Yeah, I had rub one
out in his own suite.

05:42.033 --> 05:43.567
Now I've got that image.

05:43.667 --> 05:44.567
Right.

05:44.667 --> 05:46.267
It's time to bring
out the big guns.

05:46.367 --> 05:49.367
If he's playing hard to
get, you play it harder.

05:49.467 --> 05:54.567
Be demure, mysterious, coy.

05:54.667 --> 05:55.633
I can do that.

05:58.667 --> 06:00.033
Ugh.
All right.

06:00.133 --> 06:01.000
[inaudible]

06:01.100 --> 06:03.467
Sorry.

06:03.567 --> 06:05.533
Welcome to my house.

06:05.633 --> 06:08.533
Would you like to come
in for a night cap?

06:08.633 --> 06:11.467
Night cap is code for sex.

06:11.567 --> 06:12.633
Right.

06:12.733 --> 06:14.500
Sh.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.633
Hey, party people.

06:16.733 --> 06:17.633
Hello.

06:21.667 --> 06:23.333
Hi.
I'm Andrew.

06:23.433 --> 06:24.500
Bunny.
Hi.

06:24.600 --> 06:25.400
I'm starving.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.367
Is that a take?

06:26.467 --> 06:28.100
Did someone have a few drinks?

06:28.200 --> 06:29.600
Someone did.

06:29.700 --> 06:30.767
Yes.

06:30.867 --> 06:32.000
Do you want a
cheese stick, Andrew?

06:32.100 --> 06:33.300
No thanks.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.067
I'm sober.

06:34.167 --> 06:37.700
Oh, I do.

06:37.800 --> 06:38.933
What film is this?

06:39.033 --> 06:40.700
"[inaudible] Castle."

06:40.800 --> 06:41.633
It's murder.

06:41.733 --> 06:43.300
God, I hate these films.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.033
Pure patriarchal fantasy.

06:45.133 --> 06:47.400
If you ask me, fetishizing
violence against women,

06:47.500 --> 06:49.067
now that is the scariest
thing about Halloween.

06:49.167 --> 06:50.367
Do you know what I mean?

06:50.467 --> 06:51.833
What did you have for
dinner, a dictionary?

06:51.933 --> 06:53.367
Andrew is a feminist.

07:00.700 --> 07:03.433
Should I show you
the boudoir, Andrew?

07:03.533 --> 07:05.733
Are you going to OK
up the ladder, Meg?

07:05.833 --> 07:08.500
The ladder?

07:08.600 --> 07:11.667
MEG: I've seriously got
a five-star room rating.

07:11.767 --> 07:12.767
ANDREW: Probably not anymore.

07:12.867 --> 07:13.700
No.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.833
MEG: Come on.

07:14.933 --> 07:15.733
This way.

07:20.467 --> 07:23.700
Look, I know you want to wait,
but I think we should just

07:23.800 --> 07:25.600
shag now and get it over with.

07:25.700 --> 07:26.900
You're very drunk.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.067
Not that drunk.

07:29.167 --> 07:30.633
So you don't have to worry.

07:30.733 --> 07:32.433
It wouldn't be rape
because I'm up for it.

07:32.533 --> 07:33.467
I'm saying yes.

07:33.567 --> 07:34.900
Please have sex with me.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.233
Feel down here if
you don't believe me.

07:36.333 --> 07:37.633
I've got a well soggy box.
- OK.

07:37.733 --> 07:38.933
Yeah.
Wow.

07:39.033 --> 07:39.833
Yeah.

07:39.933 --> 07:41.400
Thank you.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.333
I'd better go.

07:42.433 --> 07:43.467
I've work in the morning.

07:43.567 --> 07:46.467
So do I. Big deal.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.733
Come here.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.300
Lie down.

08:14.067 --> 08:17.533
Oh, why are you tucking me in?

08:17.633 --> 08:18.667
Sweet dreams.

08:21.633 --> 08:23.467
Oh, don't go.

08:23.567 --> 08:25.400
Please.

Laura Wiley,
sign here, please.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.133
Sorry.

08:38.233 --> 08:39.667
Do you mind holding
for one moment?

08:39.767 --> 08:42.067
Just what the fuck
are you do here, Plank?

08:42.167 --> 08:43.333
I needed to see you.

08:43.433 --> 08:45.200
You can't just leave
without any explanation.

08:45.300 --> 08:47.867
I've told you, I'm
focusing on my career.

08:47.967 --> 08:49.700
Everything OK?
Who are you?

08:49.800 --> 08:51.000
I'm her boyfriend.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.900
Oh, I guess we'll be
seeing you at this epic

08:53.000 --> 08:54.133
Halloween party then?

08:54.233 --> 08:55.967
What epic Halloween party?

08:56.067 --> 08:57.133
You're not invited.

08:57.233 --> 08:58.833
I know what's
happening here, Laura.

08:58.933 --> 08:59.833
All these men are gorgeous.

08:59.933 --> 09:01.833
All right.
Gee.

09:01.933 --> 09:03.100
Please, Laura.

09:03.200 --> 09:06.067
Just get out before
I have you thrown out.

09:06.167 --> 09:07.000
Security!

09:07.100 --> 09:08.767
He's not a real courier.

09:08.867 --> 09:10.567
He's not my boyfriend.

09:10.667 --> 09:13.800
He's more like a stalker
that I barely know.

09:13.900 --> 09:15.400
So you coming to the party then?

09:15.500 --> 09:16.167
Yeah.

09:16.267 --> 09:17.533
I might come by later.

09:17.633 --> 09:19.733
Might?

09:19.833 --> 09:21.900
What time might you come?

09:22.000 --> 09:22.933
I'll text you.

09:23.033 --> 09:24.333
All right, back to, you.

09:24.433 --> 09:27.067
Let's sell the shit
out this broadband.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.433
Fucking might?

09:33.567 --> 09:34.800
Oh.

09:34.900 --> 09:35.800
Hi, Scott.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.367
Hi.

09:37.467 --> 09:40.567
I just want to say thank you
so much for enlightening me

09:40.667 --> 09:41.500
about my gift.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.233
Sorry?

09:42.333 --> 09:44.100
My psychic abilities.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.233
I'd love to repay the
favor if you let me.

09:46.333 --> 09:47.800
We're having a get together.

09:47.900 --> 09:49.267
On Friday night, yeah.

09:49.367 --> 09:51.800
Laura told me about this
slutty Halloween party.

09:51.900 --> 09:53.000
Oh, Laura.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.667
How uncouth.
No.

09:54.767 --> 09:55.367
No.
No.

09:55.467 --> 09:55.767
No.
No.

09:55.867 --> 09:57.133
No.

09:57.233 --> 09:58.667
You see, to me as a
psychic, Halloween is really

09:58.767 --> 10:02.233
all about exploring the veil
between the living and the dead

10:02.333 --> 10:03.700
when it's at its thinnest.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.567
- Do I need to wear a costume?
- Yes, please.

10:05.667 --> 10:06.567
OK.

10:12.633 --> 10:14.167
Well, we've both
look sensational.

10:14.267 --> 10:16.133
You should seriously wear
that outfit more often.

10:16.233 --> 10:19.167
MEG: Guys, are you
ready to be afraid?

10:24.433 --> 10:25.100
Of what?

10:25.200 --> 10:26.400
I don't know you.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.900
I'm the scariest thing
of all, the patriarchy.

10:29.000 --> 10:29.833
Props.

10:29.933 --> 10:32.167
Briefcase full of porn--

10:32.267 --> 10:39.600
sexist-- and binoculars, with
which to objectify women.

10:39.700 --> 10:41.833
Ooh, boobies.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.033
It's so political.

10:43.133 --> 10:44.000
Andrew is going to love it.

10:44.100 --> 10:44.900
What does that mean?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.367
Well, it's a joke.

10:46.467 --> 10:48.800
Meg, men hate it when
girls make jokes.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.233
Everyone knows that.

10:50.333 --> 10:52.333
And just to be clear, you
two still haven't fucked.

10:52.433 --> 10:53.067
No.

10:53.167 --> 10:54.000
All right.

10:54.100 --> 10:55.133
You're getting changed.

10:55.233 --> 10:56.267
Oh, come on.

10:56.367 --> 10:59.600
It's Meg [inaudible].

10:59.700 --> 11:00.533
You're sure about this?

11:00.633 --> 11:01.600
Much better.

11:01.700 --> 11:02.833
Now you look like her.

11:02.933 --> 11:05.333
Yeah, it's definitely
really political.

11:05.433 --> 11:07.767
I can't take anymore
rejection from Andrew.

11:07.867 --> 11:08.867
It's make or break tonight.

11:08.967 --> 11:10.233
If you're really
desperate, you

11:10.333 --> 11:11.400
can always do the come bluff.

11:11.500 --> 11:12.533
Good call.

11:12.633 --> 11:14.100
Wait, the what?

11:14.200 --> 11:15.667
What is it?

11:15.767 --> 11:18.933
The come bluff is a technique
I normally save for the truly

11:19.033 --> 11:21.567
unattainable grade-A motive.

11:21.667 --> 11:22.933
What is it?

11:23.033 --> 11:24.667
Well, you just tell him you
haven't come from sex before.

11:24.767 --> 11:25.667
They come as a challenge.

11:25.767 --> 11:27.300
Wow.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.833
God, I hate this fit for a party
when you feel like no one is

11:29.933 --> 11:31.033
going to turn up.

11:31.133 --> 11:33.000
You have invited
people, haven't you?

11:33.100 --> 11:34.700
Well, who have you invited?

11:34.800 --> 11:36.833
Just spirits, but
obviously only I

11:36.933 --> 11:37.900
can communicate with them.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.367
So guys-- yep,
yep, they're here.

11:41.467 --> 11:42.633
Oh, and Scott.

11:42.733 --> 11:43.800
Bless him.

11:43.900 --> 11:45.267
I think he might
be in love with me.

11:45.367 --> 11:46.867
We shared my
spiritual awakening.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.500
You mean he wants to fuck you.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.233
Tonight is about
channeling my gift.

11:50.333 --> 11:51.767
Sex doesn't come into it.

11:51.867 --> 11:53.300
I mean, your
tits are right out.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.500
They called and said hi.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.000
They said they might
not come till later.

11:56.100 --> 11:56.900
Might?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.467
[knock on door]

11:58.567 --> 11:59.700
Right.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.733
Get the music on.

12:01.833 --> 12:06.067
Remember slutty party, guys.

12:06.167 --> 12:07.967
There's someone
dressed as Santa.

12:08.067 --> 12:09.200
Oh, and Andrew.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.933
OK, make it look
like we're having fun.

12:12.033 --> 12:13.300
Let's dance.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.867
Dance!

12:14.967 --> 12:16.333
Sluttier.

12:16.433 --> 12:17.233
Slutty funk.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.800
Andrew, do come in.

12:26.900 --> 12:28.767
Oh.

12:28.867 --> 12:30.000
Hey.

12:30.100 --> 12:30.933
You came.

12:31.033 --> 12:32.500
That's cool.

12:32.600 --> 12:33.633
Sorry, I didn't see you.

12:33.733 --> 12:36.933
I was just busy dancing
and having a great time.

12:37.033 --> 12:38.500
Is that Nathan?

12:38.600 --> 12:39.567
Who's Nathan?

12:39.667 --> 12:40.833
Gary, out.

12:40.933 --> 12:41.767
Now.

12:41.867 --> 12:43.567
You look nice.

12:43.667 --> 12:44.500
What are you supposed to be?

12:44.600 --> 12:47.000
I'm a porn person.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.733
It's political.

12:48.833 --> 12:50.667
How?

12:50.767 --> 12:51.967
Empowering.

12:52.067 --> 12:54.700
Look, I know it's over,
and you've moved on.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.967
You've been wasting your
time with a loser like me

12:57.067 --> 12:58.000
for too long time now.

12:58.100 --> 12:58.967
Correct.

12:59.067 --> 13:00.267
Let me come to your party.

13:00.367 --> 13:03.300
I'll be no trouble.
- All right.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.667
You can stay because I need
to get my numbers up in case

13:05.767 --> 13:06.767
my work mates come.

13:06.867 --> 13:08.467
And if they do
come, you can leave.

13:08.567 --> 13:09.733
Deal?
- Deal.

13:09.833 --> 13:10.633
[knock on door]

13:10.733 --> 13:12.267
It's Scott.

13:12.367 --> 13:14.400
Oh, and someone
else come for you.

13:14.500 --> 13:15.767
Let's dance.

13:15.867 --> 13:16.867
Dance!

13:16.967 --> 13:18.933
He's made a real
effort for me.

13:19.033 --> 13:20.800
Bless him.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.667
Scott, hi.

13:23.767 --> 13:24.667
Oh, who are you?

13:24.767 --> 13:30.233
This is Lizzie, my girlfriend.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.233
Hi.

13:32.333 --> 13:33.233
Hi.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.067
Happy Halloween.

13:41.167 --> 13:43.000
Happy Halloween.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.000
[gasping]

13:47.867 --> 13:49.600
What's in that?

13:49.700 --> 13:51.100
My special recipe--

13:51.200 --> 13:56.533
beer, absinthe, whiskey, rum,
wine, orange squash, milk.

13:56.633 --> 13:59.900
So Lizzie, has Scott
told you I'm psychic?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.267
Psychic?

14:01.367 --> 14:02.000
No.

14:02.100 --> 14:03.033
Yes.

14:03.133 --> 14:05.333
It is impressive, isn't it?

14:05.433 --> 14:07.300
Oh, the spirits.

14:07.400 --> 14:10.433
Oh, they're getting restless.

14:10.533 --> 14:11.933
It's time for the
seance to commence.

14:12.033 --> 14:13.733
Oh, fucking hell.

14:13.833 --> 14:17.533
Guys, as it's Halloween,
the veil between the living

14:17.633 --> 14:20.167
and the dead is at
its thinnest, so I'm

14:20.267 --> 14:23.633
going to use my gift to
contact spirits or souls

14:23.733 --> 14:25.800
using a method called souling.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.033
Souling?

14:27.133 --> 14:28.100
Is that short for assholing?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.033
I love you.

14:29.133 --> 14:30.267
Shut up.

14:30.367 --> 14:32.667
OK, I'm channeling
the other side now.

14:32.767 --> 14:35.267
So does anybody have
anything they'd like to ask?

14:35.367 --> 14:36.233
Yep.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.667
What time is Nathan
getting here?

14:37.767 --> 14:39.000
Yeah, I'm not going to
bother the spirits with that.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.633
Do you have a proper question?
- Yep.

14:40.733 --> 14:41.867
[inaudible]?

14:41.967 --> 14:43.233
I don't think it's bollocks.

14:43.333 --> 14:45.000
Thank you, Lizzie.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.467
And I will start with you.

14:46.567 --> 14:48.000
Could you cross my
palm with silver?

14:58.000 --> 14:58.800
Hm.

14:58.900 --> 15:00.667
This is interesting.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.067
This is about your relationship.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.233
You're in a new
relationship, am I right?

15:04.333 --> 15:05.000
Yes.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.100
I sense that.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.367
You didn't really
sense it though.

15:11.700 --> 15:14.833
I mean.

15:14.933 --> 15:15.867
Oh.

15:15.967 --> 15:17.000
No, is it bad?

15:17.100 --> 15:17.900
Yep.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.500
This does denote death.

15:19.600 --> 15:20.567
Oh, my god.

15:20.667 --> 15:21.833
You might not die.

15:21.933 --> 15:23.600
It just means that the
relationship itself is doomed.

15:23.700 --> 15:25.200
Bloody hell, Bunny.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.567
Oh, no.

15:26.667 --> 15:28.533
It's not real.

15:28.633 --> 15:29.867
Shall we play a game?

15:29.967 --> 15:31.367
- Yes.
- No.

15:31.467 --> 15:31.967
No.
No.

15:32.067 --> 15:32.967
Wait.
Wait.

15:33.067 --> 15:35.867
OK, no, I'm getting something.

15:35.967 --> 15:38.467
I'm getting the spirit as a man.

15:38.567 --> 15:39.867
Does that mean
anything to anybody?

15:39.967 --> 15:42.100
- No.
- He's northern.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.833
Ask him if his name is Nigel.

15:43.933 --> 15:45.733
Of course, it's not
fucking Nigel, Gary.

15:45.833 --> 15:46.767
It might be.

15:46.867 --> 15:47.933
No it is.

15:48.033 --> 15:48.900
It is Nigel.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.067
Uncle Nige.

15:50.167 --> 15:54.500
Yeah, he's saying
sorry I had to go.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.867
Yeah?

15:55.967 --> 15:57.500
He only died a few weeks ago.

15:57.600 --> 15:58.433
Is he OK?

15:58.533 --> 15:59.367
No, Gary.

15:59.467 --> 16:00.500
He's dead.

16:00.600 --> 16:01.767
You were quite
close, weren't you?

16:01.867 --> 16:03.267
Yeah.

16:03.367 --> 16:05.000
After me Dad left, me mom
were left on the road with me

16:05.100 --> 16:06.233
and me brother.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.467
So uncle Nigel kind
of the closest thing

16:07.567 --> 16:08.500
I had to a real dad.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.000
--closest thing you
had to a real dad.

16:10.100 --> 16:10.933
Fuck sake.

16:11.033 --> 16:12.100
I'm sorry.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.033
Nothing to be
embarrassed about, mate.

16:14.133 --> 16:17.433
He's saying, hi, Gary.

16:17.533 --> 16:19.033
Hi, Nige.

16:19.133 --> 16:21.600
He's wearing trousers.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.567
He always wore trousers.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.467
And he has as a wallet.

16:25.567 --> 16:26.600
Nige.

16:26.700 --> 16:28.767
And there are pen and paper.

16:28.867 --> 16:30.367
That makes sense.

16:30.467 --> 16:31.800
He always wrote stuff down.

16:31.900 --> 16:33.033
What else?

16:33.133 --> 16:34.500
Ask him if he's met Prince.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.433
Ugh.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.533
He's gone now.

16:41.633 --> 16:43.767
But it just goes to show that
the souls of the dead, they

16:43.867 --> 16:45.033
never leave us.

16:45.133 --> 16:45.967
That's 5 pounds, Gary.

16:46.067 --> 16:47.300
Great.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.667
Drinking game?
- Yes.

16:48.767 --> 16:49.600
Yes, please.

16:49.700 --> 16:50.333
No, I'm not done yet.

16:50.433 --> 16:51.900
You're being a bus kill.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.833
This isn't a saucy party.

16:53.933 --> 16:55.167
Let's play I've never.

16:55.267 --> 16:56.400
Everyone knows the rules.

16:56.500 --> 16:57.800
If you have done it, you drink.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.300
If you haven't
done it, you don't

16:59.400 --> 17:01.267
I've have never witnessed
such disrespect for the dead.

17:01.367 --> 17:02.633
That's not the game.

17:02.733 --> 17:05.167
I've never been so heart
broken in all me life.

17:05.267 --> 17:07.200
I've never been so in love.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.233
Again, it's not the game.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.300
I've never come
from having sex.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.767
Really?

17:16.867 --> 17:18.767
Are you sure?

17:18.867 --> 17:21.567
M-hm.

17:21.667 --> 17:27.333
So did you just
fake it then or what?

17:27.433 --> 17:28.500
No.

17:28.600 --> 17:29.833
Never come from
having sex, Scott.

17:29.933 --> 17:31.367
So let's just drop it.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.633
That can't possibly be true.

17:33.733 --> 17:34.533
All right, Scott.

17:34.633 --> 17:35.667
Just leave it.

17:35.767 --> 17:36.733
Why do you care so much anyway?

17:36.833 --> 17:38.100
I'm just curious.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.767
Shall we play
a different game?

17:39.867 --> 17:40.867
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:40.967 --> 17:41.767
Yeah.

17:41.867 --> 17:42.967
You two had sex?

17:43.067 --> 17:45.367
Yeah, we had, but
it was no big deal.

17:45.467 --> 17:47.867
I was talking
about Scott and Meg.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.200
Oh, sorry.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.133
Yeah, they have had.

17:50.233 --> 17:53.100
What the fuck.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.133
All right.
I see.

17:54.233 --> 17:55.367
Please don't leave.

17:55.467 --> 17:56.500
- Just going to the toilet.
- All right.

17:56.600 --> 17:57.767
That's fine.
- Just let me explain.

17:57.867 --> 17:58.900
Why would you
take me to a party

17:59.000 --> 18:00.467
where you've slept
with two people?

18:00.567 --> 18:02.533
Anyone else in the
building you slept with?

18:02.633 --> 18:04.000
Lizzie, don't leave.

18:04.100 --> 18:06.967
Lizzie.

18:07.067 --> 18:08.533
Thanks a lot, guys.

18:08.633 --> 18:09.500
Great party.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.100
Whew boy.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.800
Somebody wasn't ready
to hear the truth.

18:12.900 --> 18:14.567
I'll go over now.

18:14.667 --> 18:15.567
Scott will need me.

18:15.667 --> 18:17.333
Bunny, just leave it.

18:17.433 --> 18:19.267
You've already caused
a massive fight.

18:19.367 --> 18:20.467
I think you've done enough.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.700
Oh, you can never
do enough, Meg,

18:22.800 --> 18:24.433
not when you have the gift.

18:27.633 --> 18:30.267
And she just shattered
all hopes of me

18:30.367 --> 18:31.700
ever sleeping with Andrew.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.667
It's a bust all around.

18:33.767 --> 18:34.700
Party is over.

18:34.800 --> 18:35.800
Nathan's not coming, is he?

18:35.900 --> 18:36.800
Who is Nathan?

18:36.900 --> 18:38.967
The guy I want to fuck, Gus.

18:39.067 --> 18:44.033
Bollocks, I look well
hot and all for a waste.

18:44.133 --> 18:45.567
Scottie, is
everything all right?

18:49.100 --> 18:51.467
I just want to say I'm sorry.

18:51.567 --> 18:54.100
Sorry that my psychic
abilities caused you a rift,

18:54.200 --> 18:55.933
not only between this
world and the next,

18:56.033 --> 18:58.300
but also in your most
sacred relationship.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.633
You're not psychic, Bunny.

19:00.733 --> 19:01.800
You're psychotic.

19:01.900 --> 19:03.367
Then how do you
explain me predicting

19:03.467 --> 19:05.633
the end of your
relationship with Lizzie?

19:05.733 --> 19:06.567
Bunny.

19:06.667 --> 19:07.933
What?

19:08.033 --> 19:10.600
Thank you so much for just
laying it all out in the open.

19:10.700 --> 19:13.633
Me and Scott talked about
it, and he explained

19:13.733 --> 19:14.567
that you meant nothing.

19:14.667 --> 19:15.400
Nothing at all.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.500
That it was just meaningless.

19:16.600 --> 19:17.700
Clinical if anything.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.367
Said he pretty much
brought the whole thing out.

19:20.467 --> 19:21.400
Good.

19:21.500 --> 19:22.833
Thank god for your
psychic abilities.

19:22.933 --> 19:24.067
We're stronger than ever.

19:34.100 --> 19:35.100
Yep.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.733
Better be off then.

19:44.833 --> 19:50.167
One more drink before you go?

19:50.267 --> 19:51.067
OK.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.300
To mates.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.233
Mates.

20:06.267 --> 20:07.933
Outfit suits you, by they way.

20:08.033 --> 20:09.667
So do yours.

20:09.767 --> 20:10.600
I like you with a beard.

20:13.367 --> 20:16.533
Do you want to come
and sit on Santa's knee?

20:16.633 --> 20:18.500
Just as mates like.

20:18.600 --> 20:19.533
All right.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.600
Can mates still kiss?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.167
He was nothing.

20:35.267 --> 20:38.567
He was just a shag,
just a meaningless notch

20:38.667 --> 20:39.367
on the bedpost.

20:39.467 --> 20:41.133
He seemed like a nice guy.

20:41.233 --> 20:47.200
Lovely bloke, but
just a fling, really.

20:47.300 --> 20:50.700
See, this is exactly
what I'm worried about.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.800
I want more with
you than just sex.

20:53.900 --> 20:54.700
Definitely.

20:54.800 --> 20:55.867
Yeah.

20:55.967 --> 20:57.700
I've been in this
situation before,

20:57.800 --> 20:59.567
and I don't want to get hurt.

20:59.667 --> 21:01.033
I trust you.

21:01.133 --> 21:03.633
That's why I've waited.

21:03.733 --> 21:06.133
I just think it's so
important that we're

21:06.233 --> 21:07.533
honest with each other.

21:07.633 --> 21:08.633
Yep.

21:08.733 --> 21:10.533
I completely agree.

21:10.633 --> 21:14.600
We should absolutely be
honest with each other.

21:14.700 --> 21:19.633
So is it true you've
never come from sex before?

21:19.733 --> 21:20.867
Yep.

21:20.967 --> 21:24.233
Well, then maybe we
should rectify that.

21:33.300 --> 21:34.967
You sure this is OK?

21:35.067 --> 21:35.933
Yeah.

21:36.033 --> 21:36.900
It's fine.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.333
Just put it straight in.

21:39.433 --> 21:40.100
Oh!

21:40.200 --> 21:42.167
Oh, thank god!

21:42.267 --> 21:43.567
Oh.

21:43.667 --> 21:44.967
Oh.

21:45.067 --> 21:46.533
Oh!

21:46.633 --> 21:47.933
Oh.

21:48.033 --> 21:49.100
Wow.

21:56.367 --> 21:58.533
Actually, can we stop?

21:58.633 --> 22:04.167
It's just I'm not really
feeling it now that I've ah--

22:04.267 --> 22:05.567
Yep.
Sure.

22:05.667 --> 22:06.500
Yeah.

22:09.500 --> 22:10.200
Jesus.

22:10.300 --> 22:12.700
Close the deal, Gary.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.067
I'm closing it.

22:14.167 --> 22:15.600
Can we come--

22:18.600 --> 22:20.067
Hi.

22:20.167 --> 22:21.000
Everything all right?

22:21.100 --> 22:22.767
Yeah.

22:22.867 --> 22:25.567
You've met Gary.

22:25.667 --> 22:26.900
All right, mate.

22:27.000 --> 22:27.867
All right.

22:27.967 --> 22:30.900
Guys, can you keep it down?

22:31.000 --> 22:33.433
What's all the commosh?

22:33.533 --> 22:35.800
[crying]

22:39.733 --> 22:40.533
Has he just--

22:40.633 --> 22:41.467
No.

22:41.567 --> 22:43.267
Yeah.

22:43.367 --> 22:44.833
- Should we go?
- Yeah.

22:44.933 --> 22:45.733
Yeah.

22:45.833 --> 22:47.100
We're going to go.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.333
See you Monday, Laura.

22:48.433 --> 22:49.667
Should we?

22:49.767 --> 22:51.600
Yeah.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.100
See you.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.400
Thanks a lot, Santa.

22:58.500 --> 23:00.000
Get out!

23:00.100 --> 23:02.200
Take the binge with ya.

23:05.700 --> 23:06.533
Out!

23:06.633 --> 23:09.333
