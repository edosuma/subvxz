00:34.060 --> 00:36.060
Oh, you're here!

00:36.620 --> 00:39.340
Oh, hello, everyone.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.540
Have you come to see Peppa?

00:44.660 --> 00:46.860
I'm Daisy. I'm friends with Peppa.

00:48.499 --> 00:50.340
Are you friends with Peppa as well?

00:51.940 --> 00:56.180
You are? Well, that's good because
if you're friends with Peppa

00:56.420 --> 00:57.740
and I'm friends with Peppa,

00:58.380 --> 00:59.740
that means that we're friends, too.

01:00.300 --> 01:02.177
Let's all say hello.

01:02.179 --> 01:03.380
Hello, everyone!

01:03.899 --> 01:05.298
Hello, grown-ups!

01:05.300 --> 01:06.778
Hello, boys and girls.

01:06.780 --> 01:08.540
Hello!

01:08.940 --> 01:12.298
Hello? Daisy? Are you here?

01:12.300 --> 01:13.459
Do you know who that is?

01:13.979 --> 01:16.939
- Hello?
- Yes! Ooh, it's Peppa!

01:17.179 --> 01:18.897
She's inside. Come on!

01:18.899 --> 01:21.339
Daisy? Daisy!

01:23.220 --> 01:26.380
- Hello, Daisy.
- Hi, Peppa.

01:27.300 --> 01:29.380
Oh, hello, George.

01:29.899 --> 01:33.897
Peppa, George, look who's come to see you.

01:33.899 --> 01:35.578
Ooh!

01:35.580 --> 01:37.819
Hello! Hello, everyone!

01:38.500 --> 01:40.860
George, say hello to all our friends.

01:41.259 --> 01:44.658
We are so excited to see you!

01:44.660 --> 01:46.380
Today's a very special day.

01:46.699 --> 01:50.697
Yes, it is.
I'm going to show everyone my adventures!

01:50.699 --> 01:53.617
- Adventures?
- We went on holiday.

01:53.619 --> 01:55.057
Oh!

01:55.059 --> 01:57.979
Yes, that's right, George.
We found sunken treasure.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.098
Whoa! Treasure?

02:00.100 --> 02:01.899
And I got this!

02:03.419 --> 02:06.100
Do you know what this is?
It's called a boomerang.

02:07.140 --> 02:10.377
It is a stick
that looks like a banana,

02:10.380 --> 02:12.778
but it comes back when you throw it away.

02:12.780 --> 02:14.979
Wow! No wonder you're excited.

02:15.419 --> 02:17.778
And we went to London.

02:17.780 --> 02:19.737
Whoa!

02:19.739 --> 02:22.379
That's right, George, we went on a bus!

02:22.660 --> 02:24.378
And met the Queen!

02:24.380 --> 02:28.378
The Queen?
Oh, what a great time you've both had!

02:28.380 --> 02:30.857
Would you like to see my adventures, Daisy?

02:30.859 --> 02:32.579
Oh, I certainly would.

02:32.979 --> 02:34.780
Would you like to see them?

02:35.780 --> 02:38.340
- Would you? Really?
- Yes!

02:38.699 --> 02:42.220
Then, what you have to do is oink.

02:42.620 --> 02:46.860
We can do that, can't we?
Have a go.

02:49.060 --> 02:51.977
That was great!
But you can be even louder than that!

02:55.940 --> 02:59.020
Welcome to my adventures!

02:59.299 --> 03:00.817
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

03:05.380 --> 03:07.297
I'm Peppa Pig!

03:07.299 --> 03:09.977
This is my little brother George.

03:09.979 --> 03:12.378
This is Mummy Pig.

03:12.380 --> 03:14.058
And this is Daddy Pig.

03:16.180 --> 03:17.660
Peppa Pig!

03:20.380 --> 03:23.539
Peppa and her playgroup
are visiting London for the day.

03:23.819 --> 03:26.977
Children, this is London!

03:26.979 --> 03:29.458
Wow! It's so busy!

03:29.460 --> 03:33.898
There's so much to see!
I just can't decide where to go first!

03:33.900 --> 03:37.620
My friend the Queen lives in London.
Maybe she can help.

03:39.259 --> 03:41.940
This is the palace
where the Queen lives.

03:43.620 --> 03:46.658
- Hello?
- Please, can I speak to the Queen?

03:46.660 --> 03:49.297
I am the Queen. Who are you?

03:49.299 --> 03:50.817
It's Miss Rabbit.

03:50.819 --> 03:54.938
You said if I was ever in London,
I should drop in to see you.

03:54.940 --> 03:58.300
Ah, Miss Rabbit! Come in! Come in!

04:01.139 --> 04:02.737
Hello, everyone!

04:02.739 --> 04:04.338
Hello, Queen!

04:04.340 --> 04:07.297
We're visiting London for the day!

04:07.299 --> 04:10.697
We were hoping you could tell us
the best places to see.

04:10.699 --> 04:12.577
I can do better than that!

04:12.579 --> 04:15.779
After all, London is my city.

04:16.220 --> 04:20.260
- I'll give you a guided tour myself.
- Hooray!

04:20.939 --> 04:24.977
The best way to see London
is on a double-decker bus.

04:24.979 --> 04:26.098
Ooh!

04:26.100 --> 04:29.737
Mr. Driver, please may we borrow your bus?

04:29.739 --> 04:32.617
Borrow my bus? You must be joking!

04:32.619 --> 04:34.499
No. I am your Queen.

04:34.739 --> 04:37.497
In that case, Your Majesty, take it!

04:37.499 --> 04:40.937
If the Queen asks you
to do something, you must do it!

04:40.939 --> 04:43.057
Everyone up to the top deck!

04:43.059 --> 04:46.539
The bus has stairs in it!

04:46.780 --> 04:49.617
The double-decker bus
has seats at the top!

04:51.580 --> 04:55.417
I am the Queen
and I will be your tour guide today.

04:55.419 --> 04:57.857
First stop, Big Ben.

04:57.859 --> 05:00.617
This tall clock tower

05:00.619 --> 05:02.539
is called Big Ben.

05:02.820 --> 05:06.580
Actually, Big Ben is the bell, not the tower.

05:06.979 --> 05:09.578
You know a lot for a little elephant.

05:09.580 --> 05:12.060
- I'm a clever clogs.
- Oh.

05:16.379 --> 05:18.059
That was loud!

05:18.379 --> 05:21.979
That is the sound
of Big Ben telling us the time.

05:22.260 --> 05:26.138
It rang three times, so it is 3:00.

05:26.140 --> 05:30.260
If it rang six times, would that make it 6:00?

05:30.539 --> 05:31.818
Yes, it would.

05:31.820 --> 05:34.898
And if it rang 100 times?

05:34.900 --> 05:36.500
Then it would be broken.

05:37.379 --> 05:39.497
On with the tour!

05:39.499 --> 05:42.100
Next stop, Tower Bridge!

05:45.340 --> 05:48.698
We need to cross the bridge
to continue the tour.

05:48.700 --> 05:51.100
Stop! You can't cross!

05:51.340 --> 05:53.937
Look! There's a big ship!

05:55.900 --> 05:58.617
It's going to bang into the bridge!

06:00.939 --> 06:03.937
- The bridge is lifting up!
- Wow!

06:03.939 --> 06:07.100
Tower Bridge lifts
to let tall ships sail through.

06:07.460 --> 06:09.537
Good. Now the ship has passed,

06:09.539 --> 06:10.859
we can be on our way.

06:11.140 --> 06:13.057
Please lower the bridge.

06:13.059 --> 06:14.737
I'm sorry, Your Majesty,

06:14.739 --> 06:16.977
but there's another ship coming.

06:16.979 --> 06:19.018
This is really too much.

06:19.020 --> 06:21.338
We can't wait around all day.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.460
Hold tight, everyone!

06:28.499 --> 06:30.537
Whee!

06:33.780 --> 06:36.258
The bus is balancing
on the bridge.

06:36.260 --> 06:37.898
Now, what do we do?

06:37.900 --> 06:41.658
Hang on a minute, lads, I've got a great idea.

06:41.660 --> 06:44.737
Everybody move to the front of the bus.

06:44.739 --> 06:46.900
Okay!

06:48.419 --> 06:49.939
Hooray!

06:50.460 --> 06:52.857
The Queen is good
at driving buses.

06:53.939 --> 06:56.417
Are you enjoying your tour, children?

06:56.419 --> 07:00.617
- Yes!
- Open-top buses are the best!

07:00.619 --> 07:03.658
Why aren't all buses open like this one?

07:03.660 --> 07:05.458
It is raining.

07:05.460 --> 07:09.859
Ah, yes, that's why all buses
aren't open like this one.

07:10.499 --> 07:13.698
Children, open your umbrellas.

07:13.700 --> 07:17.778
It is very important to take
an umbrella when you visit London.

07:17.780 --> 07:20.460
Next stop, Trafalgar Square.

07:21.820 --> 07:26.177
Oh, dear, what a shame!
Trafalgar Square is full of puddles!

07:26.179 --> 07:28.220
But we love puddles!

07:31.660 --> 07:34.778
Come on, have a splash, Your Majesty!

07:34.780 --> 07:36.578
It does look rather fun

07:36.580 --> 07:39.338
and one is wearing one's boots.

07:39.340 --> 07:40.977
Whee!

07:40.979 --> 07:43.898
The Queen loves jumping
in London puddles.

07:43.900 --> 07:47.020
Everybody loves jumping in London puddles!

07:48.179 --> 07:50.979
Ding-ding! All aboard!

07:51.419 --> 07:53.857
Daisy is taking us on a bus tour.

07:53.859 --> 07:58.138
- Are you the Queen, Daisy?
- No, I'm the bus driver.

07:58.140 --> 08:00.377
Hold tight at the back there!

08:00.379 --> 08:02.458
Hold tight, George!

08:02.460 --> 08:05.380
Whee!

08:06.299 --> 08:08.539
Coming up on this side
is Buckingham Palace.

08:09.220 --> 08:11.380
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

08:11.900 --> 08:15.098
George, this is where the Queen lives!

08:16.419 --> 08:18.660
Come on, everyone.
Let's all wave to the Queen.

08:19.340 --> 08:20.940
Hello, Queen!

08:21.379 --> 08:22.857
Copy me, everyone.

08:22.859 --> 08:25.220
Hello, Queen!

08:25.499 --> 08:26.499
Very good!

08:26.739 --> 08:30.340
- Can everyone come on our tour, Daisy?
- Of course they can.

08:31.419 --> 08:34.499
Can you make the wheels
go round and round, like this?

08:36.940 --> 08:38.578

08:50.820 --> 08:53.818
Tower Bridge, George!

08:53.820 --> 08:55.379
Can you all make a bridge like this?

08:55.619 --> 08:59.659
Then it goes up and down, up and down.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.257
What can you see from the bus?

09:13.259 --> 09:16.058
- I can see Big Ben!
- Oh, yes!

09:16.060 --> 09:18.657
Come on, everyone, can you be Big Ben?

09:37.300 --> 09:39.100
George says, it's starting to rain!

Oh, yes! Make some rain,

10:00.379 --> 10:03.820
Oh, Peppa.

10:06.499 --> 10:08.458
I'm Peppa Pig!

10:08.460 --> 10:11.098
This is my little brother George.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.497
This is Mummy Pig.

10:13.499 --> 10:15.178
And this is Daddy Pig.

10:17.060 --> 10:19.060
Peppa Pig!

10:21.540 --> 10:24.780
Peppa and her friends
have brought their bikes to playgroup.

10:25.259 --> 10:29.178
Children, today we have
very important visitors.

10:29.180 --> 10:31.737
The police are coming to our playgroup!

10:31.739 --> 10:33.058
Ooh!

10:33.060 --> 10:36.458
The police drive cars with flashing lights!

10:36.460 --> 10:40.298
- Nee-naw! Nee-naw! Nee-naw!
- No! It's dee-dor, dee-dor, dee-dor!

10:40.300 --> 10:43.977
No, police cars go whoo-whoo, whoo-whoo...

10:45.340 --> 10:47.257
Yes, yes, if I might explain,

10:47.259 --> 10:49.338
what I was about to say was...

10:49.340 --> 10:51.017
Hooray! It's the police!

10:51.019 --> 10:52.699
Here are the police.

10:56.420 --> 10:59.657
- Hello, 'ello, 'ello!
- Hello, 'ello, 'ello!

10:59.659 --> 11:01.459
That is how the police say hello.

11:01.739 --> 11:04.298
Hello, 'ello, 'ello!

11:04.300 --> 11:06.458
I'm Police Officer Squirrel.

11:06.460 --> 11:08.379
And I'm Police Officer Panda.

11:08.619 --> 11:12.897
We're going to teach you
how to ride your bicycles safely.

11:12.899 --> 11:14.418
- Ooh!
- Right.

11:14.420 --> 11:17.737
Let's see you all riding your bikes!

11:19.779 --> 11:21.218
Look where you're going!

11:21.220 --> 11:23.779
Always keep your ears and eyes open.

11:24.019 --> 11:25.619
And stop!

11:26.139 --> 11:27.857
Well done, children!

11:27.859 --> 11:30.379
Now, suppose you're riding your bike along

11:30.619 --> 11:33.060
and someone steps out in front of you.

11:33.300 --> 11:34.497
What do you do?

11:34.499 --> 11:36.257
Uh...

11:36.259 --> 11:39.617
I would ring my bell!

11:39.619 --> 11:43.779
Very good! Ringing your bell
lets others know you are there.

11:44.180 --> 11:47.780
Can you all show me how good you are
at ringing bells?

11:50.259 --> 11:53.698
Um, I don't have a bell. I have a horn.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.979
A horn is just as good as a bell.

11:56.259 --> 12:00.338
Could you give your horn
a tiny little toot so that we can all...

12:00.340 --> 12:01.460
Ahhh!

12:01.700 --> 12:06.100
Yes, that should be sufficient
to alert the public of your approach.

12:06.899 --> 12:08.979
Now, for the last bit of the lesson.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.659
Where's he going?

12:11.899 --> 12:15.499
Police Officer Panda
is driving to the bottom of the hill.

12:17.540 --> 12:20.500
Calling Police Officer Squirrel. Over.

12:20.820 --> 12:22.340
Can you read me? Over.

12:22.899 --> 12:25.899
Read you loud and clear. Over.

12:26.659 --> 12:29.699
The police have
special phones to talk to each other.

12:30.100 --> 12:32.259
I'm in position. Over.

12:32.659 --> 12:37.578
Now, when I blow my whistle,
I want you all to cycle down the hill

12:37.580 --> 12:39.257
and use your brakes

12:39.259 --> 12:42.899
to not bump into Police Officer Panda.

12:43.700 --> 12:44.938
Okay!

12:47.859 --> 12:50.019
They're on their way. Over.

12:50.580 --> 12:52.977
I see them coming! Over.

12:57.700 --> 12:59.660
Very good braking, everyone!

13:00.180 --> 13:03.700
Are you ready for Madame Gazelle? Over.

13:04.259 --> 13:06.418
Send her down! Over.

13:06.420 --> 13:08.620
Uh, I don't think I need to do this.

13:08.940 --> 13:11.098
I am the teacher and I wasn't supposed...

13:11.100 --> 13:13.338
- Off you go!
- Ooh! Ahhh!

13:13.340 --> 13:17.058
- Ears and eyes open!
- Ears and eyes open. Yes.

13:17.060 --> 13:19.857
Whee-hee! This is fun!

13:19.859 --> 13:22.700
- Ring your bell!
- Oh, yes. Ring bell.

13:23.259 --> 13:24.857
Brakes!

13:24.859 --> 13:26.818
Oh, yes. Brakes.

13:28.100 --> 13:32.017
Well done!
And that's how to ride your bicycles safely.

13:33.300 --> 13:36.938
Children, thank the police for taking time off

13:36.940 --> 13:40.458
from their important work to talk to us today.

13:40.460 --> 13:43.220
- Thank you!
- You're very welcome.

13:43.499 --> 13:46.499
When I grow up, I want to be a policeman!

13:46.779 --> 13:49.777
And what is it about being a policeman
that you like?

13:49.779 --> 13:52.818
I like blowing whistles!

13:52.820 --> 13:56.178
Very good! But of course
there's more to being a police officer

13:56.180 --> 13:57.657
than blowing whistles!

13:57.659 --> 14:00.377
Oh, yes! We're always very busy!

14:00.379 --> 14:02.820
We do lots of very important things.

14:03.060 --> 14:04.818
Like, uh...

14:04.820 --> 14:09.698
The police solve mysteries
and drive cars with flashing lights!

14:09.700 --> 14:12.940
- Nee-naw, nee-naw, whoo, whoo, whoo!
- Spot on, Freddy!

14:13.300 --> 14:15.538
Right, we really must be on our way.

14:15.540 --> 14:19.657
And remember, always keep
your ears and eyes open!

14:19.659 --> 14:22.977
Oh! Who put that tree there?

14:22.979 --> 14:26.060
Yes. It's not a safe place to put a tree.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.420
I'll make a note.

14:27.659 --> 14:31.539
"Dangerous tree on public highway."

14:32.739 --> 14:37.299
Ho-ho! You see, children,
a police officer's work is never done!

14:37.659 --> 14:39.977
- Bye, everyone!
- Bye-bye!

14:39.979 --> 14:42.098
Bye-bye!

14:42.100 --> 14:44.178
Peppa loves the police!

14:44.180 --> 14:46.777
Everyone loves the police.

14:59.659 --> 15:01.857
George! You're going too fast!

15:04.979 --> 15:07.857
George! It's gone wrong!

15:09.820 --> 15:11.060
Oh!

15:12.379 --> 15:15.857
Phew! Oh! Your turn now, Peppa.

15:15.859 --> 15:18.460
I don't think I want to drive a crane.

15:18.739 --> 15:21.619
Oh, okay.
Is there something else we can all drive?

15:21.940 --> 15:25.700
Yes, we would all like to drive a police car!

15:25.979 --> 15:29.058
Wouldn't we? Nee-naw, nee-naw, nee-naw!

15:29.060 --> 15:32.700
Oh, yes! A police car driving to an emergency!

15:33.180 --> 15:35.418
Nee-naw, nee-naw, nee-naw!

15:35.420 --> 15:37.660
Come on, George, it's an emergency!

15:44.340 --> 15:46.259
Oh, that's a good siren, Peppa.

15:46.820 --> 15:47.979
Can you all do that?

15:48.300 --> 15:51.060
Nee-naw! Nee-naw! Let me hear you, ready?

15:51.340 --> 15:54.700
Nee-naw! Nee-naw! Nee-naw! Nee-naw!

15:55.340 --> 15:57.178
Nee-naw.

15:58.820 --> 16:01.020
Oh, how about some flashing lights?

16:01.540 --> 16:03.377
Whoo-whoo!

16:03.379 --> 16:04.977
Come on, everyone, ready?

16:04.979 --> 16:09.338
- Whoo-whoo-whoo!
- Daisy, I'm meant to be nee-nawing.

16:09.340 --> 16:10.938
I can't whoo-whoo as well.

16:10.940 --> 16:12.660
Oh, of course.

16:13.060 --> 16:15.058
Okay, how about you and George

16:15.060 --> 16:17.897
and all the children do the driving
and the nee-nawing?

16:17.899 --> 16:19.579
Nee-naw! Nee-naw!

16:19.820 --> 16:22.859
And all the grownups can be
the flashing lights with me.

16:23.300 --> 16:26.377
Is everyone ready? Let's go!

16:26.379 --> 16:29.857
Nee-naw! Nee-naw! Nee-naw! Nee-naw!

16:29.859 --> 16:33.137
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

16:33.139 --> 16:36.737
Nee-naw! Nee-naw! Nee-naw! Nee-naw!

16:36.739 --> 16:39.820
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

16:40.180 --> 16:41.617
Faster! Faster!

16:41.619 --> 16:43.298
Nee-naw! Nee-naw! Nee-naw! Nee-naw!

16:43.300 --> 16:44.818
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

16:44.820 --> 16:46.377
Nee-naw! Nee-naw! Nee-naw! Nee-naw!

16:46.379 --> 16:47.977
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

16:47.979 --> 16:49.458
Nee-naw! Nee-naw! Nee-naw! Nee-naw!

16:49.460 --> 16:51.017
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

16:51.019 --> 16:52.578
Nee-naw! Nee-naw! Nee-naw! Nee-naw!

16:52.580 --> 16:54.178
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

16:54.180 --> 16:55.859
Stop!

16:56.859 --> 16:58.338
We're here!

16:58.340 --> 17:00.578
Just in time for another adventure!

17:00.580 --> 17:02.060
Hooray!

17:04.260 --> 17:06.176
I'm Peppa Pig.

17:06.179 --> 17:08.818
This is my little brother George.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.217
This is Mummy Pig.

17:11.219 --> 17:12.857
And this is Daddy Pig.

17:14.980 --> 17:16.780
Peppa Pig!

17:19.419 --> 17:22.416
Today is Captain Dog's birthday.

17:22.419 --> 17:24.779
Happy birthday, Captain Dog!

17:25.300 --> 17:28.220
Thank you, everyone.

17:28.459 --> 17:30.259
Daddy, you look sad.

17:30.580 --> 17:32.857
Oh, it's nothing, son.

17:32.859 --> 17:37.820
Just seeing this here boat reminded me
how much I miss the sea.

17:38.219 --> 17:40.217
Captain Dog loves the sea.

17:40.219 --> 17:42.499
Why not open your birthday present?

17:43.459 --> 17:46.018
- It's a boat trip!
- A boat trip?

17:46.020 --> 17:49.657
Woof! That's just what I wanted! Let's go!

17:53.820 --> 17:57.498
There's nothing better than sailing a boat!

17:57.500 --> 18:00.617
You can go anywhere you want
in a sailing boat!

18:00.619 --> 18:04.020
We could head for the tropics.
Or have an Arctic adventure.

18:04.260 --> 18:08.498
We might even see a whale! Ha-ha!

18:08.500 --> 18:10.460
It's just a day trip, dear.

18:12.219 --> 18:14.258
This is the canal.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.340
Now, where's the sailing boat?

18:16.659 --> 18:18.697
We're going on this canal boat.

18:18.699 --> 18:24.177
I see, we use the canal boat
to get to the sailing boat?

18:24.179 --> 18:27.937
No, dear.
We're going on this boat for your birthday

18:27.939 --> 18:30.258
and we're sailing it down the canal.

18:30.260 --> 18:34.060
But on a canal you can only
go this way and that way.

18:35.139 --> 18:38.459
- It'll be fun.
- Come on, Dad! It is a boat!

18:38.899 --> 18:42.897
Yes, Danny, you're right! A boat, on the water.

18:42.899 --> 18:46.298
- All aboard!
- Oh. I wanted to say that.

18:46.300 --> 18:48.580
Oh, I'm sorry. Go on, then.

18:48.820 --> 18:50.780
All aboard!

18:51.100 --> 18:55.699
Raise the sail! Oh, where is the sail?

18:55.980 --> 18:58.020
Canal boats do not have sails.

18:58.300 --> 19:00.897
You just push this button
to make the boat go.

19:00.899 --> 19:03.857
Ah! Thank you, Mummy Dog.

19:03.859 --> 19:06.578
And we're away!

19:12.139 --> 19:15.499
Mrs. Duck is going faster than our boat!

19:17.139 --> 19:19.417
Want a race, do you, Mrs. Duck?

19:20.899 --> 19:23.617
Full steam ahead!

19:26.619 --> 19:29.338
Um, can't this thing go any faster?

19:29.340 --> 19:32.177
- No. This is the top speed.
- Oh.

19:32.179 --> 19:36.617
Anyway, you want to slow down,
we're coming to a mountain.

19:36.619 --> 19:38.298
- Ahhh!
- Look out!

19:38.300 --> 19:39.940
There's a mountain in front!

19:40.300 --> 19:42.298
We're going to crash straight into it!

19:42.300 --> 19:45.377
No, we're going into the tunnel.

19:45.379 --> 19:47.818
There is a tunnel through the mountain.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.738
It's all gone dark!

19:49.740 --> 19:52.780
And our voices sound funny!

19:55.820 --> 20:00.177
We sailed straight through
the middle of a mountain! Ha-ha!

20:00.179 --> 20:03.058
This canal boat is actually quite fun!

20:05.340 --> 20:08.258
Look! Here comes another mountain!

20:08.260 --> 20:10.857
And that means another tunnel!

20:10.859 --> 20:12.538
Not this time.

20:12.540 --> 20:15.899
- Oh. There's no tunnel!
- So, what do we do?

20:16.139 --> 20:18.098
We're going uphill.

20:18.100 --> 20:21.738
There's no way in the world
a boat can go uphill!

20:21.740 --> 20:24.380
There is, and it's called a lock.

20:24.939 --> 20:26.657
Watch, I'll show you.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.377
Mummy Dog is opening
the gates to the lock.

20:29.379 --> 20:31.060
Take her in, Captain!

20:32.820 --> 20:36.058
Just wait there, while I close these lock gates.

20:37.980 --> 20:41.220
Now, I'm letting in the water from the top.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.338
We're going up!

20:43.340 --> 20:46.417
The rising water
is lifting the canal boat up.

20:46.419 --> 20:50.619
Now, I open these gates.
Take her out, Captain!

20:51.699 --> 20:54.377
Full steam ahead!

20:56.500 --> 20:59.018
Whoa! Where's the ground gone?

20:59.020 --> 21:02.740
- We're in the sky!
- We're sailing over a bridge!

21:03.100 --> 21:07.978
Yes. This bridge means we can sail high
above the valley below!

21:07.980 --> 21:11.058
Ha-Ha! Sailing across the sky!

23:37.340 --> 23:41.058
Today, we will be meeting wild animals!

23:41.060 --> 23:42.417
Ooh!

23:42.419 --> 23:47.738
But don't worry!
The wild animals will be safely behind fences.

23:47.740 --> 23:50.540
Ah! A lion has escaped!

23:51.020 --> 23:55.258
Hello. I'm Mr. Lion, welcome to the zoo.

23:55.260 --> 23:57.778
It is Mr. Lion, the zookeeper.

23:57.780 --> 23:59.657
Hello, Mr. Lion!

23:59.659 --> 24:03.058
You've picked a good time to visit.
It's feeding time.

24:03.060 --> 24:05.897
- Ooh!
- This way to the animals!

24:09.179 --> 24:11.019
Here are the tortoises.

24:11.260 --> 24:12.578
Ooh!

24:12.580 --> 24:16.018
We keep this gate shut,
so they don't run away.

24:16.020 --> 24:18.498
They don't look like they could ever run.

24:18.500 --> 24:22.338
No! They're moving very slowly.

24:22.340 --> 24:25.459
Yes, that's why they live to be so old.

24:25.699 --> 24:27.299
How long do they live?

24:27.699 --> 24:30.259
Tortoises can live 100 years.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.738
Wow!

24:31.740 --> 24:33.300
Now, feeding time!

24:33.619 --> 24:36.177
Who knows what tortoises like to eat?

24:36.179 --> 24:37.338
Uh...

24:37.340 --> 24:39.937
Tortoises like to eat vegetables.

24:39.939 --> 24:42.619
That's right! That's why we feed them lettuce.

24:42.899 --> 24:45.780
Mr. Lion is feeding
the tortoises lettuce.

24:48.540 --> 24:52.857
But of course, children,
not all animals eat vegetables.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.659
That's right, Mrs. Wildebeest!

24:54.939 --> 24:57.379
My name is Madame Gazelle!

24:57.619 --> 24:59.697
Sorry. Gazelle, Wildebeest,

24:59.699 --> 25:02.939
for some reason
I always get those two mixed up.

25:03.219 --> 25:05.298
Mr. Lion,

25:05.300 --> 25:07.538
what animal will we see next?

25:07.540 --> 25:10.780
I'll give you a clue. It lives in water.

25:11.060 --> 25:13.859
- Is it a whale?
- Or a shark?

25:14.219 --> 25:16.498
Wait and see!

25:18.459 --> 25:20.779
Look carefully into the water.

25:21.179 --> 25:24.738
- I can't see anything.
- There's nothing in there.

25:24.740 --> 25:28.498
Wait, I think I see something.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.457
Ah! Crocodile!

25:30.459 --> 25:32.419
Hello, I'm Mrs. Crocodile!

25:32.699 --> 25:35.179
I'm the keeper in charge of the penguins.

25:35.419 --> 25:38.617
Aw, penguins!

25:38.619 --> 25:42.217
Adorable, aren't they?
And now it's their feeding time.

25:42.219 --> 25:44.217
Penguins eat fish.

25:44.219 --> 25:45.818
Ooh!

25:45.820 --> 25:48.460
Penguins are very good at catching.

25:49.899 --> 25:52.300
And waddling!

25:54.500 --> 25:56.460
And they like to swim!

25:56.780 --> 25:58.538
If you look through the glass wall,

25:58.540 --> 26:01.338
you can see the penguins
swimming underwater!

26:01.340 --> 26:02.457
Wow!

26:02.459 --> 26:04.457
They're really good at swimming.

26:04.459 --> 26:08.058
Yes, that's why we have this fancy pool
for them.

26:08.060 --> 26:12.937
Very interesting.
Thank you, Mrs. Crocodile and Mr. Lion.

26:12.939 --> 26:15.657
- It's our pleasure, Mrs. Wildebeest.
- Gazelle!

26:15.659 --> 26:17.300
Of course, yes, Gazelle.

26:19.419 --> 26:21.820
What animal are we meeting next?

26:22.100 --> 26:25.260
I can see it! It's very tall!

26:25.500 --> 26:27.098
It's a giraffe!

26:27.100 --> 26:31.179
Yes, that's my Dad! He's a keeper at the zoo.

26:31.500 --> 26:35.578
- Hello! I'm Mr. Giraffe.
- Hello, Mr. Giraffe.

26:35.580 --> 26:38.377
What sort of animal are you looking after?

26:38.379 --> 26:40.018
See if you can guess.

26:42.659 --> 26:44.619
Look up there, there's a net!

26:44.980 --> 26:48.058
It must be a flying, wild animal.

26:48.060 --> 26:50.978
It must be hiding, watching us.

26:50.980 --> 26:53.660
Waiting... To pounce!

26:54.020 --> 26:56.778
Ooh! Butterflies!

26:56.780 --> 26:59.340
Mr. Giraffe looks after the butterflies.

26:59.619 --> 27:02.260
Is it the butterflies' feeding time?

27:02.500 --> 27:05.937
Yes, and the butterflies
get all the food they need

27:05.939 --> 27:07.697
from these flowers.

27:07.699 --> 27:12.498
It is amazing they can live on
just the food from flowers.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.420
I wish I could get by just eating flowers.

27:15.980 --> 27:18.217
- Yes.
- All this talk of eating

27:18.219 --> 27:19.937
has made me quite hungry!

27:19.939 --> 27:22.939
Me, too! Well, it's our feeding time now.

27:23.219 --> 27:25.818
What's for lunch today, Mr. Lion?

27:25.820 --> 27:29.338
Ho-ho! Lunch boxes for everyone!

27:29.340 --> 27:32.419
Sandwiches, fruit juice and an apple!

27:32.740 --> 27:35.778
Little picnics in boxes!

27:35.780 --> 27:38.018
- Tuck in, everyone!
- Hooray!

27:39.100 --> 27:41.978
Mr. Lion loves feeding time at the zoo.

27:41.980 --> 27:45.060
Everyone loves feeding time at the zoo.

27:46.020 --> 27:49.220
What are you doing, Daisy?

27:49.699 --> 27:52.859
I'm being a penguin.

27:53.500 --> 27:56.900
- Oh, yes. We can all be penguins, too!
- Oh!

27:57.139 --> 28:00.177
- Let's copy Daisy.
- Oh, yes, come on, everyone.

28:02.659 --> 28:04.298
Come on, join in with us!

28:07.939 --> 28:10.139
Oh, that was very good.

28:11.219 --> 28:14.419
Okay, now it's your turn, George.
What animal are you going to be?

28:16.580 --> 28:18.740
Dine-saw! Grr!

28:19.780 --> 28:23.137
Dinosaurs aren't in the zoo, George!

28:23.139 --> 28:28.617
No, but we could have some dinosaurs
right here.

28:28.619 --> 28:31.498
Shall we all be dinosaurs
with George?

28:31.500 --> 28:34.058
Let's see your dinosaur claws

28:34.060 --> 28:36.457
and let's hear your dinosaur roars!

28:36.459 --> 28:38.377
Come on, everyone! Roar!

28:41.500 --> 28:43.540
Wowee!

28:43.899 --> 28:48.937
Daisy, I can see some daddy dinosaurs.

28:48.939 --> 28:50.058
Oh, yes.

28:50.060 --> 28:54.500
Come on, Daddies, let's hear your
big daddy dinosaur roar as well!

28:54.820 --> 28:55.978
Ready?

29:01.100 --> 29:06.139
Oh, wow, Peppa, there's lots
of mummy dinosaurs, too.

29:06.379 --> 29:07.580
Oh, yes!

29:07.980 --> 29:09.420
Come on, mummy dinosaurs,

29:09.780 --> 29:14.139
if you join in as well,
we'll make a really loud roar.

29:14.500 --> 29:15.738
Ready, everyone?

29:19.740 --> 29:22.900
- Wowee!
- That was loud.

29:23.419 --> 29:27.820
Yes, Peppa, but I think the boys and girls

29:28.219 --> 29:31.299
can be even louder on their own.

29:31.820 --> 29:33.139
Are you ready, boys and girls?

29:33.419 --> 29:38.697
Let's make the biggest
dinosaur roar ever! Ready?

29:41.659 --> 29:42.818
Louder!

29:45.100 --> 29:46.417
And louder!

29:50.219 --> 29:53.659
Wowee! Phew!

29:54.500 --> 29:57.420
Okay, so I was a penguin.

29:58.020 --> 30:00.018
George was a dinosaur.

30:00.020 --> 30:01.619
What animal do you want to be, Peppa?

30:02.139 --> 30:04.259
Um, I don't know.

30:04.659 --> 30:08.739
Hmm. Oh, perhaps I can find an idea

30:09.179 --> 30:11.299
in... Here!

30:12.219 --> 30:16.177
Um, how about a duck?

30:16.179 --> 30:18.619
Oh, yes! I want to be a duck!

30:19.020 --> 30:20.580
Let's all make a sound like a duck!

30:23.619 --> 30:25.578
Come on, everyone, join in with me.

30:29.179 --> 30:31.217
- Daisy?
- Yes, Peppa?

30:31.219 --> 30:32.979
What other animals have you got?

30:33.219 --> 30:35.659
Um, how about...

30:36.859 --> 30:39.300
Oh, an owl?

30:39.619 --> 30:42.979
Oh, yes! I want to be an owl.

30:43.500 --> 30:47.420
Well, they go twit-twoo, twit-twoo.

30:47.780 --> 30:49.500
Come on, everyone, join in with me.

30:49.859 --> 30:54.060
Twit-twoo! Twit-twoo! Twit-twoo!

30:54.820 --> 30:57.778
- That was very good.
- Is that all the animals?

30:57.780 --> 31:00.940
Well, no. How about...

31:01.540 --> 31:02.740
Oh!

31:03.780 --> 31:05.338
A tortoise!

31:05.340 --> 31:07.617
Yes! I want to be a tortoise

31:07.619 --> 31:10.419
and everyone can make
a tortoise noise with me.

31:10.780 --> 31:14.340
Um, what sound does a tortoise make, Daisy?

31:15.179 --> 31:18.259
Oh! Dine-saw! Grr!

31:18.780 --> 31:23.258
George, tortoises don't roar,
but it would be funny if they did!

31:26.300 --> 31:28.657
I think I want to be something jumpy.

31:28.659 --> 31:31.100
Oh, yes! Well, you're really good at jumping.

31:31.540 --> 31:33.538
Um...

31:33.540 --> 31:36.899
And I know just the animal for you, Peppa.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.659
A monkey!

31:43.980 --> 31:45.620
We can all be monkeys together!

31:45.939 --> 31:48.340
Join in, everyone!

32:41.820 --> 32:43.498
And this is Daddy Pig.

32:45.500 --> 32:47.300
Peppa Pig!

32:50.020 --> 32:54.058
Peppa has come to visit
Kylie Kangaroo in Australia.

32:55.139 --> 32:57.379
Do you think we should
have told them we were coming?

32:57.740 --> 33:02.177
- Hello, Mr. Kangaroo!
- Oh, Mr. Pig! What a surprise!

33:02.179 --> 33:05.018
You did say if we were ever passing
we should visit.

33:05.020 --> 33:08.818
Oh, yeah. For sure.
Kylie, look who's just dropped by!

33:08.820 --> 33:11.298
- Hello, Peppa!
- Hello, Kylie!

33:11.300 --> 33:12.778
Hello, George!

33:12.780 --> 33:14.657
Remember my little brother Joey?

33:14.659 --> 33:17.457
Dine-saw! Grr!

33:17.459 --> 33:20.298
Grrr! Crocodile!

33:20.300 --> 33:22.740
We're just going for a picnic.
Do you want to come along?

33:22.980 --> 33:24.460
Yes, please!

33:26.100 --> 33:28.778
The Kangaroo family
have an aeroplane.

33:28.780 --> 33:31.538
- Wow!
- You have a plane!

33:31.540 --> 33:34.500
Yes, we're going to fly to the picnic spot.

33:34.740 --> 33:38.018
All aboard! Everybody ready?

33:38.020 --> 33:40.900
- Yes!
- Then, let's go!

33:43.179 --> 33:45.258
Whee!

33:46.859 --> 33:49.177
Where are we going for the picnic?

33:49.179 --> 33:51.818
To a special place in the Outback.

33:51.820 --> 33:53.177
Ooh.

33:53.179 --> 33:57.298

34:11.980 --> 34:14.380
I love the Outback!

34:15.020 --> 34:17.219
Um, what is the Outback?

34:17.739 --> 34:19.697
We're flying over it now.

34:19.699 --> 34:22.617
Oh, it looks like a desert.

34:22.619 --> 34:27.617
It kind of is. But the Outback is also
a special, magical place for us.

34:27.619 --> 34:28.659
Ooh!

34:32.380 --> 34:34.217
Here is our picnic spot!

34:34.219 --> 34:36.458
With our special picnic tree.

34:36.460 --> 34:38.177
It's the only tree for miles.

34:39.420 --> 34:43.217
Wow! It's hot! Have you got any water?

34:43.219 --> 34:45.179
Too right! We all need water.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.177
Water is a precious thing in the Outback.

34:48.179 --> 34:49.257
So don't...

34:49.259 --> 34:52.018
Ah! Nice and cool.

34:52.020 --> 34:53.898
- ...waste it.
- Daddy!

34:53.900 --> 34:57.660
You have to drink it, not splash it around!

34:57.980 --> 34:59.300
Ah.

34:59.619 --> 35:03.420
No worries. Let's cook up
a good old-fashioned Australian picnic.

35:03.699 --> 35:05.058
Ooh, sounds lovely.

35:05.060 --> 35:07.418
Should we collect wood for the campfire?

35:07.420 --> 35:10.380
You don't need wood when you've got gas!

35:11.259 --> 35:14.098
Mr. Kangaroo has a gas barbecue.

35:14.100 --> 35:17.940
When we have a picnic,
Mrs. Duck always shows up.

35:18.259 --> 35:22.139
Ha! There's no chance of Mrs. Duck
showing up in the middle of a desert!

35:22.420 --> 35:24.780
Oh.

35:25.100 --> 35:27.617
It is a duck-billed platypus.

35:27.619 --> 35:32.018
Mrs. Duck-Billed Platypus
always shows up when we have picnics.

35:33.739 --> 35:36.938
Food's ready! Corn on the cob for everyone!

35:36.940 --> 35:38.300
Hooray!

35:38.779 --> 35:41.058
Peppa likes corn on the cob.

35:41.060 --> 35:43.697
Everyone likes corn on the cob!

35:43.699 --> 35:45.299
I think it's time for a game!

35:45.540 --> 35:48.257
Sure thing. I've brought a cricket bat.

35:48.259 --> 35:51.137
Oh, do you play cricket in Australia?

35:51.139 --> 35:54.900
Do we play cricket?
We're born playing cricket!

35:55.139 --> 35:56.900
Cricket!

35:57.580 --> 35:59.257
How do you play it?

35:59.259 --> 36:01.777
- You hit the ball with the bat.
- Ah.

36:01.779 --> 36:05.100
If we catch it, you're out! Ready, Dad?

36:06.380 --> 36:09.500
- You're out, Dad!
- Ha-ha! Your go, Peppa!

36:10.380 --> 36:13.020
Good shot, Peppa!

36:14.659 --> 36:18.737
Oh, dear.
The ball has landed in the tree.

36:18.739 --> 36:23.777
It's the only tree for miles
and our ball gets stuck in it!

36:23.779 --> 36:26.578
If I lift you up, Peppa,

36:26.580 --> 36:27.860
can you see the ball?

36:28.139 --> 36:32.699
Uh, a teddy bear is holding on to it!

36:32.980 --> 36:36.500
That's not a teddy bear, Peppa. That's a koala!

36:36.819 --> 36:38.418
Thanks, mate!

36:38.420 --> 36:42.060
That is the sweetest animal I've ever seen!

36:42.380 --> 36:44.418
But you are sweet, too,

36:44.420 --> 36:47.578
Mrs. Duck-Billed Platypus! Yes, you are!

36:48.860 --> 36:51.378
Okay, everybody! It's home time.

36:51.380 --> 36:53.540
You're staying at our house tonight, Peppa!

36:53.819 --> 36:55.219
Yippee!

36:57.540 --> 37:03.018
I loved our picnic in the Outback!
Can we do it again tomorrow?

37:03.020 --> 37:06.697
There are loads of other great things
we can do while you're here, Peppa.

37:06.699 --> 37:09.018
Oh, goody. Night-night!

37:09.020 --> 37:10.777
Night-night!

37:10.779 --> 37:12.578
Peppa and George are asleep

37:12.580 --> 37:15.980
after their first day on holiday
with Kylie Kangaroo.

37:20.580 --> 37:23.858
Peppa is on holiday
at Kylie Kangaroo's house.

37:23.860 --> 37:26.578
What are we going to do today, Kylie?

37:26.580 --> 37:27.940
We're going to the beach.

37:28.299 --> 37:31.617
Yippee! I love the beach!

37:34.259 --> 37:36.458
- Everybody ready?
- Yes!

37:36.460 --> 37:38.780
Then, let's go!

37:44.500 --> 37:46.219
This is the beach.

37:46.460 --> 37:51.098
Wow! Look at the sea and the waves!

37:53.100 --> 37:55.699
Yeah! You'll need life vests for the water!

37:56.619 --> 37:58.819
Dad, are we good to go surfing now?

37:59.060 --> 38:01.020
- You're all good!
- What is that?

38:01.460 --> 38:04.817
- It's a surf board.
- What do you do with it?

38:04.819 --> 38:07.657
You lie on it and the waves push you along.

38:07.659 --> 38:08.777
Ooh!

38:08.779 --> 38:11.378
Come on, Peppa. I'll teach you!

38:11.380 --> 38:15.260
It's easy to float because the board
is super floaty!

38:18.940 --> 38:21.619
The tricky bit is catching the wave.

38:21.940 --> 38:26.137
Ready, steady... Now, Peppa!

38:26.139 --> 38:27.938
Whoo-hoo!

38:27.940 --> 38:30.938
Kylie is being carried along by a wave!

38:30.940 --> 38:33.337
Whee!

38:33.339 --> 38:35.697
Don't miss the next one, Peppa!

38:35.699 --> 38:39.500
Ready, steady... Go!

38:39.900 --> 38:41.458
Whee!

38:41.460 --> 38:45.498
- Isn't it awesome?
- Yes! It's brilliant!

38:45.500 --> 38:47.300
Whee!

38:49.460 --> 38:52.938
Surfing is the best thing ever!

38:52.940 --> 38:56.538
It's true,
surfing is the best thing ever.

38:56.540 --> 39:00.378
Ready, steady, go!

39:00.380 --> 39:02.980
Whee!

39:05.219 --> 39:07.297
George wants to go surfing.

39:07.299 --> 39:10.898
Sorry, George, you're a bit too little
to go surfing.

39:10.900 --> 39:13.538
- Oh.
- The waves are getting too big

39:13.540 --> 39:15.380
for Peppa and Kylie.

39:15.980 --> 39:18.458
Oh, is it time to go home?

39:18.460 --> 39:19.697
Are you kidding?

39:19.699 --> 39:22.659
These waves are perfect
for grown-ups to surf!

39:31.139 --> 39:32.337
All right!

39:32.339 --> 39:34.418
That's proper surfing.

39:34.420 --> 39:36.020
Whoo-hoo!

39:36.259 --> 39:38.657
These waves are awesome!

39:38.659 --> 39:40.018
Wow!

39:40.020 --> 39:42.177
Kylie? Where's your little brother?

39:42.179 --> 39:43.899
He's out there with Mum.

39:44.139 --> 39:46.540
Having fun, Joey?

39:50.139 --> 39:52.137
Your turn to surf, guys!

39:52.139 --> 39:54.737
Thank you, but I'm quite happy to watch.

39:54.739 --> 39:56.299
Why don't you have a go, Mr. Pig?

39:56.619 --> 39:59.139
Why not? It does look fun!

39:59.860 --> 40:01.980
Oh, the waves have gone.

40:03.179 --> 40:06.859
Too bad, Mr. Pig, looks like
you've missed your chance to surf today.

40:07.179 --> 40:09.137
Oh, that's a shame.

40:09.139 --> 40:12.617
But it's just right for little George
to go paddling in.

40:12.619 --> 40:15.617
I'll come with you, George!

40:15.619 --> 40:18.458
No surfing, George,

40:18.460 --> 40:21.297
but you can sit on me instead.

40:21.299 --> 40:24.659
George likes sitting
on top of Daddy Pig.

40:25.139 --> 40:27.339
Look at that wave coming!

40:29.540 --> 40:32.018
Crikey! It's a big one!

40:32.020 --> 40:35.177
Daddy! There's a big wave coming!

40:35.179 --> 40:36.817
Wave! Wave! Wave!

40:36.819 --> 40:40.018
- What's that?
- Wave! Wave! Wave! Wave!

40:40.020 --> 40:43.297
I think they want us
to wave, George.

40:43.299 --> 40:45.499
Coo-ee!

40:47.100 --> 40:48.217
Coo-ee!

40:48.219 --> 40:50.060
Whoa!

40:51.500 --> 40:54.980
George is using Daddy Pig
as a surfboard.

40:56.020 --> 40:58.617
Wow! George has got great balance!

41:02.259 --> 41:03.498
Hooray!

41:03.500 --> 41:05.697
You're a natural surfer, George!

41:05.699 --> 41:07.659
Maybe you can teach me a few tricks?

41:09.420 --> 41:11.498
George is the best!

41:18.659 --> 41:21.418
I loved surfing, Mummy!

41:21.420 --> 41:24.180
Yes, what a fantastic holiday we're having!

41:24.540 --> 41:27.337
So, what's planned for tomorrow?

41:27.339 --> 41:30.217
Are you, uh, staying another day?

41:30.219 --> 41:32.219
I could stay here forever!

41:32.460 --> 41:35.500
Well, I do have to go to work tomorrow.

41:35.739 --> 41:37.259
They can come along, too.

41:37.619 --> 41:38.777
Okay.

41:38.779 --> 41:41.619
- I suppose that might be...
- Hooray!

41:41.860 --> 41:44.657
Peppa is having
a lovely long holiday

41:44.659 --> 41:46.420
with Kylie Kangaroo.

41:51.139 --> 41:54.217
Ahoy there, make way for the pirates!

41:54.219 --> 41:56.578
Are we the pirates, Daisy?

41:56.580 --> 42:01.340
We all are! And pirates go like this... Ah-harr!

42:01.619 --> 42:03.697
Ah-harr!

42:05.139 --> 42:08.177
George says he likes being a pirate.

42:08.179 --> 42:09.540
Ah-harr!

42:09.819 --> 42:11.498
Ah-harr!

42:11.500 --> 42:13.177
We're off to sail the seas!

42:13.179 --> 42:14.899
We're off to sail the seas!

42:16.219 --> 42:17.379
Where are we going?

42:17.619 --> 42:19.339
To find treasure!

42:19.779 --> 42:21.819
Treasure!

42:22.259 --> 42:23.739
Ah-harr!

42:25.060 --> 42:29.657
But we can't sail the seas
without some wind in our sail. Hmm.

42:29.659 --> 42:32.739
Maybe I could blow the sail
to make the boat go?

42:36.339 --> 42:38.019
That's not enough.

42:38.819 --> 42:41.379
I know! All our friends could help!

42:41.860 --> 42:44.098
- What a good idea!
- Okay, everyone.

42:44.100 --> 42:47.898
After three, you all blow
as hard as you can, ready?

42:47.900 --> 42:52.058
One, two, three, blow!

42:56.659 --> 42:59.139
It's working!

42:59.580 --> 43:01.898
You did it! Oh, thank you.

43:01.900 --> 43:02.900
Full speed ahead!

43:03.860 --> 43:05.498
Full speed ahead!

43:07.779 --> 43:09.580
What now, Daisy?

43:10.020 --> 43:12.380

I'm Peppa Pig!

45:25.699 --> 45:28.337
This is my little brother George.

45:28.339 --> 45:30.737
This is Mummy Pig.

45:30.739 --> 45:32.378
And this is Daddy Pig.

45:34.540 --> 45:36.179
Peppa Pig!

45:39.659 --> 45:42.018
Peppa is on holiday in Australia,

45:42.020 --> 45:43.697
at Kylie Kangaroo's house.

45:43.699 --> 45:46.697
I love it here at your house, Kylie!

45:46.699 --> 45:49.299
Yes, I could stay here forever!

45:50.219 --> 45:52.500
It's great having you all stay,

45:52.739 --> 45:55.259
but I will have to go to work today.

45:55.540 --> 45:58.378
What is your job, Mrs. Kangaroo?

45:58.380 --> 46:00.337
I'm a marine biologist.

46:00.339 --> 46:01.737
What's that?

46:01.739 --> 46:05.378
I study sea creatures,
like these little fish here.

46:05.380 --> 46:07.700
Ooh! A fish tank!

46:08.100 --> 46:10.779
But the fish I study don't live in a tank,

46:11.020 --> 46:12.300
they live in the sea.

46:12.580 --> 46:16.458
Do the fishes in the sea
have little bridges to swim through

46:16.460 --> 46:18.617
and treasure to play with?

46:18.619 --> 46:23.578
No, Peppa, that's just the sort of stuff
people put in fish tanks.

46:23.580 --> 46:25.699
Would you all like to come
and see where I work?

46:25.940 --> 46:29.978
Yes, please!
I've been to where my daddy works.

46:29.980 --> 46:34.498
There was a telephone, lots of paper
and colouring pens.

46:34.500 --> 46:37.177
It was a very nice office.

46:37.179 --> 46:40.339
I think you'll find my office is pretty fun, too.

46:46.699 --> 46:49.098
This is my office!

46:49.100 --> 46:51.940
- Where?
- There, Peppa, the sea!

46:52.339 --> 46:55.297
I've got the best office in the world!

46:55.299 --> 46:57.777
But how can you work in the sea?

46:57.779 --> 47:00.459
With this submarine!

47:02.460 --> 47:03.697
Wow!

47:03.699 --> 47:04.978
Do you want a ride?

47:04.980 --> 47:06.540
Yes, please!

47:06.940 --> 47:08.860
Okay! Hop in!

47:20.500 --> 47:21.978
Wow!

47:21.980 --> 47:24.380
It's all the colours of the rainbow!

47:25.219 --> 47:31.098
That's coral. Coral is made of
lots and lots of tiny creatures.

47:31.100 --> 47:32.177
Ooh!

47:32.179 --> 47:36.337
And the coral stretches for miles and miles.

47:36.339 --> 47:41.299
- We call it the Great Barrier Reef.
- It's my job to keep the coral safe.

47:41.980 --> 47:44.538
Can we take some coral home with us?

47:44.540 --> 47:48.578
Sorry, Peppa.
We can look, but we mustn't touch.

47:48.580 --> 47:52.058
If every visitor took a little bit of coral home...

47:52.060 --> 47:54.538
Soon all the coral would be gone!

47:54.540 --> 47:58.617
We must never,
never take anything away from here.

47:58.619 --> 48:02.418
- Ah.
- Look! Little fish!

48:02.420 --> 48:06.177
- They're clownfish.
- Clownfish?

48:06.179 --> 48:08.617
They do look quite funny.

48:10.139 --> 48:11.337
Look over there!

48:11.339 --> 48:14.018
A big blue starfish!

48:14.020 --> 48:17.657
- There's a tiny red one!
- And a spiky green one!

48:17.659 --> 48:20.018
- What's that?
- That's a turtle.

48:20.020 --> 48:21.300
Ooh!

48:22.739 --> 48:26.419
Hello, Mrs. Turtle, how are you today?

48:28.580 --> 48:33.137
You see how lucky I am to work
in such an amazing place, Peppa?

48:33.139 --> 48:36.578
Look! A little bridge,

48:36.580 --> 48:38.817
just like in your fish tank!

48:38.819 --> 48:43.337
Ho-ho! You're right, Peppa!
It is quite like the fish tank here.

48:43.339 --> 48:45.817
Except there's no treasure chest, of course!

48:47.259 --> 48:49.018
What have you seen, George?

48:49.020 --> 48:53.659
It looks like a chest, full of gold coins!

48:53.900 --> 48:55.297
Wow!

48:55.299 --> 48:57.619
George has found
a treasure chest!

48:57.860 --> 49:01.700
You see, Daddy?
Everything is the same as the fish tank.

49:02.020 --> 49:03.737
Uh, yes.

49:03.739 --> 49:06.419
That gold must be worth a fortune!

49:06.779 --> 49:09.299
I think I can get it.

49:10.339 --> 49:13.219
But you said we must
never take anything away!

49:13.980 --> 49:17.137
I meant natural things that belong here.

49:17.139 --> 49:20.257
That's right.
These gold coins don't belong here

49:20.259 --> 49:22.177
so, we need to remove them.

49:22.179 --> 49:26.098
- Ah.
- It will all go to a good cause.

49:26.100 --> 49:29.858
Yes, it'll pay for lots more marine research!

49:29.860 --> 49:31.180
Hooray!

49:32.540 --> 49:35.058
That was a good day at the office!

49:35.060 --> 49:38.619
We saw coral and fishes and a turtle!

49:40.819 --> 49:42.580
This is a great holiday!

49:43.100 --> 49:45.058
I don't want it to ever end!

49:45.060 --> 49:48.380
But you are going
to leave sometime, right?

49:48.819 --> 49:52.859
Oh, not that you aren't welcome
to stay as long as you like, of course.

49:53.860 --> 49:55.780
Thank you, Mrs. Kangaroo!

49:56.779 --> 49:59.697
This holiday is the best!

50:00.980 --> 50:05.300
Peppa is having
a lovely holiday with Kylie Kangaroo.

50:09.779 --> 50:13.219
It is the end of
Peppa's holiday with Kylie Kangaroo.

50:15.540 --> 50:18.380
Why don't you children go and play
in the garden while we pack?

50:18.659 --> 50:21.339
Okay, Mummy.

50:22.299 --> 50:24.259
This holiday is the best!

50:25.020 --> 50:27.418
I've loved having you stay, Peppa!

50:27.420 --> 50:31.137
I wish we didn't have to go back home.

50:31.139 --> 50:34.299
Don't be sad. I got you a goodbye present!

50:34.580 --> 50:37.657
- Ooh, is it a banana?
- No!

50:37.659 --> 50:39.659
- Dine-saw?
- No!

50:40.500 --> 50:44.780
- It's a thing!
- Yes, but it's not just any old thing.

50:45.100 --> 50:48.380
- It's a boomerang!
- A boomerang?

50:48.659 --> 50:53.179
Boomerangs are very special to us.
We've used them since olden times.

50:53.619 --> 50:59.458
Wow! Thank you, Kylie.
Uh, what do you do with it?

50:59.460 --> 51:02.380
- You play catch with it.
- Like a ball?

51:02.619 --> 51:06.219
Sort of. But when you throw a boomerang,
it comes back to you!

51:06.540 --> 51:08.380
That's impossible!

51:10.659 --> 51:12.619
I told you it was impossible.

51:12.860 --> 51:14.660
You need to throw it harder.

51:15.020 --> 51:16.820
George, you have a go.

51:20.940 --> 51:23.060
- Oh.
- It doesn't work.

51:23.460 --> 51:26.578
You're just not throwing it right.

51:26.580 --> 51:28.617
You need to throw it hard!

51:28.619 --> 51:30.339
What, like this?

51:32.739 --> 51:34.979
- Watch out!
- Whoa!

51:37.900 --> 51:40.297
Ha! I did it!

51:40.299 --> 51:43.379
The boomerang has flown
all the way back to Peppa.

51:43.699 --> 51:47.538
- What was that?
- It's a boomerang, Daddy!

51:47.540 --> 51:49.219
Ah, yes.

51:49.460 --> 51:52.659
You have to throw it hard
and then it comes back!

51:53.100 --> 51:55.020
Allow me to show you, Mr. Pig.

51:55.540 --> 51:59.619
Are you ready? One, two, three, throw!

52:05.779 --> 52:08.177
So, when does it come back?

52:09.779 --> 52:11.498
Ah.

52:11.500 --> 52:14.659
Keep a good look out, kids,
that boomerang could be anywhere!

52:16.420 --> 52:20.458
- I think we might have found it.
- Hello!

52:20.460 --> 52:23.777
This is Mr. Wallaby.
He is the next-door neighbour.

52:23.779 --> 52:27.378
Uh, hi, Mr. Wallaby.
I was, uh, just teaching these kids

52:27.380 --> 52:28.817
how to throw a boomerang.

52:28.819 --> 52:32.018
- Sorry about your window.
- Well, there's no worries there, mate.

52:32.020 --> 52:35.098
What's a broken window
between friends?

52:35.100 --> 52:37.659
Mr. Wallaby
is a very nice neighbour.

52:37.900 --> 52:40.340
- Don't let it happen again, though!
- Thanks!

52:40.659 --> 52:42.058
Like I was saying.

52:42.060 --> 52:44.940
To throw a boomerang,
you need to throw it hard!

52:45.179 --> 52:46.899
What, like this?

52:47.540 --> 52:49.060
That's it, Daddy!

52:50.299 --> 52:52.098
It's coming back!

52:52.100 --> 52:54.337
Here she comes. Here she comes!

52:54.339 --> 52:57.059
- Catch it, Mr. Pig!
- Ah, missed it!

52:57.659 --> 52:59.978
Aw, no.

52:59.980 --> 53:02.619
The boomerang has broken
another window.

53:02.980 --> 53:05.139
Well,
I think we should be going,

53:05.580 --> 53:07.418
while you've still got some windows left.

53:07.420 --> 53:10.740
Hey, no! You can't leave until I've had a go!

53:11.100 --> 53:14.580
Let me show your mates
how a boomerang should be thrown.

53:15.020 --> 53:16.337
Thanks, Mr. Wallaby.

53:16.339 --> 53:19.938
Ah, don't mention it.
That's what neighbours are for.

53:21.819 --> 53:26.378
Now, the trick is you need to throw
the boomerang more upright.

53:26.380 --> 53:29.177
- Like this!
- Ooh!

53:29.179 --> 53:31.578
It's good, it's good...

53:31.580 --> 53:33.100
It's a good throw.

53:33.739 --> 53:37.098
Here it comes. It's good. It's looking... Oh, no!

53:37.100 --> 53:39.460
Someone catch it!

53:39.860 --> 53:43.340
Oh, dear, the boomerang
has broken another window.

53:43.580 --> 53:47.337
So, um, we absolutely must be going now.

53:47.339 --> 53:49.297
Do you want any help
mending your windows?

53:49.299 --> 53:51.257
Ah, no worries, mate.

53:51.259 --> 53:52.540
That time it was my fault.

53:52.900 --> 53:55.898
Mr. Wallaby really is
a very nice neighbour.

53:55.900 --> 53:57.938
- See you later!
- ALL Bye-bye!

53:57.940 --> 53:59.740
See you later!

54:01.299 --> 54:03.098
Where have you all been?

54:03.100 --> 54:05.257
Ah, just throwing boomerangs, you know.

54:05.259 --> 54:07.458
Mr. Wallaby's windows have all been broken.

54:07.460 --> 54:09.137
We had a great time, didn't we, kids?

54:09.139 --> 54:10.978
Yes!

54:10.980 --> 54:13.257
I've loved having you stay, Peppa.

54:13.259 --> 54:16.458
We've loved it, too. Haven't we, George?

54:18.020 --> 54:19.817
Don't forget your present!

54:19.819 --> 54:22.177
Oh, yes! The boomerang!

54:22.179 --> 54:24.137
Thank you!

54:24.139 --> 54:25.498
Come back again!

54:25.500 --> 54:28.378
I will, just like the boomerang!

54:30.540 --> 54:33.378
Peppa has had
the best holiday ever

54:33.380 --> 54:35.860
with Kylie Kangaroo.

54:36.500 --> 54:41.578
So, if that's the sofa and... Oh!

54:41.580 --> 54:44.380
And that's the garden, then...

54:45.100 --> 54:48.098
Daisy, you're holding the map upside-down!

54:48.100 --> 54:50.657
Oh! Silly me!

54:53.020 --> 54:54.337
That's better!

54:54.339 --> 54:56.058
We're looking for pirate treasure!

54:56.060 --> 54:58.619
Peppa and George
have drawn us a treasure map.

54:59.100 --> 55:01.458
Dine-saw.

55:01.460 --> 55:03.540
George has hidden his dinosaur.

55:05.460 --> 55:07.617
Oh, yes, a dinosaur.

55:07.619 --> 55:10.179
- Grrr!
- And a banana.

55:10.420 --> 55:11.980
That's not a banana.

55:12.219 --> 55:13.939
It's my boomerang!

55:14.420 --> 55:16.820
Oh, your boomerang! Of course.

55:17.299 --> 55:21.337
Now, close your eyes whilst I go hide it.

55:21.339 --> 55:22.858
Okay.

55:26.179 --> 55:27.379
Ready!

55:27.619 --> 55:29.580
Right. I'm going to need your help.

55:29.980 --> 55:33.737
If I'm very close to finding
the treasure can you all shout, "Hot!"

55:33.739 --> 55:35.060
Hot!

55:35.299 --> 55:37.817
And if I'm a long way away, can you shout...

55:38.940 --> 55:40.659
Oh, that's right, George.

55:40.980 --> 55:43.098
Can you all shout, "Cold!"

55:43.100 --> 55:44.458
Cold!

55:44.460 --> 55:47.060
Okay, here we go. Hmm.

55:47.339 --> 55:49.418
Let's look for Peppa's boomerang treasure.

55:50.819 --> 55:54.580
Now, where could the boomerang be?

55:55.179 --> 55:57.940
Hmm. Oh, Peppa!

55:58.299 --> 56:00.379
It could be anywhere.

56:00.619 --> 56:03.339
Um, I think I'll try over here.

56:04.219 --> 56:05.617
Am I hot or am I cold?

56:05.619 --> 56:08.058
- Cold!
- Oh, cold?

56:08.060 --> 56:09.697
Then, it's not over here.

56:09.699 --> 56:11.538
Okay, I'll go back here, ready?

56:11.540 --> 56:13.697
- No. Here...
- Still cold.

56:13.699 --> 56:16.018
- Still cold?
- Still cold.

56:16.020 --> 56:18.098
- Um, keep shouting.
- Cold!

56:18.100 --> 56:21.257
Um, maybe it's behind the curtains?

56:21.259 --> 56:23.779
- No.
- Oh, no.

56:24.619 --> 56:26.617
Um, okay, then...

56:26.619 --> 56:29.538
- Warmer.
- Oh, warmer?

56:29.540 --> 56:33.858
Then, it must be somewhere over here?

56:33.860 --> 56:35.817
- Warmer.
- Maybe it's on the shelves.

56:35.819 --> 56:37.697
Nope! Cold!

56:37.699 --> 56:38.938
Oh? Cold?

56:38.940 --> 56:40.737
- Freezing!
- Freezing? Oh.

56:40.739 --> 56:43.578
Then, it's not over... Oh.

56:43.580 --> 56:45.378
- Hot!
- Hot, hot, hot!

56:45.380 --> 56:47.180
Then, I think it might be under the...

56:47.500 --> 56:49.418
Oh!

56:49.420 --> 56:51.297
- Hot!
- Mmm.

56:51.299 --> 56:54.418
I wonder where the boomerang could be?

56:54.420 --> 56:56.617
Hot!

56:56.619 --> 57:00.020
What's this? It's Peppa's treasure!

57:02.819 --> 57:06.737
Oh, Peppa, that treasure
was quite difficult to find.

57:08.900 --> 57:12.177
George wants you
to find his dinosaur treasure now.

57:12.179 --> 57:15.219
Okay. Of course.

57:15.580 --> 57:17.860
Hmm. Let's check the map.

57:18.619 --> 57:22.420
Right, so, it should be somewhere

57:22.739 --> 57:26.179
over... There.

57:26.819 --> 57:29.058
- Nope!
- Am I hot or am I cold?

57:29.060 --> 57:31.217
- Cold!
- Cold?

57:31.219 --> 57:33.418
Ah. Is it in the toy box?

57:33.420 --> 57:36.297
- Still cold!
- Still cold?

57:36.299 --> 57:39.978
Hmm, then, maybe it's...

57:39.980 --> 57:41.578
Warmer...

57:41.580 --> 57:44.058
- Warmer?
- Warmer!

57:44.060 --> 57:46.498
Oh! Maybe...

57:46.500 --> 57:48.378
- Colder!
- Oh! Colder?

57:48.380 --> 57:50.257
- Then, it's not upstairs...
- Cold!

57:50.259 --> 57:53.777
Oh! Where is it?

57:55.460 --> 57:58.498
Maybe it's in the garden.

57:58.500 --> 58:01.177
- Freezing!
- Oh. Then...

58:02.699 --> 58:07.137
Then, it must be somewhere near the sofa.

58:07.139 --> 58:10.098
Warmer. Warmer.

58:10.100 --> 58:11.858
Really hot, Daisy!

58:11.860 --> 58:13.817
- I think I might know where it is!
- Boiling!

58:13.819 --> 58:16.617
I think the dinosaur treasure should be right...

58:16.619 --> 58:18.179
- Oh.
- But...

58:18.580 --> 58:20.137
Grrr!

58:20.139 --> 58:23.297
Oh, well done, George!

58:23.299 --> 58:26.858
You had it all the time!

58:26.860 --> 58:31.177
George loves his dinosaur so much
he didn't want to let it go!

58:31.179 --> 58:33.898
Dine-saw! Grr!

58:39.779 --> 58:41.777
I'm Peppa Pig!

58:41.779 --> 58:44.418
This is my little brother George.

58:44.420 --> 58:46.817
This is Mummy Pig.

58:46.819 --> 58:48.259
And this is Daddy Pig.

58:50.500 --> 58:52.340
Peppa Pig!

58:54.779 --> 58:57.217
Peppa and her friends
are at playgroup.

58:57.219 --> 59:02.378
Children, today you will use
your imaginations

59:02.380 --> 59:04.378
to move to music.

59:04.380 --> 59:05.900
Ooh!

59:06.580 --> 59:09.940
What does this music make you think of?

59:12.100 --> 59:14.378
It makes me think of a piano.

59:14.380 --> 59:15.578
Okay.

59:15.580 --> 59:17.860
It makes me think of music.

59:18.100 --> 59:21.617
Right. Use your imaginations.

59:21.619 --> 59:25.217
What pictures did the music
make you think of?

59:25.219 --> 59:27.817
It makes me think of a cherry tree,

59:27.819 --> 59:32.217
swaying in the wind,
on top of a beautiful mountain.

59:32.219 --> 59:33.859
Wonderful, Rebecca!

59:34.139 --> 59:38.538
So now I would like you all
to imagine you are that tree,

59:38.540 --> 59:42.699
rooted to the rocky mountaintop,
bending in the wind!

59:43.219 --> 59:44.580
You are a tree!

59:45.060 --> 59:47.538
Your feet are rooted to the ground!

59:47.540 --> 59:52.900
Feel the wind in your branches
and the sun on your leaves!

59:53.299 --> 59:55.139
You are a tree!

59:56.020 --> 59:58.058
Very good, children.

59:58.060 --> 01:00:01.219
I saw some lovely trees
on mountaintops there!

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:04.619
Now, listen to this piece of music.

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:12.737
What did that music make you think of?

01:00:12.739 --> 01:00:15.458
Remember to use your imaginations.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.177
- I know!
- Pedro?

01:00:17.179 --> 01:00:19.938
Is the answer a cherry tree,

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:22.737
swaying on the top of a beautiful mountain?

01:00:22.739 --> 01:00:26.100
Hmm, but this music was quicker, wasn't it?

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:29.300
A cherry tree swaying quickly?

01:00:29.699 --> 01:00:33.578
- Danny?
- It reminded me of a marching band.

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.460
Very good, Danny!

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:42.179
This music has a very strong beat
for stepping in time.

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:46.740
Everyone, find something to bang
from the music trolley!

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.179
Imagine you are in that band,

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.217
marching along, beating your drums!

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:55.697
That's it!

01:00:55.699 --> 01:00:58.498
Marvellous marching, children!

01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.938
Wasn't that fun?

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:02.177
Yes, Madame Gazelle.

01:01:02.179 --> 01:01:05.538
The next piece of music is a little bit different.

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:08.378
Remember, I want you to listen to it carefully

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:11.380
and think about how it makes you feel.

01:01:16.659 --> 01:01:19.418
This music is about space!

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:22.697
It's an alien birthday party!

01:01:22.699 --> 01:01:25.257
Ugh, what is wrong with this machine?

01:01:25.259 --> 01:01:28.058
Robots from the future!

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:32.817
Hello, I'm an alien.

01:01:32.819 --> 01:01:34.418
Bleep, bleep, bloop, bloop!

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:37.737
I am a robot. I am a robot.

01:01:37.739 --> 01:01:40.418
Zing! Zong! Zing!

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:43.217
This is the best music yet!

01:01:43.219 --> 01:01:45.978
No, no. I think the machine is broken.

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:47.540
There!

01:01:49.179 --> 01:01:53.379
Now, tell me, how does this make you feel?

01:01:53.699 --> 01:01:56.337
It makes me feel a bit bored.

01:01:56.339 --> 01:01:59.978
It makes me feel tired.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:02.777
Has the music machine gone wrong again?

01:02:02.779 --> 01:02:05.418
No! This is music!

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:10.137
It reminds me of a lovely garden
on a hot summer day.

01:02:10.139 --> 01:02:13.098
A young man, a broken heart...

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:15.858
Please, can we have the space music again?
