Hey, nice fire.
Where'd you get
those rocks?

00:30.865 --> 00:33.799
Ah, it's a funny story
actually.

00:33.801 --> 00:36.835
Some hunter buried
his dog over there.

00:36.837 --> 00:39.571
Had the rocks in a nice
little heart formation,

00:39.573 --> 00:41.306
wood crosses and everything.

00:41.308 --> 00:44.443
It was pretty fucking gay,
so I messed it up
and took 'em over here.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.311
That's a real
funny story.

00:46.313 --> 00:49.181

all right?

trying to get some
of this firewood.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you steal the grill
from that house like he did? No.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.826

as long as he wants.

from last time.

not mention it?

pretty unavailable.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.829

since his wife disappeared.

Good luck pulling anything
out of that guy.

Oh, I can pull it out.
He lives up here all by himself?
That's kind of hot.

11:10.570 --> 11:13.138
Yeah. He lived here
before my dad bought the place.

11:13.140 --> 11:16.808
Apparently they have some
kind of deal where he can stay
as long as he takes care of it.

Hey, look.
Don't look right now,

12:54.141 --> 12:57.876
but does Ben always stare
at you when you're by the pool?

12:57.878 --> 12:59.677
- Huh?
- I said don't look.

12:59.679 --> 13:02.480
Now it's gonna get even
more uncomfortable with him.

Go fish.
Guys, why don't we
get out of the house?

13:12.359 --> 13:14.859
It's gorgeous. Let's make,
like, a bonfire or something.

13:14.861 --> 13:18.163
What, out there?
In the dark? No.
No, no way.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.965
Dude, stop being
such a freakin' pussy, man.

There's plenty of light
with a campfire.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.676
Sure. Then I'll go
wake up Nina.

Hey, I know a place too
we could all go to.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:34.748 --> 13:36.481
Oh, shut up.
I said we, not us.

13:36.483 --> 13:40.585
Any by us it means not you,
so it's time for you to go.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.620
This is
grown-up business.
Get out of here.

13:42.622 --> 13:46.825
You can come over tomorrow.
It's okay. I got somewhere else
to be anyway, so--

13:46.827 --> 13:48.426
Yeah.
See you guys later.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.962
- Bye, Timmy.
- [ Marcus ] No, we will
not see you anywhere.

But there's snakes out here.

Oh, my God, is that
a dead body?

No, babe, they hide at night.

a minute. Right, baby?

so look for the smoke.

throwing stuff at me?

to our fun weekend together?

just being here with you guys...

you want to be doing this
and not stay with them?

'Cause this lock
ain't budging.

Well, if you
don't want this,

and play with the boys.

Do you think they're
gonna find us out here?

16:34.828 --> 16:36.127
I hope not.
Want a 'mallow?

16:36.129 --> 16:39.764
No. I don't really get
the whole campfire s'more--

16:39.766 --> 16:42.800
If they do find us,
you guys gotta be a lot nicer
to Nina, all right?

We're not--
We're nice to Nina.

to a new girlfriend
every two weeks.

So we try not to get
too invested, right?

don't like her.

Every second.

I will keep it.

Can we make it
a quickie?

It's just coyotes.
There's coyotes?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.834
Maybe it's, like, they're
in heat or something.
They don't eat people.

a story once
where this coyote--

this way, buddy.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.602
What happened
to your flashlight?

18:24.604 --> 18:27.472
I don't have a flashlight, man.
That's why I told you to wait.

18:27.474 --> 18:30.108
Shit. I just saw
your light back there.
You gave one to Eduardo.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.876
Come on, you guys.
You didn't give one to me.

of shit in there, man.

for years.

your future property better,

homage to dead people in there.

in the morning, all right?

and warm in the ranch house,

gonna check it out now.

stay here with the girls.

Don't touch anything in case
we need to call the cops.

a mental picture.

is not gonna be a problem
for me.

You know what?
In fact, I'm gonna take
a real picture.

19:55.762 --> 19:58.062
Who puts a shrine like this
in the middle of nowhere?

19:58.064 --> 19:59.964

what else is in here.

'Cause anything related
to this trailer, I am cool.

you can call the cops and have
them look at the place tomorrow.

All right, look. Let's go.
We'll come back in the morning.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.860

freaking crazy, man.

those images in my mind.

We just need to speak
to Ben, okay?

'Cause he's gonna know what's
going on with the trailer.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.674
Yeah, or we could just leave
and call the cops.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.710
Look, guys, guys.
We came here to relax,
have a good time.

20:45.712 --> 20:48.346
We checked out the trailer.
We didn't see any jars.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.865
Ben should know what's going on
with his property,

20:50.866 --> 20:53.383
but if we call the cops,
it's a big ordeal, and nobody
wants to deal with that.

Yeah, but, bro,
that Ben guy, he's
a freaking character, man.

You see him with the rabbit
the first day,
all dressed up in fatigues?

21:00.860 --> 21:04.061
Normally my dad's here, too,
so he's not the only man
around, you know.

Okay, let's just say
what you guys saw was real.

21:13.973 --> 21:17.742
How did it disappear so fast?
That means somebody had to be
in there with you.

21:17.744 --> 21:20.611
Stop. Look, we're speculating
right now when two people
who were high said that they--

21:20.613 --> 21:22.213
Whoa, whoa, come on,

- Rendezvous.

You thought it was a jar.

Seriously,
are you kidding me?
You're overanalyzing shit.

- I'm just trying to--
- You always will be, man.

finish our breakfast and
get ready for a good day.

go talk to Ben.

we had a campfire,

went into your old trailer.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.589
When was the last time
you checked that place out?

22:38.591 --> 22:41.826
You know, my dad pays you
to know any and everything
that goes on here.

22:41.828 --> 22:44.095
First of all,
your father doesn't pay me.

22:44.097 --> 22:46.664
So why don't you guys
start by telling me
what the problem is,

22:46.666 --> 22:49.100
'cause the last time I checked,
that trailer was locked.

22:49.102 --> 22:52.703

having trouble with squatters

23:51.998 --> 23:55.933
There was a picture
of a guy that looked
a lot like you in it.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.269
They also said they saw
a jar of human remains.

23:58.271 --> 24:02.072
Okay, look, if those two
lovebirds decided to force
their way into that trailer,

24:02.074 --> 24:05.276
it's called
breaking and entering, and
I don't exactly appreciate it.

24:05.278 --> 24:09.747
More importantly,
I don't think they're capable
of pointing fingers.

24:09.749 --> 24:13.083
- What's this about a jar?
- No, look. When we went in,
there were no jars.

24:13.085 --> 24:16.620
There was no pictures
or shrine. There was just
a couple of burnt candles.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.222
Plus we left everything
exactly how we found it.

24:18.224 --> 24:21.492
So if you want to call
the cops or something
like that--

24:21.494 --> 24:23.427
Plus our friend Marcus,
he took a photo.

24:23.429 --> 24:27.164
Just stand down on the photo.
Let me take a look at the
trailer and see what I can find.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.467
If anything's weird, I'll go
to Sheriff Roman in town.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.035
I'll see what he
wants to do about it.

24:31.037 --> 24:33.370
In the meantime,
did any of your friends
get hurt?

24:33.372 --> 24:36.540
No. No, nobody's hurt.

24:36.542 --> 24:39.009
I think just more scared
of what they saw.

seem pretty convinced.

Don't worry about it,
Allie, okay?

24:45.017 --> 24:47.785
I'll go take a look at it.
I'll let you know what I find.

24:47.787 --> 24:50.154

- How'd it go?

24:59.565 --> 25:00.731
So, what happened?

25:00.733 --> 25:03.868
We went and spoke
to Ben.
Yeah.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.903
And he seemed to think
that there was a problem.

25:05.905 --> 25:08.272
He said he would go
to the sheriff
with any findings.

25:08.274 --> 25:09.874
- Perfect.
- Is that it?

25:09.876 --> 25:11.876
Well, he's pretty pissed
that you guys went in there,

25:11.878 --> 25:13.744
even used the words
"breaking and entering."

25:13.746 --> 25:18.082
We went in
just for 10 minutes.
I know what I saw.

25:18.084 --> 25:20.918
We told you guys
not to go in there anyway.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.521
Look, even if you did see
what you saw,

25:23.523 --> 25:26.690
we heard the scream
and we were there in, like,
two or three minutes tops.

25:26.692 --> 25:29.627
- It's just not possible.
- Guys, guys, guys, listen.

25:29.629 --> 25:33.030
If you all would have just
listened to me, we wouldn't have
been here in the first place.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.032
We could be in Lake Havasu
having a great time.

- Doing what kids do
on spring break.

Okay. All right. Yeah.
Something weird did happen
yesterday, all right?

I caught up to you guys,
and then you said something
about a flashlight.

25:45.311 --> 25:47.578
Because I thought you were
behind me with the flashlight.

25:47.580 --> 25:48.979
But you didn't give me
a flashlight.

25:48.981 --> 25:51.649
Okay, we're speculating.
Look, we're not detectives.

what we're talking about.

go have some fun?

Do you ladies want
to gather around, please.

All right.
The quads have been fueled.
The tire pressure's good.

26:32.458 --> 26:34.825
And they are
mechanically sound.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.660
So the only thing you guys

getting lost out there...

stumbling upon something
that might terrify them.

Now this time of year
there are wild animals
roaming the property.

Do not bother them,
and they will not bother you.

26:51.577 --> 26:55.980
The most important thing
to remember is to stay together.
Is that clear?

You know, my uncle
was a jarhead.

Get it? Jar head.
'Cause that's what
they call marines,

27:56.308 --> 27:59.777
and, you know,
in your trailer there was a jar,
and it looked like there was--

27:59.779 --> 28:03.547
Not funny.
Was he enlisted

do you have a permit
for these operations?

want to join your friends?

I don't know how
to break this to you, kid,

but you've always been
somewhat of a pest,

that your timing sucks.

have come up here.

He's killed a lot of people
on this property,
and he's been blackmailing me.

01:13:16.326 --> 01:13:20.962

continue paying him,
he would kill my whole family.

- Why don't you ask him
how your mother really died?
- Shut up.

been paying me off with the
insurance money that she left.

Please, sweetheart,
come to me.

for this place?

and a lot of debt, I--

gonna do, Tom?
