WEBVTT

00:00.238 --> 00:03.953
- Okay, so last time y'all saw Star...
- You're not happy to see me?

00:05.437 --> 00:06.876
I didn't kill Otis.

00:06.878 --> 00:08.878
Well, if Simone didn't kill him,

00:08.880 --> 00:10.313
then who did?

00:10.315 --> 00:13.749
Can you
switch for me? Yeah.

00:13.751 --> 00:15.472
Why does everything have
to be a fight with her?

00:15.474 --> 00:16.719
'Cause that's all she's ever known.

00:16.721 --> 00:18.521
Well, if we're
ever gonna make it as a group,

00:18.523 --> 00:19.989
she needs to get it together.

00:19.991 --> 00:21.123
My dad is in jail.

00:21.148 --> 00:23.048
Must be why you're so
tight with your mom.

00:24.462 --> 00:25.962
You sure you want to
give me your credit card?

00:25.964 --> 00:27.930
I see $20,000 spent

00:27.932 --> 00:29.999
in a high-end fashion boutique.

00:30.001 --> 00:32.067
This is Detective Belkin from
the Atlanta Police Department.

00:32.070 --> 00:33.636
When's the last time
you saw your husband?

00:33.638 --> 00:35.504
Jahil's up to something.

00:35.506 --> 00:36.739
It's only a matter of time.

00:39.811 --> 00:43.012
Lord, I know you got this...

00:43.014 --> 00:44.747
that you oversee all of this,

00:44.749 --> 00:47.650
but please keep an extra
lookout for this girl.

00:47.652 --> 00:49.986
She's naive and ain't got a clue

00:49.988 --> 00:52.088
about this thing called fame.

00:52.090 --> 00:54.056
Maybe if you pull your
eyes away from yourself,

00:54.058 --> 00:55.758
we can get to work.

00:55.760 --> 00:58.027
I know the work and the song.

00:58.029 --> 01:00.129
The children's hospital
event is tomorrow.

01:00.131 --> 01:01.897
We need to be working.

01:01.899 --> 01:04.066
This is work.

01:04.068 --> 01:06.335
Oh, I'm sorry, I
thought we were singers.

01:06.337 --> 01:08.971
It says right here,
"Word on the street is

01:08.973 --> 01:10.640
that Morgan's new love interest,

01:10.642 --> 01:12.441
Ms. Star Davis..." that's my name...

01:12.443 --> 01:15.344
"is the leader of a new
up-and-coming girl group

01:15.346 --> 01:16.412
out of Atlanta."

01:16.414 --> 01:17.980
There is no leader.

01:17.982 --> 01:19.348
It's publicity, Alex.

01:19.350 --> 01:21.183
- That's all.
- Not the right kind.

01:21.185 --> 01:24.086
Do you want to be known as some
football player's piece of ass?

01:24.088 --> 01:27.390
Our likes are sky-high, and
we're trending off the charts.

01:27.392 --> 01:31.060
No. You. You're trending. Not our music.

01:34.732 --> 01:36.866
Jahil is late again.

01:36.868 --> 01:39.735
Do you think it has something
to do with this whole Otis thing?

01:39.737 --> 01:42.571
I think Jahil has a hangover.

01:42.573 --> 01:45.041
I think that's what's wrong with Jahil.

01:53.084 --> 01:54.650
Down.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.494 --> 02:06.062
Yeah.

02:12.136 --> 02:14.036
You lucky son of a bitch.

02:19.110 --> 02:22.411
Wait ten minutes. Then go.

03:15.555 --> 03:17.588
I paid off your debt

03:17.613 --> 03:19.880
to Maggie and the traffickers.

03:21.773 --> 03:23.539
You've been keeping your word to Ed.

03:23.541 --> 03:25.574
You've been good to Hunter.

03:25.576 --> 03:27.109
I owe you.

03:27.111 --> 03:29.111
Yeah, you do, big time.

03:29.113 --> 03:32.815
The minute I made that phone call

03:32.817 --> 03:35.751
and stopped that bullet from
blasting your brains out,

03:35.753 --> 03:39.155
that is when I became
majority shareholder

03:39.157 --> 03:41.023
of your little musical enterprise.

03:41.025 --> 03:43.526
From now on, the split is 80-20, 80-20

03:43.528 --> 03:45.428
- in my favor.
- There is no way

03:45.430 --> 03:46.595
I'm giving up my group.

03:46.597 --> 03:48.631
Nonnegotiable.

03:50.201 --> 03:52.301
Star.

03:53.404 --> 03:55.037
I want her out.

03:55.039 --> 03:56.639
Look, she is a loose cannon,

03:56.641 --> 03:58.546
- I know that, but she is...
- Trash.

03:58.571 --> 04:01.243
- No, she's the face of the group.
- Mm-mm, not the group that I own.

04:01.245 --> 04:02.945
Listen, Arlene, there
is no group without Star.

04:02.947 --> 04:04.680
You can't have a group without
Star at the head of the group.

04:04.682 --> 04:06.715
You know, the only thing
that I should be hearing

04:06.717 --> 04:09.652
from your mouth right now is,
"Thank you. Thank you, Arlene."

04:09.654 --> 04:10.786
Yeah.

04:10.788 --> 04:13.789
All right, well, look, they-they...

04:13.791 --> 04:15.925
they got a performance tomorrow night.

04:15.927 --> 04:17.593
Good. Make it be her last.

04:17.595 --> 04:21.230
No, no, no, make her
want it to be her last.

04:25.203 --> 04:28.270
Keep that bitch away from my son.

Let's try it again, this
time with Alex on lead.

06:07.471 --> 06:09.371
- Vocal and dance.
- What?

06:09.373 --> 06:10.573
Can you do it?

06:10.575 --> 06:11.941
I mean, yeah, I wrote it, so...

06:11.943 --> 06:14.109
All right, let's do it
again, then. Alex up front.

06:14.111 --> 06:15.844
This is a joke, right? You're joking?

06:15.846 --> 06:17.246
You know what the joke is?

06:17.248 --> 06:18.370
You and your antics

06:18.395 --> 06:20.015
putting our Atlanta
NextFest slot in jeopardy.

06:20.017 --> 06:22.351
- That's what the joke is.
- You're serious?

06:22.353 --> 06:24.553
You don't think they
monitor all that TMZ garbage?

06:24.555 --> 06:26.255
Trust me, they do,
and this one right here

06:26.257 --> 06:27.756
with her sleazy behavior...

06:27.758 --> 06:29.325
you think that's what
they want to promote?

06:29.327 --> 06:31.727
It ain't. The image, the
perception they're trying

06:31.729 --> 06:33.462
to put out there is
that their contestants

06:33.464 --> 06:35.798
are decent, caring
human beings, all right?

06:35.800 --> 06:37.967
That's why we're doing
this charity event.

06:37.969 --> 06:39.635
They're not looking for
some fame-hungry monster

06:39.637 --> 06:41.136
who's banging the local quarterback.

06:42.373 --> 06:43.939
And that's why you're doing this,

06:43.941 --> 06:45.074
'cause of Hunter.

06:45.076 --> 06:46.942
Did you hear what I said?!

06:46.944 --> 06:48.911
But I'm right, though.

Because I came out of you shining.

07:38.963 --> 07:42.398
That's right.

07:42.400 --> 07:45.267
I want to be like you, Mama.

07:47.872 --> 07:50.406
No, you don't.

07:50.408 --> 07:53.842
Listen... you have to promise me

07:53.844 --> 07:56.445
that you're gonna be
better than me, okay?

07:56.447 --> 07:57.913
Promise me.

07:57.915 --> 08:00.649

08:32.753 --> 08:34.852
I went by the studio to look for you.

08:34.855 --> 08:36.355
The girls said you took off.

08:36.357 --> 08:37.556
They're worried about you.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.157
Good. Tell them I died.

08:39.159 --> 08:40.926
I came here to apologize.

08:40.928 --> 08:42.260
Your mother know that?

08:47.234 --> 08:49.101
Get in the damn car.

09:01.882 --> 09:03.382
How am I supposed to open it?

09:07.855 --> 09:10.355
Damn, who made the door like this?

09:12.693 --> 09:15.293
It has nothing to do with the money.

09:16.263 --> 09:17.596
I was shocked, okay?

09:17.598 --> 09:19.197
And, yeah, a little hurt.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.771
I'm into you, Star.

09:25.773 --> 09:30.242
Right... which is why you let
your mother talk to me like that

09:30.244 --> 09:31.910
without even letting me explain myself?

09:31.912 --> 09:35.447
Okay, with my ma it's a
little complicated, all right?

09:35.692 --> 09:39.227
Oh. What was that?

09:39.229 --> 09:40.795
What-What are you doing?

09:40.797 --> 09:42.196
Sorry, I thought I just heard

09:42.198 --> 09:44.198
your big balls roll onto the floor.

09:44.200 --> 09:47.168
I was looking for them.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.971
It's the finances, okay?

09:49.973 --> 09:52.106
I ain't good with that kind of stuff

09:52.108 --> 09:55.510
and I come from nothing,
just like you, Star.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.613
And my ma, she handles all the money.

09:58.615 --> 10:00.682
And yeah, you're right.

10:00.684 --> 10:03.418
I should have heard you out.

10:04.149 --> 10:05.720
We got two very different

10:05.722 --> 10:08.956
versions of nothing. Okay?

10:08.958 --> 10:12.560
I had to scratch and claw
for everything I ever got.

10:12.562 --> 10:15.129
So, when somebody
hands me a credit card,

10:15.131 --> 10:17.932
that street bitch just comes out.

10:17.934 --> 10:20.835
I wasn't thinking about you.

10:21.771 --> 10:23.438
I wasn't thinking about...

10:23.440 --> 10:25.373
anything.

10:25.375 --> 10:29.010
I want you to be my street bitch.

10:29.012 --> 10:32.013
Don't ever say that again.

10:32.015 --> 10:34.615
Please don't ever say that again, okay?

10:41.091 --> 10:44.559
See you at rehearsal.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.694
Yo.

10:46.696 --> 10:48.563
Go easy on Star.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.765
Soon as she goes easy on us.

10:55.739 --> 10:58.039
Why'd you take away that lead from Star?

10:58.041 --> 10:59.440
You're better for it.

10:59.442 --> 11:01.976
Not last week.

11:01.978 --> 11:04.245
Then it was all about having
the white girl front and center.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.814
- Not true.
- Oh, please.

11:06.816 --> 11:08.700
What the hell is going on, Jahil?

11:08.725 --> 11:10.451
Look, you want to live in Star's shadow,

11:10.453 --> 11:11.586
or do you want the world to really know

11:11.588 --> 11:12.920
who Alexandra Crane is?

11:12.922 --> 11:14.789
Huh?

11:14.791 --> 11:17.725
It is all about you, baby.

11:17.727 --> 11:20.828
I've been watching you, and I was wrong.

11:20.830 --> 11:23.030
It's you.

11:23.032 --> 11:26.567
Forget about them low-rent bitches.

11:28.238 --> 11:31.839
She's a really good person deep down.

11:31.841 --> 11:33.808
But her ego is...

11:33.810 --> 11:35.910
Yeah.

11:35.912 --> 11:38.646
When I was her age, ego was my religion.

11:38.648 --> 11:42.049
We got that in common for sure.

11:42.051 --> 11:44.952
You know, maybe we could, I don't know,

11:44.954 --> 11:47.488
try and get her to come to church.

11:47.490 --> 11:50.158
Sorry, Pastor, but Star is
not the church-going type.

11:51.861 --> 11:53.795
I wasn't, either.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.930
But I don't know, we might be able

11:55.932 --> 11:58.800
to work our magic from both sides,

11:58.802 --> 12:00.535
and bully her into
coming in or something.

12:00.537 --> 12:01.803
What do you think?

12:01.805 --> 12:02.904
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

12:03.973 --> 12:05.773
Let's do it.

12:05.775 --> 12:07.275
Yeah, Uncle Cross will love that.

12:07.277 --> 12:09.143
Just bring me some.

12:09.145 --> 12:12.246
All right. I'll see you then.

12:12.248 --> 12:14.382
All right.

12:14.384 --> 12:15.550
Who was that?

12:15.552 --> 12:18.419
My cousin Mecca.

12:18.421 --> 12:19.787
My Uncle Cross' birthday's tomorrow.

12:19.789 --> 12:21.656
We're doing, like, a
barbecue thing for him

12:21.658 --> 12:23.991
with the family...

12:23.993 --> 12:25.726
that I can't wait to show you off to.

12:25.728 --> 12:28.896
Don't make me nervous.

12:28.898 --> 12:31.833
I'm not everyone's style.

12:31.835 --> 12:35.102
They're gonna love you,
babe, you know that.

12:37.073 --> 12:40.141
What is this? What's going on here?

12:40.143 --> 12:42.777
This song,
for the Music Loves event.

12:42.779 --> 12:44.879
Jahil wants me to sing lead on it.

12:44.881 --> 12:45.980
Blondie's mad.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.982
Good.

12:47.984 --> 12:51.352
Tell here to scratch
her ass and get glad.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.254
She need to be knocked down a notch.

12:53.256 --> 12:54.856
Yeah, she does.

12:54.858 --> 12:59.060
But I don't know. Something's not right.

12:59.062 --> 13:02.430
I mean, what's right is putting
your beautiful face up front.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.933
That's what's up.

13:07.437 --> 13:09.094
- Can I hear it?
- Yeah.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.824
Rashid just got shot.

13:31.327 --> 13:32.727
What?

13:32.729 --> 13:34.262
Damn, who told you that?

13:34.264 --> 13:36.764
That was his mama Regina on the phone.

13:36.766 --> 13:39.233
The boy was just picking
up some groceries for her.

13:42.372 --> 13:44.272
Was it the police?

13:44.274 --> 13:46.207
I don't even know. She was a wreck.

13:46.209 --> 13:47.842
I couldn't even understand
nothing she was saying.

13:47.844 --> 13:49.043
But who else could it be?

13:49.045 --> 13:50.611
Who else... who else could it be?

13:50.613 --> 13:52.280
He... he was in a gang, too.

13:52.282 --> 13:54.782
Don't go there yet, Cotton.
All police ain't bad.

13:56.850 --> 13:58.319
I done had quite a few.

13:58.321 --> 14:00.454
Some of the best
sessions I done ever had.

14:00.456 --> 14:02.723
Bitch, you gonna burn in hell.

14:02.725 --> 14:04.525
Girl, that's what they say.

14:07.163 --> 14:08.362
Pastor here.

14:08.364 --> 14:11.365
I'm gonna send him right to Regina's.

14:11.367 --> 14:13.935
Cotton, why don't you
run up to my bedroom

14:13.937 --> 14:15.336
and get that old curling iron?

14:15.338 --> 14:18.506
Really? Say it.

14:18.508 --> 14:20.741
Just say it.

14:20.743 --> 14:23.277
You don't want me here when
your holy crush walks in.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.946
Just get the damn iron.

14:27.058 --> 14:28.816
I think it'd be good for you.

14:28.818 --> 14:30.418
But I'm clean now.

14:30.420 --> 14:33.554
They'll help you stay that way.

14:33.556 --> 14:35.156
Hey.

14:35.158 --> 14:37.291
I was just telling Simone

14:37.293 --> 14:39.427
about my friend's
recovery group, you know?

14:39.429 --> 14:42.563
That'd be real good.

14:42.565 --> 14:46.434
I invited Pastor over for Sunday dinner.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.604
That's if it's okay with you.

14:57.146 --> 15:00.448
Um, so I'll just see you on Sunday.

15:00.450 --> 15:03.250
Hey, Bobby, would you mind just going

15:03.252 --> 15:04.919
and checking on Sister Regina?

15:04.921 --> 15:06.387
Her son got shot.

15:07.690 --> 15:09.423
My God.

15:09.425 --> 15:11.492
Okay, I will.

15:11.494 --> 15:13.127
See you, babe.

15:13.129 --> 15:16.130
All right, I'll text
you her address. Yeah.

15:24.507 --> 15:25.806
♪ From where you go... ♪

15:25.808 --> 15:27.475
Look, I'm not a miracle worker.

I need more time.

15:28.878 --> 15:31.012

15:38.588 --> 15:41.622
Great, and take a five.

15:47.563 --> 15:49.497
You hear that?

15:49.499 --> 15:51.899
Yeah. Alex sounds good.

15:51.901 --> 15:54.168
Yeah, she is good,
just not as good as me.

15:54.170 --> 15:57.338
I know you're unhappy,
really, and I'm sorry.

15:57.340 --> 15:58.839
No, I don't care if you're sorry,

15:58.841 --> 16:00.360
just put it back the way
that it's supposed to be.

16:00.384 --> 16:01.676
No, it's the right thing to do

16:01.678 --> 16:03.144
for now, trust me.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.546
Why you gotta make
this so damn difficult?

16:05.548 --> 16:06.614
Because you won't tell me

16:06.616 --> 16:09.216
the real reason you
just made that switch.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.152
You want your place back up front,

16:11.154 --> 16:13.688
- stay the hell away from Hunter.
- Why?

16:13.690 --> 16:15.356
'Cause he told me that
you snort more coke

16:15.358 --> 16:17.658
than Tony Montana?

16:20.863 --> 16:24.198
Or because you're just plain jealous?

16:24.200 --> 16:27.268
You know, Star, whether you
want to believe this or not,

16:27.270 --> 16:30.137
all I care about is
what's right for you.

16:30.139 --> 16:31.639
Now, I love Hunter like a nephew,

16:31.641 --> 16:34.408
but he is bad news... Trust me on this.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.210
Don't get caught up with him.

16:36.212 --> 16:39.513
You're pissed off because
Hunter's everything you're not,

16:39.515 --> 16:41.615
and he has me.

16:41.617 --> 16:43.918
You ungrateful little bitch.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.421
Give up the blow, and
maybe I'll give up Hunter.

17:03.685 --> 17:06.219
Baked chicken and sweet potato pie?

17:06.221 --> 17:08.355
Since when you became Paula Deen?

17:08.357 --> 17:11.558
My pastor is coming by
for dinner after church.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.728
You sure you want me to be here?

17:14.730 --> 17:16.429
Stop that.

17:16.431 --> 17:18.431
Come on, Mama.

17:18.433 --> 17:21.201
- Now, we both know what's up.
- Really?

17:21.203 --> 17:22.969
What is up, Cotton?

17:22.971 --> 17:24.671
You chose to be who you are.

17:24.673 --> 17:27.207
Don't put your issues on me.

17:27.209 --> 17:30.343
And I ain't having dinner without you.

17:30.345 --> 17:32.912
So I'm supposed to say thank you now?

17:36.251 --> 17:39.419
Don't even worry about it, Mama.

17:39.421 --> 17:41.688
'Cause your precious
pastor ain't gonna know.

17:41.690 --> 17:43.356
Not unless you tell him.

17:43.358 --> 17:45.859
And why would you do that?

17:56.405 --> 17:58.872
I don't know.

17:58.874 --> 18:01.174
Then don't ask for my help, then.

18:01.176 --> 18:03.009
You look cute.

18:03.011 --> 18:05.245
Girl, you look normal.

18:05.247 --> 18:07.614
Okay, for God's sakes,
this is a barbecue.

18:07.616 --> 18:09.115
Just don't use your big-ass words,

18:09.117 --> 18:11.418
and slouch a little
bit... Slouch, slouch.

18:11.420 --> 18:13.153
That's already better.

18:13.155 --> 18:14.988
- Yeah, there you go, yeah.
- I don't slouch.

18:14.990 --> 18:17.023
Look what I got for the charity event.

18:17.025 --> 18:18.658
You think it's cute?

18:18.660 --> 18:20.460
Is that what you're wearing?

18:20.462 --> 18:23.063
I'm going to Derek's
uncle's barbecue first.

18:23.065 --> 18:24.864
How come I'm not invited?

18:24.866 --> 18:26.733
Like you'd want to go.

18:28.670 --> 18:32.172
Hunter said he wanted me
to be his "street bitch."

18:35.277 --> 18:37.510
Wow, he's a kinky one, isn't he?

18:37.512 --> 18:38.478
And Star isn't?

18:38.480 --> 18:40.080
I don't know, you guys.

18:40.082 --> 18:42.182
You think his family will respond to me?

18:42.184 --> 18:43.550
Respond to you?

18:43.552 --> 18:44.951
- Yeah.
- No.

18:44.953 --> 18:47.609
Not if you talk like that.

18:47.634 --> 18:49.255
Just go in there and act regular.

18:49.257 --> 18:50.623
Don't stare at any of his cousins

18:50.625 --> 18:51.658
who have missing teeth,

18:51.660 --> 18:52.959
and don't squint or act surprised

18:52.961 --> 18:54.461
by his aunties with bad weaves.

18:54.463 --> 18:55.662
You gotta respect the fact

18:55.664 --> 18:57.097
she didn't grow up the way that we did.

18:57.099 --> 18:58.765
What I respect is us having

18:58.767 --> 19:00.166
our priorities straight.

19:00.168 --> 19:02.335
Like you getting the lead spot back?

19:02.337 --> 19:05.572
Oh, no, that's your spot today, Alex.

19:05.574 --> 19:08.675
Everybody who's anybody in
Atlanta's gonna be there.

19:08.677 --> 19:10.343
Kill it.

19:10.345 --> 19:11.778
Don't fall on your face
'cause you're letting me

19:11.780 --> 19:13.780
rent space in your head.

19:15.687 --> 19:17.951
Star, why you gotta
go say stuff like that?

19:17.953 --> 19:19.119
Grow up, Simone.

19:19.121 --> 19:21.121
No, you grow up! Stop hurting people.

19:21.123 --> 19:22.188
Alex didn't ask for that lead part.

19:22.190 --> 19:23.523
Then she should have said no.

19:23.525 --> 19:24.924
Why can't you put your ego on the shelf

19:24.926 --> 19:25.992
for a second and be supportive

19:25.994 --> 19:27.260
of someone else for a change?

19:28.797 --> 19:30.964
You didn't act like
this when we were kids.

20:04.406 --> 20:06.232
- Nephew.
- Unc!

20:08.602 --> 20:10.503
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

20:10.505 --> 20:11.838
- How are you?
- Thank you. Good, good, good.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.173
I would like to introduce you to Alex.

20:13.175 --> 20:15.308
- Alex, this is my Uncle Cross.
- Hi.

20:15.310 --> 20:17.710
So you're still with this
Black Lives Matter thing, huh?

20:17.712 --> 20:20.146
- Yes, sir.
- Be careful, man.

20:20.148 --> 20:21.948
Come on, our country's
been one step forward,

20:21.950 --> 20:23.650
two steps back.

20:23.652 --> 20:25.785
I'm just trying to make it so
we stay moving forward, you know?

20:25.787 --> 20:28.955
But it's a new sheriff in
town, nephew, be careful.

20:28.957 --> 20:31.124
What he's doing is important.

20:31.126 --> 20:33.660
What'd you say you did again?

20:33.662 --> 20:36.396
I'm a singer.

20:36.398 --> 20:38.465
You shouldn't have told him that.

20:38.467 --> 20:41.801
- Uncle Cross likes to sing.
- Ah. Singer.

20:41.803 --> 20:43.670
Okay.

20:43.672 --> 20:46.339
I'm gonna find the right song for us.

20:46.341 --> 20:49.609
Then, me and you, it's on.

20:49.611 --> 20:53.079
O-Okay, sure.

20:53.081 --> 20:54.347
- What the hell?
- "It's on!"

20:54.349 --> 20:56.015
- You heard what he said.
- That's not funny.

20:56.017 --> 20:57.350
Look, he rap.

20:57.352 --> 20:58.852
Y'all gonna have fun, I promise.

20:58.854 --> 21:00.286
- Okay.
- It's cool, all right.

21:00.288 --> 21:01.354
Now, can we go check on my grandma?

21:01.356 --> 21:02.355
I'm sure she's about

21:02.357 --> 21:03.957
- half drunk right now.
- Okay.

21:58.853 --> 22:02.588
I'm thinking about this
recovery group, but...

22:02.590 --> 22:04.924
I don't know.

22:04.926 --> 22:07.693
Baby steps.

22:07.695 --> 22:11.130
Check it out and then
you take it from there.

22:11.132 --> 22:13.032
Pastor, do you drink?

22:13.034 --> 22:15.067
Nope, I'm allergic.

22:16.270 --> 22:17.836
You're allergic?

22:17.838 --> 22:19.738
Yeah, I...

22:19.740 --> 22:22.074
I break out in handcuffs.

22:26.992 --> 22:29.782
I mean, I'm 16, and I can't even imagine

22:29.784 --> 22:31.617
not having a drink ever again.

22:31.619 --> 22:33.352
That's crazy.

22:33.354 --> 22:35.087
Never should've started
in the first place.

22:41.529 --> 22:44.897
But... day by day.

22:44.899 --> 22:47.032
Yes, 'cause that's
what the big book says.

22:48.463 --> 22:52.605
See, when I was your age, I
used to have a thing for mollies.

22:52.607 --> 22:54.306
But I dealt with that all on my own.

22:58.980 --> 23:03.682
I didn't know you had such
a lovely daughter, Carlotta.

23:03.684 --> 23:05.718
It's nice to meet you.

23:05.720 --> 23:08.520
You wouldn't think she
had a daughter at all.

23:16.731 --> 23:19.632
Well, I got to go get
ready for this event.

23:20.935 --> 23:22.768
Well, don't come back in here drunk.

23:22.770 --> 23:24.069
I mean it.

23:24.071 --> 23:27.773
One day at a time.

23:29.877 --> 23:31.410
Thanks for everything.

23:41.856 --> 23:43.355
Grandma Ruby,

23:43.357 --> 23:44.757
Look who I brought.

23:44.759 --> 23:46.125
Alex.

23:46.127 --> 23:48.494
Ain't you a pretty little black thing.

23:48.496 --> 23:50.696
Much better looking than his mama.

23:50.698 --> 23:52.364
God rest her ugly ass.

23:52.366 --> 23:53.866
You met Alex already.

23:53.868 --> 23:56.001
She is cute, ain't she?

23:56.003 --> 23:58.170
I'm Star, I live right next door.

23:58.172 --> 24:00.039
I don't think we've met yet.

24:00.041 --> 24:01.340
What's she doing in here?

24:01.342 --> 24:03.639
Get her out. Get her out of here now!

24:03.664 --> 24:05.655
You know I don't have no
white folks up in here!

24:05.680 --> 24:06.723
They're bad luck!

24:06.747 --> 24:08.547
Grandma, please calm down for a minute.

24:08.549 --> 24:09.882
No, you calm your ass down.

24:09.884 --> 24:12.017
Negro, you trying to
kill me or something?!

24:14.021 --> 24:16.422
That bitch done made
me lose my appetite.

24:19.026 --> 24:20.292
Little girl, what's your name?

24:20.294 --> 24:22.127
Alex.

24:22.129 --> 24:26.699
Help an old lady up to her bedroom,

24:26.701 --> 24:30.502
since her grandson don't give a damn.

24:30.504 --> 24:32.738
Uh, baby,

24:32.740 --> 24:34.306
will you give me my bottle of beer?

24:37.453 --> 24:39.712
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma,
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma.

24:39.714 --> 24:41.447
Grandma.

24:41.449 --> 24:42.881
Please.

24:42.883 --> 24:44.950
I got it, okay, okay.

24:44.952 --> 24:47.019
Just relax a little
bit. Get her some water...

24:47.021 --> 24:48.987
I'm sorry, I apologize for that.

24:48.989 --> 24:50.356
She's drunk.

24:50.358 --> 24:52.024
- No, no, no.
- Don't pay her no mind.

24:52.026 --> 24:53.992
- Please.
- That's okay, you don't have to do that.

24:53.994 --> 24:56.328
You really don't have to
do that, I'm used to it.

24:56.330 --> 24:58.697
And I'm sure a lot of old white folks

24:58.699 --> 25:00.232
feel the same way about y'all.

25:02.269 --> 25:04.236
You ain't as bad as I thought.

25:05.206 --> 25:07.339
Really?

25:07.341 --> 25:09.708
What exactly does
Alexandra say about me?

25:09.710 --> 25:12.111
Look, we're
not gonna go into detail,

25:12.113 --> 25:13.345
but it's all good, okay?

25:13.347 --> 25:15.714
I can't even imagine.

25:15.716 --> 25:17.583
Why are you here?

25:19.720 --> 25:22.621
Look, if Jahil wants
you to sing lead today,

25:22.623 --> 25:24.156
I'm cool with it.

25:24.158 --> 25:25.391
Oh, really?

25:25.393 --> 25:26.990
Yes.

25:27.015 --> 25:29.695
Whatever is best for the group, right?

25:32.133 --> 25:33.399
Hey, I've got the song, y'all.

25:33.401 --> 25:34.833
Y'all go over there, over there.

25:34.835 --> 25:37.369
This is our stage. Let's go.

25:37.371 --> 25:40.706
You. You said you could sing, right?

25:40.708 --> 25:42.107
Well, we're gonna see what you got.

25:42.109 --> 25:43.542
No.

25:43.544 --> 25:45.711
- Come on, now. Come on.
- Yeah, show time.

25:45.713 --> 25:48.080
- Come on.
- Thought you was rich.

25:48.082 --> 25:50.147

You're blessed to have a

27:52.172 --> 27:54.773
Her walk with God is inspiring.

27:54.775 --> 27:57.168
And she knows both sides,

27:57.193 --> 27:59.378
the street and the spirit.

27:59.380 --> 28:02.614
Yes, she does know both sides.

28:06.120 --> 28:09.121
When you gonna come to
church? When you gonna join us?

28:14.061 --> 28:16.061
Where you going?

28:16.063 --> 28:19.831
Some place with alcohol.

28:24.805 --> 28:27.039
You know what amazes me?

28:27.041 --> 28:29.207
Alex thinks she's all that

28:29.209 --> 28:32.644
because a bunch of drunks at
a barbecue told her she is.

28:32.646 --> 28:35.113
Wait until she has to perform
in front of an entire audience

28:35.115 --> 28:37.549
of people who matter.

28:37.551 --> 28:39.418
That's kind of harsh, babe.

28:39.420 --> 28:40.819
It's not harsh, it's the truth.

28:40.821 --> 28:42.955
She's in for a rude awakening.

28:44.758 --> 28:46.658
What is this?

28:46.660 --> 28:48.794
Where's my dress?

28:48.796 --> 28:50.329
Threw it away.

29:06.680 --> 29:09.281
I'm kidding. Easy.

29:09.283 --> 29:11.650
But I would love to
see you in this tonight.

29:11.652 --> 29:13.719
- That is not what I picked out.
- I know, but...

29:13.721 --> 29:15.454
No, where's my dress?
Did you throw it away?

29:15.456 --> 29:18.690
Relax, no, I did not, okay?

29:18.692 --> 29:20.792
Come on.

29:20.794 --> 29:23.295
Wear this. Please, wear it.

29:23.297 --> 29:24.863
Why?

29:24.865 --> 29:29.101
Because you deserve to
be seen in a $3,000 dress.

29:33.307 --> 29:35.307
Wear it.

29:35.309 --> 29:36.975
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.

30:16.941 --> 30:18.707
Why have a fund-raiser?

30:18.709 --> 30:20.876
They could've just used the
money they spent on this.

30:20.878 --> 30:22.912
It's all a waste.

30:22.914 --> 30:25.003
It's the first rule to being rich.

30:27.585 --> 30:30.553
Damn, girl, you look hot!

30:30.555 --> 30:32.621
No tan mamacita como tu.

30:32.623 --> 30:34.790
She said "Not as hot as you."

30:34.792 --> 30:36.601
So you all set?

30:36.626 --> 30:38.627
Yeah. A little nervous,

30:38.629 --> 30:40.863
but good.

30:40.865 --> 30:42.843
So where is, uh, where's Star?

30:42.868 --> 30:44.901
Bringing up the rear.

30:47.734 --> 30:50.635
You clean up good, Unc.

30:50.637 --> 30:52.870
Why don't, uh...

30:52.872 --> 30:54.739
why don't you guys try to find a place,

30:54.741 --> 30:56.341
and do what you got to do to get ready.

30:56.343 --> 30:57.642
You're gonna go on after the speeches.

30:57.644 --> 30:58.977
Oh. Want to come?

30:58.979 --> 31:00.411
Si.

31:10.357 --> 31:13.591
Hey, Hunter, you mind if
I talk to you a minute?

31:13.593 --> 31:16.194
Yeah, sure.

31:17.731 --> 31:19.197
How you doing?

31:19.199 --> 31:21.265
Good. Just enjoying some
free time before minicamp.

31:21.267 --> 31:22.567
You?

31:22.569 --> 31:25.136
Fine. Listen, I need to ask you a favor.

31:25.138 --> 31:27.438
I don't have any money for you, Jahil.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.040
Stay away from Star.

31:29.042 --> 31:30.408
Excuse me?

31:30.410 --> 31:31.642
Just do what I'm asking, please.

31:31.644 --> 31:32.677
You want her, don't you?

31:32.679 --> 31:35.480
Just... stay away.

31:35.482 --> 31:37.546
All right? It's the right thing.

32:05.478 --> 32:08.379
Cotton is a man.

32:13.520 --> 32:16.387
That's my baby boy.

32:35.442 --> 32:37.542
I named him Arnold.

32:41.281 --> 32:45.683
That's why I ain't never had you over.

33:06.187 --> 33:08.020
They do make a good apple martini.

33:10.343 --> 33:12.410
I like my martinis raw.

33:14.114 --> 33:17.782
I am talking to the most beautiful woman

33:17.784 --> 33:20.485
I have seen in all my 32 years.

33:20.487 --> 33:24.088
Look, baby, I don't do Asian boys.

33:27.293 --> 33:29.227
What if I told you...

33:43.476 --> 33:45.443
I'll buy you another.

33:45.445 --> 33:46.911
Yeah.

33:46.913 --> 33:49.614
Yes, please.

33:52.218 --> 33:54.819
Music Loves works hard
to provide a safety net...

33:54.821 --> 33:57.703
Oh, my God, it's Porsha Williams.

33:57.728 --> 34:00.358
...who might have fallen on hard times.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.994
Whether economic or
because of health issues...

34:02.996 --> 34:04.762
You get through this, I'm
gonna explain everything.

34:04.764 --> 34:07.232
I'm gonna make it up
to you, okay? I promise.

34:07.257 --> 34:10.001
Either way, Music
Loves is there for them.

34:10.003 --> 34:12.937
And now, to help in that effort,

34:12.938 --> 34:14.405
what I hear may be

34:14.407 --> 34:17.241
Atlanta's next big

39:58.463 --> 40:00.940
All right, she don't get it.

40:00.942 --> 40:02.942
It's exactly why I got
to leave this outfit.

40:02.944 --> 40:05.278
You hurt her, Star.

40:06.281 --> 40:08.281
And she will get over that.

40:08.283 --> 40:10.617
But what matters right now
is that thousands of people

40:10.619 --> 40:12.452
are looking at us,

40:12.454 --> 40:14.120
Simone, us.

40:14.122 --> 40:17.023
You keep it up and there won't be an us.

40:17.025 --> 40:19.059
I mean, look at you...

40:19.061 --> 40:21.061
The jealousy, the ego.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.663
You know that's what broke up
Mama and Miss Carlotta, right?

40:23.665 --> 40:25.632
And now look what you're doing.

40:25.634 --> 40:27.000
Simone.

40:27.002 --> 40:28.535
I can't with you.

40:38.980 --> 40:41.281
I got us to number one,

40:41.283 --> 40:44.117
y'all should be thanking me.

40:44.119 --> 40:46.786
It was supposed
to be a routine traffic stop.

40:46.788 --> 40:48.655
One which ended in tragedy

40:48.680 --> 40:49.938
as Danielle Jackson

40:49.963 --> 40:51.658
was shot and killed by police

40:51.660 --> 40:53.393
- after they claim...
- Danielle.

40:53.395 --> 40:54.627
...she reached for a gun
in her glove compartment.

40:54.629 --> 40:55.628
Oh, no.

40:55.630 --> 40:56.663
No gun was found at the scene.

40:56.665 --> 40:57.731
Oh, no.

40:57.733 --> 40:59.999
No, she don't have no gun!

41:00.001 --> 41:01.901
- What?
- They took her.

41:03.338 --> 41:06.139
This is the second incident...

41:06.141 --> 41:08.508
They took her.

41:08.510 --> 41:10.610
...of an unarmed
African American citizen.

41:10.612 --> 41:12.479
- Danielle don't do nothing like that!
- It's all right, babe.

41:14.501 --> 41:16.483
She don't do
nothing like that. No, no, no.

41:16.485 --> 41:17.851
Police and local authorities

41:17.853 --> 41:19.419
urge calm until all the facts are in.

41:19.421 --> 41:20.987
Oh, my God.

41:20.989 --> 41:22.455
It's okay, baby.
