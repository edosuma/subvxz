Should'’ve known it was you.

15:03.424 --> 15:05.078
Murtaugh, why am I not surprised

15:05.121 --> 15:07.428
that the first time I see you
in six months, you'’re in cuffs?

15:07.471 --> 15:09.691
Are these really necessary?Nope.

15:09.734 --> 15:12.128
But considering the damage
you two caused,

15:12.172 --> 15:13.390
better get used to them.

15:13.434 --> 15:14.391
Uh, I'’m not with him.

15:14.435 --> 15:15.740
Uh, we'’re on separate cases.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.960
That'’s true.
I was working the Riggs case.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.266
The perp'’s car

15:19.309 --> 15:21.355
had the same tires
found at Garrett'’s body.

15:21.398 --> 15:22.878
And so...Yeah, I was pursuing

15:22.922 --> 15:25.098
a Chechen
with a big bag of socks.

15:25.141 --> 15:27.491
Chechens

15:27.535 --> 15:29.667
I heard them talking.In Chechen?

15:29.711 --> 15:32.409
Yeah. At first, I thought it was
maybe Georgian or Russian,

15:32.453 --> 15:34.020
and then I heard the guttural...
sound.

15:34.063 --> 15:35.673
Okay, okay.

15:35.717 --> 15:39.590
You know, I'’m just here till
we find a replacement for Avery.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.288
Then all of this

15:41.331 --> 15:43.029
is someone else'’s headache.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.595
Officer Cole,

15:44.639 --> 15:45.857
considering
your background,

15:45.901 --> 15:47.294
we'’ll look into
the Chechen lead.

15:47.337 --> 15:48.773
But as of right now,

15:48.817 --> 15:50.297
you are suspended from duty.

15:50.340 --> 15:51.385
Dismissed.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.169
Uh-uh, Murtaugh.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.605
Not you. You just hang back.

15:54.649 --> 15:55.824
It was really
nice meeting you.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.086
I'’m sorry I thought
you were homeless.

15:58.174 --> 15:59.828

16:00.916 --> 16:02.309
Murtaugh.

16:02.352 --> 16:03.963
When are you gonna
let all this go?

16:04.006 --> 16:07.183
You want me to drop the Riggs
case and come back to the force?

16:07.227 --> 16:08.315
I'’m...
No.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.186
I want you to retire.

16:10.230 --> 16:13.015
You'’ve put in far more
than your 20 years.

16:13.059 --> 16:16.540
It'’s time to just, you know,
sail off into the sunset.

16:16.584 --> 16:19.239
Maybe I'’m not ready to sail off
into a sunset.

16:19.282 --> 16:24.722
Well, after the stunt
you pulled today...

16:24.766 --> 16:26.507
it may not be a request.

16:28.378 --> 16:30.511
Now you'’re dismissed.

16:32.426 --> 16:33.601
Hey.

16:33.644 --> 16:35.733
What did you mean
about his background?

16:35.777 --> 16:38.214
Guy speaks seven languages.

16:38.258 --> 16:39.433
State Department
placed him here,

16:39.476 --> 16:41.348

16:41.391 --> 16:43.089
You do the math.

16:43.132 --> 16:44.177

17:05.676 --> 17:07.548

17:20.082 --> 17:22.563

nice to surprise you.

17:23.520 --> 17:24.478
Surprise.

17:24.521 --> 17:26.523
Yeah

17:26.567 --> 17:28.047
You completely messed me up.

17:28.090 --> 17:29.831
Okay, listen.
I-I'’m gonna fix this.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.485

17:35.271 --> 17:37.708
Oh, you-- I love your glasses.

17:37.752 --> 17:39.188
Thank you.Hey, um,

17:39.232 --> 17:41.843
I was wondering if you could
give Maya a do

17:41.886 --> 17:44.106
You know, the best musicians,
they need time to warm up.

17:44.150 --> 17:48.023
I'’m sorry. There will be
another audition in six months.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.112
Six months.

17:50.156 --> 17:53.681
Excuse me. Do you have
any parking tickets?

17:53.724 --> 17:55.117
:
Because I know a guy.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.075
Cole.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.207
Nat.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.253
To be continued.Hi.

18:00.296 --> 18:01.732
Hi.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.343
What the hell
are you doing here?

18:03.386 --> 18:04.692

18:04.735 --> 18:05.954
Well, you'’re 12 years too late.

18:05.997 --> 18:08.130
Shouldn'’t you be at
work, or something?

18:08.174 --> 18:12.134
Yeah, um, there was
a small car chase,

18:12.178 --> 18:14.223
yadda, yadda,

18:14.267 --> 18:15.746
I got suspended.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.357
From being a meter maid?

18:17.400 --> 18:19.794
Whoa, Nat. Meter person.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.056
It'’s 2018.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.623
It'’s the same old story, Cole.

18:22.666 --> 18:25.800
Wherever you go, chaos follows.

18:25.843 --> 18:28.368
"Chaos" is extreme.

18:28.411 --> 18:31.066
Cole. It'’s not like
when she was six,

18:31.110 --> 18:33.503
and you could just,
you know, swoop into town

18:33.547 --> 18:35.331
and whisk her off to Disneyland.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.680
All right, look, Nat.

18:36.724 --> 18:39.161
The guy that'’s standing
before you is a new man.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.815
You just don'’t know him yet.

18:40.858 --> 18:44.819
Or maybe I know him too well.

18:44.862 --> 18:45.994
Or you just don'’t know him yet.

18:46.037 --> 18:48.388
Know him too well.
Are you okay?

18:48.431 --> 18:50.477
No. Don'’t know him.

18:50.520 --> 18:54.002
One of the biggest problems
plaguing our city is gridlock,

18:54.045 --> 18:56.265
L.A.'’s original sin.
But no longer,

18:56.309 --> 19:00.313
because a vote for Avery
is a very good commute.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.097
Is it too punny?

19:02.141 --> 19:04.491
Be honest.No, no, it'’s very powerful.

19:04.534 --> 19:06.493
Okay, now I know you'’re
not paying attention,

19:06.536 --> 19:09.191
'’cause it's awful. But I have
this press event for the revamp

19:09.235 --> 19:10.975
of the old L.A. Railway,
and they'’ve already made

19:11.019 --> 19:12.760

22:52.980 --> 22:54.373
Garrett Riggs.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.940
I saw the truck outside.
He was here, huh?

22:56.984 --> 23:00.074
Garrett Riggs?
I met him in prison.

23:00.117 --> 23:03.120
He needed a place to stay.
Troubled kid.

23:03.164 --> 23:04.557
Shame what happened.

23:07.168 --> 23:09.257

23:09.300 --> 23:12.042
Hi. This is gonna
sound crazy,

23:12.086 --> 23:13.696
but I used to live in this house
and I was wondering

23:13.740 --> 23:16.220
if I could take a peek inside
for old time'’s sake.
Get out.

23:16.264 --> 23:17.570
COLE: Come on, man.
Five minutes.Get out of here.

23:17.613 --> 23:18.484

Hey, Rog.

24:22.417 --> 24:23.505

are serious gardeners

24:23.549 --> 24:24.854

in the bomb-making game.

24:24.898 --> 24:26.029
All right, this place
is filling up with gas.

24:26.073 --> 24:27.030
We got to get out of here.

Wow. Do I dare ask

25:04.938 --> 25:05.982
how this happened

25:06.026 --> 25:07.723
in the six hours
since I last saw you?

25:07.767 --> 25:10.421
What would you say if I told
you I tripped on a knife?

25:10.465 --> 25:12.075
I'’d say you need a new line.

25:12.119 --> 25:13.599
Worked pretty well for
me on our first date.

25:13.642 --> 25:15.339
That'’s because we were
in an actual war zone

25:15.383 --> 25:16.340
and I had my guard down.

25:16.384 --> 25:18.168
Maybe you should
keep it down.

25:18.212 --> 25:22.738

hurt, learn not to do it again.

hurt you or Maya.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.792
Ouch.

little iffy back then, too.

over there?

25:41.844 --> 25:44.455
HANNI:
Cole!

25:44.499 --> 25:46.588
Hanni.

25:46.632 --> 25:49.504
I lost someone
this last trip.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.811
It'’s why I came back.

25:53.073 --> 25:55.466
I need to make it
right with Maya.

25:55.510 --> 25:58.165
I'’ll never
give up on her.

25:58.208 --> 26:01.342

quitting isn'’t one of them.

26:48.911 --> 26:52.393
I killed my brother,
Martin Riggs.

26:52.436 --> 26:54.743
Shot him in the chest.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.049
I ain'’t asking for forgiveness.

26:56.092 --> 27:01.663
But I know it'’s caused
some people pain.

27:01.707 --> 27:04.884
I thought you should know
the truth.

27:06.668 --> 27:08.670

the case alive

27:44.053 --> 27:48.710

to let him go.

no bigger story.

How did you get her
this audition?

37:15.276 --> 37:16.930
20 years in Special Ops,

37:16.973 --> 37:19.019
you learn how
to work an asset.Sorry I asked.

37:19.062 --> 37:21.456
I'’m joking. I called them
and I begged,

37:21.500 --> 37:23.719
and they took pity on me.

37:23.763 --> 37:25.155
You should try that.

37:26.896 --> 37:30.509
Cole, it'’s not that
I don'’t want you

37:30.552 --> 37:32.467
in Maya'’s life,

37:32.511 --> 37:34.513
I just have to
protect her from the...Chaos?

37:34.556 --> 37:36.297
Yeah.

37:36.341 --> 37:38.821
It'’s always gonna
follow me, Nat.

37:38.865 --> 37:41.781
The difference is that
this time...

37:41.824 --> 37:43.739
I'’m gonna be here
to clean up the mess.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.917
I hope so.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.183
♪ Ooh, I'’m coming home ♪

37:53.227 --> 37:56.056
♪ I'’m coming home... ♪

37:58.276 --> 38:01.540
Okay, Cole,
Thursday at 3:00,

38:01.583 --> 38:03.890
she has a dentist'’s appointment.

38:03.933 --> 38:05.674
You can take her.Perfect.

38:05.718 --> 38:08.982
We'’ll go to the dentist,
Disneyland and then home.

38:09.025 --> 38:10.679
Cole...
Joking.

38:10.723 --> 38:12.028
Disneyland, dentist,
then home.

38:12.072 --> 38:13.682
Cole!
Okay, fine,
forget the dentist.

38:13.726 --> 38:14.683
Just Disneyland.
Let'’s go.

38:14.727 --> 38:15.989
MAYA:
Okay. Bye.

38:22.212 --> 38:23.344
MURTAUGH:
Hey, Riggs,

38:23.388 --> 38:28.218
why am I still cleaning up
after your mess?

38:28.262 --> 38:29.219
This is foul.

38:29.263 --> 38:32.353
This is--
Look at this.

38:32.397 --> 38:34.834
And this is at work.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.975
Enough in there for two?

38:47.716 --> 38:52.242
You know, just to
catch him up on my day.

38:52.286 --> 38:57.813
We'’ve had the best
conversations ever.

38:57.857 --> 39:00.076
Watch.
Hey, Riggs,

39:00.120 --> 39:03.428
I'’m sorry I blew
your truck up.

39:08.302 --> 39:12.393
And I'’m sorry
I wasn'’t there that day.

39:12.437 --> 39:13.742
I wish I was by your side.

39:13.786 --> 39:15.831
Maybe-maybe I could have, uh...

39:18.617 --> 39:21.707
I don'’t know.

39:21.750 --> 39:26.581
But I'’m gonna regret it
for the rest of my life...

39:26.625 --> 39:29.149
'’cause I love you.

39:32.631 --> 39:33.849
Let me try.

39:36.809 --> 39:39.115
Hey, Riggs.

39:39.159 --> 39:42.336
Not a day goes by
that I don'’t miss you.

39:42.380 --> 39:45.600
I will never forget
the impact you had...

39:45.644 --> 39:48.908
on me and my life.

39:52.607 --> 39:55.001
Wow, this is really fun.

39:55.044 --> 39:58.134
Yeah.

39:58.178 --> 39:59.788
I know what he would say.

39:59.832 --> 40:01.442
Hmm?

40:01.486 --> 40:05.185
"Shut up and pass
the spray cheese."

40:06.534 --> 40:08.144
Now that you mention it...

40:13.193 --> 40:14.934
Oh...
Horrible.

40:18.198 --> 40:20.461
It'’s just horrible.

40:20.505 --> 40:21.984
It'’s horrible.

40:32.212 --> 40:35.650
Mm. Now, there'’s
the man I love.

40:35.694 --> 40:37.304
Tell me one thing.Hmm?

40:37.347 --> 40:41.482
Did you burn the sweat suit?

40:41.526 --> 40:44.485
I buried it...
in McNeile'’s backyard.

40:47.532 --> 40:50.012
It'’s time this house
returned back to normal.

40:51.623 --> 40:53.755
Are you thinking
what I'’m thinking?

40:53.799 --> 40:56.497
I think so,
Mrs. Murtaugh.

40:56.541 --> 41:00.109
The gutters need to be cleaned,
the driveway power washed,

41:00.153 --> 41:02.416
and, baby, get rid of the boat.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.505
Love you.

41:04.549 --> 41:08.204
But I don'’t see "you naked"
on this list.

41:11.077 --> 41:13.427

41:16.169 --> 41:18.519

41:20.565 --> 41:23.002
There'’s something
different about you.

41:23.045 --> 41:25.134
Yeah, got a new hat.

41:25.178 --> 41:27.615
I changed my entire outfit.

41:29.312 --> 41:32.533
You know, I'’m, uh, being
transferred to Robbery-Homicide.

41:32.577 --> 41:36.581
From rookie to detective?

41:36.624 --> 41:38.496
You must have friends
in high places.

41:38.539 --> 41:41.455
No, just some cranky old-timer
put in a call to the captain.

41:42.848 --> 41:44.153
I guess he wants
to be my partner.

41:44.197 --> 41:46.591
I guess you can'’t
catch a break.

41:46.634 --> 41:49.898
I mean, bring your ass up
in here and let'’s have a beer.

41:51.421 --> 41:54.163
Now, one thing
you should know

41:54.207 --> 41:56.557
if we'’re going to be
working together is

41:56.601 --> 41:59.952
I take this partnership thing
very seriously.

41:59.995 --> 42:03.477
Yeah, I heard I have some
pretty big shoes to fill.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.957
They were boots.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.133
Old, ratty leather boots.

42:07.176 --> 42:09.309
They used to tuck
into his pants.

42:09.352 --> 42:11.529
I don'’t know how the guy ran.

42:12.747 --> 42:14.488
Yeah, he sounds like
quite a character.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.490
He was.

42:16.534 --> 42:21.800
I can'’t ever replace him,
so I won'’t even try.

42:21.843 --> 42:23.628
But I want to make this work.

42:23.671 --> 42:26.282
I need a job.

42:26.326 --> 42:28.502
Well, it'’s probably
gonna be really slow

42:28.546 --> 42:33.376
compared to your past life,
Mr. CIA.

42:33.420 --> 42:36.989
Man, I bet
you saw some stuff, huh?

42:37.032 --> 42:39.687
Let'’s just say I have
some things to make up for.

42:41.646 --> 42:43.909
Well, the good thing about
having a partner is

42:43.952 --> 42:45.780
you'’re never in it alone.

42:47.390 --> 42:49.915
Sorry, that was pretty corny.

42:49.958 --> 42:51.046
It'’s moving.

42:51.090 --> 42:53.179
Really?
I-I just made that up

42:53.222 --> 42:55.094
just kind of off
the top of my head.

42:55.137 --> 42:57.183
No, no, the boat,
it'’s moving.

43:01.274 --> 43:04.364
Hey... McNeile...

43:04.407 --> 43:06.235
Told you it was an HOA
violation, Big Rog.

43:06.279 --> 43:08.411
Who'’s that guy?My neighbor.

43:08.455 --> 43:09.717
His son used to date
my daughter.

43:09.761 --> 43:13.547
And then we had some
neo-Nazis shootin'’ out.

43:13.591 --> 43:15.288
You know, we got a lot
to catch up on.
