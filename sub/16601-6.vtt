00:13.879 --> 00:15.346
You rang?

00:15.348 --> 00:17.248
Yes, I did.

00:18.485 --> 00:21.352
You might want to sit down.
I got some bad news.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.519
Okay.

00:22.521 --> 00:23.721
I'm sitting down.

00:23.743 --> 00:25.175
A.D.A. Collins

00:25.177 --> 00:27.044
was in a bike accident
this morning

00:27.046 --> 00:28.612
and broke a leg and two ribs.

00:28.614 --> 00:29.647
No.

00:29.649 --> 00:30.815
He'll be fine.

00:30.817 --> 00:32.015
That's not the bad news.

00:32.017 --> 00:33.751
Collins won't be
back in time

00:33.753 --> 00:35.686
to handle the plea
process on this.

00:35.688 --> 00:37.755
I'm asking you to.

00:37.757 --> 00:38.989
What's the case?

00:38.991 --> 00:42.425
Child porn on a hard drive,
over 200 files worth.

00:42.427 --> 00:45.128
The defendant pled
guilty to possessing

00:45.130 --> 00:47.397
sexual performance by a child.

00:47.399 --> 00:48.899
What'd they give for a plea?

00:48.901 --> 00:50.767
The judge capped the sentence
at six years.

00:50.769 --> 00:52.435
I hate this stuff.

00:52.437 --> 00:53.603
I know you do.

00:53.605 --> 00:55.137
Which is why
you're making me take it?

00:55.139 --> 00:56.773
- To toughen me up?
- No.

00:56.775 --> 00:58.575
You're plenty tough as it is.

00:58.577 --> 01:00.677
I just need the negotiation
to be handled quietly

01:00.679 --> 01:03.079
and efficiently.
Take it as a compliment.

01:03.948 --> 01:05.367
These guys turn my stomach.

01:05.391 --> 01:06.649
Mine, too.

01:06.651 --> 01:09.819
But, the defendant
isn't one of "these guys."

01:12.190 --> 01:14.123
It's a woman.

01:14.125 --> 01:16.993
Good eye, Reagan.

01:22.733 --> 01:23.966
Precinct Captain.

01:23.968 --> 01:26.135
Commissioner.

01:29.473 --> 01:31.940
Why are we all
crowded in here?

01:31.942 --> 01:32.808
It's his idea.

01:32.810 --> 01:34.242
Why are we all
crowded in here?

01:34.244 --> 01:37.045
I think I have
some sensitive information.

01:37.047 --> 01:38.747
Well, my office is what, leaky?

01:38.749 --> 01:40.348
No. I'm j...

01:40.350 --> 01:41.884
I don't know what I've got here,

01:41.886 --> 01:43.919
what the implications
of sharing it are.

01:43.921 --> 01:46.554
Well, Baker's name is Baker,
not Rose Mary Woods.

01:46.556 --> 01:48.189
Who's Rose Mary?
Nixon's secretary.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.991
Watergate, the gap in the tapes.

01:49.993 --> 01:50.825
Right, right.

01:50.827 --> 01:52.227
Do we need to whisper?

01:52.229 --> 01:53.828
Close the door!

01:59.469 --> 02:02.403
I was at a retirement racket
for Tom Grassi last night.

02:02.405 --> 02:05.139
Had my job at the state's
attorney general's office.

02:05.141 --> 02:06.307
Full disclosure:

02:06.309 --> 02:07.374
he'd had a few.

02:07.376 --> 02:08.776
Enough to make him unreliable?

02:08.777 --> 02:10.610
No. Just enough
to lubricate

02:10.613 --> 02:11.679
coughing it up.

02:11.681 --> 02:13.280
We'd traded favors
over the years,

02:13.282 --> 02:15.182
and, by his count,
he owed me one.

02:15.184 --> 02:17.017
And the winner is?
According to Grassi,

02:17.019 --> 02:19.486
there's a whistleblower
in the ranks of the NYPD.

02:21.090 --> 02:23.723
A beat cop in a high-crime
precinct feeding Intel

02:23.725 --> 02:25.892
to investigators
with the A.G.'s office.

02:25.894 --> 02:27.027
About what, corruption?

02:27.029 --> 02:27.995
No, I asked him that.

02:27.997 --> 02:29.563
He said more like
abuse of power.

02:29.565 --> 02:31.698
Against who?
The neighborhood population.

02:31.700 --> 02:32.699
In one precinct?

02:32.701 --> 02:34.400
Three.

02:34.402 --> 02:36.035
All high-crime
Brooklyn neighborhoods.

02:36.037 --> 02:37.871
You say "whistleblower,"
I say "rat."

02:37.873 --> 02:40.340
If he's providing accurate
information that's damaging

02:40.342 --> 02:41.908
to this department, he's both.

02:41.910 --> 02:43.810
Depending on
who's shining a light on him,

02:43.812 --> 02:45.645
the information, his motives.

02:45.647 --> 02:47.614
It's all the same light.
No, Sid, it isn't.

02:47.616 --> 02:49.616
We have our perspective,

02:49.618 --> 02:50.984
an activist A.G. has his,

02:50.986 --> 02:53.152
<i>The New York Times,</i>
<i>60 Minutes</i> has theirs.

02:53.154 --> 02:54.553
In this building, he's a rat.

02:54.555 --> 02:56.522
And we need to find out
if he's...

02:56.524 --> 02:58.391
Sorry.

02:58.393 --> 03:00.226
Do we know it's a he?

03:00.228 --> 03:01.160
Yes.

03:01.162 --> 03:04.063
Officer Eric Carlson
of the 6-5.

03:09.303 --> 03:11.904
You sure you don't mind
typing the fives?

03:11.906 --> 03:13.606
Nah, as long as you're telling
the truth about

03:13.608 --> 03:14.607
helping Sean with his project.

03:14.609 --> 03:16.909
I am. I swear.

03:16.911 --> 03:18.010
Science, right?

03:18.012 --> 03:19.812
Yeah, science. Good old science.

03:19.814 --> 03:21.947
You said history before.

03:21.949 --> 03:24.082
History of science.

03:24.084 --> 03:25.683
Did I tell you

03:25.685 --> 03:27.319
that color looks really nice
on you?

03:27.321 --> 03:28.786
I meant
to say that earlier.

03:28.788 --> 03:31.023
It's black.
It's not really a color.

03:31.025 --> 03:33.625
Well, that shade of black.
It's... dark.

03:33.627 --> 03:35.793
It brings out your personality.

03:35.795 --> 03:38.663
Good night, Reagan.

03:38.665 --> 03:42.066
Yeah. Good night.

03:47.607 --> 03:50.875
<i>Gardai! Gardai!</i>

03:53.446 --> 03:54.579
<i>Gardai!</i>

03:54.581 --> 03:58.082
Hey, lady! What are you doing?

03:58.084 --> 04:00.284
<i>Gardai!</i>

04:00.286 --> 04:02.619
Yeah, I'm <i>gardai!</i>
I'm the police!

04:02.621 --> 04:04.821
How 'bout you get out
of the street, okay?!

04:07.626 --> 04:10.361
Hey, I'll come to you!
Get on the sidewalk!

04:10.363 --> 04:11.495
<i>Gardai!</i>

04:18.003 --> 04:19.235
Call 911!

04:19.237 --> 04:22.639
I didn't see her!
My God, is she okay?

04:22.641 --> 04:24.007
I said call 911!

04:28.180 --> 04:30.012
911?
There's been an accident.

04:30.014 --> 04:31.314
A woman's been hit
by a car.

04:31.316 --> 04:33.349
We need an ambulance
right away!

04:42.680 --> 04:49.480
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==
<font color="#00FFFF">@elder_man</font>

05:06.324 --> 05:09.067
...and possessing
a sexual performance by a child

05:09.069 --> 05:10.302
is a class E felony,

05:10.304 --> 05:12.805
carrying a minimum sentence
of one to three years

05:12.807 --> 05:15.740
and a maximum of six
under the plea deal.

05:15.742 --> 05:18.410
Or probation.

05:18.412 --> 05:20.077
Or probation?

05:20.079 --> 05:22.046
Earth to Lawrence.
Come in, Lawrence.

05:22.048 --> 05:23.415
Ms. Duncan has
no prior record

05:23.417 --> 05:24.616
of any kind.

05:24.618 --> 05:27.084
She is a respected piano teacher
and a vocal coach.

05:27.086 --> 05:29.086
She is an active member
of her church and her choir.

05:29.088 --> 05:31.656
Change all the verbs to "was"
and you'd be in the ballpark.

05:31.658 --> 05:32.624
Excuse me?

05:32.626 --> 05:33.958
<i>Was</i> active.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.392
<i>Was</i> respected.

05:35.394 --> 05:37.094
I assume you and your client
are aware

05:37.096 --> 05:38.596
that this charge
changes everything.

05:38.615 --> 05:39.728
I don't like your tone.

05:39.828 --> 05:41.060
And I don't like
you coming in here

05:41.062 --> 05:43.096
like your client
stole a candy bar.

05:43.098 --> 05:44.106
What does that mean?

05:44.130 --> 05:45.500
Come on, Skolnick.

05:45.501 --> 05:46.633
You ever defended

05:46.635 --> 05:48.001
in a child porn
case before?

05:48.003 --> 05:49.068
No.

05:49.070 --> 05:51.371
Let me clue you in.

05:51.373 --> 05:53.039
Your client pled guilty.
Good for her.

05:53.041 --> 05:54.807
Now everyone wants this
to go away.

05:54.809 --> 05:57.476
Which includes her going away.
You got me?

05:57.478 --> 05:58.878
I have defended in many cases

05:58.880 --> 06:00.980
in which mental impairment
is an issue.

06:00.982 --> 06:03.883
Well, good. Because in my book,
downloading child porn

06:03.885 --> 06:06.685
takes a serious level
of mental impairment.

06:06.687 --> 06:07.986
She has been a model citizen
up until this incident.

06:07.988 --> 06:09.822
She showed law
enforcement officials

06:09.824 --> 06:11.256
to her computer
as soon as

06:11.258 --> 06:12.357
they knocked
on the door.

06:12.359 --> 06:13.893
So what? That makes her
mentally impaired?

06:13.895 --> 06:14.860
No.

06:14.862 --> 06:16.529
But this does.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.033
What am I looking at?

06:21.035 --> 06:23.835
Ms. Duncan's brain scans,
pre- and post-op.

06:23.837 --> 06:27.072
Are you familiar with epilepsy,
A.D.A. Reagan?

06:27.074 --> 06:28.540
In the general sense.

06:28.542 --> 06:29.942
Ms. Duncan has epilepsy.

06:29.944 --> 06:31.776
Her seizures became
so disruptive

06:31.778 --> 06:34.246
that she was unable
to lead a normal life.

06:34.248 --> 06:35.948
Epilepsy made her do this?

06:35.950 --> 06:37.282
The treatment for it did.

06:37.284 --> 06:38.216
Which was?

06:38.218 --> 06:39.517
Brain surgery.

06:39.519 --> 06:40.952
Ms. Duncan had a golf-ball-sized

06:40.954 --> 06:43.287
piece of her brain
removed

06:43.289 --> 06:44.889
where the seizures
were most active.

06:44.891 --> 06:46.123
Sounds drastic.

06:46.125 --> 06:47.692
It's more routine
than you would think.

06:47.694 --> 06:49.060
Except this time,
it wasn't.

06:49.062 --> 06:50.462
Ms. Duncan also had
another part

06:50.464 --> 06:52.797
of her brain removed
during this procedure,

06:52.799 --> 06:54.866
the part that controls impulses.

06:54.868 --> 06:57.534
It wasn't me.

06:57.536 --> 06:58.936
It <i>was</i> you.

06:58.938 --> 07:01.405
And you admitted as much
when you pled guilty.

07:01.407 --> 07:04.041
Ms. Reagan, I meant...

07:04.043 --> 07:06.543
it wasn't me in here.

07:06.545 --> 07:10.348
I know what was in my computer,
and I owned up to it.

07:10.350 --> 07:14.685
But I never in a million years
could have done that.

07:14.687 --> 07:17.220
Before.

07:18.991 --> 07:21.558
You realize
how convenient this sounds?

07:21.560 --> 07:23.660
Run it by your own experts.

07:23.662 --> 07:26.096
You can be sure I will.

07:26.098 --> 07:28.465
In the meantime,
the People will recommend

07:28.467 --> 07:31.634
the maximum sentence allowed.

07:34.339 --> 07:36.439
She say anything back
when you called out to her?

07:36.441 --> 07:38.308
She just kept yelling
<i>"Gardai, Gardai."</i>

07:38.310 --> 07:39.642
<i>"Gardai"?</i> What's <i>"Gardai"?</i>

07:39.644 --> 07:41.644
Well, it's Irish
for "police."

07:41.646 --> 07:43.346
What's with all the questions?
What's on your mind?

07:43.348 --> 07:45.414
Detective, getting hit
by that car was what killed her,

07:45.416 --> 07:46.749
but she was already gone.

07:46.751 --> 07:48.250
I'm amazed
she could walk or talk.

07:48.252 --> 07:49.418
What do you mean?

07:49.420 --> 07:51.888
She had a blood alcohol level
of .11 in her system

07:51.890 --> 07:53.489
and a half gram
of cocaine.

07:53.491 --> 07:55.591
Okay, but that's not usually
enough to be lethal.

07:55.593 --> 07:57.393
Depends what it's cut with.

07:57.395 --> 08:00.596
Like when it's laced with
a synthetic opiate called W-18.

08:00.598 --> 08:02.398
The amount in her system
would O.D. her

08:02.400 --> 08:03.698
and her whole village
back home.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.235
Okay, some new party
cocktail making the rounds?

08:06.237 --> 08:07.269
Not that I'm aware of.

08:07.271 --> 08:10.605
My point is, no one parties
this hard by choice.

08:10.607 --> 08:13.442
I found fresh needle marks
behind her knee.

08:13.444 --> 08:14.843
Think that's a hot shot?

08:14.845 --> 08:16.445
Or a suicide.

08:20.918 --> 08:23.985
Okay. But suicides don't
usually go calling for help

08:23.987 --> 08:26.187
after they pull the trigger.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.724
All of 19 years old.

08:29.726 --> 08:31.526
And over here for a summer job
at Jimmy Quinn's

08:31.528 --> 08:33.761
from a one-pub town
outside Kilkelly.

08:33.764 --> 08:36.464
You say "Jimmy Quinn's"
like I should know the place.

08:36.466 --> 08:39.967
Well, it's not just a place--
it's a legend, Jimmy Quinn's.

08:39.969 --> 08:41.902
The original one's in Montauk.
His kids opened

08:41.904 --> 08:43.136
a few over here in the '90s.

08:43.139 --> 08:45.073
But great steaks,
big drinks, and--

08:45.075 --> 08:47.275
let me tell you something--
the cute little Irish help

08:47.277 --> 08:49.043
in the summertimes
does not hurt business.

08:49.045 --> 08:50.611
Spoken like one who knows.

08:50.613 --> 08:54.748
Well, there was redheaded
Caitlin from County Cork.

08:54.750 --> 08:57.084
For one magical summer
in the last century.

08:57.086 --> 08:59.687
So I take it I'm gonna
meet Jimmy Quinn?

08:59.689 --> 09:01.154
Actually, Jimmy Quinn, Jr.

09:01.156 --> 09:03.557
Not sure he has the same
Irish twinkle in his eye

09:03.559 --> 09:06.760
that his old man had, but bring
your shades just in case.

09:07.796 --> 09:09.896
...also requested
two transfers...

09:09.898 --> 09:11.498
No. First, one thing.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.067
Garrett,

09:14.069 --> 09:16.536
Grassi said he owed you one
after a few drinks.

09:16.538 --> 09:17.971
Maybe you had a couple, too?

09:17.973 --> 09:19.573
Yes.
Well, then is there

09:19.575 --> 09:21.575
any version of this
where he meant,

09:21.577 --> 09:24.477
"You screwed me, I owe you one"?
Owed you that way?

09:24.479 --> 09:26.412
No. He owed me a solid.

09:26.414 --> 09:29.916
Okay, then I got to ask,
owed you a solid for what?

09:29.918 --> 09:32.418
Nothing from here.

09:32.420 --> 09:33.753
I'll ask again. For what?

09:33.755 --> 09:35.121
For dirt on city hall.

09:35.123 --> 09:37.824
And I'm gonna ask you
to trust my judgment

09:37.826 --> 09:41.160
and not ask me
any more about it.

09:43.764 --> 09:45.897
And, Lieutenant, you got what?

09:45.899 --> 09:48.834
Carlson requested two transfers
in 21 months.

09:48.836 --> 09:50.102
That's three precincts.

09:50.104 --> 09:52.171
Two in Brooklyn South,
one in Brooklyn North.

09:52.173 --> 09:53.839
And his profile?

09:53.841 --> 09:55.141
Goes along, gets along.

09:55.143 --> 09:56.908
Not exactly a big collar guy

09:56.910 --> 09:58.810
but a presence on the street
that's earned him

09:58.812 --> 10:00.345
some commendations
in the community.

10:00.347 --> 10:01.980
Yeah. And now in the 6-5?

10:01.982 --> 10:03.081
Going on seven months.

10:03.083 --> 10:05.283
Ward Gibson's
his C.O. over there.

10:07.121 --> 10:08.386
Off-duty, off-site,

10:08.388 --> 10:10.822
off the record
as soon as possible.

10:10.824 --> 10:12.958
Got it, boss.

10:20.534 --> 10:23.401
It's called
Kluver-Bucy syndrome.

10:23.403 --> 10:24.902
It occurs in patients

10:24.904 --> 10:27.972
when there's been damage
in the medial temporal lobe.

10:27.974 --> 10:28.973
Translation?

10:28.975 --> 10:30.641
The defense
may be right.

10:30.643 --> 10:33.443
This is a well documented
phenomenon that often results

10:33.445 --> 10:36.380
in uncontrollable
hypersexuality.

10:36.382 --> 10:38.215
Okay. So lacking control.

10:38.217 --> 10:39.850
What about awareness?

10:39.852 --> 10:42.153
If she was suffering delusions
at the time,

10:42.155 --> 10:43.620
she may have lacked that, too.

10:43.622 --> 10:45.389
But?

10:45.391 --> 10:47.524
But it would require
evaluation of the subject

10:47.526 --> 10:49.159
beyond these scans.

10:49.161 --> 10:50.960
Okay. I'm gonna need you
to do that.

10:50.962 --> 10:53.263
You've brought me
a lot of interesting cases

10:53.265 --> 10:54.498
over the years, Erin,

10:54.500 --> 10:56.600
but this one's maybe

10:56.602 --> 10:58.468
too interesting.

10:58.470 --> 11:02.005
You just said
the defense may be right.

11:02.007 --> 11:04.841
There's more at stake here
than just right or wrong.

11:04.843 --> 11:07.643
No, those are the stakes,
always.

11:07.645 --> 11:11.181
Say I did evaluate her
and supported the defense.

11:11.183 --> 11:14.250
And you, in turn,
supported a lesser sentence.

11:14.252 --> 11:17.520
Erin, let's be clear.

11:17.522 --> 11:20.323
This is for possession
of child pornography.

11:20.325 --> 11:23.326
There's no justification
or excuse that the people

11:23.328 --> 11:25.861
who place their trust in us
will accept.

11:25.863 --> 11:29.432
That may be true,
but it doesn't make it right.

11:29.434 --> 11:32.868
Right or wrong,
it is what it is.

11:32.870 --> 11:34.437
Sorry. I can't help.

11:43.848 --> 11:44.913
Rebecca.

11:44.915 --> 11:46.081
When she walked in a room,

11:46.083 --> 11:47.950
it was like the sun came in
right behind her.

11:47.952 --> 11:49.184
Yeah. Okay.

11:49.186 --> 11:51.820
But again, I need you
to think here, Jimmy, okay?

11:51.822 --> 11:54.055
How about a customer
or coworker?

11:54.057 --> 11:55.823
I run a clean place.

11:55.825 --> 11:57.359
We're not trying
to say otherwise.

11:57.361 --> 11:58.793
I vet every dishwasher.

11:58.795 --> 12:00.094
I know most every customer

12:00.096 --> 12:01.263
like they were family.

12:01.265 --> 12:02.430
Let's start
with coworkers.

12:02.432 --> 12:04.599
Any beefs?
No.

12:04.601 --> 12:06.534
Any romances gone bad?

12:06.536 --> 12:09.270
There are no romances
among the staff here.

12:09.272 --> 12:10.404
Come on.

12:10.406 --> 12:12.373
Beautiful young girl
in the big city

12:12.375 --> 12:14.642
all by herself for
the very first time.

12:14.644 --> 12:15.877
Jimmy Quinn's has been

12:15.879 --> 12:17.078
a thriving business

12:17.080 --> 12:19.947
for over 40 years,
'cause we have rules.

12:19.949 --> 12:22.549
And one of those rules is no
fooling around among the staff.

12:22.551 --> 12:24.952
And no dipping in the register,
pouring from the top shelf

12:24.954 --> 12:26.320
for the staff
drinks, right?

12:26.322 --> 12:27.721
Look, I hear
what you're saying, Detective,

12:27.723 --> 12:28.789
but no.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.857
Everyone who
works here signs

12:30.859 --> 12:32.092
a non-fraternization agreement.

12:32.094 --> 12:34.194
Excuse me a sec.
Where's the ladies' room?

12:34.196 --> 12:36.363
Before the kitchen doors,
to the right.

12:36.365 --> 12:38.599
I'll be right right back.

12:40.169 --> 12:42.803
So what time did Rebecca
leave last night?

12:42.805 --> 12:44.171
Well, we slowed

12:44.173 --> 12:47.808
way down after happy hour,
so I let her go around 9:00.

12:55.150 --> 12:57.517
Talk to me.

12:57.519 --> 12:59.452
Rebecca was a friend of mine.

12:59.454 --> 13:00.853
We met on the flight over.

13:00.855 --> 13:02.522
And?

13:02.524 --> 13:05.658
That no hooking up
amongst the staff policy--

13:05.660 --> 13:07.126
the staff work together hard

13:07.128 --> 13:09.395
to make sure Mr. Quinn
believes it's working.

13:09.397 --> 13:10.363
Though it isn't.

13:10.365 --> 13:13.098
Maybe it did,
in the last century.

13:13.100 --> 13:14.767
Yeah, I doubt even then.

13:14.769 --> 13:16.335
Who was Rebecca hooking up with?

13:16.337 --> 13:19.438
Sean. One of the bartenders.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.240
Who's a bad guy?

13:21.242 --> 13:22.908
No. He's a good guy.

13:22.910 --> 13:24.910
But I can tell you...

13:26.747 --> 13:29.648
...the moment she got off shift,
she'd be headed to him.

13:29.650 --> 13:32.584
Do you know
where I can find him?

13:32.586 --> 13:36.421
I went with her to a couple
of parties at his flat.

13:39.727 --> 13:44.062
And your expert says this
syndrome... what's it called?

13:44.064 --> 13:46.431
Two words: Kluver-Bucy.

13:46.433 --> 13:48.099
Would hold water
as a mitigating factor?

13:48.101 --> 13:49.033
Yes.

13:49.035 --> 13:51.836
But is unwilling
to testify to same.

13:51.838 --> 13:54.272
No. She will not testify.
Well, then,

13:54.274 --> 13:58.309
I've got two words for you:
child pornography.

13:58.311 --> 14:00.311
What is that
supposed to mean?

14:00.313 --> 14:02.981
Two words that together run neck
and neck with child molester

14:02.983 --> 14:04.548
as the charges
that bring everybody,

14:04.550 --> 14:07.150
and I do mean everybody,
together.

14:07.152 --> 14:09.086
This is not
a political campaign.

14:09.088 --> 14:10.521
Sometimes it is.

14:10.523 --> 14:12.322
And this is one of those times.

14:12.324 --> 14:14.859
Why did your doc back out?
Can I guess?

14:14.861 --> 14:16.527
You don't have to;
you know why.

14:16.529 --> 14:17.528
Yes, I do.

14:17.530 --> 14:18.763
Because she's smart

14:18.765 --> 14:20.464
and likes making her living
the way she does,

14:20.466 --> 14:22.499
and so do I,
and so do you, last I heard.

14:22.501 --> 14:25.936
Coupled with the fact
that the defendant is female,

14:25.938 --> 14:29.039
this case could have
major precedence in the courts.

14:29.041 --> 14:32.042
And this case could backfire
and paint this office

14:32.044 --> 14:33.810
as some kind of
bed-and-breakfast

14:33.812 --> 14:35.612
that's soft on child porn.

14:35.614 --> 14:37.847
The defense presented
medical evidence.

14:37.849 --> 14:40.383
We can't just ignore it
to protect our image.

14:40.385 --> 14:42.585
You say image, I say reputation.

14:42.587 --> 14:44.587
Do you really think
she's innocent?

14:44.589 --> 14:47.089
I didn't say that.

14:47.091 --> 14:50.126
And now you are talking
like it's a political campaign.

14:51.329 --> 14:53.162
She pled guilty.

14:53.164 --> 14:54.863
I just think
there's a strong argument

14:54.865 --> 14:57.800
that the blame
is not entirely hers to bear.

14:59.203 --> 15:01.137
Anyway, we're done here.

15:01.139 --> 15:02.471
We are?

15:02.473 --> 15:04.573
You assigned me to take over
the plea process on this case.

15:04.575 --> 15:05.774
Are you taking me off of it?

15:05.776 --> 15:07.410
No, but...
Then I'll keep you posted.

15:18.436 --> 15:22.303
Right now, we don't have
anything but a tip,

15:22.305 --> 15:25.574
and we don't know much about
what kind of information

15:25.576 --> 15:27.876
is allegedly being passed up.

15:27.878 --> 15:30.679
Well, you've covered all
the legal requirements, boss.

15:30.681 --> 15:33.649
The officer in question
is assigned to your precinct.

15:33.651 --> 15:34.683
Kinda figured that.

15:34.685 --> 15:35.917
He transferred in from...

15:35.919 --> 15:37.385
Hold on a second.

15:37.387 --> 15:38.753
There a problem, Ward?

15:38.755 --> 15:41.289
I take pride in my job.

15:41.291 --> 15:43.658
I know you do.

15:43.660 --> 15:46.661
So I'd like to think that if
a cop in my command turned rat,

15:46.663 --> 15:48.163
I'd have a pretty good guess.

15:48.165 --> 15:49.897
We're not saying he's a rat.

15:49.899 --> 15:52.332
Polite name is "whistleblower."

15:53.169 --> 15:54.569
Swede?

15:54.571 --> 15:56.470
Officer Eric Carlson?

15:56.472 --> 15:57.838
Yeah. We call him Swede.

15:57.840 --> 15:58.906
That's the name we got.

15:58.908 --> 16:00.207
Why'd you guess him?

16:00.209 --> 16:02.843
Don't get me wrong, good cop.

16:02.845 --> 16:05.379
Pain in the ass, but a good cop.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.781
Pain in the ass how?

16:06.783 --> 16:09.149
Opinionated. Which is fine.

16:09.151 --> 16:10.250
I encourage

16:10.252 --> 16:11.851
an open exchange
of opinions.

16:11.853 --> 16:14.721
I checked with his
previous C.O.s, same story.

16:14.723 --> 16:17.057
He'd voice a complaint, and if
you didn't take it as gospel,

16:17.059 --> 16:18.625
he'd try to go
up and around you.

16:18.627 --> 16:21.228
Daily? Weekly?

16:21.230 --> 16:23.863
You know, now that I'm thinking,
we had a come-to-Jesus

16:23.865 --> 16:25.599
a month ago.

16:25.601 --> 16:27.166
And here I am thinking
I got through to him.

16:27.168 --> 16:29.002
That he was
one of my boyos.

16:29.004 --> 16:30.971
We even went
to the range together.

16:30.973 --> 16:32.438
Thanks for this, Ward.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.040
I don't know
what you're thanking me for.

16:34.042 --> 16:35.208
I got a rat on my watch.

16:35.210 --> 16:37.711
For your honesty;
I know it ain't easy.

16:37.713 --> 16:39.512
Look.

16:39.514 --> 16:40.880
We don't know what we've got,

16:40.882 --> 16:44.317
so I do not want you
to do a thing, understood?

16:44.319 --> 16:45.651
Understood.

16:45.653 --> 16:47.987
This meeting never happened.

16:47.989 --> 16:49.422
Excuse me.

17:03.804 --> 17:04.903
Sean Bartch?

17:04.905 --> 17:06.304
Not here.

17:06.306 --> 17:07.339
It's the police.

17:07.340 --> 17:08.973
Detective Reagan and Baez.

17:08.976 --> 17:10.308
You here now?

17:17.251 --> 17:19.717
I was at my friend's bar,
the Philidor.

17:19.719 --> 17:21.953
I can get you his
number if you want.

17:21.954 --> 17:23.421
Yeah, we do.

17:23.423 --> 17:24.922
What time
were you there till?

17:24.924 --> 17:27.559
...last call.

17:27.560 --> 17:30.094
And Rebecca
was gonna meet you there?

17:30.096 --> 17:31.462
I was hoping so.

17:31.464 --> 17:32.563
What's that mean?

17:32.565 --> 17:34.766
Means we kind of had a fight,

17:34.768 --> 17:37.301
and, I was hoping
she'd gotten over it,

17:37.303 --> 17:40.772
but I'm never gonna know, so...

17:40.774 --> 17:42.707
So the witnesses
at the Philidor

17:42.709 --> 17:44.976
will say you were there
when to when?

17:44.978 --> 17:49.246
Like, 8:00
to 2:00, 2:15-- I don't know.

17:49.248 --> 17:50.614
I was helping out
behind the bar

17:50.616 --> 17:53.050
from about 11:00
to last call, so...

17:53.052 --> 17:54.218
Good.

17:54.220 --> 17:55.752
Why don't you
call over there,

17:55.754 --> 17:57.188
check it out.

17:58.491 --> 17:59.990
Hey, look at me.

17:59.992 --> 18:02.393
It's time you cut the crap
and get real with me right now.

18:02.395 --> 18:03.460
What the hell's going on?

18:03.462 --> 18:04.728
I don't-- I was
nowhere near her, man.

18:04.730 --> 18:06.429
I wish I had been.

18:06.431 --> 18:07.731
What happened?

18:07.733 --> 18:09.265
She got hit by a car.

18:10.703 --> 18:12.569
That's not why you're here.
No.

18:12.571 --> 18:15.538
She got hit by a car
and she was pumped up with coke

18:15.540 --> 18:17.207
that was laced with W-18.

18:19.277 --> 18:21.043
You ever heard of that?

18:21.045 --> 18:22.878
Yeah. Yeah, I've heard of that.

18:22.880 --> 18:25.682
Um... I've never tried it,
but...

18:26.651 --> 18:28.284
But she did.

18:28.286 --> 18:29.785
Was Rebecca game for anything?

18:29.787 --> 18:32.255
No, man.

18:32.257 --> 18:33.623
Nothing like that, no.

18:33.625 --> 18:34.890
Well, she was that night.

18:35.793 --> 18:37.292
You do coke with her?

18:37.294 --> 18:38.761
No.

18:38.763 --> 18:40.796
She-- God, she'd-she'd do,
like, a few beers,

18:40.798 --> 18:42.264
a couple of shots, that was it.

18:42.266 --> 18:44.533
So she only did beer
and a couple of shots,

18:44.535 --> 18:47.903
but this night she does a whole
bunch of coke with W-18 in it?

18:48.940 --> 18:50.439
What were you two
fighting about?

18:52.309 --> 18:54.476
She, flirted all the time.

18:54.478 --> 18:56.911
It was...

18:56.913 --> 18:58.847
you know, it drove me crazy,
but she always said

18:58.849 --> 19:01.116
it was just 'cause she, 
had to do it for show,

19:01.118 --> 19:03.752
'cause she had to pretend
to be single, so...

19:03.754 --> 19:05.053
Because of
Jimmy Quinn's policies?

19:05.055 --> 19:06.588
Yeah.

19:06.590 --> 19:08.624
And I'm, I'm not usually
the jealous type.

19:08.626 --> 19:10.558
Let's suppose your suspicions
were right.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.227
Which guy would it be?

19:12.229 --> 19:14.195
I don't think she was, man.

19:14.197 --> 19:15.196
Come on.

19:15.198 --> 19:16.364
Fights like that don't happen

19:16.366 --> 19:18.599
because of the entire
male species, all right?

19:18.601 --> 19:20.468
Somebody set it off;
who was it?

19:20.470 --> 19:23.304
No. It was just, like...

19:23.306 --> 19:25.206
I mean, you know
what she looked like?

19:25.208 --> 19:26.440
Yeah. I know
what she looked like.

19:26.442 --> 19:27.475
It was like every guy

19:27.477 --> 19:28.909
who came in there was trying to,

19:28.911 --> 19:29.977
trying to get her number.

19:29.979 --> 19:31.945
You know, she said
because of her job,

19:31.947 --> 19:33.180
she had to make them all

19:33.182 --> 19:35.283
feel like "possibly,"
but that was it.

19:37.353 --> 19:38.986
There's about six or
seven over at the Philidor

19:38.988 --> 19:40.321
who were there last night.

19:40.323 --> 19:42.222
They'll stay till we
get there to interview.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.791
Good.

19:43.793 --> 19:46.193
Man, everything I'm saying
is true, I swear.

19:46.195 --> 19:48.295
Then don't leave town.

20:01.009 --> 20:02.475
Ms. Collins.

20:02.477 --> 20:05.312
Siobhan Collins.
Detective Reagan.

20:05.314 --> 20:07.547
I was wondering if I could
have a moment of your time.

20:07.549 --> 20:08.782
Sure.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.420
I'm really...

20:13.422 --> 20:16.222
sorry for your loss.

20:16.224 --> 20:19.725
I'm trying to determine
what may have caused,

20:19.727 --> 20:21.127
or led to your daughter's death.

20:21.129 --> 20:23.162
And I was wondering
if you could help.

20:23.164 --> 20:25.331
I don't know
how I could help.

20:25.333 --> 20:26.699
When you were contacted

20:26.701 --> 20:29.135
by the department
as next of kin,

20:29.137 --> 20:30.970
you were already on a plane

20:30.972 --> 20:33.672
on your way over here
to the States.

20:33.674 --> 20:35.507
I was wondering why.

20:35.509 --> 20:39.378
Rebecca asked me to come over
to talk to Mr. Quinn with her,

20:39.380 --> 20:42.348
and then to take her right
to the airport and home.

20:42.350 --> 20:44.182
Talk about what?

20:44.184 --> 20:47.619
To blow the whistle
that drugs were being dealt

20:47.621 --> 20:49.321
out of his restaurant.

20:49.323 --> 20:51.522
She felt strongly
that we owed him that.

20:51.524 --> 20:54.625
And did she mention
a Sean Bartch to you?

20:54.627 --> 20:55.827
Yes.

20:55.829 --> 20:59.797
I'm afraid she inherited
my bad taste in men.

20:59.799 --> 21:02.433
So, this was
his operation, then?

21:02.435 --> 21:06.504
Well, according to Rebecca,
it was Sean and...

21:06.506 --> 21:08.840
another bartender,
working both out of here

21:08.842 --> 21:11.342
and in Montauk.

21:11.344 --> 21:15.780
Do you have any proof
of this, Ms. Collins?

21:15.782 --> 21:18.616
As far as I'm concerned,

21:18.618 --> 21:22.419
I'm flying the proof home
with me in her casket.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.895
What'd you say
to Dr. Sumardi?

21:30.897 --> 21:34.198
She's got a nice side business
going as an expert witness.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.133
I'd hate to see it dry up.

21:36.135 --> 21:37.968
Which one are you rooting for?

21:37.970 --> 21:39.836
What do you mean?

21:39.838 --> 21:41.904
For the doc to agree
to testify for Duncan,

21:41.906 --> 21:43.806
or for her
to pass this buck again.

21:43.808 --> 21:45.708
I'm rooting for justice.

21:45.710 --> 21:47.410
Give me a break.

21:47.412 --> 21:50.078
She declines to testify,
you're off the hook.

21:50.080 --> 21:52.615
But if she agrees
to support the defendant,

21:52.617 --> 21:55.117
you've doubled down on
pushing for the minimum sentence

21:55.119 --> 21:56.952
in a child porn case.

21:56.954 --> 21:58.987
Sticking with justice.

21:58.989 --> 22:00.555
What I am rooting for is,

22:00.557 --> 22:02.757
next time you want
to dump something like this

22:02.759 --> 22:05.027
on someone's lap,
you walk right by me.

22:05.029 --> 22:08.797
Won't happen, but it's fair.

22:18.374 --> 22:19.674
Sean was in here earlier.

22:19.676 --> 22:21.409
Said he left
his wallet in his locker.

22:21.411 --> 22:23.778
Great. Let's see if he left
anything else. Which one?

22:23.780 --> 22:25.313
Right here.

22:25.315 --> 22:26.347
Right here.

22:26.349 --> 22:28.015
All right, I need
your permission

22:28.017 --> 22:29.918
as the owner
of this establishment.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.218
Yes, please, go.

22:31.220 --> 22:32.980
- Great. Could you step back, please?
- Yeah.

22:34.857 --> 22:37.024
All right.

22:45.468 --> 22:48.569
Come to papa.

22:48.571 --> 22:50.003
Finders keepers.

22:50.639 --> 22:51.839
What is that?

22:51.841 --> 22:52.940
Well, it looks like

22:52.942 --> 22:55.509
grams of cocaine
in the convenient pocket size.

22:55.511 --> 22:57.644
I had no idea.

22:57.646 --> 22:59.112
Who's he run with?

22:59.114 --> 23:00.213
What do you mean?

23:00.215 --> 23:02.649
Well, you make it your business
to stay

23:02.651 --> 23:04.050
in your employees'
business, right?

23:04.052 --> 23:05.185
Who's he run with?

23:05.187 --> 23:06.853
Who does he do shifts with?

23:06.855 --> 23:08.021
Derrick Sanders.

23:08.023 --> 23:09.722
He's out working Montauk
for the week.

23:09.724 --> 23:13.360
Montauk. Good. Okay.

23:16.898 --> 23:18.264
Sean Bartch,

23:18.266 --> 23:20.500
drop the bag, keep your hands
where I can see 'em!

23:20.502 --> 23:22.101
Hey! Where you going, buddy?
Turn around.

23:22.103 --> 23:24.637
Hands on your head.
Lock your fingers.

23:24.639 --> 23:27.206
Could have sworn I told
you not to leave town.

23:27.208 --> 23:28.440
You got the wrong guy.

23:28.442 --> 23:30.409
That's a new one.
I swear.

23:30.411 --> 23:32.077
You have the
right to remain silent.

23:32.079 --> 23:34.747
So why don't you do me
a favor: shut up. Come on.

23:47.370 --> 23:49.634
And she was
exceptionally candid.

23:49.734 --> 23:51.601
She admitted that
on occasion,

23:51.603 --> 23:54.303
her feelings towards some of
her pupils could cross a line

23:54.305 --> 23:57.707
into fantasies of voyeurism
and physical intimacy.

23:57.709 --> 24:00.543
There's never been a single
complaint filed against her,

24:00.545 --> 24:02.144
not even a whisper.

24:02.146 --> 24:06.248
Aside from the hundreds of files
on her computer, for the record.

24:06.250 --> 24:09.484
I reviewed enough of the seized
material to be fairly certain

24:09.486 --> 24:12.187
that her account lines
up with the evidence.

24:12.189 --> 24:14.623
It's child porn
any way you slice it.

24:14.625 --> 24:16.525
It's exclusively
depictions of

24:16.527 --> 24:19.861
clearly post-pubescent boys
engaging in masturbation.

24:19.863 --> 24:23.565
In my opinion, the impulse
controls that were removed

24:23.567 --> 24:26.000
as a result of the
surgery manifested

24:26.002 --> 24:28.470
in the wholly
uncharacteristic action

24:28.472 --> 24:31.807
of searching for and
downloading those images.

24:31.809 --> 24:35.109
And you'd be willing
to testify on her behalf?

24:35.111 --> 24:36.844
To these specific points.

24:36.846 --> 24:40.048
But if you try
to steer me into an agenda,

24:40.050 --> 24:42.984
I'll be gone
in the next instant.

24:42.986 --> 24:46.520
The witness does not set
guidelines for the prosecution.

24:46.522 --> 24:49.057
Take it or leave it.

24:51.761 --> 24:55.128
All I want is for you
to provide expert testimony

24:55.130 --> 24:57.230
on the viability of her claim.

24:57.232 --> 24:59.299
That I can do.

25:01.070 --> 25:03.170
Last call.
You're gonna help me,

25:03.172 --> 25:07.107
or I'm gonna mop the floor
with you, you understand?

25:07.109 --> 25:09.042
And then you're cut off.

25:09.044 --> 25:10.677
And cut off around here means

25:10.679 --> 25:12.645
central booking,
then straight to Rikers!

25:13.949 --> 25:16.383
Three!

25:16.385 --> 25:18.018
Two!
All right.

25:18.020 --> 25:19.919
All right. Yeah.

25:19.921 --> 25:21.355
She knew about the drugs.

25:21.357 --> 25:22.922
She? Rebecca?

25:22.924 --> 25:24.557
Yeah.

25:24.559 --> 25:26.559
I wanted her to stay here
in America,

25:26.561 --> 25:29.963
so I told her that I made more
than just a bartender,

25:29.965 --> 25:31.498
and I could support her.

25:31.500 --> 25:34.066
She asked how you could
support her, right?

25:34.068 --> 25:35.735
And I told her.

25:35.737 --> 25:37.203
To keep her here.

25:37.205 --> 25:39.305
But you didn't keep her.
You lost her. How?

25:39.307 --> 25:41.640
How?!

25:42.443 --> 25:45.244
I told Derrick
that I told her.

25:47.148 --> 25:48.247
We don't keep secrets,
him and me.

25:48.249 --> 25:50.483
So you think Derrick did it.

25:50.485 --> 25:52.318
Well, ever since
you came to my apartment

25:52.320 --> 25:54.086
and mentioned W-18, yeah.

25:54.088 --> 25:55.988
He the only one
who cuts with it?

25:55.990 --> 25:57.255
He's the only one I know.

25:57.257 --> 25:59.057
Then why didn't you
say something then?

26:00.661 --> 26:03.261
'Cause I didn't think that
he would do something like this.

26:03.263 --> 26:06.598
Look, man, this whole thing-- it
was just supposed to be, like,

26:06.600 --> 26:08.867
providing a service on the side,
but he got greedy.

26:08.869 --> 26:11.069
And you talked
to him about that?

26:11.071 --> 26:12.604
Did he admit to it?

26:13.840 --> 26:16.508
That's why I was
getting on that jitney.

26:16.510 --> 26:19.010
Go out to Montauk,
talk to him, face to face.

26:20.947 --> 26:24.982
Well, look, you still got
a chance to do that.

26:24.984 --> 26:27.152
What?
To get him to admit it.

26:27.154 --> 26:29.387
I mean, you dragged
Rebecca into this;

26:29.389 --> 26:31.689
you're part of the reason
she's dead.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.727
You want a shot
at redemption or not?

26:39.398 --> 26:41.365
I'll do anything.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.734
Good.

26:49.841 --> 26:52.509
I used every can
opener and crowbar,

26:52.511 --> 26:54.311
called in every
chit and favor.

26:54.313 --> 26:56.713
If Officer Carlson is
passing up anything

26:56.715 --> 26:58.648
truly damaging,
I can't get at it.

26:58.650 --> 26:59.849
Are we being played here?

26:59.851 --> 27:01.485
No. I checked
back with Grassi.

27:01.487 --> 27:03.620
Carlson is
Officer Zero in this.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.354
Whatever "this" is.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.825
Carlson's in the hospital.
What for?

27:08.827 --> 27:10.493
Captain Gibson demanded access

27:10.495 --> 27:12.361
to his apartment
without permission.

27:12.363 --> 27:15.331
The super called Carlson.
Apparently, they're friendly.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.634
Carlson came back home
and confronted Gibson,

27:17.636 --> 27:19.069
had him red-handed right there.

27:19.071 --> 27:21.370
Son of a bitch.
I told Ward to lay off.

27:21.372 --> 27:22.438
His pride won out.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.773
Punches thrown?
No. Just a lot of yelling.

27:24.775 --> 27:26.709
Well, then what the hell's
he in the hospital for?

27:26.711 --> 27:27.910
Gibson called for backup

27:27.912 --> 27:29.812
and had Carlson checked in
to the psych ward.

27:29.814 --> 27:31.714
What the hell?
When?

27:31.716 --> 27:33.048
Late last night.
Why the psych ward?

27:33.050 --> 27:35.318
Because he's smart.
If Carlson is a rat...

27:35.320 --> 27:36.752
He'll look a lot less reliable

27:36.754 --> 27:40.422
if his own C.O. had him
committed to the psych ward.

27:46.764 --> 27:49.098
Docket number 435286,

27:49.100 --> 27:52.300
<i>The People v. Katherine Duncan.</i>

27:54.404 --> 27:55.770
Defendant has been charged

27:55.772 --> 27:57.705
with possessing a sexual
performance by a child.

27:57.707 --> 27:59.741
I understand both sides
have recommendations

27:59.743 --> 28:00.975
for sentencing?

28:00.977 --> 28:01.976
Yes, Your Honor.

28:01.978 --> 28:04.246
The People will
be recommending

28:04.248 --> 28:06.481
the minimum sentence
of one to three years.

28:07.951 --> 28:10.918
We believe Ms. Duncan's actions
were not fully in her control

28:10.920 --> 28:13.354
due to complications
following a medical procedure,

28:13.356 --> 28:15.221
as shown in records previously

28:15.223 --> 28:17.323
submitted to this court.
And the defense?

28:17.325 --> 28:19.492
Defense recommends
two years probation,

28:19.494 --> 28:20.927
plus mandatory therapy.

28:20.929 --> 28:24.464
Approach the bench, both of you.

28:26.802 --> 28:28.669
Are you two serious?
For child porn?

28:28.671 --> 28:29.836
I believe there are
medical factors...

28:29.838 --> 28:31.271
Yeah, I know. I heard you.

28:31.273 --> 28:32.539
Well, if necessary,

28:32.541 --> 28:34.974
will you hear the testimony
of an expert witness

28:34.976 --> 28:37.377
to the same point
on behalf of Ms. Duncan?

28:37.379 --> 28:38.478
Sure I will.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.713
So, probation
and a minimum sentence?

28:40.715 --> 28:42.682
This is... is this
what you two worked out?

28:42.684 --> 28:44.016
For Your Honor's consideration.

28:44.018 --> 28:45.451
"For Your Honor's
consideration"

28:45.453 --> 28:48.620
of the steaming pile of crap you
just plopped down on my bench.

28:48.622 --> 28:50.756
It is this
A.D.A.'s opinion

28:50.758 --> 28:53.826
that it's my duty to
advocate for a fair and just

28:53.828 --> 28:54.927
sentencing in this case.

28:54.929 --> 28:56.896
Do you understand the position
this puts me in?

28:56.898 --> 28:59.832
Hopefully in the position to
consider this case objectively

28:59.834 --> 29:01.801
and not subjectively,
Your Honor.

29:01.803 --> 29:03.202
Step away, please.

29:07.974 --> 29:09.974
I am not prepared to
hand down a sentence

29:09.976 --> 29:11.643
of probation at this
time, nor to consider

29:11.645 --> 29:13.945
a minimum sentence as
proposed by the People.

29:13.947 --> 29:15.780
Will you
consider reducing

29:15.782 --> 29:17.583
the cap on sentencing,
Your Honor?

29:17.585 --> 29:19.150
The cap will remain
at six years.

29:19.152 --> 29:21.920
You're free
to present the court with

29:21.922 --> 29:24.655
your expert witness,
Ms. Reagan, and both sides may

29:24.657 --> 29:26.257
produce additional
materials between now

29:26.259 --> 29:28.193
and the sentencing date,
which is set for

29:28.195 --> 29:29.427
Monday next.

29:29.429 --> 29:31.029
Until then,
this case is adjourned.

29:31.031 --> 29:31.963
Thank you, Your Honor.

29:31.965 --> 29:34.165
Thank you, Your Honor.

29:42.408 --> 29:43.774
Officer Carlson.

29:43.776 --> 29:46.444
Commissioner Reagan, sir.

29:46.446 --> 29:48.346
And Lieutenant Gormley.

29:48.348 --> 29:50.180
Please sit down.

29:55.287 --> 29:57.654
You know why we're here?

29:57.656 --> 29:59.890
Pretty sure I do,
yes, sir.

29:59.892 --> 30:01.524
Would you like a union rep?

30:01.526 --> 30:04.061
No, Lieutenant. Thank you.

30:04.063 --> 30:05.629
Do you want to speak candidly?

30:05.631 --> 30:08.565
Why else do you think
I got you here?

30:08.567 --> 30:10.933
You didn't get us here.

30:10.935 --> 30:12.435
Beg to differ, sir.

30:12.437 --> 30:14.804
You're here on account
of what started with a tip

30:14.806 --> 30:17.106
from the state's attorney
general's office, am I right?

30:17.108 --> 30:18.508
You tell me.

30:18.510 --> 30:20.810
Sir, I've been trying
for almost a year

30:20.812 --> 30:22.579
to get a sit-down with you,

30:22.581 --> 30:25.848
over what I see as the systemic
abuse of policy and power

30:25.850 --> 30:28.785
by certain precincts to violate
the rights of citizens.

30:28.787 --> 30:30.019
Name two.

30:30.021 --> 30:32.121
"Increase your activity level"
was code

30:32.123 --> 30:34.490
for get more collars
any way you can,

30:34.492 --> 30:36.058
including planting evidence.

30:36.060 --> 30:37.359
"Full enforcement" meant

30:37.361 --> 30:38.494
summons anything
that's breathing.

30:38.496 --> 30:39.796
To what end?

30:39.798 --> 30:42.231
You write up some poor kid
for an open container.

30:42.233 --> 30:44.500
He can't afford the summons,
so he doesn't show up,

30:44.502 --> 30:45.867
and you knew that going in.

30:45.869 --> 30:47.403
Right, now you've got him
in the system

30:47.405 --> 30:48.637
with a warrant out on him.

30:48.639 --> 30:50.706
You own him for whatever
you see fit to use him for.

30:50.708 --> 30:52.040
Says you.

30:52.042 --> 30:53.709
It's called
effective police work.

30:53.711 --> 30:55.177
In these neighborhoods?

30:55.179 --> 30:57.446
This isn't OshKosh B'Gosh
or wherever you're from.

30:57.448 --> 30:58.480
Planting evidence?

30:58.482 --> 31:00.115
Okay, not that, but...

31:00.117 --> 31:02.017
So, you're saying, what?

31:02.019 --> 31:04.886
At roll call, everyone knew
how to interpret?

31:04.888 --> 31:06.721
If you didn't, you were expected
to get the download

31:06.723 --> 31:08.156
from someone
who'd been around for longer.

31:08.158 --> 31:09.324
And if they didn't?

31:10.660 --> 31:13.829
You get schooled, real harsh.

31:17.033 --> 31:19.099
Say I believe you.
Boss...

31:19.101 --> 31:21.902
Sid.

31:21.904 --> 31:23.371
What's your next move?

31:23.373 --> 31:25.473
Sir?

31:25.475 --> 31:26.708
You seem like a smart guy.

31:26.710 --> 31:27.942
Certainly you didn't think

31:27.944 --> 31:30.812
that by opening
this particular can of worms,

31:30.814 --> 31:33.247
there would be
a single commanding officer

31:33.249 --> 31:35.449
who'd want you in his command.

31:35.451 --> 31:37.584
Yeah. I hadn't really thought
about it like that.

31:37.586 --> 31:39.486
Time to start.

31:39.488 --> 31:41.488
Well, I suppose I'd join
a department back home,

31:41.490 --> 31:42.890
Milwaukee or Madison.

31:42.892 --> 31:47.261
Not when they heard from me,
which they sure as hell would.

31:48.097 --> 31:50.230
Copy that.

31:52.100 --> 31:54.434
So, I'll ask you again.

31:54.436 --> 31:56.870
What's your next move?

31:56.872 --> 31:59.373
What's the right thing to do?

32:07.282 --> 32:09.548
My cell phone
and personal e-mail.

32:12.387 --> 32:15.521
I'm gonna see about
getting you out of here.

32:32.562 --> 32:35.430
Dealing drugs out of
Jimmy Quinn's? Take that back.

32:35.432 --> 32:37.198
Well, I can't take
it back; it happened.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.233
The trial's over?
Quinn's lost?

32:39.235 --> 32:40.769
No, but...
Then it's libel.

32:40.771 --> 32:42.837
They're innocent
until proven guilty.

32:42.839 --> 32:43.971
Okay.

32:43.973 --> 32:45.306
Why you taking
a stand on this, Pop?

32:45.308 --> 32:46.474
It's not a stand.

32:46.476 --> 32:48.442
Okay, what do you call it?
Cleopatra ain't

32:48.444 --> 32:49.543
the only Queen of "De Nile."

32:49.545 --> 32:50.711
Haven't heard that
one in a while.

32:50.713 --> 32:51.913
What else have you got for me?

32:51.915 --> 32:53.614
That all those
lovely Irish girls

32:53.616 --> 32:55.983
turned out to be hook...
ladies of the night?

32:55.985 --> 32:58.252
No. But as it turns out,
they're not exactly

32:58.254 --> 32:59.720
Jimmy's vestal virgins, either.

32:59.722 --> 33:00.955
Says you.

33:00.957 --> 33:03.357
Why would my dad be making
something like this up?

33:03.359 --> 33:05.191
Are you just busting his chops?

33:05.193 --> 33:07.494
No, but clearly
I've hit a nerve.

33:07.496 --> 33:08.929
Well, Pops hit on a good point.

33:08.931 --> 33:10.798
He has? What's that?
Yeah.

33:10.800 --> 33:13.033
There's a whole lot of benefit
to be had by giving

33:13.035 --> 33:15.035
the benefit of the doubt
to something you hold dear.

33:15.037 --> 33:16.637
Thank you.

33:16.639 --> 33:17.871
Big part of who you are.

33:17.873 --> 33:19.039
But what does that
have to do with Quinn's?

33:19.041 --> 33:21.107
Come on. You of all people.

33:21.109 --> 33:22.642
Me of all people what?

33:22.644 --> 33:25.011
What? You never stuck with your
convictions about something?

33:25.013 --> 33:26.679
A case? A person? A cause?

33:26.681 --> 33:27.680
Not when I'm smart.

33:27.682 --> 33:28.982
This isn't about smart.

33:28.984 --> 33:31.351
Smart's highly overrated
sometimes.

33:31.353 --> 33:32.953
I've been saying that
since fourth grade.

33:34.356 --> 33:36.189
You mean how smart's becoming
a nicer word for cynical?

33:36.191 --> 33:37.723
That's one way to put it, yeah.

33:37.725 --> 33:40.125
I mean, Pop loves Quinn's,
the Montauk Quinn's

33:40.127 --> 33:43.629
from back in the day when he
and his buddies ate and drank

33:43.631 --> 33:45.665
and drank some more
after a fishing charter.

33:45.667 --> 33:49.201
He owns that and nothing's gonna
change that, nor should it.

33:49.203 --> 33:51.771
And if the place is changing,
I don't want to hear about it.

33:51.773 --> 33:54.506
It's staying the same to me,
and that's my right.

33:54.508 --> 33:55.674
End of story.

33:55.676 --> 33:57.109
And you don't have anything
in your life

33:57.111 --> 34:00.412
that you would defend against
all comers to the bitter end?

34:00.414 --> 34:01.981
Well, not a restaurant.

34:01.983 --> 34:03.782
Well, no. That's Pop's in this.
What's yours?

34:04.952 --> 34:06.585
Just about any underdog.

34:06.587 --> 34:07.819
Well, there you go.

34:07.821 --> 34:08.887
What about you, Danny?

34:08.889 --> 34:11.456
Misunderstood teenage boys.

34:11.458 --> 34:14.092
Once you've been one, you can't
help but feel for them all.

34:14.094 --> 34:16.327
Except for these
two, of course.

34:16.329 --> 34:17.696
Thanks, Dad.

34:17.697 --> 34:18.630
Jamie?

34:18.632 --> 34:20.197
Pit bulls.

34:20.199 --> 34:21.600
They're like
ex-boxers in a bar.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.234
Everyone taunts them

34:23.235 --> 34:24.870
and then acts shocked
when they punch back.

34:24.871 --> 34:27.938
Always think
they get a raw deal.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.273
Plus, they're adorable.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.875
So sweet.

34:30.877 --> 34:32.210
Well, I know what
you're getting for Christmas.

34:32.212 --> 34:33.342
What about you, Dad?

34:33.344 --> 34:34.777
What do you end up being
the last man defending?

34:34.779 --> 34:38.215
What comes to mind right now?

34:38.217 --> 34:40.016
Set-in-their-ways old cops.

34:40.018 --> 34:41.784
I can't help but root for 'em,

34:41.786 --> 34:45.322
even though I know
it might come back to bite me.

34:45.324 --> 34:47.790
You talking about Pops or Danny?

35:03.307 --> 35:04.908
Derrick!

35:15.386 --> 35:17.486
Hey.

35:17.488 --> 35:19.255
Thanks.

35:21.259 --> 35:23.926
You wanted to talk, so talk.

35:28.666 --> 35:32.200
I...I got a visit
from the cops.

35:33.070 --> 35:34.436
About Rebecca?

35:34.438 --> 35:36.504
What do you think?

35:36.506 --> 35:38.607
I think, "So what?"

35:38.609 --> 35:40.708
You know, the chick you were
banging got hit by a car.

35:40.710 --> 35:43.044
What's there
to say, but...

35:43.046 --> 35:45.146
It-it's sad, it-it's so sad.

35:45.148 --> 35:47.949
And she got hit by a car
with a snootful of blow

35:47.951 --> 35:49.016
cut with W-18.

35:49.018 --> 35:51.286
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:51.288 --> 35:52.920
Come on, you-you want
to tell me why?

35:52.922 --> 35:54.456
What, you think I had
something to do with it?

35:54.458 --> 35:56.557
Yeah, I know you did.

35:56.559 --> 35:59.060
I don't have
the whole market on W-18.

35:59.062 --> 36:02.997
Yeah, you do in that little
world she moves around in.

36:03.833 --> 36:06.400
Prove it.

36:09.772 --> 36:11.271
Hey, hey, hey, man.

36:11.273 --> 36:12.606
Listen, take it easy.

36:12.608 --> 36:13.189
Why?!

36:13.213 --> 36:14.109
Let's not get carried
away, all right?

36:14.110 --> 36:15.875
What did she do to you?!

36:15.877 --> 36:17.877
Calm down.

36:17.879 --> 36:19.146
You want to talk?

36:19.148 --> 36:21.681
Let's talk.

36:21.683 --> 36:22.749
Come on.

36:22.751 --> 36:24.884
Don't be holding a gun on me.

36:24.886 --> 36:27.287
Come on, let's
put that away.

36:34.295 --> 36:35.662
She was gonna go

36:35.664 --> 36:38.564
to old man Quinn, and where do
you think he was gonna go next?

36:38.566 --> 36:39.899
To the cops.

36:39.901 --> 36:41.367
You don't know that!

36:41.369 --> 36:43.770
You started this! Telling her.

36:43.772 --> 36:45.971
You really think I was gonna let
some little Irish piece of tail

36:45.973 --> 36:47.406
come between
everything we built?

36:47.408 --> 36:49.008
You ought to be thanking me,
dumb-ass.

36:56.184 --> 36:57.483
Police!

36:57.485 --> 36:59.118
Drop it! Drop it!

36:59.120 --> 36:59.818
Drop it!

36:59.820 --> 37:00.919
Drop the gun!

37:00.921 --> 37:03.522
Turn around, get up
against the car. Move!

37:04.458 --> 37:07.459
Derrick Sanders,
you're under arrest...

37:07.461 --> 37:09.662
for the murder of Rebecca Collins.

37:09.664 --> 37:11.329
For being dumb enough

37:11.331 --> 37:14.667
to fall for a starter's
pistol, you jackass.

37:15.870 --> 37:17.502
Good job.

37:18.372 --> 37:19.704
Come on.

37:20.641 --> 37:22.840
You okay?
Yeah.

37:34.521 --> 37:36.054
Ms. Reagan.

37:36.756 --> 37:38.489
I want to thank you.

37:38.491 --> 37:41.693
Well, don't thank me; the judge
hasn't handed down a sentence.

37:41.695 --> 37:43.661
Not for the result.

37:43.663 --> 37:46.297
For the grace you've shown.

37:49.468 --> 37:51.768
All rise.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.217
I've reviewed the expert
testimony as provided

38:06.219 --> 38:09.986
by the D.A.'s office, and I've
found the evidence convincing

38:09.988 --> 38:11.554
that Ms. Duncan lacked
both control

38:11.556 --> 38:13.724
and awareness
of her actions.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.126
However...

38:16.128 --> 38:18.361
in her lucid moments,
Ms. Duncan failed to report

38:18.363 --> 38:20.697
her activities
to the appropriate authorities,

38:20.699 --> 38:22.165
or to seek help.

38:22.167 --> 38:24.267
In those moments,
she had responsibility

38:24.269 --> 38:26.102
that she failed to act upon.

38:26.104 --> 38:27.870
As such, I hereby sentence
Ms. Duncan

38:27.872 --> 38:29.171
to the maximum sentence allowed

38:29.173 --> 38:32.642
under her plea deal,
six years in state prison.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.678
This court is adjourned.

39:05.542 --> 39:07.276
It's one thing
to take an officer aside

39:07.278 --> 39:08.356
and give him a talking to.

39:08.357 --> 39:10.357
Again, boss, I didn't sign up
for a lecture from...

39:10.359 --> 39:11.075
Humor me, Captain.

39:11.099 --> 39:12.593
Even though it's
about a corrupt practice...

39:12.594 --> 39:13.660
You say corrupt,
some people say...

39:13.662 --> 39:14.994
Sid, please.
No. I should go.

39:14.996 --> 39:16.496
I don't want to listen
to this, sit here and...

39:16.498 --> 39:18.565
You can and will.

39:20.234 --> 39:22.435
Move it along.

39:22.437 --> 39:25.605
It's a whole other thing
to plan it out,

39:25.607 --> 39:28.007
so that you confront an officer
in the locker room,

39:28.009 --> 39:29.408
in front of his fellow officers,

39:29.410 --> 39:32.011
timed so that he's standing
at attention in his underwear

39:32.013 --> 39:33.446
while you tear him a new one.

39:33.448 --> 39:35.281
You're making this sound like
it happens every day.

39:35.283 --> 39:36.748
Yeah, I've seen it
happen often enough that

39:36.750 --> 39:37.783
I asked around-- it's a thing.

39:37.785 --> 39:38.851
You get one of your boyos
to tip you off.

39:38.853 --> 39:39.918
Okay, I call BS.

39:39.920 --> 39:42.388
I must have witnessed it
over a dozen times.

39:43.224 --> 39:45.124
All right. So what?

39:45.126 --> 39:48.026
My high school football coach
used to do the same thing,

39:48.028 --> 39:50.061
and we won state
three years running.

39:50.063 --> 39:51.229
Okay, well,
that's not gonna help.

39:51.231 --> 39:52.898
These are men and women.
They're not kids.

39:52.900 --> 39:55.901
They're professionals, and they
deserve to be treated as such.

39:55.903 --> 39:58.704
And this ain't the Candy Land
Police Department, either.

39:58.706 --> 40:00.472
I know that.

40:00.474 --> 40:02.541
But that kind of bullying...

40:02.543 --> 40:04.642
You toss your better judgment,
your right to question,

40:04.644 --> 40:06.277
just to avoid
going through it again,

40:06.279 --> 40:08.113
and that doesn't
make for good cops.

40:08.115 --> 40:09.381
Right, that makes for

40:09.383 --> 40:11.082
go along
to get along boyos.

40:11.084 --> 40:14.552
Do you have any evidence
that Captain Gibson

40:14.554 --> 40:17.889
ordered or condoned,
implicitly or otherwise,

40:17.891 --> 40:22.459
the planting of evidence to
justify a collar or make a case?

40:22.461 --> 40:24.495
Not hard evidence.

40:24.497 --> 40:26.096
Rumors and hearsay.

40:26.098 --> 40:27.031
Never happened.

40:27.033 --> 40:29.600
Look, say I believe you...

40:29.602 --> 40:31.201
Say I don't give a rat's ass
what you believe.

40:31.203 --> 40:32.269
Called an olive branch, Ward.

40:32.271 --> 40:33.237
Screw him!

40:33.239 --> 40:36.373
You are refuting
everything he said?

40:37.209 --> 40:39.809
Think, Ward.

40:41.547 --> 40:43.980
You take away stop and frisk,
you take away

40:43.982 --> 40:47.251
an officer's sixth sense, 'cause
it's now called profiling,

40:47.253 --> 40:49.386
which is what happened
on my watch.

40:49.388 --> 40:50.354
Easy there, you...

40:50.356 --> 40:52.322
No, he's got a point.

40:52.324 --> 40:56.492
So, yeah, they've taken away
some of the tools from the box.

40:56.494 --> 40:58.094
So you look for new tools.

40:58.096 --> 41:00.329
You get creative with
the ones you have left

41:00.331 --> 41:02.498
because the job's the same.

41:04.402 --> 41:06.803
And the bad guys
aren't gonna give you a break

41:06.805 --> 41:09.672
because you've got
your hand tied, okay?

41:12.510 --> 41:14.310
You hear him?

41:16.114 --> 41:18.013
Yes, sir.

41:18.015 --> 41:20.683
You want to stay on the job?

41:20.685 --> 41:21.817
Ask me some other time.

41:21.819 --> 41:24.320
I'm asking you now.

41:25.156 --> 41:27.255
Yes, sir.

41:27.257 --> 41:30.793
'Cause you're gonna be working
with more guys like him.

41:30.795 --> 41:33.562
Guys who don't pine for the good
old days, 'cause they weren't

41:33.564 --> 41:34.496
there for 'em.

41:34.498 --> 41:35.798
Men and women who want

41:35.800 --> 41:38.467
to do the job
and play by the rules.

41:38.469 --> 41:40.669
2016 rules.

41:42.539 --> 41:44.672
Like it or not.

41:44.674 --> 41:46.674
Yes, sir.

41:51.047 --> 41:53.148
Good.

41:53.150 --> 41:57.819
I want you two to ride back
to your precinct... together.

42:01.524 --> 42:05.159
And go back to work, together.

42:09.330 --> 42:10.829
Dismissed.
