I can see there's music

00:19.645 --> 00:21.480
and love in the air.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.357
How's the tour going?

00:23.357 --> 00:25.776
Uh, well, um, let's see.

00:25.776 --> 00:28.070
I'm back with my man.
- Me!

00:29.363 --> 00:32.698
And tomorrow night,
we play a sold-out show on Long Island.

00:32.698 --> 00:35.702
So, I'd say it's going pretty good.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.580
Uh, you think?

00:38.580 --> 00:40.207
Aren't they adorable?

00:40.207 --> 00:42.668
You can catch them
tomorrow night in Massapequa.

00:42.668 --> 00:44.169
You can catch me,

00:44.169 --> 00:46.421
Sandy Rivers, on the entertainment beat.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.925
Demoted because of some
unproven accusations,

00:49.925 --> 00:53.095
which, even if true, would be
perfectly legal in the states

00:53.095 --> 00:56.390
in which the alleged incidents took place.

00:58.851 --> 01:00.269
That's my brother.

01:00.269 --> 01:01.937
That's my brother in there!

01:01.937 --> 01:05.357
Can you believe I was in his first band,
Sunny D and the Crazy Straw?

01:05.357 --> 01:07.192
And guess who the Crazy Straw was?

01:07.192 --> 01:09.361
Me! I was the straw.

01:09.361 --> 01:11.655
Ellen, I know that you're excited,
but what we just watched

01:11.655 --> 01:13.448
was very painful for someone in this room.

01:13.448 --> 01:16.034
Oh, thanks, but I'm fine. I've moved on.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.787
What? No. We all know that
you can toggle breezily through gentlemen.

01:18.787 --> 01:19.830
I meant Sid.

01:20.873 --> 01:23.876
I'm fine, too! Jesse and I are fighting,
but we'll get through it.

01:23.876 --> 01:27.504
We're like boyzzz.
That's "boys" with three Z's.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.214
If it was two Z's, I'd be worried.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.216
Uh, Soph?

01:31.216 --> 01:32.843
Why is my mom texting you?

01:32.843 --> 01:34.720
Oh, because we're visiting
your parents tomorrow

01:34.720 --> 01:35.888
before Jesse's show.

01:35.888 --> 01:37.890
What? How do I not know this?

01:37.890 --> 01:39.850
'Cause you're not on the group chat.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.269
It's called "Text Appeal."
Your dad made it up.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.647
He could legit do stand-up!

01:46.064 --> 01:48.108
I was crazy about Val's parents.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.695
They were sweet, funny,
madly in love, and hot.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.739
Oh, really, really hot.

01:53.739 --> 01:57.284
They went from
King and Queen of Massapequa High

01:57.284 --> 02:00.829
to King and Queen
of Long Island Real Estate.

02:00.829 --> 02:03.832
But it wasn't so easy
being their daughter.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.668
They found love quickly,

02:06.668 --> 02:08.545
and they wanted Val to do the same.

02:08.545 --> 02:11.423
<i>So they tried to find it for her.</i>

02:11.423 --> 02:12.591
<i>Over...</i>

02:14.885 --> 02:16.178
<i>...and over...</i>

02:18.347 --> 02:19.515
<i>...and over.</i>

02:21.475 --> 02:24.478
No setups this time, they promised.
But we should get home

02:24.478 --> 02:27.105
because I wanna exfoliate
before I see your parents tomorrow.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.566
One time, they were like,
"Sophie, you're glowing."

02:29.566 --> 02:30.984
And I want that to happen again.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.654
Yeah, we should get going, too.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.447
Stay strong, Sid.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.699
Mwah! You'll get through this.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.494
I'll never turn down a head kiss,
but I am fine.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.995
Enjoy the concert.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.669
Okay! Alone.

02:49.419 --> 02:50.420
No big deal.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.298
Is it weird that I'm talking to myself?

02:53.966 --> 02:55.008
<i>Boom!</i>

02:55.008 --> 02:56.844
<i>Now, I'm being normal.</i>

02:57.678 --> 02:59.555
<i>Yeah, I'm being normal as hell right now.</i>

02:59.930 --> 03:01.598
<i>Are you?</i>

03:01.598 --> 03:03.600
<i>Nah, j-just messing with you, bro.</i>

03:07.729 --> 03:10.274
This is so cool!

03:10.274 --> 03:12.484
I've never been in a green room before.

03:12.484 --> 03:15.112
Where do you think they came up
with the term "green room"?

03:15.112 --> 03:17.364
I mean, I don't see anything... Hey!

03:17.364 --> 03:19.241
You're in a conversation. Act like it.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.492
Sorry.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.494
I have devised a brilliant plan

03:22.494 --> 03:25.038
to reunite Sid and Jesse
and save their friendship.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.541
The last time you devised
a brilliant plan, you killed our fish.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.043
- Herman died for science!
- You tickling him is not science!

03:30.043 --> 03:31.461
We know that now!

03:31.461 --> 03:33.463
Ch-- Charlie. It's worth asking.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.465
Are you a little less smart
than you think you are?

03:36.341 --> 03:38.260
It's okay!
I'm dumber than I think, too!

03:38.260 --> 03:39.928
Hey! Hey, hey! You made it.
How cool is this?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.388
Um, so cool.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.432
Oh, hey, you see this giant wine glass
full of Sun Chips?

03:43.432 --> 03:46.101
Those are for me. I requested them.

03:46.101 --> 03:48.645
Not the wine glass.
That was all Larry, our catering guy.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.315
He, uh, is all about whimsy.
Loves an unconventional vessel.

03:51.315 --> 03:53.692
Oh, you're right. Look at that fedora
full of chicken fingers.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.444
- Exactly.
- Hi.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.154
- Hey!
- Hi.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.281
One more post for social media. Sorry.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.116
Promise, this is the last one of the day.

04:01.116 --> 04:02.242
No.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.787
I'm sorry. I promise this is
one of the last ones of the day?

04:05.787 --> 04:07.039
No.

04:07.039 --> 04:08.290
Sorry.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.293
Be right back. Don't judge.

04:11.293 --> 04:12.419
Judge what?

04:12.419 --> 04:14.671
Candid kiss, take one.

04:18.175 --> 04:21.553
- Oh, my God! Get that thing outta here!
- Whoa!

04:21.553 --> 04:24.932
Whoa! Just let us be us.
Artists and songwriters.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.476
- Got it.
- Thanks, babe.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.478
Yikes.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.651
Wow. Larry!

04:36.318 --> 04:38.070
You whimsical bitch.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.699
No one could sell that house.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.786
But, when the Polinskys heard us
talking about a mystery bidder,

04:45.786 --> 04:47.746
they gave us 20 over asking.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.540
Oh! Who's the mystery bidder?

04:49.540 --> 04:53.043
There wasn't one.
They lied, because they're liars.

04:53.043 --> 04:56.213
You call it a lie.
I call it a truth zhuzh.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.756
I'd like to zhuzh you right now.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.928
- Stop it.
- Oh, you guys are so bad!

05:02.928 --> 05:06.014
It's true. We're bad.
Th-that's true about us.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.351
Who's that?

05:09.351 --> 05:11.144
You're setting me up! I hate you!

05:11.144 --> 05:13.647
- We're not setting you up.
- We're setting Sophie up.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.733
- What?!
- Wha...

05:16.733 --> 05:19.736
- Wait till Oscar sees you.
- You are glowing.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.739
Oh, my God.
I didn't even, like, do anything.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.373
Rank your top 10
worst meals you've ever had.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.334
<i>Sid, I have to assist
a surgery this afternoon,</i>

05:34.334 --> 05:37.171
<i>and if I don't get a little more sleep,
I might Dr. Death someone.</i>

05:37.171 --> 05:39.006
Yeah, that sounds so stressful.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.507
What are some of the mistakes
you might make?

05:40.507 --> 05:41.550
Just give me a quick top five.

05:41.550 --> 05:44.052
<i>Oh, my God,
you can be alone for one day, alright?</i>

05:44.052 --> 05:46.430
<i>I believe in you. I love you. Mwah!</i>

05:51.935 --> 05:54.104
SID [thinking]:
<i>Okay. One day alone.</i>

05:54.104 --> 05:57.649
<i>Or maybe tons
now that Jesse's famous and hates you.</i>

05:58.442 --> 06:00.527
<i>Relax. You are fine.</i>

06:00.527 --> 06:01.778
<i>You don't need Jesse.</i>

06:01.778 --> 06:03.197
Jesse?!

06:08.410 --> 06:10.913
Cookies.
- That's what I think they are, too.

06:12.456 --> 06:15.709
"I'm sorry for everything,
please come to my show, J."

06:16.877 --> 06:18.670
Did the guy who ordered this
sound British?

06:18.670 --> 06:20.047
Yeah. Upper crust, for sure.

06:20.047 --> 06:20.714
Huh?

06:21.340 --> 06:22.758
I'm on season four of <i>The Crown.</i>

06:22.758 --> 06:23.884
Right.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.803
You see, my friend is upset
that I'm in a little fight

06:26.803 --> 06:28.430
with my other friend,
but it's gonna be okay.

06:28.430 --> 06:30.015
He just needs some time.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.600
- Okay...
- The point is, like,

06:31.600 --> 06:33.101
I'm not lonely.
- Okay.

06:34.478 --> 06:37.356
So you own an escrow company?

06:37.356 --> 06:38.815
I love escrow.

06:39.191 --> 06:42.402
I'll give you $1 million
if you could tell me what it is.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.947
Escrow is...

06:46.657 --> 06:47.908
Siri, what's escrow?

06:47.908 --> 06:50.536
Hey, I can hear you!
No, you can't!

06:51.912 --> 06:55.332
So, what made you wanna
set Oscar up with Sophie?

06:55.332 --> 06:57.668
Oh, he's just really, really special,

06:57.668 --> 06:59.253
and we didn't want him to go to waste.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.922
And setting him up with me
would have been a waste?

07:01.922 --> 07:04.383
You told us that you didn't
want us setting you up anymore.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.968
What, so we're listening to me now?

07:05.968 --> 07:08.512
We've accepted that you're
not the relationship type.

07:09.054 --> 07:12.516
I mean, you're 30, and you've
only had one serious boyfriend.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.184
If that.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.602
Wait, what?

07:16.186 --> 07:19.565
We have questions about this "Charlie."

07:20.315 --> 07:24.111
An "aristocrat" who
"left his life in London" for you?

07:24.111 --> 07:26.780
Oh, my God!
Do you guys not think he's real?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.323
Course we think he's "real."

07:29.491 --> 07:30.701
I showed you a picture of him.

07:30.701 --> 07:34.079
You showed us a picture of... a person.

07:39.418 --> 07:40.878
<i>Oscar...</i>

07:40.878 --> 07:42.004
<i>Oye.</i>

07:42.963 --> 07:44.381
<i>¿Quieres ver mi cuarto?</i>

07:45.340 --> 07:47.259
I'm sorry, Val.
Do you care to repeat

07:47.259 --> 07:50.512
that sexy-sounding phrase
just a little more slowly?

07:51.096 --> 07:52.639
Siri, translate this.

07:54.183 --> 07:55.976
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.479
So, we've commissioned
some new visuals

07:59.479 --> 08:00.981
for when you perform <i>Jay Street.</i>

08:00.981 --> 08:02.232
Okay.

08:02.232 --> 08:06.236
MEREDITH [singing]:
<i>♪ I should have gotten off
the train at Jay Street ♪</i>

08:06.236 --> 08:07.863
<i>♪ 'Cause I wanna be... ♪</i>

08:07.863 --> 08:09.823
W-where did you get this stuff?

08:09.823 --> 08:12.201
From me.
Look how cute we are.

08:12.201 --> 08:14.328
<i>♪ ...I can hear your heartbeat ♪</i>

08:14.328 --> 08:16.038
<i>♪ Then I realize ♪</i>

08:16.038 --> 08:19.333
<i>♪ I'm just missing Jay Street ♪</i>

08:21.043 --> 08:23.629
Wow!
A-a-and that's in there, too, huh?

08:23.629 --> 08:25.088
Good to go?

08:25.088 --> 08:26.965
- Actually--
- Oh, we love it--

08:26.965 --> 08:28.967
Oh, I'm sorry, Jesse,
did you have a quick thought?

08:30.385 --> 08:32.846
No. Uh, no. Forget it.

08:34.223 --> 08:35.224
Thanks.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.397
- This is bad.
- Indeed.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.150
But on the bright side,
my plan has entered phase three.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.402
I need some hat chicken.

08:49.363 --> 08:52.533
And hip, hip, hip,

08:52.533 --> 08:55.494
hip... pow.

08:56.954 --> 08:59.748
Well, Val,
very cool of you to show us

08:59.748 --> 09:01.291
that new dance move
you just came up with.

09:02.835 --> 09:04.294
Can we talk for a second?

09:04.294 --> 09:05.504
What are you doing?

09:05.504 --> 09:09.049
We don't hit on each other's dates!
It's in the Ride or Die handbook.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.884
First off, there's no actual handbook.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.095
Uh, there will be as soon as
I get a ride to Kinkos.

09:13.846 --> 09:15.180
And this doesn't count.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.266
He's only your date
because of my insane parents.

09:17.266 --> 09:19.935
Your parents aren't insane!
They're amazing!

09:19.935 --> 09:21.728
You are lucky to have parents

09:21.728 --> 09:23.397
that even care about who you date.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.607
The closest my mom ever came
to setting me up

09:25.607 --> 09:28.318
was when she taped her weed to my thigh
on the way to LaGuardia.

09:28.694 --> 09:31.989
If you love them so much,
why don't you just ask them to adopt you?

09:31.989 --> 09:34.408
I have looked into it, and I'm too old.

09:37.119 --> 09:40.163
Look, I'm sorry, but I have
to prove to my parents

09:40.163 --> 09:41.665
that I'm good enough for Oscar.

09:41.665 --> 09:45.460
So you're gonna steal the first guy
that I felt a spark with since Jesse?

09:46.003 --> 09:48.046
Yeah. That's what I'm gonna do.

09:56.555 --> 09:58.348
So, that <i>Jay Street</i> video...

10:00.142 --> 10:02.311
I could have sworn I saw
the most painful moment

10:02.311 --> 10:04.563
in your life in there.
Are we loving that?

10:04.563 --> 10:06.023
No, we're not.

10:06.023 --> 10:07.149
Did you tell Meredith?

10:07.149 --> 10:09.526
I-I-I can't.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.777
She's got enough on her plate,

10:10.777 --> 10:13.030
and I don't wanna bother her
with my... stuff.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.865
A-and by stuff, you mean your feelings?

10:14.865 --> 10:16.533
Yes.

10:17.034 --> 10:19.494
Hey, remember that band
we had when we were little?

10:19.494 --> 10:21.288
Sunny D and the Crazy Straw?

10:21.288 --> 10:23.665
Yeah. How could I forget?
Nobody harmonized like you did.

10:23.665 --> 10:24.499
I know.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.627
BOTH [harmonizing]:
<i>Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh ♪</i>

10:26.627 --> 10:28.962
- Hoo. Still got it. Mm-hmm.
- Still got it.

10:29.505 --> 10:31.423
You know what my
favorite song you wrote was?

10:31.423 --> 10:32.925
<i>Jesse's A Boy's Name, Too?</i>

10:34.176 --> 10:35.219
<i>Mega Amazing Lady.</i>

10:35.928 --> 10:36.970
I don't remember that one.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.931
You wrote it when you had
that crazy crush

10:38.931 --> 10:40.766
on Molly Marcus. Uh...

10:41.475 --> 10:43.769
<i>♪ You make my life a silly dance ♪</i>

10:43.769 --> 10:46.063
<i>♪ You make me fine with wearing pants ♪</i>

10:46.063 --> 10:47.856
<i>♪ I'll marry you in Paris, France ♪</i>

10:47.856 --> 10:49.566
<i>♪ A mega amazing lady ♪</i>

10:49.566 --> 10:50.943
- That song was about Mom.
- Ew!

10:50.943 --> 10:52.819
- Yeah.
- Not Molly Marcus?

10:52.819 --> 10:55.614
No, that was just
a straight-up love song

10:55.614 --> 10:56.907
about marrying our mother in Paris.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.659
- Why Paris?
- She loves Paris.

10:58.659 --> 11:01.161
- Okay, pushing past that.
- Yes.

11:03.121 --> 11:06.708
You deserve someone
who makes your life a silly dance.

11:07.376 --> 11:10.629
And maybe Meredith's that person,

11:10.629 --> 11:12.381
or maybe she's not.

11:12.381 --> 11:14.049
But, the only way to know for sure

11:14.049 --> 11:17.010
is to tell her how you feel
and see what she does.

11:20.389 --> 11:21.849
Yeah, you're right.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.603
So, I hear you're the man
who can get me a house.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.689
Oh. Are you looking to buy?

11:28.689 --> 11:30.941
No, I'm broke. I'm looking to squat.

11:30.941 --> 11:32.568
I'm good at it. Wanna see?

11:36.071 --> 11:37.906
Oh, sorry. We, uh,

11:37.906 --> 11:40.659
just sold a three-plus-two
in Great Neck, so we're making out.

11:40.659 --> 11:43.203
Oh, yeah, I get it.
I don't know what a three-plus-two is,

11:43.203 --> 11:44.580
but I'd make out with either one of you.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.081
- We know.
- You made that clear.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.793
Wait. Why aren't you with Oscar?

11:49.793 --> 11:53.255
Because of little miss
"Hips, Hips, Hips, Pow"!

11:53.797 --> 11:57.009
She doesn't even like him.
She just doesn't like that he likes me.

11:58.135 --> 12:00.304
You know what?
This is not Val's decision.

12:00.304 --> 12:01.930
This is Sophie's choice.

12:04.308 --> 12:06.310
- I don't think she knows the reference.
- No.

12:07.186 --> 12:09.438
You can't just take
whatever you want from me!

12:09.438 --> 12:12.107
You know, I can't believe I ever
thought that you were my "ride or die."

12:12.107 --> 12:15.194
"I can't believe I ever
thought that you were my ride or die!"

12:15.194 --> 12:17.112
That's it. You know, I'm done.

12:17.112 --> 12:18.947
If this is the kind of friend
that you are,

12:18.947 --> 12:20.240
then get outta my life!

12:20.240 --> 12:23.327
Bitch, you don't have a life.
How can I get out of it?

12:23.327 --> 12:24.494
- Girls, please--
- That's it.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.872
You know what? You have two weeks
to get out of my apartment.

12:26.872 --> 12:29.458
Screw ride or die. I choose die!

12:30.667 --> 12:32.544
- Okay! Okay! Everyone, stop! Stop!
- Stop.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.004
Alright.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.714
This is all our fault.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.758
W-we set Oscar up with Sophie

12:37.758 --> 12:40.636
because we knew you would get
jealous and want him for yourself.

12:40.636 --> 12:42.429
But we never meant
to destroy your friendship.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.765
Don't worry.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.808
You didn't. We were acting.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.603
And our performances were...

12:50.145 --> 12:53.232
I-I thought we were gonna say
"Oscar-worthy" at the same time.

12:53.232 --> 12:55.859
I know, but you tagged me
pretty good here.

12:55.859 --> 12:56.985
Oh, my God, Sophie!

12:56.985 --> 12:59.321
I'm so sorry!
- Hold on. What's happening?

12:59.321 --> 13:01.031
SOPHIE'S SON [on phone]:
<i>Yeah, what is happening?</i>

13:01.573 --> 13:04.326
I told you about our talk
in Val's bedroom,

13:04.326 --> 13:06.620
but I didn't tell you about all of it.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.580
I'm playing with structure here.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.749
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.299
I don't know what I'm saying.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.011
I would never choose a guy over you.

13:23.762 --> 13:26.598
God, my parents just know
how to get under my skin, and--

13:27.182 --> 13:30.060
Oh, my God!

13:30.060 --> 13:32.813
They're doing me
like they did the Polinskys!

13:32.813 --> 13:34.731
They knew I wouldn't go for Oscar,

13:34.731 --> 13:37.150
so they created a competitive situation!

13:38.485 --> 13:39.903
Those beautiful bastards.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.532
So, you faked a fight to get back at us?

13:43.532 --> 13:45.993
Hell yeah, we did.
You can't just mess with us that way.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.327
Uh--

13:47.327 --> 13:50.289
Oh, Oscar, I am so sorry.
You must be so confused.

13:50.289 --> 13:51.999
Not really.

13:51.999 --> 13:55.460
And then I'll say,
"Screw ride or die! I choose die!"

13:55.460 --> 13:57.546
A-and then,
you should punch her in the stomach.

13:57.546 --> 13:59.339
- Yes!
- Yeah.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.967
But not really, though, right?
- We'll figure it out.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.386
<i>Et tu,</i> Oscar?

14:04.386 --> 14:06.388
After all the escrows we've given you.

14:06.388 --> 14:09.391
I'm sorry, guys.
Congrats on Great Neck, by the way.

14:10.809 --> 14:12.436
That was fun.

14:12.436 --> 14:15.355
Weird, but fun. I'll call you?

14:15.355 --> 14:17.941
Awesome.
You mean text me, right?

14:17.941 --> 14:19.109
Yeah. I'm not one of those.

14:19.109 --> 14:21.195
Oh! [laughs] Thank God.

14:21.195 --> 14:23.322
Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

14:26.325 --> 14:28.285
Hey! It's me, Jesse.

14:28.285 --> 14:31.914
From the relationship!
- Oh, Jesse! I've heard of you. What's up?

14:31.914 --> 14:34.625
Uh, it-it's about that video.

14:34.625 --> 14:38.420
Um, is there any way that we could maybe
not play it during the show?

14:39.046 --> 14:41.590
It's just there's real stuff in there.
Stuff that was...

14:41.590 --> 14:42.841
hard for me to live through.

14:42.841 --> 14:45.511
I know, it's real. That's what
makes it resonate with my fans.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.389
Okay, uh, I know, b-but look, um...

14:51.225 --> 14:52.935
Hey.

14:52.935 --> 14:55.646
I've put up with the weird interviews
and the posed kisses,

14:55.646 --> 14:58.023
a-and I put up with Trina dropping hints

14:58.023 --> 15:01.235
that I'm "too tall," which, I mean,
what am I supposed to do, get surgery?

15:01.235 --> 15:04.071
And who's gonna pay for that?
You know what? That's not the point.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.573
If you wanna keep the rest, that's fine.
Just not the proposal.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.575
I-I-I don't want the most
painful moment of my life

15:08.575 --> 15:10.661
to be publicized. Again.

15:10.661 --> 15:12.704
Jesse...

15:12.704 --> 15:14.706
<i>Jay Street</i> is my biggest song.

15:14.706 --> 15:15.541
Right.

15:15.541 --> 15:19.044
And the proposal is what makes it work.

15:20.170 --> 15:23.173
It's gotta stay. You'll get used to it.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.593
Just like I got used to
these magnetic eyelashes.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.513
They gave you temporary blindness.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.390
Exactly.

15:31.390 --> 15:32.724
Temporary.

15:40.566 --> 15:41.900
I feel terrible.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.194
We should never have
used you like that, Sophie.

15:44.194 --> 15:46.071
Oh, thanks.

15:46.071 --> 15:48.365
But, I'm not the one
you should be apologizing to.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.366
Oh, you're right.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.660
I'm sorry I led you down
that path, my love.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.454
No! I meant Val!

15:54.454 --> 15:56.331
Apologize to Val!

15:56.331 --> 15:57.624
We were just trying to help her.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.127
I mean, she's so lonely,
she's making up boyfriends.

16:00.586 --> 16:03.881
They think I made up "Charlie."
Now I'm doing it.

16:05.048 --> 16:06.884
What? Guys!

16:08.135 --> 16:11.430
Listen, we all want to meet
the love of our life at 16,

16:11.430 --> 16:14.683
but the world is just not
that simple anymore.

16:14.683 --> 16:16.643
She's right. Life is hard.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.645
Which is why we hate that
you have to do it on your own.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.273
I mean, your mother and I have
had each other our entire lives.

16:21.273 --> 16:24.443
We've shared the same outgoing message
since the '80s.

16:24.443 --> 16:25.652
Guys!

16:25.652 --> 16:28.572
Look, don't get me wrong.
What you two have is awesome.

16:28.572 --> 16:30.908
And maybe one day, I'll find that, too.

16:30.908 --> 16:34.328
Maybe I already found it,
and I have to find my way back to it.

16:34.328 --> 16:38.123
But, either way, for now, I'm good.

16:38.749 --> 16:40.751
- Okay. Mm.
- She's so strong.

16:40.751 --> 16:43.795
Look, if it makes you two dorks
feel better, I'm not alone.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.923
Oh, yeah? She hooks up all the time.

16:45.923 --> 16:48.717
The other day,
she took down a literal giant.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.678
Oh. Oh, you mean me?

16:51.678 --> 16:53.555
Aw!

16:54.973 --> 16:58.268
Like a-a New York Giant
or an actual giant?

16:58.268 --> 17:00.270
Whatever helps you sleep, my love.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.983
- Have you seen Jesse?
- Uh, no,

17:04.983 --> 17:08.654
but I imagine he's probably backstage
reuniting with Sid.

17:08.654 --> 17:09.988
Charles, God knows I love you,

17:09.988 --> 17:11.615
but I don't think your
little plan's gonna do it.

17:11.615 --> 17:14.284
Hm. You think me such a fool.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.453
Sweet, naive Eleanor.

17:16.453 --> 17:17.913
Not Eleanor. Just Ellen.

17:17.913 --> 17:19.998
- Is it really? How drab.
- Mm-hmm.

17:21.333 --> 17:24.795
Okay, so first,
I sent Sid cookies from Jesse.

17:25.337 --> 17:27.297
<i>And what, my dear girl,</i>

17:27.297 --> 17:30.133
<i>does one tend to consume with cookies?</i>

17:30.133 --> 17:32.761
<i>Milk?
Precisely.</i>

17:32.761 --> 17:35.681
<i>But the target struggles
to digest dairy products.</i>

17:35.681 --> 17:38.475
<i>So he heads straight to
the bathroom for his Lactaid pills.</i>

17:39.017 --> 17:40.269
<i>The only problem?</i>

17:40.269 --> 17:44.189
I took them to lead him on
to the next phase of my trap.

17:45.148 --> 17:46.525
I also took his vape pen.

17:46.525 --> 17:48.861
Was not part of the plan.
It's just a nasty habit.

17:49.444 --> 17:51.363
<i>Sid's desire for more Lactaid</i>

17:51.363 --> 17:53.824
<i>leads him to the bodega downstairs.</i>

17:53.824 --> 17:56.493
<i>While in line,
he sees a vibrant male friendship</i>

17:56.493 --> 17:58.120
<i>played by Trevor and Amit,</i>

17:58.120 --> 18:01.290
<i>my friends from abs class who agreed
to perform solely for the attention.</i>

18:02.457 --> 18:05.502
<i>Their depiction of male revelry
will make Sid ache for his Jesse,</i>

18:05.502 --> 18:08.672
<i>and send him straight here to Massapequa.</i>

18:09.423 --> 18:10.632
You're sharper than I thought!

18:10.632 --> 18:14.511
Indeed, my dear Eleanor. Sorry.
Just Ellen. Yeah, again, sharp.

18:15.554 --> 18:18.056
And look who's here right on time...

18:18.056 --> 18:19.141
Oh, it's you two.

18:21.810 --> 18:25.230
MEREDITH [over speaker]:
<i>Hello, Long Island!</i>

18:25.939 --> 18:28.901

- Yeah!

18:28.901 --> 18:31.570
Wait. Is that Jesse?

18:32.696 --> 18:36.366
<i>Guys,
I'm gonna need all your love tonight.</i>

18:36.366 --> 18:37.743
<i>My man walked out on me.</i>

18:59.181 --> 19:01.308

For restoring your friendship.

A cookie basket,
a Lactaid thief,

20:00.742 --> 20:02.244
two bros in a bodega.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.955
I led Sid here every step of the way.

20:04.955 --> 20:06.915
I have no idea

D-did I die this afternoon?
Is that your question?

20:35.152 --> 20:36.361
No, dude, I did not!

20:36.361 --> 20:38.030
EMTs arrived in time,

20:38.030 --> 20:39.907
and as soon as my throat opened up,

20:39.907 --> 20:41.742
I-I got in a car, and I came right here.

20:42.826 --> 20:44.703
Still don't know what happened
to my EpiPen, though.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.752
I thought it was a vape.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.921
There we go.

20:55.380 --> 20:58.926
- I'm a monster.
- No! No, you're not. You're...

20:58.926 --> 21:01.345
You're just bad at identifying objects.

21:01.345 --> 21:04.139
