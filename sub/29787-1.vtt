the local hardware store

do we build it?

45:22.726 --> 45:23.591
Okay, in deep space,

45:23.593 --> 45:26.861
there are suns 200 times
the size of our sun.

45:26.863 --> 45:29.897
When they explode,
they release more energy

45:29.899 --> 45:33.334
than our sun can make
in 20 billion years.

45:40.844 --> 45:43.111
These explosions create

45:51.588 --> 45:54.489
So how do we collect
these gamma rays?

45:54.491 --> 45:55.923
You'll take Callan's cross

45:55.925 --> 45:57.458
to the highest point
you can find,

45:57.460 --> 46:01.629
attach my device to it,
turn it on and stand back.

46:03.566 --> 46:06.467
Then bring it back here
and just build a weapon?

46:06.469 --> 46:09.937
Exactly. You bring it back here,
I'll fuse the gamma rays

46:09.939 --> 46:13.541
to the power in Callan's cross,
it'll create a molnabeam.

46:13.543 --> 46:16.177
Molnabeam's
a military myth.

46:16.179 --> 46:16.944
It's not a myth.

46:16.946 --> 46:19.614
We just didn't need it
till now.

46:19.949 --> 46:22.583
So let me get this straight.
Okay.

46:22.585 --> 46:24.719
We're gonna go
to some random-ass hill,

46:24.721 --> 46:27.822
collect gamma rays
from outer space,

46:27.824 --> 46:30.525
and then we're gonna put
all of this energy

46:30.527 --> 46:32.126
into Callan's cross

46:32.128 --> 46:33.528
with one
of your fancy gadgets,

46:33.530 --> 46:37.365
and then we're gonna go
shoot a molva beam?

46:37.367 --> 46:38.432
Molva?
Molna.

46:38.434 --> 46:40.268

46:40.270 --> 46:44.872

at Drago's amulet.

you pretty much got it.

46:49.045 --> 46:50.812

So you already have one
of these fancy gadgets?

of a pet project of mine.

since I was at MIT.

a molnabeam,
