WEBVTT

00:15.140 --> 00:16.474
[Martha] Clark?

00:17.976 --> 00:19.352
What is this?

00:19.477 --> 00:22.230
This is how you
came to us, Clark.

00:22.313 --> 00:23.481
From the sky.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.568
Right down to here.

00:26.651 --> 00:30.071
[Jonathan] The answers
to everything you want to know,

00:30.155 --> 00:31.740
we think they're all in there.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.499
[spaceship powering up]

00:43.293 --> 00:45.337
[rumbling]

00:48.840 --> 00:50.300
Whoa!

01:03.188 --> 01:04.188
[Clark exclaims]

01:14.324 --> 01:15.950
Uh, hello?

01:16.033 --> 01:18.203
[speaking Kryptonese]

01:20.955 --> 01:22.332
[in English] What's he saying?

01:22.414 --> 01:25.794
I don't think that's
a language from Earth.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.879
[continues in Kryptonese]

01:38.181 --> 01:39.432
[rumbling]

01:41.893 --> 01:45.229
[Jor-El speaking Kryptonese]

01:45.313 --> 01:46.439
-[Martha screams]
-[Jonathan in English] Martha!

01:46.564 --> 01:47.649
[Jor-El continues
in Kryptonese]

01:49.150 --> 01:50.443
[in English] No!

01:53.071 --> 01:54.739
Kal-El, Krypton, it will--

02:02.664 --> 02:03.498
[sighs]

02:12.173 --> 02:13.800
[breathing heavily]

02:16.845 --> 02:18.972
I... I don't want
to come here again.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.349
Clark, I know this was scary,

02:21.433 --> 02:22.851
-but--
-Jonathan, he's right.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.770
We don't know
what this is or who sent it.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.106
Am I not your son?

02:28.231 --> 02:31.026
If I came from that, then I...

02:31.109 --> 02:32.360
[Martha] Honey, no.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.779
You will always be our son.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.615
But I'm not human?

02:37.741 --> 02:38.616
Clark, I...

02:39.617 --> 02:40.952
[sighs]

02:41.036 --> 02:41.953
Who am I?

02:52.881 --> 02:53.840
[Clark yawns]

02:53.965 --> 02:55.716
Why are we here
before work again?

02:55.800 --> 02:58.386
Lois said we needed to come in
early for some big surprise.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.013
[Lois] Ta-da!

03:00.138 --> 03:01.723
Say hello to our new office!

03:03.850 --> 03:04.684
[hissing]

03:06.936 --> 03:09.230
Okay, technically,
it's the newspaper morgue.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.983
-[gas hissing]
-[all coughing]

03:12.108 --> 03:13.651
It's also the boiler room.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.820
And sometimes mail gets sent
here by mistake.

03:15.904 --> 03:16.946
[clanging]

03:19.407 --> 03:21.493
But it's the
perfect place for us

03:21.618 --> 03:23.495
to work on our murder-board.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.871
Our what?

03:24.996 --> 03:26.998
Wait, did you ask Mr. White
if we could be in here?

03:27.082 --> 03:28.375
She definitely did not.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.293
Show us the murder-board!

03:30.377 --> 03:33.672
I made it to help us
track leads for our
Superman investigation.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.841
Who is Superman?

03:38.134 --> 03:40.136
I'm thinking he's maybe
tied to the military.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.305
Please, Lois, I know
what Superman is.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.432
[gasps]

03:46.226 --> 03:47.102
[chuckles]

03:47.185 --> 03:48.395
You think he's a plane?

03:48.520 --> 03:50.021
It kinda looks like a bird.

03:50.146 --> 03:51.815
No, I'm the bird.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.650
[softly] Flamebird.

03:53.733 --> 03:57.821
But who, and what,
is the Superman of Metropolis?

03:57.904 --> 03:59.698
He's an alien!

03:59.823 --> 04:01.366
Case closed.

04:01.449 --> 04:02.701
Why is it so dark in here?

04:02.826 --> 04:04.327
[Jimmy] Wait, don't look.
I'm doing a thing!

04:04.411 --> 04:05.412
[Clark screams]

04:05.537 --> 04:07.706
Boom! Case closed.

04:07.831 --> 04:10.625
We need our conclusion to be
backed by actual facts, Jimmy.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.210
Not whatever "Firebird" is.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.045
Flamebird. It's my stream.

04:14.170 --> 04:17.841
Spreading the truth
about aliens,
and it has five followers.

04:17.923 --> 04:19.968
Nay, believers.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.803
Maybe six if you followed me.

04:21.886 --> 04:24.014
Mm-kay. I'm not following
your weird bird stream.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.517
What I am going to do
is find hard evidence
to bring to Perry.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.894
Like taking this jacket
Superman wore

04:30.020 --> 04:32.689
and finding someone
who can run his DNA off it.

04:32.772 --> 04:37.318
Guys, if we break this,
we'll become real reporters.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.320
This is the story we follow.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.906
Uh, but, uh,
but there are lots of stories
we could bring Perry, right?

04:42.032 --> 04:44.409
Other than this one
that he hates?

04:44.534 --> 04:48.329
Perry doesn't believe us,
but we would have died
without him.

04:48.413 --> 04:52.584
A man flew down from the sky
and risked his life to save us.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.337
Not for a reward, or fame,

04:55.420 --> 04:57.297
but just because
we needed help.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.717
Don't you want to know
who that person is?

05:05.263 --> 05:07.057
You're right.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.767
I need to know.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.353
I, uh, I'm not feeling
so great, though.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.896
It's maybe something I ate.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.398
Oh, I should take care of this.
Uh, see you later.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.109
Come on, Jimmy.
We're leaving too.

05:18.234 --> 05:19.611
Wait, where are we going?

05:19.736 --> 05:21.112
[Lois] Isn't it obvious?

05:21.237 --> 05:23.448
We're gonna find the woman
who tried to kill us.

05:23.531 --> 05:24.574
[Jimmy] Ahhh!

05:26.951 --> 05:28.578
[couple laughing]

05:29.996 --> 05:30.830
[growls]

05:36.294 --> 05:37.337
[weapons powering up]

05:40.298 --> 05:41.633
-[glass breaks]
-Huh?

05:42.300 --> 05:43.593
[all grunting]

05:48.848 --> 05:49.683
[both groan]

05:51.976 --> 05:54.521
I don't know who you are,
but I'm sick of these goons

05:54.604 --> 05:57.816
and that flying freak of yours
following me around.

05:57.899 --> 06:01.611
So let's talk.
City Bistro. Noon.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.155
Come alone
or your Tech is gone.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.203
[humming]

06:10.328 --> 06:11.871
[knock on door]

06:13.832 --> 06:17.127
-Hey, Ma.
-Clark! Perfect timing!

06:17.210 --> 06:21.589
I'm making pie
and your pa is just
fretting about leftovers.

06:21.673 --> 06:24.300
Hmph, but that won't be
a problem with you home.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.885
Wait, why are you home?

06:26.011 --> 06:28.096
Did something happen?
Are you okay?

06:28.179 --> 06:31.683
I'm fine. But I used my powers

06:31.808 --> 06:35.770
to save people and they saw me.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.273
Oh, Clark.

06:38.356 --> 06:41.026
Look, they don't know
it was me, but they know
that someone rescued them,

06:41.109 --> 06:42.152
and now, Lois,

06:42.235 --> 06:44.696
there's this girl, Lois,
and she's amazing,

06:44.821 --> 06:46.823
but, but now she's
calling him Superman

06:46.906 --> 06:48.491
and she wants to know
more about him

06:48.575 --> 06:51.244
and I want to know more
about him too.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.163
Just... Just slow down.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.372
What are you saying?

06:54.497 --> 06:56.541
I need to find out
who I am, Ma.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.251
I need to go back to the ship.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.711
[gasps]

07:00.879 --> 07:02.547
Hold up.
I'm gonna need some more info

07:02.672 --> 07:05.050
before I go
looking for the woman
who tried to murder us.

07:05.175 --> 07:08.178
Superman showed up
when that scary woman
with the robots did,

07:08.261 --> 07:09.721
and he vanished when she did.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.473
So if we want
to find Superman--

07:11.556 --> 07:13.391
We find the woman
he was fighting.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.268
And I know how! We'll--

07:15.393 --> 07:17.437
Hunt down eyewitnesses
from the dock and grill them
about it. Yes!

07:17.562 --> 07:18.730
That's not what
I was gonna say.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.482
Don't argue
with your boss, Jimmy.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.901
Aw. Boss? Excuse me.

07:23.026 --> 07:26.529
We, as in you and me,
are both interns.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.281
We're equals.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.533
Hmm. Raise your hand
if you've been
at the Daily Planet

07:30.617 --> 07:32.243
for longer than Jimmy has.

07:32.369 --> 07:33.745
-Oh, look!
-Hmm.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.081
Therefore, I have seniority,
making me your boss.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.209
Do you think Clark's okay?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.752
I mean, he's sick,
so he's--

07:40.835 --> 07:41.836
Maybe we could
bring him some soup.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.672
I mean, what if he has a fever?

07:43.755 --> 07:45.215
We could drop off
some blankets. Do you think
he likes blankets?

07:45.298 --> 07:46.508
[gasps] You like him?

07:46.591 --> 07:50.136
No! I mean, I... I like him...

07:50.261 --> 07:51.221
Yeah, you do.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.306
I meant professionally, Jimmy.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.724
I don't like, like him.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.685
-Oh, then text him.
-I don't have his number.

07:56.768 --> 07:57.769
[phone beeps]

07:57.894 --> 07:59.938
-Now you do.
-I can't...

08:00.021 --> 08:01.856
Did you add hearts
to his contact name?

08:01.940 --> 08:04.275
Okay. We've got more
important things to focus on.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.694
Now let's get back to work.

08:05.777 --> 08:08.238
Great. Off to find
the stolen boat.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.489
Uh, what?

08:09.614 --> 08:10.949
We don't need
to interview people.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.118
I have photos of the boat
the scary lady stole.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.620
So if we find the boat,
we'll find her.

08:15.745 --> 08:19.624
I know anything that washes up
in Metropolis Bay ends up here,

08:19.749 --> 08:21.459
at the Salvage Docks.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.294
Not bad, eh, partner?

08:23.378 --> 08:26.131
I mean, [scoffs]
it's not the way
I would go about it,

08:26.256 --> 08:29.843
but speaking as your boss,
I say it's worth a shot.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.972
[Martha]
I don't like this, Jon.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.183
What's not to like
about a boy digging up
his childhood spaceship?

08:37.308 --> 08:39.436
It's the most natural thing
in the world.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.729
[growls]

08:40.812 --> 08:42.480
[clears throat]

08:42.605 --> 08:44.941
-Well, I'm not feeling so good.
I better go.
-[Martha groans]

08:45.608 --> 08:47.152
[gasps]

08:47.235 --> 08:50.280
Is it just me,
or is this bigger
than it used to be?

08:54.242 --> 08:55.744
It grew.

08:55.827 --> 08:58.038
You don't have
to do this, Clark.

08:58.163 --> 09:02.876
What if this thing
tries to change you,
or hurt you, or...

09:03.001 --> 09:07.797
I don't know what will happen.
But I need to find out
who I am, Ma.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.846
[spaceship powering up]

09:16.139 --> 09:18.933
But I know who you are.
You're my son...

09:21.353 --> 09:22.187
[gasps]

09:24.606 --> 09:27.067
And I don't wanna lose you.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.196
[whooshes]

09:35.533 --> 09:38.661
[Clark] Okay, this is new.

09:38.745 --> 09:39.871
[Jor-El speaking Kryptonese]

09:41.790 --> 09:44.334
[in English] Are you...
You're responding to me.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.336
[speaking Kryptonese]

09:52.467 --> 09:54.552
[Lois] All right, well,
the boat's not here.

09:54.678 --> 09:56.221
I say we go back to my plan.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.181
-Yes!
-That's the spirit, Jimmy.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.183
-Support your boss.
-No, not that.

10:00.266 --> 10:03.395
I found the boat.
Superman, here we come!

10:07.482 --> 10:09.526
Uh... Or not.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.777
Hold that thought.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.072
[Jimmy] She was here.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.866
I don't know how she blasted
this grate open but--

10:16.950 --> 10:18.993
She had those giant
killer robots with her.

10:19.077 --> 10:22.247
What if those weren't
the only things she stole?

10:22.372 --> 10:25.583
Look, you're right.
She left her bolt...

10:25.667 --> 10:27.544
[Lois] Taking the
stolen stuff with her.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.837
So, if we follow the tracks...

10:28.920 --> 10:30.588
It'll lead us straight to her!

10:30.672 --> 10:31.840
All right!

10:31.923 --> 10:33.800
Team Lois and Jimmy
are on the trail.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.260
Smile for Clark.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.761
[camera shutter clicks]

10:36.886 --> 10:39.139
Uh, wait.
You sent that to Clark?

10:39.222 --> 10:40.932
Sure did, partner.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.018
As your boss,
I need you to stop!

10:43.101 --> 10:45.103
Or let me approve
the pictures first!

10:47.355 --> 10:49.399
[beeping]

10:50.942 --> 10:54.154
[Jor-El speaking Kryptonese]

10:54.279 --> 10:55.655
[in English]
I know you're trying,

10:55.780 --> 10:57.407
but I can't understand you.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.118
[continues speaking Kryptonese]

11:01.661 --> 11:03.997
Uh, what do you want me to do?

11:05.957 --> 11:07.792
[groans] What am I doing here?

11:07.917 --> 11:09.753
I don't even know who you are.

11:10.545 --> 11:11.713
[speaking Kryptonese]

11:21.639 --> 11:23.224
[in English] What's happening?

11:32.984 --> 11:34.736
[lasers zipping]

11:39.324 --> 11:41.326
-[baby crying]
-[Clark] Who is that?

11:44.162 --> 11:45.997
Did you take me from my mother?

11:48.540 --> 11:50.752
Wait. Are you my...

11:54.130 --> 11:57.425
If this is my past, then I...

12:29.332 --> 12:30.291
Clark!

12:35.755 --> 12:37.716
Don't worry. I'm still me, Ma.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.050
I'm still your son.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.348
Of course you are.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.226
But you're
something else now, too.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.979
What did that
Lois girl call you?

12:51.730 --> 12:54.232
Heh. Superman.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.358
It suits you.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.903
But I think this needs
something more.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.905
A belt?

13:01.031 --> 13:02.741
Definitely shorts.

13:02.866 --> 13:03.992
Come with me.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.459
Oh, man.

13:15.253 --> 13:16.087
[beeping]

13:18.840 --> 13:19.924
[gasps]

13:28.600 --> 13:31.311
[Leslie] Marine?
I'm thinking Black Ops.

13:31.436 --> 13:34.064
You can always spot
the military types.

13:34.147 --> 13:37.609
Oh, I know your history,
Leslie Willis.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.027
The thief known as...

13:39.110 --> 13:41.696
Let's skip to the only part
I care about.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.031
I have something you want.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.949
You have something I want.
Let's trade.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.368
What do you want?

13:46.451 --> 13:49.287
I want off your
weird hit list, genius.

13:49.371 --> 13:52.624
You really think you're
the smartest person here,
don't you?

13:52.707 --> 13:57.295
You have no idea
what kind of technology
you're dealing with.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.964
Then I'd say it's a good thing

14:00.090 --> 14:02.133
I planted explosives
all over the city,

14:02.258 --> 14:04.552
and I'm ready to blow
this place sky-high.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.306
Go on.

14:08.431 --> 14:11.476
I lifted 10 containers
of your Tech with the robots.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.355
Them?

14:15.438 --> 14:16.981
I said come alone!

14:25.740 --> 14:26.574
[Slade] You're right.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.493
I am black ops.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.079
[Leslie] And you're right...

14:31.996 --> 14:34.332
I am the smartest one here.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.500
[grunts]

14:35.625 --> 14:37.252
[people screaming]

14:39.879 --> 14:40.880
[Lois] I see the detonator.

14:41.006 --> 14:42.465
You start taking pictures,

14:42.549 --> 14:43.842
I'm going to stop
the explosives
from going off.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.343
Wait, Lois! We should--

14:46.386 --> 14:47.220
[whimpers]

14:49.431 --> 14:51.641
[Martha] The shorts add a lot,
don't they?

14:53.810 --> 14:56.021
Well, I think that does it.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.773
You don't think people
will recognize me?

14:58.857 --> 15:00.191
Oh, sweetheart,

15:00.275 --> 15:02.652
-I barely recognize you.
-[cell phone ringing]

15:02.736 --> 15:03.862
Clark, I...

15:03.945 --> 15:05.947
[whistles]
That's some get-up. Huh.

15:06.656 --> 15:07.991
Uh, your phone.

15:09.909 --> 15:10.994
[Lois] I see the detonator.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.704
You start taking pictures,

15:12.787 --> 15:14.247
I'm going to stop
the explosives
from going off.

15:14.372 --> 15:15.915
[Jimmy] Wait, Lois!
We should--

15:16.041 --> 15:17.667
I have to go.
Love you guys.

15:21.880 --> 15:22.714
[Jimmy exclaims]

15:22.839 --> 15:24.090
[chuckles]

15:25.050 --> 15:26.134
[grunts]

15:53.745 --> 15:54.704
[thuds]

15:56.873 --> 15:57.707
[Lois gasps]

16:09.594 --> 16:12.472
Lo-- [clears throat]
Miss. Are you all right?

16:12.597 --> 16:16.184
Yes. Do you have a comment
for the Daily Planet?

16:16.267 --> 16:17.310
[Clark grunts]

16:20.438 --> 16:22.023
Or maybe we talk after this!

16:22.107 --> 16:23.441
-[car alarms blaring]
-[Leslie] Freak!

16:23.525 --> 16:25.735
You made me lose my robots.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.405
You ruined my operation!

16:29.280 --> 16:31.074
You put a target on my back!

16:32.283 --> 16:33.618
[grunts] Aah!

16:42.752 --> 16:44.796
There's explosives
in the sewers!

16:47.674 --> 16:48.550
[laughs]

16:49.467 --> 16:50.343
[screams]

16:55.390 --> 16:56.433
[electricity crackling]

16:58.435 --> 17:02.480
Why don't you just die already
and get out of my--

17:04.148 --> 17:05.483
[screaming]

17:19.247 --> 17:20.330
[screaming]

17:23.251 --> 17:24.627
[straining]

17:37.182 --> 17:38.516
[screams]

17:44.898 --> 17:49.319
If I'm going down,
I'm taking you with me, freak!

17:50.028 --> 17:51.863
[Clark screaming]

17:51.946 --> 17:54.115
I'm not here to hurt you.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.953
I'm here to help.

17:59.037 --> 18:00.497
[both grunting]

18:28.149 --> 18:29.317
Are you okay?

18:29.401 --> 18:31.486
I am now, Superman.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.701
[sirens approaching]

18:57.887 --> 18:58.972
Stop the presses!

18:59.055 --> 19:00.598
We've got a new
front-page story!

19:00.682 --> 19:01.766
You did it, boss.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.351
[cell phone buzzes]

19:04.102 --> 19:05.687
We did it, partner.

19:05.770 --> 19:09.107
As your partner,
I'll only accept this
if you call Clark.

19:09.190 --> 19:10.567
I... I don't know, Jimmy.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.985
What if he isn't interested?

19:12.110 --> 19:14.779
Lois, you just helped Superman
save the city?

19:14.863 --> 19:18.616
Are you really going to let
a phone call stop you? Hmm?

19:18.700 --> 19:20.869
What are you two still doing
in my office? Get out!

19:20.952 --> 19:23.246
-Oh, it's this thing
we did today where--
-It's actually touching, you--

19:23.329 --> 19:24.873
No, don't start telling me!

19:24.956 --> 19:25.832
I don't care!

19:25.957 --> 19:27.876
Leave! Go! Now!

19:37.052 --> 19:38.345
[cell phone buzzing]

19:38.470 --> 19:40.180
Hey-o, Lois!

19:40.305 --> 19:41.473
Hey-o?

19:41.556 --> 19:43.308
[Lois] Hey-o to you!
[chuckles]

19:43.391 --> 19:44.309
Open your front door.

19:44.392 --> 19:45.935
Uh, one sec.

19:46.978 --> 19:47.812
[grunts]

19:49.356 --> 19:50.190
Surprise! [chuckles nervously]

19:50.315 --> 19:51.566
I was gonna call,

19:51.649 --> 19:53.151
but then I thought, hey,
why stop at calling you,

19:53.234 --> 19:54.861
and then I kinda just
started walking and then I...

19:54.986 --> 19:57.322
Uh, it turns out
it was something I ate.

19:57.405 --> 19:59.824
I'm feeling a lot better.
[chuckles nervously]

19:59.908 --> 20:01.868
How was work today?

20:01.993 --> 20:03.745
Clark, we got the story.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.830
Perry literally stopped
the presses.

20:05.914 --> 20:07.832
I wish you'd been there
to see it.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.542
I wish I could've
been there with you, too.

20:09.668 --> 20:11.461
I still can't believe
we pulled it off.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.673
I mean, we did,
but I can't believe it.

20:14.798 --> 20:16.508
Well, I knew
you'd make it happen.

20:16.591 --> 20:18.343
You just want in on the byline.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.136
No, it's the truth.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.722
There was never
any doubt in my mind
that you'd find Superman.

20:22.847 --> 20:26.476
Because you, Lois Lane,
are extraordinary.

20:27.977 --> 20:31.314
And, uh, driven and smart
and... and funny

20:31.398 --> 20:33.900
and... and smart.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.193
You said that already.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.654
Well, I stand by it.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.364
Oh, good. You're both here.

20:39.489 --> 20:40.865
You have to see this.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.618
Flip gave me an advance copy
of tomorrow's paper.

20:43.702 --> 20:46.329
"Daily Planet confirms,
the Superman is real."

20:46.413 --> 20:47.872
We made the front page!

20:48.957 --> 20:51.543
Read the byline.

20:51.668 --> 20:54.838
"By Cat Grant, Ronnie Troupe
and Steve Lombard."

20:55.839 --> 20:56.840
What!

20:57.924 --> 20:59.342
[gasps]

21:02.345 --> 21:04.514
[man] Leslie Willis.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.183
We found the rest
of your explosives.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.685
Your plan failed.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.895
Now you're going
to tell us everything.

21:11.021 --> 21:12.188
[scoffs]

21:12.272 --> 21:14.691
The explosives
were a distraction.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.568
While you wasted
your time on them,

21:16.693 --> 21:20.071
your Tech was carted away
by every low-level criminal
in Metropolis,

21:20.196 --> 21:23.324
because I sent a message
telling them where I hid it.

21:23.408 --> 21:27.871
[man] We'll get it back.
Nemesis Omega. Zero Day.
Task Force X.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.497
Tell us what you know.

21:29.581 --> 21:32.417
Tell you what a bunch
of gibberish means?

21:32.542 --> 21:33.752
-[electricity crackling]
-[screams]

21:33.877 --> 21:36.212
[man] Zero Day.
Tell us what you know.

21:36.296 --> 21:40.300
Nothing! Nothing! [screaming]

21:40.425 --> 21:42.927
I have no idea, okay?
I'm not lying!

21:43.011 --> 21:46.389
The flying man.
Tell us what you know.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.058
He's not with you?

21:48.141 --> 21:49.267
Who are you people?

21:49.392 --> 21:51.436
[chuckles] That's easy, Willis.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.605
We're the good guys.

21:53.688 --> 21:58.109
Now, tell us everything
you know about Superman.
