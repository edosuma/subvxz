WEBVTT

02:02.456 --> 02:03.958
Are you gonna paint,
or are you just gonna

02:03.958 --> 02:05.876
sit there staring
at the sky all day?

02:06.585 --> 02:08.337
I'm waitin'
on the right conditions.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.509
Only a depressive
loser like you

02:13.509 --> 02:15.427
would stare at a blue sky
and hope for clouds.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.929
It's a study
of the light.

02:17.221 --> 02:18.889
Clouds are more interestin'.

02:19.515 --> 02:20.724
Well, can you come help me

02:20.724 --> 02:22.184
with the garden
while you wait?

02:22.184 --> 02:23.352
Yeah,
I'm not eatin' anything

02:23.352 --> 02:24.562
that comes outta there.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.021
Why not?

02:26.272 --> 02:27.648
Just 'cause you read
about plants

02:27.648 --> 02:29.233
on the internet for an hour

02:29.233 --> 02:30.860
does not make you
an actual gardener.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.654
Your basil from last week
tasted like chlorine.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.865
Oh, so you'd rather eat food
that comes out

02:35.865 --> 02:37.825
of a meat printer
in orbit somewhere?

02:37.825 --> 02:39.243
Yeah. Lesser of two evils.

02:42.538 --> 02:43.914
Okay, there's somethin'.

02:47.960 --> 02:51.005
Also, Mom looked upset.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.924
Did something happen while
you guys were out job hunting?

02:54.633 --> 02:55.843
She's just tired.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.140
Did she find anything?

03:01.140 --> 03:02.474
She will.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.268
Now, plant your vegetables.
I'm tryin' to focus.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.324
You're kiddin' me.

03:21.285 --> 03:22.953
Thought this one
was headin' east.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.539
Yeah, I think
it's a different one.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.626
Hey,
park somewhere else!

03:29.877 --> 03:31.378
People live down here!

03:50.189 --> 03:51.398
<i>Some of you may not be</i>

03:51.398 --> 03:52.858
<i>old enough to remember it,</i>

03:53.484 --> 03:56.278
<i>but life before First Contact
was extremely difficult.</i>

03:56.278 --> 03:58.572
<i>Nearly every human
had to waste</i>

03:58.572 --> 04:00.532
<i>most of their lives working,</i>

04:00.532 --> 04:02.326
<i>and without our technology,</i>

04:02.326 --> 04:04.119
<i>you could only produce
basic commodities</i>

04:04.119 --> 04:06.747
<i>by slowly destroying
your own habitat.</i>

04:07.289 --> 04:09.291
<i>Now, maybe we should have
intervened earlier,</i>

04:09.291 --> 04:11.710
<i>but our scouting fleet
had been watching you</i>

04:11.710 --> 04:13.837
<i>since the year you call 1953.</i>

04:13.837 --> 04:16.340
<i>And if we'd learned anything
about your species,</i>

04:16.340 --> 04:18.092
<i>it's that you weren't
always so quick</i>

04:18.092 --> 04:19.969
<i>to embrace outsiders.</i>

04:19.969 --> 04:21.720
<i>But when we finally landed
our ships</i>

04:21.720 --> 04:23.305
<i>and introduced ourselves</i>

04:23.305 --> 04:24.807
<i>five years ago today,</i>

04:25.391 --> 04:27.309
<i>well, sure, a few of you
thought we were funny-looking,</i>

04:27.309 --> 04:28.936
<i>and some of your governments</i>

04:28.936 --> 04:30.229
<i>did their best
to keep us out...</i>

04:31.689 --> 04:33.649
<i>...but your most
forward-thinking</i>

04:33.649 --> 04:35.567
<i>business leaders saw
the opportunities we brought</i>

04:35.567 --> 04:38.904
<i>for wealth-creation
and industrial efficiency.</i>

04:40.990 --> 04:43.325
<i>- And humankind</i>

04:43.325 --> 04:45.202
<i>finally joined
the rest of the universe</i>

04:45.202 --> 04:47.246
<i>in a new era of prosperity.</i>

04:47.955 --> 04:49.581
<i>That's it for today's lesson.</i>

04:49.581 --> 04:50.958
<i>Once again, my name is...</i>

04:53.168 --> 04:55.170
<i>And I look forward to getting
to know all of you better.</i>

04:55.170 --> 04:56.922
<i>You may now remove your nodes.</i>

05:03.387 --> 05:04.555
So, yeah.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.475
There's your new curriculum.

05:09.685 --> 05:12.271
No more English Lit.

05:12.271 --> 05:13.772
From now on,
you'll be learning

05:13.772 --> 05:16.358
Vuvv Culture and History.

05:18.694 --> 05:21.280
And yes, that, um, thing,

05:21.947 --> 05:23.657
it's gonna be
your new teacher now.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.617
- Save it, please.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.038
Apparently,
my microscopic salary

05:29.038 --> 05:31.165
is too much of a burden
on the school.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.209
I have been underbid

05:34.209 --> 05:36.837
by the little boxes
on your foreheads.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.884
So congratulations, folks.

05:43.469 --> 05:44.887
You're finally rid of me.

05:59.735 --> 06:01.904
<i>...please come to the office.</i>

06:23.550 --> 06:25.803
You know, you really captured
his essence.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.564
I'm thinkin' maybe...
maybe his face

06:37.564 --> 06:39.358
could use a little
more detail, though.

06:46.824 --> 06:47.950
See?

06:47.950 --> 06:49.034
The resemblance.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.120
It's like a photograph.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.746
Exactly.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.168
You're new here?

06:59.086 --> 07:00.254
Just started today.

07:01.213 --> 07:02.297
Yeah, I noticed.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.802
You're in my home room.
Mr. Stanley's.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.638
The hologram formerly known
as Mr. Stanley.

07:14.685 --> 07:15.936
I'm Adam.

07:17.563 --> 07:18.647
Chloe.

07:25.487 --> 07:28.157
We had a perfectly decent
house in the suburbs,

07:28.157 --> 07:30.951
until the Vuvv built a Gorging
Complex right above it.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.494
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.205
They bought out
all the lots around us.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.124
My dad was the last holdout.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.543
But the debris got so bad,
that when he finally sold,

07:39.543 --> 07:41.545
it barely paid us enough
for the gas money to get here.

07:41.545 --> 07:42.629
Jesus.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.631
Wait, so why here?

07:44.631 --> 07:45.924
You guys got family in town
or somethin'?

07:45.924 --> 07:47.384
Yeah.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.969
We were at my uncle's
for a bit.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.345
Technically, we still are
if anyone asks,

07:50.345 --> 07:51.763
since it's in the district

07:52.055 --> 07:53.765
and that's why I'm allowed
to come here.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.350
Wait, why "technically"?

07:55.350 --> 07:57.311
Well, their house
flooded last week,

07:57.686 --> 07:58.979
so we had to move out.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.397
Damn, I'm... I'm sorry.

08:00.898 --> 08:01.940
Where are you now?

08:02.524 --> 08:03.817
You know, we're moving around.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.694
A motel,
when we can afford it.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.196
And when you can't?

08:23.712 --> 08:24.963
Was he a good teacher?

08:26.381 --> 08:27.507
Yeah, I guess.

08:29.051 --> 08:30.928
Always seemed like
he hated his job,

08:32.179 --> 08:33.639
but must have meant
a lot to him.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.809
This sort of thing's getting
way too common.

08:38.268 --> 08:39.269
I know.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.444
Hey.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.696
You guys got a place
to stay tonight?

08:51.198 --> 08:52.574
We'll figure something out.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.163
I got kind of a crazy idea.

09:22.938 --> 09:24.398
We really just can't tell you

09:24.398 --> 09:26.191
how grateful we are,
Mrs. Campbell.

09:26.525 --> 09:27.609
Truly.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.111
Well, happy to help.

09:30.195 --> 09:33.907
Adam is a very empathetic kid.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.409
Not a kid, Mom.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.618
And just so you know,

09:36.618 --> 09:38.829
we're not the type of family
that typically lives out of our car.

09:38.829 --> 09:40.038
Dad.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.542
We actually had a pretty nice
nest egg for a while there.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.879
If I'd just put it all into
Vuvv tech, whoo,

09:47.879 --> 09:50.048
- we'd be great right now.

09:50.549 --> 09:53.010
Well, none of us
were prepared.

09:53.802 --> 09:56.138
Now, we just have to adapt.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.140
That's right.

09:58.890 --> 10:01.018
- You hear that, Hunter?
- Yeah, I heard her.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.896
Anyway, um,
it's so nice to finally

10:04.896 --> 10:07.482
be sitting at a real table
and eating some real food.

10:07.482 --> 10:08.900
It's not real food.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.277
Hunter.
- It's not.

10:10.652 --> 10:12.029
I see how they make it.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.656
They just paste synthetic
cow cells into a mold.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.616
And they print it.

10:17.743 --> 10:18.952
- By the yard.
Hey.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.037
By the mile.

10:20.037 --> 10:21.121
Hey!

10:22.581 --> 10:24.708
However you've prepared it,
it's delicious.

10:30.047 --> 10:31.214
So how long are you staying?

10:31.214 --> 10:32.591
Nat! That's rude.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.009
How is that rude?

10:34.676 --> 10:36.678
I told Chloe her family could
stay as long as they needed.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.680
Oh! Okay.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.558
It's not like we're usin' the
basement for anything else.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.352
Mrs. Campbell,

10:43.352 --> 10:46.063
as soon as we can afford it,
we'll start paying rent.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.273
Mm.

10:49.691 --> 10:52.152
You said they were
only stayin' for one night.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.613
Mom,
they were literally sleeping

10:54.613 --> 10:56.239
in a car under an overpass.

10:56.239 --> 10:57.699
There are lots
of people sleepin'

10:57.699 --> 10:59.743
under overpasses, Adam.

11:00.369 --> 11:02.329
They all can't sleep
in our basement.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.413
Why not?

11:04.706 --> 11:06.541
Seriously, why not
if we have the space?

11:06.541 --> 11:09.252
You can go down
to the overpass right now

11:09.252 --> 11:12.089
and find 10 families that need
more help than they do.

11:12.089 --> 11:15.884
Okay, sure, but none of them
have a kid in my class.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.223
Thank you, Chloe.

11:21.723 --> 11:24.643
Of course. Thank you so much
for dinner. It was delicious.

11:24.643 --> 11:25.727
You're welcome.

11:28.230 --> 11:30.857
That was a weird dinner.

11:30.857 --> 11:31.942
Yeah.

11:33.151 --> 11:34.361
Sorry.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.612
It's not your fault.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.241
Hey, what are you doing
this weekend?

11:40.325 --> 11:42.452
Uh, no plans. Why?

11:44.621 --> 11:46.289
You wanna come
scavenging with me?

11:52.379 --> 11:54.589
The trick is finding
which area they use

11:54.589 --> 11:55.882
as a dumping-ground.

11:57.426 --> 11:59.136
Usually,
it's a field like this.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.140
The shitty part is,

12:03.849 --> 12:05.642
you can only salvage
the stuff that survives,

12:05.642 --> 12:07.185
like, the huge drop.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.065
I mean, that is what
the people up there are like.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.862
They'd rather their shit
be destroyed

12:16.862 --> 12:19.197
than end up
in some pleb's living room.

12:21.199 --> 12:22.742
It sounds like
you've been up there.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.203
Nah. But almost did.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.288
- Once.
- Really?

12:26.788 --> 12:28.123
How?

12:28.123 --> 12:29.791
My dad was
a real estate developer,

12:30.750 --> 12:32.586
and, uh, him and his partner

12:32.586 --> 12:35.130
actually had an offer
to subcontract

12:35.630 --> 12:36.840
for a Vuvv firm...

12:38.133 --> 12:40.510
to, uh, design
the human housing

12:40.510 --> 12:42.637
once they started
lettin' people move up there.

12:42.637 --> 12:43.805
Seriously?

12:43.805 --> 12:44.890
Yeah.

12:45.474 --> 12:46.766
He turned 'em down, though.

12:47.392 --> 12:48.393
Why?

12:49.769 --> 12:50.937
He was a proud guy.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.106
Didn't, uh...

12:53.773 --> 12:55.317
Didn't think the terms
were fair.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.195
I mean, I don't think
he really understood

12:58.195 --> 12:59.613
how quickly the wealth
from down here

12:59.613 --> 13:01.323
would migrate up there,
you know.

13:10.248 --> 13:11.333
Where is he now?

13:11.875 --> 13:12.876
My dad?

13:14.085 --> 13:15.670
Dad is in California.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.217
What are you doing?

13:21.426 --> 13:22.552
I'm just sketching.

13:23.637 --> 13:24.721
Sketching me?

13:26.056 --> 13:27.724
Is that okay?

13:36.066 --> 13:37.234
Yeah, um...

13:38.360 --> 13:40.654
My dad has some thing
for the West Coast.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.240
Once business started
dryin' up around here,

13:43.240 --> 13:44.908
he got convinced
that it was the last place

13:44.908 --> 13:46.701
you could make
a decent livin',

13:47.327 --> 13:48.703
so, thought he'd start fresh,

13:49.287 --> 13:50.455
you know,

13:50.455 --> 13:51.998
start sendin' us back checks.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.334
Did it work?

13:54.876 --> 13:56.127
You'd have to ask him.

13:57.712 --> 14:01.091
To do that, you'd have
to find him first, so...

14:06.721 --> 14:08.974
I'm so sorry, Adam.
I didn't mean to bring up...

14:08.974 --> 14:12.269
No, no.
Uh, it's okay. Um...

14:12.269 --> 14:13.687
Can you, uh...

14:14.729 --> 14:17.524
Can you do that look
you were just doin'?

14:18.567 --> 14:19.985
What?

14:20.277 --> 14:23.113
You were, like...
You were doin' this look,

14:23.113 --> 14:24.531
like, when you were
lookin' up.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.199
Can... Can you do that again?

14:30.537 --> 14:31.621
Like this?

14:32.414 --> 14:33.748
Just like that.

14:41.006 --> 14:43.133
<i>Adam! Adam!</i>

14:45.427 --> 14:46.970
Adam!

14:48.263 --> 14:49.347
Come on.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.643
<i>You ready?</i>

14:54.519 --> 14:55.562
<i>Yes.</i>

14:57.397 --> 14:58.940
Sure you're not
gonna make fun of it?

14:58.940 --> 15:00.358
Yes.

15:00.734 --> 15:01.735
All right.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.988
Here we go.

15:07.324 --> 15:10.076
It's too much build-up now.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.661
Oh, my God, Adam!

15:12.037 --> 15:13.371
Uh, can we do this again?
Like, without the towel...

15:13.371 --> 15:14.956
Just show me!

15:14.956 --> 15:16.499
All right.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.090
Oh, my God!

15:25.425 --> 15:28.845
Is that a good "Oh, my God"
or a bad "Oh, my God"?

15:28.845 --> 15:30.013
Very good.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.348
Very, very good.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.600
It's hilarious but...

15:34.225 --> 15:36.227
And it also really
kinda looks like me.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.938
- You like it? Really?

15:38.938 --> 15:41.399
- I really do.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.276
Well, I want you to have it.
It's yours.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.445
Seriously?

15:45.445 --> 15:47.113
Yeah. I mean, well,
you need somethin'

15:47.113 --> 15:48.782
to put on these walls
down here.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.536
This might be the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

15:53.536 --> 15:54.621
Shut up.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.456
Maybe the second-nicest.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.167
What's the first?

15:59.167 --> 16:01.169
Well, I don't wanna
make you jealous,

16:01.503 --> 16:03.338
but there's this kid
in my class

16:03.338 --> 16:05.298
who let my entire family
stay at his house.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.883
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.343
Sounds like a real try hard,
that guy.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.512
Well, he's actually
extremely kind.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.097
And smart.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.933
Okay, well, now I am jealous.

16:20.689 --> 16:21.731
Chloe?

16:21.731 --> 16:23.316
Uh, yeah?

16:23.733 --> 16:24.859
Oh, hey, Adam.

16:25.235 --> 16:26.611
What's up, Mr. Marsh?

16:28.196 --> 16:29.197
Uh, what's up?

16:30.365 --> 16:34.953
Oh, did you, uh,
do something with my Q-tips?

16:35.912 --> 16:36.955
No.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.498
Huh.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.209
I can't find them.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.380
Well, good luck.

16:49.426 --> 16:50.719
An interesting piece.

16:53.471 --> 16:54.472
Thanks.

17:25.253 --> 17:27.797
So, you guys steal this stuff,
or what?

17:28.423 --> 17:29.507
We found it.

17:29.507 --> 17:30.675
You gonna buy?

17:31.885 --> 17:34.554
I wish I could. Um...

17:34.554 --> 17:36.848
I'm real short on cash.
But if you two could help...

17:36.848 --> 17:38.725
This isn't a charity booth.
Okay?

17:38.725 --> 17:40.185
So, either pay up

17:40.185 --> 17:42.103
or make room
for the other customers.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.524
What other customers?

17:51.488 --> 17:52.489
Sorry.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.699
I guess this was a bust.

17:55.742 --> 17:56.868
It's okay.

17:56.868 --> 17:59.788
No, it's not, though.
I really wanna be able
to pay you guys rent.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.498
Don't worry about it.

18:01.498 --> 18:02.665
Or at least our share
of the heating bills.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.167
Chloe, it's fine, really.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.544
I don't think
we even have our share.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.838
It might be a cold winter.

18:10.799 --> 18:13.343
Well, you're very sweet
to help me with this.

18:16.012 --> 18:19.098
Hey, it's, uh, you know,
somethin' to do.

18:23.978 --> 18:25.146
Hey, you know, we could...

18:26.773 --> 18:29.192
we could always consider
doing a Courtship Broadcast.

18:30.902 --> 18:31.903
A what?

18:32.821 --> 18:35.615
You know, where you set
your nodes to broadcast

18:35.615 --> 18:37.283
instead of receive,

18:37.283 --> 18:38.785
and then they watch you
while you go on dates.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.578
They actually, like,
pay to watch

18:40.578 --> 18:42.789
and then they send it
straight to your account.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.374
You've never heard about this?

18:46.292 --> 18:47.335
Okay, well...

18:48.253 --> 18:49.337
You know,
they don't have, like,

18:49.337 --> 18:50.713
"dating" in their culture.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.298
They don't have "love."

18:52.298 --> 18:54.217
They reproduce asexually.
They "bud."

18:54.217 --> 18:56.553
So, they find romantic stuff,

18:56.553 --> 18:58.721
like, super exotic
and interesting.

19:01.724 --> 19:04.811
Well, anyway,
it's just a thought.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.983
You don't think that'd be
kinda awkward, though?

19:10.692 --> 19:12.151
Not really.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.611
I don't find being
with you awkward.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.738
It's kinda the opposite
of awkward.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.034
Yeah, um...

19:20.034 --> 19:21.661
Um, I...

19:21.661 --> 19:24.080
I mean, I feel the same way.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.291
That's why we'd probably make

19:26.291 --> 19:27.834
a good Courtship Broadcast, actually.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.002
Now that we're talking
about it.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.378
Yeah, but...

19:30.378 --> 19:32.380
You don't wanna just

19:32.380 --> 19:34.549
let it develop,
like, naturally?

19:35.633 --> 19:37.510
We can still
develop naturally.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.929
The more natural the better.
They like natural.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.559
Okay, how does it work?

19:50.231 --> 19:52.150
<i>You have zero current viewers</i>

19:52.150 --> 19:54.277
<i>and zero dollars total.</i>

19:55.361 --> 19:57.655
Your palms
are a little sweaty.

19:58.656 --> 20:00.158
I know. I'm sorry.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.118
Don't apologize.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.162
You know, it's actually
probably a good thing.

20:04.162 --> 20:05.246
Why?

20:05.997 --> 20:07.540
Because this thing picks up

20:07.540 --> 20:09.876
on, like, everything
you're experiencing.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.377
Sight, sound, touch.

20:12.086 --> 20:14.213
They probably like
to feel the nervousness.

20:14.505 --> 20:16.132
Makes it more immersive.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.720
<i>You have zero current viewers</i>

20:20.720 --> 20:23.389
<i>and $0.13 total.</i>

20:23.389 --> 20:25.850
You have nice eyes.
Did you know that?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.187
Thank you.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.652
Shit.

20:36.277 --> 20:37.612
What's wrong?

20:38.071 --> 20:40.490
Well, they don't wanna
see that. It's depressing.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.076
Are you sure they wanna see
any of this? At all?

20:43.534 --> 20:46.496
Well,  they won't
if you keep editorializing.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.583
Come on, loosen up!
Just be yourself.

20:51.626 --> 20:53.544
I hate
when people say that.

20:54.963 --> 20:56.130
What do you mean?

20:56.130 --> 20:57.340
Well, I mean...

20:57.799 --> 20:59.550
I guess I'd just rather be
anyone else.

21:00.510 --> 21:02.720
- You would?

21:06.641 --> 21:07.976
Yeah, wouldn't anyone?

21:11.938 --> 21:15.692
Adam, you don't need
to try to be yourself.

21:16.526 --> 21:17.610
It's not a skill.

21:18.403 --> 21:20.279
You just, like, do nothing.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.323
You just exist.

21:26.619 --> 21:27.870
Just breathe.

21:31.249 --> 21:33.167
Come on!
Breathe with me.

21:56.482 --> 21:57.817
Just like that.

21:58.234 --> 21:59.610
<i>You have six current viewers</i>

21:59.610 --> 22:02.530
<i>and $4.76 total.</i>

22:04.615 --> 22:05.742
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

22:07.618 --> 22:09.746
<i>I'm sorry that
I treated you mean today.</i>

22:11.622 --> 22:13.207
<i>You shouldn't believe
what I say</i>

22:13.207 --> 22:15.001
<i>when I'm with the rest
of the kids.</i>

22:16.002 --> 22:18.838
<i>Nobody... Nobody acts sincere.</i>

22:20.548 --> 22:21.549
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:25.762 --> 22:28.389
<i>You have 427 current viewers</i>

22:28.389 --> 22:31.934
<i>and $1,239 total.</i>

22:31.934 --> 22:33.603
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

22:33.603 --> 22:35.271
<i>I felt like it.</i>

22:38.941 --> 22:40.443
<i>Your lips are soft.</i>

22:58.044 --> 22:59.504
Get out of here.

22:59.504 --> 23:01.214


23:02.215 --> 23:03.591
See how they pound it.

23:03.591 --> 23:05.093
They pound it and it was...

23:05.093 --> 23:06.219
it was tender.

23:07.428 --> 23:09.263
Oh, my God!

23:09.597 --> 23:11.891
I haven't had real meat
in so long.

23:12.183 --> 23:14.268
I know. I'd forgotten
what it tastes like.

23:14.936 --> 23:16.896
To our
two little entrepreneurs!

23:16.896 --> 23:18.439
Mm.

23:18.439 --> 23:19.732
To a very profitable week.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.317
Dad, you're not
supposed to talk

23:21.317 --> 23:23.236
about the broadcast
on the broadcast.

23:23.653 --> 23:25.363
It ruins the suspension
of disbelief.

23:25.363 --> 23:27.490
Well, it ruins dinner
when you're wearing them.

23:27.490 --> 23:29.075
So, why don't you
take 'em off?

23:31.160 --> 23:33.329
It's so nice to sit down
for a family dinner.

23:33.329 --> 23:34.539
Isn't it, Adam?

23:34.539 --> 23:36.582
Sure is.

23:36.999 --> 23:40.128
Family dinner is one of our
most cherished human rituals.

23:40.545 --> 23:41.754
It's an important chance
to strengthen the bond

23:41.754 --> 23:43.297
between parents
and their young.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.757
Helps our numbers
when she explains

23:44.757 --> 23:46.592
- things like that for them.
- Mm.

23:46.592 --> 23:48.010
A good meal like this
isn't just about sustenance.

23:48.010 --> 23:49.637
This ritual also expresses

23:49.637 --> 23:51.264
our camaraderie
for each other.

23:51.264 --> 23:53.683
Do you have to do this
right now, Chloe?

23:54.392 --> 23:56.310
Uh, no, I don't have to.

23:56.310 --> 23:57.728
Do you want me to stop?

23:57.728 --> 23:59.438
I really like Hunter's idea

23:59.438 --> 24:01.816
about no nodes
at the dinner table.

24:01.816 --> 24:03.901
How about we go ahead
and implement that rule?

24:03.901 --> 24:05.111
Sure, sorry.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.822
Um, we'll take a quick break,

24:07.822 --> 24:09.866
and we'll be back
after dinner for...

24:10.283 --> 24:11.659
- What were we doing?
- Uh...

24:13.327 --> 24:15.079
Picking out
your homecomin' dress.

24:15.079 --> 24:16.706
For homecoming dress
picking-out.

24:20.293 --> 24:24.213
<i>You have 87 viewers and $308.</i>

24:24.213 --> 24:25.464
<i>Well, my dear lady,</i>

24:25.464 --> 24:27.133
<i>I don't want to alarm you.</i>

24:27.133 --> 24:28.301
<i>Oh. Well, after tonight,</i>

24:28.301 --> 24:29.719
<i>nothing can alarm me.</i>

24:30.344 --> 24:32.221
<i>I understand.
It must have been terrible.</i>

24:32.221 --> 24:33.931
<i>You have
62 viewers and 200...</i>

24:33.931 --> 24:35.892
Maybe it's nice if we, uh,

24:35.892 --> 24:37.435
just don't wear them
for a while.

24:38.186 --> 24:39.187
Why?

24:40.646 --> 24:42.106
I don't know.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.567
I feel like we barely spend
any time without 'em.

24:45.526 --> 24:47.111
Well, I know.

24:47.111 --> 24:49.530
I think that's part
of why we do so good.

24:49.530 --> 24:50.615
Don't you?

24:51.032 --> 24:52.033
Yeah.

24:54.535 --> 24:56.746
I don't know,
I guess I just wanna know

24:56.746 --> 24:58.122
that, um, you wanna
spend time with me

24:58.122 --> 24:59.540
when nobody's watchin'.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.002
Adam.

25:03.878 --> 25:05.213
Yeah?

25:05.546 --> 25:08.049
A week ago,
I had nothing good in my life.

25:08.674 --> 25:09.675
Nothing.

25:10.593 --> 25:12.094
I mean, I was starting to
think there was nothing good

25:12.094 --> 25:13.804
left in the world.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.265
Then I found you.

25:18.976 --> 25:20.978
<i>On to lesson five.</i>

25:22.939 --> 25:24.690
<i>"Where is the nearest
restaurant?"</i>

25:30.988 --> 25:33.157
" <i>I apologize.
I mean no disrespect."</i>

25:35.368 --> 25:36.744
Dad, I don't even know

25:36.744 --> 25:38.329
how I'm supposed
to make that noise.

25:38.329 --> 25:40.498
No part of my body
can make that noise.

25:40.498 --> 25:43.042
Well, it certainly won't
if you don't try.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.836
So, let's, uh... Yeah,
let's do that one again.

25:47.755 --> 25:49.382
" <i>I apologize.
I mean no disrespect."</i>

25:51.926 --> 25:53.094
Excuse me.

25:53.844 --> 25:55.930
Oh. Hey, Beth.

25:55.930 --> 25:58.224
What, uh...

25:58.224 --> 25:59.308
What is this?

26:00.559 --> 26:02.436
So, we heard about
a last-minute job opening

26:02.436 --> 26:04.105
for a personal
grooming position

26:04.105 --> 26:05.564
up in one of the developments.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.233
But they turned
Hunter away because

26:07.233 --> 26:08.734
they're only considering
humans who speak Vuvv.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.361
And I just found
some language lessons,

26:10.361 --> 26:11.737
so this doesn't happen again.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.155
Ah, I see.

26:13.155 --> 26:15.032
Uh, maybe in the future,

26:15.032 --> 26:17.702
you could just ask me
before using, uh, my computer?

26:18.786 --> 26:20.162
Oh. I'm sorry.

26:20.162 --> 26:21.539
Well, we don't have one, so...

26:22.790 --> 26:23.791
So?

26:24.709 --> 26:27.086
So it's basic human decency
to let us use it.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.713
Okay, Hunter...

26:28.713 --> 26:30.381
Hunter, I don't know
how you were raised,

26:30.381 --> 26:32.967
but in this house,
it's basic human decency

26:32.967 --> 26:35.469
to ask before using something
that doesn't belong to you.

26:40.433 --> 26:42.518
<i>You're almost finished
with the lesson.</i>

26:42.518 --> 26:44.603
- <i>Would you like to continue?</i>
- Hey, Beth.

26:46.022 --> 26:48.774
Could you try not to humiliate
me in front of my son?

26:49.942 --> 26:51.569
Excuse me?

26:51.569 --> 26:53.154
We should have asked,
but that doesn't mean

26:53.154 --> 26:54.655
you have to come in
and disrespect me.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.449
How did I disrespect you?

26:57.325 --> 26:59.410
"I don't know
how you were raised"?

27:00.077 --> 27:03.539
Well, Beth, you're looking
at the man who raised him.

27:03.539 --> 27:05.666
I didn't mean it as an insult
to you or anything.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.293
That was not my intention.

27:07.293 --> 27:10.421
I didn't think
I'd be in this situation.

27:12.089 --> 27:14.467
Broke, dragging
my kids around,

27:14.467 --> 27:16.177
relying on my daughter
for income,

27:16.177 --> 27:17.678
living in a basement.

27:17.678 --> 27:18.929
What does that have
to do with...

27:18.929 --> 27:20.514
Do not speak over me!

27:23.726 --> 27:25.394
You are not better than me.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.147
- All right?

27:28.147 --> 27:29.523
You're not smarter,
you're not stronger,

27:29.523 --> 27:31.067
you're just luckier.

27:31.067 --> 27:32.860
- Mom, what's going on?

27:32.860 --> 27:35.279
You got a lotta nerve
speakin' to me like that.
We're doing you all a favor.

27:35.279 --> 27:36.989
Whoa, we're payin' rent now.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.657
All right, you're not
the fucking Red Cross,

27:38.657 --> 27:40.117
- you're a landlord!
- Hey, hey! Calm down!

27:40.117 --> 27:41.619
- Dad.
- Well, if it's so humbling

27:41.619 --> 27:43.412
living here, you know
what you can do?

27:43.412 --> 27:45.039
You are more than welcome
to pack all your shit

27:45.039 --> 27:46.707
and fuck all the way off.

27:46.707 --> 27:48.417
- That's what you can do.
- Hey, okay. That's...

27:48.417 --> 27:49.960
There's zero need
for that kind of language!

27:49.960 --> 27:51.295
I thought
you were a lawyer.

27:51.295 --> 27:52.963
JD/MBA!

27:52.963 --> 27:54.715
Check the plaque out
on the wall!

27:54.715 --> 27:56.717
And these are not your chips,
Hunter!

27:56.717 --> 27:58.427
What do you mean, they're not
"my" chips? I wasn't saying

27:58.427 --> 27:59.887
- it was my chips!
- These chips are not yours

27:59.887 --> 28:01.889
'cause you didn't ask
for them!

28:01.889 --> 28:04.517
I'm sorry, but you
cannot talk to us this way!
-̌What's going on?

28:04.517 --> 28:06.102
It's not okay!
- Why are we yelling?

28:06.102 --> 28:07.269
And she's not
doing us a favor!

28:07.269 --> 28:08.270
- Hunter!

28:08.270 --> 28:09.522
Calm down!

28:09.522 --> 28:11.732
You know what? Stop!
Just stop! Stop!

28:13.692 --> 28:17.321
I think we need to come up
with a set of very clear

28:18.447 --> 28:21.742
and very simple house rules.

28:33.379 --> 28:34.880
- Rich old bitch.
- I swear to God, Hunter,

28:34.880 --> 28:36.048
if I hear another word
out of you...

28:36.048 --> 28:37.216
Leave it alone, Chlo.

28:42.763 --> 28:44.098
She's not rich.

28:45.099 --> 28:47.059
No one down here is rich.

28:47.601 --> 28:49.520
Well, she's still got
this big-ass house.

28:50.771 --> 28:52.606
Okay, that up there,

28:52.606 --> 28:54.275
that's how rich people act.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.318
I mean, we're just
street people to her.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.737
Doesn't matter
that Dad's an accountant.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.239
We're a bunch of bums!

29:00.239 --> 29:01.615
And she doesn't want
our dirty hands

29:01.615 --> 29:03.492
all over
her computer keyboard.

29:03.492 --> 29:05.244
I mean,
this shit is degrading!

29:06.036 --> 29:07.204
It's...

29:07.204 --> 29:09.039
We need to get outta here.

29:09.039 --> 29:10.666
We're not gonna find
a better situation than this.

29:10.666 --> 29:13.586
What?
Kissing that loser for cash?

29:13.586 --> 29:15.671
Maybe it's not just
about money, Hunter.

29:15.671 --> 29:17.465
Maybe I like him,
and I want to kiss him.

29:17.465 --> 29:19.925
- You ever consider that?
- Yeah, I think you do,

29:19.925 --> 29:22.595
and I think it's the worst
part of this whole thing.

29:23.220 --> 29:24.680
What do you mean?

29:24.680 --> 29:26.599
You're playing lovey-dovey
with a kid

29:26.599 --> 29:28.851
who is locking you and your
family up in his basement!

29:28.851 --> 29:29.935
Enough!

29:31.812 --> 29:35.816
Please, can we just eat?

29:48.287 --> 29:50.247
- What's this?
- It's a bolo, man.

29:50.247 --> 29:52.124
You get it from your little
buddies who have bug friends?

29:52.124 --> 29:54.043
- Get off!
- What are you doing, bro?

29:55.127 --> 29:56.128
Hey!

29:58.422 --> 30:02.468
<i>You have
49 viewers and $207 total.</i>

30:08.641 --> 30:10.643
You look nice.
Where'd you get the suit?

30:14.021 --> 30:15.731
It's my dad's.

30:17.191 --> 30:19.360
Well, it looks great on you.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.324
Yeah, it gets the job done.

30:27.701 --> 30:31.789
<i>You have
62 viewers and $238 total.</i>

30:32.248 --> 30:33.541
You look beautiful.

30:34.375 --> 30:35.376
Thanks.

30:38.212 --> 30:40.089
Hey, um, so, I've been wantin'

30:40.089 --> 30:41.966
to talk about what's been
goin' on with our parents.

30:41.966 --> 30:43.592
Hey. Hey!

30:44.593 --> 30:46.470
Would you keep that shit
out of my line of sight?

30:46.470 --> 30:48.389
Why don't you keep your shit
out of our line of sight?

30:48.389 --> 30:49.765
Yeah, well, how about you get
your own fucking idea

30:49.765 --> 30:51.267
instead of stealing ours?

30:51.600 --> 30:53.852
You didn't invent
Courtship Broadcasts, bitch!

30:56.188 --> 30:57.189
Sorry.

30:57.565 --> 30:58.566
No, it's fine.

30:59.567 --> 31:01.193
What I was tryin'
to say was...

31:01.986 --> 31:03.529
things have kind of been weird
between us

31:03.529 --> 31:05.239
ever since our parents
had that thing...

31:05.239 --> 31:07.491
You know, we can talk about it
another time.

31:11.912 --> 31:13.289
Right.

31:19.336 --> 31:22.756
<i>You have
87 viewers and $308 total.</i>

31:22.756 --> 31:25.509
Except no 'cause, you're...
you're kinda bein' weird,

31:25.509 --> 31:27.011
and maybe we should
just take these off and talk.

31:27.011 --> 31:28.929
So I'm being weird.
It's my fault.

31:28.929 --> 31:30.764
Don't be like that. I'm trying
to make things work.

31:30.764 --> 31:32.224
You're trying
to make this work?

31:32.224 --> 31:33.434
I'm the one
who's always trying

31:33.434 --> 31:34.852
to explain things for them,

31:35.269 --> 31:37.021
and you make me feel like
a lunatic for doing it.

31:37.021 --> 31:38.647
Like this whole thing
is just so painful for you.

31:38.647 --> 31:40.566
Yeah, well,
maybe it is painful for me.

31:41.692 --> 31:42.693
Why would you say that?

31:44.111 --> 31:45.571
Not the "dating you" part,
the...

31:46.405 --> 31:48.449
the... the "doin' it
in front of aliens" part!

31:48.449 --> 31:49.783
You really think that's fun?

31:49.783 --> 31:51.660
- You know what I think?
- What?

31:51.660 --> 31:54.330
I think we should shut up
about this and slow dance.

31:55.372 --> 31:56.373
Fine.

32:08.469 --> 32:11.930
<i>You have 17
current viewers and $13 total.</i>

32:11.930 --> 32:14.308
School is such
a wonderful place, isn't it?

32:14.850 --> 32:16.352
Sure is.

32:16.352 --> 32:17.811
Great place to learn

32:18.312 --> 32:20.939
and hang out between classes
with your girlfriend.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.609
Adam Campbell? Chloe Marsh?

32:25.986 --> 32:28.238
We just got a letter
for the two of you.

32:29.323 --> 32:30.366
What is it?

32:30.366 --> 32:31.784
It just says

32:32.117 --> 32:34.453
"Human Broadcasting
Standards Commission."

32:45.923 --> 32:46.924
Okay.

32:48.008 --> 32:49.385
It looks like it says, uh...

32:49.385 --> 32:51.011
I told you
he couldn't translate.

32:51.011 --> 32:52.429
Anybody else here
take a Vuvv language?

32:52.429 --> 32:53.972
No, I know how to read it. I...

32:54.932 --> 32:57.226
I don't know how
to put this delicately.

32:57.226 --> 32:58.602
- What?
- Just say it.

33:01.188 --> 33:03.899
I think you two
are being sued.

33:03.899 --> 33:04.983
Whoa.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.155
Will you stop tapping
your foot?

33:10.155 --> 33:11.573
Okay,
can you just calm down?

33:11.573 --> 33:12.741
We are goin' to be fine.

33:12.741 --> 33:14.159
How's it gonna be fine?

33:14.535 --> 33:16.036
What do you mean,
"How's it gonna be fine?"

33:16.036 --> 33:17.538
It's probably just
a misunderstanding.

33:17.538 --> 33:20.082
People don't just sue other people
about misunderstandings.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.334
<i>You are
now leaving US jurisdiction</i>

33:22.334 --> 33:24.253
<i>and entering
international air space.</i>

33:24.712 --> 33:29.383
W <i>e are approaching Autonomous
Residential Hub number 113.</i>

33:32.553 --> 33:34.930
There is a driver waiting
for you on the central lawn.

33:36.515 --> 33:37.516
Driver?

33:46.066 --> 33:47.359
So, uh,

33:47.860 --> 33:49.778
how long
have you been with, um...

33:50.279 --> 33:52.781
How long have
I been with (SPEAKS VUVV)?

33:53.866 --> 33:55.075
Yeah, that name.

33:55.659 --> 33:58.495
Did you say, um, "swoo hee"?

33:58.495 --> 34:00.080
It answers to "Shirley,"

34:00.581 --> 34:02.583
for those who can't
handle proper pronunciation.

34:03.667 --> 34:06.754
And I've been working with it
for just over a year.

34:07.504 --> 34:09.173
Did you drive humans
before that?

34:10.632 --> 34:13.343
No, I was a neurosurgeon
before this.

34:13.343 --> 34:15.137
- You're kidding!
- Neurosurgeon.

34:15.137 --> 34:17.806
I used to be
very prominent in the field.

34:17.806 --> 34:20.017
That's why I qualified
for this position.

34:20.768 --> 34:23.729
It's fashionable to have
a powerful human as a driver.

34:25.564 --> 34:26.857
They don't need drivers.

34:27.691 --> 34:28.901
They don't need cars.

34:30.027 --> 34:31.528
They could be zooming around

34:32.070 --> 34:35.032
on self-piloting hoverspheres
like they do in other systems.

34:35.491 --> 34:36.492
But here,

34:37.367 --> 34:38.786
it's how the locals do it.

34:39.369 --> 34:41.246
It's cool.

34:41.246 --> 34:42.748
Wait, so, did you

34:42.748 --> 34:44.625
just run out of business
as a surgeon?

34:45.459 --> 34:46.960
Like, there's not enough
wealthy humans up here

34:46.960 --> 34:48.045
to operate on?

34:53.884 --> 34:56.261
I don't appreciate
your assumptions, my friend.

34:57.137 --> 34:58.722
Sorry.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.557
Of course I still had people
to operate on.

35:02.059 --> 35:03.894
But my starting salary with

35:03.894 --> 35:05.646
is five times what I ever made

35:05.646 --> 35:07.272
in my best years as a surgeon.

35:09.399 --> 35:11.235
And I have kids to look after.

35:15.072 --> 35:17.157
Anyway, we're here.

35:20.661 --> 35:22.496
Wait, where?

35:34.383 --> 35:35.384
Um...

35:36.343 --> 35:37.427
So, do we just...

35:37.427 --> 35:38.595
That's right.

35:40.264 --> 35:41.348
Here,
let me help you down.

35:41.348 --> 35:42.516
Nah, I'm good.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.311
Oh.

35:46.311 --> 35:48.188
And avoid direct eye contact.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.023
It tends to spook them.

36:44.286 --> 36:45.913
<i>Leave us.</i>

37:07.559 --> 37:10.437
So, um, we got your letter.

37:13.315 --> 37:14.900
<i>For a period of time,</i>

37:14.900 --> 37:17.819
<i>your broadcast
was quite enjoyable.</i>

37:19.196 --> 37:20.322
Thank you.

37:22.407 --> 37:23.951
<i>My own offspring,</i>

37:23.951 --> 37:26.870
<i>in fact,
began watching it regularly.</i>

37:27.621 --> 37:28.872
- That's fantastic.
- Wow.

37:31.375 --> 37:34.127
<i>However, it has
recently become obvious,</i>

37:34.127 --> 37:35.671
<i>you are deceiving
your viewers.</i>

37:37.005 --> 37:38.382
- What?
- Deceiving?

37:38.382 --> 37:39.549
- What?
- What do you mean?

37:39.549 --> 37:40.634
Yeah.

37:43.053 --> 37:44.930
<i>The title
of your broadcast</i>

37:44.930 --> 37:47.599
<i>is "Adam and Chloe in Love."</i>

37:48.058 --> 37:49.142
That's right.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.523
<i>And yet,
you are not in love.</i>

37:58.652 --> 38:00.737
I, um... I'm not sure
that's true.

38:02.114 --> 38:03.615
<i>It is fully true.</i>

38:04.157 --> 38:05.617
How do you know?

38:05.617 --> 38:07.452
You don't know
what's in our hearts.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.204
<i>Miss Marsh...</i>

38:12.249 --> 38:14.835
<i>I am an expert
not only in human law,</i>

38:14.835 --> 38:17.587
<i>but also in human
mating customs.</i>

38:17.587 --> 38:21.049
<i>I have been studying them
since before you were born.</i>

38:21.675 --> 38:23.051
<i>You may have been in love</i>

38:23.051 --> 38:24.720
<i>at the beginning
of your series,</i>

38:24.720 --> 38:26.680
<i>but you are no longer.</i>

38:28.015 --> 38:30.058
<i>Your biology betrays you.</i>

38:31.143 --> 38:33.478
<i>Your cheeks no longer
fill with blood</i>

38:33.478 --> 38:34.563
<i>in the other's presence.</i>

38:36.231 --> 38:39.192
<i>Your palms no longer

<i>Your central blood

<i>when holding

38:49.745 --> 38:51.663
Well, what can we do about it?

38:52.247 --> 38:55.042
<i>I want you to repay all funds
you have received.</i>

38:55.375 --> 38:56.460
Wait.

38:56.460 --> 38:58.420
We can't possibly do that.

38:58.420 --> 39:01.131
We've already spent everything
we've made, just to live.

39:03.175 --> 39:04.926
<i>Then I will take you to court</i>

39:04.926 --> 39:07.095
<i>and your families
will be in debt</i>

39:07.095 --> 39:10.265
<i>for approximately
six generations.</i>

39:12.517 --> 39:15.187
Okay, we... we can get
that love back.

39:16.188 --> 39:18.231
Just give us some time
to work on our relationship.

39:18.231 --> 39:19.316
Right?

39:21.109 --> 39:22.110
Yeah.

39:23.195 --> 39:26.448
Yeah, what if...
what if we just started over

39:27.449 --> 39:28.658
and kept doing this?

39:29.409 --> 39:31.828
But we did it
with other people?

39:42.380 --> 39:44.091
So, you didn't think
to talk to me first?

39:44.091 --> 39:46.051
- Like, one-on-one?
- I'm sorry, it just came out.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.302
So, you didn't mean it?

39:47.594 --> 39:48.637
I don't know.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.473
Yeah,
I don't think you meant it.

39:51.473 --> 39:54.226
I think that we both know
that what we have

39:54.226 --> 39:56.603
is the only good thing
in either of our lives,

39:56.603 --> 39:58.313
and it would be a mistake
to let that go.

39:58.313 --> 39:59.856
Something's off, Adam.

40:00.607 --> 40:01.942
I mean, that thing
was right about that.

40:01.942 --> 40:03.068
I know you feel it too.

40:03.652 --> 40:05.362
Okay, fine, yeah,

40:05.362 --> 40:06.530
but that's just the weirdness
with our families.

40:06.530 --> 40:08.323
- I can fix that.
- How?

40:08.323 --> 40:10.075
I... I don't know!
But I can...

40:10.909 --> 40:13.078
Look, everything's
just too complicated now.

40:13.453 --> 40:15.622
Okay? And...

40:15.622 --> 40:17.374
And I think it would
just make more sense

40:17.374 --> 40:19.668
if we separate the business
side of what we do

40:20.377 --> 40:21.586
from our friendship.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.476
Were we ever really friends?

40:40.564 --> 40:42.190
I think I was just a rung
on a ladder to you,

40:42.190 --> 40:44.609
another head to step on
as you climb to the top.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.118
Have you ever slept
on the street, Adam?

40:53.660 --> 40:55.036
No, but what does
that have to...

40:55.537 --> 40:57.497
Have you ever had to take
turns staying up all night

40:57.497 --> 40:59.332
to make sure a bum doesn't run
off with all your possessions?

40:59.332 --> 41:01.168
- Have you ever had to...
- You don't need to lecture me,

41:01.168 --> 41:02.627
all right? 'Cause I've been
through plenty of shit

41:02.627 --> 41:03.837
you haven't
experienced either.

41:03.837 --> 41:05.213
Okay, yeah! And I get that.

41:05.714 --> 41:07.674
Okay, but look, I'm just like
any other person.

41:08.592 --> 41:11.094
Okay? I wanna grow up
and fall in love

41:11.094 --> 41:12.721
and be swept off my feet.

41:13.889 --> 41:15.682
But that's
a higher-order need.

41:16.308 --> 41:17.809
I'll figure that out

41:17.809 --> 41:19.769
after I manage food
and shelter, okay?

41:19.769 --> 41:21.021
<i>Passengers
will be subject to search</i>

41:21.021 --> 41:22.564
<i>at docking station two.</i>

41:22.856 --> 41:25.358
<i>Contraband will be seized
and incinerated.</i>

41:27.194 --> 41:28.528
Ma'am, would you like my seat?

41:37.913 --> 41:41.249
"User agrees that, when
device is set to 'Broadcast,'

41:41.249 --> 41:43.877

human behavior.

41:45.837 --> 41:49.799
"Failure to comply will result

41:50.133 --> 41:51.760
Nobody reads this shit though, right?

41:51.760 --> 41:53.261
I'm sorry, baby.

41:53.595 --> 41:54.721
They got you on this one.

41:55.764 --> 41:57.849
Come on, not with you
defendin' me in court.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.977
I don't think it'd be
a good idea to go to trial.

42:03.605 --> 42:05.357
So... So, what am I supposed
to do?

42:06.441 --> 42:08.068
Convince it to take pity
on you

42:08.068 --> 42:09.402
and drop the charges.

42:09.402 --> 42:11.363
Ma, I already tried that.

42:11.696 --> 42:14.115
I don't think empathy
is a concept for 'em.

42:14.491 --> 42:15.825
But they have hearts.

42:16.243 --> 42:18.912
Deep down in there,
I know they do.

42:18.912 --> 42:20.455
No. No, I'm sayin'

42:20.455 --> 42:22.040
I literally think
they don't have

42:22.040 --> 42:23.959
circulatory systems, period.

42:25.835 --> 42:27.837
I don't know
what to say then.

42:31.174 --> 42:32.676
So, you're just givin' up?

42:35.512 --> 42:37.639
Do you know what type
of lawyers they hire?

42:39.808 --> 42:42.394
I don't even wanna think about the kind of
people that would work with them.

42:42.394 --> 42:43.603
Exactly!

42:43.979 --> 42:45.272
The worst kind.

42:45.272 --> 42:46.773
You irritate them,

42:46.773 --> 42:48.316
they hit you
with heavier charges.

42:48.316 --> 42:49.859
Then we're not even talkin'

42:49.859 --> 42:51.111
about losin' the house
at that point.

42:51.111 --> 42:52.696
Talkin' about debtor's prison,

42:52.696 --> 42:54.489
floatin' over the Antarctic somewhere.

42:56.408 --> 42:57.951
You take on this fight,

42:58.994 --> 43:00.620
it just gets worse.

43:03.415 --> 43:05.208
You know, when I was young,
somebody told me

43:05.208 --> 43:07.794
that it's always better
to fight.

43:09.629 --> 43:11.298
I thought that somebody
was you.

43:22.600 --> 43:23.935
Stop looking at me like that.

43:23.935 --> 43:26.813
Like what?
Guys!
What did I just say?

43:26.813 --> 43:28.648
Yeah, but then
she started staring me down!

43:28.648 --> 43:30.442
Clearly,
you've never been stared down

43:30.442 --> 43:32.277
because this isn't
staring you down.

43:32.277 --> 43:33.695
You know what
I said is true! You know it!

43:33.695 --> 43:35.196
I told you to be quiet!

43:38.116 --> 43:39.492
Are we gonna make it?

43:41.619 --> 43:43.038
What do you mean?

43:44.789 --> 43:46.708
I just mean,

43:46.708 --> 43:48.835
sometimes it feels like
we're not gonna make it.

43:51.421 --> 43:53.923
What, like,
are we gonna survive?

43:56.426 --> 43:58.762
You know, I look
around the world now and...

44:00.472 --> 44:02.349
less and less of it
seems like a place

44:02.349 --> 44:04.309
anyone would wanna be.

44:07.979 --> 44:08.980
Well, jeez, honey.

44:12.984 --> 44:14.110
Sometimes...

44:15.570 --> 44:18.239
you make it really hard
to keep hope alive.

44:26.081 --> 44:27.707
Hey, Nat.
- Yeah?

44:28.500 --> 44:29.876
We're gonna be fine.

44:32.879 --> 44:34.756
Never heard Mom talk
like that.

44:36.383 --> 44:37.717
Don't worry about Mom.

44:40.053 --> 44:41.596
I got you.

45:04.244 --> 45:05.245
Ma'am,

45:05.829 --> 45:07.205
I'm really not sure

45:07.205 --> 45:09.040
when my boss
will next be available.

45:09.541 --> 45:10.792
I've got time.

45:23.513 --> 45:26.683
Is that comfortable
on your skin?

45:27.559 --> 45:29.853
It's not supposed
to be comfortable.

45:31.104 --> 45:32.230
It's chic.

46:30.038 --> 46:31.122
Ma'am.

46:31.873 --> 46:33.249
It'll see you now.

46:55.730 --> 46:56.731
Uh...

46:58.733 --> 47:01.986
Hello, uh, sir, ma'am. Uh...

47:02.612 --> 47:04.364
My name is Beth Campbell,

47:04.364 --> 47:06.324
- uh, and...

47:06.324 --> 47:07.492
<i>Sit.</i>

47:08.785 --> 47:10.703
Okay.

47:20.296 --> 47:22.757
<i>You are
the Campbell mother.</i>

47:22.757 --> 47:24.175
<i>I am aware.</i>

47:28.304 --> 47:31.099
<i>My entire brood
and I have watched</i>

47:31.099 --> 47:32.892
<i>the deceitful broadcast</i>

47:32.892 --> 47:35.395
<i>of the Campbell boy
and the Marsh girl.</i>

47:35.979 --> 47:39.065
Well, I'm glad
to hear it. Uh...

47:39.774 --> 47:43.570
And I'm very sorry
you found it deceitful.

47:45.613 --> 47:49.158
<i>Romantic love
is the most unique and poetic</i>

47:49.158 --> 47:51.578
<i>of all human love modes.</i>

47:52.954 --> 47:54.872
<i>It should never be faked.</i>

47:54.872 --> 47:57.625
Hmm. I, um... I agree.

47:58.918 --> 48:00.503
<i>Then you understand</i>

48:00.503 --> 48:02.922
<i>why your child
must be taken to court.</i>

48:03.339 --> 48:05.091
Well, in theory, yes, but...

48:05.675 --> 48:07.218
<i>In that case,</i>

48:07.218 --> 48:08.803
<i>our business here
is concluded.</i>

48:26.195 --> 48:28.072
Could I ask you a question?

48:31.576 --> 48:32.619
<i>Briefly.</i>

48:34.162 --> 48:35.163
Uh...

48:36.414 --> 48:38.750
The little one that left
your office earlier,

48:39.584 --> 48:42.295
was that a member
of your brood?

48:44.339 --> 48:46.007
<i>That is
my latest offspring.</i>

48:46.674 --> 48:48.468
That's a form of love,
isn't it?

48:48.468 --> 48:50.345
Love for one's offspring.

48:50.345 --> 48:52.305
<i>We don't call this "love."</i>

48:52.722 --> 48:56.517
<i>Love is a human phenomenon,
a bizarre offshoot</i>

48:56.517 --> 48:59.270
<i>of your collaborative
reproductive process.</i>

48:59.270 --> 49:00.605
Well, Shirley...

49:00.605 --> 49:01.689
Can I call you Shirley?

49:02.649 --> 49:04.108
I can assure you

49:04.692 --> 49:08.321
that the reproductive process
isn't always "collaborative."

49:09.238 --> 49:13.993
One sex tends to bear
the burden of the process.

49:13.993 --> 49:17.163
<i>I am well aware
of human mating practices.</i>

49:17.163 --> 49:19.707
Well, then you know what
I'm talkin' about when I say

49:19.707 --> 49:21.876
there's one very unique type
of human love,

49:21.876 --> 49:24.545
even stronger
than romantic love.

49:27.757 --> 49:29.008
<i>Continue.</i>

49:29.425 --> 49:32.095
It's a mother's love
for her children.

49:35.139 --> 49:37.725
I think you know what
I'm talkin' about because...

49:37.725 --> 49:40.353
and I'm goin' out
on a limb here,

49:40.353 --> 49:41.979
but...

49:43.022 --> 49:44.774
I think you feel it yourself.

49:45.692 --> 49:49.028
I think you have
the same kinda love

49:49.028 --> 49:50.488
for your own offspring.

49:52.031 --> 49:53.700
And right now, Shirley...

49:55.618 --> 49:57.286
my children are suffering.

49:58.413 --> 49:59.914
They've lost faith in me...

50:01.165 --> 50:02.834
as their parent

50:02.834 --> 50:04.669
and as their protector.

50:14.971 --> 50:17.598
And I'm hopeful the two of us

50:17.598 --> 50:20.184
can find a creative way...

50:22.145 --> 50:24.147
to pay off my son's debt.

50:31.779 --> 50:33.781
Think of it as a study abroad.

50:33.781 --> 50:35.616
A semester, if you will.

50:35.616 --> 50:37.493
Like a homestay.

50:37.493 --> 50:39.036
Shirley just wants this kid

50:39.036 --> 50:41.372
to be immersed
in the human culture.

50:41.372 --> 50:43.040
By being your husband?

50:43.040 --> 50:45.126
My pretend husband.

50:45.126 --> 50:46.753
Like...

50:46.753 --> 50:49.088
Like Chloe
was Adam's pretend girlfriend.

50:49.088 --> 50:52.008
It gets to play-act having
its own earthling family.

50:52.008 --> 50:54.010
Oh, God.
Why would it even want that?

50:54.010 --> 50:56.888
Because it watches
a lot of node-broadcasts

50:56.888 --> 50:58.848
and old TV shows and...

50:59.432 --> 51:01.642
Look, Shirley thinks
it will open up its mind.

51:02.101 --> 51:04.312
So what? Do you have
to have sex with it or...

51:04.312 --> 51:05.688
Yo, what?

51:05.688 --> 51:07.315
No, Nat! That is disgusting.

51:07.315 --> 51:09.525
It doesn't even have
the equipment for that.

51:09.525 --> 51:11.194
Anyway, for now,

51:11.194 --> 51:12.653
I was able to get her
to drop the lawsuit.

51:12.653 --> 51:14.655
So, as long
as its kid stays happy,

51:14.655 --> 51:16.324
we get to keep the house.

51:18.409 --> 51:19.494
Thank you, Ma.

51:19.494 --> 51:20.828
Don't thank her.

51:21.037 --> 51:22.538
- I'd rather starve.
- Natalie!

51:22.538 --> 51:25.374
This was the best option
we had. All right?

51:25.374 --> 51:27.251
I'm not happy about it either.

51:27.251 --> 51:29.921
So, I don't wanna hear
any more complaints about it.

51:36.010 --> 51:37.178
Honestly?

51:37.929 --> 51:39.096
In a week,

51:39.764 --> 51:41.808
we probably won't even
notice it around.

52:47.790 --> 52:49.709
Do you want me
to cut that for you?

52:51.168 --> 52:52.378
<i>Yes, wife.</i>

52:53.921 --> 52:54.922
<i>Cut it.</i>

53:14.942 --> 53:18.070
Yeah, I think I'mma, um,
finish this in the other room

53:18.070 --> 53:19.822
if everyone's cool with that.

53:19.822 --> 53:21.282
That's fine with me.

53:21.282 --> 53:22.867
I think I'm gonna
head out too.

53:24.660 --> 53:26.662
<i>The small one may go.</i>

53:27.455 --> 53:29.415
<i>The large one must stay.</i>

53:34.462 --> 53:35.796
Um...

53:36.339 --> 53:38.758
They have names
that we call them by.

53:38.758 --> 53:41.135
Uh, this is Adam

53:41.135 --> 53:44.180
and that is Natalie.

53:44.513 --> 53:46.891
Uh... These are my kids.

53:48.768 --> 53:49.810
<i>Yes.</i>

53:50.770 --> 53:53.648
Is there something
you want us to call you?

53:57.151 --> 53:58.778
<i>"Father" will do.</i>

53:59.403 --> 54:01.989
<i>That is your name
for this position, yes?</i>

54:02.698 --> 54:03.950
Um...

54:04.700 --> 54:07.828
Yeah, that's the...
that's the title.

54:08.913 --> 54:11.791
There's usually a name
attached to it though.

54:17.463 --> 54:19.048
<i>"Father" will do.</i>

54:24.512 --> 54:26.722
<i>Before
we start today's lesson,</i>

54:26.722 --> 54:28.224
<i>I wanna remind you</i>

54:28.557 --> 54:29.850
<i>that our class is just one
of many modules</i>

54:29.850 --> 54:31.602
<i>you can access at any time</i>

54:31.602 --> 54:33.312
<i>from the comfort
of your own home.</i>

54:33.688 --> 54:36.107
<i>A few highlights from the rest
of our curriculum</i>

54:36.107 --> 54:39.443
<i>include courses

54:57.878 --> 54:58.879
Hey.

55:01.590 --> 55:03.426
You don't think it's strange
that we live in the same house

55:03.426 --> 55:05.761
but I have to come find you
at school to talk to you?

55:08.514 --> 55:10.349
It's definitely strange.

55:11.642 --> 55:12.727
Well, I hate it.

55:14.645 --> 55:15.938
I see what's going on upstairs.

55:15.938 --> 55:17.440
I'm worried about you.

55:19.191 --> 55:21.777
I mean, things aren't great
downstairs either,

55:22.820 --> 55:24.697
but I just feel like
we can't speak now.

55:25.531 --> 55:27.700
I don't... I don't get
what you're trying to say.

55:31.996 --> 55:34.623
Well, I guess I just wanna
know that you're okay.

55:36.250 --> 55:38.669
Are you okay?

55:43.049 --> 55:44.550
With all due respect...

55:47.219 --> 55:50.264
I don't have time for
a conversation about feelings.

55:52.099 --> 55:55.686
I got "higher-order needs"
to worry about.

56:02.151 --> 56:03.903
<i>That's my boy!</i>

56:05.571 --> 56:07.531
<i>He's half-mine too, you know.</i>

56:09.492 --> 56:10.868
<i>Hey, Pop.</i>

56:14.914 --> 56:16.874
<i>Well, I'm gonna go upstairs
and talk to Jenny.</i>

56:17.666 --> 56:18.876
<i>You do that, son.</i>

56:21.003 --> 56:22.922
<i>Welcome home, son.</i>

56:25.591 --> 56:26.717
Adam.

56:30.971 --> 56:33.057
<i>Come give
your father a hug.</i>

56:34.058 --> 56:35.142
Fuck off.

56:36.060 --> 56:38.395
Adam! You can't talk
to it that way.

56:39.688 --> 56:40.689
Adam!

56:41.524 --> 56:42.900
Do you know what happens

56:43.400 --> 56:44.902
if that thing gets sick of us
and decides to leave?

56:44.902 --> 56:46.737
- Don't care.
- The payments dry up,

56:46.737 --> 56:47.947
- the lawsuit's back on...

56:47.947 --> 56:49.365
...and we lose the house.

56:49.824 --> 56:51.826
Close my damn refrigerator!
Runnin' up my bill.

56:52.451 --> 56:54.411
Also, what are you
doin' home so early?

56:54.411 --> 56:55.746
Don't you have school?

56:56.330 --> 56:57.957
That thing is not my dad.

56:57.957 --> 56:59.125
Where do you think
you're goin'?

56:59.125 --> 57:00.543
To the basement.

57:00.835 --> 57:02.837
- With the Marshes?
- Better than up here.

57:02.837 --> 57:05.047
<i>Ordinary Americans
just want to work,</i>

57:05.047 --> 57:07.007
<i>and they feel
increasingly cut off</i>

57:07.007 --> 57:09.343
<i>from the wealth generated
since the landing.</i>

57:09.343 --> 57:10.928
<i>And to those people,
I would say,</i>

57:10.928 --> 57:13.931
<i>"Go get your piece
of the pie!"</i>

57:13.931 --> 57:15.891
<i>The Vuvv want to trade.</i>

57:15.891 --> 57:18.310
<i>They want to work with humans.</i>

57:18.310 --> 57:19.937
<i>And let's not forget,</i>

57:19.937 --> 57:21.772
<i>their technology
didn't win out by force.</i>

57:21.772 --> 57:23.607
<i>We wanted it because
it's better than ours!</i>

57:23.607 --> 57:25.693
<i>I think this is
a uniquely exciting time</i>

57:25.693 --> 57:27.611
<i>for those with
entrepreneurial instincts.</i>

57:27.611 --> 57:29.488
<i>Please, Steve.</i>

57:29.488 --> 57:32.658
<i>- It's a terrible time
to be an entrepreneur.</i>
<i>Terrible time to be
a bad entrepreneur, sure.</i>

57:32.658 --> 57:34.702
You want a beer, Adam?

57:34.702 --> 57:35.953
<i>You've seen the data!</i>
- I won't tell your mother.

57:35.953 --> 57:37.413
<i>I've seen the data.</i>

57:37.413 --> 57:38.998
- Sure.
<i>Human businesses</i>

57:39.373 --> 57:41.167
<i>are shutting down
at an unprecedented cliff.</i>

57:41.167 --> 57:42.334
<i>Sure, bad,
inefficient human businesses</i>

57:42.334 --> 57:43.669
<i>are being shut down</i>

57:43.961 --> 57:45.171
- <i>at an unprecedented cliff.</i>
- Thanks.

57:45.171 --> 57:46.964
<i>Poor quality products</i>

57:46.964 --> 57:48.591
<i>and over-priced services
are disappearing.</i>

57:48.591 --> 57:50.676
<i>It's called
creative disruption.</i>

57:50.676 --> 57:53.012
<i>- And it benefits the consumer.</i>

57:53.012 --> 57:55.055
<i>I like to compare it
to pruning the bushes</i>

57:55.055 --> 57:57.016
<i>or setting the dead
prairie grass on fire.</i>

57:57.016 --> 57:58.726
<i>I grew up
on a farm, Steve...</i>

57:58.726 --> 58:00.477
Diggin' the new look, Hunter.

58:01.979 --> 58:03.439
Eat a dick.

58:03.439 --> 58:05.274
He gave you a compliment.

58:06.108 --> 58:07.693
He's taking time to adjust.

58:07.693 --> 58:10.321
But Chloe says
it's the look, up there.

58:10.321 --> 58:11.405
She's right.

58:13.032 --> 58:14.366
You hear that, Hunter?

58:14.992 --> 58:17.036
I think it's really gonna
open up his career prospects.

58:17.036 --> 58:19.622
Dad, I'm watching.

58:19.622 --> 58:21.081
<i>...unheard
and abandoned populace.</i>

58:21.081 --> 58:22.708
<i>Who's abandoned them,</i>

58:22.708 --> 58:24.251
<i>- Susan? Who?</i>
You know,

58:24.251 --> 58:25.836
the boneheads
who do stuff like this

58:25.836 --> 58:28.005
only make the rest of us
look uncivilized.

58:28.005 --> 58:29.632
It's not gonna fix
any problems.

58:29.632 --> 58:31.508
It's not supposed
to fix anything.

58:31.508 --> 58:33.093
People are just angry.

58:33.093 --> 58:34.595
Well, if they're angry
with anyone,

58:34.595 --> 58:36.555
they should be angry
at themselves.

58:36.555 --> 58:39.433
For not bein' able to hang
in a more competitive economy.

58:39.433 --> 58:41.769
Well, at some point,
it stops being competition.

58:42.853 --> 58:44.730
Starts being domination.

58:44.730 --> 58:46.690
. <i>..nodes, which
I have called, on the record,</i>

58:46.690 --> 58:48.150
<i>- the most significant...</i>

58:48.150 --> 58:49.818
<i>...breakthrough
in my lifetime!</i>

58:49.818 --> 58:51.487
That's awful rich
comin' from you.

58:52.738 --> 58:54.281
Excuse me?

58:54.281 --> 58:56.116
People like your mother
have been dominating

58:56.116 --> 58:57.785
people like us for decades.

58:57.785 --> 58:58.953
Hunter!

58:58.953 --> 59:01.080
Don't be provocative!

59:01.080 --> 59:03.374
He means landlords
and lawyers.

59:03.374 --> 59:04.833
People... People
like my mother

59:04.833 --> 59:06.627
have been dominatin'
people like you?

59:06.627 --> 59:08.879
Yeah. That's what I said,
rich boy.

59:09.421 --> 59:11.298
Mm.

59:11.298 --> 59:13.175
We must've taken a different
version of US History then.

59:13.175 --> 59:15.761
Yeah. I didn't actually
get to finish high school.

59:15.761 --> 59:16.971
Yeah, no, it shows.

59:16.971 --> 59:18.138
Guys, please.

59:18.138 --> 59:19.807
Fuck this, I'm done.

59:21.433 --> 59:23.310
<i>And why is that?</i>

59:23.310 --> 59:26.480
<i>It's because the tax base
has come absolutely...</i>

59:26.480 --> 59:28.357
I'm sorry about him.

59:29.108 --> 59:30.317
- He's just frustrated.

59:30.317 --> 59:31.777
He's just ignorant.

59:33.779 --> 59:34.780
Okay.

59:36.490 --> 59:37.908
Well...

59:38.450 --> 59:39.660
<i>I think it's getting
increasingly difficult</i>

59:39.660 --> 59:41.370
<i>for our viewers to ignore</i>

59:41.370 --> 59:43.163
<i>- your personal attack.</i>

59:43.163 --> 59:44.999
<i>Now, I'm gonna take
the high road here,</i>

59:44.999 --> 59:46.750
- <i>and remind you that...</i>
- I must say, Adam, it's...

59:46.750 --> 59:48.419
it's just a little galling
to hear you complain

59:48.419 --> 59:50.504
when you guys
are doing so well up there.

59:51.505 --> 59:53.674
What are you talkin' about,
"doing so well"?

59:54.300 --> 59:55.843
I mean, you've got
a house of your own,

59:55.843 --> 59:57.261
an educated parent,

59:57.261 --> 59:58.887
and an actual Vuvv
living with you.

01:00:00.139 --> 01:00:01.432
I mean, Jesus, I...

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.851
I would give my left leg
to give my family

01:00:03.851 --> 01:00:06.103
an opportunity to make
connections like that.

01:00:06.854 --> 01:00:08.314
<i>No, we could all...</i>

01:00:08.314 --> 01:00:09.940
<i>...have a life even down here</i>

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.191
<i>if we simply worked
hard enough</i>

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:12.818
<i>and embraced the present.</i>

01:01:13.379 --> 01:01:14.380
Adam.

01:01:16.507 --> 01:01:17.549
Dad?

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:20.719
Don't wake your mother.

01:01:21.762 --> 01:01:23.347
- What are you doing here?
- Calm down.

01:01:24.598 --> 01:01:26.266
For just one second,
I just wanna talk to you.

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:28.143
It's 2:00 a.m. You couldn't
have called first?

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:31.063
Are you gonna knock my head off
or can you put that thing down for a second

01:01:31.063 --> 01:01:32.564
so we can have a conversation?

01:01:45.828 --> 01:01:47.162
You're right.

01:01:47.746 --> 01:01:48.747
I should have called.

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:51.625
Yeah, or even returned a call.

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:54.837
I was just waiting until I had
some good news to share,

01:01:54.837 --> 01:01:56.130
and it's, uh... it's taking

01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:57.756
a little longer
than I thought.

01:01:57.756 --> 01:01:59.758
Wait, wait, wait,
slow down, slow down.

01:01:59.758 --> 01:02:01.718
I thought you were
in California.

01:02:02.845 --> 01:02:05.514
I was, I was. Um...

01:02:06.682 --> 01:02:08.058
West Coast

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.811
- is dried up.

01:02:10.811 --> 01:02:12.271
Every time I get a foothold

01:02:12.271 --> 01:02:14.773
in a new type of business,

01:02:14.773 --> 01:02:16.984
those things would

01:02:17.443 --> 01:02:19.194
find a way to take it over
and price me out.

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:20.320
Maybe you should've
worked with 'em

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.613
when you had the chance.

01:02:27.578 --> 01:02:28.871
Is that what you think?

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.665
I don't know what I think.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:34.710
So... So you'd rather be
livin' up there?

01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:35.961
I didn't say that.

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:39.631
No, of course.

01:02:41.717 --> 01:02:43.302
No, of course you didn't.

01:02:44.303 --> 01:02:46.013
You, uh...

01:02:46.013 --> 01:02:47.598
You got too much
of your dad in you

01:02:47.598 --> 01:02:48.974
to say somethin' like that.

01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:50.642
What's that mean?

01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:53.854
It means
that we would rather live

01:02:53.854 --> 01:02:55.272
in a cardboard box

01:02:55.564 --> 01:02:58.066
than be some gooey
coffee table's bitch.

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:06.241
They do look like that!

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:07.493
Right?

01:03:10.245 --> 01:03:11.747
They're disgustin'.

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:14.500
You know, speakin'
of disgustin', what's this?

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.210
What's...
What's goin' on here?

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:18.378
Hmm? Your mom didn't teach you
how to shave?

01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:19.755
Come on, man, it's a choice.

01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:22.007
Oh, yeah, nah,
it's definitely a choice.

01:03:24.009 --> 01:03:26.261
Yeah, I'm just messin'
with you, man. You look good.

01:03:28.222 --> 01:03:29.389
You look real good.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:32.976
You grew up.

01:03:41.068 --> 01:03:42.736
A lot's changed around here.

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:45.364
Yeah, I bet.

01:03:53.121 --> 01:03:54.414
So, uh...

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:58.377
how's Nattie?

01:04:01.046 --> 01:04:02.214
She's good.

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:05.050
Doesn't really go by Nattie
anymore though.

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:06.635
She's either Natalie or Nat.

01:04:09.721 --> 01:04:11.974
- Nat?
-  Yeah.

01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:19.523
Man, I really miss you guys.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.321
Your, uh...

01:04:27.906 --> 01:04:29.616
Your mom find someone else?

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:37.165
Hey, not that I have
any right to object.

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:41.295
Does she hate me?

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:48.135
I'll be right back.

01:05:10.115 --> 01:05:12.242
Adam,
what's goin' on in there?

01:06:22.437 --> 01:06:23.438
Dad?

01:07:10.068 --> 01:07:11.111
Nat!

01:07:11.111 --> 01:07:12.195
What?

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:16.742
What is going on?

01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:18.660
I don't know.

01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:20.912
<i>Attention, everybody.</i>

01:07:20.912 --> 01:07:23.457
<i>Attention, we have
some great news to share!</i>

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:26.293
<i>The district has
just implemented</i>

01:07:26.293 --> 01:07:29.045
<i>a new, comprehensive curriculum</i>

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:30.839
<i>on all of your nodes.</i>

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:33.258
<i>So, that means</i>

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.969
<i>you no longer have
to come into school.</i>

01:07:41.933 --> 01:07:44.060
<i>So, you can all go home now.</i>

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:47.647
What?

01:07:48.023 --> 01:07:49.399
What's going on?

01:07:58.408 --> 01:07:59.451
Yeah!

01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:03.830
<i>Well, it's such
a beautiful day,</i>

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:05.665
<i>I hate to get out of bed.</i>

01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:07.459
<i>- Any breakfast left?</i>

01:08:07.459 --> 01:08:09.836
<i>I think so.
I'll get you coffee.</i>

01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:11.588
<i>There's some toast
right there on the...</i>

01:08:11.588 --> 01:08:13.048
<i>Well, now, that's funny.</i>

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:14.716
<i>There was a whole plate
of toast there</i>

01:08:14.716 --> 01:08:16.343
<i>and a whole dish
of strawberry...</i>

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:18.512
<i>...for the offenders.</i>

01:08:18.512 --> 01:08:20.055
<i>A government bill to crack
down on laboratories...</i>

01:08:20.055 --> 01:08:21.807
<i>Change it back.</i>

01:08:21.807 --> 01:08:24.351
<i>...is expected
to become law today.</i>

01:08:24.351 --> 01:08:27.354
<i>Animal rights activists
have been...</i>

01:08:27.354 --> 01:08:29.815
<i>That's okay,
all I want is a cup of coffee.</i>

01:08:29.815 --> 01:08:31.733
<i>And a newspaper
if I can find it.</i>

01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:33.777
<i>Oh, it's over
there on the table, hon.</i>
<i>Oh.</i>

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:35.654
<i>Where are you going?</i>

01:08:36.238 --> 01:08:37.322
<i>For goodness' sake.
Baby, can't you...</i>

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:38.907
To make myself some lunch.

01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:40.492
<i>...when
you finish reading</i>

01:08:40.492 --> 01:08:42.118
<i>instead of curling it up
like this?</i>

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.704
<i>I haven't
even seen it, Pop.</i>
<i>Sit.</i>

01:08:44.704 --> 01:08:46.289
<i>Ricky, then.</i>

01:08:46.289 --> 01:08:47.999
<i>I haven't seen it, either.</i>

01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:49.125
<i>Well,
it didn't get messed</i>

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:51.002
<i>this way all by itself.</i>

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:52.671
<i>Oh, well,
as I'm the only one left,</i>

01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:54.464
<i>I might as well plead guilty,
I guess.</i>

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.550
<i>The family
on the screen-box.</i>

01:08:56.758 --> 01:08:59.135
<i>This is a good human family.</i>

01:09:00.262 --> 01:09:02.347
<i>A financially
productive father.</i>

01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:07.853
<i>A mother who tends the brood
and cleans the nest.</i>

01:09:07.853 --> 01:09:12.440
<i>Our home should replicate this
Golden-Age human experience.</i>

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.734
<i>- It is why I enjoyed</i>

01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:17.279
<i>the broadcast of
your offspring and his mate.</i>

01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:20.448
<i>Smiling. Laughter.</i>

01:09:21.992 --> 01:09:23.535
<i>Love.</i>

01:09:26.204 --> 01:09:28.874
<i>Very good.
My package has arrived.</i>

01:09:30.208 --> 01:09:31.543
You ordered something?

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:35.380
<i>It is for you.</i>

01:09:36.047 --> 01:09:37.507
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>
<i>Hi, dear.</i>

01:09:37.507 --> 01:09:38.717
<i>Boy, that cake
sure looks good.</i>

01:09:57.861 --> 01:09:58.862
Can we go now?

01:10:00.989 --> 01:10:02.616
What's the rush?

01:10:03.450 --> 01:10:05.911
We're gonna be sittin'
in the house for a long time.

01:10:09.164 --> 01:10:10.165
Okay.

01:10:44.449 --> 01:10:46.159
What the hell?

01:11:03.343 --> 01:11:04.719
Yes?

01:11:05.095 --> 01:11:06.304
<i>Hey, I'm looking
for Beth Campbell.</i>

01:11:06.304 --> 01:11:07.889
This is her.

01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:09.766
<i>This is Heather's
Bucket of Broth.</i>

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:11.601
<i>Uh, you left a resume here
about a month ago.</i>

01:11:14.646 --> 01:11:16.147
<i>Time to go relax</i>

01:11:16.147 --> 01:11:17.816
<i>and read the paper
for a while.</i>

01:11:17.816 --> 01:11:19.359
<i>Wait,
I'll get it for you.</i>

01:11:19.359 --> 01:11:21.861
<i>Where are you going?</i>
- I'm headed out.

01:11:21.861 --> 01:11:23.321
I'll be back in a few hours.

01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:26.825
<i>What is "out"?</i>

01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:29.536
I just got a job.

01:11:31.538 --> 01:11:32.914
<i>Explain this.</i>

01:11:32.914 --> 01:11:34.958
Work. A job.

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:37.836
I interviewed for it
a long time ago,

01:11:37.836 --> 01:11:41.089
and they just called me
out of nowhere

01:11:41.089 --> 01:11:43.425
and, uh, they said
they needed me

01:11:43.425 --> 01:11:45.552
to come help out immediately.

01:11:45.552 --> 01:11:47.345
I'm really excited about it.

01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:51.141
<i>What the heck
is going on around here?</i>

01:11:51.141 --> 01:11:52.684
<i>Nothing's going on.</i>

01:11:53.351 --> 01:11:56.479
<i>Gee whiz, what has
happened to our happy home?</i>

01:11:57.272 --> 01:12:00.400
<i>My wife
does not need a job.</i>

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.735
<i>I provide.</i>

01:12:04.696 --> 01:12:07.198
- Except you don't.

01:12:07.198 --> 01:12:09.451
Your parent pays me.

01:12:09.451 --> 01:12:10.952
And frankly,

01:12:11.369 --> 01:12:14.706
they don't pay me nearly
enough to deal with this shit.

01:12:14.706 --> 01:12:16.291
And so...

01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:17.459
<i>My wife will not go...</i>

01:12:17.459 --> 01:12:20.211
Hey, paddles down, honey.

01:12:20.211 --> 01:12:21.504
I'm not done yet.

01:12:23.298 --> 01:12:24.549
And so,

01:12:24.549 --> 01:12:26.718
I will take this job

01:12:26.718 --> 01:12:28.178
because the salary
isn't great,

01:12:28.178 --> 01:12:30.138
but it's enough to scrape by.

01:12:30.138 --> 01:12:33.266
And I'd much rather scrape by
and have my kids' respect

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:36.186
than be your human prop.

01:12:36.186 --> 01:12:37.854
So, if that pisses you off,

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:40.398
you can go ahead and waddle on
up to your mama

01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:41.733
and have her sue us.

01:12:42.442 --> 01:12:45.361
But just know this, your wife

01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:46.654
has a law degree.

01:12:46.654 --> 01:12:48.823
Graduated top of her class.

01:12:48.823 --> 01:12:52.118
And even though
you might outspend me,

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:54.537
you will never outwork me.

01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:58.666
So, I ask you politely now.

01:13:00.752 --> 01:13:03.046
Please move.

01:13:06.216 --> 01:13:07.217
Did you hear me?

01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:12.514
Move before I move you.

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:16.559
<i>Sit down, wife.</i>

01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:19.771
Okay, then.

01:13:21.773 --> 01:13:23.233
Stop it!

01:13:23.233 --> 01:13:25.860
You slippery...

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:27.070
Hittin' me with your...

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:28.154
Stay!

01:13:29.572 --> 01:13:31.116
Stay.

01:13:31.116 --> 01:13:32.826
<i>In fact
he insists upon it.</i>

01:13:32.826 --> 01:13:33.910
<i>- Wait a minute!</i>

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:34.994
Mm!

01:13:35.954 --> 01:13:37.455
Now, watch that!

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:40.875
And don't you ever hit me
with your paddles again.

01:13:40.875 --> 01:13:42.961
Disrespectin' me.

01:13:42.961 --> 01:13:45.672
I'll scoop soup
the rest of my life

01:13:45.672 --> 01:13:48.883
before dealin' with
any more of this crap!

01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:11.364
<i>You know, Harriet, the more
I think about this true...</i>

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:12.949
<i>- ...the more I'm definitely...</i>
- Are you all right?

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:14.951
<i>...convinced
that he was wrong.</i>

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:17.620
<i>You know, it's funny
you should say that...</i>
- Sir?

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:18.788
<i>...because,
the more I think about it...</i>

01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:57.911
Mom?

01:14:59.204 --> 01:15:00.205
Shh.

01:15:03.208 --> 01:15:04.792
<i>Thank you, wife.</i>

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:09.339
<i>My offspring,
how were your days?</i>

01:15:12.175 --> 01:15:13.259
Our day was great.

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:16.679
School was cancelled
so me and Zach just...

01:15:17.263 --> 01:15:18.681
scavenged for things to sell.

01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:27.190
Excuse me, honey.

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:31.402
Don't say a word.

01:15:32.237 --> 01:15:33.238
Okay.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:38.701
Look, your mother has
only herself to blame.

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:40.328
It saw that our family
was a better match

01:15:40.328 --> 01:15:42.330
for what it was looking for,
and it chose us.

01:15:43.248 --> 01:15:44.415
If you want it back,
you can try

01:15:44.415 --> 01:15:45.541
to offer it a better service.

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.126
But at this point,

01:15:47.126 --> 01:15:48.920
we are the superior
value proposition.

01:15:51.756 --> 01:15:53.174
Can't argue with that.

01:15:54.926 --> 01:15:56.010
What's
your name again?

01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:57.095
Good.

01:15:58.513 --> 01:16:00.223
Zach.
- 'Cause I feel guilty but...

01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:01.641
What do you do, Zach?

01:16:01.641 --> 01:16:02.725
...I know you'd do
the same to us.

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:04.185
I go to school.

01:16:04.519 --> 01:16:06.562
- I take Vuvv language.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:07.855
And I crossed paths
with your sister.

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.318
- You got the job!

01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:14.153
- Look at this.
Yeah, Hunter.

01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:15.571
I was just clarifying.

01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:18.616
Do you think
that deal's still on

01:16:18.616 --> 01:16:20.910
if it's a different family
but in the same house?

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:23.454
As long as it doesn't
complain to Shirley.

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:26.124
<i>Cut it, wife.</i>

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:30.586
<i>As you did before.</i>

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:32.839
I think
it thinks he's you.

01:16:32.839 --> 01:16:35.133
All humans look the same
to them, I guess.

01:16:35.133 --> 01:16:36.884
Well, I wouldn't
let 'em know.

01:16:37.885 --> 01:16:39.846
I could use
the free babysittin' services.

01:16:44.809 --> 01:16:46.060
Y'all want some soup?

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:47.395
Yeah.
Come on.

01:16:57.739 --> 01:16:59.490
No, what are you...
Stop, stop, stop.

01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:00.867
Give me this.

01:17:00.867 --> 01:17:02.618
Come on. Wrist, wrist.

01:19:30.224 --> 01:19:31.809
What are you doin' here?

01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:38.691
Oh.

01:19:40.735 --> 01:19:41.736
Here.

01:19:44.739 --> 01:19:47.700
<i>I decided to go out</i>

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:50.119
<i>to explore the rest
of the human world.</i>

01:19:51.037 --> 01:19:54.749
<i>The streets do not resemble
those I see on the screen-box.</i>

01:19:54.749 --> 01:19:56.709
<i>I became lost.</i>

01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:58.211
Are you all right?

01:19:58.211 --> 01:19:59.378
<i>Yes.</i>

01:20:03.758 --> 01:20:05.593
<i>This is from you?</i>

01:20:16.479 --> 01:20:17.480
Yeah.

01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:22.193
<i>What purpose
does it have?</i>

01:20:24.403 --> 01:20:25.947
It'd take
too long to explain.

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:30.785
I'm not even really sure
I know.

01:20:40.628 --> 01:20:41.671
Let's go home, yeah?

01:21:11.409 --> 01:21:12.868
Adam!

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:14.078
I'm sleeping!

01:21:15.955 --> 01:21:18.165
Something's happening
at the school!

01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:20.668
Something about your mural?

01:21:22.044 --> 01:21:23.254
What are you talkin' about?

01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:26.632
Nat, what do you mean?

01:21:40.187 --> 01:21:41.522
- Sorry, excuse me, excuse me.
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:21:41.522 --> 01:21:43.608
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:21:43.608 --> 01:21:47.111
Folks! I'm gonna need you
to give us more space.

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:49.780
This is my last warning.

01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:54.076
Adam.

01:21:55.453 --> 01:21:57.163
What is this?

01:21:57.163 --> 01:21:59.206
Uh, I... I... I don't know.

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:02.793
The little one saw
your mural yesterday, right?

01:22:02.793 --> 01:22:04.253
Right.

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:06.547
Then I guess it brought
its... friends.

01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:08.341
- Congrats, I guess.

01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:10.509
<i>Campbell child.</i>

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:14.722
<i>You are the creator
of this human art.</i>

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:16.932
Huh...

01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:19.060
Yes, I am.

01:22:21.395 --> 01:22:25.107
<i>This is one of
our most important experts in</i>

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:27.401
<i>and collectors of human art.</i>

01:22:30.363 --> 01:22:31.364
Oh.

01:22:31.989 --> 01:22:33.741
Hi. I'm Adam.

01:22:36.619 --> 01:22:38.454
<i>You will now speak</i>

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:41.040
<i>a few words of explanation
for your human art.</i>

01:22:43.376 --> 01:22:47.046
Oh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, right.
Right. Uh, of course.

01:22:47.046 --> 01:22:49.048
Of course. Um...

01:22:49.048 --> 01:22:50.132
I, uh...

01:22:53.344 --> 01:22:55.846
I... I guess, uh, I just...

01:22:58.474 --> 01:23:02.561
I've been through
a lot recently and, um...

01:23:03.813 --> 01:23:05.064
Well...

01:23:06.273 --> 01:23:10.403
I kinda just wanted to let it
all flow out of me, you know.

01:23:12.655 --> 01:23:13.823
Let go of the past

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:17.952
and face the world, you know.
Not as I want it to be but...

01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:20.371
just as it is.

01:23:21.956 --> 01:23:24.667
'Cause, uh... We've, um...

01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:32.800
We've lost a lot
since you guys came here.

01:23:38.139 --> 01:23:39.974
But we've overcome
a lot too, so...

01:23:41.142 --> 01:23:43.352
Um, this is...

01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:47.898
I guess that's what this is.

01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:50.067
This is my monument to, uh...

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:54.196
to human resilience.

01:24:00.119 --> 01:24:01.662
<i>Young person,</i>

01:24:02.079 --> 01:24:04.081
<i>it is unfortunate
to see an artist of your skill</i>

01:24:04.081 --> 01:24:07.501
<i>stuck in this dank backwater.</i>

01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:09.378
<i>We would like to hire you</i>

01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:12.131
<i>as our official
artist-in-residence</i>

01:24:12.131 --> 01:24:14.091
<i>to further develop your work</i>

01:24:14.091 --> 01:24:18.304
<i>and to distribute it
across our entire territory.</i>

01:24:19.221 --> 01:24:22.016
<i>We will begin
with a one-year contract</i>

01:24:22.016 --> 01:24:25.311
<i>at a salary
of 2.7 million dollars.</i>

01:24:26.729 --> 01:24:28.314
- Holy fuck, dude.
- Oh, my God.

01:24:28.314 --> 01:24:29.940
You're gonna be rich.

01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:32.985
Uh...

01:24:32.985 --> 01:24:34.862
I... I don't know what to say.

01:24:55.716 --> 01:24:57.176
Thank you all
for having me tonight.

01:24:57.176 --> 01:24:58.385
You don't have to talk.

01:24:58.385 --> 01:25:00.012
Just eat.

01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:01.597
<i>You have 16 viewers</i>

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:03.974
<i>- and $13 total.</i>
Whoo!

01:25:03.974 --> 01:25:06.435
Holy shit!

01:25:06.435 --> 01:25:08.354
- Shut up!
- Okay! Okay.

01:25:08.354 --> 01:25:11.065
- Okay.

01:25:11.065 --> 01:25:12.858
They could at least have
the dignity to keep it down.

01:25:12.858 --> 01:25:14.068
Dad!

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:17.613
If it makes you
feel better, Mr. Marsh,

01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:19.907
I... I think his mural sucks.

01:25:19.907 --> 01:25:21.992
I mean, like,
he can't even draw people.

01:25:21.992 --> 01:25:23.410
Like, she's orange.

01:25:23.702 --> 01:25:25.204
You know what would
make me feel better?

01:25:25.204 --> 01:25:27.373
Is if you and my daughter
had any viewers.

01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:31.252
Would you excuse me, please?

01:25:35.756 --> 01:25:37.758
I haven't seen
that many zeroes

01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:40.261
on a piece of paper
in a long time.

01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:42.888
This has gotta
be a joke, right?

01:25:42.888 --> 01:25:44.473
No, it's not a joke.

01:25:44.932 --> 01:25:46.433
It's somebody finally seeing

01:25:46.433 --> 01:25:48.686
how good you are
at what you do.

01:25:49.562 --> 01:25:51.647
I am so proud of you, Adam.
Come here.

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:53.983
- Thank you.
- I'm so proud of you.

01:25:53.983 --> 01:25:55.401
Thank you.

01:25:55.693 --> 01:25:57.444
I'm gonna go dig out
that bottle of champagne

01:25:57.444 --> 01:25:58.904
and pop it.

01:25:58.904 --> 01:26:00.489
- Champagne?
- You and me and you,

01:26:00.489 --> 01:26:02.741
- we drinkin' tonight!

01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:05.202
Whoo!

01:26:09.123 --> 01:26:10.749
What's up?
You don't look too happy.

01:26:11.876 --> 01:26:12.918
I am.

01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:14.628
I'm really happy for you.

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:17.214
Nat, this not about me.

01:26:18.048 --> 01:26:19.174
This is about us.

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:20.259
I know.

01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:22.845
Just wish you didn't
have to leave.

01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:25.764
It's... It's only
a few months though.

01:26:26.599 --> 01:26:28.142
I'll be back
before you know it.

01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:32.396
What?

01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:35.774
Nothin'.

01:26:36.817 --> 01:26:38.861
I just feel like
I've heard that one before.

01:26:39.904 --> 01:26:41.280
Somewhere.

01:27:11.185 --> 01:27:12.186
Mm.

01:28:23.799 --> 01:28:24.800
Yeah.

01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:43.003
<i>Then, you'll be shuttled</i>

01:29:43.003 --> 01:29:45.005
<i>to another one of our ships</i>

01:29:45.005 --> 01:29:48.550
<i>where you'll begin work
on another piece of human art.</i>

01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:51.887
<i>We will send you
to 12 galaxies.</i>

01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:55.057
<i>You will complete a new
centerpiece in each.</i>

01:29:55.057 --> 01:29:57.601
<i>And then,
we will duplicate your work</i>

01:29:57.601 --> 01:30:00.062
<i>and sell it
in each of our systems.</i>

01:30:00.062 --> 01:30:03.732
<i>Soon, every species
in our Co-Prosperity Alliance</i>

01:30:03.732 --> 01:30:05.484
<i>will be moved by the poetic</i>

01:30:05.484 --> 01:30:08.862
<i>and primitive humanness
of your human art.</i>

01:30:08.862 --> 01:30:09.947
Sure.

01:30:12.407 --> 01:30:14.451
<i>But first,
Campbell youth,</i>

01:30:14.451 --> 01:30:18.080
<i>you will make a short speech
in front of your first work.</i>

01:30:19.498 --> 01:30:20.791
Back... Back on Earth?

01:30:22.251 --> 01:30:24.628
<i>Not on Earth. Here.</i>

01:30:36.265 --> 01:30:38.600
You... You guys
recreated the whole mural?

01:30:41.353 --> 01:30:43.397
<i>We did not reproduce it.</i>

01:30:43.397 --> 01:30:45.399
<i>We transported it here.</i>

01:30:46.692 --> 01:30:50.195
<i>And implemented
minor edits for clarity.</i>

01:30:53.282 --> 01:30:54.408
Edits?

01:32:22.829 --> 01:32:24.706
<i>Go on.
Tell them about your work.</i>

01:32:24.706 --> 01:32:28.126
<i>Tell them how our arrival
has helped you</i>

01:32:28.126 --> 01:32:32.631
<i>transcend your barbaric nature
and create beautiful art.</i>

01:32:33.799 --> 01:32:35.217
I, uh...

01:32:36.802 --> 01:32:37.803
I...

01:32:43.642 --> 01:32:46.603
Uh, I... I started, uh...

01:32:48.230 --> 01:32:49.898
Uh...

01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:02.995
I can't do this.

01:33:51.043 --> 01:33:52.836
- Damn!

01:33:52.836 --> 01:33:55.130
What the hell
is goin' on out here?

01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:58.675
My baby! My baby...

01:33:58.675 --> 01:34:00.010
- The hell...

01:34:00.802 --> 01:34:02.971
Baby, what's going on?
What happened?

01:34:02.971 --> 01:34:04.765
I... I couldn't do it, Ma.

01:34:04.765 --> 01:34:06.433
- What do you mean?
- I... I couldn't do it.

01:34:06.433 --> 01:34:08.602
I refused the money.
We... We lost it all.

01:34:08.894 --> 01:34:10.312
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
I'm sorry.

01:34:10.312 --> 01:34:11.646
- What?
What's happening?

01:34:11.646 --> 01:34:13.231
- Are you okay?
- It's over, Nat.

01:34:13.231 --> 01:34:14.441
I'm... I'm sorry,
I messed up, y'all.

01:34:14.441 --> 01:34:15.942
Beth, shut up!

01:34:16.401 --> 01:34:17.736
You shut up, Curtis!

01:34:17.736 --> 01:34:20.280
Go to bed with your nosy self.

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:23.450
Look. Baby, look at me.
Look at me.

01:34:24.618 --> 01:34:26.286
You didn't mess up anything.

01:34:26.787 --> 01:34:27.871
Okay?

01:34:28.455 --> 01:34:30.248
You're right where
you're supposed to be.

01:34:31.792 --> 01:34:32.793
Come on.

01:35:14.459 --> 01:35:15.544
You're back?

01:35:23.093 --> 01:35:24.261
What are you doin' here?

01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:26.513
Couldn't sleep.

01:35:29.474 --> 01:35:31.852
I thought you were gonna be
up there for months.

01:35:33.728 --> 01:35:34.896
Yeah, I was.

01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:38.984
Changed my mind, though.

01:35:46.158 --> 01:35:47.451
I saw them
rip the wall off

01:35:47.451 --> 01:35:49.327
and airlift it away.

01:35:50.454 --> 01:35:51.872
It was awful.

01:35:51.872 --> 01:35:53.039
Yeah.

01:36:01.673 --> 01:36:03.592
It was a beautiful thing
you made.

01:36:04.509 --> 01:36:05.927
They shouldn't be able
to do that.

01:36:09.931 --> 01:36:11.057
Thank you.

01:36:18.899 --> 01:36:20.400
I'm sorry.

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.068
It's not your fault.

01:36:23.153 --> 01:36:25.405
No, I mean it,
like, generally.

01:36:27.115 --> 01:36:28.325
I'm sorry.

01:36:32.996 --> 01:36:34.122
Me too.

01:36:50.764 --> 01:36:51.932
What are you doing?

01:36:52.557 --> 01:36:54.935
I figured they left
some of it standin'.

01:37:35.684 --> 01:37:37.435
You just gonna stand there
all night?
