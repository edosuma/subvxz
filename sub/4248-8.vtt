WEBVTT

00:34.033 --> 00:38.621
SPECIALLY FOR YOU.

00:38.705 --> 00:42.542
{\an1}SOMEONE HAS REFITTED THE OLD
CHANDELIER.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.295
{\an1}RESTORED TO ITS FORMER
GLORY.

00:45.378 --> 00:46.004
LOOKS GOOD, DOESN'T IT?

00:46.087 --> 00:47.630
WHO DID THIS?

00:47.714 --> 00:49.632
FABIAN AND NINA.

00:49.716 --> 00:53.344
{\an1}THOSE TWO ARE AMATEUR
HISTORIANS, I TELL YOU.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.805
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.433
OH VICTOR. DON'T WORRY,

00:58.516 --> 01:01.227
{\an1}IT'LL BE ME WHO'LL BE
DUSTING IT.

01:08.067 --> 01:10.945
{\an1}SO WHEN DID YOU AND AMBER
SUDDENLY BECOME BEST BUDDIES?

01:11.029 --> 01:12.489
WE SHARE A ROOM.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.408
{\an4}I'M SORRY, CAN WE DO THE
PART WHERE YOU INTERROGATE
ME TOMORROW.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.453
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.749
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

01:22.832 --> 01:27.212
A FRIEND GAVE IT TO ME.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.174
(owl hoots)

01:31.257 --> 01:37.138
HELLO? IT'S PATRICIA. DID
YOU GET JOY'S PHOTO? GOOD.

01:37.222 --> 01:40.183
{\an1}NO I WAS ACTUALLY CALLING
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

01:40.266 --> 01:43.228
{\an1}I THINK I'VE FOUND THE EYE
OF HORUS.

01:43.311 --> 01:47.190
{\an1}YEAH. THANKS RENE. I'LL TRY
MY BEST.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.442
{\an1}HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU CAN
TRUST THIS MAN?

01:49.526 --> 01:50.819
{\an1}HE'S HELPING ME FIND JOY
OKAY?

01:50.902 --> 01:54.322
{\an1}AND ANYWAY, WHO ELSE CAN I
TRUST?

01:54.405 --> 01:55.406
(Knock knock knock)

01:55.490 --> 01:56.699
(Victor shouting)
<i>ENOUGH OF THE NOISE IN THERE.</i>

01:56.783 --> 01:58.701
<i>LIGHTS OUT NOW.</i>

02:25.603 --> 02:27.939
YES!

02:28.022 --> 02:28.940
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:29.023 --> 02:31.568
{\an1}IT'S MY ROOM! I CAME TO GET
MY TOOTHPASTE.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.278
{\an1}WHY ARE YOU SNOOPING THROUGH
NINA'S STUFF?

02:33.361 --> 02:37.699
{\an1}SHE WAS GONNA LEND ME A TOP.
I JUST CAME TO FIND IT.

02:37.782 --> 02:38.950
{\an1}AM I SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU GUYS ARE NOW SUCH

02:39.033 --> 02:43.121
{\an1}GOOD FRIENDS THAT YOU SWAP
OUTFITS?

02:43.204 --> 02:45.123
{\an5}WHAT'S IN YOUR HAN?

02:43.204 --> 02:45.123
NOTHING.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.919
{\an1}LOOK AMBER, WE'VE BEEN
FRIENDS FOR A LOT OF YEARS.

02:50.003 --> 02:50.753
OFF AND ON.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.922
{\an1}I NEED YOU TO KEEP THIS A
SECRET. PLEASE.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.592
{\an1}I WASN'T STEALING THE
LOCKET.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.844
{\an1}THERE'S A REALLY GOOD REASON
WHY I NEED TO BORROW IT.

02:57.927 --> 03:01.264
LIKE WHAT? A FASHION
EMERGENCY?

03:01.347 --> 03:02.515
OH. HEY.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.685
{\an1}HI. WELL THANKS FOR THAT
AMBER.

03:05.768 --> 03:10.106
CATCH YOU LATER, YEAH?

03:10.189 --> 03:14.152
{\an1}YOU OKAY? YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST.

03:14.235 --> 03:18.197
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

03:19.866 --> 03:23.411
{\an1}(Girl's voice)<i> "I'LL BE ON</i>
<i>MY OWN AGAIN, WITH HIM.</i>

03:23.494 --> 03:25.288

03:25.371 --> 03:27.624
{\an6}MR RUTTER.

03:25.371 --> 03:27.624
{\an4}<i>(Girl's voice) "I'M</i>
<i>FRIGHTENED OF WHAT WILL</i>
<i>HAPPEN TO ME."</i>

03:27.707 --> 03:30.418
{\an4}LISTENING TO MUSIC WHILST
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
STUDYING,

03:30.501 --> 03:32.921
SHOWS VERY LITTLE RESPECT TO ME.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.798
{\an1}I'M REALLY SORRY MISS. IT
JUST HELPS ME TO THINK.

03:35.882 --> 03:43.640
{\an1}YOU KNOW THE RULES. MP3S ARE
NOT ALLOWED IN CLASS.

03:43.723 --> 03:44.641
WHEN WILL I GET IT BACK?

03:44.724 --> 03:48.603
WHEN I'M READY.

03:48.686 --> 03:52.273
(Whispers) FABIAN!!

03:54.567 --> 04:05.078
(Clock chimes twelve o'clock)

04:07.747 --> 04:12.293
(hollow sounding knock)

04:14.963 --> 04:19.216
{\an1}LET'S FACE IT BROTHER, WE ARE
SO OUT OF THE BABE RACE.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.510
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

04:20.593 --> 04:24.013
{\an4}RIGHT. SO WAS THAT YOUR
CLONE ESTHER SHUT DOWN
YESTERDAY?

04:24.097 --> 04:27.016
ESTHER'S MAD ABOUT ME. SHE
JUST DOESN'T KNOW IT YET.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.810
SAME AS AMBER WITH YOU MATE.

04:28.893 --> 04:33.856
{\an1}OKAY. SO WHAT'S YOUR LATEST
BIG IDEA CASANOVA?

04:33.940 --> 04:36.901
{\an1}IF MUSIC BE THE FOOD OF
LOVE, PLAY ON.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.778
WE PLAY THEM SOME MUSIC?

04:38.861 --> 04:39.946
NO!

04:40.029 --> 04:43.616
{\an1}OH I KNOW, I KNOW, WE WRITE
THEM SOME MUSIC.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.284
A SONG FOR AMBER, YEAH?

04:45.368 --> 04:48.913
{\an1}I WAS THINKING A SONNET?
POETRY?

04:48.997 --> 04:53.876
{\an1}MY SONG WILL BE POETRY MAN.
A TUNE TO END ALL TUNES.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.212
{\an1}OH YEAH, I'M GETTING THE
VIBE ALL READY.

04:56.295 --> 05:01.676
{\an1}(Alfie plays a bad tune on
his Kazoo)

05:02.802 --> 05:04.846
ANY LUCK?

05:04.929 --> 05:07.265
{\an1}I WAS WONDERING IF THIS
JEWEL BIT TURNS OR SOMETHING.

05:07.348 --> 05:10.852
{\an1}BUT IT'S REALLY STIFF. I COULD
DO WITH SOME BRUTE STRENGTH?

05:10.935 --> 05:14.897
DON'T GIVE IT TO FABIAN THEN!

05:14.981 --> 05:18.067
WHAT'S INSIDE?

05:19.027 --> 05:22.739
'KHET IS THE PLACE TO FIND.

05:22.822 --> 05:26.743
{\an1}AND THERE IN THE FLAMES, YOU
MUST LOOK BEHIND.'

05:26.826 --> 05:30.413
EVEN I HAVE NO IDEA.

05:42.300 --> 05:47.263
CAUGHT RED HANDED. I WAS
JUST ABOUT TO TURN IT ON.

05:47.346 --> 05:50.850
{\an1}WHAT HAVE YOU GOT ON THERE,
ANYWAY?

05:50.933 --> 05:53.144
CRADLE OF FILTH.

05:53.227 --> 05:56.105
THRASH METAL BAND. GRRR.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.484
PROBABLY NOT FOR ME.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.694
{\an1}MR SWEET ASKED ME TO BRING
YOU THIS.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.572
{\an1}AH YES. I'LL TAKE THAT.
GIVE IT TO ME.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.866
{\an1}I DON'T SUPPOSE I COULD HAVE
THAT BACK?

06:06.949 --> 06:11.162
IT'S MEANT TO BE A
PUNISHMENT.

06:11.245 --> 06:15.249
{\an1}WE'RE READY FOR THE STAFF
MEETING, MRS ANDREWS.

06:15.333 --> 06:19.170
YES. I'LL BE THERE.

06:19.253 --> 06:25.093
{\an1}RIGHT, GO NOW BEFORE I
CHANGE MY MIND.

06:26.928 --> 06:30.223
"KHET KHET?"

06:30.306 --> 06:33.434
{\an1}GOT IT! KHET MEANS "FIRE" OR
"PLACE OF FIRE."

06:33.518 --> 06:39.482
{\an1}PLACE OF FIRE. YES!! REVERSE
IT AND WHAT DO YOU GET?

06:39.565 --> 06:40.733
FIRE OF PLACE?

06:40.817 --> 06:47.323
{\an4}AMBER, DO YOU SEE ANYTHING
THAT I'M STANDING RIGHT NEXT
TO?

06:47.406 --> 06:50.368
THE FIREPLACE.

06:50.451 --> 06:54.872
OH! OF COURSE, THE FIREPLACE.

06:56.415 --> 07:00.002
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:00.086 --> 07:02.880
{\an1}WHY ARE YOU FOOLING AROUND
IN THE FIREPLACE?

07:02.964 --> 07:06.926
{\an1}WE'RE...COLLECTING SOOT
FOR AN ART PROJECT.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.345
ABOUT POMPEII. EXTRA CREDIT.

07:09.428 --> 07:12.098
{\an1}I DON'T LIKE YOU SNOOPING
AROUND THE HOUSE.

07:12.181 --> 07:14.267
CHANDELIERS, FIREPLACES.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.811
{\an4}WE'RE TAKING THE CHANDELIER
DOWN, AS SOON AS FABIAN GETS
BACK.

07:16.894 --> 07:18.146
NO. LEAVE IT UP THERE.

07:18.229 --> 07:18.980
BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID.

07:19.063 --> 07:21.315
{\an1}YES I DID, BUT I'VE CHANGED
MY MIND.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.025
{\an1}I SHALL WANT YOU ALL IN BED
EARLY TONIGHT.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.485
LIGHTS OUT, NINE O' CLOCK.

07:24.569 --> 07:27.029
{\an1}AND I SHALL EXPECT TO HEAR A
PIN DROP AFTER THAT.

07:27.113 --> 07:27.238
TELL THE OTHERS.

07:27.321 --> 07:28.281
BUT

07:28.364 --> 07:30.575
<i>NO BUTS, NO BUTS.</i>

07:31.826 --> 07:34.912
WE'LL COME BACK TO THIS LATER.

07:40.459 --> 07:43.504
{\an1}I THOUGHT WE WERE GETTING
ALONG THESE DAYS?

07:43.588 --> 07:44.422
WE ARE.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.924
{\an1}SO GOING THROUGH MY STUFF IS
GETTING ALONG?

07:47.008 --> 07:48.885
{\an1}I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL WE ARE
B.F.F.'S.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.678
I KNEW IT. AMBER!

07:50.761 --> 07:51.470
DON'T BLAME HER.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.389
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE
THE SAME THING

07:53.472 --> 07:55.349
{\an1}IF YOU SAW SOMEONE STEALING
MARA'S THINGS.

07:55.433 --> 07:55.975
I WASN'T STEALING.

07:56.058 --> 07:59.312
SO WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

07:59.395 --> 08:02.231
YOU'RE SO SECRETIVE,
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

08:02.315 --> 08:06.235
{\an1}YOU TRIED TO TAKE MY LOCKET
AND I WANT TO KNOW WHY?

08:06.319 --> 08:09.030
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

08:09.113 --> 08:10.573
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THE TIME?

08:10.656 --> 08:13.075
{\an1}I'VE TOLD YOU I WANT EVERYONE
IN BED EARLY TONIGHT.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.661
{\an1}NOW GO TO YOUR ROOM
IMMEDIATELY MISS MARTIN.

08:15.745 --> 08:19.123
NIGHTY-NIGHT.

08:23.836 --> 08:27.006
{\an1}(Bad American accent) WHAT

08:27.089 --> 08:29.258
ODE TO AMBER, Y'ALL:

08:34.514 --> 08:36.849
LIKE MAKING YOURSELF LOOK GOOD

08:36.933 --> 08:38.142

08:38.226 --> 08:40.144
TO GET TO SIT WITH YOU

08:40.227 --> 08:41.102
{\an1}AND MAKE EVERY JOCK AND
SKATER DUDE

08:41.187 --> 08:43.563
SO JEALOUS THAT THEY SPEW.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.316
{\an1}OH-KAY. THANKS ALFIE. THAT
WAS

08:45.399 --> 08:46.817
TOTALLY AND UTTERLY

08:46.901 --> 08:47.526
YEAH?

08:47.610 --> 08:48.277
HORRIBLE.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.278
OH'

{\an1}SWEET, BUT SERIOUSLY, DON'T
QUIT YOUR DAY JOB.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.325
{\an1}VICTOR'S ON THE WARPATH GUYS
AND IT IS NOT PRETTY.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.827
{\an6}OH-OH.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.827
{\an5}TIME TO MAKE A QUICK EXIT.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.455
WHAT IS GOING ON?

08:59.538 --> 09:00.748
I WAS JUST AT THE SCHOOL

09:00.831 --> 09:03.000
{\an1}AND THE TEACHERS WERE ACTING
REALLY, REALLY WEIRD

09:03.084 --> 09:05.169
{\an1}AND THEN AS SOON AS I GET BACK,
VICTOR BITES MY HEAD OFF

09:05.253 --> 09:06.587
{\an1}AND SENDS ME STRAIGHT
TO MY ROOM.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.256

09:11.384 --> 09:12.760
CLOSE, BUT NO.

09:12.843 --> 09:14.762
(Victor shouting)
<i>IT'S NINE O'CLOCK.</i>

09:14.845 --> 09:16.764
<i>YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES</i>

09:16.847 --> 09:22.728

AHHH!

10:57.031 --> 10:58.574
{\an1}I ASKED YOU TO KEEP A
SECRET!

10:58.657 --> 11:01.535
{\an1}SHE'S KNOWN ME SINCE WE WERE
ELEVEN.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.914
{\an4}BUT NOW SHE'S SIDING WITH
SOMEONE WHO'S ONLY
BEEN HERE TWO MINUTES.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.124
PATRICIA.....WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:07.208 --> 11:08.250
BETRAYAL THAT'S WHAT.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.252
{\an1}YOU DON'T GO THROUGH
PEOPLE'S PRIVATE THINGS HERE.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.879
IT'S LIKE, AN UNWRITTEN RULE.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.798
{\an1}I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY A
WRITTEN RULE

11:15.633 --> 11:16.092
(Gasps)

11:16.175 --> 11:17.885
SOME FRIEND YOU ARE.

11:26.143 --> 11:29.647
{\an1}PATRICIA, DID YOU BRING THE
EYE OF HORUS?

11:29.730 --> 11:33.150
{\an1}NO. THE NEW GIRL, NINA, SHE
HAS A LOCKET WITH IT ON

11:33.234 --> 11:34.402
I ALMOST HAD IT.

11:34.485 --> 11:35.820
WHERE DID SHE GET IT FROM?

11:35.903 --> 11:38.197
SHE SAID A FRIEND
GAVE IT TO HER.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.490
ALL RIGHT, BRING HER TO ME.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.909
{\an1}DOES SHE HAVE SOMETHING TO
DO WITH JOY'S DISAPPEARANCE?

11:41.992 --> 11:43.619
YEAH, POSSIBLY.

11:43.702 --> 11:44.787
I KNEW IT!

11:44.870 --> 11:48.707
(chatter)

11:48.791 --> 11:53.379
{\an4}I HAVE TO GO. I WILL TEXT
YOU A TIME AND PLACE
FOR US TO MEET,

11:53.462 --> 11:55.339
{\an1}BUT MAKE SURE THAT YOU BRING
NINA ALONG.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.466
HOW AM I GOING TO DO THAT?

11:57.550 --> 11:58.634
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY B.F.F'S.

11:58.717 --> 12:02.304
{\an1}YOU ARE A BRIGHT GIRL
PATRICIA.

12:02.388 --> 12:06.142
{\an1}I'M SURE YOU'LL THINK OF
SOMETHING.

12:09.228 --> 12:16.152
{\an4}NOW I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL
HUNGRY FOR THE LATEST

12:22.074 --> 12:23.742
SORRY, MRS ANDREWS.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.703
(Text message tone)

12:25.786 --> 12:31.500
{\an1}AH, YES. I AM GETTING
MIGHTILY FED UP WITH THIS.

12:31.584 --> 12:35.045
{\an1}YESTERDAY, IT WAS MR RUTTER
AND HIS MUSIC PLAYER.

12:35.129 --> 12:38.507
TODAY, MISS WILLIAMSON. YOU
ALL KNOW THE SCHOOL RULES.

12:38.591 --> 12:42.178
NO MOBILE PHONES, NO MP3S.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.304
MISS WILLIAMSON
HAND IT OVER.

12:43.387 --> 12:46.348
IT'S OKAY. I'LL SWITCH IT
OFF AND PUT IT IN MY BAG.

12:46.432 --> 12:50.186
{\an4}NO, THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD
HAVE DONE. NOW YOU CAN GIVE
IT TO ME.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.858
{\an1}OKAY EVERYONE, YOU ALL KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.208
NO-BODY. NOT ONE BODY.

13:12.291 --> 13:16.170
OKAY. LET'S GO.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.387
OH!

13:25.471 --> 13:27.264
I'M SORRY.

13:27.348 --> 13:30.851
{\an1}IT'S OKAY. PROBABLY JUST A
MILD CONCUSSION.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.523
HEY ROMEO AND JULIET.

13:35.606 --> 13:39.777
YEAH, MOVING SWIFTLY ON.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.698
{\an1}THERE'S NOTHING HERE. BUT I
WAS SO SURE.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.700
MAYBE WE'VE MISREAD THE RIDDLE?

13:46.784 --> 13:52.248
{\an1}MAYBE. OR MAYBE IT'S JUST
NOT THIS FIREPLACE.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.960
{\an1}OF COURSE. THE HOUSE IS
CENTRAL HEATING NOW.

13:56.043 --> 13:59.255
{\an4}I BET A LOAD OF THESE OLD
FIREPLACES WERE BRICKED UP
WHEN IT WAS FITTED.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.091
{\an1}HOW ARE WE GOING TO FIND OUT
WHERE THEY WERE?

14:04.885 --> 14:06.971
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO VISIT SARAH.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.434
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?

14:12.518 --> 14:15.854
{\an1}I'VE JUST CONFISCATED IT
FROM PATRICIA.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.111
RENE ZELDMAN.

14:22.194 --> 14:25.447
R.Z?

14:25.531 --> 14:29.660
HE'S BACK. RUFUS ZENO IS BACK.

14:30.869 --> 14:34.373
{\an1}I HOPE WE CATCH SARAH IN ONE
OF HER MORE LUCID MOMENTS.

14:34.456 --> 14:39.378
{\an4}SHE CAN GET VERY CONFUSED. I
MEAN, SHE COULD SEND US TO A
FIREPLACE BACK IN 1972.

14:39.670 --> 14:43.507
SARAH, SARAH DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

14:43.591 --> 14:47.720
(Whispers) I'VE NEVER SEEN
HER WITH A VISITOR BEFORE.

14:48.012 --> 14:53.601
{\an4}SARAH, TRY TO CONCENTRATE.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE OLD DAYS.

14:53.684 --> 14:56.437
I REMEMBER YOUR FACE.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.690
THAT'S GOOD.

14:59.773 --> 15:03.402
<i>BUT I GET SO MUDDLED.</i>

15:03.485 --> 15:08.490
{\an1}SARAH, JUST RELAX.
EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.910
I'LL GET YOU SOME TEA.

15:27.885 --> 15:31.430
PASS THE JUICE PLEASE MARA.

15:37.811 --> 15:42.358
{\an1}WELL, AREN'T WE QUIET
TONIGHT?

15:42.441 --> 15:42.941
NO KIDDING.

15:45.944 --> 15:50.658
SO WHAT'S WITH THE
SILENT TREATMENT?

15:51.575 --> 15:53.535
{\an1}WHAT YOU DID TO AMBER
WAS TERRIBLE.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.953
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK, MARA?

15:55.037 --> 16:00.376
{\an1}YOU WENT TOO FAR. PLUS I WAS
ON CLEAN-UP DUTY.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.252
{\an1}YEAH, OKAY, YOU'RE PROBABLY
RIGHT.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.421
WHOAH.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.799
I'M SORRY AMBER.

16:06.882 --> 16:09.301
{\an1}FALLS OFF HIS CHAIR IN
AMAZEMENT.

16:10.094 --> 16:13.013
{\an4}DID PATRICIA "I AM NEVER
WRONG" WILLIAMSON JUST
APOLOGISE?

16:13.097 --> 16:14.932
SHUT UP SLIMEBALL.

16:15.015 --> 16:19.436
(Sniff sniff) OH AND NICE
COLOGNE - EAU DE CAT PEE?

16:19.520 --> 16:21.063
THAT'S HYSTERICAL.

16:21.146 --> 16:24.733
AND NINA. I'M SORRY ABOUT
GOING THROUGH YOUR STUFF.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.735
THE THING IS,
I DID HAVE A REASON

16:26.819 --> 16:28.028
{\an1}AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,
I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT.

16:28.112 --> 16:33.659
{\an1}NOT NOW OBVIOUSLY.
BUT, IN PRIVATE SOMETIME?

16:33.742 --> 16:40.541
{\an1}YEAH, SURE. YOU, ME, NO
WITNESSES. SHOULD BE FINE.

16:40.624 --> 16:44.545
SERIOUSLY, I'D LIKE TO TALK.

16:49.550 --> 16:55.097
SO ARE YOU TAKING PATRICIA
UP ON HER OFFER THEN NINA?

16:55.180 --> 16:58.976
NINA? NINA?

16:59.059 --> 17:02.604
COULD THAT BE A FIREPLACE?

17:02.688 --> 17:08.902
{\an4}REMEMBER ON PARENTS' DAY,
WHAT TRUDY SAID ABOUT THIS
OVEN DOOR NOT OPENING.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.529
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

17:10.612 --> 17:14.199
OKAY. THIS IS A REAL
LONG-SHOT BUT.

17:20.204 --> 17:21.498
(Gasps) HA HA HA.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.375
NOT THAT LONG, I GUESS.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.669
WOW!

17:27.212 --> 17:30.424
{\an1}YES! IT OPENS UP RIGHT
INSIDE HERE.

17:30.507 --> 17:33.302
{\an1}IT'S A SECRET PASSAGE WAY.
WITH STEPS GOING DOWN.

17:33.385 --> 17:37.306
OH WELL OF COURSE. KHET.
INFERNO, PLACE OF FIRE.

17:37.389 --> 17:38.557
OKAY, ENGLISH, PLEASE.

17:38.640 --> 17:43.604
{\an1}INFERNO? úHELL'! THE CLUE
MEANS 'DOWN IN HELL'.

17:43.687 --> 17:44.521
IT'S REALLY DARK DOWN THERE.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.941
(Trudy calls)<i> HELLO?</i>

17:49.818 --> 17:51.820
{\an1}TONIGHT. AFTER LIGHTS OUT.
SIBUNA?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.322
SIBUNA.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.549
(Amber screams) A GHOST!

18:12.633 --> 18:15.010
MORE LIKE A SHEET.

18:15.093 --> 18:18.889
{\an1}CAN WE FIND A LIGHT SWITCH.
PLEAAAASE.

18:18.972 --> 18:23.727
{\an1}BAD THINGS DON'T HAPPEN WHEN
THE LIGHTS ARE ON.

18:25.312 --> 18:29.233
{\an1}OKAY GUYS,
LET'S CHECK THIS OUT.

18:35.405 --> 18:39.117
{\an1}THIS PLACE IS WEIRDING ME
OUT. CAN WE GO?

18:39.201 --> 18:40.160
NOT YET.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.287
WE NEED TO FIND THE NEXT CLUE.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.705
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU
TOUCH HERE GUYS.

18:43.789 --> 18:48.335
{\an4}LOOKS LIKE THERE MIGHT BE
SOME OTHER LITTLE SURPRISES
DOWN HERE.

18:48.418 --> 18:55.509
{\an1}THIS STUFF SMELLS OLD AND
GROSS. EURGH.

18:55.592 --> 18:59.221
GUYS LOOK ON THE WALL.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.556
FLAMES.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.767
{\an1}"THERE IN THE FLAMES, YOU
MUST LOOK BEHIND".

19:03.851 --> 19:06.937
{\an1}THAT'S EASY. IT'S EVEN GOT
LIKE A RING PULL THING ON IT.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.939
MAY AS WELL SAY
"PULL ME" ON IT!

19:09.022 --> 19:12.568
{\an1}IT'S NOT A RING PULL, AMBS,
IT'S A TETHERING RING.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.779
TO TIE ANIMALS TO.

19:27.916 --> 19:32.421
IT SEEMED LIKE SUCH A GOOD PLAN.

19:32.504 --> 19:35.757
{\an1}(Gasps) LOOK - NUMBERS. A
CODE?

19:35.841 --> 19:36.550
SIBUNA!

19:37.092 --> 19:38.552
SIBUNA!

19:38.635 --> 19:39.428
(Loud noise)

19:39.511 --> 19:41.597
{\an5}WHAT WAS THAT?

19:39.511 --> 19:41.597
SSH!!

19:42.890 --> 19:45.684
HIDE!

20:20.093 --> 20:25.349
AH, SO LITTLE LEFT.

20:33.607 --> 20:38.278
TO LIFE!
