There was a mass shooting.

Three people are dead.

01:05.729 --> 01:08.030
Wait, what? Oh, my God, Jerrod.

01:08.031 --> 01:09.606
No, no, no, don't freak out, Maxine.

01:09.607 --> 01:11.467

I like that "tap, tap, tap."

01:11.468 --> 01:12.535
No, Jerrod, stop, stop.

01:12.536 --> 01:14.637

01:36.609 --> 01:38.696
Oh, my God, you were in a mall shooting?

01:38.697 --> 01:39.964
Wh-What happened? Are you okay? Wha...

01:39.965 --> 01:42.496
Maxine, let's not make a
big deal about this, okay?

01:42.497 --> 01:44.278
This is an extremely big deal.

01:44.279 --> 01:45.946
No, no, these things happen, okay?

01:45.947 --> 01:48.282
Unfortunately, this is
the society we live in.

01:48.283 --> 01:50.885
Some places are just shoot-up-able.

01:50.886 --> 01:53.086
"Shoot-up-able"? Jerrod, I
don't want to hear you explain

01:53.087 --> 01:55.819
- any of your stupid theories right now.
- See, a shoot-up-able place

01:55.820 --> 01:58.125
is one that makes you feel nervous.

01:58.126 --> 02:00.861
You ever been somewhere with a
large crowd and little security

02:00.862 --> 02:02.496
and you had this feeling
in the pit of your stomach

02:02.497 --> 02:04.832
that something could
go down at any moment?

02:04.833 --> 02:06.333
You know, like, at the airport or, like,

02:06.334 --> 02:08.902
a train station, or, like, a concert,

02:08.904 --> 02:12.907
or, or, maybe, like, the quad
of a liberal arts college.

02:12.908 --> 02:14.208
It's the reason

02:15.377 --> 02:17.711
you and I never go to the movies
at 8:00 p.m. on a Friday night.

02:17.712 --> 02:20.581
Like, I will go to the movies
at 11:00 a.m. Monday morning

02:20.582 --> 02:21.715
when it's safe.

02:23.418 --> 02:24.819
Oh, my God, Jerrod, you alive.

02:24.820 --> 02:26.120
Oh, my God.

02:26.121 --> 02:27.388
- Yes!
- Yeah.

02:27.389 --> 02:31.158
Oh, you're alive 'cause you lived.

02:31.159 --> 02:33.327
Oh, my God, you could've been dead.

02:33.328 --> 02:35.062
But you're not, because you are alive.

02:35.063 --> 02:36.197
Yeah, yeah.

02:36.198 --> 02:37.698
Come on, man, hug me back.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.633
No, Bobby, how did you
even know I was at the mall?

02:39.634 --> 02:41.068
Look, Jesus from PacSun told me.

02:41.069 --> 02:42.503
I don't know who that is.

02:42.504 --> 02:44.238
Remember Jesus that used
to work at Dunkin' Donuts?

02:44.239 --> 02:45.439
- Yeah.
- Well, he work at PacSun now.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.507
Oh.

02:46.508 --> 02:49.020
Jerrod, come sit down. Are you okay?

02:49.021 --> 02:50.778
I don't need to sit down, Maxine.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.146
Well, look, I got to sit down.

02:53.415 --> 02:55.082
Do you know how scary it is

02:55.083 --> 02:56.750
to get a text that say your baby brother

02:56.751 --> 02:58.385
is caught in a mall shooting?

02:58.386 --> 03:02.323
Probably not as scary as being
caught in that mall shooting.

03:02.324 --> 03:05.092
I don't think so. Those
bullets missed you,

03:05.093 --> 03:08.662
but that text message went
straight through my heart.

03:08.663 --> 03:10.865
I can't believe this is real.
Jerrod, tell me what happened.

03:10.866 --> 03:13.601
Uh, I heard gunshots,
I hid behind a kiosk,

03:13.602 --> 03:15.970
and other people started
running and I ran, too.

03:15.971 --> 03:19.139
I know it sounds scary,
but I'm fine, I'm safe.

03:19.141 --> 03:20.908
God, this is crazy.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.177
Okay, well, let me,
let me take care of you.

03:23.178 --> 03:25.813
You need to relax, I will
make you some ginger tea

03:25.814 --> 03:27.882
and then we can, we
can talk all about it.

03:27.883 --> 03:29.950
Maxine, you don't have
to make me any tea.

03:29.951 --> 03:31.452
And really, there's
nothing to talk about.

03:31.453 --> 03:32.686
I've already told you everything.

03:32.687 --> 03:34.722
Well, I'll take some tea, Maxine.

03:34.723 --> 03:36.323
I got a lot to talk about.

03:37.826 --> 03:39.960
Look, Jerrod, I know I
don't express myself often.

03:39.961 --> 03:42.796
You do nothing but express yourself.

03:42.797 --> 03:45.399
Well, I'm about to do it
even more right now, okay?

03:45.400 --> 03:47.401
You mean everything to me, brother.

03:47.402 --> 03:48.669
No, no, hey, look at me.

03:48.670 --> 03:50.170
Look in my eyes.

03:50.172 --> 03:51.438
All right. Be in this moment.

03:51.439 --> 03:52.473
All right.

03:52.474 --> 03:54.742
Everything.

03:54.743 --> 03:58.078
Bobby, you're making
being alive less enjoyable.

03:58.079 --> 04:01.348
Look, man, when I got the
news, I was really nervous.

04:01.349 --> 04:02.516
Shoot.

04:02.517 --> 04:04.552
I took three Vicodin.

04:04.553 --> 04:06.387
Bobby, where are you
getting this Vicodin?

04:06.388 --> 04:08.355
Okay, let's not get overly dramatic.

04:08.356 --> 04:09.757
- My baby!
- Oh, my God.

04:12.027 --> 04:15.062
The Angel of Death tried to take my son,

04:15.063 --> 04:17.398
but my God said "Not today"!

04:17.399 --> 04:20.034
Your life was spared.

04:20.035 --> 04:23.103
Oh, the blessings of
Abraham are upon you.

04:23.104 --> 04:26.006
Ma, Ma.

04:26.007 --> 04:29.143
Oh. Your father called and
said, "Our son is at the mall.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.244
There's been a shooting."

04:30.245 --> 04:31.679
But he started cutting out

04:31.680 --> 04:33.614
before he could tell me which son.

04:33.615 --> 04:37.818
Then my mind started
playing Sophie's Choice.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.054
And I said to myself,

04:40.055 --> 04:43.757
I said, "Lord, if I've
got to lose one of my sons,

04:43.758 --> 04:45.059
please, let it be..." Oh!

04:45.060 --> 04:46.160
Bobby.

04:48.029 --> 04:51.732
I didn't see you standing there.

04:51.733 --> 04:53.901
Wait, Mama, can you finish that sentence?

04:53.902 --> 04:55.603
But, Ma,

04:55.604 --> 04:56.804
don't worry, I'm fine.

04:56.805 --> 04:59.440
No, no, you are not.

04:59.441 --> 05:01.675
But you will be, because I'm here.

05:01.676 --> 05:07.414
I mean, in a time of distress,
a mother is a son's Red Cross.

05:07.415 --> 05:10.784
And I got you your
favorite snacks: Dunk-a-Roos

05:10.785 --> 05:14.288
and Strawberry Nesquik.

05:14.289 --> 05:16.257
Ma, these are great,

05:16.258 --> 05:18.659
if I were in a mass
shooting in the fifth grade.

05:18.660 --> 05:21.295
Now, look, I appreciate
everyone's overreaction here,

05:21.296 --> 05:23.097
but you guys can go, I'm fine.

05:23.098 --> 05:25.399
How dare you almost run out
there and get yourself killed.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.001
- Come here, boy.
- Okay, Dad,

05:27.002 --> 05:28.102
All right.

05:28.103 --> 05:30.170
Do you have any idea

05:30.171 --> 05:32.573
how hard life can be
for a grieving parent?

05:32.574 --> 05:34.341
We'd have to light candles,

05:34.342 --> 05:37.044
dedicate ourselves to anti-gun causes,

05:37.045 --> 05:40.314
start a foundation, speak
to community leaders,

05:40.315 --> 05:42.016
try and get a Jerrod law passed.

05:42.017 --> 05:43.751
You almost ruined our lives.

05:43.752 --> 05:46.987
Just thinking about
living the rest of my life

05:46.988 --> 05:48.022
without my one and only...

05:48.023 --> 05:50.824
Oh, hey, Bobby.

05:50.825 --> 05:53.627
I didn't see you standing there.

05:53.628 --> 05:54.862
How are y'all not seeing me?

05:54.863 --> 05:57.798
Is it the camouflage?

05:57.799 --> 05:59.412
Here you go, Jerrod,
there's your Nesquik.

05:59.413 --> 06:00.501
Thanks, Ma.

06:00.502 --> 06:01.502
Can I have some?

06:01.503 --> 06:02.536
I'm sorry,

06:02.537 --> 06:04.171
what mass shooting were you in?

06:04.172 --> 06:06.407
All right, Jerrod.

06:06.408 --> 06:09.529
I'm gonna draw you a nice, warm bath.

06:09.530 --> 06:11.812
Uh, Maxine, where y'all
keep y'all Epsom salts?

06:11.813 --> 06:14.381
Yeah, you're not gonna bathe
your adult son in my apartment.

06:14.382 --> 06:15.716
Oh. Eh.

06:15.717 --> 06:17.818
Jerrod what were you
thinking, going to a mall

06:17.819 --> 06:20.821
at 2:30 on a Saturday
like some damn hero?

06:22.557 --> 06:26.727
You know good and well
that's ISIS happy hour.

06:26.728 --> 06:28.262
But Joe, Joe, you
don't know who did this.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.230
Oh, come on, Maxine.

06:30.231 --> 06:31.565
You know there's only three options

06:31.566 --> 06:34.101
for any random mass shooting.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.470
ISIS, racist white,

06:36.471 --> 06:40.708
Asian pushed to the
brink by his tiger mom.

06:40.709 --> 06:44.311
That's why I didn't
push you boys in school.

06:44.312 --> 06:47.080
A "D" is still a passing grade.

06:48.516 --> 06:50.317
But, but see, he should've known better.

06:50.318 --> 06:51.728
Wait, are you really blaming Jerrod

06:51.729 --> 06:52.886
for just going to the mall?

06:52.887 --> 06:54.922
Well, who we supposed
to blame? The shooter?

06:54.923 --> 06:56.490
The NRA?

06:56.491 --> 06:59.860
The Republicans for blocking
sensible gun legislation

06:59.861 --> 07:02.129
time and time again?

07:02.130 --> 07:04.365
Those all sound like valid places

07:04.366 --> 07:05.733
to start placing blame.

07:05.734 --> 07:07.868
Oh, pishposh, Maxine.

07:07.869 --> 07:11.839
Jerrod rolled the dice and he
almost got himself massacred.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.240
Okay.

07:13.241 --> 07:14.942
It was just a random thing.

07:14.943 --> 07:17.111
Let's not put any more onto this.

07:17.112 --> 07:18.746
Yeah, hold up for a second.

07:18.747 --> 07:21.014
Something just came to me.

07:21.015 --> 07:23.851
I texted Jerrod yesterday to
see if he wanted to hang out.

07:23.852 --> 07:25.386
He never texted me back.

07:25.387 --> 07:26.854
But what if he did?

07:26.855 --> 07:28.355
I would've been at that mall, too.

07:28.356 --> 07:30.858
That's crazy, right?
I could have been dead.

07:30.859 --> 07:33.994
Bobby, that's not that
crazy. I rarely text you back.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.929
But what if you did?

07:35.930 --> 07:37.464
Well, he's got a point now.

07:37.465 --> 07:39.233
If Jerrod would have
thought you'd have been

07:39.234 --> 07:42.603
more fun to hang out
with, you could be dead.

07:42.604 --> 07:44.271
You're right, Bobby, that's scary.

07:44.272 --> 07:46.073
Go ahead, make yourself some Nesquik.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.308
Oh, no, no. Don't.

07:48.309 --> 07:50.744
Don't encourage him to be the victim.

07:50.745 --> 07:52.646
You know, for every person who actually

07:52.647 --> 07:55.382
experiences a tragedy, he's
got seven distant cousins

07:55.383 --> 07:57.451
trying to make it about them on Facebook.

07:57.452 --> 07:59.553
Hey, Bobby, I understand
what you're going through,

07:59.554 --> 08:02.189
but we need to remember that
Jerrod is the victim here.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.291
No, no, no, no. I am not a victim.

08:04.292 --> 08:06.226
In fact, I'm the opposite of a victim.

08:06.227 --> 08:08.529
I'm a guy who was lucky
enough to make it out.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.098
No, Jerrod, there's nothing
wrong with accepting the fact

08:11.099 --> 08:12.566
that you might be a victim.

08:12.567 --> 08:15.035
It is the first step in
processing what happened

08:15.036 --> 08:17.004
and accepting that you
might need some help

08:17.005 --> 08:18.405
from the people who love you.

08:18.406 --> 08:19.873
Well, know, Jerrod,

08:19.874 --> 08:21.975
that I am your mother and I love you

08:21.976 --> 08:24.044
more than any of these people.

08:26.314 --> 08:27.347
Well, I don't know, Mama.

08:27.348 --> 08:29.316
Jerrod is getting a lot
of love on Instagram.

08:29.317 --> 08:30.818
Damn it, Bobby, you posted this?

08:30.819 --> 08:31.885
Of course I did.

08:32.754 --> 08:34.188
Near-death experiences...

08:34.188 --> 08:36.155
get you the most likes on social media.

08:36.157 --> 08:39.893
Look, I know being a victim

08:39.894 --> 08:41.428
is real sexy right now, all right?

08:41.429 --> 08:43.429
But I don't want to be one of those guys

08:43.431 --> 08:45.566
who posts every sad thing
about them on Instagram

08:45.567 --> 08:47.167
just to see how many people care.

08:47.168 --> 08:47.968
Ninety-three.

08:49.270 --> 08:51.605
93 people care about you, Jerrod.

08:51.606 --> 08:54.374
Oh, wait a minute.

08:54.375 --> 08:56.710
Now it's down to 92.

08:56.711 --> 08:59.413
Who would un-like somebody
that survived a shooting?

08:59.414 --> 09:02.082
Just untag me, Bobby.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.684
I don't want to be defined by this.

09:03.685 --> 09:05.619
I don't want my whole identity to be

09:05.620 --> 09:07.554
"guy who survived the mall shooting."

09:07.555 --> 09:10.724
Man, Jerrod, you get all the breaks.

09:10.725 --> 09:12.559
They just handed you an identity.

09:12.560 --> 09:16.330
I've been trying to find
my identity for 32 years.

09:16.331 --> 09:18.365
Bobby, you have an identity.

09:18.366 --> 09:21.468
You are the guy with the cool hats.

09:22.971 --> 09:24.905
I know everybody say
that when they see you.

09:24.906 --> 09:28.342
They say, "Here come Bobby.
He got the best hats."

09:28.343 --> 09:30.143
But is that enough, Mama?

09:30.144 --> 09:31.979
No, it is not, son.

09:31.980 --> 09:35.148
I heard somebody saw
their first shooting today.

09:36.951 --> 09:40.153
Nekeisha, let's not make a
big deal about this, okay?

09:40.154 --> 09:41.622
It is a big deal.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.790
You got your shootout cherry popped.

09:45.159 --> 09:46.827
Now, the first time is scary.

09:46.828 --> 09:48.996
I remember I was all afraid, thinking,

09:48.997 --> 09:51.198
"Oh, my God, this could
be my last moment."

09:51.199 --> 09:52.866
But, now when I hear gunshots,

09:52.867 --> 09:55.602
I'm like "Ooh, somebody mad."

09:59.674 --> 10:02.476
Look at it this way, son:
this might be good for you.

10:02.477 --> 10:03.544
Really?

10:03.545 --> 10:04.344
Well, don't get me wrong.

10:04.345 --> 10:05.913
This mall shooting will haunt you

10:05.914 --> 10:07.514
all the days of your life.

10:07.515 --> 10:08.912
I'm, I'm sorry, "haunt me"?

10:08.929 --> 10:10.715
Well, yeah, but I mean,
that might be a good thing.

10:10.716 --> 10:12.319
We all need to be haunted a little bit.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.921
It builds character.

10:13.922 --> 10:15.489
That's what makes you a man.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.558
I had an abusive, alcoholic father.

10:17.559 --> 10:18.859
That haunts me every night.

10:18.860 --> 10:20.460
That's my thing.

10:20.461 --> 10:22.824
Now you got this, and it's your thing.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.283
Hey, Daddy, can this be my thing, too?

10:25.284 --> 10:26.466
Hey, Bobby, Bobby.

10:26.467 --> 10:28.168
It's your brother's thing.

10:28.970 --> 10:30.537
Now, some massive tragedy's

10:30.538 --> 10:31.672
gonna strike you soon enough.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.173
Just be patient.

10:36.044 --> 10:38.512
That's why I coddled you boys so,

10:38.513 --> 10:42.416
because I didn't want you to
end up haunted like your father.

10:42.417 --> 10:45.218
Sometimes, at night, when
I look out the window,

10:45.219 --> 10:47.988
he's just out there, sitting on the lawn,

10:47.989 --> 10:50.190
looking up at the moon.

10:51.426 --> 10:54.327
Joe, you know, if you ever need
to talk to someone, I'm here.

10:54.329 --> 10:57.431
Why would I talk to
you when I got the moon?

10:57.432 --> 10:59.733
You think you wiser
than the moon, Maxine?

10:59.734 --> 11:01.134
All right, you know what?

11:01.135 --> 11:02.302
Everybody, let's go.

11:02.303 --> 11:03.637
I think this is over. Just...

11:03.638 --> 11:05.105
Wait, wait a minute, Jerrod.

11:05.106 --> 11:06.339
I-Is that blood?

11:06.341 --> 11:08.642
Wait, oh, my God, you were close enough

11:08.643 --> 11:09.743
to the shooting to get blood on you?

11:09.744 --> 11:11.144
Is that true?

11:11.145 --> 11:12.346
Okay, you know what?
If you guys won't leave,

11:12.347 --> 11:14.247
then I guess I will.

11:14.248 --> 11:16.984
Congratulations on kicking a
man out of his own apartment,

11:16.985 --> 11:20.621
especially on a day when all he
really needed was to be alone.

11:20.622 --> 11:22.723
I don't know where he going;

11:22.724 --> 11:25.959
the moon don't come out till 7:42.

11:34.548 --> 11:36.115
Jerrod.

11:36.116 --> 11:38.284
Look, I know that this isn't easy,

11:38.285 --> 11:40.987
but you need to deal with this.

11:40.988 --> 11:42.989
I am. I'm trying to get this stain out.

11:42.990 --> 11:44.056
Okay, stop.

11:44.057 --> 11:46.592
It's okay to open up.

11:46.593 --> 11:48.961
I'm here for you, whatever you need.

11:48.962 --> 11:51.464
Thanks, Maxine.

11:55.469 --> 11:57.503
Whoa. Oh, okay.

11:57.504 --> 11:58.905
Um, what's going, what's going on?

11:58.906 --> 12:00.773
Hey, hey, hey, let's do
it in the laundry room.

12:00.774 --> 12:02.708
You know that's always
been one of our fantasies.

12:02.709 --> 12:04.810
What, that is so not true.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.746
Um, someone could see
us, that's a glass door.

12:06.747 --> 12:08.748
You... there's someone's
blood on your sweatshirt.

12:08.749 --> 12:10.850
No, you're using the wrong tone.

12:10.851 --> 12:12.718
Someone could see us.

12:12.719 --> 12:13.719
There's a glass door,

12:14.621 --> 12:16.189
and I got someone's
blood on my sweatshirt.

12:16.190 --> 12:17.189
Okay, Jerrod, stop.

12:17.991 --> 12:19.825
You can't use sex to hide your feelings.

12:19.826 --> 12:22.461
Now, why won't you be honest
with us about what you saw?

12:22.462 --> 12:24.297
Oh.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.768
Oh, hey, guys.

12:28.769 --> 12:31.337
Oh, Jerrod.

12:31.338 --> 12:33.206
I'm so glad I ran into you.

12:33.207 --> 12:34.674
I saw your brother's post

12:34.675 --> 12:36.742
about what you went through at the mall.

12:36.743 --> 12:40.246
No, no, I'm... I'm fine, Monica.

12:40.247 --> 12:41.681
Really, I'm fine.

12:41.682 --> 12:44.050
Listen, I just want
to tell you something.

12:44.051 --> 12:46.552
I know exactly what you're going through.

12:46.553 --> 12:49.055
I survived the biggest attack

12:49.056 --> 12:51.290
that ever hit American soil.

12:51.291 --> 12:52.792
9/11.

12:52.793 --> 12:54.293
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, Monica,

12:54.294 --> 12:56.062
I had no idea you were near Ground Zero.

12:56.063 --> 12:58.331
Well, no. Not... Not quite.

12:58.332 --> 13:01.467
But I was living in Queens at the time.

13:01.468 --> 13:04.270
Oh, well, Queens is a
pretty safe distance away

13:04.271 --> 13:05.805
from where the towers were, right?

13:05.806 --> 13:06.906
Well, you'd be surprised.

13:06.907 --> 13:09.141
New York is a small city.

13:09.943 --> 13:13.679
Is it?

13:13.680 --> 13:15.648
You know, at times like this,

13:15.649 --> 13:17.316
people want to support you

13:17.317 --> 13:19.485
and-and make sure that you're okay,

13:19.486 --> 13:22.955
but it's important that you
know you are not a victim.

13:22.956 --> 13:25.091
Thank you. Thank you very much, Monica.

13:25.092 --> 13:26.792
I've been trying to tell
my family that all day,

13:26.793 --> 13:29.095
but no one will listen.
No, you're not a victim.

13:29.096 --> 13:31.831
You're a survivor, like me.

13:33.033 --> 13:34.567
Stay strong.

13:34.568 --> 13:36.502
You know, take care of you.

13:36.503 --> 13:38.904
Take care of your mind.

13:38.905 --> 13:41.073
Take care of your spirit.

13:41.074 --> 13:43.643
Take care of the earth.

13:43.644 --> 13:44.744
Take care of the...

13:44.745 --> 13:46.012
Ah, see, I'm forgetting something.

13:46.013 --> 13:47.280
Did I say spirit?

13:47.281 --> 13:48.681
- Yeah.
- Okay, then.

13:48.682 --> 13:50.916
There you are, Jerrod.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.752
There's a cop upstairs looking for you.

13:52.753 --> 13:54.320
What? What are you talking about?

13:54.321 --> 13:55.620
Look, they saw my Facebook post,

13:55.621 --> 13:57.657
and they're questioning,
like, witnesses of the crime.

13:57.658 --> 13:59.458
Damn it, Bobby.

13:59.459 --> 14:01.093
Hey, Monica.

14:01.094 --> 14:04.163
How you been holding up since 9/11?

14:05.999 --> 14:10.102
Oh, you know, I count
each breath as a gift.

14:10.904 --> 14:12.505
Never forget.

14:12.506 --> 14:14.340
All right, come on, Bobby.

14:15.309 --> 14:17.943
The Jerrod you knew is gone.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.378
A new flower has emerged.

14:19.379 --> 14:22.114
- Okay.
- Okay, all right.

14:23.250 --> 14:25.151
I know your job is to protect and serve,

14:25.152 --> 14:27.119
but it's hard not to
feel a little nervous

14:27.120 --> 14:29.288
when you in the room.

14:29.289 --> 14:30.690
You're not a suspect of any crime, sir.

14:30.691 --> 14:32.191
There's no reason to feel nervous.

14:32.192 --> 14:33.459
I'm just here to talk to your son.

14:33.460 --> 14:37.062
Well, I feel like we
should put our hands up.

14:38.098 --> 14:39.999
Joe, should we put our hands up?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.268
Honey, that's a good idea.

14:42.269 --> 14:44.303
As a safety precaution, Officer,

14:44.304 --> 14:46.906
we are now lifting our
hands up into the air.

14:46.907 --> 14:48.274
No sudden movements now.

14:48.275 --> 14:51.444
We got to treat these
officers like bears.

14:51.445 --> 14:53.546
I'm taping this,

14:53.547 --> 14:55.648
just so you know.

14:57.918 --> 15:00.553
If you shoot anyone, you
probably will keep your job,

15:00.554 --> 15:03.622
but it's gonna be a
rough couple of weeks.

15:04.925 --> 15:07.760
You're, obviously, free
to do what you want,

15:07.761 --> 15:09.895
but that is extremely unnecessary.

15:09.896 --> 15:14.500
We are here with Officer G. Zimmerman.

15:16.470 --> 15:18.371
I-It's Greg. There's no relation.

15:18.372 --> 15:19.972
It's, it's a common last name.

15:19.973 --> 15:23.742
We're here with George
Zimmerman's brother, Greg.

15:25.512 --> 15:27.246
Whoa, what's going on in here?

15:27.247 --> 15:28.581
Do we have to have our hands up?

15:28.582 --> 15:30.549
No, you'll be fine, Maxine.

15:30.550 --> 15:32.318
Somebody shoot Maxine,

15:32.319 --> 15:35.588
they'll close the whole police station.

15:35.589 --> 15:37.523
There's no reason to raise your hands.

15:37.524 --> 15:39.325
I'm just here to ask a couple questions.

15:39.326 --> 15:41.360
Are you Jerrod Carmichael?

15:41.361 --> 15:42.628
Yes.

15:42.629 --> 15:44.230
Here, uh, listen.

15:44.231 --> 15:46.232
I'm sure you've had a-a tough day,

15:46.233 --> 15:48.300
but any information
you have could help us

15:48.301 --> 15:50.102
put the pieces of what happened together.

15:50.103 --> 15:51.303
I mean, do you mind describing

15:51.304 --> 15:53.038
what you saw at the mall earlier?

15:53.039 --> 15:55.408
Uh, yeah, I-I heard gunshots,

15:55.409 --> 15:57.476
then I ran and hid behind a kiosk,

15:57.477 --> 16:00.279
and then, uh, I ran out of the mall.

16:00.280 --> 16:02.581
Sir, I-I'm going to need you to be

16:02.582 --> 16:04.550
as specific as possible.

16:04.551 --> 16:06.552
Could you start with
where you were standing

16:06.553 --> 16:08.387
when you heard the gunshots?

16:08.388 --> 16:09.889
Uh, okay.

16:09.890 --> 16:11.323
Um, yeah.

16:11.324 --> 16:14.026
I was, I was in line

16:14.027 --> 16:15.661
waiting to get a pretzel,

16:15.662 --> 16:18.230
and I was behind this
guy and his girlfriend,

16:18.231 --> 16:20.099
and they were taking a while.

16:20.100 --> 16:21.834
They didn't know what they wanted,

16:21.835 --> 16:23.736
and so he turned and
looked at me and was like,

16:23.737 --> 16:26.138
"Oh, this looks like a man who
knows exactly what he wants."

16:26.139 --> 16:28.007
And he let me cut in front of him,

16:28.008 --> 16:31.644
and, uh, and that's when
I heard the first shots.

16:31.645 --> 16:33.879
They... I don't know where
they were coming from.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.915
They sounded really close,

16:35.916 --> 16:39.552
and so I ran and I hid behind the kiosk.

16:39.553 --> 16:42.121
And then, like, more shots came,

16:42.122 --> 16:43.823
and I was trying to find the gunman,

16:43.824 --> 16:45.524
but I-I couldn't tell where he was.

16:45.525 --> 16:47.660
It was, like, just a lot of chaos.

16:47.661 --> 16:50.296
And so then I looked
and I saw the-the guy

16:50.297 --> 16:52.398
who let me in front of him.

16:52.399 --> 16:55.267
Um, he'd been shot.

16:55.268 --> 16:58.537
And his girlfriend was
just standing over him,

16:58.538 --> 17:01.273
like, in shock.

17:01.274 --> 17:05.711
It's like, she looked really confused.

17:08.348 --> 17:11.817
And then everybody just ran out.

17:16.056 --> 17:19.358
So if it wasn't for that
dude letting you cut in line,

17:19.358 --> 17:23.194
you would have been standing
exactly where he got shot at?

17:23.195 --> 17:25.464
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

17:25.464 --> 17:27.633
I-I don't know if he lived or died.

17:27.634 --> 17:29.535
Jerrod.

17:29.536 --> 17:30.603
Oh, my baby.

17:30.604 --> 17:31.937
Officer,

17:31.938 --> 17:34.073
we are going to take approximately seven

17:34.074 --> 17:36.208
to eight steps toward our
son in order to hug him.

17:43.283 --> 17:44.950
Uh...

17:47.354 --> 17:48.770
Listen, uh...

17:49.459 --> 17:52.258
Sir, you-you've clearly
been through a lot.

17:52.259 --> 17:54.193
I'm-I'm gonna leave,
but if you don't mind,

17:54.194 --> 17:56.829
I might need, uh, to contact
you for more questioning.

17:56.830 --> 17:58.197
Yeah, that's fine.

17:58.198 --> 18:01.200
Okay, well, uh, you all take care.

18:03.537 --> 18:05.471
I'm gonna follow him down to the car.

18:05.472 --> 18:07.906
We're not letting no
more Zimmermans get away.

18:11.077 --> 18:13.112
Oh, God, Jerrod, I'm so
sorry you saw all that.

18:13.113 --> 18:14.813
But at least now you can admit

18:14.814 --> 18:16.916
that you were affected by this shooting.

18:16.917 --> 18:18.784
Yeah, no, you're right, Maxine.

18:18.785 --> 18:20.786
I am a victim.

18:20.787 --> 18:22.721
Well, saying that's a good thing.

18:22.722 --> 18:24.557
Acknowledging the
reality of your feelings

18:24.558 --> 18:26.025
is incredibly hard,

18:26.026 --> 18:28.560
but it's the first step to healing.

18:28.562 --> 18:31.497
How is that possibly a good thing?

18:31.498 --> 18:33.499
I mean, all that proves
is that I have no control

18:33.500 --> 18:35.167
over my life whatsoever.

18:35.168 --> 18:38.637
It just proves that life is
this endless cycle of death.

18:38.638 --> 18:41.440
It just proves that one moment
you can be standing in line,

18:41.441 --> 18:43.175
trying to get a salted pretzel,

18:43.176 --> 18:46.724
and the next you're
choking on your own blood.

18:46.725 --> 18:49.315
Why feel anything?

18:49.316 --> 18:51.517
Does anything matter?

18:53.520 --> 18:56.855
Ooh, look at the time. It's almost 6:30.

18:56.856 --> 18:58.524
We better get on home.

18:58.525 --> 19:00.025
Jerrod,

19:00.026 --> 19:02.194
you are asking

19:02.195 --> 19:05.497
the most profound
questions a man can ask.

19:05.498 --> 19:07.232
About life.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.234
About meaning.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.070
And, well...

19:11.071 --> 19:13.105
your father's right, we'd
better get out of here.

19:13.106 --> 19:15.841
Come on. We love you.

19:15.842 --> 19:17.476
Ooh, it got dark in here quick.

19:17.477 --> 19:19.044
- Didn't it, Cynthia?
- Oh, yeah.

19:19.045 --> 19:21.113
Maxine got a lot of
pieces to put together.

19:21.114 --> 19:22.848
I'll tell you that.

19:29.789 --> 19:32.357
You're not gonna eat
these Dunk-a-Roos, are you?

19:39.165 --> 19:42.101
Um, uh, y-you want some space?

19:42.102 --> 19:44.203
Nah, come sit with me.

19:57.651 --> 19:58.984
Maxine,

19:58.985 --> 20:00.719
are you trying to have sex right now?

20:02.422 --> 20:04.356
There's just something about
seeing you so vulnerable

20:04.357 --> 20:05.958
and emotional.

20:05.959 --> 20:07.526
You think you could cry during...?

20:07.527 --> 20:08.794
Okay, Maxine, you are sick.

20:11.131 --> 20:13.732
If you promise to cry, we
can do it in the laundry room.

20:16.447 --> 20:19.582
Did they name the shooter yet?

20:19.583 --> 20:20.817
Yeah, it's a 29-year-old woman

20:20.818 --> 20:23.186
born and raised in the United States.

20:23.187 --> 20:25.021
A woman shooter.

20:25.022 --> 20:28.258
Does that count as progress, Maxine?

20:28.259 --> 20:30.293
No, Cynthia, this is not progress.

20:30.294 --> 20:32.095
I don't know. After Hillary, I think

20:32.096 --> 20:34.696
we should take every win we can get.

20:43.039 --> 20:44.974
What?

20:44.975 --> 20:46.776
What?

20:46.777 --> 20:49.212
Jerrod, you almost got shot by a girl.

20:51.048 --> 20:52.615
How could she hold a gun

20:52.616 --> 20:56.319
'cause she was holding
all them shopping bags?

20:56.320 --> 20:57.954
All right.

20:57.955 --> 21:00.723
I'm gonna go stare at the moon.

21:03.419 --> 21:10.789
