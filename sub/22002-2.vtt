00:02.126 --> 00:03.791
So, I got assigned to this one rookie,

00:03.849 --> 00:05.296
and on his training day,

00:05.354 --> 00:08.108
I made him smoke angel dust
at gunpoint.

00:08.544 --> 00:11.786
King Kong ain't got
nothing on me.

00:11.844 --> 00:13.344
Isn't that the plot
and tagline of...

00:13.402 --> 00:15.494
The movie "Training Day"?
Yes, great observation, Tank.

00:15.551 --> 00:16.869
That's because it's based on
my life.

00:16.926 --> 00:19.087
Lunch is over.
Bus your trays.

00:20.136 --> 00:21.876
- Now, Peralta.
- I haven't finished

00:21.948 --> 00:24.803
- my lemon cookie, bull.
- And you're not gonna get to,

00:24.861 --> 00:26.099
either. Give it to me.

00:26.157 --> 00:27.700
Oh, you want the cookie?

00:30.237 --> 00:31.792
- Oh!
- There's your cookie.

00:31.850 --> 00:33.927
- You're going in the hole.
- Oh, I'm going in the hole?

00:33.984 --> 00:35.319
- Yeah.
- Yeah, bring it on!

00:35.377 --> 00:37.046
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

00:37.103 --> 00:38.472
Remember what you saw here today!

00:39.577 --> 00:40.722
You can lock me up,

00:40.749 --> 00:42.089
but one day
I'll get out of here,

00:42.147 --> 00:44.412
and I'll come for you!
I'll come for all of you!

00:44.470 --> 00:45.533
Hey, Warden. What's up?

00:45.591 --> 00:46.724
Next time, don't wait so long

00:46.781 --> 00:48.169
to spit the cookie.
I've been waiting

00:48.226 --> 00:50.068
in here for four
minutes, and it's gross.

00:50.126 --> 00:52.158
- Yeah, it really is.
- Okay, snitch time.

00:52.216 --> 00:54.118
- What's up with Romero?
- All right, he's got

00:54.176 --> 00:56.276
a "delivery" coming in
on Wednesday night.

00:56.334 --> 00:58.505
One of the cafeteria workers
is smuggling something in

00:58.563 --> 01:00.539
- with the produce.
- Great.

01:00.699 --> 01:02.517
- See you Thursday.
- Wait, what?

01:02.575 --> 01:04.486
You're just gonna leave
me in here, in solitary?

01:04.545 --> 01:07.369
You spit in a guard's face.
That's five days in the hole.

01:07.427 --> 01:09.229
Yeah, but, I mean,
you made me do that.

01:09.287 --> 01:11.356
Well, we don't want anybody
getting suspicious, huh?

01:11.430 --> 01:12.596
Have fun.

01:15.310 --> 01:16.845
Try not to go crazy.

01:20.882 --> 01:23.447
Okay.
No big deal.

01:23.644 --> 01:25.648
Five days is nothing.
I'm not afraid to be alone

01:25.706 --> 01:27.205
with my thoughts. My
thoughts are awesome.

01:27.262 --> 01:29.478
"Die Hard 6" on a cruise ship,
pizza bagel restaurant,

01:29.551 --> 01:31.755
my father never loved me, I'm
gonna die alone... oh, boy,

01:31.812 --> 01:33.748
that happened fast.

02:31.655 --> 02:33.047
My name is Seamus Murphy.

I know your boyfriend got framed.

02:43.130 --> 02:44.393

to the robberies.
I could tell you

02:50.650 --> 02:52.703
- how to find them.
- Why would you do that?

02:52.882 --> 02:55.389

stint in solitary?

03:16.515 --> 03:18.088
It was nothing.
I held it together.

03:18.255 --> 03:20.718
Oh... Amy.

03:20.776 --> 03:22.178
When'd you get here?

03:22.271 --> 03:26.231
You've come for my

No matter.
I'll just build another one.

03:34.076 --> 03:37.348
More mashed potatoes!

03:37.432 --> 03:40.069
So, what happened with that
sweet intel I gave you?

03:40.136 --> 03:43.242
Your tip was garbage. We
busted Romero's delivery.

03:43.404 --> 03:45.879
Get this...
nothing but toothbrushes,

03:45.937 --> 03:49.595
- shampoo, and soap.
- Ooh, lemon verbena.

03:49.653 --> 03:51.395
- Can I keep this?
- Yes, you should... you reek.

03:51.452 --> 03:52.521

- Yeah, the drug, right?

03:54.271 --> 03:55.936
Uh-huh.
And thanks to your pal Romero,

03:55.994 --> 03:58.582
it's taking over the prison.
I need you to find out

03:58.697 --> 04:00.624
- where he keeps his stash.
- Well,

04:00.701 --> 04:02.943
I doubt he would tell me that.
I'm not exactly

04:03.001 --> 04:04.511
- in the inner circle.
- Maybe you just need

04:04.568 --> 04:07.240
some extra incentive.
Find the stash,

04:07.298 --> 04:09.053
or I'll tell everybody
you're a snitch.

04:09.111 --> 04:11.326
What? No.
They'll kill me.

04:11.413 --> 04:13.273
You don't want that, right?
It'd probably be a lot of

04:13.330 --> 04:14.830
- paperwork for you.
- Oh, it's not.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.791
It's just one form, and
it's already filled out.

04:17.922 --> 04:20.892
We just have to staple a
picture of your corpse to it.

04:21.767 --> 04:24.679
Great.
Prison... is great.

04:26.393 --> 04:28.197
He said I have three days to decide.

04:28.391 --> 04:30.392
We should tread lightly.
Seamus Murphy is the head

04:30.478 --> 04:32.124

Seamus Murphy,

Detective Scully, or
were you having trouble

04:37.035 --> 04:39.400
- with the jumble?
- Oh... the first one.

04:39.510 --> 04:41.281
Murphy didn't ask me to
do anything illegal.

04:41.339 --> 04:42.951
He just wants me
to owe him a favor.

04:43.009 --> 04:44.209
Right, but we don't want to
be indebted

04:44.266 --> 04:45.820

04:45.878 --> 04:47.624
but we've been watching
Hawkins for a month,

04:47.682 --> 04:49.904
and we have nothing to connect
her to the robberies.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.200
Maybe we should
pursue other routes.

05:12.119 --> 05:13.413
people see he was framed.

05:13.471 --> 05:16.146
I build an audience. I get
a celebrity listener.

05:16.259 --> 05:18.617
It's Debra Messing.
She tweets a link.

05:18.675 --> 05:20.755
- Now Sean Hayes is involved.
- Boyle, that's enough.

05:20.823 --> 05:22.836
I know dealing with a
criminal is bad news,

05:22.894 --> 05:25.036
but I can't just let
Jake sit in prison.

05:25.094 --> 05:27.162
Okay, maybe we can figure
out what Murphy knows

05:27.220 --> 05:30.174
without taking his deal.
He says that Hawkins is

05:30.232 --> 05:31.653
moving the diamonds in three days.

05:31.711 --> 05:33.640

06:48.546 --> 06:51.307
Hey, I'm in a bind.
I need your help.

06:51.374 --> 06:53.816
- That's what friends are for.
- Well, "friends" might be

06:53.874 --> 06:54.971
a bit of a stretch.
I mean, you're a cannibal

06:55.029 --> 06:56.580
- that ate six people.
- 9 1/2.

06:56.647 --> 06:58.373
Yup, worse. All right,
here are my options:

06:58.432 --> 07:00.596
A, I keep pestering Romero to
tell me where the drugs are,

07:00.653 --> 07:02.454
he realizes I'm a snitch,
then he castrates me

07:02.512 --> 07:04.179
- and kicks me to death.
- That's not great.

07:04.236 --> 07:06.269
- What's option B?
- I back off Romero, never find

07:06.327 --> 07:07.794
out where the drugs are,
the warden tells everyone

07:07.851 --> 07:10.090
I'm a snitch,
and then Romero castrates me

07:10.148 --> 07:12.377
- and kicks me to death.
- Mm, both options sound...

07:12.435 --> 07:14.538
A little castrate-y?
Yeah, that's what I keep

07:14.596 --> 07:16.474
- bumping up against too.
- Well, you know, whenever

07:16.532 --> 07:18.926
I'm backed into a corner,
I just do what I do best:

07:19.085 --> 07:21.300
I drive across country,
forge a new identity,

07:21.358 --> 07:22.954
and then take a job
as a camp counselor.

07:23.011 --> 07:25.303
Oh, my God. Caleb,
you're a genius.

07:25.370 --> 07:27.172
I wouldn't say genius.
That camp ran

07:27.230 --> 07:28.888
a pretty extensive
background check.

07:28.946 --> 07:30.946
No, not that... your past
is a straight-up nightmare,

07:31.003 --> 07:33.045
but... I need to do "what I do best":

07:33.116 --> 07:34.903
be a cop, work the case,

07:34.961 --> 07:36.577
figure out where the
drugs are on my own.

07:36.635 --> 07:38.436
And you tell the warden,
and the warden will

07:38.494 --> 07:39.966
- bust Romero.
- And Romero won't think

07:40.023 --> 07:41.751
I'm a snitch, because he never
told me where they are.

07:41.808 --> 07:42.930
All right,
this is gonna be tough.

07:42.987 --> 07:44.161
I'm really gonna have
to thread the needle.

07:44.218 --> 07:46.126
Ooh! I got really good
at threading needles.

07:46.184 --> 07:47.783
Back when you were making
your skin suit, I know.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.332
Look, I like being friends
with you, but you have to

07:49.389 --> 07:50.716
- stop bringing that up.
- But we're friends?

07:52.396 --> 07:53.897
<i>Moving $5 million in diamonds</i>

07:53.955 --> 07:55.323
is not an everyday activity,

07:55.390 --> 07:57.260
so Hawkins must be
altering her behavior.

07:57.327 --> 07:58.967
She's not. I've been
tailing her for days.

07:59.031 --> 08:00.905
Scully and I went out
to Flaxton Hill Farms

08:00.963 --> 08:02.883
to watch the guy who
testified for Hawkins.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.406
All he does is feed his pigs.

08:04.473 --> 08:06.009
They eat seven or eight meals
a day...

08:06.076 --> 08:08.573
sometimes by force.
They're living the dream.

08:08.631 --> 08:09.876

08:09.934 --> 08:11.504
- Worth it.

I was double-checking

last month's surveillance photos,

08:15.192 --> 08:16.394
and I noticed this.

08:16.577 --> 08:18.275
Hawkins has two different phones:

08:18.338 --> 08:19.807
her normal cell,
and then this one

08:19.865 --> 08:22.469
that only has one app on the
home screen... Snapchat.

08:22.536 --> 08:25.998
Oh, she's up to something.
Snapchat messages disappear.

08:26.093 --> 08:28.371
You can send anything to anybody,

08:28.429 --> 08:30.773
and after they see it,
it's like I never sent it.

08:30.852 --> 08:32.727
Nobody ask Hitchcock
why he knows that.

08:32.823 --> 08:34.703
Could we put a mirroring
app on her phone

08:34.760 --> 08:36.136
so we could
watch everything she does?

08:36.193 --> 08:38.687
Oh, those work great,
but you have to physically

08:38.806 --> 08:39.980
have her phone to install it.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.173
Nobody ask Hitchcock
why he knows that.

08:42.293 --> 08:43.684
I know
how we can get Hawkins' phone.

08:43.741 --> 08:45.033
We get her to visit prison.

08:45.145 --> 08:46.946
They make you leave
your phone in your car.

08:47.004 --> 08:48.604
I wanted to record Jake for the podcast,

08:48.664 --> 08:50.616
but they said I couldn't.
I had to have Terry on

08:50.674 --> 08:52.358
- as a guest.
- I gave up my Saturday

08:52.425 --> 08:53.727
for that. You said I did great.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.106
I'm the host. I have to say that.

08:55.163 --> 08:56.530
So, all we need to do is get

08:56.597 --> 08:58.435
Hawkins to visit someone in
prison.

08:58.502 --> 09:01.088
No, absolutely not.
What would I even say to her?

09:01.146 --> 09:02.517
Well, perhaps you could
ask her to put in

09:02.574 --> 09:03.887
a good word for you with the warden,

09:03.944 --> 09:05.951
- so you can get extra yard time.
- So, you want me to beg

09:06.008 --> 09:08.041
the woman I hate for mercy.
Cool.

09:08.152 --> 09:10.042
Oh, one problem.
How do I stop myself

09:10.100 --> 09:11.671
from smashing through
the glass and squeezing

09:11.728 --> 09:13.493
the life out of her
with my bare hands?

09:13.560 --> 09:15.809
Maybe you could just imagine
doing that.

09:15.867 --> 09:18.020
It'd be probably just as fun
as actually doing it, right?

09:18.077 --> 09:19.268
- No.
- I'm with Diaz.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.995
Imagination is never the solution.

09:21.152 --> 09:23.741
We just need three minutes
to get inside her car

09:23.899 --> 09:25.648
and install the app.

09:25.965 --> 09:28.285
Okay. I can grovel for three minutes.

09:28.356 --> 09:30.183
- But one second more...
- Yes, yes, we know.

09:30.247 --> 09:32.171
You burst through the glass and
squeeze the life out of her

09:32.228 --> 09:35.467
with your bare hands. Well...
I think we have a plan.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.978
Don't let them see us. Blend in.

09:41.036 --> 09:43.770
I gotta tell you, cop work
is a lot like cannibal work.

09:43.881 --> 09:45.249
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

09:45.316 --> 09:46.944
The watching...

09:47.359 --> 09:49.174
the following...

09:50.686 --> 09:52.951
The waiting for soccer practice
to end.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.571
Come on, man.

09:56.868 --> 09:58.622
Did you see that? Romero just went

09:58.701 --> 10:00.090
into the showers for
the second time today.

10:00.147 --> 10:01.649
Well, maybe he just likes to relax.

10:01.753 --> 10:03.326
No one is relaxed in a prison shower.

10:03.406 --> 10:04.694
It's literally the most tense situation

10:04.751 --> 10:05.779
I've ever been in.

10:05.844 --> 10:07.563
What's he doing in there?

10:07.623 --> 10:09.326
That must be where he stashes the Blizz.

10:09.393 --> 10:11.819
Unless he's just having sex...
no, but he's a huge homophobe.

10:11.907 --> 10:13.018
It's where he stashes the Blizz.

10:13.075 --> 10:14.873
But... all homophobes are secretly gay.

10:14.931 --> 10:15.886
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

10:15.944 --> 10:17.440
We'll check it out later,
when he's done.

10:17.497 --> 10:19.272
Hawkins must be through
security by now.

10:19.330 --> 10:21.170
Rosa promised us three minutes, tops.

10:21.315 --> 10:23.004
We'll get the phone. Captain Holt,

10:23.062 --> 10:24.077
can you distract the lot attendant?

10:24.134 --> 10:25.390
I'm not Captain Holt.

that much meth?

Well, no, no, not meth. Blizz.

15:23.834 --> 15:25.446
Yeah, that's meth.
We just call it Blizz

15:25.504 --> 15:26.853

15:26.910 --> 15:27.956
Oh! Oh, my God,

15:28.014 --> 15:29.251

15:29.309 --> 15:30.935
No, I'm not. I just love it

15:30.993 --> 15:32.973
and I am consumed with the thought
of doing it again.

15:33.030 --> 15:36.117
So, now I know I can trust you, huh?

15:36.403 --> 15:38.666

smuggle in the Blizz.

15:38.724 --> 15:40.319

have to tell me that.

15:40.376 --> 15:42.083

16:20.082 --> 16:22.273
We don't need disguises.
Anyone can be here.

16:22.456 --> 16:23.551
Typical shiksa.

16:23.609 --> 16:24.887
I see movement at the locker.

16:24.954 --> 16:26.725
<i>He's opening 805! Let's go!</i>

16:26.792 --> 16:27.895
NYPD! Get down!

16:27.962 --> 16:29.429
- Down!
- Drop your bag.

16:29.496 --> 16:31.800
♪♪ <i>EXCITING MUSIC...</i>

16:31.867 --> 16:33.804
<i>♪ ♪</i>

16:34.104 --> 16:36.741
No diamonds, just... this.

16:39.467 --> 16:40.960
- Hello? <i>
- It's Hawkins.</i>

16:41.159 --> 16:43.822
When will you learn that
you will never beat me?

16:43.889 --> 16:45.394
You're not gonna get away with this.

16:45.452 --> 16:47.512
- We're gonna take you down.<i>
- It's over, Holt.</i>

16:47.570 --> 16:50.662
Checkmate.
Knight's bishop to queen five.

16:50.813 --> 16:51.937
<i>Buh-bye now.</i>

16:53.406 --> 16:54.943
She set us up.

16:55.010 --> 16:56.373
Oy vey.

16:59.210 --> 17:01.050
- What do you want, Peralta?
- Stop everything.

17:01.112 --> 17:02.944
Romero told me that the
Blizz is in the soap.

17:03.038 --> 17:04.609
If you take away his supply,
he'll know I'm the snitch

17:04.666 --> 17:05.780
- and kill me.
- Nah, sorry.

17:05.838 --> 17:07.351
I already made the report
to my bosses,

17:07.407 --> 17:08.752
and they were very pleased.

17:08.810 --> 17:12.484
Glen couldn't stop smiling. Glen?

17:12.679 --> 17:14.049
You don't know what a big deal that is.

17:14.106 --> 17:15.282
Anyway, you're too late.

17:15.349 --> 17:16.952
We're confiscating all of Romero's soap

17:17.013 --> 17:18.752
- as we speak.
- Okay, how about this?

17:18.810 --> 17:19.958
Throw me in solitary. Right?

17:20.025 --> 17:20.955
That way,
Romero can't get to me.

17:21.013 --> 17:22.214
No, Glen's already coming down on me

17:22.271 --> 17:23.838
about giving too much solitary.

17:23.896 --> 17:25.770
And I don't wanna piss off Glen.

17:25.929 --> 17:27.907
- Obviously.
- What if I spit on you?

17:28.011 --> 17:29.123
You're the warden, right?
That's gotta be

17:29.180 --> 17:30.537
at least a month in the hole.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.468
Oh, man, my mouth is all dried out

17:33.526 --> 17:35.486
from doing the meth. That's
why you don't do meth.

17:36.628 --> 17:39.366
Ah, oh, no, no!
Don't tase me, man!

17:39.425 --> 17:41.430
Remember that? So funny... but don't.

17:41.722 --> 17:42.978
I don't understand.

17:43.036 --> 17:45.306
How did she know we were
mirroring her phone?

17:45.403 --> 17:47.030
We had one chance,
and we blew it!

17:47.088 --> 17:48.754
I know you're upset,
but it's really hard

17:48.812 --> 17:50.488
to take you seriously when
you still look like that.

17:50.545 --> 17:51.926
I used Broadway-caliber spirit gum.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.369
This baby is fused to my cheeks.

17:53.449 --> 17:54.810
Squad, I think I'm onto something.

17:54.871 --> 17:56.031
I was listening to an episode

17:56.088 --> 17:57.104
of Boyle's podcast.

17:57.162 --> 17:58.265
Not the one Terry was on, I hope.

17:58.322 --> 18:00.417
No, of course not.
That one was problematic.

18:00.475 --> 18:02.100
What did I do that was so wrong?

18:02.158 --> 18:03.837
It was the episode about
Flaxton Hill Farms.

18:03.894 --> 18:05.372
The part where Scully said

18:05.430 --> 18:06.894
the pigs were being force-fed.

18:06.952 --> 18:09.190
These pigs weigh more than
200 pounds,

18:09.248 --> 18:10.944
which means they're finishing pigs.

18:11.002 --> 18:13.375
And why would a farmer
force-feed a finishing pig?

18:13.541 --> 18:15.055
I don't know what finishing pigs are.

18:15.122 --> 18:16.367
- Me neither.
- I'm totally lost.

18:16.424 --> 18:17.324
Because he was feeding them

18:17.382 --> 18:18.468
something other than food!

18:18.562 --> 18:19.541
The diamonds!

18:19.599 --> 18:21.169
She's moving them inside the pigs!

18:21.314 --> 18:22.703
Let's move.

18:23.402 --> 18:24.950
- I still don't get it.
- Nobody does.

18:25.008 --> 18:26.241
They're just pretending.

18:26.308 --> 18:27.443
I can't believe this.

18:27.510 --> 18:28.779
I'm gonna die in here, and then

18:28.846 --> 18:30.449
you're gonna eat my castrated body.

18:30.516 --> 18:32.652
I guess, but it'd be
a pretty boring meal

18:32.719 --> 18:35.144
- without dessert.
- Oh, my God.

18:35.424 --> 18:37.361
Oh, no. Romero's headed towards us.

18:37.456 --> 18:39.047
- And he looks angry.
- Well, he always looks angry.

18:39.104 --> 18:40.676
Maybe it's not directed at you.

18:40.771 --> 18:42.504
No, now he's pointing at you.

18:42.661 --> 18:45.043
- This is bad.
- Yeah, I know it's bad.

18:46.192 --> 18:48.437
The warden took my entire stash of soap.

18:48.588 --> 18:50.876
Apparently, someone
told him it was Blizz.

18:50.947 --> 18:52.831
And you want me to help you
figure out who it was.

18:52.888 --> 18:54.814
- Well, it was Tank.
- No, it wasn't.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.152
Yeah, it wasn't Tank. It was me.

18:56.209 --> 18:57.582
Tank, I came clean and saved your life.

18:57.639 --> 18:59.258
- Now you owe me.
- No I don't.

18:59.734 --> 19:01.411
I told you what I do to snitches.

19:01.469 --> 19:02.982
- Hold it, Romero.
- Caleb, what are you doing?

19:03.039 --> 19:04.476
It's okay, Jake. I got this.

19:04.543 --> 19:06.343
Peralta is my best friend.

19:06.580 --> 19:07.892
If you wanna kill him,
you're gonna have to

19:07.949 --> 19:10.386
kill me first, because friendship...

19:10.453 --> 19:12.757
Oh, my God,
he stabbed me, Jake!

19:12.824 --> 19:14.360
Everybody, get on the ground!

19:14.427 --> 19:15.629
- Now!
- You're next, Peralta.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.280
You better sleep with one eye open.

19:17.359 --> 19:18.528
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.703
He poked me in my tummy.

19:21.343 --> 19:23.714
Are you sure? I need you to be sure.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.121
You were right.

19:25.184 --> 19:26.665
Pigs' stomachs were full of diamonds.

19:26.814 --> 19:28.141
That's it.

19:28.350 --> 19:29.753
Everyone on the ground!

19:29.955 --> 19:31.767
- Put down your weapons!
- You're being recorded

19:31.824 --> 19:33.795
for a podcast! You will
sign a consent form.

19:33.907 --> 19:35.832
- What's going on here?
- We found the diamonds

19:35.899 --> 19:37.052
and Langdon confessed.

19:37.110 --> 19:38.270
It's over, Hawkins.

19:38.328 --> 19:39.629
Pawn to king square five,

19:39.769 --> 19:41.487
king's knight to the third square

19:41.545 --> 19:44.552
on the bishop's file, queen takes on F7!

19:44.644 --> 19:47.714
Checkmate! Now, that's a chess move.

19:47.884 --> 19:48.954
Buh-bye now.

19:51.163 --> 19:52.735
Peralta.

19:52.845 --> 19:53.944
Warden.

19:54.002 --> 19:56.541
Your squad busted Melanie Hawkins.

19:57.937 --> 19:59.282
What?

19:59.415 --> 20:01.785
You're getting out. Come with me.

20:01.888 --> 20:02.929
Okay.

20:03.279 --> 20:06.322
Wait. Can I do one thing first?

20:06.820 --> 20:08.221
I wanted to say good-bye.

20:08.379 --> 20:09.757
I can't believe you saved my life.

20:09.824 --> 20:11.176
I would not do it again.

20:11.234 --> 20:13.504
- It really hurt.
- Yeah... but you did do it.

20:13.597 --> 20:14.932
And I regret it so much.

20:14.990 --> 20:16.372
Caleb, you're ruining this.

20:16.451 --> 20:18.414
Look, I just wanted to say
thank you for everything.

20:18.471 --> 20:20.773
You got me through this.
I'm gonna miss you.

20:20.843 --> 20:21.941
Aww.

20:22.036 --> 20:23.426
Put her there, pal.

20:23.626 --> 20:26.664
Guards, guards!

20:26.787 --> 20:27.999
Ladies and gentlemen, please give

20:28.056 --> 20:29.437
a warm Nine-Nine welcome

20:29.525 --> 20:31.459
to Jake Peralta and Rosa Diaz!

20:33.706 --> 20:35.520
- Ah, it's so good to be back.
- Amen, brother.

20:35.577 --> 20:36.849
Can I buy a free man a drink?

20:37.006 --> 20:38.636
I'd rather have a drink of that mouth.

20:38.694 --> 20:40.647
- Ugh.
- I'm sorry, I just...

20:43.182 --> 20:44.897
- I love you.
- I love you too.

20:45.047 --> 20:46.423
Hello, I'm also back.

20:46.498 --> 20:47.759
- Hey, Rosa.
- So, I heard you spent

20:47.816 --> 20:49.642
some time in solitary.
Pretty dope, right?

20:49.715 --> 20:50.460
Uh...

20:50.518 --> 20:52.942
Scar, Sarabi
and I didn't see you

20:53.000 --> 20:54.736
at the presentation of Simba.

20:54.803 --> 20:57.474
Oh, Mufasa, did I miss it?

20:57.543 --> 21:00.549
That's simply... awful.

21:00.607 --> 21:01.910
I handled it well.

21:01.968 --> 21:03.870
Sir, I can't believe
your obscure knowledge

21:03.944 --> 21:06.833
of pig-feeding charts saved us.
How did you even think of that?

21:06.912 --> 21:08.954
Frankly, I'm embarrassed
it took so long.

21:09.103 --> 21:11.919
I should've realized the
second I saw those hogs.

21:13.562 --> 21:14.715
Excuse me.

21:17.488 --> 21:18.957
- Hello?
- So, Captain Holt,

21:19.120 --> 21:21.086
did my information prove useful?

21:21.144 --> 21:22.714
Were the diamonds in the pigs?

21:22.772 --> 21:24.224
- Yes, you were right.<i>
- Good.</i>

21:24.282 --> 21:26.067
<i>And now you owe me a favor.</i>

21:26.656 --> 21:28.880
And don't even think about screwing me.

21:32.523 --> 21:34.560
Captain, we're doing toasts.

21:34.802 --> 21:36.651
Everyone, raise your drinks!

21:36.717 --> 21:40.647
The 99th precinct is
officially all back together!

21:40.749 --> 21:41.830
Nine-Nine!

21:41.920 --> 21:43.523
Nine-Nine!
