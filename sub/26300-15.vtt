WEBVTT

00:00.914 --> 00:02.303
Previously on Star...

00:02.328 --> 00:04.243
I was a baby! You bastard!

00:04.268 --> 00:05.703
I tried to kill his ass.

00:05.711 --> 00:07.770
You sorry you almost killed
Davis because you were high?

00:07.794 --> 00:10.050
'Cause I just filed for temporary
custody over him until Star

00:10.074 --> 00:11.373
gets her ass out of the hospital.

00:11.392 --> 00:13.753
You asked me to protect y'all from Leon.

00:13.778 --> 00:15.550
I always come back for what's mine.

00:15.575 --> 00:17.491
If you touch one hair on her head...

00:17.515 --> 00:19.626
I come here, and I play
music for her every day.

00:19.651 --> 00:22.150
- I'd be a better father than you.
- Yeah, well, you ain't.

00:22.175 --> 00:23.775
Star is really sick,

00:23.800 --> 00:26.433
and she might not ever be
the Star we used to know.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.952
My name is Noah Brooks, and...

00:30.635 --> 00:31.834
I'm 12 days sober.

00:31.859 --> 00:33.854
Noah, it's Bruce. I'm worried about you.

00:33.878 --> 00:35.603
Hey, Bobby. Look, I-I think

00:35.628 --> 00:37.815
you need to get down here.
Your son needs you.

00:37.840 --> 00:39.100
Calvin is your devil.

00:43.342 --> 00:45.500
Get your hands off me.

00:45.525 --> 00:48.021
Come on, baby. Uh-uh. This way.

00:48.046 --> 00:49.891
And if I find any of
this on the blogs, I swear

00:49.916 --> 00:52.421
- I will track you down in this mop of a wig...
- Noah, wake up. Noah!

00:52.445 --> 00:54.585
- Noah, baby, I'll call you later.
- Think I'm playing.

00:54.609 --> 00:56.151
Damn thots.

00:56.176 --> 00:58.834
- Come on, Pa, what are you...
- You've been AWOL

00:58.859 --> 01:00.029
for more than a week.

01:00.054 --> 01:01.357
Had me worried sick
when Bruce called me.

01:01.381 --> 01:03.525
Look at you in here.

01:03.550 --> 01:04.894
You done hit rock bottom, Noah.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.560
How many times I got to stop you
from trying to kill yourself, huh?

01:08.170 --> 01:09.370
Sit up.

01:09.661 --> 01:10.856
Sit up!

01:12.076 --> 01:13.946
I'm-a go get y'all some
tea while y'all talk.

01:14.397 --> 01:15.787
While we talk about what, huh?

01:15.812 --> 01:17.522
You probably done told him
every damn thing already.

01:17.546 --> 01:19.566
- Hey, watch your attitude.
- I ain't worried about Noah.

01:19.590 --> 01:21.550
He ain't mad at nobody but himself.

01:22.535 --> 01:23.872
Well, you should have called me.

01:23.897 --> 01:24.955
Yeah, well, I did.

01:24.980 --> 01:26.220
But your voice mail was full.

01:29.087 --> 01:31.360
Man, I kept trying to
ask you if you was okay.

01:31.385 --> 01:34.188
- And I'm fine.
- You not fine! You clearly not fine!

01:34.560 --> 01:37.128
You know what, I'm here now, and
I'm not gonna leave you again.

01:37.224 --> 01:39.030
You gonna detox right here.

01:39.055 --> 01:40.528
- What?
- You on lockdown.

01:40.553 --> 01:43.139
Ain't on lockdown.
I got ASA luncheons...

01:43.164 --> 01:44.416
- You do?
- Yes.

01:44.441 --> 01:46.158
Ask me if I care about that.

01:46.775 --> 01:47.876
Go ahead!

01:50.416 --> 01:51.507
Exactly.

01:52.326 --> 01:53.651
Get comfortable.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:24.139 --> 02:25.680
Come on, y'all.

02:25.705 --> 02:27.340
You know Star's gonna
walk in here any minute,

02:27.364 --> 02:28.774
and you haven't put your decorations up.

02:28.798 --> 02:30.817
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

02:30.842 --> 02:32.414
I remember having that look.

02:33.711 --> 02:35.172
I couldn't keep my hands off your ass.

02:35.196 --> 02:37.084
- You want some, too?
- Mm-hmm.

02:37.109 --> 02:39.323
Oh. Oh.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.818
It just got really intimate.

02:41.936 --> 02:43.327
So, when's the wedding?

02:43.329 --> 02:44.754
Soon as my baby wins an ASA.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.342
We're still looking for venues, though.

02:46.366 --> 02:48.143
I was thinking the
Four Seasons in Midtown.

02:48.167 --> 02:50.117
- So a big wedding.
- What?

02:50.119 --> 02:52.194
- That's not big.
- That is big.

02:52.313 --> 02:56.023
Baby, it's the Four Seasons,
not Buckingham Palace.

02:56.025 --> 02:58.079
Yeah, Derek, we know you
got that wheelchair money.

02:58.103 --> 02:59.743
- Can I live?
- Whoa.

03:01.547 --> 03:02.841
- Look who's home.
- Hey.

03:02.865 --> 03:04.982
- Hey.
- What?

03:05.007 --> 03:06.182
Hey.

03:06.593 --> 03:08.389
It's really good to see you back here.

03:08.414 --> 03:09.988
There's Mommy.

03:10.013 --> 03:11.677
- Yes.
- It's Mommy.

03:11.702 --> 03:13.683
Yes.

03:13.801 --> 03:15.393
Hi.

03:17.230 --> 03:19.163
Hi, baby.

03:19.188 --> 03:20.221
It's Mama.

03:21.175 --> 03:23.017
It's Mama. I'm back.

03:23.719 --> 03:27.530
Oh, you got so big. You got so big.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.350
Take it easy. Now, you
know, the doctor said

03:29.375 --> 03:31.358
you may experience a little dizziness

03:31.383 --> 03:33.375
- and nausea, so...
- Yeah.

03:33.688 --> 03:35.938
I know. I'm good. I promise.

03:36.099 --> 03:39.041
Hi, baby. Hi.

03:39.043 --> 03:40.627
Remember me?

03:42.799 --> 03:44.349
I'm back now.

03:46.258 --> 03:48.960
Hey, you just woke up a week ago.

03:49.801 --> 03:51.378
So take it slow.

03:51.403 --> 03:52.522
I know.

03:54.131 --> 03:55.715
You had a lot thrown at you, you know.

03:55.740 --> 03:57.119
So have you, Miss C.

03:58.395 --> 04:00.340
Have they made funeral
arrangements for your dad?

04:01.709 --> 04:03.829
My father and I had a
complicated relationship,

04:03.854 --> 04:06.797
so I'm staying out of all of that.

04:06.822 --> 04:09.884
Speaking of fathers, where's Noah?

04:11.527 --> 04:13.160
Tied up in his music.

04:13.185 --> 04:14.304
Oh.

04:15.363 --> 04:17.040
Okay.

04:17.065 --> 04:18.959
What's that, little man?

04:18.983 --> 04:20.749
What's that cry for?

04:20.750 --> 04:22.698
I think that's his...

04:22.723 --> 04:25.166
- "I need my binky" cry.
- Oh.

04:25.191 --> 04:26.898
There we go, little man.

04:26.923 --> 04:28.409
Yeah, he does that all the time.

04:30.646 --> 04:31.899
I'm sorry.

04:32.828 --> 04:34.717
Don't worry. You got
time to figure all that out.

04:37.860 --> 04:38.959
Hello.

04:39.392 --> 04:40.761
I'm looking right at 'em.

04:41.095 --> 04:42.535
All right, we'll see you down there.

04:43.907 --> 04:45.118
That was Maurice.

04:45.143 --> 04:46.509
He wants y'all to come
down to the luncheon

04:46.533 --> 04:48.360
and look at Take 3's intro package.

04:48.362 --> 04:50.240
- Okay, cool.
- All right, let's go.

04:50.264 --> 04:52.006
Where are you going?

04:52.889 --> 04:54.166
I'm going with you.

04:54.191 --> 04:56.465
- I'm ready to go.
- You know I can watch Davis.

04:56.490 --> 04:58.087
Nah, he's my little road dog.

04:58.330 --> 04:59.389
It's all good.

05:00.291 --> 05:01.523
Let's go to work.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.605
Hey, Star.

05:04.629 --> 05:05.800
Good to see you.

05:05.825 --> 05:07.574
I didn't think you'd
be back at it so soon.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.298
She's not. She's taking it easy.

05:10.082 --> 05:11.925
So, how'd the intro package come out?

05:11.950 --> 05:13.340
The promo team knocked it out the park.

05:13.364 --> 05:15.114
It'll play behind the girls
when they take the stage

05:15.138 --> 05:16.473
to accept the nomination.

05:16.498 --> 05:18.591
- And what about the "So Sick" package?
- All good.

05:18.970 --> 05:21.671
Alex, you'll promo that one
alone if Noah doesn't show.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.171
Why wouldn't Noah show?
It's the damn ASAs.

05:24.196 --> 05:25.303
He's coming.

05:25.328 --> 05:28.246
Yo, what's the deal with the
performance at the actual award show?

05:28.905 --> 05:30.538
Word is the committee is looking

05:30.563 --> 05:33.205
for another artist up for
Best Pop Album to perform.

05:33.230 --> 05:34.517
Amber Drake.

05:34.996 --> 05:36.660
She just got on the scene, Maurice.

05:36.685 --> 05:38.237
She's huge right now,

05:38.262 --> 05:40.542
which is why they got her
singing at the nominee luncheon.

05:40.566 --> 05:41.856
Oh, so she's gonna have a leg up

05:41.880 --> 05:43.732
with all those producers and voters now.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.154

Yes, that's right!

06:36.093 --> 06:37.973
- Screw doctor's orders.
- Sounded great.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.123
I'm not letting that broke
Madonna take us down.

06:40.148 --> 06:42.185
You need to get us that
performance at the luncheon.

06:48.279 --> 06:50.145
I ought to pistol-whip your dumb ass

06:50.170 --> 06:51.684
for trying to take what's mine.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.156
Please do it so I can go

06:53.181 --> 06:54.957
to the cops and tell
them all of your dirt.

06:55.075 --> 06:57.834
Ain't nobody trying to
believe no ex-hooker.

06:57.859 --> 07:00.801
Say it again so I can
shank your stupid ass.

07:00.829 --> 07:03.261
Dior is not your property.

07:03.286 --> 07:06.237
You're gonna leave her
and all those girls alone.

07:06.262 --> 07:09.879
You really ain't in a position to be
putting no demands up on nobody.

07:09.904 --> 07:13.363
But you are in a position
to give me something.

07:13.388 --> 07:15.509
Don't even think about it.

07:15.534 --> 07:17.126
This your auntie's bar, right?

07:17.525 --> 07:18.604
Why don't you let me run

07:18.629 --> 07:20.996
Dior and some other
girls up out of here?

07:21.157 --> 07:22.856
Why in the hell would I do that?

07:22.881 --> 07:25.201
Well, I guess you don't
really care about the safety

07:25.226 --> 07:26.860
of your girls after all, huh?

07:26.885 --> 07:28.718
You know how hard it is
out there in them streets,

07:28.742 --> 07:30.367
especially for a girl like you,

07:30.392 --> 07:32.000
and you made top dollar.

07:32.025 --> 07:33.409
Oh!

07:35.092 --> 07:37.385
Look, you manage 'em.

07:38.213 --> 07:40.541
I'll be hands-off.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.751
But I make my money.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.133
Think about it.

07:56.037 --> 07:57.966
Hey, let's put these
banners up in the lobby.

07:57.990 --> 07:59.497
Come on.

08:02.855 --> 08:04.207
Don't look at me like that.

08:05.167 --> 08:07.310
I'm breathing heavy
'cause this is heavy.

08:07.335 --> 08:09.048
The doctor cleared me. I'm good.

08:09.073 --> 08:11.601
To leave the hospital. Not perform.

08:11.626 --> 08:14.652
Look, I want this ASA
just as much as you do.

08:14.677 --> 08:16.301
I need this, Alex.

08:17.023 --> 08:18.106
You know I do.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.101
My solo career is falling off.

08:20.126 --> 08:22.419
Star, we can't have you go
back to the hospital, okay?

08:22.443 --> 08:23.487
You need to slow your roll.

08:23.511 --> 08:24.693
This feels slow.

08:24.718 --> 08:26.359
I know. It's hard.

08:26.957 --> 08:28.382
Hey, guys.

08:28.407 --> 08:29.940
I'm Amber Drake.

08:30.484 --> 08:32.190
This is crazy, right?

08:32.215 --> 08:34.120
- I'm a huge fan.
- Oh.

08:34.145 --> 08:36.296
"I Bring Me" was my jam back in the day.

08:36.298 --> 08:38.760
Back in the day? It was two years ago.

08:38.785 --> 08:41.095
I get the sacrifices y'all
had to make to get here.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.232
And now we're nominated
for Best Pop Album.

08:44.258 --> 08:46.601
- Can you believe it?
- I cannot believe it.

08:46.625 --> 08:47.975
And your first time out the gate.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.651
Well, this is my first album,

08:49.653 --> 08:51.554
but I've been grinding since I was ten.

08:51.556 --> 08:53.397
Just like y'all.

08:53.399 --> 08:55.321
Oh, I'm sure it was exactly like us.

09:03.200 --> 09:07.297
Mmm-mmm, I got a million
and one things to do

09:07.322 --> 09:09.006
before your father's funeral.

09:09.031 --> 09:11.103
Don't know why you're
wasting your time on that.

09:11.128 --> 09:14.313
Lottie, we're not gonna
have that conversation again.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.461
I finished his eulogy,

09:17.010 --> 09:18.440
and I want you to read it.

09:18.465 --> 09:19.968
And I also want you to help me pick out

09:19.992 --> 09:21.834
a family photo for the program.

09:21.910 --> 09:24.786
I'd be happy not to have my
name or my face in that program.

09:24.811 --> 09:27.110
Lottie, stop being so doggone dramatic.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.027
You know what, Ma, you...

09:31.889 --> 09:33.560
you know what that man did to me,

09:33.585 --> 09:36.505
and yet you're walking around here
like it never even happened.

09:36.708 --> 09:38.762
Which is almost as damn
bad as him trying to stick

09:38.786 --> 09:40.071
- his nasty-ass...
- Oh, no!

09:40.095 --> 09:41.790
I don't want to hear that no more!

09:42.654 --> 09:44.522
Look, I've done the best I could

09:44.547 --> 09:45.783
to raise you and your sister,

09:45.808 --> 09:48.827
making y'all into the strong
women y'all are today.

09:49.616 --> 09:51.357
But in life sometimes
you got to do things

09:51.382 --> 09:53.825
that you don't want to
do for the greater good.

09:55.036 --> 09:56.844
What greater good, Ma?

09:57.636 --> 09:59.019
What does that even mean?

09:59.566 --> 10:02.471
It means your daddy is gone. He's dead.

10:02.996 --> 10:04.885
So whatever problem you had with him,

10:05.004 --> 10:08.106
you need to let it
lay down and die, too.

10:10.772 --> 10:12.827
I ain't going to that funeral.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.220
I'm glad he's dead.

10:31.555 --> 10:34.031
One second.

10:34.125 --> 10:35.624
One second, baby.

10:35.626 --> 10:37.209
Here I come. I got you.

10:37.328 --> 10:39.270
Let's see where your daddy's at.

10:39.297 --> 10:40.838
Haven't seen him yet.

10:44.235 --> 10:46.410
It's Noah. You know what to do.

10:46.677 --> 10:48.726
Noah, what is going on?

10:48.751 --> 10:50.383
I've called you a hundred times.

10:50.408 --> 10:52.141
Call me back about your son.

10:54.346 --> 10:56.672
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.130
You heard from Noah?

10:59.269 --> 11:00.401
Let me hold Davis.

11:00.832 --> 11:02.269
No, I got him.

11:05.740 --> 11:06.821
Where's Noah?

11:07.208 --> 11:09.283
- I don't know.
- Simone.

11:10.778 --> 11:12.861
Noah's been taking pills.

11:14.243 --> 11:16.116
I walked in, and Davis was crying,

11:16.141 --> 11:18.416
and Noah was passed out on the floor.

11:18.418 --> 11:20.336
He was alone?

11:20.441 --> 11:22.741
- No.
- You took the time to throw me

11:22.766 --> 11:24.876
a welcome home party, but you
didn't tell me what's going on

11:24.900 --> 11:26.422
- with my child's father?
- You were already

11:26.446 --> 11:28.297
going through a lot, and I
didn't want to make it worse.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.067
I would never leave my baby
in the hands of a junkie.

11:30.091 --> 11:31.696
- Okay.
- I would die first, Simone.

11:31.721 --> 11:34.430
- You know that!
- I know, and I took him out of there, Star.

11:34.455 --> 11:36.070
You shouldn't have had to, though.

11:36.095 --> 11:37.478
I should have been here.

11:37.503 --> 11:39.143
He's three months old.
I should have been here.

11:39.167 --> 11:40.895
Star, you couldn't have
been there, and that's okay.

11:40.919 --> 11:42.435
I took care of it.

11:44.668 --> 11:47.356
But I'm back now. Okay? I'm back.

11:47.381 --> 11:49.581
So I don't want you
making any more decisions

11:49.606 --> 11:52.104
for me or my son.

11:52.129 --> 11:54.680
Don't talk to me like I haven't been
here for you and Davis every day.

11:54.704 --> 11:55.716
Please.

11:55.741 --> 11:57.433
Simone, where are you going?

12:08.063 --> 12:09.431
Hey, Lottie.

12:10.068 --> 12:12.974
Sister Hodge sends her
condolences for Daddy.

12:12.999 --> 12:15.109
She made us a pound cake. Ugh.

12:15.134 --> 12:17.297
People keep bringing
up this damn funeral.

12:17.322 --> 12:19.739
Yeah, and you know Mama
keeps up her appearances

12:19.764 --> 12:21.972
- so she won't feel so bad.
- I don't know why.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.176
Denial's the best way.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.892
Ain't nothing to cry about.

12:25.917 --> 12:27.442
I don't know, sis.

12:27.839 --> 12:30.557
I think them sins caught
up with his ass in the end.

12:30.582 --> 12:32.002
And what's that supposed to mean?

12:36.405 --> 12:37.621
Did you do something?

12:41.209 --> 12:42.628
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey!

12:42.653 --> 12:43.768
- Hey!
- There's my girl.

12:43.793 --> 12:45.343
How you doing, Big Cousin Duke?

12:45.368 --> 12:47.312
- What's up, cousin?
- What's happening, girl?

12:49.418 --> 12:51.666
Look at him. Big-headed Rashad.

12:51.691 --> 12:53.060
You can just call me "Rashad" now.

12:53.085 --> 12:54.089
- Oh.
- Yeah.

12:54.114 --> 12:56.727
Look at you all grown
up and smelling yourself.

12:57.854 --> 13:00.654
Hey, what's this I hear about y'all
not coming to your daddy's funeral?

13:02.676 --> 13:04.834
Look, we don't need to talk about that.

13:04.836 --> 13:06.756
Come on now. This your
daddy we're talking about.

13:07.251 --> 13:08.930
Y'all got the nerve to do him like that?

13:09.017 --> 13:10.914
Now, I know you never forgave
him for leaving your mother.

13:10.938 --> 13:12.889
- I don't care about that.
- You did.

13:13.047 --> 13:14.581
You were always Daddy's little girl.

13:14.606 --> 13:16.172
Now, what'd he ever do to you?

13:19.746 --> 13:21.441
You need to stand down, Cousin.

13:21.466 --> 13:23.506
I need you to do right by your father.

13:28.356 --> 13:30.158
I'm-a check y'all later.

13:33.783 --> 13:37.050
Okay.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.459
Okay. You need some water, son?

13:40.484 --> 13:42.187
Bobby, this is a part of the detoxing.

13:42.212 --> 13:43.719
It's all right. Let
him soldier through it.

13:43.743 --> 13:45.157
Look, I can't soldier through it.

13:45.182 --> 13:46.883
We need to call a doctor or something?

13:46.908 --> 13:48.728
No, Pop. No, I'm good. I'm good. Just...

13:49.251 --> 13:51.031
I-I need some air.

13:51.056 --> 13:52.998
- I can't breathe. I need to get out of here. I need...
- Look, look...

13:53.022 --> 13:54.853
- Okay, all right.
- Look, Bobby, it's been 24 hours.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.936
Ain't no drugs in his
system. He just feeling it.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.212
That's all. It's a part of it.

13:58.237 --> 13:59.568
If you insist, I got a friend

13:59.593 --> 14:01.162
who's a detox specialist.
I can call him.

14:01.186 --> 14:02.216
Okay...

14:02.241 --> 14:05.309
Noah, open this door.

14:05.334 --> 14:06.687
- Oh, this crazy bitch here.
- Open the door.

14:06.711 --> 14:09.138
- Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.
- Bruce, open this door!

14:09.162 --> 14:10.225
- I can see you!
- Can I talk... can I talk

14:10.249 --> 14:11.970
- to you for a second... ?
- No, you may not.

14:13.368 --> 14:14.867
- Look, Star...
- What happened, Noah?

14:14.892 --> 14:15.901
Star, you need to take it easy.

14:15.925 --> 14:19.257
You promised me. I
trusted you with our son.

14:19.282 --> 14:20.656
- Star.
- What happened?

14:20.683 --> 14:22.377
- Star, it was an accident.
- I don't want to hear no excuses.

14:22.401 --> 14:24.730
I heard enough of those
from my mother. Stand up.

14:24.755 --> 14:26.261
Get up and look me in my eye, Noah.

14:26.286 --> 14:28.206
- I don't feel bad for you.
- Star.

14:30.197 --> 14:32.091
Look at me in my eyes and tell me

14:32.115 --> 14:34.481
what happened. What happened?

14:34.506 --> 14:36.926
Star, look, I'll never
forgive myself, all right?

14:36.951 --> 14:38.491
- I don't believe you.
- I'm sorry.

14:38.499 --> 14:40.783
All I wanted was for my
child to have a father.

14:40.901 --> 14:42.760
But take a good look,

14:42.920 --> 14:46.063
because this is the last time
that you're gonna see your son.

14:47.065 --> 14:48.794
Star, would you calm
your crazy ass down?

14:48.818 --> 14:50.484
I will never be calm about this.

14:50.603 --> 14:51.723
Star, I'm sorry.

14:51.748 --> 14:53.414
- Ever!
- I'm sorry.

14:55.199 --> 14:56.924
Nice to meet you.

14:56.951 --> 14:58.284
Hey, listen.

15:05.317 --> 15:06.685
Sorry I'm late.

15:08.016 --> 15:09.590
Some things never change.

15:11.774 --> 15:13.015
I went to see Noah.

15:13.765 --> 15:15.173
I wanted to see him for myself.

15:17.225 --> 15:19.992
I get that we're all supposed
to hate him right now,

15:20.017 --> 15:23.285
but he's really trying
to get it together.

15:23.478 --> 15:25.703
Yeah, I know that, but he's
not being a good father.

15:26.405 --> 15:28.289
Bruce said he's trying
to get sober, but...

15:28.291 --> 15:30.383
- Mama used to say the same thing.
- Exactly.

15:31.350 --> 15:33.176
We all got things we
got to get past in life,

15:34.178 --> 15:35.949
but it always gets
passed down to our kids,

15:35.974 --> 15:37.332
whether we like it or not.

15:37.483 --> 15:38.741
And what made you so wise?

15:38.910 --> 15:41.553
Juvie. Dealing with your ass.

15:42.444 --> 15:43.839
Sorry I yelled at you earlier.

15:43.864 --> 15:46.186
- No, you're not.
- You want to say sorry?

15:46.211 --> 15:48.728
- No, I don't want to say sorry.
- See, nothing's different.

15:48.753 --> 15:50.127
You two are still arguing.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.246
You're still coming in late

15:52.271 --> 15:54.509
and yelling like you just
came from the trailer park.

15:55.413 --> 15:56.694
What's up with the luncheon?

15:56.719 --> 15:59.904
- Yeah, Maurice got us a spot to perform.
- Dope. Nobody told me.

16:00.022 --> 16:02.225
- We got to talk about that.
- What is there to talk about?

16:02.249 --> 16:03.616
If y'all are gonna tell me to sit my ass

16:03.640 --> 16:04.964
down again, I'm gonna go off.

16:04.989 --> 16:07.901
This performance and this nomination
are all that I've got right now.

16:07.926 --> 16:09.451
If we're performing, I'm performing.

16:10.194 --> 16:11.732
You got the track, load it up.

16:13.926 --> 16:15.937
You think I'm playing?
'Cause I'm not. Load it up.

16:17.017 --> 16:18.147
Okay.

16:19.632 --> 16:20.700
Let's hear it.

16:23.729 --> 16:25.324
♪ Can I see you in the... ? ♪

16:27.159 --> 16:28.300
It's been a while.

16:28.325 --> 16:29.417
Again.

16:33.380 --> 16:35.715
♪ Can I see you in the morning? ♪

16:37.627 --> 16:38.627
Run it back.

16:40.118 --> 16:42.299
Remember, the doctor
said not to push it, okay?

16:42.323 --> 16:43.633
Run it back, Simone.

16:43.658 --> 16:45.018
It's just been a while. I'm fine.

16:45.813 --> 16:47.184
Run it back!

16:47.209 --> 16:48.700
♪ Can I see you... ♪

16:49.465 --> 16:50.739
♪ Can I see you... ♪

16:50.764 --> 16:53.832
I'm singing the...
I'm singing the right note, right?

17:02.844 --> 17:06.000
I'm sorry. Did you say
vocal rest? No, I can't.

17:08.527 --> 17:09.618
Great.

17:11.753 --> 17:12.896
Great.

17:14.126 --> 17:16.242
Damn it! I'm sorry.

17:16.268 --> 17:20.066
It's okay. It's okay.

17:20.090 --> 17:22.618
Are you mad at the world, too? Huh?

17:22.948 --> 17:24.422
You want to go on vocal rest?

17:24.424 --> 17:26.503
Maybe that's what you need.

17:28.474 --> 17:30.191
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:34.315 --> 17:35.630
I, uh...

17:36.478 --> 17:37.936
heard you were home.

17:38.455 --> 17:39.746
You look great.

17:40.092 --> 17:42.692
Shh, baby. It's okay.

17:42.717 --> 17:44.645
- And he will not stop crying.
- No.

17:46.295 --> 17:47.612
You want to say hi?

17:47.917 --> 17:48.933
No, I actually...

17:50.058 --> 17:51.434
came to see how you were doing.

17:52.324 --> 17:55.380
I'm amazing, outside the fact
that I'm the only person

17:55.405 --> 17:58.123
in the world who can't seem
to get my son to stop crying.

17:59.143 --> 18:00.599
You didn't know babies cry?

18:00.624 --> 18:02.471
- It's kind of what they do.
- Yeah.

18:02.496 --> 18:05.005
And the doctor just called
and put me on vocal rest.

18:05.030 --> 18:07.313
He said the intubation
bruised my vocal cords.

18:07.338 --> 18:09.097
Your vocal cords are damaged?

18:09.453 --> 18:11.286
That means I can't sing.

18:11.311 --> 18:14.446
And I have a performance
tomorrow at the ASA luncheon.

18:14.974 --> 18:16.566
Why do you need to?

18:16.591 --> 18:18.831
Because there's this new girl,
Amber, who's on our backs.

18:18.998 --> 18:21.207
Come on. You're scared of a new artist?

18:21.232 --> 18:22.622
No, it's not about a new artist.

18:22.647 --> 18:24.727
I'm not about to come home and lay down.

18:25.825 --> 18:27.603
I've been out the game for three months.

18:27.628 --> 18:29.561
I've lost all this time with my son.

18:29.586 --> 18:31.559
I've lost all this traction
on my solo stuff.

18:31.584 --> 18:33.834
Now I can't even sing. I have nothing.

18:33.859 --> 18:36.447
And he won't stop crying for me
because he hasn't been with me.

18:36.471 --> 18:38.431
Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me see him.

18:44.212 --> 18:45.554
It's okay. Shh...

18:45.581 --> 18:47.489
Come here.

18:52.253 --> 18:53.837
I missed you.

18:56.491 --> 18:58.266
- Star, I...
- I know.

18:58.384 --> 18:59.761
I know you had to move out.

19:01.037 --> 19:03.388
I understand. But Simone told me

19:03.413 --> 19:05.619
you visited me in the
hospital the whole time.

19:06.626 --> 19:08.185
It's 'cause I care about you.

19:11.356 --> 19:13.076
But right now we're just friends.

19:13.550 --> 19:15.150
It's all it can be.

19:21.615 --> 19:24.941
Remember when we were
on the bus to the family reunion...

19:25.262 --> 19:27.512
and you took the water cooler and put it

19:27.514 --> 19:31.004
in front of the bathroom, and
then Uncle Walt peed in it?

19:31.029 --> 19:33.478
You went crazy.

19:33.503 --> 19:35.373
You were crazier than me, though.

19:35.397 --> 19:37.013
But, see, you had everybody fooled

19:37.038 --> 19:39.426
with that whole
holier-than-thou routine.

19:39.451 --> 19:40.859
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but I know you.

19:41.185 --> 19:42.285
I know you, too.

19:42.887 --> 19:44.720
I was the first to figure
out you were different.

19:44.722 --> 19:45.919
Yeah.

19:45.944 --> 19:47.614
I mean, the fellas would be out playing

19:47.639 --> 19:49.167
two-hand touch in the streets,

19:49.286 --> 19:50.738
and you over here on the sidewalk

19:50.762 --> 19:51.962
jumping rope with the girls.

19:52.055 --> 19:54.031
And I was the baddest double Dutcher

19:54.032 --> 19:56.424
- in the neighborhood.
- There we go.

19:56.449 --> 19:58.233
I used to feel bad, though,

19:58.770 --> 20:01.730
'cause everybody kept
trying to make you be Arnold

20:02.207 --> 20:04.207
when that really wasn't who you are.

20:06.039 --> 20:10.323
Yeah. It took me a long time
to finally settle into my skin.

20:10.348 --> 20:11.895
You know, I was out in these streets

20:11.920 --> 20:14.278
- making a lot of mistakes.
- What saved you?

20:14.692 --> 20:17.129
- My grandmother.
- We all need someone

20:17.154 --> 20:18.653
to reach out and save us.

20:18.678 --> 20:20.913
There but for the grace of God...

20:22.392 --> 20:23.613
go I.

20:24.622 --> 20:25.987
Oh, here you go with this.

20:26.546 --> 20:27.908
Go to bed, church boy.

20:29.197 --> 20:30.210
- Hey, Ma.
- Hey, babe.

20:30.696 --> 20:31.757
Hey.

20:31.781 --> 20:34.352
Your dad said you're over here
to change my mind about the funeral?

20:34.376 --> 20:36.757
Nah. You know what's
sad about our family?

20:38.256 --> 20:41.494
We only really get together
for funerals and holidays.

20:43.114 --> 20:44.506
You know what?

20:45.002 --> 20:47.085
The older I get, the more I realize

20:47.110 --> 20:49.019
family ain't about who
you have to be with.

20:49.421 --> 20:51.088
It's who you choose to be with.

20:51.916 --> 20:53.724
And that ain't got
nothing to do with blood.

20:53.749 --> 20:56.701
All I can say is, your
father changed my life.

20:56.945 --> 20:58.355
He helped me find Christ,

20:58.380 --> 21:01.205
he paid my tuition all
throughout college.

21:01.299 --> 21:02.540
That's why I'm here...

21:02.659 --> 21:04.335
to pay my respects.

21:05.574 --> 21:08.663
I don't know what went down
between you and Cousin Calvin,

21:08.688 --> 21:10.788
but it can't be worth
you missing his funeral.

21:17.180 --> 21:18.823
Well, look-y here.

21:18.825 --> 21:21.543
When did you start coming
here to wet your whistle?

21:21.568 --> 21:23.364
When I found out the drinks was free.

21:23.388 --> 21:25.388
I know the owner.

21:25.413 --> 21:27.198
- And you lucky to have me.
- Hello, would you care for a drink?

21:27.200 --> 21:30.235
Because I've been fending calls
off of Ma all damn day.

21:30.353 --> 21:32.334
Yeah, well, she done
made my place ground zero

21:32.359 --> 21:33.532
for this damn funeral.

21:33.557 --> 21:35.765
Yeah, but you got to look
at that bright side, though.

21:35.767 --> 21:38.293
You have plenty of food
and a whole lot of alcohol.

21:38.318 --> 21:40.523
Yeah, for a man we love to hate.

21:40.548 --> 21:41.880
Yeah.

21:44.033 --> 21:46.626
- Mmm.
- Carlotta, he's gone now.

21:46.786 --> 21:48.757
You know, God works in mysterious ways.

21:48.782 --> 21:50.040
That's Scripture.

21:51.908 --> 21:53.135
Was it God?

21:53.601 --> 21:55.060
Or was it you?

21:57.229 --> 21:59.809
Look, Mama wasn't there for
you, and she still ain't.

21:59.833 --> 22:02.329
And Daddy was filthy guilty,
hiding behind the fact

22:02.354 --> 22:04.939
that he was your stepdad,
so I couldn't let that slide.

22:04.964 --> 22:06.487
I had to step in and
do what I had to do.

22:06.489 --> 22:07.839
And you okay with that?

22:07.864 --> 22:09.580
Hell no, I'm not okay with that,

22:09.605 --> 22:11.467
but I'd do it again if
it meant protecting you.

22:11.837 --> 22:12.895
Protecting me?

22:13.320 --> 22:16.229
Every word of denial was
a bullet to your heart.

22:17.255 --> 22:19.984
So I packed that damn gun away for good.

22:20.145 --> 22:21.819
Aw, man.

22:21.980 --> 22:24.155
I'm just so tired of this whole mess.

22:24.316 --> 22:26.486
Yo, not telling people why
you're not participating

22:26.511 --> 22:28.688
in Daddy's funeral
gives him power over you.

22:28.713 --> 22:30.261
- And he's dead.
- I am not having

22:30.286 --> 22:32.837
this whole damn family
look at me like some victim.

22:32.862 --> 22:35.329
Lottie, do you remember what
you used to tell me as a kid?

22:35.753 --> 22:38.012
I told you a lot of stuff.
You was bad as hell.

22:38.037 --> 22:41.596
But you used to tell me that
the truth would set me free.

22:42.151 --> 22:43.960
I told the truth, Cassie.

22:44.120 --> 22:47.422
And the person I needed to
believe me the most refuses to.

22:47.564 --> 22:50.124
Well, I believe you,
if that means anything.

22:50.585 --> 22:52.552
And I always got your six.

22:53.671 --> 22:55.827
Well, you could prove that
by getting us another round

22:55.852 --> 22:57.243
of whatever the hell this is.

22:57.268 --> 22:59.736
- This about to have me right.
- Right?

22:59.761 --> 23:02.601
- What?
- Drink the rest of mine. I'll get us one.

23:02.626 --> 23:04.042
On me.

23:17.637 --> 23:18.787
Davis?

23:25.077 --> 23:26.077
Hey.

23:31.417 --> 23:33.217
Davis!

23:33.242 --> 23:34.729
Davis! Aah!

23:34.754 --> 23:37.439
- Davis! Davis!
- Oh, Noah, Noah, Noah, no, no, no, no.

23:37.464 --> 23:39.346
I'm sorry, man! I'm sorry.

23:39.371 --> 23:41.609
- Noah, Noah, Noah, Noah, Noah, hey.
- Sit him down. Sit him down.

23:41.633 --> 23:42.925
No, no, it's just a nightmare.

23:42.950 --> 23:44.052
- I got you. I got you, son.
- I'm sorry.

23:44.076 --> 23:45.780
- It's okay.
- This is a...

23:45.805 --> 23:48.130
he a certified opiate doctor, all right?

23:48.155 --> 23:50.280
He's Dr. Feel. He helped me
when I was going through it.

23:50.304 --> 23:52.078
- He's clearly in full-blown withdrawal.
- What do we need to do?

23:52.102 --> 23:53.579
We got to take him to a hospital?

23:53.956 --> 23:55.334
- I really think we should.
- We're leaving,

23:55.358 --> 23:56.697
- we're leaving.
- No, no, no, no, no.

23:56.721 --> 23:58.235
I got it, Pop. I can do it.

23:58.260 --> 24:01.689
- I can fight it.
- I can't let you kill yourself to do this, man.

24:01.714 --> 24:02.995
I've got to be strong for my son.

24:03.019 --> 24:04.525
I've done everything wrong.

24:04.550 --> 24:06.928
He didn't deserve it.
So if I got to be sick,

24:06.953 --> 24:08.630
if I got to hit the bottom, I'll do it.

24:08.654 --> 24:09.820
I got to do it.

24:10.340 --> 24:12.886
- Oh, come on, Pop, please.
- I know.

24:12.911 --> 24:15.552
All those lessons, all those lessons
you tried to teach me,

24:15.577 --> 24:17.713
how to be a man, this
is the one that counts.

24:17.738 --> 24:20.121
No, no, I know that look in
your eye... that's the same look

24:20.146 --> 24:22.303
I had when I came back
to get you, all right?

24:22.327 --> 24:24.096
- I can do it.
- You can do this.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.536
Okay?

24:25.538 --> 24:27.196
You can do it.

24:27.573 --> 24:29.461
You can do this.

24:29.486 --> 24:32.362
Simone, I will talk to her,
but you know your sister.

24:32.736 --> 24:34.220
I'll try. I will try.

24:34.502 --> 24:35.751
All right. Bye.

- Yeah.

25:11.809 --> 25:13.169
It seemed like that phone call was

25:13.193 --> 25:14.433
stressing you out a little bit.

25:14.612 --> 25:15.986
You okay?

25:15.988 --> 25:17.205

to make that go away forever...

25:27.183 --> 25:30.161

You and me both.

26:06.455 --> 26:07.714
Wow.

26:09.133 --> 26:10.491
Whew!

26:11.193 --> 26:12.451
I need a moment.

26:12.476 --> 26:14.708
And a shot.

26:18.284 --> 26:20.000
I don't usually do this.

26:24.469 --> 26:25.740
Who's judging, huh?

26:31.053 --> 26:33.762
You know... tomorrow we can go back

26:33.787 --> 26:35.965
to our big and complicated lives.

26:37.019 --> 26:38.278
But tonight...

26:39.991 --> 26:41.667
we're just two strangers.

26:53.552 --> 26:55.119
This is where Mommy works.

26:55.997 --> 26:57.287
What you think of this?

26:57.312 --> 26:58.670
Hey, I'll talk to you later.

26:58.695 --> 27:00.466
Hey, Star, I need to talk to you.

27:00.491 --> 27:03.069
- 'Sup?
- Simone told me about what's going on,

27:03.094 --> 27:05.304
how you've been pushing it
too hard with your voice.

27:06.123 --> 27:07.715
Pushing yourself too damn hard.

27:07.833 --> 27:09.733
Carlotta, I'm fine.

27:09.735 --> 27:11.637
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm performing tomorrow.

27:11.662 --> 27:13.420
I'm not bowing down to Amber Drake.

27:14.053 --> 27:16.626
Okay. Well, then hit
a middle C for me real quick.

27:16.651 --> 27:19.066
- It's in your range.
- Carlotta, come on.

27:19.091 --> 27:21.954
- Come on, you got it.
- I don't got to prove nothing to you.

27:21.979 --> 27:23.378
Or Simone or Alex.

27:23.403 --> 27:24.511
Look...

27:24.536 --> 27:26.936
only thing you need to
be worried about right now

27:26.961 --> 27:30.039
is taking care of yourself and your son.

27:30.064 --> 27:31.815
You don't need to be worried
about that performance.

27:31.839 --> 27:33.960
That performance is how
I'm taking care of Davis.

27:33.985 --> 27:35.657
Or is it how you're dodging your guilt?

27:37.009 --> 27:39.618
Look, I know what it's
like to be locked up in jail

27:39.643 --> 27:41.687
and have somebody else raising your son,

27:42.571 --> 27:44.433
missing out on all those firsts.

27:45.116 --> 27:48.034
But until you can admit
that and deal with that,

27:48.357 --> 27:51.058
you've gonna be chasing
down all the wrong things.

28:00.587 --> 28:03.338
- Here we go.
- Oh, no, look, if you made this,

28:03.363 --> 28:05.444
then I know it's got pork in it,
and you know I'm vegan.

28:05.468 --> 28:07.413
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I don't
care nothing about no vegan.

28:07.437 --> 28:08.717
This is double bacon and ham...

28:08.742 --> 28:10.766
that's how you're gonna get
your strength back, son.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.093
Yeah, well, I'm gonna need it.

28:12.118 --> 28:14.038
'Cause I feel like I'm
coming back from the dead.

28:14.617 --> 28:15.766
Let me tell you something.

28:16.518 --> 28:19.487
Watching you rise up and deal
with your demons the way you have,

28:19.638 --> 28:20.916
- it inspires me.
- Yeah.

28:21.429 --> 28:22.753
Struggling through this has...

28:23.422 --> 28:25.109
it made me realize I've
been blaming everyone else

28:25.133 --> 28:27.033
for the things that
happened to me in my life.

28:27.058 --> 28:28.577
Don't beat yourself up too bad, man.

28:29.380 --> 28:31.085
We all got our shortcomings.

28:31.110 --> 28:33.713
It's how we deal with those,
that's what really counts.

28:35.198 --> 28:36.507
Look, Pop...

28:38.212 --> 28:39.786
thank you for seeing me through this.

28:42.453 --> 28:43.512
I love you.

28:45.189 --> 28:46.687
- All right, okay, I'll talk to you later.
- Oh.

28:46.711 --> 28:48.119
Truth be told, though,

28:48.281 --> 28:50.326
I couldn't have got
through this without Bruce.

28:50.351 --> 28:52.094
That's who we really
need to thank right there.

28:52.118 --> 28:54.039
- Thank you, Bruce.
- Oh, so y'all finally trying to give

28:54.063 --> 28:55.516
a bitch some damn credit around here.

28:55.540 --> 28:57.131
- Hey, we try, we try.
- Y'all try, uh-huh.

28:57.155 --> 28:59.411
No, I just got off with Carlotta. Um,

28:59.935 --> 29:01.683
the ASA producers want to make sure

29:01.708 --> 29:03.528
you're coming to the
nominee luncheon, but...

29:03.553 --> 29:05.895
- Oh, that's great.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.557
The music business is on hold for now.

29:07.582 --> 29:08.879
Wait, wait, come on, Pop,

29:08.904 --> 29:09.934
that's-that's the nominee luncheon.

29:09.958 --> 29:11.367
If I don't show up, they're gonna talk.

29:11.391 --> 29:12.574
Let 'em talk.

29:13.157 --> 29:14.856
Worrying about this mess got
you here in the first place.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.785
Listen to me... I'm making sure

29:16.810 --> 29:18.556
- this never happens again.
- And it won't.

29:18.581 --> 29:19.906
Never happens again.

29:19.931 --> 29:22.273
You're gonna be battling
addiction your whole life.

29:22.298 --> 29:23.516
You want to win?

29:23.891 --> 29:26.437
You got to fight it 24 hours a day.

29:26.462 --> 29:28.532
- You ain't ready.
- I've been detoxing, all right?

29:28.557 --> 29:30.123
I've-I've detoxed.

29:30.190 --> 29:31.596
I need to take care of my business.

29:31.621 --> 29:33.956
- I need to take care of Davis.
- Listen here.

29:34.563 --> 29:36.237
You trying to take care of your son?

29:36.262 --> 29:37.750
I'm taking care of mine.

29:37.775 --> 29:40.570
- Come on, man.
- I'm taking care of mine right now.

29:40.595 --> 29:43.589
You want to fight me on this one?
All right, let's go.

29:50.797 --> 29:51.904
Hello.

29:52.156 --> 29:54.156
So, what'd the doctor say?

29:54.190 --> 29:55.601
He said I'm all good to perform.

29:55.626 --> 29:57.201
Girl, you know that you a damn liar...

29:57.226 --> 29:58.772
I just got off the phone
with the doctor,

29:58.796 --> 30:00.794
okay, and he said
that you need to be resting.

30:00.819 --> 30:02.236
Well, then I'm-a sue him.

30:02.261 --> 30:03.934
'Cause he shouldn't
be telling my business.

30:03.958 --> 30:06.521
Star, you and Davis
are my business, okay?

30:06.546 --> 30:09.254
Your health is way more important
than this nominee luncheon.

30:09.279 --> 30:11.546
That's why me and Alex
have made the decision.

30:11.571 --> 30:12.870
And what's that?

30:12.895 --> 30:14.698
You're not performing with us.

30:15.815 --> 30:17.263
You're performing without me?

30:17.288 --> 30:19.874
If that means getting
a shot at ASA, then...

30:19.899 --> 30:20.907
It won't.

30:20.932 --> 30:23.297
Star, you think that we can't
do anything without you?

30:23.837 --> 30:25.154
I didn't say that.

30:25.179 --> 30:27.114
- This is Take 3.
- Look, a lot of things

30:27.139 --> 30:28.265
have changed since you've been gone.

30:28.289 --> 30:30.237
I've had to grow up.
Alex is a superstar.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.571
And you can't just put
yourself into everything.

30:32.596 --> 30:34.756
It's a Take 3 performance.

30:35.450 --> 30:37.116
- I'm singing.
- No, you're not.

30:37.141 --> 30:38.592
You are outnumbered: two against one.

30:38.616 --> 30:39.663
You're not singing.

30:39.688 --> 30:40.895
We made our decision.

30:41.423 --> 30:42.650
Okay? I'm out.

30:42.675 --> 30:44.182
- Alex...
- So am I.

30:44.207 --> 30:47.143
If you walk out that door,

30:47.168 --> 30:49.493
you might as well find
someplace else to stay.

30:49.518 --> 30:51.926
You know that baby's crying
'cause his diaper's wet, right?

30:55.074 --> 30:57.660
Good luck.

31:04.980 --> 31:06.187
♪ Watch what you say to me ♪

31:06.212 --> 31:08.320
♪ I do not have no more time ♪

31:08.345 --> 31:10.128
♪ Don't say that you love me ♪

31:12.378 --> 31:13.753
♪ So watch what you say to me... ♪

31:14.139 --> 31:15.972
That's right, take it all in.

31:16.090 --> 31:18.320
You've worked your ass off for it.

31:18.345 --> 31:19.928
You fought like hell.

31:20.320 --> 31:21.587
Since day one.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.165
The minute I met Alex,
I knew we'd be here.

31:25.783 --> 31:27.610
But now I feel like
I'm on the sidelines.

31:28.954 --> 31:30.865
I was so close to getting it, Carlotta.

31:31.422 --> 31:33.465
I was so close I could taste it.

31:33.490 --> 31:35.905
And now it's killing you
'cause you're not in control.

31:37.186 --> 31:39.514
Star, you've got to listen to your body.

31:39.539 --> 31:41.554
Let the girls get
the shine for y'all today.

31:41.579 --> 31:42.988
That's not what I do.

31:43.567 --> 31:45.919
I'm not used to that, sitting
back and doing nothing.

31:46.737 --> 31:48.918
Even with my own son, Carlotta.

31:48.943 --> 31:51.793
I watch Simone. Simone knows
everything that Davis needs.

31:51.818 --> 31:53.146
And I should be able to do that.

31:53.171 --> 31:54.754
I should be able to take care of him.

31:54.779 --> 31:56.270
I'm the one who took care of her.

31:56.295 --> 31:58.432
Yeah, I'm sure
that seems backwards, but...

31:58.904 --> 32:01.610
you got to meet Davis, your voice,

32:01.635 --> 32:03.785
your career where it's at.

32:03.810 --> 32:05.369
Not where you want it to be.

32:06.816 --> 32:08.292
Even Noah.

32:08.317 --> 32:10.613
- You don't got to defend him to me.
- I'm not defending him.

32:10.637 --> 32:12.597
I'm just saying people are broken.

32:13.247 --> 32:15.869
Y'all are both trying
to be good parents,

32:15.894 --> 32:17.795
but it's not gonna happen
for either one of y'all

32:17.819 --> 32:20.011
until you take some
time and heal yourself.

32:20.905 --> 32:22.200
Look...

32:22.225 --> 32:24.136
this is about a celebration, baby girl.

32:24.675 --> 32:27.034
You're at the American Sound Awards.

32:27.036 --> 32:28.378
You're nominated.

32:28.774 --> 32:30.649
You got to enjoy this moment...

32:31.227 --> 32:32.733
however it is.

32:33.767 --> 32:35.125
Don't think too much.

32:35.150 --> 32:36.539
I'm gonna see you in a minute.

32:36.564 --> 32:38.204
- All right.
- Okay.

32:49.696 --> 32:51.124
Give it up for Amber Drake

32:51.148 --> 32:52.920
and her performance "All to Myself."

32:52.945 --> 32:54.136
You crushed it, Amber.

32:55.506 --> 32:57.024
Let me see you top that.

32:58.970 --> 33:00.388
I want to smack his ass.

33:00.413 --> 33:01.689
Hey, y'all.

33:03.514 --> 33:06.324
All right, Star, please don't
fight us on this. Please.

33:06.326 --> 33:07.459
I'm not here for that.

33:08.157 --> 33:09.943
It took me a while
to admit it, but I get it.

33:11.006 --> 33:14.357
As much as my mind is ready to get
on that stage, my body's just not.

33:14.884 --> 33:16.454
And, uh, I... I see that y'all

33:16.479 --> 33:18.679
were just trying to look
out for me and Davis.

33:19.272 --> 33:21.789
I mean, yeah, we just want
what's best for y'all both.

33:23.701 --> 33:24.952
Also...

33:26.097 --> 33:29.349
I don't really want to live
in that big old loft by myself

33:29.374 --> 33:31.533
'cause I hear noises at night and...

33:31.558 --> 33:34.352
Bitch, please. You know that I wasn't
gonna go back to that nasty RV.

33:34.377 --> 33:36.928
I knew it. I knew you were bluffing.

33:36.953 --> 33:38.753
Up next, performing a smash hit

33:38.778 --> 33:40.114
from their sophomore album,

33:40.139 --> 33:42.998
nominated for Best Pop Album, Take 3!

33:44.636 --> 33:45.934
Go give 'em that work.

33:45.959 --> 33:47.707

35:49.246 --> 35:51.854
I would like to also order
some, uh, casket spray.

35:52.309 --> 35:53.410
Thank you.

35:58.582 --> 35:59.998
How do you feel, Ma?

36:00.023 --> 36:01.307
I'm tired.

36:01.332 --> 36:02.534
We all are.

36:04.811 --> 36:06.692
That's kind of what I want
to talk to you about.

36:08.611 --> 36:10.586
I need to put this thing
with Daddy behind me.

36:10.611 --> 36:12.321
Lottie, I don't have
time for this right now.

36:12.345 --> 36:13.620
Daddy is dead.

36:14.580 --> 36:15.836
And I don't want to lose...

36:15.861 --> 36:18.187
any more time with you behind this.

36:18.759 --> 36:20.317
But I don't want to sugarcoat it

36:20.342 --> 36:22.742
and act like it never happened
when we both know it did.

36:25.881 --> 36:27.907
You didn't protect me as a child

36:27.932 --> 36:30.616
and you didn't believe
me, and that scarred me.

36:30.724 --> 36:32.691
I'm not hiding my scars.

36:32.810 --> 36:34.860
I'm not concealing 'em for nobody.

36:35.444 --> 36:36.587
Not anymore.

36:36.705 --> 36:40.916
Not to make somebody
comfortable about my truth.

36:43.153 --> 36:46.872
If I hadn't been running the streets

36:47.325 --> 36:49.000
when you guys were growing up,

36:49.759 --> 36:51.566
I could have done something.

36:51.829 --> 36:53.614
I should have done something.

36:54.589 --> 36:58.563
But, baby, I didn't do
a thing, and I'm so sorry, baby.

36:58.588 --> 36:59.770
I'm so sorry.

36:59.795 --> 37:00.963
I'm sorry.

37:02.881 --> 37:04.106
It's okay.

37:16.677 --> 37:18.848
I'm glad to see you
getting some closure, sis.

37:18.873 --> 37:20.331
I know it hasn't been easy.

37:21.050 --> 37:24.067
Yeah, well, this is more of a celebration
of the living than the dead.

37:24.187 --> 37:26.386
I feel like we finally got
a chance to move forward.

37:26.388 --> 37:27.638
For real this time.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.006
Well, amen to that.

37:31.401 --> 37:33.085
Ooh, I need some air.

37:33.110 --> 37:35.181
You know how it gets when we're
in one place at one time.

37:35.205 --> 37:36.796
All of us. Okay?

37:36.821 --> 37:39.445
The ASA producers loved what
you ladies did at the luncheon.

37:39.470 --> 37:40.632
Even without Star.

37:40.657 --> 37:43.343
Okay, so why does it sound like
there's a "but" in your voice?

37:43.376 --> 37:45.696
They gave Amber the performance
at the awards show.

37:45.721 --> 37:47.349
Damn, man.

37:47.374 --> 37:49.104
Y'all could still win that category.

37:49.129 --> 37:50.987
The ASA is yours if you ask me.

37:51.012 --> 37:52.491
We just got to get
you in fighting shape.

37:52.515 --> 37:54.178
I got a doctor's appointment on Tuesday.

37:54.203 --> 37:55.735
Okay, since we're not
performing at the ASAs,

37:55.759 --> 37:57.159
does it really matter anyway?

37:57.184 --> 38:00.627
Bitch, yes, it always
matters if we get an award.

38:00.652 --> 38:03.443
Okay, bitch, we'll just put
some Auto-Tune in your voice.

38:03.468 --> 38:05.824
Stop. That's not funny.

38:05.849 --> 38:07.690
- I was kidding.
- Just...

38:07.715 --> 38:09.434
- I need a drink.
- I'm right here with you.

38:09.458 --> 38:10.760
- I need one, too.
- Let's go.

38:10.785 --> 38:12.700
- What you want?
- Give me a shot of something.

38:12.725 --> 38:13.777
You want a double shot?

38:13.802 --> 38:15.109
Nah, I don't think I can.

38:15.134 --> 38:18.135
- I've always been a Mixed Harmony fan.
- Ah.

38:18.160 --> 38:21.505
It's like your voice has conviction

38:21.530 --> 38:23.864
and a whole lot of emotion.

38:23.889 --> 38:25.856
When I was growing up,
they called that soul.

38:25.881 --> 38:27.505
Felt like pain to me.

38:27.530 --> 38:29.431
Well, some people are born with it

38:29.950 --> 38:33.143
and some people get it
through life experiences.

38:33.170 --> 38:36.533
I know you, Leon, and
I want to protect these girls.

38:37.158 --> 38:39.422
Okay, Leon, fine, we have a deal.

38:39.447 --> 38:41.848
I'll manage the girls
and you get the money.

38:42.654 --> 38:45.199
But if you so much as
wink at those girls,

38:45.224 --> 38:47.761
I'll cut your black ass
with no second thought.

38:47.786 --> 38:50.051
I know we're cousins,
but you've always been

38:50.076 --> 38:51.222
like an auntie to me.

38:51.247 --> 38:54.048
And the thing that
I admire most about you

38:54.073 --> 38:55.931
is you always keep it real.

38:56.302 --> 38:57.794
So I'm-a ask you this:

38:57.819 --> 39:00.078
where does that pain come from?

39:04.678 --> 39:05.837
Rashad.

39:08.073 --> 39:12.385
My father... was many
things to different people.

39:12.410 --> 39:14.710
- To you, he brought you to Christ.
- Yeah.

39:14.735 --> 39:17.285
My sister Cassie,
he treats like royalty.

39:19.215 --> 39:23.141
Me, he sexually assaulted

39:23.166 --> 39:24.855
on more than one occasion.

39:26.518 --> 39:29.957
So the pain you hear in my voice
is from years of hiding

39:29.982 --> 39:32.499
and concealing those
experiences with him.

39:33.379 --> 39:34.588
I'm sorry.

39:36.091 --> 39:38.558
I know. I know.

39:41.349 --> 39:44.360
He was a flawed human being
just like the rest of us.

39:44.385 --> 39:45.635
And stay away from the club.

39:45.660 --> 39:47.740
