WEBVTT

00:07.083 --> 00:09.167
OKAY, TECTON, YOU SEEM

00:07.083 --> 00:09.167
PERFECTLY HEALTHY.

00:09.209 --> 00:10.834
GO AHEAD AND CHANGE BACK

00:09.209 --> 00:10.834
INTO YOUR SUIT.

00:14.083 --> 00:16.042
WOW, THAT WAS FAST.

00:16.082 --> 00:18.042
IT TAKES ME, LIKE,

00:16.082 --> 00:18.042
FIVE MINUTES

00:18.083 --> 00:21.459
JUST TO FIGURE OUT WHICH WAY

00:18.083 --> 00:21.459
TO PUT ON MY UNDERWEAR.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.083
DANG IT.

00:24.292 --> 00:26.042
IF ALL MY TESTS ARE NORMAL,

00:26.083 --> 00:28.000
WHY AM I GETTING

00:26.083 --> 00:28.000
ALL THESE HEADACHES?

00:28.042 --> 00:29.542
COULD BE STRESS.

00:29.584 --> 00:32.042
EVER SINCE MEGAHERTZ

00:29.584 --> 00:32.042
ESCAPED FROM MIGHTY MAX PRISON,

00:32.083 --> 00:34.459
YOU'VE HAD A LOT ON

00:32.083 --> 00:34.459
YOUR TECTONIC PLATE.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.125
YOU KNOW WHAT

00:34.500 --> 00:36.125
YOU COULD USE?

00:36.167 --> 00:38.876
A ME DAY?

00:38.918 --> 00:41.042
NO, A SIDEKICK.

00:41.083 --> 00:44.250
A SIDEKICK TO SUPPORT YOU

00:41.083 --> 00:44.250
AND BE THERE AT YOUR

00:41.083 --> 00:44.250
BECK AND CALL.

00:44.292 --> 00:46.209
SOUNDS INTERESTING.

00:46.250 --> 00:49.042
I'D HAVE TO FIND THE RIGHT

00:46.250 --> 00:49.042
PERSON FOR THE JOB, BUT WHO?

00:49.083 --> 00:51.417
HA, I DON'T KNOW.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.417
SOMEONE LOYAL,

00:51.459 --> 00:53.042
SOMEONE BRAVE.

00:55.918 --> 00:58.959
SOMEONE ACUTELY AWARE OF

00:55.918 --> 00:58.959
HIS SURROUNDINGS.

01:01.500 --> 01:02.959
SOMEONE LIKE HIM.

01:04.083 --> 01:06.000
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE

01:04.083 --> 01:06.000
TO BE MY SIDEKICK?

01:08.542 --> 01:11.334
YES. TOTALLY.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.459
WHAT? HE GETS TO

01:11.375 --> 01:13.459
BE YOUR SIDEKICK

CAN SOMEONE HELP ME,

02:13.042 --> 02:16.167
BECAUSE SOMEBODY STABBED

02:13.042 --> 02:16.167
ME IN THE BACK.

02:16.209 --> 02:20.000
THEY SHOULD PROBABLY

02:16.209 --> 02:20.000
FINISH HELPING HIM FIRST.

02:22.083 --> 02:26.334
YEAH, WELL, MY WOUND'S

02:22.083 --> 02:26.334
DEEPER BECAUSE IT CAME

02:22.083 --> 02:26.334
FROM A FRIEND.

02:26.375 --> 02:29.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE

02:26.375 --> 02:29.000
GONNA BE TECTON'S SIDEKICK.

02:29.042 --> 02:30.709
YOU KNOW THAT'S ALWAYS

02:29.042 --> 02:30.709
BEEN MY LIFELONG DREAM.

02:30.751 --> 02:33.542
OH, COME ON, THAT'S

02:30.751 --> 02:33.542
NEVER BEEN YOUR

02:30.751 --> 02:33.542
LIFELONG DREAM.

02:33.584 --> 02:35.500
OLIVER, I HEAR TECTON

02:33.584 --> 02:35.500
MADE YOU HIS SIDEKICK.

02:35.542 --> 02:37.125
YOU OKAY, KAZ?

02:37.167 --> 02:40.209
I KNOW THAT'S ALWAYS

02:37.167 --> 02:40.209
BEEN YOUR LIFELONG DREAM.

02:40.250 --> 02:42.042
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY

02:40.250 --> 02:42.042
HE PICKED YOU ANYWAY.

02:42.083 --> 02:43.626
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE

02:42.083 --> 02:43.626
ANY POWERS.

02:43.667 --> 02:46.042
WELL, OBVIOUSLY, TECTON

02:43.667 --> 02:46.042
SEES SOMETHING IN ME,

02:46.083 --> 02:48.417
AND I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T

02:46.083 --> 02:48.417
PASS UP THIS OPPORTUNITY.

02:49.751 --> 02:51.751
FINE. THEN I'M GONNA TAKE

02:51.792 --> 02:54.292
THE ONE THING

02:51.792 --> 02:54.292
YOU CARE MOST ABOUT.

02:55.792 --> 02:58.417
THESE HAND SANITIZERS.

03:02.167 --> 03:04.626
OH, HEY, TECTON,

03:02.167 --> 03:04.626
IT'S YOUR SIDEKICK,

03:04.667 --> 03:06.292
- REPORTING FOR DUTY.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.292
- EXCELLENT.

03:06.334 --> 03:08.292
BUT BEFORE WE BEGIN,

03:06.334 --> 03:08.292
YOU MUST BE SWORN IN

03:08.334 --> 03:10.417
WITH THE TRADITIONAL

03:08.334 --> 03:10.417
OATH OF HEROES

03:10.459 --> 03:12.125
SET FORTH BY

03:10.459 --> 03:12.125
THE ELDERS OF GALTRAX.

03:12.167 --> 03:13.751
REPEAT AFTER ME--

03:13.792 --> 03:15.751
I SWEAR BY

03:13.792 --> 03:15.751
THE ELDERS OF GALTRAX

03:15.792 --> 03:17.751
THAT I PLEDGE

03:15.792 --> 03:17.751
MY UNENDING ALLEGIANCE

03:17.792 --> 03:19.709
TO AID AND SERVE

03:17.792 --> 03:19.709
UNTIL EVIL AND INJUSTICE

03:19.751 --> 03:21.667
ARE ERADICATED FROM

03:19.751 --> 03:21.667
THE UNIVERSE.

03:21.709 --> 03:24.292
SHOULD I SAY IT IN

03:21.709 --> 03:24.292
ORIGINAL GALTRAXIAN?

03:24.334 --> 03:25.626
( speaking Galtraxian )

03:25.667 --> 03:27.751
I'M GOOD, THANKS.

<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">ZOOK CARATH.</font></i>

03:30.459 --> 03:32.626
SO, WHAT'S MY FIRST

03:30.459 --> 03:32.626
ASSIGNMENT?

03:32.667 --> 03:34.125
HELP RESCUE A NORMO

03:32.667 --> 03:34.125
IN DISTRESS?

03:34.167 --> 03:35.709
STOP THE LONDON BRIDGE

03:34.167 --> 03:35.709
FROM FALLING DOWN,

03:35.751 --> 03:38.042
FALLING DOWN,

03:35.751 --> 03:38.042
FALLING DOWN?

03:38.083 --> 03:40.709
I NEED YOU TO HAND WASH

03:38.083 --> 03:40.709
MY UNIFORMS.

03:40.751 --> 03:42.459
THEN GO TO MY HOUSE

03:40.751 --> 03:42.459
AND WATER MY PLANTS,

03:42.500 --> 03:44.667
AND TAKE MY INVISIBLE DOG

03:42.500 --> 03:44.667
TO THE INVISIBLE DOG PARK.

03:44.709 --> 03:47.167
WHAT? BUT THOSE ARE

03:44.709 --> 03:47.167
JUST CHORES.

03:47.209 --> 03:50.459
YEAH. WHAT'D YOU THINK

03:47.209 --> 03:50.459
YOU WERE GONNA DO,

03:50.500 --> 03:52.250
BATTLE SUPER-VILLAINS?

03:52.292 --> 03:55.167
YES. IF YOU WANTED SOMEONE

03:52.292 --> 03:55.167
TO DO YOUR ERRANDS,

03:55.209 --> 03:57.083
WHY WERE YOU LOOKING FOR

03:55.209 --> 03:57.083
SOMEONE BRAVE?

03:57.125 --> 03:59.167
YOU'LL NEED TO BE BRAVE

03:57.125 --> 03:59.167
TO WATER MY PLANTS.

03:59.209 --> 04:00.876
THEY'RE MAN-EATING PLANTS.

04:00.918 --> 04:05.000
OH, ALSO,

04:00.918 --> 04:05.000
FEED MY PLANTS.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.751
I CANNOT BELIEVE IT.

04:12.792 --> 04:15.709
I HEARD A VERY

04:12.792 --> 04:15.709
DISTRESSING RUMOR TODAY.

04:15.751 --> 04:17.541
THAT I'M DATING

04:15.751 --> 04:17.541
A SUPERMODEL?

04:17.584 --> 04:19.584
NO.

04:19.625 --> 04:22.125
OH. BECAUSE THAT'S

04:19.625 --> 04:22.125
A RUMOR I'M TRYING TO START.

04:22.167 --> 04:25.751
WELL, THIS ONE IS JUST

04:22.167 --> 04:25.751
AS HARD TO BELIEVE.

04:25.792 --> 04:28.751
I HEARD THAT OLIVER

04:25.792 --> 04:28.751
IS NOW TECTON'S SIDEKICK.

04:28.792 --> 04:30.667
NO WAY.

04:28.792 --> 04:30.667

ISN'T THE COOLEST

06:21.459 --> 06:22.876
THING EVER.

06:22.918 --> 06:24.542
OLIVER, TECTON'S

06:22.918 --> 06:24.542
LOOKING FOR YOU.

06:24.584 --> 06:26.584
HE WANTS YOU TO EMPTY

06:24.584 --> 06:26.584
HIS WASTEBASKET,

06:26.626 --> 06:29.751
AND BE CAREFUL,

06:26.626 --> 06:29.751
IT'S RADIOACTIVE WASTE.

06:31.042 --> 06:33.792
BEING TECTON'S SIDEKICK

06:31.042 --> 06:33.792
REALLY IS HORRIBLE,

06:33.834 --> 06:35.751
AND DANGEROUS.

06:35.792 --> 06:37.626
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER NOW.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.542
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

06:39.584 --> 06:42.042
TECTON'S A GREAT SUPERHERO,

06:39.584 --> 06:42.042
BUT HE'S RUINING MY LIFE.

06:42.083 --> 06:45.792
WELL, TECHNICALLY, HE SHOULD

06:42.083 --> 06:45.792
BE RUINING MY LIFE.

06:45.834 --> 06:47.918
I THINK MY ADVICE

06:45.834 --> 06:47.918
IS JUST DO WHATEVER I DO

06:47.959 --> 06:50.292
WHEN I'M FACED

06:47.959 --> 06:50.292
WITH ADVERSITY.

06:50.334 --> 06:52.000
SUCK IT UP AND PERSEVERE?

06:52.042 --> 06:53.751
NO! QUIT.

06:53.792 --> 06:56.042
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN ME?

06:57.417 --> 06:58.792
I CAN'T QUIT.

06:58.834 --> 07:00.834
I TOOK THE GALTRAXIAN

06:58.834 --> 07:00.834
OATH OF HEROES.

07:00.876 --> 07:03.459
I AM TOTALLY

07:00.876 --> 07:03.459
IZELFLARPED.

07:03.500 --> 07:07.000
I DON'T KNOW WHY TECTON

07:03.500 --> 07:07.000
EVEN WANTS A SIDEKICK.

07:07.042 --> 07:10.209
THEY'RE THE FIRST THING

07:07.042 --> 07:10.209
A VILLAIN GOES AFTER TO

07:07.042 --> 07:10.209
LURE YOU INTO A TRAP.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.000
THAT'S IT.

07:12.042 --> 07:14.834
THE OATH OF HEROES

07:12.042 --> 07:14.834
PREVENTS YOU FROM QUITTING,

07:14.876 --> 07:16.667
BUT IT DOESN'T PREVENT HIM

07:14.876 --> 07:16.667
FROM FIRING YOU.

07:16.709 --> 07:19.417
ALSO KNOWN AS

07:16.709 --> 07:19.417
THE LOOPHOLE OF HEROES.

07:19.459 --> 07:22.626
- SO?

07:19.459 --> 07:22.626
- ALL WE HAVE TO DO

07:19.459 --> 07:22.626
IS MAKE IT LOOK LIKE

07:22.667 --> 07:23.792
YOU'VE BEEN CAPTURED

07:22.667 --> 07:23.792
BY A VILLAIN.

07:23.834 --> 07:26.250
THEN HE'LL SEE THAT

07:23.834 --> 07:26.250
HAVING YOU WORK FOR HIM

07:26.292 --> 07:28.125
MADE HIM VULNERABLE,

07:26.292 --> 07:28.125
AND HE'LL FIRE YOU.

07:28.167 --> 07:30.250
OKAY. HOPE THIS WORKS,

07:30.292 --> 07:32.375
'CAUSE I CAN'T DO

07:30.292 --> 07:32.375
HIS DIRTY WORK ANYMORE.

07:32.417 --> 07:35.042
HE MADE ME CLEAN HIS SHOWER.

07:35.083 --> 07:36.792
IT'S A METEOR SHOWER.

07:36.834 --> 07:38.626
IT REALLY HURTS,

07:38.667 --> 07:41.459
EVEN WHEN YOU SET

07:38.667 --> 07:41.459
THE SHOWER HEAD TO GENTLE.

07:44.042 --> 07:46.667
I CALL OUR FIRST

07:44.042 --> 07:46.667
MEETING TO ORDER.

07:46.709 --> 07:50.209
ITEM ONE: THE NAME

07:46.709 --> 07:50.209
OF OUR SUPERHERO TEAM.

07:50.250 --> 07:51.542
I GIVE YOU...

07:52.751 --> 07:57.417
MAGNIFICENT MAN

07:52.751 --> 07:57.417
AND WHAT'S-HIS-FACE.

07:57.459 --> 08:00.334
HMM. AS MUCH AS

07:57.459 --> 08:00.334
I LOVE MY COSTUME--

08:00.375 --> 08:03.334
IT JUST SCREAMS FUN--

08:03.375 --> 08:07.209
FIRST WE NEED TO ANSWER

08:03.375 --> 08:07.209
THE MORE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.

08:07.250 --> 08:10.209
- LIKE WHAT?

08:07.250 --> 08:10.209
- LIKE WHO IS

08:07.250 --> 08:10.209
OUR ARCH-NEMESIS?

08:10.250 --> 08:12.542
WHAT WEAPONS AND DEFENSES

08:10.250 --> 08:12.542
DO WE USE,

08:12.584 --> 08:14.667
AND MOST IMPORTANT,

08:14.709 --> 08:16.918
WHOSE TURN IS IT

08:14.709 --> 08:16.918
TO BRING THE SNACKS?

08:16.959 --> 08:20.417
'CAUSE THIS ONION DIP

08:16.959 --> 08:20.417
IS TERRIBLE.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.542
THAT'S A THROAT CULTURE

08:20.459 --> 08:22.542
FROM THE LAB.

08:25.751 --> 08:28.042
FOR ONION DIP,

08:25.751 --> 08:28.042
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

08:28.083 --> 08:29.792
FOR A THROAT CULTURE,

08:28.083 --> 08:29.792
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

08:32.958 --> 08:35.417
AS FAR AS DEFENSES GO,

08:35.458 --> 08:38.583
I THINK WE SHOULD WEAR

08:35.458 --> 08:38.583
PROTECTIVE VESTS ON OUR BACKS.

08:38.626 --> 08:41.458
ON OUR BACKS?

08:38.626 --> 08:41.458
WHY WOULD WE NEED THAT?

08:44.709 --> 08:48.459
FINE, BUT HOW MANY TIMES

08:44.709 --> 08:48.459
IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN?

08:55.876 --> 08:58.626
HUH! MORE OFTEN

08:55.876 --> 08:58.626
THAN YOU THINK.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.459
ALL RIGHT, LET'S

09:02.667 --> 09:04.459
GO OVER THE PLAN.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.250
KAZ, YOU AND SKYLAR

09:04.500 --> 09:06.250
TELL TECTON

09:06.292 --> 09:07.834
THAT MEGAHERTZ CAPTURED

09:06.292 --> 09:07.834
HIS SIDEKICK.

09:07.876 --> 09:09.959
TECTON WILL FEEL

09:07.876 --> 09:09.959
OBLIGATED TO RESCUE ME.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.626
BUT BEFORE HE LEAVES,

09:10.000 --> 09:13.626
I'LL RUN IN SAYING

09:10.000 --> 09:13.626
I BARELY ESCAPED.

09:13.667 --> 09:16.417
THEN, HE'LL SEE

09:13.667 --> 09:16.417
I'M A LIABILITY.

09:13.667 --> 09:16.417
ANY QUESTIONS?

09:16.459 --> 09:18.000
I HAVE A QUESTION.

09:20.083 --> 09:21.667
CAN I HAVE THIS?

09:23.459 --> 09:25.292
BECAUSE I LOOK AWESOME.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.000
OLIVER, I'VE BEEN THINKING.

09:28.042 --> 09:30.459
JUST TELLING TECTON

09:28.042 --> 09:30.459
WON'T BE ENOUGH

09:28.042 --> 09:30.459
TO CONVINCE HIM

09:30.500 --> 09:31.459
THAT YOU'VE BEEN CAPTURED.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.292
I SEE WHERE YOU'RE

09:31.500 --> 09:33.292
GOING WITH THIS.

09:33.334 --> 09:36.334
WE'LL SEND HIM

09:33.334 --> 09:36.334
OLIVER'S HEAD AS PROOF.

09:37.959 --> 09:40.792
WHAT, IT'LL GROW BACK.

09:40.834 --> 09:43.459
NO, IT WON'T.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.667
YOUR HEADS

09:43.500 --> 09:45.667
DON'T GROW BACK?

09:45.709 --> 09:48.792
WOW, YOU NORMOS

09:45.709 --> 09:48.792
ARE SO FRAGILE.

09:50.709 --> 09:54.709
LOOK, AS MUCH AS I HATE

09:50.709 --> 09:54.709
BEING TECTON'S SIDEKICK,

09:54.751 --> 09:57.334
( loudly )

09:54.751 --> 09:57.334
I'VE GROWN RATHER

09:54.751 --> 09:57.334
FOND OF MY HEAD.

09:57.375 --> 09:59.918
SO CAN WE THINK OF

09:57.375 --> 09:59.918
ANOTHER WAY TO CONVINCE TECTON?

09:59.959 --> 10:02.000
I'VE GOT IT.

10:02.042 --> 10:05.083
THEY KEEP OLD

10:02.042 --> 10:05.083
SUPERHERO NEWS NETWORK

10:02.042 --> 10:05.083
REPORTS ON FILE IN MIGHTY MED.

10:05.125 --> 10:07.751
I CAN RE-EDIT THEM TO MAKE

10:05.125 --> 10:07.751
A FAKE STORY ABOUT YOUR CAPTURE.

10:07.792 --> 10:11.042

10:07.792 --> 10:11.042

OH, YOU REMEMBER ME.

10:58.918 --> 11:02.000
IT'S A BAD PLAN,

10:58.918 --> 11:02.000
SKYLAR.

11:02.042 --> 11:03.918
WE AGREE.

11:03.959 --> 11:05.709
I LOVE THIS THING.

11:05.751 --> 11:07.751
IS IT WEIRD

11:05.751 --> 11:07.751
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND?

11:07.792 --> 11:10.125
WHY DO WE HAVE TO DO

11:07.792 --> 11:10.125
ALL OF THE HARD WORK?

11:10.167 --> 11:12.751
MEANWHILE, OLIVER GETS TO JUST

11:10.167 --> 11:12.751
PUT HIS FEET UP AND HANG.

11:15.918 --> 11:17.584
LET ME DOWN!

11:17.626 --> 11:19.042

HEY, UH, TECTON.

11:43.209 --> 11:45.792
NO, THIS NEWS IS EVEN

11:43.209 --> 11:45.792

IT'S TRUE, BUT IT'S

12:11.667 --> 12:14.667
HARDLY NEWSWORTHY.

PLEASE, YOU'RE REALLY

12:14.709 --> 12:17.918
EXPECTING ME TO BELIEVE THIS?

12:24.876 --> 12:27.042
HE GETS TO SWEEP MY HOUSE...

12:27.083 --> 12:28.042
FOR LAND MINES.

12:34.709 --> 12:37.000
YOUR FRIEND JUST TEXTED YOU

12:34.709 --> 12:37.000
THAT YOUR PLAN IS OFF.

12:37.042 --> 12:38.751
PLEASE, JUST LET ME GO.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.709
I'LL LET YOU GO...

12:40.751 --> 12:42.542

12:40.751 --> 12:42.542
COMES TO SAVE YOU,

12:42.584 --> 12:45.918

12:42.584 --> 12:45.918
HIS MORTAL WEAKNESS--

12:45.959 --> 12:49.000
GARGULON GAS.

12:50.876 --> 12:53.042
- ( ringing )

12:50.876 --> 12:53.042
- HELLO.

12:53.083 --> 12:55.042
TECTON, IT'S MEGAHERTZ.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.042
I'VE ABDUCTED

12:55.083 --> 12:57.042
YOUR SIDEKICK.

12:57.083 --> 12:59.876
RIGHT.

12:57.083 --> 12:59.876
I'M SURE YOU HAVE.

12:59.918 --> 13:02.709
AND THIS SOUNDS A LOT

12:59.918 --> 13:02.709
LIKE MEGAHERTZ, KAZ.

13:02.751 --> 13:04.918
IT IS MEGAHERTZ!

13:04.959 --> 13:06.959
AND I SUGGEST

13:04.959 --> 13:06.959
YOU SHOW UP

13:07.000 --> 13:09.876
AT THE OLD INDUSTRIAL

13:07.000 --> 13:09.876
POWER STATION AT 9:00 TONIGHT,

13:09.918 --> 13:12.709

13:09.918 --> 13:12.709
OLIVER ALIVE AGAIN.

13:12.751 --> 13:15.042
ACTUALLY, MEGAHERTZ,

13:15.083 --> 13:18.083
I'M KINDA BUSY,

13:15.083 --> 13:18.083
SO ELECTROCUTE HIM,

13:18.125 --> 13:20.042
PULL HIS ARMS OFF,

13:18.125 --> 13:20.042
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.751
LATER.

13:21.792 --> 13:23.250
( frustrated yell )

13:23.292 --> 13:25.042
HE THINKS I'M

13:23.292 --> 13:25.042
SOMEONE NAMED KAZ.

13:25.083 --> 13:28.751
WHO'S NAMED KAZ,

13:25.083 --> 13:28.751
SERIOUSLY?

13:28.792 --> 13:31.000
WELL, YOUR NAME

13:28.792 --> 13:31.000
IS LESLIE...

13:31.042 --> 13:33.083
ZIP IT!

13:33.125 --> 13:36.709
EVENTUALLY, TECTON

13:33.125 --> 13:36.709
WILL REALIZE YOU'RE MISSING,

13:36.751 --> 13:38.834
AND COME LOOKING FOR YOU.

13:38.876 --> 13:40.834
THEN HE'LL STEP

13:38.876 --> 13:40.834
RIGHT INTO MY TRAP.

13:40.876 --> 13:43.918
( beeping )

13:43.959 --> 13:47.626
UH, LOOKS LIKE

13:43.959 --> 13:47.626
YOUR POWER LEVEL IS LOW.

13:47.667 --> 13:49.626
I HAVE AN IDEA.

13:49.667 --> 13:52.042
HOW ABOUT YOU GO

13:49.667 --> 13:52.042
PLUG YOURSELF IN

13:49.667 --> 13:52.042
AND RECHARGE,

13:52.083 --> 13:55.042
AND I'LL GO GET

13:52.083 --> 13:55.042
TECTON AND TELL HIM

13:52.083 --> 13:55.042
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HIM.

13:55.083 --> 13:57.834
OR, OR, OR...

13:57.876 --> 14:00.876
I COULD STAY HERE

13:57.876 --> 14:00.876
IN THIS CAGE OF ELECTRICITY.

14:07.209 --> 14:09.834
OKAY, I HAVE

14:07.209 --> 14:09.834
A GENIUS PLAN

14:09.876 --> 14:13.876
FOR RESCUING OLIVER

14:09.876 --> 14:13.876
AND PROVING OURSELVES

14:09.876 --> 14:13.876
AS SUPERHEROES.

14:13.918 --> 14:15.876
STEP ONE, RESCUE OLIVER.

14:15.918 --> 14:19.042
STEP TWO, PROVE OURSELVES

14:15.918 --> 14:19.042
AS SUPERHEROES.

14:19.083 --> 14:21.709
I DON'T MEAN

14:19.083 --> 14:21.709
TO BE CRITICAL,

14:21.751 --> 14:23.918
BUT YOUR REASONING

14:21.751 --> 14:23.918
IS SOMEWHAT CIRCULAR.

14:23.959 --> 14:25.667
YOUR FACE IS

14:23.959 --> 14:25.667
SOMEWHAT CIRCULAR.

14:25.709 --> 14:28.000
- ACTUALLY, IT'S

14:25.709 --> 14:28.000
MORE OF AN OVAL--

14:25.709 --> 14:28.000
- I SAID SOMEWHAT CIRCULAR!

14:29.918 --> 14:33.000
NOW, LET'S GET DRESSED

14:46.083 --> 14:49.292
YEAH, IT TOOK A LOT MORE

14:46.083 --> 14:49.292
OUT OF ME THAN I EXPECTED.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.459
MAN, FOR A GUY WITH

15:01.083 --> 15:03.459
A LIMITED WARDROBE,

15:03.500 --> 15:06.292
HE SURE HAS

15:03.500 --> 15:06.292
A LOT OF COAT HANGERS.

15:27.083 --> 15:29.042

15:29.083 --> 15:31.042
HEY, OLIVER,

15:29.083 --> 15:31.042
WHAT'S UP?

15:31.083 --> 15:33.751
I'VE BEEN CAPTURED BY MEGAHERTZ.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.751
HE'S HOLDING ME PRISONER.

15:33.792 --> 15:36.334
GIVE IT UP, OLIVER.

15:33.792 --> 15:36.334
TECTON DIDN'T

15:33.792 --> 15:36.334
GO FOR IT.

15:36.375 --> 15:39.918
I TOLD YOU

15:36.375 --> 15:39.918
YOU SHOULD'VE LET ME

15:36.375 --> 15:39.918
SEND HIM YOUR HEAD.

15:39.959 --> 15:42.000
I'M SERIOUS.

15:42.042 --> 15:45.125
MEGAHERTZ TRAPPED ME

15:42.042 --> 15:45.125
IN AN ELECTRICAL CAGE.

15:42.042 --> 15:45.125
I'LL SHOW YOU.

15:48.042 --> 15:49.459
YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.

HEARING YOU.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.083
THE POWER GRID MUST BE

15:55.000 --> 15:57.083
INTERFERING WITH MY PHONE.

15:57.125 --> 15:59.125
POWER GRIDS.

15:57.125 --> 15:59.125
OF COURSE.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.959
THE ACCIDENT THAT TURNED

15:59.167 --> 16:01.959
MEGAHERTZ INTO A CYBORG

16:02.000 --> 16:03.042

16:07.083 --> 16:09.459
HEROES SHOULDN'T

16:07.083 --> 16:09.459
HAVE A SIDEKICK.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.292
TRUE, BUT IF HE WASN'T

16:09.500 --> 16:12.292
GONNA HAVE A SIDEKICK,

16:09.500 --> 16:12.292
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ME.

16:13.834 --> 16:16.125
DUDE, LET IT GO.

16:16.167 --> 16:18.500
OLIVER, WE'LL CALL TECTON.

16:18.542 --> 16:21.459
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. YOU NEED

16:18.542 --> 16:21.459

16:51.918 --> 16:55.000
KAZ, PLEASE, TELL ME

16:51.918 --> 16:55.000

16:55.042 --> 16:56.959
DON'T WORRY,

16:55.042 --> 16:56.959
I LEFT HIM A MESSAGE

16:57.000 --> 16:58.834
EXPLAINING THAT YOU WERE

16:57.000 --> 16:58.834
ACTUALLY CAPTURED,

16:58.876 --> 17:00.042
AND I TOLD HIM

16:58.876 --> 17:00.042
TO BRING A TARP.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.334
NOT TARP. TRAP.

17:02.375 --> 17:04.541

17:06.959 --> 17:09.291
HEY, TARPS CAN BE

17:06.959 --> 17:09.291
EXTREMELY USEFUL.
