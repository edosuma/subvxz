WEBVTT

00:04.939 --> 00:06.273
Okay, I have
to say this.

00:06.341 --> 00:08.809
We should never
do that again.

00:08.877 --> 00:10.244
Mission's
over, Chuck.

00:10.312 --> 00:11.712
Plan went just fine.

00:11.780 --> 00:12.646
Yeah, except that
your plan necessitated

00:12.714 --> 00:14.448
that we do actual plumbing.

00:14.516 --> 00:17.752
And, for the record, none of
us knows how to actually plumb.

00:17.819 --> 00:19.754
We're going to burn
these jumpsuits, right?

00:19.821 --> 00:21.222
I second Chuck's motion.

00:21.289 --> 00:22.590
No more plumbing
on future missions.

00:22.657 --> 00:24.692
What, are you going
soft, Walker, huh?

00:24.760 --> 00:25.926
It doesn't matter.

00:25.994 --> 00:28.007
Beckman got the intel
she wanted.

00:28.630 --> 00:30.364
Bunch of nancies. Ew.

00:30.432 --> 00:33.667
You need to change
at Casey's?

00:33.735 --> 00:35.403
Huh? Oh, no, thanks.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.838
Actually, Ellie and Awesome
are out of town

00:37.906 --> 00:39.740
looking for a wedding site.

00:39.808 --> 00:41.509
So I'm good to shower
a couple hundred times.

00:41.576 --> 00:42.843
Okay.

00:42.911 --> 00:44.078
I'll see you tomorrow?

00:46.314 --> 00:48.883
Sarah, have you heard anything
from Beckman about Orion?

00:48.950 --> 00:51.385
Uh, not yet.

00:51.453 --> 00:53.087
These things take time.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.590
Gotcha. Okay.

00:56.658 --> 00:59.860
She gets how important it is,
though, right?

00:59.928 --> 01:01.562
I mean, you know,
if we could find Orion,

01:01.630 --> 01:03.364
then maybe I can get all
these secrets out of my head,

01:03.432 --> 01:04.364
and go back to my old life.

01:04.433 --> 01:05.599
She gets it, Chuck.

01:05.667 --> 01:06.734
We all do.

01:06.802 --> 01:09.003
You want that, too, right?

01:09.070 --> 01:10.771
Of course I do, Chuck.

01:10.839 --> 01:12.106
Of course.

01:12.174 --> 01:13.674
I mean, you deserve that.
- Great.

01:13.742 --> 01:17.077
That's-That's great.

01:17.145 --> 01:19.013
I mean, I've only seen that
little bit of Beckman's office

01:19.080 --> 01:20.247
behind her chair,

01:20.315 --> 01:22.349
but I can only
imagine she's got

01:22.417 --> 01:24.285
a whole crack squad
of brilliant analysts

01:24.352 --> 01:26.387
working hard trying to find
Orion in the next room.

01:26.455 --> 01:27.922
Chuck,

01:27.989 --> 01:30.291
leave the search for Orion up to
the team of brilliant analysts.

01:30.358 --> 01:33.227
You need to
get some sleep.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:54.950 --> 01:57.117
Why are you on?

02:32.554 --> 02:35.022
All clear.

02:35.090 --> 02:38.392
Alert FULCRUM-- Orion's gone.

02:38.460 --> 02:40.661
Ice.

02:40.729 --> 02:42.663
He was just here.

02:42.731 --> 02:43.831
Let's go.

02:43.899 --> 02:44.899
Get the computer.

02:59.381 --> 03:01.315
Incoming!
Take cover!

03:01.383 --> 03:03.450
Down, down!
Get down!

03:10.058 --> 03:12.459
Wh...? When did this happen?

03:12.527 --> 03:13.994
During the night.

03:14.062 --> 03:15.462
Look on the bright side.

03:15.530 --> 03:17.197
We don't have to buy TP
for, like, years.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.499
Why start now?

03:18.567 --> 03:20.768
Oh, no.
They defiled our home here.

03:20.835 --> 03:22.870
This is our castle.

03:22.938 --> 03:24.505
Why would someone do this?

03:24.573 --> 03:26.307
Who could do this?

03:26.374 --> 03:27.641
Finally!

03:27.709 --> 03:29.510
Someone tried to clean up
this store.

03:30.912 --> 03:32.513
Barclay.

03:32.581 --> 03:34.615
Assistant Manager Barclay.
Beverly Hills Branch.

03:34.683 --> 03:36.984
Or, for you, "sir."

03:37.052 --> 03:38.986
I should have brought my resume.

03:39.054 --> 03:40.354
Ouch.

03:40.422 --> 03:41.689
So, Bar-clay,

03:41.756 --> 03:42.990
you guys did this, huh?

03:43.058 --> 03:44.258
Clever trick, Bartowski.

03:44.326 --> 03:45.659
We admit nothing.

03:45.727 --> 03:47.661
Although, we are in Burbank.

03:47.729 --> 03:48.929
That should be a crime.

03:50.332 --> 03:51.999
I know, I know.

03:52.067 --> 03:53.400
Okay, Sir Barclay,
hypothetically speaking,

03:53.468 --> 03:54.735
why would someone
like yourself

03:54.803 --> 03:56.670
and your incredibly colorful

03:56.738 --> 04:00.774
and well-coordinated team
do this to our store?

04:00.842 --> 04:02.076
I know why.

04:02.143 --> 04:03.077
Hello, Michael.

04:03.144 --> 04:05.579
Emmett.

04:05.647 --> 04:07.147
Barclay.

04:07.215 --> 04:08.482
You see, Barclay here is upset

04:08.550 --> 04:09.683
that we're getting the new

04:09.751 --> 04:11.018
Roark Instruments laptop

04:11.086 --> 04:12.419
before they do.

04:12.487 --> 04:14.588
We're getting the R7
gaming laptop first?

04:14.656 --> 04:16.390
No one has even seen it yet.
- Bet your britches.

04:16.458 --> 04:17.992
We're the flagship store.

04:18.059 --> 04:19.459
We should get those computers.

04:19.527 --> 04:20.594
Flagship of my ass.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.396
Now get out of here,
Barclay.

04:22.464 --> 04:24.098
You think Morgan
over there is tough?

04:24.165 --> 04:25.265
Wait till you see this guy.

04:30.071 --> 04:31.405
How was that, Michael?

04:31.473 --> 04:33.307
We got to work
on that growl.

04:33.375 --> 04:35.142
Uh, sir,
what are we going to do?

04:35.210 --> 04:36.310
I tell you what we could do.

04:36.378 --> 04:37.411
We could assemble
a counterstrike.

04:37.479 --> 04:38.245
All right,
all I need is a couple kegs

04:38.313 --> 04:39.279
of Silly String, and maybe...

04:39.347 --> 04:41.081
No retaliations.

04:41.149 --> 04:42.516
Calm and collected.

04:42.584 --> 04:43.584
That's the Buy More way.

04:43.652 --> 04:46.186
Now, clean this place up!

04:56.831 --> 04:58.999
Huh.

04:59.067 --> 05:00.634
You feeling okay, computer?

05:08.309 --> 05:12.079
Ah. Ha, ha, ha.

05:12.147 --> 05:13.647
Yeah, okay.
Who's doing this?

05:13.715 --> 05:16.517
Your cleverness has been noted.

05:25.427 --> 05:27.861
Why are we meeting?

05:33.301 --> 05:34.835
You can hear me?

05:45.914 --> 05:47.514
What? Hello?

05:47.582 --> 05:48.916
Hello?

05:48.983 --> 05:50.050
Hey, Chuck!

05:50.118 --> 05:52.553
Hi. Hi. Hi, Sarah.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.987
What was it?

05:54.055 --> 05:55.756
Um...

05:57.726 --> 06:00.194
There's something that I
should probably tell you.

06:00.261 --> 06:02.830
What? What did you say?

06:02.897 --> 06:04.098
I found him.

06:04.165 --> 06:05.632
I found Orion.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.868
Or, actually, he found me

06:07.936 --> 06:09.269
about ten minutes ago
in the Buy More.

06:09.337 --> 06:11.405
He tapped into one of
the Nerd Herd computers

06:11.473 --> 06:13.540
using, I might add,
a very cool kind of hack.

06:13.608 --> 06:15.242
Chuck.

06:15.310 --> 06:16.543
How is that possible?

06:18.346 --> 06:22.716
I-I... It probably has something
to do with my search.

06:22.784 --> 06:24.618
<i>Your</i> what?

06:24.686 --> 06:26.920
Chuck put together everything
he knew about FULCRUM and Orion,

06:26.988 --> 06:29.790
and then he built an
automated Web search.

06:29.858 --> 06:31.759
I think I hit
one of his security nets.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.460
That's not how
this works, Bartowski.

06:33.528 --> 06:34.762
You don't conduct
your own operations.

06:34.829 --> 06:35.796
What did he say?

06:35.864 --> 06:36.997
Orion.

06:37.065 --> 06:38.832
Well, he knows
I'm the Intersect.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.300
And he's going

06:40.368 --> 06:41.702
to send me a computer.

06:41.770 --> 06:43.537
Where's the computer going?

06:43.605 --> 06:44.838
To me.

06:44.906 --> 06:46.373
I-I think.

06:46.441 --> 06:48.008
I don't... We didn't really
nail down the details.

06:48.076 --> 06:50.377
I want that computer
under lock and key.

06:50.445 --> 06:52.379
Orion's computers are nextgen,

06:52.447 --> 06:54.248
capable of overriding
military defenses,

06:54.315 --> 06:55.949
even hijacking
computerized weaponry.

06:56.017 --> 06:59.052
God help us if it falls
into the wrong hands.

07:04.058 --> 07:07.261
Delivery for
Charles I. Bartowski.

07:09.030 --> 07:10.464
What is it?

07:10.532 --> 07:12.232
Says electronics.
A computer?

07:12.300 --> 07:14.001
The Roark 7.

07:14.068 --> 07:16.603
Take that,
Beverly Hills.

07:16.671 --> 07:18.572
I'm Chuck.

07:22.377 --> 07:23.844
You just leave it with me.

07:23.912 --> 07:27.414
Thanks.

07:44.899 --> 07:46.366
# Na-na na-na na-na #

07:46.434 --> 07:49.303
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

07:49.370 --> 07:50.904
# Na-na na-na na-na #

07:50.972 --> 07:52.573
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

07:52.640 --> 07:54.107
# Na-na na-na na-na #

07:54.175 --> 07:57.411
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

08:16.500 --> 08:18.634
Nothing. Orion hasn't
delivered the computer yet.

08:18.702 --> 08:20.303
Do you think he's going
to bring it personally?

08:20.370 --> 08:22.104
No, he's going
to stay away for now.

08:22.172 --> 08:23.973
Got it. Cool.
So we wait.

08:25.709 --> 08:26.843
Why didn't you tell me?

08:26.910 --> 08:29.679
Um...

08:29.746 --> 08:32.381
Chuck, your search for Orion
was a rogue operation.

08:32.448 --> 08:33.616
Do you know
how dangerous that is?

08:34.852 --> 08:36.284
Very.

08:36.352 --> 08:39.722
And I didn't tell you.
- And you didn't tell me.

08:39.789 --> 08:41.424
Okay, you're right.

08:41.491 --> 08:42.892
Completely and totally right.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.561
But, Sarah, I want to get
this thing out of my head

08:45.629 --> 08:46.829
so I can go back
to my old life

08:46.897 --> 08:48.431
and have a chance at
a real relationship.

08:48.498 --> 08:49.832
Do you really think the NSA
and the CIA

08:49.900 --> 08:51.234
are going to be cool with that?

08:51.301 --> 08:54.003
You should have trusted me.

08:58.508 --> 09:00.009
Dude, what am I doing here?
- Come on.

09:00.077 --> 09:01.611
It's in Jeff's office.

09:01.678 --> 09:03.412
Wait. No, no, no.
Jeff's office?

09:03.480 --> 09:04.814
Don't worry.
You got to see this.

09:04.882 --> 09:06.315
No, you don't understand.
I don't want to go

09:06.383 --> 09:08.351
into Jeff's office. It makes
me feel... uncomfortable.

09:08.418 --> 09:10.586
I know. Morgan,
it's that good.

09:14.825 --> 09:16.559
Come on in.

09:16.627 --> 09:18.294
Oh, it's on.

09:19.997 --> 09:22.398
Long time no see, Morgan.

09:22.466 --> 09:23.900
Okay, I'm leaving.

09:23.967 --> 09:25.534
Wait.

09:28.138 --> 09:29.639
Look at this.

09:32.776 --> 09:34.210
What is it?

09:34.278 --> 09:35.611
It's like nothing
I've ever seen before.

09:35.679 --> 09:38.281
Liquid cooled, titanium housing,
over-clocked processor.

09:38.348 --> 09:41.083
Gentlemen, this
is a work of art.

09:41.151 --> 09:42.451
It's the Roark 7.

09:42.519 --> 09:44.854
We're trying it out before
we give it to Big Mike.

09:44.922 --> 09:46.255
You're here
in case we get caught.

09:46.323 --> 09:48.124
Yeah, we figure Big Mike
won't come down too hard

09:48.191 --> 09:50.326
on his boy.
- Thanks.

09:59.403 --> 10:01.103
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
close it, close it.

10:01.171 --> 10:01.971
Big Mike will know
that we turned it on.

10:02.039 --> 10:03.472
No, just say you can't identify.

10:03.540 --> 10:04.507
Should I?
- Yeah.

10:09.012 --> 10:11.781
Uh, yeah, you better believe it.

10:18.822 --> 10:20.790
It's a simulator game.

10:21.625 --> 10:22.959
Who should we target?

10:25.729 --> 10:26.696
Buy More.

10:44.715 --> 10:46.182
Orion has taken control

10:46.249 --> 10:48.818
of a Predator drone
based out of Edwards.

10:48.885 --> 10:50.286
Signal matches one
he used in Hong Kong.

10:50.354 --> 10:52.788
Drone was on an armed
targeting run.

10:52.856 --> 10:54.657
Is there a target?
Please don't say Buy More.

10:54.725 --> 10:56.092
Orion sent you
a computer all right.

10:56.159 --> 10:57.793
It's inside a Predator drone
targeted to kill you.

10:57.861 --> 10:59.862
How thoughtful.

10:59.930 --> 11:01.630
Why would he...
There's no time.

11:01.698 --> 11:03.332
We got to get everybody
out of the store.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.301
Fire alarm. Okay, Chuck, you
stay here and monitor the drone.

11:14.177 --> 11:15.378
boredom.

11:15.445 --> 11:17.313
Feels like we're flying
an actual Predator.

11:17.381 --> 11:18.481
I give it three stars.

11:18.548 --> 11:20.049
Three stars?
You're a cretin.

11:20.117 --> 11:21.784
The details are incredible.
The graphics processor must be

11:21.852 --> 11:23.185
running on...
Hold on a second.

11:23.253 --> 11:24.854
Why are we trying to blow up
our own store here?

11:31.094 --> 11:34.163
Shouldn't we be targeting a
certain Beverly Hills location?

11:44.574 --> 11:46.509
Guys, guys, wait.

11:46.576 --> 11:48.744
The drone is changing direction.

11:48.812 --> 11:49.812
Where's it heading?

11:49.880 --> 11:51.814
Telemetry puts it

11:51.882 --> 11:53.682
at the corner
of Wilshire and Doheny.

11:53.750 --> 11:55.284
That's the Beverly Hills
Buy More.

11:55.352 --> 11:59.655
Why would Orion
target another store?

11:59.723 --> 12:00.956
He wouldn't.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.124
But I know who would.

12:02.192 --> 12:03.259
Look for Morgan.

12:03.326 --> 12:04.360
I'm on my way.

12:11.201 --> 12:12.368
Morgan, call me

12:12.436 --> 12:14.603
as soon as you get this.
Don't think, just hit

12:14.671 --> 12:16.572
the callback button right now.
No sign of Morgan, Jeff or Lester.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.340
Those morons have the computer,
don't they?

12:18.408 --> 12:19.809
Which one dies first?

12:19.876 --> 12:21.911
Look, just go-go-go check

12:21.978 --> 12:24.947
the loading dock, and I'll look
somewhere else. Go, now!

12:25.015 --> 12:27.016
Hold on a second, guys.

12:27.084 --> 12:28.751
It's Chuck again.

12:28.819 --> 12:30.586
Don't answer it;
he's after my computer.

12:30.654 --> 12:32.154
Yeah, but he's called twice; he never does that.
- It could be an emergency.

12:32.222 --> 12:33.722
Why he'd call me,
I have no idea.

12:33.790 --> 12:34.590
No! Morgan, no.

12:34.658 --> 12:36.192
Hey, Chuck.

12:36.259 --> 12:37.359
Hey, hey. Where are you?

12:37.427 --> 12:39.361
Uh, with Lester
in Jeff's office.

12:39.429 --> 12:40.896
It's actually
very nice.

12:40.964 --> 12:42.398
Morgan, you have
to listen to me.

12:42.466 --> 12:44.100
You have to stop playing
with that computer right now.

12:44.167 --> 12:45.101
Uh, why, Chuck?

12:45.168 --> 12:46.635
Buddy, just trust me and do it!

12:46.703 --> 12:47.570
Yeah, sure, Chuck.

12:47.637 --> 12:49.338
We are almost at Beverly Hills.

12:49.406 --> 12:50.606
Time to pull the plug,
all right? Jig is up.

12:50.674 --> 12:51.974
Jeff stop him. Yes!
- Really?

12:53.577 --> 12:54.977
Chuck is our leader!

12:55.045 --> 12:57.246
No, he is your leader
for some weird reason!

12:57.314 --> 12:58.581
Ah! You hurt me!

13:00.851 --> 13:02.885
Give it to me, Lester!

13:02.953 --> 13:04.120
No, no, no!

13:05.755 --> 13:07.189
Chuck, you stop!

13:07.257 --> 13:08.491
You stop right there!
- Ow!

13:18.869 --> 13:20.636
That really hurt.

13:20.704 --> 13:21.804
I want just one of them!

13:21.872 --> 13:23.072
No.

13:23.140 --> 13:26.976
Sarah, you're in
the little boys' room.

13:27.043 --> 13:28.911
Oh.

13:30.814 --> 13:31.947
<i>What the living heck</i>

13:32.015 --> 13:32.948
is going on here?

13:34.217 --> 13:34.950
Is that it?

13:35.018 --> 13:37.019
Is that the Roark 7?

13:37.087 --> 13:38.654
No, uh, actually,
this is...

13:38.722 --> 13:39.788
Yes it is, sir.

13:39.856 --> 13:40.990
We wanted to
take a closer

13:41.057 --> 13:42.558
look at it.
I figured it'd be okay.

13:42.626 --> 13:43.392
It's my fault.
Crazy me.

13:44.361 --> 13:46.095
Nobody touches this computer

13:46.163 --> 13:47.663
until it goes on
display tomorrow.

13:47.731 --> 13:50.633
We are being watched, people!

13:50.700 --> 13:52.201
We can't
screw this up!

13:52.269 --> 13:53.636
Calm and collected.

13:53.703 --> 13:56.605
Calm and collected.

13:56.673 --> 13:58.140
Hmm.

13:58.208 --> 13:59.708
Such ne'er-do-wells
we have here.

13:59.776 --> 14:02.077
Emmett, I want you
to stand guard tonight.

14:02.145 --> 14:04.413
Nobody gets close
to this laptop,

14:04.481 --> 14:05.814
got it?

14:05.882 --> 14:07.216
Affirmative,
Michael.

14:07.284 --> 14:08.784
Barclay and
the Beverly Hills boys

14:08.852 --> 14:10.219
will be
gunning for it.

14:10.287 --> 14:11.954
I want that computer back,
Jeffrey.

14:12.022 --> 14:14.190
It's calling
me, and I must

14:14.257 --> 14:15.491
have it.

14:15.559 --> 14:17.226
An after-hours job.

14:17.294 --> 14:18.594
No problem.

14:22.499 --> 14:24.333
So I guess we know
what our mission is:

14:24.401 --> 14:26.735
rob the Buy More.

14:26.803 --> 14:29.104
Tonight, after
the store closes.

14:29.172 --> 14:31.574
At least nobody else
knows it's here.

14:34.811 --> 14:37.246
Welcome, Vincent.

14:37.314 --> 14:40.482
It's good to see you survived
the Hong Kong incident.

14:40.550 --> 14:42.418
We found Orion.

14:42.485 --> 14:45.921
Picked up a signal matching the
computer he used in Hong Kong.

14:45.989 --> 14:49.658
It originated from a retail
store in Burbank, California.

14:49.726 --> 14:51.260
Is it a Buy
More store?

14:51.328 --> 14:54.363
Yes, it is.

14:54.431 --> 14:56.498
Would you like me
to pick something up for you?

14:56.566 --> 14:57.967
FULCRUM has lost
operatives there.

14:58.034 --> 15:00.669
We believe
it's a CIA substation.

15:00.737 --> 15:02.271
The risk is too
great for an operation.

15:02.339 --> 15:05.774
Sir, madam, you know me.

15:05.842 --> 15:08.377
I can't let this go.

15:08.445 --> 15:11.547
If I don't have your support,
I'll do it myself.

15:11.615 --> 15:13.882
Then proceed, Vincent.

15:13.950 --> 15:15.751
We appreciate
your initiative.

15:22.372 --> 15:24.807
It was a lawless town,

15:24.875 --> 15:27.877
Shane, Marshal Dillon,
Clint Eastwood.

15:29.746 --> 15:32.715
Little girls in comparison

15:32.782 --> 15:34.817
to Milbarge.

15:34.885 --> 15:36.051
Rah!

15:36.119 --> 15:37.753
Oh, God.

15:48.832 --> 15:50.633
Okay, what's the plan?

15:50.700 --> 15:52.167
You got us into this mess,
why don't you

15:52.235 --> 15:53.502
come up with the plan for once.

15:53.570 --> 15:55.871
Okay. All right.

15:55.939 --> 15:59.141
You two distract Emmett with
your super spy skills while I go

15:59.209 --> 16:00.542
hit Big Mike's office.

16:00.610 --> 16:02.211
He keeps the combination
of the safe in his desk.

16:02.279 --> 16:03.812
Keeps the combination
in his office?

16:03.880 --> 16:05.714
It's a Buy More, Casey. Relax.

16:07.417 --> 16:09.184
Oh, no, no, no, no.

16:09.252 --> 16:10.653
There are no guns in my plan.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.321
Okay? As annoying
as Emmett is,

16:12.389 --> 16:13.188
you cannot
shoot, tranq,

16:13.256 --> 16:15.691
or karate chop him in any way.

16:15.759 --> 16:17.693
You put him in charge.

16:17.761 --> 16:20.095
All right.

16:20.163 --> 16:21.497
Let's go.

16:26.870 --> 16:29.371
Hello?

16:31.241 --> 16:33.542
Ooh, that better not be a rat.

16:42.953 --> 16:44.954
I'm hearing things.

16:45.021 --> 16:45.988
Just like Fresno.

16:46.056 --> 16:47.256
Just like Fresno.

16:57.133 --> 16:58.867
He's gonna find us.
We're gonna get fired.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.303
I'll be turning tricks again
by the end of the week.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.040
I can throw my voice.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.675
A diversion, good idea.
Go, go, go.

17:07.743 --> 17:08.310
Caw-caw.

17:09.980 --> 17:11.146
Oh, my God, what was that?

17:12.348 --> 17:14.650
Did... did you throw your voice?

17:14.718 --> 17:15.884
I think.

17:21.191 --> 17:22.324
Seven hours to go.

17:24.060 --> 17:26.261
I almost got it, Casey.

17:26.329 --> 17:27.695
I'm in the office.

17:27.763 --> 17:30.466
Hey, way to go, Jeffrey.

17:30.533 --> 17:32.334
So throwing your voice really
turned out great, didn't it?

17:32.402 --> 17:33.669
Huh? What other
tricks do you know?

17:33.737 --> 17:34.770
When you saw a
woman in half,

17:34.838 --> 17:36.405
do you actually saw her in half?

17:40.043 --> 17:43.312
Listen, I thought I lost you.

17:43.380 --> 17:45.047
I'm scared, man.

17:45.115 --> 17:47.082
I think I wet my pants.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.384
Just a little.

18:22.152 --> 18:24.219
Ha.

18:24.287 --> 18:25.921
Ha. What are the chances?

18:25.989 --> 18:28.590
Two burglars robbing
the same place?

18:28.658 --> 18:30.426
What a funny coincidence.

18:30.493 --> 18:31.994
Hilarious.

18:32.062 --> 18:33.362
Give me the computer.

18:34.898 --> 18:35.998
We got to get out of here.

18:36.066 --> 18:37.132
Lester, come on.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.901
Let's go. Oh.

18:42.739 --> 18:44.740
I've tried to help you
over the years, Jefferson.

18:44.808 --> 18:47.176
I've drowned myself
trying to help you.

18:47.243 --> 18:48.444
But you're a moron.

18:48.511 --> 18:49.745
In the end, that's
what you are.

18:49.813 --> 18:51.346
You're a Buy Moron.

18:51.414 --> 18:52.981
Do you get that?

18:53.049 --> 18:54.750
Do you?
- Lester.

18:54.818 --> 18:56.985
Hang on a sec, Jeff,
I just got to...

18:58.188 --> 19:00.689
Hi.

19:00.757 --> 19:01.990
Who are you?

19:04.160 --> 19:05.327
Run! Run! Run!

19:05.395 --> 19:07.663
Run! Run!
Run! Run!

19:07.730 --> 19:09.031
Die, intruders!

19:09.099 --> 19:10.499
Die!

19:10.567 --> 19:11.800
Mother! Mother!

19:11.868 --> 19:12.835
Mother?! Mother?!

19:12.902 --> 19:13.936
That's right.

19:14.003 --> 19:15.804
Nobody messes with
this Buy More.

19:15.872 --> 19:17.039
Nobody.

19:17.107 --> 19:19.074
You want to mess with me
and my store?

19:19.142 --> 19:22.244
Well, bring it on, bitches!

19:25.648 --> 19:26.982
That felt good.

19:27.050 --> 19:27.916
Casey!
- Huh?

19:27.984 --> 19:29.418
I had to that.

19:29.486 --> 19:30.285
Guys.

19:33.289 --> 19:34.923
You get one chance.

19:34.991 --> 19:36.558
Drop your guns.

19:36.626 --> 19:38.994
Um, sir,
they don't have any guns.

19:39.062 --> 19:40.429
I personally
put this mission together,

19:40.497 --> 19:41.763
and I forbade them from packing.

19:41.831 --> 19:43.565
Why would you do that?

19:43.633 --> 19:44.566
I don't know.

19:44.634 --> 19:45.834
I just, you know--

19:45.902 --> 19:47.369
I think that guns
make things too easy,

19:47.437 --> 19:49.238
and I like my spies to be tough.

19:49.305 --> 19:50.205
Look, you're
not gonna

19:50.273 --> 19:51.440
shoot anyone, right?

19:52.775 --> 19:54.643
It would be unprofessional
not to.

19:59.983 --> 20:01.383
You had a gun?!

20:01.451 --> 20:02.551
I always have a gun.

20:02.619 --> 20:04.153
Don't you
dare move.

20:05.722 --> 20:06.355
Guys...

20:13.329 --> 20:14.830
I-I really didn't
need to see that.

20:19.402 --> 20:20.903
Oh, sweet Bolonia.

20:20.970 --> 20:24.139
Who's your Big Mike?
Who's your Big Mike?

20:31.748 --> 20:33.315
I'm busy, Emmett. What?!

20:33.383 --> 20:35.150
Okay, be
right there.

20:37.387 --> 20:39.321
Morgan! Wake up!

20:39.389 --> 20:40.756
We got trouble at the store!

20:40.823 --> 20:42.925
Beverly Hills
made their move!

20:42.992 --> 20:45.227
Oh, thank God.

20:46.462 --> 20:48.297
I contacted Langley.

20:48.364 --> 20:50.232
They'll send a team to dispose
of the body tomorrow.

20:50.300 --> 20:51.600
Guys, I don't understand.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.068
That was supposed to be
the easiest mission ever.

20:53.136 --> 20:54.403
How did a FULCRUM agent show up?

20:54.470 --> 20:56.071
How did he know
the computer was there?

20:56.139 --> 20:57.272
Who else knows about it?

20:57.340 --> 20:58.774
All right,
well, we got

20:58.841 --> 21:00.576
plenty of scary questions,
now let's get some answers.

21:00.643 --> 21:02.511
Don't touch that computer.

21:02.579 --> 21:03.812
Why?

21:03.880 --> 21:05.714
You weren't contacted by Orion.

21:05.782 --> 21:07.082
Uh, what?

21:07.150 --> 21:08.917
Wait, wait. He knew
that I was the Intersect.

21:08.985 --> 21:10.852
Who else could
possibly know that?

21:10.920 --> 21:11.787
FULCRUM.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.121
My analysts believe

21:13.189 --> 21:14.623
you walked into a FULCRUM trap.

21:14.691 --> 21:16.124
Are you certain?

21:16.192 --> 21:17.359
I didn't think...

21:17.427 --> 21:18.594
No, you didn't think.
None of you did.

21:18.661 --> 21:20.996
And you put this entire
operation in jeopardy.

21:21.064 --> 21:22.364
But, General, if it's Orion,

21:22.432 --> 21:24.499
this laptop is the only way
for us to contact him.

21:24.567 --> 21:25.968
Major.
If I could just...

21:26.035 --> 21:27.836
We can't take that risk.

21:27.904 --> 21:29.771
My NSA technicians
will inspect the computer.

21:29.839 --> 21:32.241
Sarah, please.

21:35.278 --> 21:37.980
I'm-I'm sorry, Chuck.

21:38.047 --> 21:39.248
Orders.

21:40.516 --> 21:42.017
General, we don't have time

21:42.085 --> 21:43.752
to send this computer off
to Washington and wait.

21:43.820 --> 21:45.821
If this really is Orion,

21:45.888 --> 21:47.656
he may not contact us again.
- You're right,

21:47.724 --> 21:49.157
we don't have time.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.693
That's why I'm taking over
this operation directly.

21:51.761 --> 21:54.229
I'll be on site within the hour.

21:54.297 --> 21:55.631
What? You're coming here?

21:55.698 --> 21:57.833
Hopefully I won't have
to shut down Operation Bartowski

21:57.900 --> 22:00.669
because of one foolish mistake,

22:00.737 --> 22:02.504
but if FULCRUM knows
who you really are,

22:02.572 --> 22:04.806
pack your bags, Chuck.

22:04.874 --> 22:06.341
You're leaving with me.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.577
Tell your family and friends...

22:09.779 --> 22:11.480
Tell them nothing.

22:16.937 --> 22:18.571
General, I implore you.

22:18.639 --> 22:19.772
Don't use "implore."

22:19.840 --> 22:21.174
Only use words
that you actually use.

22:21.241 --> 22:23.876
Here's why I think
that Orion is legit.

22:23.944 --> 22:25.645
I don't say "legit."
- Chuck.

22:25.712 --> 22:26.846
Is Beckman here?

22:26.914 --> 22:28.548
Uh, she's on her way.

22:28.615 --> 22:30.416
Okay. What about the computer?
- It's inside Castle.

22:30.484 --> 22:32.885
Beckman has a containment unit
en route to move it out.

22:32.953 --> 22:35.888
Guys, look, I am certain that
Orion is not FULCRUM, okay?

22:35.956 --> 22:37.223
This is the real guy.

22:37.291 --> 22:38.658
If I could just get five
to 45 minutes with her,

22:38.725 --> 22:39.826
I could convince
the General.

22:39.893 --> 22:41.394
No, she doesn't want
to see you.

22:41.462 --> 22:43.262
Please just wait
in your room.

22:44.665 --> 22:46.432
Secure the perimeter.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.734
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about my search, but...

22:48.802 --> 22:50.703
It's okay.
I'll explain it to her.

22:50.771 --> 22:52.905
Now, go.

22:55.776 --> 22:56.642
All clear.

23:03.717 --> 23:05.952
Is the asset secure?

23:06.019 --> 23:07.987
Yes, ma'am.

23:08.055 --> 23:10.490
It was a highly
professional team, Michael.

23:10.557 --> 23:11.958
There must have been 30...

23:12.025 --> 23:13.226
40 of them.

23:13.293 --> 23:14.961
They stormed the store.

23:15.028 --> 23:18.764
And they took the new laptop.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.700
What do you think?
Barclay?

23:20.767 --> 23:22.702
Whoever did this broke
some serious laws here, boss.

23:22.769 --> 23:24.103
It's Barclay, all right.

23:24.171 --> 23:25.571
I can smell him all over this.

23:25.639 --> 23:27.540
Hey! We came
as soon as we heard.

23:27.608 --> 23:28.374
Heard what?
Nobody called you.

23:29.877 --> 23:31.177
Mm-hmm. Correct.

23:31.245 --> 23:33.246
Bingo. Yeah, no,
they closed the tap at Benny's,

23:33.313 --> 23:34.380
saw the commotion,
wanted to see what was going on.

23:35.349 --> 23:36.349
I'm calling the police.

23:36.416 --> 23:38.251
Put that phone down.
Oh, God.

23:38.318 --> 23:40.186
We can't let them
get away with this.

23:40.254 --> 23:42.321
Okay, we can't be calm
and collected this time.

23:44.391 --> 23:45.558
Let me see it.

23:48.162 --> 23:49.729
Mm-hmm.

23:50.898 --> 23:53.166
No, Morgan.

23:53.233 --> 23:54.634
We will remain
calm and collected.

23:54.701 --> 23:57.503
We will be calm
and collected

23:57.571 --> 23:59.839
when we go to
Beverly Hills tonight

23:59.907 --> 24:01.274
and we will be
calm and collected

24:01.341 --> 24:03.376
when I use my manager's
code to get into the store.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.844
And then we will be

24:04.912 --> 24:07.146
calm and collected when we

24:07.214 --> 24:08.714
burn that mother loving
store to the ground.

24:23.931 --> 24:25.164
Sir, what exactly
are we doing here?

24:25.232 --> 24:26.399
Payback.

24:26.466 --> 24:27.700
I see.

24:27.768 --> 24:29.468
Does payback involve
illegal activities?

24:29.536 --> 24:30.536
Damn well better.

24:49.156 --> 24:50.823
Hello, this is Chuck speaking.

24:50.891 --> 24:52.124
Hello, Chuck.

24:52.192 --> 24:53.292
Where's my computer?

24:53.360 --> 24:54.760
Orion... Orion?

24:54.828 --> 24:58.030
Um... uh, unfortunately,
your computer

24:58.098 --> 25:00.399
is currently locked up in a
top secret government facility.

25:00.467 --> 25:01.667
You have to get it.

25:01.735 --> 25:02.969
I can't.

25:03.036 --> 25:04.437
My handlers think
that you're FULCRUM,

25:04.504 --> 25:06.939
and to be perfectly honest,
I'm on the fence myself.

25:07.007 --> 25:07.940
I'm not FULCRUM.

25:08.008 --> 25:09.175
Thanks.

25:09.243 --> 25:10.443
Thanks, I'm glad
we cleared that up,

25:10.510 --> 25:11.577
but how can I be certain?

25:11.645 --> 25:12.678
Look at your computer.

25:25.325 --> 25:27.827
How did you know
that was in the Intersect?

25:27.894 --> 25:29.662
I put it there.

25:29.730 --> 25:31.397
A long time ago.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.401
You really are Orion.

25:37.971 --> 25:39.171
Wake up, Casey.

25:39.239 --> 25:40.139
The '80s are over.

25:41.775 --> 25:43.042
I lied to Chuck earlier.

25:43.110 --> 25:44.644
He's done what no one else
could do.

25:44.711 --> 25:45.878
He found him.

25:45.946 --> 25:47.513
Chuck found Orion.

25:47.581 --> 25:49.081
General, why
lie to him?

25:49.149 --> 25:51.984
Orion is extremely important
to this project and to Chuck.

25:52.052 --> 25:53.386
Important?

25:53.453 --> 25:55.521
Don't think for a second
that you can tell me

25:55.589 --> 25:56.922
what is important, Agent Walker.

25:56.990 --> 25:58.958
I've had an army of
analysts and spies

25:59.026 --> 26:01.560
hunting for Orion since before
you were in a training bra.

26:03.997 --> 26:05.631
After the first Cipher
was completed,

26:05.699 --> 26:08.134
Orion purged his personal
records and disappeared.

26:08.201 --> 26:09.902
We've been looking for him
ever since.

26:09.970 --> 26:11.137
So has FULCRUM.

26:11.204 --> 26:12.471
Neither of us
has been able

26:12.539 --> 26:14.206
to lay a hand
on him.

26:14.274 --> 26:15.675
Until now.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.576
Until Bartowski.

26:19.980 --> 26:21.080
You need to go.

26:21.148 --> 26:22.481
No, look, I have to tell Sarah

26:22.549 --> 26:23.683
and Casey what you just did.

26:23.750 --> 26:24.717
It's proof that you're Orion.

26:24.785 --> 26:26.118
And, on another note,

26:26.186 --> 26:28.554
I've got a small convention
of agents gathered

26:28.622 --> 26:30.723
in my courtyard, and my team
is in a high-level meeting.

26:30.791 --> 26:31.824
You can't trust them.

26:31.892 --> 26:33.059
Who, Sarah and Casey?

26:33.126 --> 26:34.627
They save my life
on a regular basis.

26:34.695 --> 26:36.595
Go to your computer.

26:41.902 --> 26:43.202
So, we're dealing
with the real Orion.

26:43.270 --> 26:44.870
How dangerous is he?

26:44.938 --> 26:46.505
When FULCRUM made a
move on him in Hong Kong,

26:46.573 --> 26:48.107
he nearly destroyed
an entire building

26:48.175 --> 26:49.408
with a stolen
Predator.

26:49.476 --> 26:50.409
Wow.

26:50.477 --> 26:51.711
Beckman is tiny.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.512
General, what if Orion
can help Chuck

26:53.580 --> 26:55.915
remove the Intersect,
erase it from his mind?

26:55.982 --> 26:57.016
Yeah, yeah.

26:57.084 --> 26:58.584
Good question, Sarah.

26:58.652 --> 27:00.252
That's exactly
what I don't want.

27:00.320 --> 27:02.054
Chuck Bartowski
is absolutely vital

27:02.122 --> 27:03.289
to national security.

27:03.357 --> 27:06.425
He can never
meet Orion.

27:06.493 --> 27:08.361
Do you understand that,
Agent Walker?

27:09.863 --> 27:12.765
Uh... yes.

27:12.833 --> 27:14.834
What?

27:14.901 --> 27:16.469
Sarah, no.

27:17.671 --> 27:19.372
Yes, I understand.

27:21.408 --> 27:23.376
You have 40 seconds to exit.

27:23.443 --> 27:24.777
Their surveillance is down.

27:24.845 --> 27:26.245
What about the agents?

27:28.148 --> 27:29.648
Leave the watch.

27:29.716 --> 27:31.650
Go now.

28:11.992 --> 28:12.858
What's happening?

28:17.197 --> 28:19.098
Uh... that's good.

28:19.166 --> 28:20.266
Who did you think I was?

28:21.701 --> 28:23.202
I'm sorry, I had to make certain

28:23.270 --> 28:24.403
this wasn't a trap.

28:24.471 --> 28:25.671
Orion.

28:25.739 --> 28:27.039
Hello, Chuck.

28:27.107 --> 28:29.475
It's good to finally see you
face-to-face.

28:29.543 --> 28:30.476
Yeah.

28:30.544 --> 28:31.444
Yeah, same here.

28:37.451 --> 28:39.885
Can I... can I ask you
a question?

28:39.953 --> 28:41.320
Of course.

28:41.388 --> 28:43.522
The Intersect
that's in my head right now...

28:43.590 --> 28:44.824
You want to get it out,
don't you?

28:44.891 --> 28:46.492
Yes, yes, I very much do.

28:51.364 --> 28:52.698
We need to meet first.

28:52.766 --> 28:53.833
Okay, yeah, yeah.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.034
My calendar is pretty wide open.

28:55.101 --> 28:56.836
When can we meet tonight?

28:56.903 --> 28:57.870
Tonight?

28:57.938 --> 28:59.104
I'm in Los Angeles.

28:59.172 --> 29:00.840
We have much to discuss--
meet me here

29:00.907 --> 29:02.441
in an hour.

29:02.509 --> 29:04.543
Orion out.

29:04.611 --> 29:05.911
Okay.

29:05.979 --> 29:07.413
Chuck out.

29:09.316 --> 29:10.416
Don't scream.

29:10.484 --> 29:12.151
I have a splitting
headache.

29:13.954 --> 29:15.754
Oh, oh, oh.

29:15.789 --> 29:17.690
You're... you're
not dead.

29:23.129 --> 29:24.897
A modified poison

29:24.964 --> 29:26.398
extracted from blowfish.

29:26.466 --> 29:29.902
FULCRUM agents are taught
to survive its near-death state.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.004
That sounds like a fun class.

29:32.071 --> 29:34.072
Not really.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.607
Now...

29:35.675 --> 29:38.877
I need you to do
exactly as I say.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.078
Stand up.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.513
Stand up... I'm standing.

29:44.851 --> 29:47.019
Oh, oh, oh!

29:47.086 --> 29:48.053
Sorry, sorry.

29:48.121 --> 29:49.121
Let's go.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.291
I don't care what
Bartowski thinks he wants.

29:52.358 --> 29:54.526
I want Orion.
- General.

29:54.594 --> 29:56.261
What is it, Walker?

29:56.329 --> 29:57.729
I need to say something.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.933
Chuck Bartowski has
risked his life

30:01.000 --> 30:02.534
for this country.

30:02.602 --> 30:05.337
But he's not a spy,
and he knows it.

30:05.405 --> 30:07.372
He's a spy until I say he isn't.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.308
General, Chuck knows
that Orion is out there,

30:09.375 --> 30:12.611
and he is not going to just sit
in his room and do what we say.

30:12.679 --> 30:13.679
He...

30:14.948 --> 30:16.915
What is it?
Where is Chuck?

30:23.156 --> 30:24.823
The watch has
him in his room.

30:24.891 --> 30:26.258
No, this is Chuck
we're talking about.

30:26.326 --> 30:28.227
He would have come up
with some excuse to come in here

30:28.294 --> 30:29.628
and meet the general in person.
- What?

30:29.696 --> 30:30.929
Check his room.
- Walker's right.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.164
Chuck's a social butterfly
by nature.

30:33.533 --> 30:35.267
Checking the Castle.

30:44.477 --> 30:45.711
No, wait, wait, wait,
run the tape back.

30:45.778 --> 30:46.645
There's got
to be something else.

31:16.543 --> 31:18.010
Okay.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.345
I shut off the security cameras.

31:20.413 --> 31:22.180
We're clear.

31:22.248 --> 31:23.882
My God.

31:23.950 --> 31:25.217
It's beautiful.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.625
Oh, it's so clean

31:33.693 --> 31:35.360
and fresh, like...

31:36.596 --> 31:38.263
Douches.
Oh, my God.

31:38.331 --> 31:39.264
Oh, hey.

31:39.332 --> 31:40.566
You know what we'll do?

31:40.633 --> 31:41.934
We'll draw little
funny faces on them.

31:42.001 --> 31:43.702
How about that?
- Nope.

31:43.770 --> 31:45.270
What's that?
- My fiddle.

31:45.338 --> 31:47.105
We're going to play music?

31:47.173 --> 31:49.441
Oh, yeah.
- No, no, hold on a second.

31:49.509 --> 31:51.276
Wait, wait, wait...
uh, stand by here, everybody.

31:51.344 --> 31:52.644
Can I have a moment
of your time?

31:52.712 --> 31:53.912
If we could
just, uh,

31:53.980 --> 31:55.480
talk about
what's about to happen here,

31:55.548 --> 31:57.482
okay, and see what emotions
start bubbling up,

31:57.550 --> 31:58.784
and... talk.

31:58.851 --> 31:59.885
You and I
will talk.

31:59.953 --> 32:01.286
We'll just
talk it out.

32:03.056 --> 32:04.456
This isn't you, sir.

32:04.524 --> 32:06.258
They hit one
of my men.

32:06.326 --> 32:08.427
Then, let Emmett
have the bat, all right?

32:08.494 --> 32:10.162
Let him take his revenge
out on the store.

32:10.229 --> 32:11.430
That... that sounds
vaguely sane.

32:12.599 --> 32:13.699
Here.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.233
I can be destructive.

32:18.938 --> 32:19.905
Oh.

32:19.973 --> 32:22.274
All right! So...

32:22.342 --> 32:25.110
What to hit first?

32:25.178 --> 32:27.179
Ah!

32:27.246 --> 32:28.614
How about that?

32:31.718 --> 32:33.552
All right, one
more time.

32:33.620 --> 32:35.487
With feeling.

32:50.870 --> 32:52.604
Oh, God.

32:54.474 --> 32:57.909
Okay, team...

32:57.977 --> 32:59.411
We should run now.

33:02.482 --> 33:03.649
<i>Viva la</i> Buy More!

33:03.716 --> 33:05.851
Burbank style!

33:10.790 --> 33:12.624
How long have you
known Orion?

33:13.826 --> 33:15.394
I don't really know him.

33:15.461 --> 33:16.895
You're CIA, right?

33:16.963 --> 33:19.498
Sure.

33:19.565 --> 33:20.999
Name's Carmichael.

33:21.067 --> 33:22.434
I've heard of you.

33:22.502 --> 33:25.504
Orion was coming out
of the cold for you.

33:25.571 --> 33:27.105
That's excellent work.

33:27.173 --> 33:29.975
I've been after him
for three years.

33:30.043 --> 33:31.376
What's your secret?

33:33.146 --> 33:34.413
Someone's
approaching from the east.

33:34.480 --> 33:37.582
I need you to stand
by the window

33:37.650 --> 33:39.451
so Orion can see you.

33:57.470 --> 33:59.705
Tell him it's safe.

34:00.873 --> 34:04.009
Tell him it's safe.

34:15.722 --> 34:16.822
Yeah, it's safe.

34:28.101 --> 34:29.400
Take him!

34:41.714 --> 34:43.581
Take him to the roof.
Chopper's on the way.

34:49.222 --> 34:52.224
On behalf of FULCRUM,

34:52.291 --> 34:54.693
I'd like to thank you,
Agent Carmichael.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.702
I wish I could give
you a proper reward.

35:05.571 --> 35:08.073
But, fortunately,
I have to shoot you.

35:08.141 --> 35:10.909
It would be
unprofessional not to.

35:16.516 --> 35:18.216
Chopper is here.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.285
Move out now. Now!

35:24.891 --> 35:26.458
No, no, they have Orion!

35:26.526 --> 35:27.926
They're gonna take him
to the roof!

35:27.994 --> 35:29.561
No, we're not...
- I can save him!

35:29.629 --> 35:30.495
Chuck!

35:37.503 --> 35:39.971
No!

35:47.513 --> 35:49.381
What does that mean?

35:49.448 --> 35:50.115
I don't know.

35:53.286 --> 35:56.188
Yes, General, I read you.

35:56.255 --> 35:57.556
We have to get
outta here.

35:57.623 --> 35:58.824
A Predator's heading toward us.

36:00.860 --> 36:01.993
He's trying to take himself out.

36:02.061 --> 36:02.727
Chuck, we have to go now.

36:02.795 --> 36:04.262
No, no, I can do this.

36:04.330 --> 36:05.163
I can reprogram the Predator.

36:11.204 --> 36:12.037
Come on!

36:15.074 --> 36:16.107
We are leaving, Chuck.

36:16.175 --> 36:17.075
No! No, no, no,
I have to do this.

36:17.143 --> 36:18.143
He can't die!

36:18.211 --> 36:19.244
Chuck,
you can't save him.

36:19.312 --> 36:21.279
Okay, you can't fix this one.

36:40.695 --> 36:42.896
It's better that Orion didn't
fall into FULCRUM's hands.

36:42.964 --> 36:44.531
He knew what they
would do to him.

36:44.599 --> 36:46.400
He knew what they would gain.

36:48.570 --> 36:50.003
General, you don't
want the Intersect

36:50.071 --> 36:51.271
out of my head, do you?

36:51.339 --> 36:53.407
No, I don't.

36:55.343 --> 36:57.811
Ma'am, Chuck has done everything
that we've asked of him.

36:57.879 --> 37:00.280
Agent Walker,
you want to protect him.

37:00.348 --> 37:01.548
But playtime is over.

37:01.616 --> 37:03.817
Chuck, I hesitate to say this.

37:03.885 --> 37:06.186
Please, please, hesitate.

37:06.254 --> 37:09.156
We are in the midst
of a secret war with FULCRUM.

37:09.224 --> 37:11.391
And I believe the
outcome of this fight

37:11.459 --> 37:13.927
will rest squarely
on your shoulders.

37:13.995 --> 37:15.562
Oy.

37:15.630 --> 37:16.630
No, listen to the man.

37:16.698 --> 37:17.898
He's right.

37:17.966 --> 37:18.899
I'm no spy.

37:18.967 --> 37:20.134
Do you know how many agents

37:20.201 --> 37:21.235
I've lost to FULCRUM?

37:21.302 --> 37:22.903
How powerful they are?

37:22.971 --> 37:24.905
Only this operation,

37:24.973 --> 37:27.207
only <i>you</i> have found
a hole in their armor.

37:27.275 --> 37:29.576
See, I can't lose you, Chuck.

37:29.644 --> 37:31.411
I need you.

37:31.479 --> 37:34.014
It's time for you
to become a spy.

37:36.851 --> 37:37.951
Yes!
- Yes!

37:40.255 --> 37:43.323
Love the smell of Burbank
in the morning!

37:43.391 --> 37:45.626
Smells like victory!

37:45.693 --> 37:46.793
Hey!

37:46.861 --> 37:47.995
We know what you did.

37:50.365 --> 37:51.899
Well, do you now?

37:51.966 --> 37:53.267
You went too
far, Michael.

37:53.334 --> 37:54.401
I'm calling the cops.

37:54.469 --> 37:55.569
No, you won't.

37:55.637 --> 37:57.504
It ain't the Buy More way.

37:57.572 --> 37:58.772
What?

37:58.840 --> 37:59.940
You know the rules.

38:00.008 --> 38:02.442
They cut their prices by 10%,

38:02.510 --> 38:03.844
we cut ours 15.

38:03.912 --> 38:07.381
They give away toasters,
we give away microwaves.

38:07.448 --> 38:09.550
They put their hands
on one of ours,

38:09.617 --> 38:12.152
we find their
assistant manager and...

38:14.522 --> 38:15.589
You get the picture, don't you?

38:22.397 --> 38:23.497
We're leaving.

38:23.565 --> 38:26.567
But speaking for my store

38:26.634 --> 38:29.102
and the city of
Beverly Hills as a whole,

38:29.170 --> 38:31.638
we do not approve
of your methods.

38:31.706 --> 38:32.906
Well, you're not
from Burbank.

38:38.313 --> 38:40.514
Hah!

38:41.749 --> 38:44.618
Thanks for stopping me
back there.

38:44.686 --> 38:46.753
The store doesn't need any more
trouble than it's already got.

38:46.821 --> 38:48.922
What is it, sir?

38:48.990 --> 38:51.325
Rumors mostly.

38:51.392 --> 38:55.195
There's been some talk about
a store in the area closing.

38:55.263 --> 38:57.364
People being fired--
Times are tough.

38:57.432 --> 38:59.933
Sure, yeah.

39:00.001 --> 39:02.569
We can't let that happen.

39:02.637 --> 39:05.205
Don't worry, son.

39:05.273 --> 39:06.773
We won't.

39:39.407 --> 39:40.841
If you're watching this, Chuck,

39:40.908 --> 39:42.242
it means something
happened to me.

39:42.310 --> 39:44.711
Probably something not so nice.

39:44.779 --> 39:46.580
Well, I hope we were able
to meet,

39:46.648 --> 39:48.949
I hope I was able
to tell you my real name.

39:49.017 --> 39:51.218
The cards you're looking at
are the schematics

39:51.286 --> 39:52.452
for the new Intersect.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.021
I stole them from FULCRUM.

39:54.088 --> 39:57.391
Show them to no one,
but study them.

39:57.458 --> 39:59.293
You will need to
understand that computer

39:59.360 --> 40:01.228
if you want to get the
Intersect out of your head.

40:01.296 --> 40:03.664
And yes, it's possible.

40:03.731 --> 40:05.732
If you can find
FULCRUM's Intersect,

40:05.800 --> 40:08.335
if you can get inside,

40:08.403 --> 40:10.037
you could get
your old life back.

40:10.104 --> 40:11.938
Good-bye, Chuck.

40:12.006 --> 40:14.041
This disk will self destruct

40:14.108 --> 40:16.510
in five seconds.

40:16.577 --> 40:18.645
Always wanted to say that.

40:25.687 --> 40:27.654
Chuck? Hi.

40:28.723 --> 40:30.324
She's wrong, you know.

40:30.391 --> 40:31.858
I'm not a spy.

40:33.528 --> 40:35.862
Look, Beckman is a soldier

40:35.930 --> 40:37.698
and she see things
in black and white.

40:37.765 --> 40:40.300
But she is right
about one thing.

40:40.368 --> 40:43.203
We're in the middle
of a fight with FULCRUM.

40:43.271 --> 40:45.205
Yeah, uh...

40:45.273 --> 40:48.308
I get that, I do.

40:48.376 --> 40:50.410
But this is not my future.

40:50.478 --> 40:53.246
This is what I'm
doing right now.

40:53.314 --> 40:55.682
But I will get my life back.

40:55.750 --> 40:57.584
Yeah, of course you will, Chuck.

41:00.288 --> 41:02.089
We're still a good team, right?

41:02.156 --> 41:04.257
You still trust us?

41:04.325 --> 41:06.827
I trust you.

41:06.894 --> 41:08.261
Of course I do.

41:08.329 --> 41:10.297
I'm on your side, Chuck.

41:10.365 --> 41:12.766
I know.

41:15.036 --> 41:17.170
Well, I-I better go.

41:17.238 --> 41:19.306
Yeah.

41:19.374 --> 41:22.042
Yeah, I'm, uh,
I'm a little beat.

41:22.110 --> 41:23.643
Okay.

41:27.582 --> 41:29.883
Is Walker on board
with this mission, Major Casey?

41:29.951 --> 41:31.985
Yes, ma'am, 100%.

41:32.053 --> 41:34.287
You have no reservations
about how she feels toward

41:34.355 --> 41:36.223
the asset?
- No, ma'am.

41:36.290 --> 41:38.992
I want everything you have
on her and Bartowski.

41:39.060 --> 41:41.027
Video surveillance

41:41.095 --> 41:42.596
and your unedited report.

41:42.663 --> 41:43.930
Don't you trust me?

41:43.998 --> 41:45.565
I don't trust anybody.
