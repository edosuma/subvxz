WEBVTT

00:07.574 --> 00:11.144
A HELL SPAWN IS RETURNED
TO EARTH SOUL-LESS,

00:11.211 --> 00:13.546
HIS MIND RAVAGED,

00:13.613 --> 00:16.449
HIS MEMORY,
SHATTERED.

00:16.516 --> 00:19.185
THEY TOOK
EVERYTHING FROM ME !

00:19.252 --> 00:21.321
TERRY, DON'T LEAVE ME
THE WAY HE DID.

00:21.388 --> 00:23.423
PROMISE ME,
NO FIELD ASSIGNMENTS.

00:23.490 --> 00:26.393
I THINK I FOUND SOMETHING
THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO FIND.

00:26.459 --> 00:29.095
ONE OF MY OWN.

00:29.162 --> 00:32.832
WHY DON'T WE HAVE FITZGERALD
SHAKE HANDS WITH MR. RIMERE ?

00:32.899 --> 00:34.734
THEY'RE SUCH
OLD FRIENDS.

00:34.801 --> 00:36.936
YOU HAVE A WIFE
AND A CHILD.

00:37.003 --> 00:38.505
LET SOMEONE ELSE
TAKE CARE OF IT.

00:38.571 --> 00:39.806
I'M ALL ALONE
ON THIS.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.641
FITZGERALD
IS A TRAITOR,

00:41.708 --> 00:43.877
AND HOW DOES OUR AGENCY
HANDLE TRAITORS ?

00:43.943 --> 00:46.579
SELLING ARMS
TO A TERRORIST,

00:46.646 --> 00:49.249
THAT WAS AN IMPROPER THING
TO DO, MR. FITZGERALD.

00:49.315 --> 00:50.683
THIS IS BULLSHIT !

00:50.750 --> 00:55.588
HOLY SHIT,
WYNN IS A TRAITOR.

00:57.524 --> 01:00.727
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE
ON THIS ROOF.

01:00.794 --> 01:05.064
TAKE CARE OF WANDA...
UNTIL I COME FOR HER.

01:41.401 --> 01:43.169
NO !

02:08.428 --> 02:11.431
WE ALL KNOW THAT WE LIVE
IN A WORLD OF HURT.

02:11.498 --> 02:14.167
WE CAN SEE THE VIOLENCE
AND GREED ALL AROUND US.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.605
SOME RELY HEAVILY ON FATE
TO COPE WITH THAT,

02:18.671 --> 02:21.574
WHEN THE WORLD'S
BREAKING THEIR HEART.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.843
SOME RELY ON OTHER ADDICTIONS...

02:23.910 --> 02:27.580
LIKE DRUGS
AND COLD HARD CASH.

02:28.681 --> 02:31.184
BUT WHAT IF THE THINGS
THAT WE BELIEVE IN

02:31.251 --> 02:33.453
ARE THE SAME THINGS
THAT CAN DESTROY US ?

02:33.520 --> 02:37.023
GOOD, EVIL, WHAT IF
WE'RE WRONG ABOUT ALL OF I(@?

02:37.090 --> 02:38.324
SEE, AL SIMMONS,

02:38.391 --> 02:41.194
HE WENT TO HIS GRAVE BELIEVING
HE WAS A PATRIOT.

02:41.261 --> 02:43.596
HE MURDERED FOR HIS COUNTRY
AND HIS FLAG,

02:43.663 --> 02:45.331
BUT IN HIS DREAMS,

02:45.398 --> 02:47.667
HE SEES THE DEAD
THAT HE CREATED,

02:47.734 --> 02:49.802
AND HE REMEMBERS.

02:59.812 --> 03:03.049
( Cogliostro )
IN THE CITY

03:03.116 --> 03:06.819
A RIVER OF HUMANITY
RUSHES PAST,

03:06.886 --> 03:10.123
LEAVING BEHIND
IN THE ALLEYS,

03:10.189 --> 03:11.991
THE REFUSE,

03:12.058 --> 03:16.229
THOSE THAT BECOME
LOST IN THE NIGHT,

03:16.296 --> 03:19.899
THE SICK...
AND THE BROKEN.

03:19.966 --> 03:24.103
SPAWN SHARES THIS ALLEY
WITH THE LOST SOULS,

03:24.170 --> 03:25.939
WHO, LIKE HIM,

03:26.005 --> 03:31.744
LONG TO ESCAPE THEIR WOUNDED
AND TORMENTED EXISTENCE.

03:39.752 --> 03:42.889
DOES HE FEEL
ANYTHING AT ALL... ?

03:46.559 --> 03:49.095
OR IS HIS HEART
DARK AND EMPTY

03:49.162 --> 03:52.799
WITH NO SHRED
OF HUMANITY LEFT ?

03:54.400 --> 03:58.304
IS THE HELL SPAWN EVEN AWARE
THAT HIS PRESENCE

03:58.371 --> 04:02.508
CAUSES THE DESTRUCTION
OF THOSE CLOSEST TO HIM... ?

04:03.843 --> 04:07.180
THOSE HE HAD
HOPED TO PROTECT ?

04:09.682 --> 04:12.318
( male )
EVERYONE'S IN PLACE,
MERRICK.

04:12.385 --> 04:14.287
( Merrick )
Wynn's still inside
with the wife.

04:14.354 --> 04:16.856
If Fitzgerald comes home,
wait until Wynn walks out,

04:16.923 --> 04:19.025
and then
kill them all.

04:21.694 --> 04:26.232
WANDA, YOU'VE CREATED
QUITE A STIR AT THE<i> NSC.</i>

04:26.299 --> 04:28.134
I DON'T LIKE GETTING
THE RUNAROUND.

04:28.201 --> 04:30.870
THIS HAS BECOME A VERY
DANGEROUS SITUATION FOR TERRY.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.172
WHO KNOWS WHAT
HE'S CAPABLE OF DOING.

04:33.239 --> 04:35.441
HE NEEDS TO TURN
HIMSELF IN, WANDA.

04:35.508 --> 04:37.076
HE'S NOT
A CRIMINAL !

04:37.143 --> 04:39.812
YOU AND I
BOTH KNOW THAT,

04:39.879 --> 04:43.116
BUT HIS BEHAVIOR,
IT'S ERRATIC.

04:43.182 --> 04:44.150
HE'S STRESSED.

04:44.217 --> 04:45.385
YOU LOVE HIM,

04:45.451 --> 04:47.420
BUT TO THE NSC
HE'S CONSIDERED A TRAITOR.

04:47.487 --> 04:50.256
THAT IS NOT TERRY.

04:50.323 --> 04:52.592
I HOPE
IT'S NOT.

04:52.659 --> 04:55.595
IF HE CALLS YOU HERE
YOU MUST TELL HIM TO CONTACT ME.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.664
I'M HIS ONLY HOPE.

04:57.730 --> 04:59.332
YOU'VE ALREADY
LOST ONE HUSBAND.

04:59.399 --> 05:02.068
IT WOULD BE A SHAME
TO LOSE ANOTHER.

05:08.441 --> 05:10.743
HEY, ARE YOU HAVING
A ROUGH ONE ?

05:10.810 --> 05:12.178
YOU SAY SOMETHING ?

05:12.245 --> 05:13.479
A ROUGH NIGHT ?

05:13.546 --> 05:14.881
YOU DON'T
WANT TO KNOW.

05:14.947 --> 05:16.616
YOU WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT ?

05:16.683 --> 05:17.684
NO, THANKS.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.018
I'M GONNA
USE THE PHONE.

05:19.085 --> 05:20.820
SORRY,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO PRY.

05:20.887 --> 05:22.221
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

05:27.026 --> 05:28.227
( phone ringing )

05:28.294 --> 05:32.031
IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING, JASON,
PLEASE CALL ME.

05:32.098 --> 05:33.199
Hello ?

05:33.266 --> 05:34.400

05:34.467 --> 05:36.002
Hello ?!

05:39.305 --> 05:41.074
HEY, GOOD LUCK !

05:54.153 --> 05:57.390

THIS FUCKING BOX ?

06:04.130 --> 06:07.233
THE THING ABOUT DONUTS,

06:07.300 --> 06:09.602
THEY'RE ALWAYS
BETTER BY THE DOZEN.

06:13.072 --> 06:16.242
( male )
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY MORE
OF YOU FUCKING BUMS.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.177
YOU SCARE
THE CUSTOMERS AWAY.

06:18.244 --> 06:19.645
WE'RE TRYING TO RUN
A BUSINESS HERE.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.347
TELL YOUR BUDDIES
THAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE

06:21.414 --> 06:23.216
A SINGLE GODDAMN BUM

06:23.282 --> 06:24.684
YOU STINK, MAN !

06:24.751 --> 06:26.419
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY
RESPECT FOR YOURSELF ?

06:26.486 --> 06:29.188
IT PERSONALLY OFFENDS ME
TO SMELL YOU !

06:29.255 --> 06:31.891
COME ON, STICKS,
LET'S GO.

PLEASE DON'T HURT ME.

06:53.212 --> 06:54.647

07:17.603 --> 07:19.338
HE NEEDS TO

07:42.595 --> 07:45.264
HE'S COMING,

07:46.966 --> 07:49.235

08:00.913 --> 08:02.248
EXCUSE ME.

08:19.765 --> 08:22.201
HAVE YOU TWO THOUGHT
ABOUT MY OFFER ?

08:23.603 --> 08:26.105
YOU'LL MAKE A LOT

COPS, WHAT A FUCKING JOKE.

09:06.946 --> 09:09.482

IT WASN'T THE COPS WHO FORCED
JOHNNY AND HIS BOYS OUT.

09:09.548 --> 09:11.884
( male )
I HEARD IT WAS SOME KIND OF
GHOST THAT SCARED HIM OFF.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.219
JOHNNY WAS CREOLE,

09:13.286 --> 09:15.554
THEY'RE ALWAYS SPOOKED
BY SHIT LIKE THAT.

WE OWN
THESE ALLEYS NOW.

09:17.356 --> 09:19.926
I WANT A STEEL DOOR,

09:45.918 --> 09:47.887
WE DON'T TAKE CHECKS.

09:47.954 --> 09:50.256
( male )
THAT'S RIGHT, MR. WALL STREET,
CASH ONLY TO BE SAVED.

10:46.445 --> 10:48.247
NO ONE
LISTENS TO ME.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.050
I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE
DON'T LISTEN TO ME.

10:59.425 --> 11:01.894
WE WON'T BE NEEDING
GUNS FOR THIS.

11:02.928 --> 11:04.663
EASY, DONNIE BOY.

11:04.730 --> 11:07.133
YOUR BROTHER JUST WANTS YOU

11:43.803 --> 11:47.306
OH, JOE,
HE USED TO SING ME SONGS.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.809
JOE WAS
NICE TO ME, HONEY.

11:49.875 --> 11:53.712
OH, GOD, WE CAME HERE
BECAUSE OF THE GUARDIAN.

11:53.779 --> 11:56.615
HE WAS GONNA
PROTECT US.

11:56.682 --> 11:59.351
I DON'T KNOW, LUCY,
MAYBE THEY'RE JUST STORIES.

11:59.418 --> 12:01.587
NO, NO,
HE'S OUR ANGEL,

12:01.654 --> 12:03.289
OUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

12:03.355 --> 12:04.557
HE'S OURS.

12:04.623 --> 12:06.859
HE KNOWS HOW WE FEEL
BECAUSE HE'S LIKE US.

12:06.926 --> 12:09.261
MAYBE JOE
DIDN'T BELIEVE.

12:09.328 --> 12:12.231
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN HIM,
ARNIE, OR HE WON'T COME.

12:12.298 --> 12:16.135
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

12:16.202 --> 12:17.336
POOR JOE.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.339
WHY DO WE HAVE TO THROW HIM
AWAY LIKE THIS ?

12:20.406 --> 12:23.676
THE WATER'S SO DIRTY

12:50.035 --> 12:52.271
NO ONE

TWO WHOLE MONTHS ?

13:08.521 --> 13:10.623
I WISH I DIDN'T
HAVE TO GO.

13:10.689 --> 13:13.425
HOW ABOUT

13:13.492 --> 13:16.195
TO REMEMBER ME BY ?

13:21.367 --> 13:23.736
WHERE WAS HE ?

13:23.802 --> 13:27.006
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT US,
PASS JUDGMENT.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.177
IT'S ME, HANK.

13:31.243 --> 13:33.779

THANKS.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.286
EASY.

13:41.587 --> 13:43.622
HE DIDN'T DO SHIT.

13:43.689 --> 13:45.991
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TOLD US ABOUT HIM.

13:46.058 --> 13:47.526
WHY ISN'T HE HERE ?

13:47.593 --> 13:49.328
IS HE SCARED TO DO ANYTHING
LIKE COPS ?

13:49.395 --> 13:50.863
WELL, MAYBE
HE'S NOT REAL.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.665
JUST MORE
OF YOUR DRUNK TALK.

13:52.731 --> 13:54.300
OH, HE'S REAL,
HANK.

13:54.366 --> 13:55.701
I'M TELLING YOU,

13:55.768 --> 13:58.204
HE'S BULLSHIT,
GAREB !
