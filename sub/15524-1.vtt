(PANTING)

01:01.812 --> 01:03.564
Sarah! Sarah!

01:03.647 --> 01:05.820
Duncan, what happened to you?

01:05.899 --> 01:08.027
Good. You're okay.
Go down to the basement.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.362
Right now.
(PANTING)

01:11.655 --> 01:13.032
Oh, my God!
What is that?

01:13.115 --> 01:14.788
Do it now! Hurry!

01:19.580 --> 01:20.581
Goddamn it!

DOCTOR: And there she blows.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.652
Mr. and Mrs. Hayslip,
take a look.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.194
What is it?

03:11.024 --> 03:13.573
It's definitely something
the doctor should look at.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.243
- He'll be with you in a moment.
- Thank you.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.040
Thanks.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.170
Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh.

03:27.249 --> 03:29.001
Familial adenomatous polypsis.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.716
It's a polyp.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.848
Oh, it sounds really bad.
That sounds bad.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.013
You got a thing in your butt.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.435
- Okay.
- Yeah.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.228
You got a little trooper
in your pooper.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.726
- You don't need him there.
- Is it serious?

03:42.806 --> 03:45.400
It's... it's not that bad.
It's not that serious.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.648
This though,
this is a weird shape.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.697
This is concerning me a little,
but not overly.

03:50.772 --> 03:54.868
Look, in the end,
this lump in your colon

03:54.943 --> 03:58.948
is most likely due to PSM
which is poor stress management.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.241
Look, how long have you had
stomach issues?

04:01.324 --> 04:04.498
- Um, for... ever.
- Mmmmm.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.830
Yeah, he's in the bathroom a lot.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.665
Not, I mean not, not a lot.
I'm in the bathroom

04:08.749 --> 04:11.218
a decent amount of time,
but not like, it's not extreme.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.341
- How often is a lot?
- Hour, hour and a half.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.172
Yeah, about 90 minutes.

04:15.255 --> 04:19.305
That's not, that's...
hugely concerning.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.432
Over the course of
the day, not...

04:21.511 --> 04:23.764
Okay, good thing is,
we can do something about this.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.815
It's an endoscopic polypectomy.

04:25.891 --> 04:29.691
Basically, we insert a camera,
into the anus.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.817
- Okay
- Right?

04:30.896 --> 04:33.570
There's an electrified
wire loop at the end of it,

04:33.648 --> 04:35.116
and we...
(MAKES POPPING NOISE)

04:35.192 --> 04:37.570
...pop it off,
like a plum off a tree.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.989
Being pulled
by an electrified wire loop.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.166
Okay. Okay, I get it.
You don't have to...

04:43.241 --> 04:44.993
You don't have to
describe it anymore.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.875
Do you have a family history
of G.I. problems?

04:47.954 --> 04:50.127
Uh, well, you know, my mom
would gladly tell you

04:50.207 --> 04:53.006
that she's, um, you know, regular
like clockwork. (PANTING)

04:53.084 --> 04:55.257
One of those.
What about your father?

04:55.337 --> 04:57.305
Uh, well, we don't speak.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.974
I haven't spoken to him
in sometime. So...

05:00.050 --> 05:02.644
Look, I think what you're going
to need is some coping mechanisms,

05:02.719 --> 05:05.097
so I can give you the name
of some professionals

05:05.180 --> 05:08.229
- that can help you out.
- Are you talking about a therapist?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.060
Oh, I'm nut...
I'm not a therapy guy.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.770
We can get there.
We'll do it. We'll call him.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.730
Great. Stop by the desk
on your way out.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.862
Talk to Nancy about
scheduling a follow-up.

05:15.941 --> 05:19.070
Until then, you take it down.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.826
- No stress. Keep it quiet.
- Right.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.998
No stress.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.164
(WHISPERING) Keep it cool.

You might be in the wrong office.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.165
Hey. Hey, guys.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.208
Just take that all
down the hall and to the left.

06:07.284 --> 06:11.881
Lucky day, Dunc. New office.
Part of the new job. What?

06:11.955 --> 06:13.332
New job?

06:13.415 --> 06:15.634
Human resources.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.838
I'm an accountant. I don't know
the first thing about humans.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.764
Come on, it's just temporary.
You're far too valuable an accountant

06:21.840 --> 06:23.012
to keep in H.R. permanently.

06:23.550 --> 06:26.099
I'd love to help. I just don't know
if I'm the right man for the job.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.770
- Do you believe in this company?
- Yes.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.314
- Believe in our mission statement?
- Yes.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.391
Our employees are also our clients.
Of course.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.523
Our clients trust us because
we put our own skin in the game.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.105
- I'm in the game.
- I'm in the game, too.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.736
Your retirement account is here.
Mine is here. We're in this together.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.488
Right. Right. Right.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.615
Which is why I need you
to handle the layoffs.

06:43.904 --> 06:44.905
What?

06:44.988 --> 06:47.241
- You're a nice guy, Dunc.
- Thank you.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.076
Which is exactly what we need
right now.

06:49.159 --> 06:52.254
A nice guy, and we gotta
let some people go,

06:52.329 --> 06:54.377
and you just said
you're a team player.

06:54.456 --> 06:57.710
I am a team player,
it's just that I don't...

06:57.792 --> 07:01.046
I don't... I've never fired
anybody before in my life.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.848
It's easy, you'll love it.
I'm so glad you're on board.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.347
Um, I'll be sad to see you go.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.061

07:08.136 --> 07:10.434
So. Your new office.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.401

07:15.477 --> 07:18.196
It was a bathroom, and now
it is an office for two.

07:18.647 --> 07:19.648
Hey, there, cubie.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.946

and uh, I'm going to need to
see that first thing next week.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.460
Next week? I still have to
deal with the Darcy accounts.

07:35.538 --> 07:38.291
I have... The board of directors
asked me to make a presentation.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.798
- I have to get that done by Monday.
- You got Alistair.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.675

- I meant no, I'm not.

I don't get it, you meant no
when you say yes?

08:31.970 --> 08:34.894
I think it was just a mistake.
I am not lactose intolerant.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.020
Okay, don't make it a big issue.

come over here.

Uh, what... what far?

09:09.632 --> 09:11.179
What you came here for.

Hypnosis. Not?

09:13.636 --> 09:16.105
Oh... No.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.058
I want to bypass
your conscious mind

09:18.141 --> 09:20.564
to access your subconscious mind.

09:20.643 --> 09:21.690
Ah...

09:21.770 --> 09:24.444
Where the real you might be.

No, I act... I actually don't know
if this is right for me.

I mean, I'm only here
because of my wife.

Uh, no offense, I'm just not...
I just don't believe in hypnosis.

how about we just pretend...

Wow. Beatrice, I feel like
I may have mislead you

The myth of our anus.

that this very same creature

01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:38.577
Hey, everybody.
How's the... How's the party?

01:15:39.618 --> 01:15:44.044
Honey, I'm so sorry I didn't
tell you about this.

01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:47.844
L-I just figured it would end
with your dad.

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:50.004
You knew?

01:15:50.337 --> 01:15:53.216
Ish. I mean, I knew
it happened to him,

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:55.301
but I-l didn't know
it happened to you.

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:58.729
- It was hereditary or anything...
- She knew.

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:01.432
I thought, you know,
the stomach issues,

01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:04.689
I don't know, honey.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:07.863
It's okay, Mom.

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:11.405
It's fine. We're gonna use
your bathroom.

01:16:11.484 --> 01:16:12.485
Okay.

01:16:13.027 --> 01:16:14.529
Probably not gonna
clean it up.

01:16:14.612 --> 01:16:15.829
Okay.

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:17.949
Oh.

01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:21.001
Okay.
It's a very long story

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:22.954
which I'm happy to tell you
all about.

01:16:23.537 --> 01:16:26.962
Um, but first,
who would like a drink?

01:16:27.792 --> 01:16:29.840
Good.
Okay, be right back.

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:34.306
Do I really have to put it
back inside you?

01:16:34.381 --> 01:16:36.133
Yeah. He's...

01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:38.094
He's part of me.

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:40.722
He's not gonna try
and hurt you?

01:16:40.805 --> 01:16:42.102
No.

01:16:42.473 --> 01:16:44.646
He's all right now.

01:16:44.725 --> 01:16:46.147
Okay.

Okay.

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:06.798
How is this gonna work?
I mean how-how is he gonna fit?

01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:10.092
Oh, it'll...
It'll work, trust me.

01:17:12.336 --> 01:17:13.508
There you go.

(MILO MUTTERING)

01:17:17.258 --> 01:17:19.807
Are you like turning him?

01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:22.229
I... He's kind of
turning on his own.

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:27.435
Okay, that's his thing.
He's probably mad.

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:30.021
I just gotta get him
that last half inch...

01:17:30.437 --> 01:17:33.065
...in there.
- BOTH: One, two and three.

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:35.197
I'll loosen up.
(GROANS)

01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:37.278
Yep. That's it. He's up.

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:40.122
He's up there.
Okay.

01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:45.370
(SIGHS) Thanks.

01:17:54.628 --> 01:17:56.471

- Good, good.

Dunkie.
Having some belly troubles?

01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:58.562
Are you talking baby talk to me?

01:20:58.645 --> 01:21:00.488
These are standard
family dynamics.

01:21:00.564 --> 01:21:03.113
- What is?
- These are standard family dynamics.

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:04.739
- What is?
- The patriarch reserves the right

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:07.287
- to use baby talk.
- I can't imagine that's true.

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:09.866
Mom, is it fair to
say that, uh...

01:21:09.948 --> 01:21:12.201
We can just make a rule,
a house rule,

01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:15.538
- no baby talk at the table?
- Patriarch has veto power.

- Just one more.

Is it top or the bottom,
or they happen at the same time?

- Is it the barf and squat?
- Oh, uh, yeah.

that you were gonna suggest?

Full Thrust Sundays.

Tuna, chicken, or meat.

coming out again.

01:23:42.601 --> 01:23:46.105
Yeah. You can put a cork there.
A big one.

01:23:46.897 --> 01:23:48.695
It's gonna have to be
a pretty big cork.
