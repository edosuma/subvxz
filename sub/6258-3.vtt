00:07.840 --> 00:09.842
(yelling)

00:10.000 --> 00:13.527
( screams )

00:15.760 --> 00:17.489
Sometimes
what you think you saw

00:17.640 --> 00:19.210
is exactly what you saw.

00:19.360 --> 00:21.522
I get that you
wanna save your dad.

00:21.680 --> 00:22.886
- ( Screams )
- Ooh!

00:23.080 --> 00:24.730
( Groans )

00:24.880 --> 00:26.689
Mom, please.

00:28.480 --> 00:29.606
( Screaming )

00:29.760 --> 00:31.842
( laughs )

00:32.000 --> 00:33.764
( thunder crashes )

00:33.920 --> 00:35.081
I hate whatever did this.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.969
Kelly, if you really hate
what did this,

00:37.120 --> 00:39.202
you should come with us.

00:39.360 --> 00:40.441
We have to get that book translated

00:40.640 --> 00:44.531
and find the phrase that'll
put the lid back on all this bullshit.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.570
Yeah, hi. I came in there
many years ago.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.848
We chatted about a particular book.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.207
Can I have a look at that?

00:52.400 --> 00:54.562
Are you the one behind all this?

00:54.720 --> 00:57.724
( Music playing )

01:05.000 --> 01:07.002
( music continues )

01:47.040 --> 01:48.610
( creaking )

01:57.280 --> 02:01.171
( creaking )

02:21.680 --> 02:23.523
( gasps, grunting )

02:31.760 --> 02:35.048
(growling )

02:35.200 --> 02:36.486
Ash was here, wasn't he?

02:36.640 --> 02:40.042
( Spits ) Go to hell,
then we'll talk.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.043
I think we'll talk here.

02:45.320 --> 02:49.405
- ( Choking )
- Mm, Ash was here.

02:50.480 --> 02:55.361
- Did he have the book with him?
- Oh, questions, questions.

02:55.520 --> 02:58.364
Can't we have some quiet time?

02:58.520 --> 03:02.047
Ah! Ow!
Stop it, you annoying bitch!

03:02.240 --> 03:04.607
Ow! Fuck off!

03:04.760 --> 03:05.841
Answer me.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.562
All your time spent
searching for the book.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.610
You haven't learned a thing.
(wheezing, laughing )

03:13.760 --> 03:17.560
I've learned you can always
make things more painful.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.361
- Yeah, you like that?
- No.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.602
Please. No, no.

03:25.760 --> 03:26.886
No, no.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.044
No!

03:56.280 --> 03:58.169
Okay, now, the guy
who runs this place

03:58.320 --> 03:59.685
is kind of an odd duck,

03:59.880 --> 04:02.406
so no eye contact,
no conversations.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.244
(snaps)
Book me, Pablo.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.009
( Squawks )

04:15.600 --> 04:17.284
Are you sure that he can read it?

04:17.480 --> 04:18.527
Yeah, he said he could.

04:18.680 --> 04:21.000
But, you know,
that was years ago.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.607
First time I came here I was looking
for an authentic Viking helmet.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.604
I was banging this freaky chick
who got me way into role-playing...

04:27.760 --> 04:29.205
I don't wanna hear this.

04:29.360 --> 04:32.523
Anyway, I told him about the book,
and he freaked out.

04:32.680 --> 04:35.001
He said he can translate it.
No problemo.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.970
I'm happy that we're sending evil
back where it came from,

04:38.120 --> 04:41.283
that's for sure,
but it makes me a little sad

04:41.440 --> 04:43.090
that we're already
breaking up the team.

04:43.240 --> 04:46.961
Hey. I was toying
with a nickname for us.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.646
"The Ghost Beaters."

04:49.800 --> 04:52.087
That is so fucking bad.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.651
Yeah, buddy, I gotta tell ya

04:53.800 --> 04:55.802
that's probably the worst thing
I've ever heard.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.121
But look, it doesn't matter.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.931
At heart, me,
I'm an alone wolf.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.321
- "A lone wolf."
- Exactly.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.960
Doesn't it ever get old?

05:05.120 --> 05:08.203
Being alone?
Nobody to help you.

05:09.520 --> 05:12.842
No... of course not.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.690
All right, look,
if I get this done quick enough,

05:14.840 --> 05:16.888
we might have time
to stop for churros.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.889
Now, look, that's not
a racist thing, Pablo.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.644
That's just a great dessert.

05:20.840 --> 05:23.525
Okay. You know
I'm not Mexican, right?

05:23.680 --> 05:26.331
That's the spirit.
Sit tight and watch the wheels.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.845
Back in a jiff.

05:37.280 --> 05:38.770
(whistles )

05:40.200 --> 05:43.044
( eerie whispering )

05:46.400 --> 05:47.606
<i>'mesh.</i>

05:53.440 --> 05:56.091
( rings bell )
Hello.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.043
Anybody home?

05:59.200 --> 06:01.362
A guy with a very special book.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.488
Looking
to save the world with it.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.324
( Clanking )

06:06.760 --> 06:07.761
( footsteps )

06:08.760 --> 06:10.888
Ah, there you are.

06:11.040 --> 06:13.088
How're you doing, man?
Good to see you again.

06:13.240 --> 06:16.164
Uh, sorry. I was just, uh,

06:16.320 --> 06:19.085
tending to some-- some legal matters
beyond my control.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.768
- May I help you, sir?
- I'd rather get help from her.

06:26.640 --> 06:29.041
Thank you for your assistance,
Mr. Hawkins.

06:29.240 --> 06:30.401
I'll be in touch.

06:31.760 --> 06:32.807
(whistles )

06:43.600 --> 06:44.726
Oh, yeah.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.125
( Low groaning, whispering )

06:59.000 --> 07:02.607
Hey, it's Fisher.
I need you to send me that sketch.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.569
From the trailer park murders?

07:05.960 --> 07:08.486
Well, Boyle doesn't
have to know that I asked.

07:09.640 --> 07:12.610
Oh, my God. Lee, please,
just help a girl out.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.843
Thank you.
I'll buy you a beer.

07:20.280 --> 07:21.725
Come on.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.928
Lee, come on, come on.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.730
Come on.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.600
- It's real.
- You think?

07:35.760 --> 07:37.922
All my work,
all-- all my study--

07:38.080 --> 07:41.971
this book proves
that my life has meaning.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.281
Okay.
Well, great.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.528
Can you, uh, crack open
the undo spell?

07:46.680 --> 07:48.808
It's probably somewhere
near the back.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.566
- May I open it?
- That's why we're here, bucko.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.328
Ash: Kinda looks
like a face, doesn't it?

07:57.480 --> 07:59.323
Ever wonder why?

07:59.480 --> 08:02.643
Because it's, uh--
it's bound in human flesh.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.643
- That's right.
- Yeah.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.641
( Rattling )

08:16.280 --> 08:17.805
( tires squeal )

08:28.680 --> 08:30.682
Hey, how you feelin'?

08:32.480 --> 08:33.640
Pretty bad.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.208
Oh, but, hey, I think
I found the silver lining, though.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.046
It's you.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.490
You're like the little brother
I never had.

08:45.640 --> 08:48.371
Brother? Really?

08:48.520 --> 08:50.682
- Mm.
- Nah.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.931
Really.
That's how much I trust you.

08:55.080 --> 08:59.768
Yeah, sure, trust is great,
but, you know, maybe I'm a bad boy

08:59.920 --> 09:01.285
who can't be trusted.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.441
Right?

09:04.160 --> 09:06.208
Who-- who's that?

09:10.960 --> 09:13.440
Yo, that woman just
took a gun out of her car.

09:16.040 --> 09:17.610
Is there any world

09:17.760 --> 09:20.286
where this doesn't have
something to do with Ash?

09:24.920 --> 09:26.490
It's-- it's beautiful.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.405
Okay, let's get moving
with the whole process here.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.642
- What do you say?
- Uh, sure.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.320
Get on your knees!
Hands behind your head.

09:34.480 --> 09:35.561
I know who you are.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.683
Uh, lady, I think you're confused.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.810
Detective Fisher,
state police.

09:42.680 --> 09:44.330
Did she say she was a cop?

09:44.520 --> 09:47.683
Oh, shit.
I just knocked out a cop.

09:48.680 --> 09:49.841
It was self-defense.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.642
( Handcuffs ratchet)

09:55.800 --> 09:59.282
Okay, so, Lionel, you're gonna
be cool about this, right?

09:59.440 --> 10:01.442
You wouldn't wanna jeopardize
your life's work just 'cause

10:01.600 --> 10:03.728
there's an unconscious cop
in your store, right?

10:03.880 --> 10:06.042
- I mean, you get that.
- I do.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.486
You do?

10:07.640 --> 10:09.483
Kelly, come on, he's cool.
Let's not poke at it.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.449
Pablo, you and me
and Professor Know-it-all,

10:11.600 --> 10:13.125
we're gonna rid the earth of evil.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.408
Kelly, can you stay here and watch
our friend in case she wakes up?

10:15.560 --> 10:18.769
Oh, sure. I'll just sit here
with the police officer we tied up

10:18.920 --> 10:20.684
and rethink
my recent life choices.

10:20.840 --> 10:22.046
Thanks for understanding.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.567
Okay, so how's it coming
with the old undo button?

10:30.960 --> 10:34.203
- ( Buzzing )
- ( eerie whispering )

10:34.400 --> 10:37.483
That tends to happen
when you open the book.

10:37.640 --> 10:40.405
Do you even know
what you possess here?

10:40.560 --> 10:43.803
Well, of course.
I mean, obviously, I do,

10:43.960 --> 10:46.930
but, uh, you might
wanna share it with Pablo.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.321
This book is a gateway to hell,

10:50.480 --> 10:54.326
a way to summon forces of evil
into our earthly realm.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.847
Yep, that's exactly
what I thought.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.331
Please, continue.

10:58.480 --> 11:03.725
You see, in ancient times, there was
a group known as the "Dark Ones,"

11:03.880 --> 11:06.645
neither demon nor fully human.

11:06.800 --> 11:11.124
They created this book
as a weapon against humanity.

11:11.280 --> 11:14.602
These pages were cut
from the bodies of the damned,

11:14.760 --> 11:19.129
upon which the Dark Ones
inked their passages in human blood.

11:19.320 --> 11:22.529
Passages that contained the power
to create portals

11:22.680 --> 11:27.208
connecting our world
to the underworld, where evil resides.

11:27.360 --> 11:31.445
The Dark Ones used this book
to hold power over all mankind.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.284
So the book is
the source of evil?

11:33.440 --> 11:35.727
No, no.
No, not-- not the source.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.888
More of a-- a passageway.

11:38.040 --> 11:41.044
The book itself is harmless,

11:41.200 --> 11:44.682
unless wielded by someone
either very evil or very stupid.

11:44.840 --> 11:48.162
Okay, okay.
Let's say some cool guy,

11:48.320 --> 11:50.561
uh, reads from this book
by mistake

11:50.720 --> 11:52.563
and summons something
from way back,

11:52.720 --> 11:55.564
and now he just wants
to put it back, no harm, no foul?

11:55.720 --> 11:59.884
There-- there is something,
uh, about a reversal.

12:04.040 --> 12:05.644
It's a little difficult to decipher,

12:05.800 --> 12:10.806
but, uh...
the annulment lies

12:11.000 --> 12:12.889
in the origin of man-- no.

12:13.080 --> 12:18.689
Inside. Inside the origin
of the man.

12:18.880 --> 12:23.249
Annulment.
So the undo button is inside me?

12:23.400 --> 12:25.448
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

12:25.600 --> 12:29.241
Well, uh, I'm dealing with
a defunct ancient language here.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.926
Sounds like a lot of yappenin'
and not a lot of happenin'.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.650
I wish we could just
summon an answer.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.768
( Chuckling )

12:35.920 --> 12:37.604
Wait a minute,
Pablo,

12:37.760 --> 12:39.603
you smooth,
brown Einstein, that's it.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.171
We summon something
from the book

12:41.360 --> 12:42.885
that can tell us
how to undo all this.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.042
Uh, yeah, no.
That's not what I was saying.

12:45.240 --> 12:47.720
Lionel, find me
the weakest demon in that book.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.883
What the fuck?

12:53.080 --> 12:56.562
Get me out of these
fucking handcuffs right now!

12:56.720 --> 12:58.563
Sorry, not happening.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.370
I'm a fucking cop.

13:02.160 --> 13:05.289
Okay, um, put the gun down.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.727
You don't understand
what kind of trouble you're in.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.325
- I don't care.
- You will.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.562
You don't wanna be
on the wrong side of this thing.

13:11.720 --> 13:13.131
Whatever's going down here,

13:13.280 --> 13:15.009
I am already
on the wrong side of it,

13:15.160 --> 13:17.003
so no turning back now.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.128
That guy that you're with,

13:19.280 --> 13:22.204
I have reason to believe
that he's behind a lot of bad things.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.323
You're wrong.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.324
Oh, really? I'm wrong?

13:28.840 --> 13:31.241
Well, then, ask yourself--

13:31.400 --> 13:32.640
what do you really
know about him?

13:46.400 --> 13:48.368
Pablo:
So why are you doing this?

13:48.520 --> 13:50.249
I'm creating a space
for the summoning,

13:50.400 --> 13:52.209
a connection
between our world and theirs.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.601
Please, hand me the incense.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.842
Ah!

13:57.000 --> 14:00.402
Watch the circle. Okay.

14:01.720 --> 14:05.805
( Speaking foreign language )

14:09.120 --> 14:10.963
Guys, this is bad.

14:11.160 --> 14:14.403
No. No,
it's-- it's perfectly safe.

14:14.560 --> 14:18.201
Just don't break the circle
and the demon remains contained.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.681
Um, but reading
from the book

14:20.880 --> 14:23.247
is what caused all this trouble
to begin with, so--

14:23.400 --> 14:24.686
Yeah, that's true.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.360
But reading from it again
can't make things any worse.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.126
It's kind of like spilling paint
on a painting.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.248
It's okay 'cause there's
already paint on it.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.810
That is incorrect.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.041
Look, you heard
what the guy said--

14:36.200 --> 14:38.328
the demon stays in the circle,
there's no danger.

14:38.520 --> 14:42.809
Okay. Hey, will you tell him
that we shouldn't be doing this?

14:42.960 --> 14:46.885
I've been waiting my entire life
to commune with the darkness.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.371
See?
He loves it.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.249
Look, Pablo,
we're just gonna summon

14:50.400 --> 14:52.289
a teeny-tiny demon,
like a mouse demon.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.681
Let's get Kelly in here
so we can take a team vote on it.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.286
Listen to me.
Every time I've faced evil,

14:57.440 --> 14:58.441
it had the jump on me.

14:58.600 --> 15:01.251
Now we know exactly where it is,
and I'm ready.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.970
We call the shots in here.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.485
Now, come on, Pablo,

15:05.640 --> 15:07.961
you wanna be
a Ghost Beater or not?

15:09.800 --> 15:11.040
<i>- Okay -
- Okay -</i>

15:11.200 --> 15:12.281
- I'm in.
- You're in.

15:12.440 --> 15:13.885
Yeah.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.963
Lionel, you find
a wimpy demon yet?

15:17.120 --> 15:19.771
Uh, nothing that says wimpy,
specifically,

15:19.920 --> 15:23.322
but I have found a minor demon
named "Eligos,"

15:23.520 --> 15:25.249
possesses knowledge
of hidden things,

15:25.440 --> 15:27.124
a demon of the mindscape.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.163
Well, perfect.
Sounds like a total nerd.

15:29.360 --> 15:33.285
It says he preys on
the spiritually and emotionally weak.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.442
Well, he can do that
on his own time.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.171
Okay, get him out.
Let's chat.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.891
( Speaking foreign language )

15:48.040 --> 15:49.451
( eerie whispering )

15:49.600 --> 15:53.969
( foreign language continues )

16:07.480 --> 16:08.970
Listen to me.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.964
Everywhere your friend goes,
people get killed.

16:12.120 --> 16:15.044
I told you
to stop talking to me.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.480
Now, shut the fuck up.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.130
Would you be committing a felony

16:18.280 --> 16:19.930
in a creepy-ass bookstore
if it weren't for him?

16:20.120 --> 16:22.726
I'd be dead if it
weren't for him! Okay?

16:22.880 --> 16:25.690
Do you even know
what we're dealing with here?

16:25.840 --> 16:28.411
People turning into
fucking monsters.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.925
I know.

16:30.080 --> 16:33.050
I had the same partner
for 10 years.

16:34.080 --> 16:38.688
A few days ago,
I put a bullet in his head.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.922
Same thing happened to, uh--

16:44.640 --> 16:46.768
to someone close
to me, too, okay?

16:46.920 --> 16:49.605
But the guy that
you're trying to pin it on

16:49.760 --> 16:52.650
could've left me alone
to die with her, and he didn't.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.371
Listen, if you guys
are fighting these things,

16:55.520 --> 16:57.488
then we're on the same side.

17:00.520 --> 17:05.162
( Speaking foreign language )

17:10.560 --> 17:13.962
(glass clinking, rattling)

17:14.119 --> 17:17.249
( speaking foreign language )

17:17.400 --> 17:18.401
- ( glass shatters )
- ( both gasp )

17:19.839 --> 17:21.365
( both gasp)

17:21.560 --> 17:23.881
( continues speaking
foreign language )

17:28.760 --> 17:33.448
( speaking foreign language )

17:46.080 --> 17:48.367
(thunder rumbling )

17:48.520 --> 17:49.806
What the hell's
going on out there?

17:50.000 --> 17:51.843
I have no idea.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.446
I thought they
were supposed to be fixing it.

17:55.440 --> 17:56.851
It doesn't look like fixing.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.806
( Both yell )

17:59.960 --> 18:03.328
( speaking foreign language )

18:06.080 --> 18:08.890
- Is this normal?
- I have no idea.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.930
( Foreign language continues )

18:19.680 --> 18:22.331
- ( squeals )
- Oh, shit!

18:24.440 --> 18:26.807
- Oh, shit!
- ( squealing)

18:27.000 --> 18:28.331
Get away!

18:43.120 --> 18:45.248
( Screams )

18:45.400 --> 18:48.131
Look, I can help your friends,

18:48.280 --> 18:49.645
but not if I'm linked up like this.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.928
- Let me go.
- I can't.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.242
I promise you I won't hurt them.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.841
They're in trouble.
Please.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.128
( Low whispering )

19:08.360 --> 19:13.241
( continues speaking
foreign language )

19:14.240 --> 19:15.890
- ( screams )
- Oh, God!

19:21.600 --> 19:24.001
(whispering continues )

19:27.720 --> 19:31.008
( Eligos whispering )

19:37.720 --> 19:38.721
( roaring )

19:38.880 --> 19:40.609
Oh, shit!

19:41.680 --> 19:43.170
Ta shinaar.

19:43.320 --> 19:44.970
- ( Growling )
- My God.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.640
Don't break the circle!

19:47.800 --> 19:50.531
Whatever you do,
do not break the circle!

19:51.600 --> 19:55.161
Why have you
summoned me, Ashley?

19:55.320 --> 19:57.891
Okay, uh, first off...

19:58.040 --> 19:59.690
you don't look anything
like your photo,

19:59.880 --> 20:02.247
so you might
want to update that.

20:02.400 --> 20:06.724
Uh, secondly, I gotta take
whatever I summoned

20:06.880 --> 20:08.689
and put it
back into the bottle,

20:08.840 --> 20:10.968
so how do I do that?

20:11.120 --> 20:14.090
Release me and I'll tell you.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.561
Yeah.
Nice try, asshole.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.882
Give me some info I can use.

20:19.040 --> 20:23.011
Die quickly.
This is my only advice.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.170
Okay, that was a really bad idea
summoning this guy, Pablo.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.891
All right, talk now.
Last chance.

20:29.880 --> 20:33.168
(growling )

20:39.560 --> 20:43.087
Hey, Lionel, send this
know-nothing waste of time

20:43.240 --> 20:44.401
back where it came from.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.164
Right.

20:46.320 --> 20:47.321
(gunshot)

20:47.480 --> 20:49.050
Nobody move!

20:49.200 --> 20:51.043
And what the fuck
is that thing?

20:51.200 --> 20:54.283
Come on, lady, you ruined my day
twice already with this bullshit.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.767
Put the weapon down
or I will shoot you.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.002
Well, as you can see,
we're just a little busy here.

20:59.160 --> 21:00.366
NQW!

21:03.280 --> 21:04.281
No.

21:06.840 --> 21:07.921
Oh, shit.

21:12.720 --> 21:15.485
( Screams )
Lionel, send it back!

21:17.040 --> 21:18.246
No!

21:19.760 --> 21:21.603
( Lionel chanting )

21:21.800 --> 21:24.371
( screaming )

21:35.720 --> 21:37.768
Hey. egg head!

21:39.680 --> 21:40.886
(gunshot)

21:44.840 --> 21:46.171
What the fuck?

21:46.360 --> 21:48.169
( Groans )

21:49.680 --> 21:51.489
( Eligos growling )

21:55.400 --> 21:56.401
Kelly, come here.

21:56.560 --> 21:57.721
Stay down!

22:01.000 --> 22:04.209
What's going on?
What is that thing?

22:04.360 --> 22:06.124
Ash summoned a demon.

22:06.280 --> 22:07.645
He did what?

22:07.840 --> 22:09.842
( Speaking foreign language )

22:10.000 --> 22:11.126
(gunshot)

22:11.280 --> 22:14.170
- Lionel, hurry up!
- I am trying!

22:29.960 --> 22:31.405
No!

22:38.640 --> 22:40.688
- Fuck!
- We have to do something!

22:40.840 --> 22:42.171
We have to get to that book.

22:42.320 --> 22:45.881
That won't help!
No one else can read it!

22:52.160 --> 22:54.925
Hey, what--
what are you doing?

22:55.080 --> 22:56.730
( Screaming )

22:56.880 --> 22:58.769
Helpil19-

23:02.960 --> 23:06.567
- Nice shooting, Tex-Mex.
- Anytime, jefe.

23:21.320 --> 23:24.529
Humanity's time
is at an end.

23:24.680 --> 23:26.648
- ( Heartbeat pumping )
- Go back to hell!

23:26.840 --> 23:28.524
(grunts)

23:42.080 --> 23:43.241
( groans )

23:46.640 --> 23:48.802
Well, that sucked pretty hard.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.166
You guys Okay?

23:52.720 --> 23:55.326
Yeah, I'm good.

23:55.480 --> 23:56.641
Yeah, I think so.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.929
All right, grab the book
and get to the Delta.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.244
Maybe now you'll
let me explain myself

24:05.400 --> 24:07.641
instead of pointing
your gun at me.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.961
Okay, here's my story--

24:16.680 --> 24:18.364
Ah, come on.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.044
What?

24:25.880 --> 24:28.121
Well, that demon thing
did not fight fair.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.049
It was like he was in my head.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.123
Um, what did you do
with the cop?

24:32.320 --> 24:35.324
- Wait, did you kill her?
- No, Jesus. I cuffed her to a table.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.130
I lost my pal Woody in the process,

24:37.280 --> 24:39.886
but, hey, if you want to
let her out again, knock yourself out.

24:40.080 --> 24:43.289
She fucking lied to me, all right?
She said she would help.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.444
Well, then, you two learned
a very important lesson today.

24:46.600 --> 24:50.286
Cops don't help.
We should go before more show up.

24:54.480 --> 24:58.121
Honestly, I don't think
you should be giving me shit right now.

24:58.280 --> 24:59.725
Why would you
summon that thing anyway?

24:59.880 --> 25:03.089
So that we can learn
how to unsummon everything else.

25:03.240 --> 25:06.369
Come on, Kelly, keep up.
Although we're kinda boned there, too.

25:06.560 --> 25:07.925
The only useful thing
I learned in there

25:08.080 --> 25:11.880
was that the answer might be...
inside me?

25:12.040 --> 25:13.166
Whatever the hell that means.

25:13.360 --> 25:14.691
Look inside yourself
for the answer?

25:14.840 --> 25:17.923
Oh, sure, now that I gave you
all the clues, it's obvious.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.320
Easier said than done, sister.

25:19.480 --> 25:22.131
I think I know someone
who can help us.

25:22.280 --> 25:25.409
My uncle, he's a "brujo,"
a shaman.

25:25.560 --> 25:28.040
Wait, you're related
to a witch doctor?

25:28.200 --> 25:29.531
Kinda, yeah.

25:29.680 --> 25:32.604
Um, but I haven't talked to him
in a really long time.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.041
I do not think Brujo
would be happy to see me.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.123
I'll just take him
a couple of Miller Tall Boys--

25:37.280 --> 25:39.760
boom, problem solved.

25:39.920 --> 25:43.766
Pablo, come on, this is bigger
than your uncle issues.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.160
Okay, all right.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.084
All right, point the way.
We gotta vémanos.

25:47.240 --> 25:50.608
We? I thought you
were an alone wolf.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.883
Not anymore.

25:54.040 --> 25:56.486
I wouldn't be alive right now
if it wasn't for my pack.

25:57.840 --> 25:59.888
I think we should
run together for a while.
