'Previously on St Elsewhere...'

00:05.840 --> 00:07.440
We'll find another housekeeper.

00:07.440 --> 00:11.440
We'll find another housekeeper.

00:12.760 --> 00:14.040
And then what did you do?

00:14.040 --> 00:18.040
I took the keys from the sweater and
removed the drugs from the cabinet.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.000
They voted for formal censure.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.520
They voted for formal censure.

00:21.520 --> 00:25.520
They voted for formal censure.

00:27.720 --> 00:30.480
'Tonight on St Elsewhere...'

00:30.480 --> 00:33.000
I was raped.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.160
I know you're concerned.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.120
I know you're concerned.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.360
Tommy! Tommy, stop it!

00:39.360 --> 00:41.480
Tommy, stop it! Stop it!

00:41.480 --> 00:44.640
An autistic teenager
needs structure.

00:44.640 --> 00:45.680
I want your opinion.

00:45.680 --> 00:48.120
I want your opinion.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.560
Shirley, I said 100mls of Lidocaine.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.480
Shirley, I said 100mls of Lidocaine.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.720
You can't work in ER any more.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.200
It's the television documentary.

00:56.200 --> 00:59.560
If you take one frame of film,
I'll punch your lights out.

00:59.560 --> 01:03.560
Maybe you'd prefer I forget the
bypass altogether and we can watch
this man die of a heart attack.

01:07.040 --> 01:11.040
And...action!

03:30.600 --> 03:34.600
ENGINE SPLUTTERS

03:40.400 --> 03:41.840
SPLUTTERS

03:41.840 --> 03:43.480
Do you need any help?

03:43.480 --> 03:47.480
Do you need any help?

03:53.200 --> 03:56.840
I understand you're doing
some kind of TV special.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.080
A documentary, not a variety show.

03:59.080 --> 04:01.440
Weren't notices sent out
to department heads?

04:01.440 --> 04:02.960
Weren't notices sent out
to department heads?

04:02.960 --> 04:06.960
Warning us that TV camera crews will
be trampling through this hospital?

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
You make it sound like a remake of
Ben-Hur. It'll be just a cameraman,

04:13.080 --> 04:14.320
a director...

04:14.320 --> 04:15.360
a director...

04:15.360 --> 04:19.000
What have you got against
a little goodwill publicity?

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
I'm sick and tired of seeing Porter
General and every other hospital
in Boston getting the airtime.

04:25.440 --> 04:29.440
Lord knows, we've seen enough
of St Gregory's on TV this year.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.840
Reporters always disrupt everything.

04:32.840 --> 04:36.080
I'm afraid, Helen,
the board can't give up this chance.

04:36.080 --> 04:39.520
It'll give our fundraising efforts
a boost.

04:39.520 --> 04:43.520
And besides, I'm keeping
a tight rein on these TV guys.

04:43.880 --> 04:47.240
You'll never know they were here.
Look at that.

04:47.240 --> 04:51.240
I mean, that's disgusting.
How is that going to look on TV?

04:51.680 --> 04:55.680
Helen? Get someone
to take care of that!

04:57.400 --> 05:01.400
A star is born.

05:03.640 --> 05:07.400
AMBULANCE SIREN WAILS

05:07.400 --> 05:09.840
I'll be with you in just a second.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.840
That's OK.

05:12.840 --> 05:16.840
Scotty, come on,
I need you here, baby. Excuse me.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.480
Now, can I help you?

05:19.480 --> 05:20.520
Oh...

05:20.520 --> 05:21.880
Oh...

05:21.880 --> 05:25.720
I don't want to bother you.
I may have broken my wrist.

05:25.720 --> 05:28.160
How long ago did this happen?

05:28.160 --> 05:31.400
I don't know...
I'm not sure.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.200
Are you in any pain?

05:33.200 --> 05:35.240
Are you in any pain?

05:35.240 --> 05:37.480
Uh...a little bit, yes.

05:37.480 --> 05:38.520
OK, what's your name?

05:38.520 --> 05:42.000
OK, what's your name?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.040
Roxanne Reed...

05:44.040 --> 05:47.880
All right, if you have a seat
a doctor will be with you.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.320
I have to call my husband.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.760
I have to call my husband.

05:52.760 --> 05:56.760
I'll have to put you on hold.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.440
Roxanne Reed?

06:02.440 --> 06:03.880
Roxanne Reed?

06:03.880 --> 06:05.320
Roxanne Reed?

06:05.320 --> 06:06.960
You have a broken wrist?

06:06.960 --> 06:08.880
You have a broken wrist?

06:08.880 --> 06:12.880
Well, I've got an opening down in
X-ray. Why don't you follow me?
There's no waiting.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.040
Why don't I get you a wheelchair?

06:19.040 --> 06:21.880
Why don't I get you a wheelchair?

06:21.880 --> 06:25.800
X-rays won't take that long.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.800
I was raped, too.

06:45.200 --> 06:49.200
When I was told
my son Tommy was autistic,
I didn't want to believe it.

06:50.640 --> 06:54.640
I took him from colleague
to colleague, hoping something had
been missed along the way,

06:55.760 --> 06:59.760
under the delusion that conflicting
diagnoses meant there still might be
hope. Yes, Paul?

07:01.400 --> 07:05.400
My wife and I had a similar
experience. Every paediatrician
said something different.

07:07.200 --> 07:11.200
One wouldn't allow us to start
therapy because it was too soon.
Another said it's never too soon.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.640
Paul's brought up
a very important point.

07:17.640 --> 07:21.480
For those of you who are new to our
discussion group, I want you to know

07:21.480 --> 07:25.480
that most paediatricians
don't make any evaluations beyond
the initial diagnosis of autism. &gt;

07:26.800 --> 07:30.800
Once that's been made, specialised
clinics such as the Harvard
Child Study Centre will help.

07:32.840 --> 07:35.480
Um...next time we get together,

07:35.480 --> 07:39.480
representatives from several clinics
and the public school system will
be here to explain their programmes.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.720
All right? I guess
that does it, huh? Good night.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.360
Hi.  Hi.

07:55.360 --> 07:58.400
Can you have the kids'
Valentine's Day party at your house?

07:58.400 --> 08:00.240
Can you have the kids'
Valentine's Day party at your house?

08:00.240 --> 08:04.080
I know, but Gary's taking me
on a surprise second honeymoon.

08:04.080 --> 08:07.600
You're one of the few
with a house that's big enough.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.240
OK. But you take 4th of July
and Thanksgiving.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.120
OK. But you take 4th of July
and Thanksgiving.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.160
Want me to pick up Kim?

08:13.160 --> 08:15.800
Want me to pick up Kim?

08:15.800 --> 08:19.800
I wanted you to meet her anyway.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.400
Tommy? Tommy! &gt;

08:31.400 --> 08:34.240
Tommy! Tommy, put that away! Tommy!

08:34.240 --> 08:38.240
Tommy, stop it! Tommy, stop it!
Stop it, Tommy! Tommy...

08:38.880 --> 08:42.600
Tommy, stop it right now!
Tommy...stop it!

08:42.600 --> 08:46.600
Ow!

08:53.000 --> 08:56.600
What happened?

08:56.600 --> 09:00.280
Tommy wanted to set the table
for tomorrow's breakfast.

09:00.280 --> 09:04.280
Tommy, come on. Let's set the table.
Here are the place mats.

09:04.560 --> 09:07.160
I told him he couldn't do that.

09:07.160 --> 09:11.160
Mrs Catalano let him do this
all the time. Let's set the table.

09:11.600 --> 09:15.200
Whatever Mrs Catalano did
was not working, right?

09:15.200 --> 09:18.440
He shouldn't have to scream
and fight to do something.

09:18.440 --> 09:22.440
When you countermand my orders,
it only confuses him.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.880
Tommy, no signing.
You tell me what you want.

09:27.880 --> 09:30.240
Tommy, tell me what you want! &gt;

09:30.240 --> 09:31.280
Napkins.

09:31.280 --> 09:34.280
Napkins.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.480
&lt; Elizabeth...

09:36.480 --> 09:39.200
Tommy needs to learn obedience.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.800
How do YOU know what he needs?
You've been here two weeks.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.640
I've taken care
of other autistic children.

09:45.640 --> 09:49.640
You're not helping. You scold him
every time he does something wrong.

09:49.800 --> 09:53.280
You never work with him either. &gt;

09:53.280 --> 09:57.280
It's almost time for you to go,
so why not just leave now?

09:58.600 --> 10:02.600
I'll talk to your father tomorrow.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.120
Hello, Mrs Reed. I'm Dr Cavanero.

10:07.120 --> 10:11.120
&lt; OK, Mrs Reed, I'll call your
husband now. Temperature's 97.1,
BP is 140 over 92.

10:15.400 --> 10:19.400
I never thought this would happen to
me. I just came to visit a friend.

10:20.600 --> 10:24.600
I want to make sure that
you're all right, so I'll do
a complete physical examination.

10:25.840 --> 10:29.840
If you have any questions or want me
to stop, just let me know.

10:29.880 --> 10:33.800
And did Nurse Daniels speak to you
about collecting evidence?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.160
I signed some consent forms.

10:36.160 --> 10:39.280
That doesn't obligate you
to press charges,

10:39.280 --> 10:43.280
but the hospital is required
to report all incidents.

10:44.080 --> 10:48.080
Now, Mrs Reed... I'm so sorry there
isn't some other place to take you.

10:48.920 --> 10:52.920
We need to do a pelvic exam.
Have you had any gynaecological
problems or operations recently?

10:54.960 --> 10:56.280
No.

10:56.280 --> 11:00.280
I'll be doing a routine exam
and taking test cultures.

11:00.280 --> 11:03.760
Would you lie back?

11:03.760 --> 11:07.200
I-I see my gynaecologist
every six months.

11:07.200 --> 11:11.040
I have a breast examination, too.
I'm very careful.

11:11.040 --> 11:15.040
I have a close friend, the doctor
found a small lump on her ovary.

11:15.880 --> 11:19.880
She took such good care of herself
and they caught it in time.

11:19.960 --> 11:23.960
She's OK now.
I think she's very lucky, don't you?

11:25.400 --> 11:29.000
Annie?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.040
How's she doing?

11:31.040 --> 11:35.040
She's a very brave lady.
If that were me, I'd be hysterical.

11:35.480 --> 11:38.120
She's really holding it together.

11:38.120 --> 11:42.120
The police will send someone over
to ensure chain of evidence.

11:42.160 --> 11:46.160
I hate these things.
It's tough enough to comfort
a patient without playing cop.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.680
Pretty bad break.

11:48.680 --> 11:52.680
Pretty bad break.

11:53.120 --> 11:57.120
Thanks, Fiscus.

12:01.400 --> 12:04.440
Chris...
What are you doing here?

12:04.440 --> 12:06.960
I thought we might go for dinner.

12:06.960 --> 12:10.280
I'd love to,
but I don't know when I'll finish.

12:10.280 --> 12:12.520
The desk said in half an hour.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.760
You know how reliable the desk is.

12:14.760 --> 12:18.760
Now look, Annie, if you don't want
to go, you don't have to.

12:18.880 --> 12:22.880
I'm sorry.
It's just been crazy tonight. Why
don't I call you in the morning?

12:24.240 --> 12:28.240
Fine.  OK?

12:30.400 --> 12:32.240
Actually...

12:32.240 --> 12:36.240
why don't I call you when I finish?

12:37.400 --> 12:41.400
See ya.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.840
How you doing, kiddo?

12:45.840 --> 12:47.680
How you doing, kiddo?

12:47.680 --> 12:49.120
Tommy asleep?

12:49.120 --> 12:52.920
Tommy asleep?

12:52.920 --> 12:54.960
I'm sorry I'm so late.

12:54.960 --> 12:57.400
Dad, I have to talk to you.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.440
OK, what's up?

12:59.440 --> 13:03.280
Miss Clifford and I
got in another fight tonight.

13:03.280 --> 13:06.920
Honey, you two can't be at
each other's throats all the time.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.360
I think she's going to quit.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.400
I think she's going to quit.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.240
She wasn't any good with Tommy
anyhow.

13:13.240 --> 13:16.080
That's what you said
about Mrs Murdoch, remember?

13:16.080 --> 13:17.920
Well, it's true.

13:17.920 --> 13:21.920
Now I have to find someone else
and soon. You go away to college
in the fall and I work...

13:23.560 --> 13:27.560
I know, but we need someone to
encourage Tommy and play with him.

13:27.960 --> 13:31.960
Sweetheart, how will I find anyone
if you keep challenging them?

13:32.040 --> 13:33.560
I don't.  You do!

13:33.560 --> 13:35.800
I've seen you do it.
If they don't treat Tommy...

13:35.800 --> 13:39.400
I've seen you do it.
If they don't treat Tommy...

13:39.400 --> 13:41.760
You have to give them a chance.

13:41.760 --> 13:45.760
Not if they let Tommy slip away.
Haven't you noticed how he's
behaving?

13:46.600 --> 13:50.600
He hardly even talks any more. &gt;

13:51.200 --> 13:54.080
I know you're concerned, darling.

13:54.080 --> 13:58.080
He's ten years old
and acting like he's four! It's
like he's starting all over again.

13:59.960 --> 14:03.960
Lizzie...

14:07.400 --> 14:10.800
(SIGHS)

14:10.800 --> 14:13.800
DOORBELL RINGS

14:13.800 --> 14:17.800
This better not be that little twerp
collecting for his paper route!

14:18.240 --> 14:22.080
He can be damn sure I'll cancel
more than my subscription.

14:22.080 --> 14:26.080
I told him specifically - Saturday
afternoons. Hold it! I'm coming!

14:27.760 --> 14:29.600
Now listen...

14:29.600 --> 14:30.440
Bill Wolfe, WIN.

14:30.440 --> 14:33.280
Bill Wolfe, WIN.

14:33.280 --> 14:36.280
For crying out loud, it's 6.30!

14:36.280 --> 14:37.720
What's going on here, Mark?

14:37.720 --> 14:40.200
What's going on here, Mark?

14:40.200 --> 14:43.600
If you take one frame of film,
I'll punch your lights out.

14:43.600 --> 14:47.080
Look, I feel awful about this.
We can wait in the van.

14:47.080 --> 14:51.080
What for? Just direct yourself down
to Route 128. I'll meet you
at St Eligius, nine o'clock sharp.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.760
I'd like to shoot some film here.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.240
I'd like to shoot some film here.

14:56.240 --> 15:00.240
Like the Kennedys playing football
on the beach at Hyannisport.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.720
Come on, Mark. It's cold out there.

15:02.720 --> 15:03.760
All right, come on in.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.800
All right, come on in.

15:06.800 --> 15:10.800
This is Mike, our cameraman.
And this is our assistant, Jody.
I thought we lost you!

15:12.760 --> 15:16.400
Dr and Mrs Craig,
this is our makeup artist.

15:16.400 --> 15:20.400
Hi. I was asleep in the van.
I can't believe how early it is.

15:20.640 --> 15:24.640
Please, don't let us disturb you.
Just go about your normal routine.

15:25.160 --> 15:28.000
What would you be doing right now?

15:28.000 --> 15:29.840
Sleeping!

15:29.840 --> 15:33.840
OK, why don't you make your way into
the kitchen and I'll fix breakfast?

15:34.680 --> 15:38.680
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Mrs Craig. Great.

15:39.280 --> 15:43.120
Ellen, are you kidding?
You don't have to make breakfast.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.160
What difference does it make?

15:44.160 --> 15:47.000
What difference does it make?

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
And put out the imported preserves.

15:54.400 --> 15:58.240
Then we rode on the monorail.
Didn't we, Pete? Huh?

15:58.240 --> 16:00.240
Went up the Space Needle.

16:00.240 --> 16:04.080
What did your parents think?
Is Pete worthy of the Morrison name?

16:04.080 --> 16:07.520
Are you kidding?
I'd a tug-of-war with my mother!

16:07.520 --> 16:09.480
'Dr Morrison - 4132.'

16:09.480 --> 16:11.720
Can you hold him for a second?

16:11.720 --> 16:15.720
I thought you'd never ask!

16:21.920 --> 16:23.960
Hey, Jack! Welcome back.

16:23.960 --> 16:27.960
Em, this is Dr Morrison.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.320
Who is she?

16:29.320 --> 16:31.360
Who is she?

16:31.360 --> 16:33.200
The lady holding Pete.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.440
The lady holding Pete.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.240
Jack!

16:36.240 --> 16:38.280
Jack!

16:38.280 --> 16:42.240
She's a physical therapist.

16:42.240 --> 16:46.240
I'm not sure.
Every honeymoon is different.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.360
Is she new?

16:47.360 --> 16:51.000
Is she new?

16:51.000 --> 16:54.680
Victor,
it's not worth arguing over.

16:54.680 --> 16:58.680
If Roberta sleeps with her head
at the foot of the bed, let her.
Is that it?

17:00.400 --> 17:02.440
You're welcome.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.800
Bye.

17:04.800 --> 17:08.000
Now what were you saying?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.400
Hm?

17:10.400 --> 17:14.400
No, it's...
Never mind.

17:21.400 --> 17:25.400
Thank you.

17:26.079 --> 17:29.520
You're acting just like you did
when Amy was born

17:29.520 --> 17:33.520
and she had to stay in the hospital
with those horrible ear infections.

17:34.280 --> 17:38.280
I just want to do something for you.
And I can't.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.480
Sweetheart, I know.

17:40.480 --> 17:43.800
KNOCK ON DOOR

17:43.800 --> 17:47.800
Mrs Reed? My name is Sue Follett.
I'm with Social Services
here at the hospital.

17:49.200 --> 17:52.400
Dr Cavanero said you'd be by.
This is George.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.440
Hello, Mr Reed.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.480
Hello, Mr Reed.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.520
Hello, Mr Reed.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.760
I'm available for counselling.

17:58.760 --> 18:02.760
Good. Maybe you can make it clear
to her that she has to forget this.

18:03.800 --> 18:07.800
That's not going to be easy.
Sometimes it helps to talk about it.

18:08.360 --> 18:10.200
I don't see how.

18:10.200 --> 18:14.040
It's similar to talking to our
children about their bad dreams.

18:14.040 --> 18:17.280
This has taken some control
over your life...

18:17.280 --> 18:21.280
This isn't a dream. And it's not
controlling Roxanne's life,
unless they remind you.

18:22.120 --> 18:26.120
Why don't you go on home?

18:26.400 --> 18:28.240
Yeah, I...

18:28.240 --> 18:32.240
I better get ready for work.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.800
I love you.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.240
Shirley!

18:53.240 --> 18:55.680
I hear you made some brownies.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.720
Cupcakes. Help yourself.

18:57.720 --> 19:01.360
Hi, Peter.
Shirley, can you give me a hand?

19:01.360 --> 19:03.320
Oh, sure.

19:03.320 --> 19:05.200
Good.  Thanks!

19:05.200 --> 19:09.000
Somebody, I need help!
He's been electrocuted.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
Right this way!

19:13.000 --> 19:14.440
I don't even know if he's alive!

19:14.440 --> 19:16.880
I don't even know if he's alive!

19:16.880 --> 19:19.320
Yeah, all right.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.160
Yeah, OK.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.800
What happened?

19:22.800 --> 19:24.760
What happened?

19:24.760 --> 19:28.760
He was working on a lady's washing
machine. There was this loud bang
and Leo got knocked across the room.

19:31.400 --> 19:35.400
The electricity shot out his
shoulder. A bright blue flash.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.480
Sir, could you wait outside?

19:37.480 --> 19:39.920
Sir, can you hear me?

19:39.920 --> 19:41.880
His pulse is 40 and irregular.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.720
His pulse is 40 and irregular.

19:43.720 --> 19:46.320
Let's get him on the EKG monitor.

19:46.320 --> 19:49.440
Tell Scotty to start
an IV of D5LR.

19:49.440 --> 19:53.280
Right there. Just right there.
Let me do that.

19:53.280 --> 19:54.320
I got it.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.880
I got it.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.120
You're not supposed to be here.

19:58.120 --> 20:01.840
Give me your pen light.
Pupils are sluggish and dilated.

20:01.840 --> 20:05.840
Shirley,
give me 100mls of Lidocaine.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.840
Shirley, I said give me
100mls of Lidocaine!

20:09.840 --> 20:10.880
This is Wendy's patient.

20:10.880 --> 20:14.400
This is Wendy's patient.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.440
EKG looks like bigeminy.

20:16.440 --> 20:20.440
You're just as much to blame for
giving out those pills as I am.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.920
I saved your tail!

20:22.920 --> 20:26.920
Peter, let her go! Get out of here!

20:27.800 --> 20:31.800
Elevate his feet. Open up the IV
and give me 300ml Vertilium.

20:33.720 --> 20:37.600
Ever since Mrs Catalano left,
Tommy's been in a tailspin. &gt;

20:37.600 --> 20:41.600
He's been unco-operative,
moody, aggressive.

20:42.480 --> 20:45.920
Who's Mrs Catalano?

20:45.920 --> 20:48.520
Oh, sorry. Our housekeeper.

20:48.520 --> 20:52.520
She was a lot more to Tommy,
especially after his mother died.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.600
And now he's drawing Lizzie
into it as well.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.400
In what way?

20:58.400 --> 21:02.400
Manipulating her, trying to get her
to fight his battles for him.

21:03.360 --> 21:05.400
And does she?

21:05.400 --> 21:09.320
More and more.

21:09.320 --> 21:12.280
I took Tommy in for his physical. &gt;

21:12.280 --> 21:16.280
Mary Carlisle suggested he might be
better off in an institution.

21:16.360 --> 21:20.240
Well, you realise that most of them
won't take autistic children,

21:20.240 --> 21:24.240
but I know of an excellent
group home in Natick.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.560
Michael, he's my son.

21:28.560 --> 21:32.400
The three of us are a family.

21:32.400 --> 21:36.400
I only wish I had
more time to give him.

21:37.520 --> 21:40.760
I was lying in bed
last night, awake.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.920
I was tired and frustrated.

21:42.920 --> 21:45.960
And I heard him in the next room.
He was whimpering.

21:45.960 --> 21:48.000
He wanted a glass of water.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.760
I lay there that extra moment,
just listening.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.800
I hoped he'd stop.

21:53.800 --> 21:57.800
Or maybe even get up
and get it for himself.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.920
I'd be very happy to see him.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.920
Actually, Michael, I was hoping
you'd see both Tommy and Elizabeth.

22:07.880 --> 22:11.880
Sure.

22:12.440 --> 22:14.480
CRASHING AND SCREAMING

22:14.480 --> 22:16.920
Help! Get off me! Aagh! Aagh!

22:16.920 --> 22:20.840
No! No! Stay back! Aaagh!
Stay back! Aagh!

22:20.840 --> 22:23.880
Calm down. You're safe. You're safe.

22:23.880 --> 22:26.760
No-one's going to hurt you.
You're safe.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.280
(SOBS)

22:28.280 --> 22:30.880
Now, listen to me, Roxanne.
Ssh, ssh, ssh.

22:30.880 --> 22:34.880
This is going to happen from time to
time, but it's going to get better.

22:44.520 --> 22:48.120
PHONES RINGING

22:48.120 --> 22:51.080
Mike! Let's go to the end
of the hall, OK?

22:51.080 --> 22:53.120
Dr DeBakey, how's it going?

22:53.120 --> 22:57.120
Don't start. These people have been
trailing me since 6.30 this morning.

22:57.480 --> 23:01.120
Dr Craig, we're all set. We can just
film you walking down the hall.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.600
Donald Westphall, meet Bill Wolfe.

23:02.600 --> 23:03.640
Donald Westphall, meet Bill Wolfe.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.680
Donald Westphall, meet Bill Wolfe.

23:05.680 --> 23:06.920
You know each other?

23:06.920 --> 23:10.920
You know each other?

23:10.960 --> 23:14.080
Listen, would you mind
being in this next shot?

23:14.080 --> 23:15.120
No, I've got patients...

23:15.120 --> 23:17.160
No, I've got patients...

23:17.160 --> 23:19.600
You really add a nice touch.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.040
OK.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.160
Jody, check the doctors' make-up.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.200
Wait. We agreed - no make-up.

23:25.200 --> 23:29.040
It's just a little foundation.
I don't want you to look pale.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.680
You should look healthier
than your patients.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.720
Do what you have to do.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.600
We'll shoot you
as you're walking towards us.

23:36.600 --> 23:39.160
I'll let you know when we'll start.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.440
OK?

23:40.440 --> 23:42.440
Why did you turn it down?

23:42.440 --> 23:44.440
I wasn't the right guy, Mark.

23:44.440 --> 23:48.440
Besides, they only asked me
because they thought you'd be
too busy after the transplant.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.120
How about Dr Westphall?

23:51.120 --> 23:52.680
No, really, I don't think...

23:52.680 --> 23:55.320
No, really, I don't think...

23:55.320 --> 23:58.920
I find balding men very attractive.

23:58.920 --> 24:02.200
Uh-huh...

24:02.200 --> 24:03.240
Mm-hm.

24:03.240 --> 24:07.240

24:23.280 --> 24:25.320
Isn't the music a little loud?

24:25.320 --> 24:27.680
Not loud enough to wake up the dead.

24:27.680 --> 24:29.680
(SWITCHES MUSIC OFF)

24:29.680 --> 24:32.320
I need the results
of the Spelling autopsy.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.360
Right there on the desk.

24:34.360 --> 24:36.200
What do you think?

24:36.200 --> 24:38.240
Oh, he's dead all right.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.280
I mean, about his liver?

24:40.280 --> 24:44.280
Cirrhosis, severe ballooning
of the hepatocytes and fibrosis.

24:44.320 --> 24:48.320
But the guy wasn't a drinker.
His enzymes are normal. I'm stumped.

remember?

25:01.040 --> 25:05.040
That's not how I feel about it.

25:17.920 --> 25:19.960
I was doing good, man.

25:19.960 --> 25:23.520
I was doing good.
I mean, I was off the pills.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.720
Things were good at home.

25:25.720 --> 25:29.720
It was like for once,
everything was clicking for me.

25:29.760 --> 25:32.040
Well, it could have been worse.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.840
How?

25:33.840 --> 25:37.840
Huh? I mean, they might as well
just yank my licence off.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.680
I should have been acquitted.

25:40.680 --> 25:43.400
A lot of people think
you got a bum deal.

25:43.400 --> 25:47.240
That really doesn't help me
very much now, does it?

25:47.240 --> 25:49.960
Huh?

25:49.960 --> 25:52.520
Why don't you transfer
to another service?

28:27.280 --> 28:31.280
I always operate with music.

28:32.960 --> 28:36.800
Dr Carlton, why do we use the
saphenous vein for bypass surgery?

28:36.800 --> 28:40.240
Excuse me again.
Can we skip the lectures?

28:40.240 --> 28:42.280
This is a teaching hospital.

28:42.280 --> 28:45.920
I'm not having any problems
with the teaching if you're doing it

28:45.920 --> 28:48.200
Fine.

28:48.200 --> 28:49.760
The saphenous vein...

28:49.760 --> 28:52.000
The saphenous vein...

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
I'd like to zoom the camera in tight
and have you react to the emergency.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.760
I haven't even made
my first cut yet.

28:58.760 --> 29:02.280
We need action, something
to hold the audience's attention.

29:02.280 --> 29:05.200
Maybe you'd prefer
I forget the bypass altogether.

29:05.200 --> 29:08.720
We could all stand around and watch
this man die of a heart attack.

29:08.720 --> 29:09.880
You could film that!

29:09.880 --> 29:13.840
You could film that!

29:13.840 --> 29:17.160
When I agreed to do this,
I was promised

29:17.160 --> 29:20.120
that you'd simply observe
and not interfere.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.160
&lt; So far you haven't done either!

29:22.160 --> 29:25.480
Sorry. It won't happen again.

29:25.480 --> 29:28.520
All right. Let's proceed.

29:28.520 --> 29:32.000
Kochar, what the hell are you doing?

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Um... Excuse me.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.880
Excuse me.

29:36.880 --> 29:39.560
KNOCK AT DOOR

29:39.560 --> 29:42.240
Yeah?

29:42.240 --> 29:43.920
Doctor, hi.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.840
Elizabeth, Tommy.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.960
My dad said you'd be expecting us.

29:47.960 --> 29:51.960
Yeah. Hi, Tommy. Remember me?

30:04.600 --> 30:07.160
So...

30:07.160 --> 30:11.160
I understand Tommy's going through
a pretty rough period right now.

30:11.600 --> 30:12.760
Yeah.

30:12.760 --> 30:16.760
Do you think that's because of
the last two housekeepers you've had

30:16.800 --> 30:18.800
I don't know.

30:18.800 --> 30:22.040
I mean, both of them came
highly recommended

30:22.040 --> 30:24.080
and with good credentials.

30:24.080 --> 30:27.320
But the problem is the people
who write recommendations

30:27.320 --> 30:29.360
don't have to take care of Tommy.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.960
Yeah.

30:30.960 --> 30:34.400
&lt; You know how change
can affect an autistic child.

30:34.400 --> 30:38.280
Tommy just needs someone
who could read his signals

30:38.280 --> 30:41.920
and figure out what he wants
when he can't put it into words.

30:41.920 --> 30:45.920
&lt; Yeah, but that takes
a very long time to develop.

30:47.480 --> 30:50.520
So, you're going to college
in the fall, right?

30:50.520 --> 30:52.560
&lt; Which one is it again?

30:52.560 --> 30:55.840
Vassar. It just seems
so far away, though.

30:55.840 --> 30:59.840
I asked my dad if I should go
to Boston College, but he says no.

30:59.880 --> 31:02.520
Well, do you want to go to BC?

31:02.520 --> 31:06.520
It would be a lot closer to home.

31:07.760 --> 31:11.760
Elizabeth, um...
You're 18 years old, right?

31:12.880 --> 31:16.600
And you've helped take care
of your father and Tommy

31:16.600 --> 31:19.840
practically all of your life.

31:19.840 --> 31:23.840
I mean, there's enough to worry abou
being a sister and a daughter

31:24.000 --> 31:27.160
without trying to be a mother too.

31:27.160 --> 31:30.760
I don't know, I think
that you've got plenty to handle.

31:30.760 --> 31:34.760
Just being a freshman in college
seems like a lot to handle.

31:35.600 --> 31:39.520
Now you're talkin'!

31:39.520 --> 31:41.560
It's quiet here.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.600
That's why I like it.

31:43.600 --> 31:47.600
Here we go.

31:49.480 --> 31:52.360
What did you say
this room used to be?

31:52.360 --> 31:56.120
Part of the animal research lab.
It's been this way for a month.

31:56.120 --> 32:00.120
They assure me every day
that it will be finished any minute.

32:04.840 --> 32:08.840
How do you feel about the attack?

32:11.280 --> 32:14.040
Like I'll never be able
to forget it.

32:14.040 --> 32:16.520
It'll be with me always.

32:16.520 --> 32:19.840
In the beginning,
the images are much more intense.

32:19.840 --> 32:22.120
They will diminish over time.

32:22.120 --> 32:25.520
The first thing I did
when I came into this office

32:25.520 --> 32:29.520
was look for the way out.

32:30.920 --> 32:34.080
I know how this is affecting you.

32:34.080 --> 32:38.080
It's frightening and overwhelming.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.320
He had no right to do that to me.

32:45.320 --> 32:46.640
No.

32:46.640 --> 32:50.640
He had no right to touch me.

32:51.240 --> 32:55.240
He kept kissing me
and asking me if I liked it.

32:57.880 --> 33:01.200
I didn't look at him. I didn't
want him to think I was trying

33:01.200 --> 33:04.040
to see who he was,
so I could recognise him later.

33:04.040 --> 33:08.040
I want you to tell me something.

33:08.200 --> 33:12.200
Tell me how you felt
when you woke up this morning.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.120
I was happy.

33:18.120 --> 33:22.120
George was there. He smiled
and we talked about our children.

33:25.480 --> 33:28.440
I was happy...

33:28.440 --> 33:31.960
..to be alive!

33:31.960 --> 33:35.480
That's right.

33:35.480 --> 33:39.480
That's right.

33:57.680 --> 34:00.360
I don't think this is a good idea.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.400
We're going for cinema verite.

34:02.400 --> 34:06.400
It wouldn't be honest if we excluded
the most painful part of your job.

34:06.440 --> 34:08.960
This is what
your audience wants to see.

34:08.960 --> 34:09.800
Even so.

34:09.800 --> 34:13.040
Even so.

34:13.040 --> 34:17.040
Said she always wanted
to be on television.

34:17.440 --> 34:18.960
All right, OK.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.960
It'll be staggering, believe me.

34:26.600 --> 34:27.440
Mrs Sigfried...

34:27.440 --> 34:29.880
Mrs Sigfried...

34:29.880 --> 34:32.920
It'll be better for the camera.

34:32.920 --> 34:36.360
This'll be fine right here.

34:36.360 --> 34:40.360
Mr Wolfe told me
not to look at the camera.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.560
Mrs Sigfried...

34:42.560 --> 34:45.400
Hold on there, Dr Craig,
we have a sound check.

34:45.400 --> 34:48.239
Test, test.
One, two, three, four. Test.

34:48.239 --> 34:51.360
OK, go ahead.

34:51.360 --> 34:55.360
Mrs Sigfried, because
of your recent heart attack,

34:55.480 --> 34:58.680
elective surgery isn't safe.

34:58.680 --> 35:02.680
Your abdominal aortic aneurysm
could rupture at any time.

35:03.200 --> 35:07.200
I don't quite understand
what you mean.

35:08.640 --> 35:12.640
I'm afraid that the best we could do
is stabilise your heart and wait.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.920
I'm sorry.

35:17.920 --> 35:21.920
Oh...

35:21.920 --> 35:24.920
Damn!

35:24.920 --> 35:27.560
I know, it's a tragedy.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.600
No, we ran out of film.

35:29.600 --> 35:33.480
What?

35:33.480 --> 35:35.920
Look, I feel bad
about this, Dr Craig,

35:35.920 --> 35:38.760
but you're going to have
to tell her again.

35:38.760 --> 35:42.760
(STARTS SOBBING)

35:45.400 --> 35:48.400
Outside, all of you!

35:48.400 --> 35:50.080
Come on.

35:50.080 --> 35:53.240
Out!

35:53.240 --> 35:57.240
&lt; Out!

36:01.760 --> 36:02.800
Hand me the other magazine.

36:02.800 --> 36:06.560
Hand me the other magazine.

36:06.560 --> 36:10.560
I just told that woman
there was nothing we could do
to help her right now.

36:10.920 --> 36:13.400
She came to me, to this hospital,

36:13.400 --> 36:17.400
hoping and praying
that something could be done.

36:17.760 --> 36:20.040
But we've let her down.

36:20.040 --> 36:24.040
Now, we don't serve anyone...

36:24.240 --> 36:26.880
..by sensationalising her tragedy.

36:26.880 --> 36:30.640
Not medicine, not the media
and certainly not Mrs Sigfried. &gt;

36:30.640 --> 36:34.640
The least we can do is to leave her
with a little dignity.

36:36.040 --> 36:40.040
Fabulous. Are you getting this?

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
Get out of this hospital!

36:47.960 --> 36:51.960
All right...

36:59.960 --> 37:03.960
KNOCK AT DOOR

37:41.360 --> 37:45.360
He's only going to get bigger
and stronger, Donald.

37:46.240 --> 37:48.720
And probably more aggressive.

37:48.720 --> 37:52.720
I've never known of an autistic chil
that became less difficult

37:52.880 --> 37:56.880
as he reaches adolescence.

37:57.680 --> 38:01.680
God, I miss my wife!

38:02.040 --> 38:04.720
She always knew how to reach him.

38:04.720 --> 38:08.680
By loving, touching, playing.

38:08.680 --> 38:10.240
Patience.

38:10.240 --> 38:12.680
She knew how to be with him.

38:12.680 --> 38:16.600
She helped me to realise
that Tommy's not an affliction,

38:16.600 --> 38:18.440
but a person.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.320
A gift.

38:20.320 --> 38:24.320
I'm sure her way worked beautifully
when he was younger.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.680
Elizabeth's been talking
to me lately

38:29.680 --> 38:31.720
about going to school locally.

38:31.720 --> 38:35.640
That's not the right approach.
You were right to discourage it.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.920
Sometimes I'm not so sure, Michael.

38:37.920 --> 38:40.480
It could give us all
a sense of continuity.

38:40.480 --> 38:44.480
It would only make the next
transition a lot more difficult.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.960
In the long run, Donald,

38:46.960 --> 38:50.960
you've got to find a way
to make Tommy's needs work.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.160
Michael, I'm aware of that.

38:54.160 --> 38:57.480
I'll spend all of tomorrow morning
interviewing housekeepers.

38:57.480 --> 39:00.720
For the moment,
I'm sure that's the right solution.

39:00.720 --> 39:02.760
What do you mean, "for the moment"?

39:02.760 --> 39:06.280
An autistic teenager will need
a lot more structure in his life

39:06.280 --> 39:10.280
than any housekeeper
can provide for him.

39:14.280 --> 39:18.280
What are my choices?

39:18.320 --> 39:22.320
We could drive out together
to that group home in Natick.

39:23.680 --> 39:27.520
&lt; See what it's like?

39:27.520 --> 39:31.520
It doesn't have to be right away.

39:48.440 --> 39:51.640
(CLEARS THROAT)

39:51.640 --> 39:55.280
By the way, my name's Phil.

39:55.280 --> 39:59.280
Amanda.

39:59.560 --> 40:01.760
I've seen you before.

40:01.760 --> 40:04.400
Well, I... I hang around here.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.200
I mean in Physical Therapy.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.240
I mean in Physical Therapy.

40:07.240 --> 40:11.000
I mean in Physical Therapy.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.200
So, what, you always work so late?

40:13.200 --> 40:17.200
No.

40:17.640 --> 40:21.640
Oh, I got a break coming up.
Would you like to join me for dinner

40:22.560 --> 40:26.240
Actually, I was just leaving.
I've got to catch the T.

40:26.240 --> 40:28.920
Oh. Would you like me
to walk you to the station?

40:28.920 --> 40:32.120
I'm all set, Amanda.
Let me get my coat.

40:32.120 --> 40:34.960
Thanks. Maybe we can make it
some other time.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.880
&lt; I'd love to.

40:36.880 --> 40:38.320
Hi.

40:38.320 --> 40:39.360
Good night, Dr Chandler.

40:39.360 --> 40:43.080
Good night, Dr Chandler.

40:49.120 --> 40:51.160
I'll be sure to be out of town.

40:51.160 --> 40:54.200
By the way, I heard
what you said about Hilton Baronoff

40:54.200 --> 40:56.480
from Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrows.

40:56.480 --> 40:57.520
What?

40:57.520 --> 41:01.360
That he's an incompetent surgeon
with the touch of a blacksmith.

41:01.360 --> 41:03.920
Well, at least
I'm being quoted correctly.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.960
You may want them to delete that.

41:05.960 --> 41:08.720
What about that director?
"More action"?

41:08.720 --> 41:11.000
It's a hospital, for Pete's sake!

41:11.000 --> 41:14.040
What does he think goes on here
all day? Shoot-'em-ups?

41:14.040 --> 41:18.040
No wonder cop shows
are such a success!

41:45.440 --> 41:48.000
You know,

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000

how big you're getting. &gt;

Did you have a nice day?

Dr Ridley likes you very much.

42:01.400 --> 42:05.400
You want book?

42:19.560 --> 42:23.560
Your mommy bought this book for you.

42:37.200 --> 42:41.200
Once there was a little bunny
who wanted to run away.

42:42.400 --> 42:46.400
So he said to his mother,
"I am running away."

42:48.320 --> 42:52.320
"If you run away," said his mother,
"I will run after you.

42:53.480 --> 42:57.480
"For you are my little bunny."

43:00.760 --> 43:04.760
"If you run after me, I will become
a bird and fly away from you,"

43:05.520 --> 43:09.440
said the little bunny.

43:09.440 --> 43:13.440
"If you become a bird and fly away
from me," said his mother...

43:16.640 --> 43:20.640
"..I will be a tree
that you come home to."
