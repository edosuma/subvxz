She'll be okay.

-Yes, of course, <i>beta,</i> she has a phone.

24:00.458 --> 24:02.541
Well, if Kamala's phone
is on your family plan,

24:02.625 --> 24:04.333
you can just log into your account

24:04.416 --> 24:06.708
and use the "find my phone" feature
to see where she is.

I don't.

I left him behind.

two people fell in love
and created something...

as being your mother.

really tight to you,

it's because I am not ready to let you go.
