01:39.722 --> 01:41.349
[Seth] Less than 20% are comfortable

01:41.432 --> 01:44.184
with a president and a vice president
being related in any way.

01:44.267 --> 01:47.688
Less than 10% approve of someone
who's never held elected office.

01:47.771 --> 01:50.065
- But if we can move the needle...
- Forty points?

01:50.148 --> 01:51.400
It's how we frame it.

01:51.484 --> 01:53.736
Her favorables are decent.
They're better than mine.

01:53.819 --> 01:56.530
In a void, but when it comes to her time
as the UN ambassador,

01:56.614 --> 01:57.781
they fall off a cliff.

01:57.865 --> 01:59.867
Performance and experience
are big factors.

01:59.950 --> 02:02.828
Then we have to amplify her strengths,
not her weaknesses.

02:02.911 --> 02:05.998
We're looking for a VP who's an asset.
This research proves she isn't.

02:06.081 --> 02:09.251
Your job is not to dissuade me,
but to figure out how we sell it.

02:09.335 --> 02:12.338
Sir, there are so many people
to choose from.

02:12.421 --> 02:13.422
If the goal is to win,

02:13.506 --> 02:15.298
- and we're bending over backwards--
- Seth.

02:16.258 --> 02:19.637
The president asked us to develop a plan,
so that's what we'll do.

02:22.305 --> 02:23.974
I'll meet you in my office.

02:27.060 --> 02:28.479
[door opens]

02:30.022 --> 02:31.565
- [door closes]
- [Doug sighs]

02:32.483 --> 02:34.985
- You know he's right.
- Well, of course he's right.

02:36.111 --> 02:37.946
Maybe we offer something else.

02:39.156 --> 02:40.908
She won't listen.

02:44.327 --> 02:45.663
What about LeAnn?

02:46.789 --> 02:48.832
Yes, I was thinking that, too.

02:50.292 --> 02:52.335
Question is how to co-opt her.

02:53.504 --> 02:54.588
She likes paychecks.

02:54.672 --> 02:57.257
No, it's gotta be more than money.
She wants coattails.

03:01.887 --> 03:05.265
We swap Claire's for mine.

03:05.348 --> 03:08.018
- Campaign manager?
- We could use some fresh blood.

03:08.101 --> 03:10.228
That I agree with, but LeAnn?

03:10.312 --> 03:11.814
I mean, there's no guarantee
that we can control her.

03:11.897 --> 03:13.649
Yeah, but if she can convince
Claire to change her mind,

03:13.732 --> 03:15.192
- that's all I need.
- [phone beeps]

03:16.276 --> 03:17.486
- [phone beeps]
- Yes.

03:17.570 --> 03:19.404
[woman] <i>They're ready for you</i>
<i>in the Situation Room, sir.</i>

03:19.488 --> 03:20.989
I'll be right there.

03:21.073 --> 03:23.951
You could work with her if you had to.

03:24.034 --> 03:25.453
I don't have to like her to work with her.

03:25.536 --> 03:28.246
- Good, make the call.
- You still want Seth on the plan?

03:28.330 --> 03:31.333
Yes, until LeAnn's on board.
Do I have to worry about him?

03:31.417 --> 03:34.336
We dug pretty deep.
Nothing in his emails or phone records.

03:34.420 --> 03:36.296
He's smart enough
to cover his tracks.

03:37.214 --> 03:38.507
I'll talk to him.

03:54.231 --> 03:55.858
[sighs]

03:59.612 --> 04:03.616
- What do you think of this painting?
- I'm not sure.

04:06.409 --> 04:09.037
Walker and I sat here one night,
stared up at a painting,

04:09.121 --> 04:13.542
the blue one that's in the Oval now.
They replaced it with this.

04:13.626 --> 04:15.335
[Meechum] That's not the American flag.

04:15.418 --> 04:20.841
No, it's the rebel flag...
sinking into oblivion.

04:20.923 --> 04:22.593
Is that a lightning bolt?

04:24.845 --> 04:27.264
Oh, I assume...

04:31.143 --> 04:35.272
Unless it's just a bad attempt
at making the ship a unicorn.

04:35.355 --> 04:37.232
- [chuckles]
- Do you see that?

04:37.315 --> 04:39.067
Colors are nice.

04:39.151 --> 04:40.360
I hate it.

04:41.361 --> 04:43.280
I guess I hate it, too.

04:44.573 --> 04:46.534
I suppose it's not a good idea to have

04:46.617 --> 04:48.869
the Confederate flag
hanging here in the White House

04:48.952 --> 04:51.955
after everything that's happened
in South Carolina.

04:52.039 --> 04:53.874
Even if it is sinking.

04:55.083 --> 04:57.335
What do you think we should put up?

04:57.419 --> 05:00.088
I don't know.
Something you like better.

05:04.301 --> 05:06.720
Do you have that marker
I sign things with?

05:14.102 --> 05:16.438
Put your hand up on the wall.

05:16.522 --> 05:18.524
- Sir?
- Put it on the wall.

05:29.492 --> 05:31.328
[both chuckling]

05:32.913 --> 05:34.915
[Frank] Spread your fingers a little bit.

05:43.298 --> 05:45.258
Wait.
Okay.

05:46.551 --> 05:48.345
[chuckling]

05:48.428 --> 05:53.100
- Yeah... That's enough fun for today.
- [both chuckle]

05:58.772 --> 06:02.693
Doug, I don't know how to do
what he's asking me to do.

06:02.776 --> 06:05.528
- There is not some magical--
- The leaks.

06:06.780 --> 06:10.075
- Was it you?
- Are you serious?

06:10.158 --> 06:11.702
Very.

06:11.785 --> 06:15.080
I handed over all of my correspondence,
just like everyone else.

06:15.163 --> 06:16.999
Doesn't prove anything.

06:17.499 --> 06:19.835
I'm trying to save this campaign.

06:19.918 --> 06:22.379
If I wanted to sabotage it,
I'd let the president do it himself,

06:22.462 --> 06:24.006
instead of fighting back
on this VP thing.

06:24.089 --> 06:25.507
Or that's just a cover.

06:25.590 --> 06:28.426
I've been in the trenches
for the past year

06:28.510 --> 06:31.221
while you've been gone,
and now you doubt me?

06:31.304 --> 06:32.514
I don't need this.

06:33.431 --> 06:35.600
You got this job by digging up dirt.

06:36.518 --> 06:40.563
If you can't trust me by now,
I don't know what I'm doing here.

06:41.481 --> 06:42.983
Are you saying you wanna resign?

06:43.066 --> 06:45.485
That is the last thing that I want,

06:45.568 --> 06:48.030
but you're not giving me
any incentive to stay.

06:52.951 --> 06:56.079
All right.
Fuck it.

06:58.498 --> 06:59.624
[sighs]

06:59.708 --> 07:03.671
Seth, I'm choosing
to believe you right now,

07:03.754 --> 07:05.463
but if I come to regret that decision--

07:05.547 --> 07:09.677
You won't, because it's not me.
I still think it could be Meechum.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.219
It wasn't.

07:11.303 --> 07:13.346
- You're sure?
- I'm positive.

07:13.430 --> 07:14.807
And so is the president.

07:16.349 --> 07:17.851
May I go?

07:17.935 --> 07:20.520
Or did you want to discuss
the plan for the First Lady?

07:20.603 --> 07:24.692
I have some calls to make.
I'll come to your office after.

07:27.402 --> 07:28.862
[door closes]

07:32.115 --> 07:34.159
- [phone beeps]
- Get me LeAnn Harvey.

07:35.118 --> 07:38.455
Milkin will be staying
with this man, Anton Khalski.

07:38.538 --> 07:43.418
He owned the second-largest bank in Russia
until Petrov seized it in 2013.

07:43.501 --> 07:46.129
Khalski fled across the border to Estonia.

07:46.213 --> 07:49.216
We'll have Milkin's plane fly to Tallinn,

07:49.299 --> 07:53.220
then he'll travel by boat
to Khalski's summer house on Saaremaa.

07:53.303 --> 07:55.723
Tomorrow we'll unfreeze
Milkin's American assets

07:55.806 --> 07:58.641
and transfer them
to Khalski's Swiss accounts.

07:58.726 --> 08:01.103
[woman] Khalski will reach out
to his Russian military friends

08:01.186 --> 08:02.813
and then start buying them off.

08:02.896 --> 08:04.898
Are the FSB monitoring Khalski?

08:04.982 --> 08:06.984
Closely.
They'll know we're behind this.

08:07.067 --> 08:09.361
- When Moscow confronts us?
- We'll deny, of course.

08:09.444 --> 08:11.321
Are we prepared if Petrov overreacts?

08:11.404 --> 08:14.116
The Sixth Fleet has a presence
near the Bosphorus,

08:14.199 --> 08:15.868
we have patrols in the North Sea.

08:15.951 --> 08:17.745
- Draft the order.
- Sir, if I may?

08:17.828 --> 08:20.497
- Yeah, we've discussed this, Cathy.
- Yes, sir. I feel obligated

08:20.580 --> 08:23.709
to raise my very strong objections.
The diplomatic cost to us--

08:23.792 --> 08:25.043
If diplomacy were working,

08:25.127 --> 08:28.171
we wouldn't have to consider
this course of action, would we?

08:29.172 --> 08:32.217
- I've voiced my concerns.
- Thank you, everyone.

08:32.842 --> 08:35.053
[door opens and closes]

08:35.136 --> 08:36.889
[phone ringing]

08:38.015 --> 08:39.015
[phone beeps]

08:39.933 --> 08:43.186
You're not going to surprise me
by putting the president on, are you?

08:43.270 --> 08:46.106
[Doug] <i>No, it's just us.</i>
<i>He filled me in, though,</i>

08:46.189 --> 08:48.566
<i>- on the First Lady's request.</i>
- And?

08:48.650 --> 08:51.028
We wanna make you
campaign manager.

08:51.862 --> 08:53.571
<i>Look at your email.</i>

08:57.450 --> 09:00.245
<i>- What is this?</i>
- Our research.

09:00.328 --> 09:04.291
- It all boils down to the same thing.
<i>- You ran a few polls, so what?</i>

09:04.374 --> 09:07.169
- Focus groups, too.
- Meaningless.

09:07.252 --> 09:08.420
<i>Not these numbers.</i>

09:08.503 --> 09:11.131
Claire can't be on the ticket.
You know she can't.

09:11.214 --> 09:13.967
<i>This isn't something
you can isolate on its own.</i>

09:14.051 --> 09:16.636
<i>If gas prices hit $6 a gallon,
you're fucked.</i>

09:16.719 --> 09:19.014
<i>- You lose every key demo.</i>
- We're well aware.

09:19.097 --> 09:21.809
But if the president makes
Claire his running mate,

09:21.892 --> 09:24.895
it makes the conversation
tactical instead of economic.

09:24.978 --> 09:27.940
That buys you time on the Russia crisis.

09:28.023 --> 09:29.983
You solve that,
confidence in the president

09:30.067 --> 09:32.277
translates into confidence
in his choice--

09:32.360 --> 09:36.031
I didn't call you to be convinced.
I called to offer you a job.

09:36.114 --> 09:40.452
- [scoffs] Only to get to Mrs. Underwood.
- This isn't just about her.

09:41.829 --> 09:44.915
We need you.
You'll turn this campaign around.

09:44.998 --> 09:47.750
I'm surprised, Doug.
I didn't think you were very fond of me.

09:47.835 --> 09:51.254
I'm fond of talent.
So is the president.

09:51.922 --> 09:56.426
- My loyalty is to the First Lady.
- All I'm asking is that you talk to her.

09:56.509 --> 09:58.511
I'll tell you what.
I'll show Claire your research

09:58.595 --> 10:00.388
if you show the president mine.

10:01.849 --> 10:03.391
I can agree to that.

10:04.101 --> 10:06.186
I shouldn't even
be talking to you, Heather.

10:06.269 --> 10:08.688
[Dunbar] <i>I'm seriously concerned</i>
<i>that there's been an abuse of power.</i>

10:08.771 --> 10:11.900
Madam Attorney General?
Mr. Stamper, um, is ready to see you now.

10:11.984 --> 10:13.193
I'll be right there.

10:14.569 --> 10:15.695
I gotta go.

10:15.778 --> 10:19.657
The agent in charge of the operation
got a promotion directly after.

10:19.741 --> 10:21.576
- Listen--
<i>- Martha, if the president,</i>

10:21.659 --> 10:24.955
or one of his staff...
If anyone strong-armed the bureau

10:25.038 --> 10:29.126
into pursuing Lucas Goodwin,
then you know that's an abuse of power.

10:29.209 --> 10:30.752
I work for the president.

10:30.836 --> 10:33.046
I am about to sit down
with his Chief of Staff.

10:33.130 --> 10:36.299
<i>- The law is the law.</i>
- This is politics, not the law.

10:36.383 --> 10:40.053
<i>Not true. You brought me on as
solicitor general because of my integrity.</i>

10:40.137 --> 10:42.055
<i>I am bringing this to you
because of yours.</i>

10:42.139 --> 10:43.390
[man] Madam Attorney General.

10:45.893 --> 10:46.977
I really need to go.

10:47.060 --> 10:50.688
<i>- If a sliver of Goodwin's story holds up--</i>
- How did you even find this?

10:50.772 --> 10:52.941
<i>Did your oppo team
speak to someone in WITSEC?</i>

10:53.025 --> 10:56.361
Because if that's the case,
then that sort of breach is not--

10:56.444 --> 11:00.365
<i>- I spoke to him myself, personally.</i>
- You what?

11:00.448 --> 11:04.244
He came to me.
He tracked me down.

11:04.327 --> 11:06.079
I'm not touching this, Heather.

11:07.455 --> 11:09.457
Doug, sorry about that.

11:09.541 --> 11:11.001
- No--
- I was just on with the Chief Justice.

11:11.084 --> 11:12.752
- Don't be silly, come on in.
- Thank you.

11:12.835 --> 11:14.796
- This way.
- Thanks so much.

11:18.633 --> 11:21.219
[woman 1 on laptop] <i>I don't know.</i>
<i>She didn't do that well as ambassador.</i>

11:21.303 --> 11:22.554
<i>She wasn't experienced enough.</i>

11:22.637 --> 11:25.598
[man] <i>Hold on, she was an ambassador?</i>
[woman 1] <i>At the United Nations.</i>

11:25.682 --> 11:26.766
[woman 2] <i>Chris, don't you watch the news?</i>

11:26.849 --> 11:27.892
[man sighs]

11:27.976 --> 11:29.227
[moderator] <i>How many of you feel the same?</i>

11:31.854 --> 11:34.983
<i>Any other reasons,
besides lack of experience?</i>

11:35.067 --> 11:38.528
[woman 2] <i>Well, she was really impulsive</i>
<i>when she had that outburst in Moscow.</i>

11:38.611 --> 11:40.948
[woman 1] <i>Well, she never should've</i>
<i>been there in the first place.</i>

11:41.031 --> 11:44.117
<i>I mean, the Senate voted her down,
and then her husband just appoints her?</i>

11:44.201 --> 11:45.285
<i>That's not right.</i>

11:45.368 --> 11:48.580
<i>Okay, see, I like her
as a person, but I agree,</i>

11:48.663 --> 11:50.832
<i>she should stick to being First Lady.</i>

11:52.834 --> 11:55.170
So, he's hoping
you'll convince me to let it go.

11:55.253 --> 11:57.755
Look, I'd make a killing
compared to what you've paid me,

11:57.839 --> 12:00.717
but you and I talked about
making a real mark.

12:05.055 --> 12:06.264
[sighs]

12:09.892 --> 12:11.853
My father really liked Francis.

12:13.355 --> 12:16.108
But as my daddy, he said to me,
the day before we got married,

12:16.191 --> 12:17.775
"You have one life, Claire.

12:18.693 --> 12:21.989
Are you sure this is the man
you wanna spend it with?"

12:22.072 --> 12:23.991
What did you say?

12:24.074 --> 12:27.285
I said I didn't want
to live my life full of doubts.

12:27.369 --> 12:29.871
Well, I think Francis
wants me to doubt myself.

12:29.954 --> 12:31.789
[thudding]

12:31.873 --> 12:36.419
- What was that?
- My mother... killing a lizard.

12:39.881 --> 12:42.175
[footsteps approaching]

12:49.641 --> 12:52.727
- I'll get the door for you, ma'am.
- I can open the door myself.

13:05.115 --> 13:07.992
Watch your step.
There's blood on the floor.

13:15.083 --> 13:18.503
I want you to take this
to the president, in person.

13:18.586 --> 13:22.507
- Try to get on a plane tonight if you can.
- Of course.

13:25.552 --> 13:29.597
- [R&B music playing]
- [door opens and closes]

13:33.601 --> 13:35.728
- [sighs]
- This one's for you.

13:37.897 --> 13:41.234
- It's warm.
- At least it's free.

13:43.528 --> 13:45.655
I may need to cash in my insurance.

13:47.031 --> 13:48.408
What's going on?

13:49.367 --> 13:53.413
Tell me what my position would be
if she wins the nomination.

13:54.539 --> 13:55.873
Is it the attorney general?

13:57.084 --> 13:59.586
- The what?
- Never mind.

13:59.669 --> 14:00.962
For running mate?

14:01.045 --> 14:04.006
It's way too early for running mates.
He hasn't even won.

14:04.757 --> 14:07.552
- Are we talking about the same thing?
- You go first.

14:07.635 --> 14:10.972
- Uh-uh. It doesn't work that way.
- Well, you're the one looking for a job.

14:11.055 --> 14:12.307
You can either involve me,

14:12.390 --> 14:15.268
or you can start reading headlines
about Dunbar pushing a marriage story.

14:15.352 --> 14:17.854
[scoffs] That would blow you up.

14:18.563 --> 14:21.566
Doug's already suspicious.
I've got nothing to lose.

14:21.649 --> 14:23.193
So which is it?

14:24.777 --> 14:26.446
Lucas Goodwin.

14:27.739 --> 14:30.200
He was an editor... at <i>The Herald,</i>
the one who--

14:30.283 --> 14:32.744
- We spoke to him.
- Isn't he in prison?

14:33.370 --> 14:35.205
Not anymore.

14:40.543 --> 14:43.296
[woman] He's scheduled to depart
at 0930 hours.

14:43.380 --> 14:46.007
That'll put him in Tallinn
shortly before dawn.

14:46.091 --> 14:49.177
Our station chief is standing by
with the escort to Saaremaa.

14:49.261 --> 14:51.179
This is the executive order.

14:53.223 --> 14:55.225
- Sir--
- Cathy, I've made my decision.

14:55.308 --> 14:57.769
- Hourly updates once he lands.
- Yes, sir.

14:58.811 --> 15:00.563
Thank you all very much.

15:02.649 --> 15:04.401
Tell Doug I'm ready.

15:10.031 --> 15:11.908
Please, have a seat, LeAnn.

15:13.368 --> 15:14.577
[door closes]

15:14.661 --> 15:17.038
I'm delighted you've agreed
to come on board.

15:17.122 --> 15:19.166
It's my understanding
there is a condition attached.

15:19.249 --> 15:20.417
Well, yes.

15:20.500 --> 15:24.254
And she understands that condition?
You've spoken with her?

15:24.337 --> 15:26.339
Oh, my apologies, sir.
I wasn't clear.

15:26.423 --> 15:28.925
I meant our condition, not yours.

15:50.029 --> 15:51.906
On Super Tuesday.

15:55.452 --> 15:58.330
It's a long trip
to deliver this in person.

15:58.413 --> 16:02.334
[LeAnn] Well, it's not the sort of thing
you'd want to end up in the wrong hands.

16:05.878 --> 16:10.925
- Are you staying here in Washington?
- No, I'm going straight back.

16:11.008 --> 16:13.428
Is there anything you'd like me
to tell the First Lady?

16:13.511 --> 16:16.055
Tell her she'll have her answer
by this evening.

16:16.138 --> 16:20.310
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Have a safe trip back, Ms. Harvey.

16:22.395 --> 16:24.481
I'll show myself out.

16:27.859 --> 16:29.319
[door closes]

16:31.196 --> 16:34.449
[Claire] <i>For quite some time, the</i>
<i>president and I have been growing apart.</i>

16:34.532 --> 16:35.742
[Frank] Have Meechum step in here.

16:35.825 --> 16:37.577
[Claire] <i>We've attempted</i>
<i>to save our marriage,</i>

16:37.660 --> 16:40.455
<i>but after great effort,
I've come to the conclusion</i>

16:40.538 --> 16:42.164
<i>that it can't be saved.</i>

16:42.249 --> 16:45.543
<i>It is with great regret
that I announce today</i>

16:45.627 --> 16:48.045
<i>I'm filing for divorce.</i>

16:48.129 --> 16:51.132
- We have to stop her.
- Before she gets to the airport?

16:51.216 --> 16:52.884
No, I mean Claire.

16:52.967 --> 16:54.010
[door opens]

16:54.802 --> 16:55.887
You asked for me, sir?

16:56.596 --> 16:58.265
Come in.

16:58.348 --> 17:00.808
[phone dialing]

17:00.892 --> 17:02.394
[line beeping]

17:04.185 --> 17:05.771
Both the cell and the landline--

17:05.855 --> 17:07.898
We're on lockdown, ma'am.
We had to scramble all the--

17:07.982 --> 17:09.776
Lockdown?
What are you talking about?

17:09.858 --> 17:11.653
I'm gonna need you to stay in the house.

17:11.736 --> 17:13.945
- What--
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

17:14.030 --> 17:15.740
You can't force me to stay in here.

17:15.823 --> 17:18.200
There is a current, highly credible
threat to your life--

17:18.285 --> 17:19.618
I need to speak to your supervising--

17:19.702 --> 17:22.454
I am the head of your detail
here in Dallas, ma'am,

17:22.539 --> 17:25.207
and I've been ordered
to keep you securely in this house.

17:27.335 --> 17:28.670
[phone clicks]

17:31.839 --> 17:33.383
[door opening]

17:33.466 --> 17:35.593
[phone dialing]

17:35.677 --> 17:37.304
- [line beeping]
- [door closing]

17:38.220 --> 17:39.889
[indistinct radio chatter]

17:42.267 --> 17:44.269
[crowd cheering and clapping]

17:57.239 --> 17:58.741
Go Underwood!

18:00.493 --> 18:02.412
[shushing]

18:02.495 --> 18:03.871
Listen.

18:03.955 --> 18:08.293
[crowd chanting] Blunderwood!
Blunderwood!

18:08.376 --> 18:11.671
Do you know what they're chanting?
"Blunderwood."

18:11.754 --> 18:13.465
[crowd chuckling]

18:13.548 --> 18:15.049
And if I were their English professor,

18:15.132 --> 18:17.259
why, I would give them all
an "A" for cleverness...

18:17.344 --> 18:20.555
- [crowd laughing]
- ...but a "D" for accuracy.

18:20.638 --> 18:24.809
- [crowd chuckling]
- But that's part of being president.

18:24.892 --> 18:26.436
You make enemies,

18:26.519 --> 18:29.564
and you can hear some of mine
just outside, right now.

18:30.272 --> 18:32.400
So, I am grateful
to each and every one of you

18:32.484 --> 18:34.068
for coming out and showing
your support today.

18:34.151 --> 18:36.904
It's because of you
we will win this nomination,

18:36.988 --> 18:39.782
and that's why I came
to your college today.

18:39.866 --> 18:41.326
[crowd cheering]

18:46.163 --> 18:50.001
Now, of course, I knew that there
would be protesters here today...

18:50.084 --> 18:52.920
and I could've chosen not to come,

18:53.004 --> 18:55.965
or I could choose
to avoid them as I leave,

18:56.048 --> 18:57.174
but I'm not going to do that,

18:57.258 --> 19:00.595
because those students out there,
your fellow classmates,

19:00.678 --> 19:02.680
I'm their president, too.

19:02.764 --> 19:06.893
And whether they vote for me or not,
I have to lead them as well.

19:06.976 --> 19:10.647
So, it's important to hear them,
to talk to them,

19:10.730 --> 19:12.940
to listen to their ideas,

19:13.024 --> 19:15.777
because, just as you're learning
in college,

19:15.860 --> 19:19.280
a diversity of ideas makes us all wiser,

19:19.364 --> 19:22.784
and that holds true
even for your president.

19:22.867 --> 19:27.079
True leadership is not running away
from those who disagree with you,

19:27.163 --> 19:28.540
but embracing them,

19:28.623 --> 19:30.958
and that is exactly what I intend to do
when I'm done today.

19:31.042 --> 19:33.378
I'm gonna go out
and embrace that entire crowd.

19:33.461 --> 19:35.212
[crowd clapping and cheering]

19:46.307 --> 19:50.227
- Shouldn't we be taking a military plane?
- That would draw attention.

19:50.311 --> 19:51.438
Relax.

19:51.521 --> 19:54.315
Everything's been worked out.
You're in good hands.

19:55.650 --> 19:57.944
Here, get some sleep.

19:59.278 --> 20:01.030
It's gonna be a long trip tonight.

20:14.043 --> 20:17.547
- [people shouting]
- [chanting] Blunderwood! Blunderwood!

20:17.630 --> 20:20.633
- Any news?
- Everything's secure, sir.

20:21.342 --> 20:23.678
- [man 1] We love you, Underwood!
- [chanting continues]

20:25.387 --> 20:26.431
Thank you all for coming out,

20:26.514 --> 20:29.058
even those of you
who don't entirely support me.

20:29.141 --> 20:32.311
- [man 2] Way to go, Mr. President!
- Thank you.

20:32.394 --> 20:35.773
I wanna try to hear what it is
that you disagree with me about.

20:35.857 --> 20:38.067
I understand not everyone's for me.

20:38.651 --> 20:42.238
- No more wars!
- [woman 1] Go back to Gaffney!

20:42.321 --> 20:44.616
Hello, how are you?
Thank you for coming out.

20:44.699 --> 20:45.992
Hello, thank you for coming out.

20:46.075 --> 20:48.410
[man 3] You're doing a great job!
[woman 2] We know what you are!

20:48.495 --> 20:50.162
[Frank] Hello.

20:50.913 --> 20:53.040
All right,
I'm here to try to listen to you,

20:53.124 --> 20:56.002
but probably one at a time
is gonna be a little better.

20:56.085 --> 20:59.213
Okay, maybe we could have a conversation,
more one-on-one.

20:59.296 --> 21:00.715
It's difficult to hear you.

21:00.798 --> 21:03.635
I understand what you don't believe in,
but what are you for?

21:03.718 --> 21:05.553
That would be a good question.
All right, how about you?

21:05.637 --> 21:07.221
You've been yelling at me
for a little while.

21:07.304 --> 21:08.765
What do you think
I should be doing differently?

21:08.848 --> 21:10.141
- You should resign.
- Well, now,

21:10.224 --> 21:11.518
I'm not asking for your vote,

21:11.601 --> 21:13.603
but what would you do
if you were president?

21:13.686 --> 21:15.354
You're ruining our country!

21:15.437 --> 21:17.439
I came out here to try to listen
to what you wanna say,

21:17.524 --> 21:19.108
but if all you're gonna do is scream--

21:19.191 --> 21:20.610
- [gunshots]
- [man 4] Gun!

21:20.693 --> 21:22.695
[all screaming]

21:22.779 --> 21:24.071
[grunts]

21:28.785 --> 21:30.870
[man 5] Let's go! Let's go!

21:30.953 --> 21:32.997
[man 5] Move! Move!
[man 6] Go, go, go!

21:34.165 --> 21:35.708
[siren wailing]

21:41.130 --> 21:44.884
[anchor on TV] <i>There has been an attempted</i>
<i>assassination of the president.</i>

21:44.967 --> 21:48.095
<i>President Frank Underwood has been shot.</i>

21:48.179 --> 21:52.433
<i>It occurred about ten minutes ago
during a campaign event</i>

21:52.517 --> 21:54.602
<i>at Hammond University
in Washington, D.C.</i>

21:54.686 --> 21:58.731
<i>We do not yet know how severely
the president has been wounded.</i>

21:58.815 --> 22:01.609
<i>He is en route
to Jefferson Memorial Hospital.</i>

22:01.693 --> 22:05.279
<i>We don't know how serious
his condition may be.</i>

22:05.362 --> 22:09.366
<i>Footage of the assassination attempt
is still making its way to us,</i>

22:09.450 --> 22:12.161
<i>and we expect to have that shortly.</i>

22:12.244 --> 22:15.665
<i>Witnesses are reporting that there was
a quick succession of gunshots,</i>

22:15.748 --> 22:17.124
<i>four or five,</i>

22:17.208 --> 22:20.920
<i>a lone gunman whose identity
we are still trying to determine.</i>

22:21.003 --> 22:23.297
<i>We've been told the gunman was killed,</i>

22:23.380 --> 22:25.382
<i>as well as at least one
Secret Service agent,</i>

22:25.466 --> 22:29.136
<i>but we don't have
definitive confirmation of that yet.</i>

22:29.220 --> 22:33.265
<i>We don't yet know who the gunman
may be or who the agent is.</i>

22:33.349 --> 22:35.559
- What's happened?
- [agent] The president's been shot.

22:36.518 --> 22:38.270
[TV anchor] <i>I'm hearing now</i>
<i>that the president</i>

22:38.354 --> 22:41.440
<i>received at least one gunshot
to the abdomen, possibly more,</i>

22:41.523 --> 22:44.861
<i>that he clutched his stomach,
that he fell instantly to the ground,</i>

22:44.944 --> 22:46.863
<i>and there were screams,
people panicking,</i>

22:46.946 --> 22:49.782
<i>that it has been very chaotic
at that scene.</i>

22:49.866 --> 22:51.868
<i>We have very little information
at this time,</i>

22:51.951 --> 22:55.246
<i>other than shots were fired,
the president wounded.</i>

22:55.329 --> 22:57.373
<i>But as I say, he is alive.</i>

22:57.456 --> 23:00.793
<i>We've gotten no official statement
from the White House as of yet,</i>

23:00.877 --> 23:02.670
<i>either the president's precise condition</i>

23:02.754 --> 23:05.757
<i>or the whereabouts
of Vice President Blythe.</i>

23:05.840 --> 23:09.551
<i>He is believed to be at the White House.
We cannot confirm that,</i>

23:09.636 --> 23:12.596
<i>nor do we know if he will
take over as acting president,</i>

23:12.680 --> 23:14.891
<i>assuming the duties of the presidency</i>

23:14.974 --> 23:18.602
<i>under the terms of the 25th Amendment
to the Constitution.</i>

23:18.686 --> 23:20.688
<i>That would seem likely, however,</i>

23:20.772 --> 23:24.734
<i>if the president's wounds are
as serious as we believe them to be.</i>

23:25.693 --> 23:27.695
<i>This is a difficult moment
for the country.</i>

23:27.779 --> 23:30.614
<i>It is not the first time
that a president has been shot</i>

23:30.698 --> 23:33.910
<i>in my lifetime or in many of yours.</i>

23:33.993 --> 23:36.913
<i>But even for those of us
who have experienced this before,</i>

23:36.996 --> 23:40.457
<i>it is no less of a shock,
it is no less terrifying.</i>

23:41.834 --> 23:44.420
<i>It is the moment
when our nation's resilience,</i>

23:44.503 --> 23:46.047
<i>when our collective strength,</i>

23:46.130 --> 23:50.134
<i>the moment when all of that
is tested the most.</i>

23:50.217 --> 23:54.764
<i>And we can only imagine how difficult
it must be for the First Lady.</i>

24:00.770 --> 24:03.564
- Francis--
- Michael told me.

24:08.277 --> 24:10.404
I have to go back to Washington.

24:11.989 --> 24:14.408
Well, what are you waiting for?

24:17.328 --> 24:19.747
Do you expect me to console you?

24:21.457 --> 24:22.917
No, I just...

24:24.335 --> 24:27.421
- Goodbye, Mother.
- [Elizabeth] Claire.

24:28.380 --> 24:30.883
I hope he dies.

24:38.850 --> 24:42.686
Claire, I can't imagine
how difficult this must be.

24:42.770 --> 24:44.396
Is there anything I can do?

24:44.480 --> 24:46.357
I appreciate the call, Mr. Vice President,

24:46.440 --> 24:48.735
but I'm sure you've got
a lot to take care of right now.

24:48.818 --> 24:52.613
<i>- Is there anything I can do to help you?</i>
- I'll be making a brief appearance

24:52.696 --> 24:56.743
once we have a better sense of...
where things stand.

24:56.826 --> 24:58.786
Would you like me to be there?

24:58.870 --> 25:02.123
I think it would be good,
the country seeing the First Lady.

25:03.165 --> 25:05.960
<i>I think it's more important
that they see your steady hand.</i>

25:06.043 --> 25:09.505
If you're by my side,
it would certainly make it steadier.

25:09.588 --> 25:12.424
Of course. Anything you ask.

25:12.508 --> 25:16.053
<i>I'm gonna be praying for you.
For both of you.</i>

25:16.137 --> 25:17.679
<i>Thank you, Don.</i>

25:23.269 --> 25:24.478
[sighs]

25:26.981 --> 25:28.107
Okay.

25:36.198 --> 25:37.909
[inhales]

25:39.118 --> 25:40.619
[Doug] This way, sir.

25:45.792 --> 25:47.418
[breathes deeply]

26:22.870 --> 26:24.413
Thank you, sir.

26:25.789 --> 26:29.335
The acting president needs to be briefed
on a highly classified matter.

26:29.418 --> 26:31.670
Everyone without military clearance,
we'll need the room.

26:42.974 --> 26:44.808
<i>It was in fact two shots.</i>

26:44.892 --> 26:48.395
<i>One that grazed the torso
just beneath the right arm</i>

26:48.479 --> 26:52.483
<i>and the second which entered the abdomen,
possibly into his liver.</i>

26:52.566 --> 26:55.987
<i>Obviously, it was that shot
that did the greatest damage.</i>

26:56.070 --> 27:00.282
<i>The president is currently
reported to be in critical condition.</i>

27:00.366 --> 27:01.658
<i>The Secret Service agent</i>

27:01.742 --> 27:04.620
<i>that was killed protecting the president
was Edward Meechum.</i>

27:04.703 --> 27:08.374
<i>He is the head of the president's detail,
and we can confirm that now.</i>

27:08.457 --> 27:11.377
<i>After being shot and before he died,</i>

27:11.460 --> 27:15.882
<i>he killed the assailant
whose identity is still unknown.</i>

27:15.965 --> 27:18.175
<i>We're waiting now on a press conference
from the White House</i>

27:18.259 --> 27:19.593
<i>from Press Secretary Seth Grayson,</i>

27:19.676 --> 27:23.514
<i>and we expect to have that
beginning in just a few moments.</i>

27:23.597 --> 27:27.518
We confirm nothing unless
you run it past me twice first,

27:27.601 --> 27:28.727
- I don't want--
- [woman] Mr. Grayson...

27:28.810 --> 27:31.730
I'm on my way.
We don't want any rumors, only facts.

27:31.813 --> 27:33.524
There's a student who's claiming
it was the Secret Service

27:33.607 --> 27:35.734
- who fired the first shot.
- What did I just say?

27:35.817 --> 27:39.113
- Do not waste my time with that bullshit.
- [woman] Sir, the press is waiting.

27:39.196 --> 27:41.115
All right, I'm... I'm coming.
Uh, where's my...

27:41.198 --> 27:42.950
[indistinct chatter]

27:45.077 --> 27:47.038
- [indistinct chatter]
- [camera shutters clicking]

27:47.121 --> 27:50.499
At 12:38 this afternoon,
Vice President Donald Blythe

27:50.582 --> 27:52.960
was authorized as acting president
by the cabinet.

27:53.044 --> 27:55.254
He is currently meeting with them.

27:55.337 --> 27:58.549
Approximately 20 minutes ago,
the First Lady landed at Andrews.

27:58.632 --> 28:01.385
<i>She is expected to arrive
at the hospital shortly.</i>

28:05.806 --> 28:08.642
- [Dr. Saxon] Mrs. Underwood.
- How is he?

28:08.725 --> 28:11.395
They're still in the OR.
Probably a few hours left to go.

28:13.272 --> 28:15.149
Is he going to live?

28:15.232 --> 28:18.527
He took a direct hit to his liver,
which is partially shattered.

28:18.610 --> 28:21.905
Fortunately, part of the left lobe
is mostly intact.

28:23.490 --> 28:26.410
Now, we think there's a decent chance
he will survive surgery,

28:26.493 --> 28:30.039
but even if he does,
that's when the real fight begins.

28:31.165 --> 28:33.084
I'd like to see him.

28:33.167 --> 28:35.669
As soon as he's out,
I'll make sure you know.

28:35.752 --> 28:37.338
Okay, thank you.

28:40.466 --> 28:41.883
[door opens]

28:45.387 --> 28:46.847
[door closes]

28:58.317 --> 29:02.904
I'd recommend we call off this operation,
we turn the plane around now.

29:02.989 --> 29:06.283
I disagree. It's well planned.
The president already signed off.

29:06.367 --> 29:07.994
The president might die.

29:08.077 --> 29:12.206
- Madam Secretary...
- We'll have no talk like that, Cathy.

29:13.082 --> 29:14.333
My apologies, sir.

29:14.416 --> 29:19.463
What I am trying to say is that
it is too risky to antagonize--

29:19.546 --> 29:21.423
The point was to scare them,
not--

29:21.507 --> 29:25.427
To do anything of this nature while
the commander in chief is incapacitated,

29:25.511 --> 29:27.138
- the Russians will take--
- We're at high alert.

29:27.221 --> 29:29.056
We're prepared for all eventualities.

29:29.140 --> 29:30.891
We don't want the military
to be the fail-safe here.

29:30.975 --> 29:34.145
Mr. Vice...
[clears throat] Mr. President...

29:35.354 --> 29:38.440
I believe it is our duty to carry out
the orders that the president signed.

29:38.524 --> 29:42.569
- The circumstances have changed.
- The plan is sound.

29:44.530 --> 29:47.866
So, what would you like to do, sir,
continue the mission or abort?

29:49.951 --> 29:54.123
- Uh, I... I wanna think on it.
- He's scheduled to land in two hours.

29:54.206 --> 29:56.708
I just want...
[stutters and sighs]

29:56.792 --> 29:59.378
I've gotta think.
Let's take a break.

29:59.461 --> 30:02.089
I, uh, I need to process all this.

30:12.433 --> 30:13.517
Sir?

30:16.270 --> 30:19.315
- The president weighed everything--
- Cathy brought up some good points.

30:19.398 --> 30:21.192
She's been against this
from the very beginning,

30:21.275 --> 30:24.528
- but the president clearly--
- Just give me some time, Doug, please?

30:24.611 --> 30:27.031
I've got too many people
barking in my ear.

30:37.166 --> 30:39.626
The president is out of surgery,

30:39.710 --> 30:41.962
and he is in stable
but critical condition.

30:42.046 --> 30:43.547
[all clamoring]

30:44.465 --> 30:48.385
Excuse me! Excuse me!
We are going to keep this orderly.

30:48.469 --> 30:50.262
Dr. Saxon will finish his statement,

30:50.346 --> 30:52.723
and then we'll answer your questions.
Thank you.

30:52.806 --> 30:57.269
The surgery lasted six hours, 28 minutes.
Three quarters of his liver was removed.

30:57.353 --> 31:00.272
A liver, even one quarter of a liver,

31:00.356 --> 31:03.734
has the ability to regenerate
within six to eight weeks.

31:03.817 --> 31:06.528
We will be conducting
blood tests every hour.

31:06.612 --> 31:08.780
Enzymes, ammonia levels, PT times,

31:08.864 --> 31:10.907
I believe these are all
explained in the handout.

31:10.991 --> 31:13.034
<i>...the medical report,
live from the White House,</i>

31:13.119 --> 31:14.828
<i>which we will return to shortly.</i>

31:14.911 --> 31:16.913
<i>But we have breaking news we're following.</i>

31:16.997 --> 31:19.666
<i>The would-be assassin
was previously reported</i>

31:19.750 --> 31:22.586
<i>as John Carlyle from Dayton, Ohio,</i>

31:22.669 --> 31:25.964
<i>but sources in the Department of Justice
now say this was actually</i>

31:26.047 --> 31:30.302
<i>an alias for Lucas Goodwin,</i>
<i>a former editor at</i> The Washington Herald

31:30.386 --> 31:34.181
<i>who was convicted of cyberterrorism
nearly two years ago.</i>

31:34.265 --> 31:37.851
<i>Now, if we freeze this cell phone footage
of the shooting</i>

31:37.934 --> 31:42.189
<i>and we compare the shooter's face
to this picture of Goodwin...</i>

31:42.273 --> 31:44.566
<i>well, the comparison is striking</i>

31:44.650 --> 31:49.196
<i>and would seem to confirm what we're
hearing from our sources in the DOJ,</i>

31:49.280 --> 31:53.950
<i>who say Goodwin was recently released
and is in a witness protection program.</i>

31:55.244 --> 31:57.788
It's so strange to think that I--

31:57.871 --> 32:00.874
It was, what?
Just two hours before? Less than.

32:02.042 --> 32:03.877
How did he react?

32:03.960 --> 32:07.214
<i>He was cold, I guess.
I couldn't really read him.</i>

32:08.757 --> 32:10.384
He looks so weak.

32:11.343 --> 32:15.096
- Should I come back to Washington?
<i>- Let's see how the next couple of days go.</i>

32:16.640 --> 32:18.600
Well, just say the word,
I'm on a plane.

32:19.893 --> 32:22.229
All right, thank you, LeAnn.
Good night.

32:22.313 --> 32:23.647
<i>Good night.</i>

32:27.568 --> 32:28.985
[EKG beeping]

32:29.069 --> 32:31.071
Francis, can you hear me?

32:40.456 --> 32:41.707
Francis.

32:43.083 --> 32:45.252
- [knocking on door]
- [door opens]

32:47.754 --> 32:52.176
I just spoke to Eddie's parents, ma'am.
You said you wanted to call them?

32:52.259 --> 32:53.802
Yes, thank you.

32:57.389 --> 33:01.393
Edward was more than a hero, Mrs. Meechum.
He was our friend.

33:02.353 --> 33:04.438
I'm so sorry for your loss.

33:07.148 --> 33:11.737
Please, let me know if there's anything
I can do for you and your family.

33:11.820 --> 33:13.780
You can call me anytime.

33:14.906 --> 33:19.328
Yes, ma'am, that is my private number.
And again, I'm so sorry.

33:27.961 --> 33:30.381
- Lucas Goodwin?
- We didn't know he was out.

33:30.464 --> 33:32.591
How can that happen?
He's released and you didn't know--

33:32.674 --> 33:35.010
Ma'am... as far as threats go,

33:35.093 --> 33:37.304
we've been far more occupied
with you lately.

33:39.890 --> 33:43.101
I'm hoping that we can work together,
because I need your help.

33:44.185 --> 33:46.897
- How?
- The vice president.

33:46.980 --> 33:49.608
We spoke.
I told him I would appear with him.

33:49.691 --> 33:50.776
Not the statement.

33:51.735 --> 33:53.945
He's having trouble making a decision.

33:54.029 --> 33:56.657
Can you come back
to the White House with me?

33:58.867 --> 34:02.746
It's serious, ma'am.
I can fill you in on the way.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.252
I'll grab my things.

34:16.134 --> 34:17.678
[clears throat]

34:18.804 --> 34:21.973
- I can't let you go any farther, sir.
- I'm his Chief of Staff.

34:22.056 --> 34:26.101
I'm sorry, sir.
Only doctors and the First Lady for now.

34:47.373 --> 34:48.792
- [knocking on door]
- [door opens]

34:50.210 --> 34:51.420
Claire.

34:52.629 --> 34:53.880
Hello.

34:53.964 --> 34:57.301
[sighs] How are you?

34:57.384 --> 34:58.885
- Exhausted.
- I'm sure.

34:58.969 --> 35:00.346
You must be, too.

35:00.429 --> 35:04.933
There's so much I don't know.
It's... overwhelming.

35:05.016 --> 35:08.228
Sir, I briefed the First Lady
on the Milkin operation.

35:08.312 --> 35:09.438
I thought she might have some insight,

35:09.521 --> 35:12.232
given her experience
working directly with Russia.

35:12.316 --> 35:15.569
I know you've had a lot of people
weigh in already.

35:16.487 --> 35:19.740
I value your input, Claire.
I'm glad you're here.

35:21.074 --> 35:24.745
- Douglas, will you give us a minute?
- Of course.

35:24.828 --> 35:26.455
I'll be with the cabinet, sir.

35:28.915 --> 35:30.208
You know that thing that people say,

35:30.291 --> 35:32.085
"God never gives you
more than you can handle"?

35:32.168 --> 35:33.211
- [door closes]
- Yes.

35:33.294 --> 35:36.089
[sighing] My Marjory,
God bless her,

35:36.172 --> 35:38.550
she said that was pure bullshit.

35:38.634 --> 35:40.636
[both chuckle]

35:42.554 --> 35:46.266
Oh, listen to me complaining while
your husband is fighting for his life.

35:46.350 --> 35:48.894
Oh, it's okay.
Actually, I need the distraction.

35:48.977 --> 35:50.771
Let's talk Russia.

35:50.854 --> 35:55.692
I'm torn. Uh, we have this plane
circling over the North Sea...

35:56.652 --> 35:59.738
- and I don't know what to do.
- Well, what does your gut tell you?

35:59.821 --> 36:03.199
[sighs] I've never been
a gut sort of guy.

36:04.410 --> 36:07.078
I mean, if I had a gun to my head...

36:07.162 --> 36:11.291
- Sorry, that was a poor choice of words.
- It's fine. Go on.

36:13.460 --> 36:16.171
I understand what the president
hoped to achieve,

36:16.254 --> 36:18.882
but the thought of provoking Russia...

36:20.008 --> 36:24.220
And I'm just beginning to immerse myself
in all the complexities.

36:26.139 --> 36:29.309
What would Frank do,
if he were in my shoes right now?

36:29.393 --> 36:32.979
If he were here, he'd tell you that's
the last thing you should think about,

36:33.063 --> 36:34.981
because he's not here, you are.

36:35.065 --> 36:37.609
What would you do?

36:37.693 --> 36:40.153
Proceed with the mission
or bring him back?

36:41.530 --> 36:43.073
I don't like either.

36:44.240 --> 36:45.617
Those are my options.

36:45.701 --> 36:48.954
Well, if there's one thing I've learned,
28 years with Francis,

36:49.037 --> 36:51.206
and he said it time and time again,

36:51.289 --> 36:53.417
"If you don't like
the way the table is set..."

36:53.500 --> 36:56.086
- "Then turn over the table."
- That's right.

36:56.169 --> 36:58.254
He's said it to me,
more than once.

36:58.338 --> 37:00.591
Then that's what you should do, Donald.

37:02.175 --> 37:05.471
- But how?
- Well, let's figure it out.

37:09.641 --> 37:11.142
[Blythe sighs]

37:12.102 --> 37:14.187
[indistinct radio chatter]

37:19.818 --> 37:22.195
Weren't we supposed
to have landed already?

37:22.278 --> 37:25.866
- We're in a holding pattern.
- Why? Is something wrong?

37:25.949 --> 37:27.659
All I know is we're in a holding pattern.

37:52.684 --> 37:54.478
Doug.

37:54.561 --> 37:58.524
This plane's gonna run out of fuel soon.
We're gonna have to put it down somewhere.

38:14.998 --> 38:18.168
I'll be making a statement shortly.
Let's notify the press corps.

38:18.251 --> 38:21.922
- About the operation?
- No, to reassure the American people.

38:22.005 --> 38:24.800
- Shall I meet you in there?
- Ten minutes. The cabinet?

38:24.883 --> 38:27.093
- Still waiting on your decision, sir.
- Good.

38:27.177 --> 38:28.469
Let's go.

38:38.021 --> 38:40.481
I want you to land the plane in China.

38:40.566 --> 38:41.900
China, sir?

38:41.983 --> 38:44.402
There's no bailout without Chinese money.

38:44.485 --> 38:46.738
We give them Milkin,
they have more leverage.

38:46.822 --> 38:49.199
Sir, that gives away our leverage.

38:49.282 --> 38:51.076
I'm not for regime change,
but that just--

38:51.159 --> 38:53.494
It's the last thing
that Petrov is expecting.

38:53.579 --> 38:55.997
They'll demand drilling access
in eastern Siberia.

38:56.081 --> 38:58.792
And when they do,
we become the lesser of two evils.

38:58.875 --> 39:02.420
Sir, at no time did the president
intend on bringing China into the mix--

39:02.503 --> 39:04.255
Get the plane on Chinese soil.

39:04.339 --> 39:06.717
And turn over Milkin's assets.
That's my decision.

39:11.972 --> 39:14.725
- I asked for your help.
- And that's what I gave.

39:14.808 --> 39:16.685
No, China wasn't part
of the president's plan.

39:16.768 --> 39:19.020
It's part of the acting president's plan.

39:19.104 --> 39:21.982
- You ready?
- Yes, whenever you are.

39:22.065 --> 39:24.317
- Seth?
- Yes, sir.

39:35.161 --> 39:38.164
[Seth] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the acting president.</i>

39:42.836 --> 39:44.254
<i>Please, sit.</i>

39:46.006 --> 39:50.176
<i>This is a difficult day for all Americans,</i>

39:50.260 --> 39:55.140
<i>particularly for Mrs. Underwood,
who is gracious enough to be here,</i>

39:55.223 --> 39:59.310
