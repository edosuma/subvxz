04:08.240 --> 04:09.389
Whoa, there!

04:26.720 --> 04:27.755
Halt!

04:29.320 --> 04:30.548
Who goes there?

04:30.760 --> 04:34.594
lt is l, Arthur, Son of Uther Pendragon,
from the castle of Camelot.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.919
King of the Britons, defeater of the Saxons.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.630
Sovereign of all England!

04:42.000 --> 04:43.433
Pull the other one.

04:43.520 --> 04:46.637
l am, and this my trusty servant, Patsy.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.356
We have ridden the length of the land
in search of knights...

04:50.440 --> 04:55.195
...who will join me in my court at Camelot.
l must speak with your lord and master.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.791
-What? Ridden on a horse?
-Yes.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.151
-You're using coconuts!
-What?

05:00.360 --> 05:04.114
You've got two empty halves of coconut,
and you're banging them together.

05:04.200 --> 05:07.749
So? We have ridden since
the snows of winter covered this land.

05:08.440 --> 05:11.910
-Through the Kingdom of Mercia.
-Where did you get the coconuts?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.115
We found them.

05:13.200 --> 05:16.317
Found them? ln Mercia?
The coconut is tropical.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.314
-What do you mean?
-Well, this is a temperate zone.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.949
The swallow may fly south with the sun,
or the house martin or the plover...

05:23.040 --> 05:27.192
...may seek warmer climes in winter,
yet these are not strangers to our land.

05:28.160 --> 05:32.631
-Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
-Not at all. They could be carried.

05:32.960 --> 05:37.272
-What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
-lt could grip it by the husk.

05:37.880 --> 05:42.556
lt's not a question of where he grips it.
lt's a simple question of weight ratio.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.993
A 5-ounce bird could not carry
a 1-pound coconut.

05:47.080 --> 05:51.790
lt doesn't matter. Go tell your master
that Arthur from Camelot is here.

05:53.240 --> 05:56.232
ln order to maintain air-speed velocity...

05:56.480 --> 06:00.712
...a swallow needs to beat its wings
43 times every second, right?

06:01.040 --> 06:02.871
-Please!
-Am l right?

06:03.640 --> 06:07.633
-l'm not interested.
-lt could be carried by an African swallow.

06:08.360 --> 06:12.831
Oh, yes! An African swallow, maybe.
Not a European swallow. That's my point.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.148
l agree with that.

06:14.240 --> 06:18.153
Will you ask your master
if he wants to join my court at Camelot?

06:19.280 --> 06:22.238
But then, of course,
African swallows are non-migratory.

06:22.320 --> 06:25.392
-Oh, yes.
-They couldn't bring a coconut, anyway.

06:26.040 --> 06:29.476
Wait a minute! Supposing two swallows
carried it together?

06:29.880 --> 06:34.351
-No, they'd have to have it on a line.
-Simple. They'd use a strand of creeper.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.912
-Held under the dorsal guiding feathers?
-Why not?

06:40.080 --> 06:41.559
Bring out your dead!

07:12.160 --> 07:13.195
Ninepence.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.270
-Bring out your dead.
-Here's one.

07:34.600 --> 07:35.510
Ninepence.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.158
-l'm not dead!
-What?

07:37.240 --> 07:39.800
-Nothing. There's your ninepence.
-l'm not dead!

07:39.880 --> 07:42.030
-He says he's not dead.
-Yes, he is.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.553
-l'm not!
-He isn't.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.108
-He will be soon. He's very ill.
-l'm getting better!

07:46.200 --> 07:47.872
You'll be stone dead in a moment.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.520
l can't take him like that.
lt's against regulations.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.797
-l don't want to go on the cart.
-Don't be such a baby.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.950
-l can't take him.
-l feel fine.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.996
-Well, do us a favour.
-l can't.

07:58.080 --> 08:00.594
Can you hang around a few minutes?
He won't be long.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.274
Got to go to the Robinsons'.
They've lost nine today.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.078
-When's your next round?
-Thursday.

08:05.160 --> 08:08.755
-l think l'll go for a walk.
-You're not fooling anyone, you know.

08:08.840 --> 08:13.675
-lsn't there something you can do?
-l feel happy.

08:14.920 --> 08:17.753
-Thanks very much.
-Not at all. See you on Thursday.

08:17.840 --> 08:18.875
Right.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.478
-Who's that, then?
-l don't know. Must be a king.

08:25.760 --> 08:28.228
-Why?
-He hasn't got shit all over him.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.473
-Old woman!
-Man!

08:53.120 --> 08:56.396
Man. Sorry.
What knight lives in that castle over there?

08:56.520 --> 08:58.431
-l'm 37.
-What?

08:58.960 --> 09:02.635
-l'm 37. l'm not old.
-l can't just call you ''man.''

09:02.720 --> 09:05.598
-You could say, ''Dennis.''
-l didn't know you were a Dennis.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.272
You didn't bother to find out.

09:07.360 --> 09:09.999
l did say sorry about the ''old woman,''
but from behind--

09:10.080 --> 09:13.231
What l object to
is that you treat me like an inferior.

09:13.320 --> 09:16.073
-Well, l am king.
-King? Very nice.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.359
How did you get that?
By exploiting the workers!

09:19.760 --> 09:23.036
By hanging on to outdated
imperialist dogma which perpetuates...

09:23.120 --> 09:25.998
...the economic and social differences
in our society!

09:26.080 --> 09:30.392
-lf there's ever going to be any progress--
-There's some lovely filth down here.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.549
How do you do?

09:32.640 --> 09:35.518
How do you do, good lady?
l am Arthur, King of the Britons.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.909
-Whose castle is that?
-King of the who?

09:38.040 --> 09:40.110
-The Britons.
-Who are the Britons?

09:40.320 --> 09:43.198
We all are. We're all Britons.
And l am your king.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.952
Didn't know we had a king.
We're an autonomous collective.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.793
You're fooling yourself.
We're living in a dictatorship.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.838
A self-perpetuating autocracy
in which the working class--

09:52.920 --> 09:55.275
There you go. Bringing class into it again.

09:55.360 --> 09:59.672
-That's what it's all about. lf only people--
-Please, good people. l am in haste.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.553
Who lives in that castle?

10:02.480 --> 10:04.436
-No one lives there.
-Who is your lord?

10:04.520 --> 10:06.317
-We don't have a lord.
-What?

10:06.480 --> 10:09.278
l told you.
We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.

10:09.680 --> 10:12.990
We take turns to act as
a sort of executive officer for the week.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.514
-Yes.
-But all the decisions of that officer...

10:15.600 --> 10:18.512
-...are ratified at a biweekly meeting.
-Yes, l see.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.751
-By majority in the case of internal affairs.
-Be quiet!

10:21.840 --> 10:26.072
-By a two-thirds majority in the case of--
-Be quiet! l order you to be quiet.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.471
''Order.'' Who does he think he is?

10:28.600 --> 10:31.068
-l am your king!
-l didn't vote for you.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.517
-You don't vote for kings.
-How did you become king then?

10:35.120 --> 10:39.511
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad
in the purest shimmering samite...

10:39.880 --> 10:42.872
...held aloft Excalibur
from the bosom of the water...

10:43.480 --> 10:48.156
...signifying, by divine providence,
that l, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.119
That is why l'm your king!

10:50.200 --> 10:54.512
Listen. Strange women lying in ponds,
distributing swords, is no basis...

10:54.600 --> 10:57.751
...for a system of government.
Supreme executive power...

10:57.840 --> 11:02.231
...derives from a mandate from the masses.
Not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.230
Be quiet!

11:03.320 --> 11:06.437
You can't expect to wield
supreme executive power...

11:06.520 --> 11:08.988
...'cause some watery tart
threw a sword at you.

11:09.080 --> 11:12.197
-Shut up!
-lf l went around saying l was an emperor...

11:12.280 --> 11:16.353
...because some moistened bint had lobbed
a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!

11:16.440 --> 11:20.399
-Will you shut up?
-See the violence inherent in the system.

11:20.560 --> 11:23.996
-Shut up!
-See the violence inherent in the system!

11:24.160 --> 11:27.038
-Help, l'm being repressed!
-Bloody peasant!

11:27.120 --> 11:29.429
What a give away. Did you hear that?

11:29.520 --> 11:32.193
That's what l'm on about.
Did you see him repressing me?

13:05.320 --> 13:08.232
You fight with the strength of many men,
Sir Knight.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.350
l am Arthur, King of the Britons.

13:17.520 --> 13:21.832
l seek the finest and bravest knights
in the land to join me in Camelot.

13:27.080 --> 13:30.277
You have proved yourself worthy.
Will you join me?

13:35.680 --> 13:38.638
You make me sad. So be it. Come, Patsy.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.552
None shall pass.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.911
-What?
-None shall pass.

13:43.560 --> 13:47.155
l have no quarrel with you, good
Sir Knight, but l must cross this bridge.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.356
Then you shall die.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.988
l command you, as King of the Britons,
to stand aside.

13:54.280 --> 13:57.716
l move for no man.

13:59.440 --> 14:00.589
So be it!

14:26.240 --> 14:28.231
Now, stand aside, worthy adversary.

14:28.320 --> 14:31.392
-'Tis but a scratch.
-''A scratch''? Your arm's off.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.795
-No, it isn't.
-Well, what's that, then?

14:34.840 --> 14:36.239
-l've had worse.
-You liar.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.878
Come on, you pansy!

14:45.600 --> 14:46.919
Victory is mine.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.750
We thank thee, Lord, that in thy--

14:52.000 --> 14:53.513
-Come on, then.
-What?

14:53.840 --> 14:54.989
Have at you.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.995
You are brave, Sir Knight,
but the fight is mine.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.433
Had enough, eh?

15:01.520 --> 15:04.034
Look, you stupid bastard.
You've got no arms left.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.519
-Yes, l have.
-Look!

15:05.920 --> 15:07.353
Just a flesh wound.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.709
-Look, stop that.
-Chicken!

15:10.800 --> 15:12.995
l'll have your leg. Right!

15:15.920 --> 15:18.195
-Right! l'll do you for that.
-You'll what?

15:18.280 --> 15:21.078
-Come here.
-What are you going to do? Bleed on me?

15:21.160 --> 15:23.799
-l am invincible!
-You're a loony.

15:24.520 --> 15:28.035
The Black Knight always triumphs.
Have at you!

15:29.040 --> 15:30.234
Come on, then.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.271
All right, we'll call it a draw.

15:38.160 --> 15:40.469
-Come, Patsy.
-Oh, l see.

15:41.040 --> 15:44.396
Running away? You yellow bastard!

15:44.520 --> 15:48.433
Come back here and take what's coming
to you! l'll bite your legs off!

15:52.040 --> 15:55.828
''Pie Jesu Domine

15:56.440 --> 16:00.638
''Dona eis requiem

16:03.040 --> 16:06.669
''Pie Jesu Domine

16:08.240 --> 16:13.030
''Dona eis requiem''

16:24.760 --> 16:26.591
-A witch!
-We found a witch.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.750
-We got a witch.
-We found a witch.

16:33.480 --> 16:34.879
We've got a witch.

16:36.240 --> 16:38.151
Burn her!

16:46.440 --> 16:49.955
-We have found a witch. May we burn her?
-Burn her!

16:51.560 --> 16:54.518
-How do you know she is a witch?
-She looks like one.

16:56.480 --> 16:57.879
Bring her forward.

16:58.640 --> 17:02.872
-l am not a witch.
-But you are dressed as one.

17:03.240 --> 17:05.913
-They dressed me up like this.
-We didn't!

17:06.000 --> 17:08.036
And this isn't my nose. lt's a false one.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.036
-Well?
-Well, we did do the nose.

17:14.839 --> 17:17.593
-The nose?
-And the hat. But she is a witch.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.758
Burn her!

17:21.680 --> 17:25.593
-Did you dress her up like this?
-No. Yes.

17:25.880 --> 17:29.111
Yes, a bit. She has got a wart.

17:30.600 --> 17:34.434
-What makes you think she is a witch?
-Well, she turned me into a newt.

17:35.840 --> 17:36.909
A newt?

17:41.040 --> 17:42.234
l got better.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.040
-Burn her anyway.
-Burn her!

17:48.600 --> 17:53.276
Quiet! There are ways of telling
whether she is a witch.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.231
-Are there? What are they? Tell us.
-Do they hurt?

17:57.680 --> 18:00.478
Tell me: What do you do with witches?

18:00.640 --> 18:02.915
Burn them!

18:03.960 --> 18:07.555
-What do you burn apart from witches?
-More witches!

18:08.840 --> 18:12.196
-Wood.
-So, why do witches burn?

18:23.200 --> 18:25.634
-'Cause they're made of wood?
-Good.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.950
So, how do we tell
whether she is made of wood?

18:32.040 --> 18:36.556
-Build a bridge out of her.
-Can you not also make bridges of stone?

18:37.760 --> 18:38.749
Oh, yeah.

18:39.840 --> 18:42.115
Does wood sink in water?

18:42.440 --> 18:44.795
-No.
-lt floats.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.518
Throw her into the pond!

18:49.440 --> 18:52.398
-What also floats in water?
-Bread.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.197
-Apples.
-Very small rocks.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.200
-Cider. Gravy. Cherries.
-Nuts.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.358
-Churches.
-Lead.

19:00.560 --> 19:01.549
A duck!

19:03.840 --> 19:04.829
Exactly.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.158
So, logically....

19:08.640 --> 19:10.198
lf she...

19:11.040 --> 19:13.235
...weighs the same as a duck...

19:15.600 --> 19:17.113
...she's made of wood.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.599
And, therefore....

19:20.720 --> 19:22.119
-A witch!
-A witch!

19:26.640 --> 19:28.756
We shall use my largest scales.

19:48.200 --> 19:51.636
Right. Remove the supports!

19:58.640 --> 20:00.358
-lt's a fair cop.
-Burn her!

20:08.120 --> 20:11.157
Who are you,
who are so wise in the ways of science?

20:11.320 --> 20:14.471
-l am Arthur, King of the Britons.
-My liege.

20:15.800 --> 20:20.555
Good Sir Knight, will you come to Camelot,
and join us at the Round Table?

20:21.120 --> 20:23.111
My liege, l would be honoured.

20:23.720 --> 20:26.188
-What is your name?
-Bedevere, my liege.

20:26.640 --> 20:29.234
Then l dub you, Sir Bedevere...

20:30.080 --> 20:31.911
...knight of the Round Table.

20:33.160 --> 20:36.755
The wise Sir Bedevere was the first
to join King Arthur's knights.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.793
But other illustrious names
were soon to follow.

20:40.320 --> 20:42.038
Sir Lancelot the Brave.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.638
Sir Galahad the Pure.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.278
And Sir Robin,
the Not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot...

20:48.360 --> 20:50.510
...who had nearly fought
the Dragon of Angnor...

20:50.600 --> 20:53.558
...who nearly stood up to
the vicious Chicken of Bristol...

20:53.640 --> 20:57.235
...and who had personally wet himself
at the Battle of Badon Hill.

20:57.480 --> 21:00.790
And the aptly named
Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.798
Together they formed a band...

21:03.880 --> 21:07.555
...whose names and deeds
were to be retold throughout the centuries.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.910
The Knights of the Round Table.

21:10.640 --> 21:13.916
That, my liege, is how we know
the Earth to be banana-shaped.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.355
This new learning amazes me,
Sir Bedevere.

21:16.440 --> 21:20.115
Explain again how sheep's bladders
may be employed to prevent earthquakes.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.918
-Certainly, sir.
-Look, my liege.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.752
-Camelot.
-Camelot.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.871
-Camelot.
-lt's only a model.

21:31.560 --> 21:34.074
Knights, l bid you welcome
to your new home.

21:34.280 --> 21:36.714
Let us ride to Camelot!

21:38.480 --> 21:41.631
''We're knights of the Round Table
We dance whene'er we're able

21:41.720 --> 21:44.678
''We do routines and chorus scenes
With footwork impeccable

21:44.760 --> 21:47.718
''We dine well here in Camelot
We eat ham and jam and Spam a lot

21:54.480 --> 21:58.473
''We're knights of the Round Table
Our shows are formidable

21:59.160 --> 22:00.878
''But many times
We're given rhymes

22:00.960 --> 22:03.713
''That are quite unsingable
We're opera mad in Camelot

22:03.800 --> 22:05.870
''We sing from the diaphragm a lot

22:20.880 --> 22:24.400
''ln war we're tough and able

22:24.640 --> 22:25.993
''Quite indefatigable

22:26.360 --> 22:28.157
''Between our quests
We sequin vests

22:28.240 --> 22:31.312
''And impersonate Clark Gable
lt's a busy life in Camelot

22:31.680 --> 22:35.559
''l have to push the pram a lot''

22:40.240 --> 22:43.596
No, on second thoughts,
let's not go to Camelot. lt is a silly place.

22:43.680 --> 22:44.874
Right.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.871
Arthur.

22:57.320 --> 22:58.719
King of the Britons.

23:00.480 --> 23:04.075
Don't grovel. If there's one thing
I can't stand, it's people grovelling.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.798
-Sorry.
-And don't apologize.

23:06.240 --> 23:09.676
Every time I talk to someone it's
''sorry this,'' and, ''forgive me that''...

23:09.760 --> 23:11.318
...and, ''I'm not worthy.''

23:11.480 --> 23:14.074
-What are you doing now?
-l'm averting my eyes, O Lord.

23:14.160 --> 23:18.517
Don't. It's like those miserable psalms.
They're so depressing.

23:18.720 --> 23:20.392
-Now, knock it off!
-Yes, Lord.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.836
Right. Arthur, King of the Britons.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.914
Your knights of the Round Table
shall have a task...

23:27.000 --> 23:29.594
...to make them an example
in these dark times.

23:29.680 --> 23:32.274
-Good idea, O Lord!
-'Course it's a good idea.

23:32.960 --> 23:36.509
Behold, Arthur, this is the Holy Grail.

23:36.760 --> 23:41.197
Look well, Arthur,
for it is your sacred task to seek this grail.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.750
That is your purpose, Arthur.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.279
The quest for the Holy Grail.

23:51.280 --> 23:54.590
-A blessing from the Lord.
-God be praised!

24:51.160 --> 24:52.195
Halt!

25:02.720 --> 25:03.755
Hello!

25:11.040 --> 25:12.109
Hello!

25:13.760 --> 25:15.239
Hello. Who is it?

25:15.560 --> 25:18.996
lt is King Arthur, and these are
my knights of the Round Table.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.633
Whose castle is this?

25:20.840 --> 25:23.991
This is the castle of my master,
Guy de Loimbard.

25:24.280 --> 25:27.829
Go and tell your master
that we have been charged by God...

25:28.400 --> 25:32.678
...with a sacred quest. lf he will give us
food and shelter for the night...

25:33.080 --> 25:35.833
...he can join us in our quest
for the Holy Grail.

25:36.160 --> 25:39.197
Well, l'll ask him,
but l don't think he'll be very keen.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.271
He's already got one, you see.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.755
-What?
-He says they've already got one!

25:46.120 --> 25:49.715
-Are you sure he's got one?
-Oh, yes. lt's very nice.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.630
l told him we've already got one.

25:55.680 --> 25:59.798
-Can we come up, and have a look?
-Of course not! You are English-types.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.555
-Well, what are you then?
-l'm French.

26:03.640 --> 26:07.428
Why do you think l have
this outrageous accent, you silly king?

26:07.920 --> 26:10.992
-What are you doing in England?
-Mind your own business.

26:12.560 --> 26:16.189
lf you will not show us the Grail,
we shall take your castle by force.

26:16.280 --> 26:19.317
You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!

26:19.880 --> 26:23.668
Go and boil your bottoms,
sons of a silly person.

26:23.960 --> 26:27.669
l blow my nose at you,
so-called Arthur King.

26:27.880 --> 26:31.793
You and all your silly English knights.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.631
-What a strange person.
-Now look here, my good man--

26:41.720 --> 26:43.995
l don't want to talk to you no more...

26:44.280 --> 26:47.397
...you empty-headed,
animal food-trough wiper.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.394
l fart in your general direction.

26:50.880 --> 26:55.556
Your mother was a hamster,
and your father smelt of elderberries.

26:57.720 --> 27:00.280
ls there someone else up there
we could talk to?

27:00.360 --> 27:04.114
No. Now go away,
or l shall taunt you a second time.

27:06.400 --> 27:09.915
Now, this is your last chance.
l've been more than reasonable....

27:10.040 --> 27:11.393
-Fetchez la vache!
-Quoi?

27:11.480 --> 27:12.276
Fetchez la vache!

27:15.160 --> 27:18.118
lf you do not agree to my commands,
then l shall--

27:19.920 --> 27:21.148
Jesus Christ!

27:26.040 --> 27:28.235
Right! Charge!

27:42.280 --> 27:44.748
Run away! Run away!

27:54.880 --> 27:57.075
-Fiends! l'll tear them apart.
-No, no.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.993
Sir, l have a plan, sir.

29:31.600 --> 29:32.589
-Un cadeau.
-What?

29:32.680 --> 29:33.669
-A present.
-Un cadeau.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.751
Oui, allons-y. Let's go.

29:59.200 --> 30:00.315
What happens now?

30:00.400 --> 30:05.269
Well, now, Lancelot, Galahad,
and l wait until nightfall...

30:05.520 --> 30:09.513
...and then leap out of the rabbit,
taking the French by surprise.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.514
Not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!

30:13.480 --> 30:14.674
Who leaps out?

30:15.160 --> 30:17.674
Lancelot, Galahad, and l...

30:19.000 --> 30:20.718
...leap out of the rabbit.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.352
Look. lf we built this large,
wooden badger....

30:33.200 --> 30:35.475
Run away!

30:44.840 --> 30:47.308
-History for Schools. Take 8.
-Action!

30:47.720 --> 30:51.395
Defeat at the castle seems to have
utterly disheartened King Arthur.

30:51.720 --> 30:55.110
The ferocity of the French taunting
took him completely by surprise.

30:56.440 --> 31:00.513
Arthur became convinced
that a new strategy was required...

31:00.680 --> 31:04.912
...if the quest for the Holy Grail were
to be brought to a successful conclusion.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.719
Arthur, having consulted
his closest knights...

31:08.120 --> 31:12.193
...decided that they should separate,
and search for the Grail individually.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.352
Now, this is what they did--

31:17.520 --> 31:18.509
Frank!

31:26.400 --> 31:28.675
The tale of Sir Robin.

31:29.720 --> 31:32.473
So, each of the knights
went their separate ways.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.877
Sir Robin rode north,
through the dark forest of Ewing...

31:36.120 --> 31:38.554
...accompanied by his favourite minstrels.

31:39.760 --> 31:43.309
''Bravely bold Sir Robin
Rode forth from Camelot

31:44.040 --> 31:47.953
''He was not afraid to die
O, Brave Sir Robin

31:48.320 --> 31:52.074
''He was not at all afraid
To be killed in nasty ways

31:52.520 --> 31:55.114
''Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin

31:56.760 --> 32:00.355
''He was not in the least bit scared
To be mashed into a pulp

32:01.040 --> 32:05.113
''Or to have his eyes gouged out
And his elbows broken

32:05.320 --> 32:09.074
''To have his kneecaps split
And his body burned away

32:09.360 --> 32:12.432
''And his limbs all hacked and mangled
Brave Sir Robin

32:13.840 --> 32:15.831
''His head smashed in
And his heart cut out

32:15.920 --> 32:17.751
''His liver removed
And his bowels unplugged

32:17.840 --> 32:20.673
''His nostrils raped, his bottom burned off
And his penis--''

32:20.760 --> 32:23.558
That's enough music for now, lads.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.157
Looks like there's dirty work afoot.

32:28.760 --> 32:31.513
Anarcho-syndicalism
is a way of preserving freedom.

32:31.600 --> 32:34.910
Dennis, forget about freedom.
Don't drop that mud.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.515
Halt! Who art thou?

32:40.800 --> 32:43.997
-''He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin--''
-Shut up!

32:45.520 --> 32:48.717
Nobody, really. l was just passing through.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.194
What do you want?

32:50.280 --> 32:52.555
-''To fight and--''
-Shut up!

32:53.840 --> 32:55.558
Nothing. Nothing, really.

32:56.480 --> 32:59.631
-Just to pass through, good Sir Knight.
-I'm afraid not.

33:01.520 --> 33:06.196
-Actually, l am a knight of the Round Table.
-You're a knight of the Round Table?

33:06.680 --> 33:07.556
l am.

33:07.640 --> 33:09.790
-In that case, I have to kill you.
-Shall I?

33:09.880 --> 33:11.996
-I don't think so.
-What do I think?

33:12.080 --> 33:13.832
-Kill him.
-Let's be nice to him.

33:13.920 --> 33:14.989
-Shut up.
-But--

33:15.080 --> 33:15.796
And you!

33:15.880 --> 33:18.030
Get the sword out.
I want to cut his head off!

33:18.120 --> 33:20.839
-Cut your own head off.
-Yes, do us all a favour.

33:20.920 --> 33:22.876
-What?
-Yapping on all the time.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.599
-You're lucky you're not next to him.
-What do you mean?

33:25.680 --> 33:27.636
-You snore.
-I don't.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.877
-You've got bad breath.
-Only because you don't brush my teeth.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.235
Stop bitching, and let's go and have tea!

33:33.320 --> 33:37.279
All right! We'll kill him first,
and then have tea and biscuits.

33:37.360 --> 33:38.634
-Yes.
-Not biscuits.

33:38.720 --> 33:42.030
All right! Not biscuits.
But let's kill him anyway.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.155
Right.

33:45.640 --> 33:47.870
-He's buggered off!
-So he has! He's scarpered.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.269
-''Brave Sir Robin ran away''
-No!

33:50.360 --> 33:53.238
-''Bravely ran away, away''
-l didn't.

33:54.120 --> 33:57.874
''When danger reared its ugly head
He bravely turned his tail and fled

33:57.960 --> 34:01.669
''Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about
And gallantly he chickened out

34:02.040 --> 34:05.715
''Bravely taking to his feet
He beat a very brave retreat

34:05.920 --> 34:08.672
-''Bravest of the brave, Sir Robin''
-l never!

34:11.000 --> 34:14.788
''Pie Jesu Domine

34:15.360 --> 34:19.638
''Dona eis requiem''

34:38.360 --> 34:40.590
The tale of Sir Galahad.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.991
Open the door.

35:37.120 --> 35:40.112
ln the name of King Arthur, open the door!

35:48.800 --> 35:49.710
Hello!

35:50.320 --> 35:53.915
Welcome, gentle Sir Knight.
Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.

35:55.120 --> 35:57.395
-The Castle Anthrax?
-Yes.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.356
lt's not a very good name, is it?

36:00.440 --> 36:04.797
But we are nice, and we will attend
to your every, every need!

36:05.680 --> 36:07.955
You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?

36:08.080 --> 36:10.355
-The what?
-The Grail. lt is here?

36:11.320 --> 36:14.153
But you are tired,
and you must rest awhile.

36:14.640 --> 36:15.993
Midget! Crapper!

36:16.280 --> 36:19.192
-Yes, O Zoot?
-Prepare a bed for our guest.

36:19.640 --> 36:22.108
-Thank you, Zoot.
-Thank you.

36:22.240 --> 36:23.832
Away, away, varletesses!

36:25.520 --> 36:29.479
The beds here are warm and soft,
and very, very big.

36:29.960 --> 36:32.599
-Look, l--
-What is your name, handsome knight?

36:32.920 --> 36:34.911
Sir Galahad the Chaste.

36:36.080 --> 36:38.913
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot.

36:39.800 --> 36:43.554
-But come.
-Please, in God's name, show me the Grail.

36:44.760 --> 36:47.593
You have suffered much. You are delirious.

36:47.680 --> 36:50.319
-Look, l have seen it. lt is here.
-Sir Galahad!

36:50.400 --> 36:54.188
You would not be so ungallant
as to refuse our hospitality.

36:57.120 --> 37:02.240
l'm afraid our life must seem very dull
and quiet, compared to yours.

37:02.960 --> 37:07.750
We're 8 score blondes and brunettes,
all between 16 and 19 and a half...

37:08.200 --> 37:11.158
...cut off in this castle,
with no one to protect us.

37:12.240 --> 37:13.719
lt is a lonely life.

37:14.440 --> 37:19.309
Bathing, dressing, undressing,
making exciting underwear.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.194
We are just not used to handsome knights.

37:23.520 --> 37:25.988
Nay. Come. You may lie here.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.389
-But you are wounded!
-No, it's nothing!

37:30.680 --> 37:35.674
You must see the doctors immediately.
Please, lie down.

37:38.320 --> 37:41.835
-Well, what seems to be the trouble?
-They're doctors?

37:43.040 --> 37:45.156
They have a basic medical training.

37:45.560 --> 37:48.120
Come, come, you must try to rest.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.758
Dr. Piglet! Dr. Winston! Practice your art.

37:58.920 --> 38:01.639
-Try to relax.
-Are you sure that's absolutely necessary?

38:02.080 --> 38:03.513
We must examine you.

38:06.360 --> 38:09.591
-There's nothing wrong with that.
-Please. We are doctors.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.433
Look, this cannot be.

38:13.960 --> 38:16.155
-l am sworn to chastity!
-Back to your bed!

38:16.240 --> 38:18.913
Torment me no longer.
l have seen the Grail.

38:19.240 --> 38:21.959
-There's no Grail here.
-l have seen it.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.479
-l have seen--
-Hello.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.268
Hello.

38:50.200 --> 38:53.795
-Zoot!
-l am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo.

38:55.120 --> 38:57.554
-Where are you going?
-l seek the Grail.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.796
l have seen it here in this castle!

39:00.840 --> 39:05.038
Oh, no. Bad, bad Zoot!

39:05.360 --> 39:08.557
-What is it?
-Wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!

39:09.040 --> 39:13.079
She has been setting light to our beacon,
which is Grail-shaped.

39:13.480 --> 39:15.710
lt's not the first time
we've had this problem.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.438
lt's not the real Grail?

39:17.720 --> 39:20.518
Wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot.

39:20.640 --> 39:23.837
She is a bad person,
and must pay the penalty.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.630
Do you think this scene
should have been cut?

39:27.720 --> 39:30.473
We were so worried
when the boys were writing it.

39:30.560 --> 39:33.757
But now we're glad. lt's better
than some previous scenes, l think.

39:34.120 --> 39:35.553
Ours was better visually.

39:35.640 --> 39:38.279
Ours was committed.
lt wasn't a string of pussy jokes.

39:38.360 --> 39:40.794
-Get on with it.
-Yes. Get on with it!

39:40.880 --> 39:43.394
Get on with it!

39:43.960 --> 39:47.555
-l am enjoying this scene.
-Get on with it!

39:51.640 --> 39:53.119
Wicked, wicked Zoot!

39:55.280 --> 39:56.952
She must pay the penalty.

39:57.160 --> 40:01.756
ln Castle Anthrax, we have a punishment
for setting alight the Grail-shaped beacon.

40:02.360 --> 40:05.158
You must tie her down on a bed,
and spank her.

40:05.360 --> 40:07.396
A spanking! A spanking!

40:07.560 --> 40:11.314
You must spank her, and after you've
spanked her, deal with her as you like.

40:11.400 --> 40:13.595
-And, then, spank me.
-And me!

40:13.680 --> 40:14.749
-And me.
-And me.

40:14.840 --> 40:17.229
Yes. You must give us all
a good spanking!

40:17.320 --> 40:18.799
A spanking!

40:20.640 --> 40:25.794
-And, after the spanking, the oral sex.
-The oral sex!

40:26.560 --> 40:28.551
Well, l could stay a bit longer.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.716
-Sir Galahad!
-Hello.

40:30.800 --> 40:33.109
-Quick! You are in great peril.
-Why?

40:33.200 --> 40:35.430
-No, he isn't!
-Silence, foul temptress!

40:35.520 --> 40:37.715
-She's got a point.
-We'll cover your escape!

40:37.800 --> 40:40.439
-Look, l'm fine!
-Wait, Sir Galahad!

40:40.520 --> 40:44.593
-l can tackle this lot single-handed!
-Yes, let him tackle us single-handed!

40:45.600 --> 40:46.999
No, Sir Galahad. Come!

40:47.080 --> 40:49.310
Honestly, l can handle this lot easily!

40:49.400 --> 40:51.914
-Yes, let him handle us easily.
-No, sir. Quick!

40:52.000 --> 40:55.310
Wait! Please! l can defeat them!
There's only 150 of them!

40:55.640 --> 40:58.313
He'll beat us easily. We haven't a chance.

41:02.280 --> 41:03.474
Oh, shit!

41:03.840 --> 41:06.479
-You were in great peril.
-l don't think l was.

41:06.560 --> 41:07.993
You were in terrible peril.

41:08.080 --> 41:11.117
-Let me go back, and face the peril.
-No, it's too perilous.

41:11.240 --> 41:13.435
lt's my duty to sample as much peril
as l can.

41:13.520 --> 41:15.192
We've got to find the Holy Grail.

41:15.280 --> 41:17.919
-Let me have just a bit of peril?
-No. lt's unhealthy.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.956
-l bet you're gay.
-No, l'm not.

41:21.440 --> 41:25.035
Sir Lancelot had saved Sir Galahad
from almost certain temptation.

41:25.320 --> 41:27.754
But, they were still no nearer the Grail.

41:28.040 --> 41:31.555
King Arthur and Sir Bedevere,
not more than a swallow's flight away...

41:31.640 --> 41:33.471
...had discovered something.

41:34.480 --> 41:36.914
That's an unladen swallow's flight,
obviously.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.355
They were more than
two laden swallow's flights away.

41:39.440 --> 41:41.590
Four, with a coconut
on a line between them.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.238
If the birds were--

41:43.320 --> 41:45.151
Get on with it!

41:45.240 --> 41:46.195
Oh, anyway...

41:46.280 --> 41:49.636
...on to Scene 24, which is a smashing
scene, with some lovely acting...

41:49.720 --> 41:51.790
...in which Arthur discovers a vital clue.

41:51.880 --> 41:54.678
There aren't any swallows,
but I think you can hear a--

41:56.520 --> 42:00.195
And this enchanter of whom you speak,
he has seen the Grail?

42:05.200 --> 42:06.633
Where does he live?

42:06.840 --> 42:08.353
Old man, where does he live?

42:09.640 --> 42:14.316
He knows of a cave.
A cave which no man has entered.

42:14.720 --> 42:18.156
-And the Grail. The Grail is there?
-There is much danger.

42:18.720 --> 42:22.633
For beyond the cave
lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril...

42:23.160 --> 42:25.469
...which no man has ever crossed.

42:25.920 --> 42:28.229
But the Grail. Where is the Grail?

42:28.880 --> 42:31.758
Seek you the Bridge of Death.

42:33.400 --> 42:35.994
The Bridge of Death?
Which leads to the Grail?

43:19.400 --> 43:24.155
-Who are you?
-We are the knights who say, ''Ni''!

43:24.320 --> 43:26.754
-No! Not the knights who say ''Ni''?
-The same!

43:26.840 --> 43:30.435
-Who are they?
-We are the keepers of the sacred words.

43:30.960 --> 43:34.157
''Ni,'' ''Peng,'' and ''Neee Wom''!

43:34.960 --> 43:37.349
Those who hear them
seldom live to tell the tale.

43:37.440 --> 43:41.638
The knights who say, ''Ni''
demand a sacrifice.

43:41.720 --> 43:44.154
Knights of Ni,
we are but simple travellers...

43:44.240 --> 43:46.834
...who seek the enchanter
who lives beyond these woods.

43:46.920 --> 43:48.035
Ni! Ni!

43:53.760 --> 43:58.117
We shall say, ''Ni'' again to you,
if you do not appease us.

43:58.720 --> 44:01.712
-What is it you want?
-We want...

44:02.840 --> 44:04.512
...a shrubbery.

44:05.360 --> 44:06.349
A what?

44:06.440 --> 44:10.399
-Ni! Ni!
-Please! No more!

44:10.480 --> 44:14.075
-We will find you a shrubbery.
-You must return with a shrubbery...

44:14.160 --> 44:17.391
...or else you will never pass
through this wood...

44:17.880 --> 44:19.233
...alive.

44:19.520 --> 44:21.829
Knights of Ni, you are just and fair.

44:21.920 --> 44:24.673
-We will return with a shrubbery.
-One that looks nice.

44:24.760 --> 44:26.637
-Of course.
-And not too expensive.

44:26.720 --> 44:29.871
-Yes.
-Now go!

45:11.920 --> 45:14.115
Stop that! Stop that!

45:14.280 --> 45:16.999
Go on, be off! Go away.

45:20.040 --> 45:21.393
And you, be off!

45:26.680 --> 45:27.669
Bloody weather.

45:28.240 --> 45:30.071
The tale of Sir Lancelot.

45:36.560 --> 45:39.358
One day, lad, all this will be yours.

45:39.480 --> 45:41.869
-What, the curtains?
-No, not the curtains.

45:41.960 --> 45:46.238
All that you can see,
stretched out over the hills and valleys.

45:46.320 --> 45:48.072
That'll be your kingdom, lad.

45:48.160 --> 45:49.832
-But, Mother.
-Father, lad.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.470
-But, Father, l don't want any of that.
-Listen, lad.

45:53.600 --> 45:58.435
l built this kingdom up from nothing.
When l started here, it was a swamp.

45:58.760 --> 46:01.672
Other kings said l was daft
to build a castle on the swamp.

46:01.760 --> 46:04.752
But l built it all the same to show them.

46:05.240 --> 46:06.958
lt sank into the swamp.

46:07.040 --> 46:09.759
So, l built a second one.
That sank into the swamp.

46:09.840 --> 46:13.515
So, l built a third one. That burned down,
fell over, then sank in the swamp.

46:13.600 --> 46:15.511
But the fourth one stayed up.

46:16.320 --> 46:18.311
And that's what you'll get, lad.

46:18.440 --> 46:22.956
-The strongest castle in these isles.
-But l don't want any of that.

46:23.520 --> 46:25.238
-l'd rather--
-Rather what?

46:25.440 --> 46:27.078
l'd rather just...

46:28.440 --> 46:31.193
-...sing.
-Stop that.

46:31.280 --> 46:33.953
You're not going into a song
while l'm here!

46:34.040 --> 46:36.270
ln 20 minutes, you're marrying a girl...

46:36.360 --> 46:40.194
...whose father owns
the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.

46:40.320 --> 46:42.959
-But l don't want land.
-Listen, Alice.

46:43.040 --> 46:44.598
-Herbert.
-Herbert.

46:44.680 --> 46:47.911
We live on a bloody swamp,
we need all the land we can get.

46:48.480 --> 46:51.199
-But l don't like her.
-Don't like her?

46:51.960 --> 46:53.359
What's wrong with her?

46:53.440 --> 46:57.558
She's beautiful, she's rich.
She's got huge...

46:58.240 --> 46:59.593
...tracts of land.

47:00.480 --> 47:05.474
l know, but l want the girl
that l marry to have...

47:06.240 --> 47:09.550
...a certain special something.

47:10.320 --> 47:12.470
Cut that out!

47:13.800 --> 47:18.112
You're marrying Princess Lucky,
so you'd better get used to the idea!

47:19.400 --> 47:20.389
Guards!

47:20.840 --> 47:23.957
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave
the room until l get him.

47:24.040 --> 47:26.873
Not to leave the room,
even if you come and get him.

47:26.960 --> 47:28.916
No. Until l come and get him.

47:29.240 --> 47:32.312
Until you come and get him,
we're not to enter the room.

47:32.440 --> 47:37.070
No, you stay in the room
and make sure he doesn't leave.

47:37.360 --> 47:39.749
-And you'll come and get him.
-Right.

47:39.840 --> 47:43.355
We don't need to do anything,
apart from stop him entering the room.

47:43.640 --> 47:46.632
-No. Leaving the room.
-Leaving the room, yes.

47:46.920 --> 47:48.876
-All right?
-lf....

47:48.960 --> 47:51.269
-lf we're--
-Yes?

47:52.880 --> 47:54.996
Look, it's quite simple.

47:55.080 --> 47:59.119
You stay here and make sure
he doesn't leave the room.

48:00.240 --> 48:02.231
-All right?
-l remember.

48:02.440 --> 48:04.670
Can he can he leave the room with us?

48:05.080 --> 48:08.755
No, you just keep him in here,
and make sure--

48:08.840 --> 48:11.035
Yes! We'll keep him in here, obviously.

48:11.120 --> 48:14.157
-But if he had to leave--
-No. Keep him in here!

48:14.280 --> 48:16.874
-Until you, or anyone--
-Not anyone, just me.

48:16.960 --> 48:19.235
-Just you....
-Get back.

48:19.560 --> 48:20.515
-Right?
-Right.

48:20.600 --> 48:22.511
We'll stay here until you get back.

48:22.600 --> 48:25.273
-And make sure he doesn't leave.
-What?

48:26.560 --> 48:29.518
-Make sure he doesn't leave.
-The Prince?

48:29.600 --> 48:32.797
-Yes, make sure he doesn't leave.
-Yes, of course!

48:32.880 --> 48:34.438
l thought you meant him!

48:34.520 --> 48:38.035
lt seemed a bit daft
me having to guard him when he's a guard.

48:38.480 --> 48:41.153
-ls that clear?
-Quite clear. No problems.

48:41.320 --> 48:42.309
Right.

48:44.440 --> 48:46.954
-Where are you going?
-We're coming with you.

48:47.040 --> 48:50.999
l want you to stay here,
and make sure he doesn't leave.

48:51.480 --> 48:52.674
l see, right.

48:53.440 --> 48:56.955
-But, Father--
-Shut it, and get that suit on.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.231
And no singing!

49:06.640 --> 49:08.471
Go and get a glass of water.

49:55.280 --> 49:57.748
-Well taken, Concorde!
-Thank you, sir, most kind.

49:57.840 --> 49:59.319
And again!

49:59.600 --> 50:02.592
Over we go! Good, steady!

50:02.680 --> 50:04.796
Now, the big one!

50:05.600 --> 50:07.556
Come on, Concorde!

50:08.640 --> 50:10.631
Message for you, sir.

50:13.120 --> 50:14.917
Concorde, speak to me!

50:24.200 --> 50:25.792
''To whoever finds this note...

50:25.880 --> 50:29.793
''...l have been imprisoned by my father...

50:30.160 --> 50:32.674
''...who wishes me to marry
against my will.

50:32.760 --> 50:35.194
''Please, please come and rescue me.

50:35.680 --> 50:38.990
''l am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle.''

50:39.080 --> 50:42.231
At last! A call! A cry of distress!

50:42.320 --> 50:45.357
This could be the sign
that leads us to the Holy Grail!

50:45.480 --> 50:49.871
Brave Concorde,
you shall not have died in vain!

50:50.200 --> 50:51.838
l'm not quite dead, sir.

50:53.840 --> 50:56.354
You shall not have been mortally wounded
in vain!

50:56.440 --> 50:58.635
l think l could pull through, sir.

50:59.640 --> 51:02.029
-l see.
-l think l'm all right to come with you.

51:02.120 --> 51:03.792
No, sweet Concorde! Stay here.

51:03.880 --> 51:06.917
l will send help as soon as
l have accomplished a daring and...

51:07.000 --> 51:09.639
...heroic rescue in my own particular....

51:12.800 --> 51:14.518
-ldiom, sir?
-ldiom!

51:14.680 --> 51:17.911
-No, l feel fine, actually, sir.
-Farewell, sweet Concorde!

51:18.880 --> 51:21.917
l'll just stay here, shall l, sir?

51:23.880 --> 51:24.949
Yeah.

52:46.800 --> 52:47.789
Hey!

53:37.040 --> 53:39.270
You're not allowed to enter the room--

53:41.240 --> 53:44.118
Fair one, behold your servant,
Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

53:44.200 --> 53:47.954
-l have come to take.... l'm terribly sorry.
-You got my note!

53:48.280 --> 53:51.989
-l got a note.
-You've come to rescue me?

53:52.400 --> 53:55.073
-Well, no, you see--
-l knew someone would.

53:55.360 --> 53:59.797
l knew that somewhere out there,
there must be someone--

54:00.560 --> 54:02.676
Stop that! Stop it!

54:04.160 --> 54:05.115
Who are you?

54:05.200 --> 54:06.758
-l'm your son.
-No, not you.

54:06.840 --> 54:09.912
-l'm Sir Lancelot, sir.
-He's come to rescue me, Father.

54:10.000 --> 54:14.039
-Let's not jump to conclusions.
-Did you kill all those guards?

54:14.160 --> 54:15.878
Yes. Sorry.

54:15.960 --> 54:18.315
-They cost 50 pounds each.
-l'm awfully sorry.

54:18.400 --> 54:22.313
Don't be afraid of him, Sir Lancelot.
l've got a rope ready.

54:23.040 --> 54:25.315
You killed eight wedding guests and all!

54:25.480 --> 54:27.710
Well, you see,
l thought your son was a lady.

54:27.800 --> 54:29.074
l can understand that.

54:29.160 --> 54:31.390
-Hurry, Sir Lancelot! Hurry!
-Shut up!

54:31.480 --> 54:34.756
-You only killed the bride's father!
-l didn't mean to.

54:34.840 --> 54:37.479
Didn't mean to?
You put your sword through his head!

54:37.560 --> 54:40.438
-Oh dear, is he all right?
-You kicked the bride in the chest!

54:40.520 --> 54:42.909
-lt's going to cost me a fortune!
-l can explain.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.629
l was in the forest, riding north
from Camelot when l got this note.

54:46.720 --> 54:49.234
-Are you from Camelot?
-Hurry, Sir Lancelot!

54:49.360 --> 54:51.191
l'm a knight of King Arthur, sir.

54:51.280 --> 54:54.192
Very nice castle, Camelot.
Very good pig country.

54:55.040 --> 54:57.952
-ls it?
-l am ready!

54:58.040 --> 55:01.635
-Would you like to come have a drink?
-That's awfully nice of you.

55:01.960 --> 55:04.997
-l am ready!
-l mean, to be so understanding.

55:05.080 --> 55:08.834
You see, when l'm in this idiom,
l sometimes get a bit carried away.

55:15.240 --> 55:18.550
Now, this is the main hall.
We'll have all this knocked through--

55:18.640 --> 55:22.189
-There he is!
-Bloody hell.

55:31.200 --> 55:34.795
-Hold it, please!
-See what l mean? l get carried away.

55:34.880 --> 55:37.678
l'm really most awfully sorry.
Sorry, everyone.

55:37.760 --> 55:39.113
He's killed the best man!

55:40.600 --> 55:45.196
Hold it, please, hold it.
This is Sir Lancelot...

55:45.280 --> 55:50.195
...from the Court of Camelot,
a brave and influential knight.

55:50.600 --> 55:53.353
-And my special guest here today.
-Hello.

55:53.440 --> 55:54.953
He killed my auntie!

55:55.720 --> 56:00.157
No, please!
This is supposed to be a happy occasion!

56:00.240 --> 56:04.028
Let's not bicker and argue
about who killed who.

56:04.760 --> 56:09.072
We are here today to witness the union
of two young people...

56:09.200 --> 56:11.430
...in the joyful bond of holy wedlock.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.629
Unfortunately, one of them,
my son Herbert...

56:17.360 --> 56:19.351
...has just fallen to his death.

56:20.160 --> 56:23.516
But l don't want to think l've lost a son,
so much as...

56:23.960 --> 56:25.598
...gained a daughter.

56:26.280 --> 56:29.397
For, since the tragic death of her father--

56:29.480 --> 56:31.471
He's not quite dead!

56:32.800 --> 56:35.712
Since the near fatal wounding
of her father--

56:35.800 --> 56:38.189
He's getting better!

56:39.360 --> 56:42.557
For, since her own father...

56:42.640 --> 56:45.837
...who, when he seemed about to recover...

56:46.280 --> 56:49.590
...suddenly felt the icy hand of death
upon him.

56:50.480 --> 56:51.595
He's died!

56:52.080 --> 56:55.595
l want his only daughter to look upon me...

56:55.680 --> 56:59.958
...as her own dad, in a very real,
and legally binding sense.

57:01.720 --> 57:06.236
And l feel sure that the merger....
The union between the Princess...

57:06.920 --> 57:10.469
...and the brave but dangerous
Sir Lancelot of Camelot--

57:10.920 --> 57:13.878
-What?
-Look, the dead Prince!

57:16.480 --> 57:19.836
-He's not quite dead!
-l feel much better.

57:19.920 --> 57:22.673
You fell out of the tall tower, you creep!

57:22.960 --> 57:26.589
-No, l was saved at the last minute.
-How?

57:26.840 --> 57:28.432
l'll tell you.

57:29.720 --> 57:32.154
Not like that! Not like that.

57:32.240 --> 57:35.710
''He's going tell
He's going to tell''

57:40.040 --> 57:41.871
Quickly, sir, come this way!

57:41.960 --> 57:45.669
No, it's not right for my idiom.
l must escape more....

57:47.480 --> 57:50.552
-Dramatically, sir?
-Dramatically.

58:02.200 --> 58:04.634
Excuse me,
could somebody give me a push, please?

58:20.040 --> 58:21.632
Old crone!

58:23.160 --> 58:26.550
ls there anywhere in this town
where we could buy a shrubbery?

58:27.360 --> 58:30.716
-Who sent you?
-The knights who say, ''Ni''!

58:30.840 --> 58:33.559
No! We have no shrubberies here.

58:33.640 --> 58:37.599
lf you do not tell us where we can buy
a shrubbery, my friend and l...

58:37.960 --> 58:39.154
...will say....

58:40.320 --> 58:43.039
We will say, ''Ni.''

58:43.600 --> 58:44.874
Do your worst!

58:44.960 --> 58:48.919
Very well.
lf you will not assist us voluntarily...

58:52.480 --> 58:53.595
-...Ni!
-No!

58:54.320 --> 58:56.515
Never. No shrubberies.

58:56.840 --> 58:58.480
-Ni!
-Noo!

58:58.480 --> 59:00.516
No, it's not that, it's ''Ni.''

59:03.720 --> 59:05.040
No, you're not doing it properly.

59:05.040 --> 59:06.393
-Ni.
-You've got it.

59:06.480 --> 59:08.550
-Ni!
-Ni!

59:08.640 --> 59:11.598
Are you saying ''Ni'' to that old woman?

59:12.640 --> 59:13.470
Yes.

59:13.560 --> 59:18.588
What sad times are these when passing
ruffians can say, ''Ni'' at will to old ladies.

59:19.160 --> 59:22.232
There is a pestilence upon this land.
Nothing is sacred.

59:22.560 --> 59:26.189
Even those who arrange shrubberies
are under considerable economic stress...

59:26.280 --> 59:28.191
...at this period in history.

59:28.280 --> 59:30.874
-Did you say ''shrubberies''?
-Yes.

59:30.960 --> 59:33.872
Shrubberies are my trade.
l am a shrubber.

59:33.960 --> 59:38.351
My name is Roger the Shrubber.
l arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.

59:39.120 --> 59:41.236
-Ni!
-No!

59:42.200 --> 59:45.033
Knights of Ni,
we have brought you your shrubbery.

59:45.120 --> 59:47.350
-May we go?
-lt is a good shrubbery.

59:47.560 --> 59:51.712
l like the laurels particularly.
But there is one small problem.

59:52.240 --> 59:53.309
What is that?

59:53.400 --> 59:57.200
We are now no longer
the knights who say ''Ni.''

59:57.200 --> 59:58.600
We are now the knights who say:

59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.192
''Ekke Ekke Ekke Ptang Zoo Boing''!

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.800
Therefore, we must give you a test.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.270
What's is this test,
knights who until recently said ''Ni''?

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.030
Firstly, you must find...

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.392
...another shrubbery!

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.875
Not another shrubbery!

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.555
Then you must bring it here
beside this shrubbery.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.150
Higher, so you get the two-level effect,
a path going down the middle.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:28.196
A path! A path!

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.272
Then, when you have found
the shrubberies...

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.791
...you must cut down
the mightiest tree in the forest...

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.557
...with a herring!

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.320
-We shall do no such thing.
-Please.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.712
Cut down a tree with a herring?
lt can't be done.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.197
-Don't say that word.
-What word?

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.191
l cannot tell. Suffice to say...

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.874
...it's one of the words
the knights of Ni cannot hear.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.758
How can we not say the word
if you don't tell us what it is?

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.876
-He did it again.
-What? ''ls''?

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.714
You wouldn't get very far in life
not saying ''is.''

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.833
My liege, it's Robin.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:09.152
''He's jacking it in and packing it up
And sneaking away and buggering up

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:13.677
''And chickening out and pissing a pot
Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge''

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.954
-Robin.
-My liege.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.598
lt's good to see you.

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.148
You haven't given up your quest
for the Holy Grail?

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.595
-''He is sneaking away and--''
-Shut up!

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.469
-No, far from it.
-You said the word again.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:28.951
l was looking for it here in this forest.

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:33.312
-No, it is far from this place.
-Stop saying the word!

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.755
-The word we cannot hear!
-Stop it!

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.876
-He said, ''it'' again!
-That's it!

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.838
l've said, ''it.'' l've said, ''it.''
l've said, ''it'' again!

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:43.036
That's three ''its''!

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.278
And so Arthur and Bedevere and
Sir Robin set out on their search to find...

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:57.114
...the enchanter of whom
the old man had spoken in Scene 24.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.319
Beyond the forest
they met Lancelot and Galahad...

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.709
...and there was much rejoicing.

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:16.876
In the frozen land of Nador...

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.633
...they were forced to eat
Robin's minstrels.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.794
And there was much rejoicing.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.592
A year passed.

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.635
Winter changed into spring.

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:34.196
Spring changed into summer.

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:37.075
Summer changed back into winter...

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:42.393
...and winter gave spring and summer
a miss and went straight on into autumn.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:43.909
Until one day.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.196
Knights...

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:08.914
...forward!

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.834
What manner of man are you,
that can summon up fire...

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:51.550
-...without flint or tinder?
-l am an enchanter.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:57.835
-By what name are you known?
-There are some who call me...

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.434
-...Tim.
-Greetings, Tim the enchanter!

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.795
Greetings, King Arthur.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.192
-You know my name?
-l do.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.514
You seek the Holy Grail.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.078
That is our quest.
You know much that is hidden, Tim.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.309
Quite.

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.549
Yes, we are looking for the Holy Grail.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:36.554
-Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.
-Yes, it is.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.757
-And so we're looking for it.
-Yes, we are.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:45.559
-We have been for some time.
-Ages.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:52.312
So, anything you could do to help
would be...

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:55.749
...very...

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.673
-...helpful.
-Look, can you tell us where--

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.272
Fine, l don't want to waste
any more of your time...

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.114
...but l don't suppose you could tell us
where we might find a....

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.638
A what?

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.233
A grail?

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:20.390
Yes, l think so.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:21.955
Yes.

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.149
Yes!

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.999
-Thank you.
-Splendid!

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:35.148
Look, you're a busy man--

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:39.711
Yes, l can help you find the Holy Grail.

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:44.716
To the north, there lies a cave.
The Cave of Caerbannog.

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:48.839
Wherein, carved in mystic runes,
upon the very living rock...

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.597
...the last words
of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged...

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:59.395
...make plain the last resting place
of the most Holy Grail.

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:03.232
-Where could we find this cave, Tim?
-Follow!

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:08.559
But follow only if ye be men of valour.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.276
For the entrance to this cave
is guarded by a creature...

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:15.877
...so foul, so cruel...

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:19.077
...that no man yet
has fought with it and lived.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:27.231
Bones of full 50 men lie strewn
about its lair. So, brave knights...

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:33.350
...if you do doubt your courage
or your strength, come no further...

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:38.434
...for death awaits you all
with nasty, big, pointy teeth.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.517
What an eccentric performance!

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:56.873
They're nervous, sire.

01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:59.474
Then we'd best leave them here
and carry on, on foot.

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.551
Dismount!

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:17.434
Behold the Cave of Caerbannog!

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.752
-Right, keep me covered.
-What with?

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:25.755
-Just keep me covered.
-Too late.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.155
There he is!

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.190
-Where?
-There.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.112
-What, behind the rabbit?
-lt is the rabbit.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.515
-You silly sod!
-What?

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.999
You got us all worked up.

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.718
That's no ordinary rabbit.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:49.635
That's the most foul, cruel and
bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on.

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:53.190
You tit! l soiled my armour
l was so scared!

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:56.676
Look, that rabbit's got
a vicious streak a mile wide.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:58.671
-lt's a killer!
-Get stuffed.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.990
-He'll do you up a treat, mate!
-Yeah?

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.514
-You manky Scots git!
-l'm warning you.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:07.115
-What's he do? Nibble your bum?
-He's got huge, sharp....

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.792
lt can leap about....

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.516
-Look at the bones!
-Go on, Bors, chop its head off.

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:17.189
Right. Silly little bleeder.
One rabbit stew coming right up.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.029
Look!

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.676
-Jesus Christ!
-l warned you!

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.751
-l've done it again.
-l warned you.

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:32.037
But did you listen to me?
No, you knew it all, didn't you?

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:36.557
lt's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it?
Well, it's always the same.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.154
-l always--
-Shut up!

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.312
Charge!

01:08:58.319 --> 01:09:00.675
Run away!

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.636
-How many did we lose?
-Gawain.

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.676
-Ector.
-And Bors. That's five.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:15.636
-Three.
-Three.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.515
We better not risk another frontal assault,
that rabbit's dynamite.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.113
Would it help to confuse it
if we run away more?

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:25.430
-Shut up and change your armour.
-Let us taunt it.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.193
lt may become so cross,
that it will make a mistake.

01:09:28.279 --> 01:09:29.349
Like what?

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.589
Well....

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.517
-Have we got bows?
-No.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.875
-We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
-Yes, of course!

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.631
The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:43.439
lt's one of the sacred relics
Brother Maynard carries.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.478
Brother Maynard!
Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.908
How does it....

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.715
How does it work?

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:22.519
-l know not, my liege.
-Consult the Book of Armaments.

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:26.229
Armaments 2: 9-21.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:33.194
''And St. Attila raised the hand grenade
up on high, saying:

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:37.839
'''O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade,
that with it thou mayest...

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:41.435
'''...blow thine enemies
to tiny bits, in thy mercy.'

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:45.038
''And the Lord did grin
and the people did feast upon...

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:50.114
''...the lambs and sloths and carp
and anchovies and orangutans...

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.709
''...and breakfast cereals
and fruit bats and--''

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.233
Skip a bit, Brother.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:00.511
''The Lord spake, saying,
'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin...

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.154
'''...then shalt thou count to three,
no more, no less.

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.954
'''Three shalt be the number
thou shalt count...

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.918
'''...and the number
of the counting shalt be three.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:15.956
'''Four shalt thou not count,
neither count thou two...

'''...excepting that thou then
proceed to three.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.555
'''Five is right out.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.036
'''Once the number three,
being the third number be reached...

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:30.591
'''...then lobbest thou
thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch...

'''...towards thy foe,

'''...shall snuff it.'''

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.229
Amen.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.429
Amen.

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.555
Right.

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:43.350
One, two, five!

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.237
-Three, sir!
-Three!

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.753
There! Look!

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.915
What does it say? What language is that?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.150
Brother Maynard, you're our scholar.

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:37.799
lt is Aramaic!

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.873
Of course. Joseph of Arimathea!

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.191
-Of course.
-What does it say?

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:46.517
lt reads, ''Here may be found...

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:50.070
''...the last words of Joseph of Arimathea:

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.877
'''He who is valiant and pure of spirit...

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.756
'''...may find the Holy Grail...

01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:01.198
'''...in the Castle of Aaargh.'''

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.155
What?

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.555
''The Castle of Aaargh.''

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:10.394
What is that?

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.036
He must have died while carving it.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.839
-Come on!
-That's what it says.

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:19.396
Look, if he was dying,
he wouldn't bother to carve ''Aaargh.''

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.876
-He'd just say it.
-That's what's carved in the rock.

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:25.151
-Perhaps he was dictating it.
-Shut up!

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:27.435
-Does it say anything else?
-No!

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.637
Just ''Aaargh.''

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.829
Aaargh.

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:38.515
Do you suppose he meant the Camargue?

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.511
-Where's that?
-ln France, l think.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:45.196
-lsn't there a St. Aaargh's in Cornwall?
-No, that's St. lves.

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:47.550
St. lves.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:52.074
No, ''Aaargh.'' At the back of the throat.

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:55.152
No, in surprise and alarm!

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.039
-You mean a sort of a ''Ah!''
-Yes, that's right.

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:00.635
My God!

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:08.036
lt's the Legendary Black Beast of Aaargh!

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.953
That's it! Run away!

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:27.588
We've lost him.

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.959
As the horrendous Black Beast
lunged foreard...

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.313
...escape for Arthur
and his knights seemed hopeless.

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:39.234
When, suddenly, the animator
suffered a fatal heart attack.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.028
The cartoon peril was no more.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.553
The quest for the Holy Grail
could continue.

01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.758
There it is!

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.039
-The Bridge of Death.
-Great.

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:06.033
Look! There's the old man from Scene 24.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:09.715
-What's he doing here?
-He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death.

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.430
He asks each traveller five questions.

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.397
-Three questions.
-Three questions.

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:17.916
-He who answers the five questions--
-Three questions.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.278
-Three questions, may cross in safety.
-What if you get a question wrong?

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:25.716
Then you are cast
into the gorge of eternal peril.

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:28.997
-Oh, wacko.
-Who's going to answer the questions?

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:31.839
Brave Sir Robin, you go.

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.471
l've got a great idea:

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:36.559
Why doesn't Lancelot go?

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.279
Yes, let me go, my liege.
l will take him single-handed.

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:42.875
-l shall make a feint to the northeast....
-Hang on!

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.594
-Just answer the five questions--
-Three questions.

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:49.514
Three questions, as best you can.
And we shall watch and pray.

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.472
l understand, my liege.

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:55.190
Good luck, brave Sir Lancelot.
God be with you.

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.469
Stop!

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.437
Who would cross the Bridge of Death,
must answer me these questions three.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.716
Ere the other side he see.

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:11.798
Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper.
l'm not afraid.

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:15.794
-What is your name?
-My name is Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.192
What is your quest?

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.396
To seek the Holy Grail.

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.916
What is your favourite colour?

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.510
-Blue.
-Right. Off you go.

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.751
Well, thank you very much.

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.189
That's easy.

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.109
Stop.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:43.311
Who approacheth the Bridge of Death,
must answer me these questions three.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.796
Ere the other side he see.

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:49.239
Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper.
l'm not afraid.

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:52.790
-What is your name?
-Sir Robin of Camelot.

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:56.232
-What is your quest?
-To seek the Holy Grail.

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.596
What is the capital of Assyria?

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:02.548
l don't know that!

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:11.836
Stop!

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.270
-What is your name?
-Sir Galahad of Camelot.

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:19.751
-What is your quest?
-l seek the Grail.

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:23.592
-What is your favourite colour?
-Blue.

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.389
No! Yellow!

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.549
Stop!

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:37.679
-What is your name?
-lt is Arthur, King of the Britons.

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:41.595
-What is your quest?
-To seek the Holy Grail.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:45.631
What is the air-speed velocity
of an unladen swallow?

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:49.113
What do you mean?
An African or European swallow?

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:51.553
l don't know that!

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.835
How do you know
so much about swallows?

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:02.520
You have to know these things
when you're a king.

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:41.749
Lancelot!

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.189
Lancelot!

01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:58.708
Lancelot!

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:47.515
The Castle Aaargh. Our quest is at an end.

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:07.433
God be praised.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.279
Almighty God...

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:16.069
...we thank thee, that thou hast vouchsafed
to us the most holy--

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:18.757
Jesus Christ!

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:23.800
Dirty English knights.

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.360
Monsieur Arthur King,
who has the brain of a duck.

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:29.716
So, we French fellows
outwit you a second time.

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:32.718
How dare you profane this place
with your presence?

01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:36.549
l command you,
in the name of the knights of Camelot...

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:39.633
...to open the doors of this sacred castle...

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:43.150
...to which God himself has guided us.

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:48.360
How you English say?
l'll unclog my nose in your direction.

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.873
Sons of a window-dresser!

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.428
So, you think you could
out-clever us French folk...

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:55.910
...with your silly knees-bent,
running about, advancing behaviour.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.673
l wave my private parts at your aunties.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:03.351
You cheesy lot of second-hand,
electric donkey-bottom biters!

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.476
ln the name of the Lord...

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:09.155
...we demand entrance
to this sacred castle!

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:11.913
No chance, English bed-wetting types.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.073
l burst my pimples at you, and call your
door-opening request a silly thing!

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:19.436
You tiny-brained wipers
of other people's bottoms.

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.035
lf you'll not open this door,
we shall take this castle by force!

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.035
ln the name of God and the glory of our--

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:31.234
Right! That settles it!

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.992
Depart at this time,
and don't be approaching any more...

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:39.596
...or we fire arrows into your heads,
and make castanets out of your testicles.

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.238
Walk away, just ignore them.

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:45.074
And now remain gone,
illegitimate-faced bugger-folk!

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:49.671
And, if you think you got a nasty
taunting this time, you ain't heard...

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:53.150
...nothing yet, dirty English knights!

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:17.078
-We shall attack at once.
-Yes, my liege.

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:19.037
Stand by for attack!

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.593
French persons!

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:22.109
Today the blood of many a valiant knight
shall be avenged.

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:25.837
ln the name of God,
we shall not stop our fight...

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:30.511
...till each one of you lies dead,
and the Holy Grail...

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:34.076
...returns to those whom God has chosen.

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:38.358
Charge!

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:05.269
Yes, they're the ones, l'm sure.

01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:13.228
-Come on.
-Put this man in the van.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.719
-Put him in the van.
-Get a blanket over that one.

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:22.428
Come on, back! Right back!

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:26.710
That's an offensive weapon, that is.

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:31.870
All right, sonny, that's enough.
Pack that in.
