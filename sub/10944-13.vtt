Georgina, are you okay?

04:29.193 --> 04:30.694
How did Spartan just fall
like that?

04:32.063 --> 04:34.164
Sometimes things happen
when horses jump, you know.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.966
I mean, maybe...

04:36.034 --> 04:37.401
Maybe he threw a shoe.

04:37.469 --> 04:38.936
That happened to me
in a horse show once.

04:39.003 --> 04:40.571
(Chuckles)

04:40.639 --> 04:42.605
Only three points separated me
and Sue-Anne Kurtofsky,

04:42.673 --> 04:45.742
and then my horse threw a shoe
and that little-

04:45.810 --> 04:46.843
When horses get hurt
like that,

04:46.911 --> 04:48.711
don't they just...
shoot 'em?

04:49.814 --> 04:51.013
No.

04:51.081 --> 04:53.115
No, that is not gonna happen.

04:54.852 --> 04:56.519
Meanwhile,
what about this guy?

04:56.587 --> 04:57.753
Hmm?

04:57.821 --> 05:00.021
Doesn't he deserve
a nice brushing?

05:00.089 --> 05:01.490
A good bran mash?

05:01.558 --> 05:02.991
<i>A turn out?</i>

05:05.929 --> 05:07.896
The rule with horses is:

05:07.964 --> 05:11.099
No matter how we're feeling,
their needs always come first.

05:16.004 --> 05:17.538
(Sighs heavily)

05:32.219 --> 05:33.954

05:36.090 --> 05:37.457
Amy:
What if Mr. Malon comes back?

05:37.525 --> 05:38.992
Amy's mom:
I hope he does!

05:39.059 --> 05:40.594
(Lightning cracks)
Look what he did to this horse!

05:40.661 --> 05:41.327
Amy: (Spartan whinnies

05:41.395 --> 05:42.996
(Spartan whinnies)

05:43.063 --> 05:45.931
Mr. Malon: Hey, lady, what the
hell you doin' with my horse?!

05:45.999 --> 05:48.166
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>I know that you blame me,</i>

05:48.234 --> 05:51.567
but we were just trying
to help you!

05:52.772 --> 05:55.107
(Tearful)
It's not my fault!

05:55.174 --> 05:56.709
It's not my fault!

06:01.214 --> 06:03.248
(Spartan snorts quietly)

06:08.787 --> 06:10.455
Amy:
It's okay, boy.

06:14.060 --> 06:16.094
You know,
maybe the ground was uneven.

06:16.162 --> 06:18.262
We should have harrowed it
in between every class.

06:18.330 --> 06:20.764
We're gonna do some X-rays.

06:20.832 --> 06:23.767
Ty, could you give me
a hand?

06:23.835 --> 06:26.603
<i>Amy: It was just a last minute
kind of schooling show.</i>

06:26.671 --> 06:28.772
We didn't have a ground crew
or anything.

06:28.840 --> 06:31.342
<i>Maybe the sand was hard,</i>
<i>the ground was uneven...</i>

06:31.410 --> 06:32.676
I should have known
this was gonna happen.

06:32.744 --> 06:34.644
Jack: Amy, you gotta
stop doing this.

06:34.711 --> 06:36.279
You're just beating
yourself up.

06:36.347 --> 06:38.981
You know as well as anyone,
one bad step is all it takes.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.316
<i>Scott:</i>
<i>Ty's right.</i>

06:40.384 --> 06:41.984
A horse this age
could have pre-existing issues,

06:42.053 --> 06:45.155
like a strained tendon
or a hairline fracture.

06:45.222 --> 06:47.157
Either one could lead
to a break.

06:47.224 --> 06:49.225
What do you mean?
What are you saying?

06:49.293 --> 06:52.494
No one's saying anything
until Scott's seen the X-rays.

06:52.562 --> 06:54.863
You think his leg's broken.

07:02.705 --> 07:04.573
(Truck rumbles loudly)

07:07.709 --> 07:09.277
Tim:
Hey!

07:09.344 --> 07:11.579
Hey, look who's back!

07:11.646 --> 07:12.947
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

07:13.014 --> 07:15.116
What? That's all I get?
No, "how are you, Dad?"

07:15.184 --> 07:16.350
<i>"How was your trip?"</i>

07:16.418 --> 07:18.186
<i>"Good to see you, Dad?"</i>

07:18.253 --> 07:20.321
Actually, I had a great time
in Moose Jaw.

07:20.999 --> 07:22.755
That's something
you don't hear everyday -

07:22.823 --> 07:24.391
Great time and Moose Jaw
in the same sentence.

07:24.459 --> 07:25.725
- Dad...
- And Shane?

07:25.793 --> 07:27.634
He is really growing up
to be a fine young man.

07:27.661 --> 07:29.696
And that private school,
phew,

07:29.763 --> 07:31.098
I mean, it's worth
every penny.

07:31.165 --> 07:33.385
- Dad...
- We're really starting to be a family.

07:33.433 --> 07:35.702
And Miranda,
she is amazing.

07:35.769 --> 07:36.703
You know,
she and I are-

07:36.770 --> 07:38.370
Dad!

07:38.438 --> 07:40.606
Something really terrible
has happened.

07:52.818 --> 07:54.952
Jack:
So... (Raps on car)

07:55.020 --> 07:57.355
What are you doing here?

07:57.423 --> 07:58.789
Mallory:
Nothing.

07:58.857 --> 08:00.291
I was just...

08:04.229 --> 08:05.562
How's Spartan?

08:05.630 --> 08:07.864
Well, we don't really
know yet.

08:07.932 --> 08:09.766
Did you see his leg?
He couldn't even walk on it.

08:09.834 --> 08:11.034
It must be broken.

08:11.102 --> 08:12.669
Well, Scott took
a few X-rays.

08:12.737 --> 08:14.804
He's probably lookin' at 'em
right now.

08:14.872 --> 08:15.972
How about Amy?

08:16.040 --> 08:18.875
Has she said anything
to you?

08:18.943 --> 08:22.276
Well, the only thing Amy's got
on her mind is Spartan, so...

08:22.412 --> 08:25.745
I was hoping...
Maybe I could see him?

08:26.617 --> 08:29.352
You see him tomorrow.
He's not going anywhere.

08:29.419 --> 08:31.787
Yeah, but...
If he broke his leg

08:31.855 --> 08:35.188
doesn't that usually,
you know,

08:35.392 --> 08:36.759
mean he has to get
put down?

08:36.826 --> 08:40.159
Oh, well, back in my day
that was pretty well the case,

08:40.296 --> 08:43.498
but modern medicine
the way it is now...

08:44.467 --> 08:47.202
I think I'm just gonna
hang around and wait.

08:47.270 --> 08:49.471
You know what, Mallory,
we're all waitin'

08:49.539 --> 08:50.739
and we're not helping
the situation

08:50.807 --> 08:52.073
by doin' it here,

08:52.641 --> 08:56.974
so that's why I'm leavin',
and you should too.

09:02.517 --> 09:03.951
(Truck starts up)

09:05.954 --> 09:07.988
(Hooves thudding)

09:11.893 --> 09:13.193
<i>Georgie:</i>
<i>Don't do it!</i>

09:15.429 --> 09:16.462
Phoenix, no!

09:17.732 --> 09:19.733
Don't you dare jump
that fence!

09:23.104 --> 09:24.503
(Grunts in pain)

09:24.571 --> 09:25.604
(Gasps)

09:28.809 --> 09:30.109
Don't you move!

09:34.514 --> 09:36.882
See what can happen
when you jump?

09:36.950 --> 09:38.584
You are so...
(Grunts in frustration)

09:38.651 --> 09:41.353
Lou:
Georgie, what's going on here?!

09:43.389 --> 09:45.290
Lou:
Are you hurt?

09:45.358 --> 09:46.658
Did he hurt you?

09:46.726 --> 09:48.727
No, but he could've
hurt himself!

09:48.794 --> 09:52.127
I mean, how can he be
such a total dummy?!

09:52.332 --> 09:54.966
Okay, what are you
talking about?

09:55.034 --> 09:57.201
Nothing.
It's just...

09:57.269 --> 10:00.602
What happened to Spartan,
it's not gonna happen to him.

10:00.672 --> 10:01.972
Cross my heart.

10:03.141 --> 10:05.008
I gotta get more mash.

10:09.948 --> 10:11.716
Scott:
See these faint white lines?

10:11.783 --> 10:15.116
They indicate fractures
in the long pastern.

10:15.486 --> 10:17.420
So, it is a break then.

10:17.488 --> 10:18.688
Well, a broken leg
doesn't mean

10:18.689 --> 10:20.657
an automatic death sentence
anymore.

10:20.725 --> 10:22.091
There's something
you can do?

10:22.159 --> 10:23.326
Well, no guarantees,

10:23.394 --> 10:25.328
but because of Ty's
good work splinting

10:25.396 --> 10:26.829
and the location
of the fracture,

10:26.897 --> 10:30.230
I think a surgical repair
is a possibility.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.902
That's great.
That's really great.

10:32.970 --> 10:35.271
And usually
it always goes well.

10:35.338 --> 10:37.506
What do you mean by usually?

10:38.441 --> 10:40.777
Ty:
He means almost always.

10:44.047 --> 10:46.481
Amy: Don't sugarcoat
this for me, guys.

10:46.548 --> 10:49.151
<i>I'm not some horse-crazy</i>
<i>little girl.</i>

10:49.218 --> 10:50.819
You have to promise
to tell me the truth,

10:50.820 --> 10:52.654
no matter what it is.

10:52.721 --> 10:54.189
Well, there are some
situations

10:54.257 --> 10:56.391
when you see one thing
in an X-ray,

10:56.458 --> 10:57.759
then you open up
the leg

10:57.827 --> 10:59.360
and then the bone is
in 3 pieces

10:59.428 --> 11:01.061
<i>or 500 pieces,</i>

11:01.129 --> 11:02.997
<i>just like a bag</i>
<i>of crushed ice.</i>

11:03.064 --> 11:04.899
So then what do you do?

11:04.966 --> 11:07.401
Well, then you're looking
at a very poor outcome.

11:07.468 --> 11:09.736
Infection, laminitis,

11:09.805 --> 11:12.606
and some horses won't tolerate
being laid up.

11:12.674 --> 11:14.408
<i>Jack: Watch out, watch
out, here he comes!</i>

11:14.475 --> 11:15.876
(Hooves clatter on metal)

11:15.944 --> 11:17.510
Scott: Losin' him, losin' him!
Oh!

11:17.577 --> 11:18.938
<i>I found out</i>
<i>he used to be a jumper.</i>

11:18.979 --> 11:20.780
<i>His name is Spartan.</i>

11:20.848 --> 11:21.714
(Spartan whinnies shrilly)

11:21.782 --> 11:22.648
Jack:
Whoa! Whoa!

11:22.716 --> 11:24.184
Whoa! Easy now!

11:24.251 --> 11:25.572
Scott:
What if this isn't working?

11:26.253 --> 11:27.253
Hey, boy.

11:27.321 --> 11:29.522
(Spartan whinnies shrilly)

11:30.825 --> 11:32.725
(Spartan whinnies
and stomps)

11:32.793 --> 11:34.193
It's okay.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.695
(Spartan whinnies restlessly)

11:38.932 --> 11:41.133
<i>Scott: There's a lot of
things to think about.</i>

11:41.201 --> 11:42.500
<i>I know it's Spartan</i>

11:42.568 --> 11:43.635
<i>and I know how much</i>
<i>he means to you,</i>

11:43.703 --> 11:45.503
but this kind of surgery
isn't cheap.

11:45.571 --> 11:46.839
Factor in all the costs,

11:46.906 --> 11:49.540
you can be lookin' up to
as much as $20,000.

11:49.607 --> 11:51.608
Amy: It's okay, we
have vet insurance.

11:51.676 --> 11:55.009
Scott: Yeah, but it's
not just the cost.

11:55.214 --> 11:56.680
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>What is it then?</i>

11:56.748 --> 11:58.916
Well, at the end of the day
you gotta ask yourself,

11:58.984 --> 12:02.086
will your horse be performing
at the same level,

12:02.154 --> 12:05.355
or will he have chronic problems
for the rest of his life?

12:05.422 --> 12:06.622
You could be putting this guy

12:06.690 --> 12:07.958
through a lot of pain
and suffering

12:08.025 --> 12:09.292
<i>for potentially little gain.</i>

12:09.360 --> 12:10.727
I'd never do that to him.

12:10.794 --> 12:11.995
<i>Scott:</i>
<i>I know.</i>

12:12.063 --> 12:13.930
That's why I gotta tell ya,

12:13.998 --> 12:17.300
euthanasia is something
you need to consider.

12:18.269 --> 12:19.302
Thank you.

12:20.271 --> 12:22.071
But the leg is unstable.

12:22.138 --> 12:24.173
So, if we're gonna operate,
sooner the better.

12:29.946 --> 12:31.580
I'll be on my cell.

12:41.524 --> 12:43.925
Mallory:
Scott! How's Spartan?

12:44.894 --> 12:47.128
Uh, too early to tell.

12:47.196 --> 12:49.564
He's gonna be okay though,
right?

12:49.632 --> 12:51.199
That's the plan.

12:51.267 --> 12:53.734
You know, I was riding him
when it happened.

12:53.802 --> 12:55.903
That must have been
quite the fall.

12:55.970 --> 12:57.538
How are you doing?

12:57.606 --> 13:00.939
I don't know why everyone
keeps asking me that.

13:01.142 --> 13:02.710
Go home, Mallory.

13:02.778 --> 13:03.844
I'm sure Amy will
give you a call

13:03.912 --> 13:05.946
when there's news.

13:10.217 --> 13:12.051
Lou: Well, the good news
is we have insurance.

13:12.119 --> 13:13.553
The cap is $5,000.

13:15.188 --> 13:16.723
Tim:
That must be the bad news.

13:16.791 --> 13:18.491
If Amy decides on the surgery

13:18.559 --> 13:21.193
then we're just gonna have
to come up with the rest.

13:21.261 --> 13:22.462
Georgie:
What if you can't?

13:22.530 --> 13:23.863
Tim:
You kiddin'?

13:23.931 --> 13:25.264
Between Jack and me,
money's not an issue.

13:25.332 --> 13:26.732
We could always
knock over a bank.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.367
You know, Tim, I don't think
this is a joking matter.

13:29.436 --> 13:30.402
Yeah, Dad.

13:30.470 --> 13:31.870
Tim:
Okay, okay...

13:32.539 --> 13:34.072
But, you know, we could hit
the Blackjack tables

13:34.140 --> 13:35.206
<i>at the Stoney reserve,</i>

13:35.274 --> 13:36.875
<i>'cause I have a secret system.</i>

13:36.943 --> 13:38.276
What's your system?

13:38.344 --> 13:39.611
Well, I can't tell you,

13:39.679 --> 13:41.046
it wouldn't be a secret,
would it?

13:41.113 --> 13:42.914
Okay, young lady,
I think it's past your bedtime.

13:42.981 --> 13:44.214
Come on.

13:44.282 --> 13:45.450
Georgie:
Okay.

13:47.319 --> 13:48.753
And, you know, could we please
not talk about money,

13:48.821 --> 13:50.922
because for the time being
I've got it covered.

13:50.989 --> 13:52.523
You've got it covered?

13:52.591 --> 13:54.058
Lou: I guaranteed payment
on my credit card

13:54.125 --> 13:56.226
before Scott even took
the first X-ray.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.496
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Good old Scott.</i>

13:59.564 --> 14:02.332
What happened to him being
a long-time friend of the family?

14:02.399 --> 14:03.199
Jack: Well, he's not
running a charity.

14:03.267 --> 14:04.367
He's runnin' a business.

14:04.435 --> 14:06.102
You know
how vet clinics work.

14:06.170 --> 14:07.471
Tim:
Tell me about it.

14:07.538 --> 14:10.406
The vet bills I paid,
between Cisco and Dexter

14:10.475 --> 14:12.208
came close to killin' me.

14:13.177 --> 14:14.877
Close, but no cigar.

14:21.417 --> 14:24.353
Lou: Do you want me to stay
until you fall asleep?

14:24.420 --> 14:26.555
Georgie:
(lndifferent grunt)

14:38.433 --> 14:41.469
Lou: I bet I know what
you're thinking about.

14:41.537 --> 14:44.506
Georgie:
Yeah? How do you know?

14:44.573 --> 14:47.906
Lou: 'Cause I'm
thinking about it, too.

14:48.110 --> 14:51.443
It was terrible watching Spartan
fall like that.

14:52.481 --> 14:53.881
But Scott is an amazing vet

14:53.948 --> 14:56.950
and he is gonna do
whatever it takes.

14:57.019 --> 14:58.052
You'll see.

14:59.721 --> 15:02.389
I know this may sound weird,
but...

15:03.991 --> 15:06.326
I'm kind of glad
I saw it happen.

15:06.394 --> 15:08.128
All right,
that does sound weird.

15:08.195 --> 15:09.695
Georgie:
I mean, horses,

15:09.763 --> 15:12.265
they let us sit on their backs
and jump over fences,

15:12.333 --> 15:13.466
and if a horse were
to get hurt,

15:13.534 --> 15:16.136
it would just get back up
and do it again.

15:16.203 --> 15:18.904
You're right.
He probably would.

15:18.971 --> 15:21.773
I mean, Spartan would probably
jump over a fence

15:21.841 --> 15:23.542
with three legs
if Amy asked him to.

15:23.609 --> 15:25.710
Probably.

15:25.778 --> 15:29.111
And that's why I am never ever
gonna jump Phoenix again!

15:30.183 --> 15:31.983
I will look after him
and I will love him,

15:32.052 --> 15:35.053
but I will never make him
do stupid things.

15:38.857 --> 15:40.491
Like jumping.

15:45.330 --> 15:46.997
(Crickets chirp)

15:47.066 --> 15:48.499
Amy:
You know,

15:48.567 --> 15:50.733
even if the surgery
goes well,

15:50.801 --> 15:54.134
and he doesn't get an infection
or laminitis,

15:54.605 --> 15:55.705
what if he goes crazy

15:55.773 --> 15:58.775
just standing in his stall
for weeks?

15:58.842 --> 16:00.544
You'll be with him.

16:00.611 --> 16:03.346
Spartan's been through
a lot in his life.

16:03.414 --> 16:04.548
From day one

16:04.615 --> 16:07.516
I know he's always been
special to you.

16:07.584 --> 16:08.850
He's gonna make it.

16:10.887 --> 16:13.189
If it wasn't for him...

16:14.824 --> 16:17.226
Watching you work
with that horse...

16:18.161 --> 16:21.063
Is what made me
fall in love with you.

16:35.811 --> 16:37.178
(Hooves thunder)

16:39.880 --> 16:42.216
Jack:
You built that course?

16:43.951 --> 16:44.985
Who knew?

16:49.357 --> 16:50.757
(Spartan snorts restlessly)

16:50.825 --> 16:52.126
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Spartan! Spartan, come on!</i>

16:52.193 --> 16:53.560
(Horse whinnies shrilly)

16:53.628 --> 16:54.827
Ty: You should open
up that side door.

16:54.894 --> 16:56.129
It's no wonder
he won't go in.

16:56.196 --> 16:57.763
It looks like a bloody jail cell
in there.

16:57.831 --> 16:58.831
(Motorcycle revs)

16:58.898 --> 17:00.600
Amy:
That's a good boy.

17:00.667 --> 17:03.402
You decided to join me,
have you?

17:07.241 --> 17:08.508
You did it.

17:08.575 --> 17:10.375
Thanks for your advice,
it really worked.

17:10.443 --> 17:11.675
Ty:
No problem.

17:11.743 --> 17:13.044
Both:
(Chuckle shyly)

17:15.147 --> 17:18.481
Amy: What if he can never
jump or even run again?

17:20.153 --> 17:21.786
Ty:
Then...

17:21.854 --> 17:24.556
He'll retire to a nice
big grassy field

17:24.624 --> 17:26.223
and live happily ever after.

17:26.290 --> 17:29.624
Amy: Not if he's in pain
the rest of his life.

17:30.195 --> 17:31.262
Ty, what...

17:31.329 --> 17:33.430
What if I'm just being selfish

17:33.498 --> 17:36.233
and I'm not thinking about
what's best for him?

17:38.736 --> 17:40.204
Come on.

17:40.272 --> 17:42.205
I'm wanna show you somethin'.

17:42.273 --> 17:44.307
(Truck door opens)
Come on.

17:50.513 --> 17:51.714
This is Rusty.

17:54.484 --> 17:56.152
He's in
for a tooth extraction.

17:56.219 --> 17:57.787
Aw, poor guy.

17:57.854 --> 18:00.422
Nobody likes the dentist.

18:00.490 --> 18:01.924
A year ago,
he broke his pastern

18:01.992 --> 18:04.258
in a barrel racing
accident.

18:04.326 --> 18:06.260
Scott did the surgery.

18:06.328 --> 18:07.962
He recovered well...
(Pats horses rump)

18:08.030 --> 18:10.565
- And now he's back in training.
- Ty...

18:10.632 --> 18:13.965
I get what you're doing
and I love you for it,

18:15.104 --> 18:17.839
but this horse
isn't Spartan.

18:18.808 --> 18:20.774
I get that, Amy,

18:20.842 --> 18:22.976
but you gotta make
a decision.

18:23.044 --> 18:25.345
The sooner you do the surgery,
the lower the risks.

18:25.413 --> 18:28.615
Yeah, but there still
are risks...

18:28.683 --> 18:30.951
And I'm not sure
I'm willing to take them.

18:40.884 --> 18:43.217
- Hey, Ty, breakfast.
- Hey. Thanks.

18:43.285 --> 18:46.618
So what's going on?
I gotta get my day on.

18:46.855 --> 18:48.990
I still don't know.
I've been talking to Amy,

18:49.058 --> 18:51.425
but I can't tell her
what to do.

18:51.493 --> 18:53.427
What's her sticking point?

18:53.495 --> 18:54.562
It's pretty simple.

18:54.629 --> 18:55.763
She doesn't want
Spartan to die,

18:55.831 --> 18:56.798
but she doesn't want him
to live in pain

18:56.865 --> 18:58.499
for the rest of his life
either.

18:58.567 --> 19:01.900
Well, I'm not gonna lie to her.
There's no guarantee.

19:02.036 --> 19:04.605
There could be complications.

19:04.673 --> 19:05.606
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

19:06.908 --> 19:09.577
<i>So I have just one question:</i>

19:11.145 --> 19:13.180
What would you do
if he was your horse?

19:15.382 --> 19:17.983
I'd take the risk.
I'd do the surgery.

19:20.987 --> 19:22.222
Then let's do it.

19:24.157 --> 19:25.191
Ty:
Okay.

19:30.296 --> 19:31.730
(Cows moo loudly)

19:35.501 --> 19:36.701
Tim: I still don't know
why you dragged me

19:36.702 --> 19:37.469
all the way up here.

19:37.537 --> 19:39.638
Jack:
This is important, Tim.

19:39.706 --> 19:42.140
Tim: I'll tell you what's
important, Amy's important.

19:42.208 --> 19:43.675
She needs me.

19:43.743 --> 19:45.344
Right now this is when
a daughter needs her father.

19:45.411 --> 19:47.411
Oh, sure she needs ya.

19:47.479 --> 19:49.313
She also needs you
to pony up some dough

19:49.381 --> 19:50.615
for the vet bill.

19:50.682 --> 19:52.550
I know that, Jack!

19:52.618 --> 19:54.285
Don't think I'm not
working on a plan.

19:54.353 --> 19:57.054
You don't need a plan,
just simple arithmetic.

19:58.357 --> 19:59.624
According to my count,

19:59.691 --> 20:02.325
we've got 41 cows
and 37 calves.

20:03.294 --> 20:05.295
They gained well
over the summer;

20:05.363 --> 20:06.730
They've got good weight.

20:06.797 --> 20:08.898
We sell the calves now
I figure we'd get $900 a pop.

20:08.966 --> 20:11.100
What?!
No, wait a second!

20:11.168 --> 20:13.403
Sell now?
No, we sell next year.

20:13.471 --> 20:14.771
We sell them
as long yearlings.

20:14.838 --> 20:16.105
$1200 a pop.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.474
Unless you've got another
get-rich quick scheme

20:18.541 --> 20:19.608
up your sleeve,

20:19.676 --> 20:21.677
I say we sell now,
we take the hit.

20:21.745 --> 20:23.306
It's the quickest way
to raise the cash.

20:23.346 --> 20:25.314
All right,
we sell now,

20:25.382 --> 20:26.548
and what do we do
next year?

20:26.616 --> 20:28.450
Well, we do a little talkin'
to the bank,

20:28.518 --> 20:31.487
we increase the operating loan.
It's only money, Tim.

20:31.554 --> 20:33.955
It comes and it goes,
but...

20:34.023 --> 20:37.356
But Amy's horse?
It's like family.

20:37.493 --> 20:39.494
It's irreplaceable.

20:39.561 --> 20:42.029
You know what
you sound like?

20:42.097 --> 20:43.364
You sound like
one of those commercials,

20:43.432 --> 20:45.667
that's what you
sound like.

20:45.734 --> 20:47.902
<i>But it worked.</i>

20:47.969 --> 20:49.270
I'm sold.

20:50.205 --> 20:52.038
(Chuckles)

20:52.106 --> 20:53.206
Jack:
Now where you goin'?

20:53.274 --> 20:54.874
Where do you think?

20:54.942 --> 20:56.677
I'm going to round up
some cows!

20:58.212 --> 20:59.212
Up!
(Crop whips through air)

20:59.280 --> 21:00.246
Up!
(Crop whips through air)

21:00.315 --> 21:01.981
Georgie: Lou!
Lou: Up, up.

21:02.049 --> 21:04.918
<i>Georgie:</i>
<i>What are you doing?!</i>

21:06.420 --> 21:09.455
I thought Phoenix was supposed
to be my horse!

21:09.523 --> 21:11.156
Lou:
You know he is.

21:13.393 --> 21:16.562
I told you that Phoenix
is never jumping again!

21:16.630 --> 21:17.797
Lou: Oh, so you're gonna
keep him from doing

21:17.864 --> 21:19.965
what he loves to do?

21:20.033 --> 21:23.366
Okay, I get it.
I totally get it.

21:23.469 --> 21:24.703
You do?
Yeah!

21:24.770 --> 21:26.571
That's exactly what I did
when I quit.

21:26.639 --> 21:28.239
Quit? Quit what?

21:28.307 --> 21:30.308
I told my mom that Bailey
would've been perfectly happy

21:30.376 --> 21:31.710
sitting in a field,

21:31.777 --> 21:33.712
but she said a jumper
needs to jump.

21:33.779 --> 21:36.214
So she sold him
to Sybil Harvey,

21:36.281 --> 21:37.582
and the next year
guess who won

21:37.650 --> 21:39.216
the high point
junior jumper rider

21:39.283 --> 21:40.851
at the Foothills Classic?

21:40.918 --> 21:42.686
Who is Bailey?

21:42.754 --> 21:45.456
Bailey was the horse
I used to show on.

21:45.523 --> 21:46.824
You used to show jump?

21:46.891 --> 21:49.593
Not just show jump.
Hunters, equitation...

21:49.661 --> 21:51.462
I even did cross-country.

21:51.529 --> 21:52.929
I don't believe you.

21:55.733 --> 21:58.200
<i>You know,</i>
<i>you don't have to do this.</i>

21:58.268 --> 22:00.236
Oh, yes, yes I do.

22:10.813 --> 22:12.180
(Hooves thunder)

22:40.642 --> 22:42.175
That was awesome!

22:42.243 --> 22:43.142
(Gasps)

22:43.210 --> 22:44.944
I am awesome!

22:45.012 --> 22:46.946
And you are awesome!

22:47.014 --> 22:48.014
And uh...

22:48.081 --> 22:50.917
And with all this
awesomeness,

22:50.984 --> 22:53.887
why did you even quit
in the first place?

22:53.954 --> 22:55.988
It's a long story.

22:57.591 --> 22:59.625
(Hooves thud)

23:00.894 --> 23:01.827
Whoa.

23:01.895 --> 23:03.562
It's okay.

23:03.630 --> 23:06.097
Everything's gonna be fine,
okay?

23:07.066 --> 23:08.099
I promise.

23:13.973 --> 23:16.073
Ty:
You want me to take a photo?

23:16.141 --> 23:17.542
Amy:
What? Like a...

23:17.609 --> 23:19.710
A last picture
just in case?

23:21.179 --> 23:23.948
No, Amy,
that's not what I meant.

23:25.083 --> 23:27.618
Scott:
We're ready for Spartan.

23:29.922 --> 23:30.887
Scott, do you mind
taking a picture

23:30.955 --> 23:32.889
of the three of us?

23:32.957 --> 23:33.990
Sure.

23:35.426 --> 23:36.460
Big smiles.

23:38.529 --> 23:41.164
(Shutter snaps)

23:41.231 --> 23:42.466
Here you go.

23:42.533 --> 23:43.900
Thank you.

23:45.035 --> 23:46.069
(Sighs heavily)

23:48.404 --> 23:49.805
(Hooves clip clop)

23:50.774 --> 23:53.075
I'll be waiting
right here.

24:00.350 --> 24:01.450
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Ty!</i>

24:02.718 --> 24:04.452
Ty, Spartan's gone!

24:04.520 --> 24:06.855
Ty:
Amy, I think it's Spartan!

24:06.922 --> 24:08.255
Auctioneer:
(Calls the bid)

24:08.323 --> 24:09.823
Ty, that's him.

24:09.891 --> 24:11.124
Auctioneer: (Gavel bangs)
And sold the horse.

24:11.192 --> 24:13.393
Stop it!
You're hurting him!

24:13.461 --> 24:14.928
This is my horse!
You can't...

24:14.996 --> 24:17.197
Rick, I'll buy him back
from you!

24:17.264 --> 24:20.534
<i>He was all I had left</i>
<i>of her.</i>

24:20.602 --> 24:21.602
Your mom?

24:24.105 --> 24:26.439
She died trying
to save him.

24:27.708 --> 24:29.709
Now it's like he's dead too.

24:29.776 --> 24:30.810
<i>There he is!</i>

24:30.878 --> 24:32.979
(Spartan whinnies shrilly)

24:33.947 --> 24:35.415
It's okay, boy. Easy.

24:35.483 --> 24:36.449
Easy.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.151
(Spartan whinnies anxiously)

24:38.219 --> 24:40.686
(Loud bang)
Spartan! Whoa!

24:40.754 --> 24:42.787
(Spartan whinnies shrilly)

24:44.624 --> 24:45.657
<i>Spartan!</i>

24:49.462 --> 24:51.430
Please come back to me.

24:59.243 --> 25:00.944
<i>Jake:</i>
<i>How are you doin'?</i>

25:01.012 --> 25:03.345
Fine. Good. You?

25:03.413 --> 25:04.714
Great.

25:04.781 --> 25:05.948
I just got back from hunting
with my dad.

25:06.016 --> 25:07.717
Did you shoot anything?

25:07.784 --> 25:09.218
Jake:
No, we never do.

25:09.285 --> 25:12.154
It's just an excuse
to hang out.

25:12.222 --> 25:13.823
I called you yesterday.

25:14.791 --> 25:16.492
Oh...

25:16.560 --> 25:17.860
That was you?

25:17.928 --> 25:19.494
It wasn't a good time.

25:19.562 --> 25:22.296
How was your horse show?
Did you win?

25:22.364 --> 25:23.899
No.

25:23.966 --> 25:24.966
Jake: Well, it was your
first show, right?

25:25.034 --> 25:26.134
You survived.

25:27.770 --> 25:29.971
You can't sit here
unless you order something.

25:30.039 --> 25:31.199
Give me a menu
and I'll order.

25:34.576 --> 25:35.976
Sure.

25:36.044 --> 25:38.612
But I still can't
talk to you.

25:38.680 --> 25:41.081
I'm not allowed visitors
until my break.

25:41.149 --> 25:42.516
I'll wait.

25:47.255 --> 25:49.222
Lou:
This was my first championship.

25:53.794 --> 25:57.062
"Pony Hunter, 1992."

26:01.969 --> 26:03.469
I like this one.

26:03.537 --> 26:05.672
"June 21st, 1997."

26:05.989 --> 26:08.523
The spring into summer show
at Paramount.

26:08.590 --> 26:10.758
I won a halter
and a cooler.

26:10.827 --> 26:11.759
Hmm.

26:11.828 --> 26:13.394
That was my last show.

26:13.462 --> 26:14.629
Why?

26:14.697 --> 26:16.397
Did something happen
to you?

26:16.465 --> 26:18.033
<i>Lou: Not to me, to my dad.</i>

26:18.968 --> 26:22.301
Um, my dad was a bull-dogger,
a steer wrestler.

26:23.604 --> 26:26.773
All-round cowboy
four years in a row.

26:26.842 --> 26:28.209
Kind of a living legend.

26:28.276 --> 26:29.877
Your dad was a legend?

26:29.945 --> 26:31.045
Don't mention it to him

26:31.112 --> 26:32.552
or he'll tell you
about his fan club.

26:33.114 --> 26:35.149
Okay, so, what happened?

26:36.551 --> 26:39.884
Well, it was Super Sunday
at the Calgary Stampede

26:41.388 --> 26:44.190
and the steer comes flying
out of the chute

26:44.258 --> 26:47.591
and my dad and Pegasus,
that was his horse,

26:47.962 --> 26:49.662
they're right on the money.

26:49.730 --> 26:51.597
And my dad leans over
to grab the horns,

26:51.665 --> 26:52.832
and the steer...

26:53.868 --> 26:56.836
He changes directions
and cuts him off.

26:56.903 --> 26:58.604
And then?

26:58.672 --> 26:59.772
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>And then...</i>

26:59.840 --> 27:02.441
They set up a tent
so that we couldn't see.

27:02.509 --> 27:04.543
Did the horse die?

27:04.611 --> 27:07.680
No, my mom made
sure of that,

27:07.748 --> 27:09.515
but he was never
the same again

27:09.583 --> 27:12.083
and neither was my family.

27:12.150 --> 27:14.919
<i>My dad,</i>
<i>he, he moved away.</i>

27:14.987 --> 27:18.320
It was like I didn't even
have a dad anymore.

27:18.591 --> 27:20.692
It broke my heart.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.761
And me, I didn't even
sit on a horse again

27:22.828 --> 27:26.161
until I moved back to Alberta
after my mom died.

27:27.599 --> 27:29.633
So, Georgie...
(Sighs)

27:29.701 --> 27:32.736
Do you understand
why I'm telling you all this?

27:32.804 --> 27:34.738
Yeah.

27:34.806 --> 27:38.139
Because you understand why
I don't want to jump again.

27:41.813 --> 27:43.179
Mallory:
Hey. Hi.

27:44.147 --> 27:45.448
How's Spartan?

27:45.516 --> 27:47.082
He's still in surgery.

27:47.150 --> 27:48.384
That's good.

27:48.452 --> 27:51.454
I mean, it's good
that they can do surgery.

27:51.522 --> 27:52.288
Look, Amy...

27:52.355 --> 27:53.423
No, Mallory, stop.

27:53.490 --> 27:54.657
Please just
let me finish!

27:54.725 --> 27:58.058
I don't want coffee!
We're just here for lunch.

27:58.529 --> 27:59.461
Okay.

27:59.529 --> 28:00.862
Lunch, that's great.

28:00.930 --> 28:04.132
Okay, um, on special
is cajun chicken paninis.

28:04.199 --> 28:06.868
Uh, you can get a side of salad
or yam fries.

28:06.936 --> 28:08.837
Yam fries are $1.99
extra though.

28:08.905 --> 28:12.238
How about a chicken club?
That's always a good bet.

28:12.542 --> 28:13.909
Yeah, make that two.

28:13.976 --> 28:16.143
Okay, two chicken clubs.
I'll get right on that.

28:16.210 --> 28:18.378
(Gasps,
dishes shatter)

28:18.447 --> 28:20.414
<i>Waitress:</i>
<i>Careful!</i>

28:21.382 --> 28:22.483
I'm so sorry.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.620
(Tearful)
I'm so sorry about everything!

28:29.891 --> 28:31.925
I better go have
a chat with her.

28:31.992 --> 28:33.526
Jake:
Excuse me, Mr. Bartlett,

28:33.594 --> 28:36.095
but I might be the best person
to handle this situation.

28:43.971 --> 28:45.004
Jake:
Mallory.

28:46.006 --> 28:47.973
Give me those.

28:48.040 --> 28:49.174
Give those back!

28:49.192 --> 28:50.802
I'm sorry, but you're in
no condition to drive.

28:50.810 --> 28:52.745
- What?!
- You're acting weird.

28:52.812 --> 28:54.079
You're not yourself.

28:54.146 --> 28:56.615
This is my new self,
my pathetic self!

28:56.683 --> 28:57.716
Jake:
You're not pathetic.

28:57.784 --> 28:59.050
Oh? So then what
do you call

28:59.118 --> 29:02.388
my pathetic crush on Jeremy,
if not pathetic?

29:02.455 --> 29:03.821
Who's Jeremy?

29:03.889 --> 29:05.923
My so-called coach.

29:05.991 --> 29:09.324
I was working extra shifts
just to pay for his lessons

29:10.028 --> 29:13.361
(Tearful) And the whole time
he was just using me!

29:13.665 --> 29:15.232
And the most pathetic part

29:15.300 --> 29:17.602
was walking in on him
and Cassandra making out.

29:17.669 --> 29:19.303
It's all I could think about
when I was in the ring,

29:19.371 --> 29:21.304
even with my mantra.

29:21.372 --> 29:22.472
Mantra?

29:22.540 --> 29:25.208
"True hearts
can't be broken."

29:25.276 --> 29:28.278
(Tearful) Well, they can
and mine was.

29:30.214 --> 29:33.082
It's okay...
It's okay.

29:34.051 --> 29:35.351
It's not!

29:38.087 --> 29:41.420
Spartan fell
and broke his leg.

29:41.525 --> 29:43.893
Is he gonna be okay?

29:43.960 --> 29:45.795
I don't know.

29:45.862 --> 29:48.230
But if he isn't,
Amy's gonna hate me forever.

29:48.298 --> 29:49.799
I mean, anyone would.

29:49.866 --> 29:52.133
Amy's not anyone.

29:57.239 --> 29:58.673
(Cell phone rings)

30:00.108 --> 30:02.076
Grandpa, wait up.

30:02.144 --> 30:03.545
Ty.

30:04.580 --> 30:05.947
Yeah, I'll be right there.

30:06.014 --> 30:08.449
It's Spartan.
We've gotta go.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.994
<i>Me?</i>
<i>Oh, I'm doin' okay.</i>

30:15.397 --> 30:16.664
I'm missing you.

30:17.765 --> 30:18.799
(Chuckles)

30:20.634 --> 30:23.503
No, no, there's nothing
you can do.

30:24.772 --> 30:27.340
No, I think
everything'll be fine.

30:28.743 --> 30:31.912
Yeah, well, yes,
you could always do that.

30:32.879 --> 30:35.347
Of course,
then I'd probably have to...

30:35.415 --> 30:38.150
I gotta go, gotta go.
Okay, talk to you later. Bye.

30:38.218 --> 30:39.185
(Phone beeps off)

30:39.252 --> 30:40.586
Hi, Lou.

30:40.653 --> 30:41.687
Oh, thanks.

30:41.755 --> 30:42.688
Who was that?

30:42.756 --> 30:43.789
Nobody.

30:45.759 --> 30:47.559
How's the kid?

30:47.627 --> 30:49.627
Not great.

30:49.695 --> 30:51.229
I told her about your wreck
at the Stampede.

30:51.296 --> 30:53.331
I thought it might help.

30:53.398 --> 30:56.731
She was totally traumatized
by seeing Spartan go down.

30:57.019 --> 31:00.288
Nowadays, they call that
"post traumatic stress."

31:01.256 --> 31:03.792
In my day, they just said,
"Cowboy up. Get over it."

31:03.860 --> 31:05.325
It's sad.

31:05.393 --> 31:08.395
You know, Georgie and Phoenix
are a pretty amazing team.

31:08.463 --> 31:11.198
One of the great lessons
every cowboy learns is,

31:11.265 --> 31:12.800
no matter what,

31:12.868 --> 31:14.434
you gotta get back
on the horse.

31:14.503 --> 31:16.436
I know, I know,
and I'm working on a plan,

31:16.505 --> 31:17.471
but it's tricky

31:17.539 --> 31:19.874
because I'm new at this,
okay,

31:19.941 --> 31:21.508
and I just, I don't wanna
push her too hard.

31:21.575 --> 31:23.042
Come on, Lou.

31:23.110 --> 31:24.410
You know what's best
for her.

31:24.478 --> 31:26.513
I think I do.

31:26.580 --> 31:29.448
Then you gotta push,

31:29.517 --> 31:32.850
as hard as it takes
to get her there.

31:33.554 --> 31:36.055
(Sighs) Okay,
maybe I will.

31:36.123 --> 31:37.422
Thanks, Dad.

31:37.490 --> 31:38.957
Anytime.

31:41.193 --> 31:45.828
So you and "nobody" sound like you have
a pretty interesting relationship.

31:55.240 --> 31:56.473
Scott.

31:56.542 --> 31:58.442
His eyes are open.

31:58.510 --> 32:01.579
Scott: Lean on his neck.
Easy does it.

32:02.948 --> 32:04.448
Scott, can I come in there?

32:04.516 --> 32:05.883
You can't, Amy,
it's too dangerous.

32:05.951 --> 32:07.952
Please.

32:08.020 --> 32:09.318
Ty: (Spartan snorts awake) Whoa!

32:09.386 --> 32:11.521
(Spartan snorts loudly)

32:11.589 --> 32:13.089
Whoa, boy.

32:13.157 --> 32:14.157
<i>Easy.</i>

32:15.426 --> 32:16.626
<i>Easy.</i>

32:16.694 --> 32:18.227
(Spartan snorts)

32:19.196 --> 32:21.230
Scott, he's really trying
to get up now.

32:21.298 --> 32:23.733
Okay, we're gonna let him,
but slowly.

32:25.001 --> 32:27.402
<i>Scott: Ready?</i>
<i>Ty: Yeah.</i>

32:27.470 --> 32:29.004
(Spartan whinnies)

32:34.010 --> 32:36.178
(Spartan shrieks in pain)

32:36.245 --> 32:38.547
(Spartan snorts erratically)

32:38.615 --> 32:39.982
<i>Easy, easy.</i>

Yup, the world is

34:06.664 --> 34:07.764
I would call it
the elephant in the room,

an elephant,

<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Well, I have,</i>

34:20.777 --> 34:22.978
and the way I see it,
you have three options.

34:23.045 --> 34:25.681
Option one:
Back in the saddle.

34:25.715 --> 34:27.081
Fine, but no jumping.

34:27.183 --> 34:29.583
Not fine - not for a horse
who loves to jump.

34:29.652 --> 34:31.853
Which brings us
to option two:

34:31.888 --> 34:33.453
Find someone else
who will jump him for you.

34:33.554 --> 34:36.857
No! It's too dangerous!
You know what can happen.

34:36.891 --> 34:39.393
Lou: All right, then that
leaves us with option three:

34:39.460 --> 34:40.795
Put him up for sale.

<i>Georgie:</i>
<i>No! You can't do that, okay?!</i>

34:42.597 --> 34:44.464

it's only temporary.

35:06.652 --> 35:08.253
Georgie:
Right.

35:08.321 --> 35:09.487
Now.

35:12.425 --> 35:15.427
You can go play
with your fiends now, okay?

35:15.494 --> 35:16.461

<i>Georgie:</i>
<i>I know but...</i>

35:56.332 --> 35:57.733

you get from selling him.

36:01.237 --> 36:04.072
Thanks but no thanks.
Not worth it.

36:04.140 --> 36:05.940
Are you kidding?
You've seen him jump.

36:06.008 --> 36:07.376
He's amazing!

36:07.443 --> 36:08.910
Well, I thought
his jumpin' days were over.

36:08.978 --> 36:11.946
Didn't I hear you say that?
So that leaves what?

36:12.014 --> 36:13.448
I don't know.
