Harper:
<i> Previously on "Secrets
 of Sulphur Springs"...</i>

00:02.170 --> 00:03.420
For the first time
in my life,

00:03.420 --> 00:05.040
I have a mom and dad
who love me.

00:05.040 --> 00:06.000
I can't leave here.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.330
I just had an idea.

00:07.330 --> 00:10.000
This was inside
an old coffee can

00:10.000 --> 00:11.960
<i> Savannah and I used
 to pass messages.</i>

00:11.960 --> 00:14.540
She's out there
just living her life.

00:14.540 --> 00:16.580
Change of plans, Griff.
We decided to stay.

00:16.580 --> 00:18.170
Harper:
<i> Don't you ever think about
 what things would be like</i>

00:18.170 --> 00:19.670
if Dad hadn't died
in that crash?

00:19.670 --> 00:20.710
Wouldn't it be amazing

00:20.710 --> 00:22.750
if we could go back
and change things?

00:22.750 --> 00:23.580
Of course it would.

00:24.750 --> 00:26.790
Hey, what's up?
You need some help?

00:30.960 --> 00:33.420
Before I know it,
I'm flying over the handlebars,

00:33.420 --> 00:35.750
and I'm thinking,
"Where did that
dumb log come from?"

00:35.750 --> 00:37.380
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down now.

00:37.380 --> 00:38.250
So where's the bike?

00:38.830 --> 00:40.170
Left it by the creek.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.880
Bent frame.
Chain's in a knot.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.330
I was wondering

00:43.330 --> 00:44.920
if I could get
a ride back into town.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.250
Didn't your daddy
ever tell you

00:46.250 --> 00:47.710
not to accept rides
from strangers?

00:48.540 --> 00:50.500
Actually, you're
not really a stranger.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.420
Uh, my mom
knows your wife.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.790
You're Mr. Dunn, right?

00:55.540 --> 00:58.040
My dad's Mr. Dunn.
You can call me Chris.

00:58.620 --> 01:01.380
-And you are?
-Marie... Granger.

01:01.380 --> 01:02.670
Marie?

01:03.920 --> 01:05.080
That's my mother's name.

01:05.920 --> 01:06.830
How about that?

01:08.420 --> 01:09.790
Hop on in, Marie Granger.

01:15.290 --> 01:17.540
Oh, you really don't want
to take Bayou Road.

01:18.170 --> 01:19.580
I don't?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.250
It's closed up ahead.

01:21.250 --> 01:23.420
You should take
Sugar Hill instead.

01:23.420 --> 01:24.670
It's faster too.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.210
If you insist.

01:34.500 --> 01:35.960
I come out here
every Sunday.

01:36.790 --> 01:39.000
Drive around
the old Tremont property.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.460
Don't tell anyone,
but I'm planning to buy it.

01:41.460 --> 01:42.710
You are?

01:44.040 --> 01:45.790
I mean, that old place?

01:45.790 --> 01:47.960
Why-- Why would you
want to buy The Tremont?

01:47.960 --> 01:50.080
The land was owned
by my family for generations,

01:50.920 --> 01:52.330
even before
it was a hotel.

01:53.040 --> 01:54.670
Just a farm back then.

01:55.290 --> 01:56.460
Sugar cane mostly.

01:57.710 --> 02:00.330
-Look out!
-(horn blaring)

02:00.710 --> 02:01.920
(sighs in relief)

02:03.250 --> 02:04.460
That was close.

02:04.460 --> 02:05.580
Thanks.

02:06.380 --> 02:07.880
Guess it's
what I'm here for.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.539
Oh, there's Sugar Hill.

02:17.170 --> 02:20.120

03:16.620 --> 03:18.040
You're really good, Dad.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.460
It's been a while,
hasn't it?

03:19.460 --> 03:20.920
Yeah, it feels like forever.

03:21.380 --> 03:23.790
Okay, check this out.

03:23.790 --> 03:26.460
Prepare to be amazed.

Gah! Dang!

03:39.460 --> 03:40.500
I always mess up there.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.960
'Course when you're on a stage

03:42.960 --> 03:45.460
in front of a bunch of campers
and your father...

03:45.460 --> 03:47.170
Is that the same song
you won the trophy for?

03:47.170 --> 03:49.250
Yeah, with the same mistake
and all.

03:49.250 --> 03:50.920
I still have no idea
how I won.

03:51.790 --> 03:54.580
You know, maybe
they stuffed the ballot box.

03:55.580 --> 03:57.420
I remember thinking
the exact same thing.

03:58.170 --> 04:00.580
Well, it's good old
Camp Tremont.

04:01.380 --> 04:03.210
You know, I had a dream
about it last night.

04:04.710 --> 04:05.960
I was 12.

04:06.710 --> 04:09.330
Everything was
exactly the same except...

04:10.120 --> 04:11.040
you were there.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.670
Me? Uh... really?

04:14.670 --> 04:18.120
Yeah. We were hanging out
in one of the bunkhouses,

04:18.120 --> 04:19.420
and talking about...

04:20.380 --> 04:21.500
I don't know, who-knows-what.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.210
Then I woke up.

04:26.170 --> 04:27.750
Hmm. That's...

04:27.750 --> 04:29.120
It's weird.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.710
Yeah, it kinda was.

04:36.620 --> 04:38.580
I hope I'm not keeping you
from your family.

04:38.580 --> 04:40.040
My dad said
he'd be here soon.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.080
No worries.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.710
I've got some time
till we go out to the lake.

04:43.710 --> 04:45.540
The-- the lake?

04:45.540 --> 04:46.880
My other
Sunday tradition.

04:47.540 --> 04:49.710
When the weather's nice,
I take the family
for a picnic.

04:49.710 --> 04:51.540
Thought it'd be
the perfect time

04:51.540 --> 04:54.000
for me to tell them
about my plan
to buy the place.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.710
-Your wife doesn't know?
-No.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.540
I didn't want
to get her hopes all up

04:57.540 --> 04:59.040
until I had the money
to get it started.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.710
It's going to be
such a great place
for the kids.

05:03.210 --> 05:05.210
So, how old
are your kids?

05:05.210 --> 05:07.040
Well, there's Harper.
She's four.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.210
And Toph is three.

05:09.330 --> 05:10.920
Harper's my little artist,

05:11.580 --> 05:14.040
and Topher, he's turning
into the family comedian.

05:15.330 --> 05:17.920
So the idea is to move
into The Tremont
when you buy it?

05:18.670 --> 05:21.500
I used to work summers
at the hotel when I was a kid.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.290
It's where
I met my wife.

05:23.290 --> 05:24.170
Jess.

05:26.170 --> 05:28.000
She was a camper,
and I'd help out
the bellhops

05:28.000 --> 05:29.670
or whoever else
that needed me.

05:29.670 --> 05:31.290
Heard The Tremont
has a ghost.

05:31.290 --> 05:32.710
Hoo-hoo-hoo, yeah.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.040
Savannah Dillon?
(chuckles)

05:36.880 --> 05:39.210
Hmm. Don't tell me
you believe that stuff.

05:39.210 --> 05:40.790
Oh, well, I did.

05:40.790 --> 05:42.290
I mean, I used to.

05:42.290 --> 05:44.670
Listen, I've been
through that whole hotel.

05:44.670 --> 05:45.920
I didn't find any ghost.

05:48.710 --> 05:49.830
But that car of mine?

05:50.620 --> 05:51.880
'67 GTO.

05:52.710 --> 05:54.420
Restored it soup to nuts.

05:54.420 --> 05:55.960
And when I sell it,

05:55.960 --> 05:57.710
that'll be the money
I use for my down payment.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.380
Sorry. Like you care
about any of this.

06:01.380 --> 06:03.290
No. It's really cool.

06:03.290 --> 06:04.460
I definitely care.

06:07.210 --> 06:09.000
-What?
-It's-- it's just funny.

06:10.460 --> 06:12.380
You remind me
so much of my daughter.

06:13.170 --> 06:15.790
Oh, no.
Not an artistic bone
in my body.

06:17.750 --> 06:18.580
Hmm.

06:20.830 --> 06:22.920
Well, I should get back
to the tribe.

06:22.920 --> 06:23.920
I don't want to be late.

06:24.710 --> 06:26.120
You sure your dad
is on his way?

06:26.120 --> 06:27.620
Be here any second.

06:35.330 --> 06:36.920
It was really nice
meeting you, Marie.

06:36.920 --> 06:37.920
Um...

06:40.790 --> 06:42.290
Um, it was just a ride.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.040
Uh, I know. Sorry.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.670
I just get silly sometimes.

06:47.500 --> 06:48.670
Well, Miss Silly Marie,

06:49.580 --> 06:51.670
I'm guessing we'll be
running into each other again.

06:51.670 --> 06:52.830
Counting on it.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.000
Wyatt?

07:08.670 --> 07:09.750
Where are you?

07:12.040 --> 07:12.880
Wyatt?

07:17.830 --> 07:19.790
-What are you doing?
-Shh.

07:21.250 --> 07:22.580
It started rocking...

07:22.580 --> 07:24.210
all by itself.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.120
Come here.
Sit down.

07:26.790 --> 07:27.750
Watch.

07:29.830 --> 07:31.380
-I really don't think--
-Shh.

07:32.330 --> 07:33.380
You're gonna scare it.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.290
(creaking)

07:43.040 --> 07:44.620
Just like before.

07:44.620 --> 07:45.580
Savannah...

07:46.580 --> 07:47.500
is it you?

07:48.120 --> 07:50.120
(eerie music playing)

07:58.460 --> 08:00.380
I think I'm gonna need my hat.

08:07.290 --> 08:08.540
-Hey!
-Oh!

08:08.540 --> 08:09.620
There you are.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.460
-How did you find me?
-I was looking for you.

08:11.460 --> 08:13.540
To tell you that
we're not moving,
after all.

08:13.540 --> 08:15.750
And then I noticed
that the tumblers
on the radio

08:15.750 --> 08:17.420
were set to 2011.

08:17.420 --> 08:18.750
The year that
your dad died.

08:18.750 --> 08:20.380
I saved him, Griffin.

08:20.380 --> 08:21.790
I saved my father
from the car accident.

08:21.790 --> 08:23.000
That...

08:23.000 --> 08:24.250
That's--
That's incredible.

08:24.250 --> 08:25.460
How?
What happened?

08:25.460 --> 08:27.000
I got in his car
with him.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.620
There was this truck
headed right for us.

08:30.250 --> 08:32.500
I warned him,
and he avoided the wreck.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.080
We took a short cut
into town.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.960
And then we had coffee
at my mom's place.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.330
Only it wasn't Dunn's.
It was some other name.

08:38.330 --> 08:39.880
But get this!

08:39.880 --> 08:41.789
My dad's dream
was to buy The Tremont.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.169
And why?

08:43.169 --> 08:44.540
Because it was
in his family

08:44.540 --> 08:45.750
years and years ago.

08:45.750 --> 08:46.960
But how could you
not know this?

08:46.960 --> 08:48.080
I mean, before now.

08:48.080 --> 08:49.500
My mom never talked
about it.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.120
Maybe she didn't know.

08:52.120 --> 08:54.040
He was planning
to surprise her
the day he died.

08:54.710 --> 08:56.790
I know what you're thinking.
You're worried.

08:57.420 --> 09:00.250
I messed with destiny,
changed things.

09:00.250 --> 09:02.960
But I'm telling you, Griffin,
when we get back,

09:02.960 --> 09:04.460
my dad will still be alive,

09:04.460 --> 09:05.960
waiting at home for me.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.540
And everything
will be all right.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.120
You'll see.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.380
We're going to find
a whole new world up there.

09:24.580 --> 09:26.000
(door opens)

09:39.750 --> 09:41.420
It's all the same.

09:41.420 --> 09:43.920
Okay, then he didn't buy it.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.920
Probably bought
the coffee shop instead.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.290
He'll be at home.

09:49.210 --> 09:51.960
Harper, come on.
I mean, what if he--

09:51.960 --> 09:53.420
Why are you doubting this?

09:53.420 --> 09:55.670
For once, why can't you
just be happy for me?

10:15.380 --> 10:16.420
Dad?

10:17.670 --> 10:18.540
Dad?

10:20.710 --> 10:21.790
Dad?

10:25.210 --> 10:26.080
Dad?

10:35.500 --> 10:36.420
Dad?

10:38.500 --> 10:40.040
(footsteps approach)

10:41.500 --> 10:43.830
Did you just say, "Dad"?

10:44.670 --> 10:45.620
Yes, I did.

10:46.620 --> 10:49.330
Yeah. I've been thinking
about him too.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.170
Today's the anniversary of...

10:52.170 --> 10:53.540
the accident.

11:02.460 --> 11:03.330
(door closes)

11:07.710 --> 11:08.960
(knocking on door)

11:09.670 --> 11:11.000
Topher:
Harper...

11:11.000 --> 11:12.170
you okay?

11:12.960 --> 11:14.330
Yeah, Toph, I'm fine.

11:15.210 --> 11:16.500
I just need some time.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.290
Scare what?

12:44.080 --> 12:45.750
And why
is this rocking chair
in my room?

12:46.170 --> 12:47.670
We brought it in
to keep an eye on it.

12:48.460 --> 12:49.880
This is a stake-out.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.750
There's a ghost.

12:51.750 --> 12:52.920
Guys, come on,

12:52.920 --> 12:54.710
I thought we were done
with all this ghost stuff.

12:54.710 --> 12:57.540
-We saw the chair rock.
-Twice.

12:57.540 --> 12:58.790
In Mom and Dad's room.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.170
By itself.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.080
-Savannah?
-We thought that too.

13:06.830 --> 13:09.710
But when we asked,
"Are you Savannah?"

13:10.330 --> 13:11.710
It wrote
on the mirror again.

13:12.460 --> 13:13.290
Wrote what?

13:14.040 --> 13:15.210
N-O.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.380
Noooo.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.670
So we think
it's someone else.

13:20.670 --> 13:23.170
Someone who likes
rocking chairs.

13:24.710 --> 13:25.880
Sit with us.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.210
Help us watch.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.880
But just so you know,
it only comes out...

13:33.710 --> 13:35.330
when you're really...

13:35.330 --> 13:36.460
really quiet.

13:42.670 --> 13:43.790
Topher:
Harper, wait!

13:43.790 --> 13:44.880
What are you
talking about?

13:45.750 --> 13:48.170
I remembered.
It all came back.

13:49.580 --> 13:50.460
What?

13:51.670 --> 13:53.710
Our dad didn't die
on Bayou Road.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.670
It wasn't
a car accident.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.120
Oh, my poor baby.

13:59.460 --> 14:01.620
We were at the lake.

14:02.620 --> 14:03.710
Our canoe went over.

14:05.290 --> 14:07.330
I held on,
but Dad didn't.

14:08.670 --> 14:10.080
And I blocked it all out,
didn't I?

14:11.080 --> 14:12.580
The whole day. All of it.

14:14.250 --> 14:15.620
Yes, baby, you did.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.750
The doctors...
They said not to tell you,

14:19.750 --> 14:21.120
not to force things,

14:21.120 --> 14:23.330
that it would all
come back on its own.

14:24.210 --> 14:26.290
But you told me
it was a car accident.

14:26.290 --> 14:28.790
Oh, sweetie,
you woke up one morning

14:28.790 --> 14:30.460
and you said
it was a car accident.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.620
And for the first time
in forever, you seemed so...

14:35.750 --> 14:37.040
at peace.

14:38.710 --> 14:40.380
I figured it was
the closure you needed.

14:42.210 --> 14:44.620
That's why you always said
The Tremont was cursed.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.290
Because that's where
we lost him.

14:48.460 --> 14:50.580
In that lake,
on The Tremont property.

14:52.250 --> 14:54.580
And after that,
I never wanted
either of you

14:54.580 --> 14:55.960
anywhere near that place.

14:56.710 --> 14:58.080
Because bad things
happen there.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.790
Did you know
it was Dad's dream
to buy it?

15:05.040 --> 15:07.080
I knew it had been
in his family,

15:07.080 --> 15:08.920
that he liked
to go out there, but...

15:08.920 --> 15:10.420
buy The Tremont?

15:12.040 --> 15:14.580
-No, he never told me that.
-He was gonna fix it up.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.580
Move in.

15:17.710 --> 15:19.920
Baby, how could you
possibly know that?

15:21.040 --> 15:22.250
I don't know.

15:22.250 --> 15:23.750
Maybe I made that up too.

15:25.290 --> 15:27.210
Whatever happened
to his yellow convertible?

15:28.420 --> 15:29.920
I sold it.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.460
For a down payment
on the coffee shop.

15:33.620 --> 15:34.830
It's where we had
our first date.

15:36.670 --> 15:37.960
And a lot of dates
after that.

15:42.540 --> 15:43.500
You okay, baby?

15:44.710 --> 15:45.880
Yeah, I am.

15:46.540 --> 15:47.540
I am now.

15:48.670 --> 15:50.170
Finally, it all makes sense.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.120
(Wyatt sighs)

16:08.380 --> 16:09.380
I'm hungry.

16:11.580 --> 16:13.500
Can you watch it
while we go get
something to eat?

16:14.290 --> 16:15.580
If you make me
something too.

16:16.620 --> 16:17.620
Peanut butter and jelly?

16:18.500 --> 16:19.670
Yeah, that works.

16:21.120 --> 16:23.670
Great. It's the only thing
we know how to make.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.210
(rocking chair creaks)

16:37.330 --> 16:39.750
(tense music playing)

16:44.710 --> 16:47.380
(music continues)

16:59.210 --> 17:01.380
(music continues)

17:14.619 --> 17:17.420
(music continues)

17:29.290 --> 17:31.710
(music continues)

17:43.880 --> 17:45.080
Harper?

17:46.460 --> 17:48.460
I-- I tried reaching you--

17:51.580 --> 17:53.250
Your dad's still gone.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.620
He didn't die
in a car accident.

17:56.830 --> 17:57.790
My mother just told me.

17:59.290 --> 18:01.330
After it happened,
I blocked it out.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.210
Came up with
the car accident.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.540
But... what actually happened...

18:07.540 --> 18:08.540
was he drowned.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.670
The same day but later.

18:10.670 --> 18:13.670
So even if I wanted
to go back, it's too late.

18:13.670 --> 18:15.040
I'm sorry.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.750
Griffin, I started
to think about it,

18:17.750 --> 18:19.380
all you've said.

18:19.380 --> 18:20.960
No, no. I--
I shouldn't have.

18:21.960 --> 18:23.380
I should have just
kept my mouth shut.

18:23.380 --> 18:25.920
But you were right.
We can't change things.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.790
And we shouldn't try to,
ever again.

18:29.420 --> 18:31.040
The truth is...

18:31.040 --> 18:32.460
my father died
so I could live.

18:33.670 --> 18:34.920
He died saving me.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.500
That's what was
supposed to happen.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.210
Maybe we should close it up.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.500
Yeah.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.880
(whooshing)

18:44.580 --> 18:45.460
It's cold.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.040
Do you feel that?

18:49.670 --> 18:50.920
Where did those come from?

18:50.920 --> 18:53.040
Oh, the rocking chair
upstairs.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.380
It was rocking by itself

18:54.380 --> 18:56.540
and then
whatever was rocking in it

18:56.540 --> 18:58.040
came down here.

18:58.620 --> 18:59.710
Wet footprints.

18:59.710 --> 19:01.290
My father died in a lake.

19:01.290 --> 19:02.880
(objects clattering)

19:02.880 --> 19:04.620
-(Griffin exclaiming)
-Hey, guys.

19:05.620 --> 19:06.920
-Miss me?
-Griffin: Savannah!

19:06.920 --> 19:09.040
You said you were never
coming through the portal,

19:09.040 --> 19:10.460
that you've found your family.

19:10.460 --> 19:11.620
I know. I know.

19:12.330 --> 19:13.460
But then I found this.

19:15.330 --> 19:16.710
Looks like you're not done
time traveling either.

19:19.210 --> 19:21.210
(intense music playing)

19:23.080 --> 19:25.710
My folks had me
clearing out
this storage room.

19:25.710 --> 19:27.710
It was sealed
in an envelope
in a crack in the wall,

19:27.710 --> 19:29.170
I'm guessing, by you.

19:30.750 --> 19:32.420
Griffin:
W-Wait, back up.

19:32.420 --> 19:34.000
Savannah:
What are you not
understanding?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.580
It's like what we did
with the coffee can.

19:35.580 --> 19:37.460
You did the same thing.

19:37.460 --> 19:40.000
Went back to 1930,
put on those clothes,

19:40.000 --> 19:41.040
got your picture taken,

19:41.040 --> 19:42.790
and then left it
for us to find.

19:42.790 --> 19:44.380
But why?

19:45.000 --> 19:46.620
Why would I go back to 1930?

19:46.620 --> 19:49.540
Maybe because The Tremont
is in your family.

19:49.540 --> 19:51.620
It has to be
connected somehow.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.960
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

19:54.670 --> 19:57.330
I mean... unless you have
somewhere else to go.

19:59.210 --> 20:00.460
As long as we're home
before dinner.

20:06.790 --> 20:08.290
We'll pick up clothes
on the other side

20:08.290 --> 20:09.330
so we don't stick out.

20:09.330 --> 20:10.790
This is really cool.

20:10.790 --> 20:13.790
Yeah. Finally, an adventure
that doesn't involve
saving you.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.000
So that's how you do it.

20:17.830 --> 20:19.290
How did you
ever figure that out?

20:19.290 --> 20:21.250
It was
really weird.

20:21.250 --> 20:23.040
We're still not
exactly sure
how it works.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.170
We might've gotten
a little help
from the other side.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.710
So a ghost
that's not me.

20:28.670 --> 20:31.120
-Who do you think it is?
-It could be anyone.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.330
I followed
those wet footprints
down to the basement.

20:34.330 --> 20:36.580
It's like it was
reaching out,

20:36.580 --> 20:37.960
like it was
pointing the way.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.420
This is really spooky,

20:40.170 --> 20:42.080
but, like,
good kind of spooky.

20:42.750 --> 20:44.250
All set. 1930.

20:44.250 --> 20:46.500
(radio whirring.
electricity crackling)

20:46.500 --> 20:47.790
Harper: Let's go.

20:55.290 --> 20:56.670
Wow!

21:10.670 --> 21:12.080
Griffin:
Savannah, wait!

21:14.210 --> 21:15.040
Ow!

21:21.750 --> 21:24.210
(birds chirping)

21:43.670 --> 21:44.920
There's no rust.

21:46.830 --> 21:48.540
Welcome to 1930, guys.

21:49.830 --> 21:51.210
So cool.

21:51.210 --> 21:52.380
Epic.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.540
(horse neighing)

22:00.330 --> 22:02.080
(rooster crowing)

22:03.620 --> 22:06.040
Remember, guys,
we're just here
to check it out.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.790
Stay together
and out of sight.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.330
You guys
see anything?

22:28.330 --> 22:29.920
(sighs) Nothing.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.210
It's too dark.

22:33.580 --> 22:35.080
Maybe the door's unlocked.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.500
Well, shouldn't
we knock first?

22:36.500 --> 22:37.580
Not dressed like this.

22:52.170 --> 22:53.000
Whoa!

22:58.040 --> 22:59.120
Where's the lobby?

23:00.960 --> 23:02.580
Guess it was added later

23:02.580 --> 23:04.290
when they turned
this place into a hotel.

23:04.290 --> 23:06.960
(jazz music playing)

23:08.040 --> 23:09.540
Where's that music coming from?

23:11.920 --> 23:13.080
Let's go.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.330
(music continues)

23:31.540 --> 23:34.040
(music continues)

23:52.330 --> 23:54.790
(music continues)

24:02.540 --> 24:04.290
That's the radio
from the bunker.

24:07.250 --> 24:08.380
Well...

24:09.540 --> 24:10.540
what do we do now?

24:10.540 --> 24:13.040
(creaking overhead)

24:13.040 --> 24:14.710
(footsteps)

24:16.120 --> 24:17.170
Upstairs.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.500
(tense music playing)

24:37.330 --> 24:38.960
(floorboard creaks)

24:41.380 --> 24:43.380
-Go, go, go, go!
-Griffin: Hurry up!

24:44.170 --> 24:45.330
Go!

24:48.830 --> 24:50.920
-(Harper gasps)
-(gasps)
