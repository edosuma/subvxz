<i> -Previously on</i> The Resident...
-Mom, we need to get you
back to Chastain.

00:04.079 --> 00:07.655
Your mother has lung cancer.
You cannot come

00:07.675 --> 00:09.491
to Nigeria with me.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.659
-I do want your job.
-I wouldn't want
a resident who didn't.

00:11.754 --> 00:14.179
We're cut from the same cloth.
No hidden agendas.

00:14.331 --> 00:17.090
There have been some
developments in gene therapy.

00:17.243 --> 00:19.685
Recent clinical trials
with good outcomes.

00:19.912 --> 00:21.245
These are uncharted waters.

00:21.263 --> 00:23.689
A lot of hospitals won't
risk hosting our trials.

00:23.916 --> 00:25.524
It's gonna be a long, hard road.

00:25.675 --> 00:27.100
-And nothing is
guaranteed, Rose.
-But I have a chance?

00:27.194 --> 00:28.510
Well, you have more than just

00:28.529 --> 00:31.346
a chance,
you have a damn good chance.

I am. I was also
just enjoying the view.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.110
Okay.

00:53.128 --> 00:55.054
But your mani-pedi appointment

00:55.205 --> 00:57.281
is on the other side of town
from your pregnancy message.

00:57.299 --> 00:59.707
We got to plan it out if we want
to hit everything today.

00:59.727 --> 01:00.967
You just finished a night shift.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.469
Are you sure
you're not too tired?

01:02.621 --> 01:04.879
To knock out
a pre-baby bucket list

01:04.973 --> 01:07.149
with my glowing wife?

01:08.718 --> 01:09.960
-Never.
-Mm.

01:10.053 --> 01:11.236
(Nic chuckles)

01:11.463 --> 01:14.222
You can say no if you want,
because it's your day.

01:14.316 --> 01:16.909
But what if we make
a pit stop at home?

01:17.136 --> 01:19.986
Someone told me alone time
will be hard to come by

01:20.081 --> 01:22.806
-once the baby is born.
-Hmm.

01:22.899 --> 01:24.658
I will definitely consider it.

01:24.810 --> 01:26.585
Mm, good.

01:26.736 --> 01:28.236
Then let's get
the hell out of here.

01:28.330 --> 01:31.072
Oh, you want to see
the new baby picture?

01:31.092 --> 01:32.740
Of course.

01:32.835 --> 01:34.927
Aw, another sonogram.

01:35.078 --> 01:35.928
-Let me see.
-(Nic laughs)

01:36.155 --> 01:37.838
Aw, it's a fat little potato

01:37.990 --> 01:39.414
with fists.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.841
Did you just call my child
a fat little potato?

01:40.935 --> 01:42.750
A cute, fat little potato.

01:42.845 --> 01:43.994
Thank you.

01:44.012 --> 01:45.104
I don't think that's
a compliment.

01:45.331 --> 01:46.921
No, I was thanking her
for helping

01:46.941 --> 01:48.440
-plan our day.
-A fabulous nail studio,

01:48.592 --> 01:51.593
a massage to die for
and I got you off the wait list

01:51.687 --> 01:53.854
at Marino's Steak House.
You have a table at 8:00.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.597
You are the best.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.949
Why don't you come meet us?

01:57.100 --> 01:59.176
No way. Conrad wants you
all to his lonesome.

01:59.194 --> 02:01.011
-Yes, I do.
-(Nic laughs)

02:01.029 --> 02:02.621
-And I'm here till midnight.
-Oh, God.

02:02.772 --> 02:04.181
Have fun.

02:05.351 --> 02:07.442
-No, no, no, no, no, no,
we're leaving.
-Wait, what's up?

02:07.461 --> 02:09.870
My shift is over
and you're on maternity leave.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.538
Hang on, what's going on?

02:11.690 --> 02:13.948
Mr. Goldense canceled
his appointment,

02:13.968 --> 02:15.283
third time this year.

02:15.302 --> 02:18.119
And I've called,
but it only goes to machine.

02:18.139 --> 02:19.880
You're the only one
he'll talk to.

02:20.032 --> 02:21.381
Nic, don't do it.

02:21.533 --> 02:24.034
(sighs) Oh, come on,
you know, Pete Goldense.

02:24.127 --> 02:25.869
History of A-fib.
He has cardiac meds

02:25.888 --> 02:27.204
that need close monitoring.

02:27.297 --> 02:29.398
We can go check it out.
It's not a problem.

02:30.592 --> 02:31.600
(elevator dings)

02:31.652 --> 02:32.876
You're impossible.

02:32.895 --> 02:33.801
It'll take two seconds.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.487
(exhales)
Okay.

02:35.639 --> 02:39.491
-(sighs)
-I wonder if it'll be this hard
to say no to our daughter.

02:39.643 --> 02:42.494
-Probably.
-Yep.

02:43.405 --> 02:45.739
Here's the problem, Dr. Voss.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.499
We're still far in the red,

02:47.726 --> 02:49.334
north of $25 million.

02:49.486 --> 02:51.986
Well, the numbers are trending
in the right direction.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.915
When I took over,
we were $35 million in the red.

02:55.067 --> 02:58.068
No one wants to put a price
on saving lives.

02:58.161 --> 02:59.994
But as CEO, you must.

03:00.014 --> 03:02.514
I am not like other CEOs.

03:02.666 --> 03:03.849
Which is why you hired me.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.667
And now we're beginning
to question the wisdom

03:05.761 --> 03:08.353
of putting someone with no
business experience at the helm.

03:10.082 --> 03:11.915
You need to find more cuts,
Dr. Voss.

03:11.934 --> 03:13.525
BOARD MEMBER:
And we don't mean pennies.

03:13.677 --> 03:14.918
We mean millions.

03:15.011 --> 03:18.197
This isn't coming from me
or the board, Kit.

03:18.424 --> 03:21.425
We're getting pressure
from the state.

03:21.443 --> 03:24.352
They have given us--
and by "us," I mean you--

03:24.371 --> 03:28.373
two weeks to come up
with big solutions.

03:31.954 --> 03:33.361
(knocking)

03:33.455 --> 03:34.755
(door opens)

03:36.608 --> 03:37.883
You okay?

03:38.034 --> 03:40.469
Come take a look at this.

03:44.466 --> 03:47.375
This was the scan
from my mother's diagnosis,

03:47.394 --> 03:49.877
when she was stage IV
with pleural mets.

03:49.897 --> 03:50.804
BELL:
Mm-hmm.

03:50.956 --> 03:52.547
And this...

03:52.566 --> 03:55.067
is today.

03:55.978 --> 03:57.961
Wow, that much progression?

03:58.054 --> 04:00.814
Her lung cancer
is highly aggressive.

04:00.966 --> 04:03.650
So sorry. I, um...

04:03.802 --> 04:05.226
Has she started chemo?

04:05.988 --> 04:08.822
She watched her father die
of cancer.

04:08.916 --> 04:12.142
She remembers vomiting
and constant nausea.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.144
He was in pain for months
until he died.

04:14.162 --> 04:17.047
She is terrified of chemo.

04:17.833 --> 04:19.424
Well, they do much better

04:19.576 --> 04:22.344
managing side effects
these days.

04:23.079 --> 04:25.264
Surgery's not an option.

04:26.158 --> 04:27.841
There's only one hope left.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.327
Well, targeted therapy.

04:30.387 --> 04:34.681
It could buy my mother years
if she's a candidate.

04:35.501 --> 04:38.535
We're waiting
for the genetics now.

04:38.562 --> 04:41.613
Well, just, it's--
Keep me updated.

04:41.765 --> 04:43.740
Yeah.

04:46.603 --> 04:48.453
(door opens)

04:55.521 --> 04:56.444
Hi.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.779
Hey.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.023
I've got a birthday present
for you.

05:00.025 --> 05:02.450
Mm. My birthday isn't
until June.

05:02.544 --> 05:03.635
(Devon chuckles)

05:03.862 --> 05:05.804
Well, this is your new birthday.

05:06.031 --> 05:09.032
500 million
genetically modified cells

05:09.125 --> 05:10.717
ready to change your life

05:10.869 --> 05:14.387
by making healthy
red blood cells in your body.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.039
If we're lucky.

05:16.800 --> 05:21.061
I know it's experimental and
there are no guarantees, but...

05:21.213 --> 05:23.864
I can't believe
I have this chance.

05:24.733 --> 05:25.991
Is there anyone you want to call

05:26.142 --> 05:27.901
or FaceTime
for the big moment?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.645
Friends? Family?

05:30.664 --> 05:32.080
No.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.708
Dr. Cain?

05:35.652 --> 05:37.060
(scoffs)

05:37.153 --> 05:38.986
He, um...

05:39.006 --> 05:41.823
hasn't been by for a while.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.425
I'm sure he's busy.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.304
Well, this is a really big deal.

05:48.832 --> 05:51.424
You went through a lot
to get to this moment.

05:52.186 --> 05:55.395
I wouldn't be here without you.

05:57.583 --> 05:59.149
(chuckles softly)

06:01.920 --> 06:04.270
Rose...

06:04.423 --> 06:05.513
(beeps)

06:05.607 --> 06:08.408
...would you like
to do the honors?

06:10.037 --> 06:11.995

Please work.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.561

06:51.060 --> 06:52.652
We started her gene therapy
an hour ago.

06:52.804 --> 06:53.745
Now we wait.

06:53.897 --> 06:55.897
Is she strong? Is she ready?

06:55.991 --> 06:57.807
She's been through
a massive chemo blast

06:57.826 --> 06:59.066
that devastated her bone marrow.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.086
She's nauseous.
Her counts are dropping.

07:01.313 --> 07:03.571
Her mouth sores are so bad
she can barely swallow.

07:03.665 --> 07:05.740
So is she strong? No.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.834
But she is the bravest person
I've ever known,

07:07.928 --> 07:09.428
and she's ready.

07:10.656 --> 07:12.139

Bio South is running on fumes.

Uh, we need cash,

07:18.922 --> 07:20.939
if Rose has a bad outcome, so...

07:21.166 --> 07:22.774
Everything is riding on this.

07:22.926 --> 07:25.835
Look, if this works,
we stand to get FDA approval.

07:25.854 --> 07:27.353
And then sky's the limit.

07:27.506 --> 07:29.172
Thousands of other patients
with sickle cell disease

07:29.191 --> 07:31.341
would line up
for this treatment.

07:31.434 --> 07:34.177
And if it fails?

07:34.196 --> 07:37.438
(exhales)
The company will shutter.

07:37.532 --> 07:40.441
I will be bankrupt.

07:40.535 --> 07:41.943
(exhales)

07:42.854 --> 07:46.339
And Rose will have risked
her life for nothing.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.392
You recommended me to Dr. Wylie.

07:59.462 --> 08:02.814
Yeah, she was in the market
for a... promising resident.

08:03.041 --> 08:04.741
But you said
that I could work with you,

08:04.743 --> 08:06.543
that we were a pair,

08:06.561 --> 08:07.819
cut from the same cloth.

08:07.971 --> 08:09.488
You need more practice.

08:13.401 --> 08:15.218
And I'm focusing on my recovery.

08:15.237 --> 08:17.662
You're not gonna get your skills
back hiding in this office.

08:17.814 --> 08:18.980
I'm being cautious.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.665
The last time I was in the OR,

08:20.817 --> 08:22.501
you had to step in there
to save my ass.

08:22.728 --> 08:24.503
Can't ignore that.

08:24.730 --> 08:27.080
So you start with a softball,

08:27.174 --> 08:28.990
something simple you used to do
in your sleep.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.067
Can't afford another fumble.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.994
Kit's gonna send me packing.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.829
I have to know that,
when I come back,

08:34.848 --> 08:37.390
my work is gonna be perfect.

08:41.429 --> 08:43.930
Dr. Wylie is nowhere near
the surgeon you are.

08:44.082 --> 08:46.358
I want to learn from the best.

08:52.107 --> 08:55.242
Caution's not a good look
on you.

09:00.448 --> 09:01.781
(door opens)

09:01.950 --> 09:04.358
In case you don't remember,
Pete's not the easiest guy.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.786
Took the gold medal
in the curmudgeon Olympics.

09:06.880 --> 09:11.091
Well, if it doesn't take too
long, we can stay on schedule.

09:12.444 --> 09:13.534
(knocking)

09:13.554 --> 09:15.128
Hey, Pete! It's Nic

09:15.222 --> 09:17.222
from Chastain.
I'm here with Dr. Hawkins.

09:17.373 --> 09:18.464
Came to check on you.

09:18.708 --> 09:20.283
We're worried that you missed
your appointment.

09:20.302 --> 09:22.452
-(baseball bat drops)
-I'll survive.

09:23.455 --> 09:26.289
You know your cardiac medication
needs monitoring.

09:26.308 --> 09:27.715
Come on, Pete.
We'll do a quick check

09:27.734 --> 09:30.068
and then you won't have to go
to the hospital.

09:33.890 --> 09:35.991
Put those masks and gloves on.

09:38.728 --> 09:39.911
Okay.

09:40.138 --> 09:42.322
You know, if you'd get
the COVID-19 vaccine,

09:42.474 --> 09:44.732
you wouldn't have
to be so nervous about guests.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.567
I have no need.

09:46.661 --> 09:48.736
-I have no risk of exposure.
-(baseball bat drops)

09:48.830 --> 09:50.663
I see no one.

09:50.816 --> 09:52.482
It's Middle-earth.

09:52.500 --> 09:53.666
Needs a dragon.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.260
(exhales)

09:55.929 --> 09:57.429
You all right?

09:57.656 --> 09:58.988
Yeah.

09:59.007 --> 10:00.599
CONRAD: How long since
you've been out of your house?

10:00.750 --> 10:02.083
PETE:
Over a year.

10:02.144 --> 10:04.160
CONRAD:
How you feeling, Pete?

10:04.253 --> 10:08.348
(groans) I just woke up
from a nap, so a little groggy.

10:08.500 --> 10:12.760
The good news is I can take naps
whenever I damn well please.

10:13.521 --> 10:16.356
I see the judgment
in your faces. Proves my point.

10:16.450 --> 10:19.767
You've never known real freedom
till you lock your door.

10:19.861 --> 10:21.286
Look, no judgment.

10:21.437 --> 10:23.363
-CONRAD: We're
just worried about you.

10:23.515 --> 10:24.956

Why don't you let us
check you out,

nothing serious, okay?

10:30.830 --> 10:31.871
Okay.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.632
-All right.
-But first,

10:33.783 --> 10:35.191
let me get something to drink.

10:35.210 --> 10:36.376
-I'm thirsty. (groans)
-NIC: No, no, that's okay.

10:36.528 --> 10:38.452
I'll-I'll get you some water.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.430
(Pete panting)

10:42.701 --> 10:44.976
♪ ♪

10:53.895 --> 10:56.029
(sighs)

10:58.717 --> 10:59.974
Fridge is close to empty.

11:00.068 --> 11:01.642
CONRAD:
Pulse is irregular and rapid.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.611
Crackles at the bases.

11:03.722 --> 11:05.163
NIC:
Oh...

11:05.390 --> 11:07.073
Hey.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.334
CONRAD:
You having trouble
wearing shoes?

11:09.561 --> 11:12.003
When you don't go anywhere,
you don't need shoes.

11:12.230 --> 11:13.913
Distended neck veins.

11:14.065 --> 11:15.173
CONRAD:
Sorry, Pete, but we're gonna

11:15.324 --> 11:17.491
have to get you
to Chastain after all.

11:17.585 --> 11:19.068
No.

11:19.162 --> 11:21.495
-You can't make me go.
-NIC: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:21.589 --> 11:23.431
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.101
CONRAD:
Pete?

11:27.078 --> 11:29.336
-NIC: Calling 911.
-Pete?

11:29.431 --> 11:30.438
(line ringing)

11:35.195 --> 11:38.254
AUSTIN: You'd work much quicker
if you had gloves that fit.

11:38.347 --> 11:40.423
What is this,
the JNCO jeans of surgical wear?

11:40.442 --> 11:44.093
JESSICA:
Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. Devi, did we
get you the wrong size gloves?

11:44.112 --> 11:45.704
LEELA:
It's totally okay.

11:45.855 --> 11:46.854
AUSTIN:
It is not totally okay.

11:46.948 --> 11:49.082
Speak up for yourself.

11:50.285 --> 11:51.859
A six and a half
would be great next time.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.787
You got it. I think we're just
so used to prepping the OR

11:54.940 --> 11:56.622
for Dr. Austin and Dr. Okafor...

11:56.775 --> 11:59.884
AUSTIN:
And how would you think that she
could even fit in Mina's gloves?

12:00.036 --> 12:02.445
Look at this one-handed tie.

12:02.464 --> 12:04.614
Sloppy at best.

12:04.632 --> 12:06.307
Criminal at worst.

12:07.786 --> 12:09.302
And whenever we would do
a bypass,

12:09.454 --> 12:12.622
Dr. Okafor and I chose
the pedicled approach.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.624
That means there is a bit
to clean up,

12:14.642 --> 12:19.145
so I would throw a stitch
and Mina would cut my suture.

12:19.297 --> 12:20.980
Not there. Higher.

12:21.132 --> 12:23.649
No, that's too high. Lower.

12:23.802 --> 12:25.893
LEELA:
Like this?

12:25.987 --> 12:27.320
Would you steady
your hands, Devi?

12:27.414 --> 12:30.165
This is not a cadaver.
It's a father of three.

12:32.994 --> 12:35.069
Damn it!
You cut the vessel I needed.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.237
LEELA:
I'm sorry, Dr. Austin.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.647
AUSTIN:
Is an apology gonna console

12:37.740 --> 12:38.831
his children?

12:38.984 --> 12:39.907
Small vascular clamp
and 8.0 Prolene.

12:40.001 --> 12:42.719
Not to her. To me.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.080
I have to learn.

12:46.099 --> 12:49.675
You stay, you watch...
or you leave.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.269
It's your call.

13:02.507 --> 13:04.365
(panting)

13:06.119 --> 13:08.328
(muffled scream)

13:14.536 --> 13:16.536
Like this.

13:16.630 --> 13:20.006
(screaming gibberish)

13:22.193 --> 13:24.877
Nothing more satisfying than
teaching the important stuff

13:25.030 --> 13:27.263
to young residents.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.727
The day isn't going great.

13:33.872 --> 13:35.796
I messed up in the OR
with Raptor,

13:35.816 --> 13:38.632
and he yelled at me, again.

13:38.726 --> 13:39.967
Did you kill someone?

13:40.028 --> 13:43.238
-No.
-Then don't worry about it.

13:44.899 --> 13:46.640
I don't like to be humiliated.

13:46.734 --> 13:48.384
It wasn't about you, I promise.

13:48.403 --> 13:51.329
He's under a lot of pressure
right now, a family thing.

13:51.556 --> 13:55.124
Believe me, he's on a razor's
edge for a good reason.

13:55.894 --> 13:57.210
I'm sorry.

13:58.580 --> 14:02.048
So what's the hospital's CEO
doing in here, anyway?

14:03.251 --> 14:05.844
Bit of a challenging day
on my end, as well.

14:05.995 --> 14:07.920
The supply room
is a known resource

14:08.073 --> 14:09.180
when you're at your wit's end.

14:09.407 --> 14:11.516
It's quiet, private,
lots of pillows.

14:11.667 --> 14:13.409
(both chuckle)

14:13.428 --> 14:16.079
Come on, come with me.
I'll get you into another OR.

14:16.097 --> 14:19.298
Dr. Austin isn't the only
fine surgeon at Chastain.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.150
Dr. Voss?

14:22.921 --> 14:24.362
I would love to work
with you sometime.

14:24.589 --> 14:28.424
Well, if my ass isn't fired
shortly, we'll arrange it.

14:28.443 --> 14:29.742
Come on.

14:31.854 --> 14:34.614
Hey, Cindy. What happened?
You paged?

14:34.766 --> 14:36.799
She has an elevated temp. 100.1.

14:36.859 --> 14:38.543
(monitor beeping steadily)

14:38.694 --> 14:40.378
-And she's tachy.
-Yeah.

14:40.529 --> 14:41.604
Hey, Rose?

14:41.697 --> 14:42.955
Can you tell me
how you're feeling?

14:43.049 --> 14:44.957
Tired, a little hot.

14:45.110 --> 14:46.959
Let's give her a gram
of acetaminophen

14:47.053 --> 14:49.278
and bolus her a liter
of lactated ringers.

14:49.297 --> 14:50.388
Okay.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.892
It doesn't hurt anywhere.

14:54.043 --> 14:56.543
It's not like a pain
I've felt before.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.229
But I don't feel good.

14:59.641 --> 15:01.733
It couldn't be
the gene therapy, could it?

15:01.884 --> 15:03.643
I don't know yet.

15:03.795 --> 15:07.221
We'll give you some fluid and
order a set of blood cultures.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.725
I thought there was nothing left
that could scare me.

15:11.819 --> 15:14.746
Whatever happens,
we'll manage it.

15:14.897 --> 15:16.822
It's not that.

15:16.975 --> 15:18.824
I know what it is to be sick.

15:18.977 --> 15:21.477
(ragged exhale)

15:21.496 --> 15:23.296
But hope?

15:25.741 --> 15:28.818
When I pressed that button,

15:28.836 --> 15:31.412
it's what I felt.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.715
And I haven't felt that
in so long.

15:34.826 --> 15:37.268
I don't want to lose it.

15:44.110 --> 15:48.171
65-year-old male with syncope
and blunt abdominal trauma.

15:48.189 --> 15:50.006
IRVING: All right,
let's put him in Bay Two.

15:50.099 --> 15:53.100
BP 90/50,
heart rate 130 and irregular.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.328
02 sat 95%.

15:57.106 --> 15:59.474
PETE:
I fell on a chair. So what?

15:59.476 --> 16:02.276
I thought you two were spending
a day away from sick people.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.020
Well, best-laid plans...

16:04.038 --> 16:05.612
-One, two, three.
-Three.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.798
(Pete grumbles)

16:06.949 --> 16:09.859
Nothing good can come of this.

16:09.877 --> 16:12.211
-(monitor beeping rapidly)
-Told you.

16:12.363 --> 16:13.805
I'll order an EKG and labs.

16:13.956 --> 16:15.139
Crackles halfway up.

16:15.291 --> 16:17.141
-I need an X-ray stat.
-Yeah.

16:17.293 --> 16:19.936
-And I might have to intubate.
-Okay.

16:21.039 --> 16:22.538
-(Pete groans loudly)
-CONRAD: Pete,

16:22.557 --> 16:25.224
this isn't good,
and we have to fix it.

16:25.376 --> 16:29.529
Tenderness and guarding
in the right upper quadrant.

16:35.053 --> 16:37.078
(machine beeps)

16:38.481 --> 16:39.739
Damn it. Free fluid.

16:39.891 --> 16:44.168
He's on blood thinners
that weren't being monitored.

16:44.320 --> 16:47.964
And now he's bleeding
into his abdomen.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.470
(scrubbing hands)

17:02.914 --> 17:04.880
Dr. Wylie already has
three residents.

17:04.932 --> 17:09.027
BILLIE:
Yep. And I told you
I didn't want the gig.

17:11.531 --> 17:16.200
I need you and only you,
for a softball.

17:16.427 --> 17:20.329
Aneurysm clip, OR 7,
in 15 minutes.

17:29.865 --> 17:30.864
Dr. Wylie?

17:30.958 --> 17:32.291
I'm gonna have to pass.

17:32.443 --> 17:34.469
Dr. Cain has requested me.

17:49.143 --> 17:50.401
Hey. What's going on with Rose?

17:50.628 --> 17:51.477
Elevated temps.

17:51.629 --> 17:52.311
She's tachycardic.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.646
Her blood pressure is dropping.

17:53.798 --> 17:56.157
I called in her oncologist
to examine her.

17:59.228 --> 18:01.470
-How is she?
-Responding to fluids.

18:01.489 --> 18:02.638
Stable for now.

18:02.657 --> 18:05.157
If this is
a systemic inflammatory reaction

18:05.310 --> 18:07.827
from the cells,
we support her through it,

18:07.979 --> 18:09.545
and she should improve soon.

18:12.741 --> 18:14.834
Okay. I'll keep an eye on her.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.594
Okay, I have to see
another patient,

18:16.745 --> 18:19.413
but tell me if anything changes.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.474
Thank you.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.106
Yee, if you don't sit down...

18:28.257 --> 18:29.999
Your cancer is getting worse.

18:30.017 --> 18:33.352
When we know the next steps,
I'll sit.

18:33.504 --> 18:35.780
-So, until then...
-Your father has zero chill.

18:35.931 --> 18:37.340
-Tell me about it.
-And at the moment,

18:37.433 --> 18:39.842
-mine is in limited supply, too.
-(door opens)

18:39.861 --> 18:43.121
Hello, Carol. Yee.
Lovely to see you.

18:43.272 --> 18:45.514
Okay, Dr. Oliver, we can
dispense with the niceties.

18:45.533 --> 18:47.792
-We're dying here.
-Literally.

18:47.943 --> 18:49.702
-Carol.
-OLIVER: This will be short

18:49.796 --> 18:51.111
and very sweet.

18:51.205 --> 18:52.521
I am happy to say

18:52.582 --> 18:54.540
that Carol's cancer
has a mutation

18:54.634 --> 18:58.094
that qualifies her
for targeted therapy.

19:00.531 --> 19:01.547
Thank you.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.032
AUSTIN:
You hear that, Ma?

19:03.125 --> 19:04.308
This is incredible.

19:04.535 --> 19:07.294
Conventional chemo
is better than it used to be,

19:07.388 --> 19:08.629
but it's still a blunt tool.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.390
Targeted therapy
is exactly what the name says.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.043
It attacks only the changes
in the cancer cells

19:14.136 --> 19:17.822
that help it grow and spread
while sparing your normal cells.

19:17.973 --> 19:19.899
And what does this mean for me?

19:20.051 --> 19:23.068
I mean,
I know it's not a cure, but...

19:23.163 --> 19:25.738
OLIVER:
You still have stage IV cancer,

19:25.890 --> 19:27.239
but we are buying time.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.316
The cancer
will eventually come back,

19:29.335 --> 19:33.421
but by then, we could have new
and even better treatments.

19:34.565 --> 19:35.748
Mom.

19:35.900 --> 19:38.417
Mom, this is great news.

19:38.569 --> 19:40.511
(crying)

19:47.078 --> 19:49.670
So, the CT you ordered
showed a grade III liver lac.

19:50.598 --> 19:53.006
-What's
his most recent hemoglobin?
-NIC: 12.2.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.433
The second one
should be back any minute.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.194
Any guesses why he passed out
in the first place?

19:56.345 --> 19:59.255
-No idea. It was so abrupt.
-BELL: Doesn't make sense.

19:59.348 --> 20:01.090
So, what accounts
for the respiratory failure?

20:01.108 --> 20:01.866
It's all a mystery.

20:02.017 --> 20:03.850
His EKG and echo show evidence

20:03.870 --> 20:07.112
of severe pulmonary hypertension
with right-sided heart strain,

20:07.265 --> 20:08.764
and that's all new
from a year ago.

20:08.783 --> 20:09.949
We thought it could be a P.E.,

20:10.101 --> 20:11.709
but he's been
on his blood thinners,

20:11.936 --> 20:13.211
-so it's unlikely.
-BELL: Severe
pulmonary hypertension?

20:13.362 --> 20:15.771
So we don't want to put this guy
under anesthesia.

20:15.864 --> 20:17.215
Not if we can help it.

20:17.366 --> 20:19.608
Lab just called
with a critical value.

20:19.702 --> 20:21.368
Repeat hemoglobin 7.2.

20:21.462 --> 20:23.462
He's bleeding out.
We don't have a choice.

20:23.614 --> 20:25.223
Okay, yeah. Pack him up.
Get blood on hold.

20:25.450 --> 20:28.517
-Lots of blood.
And I'll meet him in the OR.
-On it.

20:30.921 --> 20:32.379
Randolph.

20:32.473 --> 20:34.214
-A favor?
-Yeah. Sure, but quickly.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.958
I have to prep a patient
for surgery.

20:35.977 --> 20:37.643
I have
a first-year surgical intern

20:37.795 --> 20:38.903
in need of a new mentor.

20:39.054 --> 20:40.554
He have a falling-out
with someone?

20:40.573 --> 20:41.906
She. Yes, and sort of.

20:42.057 --> 20:43.632
AJ let her have it in his OR.

20:43.651 --> 20:45.910
That's understandable.
AJ's under a lot of stress.

20:46.137 --> 20:48.320
He is, which is why
I would be eternally grateful

20:48.414 --> 20:49.914
if you could have her
in your surgeries today.

20:50.065 --> 20:51.156
Yeah. Is she any good?

20:51.309 --> 20:52.458
Judge for yourself.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.650
Solid technique. Fast.

21:01.744 --> 21:02.909
Clearly determined.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.837
She's whip-smart, too.

21:04.989 --> 21:07.306
Her name's Leela Devi.

21:10.085 --> 21:12.103
Dr. Devi? I'm Randolph Bell.

21:12.254 --> 21:14.730
How'd you like to throw
some of those in my OR?

21:15.850 --> 21:17.275
I would love to.

21:17.502 --> 21:19.277
Great. Let's go.

21:25.434 --> 21:27.009
-(monitor beeping rapidly)
-Rose, Rose,

21:27.028 --> 21:29.028
you've got to settle down.

21:29.122 --> 21:32.197
(gasping):
I don't... feel good.

21:32.366 --> 21:34.625
-Rose, steady.
-(breathing heavily)

21:34.777 --> 21:36.018
Deep breaths.

21:36.037 --> 21:38.945
-Deep breaths.
-(breathes deeply)

21:38.965 --> 21:41.448
-What happened?
-Well, she was holding her own,

21:41.467 --> 21:43.375
and then her blood pressure
plummeted to 70/40.

21:43.528 --> 21:45.528
Okay, give her another liter,
wide open.

21:45.621 --> 21:46.804
-Mm-hmm.
-And start her on norepi.

21:47.031 --> 21:48.288
(Rose gasps loudly)

21:48.382 --> 21:50.141
-I'm so hot!
-That's because
you have a fever.

21:50.292 --> 21:52.701
I have to examine you again,
okay?

21:52.720 --> 21:55.313
Ow! (groaning)

21:58.709 --> 22:00.559
-Fever.
-Mm-hmm.

22:00.711 --> 22:02.211
Hypotension, abdominal pain.

22:02.229 --> 22:03.804
I don't think
this is from the gene therapy.

22:03.823 --> 22:07.325
Rose, the chemo has suppressed
your immune system.

22:07.476 --> 22:10.569
I think you have a bad
infection, likely from your gut.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.330
So what... happens now?

22:12.481 --> 22:14.815
We're gonna get you
on the right antibiotics.

22:14.834 --> 22:18.577
All you have to do
is get some rest.

22:18.729 --> 22:20.338
You stay hopeful.

22:20.489 --> 22:22.131
Okay?

22:24.827 --> 22:27.136
AUSTIN:
Aneurysm clip.

22:30.091 --> 22:31.924
Proximal and distal clips
in place.

22:32.076 --> 22:34.143
Now I'll ligate the aneurysm.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.191
(sizzling)

22:43.938 --> 22:45.754
Oh, I trapped the aneurysm.

22:45.848 --> 22:47.514
I'm certain
I did that correctly.

22:47.533 --> 22:51.260
I don't... I don't understand
why this is happening.

22:51.278 --> 22:53.779
Find the feeder vessel...

22:53.931 --> 22:56.332
I don't need instruction
from a resident.

23:00.028 --> 23:02.463
(alarms sounding)

23:09.389 --> 23:11.872
Cerebral perfusion pressure
is falling.

23:11.891 --> 23:15.709
Get back in there, or this'll be
the last brain you ever touch.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.062
Suction.

23:19.214 --> 23:22.149
Need to see
what we're dealing with.

23:28.891 --> 23:30.991
There's the feeder. Clip?

23:38.643 --> 23:40.459
(beeps)

23:41.996 --> 23:43.754
Nice work, Dr. Cain.

23:43.906 --> 23:45.648
Yeah, please.

23:45.666 --> 23:48.317
I almost whiffed a softball.

23:48.335 --> 23:50.344
You close.
I'm finished here.

23:59.013 --> 24:01.588
Maybe he is finished.

24:01.682 --> 24:03.182
If so, no one will miss him.

24:03.334 --> 24:05.167
His hands are back.

24:05.260 --> 24:07.761
But surgeons thrive on hubris.

24:07.855 --> 24:11.198
The problem now is in his head.

24:17.606 --> 24:19.290
I got your page.

24:19.441 --> 24:21.292
Hey, it wasn't the gene therapy.

24:21.443 --> 24:23.519
Rose's blood cultures came back
positive. She's septic.

24:23.537 --> 24:26.112
-And how's she doing?
-We started her on the right

24:26.132 --> 24:28.114
antibiotics early.
She's stable now.

24:28.134 --> 24:30.025
But her kidneys took a hit.
Take a look.

24:30.044 --> 24:31.785
KIT:
Is she making urine?

24:31.804 --> 24:34.805
I have flooded her with fluids,
but no.

24:35.032 --> 24:37.123
Her potassium is climbing.

24:38.460 --> 24:43.296
Rose needs dialysis if she's
gonna make it past this crisis.

BELL:
Lap pad to me.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.834
Have you ever operated
on a liver lac?

25:03.944 --> 25:05.836
Never as first assist,
but I've read a lot about it.

25:06.063 --> 25:08.488
Okay, well, then tell me about
the blood supply of the liver.

25:08.582 --> 25:09.673
Another lap pad.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.066
Liver has dual blood supply--

25:11.159 --> 25:12.510
portal vein and the hepatic.

25:12.737 --> 25:15.237
-Mm-hmm.
-(monitor beeping)

25:15.256 --> 25:16.572
All right, Dr. Devi.

25:16.665 --> 25:19.058
Diffuse bleeding
from the liver. You're on.

25:21.428 --> 25:24.838
-What do you want to do?
-Manual compression.

25:24.932 --> 25:26.524
I take the liver in my hand,
and squeeze it.

25:26.675 --> 25:29.026
Okay, now do it.

25:31.197 --> 25:33.255
LEELA:
It's not working.
He's still bleeding.

25:33.274 --> 25:34.198
So what's your next move?

25:34.425 --> 25:36.057
I identify
and suture the bleeder?

25:36.110 --> 25:39.036
-(alarms sounding)
-Dr. Bell, our patient

25:39.187 --> 25:41.280
-isn't enjoying
this teaching moment.
-LEELA: I think

25:41.432 --> 25:42.948
-you should take over.
-BELL: No, there's no need

25:43.100 --> 25:44.691
to take over.
We're a team.

25:44.785 --> 25:47.127
3.0 Prolene to Dr. Devi.

25:51.125 --> 25:53.199
I saw you do this perfectly.

25:53.294 --> 25:55.535
It's muscle memory.
Just do it. Don't think.

25:55.629 --> 25:58.097
And if you have trouble,
I'm right here.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.151
Mm-hmm.

26:16.801 --> 26:19.034
Mm-hmm.

LEELA:

26:24.584 --> 26:26.959
(whirring)

26:30.331 --> 26:31.922
(beeps)

26:32.149 --> 26:35.092
Well done, Dr. Devi.

26:38.431 --> 26:39.988
Now, let's hope
Nic and Conrad can diagnose

26:40.007 --> 26:42.016
Pete's underlying problem.

26:50.276 --> 26:53.593
(sighs)
It was touch and go in surgery.

26:53.613 --> 26:55.520
He's on two pressors now.

26:55.673 --> 26:58.115
-Water.
-Oh, thank you.

26:59.619 --> 27:03.028
So, Bell fixed his liver lac,

27:03.180 --> 27:04.270
but that's still the least
of his problems.

27:04.365 --> 27:07.516
Did his rheumatological studies
come back?

27:07.609 --> 27:09.335
Yep. All normal.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.281
He'll need a right heart cath

27:15.376 --> 27:17.283
to measure
his pulmonary pressure.

27:17.378 --> 27:20.195
I'll check with Cardio
on that and schedule

27:20.288 --> 27:23.081
-a chest angio with CT.
-(sighs)

27:23.233 --> 27:24.716
If we can't figure out
the underlying cause

27:24.810 --> 27:26.034
of his pulmonary hypertension...

27:26.128 --> 27:27.794
There are treatment options,

27:27.888 --> 27:31.039
and we'll have to start looking
into them, but...

27:31.058 --> 27:33.317
he could die.

27:35.713 --> 27:37.321
Wait.

27:37.472 --> 27:39.973
When I went to get Pete water,

27:39.992 --> 27:43.177
all I saw in his kitchen
was rice and beans.

27:43.179 --> 27:45.570
<i> Only</i> rice and beans.

27:45.665 --> 27:47.331
No vegetables? No fruits?

27:47.482 --> 27:48.557
None.

27:48.650 --> 27:50.000
(laughs):
I mean, I know it seems crazy,

27:50.152 --> 27:52.077
a one-in-a-million case, but...

27:52.229 --> 27:54.505
Pete's suffering
from a vitamin deficiency.

27:54.732 --> 27:57.007
Think about it. He's been shut
in from COVID this whole time.

27:57.159 --> 27:59.084
That explains
the pulmonary hypertension.

27:59.236 --> 28:02.721
Nic, you may have just
saved his life.

28:04.332 --> 28:06.308
(sighs)

28:08.595 --> 28:10.688
Dialysis?

28:10.915 --> 28:13.582
My kidneys are failing?

28:13.600 --> 28:15.934
I've had family members
on dialysis,

28:16.086 --> 28:17.753
and they were miserable.

28:17.771 --> 28:20.013
It's devastating news, I know,

28:20.032 --> 28:22.491
but I think
it's gonna be temporary.

28:23.594 --> 28:24.943
Okay? I-I really...

28:25.095 --> 28:27.020
I really do, Rose.

28:27.114 --> 28:30.374
We have to give your kidneys
time to recover.

28:30.601 --> 28:32.358
And if they don't?

28:32.453 --> 28:33.877
Remember, Rose,

28:34.029 --> 28:37.005
we're focusing on hope.

28:38.533 --> 28:40.467
Look at me.

28:41.628 --> 28:44.279
I am about out of hope.

28:44.298 --> 28:46.448
I am out of everything.

28:47.134 --> 28:50.343
Just answer the question,
please.

28:51.138 --> 28:52.712
If your kidneys don't recover,

28:52.806 --> 28:56.442
you will be on dialysis
for the rest of your life.

28:59.980 --> 29:03.131
Is dying
from renal failure painful?

29:03.150 --> 29:05.467
-No, it is not,
but that's not where...
-Look,

29:05.486 --> 29:09.154
I appreciate everything
that you and Dr. Voss have done,

29:09.248 --> 29:13.083
but I am too tired
to go on any further.

29:13.753 --> 29:16.828
Rose, no.

29:16.922 --> 29:19.089
Rose, you're not gonna be alone.

29:19.316 --> 29:22.075
I'm going to be with you
the whole time.

29:22.094 --> 29:26.004
(crying):
I have nothing left.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.932
No dialysis, no anything.

29:29.084 --> 29:31.268
Rose, giving up
is not the answer.

29:31.419 --> 29:33.161
You have to fight,
you have to fight this

29:33.255 --> 29:34.772
and hold on to
what your life could be

29:34.999 --> 29:36.665
when this is behind you.

29:36.758 --> 29:40.694
I don't have any fight left.

29:41.888 --> 29:46.283
Call in hospice... please.

29:46.434 --> 29:48.844
I gave it my best shot.

29:48.862 --> 29:50.603
It's over.

29:50.697 --> 29:54.291
I can't do this anymore.

30:02.876 --> 30:04.968
(Rose sobs)

30:12.311 --> 30:14.219
I told you I didn't want
to come here. They filleted me

30:14.371 --> 30:15.979
like a dead fish,
and now I'm farting

30:16.206 --> 30:17.539
like a ten-year-old
Labrador retriever.

30:17.558 --> 30:18.982
Pete, if Dr. Bell hadn't
operated, you would have died.

30:19.134 --> 30:21.059
So the blame's on me?
I didn't eat right.

30:21.211 --> 30:23.136
Food as medicine.
What a crock.

30:23.230 --> 30:25.063
It's not a crock.
Not having

30:25.215 --> 30:27.991
enough vitamin C in your diet
can be life-threatening.

30:28.143 --> 30:30.068
It can increase the pressure
in the vessels

30:30.220 --> 30:32.162
leading from your heart
to your lungs,

30:32.389 --> 30:33.889
causing pulmonary hypertension.

30:33.982 --> 30:36.166
And that explains the strain
on your heart.

30:36.393 --> 30:39.077
Which caused shortness
of breath, the swelling.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.580
The lack of vitamin C
also explains the bruising.

30:41.732 --> 30:42.989
I get the gist.

30:43.008 --> 30:45.584
You want the big dose of,
uh, gratitude.

30:45.678 --> 30:47.235
Okay, here it goes.

30:47.254 --> 30:49.571
-Big thanks.
-(Conrad chuckles)

30:49.664 --> 30:52.908
-(Nic groans)
-Here's the bag, Nic.

30:53.001 --> 30:57.003
-Thank you.
-That's my vitamin C?

30:57.022 --> 30:58.338
What about
a nice chewable tablet?

30:58.432 --> 30:59.672
The kind I gave my kids?

30:59.766 --> 31:01.692
If we're right about this,
we should see a change

31:01.919 --> 31:03.009
in the numbers immediately.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.404
I'm not holding my breath.

31:06.757 --> 31:08.365
(Nic sighs heavily)

31:09.776 --> 31:10.942
So you have kids?

31:11.036 --> 31:12.870
One more disappointment.

31:13.021 --> 31:14.371
You're pregnant.
I have eyes.

31:14.598 --> 31:17.190
You think it's gonna be all,
uh, hugs and kisses

31:17.209 --> 31:19.042
and "I love you, Mommy,
with all my heart."

31:19.269 --> 31:21.937
News flash: they become
teenagers, and they turn on you.

31:22.030 --> 31:24.214
Then they spend the rest
of their lives griping

31:24.366 --> 31:28.552
about that one birthday party
that didn't meet expectations.

31:31.873 --> 31:34.224
You seeing what I'm seeing?

31:34.894 --> 31:36.876

31:36.896 --> 31:38.896

Pulmonary artery pressure

31:39.047 --> 31:40.564
is still higher
than we'd like to see,

31:40.791 --> 31:42.674
but it's coming down.

31:42.826 --> 31:45.493
Feeling better, Pete?

31:45.495 --> 31:47.963
Maybe. A little.

31:47.981 --> 31:50.390
Okay, great. We'll take that
as a rave review.

31:50.409 --> 31:53.226
Nic's on maternity leave. I'll
be back to check on you, though.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.654
Control that impulse
as much as possible.

31:55.806 --> 31:57.998
We'll see you later, Pete.

32:00.735 --> 32:02.661
Not the day we hoped for.

32:02.813 --> 32:05.422
Eh, but the kind we live for.

32:05.649 --> 32:07.740
Grumpy patient or not.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.668
Gratitude not required.

I'm glad I lived
to see this day.

32:29.097 --> 32:32.157
And we hope
there'll be many more, Mom.

Enough to find the next miracle.

Science wins.
