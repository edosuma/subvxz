00:22.423 --> 00:23.791
<i>Previously
on</i> Raising Kanan...

00:24.024 --> 00:26.293
All I want is for Kanan
to know I'm his father.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.729
Truth is, I don't even know
who Kanan daddy is.

00:28.763 --> 00:30.431
I don't remember shit
from that night.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.433
The kid--
he can't shoot for shit.

00:32.466 --> 00:33.501
That crazy-ass cop.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.369
I thought you said he
didn't remember my face, Mom.

00:35.403 --> 00:36.470
What is this?

00:36.504 --> 00:38.172
- I want you out.
- Where am I gonna go?

00:38.205 --> 00:39.540
I don't have any money.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.308
I don't know, and I don't care!

00:41.342 --> 00:42.710
What you think about hustling
in my mixtapes?

00:42.743 --> 00:45.246
Yo, you like music? You got
to check out his mixtape, man,

00:45.279 --> 00:47.715
Puerto Rican Famous--
he like the next LL, for real, right here.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.784
- What you boys selling?
- Mixtapes, man.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.285
All right, the both of you,
up against the wall.

00:51.318 --> 00:53.220
What the fuck are you doing?

00:53.254 --> 00:54.522
<i>The rats are too many.</i>

00:54.555 --> 00:56.290
Call an exterminator, Juliana.

00:56.323 --> 00:58.292
<i>You have
all this money sitting here.</i>

00:58.325 --> 00:59.560
Why don't you spend it?

00:59.593 --> 01:01.395
- You remember my mom at all?
- Of course.

01:01.429 --> 01:04.265
She lives in Harlem--
divorced twice, no kids.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.332
Yeah Zisa here--

01:05.332 --> 01:07.168
she's the cream
of the proverbial crop.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.737
- I propose a single deal.
-  Done.

01:09.770 --> 01:10.838
What the fuck?

01:11.071 --> 01:13.140
- I'm moving, Lou.
- You're leaving tomorrow?

01:13.174 --> 01:15.509
I got to look out for myself
because no one else is gonna do it.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.545
<i>I saw Raq today.
It scared me.</i>

01:17.578 --> 01:19.613
It scared me for all of us--
for me, you, and Jerome.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.749
Raq ain't gonna do nothing
to us, all right?

01:21.782 --> 01:24.618
- Why y'all want to mess with me?
- We know you a hell of an earner.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.620
We got to get the team
back together, man.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.222
I'm on the other shit, 'Nique.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.257
What, you on Raq's dick, nigga?

01:30.291 --> 01:33.093
But y'all giving 40 projects
to Unique's boy instead of me?

01:33.127 --> 01:35.463
I've been down with
y'all niggas since I was 14!

01:35.496 --> 01:36.530
We got you, Scrap.

01:36.564 --> 01:37.598
-  You got a snitch.
- Scrap?

01:37.631 --> 01:38.666
<i>He working with us.</i>

01:38.699 --> 01:40.234
Scrap could put us all away forever.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.435
Let's do this, then.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.337
Oh.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.638
- Nah.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.332
<i>Ha ha. That's right.</i>

03:21.268 --> 03:23.771
Don't listen to the lowlife!

03:27.808 --> 03:29.843
<i>Everyone a liar in the game...</i>

03:29.877 --> 03:32.313
Hey! Put it back.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.647
<i>...from
the crackhead telling you</i>

03:33.681 --> 03:35.382
<i>he'll get you next time
when he coppin'</i>

03:35.416 --> 03:37.818
<i>to the corner boy bullshittin'
about how clean his dope is</i>

03:37.851 --> 03:40.421
<i>to the cop
who's skimmin' off his bust.</i>

03:40.454 --> 03:41.889
<i>Everyone's full of shit.</i>

03:44.925 --> 03:46.560
Eighty-nine cents.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.596
<i>The truth
is like that fucking J Train.</i>

03:48.629 --> 03:52.433
<i>Shit might be slow,
might be late,</i>

03:52.466 --> 03:54.501
<i>might even skip a few stops
along the way...</i>

03:58.439 --> 04:00.474
<i>...but the truth's comin'...</i>

04:00.507 --> 04:02.977
<i>so pay
your fuckin' fare, nigga.</i>

04:13.020 --> 04:15.656
<i>Yo, how you livin', B?</i>

04:19.493 --> 04:21.528
My mother ain't here, man.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.998
I know. I saw her leave.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.769
I just wanted to spit at you
right quick.

04:28.802 --> 04:29.770
Get in.

05:04.538 --> 05:07.341
What your mom's
told you about me?

05:07.374 --> 05:10.544
Like I told you before,
we don't really talk about you.

05:18.052 --> 05:21.522
What I'm about to tell you...

05:21.555 --> 05:24.825
is gonna be the craziest shit
you ever heard...

05:24.858 --> 05:26.927
but the realest shit
I'ma ever say.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.811
I'm your father, Kanan.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.851
Shit crazy, right?

05:50.884 --> 05:53.420
It made me laugh, too.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.722
Your whole life,
you've been thinking

05:54.755 --> 05:56.757
Def Con your daddy,
but he ain't.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.626
I am.

06:01.595 --> 06:02.930
Everything that happened
with your mother,

06:02.963 --> 06:03.997
that's for another day,

06:04.031 --> 06:06.500
but I only found out
recently myself.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.102
Had I known before
when you was younger, you know,

06:08.135 --> 06:10.404
I-I'd like to say

06:10.437 --> 06:12.406
I would've been there for you
and all of that, but...

06:12.439 --> 06:15.109
...who knows?

06:15.142 --> 06:17.511
The truth is, all this time,

06:17.544 --> 06:20.614
I ain't been giving a fuck
about nobody but me.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.018
I know this is a lot
to take in.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.955
I don't expect you
to say nothing now, but...

06:29.923 --> 06:32.126
...I want to be
in your life, Kanan.

06:33.727 --> 06:37.664
Whatever that means,
whatever that looks like...

06:37.698 --> 06:39.466
that's what I want.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.771
I'm supposed to go meet up
with my friends,

06:43.804 --> 06:46.540
and I'm, uh, already
running late, so...

06:46.573 --> 06:48.876
No doubt.
Go link with your peoples.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.477
I'll be around.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.617
Yo, your mom's gonna say
I'm crazy.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.118
I'm not.

07:18.505 --> 07:21.508
<i>Whoever said
New Jersey America's armpit</i>

07:21.542 --> 07:23.977
is talkin' mad shit
about armpits.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.780
Feel just like home to me.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.849
Worrell's cousin live out here.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.185
Told him that the crew
that was running these blocks

07:31.218 --> 07:33.987
just got rolled up by the feds.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.590
Ain't been stepped in yet.

07:36.623 --> 07:37.991
And there's a whole
lot of demand,

07:38.025 --> 07:39.226
and we about to be
the new supply.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.595
Worrell callin' shots now?

07:41.628 --> 07:42.830
I'm callin' shots.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.531
Worrell, he just looking out,

07:44.565 --> 07:45.933
which is what
you supposed to do.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.902
We already up in Baisley's
and the Forties.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.637
We really need to fuck
with Jersey right now?

07:50.671 --> 07:53.507
We tryin' to grow,
Marvin, build.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.875
And New York
is already spoken for.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.611
The real opportunities
are outside the city.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.514
You makin' big decisions quick.

08:00.547 --> 08:02.249
Maybe we need to take a minute.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.752
My decisions are keeping
you paid and off of Rikers.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.021
I'm just saying...

08:08.055 --> 08:09.723
we don't know
the players in Jersey.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.859
But we know the game.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.660
Spot gonna be yours, Damon.

08:13.694 --> 08:14.962
Yeah, you gonna be
in charge out here.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.730
Now, spread around some cash,
get y'all crewed up,

08:16.763 --> 08:18.832
and then you gonna be up
and running.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.834
But for now, we gonna bust out
some work to you

08:20.868 --> 08:22.069
from my lab on the Southside.

08:22.102 --> 08:25.539
Y'all already know
I'm down for whatever--bet.

08:25.572 --> 08:27.608
We franchisin', fellas.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.770
Yo, that's my niece
right there.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.306
What I tell you?
Fucking told you, right?

10:06.340 --> 10:08.709
Right there,
that's my niece, man.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.677
You know, I-I helped to produce
the music and all that,

10:10.711 --> 10:14.982
but the vocals and the lyrics,
I mean, that's all her.

10:15.015 --> 10:18.352
I mean, God damn,
I felt all that.

10:18.385 --> 10:21.688
For real.
Your words was hittin'.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.857
Your vocals are strong as hell.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.794
But the look, uh...

10:29.162 --> 10:30.897
You supposed to look
like a bitch that niggas

10:30.931 --> 10:32.032
want to fuck with.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.201
Is you buggin', nigga?

10:34.234 --> 10:38.205
When I close my eyes,
it's like I'm loving you.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.706
I open my eyes, and I'm like,

10:39.740 --> 10:41.742
"Who is this girl looking like
she in New Edition?"

10:41.775 --> 10:43.143
Who the fuck is you talkin' to?

10:43.176 --> 10:45.178
<i>That is my niece, nigga.
Watch your fucking mouth.</i>

10:45.212 --> 10:47.814
How you look is just
as important as how you sound.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.751
Nigga, don't tell me Zisa bein'
a dime and all sexy and shit

10:50.784 --> 10:52.686
wasn't the reason you wanted
to sign her in the first place.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.087
Shit matters.

10:54.121 --> 10:57.057
Juke ain't Zisa,
and Zisa ain't Juke.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.362
Hey, Juke, um...

11:04.698 --> 11:06.833
Crown ain't all the way wrong.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.735
You beautiful.

11:08.769 --> 11:11.338
You got to tap
into that beauty, right?

11:11.371 --> 11:14.141
And put it out there
so everybody else can see it.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.811
This is who I am, Uncle Lou.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.413
This is me.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.915
What you see, that's who I am.

11:21.948 --> 11:23.417
That's what I'm saying.

11:23.450 --> 11:26.253
- You, you beautiful.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.321
I'm telling you that we should
share that with the world.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.756
That's all.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.225
Uh-huh, okay, so what
y'all are telling me is

11:32.259 --> 11:34.127
y'all want me walking around
looking like a hoochie?

11:34.161 --> 11:35.896
- Pretty much.
- Fuck out of here with--

11:35.929 --> 11:37.097
It's not about you
being no hoochie.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.432
Right.

11:38.465 --> 11:39.866
<i>All I'm saying
is I want you to maximize</i>

11:39.900 --> 11:42.102
what you already have,
that's all.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.942
It ain't--that wasn't--

11:50.944 --> 11:52.446
I'll get at you later.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.981
Juke, Juke, you know
that's not what I meant.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.450
That's--I-I--
It came out wrong.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.752
Y-you're beautiful
is what I'm--

11:58.785 --> 12:00.287
- I'm just sayin' you--

12:04.224 --> 12:07.060
She's a kid.
You watch how you talk to her.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.261
Don't matter how old she is.

12:08.295 --> 12:12.165
She want it,
she got to know what it takes.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.400
And so do you.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.802
You know about a lot of shit,
don't you, Crown?

12:15.836 --> 12:17.871
I think I know enough, nigga.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.107
Like where my girl
can find a job in Cali, right?

12:20.140 --> 12:23.376
Jessica asked me, so I was
just lookin' out for her,

12:23.410 --> 12:26.079
like I would do for you
or anybody.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.482
Don't be hatin' on a nigga
'cause he a little generous.

12:28.515 --> 12:31.151
Now, why would I hate
on you for being generous

12:31.184 --> 12:34.054
when you give me so many
other reasons to hate on you?

12:34.087 --> 12:36.156
I'm not angry.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.125
I just...

12:38.158 --> 12:40.127
<i>feel dead,</i>

12:40.160 --> 12:44.498
<i>like I can't feel anything
or care about anything.</i>

12:44.531 --> 12:46.299
<i>Could it be
that the medication you're on</i>

12:46.333 --> 12:48.268
<i>is not only
suppressing your anger</i>

12:48.301 --> 12:50.904
<i>but also dulling
your other feelings?</i>

12:50.937 --> 12:52.072
<i>It may be that your doctor</i>

12:52.105 --> 12:55.108
<i>just needs to adjust
your medication.</i>

12:55.142 --> 12:57.544
<i>What about you, Marvin? Hmm?</i>

12:57.777 --> 13:00.447
You have anything you want
to share with the group today?

13:02.048 --> 13:03.550
I'm good.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.019
I tell you
whether you're good or not.

13:06.052 --> 13:09.523
And then I tell the judge.
That's how this works.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.028
Fine, whatever.

13:15.061 --> 13:17.364
Um...

13:17.397 --> 13:20.867
say some--say somebody
talkin' shit to me,

13:20.901 --> 13:23.537
up in my face,
stank-ass breath on me.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.406
My reaction is to put
a foot up they ass.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.175
That's what I do.
That's what I've always done.

13:28.208 --> 13:31.878
I won't lie. Shit works for me.
Makes my teeth white.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.014
That's called open aggression.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.183
Me or the nigga talking shit?

13:36.216 --> 13:37.317
You.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.952
Eh.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.288
Then that's me, then--
open and aggressive.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.592
When you feel unregulated
like that,

13:45.825 --> 13:48.995
one of the techniques
that we talk about

13:49.029 --> 13:53.033
to regain control of yourself
and the situation

13:53.066 --> 13:54.534
is breathing.

13:54.568 --> 13:59.506
Remember, everybody, breathe,
get regulated,

13:59.539 --> 14:04.044
and then calmly, quietly,
and peacefully

14:04.077 --> 14:07.314
<i>address this individual</i>

14:07.347 --> 14:10.150
and de-escalate the situation.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.320
Breathe with me,
everyone, okay?

14:19.125 --> 14:21.895
Breath in.

14:21.928 --> 14:24.397
Let it all go.

14:27.934 --> 14:30.370
<i>- Inhale.</i>

14:30.403 --> 14:32.606
<i>Let it all go.</i>

14:39.112 --> 14:40.647
You late, nigga.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.382
My mother had me doing
some cleaning and shit

14:42.415 --> 14:43.383
around the crib.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.484
I'm here now, so what's up?

14:44.517 --> 14:47.487
Raq must be all fucked up
about Scrap.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.889
And why would she be
all fucked up about Scrap?

14:51.658 --> 14:54.461
'Cause Scrap dead, man.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.296
Cops found him in
some broke-down building

14:56.329 --> 14:57.931
up on Rockaway Boulevard.

14:57.964 --> 15:00.133
He killed hisself.
I thought you knew all this.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.469
Get the fuck out of here, man.
What are you talkin' about?

15:02.502 --> 15:03.903
Scrap wouldn't do
no shit like that.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.472
That's not even possible.

15:05.505 --> 15:09.209
I saw his whole family
roll up to his mother house, K.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.111
Scrappy gone.

15:14.147 --> 15:17.684
Maybe losing a eye really did
get to this nigga, you know?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.253
Thought he liked
that shit, man.

15:20.287 --> 15:23.957
Said it kept niggas shook.
It--it had 'em scared.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.959
Look, I already went up
in this spot.

15:25.992 --> 15:27.260
It's wack as hell.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.095
Fucking toilet in the kitchen,

15:29.129 --> 15:31.498
but it ain't no real kitchen anyway.

15:31.531 --> 15:32.932
Don't even matter

15:32.966 --> 15:35.435
'cause it's still a spot
I can't fucking afford.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.240
Scrappy can get caught up
behind them dice games

15:40.273 --> 15:42.275
and cards and shit.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.443
But that nigga
made more in a day

15:43.476 --> 15:45.378
than motherfuckers make
in a whole year.

15:45.412 --> 15:48.281
Now, how my mom put
the word out to my whole fam

15:48.315 --> 15:49.949
not to help me
with nothing neither?

15:49.983 --> 15:52.018
Look, I can't sleep
at the Y again, K.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.654
Some old drunk motherfucker
tried to slide in my bed.

15:56.990 --> 16:00.060
Yo, look, I'm not tryin' to be,
like, insensitive or nothin',

16:00.093 --> 16:03.029
but can we focus on a nigga
that's still breathing

16:03.063 --> 16:06.232
and alive
and don't got a place to stay?

16:09.269 --> 16:11.371
I'm gonna go grab the rest
of your tapes.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.472
Come on, man.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.074
Even I know my tapes
ain't selling.

16:14.107 --> 16:17.744
That's exactly why we gonna
sell 'em different this time.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.446
I don't even know
what that means,

16:19.479 --> 16:21.314
but fuck it, I'm down.

16:21.348 --> 16:24.217
How in the fuck my mother
ain't tell me about Scrap?

16:25.452 --> 16:27.220
<i>I don't know.</i>

17:09.162 --> 17:11.231
Juliana, it's Raq.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.532
Where you at?

17:12.565 --> 17:15.068
<i>And why the store closed up?</i>

17:15.101 --> 17:16.636
Hit me.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.534
Juliana? You here?

17:59.112 --> 18:00.346
Juliana.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.624
No.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.227
Hell, no.

18:30.743 --> 18:31.811
Fuck!

18:50.430 --> 18:52.465
- I'm workin', Raq.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.177
Excellent work, everyone.

19:04.210 --> 19:06.646
Thank you so much.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.449
Thank you so much for your
share today--beautiful.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.687
Marvin.

19:14.721 --> 19:18.358
I'm gonna keep pressing you,
and I'm not gonna stop.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.793
And now you know
I'm--I'm what you call, um,

19:20.827 --> 19:23.730
open and attractive.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.365
Openly aggressive.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.766
Right, right.

19:26.799 --> 19:31.471
So, um, I guess we'll see how--
you know, how it go.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.207
You press on an openly
aggressive motherfucker

19:34.240 --> 19:36.209
like me.

19:36.242 --> 19:40.213
- Work?

19:40.246 --> 19:42.215
Ah, family.

19:42.248 --> 19:43.416
I mean, same shit, though.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.518
Work, family,
ain't no difference.

19:45.552 --> 19:49.255
Right, well, remember
your breathing, Marvin.

19:50.456 --> 19:53.293
You know I got you, Miss Renée.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.768
This ain't just
your world, little nigga.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.436
Watch where the fuck you going.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.405
Hey, hey, hey, hold that shit,
hold that shit!

20:06.439 --> 20:07.907
Put your hand in the door,
motherfucker!

20:07.941 --> 20:09.576
-  My bad, man!
- Ah.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.911
Punk-ass bitch.

20:11.945 --> 20:14.714
Elevator finally working.
I still can't fuck with it.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.482
<i>That wasn't no jumbo, man.</i>

20:16.516 --> 20:19.319
<i>That shit was straight dust.
Didn't even feel it.</i>

20:19.352 --> 20:21.254
Yo, you done?

20:21.287 --> 20:22.655
Keep it movin'.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.257
<i>Man, fuck y'all.</i>

20:24.290 --> 20:25.558
'Nique knew what a jumbo was,

20:25.592 --> 20:27.660
and it wasn't it
this pieced-up bullshit!

20:31.831 --> 20:33.433
Raq kid.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.779
Juliana!

20:46.813 --> 20:48.581
It's Raq.

21:45.938 --> 21:48.808
- What's up, man?
- What up?

21:48.841 --> 21:50.443
Yo, where Marvin at?

21:50.476 --> 21:53.513
- He at his angry-nigga class.
- Which only makes him angrier.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.982
- Yeah, I forgot about that.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.603
Damn, if she ain't here,
I'll catch y'all later.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.674
If you do see Marvin,

22:21.708 --> 22:23.810
let him know
I came looking for Raq.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.882
Door's open.
Move out the fucking way.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.490
Boss is here.

22:40.526 --> 22:41.761
- Get out.

22:50.103 --> 22:52.805
I done paged your brother
three times, and still nothing.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.674
Lou fucking around
behind them ones and twos.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.410
All our shit is gone, Marvin.

22:57.443 --> 22:59.045
Juliana gone with it.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.513
And whoever did it
took the security tapes,

23:00.546 --> 23:01.748
so there ain't shit
for us to see.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.683
Mami done taxed us.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.918
Bitch took all our money

23:05.952 --> 23:07.920
and bounce back home
to El Colombo

23:07.954 --> 23:09.589
or wherever the fuck she from.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.057
Nah, she know we in business
with her cousin.

23:11.090 --> 23:13.159
Robbin' from us
is like robbin' from Joaquin.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.562
Yo, we got
that big re-up in two days

23:16.596 --> 23:19.098
for Baisley, Forties,
and Jersey.

23:19.132 --> 23:21.033
If we ain't got the money
to cover it,

23:21.067 --> 23:23.736
shit gonna get stupid.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.171
Maybe we should let
Joaquin know about it now.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.672
No.

23:26.706 --> 23:29.475
Juliana fucked us, Joaquin,
he probably know already.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.177
<i>And if he don't know,
the last thing we want to do</i>

23:31.410 --> 23:34.747
is tell him that his cousin got
grabbed up along with our loot.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.449
And it ain't even about that.

23:36.482 --> 23:37.784
If it was just about the money,

23:37.817 --> 23:39.986
they wouldn't have grabbed up
Juliana, but they did.

23:42.455 --> 23:44.524
Whoever did this shit...

23:44.557 --> 23:45.858
they want us to come
looking for 'em.

23:45.892 --> 23:47.827
Nah, ain't nobody wild enough
to fuck with us like this

23:47.860 --> 23:50.129
just to have us come look
for 'em.

23:52.165 --> 23:53.199
Nah, I know just the wild nigga

23:53.432 --> 23:56.002
who would do some shit
like this.

23:56.035 --> 23:58.037
So do you.

23:58.070 --> 24:01.174
Yo, how the fuck
we just throwing my shits away?

24:01.207 --> 24:02.708
I thought the point
was to sell them

24:02.742 --> 24:04.143
and hustle up this rent money.

24:04.177 --> 24:05.645
Didn't we try that before, nigga?

24:05.678 --> 24:07.480
Remember? Didn't work.

24:07.513 --> 24:11.017
So we gonna flip it this time,
and your ass is gonna get paid.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.721
My shits was live, man.

24:15.755 --> 24:18.191
I don't give a fuck
what nobody say.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.899
Your mother
would've never let us drink

24:26.933 --> 24:28.134
out of anything but glasses.

24:28.167 --> 24:30.169
Yeah, just screaming
down at us right now,

24:30.203 --> 24:34.073
"Use the tumblers.
Use the tumblers."

24:34.106 --> 24:37.176
- Miss you, Eleanor.
- Love you, Mom.

24:42.215 --> 24:45.184
I heard your partner got
out of the hospital.

24:45.218 --> 24:47.053
But he still can't remember
a fucking thing

24:47.086 --> 24:48.688
about what happened to him.

24:48.721 --> 24:52.959
Yeah, that's what he's saying.
But who knows?

24:52.992 --> 24:55.728
I'm not following you, Shannon.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.865
Howard...

24:58.898 --> 25:00.967
he keeps a hell of a lot
of stuff to himself,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.202
and there's been some moments
where I wonder

25:03.236 --> 25:06.172
if he's holding shit back
from me about what happened.

25:06.205 --> 25:09.709
You don't ever wonder
about your partner

25:09.742 --> 25:12.578
<i>and he don't ever
wonder about you.</i>

25:12.612 --> 25:16.616
Your lives depend
on the trust you two share.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.017
That's how it works.

25:18.050 --> 25:21.087
<i>That's how it's always worked.</i>

25:22.922 --> 25:24.290
Yes, sir.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.563
Come get that Famous shit,

25:30.596 --> 25:34.700
go-straight-to-your-head shit,
get that hot, hot, hot shit.

25:37.603 --> 25:39.272
Looks like sales
are pickin' up.

25:39.305 --> 25:40.806
What can I say, man?

25:40.840 --> 25:42.942
Fame is spittin' that realness.
Word gettin' out.

25:42.975 --> 25:45.311
"Fame is spittin'
that realness."

25:52.618 --> 25:54.687
Let me get Famous. Two times.

25:59.158 --> 26:03.930
<i>Get that Hollywood.
It feel so good.</i>

26:20.880 --> 26:23.115
Now, that's a hit.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.017
It's good.
I mean, the shit is catchy.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.885
It--it might even
be some kind of hit,

26:59.919 --> 27:02.688
but not for this girl,
not for this kind of talent.

27:02.722 --> 27:05.825
No, Zisa needs
something bigger,

27:05.858 --> 27:07.693
somethin'
with some feeling to it.

27:07.727 --> 27:09.362
This girl is not just a singer.

27:09.395 --> 27:13.265
- She is a virtuoso, an artiste.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.167
- I like the song.

27:15.201 --> 27:17.937
- I think it's cool.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.306
Do you not get my pages,
or you just ignore them?

27:20.339 --> 27:23.843
Fairest creatures,
we desire increase.

27:23.876 --> 27:27.313
That thereby beauty's rose
shall never die.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.682
That's Shakespeare's
first sonnet.

27:29.715 --> 27:32.118
Cartier Fareed.

27:33.386 --> 27:34.754
I know who you are.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.424
Raquel Thomas, Lou's sister,

27:38.657 --> 27:40.159
who's about to put
a foot in his ass.

27:40.192 --> 27:42.695
Well, you are nothing short
of a revelation,

27:42.728 --> 27:44.797
Raquel Thomas.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.199
We need to talk, now.

27:47.233 --> 27:49.802
Well, I'm hoping this
is just a short prologue

27:49.835 --> 27:51.437
to a far longer story for us.

27:56.409 --> 27:58.210
Look, my bad.
I'm doing shit right now.

27:58.244 --> 27:59.845
Nah, Lou, don't, not now.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.914
I don't want to hear
your usual bullshit.

28:01.947 --> 28:05.418
All of that shit in there
is bought and paid for by me.

28:05.451 --> 28:07.153
<i>So you--you cashin'
the checks I write,</i>

28:07.186 --> 28:08.421
<i>but you not takin' my calls?</i>

28:08.454 --> 28:10.823
You a nosy little motherfucker,
huh, Macho Man?

28:11.857 --> 28:13.025
We been hit, Lou.

28:13.059 --> 28:14.427
All our shit got grabbed up
at the bodega,

28:14.460 --> 28:16.028
and we can't find Juliana.

28:16.062 --> 28:18.097
And this is about to be the
biggest re-up we've ever had.

28:18.130 --> 28:20.066
And all our work for Baisley,
Forties, and Jersey,

28:20.099 --> 28:21.367
and we ain't got
the money to cover it.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.803
Joaquin will front that shit
on consignment.

28:23.836 --> 28:25.771
We done showed and proved
for that nigga, right?

28:25.805 --> 28:28.040
You really think that he gonna
front us with his cousin gone?

28:28.074 --> 28:29.408
Hell, no.

28:29.442 --> 28:31.310
And even if he did, the last
place we'd ever want to be

28:31.343 --> 28:33.079
is owin' money
to them Colombians.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.780
I ain't goin' out like that.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.983
Nah, this Unique.

28:38.017 --> 28:40.252
This is what this nigga do.

28:40.286 --> 28:42.721
When he wants my attention,
he fucks with my world.

28:42.755 --> 28:44.490
Yo, 'Nique would have to be
crazy out his fucking mind

28:44.723 --> 28:46.125
to fuck with the stash--
come on.

28:46.158 --> 28:47.927
Look, I'm goin'
to talk to Worrell.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.329
I need you to get on the block
and see what they sayin'.

28:50.362 --> 28:53.099
- All right.
- It's time to work, Lou.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.133
Real work.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.835
I'm on it.

29:01.373 --> 29:04.143
Yo, your customers
are pissing in the stairwell

29:04.176 --> 29:05.744
and smoking up in the elevator.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.446
Not that there's never any room
for me in that shit anyway

29:07.480 --> 29:09.014
with all your people
going in and out.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.082
I'll look into it.

29:10.116 --> 29:11.250
You don't need to look into it.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.919
I just told you
what the fuck it is.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.287
Yo, step off or roll off

29:15.321 --> 29:16.856
or whatever the fuck
it is you do, nigga,

29:16.889 --> 29:18.491
'cause you mad close
on me right now.

29:18.524 --> 29:20.793
Fuck you.

29:20.826 --> 29:22.428
Look, everybody getting
a little something-something

29:22.461 --> 29:24.964
for their patience
and accommodations.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.899
You took our money,
you know our deal.

29:26.932 --> 29:28.334
Your money ain't nearly enough
to cover me

29:28.367 --> 29:30.803
waitin' on the elevator
for 45 minutes every day

29:30.836 --> 29:32.805
'cause that motherfucker always
too crowded.

29:32.838 --> 29:34.874
All right?

29:34.907 --> 29:36.976
Yo, I'm gonna say it again.

29:37.009 --> 29:38.511
You need to back the fuck up.

29:38.544 --> 29:40.346
You serious?

29:40.379 --> 29:41.981
You think I'm scared
of you, nigga?

29:42.014 --> 29:43.215
I got shot seven times,

29:43.249 --> 29:45.985
and I'm still puttin' fools
on they back.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.486
Be the next nigga.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.495
I hear you.

29:56.529 --> 29:59.899
I hear you and understand.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.801
I'm sorry
for your troubles, brother.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.803
- I'll deal with it.

30:04.837 --> 30:06.338
Yeah, you will.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.374
Yo, everybody
get the fuck off the elevator.

30:08.407 --> 30:10.376
My man here got places to be.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.311
Let's go. Come on.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.184
I got you.

30:18.217 --> 30:20.486
Demo, nigga. Better recognize.

30:31.263 --> 30:33.032
Huh.

30:36.869 --> 30:39.872
Openly and aggressive--
that's--that's me.

30:39.905 --> 30:42.875
The breathing helps with the--

30:45.444 --> 30:47.880
Oh, shit!

30:49.615 --> 30:52.551
- Somebody's feeling better.

30:52.585 --> 30:54.186
Fuck.

30:54.220 --> 30:56.622
- Back from the dead.

30:56.855 --> 31:00.326
My God.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.027
- Hey.
- Hmm?

31:02.061 --> 31:06.432
I had cancer, and you lightin'
up coal in my fucking face?

31:06.465 --> 31:08.234
I'm sorry. You're right.

31:08.267 --> 31:10.869
That is fucked up.

31:10.903 --> 31:14.406
Oh, shit, I'm late.
Got to pick up my son.

31:17.443 --> 31:20.012
He's a teenager now, right?

31:20.045 --> 31:22.081
A mean-ager.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.483
No, that's what we call 'em,
'cause when they turn 16,

31:24.516 --> 31:27.219
they forget
that they ever even liked you.

31:27.253 --> 31:28.520
Let me ask you somethin'.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.055
<i>Hmm?</i>

31:31.423 --> 31:33.325
How does he feel
about what you do?

31:34.560 --> 31:36.562
What do I do?

31:36.595 --> 31:38.397
You know, your line of work.

31:38.430 --> 31:41.967
My son thinks that I'm
a barber that does house calls.

31:43.168 --> 31:45.237
I got the scissors
and robes and everything.

31:49.141 --> 31:51.910
Wow, that's good.

31:51.944 --> 31:54.546
I bet you he got it
figured out, though.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.915
You know,
these kids ain't dumb.

31:56.949 --> 31:58.083
It ain't like he gonna
bring it up to you

31:58.117 --> 31:59.184
or nothing like that,

31:59.218 --> 32:00.653
'cause that's
a fucked-up conversation

32:00.686 --> 32:02.621
<i>to have with your own moms.</i>

32:02.655 --> 32:05.291
Maybe you're right, Malcolm.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.393
Maybe he does know.

32:07.426 --> 32:10.929
Maybe my son knows that, yeah,
Mommy turns tricks.

32:10.963 --> 32:12.298
Wait, wait, wait,
I didn't mean it like--

32:12.331 --> 32:13.932
But you know what else
he knows?

32:13.966 --> 32:16.035
My son knows
that I would die for him,

32:16.068 --> 32:17.636
that I would lay down my life
for his,

32:17.670 --> 32:20.472
and at the end of the day,
that's all he needs to know

32:20.506 --> 32:22.641
'cause that's all
that really matters.

32:29.148 --> 32:31.016
I--

33:16.495 --> 33:18.997
- What'd you hear?
- Nothin'.

33:19.031 --> 33:22.167
I went by the shop...
and his girl's.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.603
Nobody around right now.

33:24.636 --> 33:28.140
I really don't know
if this is 'Nique.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.075
I mean...

33:30.109 --> 33:32.444
just trying to stay alive.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.213
And fucking with you...

33:34.246 --> 33:36.014
seem like the worst shit
for his health.

33:36.048 --> 33:37.383
One of the reasons
I brought you on

33:37.416 --> 33:39.651
is 'cause I ain't want
no problems with your man.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.387
But now that he fucking
with my shit,

33:41.420 --> 33:43.355
it makes you seem
a whole lot less useful, son.

33:45.057 --> 33:48.594
Move like your life depend
on finding this nigga...

33:48.627 --> 33:50.062
'cause it does.

34:01.407 --> 34:03.442
Nah, no way.

34:03.475 --> 34:04.743
I don't believe
that shit at all.

34:04.777 --> 34:07.079
And that's what I said, Juke.
This nigga's crazy.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.785
I don't know. You think I still
need to ask her anyway, though?

34:14.353 --> 34:17.089
You gonna ask Raq
about being with that cop

34:17.122 --> 34:18.490
like that?

34:18.524 --> 34:21.527
Shit, you right.
What the fuck was I thinking?

34:21.560 --> 34:23.595
Did he say anything
about what went down

34:23.629 --> 34:25.731
between y'all that night?

34:25.764 --> 34:27.065
No.

34:27.099 --> 34:29.268
Oh.

34:29.301 --> 34:30.436
He doesn't remember,

34:30.469 --> 34:32.104
'cause that would've been
the first shit

34:32.137 --> 34:34.239
to come out of his mouth,
so that's good.

34:34.273 --> 34:36.775
- I don't know, Juke. I--

34:36.809 --> 34:38.610
You two been
by the bodega today?

34:38.644 --> 34:39.611
Seen Juliana?

34:39.645 --> 34:41.346
- No.
- Nah.

34:43.282 --> 34:45.551
What y'all talkin' about?

34:45.584 --> 34:46.718
I--

34:46.752 --> 34:50.289
We was just, um, you know...

34:50.322 --> 34:52.591
I'ma go get ready for bed.

34:52.624 --> 34:54.326
See you tomorrow.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.664
- Night, Aunt Raq.
- Mm-hmm. Night, baby.

35:06.872 --> 35:09.475
What's goin' on?

35:09.508 --> 35:11.710
It's the cop.

35:11.743 --> 35:12.811
Howard.

35:12.845 --> 35:14.580
<i>Pulled up on me today.</i>

35:16.582 --> 35:18.250
He said he my father.

35:23.755 --> 35:25.524
This fool.

35:25.557 --> 35:28.160
He was talking
that same craziness to me.

35:28.193 --> 35:29.595
I mean, I thought
it was momentary,

35:29.628 --> 35:31.163
that he was gonna
snap out of it.

35:31.196 --> 35:32.331
Well, he's still saying it, Ma.

35:32.364 --> 35:33.665
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:33.699 --> 35:35.701
You his son, Juke his daughter,
and your uncle Lou-Lou--

35:35.734 --> 35:37.169
- that's his twin brother.
- I'm just saying.

35:37.202 --> 35:38.670
He said he was coming back
around to talk about it--

35:38.704 --> 35:40.572
Yeah, you ain't gonna
tell him nothing.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.407
Let him spit all this shit,
and you keep your mouth shut.

35:42.441 --> 35:43.675
He police.
You don't talk to no police.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.177
And he didn't say anything--

35:45.210 --> 35:47.746
Look, his head is
all messed up, Kanan.

35:47.779 --> 35:51.383
He don't know what's real
and what isn't.

35:51.416 --> 35:53.352
Look, you just keep letting me
know when he step to you

35:53.385 --> 35:55.153
and what he says when he do.

35:55.187 --> 35:56.522
And if he get any stupider,

35:56.555 --> 35:58.757
I'm gonna get in the middle
of it.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.859
That's part of the reason why
I asked you to do what you did.

36:00.893 --> 36:02.928
Howard,
he's always been unstable

36:03.161 --> 36:04.429
and unpredictable and shit.

36:04.463 --> 36:07.199
Never know what wildness
he gonna say or do.

36:09.568 --> 36:12.471
Look, you just need
to keep your head down.

36:12.504 --> 36:15.507
He gonna forget about you.

36:15.541 --> 36:16.842
That's how he do.

36:26.752 --> 36:28.420
I heard about Scrappy.

36:29.922 --> 36:32.524
Yeah.

36:32.558 --> 36:35.327
I meant to talk
to you about that,

36:35.360 --> 36:36.628
but I got distracted.

36:36.662 --> 36:39.398
That don't make
no kind of sense, Mom.

36:39.431 --> 36:40.866
Scrappy killin' hisself?

36:40.899 --> 36:42.668
It don't ever
make no sense, Kanan.

36:42.701 --> 36:46.738
It's hard to understand
how somebody could just get

36:46.772 --> 36:49.708
to a point where they
don't want to live anymore.

36:49.741 --> 36:51.577
Look, everybody got
their shit, Kanan,

36:51.610 --> 36:54.413
and everybody
deal with it different.

36:54.446 --> 36:56.448
Scrap made his decision.

36:56.481 --> 36:59.918
And it hurts for all of us
he left, but it was his call.

36:59.952 --> 37:01.553
<i>It's what he wanted.</i>

37:01.587 --> 37:04.756
So let's just remember him
for who he was...

37:04.790 --> 37:06.592
how he wanted us to.

37:19.504 --> 37:21.773
Thanks for coming.

37:21.807 --> 37:25.243
When I called,
I- I wasn't sure--

37:25.277 --> 37:27.245
<i>Yeah, you broke my heart.</i>

37:27.279 --> 37:30.482
But that doesn't mean
I never want to see you again.

37:30.515 --> 37:32.784
I always want to see you, Shannon.

37:32.818 --> 37:33.819
That's the problem.

37:38.690 --> 37:40.826
How's your mom?

37:40.859 --> 37:43.962
M.S. isn't a disease
that gets better.

37:43.996 --> 37:46.732
I'm having to pay out of pocket
for a home health aide

37:46.765 --> 37:48.667
and put ramps in her home,
some of her meds.

37:48.700 --> 37:49.768
I'm so sorry, Adina.

37:49.801 --> 37:51.536
Is there anything
I can do to help?

37:51.570 --> 37:52.971
If you got 50 grand
burning a hole in your pocket,

37:53.005 --> 37:54.473
I could put it
to some good use.

37:56.008 --> 37:58.744
But you didn't hit me up
to talk about my mom.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.346
No, it's my, uh--
it's my partner.

38:01.380 --> 38:04.349
- I heard Howard's on the mend.
- Yeah, he's doing better.

38:04.383 --> 38:05.717
You know, he's taking
better care of himself.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.653
He stopped smoking.
He's eating right.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.521
He's nicer to me
than he's ever been before.

38:09.554 --> 38:10.856
What's the problem, then?

38:10.889 --> 38:12.924
'Cause Howard's always
been a world-class dick.

38:14.626 --> 38:18.330
Him being nicer sounds like a
dramatic change for the better.

38:18.363 --> 38:22.067
He's got secrets, Adina,

38:22.300 --> 38:23.435
a lot of them.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.404
We all have secrets.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.973
In fact, if memory serves,
I was yours.

38:28.006 --> 38:29.074
That was the issue.

38:31.943 --> 38:34.579
He says he doesn't remember
anything about the shooting,

38:34.613 --> 38:36.448
but I don't know
if I believe him.

38:36.481 --> 38:37.716
It feels like
there's more there,

38:37.749 --> 38:39.484
but whenever I try digging,
he gets pissed at me

38:39.518 --> 38:40.719
and tells me to leave it alone.

38:40.752 --> 38:42.020
I remember working with him

38:42.054 --> 38:44.556
on this Subway Slasher
task force back in the day.

38:44.589 --> 38:46.625
Howard's got a lot of pride.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.760
He has a tough time
letting people help him,

38:48.794 --> 38:50.462
especially women.

38:52.631 --> 38:55.500
But I get it.
You're his partner.

38:55.534 --> 38:58.637
You're supposed
to look out for him.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.706
Thanks.

39:00.739 --> 39:03.341
At least someone understands.

39:03.375 --> 39:05.877
I always understood you.

39:08.413 --> 39:09.815
Yeah, I know you did.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.903
Nothin'.

39:31.937 --> 39:33.672
Nobody's seen 'Nique.

39:33.705 --> 39:37.442
Sometimes obvious shit
is obvious 'cause it's right.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.612
Juliana hit us herself.

39:43.648 --> 39:45.083
It's Juke.

39:47.152 --> 39:49.020
She good.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.956
She been good, Marvin.

39:55.994 --> 39:58.597
Yeah, she, uh--

40:01.600 --> 40:04.035
She ever ask about me?

40:12.477 --> 40:14.446
I fucked it all up, Lou.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.519
Yeah, you did.

40:21.787 --> 40:23.722
Whatever.

40:23.755 --> 40:26.591
We got to go find our shit.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.193
I'll circle back
with you later.

40:28.426 --> 40:29.995
- Hey.
- No.

40:37.068 --> 40:39.638
Keep sitting on Juliana's crib.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.706
And call me if you see--
you hear anything.

40:52.684 --> 40:55.954
All that shit we sold,
I still can't afford a place.

40:55.987 --> 40:57.823
We gonna have
to hit them corners.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.791
Ah, I don't think we'll be able

40:59.825 --> 41:01.593
to grab some more work
for a little bit.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.695
Niggas is definitely
gonna start noticing.

41:04.796 --> 41:08.099
- What's up, fellas?
-  What's up?

41:08.133 --> 41:10.468
Raq home?

41:10.502 --> 41:11.870
Yeah, she inside.

41:18.944 --> 41:20.979
Lookin' at cribs?

41:21.012 --> 41:24.249
Yeah, man.
Fuckin' mom kicked me out.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.917
I'm sleepin' at the goddamn Y.

41:25.951 --> 41:27.652
Famous all homeless and shit.

41:27.686 --> 41:29.754
Now, that's what you need to be
writing some rhymes about.

41:29.788 --> 41:32.057
For real.

41:34.693 --> 41:36.728
Yo, check this out.

41:37.729 --> 41:38.797
I've been hookin' up
this brother

41:38.830 --> 41:40.098
with free studio time
for his girl,

41:40.131 --> 41:42.834
and I know they got
some buildings around the way.

41:42.868 --> 41:45.237
Let me talk to him,
see if he want to hook you up,

41:45.270 --> 41:46.938
- show you some love.
- Word?

41:46.972 --> 41:49.107
I ain't promise you nothing,
but I could for sure ask.

41:49.140 --> 41:51.209
I mean,
I can pay you somethin',

41:51.243 --> 41:52.911
not a lot, but, like,

41:52.944 --> 41:55.914
I got this cash that me and K
hustled up, man, like--

41:55.947 --> 41:59.050
Like I said, I'ma ask.

41:59.084 --> 42:01.620
These ain't exactly
your Jamaica Estates, though.

42:01.653 --> 42:05.657
Psh. It's better than getting
my dick grabbed at the Y.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.993
- You saved my life, brother,

42:08.026 --> 42:10.929
Like, come--come here.
Come here.

42:10.962 --> 42:13.798
Thank you.

42:13.832 --> 42:16.001
That's real man shit
right there.

42:16.034 --> 42:18.003
I told your sister
I was gonna look out for you.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.605
Oh, but you is--
you a man of your word,

42:20.639 --> 42:22.140
my brother,
and I'ma tell her that,

42:22.173 --> 42:23.842
if I ever speak
to her ass again.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.044
- Y'all a trip.

42:26.077 --> 42:28.079
All right, now.

42:28.113 --> 42:29.948
That is my nigga.

42:29.981 --> 42:31.750
Let me see that.

42:39.624 --> 42:42.127
- Lou ain't here.
-  I ain't here for Lou.

42:42.160 --> 42:43.895
Look, I ain't got time
for you right now, Crown.

42:43.929 --> 42:46.798
I think I got a solution
to a problem we both havin'...

42:46.831 --> 42:48.633
with Lou.

43:06.718 --> 43:10.055
You and me better off if Lou
wasn't in the music business.

43:12.090 --> 43:13.792
I'm listening.

43:13.825 --> 43:15.627
What if I sold you
part of the label

43:15.660 --> 43:17.295
for damn near nothing?

43:17.329 --> 43:20.298
Let you wash all the money
you want through it.

43:20.332 --> 43:23.201
In return, let's get Lou out
the studio, back on the street.

43:23.234 --> 43:24.803
- That's where he belong.

43:24.836 --> 43:27.772
Hello? All right, well,
I'ma meet you there, then.

43:27.806 --> 43:29.874
I ain't got time for you right
now, Crown--you got to go.

43:29.908 --> 43:31.309
Oh, but Lou will kill me

43:31.343 --> 43:32.978
if he knew I stepped to you
like this.

43:33.011 --> 43:34.312
Lou ain't gonna know shit.

44:10.348 --> 44:12.684
How we know this
motherfucker not setting us up?

44:12.717 --> 44:14.285
Maybe you and 'Nique
taxed our shit.

44:14.319 --> 44:17.022
'Nique called me,
said he want to talk to Raq.

44:17.055 --> 44:18.089
I'm with y'all now.

44:18.123 --> 44:19.657
I ain't in business
with him no more.

44:19.691 --> 44:21.026
There's better ways
to get to talking

44:21.059 --> 44:23.094
than grabbing up all our shit
and our connect's cousin.

44:23.128 --> 44:24.662
You here, though.

44:24.696 --> 44:26.698
And I bet you ready to talk.

44:26.731 --> 44:28.133
We ready.

44:28.166 --> 44:30.235
But I ain't promising
all we gonna do is talk.

44:30.268 --> 44:31.369
Let's go.

44:33.238 --> 44:34.873
You through
the door first, nigga.

45:12.277 --> 45:15.914
Good to see you, too, Raq.

45:15.947 --> 45:19.117
You must really want
to die, 'Nique.

45:19.150 --> 45:22.120
I missed the hell
out of you, girl.

45:36.801 --> 45:39.737
<i>-♪ What a blessedness ♪</i>
-  <i>♪ Oh, blessedness ♪</i>

45:56.821 --> 46:01.960
-  ♪ From all alarms ♪

46:01.993 --> 46:05.096
-♪ Leaning ♪
-  ♪ I'm leaning ♪

46:05.130 --> 46:08.299
-  ♪ Mm ♪

46:44.269 --> 46:45.904
I just want to talk. That's it.

46:45.937 --> 46:47.939
You ever heard
of pickin' up a phone, nigga?

46:47.972 --> 46:50.475
You know I got to
make you work for it, baby.

46:50.508 --> 46:53.144
Besides,
I knew you knew it was me,

46:53.178 --> 46:56.414
being that we be
on the same page like that.

46:56.447 --> 46:58.183
I don't know what book
you reading from, nigga,

46:58.216 --> 47:00.451
but it ain't looking like you
gonna live happily ever after.

47:00.485 --> 47:03.021
If you want your money,
you'll hear me out.

47:03.054 --> 47:05.957
If not...

47:05.990 --> 47:08.826
do what the fuck
you will, then.

47:08.860 --> 47:10.228
Talk.

47:10.261 --> 47:12.597
But Worrell's just a messenger.

47:12.830 --> 47:15.967
I'm the motherfuckin' message.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.402
<i>You know,
it was cute back there</i>

47:17.435 --> 47:19.504
what you did
framing me for Howard.

47:19.537 --> 47:21.372
Don't matter I ain't do it.

47:21.406 --> 47:24.209
I can't even put up a fuckin'
lemonade stand on the block

47:24.242 --> 47:27.212
without them trying
to put me back in.

47:29.113 --> 47:31.316
So you all salty
'cause you got beat?

47:31.349 --> 47:34.385
That's what the fuck this is?

47:34.419 --> 47:36.054
Take the loss
like a fuckin' man.

47:36.087 --> 47:39.891
I ain't even gonna front, Raq.
My business is done.

47:39.924 --> 47:41.626
<i>My name ain't even got
the same weight</i>

47:41.859 --> 47:43.194
<i>on these streets no more.</i>

47:44.862 --> 47:46.497
You won.

47:46.531 --> 47:48.099
For real, you did it.

47:48.132 --> 47:52.237
But now I just want to be left
the fuck alone.

47:52.270 --> 47:54.339
All right? That's it.

47:54.372 --> 47:56.507
You see what I did here.

47:56.541 --> 47:59.544
<i>So you know
I can still touch you, baby.</i>

47:59.577 --> 48:01.512
You know I can still
make problems for you

48:01.546 --> 48:03.414
and these fucking Colombians.

48:05.984 --> 48:08.219
I just want my family safe.

48:08.253 --> 48:11.089
Peace for me and mines, Raq.

48:11.122 --> 48:15.260
Nigga want peace, so he rob us.

48:15.293 --> 48:16.961
Fuck kind of peace is that?

48:16.995 --> 48:19.364
The real kind, nigga,

48:19.397 --> 48:21.199
the kind that got
a price on it.

48:21.232 --> 48:24.569
Go post up somewhere else that
ain't the Southside, 'Nique.

48:24.602 --> 48:27.639
Big world, nigga.
Everywhere got a corner.

48:27.672 --> 48:30.208
And everywhere got a Unique,

48:30.241 --> 48:31.976
maybe even a Raq.

48:32.010 --> 48:33.645
Southside home.

48:33.678 --> 48:36.381
That's all a nigga know.

48:36.414 --> 48:40.618
Besides,
I'm retired now, y'all.

48:40.652 --> 48:44.188
Jersey in the rafters.

48:44.222 --> 48:46.057
I just want to live
my life now.

48:46.090 --> 48:49.527
If we put him down,
everyone gonna know it was us,

48:49.560 --> 48:51.262
including five-O.

48:53.531 --> 48:57.101
Yo, this motherfucker
tried to kill you.

48:57.135 --> 48:59.170
And we tried to kill him.

48:59.203 --> 49:02.473
It ain't personal for me, Marv.

49:02.507 --> 49:04.275
Personal for you, 'Nique?

49:04.309 --> 49:06.611
Never was, brother.

49:06.644 --> 49:08.646
Never was.

49:11.683 --> 49:12.717
Give me your gat.

49:22.527 --> 49:24.095
You got your peace, 'Nique.

49:29.033 --> 49:31.569
Now give me my fuckin' money.

49:48.720 --> 49:50.188
What up, B?

49:55.560 --> 49:58.296
<i>Yo, what your mom's
talking about?</i>

49:58.329 --> 50:00.431
Oh, let me guess.

50:00.465 --> 50:03.634
I done lost my damn mind.
I got amnesia.

50:03.668 --> 50:06.037
I don't know what's real
and what's not.

50:10.608 --> 50:12.276
But see, I ain't crazy.

50:14.545 --> 50:17.615
I remember everything.

50:17.648 --> 50:20.451
You little motherfucker,
you shot me.

50:22.153 --> 50:23.755
And I took that bullet
from you,

50:23.788 --> 50:26.357
and now I'ma take one for you.

50:26.391 --> 50:30.228
I ain't telling nobody about
what happened in the park.

50:30.261 --> 50:32.530
I wouldn't do that to my son.

50:40.271 --> 50:41.739
<i>Remember when I said the truth</i>

50:41.773 --> 50:44.041
<i>was like that J train?</i>

50:44.075 --> 50:46.644
<i>I was wrong about that.</i>

50:46.677 --> 50:50.047
<i>The truth is more like
that Metro-North shit...</i>

50:50.081 --> 50:51.716
<i>...fast, heavy...</i>

50:51.749 --> 50:53.684
<i>...pulling a lot of weight.</i>

50:53.718 --> 50:55.586
<i>And that shit
pick up speed, too.</i>

50:56.788 --> 50:59.390
<i>That's the truth coming
for you, nigga.</i>

50:59.424 --> 51:02.093
<i>And it hit hard,
and it hit fast,</i>

51:02.126 --> 51:03.661
<i>so look the fuck out.</i>
