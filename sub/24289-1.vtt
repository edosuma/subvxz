<i>It's time to strike.</i>

00:11.428 --> 00:13.263
<i>Attack. Disrupt. Destroy.</i>

00:15.015 --> 00:19.228
<i>All technology, computers, games, cameras,
phones, they're all targets.</i>

00:21.939 --> 00:23.357
<i>The internet isn't safe.</i>

00:25.400 --> 00:26.443
<i>It's vulnerable.</i>

00:26.526 --> 00:28.779
<i>So are the people who use it every day.</i>

00:31.448 --> 00:33.367
My plan is in motion.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.202
It can't be stopped.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.120
I won't be stopped.

00:37.829 --> 00:41.166
And humanity has no idea what's coming.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.012
Summer is officially over, Armstrong.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.850
And winter can't come soon enough.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.982
Alan Turing High.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.652
Only the most tech-progressive
school in the city.

01:08.944 --> 01:10.445
Am I happy to be here?

01:10.862 --> 01:11.905
We'll see.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.157
Change can be good, right?

01:14.491 --> 01:17.911
Or maybe today will rank way up
there on the Lame-O-Meter.

01:17.995 --> 01:20.998
Stay tuned. Tamra says out.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.441
This is my house now.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.151
Yes.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.530
Still top ranking.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.576
It's you!

01:57.951 --> 01:59.202
TamraSez!

01:59.703 --> 02:01.622
You go to my school? This school?

02:01.705 --> 02:04.374
Uh, yes. Just transferred here.

02:04.458 --> 02:08.294
Wow, this is so random but at the same
time so perfect, you know?

02:08.961 --> 02:10.005
I'm Cherie.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.007
I've been following your vlog
for, like, ever.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.301
You are my absolute hero!

02:14.926 --> 02:19.264
It's just me talking about stuff.
I'm not really doing anything heroic.

02:19.348 --> 02:21.576
You know what I loved?
Your post about the first day of school.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.101
I watched it, like, five times.

02:23.769 --> 02:26.438
How is that even possible?
I just uploaded it.

02:26.521 --> 02:29.816
I know! Lame-O-Meter? You are so funny.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.110
This is gonna be such a good year.

02:32.694 --> 02:33.904
Selfie!

02:36.031 --> 02:37.115
Ha!

02:37.991 --> 02:40.661
Austin, where have you been?
The bell's about to ring.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.120
Relax, Parker.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.458
Nothing happens on the first day
of school.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.251
This is Alan Turing High.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.296
I bet we start coding,
designing tech right away.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.257
Today's gonna be amazing. I can feel it.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.551
You know what I feel?

02:57.844 --> 02:59.429
- Pressure.
- Why?

03:00.430 --> 03:01.473
Why do you think?

03:02.599 --> 03:04.267
Because your dad taught here?

03:04.726 --> 03:05.811
Uh, yeah.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.022
Everybody's gonna expect me to be smart.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.148
Like him.

03:10.482 --> 03:11.482
Like you.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.526
You're smart, Austin.

03:12.943 --> 03:14.903
- In your own way.
- Gee, thanks, buddy.

03:18.281 --> 03:21.660
There. A fabric of cyber space.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.537
It's weak.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.623
Ah, that's the spot. Easy to tear.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.000
Tear a hole, an opening.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.796
A rift.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.192
Yes.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.320
Yes, good.

03:58.113 --> 04:03.368
The beginning is now.
This is where it starts.

04:04.536 --> 04:05.579
Plague.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.707
Hungry cyber locusts.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.585
They will consume everything
in their path.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.017
Dark code detected.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.189
Commencing ReBoot program.

04:32.272 --> 04:36.318
Activating next generation guardians.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.281
- Room zero.
- Room zero?

04:47.245 --> 04:49.080
Our homeroom is in the basement?

04:49.998 --> 04:51.249
That's what the map says.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.130
Hey.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.925
You looking for room zero?

05:00.675 --> 05:03.553
Yeah, but there is nothing here.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.474
Am I late?

05:07.766 --> 05:08.975
Is this room zero?

05:09.810 --> 05:11.269
It's supposed to be.

05:12.229 --> 05:15.148
I've never heard of a school
having a room zero before.

05:15.524 --> 05:17.567
Well, if you look at it
from a binary perspective,

05:17.651 --> 05:18.568
most room numbers contain at least one...

05:18.652 --> 05:19.736
Parker.

05:20.570 --> 05:21.822
You two know each other?

05:22.113 --> 05:23.198
Unfortunately.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.826
I'm Austin and this is Parker.

05:26.535 --> 05:28.578
Trey. Nice to meet you.

05:28.829 --> 05:29.871
I'm Tamra.

05:30.497 --> 05:33.291
So, should we just report to the office?

05:33.375 --> 05:35.001
Wait. Look at your phones.

05:36.253 --> 05:39.047
We're not there yet. It's over here.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.759
Parker, there's no room here.
It's just a...

05:48.390 --> 05:49.432
What?

05:56.982 --> 05:58.149
Austin?

06:11.871 --> 06:12.914
Austin?

06:14.874 --> 06:16.293
That doesn't make sense.

06:20.422 --> 06:21.673
Where did he go?

06:26.886 --> 06:29.264
I guess it's our turn?

06:39.274 --> 06:40.317
Whoa.

06:41.610 --> 06:42.986
What is this place?

06:47.532 --> 06:48.908
Look at all this tech.

06:51.202 --> 06:56.333
This is officially the strangest
first day of school ever.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.627
Yeah, no kidding.

07:04.883 --> 07:05.883
Look, look.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.720
It's the ReBoot logo from
the Cyber Guardian game.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.597
Cyber Guardians?

07:12.015 --> 07:15.518
Maybe we get our own special homeroom,
because we're unbeatable in the game.

07:15.602 --> 07:16.645
Maybe.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.189
Excuse me, but my team's unbeatable.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.901
No, my team holds the top ranking.

07:23.777 --> 07:24.819
No.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.489
Me and Austin and our two friends,

07:27.572 --> 07:31.117
well, not exactly friends
because we've never met them for real.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.078
We know them by their gamer names:

07:33.161 --> 07:34.722
D-Frag and Enigma
but we have the highest...

07:34.746 --> 07:35.746
Googz.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.001
You've gotta be Googz.

07:42.504 --> 07:43.672
Enigma.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.883
Let me guess.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.008
D-Frag?

07:49.344 --> 07:50.387
Vector.

07:50.637 --> 07:51.637
Yeah.

07:52.013 --> 07:54.891
Okay, so this must have something
to do with the game.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.570
There's gotta be some way to log in.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.453
Cool!

08:18.331 --> 08:20.291
Hey, quit touching stuff.

08:26.673 --> 08:27.673
Whoa.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.467
What is that?

08:34.347 --> 08:37.100
Hey, those are our Cyber Guardian avatars.

08:46.818 --> 08:50.071
I knew this school was gonna be cool,
but this is incredible.

09:41.790 --> 09:42.957
Whoa.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.834
What just happened?

09:45.585 --> 09:46.586
I don't know.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.841
But this might be the best
virtual reality experience ever.

09:52.342 --> 09:55.053
Oh man, that does not feel good.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.239
Who'd have thought you'd be
the wimp of the group?

09:57.263 --> 09:58.473
Shut it, Vector.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.559
Guardians.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.853
Your mission has commenced.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.105
Follow me.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.188
Wait.

10:06.648 --> 10:07.649
Who are you?

10:07.732 --> 10:12.362
I am the virtual evolutionary
recombinant avatar.

10:12.570 --> 10:13.780
V.E.R.A.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.783
Can we call you Vera for short?

10:17.200 --> 10:19.244
That would be appropriate.

10:20.703 --> 10:21.996
She said follow her.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.126
Open world. Sweet.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.961
This is the Codec.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.171
We get a ship.

10:30.839 --> 10:31.839
Bonus.

10:32.173 --> 10:35.510
It is your command post
and your transfer station.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.721
Uh, I'm not too crazy
about that transfer part.

10:38.805 --> 10:39.805
Wimp.

10:39.848 --> 10:42.225
Initiating gateway access.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.601
Hey!

10:46.187 --> 10:47.272
What the-

10:50.692 --> 10:51.693
Whoa!

10:55.655 --> 10:57.407
Ugh, I think I'm gonna puke!

11:02.370 --> 11:03.580
Whoa!

11:06.499 --> 11:07.876
Whoo-hoo!

11:09.627 --> 11:10.753
Phew!

11:14.465 --> 11:16.092
Whoa, what is this place?

11:16.175 --> 11:21.514
It is an electrical power plant under
attack by dark code cyber locusts.

11:21.598 --> 11:22.599
Whoa.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.434
Ugh, nasty.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.110
Everything's in place.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.614
The cyber locusts are destroying
the power grid.

11:38.948 --> 11:42.160
It's time to send humanity back
to the dark ages.

11:42.911 --> 11:48.625
In three... two... one.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.220
<i>Massive power outages swept
through the United Kingdom.</i>

12:01.304 --> 12:03.056
<i>The cause is unknown.</i>

12:03.348 --> 12:04.474
Perfect.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.810
My plan is working.

12:09.270 --> 12:14.192
<i>Guardians, your mission
is to destroy the dark code cyber locusts.</i>

12:14.901 --> 12:17.987
Enigma, Googz, D-Frag, we got this.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.071
Absolutely.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.406
Right behind you, Vector.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.036
Come on. This way.

12:25.119 --> 12:28.539
Quick question. We don't have
our controllers how do we use our weapons?

12:28.623 --> 12:30.041
Maybe we just call it out?

12:30.124 --> 12:31.167
Code disruptor!

12:34.379 --> 12:36.589
That's it! We're the controllers!

12:36.673 --> 12:38.967
Time for a bug splatter party.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.051
Game on!

12:43.388 --> 12:44.389
Fright fists!

12:49.852 --> 12:52.313
Alright! Who's next? Come get some!

13:02.991 --> 13:04.325
Enigma, incoming!

13:05.368 --> 13:06.577
Energy shurikens!

13:11.874 --> 13:14.210
That didn't feel like virtual reality.

13:14.419 --> 13:17.547
That felt like real reality.

13:18.089 --> 13:20.341
Vera? This is a game, right?

13:20.591 --> 13:21.467
False.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.886
It is the Guardian Code ReBoot Program.

13:24.220 --> 13:28.933
<i>The Cyber Guardian game served
as your phase one training platform.</i>

13:29.183 --> 13:30.183
What are you saying?

13:30.226 --> 13:34.272
<i>I was programmed to activate
the next generation guardians</i>

13:34.355 --> 13:36.524
<i>if ever dark code appeared.</i>

13:38.151 --> 13:39.777
Hold on. Back up a second.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.447
What is this "dark code"
you keep talking about?

13:42.530 --> 13:46.451
A most malicious virus,
these cyber locusts contain it.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.996
If it is permitted to spread
this universe could be consumed

13:50.079 --> 13:53.041
by dark code and eliminated forever.

13:53.124 --> 13:57.920
Right now the cyber locusts are affecting
electricity in your world.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.088
Our world?

13:59.172 --> 14:00.774
We're actually in the internet right now?

14:00.798 --> 14:01.883
Affirmative.

14:01.966 --> 14:05.094
Everything you see and touch
is made of code.

14:06.304 --> 14:07.138
Firewall!

14:07.221 --> 14:10.600
The cyber locusts,
the Codec, your suits.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.519
But inside the suits
we're still flesh and blood?

14:13.603 --> 14:15.813
Affirmative. You are humans.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.648
So we could actually get hurt?

14:18.024 --> 14:19.067
We could even die?

14:19.275 --> 14:20.109
Affirmative.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.111
We gotta make sure that doesn't happen.

14:24.739 --> 14:25.740
Vector, look out!

14:28.242 --> 14:29.994
Vector suit breech imminent.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.997
Survival probability 30 percent.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.415
That doesn't sound good!

14:35.375 --> 14:36.375
Booster pack!

14:40.338 --> 14:41.923
How's that for a one-two punch?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.051
What's this?

14:45.176 --> 14:46.928
Anti-virus software.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.722
I expected it. Not surprising.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.849
But it's not gonna stop me.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.189
There's too many of them.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.493
Look, we've never lost
in the game.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.027
What would we do
if we were playing right now?

15:03.111 --> 15:04.791
The first thing we'd do is plug that hole.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.323
Good thinking, Googz.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.283
One cyber patch coming up.

15:13.913 --> 15:14.914
Nice one, Googz.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.124
Zip board!

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Yeah!

15:33.182 --> 15:34.225
What?

15:35.059 --> 15:37.103
Access denied? Impossible.

15:38.187 --> 15:43.151
My access can't be denied.
I made the rift. I created the access.

15:43.484 --> 15:47.196
Okay, now we just have to do something
about the rest of the cyber locusts.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.824
What about that move we pulled
in the game a few days ago.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.368
Yeah, this place is pulsing
with electricity.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.870
We can make that work for us.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.746
Alright, I'll give it a try.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.541
Let's hope these cyber locusts play along.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.963
Come on, you ugly bugs!
Catch me if you can!

16:12.346 --> 16:13.473
Coming through!

16:31.782 --> 16:32.867
It's working!

16:34.702 --> 16:36.913
Okay, D-Frag, do your thing!

16:36.996 --> 16:38.164
Oh, yeah!

16:39.373 --> 16:40.373
Mag Frag!

16:50.593 --> 16:51.636
No!

16:52.011 --> 16:53.011
Vector!

16:54.805 --> 16:55.890
He's gone.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.352
He can't be.

17:01.062 --> 17:03.105
- You guys looking for me?
- Vector!

17:03.189 --> 17:04.607
You're okay!

17:04.732 --> 17:07.902
Of course, I wasn't gonna let some
giant bug zapper take me out.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.571
- Nice work, D-Frag.
- Thanks.

17:11.821 --> 17:13.031
Guess we're still undefeated.

17:13.991 --> 17:14.992
Alright!

17:15.076 --> 17:16.285
Whoo-hoo!

17:16.827 --> 17:18.119
Sweet!

17:22.250 --> 17:23.334
No!

17:24.835 --> 17:26.002
Impossible!

17:29.006 --> 17:30.591
It's a lot more real when it's real.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.093
That was so rad.

17:32.218 --> 17:36.639
Guardians, you successfully completed
your first mission.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.892
It is time for you to return
to your world.

17:40.268 --> 17:41.852
That's it? We're done?

17:41.936 --> 17:42.979
Affirmative.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.814
But I have so many questions.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.692
It is time for you to return
to your world.

17:47.775 --> 17:49.610
Okay, okay. We heard you.

17:49.694 --> 17:52.947
I can provide whatever answers
my cache memory holds

17:53.030 --> 17:54.490
the next time you are needed.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.616
Next time?

17:55.700 --> 17:57.410
You expect us to do this again?

17:57.493 --> 17:59.333
Yeah, I don't know if my stomach
can handle it.

18:10.381 --> 18:11.966
So do we keep this quiet?

18:12.049 --> 18:13.718
Just between us four?

18:13.968 --> 18:17.930
Right, because if we told people
that we found a secret room

18:18.014 --> 18:20.850
hidden behind a hologram wall
where we can go into the internet

18:20.933 --> 18:23.603
in special suits made of code
and fight cyber locusts

18:25.271 --> 18:26.856
they'd totally believe us.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.613
Second period's about to start.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.907
I gotta go.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.670
Nothing happens
on the first day of school?

18:54.717 --> 18:58.012
Okay, so I was wrong about that.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.056
<i>This just in.</i>

19:24.080 --> 19:26.624
<i>The mysterious power outage
in the UK is over.</i>

19:26.707 --> 19:28.751
<i>Electricity has been fully restored.</i>

19:28.834 --> 19:31.087
I won't be defeated!

19:45.434 --> 19:48.729
Let's start with a few simple questions.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.898
Let me see...

19:51.982 --> 19:54.151
Austin Carter, please stand.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.657
Was Adam Carter your father?

19:59.740 --> 20:01.075
Uh, yes.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.202
He was.

20:03.327 --> 20:06.330
So sorry for your loss, Austin.
He was a fine teacher.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.540
Thanks.

20:07.665 --> 20:11.001
Now, Austin, I'm sure you will know
the answer to this.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.171
Please tell me what an algorithm is.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.509
Algorithm.

20:18.592 --> 20:21.846
A finite set of instructions
performed in a sequence

20:21.929 --> 20:23.806
to achieve an end result.

20:24.724 --> 20:25.724
That's right.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.309
Who are you?

20:29.645 --> 20:30.938
They call me Vera.

20:31.272 --> 20:34.024
I'm the virtual evolutionary recombinant...

20:34.108 --> 20:36.402
Uh, she's an exchange student.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.696
Just transferred here?

20:40.573 --> 20:42.324
Your name is not on the class list.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.247
Please consult your list again.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.267
Oh, well, there it is.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.291
Uh, okay.

20:51.709 --> 20:52.835
You can take your seats.

20:53.085 --> 20:58.215
Just a sec, everyone, while I add Vera
to the curriculum distribution list.

21:03.888 --> 21:06.307
Vera, how did you get here?

21:06.474 --> 21:08.726
I was not programmed to join
you at this time,

21:09.226 --> 21:12.605
but the bio-constructor
in room zero was activated.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.109
I might have accidentally set that off.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.821
Should we send you back?

21:21.864 --> 21:23.032
No.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.992
I cannot return to cyberspace.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.828
This is now my form.

21:28.329 --> 21:29.747
You mean you're here,

21:30.414 --> 21:31.499
like this,

21:32.625 --> 21:34.293
- for good?
- Yes.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.588
And I think I'm going to like it.
