WEBVTT

00:06.370 --> 00:07.350
ROSA:
Who are all these people?

00:07.550 --> 00:09.520
That's our...

00:09.720 --> 00:12.640
and now your family, Rosa.

00:13.540 --> 00:16.060
Anastasia Kolcheck...
(chuckles)

00:16.260 --> 00:17.160
...will you marry me?

00:17.360 --> 00:18.830
Of course I will.

00:19.030 --> 00:20.800
I'm just doing the best I can
to take care of you.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.140
I don't know how long
I have, but

00:23.340 --> 00:25.040
I'm gonna live it

00:25.240 --> 00:27.140
as full of life as it can be.

00:27.340 --> 00:29.080
I want that, too.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.240
(siren wails)

00:30.440 --> 00:31.540
Out of the car, now!
Hey, whoa.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.350
(grunts)
Hey!
WOMAN: Stop!

00:33.550 --> 00:36.720
I have heard stories
of lost pets

00:36.920 --> 00:40.050
traveling thousands of miles
to find their way home.

00:40.250 --> 00:42.560
You and I need to have a chat.

00:42.760 --> 00:45.690
Where is she?
Let's just say that her great

00:45.890 --> 00:47.330
white whale hunt went south,

00:47.530 --> 00:48.890
and now some others
are paying for it.

00:49.090 --> 00:50.860
Hopefully, she'll be able
to pull another rabbit

00:51.060 --> 00:53.270
out of her hat.
She does have a knack for it.

00:53.470 --> 00:54.980
And if she doesn't?

01:05.160 --> 01:07.560
(glass shatters)

01:28.480 --> 01:30.720
(sensor beeps)

01:56.850 --> 01:58.880
* *

02:14.130 --> 02:16.170
(beeping)

02:26.410 --> 02:28.540
MAN:
Looking for something?

02:30.110 --> 02:31.680
Hands on your head.

02:34.580 --> 02:36.850
Back out slowly.

02:46.530 --> 02:47.830
Stop.

02:53.470 --> 02:56.070
(device beeping rapidly)

02:57.240 --> 02:58.610
(shouts)

03:06.450 --> 03:07.900
(choking)

03:08.100 --> 03:09.850
(grunting)

03:17.430 --> 03:19.130
(groans)

03:20.400 --> 03:22.630
(panting)

03:33.440 --> 03:35.290
(spits)
(pull-ring clatters)

03:35.490 --> 03:36.560
(exhales)

03:36.760 --> 03:39.920
* *

03:59.440 --> 04:00.720
ANNA:
It's your move.

04:00.920 --> 04:04.220
I know, I know.
Don't rush me, please.

04:04.420 --> 04:05.990
It's been ten minutes.

04:06.190 --> 04:07.190
I'm thinking.

04:07.390 --> 04:09.530
Yeah, I can smell
the rubber burning.

04:09.730 --> 04:12.270
You know, the problem here
is your father

04:12.470 --> 04:13.800
insisting on bringing two dates.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.630
I mean, who-who does he think
he is, Hugh Hefner?

04:15.830 --> 04:17.340
Hugh was his hero,

04:17.540 --> 04:20.240
until they banned him
from the Playboy Mansion.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.440
Shocker.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.540
There was an incident...

04:23.740 --> 04:24.910
I-I don't need
to hear the details.

04:25.110 --> 04:27.050
...in the grotto.
What-what did I just say?

04:27.250 --> 04:30.320
I don't want to think about your
father in the Playboy grotto,

04:30.520 --> 04:32.650
and...

04:32.850 --> 04:34.750
now I can't stop
thinking about it.

04:34.950 --> 04:36.200
Thank you very much.

04:37.570 --> 04:39.160
It was their
Halloween party.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.430
Please stop.

04:40.630 --> 04:43.000
(clears throat) Okay. So...

04:43.200 --> 04:46.500
You don't want to know
what his costume was?

04:46.700 --> 04:48.050
No.

04:50.390 --> 04:51.470
It was pretty bad, wasn't it?

04:51.670 --> 04:52.840
(chuckles)

04:53.040 --> 04:55.610
Let's just say
it was peak Britney era

04:55.810 --> 04:57.080
and there were heels

04:57.280 --> 05:00.250
and a live boa constrictor
involved.

05:00.450 --> 05:02.480
(cell phone buzzing)
Oh.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.230
Thank you, God. (clears throat)

05:05.730 --> 05:07.920
Hello?

05:08.120 --> 05:09.970
Yes?

05:11.140 --> 05:14.240
Oh, no, is-is everyone
all right?

05:15.480 --> 05:18.160
Okay, um...
I-Is there

05:18.360 --> 05:20.030
a backup plan?

05:20.230 --> 05:23.600
No, no, o-of course.
No, I understand.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.750
Thank you.

05:28.020 --> 05:30.240
We... (clears throat)

05:30.440 --> 05:31.910
...we just lost our band.

05:32.110 --> 05:35.050
Two of the members, they were
involved in a car accident.

05:35.250 --> 05:38.020
They are going to
be okay, but...

05:38.220 --> 05:41.040
but they can't
perform. (sighs)

05:41.840 --> 05:43.420
We should've hired
that wedding planner.

05:43.620 --> 05:45.860
No, I-I would have
shot myself by now.

05:46.060 --> 05:48.030
(sighs) No, come on,
she-she wasn't that bad.

05:48.230 --> 05:51.700
She's... paid to be... perky.

05:51.900 --> 05:54.220
Way too much perk.

05:55.550 --> 05:58.170
Look, honey...

05:58.370 --> 05:59.410
Come on.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.370
Just breathe.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.540
Okay?
Mm-hmm.

06:03.740 --> 06:05.710
It's all gonna work out.

06:05.910 --> 06:07.610
I promise you.

06:07.810 --> 06:10.300
It always does.

06:11.970 --> 06:13.670
SAM: Come on. Come on.
(Raymond grunting)

06:15.140 --> 06:16.960
Pow. Pow.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.090
(grunts)

06:18.290 --> 06:19.960
That's enough,
that's...

06:20.160 --> 06:21.830
The major I remember never quit.

06:22.030 --> 06:24.830
The major you remember had
his own hips. (chuckles)

06:25.030 --> 06:26.670
Besides, I've
been to the gym

06:26.870 --> 06:28.470
twice already with
Arkady this week.

06:28.670 --> 06:30.000
Seen inside Arkady's gym bag.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.640
Cigarettes and a flask
aren't exactly

06:31.840 --> 06:33.140
the building blocks
of a tough workout.

06:33.340 --> 06:34.440
Come on, let's go.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.140
You do know that elder abuse
is a crime.

06:37.340 --> 06:38.640
And what would you call
those drills

06:38.840 --> 06:39.950
you put me through
when I was a kid?

06:40.150 --> 06:41.510
Character building.
(chuckles)

06:41.710 --> 06:42.720
Child protective services

06:42.920 --> 06:44.220
would describe it differently.
Come on.

06:44.420 --> 06:45.750
Do you think you really
could've gotten through

06:45.950 --> 06:48.220
BUD/S training
otherwise?

06:48.420 --> 06:49.290
Probably.

06:49.490 --> 06:50.720
You got a healthy
imagination.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.060
(laughs)
You know what?

06:52.260 --> 06:53.690
You're right. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to push.

06:53.890 --> 06:55.290
You're getting too old
for this. Let's go.

06:55.490 --> 06:56.530
Here, catch.

06:56.730 --> 06:58.400
Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
(laughs)

06:58.600 --> 07:00.030
Okay, okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:00.230 --> 07:01.870
(laughs)
R-Really? Really?

07:02.070 --> 07:04.240
Hanna's rules 113.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.600
There is no rule 113.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.970
There is now.

07:07.170 --> 07:09.240
If you lip off to your old pop,

07:09.440 --> 07:10.940
he's gonna bust you
in your head.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.550
I don't want no problems, Pop.
Don't pop me.

07:12.750 --> 07:14.010
You want-want some of me?
I don't, I don't want none.

07:14.210 --> 07:15.110
Huh?
Pop, I don't want...

07:15.310 --> 07:16.350
Pop, I don't want
any problems.

07:16.550 --> 07:17.580
Huh? Huh?

07:17.780 --> 07:19.020
Sting Ray don't play.
(laughs) Okay.

07:19.220 --> 07:20.790
I don't want none
of the Sting Ray, Dad.

07:20.990 --> 07:22.020
Done with this?
You're done with this?

07:22.220 --> 07:23.860
(chuckles) You were
the one that said,

07:24.060 --> 07:25.620
"It's not camping
without s'mores."

07:25.820 --> 07:27.160
And that's a fact.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.960
DEEKS: Yeah, but you forgot
the marshmallows. So, s'mores

07:29.160 --> 07:32.200
without marshmallows
is just... "sores."

07:32.400 --> 07:33.800
What?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.900
Really? That's a,
that's a dad joke?

07:36.100 --> 07:37.100
You told me to call you out.

07:37.300 --> 07:38.400
Yeah, no, that's
what love looks like.

07:38.600 --> 07:39.870
Touché.
Wow. Okay, well, anyway,

07:40.070 --> 07:41.240
I brought the graham crackers

07:41.440 --> 07:43.140
and the chocolate.
Somebody dropped the ball

07:43.340 --> 07:44.810
on the marshmallows.
(whispers): Him.

07:45.010 --> 07:46.110
Well, I agree with Kensi,

07:46.310 --> 07:48.050
it's not camping
without s'mores, so

07:48.250 --> 07:49.820
we're gonna need to go
camping again.
DEEKS: Fine!

07:50.020 --> 07:51.850
We'll go again. I love that.
We should do it soon.
Deal.

07:52.050 --> 07:53.490
Well, I got
to go right now

07:53.690 --> 07:55.490
if I don't want to miss
the first bell.
DEEKS: Okay.

07:55.690 --> 07:57.060
Hey, wait, wait,
wait. Here.

07:57.260 --> 07:58.290
Okay. I love you.
Have fun.

07:58.490 --> 07:59.690
Bye.
KENSI:
Love you. Bye.

07:59.890 --> 08:00.790
DEEKS: All right,
today is a good day

08:00.990 --> 08:03.160
for a great day.
(laughs)

08:03.360 --> 08:06.200
Have fun storming ze castle!
ROSA: Will do.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.530
(laughs)

08:07.730 --> 08:09.330
I'm happy, too.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.540
Yeah, but happy
and fulfilled and grateful.

08:11.740 --> 08:13.740
I just want to remember
this moment in time.

08:13.940 --> 08:15.270
Okay, well, don't
let Kilbride hear you.

08:15.470 --> 08:17.110
You know how he feels
about mindfulness practice.

08:17.310 --> 08:18.840
You sound like
you're feeling better.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.110
Do you want me to make you
some breakfast?

08:21.310 --> 08:22.380
Ugh, no.

08:22.580 --> 08:24.380
Not until your shawarma
exits my body,

08:24.580 --> 08:26.120
which should be any day now.

08:26.320 --> 08:27.650
Okay, you asked me
if my leftovers

08:27.850 --> 08:29.190
in the fridge were still good.

08:29.390 --> 08:30.890
I thought you meant the ribs.
You didn't specify.

08:31.090 --> 08:34.030
Who leaves leftovers
in the fridge for a week?

08:34.230 --> 08:35.560
I forgot.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.330
You know who didn't forget? Me.

08:37.530 --> 08:38.830
You know what?
I'm gonna leave a Sharpie

08:39.030 --> 08:40.570
attached to the fridge,
and from now on,

08:40.770 --> 08:42.000
everything gets dated,

08:42.200 --> 08:44.140
and if it's more than
48 hours old, tossed.

08:44.340 --> 08:47.540
48 hours? Think about pizza.
That stays good for, like,

08:47.740 --> 08:48.710
a week... Okay.

08:48.910 --> 08:50.210
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?

08:50.410 --> 08:51.210
Yeah.
You know what the doctor
said I could eat?

08:51.410 --> 08:52.280
What'd they say?

08:52.480 --> 08:53.710
Rice, bananas...
Rice. Mm-hmm.

08:53.910 --> 08:55.350
...toast
and applesauce.

08:55.550 --> 08:57.220
That's not so bad. I can
make you a toasted banana,

08:57.420 --> 08:59.750
rice, applesauce
sandwich.

08:59.950 --> 09:02.050
To go. Would you
like that to go?

09:02.250 --> 09:03.960
You're a cruel man,
you know that?

09:04.160 --> 09:06.630
Think you're funny? (scoffs)
You're not funny.

09:06.830 --> 09:09.080
I love you.

09:10.710 --> 09:12.800
Babe? Okay.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.270
Stay focused.
Stay present.

09:15.470 --> 09:17.340
Maintain good eye contact
and good posture.
I will.

09:17.540 --> 09:18.770
I-I always do.

09:18.970 --> 09:20.740
And don't be afraid to
mirror who's ever talking,

09:20.940 --> 09:21.910
okay?
And don't fidget.

09:22.110 --> 09:23.310
Have you ever seen me fidget?

09:23.510 --> 09:25.180
Not with me,
but if you're nervous...

09:25.380 --> 09:26.910
I'm not nervous,
but you're getting me there.

09:27.110 --> 09:28.650
All right, I'm sorry.

09:28.850 --> 09:31.880
It's just, I know how important
personal presentation can be.

09:32.080 --> 09:33.450
It can sway the jury
in your favor.

09:33.650 --> 09:36.840
This is an interview,
not a trial.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.490
I know this means a lot to you.

09:39.690 --> 09:41.360
It means a lot to me, too.

09:41.560 --> 09:43.000
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.730
That's not true.
Yes, it is, and we both know it.

09:45.930 --> 09:47.100
Jordyn, you did this.

09:47.300 --> 09:49.130
It was a Rountree team effort.

09:49.330 --> 09:50.700
Just like everything else we do.

09:50.900 --> 09:52.870
All right, I can buy that.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.210
But it's not
the only medical school,

09:55.410 --> 09:57.540
so if they don't accept...
No, no.

09:57.740 --> 09:58.780
They will.

09:58.980 --> 10:01.410
I-I hope so,
but if they don't...

10:01.610 --> 10:03.550
Why are you psyching
yourself out?

10:03.750 --> 10:06.220
I'm not psyching myself out,
I'm just trying to prepare you,

10:06.420 --> 10:08.820
so that, if I don't get in,
you don't take it as your fault.

10:09.020 --> 10:10.440
I won't.

10:11.770 --> 10:12.730
I won't.

10:12.930 --> 10:14.160
Say it.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.060
Say, "I promise
I won't mope around for days

10:16.260 --> 10:17.300
if you don't get in."

10:17.500 --> 10:19.700
I promise.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.300
I'm just...

10:21.500 --> 10:23.870
I'm just so proud of you,
all right? Go give 'em hell.

10:24.070 --> 10:25.550
You know it.
(laughs)

10:28.520 --> 10:29.890
(sighs)

10:30.760 --> 10:32.460
You got this.

10:38.070 --> 10:39.570
(sighs)

10:50.010 --> 10:52.050
* *

11:13.600 --> 11:15.450
Admiral Kilbride, Kerry Adams,

11:15.650 --> 11:17.090
ATF SAC,
Los Angeles Field Office.

11:17.290 --> 11:19.090
Nice to meet you, Agent Adams.

11:19.290 --> 11:20.590
How may I be of service?

11:20.790 --> 11:23.100
Straight to business.
I like that.
(chuckles)

11:23.300 --> 11:26.630
I doubt that either of us
has time for much else.

11:26.830 --> 11:28.530
Ain't that the truth?

11:28.730 --> 11:30.600
So, we have an agent

11:30.800 --> 11:33.140
who has been under deep cover
for several months now

11:33.340 --> 11:34.610
working a weapons case.

11:34.810 --> 11:37.110
His name is William Newsome.

11:37.310 --> 11:40.380
He's had just
an exceptional career with us.

11:40.580 --> 11:41.910
He is truly one of our best.

11:42.110 --> 11:44.120
Do you think
he might be in trouble?

11:44.320 --> 11:46.450
Almost always, but usually
for all the right reasons.

11:46.650 --> 11:47.820
(chuckles)

11:48.020 --> 11:50.160
These military-grade
weapons and ordnance

11:50.360 --> 11:52.090
are not from shipments
from manufacturers.

11:52.290 --> 11:55.590
They are stolen, but we're
not entirely certain from where,

11:55.790 --> 11:57.960
so I would like your assistance

11:58.160 --> 12:00.200
regarding DoD weapons
and ordnance holdings.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.370
What's your man saying?

12:02.570 --> 12:04.800
He's not.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.770
He has missed three
of his scheduled check-ins,

12:07.970 --> 12:09.310
but he always comes back online,

12:09.510 --> 12:11.180
and he always has a...

12:11.380 --> 12:13.010
seemingly legitimate excuse.

12:13.210 --> 12:17.120
And you think maybe
he has lost his way?

12:17.320 --> 12:19.450
There have been rumors,

12:19.650 --> 12:22.120
which I normally
wouldn't listen to,

12:22.320 --> 12:23.720
but Newsome,

12:23.920 --> 12:26.560
he's the kind of guy who
dedicated his life to this job,

12:26.760 --> 12:28.460
maybe a little too much so.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.460
He lost a daughter a couple
years back to a drug overdose

12:31.660 --> 12:33.070
and then he got a divorce.

12:33.270 --> 12:34.370
(sighs)

12:34.570 --> 12:36.500
Not an unfamiliar story.
I know,

12:36.700 --> 12:38.370
but that combined
with his recent

12:38.570 --> 12:40.140
change in behavior,

12:40.340 --> 12:41.790
it has me worried.

12:42.790 --> 12:43.780
Admiral,
he has intimate

12:43.980 --> 12:45.480
knowledge of our operations

12:45.680 --> 12:48.660
and probably some fellow agents
who are still loyal to him.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.650
What in particular
would you like us to do?

12:52.850 --> 12:54.590
I would like for your people

12:54.790 --> 12:56.790
to see what they can learn,

12:56.990 --> 12:58.460
and I hope I'm wrong.

12:58.660 --> 13:00.230
I do, but if I'm not,

13:00.430 --> 13:03.230
Newsome is a battle-tested,
high-functioning operative,

13:03.430 --> 13:07.000
which is to say he is not
somebody you want to cross,

13:07.200 --> 13:09.470
even for your people.

13:09.670 --> 13:11.070
We'll see what we can find out.

13:11.270 --> 13:13.890
If he's in trouble,
we'll help him.

13:14.690 --> 13:17.040
If he's dirty...

13:17.240 --> 13:18.740
well...

13:18.940 --> 13:21.280
let's cross that bridge
when we come to it.

13:21.480 --> 13:22.380
Thank you.

13:22.580 --> 13:24.300
Yes, ma'am.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.550
<i>(phone buzzes)</i>

13:28.750 --> 13:31.190
It's Ops.
They sent this to the team.

13:31.390 --> 13:34.090
ATF doesn't have any evidence,
but the SAC

13:34.290 --> 13:37.030
thinks that this Agent Newsome
may have gone rogue.

13:37.230 --> 13:39.000
So what's the play?
(chuckles)

13:39.200 --> 13:41.070
Kilbride wants us
to keep an open mind,

13:41.270 --> 13:43.370
but stay on high alert with him.
Oh, great.

13:43.570 --> 13:44.870
So, work with the guy,

13:45.070 --> 13:46.500
but don't let him shoot you
in the back of the head.

13:46.700 --> 13:47.710
Yeah,
something like that.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.440
That's not
an ideal situation.

13:49.640 --> 13:50.640
Not at all.

13:50.840 --> 13:51.940
But if we're lucky,

13:52.140 --> 13:53.750
he doesn't know that
his boss has suspicions.

13:53.950 --> 13:55.280
It'll at least give us
a slight advantage.

13:55.480 --> 13:58.320
And if he does,
it gives us a disadvantage.

13:58.520 --> 13:59.680
Mm, well, hopefully,

13:59.880 --> 14:01.670
we'll be able to read him
when we meet him.

14:02.640 --> 14:03.990
Guy's been undercover this long,

14:04.190 --> 14:06.160
he knows how to project
what he wants people to believe.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.390
Everyone has a tell.

14:08.590 --> 14:09.530
I don't.

14:09.730 --> 14:11.280
Of course you do.

14:12.150 --> 14:13.230
Yeah? What's my tell?

14:13.430 --> 14:14.770
That was it right there.

14:14.970 --> 14:16.840
I didn't do anything.
You did this.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.340
(laughs)

14:18.540 --> 14:19.670
I just moved my head.

14:19.870 --> 14:21.170
You tilted your head.

14:21.370 --> 14:23.380
No. That's a look,
not a tell.

14:23.580 --> 14:25.180
Well, you could've looked at me
without tilting your head.

14:25.380 --> 14:26.680
You need to give
your head a shake

14:26.880 --> 14:28.080
because you're the one
with the tell.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.480
(giggles) Yeah, what's that?
You just did it.

14:30.680 --> 14:32.020
Yeah, right.

14:32.220 --> 14:33.950
See? You've been doing it
so long, you didn't even notice.

14:34.150 --> 14:36.590
I asked you a question.
I didn't move my head.

14:36.790 --> 14:38.360
You giggled.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.830
(giggles)
All right?
And that's your tell.

14:41.030 --> 14:42.460
Get out of here.
I'm not a giggler.

14:42.660 --> 14:43.660
Of course. Okay.

14:43.860 --> 14:45.300
You're definitely
a giggler.

14:45.500 --> 14:48.470
I may have chuckled at the
absurdity of your suggestion,

14:48.670 --> 14:50.020
but that is not a tell.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.510
Whatever you say,
Giggles.

14:53.710 --> 14:55.790
Tilty.
(imitates giggle)

14:58.630 --> 15:00.680
Special Agent
Callen and Hanna.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.650
This is Special Agent ATF
Bill Newsome.

15:02.850 --> 15:04.950
CALLEN:
Our ops center received
the ATF report,

15:05.150 --> 15:06.220
but who
are these guys?

15:06.420 --> 15:08.650
Trigger-happy gunrunners
with a drug issue.

15:08.850 --> 15:10.060
That's a good
combination.

15:10.260 --> 15:11.820
NEWSOME:
Yeah, tell me about it.

15:12.020 --> 15:13.390
I was brought in 'cause nobody
can seem to figure out

15:13.590 --> 15:15.660
who's running this organization
or where they're getting

15:15.860 --> 15:17.760
their military-grade
weapons inventory.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.160
Well,
Admiral Kilbride

15:19.360 --> 15:20.730
says we're gonna be
working this together.

15:20.930 --> 15:22.000
We need to work fast.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.640
These guys are
about to leave L.A.,

15:23.840 --> 15:25.200
and they have
a big stockpile of weapons

15:25.400 --> 15:26.570
somewhere here
in town.

15:26.770 --> 15:27.710
They've moved it.

15:27.910 --> 15:29.510
I cannot locate it
or their buyers.

15:29.710 --> 15:31.880
They want to offload
the weapons and then disappear.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.110
Yes. That's why I need
to get back there ASAP.

15:34.310 --> 15:36.380
Okay. We'll have
two of our agents

15:36.580 --> 15:38.050
provide overwatch for you.

15:38.250 --> 15:40.490
Me and Callen will figure out
who's running this operation

15:40.690 --> 15:41.750
and which U.S. military base

15:41.950 --> 15:43.090
the weapons
are being stolen from.

15:43.290 --> 15:44.260
Copy that.

15:44.460 --> 15:45.590
FATIMA:
Hey.

15:45.790 --> 15:47.160
ATF sent over
Newsome's reports.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.430
I've been going
through them.

15:48.630 --> 15:50.480
All right, cool.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.280
Okay, what's up with you?

15:54.520 --> 15:57.240
Uh, nothing.
Let's just get to work.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.870
Okay.

15:59.070 --> 16:01.610
Well, I think
we should start with...
You know what?

16:01.810 --> 16:02.870
I'm sorry.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.610
I just got a text
from my lawyer.

16:04.810 --> 16:07.880
There's been some movement in
my civil case against the LAPD.

16:08.080 --> 16:09.880
He said he'd call me back
when he figures it out,

16:10.080 --> 16:11.020
whatever that means.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.550
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.290
Yeah.

16:15.490 --> 16:18.520
It's just that Jordyn doesn't
need any extra drama this week.

16:18.720 --> 16:20.230
I know.

16:20.430 --> 16:23.560
Anyways, we don't have anything
on this arms-dealing group?

16:23.760 --> 16:25.730
Well, not nothing.

16:25.930 --> 16:27.230
So, Agent Newsome's
been cataloging

16:27.430 --> 16:29.170
some of the weapons
that they're selling.

16:29.370 --> 16:30.770
Mm.

16:30.970 --> 16:32.240
High-grade
military weapons, huh?

16:32.440 --> 16:33.610
Mm-hmm.

16:33.810 --> 16:35.010
You thinking what
I'm thinking?

16:35.210 --> 16:36.570
Track down
Nina Barnes?

16:36.770 --> 16:38.160
Oh, yeah.

16:40.660 --> 16:43.620
Ah, Agent Blye,
Investigator Deeks,

16:43.820 --> 16:45.720
this is ATF
Agent Newsome.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.050
Pleasure
to meet you, sir.

16:47.250 --> 16:48.550
I hear we'll be
your overwatch.

16:48.750 --> 16:51.120
Yeah. I've got no idea
if my cover's been blown.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.390
Well, if it has,
we've got your six.

16:53.590 --> 16:55.330
Appreciate that.

16:55.530 --> 16:56.930
Now, the, uh, house

16:57.130 --> 16:59.260
is secured and isolated
here in Malibu Canyon.

16:59.460 --> 17:01.670
You ought to be able
to find some cover

17:01.870 --> 17:03.740
and high ground
either here or here.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.000
Yeah, I know that area well.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.890
Should we grab supplies?

17:08.060 --> 17:10.710
KILBRIDE:
Now, we don't have much
background except that there are

17:10.910 --> 17:12.640
ten bodies
tied to 'em.

17:12.840 --> 17:13.980
This guy's got
ten bodies on him?

17:14.180 --> 17:16.850
So, no cowboy stuff,
Agent Newsome.

17:17.050 --> 17:19.120
If you have any notion

17:19.320 --> 17:21.620
that your cover
has been compromised,

17:21.820 --> 17:22.950
you signal Kensi

17:23.160 --> 17:24.490
and Deeks, and then
you hit the deck.

17:24.690 --> 17:27.690
I do not need a dead
ATF agent on my watch.

17:27.890 --> 17:30.040
Copy that, Admiral.
KENSI: Shall we?

17:35.320 --> 17:36.880
(sighs)

17:48.630 --> 17:50.010
CALLEN:
Is this really necessary?

17:50.220 --> 17:52.120
I mean, couldn't we
have met her at her store

17:52.320 --> 17:53.550
or at her roach coach?

17:53.750 --> 17:56.650
(chuckles) If you refer
to her gourmet pastry truck

17:56.850 --> 17:59.090
as a "roach coach,"
she's not gonna help us.

17:59.290 --> 18:02.330
Yeah, she's meeting
an angel investor down there.

18:02.530 --> 18:05.100
Her canelés are
about to go big-time.

18:05.300 --> 18:06.860
Good for Nina.

18:07.060 --> 18:08.730
All right, let's see
what kind of security systems

18:08.930 --> 18:10.440
you can tap into
around us.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.670
Keep an eye on us,
just in case.

18:12.870 --> 18:14.540
Yeah, of course. Will do.

18:14.740 --> 18:16.310
So, I was go...
So, now...

18:16.510 --> 18:17.780
Go ahead.

18:17.980 --> 18:19.780
(stammers)
No, no, you, please.

18:19.980 --> 18:21.180
Please.

18:21.380 --> 18:22.650
Honestly, what I was gonna say
will not be as important

18:22.850 --> 18:24.830
as what you were gonna say.
So, please.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.090
You know I hate
when you do that, right?

18:29.290 --> 18:31.460
When I try to be polite?

18:31.660 --> 18:33.880
It's a classic Callen
stalling tactic.

18:35.310 --> 18:36.640
(scoffs)

18:39.610 --> 18:41.480
You think I'm doing
the right thing?

18:42.720 --> 18:44.640
Doesn't matter what I think,

18:44.840 --> 18:47.820
or anyone else,
for that matter.

18:49.220 --> 18:52.430
But, yes, I think you're
doing the right thing.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.250
What?

18:56.450 --> 18:57.280
Nothing.

18:57.480 --> 18:58.880
Come on, tell me.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.250
Uh... (sighs)

19:00.450 --> 19:02.290
It's just, it's just hard
to believe, you know?

19:02.490 --> 19:04.490
G. Callen,

19:04.690 --> 19:05.960
the nomad,

19:06.160 --> 19:07.430
the lone wolf,

19:07.630 --> 19:09.290
the shadow,

19:09.490 --> 19:11.210
about to be
a married man.

19:12.380 --> 19:14.200
Yup. (sighs)

19:14.400 --> 19:15.470
(chuckles)

19:15.670 --> 19:17.030
Did you plan
your wedding?

19:17.240 --> 19:18.740
Are you kidding me?

19:18.940 --> 19:21.990
You knew Michelle.
I was lucky she let me attend.

19:23.330 --> 19:26.130
That woman was nothing
if not a taskmaster.

19:28.930 --> 19:30.730
Wow.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.740
Long time ago.

19:38.540 --> 19:40.980
(phone buzzes)

19:43.510 --> 19:44.930
Oh.

19:45.130 --> 19:46.560
Everything good?

19:46.760 --> 19:49.030
Yeah, looks good.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.170
Remember that clinical trial
I was telling you about

19:51.370 --> 19:54.010
that was showing promise,
might be able to help my dad?

19:54.210 --> 19:55.410
Yeah, something popped?

19:55.610 --> 19:57.510
No, not yet, but they asking
for more information.

19:57.710 --> 19:59.910
They said my dad could
be a good candidate.

20:00.110 --> 20:01.110
That would be great.

20:01.310 --> 20:02.930
Be really great.

20:05.130 --> 20:06.270
Hmm.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.520
ROUNTREE:
<i>Yo, Fatima.</i>

20:08.720 --> 20:10.540
Come check this out.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.300
So, I've been looking
into Newsome's finances.

20:17.500 --> 20:18.800
There's nothing
out of the ordinary.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.230
I mean,
his paychecks come in,

20:20.430 --> 20:22.230
and the money goes out
as soon as he pays his bills.

20:22.430 --> 20:23.800
Mm, I can relate.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.070
But get this, his daughter
is enrolled at Pepperdine,

20:26.270 --> 20:28.210
and there's
no financial aid listed,

20:28.410 --> 20:30.940
and she drives
a late model Range Rover.

20:31.140 --> 20:33.880
Newsome's salary
couldn't cover that.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.550
Nope, and I haven't found
any income listed

20:36.750 --> 20:40.200
for his ex-wife or his daughter
over the past year.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.270
So you think
he really is dirty?

20:44.240 --> 20:47.830
I don't know, but if he is
working with these gunrunners,

20:48.030 --> 20:49.890
he's gonna do everything
in his power to protect them

20:50.090 --> 20:51.780
from our team
at all cost.

20:53.720 --> 20:54.830
CALLEN:
<i>You got your speech written?</i>

20:55.030 --> 20:57.030
It's a work
in progress.

20:57.230 --> 20:58.340
Uh-huh.

20:58.540 --> 21:00.840
Just don't embarrass me
or yourself.
Oh.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.710
And don't tell
the Damascus story.

21:02.910 --> 21:04.580
Damascus story
is funny.

21:04.780 --> 21:06.640
Not in mixed company,
it's not.

21:06.840 --> 21:07.810
Speaking of which...

21:08.010 --> 21:10.280
(sighs) What's up, Sam?

21:10.480 --> 21:11.420
Sup?

21:11.620 --> 21:12.850
Other guy.

21:13.050 --> 21:14.970
Couldn't have done this
over the phone, huh?

21:15.770 --> 21:17.560
I thought you were
in intelligence.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.790
He's been under
a little stress.

21:19.990 --> 21:22.590
Oh, right, the wedding.

21:22.790 --> 21:23.900
Good luck with that.

21:24.100 --> 21:25.630
You know, I was
married four times,

21:25.830 --> 21:28.300
twice to the same guy. You know
what I learned with each one?

21:28.500 --> 21:29.670
That you're a joy
to live with?

21:29.870 --> 21:32.000
Don't do it.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.610
But then, of course,
I kept getting married, so

21:34.810 --> 21:36.570
I'm a devil for punishment.
(laughs)

21:36.770 --> 21:38.210
You got something for us?

21:38.410 --> 21:39.880
Yeah, your minions filled me in.

21:40.080 --> 21:43.110
This, uh, this group that your
ATF dude is undercover with,

21:43.310 --> 21:46.050
from what I've heard,
these guys are psychopaths.

21:46.250 --> 21:48.520
Make the Wagner fellas
look like Boy Scouts.

21:48.720 --> 21:49.990
You got a name for the leader?

21:50.190 --> 21:51.420
Not yet.

21:51.620 --> 21:53.760
They're, uh, very insular
and run low to the ground.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.330
These guys are like ghosts.

21:55.530 --> 21:57.630
Anybody who gets too close
to 'em usually disappears.

21:57.830 --> 21:59.330
The old <i>Nacht und Nebel.</i>

21:59.530 --> 22:01.730
Nobody wants to talk about 'em
for fear of being disappeared.

22:01.930 --> 22:04.070
And you couldn't have
told us that on the phone?

22:04.270 --> 22:05.570
Maybe.

22:05.770 --> 22:08.120
But then I wouldn't
get to see Sam.

22:09.290 --> 22:11.280
(Nina laughs)
But you've got nothing for us?

22:11.480 --> 22:14.210
No, not nothing.
Look, the chatter on the wires

22:14.410 --> 22:17.750
is that these guys float above
the law because of primo intel.

22:17.950 --> 22:19.650
Are they working with someone
in law enforcement?

22:19.850 --> 22:21.890
Unclear so far,
but I've got some... (sighs)

22:22.090 --> 22:23.660
soft, uh, inquiries out there,

22:23.860 --> 22:26.420
but I'll have something for you
by the time your order's ready.

22:26.620 --> 22:27.660
What order?

22:27.860 --> 22:30.530
The $200 worth
of assorted pastry

22:30.730 --> 22:32.160
that you're getting.

22:32.360 --> 22:35.530
And what are we gonna do with
$200 of assorted pastries?

22:35.730 --> 22:38.300
Eat it, give it away,
have a bake sale.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.740
I don't care, but this...

22:40.940 --> 22:42.710
this does not come
for free anymore.

22:42.910 --> 22:45.110
You gonna slide in
some of that red velvet?

22:45.310 --> 22:47.780
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You know what else?
Hmm?

22:47.980 --> 22:51.150
I got some ladyfingers
for you.
Nice.

22:51.350 --> 22:52.550
(laughs)

22:52.750 --> 22:53.550
CALLEN:
Okay.

22:53.750 --> 22:55.190
(laughter)

22:55.390 --> 22:56.450
(typing)

22:56.650 --> 22:57.790
CALLEN: Fatima,
we're gonna need to speak

22:57.990 --> 22:59.890
to a naval ordnance specialist.

23:00.090 --> 23:01.080
Will do.

23:02.940 --> 23:05.230
You think it's odd that
Newsome hasn't asked why

23:05.430 --> 23:07.200
we're backing him up
instead of his own agency?

23:07.400 --> 23:09.370
Maybe he had that conversation
with Kilbride.

23:09.570 --> 23:11.800
Hey, is it something specific
you're looking for?

23:12.000 --> 23:13.970
No, but as Nina
tries to figure out

23:14.170 --> 23:15.240
who's running this operation,

23:15.440 --> 23:17.070
we'll come at it
from the weapons side.

23:17.270 --> 23:18.890
Copy that.

23:20.330 --> 23:24.180
Next time we are doing this
over the phone. (scoffs)

23:24.380 --> 23:26.180
Ladyfingers.

23:26.380 --> 23:27.490
Please.

23:27.690 --> 23:30.960
Whatever you say, cupcake.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.310
(laughs)

23:42.620 --> 23:44.570
DEEKS:
<i>Is it almost rattlesnake season?</i>

23:44.770 --> 23:46.140
Isn't it always
rattlesnake season?

23:46.340 --> 23:48.270
DEEKS: No, not in the winter.
They're cold-blooded reptiles.

23:48.470 --> 23:49.940
Remember, that's how
I saved Darrel Dinkins

23:50.140 --> 23:51.940
from that boa constrictor
on his neck. Remember that?

23:52.140 --> 23:53.510
Oh, yes.
Put ice packs on there?

23:53.710 --> 23:54.880
I tell you that story?
You did.

23:55.080 --> 23:56.510
Like 10,000 times.

23:56.710 --> 23:58.250
Yeah. It was a big deal at
the time. Even made the, uh...

23:58.450 --> 23:59.750
Newspapers, yeah. I know.

23:59.950 --> 24:01.290
Mama Deeks also showed me
those clippings

24:01.490 --> 24:02.590
about 10,000 times.

24:02.790 --> 24:04.020
Yeah, but does Rosa know?
Does our daughter

24:04.220 --> 24:05.860
know the story of my, uh...
(groans)

24:06.060 --> 24:07.530
reptilian heroism?

24:07.730 --> 24:09.030
I really feel like our daughter
doesn't need to know that.

24:09.230 --> 24:10.630
You know, give her a chance
at a better future.

24:10.830 --> 24:12.560
Wow, you are just
mean-spirted today.

24:12.760 --> 24:13.870
(radio chirps)
Go for Kensi.

24:14.070 --> 24:15.470
KILBRIDE:
Looking for a sitrep, agents.

24:15.670 --> 24:18.770
Uh, we will be in position
in about 12 minutes.

24:18.970 --> 24:20.540
Anything new
to report on Newsome?

24:20.740 --> 24:24.510
Well, Fatima and Rountree
found some questionable items

24:24.710 --> 24:27.210
in his financials, they're
digging deeper into that.

24:27.410 --> 24:29.380
DEEKS: I got to be honest,
he is pretty chill for a guy

24:29.580 --> 24:31.320
in his situation.

24:31.520 --> 24:35.320
So, either he is
a real cool customer

24:35.520 --> 24:36.790
or he knows something we don't.

24:36.990 --> 24:38.720
Like maybe these mercs
we keep hearing about

24:38.920 --> 24:40.760
aren't actually a danger to him
because he's in bed with them?

24:40.960 --> 24:43.460
Yeah, but then why would
he agree to meet with us?

24:43.660 --> 24:44.900
Maybe to find out what we know.

24:45.100 --> 24:46.160
Yeah, but that still
doesn't explain

24:46.360 --> 24:47.770
why he'd want us on overwatch.

24:47.970 --> 24:50.330
Unless he plans
to use you as an alibi.

24:50.530 --> 24:51.670
You think this whole thing
is for show?

24:51.870 --> 24:52.700
Could be.

24:52.900 --> 24:54.140
Or a trap.

24:54.340 --> 24:57.740
I have sent Sam and Callen
to speak with his SAC.

24:57.940 --> 24:59.510
Keep your wits about
you out there.

24:59.710 --> 25:01.560
Yeah, will do.
(beeps)

25:03.770 --> 25:04.950
You thinking what I'm thinking?

25:05.150 --> 25:07.220
That Thin Mints are
the devil's candy?

25:07.420 --> 25:09.020
What?

25:09.220 --> 25:10.920
That we should find
a new overwatch position

25:11.120 --> 25:14.360
because Newsome's
probably setting us up?

25:14.560 --> 25:15.530
I know what you're
thinking now, too.

25:15.730 --> 25:16.990
You're thinking, "God,

25:17.190 --> 25:19.100
"I just feel so lucky that
he's not only my partner

25:19.300 --> 25:20.750
but he's my husband."

25:21.680 --> 25:24.740
Yep. Lucky, lucky me.

25:24.940 --> 25:27.620
Just #Blessed.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.580
* Pushin' rope *

25:31.780 --> 25:35.760
* Into sand *

25:37.060 --> 25:41.590
* Soon is the death of man... *

25:41.790 --> 25:43.120
(floorboard creaks)

25:43.320 --> 25:44.620
(knife scrapes)

25:44.820 --> 25:47.860
Annie, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! I come in peace!

25:48.060 --> 25:50.030
What are you doing,
sneaking up on me?

25:50.230 --> 25:52.400
Who's sneaking? I knocked.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.030
You with those stupid ear bugs.

25:54.230 --> 25:56.330
But I was about to stab
your eyes out.

25:56.530 --> 25:58.170
You called me.

25:58.370 --> 26:01.010
(sighs) Right. Right, I'm sorry.

26:01.210 --> 26:03.110
I'm sorry and thank you.

26:03.310 --> 26:04.840
Thank you so much for coming.

26:05.040 --> 26:08.080
All this wedding planning, it's
worse than a suicide mission.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.850
Oh, tell me about it.

26:10.050 --> 26:11.650
Sometimes I think
the only purpose

26:11.850 --> 26:14.420
of getting married is
to prepare you for death.

26:14.620 --> 26:15.920
What?

26:16.120 --> 26:17.560
Nothing.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.790
No. (chuckles) I was kidding.

26:19.990 --> 26:21.590
(sighs weakly)

26:21.790 --> 26:24.480
So, where do we start?

26:25.450 --> 26:28.000
Uh, well, that's the thing, I...

26:28.200 --> 26:30.100
I don't even know.

26:30.300 --> 26:31.170
We lost our band.

26:31.370 --> 26:32.740
That sucks.

26:32.940 --> 26:33.710
Yeah.

26:33.910 --> 26:35.170
But not insurmountable.

26:35.370 --> 26:40.040
I know plenty of musicians.
What about Ivanov?

26:40.240 --> 26:41.350
No.

26:41.550 --> 26:42.680
Smirnov.

26:42.880 --> 26:43.980
No.

26:44.180 --> 26:45.050
Sokolov?

26:45.250 --> 26:46.820
No. No "ovs."

26:47.020 --> 26:49.290
Okay? This is a wedding,
it's not a Maslenitsa.

26:49.490 --> 26:51.220
Everyone dances at Maslenitsa.

26:51.420 --> 26:52.760
It's a pancake festival.

26:52.960 --> 26:55.090
Who doesn't like pancakes?

26:55.290 --> 26:56.790
Okay, you know what?

26:56.990 --> 26:58.460
This clearly was a bad idea.

26:58.660 --> 26:59.700
Of course it is bad idea,

26:59.900 --> 27:02.470
that's what
I have been telling you.

27:02.670 --> 27:04.870
You want me to call Grisha?

27:05.070 --> 27:06.270
What? No.

27:06.470 --> 27:08.470
Not the wedding, you idiot.

27:08.670 --> 27:09.810
Calling you for help.

27:10.010 --> 27:13.460
(chuckles) I knew that.
I was kidding.

27:14.660 --> 27:17.280
What about Titan?
He's very popular.

27:17.480 --> 27:18.820
Everybody can dance.

27:19.020 --> 27:22.350
No, he is a Vegas DJ
who plays major clubs.

27:22.550 --> 27:23.920
He doesn't play weddings.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.290
He will for me.

27:25.490 --> 27:27.890
His real name is Dmitri Sokolov.

27:28.090 --> 27:30.330
I play Durak
with his father Aleksei.

27:30.530 --> 27:32.630
He owes me lots of favors.

27:32.830 --> 27:35.080
I mean, hundreds of favors.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.570
(line ringing)

27:37.770 --> 27:40.710
Aleksei. Arkady.

27:40.910 --> 27:42.410
Yeah.
(laughs)

27:42.610 --> 27:44.310
It's time to pay back favor.

27:44.510 --> 27:46.540
Yeah, I need your son
to deejay

27:46.740 --> 27:49.180
my only daughter Anna's wedding.

27:49.380 --> 27:50.280
(chuckles)

27:50.480 --> 27:51.780
(mutters)

27:51.980 --> 27:54.690
Um... don't worry
about the cost.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.620
The kids will work that out.

27:56.820 --> 27:58.660
Yeah, no, of course
you can come.

27:58.860 --> 28:00.880
How's new girlfriend?
She good?

28:01.680 --> 28:03.080
Thanks, Castor.

28:04.710 --> 28:06.730
If you two already have
some new information for me,

28:06.930 --> 28:09.070
I am going to be very impressed.

28:09.270 --> 28:10.940
We still have more
questions than answers.

28:11.140 --> 28:12.970
I'm afraid that
makes three of us.

28:13.170 --> 28:14.810
So, we reviewed Newsome's
files and casework.

28:15.010 --> 28:17.210
It... it all seems
very solid to us.

28:17.410 --> 28:19.980
Well, like I told Admiral
Kilbride, he is one of our best.

28:20.180 --> 28:22.450
We still have financial
points of interest, though,

28:22.650 --> 28:23.750
which we're still looking into.

28:23.950 --> 28:25.450
Really? Like what?

28:25.650 --> 28:27.050
Well, it's,
it's nothing concrete.

28:27.250 --> 28:28.650
There just seems to be some
extra cash floating around

28:28.850 --> 28:31.360
that we can't locate
the income source of.

28:31.560 --> 28:33.260
Wow.
But, that being said,

28:33.460 --> 28:36.130
we don't completely
understand what triggered

28:36.330 --> 28:38.030
your initial suspicions
of Newsome.

28:38.230 --> 28:40.430
Which is my partner's
polite way of saying

28:40.630 --> 28:41.730
we think you're
holding out on us.

28:41.930 --> 28:43.870
I'm sorry you feel that way.

28:44.070 --> 28:45.500
Well, then you can
make it up to us

28:45.700 --> 28:47.070
by giving us
everything you have.

28:47.270 --> 28:49.640
Which is my partner's
not so polite way of saying

28:49.840 --> 28:50.880
we understand that
you want to protect

28:51.080 --> 28:52.140
the reputation of the agency,

28:52.340 --> 28:54.110
but if there's any other
ATF personnel

28:54.310 --> 28:56.850
that may be helping Newsome,
you need to let us know.

28:57.050 --> 28:59.750
Okay, yes, my number one concern
is protecting my people

28:59.950 --> 29:02.850
and the agency,
but I assure you, if I knew

29:03.050 --> 29:05.390
of such individuals,
I would have told you.

29:05.590 --> 29:07.560
It's one of the main reasons
I reached out to the admiral.

29:07.760 --> 29:08.930
Look, I hate to say this,

29:09.130 --> 29:10.660
but these guys that
Newsome's tracking,

29:10.860 --> 29:12.730
they've somehow managed to stay
about three steps ahead of us.

29:12.930 --> 29:14.900
And if it's not Newsome,
I don't know who else it is.

29:15.100 --> 29:16.670
Well, it could be it's not ATF.

29:16.870 --> 29:18.240
Several of Newsome's
operations

29:18.440 --> 29:20.100
were joint ops with local
law enforcement, correct?

29:20.300 --> 29:21.970
Yes.
So it could be
a dirty cop,

29:22.170 --> 29:24.710
it could be someone
from another agency.
(phone buzzes)

29:24.910 --> 29:26.990
It's the major. Excuse me.

29:28.900 --> 29:31.070
Unrelated to this case.

29:32.070 --> 29:33.820
(sighs)

29:34.020 --> 29:35.150
Dad, we got to talk fast.

29:35.350 --> 29:36.990
I'm in the middle
of something important.

29:37.190 --> 29:39.290
RAYMOND: Well, good. I don't
feel like working out today.

29:39.490 --> 29:40.990
My shoulder's acting up.

29:41.190 --> 29:43.290
All right, that's fine.
We-We'll talk about it tonight.

29:43.490 --> 29:44.360
Okay.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.230
But I'm not working out today.

29:46.430 --> 29:47.770
I'm going to go home.

29:47.970 --> 29:49.670
Dad, where are you?

29:49.870 --> 29:51.270
Oh, I came to the park,

29:51.470 --> 29:54.740
but I'm not working out today.
My shoulder's too sore.

29:54.940 --> 29:57.170
Dad. We already worked out
this morning.

29:57.370 --> 29:58.880
You punched me
in the head, remember?

29:59.080 --> 30:00.610
What?

30:00.810 --> 30:02.110
How did you get to the park?

30:02.310 --> 30:04.880
I walked. And that's
enough exercise.

30:05.080 --> 30:07.380
Okay. Okay.
Okay, I'll tell you what.

30:07.580 --> 30:09.520
Why don't you just find a seat

30:09.720 --> 30:11.790
and I'm gonna come give you
a ride home, all right?

30:11.990 --> 30:15.490
I don't want a ride home.
I like walking.

30:15.690 --> 30:17.930
Dad, please stay put.

30:18.130 --> 30:21.220
I'll be there as soon
as I can, all right?

30:22.350 --> 30:23.270
Hello?

30:23.470 --> 30:25.500
(line beeps)

30:25.700 --> 30:27.650
(sighs)

30:29.960 --> 30:32.530
Find any needles
in that haystack?

30:33.430 --> 30:35.380
No, but I figured out
how Newsome's daughter

30:35.580 --> 30:36.750
is paying for college.

30:36.950 --> 30:38.520
Proceeds from stolen weapons?

30:38.720 --> 30:40.080
Her grandfather set up

30:40.280 --> 30:42.190
a college savings account
for her when she was born.

30:42.390 --> 30:45.990
Good for her, bad for us.
Puts us back at square one.

30:46.190 --> 30:48.830
Yeah. And Kilbride wants us
to look into everyone

30:49.030 --> 30:51.000
Agent Newsome has worked
with on this case.

30:51.200 --> 30:55.370
I mean, that's ATF,
L.A. Sheriff's, and LAPD.

30:55.570 --> 30:57.030
Yeah.

30:57.230 --> 31:00.350
Damn, haystack
just got bigger.

31:06.460 --> 31:07.710
Here we go.

31:07.910 --> 31:10.030
I got two large sprinter vans
approaching.

31:17.800 --> 31:19.060
Mm-hmm, just your
standard delivery

31:19.260 --> 31:20.720
from your friendly
neighborhood stolen guns

31:20.920 --> 31:21.760
and explosives store.

31:21.960 --> 31:25.850
That is a very big delivery.

31:37.990 --> 31:39.740
Sir, Commander Collins

31:39.940 --> 31:42.380
with Navy Munitions Command
Pac is online now.

31:42.580 --> 31:44.430
Got it. Put her through.

31:46.270 --> 31:48.650
Thank you for getting back to me
so quickly, Commander.

31:48.850 --> 31:51.290
Not a problem at all.
Good to meet you, Admiral.

31:51.490 --> 31:54.130
Uh, we have been investigating

31:54.330 --> 31:56.960
a potentially large-scale
weapons sale.

31:57.160 --> 31:58.260
Yes, sir.

31:58.460 --> 31:59.930
Your office briefed me.
Good, good.

32:00.130 --> 32:02.630
Now, we have been focused
on trying to figure out

32:02.830 --> 32:04.640
who's running this operation,
but I wanted to bring you

32:04.840 --> 32:07.170
on board to help us learn more

32:07.370 --> 32:09.240
about the weapons side
of the transactions.

32:09.440 --> 32:10.840
I hope I can be of assistance.

32:11.040 --> 32:12.580
I've looked over
this list of munitions

32:12.780 --> 32:14.150
that Agent Namazi sent over.

32:14.350 --> 32:17.450
All of which are stored
in your facilities, correct?

32:17.650 --> 32:19.220
Much of this, yes.

32:19.420 --> 32:22.020
Any idea how these may have
wound up on the black market?

32:22.220 --> 32:23.650
No, Admiral.

32:23.850 --> 32:26.090
But I can guarantee you they
didn't come from our stockpiles.

32:26.290 --> 32:28.130
And how can you be so sure?

32:28.330 --> 32:31.760
Because that's my job and I run
an extremely tight operation.

32:31.960 --> 32:33.930
If a pencil sharpener goes
missing, I know about it.

32:34.130 --> 32:38.700
Well, we're a little bit less
concerned with pencil sharpeners

32:38.900 --> 32:41.470
and a little bit more concerned
with anti-tank missiles

32:41.670 --> 32:43.470
and anti-personnel mines.

32:43.670 --> 32:44.840
Now, if these
weapons didn't come

32:45.040 --> 32:47.710
from your inventory,
where are they from?

32:47.910 --> 32:49.380
All due respect, sir, I believe

32:49.580 --> 32:51.880
that's your area of expertise,
not mine.

32:52.080 --> 32:54.920
We're not the only military
to employ some of these weapons.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.320
For instance, M240 machine guns.

32:57.520 --> 32:59.360
What other military uses them?

32:59.560 --> 33:00.960
Quite a few.

33:01.160 --> 33:02.860
I'll cross-reference
this entire inventory list

33:03.060 --> 33:05.100
with foreign militaries
and get back to you.

33:05.300 --> 33:07.050
Thank you, Commander.

33:10.950 --> 33:12.890
(phone chimes)

33:19.760 --> 33:20.710
RAYMOND:
<i>I like the sunshine.</i>

33:20.910 --> 33:22.250
It's-it's good for the joints,

33:22.450 --> 33:25.020
but I do miss the seasons.
Dad.

33:25.220 --> 33:26.350
I've been calling you.

33:26.550 --> 33:28.720
Well, I do remember
the phone buzzing.

33:28.920 --> 33:30.290
I told you not
to put it on vibrate.

33:30.490 --> 33:31.790
I get tired of
these telemarketers.

33:31.990 --> 33:35.030
Just kept calling.
If I wanted solar power,

33:35.230 --> 33:36.160
I'd call them, you know?

33:36.360 --> 33:38.800
This-this is my son Osama.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.230
Hello. C-Could you
excuse us, please?

33:41.430 --> 33:44.090
Dad, Dad, Dad. Dad.

33:45.550 --> 33:46.500
Where's the fire?

33:46.700 --> 33:48.110
What are you doing back here?

33:48.310 --> 33:50.270
You were the one who wanted
to work out, remember?

33:50.470 --> 33:53.910
Dad, we did work out. Remember?

33:54.110 --> 33:56.250
I think if we'd have worked out
this morning,

33:56.450 --> 33:57.980
I would have remembered.

33:58.180 --> 33:59.420
You are working too hard.

33:59.620 --> 34:03.900
You need to slow down.
Enjoy life a bit.

34:05.270 --> 34:06.910
Okay.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.560
(chuckling): Oh.

34:10.760 --> 34:12.850
Yeah, we did work out
this morning, didn't we?

34:14.050 --> 34:15.080
We worked out.

34:16.280 --> 34:19.370
A little bit early in the day
for me to be forgetting things.

34:19.570 --> 34:20.500
That's all
the more reason for you

34:20.700 --> 34:22.140
to reconsider
that drug trial.

34:22.340 --> 34:23.440
They're showing
promising results.

34:23.640 --> 34:26.010
For who? For the
pharmaceutical company.

34:26.210 --> 34:27.510
There was a doctor

34:27.710 --> 34:29.280
on CNN a while back.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.010
He said he would not take
any treatment

34:31.220 --> 34:34.620
for his health after 75.
And he was a doctor.

34:34.820 --> 34:36.650
He was never a Marine.

34:36.850 --> 34:38.290
(grunts)

34:38.490 --> 34:41.960
I've never known you to take
yourself out of the fight, Pop.

34:42.160 --> 34:43.510
What's going on?

34:45.980 --> 34:48.870
Okay. What the hell? I ain't
gonna live forever, right?

34:49.070 --> 34:50.070
Hooyah.

34:50.270 --> 34:51.590
Oorah.

34:52.650 --> 34:54.920
(chuckles)
Thanks, Dad.

34:55.920 --> 34:58.210
You know,
when you were a kid,

34:58.410 --> 35:01.010
after supper, I used to take
you for walks in the park.

35:01.210 --> 35:05.180
Used to try to tire you out
in the, in the jungle gyms

35:05.380 --> 35:07.050
and give your
poor mama a break.

35:07.250 --> 35:08.590
(chuckles)

35:08.790 --> 35:09.920
You remember that?

35:10.120 --> 35:11.090
Oh, I remember that.

35:11.290 --> 35:13.190
Yeah, me, too.

35:13.390 --> 35:15.190
(laughs)

35:15.390 --> 35:16.780
Yeah.

35:20.480 --> 35:21.970
KENSI:
(sighs) You hear anything?

35:22.170 --> 35:23.600
Not well.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.000
They're playing video games.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.900
Speaking of which,
we should get that new Xbox.

35:27.100 --> 35:28.090
(groans)

35:29.760 --> 35:30.670
You sure you're okay?

35:30.870 --> 35:33.930
Yeah. I'm fine.
Yeah?

35:34.730 --> 35:36.810
You know what? We should
get those full body scans.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.250
What for?

35:38.450 --> 35:39.550
What do you mean "what for"?

35:39.750 --> 35:41.490
Better safe than sorry.
We got Rosa now.

35:41.690 --> 35:42.650
Besides the fact
the Doomsday Clock

35:42.850 --> 35:43.950
is 90 seconds to midnight.

35:44.150 --> 35:45.860
And do you know
what that means?
No.

35:46.060 --> 35:47.890
What does a full body scan have
to do with a Doomsday Clock?

35:48.090 --> 35:50.760
Maybe nothing. I'm just saying
that 90 seconds to midnight--

35:50.960 --> 35:52.930
we have never as
a human species

35:53.130 --> 35:54.770
been closer to
total annihilation.

35:54.970 --> 35:56.570
Well, why don't they
just reset the clock?

35:56.770 --> 35:57.770
You... No, that's...

35:57.970 --> 35:59.240
You can't just reset the clock.

35:59.440 --> 36:00.500
Why not?

36:00.700 --> 36:02.770
Because it doesn't
work like that.

36:02.970 --> 36:04.810
Why don't they just unplug it
and stop the countdown?

36:05.010 --> 36:05.780
You can't...

36:05.980 --> 36:07.410
You can't unplug it, Kensi,

36:07.610 --> 36:08.850
because it's not
an actual clock.

36:09.050 --> 36:09.910
Then if it's not
a real clock,

36:10.110 --> 36:11.870
what are you so worried about?

36:12.700 --> 36:14.120
I think I got something.

36:14.320 --> 36:15.350
Sort of.

36:15.550 --> 36:16.450
What do you mean "sort of"?

36:16.650 --> 36:17.350
You got Newsome?
What do you got?

36:17.550 --> 36:21.120
No... it's a new player.

36:21.330 --> 36:23.180
And he's heading inside.

36:27.610 --> 36:29.870
* I'm-a take your crown *

36:30.070 --> 36:31.270
* Man, better run *

36:31.470 --> 36:32.340
* Gonna hunt you down... *

36:32.540 --> 36:34.410
Yo. Look alive.

36:34.610 --> 36:36.470
Boss man said the payment
just cleared.

36:36.670 --> 36:37.970
Timeline's moving up.

36:38.170 --> 36:40.240
We're gonna deliver
the merch today.

36:40.440 --> 36:41.450
NEWSOME:
Deliver the merch?

36:41.650 --> 36:42.950
We don't even have merch.

36:43.150 --> 36:44.720
Where are these weapons anyway?

36:44.920 --> 36:46.680
* I got blood, sweat and tears
under my belt *

36:46.880 --> 36:48.080
* And now
I'm switching gears... *

36:48.290 --> 36:49.820
DION:
I don't like all
your questions.

36:50.020 --> 36:51.720
You don't like 'em or
you don't understand 'em?

36:51.920 --> 36:55.230
Seventh grade education
ain't what it used to be, huh?

36:55.430 --> 36:57.890
I'm gonna smack those smart
words right out of your head.

36:58.090 --> 37:00.200
What's that? I don't hear
so good out of these.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.470
I said I'm gonna...

37:01.670 --> 37:03.000
(grunting)

37:03.200 --> 37:05.170
* Yeah, I ain't playin' around *

37:05.370 --> 37:07.300
* I'm-a take your crown *

37:07.500 --> 37:09.610
* Man, better run,
gonna hunt you down *

37:09.810 --> 37:12.510
* <i>Tell 'em</i> *
* Yeah, I'll be coming for you
like Hannibal *

37:12.710 --> 37:13.810
* Uh, I'm a killer... *

37:14.010 --> 37:15.410
I'm taking this now.

37:15.610 --> 37:17.310
You're gonna have to show me
you can use a knife like this

37:17.510 --> 37:18.820
before you get it back.

37:19.020 --> 37:20.550
We good?

37:20.750 --> 37:22.420
Yeah.
Yeah.

37:22.620 --> 37:23.550
Good.

37:23.750 --> 37:24.960
* Tried to keep us underground *

37:25.160 --> 37:26.220
* But the top is
where we're found... *

37:26.420 --> 37:28.230
(pinball machine ringing)

37:28.430 --> 37:32.310
So, are we his overwatch,
or is he ours?

37:33.310 --> 37:34.430
I'm just saying.

37:34.630 --> 37:36.200
(beeping)

37:36.400 --> 37:37.620
Oh, my.

37:39.290 --> 37:40.700
What's up?

37:40.900 --> 37:43.790
I just did something
I probably shouldn't have.

37:44.590 --> 37:46.540
You accessed
SAC Adams' financials

37:46.740 --> 37:48.780
without a warrant
or a subpoena?

37:48.980 --> 37:50.480
I know, okay?
It was on a hunch.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.320
I don't know what
I was thinking.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.020
Yeah, you clearly weren't.

37:54.220 --> 37:54.990
(sighs)

37:55.190 --> 37:56.420
We have to tell the admiral.

37:56.620 --> 37:59.420
We? (laughs)

37:59.620 --> 38:01.070
You.

38:04.710 --> 38:05.730
Great.

38:05.930 --> 38:07.360
SAM:
<i>Newsome's boss is dirty?</i>

38:07.560 --> 38:12.070
Yeah. It seems that Special
Agent in Charge Kerry Adams

38:12.270 --> 38:13.900
has been on the take for years.

38:14.100 --> 38:16.470
Unfortunately,
the U.S. Attorney's Office

38:16.670 --> 38:19.880
will be unable to use
this evidence against Adams.

38:20.080 --> 38:21.140
We got an address on her?

38:21.340 --> 38:22.810
KILBRIDE:
It was sent to your phones.

38:23.010 --> 38:25.380
We still don't know where
these weapons came from

38:25.580 --> 38:27.050
or where they're going.

38:27.250 --> 38:29.320
But if we can catch her
with them,

38:29.520 --> 38:30.650
we might still have a case.

38:30.850 --> 38:32.320
Copy that. We're on it.

38:32.520 --> 38:33.710
(engine revving)

38:35.380 --> 38:36.690
(engine roaring)

38:36.890 --> 38:38.980
(tires squealing)

38:43.550 --> 38:45.800
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.960
Right now, exit the vehicle.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.580
What the hell is going on?

38:56.780 --> 38:58.320
Show us your hands.

38:58.520 --> 39:00.480
Have you lost your minds?

39:00.680 --> 39:02.240
Now!

39:21.220 --> 39:23.260
I can't get
to the long guns!

39:41.680 --> 39:43.660
FATIMA:
Guys, you're outgunned.

39:43.860 --> 39:46.030
You two need to move.

39:46.230 --> 39:49.800
