00:02.723 --> 00:04.724
No, keep it rolling.
Keep it rolling!

00:04.791 --> 00:06.993
The press conference
was just about to start now,

00:07.060 --> 00:09.695
But the ground and wall
just started shaking!

00:09.763 --> 00:12.231
There's this noise!
Wait!

00:12.299 --> 00:13.833
Something's happening!

00:13.834 --> 00:16.369
No, i don't know!
I'm not sure what this is!

00:16.436 --> 00:18.804
Oh, my god!
Aah! Oh, my god!

00:50.404 --> 00:52.038
And your carryon luggage

Either in the overhead bin

00:53.440 --> 00:55.107
Or under the seat
in front of you.

00:55.108 --> 00:57.677
Now is the time also
to switch off all electronics.

00:57.744 --> 00:59.245
The captain will let you
know when it's safe

00:59.246 --> 01:01.180

01:03.116 --> 01:04.483
Sorry.

01:04.483 --> 01:06.953
Can i get you some
no, i'm all right. Thanks.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.721
Your cabin crew
will be bringing around

01:08.722 --> 01:10.323
A beverage of your choice,

01:10.324 --> 01:12.825
But for now, sit back,
relax, and enjoy your flight.

01:15.195 --> 01:17.129

01:17.197 --> 01:19.332
Oh.

01:32.579 --> 01:34.013
Oh.

01:34.014 --> 01:35.748
You all right?
Yeah, yeah.

01:35.749 --> 01:37.750
I'm fine. I'm fine.

02:04.244 --> 02:07.713

02:07.781 --> 02:10.816
Five, six, seven...

02:10.883 --> 02:12.585
This is gonna be
great on you.

02:12.586 --> 02:14.487
Just make sure
that you bring it back.

02:14.554 --> 02:16.055
I don't think
that's gonna fit.

02:16.056 --> 02:17.890
Of course it's gonna fit.
16, 17...

02:17.891 --> 02:19.158
samantha,
can you please stop?

02:19.159 --> 02:20.660
You're gonna thank me
that i gave you that,

02:20.661 --> 02:23.262
Because it gets chilly
on those cruise ships at night,

02:23.330 --> 02:25.230
So i want you
to wear that.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.266
Mom, i promise.
Yeah, you're gonna wear it.

02:27.334 --> 02:28.801
I'm gonna wear it.
You better wear it.

02:28.802 --> 02:30.469
Good. Samantha,
will you please stop?

02:30.470 --> 02:33.706
Fine. But, mom,
can i go on a cruise?

02:33.774 --> 02:36.676
Samantha.
You want to go on a cruise?

02:36.743 --> 02:38.577
Yeah!
Take me, take me, take me!

02:38.578 --> 02:40.413
Not this time,
but you know what?

02:40.414 --> 02:42.348
Maybe next.

02:42.416 --> 02:44.750
This time, you have to watch
mom and dad, okay?

02:44.818 --> 02:45.885
All right.
All right?

02:45.886 --> 02:47.786
Pinkie promise?
Pinkie promise.

02:48.322 --> 02:50.122
This is the main line
for the ship.

02:50.123 --> 02:52.058
But they said that
we should have a cell signal...

02:52.125 --> 02:53.793
okay, great.
Most of the time anyway.

02:53.794 --> 02:55.027
All right, don't worry.

02:55.028 --> 02:57.096
We'll leave you lovebirds
alone this time.

02:57.164 --> 02:59.265
Oh, no, that
i justi'm...

02:59.333 --> 03:03.369
yeah, i just
was thinking, um...

03:05.906 --> 03:08.641
uh, listen, um...

03:08.709 --> 03:10.109
i know
that this is, uh

03:10.110 --> 03:12.745
Probably isn't the, uh,
best time to do this,

03:12.813 --> 03:15.147
Since we're leaving
very soon, but, um...

03:15.215 --> 03:17.983
i just wanted
to talk to you before we go,

03:18.051 --> 03:20.286
And i know this
is kind of oldfashioned.

03:20.354 --> 03:22.288
It's completely
oldfashioned, actually,

03:22.356 --> 03:24.223
But i also know
how much you love your daughter,

03:24.224 --> 03:25.791
Uh, obviously,
and, um...

03:25.792 --> 03:29.328
sean, relax,
you have my blessing.

03:29.396 --> 03:30.696
I do?

03:30.697 --> 03:32.164
Well, you're gonna take
good care of her,

03:32.165 --> 03:33.799
Love her, cherish her,
all that good stuff, right?

03:33.800 --> 03:36.402
Yes. Yes, yes, of course.
Absolutely.

03:36.470 --> 03:38.170
Good.

03:38.171 --> 03:42.641
Then you have
my blessing, hmm?

03:42.709 --> 03:45.177
Oh, that was easier
than i thought.

03:45.245 --> 03:47.079
Of course,
if you hurt her in any way,

03:47.080 --> 03:49.348
I will have to kill you.

03:51.418 --> 03:53.619
Yes, i get that.

03:53.687 --> 03:55.587
Bye, shorty.
This is mine, right?

03:55.589 --> 03:56.789
Yes, that's right.

03:56.790 --> 03:58.290
You take care, okay, mom?

03:58.291 --> 03:59.592
All right, see you
in a bit, okay?

03:59.593 --> 04:00.659
Bye.

04:00.660 --> 04:01.961
Everybody sure
they got everything?

04:01.962 --> 04:03.162
Yes.
Bye.

04:03.163 --> 04:05.498
Sean?
Yes, sir.

04:05.565 --> 04:08.134
Bye, sweetie.
Bye.

04:08.201 --> 04:09.935
Okay, then...

04:09.936 --> 04:11.836
cleared for departure.

04:49.509 --> 04:51.409
Sir, you need
to sit down, please.

04:51.411 --> 04:54.580
Sir, please sitaah!
He's got a gun!

04:54.648 --> 04:56.282

04:56.283 --> 04:58.851
He's got a gun!

04:58.852 --> 05:05.757
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

Come on!

05:16.436 --> 05:17.603
Come on, pick up!

05:17.604 --> 05:18.771
Fred decosta.

05:18.772 --> 05:20.406
Are you the man
in charge?

05:20.407 --> 05:23.342
Well, for the next
nine minutes, yes, i am.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.177
Okay, listen to me
carefully, fred.

05:25.178 --> 05:27.112
There's a terrorist
on flight 514.

05:27.180 --> 05:28.981
Do not let it take off.

05:28.982 --> 05:31.517
You need to stop that plane,
or many people will die!

05:31.585 --> 05:33.319
Okay, listen, if this
is some kind of a joke

05:33.320 --> 05:35.821
Hey, look, fred, we really
don't have time for this, okay?

05:35.889 --> 05:37.122
Justjust tell me,

05:37.123 --> 05:38.757
What would it take
for you to stop that plane?

05:38.758 --> 05:41.360
A bomb threat,
would that do it?

05:41.428 --> 05:44.230
Okay, fine, there's a bomb
on flight 514.

05:44.297 --> 05:46.298
Did you hear me?

05:46.366 --> 05:47.533
Yeah.

05:47.534 --> 05:49.434
Yeah, i heard you.

06:01.848 --> 06:04.250
We've recaptured william.

06:04.317 --> 06:05.518
That's why i'm here.

06:05.519 --> 06:07.353
We finally
tracked him down

06:07.354 --> 06:09.121
Hiding in plain sight
in los angeles.

06:09.122 --> 06:11.123
Extracted him two days ago.

06:11.191 --> 06:13.993
You found him...
after all this time.

06:14.060 --> 06:15.327
Yeah, he's, uh

06:15.328 --> 06:17.963
He's not exactly thrilled
about being back.

06:18.031 --> 06:20.599
And we may have a problem.

06:20.667 --> 06:23.235
He thinks he can buy
his freedom back,

06:23.303 --> 06:24.803
Trade it for information.

06:24.804 --> 06:27.039
What kind of information?

06:29.242 --> 06:32.845
He's going to tell them
about the event.

06:34.347 --> 06:35.814
He can't.

06:35.815 --> 06:38.017
He's going to.

06:38.084 --> 06:41.620
You have to convince him
to change his mind.

06:41.688 --> 06:45.190
Do whatever it takes.

06:45.258 --> 06:48.627
Don't you think
we should at least warn them,

06:48.695 --> 06:51.597
So they can prepare?

06:51.665 --> 06:54.333
There's a new president
in the white housemartinez.

06:54.401 --> 06:56.702
He's a good man.
I think he would help us.

06:56.770 --> 06:58.370
Presidents
haven't helped us before.

06:58.371 --> 07:00.105
And even
if he is a good man,

07:00.106 --> 07:01.540
Whitman and the others

07:01.541 --> 07:03.042
Won't let him find out
about this place.

07:03.043 --> 07:05.511
Yeah, well, i'll make sure
he finds out.

07:05.579 --> 07:07.813
Simon, you are
my only conduit to the outside.

07:07.881 --> 07:10.616
If our people out there
are having doubts,

07:10.684 --> 07:13.352
I need you to reason
with them.

07:13.420 --> 07:16.855
We have to protect
ourselves.

07:19.326 --> 07:22.027
Can i count on you?

07:34.741 --> 07:36.475
Take her
back to her quarters.

07:36.476 --> 07:38.376
Yes, sir.

07:40.380 --> 07:42.481
Well, what are
you waiting for, fred?

07:42.549 --> 07:44.116
Just do it!
Okay, okay.

07:44.117 --> 07:45.584
Who's got avias 514?

07:45.585 --> 07:46.952
Right here, boss.

07:46.953 --> 07:48.587
Take her
to the emergency bomb area.

07:48.588 --> 07:50.389
Do it.
Yes, sir.

07:50.390 --> 07:52.224
Avias 514, cancel takeoff.

07:52.225 --> 07:55.260
Clearance taxi, clear a runway
and contact onepointniner.

07:55.328 --> 07:56.629
I did what you asked.

07:56.630 --> 07:58.497
Nownow, who are you,
and what do you want?

07:58.498 --> 08:00.733
Who i am doesn't matter.
Just stop that plane.

08:00.800 --> 08:04.136
514, this is miami tower,
do you copy?

08:04.204 --> 08:06.104
Sir, i'm not
getting a response.

08:06.106 --> 08:07.740
Try calling them on guard.

08:07.741 --> 08:09.775
Sir, they just turned off
their transponder.

08:09.843 --> 08:12.544
We lost him.

08:12.612 --> 08:13.912
Hello?

08:13.913 --> 08:16.448
We're too late!

08:16.516 --> 08:18.350
Hello

08:18.351 --> 08:20.386
They're offline.
We're offline.

08:20.453 --> 08:21.687
Radar's down.

08:21.688 --> 08:24.623
Fred, radar's down.
Entire system is down.

08:24.691 --> 08:26.591
There they are.

08:26.626 --> 08:29.495
They're gonna take off.

08:43.543 --> 08:45.443
You ain't getting by me!
Come on!

09:26.853 --> 09:28.787
Come on. Come on!

09:28.855 --> 09:31.623
Stop, you son of a bitch!

09:34.394 --> 09:36.795
Ah, ah, damn it!

09:46.406 --> 09:48.207
Simon...

09:48.208 --> 09:50.609
did you intercept him?
I couldn't stop him.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.577
They're airborne.

10:17.305 --> 10:20.073
Sir, you need
to sit down, please.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.375
Sir, please sitaah!

10:22.443 --> 10:24.044
Get over there!

10:24.045 --> 10:25.612
He's got a gun!

10:25.613 --> 10:26.680
Get back in the corner!

10:26.681 --> 10:28.248
Get back there, okay?

10:28.249 --> 10:29.382
Now stay there.

10:29.383 --> 10:31.283
Open the door!

10:31.285 --> 10:33.453
You don't have to do this!

10:33.521 --> 10:34.788
Sir...

10:34.789 --> 10:36.056
We can figure
this out together!

10:36.057 --> 10:37.223
You have to open the door!

10:37.224 --> 10:40.126
Get back. Back!

10:40.194 --> 10:41.962

10:42.964 --> 10:44.531
Uh, uh, nno.

10:44.532 --> 10:45.665
Can you open the door?
No, no!

10:45.666 --> 10:47.500
Please!
No, i can't. I can't.

10:47.501 --> 10:49.035
Well, how do i talk
to the pilot?

10:49.036 --> 10:51.271
Uh, it's...
how do i talk to the pilot?

10:51.339 --> 10:52.739
Okay, okay, it's
the middle button on the phone.

10:52.740 --> 10:54.474
The middle button on the phone.
This one?

10:54.475 --> 10:56.375
Yes.

10:59.347 --> 11:00.847
Just let me in.

11:00.848 --> 11:05.085
Okay, it's not too late,
but we have to act now.

11:05.152 --> 11:06.386
Open the door!

11:06.387 --> 11:08.254
Come on!
Open it up!

11:08.255 --> 11:09.556
Drop the gun!

11:09.557 --> 11:11.925
Son, i'm an air marshal.
I'm not gonna ask twice.

11:11.993 --> 11:13.893
Drop the gun now
and get your hands up,

11:13.928 --> 11:15.195
Or i will shoot you!

11:15.196 --> 11:17.330
This isn't what it looks like.
Do it now!

11:28.275 --> 11:31.344
All right, come on, let's go.
All right, all right.

11:31.412 --> 11:33.079
Okay, come on.

11:33.080 --> 11:34.980
You got it?

11:34.982 --> 11:36.882
Got it.

11:38.219 --> 11:41.521
¶ all of a sudden,
it's the summertime ¶

11:41.589 --> 11:43.556
¶ it's changed so quickly,
and i don't know why ¶

11:43.624 --> 11:45.458
Hey.

11:45.459 --> 11:46.960
How's the water?
Is it nice?

11:46.961 --> 11:48.461
It's nice.
It's warm.

11:48.462 --> 11:49.829
I love it.

11:49.830 --> 11:51.097
How's the book?

11:51.098 --> 11:52.799
I can't focus.
There's too much going on,

11:52.800 --> 11:53.967
'Cause i've been enjoying
the view.

11:53.968 --> 11:55.335
I'm gonna get
sand everywhere.

11:55.336 --> 11:57.270
Oh, i know. I wish the beach
wasn't so sandy.

11:57.338 --> 12:01.074
Why does it always
have to be so sandy?

12:01.142 --> 12:02.442
¶ it's all right now ¶

12:02.443 --> 12:03.710
¶ it's all right ¶

Okay, so, um,
it's almost 1:00.

12:06.680 --> 12:10.950
I say we grab some lunch,
and then we do the hike.

12:11.018 --> 12:12.752
Okay.
Okay?

12:12.753 --> 12:19.592

12:23.097 --> 12:24.497
Yeah,
i knew you'd like it.

12:24.498 --> 12:26.199
That was the plan.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.734
What are you talking about?

12:27.735 --> 12:29.969
I thought you said the guy
at the shop told you about it.

12:30.037 --> 12:32.172
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, i kind of lied about that.

12:32.239 --> 12:33.406
What?
No.

12:33.407 --> 12:36.209
Uh, can we
can we just stop for a sec?

12:36.277 --> 12:37.277
Um...

12:37.278 --> 12:38.711
yeah.
Can't keep up?

12:38.712 --> 12:40.547
I can...
i can keep up.

12:40.548 --> 12:41.848
No, ii, uh...

12:41.849 --> 12:43.883
okay, you know
how we're always talking

12:43.951 --> 12:45.985
About getting away from it all

12:46.053 --> 12:48.054
And the two of us just going off
and living somewhere

12:48.122 --> 12:50.423
On a desertedisland paradise
somewhere?

12:50.491 --> 12:51.624
Yeah.

12:51.625 --> 12:53.893
Yeah, but then we get
caught up in things,

12:53.961 --> 12:56.963
And we forget that places
like this actually exist,

12:57.031 --> 12:59.833
So i just wanted
to bring you here

12:59.900 --> 13:03.903
And sort of freeze
this moment in time.

13:03.971 --> 13:05.839
What's...

13:05.840 --> 13:09.909
what's going on?

13:09.977 --> 13:12.579
Leila buchanan, uh...

13:12.646 --> 13:14.546
yes?

13:15.583 --> 13:18.084
Whenwhen i first met you

13:18.152 --> 13:20.420
Five years ago,

13:20.488 --> 13:23.790
Um, i thought that i...
help!

13:23.858 --> 13:27.293
Somebody help me, please!

13:27.361 --> 13:29.262
Please help!
Help!

13:29.330 --> 13:31.230
Somebody!

13:31.232 --> 13:33.032
Help! Help!

13:33.033 --> 13:34.634
Somebody help me!

13:34.635 --> 13:36.836
Help! My girlfriend,
she fell!

13:36.904 --> 13:38.972
She slipped! I don't know
she was taking a picture,

13:39.039 --> 13:40.340
And i think she hit her head!

13:40.341 --> 13:41.875
Is there a way to climb down?
No, no, no, no!

13:41.876 --> 13:43.309
She won't make it
that long, please!

13:43.310 --> 13:45.445
You've got to help me!
I can't swim with this cast!

13:45.513 --> 13:47.981
Vicky! Hang on!

13:48.048 --> 13:49.749
Please help me!

13:49.750 --> 13:50.950
Vicky, hang on!

13:50.951 --> 13:52.385
Sean, what are you doing?
Sean!

13:52.386 --> 13:53.753
Are you kidding?
You can't do that!

13:53.754 --> 13:55.922
I'll be fine.
You're gonna break your neck!

13:55.990 --> 13:58.091
Are you kidding?
Sean!

13:58.159 --> 14:00.059
Sean!

14:02.663 --> 14:04.230
Sean!
Vicky, hold on!

14:04.231 --> 14:06.131
He's coming!
Sean!

14:11.639 --> 14:14.307
Sean!
Swim!

14:40.201 --> 14:42.101
Hold on, baby!
He's coming!

14:47.208 --> 14:49.108
Whoo! Vicky!

14:49.143 --> 14:51.043
He's got her.

14:51.045 --> 14:54.080
Stop fighting.
Stop fighting.

14:54.148 --> 14:57.250
Thank you!

14:57.318 --> 14:59.218
You okay?

15:00.287 --> 15:02.689
Breathe.
I got you.

15:02.756 --> 15:04.656
I got you.

15:05.726 --> 15:07.694
Uh, it's been a long day.

15:07.761 --> 15:08.962
I think we're gonna...

15:08.963 --> 15:10.563
No. No, no, no,
come on, guys.

15:10.564 --> 15:11.598
Stay with us.

15:11.599 --> 15:12.999
Yeah, i totally
owe you one.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.100
No, don't worry
about it.

15:14.101 --> 15:16.369
It was just, um,
instincts, you know.

15:16.437 --> 15:19.372
You guys are lucky
that sean's a great swimmer.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.441
Oh, man, i am so glad
you were there.

15:21.508 --> 15:22.842
You have no idea,
seriously.

15:22.843 --> 15:24.410
And, you, you,
come here.

15:24.411 --> 15:27.780
I am never letting you
near the edge of anything

15:27.848 --> 15:30.383
Anytime soon.

15:30.451 --> 15:33.486
Mmm.

15:37.725 --> 15:39.759
I just leaned over
to take a picture,

15:39.827 --> 15:41.527
And next thing you know,

15:41.528 --> 15:43.329
Bam, it was like
i got hit by a truck.

15:43.330 --> 15:44.597
I had no idea where i was.

15:44.598 --> 15:46.199
That was a long drop.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.100
Swimming around aimlessly.

15:48.102 --> 15:50.403
It's my parents.

15:50.471 --> 15:53.640
Guys, i'll be right back.

15:53.707 --> 15:56.075
She is so cute.

15:56.143 --> 15:57.677
You know she's hot,
sean, right?

15:57.678 --> 15:58.845
Oh, yeah.

15:58.846 --> 16:01.214
Yes, i know.
Both of those things are true.

16:01.282 --> 16:02.348
Hey, dad.

16:02.349 --> 16:04.050
Hey, sweetheart,
how's st. Lucia?

16:04.051 --> 16:06.386
You guys sound like
you're having a good time.

16:06.453 --> 16:07.754
Yeah, we're, uh...

16:07.755 --> 16:10.056
just having some drinks
with some...

16:12.326 --> 16:14.661
new friends.

16:14.728 --> 16:15.995
Who else is there?

16:15.996 --> 16:18.731
Oh, no one, sweetie.
It's just the tv.

16:18.799 --> 16:21.000
...in an attempt
to reassure the country.

16:21.068 --> 16:23.102
So, look, your mom and i
just wanted to check in.

16:23.170 --> 16:25.872
You know, dad, it's
really loud with the music,

16:25.939 --> 16:29.742
So if i could call you
back, uh, tomorrow

16:29.810 --> 16:31.644
When it's less noisy,
that'd be great.

16:31.645 --> 16:32.812
Yeah, let's do that.

16:32.813 --> 16:34.781
Well, tell mom and sam
i said hi.

16:34.848 --> 16:36.449
I will.
Love you, pumpkin.

16:36.450 --> 16:37.984
All right,
i love you, dad.

16:37.985 --> 16:38.985
Bye.

16:38.986 --> 16:40.887
Fresh drinks!

16:40.954 --> 16:42.655
Oh!
Drink up.

16:42.656 --> 16:44.991
Idea
you know what we should do?

16:45.059 --> 16:47.360
We should all hang out
for the rest of the cruise.

16:47.428 --> 16:49.328
Right?
Do excursions together.

16:49.363 --> 16:52.098
I wanted to go
snorkeling tomorrow,

16:52.166 --> 16:53.466
But i don't want
to do it by myself,

16:53.467 --> 16:54.667
'Cause he can't go.
Can't go!

16:54.668 --> 16:56.836
Broken!

16:56.904 --> 16:59.138
Will you guys come?

16:59.206 --> 17:00.740
Say you'll come.
It'll be so much fun.

17:00.741 --> 17:02.041
Come on.

17:02.042 --> 17:03.509
Come on, come on, come on.

17:03.510 --> 17:04.844
It'll be fun.

17:04.845 --> 17:07.313
Yeah.
Yay!

17:07.381 --> 17:09.449
All right!
Snorkel buddies!

17:09.516 --> 17:11.017
Ow!
Cool.

17:11.018 --> 17:12.785
Shots.
Shots!

17:12.786 --> 17:14.252
I'lli'll do one shot.

17:14.253 --> 17:17.957
Are they beginning
to get on your nerves, too,

17:18.025 --> 17:19.291
Or was that just me?

17:19.292 --> 17:21.094
No, yeah,
they're a little weird,

17:21.095 --> 17:22.994
But in a kind of a fun way.

17:23.030 --> 17:25.765
Oh, my god,
could they drink.

17:25.833 --> 17:27.333
Yes.

17:27.334 --> 17:30.169
You know, i'm not convinced
that he was totally sober

17:30.237 --> 17:32.605
When you fished her out.

17:32.673 --> 17:35.808
Uh, it's all beginning
to make sense.

17:35.876 --> 17:37.076
Yeah, you see?

17:37.077 --> 17:39.112
5313?

17:39.179 --> 17:40.313
Yes.

17:40.314 --> 17:42.181
Yeah, that's
that's not us.

17:42.182 --> 17:44.550
That's not us.
No.

17:44.618 --> 17:46.252
5314.

17:46.253 --> 17:48.621
Yep.
This is us.

17:48.689 --> 17:50.690
This is us, definitely.

17:50.758 --> 17:52.959
Uhoh.
Wait.

17:53.026 --> 17:55.094
Put it in there.

17:55.162 --> 17:58.831
Come on, there you go.

17:58.899 --> 18:00.799
Ohh!

18:18.419 --> 18:20.186
Okay, wait.
Wait.

18:20.187 --> 18:23.556
What, what?
I think i drank too much.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.661
You need some fresh air?

18:28.729 --> 18:31.764
I think that'd be
a good idea.

18:31.832 --> 18:33.732
Okay.

18:42.709 --> 18:45.778
Okay, can
can we make a deal?

18:48.515 --> 18:51.984
Tomorrow,
after the snorkeling thing,

18:52.052 --> 18:54.487
Can we just go
into antigua

18:54.555 --> 18:55.888
And find
a nice little restaurant

18:55.889 --> 18:59.292
And have a romantic dinner,
just the two of us?

18:59.359 --> 19:01.994
No greg, no vicky?

19:02.062 --> 19:04.797
I would love that.

19:04.865 --> 19:06.765
Okay. Good.

19:20.514 --> 19:23.749
Oh, my dad called,
by the way.

19:23.817 --> 19:25.451
Oh, yeah?

19:25.452 --> 19:26.986
He says hi.

19:26.987 --> 19:31.457
Hi, dad.

19:41.635 --> 19:43.035
Drop the gun!

19:43.036 --> 19:45.104
Now!

19:45.172 --> 19:46.439
Get the gun.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.708
Listen, listen,
when this is all over,

19:48.775 --> 19:50.443
You can arrest me
all you want,

19:50.444 --> 19:52.278
But right now
we have to get into the cockpit.

19:52.279 --> 19:53.446
You or me, i don't care!

19:53.447 --> 19:54.747
Tell the pilot
to turn the plane around.

19:54.748 --> 19:56.115
You get your hands
behind your back.

19:56.116 --> 19:58.885
Get your hands
behind your back!

19:58.952 --> 19:59.952
Now!

19:59.953 --> 20:02.221
Okay, all right.

20:05.692 --> 20:08.127
Oh, my god.

20:08.195 --> 20:11.230
What the

20:19.473 --> 20:22.675
What the hell was that?
Who's in there?

20:46.274 --> 20:49.076
Hi.
Hey, how you doing?

20:56.218 --> 20:58.119
Okay, three, two...

20:58.186 --> 21:00.221
wait a minute!

21:00.288 --> 21:02.323
<i>Feliz cumpleaños, david.</i>

21:02.390 --> 21:03.858
<i>Feliz cumpleaños,
mi amor.</i>

21:03.859 --> 21:05.759
Who wants cake?
All: me!

21:05.794 --> 21:07.795
Hi, christina.
I'll have to pass on the cake.

21:07.863 --> 21:10.030
Okay, no cake
for the vice president,

21:10.098 --> 21:11.998
But everyone else
wants some, right?

21:12.033 --> 21:15.703
Yeah!
Me! Me!

21:15.770 --> 21:17.972
Sorry, got to go.

21:18.039 --> 21:20.341
It's okay.

21:20.408 --> 21:22.309
So this is, what,
an intervention?

21:22.377 --> 21:24.879
Mr. President,
you're making a mistake,

21:24.946 --> 21:27.014
And everyone here agrees.

21:27.082 --> 21:30.217
What director sterling
is saying

21:30.285 --> 21:34.021
Is that we want to urge you
to reconsider

21:34.089 --> 21:35.823
One more time.

21:35.824 --> 21:38.692
Yeah.
No, i'm not changing my mind.

21:38.760 --> 21:39.827
I'm not.

21:39.828 --> 21:41.195
We're closing the facility.

21:41.196 --> 21:42.630
How many times have
we had this discussion?

21:42.631 --> 21:43.931
Too many times.

21:43.932 --> 21:47.034
I understand your family
had it rough back in cuba,

21:47.102 --> 21:48.602
But you can't let
personal feelings

21:48.603 --> 21:49.603
Affect your decisions...

21:49.604 --> 21:50.671
blake
not when the safety

21:50.672 --> 21:52.006
Of our citizens
is at stake.

21:52.007 --> 21:53.974
You're saying
i'm unable to be objective

21:54.042 --> 21:55.876
Because of my background
is that what you're saying?

21:55.877 --> 21:58.078
With all due respect, sir,
that is exactly what i'm saying.

21:58.146 --> 21:59.313
Blake, please.

21:59.314 --> 22:01.081
No, no, no, let him talk.
Let him talk.

22:01.082 --> 22:02.950
We sacrifice
the rights of the few

22:02.951 --> 22:05.319
For the safety of the many
all the time.

22:05.387 --> 22:08.689
Now, you want to do
the noble thing.

22:08.757 --> 22:09.757
I get it.

22:09.758 --> 22:11.658
But now is not the time.

22:11.693 --> 22:13.861
Now is the perfect time.

22:13.929 --> 22:16.230
It's not just about protecting
the rights of the few.

22:16.298 --> 22:18.465
This is about protecting
human rights.

22:18.533 --> 22:21.001
Now, these people
may not be americans,

22:21.069 --> 22:22.102
But we are.

22:22.103 --> 22:24.104
Look what we have done
to them.

22:24.172 --> 22:25.606
We've abused them.

22:25.607 --> 22:26.674
We've detained them,

22:26.675 --> 22:30.544
Illegally,
after all this time.

22:30.612 --> 22:32.513
That's not
what this country's about,

22:32.581 --> 22:33.814
Not anymore.

22:33.815 --> 22:35.715
Gentlemen, we
no, no, no, no, no.

22:35.717 --> 22:36.884
What you're about to do

22:36.885 --> 22:38.452
Is gonna make
a lot of americans nervous,

22:38.453 --> 22:40.054
Myself included,

22:40.055 --> 22:42.256
So how are we supposed
to reassure the public

22:42.324 --> 22:44.491
When we don't have
answers yet?

22:44.559 --> 22:47.995
Eli, what
it comes down to is,

22:48.063 --> 22:50.431
We don't have
enough information

22:50.498 --> 22:52.299
To feel safe enough
to let them out.

22:52.300 --> 22:54.602
Mr. President...

22:54.669 --> 22:56.604
it's not too late
to cancel the press conference.

23:01.276 --> 23:04.211
Even if i delayed
this announcement,

23:04.279 --> 23:07.147
We have already granted
one reporter exclusive access

23:07.215 --> 23:08.983
To keep a lid
on this until today.

23:08.984 --> 23:10.317
Guys, it's too late.

23:10.318 --> 23:11.819
The information
is already out there.

23:11.820 --> 23:15.022
All right, then fine.
Let the public find out.

23:15.090 --> 23:19.426
Just, please, eli,

23:19.494 --> 23:21.394
Don't let them out.

23:29.237 --> 23:33.173
For god sakes, blake,
how could you keep this from me?

23:33.241 --> 23:35.209
What'd you thinkyou were just
gonna keep running this thing

23:35.277 --> 23:37.111
Without my knowledge?

23:37.112 --> 23:39.146
Plausible deniability, sir.

23:39.214 --> 23:41.115
Oh, that's your excuse?

23:41.182 --> 23:44.218
Information regarding
the mount inostranka facility

23:44.286 --> 23:47.388
Has always been
on a needtoknow basis.

23:50.458 --> 23:54.361
I am the president
of the united states.

23:54.429 --> 23:56.397
I need to know.

24:00.468 --> 24:02.670
So this is true.

24:02.737 --> 24:04.071
This is...

24:04.072 --> 24:05.906
this is all true.

24:05.907 --> 24:07.807
Yes.
Unbelievable.

24:07.809 --> 24:10.744
So how many are there?

24:10.812 --> 24:13.347
How many prisoners?

24:13.415 --> 24:15.315
97.

24:20.221 --> 24:22.890
May i ask
how you obtained this file?

24:22.957 --> 24:24.857
No, you may not.

24:27.128 --> 24:30.264
Look, the cia has overseen
this program for many years.

24:30.332 --> 24:33.967
I can assure you,
everything's under control.

24:34.035 --> 24:35.903
There's no need for you
to be concerned.

24:35.904 --> 24:38.505
I want to go there.

24:38.573 --> 24:41.041
I want to meet them.

25:00.528 --> 25:02.896
Here it is.

25:02.964 --> 25:06.300
Welcome to mount inostranka.

25:06.368 --> 25:09.603
Detail, ten hut!

25:09.671 --> 25:11.638
Carry on!

25:11.706 --> 25:14.842
I've assembled the detainees
in the mess hall,

25:14.909 --> 25:17.478
Just as you asked.

25:17.545 --> 25:19.546
I also want to see
their living quarters

25:19.614 --> 25:21.382
And their research labs.

25:21.383 --> 25:22.416
Yes, sir.

25:22.417 --> 25:23.817
But first, you said

25:23.818 --> 25:25.753
You might want to meet
their leader.

25:51.413 --> 25:53.180
Mr. President,

25:53.181 --> 25:55.249
I'm sophia.

25:57.252 --> 25:59.686
Live from miami,

25:59.754 --> 26:01.755
Coming up following
a presidential address,

26:01.823 --> 26:05.659
Anticipated worldwide
and still shrouded in mystery,

26:05.727 --> 26:07.627
I will sit down
with president martinez

26:07.662 --> 26:09.496
For an exclusive interview.

26:09.497 --> 26:10.798
The party guests
have all left.

26:10.799 --> 26:12.266
Here's the final draft
of your speech.

26:12.267 --> 26:13.600
All right.
Thank you.

26:13.601 --> 26:14.768
Thanks.

26:14.769 --> 26:16.236
Sophia.

26:16.237 --> 26:17.938
Welcome.

26:17.939 --> 26:19.840
Thank you.

26:19.908 --> 26:21.408
So...
so...

26:21.409 --> 26:23.010
are you sure
you're ready to do this?

26:23.011 --> 26:25.512
We've been ready
for a long time.

26:25.580 --> 26:28.549
Well, your time
has come, my friend.

26:28.616 --> 26:29.817
Thank you.

26:29.818 --> 26:31.051
Rachel?
Yes, sir.

26:31.052 --> 26:32.286
Are we ready?

26:32.287 --> 26:33.854
We're just waiting
for the vice president.

26:33.855 --> 26:35.755
I need a lock
on the vice president, please.

26:35.757 --> 26:37.024
The vice president
left an hour ago.

26:37.025 --> 26:38.859
Also director sterling
left a little later.

26:38.860 --> 26:42.729
No, we need him at
the press conference right now.

26:47.302 --> 26:48.735
Code red, code red.

26:48.736 --> 26:50.636
Secure the president.

26:56.478 --> 26:58.378
We have to evacuate.

26:58.379 --> 26:59.947
What's going on?
We have to go now.

26:59.948 --> 27:02.049
She's coming with us.
Go, go!

27:02.116 --> 27:04.318
We have to go now!
Go!

27:04.385 --> 27:05.752
Ma'am, let's go!

27:05.753 --> 27:07.788
What is going on?

27:07.856 --> 27:09.289
We've lost
all radar capability.

27:09.290 --> 27:11.158
Our entire system is down!

27:11.159 --> 27:12.826
Sir, we need
to keep moving!

27:12.827 --> 27:14.228
Keep moving, keep moving!
System's down here?

27:14.229 --> 27:15.629
The entire
eastern seaboard, sir.

27:15.630 --> 27:17.097
We think the attack
is already underway.

27:17.098 --> 27:18.365
You may be the target!
Where's christina?

27:18.366 --> 27:19.733
I don't see christina.

27:19.734 --> 27:21.835
Just go to the car!
They're in the car! Go, go, go!

27:21.903 --> 27:23.270
Elias, come on!

27:23.271 --> 27:25.339
Daddy!
I'm here.

27:59.278 --> 28:02.747
Yeah, i'm sure they're just
having a good time someplace.

28:02.815 --> 28:04.715
Look, i really think
we should try to give her

28:04.717 --> 28:05.750
A little more space.

28:05.751 --> 28:07.919
You worry about her
more than i do.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.788
You're just better off
at hiding it,

28:09.789 --> 28:11.389
And then you blame it
on me.

28:11.390 --> 28:12.857
Okay, true, yes.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.893
But, look,
she's not seven anymore.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.361
What's wrong with seven?

28:16.362 --> 28:18.129
Nothing's wrong
with seven, sweetheart!

28:18.130 --> 28:20.198
...announced today

28:20.266 --> 28:22.200
That the president will address
the nation next week...

28:22.268 --> 28:24.202
okay, fine,
let's call her.

28:24.270 --> 28:25.570
See what i mean?

28:25.571 --> 28:27.906
Yes, i know
what you mean.

28:29.809 --> 28:32.177
It's my parents.

28:32.244 --> 28:35.713
Guys, i'll be right back.

28:35.781 --> 28:37.048
She is so cute.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.082
Hey, dad.

28:38.083 --> 28:39.851
Hey, sweetheart,
how's st. Lucia?

28:39.852 --> 28:42.387
You guys sound like
you're having a good time.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.022
Yeah, we're, uh,

28:44.023 --> 28:45.923
Just having some drinks
with some...

28:45.958 --> 28:47.258
new friends.

28:47.259 --> 28:48.760
Who else is there?

28:48.761 --> 28:51.629
Oh, no one, sweetie.
It's just the tv.

28:51.697 --> 28:53.932
...in an attempt
to reassure the country.

28:53.999 --> 28:55.633
So, look, uh,
we haven't heard from you

28:55.634 --> 28:57.502
In a couple of days,
so your mom and i

28:57.503 --> 28:58.770
Just wanted to check in.

28:58.771 --> 29:01.406
Tell her i said hi.
Hi, sweetie!

29:01.473 --> 29:03.508
Oh, yeah,
your mom says hi.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.310
How's sean?

29:05.311 --> 29:07.178
Sam, you left
your bike outside again.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.080
But i'm gonna
use it tomorrow.

29:09.148 --> 29:10.748
Yeah, that's
not a good enough excuse.

29:10.749 --> 29:11.850
Go grab it.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.151
Think i could call you
back tomorrow

29:13.152 --> 29:14.219
When it's not so noisy?

29:14.220 --> 29:15.854
Yeah, let's do that.

29:15.855 --> 29:18.389
I'm going to use it tomorrow!
No buts.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.357
Fine.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.193
Tell mom and sam
i said hi.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.595
I will.
Love you, pumpkin.

29:23.596 --> 29:25.496
All right,
i love you, dad. Bye.

29:28.634 --> 29:30.001
That was fast.

29:30.002 --> 29:32.103
Yeah, well, she couldn't hear
over the music,

29:32.171 --> 29:34.071
So she'll call tomorrow.

29:43.249 --> 29:45.917
So i'm just saying,

29:45.985 --> 29:49.254
I think you should start
to trust sean a little more.

29:49.321 --> 29:52.190
Yeah, what's that
supposed to mean?

29:59.064 --> 30:00.531
Aah! Aah!

30:00.532 --> 30:01.599
Aah!

30:01.600 --> 30:04.769
No, i just
he's a good kid.

30:04.837 --> 30:06.737
He's a good kid.
No, no, no, no.

30:06.739 --> 30:08.673
The way you said that,
you know something.

30:08.741 --> 30:10.408
Don't know anything.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.677
What do you know?
She's not telling me anything.

30:12.745 --> 30:15.179
Nobody's telling me.
Oh.

30:15.247 --> 30:17.147
Aah!

30:36.402 --> 30:37.669
Captain.

30:37.670 --> 30:38.703
Hi, maureen donovan.

30:38.704 --> 30:39.971
Michael buchanan.
How are you?

30:39.972 --> 30:43.241
Welcome aboard.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.376
Mike. What's up, bud?
How you doing?

30:45.444 --> 30:47.078
I thought i was flying
with davies.

30:47.079 --> 30:49.047
Yeah, i don't know
scheduling change.

30:49.114 --> 30:50.848
Well, captain,
we got clear skies

30:50.849 --> 30:53.651
All the way to sao paulo,
should be a smooth ride.

31:04.486 --> 31:05.787
What the hell's
going on?

31:05.788 --> 31:07.255
All right, look
son, who's in there?

31:07.256 --> 31:09.724
I'll explain everything
once we're on the ground,

31:09.792 --> 31:11.626
But right now,
unless you want to be used

31:11.627 --> 31:14.295
As a live bomb,
you have to get us in there!

31:14.363 --> 31:16.263
Please.

31:17.633 --> 31:18.866
Please!

31:18.867 --> 31:21.169
Okay.

31:21.237 --> 31:23.238
Okay? Thank you.
Open the door.

31:23.305 --> 31:24.939
Keep your hands
where i can see them!

31:24.940 --> 31:28.009
All right, all right.

31:28.077 --> 31:29.143
What's going on?
What's that?

31:29.144 --> 31:30.411
It gives the pilot
a few seconds

31:30.412 --> 31:32.312
To override the system
before he can lock it...

31:33.415 --> 31:35.650
which he just did.
Well, try ittry it again!

31:35.718 --> 31:36.918
No, once the override's set,

31:36.919 --> 31:38.353
You can't get in there
from out here.

31:38.354 --> 31:39.921
Damn it, mike!

31:39.922 --> 31:40.955
Look!

31:40.956 --> 31:42.824
What?

31:42.825 --> 31:43.958
Oh, my god!

31:43.959 --> 31:45.859
Oh, my god.

31:49.698 --> 31:52.300
They're gonna shoot us down.

31:52.368 --> 31:54.302
How do we get in there?
They're gonna shoot us down!

32:38.981 --> 32:41.416
Oh, i'm so glad
we decided to do this.

32:41.483 --> 32:43.383
Yeah.
Greg totally missed out.

32:43.385 --> 32:45.253
Well, snorkeling
with a cast

32:45.254 --> 32:46.888
You can't really blame him.

32:46.889 --> 32:48.489
What did he end up doing?

32:48.490 --> 32:49.757
Uh, i don't know.

32:49.758 --> 32:51.659
He went
on some jungle excursion.

32:51.727 --> 32:53.728
It sounded lame.

32:53.796 --> 32:55.596
Aw!

32:55.597 --> 32:57.565
Leila's gonna be so bummed.

32:57.633 --> 32:59.467
She would have loved this.

32:59.468 --> 33:01.202
Oh, leila.

33:01.203 --> 33:02.637
I'm sure
it's just food poisoning.

33:02.638 --> 33:04.538
She'll be better
by tomorrow, right?

33:04.540 --> 33:07.041
Uh, well, ii think
it's just that she

33:07.109 --> 33:09.544
Had a little too much
to drink last night, actually.

33:09.611 --> 33:13.915
Oh, right,
maybe it could have been that.

33:13.982 --> 33:16.117
Sorry.

33:16.185 --> 33:18.019
That's all right.

33:18.020 --> 33:19.987
At least
we had fun, right?

33:20.055 --> 33:21.489
Right?

33:21.490 --> 33:23.458
Yes.

33:23.525 --> 33:24.859
Picture.
What?

33:24.860 --> 33:27.562
Let's take a picture.
Okay.

33:50.519 --> 33:52.419
Damn it.

33:53.489 --> 33:56.157
Leila, it's me.
My card's not working.

34:01.697 --> 34:05.733
Leila?
Are you okay?

34:08.536 --> 34:10.670
Hi. Uh, i just needed
a new key.

34:10.739 --> 34:12.840
No problem.
What's the matter with the key?

34:12.908 --> 34:14.641
It just wasn't working
in the door when i

34:14.643 --> 34:15.842
When i tried it.

34:15.844 --> 34:17.411
Sometimes the magnetic strip
gets damaged.

34:17.413 --> 34:19.112
So i'll get you a new one.
Okay.

34:19.114 --> 34:20.648
What was the name again?

34:20.649 --> 34:23.251
Uh, walker, sean.

34:25.954 --> 34:28.556
Hmm, it's not coming up.
What's your room number?

34:28.623 --> 34:31.058
Uh, 5314.

34:35.464 --> 34:39.534
Actually, i have someone else
in room 5314.

34:39.601 --> 34:42.503
What
what do you mean?

34:42.571 --> 34:44.472
No, no, that'sthat's
that's my room.

34:44.540 --> 34:47.208
Could it be you're
misremembering the room number?

34:47.275 --> 34:49.342
No.

34:49.411 --> 34:52.612
No, iiit's 5314.

34:55.417 --> 34:57.051
I'm sorry.

34:57.052 --> 35:00.421
Well, what do you mean
you're sorry?

35:00.489 --> 35:02.623
Look, my girlfriend
is up there right now,

35:02.691 --> 35:04.258
And she wasn't feeling well
this morning,

35:04.259 --> 35:05.893
And now she's not even
answering the door,

35:05.894 --> 35:08.663
So could you just please
give me a new key?

35:08.730 --> 35:11.065
Sir, without knowing
your room number

35:11.133 --> 35:13.401
5314.
Mr. Walker, you're not

35:13.469 --> 35:17.071
Okay, um, can someone
just let me into my room?

35:17.139 --> 35:19.674
I'm not crazy.
I'm not on drugs.

35:19.741 --> 35:21.776
I know that my room
was 5314.

35:21.844 --> 35:24.111
There's a balcony.
We've been there for four days.

35:24.179 --> 35:25.313
It's a suite.

35:25.314 --> 35:26.881
See? There's
the flickering light,

35:26.882 --> 35:29.584
And my key doesn't work, so...

35:29.651 --> 35:31.986
no, i've already
tried knocking.

35:32.054 --> 35:33.954
My girlfriend is in there,
and she's sick.

35:33.956 --> 35:36.591
I understand, but legally,
i can't just open the door.

35:36.658 --> 35:38.659
Hi.
Sorry to bother you, sir.

35:38.727 --> 35:40.094
Ship security.

35:40.095 --> 35:41.896
Is there a problem?

35:41.897 --> 35:42.897
Who are you?

35:42.898 --> 35:44.165
I'm sorry?

35:44.166 --> 35:47.101
Hey, hey, hey!
You can't just walk in!

35:47.169 --> 35:50.037
J.B.?
What is this?
