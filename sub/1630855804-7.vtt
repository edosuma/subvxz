00:25.458 --> 00:31.250

-[eerie music playing]
-But see?

00:41.541 --> 00:43.916
She was the Messiah the whole time.

00:44.583 --> 00:48.250
And now she has the blood of Sekhmet
in her veins.

00:48.750 --> 00:52.416
All will see, and all will bow.

00:53.333 --> 00:57.875
She stands here, not only as your queen,
but as your god.

Look at you.

01:40.375 --> 01:42.208
I have some good news.

01:45.250 --> 01:48.083
I know how you can secure
the Abbot's loyalty forever.

01:50.291 --> 01:52.791
He has a daughter.

01:52.875 --> 01:53.708
Ah.

01:54.625 --> 01:55.708
A daughter.

01:56.916 --> 01:58.250

right over there.

02:44.375 --> 02:46.083
I know this is hard for you.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.583
But if I would have told you,
everything would have changed.

02:50.208 --> 02:51.666
People would have found out.

02:52.625 --> 02:54.958
You would have been the whore's daughter.

02:55.875 --> 03:00.083
I knew if he and I kept it secret,
we would keep you safe.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.916
Maria, I loved him.

03:05.416 --> 03:09.333
Perhaps if I had insisted
he stayed with us and been a father,

03:09.416 --> 03:12.708
he wouldn't have
betrayed himself like this.

03:13.875 --> 03:15.041
I don't know.

03:19.916 --> 03:21.250
I'm sorry, Maria.

Wait. You're wearing a headband.

[ethereal music playing]

05:51.916 --> 05:57.541
Behold, the one before whom evil trembles,
Devourer of Light,

05:57.625 --> 06:03.416
Taker of Souls, Vampire Lioness,
She Who Mauls, the Messiah of--

06:03.500 --> 06:05.125
Yes, charmed to meet you.

06:06.791 --> 06:08.125
You're meant to bow.

06:09.083 --> 06:10.166
Countess?

06:10.250 --> 06:12.875
Her Magnificence has heard much about you.

06:12.958 --> 06:16.541
I'm flattered.
For a god to have heard of me.

06:17.208 --> 06:20.250
A god should know
where all her dragons are.

06:20.333 --> 06:21.916
[brooding string music playing]

06:23.708 --> 06:26.208
Your voyage to Europe
has not been in vain.

06:26.750 --> 06:30.666
I've been told about the nauseating
little revolution in the New World.

06:31.500 --> 06:35.250
Watch how we will get them
to eat their own vomit here in France.

06:35.750 --> 06:39.333
Then you will see how to deal
with your American upstarts.

06:40.666 --> 06:42.541
[blood squelches]

06:43.291 --> 06:44.416
[hisses contentedly]

06:45.666 --> 06:47.375
The time for compromise is over.

06:48.416 --> 06:51.041
We will not only extinguish
their dissent…

06:51.125 --> 06:52.416
But start an empire.

06:53.000 --> 06:53.916
Exactly.

06:54.916 --> 06:58.625
And once they see my beauty,
all will worship me.

06:59.208 --> 07:02.791
Forgive me, but you want to
accomplish this through an alliance

07:02.875 --> 07:04.791
with a man who will never worship you?

07:04.875 --> 07:06.125
I'm a goddess.

07:06.625 --> 07:08.000
[dramatic music playing]

07:08.083 --> 07:10.041
[crackling, humming]

07:10.125 --> 07:11.083
Of course.

07:12.250 --> 07:13.333
Bow, I said.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.291
I will make the Abbot worship me.

07:18.916 --> 07:21.166
Everyone has a weakness.

07:21.791 --> 07:23.041
Priests.

07:23.125 --> 07:24.375
Dragons.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.000
Yes.

07:33.458 --> 07:34.375
[blood squelching]

07:35.958 --> 07:39.958
Once she conquers Europe,
you will be her guide into America.

07:40.666 --> 07:41.666
[hisses]

07:42.291 --> 07:44.125
And you will deliver it to me.

07:44.666 --> 07:45.750
Your Messiah.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.375
I told you to bow.

-[music fades]
-[crickets chirping]

08:12.166 --> 08:13.958
I should have told you about Juste.

08:14.041 --> 08:15.875
It's all right. I understand.

08:17.625 --> 08:19.083
He was kind of--

08:19.166 --> 08:21.500
Wounded? Withdrawn?

08:21.583 --> 08:23.250
Bit of a dick.

08:23.333 --> 08:25.083
Oh, yeah. Yes.

08:32.291 --> 08:33.750
Annette, look.

08:38.875 --> 08:40.750
Oh. You're back, are you?

08:45.708 --> 08:46.750
Ah, shit.

08:50.708 --> 08:52.375
[footsteps approaching]

09:01.000 --> 09:02.208
Those were Edouard's?

09:04.583 --> 09:05.458
Uh…

09:06.833 --> 09:08.250
Look, about everything…

09:09.000 --> 09:13.958
[inhales] I just want to, uh, apologize
personally to you and swear I'll--

09:14.041 --> 09:15.291
I knew you'd be back.

09:16.250 --> 09:18.666
I was more concerned than I wanted to be.

09:19.333 --> 09:20.208
Oh.

09:20.708 --> 09:21.708
The muscles, huh?

09:21.791 --> 09:22.666
[chuckles softly]

09:24.666 --> 09:26.208
There's so few of us left.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.708
[gentle music playing]

09:32.041 --> 09:34.708
We're going to get Edouard out.

09:34.791 --> 09:36.500
[whooshes]

09:36.583 --> 09:37.500
Ooh.

09:38.125 --> 09:39.416
How did that happen?

09:39.500 --> 09:42.583
A bunch of vampires tracked me,
hunted me down.

09:43.708 --> 09:44.750
I don't know.

09:45.375 --> 09:48.208
I was helpless, like I was a child again.

09:48.291 --> 09:49.875
But we're not children anymore.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.708
No.

09:51.791 --> 09:55.166
[inhales] When I had nothing to hold onto,
and everything was gone,

09:56.208 --> 09:58.500
I remembered the things
that make me who I am.

09:59.541 --> 10:02.791
The hopes, the pain, and the shit.

10:04.083 --> 10:05.750
The love in this house.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.958
And, I suppose for the first time,
I really made a choice

10:10.041 --> 10:12.041
about the kind of person I want to be.

10:12.625 --> 10:13.625
A Belmont.

10:14.750 --> 10:17.250
I left all six of them in a pile of ashes.

10:18.625 --> 10:21.291
I won't let myself be afraid ever again.

10:22.916 --> 10:24.041
But we are afraid.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.625
It's not always bad.

10:27.708 --> 10:29.708
It just means we have something to lose.

10:36.416 --> 10:38.583
I suppose we'll be needing
a new plan, then.

10:51.375 --> 10:53.708
Does he use all the mouths to eat?

10:55.750 --> 10:56.583
No.

10:57.416 --> 11:01.083
We're concerned you still have limitations
on the number you can make.

11:01.708 --> 11:03.958
Soon, we'll have
many more corpses for you.

11:04.041 --> 11:06.166
Be assured you'll have enough.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.083
If I may, Countess.

11:09.166 --> 11:11.125
I've been thinking our first move

11:11.208 --> 11:13.416
should be on the city of Nantes.

11:13.916 --> 11:16.541
With that revolutionary stronghold gone,

11:16.625 --> 11:18.625
we'll have a fortified position

11:18.708 --> 11:20.041
from which to take Rennes.

11:20.708 --> 11:24.208
And then, of course, onto Paris.

11:26.583 --> 11:28.500
Before we make any plans,

11:28.583 --> 11:30.875
Her Magnificence needs to know
she can trust you.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.541
He's a man of God.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.625
-I am a god.

to prove your love for me?

11:50.458 --> 11:52.041
[eerie music playing]

11:52.125 --> 11:53.833
What do you want?

11:54.333 --> 11:55.333
Submission.

11:55.833 --> 11:58.000
What do you mean, "submission"?

11:58.083 --> 11:59.291
Submission.

12:01.166 --> 12:04.625
Tomorrow, the Vampire Messiah
will come to the house of your God

12:04.708 --> 12:06.208
to seal the alliance.

12:06.791 --> 12:07.666
In blood.

12:08.416 --> 12:09.916
A sacrifice?

12:10.458 --> 12:11.791
[Drolta happily] Hmm.

12:12.458 --> 12:14.125
Someone you love.

12:14.958 --> 12:17.708
Your daughter, perhaps?

12:18.500 --> 12:21.583
That would seal our union, wouldn't it?

12:21.666 --> 12:24.625
A daughter? The Abbot has no daughter.

12:27.041 --> 12:28.000
[gasps]

12:28.791 --> 12:32.666
Men, led by their balls.

12:32.750 --> 12:36.416
And now I have yours in my hand.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.833
How did you…

12:37.916 --> 12:39.875
[Drolta] Prove your loyalty, Abbot.

12:39.958 --> 12:41.958
What was she called again?

12:42.041 --> 12:43.500
Maria.

12:44.166 --> 12:47.166
[eerie music rising]

12:47.250 --> 12:48.333
[music peaks, fades]

12:51.583 --> 12:54.375
[Annette] We should assume
we can't use the tunnels now.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.708
I suggest two of us
attack the Abbey head-on.

12:57.791 --> 12:59.208
Create a distraction.

12:59.291 --> 13:00.583
Mm. Easy.

13:00.666 --> 13:05.208
Maria, you and I go over the west wall
and through the orchard.

13:05.291 --> 13:08.041
Can you use your birds
to fly us up to the tower window?

13:09.416 --> 13:11.541
From there, we can work our way down.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.583
We attack from both inside and outside
at the same time.

13:14.666 --> 13:17.291
We will separate them out
by attacking at daybreak.

13:17.375 --> 13:21.208
The vampires will be at the Château.
Only night creatures will be at the Abbey.

13:21.291 --> 13:23.625
We will have the advantage
of sunlight and distance.

13:23.708 --> 13:26.583
What will happen to… my father?

13:27.375 --> 13:29.250
[somber music playing]

13:30.333 --> 13:31.541
He's made his choice.

13:32.916 --> 13:36.750
My only question is how he's turning
those bodies into night creatures.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.916
A Forgemaster usually has
a talisman or tool.

13:41.583 --> 13:42.583
We need to find it.

Maria, take the garden.
I'll take the back.

Why won't you face me?

14:57.041 --> 14:59.875
[Olrox] Just make sure
you destroy the machine.

14:59.958 --> 15:00.875
You do it!

15:00.958 --> 15:04.375
Right now,
I can't be seen to be doing anything.

15:04.958 --> 15:09.708
Besides, there's a need for a human hand
in the business of forgemastery.

15:10.708 --> 15:12.958
This is why Erzsebet needs the Abbot.

15:13.041 --> 15:14.375
And why you need us!

15:20.375 --> 15:21.333
[whip cracks]

15:22.625 --> 15:26.000
You expect me to trust my mother's killer?

15:26.708 --> 15:29.125
[Olrox] I could have killed you
three times now.

15:30.041 --> 15:35.541
Ironic, I think, for both of us,
that now I need a Belmont.

15:36.666 --> 15:41.208
If you want to defeat Erzsebet,
you've no choice but to trust me.

15:41.791 --> 15:43.375
There is always a choice.

15:47.166 --> 15:48.625
-[Maria panting]
-[cat snarls]

15:48.708 --> 15:50.250
[suspenseful music playing]

15:53.125 --> 15:54.666
Just read the fucking book.

16:02.458 --> 16:03.958
[Tera] He was telling the truth.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.708
This is some sort of a guide
for the machine.

16:07.708 --> 16:11.916
There are spells in here,
instructions the Abbot has been using.

16:12.625 --> 16:16.000
If I can decode it, maybe I can find out
how to destroy the machine.

16:16.083 --> 16:17.166
Spells?

16:17.750 --> 16:20.541
See here? It's written in Enochian.

16:21.708 --> 16:23.041
The language of hell.

16:25.541 --> 16:27.541
[sinister music playing]

16:30.708 --> 16:32.708
[vampires whispering indistinctly]

16:44.791 --> 16:46.666
[eerie music playing]

17:09.583 --> 17:11.208
[whooshing]

17:11.291 --> 17:13.750
[crackling]

17:13.833 --> 17:15.833
[dramatic music playing]

17:34.000 --> 17:35.166
[music fades]

17:37.666 --> 17:39.666
[gentle music playing]

17:48.666 --> 17:51.083
[Abbot] To you, O Lord, I call.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.791
Hear the voice of my supplications,
when I cry unto thee.

17:57.375 --> 18:01.125
And hide not thy face from thy servant.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.083
For I am in trouble.

18:07.625 --> 18:12.000
Hear me speedily,
when I raise my hands to thy holy oracle.

18:14.750 --> 18:18.833
Lift up thy feet
unto the perpetual desolations.

18:19.791 --> 18:23.458
They have defiled
the dwelling place of thy name.

18:25.750 --> 18:28.083
Rise up, O God,

18:28.166 --> 18:30.708
-and defend your cause.
-[Maria whimpers]

18:30.791 --> 18:31.750
[snoring]

18:31.833 --> 18:34.375
[Abbot] Though my steps
have well-nigh slipped.

18:34.458 --> 18:35.500
[exhales]

18:36.166 --> 18:39.666
O Lord, do not be silent.

18:40.833 --> 18:41.666
[Maria] Father.

18:49.875 --> 18:52.375
-[night creatures growling]
-I'm here to warn you.

18:53.375 --> 18:56.833
There's going to be an attack.
You need to get out of here.

18:56.916 --> 18:58.333
I don't want you to die.

18:59.166 --> 19:01.541
I am safe in the House of God.

19:02.125 --> 19:03.541
House of God?

19:04.333 --> 19:07.000
This place is just a heap
of bricks and stone.

19:07.083 --> 19:10.583
The Church is more than that, child.

19:10.666 --> 19:15.250
Without it,
society loses its soul, its meaning.

19:15.333 --> 19:20.041
It is the structure through which
morality itself is upheld.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.958
The Church only upholds itself.

19:22.541 --> 19:25.833
A power-hungry den of thieves
spreading intolerance and hypocrisy.

19:25.916 --> 19:28.833
Happy to live on the backs of the poor
in their extravagant buildings,

19:28.916 --> 19:30.583
rather than take on injustice.

19:30.666 --> 19:34.958
But without God,
there's no justice of any kind.

19:35.041 --> 19:38.583
No matter how complicated you make it,
evil is still evil.

19:38.666 --> 19:41.875
Everything you're doing is built
on the blood of innocent people.

19:41.958 --> 19:43.625
[ominous music playing]

19:43.708 --> 19:46.000
Sometimes blood is the only way.

19:48.125 --> 19:51.541
If you ever cared about me,
you should leave with me now.

19:52.750 --> 19:53.708
And maybe…

19:54.916 --> 19:56.416
maybe you can be my father.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.583
[gentle music playing]

20:01.000 --> 20:02.708
I'm not going without you, old man.

20:05.916 --> 20:08.833
Sweet, sweet Maria.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.125
God has truly sent you.

20:12.208 --> 20:13.750
[ominous music playing]

20:13.833 --> 20:18.458
Your sacrifice here
will send your soul to heaven.

20:18.541 --> 20:20.833
[eerie music rising]

20:20.916 --> 20:22.125
Seize her.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.500
[screams]

20:24.583 --> 20:25.500
[strains]

20:25.583 --> 20:27.500
[eerie music rising]

20:29.750 --> 20:31.041
[music peaks, fades]

20:33.166 --> 20:34.791
[stylus scratching on paper]

20:34.875 --> 20:35.958
[birds chirping]

20:37.750 --> 20:38.916
[sighs]

20:39.000 --> 20:40.250
We've got them!

20:41.125 --> 20:42.000
We've got them!

20:43.416 --> 20:44.250
What is it?

20:44.750 --> 20:47.083
The machine cannot be destroyed.

20:47.166 --> 20:51.458
It has been made in hell,
forged by a powerful, powerful evil.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.625
[exhales] And you're partying because?

20:53.708 --> 20:56.208
[Tera] Because even though
we can't destroy the machine,

20:56.291 --> 20:57.875
it can be sent back to hell.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.708
This book will enable me
to create a portal.

21:00.791 --> 21:02.541
And then we just need you, Annette,

21:02.625 --> 21:05.000
to use your powers
to push the machine through it.

21:05.500 --> 21:08.541
So, we need to open a door to hell
to save everyone.

21:09.125 --> 21:10.125
Right.

21:10.208 --> 21:11.750
What could possibly go wrong?

21:11.833 --> 21:12.875
[pounding at door]

21:12.958 --> 21:15.458
[ominous music plays]

21:20.458 --> 21:21.666
[panting]

21:21.750 --> 21:23.166
The Abbot has Maria.

21:24.125 --> 21:26.208
He's going to sacrifice her to Erzsebet.

21:26.291 --> 21:27.583
[eerie music playing]

21:27.666 --> 21:29.708
[power whooshing, crackling]

21:41.000 --> 21:42.500
[eerie music continues]

21:44.083 --> 21:46.083
[dramatic music playing]

22:08.291 --> 22:12.500
Behold, the Devourer of Light!

22:12.583 --> 22:14.583
[vampires gasping, murmuring excitedly]

22:18.875 --> 22:19.833
Impossible.

22:24.166 --> 22:25.000
[gasps]

22:29.000 --> 22:32.666
[laughs triumphantly]

22:34.750 --> 22:36.416
[music intensifies]

23:02.541 --> 23:03.416
[music fades]

23:03.500 --> 23:05.708
[disorienting music playing]

23:05.791 --> 23:07.750
-[cawing]
-[tree creaking]

23:15.250 --> 23:16.250
[panting]

23:16.333 --> 23:17.916
-[crows cawing]
-[gasps]

23:18.000 --> 23:20.083

23:20.833 --> 23:23.041

23:25.916 --> 23:27.708

23:41.208 --> 23:43.208
[music swelling]
