WEBVTT

02:56.218 --> 02:58.755
Sergeant Billings. Sir.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.676
I found something.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.510
That's a shell casing from a rifle.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.092
Keep looking for Stansbury.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.683
You heard me. Do it.

03:28.959 --> 03:30.665
Let's go.

03:43.974 --> 03:47.011
Wonder where they
put the batteries in this thing?

03:50.397 --> 03:53.230
I also hear it makes a hell of a milkshake.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.407
What's going on with you?

04:08.123 --> 04:10.830
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

04:10.917 --> 04:14.080
You've been jumping out
of your skin all morning.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.671
And these last few weeks,

04:19.760 --> 04:21.591
I don't know where you are.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.637
What's happening?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.056
Talk to me.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.355
Babe,

04:37.068 --> 04:38.808
please.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.442
There's been an...

04:50.332 --> 04:52.243
an incident.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.876
And it's...

04:58.131 --> 04:59.996
It's bad.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.843
It's real bad.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.553
And I'm gonna have to...

05:16.024 --> 05:18.857
I'm gonna have to make a choice.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.236
Make a choice? What are you talking about?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.405
Between me or her.

05:27.536 --> 05:29.197
Sarah?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.286
What did you do, Stephen?

05:40.423 --> 05:42.584
I'm gonna mess up our kid.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.669
I'm just a piece of shit like my dad.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.387
No, you're not.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.306
You're not.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.929
You say that, but...

06:01.069 --> 06:03.651
You don't know what you're
talking about because...

06:05.907 --> 06:07.818
you don't know what I did.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.870
Whatever happened...

06:19.671 --> 06:21.536
doesn't matter.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.464
Not now.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.922
We're having a child.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.890
There's nothing more to say.

06:43.361 --> 06:46.569
Hey, guys. How are we doing today?

06:46.656 --> 06:47.987
Good, great.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.608
- How's your pH balance?
- Uh, it's a siX.

06:52.203 --> 06:55.912
- Ready to meet your baby?
- Absolutely, yeah.

06:55.999 --> 06:58.035
We're excited. Right, babe?

06:58.126 --> 06:59.662
Yeah.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.202
This is the best part.

07:02.297 --> 07:05.130
I mean, besides actually having your baby.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.502
You're gonna get a real kick out of it.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.304
Let's take a listen first.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.814
What is that?

07:24.569 --> 07:27.106
Your little girl's heartbeat.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.189
It's a girl?

07:31.242 --> 07:33.654
Congratulations, you two.

07:43.755 --> 07:47.623
Come on, Holder, you dumb prick.

07:55.558 --> 07:56.593
Detective?

07:56.685 --> 07:59.392
Deputy Commissioner Brandt's
ready to see you now.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.186
Okay.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.428
Detective Linden.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.955
Let me in. Let me in. Let me in.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.630
- What happened?
- They tried to kill me.

09:14.763 --> 09:17.755
They were chasing me and
then... and they shot at me.

09:17.849 --> 09:19.339
- Who shot at you?
- They shot at me.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.053
AJ and Lincoln. In the woods.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.601
They told me to kill her.
They wanted me to kill her.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.183
- Kill who?
- My mom. They're crazy.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.105
They kept screaming, "Kill, kill, kill."

09:28.193 --> 09:32.232
Okay, Kyle, I need you to breathe.
I need you to calm down and breathe.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.401
They put that gun in my room.

09:35.492 --> 09:38.905
They knew where all the
bodies were on the floor.

09:38.995 --> 09:43.455
And then she had the gun.
Colonel Rayne had the gun.

09:43.750 --> 09:47.288
They all did it together.
They did it together. Oh, God.

09:47.378 --> 09:51.371
I don't wanna remember it. I don't wanna
remember it. I don't wanna remember it.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.081
It's okay. You don't have to.

09:53.176 --> 09:56.464
You don't have to. You're
okay. You're gonna be okay.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.888
Nobody's gonna hurt you. I promise.

10:01.392 --> 10:04.179
Nobody's gonna hurt you. You're okay.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.135
- You're okay.
- I wanna go home.

10:06.231 --> 10:09.314
I know. I know.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.391
Shh.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.661
I want that search
warrant issued right now.

10:24.124 --> 10:28.242
Call me as soon as you get it from the
judge or I'm going to the DA myself.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.103
Are you going?

10:57.198 --> 10:59.985
Ijust have to go out for a little while.

11:04.038 --> 11:07.530
You're safe here on the island.
Nobody knows you're here.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.467
It's so green.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.344
It's like it's not even real.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.436
Like what Eden must have been like.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.446
And that's the Tree of Life.

11:55.506 --> 11:58.464
No one is going to find you here, Kyle.

12:02.013 --> 12:06.507
Is that why you're here?
So no one will find you?

12:13.942 --> 12:16.354
You should get some sleep.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.412
Linden.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.831
Yeah. I'm heading out now.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.427
I can't find Knopf,
Fielding or Stansbury anywhere, ma'am.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.220
I checked the barracks
again and all the classrooms.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.888
- Keep looking.
- They probably left campus, ma'am.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.058
I don't wanna see your
face again until you find them.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.393
Am I making myself clear, cadet?

13:03.116 --> 13:05.277
Where were you?

13:06.369 --> 13:08.234
What were you doing?

13:09.497 --> 13:10.486
Answer me!

13:10.915 --> 13:12.576
He knows.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.291
Everything. He remembers everything.

13:15.378 --> 13:18.120
- That's not possible.
- We tested him.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.125
We tried to see if he'd
remember and he did.

13:21.259 --> 13:22.715
Lincoln was right all along.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.884
It was just a matter of
time before he remembered.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.053
We should've killed him as
soon as he came back here.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.758
You need to watch your tone
with me, Cadet Fielding.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.343
- Fuck that cadet bullshit.
- Don't talk to her like that.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.224
Why are you defending her?

13:35.315 --> 13:36.896
She doesn't care about us.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.024
She never did.

13:40.611 --> 13:44.274
She knew Kyle would remember
and didn't give a fuck.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.491
I say we do her.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.989
Right here.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.529
Right now.

13:55.626 --> 13:58.003
Let's blow the bitch away.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.351
What did you do to Kyle?

14:16.272 --> 14:17.512
Answer me!

14:17.607 --> 14:20.644
You said if I trusted you
everything would be okay.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.020
But it's not.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.612
None of this is okay.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.942
How dare you talk to me about trust?

14:27.033 --> 14:30.241
You stole my vehicle to go to that house.

14:30.328 --> 14:31.818
You took a weapon there.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.498
And then, when it was all over,

14:34.832 --> 14:38.120
you came to me to fix what you did.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.202
You said we were a family.

14:41.005 --> 14:44.088
But you're a liar. You just
lied. You only care about him.

14:44.175 --> 14:46.837
I fixed it all for all of
you. What more do you want?

14:46.928 --> 14:49.544
- You'd have gone to prison ifI hadn't.
- Bullshit!

14:49.639 --> 14:51.300
It was all bullshit!

14:53.518 --> 14:56.806
You used me. You didn't care about
me. All you cared about was him.

14:56.896 --> 15:01.390
Now you fucking tell me why.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.188
No.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.987
I will do no such thing.

15:10.326 --> 15:13.068
Who do you think you're talking to?

15:16.582 --> 15:18.959
Now you tell me

15:19.043 --> 15:20.999
what you did

15:21.087 --> 15:22.952
to Cadet Stansbury.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.087
Nothing.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.136
He got away.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.180
You're glad?

15:38.813 --> 15:41.976
He's going to the cops, and
he's gonna tell them everything.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.811
We're going to prison!

15:43.901 --> 15:47.064
Not if we stick to the plan.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.358
Fuck you.

15:49.574 --> 15:52.065
And fuck your plan.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.991
AJ, let's get out of here.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.243
Where are you going?

16:04.464 --> 16:06.455
Don't you walk away from me!

16:08.092 --> 16:10.299
- You're not permitted entry...
- Get out of our way.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.751
Get out of the way.

16:12.889 --> 16:13.969
- Shots fired.
- Move, move.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.222
Upstairs.

16:25.193 --> 16:28.401
- Where'd the shots come from?
- Get out of here!

16:29.447 --> 16:30.903
- Ready?
- Yeah.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.823
- Police!
- Police! Drop your weapon!

16:33.951 --> 16:35.816
- Drop your weapon!
- Get on the ground!

16:35.912 --> 16:38.779
- Stand down!
- Check them.

16:38.873 --> 16:42.115
- They're gone.
- Jesus Christ.

16:42.460 --> 16:45.418
Stand down! Stand down! Back off!

16:46.255 --> 16:47.995
Drop your weapon, Margaret.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.796
Put the gun down, Margaret.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.920
Put the gun down, Margaret.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.467
Holder,

16:53.554 --> 16:55.169
I got this.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.428
I killed the Stansburys.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.520
You have to arrest me.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.846
Why shoot them if you're
so willing to confess?

17:05.942 --> 17:08.558
Your alibi checked out, we
have the tapes from the hotel.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.393
You were never in that house that night.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.479
- Why are you lying?
- I'm not lying.

17:12.573 --> 17:13.813
I'm confessing.

17:13.908 --> 17:15.239
I'm a soldier.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.408
I know how to accept the
consequences of my actions.

17:17.495 --> 17:19.986
That's how things work in my world.

17:21.332 --> 17:23.414
Who are you protecting?

17:35.388 --> 17:36.878
You've been protecting
him from the beginning.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.009
You cleaned up the car.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.220
You did everything in your
power to keep us away from him.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.650
Put the gun down, Margaret.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.439
Philip didn't give
Kyle those soldiers, you did.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.659
Seventeen little soldiers,

18:00.705 --> 18:03.321
one for each of Kyle's birthdays.

18:05.376 --> 18:08.914
Seventeen years ago, you lost a
child. It was your greatest loss.

18:15.970 --> 18:18.586
The baby didn't die, did he?

18:22.018 --> 18:24.009
It wasn't Philip that you
were following all those years.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.594
It wasn't him you wanted to see
when you sat outside that house,

18:26.689 --> 18:28.475
when you went on all those trips.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.307
It was Kyle.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.819
Because he's your son.

18:40.578 --> 18:43.741
Don't tell him, please.

18:45.750 --> 18:48.116
He'll think that I didn't want him.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.331
He'll never understand.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.585
I'm just not built that way.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.381
To love a child

18:59.930 --> 19:04.640
makes you open to all
the hurt in the world.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.430
Philip just...

19:07.521 --> 19:09.682
He never loved Kyle.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.190
I know that now.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.945
Why didn't I see it?

19:19.325 --> 19:21.407
Why didn't I see it?

19:21.952 --> 19:23.362
Just”.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.994
for years...

19:26.248 --> 19:28.159
I watched him.

19:29.335 --> 19:33.044
And there was always this sadness.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.205
You should've seen it.

19:37.802 --> 19:39.884
But he came back to you.

19:39.970 --> 19:44.179
I thought he died, that night.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.134
But he lived.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.054
My son lived.

19:54.151 --> 19:57.109
And I had a second chance
to know him and he's...

19:57.905 --> 20:00.191
And he's been hurt.

20:06.038 --> 20:10.122
So you have to arrest me.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.372
I'm the one who left.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.044
I'm the one to blame. Not him.

20:16.132 --> 20:19.044
It's me. I'm his mother.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.212
I know what it's like to walk away.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.387
How hard it is to stay.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.562
I know.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.976
Put down your weapon.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.964
You have the right to remain silent.

21:08.350 --> 21:12.138
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.644
You have the right to an attorney.

21:15.316 --> 21:19.901
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.150
Do understand these rights?

22:11.580 --> 22:13.286
Hey, Linden.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.456
Linden.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.123
Let's go pick up Kyle.

22:24.969 --> 22:26.925
She confessed.

22:28.931 --> 22:31.138
So? She lied.

22:33.435 --> 22:38.850
I'm arresting her for the
murder of Philip, Linda,

22:38.941 --> 22:41.683
Phoebe and Nadine Stansbury.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.104
No, you're not.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.653
You're arresting her for those two
kids that are lying dead in her office.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.150
That's it.

22:51.245 --> 22:53.827
She didn't kill the Stansburys.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.948
Don't you touch him.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.318
You took that shell casing.

23:28.282 --> 23:29.772
What?

23:30.826 --> 23:33.158
It was never missing. You took it.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.950
It was your insurance in
case they ever found out.

23:37.041 --> 23:39.077
You'd have proof that I did it.

23:42.838 --> 23:46.751
You and Reddick were talking. I saw you.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.468
I sh... I should...

23:51.847 --> 23:55.010
I should have known you'd leave me too.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.538
Clear!

25:43.625 --> 25:45.081
Clear!

25:45.335 --> 25:46.620
Clear!

25:50.507 --> 25:52.338
Clear!

26:35.260 --> 26:37.546
The back door doesn't lock.

26:41.308 --> 26:43.594
That's how we got in that night.

26:44.478 --> 26:46.264
You're not well. You don't
know what you're saying.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.013
I remembered.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.977
In your house...

26:55.656 --> 26:57.021
I remembered everything.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.823
You shouldn't be here.
Please. We should go.

26:59.910 --> 27:01.616
But this is home.

27:01.662 --> 27:05.325
The place you're supposed
to be safe, loved.

27:06.208 --> 27:08.540
My dad hated me.

27:09.086 --> 27:11.418
I saw it in his eyes every day of my life.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.455
And my mother, I didn't exist to her.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.211
Not to anyone.

27:19.221 --> 27:20.552
Maybe it's me.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.504
Maybe something's broken in me.

27:22.599 --> 27:25.636
Maybe something's broken
in me and everyone knows it.

27:25.811 --> 27:28.097
They hated me.

27:28.438 --> 27:31.521
My family, my school,

27:31.608 --> 27:33.940
everywhere I went, everyone hated me.

27:34.027 --> 27:37.940
- You stop it, Kyle.
- They had no idea what real hate was.

27:38.031 --> 27:40.238
You wanna be a soldier? You wanna be a man?

27:40.325 --> 27:43.362
You have to learn to kill the things
you love, you weak piece of fucking shit.

27:43.453 --> 27:46.786
- Now fucking do it. Kill, kill, kill.
- Fucking kill her!

27:46.874 --> 27:49.411
- Kill. Kill. Kill.
- Kill. Ki||. Ki||.

27:49.459 --> 27:51.370
Ki||. Ki||. Ki||.

28:06.435 --> 28:08.596
You wanna do it?

28:11.523 --> 28:13.388
Let's do it.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.941
Let's kill somebody.

28:26.246 --> 28:28.737
I was gonna show
them what real hate was.

28:28.832 --> 28:32.199
Sometimes we do wrong
things to make it right.

28:32.294 --> 28:35.127
And the world doesn't understand,
because how could they?

28:35.214 --> 28:39.048
There are times when you have
to make impossible choices.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.089
You believe that?

28:47.768 --> 28:50.225
I wanted to die.

28:50.312 --> 28:52.598
I should have that night.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.479
There weren't any bullets
left in Lincoln's gun,

28:54.524 --> 28:56.185
so I went and got my dad's gun.

28:58.570 --> 29:02.108
You wanted to die, but a part
of you wanted to live too.

29:02.616 --> 29:04.197
Please.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.820
Kyle, you don't have
much time, we have to go.

29:06.912 --> 29:11.121
It hurts. It
hurts so much that I need...

29:11.541 --> 29:12.792
What?

29:12.876 --> 29:15.288
I don't know. I don't
know. I don't know what I...

29:15.379 --> 29:18.462
Anything, just tell me, I'll help you.

29:18.548 --> 29:19.879
Just tell me what you need.

29:19.967 --> 29:22.424
To find a way out.

29:23.804 --> 29:25.795
Help me.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.108
Then tell me.

29:42.155 --> 29:43.531
Tell me what you did.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.026
And then it'll be okay.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.808
Turn the light off,
man. She's gonna see us.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.817
She's gonna fucking see us.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.031
- Kyle?
- What the hell is going on?

30:25.115 --> 30:27.231
What do you think you're
doing in here? Get out!

30:27.326 --> 30:29.112
Oh, my God!

30:31.413 --> 30:33.825
Oh, God! No!

30:35.834 --> 30:37.370
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.328
Get the fuck out and go!

30:43.925 --> 30:46.917
No! No!

30:47.012 --> 30:48.252
No!

30:51.600 --> 30:56.344
Oh! No! Stop! Don't!

31:07.991 --> 31:10.653
No! No!

31:11.828 --> 31:14.035
No, please!

31:25.759 --> 31:29.251
I went from room to
room until they were silent.

31:29.346 --> 31:32.759
And I was finally alone.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.020
But I wasn't alone.

32:14.933 --> 32:18.141
Did the monster go away?

32:28.572 --> 32:31.359
Close your eyes, baby bird.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.699
Close your eyes, please.

32:37.414 --> 32:39.496
I promise it won't hurt.

33:00.854 --> 33:02.594
I'm sorry, baby bird.

33:02.689 --> 33:05.101
I'm sorry, baby bird.

33:05.192 --> 33:07.683
I'm sorry.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.855
I'm sorry.

33:11.239 --> 33:12.945
Why?

33:14.284 --> 33:16.240
Her eyes.

33:18.246 --> 33:22.455
I couldn't stand to see it in her eyes.

33:24.169 --> 33:26.000
See what?

33:26.338 --> 33:29.546
That I was the monster.

33:30.884 --> 33:33.000
That it was me.

35:10.692 --> 35:13.149
I killed James Skinner.

35:16.406 --> 35:18.488
I shot him twice.

35:19.659 --> 35:22.901
I put him in the car and
drove it into the lake.

35:23.913 --> 35:26.245
Holder had nothing to do with it.

35:28.627 --> 35:29.912
Hm.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.579
I offered him a deal.

35:35.216 --> 35:39.255
With the baby coming, I
figured he'd be the weak link.

35:40.221 --> 35:42.428
I knew you wouldn't be.

35:42.515 --> 35:44.255
Not you, Sarah.

35:48.104 --> 35:51.267
He told me to go fuck
myself in the rear end.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.451
I'm waiving my rights.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.908
I don't want an attorney.

36:07.957 --> 36:10.494
Everything I've said
is admissible in court.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.826
I'll sign anything you want.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.253
You can arrest me now.

36:28.978 --> 36:30.013
Deputy Commissioner.

36:30.105 --> 36:32.642
Stay seated, Detective Linden.

36:39.406 --> 36:43.194
Sarah, it's been a while.

36:43.284 --> 36:45.070
How's your son?

36:45.161 --> 36:46.537
Jack, right?

36:47.580 --> 36:50.322
Uh, he's in high school
now, from what I recall.

36:50.417 --> 36:51.998
What is this?

36:54.212 --> 36:57.204
John tells me there's a rumor going around

36:57.298 --> 36:59.254
about a Lieutenant Skinner.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.552
According to this rumor

37:04.889 --> 37:09.258
he was the so-called Pied
Piper serial murderer.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.511
Yes. He killed those girls.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.688
It isn't a rumor, it's true.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.850
So I shot him.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.817
I killed him.

37:20.238 --> 37:24.402
I think you've made a mistake, Detective.

37:25.618 --> 37:28.234
The coroner's official report.

37:28.830 --> 37:30.741
Lieutenant Skinner's cause of death

37:30.832 --> 37:34.290
was a self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the head.

37:34.377 --> 37:35.992
It was ruled a suicide.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.465
I'm sorry for your loss.

37:40.800 --> 37:46.090
You had a personal relationship with
Lt. Skinner, from what I understand.

37:48.767 --> 37:52.100
Add that to the stress of this last case,

37:52.187 --> 37:55.145
and I can understand how his
suicide must have been quite a blow.

37:55.482 --> 37:58.315
He didn't kill himself and you know it.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.896
You...

38:01.696 --> 38:04.028
put me in this chair.

38:06.284 --> 38:11.824
I would gladly lock you up for
the rest of your fucking days.

38:15.126 --> 38:20.041
But imagine the public response
if a cop, a high-ranking detective,

38:20.089 --> 38:22.341
was the killer of young children.

38:22.425 --> 38:24.632
The damage would be irreparable.

38:24.761 --> 38:26.626
To whom?

38:27.263 --> 38:30.801
- You?
- Joe Mills killed those girls.

38:30.892 --> 38:32.678
Joe Mills didn't kill those girls.

38:32.852 --> 38:34.558
Skinner confessed.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.853
You have this on tape?

38:38.107 --> 38:41.520
What evidence do you have, Detective?

38:50.078 --> 38:55.163
I will go to the press.

38:56.876 --> 38:58.912
You have a history...

38:59.879 --> 39:02.666
of mental illness, Sarah.

39:07.762 --> 39:10.128
It was nice seeing you.

39:27.907 --> 39:30.944
Always the one with the conscience.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.292
Sometimes that's not enough.

42:28.421 --> 42:30.207
I thought you should have this.

42:31.340 --> 42:33.251
It's your daughter's.

42:47.356 --> 42:51.474
I shouldn't have said those things to you.

42:53.279 --> 42:55.235
I'm sorry.

42:55.323 --> 42:57.029
You had no right talking to me that way.

42:57.116 --> 42:58.617
I know.

43:01.412 --> 43:02.948
I know.

43:14.675 --> 43:17.052
I'm gonna be a dad.

43:21.641 --> 43:23.347
I'm gonna have a little girl.

43:28.648 --> 43:33.642
Ijust don't wanna fuck it
up, you know, being a dad.

43:35.404 --> 43:37.144
Then don't.

43:47.875 --> 43:51.993
So where's your partner?
Sarah is her name, right?

43:53.297 --> 43:57.757
- Still working together?
- I gotta go.

44:23.369 --> 44:25.325
What's up, little bee?

48:19.480 --> 48:22.688
I want strawberry and
lemonade cupcakes, Daddy.

48:22.775 --> 48:26.484
But Parker can only have one
because it's my birthday, not hers.

48:26.570 --> 48:29.277
That's right, little lady, it's
your birthday party, not hers.

48:29.365 --> 48:30.946
Don't you worry, I got your back.

48:31.033 --> 48:33.024
No vegan cupcakes, Daddy.

48:33.119 --> 48:34.700
They taste like caca.

48:37.456 --> 48:40.493
No. There's no vegan
caca in sight, I swear.

48:40.584 --> 48:41.835
I pinky swear.

48:41.919 --> 48:43.750
Pin ky swear.

48:47.133 --> 48:51.547
Kalia, my princess goddess up on
high, give your pops some loving.

48:56.809 --> 49:01.974
You gotta shave, Mr. Flavor-Saver,
for my party because it feels yucky.

49:05.860 --> 49:07.475
Go on and get some book learning.

49:07.570 --> 49:10.937
And I'll pick you up from
your ma's on Saturday, okay?

49:32.261 --> 49:39.303
God, grant me the serenity to
accept the things I cannot change...

49:39.393 --> 49:42.635
- the courage...
- Amen.

49:43.063 --> 49:46.271
to change the things I can...

49:46.525 --> 49:49.688
and the wisdom to know the difference.

49:49.778 --> 49:51.939
- Amen.
- Amen.

49:52.031 --> 49:53.271
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

49:53.365 --> 49:58.029
Take 10, go smoke, do your toilette
or whatnot before group starts.

49:58.120 --> 50:00.987
And bring yourjournals because
you got your assignment, right?

50:01.081 --> 50:06.576
The Eleventh Step, a daily
connection with God as you define her.

50:06.670 --> 50:09.457
All right, so quit
gawking and start writing.

50:10.090 --> 50:13.503
Looking at you, José. You're up first.

50:30.694 --> 50:33.811
Oh, snap.

50:33.864 --> 50:37.903
One-900-Linden. Dial
and you shall receive.

50:40.204 --> 50:41.785
Hi.

50:43.165 --> 50:44.826
Hi, Holder.

50:46.085 --> 50:48.246
What up, Linden?

50:50.297 --> 50:53.664
I heard you got a new job.

50:53.926 --> 50:55.882
I see you got a new scarf.

50:55.970 --> 50:58.632
Yeah, Ross Dress for
Less, three-for-one rack.

50:58.764 --> 51:00.755
Oh, snap, Linden got jokes?

51:05.646 --> 51:06.886
You're looking good.

51:06.981 --> 51:08.562
You too.

51:08.649 --> 51:10.059
You look happy.

51:10.943 --> 51:14.106
Happy, joyous and free, that's me.

51:15.489 --> 51:17.275
I'm a daddy.

51:17.700 --> 51:20.612
- Got a little girl.
- That's so great.

51:20.703 --> 51:22.614
What's her name?

51:23.706 --> 51:26.573
- Kalia.
- Oh, that's great.

51:26.667 --> 51:30.159
She's the goddess of life and
death in the Hindustani traditions.

51:30.254 --> 51:31.494
Oh, so you're Hindu now?

51:31.589 --> 51:32.874
You know how we do.

51:37.469 --> 51:39.334
When'd you come back?

51:40.556 --> 51:44.390
I'm not back, I'm just passing through.

51:44.852 --> 51:48.436
I've been on the road a
lot the last few years.

51:49.231 --> 51:53.144
Um, I was in Chicago for a
while. Jack's in college now.

51:53.819 --> 51:58.483
- He's almost as tall as you.
- What? Damn.

52:00.492 --> 52:04.405
So did you find him on your travels
in the big wide world, Linden?

52:04.496 --> 52:05.997
The bad guy.

52:07.458 --> 52:09.915
There is no bad guy.

52:10.836 --> 52:16.297
There's just... I don't know, life.

52:17.259 --> 52:21.218
We tried at least. You gotta
give us credit for trying.

52:21.305 --> 52:23.341
Yeah, we did.

52:26.393 --> 52:28.850
Anyway, Ijust, um...

52:32.441 --> 52:34.978
It's good to see you, Holder.

52:35.944 --> 52:37.809
So why are you here?

52:38.155 --> 52:39.691
For real?

52:41.033 --> 52:42.273
Hm?

52:46.205 --> 52:47.741
I never...

52:49.249 --> 52:53.583
had a real house to grow up in.

52:54.630 --> 52:56.461
You know, home.

52:58.384 --> 53:02.878
I never belonged anywhere.

53:04.223 --> 53:09.388
And all my life, I was
looking for that thing...

53:10.062 --> 53:11.552
you know.

53:11.980 --> 53:15.063
Thinking that it was out there somewhere.

53:15.150 --> 53:17.892
That all I had to do was find it.

53:21.949 --> 53:24.565
But I think, maybe...

53:25.619 --> 53:27.200
that home was us.

53:30.624 --> 53:34.742
It was you and me together
in that stupid car...

53:36.130 --> 53:39.338
riding around, smoking cigarettes.

53:41.009 --> 53:43.295
I think that was everything.

53:47.141 --> 53:49.177
I'm sorry.

53:53.188 --> 53:58.182
I should have known that you
were one person who always stays.

54:00.487 --> 54:02.819
And you were my best friend.

54:06.827 --> 54:08.613
Why don't you stay?

54:10.497 --> 54:11.998
Stay.

54:13.876 --> 54:15.457
Um...

54:16.378 --> 54:19.461
I think that this city...

54:21.508 --> 54:24.625
is a city of the dead for me, it's...

54:24.887 --> 54:27.048
It's a matter of perception, ain't it?

54:32.060 --> 54:33.561
Close your eyes.

54:33.645 --> 54:35.681
- What?
- Just close your eyes.

54:35.856 --> 54:37.642
No. You're so weird.

54:37.691 --> 54:40.182
Just close your eyes.

54:40.694 --> 54:42.855
Just give it a try.

54:44.615 --> 54:47.197
Maybe you'll see what's really there...

54:48.911 --> 54:51.402
standing right in front of you.

54:57.085 --> 54:59.371
It ain't ghosts, Linden.

55:00.798 --> 55:02.754
It ain't the dead.

55:06.887 --> 55:09.549
- I'm gonna get a ticket, I should go.
- Linden.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.221
Yeah?

55:20.609 --> 55:22.099
Bye.

55:25.989 --> 55:27.490
Bye.
