FILM 5

01:08.240 --> 01:10.920
<i>Your home is your fortress.</i>

01:11.560 --> 01:13.320
<i>But why do you need a fortress?</i>

01:13.400 --> 01:15.640
<i>Who is attacking you?</i>

02:15.160 --> 02:18.160
Have you gone crazy?
I forbade you from taking the weapon.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.840
How’d you open the safe?

02:20.240 --> 02:23.960
I used the year you were born.
How touching.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.280
So sexy.

02:33.480 --> 02:37.040
Only you have this habit
of sleeping with the balcony open.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.400
They’ll rob you after all. Yeah?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.960
Maybe you should lock her in the safe?

02:42.560 --> 02:45.640
Go to sleep. We’ll talk in the morning!

03:07.040 --> 03:08.680
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

03:10.080 --> 03:11.600
<i>I love you.</i>

03:29.440 --> 03:31.440
Tell me, did you have sex?

03:33.600 --> 03:35.920
-What?
-Did you sleep with him?

03:38.520 --> 03:41.680
It’s not the first time I’ve heard that.
It’s none of your business.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.720
I hope you don’t think
I’m asking just out of curiosity.

03:48.440 --> 03:53.120
It’s important for me to know
how close you were emotionally.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.680
I’m telling you. We…

04:00.200 --> 04:03.560
Thanks. I understand everything.
Let’s get back to the case.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.560
The athlete?

04:10.920 --> 04:15.000
TROITSK

04:15.080 --> 04:16.760
She was shot with the pillow.

04:17.839 --> 04:19.880
The father was simply shot in the head.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.240
You know,
you were called out here for nothing.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.320
We’ve already caught him.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.840
-The killer?
-It’s their son.

04:31.640 --> 04:35.360
This is already the fifth murder.
The handwriting is the same.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.520
He entered through the balcony door.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.760
Lots of people are keeping
them open at night. It’s stuffy.

04:41.720 --> 04:44.360
He killed the parents,
left the kids alive.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.480
There was a trophy near the bodies.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.600
In each apartment,
there were shelves full of trophies.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.040
The kids played sports.
He knew them. He’s also an athlete.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.840
He knew where they lived.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.000
-He also knew the parents, naturally.
-Why’d he kill them?

04:58.080 --> 04:59.960
His father found a new wife.

05:00.040 --> 05:04.480
He and the stepmother didn’t get along.
I think he hated adults.

05:04.560 --> 05:08.080
He’s proving that he’s stronger.
The trophy represents his victory.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.200
So, the Rubik’s Cube is solved.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.520
What do you have here?

05:13.600 --> 05:17.760
Will you tell us when you take the bodies?
It stinks in here, and it’s stuffy.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.560
Uh-huh. And what’s that there?

05:19.640 --> 05:23.600
It’s a fire alarm.
Now every home has them.

05:24.040 --> 05:25.600
It’s the law.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.880
It’s the son, I’m telling you.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.400
Why come through the balcony
if there’s a door?

05:30.480 --> 05:33.640
So, that’s the thing. It’s… It’s special.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.400
From the street,
you can see someone climbing the wall.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.880
It’s clear he’s a thief.
Who’d think of him?

05:38.960 --> 05:41.320
-Only someone who’s not normal.
-So you’re normal.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.680
Are you mocking me?

05:42.760 --> 05:44.840
I have all the evidence against him.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.280
He was a professional gymnast.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.880
He climbs like a monkey.
His father is a veteran.

05:49.960 --> 05:53.240
There’s a pistol in the house.
They’re zombies in front of the TV.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.120
Kids don’t know
what to do with themselves.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.960
And he found himself a toy.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.880
A pistol? Where’s the pistol?

05:58.960 --> 06:00.440
Pistol-- Step aside.

06:01.120 --> 06:04.040
The boy says that it’s here.
I don’t think it’s here.

06:04.640 --> 06:07.120
The guys are coming to open it now.
We’ll see.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.320
Understood. No big deal.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.360
-Are you planning a vacation?
-What?

06:12.440 --> 06:15.680
To Turkey? You should.
It’s “all inclusive” there.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.000
I just thought,
you solved a serial killing.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.920
It would be good to give a vacation
to a man who deserves it.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.600
Did the boy confess?

06:23.080 --> 06:26.720
Of course not. He says he slept
with headphones on, didn’t hear a thing.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.680
Are you going to talk?
You aren’t going to say anything?

06:31.280 --> 06:33.840
Do you really not understand
what will happen to you?

06:33.920 --> 06:35.880
-Stand up.
-Get out of here.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.680
So, are you messing with us?
Why are you silent?

06:39.200 --> 06:40.680
Say it. “I’m messing with you.”

06:40.760 --> 06:43.200
-Now there’s something to deny?
-I didn’t kill them.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.440
Leave. Go on.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.440
Go on.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.880
And close the door.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.360
Did you take the gun. Tell the truth.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.160
-I took it.
-Why?

07:05.120 --> 07:07.760
To show my friends, and a girl.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.680
Just so. That’s what guns are made for.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.600
Did the girl give it up?

07:15.280 --> 07:16.280
She gave it up. Is that your mom?

07:22.400 --> 07:25.360
Sorry for asking, but when did she die?

07:27.160 --> 07:29.320
Three years ago. Cancer.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.400
And your dad
found someone else for himself.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.680
He betrayed your mother.

07:40.040 --> 07:43.600
Betrayal is a normal human trait.

07:46.800 --> 07:52.400
It’s necessary to counterbalance
willpower and ambition somehow.

07:55.080 --> 07:56.720
You didn’t try to forgive your dad?

07:59.440 --> 08:01.800
-You decided to kill him.
-I didn’t kill him!

08:02.400 --> 08:05.120
Why not? Didn’t have the guts?

08:05.720 --> 08:08.400
You didn’t have the guts.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.440
Why are you standing? Sit down.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.320
Sit.

08:16.880 --> 08:19.320
Tell someone else about the girls,
all right?

08:22.480 --> 08:27.200
You walked circles around this safe
when he brought her here. Correct?

08:34.440 --> 08:38.360
<i>First he tried your mother’s birthday</i>
<i>for the code.</i>

08:39.760 --> 08:41.360
<i>And then it hit you.</i>

08:41.960 --> 08:44.400
<i>He used your stepmother’s birthday.</i>

08:46.600 --> 08:47.800
<i>Correct?</i>

08:50.440 --> 08:54.080
<i>When he met her,</i>
<i>she was probably all he could think of.</i>

08:58.360 --> 09:01.600
<i>You took the gun, walked around</i>
<i>the apartment. Did you aim it?</i>

09:05.880 --> 09:07.080
<i>Rehearsing?</i>

09:14.640 --> 09:17.800
<i>A good musician, after all, rehearses.</i>

09:17.880 --> 09:19.720
<i>Then he plays. Plays, indeed…</i>

09:21.120 --> 09:23.000
just as the music is written.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.960
-When did your father notice?
-Yesterday.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.680
He changed the pass code before he died.

09:33.320 --> 09:34.720
How old are you?

09:36.360 --> 09:37.440
Seventeen.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.000
One-nine-nine-eight.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.880
The year you were born.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.360
If it works, will you forgive your father?

09:56.840 --> 09:58.040
Let’s go. Come on.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.920
The gun is in its place.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.600
Take him away. Let’s go.

11:20.560 --> 11:24.320
If he grabbed onto the cornice,
that means he’s taller than me.

11:25.640 --> 11:27.080
That means he’s an adult.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.040
Thank you.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.640
Height isn’t always a sign of age.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.280
-If I see anything, I’ll let you know.
-All right.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.600
We checked the security camera.
Nothing there.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.000
You go on. I’ll catch up.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.280
Suit yourself.

11:53.960 --> 11:54.960
What do you see?

11:59.880 --> 12:02.400
I already showed them.
Do you want to look again?

12:02.480 --> 12:04.320
No magazines or newspapers.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.920
You aren’t bored?
No magazines or newspapers?

12:10.560 --> 12:12.800
It’s boring, but I’m on the job.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.040
Why are you sweating so much?

12:16.120 --> 12:17.120
It’s hot.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.080
How many cameras are in the building?

12:22.160 --> 12:24.760
-Well, in each--
-There’s one at each entrance.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.880
-There’s two outside. Six in total.
-How many wires?

12:32.640 --> 12:34.200
About 50.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.800
Did you install the fire alarms
in the apartments,

12:37.240 --> 12:38.840
Valery Vasilevich?

12:39.720 --> 12:40.960
Me.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.920
The tenants weren’t happy.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.640
Our Valery Vasilevich has nimble fingers

12:47.480 --> 12:49.240
and protects us from thieves

12:49.720 --> 12:51.360
and installs cameras

12:51.440 --> 12:53.360
and knows about firefighting.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.520
And all that for one salary.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.680
They don’t understand, the fools,
that not everything is measured by money.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.480
Valera,
do you work for curiosity’s sake?

13:01.560 --> 13:04.840
There are stories in those apartments
better than in any German porn.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.880
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

13:06.960 --> 13:10.040
Well, you’ll have a lot of time to think.

13:10.520 --> 13:11.920
Get the handcuffs.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.640
There’s no need for handcuffs.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.920
I only watched them myself.
I didn’t show anyone.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.960
-I’ll delete everything.
-No, Valer, let’s not do that.

13:22.040 --> 13:25.400
Let’s do this. You took it secretly,
but now share it with friends.

13:25.480 --> 13:28.600
It turns out you get to see it,
but no one else does.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.000
Show us.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.560
Show you what?

13:33.520 --> 13:35.120
The really interesting stuff.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.760
And you too?

13:39.840 --> 13:41.840
Nice to meet you.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.960
I’ll show you now.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.120
So…

13:48.960 --> 13:50.280
There you go.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.440
Wow!

13:51.960 --> 13:53.480
Mother dear!

13:55.200 --> 13:57.480
-Is there more?
-There is.

13:57.560 --> 13:59.280
One more.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.200
There you go.

14:00.280 --> 14:03.120
Valera, you have quite the collection.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.800
Is there a camera in Room 38?

14:05.880 --> 14:08.160
There’s a lively couple, recently married.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.920
Show us around 2:00 in the morning.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Probably the same-- rolling in the hay.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.720
So, 38…

14:14.760 --> 14:17.880
Second day, eighth month… So…

14:17.960 --> 14:21.560
And… two, zero-zero.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.720
And there goes the gunman.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.480
What will happen to me now?

15:02.240 --> 15:03.440
I don’t know.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.240
There’s our main suspect.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.800
IGOR IVANOV

15:21.560 --> 15:22.960
OUR CHAMPIONS

15:23.040 --> 15:24.800
Igor trained here.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.520
But he isn’t the killer.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.280
Do you think
the real killer trains here too?

15:29.360 --> 15:31.800
-What’s the trainer’s name? Vladimir…
-Akopovich.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.880
That’s who you should’ve trained under.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.720
And what do you want.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.280
The great achievements of sports
come from hard work.

15:38.360 --> 15:41.000
Pain and humiliation. Go on.

15:41.080 --> 15:44.480
Holy moly, you’re turning on
the waterworks again here?

15:44.880 --> 15:48.680
In 30 years,
I’ve never seen a sniveler like you.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.520
Vladimir Akopovich.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.440
Go on, work! I’m listening.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.160
Work, I said.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.640
Investigative Committee.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.040
What’s the occasion?

15:57.600 --> 16:00.320
Tell us, please, about your star student.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.960
His father was outstanding.

16:03.640 --> 16:05.320
But Igor, not so much.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.000
What do you mean?

16:07.080 --> 16:09.640
Girls, why are you standing around?
Go on, work.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.720
Igor couldn’t have stayed here
if it wasn’t for his father.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.720
He’d be after him with a stick
to get him to practice.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.240
Igor cried, but he came.

16:19.320 --> 16:23.240
Because he knew
his father wouldn’t abandon him.

16:23.320 --> 16:24.840
Why are you standing around?

16:24.920 --> 16:28.320
You can stand around at home.
Go on, work. I said work.

16:29.080 --> 16:33.120
Then he bulked up his muscles.
There went his wins.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.640
His father was outstanding.

16:36.360 --> 16:40.160
Can you really take a person
and make a champion out of him,

16:40.240 --> 16:41.760
even against his will?

16:41.840 --> 16:44.680
Will? What kind of will do they have?
They’re children.

16:46.040 --> 16:48.280
They only have computers on their mind.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.120
Their heads are full of the Internet
and games.

16:52.200 --> 16:56.360
And gymnastics is 90 percent work.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.600
And the other 10 percent is humiliation?

16:59.920 --> 17:02.720
Behind each of these prizes, above all…

17:03.720 --> 17:06.599
there’s blood, sweat, and tears.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.400
Whose?

17:12.599 --> 17:14.680
I’m sorry. Good-bye.

17:24.400 --> 17:26.560
MOSCOW

17:26.640 --> 17:28.079
INTERNAL AFFAIRS / AUGUST 14

17:28.160 --> 17:30.000
Just as in the previous murders,

17:30.080 --> 17:35.120
the killer used a Luger P. 08,
made in 1900.

17:35.200 --> 17:38.320
Stop.
The pistol was more than 100 years old?

17:38.400 --> 17:40.720
The Wehrmacht used them in World War II.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.200
Is that so?

17:42.760 --> 17:46.760
He used a cartridge for a 9x19 Parabellum.

17:46.840 --> 17:49.560
It only fits this model.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.520
What about that thing I asked for?

18:05.520 --> 18:09.360
We checked all registered Lugers
in museums and private collections.

18:09.440 --> 18:12.960
They’re all there. Not one was used.
So the gun isn’t registered.

18:13.040 --> 18:16.200
It was bought on the black market.
Big deal. Yeah?

18:18.960 --> 18:21.920
Why are you acting like the second file
doesn’t interest you?

18:23.480 --> 18:25.080
Are you training your willpower?

18:26.480 --> 18:28.680
Go on, read it. I’ll wait.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.480
BALLISTICS REPORT

18:41.080 --> 18:43.520
…MAKAROV PISTOL…
…VERA STEKLOVA…

18:43.600 --> 18:45.360
…SERVICE WEAPON…

18:45.960 --> 18:48.360
A service weapon killed my mother?

18:50.680 --> 18:51.840
Registered to…

18:51.920 --> 18:53.520
…REGISTERED TO OGNARYOV…

18:54.120 --> 18:56.320
-Who is Maksim Ognaryov?
-Why don’t you love your father?

18:56.400 --> 18:58.560
-I love my father.
-Because he isn’t dead?

18:59.400 --> 19:01.320
You thought he should be
since your mother’s gone.

19:01.400 --> 19:05.040
It turned out it’s possible to live on,
to eat breakfast, dinner, lunch.

19:05.440 --> 19:06.760
To smile.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.640
-You can’t forgive him.
-You’re wrong.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.360
-I don’t want to talk about that now.
-I’m just being honest.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.600
-Do you like me?
-What?

19:15.080 --> 19:16.080
No!

19:17.040 --> 19:19.320
When you’re lying, you always go--

19:20.040 --> 19:21.240
Pay attention.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.960
-Hello, Andrei Sergeyevich
-Greetings.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.800
What are you doing here?

19:34.880 --> 19:36.480
I’m happy to see you too.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.080
The department heads meet here.
Is that okay with you?

19:40.160 --> 19:40.920
How are you?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.080
We’re fine,
but the criminals are becoming petty.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.440
-Is the trainee coping?
-She learns quick.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.440
-What are you studying?
-A report on a new case.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.280
These black marketers have some nerve.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.360
They’re selling guns left and right.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.600
They have no respect for the past.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.320
I understand. You want to catch up.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.080
I’ll be in touch, Andrei Sergeyevich.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.120
You don’t have a phone.

20:08.760 --> 20:11.520
-You wanted out. What changed?
-Everything.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.440
How long do you plan to train under him?

20:13.520 --> 20:15.880
-Until he runs me off.
-That means not long.

20:16.960 --> 20:19.560
Does the name Maksim Ognaryov
mean anything to you?

20:20.480 --> 20:21.440
Maksim Ognaryov.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.200
No. Who’s that?

20:24.920 --> 20:26.160
Never mind.

20:27.680 --> 20:30.520
Today, I’ll be off earlier.
I can make dinner.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.000
I’ll be late.
It’s been 40 days since Anulya’s death.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.680
And I’ll find Ognaryov.

20:54.640 --> 21:00.840
My dear ones, thank you for coming,
for not forgetting Anulechka.

21:10.120 --> 21:13.640
She came to see me early this morning.

21:17.720 --> 21:21.200
She said, “I can’t-- I can’t rest, Mama.”

21:22.360 --> 21:24.520
I asked her, “How come, Anulechka?”

21:24.600 --> 21:26.320
You don’t have to, Nin. “I prepared your bed myself.

21:29.720 --> 21:30.720
It’s soft.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.640
Is something stopping you?”

21:36.280 --> 21:37.520
And she said…

21:39.560 --> 21:44.720
“Mama,
I can’t sleep while he roams this earth.”

21:44.800 --> 21:46.680
Hush, hush. It’s over.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.880
Mom, don’t cry. Don’t cry.

21:49.760 --> 21:52.240
He’ll be punished, right?

21:53.560 --> 21:54.760
Right.

22:16.640 --> 22:18.240
What was that just now?

22:19.040 --> 22:21.560
-Nothing.
-Don’t make a fool out of me.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.680
You want to say
that someone else offed Anka?

22:25.280 --> 22:26.880
I don’t understand.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.880
Esen, is that true? Damn, you can’t go anywhere without him.

22:35.800 --> 22:38.520
I’m not supposed to talk about this…
in theory.

22:41.480 --> 22:43.520
Prazdnichny was a puppet…

22:44.680 --> 22:45.880
a tool.

22:46.760 --> 22:48.720
Someone else is behind this.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.360
Someone else? But who?

22:51.960 --> 22:52.800
Nobody knows.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.080
Not even your Meglin?

22:58.280 --> 22:59.560
Your amazing Meglin.

23:00.120 --> 23:02.920
Guys, I already told you a lot.
So good-bye.

23:03.320 --> 23:05.240
Esen, wait.

23:05.320 --> 23:06.920
Sash, what else?

23:11.240 --> 23:13.400
I want to talk,
and you’re always disappearing.

23:13.480 --> 23:14.480
Talk.

23:15.920 --> 23:17.760
You don’t have to speak to me that way.

23:17.840 --> 23:19.400
-What do you mean “that way”?
-Yeah--

23:22.280 --> 23:23.680
Condescendingly.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.520
Can you take me seriously?

23:26.120 --> 23:27.120
-Seriously?
-Yes.

23:27.200 --> 23:27.920
Okay.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.320
Sash. You’re a very good, proper, smart,
and boring guy.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.200
That’s why I’ll never be with you.

23:35.880 --> 23:36.600
Straightforward.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.040
-I’ll get him myself.
-Who?

23:51.800 --> 23:53.280
The guy who killed Anya.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.880
The standard is in your hands.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.080
And in yours.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.600
Can I stay the night here?

24:45.640 --> 24:47.640
Yet you say you don’t like me.

24:48.760 --> 24:50.160
What happened? I don’t want to go home.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.880
He’s lying again.

25:00.120 --> 25:02.640
You all right with me coming here?

25:26.120 --> 25:27.560
He has a limp.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.480
Even so, he climbs like a monkey.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.200
A former athlete with an injury?

25:37.080 --> 25:38.520
Totally possible.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.640
-<i>Yes?</i>
-Glukhoi, listen, be a pal.

25:51.720 --> 25:54.760
We had a gun show up on a case.

25:54.840 --> 25:58.600
It’s really ancient--
a Luger from World War II.

25:58.680 --> 26:01.480
The boss says it could’ve been bought
on the black market.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.200
Will you do some digging for us?

26:07.600 --> 26:09.560
Thank you. All right, bye.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.800
BUY A LUGER

26:16.440 --> 26:18.440
Why does he kill these people?

26:20.480 --> 26:22.040
Does he have some connection to them?

26:31.360 --> 26:34.000
I not only have the right to work…

26:35.680 --> 26:37.280
but I also to have some rest…

26:42.680 --> 26:44.840
in my own home.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.800
Do you call this place home?

26:54.720 --> 26:58.600
Apartments, of course, are for amateurs,

26:59.160 --> 27:01.240
but you invited yourself in.

27:06.520 --> 27:09.200
And after Mom died, I hated our home.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.760
For me, it simply became…

27:15.440 --> 27:16.840
a house.

27:19.360 --> 27:21.720
So I think to myself,
“I’m going to the house.”

27:24.680 --> 27:27.280
Of course, out loud,
I say “I’m going home.”

27:27.360 --> 27:29.000
I follow the conventions.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.800
Have you lived here long?

29:34.840 --> 29:36.120
Yes?

29:41.880 --> 29:44.640
I understand. We’re leaving.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.200
Soon.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.400
What is this?

30:16.960 --> 30:18.200
Order.

30:34.560 --> 30:35.720
What have you done?

30:37.200 --> 30:40.120
I’ve been cleaning since 6:00 this morning
while you were sleeping.

30:48.560 --> 30:50.520
You think it’s that simple here?

30:51.240 --> 30:54.800
Is stuff just lying around everywhere
for no reason? Of course not!

30:54.880 --> 30:57.560
It doesn’t matter.
You’ll put things right in a few days.

31:01.520 --> 31:02.960
He’s killed again.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.600
A detective called. We have to go.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.880
I’m not going anywhere.
Make me some coffee.

31:07.680 --> 31:10.600
-What?
-Make me some coffee!

31:11.480 --> 31:13.880
You did what wasn’t asked of you.
Now do what is asked.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.640
They’re waiting for us at the crime scene. What’s there that I haven’t seen?

31:17.480 --> 31:19.600
If you like to look at bodies, go.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.880
Just make me some coffee first.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.920
-Where’s the coffee?
-In the tin!

31:44.000 --> 31:45.480
-What are you doing?
-The coffee.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.240
Let’s go! Coffee. -Come out from there.
-I don’t want to!

32:11.440 --> 32:13.680
-Come on, come out!
-I don’t want to!

32:13.760 --> 32:16.400
Come here, Vanechka.
Please don’t be afraid.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.600
-Vanya, come here.
-No! I don’t want to.

32:19.520 --> 32:22.040
The boy heard gunshots
and hid under the bed.

32:23.440 --> 32:25.600
Time of death
was around 2:00 this morning.

32:43.840 --> 32:44.840
Yes. He’s here.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.120
Valera who?

32:58.520 --> 33:01.040
-Valera, hello, dear fellow.
-Hello.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.360
So did your bright little eyes
see anything?

33:04.440 --> 33:06.280
Yes, I have something. Come in.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.200
There you go.

33:24.240 --> 33:25.680
What’s he doing?

33:25.760 --> 33:26.960
He’s looking around.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.600
So it turns out we have the next address?

33:35.680 --> 33:37.200
Which house is it?

33:37.280 --> 33:39.520
It’s number 34, Building 1.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.080
You bastard! There! Take that!

35:17.600 --> 35:18.800
Freeze!

35:20.640 --> 35:22.080
Hands behind your head.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.400
You won’t kill me. You can’t.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.480
Son of a bitch!

36:12.360 --> 36:14.320
I couldn’t shoot him. I’m sorry. Out of human kindness?

36:16.440 --> 36:17.840
Or out of weakness?

36:21.160 --> 36:22.760
We have a camera. At any time, he--

36:22.840 --> 36:24.840
He’ll be in hiding now. He’s not a fool.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.240
He knows they’re looking for him.

36:31.400 --> 36:32.120
I saw him.

36:33.120 --> 36:34.120
Congratulations.

36:36.840 --> 36:39.400
He’ll pop up in another city,
and it’ll start all over.

36:44.360 --> 36:45.360
Damn it.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.880
What do we know about him?

36:53.400 --> 36:55.000
He’s around 40.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.840
He’s a former athlete with a limp.

36:58.160 --> 37:00.120
He knows kids in athletics programs.

37:00.200 --> 37:04.960
The kids practice together in one group
because they live in the same district.

37:05.040 --> 37:06.720
-And he knows that.
-Here you go.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.960
I’m giving you a chance
to redeem yourself.

37:17.560 --> 37:21.400
A young man who trained with you
at the end of the ’80s, start of the ’90s.

37:21.480 --> 37:23.200
Medium height, slim.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.400
It’s possible he left due to a leg injury.

37:26.360 --> 37:28.840
-Which leg?
-The left.

37:31.800 --> 37:33.000
Volodya. Volodya’s last name?

37:35.760 --> 37:36.960
Strizhenov.

37:38.960 --> 37:40.360
He showed up here. Why’d he come?

37:43.080 --> 37:45.480
He was looking for kids with talent.

37:45.560 --> 37:46.760
Thank you.

38:01.120 --> 38:02.920
-Make yourself at home.
-Thank you.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.400
What are you up to?

38:04.480 --> 38:07.240
You decide to write an article this late.

38:09.960 --> 38:14.440
And you learned so late that our district…

38:15.680 --> 38:17.720
is home to such an outstanding athlete.

38:18.240 --> 38:20.600
The country should know about its heroes.

38:20.680 --> 38:22.200
He was no hero.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.440
But he could’ve been a world champion.

38:26.320 --> 38:30.480
He screwed it all up himself
because he was angry and stubborn.

38:30.560 --> 38:32.640
-You could’ve been one.
-No, I couldn’t!

38:33.600 --> 38:34.800
He could!

38:38.160 --> 38:40.440
I put so much effort into him.

38:41.600 --> 38:44.360
I drove him
till he couldn’t see straight.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.080
And he dug in his heels.

38:46.160 --> 38:48.560
I asked him,
“Do you want to be a champion?”

38:49.560 --> 38:51.720
He said, “I want to study birds.”

38:51.800 --> 38:53.880
Imagine that nonsense in his head!

38:53.960 --> 38:55.960
He was reading books about birds!

38:56.640 --> 39:00.480
Just before the Soviet championships,
I tripled his workload.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.480
He had this character trait.

39:03.560 --> 39:07.720
Anyone else that stubborn would cry,
but he-- He just got angry.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.320
And using that anger,

39:09.400 --> 39:14.360
he executed maneuvers you wouldn’t believe
the human body was capable of.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.280
He could’ve been a champion.

39:24.520 --> 39:25.640
He could have.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.200
And then…

39:28.880 --> 39:30.840
We were practicing dismounts.

39:32.280 --> 39:34.160
I came up with one for him myself.

39:34.240 --> 39:38.520
He’d have a gold medal in his pocket
for this dismount, but he…

39:38.600 --> 39:40.360
He was angry during practice.

39:41.760 --> 39:45.640
He started his dismount with a twist.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.120
He fell on his leg.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.600
Compound fracture.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.520
He could’ve been a champion… but he ended up a cripple.

40:06.280 --> 40:07.840
Even when we got this apartment,

40:07.920 --> 40:11.360
he could climb down the balconies
faster than I could use the elevator.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.480
All out of spite!

40:19.320 --> 40:21.480
And how can we find Volodya?

40:22.480 --> 40:24.400
I want to hear his side.

40:25.280 --> 40:28.680
Volodya left us in ’93.

40:29.320 --> 40:30.960
You haven’t seen him since?

40:31.040 --> 40:33.720
-You haven’t tried to find him?
-I tried.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.800
He didn’t want me to.

40:39.800 --> 40:43.000
-If you do see him, will you tell us?
-He doesn’t need anything!

40:50.080 --> 40:51.720
He needs nothing from us…

40:54.880 --> 40:56.480
nor we from him.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.880
He had a family, a son.

41:08.160 --> 41:09.880
Do you know their address?

41:09.960 --> 41:12.400
They divorced.
He doesn’t live there anymore.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.840
But Lenochka, his ex-wife,

41:14.920 --> 41:18.920
earlier on, used to let him see his son.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.560
But then he took his son to work.

41:21.640 --> 41:25.440
She got scared
and stopped him from seeing him.

41:25.520 --> 41:26.960
So he got angry.

41:27.040 --> 41:29.960
During the night, he climbed
over the balcony to see his son.

41:30.480 --> 41:35.040
Lenochka threatened to call the police,
and he stopped.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.800
You said Volodya took his son to work.
What was his job?

41:39.280 --> 41:43.160
It’s either a crane operator
or in high-rise construction.

41:43.240 --> 41:45.320
Something to do with being high up.

41:45.400 --> 41:47.040
You said he loved birds.

41:49.560 --> 41:52.160
-Thank you.
-Wait.

41:53.760 --> 41:57.240
If you… find him, then…

41:58.640 --> 42:02.560
tell him hello, please, from his parents.

42:03.800 --> 42:05.200
If he’ll accept it.

42:16.480 --> 42:18.080
Where should we look for him?

42:19.920 --> 42:22.720
A construction worker isn’t an artist,
even if he is tortured.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.440
Did you hear anything from Glukhoi?

42:24.520 --> 42:26.200
-I’ll call him now.
-Go on.

42:32.920 --> 42:34.440
<i>Yes? Who’s this?</i>

42:34.800 --> 42:37.000
Add my number already.

42:37.440 --> 42:39.000
<i>Did you find out what we asked?</i>

42:39.320 --> 42:40.600
Give me the beard.

42:41.680 --> 42:43.000
It’s for you.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.800
-Well?
-<i>I haven’t heard from any black marketers.</i>

42:49.880 --> 42:52.360
<i>The cops aren’t the only ones</i>
<i>scaring them off. The feds too.</i>

42:52.440 --> 42:54.520
Everything is under strict control.

42:54.600 --> 42:58.240
If something surfaces,
they immediately have their sights on it.

42:58.600 --> 43:01.560
And if not,
how could you get information about it?

43:01.640 --> 43:03.240
They won’t tell you themselves.

43:03.840 --> 43:05.560
<i>It seems like a dead end.</i>

43:06.040 --> 43:08.200
<i>But listen up.</i>

43:08.280 --> 43:11.640
<i>While I was trying to get the information</i>
<i>from the cops,</i>

43:12.240 --> 43:14.280
<i>something interesting came out.</i>

43:15.480 --> 43:21.280
<i>The apartment buildings where the murders</i>
<i>occurred were recently constructed.</i>

43:21.360 --> 43:23.560
<i>There’s another being constructed</i>
<i>close by.</i>

43:23.640 --> 43:25.560
<i>The contractor is the same.</i>

43:25.640 --> 43:28.240
<i>That means the workers are, too,</i>
<i>most likely.</i>

43:28.320 --> 43:32.120
<i>Now then, recently</i>
<i>the cops went to the construction site.</i>

43:32.200 --> 43:34.400
<i>There was a shooting there at night.</i>

43:35.200 --> 43:37.200
<i>Well, they showed up, walked around.</i>

43:37.760 --> 43:40.640
<i>It was empty. No bodies, no one.</i>

43:42.680 --> 43:44.880
If he works here, then where does he live?

43:46.040 --> 43:47.440
What are the options?

43:49.240 --> 43:50.400
Let’s go.

43:50.480 --> 43:52.840
<i>The Luger is an old pistol.</i>

43:52.920 --> 43:55.000
<i>You have to shoot it often.</i>

43:55.080 --> 43:58.280
<i>And it’s so simple to shoot there.</i>
<i>Who’d be there?</i>

43:59.200 --> 44:01.600
<i>The construction site</i>
<i>is next to the murders.</i>

44:01.680 --> 44:03.080
<i>Get the hint?</i>

44:59.400 --> 45:01.160
He has a son, a job.

45:01.800 --> 45:03.640
Why did he start killing?

45:07.360 --> 45:09.280
Compassion breeds monsters.

45:18.560 --> 45:20.560
He wanted to save these guys…

45:22.000 --> 45:25.440
so they wouldn’t suffer the same fate.

45:25.520 --> 45:26.920
Take your pills.

45:29.720 --> 45:32.400
He saw himself in each of them.

45:32.480 --> 45:34.800
That little boy

45:35.400 --> 45:39.520
whose father forced him to be
what he didn’t want to be--

45:39.840 --> 45:40.800
Take your pills!

45:40.880 --> 45:42.360
…a world champion.

45:42.440 --> 45:44.560
He just wanted to be a child.

45:50.760 --> 45:51.920
-Thirty-eight…
-I can’t!

45:52.000 --> 45:53.680
You can! You can do it all!

45:53.760 --> 45:57.840
Forty-one! Forty-two! Level I said! Level!

45:57.920 --> 45:59.400
Forty-three!

45:59.480 --> 46:00.800
Forty-four! Stop!

46:15.120 --> 46:17.120
Meglin! Help!

46:22.000 --> 46:23.280
Rodion!

46:43.480 --> 46:44.920
Look.

47:36.280 --> 47:38.000
You’ve been faking it!

47:39.520 --> 47:41.520
You weren’t having an episode.

47:42.400 --> 47:45.520
-He could’ve killed--
-I do have episodes…

47:52.360 --> 47:53.960
of love for people.

47:56.800 --> 48:00.520
Truthfully, lately less often.

48:07.120 --> 48:09.120
And I’m your trainer, after all.

48:09.600 --> 48:12.000
But you need to know
how to train yourself.

48:15.960 --> 48:17.800
Okay, let’s go get your sweatshirt.

48:17.880 --> 48:20.560
It’d be a pity if it disappeared.

48:20.960 --> 48:22.360
It suits you.

48:23.800 --> 48:25.960
It will also be a pity
if it doesn’t disappear.

48:26.040 --> 48:27.520
There would be questions.

48:47.320 --> 48:50.080
-And what now?
-I usually buy a cactus.

48:51.800 --> 48:53.800
Actually, you can buy one too.

48:54.640 --> 48:56.080
Your very first.

49:36.840 --> 49:38.200
Esenya Andreyevna…

49:40.080 --> 49:42.880
were you aware then
that he was manipulating you?

49:49.680 --> 49:52.600
He literally set you up in every case.

49:53.320 --> 49:55.920
If we’re calling a spade a spade,
he used you.

49:57.520 --> 49:58.720
So you wouldn’t quit,

49:58.800 --> 50:02.080
he dangled your mother’s case
in front of you like a carrot.

50:02.160 --> 50:05.680
He could’ve immediately
told you everything. Couldn’t he?

50:06.160 --> 50:08.520
You don’t understand a damn thing.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.720
Instead of carrying a child on your back
across the river it’s whole life…

50:19.720 --> 50:22.040
it’s better to teach him to swim.

50:25.880 --> 50:27.280
Don’t you get it?

51:31.240 --> 51:33.800
Dear Andrei,
sincerely wishing you happiness.

51:33.880 --> 51:35.840
Your friend, Maksim Ognaryov.

51:44.240 --> 51:49.880
PODMOSKOVYE
