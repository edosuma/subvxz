00:14.000 --> 00:15.250
-Ah!

00:16.041 --> 00:19.416
-Please.
-Are you jumping? Are you a monkey?

00:19.500 --> 00:21.208
-Please--
-Get down this instant!

00:22.291 --> 00:23.416
Are you Spider-Man?

00:24.500 --> 00:26.208
Is this thief also a monkey?

00:26.291 --> 00:28.125
-Didn't they tell you?
-Please.

00:28.208 --> 00:29.333
Angel has no mercy.

00:29.416 --> 00:30.666
I don't want to die.

00:30.750 --> 00:33.375
-You must die today.
-Please beg him for me.

00:33.458 --> 00:34.916
Angel wants to eat.

00:35.958 --> 00:37.458
-My love!

00:37.541 --> 00:38.750
Please!

00:38.833 --> 00:40.500
Give him more time.

00:40.583 --> 00:43.625
He can make money
from these children and their parents.

00:43.708 --> 00:46.125
Are the parents
and children philanthropists?

00:50.875 --> 00:53.208
You will figure it out.

00:53.291 --> 00:55.833
You'll find a way
when it's time, hmm?

00:57.125 --> 00:58.583
Please!

00:58.666 --> 01:00.500
Please, help me beg him.

01:00.583 --> 01:02.333
-Spider-Man.
-Sir?

01:03.000 --> 01:05.208
-You have one week.
-Ah!

01:05.291 --> 01:07.791
If not, Angel will eat you
down to your bones.

01:07.875 --> 01:09.208
Thank you very much, sir.

01:09.291 --> 01:10.375
Thank you, sir.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.291
Thank you.

01:37.166 --> 01:39.083
-Sorry.

01:39.750 --> 01:41.458
Gently, please, it's painful.

01:41.541 --> 01:44.916
Calm down. Are you whining like a child
because of this small injury?

01:49.166 --> 01:50.458
What is it?

01:54.083 --> 01:55.208
Ugh.

01:55.291 --> 01:58.500
Don't worry, I'll sell it quickly
and give you the money.

01:59.083 --> 01:59.958
Be still.

02:00.041 --> 02:03.500
Let me show you the rich kids
at the party I went to. Have a look.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.291
They are wealthy.

02:07.916 --> 02:10.750
Look at what you are showing me.

02:11.333 --> 02:12.208
Look at this.

02:12.291 --> 02:15.083
Carmen’s boyfriend and her best friend.
Look what they're doing.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.041
Carmen?

02:17.125 --> 02:19.666
<i>Shit.</i>

02:20.291 --> 02:21.791
Will you show her?

02:22.750 --> 02:24.375
How would that help me?

02:25.541 --> 02:28.041
They are rich, they would buy molly.

02:30.666 --> 02:33.750
Don't worry, I'll sell it off by Monday.

02:33.833 --> 02:36.750
I'll give you the money back, I swear.

03:15.416 --> 03:17.375
Get dressed
and meet me in the car.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.500
Uh, where are we going?

03:27.166 --> 03:28.166
What's up?

03:28.250 --> 03:31.333
Where is our money? Thief, we need it now.

03:31.416 --> 03:33.166
The day has not ended.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.958
Have you spent our money?

03:35.041 --> 03:36.083
No, no, no.

03:37.958 --> 03:40.833
I assure you
you'll receive your money today.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.458
You'll get me the money today?

03:42.541 --> 03:44.583
Is this guy mad?

03:44.666 --> 03:45.708
Come here!

03:45.791 --> 03:48.500
What is happening there, huh?

03:48.583 --> 03:49.916
Nothing, right?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.291
Leave there, all of you.

03:51.375 --> 03:53.125
Go do your jobs.

03:54.166 --> 03:56.875
That punch is a gift from Tuesday.

03:57.666 --> 03:59.500
He said if you don't pay back our money,

03:59.583 --> 04:01.500
every day you will get another punch.

04:01.583 --> 04:02.708
Thief.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.041
<i>The number</i>
<i>you have dialed cannot be reached.</i>

04:10.125 --> 04:12.333
<i>-Please try again later.</i>

04:13.041 --> 04:14.750
Her phone is still switched off.

04:14.833 --> 04:17.916
I swear I'll break that Ishaya's hands.
That fucking bastard!

04:18.000 --> 04:20.958
What if the video Carmen saw
is the one everybody's talking about?

04:21.041 --> 04:23.708
Then why would
she say we betrayed her, huh?

04:24.291 --> 04:26.916
-It doesn't make sense.
-Relax.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.083
If she's seen it,
she's seen it.

04:29.166 --> 04:31.875
-It's about time, anyway.
-But, Nen, you know about my…

04:33.250 --> 04:35.250
You know our plans.

04:36.958 --> 04:39.166
Graduate from Wilmer
and get your art grant?

04:39.250 --> 04:41.250
With the help of Carmen's dad.

04:42.291 --> 04:44.916
Then we can tell people about us

04:45.500 --> 04:47.416
before we go to London together.

04:48.583 --> 04:49.500
Fine.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.333
But do you really need Carmen's dad?

04:52.416 --> 04:54.083
I mean, you're good enough,

04:54.166 --> 04:56.583
and maybe you can
win this art grant on your own.

04:56.666 --> 04:59.833
Nen, with Carmen's dad, it is not a maybe.

05:00.416 --> 05:01.791
It's definitely!

05:02.791 --> 05:06.291
Now Carmen's seen the video, you think
she'll sit and watch her father help me?

05:08.250 --> 05:09.125
And you.

05:10.083 --> 05:12.375
What will people say
about Pastor's daughter?

05:15.041 --> 05:16.833
You have to tell her you made me do it.

05:19.041 --> 05:20.416
You must be raving mad.

05:20.500 --> 05:24.083
Please.
Please, this is my life.

05:25.375 --> 05:27.750
My-- Our future.

05:28.458 --> 05:31.833
I will tell Carmen about us
the day I get the grant.

05:33.791 --> 05:34.958
Please.

05:38.041 --> 05:39.083
Yeah?

05:43.500 --> 05:44.541
Thank you.

06:07.916 --> 06:08.958
Move.

06:13.708 --> 06:15.583
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

06:17.083 --> 06:17.958
Mum…

06:19.791 --> 06:20.625
Who is this?

06:21.125 --> 06:22.500
This is the girl you ran over.

06:28.166 --> 06:29.291
Uh…

06:29.375 --> 06:31.708
She's had eight surgeries.

06:34.208 --> 06:38.458
While you're out there
gallivanting like there's no tomorrow,

06:38.541 --> 06:40.583
partying, drinking,

06:42.000 --> 06:45.500
remember that Gift here cannot socialize

06:45.583 --> 06:47.583
because of your actions.

06:48.416 --> 06:51.875
Your father is paying through the nose
to cover your sins.

06:52.875 --> 06:56.250
Atlas, despite everything,
still puts you first!

06:58.833 --> 07:02.166
You're grounded
from now till further notice.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.791
Home, school, and back home.

07:04.875 --> 07:08.208
I don't want to see
your stupid friends in my home.

07:08.791 --> 07:10.291
None of them.

07:10.375 --> 07:12.125
Even Atlas and Nnenna.

07:12.208 --> 07:13.375
Understood?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.375
-Sorry.

07:30.333 --> 07:31.666
What is wrong with Ishaya?

07:31.750 --> 07:34.041
Why's he just causing
trouble for everybody like this?

07:35.041 --> 07:36.916
Maybe if I got him customers,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.208
he could paint
and raise money to pay me back.

07:39.291 --> 07:42.125
We can't reach him
since the landlord brought the letter.

07:42.208 --> 07:45.041
-Did he not answer?
-His number isn't reachable.

07:45.125 --> 07:47.000
So how will we reach him before Friday?

07:51.166 --> 07:52.750
-Rahila.
-Hmm?

07:52.833 --> 07:53.875
Please.

07:54.583 --> 07:56.708
Could you go to Wilmer tomorrow?

07:57.708 --> 07:58.583
Alone?

07:59.666 --> 08:02.666
I would have gone with you,
but look at my face.

08:03.625 --> 08:04.541
Sorry.

08:05.125 --> 08:07.250
Thank you.

08:24.291 --> 08:25.375
Hey, I'm sorry, ma.

08:25.458 --> 08:28.583
-Madam said no friends allowed.
-What do you mean, "no friends allowed"?

08:28.666 --> 08:31.833
-Open the gate, please!
-I'm very sorry, that's the instruction.

08:32.541 --> 08:34.166
Excuse me, please.

08:34.250 --> 08:35.250
What the heck?

08:40.416 --> 08:42.833
<i>The number</i>
<i>you have dialed cannot be reached.</i>

08:42.916 --> 08:44.541
<i>-Please try again later.</i>
-Fuck.

08:52.916 --> 08:55.375
Much better. This is more like it.

08:55.458 --> 08:58.625
Frank,
I hope you like this one.

08:58.708 --> 08:59.625
Good afternoon ma.

09:00.625 --> 09:03.500
Ah! Ishaya, Ishaya, our best friend.

09:03.583 --> 09:04.791
Good afternoon, ma.

09:05.875 --> 09:08.000
Frank says you can draw, and I can see it!

09:08.083 --> 09:11.125
-Thank you.
-Your parents must be so proud.

09:13.041 --> 09:14.333
I hope you like snacks.

09:14.416 --> 09:16.666
I brought plenty snacks.

09:16.750 --> 09:20.916
People love the meat pie the most.
People ask me for the secret ingredient,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.875
but if I shared,
how would I have opened Frankees?

09:23.958 --> 09:26.583
-What? Ma, you own Frankees?
-She does.

09:26.666 --> 09:27.500
Wow.

09:27.583 --> 09:28.500
Um…

09:30.250 --> 09:32.083
-I have to go.
-Okay, ma.

09:32.166 --> 09:34.125
Be good. Enjoy yourselves.

09:34.208 --> 09:35.916
-Bye-bye.
-Bye, Mum.

09:38.625 --> 09:39.541
Wow.

09:40.125 --> 09:41.375
Your mum owns Frankees.

09:41.916 --> 09:42.750
Please.

09:53.666 --> 09:54.541
Carmen.

09:55.125 --> 09:56.166
Uh…

09:59.541 --> 10:02.291
-What's wrong with Carmen?
-Wait, you haven't seen the video?

10:02.375 --> 10:04.000
-Here, look.
-What video?

10:06.500 --> 10:07.625
Uh…

10:09.833 --> 10:12.250
-She has a boyfriend, remember?

10:12.333 --> 10:14.958
Who is walking directly towards us.

10:30.041 --> 10:32.208
I left something for you in your locker.

10:32.291 --> 10:35.791
It used to be my locker.
Someone forgot to change the code.

10:42.625 --> 10:43.791
That's 10K.

10:43.875 --> 10:44.916
Delete the video.

10:48.875 --> 10:50.208
One million.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.791
-Huh?
-Yeah.

10:52.875 --> 10:55.708
One million naira,
or I press play for Carmen.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.333
So what did he say?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.750
He said he wants one million naira.

11:10.833 --> 11:13.375
One million naira? Is he mad?

11:16.416 --> 11:17.541
Ugh.

11:31.166 --> 11:32.750
-Ishaya!

11:35.375 --> 11:36.250
Hmm.

11:36.916 --> 11:37.875
There you are.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.291
So…

11:48.958 --> 11:50.208
What do you say?

11:52.083 --> 11:53.250
"What do you say?"

11:54.500 --> 11:55.541
Please.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.541
Look at how you're disgracing yourself.

12:02.541 --> 12:04.666
Over someone that won't date you openly.

12:04.750 --> 12:05.958
Excuse you!

12:07.166 --> 12:08.458
Atlas loves me.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Sure.

12:11.875 --> 12:13.375
And my father is Bill Gates.

12:14.958 --> 12:16.208
Shame on you.

12:23.916 --> 12:26.041
-Good morning, ma'am.
-Good morning.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.583
Please, I'm looking for a student,
Ishaya Bello.

12:28.666 --> 12:31.333
Go and see the executive secretary,
Ms. Abubakar.

12:31.416 --> 12:32.583
Do you know her office?

12:33.083 --> 12:35.000
-Yes, ma, thank you.
-Welcome.

12:39.333 --> 12:40.791
Aw, are you serious?

12:46.750 --> 12:47.708
Thank you.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.041
Good morning, ma.

12:51.583 --> 12:52.666
I'll call you back.

12:55.125 --> 12:56.583
For the cleaning job, right?

12:56.666 --> 12:59.166
Fill this form,
take it next door and submit it there.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.166
No, I'm here to see my brother.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.458
He's a student here. Ishaya Bello.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.750
Sit down. I'll call him.

13:07.833 --> 13:09.458
Is this for the shortlist?

13:09.541 --> 13:11.708
You should use a blending stump for that.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.875
Please, can I use the toilet?

13:36.291 --> 13:38.208
Go outside, turn left,
you'll see it there.

13:38.291 --> 13:39.708
Thank you.

13:41.208 --> 13:42.166
And, please,

13:42.833 --> 13:45.333
don't touch anything
that doesn't belong to you.

13:48.416 --> 13:51.291
Yes. Hi, is Ishaya Bello there?

14:02.083 --> 14:03.125
My God.

14:07.958 --> 14:09.333
Sorry, sorry.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.583
-Sorry, sorry, sorry!

14:18.583 --> 14:19.583
Sorry.

14:21.666 --> 14:23.625
I've read the book, like, a million times.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.083
Me too.

14:27.375 --> 14:28.791
-Nice.
-Yeah.

14:30.416 --> 14:32.875
-All right.
-Are you a new student?

14:33.833 --> 14:35.875
No, I came to see my brother,
Ishaya Bello.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.958
Really? He's my roommate!

14:38.041 --> 14:39.041
Shh!

14:45.750 --> 14:48.750
Do you want to see
the rest of the library?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.250
Maybe
after I've seen Ishaya first.

14:53.333 --> 14:54.916
Yeah.

14:55.875 --> 14:57.041
I can take you to him.

14:57.125 --> 14:58.625
He's in art class.

14:58.708 --> 15:00.250
-Okay.
-Frank.

15:02.625 --> 15:03.666
Rahila.

15:04.708 --> 15:05.708
Rahila.

15:14.375 --> 15:17.083
Yeah,
and then the fact that he was just…

15:17.166 --> 15:18.875
Ishaya, we were coming to see you.

15:18.958 --> 15:22.166
I knew this is where you'd be.
Frank, I'll see you later.

15:23.125 --> 15:24.500
-Bye.
-Bye.

15:29.083 --> 15:29.958
Uh-huh?

15:31.375 --> 15:33.083
Why did you off your phone?

15:33.166 --> 15:34.958
I didn't turn it off,
it's broken.

15:35.041 --> 15:36.166
-Really?
-Yes.

15:36.250 --> 15:39.083
You know they hit Mike in the face
'cause he hasn't repaid them?

15:43.875 --> 15:45.750
-Hope he's okay.
-How will he be?

15:46.708 --> 15:49.541
Just come draw something.
Mike has already got customers.

15:49.625 --> 15:50.625
I'm busy now.

15:50.708 --> 15:52.541
I'll tell him
to send you a message on Blink.

15:52.625 --> 15:55.125
Draw plenty because
the landlord has given us a letter.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.708
Shit.

16:11.125 --> 16:13.208
Her dress is beautiful.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.208
It will be easy to remove while dancing.

16:16.708 --> 16:17.583
-Really?
-Yes.

16:17.666 --> 16:20.333
She is one of my customers at the salon.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.208
I trust her.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.500
If that's what you want.

16:35.416 --> 16:37.041
-Joe.
-Hmm?

16:37.125 --> 16:39.791
Get me Chinese rice
from that place on the next street.

16:39.875 --> 16:40.791
I am busy.

16:42.583 --> 16:43.750
Busy doing what?

16:45.291 --> 16:46.541
Chinese rice, right?

16:46.625 --> 16:47.916
Mmm. Fufu.

16:53.416 --> 16:54.833
-Adufe.
-Mmm?

16:54.916 --> 16:57.875
I have told you,
quit your salon job.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.500
Come and work in my palace.

17:03.833 --> 17:04.875
But as what?

17:09.000 --> 17:11.333
<i>Why the fuck</i>
<i>do we need a coordinator?</i>

17:11.416 --> 17:13.458
Focus on your drugs

17:14.666 --> 17:16.291
while she and I hold down the fort.

17:20.958 --> 17:21.916
Sit.

17:27.791 --> 17:29.958
-Are you okay?
-Both of you, leave us.

17:45.250 --> 17:46.833
Let me go and eat my food.

17:54.750 --> 17:55.625
Listen.

17:56.916 --> 17:59.833
I'm not saying this as
your business partner, but as your friend.

18:00.375 --> 18:02.291
-Kasali, this is--
-Enough!

18:05.791 --> 18:06.833
That's final!

18:08.958 --> 18:09.958
It's an order.

18:12.208 --> 18:13.500
Tell all the staff.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.666
She's in charge now.

18:21.625 --> 18:24.125
-One, two, three, let's go!

18:29.791 --> 18:33.000
We attack as a unit,
and we defend as a unit.

18:33.083 --> 18:34.791
-You understand?
-Yes, coach!

18:34.875 --> 18:37.250
Well done, guys.
Nice work. Well done, well done.

18:38.125 --> 18:39.125
Okay!

18:39.208 --> 18:40.083
Hey.

18:40.166 --> 18:41.791
-How is it?
-It's good.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.291
-Thank you.
-Clean!

18:47.375 --> 18:49.375
One, two, three, let's go!

18:49.458 --> 18:51.833
-I saw the alert. Thanks.
-Got you.

18:53.041 --> 18:55.041
Do you know any other person
that wants to buy?

18:55.125 --> 18:56.916
'Cause I need to sell all this shit fast.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.333
Why don't you just sell it on Blink?

18:59.416 --> 19:00.791
-Really?
-Yeah.

19:00.875 --> 19:03.458
So I could get into trouble
with the police, right?

19:03.958 --> 19:06.125
Just set up
an anonymous account.

19:11.416 --> 19:13.041
Wow, look at that.

19:13.125 --> 19:14.958
-I'm sorry.

19:15.041 --> 19:16.708
I love you so much, babe.

19:17.250 --> 19:18.500
Please forgive me.

19:23.500 --> 19:26.125
-Get your girl, boy!

19:28.083 --> 19:29.083
I've got it.

19:29.708 --> 19:32.250
If I sell on Blink
with a fake name,

19:32.333 --> 19:35.791
and ask people to put the money
in their lockers, give me their codes,

19:36.583 --> 19:38.500
I drop the molly, pick the money.

19:38.583 --> 19:39.958
What do you think?

19:42.125 --> 19:44.000
-Let me know when you set up.
-Sure.

20:34.125 --> 20:35.166
Thank you.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.791
So you won't go back to work now
until you pay?

20:39.750 --> 20:41.458
It's the best thing to do.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.958
Otherwise,
they slap my face with a spanner.

20:46.416 --> 20:49.041
Michael! You lied to the boss
that you're sick, right?

20:49.125 --> 20:50.458
Open this door now!

20:52.125 --> 20:53.166
Not here…

21:01.625 --> 21:03.500
-Please, leave.
-No!

21:03.583 --> 21:06.875
Please. I'll be all right, just head home.

21:09.208 --> 21:11.958
Tuesday… Tuesday, please.

21:15.666 --> 21:17.625
Another day, another blow.

21:17.708 --> 21:19.708
-Please.
-Tuesday, please!

21:21.125 --> 21:22.750
Where is my money, Michael?

21:22.833 --> 21:24.458
Tuesday, please!

21:24.541 --> 21:27.666
Where is my money? I will deal with you.
I will kill you today.

21:27.750 --> 21:30.416
-Where's my money? Huh?
-I will get you your money, please!

21:34.833 --> 21:37.541
MICHAEL
What's wrong with your phone?

22:35.708 --> 22:37.541
What are you
doing in my locker?

22:56.291 --> 22:57.333
Um…

23:13.375 --> 23:15.416
The three forms
of non-finite verbs are…

23:15.500 --> 23:19.291
-Ishaya!

23:19.375 --> 23:21.166
That will be all for today.

23:31.916 --> 23:33.708
Ishaya, we need to talk.

23:34.333 --> 23:35.666
I've been texting you.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.708
Carmen, I don't have
anything to say to you.

23:43.000 --> 23:43.958
Really?

23:45.333 --> 23:46.333
We should--

23:54.416 --> 23:55.625
Carmen, give me my book.

23:55.708 --> 23:57.333
Reply to my messages.

24:05.333 --> 24:08.208
Okay, spill.
What's going on with you and Carmen?

24:08.291 --> 24:10.333
Guys, it's nothing.

24:10.416 --> 24:11.916
"It's nothing."

24:12.000 --> 24:14.625
-What's wrong with you?

24:14.708 --> 24:16.625
-You saw she collected my book.
-Mmm-hmm.

24:16.708 --> 24:18.125
I just want to collect my book back.

24:18.208 --> 24:19.666
-You want to collect--
-My book.

24:20.250 --> 24:23.125
-My sketchbook, Zina.
-You want to collect!

24:23.208 --> 24:25.833
-Ishaya, you want to collect!
-What? My sketchbook!

24:26.333 --> 24:28.291
-The sketchbook we're talking--
-Ishaya.

24:31.916 --> 24:34.000
Yeah, he's my… uncle.

24:34.083 --> 24:35.458
Good afternoon, sir.

24:39.750 --> 24:42.208
Um, I'll see you guys later, all right?

24:44.083 --> 24:45.500
"It's nothing."

24:45.583 --> 24:47.125
Ishaya's problematic.

24:47.208 --> 24:48.458
You sold everything?

24:52.250 --> 24:53.750
Let me check your phone.

24:55.291 --> 24:57.250
My phone is bad.

24:57.333 --> 25:00.500
But if we get to an ATM machine,
I can show you.

25:01.250 --> 25:04.041
Well, if you're not lying,
I'll get you a new phone.

25:06.250 --> 25:07.166
Are you serious?

25:08.541 --> 25:10.458
Is it… Is it an iPhone?

26:22.166 --> 26:24.166
-Okada!

26:36.000 --> 26:38.166
-Well, where is it?

26:39.125 --> 26:40.541
-Jesus!

26:46.458 --> 26:48.000
You're scared of horses.

26:48.541 --> 26:49.375
No.

26:49.958 --> 26:52.333
It's just a horse,
why would I be scared?

26:52.416 --> 26:54.166
-Hmm!
-It's not serious.

26:54.250 --> 26:55.458
Look behind you.

26:56.541 --> 26:58.208
Jesus.

26:58.291 --> 27:00.375
Stop shouting. You'll scare her.

27:01.791 --> 27:05.500
Carmen, let me out of here.
Are you recording? Stop now.

27:05.583 --> 27:07.500
Carmen, stop now.
Stop recording now. Stop it.

27:07.583 --> 27:09.458
Just promise
you won't tell anyone about it.

27:09.541 --> 27:12.458
I swear on my late
brother's life, just let me out of here.

27:12.541 --> 27:13.541
Please.

27:14.833 --> 27:15.666
Please.

27:22.708 --> 27:24.541
I didn't know your brother died.

27:25.125 --> 27:26.166
I'm so sorry.

27:26.833 --> 27:28.208
It's fine.

27:41.916 --> 27:44.291
Meet my horse, Sapphire.

27:49.083 --> 27:50.166
It's fine.

27:56.958 --> 28:00.458
If you keep my secret,
I won't tell anyone you're Dr. High.

28:01.541 --> 28:02.375
Deal?

28:07.000 --> 28:09.208
-Ahh!

28:09.291 --> 28:10.750
Sorry.

28:10.833 --> 28:12.291
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

28:23.416 --> 28:25.291
So…

28:27.541 --> 28:29.041
How did

28:30.250 --> 28:31.375
your brother die?

28:43.041 --> 28:45.250
-It was raining.

28:46.375 --> 28:48.666
-Big boy!

28:49.375 --> 28:51.333
<i>He and my dad were on a bike.</i>

28:51.416 --> 28:53.541
I'll be there soon.

28:53.625 --> 28:55.625
You're holding a lot.
Let him stay with me.

28:55.708 --> 28:57.791
No, there's enough room.
Quick, we need to go.

28:57.875 --> 29:00.625
I need to deliver this art,
my client's waiting.

29:04.541 --> 29:07.333
- <i>A bus ran into them.</i>

29:14.666 --> 29:16.125
I'm sorry to hear that.

29:20.458 --> 29:21.333
It's fine.

29:22.916 --> 29:26.166
I don't like to talk about it,
I don't even know why I told you.

29:32.583 --> 29:34.000
Why are you using molly?

29:38.208 --> 29:39.833
Why are you selling it?

29:46.875 --> 29:48.458
MICHAEL
Ishaya, where are you!!!

29:50.541 --> 29:53.166
-I'm sorry, I need to go.
-It's okay.

29:53.250 --> 29:54.916
Thank you for the drinks.

30:01.166 --> 30:02.166
My sketchbook.

30:04.041 --> 30:04.916
Thank you.

30:07.166 --> 30:08.166
Bye.

30:08.250 --> 30:10.416
Oh! Your secret is safe with me.

30:19.791 --> 30:22.625
-Mike!

30:22.708 --> 30:25.375
Guy, I saw a live horse today.
Not in a movie…

30:25.458 --> 30:28.041
-Mike.

30:29.458 --> 30:30.375
What happened?

30:31.708 --> 30:33.833
Oh, I… I have the money.

30:33.916 --> 30:36.541
-I just rushed to see Carmen.
-Drop the money.

30:37.208 --> 30:38.250
Drop my key.

30:38.916 --> 30:40.708
Why are you
asking me for your key?

30:40.791 --> 30:42.166
'Cause you're selfish.

30:42.958 --> 30:45.375
The only person
you think about is yourself.

30:46.625 --> 30:49.500
Mike, I know you're angry,
but, please, just listen…

30:52.916 --> 30:55.500
Because of your selfishness,
someone could die.

30:57.041 --> 30:58.125
Like Dauda.

31:00.833 --> 31:03.791
I don't want to die,
so drop my key and get out.

31:06.208 --> 31:07.083
Mike.

32:21.791 --> 32:26.000
I would have sold everything this week,
but it's just that the medicine…

32:26.583 --> 32:27.750
The molly…

32:34.125 --> 32:35.250
Good evening, sir.

32:36.750 --> 32:38.625
I'm here to collect a new batch.

32:46.666 --> 32:48.416
Joe, give him the rest of your own.

32:50.583 --> 32:53.250
Boss, don't worry,
I'll sell everything.

32:53.333 --> 32:54.541
I'll sell it…

33:00.541 --> 33:02.458
-Ahh! Ahh!

33:08.916 --> 33:10.750
Three weeks for this one.

33:22.875 --> 33:25.416
All I need you
to do today is focus.

33:25.500 --> 33:26.625
Pass the ball.

33:26.708 --> 33:28.708
-Ishaya.

33:29.291 --> 33:32.458
Let's go, Bulldogs!
Let's go, Bulldogs!

33:33.125 --> 33:34.791
Let's go get 'em all!

33:34.875 --> 33:37.083
-Who are we?
-Wildcats!

33:37.166 --> 33:39.208
-What do we do?
-Win!

33:39.291 --> 33:40.291
One, two, three!

34:10.791 --> 34:12.291
Hey! Hey, mark him! Mark him!

34:15.791 --> 34:17.041
Forward, forward, forward!

34:27.791 --> 34:28.833
Reggie!

34:53.041 --> 34:55.333
-Oh, my good--
-Fire!

34:57.375 --> 34:59.000
-Take your shirt away!

35:00.250 --> 35:02.166
-Spray that!

35:05.250 --> 35:07.541
-It's getting lit, bro.
-Get out.

35:07.625 --> 35:09.000
Fire! Get out of here!

35:09.500 --> 35:11.708
-I'm out of here!

35:23.875 --> 35:25.208
<i>Oh</i>,<i> my God.</i>

35:43.833 --> 35:47.125
Fire!
