Well, it's rare that a coyote
will attack a human being.

04:32.709 --> 04:34.109
Well, they say that
there's a new predator

04:34.144 --> 04:36.211
that they're calling a Coywolf.

04:36.246 --> 04:38.213
It's a mix of Canis latrans
and Canis lupus.

04:38.248 --> 04:41.149
It's a hybrid coyote-wolf.

04:41.185 --> 04:43.438
Is this the first such attack?

But, uh...

04:47.979 --> 04:50.725
let me ask you,
what's the FBI doing here?

04:50.761 --> 04:52.561
The FBI has jurisdiction over the killing

04:52.596 --> 04:55.230

of a law enforcement officer.

04:58.851 --> 05:00.150
Wait.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.673
You think that this was a murder?

05:01.708 --> 05:04.573
- I don't rule it out.
- What makes you say that?

05:04.608 --> 05:07.778
I know this is a small town,
and probably very close-knit,

05:07.813 --> 05:09.678
and I'm sure that you
don't want to hear this.

05:09.713 --> 05:13.117
But if a man did this... and
it would typically be a man...

05:13.152 --> 05:15.789
he would be emboldened
by escaping detection

05:15.824 --> 05:18.215
- and would likely kill again.
- The evidence

05:18.250 --> 05:20.755
- doesn't support that.
- Well, the broken neck supports that.

05:20.791 --> 05:22.724
And the bite marks that you see

05:22.759 --> 05:25.560
might be postmortem animal predation.

Agent Scully's also a medical doctor,

05:32.402 --> 05:34.169
and damn good at her job.

05:35.485 --> 05:37.706
SCULLY: You'd be looking
at a male, age 19 to 42,

05:37.741 --> 05:39.174
with a criminal record.

05:39.209 --> 05:41.576

hasn't been seen in Connecticut

- for a hundred years.
- Just last year, to be accurate.

06:13.809 --> 06:15.575
SCULLY: All that I took from the report

06:15.611 --> 06:18.246
is that a child was snatched,
right from that playground.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.786
Does that sound like a wolf to you?

06:20.821 --> 06:22.339
No, I wasn't thinking wolf.

06:22.374 --> 06:23.852
I was thinking more like a hellhound.

06:27.162 --> 06:29.815
- What's a hellhound, now?
- It's a large black dog

06:29.840 --> 06:31.265
that guards the gates of the underworld.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.465
But that's neither here nor there.

06:32.501 --> 06:33.767
The point is that stranger things

06:33.802 --> 06:35.135
have happened around here, Scully.

06:35.170 --> 06:37.871
In 1658, a Puritan midwife
named Goodie Bishop

06:37.906 --> 06:40.707
was accused of witchcraft
and lying with the devil.

06:40.742 --> 06:43.543
Legend has it that
she spontaneously combusted

06:43.578 --> 06:45.879
in front of the assembled townsfolk.

06:45.914 --> 06:48.114
- Right over there.
- Well, as we've discussed before,

06:48.150 --> 06:50.784
people don't just spontaneously
combust, and that woman

06:50.819 --> 06:53.253
was undoubtedly an innocent,
a tragic victim

06:53.288 --> 06:55.584
of religious persecution and hysteria,

06:55.619 --> 06:57.539
and anybody would know that if they read

06:57.574 --> 06:59.427
- beyond the tourist literature.
- Because there were

06:59.462 --> 07:01.594
bogus witch hunts doesn't mean
that there were no witches.

07:02.440 --> 07:03.796
And while I do sadly concede

07:03.832 --> 07:05.265
that there are probably no Coywolves

07:05.300 --> 07:07.267
in Eastwood, Connecticut, I do suspect

07:07.302 --> 07:09.569
there are still practitioners
of the black arts.

07:09.604 --> 07:10.937
Well, they can practice all they want,

07:10.972 --> 07:12.138
but it doesn't mean that witchcraft

07:12.174 --> 07:14.107
- has any basis in reality.
- Well...

07:14.142 --> 07:17.277
and yet, a young boy is dead.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.746
Mulder, the only devil around
here probably parks right here

07:19.781 --> 07:21.681
in front of the playground,

07:21.717 --> 07:23.383
stirring something other
than his cauldron.

07:24.453 --> 07:26.286
Huh.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.521
I just want to find the killer.

07:33.019 --> 07:35.095
No matter how many times
we do this, Mulder,

07:35.130 --> 07:37.430

07:37.899 --> 07:39.532
(WHISPERS): It never gets easier.

07:39.568 --> 07:41.334
It's an innocent life cut short.

07:41.369 --> 07:43.536
It's hard not to take it personally.

07:58.353 --> 08:01.287
Irregular lacerations and abrasions

08:01.323 --> 08:03.490
on the neck, throat and torso.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.291
Significant...

08:05.327 --> 08:08.728
amount of the lower abdomen is...

08:08.764 --> 08:11.498
completely torn out and missing.

08:11.533 --> 08:14.701
That would appear to agree
with their findings.

08:14.736 --> 08:16.503
Well, evisceration fits animal predation,

08:16.538 --> 08:18.972
but the condition of the body
makes it almost impossible

08:19.007 --> 08:20.707
to determine when it happened.

08:20.742 --> 08:23.042
Cervical fracturing fits with the picture

08:23.078 --> 08:26.146

most probably shaken to death.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.049
Well, that's...

08:30.085 --> 08:32.852

to broach out there, Mulder.

08:32.888 --> 08:35.321
You think it's one of the parents.

on that young boy's body,
but you hid that fact,

26:02.571 --> 26:04.605
a fact you knew would reveal

26:04.640 --> 26:06.206
that someone was practicing witchcraft.

26:06.242 --> 26:07.441
Mulder.

26:07.476 --> 26:08.884
STRONG: No, it's...

26:10.913 --> 26:12.385
It's okay. He's right.

26:12.420 --> 26:14.353
You ought to take a beat, Chief,

26:14.388 --> 26:16.350
before you say anything else.

26:21.924 --> 26:23.590
Did you kill those children?

26:30.933 --> 26:34.067
I have let the devil into my soul

26:34.103 --> 26:37.537
and I have sinned against God,

26:38.414 --> 26:42.009
broken a sacred commandment,
but I did not kill anyone,

26:42.044 --> 26:43.633
especially not Emily.

26:43.669 --> 26:45.679
Then what's your part in all this?

26:45.714 --> 26:50.584
(SIGHS) I am a...

26:50.619 --> 26:52.019
lustful man.

26:52.054 --> 26:53.679
An adulterer.

26:54.623 --> 26:56.590
She wanted to end the relationship,

26:56.625 --> 27:00.927
but I wouldn't let her;
I kept pushing and pushing.

27:00.963 --> 27:03.563
I was on the phone with her
when Andrew went missing.

27:03.599 --> 27:06.533
And now...

27:06.568 --> 27:08.535
my own daughter.

27:08.570 --> 27:12.005
God. What have I done?

27:12.041 --> 27:15.427
(CRYING) See, I'm being punished.

27:15.462 --> 27:17.744
I've opened the gates of hell.

27:20.482 --> 27:22.049
Oh, God.

27:22.084 --> 27:23.984
Let's all give him some room.

27:28.991 --> 27:30.724
How did you know, Mulder?

27:30.759 --> 27:32.914
I... did not see that coming.

27:32.950 --> 27:34.567
But you knew something.

27:34.603 --> 27:37.064
Yeah. In his library,
there are all these books

27:37.099 --> 27:39.640
on the town's history...
folklore, witchcraft.

27:39.676 --> 27:41.968
Well, that's circumstantial at best.

27:42.004 --> 27:44.357
I'm sure lots of libraries
in this town have those books.

27:44.393 --> 27:46.873
Yes, but he would have known
about magic salt circles

27:46.909 --> 27:48.630
and familiars and hellhounds.

27:48.630 --> 27:51.698
So you think Chief Strong
unleashed something?

27:51.733 --> 27:54.600
I think someone has put a curse
on this town, Scully,

27:54.636 --> 27:57.370
and maybe unwittingly opened
the gates of hell.

You may be seated.

29:43.210 --> 29:45.810
I fear emotions are running high today,

29:45.845 --> 29:49.415
so I'd like to ask everyone
to respect the seriousness

29:49.450 --> 29:51.449
of our jobs at this arraignment.

29:51.484 --> 29:53.885
I'll ask respective counsels to approach.

30:02.162 --> 30:04.963
(WHISPERING): There will be
two injustices here:

30:04.998 --> 30:08.380
the death of an innocent man and
the release of a guilty officer.

30:09.696 --> 30:11.302
(WHISPERING):
What makes you so sure, Mulder?

30:11.338 --> 30:13.071
It's small town justice.

30:13.106 --> 30:14.839
They have their scapegoat,
their predator.

30:14.874 --> 30:17.575
SCULLY: We've witnessed
mass hysteria and mob violence

30:17.611 --> 30:22.347
at its worst, but I'm not
so sure about an innocent man.

30:22.382 --> 30:24.082
This is a witch hunt.

30:24.117 --> 30:26.517
I think the person or persons
responsible for the deaths

30:26.553 --> 30:28.886
of those children
is in this courtroom today.

30:30.890 --> 30:32.759
What happened to hounds of hell?

30:32.795 --> 30:34.281
Oh, I saw one.

30:35.095 --> 30:37.428
- Mm-hmm.
- I did.

30:38.898 --> 30:42.030
Whatever you think
you may have seen, Mulder,

30:42.066 --> 30:45.360
you still haven't explained how
a wolf can take a young child

30:45.385 --> 30:47.285
- from under its mother's nose.
- Oh, no, it was, it was...

30:47.320 --> 30:48.786
he was just guarding the entrance

30:48.822 --> 30:50.655
to the underworld in this case.

30:50.690 --> 30:52.657
JUDGE BROWN: Return to your tables.

30:52.692 --> 30:54.859
(WHISPERING): You still haven't
answered my question.

30:54.894 --> 30:56.728
Mr. Eggers.

30:57.464 --> 30:59.864
Due to your exemplary record
as an officer

30:59.899 --> 31:01.866
of the Eastwood Police Department,

31:01.901 --> 31:04.402
the testimony of your peers
and in determining

31:04.437 --> 31:05.703
you are not a flight risk,

31:05.739 --> 31:08.700
bail will be set at $5,000.

31:08.735 --> 31:11.142
Next court date is 30 days from today.

31:11.177 --> 31:12.910
Court is adjourned.

31:27.393 --> 31:31.129
Looks like somebody wants to talk to us.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.836
Agent Scully, Agent Mulder.

31:38.872 --> 31:40.171
SCULLY: Officer Wentworth.

31:40.206 --> 31:42.173
You missed the proceedings.

31:42.208 --> 31:43.775
I'm sickened how things turned out.

31:43.810 --> 31:45.676
I didn't become a cop to watch a man

31:45.712 --> 31:47.445
get gunned down without due process.

31:47.480 --> 31:50.100
So I went out and did some digging.

31:53.920 --> 31:55.353
The day Andrew disappeared,

31:55.388 --> 31:56.888
Melvin was performing at a birthday party

31:56.923 --> 31:58.856
40 miles from here.

31:58.892 --> 32:00.224
I checked with his client.

32:00.260 --> 32:01.728
They have him on video.

32:01.763 --> 32:04.462
The encoded time stamp
places him there at 2:15 p.m.,

32:04.497 --> 32:07.198
right when Andrew disappeared.

32:07.233 --> 32:09.567
There's no way he could
have been in that park.

32:09.602 --> 32:11.903
Have you told anybody else about this?

32:11.938 --> 32:15.540
I told Chief Strong,
but he didn't want to hear it.

32:15.575 --> 32:19.076
He told me to let sleeping dogs lie.

32:19.112 --> 32:21.045
I-I don't think
the chief's head's been right

32:21.080 --> 32:22.456
since he lost little Emily.

32:22.492 --> 32:24.282
No, you did the right thing.

32:24.317 --> 32:26.045
The town won't see it that way.

32:26.081 --> 32:29.014

on injustices...

32:30.523 --> 32:32.809
especially in this part of the country.

32:33.960 --> 32:35.993
But we're not done here yet.

32:36.563 --> 32:38.899
I sure would like to find that killer.

32:39.465 --> 32:40.932
See him get what's coming to him.

32:42.841 --> 32:44.374
MULDER: We'll talk to Chief Strong.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.603
You think I didn't know?

32:53.330 --> 32:55.847
It's over, Rick. I called it off.

for that now.

No, no. You may have
tapped into something

40:58.841 --> 41:01.476
- you can't control. Anna!
- (CONTINUES CHANTING)

41:01.511 --> 41:02.911
...ad inferos!

41:04.681 --> 41:06.414
(ANNA SCREAMING)

41:17.728 --> 41:19.160
(WOLF GROWLING)

41:35.212 --> 41:37.178
(SIREN WAILING)

41:40.584 --> 41:43.518
Somehow, this didn't burn.

41:49.860 --> 41:51.259
What'd you tell him?

41:52.076 --> 41:54.461
To consider that book as evidence.

41:54.496 --> 41:56.441
Huh. Evidence of what, exactly?

41:56.477 --> 41:59.401
Of a town in the grip of madness.

41:59.436 --> 42:02.404
Of the most human faults and frailty.

42:02.439 --> 42:05.740
Or in the grip of a curse,
unleashed by a modern-day witch.

42:06.507 --> 42:09.544
Leave that to
the tourist literature, Mulder.

42:10.447 --> 42:13.959
(SIGHS) I just hope that it's over.

42:13.984 --> 42:16.651
I only hope that it is, too.

42:24.628 --> 42:26.761
That woman went up in flames.

42:28.298 --> 42:30.565
Maybe it was the candles.

42:31.199 --> 42:33.334
Maybe it was the gates of hell.

42:37.174 --> 42:39.574
Let's get out of this town, Mulder.

42:39.609 --> 42:41.876
There is no getting out
of this town, Scully.

42:41.912 --> 42:43.812
Not these days.
