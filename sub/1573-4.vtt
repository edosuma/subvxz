<b>6x04 - "Orders"</b>

00:22.821 --> 00:24.948
<i>Clone crisis!</i>

00:24.990 --> 00:27.617
<i>After the mysterious death
of his friend Tup,</i>

00:27.659 --> 00:30.453
<i>ARC trooper Fives embarked
on an investigation,</i>

00:30.495 --> 00:32.747
<i>which led to the discovery
of a hidden chip</i>

00:32.789 --> 00:34.624
<i>which is placed
inside clone troopers</i>

00:34.666 --> 00:37.002
<i>when they are still embryos.</i>

00:37.044 --> 00:40.297
<i>The Kaminoan scientist Nala Se
claims the chip is harmless</i>

00:40.339 --> 00:42.132
<i>and is meant to restrain the clones</i>

00:42.174 --> 00:44.467
<i>from violent, unpredictable action.</i>

00:44.509 --> 00:46.845
<i>Fives claims otherwise</i>

00:46.887 --> 00:48.847
<i>and has convinced
Jedi Master Shaak Ti</i>

00:48.889 --> 00:50.807
<i>to allow him
to plead his case directly</i>

00:50.849 --> 00:54.644
<i>to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine
on Coruscant.</i>

00:59.233 --> 01:00.734
Attention.

01:00.776 --> 01:02.444
Please be advised
we have arrived at Coruscant

01:02.485 --> 01:05.322
and will be touching down
at our destination shortly.

01:23.882 --> 01:25.926
No...

01:25.968 --> 01:27.386
Wait...

01:27.428 --> 01:28.678
Ugh!

01:28.720 --> 01:31.723
No.
What was that?

01:31.765 --> 01:33.267
What did you do?

01:33.309 --> 01:35.476
You drugged me.

01:35.518 --> 01:37.729
Shh.

02:00.919 --> 02:03.380
Greetings, Master Jedi.

02:03.422 --> 02:05.215
The Chancellor
is waiting inside.

02:06.467 --> 02:08.217
Tup...

02:08.259 --> 02:10.220
The mission...

02:10.262 --> 02:12.639
AZI-3...

02:22.732 --> 02:24.401
Master Shaak Ti,

02:24.443 --> 02:27.737
it is good
to see you again.

02:27.779 --> 02:32.075
I trust you've kept this matter
extremely confidential.

02:32.117 --> 02:34.036
Of course, Chancellor.

02:34.077 --> 02:35.996
Ah, good.

02:36.038 --> 02:39.916
So this is the clone
who has caused so much alarm?

02:41.960 --> 02:45.214
No, no,
you drugged me.

02:45.255 --> 02:46.798
She...

02:46.840 --> 02:50.260
There, there, soldier.
Don't strain yourself.

02:50.302 --> 02:51.928
Sir.

02:51.970 --> 02:55.391
Guards, let him down, please.

02:56.975 --> 03:01.313
Now, trooper,
what brings you before me?

03:01.355 --> 03:05.317
- The chips, Chancellor.
- Chips?

03:05.359 --> 03:08.611
These were removed
from both clone troopers.

03:08.653 --> 03:12.533
Clone trooper Fives claims they
are the cause of the problem.

03:12.573 --> 03:14.701
Those are inhibitor chips,

03:14.743 --> 03:17.246
which are placed in clones
to make them less aggressive

03:17.287 --> 03:19.289
and more compliant to orders.

03:19.331 --> 03:21.291
I tried to explain
to this clone

03:21.333 --> 03:23.793
that they are placed in them
for his own good,

03:23.835 --> 03:26.463
but he removed his chip
nonetheless.

03:26.505 --> 03:28.090
Our own good?

03:28.131 --> 03:30.342
This thing they put in us
malfunctioned

03:30.384 --> 03:31.885
in clone trooper Tup.

03:31.927 --> 03:34.304
I removed his and analyzed it.

03:34.346 --> 03:36.139
There were signs of rapid decay.

03:36.181 --> 03:41.311
And we're positive this
has nothing to do with a virus?

03:41.353 --> 03:43.772
No, we still do not know
for sure

03:43.813 --> 03:45.982
what caused trooper Tup to kill.

03:46.024 --> 03:47.984
We only know
that his chip failed,

03:48.026 --> 03:51.321
and now this clone
has removed his own chip,

03:51.363 --> 03:54.908
which makes him a risk
to himself and others.

03:54.950 --> 03:56.659
I'm not at risk.

03:56.701 --> 03:58.036
Sir, they're covering
something up.

03:58.078 --> 03:59.746
I know it.

03:59.788 --> 04:02.207
If it's not them,
then it's a Separatist plot.

04:02.249 --> 04:04.251
They use this chip
against us

04:04.293 --> 04:05.752
to make us more violent
than less.

04:05.794 --> 04:09.172
That's why Tup
killed General Tiplar!

04:09.214 --> 04:14.261
A Separatist plot from before
the war even started?

04:14.303 --> 04:18.599
That seems unlikely.
Don't you agree, Master Shaak Ti?

04:18.640 --> 04:22.269
It does, Chancellor.
It seems very unlikely.

04:22.311 --> 04:24.480
It is absolutely impossible.

04:24.521 --> 04:26.898
What we have here
is a single malfunction

04:26.940 --> 04:30.026
to one clone's inhibitor chip
caused by a virus,

04:30.068 --> 04:32.112
Separatist plot or not.

04:32.154 --> 04:36.241
Perhaps it would be best
if clone trooper Fives and I

04:36.283 --> 04:39.495
discussed this
without your presence.

04:39.536 --> 04:41.704
Chancellor,
I must object.

04:41.746 --> 04:45.083
Please, Master Jedi.
Trust me.

04:45.125 --> 04:47.336
I will not be alone.

04:47.377 --> 04:49.712
I have my security here.

04:49.754 --> 04:53.300
I want this soldier
to feel he is having a fair say

04:53.342 --> 04:55.218
in this matter.

05:06.771 --> 05:10.275
Now...

05:10.317 --> 05:12.902
where were we?

05:21.119 --> 05:22.912
 No!

05:22.954 --> 05:24.706
Let me go!

05:24.747 --> 05:26.375
Guards!

05:29.169 --> 05:30.920
No! You!

05:34.633 --> 05:36.801
He tried to kill me.

05:36.843 --> 05:38.470
It was so sudden.

05:44.393 --> 05:45.810
You were right, doctor.

05:45.852 --> 05:49.439
He must have gone mad
without his chip.

05:50.940 --> 05:54.486
You have done all you can,
Doctor.

05:54.528 --> 05:57.113
I trust you
will keep these safe?

05:57.155 --> 05:59.949
Of course, Chancellor.

06:09.167 --> 06:10.835
Fives, stop!

06:10.877 --> 06:12.337
Fives!

06:25.684 --> 06:27.394
Close the blast doors!

06:46.996 --> 06:48.957
I can't believe
Fives would try

06:48.998 --> 06:51.126
to assassinate
the Chancellor.

06:51.167 --> 06:53.128
The Kaminoans feel
a virus corrupted

06:53.169 --> 06:54.879
the clone's inhibitor chip,

06:54.921 --> 06:57.299
which has led
to this behavior.

06:57.340 --> 07:00.636
ARC trooper Fives feels
he is the victim of a plot,

07:00.677 --> 07:03.096
Separatist or otherwise.

07:03.138 --> 07:05.140
All security and clone forces
on Coruscant

07:05.181 --> 07:07.058
have been ordered
to join the manhunt.

07:07.100 --> 07:09.519
The Chancellor has been moved
to his Senate quarters,

07:09.561 --> 07:11.229
and the perimeter
has been secured.

07:11.271 --> 07:15.567
However, Jedi involvement
has not been requested.

07:15.609 --> 07:18.320
That's a little odd,
isn't it?

07:18.361 --> 07:19.571
Hmm.

07:19.613 --> 07:22.741
Discover the truth we must.

07:22.783 --> 07:25.160
If there is a plot
involving the clones,

07:25.201 --> 07:27.746
we must get
to the bottom of it.

07:27.788 --> 07:30.248
We will investigate quietly,
undercover.

07:30.290 --> 07:33.502
We must make sure
this clone is not killed.

07:33.543 --> 07:35.462
I'll handle
this investigation.

07:35.504 --> 07:37.464
Fives was part of the 501st,

07:37.506 --> 07:39.924
If Rex and I find him,
he'll trust us.

07:39.966 --> 07:41.926
Be wary.

07:41.968 --> 07:44.262
Since he removed
his inhibitor chip,

07:44.304 --> 07:48.016
Fives may no longer
be the man you once knew.

08:24.927 --> 08:25.887
Here you go.

08:25.928 --> 08:27.096
Thank you, ladies.

08:27.138 --> 08:29.057
Have a good time
on Coruscant, now.

08:29.098 --> 08:30.266
Thank you!

08:34.020 --> 08:35.856
Heya, pal. Where to?

08:35.897 --> 08:37.649
Take me to 79's.

08:37.691 --> 08:39.275
The clone bar?

08:39.317 --> 08:41.443
Oh, you're a clone, huh?

08:41.486 --> 08:43.196
Look, just shut up and drive!

08:43.238 --> 08:45.281
Okay, you got it.

08:59.128 --> 09:02.173
So headin' out for a little fun
on the town, eh?

09:02.215 --> 09:04.676
I didn't know clones
could have fun.

09:04.718 --> 09:07.178
There's a lot you don't know
about clones.

09:07.220 --> 09:08.847
No one knows.

09:08.889 --> 09:11.516
Ooh, very mysterious, eh?

09:11.558 --> 09:13.017
I like a good mystery.

09:13.059 --> 09:14.352
Yeah?

09:14.394 --> 09:15.771
You ever hear the one
about the people

09:15.812 --> 09:17.146
engineered to kill,

09:17.188 --> 09:18.815
engineered to kill
their best friends,

09:18.857 --> 09:19.941
their leaders,

09:19.982 --> 09:21.359
and they don't even know it?

09:21.401 --> 09:23.986
I'm a cab driver, pal.

09:24.028 --> 09:26.865
I hear stories like that
all the time.

09:47.343 --> 09:50.472
Hey, you payin'
for this ride or what?

09:50.513 --> 09:52.849
Ah, bill it to the Republic.

09:52.891 --> 09:54.643
Bill it to the Republic.

09:54.684 --> 09:56.185
Good one, brother!

09:56.227 --> 09:58.814
Lousy, cheap clones!

09:58.855 --> 10:00.440
It's your credit, pal.

10:00.482 --> 10:02.066
You're payin' for this.

10:04.193 --> 10:07.029
Ah, your mother's a droid!

10:08.615 --> 10:09.574
Get out of here!

10:09.616 --> 10:11.326
Droid lover!

10:11.367 --> 10:13.662
Come on, brother.
Let's go inside.

10:13.703 --> 10:16.205
Corporal, that's
a nice hat you got there.

10:16.247 --> 10:17.958
Mind if I see it?

10:17.999 --> 10:20.543
Uh, sure, yeah.
Sure, you got it.

10:23.672 --> 10:24.673
Hit it!

10:24.714 --> 10:25.841
You got it!

10:25.882 --> 10:27.049
To the Republic!

10:28.384 --> 10:29.761
Can I get
you fellas anything?

10:29.803 --> 10:31.847
I think it's time
for another round.

10:31.888 --> 10:33.974
Hey, bartender!

10:34.015 --> 10:36.935
Hey, see you around,
brother.

10:50.949 --> 10:53.409
Kix, Jesse.

11:07.590 --> 11:09.342
To the 212th!

11:09.384 --> 11:11.219
Down the hatch, boys!

11:11.260 --> 11:12.721
Ah!

11:19.519 --> 11:22.104
Fan out, and check IDs.

11:35.911 --> 11:40.248
So I guess the 501st
is back on Coruscant?

11:40.289 --> 11:43.752
Oh, yeah, we just got back
from Ringo Vinda.

11:43.793 --> 11:47.213
The strangest thing
happened out there.

11:47.255 --> 11:50.299
Yeah, I know.

11:51.467 --> 11:52.928
Fives?

11:52.969 --> 11:54.930
Whoa.
What's going on?

11:54.971 --> 11:57.306
They say you tried
to assassinate the Chancellor

11:57.348 --> 12:00.100
and that you're infected
with that virus that killed Tup.

12:00.142 --> 12:02.020
I don't have time
to explain right now.

12:02.062 --> 12:03.688
All I can tell you is...

12:03.730 --> 12:05.440
is that I'm being framed.

12:05.481 --> 12:09.611
All of us, even the Jedi,
are in grave danger.

12:09.652 --> 12:11.613
But what can I do, Fives?

12:11.654 --> 12:12.948
How can I help?

12:12.989 --> 12:14.114
I need to talk to Rex,

12:14.156 --> 12:16.785
or...
or General Skywalker.

12:16.826 --> 12:18.870
Well, they've been tasked
with finding you.

12:18.912 --> 12:20.288
Just... just turn yourself in!

12:20.329 --> 12:21.748
No!

12:21.790 --> 12:23.792
No, I'll never get to them.

12:23.833 --> 12:25.585
You don't understand.

12:25.627 --> 12:29.129
What I'm mixed up in,
it goes all the way to the top.

12:29.171 --> 12:32.132
The highest levels
are involved in the conspiracy.

12:32.174 --> 12:33.760
I have to talk
to General Skywalker

12:33.802 --> 12:36.554
and Rex directly,
alone.

12:36.596 --> 12:38.222
Look, I can contact Rex,

12:38.264 --> 12:40.809
but I can't guarantee
he'll bring the General.

12:40.850 --> 12:42.811
Good, good, good.

12:42.852 --> 12:43.853
Thanks, Kix.

12:43.895 --> 12:45.145
I appreciate it.

12:45.187 --> 12:47.273
Here.
Here are the coordinates.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.778
Just make sure
he meets me there.

12:51.820 --> 12:53.822
Right.

12:53.863 --> 12:55.323
Good luck, Fives.

12:55.364 --> 12:57.450
Identification,
please.

12:57.492 --> 12:59.786
Have you seen this clone?

12:59.828 --> 13:00.912
Uh, no, sir.

13:00.954 --> 13:01.997
I haven't seen him.

13:02.038 --> 13:03.957
All right.
Move along.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.299
Identification, please.

13:23.810 --> 13:26.146
All right,
you guys check out.

13:26.186 --> 13:27.480
Move along.

14:43.181 --> 14:44.849
Sir, the fugitive clone
has been spotted

14:44.891 --> 14:47.727
by one of our probes
in sector I-9.

15:08.790 --> 15:11.209
Well, these are
the coordinates Kix gave us.

15:11.251 --> 15:13.128
Let's hope Fives is inside.

15:13.169 --> 15:15.546
Eh, I hope he knows
what he's doing.

15:30.186 --> 15:31.562
Fives?

15:31.604 --> 15:34.732
Fives, we're here.

15:34.774 --> 15:35.900
Come on out.

15:35.942 --> 15:38.402
We just want to talk to you.

15:44.159 --> 15:47.036
General Skywalker, thank you.

15:47.078 --> 15:48.913
Thank you for trusting me.

15:48.955 --> 15:51.373
Now, have you come
without troops?

15:51.415 --> 15:53.918
We have.

15:53.960 --> 15:56.754
Put down your weapons, then.

15:56.796 --> 15:58.714
I don't think so, Fives.

15:58.756 --> 16:00.133
Please, sir!

16:00.175 --> 16:03.219
Please, I'm unarmed.

16:05.596 --> 16:07.056
All right.

16:07.098 --> 16:09.934
I'm putting my pistols down.

16:12.228 --> 16:15.564
What are we here for,
Fives?

16:15.606 --> 16:17.608
I need your help.

16:17.650 --> 16:19.068
I know you do.

16:19.110 --> 16:20.862
We know you're not well.

16:20.903 --> 16:22.947
It's been rough for you
these past couple days.

16:22.989 --> 16:24.866
I'm not crazy!

16:24.907 --> 16:29.954
Please, please, just...
just hear what I have to say.

16:32.498 --> 16:34.000
We're here to help you,
Fives.

16:34.042 --> 16:35.751
Just come with us.

16:35.793 --> 16:37.419
Let us take you back
to the Temple.

16:40.798 --> 16:43.592
No!

16:43.634 --> 16:45.970
I just need you
to listen to me.

16:46.012 --> 16:47.596
Please.

16:47.638 --> 16:50.099
I'm not really sure
we have any other choice.

16:50.141 --> 16:54.062
I was framed
because I know the truth...

16:54.103 --> 16:57.773
the truth about a plot,
a massive deception.

16:57.815 --> 16:59.692
By whom?

16:59.734 --> 17:03.279
Well, there's a sinister plot
in the works against the Jedi.

17:03.321 --> 17:04.864
I have proof of it.

17:04.906 --> 17:07.282
I can prove that everything
that I know is true

17:07.325 --> 17:09.617
beyond a shadow of a doubt!

17:09.660 --> 17:12.038
Show me the evidence.

17:12.079 --> 17:15.790
The evidence is in here.

17:15.833 --> 17:17.210
It's... it's in here.

17:17.252 --> 17:19.587
It's in all of us,
every clone.

17:19.627 --> 17:21.714
What is it?

17:21.756 --> 17:25.634
Organic chips built
into our genetic code

17:25.675 --> 17:28.804
to make us do
whatever someone wants,

17:28.846 --> 17:31.057
even kill the Jedi.

17:31.099 --> 17:33.142
It's all in here.

17:35.103 --> 17:37.605
Let's just get you
some help first.

17:37.646 --> 17:39.357
Then we can review everything.

17:39.399 --> 17:40.733
It'll be okay, Fives.

17:40.775 --> 17:42.651
We'll sort this out.

17:42.693 --> 17:45.154
Ah, you don't believe me!

17:48.324 --> 17:50.159
We're closing in on the target.

17:50.201 --> 17:52.828
Everyone be ready.

17:52.870 --> 17:55.831
Fives, we are listening to you.

17:55.873 --> 17:57.458
We only want to help.

17:57.499 --> 17:59.210
How do I know
you're not tricking me?

17:59.252 --> 18:01.963
How do I know
it won't be a trap?

18:02.004 --> 18:03.881
The Chancellor will try to kill me.

18:03.923 --> 18:05.591
I promise you that!

18:05.633 --> 18:07.302
The Chancellor?

18:11.055 --> 18:13.349
He's in on it!

18:13.391 --> 18:14.892
I don't know to what extent.

18:14.934 --> 18:17.645
But I know he orchestrated
much of this.

18:17.686 --> 18:19.521
He told me in the medical bay!

18:19.563 --> 18:21.023
He told you?

18:21.065 --> 18:22.858
When you tried to assassinate him?

18:22.900 --> 18:25.194
You have gone too far,
Fives.

18:25.236 --> 18:27.322
The Chancellor isn't capable
of what you claim.

18:27.363 --> 18:28.781
He is!

18:28.823 --> 18:30.325
I swear to you, General.

18:30.366 --> 18:31.367
You have no idea...

18:31.409 --> 18:32.576
Stand down, soldier!

18:32.618 --> 18:33.828
Stand down!
Get on your knees!

18:33.869 --> 18:35.871
No! No! No!
Stay back!

18:35.913 --> 18:37.539
Don't do it!
Don't do it, soldier!

18:37.581 --> 18:38.874
Get away from me!

18:38.916 --> 18:40.709
Fives, no!

18:51.262 --> 18:52.972
Fives!

18:53.014 --> 18:54.223
Fives!

18:54.265 --> 18:55.224
Fives...

18:55.266 --> 18:57.018
Get this ray shield off!

18:59.061 --> 19:00.729
Fives.

19:00.771 --> 19:02.273
Brother...

19:02.315 --> 19:03.274
Call for help!

19:03.316 --> 19:04.608
We need a medic!

19:04.650 --> 19:07.278
Rex...

19:07.320 --> 19:09.155
Fives...

19:09.197 --> 19:10.698
This...

19:10.739 --> 19:14.285
it's bigger
than any of us...

19:14.327 --> 19:19.165
than anything
I could have imagined.

19:19.207 --> 19:22.751
I-I never meant to...

19:22.793 --> 19:25.671
I only wanted to do my duty.

19:28.799 --> 19:30.051
Brother...

19:30.092 --> 19:32.261
Fives.
Stay with me, Fives!

19:32.303 --> 19:33.388
Fives!

19:33.429 --> 19:36.098
The mission...

19:36.140 --> 19:37.808
the nightmares...

19:37.850 --> 19:40.102
they're...

19:40.144 --> 19:43.523
finally over.

19:45.983 --> 19:47.235
Fives?

19:47.276 --> 19:48.652
No, Fives.

19:48.694 --> 19:50.279
Come on, Fives, don't go!

19:50.321 --> 19:51.655
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

19:51.697 --> 19:53.991
Fives! Fives!

19:54.033 --> 19:57.078
Don't go.

19:57.119 --> 19:59.414
No.

19:59.455 --> 20:01.582
Oh, no.

20:14.887 --> 20:18.182
A tragic situation, indeed.

20:18.224 --> 20:20.017
About the clones' breakdowns,

20:20.059 --> 20:22.186
have we discovered
any new evidence?

20:22.228 --> 20:26.315
I've had my own personal doctors
examine both bodies.

20:26.357 --> 20:31.653
It appears Nala Se did miss
something in her examination.

20:31.695 --> 20:34.532
Another cause your doctors found?

20:36.658 --> 20:38.578
A parasite.

20:38.619 --> 20:41.330
Native to Ringo Vinda.

20:41.372 --> 20:44.833
Probably in the canteen of water
they both shared.

20:44.875 --> 20:47.836
It did cause the inhibitors to decay,

20:47.878 --> 20:50.256
once the parasite had taken hold.

20:50.298 --> 20:52.674
It is very rare.

20:52.716 --> 20:55.010
However, just to be cautious,

20:55.052 --> 20:57.263
we have prepared an inoculation

20:57.305 --> 21:01.142
for every clone trooper in our army.

21:01.183 --> 21:04.019
So I guess it's over, then?

21:04.061 --> 21:05.854
Yes.

21:05.896 --> 21:10.276
We can finally put this whole
wretched situation behind us.

21:10.318 --> 21:14.280
We must direct our attention
back to the war at hand.

21:14.322 --> 21:19.118
Each day we grow closer 
and closer...

21:19.160 --> 21:21.287
to victory.

21:28.169 --> 21:30.129
<i>Lord Tyranus,</i>

21:30.171 --> 21:33.508
<i>have you received the inhibitor
chip that you requested?</i>

21:33.549 --> 21:38.262
I have, indeed.
You have done well, doctor.

21:48.189 --> 21:51.567
Our plan has gone undiscovered,
master.

21:51.609 --> 21:54.111
The clone in question is now dead,

21:54.153 --> 21:57.948
and the Jedi still suspect nothing.

21:57.990 --> 22:02.744
<i>Good.
Destroy all evidence.</i>

22:02.786 --> 22:04.746
<i>When the time comes,</i>

22:04.788 --> 22:07.916
<i>no one will be able
to stop our plan</i>

22:07.958 --> 22:12.921
<i>to execute Order 66.</i>
