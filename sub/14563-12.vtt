00:05.005 --> 00:08.509
<i>Sarah Lynn! Sarah Lynn!</i>

00:08.592 --> 00:10.636
<i>Okay, one more song.</i>

00:10.719 --> 00:12.304
<i>I'm gonna slow things down.</i>

00:12.387 --> 00:17.768
<i>- This is "My Heinie Ain't So Tiny."</i>

00:24.233 --> 00:26.276
Sarah Lynn is very tired.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.446
Can you just tell her BoJack's here?
Horseman. I'm an old friend.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.782
Well, I'll tell her, but...

00:33.700 --> 00:37.079
BoJack? Oh, my God! Bring him in!

00:37.162 --> 00:40.207
-I can't believe you came to my concert.
-It was incredible.

00:40.290 --> 00:43.085
When you sang that one ballad
and shot fireworks out of your boobs,

00:43.168 --> 00:45.671
that was such a moving tribute
to gays in the military.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.130
We are going out.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.466
Before you go, I need you
to sign these posters.

00:49.549 --> 00:52.052
It's for charity.
Doctors Without Posters.

00:52.135 --> 00:54.054
Okay. BoJack, can you
hang out for a minute?

00:54.137 --> 00:56.932
-Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.
-Also, we have those radio records,

00:57.015 --> 00:59.059
and you're doing the print ads
for Sarah Lynn's Stank,

00:59.142 --> 01:00.561
the new fragrance from Kevin Kline.

01:00.644 --> 01:02.938
-You mean Calvin Klein.
-Kevin Kline, BoJack.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.732
He's the only man who truly
understands my fragrance.

01:05.816 --> 01:08.485
I'll come back in 20 for those posters.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.613
Oh, my God. Being famous is the worst.

01:11.697 --> 01:15.367
-Ugh! Yeah, you're telling me.
-No, but, like, really famous.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.786
-Uh...
-How can I explain it to someone like you?

01:17.869 --> 01:21.957
I feel like all my friends only like me
because I'm Sarah Lynn, you know.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.668
-Nobody cares about Sarah Lipschitz.
-Who's Sarah Lipschitz?

01:24.751 --> 01:27.587
The lawyer who helped me change
my name from Sarah Helmulfarb.

01:27.671 --> 01:28.505
Oof!

01:28.588 --> 01:32.259
It is so great to see a real friend
who knew me before I got huge

01:32.342 --> 01:34.177
and isn't just trying
to get something out of me.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.095
Right.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.180
I swear you are, like,
the only one I have left.

01:37.264 --> 01:40.684
I am this close to falling off
the deep end.

01:40.767 --> 01:44.479
I know I'm smiling right now,
but the light inside me is dying.

01:44.563 --> 01:45.397
Uh, what?

01:45.480 --> 01:48.609
But here I am blah-blah-blah-ing
about my own boring, sexy, thrilling life.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.485
What is going on with you?

01:50.569 --> 01:54.197
Well, actually, I'm doing this new show,
<i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>

01:54.281 --> 01:57.117
-I don't know if you've seen it or--
-Ugh, I'm so busy with the tour.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.870
Yeah, no, of course, no,
but it's been a lot of fun.

01:59.953 --> 02:03.415
The ratings aren't great,
but we have this upcoming episode,

02:03.498 --> 02:06.960
and we're looking
for a really big guest star.

02:07.044 --> 02:10.088
Oh. You want me to be on your show?

02:10.172 --> 02:15.552
Well, I just thought it would
be really fun for... the both of us.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.138
You know, like the old days.

02:19.765 --> 02:22.267
I have the script with me
if you want to take a look at it.

02:22.351 --> 02:25.228
Um, okay. Why don't you put it
on that pile over there?

02:25.312 --> 02:27.564
And I'll get to it
when I have some free time.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.066
-Over here?
-Yeah.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.818
I'd love to keep hanging out,
but these doctors need their posters,

02:31.902 --> 02:33.403
and I'm already pretty exhausted.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.529
You should probably go.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.324
-Oh, okay.
-It's all very exhausting.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.617
Thanks again for coming.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.079
Like I said, it's always nice
to see a... you.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.580
Yeah.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.708
<i>Adam Levine has tweeted his sympathies.</i>

02:46.792 --> 02:50.212
<i>"Today we lost an icon.</i>
<i>#SheWillBeLoved</i>

02:50.295 --> 02:52.839
<i>#WatchTheVoiceSeason10."</i>

02:52.923 --> 02:55.008
<i>Again, for those just joining us,</i>

02:55.092 --> 02:59.596
<i>actress and pop star Sarah Lynn</i>
<i>is dead at 31.</i>

03:58.071 --> 04:02.534
Day 75 at sea: there's a darkness
brewing on the horizon.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.912
I feel it. What say you, skippy?

04:06.663 --> 04:10.417
<i>I think you got a touch</i>
<i>of the ocean madness, Margo.</i>

04:10.500 --> 04:13.253
And I think you got a real smart mouth.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.255
You want another night in the box?

04:15.338 --> 04:16.673
<i>No, anything but that!</i>

04:16.757 --> 04:20.844
Then quit your yappin'
and fix Mama a Sazerac.

04:23.388 --> 04:26.391
Hey, is that character actress
Margo Martindale?

04:26.475 --> 04:28.852
She's on the FBI's Most Wanted list

04:28.935 --> 04:32.731
and the AV Club's list of 20 actresses
that always make everything better.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.150
-We gotta call this in, right?
-That depends.

04:35.233 --> 04:38.695
Are we professional blimp pilots,
or are we casting directors?

04:38.779 --> 04:40.113
Blimp pilots, sir.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.825
Then we're not being paid to discover
underutilized character actresses.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.952
We're being paid to pilot this blimp.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.622
<i>Hey, Margo, do you see something</i>
<i>out there across the water?</i>

04:48.705 --> 04:51.917
Yeah. What is that?

04:58.924 --> 05:00.967
All clear from here to Los Angeles.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.552
We've hit a few delays,

05:02.636 --> 05:05.180
but you'll get your precious cargo
by tomorrow.

05:05.263 --> 05:06.097
Tomorrow?

05:06.181 --> 05:08.558
But the big opening
of my restaurant is tonight!

05:08.642 --> 05:12.521
How can I offer the real Italian cuisine
without my real Italian spaghett'?

05:12.604 --> 05:14.898
Spaghett' is how Italian people
say "spaghetti."

05:14.981 --> 05:16.983
We'll get you your pasta.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.444
Better do what he says.
He might have friends in the Mob.

05:19.528 --> 05:22.948
"Friends in the Mob"?
That is an ugly stereotype.

05:24.157 --> 05:28.203
You heard the man.
Set this boat's controls to "faster."

05:28.286 --> 05:29.287
Aye-aye, Cap'n.

05:32.290 --> 05:36.086
Oh, I see how it is.
Wanna play a game of chicken, huh?

05:36.169 --> 05:39.339
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>this is a good idea, Margo.</i>

05:39.422 --> 05:42.467
Cram it, skip! Those limp dicks
are about to find out

05:42.551 --> 05:45.345
what savvy film and television viewers
have known for years.

05:45.428 --> 05:50.642
Character actress Margo Martindale
ain't afraid of nothin'!

05:50.725 --> 05:53.937
The boats are about to collide!
We have to do something!

05:54.020 --> 05:55.981
You know damn well,
when we took to the sky,

05:56.064 --> 05:59.317
we made a solemn oath never to meddle
in the affairs of land nor sea.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.111
We are sworn but to observe.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.696
This is the blimper's promise.

06:02.779 --> 06:06.116
Oh, no! The boats
are tearing each other apart!

06:06.199 --> 06:09.452
Crates and crates of spaghetti
are pouring out into the ocean!

06:09.536 --> 06:12.539
I'm watching the same boat collision
you are. You don't need to narrate it.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.583
Oh!

06:14.666 --> 06:19.713
No! Skippy!
He was too pure for this world!

06:21.798 --> 06:23.133
Oh, no!

06:23.216 --> 06:25.760
The pasta is cooking!

06:26.428 --> 06:29.848
If only we had some olive oil
to reduce the stickiness.

06:29.931 --> 06:33.852
But olive oil doesn't actually
reduce the stickiness in pasta.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.687
That's only a myth.

06:35.770 --> 06:39.733
No! I've wasted so much of my life

06:39.816 --> 06:43.695
stirring olive oil into pasta!

06:44.988 --> 06:48.158
Disaster <i>al dente</i>
off the coast of San Clemente!

06:48.241 --> 06:50.827
Twelve tons of pasta
have leaked into the ocean,

06:50.910 --> 06:55.081
and the massive carbo load
is heading straight to Pacific Ocean City.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.252
Joining us via Google Hangout

06:59.336 --> 07:01.630
is spaghetti scientist Carla Hall.

07:01.713 --> 07:04.883
-What can you tell us, Carla?
-Well, Tom, as the spaghetti cooks,

07:04.966 --> 07:07.093
it will expand, smothering the town

07:07.177 --> 07:09.971
and tenderly broiling the sea life
who reside there.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.514
Is there any way to prevent

07:11.598 --> 07:14.684
this delicious-sounding
environmental catastrophe?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.186
The only hope for rescue would be

07:16.269 --> 07:19.105
if someone had an enormous quantity
of spaghetti strainers

07:19.189 --> 07:20.523
just sitting around the house,

07:20.607 --> 07:23.902
but that person would also need
access to a fleet of drivers

07:23.985 --> 07:25.904
to transport said spaghetti strainers,

07:25.987 --> 07:28.239
and in order to strain
the spaghetti fast enough,

07:28.323 --> 07:31.076
the drivers would also need to be
incredibly strong swimmers,

07:31.159 --> 07:33.954
like, just as an example,
hot, sexy killer whales.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.623
Is there such a savior
who could possibly fit

07:36.706 --> 07:39.668
that ridiculously specific
set of criteria?

07:39.751 --> 07:44.255
I don't know, Tom, but as they used to say
on my favorite TV show, let's find out.

07:46.883 --> 07:50.512
A movie, during the day? Dare I?

07:50.595 --> 07:52.722
One for <i>Secretariat,</i> please!

07:53.682 --> 07:54.724
Thank you.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.601
And, now, to turn my phone off.

07:56.685 --> 08:00.772
If anyone needs me in the next two hours,
they'll just have to wait.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.817
<i>This tragedy truly puts</i>
<i>the "no" into noodle,</i>

08:03.900 --> 08:08.697
<i>the "ruh-roh" in rotelli,</i>
<i>and the "oh, man" in manicotti.</i>

08:08.780 --> 08:10.865
<i>Damn it, Randy.</i>
<i>Just pick your best one.</i>

08:10.949 --> 08:12.909
-What's going on?
-You didn't hear?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.577
They need spaghetti strainers stat,

08:14.661 --> 08:17.789
or it's "pasta la vista"
for Pacific Ocean City.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.791
Oh, no!

08:20.875 --> 08:24.546
Come on, come on, come on!
Pick up, Mr. Peanutbutter!

08:24.629 --> 08:26.715
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Oh! Mr. Peanutbutter, we need--

08:26.798 --> 08:28.508
<i>You've reached the voicemail</i>
<i>of Mr. Peanutbutter.</i>

08:28.591 --> 08:29.843
No!

08:29.926 --> 08:34.097
<i>I'm not just running for me.</i>
<i>I'm running for America.</i>

08:34.180 --> 08:36.558
Oh-ho-ho!

08:36.641 --> 08:39.561
Cabracadabblers,
to Mr. Peanutbutter's house!

08:39.644 --> 08:43.857
<i>Mr. Peanutbutter's House </i>the show,
or Mr. Peanutbutter's house the house?

08:43.940 --> 08:46.234
The house. Obviously, the house.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.573
Wow, that was a good movie.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.492
Was it Oscar-worthy? Who's to say?

08:54.576 --> 08:57.328
Ninety-eight messages?
Better listen to them all, in order.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.831
<i>Mr. Peanutbutter, call me back</i>
<i>as soon as you get this, okay?</i>

08:59.914 --> 09:01.708
<i>We need your strainers.</i>
<i>This is life and death.</i>

09:01.791 --> 09:03.877
- Oh, my God!
<i>-  Mr. Peanutbutter,</i>

09:03.960 --> 09:08.214
<i>I'm at your house with the entire</i>
<i>Cabracadabra fleet, but we can't get in!</i>

09:08.298 --> 09:09.591
<i>You need to get over here!</i>

09:09.674 --> 09:12.302
<i>It's a spaghetti-strainer-related</i>
<i>emergency.</i>

09:12.385 --> 09:15.555
All right, buddy, just as soon as I listen
to these other 96 messages.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.891
<i>Good afternoon, I'm calling</i>
<i>from Center Theater Group.</i>

09:17.974 --> 09:19.726

09:19.809 --> 09:22.187
<i>I wonder if I could interest you</i>
<i>in a full season subscription--</i>

09:22.270 --> 09:23.980
Oh, I don't have time for this!

09:25.190 --> 09:27.025
If we don't get some kind of miracle--

09:27.108 --> 09:29.110
Wait! In the distance! Is that--?

09:29.194 --> 09:31.029
No, it can't be!

09:33.573 --> 09:36.951
Spaghetti or not, here I come.

09:41.706 --> 09:42.707
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

09:42.791 --> 09:45.960
Sabrina, I'm coming down
for my birthday surprise!

09:46.044 --> 09:47.378
Oh, no!

09:48.046 --> 09:50.924
Well, I've heard of
pasta point of no return,

09:51.007 --> 09:53.051
<i>but this is ridiculous!</i>

09:55.553 --> 09:58.598
<i>Why didn't you just tell me</i>
<i>you made too much spaghetti?</i>

09:58.681 --> 10:03.228
I thought if you knew I made a big mess
that you wouldn't love me anymore.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.563
- Aw!
- Sabrina, that's not going to happen.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.690
We're a family now, no matter what,

10:07.774 --> 10:10.026
and I will always be there for you.

10:10.110 --> 10:10.944
Okay.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.948
Now, get in that kitchen
and eat all that spaghetti.

10:15.031 --> 10:18.785
I gotta eat all that?
That's too much, man!

10:21.538 --> 10:23.623
I never understood why
the <i>Horsin' Around</i> house

10:23.706 --> 10:25.333
-had two sets of stairs.
-What?

10:25.416 --> 10:28.169
One in the living room
and one in the kitchen. Why?

10:28.253 --> 10:30.046
Have you ever been in a house like that?

10:30.130 --> 10:32.715
-What are you doing here?
-You didn't answer your phone.

10:32.799 --> 10:33.800
I was worried about you.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.305
The funeral was huge.
There were so many people there.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.850
I kept thinking, "I did this to her,"

10:41.933 --> 10:45.186
and everyone was just standing around
like, "Well, this was bound to happen,"

10:45.270 --> 10:47.772
but... it wasn't bound to happen.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.941
I'm really sorry, BoJack.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.317
I don't know how to be, Diane.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.653
It doesn't get better
and it doesn't get easier.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.781
I can't keep lying to myself,
saying "I'm gonna change." I'm poison.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.616
-BoJack--
-I come from poison.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.786
I have poison inside me,
and I destroy everything I touch.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.163
That's my legacy.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.290
I have nothing to show
for the life that I've lived,

11:05.373 --> 11:07.917
and I have nobody in my life
who's better off for having known me.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.336
-That isn't true.
-Isn't it, though?

11:12.172 --> 11:15.758
When I was a kid,
I used to watch you on TV.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.261
And you know I didn't have
the best family.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.138
Things weren't that great for me.

11:20.221 --> 11:23.766
But, for half an hour every week,
I got to watch this show

11:23.850 --> 11:26.603
about four people who had nobody,

11:26.686 --> 11:29.772
who came together and became a family.

11:29.856 --> 11:33.735
And, for half an hour every week,
I had a home,

11:33.818 --> 11:35.862
and it helped me survive.

11:35.945 --> 11:41.200
BoJack, there are millions of people
who are better off for having known you.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.536
Why did you never tell me that?

11:43.620 --> 11:47.415
I guess to preserve some fiction
of journalistic objectivity.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.918
-Like that's a thing.
-I know you don't want to hear this,

11:50.001 --> 11:52.879
but you're too good to be writing
Instagram captions for celebrities.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.714
-I'm not just--
-I'm sorry, but you are.

11:54.797 --> 11:57.133
-You know you are.
-Okay. Thank you.

11:57.216 --> 12:00.803
And I wish you didn't get so distant
after you moved out.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.973
-I'm sorry.
-You know me better than anybody,

12:04.057 --> 12:06.392
and you can't not be a part of my life.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.357
Tools! This is Brad.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.776
-I want to do <i>Ethan Around.</i>
-Oh, very funny.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.486
Is this Jeff from Hammers and More?

12:16.569 --> 12:18.947
-No, it's me, BoJack Horseman.
-Wait, really?

12:19.030 --> 12:22.492
Yeah. I think now more than ever
people need shows like <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

12:22.575 --> 12:25.620
I... need a show like <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

12:25.703 --> 12:28.665
Okay, but this isn't
like last time, is it?

12:28.748 --> 12:30.333
Where you say you want to do it,

12:30.416 --> 12:32.502
but then, I find out
you don't actually want to do it,

12:32.585 --> 12:34.420
and then, your mean publicist yells at me?

12:34.504 --> 12:36.923
And, at the airport, on the way home,
I get one of those big pretzels,

12:37.006 --> 12:38.591
but then, I drop the pretzel
on the ground,

12:38.675 --> 12:40.551
and it gets eaten by a ant?

12:40.635 --> 12:41.719
What? No.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.429
You won't regret this, BoJack.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.183
Attention, customers!
Please leave and never come back.

12:47.266 --> 12:50.395
Tools! is closed forever.
I'm going Hollywoo!

12:53.189 --> 12:55.566
Please, please! I'm no hero.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.944
I'm just a guy
with some bowls full of holes.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.404
Thanks again.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.198
It's funny. You help out
at one disaster area,

13:02.281 --> 13:04.909
and, suddenly, everybody loves you,
unless you're Sean Penn.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.786
Great PR for Cabracadabra, too.

13:06.869 --> 13:10.081
Yeah, you can't buy that kind of press,
and you can buy most kinds of press.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.500
I hope some of that press
makes its way to this reader

13:12.583 --> 13:15.294
because she is not a fan
of Cabracadabra.

13:15.378 --> 13:19.424
-She hates it.
-I don't hate Cabracadabra.

13:19.507 --> 13:20.842
I just think it objectifies women

13:20.925 --> 13:24.262
and contributes to a cheap and damaging
culture of sexist commodification

13:24.345 --> 13:27.015
that undercuts the exact reason
it was started in the first place.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.725
But, you know, everything does that.

13:28.808 --> 13:33.062
<i>Cosmo </i>does that.
Kids' movies, athletic gear... statues.

13:33.146 --> 13:37.191
Yes, but this objectification of women
ended up saving lots of lives,

13:37.275 --> 13:41.696
many of whom were also women,
so, therefore, not sexist?

13:41.779 --> 13:43.656
I can't argue with that.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.783
Well, the good news is,
you don't have to anymore,

13:45.867 --> 13:47.452
because I'm selling the company!

13:47.535 --> 13:48.369
Oh!

13:48.453 --> 13:50.621
You know, it's really too bad
you shut down the agency,

13:50.705 --> 13:52.957
because, if you could've held out
for just a couple more months,

13:53.041 --> 13:55.084
right now,
Vim would be rolling in money.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.128
I'm really happy for you,

13:57.211 --> 13:59.464
but I'm actually enjoying my time off.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.132
Ralph and I went on vacation.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.176
Can you believe this one
had never been to Cairo?

14:03.259 --> 14:05.720
Those Egyptians really know
how to treat a cat.

14:05.803 --> 14:09.182
And what do you do, Ralph,
that you can just hop on a plane to Cairo?

14:09.265 --> 14:11.768
Well, I own and operate
my own greeting card company,

14:11.851 --> 14:13.686
but everywhere I go, I have a free room.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.773
-Oh, because you're a mouse?
-What? No.

14:16.856 --> 14:20.234
-Because I'm a Stilton.
-Oh, my God! Like Stilton hotels?

14:20.318 --> 14:22.487
I gotta take this. It's my new agent.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.113
-Hello?
-So, anyway--

14:24.197 --> 14:26.240
Another offer? That's incredible!

14:26.324 --> 14:28.326
-Ralph and I--
-They want to pay me how much?

14:28.409 --> 14:30.453
That is a lot of zeroes. Sign me up.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.622
What is he doing?
You never take the first offer.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.832
Hey, Diane, what have you been up to?

14:34.916 --> 14:36.876
Well, I'm just weighing my options.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.670
-I don't want to just jump into my next--
-You know what you should do?

14:39.754 --> 14:42.215
Ralph's sister Stefani
is starting a new website.

14:42.298 --> 14:47.470
It's a feminism/lifestyle/celebrity blog/
newsletter/community hub,

14:47.553 --> 14:52.183
and she's looking for a partner/editor/
"bomb-ass super bitch," her words.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.352
You'd be perfect for it.
I'll set a meeting.

14:54.435 --> 14:57.105
Yeah, that could be cool.
Why don't you give her my info?

14:57.188 --> 15:01.317
No, no. I'll just set a meeting.
It's easy. I'm not doing anything else.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.653
-Except enjoying your time off, right?
-Right.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.947
Wow, another amazing offer!

15:06.030 --> 15:08.074
It's like everywhere I look,
money, money, money!

15:08.157 --> 15:10.660
Even ten percent of this
would be quite a windfall.

15:15.665 --> 15:16.958
-I like your friends.
-Yeah.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.042
And I like this.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.085
Mwah!

15:19.168 --> 15:21.003
-This is working.
-I like it, too.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.423
That was smart of you
to think of Diane for GirlCrush.

15:23.506 --> 15:24.799
You're always making great connections.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.384
That's probably why you were
such a good manager.

15:26.467 --> 15:29.679
-I wasn't a manager. I was an agent.
-Oh, right. Sorry.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.597
Well, whatever it was,
I'm glad that it's over,

15:31.681 --> 15:33.516
because I don't want
to share you with anybody.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.685
Oh, my God!
Maybe that was the problem!

15:35.768 --> 15:38.896
-Maybe what was the problem?
-All this time, I thought I was an agent,

15:38.980 --> 15:41.983
but what if what I was really
supposed to be was a manager?

15:42.066 --> 15:44.861
-What's the difference?
-It's a completely different line of work.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.779
An agent helps a client find jobs,

15:46.863 --> 15:49.574
but a manager helps manage
a client's career.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.118
-It sounds exactly the same.
-I think I'm having an epiphany.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.370
It's like I've been wearing
the wrong bra size this whole time.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.914
Okay, if this is the thing
that'll make you happy,

15:56.998 --> 15:58.666
then I totally support you,

15:58.749 --> 16:02.879
but it kind of sounds like you're just
going back to the same sort of job

16:02.962 --> 16:04.630
that made you miserable
for the last 20 years.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.924
No, Ralph. Don't you get it?
This is a new beginning.

16:07.008 --> 16:10.011
-I'm gonna be a manager!
-Oh...

16:12.305 --> 16:14.432
-Wow.
-Takes you back, doesn't it?

16:14.515 --> 16:16.559
Listen, before everyone
gets here tomorrow,

16:16.642 --> 16:17.768
I have a couple notes on the script.

16:17.852 --> 16:20.438
Too many "yowza-yowza bo-bowzas,"
or not enough?

16:20.521 --> 16:22.106
No. On page 18,

16:22.190 --> 16:24.901
Ethan and the Horse try to get Julia
to put on the roller skates,

16:24.984 --> 16:26.068
and she runs out of the room crying,

16:26.152 --> 16:27.904
and then, the Horse says,
"That went well."

16:28.488 --> 16:32.325
-Anything about that feel weird to you?
-No, see, the Horse is being sarcastic.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.495
It didn't go well. So, when the Horse
says, "That went well," it's funny.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.747
-Dramatic irony.
-No, I get the irony.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.583
That's not the issue.
This is a guaranteed laugh.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.544
-You're giving me the cut to commercial.
-And that's a problem for you?

16:43.628 --> 16:47.673
This is <i>Ethan Around. </i>It's your show,
and we need to tell the audience that.

16:47.757 --> 16:50.843
-You can't give all the best jokes to me.
-I don't know, BoJack.

16:50.927 --> 16:53.346
You really think I'm ready
for a "That went well"?

16:53.429 --> 16:55.556
-You tell me. Let's hear it.
-That went well!

16:55.640 --> 16:58.059
You're pushing too hard.
The line's funny. Trust the line.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.353
-That went well.
-Great. Now let me hear you throw it away.

17:00.436 --> 17:03.856
-Oh, like a-- That went well.
-Yes, that was great!

17:03.940 --> 17:05.691
And that was a great look,
with the eyebrow.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.485
-What if we both did that?
-Yeah, yeah.

17:07.568 --> 17:08.611
I'm looking at you like,

17:08.694 --> 17:11.113
"This parenting thing is gonna
be harder than I thought,"

17:11.197 --> 17:14.242
and you're looking at me like,
"Now you see what I had to go through."

17:14.325 --> 17:16.369
-Exactly. Let's try it.
-Well, that went well.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.286
Hmm...

17:17.370 --> 17:20.039
-Oh, my God. Chills.
-Yeah, you feel that?

17:20.122 --> 17:22.208
-Yeah.
-Now that's how you cut to commercial.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.751
That actually went well.

17:28.172 --> 17:31.425
This place has really gone downhill
since they got that new chef.

17:31.509 --> 17:34.262
As I was saying, I don't think the site
needs to be just one thing.

17:34.345 --> 17:37.848
I think it can be a big umbrella,
but, like, also not an umbrella.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.016
That's GirlCroosh.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.851
Sorry, did you say "croosh"?

17:40.935 --> 17:43.563
Oh, you do not need
to apologize here, Diane.

17:43.646 --> 17:46.983
"Sorry" is a crutch
and "crutch" is an ableist term.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.318
I'm sorry if that shocks you,
but I will not apologize for it.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.821
So, can I ask what
the business model is here?

17:51.904 --> 17:55.283
Diane, I'm rich.
I'm not doing this to make money.

17:55.366 --> 17:57.994
I'm doing this to make connections
with real women

17:58.077 --> 18:00.204
and extend my personal brand
as a real down-to-earth <i>chica</i>

18:00.288 --> 18:01.289
who cares about real women.

18:01.372 --> 18:02.915
Well, you know what's great about that is,

18:02.999 --> 18:04.959
if you're not beholden to ad revenue,
your writers can--

18:05.042 --> 18:08.838
Yes! That is exactly the idea,
whatever you were about to say.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.340
I want to give you a real support system,

18:11.424 --> 18:15.928
because, honestly, Diane,
what you do is so croosh.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.389
That shit you said about
Hank Hippopopalous last year

18:18.472 --> 18:20.850
was supernova red hot badass.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.936
It wasn't even on fleek.
Fleek was on it.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.772
-Thank you.
-One thing though. Is anything off limits?

18:26.856 --> 18:30.693
Like, if you had to write a piece
about your husband, could you do it?

18:30.776 --> 18:32.778
-Why would I have to do that?
-I don't know.

18:32.862 --> 18:35.239
Because his company
is basically Hooters on wheels?

18:35.323 --> 18:38.367
-He's actually selling that company.
-Well, he's still a public figure.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.494
What if Mr. Peanutbutter
does something problematic

18:40.578 --> 18:41.662
and you have a real hot take?

18:41.746 --> 18:44.749
If I have a problem with my husband,
I'm gonna talk to him about it directly.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.585
Okay, so what if you did that
and he didn't listen,

18:47.668 --> 18:50.046
and you knew that,
as much as you love him

18:50.129 --> 18:54.717
and as much as he loves you,
he's never gonna get it?

18:54.800 --> 18:57.845
And meanwhile, you also knew
that all your readers looked up to you

18:57.928 --> 19:00.431
and wanted to read your opinion?

19:00.514 --> 19:02.016
Would you write about it then?

19:03.768 --> 19:05.811
-You got the job?
-I got the job!

19:05.895 --> 19:07.521
Oh, my God! Can you believe it?

19:07.605 --> 19:10.107
In the same week,
I sell a company for millions of dollars

19:10.191 --> 19:12.401
and you get a job writing for a blog.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.612
When it rains, it pours, huh?

19:17.823 --> 19:21.702
And over here is where you can keep
all of your receipts,

19:21.786 --> 19:24.288
in your leaning tower of receipts.

19:24.372 --> 19:27.249
I think my client can handle it from here.

19:27.333 --> 19:31.379
This meeting is just to give you
and the other former partners your money.

19:31.462 --> 19:34.006
-Sign here.
-Okay.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.884
And here's your check.
That's all this needed to be.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.135
Whoa!

19:38.219 --> 19:40.221
This is for eight million dollars.

19:40.304 --> 19:43.224
Well, you are a one-third owner.
What did you expect?

19:43.307 --> 19:47.895
Todd, as a millionaire?
That'll lead to some interesting stories.

19:47.978 --> 19:51.357
What an exciting development.
How's that gonna change the dynamic?

19:51.440 --> 19:54.652
-I guess we're gonna find out, right?
-You can leave now.

19:54.735 --> 19:57.697
Hooray! Todd's in the one percent.

19:58.489 --> 19:59.865
Oh, uh...

19:59.949 --> 20:01.784
-Hey.
-Hi.

20:04.704 --> 20:10.042
Julia, this ice cream is only for girls
who try on their roller skates.

20:10.126 --> 20:14.755
-So, what do you say?
-Uh, I'm gonna swipe left on that idea.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.550
Cut! We got a lighting issue.

20:17.633 --> 20:20.928
What? I'll be in my trailer.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.347
-Hey, Chloe, that was really funny.
-Thanks.

20:23.431 --> 20:24.515
-Are you having fun?
-Mm-hmm.

20:24.598 --> 20:29.395
-You got any friends in the audience?
-No friends, but my mommy and my daddy.

20:29.478 --> 20:32.189
Oh. You want to know a secret
about your mommy and daddy?

20:32.273 --> 20:34.942
-What?
-They are really proud of you.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.902
Oh, I know that.

20:36.986 --> 20:39.029
What do you want to be
when you grow up, Chloe?

20:39.113 --> 20:42.241
What do you mean?
I want to be like you.

20:42.324 --> 20:45.035
-Like me?
-I want to be famous.

20:45.119 --> 20:46.662
Oh, no.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.790
- BoJack?
- Oh, God.

20:49.874 --> 20:52.084
-Is everything okay?
-I can't be here.

20:52.626 --> 20:53.919
I can't do this again. This isn't right.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.254
-What do you mean?
-I need to go.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.006
We need to shoot the rest of this episode.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.633
I'm sorry. I just-- I don't belong here.

20:59.717 --> 21:00.760
Where are you going?

21:02.595 --> 21:03.846
I don't know.

21:28.954 --> 21:32.541
So, what are you gonna do
with your eight million dollars?

21:32.625 --> 21:36.712
First, I'm gonna get a really fancy hat,
like, really fancy.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.381
Then, I'm gonna get a T-shirt
that says, "Hey, look at my hat."

21:39.465 --> 21:41.217
What about you?

21:41.300 --> 21:43.803
I've always wanted to go
to a super nice restaurant

21:43.886 --> 21:45.679
and order everything on the menu.

21:45.763 --> 21:48.599
Oh, yeah! That's, like,
first day millionaire stuff.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.185
We should go sometime, together.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.313
-Todd, can I ask you something?
-Of course.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.482
What's your deal?

21:56.565 --> 21:59.068
I feel like you like me,
but you don't like me,

21:59.151 --> 22:00.820
but you like me,
and I don't know what that is.

22:00.903 --> 22:01.987
Are you gay?

22:02.071 --> 22:05.533
-Whoa. Why would you even--?
-You can tell me if you're gay. It's fine.

22:05.616 --> 22:08.828
This isn't the 1600s,
or some places in the present.

22:08.911 --> 22:12.456
I'm not gay.
I mean, I don't think I am,

22:12.540 --> 22:15.501
but... I don't think I'm straight, either.

22:16.210 --> 22:18.087
I don't know what I am.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.297
I think I might be nothing.

22:20.381 --> 22:23.050
-Oh. Well, that's okay.
-Yeah?

22:23.133 --> 22:24.760
Yeah, of course.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.222
Thank you so much.

22:30.057 --> 22:33.686
Oh, crap! I accidentally tipped
the waitress eight million dollars!

22:33.769 --> 22:35.854
Well, guess I'm broke again.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.493
Who could that be?

22:49.577 --> 22:50.411
Pizza?

22:51.579 --> 22:53.247
Katrina, you're not pizza.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.040
Ugh. This fight again?

22:55.124 --> 22:58.586
Listen, butt-sniffer, I work for a guy
and we're looking for a guy.

22:58.669 --> 23:00.671
You're supposed to be this big hero now,

23:00.754 --> 23:02.715
so someone brought your name up
in a meeting,

23:02.798 --> 23:04.466
and, now, I have an opportunity for you.

23:04.550 --> 23:08.220
Oh, is it being married to you again?
Because I'd rather get euthanized.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.888
Spoiler alert from <i>Marley & Me.</i>

23:09.972 --> 23:12.182
That wasn't a spoiler until you said
the name of the movie.

23:12.266 --> 23:14.852
If you've got a gig for me,
you can go through my new manager.

23:14.935 --> 23:17.396
Oh, I'm not talking about a gig.

23:17.479 --> 23:21.942
Then what are you talking about?
Oh, my God, this is so classic Katrina!

23:22.026 --> 23:25.112
How would you like to be the governor?

23:25.195 --> 23:26.905
Whoa.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.866
-Of California?
-Yes, of California.

23:28.949 --> 23:31.452
Who's at the door? Is it pizza?

23:34.079 --> 23:35.831
Welcome back.
Your first meeting's at 10:00,

23:35.914 --> 23:37.249
and you have a lunch at 11:30.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.293
-Thank you, Judah.
-Also, I have someone on line two

23:39.376 --> 23:40.878
trying to get in touch
with BoJack Horseman.

23:40.961 --> 23:44.381
I have no idea how she got this number.
It sounds like it's a teenage girl.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.717
Tell her I don't work for BoJack.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.761
Mm-hmm. I'm sorry. We can't help you.
