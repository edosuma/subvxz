WEBVTT

00:08.110 --> 00:10.194
( theme music playing )

00:15.110 --> 00:18.319
And you feel a string
pulling you up top,

00:18.319 --> 00:21.235
and your feet
planting you
on the earth.

00:21.235 --> 00:23.569
- ( Leon exhales )
- And raise your arms up.

00:23.569 --> 00:26.194
If you can,
look up.

00:26.194 --> 00:29.319
Absorbing the energy
of the room.

00:29.319 --> 00:30.778
And come out of it.

00:30.778 --> 00:32.694
- Fantastic, yogis.
- ( Leon exhales, grunts )

00:32.694 --> 00:34.736
Now let's get down
to the floor.

00:34.736 --> 00:37.611
First, we'll start
on our shoulders

00:37.611 --> 00:39.486
and a little
shoulder stand.

00:39.486 --> 00:42.736
- Toes up to the sky...
- I would fuck her. Damn!

00:42.736 --> 00:44.694
- You like that?
- Fucking love that shit.

00:44.694 --> 00:46.611
- ( chuckles )
- Yeah.

00:46.611 --> 00:49.903
Tina:
And fold our legs
over into plow.

00:49.903 --> 00:52.486
And let's take
one more breath
together as a group.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.152
- ( Leon exhales )
- Inhale.

00:54.152 --> 00:56.736
- ( all inhaling )
- Take one more sip of air,

00:56.736 --> 00:59.486
and down
to heart's center,

00:59.486 --> 01:01.277
and namaste.

01:01.277 --> 01:03.444
All:
Namaste.

01:03.444 --> 01:05.611
Tina:
Thank you, yogis.
See you tomorrow.

01:05.611 --> 01:07.903
Thank you, yogi.
( chuckles )

01:09.152 --> 01:10.778
I wanted to do
the downward dog.

01:10.778 --> 01:12.486
That's my
favorite one.

01:12.486 --> 01:16.110
- You love that downward dog.
- Leon: I'm a big dog.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.319
- Excuse me.
Larry, was it?
- Larry: Yes.

01:18.319 --> 01:20.944
Um, I just noticed
that you didn't, uh,

01:20.944 --> 01:22.819
namaste
with the other yogis.

01:22.819 --> 01:25.486
Yeah,
not a namaste  guy.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.611
I don't participate
in group activities.

01:27.611 --> 01:29.402
You know, I don't sing
the birthday song.

01:29.402 --> 01:31.819
"Happy birthday to you",
you know, so, you know.

01:31.819 --> 01:33.653
Namaste  means
"the light within me

01:33.653 --> 01:35.402
greets the light
within you."

01:35.402 --> 01:38.194
There is no light within me,
that's the only problem there.

01:38.194 --> 01:39.861
Well, why don't you try it?
Why don't you just

01:39.861 --> 01:42.444
try a little namaste
and see how it feels?

01:42.444 --> 01:43.694
I know how
it's gonna feel.

01:43.694 --> 01:44.903
I'm gonna feel
like an idiot.

01:44.903 --> 01:46.152
Well, no one's
here now.

01:46.152 --> 01:47.569
Why don't you
just try it?

01:47.569 --> 01:49.152
My third eye
is watching.

01:49.152 --> 01:50.736
That's not how
the third eye works.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.694
You know how
the third eye works, huh?

01:52.694 --> 01:54.444
- I've studied it
for many years, yes.
- Is that so?

01:54.444 --> 01:56.235
Here, watch, here's what I
think about the third eye.

01:56.235 --> 01:58.110
- See? Look, I'm poking it.
- That's disrespectful.

01:58.110 --> 01:59.944
- Doesn't hurt at all.
- It's-- it's disrespectful.

01:59.944 --> 02:01.152
- Look. Yeah, yeah.
- It's disrespectful.

02:01.152 --> 02:02.861
Just don't do that
to your third eye.

02:02.861 --> 02:04.361
I wouldn't do it
to my two eyes,
the real eyes.

02:04.361 --> 02:05.861
Right, right.
The third eye's real.

02:05.861 --> 02:07.736
There's no-- there's no
imaginary eye there.

02:07.736 --> 02:09.486
- Are you familiar
with etiquette?
- By the way,

02:09.486 --> 02:11.152
- can I say something?
- Mm-hmm.

02:11.152 --> 02:12.527
It's really
hot in here.

02:12.527 --> 02:13.903
Well, it's
hot yoga.

02:13.903 --> 02:15.069
Does it have
to be this hot?

02:15.069 --> 02:16.235
I mean, it's,
you know--

02:16.235 --> 02:17.361
Larry,
you're here to be

02:17.361 --> 02:18.903
a part of our
spiritual community.

02:18.903 --> 02:21.569
No, I'm here because
I have a bad hamstring.

02:21.569 --> 02:25.319
If you're not gonna
acknowledge the light
within yourself,

02:25.319 --> 02:28.235
then you can leave.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.027
You can leave
and you cannot come back.

02:30.027 --> 02:31.069
Wow.

02:31.069 --> 02:32.778
That's very
"unyogi-ish" of you.

02:32.778 --> 02:35.903
- Get the fuck out.
- You just made my day.

02:35.903 --> 02:37.110
Okay.

02:37.110 --> 02:39.444
Namaste!

02:42.486 --> 02:45.027
( Leon chuckles )

02:45.027 --> 02:46.861
Guess whose
number I got.

02:47.903 --> 02:49.194
- Yogi Tina?
- Yeah.

02:49.194 --> 02:51.027
Nice!

02:51.027 --> 02:52.736
Guess who just
threw me out of class

02:52.736 --> 02:54.653
and told me
never to come back.

02:54.653 --> 02:58.027
- Yogi Tina?
- Yeah, Yogi Tina.

02:58.027 --> 03:00.277
- Oh, what?
- Yeah, kicked me out!

03:00.277 --> 03:03.402
- The fuck did you do?
- I wouldn't say namaste.

03:03.402 --> 03:05.235
Man, you gotta say
namaste,  man.

03:05.235 --> 03:07.152
Oh, get
the fuck out of here.
That's so stupid.

03:07.152 --> 03:09.319
You know what, it's
so goddamn hot in there,
I don't care.

03:09.319 --> 03:11.486
- That's what hot--
- Man, what are you doing?
I gotta back up.

03:11.486 --> 03:12.985
Back the fuck up.
You good!

03:12.985 --> 03:15.110
- Larry: I can't see shit!
- Leon: Fuckin-- whoa!

03:15.110 --> 03:16.819
Larry:
What the-- oh, shit!

03:16.819 --> 03:19.444
- Oh, fuck!
- ( music playing
over radio )

03:19.444 --> 03:22.486
- ( metal crunching )
- Larry: God damn it!

03:22.486 --> 03:24.611
You see? You know what?
This is all your fault!

03:24.611 --> 03:26.778
You fiddled with the radio
and the backup camera
didn't work.

03:26.778 --> 03:28.027
- You fucked up!
- No, you fucked up!

03:28.027 --> 03:29.110
No, no, no!
You fucked up!

03:29.110 --> 03:30.110
Don't blame me
for that shit!

03:32.778 --> 03:34.444
- Wow.
- Oh, geez.

03:34.444 --> 03:36.569
- You fucked
this car up good.
- Damn it.

03:36.569 --> 03:37.611
Look at that.

03:37.611 --> 03:39.778
That's bad.

03:39.778 --> 03:41.611
What you
gonna write?

03:41.611 --> 03:42.985
I'm gonna tell them
I'm sorry

03:42.985 --> 03:44.277
and leave my name
and, uh, number.

03:44.277 --> 03:46.444
- What else can I do?
- I wouldn't write shit!

03:46.444 --> 03:47.527
Just drive
the fuck off!

03:47.527 --> 03:48.736
I'm not
gonna do that!

03:48.736 --> 03:50.653
I follow
the golden rule, okay?

03:50.653 --> 03:52.611
"Do unto others
as you'd have others
do unto you."

03:52.611 --> 03:55.110
- The golden rule.
- I follow the golden rule, too.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.736
My friend Jasper's
golden.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.402
"Fuck them
or they'll fuck you."

03:58.402 --> 03:59.985
- Mm-hmm.
- Interesting rule.

03:59.985 --> 04:00.819
Yeah.

04:06.152 --> 04:08.985
Susie: Thankfully,
Victor's doing better,
so the wedding's on.

04:08.985 --> 04:11.861
- The wedding is happening.
- Wow. Oh, boy.

04:11.861 --> 04:15.486
- What?
- I would be
a little concerned

04:15.486 --> 04:17.152
- if it was my daughter.
- Well, you know,

04:17.152 --> 04:19.027
there's no accounting
for who's attracted to--

04:19.027 --> 04:20.319
look, I'm attracted
to Jeff.

04:20.319 --> 04:21.985
Go figure that one.

04:21.985 --> 04:23.402
Or, oh,

04:23.402 --> 04:24.402
listen to this--

04:24.402 --> 04:25.861
speaking of taste.

04:25.861 --> 04:27.778
I have a friend
who asked us a favor

04:27.778 --> 04:28.985
if I could
set her up with you.

04:30.402 --> 04:31.569
What?
What's this?

04:31.569 --> 04:33.736
- Yes. Yes.
- Really?

04:33.736 --> 04:35.819
Now I told her--
I read her chapter on verse

04:35.819 --> 04:37.402
on what an asshole
you are,

04:37.402 --> 04:38.611
and what
a horrible idea,

04:38.611 --> 04:40.486
but she would hear
none of it.

04:40.486 --> 04:41.944
She wants
to go out with you.

04:41.944 --> 04:43.569
Do-does she know
about the fatwa?

04:43.569 --> 04:45.235
Yeah,
and guess what?

04:45.235 --> 04:47.319
That turned her on!

04:47.319 --> 04:49.110
Hmm. Is she
good-looking?

04:49.110 --> 04:50.569
Yeah, very pretty.

04:50.569 --> 04:52.027
Like to see
a picture.

04:52.027 --> 04:53.527
( chuckles )

04:53.527 --> 04:55.277
You want to see
a picture?

04:55.277 --> 04:57.985
Who the fuck are you
to ask for a picture
of anybody?

04:57.985 --> 05:00.361
- ( laughs )
- Y-you are on
an Uber rating,

05:00.361 --> 05:01.819
you're like a--
a two.

05:01.819 --> 05:03.569
- A two?
- On a good day.
On a good day!

05:03.569 --> 05:05.861
- Fuck you!
A two, okay?
- Yeah.

05:05.861 --> 05:07.027
- Yeah.
- ( chuckles )

05:07.027 --> 05:08.569
I'm a four, baby!

05:08.569 --> 05:11.110
- I'm an Uber four.
- You are so delusional.

05:11.110 --> 05:12.611
- I'm delusional?
- Yes!

05:12.611 --> 05:14.361
Let me tell you something,
if I was a two,

05:14.361 --> 05:15.569
I would kill myself.

05:15.569 --> 05:18.069
I-- I could not live
on this planet as a two.

05:18.069 --> 05:19.611
Hi, Jeffy.

05:19.611 --> 05:22.694
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:22.694 --> 05:26.235
Did you call your friend
about the-- about the car?

05:26.235 --> 05:28.653
- It's good to have
a mechanic as a friend.
- Jeff: Sorry about that.

05:28.653 --> 05:31.069
- ( touch tones beeping )
- You know this Bridget
friend of hers?

05:31.069 --> 05:32.527
Yeah.

05:32.527 --> 05:34.486
- She good looking?
- Bridget? Beautiful.

05:34.486 --> 05:35.903
- Really?
- Beautiful.

05:35.903 --> 05:36.861
Great girl.

05:36.861 --> 05:38.402
Great sense of humor.

05:38.402 --> 05:40.903
He would be lucky to have her,
I'll tell you that much.

05:40.903 --> 05:42.444
And she lucky
to have him.

05:42.444 --> 05:43.944
That's--
that's the pal!

05:43.944 --> 05:45.319
What's wrong
with you?

05:45.319 --> 05:46.903
I-- I tried to
talk her out of it.

05:46.903 --> 05:48.903
I got, uh,
my friend Larry.

05:48.903 --> 05:51.277
All right, I'm gonna
put you on speakerphone.
All right.

05:51.277 --> 05:54.277
- Hey, Greg.
- Greg: Hey,
what's going on?

05:54.277 --> 05:55.944
Oh, not much.

05:55.944 --> 05:57.653
How is it, uh,
we've never met?

05:57.653 --> 05:59.235
Why is Jeff
keeping us apart?

05:59.235 --> 06:00.653
I have no clue.

06:00.653 --> 06:02.486
He said nothing
but wonderful things about you.

06:02.486 --> 06:03.778
I feel like
I know you already.

06:03.778 --> 06:05.694
Yeah, he's told me a lot
about you, too.

06:05.694 --> 06:07.069
Yeah, how's it going?

06:07.069 --> 06:08.778
Anyway,
this car, I--

06:08.778 --> 06:11.319
something happened
to my fender or bumper
or whatever.

06:11.319 --> 06:12.819
I banged into someone,
and, uh,

06:12.819 --> 06:15.235
- can I bring it over?
- Absolutely.

06:15.235 --> 06:16.819
Bring it by now,
as a matter of fact,

06:16.819 --> 06:18.194
and we can have it
hammered out maybe

06:18.194 --> 06:19.235
in the next couple days.

06:19.235 --> 06:21.277
Wow, okay. Great.

06:21.277 --> 06:23.444
- Doesn't even do that for me.
- Larry: Huh.

06:23.444 --> 06:25.110
All right,
I'll see you soon.
Thank you.

06:25.110 --> 06:27.611
- No problem.
- Larry: The-- the picture.

06:27.611 --> 06:30.069
- Can we get
the picture going?
- What picture?

06:30.069 --> 06:32.069
Susie: What, of Bridget?
You're not getting
a fucking picture.

06:32.069 --> 06:33.985
- Trust me.
- You know,
can I just say, Larry...

06:33.985 --> 06:36.569
- Trust me.
- ...not only is she
a beautiful woman,

06:36.569 --> 06:39.611
but more important,
inner beauty.

06:39.611 --> 06:40.944
That I'm not
interested in.

06:40.944 --> 06:42.985
- Asshole.
- Yeah.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.444
- All right.
- See you later.

06:44.444 --> 06:46.694
( drill whirring )

06:48.569 --> 06:49.903
- Oh, hey.
- How you doing?

06:49.903 --> 06:52.027
- I'm looking for Greg.
- Ah, I'm Greg.

06:52.027 --> 06:54.861
- Oh, hey, L-Larry.
Jeff's friend.
- Oh!

06:54.861 --> 06:57.653
- We, uh--
we talked on the phone.
- On the phone, yeah, yeah.

06:57.653 --> 06:59.819
- How you doing?
Nice to meet you.
- Eh, you're black.

06:59.819 --> 07:01.861
- Ye-- yes.
- Ah.

07:01.861 --> 07:03.653
Yes, I'm--
is that a problem?

07:03.653 --> 07:06.152
- No, of course not.
- Okay, good.

07:06.152 --> 07:07.444
Just surprised
Jeff didn't mention it.

07:07.444 --> 07:09.110
Why would he
have to mention it?

07:09.110 --> 07:10.653
Eh, because most
white people with
black friends

07:10.653 --> 07:12.653
like to show off
about it, that's all.

07:12.653 --> 07:14.235
Well, I can see
I've offended you.

07:14.235 --> 07:16.486
That-- b-believe me,
that wasn't my intention.

07:16.486 --> 07:18.611
- Ah, well.
- Yeah, I'm not, uh--

07:18.611 --> 07:21.277
I'm not prejudiced
in any way...

07:21.277 --> 07:23.903
- I-- I get it.
- ...towards any group,
except my own, of course.

07:23.903 --> 07:27.527
All right, uh,
we've gotten off
on the wrong foot, obviously.

07:27.527 --> 07:29.235
Um, let's talk
about the car.

07:29.235 --> 07:30.653
- Yes, let's. Okay.
- Okay.

07:30.653 --> 07:32.736
There's a problem
with the, uh,

07:32.736 --> 07:34.319
the fender,
like I said, yeah.

07:34.319 --> 07:35.819
Ah, well,
that's a bumper.

07:35.819 --> 07:38.361
And yes, there's
a problem with it.

07:38.361 --> 07:40.944
All right, so, um,
how long you think
it'll take?

07:40.944 --> 07:42.361
You know,
we'll call you.

07:42.361 --> 07:44.361
I don't-- yeah.
We'll call you.

07:44.361 --> 07:45.903
Any loaners?

07:45.903 --> 07:47.361
Nope.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.194
All right.

07:50.194 --> 07:51.069
I'll call an Uber.

07:53.194 --> 07:55.778
Again, sorry if I, uh,
offended you in any way.

07:55.778 --> 07:58.069
You know what...

07:58.069 --> 07:59.861
Okay.

08:02.569 --> 08:03.985
All right.
Okay, yeah.

08:06.277 --> 08:09.235
You have, uh, water
an chewing gums,
if you like.

08:09.235 --> 08:11.903
Yeah?
Well, that's
very nice of you.

08:11.903 --> 08:14.152
- Where you from?
- I am from Romania.

08:14.152 --> 08:15.235
- Romania?
- Yeah.

08:15.235 --> 08:16.444
Ah. Bucharest?

08:16.444 --> 08:17.569
Ah, you know
Bucharest?

08:17.569 --> 08:18.944
Yeah,
you like that, huh?

08:18.944 --> 08:21.110
- I know my geography.
- Very nice. You do.

08:21.110 --> 08:22.819
Yeah, most people
would say Budapest.

08:22.819 --> 08:24.319
- Yeah.
- So, let me
ask you a question.

08:24.319 --> 08:26.486
I was having
a little dispute
with my friend,

08:26.486 --> 08:30.903
um, as to what
my Uber rating
would be, looks-wise,

08:30.903 --> 08:32.319
from a scale
of one to five.

08:32.319 --> 08:33.736
If you were gonna
fix me up with
your sister--

08:33.736 --> 08:35.611
- do you have a sister?
- I do.

08:35.611 --> 08:37.319
Okay, so if you were
gonna fix me up with her,

08:37.319 --> 08:39.235
what, uh--
what would you
rate me looks-wise?

08:39.235 --> 08:40.903
- Just curious.
- One to five?

08:40.903 --> 08:42.361
Yeah.

08:42.361 --> 08:43.736
Okay, I am
very honest.

08:43.736 --> 08:45.486
I am an
honest person.

08:45.486 --> 08:46.903
So I will be
honest with you.

08:46.903 --> 08:48.527
You are a two.

08:48.527 --> 08:50.110
- A two?
- Two.

08:50.110 --> 08:52.361
- You gotta be kidding.
- You are older.

08:52.361 --> 08:54.277
- You have few hairs.
- Two?

08:54.277 --> 08:56.778
- Yes.
- I'm not a two,
okay, buddy?

08:56.778 --> 08:58.861
- I'm not a two.
- You live in a fantasy world.

08:58.861 --> 09:00.944
What do you think you are?
What do you think you are?

09:00.944 --> 09:02.861
- Four.
- ( laughs )
A four?!

09:02.861 --> 09:04.736
- Yeah, four.
- A four? I am a three.

09:04.736 --> 09:06.152
- How can you be a four?
- You're a three?

09:06.152 --> 09:07.944
Of course.
I am honest.

09:07.944 --> 09:09.778
I know,
my face is average.

09:09.778 --> 09:11.319
I drive Uber.
I'm a three.

09:11.319 --> 09:13.235
Well, I completely
disagree.

09:13.235 --> 09:14.611
Anyway, you know,
you're from one of the most

09:14.611 --> 09:16.944
unattractive countries,
you know, on the planet.

09:16.944 --> 09:19.110
- No, you don't know what
you're talking about, okay?
- It's all skewed

09:19.110 --> 09:22.027
'cause all you've seen
are unattractive people
your entire life.

09:22.027 --> 09:23.611
So I have to take it
with a grain of salt.

09:23.611 --> 09:25.944
Excuse me,
have you ever been
to the beaches in Mamaia?

09:25.944 --> 09:28.778
Have you seen the women
on the beaches in--
no, you have not.

09:28.778 --> 09:31.277
- Well--
- They're some of the most
beautiful in all of Europe.

09:31.277 --> 09:32.903
Oh, don't-- please,
don't make me laugh.

09:32.903 --> 09:34.819
You're thinking, maybe,
of mountain women.

09:34.819 --> 09:36.319
Okay?
I am not
talking about mou--

09:36.319 --> 09:38.110
I'm talking about
lowland women.

09:38.110 --> 09:41.152
Women of the plains.
The most beautiful
in all of Europe.

09:41.152 --> 09:42.694
- In Romania.
- Okay.

09:42.694 --> 09:44.027
- Okay.
- Yeah.

09:44.027 --> 09:45.819
( phone ringing )

09:47.152 --> 09:48.736
- Hello?
- Man: Larry?

09:48.736 --> 09:50.361
- Yeah?
- This is Justin Brown.

09:50.361 --> 09:53.235
- You, uh-- you hit my car.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:53.235 --> 09:55.778
I'm, uh--
I'm awfully sorry.

09:55.778 --> 09:57.319
Uh, obviously
you got my note.

09:57.319 --> 09:59.653
No, I guessed your number.
Yeah, I got your note.

09:59.653 --> 10:01.778
Look, I really wish
you had hung around
and stayed.

10:01.778 --> 10:03.152
This is, uh--
this is something

10:03.152 --> 10:04.527
that could've been resolved
far earlier.

10:04.527 --> 10:06.985
Well, uh, again,
I apologize.

10:06.985 --> 10:08.361
It was an accident.

10:08.361 --> 10:10.277
Uh, don't I get any credit
for the note?

10:10.277 --> 10:11.778
No, you get zero credit
for leaving a note.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.152
Anyone knows
to leave a note.

10:13.152 --> 10:14.361
A real person
would've hung around

10:14.361 --> 10:15.486
and dealt with this
in person.

10:15.486 --> 10:16.694
It was an accident.

10:16.694 --> 10:18.027
Next time,
I won't leave a note.

10:18.027 --> 10:19.569
- How 'bout that?
- Look, Larry,

10:19.569 --> 10:20.985
you seem like
a complete garbage person.

10:20.985 --> 10:22.402
How are you gonna
pay for this, asshole?

10:22.402 --> 10:24.027
Okay, fuckface,
I'll tell you what.

10:24.027 --> 10:25.985
I will text you
my address.

10:25.985 --> 10:27.527
We don't need to go
through insurance.

10:27.527 --> 10:29.110
And, uh,
we'll set up a time.

10:29.110 --> 10:30.402
You'll come over
and I'll give you a check.

10:30.402 --> 10:31.527
- How's that?
- Fine, but I'm getting

10:31.527 --> 10:32.985
an estimate
from the dealer.

10:32.985 --> 10:34.319
All right,
I-I've had enough of you.

10:34.319 --> 10:35.861
Goodbye.

10:37.527 --> 10:38.694
Fucking asshole.

10:38.694 --> 10:40.319
Hey, could you
do me a favor?

10:40.319 --> 10:41.903
It's about
900 degrees in here.

10:41.903 --> 10:43.402
Could-- could you
turn the heat down
a little bit?

10:43.402 --> 10:45.486
- I'm starting to sweat.
- No.

10:46.861 --> 10:48.235
Larry:
So, I play with Jeff

10:48.235 --> 10:50.194
and a few other guys
most weekends.

10:50.194 --> 10:51.402
At the--
at the country club?

10:51.402 --> 10:53.027
- That's so cute.
- Yeah.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.069
Country club.
That's an odd-sounding word.

10:55.069 --> 10:57.194
Isn't that
what it is, though?
To be honest.

10:57.194 --> 10:58.985
What do you call it?
You try to, like,

10:58.985 --> 11:00.235
make it seem
less fancy.

11:00.235 --> 11:02.235
- At the, uh...
- Uh, golf place.

11:02.235 --> 11:05.027
- Yeah, at the playground.
I meet some of my friends.
- Yeah.

11:07.903 --> 11:09.444
That's very funny.

11:09.444 --> 11:11.444
- You're
kind of funny.
- Oh, wow.

11:11.444 --> 11:14.235
Yeah, I think we're having
kind of a good date here,
don't you think?

11:14.235 --> 11:15.778
- I told Susie...
- Yeah.

11:15.778 --> 11:17.152
...and, boy, did she try
to talk me out of it, but--

11:17.152 --> 11:18.861
She's not a--
not a big fan of mine.

11:18.861 --> 11:21.235
I think the nicest thing
she called you was quirky.

11:21.235 --> 11:24.611
- All she told me about you
was you're an NBC censor.
- Yes.

11:24.611 --> 11:27.444
I see a lot of
dirty words.

11:27.444 --> 11:29.778
- I'll bet.
- It's amazing
what, you know--

11:29.778 --> 11:30.944
what they try
to get away with.

11:30.944 --> 11:32.486
Yeah?
Like what?

11:32.486 --> 11:34.944
They try to get
the penises in,

11:34.944 --> 11:36.861
and the pussy.

11:36.861 --> 11:39.361
Wet pussy,
tight pussy,
hot pussy.

11:39.361 --> 11:41.694
You know, cock,
balls, tits.

11:41.694 --> 11:43.819
You know,
and after a while,

11:43.819 --> 11:45.486
at the end of the day,
I just--

11:45.486 --> 11:46.985
I just
give it to them.

11:46.985 --> 11:48.319
- Yeah.
- You know?

11:48.319 --> 11:50.235
I can't fight off
the penis forever.

11:50.235 --> 11:52.110
- Just let it in.
- Yeah.

11:52.110 --> 11:54.486
Let it just
slip right in.

11:54.486 --> 11:56.110
Okay.

11:56.110 --> 11:58.402
Larry:
What a fantastic date.

11:58.402 --> 12:00.819
- Not one pause,
not one low.
- No.

12:00.819 --> 12:02.653
The conversations
just move and move.

12:02.653 --> 12:03.736
Great.

12:03.736 --> 12:06.319
In fact,
if I were to go home

12:06.319 --> 12:08.819
and get a phone call
from a friend, okay?

12:08.819 --> 12:10.402
- You-- you be my friend.
Go ahead.
- Okay.

12:10.402 --> 12:12.444
Larry, hey,
I heard you
went out on a date.

12:12.444 --> 12:14.736
- How was it?
- Oh, fantastic.

12:14.736 --> 12:15.903
Really?
Fantastic?

12:15.903 --> 12:17.819
- Really fantastic.
- Wow.

12:17.819 --> 12:20.402
- Really like her a lot.
- Oh!

12:20.402 --> 12:22.069
Not kidding.
And you know what?

12:22.069 --> 12:23.444
She wears glasses.

12:23.444 --> 12:26.277
I love glasses
on a woman.

12:26.277 --> 12:29.235
Oh, she's--
she's pretty
and smart, sexy.

12:29.235 --> 12:31.527
Oh, I'm really a little--
I'm quite--

12:31.527 --> 12:33.110
I'm a little smitten.
I'm a little smitten.

12:33.110 --> 12:34.736
Larry, I haven't
heard you s--

12:34.736 --> 12:37.027
- talk this way in a long time.
- Yes. I know, I know.

12:37.027 --> 12:38.903
- I really like this woman.
- I'm happy for you.

12:38.903 --> 12:40.319
You know,
a couple of things.

12:40.319 --> 12:41.653
Of course,
nobody's perfect.

12:41.653 --> 12:43.653
She-- she has
a strange way

12:43.653 --> 12:45.152
of holding silverware
like a pencil.

12:45.152 --> 12:47.361
She holds it like a pencil.
That I've never seen before.

12:47.361 --> 12:49.778
- That's annoying.
- Yeah, and she keeps
the window open in the car.

12:49.778 --> 12:53.110
- Ugh, air.
- You know, my--
the big question tonight was,

12:53.110 --> 12:55.527
- "Well, how am I gonna end it?
How am I gonna..."
- Mm-hmm.

12:55.527 --> 12:57.027
- "...am I gonna
make a move?"
- Mmm.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.694
Moves, they're tough.
How do you do it?

12:58.694 --> 12:59.861
It's a very
difficult thing.

12:59.861 --> 13:01.985
Wow. So, uh,
what happened?

13:01.985 --> 13:05.235
- Well, I went in
for a-- a kiss.
- Yeah.

13:05.235 --> 13:06.694
You know, and--

13:06.694 --> 13:07.985
Boy:
Who are you?

13:07.985 --> 13:09.486
Oh!

13:09.486 --> 13:11.194
Bridget:
Ah. Hi.

13:11.194 --> 13:13.736
Larry, this is my son Eddie,
that I was telling you about.

13:13.736 --> 13:15.444
- Yeah.
- I didn't think
you were up.

13:15.444 --> 13:17.069
Eddie, this is
our friend Larry.

13:17.069 --> 13:19.194
- Hey.
- Why is Mom
going out with you?

13:19.194 --> 13:21.736
- Bridget: Oh...
- Yeah, no, that's
a very good question, Eddie.

13:21.736 --> 13:23.985
Very good question.
I don't know.

13:23.985 --> 13:25.319
Your head is so shiny.

13:25.319 --> 13:27.944
Bridget:
Okay, honey.
Now, come on.

13:27.944 --> 13:29.611
How 'bout a--
go grab a snack.

13:29.611 --> 13:32.736
- I'm getting a donut.
- No, get something healthy.

13:32.736 --> 13:34.444
( sighs )

13:34.444 --> 13:36.027
And then her son
came down...

13:36.027 --> 13:38.778
- ( chuckles ) So...
- ...and he insulted me.

13:38.778 --> 13:41.402
You know,
and that was the end
of the night, pretty much.

13:41.402 --> 13:43.903
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, no sweat.

13:43.903 --> 13:45.152
He, um...

13:45.152 --> 13:46.361
( whispers )
he has Asperger's.

13:46.361 --> 13:48.110
Ah, Asperger.

13:48.110 --> 13:50.736
- Yeah, he's
on the spectrum.
- Wow. Spectrum?

13:50.736 --> 13:52.569
- Mm-hmm.
- Eddie: Why are these
chocolate sprinkles?

13:52.569 --> 13:53.861
- On the spectrum?
- Mm-hmm.

13:53.861 --> 13:55.194
I only eat
rainbow sprinkles!

13:55.194 --> 13:56.985
I'm so sorry,
but I gotta...

13:56.985 --> 13:58.736
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Ca-call me.

13:58.736 --> 14:00.486
- Okay? M'kay.
- Oh, sure, yeah.

14:00.486 --> 14:02.319
Hey, it was
really fun.

14:02.319 --> 14:03.819
Yeah. Nice. Okay.

14:03.819 --> 14:05.569
You'll-- you'll
find the door.

14:05.569 --> 14:06.611
I'm coming, honey.

14:09.778 --> 14:11.152
Why didn't you tell me
he was black?

14:11.152 --> 14:12.569
What does it matter?

14:12.569 --> 14:13.736
No, it doesn't
matter at all.

14:13.736 --> 14:15.027
You know,
'cause when I got there,

14:15.027 --> 14:16.361
I was surprised
and I blurted something out

14:16.361 --> 14:18.402
and the whole thing
was a disaster.

14:18.402 --> 14:20.152
- What did you blurt out?
- I said I didn't know
you were black.

14:20.152 --> 14:22.444
- Why'd you do that?!
- Because I was surprised.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.944
What were you
surprised about?

14:24.944 --> 14:28.110
Because he didn't sound
black on the phone, okay?!

14:29.152 --> 14:31.277
- Where's Susie?
- Upstairs.

14:31.277 --> 14:33.152
I do know what
he's talking about.

14:33.152 --> 14:36.819
( mumbling )
So stupid.

14:43.027 --> 14:45.402
Oh, Jesus Christ!
What are you doing up here?

14:45.402 --> 14:48.277
This is upstairs.
You don't come upstairs
in somebody's house.

14:48.277 --> 14:50.569
- W-why? What's
so special about--
- This is my boudoir!

14:50.569 --> 14:52.444
It's off-limits!

14:52.444 --> 14:53.778
Off-limits!

14:53.778 --> 14:55.903
Would Mrs. Cleaver

14:55.903 --> 14:57.569
talk that way
to Eddie Haskell

14:57.569 --> 14:59.527
if he came upstairs
to her-- to her bedroom?

14:59.527 --> 15:00.736
Oh, I think so.

15:00.736 --> 15:02.944
Mrs. Cleaver
hated Eddie Haskell

15:02.944 --> 15:05.152
'cause Eddie Haskell
was a kiss-ass,

15:05.152 --> 15:06.861
obsequious,
little shit.

15:06.861 --> 15:08.361
I think he had access
to the house.

15:08.361 --> 15:10.235
But that's because
the boys were upstairs.

15:10.235 --> 15:13.027
Okay, so
all I'm asking for
is Haskell-access.

15:13.027 --> 15:16.235
I want the same--
I want the same privileges
as Eddie Haskell!

15:16.235 --> 15:17.861
- Okay, number one--
- Is that asking too much?!

15:17.861 --> 15:19.194
What are you
doing here anyway?

15:19.194 --> 15:20.361
Why didn't you
tell me

15:20.361 --> 15:23.110
that her kid had...

15:24.819 --> 15:26.819
- you know.
- What?

15:26.819 --> 15:30.486
Ass... Ass...

15:30.486 --> 15:32.402
- What?
- Asper...

15:32.402 --> 15:34.694
- Asperger's.
Yeah, what about it?
- Asperger's.

15:34.694 --> 15:36.611
- Why didn't I tell you?
- Yeah, why didn't you tell me?

15:36.611 --> 15:38.486
Wha-- why should I
have told you?

15:38.486 --> 15:40.527
- You could've
mentioned it.
- I set you up on a date.

15:40.527 --> 15:43.277
You should be lucky
that I even did that for you.

15:43.277 --> 15:45.402
- So, how did it go?
- Pretty damn good.

15:45.402 --> 15:46.444
Really like her.

15:46.444 --> 15:47.736
- Good.
- What she say about me?

15:47.736 --> 15:49.985
( stammering )
She had a good time.

15:51.861 --> 15:54.235
- That's it?
- Mm, she li-- yeah.

15:54.235 --> 15:56.653
- ( chuckles ) What?
- She-- she's had a good time.

15:56.653 --> 15:58.611
- That's all she said?
- That's all she said.

15:58.611 --> 16:00.444
I'll tell you what.

16:00.444 --> 16:02.194
- I was about to make a move
on the couch...
- Yeah?

16:02.194 --> 16:04.277
...and that
little prick son
ruined it for me.

16:04.277 --> 16:06.736
Aw.
My heart
is breaking.

16:06.736 --> 16:08.402
All right, go!
Just leave.

16:08.402 --> 16:09.736
Okay, but I
can't get home.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.402
The Uber's not
picking me up,
for some reason.

16:11.402 --> 16:13.944
Yeah, well, walk.
Get the fuck out!
Go now!

16:13.944 --> 16:17.486
Has Jeff seen you
in those curlers of late?

16:17.486 --> 16:19.110
Get! Out!
Out! Out!

16:19.110 --> 16:21.653
Oh, what
a fucking asshole.

16:25.903 --> 16:27.903
Oh, finally.

16:27.903 --> 16:28.778
The hell is this?

16:31.819 --> 16:34.235
- This an Uber?
- UberX.

16:38.486 --> 16:40.486
( exhales )

16:40.486 --> 16:41.903
Took quite a while.

16:41.903 --> 16:44.736
( chuckles )
Okay.

16:44.736 --> 16:47.569
- Am I wrong?
- Kind of took a gamble
picking you up

16:47.569 --> 16:49.736
- with that
one-star rating.
- What?

16:49.736 --> 16:51.194
Yeah.

16:51.194 --> 16:52.402
You know,
usually I, uh--

16:52.402 --> 16:54.277
I pick up four,
five stars.

16:54.277 --> 16:55.778
I know they're
gonna be responsible,

16:55.778 --> 16:57.069
respectful of the car,

16:57.069 --> 16:58.235
not be a problem.

16:58.235 --> 16:59.736
- But...
- One star?

16:59.736 --> 17:02.277
( stammering )
I'm not one star.

17:02.277 --> 17:04.361
- I'm a five.
- You might feel
like a five,

17:04.361 --> 17:06.361
but Uber says
you're a one, buddy.

17:08.235 --> 17:10.069
Larry:
Holy shit.

17:11.194 --> 17:12.444
Four other stars
next to it,

17:12.444 --> 17:13.444
not filled in.

17:13.444 --> 17:14.694
The Romanian!

17:14.694 --> 17:16.611
- The Romanian?
- The Romanian.

17:16.611 --> 17:19.194
Gave me-- he gave me a one
and took me down from
a five to a one.

17:19.194 --> 17:22.944
- One-Star Larry is really, uh--
really not a popular guy.
- All right. Okay.

17:35.653 --> 17:37.277
( door opens )

17:37.277 --> 17:40.152
- ( door closes )
- ( Leon sighs ) Man.

17:40.152 --> 17:42.194
What the hell
is going on in here?

17:42.194 --> 17:45.194
- Phew.
- Huh? It's 92 degrees.

17:45.194 --> 17:46.611
You're damn right
it's 92 degrees.

17:46.611 --> 17:47.611
Tina came over.

17:47.611 --> 17:49.110
- Who?
- Yogi Tina.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.444
Like that shit hot.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.235
- Where is she?
- Fuck you think she's at?

17:52.235 --> 17:53.611
She's up there
fuckin' recuperating.

17:53.611 --> 17:54.861
What are you doing
in my house?

17:54.861 --> 17:57.444
I'm in here fuckin'
at 92 degrees.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.069
- What? You're what?
- That's what the fuck's
going on.

17:59.069 --> 18:01.110
Why are you having sex
in my house?

18:01.110 --> 18:03.361
- Because--
- ( stammering ) You got
a guest house back there.

18:03.361 --> 18:05.194
- I can't fuck...
- Huh?

18:05.194 --> 18:06.903
...at 92 degrees
in my room

18:06.903 --> 18:08.319
'cause my room
won't get hot enough.

18:08.319 --> 18:09.486
- Okay, well you--
- It gets hot in here.

18:09.486 --> 18:10.778
Well, you already
did it, right?

18:10.778 --> 18:12.569
- Now get out.
- No, I did part one.

18:12.569 --> 18:13.985
I didn't do part two
or three yet.

18:13.985 --> 18:16.444
Okay, there's not gonna be
a part two or three, okay?

18:16.444 --> 18:18.402
- There's always
a part two and three.
- No, no, no. No!

18:18.402 --> 18:20.653
I'm not gonna sit here
and leave her at
fuckin' part one.

18:20.653 --> 18:22.027
Well, why
is it 92 degrees?

18:22.027 --> 18:23.653
She's a yoga instructor.
She likes hot yoga.

18:23.653 --> 18:25.985
Oh, so she likes hot sex
and hot yoga, is that it?

18:25.985 --> 18:27.361
That's fuckin' right.
That's what the fuck
she does.

18:27.361 --> 18:29.110
I want you
out of the house.

18:29.110 --> 18:32.861
I don't want
some post-sex guy
walking around my house, okay?

18:32.861 --> 18:34.944
- Now get out.
- First of all,

18:34.944 --> 18:36.694
there's nothing wrong
with people having

18:36.694 --> 18:38.819
the scent of--
of fuck on their body.

18:38.819 --> 18:41.903
I don't like
the scent of fuck, okay?

18:41.903 --> 18:44.361
Sue me.
I don't like
fuck scent.

18:44.361 --> 18:47.027
All right, look, uh,
some guy named Greg
called for you.

18:47.027 --> 18:49.152
He said your car's
gonna be ready
in three weeks.

18:49.152 --> 18:52.319
Three weeks?
On the phone,
he said a couple of days.

18:52.319 --> 18:55.069
- Oh, wow.
- Well, di-did he sound
like he was ticked off?

18:55.069 --> 18:57.903
No, he just sounded like
some random black dude

18:57.903 --> 18:59.194
who's calling
about your car.

19:00.778 --> 19:03.277
- How do you know he's black?
- I know how black people sound.

19:03.277 --> 19:06.736
- You could tell
that guy was black?
- Fuck, yeah, instantly.

19:06.736 --> 19:08.444
- Wow.
- Three words. Bam.

19:08.444 --> 19:10.319
Jews, I could tell
within, like, a minute.

19:10.319 --> 19:11.985
- Man or woman.
- Of course, 'cause
you're Jewish.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.653
You-- you give me two minutes,
and I could tell you

19:13.653 --> 19:15.069
if they're reform
or conservative.

19:15.069 --> 19:17.152
Hmm.
Uh-oh.

19:17.152 --> 19:18.569
( chuckles )
Somebody recuperated.

19:18.569 --> 19:21.611
Oh, well,
well, well.

19:21.611 --> 19:24.235
- Look who's here.
- Hello, Larry.

19:24.235 --> 19:26.611
How's the temperature?
Is it to your liking?

19:26.611 --> 19:28.694
It's the optimal
temperature for climaxing.

19:28.694 --> 19:29.778
Larry:
Oh, is it?

19:29.778 --> 19:30.778
Leon:
Ha, ha, is it?

19:30.778 --> 19:33.235
You... are gonna
have to leave.

19:33.235 --> 19:35.694
- Such hospitality.
- Feels good?

19:35.694 --> 19:36.903
Namaste.

19:36.903 --> 19:38.277
Okay.
Now get the fuck out.

19:38.277 --> 19:40.235
I'm still gonna
nama-stick-it-in-her.

19:40.235 --> 19:41.778
Tell you that.

19:41.778 --> 19:43.152
Hold on.
Hold on, baby.

19:43.152 --> 19:44.903
Let me talk to you
real quick.

19:44.903 --> 19:47.027
- It's right over there.
- That looks nice.

19:47.027 --> 19:49.152
- Why are we going
to this place?
- Because...

19:49.152 --> 19:50.903
- It stinks.
- Highly recommended.

19:50.903 --> 19:53.110
They better have
a cheeseburger,
no condiments.

19:53.110 --> 19:55.402
- I don't like condiments.
- Is that so?

19:55.402 --> 19:57.944
- Hey, look at that guy.
- Larry: Yeah, look at
that guy.

19:57.944 --> 19:59.778
- Bridget: Wow.
- ( Larry scoffs )

19:59.778 --> 20:01.277
Free.
( chuckles )

20:01.277 --> 20:03.611
He'll be fine
once we get to
the restaurant.

20:03.611 --> 20:04.944
- Uh...
- So...

20:04.944 --> 20:06.486
Huh.

20:06.486 --> 20:07.819
- Thank you.
- Bye.

20:07.819 --> 20:09.361
- Larry: Well, well.
- Thank you.

20:09.361 --> 20:11.069
- Hey, you know what?
- What?

20:11.069 --> 20:11.944
I'll be right back.

20:15.361 --> 20:16.736
Oh, come on.

20:22.944 --> 20:24.069
A one?

20:24.069 --> 20:25.819
You gave me a one?

20:25.819 --> 20:27.944
- Honestly.
- I don't like the way
you spoke to me.

20:27.944 --> 20:29.277
You insulted--

20:29.277 --> 20:31.819
you insulted
the lowland women
of my country, okay?

20:31.819 --> 20:34.444
- You are asking me
to set you up with--
- Let's be honest about it.

20:34.444 --> 20:35.944
They're not the most
attractive group--

20:35.944 --> 20:37.194
You have--
you've never seen--

20:37.194 --> 20:38.861
you want me to pull up
pictures for you?

20:38.861 --> 20:40.361
I've seen
plenty of pictures
of Romanian women.

20:40.361 --> 20:42.319
And the Bulgarians,
and the Hungarians.

20:42.319 --> 20:43.361
No beauties.
Come on.

20:43.361 --> 20:44.944
First of all,

20:44.944 --> 20:46.736
do you hear
yourself talking?

20:46.736 --> 20:49.110
You are the rudest person
I've ever met.

20:49.110 --> 20:51.235
You are
an angry person, okay?

20:51.235 --> 20:52.819
And you ask me
to change the heat...

20:52.819 --> 20:54.819
Who's angry?
You're the one
who's angry, not me.

20:54.819 --> 20:57.152
- You're angry.
- You are making me
angry, my friend.

20:57.152 --> 21:00.694
I am not the one
insulting your culture,
your country, your women.

21:00.694 --> 21:03.694
I gave you a five.
I gave you a five.

21:03.694 --> 21:05.319
Of course, because
I gave you nice service.

21:05.319 --> 21:07.361
I take you where
you want to go,
quickest route.

21:07.361 --> 21:09.194
Okay, look, look,
I wanna ask you
a favor, okay?

21:09.194 --> 21:11.277
I can't get Ubers now
on account of you,

21:11.277 --> 21:12.653
so I want you
to change the rating.

21:12.653 --> 21:13.903
Oh, change
the rating?

21:13.903 --> 21:15.319
- Yeah.
- Okay.

21:15.319 --> 21:18.235
You want me to go
into the algorithm
and change it?

21:18.235 --> 21:20.903
Sure.
Oh, no problem.
Of course.

21:20.903 --> 21:23.985
Let me just open
a programming window
on my phone

21:23.985 --> 21:26.110
and enter some code
for you.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.444
What are you writing
over there?

21:27.444 --> 21:29.277
I'm just entering some notes
for other drivers.

21:29.277 --> 21:30.694
- What is that?
- Don't worry.

21:30.694 --> 21:32.194
( stammering )
I wanna see what
you're writing.

21:32.194 --> 21:34.194
- Get out of my car.
- Give me that cell phone.

21:34.194 --> 21:35.361
I'm not giving you
my cell phone.

21:35.361 --> 21:37.027
Don't touch
my cell phone.

21:37.027 --> 21:38.235
All right,
you know what?

21:38.235 --> 21:40.653
I'm changing
my rating of you.

21:40.653 --> 21:42.736
From a five
to a zero.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.361
- Okay, try it.
Take your phone out.
- Okay. Yeah, I will try it.

21:44.361 --> 21:46.778
Go ahead
because Uber ratings
are final, my friend.

21:46.778 --> 21:48.319
- They're final?!
- They are final.

21:48.319 --> 21:50.110
You know what
I regret the most?

21:50.110 --> 21:51.277
When I said to you,
"If you were gonna

21:51.277 --> 21:53.027
fix me up
with your sister,

21:53.027 --> 21:54.569
- what Uber rating
would you give me?"
- Yeah.

21:54.569 --> 21:56.027
I would never go out
with your sister

21:56.027 --> 21:57.361
under any
circumstances.

21:57.361 --> 21:59.361
My sister would not look
at a picture of you.

21:59.361 --> 22:02.277
- She's a gorgeous
Romanian woman.
- Gorgeous Romanian?

22:02.277 --> 22:03.611
That's an oxymoron.

22:03.611 --> 22:05.069
- Gorgeous Romanian.
- That's it.

22:05.069 --> 22:07.277
- No, what? Hey!
- You think that
I'm gonna--

22:07.277 --> 22:09.861
say something about
my sister again!

22:09.861 --> 22:12.152
( Larry scoffs )
And I'm telling you,

22:12.152 --> 22:13.736
I don't think
Bridget's kid
has Asperger's.

22:13.736 --> 22:16.277
I swear to God,
I just think he's
an asshole.

22:16.277 --> 22:20.402
- The kid's an asshole.
- I know a lot of people
with Asperger's, I do.

22:20.402 --> 22:21.694
Not a lot,
but I know some.

22:21.694 --> 22:23.569
And you know what,
they're delightful people.

22:23.569 --> 22:26.194
This kid,
I'm betting
you're right.

22:26.194 --> 22:28.569
- Asshole.
- I think so.

22:28.569 --> 22:30.444
You know,
to be honest with you,

22:30.444 --> 22:32.736
I'm gonna start telling people
that you're on the spectrum.

22:32.736 --> 22:36.402
- I could be.
- Any bad behavior
can be written off as what?

22:36.402 --> 22:37.569
- Spectrum.
- Spectrum.

22:37.569 --> 22:39.069
Hello, hello, hello.

22:39.069 --> 22:40.778
It's hot as fuckin' hell
in there, Larry.

22:40.778 --> 22:42.152
Well, I know.
The-- the heating's broken.

22:42.152 --> 22:44.110
And the heating guy's here.
He's fixing it.

22:44.110 --> 22:45.444
That's why we're
sitting out here.

22:45.444 --> 22:46.736
Oh, all right.
Well, listen,

22:46.736 --> 22:48.778
I'm going around
to all my friends

22:48.778 --> 22:51.110
and I'm giving them
these sample baskets.

22:51.110 --> 22:53.361
So maybe you could
give this one to Bridget.

22:53.361 --> 22:54.903
So-- so what did
she say about me?

22:54.903 --> 22:57.819
Come on, give me--
give me a little something.

22:57.819 --> 22:59.694
Huh?
What do you got?

22:59.694 --> 23:01.444
- What'd she say?
- She said to me...

23:01.444 --> 23:04.069
- Yeah.
- ...that she thinks
you're terrific.

23:04.069 --> 23:06.110
There you go!
Now you're talking!

23:06.110 --> 23:07.778
- You like her?
- I do.

23:07.778 --> 23:10.819
But that prick son
is driving me crazy.

23:10.819 --> 23:12.611
Ugh, you know what,
you've never had children.

23:12.611 --> 23:15.027
Every single time
you deal with a woman
with kids,

23:15.027 --> 23:16.110
you have a problem.

23:16.110 --> 23:18.110
I suggest
you foster a kid.

23:18.110 --> 23:19.444
( cackles )

23:22.653 --> 23:24.527
- Okay. I'll go--
- It'll make you
a better man.

23:24.527 --> 23:26.152
I'll go down
to the pound today.

23:26.152 --> 23:28.027
I'll go down--
I'll go down to
the foster pound.

23:28.027 --> 23:29.527
Would you come with me
to the foster pound?

23:29.527 --> 23:31.653
Always looking forward for
a trip to the foster pound.

23:31.653 --> 23:34.653
- Oh, it is
so hot in there.
- Yeah, I know.

23:34.653 --> 23:36.778
Yeah, it's, like,
stuck on 92 degrees.

23:36.778 --> 23:38.402
- I know.
- Man: Yeah.

23:38.402 --> 23:39.653
It's much nicer
out here.

23:39.653 --> 23:41.069
So what do you think?
How's it looking?

23:41.069 --> 23:43.235
Well, we're running
a system diagnostics test

23:43.235 --> 23:45.069
and, uh, you know,
we'll have our answer soon.

23:45.069 --> 23:47.152
Do you specialize
more in heating than
air-conditioning?

23:47.152 --> 23:49.152
Oh, we do both--
heat and AC.

23:49.152 --> 23:51.527
If I called you up and said
I have a particular problem,

23:51.527 --> 23:53.944
would you prefer if I said
heating or air-conditioning?

23:53.944 --> 23:55.861
- I have no preference.
- No preference at all?

23:55.861 --> 23:57.694
No preference at all.
You know, they're like--
you know, it's like children.

23:57.694 --> 24:00.027
Okay, like children.
Say you had a "Sophie's Choice."

24:00.027 --> 24:02.486
You have two children,
heating and air-conditioning.

24:02.486 --> 24:04.903
You have to pick one,
the one you had
an infinity for,

24:04.903 --> 24:08.778
and the other one goes into
the concentration camp.

24:08.778 --> 24:10.361
Which one--
which one you gonna keep?

24:12.235 --> 24:13.653
Heat.
Go with heat.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.944
So air conditioning's going
to the concentration camp.

24:15.944 --> 24:18.277
...going to
the concentration camp,
but heat is saved.

24:18.277 --> 24:20.235
( phone dings )

24:20.235 --> 24:22.194
Susie: You know,
our AC isn't working
that well either.

24:22.194 --> 24:25.319
- Larry: Ah, it's
from Bridget.
- Susie: Wow.

24:27.985 --> 24:31.235
What she see's in him,
I have no idea.

24:31.235 --> 24:34.110
Hey. Hey.
How long is this
gonna take?

24:34.110 --> 24:36.736
- I-- you gotta
get this done quickly.
- Yeah, I got some bad news.

24:36.736 --> 24:38.903
You got a broken part,
and it's gonna take
about three days.

24:38.903 --> 24:41.194
- I don't have it
on the truck. Yeah.
- What? Three days?

24:41.194 --> 24:43.069
Y-you were
so confident outside.

24:43.069 --> 24:45.027
- You said
you got it done.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

24:45.027 --> 24:47.361
- You said
you were a heat guy.
- I-- I am a heat guy.

24:47.361 --> 24:49.152
What you have
is a cooling problem.

24:49.152 --> 24:50.527
- Cooling?!
- Yeah.

24:50.527 --> 24:52.235
You sent the cooling kid
to the concentration camp.

24:52.235 --> 24:54.069
Okay, it's not
a kid, okay?

24:54.069 --> 24:55.444
It's chlorofluorocarbons.

24:55.444 --> 24:56.861
Okay, they're not--
they're not children.

24:56.861 --> 24:59.235
I did not send a child
to a concentration camp.

24:59.235 --> 25:00.736
Yeah, you know,
I was gonna consummate.

25:00.736 --> 25:02.235
I had a window open
to consummate.

25:02.235 --> 25:03.569
Now the window's
closed.

25:03.569 --> 25:05.152
- No consummation.
- Why is it closed?

25:05.152 --> 25:06.985
Well, I'm not
gonna have sex
in a 92-degree room.

25:06.985 --> 25:08.985
You get all sweaty.
There's-- it's disgusting.

25:08.985 --> 25:11.235
The sweat's on the sheets,
I have to take my shirt off.

25:11.235 --> 25:12.653
I'm not gonna have sex
with my shirt off.

25:12.653 --> 25:14.694
You don't take
your shirt off during sex?

25:14.694 --> 25:16.944
- No, I don't-- no.
- I take my shirt off
while I'm kissing.

25:16.944 --> 25:18.361
I love it.
I get completely free.

25:18.361 --> 25:20.361
All right.
I-- I don't really
know your name.

25:20.361 --> 25:21.861
You don't have one
of those little tags on...

25:21.861 --> 25:23.694
- No, we don't wear tags.
- I'll take a guess.

25:23.694 --> 25:26.277
- Uh, Bob?
- It's Bill.

25:26.277 --> 25:29.069
All right, Bill,
uh, let's not talk
about this anymore.

25:29.069 --> 25:30.527
All right, I'm sorry,
you brought it up.

25:30.527 --> 25:32.736
Yeah, I did.
I-- I gotta text her

25:32.736 --> 25:35.569
and tell her we can't--
she can't come over.

25:35.569 --> 25:37.277
- ( doorbell rings )
- Leon: I got it.

25:40.235 --> 25:42.110
I'm here
for my money, Lar--

25:42.110 --> 25:43.694
oh, my God.

25:43.694 --> 25:45.736
I'm Justin.
My car was the one,

25:45.736 --> 25:49.194
uh, damaged, um...
( chuckles )

25:49.194 --> 25:51.486
I'm sorry, I didn't kno--
I didn't know you were black.

25:51.486 --> 25:53.778
- Does it matter?
- No. God, no.

25:53.778 --> 25:56.694
No, like, that could
literally not matter less.

25:56.694 --> 25:58.402
Yeah, uh, um,

25:58.402 --> 26:00.778
you know,
this is the estimate
I got from the dealership,

26:00.778 --> 26:02.027
but, uh,
it seems high.

26:02.027 --> 26:05.694
And, uh,
like, the car,
it wasn't...

26:05.694 --> 26:07.778
( sighs )
You know, why don't--

26:07.778 --> 26:09.653
why don't I just
take care of this?

26:09.653 --> 26:11.444
We'll, uh--
we'll call this one good.

26:11.444 --> 26:13.486
I'm-- I'm really sorry
for the misunderstanding.

26:13.486 --> 26:15.527
Anyway, uh,
thank you for
leaving a note.

26:15.527 --> 26:17.110
That was really
considerate.
Thank you.

26:17.110 --> 26:18.819
- My man.
- My man. Thank you.

26:18.819 --> 26:20.819
- We good.
- Yeah. Yeah.
I'm sorry about--

26:20.819 --> 26:24.194
- I'm gonna go ahead
and take care-- okay.
- Yeah, yeah, we good.

26:24.194 --> 26:25.653
( door closes )

26:28.027 --> 26:29.110
Wow.

26:29.110 --> 26:30.402
- Huh?!
- Look at that.

26:30.402 --> 26:32.069
- That was beautiful.
- That was nice.

26:32.069 --> 26:33.985
- White people.
- Hey, man, white people.

26:33.985 --> 26:36.569
Gotta love 'em.
Namaste.

26:36.569 --> 26:38.027
Namaste  up in
this mother fucker.

26:41.152 --> 26:42.027
Hey, Greg.

26:43.152 --> 26:45.736
Ah...
hey, Larry.

26:45.736 --> 26:47.486
Yeah, um...

26:48.736 --> 26:51.402
I just came
to apologize

26:51.402 --> 26:52.527
for the other day.

26:52.527 --> 26:55.944
Thing is
that I didn't m--

26:55.944 --> 26:59.361
tell you was that
I have Asperger's.

26:59.361 --> 27:01.277
You have
Asperger's? Ah.

27:01.277 --> 27:03.152
Jeff never
mentioned anything,
I'm so sorry.

27:03.152 --> 27:04.402
Why would
he need to?

27:04.402 --> 27:06.152
Well, no, no, no, I--
he doesn't need to.

27:06.152 --> 27:08.152
You-- you're right.
I'm sorry.

27:08.152 --> 27:09.778
Um, how bad is it?

27:09.778 --> 27:11.611
Is-- I mean,
how mild or?

27:11.611 --> 27:13.944
No, I'm on the, uh--
I'm on the spectrum.

27:13.944 --> 27:15.444
You know, I have no--
I have no filter.

27:15.444 --> 27:16.778
I say whatever
comes into my head.

27:16.778 --> 27:18.444
You know, I have trouble
making eye contact.

27:18.444 --> 27:20.277
I-- I get it.
I-- you know what?

27:20.277 --> 27:22.152
We'll have the car
ready for you tomorrow.

27:22.152 --> 27:23.861
It's just a ding.
Free of charge.

27:23.861 --> 27:25.653
What?!
What? What?

27:25.653 --> 27:28.027
- Yeah, again,
I apologize so much.
- Yeah, yeah.

27:28.027 --> 27:29.194
- Tomorrow. Yeah.
- Sorry.

27:29.194 --> 27:30.277
He said he's sorry.
He's sorry.

27:30.277 --> 27:31.694
I-- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

27:31.694 --> 27:33.277
Yeah, he's really sorry.
He's sorry.

27:33.277 --> 27:34.694
Car will
be ready when?

27:34.694 --> 27:35.903
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

27:35.903 --> 27:37.444
- Free.
- S-see you tomorrow.

27:37.444 --> 27:38.903
Tomorrow.

27:38.903 --> 27:40.235
- T-t-- yeah,
tomorrow.
- Yeah.

27:40.235 --> 27:41.486
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow, tomorrow.

27:41.486 --> 27:43.486
- Yeah, okay.
- You need a ride?

27:43.486 --> 27:45.402
No, I'm a--
I'm a good driver.

27:45.402 --> 27:46.944
I'm a good driver.

27:49.110 --> 27:51.319
- Nice to be out, isn't it?
- I love this shit.

27:51.319 --> 27:53.778
- Out of that hot house?
- You can't take that shit.

27:53.778 --> 27:56.194
You a Anglo-Anglo
motherfucker.

27:56.194 --> 27:57.569
- ( phone dings )
- You know?

27:57.569 --> 28:00.069
Your body's not used to
that kind of temperature.

28:04.569 --> 28:05.611
( gasps )

28:05.611 --> 28:07.903
- The fuck is it?
- Bridget.

28:07.903 --> 28:09.611
- The-- the NBC censor.
- Yeah, yeah.

28:09.611 --> 28:12.110
I haven't had sex with her yet.
She invited me over
to her house.

28:12.110 --> 28:13.736
- We got an hour.
- Oh, man.

28:13.736 --> 28:15.235
- I got an hour window.
- An hour's a good fuck window.

28:15.235 --> 28:16.486
Fuck, I don't
have a car.

28:16.486 --> 28:17.527
I need to borrow
your car.

28:17.527 --> 28:18.569
- Mm-mmm.
- What?!

28:18.569 --> 28:19.611
You ain't
borrowing my car.

28:19.611 --> 28:20.903
- Why not?!
- I got a date.

28:20.903 --> 28:22.110
You're not gonna
give me your car?

28:22.110 --> 28:23.444
No! You're not getting
my fucking car.

28:23.444 --> 28:24.819
No, no, no.
Use the guest house.

28:24.819 --> 28:26.069
- The guest house?!
- Use that shit, man.

28:26.069 --> 28:27.235
That scum-shack?!

28:27.235 --> 28:28.277
You think I'm gonna
go in there?

28:28.277 --> 28:29.486
- Are you crazy?
- Scum-shack?

28:29.486 --> 28:30.985
There must have been
10,000 ejaculations

28:30.985 --> 28:32.277
in that place
in just two years.

28:32.277 --> 28:33.778
That means that room
is broken in.

28:33.778 --> 28:35.402
It's ready.
It's prime and
ready to fuck.

28:35.402 --> 28:37.569
Okay, fuck that.
All right, I'll tell you what.

28:37.569 --> 28:39.444
Okay, I'll
tell you what.

28:39.444 --> 28:40.861
I-- I can't do Uber,

28:40.861 --> 28:43.319
so just get--
get me an Uber.

28:43.319 --> 28:44.819
- No, fuck that.
- What?

28:44.819 --> 28:45.985
You gonna bring
my rating down.

28:45.985 --> 28:47.361
I'm a good five
right now.

28:47.361 --> 28:49.402
- I'm a five.
- No, no, you a fuckin' one.

28:49.402 --> 28:51.027
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
one idiot changed it
to a one.

28:51.027 --> 28:52.277
- No, no, no, no.
- That doesn't mean anything.

28:52.277 --> 28:53.569
You don't know
how to respect people.

28:53.569 --> 28:54.861
- You're a cocksucker.
- Fuck that.

28:54.861 --> 28:56.819
- I'm gonna take a bus.
- Yeah, you do that.

28:56.819 --> 28:58.152
- You a cocksucker!
- Hey!

28:58.152 --> 28:59.819
And your friendship rating
just went down!

28:59.819 --> 29:01.778
Hey! Hey!

29:03.027 --> 29:04.694
Hey!
No, no, no.

29:04.694 --> 29:07.361
Oh, come on.
Op-open the door!

29:09.611 --> 29:11.569
Does this go to
Olympic and Hauser?

29:11.569 --> 29:13.694
- Not all the way.
You gotta transfer.
- Transfer?

29:22.194 --> 29:23.402
What are you sitting
in the middle for?

29:23.402 --> 29:24.444
Why don't you
move over one?

29:24.444 --> 29:26.527
( speaking native
language )

29:26.527 --> 29:28.653
Okay, or whatever
you're saying,

29:28.653 --> 29:30.778
but it's-- it's
a little strange.

29:30.778 --> 29:32.402
I've never seen a person
sit in the middle.

29:32.402 --> 29:34.819
It's like using
the middle urinal.

29:34.819 --> 29:36.152
( speaking native
language )

29:38.819 --> 29:42.235
You know it's odd,
I-- I'm not sure if you
can understand me or not just--

29:42.235 --> 29:44.527
( speaking native
language )

29:44.527 --> 29:46.444
No, no,
you go over there.

29:46.444 --> 29:48.319
( speaking native
language )

29:48.319 --> 29:50.194
No, you sit there.
No, no.

29:50.194 --> 29:52.402
- ( imitating native language )
- ( speaking native language )

29:56.194 --> 29:57.694
Sir?

29:57.694 --> 29:59.027
Olympic and Hauser?

29:59.027 --> 30:01.569
I'm supposed
to go to, um-- sir?

30:01.569 --> 30:04.194
I'm supposed to go to,
uh, Olympic and Hauser.

30:04.194 --> 30:05.527
Yeah, well,
that's easy, man.

30:05.527 --> 30:07.027
Get off at
the La Cienega stop.

30:07.027 --> 30:08.194
You got
a couple options.

30:08.194 --> 30:09.944
Okay, will you tell me
when that's, uh--

30:09.944 --> 30:12.527
- when that's coming up?
- I'm not your babysitter.

30:12.527 --> 30:13.736
Figure it out.

30:15.027 --> 30:18.069
This bus is a very cold,
unforgiving place.

30:18.069 --> 30:19.361
I don't like it
one bit.

30:22.194 --> 30:24.069
Does this go to
Olympic and Hauser?

30:24.069 --> 30:25.903
Mm-hmm.

30:29.944 --> 30:31.069
Larry:
There you go.

30:31.069 --> 30:33.569
- To transfer, right?
- Yup.

30:33.569 --> 30:35.861
- Huh. Yeah, I did it.
- All right, you did it,

30:35.861 --> 30:37.235
but can you
do me a favor and get

30:37.235 --> 30:39.235
behind the yellow line
for your safety?

30:39.235 --> 30:40.736
- Thank you.
- Could you do me a favor

30:40.736 --> 30:43.444
and maybe go a little faster
than you normally might?

30:43.444 --> 30:45.110
I-- I cannot
do you that favor.

30:45.110 --> 30:48.903
Yellows.
If there's anyway that--
to ignore the yellows.

30:48.903 --> 30:50.569
Sir, I'm not
ignoring any yellows.

30:50.569 --> 30:52.694
- I-- I understand but people--
- Have a seat. Have a seat.

30:52.694 --> 30:55.069
People pay
a little too much
attention to yellows and--

30:55.069 --> 30:57.694
I am driving this bus.
I don't wanna hear
no more back talk.

30:57.694 --> 30:59.985
- ( stammering )
There's not another route?
- Man: Sit down!

30:59.985 --> 31:01.819
- There is not another route.
- Hey, shush down here
for a second.

31:01.819 --> 31:03.444
I got some
personal business.

31:03.444 --> 31:04.903
Driver:
You gonna
make me crazy now.

31:04.903 --> 31:06.444
Do you wanna drive
this bus, sir?

31:06.444 --> 31:08.402
- Is that an option?
- No, it's not an option.

31:08.402 --> 31:10.486
I'ma need you to go
and sit the hell down.

31:10.486 --> 31:11.778
This is danger.
Come and sit!

31:11.778 --> 31:13.819
Hey, this is none
of your business, okay?

31:13.819 --> 31:15.985
Just-- just take it easy.
I-- I've got a--

31:15.985 --> 31:17.694
- Man: Sit down!
- All: Sit down!

31:17.694 --> 31:19.527
Sit your ass down!

31:19.527 --> 31:23.027
Get behind
the yellow line
and sit down.

31:23.027 --> 31:25.736
- ( metal thuds )
- Shit.

31:25.736 --> 31:27.778
- You no listen!
- Man: You clipped a mirror.

31:27.778 --> 31:29.110
No shit, Sherlock.

31:31.611 --> 31:33.110
What's going on?
What are you doing?

31:33.110 --> 31:34.653
- I gotta pull over.
- What? Pull over?

31:34.653 --> 31:36.653
- Are you kidding? Why?
- Yeah. I have to leave a note.

31:36.653 --> 31:38.527
- A note? Oh, no, that's
a terrible mistake.
- Yes.

31:38.527 --> 31:40.653
Terrible.
People don't
appreciate them anyway.

31:40.653 --> 31:42.819
- I'm telling you the truth.
- You know, this is
some bullshit.

31:42.819 --> 31:44.444
The whole reason
I hit this car

31:44.444 --> 31:46.152
is because
you was up here--
yack, yack, yack--

31:46.152 --> 31:48.277
talking in my ear,
"Go through the yellow light.

31:48.277 --> 31:50.277
- Faster. Go. Go."
- I didn't do anything.

31:50.277 --> 31:51.985
- Hey, will you
sit down, please?
- Hey, you know what?

31:51.985 --> 31:53.944
You bus people are starting
to get on my nerves, okay?

31:53.944 --> 31:56.152
That's it.
Get the fuck off the bus!

31:56.152 --> 31:58.069
Hey, take-- wha-what--
hey, what are you doing?

31:58.069 --> 31:59.985
Larry:
No, you-- I--

31:59.985 --> 32:02.653
I have Asperger's!
I'm on the spectrum!

32:02.653 --> 32:04.319

- Get.

on my bus again,
