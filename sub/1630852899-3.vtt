00:09.139 --> 00:10.358
Previously, onFrom...

00:11.098 --> 00:12.360
Is Daddy coming home?

00:12.490 --> 00:13.970
Any second now.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.624
You go start saying
your prayers.

00:15.754 --> 00:17.539
I'll be there
in a minute.

00:17.669 --> 00:21.282
-Meagan, what are you doing?
-Maybe I can come in.

00:21.412 --> 00:23.284
-Meagan, no!

00:27.418 --> 00:29.246
You want a drink, huh?

00:29.377 --> 00:30.813
-Get the--
-No.

00:30.943 --> 00:32.336
A man protects
his family, Frank.

00:32.467 --> 00:33.816
Open your eyes
and look!

00:33.946 --> 00:36.297
Look at what you did.
Look at them.

00:36.427 --> 00:37.602
No!

00:37.733 --> 00:40.823
Tell my parents I said goodbye.

00:40.953 --> 00:43.391
Mom, Julie killed Norman.

00:43.521 --> 00:45.871
-What happened to Norman?
-The monsters killed them.

00:46.002 --> 00:48.048
There's no such thing
as monsters, honey.

00:48.178 --> 00:50.006
Why is there a tree
in the middle of the road?

00:50.137 --> 00:52.356
Must've gotten knocked down
in a storm or something.

00:52.487 --> 00:54.706
Oh, this can't be
the same place.

00:54.837 --> 00:57.448
Excuse me?

00:57.579 --> 01:00.669
We're trying to get back onto
the highway. Could you...

01:00.799 --> 01:03.324
-We're on the same fucking road.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.945
Dad, I think he's bleeding.
There's something in his leg.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.599
Are you a doctor?

01:17.729 --> 01:19.079
I was a third-year
medical student.

01:19.209 --> 01:22.517
Please stop.
It hurts. Ow!

01:22.647 --> 01:24.867
-We can make it to Colony House.

01:24.997 --> 01:26.695
Run as fast as you can,
no matter what you see.

01:26.825 --> 01:28.914
No matter what you hear,
you do not stop.

01:29.045 --> 01:31.830
-Hey, I need help here!

01:31.961 --> 01:34.398
Hey. Hey! Donna, let us in!

01:35.878 --> 01:37.662
You're from one
of those two cars?

01:37.793 --> 01:39.360
That hasn't happened
in a long, long time.

01:39.490 --> 01:42.058
What do you think it means?

01:42.189 --> 01:44.452
There are things you need to
know about where you are.

01:44.582 --> 01:47.281
This, unfortunately, is gonna be
the worst conversation

01:47.411 --> 01:48.325
of your life.

01:48.456 --> 01:49.892
Do you believe
in monsters?

01:50.022 --> 01:51.676
Why did you bring me here?

01:51.807 --> 01:54.157
'Cause I wanted you
to see that if you climb

01:54.288 --> 01:57.813
high enough, even a nightmare
can look like a dream.

01:57.943 --> 02:00.076
-This isn't your fault.
-What do you mean?

02:00.207 --> 02:02.513
I hear their voices.

02:02.644 --> 02:04.602
They said it was
the only way to go home.

02:04.733 --> 02:05.908
Sara, just tell me
what you did.

02:06.038 --> 02:08.128
I left the door open.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.521
-Those things. They walk.

02:10.652 --> 02:12.567
They never run.

02:12.697 --> 02:15.570
They know there's only
so many places we can go.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.876
I feel like I'm hanging on
by a thread here.

02:18.007 --> 02:22.707
I can't find any more bodies.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.622
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

02:55.305 --> 02:58.482
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Come on! Come on!

02:58.613 --> 03:00.180
Open the damn door!

03:11.974 --> 03:13.628
You have a bad dream?

03:13.758 --> 03:15.325
Yeah.

03:16.979 --> 03:18.850
Yeah. Yeah.

03:23.986 --> 03:26.771
Tobey!

03:26.902 --> 03:28.860
Somebody get me out of
this fucking thing. Hey!

03:28.991 --> 03:30.862
-Tobey, where are you?
-What's going on?

03:30.993 --> 03:32.212
Anybody fucking-- Hey.

03:32.342 --> 03:34.083
Shut the fuck up.
People are trying to sleep.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.999
-Who the fuck are you?
-Sorry.

03:37.129 --> 03:38.914
I'm usually more cordial
when I do this.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.875
You picked one hell of a time
to finally wake up.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.747
Listen. I don't know
what's going on here,

03:45.877 --> 03:47.836
alright, but you get me outta
these fucking straps

03:47.966 --> 03:49.403
right fucking now,
or I swear to God I'm--

03:49.533 --> 03:51.231
What?

03:53.102 --> 03:54.451
Do you have any idea
who I am?

03:54.582 --> 03:56.018
Oh, shit.
You're one of those.

03:56.148 --> 03:57.715
One of what?

03:57.846 --> 03:58.890
Okay.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.546
Let's start
at the beginning.

07:30.275 --> 07:32.016
You hungry, Frank?

07:32.147 --> 07:33.627
Anything you need?

07:38.719 --> 07:40.938
Look.

07:41.069 --> 07:43.027
It's important for you
to understand that

07:43.158 --> 07:47.031
what happens tonight...
it's not personal.

07:48.337 --> 07:50.121
I know.

07:53.124 --> 07:55.605
She liked you.

07:55.736 --> 07:58.129
Lauren.

07:58.260 --> 07:59.653
She always liked you.

08:02.307 --> 08:04.527
She said you were hard on people
'cause you had to be.

08:06.573 --> 08:09.271
That you made the decisions
other people couldn't.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.667
You're the one who was gonna
get everybody home.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.900
I wasn't always
like this, you know.

08:31.989 --> 08:34.557
None of us were.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.908
Look.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.737
If there's anything
you need,

08:40.868 --> 08:43.044
anyone
you wanna see, maybe,

08:43.174 --> 08:46.221
tie up loose ends...

08:46.351 --> 08:48.571
There is one thing
I'd like to do.

08:51.052 --> 08:53.358
So, you're telling me
that right now

08:53.489 --> 08:56.013
I'm in a town I can't leave,

08:56.144 --> 08:58.538
and that every night
when the sun goes down,

08:58.668 --> 09:02.846
monsters come from
the forest to hunt us?

09:02.977 --> 09:04.935
Monsters who, incidentally,

09:05.066 --> 09:06.197
killed my friend
the other night.

09:06.328 --> 09:07.808
Yeah.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.554
Yeah.

09:18.819 --> 09:20.211
Fuck off.

09:24.955 --> 09:28.306
This is... this is something.

09:28.437 --> 09:29.786
Where did he... where did he
find you?

09:29.917 --> 09:31.527
Who?

09:31.658 --> 09:33.224
Tobey.
Are you guys individual hires,

09:33.355 --> 09:35.270
or is this one of
those traveling companies?

09:35.400 --> 09:37.707
'Cause, I mean, you play
the whole thing pretty great.

09:37.838 --> 09:40.057
I buy it.

09:40.188 --> 09:41.406
Not him so much. I just...

09:41.537 --> 09:43.365
I thought you were trying
a little bit too hard.

09:43.495 --> 09:44.714
But otherwise, I...

09:46.934 --> 09:49.240
Bravo.
Oh. Money well spent.

09:49.371 --> 09:51.199
So, uh, okay.

09:51.329 --> 09:53.505
So, what's next?
Is there, uh...

09:53.636 --> 09:55.812
Is there, like, some kind of
puzzle I have to solve?

09:55.943 --> 09:57.379
Mmm.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.207
Actually, you know what?
Never mind.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.165
-Don't spoil it for me.
-Where are you going?

10:03.646 --> 10:04.995
Well, I'm not gonna
solve the puzzle

10:05.126 --> 10:06.344
sitting here all day.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.172
I'm gonna, you know,
check out the town,

10:08.303 --> 10:10.044
turn over a few stones.

10:10.174 --> 10:12.960
Fuck. Fuckin' Tobey.

10:13.090 --> 10:14.309
This must have cost a fortune.

10:17.268 --> 10:18.400
You want me to keep
an eye on him?

10:18.530 --> 10:20.532
No.

10:20.663 --> 10:22.534
Let him wander around town
for a while.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.319
We got enough
to deal with here.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.629
Ha.

10:33.023 --> 10:35.330
Okay.

10:35.460 --> 10:36.810
It's not quite
my Giacometti,

10:36.940 --> 10:39.247
but, uh, it'll do.

10:39.377 --> 10:40.988
Oh, perfect!

10:41.118 --> 10:43.120
Is that for me?

10:43.251 --> 10:44.774
Excuse me?

10:44.905 --> 10:47.995
Hey. Do you, uh... do you have
anything motorized,

10:48.125 --> 10:49.126
like a scooter or something?

10:49.257 --> 10:50.258
What? No.

10:50.388 --> 10:51.999
No? Okay.
This'll do. Thank you.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.392
I-- No, that's my--
Uh...

11:06.578 --> 11:09.538
Hey, buddy.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.235
Can I go outside today?

11:11.366 --> 11:13.411
Oh, honey.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.370
You need to stay in bed
a little longer.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.068
I'm tired
of staying in bed.

11:18.199 --> 11:21.506
And I don't like these pajamas.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.465
They're itchy
and they don't fit right.

11:23.595 --> 11:24.814
Oh, come on.

11:24.945 --> 11:26.207
Your dad went to the RV
to get our stuff.

11:26.337 --> 11:29.210
So tonight you're gonna sleep
in your own pajamas.

11:29.340 --> 11:30.777
We all should've gone.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.735
Well, we thought it was best
if Dad went on his own.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.650
Well, I don't like people
going through my stuff.

11:34.781 --> 11:35.999
Nobody's gonna do that.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.305
Yeah, okay.

11:37.435 --> 11:39.481
How long
are we gonna be here?

11:39.611 --> 11:42.832
We are, uh...
we're figuring that out.

11:44.312 --> 11:47.054
Hey. You hungry?

11:47.184 --> 11:48.533
I saw they're making eggs.
Do you want some eggs?

11:48.664 --> 11:51.145
Hobo eggs?

11:51.275 --> 11:52.407
No. No, no, no.
No hobo eggs.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.583
But they have oatmeal.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.628
Okay.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.674
What about you? You hungry?

11:58.805 --> 12:01.068
Uh, no. I think I'm just
gonna go for a walk.

12:01.198 --> 12:02.460
-Okay. Stay close.
-Yeah.

12:05.507 --> 12:08.553
I am going to get you
your oatmeal.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.251
Stay there.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.863
Oh, jeez.

13:33.073 --> 13:34.465
You okay?

13:38.600 --> 13:40.820
Here.
Let me get that.

14:07.759 --> 14:08.891
One...

14:11.763 --> 14:13.156
three...

14:13.287 --> 14:15.985
four, five.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.084
Berries?

14:28.215 --> 14:29.520
I'm okay.

14:32.654 --> 14:35.178
There's an apple tree out back
if you'd prefer that.

14:37.572 --> 14:40.183
I see you grow
your own food.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.403
Supermarkets around here
are terrible, so...

14:46.886 --> 14:48.539
Oh.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.585
You're joking.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.414
Ellis and your dad
are gonna be back soon.

14:53.544 --> 14:54.850
You'll feel a lot better

14:54.981 --> 14:56.634
once you have
some of your own things.

14:56.765 --> 14:58.375
Yeah, I guess.

15:00.247 --> 15:01.291
Hey.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.947
You doing okay?

15:07.297 --> 15:10.300
No. Not really.

15:10.431 --> 15:12.128
Come here.

15:24.488 --> 15:25.533
All right.

15:25.663 --> 15:28.362
Let's see
what we got here, bud.

15:28.492 --> 15:30.755
I heard you were getting
a little itchy, so...

15:30.886 --> 15:32.670
Thank you, Dad.

15:32.801 --> 15:34.281
You're welcome.

15:35.804 --> 15:38.807
Um, how did it go?

15:38.938 --> 15:42.767
It was, uh...
it was good.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.465
Yeah?

15:44.595 --> 15:46.380
Are my books in there?

15:46.510 --> 15:48.730
Oh.

15:48.860 --> 15:51.559
Books!
How did I forget books?

15:51.689 --> 15:52.777
Dad...

15:52.908 --> 15:54.866
Oh, let's see.
Maybe there's one.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.607
Maybe I can find something.

15:56.738 --> 15:59.784
Oh, wait a minute.
We have books.

15:59.915 --> 16:02.744
What do we want?

16:02.874 --> 16:06.400
Do we want Adventures of
the Grand Gooligog?

16:08.402 --> 16:09.620
Flight of the Cromenockle?

16:09.751 --> 16:11.666
-Ah. The Cromenockle.

16:11.796 --> 16:13.276
That's my favorite.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.017
Make the sound.

16:15.148 --> 16:19.456
Make the sound? I have no idea
what you're even...doo-ooh!

16:32.556 --> 16:35.255
She doesn't sound like that.

16:35.385 --> 16:37.735
No?
Does it sound like...

16:39.781 --> 16:42.871
No. Stop. Stop it.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.742
Okay, okay, okay.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.135
There's gonna be two
Cromenockles for you.

16:46.266 --> 16:47.615
Two.

16:54.535 --> 16:56.276
Two Cromenockles for the cave.

16:56.406 --> 16:58.626
-Two Cromenockles for you.

16:58.756 --> 17:00.889
Careful with your leg.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.197
Julie, look.
We got our stuff.

17:04.327 --> 17:05.720
Yeah. So I see.

17:05.850 --> 17:08.592
-Hey, come here.
-Julie!

17:08.723 --> 17:10.464
We're reading the Cromenockle.

17:10.594 --> 17:11.682
Julie!

17:15.208 --> 17:17.427
-Yeah. It's really funny.
-Hey.

17:17.558 --> 17:18.689
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.039
Father Khatri is here

17:20.169 --> 17:22.041
to talk to you about
the choosing ceremony.

17:22.171 --> 17:24.260
What's the
choosing ceremony?

17:24.391 --> 17:26.697
I'll let him fill you in.

17:26.828 --> 17:29.048
All newcomers have to decide
where they're gonna live.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.485
Here in Colony House
or down in the town.

17:31.615 --> 17:33.835
It's just part of
how we do things here.

17:33.965 --> 17:37.186
I'd like to take the both
of you, show you around.

17:37.317 --> 17:39.406
Maybe take you to the house
you'd be staying in,

17:39.536 --> 17:40.450
should you choose the town.

17:40.581 --> 17:42.713
Well, I wanna come.

17:42.844 --> 17:44.715
What?
This is about all of us, right?

17:44.846 --> 17:46.065
I wanna see.

17:46.195 --> 17:47.718
We need you to stay here
and be with Ethan.

17:47.849 --> 17:50.156
Donna can watch Ethan.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.637
Okay. Fine.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.685
You guys go ahead.

17:57.815 --> 17:58.903
Hey.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.732
We won't be gone long.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.256
Okay.

18:04.605 --> 18:05.910
You know what?

18:06.041 --> 18:08.130
Maybe I should stay.
I shouldn't leave her alone.

18:08.261 --> 18:10.785
I think it's very important
that both of you see this.

18:10.915 --> 18:12.482
It's gonna be okay.

18:12.613 --> 18:14.310
She's a tough kid.

18:14.441 --> 18:15.616
Takes after her mother.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.531
-Come.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.638
Good morning, everybody.

18:37.768 --> 18:40.423
What's cooking today, huh?

18:42.208 --> 18:43.644
Is this where I find
my next clue?

18:43.774 --> 18:45.124
Is this where the, uh...

18:45.254 --> 18:47.604
Is this where the monsters
jump from the shadows?

18:47.735 --> 18:51.086
Uh, "Oh, what wonders
will avail themselves

18:51.217 --> 18:54.002
in the quaint little
roadside diner

18:54.133 --> 18:57.571
in which my guard
hath fallen?"

18:58.702 --> 19:00.574
Huh?

19:00.704 --> 19:02.184
I did some summer stock
back in the day.

19:02.315 --> 19:04.404
Not bad, right?
Oh, thank you. I'm starving.

19:04.534 --> 19:06.754
-What've we got?
-Hey. There's a line.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.059
Look. I'm all
for authenticity,

19:08.190 --> 19:09.409
but I'm also
really hungry,

19:09.539 --> 19:11.454
and since y'all basically
work for me anyways,

19:11.585 --> 19:12.629
it's kind of okay.

19:12.760 --> 19:13.891
Ow. What the--

19:19.723 --> 19:21.203
All right. Jeez.

19:21.334 --> 19:23.249
People really
take all this seriously.

19:31.822 --> 19:34.869
What are you doing here?

19:34.999 --> 19:37.176
You promised
you'd stay home.

19:37.306 --> 19:39.526
If I didn't show up,
they would have wondered why.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.745
It'll be okay. I wanna help.

19:41.876 --> 19:44.661
-Sara--
-I need to help.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.100
You should get back to the barn.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.625
-It'll be okay.
-Sara...

19:51.755 --> 19:54.584
I promise.

20:03.376 --> 20:06.205
It's the talismans
that keep them out.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.685
Now, there are a number of
other precautions people take.

20:08.816 --> 20:10.687
Nailing the windows shut,
for instance.

20:10.818 --> 20:12.733
With a child in the house,
this is a must.

20:12.863 --> 20:14.343
Why?

20:14.474 --> 20:16.954
Well, there'll be nights
where these... these things,

20:17.085 --> 20:20.828
they'll try to convince you
to let them in.

20:20.958 --> 20:23.961
And children tend to be
most susceptible.

20:24.092 --> 20:28.139
How are people walking around
like all this is normal?

20:28.270 --> 20:29.880
Well, the people
who survive here

20:30.011 --> 20:32.231
are the ones who adapt.

20:32.361 --> 20:34.755
How exactly
do they do that?

20:34.885 --> 20:38.454
The way someone who lives
on a fault line, for example.

20:38.585 --> 20:39.629
They adapt to the notion

20:39.760 --> 20:40.674
that the earth
could just open up

20:40.804 --> 20:42.980
and swallow them
at any given moment.

20:43.111 --> 20:44.765
They go on with their lives

20:44.895 --> 20:48.334
because that reality is a part
of the world that they live in.

20:48.464 --> 20:50.901
Look. I wish there was
an explanation I could give you

20:51.032 --> 20:52.642
that would make
any of this easier.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.818
But it's gonna be fine.

20:54.949 --> 20:57.604
Okay? Just always remember.

20:57.734 --> 21:00.084
Place the talisman by the door.
Cover your windows.

21:00.215 --> 21:02.261
Nail your windows shut.

21:02.391 --> 21:05.655
You do these things, your
family's going to be just fine.

21:05.786 --> 21:07.875
Hey. Um, I'm sorry.
What's that?

21:13.707 --> 21:16.579
Um, we call that the box.

21:16.710 --> 21:20.366
It's our only form
of punishment we have here.

21:20.496 --> 21:24.892
You see, the rules we live by
are meant to protect each other,

21:25.022 --> 21:26.850
to keep each other safe.

21:26.981 --> 21:29.766
And when someone's
actions or negligence

21:29.897 --> 21:32.682
leads to the death
of a resident in town,

21:32.813 --> 21:36.860
the only punishment for that
crime is a night in the box.

21:39.036 --> 21:40.516
Jesus.

21:40.647 --> 21:43.040
But you keep one of those
talismans in there, right?

21:43.171 --> 21:44.477
No.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.655
How many times
have you used it?

21:50.831 --> 21:52.833
Tonight will be the first.

21:54.878 --> 21:56.880
Look. Come.

21:57.011 --> 21:59.187
-Your house is just up ahead.
-Yeah.

22:04.279 --> 22:06.890
So, it's not much,
but it'll keep you comfortable

22:07.021 --> 22:08.718
if you choose to live in town.

22:13.897 --> 22:15.464
Looks like somebody's
already living here.

22:20.295 --> 22:23.690
Um, there was a...

22:23.820 --> 22:27.737
There was an incident
the night before you arrived.

22:30.044 --> 22:31.915
The first we'd had in months.

22:33.308 --> 22:35.179
What kind of incident?

22:35.310 --> 22:37.834
The kind that happens
when people are careless.

22:58.899 --> 23:01.510
It was a child?

23:01.641 --> 23:03.207
Holy fuck.

23:03.338 --> 23:05.514
Meagan and her mother Lauren.

23:07.908 --> 23:10.650
The father was
passed out drunk

23:10.780 --> 23:12.434
at the other end of town
when it happened.

23:14.393 --> 23:18.135
This is what happens
when you break the rules.

23:28.972 --> 23:30.104
Tabitha, wait.

23:30.234 --> 23:31.279
No, Jim, I'm sorry.
I can't.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.063
I can't do that right now.

23:33.194 --> 23:34.674
You make it seem like
we have a choice.

23:34.804 --> 23:36.197
Jim.

23:36.327 --> 23:38.417
Jim, this is
fucking insane!

23:38.547 --> 23:41.332
That woman and her little girl
were ripped apart.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.770
Now they're putting the dad
in some fucking box at sundown

23:43.900 --> 23:44.858
for those things to--

23:44.988 --> 23:47.774
You heard
what the priest said.

23:47.904 --> 23:49.079
If he'd have followed
the rules,

23:49.210 --> 23:52.169
they'd all still be alive
right now.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.868
Jim? Why are you--
why are you so eager

23:54.998 --> 23:57.174
to take any of this
at face value, Jim?

24:00.874 --> 24:02.702
Because I can still hear
those things whispering

24:02.832 --> 24:04.094
outside the RV.

24:04.225 --> 24:07.271
I can still hear them
tapping on the glass.

24:07.402 --> 24:11.362
Tabby, whatever this is,
it's real, and we are stuck.

24:11.493 --> 24:13.756
So we better figure out a way
to make the best of it.

24:15.584 --> 24:17.978
'Cause we don't want to
end up like...

24:20.241 --> 24:21.982
No, no, no. No.

24:30.033 --> 24:31.948
This was Meagan's
favorite spot.

24:38.346 --> 24:39.913
Put this swing here for her,

24:40.043 --> 24:42.916
and she was
always wanting me

24:43.046 --> 24:46.789
to push her higher and higher,

24:46.920 --> 24:49.009
but Lauren was afraid
it wasn't safe.

24:55.406 --> 24:58.279
You'll bury me next to them,
right?

24:58.409 --> 24:59.933
Yeah.

25:01.761 --> 25:02.892
Of course.

25:06.069 --> 25:08.071
Okay.

25:08.202 --> 25:09.856
I'll just be a few minutes here.

25:09.986 --> 25:11.988
Okay.
Take whatever time you need.

25:36.317 --> 25:38.232
All right, little guy.

25:38.362 --> 25:39.929
Give that a try
and let me know how it feels.

25:45.805 --> 25:47.067
Feel good?

25:47.197 --> 25:49.330
It hurts my armpit.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.550
Oh, it hurts your armpit?
Okay. Hold on.

25:51.680 --> 25:55.336
Here. I'll add a little
extra padding there for you,

25:55.466 --> 25:58.034
and if this feels good,
I'll tie it on later, okay?

25:58.165 --> 25:59.209
Here. Try that.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.430
Ready? Here.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.127
Let's go
down the stairs here.

26:04.258 --> 26:05.781
Take your time.
There you go, buddy.

26:05.912 --> 26:08.697
Come on. Three, two, one.

26:09.959 --> 26:10.786
Boom!

26:12.048 --> 26:13.136
He's adorable.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.400
Why are you doing this?

26:16.531 --> 26:17.924
What do you mean?

26:18.054 --> 26:19.708
You guys barely know us.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.147
It's just what we do.

26:31.502 --> 26:33.679
It's, like,
the ultimate escape room.

26:33.809 --> 26:36.290
I mean, seriously, I don't know
how he pulled all this together.

26:36.420 --> 26:38.945
So, um, I'm thinking

26:39.075 --> 26:41.861
maybe there's a clue
in each one of the buildings?

26:41.991 --> 26:44.037
Hmm?
Am I getting warmer?

26:44.167 --> 26:46.387
'Cause I mean, usually,
you know,

26:46.517 --> 26:48.258
you have some type of prompt
that lets you know

26:48.389 --> 26:50.260
which direction to go.
But this is, uh...

26:50.391 --> 26:52.175
This is just
some next-level shit.

26:54.134 --> 26:56.049
Has, uh...

26:56.179 --> 27:00.270
Has anyone
talked to you yet?

27:00.401 --> 27:04.144
Yeah. The lady up at the, uh,
big house. Donna.

27:04.274 --> 27:06.015
I mean, she gave me
the whole intro.

27:06.146 --> 27:07.713
You know,
the monsters in the forest.

27:07.843 --> 27:10.672
Tobey's dead. Blah, blah, blah.
But she didn't give me any hints

27:10.803 --> 27:12.239
about where I'm supposed to go
next. Here's the thing, though.

27:12.369 --> 27:14.894
Like, as thorough
as all this feels,

27:15.024 --> 27:17.244
there's a couple flaws
in the logic.

27:17.374 --> 27:19.899
I'm sitting here eating eggs
in a diner

27:20.029 --> 27:22.075
in a place that's
supposed to be, what,

27:22.205 --> 27:23.903
some kind of
mystical nightmare?

27:24.033 --> 27:25.513
I mean,
I don't know about you,

27:25.644 --> 27:28.342
but my nightmares
don't usually serve breakfast.

27:28.472 --> 27:30.300
I suppose you're gonna tell me
you've got chickens

27:30.431 --> 27:31.954
roaming around
in the big bad forest?

27:32.085 --> 27:33.260
Yeah, but the chickens,
the cows?

27:33.390 --> 27:35.436
We don't really know
where they come from.

27:35.566 --> 27:37.046
Mmm.

27:38.395 --> 27:40.354
That's actually not bad
for a nightmare breakfast.

27:43.618 --> 27:45.881
I should probably get going.

27:49.537 --> 27:51.321
Am I supposed to get anything
from you?

27:52.496 --> 27:54.237
What?

27:54.368 --> 27:56.457
I don't know. Like a clue

27:56.587 --> 28:01.288
or some kind of
cryptic direction?

28:01.418 --> 28:04.334
You know what? Never mind.
I'll figure it out.

28:06.554 --> 28:09.339
Thanks.

28:17.478 --> 28:20.394
-Was that--
-The guy from the other car.

28:20.524 --> 28:23.484
He's gonna get himself killed.

28:23.614 --> 28:26.182
Um, are you hungry?
Have you eaten anything yet?

28:26.313 --> 28:28.315
No, I'm fine. I just came
to check on you guys.

28:28.445 --> 28:29.446
Right.

28:33.973 --> 28:36.062
Okay.

28:36.192 --> 28:38.151
How's she doing?

28:38.281 --> 28:40.544
Well, she's...

28:40.675 --> 28:43.199
Uh, like I said, denial is a
major part of our family tree.

28:53.470 --> 28:55.342
Let's see, now.

28:55.472 --> 28:56.517
Twelve.

28:56.647 --> 28:59.215
Ten, 12.

29:00.390 --> 29:01.435
Okay.

29:15.536 --> 29:17.843
What are you doing?

29:19.148 --> 29:21.194
I don't think you're supposed
to be out here.

29:21.324 --> 29:22.543
Are you looking
for something?

29:22.673 --> 29:24.066
Go away.

29:24.197 --> 29:27.940
I can help you look.
I'm good at finding stuff.

29:28.070 --> 29:30.377
I'm not looking.

29:30.507 --> 29:32.553
I'm checking.

29:32.683 --> 29:34.773
What are you checking?

29:38.341 --> 29:40.039
You ask a lot of questions.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.477
That was only three.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.265
-I can help you check.
-No.

29:49.396 --> 29:50.658
No, you're trouble.

29:50.789 --> 29:51.920
Your mom or pop comes back

29:52.051 --> 29:54.401
and they see you out here,
who gets blamed?

29:54.531 --> 29:57.360
And Donna cuts me off.
Then no more peaches.

29:58.405 --> 30:02.017
-What are you talking about?
-Just go away.

30:05.368 --> 30:07.109
Have you seen the boy
who lives out here?

30:10.721 --> 30:12.114
What?

30:12.245 --> 30:13.289
Forget it.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.683
No, no. Hold on.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.817
What do you mean
"lives out here"?

30:18.947 --> 30:21.471
He's always walking around
out here,

30:21.602 --> 30:24.126
and I never see him inside.

30:24.257 --> 30:25.475
So I figured he lived
out here somewhere.

30:25.606 --> 30:28.435
Is that right?

30:28.565 --> 30:29.958
We're friends.

30:33.396 --> 30:35.572
Are you, now?

30:35.703 --> 30:39.228
Well, it's good to have friends.

30:39.359 --> 30:41.013
Okay.

30:41.143 --> 30:43.885
Wait. Hey, come here.

30:50.761 --> 30:53.025
I'm checking to see
if they've moved.

30:53.155 --> 30:54.983
If what moved?

30:55.114 --> 30:56.332
The trees.

30:56.463 --> 30:58.378
-Really?
-Yeah.

30:58.508 --> 31:00.467
Did they?

31:00.597 --> 31:02.991
Don't know yet.
I'm not done checking.

31:04.297 --> 31:05.515
Ethan?

31:05.646 --> 31:08.431
Ethan,
what the fuck?

31:08.562 --> 31:10.172
Get back inside.
Mom told me to watch you.

31:12.174 --> 31:13.567
Guess I gotta go.

31:13.697 --> 31:15.134
Yeah.
I guess you'd better, then.

31:15.264 --> 31:17.092
Will you let me know
about the trees?

31:17.223 --> 31:18.311
I'll keep you looped.

31:18.441 --> 31:20.052
Ethan, now.

31:20.182 --> 31:21.618
Hey.

31:21.749 --> 31:23.403
If you see that friend of yours,

31:23.533 --> 31:26.536
tell him Victor says hello.

31:34.370 --> 31:36.111
Don't talk to him.

31:36.242 --> 31:37.373
Why?

31:37.504 --> 31:38.809
Because he's creepy.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.115
-No, he's not.
-Come on.

31:40.246 --> 31:42.335
He's checking to see
if the trees moved.

31:42.465 --> 31:44.990
Yeah, and
that's totally normal.

31:50.386 --> 31:53.389
One, two.

32:06.272 --> 32:09.797
Yahtzee.
All right, Tobey.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.668
Let's see what you got.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.728
Holy shit.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.367
What the fuck?

33:15.689 --> 33:19.519
Tobey, you're a fucking genius!

33:31.400 --> 33:34.099
Ah. Woo!

33:52.900 --> 33:55.772
That's a sight
I don't see very often.

33:55.903 --> 33:58.688
Yeah, well...

33:58.819 --> 34:01.430
Don't get used to it.

34:01.561 --> 34:03.693
He's not answering.

34:05.826 --> 34:08.350
Well, perhaps you're
not listening closely enough.

34:14.530 --> 34:16.837
I can't do it.

34:19.405 --> 34:20.667
Frank. The box.

34:23.670 --> 34:25.193
Can't do it.

34:27.021 --> 34:29.719
It was never supposed...

34:29.850 --> 34:32.461
I built the goddamn box
as a deterrent.

34:32.592 --> 34:34.376
It's supposed
to scare people.

34:34.507 --> 34:38.424
I... can't.

34:40.774 --> 34:42.297
All right.

34:44.691 --> 34:47.085
Let's say you don't.

34:47.215 --> 34:50.523
Let's say you absolve Frank
of all his crimes.

34:50.653 --> 34:52.438
Then what?

34:54.440 --> 34:56.659
What happens next time?

34:56.790 --> 35:00.533
I mean, you warned him
on several occasions.

35:00.663 --> 35:03.840
Very publicly,
I might add.

35:03.971 --> 35:05.625
How do you think people
are gonna react

35:05.755 --> 35:08.715
when you let Frank go?

35:08.845 --> 35:10.586
How much weight
do you think the rules

35:10.717 --> 35:14.721
that hold this town together
will carry?

35:14.851 --> 35:16.897
Aren't you supposed to be
talking to me

35:17.027 --> 35:18.594
about the virtues of mercy?

35:21.684 --> 35:24.339
I see.

35:24.470 --> 35:26.298
Is that
what you'd prefer?

35:26.428 --> 35:30.519
Hey. I'd prefer not to put
a broken man in a fucking box

35:30.650 --> 35:32.913
to be torn apart
when the sun goes down!

35:33.043 --> 35:35.959
That's what I'd prefer.

35:36.090 --> 35:38.527
I'm not gonna stand here
and pretend like

35:38.658 --> 35:40.399
this is an easy decision.

35:40.529 --> 35:42.183
Great.

35:42.314 --> 35:44.446
But you built a guillotine
in the town square.

35:46.274 --> 35:48.407
What do you think happens
when people realize

35:48.537 --> 35:50.452
you lack the conviction
to use it?

35:53.194 --> 35:55.457
You're a terrible
fucking priest.

35:55.588 --> 35:56.545
You know that?

36:01.463 --> 36:03.552
Fucking worst.

36:03.683 --> 36:04.988
Now I'm cursing
in the house of the Lord.

36:05.119 --> 36:06.860
What the fuck is this?

37:01.480 --> 37:02.829
Goddamn it!

37:12.665 --> 37:14.536
There's a little shack

37:14.667 --> 37:17.235
about a hundred yards
beyond the tree line.

37:17.365 --> 37:20.542
You take that,
you put it next to the door,

37:20.673 --> 37:22.892
and you make whatever life
you can out there.

37:36.645 --> 37:38.821
What are you gonna tell
everybody?

37:48.004 --> 37:50.964
Thank you all for coming.

37:51.094 --> 37:54.097
Today, our newcomers will choose
where they would like

37:54.228 --> 37:55.882
to spend their days here
with us.

37:56.012 --> 37:57.753
Should you choose
to spend your time

37:57.884 --> 37:59.929
with the people of the town

38:00.060 --> 38:04.194
to live by our rules for
the good of the community

38:04.325 --> 38:06.240
until we find our way
back home,

38:06.371 --> 38:08.808
you will select the rock.

38:08.938 --> 38:11.114
Should you choose to join
with the people of Colony House

38:11.245 --> 38:15.858
to live for today because
tomorrow is not guaranteed,

38:15.989 --> 38:18.383
you will select the flower.

38:18.513 --> 38:22.256
Now, once you have chosen,
this choice will be final.

38:22.387 --> 38:25.215
-Like many of us here--
-Father Khatri?

38:25.346 --> 38:27.827
Uh, sorry.
Do you mind if I, uh--

38:27.957 --> 38:29.872
Uh, yeah. Sure.

38:32.310 --> 38:35.704
Since we're all
gathered here,

38:35.835 --> 38:38.838
figure I might as well address
the elephant in the room.

38:38.968 --> 38:44.104
Been a lot of questions today
about Frank, the box,

38:44.234 --> 38:47.150
the rules.

38:47.281 --> 38:50.719
There is a fine line

38:50.850 --> 38:54.854
between savagery
and consequence.

38:54.984 --> 38:57.335
And if we're not willing...

39:01.077 --> 39:02.775
Frank?

39:05.343 --> 39:07.867
I'd like to say a few things,
if that's all right.

39:19.487 --> 39:22.969
You know what I've been thinking
about these last couple of days,

39:23.099 --> 39:25.841
sitting in my cell?

39:25.972 --> 39:27.495
Christmas.

39:29.889 --> 39:33.371
The last one me and Lauren
and Meagan had before we...

39:38.201 --> 39:40.116
I was a good dad, you know?

39:41.901 --> 39:43.685
I mean, I wasn't perfect,

39:43.816 --> 39:47.472
but I wasn't like this.

39:48.908 --> 39:52.520
That last Christmas, we got
Meagan her first dollhouse.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.395
And when she saw it,
the look on her face...

40:03.183 --> 40:04.924
I let this town,

40:05.054 --> 40:08.971
those things in the woods,

40:09.102 --> 40:12.671
I let them get
to my head, and...

40:12.801 --> 40:14.803
I forgot what really mattered.

40:14.934 --> 40:19.199
I... forgot that
if I'd just been

40:19.329 --> 40:21.070
a little stronger...

40:24.857 --> 40:26.685
there might have still been
a Christmas morning

40:26.815 --> 40:29.470
waiting for us all
when we got home.

40:32.908 --> 40:35.041
Don't let this place
take that away from you.

40:37.043 --> 40:39.132
Okay?

40:39.262 --> 40:42.875
You look after each other.
You take care of each other.

40:44.964 --> 40:46.922
Remember what
you're living for.

40:49.664 --> 40:52.058
I appreciate everything you're
trying to do for me, Sheriff.

40:52.188 --> 40:55.888
No, I do. I really do.

40:57.280 --> 41:00.588
But the only two things that I
love in this world are gone.

41:03.330 --> 41:05.550
And I just wanna see
my girls again.

41:09.075 --> 41:12.208
Wait! No! Don't go, Frank.

41:16.082 --> 41:18.388
Goddamn, I love this!
It's scary.

41:18.519 --> 41:21.348
It's, uh, dramatic. It's...

41:21.479 --> 41:23.872
Okay. Whoa, big fella. Okay.

41:24.003 --> 41:25.918
All right, okay.
Easy, easy.

41:26.048 --> 41:27.223
Easy.

41:27.354 --> 41:28.790
Pick one.

41:28.921 --> 41:30.923
You need to fucking let me go.
Ow! What the fuck?

41:31.053 --> 41:32.577
Pick one!

41:32.707 --> 41:35.405
I'm gonna fucking sue you.
Ow! Okay. All right. Okay.

41:35.536 --> 41:37.103
-All right. All right?
-Got it.

41:37.233 --> 41:38.800
Let's go.

41:38.931 --> 41:41.542
Ow. Damn it! Ow! Damn! Ah!

41:44.066 --> 41:46.112
Oh, you have no idea how badly
you just fucked up, okay?

41:46.242 --> 41:47.505
All right? No idea.

41:47.635 --> 41:50.508
I am gonna...
I'm gonna fucking ruin you.

41:50.638 --> 41:52.422
All right, I'm gonna fucking
ruin all of you!

41:52.553 --> 41:55.251
Jade, let me show
you something.

41:57.210 --> 41:58.864
Come on.

42:02.911 --> 42:05.087
Frank, you don't
have to do this.

42:05.218 --> 42:06.393
You shouldn't be making
decisions like this

42:06.524 --> 42:07.481
when you're hurting.

42:07.612 --> 42:09.396
No. Look.
I'm the most clear-minded

42:09.527 --> 42:11.833
I've been in a long time.
Trust me.

42:11.964 --> 42:13.008
All right.

42:13.139 --> 42:14.923
Let's get this done.

42:17.926 --> 42:19.188
Are you living in town
or Colony House?

42:19.319 --> 42:21.234
Town.

42:21.364 --> 42:23.192
Sorry.

42:23.323 --> 42:25.064
You each have to say it.

42:25.194 --> 42:26.805
Oh, yeah. Town.

42:26.935 --> 42:29.155
Ethan.

42:29.285 --> 42:30.678
Town.

42:30.809 --> 42:32.854
Okay.

42:32.985 --> 42:34.116
Julie.

42:34.247 --> 42:36.336
Colony House.

42:36.466 --> 42:39.905
-What? No, no.
-No. She doesn't mean that.

42:40.035 --> 42:41.167
Girl made her choice.

42:41.297 --> 42:43.169
-Hold on a second.
-It's done.

42:43.299 --> 42:44.866
-Ceremony is over.
-No, no, I'm sorry.

42:44.997 --> 42:46.738
She can't make that decision.
She's underage.

42:46.868 --> 42:48.609
-No.
-Mom, it's fine.

42:48.740 --> 42:51.177
No, it's not fine.
Come and stay with your family.

42:51.307 --> 42:52.700
You don't have
to do that, Julie.

42:52.831 --> 42:54.702
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to my daughter.

42:54.833 --> 42:56.791
Now, there's no way
anyone's gonna expect us to--

42:56.922 --> 42:58.314
Are you gonna say something?

42:58.445 --> 43:00.142
Okay. Everybody
just hold on, okay?

43:00.273 --> 43:01.927
Take a breath.

43:02.057 --> 43:04.973
Ju-- Julie, Julie.

43:05.104 --> 43:07.193
Do you want to live
in Colony House?

43:10.588 --> 43:12.502
Yeah.

43:12.633 --> 43:14.896
-Why are you doing this?

43:15.027 --> 43:18.421
She chose.
Your rules, Boyd, not mine.

43:18.552 --> 43:19.814
No, you know what?
It's okay.

43:19.945 --> 43:21.468
I change my mind. I go.
I choose Colony House.

43:21.599 --> 43:22.774
-Tabitha, just--
-What?

43:22.904 --> 43:24.297
I'm not standing here,
knowing that my daughter

43:24.427 --> 43:27.343
-is in that fucking house.
-Everything is gonna be okay.

43:27.474 --> 43:28.606
-No, it's not! Fucking no.
-Okay, look.

43:28.736 --> 43:29.694
-We're gonna fix this.
-There is nothing to fix.

43:29.824 --> 43:32.697
Will you shut the fuck up?

43:35.700 --> 43:40.443
Please, please,
don't do this now, right here.

43:40.574 --> 43:43.185
My son will be up there.

43:43.316 --> 43:45.753
I promise you
she will be looked after.

43:49.235 --> 43:50.453
All right.

43:50.584 --> 43:54.893
Uh, everybody,
the sun will be going down soon.

43:55.023 --> 43:57.112
So, uh, thank you for coming.

43:57.243 --> 43:58.940
It's okay.
I'll take care of him.

44:10.125 --> 44:12.301
I'm done.

44:12.432 --> 44:14.347
All right. Your boy,
the sheriff, crossed the line,

44:14.477 --> 44:16.871
so just call me a car
or whatever,

44:17.002 --> 44:20.222
'cause I'm fucking done.
Fuck.

44:20.353 --> 44:23.661
I need you
to understand something.

44:23.791 --> 44:26.664
No one is trying
to be cruel to you.

44:26.794 --> 44:28.796
But you need to understand
what's going on.

44:28.927 --> 44:31.103
Are you listening?
Did you hear what I just said?

44:31.233 --> 44:33.279
I'm not interested.
Okay? This whole thing

44:33.409 --> 44:35.716
lost its interest for me

44:35.847 --> 44:37.805
the second that asshole
put his hands on me, and...

44:50.688 --> 44:53.473
Okay, you know what?
This isn't funny anymore.

44:53.603 --> 44:55.170
This, uh...

44:58.260 --> 44:59.653
You hear me, guys?

44:59.784 --> 45:04.005
It's not funny anymore!

45:04.136 --> 45:05.441
This, uh...

45:16.191 --> 45:17.497
Oh, God.

45:20.282 --> 45:21.327
I... Oh, God.

45:23.633 --> 45:25.418
Oh, God, Jesus.

45:28.073 --> 45:29.030
Tobey?

45:40.389 --> 45:41.739
All right, come on.

45:43.262 --> 45:45.264
There he is.

46:38.665 --> 46:41.189
You get
these people home, Sheriff.

46:41.320 --> 46:43.452
I'll do everything I can.

46:43.583 --> 46:46.107
Promise me?

46:46.238 --> 46:48.066
Yeah, Frank.

46:48.196 --> 46:49.502
I promise.

47:05.735 --> 47:07.302
I'm ready.

47:27.757 --> 47:29.150
Okay.

48:34.650 --> 48:35.782
Careful. In you go.

48:40.743 --> 48:43.181
There's one outside.

48:48.273 --> 48:49.927
Let's get you settled in.

49:45.504 --> 49:49.290
This is, uh...
this is Jade.

49:58.517 --> 49:59.866
Uh, let's get you set up.

50:11.573 --> 50:14.620
Are you and Daddy
gonna sleep in here?

50:14.750 --> 50:16.883
Yeah, yeah.

50:17.014 --> 50:19.799
We're all going to be together.

50:19.929 --> 50:22.845
Is Julie
ever coming back?

50:22.976 --> 50:25.544
Honey,
she's right up the hill.

50:25.674 --> 50:27.676
You can see her
anytime you want.

50:27.807 --> 50:29.548
-Okay.
-Okay?

50:32.464 --> 50:33.856
Shall we have a read?

50:33.987 --> 50:35.684
Yeah!

50:43.562 --> 50:44.998
All right.

50:45.129 --> 50:47.435
Last I remember,
it was chapter three.

50:47.566 --> 50:49.307
Start from the beginning.

50:51.526 --> 50:53.833
Yeah.
It has been a while.

50:55.574 --> 50:59.404
Well, it all began
one sunny morning,

50:59.534 --> 51:02.711
as a cat lay
comfortably basking in the sun,

51:02.842 --> 51:04.409
in a beautiful green shire.

51:04.539 --> 51:06.672
As we always do,

51:06.802 --> 51:09.501
let's welcome
our newest family member.

51:09.631 --> 51:10.937
Here's to Julie.

51:11.068 --> 51:12.721
To Julie!

51:15.985 --> 51:17.335
Thank you.

51:17.465 --> 51:19.293
Welcome, kiddo.

51:19.424 --> 51:21.469
Oh, we're glad to have you.
