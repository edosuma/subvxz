KELLY: Well, I hope you like
our little send-off.

00:22.357 --> 00:23.691
Yeah, we're gonna
miss you, Commander.

00:23.724 --> 00:24.959
I'm gonna miss you guys.

00:24.992 --> 00:26.193
Believe me,
I wouldn't be leaving

00:26.227 --> 00:27.995
if it wasn't such a sweet offer.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.297
Yeah, I guess it's not every day

00:29.330 --> 00:30.831
you get to help design
a space station.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.533
-Are you nervous?
-A little.

00:32.567 --> 00:35.536
But, hey, as long as I can
sneak a pop or two on the job.

00:35.570 --> 00:36.871
Glug, glug, glug.

00:36.904 --> 00:39.840
Nah. Can you imagine?

00:39.874 --> 00:41.242
Ah...

00:42.677 --> 00:45.045
-Think he knows yet?
-No. Look at him.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.381
He has no idea.

00:46.414 --> 00:47.382
JOHN:
How the hell can he not know?

00:47.415 --> 00:49.517
What are you guys talking about?

00:49.550 --> 00:51.719
We took a piece of Yaphit
when he wasn't looking,

00:51.752 --> 00:53.020
and we dropped it in the buffet.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.222
(gasps)
Oh, my God, no, you didn't!

00:55.256 --> 00:57.157
JOHN: Yeah, we're just waiting
for him to catch on.

00:57.191 --> 01:00.895
(laughs)
You guys are so hilarious.

01:00.928 --> 01:04.231
Ah, I wish I had the guts
to pull pranks.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.401
I always think of
super outrageous stuff,

01:06.434 --> 01:08.102
and I never follow through.

01:08.135 --> 01:10.905
(chuckles) You guys should
get to know me better

01:10.938 --> 01:13.408
'cause I'm really funny.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.242
Oh, check it out, he's leaving.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.748
Oh, I love jokes.

01:22.450 --> 01:23.751
Hey, Doc.

01:23.784 --> 01:24.952
(quietly):
Oh, God, the last person

01:24.985 --> 01:27.221
I want to see right now.
Yaphit,

01:27.254 --> 01:30.891
I'm very busy-- this better not
be a social visit.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.560
No, it's not.
I don't feel well.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.561
What's wrong?

01:33.594 --> 01:35.129
I think I lost a piece.

01:35.162 --> 01:36.431
Uh, excuse me?

01:36.464 --> 01:38.232
I feel like
I'm missing a piece,

01:38.265 --> 01:40.401
and I can't for the life of me
figure out where I lost it.

01:40.435 --> 01:43.638
Well, okay, hop up on the table,
let's have a look.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.043
(scanner trilling)

01:49.076 --> 01:51.412
I'm not quite sure
how to ask this,

01:51.446 --> 01:54.549
but when your species loses
a piece of tissue,

01:54.582 --> 01:56.384
is it conscious?

01:56.417 --> 01:58.719
Kind of.
I have a dim sense

01:58.753 --> 02:00.755
of a dark, wet place.

02:00.788 --> 02:03.791
I-I just can't get
any more specific than that.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.793
Bortus, what can I do for you?

02:05.826 --> 02:08.796
I am experiencing
digestive discomfort.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.965
With your iron stomach?
Okay.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.800
Have a seat.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.139
Um, Yaphit?

02:19.173 --> 02:21.409
-Yeah?
-I think I found your piece.

02:21.442 --> 02:22.643
Wh-What do you mean?

02:22.677 --> 02:25.446
-Inside Bortus' digestive tract.
-What?!

02:25.480 --> 02:27.948
What the hell, man,
you friggin' ate me?

02:27.982 --> 02:29.049
I did not eat you.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.184
Well, what the hell am I

02:30.217 --> 02:32.119
doing inside you, you bastard?

02:32.152 --> 02:34.589
Bortus, have you eaten anything
in the past hour?

02:34.622 --> 02:37.925
Only a slice of prawgus cake
at the buffet.

02:37.958 --> 02:40.127
Yaphit, did you go near
the prawgus cake at all?

02:40.160 --> 02:42.530
Oh, crap. Yeah.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.799
With John and Gordon,
those dicks.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.734
Mystery solved.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.102
Aw, man, I don't believe it.

02:48.135 --> 02:50.605
Ah, okay, how you want
to do this?

02:50.638 --> 02:51.839
Do what?

02:51.872 --> 02:53.508
I gotta go in and get the piece.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.175
What do you mean, "go in"?

02:55.209 --> 02:56.944
I mean go in.
I gotta go in.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.278
Pick an entry.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.314
I will not allow you inside me.

03:00.347 --> 03:01.616
Doc, help me out here.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.183
Bortus, I'm sorry.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.052
He can do it cleaner than I can.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.555
(sighs)
Do what you must.

03:07.588 --> 03:08.656

All right, come on.

Aw, dude,
it stinks down here.

03:19.734 --> 03:21.168
What the hell
you been eating?

03:21.201 --> 03:24.204
What is that, a--
is that a boot?!

03:24.238 --> 03:25.573
Ah, there we go.
Jackpot.

03:26.941 --> 03:28.609
CLAIRE:
Great. Now, if you two

03:28.643 --> 03:31.111
wouldn't mind leaving,
this is more weirdness

03:31.145 --> 03:33.147
than I can handle in one day.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.921
At any point, did you consider
the possibility

03:40.955 --> 03:42.389
that what you were doing
was stupid?

03:42.423 --> 03:44.559
BOTH (slowly):
No. No.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.026
-I didn't, no.
-Not that I remember.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.362
Did it occur to you that
Yaphit might be upset?

03:48.395 --> 03:49.396
-Yes.
-No.

03:50.565 --> 03:54.234
At the time, it did not seem

03:54.268 --> 03:55.870
a matter of consequence.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.405
Honestly, we just thought
it would be funny.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.508
Well, I hope you got
a good laugh,

04:00.541 --> 04:02.710
because if I can't talk him
out of filing charges,

04:02.743 --> 04:05.045
-you guys are gonna be
in trouble. -Yes, sir.

04:05.079 --> 04:07.682
I'm placing a formal reprimand
on each of your records.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.383
Dismissed.

05:38.673 --> 05:40.274
Come in.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.078
Hey.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.013
Take a look at this.

05:47.782 --> 05:50.150
-Is this accurate?
-I confirmed it

05:50.184 --> 05:51.986
with the Union Central
database just to be sure.

05:52.019 --> 05:55.522
Ed, that aptitude rating
is through the roof.

05:55.556 --> 05:59.293
Aside from Isaac, John is
the smartest officer on board.

05:59.326 --> 06:01.361
My God, he sure doesn't
act like it.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.030
I heard about the Yaphit thing.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.566
Yeah, I spoke to Yaphit
and calmed him down.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.568
How did we not know about this?

06:07.602 --> 06:10.437
I'm gonna talk to John
and try to get the full story.

06:10.470 --> 06:13.040
But, Ed, I have
a suggestion for you.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.041
With Newton leaving,

06:14.074 --> 06:15.810
what about John?

06:15.843 --> 06:17.712
-For what?
-Chief engineer.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.280
(gags, coughs)

06:20.314 --> 06:23.450
-You okay?
-Yeah. Um...

06:23.483 --> 06:25.753
wow, that's...
that's a hard sell.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.222
Why?
Look at the numbers.

06:28.255 --> 06:30.157
Advanced engineering test scores
at Union Point

06:30.190 --> 06:31.258
were off the charts.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.893
Look, he's obviously brilliant,

06:32.927 --> 06:34.729
I'll give you that,
but heading up a division is

06:34.762 --> 06:36.731
about more than just smarts.

06:36.764 --> 06:39.634
He's never shown any indication
of leadership ability.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.368
He'd have to oversee
a lot of personnel.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.871
He's never had the chance.
He could surprise us.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.240
Kelly, he fed a guy
to another guy.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.808
That's not something
a department head does.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.409
Come on, you know those two.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.879
Odds are Gordon was the brain
trust behind that stunt.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.213
Oh, and John just
went along with it?

06:53.247 --> 06:54.448
That only proves my point.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.550
Look, all I'm saying is that

06:56.583 --> 06:58.552
maybe somewhere
he's got it in him.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.588
(thunderous crash, rumbling)

07:14.869 --> 07:16.436
ED:
Report.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.305
We've dropped out
of quantum drive, Captain.

07:18.338 --> 07:20.040
-What the hell just happened?
-I have no idea.

07:20.074 --> 07:21.909
Maybe we hit a squirrel
or something.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.712
There is no evidence
of any Sciuromorpha Rodentia

07:24.745 --> 07:26.313
or other midsized rodent.

07:26.346 --> 07:29.249
Captain, we appear
to have skimmed the outer edge

07:29.283 --> 07:31.418
of a spatial anomaly
of some variety.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.419
Damage report?

07:32.452 --> 07:33.453
All departments reporting.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.089
No injuries or hull damage.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.623
However,
the lower quantum engine

07:36.657 --> 07:37.925
has been knocked
out of alignment.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.393
Oh, great.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.161
It looks like we're stuck here
for a few hours.

07:41.195 --> 07:43.597
Does the anomaly pose
any danger to the ship?

07:43.630 --> 07:46.166
At our current coordinates,
I do not believe so.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.235
It's just a big old
nasty pothole.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.671
Well, we'd better map it so
no one else gets banged around.

07:50.705 --> 07:52.406
Isaac, get the engine
realignment started,

07:52.439 --> 07:54.441
and then run a full-range scan
of the anomaly.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.076
Coordinate with Yaphit
in engineering.

07:56.110 --> 07:57.411
I believe an internal scan

07:57.444 --> 07:59.546
of the affected areas
of the ship

07:59.579 --> 08:00.981
-would also be prudent.
-Do it.

08:02.516 --> 08:03.984
Captain, with your permission,

08:04.018 --> 08:06.486
perhaps Lieutenant Lamarr
could be of help.

08:06.520 --> 08:07.922
I'm-I'm sorry, what?

08:10.725 --> 08:14.594
Lieutenant, please assist Isaac
with his analysis.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.764
Aye, Commander.

08:25.539 --> 08:26.506
TY:
Isaac!

08:26.540 --> 08:28.342
ISAAC:
Hello, Ty.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.376
Hello, Marcus.

08:29.409 --> 08:30.410
We got out of school early

08:30.444 --> 08:31.511
because of the bumps.

08:31.545 --> 08:32.847
You want to go to the simulator

08:32.880 --> 08:34.348
and play some Space Dragons?

08:34.381 --> 08:36.083
I am currently occupied.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.217
What are you doing?

08:37.251 --> 08:38.753
I am preparing to run a scan

08:38.786 --> 08:40.120
on the section of the Orville

08:40.154 --> 08:41.922
that came into contact
with the anomaly.

08:41.956 --> 08:45.192
-Can we help?
-No. You are small and feeble.

08:45.225 --> 08:48.028
And you do not possess
the necessary intelligence.

08:48.062 --> 08:49.696
Wow, why don't you just
give 'em wedgies

08:49.730 --> 08:51.766
and stuff 'em in a locker
while you're at it?

08:51.799 --> 08:53.667
Please, Isaac?

08:53.700 --> 08:55.202
Very well.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.104
But do not interfere
with our investigation.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.311
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what the hell
is he doing here?

09:04.344 --> 09:06.981
Commander Grayson has
assigned Lieutenant Lamarr

09:07.014 --> 09:08.682
to assist with the analysis.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.350
Look, Yaphit, I-I'm sorry
about what happened earlier.

09:10.384 --> 09:11.651
You know, we were
just messing around.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.020
You know, it was a joke.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.123
A joke? I spent an hour
in Bortus' colon!

09:16.156 --> 09:17.357
You think that's funny?

09:17.391 --> 09:19.093
(laughing)

09:19.126 --> 09:20.895
Oh, yeah,
laugh it up, you brats.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.629
Look, I promise
it won't happen again.

09:22.662 --> 09:23.898
Did you find anything here?

09:23.931 --> 09:26.266
Some crazy-weird readings.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.035
I can't make sense of 'em.

09:32.139 --> 09:35.042
Scans are detecting
the presence of a quantum wake.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.177
It doesn't look like
anything's been disturbed.

09:37.211 --> 09:38.578
I'm assuming nobody was in here.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.014
Affirmative.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.149
These quarters are
currently unoccupied.

09:42.182 --> 09:45.085
We will process the data
through the central computer.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.556
What happened to the plants?

10:09.309 --> 10:12.579
We are currently analyzing
the scans of the quantum wake.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.481
And there's no explanation
for the dead plants?

10:14.514 --> 10:16.583
We're cross-referencing
the bioscans of the plants

10:16.616 --> 10:18.118
with what we know
about the anomaly,

10:18.152 --> 10:19.753
which, right now, isn't much.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.922
They've been watered, right?

10:21.956 --> 10:23.390
Like, do we have a...
a plant guy?

10:23.423 --> 10:25.559
Palovis. He's the
lizard-looking guy

10:25.592 --> 10:27.561
-in the science section.
-Is that his name?

10:27.594 --> 10:29.229
God, I can never remember
that guy's name.

10:29.263 --> 10:31.231
I see him coming in the hall,
and he's always like,

10:31.265 --> 10:32.232
"Hey, good morning, Captain."
And I'm always like,

10:32.266 --> 10:33.233
"H-Hey, there he is."

10:33.267 --> 10:34.368
Yeah, Palovis.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.569
Palovis.
All right.

10:35.602 --> 10:38.272
Doctor, does this quantum wake

10:38.305 --> 10:39.773
pose any health hazard
to the crew?

10:39.806 --> 10:42.242
A quantum disturbance
isn't like radiation.

10:42.276 --> 10:43.810
Shouldn't have any effect
on living tissue.

10:43.844 --> 10:47.447
But I must admit,
the dead plants are a mystery.

10:47.481 --> 10:48.916
How long until we can be
underway?

10:48.949 --> 10:50.117
Engine realignment
will be completed

10:50.150 --> 10:52.586
in two hours, 31 minutes.

10:52.619 --> 10:53.988
Keep me posted.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.622
Dismissed.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.464
-(door chimes)
-Come in.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.867
Hi.

11:06.901 --> 11:08.502
Hey.

11:08.535 --> 11:11.671
I was wondering
if you had any thoughts

11:11.705 --> 11:12.672
about what we discussed.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.341
As a matter of fact, I have.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.742
Given what's happened,

11:15.775 --> 11:17.577
I think we need
to fill the post right away.

11:17.611 --> 11:19.179
So I'm promoting Yaphit.

11:19.213 --> 11:22.182
Ed, before you make
that decision,

11:22.216 --> 11:24.684
I'm asking you
to please consider John.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.386
Yaphit is next in line
on the roster.

11:26.420 --> 11:27.922
Besides, do you honestly think

11:27.955 --> 11:29.856
John would even want the job?

11:29.890 --> 11:32.159
I mean, he doesn't exactly seem
that ambitious.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.194
I have a suggestion.

11:34.228 --> 11:36.530
We have a mystery on our hands
with this anomaly.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.332
Let me put John in charge
of the analysis team.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.633
Kelly, it's too...

11:39.666 --> 11:41.668
If he's as smart
as his record indicates,

11:41.701 --> 11:42.903
then he deserves a shot.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.341
You really feel
that strongly about this?

11:47.374 --> 11:48.976
I'm your first officer.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.377
Part of my job
is to help assemble

11:50.410 --> 11:52.412
the best possible staff
on board this ship.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.383
All right.
We'll give him a shot.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.986
Hell, your instincts are
usually good, so who knows?

11:59.019 --> 12:01.688
Hey, you wouldn't be sitting
there if I...

12:01.721 --> 12:03.123
Sorry, what?

12:03.157 --> 12:05.092
Nothing. It was a joke.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.927
Didn't sound like a joke.

12:06.961 --> 12:08.228
Forget about it.

12:08.262 --> 12:10.297
I'm gonna go tell John,
get him started.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.533
Kelly.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.702
Did you...

12:15.735 --> 12:19.706
say something to Admiral Halsey
to get me this command?

12:19.739 --> 12:22.542
No, of course not.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.612
Oh, my God, you did.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.217
All I said was that I thought
you deserved a chance.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.987
You went to Admiral Halsey
and you asked him

12:33.020 --> 12:34.621
to give me command
of the Orville.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.323
I put in a good word.
That's all I did.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.725
To an admiral who just happened
to be close to your father.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.260
That had nothing to do with it.

12:40.294 --> 12:42.396
Ed, I had spent a year

12:42.429 --> 12:44.564
feeling like a horrible person
for cheating on you.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.733
I also knew I was the reason
that you went into your slump.

12:46.766 --> 12:50.137
I wanted to help get you back
on the right path.

12:50.170 --> 12:53.373
I wanted to do something to help
make things better for you.

12:53.407 --> 12:54.874
Well, thank God for your help.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.611
You would have gotten a command
sooner or later, anyway.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.613
I mean, you were top
of your class at Union Point.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.081
Oh, I'm sorry,
didn't you just say

13:01.115 --> 13:02.816
that I wouldn't be sitting here

13:02.849 --> 13:04.118
if you hadn't gone
to bat for me?

13:04.151 --> 13:05.385
I didn't mean
to put it that way.

13:05.419 --> 13:06.786
And besides, it isn't true.

13:06.820 --> 13:10.424
Well, I guess
we'll never know, huh?

13:10.457 --> 13:13.460
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.796
So am I.

13:36.550 --> 13:38.352
Look, I don't want you
to mince words.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.953
I don't want you
to spare my feelings.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.988
I just want to know the truth.

13:42.022 --> 13:45.792
Commander Grayson
did make a case

13:45.825 --> 13:47.527
for your promotion to captain.

13:47.561 --> 13:49.796
And it never occurred to anyone
that that might be

13:49.829 --> 13:51.365
the kind of thing
that I deserve to know?

13:51.398 --> 13:53.167
Allocation of fleet personnel

13:53.200 --> 13:56.336
and how we arrive at those
decisions is our business.

13:56.370 --> 13:57.571
It was her choice to tell you.

13:57.604 --> 13:58.972
Admiral, I'm just,

13:59.005 --> 14:00.374
I'm just having a little bit
of a tough time

14:00.407 --> 14:02.776
reconciling this
with my current position.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.278
I mean, how the hell
am I ever supposed

14:04.311 --> 14:06.213
to walk onto that bridge
with confidence again?

14:06.246 --> 14:08.448
Ed, in the eyes
of the admiralty,

14:08.482 --> 14:10.917
you've proven yourself worthy
of that chair.

14:10.950 --> 14:13.887
You have validated
our trust in you.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.523
There is no doubt
in anyone's mind anymore.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.625
Except mine.

14:20.594 --> 14:22.062
(sighs)

14:24.364 --> 14:26.533
Hey, would anybody mind
if I got a cat?

14:26.566 --> 14:27.867
What?

14:27.901 --> 14:29.769
A cat, for the bridge.

14:29.803 --> 14:31.505
Like a bridge cat.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.173
What is a cat?

14:33.207 --> 14:34.374
Oh, it's an Earth pet.

14:34.408 --> 14:35.675
Little furry thing with
whiskers.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.377
Might warm
the place up a little.

14:37.411 --> 14:38.945
I think that'd be really great.

14:38.978 --> 14:40.880
How would the presence
of such a creature

14:40.914 --> 14:42.682
improve bridge operations?

14:42.716 --> 14:44.017
It's not about that.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.186
Animals are just fun
to have around.

14:46.220 --> 14:48.054
It's unconditional love,
you know?

14:48.088 --> 14:50.357
I do not. Please, elaborate.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.725
GORDON:
It's just companionship.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.360
You cuddle with it,
stroke its fur.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.562
Humans bond with animals
that way.

14:55.595 --> 14:56.596
Try it sometime.

14:56.630 --> 14:58.198
It'll help you understand us.

14:58.232 --> 14:59.666
(over comm):
Grayson to Lieutenant Lamarr,

14:59.699 --> 15:00.867
report to my office.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.902
Oh, great. What did I do now?

15:02.936 --> 15:04.671
Good luck.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.642
(fabric swooshing)

15:14.248 --> 15:16.350
Are we bonding?

15:18.952 --> 15:20.220
(door chimes)

15:20.254 --> 15:21.221
Come in.

15:21.255 --> 15:24.824
Lieutenant. Have a seat.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.196
Explain this.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.701
What do you want to know?

15:34.734 --> 15:36.236
Why you never told anyone.

15:36.270 --> 15:37.604
It's in my file.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.706
-Anyone can look it up.
-I know that.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.742
But generally, when someone's
as smart as you are,

15:42.776 --> 15:44.711
they make productive use of it.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.713
Well, with all due respect,
Commander,

15:46.746 --> 15:48.248
that's my business.

15:50.284 --> 15:53.987
Lieutenant, have you ever
studied the history of money?

15:54.020 --> 15:56.290
Not really.
I know people used to use it

15:56.323 --> 15:59.125
-to buy houses and sandwiches
and stuff. -Exactly.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.961
It became obsolete with the
invention of matter synthesis.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.831
The predominant currency
became reputation.

16:04.864 --> 16:05.965
Yeah, so?

16:05.999 --> 16:09.569
My point is, human ambition
didn't vanish.

16:09.603 --> 16:12.872
The only thing that changed
was how we quantify wealth.

16:12.906 --> 16:14.708
People still want to be rich,

16:14.741 --> 16:17.911
only now rich means
being the best at what you do.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.679
Not everybody wants that.

16:19.713 --> 16:21.648
Some people like
to keep it simple.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.283
Some people want to go to work,

16:23.317 --> 16:25.452
go home, drink a beer
and pass out.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.653
Are you one of those people?

16:26.686 --> 16:27.954
I am very fond

16:27.987 --> 16:29.623
of drinking beer
and passing out, yes.

16:29.656 --> 16:33.360
Look, Lieutenant,
there's nothing wrong

16:33.393 --> 16:35.061
with a simple lifestyle.

16:35.094 --> 16:37.331
I just want you
to try using your gifts

16:37.364 --> 16:40.367
before you decide
to leave them untapped.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.801
I'm putting you in command

16:41.835 --> 16:43.237
of the science and engineering
task force

16:43.270 --> 16:44.671
to investigate the anomaly.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.706
(sighs)

16:47.774 --> 16:49.376
What is it?

16:49.409 --> 16:51.878
A small ship entering range,
Captain.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.680
If it continues
on its present course,

16:53.713 --> 16:55.582
it will encounter the anomaly.

16:55.615 --> 16:56.716
Put it on the viewer.

16:56.750 --> 16:59.719
GORDON:
Ugh. Horbalak smugglers.

16:59.753 --> 17:01.488
Hate those guys.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.890
Alara, hail them.

17:03.923 --> 17:05.592
You're on, sir.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.262
Unidentified vessel,
this is the USS Orville.

17:08.295 --> 17:09.496
Please respond.

17:11.565 --> 17:13.400
What do you want?

17:13.433 --> 17:15.602
Your course is about to take you

17:15.635 --> 17:17.471
directly into the path
of a spatial anomaly

17:17.504 --> 17:18.905
we've discovered.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.707
We recommend you change
your heading immediately.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.877
Grahj-kalooga.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.479
Anybody speak Horbalak?

17:25.512 --> 17:27.547
The direct translation is,

17:27.581 --> 17:30.216
-"You can shove it up your..."
-Okay, got it, got it.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.718
Do you wish to hear
the rest of the translation?

17:31.751 --> 17:33.219
No, no, I-I get the gist.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.788
Listen, what's your name?

17:34.821 --> 17:36.723
Blavaroch.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.925
God, that generation has
so many Blavarochs.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.894
Blavaroch, I promise you,

17:40.927 --> 17:43.062
we're not out to confiscate
whatever's in your cargo hold.

17:43.096 --> 17:46.366
We just want you to change
course for your own safety.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.934
And maybe find a napkin.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.904
I don't take orders
from Union goons.

17:50.937 --> 17:54.308
And my scanners
don't show any anomaly.

17:54.341 --> 17:55.642
Well, our scanners do.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.043
Now change course.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.378
Alara, get him back.

17:58.412 --> 18:00.714
Trying, sir. No response.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.582
Sir, the Horbalak ship
is approaching the anomaly.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.698
No power signature
from the Horbalak vessel.

18:18.732 --> 18:19.766
Life signs?

18:19.799 --> 18:22.201
-None.
-Bortus, you have the conn.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.737
Tell Kelly and Dr. Finn
to meet us in the shuttle bay.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.271
Alara, you're with me.

18:31.077 --> 18:34.080
♪

18:48.428 --> 18:51.598
♪

19:06.746 --> 19:09.749
Oh, my God.

19:29.268 --> 19:31.237
ED:
What have you got?

19:31.270 --> 19:32.839
It looks like extreme
traumatic shock,

19:32.872 --> 19:34.240
leading to cardiac arrest.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.243
The whole power grid is out,

19:37.276 --> 19:39.278
and that's not all.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.981
Found this in the cargo hold.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.587
Krill plasma rifles.

19:47.621 --> 19:50.156
-About 20 crates.
-Oh, boy.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.658
ALARA: You can bet
whoever he stole them from

19:51.691 --> 19:52.992
is gonna be looking for them.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.694
We're sitting
on a Krill lightning rod.

19:54.728 --> 19:57.697
We have to get that engine
back on line fast.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.876
-Ed, we need to talk.
-It'll have to wait.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.378
I've got to finish my report
for Union Central.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.082
You can't ignore me forever.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.851
I'm not ignoring you.
I'm just very busy.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.218
I was only doing
what I thought was right.

20:19.252 --> 20:20.386
-I know that.
-Well, then talk to me.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.921
Okay, you want to talk?

20:21.955 --> 20:24.558
Okay, let's talk about the fact
that from now on,

20:24.591 --> 20:28.227
I am going to second-guess every
command decision I make ever

20:28.261 --> 20:30.564
because I will never know
whether I am truly the person

20:30.597 --> 20:32.866
who deserves to be making
those decisions.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.834
It doesn't have to be that way.

20:34.868 --> 20:36.169
For God's sake, look at Gordon.

20:36.202 --> 20:37.203
What? What about Gordon?

20:37.236 --> 20:39.706
How did he get this job?
You fought for him.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.008
Oh, wow, so now you're saying
you had to fight for me.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.543
(laughing): This just gets
better and better, doesn't it?

20:43.577 --> 20:46.212
No. Look, you told me today

20:46.245 --> 20:47.714
that you trust my instincts.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.916
So trust me about you.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.551
I believed in you.

20:51.585 --> 20:53.753
And as I stand here today,
so do the admirals.

20:53.787 --> 20:55.522
Maybe they do now.

20:55.555 --> 20:58.191
But who knows whether I would
ever have had the chance

20:58.224 --> 21:01.928
to prove that without
a handout from my ex-wife.

21:05.899 --> 21:07.200
Hi, Captain.

21:07.233 --> 21:09.268
H-Hey, there he is.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.108
Yaphit, what are you doing here?

21:15.141 --> 21:16.610
I have a grievance.

21:16.643 --> 21:17.811
How'd you get into my office?

21:17.844 --> 21:19.546
I'm gel.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.881
Right.
Well, what's on your mind?

21:21.915 --> 21:24.584
I want to know
why you guys put John in charge

21:24.618 --> 21:26.553
of the science team
instead of me.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.154
(sighs)

21:28.187 --> 21:30.123
Commander Grayson and I
both feel

21:30.156 --> 21:32.391
that Lieutenant Lamarr
deserves to be in the running

21:32.425 --> 21:33.960
for chief engineer.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.895
What?!
You got to be kidding me.

21:35.929 --> 21:37.864
What the hell has that son of
a bitch ever done to deserve...

21:37.897 --> 21:39.833
No final decisions
have been made,

21:39.866 --> 21:41.935
and I am aware that you're
next in line for the job,

21:41.968 --> 21:45.071
but we have our reasons
for considering him.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.806
It's 'cause I'm gelatinous,
isn't it?

21:46.840 --> 21:49.142
You guys can't handle
the thought

21:49.175 --> 21:51.110
of a gelatinous person
in charge of a department.

21:51.144 --> 21:53.046
Yaphit, that is not it.

21:53.079 --> 21:55.649
This is so racist, man,
you're so friggin' racist.

21:55.682 --> 21:58.317
I am not, I have several
gelatinous friends.

21:58.351 --> 21:59.753
This is a bunch of crap, man.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.220
This is total crap.

22:01.254 --> 22:02.822
Permission to return to duty.

22:02.856 --> 22:04.490
Granted.

22:06.526 --> 22:07.961
You know what?

22:07.994 --> 22:11.464
There was less crap
in Bortus's colon.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.499
(doors whoosh shut)

22:18.371 --> 22:20.774
(indistinct conversations
nearby)

22:40.560 --> 22:41.828
Hey, man.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.630
Hey.

22:43.663 --> 22:45.531
I just got off duty.
You want to go tie one on?

22:45.565 --> 22:46.833
I can't right now.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.835
Why are you just
standing out here?

22:48.868 --> 22:50.369
The science team's in there.

22:50.403 --> 22:52.371
I got to go inside
and be the boss.

22:52.405 --> 22:54.207
Oh, dude, that sucks.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.809
I'm not a commander.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.677
I don't know anything
about being in charge.

22:57.711 --> 23:00.046
You know, when I was a teenager,

23:00.079 --> 23:02.381
I worked as a camp counselor
one summer.

23:02.415 --> 23:05.151
And when we wanted to break the
ice with a new group of kids,

23:05.184 --> 23:06.620
we'd have this bowl
of gumdrops, right?

23:06.653 --> 23:08.287
And each kid would take one.

23:08.321 --> 23:11.057
But they didn't get to eat it
until they'd told the group

23:11.090 --> 23:13.392
something interesting
about themselves.

23:13.426 --> 23:14.728
And-and that broke the ice?

23:14.761 --> 23:16.195
Every time.

23:16.229 --> 23:17.631
Yeah, but these aren't kids.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.532
Dude. Do you like gumdrops?

23:19.565 --> 23:21.367
-I do.
-Exactly.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.435
(claps shoulder)

23:22.468 --> 23:23.803
Everybody likes gumdrops.

23:29.442 --> 23:30.610
Okay, there you go.

23:30.644 --> 23:32.211
Everybody get one.

23:32.245 --> 23:34.047
That's it. Yeah, you get--
there you go.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.581
Everybody take one.

23:35.615 --> 23:37.583
Okay. Uh-huh. Everybody got one?

23:37.617 --> 23:40.920
Okay, now you can't eat it
until after you tell...

23:40.954 --> 23:42.288
Hey!

23:42.321 --> 23:43.623
Damn it, what did I just say?

23:43.657 --> 23:45.391
-Sorry.
-I said don't eat it yet.

23:45.424 --> 23:48.061
-It just looks really good.
-You know what? You go first.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.196
Tell everybody something
interesting about yourself.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.902
I love refinishing
antique furniture.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.737
The texture, the grain.

23:57.771 --> 23:59.605
It's like it has
a life of its own.

23:59.639 --> 24:03.342
Sometimes, I can't tell
where I end and the wood begins.

24:03.376 --> 24:04.778
Also a big brunch guy.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.345
Banana walnut pancakes?

24:06.379 --> 24:08.447
Mouthgasm.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.583
-This is stupid.
-What's stupid?

24:10.616 --> 24:12.118
This. They put you
in charge of the team,

24:12.151 --> 24:13.820
and you're dicking around
like an amateur.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.955
We should be analyzing the data
from the anomaly,

24:15.989 --> 24:17.791
and you're playing
duck, duck, goose.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.859
You know what? He's right.
Give it back.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.227
-Aww. -Put it back.
Everybody, put it back.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.929
You don't get a gumdrop.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.563
Now get-get to work.
Everybody move.

24:24.597 --> 24:26.833
Go... go do something.

24:29.302 --> 24:30.937
(sighs)

24:35.108 --> 24:38.077
Lieutenant,
if I may make an observation,

24:38.111 --> 24:41.280
you seem ill-suited
to perform your assigned duties.

24:41.314 --> 24:43.116
Yeah, that's what I tried
to tell Commander Grayson.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.151
Then why did she place you
in command?

24:45.184 --> 24:46.753
She says it's 'cause I'm smart.

24:46.786 --> 24:50.356
I would be happy to inform her
that you are not.

24:52.425 --> 24:54.093
Hey, wait a minute.

24:54.127 --> 24:56.529
-JOHN: Look at this.
-The quantum phasing signature

24:56.562 --> 25:00.599
of the anomaly does not conform
to the universal constant.

25:00.633 --> 25:03.669
Oh, my God. It's not a pothole.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.705
It's a doorway.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.654
A doorway to where?

25:21.687 --> 25:23.689
We believe the anomaly
is an aperture

25:23.723 --> 25:26.359
leading to a pocket
of two-dimensional space.

25:26.392 --> 25:28.995
-Beg pardon? -We all exist
in three dimensions, right?

25:29.028 --> 25:30.864
Length, width, height.

25:30.897 --> 25:33.699
But this area of space
only exists in the first two,

25:33.733 --> 25:35.735
-length and width.
-Has anything like this

25:35.769 --> 25:37.904
-ever been discovered before?
-Negative.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.839
All right. First.

25:39.873 --> 25:42.341
-What happened to the Horbalak
vessel? -ISAAC: When the vessel

25:42.375 --> 25:44.710
crossed through the anomaly,
it momentarily phased

25:44.744 --> 25:46.846
from three dimensions into two.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.782
No wonder that man died.

25:48.815 --> 25:51.050
What do you mean?

25:51.084 --> 25:53.719
Living cells are made
out of protein molecules,

25:53.753 --> 25:56.222
which have complex,
three-dimensional geometries.

25:56.255 --> 25:59.558
How they react with other
molecules is precisely

25:59.592 --> 26:01.360
controlled by their shapes.

26:01.394 --> 26:03.963
So if they get squeezed flat,
and they don't expand

26:03.997 --> 26:05.832
into exactly the same shape
as before,

26:05.865 --> 26:07.801
the proteins won't
function properly.

26:07.834 --> 26:11.237
Exactly. And without working
proteins, the cells die.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.873
Then that's probably
why the plants died, too.

26:13.907 --> 26:17.710
Is there any way we can
get a look inside the doorway?

26:17.743 --> 26:19.578
-Maybe send a probe? -MALE (over
comm): Captain to the bridge.

26:19.612 --> 26:21.815
Three Krill ships approaching.

26:21.848 --> 26:25.051
Looks like our time
just ran out.

26:28.387 --> 26:29.923
How far are they?

26:29.956 --> 26:31.724
Estimated time to intercept:
31 minutes.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.927
Isaac, how long until the engine
realignment is complete?

26:33.960 --> 26:35.728
One hour, 16 minutes.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.530
Oh, crap, we're in trouble.

26:37.563 --> 26:39.632
Guys, I have a way the hell
out there idea.

26:39.665 --> 26:41.935
-What is it?
-We can't go to quantum speed,

26:41.968 --> 26:44.137
but the field generator
is still powered up.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.738
We might be able to create
a quantum bubble

26:45.771 --> 26:46.940
around the Orville.

26:46.973 --> 26:48.107
And?

26:48.141 --> 26:50.276
And go through the doorway.

26:50.309 --> 26:51.811
Wait, I'm sorry, didn't you just
tell us that passing through

26:51.845 --> 26:53.612
that anomaly would be
a death sentence?

26:53.646 --> 26:56.115
The quantum bubble could protect
us from two-dimensional space.

26:56.149 --> 26:59.886
We go inside, we hang out and
wait until the Krill are gone.

26:59.919 --> 27:02.388
-Isaac?
-It is theoretically possible.

27:02.421 --> 27:04.891
Sir, the Krill
have increased speed.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.360
Estimated time to intercept:
14 minutes.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.831
All right, go.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.572
Try it now.

27:19.605 --> 27:22.075
Field stability is now at 68%.

27:22.108 --> 27:23.910
(sighs)
That's still not enough.

27:23.943 --> 27:26.545
John, what if we couple
the quantum phase inducers

27:26.579 --> 27:27.947
to the deflector grid?

27:27.981 --> 27:29.682
It might beef up
the strength of the bubble.

27:29.715 --> 27:31.384
How the hell
is that supposed to hold?

27:31.417 --> 27:32.852
If we match
the deflector amplitude

27:32.886 --> 27:34.387
to the quantum wave function,

27:34.420 --> 27:35.889
it should compensate
for any field instability.

27:35.922 --> 27:37.891
I like when you talk dirty.

27:37.924 --> 27:39.558
All right, let's give it a shot.

27:39.592 --> 27:42.061
Captain, the Krill vessels
are closing.

27:42.095 --> 27:43.662
Lamarr, what's happening?

27:43.696 --> 27:45.031
Commander, I think we're ready.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.532
All right, fire it up.

27:49.002 --> 27:50.736
Field strength at 95%.

27:50.769 --> 27:52.071
That's close enough.

27:52.105 --> 27:54.673
Bridge, initiating
quantum bubble.

28:02.115 --> 28:03.416
Ready on your order, Captain.

28:03.449 --> 28:05.051
Take us into the anomaly.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.820
Hold on to your asses.

28:17.630 --> 28:21.134
No sign of the Krill ships,
Captain.

28:26.672 --> 28:29.042
I'm not surprised.

28:29.075 --> 28:31.244
My God.

29:01.941 --> 29:05.678
It's beautiful.

29:05.711 --> 29:07.913
But how are we seeing it?

29:07.947 --> 29:10.549
Lieutenant Lamarr's
quantum bubble has allowed us

29:10.583 --> 29:12.685
to maintain
a stable third dimension

29:12.718 --> 29:15.321
outside of
two-dimensional space.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.290
What are all
those energy pulses?

29:17.323 --> 29:20.259
ISAAC: I have no experience
processing this kind of data,

29:20.293 --> 29:21.927
but I believe
we may be looking at

29:21.961 --> 29:24.130
a two-dimensional civilization.

29:24.163 --> 29:25.999
Two-dimensional life-forms?

29:26.032 --> 29:27.500
How is that possible?

29:27.533 --> 29:30.303
Is there any way we can
communicate with them?

29:30.336 --> 29:33.939
Negative. Our modes of existence
are incompatible.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.941
Then get every bit
of scanning data you can.

29:35.975 --> 29:39.612
Union physicists will be writing
papers about this for decades.

29:39.645 --> 29:42.781
Well, if we can't talk to them,
at least we can watch.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.783
GORDON:
Wait, so,

29:44.817 --> 29:46.752
does that mean
that there could be fourth-,

29:46.785 --> 29:49.855
or fifth-dimensional people
watching us right now?

29:49.888 --> 29:52.258
-It is possible.
-But do you think...

29:52.291 --> 29:55.928
I mean, they wouldn't, like...
watch us all the time, right?

29:55.961 --> 29:57.296
I do not know.

29:57.330 --> 29:58.998
I mean, do you think, like,

29:59.032 --> 30:02.435
could they see
under a blanket, or...

30:02.468 --> 30:04.703
in the s-sleeve of a down coat?

30:04.737 --> 30:06.239
Gordon, I don't know what you're
driving at, but I'm gonna

30:06.272 --> 30:07.806
go ahead and change
the subject. Isaac,

30:07.840 --> 30:09.775
-what's our status?
-The anomaly is stable.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.278
We can return to normal space
on your order.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.979
All right,
we'll give it a few hours.

30:14.013 --> 30:16.115
The Krill should be
gone by then.

30:42.175 --> 30:43.376
Hi.

30:45.278 --> 30:47.146
Hey.

30:47.180 --> 30:48.381
Can we talk?

30:55.821 --> 30:58.023
It's breathtaking, isn't it?

30:58.057 --> 31:00.793
Did you ever read Flatland?

31:00.826 --> 31:02.695
No.

31:02.728 --> 31:04.697
It was a story
written in the 1880s,

31:04.730 --> 31:08.033
about a two-dimensional society
of shapes.

31:08.067 --> 31:10.669
The more sides they had,
the higher the social status.

31:10.703 --> 31:12.371
The triangles
were the workman class,

31:12.405 --> 31:14.073
the squares were the gentry,

31:14.107 --> 31:16.542
the circles were
the most respected of all.

31:16.575 --> 31:20.413
It was a metaphor
for inequality.

31:22.415 --> 31:24.417
I wonder what kind of world
that is.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.519
Listen.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.854
Can I be honest with you?

31:28.887 --> 31:30.689
Of course.

31:30.723 --> 31:32.758
I want you and I to be okay.

31:32.791 --> 31:35.661
But you were being
a prideful ass.

31:35.694 --> 31:37.029
What, are we in
a Jane Austen novel?

31:37.062 --> 31:38.531
I'm a "prideful ass"?

31:38.564 --> 31:41.066
Why? Because I want
to be self-reliant?

31:41.100 --> 31:43.202
Because I want to feel
like I got where I am alone?

31:43.236 --> 31:45.871
I don't know if your
two-dimensional perception

31:45.904 --> 31:47.873
leaves any room
for this concept,

31:47.906 --> 31:50.709
but nobody does anything alone.

31:50.743 --> 31:52.711
We all have people
who help us along the way.

31:52.745 --> 31:54.913
Sometimes we know about it,
sometimes we don't.

31:54.947 --> 31:56.882
But it doesn't take a damn thing
away from you.

31:56.915 --> 32:00.219
So what is so horrible
about speaking up?

32:00.253 --> 32:02.054
This is already
the worst apology ever.

32:02.087 --> 32:05.524
You know, the reason
you are a good captain

32:05.558 --> 32:09.595
is that you are great at seeing
all sides of a problem,

32:09.628 --> 32:11.364
except when it comes
to yourself.

32:11.397 --> 32:15.401
So, no, I am not sorry that
I recommended you to Halsey

32:15.434 --> 32:17.770
because I get to work
for a captain that I respect,

32:17.803 --> 32:21.240
and I get to see you
every day.

32:23.176 --> 32:24.877
Look.

32:24.910 --> 32:28.781
I know what you did
came from a good place.

32:28.814 --> 32:32.185
I just have to work this out
on my own.

32:34.587 --> 32:37.223
Commander, I am reading
a small fluctuation

32:37.256 --> 32:38.857
in the quantum bubble.

32:38.891 --> 32:39.992
What is the cause?

32:40.025 --> 32:41.827
It appears
the power flow to the...

32:41.860 --> 32:44.297
(grunting)

33:09.755 --> 33:11.824
Mercer to bridge. Report!

33:11.857 --> 33:14.460
Captain, the quantum bubble
is deteriorating.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.362
We better hope
the Krill are gone.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.364
Gordon, return us
to normal space.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.333
Um, I can't do that, sir.

33:20.366 --> 33:22.868
ED:
Why not?

33:22.901 --> 33:24.737
The anomaly just closed up.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.320
ISAAC:
The disruption we experienced

33:41.354 --> 33:44.156
was due to inverse polarization
of the quantum bubble.

33:44.189 --> 33:47.860
Essentially, two-dimensional
space is pulling us toward it.

33:47.893 --> 33:49.662
That's why we got
the nosebleeds.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.196
That was very unpleasant.

33:51.230 --> 33:53.499
We have about 21 minutes
until the bubble collapses

33:53.532 --> 33:55.368
and we all
get turned into pancakes.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.135
Oh, you guys talking
about pancakes?

33:57.169 --> 33:58.871
No, it's-it's something else.

33:58.904 --> 34:00.306
All right, how do we
get out of here?

34:00.339 --> 34:02.040
The engines were exposed
to two-dimensional space.

34:02.074 --> 34:03.542
They're dead.

34:03.576 --> 34:06.245
There may be
another way out, Captain.

34:06.279 --> 34:08.714
Scanners have detected
a quantum fluctuation

34:08.747 --> 34:10.449
4,000 kilometers away

34:10.483 --> 34:12.485
that could be another aperture
back to normal space.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.219
Could be?

34:14.253 --> 34:15.888
There is no way to know.

34:15.921 --> 34:17.823
Okay, let's say
that's our only way out.

34:17.856 --> 34:19.658
The engines are dead.
How do we get there?

34:19.692 --> 34:20.859
The ship's engines are dead,

34:20.893 --> 34:22.194
but the shuttles
are still working.

34:22.227 --> 34:24.229
We cannot all fit
inside a shuttle.

34:24.263 --> 34:26.599
No, but we could use the shuttle
to tow the Orville out

34:26.632 --> 34:28.200
with a beefed-up tractor beam.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.868
But, wouldn't that
expose the shuttle

34:29.902 --> 34:31.270
to two-dimensional space?

34:31.304 --> 34:33.539
I think we could create
a stable quantum bubble

34:33.572 --> 34:36.041
inside the shuttle, and preserve
three-dimensional space.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.910
So, the outside
would be squashed,

34:37.943 --> 34:39.712
but the inside wouldn't.

34:39.745 --> 34:43.148
More space inside than out,
like Doctor Who's phone booth.

34:43.181 --> 34:44.417
Or Oscar the Grouch's can.

34:44.450 --> 34:45.884
Or Snoopy's doghouse, yeah.

34:45.918 --> 34:48.053
The miracles of quantum physics.

34:48.086 --> 34:51.557
Would this pose any danger to
the two-dimensional life-forms?

34:51.590 --> 34:53.892
No, sir.
The cross section is so small

34:53.926 --> 34:56.395
that they will likely be
unaware of our presence.

34:56.429 --> 34:57.896
Who pilots the shuttle?

34:57.930 --> 34:59.264
Well, I would need to be there

34:59.298 --> 35:00.733
to keep the field intensity
stable,

35:00.766 --> 35:02.267
and I'd need somebody to drive.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.069

35:04.102 --> 35:05.771
No. I'll go.

the power relays?

35:52.918 --> 35:55.421
Oh, will do.

Yeah, try not to
screw that up, too.

Now, you listen to me,

36:05.263 --> 36:06.565
Yaphit's a member of our team,

36:06.599 --> 36:08.000
and you're gonna
treat him that way.

36:08.033 --> 36:10.035
He had an idea and I thought
it was a good one.

36:10.068 --> 36:11.837
I made the decision
to go with it.

blame somebody, you blame me.
