00:56.883 --> 00:59.758
- Did you guys hang out last night?
- Yeah. You should have been with us.

00:59.883 --> 01:03.342
- We took a whole six-pack from Dylan's dad.
- It was my idea.

01:03.467 --> 01:05.758
No way! Did you guys,
like, get drunk and stuff?

01:05.883 --> 01:09.008
I don't remember a thing.
I blacked right out.

01:09.133 --> 01:13.258
- You only had a sip, you loser.
- Dill Pickle got scared.

01:13.383 --> 01:15.967
Don't call me that, Lyle!

01:24.217 --> 01:26.633
Rebecca, be careful!

01:33.842 --> 01:36.175
We're gonna get, like,
a 12-pack this time.

01:36.300 --> 01:39.508
I had to be the lookout.
I can't drink when I'm on the job.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.800
Like your dad's gonna wake up?

01:42.008 --> 01:45.008
- The bell rang, boys.
- Whatever, Mr. Howard.

01:45.216 --> 01:47.675
It's just all a joke to you guys?

01:47.800 --> 01:50.591
Let's see how funny these test scores are.

02:48.800 --> 02:52.633
- Honey, jump off!
- Look at that girl!

02:56.300 --> 02:57.966
Dylan, please get back in your seat.

02:58.925 --> 03:01.675
Dylan? Dylan!

03:01.800 --> 03:04.216
- Is he okay, Mr. Howard?
- I don't know. Dylan, buddy.

03:04.341 --> 03:07.633
- What's wrong with him, Bo?
- Dylan, wake up. Hey, Dylan.

03:08.216 --> 03:10.716
Oh, my God. Rebecca!

03:10.841 --> 03:12.925
Rebecca, wake up!

03:13.050 --> 03:16.466
Rebecca, honey! Please wake up.

04:11.133 --> 04:14.050
Dylan, my man.
You gotta get yourself some new porn.

04:16.257 --> 04:19.591
- You want a beer?
- I'm on the clock. Where you been?

04:19.716 --> 04:22.007
- Out.
- Christ, boy.

04:22.132 --> 04:25.050
You cleaned the spark plugs
of that fold-by with your goddamn tongue

04:25.175 --> 04:27.758
and you can't sweep up in here
every once in a while?

04:27.883 --> 04:31.800
- The only one comes around is you.
- Then you should make an effort.

04:32.716 --> 04:36.675
- Where you been?
- Carwash. Got an extra shift.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.883
- Bullshit.
- Call 'em.

04:39.008 --> 04:41.800
- Think I won't?
- Think you should.

04:41.925 --> 04:43.758
Have you been associating
with any known criminals?

04:43.883 --> 04:45.591
No, sir. I have not.

04:45.716 --> 04:48.883
Have you crossed over
the state line at any time?

04:49.008 --> 04:51.050
No, sir, I have not.

04:52.133 --> 04:56.300
- How's the job going?
- Well, it's boring, but it's still mine.

04:57.966 --> 05:01.050
Two months. Gotta be some kind of record.

05:01.841 --> 05:03.300
Anything else you need to know?

05:03.425 --> 05:07.175
I need to know when you're gonna slip up
and stick your pecker in the grits again.

05:07.300 --> 05:10.799
This may be a dumb question,
but what did I ever do to you?

05:16.133 --> 05:19.424
You went into other people's houses
and took things that didn't belong to you,

05:19.549 --> 05:21.841
things that they worked long and hard for.

05:21.966 --> 05:26.758
And I paid my debt, Giddons.
My conscience is shiny and new.

05:27.133 --> 05:29.133
Yeah, well, how about Bo and Lyle?

05:29.258 --> 05:33.258
- Bo and Lyle weren't on that job.
- So the record states.

05:33.383 --> 05:37.466
That is real sweet of you to take
the hit for your old school buddies.

05:37.633 --> 05:42.174
Giddons. All due respect,
you're not a detective. You're my P.O.

05:43.049 --> 05:47.549
And I know that you ride me
more than most. Why?

05:48.341 --> 05:52.341
You're smart. And ain't nothin'
in this world dumber than a smart guy.

05:52.758 --> 05:58.049
A smart man, he sees beyond
his little world and it kind of warps him.

05:58.174 --> 06:00.133
So when he makes that wrong move,

06:00.258 --> 06:03.549
and you will... it tends to be messy.

06:03.674 --> 06:07.674
Well, maybe there's a side
of me you don't see.

06:08.008 --> 06:12.091
As long as you're on parole,
you are only what I see.

06:14.216 --> 06:17.883
Now, I'd lock the doors if I was you.

06:18.008 --> 06:21.216
There's burglars and thieves
around these parts.

06:47.091 --> 06:50.758
- I bet you thought I wasn't gonna make it.
- Yeah. I wasn't sure that I was.

06:50.883 --> 06:54.091
That's right, you've only had 12 hours to
change. You should've started last night.

06:54.216 --> 06:56.841
"Ha ha," she said gamely.

06:56.966 --> 06:59.591
Well, two of our trustees
are gonna be at the Thomasons'.

06:59.716 --> 07:02.133
- Do I have to be charming?
- No, just be yourself.

07:02.258 --> 07:06.174
Actually, you need to be a little charming.
Just nod and smile and talk to the wives.

07:06.299 --> 07:09.758
It's the Thomasons. Dorothy will be there.
You can gossip behind our backs.

07:09.883 --> 07:13.424
I promise to turn my back
as often as possible.

07:13.549 --> 07:15.966
Is that what you're wearing?

07:23.799 --> 07:27.591
Let's go double or nothin'!
I'll spot you three balls this time.

07:27.716 --> 07:28.924
All tapped out, buddy.

07:29.049 --> 07:32.133
Come on. Don't be a pussy. I know you got
some green right there in that pocket.

07:32.258 --> 07:34.383
- No. I'm good.
- Hey.

07:34.508 --> 07:37.383
You walk out on a man who's still gamblin',
you might catch a bad one.

07:37.508 --> 07:40.299
You startin' fights again, Dill?

07:41.383 --> 07:44.758
Why don't you rack 'em up, big guy?
I'll be happy to take Dill's cash off you.

07:44.883 --> 07:47.674
Come on, man. Let me buy you a beer.

07:47.799 --> 07:51.966
- So what you been working on, man?
- Just dirty cars, mostly.

07:52.091 --> 07:54.966
Yeah? That sounds shitty.

07:55.091 --> 08:00.299
Better work's comin'. I know a lot of
businesses going belly up in this economy.

08:02.383 --> 08:05.841
Tons of shit just sittin' there
just waitin' to be picked.

08:06.341 --> 08:07.924
I know you could use the money.

08:08.049 --> 08:10.549
Especially if you ever want
to play pool again.

08:10.674 --> 08:12.258
Ain't exactly flush.

08:12.424 --> 08:16.883
Well, hell, let's change that. Can I get
a beer here for my poor relation?

08:19.633 --> 08:22.341
We'll be seeing you.

08:22.633 --> 08:25.341
You know, if Giddons finds out
that you and Bo have been chattin',

08:25.466 --> 08:30.133
- he's gonna send you right back up.
- Yeah, he probably will anyway.

08:33.466 --> 08:35.799
- With authority!
- How does that feel?

08:42.716 --> 08:45.049
- Porters!
- Hey.

08:45.174 --> 08:47.424
Hi. How are you?

08:54.091 --> 08:56.841
- Personally, I think you're a shoe-in.
- I don't know, guys.

08:56.966 --> 08:59.966
The city council would be a good step,
but I still have a hospital to run.

09:00.091 --> 09:04.341
- I'm not sure I'm ready to move on.
- Methinks the man doth protest too much.

09:04.466 --> 09:07.674
Not at all. He's still got four months
of protesting ahead of him.

09:07.799 --> 09:10.132
Wait until we start begging
before you announce.

09:10.299 --> 09:13.632
- Please don't ever start begging.
- ...a rumor. It's an undeniable truth.

09:13.757 --> 09:16.257
- It might as well be written in print.
- What's true?

09:16.382 --> 09:19.007
Chief Booth is having a thing.
He's taking lovers.

09:19.132 --> 09:23.591
- Just one, sweetie.
- Paula Dodd? Is she that... she's that...

09:23.716 --> 09:26.591
She runs that gift shop,
sells those ceramic things.

09:26.716 --> 09:28.757
- Yes, thank you.
- She's good.

09:28.882 --> 09:32.716
- Someone should tell Audrey Booth.
- She would absolutely crucify him.

09:32.841 --> 09:36.841
She has a right to know if her husband's
cheating on her. That's all I'm saying.

09:44.007 --> 09:48.091
- Hey, Dylan.
- Hey, Donna. How are you?

09:48.799 --> 09:51.674
- You gonna buy me a drink?
- Yeah.

09:52.091 --> 09:55.091
Damn, I'm all cleaned out right now.

09:55.216 --> 09:58.049
I mean I would. You can have mine.

09:59.591 --> 10:01.716
That's okay. I don't want your cooties.

10:01.841 --> 10:07.424
No, no. I've been to a specialist about that
and they turned out to be benign cooties.

10:07.549 --> 10:09.341
So...

10:09.757 --> 10:13.382
- Wait, what?
- Nothin', it's just a...

10:14.382 --> 10:19.716
- So, what's been going on with you?
- Just, you know, the usual.

10:21.674 --> 10:26.091
- Hey, you working?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm over at the...

10:27.299 --> 10:29.674
National Car Wash, still.

10:29.799 --> 10:33.382
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

10:35.091 --> 10:36.924
Okay.

10:40.799 --> 10:43.091
- Well, I'll see you...
- Okay, let's just talk later.

10:43.216 --> 10:45.549
- Okay. All right
- I'll see you around. Okay.

10:45.674 --> 10:47.299
Good talking to you.

10:47.924 --> 10:49.841
Hey, Eddie.

10:56.382 --> 10:57.716
Yeah!

11:01.549 --> 11:03.591
No, it's the best thing
in the world, really.

11:03.716 --> 11:05.757
I only took the class
because Dorothy was taking it.

11:05.882 --> 11:08.966
- And for the naked men.
- And for the naked men, of course.

11:09.091 --> 11:13.299
But now it's really an obsession.
The drawing, I mean.

11:14.549 --> 11:17.174
What about you, Becky?
Do you ever think about taking classes?

11:17.299 --> 11:21.591
I've wanted to take a painting class
for a while, but I'm really no good.

11:21.716 --> 11:24.799
You're not out to make a living, sweetie!
Drawing would be good for you.

11:24.924 --> 11:28.216
It clears out the cobwebs.
Not that you have got any cobwebs.

11:29.424 --> 11:34.007
I had a streak, boy! You walked away
when I was on a streak! I had a streak!

11:35.257 --> 11:38.091
Hey, you boys keep it light now.

11:38.216 --> 11:40.924
Let's go talk. Come on! Outside, come on!

11:41.049 --> 11:43.299
- You all right?
- Yeah, I didn't even see him comin'.

11:43.424 --> 11:45.924
Well, he knocked the living piss
out of you, man.

11:46.049 --> 11:48.424
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

11:48.549 --> 11:51.799
Let me pull you a beer
on the house, how about it?

11:53.216 --> 11:56.007
I'll pass, Wayne, thanks.

11:59.716 --> 12:01.549
Rebecca!

12:02.257 --> 12:06.591
- Is she okay?
- I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm fine.

12:06.716 --> 12:08.215
Oh, my God.

12:12.632 --> 12:15.049
Yeah, hit him again.

12:16.632 --> 12:18.632
You made your point, guys.

12:21.549 --> 12:23.632
You're welcome.

12:47.840 --> 12:51.882
Give me a little warning next time
you're gonna have another seizure, okay?

12:52.924 --> 12:56.632
- I mean, honey, it really was quite a show.
- It was a muscle spasm.

12:56.757 --> 12:58.799
I guess.

12:59.215 --> 13:01.257
It hurt a lot.

13:01.382 --> 13:05.382
For a second, I...
felt like somebody hit me.

13:05.507 --> 13:09.340
The look on your face, Becky,
was a little much, you know?

13:09.465 --> 13:13.549
Even for someone with a muscle spasm.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.590
I guess for a second I was worried
this was the beginning of another...

13:21.715 --> 13:23.132
It's not.

13:24.549 --> 13:26.632
It's not.

13:27.424 --> 13:29.215
Okay.

13:29.340 --> 13:32.174
I'll give you a shoulder rub
when we get home.

13:33.174 --> 13:35.882
It doesn't hurt anymore.

13:47.132 --> 13:52.757
<i>In our days we will live</i>

13:52.882 --> 13:56.590
<i>Like our ghosts will live</i>

13:56.715 --> 14:02.590
<i>Pitching glass at the cornfield crows</i>

14:02.715 --> 14:05.757
<i>And foldin' clothes</i>

14:05.882 --> 14:11.632
<i>And we'll undress beside
the ashes of the fire</i>

14:12.715 --> 14:18.507
<i>Both our tender bellies
wound in bailing wire</i>

14:18.882 --> 14:25.090
<i>All the more a pair of underwater pearls</i>

14:25.215 --> 14:31.965
<i>Than the oak tree
and its resurrection fern</i>

14:41.965 --> 14:47.882
<i>We'll undress beside the ashes of the fire</i>

14:48.007 --> 14:53.965
<i>Our tender bellies
are wound around in bailing wire</i>

14:54.549 --> 15:00.007
<i>All the more a pair of underwater pearls</i>

15:00.924 --> 15:07.715
<i>Than the oak tree
and its resurrection fern.</i>

15:49.382 --> 15:51.257
- Hello?
- <i>Where are you, asshole?</i>

15:51.382 --> 15:55.048
What? What time is it? Oh, shit!

15:58.548 --> 16:01.632
<i>When we were younger we thought
everyone was in our side</i>

16:01.757 --> 16:04.048
- Shit!
- <i>Then we grew a little</i>

16:04.173 --> 16:07.548
<i>And romanticized the time I saw</i>

16:07.673 --> 16:11.048
<i>Flowers in your hair</i>

16:12.715 --> 16:17.382
<i>It takes a boy to live
It takes a man to pretend he was there</i>

16:19.882 --> 16:22.423
<i>Be in my eyes</i>

16:23.757 --> 16:26.298
<i>Be in my heart</i>

16:27.382 --> 16:29.257
<i>Be in my eyes</i>

16:29.382 --> 16:33.465
<i>Ay, ay, ay, be in my heart</i>

16:36.090 --> 16:39.798
<i>So now I think that I could love you back</i>

16:39.923 --> 16:42.882
<i>And I hope it's not too late
'cause you're so attractive</i>

16:43.007 --> 16:47.590
<i>And the way you move I won't close my eyes</i>

16:48.215 --> 16:50.673
<i>Be in my eyes</i>

16:51.882 --> 16:54.590
<i>Be in my heart</i>

16:57.132 --> 17:00.007
- Hello.
- Hi.

17:00.382 --> 17:05.339
- Anything in particular?
- No, I'm just stocking up.

17:14.714 --> 17:17.257
<i>Be in my eyes</i>

17:18.507 --> 17:21.048
<i>Be in my heart</i>

17:44.340 --> 17:47.007
- Look out!
- Oh, fuck!

17:47.757 --> 17:50.590
- Fuck!
- What?

17:50.715 --> 17:53.173
What? What?

17:53.298 --> 17:56.923
- Who is that?
- Who said that?

17:57.340 --> 17:59.257
- Stop it.
- Ma'am?

17:59.382 --> 18:01.340
Who said that?

18:01.465 --> 18:03.757
Stop this! Stop this! Stop it.

18:03.882 --> 18:06.340
Ma'am, your bag!

18:07.132 --> 18:09.340
Oh, shit.

18:11.173 --> 18:15.965
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

18:16.548 --> 18:19.632
- Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.
- What is this? What's going on?

18:19.757 --> 18:23.798
- Stop it. Stop this. Stop it.
- Hey, shut up!

18:27.590 --> 18:31.673
- Can you hear me? Who are you?
- I'm sorry.

18:31.798 --> 18:33.382
I'm sorry? What am I sorry about?
What did I do?

18:33.507 --> 18:35.965
- Who are you?
- I asked you that.

18:38.757 --> 18:42.757
I'm looking at a store window.
Am I looking at a store window?

18:42.882 --> 18:44.632
Yes. I am.

18:45.590 --> 18:50.090
- Is... are you me?
- No. No, no, no! You're in my head.

18:50.215 --> 18:54.090
You're in my head. I'm having...

18:54.798 --> 18:58.590
I'm losing... Oh, God. I'm so scared.

18:58.715 --> 19:00.632
- Where am I?
- What?

19:00.757 --> 19:02.632
Where am I?

19:02.757 --> 19:06.673
You're on the road.
You're on a road. There's a truck.

19:06.798 --> 19:10.173
I don't understand.
What does the truck mean?

19:10.298 --> 19:12.590
Well, that means I have a truck.

19:13.090 --> 19:14.423
It's my truck.

19:15.340 --> 19:17.673
I have a truck.

19:19.631 --> 19:22.715
- You have a truck.
- Yeah.

19:22.840 --> 19:25.090
- Why, what do you have?
- What?

19:26.881 --> 19:30.798
- A Range Rover.
- Nice. Safe.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.048
I can see out there.

19:37.590 --> 19:40.881
I can see here, too.

19:41.298 --> 19:44.923
It's like one's close and one's far away.

19:45.048 --> 19:47.590
I just focus and...

19:47.715 --> 19:50.340
I can see what's here

19:50.465 --> 19:52.256
or what's in my head.

19:52.381 --> 19:55.298
This ain't your head, lady.
This is New Mexico.

19:56.673 --> 19:59.423
Wait, you're real.

20:00.006 --> 20:02.340
You're a real person.

20:02.465 --> 20:05.381
That's the sweetest thing
anybody's said to me all day.

20:06.381 --> 20:08.923
I don't understand this.

20:11.548 --> 20:15.590
It's cold. Wait, are you cold there?

20:16.298 --> 20:18.715
Yeah, it's... it's almost winter.

20:20.048 --> 20:23.715
I can feel it. This is too crazy.
And I can hear you like...

20:23.840 --> 20:25.965
Like I hear myself.

20:28.715 --> 20:31.756
Where are you? If you're not
in my head, then where are you?

20:32.965 --> 20:36.756
- Exeter, New Hampshire.
- New Hampshire?

20:36.881 --> 20:38.423
Get outta here.

20:38.548 --> 20:42.590
Wait a minute. What time is it?
You know, what day?

20:42.965 --> 20:45.673
It's Thursday, the...

20:46.090 --> 20:47.923
24th.

20:48.048 --> 20:50.965
Okay, well, that's today I think.
Do you have a watch?

20:51.256 --> 20:53.048
Yeah.

20:55.465 --> 20:57.631
Oh, my God.

20:57.756 --> 21:01.006
You're in the future.
You're two hours in the future!

21:01.131 --> 21:04.881
No... I'm in a different time zone.

21:05.923 --> 21:07.673
Yeah, right.

21:09.215 --> 21:11.756
Can you hear my thoughts?

21:11.881 --> 21:13.798
I don't know. Think something.

21:14.756 --> 21:16.631
Okay.

21:16.756 --> 21:19.756
- What should I think about?
- I'm not allowed to tell you.

21:19.881 --> 21:21.756
Right.

21:22.131 --> 21:23.923
Okay.

21:26.798 --> 21:30.756
- Yeah, no. I got nothin'.
- I'm thinking about new sneakers.

21:30.881 --> 21:33.840
Okay, that's a weird one.

21:33.965 --> 21:36.673
- All right. Well, what if we just both...
- Rebecca, you all right?

21:36.965 --> 21:40.048
Hello? You there?

21:41.423 --> 21:44.090
Hi, Chief Booth.

21:44.215 --> 21:47.506
- You okay?
- Yes. I'm fine.

21:47.631 --> 21:49.298
I'm so sorry. I think I fell.

21:49.423 --> 21:51.090
- I think I'm...
- Did you hurt yourself?

21:51.215 --> 21:56.465
No, I think maybe I had...
bad clams or something.

21:57.173 --> 22:00.048
Are you... how are you? How's Audrey?

22:00.173 --> 22:02.048
Good. She's great.
Are you sure you're all right?

22:02.173 --> 22:05.840
Yeah, I'm great. I'm great.

22:05.965 --> 22:10.090
Maybe if you just... walk me
to my car to be sure.

22:10.215 --> 22:12.048
- Absolutely. Where are you?
- You know...

22:12.173 --> 22:13.965
I think I'm parked right over here.

22:14.090 --> 22:16.506
- You sure you're okay?
- I'm totally fine.

22:21.381 --> 22:23.340
Are you there?

22:26.215 --> 22:30.590
- Guess we got disconnected.
- Yeah, someone came. I had to cut you off.

22:30.715 --> 22:32.423
So, wait. How?

22:32.548 --> 22:35.090
I mean, I could feel you
trying to come in,

22:35.215 --> 22:38.339
this kind of swimmy feeling
in the back of my head.

22:38.464 --> 22:41.048
But I could stop it.

22:41.173 --> 22:44.798
- That's good to know.
- Yeah.

22:46.214 --> 22:49.756
I can't talk here.
People are staring at me.

22:49.881 --> 22:53.381
Right, and assuming I still got a job,
I need to get to it. But...

22:53.506 --> 22:58.131
- I mean, we gotta talk about all this.
- Okay. Later, though.

22:58.714 --> 22:59.923
7:00?

23:00.048 --> 23:03.756
Okay. Well, wait, that's 5:00
my time. I'm still at work.

23:03.881 --> 23:07.256
- Say 10:00? 8:00 for me?
- Yeah, great. Fine, okay.

23:07.381 --> 23:12.964
Okay. And if... you know, it doesn't
work for some reason, then...

23:13.839 --> 23:17.256
It was nice meeting you.

23:19.631 --> 23:22.964
Hey, it's snowing.

23:49.714 --> 23:52.089
Hey, hey, hey!

23:52.673 --> 23:54.714
On top!

24:23.506 --> 24:28.006
- Oh, my God, it's almost 10:00.
- Why, yes, it is.

24:28.131 --> 24:30.214
Is that... is that some cause
for excitement?

24:30.339 --> 24:33.464
No, no, no, no. It's just we ate so late.

24:33.589 --> 24:38.381
- I told you it was gonna be a long day.
- I know. No, I was just... I just meant...

24:38.881 --> 24:41.423
I just meant you must be tired
and thinking about going to bed.

24:41.548 --> 24:44.131
Well, I'm not. Is that okay?

24:44.256 --> 24:47.548
- Of course.
- Good.

25:00.464 --> 25:02.006
Actually...

25:02.131 --> 25:06.881
- there was a show I wanted to... to watch.
- Yeah, that sounds fun for you.

25:26.548 --> 25:29.006
Oh, my God!

25:30.839 --> 25:33.006
Well. Yeah, hi.

25:34.214 --> 25:36.964
Oh, boy. I did not expect this to work.

25:37.089 --> 25:39.589
- I thought I was just...
- I know, I did, too.

25:39.714 --> 25:43.548
Oh, man. Okay. Well...

25:43.673 --> 25:47.214
I spent all day just trying to think
why this could be happening.

25:47.339 --> 25:49.923
So, did you come up with anything?

25:50.048 --> 25:52.756
Well, you know, one thing did occur to me.

25:52.881 --> 25:56.506
Are you just by any chance...

25:56.631 --> 25:58.423
Satan?

25:58.548 --> 26:00.381
No.

26:02.256 --> 26:04.423
My name is Rebecca.

26:04.798 --> 26:08.714
That's... I didn't even think of that.
I'm Dylan.

26:09.214 --> 26:11.964
Dylan. That's nice.

26:14.672 --> 26:18.172
This is a nice room. Is this your place?

26:18.297 --> 26:21.631
Yeah, this is my house.
I mean, it's my husband's.

26:21.922 --> 26:24.089
You're... you're married.

26:24.506 --> 26:28.131
Yeah, why not? I mean, you got a name.
You could be married, too.

26:28.256 --> 26:30.547
Did you tell him about it?

26:33.047 --> 26:35.422
No. I...

26:36.631 --> 26:38.422
I just wasn't sure.

26:38.547 --> 26:42.256
Yeah, I mean... maybe it's better
if you don't right away.

26:43.381 --> 26:46.506
I don't know. This is hard enough
to believe if it's happening to you.

26:46.631 --> 26:50.339
Yeah. I'm gonna wait.

26:51.506 --> 26:53.089
Wait.

26:53.381 --> 26:56.089
So this is your house?

26:56.214 --> 27:01.089
No. It's... yeah, yeah.
It is, but it's a little messy.

27:01.214 --> 27:04.339
It's kind of the maid's decade off.

27:12.547 --> 27:15.756
- Wait, what are you doing?
- It's better this way.

27:16.381 --> 27:18.256
You shouldn't have to...

27:18.964 --> 27:23.631
- I don't really have girls over too much.
- Oh, my God. I have to ask you.

27:24.381 --> 27:26.631
Did you...

27:27.047 --> 27:31.047
did you get hit last night on the shoulder,
like... like, really hard?

27:31.172 --> 27:34.297
Yeah, sure did. Yeah, son of a bitch
just came at me...

27:34.422 --> 27:37.589
With a pool cue! I know. I was there!

27:38.214 --> 27:42.172
And I was also at this dinner party.

27:49.922 --> 27:53.297
- ...trying to fend him off!
- Becky?

27:56.089 --> 27:58.756
Hi. Sorry, it's Vicki Madden.

27:58.881 --> 28:02.756
I was just telling her
about my smooth move last night.

28:02.881 --> 28:07.381
- You must tell it really well.
- Yeah, what was that?

28:07.506 --> 28:10.422
Oh, God, yes. The kids sound amazing.

28:11.131 --> 28:13.006
I can't believe that.

28:13.797 --> 28:17.964
- That was very smooth.
- Thank you, Vicky.

28:20.547 --> 28:24.214
- So that was your husband?
- Oh, yeah.

28:25.047 --> 28:27.256
Yeah, that's Phillip.

28:27.381 --> 28:29.339
- Good-looking guy.
- Yeah.

28:29.464 --> 28:33.964
Doctor. He runs the hospital here.

28:34.547 --> 28:36.547
Professional man.

28:36.672 --> 28:38.464
Yeah.

28:40.381 --> 28:42.631
I should probably go.

28:42.756 --> 28:45.589
Do you want to talk again tomorrow?

28:47.047 --> 28:50.464
Okay, but after Phillip goes to work.

28:50.881 --> 28:53.631
You're not, like, planning on
getting hit again, are you?

28:53.756 --> 28:56.839
Well, let's see. It's not in my book.

28:56.964 --> 28:59.922
That wasn't nothin' anyway.
Worst I ever took was...

29:01.714 --> 29:03.881
Oh, my God.

29:04.756 --> 29:05.881
What?

29:06.006 --> 29:08.547
Let me ask you something.
Did you ever go sledding?

29:08.672 --> 29:12.464
Did you ever go sledding
and get really hurt?

29:13.506 --> 29:17.297
- I hit a tree.
- Jesus H. God!

29:18.089 --> 29:19.881
I got knocked out cold.

29:20.464 --> 29:23.547
I mean, I must have been out
for more than a minute.

29:24.089 --> 29:26.631
I still have the scar.

29:27.714 --> 29:30.631
Dylan, that was 20 years ago.

29:31.422 --> 29:33.964
I'll be damned.

30:05.755 --> 30:07.797
I got 12 stitches,

30:07.922 --> 30:12.672
and my mom never let me go sledding again.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.714
Not that I was all that keen to.

30:16.214 --> 30:18.339
Hey, what about when you were, like,

30:18.464 --> 30:22.964
I don't know, maybe 16. I mean,
you were all torn up about something.

30:23.130 --> 30:24.880
I wanna say it was, like,
the dead of summer.

30:25.005 --> 30:28.755
And it must have been a killer, because
I must have been crossed out for a month.

30:28.880 --> 30:31.297
That is so embarrassing.

30:32.047 --> 30:35.880
- What?
- I can't tell you. It's too personal.

30:36.005 --> 30:39.714
Come on! You got to!
You owe me a whole July.

30:40.964 --> 30:43.297
That was...

30:44.005 --> 30:46.839
Walter, my first boyfriend.

30:47.422 --> 30:50.755
I was so in love with him.
He was 20, you know?

30:51.380 --> 30:55.922
I don't know, we went out for two months
then he broke up with me right after we...

30:56.047 --> 30:57.922
you know.

30:59.589 --> 31:01.714
- No wonder.
- Yeah.

31:01.839 --> 31:04.547
I mean, like, right after.

31:05.589 --> 31:10.714
- What a dick.
- Sorry if I... ruined your summer.

31:11.339 --> 31:13.172
No, it's cool.

31:13.297 --> 31:18.922
I was pretty used to having weird moods
and stuff I couldn't really explain.

31:19.047 --> 31:22.922
Yeah, me, too. I pretty much thought
that you were PMS.

31:23.047 --> 31:25.880
Yeah, a lot of people get us mixed up.

31:27.089 --> 31:29.880
I remember some other stuff, too. But...

31:30.005 --> 31:32.922
I don't know,
I guess it's all kind of personal.

31:33.047 --> 31:35.422
Like, your mom.

31:35.547 --> 31:37.630
Yeah, that figures.

31:37.755 --> 31:41.630
- You were in college, right?
- Yeah.

31:42.339 --> 31:46.172
She wasn't ever very well. She was...

31:46.297 --> 31:48.797
like me, kind of.

31:49.130 --> 31:52.130
I'm not much of a physical specimen.

31:53.130 --> 31:55.880
Dylan, there's something...

31:56.005 --> 31:57.755
it didn't make
any sense to me at the time,

31:57.880 --> 32:01.297
but, you know, I always felt
like there was someone with me.

32:01.422 --> 32:03.797
You know, just like a feeling.

32:03.922 --> 32:08.797
I felt it... more strongly
than ever after she died.

32:09.505 --> 32:10.672
It helped.

32:11.714 --> 32:14.422
Did you ever feel that way?

32:14.547 --> 32:16.714
Why don't you tell me?

32:16.922 --> 32:20.755
I remember your first night in prison.

32:22.255 --> 32:25.797
Yeah. Right. Time to come clean.

32:27.505 --> 32:29.880
- What did you do?
- I just...

32:31.297 --> 32:35.297
good with locks.
Not that good with silent alarms.

32:36.214 --> 32:40.589
Got two years. In with mostly lifers.

32:42.047 --> 32:46.047
Yeah, I figured that was nightmares.
It was really terrifying.

32:46.172 --> 32:51.422
Yeah. Yeah, I never felt as alone
as I did in there, doing my bid.

32:52.672 --> 32:54.172
You weren't.

32:57.464 --> 33:00.089
Hey! Jesus, hey.

33:00.214 --> 33:02.464
- What?
- Go look in the mirror.

33:04.047 --> 33:06.088
- What?
- Come on!

33:06.213 --> 33:09.547
I don't even hardly know what you
look like, except mostly your hands.

33:11.047 --> 33:13.297
Go on, show me!

33:13.422 --> 33:16.088
I... you know, why don't you do that?

33:16.213 --> 33:19.005
'Cause... I asked first.

33:19.130 --> 33:23.088
Well... I'm not doing it
unless you do it, too.

33:23.213 --> 33:25.630
Okay, but after you.

33:26.047 --> 33:27.422
I'm not even dressed.

33:27.547 --> 33:31.338
Well, come on. Who's fault is that,
lazy bones? Let's go.

33:33.380 --> 33:34.797
Fine.

33:42.755 --> 33:44.422
This is ridiculous. I'm scared.

33:44.547 --> 33:48.005
- Come on. What have you got to be scared of?
- Shut up. You're scared, too!

33:48.505 --> 33:50.380
Okay.

33:51.130 --> 33:53.713
I'm going to the mirror, now.

34:13.380 --> 34:16.880
- God, I'm beautiful.
- Don't be stupid.

34:17.005 --> 34:22.130
Yeah, no. When I said beautiful, I meant
ugly. Wart-covered, right? What did I say?

34:22.255 --> 34:25.213
Just don't flatter me because
I spent the night in prison with you.

34:25.338 --> 34:29.505
What are you talking about? Look, I was
having fun being a beautiful girl there.

34:29.630 --> 34:33.255
I was all ready to go buy hats
or something. Go back.

34:33.380 --> 34:35.755
No. No, it's your turn.

34:36.088 --> 34:38.755
Hold on. Just give me a second.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.588
It's your turn.

34:47.130 --> 34:49.463
Read 'em and weep.

34:53.213 --> 34:54.963
You've got such a nice face.

34:56.380 --> 35:00.005
- Nice?
- No.

35:01.963 --> 35:03.797
I mean, yeah, it is.

35:03.922 --> 35:08.255
It ain't much, but it does cover
my unsightly skull. So that's a plus.

35:18.547 --> 35:21.838
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:29.838 --> 35:33.755
No, no. No, it was nothing
like that. We...

35:34.880 --> 35:39.755
we actually met when he...
when he lectured at my school.

35:40.630 --> 35:44.880
I know, it sounds terrible,
but it was really nice.

35:45.005 --> 35:47.422
- We just got along great, and...
- What did you say?

35:47.547 --> 35:50.172
Nothing, I was... the phone.

35:50.297 --> 35:54.963
Did you figure it out? I wish I could
describe it better. It was a chugging noise.

35:55.088 --> 35:59.338
Yeah, I know. What it is, is you got a crack
in your manifold. They go on you.

35:59.463 --> 36:03.713
You need to replace it. Let me check
my stock, and probably rack you up today?

36:03.838 --> 36:06.588
- Yeah, that's great. Thank you.
- Excellent.

36:06.713 --> 36:08.880
What year is your truck?

36:09.505 --> 36:10.797
A 2010.

36:10.922 --> 36:14.297
There's no way the exhaust system on a Range
Rover would go after just a few years.

36:14.713 --> 36:16.422
Here, turn her over.

36:18.380 --> 36:23.088
- Okay, now go look under the hood.
- Like, what, now?

36:23.213 --> 36:27.047
No, after he charges you $1,200 bucks.
Yeah, come on.

36:35.255 --> 36:37.130
Okay.

36:37.796 --> 36:40.171
What am I looking at?

36:41.838 --> 36:45.296
Okay. That sounds like it could
just be the sensor got loose,

36:45.421 --> 36:49.921
- so that should be over by the AVS.
- I don't know what that is.

36:50.046 --> 36:53.505
That... that boxy thing there.

36:53.630 --> 36:56.213
Okay, over here?

36:57.005 --> 36:59.463
No. Okay, try the other side.

36:59.588 --> 37:03.963
- Over here?
- It's, like, a multi-prong thing.

37:04.088 --> 37:08.046
You're looking for like a multi-prong
plug-in thing. See that?

37:08.171 --> 37:12.296
- Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
- What do I do with it?

37:12.421 --> 37:15.796
There, look, it's loose! Plug it in.
There's your problem, right there.

37:17.296 --> 37:19.255
- The sound stopped!
- Yup.

37:19.380 --> 37:21.213
- That's it?
- That's it.

37:21.338 --> 37:23.963
- I fixed it!
- Yes, you did, darling.

37:25.005 --> 37:27.338
- We're in luck. I can take you today.
- We are in luck.

37:27.463 --> 37:31.963
The intake and exhaust manifolds
were both fine. The...

37:32.088 --> 37:34.796
- Sensor.
- Sensor just needed tightening.

37:34.921 --> 37:37.171
I don't think that's gonna do you
much good in the long run, but...

37:37.296 --> 37:41.005
- yeah, I can take care of it for you.
- No, that's all right. I already did it.

37:41.130 --> 37:43.338
Thanks, Dan!

37:44.421 --> 37:47.005
And they put me in prison.

37:55.380 --> 37:59.713
<i>I've been looking for a fight</i>

37:59.838 --> 38:03.713
<i>All the trouble that I know</i>

38:03.838 --> 38:07.838
<i>Trying to lose the world inside</i>

38:07.963 --> 38:11.880
<i>But it's got no place to go</i>

38:13.421 --> 38:16.755
<i>Oh, I'm armed and dangerous</i>

38:16.880 --> 38:20.755
<i>And I'm deafened by the fray</i>

38:20.880 --> 38:23.546
<i>Waiting for the day...</i>

38:23.671 --> 38:24.921
What is that?

38:25.046 --> 38:28.421
<i>And I set it on this way</i>

38:28.546 --> 38:33.005
<i>Oh, take me home</i>

38:33.130 --> 38:35.921
<i>Let me go all day</i>

38:36.046 --> 38:38.588
<i>Just be here till I know</i>

38:38.713 --> 38:44.255
<i>Till I know that the riot's gone</i>

38:44.380 --> 38:48.588
<i>The riot's gone away</i>

39:03.880 --> 39:07.046
<i>Turn it up, turn it up,
gonna get fucked up</i>

39:07.171 --> 39:12.213
<i>I wanna make up now for all the things
I said that I can't control</i>

39:12.338 --> 39:14.880
<i>Cut it out, cut it out when it doesn't go</i>

39:15.005 --> 39:17.421
<i>So one day we wake up</i>

39:17.546 --> 39:20.380
<i>So while we wish to go
we can zip and go now</i>

39:20.505 --> 39:23.505
<i>Oh, take me home</i>

39:23.630 --> 39:26.380
<i>Let me go all day</i>

39:26.505 --> 39:29.046
<i>Just be there till I know</i>

39:29.171 --> 39:34.546
<i>Till I know that the riot's gone</i>

39:34.671 --> 39:37.338
<i>The riot's gone away</i>

39:37.463 --> 39:41.463
<i>Hey, I heard it for a moment now</i>

39:41.588 --> 39:45.755
<i>Hey, I hear you coming and be quiet</i>

39:45.880 --> 39:49.338
<i>Hey, I heard it for a moment</i>

39:49.463 --> 39:54.546
<i>Now the riot's gone, the riot's gone</i>

39:58.421 --> 40:03.088
Kershaw, so how's the auto
cleansing business treating you?

40:03.213 --> 40:05.671
Actually, I've been thinking about
looking for some new work.

40:05.796 --> 40:07.504
Who with? Bo? Lyle?

40:07.629 --> 40:09.504
I wanna see if I can't scare up
something better.

40:09.629 --> 40:13.504
I ain't gonna quit or nothin'
until I'm sure, but...

40:15.421 --> 40:18.379
What's with you? You got a funny look.

40:18.504 --> 40:21.171
- What?
- You look like you're about to kiss me.

40:21.296 --> 40:25.338
Well, I mean, when the light hits you
like that, something about your head...

40:25.463 --> 40:29.129
Well, solicitation is a crime,
so what's going on, Kershaw?

40:29.254 --> 40:31.338
Nothing's going on!

40:32.338 --> 40:35.588
For such a smart man,
you are a piss poor liar.

40:41.629 --> 40:43.921
I met someone.

40:46.296 --> 40:49.004
Well, there it is. Yeah.

40:49.129 --> 40:52.879
You're getting your pecker waxed?
She know you a con?

40:53.004 --> 40:57.713
- She doesn't seem to mind.
- You got you one of them classy women.

40:57.838 --> 41:02.296
- You'd be surprised.
- Nothing you do could surprise me.

41:06.129 --> 41:08.129
Over there.

41:15.463 --> 41:17.463
I like that you told him
you had a girlfriend.

41:17.588 --> 41:19.671
Yeah, well, some people
will believe anything.

41:19.796 --> 41:23.963
- Come on, you've had girlfriends.
- Nothing that lasted more than a few dates.

41:24.629 --> 41:26.338
I'm just not good with women.

41:27.879 --> 41:32.838
- What about your man needs?
- Becky! You got a mind like a sewer.

41:35.379 --> 41:37.296
Shoot.

41:37.421 --> 41:40.004
Just move the other six back
and then you can move that one over.

41:40.129 --> 41:44.171
- No, dummy, that's cheating.
- It's not cheating. It's creative.

41:44.296 --> 41:47.338
It's no fun to cheat.
It's no fun if you win.

41:47.463 --> 41:50.921
Only reason you don't cheat is 'cause
you're afraid someone will get mad.

41:51.129 --> 41:56.046
- Can't always do what you're told, darling.
- Spoken like a true convict.

42:00.129 --> 42:03.963
- I'm sorry.
- What? No, no. Yeah, it's okay.

42:05.046 --> 42:08.254
I got no right to be touchy.
It's all true.

42:12.963 --> 42:14.754
Hey.

42:15.254 --> 42:20.338
I think I figured it out. Why it happened
or why we opened it up when we did.

42:20.463 --> 42:21.796
- Really?
- Really.

42:21.921 --> 42:24.463
- Why?
- Why not?

42:31.338 --> 42:33.796
What up, Dill Pickle?

42:36.963 --> 42:39.463
I gotta go, Becky.
Got something I gotta do.

42:39.588 --> 42:42.004
Okay, I'll see you.

42:45.963 --> 42:48.921
Grumman Tech Supply.
The bitch is ripe, Dylan.

42:49.046 --> 42:50.921
- Is it?
- You know our cousin Adam...

42:51.046 --> 42:54.004
the one who beat that aggravated assault
charge against that 7-Eleven clerk?

42:54.129 --> 42:56.296
Kicked his lard ass all up and down
the freezer section.

42:56.421 --> 42:58.338
He's been working maintenance
in the office park.

42:58.463 --> 43:02.046
He says Grumman is empty as church service
on a Super Bowl Sunday.

43:02.171 --> 43:03.921
Here's the best part...

43:04.046 --> 43:06.879
- no silent alarms.
- Don't it just make your heart sing?

43:07.004 --> 43:10.004
I don't know. You know Giddons is just
drooling for me to make a move like this.

43:10.129 --> 43:13.379
Don't worry about Giddons. He'll sleep
through it. Your end is two hours at most.

43:13.504 --> 43:16.463
You open up the pearly gates,
we handle the rest.

43:16.588 --> 43:19.088
You don't want to be seen with us.
Yeah, I get it. I get it, man.

43:19.213 --> 43:22.004
Hell, we'll mail you your cut.

43:22.129 --> 43:23.671
I could use some walking around money.

43:23.796 --> 43:27.629
This is more than just walking around money.
We got a fence lined up in Wilburfield.

43:27.754 --> 43:29.754
He's gonna buy the whole lot.

43:29.879 --> 43:33.963
Your parole gets through,
this is you setting up in a new town.

43:34.088 --> 43:36.129
Like a proper man.

43:36.254 --> 43:40.296
All you gotta do is keep
your pretty trap shut, Dill Pickle.

43:40.421 --> 43:42.879
Who's ever gonna know?

43:48.171 --> 43:52.212
I don't know. I just...
ain't exactly good timing for me.

43:52.337 --> 43:55.254
What else are you gonna do, man?
You just gonna wax a bunch of Caddies?

43:55.379 --> 43:57.337
Dylan, this was your idea.

43:57.462 --> 44:01.004
When you got out, you asked for some action,
something to get back on your feet,

44:01.129 --> 44:04.504
something safe, now, this is
way the hell out in Bedlow.

44:04.629 --> 44:08.462
And all that equipment's just sitting there.
It ain't nobody's. It's gonna rust.

44:08.587 --> 44:11.462
- There's no victim here.
- Yeah, just a true convict.

44:11.587 --> 44:14.671
Dylan, we let you in on this
because you asked.

44:14.796 --> 44:18.796
Now, I don't like you knowing
if you don't have a stake in it.

44:21.962 --> 44:24.712
We'll be waiting on you, boy.

44:27.254 --> 44:29.754
Catch you soon, Dill Pickle.

45:05.796 --> 45:08.254
- Hey.
- Phillip.

45:08.379 --> 45:11.004
- You startled me.
- Sorry.

45:11.129 --> 45:12.962
You know how I get in these places.

45:13.087 --> 45:16.796
Yeah, I do, which is why I'm surprised
to see you here. Is everything all right?

45:16.921 --> 45:18.671
Yeah, everything's fine.

45:18.796 --> 45:23.629
I was around and I had a wild notion
you might be free for lunch.

45:24.879 --> 45:26.671
It was a pretty wild notion.

45:26.796 --> 45:30.546
Look, I've still got
my doctor's cap on, I'm afraid.

45:30.796 --> 45:33.337
Maynard's here to discuss
his research program.

45:33.462 --> 45:39.004
- The schizophrenic-narco...
- Narcotherapy. It's a big word.

45:40.129 --> 45:44.337
Which reminds me, next Thursday's the big
fundraiser, so don't put us down for anything.

45:44.462 --> 45:46.796
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

45:49.379 --> 45:51.379
- Dennis!
- Phillip!

45:51.504 --> 45:53.296
You remember my wife Becky?

45:53.421 --> 45:56.129
- Yes. Nice to see you again.
- Dr. Maynard.

45:56.254 --> 46:00.087
- Do you two have plans?
- No.

46:00.754 --> 46:04.671
I just need to remember to call ahead
first if I'm going to be spontaneous.

46:04.796 --> 46:07.087
I see.

46:07.671 --> 46:11.004
- Okay, I'll just leave you guys, then.
- Okay, I shouldn't be late for dinner.

46:11.129 --> 46:14.129
Okay, and I'll see you Thursday
at the fundraiser.

46:14.421 --> 46:16.671
I look forward to it.

46:20.712 --> 46:22.129
It's hard to tell right off.

46:22.254 --> 46:25.671
Yeah, I wish you could have spent more time
with her. I didn't know she was coming.

46:25.796 --> 46:28.837
Well, I see what you're
talking about. Her...

46:28.962 --> 46:32.671
Her body language is very protective,
very concealing.

46:32.796 --> 46:35.671
She's deeply uncomfortable.

46:36.171 --> 46:39.296
- It's odd.
- She's always been skittish. I...

46:39.421 --> 46:42.004
I just... I don't know.

46:43.837 --> 46:46.171
- Wait, who's this guy?
- That's Muffler Mike.

46:46.296 --> 46:50.504
His muffler's been busted for about 8 years,
so everyone knows when he's coming.

46:50.629 --> 46:53.837
And that is Bob Griese.

46:53.962 --> 46:56.712
We call him, yup, Greasy Bob.

46:56.837 --> 46:59.712
Okay, so it's not brilliant, but...

47:05.545 --> 47:10.587
Yeah. I actually worked
with him once on a highway job.

47:10.712 --> 47:13.379
He's got a real interesting smell.

47:19.462 --> 47:22.629
- You got a problem, buddy?
- Tell him to go fuck himself.

47:22.754 --> 47:25.962
- No. Nope, nope. No problem at all.
- Go fuck yourself, dude!

47:26.087 --> 47:27.962
- We're cool.
- Such a wimp!

47:28.087 --> 47:30.795
What, you like it when we get hit?

47:33.295 --> 47:36.045
Hey, who's that? She's hot.

47:36.170 --> 47:38.379
Yeah, that's Donna. She's a nice girl.

47:38.629 --> 47:41.254
She's a nice girl? Is she married?

47:41.379 --> 47:44.420
- Is she covered in sores?
- Not to hear it.

47:45.420 --> 47:47.420
- Wait, she's waving!
- I know.

47:47.545 --> 47:50.504
- You guys are friends? Ask her out!
- I'm not gonna just ask her...

47:50.629 --> 47:52.670
No, don't be a wuss.
You know you want her.

47:52.795 --> 47:55.837
- Shut up.
- Look, she's coming over!

47:55.962 --> 47:59.129
What is this strange power
you have over women?

47:59.254 --> 48:02.337
- If you don't shut up, I'm gonna shut you out.
- Better not, not when our girlfriend's here.

48:02.462 --> 48:04.420
- Hey, Dylan.
- Come to you, wench!

48:04.545 --> 48:06.504
- Hey, Donna.
- Hey.

48:06.795 --> 48:09.379
Are you... here alone?

48:09.504 --> 48:12.379
Jenny's supposed to be coming, but...

48:13.170 --> 48:15.462
Haven't seen you around much lately.

48:16.087 --> 48:20.254
- Haven't been around.
- Duh! Say you like her shoes.

48:20.379 --> 48:21.754
I like your shoes.

48:21.879 --> 48:25.420
- They... they're... they work.
- I can't believe you noticed them.

48:25.545 --> 48:28.337
I got 'em on sale. They pretty much
go with everything, you know.

48:28.462 --> 48:31.212
See? You compliment them
on something they did or bought,

48:31.337 --> 48:33.337
not their eyes or something
they were born with.

48:33.462 --> 48:36.212
That's how they know you like them.
You like their tastes, you like...

48:36.337 --> 48:38.420
Shut up!

48:38.920 --> 48:41.129
I just hate this song.

48:41.254 --> 48:43.587
You're joking.
This is, like, my favorite song.

48:43.712 --> 48:48.920
- I know, I've heard it just so many times.
- Yeah, that's true. They do play it a lot.

48:50.712 --> 48:54.212
Ask her out! Ask her out! Ask her out!

48:54.337 --> 48:57.254
Say, Donna, I was thinking...

48:57.379 --> 49:01.379
are you... are you busy Tuesday night?

49:01.504 --> 49:04.045
I'm busy most nights.

49:07.129 --> 49:11.170
- What did you have in mind?
- I just thought that...

49:11.379 --> 49:13.254
I could cook for you!
I could cook for you!

49:13.379 --> 49:15.670
I could cook you dinner.

49:15.795 --> 49:19.170
- You cook?
- Yeah, I mean, well, a thing or two.

49:19.295 --> 49:21.629
What do you like?

49:22.129 --> 49:25.212
Well, I like steaks, big steaks.

49:25.337 --> 49:28.712
All right. All right, yeah.
I could... I'll fix you up...

49:28.837 --> 49:32.337
a rare steak with a fancy sauce
and trimmings for days.

49:32.462 --> 49:35.587
- I mean, if you're not too busy.
- I am so smooth.

49:35.712 --> 49:38.087
Tuesday I'm seeing my mama,
but I think Thursday I'm free.

49:38.504 --> 49:41.670
- Done. Dinner at 6:30.
- No, no, no, no.

49:41.795 --> 49:44.670
- I'm busy Thursday night.
- Yeah, you're not coming.

49:44.795 --> 49:47.129
Jenny's here. So, 6:30.

49:47.254 --> 49:51.504
- 6:30.
- Okay, gotta go. See you. Hey!

49:51.629 --> 49:53.920
Phillip and I have a fundraiser
Thursday night, you dope!

49:54.045 --> 49:56.920
You think I want you coming on my date,
telling me how to kiss and stuff?

49:57.045 --> 49:59.087
Who made you ask her out?
You couldn't even talk to her.

49:59.212 --> 50:01.837
- You're nothing without me.
- You're still not coming.

50:01.962 --> 50:05.087
I made you and I can break you.

50:27.295 --> 50:30.962
This event is going to be so great
for our narcotherapy project.

50:31.087 --> 50:34.170
A charity donation
is just like any other investment.

50:34.295 --> 50:36.920
You want to know your money
is being put to good use.

50:37.045 --> 50:41.295
You know, I can't think of a better place to
put your money than in the research fund.

50:41.420 --> 50:45.253
Well, of course you can't.
Your husband's on the board!

50:45.878 --> 50:49.670
But, no, you're right.
Sick people are always the best.

50:49.795 --> 50:52.295
Real lump in the throat stuff,
these hospital charities.

50:52.420 --> 50:56.503
- Give me cripples every time.
- These are psychos, not cripples.

50:56.628 --> 51:00.837
But, you know... would you mind
excusing me just a minute?

51:08.337 --> 51:10.170
- How's it going?
- What?

51:10.295 --> 51:13.420
- How's it going?
- I'm fine. Yeah.

51:13.545 --> 51:16.337
Why? What do you want?

51:16.462 --> 51:19.628
Nothing. I'm just checking in,
seeing how it's going.

51:19.753 --> 51:23.128
- Yeah, everything's great.
- Your sauce is burning.

51:24.545 --> 51:26.045
This is nuts.

51:26.170 --> 51:30.045
I haven't cooked anything that didn't
take microwave instructions since ever.

51:30.170 --> 51:32.420
Here, smell this.

51:33.878 --> 51:36.712
- What is that, rosemary?
- Yeah. Too much?

51:36.837 --> 51:41.920
- No, no. It's a little thick, though.
- You said it's supposed to be thick.

51:42.045 --> 51:45.337
Well, yeah, but just maybe not,
like, thick as a brick.

51:53.462 --> 51:56.170
- What? You hate this shirt.
- No, it's...

51:56.295 --> 51:59.337
This is the wrong shirt.
Women everywhere revile this shirt.

51:59.462 --> 52:02.045
Dylan, maintain.

52:02.753 --> 52:05.420
The tie's a little rodeo,
but it's gonna be okay.

52:05.545 --> 52:08.962
Yeah, easy for you to say.
How's your money dinner?

52:09.170 --> 52:10.837
You know, Stuffed Shirts Anonymous.

52:10.962 --> 52:13.878
I just have to worry about
not falling asleep.

52:14.003 --> 52:15.837
Shit!

52:16.753 --> 52:19.753
Hey, you're gonna be great! Good luck!

52:19.878 --> 52:21.712
Thanks.

52:27.087 --> 52:28.628
- Hi.
- How you doing?

52:28.753 --> 52:32.587
Good. How are you? Welcome to... oh, shit!

52:33.087 --> 52:34.962
Hold on.

52:41.128 --> 52:45.128
Okay. Everything... no, that's good.
Yeah, that would be great, yeah.

52:45.253 --> 52:47.503
- Come on in.
- Okay.

52:51.962 --> 52:54.670
- Never seen your place before.
- You haven't?

52:54.795 --> 52:57.128
I thought... you weren't out here
for the Fourth?

52:57.253 --> 53:00.337
- I don't think so.
- I thought you were.

53:00.462 --> 53:02.878
Yeah. I had a barbecue.

53:03.003 --> 53:05.962
It's kind of my own concept.
Barbecue on the Fourth of July.

53:06.628 --> 53:09.170
Lots of people do that.

53:10.503 --> 53:15.337
I... I really like your shoes.

53:15.462 --> 53:17.420
You got a thing for feet?

53:17.545 --> 53:19.670
Dated a guy like that once. Real weirdo.

53:19.795 --> 53:22.837
No, no, I don't. Would you like...
could I get you something to drink?

53:22.962 --> 53:26.045
I did pick up some red wine, if you like.

53:27.670 --> 53:29.128
You got a beer?

53:29.253 --> 53:32.253
Yeah. Yeah, definitely.
I'll take one of those, actually.

53:32.378 --> 53:34.212
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

53:34.337 --> 53:36.545
It's a twist, yeah. Cheers.

53:36.712 --> 53:38.503
Cheers.

53:40.712 --> 53:43.920
So, you really cook and everything?

53:44.045 --> 53:46.337
Now and then.

53:48.920 --> 53:52.587
- What's this?
- It's the sauce.

53:54.378 --> 53:58.170
- That smells kinda crazy.
- Bimbo.

53:58.878 --> 54:01.253
Well, it's not for tonight.

54:01.378 --> 54:03.295
Okay.

54:04.753 --> 54:09.711
Yeah. I don't like my steaks all fancy.
Just burnt black with tons of ketchup.

54:10.711 --> 54:14.211
- Figures.
- Figures what?

54:14.336 --> 54:17.253
- Sorry?
- I thought you had spoken.

54:17.378 --> 54:19.920
Oh, gosh.

54:20.045 --> 54:22.920
Maybe I did. I think I was...

54:25.045 --> 54:27.795
- Shoot! Oh, no!
- Hot! Hot! Hot!

54:28.211 --> 54:30.545
- Shoot!
- In the sink!

54:30.670 --> 54:32.336
- Put it in the sink!
- God damn!

54:32.461 --> 54:34.545
In the sink! In the sink!

54:35.128 --> 54:37.378
Oh, shit!

54:43.086 --> 54:46.045
- There. Happy now?
- Me?

54:46.628 --> 54:48.628
Maybe you'd better go
wash that off, honey.

54:48.753 --> 54:51.211
Stay out of this, Phil.

54:54.545 --> 54:57.753
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

54:57.961 --> 54:59.836
Yeah, why don't you go to the bathroom?

54:59.961 --> 55:01.461
- Collect yourself.
- I'm so sorry.

55:01.586 --> 55:04.670
- You're right, honey.
- Just... yeah.

55:05.211 --> 55:08.670
- It's okay. It's okay. You guys okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

55:08.795 --> 55:11.878
- Did you get anything on you?
- No, I'm fine. But is she all right?

55:12.003 --> 55:15.336
Yeah, she's fine. She's fine.

55:16.128 --> 55:18.086
Thank you.

55:20.295 --> 55:22.420
Who's Phil?

55:24.961 --> 55:27.545
Just give me a second.

55:27.670 --> 55:29.545
Okay.

55:31.086 --> 55:32.503
What did you think you were doing?

55:32.628 --> 55:35.003
I told you not to come along anyway.
I had everything under control.

55:35.128 --> 55:37.878
- You had everything on fire!
- Yeah, that's the way I like it.

55:38.003 --> 55:39.920
Sure, burnt black, tons of ketchup.

55:40.045 --> 55:43.670
It's none of your business what she eats,
you yuppie snob. That's my date!

55:43.795 --> 55:46.336
Yeah, well, you know,
you sure know how to pick 'em.

55:46.461 --> 55:49.753
What's the matter... are you jealous?

55:50.211 --> 55:52.003
No, I'm not jealous!

55:52.128 --> 55:54.836
- Then butt out!
- Why don't you make me?

55:56.295 --> 55:58.336
- Just make me.
- You think I won't?

55:58.461 --> 56:00.378
Yeah, sure. Try.

56:03.670 --> 56:06.295
- There!
- That's all you got?

56:06.961 --> 56:09.211
- Stop it!
- Did it again! Did it again!

56:09.336 --> 56:12.920
- Dylan, stop... stop it.
- I won't. No, I'm not going to.

56:13.045 --> 56:15.086
I won't.

56:17.211 --> 56:19.211
- Hey, Donna.
- Hey.

56:19.336 --> 56:22.461
I was just putting on some aftershave.

56:22.961 --> 56:26.711
- Just freshening up a little.
- I'm gonna go.

56:29.295 --> 56:31.045
Donna.

56:33.545 --> 56:34.836
Dylan?

56:35.753 --> 56:38.045
Donna, wait!

56:39.586 --> 56:41.336
I was just making a joke!

56:41.461 --> 56:45.670
I was just... putting on aftershave.

57:04.378 --> 57:06.628
You are gonna speak to me again
before we die, right?

57:06.753 --> 57:09.086
What do you want me to say, Rebecca?
Thank you.

57:09.211 --> 57:12.253
I'm so glad you made us look like idiots.

57:12.545 --> 57:14.586
You didn't even apologize to Dr. Maynard.

57:14.711 --> 57:18.086
I don't like Dr. Maynard. He always looks
at me like he's trying to guess my weight.

57:18.211 --> 57:20.670
He was trying to raise money
for an important project

57:20.795 --> 57:23.336
I happen to be involved with.

57:23.961 --> 57:26.878
Phillip, I can't say what happened.

57:27.003 --> 57:30.711
I think maybe I dozed off for a second.

57:30.836 --> 57:33.878
I was confused.
Haven't you ever done that?

57:34.003 --> 57:36.253
That's not it.

57:36.378 --> 57:39.586
I mean, that may be true, but...

57:41.128 --> 57:43.669
something is happening to you.

57:44.461 --> 57:47.128
And I don't know
if it's what happened before or not.

57:47.253 --> 57:49.128
It's not. Believe me.

57:49.253 --> 57:53.253
Okay, then what? What?

57:54.628 --> 57:57.794
I don't know, Phillip. Sometimes...

57:59.628 --> 58:02.294
sometimes you just look at everything

58:02.419 --> 58:05.169
and it's all just different.

58:05.669 --> 58:09.211
- Do you know?
- Yeah, I do. They call that puberty.

58:09.336 --> 58:13.086
No, it isn't just that and it never stops.

58:14.211 --> 58:16.419
It's like...

58:17.544 --> 58:19.711
like shedding your skin.

58:21.461 --> 58:23.669
Is that what you're doing?

58:24.544 --> 58:26.378
Shedding?

58:27.461 --> 58:30.336
Yeah, I guess, sort of.

58:32.128 --> 58:34.086
Shedding me?

58:34.461 --> 58:36.753
Oh, no.

58:37.836 --> 58:39.669
No.

01:00:02.503 --> 01:00:05.378
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:00:07.919 --> 01:00:11.586
I'm really sorry.
I know I messed it up. I know.

01:00:11.711 --> 01:00:16.378
No, no. It's cool. I would've messed it up
myself anyway. You just saved me time.

01:00:16.503 --> 01:00:19.753
Give yourself a little credit.
That girl really likes you.

01:00:19.878 --> 01:00:22.336
Well, if she did, I think
she got over that pretty quick

01:00:22.461 --> 01:00:25.544
when she caught me talking
to the little man inside my head.

01:00:25.669 --> 01:00:28.961
Yeah... right.

01:00:30.378 --> 01:00:33.586
It's just sometimes
when I'm with you, I forget myself.

01:00:38.461 --> 01:00:40.711
You feel funny.

01:00:40.836 --> 01:00:44.544
- What?
- Don't you feel funny? Like, not...

01:00:44.669 --> 01:00:46.961
Not a fever, but...

01:00:47.378 --> 01:00:49.253
I...

01:00:49.961 --> 01:00:55.669
I was... previously engaged
in a certain kind of activity and...

01:01:00.044 --> 01:01:02.169
Well, you smell nice.

01:01:03.086 --> 01:01:05.419
Kinda sweaty.

01:01:07.211 --> 01:01:09.377
Sorry, that...

01:01:09.794 --> 01:01:12.419
that was out of line. I didn't...

01:01:14.086 --> 01:01:15.794
I should go.

01:01:18.877 --> 01:01:22.586
Okay. Well, look, I'm sorry about tonight.

01:01:23.169 --> 01:01:25.711
Yeah, me, too.

01:01:27.711 --> 01:01:29.461
Well, good night.

01:01:30.211 --> 01:01:32.294
Good night.

01:01:34.461 --> 01:01:36.544
Good night.

01:01:37.044 --> 01:01:39.252
Good night.

01:01:44.461 --> 01:01:46.544
Good night.

01:01:50.877 --> 01:01:53.086
Okay, well, wait, here comes a good one.

01:01:53.211 --> 01:01:55.336
"Number seven, how does
your partner rate as a lover?"

01:01:55.461 --> 01:01:56.544
- Pass.
- No, wait!

01:01:56.669 --> 01:01:59.752
Pass, pass, pass!
That's none of your business.

01:01:59.877 --> 01:02:03.086
Of course it's my business. Hush up!
"You describe your lovemaking as...

01:02:03.211 --> 01:02:07.127
A, wild animals; B, sweet and slow;

01:02:07.252 --> 01:02:09.877
C, at least he tries; D"...

01:02:10.002 --> 01:02:12.502
- Who's he talking to?
- I don't know.

01:02:13.627 --> 01:02:17.336
B? A. No, no. Yeah.

01:02:17.461 --> 01:02:20.836
- B?
- Okay, if you say so.

01:02:20.961 --> 01:02:23.002
"Nine, how often do you and your mate..."

01:02:23.127 --> 01:02:24.961
- No, pass!
- Why?

01:02:25.086 --> 01:02:29.877
- Come on, this isn't gonna work unless...
- Wait! Turn up the radio.

01:02:31.044 --> 01:02:32.377
You like this?

01:02:33.502 --> 01:02:36.586
Yeah, I love this song.

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:38.877
Yeah, I remember this.

01:02:39.419 --> 01:02:44.127
<i>I stand up so I can fall</i>

01:02:44.252 --> 01:02:46.461
<i>I storm out</i>

01:02:46.586 --> 01:02:48.919
<i>So I can wait for you to call</i>

01:02:49.044 --> 01:02:53.086
<i>I just look at you, baby, that's all</i>

01:02:53.877 --> 01:02:56.377
<i>I'm crumbling</i>

01:02:56.502 --> 01:02:58.294
<i>I'm crumbling</i>

01:02:58.419 --> 01:03:02.586
<i>I wake up and you're not there</i>

01:03:02.711 --> 01:03:05.961
<i>I call all my friends</i>

01:03:06.086 --> 01:03:08.044
<i>Tell 'em I don't care</i>

01:03:08.169 --> 01:03:12.752
<i>I'm so cool, baby, and debonair</i>

01:03:13.211 --> 01:03:15.669
<i>I'm crumbling...</i>

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:28.252
- Hey!
- Phillip.

01:03:28.836 --> 01:03:32.669
Hi. Is this more... shedding?

01:03:33.169 --> 01:03:35.002
No.

01:03:35.127 --> 01:03:37.502
This is dancing.

01:03:38.044 --> 01:03:40.336
Yeah, it is.

01:03:40.461 --> 01:03:42.294
Okay.

01:03:42.877 --> 01:03:44.377
I'll see you.

01:03:44.502 --> 01:03:46.669
So what brings the party down here?

01:03:46.794 --> 01:03:49.794
I was just looking
for my old photo albums.

01:03:49.919 --> 01:03:52.711
- I thought they were in the corner.
- Yeah.

01:03:52.836 --> 01:03:55.961
Yeah, last time I saw them, they were...

01:03:56.669 --> 01:03:58.836
God, I hope Bridget didn't throw them out.

01:03:58.961 --> 01:04:01.044
No, that doesn't make any sense.
She would've asked...

01:04:01.169 --> 01:04:05.794
I ran into Diane. She said you
were gonna do the painting class.

01:04:05.919 --> 01:04:07.752
- The drawing class.
- The drawing class, yeah.

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:11.127
- Yeah, I don't have to.
- What? No, I think that's great!

01:04:11.252 --> 01:04:14.877
You know?
Get you out of your... the cellar.

01:04:17.794 --> 01:04:19.669
Why would Bridget throw out my photos?

01:04:19.794 --> 01:04:22.711
I'm not saying... just, you know...
whatever by accident.

01:04:22.836 --> 01:04:26.502
- What do you want with them anyway?
- Nothing, I just wanted to show them to...

01:04:26.627 --> 01:04:29.419
to... to...

01:04:30.169 --> 01:04:32.461
myself. Look at them.

01:04:32.586 --> 01:04:35.919
I mean, I'm not saying don't find them.
It's a healthy thing. That's good.

01:04:36.044 --> 01:04:39.544
And actually, I can help you
look for them. I have my...

01:04:39.669 --> 01:04:41.919
council meeting at 6:00, but...

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:44.335
you know, it won't kill me
to be a few minutes late.

01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:46.377
Yes, it will.

01:04:48.669 --> 01:04:51.710
Thank you for knowing that about me.

01:04:54.794 --> 01:04:58.002
Hey, is my gray shirt clean?

01:04:58.127 --> 01:05:00.419
- Yeah. I'll check.
- Thank you.

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:16.044
Everything come out all right?

01:05:17.877 --> 01:05:19.794
You're drunk!

01:05:19.919 --> 01:05:22.377
I ain't had hardly nothing to drink.

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:24.877
But give me time, partner.

01:05:25.002 --> 01:05:27.877
I got wine on my damn pants.

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.335
What's Phillip gonna think?

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:35.252
- Where is old Phil?
- Meeting.

01:05:36.085 --> 01:05:38.960
Have I given you the tour
of my luxurious home?

01:05:39.085 --> 01:05:40.502
Yeah, you have.

01:05:40.627 --> 01:05:45.835
Elegant modern entertainment center.
The perfect addition to every home.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.877
Did you find those pictures
you were gonna show me?

01:05:51.502 --> 01:05:53.294
They're gone.

01:05:53.419 --> 01:05:57.419
- W... wait a minute, what happened?
- They're gone.

01:05:58.710 --> 01:06:04.960
I have been through...
the entire attractively furnished house.

01:06:05.335 --> 01:06:07.544
Maybe the maid ate them.

01:06:07.669 --> 01:06:11.960
Or maybe my husband
slipped them into the trash.

01:06:12.085 --> 01:06:14.127
Are you serious?
Why the hell would he do that?

01:06:14.252 --> 01:06:17.044
Because he knows me.

01:06:17.752 --> 01:06:19.710
Phillip takes care of me.

01:06:19.835 --> 01:06:22.794
That's not taking... that's... that sucks.

01:06:22.919 --> 01:06:25.460
He's not being mean.

01:06:26.127 --> 01:06:29.502
He knows how funky I get sometimes

01:06:29.627 --> 01:06:31.710
looking through that stuff.

01:06:31.835 --> 01:06:35.544
It doesn't matter anyway.
I know them all by heart.

01:06:35.669 --> 01:06:38.544
There's my mom when she's little.

01:06:38.669 --> 01:06:40.585
She has my eyes.

01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:43.210
Blue-gray with flecks of panic.

01:06:43.335 --> 01:06:47.627
And here's Mom teaching me how to swim.

01:06:47.752 --> 01:06:50.627
Notice how I'm grafted to her arm.

01:06:50.752 --> 01:06:53.294
Not a success.

01:06:53.544 --> 01:06:56.502
And there's a picture of a pony.

01:06:57.002 --> 01:07:00.544
I don't know why it's in there
or who it belonged to, but...

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.627
there it is anyway.

01:07:04.002 --> 01:07:06.752
And there's my dad.

01:07:07.919 --> 01:07:11.502
The scariest man who ever lived.

01:07:12.169 --> 01:07:14.794
Grown-ups were scared of him.

01:07:16.002 --> 01:07:19.169
All they ever taught me
was how to be afraid.

01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:24.335
And I went out and found
the copingest man alive...

01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:26.377
so he could take care of me.

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:30.794
So he could get rid of the past.

01:07:31.169 --> 01:07:33.710
Chipping away at it...

01:07:34.752 --> 01:07:39.085
all my little quirks and insecurities.

01:07:39.794 --> 01:07:41.627
Until...

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.877
voila.

01:07:45.419 --> 01:07:47.627
Nothing left.

01:07:58.335 --> 01:08:01.877
Nothing like a little truth
to sober you up?

01:08:06.252 --> 01:08:10.502
Tell you about my family.
I got a brother named Mitch.

01:08:10.918 --> 01:08:13.960
I think he lives down in Louisville now,
moved 1,500 miles away

01:08:14.085 --> 01:08:18.085
so that he wouldn't have
to loan me any more money.

01:08:18.210 --> 01:08:21.710
My mom, I put her through so much,

01:08:21.835 --> 01:08:25.127
by the time I got popped,
she had stopped talking to me.

01:08:26.210 --> 01:08:28.835
She didn't even wait for the trial.

01:08:30.417 --> 01:08:33.917
I've never met anyone I didn't disappoint.

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:39.917
I mean, the best thing, the only thing,

01:08:40.042 --> 01:08:44.460
about me that I like... is you.

01:09:05.792 --> 01:09:10.627
<i>I wanna feel your touch</i>

01:09:13.002 --> 01:09:17.335
<i>It's burning me like an ember...</i>

01:09:19.585 --> 01:09:22.042
Oh, fuck.

01:09:23.167 --> 01:09:26.752
I wish you weren't so damn pretty,
Becky Porter.

01:09:28.627 --> 01:09:31.127
I know that's dumb and shallow and...

01:09:31.252 --> 01:09:35.292
I mean, you're a married woman
and I'm on parole.

01:09:36.417 --> 01:09:39.042
Still, sometimes I think...

01:09:42.002 --> 01:09:44.502
I just wish you weren't so damn pretty.

01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:54.042
<i>To the trouble I'm in</i>

01:09:57.627 --> 01:10:01.460
<i>So I'm giving in</i>

01:10:04.627 --> 01:10:08.960
<i>To the trouble I'm in</i>

01:10:12.252 --> 01:10:16.585
<i>To the trouble I'm in...</i>

01:10:18.418 --> 01:10:21.127
I wanna know what you feel like.

01:10:22.543 --> 01:10:26.710
<i>You are, you are</i>

01:10:26.835 --> 01:10:30.002
<i>My favorite medicine</i>

01:10:30.127 --> 01:10:34.085
<i>You are, you are</i>

01:10:34.210 --> 01:10:37.377
<i>You're where the lights begin</i>

01:10:37.502 --> 01:10:41.543
<i>You are, you are</i>

01:10:41.668 --> 01:10:44.918
<i>Just one last time again</i>

01:10:45.043 --> 01:10:49.168
<i>You are, you are</i>

01:10:49.293 --> 01:10:53.085
<i>You are the trouble I'm in</i>

01:10:56.668 --> 01:11:01.460
<i>You are the trouble I'm in</i>

01:11:04.168 --> 01:11:07.418
<i>You are the trouble I'm in</i>

01:11:07.543 --> 01:11:11.585
<i>You are, you are</i>

01:11:11.710 --> 01:11:14.835
<i>My favorite medicine</i>

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:19.127
<i>You are, you are</i>

01:11:19.252 --> 01:11:22.335
<i>You're where the lights begin</i>

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:26.543
<i>You are, you are</i>

01:11:26.668 --> 01:11:29.668
<i>Just one last time again</i>

01:11:29.877 --> 01:11:34.043
<i>You are, you are</i>

01:11:34.168 --> 01:11:39.126
<i>You are the trouble I'm in</i>

01:11:41.585 --> 01:11:46.626
<i>You are the trouble I'm in</i>

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:20.793
Cut it out. It's good!

01:12:20.918 --> 01:12:24.210
It's cool! Look at Diane's.

01:12:26.626 --> 01:12:31.210
That's a little abstract, there, darling.
Try drawing the nice man.

01:12:37.335 --> 01:12:40.168
Dylan, my office.

01:12:40.668 --> 01:12:44.126
- Gotta go, darlin'.
- Okay, I'll see you.

01:12:47.001 --> 01:12:49.001
What's going on, Jake?

01:12:49.793 --> 01:12:51.168
It's no good.

01:12:52.335 --> 01:12:54.876
- What is?
- It's no good.

01:12:55.168 --> 01:12:59.043
- It doesn't work.
- Wait, wait. Am I fired?

01:12:59.168 --> 01:13:02.376
Okay, you and me, Dylan. Okay?

01:13:02.501 --> 01:13:08.168
What would you do? Keep the ex-con
who talks to himself all day?

01:13:10.335 --> 01:13:12.960
You frighten the customers.

01:13:13.501 --> 01:13:15.626
Look, next time you get a gig, okay,

01:13:15.751 --> 01:13:19.626
just let your imaginary friend
stay at home.

01:13:19.751 --> 01:13:20.668
Okay.

01:13:20.793 --> 01:13:23.043
You gotta start living
in the world, brother.

01:13:23.168 --> 01:13:26.835
You gotta be where you at.
You understand what I'm saying?

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.001
- Be where you at.
- Okay.

01:13:29.126 --> 01:13:31.876
I'll give you a recommendation
if you need one.

01:13:32.001 --> 01:13:34.210
I won't lie...

01:13:34.335 --> 01:13:37.918
but I'll... I'll say you were honest.

01:13:38.335 --> 01:13:40.126
Okay.

01:13:58.251 --> 01:14:00.543
What happened, bro?

01:14:20.793 --> 01:14:22.960
Hon, I'm your friend.

01:14:23.085 --> 01:14:26.210
Good. I mean, yes, of course you are.

01:14:26.918 --> 01:14:29.460
You can tell me. You really should.

01:14:29.585 --> 01:14:33.335
Sweetie, I honestly... I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:14:33.835 --> 01:14:36.126
Not at all?

01:14:36.293 --> 01:14:39.501
Well, everybody's concerned.

01:14:40.001 --> 01:14:44.376
Is something going on? You can tell me.

01:14:45.126 --> 01:14:48.376
There's just really nothing to tell.

01:14:49.293 --> 01:14:52.376
- Have you been seeing someone?
- Oh, God, no. No, no, no, no, no.

01:14:52.501 --> 01:14:55.376
I couldn't. I'm married. I would never...

01:14:55.501 --> 01:14:57.918
I meant a shrink.

01:14:58.126 --> 01:15:00.501
You're having an affair. Oh, my God!

01:15:00.626 --> 01:15:02.876
You don't have to tell me who
unless you want to.

01:15:03.001 --> 01:15:06.209
Diane, honestly... Diane, I'm not...
I'm not having an affair.

01:15:06.334 --> 01:15:08.876
And we never had this conversation.

01:15:09.001 --> 01:15:11.251
Poor Phillip. I didn't mean that.

01:15:11.376 --> 01:15:16.418
You know what? You don't have to
tell me who. That just explains everything.

01:15:16.543 --> 01:15:18.876
Explains what?

01:15:21.168 --> 01:15:24.543
Well, I don't mind telling you
now that I know you're not crazy,

01:15:24.668 --> 01:15:26.709
but everybody's talking.

01:15:26.834 --> 01:15:29.334
Well, you must know that.

01:15:29.751 --> 01:15:32.876
Everybody's talking about me. Why?

01:15:33.001 --> 01:15:35.251
- Don't they have lives?
- My lips are sealed.

01:15:35.376 --> 01:15:40.043
They are Ziploc'd. You don't have to
tell me who he is, but is it someone I know?

01:15:40.168 --> 01:15:42.334
Diane, honestly, I'm not having an affair.

01:15:42.459 --> 01:15:46.168
I'm not, I swear. Okay? I'm just crazy.

01:15:55.501 --> 01:15:59.084
Amazing! That's possibly the greatest
game of pool ever played.

01:16:00.293 --> 01:16:03.209
- Hi, Dylan.
- Oh, hey. Queen of the rodeo.

01:16:03.334 --> 01:16:07.543
Rodeo queen? What, you came
to watch me make pool history?

01:16:10.001 --> 01:16:11.334
Had a few pitchers, haven't you?

01:16:11.459 --> 01:16:16.334
You know, my only regret is that I gave up
my law practice to become a showgirl.

01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:20.043
- Can I pour myself one?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:16:20.168 --> 01:16:22.501
Hey, hey, hey. Have a beer.

01:16:26.001 --> 01:16:28.668
I'm just gonna find this ball.

01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:32.209
So, Wayne says that Jake gave you the can.

01:16:32.334 --> 01:16:34.876
- That blows.
- Don't it, sister?

01:16:35.001 --> 01:16:36.751
Where the hell
you been hiding at, Dill Pickle?

01:16:36.876 --> 01:16:38.626
Thank God you've come.

01:16:41.501 --> 01:16:43.793
Is it time to do crimes?

01:16:45.959 --> 01:16:48.584
Yeah, man, we've been waiting on you.

01:16:49.959 --> 01:16:51.043
Cue ball.

01:16:51.168 --> 01:16:52.876
Enough dicking around.
Are we doing this or not?

01:16:53.001 --> 01:16:54.876
Hell yes! Let's do it.

01:16:55.168 --> 01:16:57.876
- Let's do it.
- All right, here's the address.

01:16:58.001 --> 01:17:01.834
I need you to roll up there and check
the place out. We go in Thursday night.

01:17:01.959 --> 01:17:03.251
Let's do it now.

01:17:03.376 --> 01:17:05.709
Let's do it now! I mean,
what am I waiting for? Right?

01:17:05.834 --> 01:17:09.668
This is what I do. I mean,
I'm a criminal-element-man type, man.

01:17:09.793 --> 01:17:12.584
Just like you. Like, who am I kidding?

01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:16.501
Maybe you've had enough, Dill.
Maybe you wanna head home, sleep it off.

01:17:16.626 --> 01:17:20.084
Oh, no, I want some action!
I want some "Action Jackson!"

01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:22.709
Come on, let's get lost!

01:17:23.168 --> 01:17:25.209
Hey, you can be my mom.

01:17:25.334 --> 01:17:28.334
Yeah. I mean, I gotta have a mom.

01:17:31.626 --> 01:17:34.709
You see, I got this problem, though.

01:17:34.834 --> 01:17:37.709
It's that Jiminy the Cricket
is gonna get all upset with me, man,

01:17:37.834 --> 01:17:40.001
and I can't go messing
with Jiminy the Cricket.

01:17:40.126 --> 01:17:44.251
She lives in my head with Mr. Crick...
excuse me, Dr. Cricket.

01:17:44.376 --> 01:17:47.751
And what am I gonna do when she finds out
that I'm just like everybody said.

01:17:47.876 --> 01:17:49.668
What am I gonna do then, Bo?

01:17:49.793 --> 01:17:51.959
You got voices in your head?
Is that what you're saying?

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:53.918
- You don't believe me? Donna?
- He does.

01:17:54.043 --> 01:17:57.001
Yeah, I have a world of craziness
up here, man.

01:17:57.126 --> 01:18:00.126
So you might wanna find somebody
a little more stable to be your wire man.

01:18:00.251 --> 01:18:01.959
Maybe I'm not your guy.

01:18:02.084 --> 01:18:05.209
- Burglary's a pretty tricky piece of business.
- It's time to shut your mouth, Dill.

01:18:05.334 --> 01:18:08.459
I'm getting so sick of everybody
telling me what to do.

01:18:13.001 --> 01:18:17.876
All right, step back, Dylan. And step back.
You two, get the hell out of my bar.

01:18:18.001 --> 01:18:20.918
All right, Wayne. Put the gun down.
Okay, Wayne.

01:18:21.043 --> 01:18:23.793
- I got a lump the size of Nebraska.
- Okay, shut up. Shut up, Lyle, shut up.

01:18:23.918 --> 01:18:25.834
- It's okay. Everything's fine.
- Am I bleeding?

01:18:25.959 --> 01:18:29.543
Everything's fine. Shut up, Lyle.

01:18:30.418 --> 01:18:33.042
I don't care how long
we've known each other.

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:35.834
You screw this up...

01:18:36.417 --> 01:18:39.292
Bo, look at my hair, man. Am I bleeding?

01:18:39.417 --> 01:18:42.376
Bo, man, my head's gonna
be all discolored.

01:19:23.292 --> 01:19:27.876
Diane. Hi. I just got the call
that you were here.

01:19:28.001 --> 01:19:31.167
To what do I owe this pleasant surprise?

01:19:35.834 --> 01:19:37.709
What?

01:20:10.626 --> 01:20:12.167
Do you recognize it?

01:20:19.542 --> 01:20:24.542
- That doesn't even look any smaller.
- I never came here again.

01:20:25.501 --> 01:20:27.334
I was scared.

01:20:28.126 --> 01:20:32.501
It just felt like
there was something here.

01:20:33.834 --> 01:20:36.792
Something too grown-up.

01:20:37.917 --> 01:20:40.209
Too real.

01:20:41.959 --> 01:20:45.876
Do you think this is the place I first
went nuts, or does it go further back?

01:20:46.001 --> 01:20:50.001
- Come on, you're not crazy, Becky.
- I was once...

01:20:50.126 --> 01:20:52.417
right after college...

01:20:52.542 --> 01:20:55.667
before Phillip and I were engaged.

01:20:57.084 --> 01:20:58.917
I...

01:20:59.751 --> 01:21:01.751
kind of fell apart.

01:21:03.542 --> 01:21:07.001
I couldn't deal with being
in the world, so...

01:21:07.126 --> 01:21:11.501
I spent some time in a hospital upstate.

01:21:12.917 --> 01:21:15.376
Rehabilitating.

01:21:17.209 --> 01:21:20.834
- I didn't know about that.
- Yeah, you missed that one.

01:21:21.709 --> 01:21:24.376
Probably because I missed most of it, too.

01:21:25.667 --> 01:21:28.251
I couldn't feel anything.

01:21:28.667 --> 01:21:32.167
I just lay in bed for three months,

01:21:32.792 --> 01:21:36.001
trying to work up enough energy to cry.

01:21:39.751 --> 01:21:42.876
Phillip was with me through all of it.
He read to me.

01:21:43.167 --> 01:21:45.959
He sat with me.

01:21:47.084 --> 01:21:49.751
Tried to get me through it.

01:21:50.834 --> 01:21:53.376
He probably did.

01:21:55.459 --> 01:21:57.917
Sure wasn't me.

01:21:59.834 --> 01:22:01.500
I'm so goddamn weak.

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:05.584
Becky, how can you say that?
I mean, what you did for me...

01:22:05.709 --> 01:22:09.542
Have I made your life
any easier, honestly?

01:22:09.667 --> 01:22:10.750
Yes.

01:22:15.334 --> 01:22:19.459
You know, I can't read your mind, Dylan,
but I know when you're lying.

01:22:21.292 --> 01:22:24.834
- Becky, don't do this.
- I can't live like this.

01:22:25.417 --> 01:22:27.292
Dylan...

01:22:27.959 --> 01:22:30.834
Phillip is my husband.

01:22:31.167 --> 01:22:33.500
I know you don't like him,

01:22:33.625 --> 01:22:36.167
but I need to be with him.

01:22:36.292 --> 01:22:37.875
I need to find him again.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.167
Yeah, you gotta do
what you're told, right?

01:22:40.292 --> 01:22:42.792
- That's not fair.
- Fair?

01:22:42.917 --> 01:22:46.709
I finally... for once in my life,
I can see something...

01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:49.959
something real, and then
you tell me I gotta give it up.

01:22:50.084 --> 01:22:53.084
So, how do you come at fair?

01:22:53.375 --> 01:22:56.292
I can't be with you and I...

01:22:57.292 --> 01:22:59.792
I can't play at this anymore.

01:22:59.917 --> 01:23:02.709
It's not a game.
It's not something that you play.

01:23:02.834 --> 01:23:05.250
What am I supposed to do?

01:23:05.375 --> 01:23:08.042
You are going to be fine.

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:11.250
God, Dylan...

01:23:13.625 --> 01:23:16.250
you have so much.

01:23:18.250 --> 01:23:20.000
You...

01:23:20.792 --> 01:23:23.292
you blew me away.

01:23:24.209 --> 01:23:26.875
You know that. You...

01:23:27.167 --> 01:23:29.750
I'm never gonna forget that.

01:23:29.875 --> 01:23:31.959
- Couldn't we just...
- No.

01:23:33.667 --> 01:23:37.209
How do you expect me to just shut you off?

01:23:39.125 --> 01:23:41.875
Because you love me.

01:25:15.125 --> 01:25:17.209
Can I get a whiskey neat, please?

01:25:17.334 --> 01:25:22.125
The thing is, you come in here,
and there's always some kind of trouble.

01:25:24.667 --> 01:25:26.792
Is that what you hear?

01:25:26.917 --> 01:25:30.417
About two nights ago, you were in here
doing your little MMA-style tango

01:25:30.542 --> 01:25:33.292
- with the Soames brothers.
- They showed up, I left.

01:25:33.417 --> 01:25:37.875
- We didn't associate.
- Dylan, this ain't a goddamn drill, okay?

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.583
You done got yourself fired,
you're hanging out with known felons,

01:25:40.708 --> 01:25:43.208
and now Lyle is looking
to bust your ass all across the desert.

01:25:43.333 --> 01:25:46.250
- Look, can you...
- No!

01:25:46.375 --> 01:25:48.167
No!

01:25:49.042 --> 01:25:52.625
No! No, please stop.

01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:56.292
- What's wrong with you?
- Please!

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:07.792
Dylan. Dylan.

01:26:09.958 --> 01:26:12.375
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Those bastards!

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.458
Who? Bo and Lyle?

01:26:14.583 --> 01:26:17.417
Know what I'm looking
at right now? A cell.

01:26:17.542 --> 01:26:19.417
You tell me what's going on
with them brothers,

01:26:19.542 --> 01:26:22.708
- you won't even have to think about that.
- I mean, I'm looking at it right now.

01:26:22.833 --> 01:26:24.542
- I'm in it.
- What?

01:26:24.667 --> 01:26:27.708
This is where they put me,
'cause this is where they see me.

01:26:27.833 --> 01:26:31.750
Wait a minute, so this is when you start
blaming the whole world for your crap,

01:26:31.875 --> 01:26:34.792
- is that right?
- No, no, this is where I stop.

01:26:38.208 --> 01:26:40.292
We ain't finished.

01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:48.167
I want you to get better.

01:26:48.917 --> 01:26:51.000
Just stop...

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.792
worrying about everything.

01:26:54.917 --> 01:26:57.375
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:26:59.292 --> 01:27:02.292
You just need to be...

01:27:02.792 --> 01:27:06.750
alone for a while. No distractions...

01:27:06.875 --> 01:27:10.333
till you feel yourself again.

01:27:21.917 --> 01:27:24.083
Rebecca...

01:27:24.208 --> 01:27:26.542
I love you.

01:27:56.875 --> 01:27:59.125
Oh, fuck.

01:28:01.792 --> 01:28:05.167
There, now be both got lumps on our heads.

01:28:05.292 --> 01:28:06.250
Come on.

01:28:06.375 --> 01:28:09.667
It's Thursday! Time to go to work, Dill.

01:28:09.792 --> 01:28:13.042
- I got to be somewhere.
- Yeah, and we know where.

01:28:13.167 --> 01:28:15.083
You know, I told Bo...

01:28:15.208 --> 01:28:17.542
that we should bust you up
and leave you there when we're through,

01:28:17.667 --> 01:28:21.083
- but he's got a code.
- Two hours and comfortable living, Dill.

01:28:21.208 --> 01:28:24.792
- No, I need to be somewhere. I'm asking.
- And I'm answering.

01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:44.875
We'll worry about forms later.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.833
None of your people
will even know she was here.

01:28:47.958 --> 01:28:51.542
I'm betting she'll be back to normal
in just a couple of months.

01:28:51.667 --> 01:28:53.458
Maybe.

01:29:11.333 --> 01:29:14.125
Did you see who was driving that car?

01:29:14.625 --> 01:29:16.416
Okay.

01:29:30.708 --> 01:29:33.625
- <i>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen...</i>
- Becca?

01:29:36.166 --> 01:29:38.000
Becca.

01:29:39.958 --> 01:29:42.250
Can you hear me?

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.125
Come on, answer me, Rebecca.

01:29:46.958 --> 01:29:48.791
Dylan.

01:29:49.791 --> 01:29:52.625
Jesus Christ. Rebecca, what is going on?

01:29:54.708 --> 01:29:57.416
Phillip put me in here.

01:29:57.541 --> 01:29:59.791
I think he thinks I'm having an affair.

01:29:59.916 --> 01:30:03.250
So he locks you up? Can he do that?

01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:05.041
I don't know.

01:30:06.875 --> 01:30:11.250
I'm afraid of him.
I don't know what he's gonna do.

01:30:11.375 --> 01:30:14.916
God, you feel like you're underwater.
What are they giving you?

01:30:15.041 --> 01:30:17.416
Phillip gave me these pills.

01:30:17.541 --> 01:30:21.000
I took them. He told me
to take them, so I took them.

01:30:21.791 --> 01:30:26.541
- Do you know where you are?
- Yeah. No.

01:30:26.666 --> 01:30:31.083
I think it's the... Hophauer Clinic.

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:33.041
It's a mental institution.

01:30:33.166 --> 01:30:36.208
Your husband ought to be
a permanent resident, darlin'.

01:30:36.333 --> 01:30:39.208
- <i>...once again we do request that you...</i>
- Are you on a plane?

01:30:39.333 --> 01:30:42.958
Yeah, I'm... I'm headed your way.

01:30:45.083 --> 01:30:47.791
Listen, I need to see the room.

01:30:48.958 --> 01:30:52.625
I want you to look around.
I want to see everything.

01:31:03.875 --> 01:31:06.375
- But is there anything you can do...
- I understand, sir,

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:10.083
but unfortunately we cannot rent you
a vehicle without a valid driver's license.

01:31:10.208 --> 01:31:12.583
I just... I just don't have it
with me right now is all

01:31:12.708 --> 01:31:16.166
- and I have a real important job interview.
- And I do hope you get that job.

01:31:16.291 --> 01:31:18.458
What I can do is arrange a cab for you.

01:31:18.583 --> 01:31:21.541
Perhaps a friend can overnight
your license while I hold the reser...

01:31:21.666 --> 01:31:24.875
- Sir?
- Thanks.

01:31:48.958 --> 01:31:51.375
<i>Loading and unloading of passengers...</i>

01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:54.375
- Where are you?
- Still at the airport.

01:31:55.291 --> 01:31:57.666
What are you doing?

01:31:58.375 --> 01:31:59.750
Renting.

01:32:00.458 --> 01:32:03.458
Hey, that's my car. Hey, yo, stop!

01:32:13.041 --> 01:32:15.750
No, twist it to the left.

01:32:15.875 --> 01:32:17.708
Slowly.

01:32:18.125 --> 01:32:21.791
Okay. Now, see if you can find
the empty space in there.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.708
Dylan, I can't do this.
I feel like a four-year-old.

01:32:24.833 --> 01:32:26.875
You can do it. Just relax.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.166
This ain't Fort Knox.
These are simple locks.

01:32:30.375 --> 01:32:32.583
Turn here.

01:32:33.541 --> 01:32:36.458
Where'd you learn to do
all this stuff anyway?

01:32:36.958 --> 01:32:38.749
School, mostly.

01:32:39.333 --> 01:32:41.208
I always wondered
what you guys did in shop.

01:32:41.333 --> 01:32:45.583
I bet you took ballet?
Or tea appreciation or something.

01:32:45.874 --> 01:32:47.583
Oboe.

01:32:49.666 --> 01:32:51.541
Holy shit! Holy shit.

01:32:51.666 --> 01:32:54.249
Hot damn!
That took me a week to learn that.

01:32:54.374 --> 01:32:59.333
- You're a natural born criminal.
- I bet you say that to all the girls.

01:33:00.499 --> 01:33:02.124
- Am I close?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:33:02.249 --> 01:33:06.208
Just keep going all the way. It's right
by the train tracks. You can't miss it.

01:33:06.333 --> 01:33:09.374
Okay, I'll find it.
Time to get a move on now.

01:33:09.499 --> 01:33:11.666
Anybody in the hall?

01:33:12.958 --> 01:33:14.333
Wait a sec.

01:33:16.041 --> 01:33:18.208
Wait till she leaves the hall.

01:33:21.249 --> 01:33:23.083
Check.

01:33:23.333 --> 01:33:25.958
- Nervous?
- Check.

01:33:26.083 --> 01:33:28.999
Listen, hey, when you get out of there...

01:33:29.333 --> 01:33:31.041
you ever seen Canada?

01:33:32.249 --> 01:33:33.874
Why? What did you have in mind?

01:33:33.999 --> 01:33:38.041
I thought maybe you'd like to have
a romance in an exotic setting.

01:33:43.499 --> 01:33:46.833
Go for it. Just walk like
you know where you're going.

01:34:17.041 --> 01:34:18.833
Oh, shit.

01:34:35.999 --> 01:34:38.624
Do you have any idea where I am?

01:34:43.583 --> 01:34:46.333
No, get back on Main Street.

01:34:49.833 --> 01:34:51.916
Not a good idea.

01:34:53.666 --> 01:34:55.124
Shit!

01:34:55.249 --> 01:34:57.666
<i>Turn off the engine
and show me your hands.</i>

01:34:58.791 --> 01:35:01.166
How are you doing today?

01:35:07.999 --> 01:35:10.249
Here goes nothing.

01:35:12.124 --> 01:35:14.083
<i>Stop the car!</i>

01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:16.499
<i>I said stop!</i>

01:36:37.582 --> 01:36:39.832
God. Oh, my God.

01:36:42.166 --> 01:36:44.207
Oh, my God.

01:36:44.749 --> 01:36:48.332
- Dylan, I can't talk to him. I can't.
- Becky, calm down. You can do this.

01:36:48.707 --> 01:36:51.541
Okay, okay.

01:36:51.666 --> 01:36:54.499
I'm just going to walk past him.
It's gonna be totally fine.

01:36:58.416 --> 01:37:00.416
Rebecca? What are you doing?

01:37:02.916 --> 01:37:05.749
- Told you I couldn't talk to him.
- Go. Becky, just go.

01:37:05.874 --> 01:37:08.582
- Phillip. Call security.
- Becca!

01:37:18.999 --> 01:37:20.520
He's gone.

01:37:33.124 --> 01:37:36.249
The woods. The woods, go!

01:38:13.291 --> 01:38:15.207
- Hear that train?
- Yes.

01:38:15.332 --> 01:38:17.374
Run for it!

01:38:37.791 --> 01:38:40.499
- I'm here.
- Where?

01:38:42.707 --> 01:38:44.457
Where?

01:38:48.082 --> 01:38:50.791
- Where?
- Here.

01:39:02.499 --> 01:39:04.874
There's an open boxcar. See it?

01:39:05.332 --> 01:39:06.374
Where?

01:39:06.499 --> 01:39:10.499
There's a red boxcar right here.
Red boxcar. See it?

01:39:11.416 --> 01:39:13.666
- Yes!
- Okay, go!

01:40:48.582 --> 01:40:51.249
This is gonna be so weird.

01:41:27.582 --> 01:41:29.790
<i>Down by the river</i>

01:41:29.915 --> 01:41:32.707
<i>It don't matter which river</i>

01:41:32.832 --> 01:41:35.290
<i>They're all going somewhere</i>

01:41:35.415 --> 01:41:38.082
<i>Well, just as long
as you're looking for me</i>

01:41:38.207 --> 01:41:40.915
<i>Well, just as long
as you're looking for me</i>

01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:44.374
<i>Well, just as long
as you're looking for me</i>

01:41:46.499 --> 01:41:49.624
<i>Well, just as long
as you're looking for me</i>

01:41:49.749 --> 01:41:51.999
<i>I can be a good friend</i>

01:41:52.124 --> 01:41:54.790
<i>And I can be a good lover</i>

01:41:54.915 --> 01:41:58.165
<i>And I can be a good lover</i>

01:42:00.540 --> 01:42:03.124
<i>But I can't do both of them</i>

01:42:03.249 --> 01:42:06.790
<i>No, I can't do both</i>

01:42:07.499 --> 01:42:09.749
<i>I can hope</i>

01:42:11.665 --> 01:42:14.374
<i>Well, just as long
as you're looking for me</i>

01:42:14.499 --> 01:42:17.207
<i>Well, just as long
as you're looking for me</i>

01:42:17.332 --> 01:42:20.582
<i>Well, just as long
as you're looking for me</i>

01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:25.499
<i>Well, just as long
as you're looking for me</i>

01:42:25.624 --> 01:42:28.832
<i>Well, just as long
as you're looking for me</i>

01:42:50.874 --> 01:42:53.457
<i>Come and stand in the water</i>

01:42:53.582 --> 01:42:56.665
<i>Come and stand in the water</i>

01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:59.707
<i>Tell me that you don't care</i>

01:43:02.123 --> 01:43:04.373
<i>Shakin' and shiverin'</i>

01:43:04.498 --> 01:43:08.582
<i>Time is making jokes at my expense</i>

01:43:10.207 --> 01:43:12.873
<i>Well, I'm dancing in the riverbed</i>

01:43:12.998 --> 01:43:15.665
<i>Well, just as long
as you're looking for me</i>

01:43:15.790 --> 01:43:18.498
<i>Well, just as long
as you're looking for me</i>

01:43:18.623 --> 01:43:21.832
<i>Well, just as long
as you're looking for me</i>

01:43:24.165 --> 01:43:26.873
<i>Well, just as long
as you're looking for me</i>

01:43:26.998 --> 01:43:30.290
<i>Well, just as long
as you're looking for me</i>

01:43:55.082 --> 01:43:58.123
<i>They're all going somewhere</i>

01:44:28.498 --> 01:44:31.582
<i>They're all going somewhere</i>

01:45:11.248 --> 01:45:12.915
<i>Now you know everything</i>

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:16.582
<i>Did I scare you off, did I show too much?</i>

01:45:18.623 --> 01:45:24.123
<i>The future's unraveling,
I'm losing my sense of touch</i>

01:45:25.582 --> 01:45:29.665
<i>So I reach out in the dark</i>

01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:35.832
<i>I hope that you'll be there
to shine some light</i>

01:45:36.305 --> 01:45:42.217
