00:51.552 --> 00:53.752
I thought you wanted
a goblin dog, right?

00:53.754 --> 00:54.887
Do you see
the goblin dog truck?

00:54.889 --> 00:57.089
This is the place.
I am positive.

00:57.091 --> 00:59.525
You've been saying that
for the last 12 dimensions,

00:59.527 --> 01:00.659
and I'm hungry.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.561
I'm gonna go home
and make a sandwich.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.729
I think I found it!

01:03.731 --> 01:05.164
There it is.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.565
The goblin dog truck.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.569
That line is, like,
a million miles long.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.337
It's all good.

01:12.339 --> 01:14.406
My friend Kelly's
holding us a spot. Yo, Kelly!

01:16.242 --> 01:18.444
Oh, hey, Kelly.

01:18.446 --> 01:21.547
Yo, Star, come
stand by me, girl.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.348
Oh, my goodness.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.751
We got so much
catching up to do.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.786
Let's start doing it.
Not you, Marco.

01:27.788 --> 01:28.954
You can stand over here
and talk to Kelly.

01:28.956 --> 01:31.123
Hey, Kelly.

01:31.125 --> 01:34.393
Uh, have you been
waiting long?

01:34.395 --> 01:36.428
That's so cute.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.797
You guys are basically
like the same person.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.033
Yeah, but, uh,
are you sure

01:41.035 --> 01:43.535
you wanna wait
in this crazy line
for just a hot dog?

01:43.537 --> 01:45.938
It's not
just a hot dog.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.606
It's a goblin dog.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.908
Some would kill
for a goblin dog.

01:49.910 --> 01:54.246
Just like how I almost
killed you with that ax.

01:54.248 --> 01:57.316
Just to be clear, I'm
the one who threw that ax.

01:57.318 --> 02:00.752
I pulled myself out of
the ground for a goblin dog.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.788
I'm a bit tender.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.090
Oh, please, I had
a goblin dog

02:05.092 --> 02:07.659
- just last week,
and it was the bomb.

With Ms. Heinous gone,

St. O's is like a total
party school now.

02:24.111 --> 02:26.245
Did you guys see
that little man
playing the music?

02:26.247 --> 02:28.680
Marco, you're
ignoring Kelly.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.482
- Rude.
- Oh, sorry.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.751
Did you see that
little man playing music?

02:34.687 --> 02:36.288
Okay.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.690
I gotta have
a tall man, you know,

02:38.692 --> 02:41.693
'cause I like to float
like, five feet
off the ground,

02:41.695 --> 02:43.362
so it's like,
I'm 4'6",

02:43.364 --> 02:45.864
but with six-inch heels,
you know what I'm saying?

02:45.866 --> 02:48.867
I mean, sometimes it feels
like they're the kids

02:48.869 --> 02:50.869
and I'm the parent,
you know?

02:53.373 --> 02:56.375
Whoa! You got another
one of those? I'm starving.

02:58.811 --> 03:00.646
You gotta be
kidding me.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.214
- What the...
- All right, kiddies.

03:02.216 --> 03:06.718
You're just moments away
from maximum mouth-ertainment.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.389
So stay cool in a hot
goblin dog T-shirt.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.191
Me, me!

03:12.193 --> 03:14.726
In my mouth.
I want it in my mouth.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.161
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

03:16.163 --> 03:17.563
- You work here?
- Yes.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.698
We've been waiting forever.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.967
- How do we get
a goblin dog?
- You wait in line.

03:21.969 --> 03:25.871
And can you tell me
how to get in that
short line over there?

03:25.873 --> 03:28.373
Oh, that's the VIP line.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.808
It's my boss' idea.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.743
How do we get
to the VIP line?

03:31.745 --> 03:34.913
Well, it's pretty
exclusive,

03:34.915 --> 03:39.184
but I could s-n-e-a-k
you guys in.

03:39.186 --> 03:40.852
Oh, you know what?

03:40.854 --> 03:42.354
I'm gonna go with
no, thank you.

03:42.356 --> 03:45.824
What? He just offered
to sneak us in.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.893
Oh, what? I thought
he spelled something out.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.328
That's my bad.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.564
Welcome to
the VIP line!

03:55.335 --> 03:59.938
Okay. Who's ready to buy
some goblin dog products?

03:59.940 --> 04:01.940
That's okay. We just
want the hot dog.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.309
You're in the VIP line.
That stands for...

04:07.914 --> 04:10.215
Buy the products,
stay in the line,

04:10.217 --> 04:12.618
- get the dogs.
- I don't have any money.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.186
Oh, I think
I got some.

04:14.188 --> 04:15.754
Check in my back
pocket, girl.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.557
Oh, uh-uh. No, I think
that's my keys.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.125
Oh, I found it.

04:20.127 --> 04:24.029
Uh, 27 cents
and two pistachio shells.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.597
I got some cash.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.733
Marco, how much money is that?

04:27.735 --> 04:30.202
- Like 650 bucks.
- Yep, that'll do it.

04:30.204 --> 04:32.804
This will get you
the executive package.

04:32.806 --> 04:35.741
Man, this goblin dog stuff
is ridiculous.

04:35.743 --> 04:38.610
Yeah, you dropped a ton
of cash on all this swag.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.747
No, I got us into
the right line.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.415
Oh, my gosh. Look.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.751
We're next!

04:45.753 --> 04:47.419
Four goblin dogs, please.

04:47.421 --> 04:51.290
Oh, you have to wait
in that line now.

04:52.925 --> 04:54.793
How many lines
are there?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.795
Oh, it's all one line.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.797
There's just a lot of them,
so after that line,

04:58.799 --> 05:00.399
you'll go to that line.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.800
Then that line,
then that line,

05:01.802 --> 05:04.803
then that line,
then that line,

05:04.805 --> 05:06.905
then it hooks back
like a dog's leg,

05:06.907 --> 05:08.674
then you gotta
take a number.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.676
from a little number
ticket pulley thingy.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.844
Okay, I'd like to speak
to the manager, please.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.113
Certainly, sir.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.915
Yes?

05:16.917 --> 05:18.650
What's the deal, man?

05:18.652 --> 05:21.420
We waited six hours
and bought all your stuff.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.088
I'm sorry, sir.

05:23.090 --> 05:26.858
- Did you say you've been
waiting for six hours?
- Yes.

05:26.860 --> 05:30.362
Well, some of these folks
have been waiting years.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.863
ALL: Years?!

05:31.865 --> 05:37.102
Years!!

05:38.805 --> 05:39.805
So what did
my manager say?

05:39.807 --> 05:41.840
ALL: You're the manager!

05:41.842 --> 05:43.809
You know what?
Forget this, okay?

05:43.811 --> 05:46.945
- I'm not waiting years
just to try a goblin dog.
- What?

05:46.947 --> 05:50.849
Ponyhead, I thought you said
you had a goblin dog before.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.318
Well, as it were, uh...

05:53.320 --> 05:56.221
Have you had a goblin dog
or not, Ponyhead?

05:56.223 --> 05:57.956
Uh, I don't know.

05:57.958 --> 06:01.059
Who can tell?
Like... maybe not.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.362
- I'm done.
- Marco, come on.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.030
Ponyhead didn't mean bad.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.965
She's just a liar.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.734
( angry muttering )

06:08.736 --> 06:10.702
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.704
Wait? That's all
we've been doing.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.473
I'm sweaty,
I'm hungry,

06:14.475 --> 06:17.309
and on top of everything,
you lied about goblin dogs.

06:17.311 --> 06:19.911
Look, Marco,
I mean,

06:19.913 --> 06:21.813
all of these people
have lied.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.915
She's right.
I lied, too.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.585
I'm not the one who
threw this ax at you.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.887
Hi. My name's Stan.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.355
ALL: Hi, Stan.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.357
I'm also a liar.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.192
I told my wife
this was a mink coat.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.595
It's just my body.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.230
My glasses are fake.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.332
Ooh, it feels good
to let that out.

06:40.334 --> 06:41.500
These aren't my teeth.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.435
Look, we've all lied,

06:43.437 --> 06:46.071
and lying is not cool.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.240
But there's only
one person here

06:48.242 --> 06:50.075
who has lied to
all of us.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.010
Yeah. Ponyhead.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.378
ALL: Yeah!

06:53.380 --> 06:55.514
No. No, no, no.
That guy.

06:56.916 --> 07:00.285
Oh, yeah.
He did lie to all of us.

07:00.287 --> 07:02.521
- Get him!
- ( all yelling )

07:02.523 --> 07:05.290
You're gonna lose
your place in line.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.263
Look out, Marco.

07:18.971 --> 07:20.205
Oh, no!

07:20.207 --> 07:21.840
All right, Ponyhead.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.044
He's getting away.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.247
We lost him.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.649
Oh, no, we certainly
did not.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.884
Grab on, turd.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.219
I'm not sure
I like you calling...

07:34.221 --> 07:36.855
Summoning cloudy charm.

07:43.329 --> 07:45.130
Magnificence marshmallow mush!

07:51.337 --> 07:52.604
( groans )

07:52.606 --> 07:55.173
Okay, Roy, now get out
the goblin dogs.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.108
Okay, you got me,
severed horse head.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.244
- Goblin dogs aren't real.
- What?

07:59.246 --> 08:02.180
It's a ruse.
I took you for everything.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.849
Come on, you guys.
Let's just go.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.984
Look, kids, you can
have your money back.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.153
You know what?

08:08.155 --> 08:11.022
- Keep it.
- Uh, Marco,
that was 650 bucks.

08:11.024 --> 08:15.093
Yeah. Well, now,
every time he sees my $650,

08:15.095 --> 08:17.929
he'll remember the three kids
whose dreams he wrecked.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.699
No, I'll just spend the money.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.300
He's right, Marco.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.002
We'll take the money,
okay, thanks.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.338
No, Star, we're going home.

08:27.807 --> 08:30.008
( giggling )

08:30.010 --> 08:33.111
( maniacal laughter )

08:33.113 --> 08:35.213
What the...

08:37.316 --> 08:39.150
- Star.
- ( laughter continues )

08:39.152 --> 08:40.018
You've done it.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.120
Ready when you are, Star.

08:42.122 --> 08:46.725
No. You earned
the goblin dog.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.060
What are you
talking about?

08:49.062 --> 08:51.329
Goblin dogs are real.
I had one before.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.365
- Kelly?
- Oh, we thought you died.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.833
MARCO: What?

08:54.835 --> 08:56.067
No, we didn't.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.702
Oh, okay, well,
I'm sorry.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.205
I thought she did die,
so excuse me.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.140
Wait. You've had
a goblin dog?

09:02.142 --> 09:03.074
Got it from Roy.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.477
So goblin dogs
are real?

09:05.479 --> 09:08.046
They are.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.081
Yes.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.683
This was all
some kind of trick.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.485
Not a trick.

09:13.487 --> 09:15.921
A goblin dog must
choose its master

09:15.923 --> 09:17.556
through trial,
and today,

09:17.558 --> 09:20.091
the goblin dog
chooses you.

09:21.761 --> 09:24.062
ALL: Wow!

09:28.167 --> 09:30.068
Behold!

09:31.938 --> 09:33.705
Oh, my gosh!

09:33.707 --> 09:35.106
( all exclaiming )

09:35.108 --> 09:37.108
Those aren't goblin dogs.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.655
These are goblin dogs.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.926
Oh, yeah!
Here, Pony.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.661
Bon apetit.

10:02.301 --> 10:05.136
This tastes like
a normal hot dog.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.138
It's basic
but it's good.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.441
Hm. Yeah.
I guess I was expecting...

10:09.443 --> 10:11.643
( gasps )

10:14.747 --> 10:16.848
Goblin dogs!

10:36.268 --> 10:37.302
That was amazing!

10:37.304 --> 10:39.337
I gotta give it
to you, Ponyhead.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.339
Those hot dogs
were pretty good.

10:41.341 --> 10:44.142
Oh, well, you know,
the best for my besties,

10:44.144 --> 10:45.510
and whatever,
all that kind of stuff.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.312
But, you guys,
on the real,

10:47.314 --> 10:49.147
I am so done
with this place.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.782
I'm ready to hoof it.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.985
Oh, no, you can't
say that. No.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.287
Roy makes me go through
this every time.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.523
Why are those goblin dogs
so good?

10:58.525 --> 11:00.992
Hey, Kelly, it's been
really great talking to you.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.328
Yeah, man, it was really
cool hangin' out with you, too.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.263
- What?!
- Oh, hey, I'm Tad.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.598
I'm Kelly's
boyfriend.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.199
You've been there
this whole time?

11:08.201 --> 11:10.201
Yeah, I don't really
eat hot dogs.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.570
I'm a vegan and stuff.
But, you know, I like
to hang out.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.109
( loud rumbling )

11:31.290 --> 11:32.857
( groaning )

11:32.859 --> 11:35.060
I don't even
understand, girls.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.130
This thing is impossible
to control... ( screaming )

11:46.338 --> 11:49.274
Why won't you work?
Hm?

11:51.210 --> 11:53.478
You can talk?

11:54.914 --> 11:56.981
Tell me your secrets.

11:58.517 --> 12:00.418
Star Butterfly?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.520
But I don't want
to see Star Butterfly.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.322
She doesn't have
a wand anymore.

12:05.691 --> 12:07.425
Oh, you're right.

12:07.427 --> 12:11.496
She doesn't need a wand
for me to steal her wisdom.

12:11.498 --> 12:14.432
Girls, pack your things.

12:14.434 --> 12:17.902
It's time to catch
a butterfly!

12:20.372 --> 12:23.775
( groaning )

12:23.777 --> 12:26.444
I'm not good at
these new spells.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.114
Why can't I just stick with
a normal blast?

12:29.116 --> 12:32.250
Because there are
other spells in your book.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.885
Yeah, but...

12:33.887 --> 12:36.020
Oh, Star. Look.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.022
This one's got pictures.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.290
Can we do it?

12:39.292 --> 12:41.025
That's got
a lot of steps.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.128
Star, can you just
do the spell, please?

12:43.130 --> 12:45.029
This book is so heavy.

12:45.031 --> 12:48.333
Ugh! All right.
( groaning )

12:51.971 --> 12:53.271
What do I gotta do?

12:53.273 --> 12:54.706
Start with the first one.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.910
Mmm, close enough.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.979
I guess.
Now how about this one?

13:02.481 --> 13:04.949
Okay, see, to me,

13:04.951 --> 13:09.120
it looks like you're
gonna wanna get both arms up,

13:09.122 --> 13:11.389
like way up
together.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.458
More.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.960
Up and out, Star.
Look at me.

13:15.962 --> 13:16.961
Huh?

13:16.963 --> 13:19.097
All the way up.
Pointing at 11:00.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.800
Earth 11:00
or Mewni 11:00?

13:22.835 --> 13:24.836
They're the same, Star.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.504
Ugh, this is impossible.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.107
Look, I know how
to cast a spell, okay?

13:29.109 --> 13:30.441
Twirl, twirl, twirl,

13:30.443 --> 13:31.976
helicopter arms,
helicopter arms.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.745
Warnicorn stampede!

13:35.281 --> 13:37.315
See, I did it.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.083
But, Star,

13:39.085 --> 13:41.686
that's a single warnicorn.

13:41.688 --> 13:44.489
A stampede is
many warnicorns.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.457
( laughs )
I think somebody

13:46.459 --> 13:48.359
needs to get back to
studying her spell book.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.195
Help.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.763
You know what, Glossaryck?

13:51.765 --> 13:54.199
I'm done with
the book for today.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.334
Come on, Marco.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.536
Let's go have fun
with our friends.

13:58.538 --> 14:02.507
Oh.
I thought we were friends.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.375
What? Oh, no, no, no, no.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.611
That's not what I meant.
We're friends.

14:06.613 --> 14:09.347
I just don't have
fun with you.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.649
But that is so fine,
'cause it's not like

14:11.651 --> 14:13.218
you like having
fun, right?

14:13.220 --> 14:16.154
Obviously. It's like
you're alone all the time.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.189
Lonely people can be cool,
like you.

14:18.191 --> 14:21.726
You're like a wise old hermit.

14:21.728 --> 14:26.564
Or like a wise old monk.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.000
Or... or a...

14:29.002 --> 14:30.735
like, I don't really know
what you are...

14:30.737 --> 14:32.837
Wow.
Say no more.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.906
I know when I'm not wanted.

14:34.908 --> 14:36.207
No, no, no.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.809
I won't be bothering you
ever again.

14:37.811 --> 14:40.478
Oh, my gosh.
I am so sorry, Glossaryck.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.846
Of course you're
our friend.

14:41.848 --> 14:43.748
Uh, is he though?

14:43.750 --> 14:46.251
All this guy has
ever done for us

14:46.253 --> 14:48.253
is hand out weird riddles
and eat pudding.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.989
Don't you talk like that
about our friend, Marco.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.056
We have to
make it up to him.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.359
All right. Look,

14:54.361 --> 14:56.160
my Uncle Enrique
hid in a box for
three days once.

14:56.162 --> 14:57.996
I know how
to handle this.

14:59.765 --> 15:02.567
We can never be together,
Isobel.

15:02.569 --> 15:06.504
We're from two
different worlds.

15:07.706 --> 15:09.474
( screeching )

15:11.410 --> 15:15.914
Society will never
accept us!

15:15.916 --> 15:18.516
See? Isn't this fun?

15:18.518 --> 15:21.019
Just three good friends
watching a movie together.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.787
'Cause that's what
good friends do.

15:22.789 --> 15:25.924
Marco, please tell Star
we are not talking.

15:25.926 --> 15:29.560
Star, Glossaryck said
he's still not talking.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.296
Glossaryck, can you be nice

15:31.298 --> 15:33.431
and pass this popcorn-candy
mix to Star?

15:33.433 --> 15:34.933
Hm, let me think.

15:34.935 --> 15:37.602
- No, but I will
have these.
- Hey!

15:37.604 --> 15:39.437
Oh, Boom Nuggets.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.272
I know where
you're going.

15:42.641 --> 15:44.976
( grumbles )

15:44.978 --> 15:47.211
Hey, no big deal.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.113
- I'll just make us
some more snacks.
- No, wait!

15:49.115 --> 15:51.215
Cotton candy cloud!

15:51.217 --> 15:53.451
That worked out better...

15:57.222 --> 15:59.924
You know, it might not kill you
to study a bit more.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.726
Don't you start, too, Marco.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.661
Glossaryck, you'll miss
the whole movie

16:03.663 --> 16:05.296
if you stay in there.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.497
I thought you liked
romantic comedies.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.566
Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.001
I've seen this one before.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.970
And the squid lady
dies in the end.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.372
( all groaning )

16:19.912 --> 16:21.646
( screeching )

16:24.183 --> 16:25.483
I can't hold her back
much longer.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.185
Glossaryck, help me.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.354
Marco, could you do me
a favor and tell Star

16:29.356 --> 16:32.523
she should ask one of
her Earth friends to help out?

16:32.525 --> 16:33.992
( burps )

16:33.994 --> 16:36.995
You can stop, Marco.
He called our bluff.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.963
( screeches )

16:38.965 --> 16:40.598
- Stop, Marco.
- Oh, sorry.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.569
This is the most disgusting
dumpster in town.

16:46.038 --> 16:48.539
The smell will get him
out of the box.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.109
All right. We're
getting Glossaryck back.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.952
Glossaryck!

17:08.227 --> 17:09.560
What the...

17:15.167 --> 17:17.368
Ludo?!
You're back?

17:17.370 --> 17:18.803
Ludo's back!

17:18.805 --> 17:20.338
Yes, I am.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.040
I tossed you
into the abyss.

17:22.042 --> 17:23.341
She tossed you
into the abyss.

17:23.343 --> 17:24.709
Yes, you did.

17:26.011 --> 17:27.812
- What?
- Huh?

17:27.814 --> 17:30.815
- BOTH: You have a wand?
- You both have wands.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.751
Okay, seriously, Marco,
that's getting annoying.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.553
Actually, he's right.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.890
Star Butterfly,
you're coming with me!

17:43.495 --> 17:44.896
Rainbow fist punch!

17:47.499 --> 17:48.566
What?

17:48.568 --> 17:50.268
Ha ha!

17:50.270 --> 17:52.437
That's your rainbow punch?

18:00.345 --> 18:01.646
Heart attack!

18:04.450 --> 18:07.585
This is the worst
wand fight I've ever seen.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.588
Oh, no, I don't
have time for this.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.658
Hey, we aren't done.
Come back here.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.667
Seriously?

18:25.204 --> 18:27.271
( car alarm blares )

18:41.420 --> 18:42.487
Nice.

18:49.261 --> 18:51.496
Star, the lid.
It isn't holding.

18:52.731 --> 18:53.798
Glossaryck!

18:59.638 --> 19:00.838
Oh, no!
Glossaryck!

19:00.840 --> 19:02.707
No!

19:07.980 --> 19:11.516
Now, Princess,
I give you a choice.

19:11.518 --> 19:14.785
Come with me or die.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.821
Warnicorn stampede!

19:24.363 --> 19:26.697
Fine. Have it your way.

19:26.699 --> 19:29.667
It's going to be
pretty hard to miss from here.

19:29.669 --> 19:30.768
Star!

19:38.710 --> 19:40.344
Om!

19:40.346 --> 19:42.580
- Glossaryck?
- ( whistles )

19:56.895 --> 19:58.696
What? A book.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.066
Now, read.

20:12.377 --> 20:15.580
Warnicorn stampede!

20:21.687 --> 20:23.788
What is that?

20:32.598 --> 20:34.265
- Oh.
- You did it!

20:34.267 --> 20:35.933
That was so cool.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.835
Yeah, it was.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.770
And all I had to do
was read from the book.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.839
Well, my work here
is done.

20:43.375 --> 20:44.942
Glossaryck.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.447
I'm sorry
we hurt your feelings.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.082
Oh, you didn't
hurt my feelings.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.950
I have no feelings.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.052
It was all part
of the plan.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.054
What do you mean,
part of the plan?

20:57.056 --> 21:00.558
Yeah, why'd you lock yourself
in the donut box then?

21:00.560 --> 21:02.460
I went into that box
on purpose,

21:02.462 --> 21:03.928
because I needed
to get to that candy.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.796
Oh! Wait, why?

21:05.798 --> 21:09.634
Well, how would you rocket
yourself from a trash compactor?

21:09.636 --> 21:11.435
What?
I don't know.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.804
Marco, Marco, I had to be
in that donut box,

21:13.806 --> 21:15.573
so I could land
at Ludo's feet

21:15.575 --> 21:17.308
to trip him up
and save the day.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.943
Wait, wait.
So you're saying

21:18.945 --> 21:20.311
you did all that on--

21:20.313 --> 21:22.947
Boom Nuggets.
( laughs )

21:22.949 --> 21:25.016
( sighs )
Fine.

21:28.754 --> 21:32.790
( maniacal laughter )

21:32.792 --> 21:35.459
Guess what.

21:36.828 --> 21:38.963
There's a book.
