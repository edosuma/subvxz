Well, we are here today

12:42.137 --> 12:44.640

Let's kick things off
with the recipient of our very first

12:49.311 --> 12:50.938

- Woo-woo!

13:04.117 --> 13:06.119
- Um, thanks, Coach.

13:07.204 --> 13:08.413
I'm gonna be honest,

13:09.665 --> 13:12.876
I felt conflicted when Coach
told me I was getting this

13:13.627 --> 13:18.423
because we all know the Bravery Award
basically means... the Gay Award.

13:20.467 --> 13:24.096
And I didn't know how I felt
about accepting the Gay Award.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.183
But then I spoke to a friend of mine,

13:28.851 --> 13:32.479
someone way smarter and cooler than me,

13:32.479 --> 13:36.191
and he made me realize
I feel pretty damn good

13:36.191 --> 13:37.860
about accepting the Gay Award.

13:38.944 --> 13:40.946
When I first moved
to Creekwood a year ago,

13:40.946 --> 13:43.156
I didn't know a single gay person.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.951
And I was so scared to tell anyone.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.580
But then I met
this incredible group of people,

13:49.580 --> 13:51.832
including the best friend
a guy could ask for,

13:51.832 --> 13:54.459
the kind that remembers
your friend-aversary.

13:55.794 --> 13:59.631
I found the best girlfriend
a confused gay kid could ask for.

14:00.424 --> 14:04.428
She made me feel totally safe
when I needed it most.

14:08.473 --> 14:09.766
I also fell in love

14:11.143 --> 14:12.477
with an amazing guy

14:13.687 --> 14:16.398
who was patient, and, and wise,

14:16.398 --> 14:20.027
and... pushed me to be
the very best version of myself.

14:21.361 --> 14:25.574
These people... showed me
what it meant to be brave.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.994
I, I used to think it meant that
you weren't scared of anything,

14:28.994 --> 14:30.746
but now I realize that

14:30.746 --> 14:34.625
being brave means that
you aren't afraid... to be scared.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.461
It means that you embrace the scary

14:38.420 --> 14:40.088
because a lot of the times,

14:40.088 --> 14:42.382
the scariest things are
also the most important.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.385
Like... admitting who you are,

14:46.720 --> 14:48.180

14:52.267 --> 14:56.271
