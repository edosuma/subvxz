WEBVTT

00:48.935 --> 00:52.368
That's enough! Get away from her!

01:03.650 --> 01:05.348
Grandma.

01:09.887 --> 01:11.820
It's okay.

01:13.158 --> 01:15.155
We're running out of time.

01:16.361 --> 01:19.960
Time? I tried to run...

01:20.300 --> 01:24.035
but I c... I couldn't.

01:24.135 --> 01:27.536
The people have to be protected.

01:29.541 --> 01:32.061
It's your turn now.

01:35.664 --> 01:37.952
This is the only way.

01:48.827 --> 01:51.457
I'm so sorry.

01:52.997 --> 01:55.263
I love you.

02:56.126 --> 02:59.096
As the moon grows over the coming days...

03:00.696 --> 03:05.354
may the tide of its light
illuminate your path...

03:06.002 --> 03:10.523
so that you may fulfill
your destiny, my child.

05:02.550 --> 05:05.387
Hey there, Danny. Why ain't you in school?

05:05.487 --> 05:07.656
And where's that cute girlfriend
of yours this morning?

05:07.756 --> 05:11.892
She's probably on her way to school.
What's going on? What's all this?

05:11.992 --> 05:15.362
Somebody got killed down by the river,
looks like, by the old Wolf Lady's place.

05:15.462 --> 05:19.165
Ms. Winfield?
Has anybody gone to check up on her?

05:19.265 --> 05:22.298
No. Sheriff ain't letting
no one down thataway.

05:23.304 --> 05:26.407
Maybe he'll let you in.
That's your girl's grandma, ain't she?

05:26.507 --> 05:28.008
Yeah, she is.

05:28.108 --> 05:31.178
Why don't you go see if you
can find something out for us?

05:31.278 --> 05:34.997
- Will do.
- Bye.

05:49.163 --> 05:52.033
Adam, looks pretty clean-cut to me.

05:52.433 --> 05:54.330
Yeah.

05:54.430 --> 05:57.338
I'll never understand how taking
your own life makes things better.

05:57.538 --> 06:00.139
Does anybody need a reason anymore?

06:00.239 --> 06:03.463
No, I guess not. You check the cabin?

06:03.643 --> 06:06.011
No signs of anything.

06:06.111 --> 06:09.949
- Vic, you find anything?
- Nothing of any use.

06:10.049 --> 06:12.714
Wolf Lady did this to herself.

06:14.954 --> 06:17.888
Oh, shit. The boyfriend
of the granddaughter.

06:19.559 --> 06:21.494
- Sheriff, what's going on, man?
- Danny...

06:21.594 --> 06:24.471
- Where's Ms. Winfield?
- You can't be here. Calm down.

06:24.571 --> 06:27.482
This is Sammy's grandmother's house!
Where is she?

06:27.582 --> 06:29.624
Listen to me.

06:29.724 --> 06:31.976
Where is Samantha now?

06:32.404 --> 06:33.740
She's at school.

06:33.840 --> 06:37.779
All right. Do you know if Ms. Winfield
had any other relatives besides Samantha?

06:37.879 --> 06:41.096
You know Sammy's her only relative left.

06:41.446 --> 06:42.881
All right, listen to me.

06:42.981 --> 06:45.771
I need you to get ahold of Samantha
right now. Can you do that for me?

06:45.871 --> 06:48.186
Can you tell me what's going on first?
Who's that?

06:48.286 --> 06:50.155
- Henry, I need you to handle this.
- I got it.

06:50.255 --> 06:52.353
Danny, come on.
Let me just talk to you over here.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.893
- Henry's gonna talk to you.
- Henry, man! This is me, Henry!

06:54.993 --> 06:56.579
Let me talk to you over here. Come on.

06:56.679 --> 06:59.864
Let me just talk to you.
Let me just talk to you over here, okay?

06:59.964 --> 07:03.102
I need you to get ahold
of Samantha for me.

07:03.202 --> 07:06.735
This is some bullshit.
Can you tell me what's going on, Henry?

07:09.308 --> 07:11.773
She's dead, isn't she?

07:12.743 --> 07:15.793
- Yeah.
- Shit.

07:28.093 --> 07:31.222
- Anything for you, Sheriff?
- Just the same old, Mildred. Thank you.

07:31.322 --> 07:34.867
- Yes, sir. Henry?
- What you got cooking for us, Mildred?

07:34.967 --> 07:39.663
For you, Henry, I got your favorite on
the stove with a little extra everything.

07:42.705 --> 07:45.375
You gonna tell us what happened, Sheriff?

07:45.475 --> 07:47.311
Well...

07:48.811 --> 07:51.915
it seems old Ms. Winfield
took her own life.

07:52.372 --> 07:55.753
Damn. That there's a crying shame.

07:55.853 --> 07:59.724
Yeah, it's a real shame.
Doesn't make any sense.

07:59.824 --> 08:02.927
She was a strange old coot, though,

08:03.027 --> 08:06.763
the Wolf Lady, always keeping to herself.

08:07.263 --> 08:10.117
That ain't right. No, sir.

08:10.217 --> 08:12.469
That's it, folks.

08:12.569 --> 08:14.735
Life goes on.

08:15.773 --> 08:19.842
All right, then, Sheriff.
Now you... you stay safe out there.

08:19.942 --> 08:22.980
There's some crazy people
in this crazy old world.

08:23.080 --> 08:26.917
- That's for sure.
- None crazier than you, Benson.

08:27.717 --> 08:32.549
Yeah, says you. That's why you
just a deputy. You ain't no Sheriff.

09:05.989 --> 09:09.965
Sammy! Open up! You in there?

09:10.065 --> 09:12.321
Sammy, you in there?

09:17.098 --> 09:18.964
Sammy?

09:26.274 --> 09:29.845
<i>Hi. You've reached Sammy.
Leave me a message.</i>

09:29.945 --> 09:33.247
Babe, it's me. It's important.
Give me a call back, okay?

09:33.347 --> 09:36.787
I went by campus. I didn't see
your car anywhere. Call me.

09:45.744 --> 09:48.224
- Give me the good news, Abbey.
- Old man Parsons called again.

09:48.324 --> 09:50.164
I'm not dismissing the ticket!

09:50.264 --> 09:53.000
Another domestic dispute
at Jared and Sara's.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.656
Tell them to get a marriage counselor.

10:11.452 --> 10:15.122
I got a call from that Danny kid.
Said he can't find his girlfriend anywhere.

10:15.222 --> 10:17.492
Shit. All right, tell him to keep looking.

10:17.592 --> 10:22.158
- Should I whip up a new batch of brew?
- Day is still young. Keep it coming.

10:22.597 --> 10:25.828
- Thank you.
- You betcha.

11:28.862 --> 11:31.607
<i>That's too bad.</i>

11:38.704 --> 11:39.839
Hey.

11:39.939 --> 11:44.542
Adam, I need you to watch the kids
for the next two weeks.

11:45.042 --> 11:46.945
I got a deal to close out of town,

11:47.045 --> 11:50.650
and the nanny has come down
with some sort of foreign disease thing.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.852
- <i>Can you do this?</i>
- Yeah.

11:52.952 --> 11:56.065
Easy! Off the bed! Off the bed right now!

11:56.165 --> 11:59.861
- You know the kids always come first.
- What are you trying to say?

12:00.291 --> 12:03.653
I'm not saying anything.
I'm just saying this is their home.

12:03.753 --> 12:06.164
No, this is their home.

12:06.264 --> 12:10.559
- Denise, I'm not arguing with you.
- But you're arguing right now. Easy!

12:10.836 --> 12:15.141
I... Okay, you know what? Send me their
flight information, and I'll pick 'em up.

12:15.541 --> 12:17.785
You're impossible, Adam.

12:18.811 --> 12:21.108
And you are a bitch.

12:54.579 --> 12:56.304
Yo...

12:56.404 --> 12:58.176
Danny boy.

12:58.276 --> 13:02.053
Where's Sammy?
Yeah, where's your girl, bro?

13:02.153 --> 13:03.954
Didn't see her in class today.

13:04.054 --> 13:07.758
Don't know. Think she's out of town.

13:08.658 --> 13:11.329
Wait, and she didn't tell you?

13:11.429 --> 13:13.849
She's banging some other dude, bro.

13:13.949 --> 13:16.746
Is that supposed to be funny?

13:18.535 --> 13:21.971
Danny, the Sheriff's
looking for her, right?

13:22.071 --> 13:24.241
I don't think he thinks she's missing.

13:24.341 --> 13:28.678
She probably just went with family
and forgot to tell you.

13:28.778 --> 13:30.613
Don't worry.

13:30.913 --> 13:35.034
Wait, wait, wait. That was Sammy's
grandmother that killed herself?

13:36.385 --> 13:39.389
That is some fucked-up shit, bro.

13:39.489 --> 13:43.126
Yo, Rita! Where's your cousin at?
When's she flying back in again?

13:43.226 --> 13:47.163
She's back in New York,
but she asked about you.

13:47.263 --> 13:52.035
- Do you think she likes me?
- She wanted to know if you were retarded.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.694
Fuck you. Fuck her.

13:56.063 --> 13:57.886
What are you doing? Not right here.

13:57.986 --> 14:00.943
Come on, big college man.
Don't you want me?

14:01.043 --> 14:03.286
I do.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.600
Did you hear that?

14:34.700 --> 14:36.078
Alex!

14:36.224 --> 14:40.178
Stop fucking around, man!
Get your own girl.

14:48.056 --> 14:50.754
Wait! Did you hear that?

14:51.159 --> 14:54.392
- Hear what?
- I heard something.

15:04.739 --> 15:07.675
Get the fuck off! Get it off! Get it off!

15:08.075 --> 15:09.778
What the fuck was that?

15:10.178 --> 15:12.463
Man, come on.

15:24.491 --> 15:28.012
- What the fuck was that?
- Fuck! No way, man!

15:28.112 --> 15:31.377
Rita, come here! Don't look! Come here!

15:34.335 --> 15:37.436
Hey, we gotta go. We gotta go now!

15:38.988 --> 15:40.153
Fuck.

15:59.609 --> 16:01.468
This better be good.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.728
Yeah, I'll be right there.

16:23.482 --> 16:26.161
So you and Danny are the only ones
that saw the wolf?

16:26.651 --> 16:28.315
- Yeah.
- Clear?

16:28.415 --> 16:30.118
Yes.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.929
You're not even gonna believe this.

16:37.029 --> 16:39.760
We got a fatality from a wolf attack.

16:40.365 --> 16:41.800
Anyone seen it since?

16:41.900 --> 16:45.366
Not a trace.
We got the state police on the way.

16:50.675 --> 16:53.146
Anyone tell me what happened?

16:53.246 --> 16:57.867
We heard a scream, ran to help,
saw Jason on the ground.

16:58.117 --> 16:59.953
We took a shot at it.

17:00.053 --> 17:03.856
- You hit it?
- I don't think so.

17:04.455 --> 17:06.468
How many y'all kids are out here?

17:06.568 --> 17:11.012
There are about 20, sir, counting Jason
and Rita, but they were in the woods.

17:11.112 --> 17:15.384
- How many wolves were there?
- Just one, sir.

17:16.334 --> 17:18.326
Just one wolf?

17:18.425 --> 17:20.901
Could have been more.

17:23.174 --> 17:25.836
Okay, sit tight.

17:32.550 --> 17:36.941
- What is it?
- I don't know. Seems strange.

17:37.321 --> 17:40.577
You got a fire, a lot of kids, noise.

17:40.677 --> 17:44.976
Pretty goddamn brave wolf, especially
considering that they hunt in packs.

17:45.076 --> 17:48.328
Yeah, and I don't like
how close this is to town.

17:49.201 --> 17:50.635
All right,

17:50.735 --> 17:53.755
let's try to find it, relocate it.
If we can't, we'll put it down.

17:53.855 --> 17:56.190
Why don't we just let
the state police handle it?

17:57.140 --> 17:59.712
Nah, it's a local intrusion.

17:59.812 --> 18:03.013
Get a volunteer group together.
We'll do it ourselves.

18:03.113 --> 18:05.512
All right, roger that.

18:08.169 --> 18:10.066
Danny.

18:15.159 --> 18:18.027
- You all right?
- Sure.

18:18.127 --> 18:19.935
Any word from your girlfriend?

18:22.265 --> 18:24.030
No.

18:25.101 --> 18:26.904
Okay.

18:27.604 --> 18:31.438
Well, we'll help you look for her
tomorrow. Get some rest.

18:35.478 --> 18:38.449
Come on. Savannah's not even in town.

18:38.549 --> 18:41.951
She's with her boyfriend in Vegas, okay?

18:42.051 --> 18:43.988
So everything is fine.

18:44.088 --> 18:48.890
I'm just hanging out at the house
by myself... studying.

18:48.990 --> 18:53.074
'Cause I want to get into
a good college like we talked about.

18:54.029 --> 18:58.815
No, there are no boys here,
so you don't have to worry.

19:02.821 --> 19:06.822
All right. Love you, too. Bye.

19:09.844 --> 19:12.186
It's party time.

19:55.022 --> 19:57.293
It's just you and me
with the whole place to ourselves?

19:57.393 --> 20:00.476
- It's just you and me.
- Body's on fleek.

20:44.971 --> 20:47.985
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

20:53.247 --> 20:56.557
- What the fuck was that?
- I don't know. Go find out.

21:11.564 --> 21:14.898
- What?
- It was just a cat.

21:17.970 --> 21:19.653
Help!

21:41.995 --> 21:44.063
I need your bloodhounds, Lance.

21:44.163 --> 21:47.662
No, you cannot bring Dennis.
The guy's nuttier than a bag of trail mix.

21:47.762 --> 21:50.297
Thank you very much.

21:50.397 --> 21:52.672
All right, everybody,
I appreciate you coming!

21:52.772 --> 21:56.342
The plan is to meet at sundown
at Mildred's coffee shop.

21:56.642 --> 21:59.611
We're gonna play this real safe
and do it by the numbers, all right?

21:59.711 --> 22:03.448
We expect nothing less from you, Sheriff.
We'll be waiting.

22:03.548 --> 22:07.245
I appreciate that. Thank you, everybody.

22:07.703 --> 22:09.938
All right, how we doing
on Ms. Winfield's granddaughter?

22:10.038 --> 22:11.517
No luck.

22:24.937 --> 22:28.035
Sammy! Sammy!

22:29.842 --> 22:33.578
Damn! That's why I need a goddamn key.

22:33.678 --> 22:35.443
Shit.

22:40.351 --> 22:41.749
Sammy!

22:43.688 --> 22:47.492
Come on, Sammy. Pick up the phone.

22:55.265 --> 22:57.586
Why don't you got your phone?

23:15.252 --> 23:18.288
<i>Sammy, it's Danny! Where the hell are you?</i>

23:19.588 --> 23:22.210
<i>Hey, girl! You didn't show up to class.</i>

23:22.560 --> 23:25.667
<i>Sammy, it's Grandmother.
I have a special surprise for you.</i>

23:25.897 --> 23:27.971
<i>Can you please come
and meet me at the house?</i>

23:28.071 --> 23:30.732
<i>Hurry, angel. I'll be waiting.</i>

24:15.044 --> 24:16.879
You scared the hell out of me.

24:17.379 --> 24:20.189
Sorry. Just trying
to tie up a few loose ends

24:20.299 --> 24:22.785
and see if I can figure out
why Miss Winfield killed herself.

24:23.385 --> 24:25.971
We been trying to figure out
if she's got any other next of kin

24:26.071 --> 24:30.092
besides her granddaughter,
who we can't locate.

24:30.192 --> 24:33.574
Granddaughter. That's interesting.

24:34.062 --> 24:35.663
So you knew her pretty well then?

24:35.763 --> 24:39.133
Sure. Everybody around here
knew the Wolf Lady.

24:39.233 --> 24:43.100
Living up here all alone, off the land.

24:48.043 --> 24:51.998
I mean, look at this thing. Supposedly
she killed it and stuffed it herself.

24:52.448 --> 24:55.380
Well, she clearly knew what she was doing.

24:56.752 --> 24:58.888
Hang on.

24:59.188 --> 25:00.936
Hey, Abbey, what's up?

25:01.036 --> 25:03.970
<i>Sheriff, we got a report of two deaths
and a wolf sight near Johnson's Creek. </i>

25:04.070 --> 25:07.925
- <i>Can you meet Henry there?</i>
- Send me the address. I'll be right there.

25:09.464 --> 25:12.033
Say, you still a wildlife expert
in your department?

25:12.133 --> 25:15.240
- That's what they tell me.
- You mind following me to a crime scene?

25:15.370 --> 25:16.934
Sure. Let's go.

25:21.376 --> 25:23.178
<i>Sheriff, any word on the wolf attacks?</i>

25:23.278 --> 25:25.618
<i>We got a lot of people
with a lot of questions over here.</i>

25:25.718 --> 25:29.497
No, I'm gonna need you guys to hold tight.
I'm checking out another lead right now.

25:33.120 --> 25:36.191
Well, bitch-slap me twice,
and kick me in the nuts.

25:36.291 --> 25:38.860
If it isn't another wolf attack.

25:39.610 --> 25:41.341
Got a bunch of tracks out front.

25:45.700 --> 25:48.903
I've never seen a wolf attack like this.

25:49.003 --> 25:51.034
It's uncommon...

25:51.573 --> 25:53.805
not unheard of.

25:54.942 --> 25:58.029
- Any ideas what might have provoked him?
- Countless things.

25:58.599 --> 26:01.215
Well, any theories
would be greatly appreciated.

26:01.315 --> 26:05.249
Food scarcity, territory, thirst.

26:05.349 --> 26:07.537
Could be anything.

26:07.987 --> 26:10.553
Is that an expert opinion?

26:11.458 --> 26:16.195
<i>Base, PF-3. Please advise, Doral County
requests assist on a possible 10-54.</i>

26:16.295 --> 26:19.865
PF-3 base, I'm 10-94 right now
with Doral County.

26:19.965 --> 26:24.104
We have two 10-54s.
Please alert Officer Scudder.

26:24.204 --> 26:26.828
<i>PF-3, 10-4.</i>

26:27.674 --> 26:30.710
You had another wolf attack
last night, didn't you?

26:31.110 --> 26:32.606
Yeah, it looks that way.

26:32.706 --> 26:35.698
There have been other attacks
I think you should be aware of.

26:36.448 --> 26:39.382
What the hell is going on here?

26:42.154 --> 26:45.305
Let's head back to the station
and you can fill me in.

26:50.295 --> 26:53.999
The first wolf attack happened
in Arcadia, 20 miles south of here.

26:54.299 --> 26:57.270
- Since you been keeping track of them?
- Since I've been concerned.

26:58.120 --> 27:01.474
Next one was halfway
between the two towns at Sproul Creek.

27:01.574 --> 27:04.577
And then there were attacks
here, here, and here.

27:04.677 --> 27:06.567
All these attacks happened when?

27:06.667 --> 27:10.115
Over the last few months,
over a dozen attacks.

27:10.215 --> 27:14.185
Well, I certainly think it's time
to exterminate the fuckers.

27:14.285 --> 27:16.722
Why wasn't I told about them?

27:16.822 --> 27:21.460
Out of your jurisdiction. I guess no one
thought it was cause for concern...

27:22.160 --> 27:25.898
so we didn't feel any reason
to alert your office.

27:26.764 --> 27:30.336
Now we've had wolves around these parts
for as long as I can remember.

27:30.436 --> 27:31.955
We've never had problems like this.

27:32.055 --> 27:35.239
You're used to seeing
canis rufus, the red wolf.

27:35.339 --> 27:37.207
It's like a coyote-wolf mix.

27:37.307 --> 27:40.110
It's a lot smaller than canis lupus,
the gray wolf,

27:40.210 --> 27:43.214
which on average is twice
as large as its cousin.

27:43.314 --> 27:47.392
So why are we seeing this gray wolf?
I'm confused.

27:47.492 --> 27:50.822
Wolves of any kind
are not common in this area.

27:50.922 --> 27:53.595
The red wolf may come up
from the south, but...

27:53.695 --> 27:56.457
the gray wolves have been
eradicated for decades,

27:56.627 --> 27:59.096
so really, we're not supposed
to be seeing these animals

27:59.196 --> 28:03.120
- in this neck of the woods at all.
- Yet here they are.

28:03.800 --> 28:06.469
All I know is that this used
to be their territory...

28:06.569 --> 28:09.606
before man hunted them to near extinction

28:09.706 --> 28:12.505
and wiped them out in the last century.

28:12.844 --> 28:15.113
So what are you saying?
They're coming back?

28:15.213 --> 28:19.049
I'm saying that what's happening
is unprecedented.

28:19.149 --> 28:21.951
Look, I'm no real expert,
but I've been doing some extra research,

28:22.051 --> 28:26.490
and I have reason to suspect that we are
dealing with a new breed of wolves.

28:26.590 --> 28:29.075
I'm sorry. A new breed?

28:29.175 --> 28:30.927
There's more to it than just that,

28:31.027 --> 28:34.630
but these wolves are exhibiting
characteristics that are uncommon,

28:34.730 --> 28:37.757
- traits that they should not be showing.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

28:37.857 --> 28:41.304
- No, I'm not.
- Hey, you know what?

28:41.904 --> 28:44.370
Maybe they're werewolves.

28:47.261 --> 28:51.158
Okay, so what do we do
about this new breed of yours?

28:51.278 --> 28:55.151
I don't know, Adam. Maybe you
should invest in some silver bullets.

28:55.251 --> 28:58.368
- Now that'd be cool.
- Why don't we focus...

28:58.468 --> 29:01.317
on getting them to stop killing people?

29:02.087 --> 29:04.723
'Cause that's all I really care about.

29:05.461 --> 29:08.701
All right, now look. This here is the
center point between all these towns,

29:08.801 --> 29:12.964
- so we should start looking here.
- That's dead space. No wolf sightings there.

29:13.064 --> 29:16.071
- You can't be sure of that.
- Mountains are steep and barren.

29:16.171 --> 29:19.740
There's not enough prey to attract
a predator at the highest level.

29:20.643 --> 29:23.823
Feel free to check it out if you like,
but I think you'd be wasting your time.

29:23.923 --> 29:27.349
All right, all right.
Where should we start looking then?

29:27.449 --> 29:30.237
I recommend you find a body
of water, stream, or a river

29:30.337 --> 29:32.252
within three miles outside of the towns

29:32.352 --> 29:35.791
with the last known sightings
of these animals.

29:35.891 --> 29:38.490
You'll find their dens nearby.

29:39.227 --> 29:41.296
And, Adam...

29:41.666 --> 29:45.610
I know you think you know this land
and the wildlife in it.

29:49.739 --> 29:52.103
Spit it out.

29:53.275 --> 29:56.184
The forest is a very big place.

30:20.601 --> 30:23.938
We're doing pretty damn good.
We got a good turnout.

30:24.038 --> 30:26.478
Our wolf's in trouble tonight.

30:31.445 --> 30:34.583
Benson! What the hell is that, man?

30:34.683 --> 30:37.618
What's that look like?
That's pretty spiffy?

30:37.718 --> 30:41.022
Give me that damn thing.
You're gonna burn down the whole forest!

30:41.122 --> 30:43.758
- Give me a break, Deputy!
- You believe this?

30:43.858 --> 30:46.057
Come on! What am I supposed to use?

30:46.157 --> 30:48.863
Am I supposed to use
the bottom of my shoe?

30:48.963 --> 30:52.362
My bad breath? My good looks?

30:54.100 --> 30:57.771
We're hunting a wolf. We're not storming
the beaches of Normandy.

30:57.871 --> 30:59.870
And I want that back when we're done.

30:59.970 --> 31:01.920
I'm gonna want my flamethrower
back when we done.

31:02.020 --> 31:04.005
Yeah, well, you can take
that up with the Sheriff,

31:04.105 --> 31:06.476
'cause it was up to me,
I'd lock your ass up just for having it.

31:06.576 --> 31:09.148
Yeah, that's too bad.
That's why you ain't the Sheriff.

31:09.248 --> 31:11.139
I'm gonna kill me something.

31:24.733 --> 31:27.102
Now you shut up, and listen.

31:27.251 --> 31:30.162
I don't want any drinking, no horseplay,

31:30.262 --> 31:32.507
and watch where you aim your weapons.

31:32.607 --> 31:35.839
You see something, you let everyone know.

31:38.578 --> 31:40.881
You should leave the wolf alone.

31:40.981 --> 31:43.675
It's only acting out of instinct.

31:45.018 --> 31:46.914
I didn't catch your name.

31:47.014 --> 31:48.953
Not important.

31:49.053 --> 31:50.998
I think it is.

31:51.098 --> 31:54.789
Becky, Becky Sanders.

31:57.330 --> 31:59.364
You must be new
around these parts, Ms. Sanders.

31:59.464 --> 32:02.601
I've been around, Sheriff,
long enough to know that we're the ones

32:02.701 --> 32:06.869
encroaching on the wolves' land,
and it's not our place to kill them.

32:09.107 --> 32:10.577
You may be right,

32:10.877 --> 32:13.827
but I can't have a wild animal
running around, hurting people, so...

32:13.927 --> 32:16.950
unfortunately we're gonna
have to put the animal down.

32:17.050 --> 32:19.685
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

32:20.135 --> 32:23.289
You're not gonna give me any troubles,
are you, Ms. Becky Sanders?

32:24.427 --> 32:28.157
I'm sure... you'll have
enough trouble without me.

32:31.428 --> 32:33.927
You have yourself a safe night.

32:44.376 --> 32:45.715
Hey, Henry.

32:45.815 --> 32:48.901
Do me a favor. Run a background check
on Becky Sanders when you get a chance.

32:49.001 --> 32:50.682
Copy that.

32:50.782 --> 32:53.137
All right, you all know why we're here.

32:53.917 --> 32:57.222
Three young people have been killed
by an unprovoked wolf,

32:57.822 --> 32:59.893
so it's our job...

32:59.993 --> 33:03.927
to hunt it, put it down
before it attacks anyone else.

33:04.027 --> 33:06.146
I don't want anyone getting hurt.

33:06.246 --> 33:10.629
You stick together,
and keep your eyes open. All right?

33:12.836 --> 33:15.065
Let's move it out.

33:20.843 --> 33:23.046
Come on, boy! Show 'em what you got!

33:23.846 --> 33:27.384
Tell you something, Henry,
we should have done this a long time ago.

33:27.684 --> 33:30.957
I told you and the Sheriff
about these wolves forever.

33:31.387 --> 33:33.491
Calm down, Benson. It's just a dog.

33:33.591 --> 33:36.259
No, sir. Something about 'em ain't right.

33:36.359 --> 33:38.729
No, sir. I been living
in these woods all my life.

33:38.829 --> 33:41.232
I know it's something ain't right
about 'em. No, sir.

33:41.332 --> 33:45.235
Maybe if you did a little less talking and
a little more hunting, you might bag one.

33:45.335 --> 33:49.821
You bet your sweet patootie on that.
I'm gonna kill me some wolves, Henry.

33:51.574 --> 33:54.629
- I can't believe we gave you a gun.
- I got one now, though.

33:54.729 --> 33:58.727
- Just shut up, Benson!
- I'm a dangerous man.

34:24.507 --> 34:26.420
Dog's done, Sheriff.

34:26.521 --> 34:29.545
There's wolves out there, all right.
He can smell 'em.

34:29.946 --> 34:32.411
These woods are thick.

34:42.690 --> 34:44.856
You hear that?

34:51.234 --> 34:54.971
We're getting close.
We should keep going a little longer.

34:55.071 --> 34:57.495
Let's just give him
five more minutes rest, boss.

35:00.676 --> 35:02.418
All right.

35:07.114 --> 35:11.015
What? What is it, boy? What is it?

35:18.126 --> 35:21.559
- They're over there. Over there.
- I think I see it.

35:25.968 --> 35:28.366
- I got a clean shot!
- Take it.

35:41.715 --> 35:44.137
I... I got him, Henry!

35:44.437 --> 35:47.217
I shot him clean, Henry.

35:49.357 --> 35:52.499
I think you got him. I think you got him.

36:06.974 --> 36:08.906
Hey, Sheriff, I want that tail.

36:32.632 --> 36:34.467
Henry, he's eating Cletus!

36:34.567 --> 36:36.292
Shoot it!

36:36.392 --> 36:39.882
I ain't got a shot! Who's got a shot?

36:42.409 --> 36:44.707
They're everywhere!

36:49.049 --> 36:51.046
Sumbitch!

37:41.265 --> 37:42.724
Yo!

37:45.069 --> 37:46.867
The wolves are backing off!

37:55.847 --> 37:57.610
Wait.

38:10.561 --> 38:13.059
What the fuck was that?

38:19.437 --> 38:22.302
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

38:30.481 --> 38:32.650
I need you to tell me
what happened here, Adam,

38:32.750 --> 38:35.220
or the state police are gonna
have to come in and take over.

38:35.935 --> 38:39.958
I don't want to do that,
but you got another dead body.

38:40.258 --> 38:43.123
I told you there was
something wrong with the wolves.

38:43.223 --> 38:47.044
Hey, Benson, Benson, give us a break.
Please just go over there. Please?

38:47.764 --> 38:50.637
That thing that came out
of nowhere wasn't a wolf.

38:50.737 --> 38:53.153
I don't know what it was.

38:53.253 --> 38:56.407
The wolves snuck up on us, and everything
just went to hell, and then this...

38:56.507 --> 38:59.703
zombie-like girl, she rescued us.

39:01.978 --> 39:03.914
That thing...

39:04.014 --> 39:07.952
that thing was a walking fucking corpse!
Right, Adam?

39:08.052 --> 39:11.454
I mean, seriously, she wasn't human.

39:11.554 --> 39:14.153
Tell you that much right now.

39:15.525 --> 39:18.227
So... you're saying that...

39:18.327 --> 39:23.095
this girl, zombie-corpse-like thing,
saved your lives?

39:23.799 --> 39:25.941
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

39:26.041 --> 39:28.591
Let's go find her then!

39:29.039 --> 39:33.076
Fuck that! Fuck that, Mr. State Policeman!

39:33.176 --> 39:36.512
You want to go get her, you go
out there and get her yourself.

39:37.012 --> 39:39.477
I'm staying right here.

39:40.781 --> 39:43.419
That bitch had demon eyes.

39:44.319 --> 39:46.712
Was kind of crexy, though.

39:46.812 --> 39:49.992
- Crexy?
- Creepy-sexy.

39:50.542 --> 39:52.406
Crexy.

39:54.064 --> 39:55.865
You done?

39:55.965 --> 39:57.696
Yeah.

40:04.305 --> 40:07.628
Look, I just need you to give me
some time to lock this down.

40:08.877 --> 40:11.212
If I need the State Police help,
I'll ask for it.

40:11.312 --> 40:14.843
Never had any problem with you guys
coming in and lending a hand. I just...

40:15.717 --> 40:19.530
I don't know. For my own sanity, I gotta
figure what the hell's going on out here.

40:21.222 --> 40:23.023
You know I got your back, Adam.

40:23.123 --> 40:26.990
The most I can give you is a few days.

41:05.265 --> 41:07.867
- Daddy!
- Hey! Hey.

41:08.527 --> 41:12.467
I missed you, guys! Come on.
Go put your stuff away.

41:14.542 --> 41:18.774
- I totally forgot they were coming.
- They called the station.

41:19.779 --> 41:22.982
They should not be here right now
with everything that's going on.

41:23.082 --> 41:26.552
I agree. You really think
she'd understand?

41:26.652 --> 41:29.303
Not even in a thousand years.

41:30.590 --> 41:33.360
Okay, I'll... I'll see you tomorrow.

41:33.460 --> 41:36.793
- So, how was the plane ride?
- I loved it.

41:37.163 --> 41:40.398
- I want my attorney!
- Shut up!

41:41.867 --> 41:44.404
When's the last time you saw her?

41:44.504 --> 41:46.672
You've already asked me that.

41:46.772 --> 41:49.079
That's right. I'm sorry.

41:49.179 --> 41:53.012
Man, are you guys putting up any bulletins
or anything so people could look for her?

41:53.112 --> 41:55.473
Danny, that's for the Sheriff to decide.

41:55.573 --> 41:58.667
Decide? What is there to decide, man?

41:58.767 --> 42:02.240
This is some bullshit, Henry!
They got wolves out there.

42:02.340 --> 42:05.291
Her grandmother's dead.
What if something bad happened to her?

42:05.391 --> 42:08.294
Look, I understand
where you're coming from, man,

42:08.394 --> 42:10.196
but you think you got problems?

42:10.296 --> 42:13.700
We got some crazy-ass shit
going on right now in this office.

42:13.800 --> 42:15.553
You know what, Henry?

42:15.653 --> 42:19.571
You know what, man? Just forget it.
Forget all of this shit.

42:19.871 --> 42:23.442
How long does she have to go missing
before y'all take this serious?

42:23.942 --> 42:28.181
The Sheriff said she used to run away
a lot when she was younger.

42:28.481 --> 42:31.780
Well, it's cool.

42:32.817 --> 42:34.688
Thanks for nothing, Henry.

42:50.367 --> 42:51.488
Sammy?

43:04.216 --> 43:08.219
Sammy! Oh, my God. Thank you. Sammy!

43:08.519 --> 43:11.623
Where have you been? You scared me.

43:12.323 --> 43:14.709
- What happened to you?
- I don't know.

43:14.809 --> 43:16.661
- We gotta call the Sheriff, okay?
- Don't.

43:16.761 --> 43:18.730
- What?
- I said don't!

43:19.330 --> 43:22.133
You're so cold and pale.

43:22.233 --> 43:24.197
Sit down.

43:24.784 --> 43:26.533
Blanket.

43:30.641 --> 43:33.376
Listen, you just relax, okay?

43:33.876 --> 43:37.344
Everything's gonna be okay. I'm here.

43:43.453 --> 43:45.685
What the hell?

43:47.190 --> 43:49.041
Sammy...

43:49.141 --> 43:51.390
where have you been?

43:56.565 --> 43:59.136
- You guys hungry?
- Yes.

43:59.236 --> 44:01.034
Okay.

44:01.771 --> 44:03.941
Come on, babe.

44:04.341 --> 44:06.777
Stay out of the street. Come on.

44:07.477 --> 44:08.711
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Hi.

44:08.811 --> 44:12.816
- Looks like you got your helpers today.
- Yeah, sure do. You say hi to George for me.

44:12.916 --> 44:16.014
Promise to be more careful
hunting those wolves.

44:19.722 --> 44:21.386
Yeah.

44:23.058 --> 44:25.457
Come on. Open it up.

44:29.464 --> 44:33.603
All right, there are no cookies
until you guys eat some real food.

44:33.703 --> 44:37.773
- That's the end of the discussion.
- But, Daddy, not all cookies are junk food.

44:37.873 --> 44:40.710
- Yes, they are.
- Say, I haven't seen you two in a while.

44:40.810 --> 44:42.846
Who's this big guy
you brought in here with you?

44:42.946 --> 44:46.811
He says he's our daddy,
but I've never seen him before.

44:47.517 --> 44:51.783
You okay? I heard what happened
out in the forest there.

44:52.021 --> 44:53.689
Yeah, I'm fine.

44:53.789 --> 44:57.029
You know, people are talking about these
wolves going on a rampage, killing folks

44:57.129 --> 44:59.162
like they're possessed or something.

44:59.262 --> 45:01.931
Well, that's nonsense.
They're just animals.

45:02.431 --> 45:05.529
- I hope you're right.
- Yeah, you know what?

45:06.169 --> 45:09.021
You still got that rib eye from last week?

45:09.771 --> 45:12.069
Do bears poop in the woods?

45:13.108 --> 45:15.012
Well, I'm gonna have that
with all the trimmings

45:15.112 --> 45:19.143
and whatever these knuckleheads want,
as long as they do not order cookies.

45:20.449 --> 45:22.920
You kids want to try
the chicken fingers with fries?

45:23.050 --> 45:25.019
- Hey, Mildred.
- Yeah, boss?

45:25.119 --> 45:28.869
- You cut your own meat here, right?
- Sure do. Why do you ask?

45:28.969 --> 45:31.067
How much does a whole slab weigh?

45:31.167 --> 45:34.930
- About 30, 35 pounds. Not sure.
- You think I could buy one from you?

45:35.030 --> 45:38.400
You want to eat that here,
or you want me to wrap it up to go?

45:38.700 --> 45:41.799
- You got it, boss.
- Thank you.

46:10.497 --> 46:11.977
I'll be right back.

46:55.006 --> 46:57.741
I'm sorry about your grandmother.

47:00.345 --> 47:03.482
- I need to go back to her house.
- For what?

47:03.582 --> 47:07.549
I need to find something,
something special.

47:10.457 --> 47:13.493
Okay. All right, well, let's go.

47:13.593 --> 47:15.961
- Not now.
- Then when?

47:16.061 --> 47:17.893
Sundown.

47:59.204 --> 48:03.976
No stake through the heart.
No incantations. Just two gunshot wounds.

48:04.176 --> 48:06.641
What are you doing?

48:07.812 --> 48:11.470
I killed your werewolf for you,
and I didn't even need silver bullets.

48:11.570 --> 48:13.484
- You're welcome.
- Seriously, Adam?

48:13.784 --> 48:17.388
You scared my deputies half to death
talking about some kind of new breed of wolf!

48:17.488 --> 48:19.222
The entire town is freaking out!

48:19.322 --> 48:23.294
Freaked out because of what I said
or what you said? "Corpse-zombie"?

48:23.394 --> 48:26.430
Isn't that what you called it?
Everybody's talking about that.

48:26.630 --> 48:29.062
I don't know what I saw.

48:31.269 --> 48:36.407
Snout is bigger on this one.
Eyes are larger, the paws bigger.

48:37.007 --> 48:39.597
Here. Feel behind the upper teeth.

48:52.457 --> 48:57.095
Are those two sets of canines?
What the hell is this?

48:57.195 --> 49:01.666
- What are we actually dealing with?
- Genetic mutation?

49:01.816 --> 49:04.518
You think there's something
supernatural about all this?

49:04.868 --> 49:07.370
I mean, something we can't explain?

49:08.170 --> 49:11.045
I don't know about that zombie thing
you saw, but I can tell you this...

49:11.145 --> 49:15.178
nature has a natural process
of adaptation.

49:15.878 --> 49:18.711
I think these animals are evolving...

49:18.811 --> 49:22.466
but supernatural? No.

49:23.920 --> 49:26.319
There's no such thing.

49:49.344 --> 49:51.647
This is where it happened.

49:51.747 --> 49:55.250
My grandma asked me to come down this path,
even though she knew it was dangerous.

49:55.350 --> 49:57.852
I'm still trying to figure out why.

49:57.952 --> 50:01.156
I was ambushed by a wolf,
and that's the last thing I remember.

50:01.256 --> 50:03.998
We're gonna get ambushed by wolves
if we don't keep moving.

50:04.098 --> 50:07.192
It's too dangerous
to be over here at night.

50:11.065 --> 50:13.912
Sammy? What is it?

50:15.804 --> 50:18.090
I died here, Danny.

50:18.190 --> 50:21.877
I don't know how to explain it,
but I died...

50:21.977 --> 50:25.948
and I was buried here and reborn.

50:26.048 --> 50:27.411
Okay.

50:29.351 --> 50:30.818
I can smell the hunger.

50:30.918 --> 50:34.356
That don't sound right.
You're freaking me out now.

50:34.456 --> 50:38.026
- Danny, I can smell your fear!
- No shit!

50:38.126 --> 50:40.817
Have you ever seen a scary movie?
It doesn't work out for me!

50:40.917 --> 50:43.264
I can feel their lust for blood...

50:44.188 --> 50:47.602
their anger, and their fear of...

50:48.102 --> 50:50.772
- the Den Mother.
- The Den Mother?

50:50.872 --> 50:53.958
What the hell are you talking about?
Are you fucking with me right now, Sammy?

50:54.058 --> 50:56.577
Danny! You have to get out of here!

50:56.677 --> 50:58.876
- Sammy, I'm not leaving you, okay?
- Go!

51:00.148 --> 51:04.484
Sammy, I'm not going to leave you!
What's going on? Talk to me!

51:04.584 --> 51:06.750
Get out of here now.

51:28.674 --> 51:32.412
All right, I have a question
for you knuckleheads.

51:32.512 --> 51:34.680
Did your teacher send you
with homework to do?

51:34.780 --> 51:37.450
- Nope. We did it.
- All done, Dad.

51:37.550 --> 51:39.385
All done.

51:39.985 --> 51:44.475
You know, it is my job
to tell when people are lying?

51:48.578 --> 51:50.424
Finish your homework
after dinner, all right?

51:50.524 --> 51:54.600
- Can we play after, Daddy?
- Absolutely. Either of you want more pizza?

51:55.000 --> 51:56.789
Nope.

51:57.137 --> 51:59.368
What's wrong with you?

52:01.007 --> 52:02.862
- What's up, Henry?
- <i>I did a background,</i>

52:02.962 --> 52:06.712
found that Becky Sanders girl
you told me to check.

52:07.112 --> 52:09.960
Guys, I want you to finish
your homework, all right?

52:11.317 --> 52:14.821
Well, she does have a record,
mostly for civil disobedience,

52:14.921 --> 52:18.793
protesting for animal rights, you know,
like the typical bleeding-heart,

52:18.893 --> 52:22.328
- hippie liberal stuff.
- Any outstanding warrants?

52:22.428 --> 52:25.563
Negative on that,
but positive on assault and battery

52:25.663 --> 52:30.154
on three separate occasions
for attacking animal control officers.

52:30.703 --> 52:33.171
Want to know how she attacked them?

52:33.871 --> 52:37.542
- She fucking bit them, Adam!
- She bit them.

52:37.642 --> 52:40.445
<i>Yeah, and you want to know what
makes her even more interesting?</i>

52:40.545 --> 52:43.550
Last year she attacked Esmerelda Winfield.

52:44.365 --> 52:46.034
Wolf Lady.

52:46.134 --> 52:49.033
The woman that supposedly killed herself.

52:50.488 --> 52:52.603
You got a current address?

52:53.153 --> 52:55.810
I got it,
but I'm just verifying right now.

52:56.010 --> 52:59.099
All right, do it. I may have
to pay her a visit in the morning.

52:59.199 --> 53:01.212
- <i>Copy that shit.</i>
- Yeah.

53:03.801 --> 53:05.699
Sammy?

53:07.170 --> 53:08.935
Sammy?

53:13.977 --> 53:15.516
You okay?

53:15.616 --> 53:18.763
Oh, my God, Danny.

53:19.633 --> 53:23.183
- What happened?
- I...

53:24.973 --> 53:27.104
My grandma's house!

53:28.226 --> 53:30.057
Come on!

53:31.296 --> 53:33.027
Shit.

53:39.837 --> 53:41.669
Danny.

53:44.253 --> 53:46.497
Holy fucking shit!

53:48.945 --> 53:51.378
I'm gonna shut this door, babe.

53:53.901 --> 53:56.770
And... I just need to know
what happened out there.

53:57.020 --> 54:01.424
What the hell are you?
Sammy, I need some answers!

54:01.524 --> 54:04.560
My grandmother had a lot of secrets,
and I know that she had a journal.

54:04.660 --> 54:07.044
I just need to find where it is.

54:26.315 --> 54:28.317
Sammy.

54:28.417 --> 54:31.191
That's it. Oh, my gosh, you found it.

54:31.291 --> 54:33.457
Here. Hold this.

54:33.824 --> 54:35.862
Oh, my God.

54:35.962 --> 54:39.759
Look, that's her.
The wolves are afraid of her.

54:42.496 --> 54:46.860
The Den Mother. My grandmother
sacrificed herself for this town.

54:48.504 --> 54:52.258
Which means she sacrificed you too.

54:53.442 --> 54:56.313
She needed to pass on her powers.

54:56.913 --> 54:59.261
If that's the truth,
then that'd mean that you're...

54:59.361 --> 55:00.710
Dead.

55:01.550 --> 55:06.418
That's not possible.
There's no way that you could be dead.

55:07.523 --> 55:10.945
I mean, like, why would she even do that?

55:11.045 --> 55:14.529
The new Den Mother.
A Mega Wolf will rise...

55:14.629 --> 55:18.867
when the hunter's moon
falls on the autumn equinox.

55:18.967 --> 55:22.238
Danny, that's... that's tomorrow night.

55:22.338 --> 55:24.500
Tomorrow night? So what does that mean?

55:24.600 --> 55:26.842
She'll lead her army of wolves...

55:26.942 --> 55:29.554
to kill everyone in sight.

55:53.066 --> 55:54.632
Kendra!

56:15.056 --> 56:16.709
- You all right?
- Where's Henry?

56:16.809 --> 56:19.426
- He said he's on his way.
- I want you guys to wait in my office.

56:19.526 --> 56:21.462
- Daddy...
- Don't worry. Everything's fine.

56:21.562 --> 56:22.614
What happened?

56:22.714 --> 56:27.067
Goddamn wolf came in my house last night.
I shot it twice, and it didn't go down.

56:27.167 --> 56:29.370
- Are you sure you hit it?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

56:29.470 --> 56:32.005
- Hey, hey, where are the kids?
- They're in my office.

56:32.105 --> 56:34.741
- All right, all right. Just relax.
- No, I'm not gonna relax.

56:34.841 --> 56:37.411
Everyone is safe right now.
That's the only thing that matters.

56:37.511 --> 56:41.412
- We're not safe, Henry.
- Sheriff? Sheriff?

56:41.512 --> 56:43.250
I found Sammy.

56:43.350 --> 56:45.852
Well, that's great, Danny.
Can it wait a fucking minute?

56:45.952 --> 56:49.421
Unless you want more deaths
on your hands, then I'll say no.

56:49.521 --> 56:51.787
What are you talking about?

56:53.009 --> 56:54.907
Werewolves.

57:06.183 --> 57:08.742
How much farther is it, Danny?

57:09.242 --> 57:10.973
There.

57:13.066 --> 57:16.382
This is the spot where Victoria said
there wasn't any activity.

57:16.482 --> 57:18.292
That's where we need to go.

57:24.217 --> 57:25.758
Sammy!

57:26.258 --> 57:29.206
- Sammy!
- Danny.

57:30.395 --> 57:32.432
- You good?
- Yeah.

57:33.132 --> 57:34.897
We've been looking for you.

57:36.001 --> 57:39.164
You're the girl?
The girl we saw in the forest?

57:39.264 --> 57:42.025
I've got a lot questions for you.

57:42.675 --> 57:45.177
I'm not exactly sure how to explain it.

57:45.277 --> 57:47.774
I'm still figuring things out.

57:47.874 --> 57:49.364
So now what happens?

57:49.514 --> 57:52.318
We need to find
the new Den Mother tonight.

57:52.418 --> 57:54.903
We need to get to her cave
before it's too late.

57:55.003 --> 57:58.335
We need to catch her asleep,
and it has to be now. Come on.

58:02.760 --> 58:05.406
Tell me again what this
Den Mother looks like.

58:05.670 --> 58:08.866
This is it. Come on.

58:08.966 --> 58:11.715
I guess we're about to find out.

58:33.758 --> 58:36.435
I think she knows we're here already.

58:37.495 --> 58:39.607
Maybe it's too late.

58:39.707 --> 58:43.987
Well, there doesn't seem to be anything
down here. So I'm just going to back...

58:44.087 --> 58:48.935
Actually, according to the book,
we should almost be there.

59:17.101 --> 59:19.099
Shit.

59:26.041 --> 59:29.797
Hey, guys. We've been expecting you.

59:46.979 --> 59:49.813
This was a very, very bad idea.

59:53.102 --> 59:54.738
This isn't good.

59:54.838 --> 59:57.903
Everybody back up real slow.

01:00:01.344 --> 01:00:05.071
- Why aren't they attacking?
- They're waiting for their orders.

01:00:05.171 --> 01:00:08.062
What it this, a fucking drive-through?

01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:38.975
Sammy!

01:00:49.123 --> 01:00:51.507
Everybody get outta here! Sammy, come on!

01:01:00.902 --> 01:01:03.534
They're not going down!

01:01:32.098 --> 01:01:33.424
Sammy!

01:01:35.989 --> 01:01:37.600
Henry!

01:01:43.911 --> 01:01:47.196
- Get off of him!
- Help!

01:01:54.585 --> 01:01:59.597
- We've gotta save Sammy!
- She's gone, Danny! We gotta go now!

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:07.952
Henry! Look, man,
we'll get you out of here, okay?

01:02:08.052 --> 01:02:09.328
Let's go.

01:02:11.538 --> 01:02:13.473
Danny, now!

01:02:13.573 --> 01:02:15.605
Henry!

01:02:17.209 --> 01:02:19.745
He's dead, Danny! Let's go!

01:02:19.845 --> 01:02:21.650
Danny, come on!

01:03:08.092 --> 01:03:10.257
Thanks for being here.

01:03:15.132 --> 01:03:18.100
- Adam, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:21.437
I'm sorry about Henry.

01:03:21.537 --> 01:03:23.978
We'll get his body back, I promise.

01:03:25.911 --> 01:03:29.696
Try to relax. We got this now.

01:03:55.072 --> 01:03:56.674
I'm sorry, Danny.

01:03:56.774 --> 01:04:00.058
I should have turned this over
to the state police from the start,

01:04:00.278 --> 01:04:03.914
and we never should have gone
in there like that alone.

01:04:04.414 --> 01:04:06.651
It wasn't your fault.

01:04:06.751 --> 01:04:09.230
Sammy pushed you to go.

01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:12.110
Tell the state police
what they're dealing with.

01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:15.752
They won't believe anything I tell them.

01:04:17.793 --> 01:04:20.126
You should keep this.

01:04:20.697 --> 01:04:23.829
You'll probably do more justice
with it than me.

01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:28.771
Where are you going?

01:04:29.371 --> 01:04:31.669
Far away from here.

01:04:34.611 --> 01:04:37.214
Hey, Danny, wait.

01:04:37.314 --> 01:04:40.048
Is this supposed to be Sammy?

01:04:40.148 --> 01:04:41.717
Yeah.

01:04:42.617 --> 01:04:45.041
The Keeper's life force.

01:04:45.641 --> 01:04:46.629
What's that?

01:04:46.729 --> 01:04:50.005
The true power lies
in the sword and a cape.

01:04:50.705 --> 01:04:53.630
Sammy never had a sword or a cape,

01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:56.395
which means...

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.187
it's still in the grave. I gotta go.

01:05:00.287 --> 01:05:03.420
- Danny, wait!
- I'm good! I'll be back!

01:05:12.781 --> 01:05:16.696
I saw you with that wolf.
Why didn't it attack you? Hey!

01:05:17.686 --> 01:05:21.453
- Why are you here?
- Let go.

01:05:24.325 --> 01:05:27.596
You are gonna tell me what the fuck
is going on here right now.

01:05:27.696 --> 01:05:30.528
I don't have to fucking tell you anything.

01:05:31.466 --> 01:05:34.331
I know that you attacked Ms. Winfield.

01:05:35.904 --> 01:05:39.288
You really have no idea
what's going on, do you, Sheriff?

01:05:40.308 --> 01:05:43.012
You live in your cozy
little black-and-white world

01:05:43.112 --> 01:05:45.433
with your good guys and your bad guys,

01:05:45.533 --> 01:05:48.516
and you think you got everything
under control.

01:05:49.716 --> 01:05:52.693
What you don't know is that there...

01:05:52.793 --> 01:05:57.524
is a whole world of forces
working all the time all around us,

01:05:57.624 --> 01:06:00.656
and that makes for
a whole hell of lot of gray.

01:06:01.062 --> 01:06:03.497
Who are you?

01:06:03.797 --> 01:06:07.535
News flash, Sheriff.
Your deputy was easy to kill.

01:06:07.635 --> 01:06:09.570
Fuck you!

01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:12.473
Sheriff. What's going on? Relax.

01:06:12.573 --> 01:06:15.891
You're gonna tell me what's going on
around here. Get her out of here.

01:06:15.991 --> 01:06:18.282
- What's going on?
- Get her out of here now! Lock her up!

01:06:18.382 --> 01:06:22.283
You have no idea what you're dealing with.
You're all gonna die tonight, Sheriff.

01:06:27.454 --> 01:06:29.756
- Hey.
- Can we leave now, Daddy?

01:06:29.856 --> 01:06:33.028
- Soon, baby.
- What are you gonna do?

01:06:33.128 --> 01:06:34.992
I gotta find somebody.

01:06:36.396 --> 01:06:40.425
- We're rolling in five minutes.
- Hey. Is Victoria on duty?

01:06:40.525 --> 01:06:42.952
Yeah. I got her up on
the Apex River on the dirt road.

01:06:43.052 --> 01:06:46.986
- You want me to get her on the radio?
- No. No, I need to talk to her in person.

01:06:48.307 --> 01:06:51.110
Can we go with you, Daddy?

01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:54.074
No, sweetheart. Keep an eye on 'em.

01:06:55.014 --> 01:06:58.175
Hey, guys, show me that game.

01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:09.693
Where is it? Shit.

01:07:12.466 --> 01:07:14.197
Shit.

01:07:18.137 --> 01:07:21.403
Come on. Shit.

01:07:24.244 --> 01:07:26.309
Where is it?

01:07:34.785 --> 01:07:36.960
Shit. Yes!

01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.786
Yes!

01:07:48.199 --> 01:07:51.970
I want you to lock yourself in the station
with the kids until I get back.

01:07:52.070 --> 01:07:54.303
You see anything that doesn't look right,

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:57.316
shoot first, then you ask questions later.

01:07:57.510 --> 01:08:01.250
- Do what you gotta do.
- You keep my kids safe.

01:08:24.234 --> 01:08:28.468
Sammy, are you okay? Is it safe?

01:08:43.754 --> 01:08:46.475
All right, Sammy,
this is your life force, okay?

01:08:46.575 --> 01:08:48.720
This is your life force.

01:08:49.727 --> 01:08:52.904
Come on, Sammy. You can do this.

01:08:57.801 --> 01:08:59.670
Sammy!

01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:01.734
Please!

01:09:11.013 --> 01:09:13.484
Hey, I need to talk to you.

01:09:13.584 --> 01:09:16.285
Adam, what are you doing here?

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:19.884
I know this may sound crazy,
but I just need you to consider...

01:09:19.984 --> 01:09:22.792
for one second that werewolves are real...

01:09:23.593 --> 01:09:27.397
and that your wolves
are not some genetic mutation.

01:09:27.647 --> 01:09:31.433
- You've lost your mind.
- Probably.

01:09:32.808 --> 01:09:34.770
But you are the only person
who can help me.

01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:36.256
I'm not so sure about that.

01:09:36.356 --> 01:09:40.776
I have somebody in custody
that you need to meet, all right?

01:09:40.876 --> 01:09:44.142
I can't explain it, I just need you to
come to the station. Will you do that?

01:09:44.242 --> 01:09:46.803
If you don't think there's
anything wrong with her, then I promise

01:09:46.903 --> 01:09:51.054
- I will not bother you again about this.
- Why don't you just let Scudder do his job?

01:09:51.154 --> 01:09:53.921
Why don't you forget
all about what you've seen

01:09:54.022 --> 01:09:56.025
or what you think you've seen,
this person?

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:57.994
Forget the wolves,
and go back to your life

01:09:58.094 --> 01:10:00.596
before somebody
locks you up in a funny farm.

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:03.728
Well, now that's exactly
what I'm worried about.

01:10:04.866 --> 01:10:06.665
Please.

01:10:07.435 --> 01:10:09.505
What's this person's name?

01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:12.708
- Sanders.
- Becky Sanders?

01:10:12.808 --> 01:10:15.444
I know her. She's trouble.

01:10:15.544 --> 01:10:17.797
You got her in custody?

01:10:17.897 --> 01:10:19.624
Yeah.

01:10:19.724 --> 01:10:22.629
I'm telling you,
there's something wrong with her.

01:10:23.218 --> 01:10:25.339
You need to trust me.

01:10:25.621 --> 01:10:27.235
She's worse than you.

01:10:27.335 --> 01:10:30.522
She actually accused people of being
a werewolf and tried to kill 'em.

01:10:40.268 --> 01:10:42.099
Sammy.

01:10:47.542 --> 01:10:49.340
Sammy.

01:10:51.812 --> 01:10:53.472
Do you know that she tried
to attack the Wolf Lady?

01:10:53.572 --> 01:10:56.918
Yes, and she also thinks
that ancient bloodlines

01:10:57.018 --> 01:11:01.056
have been clashing for centuries
over the coveted role of Den Mother,

01:11:01.156 --> 01:11:04.625
the leader of the werewolves and
everything else that goes bump in the night.

01:11:05.525 --> 01:11:07.998
You know the stories.

01:11:08.098 --> 01:11:12.234
Becky thinks she's
a shape-shifter, a werewolf...

01:11:12.834 --> 01:11:15.770
and she wanted to take
the coveted role of Den Mother,

01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:19.141
so she started eliminating her opposition
before the autumn equinox.

01:11:19.241 --> 01:11:20.710
That's why she's been attacking people.

01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:24.292
So she thought that Ms. Winfield
was a werewolf?

01:11:24.979 --> 01:11:26.314
No.

01:11:26.714 --> 01:11:30.063
She thought the Wolf Lady
was Keeper of the Forest.

01:11:34.021 --> 01:11:36.385
I don't understand.

01:11:38.692 --> 01:11:42.127
- You knew about all this?
- They're common tales.

01:11:42.227 --> 01:11:46.483
And like Becky, the Wolf Lady knew
that she was no match for the Den Mother.

01:11:46.933 --> 01:11:50.237
That's why she killed herself and gave
all her powers to her granddaughter.

01:11:50.637 --> 01:11:53.072
She thought a younger bloodline
would be stronger

01:11:53.172 --> 01:11:56.079
and more able to stand up to threats.

01:11:57.144 --> 01:11:58.977
What the hell's going on here?

01:11:59.077 --> 01:12:02.666
I could never figure out
what her bloodline was.

01:12:03.016 --> 01:12:05.286
I didn't know she had a granddaughter.

01:12:05.386 --> 01:12:07.971
I swear I looked for clues everywhere.

01:12:08.921 --> 01:12:12.292
Should have gone into town more,
talked more to the locals.

01:12:12.592 --> 01:12:16.956
- What do you want with Samantha?
- Is that her name?

01:12:17.196 --> 01:12:20.266
Well, she is no longer of any concern.

01:12:20.366 --> 01:12:22.835
She has been taken care of,

01:12:22.935 --> 01:12:26.772
and Becky Sanders has fallen in line
like a good little soldier.

01:12:26.872 --> 01:12:31.242
The full moon has fallen
on the autumn equinox tonight,

01:12:31.342 --> 01:12:35.911
and the Den Mother has taken her
rightful place in the position of power.

01:12:37.217 --> 01:12:39.885
What the hell's going on here?

01:12:41.085 --> 01:12:45.186
You ask too many questions.

01:12:46.324 --> 01:12:49.113
That's what's going on!

01:13:39.244 --> 01:13:42.578
Sheriff! Car's dead!

01:13:42.678 --> 01:13:44.290
This way!

01:14:00.064 --> 01:14:03.066
This a fucking flamethrower?
You know how to use this?

01:14:03.166 --> 01:14:05.130
Let's go!

01:14:16.145 --> 01:14:18.143
Shit.

01:14:19.658 --> 01:14:22.015
Do you know how to work this thing?

01:14:23.437 --> 01:14:26.235
I got it! I got it!

01:14:49.044 --> 01:14:52.982
- Move! Move! It's coming!
- What's going on? We heard the howling.

01:14:53.082 --> 01:14:56.718
- Go! Go! Get the hell out of here!
- Go on! Move! Move!

01:14:56.818 --> 01:14:59.583
- Move!
- Shit!

01:15:00.957 --> 01:15:02.242
Move out!

01:15:09.481 --> 01:15:11.747
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

01:15:13.803 --> 01:15:15.580
Guys, get away!

01:15:28.951 --> 01:15:31.282
Guys, somebody shoot this...

01:17:07.746 --> 01:17:10.148
Gonna burn today!

01:17:11.398 --> 01:17:13.148
Burn!

01:17:38.577 --> 01:17:39.742
Danny!

01:18:22.521 --> 01:18:23.986
Danny.

01:19:08.546 --> 01:19:10.505
Hold your fire!

01:20:22.854 --> 01:20:24.985
Where'd she go?

01:20:47.229 --> 01:20:51.297
I didn't know what to do.
Should we put out an all-point?

01:20:52.001 --> 01:20:54.338
What the hell we gonna tell 'em?

01:20:54.438 --> 01:20:58.485
Prisoner turned into a werewolf
and ate her way through the jail cell?

01:20:59.008 --> 01:21:01.105
She's dangerous.

01:21:01.309 --> 01:21:05.046
Put that camera down,
and get rid of the photos!

01:21:05.446 --> 01:21:07.405
What about the hole?

01:21:07.505 --> 01:21:09.284
Patch it up.

01:21:09.384 --> 01:21:11.453
Secure it.

01:21:12.053 --> 01:21:14.619
Make it like it never happened.

01:21:20.094 --> 01:21:23.397
You headed home?
You gonna stick around for a bit?

01:21:23.497 --> 01:21:25.967
Yeah, I think I'm gonna
stick around for a while.

01:21:26.167 --> 01:21:28.183
Is there any coffee?

01:21:28.283 --> 01:21:30.582
There will be.

01:21:41.615 --> 01:21:43.485
Hi, Sheriff.

01:21:43.585 --> 01:21:46.620
I just wanted to say thank you.

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:48.690
You gonna be all right?

01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:52.432
I have a lot to learn still, but at least
without the threat of the Den Mother,

01:21:52.532 --> 01:21:55.766
I'll have some time to figure things out.

01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:00.834
I am truly sorry about Danny.

01:22:01.234 --> 01:22:03.231
Me, too.

01:22:06.705 --> 01:22:09.693
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Anything.

01:22:09.793 --> 01:22:12.829
You had me down
as a missing person, right?

01:22:13.079 --> 01:22:14.880
That's right.

01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:16.972
Did you ever close that case?

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:23.437
Don't. Leave it.

01:22:27.661 --> 01:22:29.659
Okay.

01:22:29.962 --> 01:22:31.827
Thanks.

01:22:33.533 --> 01:22:35.402
So what are you gonna do now?

01:22:36.975 --> 01:22:39.754
I guess I'm the new Keeper of the Forest.

01:22:39.854 --> 01:22:43.275
But there are other Keepers out there,
so I need to find them.

01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:46.646
You know the Appalachians are a big place.

01:22:47.157 --> 01:22:50.048
- Becky Sanders is out there, too.
- I know.

01:22:50.348 --> 01:22:52.285
You gonna be safe?

01:22:52.585 --> 01:22:54.582
I'll try.

01:23:06.532 --> 01:23:08.763
Who was that?

01:23:10.335 --> 01:23:12.400
Nobody.

01:23:13.872 --> 01:23:16.871
- Abbey.
- Yeah?

01:23:19.044 --> 01:23:22.585
- Thank you.
- For what?

01:23:26.017 --> 01:23:28.248
Just thank you.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.504
If I were a fish, I'd like gummi worms.

01:24:20.604 --> 01:24:22.539
But, Dusty, you're not a fish.

01:24:22.639 --> 01:24:25.476
Daddy, tell Kendra fish like gummi worms.

01:24:25.576 --> 01:24:27.912
I think I like gummi worms...

01:24:28.012 --> 01:24:30.380
- on my pizza.
- Pizza!

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.783
Daddy, can we put
gummi worms on the pizza?

01:24:33.883 --> 01:24:37.094
Yeah, we can put gummi worms on the pizza.

01:24:37.687 --> 01:24:40.834
All right... here we go.
