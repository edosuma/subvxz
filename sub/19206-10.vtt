00:00.138 --> 00:01.638
Previously on Switched at Birth...

00:01.839 --> 00:04.840
So I called a friend of
mine from the Royals days.

00:04.875 --> 00:07.876
He's a scout. And it turns
out they're interested.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.913
The team is in Tokyo.

00:13.517 --> 00:15.116
- You have a girlfriend.
- Maybe I shouldn't.

00:15.152 --> 00:16.452
But you do.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074

00:26.864 --> 00:28.731
Luca and I are together.

00:28.766 --> 00:30.332
Eric only took Will

00:30.368 --> 00:32.299
because he was in a
really dangerous situation.

00:32.336 --> 00:34.002
So Eric is the kidnapper?

00:34.037 --> 00:35.536
The police are still looking for me.

00:35.572 --> 00:37.138
This buys me and Will a new life.

00:37.174 --> 00:39.474
- I want it to include you.
- I can't.

00:39.509 --> 00:41.409
I'll be at the Platte City
Motel out by the airport

00:41.444 --> 00:42.744
if you change your mind.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.850
Regina, anything in the house is yours,

00:48.886 --> 00:52.220
in the pantry and the refrigerator,
and we have a full bar.

00:52.256 --> 00:53.989
I'm sober, Kathryn.

00:54.024 --> 00:56.391
I've been sober for 11 1/2 years.

00:56.426 --> 00:59.261
- I was just saying...
- Look, we agreed to this arrangement

00:59.296 --> 01:01.596
so I could get to know Bay and
you could get to know Daphne.

01:01.631 --> 01:03.798
And, frankly, I could use the free rent.

01:03.833 --> 01:05.666
But I am sure you're about as thrilled

01:05.702 --> 01:07.936
to have me in your
backyard as I am to be here.

01:07.971 --> 01:09.737
So, let's just make one thing clear:

01:09.773 --> 01:12.807
I do not intend to enter
your house without permission,

01:12.842 --> 01:16.744
and I assume you'll extend
me the same courtesy, hmm?

01:20.850 --> 01:23.083
Hey, hon.

01:23.119 --> 01:25.486
You and John love this
stuff, so I made four,

01:25.522 --> 01:28.723
and it came out delicious this
time, if I do say so myself.

01:30.427 --> 01:32.427
What's wrong?

01:34.664 --> 01:37.598
Do you realize it's been five years

01:37.634 --> 01:39.867
since the switch was discovered

01:39.903 --> 01:41.402
and we met?

01:41.438 --> 01:44.472
No. Has it been five years?

01:44.507 --> 01:47.374
Man, you really hated me back then.

01:47.410 --> 01:48.709
I did not.

01:48.745 --> 01:50.611
Yes, you did.

01:50.647 --> 01:54.248
We did have some epic battles.

01:54.283 --> 01:55.983
We sure did.

01:56.018 --> 01:57.951
But look at us now.

02:00.055 --> 02:02.989
Kathryn, I've been thinking.

02:03.024 --> 02:06.827
It's not right that
Toby and Lily and Carlton

02:06.862 --> 02:08.394
are in the house with no privacy

02:08.430 --> 02:10.663
while I'm here in the guest house.

02:10.699 --> 02:14.400
No, we love having Carlton
so close. It's fine.

02:14.436 --> 02:18.438
I know, but...

02:18.474 --> 02:20.440
the girls live on their own now.

02:20.476 --> 02:24.277
You and John have been
so generous for so long

02:24.312 --> 02:26.112
and I don't want anyone to know

02:26.147 --> 02:27.514
until my plans are finalized,

02:27.549 --> 02:30.416
so please don't say anything, but...

02:30.452 --> 02:32.853
I'm gonna move out.

02:33.789 --> 02:35.421
Are you sure?

02:36.558 --> 02:38.391
It's time.

02:44.264 --> 02:49.264

02:52.307 --> 02:54.507
Hi.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.042
Hey, did you know

02:56.077 --> 02:58.611
that there's some big comet
passing by this weekend?

02:58.646 --> 03:01.114
We should get the telescope out.

03:01.149 --> 03:02.882
Be fun to show the kids.

03:02.917 --> 03:04.717
Yeah. Honey, do you know

03:04.752 --> 03:07.387
where the genetic test results are?

03:07.422 --> 03:09.355
When we found out the
girls were switched?

03:09.391 --> 03:10.956
- Yeah.
- Why would you want that?

03:10.992 --> 03:12.758
I don't know.

03:12.793 --> 03:15.094
I guess I'm just feeling nostalgic.

03:15.130 --> 03:18.398
I was thinking of making
Regina a scrapbook.

03:18.433 --> 03:20.399
Do you realize that it's been five years

03:20.434 --> 03:21.734
since she moved in here?

03:21.769 --> 03:23.769
No. Wow.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.470
That stuff has got to be in the garage,

03:25.506 --> 03:27.740
underneath all that car wash paperwork.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.174
- Hey-ho!
- Hey!

03:29.209 --> 03:30.709
Hi!

03:30.745 --> 03:34.212
Guess which up-and-coming tattoo artist

03:34.248 --> 03:36.715
is going to be featured in this month's

03:36.751 --> 03:39.418
Live Ink Magazine ?

03:39.453 --> 03:40.719
Congratulations!

03:40.755 --> 03:42.721
It's the photos that Emmett took

03:42.757 --> 03:45.024
of me giving Ally her tree
tattoo. Isn't that rad?

03:47.194 --> 03:49.795
My art is gonna be in a magazine.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.997
Does that come with
some kind of a paycheck?

03:52.033 --> 03:53.699
- Ha-ha.
- I'm serious.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.200
Well, no.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.136
But they're having this
huge party tomorrow night

03:58.172 --> 04:00.606
to commemorate the 100th
edition of the magazine,

04:00.641 --> 04:03.108
and I swung, like, a plus-eight,

04:03.143 --> 04:04.476
so all of you can come.

04:04.511 --> 04:05.843
Oh, great, a big room

04:05.879 --> 04:07.912
full of bikers and longshoremen.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.848
Dad, tattooing is a
billion-dollar industry.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.185
Okay, all I'm asking
is if some of that money

04:13.220 --> 04:14.852
is gonna find its way into your pocket,

04:14.888 --> 04:16.454
because from what I'm hearing,

04:16.490 --> 04:18.089
there are some bills
that are going unpaid.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.725
Honey, it takes time.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.494
Of course we'll be there.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.597
Thanks, Mom.

04:25.632 --> 04:27.432
Bay, do you still have

04:27.468 --> 04:29.767
the blood test that you
took in biology class?

04:29.803 --> 04:31.669
I'm thinking of making a scrapbook

04:31.705 --> 04:33.305
and I wanted to include it.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.840
I do actually, yeah.
It's in my art studio.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.209
I'll show you.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.214
You given any more thought

04:43.249 --> 04:45.549
to that offer about
you playing in Japan?

04:45.585 --> 04:49.520
Because they need an answer
by the end of the week.

04:54.494 --> 04:56.327
That is fantastic!

04:57.597 --> 04:58.997
Oh, wow!

04:59.032 --> 05:01.165
I am so excited for you!

05:05.939 --> 05:07.505
Why not?

05:18.294 --> 05:19.884
Yeah, all right, all right.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.120
Congratulations, kid.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.623
You just went pro.

05:27.926 --> 05:30.161
I'm going to this guest lecture today,

05:30.196 --> 05:33.364
this rock star orthopedic surgeon

05:33.399 --> 05:35.032
in sports medicine.

05:35.067 --> 05:38.435
He's operated on hundreds
of top the athletes.

05:38.471 --> 05:40.003
- Sounds cool.
- Yeah.

05:40.039 --> 05:41.539
I know Josh is out of town,

05:41.574 --> 05:43.407
so if you need an interpreter,
I'd be happy to help out.

05:43.442 --> 05:45.942
Thanks, but I already set up CART.

05:45.978 --> 05:48.078
It always amazes me,

05:48.113 --> 05:50.881
some speed demon typist
out there listening in

05:50.916 --> 05:52.916
and transcribing what's being said

05:52.951 --> 05:54.851
as if he's sitting right next to you.

05:54.887 --> 05:56.287
It's like magic.

05:56.322 --> 05:57.888
Hola, ladies.

05:57.923 --> 06:00.022
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi, Mingo.

06:00.058 --> 06:01.791
Iris, hey.

06:01.826 --> 06:04.227
I'm actually really glad I ran into you.

06:04.262 --> 06:07.530
I've been meaning to apologize

06:07.566 --> 06:10.166
about the whole Lil Wayne thing.

06:10.202 --> 06:13.670
You know, I didn't
mean to offend you or...

06:13.705 --> 06:15.672
or anyone else, I swear.

06:15.707 --> 06:18.007
I'm really sorry.

06:18.042 --> 06:20.009
Apology accepted.

06:20.044 --> 06:21.143
Thank you.

06:22.214 --> 06:24.180
I am meeting Keeshawn.

06:24.216 --> 06:26.816
- Enjoy your lecture.
- Thanks.

06:27.819 --> 06:31.087
So Iris and Keeshawn, huh?

06:31.122 --> 06:32.622
- Very cool.
- Yeah.

06:32.657 --> 06:35.991
How about you and that pitcher guy?

06:36.027 --> 06:38.595
- Chris.
- How are you guys doing?

06:38.630 --> 06:40.830
- Good, yeah. Good, yeah.
- Good. Yeah.

06:40.865 --> 06:42.031
That's great.

06:42.066 --> 06:43.498
How about you and Amy?

06:43.534 --> 06:46.235
We are also good.

06:46.270 --> 06:48.037
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

06:48.072 --> 06:50.239
Hey, you'll never guess
where I'm going later today.

06:50.274 --> 06:52.842
A Jello-wrestling match.

06:52.877 --> 06:55.878
Is that really how you see me, Red?

06:55.913 --> 06:57.780
A man of such little substance?

06:57.865 --> 07:01.700
Unless you've forgotten,
I do go to this school.

07:01.735 --> 07:04.804
Okay, sorry. What are you doing?

07:04.839 --> 07:07.106
Well, okay, there's this
sports medicine doctor,

07:07.141 --> 07:09.241
- and he's giving a speech today.
- Dr. Bannon?

07:09.277 --> 07:11.277
Yeah, I figured you'd be going.

07:11.312 --> 07:13.412
So you want to be a doctor now?

07:13.447 --> 07:15.214
God, no. No, no.

07:15.249 --> 07:18.650
I want to be an athletic
trainer for a pro sports team.

07:18.686 --> 07:20.186
That suits you.

07:20.221 --> 07:22.621
And who knows, maybe we'll
end up working together

07:22.656 --> 07:24.790
on something someday.
How crazy would that be?

07:24.825 --> 07:26.825
Yeah.

07:28.094 --> 07:30.462
Well, I'll see you there. And, hey,

07:30.497 --> 07:32.931
whoever gets there
first, save seats, okay?

07:32.966 --> 07:34.599
Will do.

07:35.836 --> 07:37.302
Hey. Hey.

07:38.439 --> 07:39.938
Good Lord, are you just getting back?

07:39.973 --> 07:43.107
Yeah, the reception
didn't get over until 3:30.

07:43.143 --> 07:44.609
Hey, buddy.

07:44.645 --> 07:46.545
He slept like a champ last night.

07:46.580 --> 07:48.146
Not a sound out of him.

07:48.181 --> 07:50.915
Oh, so that means he's gonna be awake...

07:50.951 --> 07:52.451
Pretty much all day.

07:52.486 --> 07:54.720
No problem. I'll get some coffee.

07:54.755 --> 07:57.556
Oh, one more thing. I have
prospective student interviews later,

07:57.591 --> 07:59.224
so I'll be home late. Sorry.

07:59.259 --> 08:00.592
No problem.

08:00.627 --> 08:02.125
It's your favorite time of the year.

08:02.161 --> 08:03.927
It is. Do you know,

08:03.963 --> 08:06.296
seeing all that potential
bursting out of the kids,

08:06.332 --> 08:08.198
like, giving them a sense of excitement

08:08.234 --> 08:10.601
about what the future holds,
it's... it's contagious!

08:12.938 --> 08:14.238
You okay?

08:14.273 --> 08:16.807
I don't know. The DJ thing
isn't as fun as it used to be.

08:16.843 --> 08:19.176
Well, you have that
interview tomorrow night.

08:19.211 --> 08:21.178
To be the house DJ at Scratch.

08:21.213 --> 08:22.680
Whoo-hoo.

08:22.715 --> 08:24.181
Well, at least it's steady hours.

08:24.216 --> 08:25.816
You won't have to run around town

08:25.852 --> 08:27.418
trying to scrape together
a decent week's work.

08:27.453 --> 08:31.221
I should be more excited
about it, I know, but...

08:35.193 --> 08:37.094
I just... I want to feel the way you do

08:37.129 --> 08:39.729
when you talk about
interviewing those students.

08:39.765 --> 08:41.765
Well, maybe we should
talk about a career change.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.767
Well, beyond music,

08:43.802 --> 08:45.535
I have exactly zero skills

08:45.570 --> 08:47.637
and a high school education.

08:49.008 --> 08:50.908
Well, don't worry, Eeyore.

08:52.144 --> 08:54.411
We'll find your tail.

08:54.446 --> 08:57.647
Won't we? Yes.

09:00.752 --> 09:02.352
You're moving?

09:02.388 --> 09:04.421
Well, I'm about to open
my second Cracked Mug.

09:04.456 --> 09:07.024
And if I want the new place to succeed,

09:07.059 --> 09:09.393
I feel like I should live close by.

09:09.428 --> 09:11.061
So what have we got?

09:11.096 --> 09:13.195
Well, this is my favorite so far.

09:13.231 --> 09:16.599
The rent is a little
steep, but I can swing it.

09:16.635 --> 09:19.135
I know a way to make the rent cheaper.

09:19.170 --> 09:20.870
How?

09:20.906 --> 09:22.371
We move in together.

09:22.407 --> 09:23.973
Wow.

09:24.008 --> 09:26.275
And you know I'll just be at
your place all the time anyway.

09:26.311 --> 09:28.912
I don't know. This is a big step.

09:28.947 --> 09:30.613
It'll be fun.

09:30.649 --> 09:32.381
I'm neat. I cook.

09:32.417 --> 09:34.651
I'm crazy about you.

09:39.223 --> 09:40.457
Come on. What do you say?

09:42.260 --> 09:43.359
Let's do it.

09:48.700 --> 09:49.966
Mornin'.

09:50.001 --> 09:52.668
Hey.

09:53.871 --> 09:54.937
You all right?

09:54.973 --> 09:56.805
It probably sounds dumb to you

09:56.841 --> 09:58.740
that I care what anyone else thinks,

09:58.776 --> 10:03.779
but my dad kinda dumped on my job today.

10:03.814 --> 10:06.482
Get used to it. You're a tattoo artist.

10:06.517 --> 10:08.750
There's a stigma attached to what we do,

10:08.786 --> 10:10.919
which is partly why we do it.

10:10.955 --> 10:12.921
Tattooing has a long history

10:12.957 --> 10:15.324
of saying "Screw you" to society.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.226
Embrace it.

10:17.261 --> 10:20.662
Yeah, it doesn't help
that I'm barely getting by.

10:20.698 --> 10:24.200
I feel like if I was raking it
in, he'd at least respect that.

10:24.235 --> 10:25.901
Money talks.

10:25.936 --> 10:27.402
I know that you started early too.

10:27.437 --> 10:30.071
How long did it take
you to really get going?

10:30.107 --> 10:32.273
You gotta inch your
way along in this job,

10:32.309 --> 10:34.509
tat by tat, year after year,

10:34.544 --> 10:37.845
unless you land a celebrity.

10:37.881 --> 10:40.615
- Ha!
- Soon as I inked Tove Lo,

10:40.650 --> 10:43.851
I leapt into another stratosphere.

10:43.887 --> 10:46.787
I heard Jordan Deville's gonna
be at the party tomorrow night.

10:46.823 --> 10:48.823
You ink a big fish like her,

10:48.858 --> 10:50.591
your book will be filled in no time.

10:50.627 --> 10:52.793
Got it. Thanks.

10:54.564 --> 10:56.398
I replaced the torn ACL

10:56.433 --> 10:58.033
with a substitute graft made of tendon.

10:58.068 --> 11:01.602
You can use the patellar,
hamstring, quadriceps.

11:01.638 --> 11:04.471
In this case, I used an
autograft from a cadaver.

11:04.507 --> 11:06.941
After six months, Patient Alpha

11:06.976 --> 11:08.676
was completely rehabilitated

11:08.711 --> 11:11.979
and ready to commence
his athletic endeavors,

11:12.015 --> 11:16.316
which may have included
winning the Super Bowl.

11:16.352 --> 11:18.653
At least I have this
ring to show for it.

11:18.688 --> 11:21.856
So now, saving the best for last,

11:21.891 --> 11:24.358
one of you will be lucky enough

11:24.393 --> 11:26.527
to see me in action this summer.

11:26.563 --> 11:29.797
I'm offering a six-week paid internship.

11:31.534 --> 11:34.969
So, got these applications.

11:35.004 --> 11:36.604
Please fill them out.

11:36.639 --> 11:38.705
I'll be conducting interviews tomorrow.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.540
That's class, everyone, and good luck.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.245
Six weeks hanging out with that guy?

11:46.281 --> 11:47.747
How awesome would that be?

11:47.783 --> 11:49.749
I'm totally applying.

11:49.785 --> 11:52.185
I was going to, too.

11:52.220 --> 11:56.189
Oh. Then I guess we'll be
competing against each other.

11:56.224 --> 11:57.924
I guess so.

11:57.960 --> 12:00.694
May the best person win.

12:08.324 --> 12:09.624
No.

12:09.660 --> 12:11.860
I mean, I wanted to, but I didn't.

12:12.796 --> 12:14.796
I think I'm still in love with him.

12:16.633 --> 12:17.933
He asked me to go with him.

12:29.713 --> 12:31.479
I could fly back and forth.

12:31.514 --> 12:33.247
I mean, they're not looking for me.

12:54.670 --> 12:56.837
- Regina.
- Hey, Gabe.

12:56.872 --> 12:58.072
Hey.

12:58.108 --> 13:00.040
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:01.043 --> 13:03.277
Of course Melody couldn't wait

13:03.313 --> 13:05.113
to tell you the big news.

13:05.148 --> 13:06.914
Dean Bledsoe.

13:12.688 --> 13:14.555
Dean of Student Affairs.

13:14.591 --> 13:16.323
That's amazing.

13:16.358 --> 13:18.358
You've always wanted Gallaudet.

13:18.393 --> 13:19.993
Congratulations.

13:24.766 --> 13:26.866
We will figure all that out.

13:26.901 --> 13:29.769
This is too good an
opportunity to pass up.

13:31.039 --> 13:32.105
We're doing this.

13:37.746 --> 13:39.346
What about the boys?

13:45.287 --> 13:48.855
Sounds like we both have
really big talks ahead of us.

13:51.460 --> 13:54.726
I can't forget to mention
basketball and field hockey,

13:54.762 --> 13:57.296
to show I understand
the athletic mindset.

13:57.331 --> 14:00.799
It wouldn't hurt to drop that
your dad played for the Royals.

14:00.834 --> 14:03.669
Good point. I read that
the top three attributes

14:03.704 --> 14:06.272
of an orthopedic surgeon

14:06.307 --> 14:10.142
are good hands, coordination,

14:10.178 --> 14:12.344
and good visual-spatial acumen.

14:12.380 --> 14:15.714
Thanks to my deafness,
I excel at all three.

14:15.749 --> 14:17.916
Damn straight.

14:17.951 --> 14:19.918
It must be amazing to do a job

14:19.953 --> 14:21.820
where you help people every day.

14:21.855 --> 14:24.256
You really want this, don't you?

14:24.292 --> 14:27.025
It's like all these
different parts of me

14:27.061 --> 14:28.794
are coming together.

14:29.863 --> 14:31.730
You're gonna do great.

14:31.765 --> 14:33.464
Thanks for helping me today.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.000
Of course.

14:38.806 --> 14:40.005
How'd it go?

14:40.040 --> 14:41.272
Nailed it.

14:41.308 --> 14:43.341
Congratulations.

14:43.376 --> 14:45.210
Yeah, that guy is so cool.

14:45.245 --> 14:47.679
- You're gonna do great.
- Thanks.

14:47.715 --> 14:49.214
Seriously, good luck.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.392
This is nice.

14:59.927 --> 15:02.060
You being back home, doing photography,

15:02.095 --> 15:04.228
it's like the old days.

15:04.263 --> 15:05.863
Hey,

15:05.899 --> 15:09.600
are you gonna go back
to USC in the fall?

15:22.714 --> 15:24.014
Me too.

15:26.819 --> 15:28.485
It's all because of Travis.

15:28.520 --> 15:32.889
How are things between you and Travis?

15:41.300 --> 15:45.469
I hate that I came
between the two of you.

15:45.504 --> 15:48.005
You know, maybe now that
you're feeling better

15:48.040 --> 15:50.907
and he'll have so much more time

15:50.943 --> 15:52.776
when school ends,

15:52.811 --> 15:54.778
you two can patch things up.

15:54.813 --> 15:57.614
You know, really reconnect.

16:07.225 --> 16:08.692
That's amazing.

16:08.727 --> 16:10.627
I'm gonna text her congratulations!

16:15.200 --> 16:16.833
To Washington, DC?

16:32.577 --> 16:35.343
It's just sad.

16:35.379 --> 16:37.446
You and Melody are leaving.

16:51.328 --> 16:53.062
Yes!

17:16.720 --> 17:19.354
Why do you think we see things
differently all the time?

17:19.388 --> 17:21.556
I don't think that's true, baby.

17:21.592 --> 17:23.657
Mom, we look nothing alike.

17:23.693 --> 17:25.893
Look at our hair. Look at our hands.

17:25.929 --> 17:27.895
Look at our bodies.

17:27.931 --> 17:29.364
Was I adopted or something?

17:29.399 --> 17:32.000
You were not adopted.

17:32.035 --> 17:34.468
If I wanted you to do something,

17:34.504 --> 17:38.339
even if you thought it was crazy...

17:38.374 --> 17:39.940
would you?

17:47.783 --> 17:50.017
What's this?

17:51.787 --> 17:54.955
A second test?

17:54.990 --> 17:58.225
This is a month before we found out.

17:58.261 --> 18:00.194
What?

18:02.632 --> 18:05.799
Wait, why was John
being tested and not me?

18:12.440 --> 18:14.207
He knew.

18:20.816 --> 18:22.649
Hi, Dr. Bannon.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.718
I'm Daphne Vasquez.

18:24.753 --> 18:27.654
Hi. Hold on, who's this?

18:27.690 --> 18:30.423
This is Iris Watkins.
She's my interpreter.

18:30.458 --> 18:33.560
Wait, English isn't your first language?

18:33.595 --> 18:36.095
It's for American Sign Language.

18:36.130 --> 18:37.830
I'm deaf.

18:37.865 --> 18:40.200
But I read lips very well actually.

18:40.235 --> 18:42.935
I like to have an interpreter
for lectures and interviews

18:42.970 --> 18:44.904
just to make sure I don't miss a word.

18:46.474 --> 18:48.774
Well, I'm sorry, but I
think there's been a mistake.

18:48.810 --> 18:52.178
This is an interview for an
orthopedic surgical internship.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.979
I know. That's why I'm here.

18:54.015 --> 18:55.648
But you're deaf.

18:55.684 --> 18:57.149
I assumed that you knew that.

18:57.185 --> 18:58.984
That's what my essay is about...

18:59.020 --> 19:01.020
rising above the extra challenges.

19:01.055 --> 19:02.888
Well, my assistant
should have flagged this.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.557
It's a waste of time.

19:04.593 --> 19:06.593
Why? Has the position
already been filled?

19:06.628 --> 19:09.529
No, but it needs to go to someone
who can actually learn from it.

19:09.564 --> 19:11.663
Doctor, if you read my application,

19:11.699 --> 19:13.498
you'll see that I am
very well qualified.

19:13.534 --> 19:17.136
Look, surgeons wear
masks and you can't hear.

19:17.171 --> 19:18.237
How can you know what's going on

19:18.272 --> 19:21.774
if you can't read my
lips or hear my voice?

19:21.809 --> 19:24.276
There are technological
advances, clear masks.

19:24.311 --> 19:26.612
I'm oral. I wouldn't need ASL.

19:26.647 --> 19:27.947
You know what? This is ridiculous.

19:27.982 --> 19:30.216
You can't be deaf and
be a surgeon, obviously.

19:30.251 --> 19:32.551
I'm aware there would
be extra challenges,

19:32.586 --> 19:34.453
but I am incredibly motivated,

19:34.488 --> 19:36.388
and with a little technological help...

19:36.423 --> 19:39.524
- Are you telling her what I'm saying?
- Yes, sir.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.894
Great, then tell her

19:41.929 --> 19:44.396
she needs to get this dangerous
fantasy out of her head

19:44.431 --> 19:47.633
and focus on something
she's well-suited for.

19:47.668 --> 19:50.001
Try radiology.

19:50.036 --> 19:52.070
It's pretty hard to screw that up.

19:53.607 --> 19:54.906
Thank you.

20:08.187 --> 20:10.653
This is amazing.

20:34.533 --> 20:37.501
I could literally live here.

20:37.536 --> 20:38.902
Congratulations.

20:38.937 --> 20:42.406
I know that you had a crap day.

20:42.441 --> 20:45.708
You can go home. Really,
I promise, it's fine.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.444
No, no, I want to be here

20:47.479 --> 20:49.579
to get my mind off it
and to celebrate you.

21:07.999 --> 21:09.933
Is that...

21:14.305 --> 21:16.473
Jordan Deville.

21:16.508 --> 21:19.208
Once we get settled, I was thinking
we could host the next game night.

21:19.243 --> 21:20.477
Yeah, that sounds like a plan.

21:20.512 --> 21:23.546
Um, we haven't really,
um, found a place yet.

21:24.515 --> 21:25.747
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

21:25.783 --> 21:27.749
I'm just... just really excited.

21:27.785 --> 21:29.017
Want a drink?

21:29.052 --> 21:31.152
Sure.

21:31.188 --> 21:33.288
I'm gonna do a quick lap
so I don't miss anything

21:33.323 --> 21:35.557
before I have to run
out for my interview, so.

21:35.593 --> 21:36.758
- Okay, see you later.
- Okay.

21:36.794 --> 21:38.326
I'll be right behind you.

21:38.362 --> 21:40.762
Hey, honey, you know...

21:40.798 --> 21:42.030
I... I've been thinking,

21:42.065 --> 21:44.299
do you remember how shocked we were

21:44.334 --> 21:46.835
the day we found out that our
daughter had been switched?

21:46.871 --> 21:48.470
Oh, yeah. That was crazy.

21:48.506 --> 21:50.938
Yeah, I mean, you could have
knocked me over with a feather.

21:50.974 --> 21:52.874
- I mean, I was so stunned.
- Yeah.

21:52.909 --> 21:54.308
- Oh, wow. That's cool.
- Yeah.

21:54.343 --> 21:56.878
Hey, there's Bay! Hey!

21:56.913 --> 21:58.713
- Hi.
- Hey.

21:58.748 --> 22:01.415
- Hey.
- Honey, this is so cool.

22:01.450 --> 22:03.350
Thanks, Mom.

22:03.386 --> 22:04.685
- Dad.
- Yeah?

22:04.721 --> 22:06.353
Isn't the art here amazing?

22:06.389 --> 22:09.524
Some of the pieces
can take months to do.

22:09.559 --> 22:10.825
Yeah.

22:12.128 --> 22:14.962
Hey, how was your interview today?

22:15.932 --> 22:18.365
- Great.
- Oh, that's fantastic.

22:18.401 --> 22:21.435
You know, it is gonna be one
of the proudest days of my life

22:21.470 --> 22:25.672
when you finally get
that MD after your name.

23:59.900 --> 24:01.366
Well, it's official.

24:01.401 --> 24:03.002
Dad thinks I'm a failure.

24:03.037 --> 24:05.570
- He does not.
- That's easy for you to say.

24:05.606 --> 24:07.339
You're his pride and joy.

24:07.374 --> 24:10.975
To be fair, you know, you
came here 15 years late.

24:11.011 --> 24:14.212
Now, you and I had all those
extra years to disappoint him.

24:14.248 --> 24:16.615
And I'm pretty sure I
undid all that good will

24:16.650 --> 24:18.383
when I blackmailed a senator.

24:18.418 --> 24:20.118
Oh, yeah, that was pretty bad.

24:20.154 --> 24:22.320
It definitely beats the time

24:22.356 --> 24:24.322
that Wilke and I broke into Buckner

24:24.358 --> 24:26.057
to steal the final exam.

24:26.092 --> 24:27.392
Good ol' Wilke.

24:27.427 --> 24:29.394
Oh, well, of course there was the time

24:29.429 --> 24:31.563
that you tagged the car wash.

24:31.598 --> 24:33.865
Oh, yes, and when you ran away

24:33.900 --> 24:36.034
to Mexico with that crazy girl!

24:36.069 --> 24:37.602
Zarra. And yeah,

24:37.638 --> 24:39.637
- she was a little crazy.
- Yeah.

24:39.673 --> 24:41.973
We sure have given J and K

24:42.008 --> 24:44.976
a lot of hard times
over the last few years.

24:45.011 --> 24:46.477
- Yeah.
- You did.

24:46.512 --> 24:48.479
Uh, you did too. We all did.

24:48.514 --> 24:50.614
All of us. All of us.

24:52.618 --> 24:54.318
I gotta get to this interview.

24:54.353 --> 24:56.353
All right, love you guys.

24:56.389 --> 24:58.455
- Bye.
- Good luck.

25:01.995 --> 25:04.062
Is it okay if I ditch you for a second?

25:04.097 --> 25:07.298
- Where are you going?
- To catch a big fish.

25:10.804 --> 25:12.303
Hi.

25:12.338 --> 25:14.137
I should be on the list.

25:14.173 --> 25:16.506
Bay Kennish.

25:16.541 --> 25:18.274
Great.

25:19.511 --> 25:20.610
Thank you.

25:20.645 --> 25:22.913
I'm a VIP!

25:22.948 --> 25:24.414
Um, hi.

25:24.449 --> 25:27.283
First of all, I just wanted
to say, you are amazing.

25:27.319 --> 25:28.785
Second off all, my name is Bay.

25:28.821 --> 25:30.887
I'm a tattoo artist and
I think you and I could

25:30.923 --> 25:33.289
create something awesome together.

25:33.325 --> 25:35.358
Don't try to sell me right
now. I'm just chillin'.

25:35.393 --> 25:39.596
Okay, but, um, let me just
give you my card. Uh...

25:39.631 --> 25:40.964
What's up?

25:40.999 --> 25:42.498
I'm Noelle.

25:42.534 --> 25:44.467
Hi. Jordan.

25:44.502 --> 25:45.969
Holy crap, those are gorgeous.

25:46.004 --> 25:47.470
- Did you do those?
- Yeah.

25:47.505 --> 25:50.573
I own a place called
Bombshell Betty on Linwood.

25:50.609 --> 25:52.775
This one's kind of annoying,

25:52.810 --> 25:55.044
but she's actually crazy talented.

25:55.079 --> 25:57.780
In about year, you won't be able
to get an appointment with her.

25:57.815 --> 25:59.115
Total star.

25:59.150 --> 26:00.650
Yeah?

26:00.685 --> 26:02.619
She could give you
something pretty sweet,

26:02.654 --> 26:04.887
like right here.

26:04.922 --> 26:08.924
I'll be sure to stop by
next time I'm in the city.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.293
Cool.

26:11.763 --> 26:13.563
Oh, my god.

26:13.598 --> 26:15.865
Thank you.

26:15.900 --> 26:17.700
Did you really mean what you said?

26:17.736 --> 26:19.602
You think I'm good?

26:19.638 --> 26:21.169
Yeah, dude.

26:21.204 --> 26:23.338
A guy across town tried to steal you,

26:23.374 --> 26:25.607
- and I told him to stay the hell away.
- You did?

26:25.643 --> 26:27.609
Now don't go getting any ideas

26:27.645 --> 26:30.812
about raises or whatever.
You're still learning.

26:30.847 --> 26:34.015
But you got it.

26:34.110 --> 26:35.610
Thank you.

26:44.888 --> 26:46.421
There you are.

26:46.457 --> 26:48.189
Thanks.

26:49.292 --> 26:51.526
Your daughter is so freaking talented.

26:51.562 --> 26:53.528
- Yeah.
- Then, of course,

26:53.564 --> 26:55.496
she is your kid.

26:58.501 --> 27:03.671
Um, I'm not sure that us moving
in together is the best idea.

27:03.706 --> 27:05.506
What?

27:05.541 --> 27:07.341
Why not?

27:07.377 --> 27:09.076
Luca...

27:09.111 --> 27:11.078
Don't do this.

27:11.113 --> 27:12.110
You're always second-guessing

27:12.111 --> 27:13.640
our relationship
because of the age thing.

27:13.750 --> 27:15.483
How many ways do I have to show you

27:15.518 --> 27:17.685
it doesn't matter to me?

27:17.720 --> 27:19.186
I love you.

27:19.221 --> 27:20.788
And you love me.

27:21.957 --> 27:23.791
Right?

27:23.826 --> 27:26.927
Regina, say something.

27:26.962 --> 27:28.863
I'm so sorry.

27:30.767 --> 27:32.732
I'm in love with someone else.

27:32.768 --> 27:35.902
Wait, who?

27:35.937 --> 27:37.737
Someone from the past.

27:37.773 --> 27:39.739
I saw him when you were in Cabo

27:39.775 --> 27:42.809
and it made me realize that...

27:42.844 --> 27:45.311
I'm not over him.

27:46.915 --> 27:49.416
You are such a great guy.

27:49.451 --> 27:50.517
Stop.

28:04.011 --> 28:06.878
Toby, Zav Tarkanian.

28:06.913 --> 28:08.379
Nice to meet you.

28:08.414 --> 28:10.048
How did you know it was me?

28:10.083 --> 28:12.383
I saw you in London last year
at one of your club nights.

28:12.418 --> 28:14.285
Wow, Tanzi-bar?

28:14.320 --> 28:16.453
Yeah. You were totally killing it.

28:16.489 --> 28:19.157
I couldn't believe my luck
when I found out you were in KC.

28:19.192 --> 28:21.325
Sorry, I'm just... I'm a fan.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.427
- Shall we sit?
- Sure.

28:34.073 --> 28:36.606
So what's it like to be
so massively talented?

28:51.724 --> 28:54.324
I'm so glad you found it.

28:58.230 --> 29:01.298
Daphne, this is Toby!

29:01.333 --> 29:03.900
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

29:03.936 --> 29:05.468
You two sure look alike!

29:05.503 --> 29:08.104
No matter how loud you yell,
she still can't hear you.

29:08.140 --> 29:09.639
Right, of course.

29:16.815 --> 29:18.481
Hey.

29:18.516 --> 29:20.317
Oh!

29:20.352 --> 29:22.152
Bay is so talented.

29:22.187 --> 29:23.753
She really is.

29:23.788 --> 29:26.389
Well, I guess that would have popped

29:26.425 --> 29:27.924
no matter who raised her.

29:27.960 --> 29:30.460
It's funny, huh?

29:30.495 --> 29:32.228
What comes from John and I

29:32.264 --> 29:34.029
and what comes from Regina?

29:35.833 --> 29:37.732
I guess you both are

29:37.768 --> 29:40.569
really great combos of all of us, huh?

29:40.604 --> 29:42.838
Can I ask you a question?

29:42.873 --> 29:44.373
Yeah.

29:44.408 --> 29:46.575
When you first met me, you were nervous

29:46.610 --> 29:48.110
because I'm deaf, right?

29:48.145 --> 29:49.644
Yeah.

29:49.680 --> 29:51.947
I don't think I'd
ever had a conversation

29:51.983 --> 29:53.515
with a deaf person before

29:53.550 --> 29:55.650
and I didn't know sign language

29:55.686 --> 29:58.787
and I'd been trained to see the world

29:58.822 --> 30:00.956
as hearing, good,

30:00.992 --> 30:03.158
deaf, sad.

30:03.194 --> 30:06.328
But you, you changed that.

30:06.364 --> 30:08.697
Why are you asking?

30:08.732 --> 30:11.666
I don't know. I just...

30:12.636 --> 30:14.836
Maybe I should find a career

30:14.872 --> 30:16.938
that doesn't fight my disability.

30:16.974 --> 30:20.141
I know that I could become a doctor

30:20.176 --> 30:22.210
if I continue to fight people,

30:22.245 --> 30:23.979
but let's be honest,

30:24.014 --> 30:27.215
it would require so many modifications

30:27.250 --> 30:29.618
and special arrangements.

30:29.653 --> 30:31.887
Am I swimming upstream?

30:31.922 --> 30:34.455
Do you want to be a doctor?

30:35.626 --> 30:37.959
I really do.

30:37.995 --> 30:39.961
Well, then it's true,

30:39.997 --> 30:41.963
you will have to figure out

30:41.999 --> 30:44.565
brand new ways to do things.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.967
But I think

30:47.003 --> 30:50.103
the fact that you will
have to be so resourceful

30:50.139 --> 30:51.839
will make you

30:51.874 --> 30:55.876
a truly great doctor.

30:55.912 --> 30:57.878
I might need

30:57.914 --> 31:00.213
a lot of pep talks along the way.

31:00.249 --> 31:01.982
You got it.

31:13.729 --> 31:16.229
My uncle bought Scratch
for the location,

31:16.265 --> 31:18.698
but we're gutting it and
turning it into a dance club.

31:18.733 --> 31:20.366
We want you to do two nights a week.

31:20.401 --> 31:22.435
Oh, I thought it was more
of like a full-time gig.

31:22.470 --> 31:23.636
Oh, it is.

31:23.672 --> 31:25.104
You'd spin two nights a week

31:25.139 --> 31:27.173
and be in charge of
booking the other nights.

31:27.208 --> 31:29.742
You could bring in whoever
you want, full autonomy.

31:29.778 --> 31:32.712
Wow, that's... that's good.

31:32.747 --> 31:35.448
Excuse me, sir, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

31:35.483 --> 31:37.684
You have to go now.

31:37.719 --> 31:39.552
Hello? Can you hear me?

31:39.588 --> 31:40.853
Do you speak English?

31:40.889 --> 31:42.555
You need to go now!

31:42.591 --> 31:44.290
- Hey, you...
- Pack up and get out.

31:44.325 --> 31:46.626
- Hold on just one sec.
- Look, I'm gonna call the cops if you don't go.

31:46.661 --> 31:48.294
- Give it back!
- Please stop yelling.

31:48.329 --> 31:50.563
- Sir, can I help out here for a second?
- He hasn't bought anything.

31:50.599 --> 31:52.865
He's upsetting people. He can't be here.

31:52.901 --> 31:54.366
- Look, look...
- I'm watching this.

31:54.402 --> 31:56.502
- Listen, you need to leave now.
- Give it back now!

31:56.537 --> 31:58.370
- Pack up and go.
- Give it back now!

31:58.406 --> 32:00.239
Tell you what, get him
a juice. Put it on me.

32:00.274 --> 32:02.106
You just have to be
patient with him, all right?

32:02.107 --> 32:03.167
He's not like everybody else.

32:03.174 --> 32:04.676
- I want him out of here.
- It's okay.

32:04.712 --> 32:06.245
I'm trying to help you out, but just...

32:06.280 --> 32:07.846
you don't need to call the cops, okay?

32:07.881 --> 32:09.515
- Just be patient.
- Give it back!

32:09.550 --> 32:11.617
It's okay, man, it's
okay. Let's just sit down.

32:11.652 --> 32:13.552
- Let's just sit down, okay?
- You've got two minutes.

32:13.588 --> 32:14.720
All right.

32:14.755 --> 32:16.455
How is it going? I'm Toby.

32:16.491 --> 32:18.457
- I'm Harrison.
- Harrison?

32:18.493 --> 32:20.459
- Yeah, Harrison.
- Nice to meet you, man.

32:20.495 --> 32:22.794
- Hey.
- You a Megadeth fan?

32:22.830 --> 32:25.831
- The band is awesome.
- Yeah. Yeah, it is. It's great.

32:25.866 --> 32:27.833
Listen, Harrison,

32:27.868 --> 32:30.936
is there anyone I could call for you?

32:30.971 --> 32:32.771
Nina.

32:32.806 --> 32:35.173
- Nina?
- Nina takes care of me.

32:35.208 --> 32:36.908
- Nina takes care of you?
- Yeah.

32:36.944 --> 32:40.012
It's Nina, Nina, Nina.

32:40.047 --> 32:41.513
Okay, great.

32:41.548 --> 32:43.949
Well, look, I'm gonna give Nina a call,

32:43.984 --> 32:46.518
and then we can just...
we can just hang out.

32:46.553 --> 32:48.520
- Yeah.
- Cool.

32:48.555 --> 32:50.989
I just landed my first big client.

32:51.025 --> 32:53.025
Jordan Deville is gonna stop by my shop

32:53.060 --> 32:55.193
the next time she's in KC, maybe.

32:56.830 --> 32:58.797
Honey, is this really
your long-term plan?

32:58.832 --> 33:01.767
It's my medium-term plan. Why?

33:01.802 --> 33:03.601
Because it's not a career.

33:03.637 --> 33:05.102
Yes, it is, Dad.

33:05.138 --> 33:07.437
I'm not some kid tagging
alleys anymore, okay?

33:07.473 --> 33:08.939
I've made a profession out of my art.

33:08.975 --> 33:11.075
You said you were going
to go to art school,

33:11.110 --> 33:14.145
which would lead to some
kind of a professional path.

33:14.180 --> 33:15.880
Well, that didn't work out, did it?

33:15.915 --> 33:17.748
So, I found my own path.

33:17.784 --> 33:20.484
How is it that you
still don't respect that?

33:20.519 --> 33:22.153
'Cause this is a dead end.

33:22.188 --> 33:24.388
You have always wanted
me to be more like you.

33:24.423 --> 33:26.924
- I'm not your blood.
- This has nothing to do with that, Bay.

33:26.959 --> 33:28.926
Oh, you act like it doesn't
matter, but deep down,

33:28.961 --> 33:31.228
you cannot stand that
I'm not more like you.

33:31.263 --> 33:32.346
I have supported you a lot...

33:32.347 --> 33:34.564
Not the way you support
Daphne and her career!

33:34.566 --> 33:36.266
- Are we gonna bring that up again?
- Yes, we are, because it's true.

33:36.302 --> 33:38.468
And you know what? I wasn't
even gonna say anything,

33:38.504 --> 33:40.870
but I cannot believe that you
kicked my boyfriend off the team

33:40.906 --> 33:41.861
for standing up to somebody

33:41.862 --> 33:44.051
who was making fun of
people with disabilities.

33:44.075 --> 33:46.710
What are you talking about?
I fought like hell for Travis.

33:46.745 --> 33:48.745
Oh, yeah, it sure looks like it.

33:48.850 --> 33:51.785
Your mom and I both fought
like hell for him, okay?

33:51.820 --> 33:54.154
How do you think he's off to Japan

33:54.189 --> 33:56.623
if I didn't pull, like,
10 different strings?

33:57.726 --> 33:58.958
What?

34:00.562 --> 34:02.729
Look, never mind.

34:02.765 --> 34:04.798
That is not the point. The point is...

34:04.833 --> 34:07.801
What do you mean he's off to Japan?

34:11.973 --> 34:14.639
I think you should go
talk to your boyfriend.

34:17.820 --> 34:19.920
So you're leaving?

34:27.661 --> 34:28.995
Away from me.

34:47.982 --> 34:49.449
Yeah, maybe I could get

34:49.484 --> 34:51.618
a chair out there, like in Beijing.

34:54.155 --> 34:58.290
So what would I do?

35:03.397 --> 35:04.764
Right. Right.

35:13.307 --> 35:14.840
That's true.

35:27.491 --> 35:29.155
I know.

35:33.527 --> 35:35.360
Of course.

35:42.636 --> 35:45.470
- That's my son Carlton right there.
- Oh, he's, like, cute.

35:45.506 --> 35:47.071
Thanks. And that's my wife Lily.

35:47.107 --> 35:49.240
- Ooh!
- Thanks.

35:49.276 --> 35:51.843
I'm sure your caretaker is
gonna be here pretty soon.

35:51.878 --> 35:54.179
- Yeah.
- Harrison.

35:54.214 --> 35:56.448
- Nina.
- Oh, hey.

35:56.483 --> 35:58.016
You're Nina?

35:58.051 --> 35:59.584
Yeah. Why?

35:59.620 --> 36:02.521
Uh, nothing. Wow.

36:02.556 --> 36:05.089
- Hi, I'm Toby.
- Nice to meet you.

36:05.125 --> 36:07.492
What happened, Harrison?
Where did you go?

36:07.528 --> 36:10.761
You said you were going to
meet me at the restaurant.

36:10.797 --> 36:13.631
Okay, but you have to wait for me.

36:13.666 --> 36:16.967
Wait, so you're his caretaker?

36:17.002 --> 36:19.203
I'm his roommate. I look after him.

36:19.238 --> 36:21.706
He's usually great with directions.

36:21.741 --> 36:23.708
Thanks for helping him.

36:23.743 --> 36:25.142
No problem.

36:25.177 --> 36:28.078
Come on, I'll take you home.

36:29.114 --> 36:30.247
Goodbye, Toby.

36:30.282 --> 36:32.450
- See you, Harrison.
- Bye.

36:42.927 --> 36:44.828
Hey.

36:46.598 --> 36:48.665
Are you okay?

36:51.403 --> 36:53.436
What happened?

36:54.939 --> 36:56.939
I broke up with Luca.

36:57.909 --> 36:59.876
Oh, no.

36:59.911 --> 37:02.178
Yeah.

37:02.213 --> 37:05.114
Hey, what do you say we get out of here?

37:05.149 --> 37:07.250
Do you want to go for a drive?

37:08.219 --> 37:10.086
Yeah.

37:14.158 --> 37:16.492
Hey, here you go.

37:16.527 --> 37:19.327
No thank you. I have to go
to the ladies' room anyway.

37:19.363 --> 37:21.697
Hey, Kathryn, wait a
second. Wait, wait, wait.

37:21.732 --> 37:24.199
If I didn't know any better, I'd
think you were trying to avoid me.

37:24.234 --> 37:25.501
Maybe I am.

37:26.970 --> 37:28.003
Why?

37:28.038 --> 37:29.671
Because it's my daughter's party

37:29.707 --> 37:31.172
and I don't want to ruin it.

37:31.208 --> 37:33.041
Ruin it? How?

37:33.076 --> 37:35.944
I found the other test, John.

37:35.979 --> 37:38.013
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:38.048 --> 37:41.784
The DNA test you took five
years ago without telling me.

37:43.487 --> 37:45.554
Okay.

37:46.924 --> 37:48.724
I can explain that.

37:48.759 --> 37:51.726
And kept it from me for all these years.

37:51.761 --> 37:54.162
Kathryn, Kathryn, stop. Kathryn.

37:55.465 --> 37:59.100
When Bay took that
blood test, it threw me.

37:59.136 --> 38:01.202
She should have matched
one of us and she didn't.

38:01.238 --> 38:02.870
It didn't make any sense.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.505
I mean, it was driving me crazy.

38:04.541 --> 38:06.607
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.

38:06.643 --> 38:10.478
So, I took some hair from her brush

38:10.513 --> 38:13.915
and I had Bay and myself tested.

38:13.951 --> 38:18.353
You let us sit in that
office and be ambushed.

38:18.388 --> 38:20.088
We've done extensive

38:20.123 --> 38:22.690
12-marker testing on all three of you.

38:22.725 --> 38:26.760
It is 99.9% certain

38:26.795 --> 38:29.663
that Bay is not related to you.

38:30.933 --> 38:33.567
The hospital believes
there was a mix-up.

38:35.137 --> 38:37.537
Bay and I had the rug
pulled out from under us,

38:37.573 --> 38:39.573
and you just sat there
with a blank stare.

38:39.608 --> 38:41.475
I didn't know she was switched.

38:41.510 --> 38:43.477
That was a complete surprise to me.

38:43.512 --> 38:45.245
I mean, how could I know that?

38:45.281 --> 38:47.814
What did you think?

38:47.850 --> 38:49.916
That I cheated on you?

39:03.918 --> 39:06.619
How can anyone else live there?

39:06.654 --> 39:08.020
That's our house.

39:09.257 --> 39:10.857
I know.

39:12.861 --> 39:15.428
You went through a lot here, didn't you?

39:15.463 --> 39:17.864
I got sick and went deaf.

39:17.899 --> 39:19.899
Angelo left.

39:19.934 --> 39:22.201
You had to raise me by yourself

39:22.236 --> 39:24.970
for a long time.

39:25.006 --> 39:27.540
That's true.

39:27.575 --> 39:31.644
But I also got sober here,

39:31.679 --> 39:35.080
grew my business, made up with Grandma.

39:35.116 --> 39:36.749
I made it.

39:36.785 --> 39:38.418
I made it through it all.

39:39.954 --> 39:41.921
Whatever we're given,

39:41.956 --> 39:45.090
if we want it bad enough, we get it.

39:45.126 --> 39:47.192
Vasquez women are tough.

39:47.228 --> 39:49.328
We don't quit.

39:49.363 --> 39:51.230
And we don't take crap from anyone.

39:55.502 --> 39:57.469
Move to Mission Hills?

39:57.504 --> 39:59.838
It's a great offer. Why not?

39:59.873 --> 40:02.975
Because this is our neighborhood.

40:03.010 --> 40:05.377
I grew up here, Daphne grew up here,

40:05.413 --> 40:06.979
and I'm not going anywhere.

40:07.014 --> 40:10.115
You're doing the right
thing for your daughter.

40:10.151 --> 40:12.117
She's happy here.

40:12.153 --> 40:15.854
I meant both your daughters.

40:15.889 --> 40:18.389
Bay is almost 16 years old.

40:18.425 --> 40:20.859
I'm a complete stranger to her.

40:20.894 --> 40:23.495
What if she hates me?

40:23.530 --> 40:26.331
I think it's just easier to take it slow

40:26.366 --> 40:28.199
and not force this whole thing.

40:29.903 --> 40:32.337
Will it be hard?

40:32.372 --> 40:34.773
Yes, it will.

40:38.345 --> 40:42.246
But sometimes you have
to do the hard thing

40:42.282 --> 40:44.950
to get to the place
where you need to be.

40:50.923 --> 40:53.891
I miss this neighborhood.

40:53.926 --> 40:57.095
It was a really good place to grow up.

41:01.308 --> 41:03.241
Wow, Japan.

41:03.276 --> 41:04.508
That's a really big decision.

41:04.544 --> 41:08.612
I'm finally building
something for myself here,

41:08.648 --> 41:10.781
but am I crazy to turn down

41:10.817 --> 41:13.151
an opportunity to live in Japan?

41:13.186 --> 41:15.519
And what's gonna happen to me and Travis

41:15.555 --> 41:17.788
if I don't go? When Emmett moved away...

41:17.824 --> 41:20.358
You and Travis are not you and Emmett.

41:20.393 --> 41:22.360
Every relationship is different.

41:23.296 --> 41:25.330
Plus, I worry about him.

41:25.365 --> 41:26.696
I mean, it's not a deaf thing.

41:26.731 --> 41:28.798
I know that he is perfectly
capable without me.

41:28.834 --> 41:31.368
It's nice to have someone
to look out for you.

41:34.273 --> 41:36.239
Honey, you know the answer.

41:36.275 --> 41:38.408
What do you want to do?

42:15.880 --> 42:18.214
You didn't leave.

42:18.249 --> 42:19.914
No.

42:19.949 --> 42:21.416
I didn't.

42:21.451 --> 42:24.219
You thought I had cheated on you.

42:24.254 --> 42:27.655
You thought Bay was
someone else's daughter.

42:29.859 --> 42:31.426
But you didn't leave us.

42:31.461 --> 42:33.895
You're my family.

42:35.532 --> 42:37.565
I would never leave either of you.

42:37.600 --> 42:39.934
That's why I never said anything.

42:39.969 --> 42:43.004
Bay may not have been my child...

42:46.709 --> 42:49.544
but she's my child.

42:51.181 --> 42:53.180
I should have known.

42:58.521 --> 43:00.220
I love you.

43:00.256 --> 43:01.788
I love you.

43:10.732 --> 43:13.733
I know you think it's
your job to protect her,

43:13.769 --> 43:15.469
to protect all of us,

43:15.504 --> 43:17.904
but she has to make her own decisions,

43:17.940 --> 43:21.041
even if they're inexplicable to you.

43:45.133 --> 43:48.534
If I asked you to do something crazy,

43:48.570 --> 43:50.669
would you consider it?

44:48.091 --> 44:49.958
She has a job, she takes the bus,

44:49.993 --> 44:52.360
- she's totally independent!
- That's great.

44:52.395 --> 44:54.628
I mean, I've read all
that stuff was possible,

44:54.664 --> 44:56.864
but seeing it, you know,

44:56.899 --> 44:59.032
knowing that Carlton could
actually be that someday...

44:59.068 --> 45:01.569
Yeah, well, we're doing everything
we can to make that possible.

45:01.604 --> 45:04.271
I know, and whoever he turns out to be

45:04.306 --> 45:06.006
is okay with me.

45:06.041 --> 45:07.842
It's just the thing is,

45:07.877 --> 45:09.810
when he's an adult and on his own,

45:09.846 --> 45:11.912
I just want people to
know how to treat him.

45:11.948 --> 45:13.747
You can't just yell.

45:13.783 --> 45:15.583
You have to be patient, slow down.

45:15.618 --> 45:17.985
Not everyone's the same,
and that's not a bad thing.

45:18.020 --> 45:19.353
You're right.

45:24.794 --> 45:26.594
I think this is what I want to do.

45:26.629 --> 45:28.729
What?

45:28.764 --> 45:30.397
Educate people.

45:30.432 --> 45:33.833
Advocate for kids like Carlton.

45:33.869 --> 45:35.535
I don't know how exactly...

45:35.570 --> 45:39.106
as a lawyer or writer or teacher.

45:39.201 --> 45:42.135
Well, you don't need to
figure that out right now.

45:42.171 --> 45:44.137
Yeah, I guess not.

45:44.173 --> 45:46.773
If only you knew someone
in the Disabilities Program

45:46.808 --> 45:49.242
who could hook you up with classes...

45:59.888 --> 46:02.789
You and Emmett are the
same as me and Daphne.

46:02.824 --> 46:04.657
Family, but not by blood.

46:04.693 --> 46:06.426
You miss him.

46:08.296 --> 46:10.797
He wants to come with you.

46:12.899 --> 46:15.134
He's ready to do something like that.

46:15.169 --> 46:18.437
I mean, he's dying to
do something like that.

46:18.473 --> 46:20.907
And...

46:20.942 --> 46:23.009
he misses you too.

46:26.214 --> 46:28.247
Um...

46:33.622 --> 46:35.421
Travis, I need to stay.

46:43.897 --> 46:47.032
It means that...

46:47.067 --> 46:49.868
we are strong enough

46:49.903 --> 46:51.403
to let each other do

46:51.439 --> 46:53.705
what's best for ourselves.

46:55.169 --> 46:58.136
It means that I'm spending
Thanksgiving in Tokyo.

46:58.172 --> 47:01.707
It means that every
time I look at my phone,

47:01.742 --> 47:04.577
I'm gonna be adding 14 hours to it,

47:04.612 --> 47:07.613
wondering when I can call you again.

47:10.284 --> 47:14.587
I am not going anywhere, Travis.

47:18.025 --> 47:19.558
We're real.

47:34.541 --> 47:37.943
- What are you doing here?
- "No employer shall discriminate against"

47:37.978 --> 47:40.178
"any qualified individual
on the basis of disability"

47:40.213 --> 47:42.013
- Okay, that's enough.
- "in regards to the hiring,"

47:42.049 --> 47:43.748
"advancement or discharge of employees,"

47:43.783 --> 47:46.184
- Tell her she needs to leave now.
- "employee compensation,"

47:46.219 --> 47:49.821
"job training, or any other
privilege of employment."

47:49.856 --> 47:52.122
That's from the Americans
with Disabilities Act,

47:52.158 --> 47:54.191
which you flagrantly violated yesterday.

47:54.226 --> 47:55.692
No, I said you weren't qualified.

47:55.727 --> 47:57.428
You are taking my words out of context.

47:57.463 --> 47:59.296
Iris, you have excellent hearing.

47:59.332 --> 48:00.931
What did he say?

48:00.967 --> 48:04.368
I'm pretty sure his exact
words were, "This is ridiculous.

48:04.403 --> 48:07.438
You cannot be deaf and
be a surgeon, obviously."

48:07.473 --> 48:09.639
If I have the smarts and the motivation,

48:09.675 --> 48:12.977
it is up to you and the
hospital to provide the means.

48:13.012 --> 48:14.478
That's the law.

48:14.513 --> 48:16.413
So is that why you're
here? You're gonna sue me?

48:16.449 --> 48:17.982
No, that's not my style.

48:18.017 --> 48:20.517
I'm here to deliver a message.

48:20.552 --> 48:23.987
I may not be the most qualified
person for this internship.

48:24.022 --> 48:25.989
Maybe my grades aren't good enough.

48:26.024 --> 48:27.790
Maybe my essay sucked.

48:27.825 --> 48:30.226
But I'll be damned if I let my deafness

48:30.261 --> 48:32.428
stand in the way of me becoming a doctor

48:32.464 --> 48:35.231
or surgeon or whatever I want to be.

48:35.266 --> 48:37.333
I won't give up, not ever.

48:37.369 --> 48:39.902
So, stay the hell out of my way.

48:59.256 --> 49:00.823
- Will.
- Regina!

49:03.260 --> 49:04.960
I've missed you.

49:04.996 --> 49:07.696
Look at you. You're so big.

49:07.732 --> 49:09.331
Are you coming with us?

49:09.366 --> 49:10.900
I need to talk to your dad, okay?

49:12.169 --> 49:14.269
Give us a sec, okay?

49:20.310 --> 49:22.778
- You came.
- I love you.

49:22.813 --> 49:25.180
I love you too. That's
why this is gonna work.

49:25.215 --> 49:28.250
Eric, I'm not coming with you.

49:29.186 --> 49:30.185
What?

49:30.220 --> 49:33.454
I need you to turn yourself in.

49:34.824 --> 49:36.925
- No.
- I talked to a lawyer.

49:36.960 --> 49:39.060
I talked to a lawyer
who can represent you.

49:39.095 --> 49:41.262
With all the extenuating circumstances,

49:41.297 --> 49:44.265
with Hope in jail, he says
that they'll go light on you.

49:44.300 --> 49:46.601
Yes, you will do some time,

49:46.636 --> 49:48.903
but only two or three years.

49:48.939 --> 49:50.638
Prison?

49:50.674 --> 49:52.073
Yes.

49:52.108 --> 49:54.408
But then you can stop all this running,

49:54.444 --> 49:57.178
Will doesn't have to be afraid anymore,

49:57.213 --> 49:59.280
and you can both get your life back.

49:59.315 --> 50:01.883
A life where we can be together.

50:04.454 --> 50:07.020
Even if I was willing to,

50:07.056 --> 50:09.056
I don't have anybody
to take care of him.

50:09.091 --> 50:10.457
I got him.

50:11.727 --> 50:16.063
We'll be waiting for
you when you come home.

50:24.324 --> 50:26.392
Are you sure?

50:34.902 --> 50:38.003
Well, I always wanted to be a dad.

50:38.038 --> 50:39.905
But I didn't think I'd
start with a 19-year-old.

51:35.995 --> 51:39.263
What are we gonna do when we move to DC?

51:45.004 --> 51:47.437
What? No, no, no, no.

51:52.411 --> 51:53.878
You're staying for one kid?

52:08.794 --> 52:11.127
I am in awe of you.

52:11.163 --> 52:13.597
Do you know that?

52:22.641 --> 52:25.041
- I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
- Thanks.

52:25.077 --> 52:27.477
But I'm glad you stood up for yourself.

52:27.513 --> 52:29.213
Yeah, me too.

52:29.248 --> 52:31.380
It made me appreciate how lucky I am.

52:31.416 --> 52:32.981
I have so much support

52:33.017 --> 52:35.951
that it's easy to forget
there's a huge part of the world

52:35.986 --> 52:37.953
who still think like Dr. Bannon.

52:37.988 --> 52:40.889
Yeah, well, hopefully they're
going the way of the dinosaur.

52:40.925 --> 52:43.459
Obviously, I won't take the job.

52:43.494 --> 52:45.695
Wait, you got the internship?

52:45.730 --> 52:48.664
Yeah, lucky me, right?

52:48.700 --> 52:50.333
Mingo, you have to take it.

52:50.368 --> 52:52.435
No way. I'm not gonna work for some jerk

52:52.470 --> 52:54.169
that's got his head so far up his ass,

52:54.205 --> 52:55.904
he can't see how special you are.

52:55.940 --> 52:58.374
I appreciate that, I really do,

52:58.409 --> 52:59.942
but jerk or not,

52:59.977 --> 53:01.909
he's the best in the country.

53:01.945 --> 53:04.112
No, you could learn so much from him

53:04.147 --> 53:06.715
and maybe you could teach
him a thing or two on the way.

53:06.750 --> 53:09.751
Yeah. Yeah, you're totally right.

53:09.786 --> 53:12.019
I could be, like, a
spy behind enemy lines,

53:12.055 --> 53:15.323
slowly chipping away at
his discriminatory armor.

53:15.359 --> 53:17.559
My hero.

53:21.265 --> 53:22.530
Sorry.

53:22.566 --> 53:25.267
I... I broke up with Amy.

53:25.302 --> 53:26.901
Wait, what? When?

53:26.936 --> 53:29.337
A couple of weeks ago. I...

53:29.373 --> 53:31.373
I told her I was in love

53:31.408 --> 53:33.440
with someone else.

53:33.476 --> 53:36.644
But when I asked you a few days ago...

53:36.679 --> 53:38.780
I knew about you and Chris,

53:38.815 --> 53:41.082
and I didn't want to
look like a total loser.

53:41.117 --> 53:43.617
Chris and I are just friends.

53:45.388 --> 53:46.687
Seriously?

53:46.722 --> 53:48.122
Seriously.

53:48.158 --> 53:51.159
I didn't want to look like I was single

53:51.194 --> 53:52.726
if you had a girlfriend.

53:55.198 --> 53:56.931
You know what?

53:58.134 --> 54:00.567
We deserve each other.

54:00.603 --> 54:02.270
For sure.

54:02.305 --> 54:04.705
Can I kiss you now?

54:04.740 --> 54:06.740
Please?

54:45.080 --> 54:46.645
I heard.

54:46.680 --> 54:49.648
Well, it looks like
you're moving to Japan.

55:02.363 --> 55:03.996
And you're gonna be

55:04.031 --> 55:06.265
a famous photojournalist,

55:06.300 --> 55:08.000
traveling all over,

55:08.035 --> 55:10.336
documenting important world events.

55:14.074 --> 55:16.941
And I'll get to say,

55:16.977 --> 55:18.676
"I knew him.

55:20.380 --> 55:24.048
He was my first love."

56:16.335 --> 56:18.402
See you around.

56:42.894 --> 56:45.027
- Oh my goodness, Mom.
- Oh, wow!

56:45.063 --> 56:47.263
Ta-dah!

56:47.298 --> 56:49.599
It's a DNA party.

56:51.603 --> 56:53.069
That's got to be the first DNA party

56:53.104 --> 56:54.971
in the history of the world.

56:55.006 --> 56:57.173
Oh, my god.

56:58.176 --> 56:59.442
Thank you.

57:05.350 --> 57:07.316
Bay.

57:07.352 --> 57:09.318
Can I talk to you for a second?

57:09.354 --> 57:10.919
Sure.

57:10.955 --> 57:14.256
Sweetie, I'm your dad

57:14.292 --> 57:16.658
and I'm always gonna worry about you.

57:16.694 --> 57:18.927
And I don't know that world.

57:18.963 --> 57:22.064
You know, I can't pull strings
for you. I can't help you.

57:22.100 --> 57:23.932
But I don't need your help.

57:23.968 --> 57:25.434
I'm making my own way.

57:25.470 --> 57:27.836
Yeah, you are.

57:27.872 --> 57:31.073
That's the Vasquez in you.

57:32.576 --> 57:34.676
I'm a Kennish too, Daddy.

57:45.623 --> 57:48.423
Hey, why does this say "goodbye"?

57:49.960 --> 57:51.727
What's going on?

57:52.863 --> 57:54.696
I've decided to move out.

57:54.732 --> 57:56.632
- Wait, wait, what?
- No!

57:56.667 --> 57:58.299
You don't have to do that.

57:58.335 --> 58:00.101
Thank you.

58:00.137 --> 58:03.005
I'm buying a place in East Riverside.

58:03.040 --> 58:06.742
And I will be raising Eric's son Will

58:06.777 --> 58:09.511
until Eric gets out of prison.

58:11.281 --> 58:13.048
That's amazing.

58:13.083 --> 58:15.482
Yeah, it'll be nice to have
another kid in the family.

58:15.518 --> 58:17.752
Yeah, it will be.

58:19.488 --> 58:22.957
Oh, sweetheart.

58:25.261 --> 58:26.994
I couldn't live here forever.

58:27.030 --> 58:29.030
Why not?

58:29.065 --> 58:32.700
I am so glad I found you.

58:32.735 --> 58:34.334
Do you know that?

58:36.238 --> 58:39.206
And I am so sorry

58:39.241 --> 58:41.308
for all the time I missed.

58:48.317 --> 58:50.183
Sweetie, oh.

58:50.218 --> 58:52.886
Sometimes I think about

58:52.921 --> 58:55.221
what if it never came out?

58:55.256 --> 58:57.891
What if we spent our whole lives

58:57.926 --> 58:59.926
and never met?

59:05.433 --> 59:08.201
I think we should all just be grateful

59:08.236 --> 59:12.005
that Bay was a determined child

59:12.040 --> 59:15.609
who always knew what was best for her,

59:15.644 --> 59:18.845
even thought most of us
were a few steps behind.

59:20.381 --> 59:25.084
I just need to get
clear on something else.

59:25.119 --> 59:27.086
Daphne,

59:27.121 --> 59:29.688
whatever you do

59:29.724 --> 59:33.125
and whoever you turn out to be,

59:33.160 --> 59:35.995
I will always

59:36.030 --> 59:40.198
be so proud

59:40.234 --> 59:42.001
of you.

59:44.105 --> 59:46.171
Thanks, Dad.

59:48.075 --> 59:50.609
Oh, sweetie.

59:54.649 --> 59:56.748
I've been thinking,

59:56.783 --> 59:59.717
maybe I could call you Mom,

59:59.753 --> 01:00:01.653
if that's okay with you two.

01:00:20.707 --> 01:00:24.375
Well, this turned into
a super depressing night.

01:00:28.281 --> 01:00:31.882
This has been an amazing five years.

01:00:35.788 --> 01:00:39.589
And now you guys can
have the guesthouse.

01:00:40.693 --> 01:00:42.192
- Oh, my gosh!
- Wow!

01:00:42.227 --> 01:00:44.427
Oh, thank you.

01:00:47.966 --> 01:00:51.434
All right, now how about we all
just stop this blubbering and eat?

01:00:51.469 --> 01:00:53.503
- Yeah.
- Yes!

01:00:53.538 --> 01:00:55.839
Actually, before we sit,

01:00:55.874 --> 01:00:59.109
there's a comet that's supposed
to be going over us tonight.

01:00:59.144 --> 01:01:01.745
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I read about that.

01:01:02.848 --> 01:01:04.614
The trees are blocking the view.

01:01:04.649 --> 01:01:07.149
- Let's go out on the front lawn.
- Okay, let's do it.

01:01:07.185 --> 01:01:09.085
Yeah. Hey, buddy.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.587
- Come here.
- Come on.

01:01:10.622 --> 01:01:12.088
Let's put this around you.

01:01:16.928 --> 01:01:20.096
So how rare is this exactly?

01:01:20.131 --> 01:01:22.198
I read that we'll probably
only get to see this

01:01:22.234 --> 01:01:23.433
once in a lifetime.

01:01:23.468 --> 01:01:25.702
- Hmm.
- Oh, my gosh, that's so cool.

01:01:25.737 --> 01:01:27.670
- Let's lay down.
- Okay.

01:01:28.906 --> 01:01:32.342
Apparently this is, like, a big deal.

01:01:32.377 --> 01:01:34.944
Like, it hardly ever happens.

01:01:36.748 --> 01:01:39.281
I guess we're all just really lucky.
