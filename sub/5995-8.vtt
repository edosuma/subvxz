00:00.901 --> 00:03.003
(thunder crashing)
(ship creaking)

00:26.094 --> 00:28.096
*

00:54.155 --> 00:55.689
(thunder rumbling)
(sputters)

00:55.723 --> 00:57.591
Ja.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.493
("We Wish You a Merry Christmas"
playing)

00:59.527 --> 01:02.130
(humming)

01:07.668 --> 01:09.270
(sighs)

01:10.871 --> 01:13.641
("We Wish You a Merry Christmas"
stops)

01:13.674 --> 01:16.444
(clarinet plays jaunty tune)

01:26.487 --> 01:27.888
Chanukah.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.423
Hanukah.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.459
Hanuk-kah.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.463
Which one of you is right?

01:37.498 --> 01:39.467
(sighs)

01:39.500 --> 01:42.770
* I was working hard
at a New York job *

01:42.803 --> 01:44.605
* Making dough
but it made me blue *

01:44.638 --> 01:46.274
* One day I was crying a lot

01:46.307 --> 01:47.541
* And so I decided to move

01:47.575 --> 01:49.210
* To West Covina, California

01:49.243 --> 01:50.478
* Brand-new pals
and new career *

01:50.511 --> 01:52.480
* It happens to be
where Josh lives *

01:52.513 --> 01:55.349
* But that's not why I'm here

01:55.383 --> 01:57.485
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *
What? No, I'm not.

01:57.518 --> 01:58.919
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

01:58.952 --> 02:00.521
That's a sexist term.

02:00.554 --> 02:01.822
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

02:01.855 --> 02:03.257
Can you guys stop singing
for just a second?

02:03.291 --> 02:05.693
* She's so broken inside *

02:05.726 --> 02:07.195
The situation's a lot more
nuanced than that.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.197
* C-R-A-Z-Y *

02:09.229 --> 02:10.564
Okay! We get it!

02:10.598 --> 02:13.234
* Crazy ex-girlfriend. *

02:13.267 --> 02:15.169
(indistinct chatter)

02:22.743 --> 02:23.944
I hate being a grown-up

02:23.977 --> 02:25.413
during the holidays.
Work has me

02:25.446 --> 02:26.914
on double shifts this week.
I'm not even gonna get

02:26.947 --> 02:29.783
to go to the Winter Wonderland.
Gonna miss the fake snow,

02:29.817 --> 02:33.321
the fake presents,
the fake trees.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.922
That's the real Christmas.

02:34.955 --> 02:37.791
Dude, have a nog.

02:37.825 --> 02:40.328
I feel you. The
holidays can suck.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.930
I have to spend the day shopping
for gifts for my mother

02:42.963 --> 02:45.933
who walked out on me
and my evil twin half-siblings.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.269
Geez, why do they need
more toys?

02:48.302 --> 02:50.271
Nutmeg me.
I don't know.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.240
Maybe 'cause they're greedy.
'Cause they're brats.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.242
From Beverly Hills. 'Cause
they're terrible human beings.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.244
It's the one day of the year

02:56.277 --> 02:57.978
my mother trots out Greg.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.914
"Everybody, come gather round.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.983
"Greg works in a bar.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.819
Tell us what it's like
to be poor, Greg."

03:05.853 --> 03:07.721
Man, the holidays blow
when you're old.

03:07.755 --> 03:08.989
(scoffs)
I'm not even allowed to sit

03:09.022 --> 03:11.225
on Santa's lap anymore.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.826
Uh, that's just one
of the coaches dressed up.

03:12.860 --> 03:13.861
He'll probably let you.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.700
*

03:23.737 --> 03:25.239
(elevator bell dings)

03:27.007 --> 03:29.510
Oh, by the way,
happy holidays.
Oh.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.012
Or should I say,
 "chag sameach"?

03:32.045 --> 03:34.282
You a little phlegmy there?

03:34.315 --> 03:36.950
No. That's "happy
Hanukkah" in Hebrew.

03:36.984 --> 03:40.821
Oh.
I'm very tight with my Krav
Maga instructor, Gilad.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.756
(grunting)

03:42.790 --> 03:44.592
He's killed people
with his thighs.

03:44.625 --> 03:48.362
Yes, the Sabras
are a fierce people.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.864
So, I heard back from the
San Gabriel County Commission,

03:50.898 --> 03:53.267
Mm-hmm.
and they said, since there are
no indigenous wildlife

03:53.301 --> 03:55.669
in your proposed industrial park
other than a pigeon--

03:55.703 --> 03:57.538
but screw pigeons--
you're free to build.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.039
You are amazing.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.009
I have attorneys in major cities
all over this world--

04:02.042 --> 04:04.312
Cincinnati, Shreveport,
Tallahassee--

04:04.345 --> 04:06.347
and you are numero uno.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.982
Grazie, signore.
Mmm.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.351
Oh. Paula.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.052
Hey. Calvin.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.521
Hey.

04:13.554 --> 04:14.855
How's everything?

04:14.888 --> 04:16.790
How's that new
grief support group?

04:16.824 --> 04:20.060
Well, uh, they serve a
substandard cheddar and generic

04:20.093 --> 04:22.896
chocolate chip cookies,
but the sharing and...

04:22.930 --> 04:25.899
the grieving is great.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.034
(chuckles)
Oh, okay.

04:27.067 --> 04:30.838
I need a moment. Excuse me.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.742
(exhales)

04:34.775 --> 04:37.345
I can't believe I almost slept
with that guy.
Yeah.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.647
Hey, wait a second.
You're wearing panty hose. Ew.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.815
(gasps)
Is that because your mom
is coming?

04:41.849 --> 04:44.918
Well, I just don't want her
to complain and kvetch about

04:44.952 --> 04:46.420
how I'm not
wearing panty hose.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.056
And I just... I just
want to shut it down.
Okay.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.859
Also, again, I'm not trying
to please her. Or anyone.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.395
Sure.
But when you meet her,
don't mention

04:54.428 --> 04:55.563
that Josh Chan lives here.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.498
Because if she hears that,
she might get the wrong idea

04:57.531 --> 04:59.400
and think that I moved here
for him.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.368
Which you did.
Not.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.835
Okay, well, I'll do my best,

05:01.869 --> 05:04.104
but I'm not gonna magically
change to please your mother.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.940
That's not what I'm trying
to do.
It's not?

05:06.974 --> 05:07.975
I'm not trying to please her.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.843
I'm not even picking her up
from the airport.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.780
I offered, but she said I drive

05:12.813 --> 05:15.115
like the grandma she's starting
to think she'll never be.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.650
Come on.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.986
I can see right through you.
You are a mom pleaser.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.355
A level five mom pleaser.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.757
You will say anything
to make that woman happy.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.759
That's not true. That's not...

05:25.793 --> 05:27.127
that's not true at all.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.829
YOUNG REBECCA:
 Morning, Mom!

05:28.862 --> 05:30.464
Poached eggs,

05:30.498 --> 05:32.600
slightly hard. Your favorite!

05:32.633 --> 05:35.603
I'm three pounds over.
We're not eating eggs.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.772
What are you talking about?
You don't look any pounds over.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.107
You look great.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.442
You know,

05:41.475 --> 05:42.943
I was talking
to Principal Kessler,

05:42.976 --> 05:44.144
and he said
he thought

05:44.177 --> 05:46.146
you were the prettiest
and youngest mom

05:46.179 --> 05:47.948
in my whole grade.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.850
Just your grade?

05:49.883 --> 05:52.786
No, no, no.
He said the whole school.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.054
Why are you even
telling me this?

05:54.087 --> 05:55.523
Principal Kessler's married.

05:56.156 --> 05:58.459
But I heard his wife is frigid.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.594
Go on.

06:00.628 --> 06:03.697
All right, I used to be a mom
pleaser, but I'm not anymore.

06:03.731 --> 06:06.434
I'm not gonna lie to
feed into her dysfunction.

06:06.467 --> 06:09.770
Who cares? Who cares what an
old lady thinks about your life?

06:09.803 --> 06:11.505
Not me! I'm a grown-up!

06:11.539 --> 06:14.508
Yes. And nothing sells that
better than yelling,

06:14.542 --> 06:15.776
"I'm a grown-up!"

06:18.546 --> 06:20.581
*

06:21.615 --> 06:23.417
(doorbell rings, knocking)
(sighs)

06:26.219 --> 06:28.422
(sighs)

06:30.491 --> 06:34.127
* Where's the bathroom?

06:34.161 --> 06:36.797
* Where's the bathroom?
I need to use the bathroom *

06:36.830 --> 06:38.532
* Tell me that you have
a bathroom *

06:38.566 --> 06:40.434
* In this hovel
you call home *

06:40.468 --> 06:41.902
* I don't know
which was bumpier *

06:41.935 --> 06:43.437
* The plane ride or the taxi

06:43.471 --> 06:45.439
* All these freeways
are a nightmare *

06:45.473 --> 06:46.807
* Where's my purse?
I need my comb *

06:46.840 --> 06:48.909
* By the way

06:48.942 --> 06:51.512
* You're looking healthy
and by healthy, I mean chunky *

06:51.545 --> 06:53.547
* I don't mean that
as an insult *

06:53.581 --> 06:54.748
* I'm just stating it as fact

06:56.216 --> 06:58.652
* I see your eczema
is back *

06:58.686 --> 07:01.622
* Are you using the lotion
that I sent you? *

07:01.655 --> 07:05.158
* If you're not gonna use it,
I'll return it to the store *

07:05.192 --> 07:08.629
* God, I give you
everything *

07:08.662 --> 07:11.565
* And still you just want
more, more, more, more, more *

07:13.601 --> 07:16.737
* Where's the bathroom?
Where's the bathroom? *

07:16.770 --> 07:19.106
* You haven't told me
where your bathroom is *

07:19.139 --> 07:20.107
It's upstairs.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.709
* Okay, fine, I need the walk

07:22.910 --> 07:25.579
* Well, your house is
dot, dot, dot charming *

07:25.613 --> 07:26.914
* Though some florals
wouldn't kill you *

07:26.947 --> 07:28.849
* Do you ever get a maid here?

07:28.882 --> 07:30.718
* It's so nice
to sit and talk *

07:30.751 --> 07:33.587
* Since when do you have
a vendetta against vases? *

07:33.621 --> 07:34.888
* When did you stop
wearing makeup? *

07:34.922 --> 07:36.557
* Are you sure
that you're not gay? *

07:36.590 --> 07:39.560
* I'd still love you
if you were gay *

07:39.593 --> 07:41.595
* It would explain
this vase vendetta *

07:41.629 --> 07:43.597
* Please just tell me
if you're gay *

07:43.631 --> 07:45.032
Again, I am not gay!

07:45.065 --> 07:48.569
* Don't interrupt me

07:48.602 --> 07:50.938
* You're always
with the talking *

07:50.971 --> 07:52.940
* I just got off a plane

07:52.973 --> 07:55.843
* Give me a moment
to catch my breath *

07:55.876 --> 07:58.979
* It's the least you can do

07:59.012 --> 08:01.649
* Since you lived inside me

08:01.682 --> 08:03.751
* For nine months,
and you still *

08:03.784 --> 08:06.186
* Haven't told me

08:06.219 --> 08:09.590
* Where the hell
your stupid bathroom is *

08:09.623 --> 08:10.958
Again, it's upstairs!

08:10.991 --> 08:13.727
Oh, right. Thank you.

08:13.761 --> 08:15.763
*

08:22.169 --> 08:23.671
(toilet flushes)

08:29.342 --> 08:31.712
* You call that a bathroom?

08:31.745 --> 08:33.046
* That's what passes
for a bathroom? *

08:33.080 --> 08:34.648
* There were no bowls of rocks

08:34.682 --> 08:35.948
* Or any decorative soaps

08:35.982 --> 08:37.684
* You don't even have
a bath mat, who doesn't *

08:37.717 --> 08:40.688
* Have a bath mat? If you need
a bath mat, I can... Oh *

08:40.721 --> 08:42.890
* Did you hear?
A bishop in Wisconsin *

08:42.923 --> 08:45.693
* Said something anti-Semitic
so the temple has decided *

08:45.726 --> 08:47.561
* To boycott cheddar cheese

08:47.595 --> 08:48.762
* Everyone asks
how you're doing *

08:48.796 --> 08:51.565
* "How is wittle Becky? Is she
still a big-shot lawyer?" *

08:51.599 --> 08:54.568
* And to that I just say,
"Please" *

08:54.602 --> 08:55.603
* You won't get a husband
this way *

08:55.636 --> 08:57.004
* At least
you have your career *

08:57.037 --> 08:58.606
* Oh, wait,
you threw out your career *

08:58.639 --> 09:00.007
* To chase
this California dream *

09:00.040 --> 09:02.943
* I wasted all that dough
on Harvard and Yale *

09:02.976 --> 09:04.612
* For you to be

09:04.645 --> 09:07.014
* Living in a dump
in Nowhere, USA *

09:07.047 --> 09:09.717
* Getting fatter by the minute
on this greasy goyish food *

09:09.750 --> 09:11.251
* Just put my luggage
in my room *

09:11.284 --> 09:12.686
* Could I get a glass
of water? *

09:12.720 --> 09:14.354
* I'll be back in a moment

09:14.387 --> 09:16.223
* I need to use the bathroom

09:17.625 --> 09:19.693
* Again!

09:22.663 --> 09:25.298
(sighs)
It's so hot in California
right now.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.635
I can tolerate the Christmas
crap when there's snow

09:27.668 --> 09:29.336
on the ground, a nip
in the air. (chuckles)

09:29.369 --> 09:31.104
You know, your frenemy,
Audra Levine,

09:31.138 --> 09:33.006
she just bought
a country house upstate.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.108
It is so cozy.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.845
Now, she knows how to do winter.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.247
You know, Mom,
I know this place is different,

09:40.280 --> 09:41.982
but once you get to know it,

09:42.015 --> 09:43.684
I think
you're really gonna like it.

09:43.717 --> 09:44.918
For the life of me, honey,

09:44.952 --> 09:46.353
I don't understand
why you moved here.

09:46.386 --> 09:47.988
Do you have
one good reason?

09:48.021 --> 09:49.690
What is so good
about California?

09:49.723 --> 09:51.224
You know, Mom,
it's not very nice to, like,

09:51.258 --> 09:52.760
blow in here with a bunch
of criticisms.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.128
Okay, okay. I'm exhausted.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.864
Yeah, why are you going
to sleep right now?

09:56.897 --> 09:58.632
It's still light out.
In New York,

09:58.666 --> 10:02.602
it's way past my bedtime.
I already took my sleeping pill.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.705
For once,

10:04.738 --> 10:06.273
put yourself in my shoes.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.108
(sighs)

10:08.141 --> 10:10.143
("Jingle Bells" playing)

10:16.717 --> 10:19.019
The mall's about to close.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.288
I just need to grab something
for two kids who are either six

10:21.321 --> 10:24.792
or, uh... Maybe they're 15?

10:24.825 --> 10:26.393
You are a terrible father.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.961
Hey, I know you.

10:27.995 --> 10:31.064
You're Rebecca's
neighbor, right?

10:31.098 --> 10:34.434
I met you at
her party.
Oh. You got really drunk,

10:34.467 --> 10:36.670
and then you slow-danced
with that giant fish.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.005
(giggles):
Oh.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.073
That didn't happen.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.241
No, it did--
I have pictures.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.143
I saw you ask it
to go home with you.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.879
Does this present say,
"Our mom sucks,

10:45.913 --> 10:48.882
but I'm gonna try very hard
not to hold it against you"?

10:48.916 --> 10:51.719
No. It says you're old and
still think kids play outside.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.788
Right.
So, do you need a gift
for your mom, too?

10:54.822 --> 10:57.758
Uh, no. I'm gonna get her the
same gift I get her every year:

10:57.791 --> 11:01.695
my presence at her overly lavish
Christmas Eve Eve dinner.

11:01.729 --> 11:03.897
Wait. Overly lavish?
Big holiday dinner?

11:03.931 --> 11:05.799
What's the meat sitch?
Turkey, ham,

11:05.833 --> 11:07.267
roast beef, shrimp, salmon?

11:07.300 --> 11:10.070
Oh, all of it.
It's so over the top,
it's embarrassing.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.805
Can you bring someone?

11:13.941 --> 11:18.345
Okay, just to be clear,
I didn't invite you. But...

11:18.378 --> 11:20.714
that's a great idea.

11:20.748 --> 11:23.483
I'll finally have a
witness to the insanity.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.786
Right. So what's your name?

11:26.486 --> 11:28.789
*
(horns honking)

11:28.822 --> 11:30.791
(elevator bell dings)

11:30.824 --> 11:33.126
Okay, Mom, this is
Whitefeather & Associates.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.328
And yes, those are
Christmas decorations.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.031
Where's the menorah?
There's no menorah.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.167
Good news. I settled
the big parking lot case.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.435
All the plaintiffs
are getting four dollars.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.438
If they can find
their parking receipts.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.107
Good. Hey, it's good.
Yeah?

11:47.140 --> 11:48.275
Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.843
He's a good lawyer.
Thanks.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.344
JIM:
Spoiler alert.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.480
I'm your Secret Santa, Bunch.
Two pairs of panty hose,

11:53.513 --> 11:55.749
so I don't have to look
at those unshaven stems.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.384
Creamy...

11:57.417 --> 11:59.787
and Sand Storm.
(chuckles)

11:59.820 --> 12:01.755
He's joking

12:01.789 --> 12:03.757
because I'm known for
always wearing panty hose.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.192
It's a funny joke.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.326
Darryl!

12:06.359 --> 12:08.461
Come meet my mother.
Hi.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.329
Look, this
is important.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.531
No one is wearing
a Christmas sweater.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.500
Why isn't anyone wearing
a Christmas sweater?

12:13.533 --> 12:16.069
It is National
Christmas Sweater Day!

12:16.103 --> 12:18.338
Whatever.

12:20.540 --> 12:21.541
Well?

12:21.574 --> 12:24.845
You said not to criticize,
so I'm not criticizing.

12:24.878 --> 12:25.946
Well, that in itself
is criticizing.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.280
You know that.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.416
All I know is that
I gave up law school

12:29.449 --> 12:30.517
and sacrificed my dreams

12:30.550 --> 12:32.219
for you,
and in New York,

12:32.252 --> 12:35.088
you worked in a skyscraper
with Audra Levine,

12:35.122 --> 12:36.456
and now you are here.

12:36.489 --> 12:37.791
But I support

12:37.825 --> 12:39.893
all your whacky decisions,

12:39.927 --> 12:41.995
like working here

12:42.029 --> 12:44.031
with these losers...
(sighs)

12:44.064 --> 12:46.299
(echoing):
 losers... losers... losers...

12:46.333 --> 12:47.500
Your friends are losers.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.069
Your father is a loser.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.537
You, my dear, are a loser.

12:50.570 --> 12:53.473
(echoing):
 ...loser... loser... loser...

12:53.506 --> 12:56.910
Wait. You think this is
where I actually work?

12:56.944 --> 12:59.379
Oh, yes.
I...

12:59.412 --> 13:01.448
I misspoke.
I don't work here.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.216
What?
No, no, I'm sorry.
God, that was misleading.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.085
I don't work here.
I was bringing you by...

13:05.118 --> 13:07.587
What?
(whispers): I volunteer
here part-time.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.555
(laughs):
Oh, my God.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.323
I mentor
underprivileged lawyers,

13:10.357 --> 13:11.825
and I was bringing
my mother by

13:11.859 --> 13:14.094
so that they'd
feel included.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.528
Underprivileged lawyers?
Underpr...

13:15.562 --> 13:16.529
It's-it's very
complicated. It's...

13:16.563 --> 13:17.898
Sounds like an oxymoron.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.099
Hold on. Watch. Um,

13:19.132 --> 13:20.300
Whitefeather employees,

13:20.333 --> 13:21.869
attention, attention.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.904
It's nice to see
your smiling faces out there.

13:23.937 --> 13:27.975
Thank you. I just want to
say that I believe in you,

13:28.008 --> 13:30.610
you can do anything
you set your mind to,

13:30.643 --> 13:32.846
and live your dreams.
Happy holidays.

13:32.880 --> 13:33.947
Okay, let's go.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.148
Let's leave.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.285
That was good.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.887
Get the door.
Here you go.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.955
I know I said I wouldn't
make any comments,

13:41.989 --> 13:43.957
but, uh, I breathe a
big sigh of relief

13:43.991 --> 13:45.592
that that wasn't
your office.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.494
Oh, my gosh, I can't...
That is so funny

13:47.527 --> 13:48.595
that you thought
that was my office.

13:48.628 --> 13:49.863
Uh-huh.
No. My firm,

13:49.897 --> 13:51.198
I wish you could see it.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.599
It's over on East Cameron,
which is basically

13:52.632 --> 13:54.434
the Park Avenue of West Covina.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.337
Yeah, and I would've
taken you there, but...

13:57.370 --> 14:00.007
they are closed for Hanukkah.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.410
What?
I work at a very
observant Jewish firm,

14:03.443 --> 14:05.979
and all of them are
in Israel right now,

14:06.013 --> 14:09.216
and I was invited, too,
but I wanted to be here for you.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.517
Wow.
Yeah.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.886
Oh, they're mensches.
And they're in Mensa.

14:12.920 --> 14:13.786
Oh, my God!

14:13.820 --> 14:16.089
Yeah, my life is
just filled with winners.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.225
Specifically, who?
Uh...

14:18.258 --> 14:21.962
well.... the VIP we're
having lunch with today.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.463
Who's that?

14:23.496 --> 14:25.032
(elevator bell dings)

14:25.665 --> 14:27.267
Paula. Paula.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.268
(snapping fingers)
Paula.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.070
Okay, I need you to do
me the biggest favor.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.039
I need you to come to lunch
with me and my mom

14:32.072 --> 14:33.473
and pretend to be someone
different, someone, like, fancy.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.507
What?

14:34.541 --> 14:36.509
Thank you so much.
Okay, Mom likes kitten heels,

14:36.543 --> 14:37.744
so change into that,
and she also likes Jews.

14:37.777 --> 14:40.213
I guess there's not much you
can do about that by lunchtime.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.915
(imitating siren):
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

14:41.949 --> 14:43.951
Level five mom-pleaser alert.
Whoo, whoo...

14:43.984 --> 14:45.285
Hey. You're right. You win.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.587
I'm a total mom pleaser.
Just make me seem awesome.

14:47.620 --> 14:48.521
Okay?

14:48.555 --> 14:50.357
(sighs) Turns out my
real life is garbage,

14:50.390 --> 14:52.159
but my fake life is amazing!

14:52.192 --> 14:54.127
Thank you. You're the best.
See you soon.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.502
*

15:06.239 --> 15:07.440
(indistinct chatter)

15:07.474 --> 15:10.377
So, yeah, I had
to break up with him. I know.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.512
He was a Saudi prince,
but he wouldn't convert,

15:12.545 --> 15:13.947
and that's a deal breaker
for me.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.648
He was so upset
when I told him.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.217
You should have seen his face.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.386
He couldn't drag-race
his Porsche for weeks afterward.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.154
Why was a prince in West Covina?

15:21.188 --> 15:22.655
He wanted to buy it.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.424
Lovely man.
We still text sometimes.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.993
He owns texting.

15:26.026 --> 15:26.994
What?
Mm-hmm.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.062
Oh.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.565
That's a strange wave.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.567
She isn't strange, is she?

15:34.601 --> 15:36.736
You never made
the most normal friends.

15:36.769 --> 15:37.904
She's not strange.
She's actually...

15:37.937 --> 15:42.675
(British accent):
Hello! Lovely to meet you,
my dear.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.344
British. She's British.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.346
That's the surprise.
Surprise.

15:46.379 --> 15:49.983
(laughs) Rebecca didn't tell me
she had a friend from England.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.751
Now, that's very interesting.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.719
Mmm.
Yes.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.055
So, Paula is from London Town,

15:55.088 --> 15:56.523
I guess.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.091
Uh, and she grew up...

15:58.758 --> 16:00.393
...on Abbey Road.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.129
Abbey Road?
Yes.

16:02.162 --> 16:05.398
I was literally born
on the crosswalk.

16:05.432 --> 16:08.301
(laughs)
My mum couldn't make it
to hospital.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.102
(laughs)

16:09.136 --> 16:10.437
True story.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.739
Well, how do you
like it here in...

16:12.772 --> 16:15.042
California?
Oh, California.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.476
California.
It's a cultural wasteland.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.478
Yes.
And the way
they do holidays here,

16:18.511 --> 16:21.114
I mean,
it's completely arse about face.

16:21.148 --> 16:24.751
(laughs)
And it is tough to drink hot
toddies when you're shvitzing.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.153
(Paula and Naomi laugh)

16:26.186 --> 16:28.088
Oh, I'm Jewish, by the way.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.089
You're Jewish?
Yes.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.290
A British Jew?
Yes!

16:30.323 --> 16:32.059
That is fabulous.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.426
British Jew.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.662
Tea and matzo, anyone?

16:35.695 --> 16:37.264
(laughs)
You're funny.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.731
Well, since
you're British,

16:38.765 --> 16:41.068
we must do tea,
even if it's iced.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.369
So I'll go tell the waiter.

16:42.402 --> 16:43.803
Lovely.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.273
Waiter!
Hello! Hello!

16:49.076 --> 16:51.378
So, you're British.
Yeah.

16:51.411 --> 16:52.812
And you hate California.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.481
Hey. You said to be impressive.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.349
And I took
a corporate improv class,

16:56.383 --> 16:57.817
and they told us
to make bold choices.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.352
So don't you criticize.

16:59.386 --> 17:00.587
I am doing you
a huge favor,

17:00.620 --> 17:03.356
'cause you know I don't approve
of this whole codependent...

17:03.390 --> 17:06.559
(British accent):
charade. Or your schedule,

17:06.593 --> 17:09.096
your aluminium, your vitamins.

17:09.128 --> 17:11.131
Oh, bollocks!
It's so difficult to stop

17:11.164 --> 17:13.266
once you get started.
(normal voice): Cookie,

17:13.300 --> 17:16.069
you don't get it.
There is no lie

17:16.103 --> 17:18.271
that you can tell this woman
that will get her approval.

17:18.305 --> 17:21.108
And it should not matter anyway,
because you are not 15.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.040
I know I'm not 15, okay?

17:22.075 --> 17:24.310
Just stop badgering me
and pestering me.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.113
God, just give me some space.

17:26.146 --> 17:29.116
Paula, the waiter
just told me.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.651
They don't even have
English breakfast tea.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.486
(gasps)
Ghastly.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.556
I bet if you asked him
for a crumpet, he would plotz.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.091
(Paula and Naomi laugh)

17:38.125 --> 17:39.826
(laughs)
Rebecca,

17:39.859 --> 17:42.429
you finally found a friend
who's not a loser.

17:42.462 --> 17:45.165
Finally! After all these...
(British accent): years.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.667
"Years." So-so many...
That's very good.
Years.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.469
Thank you.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.471
*

17:55.442 --> 17:56.743
(sighs)

17:56.776 --> 17:58.411
This is pretty cush.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.347
This? It's tacky.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.749
It has no cultural
integrity.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.818
Unlike West Covina, which is
so historically interesting.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.687
Fair point.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.389
California is vulgar.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.858
(sighs) You ready to be
in The Real Housewives

18:11.891 --> 18:13.726
of the Rich and Famous?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.595
That's not a show.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.198
I know it's not a show.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.133
Greggy!

18:20.167 --> 18:22.202
Hi...
Oh!

18:22.235 --> 18:23.836
Who's this?

18:23.870 --> 18:25.505
My friend.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.340
It's so nice to meet you.
I'm Shauna.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.442
I'm so happy to see
the both of you.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.778
I've been dying for Greg to
bring some friends around.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.613
Because I have no friends.
I got it.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.215
Clocked that. Thanks, Shauna.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.551
I wish you'd call me "Mom."

18:38.585 --> 18:40.287
Come on in.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.654
See what I mean?

18:41.688 --> 18:43.223
Monster.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.258
("Deck the Halls" playing)

18:51.798 --> 18:54.267
Happy holidays!
Happy holidays!

18:54.301 --> 18:56.503
Baby bartenders. Cool.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.937
The drinks are virgin.
We watched, like,

18:57.970 --> 18:59.906
17 YouTube videos
on how to make them.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.641
The kids think it's so cool

19:01.674 --> 19:03.610
that their big brother works
at a bar.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.745
(chuckles) You know,
romanticizing the working class

19:05.778 --> 19:09.282
perpetuates economic
disparity. Right?

19:09.316 --> 19:11.451
I don't know.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.520
I don't think that's what
your mother meant, Greg.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.622
Yeah, there's nothing wrong
with working at a bar.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.825
Though, if you don't want to and
you wanted to go back to school,

19:18.858 --> 19:20.560
Stew and I would be happy
to contribute.
Yeah.

19:20.593 --> 19:23.230
Again, I'm not taking
any money from you guys.

19:23.263 --> 19:26.233
I'm not a freeloader.
Like Mason and Lily.

19:27.734 --> 19:28.568
That's not what I meant.

19:28.601 --> 19:31.404
And-and Mason and Lily
are children.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.672
Are they?

19:32.705 --> 19:35.308
(video game sounds)

19:37.910 --> 19:41.781
So, your fake tree
looks so real.

19:41.814 --> 19:42.782
It is real.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.617
Unlike some people's boobs.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.420
Greg, my boobs are real.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.889
Real expensive.
(laughs)

19:49.922 --> 19:51.791
(laughs)

19:51.824 --> 19:53.260
(laughs)

19:53.293 --> 19:55.595
What? She's hilarious.

19:55.628 --> 19:58.831
("We Wish You a Merry Christmas"
playing)

20:01.601 --> 20:03.870
Um, excuse me.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.273
Are-are you Josh Chan?

20:06.306 --> 20:07.774
Like, the Josh Chan?

20:07.807 --> 20:10.743
I guess so.
I knew it.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.545
You were the captain
of my high school's

20:12.579 --> 20:14.847
'06 national championship
hip-hop team, right?

20:14.881 --> 20:17.384
(chuckles)
I mean, I pass by that
trophy in the hallway,

20:17.417 --> 20:18.651
like, every single day.

20:18.685 --> 20:21.488
Wait, didn't you create
the Swoop Bye-bye?

20:21.521 --> 20:23.323
What, you mean this?
Ooh, pah-kah-kah-kah.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.824
(whoops) Look,

20:24.857 --> 20:26.826
um, I don't want to bother you,

20:26.859 --> 20:28.761
but we're doing a show
for Winter Wonderland.

20:28.795 --> 20:31.331
Would you want to come and
check it out? I mean, we still

20:31.364 --> 20:32.899
do that number
that you choreographed in

20:32.932 --> 20:35.368
your senior year. Maybe you
could come a little early

20:35.402 --> 20:36.636
and give us some tips.

20:36.669 --> 20:37.904
Me? Give you tips?

20:37.937 --> 20:39.739
I don't know if I'm qualified.

20:40.940 --> 20:41.908
(whoops)

20:41.941 --> 20:43.343
Swoop Hello!

20:43.376 --> 20:44.644
So you'll be there?

20:44.677 --> 20:46.913
(chuckles)
I-I have work that day.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.316
Double shift at Aloha Tech.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.618
Man, adult stuff sucks.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.853
Yeah. Yeah. You'll see.
(chuckles)

20:53.886 --> 20:56.923
Well, it was nice
to meet you. Uh...

20:56.956 --> 20:59.492
So, uh, yeah,
good luck with the show.
Oh.

20:59.526 --> 21:00.960
Thanks, Mr. Chan.
Oh, it's...

21:00.993 --> 21:02.729
it's-it's just Josh.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.697
Okay, Mr. Josh.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.502
REBECCA:
 Um, so I know these

21:09.536 --> 21:11.638
latkes are frozen
and, like, oblong,

21:11.671 --> 21:12.972
but they're pretty good.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.307
(muffled): It's good.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.008
Mm-hmm.
You know, I went on a diet

21:16.042 --> 21:18.478
where I didn't
eat carbohydrates for months.
Mm.

21:18.511 --> 21:19.946
And I looked fabulous,

21:19.979 --> 21:21.481
but I passed out
at Bloomingdale's.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.815
In the petite department.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.016
(both laugh)

21:24.050 --> 21:25.685
Ooh.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.854
I got to hit the ladies'.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.590
Room. I ain't
no football player.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.559
(laughing):
I love that joke, Mom.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.394
(sighs)

21:34.427 --> 21:37.530
(door opens and closes)

21:38.931 --> 21:41.668
*

21:44.837 --> 21:46.706
Paula, I think

21:46.739 --> 21:49.942
my mom is about to give me
the Garfinkel ring.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.512
It's been passed down
in my family for generations,

21:52.545 --> 21:54.381
usually every girl gets it
on her 18th birthday,

21:54.414 --> 21:56.082
I did not receive it
on my 18th birthday,

21:56.115 --> 21:57.950
but I think I'm about to get it!

21:57.984 --> 22:00.353
Oh, that stupid ring
that your family

22:00.387 --> 22:01.921
holds onto
like a bunch of hobbits?

22:01.954 --> 22:04.090
Do you really think that bitch
is finally gonna hand it over?

22:04.123 --> 22:05.758
Dude, okay, she's not a bitch.

22:05.792 --> 22:06.626
We're actually getting along.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.895
I really think
we've turned a corner

22:08.928 --> 22:10.630
in our relationship somehow.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.132
Oh, and that ring would be
the last seal of approval.

22:13.165 --> 22:17.003
It's that... that final drop
of mother's milk.

22:17.036 --> 22:18.037
(toilet flushes, door opens)

22:18.070 --> 22:19.606
Oh, she's coming.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.841
I don't want her to be mad. Bye!

22:23.175 --> 22:24.777
Time for gifts.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.479
Oh! Wait, I have
something for you.

22:27.814 --> 22:28.981
Saw this at the mall,
Oh.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.418
and I thought:
pretty and elegant,

22:31.451 --> 22:33.019
just like my mom.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.754
Thank you.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.558
It's crystal.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.496
A crystal...

22:43.530 --> 22:44.997
rectal thermometer?
What?

22:45.031 --> 22:46.833
(laughs): No. No, no.
You put your rings on it.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.935
Why would you put your rings
on a rectal thermometer?

22:48.968 --> 22:50.169
Again, it's not... it's
not a rectal thermometer.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.170
Okay, never mind,
never mind.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.872
At least it looks expensive,

22:52.905 --> 22:55.542
and, uh, I'm going to, uh,

22:55.575 --> 22:57.076
I'm gonna keep it.

22:57.109 --> 22:58.878
And, uh...

22:58.911 --> 23:00.680
now I've got a gift for you.

23:00.713 --> 23:01.881
You do?

23:01.914 --> 23:02.915
Ready?

23:02.949 --> 23:05.017
Uh-huh. Uh, yes.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.663
Oh. (laughs)
Open it.

23:16.696 --> 23:17.664
Okay.

23:17.697 --> 23:18.798
Big.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.500
Oh...
I ran out
this morning.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.134
Now you have your own vase.

23:22.168 --> 23:23.970
I need it. Wonderful.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.672
Thank you.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.774
And...

23:27.807 --> 23:30.610
I brought something else
for you, too.

23:30.643 --> 23:31.844
Really?

23:31.878 --> 23:32.879
I brought it from home.

23:32.912 --> 23:33.980
Yeah?

23:34.013 --> 23:36.048
But, um...

23:36.082 --> 23:37.216
maybe later.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.551
Well, we can do it now.

23:38.585 --> 23:39.619
Right? We can do it...

23:39.652 --> 23:40.787
(phone ringing)
When...

23:40.820 --> 23:41.888
Later.

23:41.921 --> 23:45.858
Uh, hold on. Hold on.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.530
Uh... oh.

23:50.563 --> 23:52.665
Who's that?

23:52.699 --> 23:54.000
He's easy on the eyes.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.235
He's just a client.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.137
But it's the holidays.
I don't have to answer.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.039
Let's go back to that ring.

24:00.072 --> 24:01.040
I mean...
(stammering)

24:01.073 --> 24:03.075
What? Client?

24:03.109 --> 24:04.611
I mean, that's work.
That's important.

24:04.644 --> 24:05.912
No, no, please, go ahead.

24:05.945 --> 24:06.979
Okay.

24:07.013 --> 24:09.716
I'll... I'll be
just one second.

24:09.749 --> 24:10.717
Hi, Calvin.

24:10.750 --> 24:11.884
What's up?

24:11.918 --> 24:12.819
I see.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.721
You know, I'm... I'm
with my mom right now,

24:14.754 --> 24:15.755
so I can't.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.056
Okay. Bye.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.891
That doesn't sound
like a work thing.

24:18.925 --> 24:21.093
That sounds like
secret lover language.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.194
It... No.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.195
So, he's a client,

24:23.229 --> 24:26.566
and he had, um,
an urgent matter with a permit,

24:26.599 --> 24:28.034
and he wanted
to meet with me tonight,

24:28.067 --> 24:29.569
but I can't.

24:29.602 --> 24:30.803
During the holidays?

24:30.837 --> 24:32.539
Doesn't he have
a wife or anything?

24:32.572 --> 24:33.706
He's actually a recent widower.

24:33.740 --> 24:34.774
But I told him no,

24:34.807 --> 24:36.108
so let's get back
to you and me.

24:36.142 --> 24:36.976
No, no, no, no, no, no.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.110
You should go.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.779
What could be more important
than work?

24:39.812 --> 24:43.950
I mean, I feel like some people
would say... family?

24:43.983 --> 24:45.084
You should go.

24:45.818 --> 24:46.819
I'll come with you!

24:46.853 --> 24:48.287
Okay.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.288
Great, great, great.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.557
So what should I wear?

24:50.590 --> 24:52.124
Is he a boob man or a butt man?

24:57.864 --> 24:59.699
(indistinct chatter)

24:59.732 --> 25:01.701
I would love another
glass of wine.

25:01.734 --> 25:02.735
Okay.

25:02.769 --> 25:04.771
Mom, um, that'll be your second.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.038
Let's pace ourselves.

25:06.072 --> 25:08.741
Anyway, let's get
back to my story.

25:08.775 --> 25:12.311
So that is when
I told my little Becca

25:12.344 --> 25:14.146
to close her legs

25:14.180 --> 25:16.616
and stop getting to know

25:16.649 --> 25:19.886
the whole Ivy League
a capella circuit.

25:19.919 --> 25:20.920
(laughs)
Wh...

25:20.953 --> 25:22.154
She's not great with metaphors.

25:22.188 --> 25:23.455
When she says "getting to know,"

25:23.489 --> 25:26.092
she means I was writing an
article on them for the Crimson.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.760
So that baritone
from Cornell

25:27.794 --> 25:30.129
gave you HPV during
an interview?

25:30.162 --> 25:32.164
Mm-hmm.
(sighs)

25:32.198 --> 25:33.332
(chuckling)

25:33.365 --> 25:35.001
What a wonderful anecdote.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.169
Rebecca, I need to talk to you

25:37.203 --> 25:39.338
about the zoning for the
property near the L.A. River.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.641
We need to get that proposal in
before the New Year.

25:41.674 --> 25:43.242
I totally agree, Cal...

25:43.275 --> 25:45.077
And that sounds
pretty, um, dangerous.

25:45.111 --> 25:48.014
What happens
after the end of the year?

25:48.047 --> 25:49.616
Interest rates go up.

25:49.649 --> 25:51.684
Ooh.... interesting.

25:51.718 --> 25:54.353
(both laughing)

25:54.386 --> 25:56.589
("We Wish You a Merry Christmas"
playing)

25:58.791 --> 26:01.160
Yes. Yes.

26:01.193 --> 26:02.629
Outside the box.
Whoa.

26:02.662 --> 26:03.763
What are you doing?

26:03.796 --> 26:06.999
I wanted a witness,
not a turncoat.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.668
Gingerbread houses are fun.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.737
And I could never have one
when I was little,

26:10.770 --> 26:12.672
'cause I get so hyper
from sugar.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.240
Look how hyper I am.

26:14.273 --> 26:15.608
It's not that.

26:15.642 --> 26:18.010
The cozying up to
my family and Shauna.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.779
Yeah, why don't you
call her "Mom"?

26:19.812 --> 26:22.248
The whole "Shauna" thing
is, like, creeping me out.

26:22.281 --> 26:23.950
See, you're taking her side.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.918
You know, the whole reason
that I came here

26:25.952 --> 26:27.754
is 'cause I thought
that you were cute

26:27.787 --> 26:29.321
and that they were going
to be terrible.

26:29.355 --> 26:32.191
But you're terrible
and they're cute.

26:32.224 --> 26:34.661
Did you say...
Who wants
a nog refill?

26:34.694 --> 26:35.762
Okay, what is that
supposed to mean?

26:35.795 --> 26:38.197
See? You're doing it.
Stop.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.767
Sorry, Poopsy over here
hasn't had his nap yet.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.670
Is something burning?

26:43.703 --> 26:44.771
Oh, ooh!

26:44.804 --> 26:46.673
I think I left
cookies in the oven.

26:46.706 --> 26:47.707
Oh, you left something?

26:47.740 --> 26:48.708
Shocker.

26:48.741 --> 26:49.942
Excuse me?

26:49.976 --> 26:51.277
Nothing.

26:51.310 --> 26:52.845
Greg, I think you should tell us

26:52.879 --> 26:53.846
what you meant by that.

26:53.880 --> 26:54.814
Oh, no, don't
get him started.

26:54.847 --> 26:57.049
He's just never gotten over
you leaving him.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.085
Anyways, I know
it's early,

26:59.118 --> 27:00.987
but can I make a to-go plate?

27:02.822 --> 27:04.190
Um, what kind of
material is this?

27:04.223 --> 27:05.357
Oh, it's just
a coat.

27:05.391 --> 27:07.426
Harris tweed?
Uh, some kind of wool.

27:07.459 --> 27:08.360
It's really nice.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.396
Hey, Mom. How about I get you
another drink?

27:10.429 --> 27:12.832
Huh? How about some, uh,
some water? On the rocks?

27:12.865 --> 27:14.266
I'm not drunk, dear.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.703
I'm just having this...
this wonderful time.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.037
I know.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.806
But, you know, I'm finished
working with Calvin,

27:19.839 --> 27:22.008
and I just... I hope
we're not holding him up.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.009
(phone ringing)

27:23.042 --> 27:24.276
Oh. Excuse me.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.312
I need to take this, ladies.

27:26.345 --> 27:27.980
Uh, hello.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.048
Yeah.

27:29.081 --> 27:30.049
Mmm...

27:30.082 --> 27:31.050
I think it's time to go.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.252
Agreed.
Not us. You.

27:33.285 --> 27:34.787
Honey...

27:34.821 --> 27:36.823
you have no idea what it is like

27:36.856 --> 27:38.858
for a single woman of my age
in Westchester.

27:38.891 --> 27:40.059
Everyone is so boring

27:40.092 --> 27:42.261
or married or cancer...

27:42.294 --> 27:44.430
That sounds hard.

27:44.463 --> 27:46.799
And he's practically
throwing himself at me,

27:46.833 --> 27:48.167
don't you think?

27:48.200 --> 27:50.236
He's absolutely
coming on to you.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.237
Okay.

27:51.270 --> 27:52.271
Then go to Calvin

27:52.304 --> 27:53.405
and say I'm good to go.

27:55.074 --> 27:56.709
Are... are you serious?

27:56.743 --> 28:00.012
Becca... I thought you and I
were getting along so well.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.347
Having fun.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.850
You don't want me to have fun
while I'm here?

28:05.952 --> 28:07.153
Okay.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.821
I did not leave you, Greg.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.489
Really?
Because I remember bags packed,

28:10.522 --> 28:12.792
carried down the stairs,
and a car pulling away.

28:12.825 --> 28:14.260
Are those staying activities?

28:14.293 --> 28:15.862
I wanted you to live with me,

28:15.895 --> 28:18.464
but you insisted on
staying in West Covina.

28:18.497 --> 28:19.932
You just wanted me to leave Dad?

28:19.966 --> 28:21.033
After you did?

28:21.067 --> 28:22.869
You're just like your father.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.804
You want things black and white.

28:24.837 --> 28:26.305
You're right.

28:26.338 --> 28:27.840
I made a mistake.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.241
But it wasn't
leaving your father.

28:29.275 --> 28:31.077
We were both unhappy.

28:31.110 --> 28:32.879
My mistake was that

28:32.912 --> 28:34.781
I should have insisted
on shared custody.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.749
I didn't want
to force it.

28:36.783 --> 28:38.317
I didn't want you
to hate me.

28:38.350 --> 28:41.153
Obviously, that didn't work.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.958
Greg, you are always
welcome here.

28:45.992 --> 28:47.894
We all love you.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.297
This is your home, too.

28:52.965 --> 28:55.902
You know, I usually
don't say this to people,

28:55.935 --> 28:59.071
'cause it's a bit too
on the nose for me,

28:59.105 --> 29:01.908
but you need to get
over yourself and grow up.

29:01.941 --> 29:04.877
And now, 'cause I'm hungry.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.345
Wait.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.180
You're the only person here
not involved in this situation,

29:08.214 --> 29:09.816
and you think
I'm the one out of line?

29:09.849 --> 29:12.084
Um, yeah.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.153
Because she's cool
and you're a dick.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.922
Mason!
That was...

29:19.025 --> 29:20.426
...warranted.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.995
Good call, Mason.

29:23.029 --> 29:25.431
I'm sorry.

29:30.202 --> 29:31.871
I'm sorry, Mom.

29:33.239 --> 29:35.507
Thanks, Greg.

29:37.343 --> 29:38.978
Mm-hmm. Okay.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.980
Good-bye.
Hey, Cal.

29:41.013 --> 29:42.949
So I'm gonna
head home.

29:42.982 --> 29:43.883
Have a wonderful holiday,

29:43.916 --> 29:45.918
and I need you to sleep
with my mom. Bye.

29:45.952 --> 29:46.953
Excuse me?

29:52.591 --> 29:54.861
Okay, so... I need you to sleep

29:54.894 --> 29:56.262
with my mom,
just a little bit.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.163
Doesn't have to be all the way.

29:57.196 --> 29:58.497
It could be anything
of your choosing.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.099
Hand stuff, an erotic massage...

30:00.132 --> 30:02.068
(laughing)

30:02.101 --> 30:03.435
Oh.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.470
You're serious.

30:04.503 --> 30:05.537
Come on.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.840
Look, I bet she is a real
spitfire in the sack,

30:07.874 --> 30:09.041
if she's anything like
her daughter.

30:09.075 --> 30:10.276
Right?
You look confused.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.543
Let me lay this
out for you.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.412
There is a ring,

30:13.445 --> 30:15.447
and it's been in my family
for generations,

30:15.481 --> 30:18.584
and I am so close
to getting that ring.

30:18.617 --> 30:20.519
But if you turn down
my mother tonight,

30:20.552 --> 30:22.221
that ring goes bye-bye.

30:22.254 --> 30:23.322
(sighs)

30:26.025 --> 30:27.526
Please?

30:27.559 --> 30:29.261
Please, please, please,
please, please.

30:29.295 --> 30:31.497
Okay. I-I get it.

30:31.530 --> 30:33.432
I'm a mom pleaser myself.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.067
Exactly.
So you understand the burden.

30:35.101 --> 30:36.302
So you'll do it.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.870
No.

30:47.980 --> 30:51.350
So, I spoke to him,

30:51.383 --> 30:55.254
and he really wants to take you
up to his hotel room.

30:55.287 --> 30:56.655
He does?

30:56.688 --> 30:58.457
Yeah.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.159
But I had to tell him no.

31:02.628 --> 31:03.595
What?

31:03.629 --> 31:04.596
It's too close to home.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.532
He's my biggest client,
and I couldn't risk it.

31:06.565 --> 31:07.934
Are-are you kidding?

31:07.967 --> 31:09.201
Why did you do that?

31:09.235 --> 31:10.202
Where is he?

31:10.236 --> 31:11.470
I sent him away.

31:11.503 --> 31:12.571
There were tears.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.240
Are you out of your mind?

31:14.273 --> 31:15.541
Oh, God.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.576
(sighs)

31:17.609 --> 31:20.246
*

31:20.279 --> 31:21.580
(power line crackles)

31:21.613 --> 31:23.615
(footsteps)

31:25.151 --> 31:27.519
(protesting whimper)

31:27.553 --> 31:29.388
Mom, what are
you doing? Wait.

31:31.690 --> 31:33.592
Your flight's not for
another five hours.

31:33.625 --> 31:36.362
Where did you get this crystal
rectal thermometer from again?

31:36.395 --> 31:37.596
Just give me the
gift receipt,

31:37.629 --> 31:39.531
and I'll return it
at home in New York.

31:39.565 --> 31:43.135
I got it from a local
boutique, and I don't think

31:43.169 --> 31:45.437
they take returns,
just exchanges.

31:45.471 --> 31:47.206
Let's just go
to that stupid store

31:47.239 --> 31:49.976
on the way to the airport, okay?

31:50.009 --> 31:52.644
Rise and shine!

31:52.678 --> 31:56.082
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention, Christmas shoppers:
Don't miss the sale...

31:56.115 --> 31:57.583
Hey, guys!
(laughs)
Hi.

31:57.616 --> 32:00.719
Just wanted to say,
best of luck out there.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.454
I thought you had work.

32:02.488 --> 32:03.389
Ah, gave myself
a Christmas gift.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.058
Just had my mom call,
say I had the flu.

32:06.092 --> 32:07.659
(laughter)
Uh,

32:07.693 --> 32:11.563
I hope you guys know that
these are the good old days.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.599
Like, the best of times.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.334
So, enjoy them.

32:15.367 --> 32:16.635
Thanks, man.

32:20.206 --> 32:21.173
Ow!

32:21.207 --> 32:22.708
What's wrong?

32:22.741 --> 32:24.543
Oh. Oh, it's-it's my ankle!

32:24.576 --> 32:26.312
Oh, it-it's bad.

32:26.345 --> 32:27.679
Wait. Are-are you sure?
Yeah.

32:27.713 --> 32:28.714
I don't think I can go on.

32:28.747 --> 32:31.150
What are we gonna do?
Who knows the choreography?

32:31.183 --> 32:33.719
Uh, uh, well, Miguel has
done a pretty good job.

32:33.752 --> 32:35.021
Uh, change
the formation?

32:35.054 --> 32:37.223
Mr. Chan, you know the answer.

32:37.256 --> 32:39.258
It's not Miguel?

32:39.291 --> 32:41.060
It's never too late, bro.

32:41.093 --> 32:43.095
It's never too late.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.599
The only decent thing
was a floor lamp,

32:47.633 --> 32:50.069
so now I'm gonna have
to check a bag.

32:50.102 --> 32:51.570
I'm very sorry, Mom.

32:51.603 --> 32:54.040
Okay, I'll pay the baggage
fee. How about that?

32:55.074 --> 32:57.043
You baffle me, you know that?

32:57.076 --> 32:58.610
Your whole life,
you have.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.179
(sighs heavily)

33:00.212 --> 33:02.448
My dramatic little girl
who never thought

33:02.481 --> 33:04.750
through the consequences
of her decisions.

33:04.783 --> 33:06.485
I've been here
for two days.

33:06.518 --> 33:09.655
I still don't know why
you live in this dump of a town.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.357
I told you, I got
an offer that I...

33:11.390 --> 33:13.525
I know you don't
believe me, Rebecca,

33:13.559 --> 33:15.794
but I want to understand you.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.529
I always have.

33:17.563 --> 33:20.199
Fine. I will tell you
why I moved here. God.

33:22.368 --> 33:23.635
I'll put it out there.

33:23.669 --> 33:26.705
I moved here because...

33:26.738 --> 33:28.807
JOSH (over P.A.):
Josh Chan is in the house!

33:28.840 --> 33:30.742
(applause and cheering)

33:36.515 --> 33:38.150
*

33:42.088 --> 33:43.289
Let's go!

33:43.322 --> 33:46.125
* Everybody, come on,
come on, come on *

33:46.158 --> 33:48.494
* Everybody in the house,
start it up now *

33:48.527 --> 33:51.597
* Everybody, come on,
come on, come on *

33:51.630 --> 33:55.334
* Everybody in the house,
start it up now... *

33:55.367 --> 33:56.635
(cheering)
* Everybody, come on

33:56.668 --> 33:58.504
* Come on, come on...

33:58.537 --> 34:00.172
Moved here for Josh Chan?

34:00.206 --> 34:02.174
(laughs)
Why am I surprised?

34:02.208 --> 34:03.709
You were always so impulsive.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.178
Of course you would do something
like give up your wonderful life

34:06.212 --> 34:08.347
in New York to be near
that... that loser!

34:08.380 --> 34:11.317
I did not do that, okay?

34:11.350 --> 34:12.684
And he is not a loser.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.254
You know what? I'm tired
of this. I'm sorry.

34:15.286 --> 34:18.224
I am tired of trying
to bend over backwards

34:18.257 --> 34:20.559
to please someone who
can never be pleased.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.128
You got a lot of nerve,
you know that?

34:22.161 --> 34:23.295
After all I've done for you.

34:23.329 --> 34:25.197
I came here
to make peace with you.

34:25.231 --> 34:27.266
I was gonna give you
the Garfinkel ring.

34:27.299 --> 34:28.699
You know what? Keep
the Garfinkel ring.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.869
Keep it! I'm a grown woman.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.172
I don't care about the stupid
Garfinkel ring anymore.

34:33.205 --> 34:34.172
And you know what?

34:34.206 --> 34:36.708
You know how you're
getting to the airport?

34:36.742 --> 34:38.409
Uber!
Very nice.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.612
Picking you up in three
minutes. There you go.

34:40.646 --> 34:42.581
* You shake it, shake,
shake it for me. *

34:42.614 --> 34:44.650
*

34:46.885 --> 34:48.554
(song ends)

34:48.587 --> 34:50.556
(applause and cheering)

34:50.589 --> 34:53.359
Yeah!

34:53.391 --> 34:54.426
(whoops)
Nice one, man.

34:54.460 --> 34:55.494
Killed it. Killed it.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.396
Dude, you totally
killed it out there!

34:57.429 --> 34:59.665
You still got it, man!
Hey, I appreciate
that. I do.

34:59.698 --> 35:02.334
But I think I pulled my spine
and may never walk again.

35:02.368 --> 35:03.469
(laughing)

35:03.502 --> 35:07.139
The truth is, uh...

35:07.173 --> 35:09.141
I'm not a kid.

35:09.175 --> 35:11.243
I'm Mr. Chan.

35:11.277 --> 35:12.378
And...

35:12.411 --> 35:14.380
you know what?

35:14.413 --> 35:17.683
I'm realizing, it might be time
for me to grow up.

35:21.287 --> 35:22.721
And while we're
airing things out,

35:22.754 --> 35:24.723
let me tell you a couple
other things, okay?

35:24.756 --> 35:27.593
My friend Paula-- she's
not British or Jewish.

35:27.626 --> 35:30.362
I do work at that loser firm,
and I never wear panty hose,

35:30.396 --> 35:31.763
because they cause
yeast infections.

35:31.797 --> 35:34.700
And because of you, I feel
one coming on right now.

35:34.733 --> 35:35.834
That's disgusting.

35:35.867 --> 35:37.236
You know what?

35:37.269 --> 35:38.670
I know you're
disappointed in me.

35:38.704 --> 35:40.272
I know I'm not

35:40.306 --> 35:42.441
the married work monster
that you want me to be.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.376
But you know what?

35:44.410 --> 35:45.844
Neither are you.

35:45.877 --> 35:49.615
You are a horny,
unemployed divorcée

35:49.648 --> 35:51.617
who married an
Irish Catholic!

35:51.650 --> 35:54.786
I am half him, and that
is why you hate me!

35:54.820 --> 35:56.388
I am half of what you hate!

35:56.422 --> 35:57.656
"Hate you"?

35:57.689 --> 35:58.957
I don't hate you.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.626
What?

36:00.659 --> 36:02.761
Is that what you think, Rebecca,
that I hate you?

36:02.794 --> 36:04.463
I love you.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.332
I've always loved you.

36:06.365 --> 36:07.633
I love you too much.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.835
I wake up every morning
sick with worry,

36:09.868 --> 36:11.470
wondering where you are,
how you are.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.939
I am consumed
by my love for you.

36:13.972 --> 36:16.508
And when you have a child,
you will understand this.

36:16.542 --> 36:19.678
If I ever have a kid, I will
only care if they're happy.

36:19.711 --> 36:20.846
"Happy"?
What's "happy"?

36:20.879 --> 36:22.448
That's a term for stupid people.

36:22.481 --> 36:23.782
I want you to survive.

36:23.815 --> 36:25.251
Our people
are not about happy.

36:25.284 --> 36:27.319
We're about survival.

36:27.353 --> 36:29.521
And that is why I'm glad
that you stood up to me.

36:29.555 --> 36:31.790
Because that means,
when the Cossacks come,

36:31.823 --> 36:33.492
you can fight back.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.261
You can survive.

36:35.294 --> 36:37.363
I love you.

36:37.396 --> 36:38.630
Of course I love you.

36:38.664 --> 36:40.266
I am your mother.

36:40.299 --> 36:42.568
(crying):
Mommy, of course
I love you, too.

36:42.601 --> 36:45.437
Get over here,
you get over here.

36:47.373 --> 36:48.407
It's okay, Becca.

36:48.440 --> 36:49.475
(phone chimes)

36:52.811 --> 36:54.513
Your Uber's here.
You should go.

36:54.546 --> 36:55.714
You should go.
Okay, okay, okay!

36:55.747 --> 36:57.349
I'll go, I'll go.

36:57.383 --> 36:59.418
But you're coming home
for Passover, right?

37:00.486 --> 37:01.720
Becca?
You know what?

37:01.753 --> 37:03.422
No, I'm not coming home
for Pa...

37:05.457 --> 37:07.759
Okay, I'll come home
for Passover.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.761
Good girl.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.465
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

37:13.499 --> 37:16.402
You got it.

37:16.435 --> 37:18.437
Bye.
Bye.

37:19.705 --> 37:21.573
So, I found a gift for my mom.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.509
Is it that you finally
went through puberty?

37:23.542 --> 37:25.277
(laughs)
No.

37:25.311 --> 37:27.446
I got her a candle.

37:27.479 --> 37:29.781
It smells like, um, pine.

37:29.815 --> 37:32.418
That's good.
That's a good first step.

37:32.451 --> 37:35.454
You know, your lack of social
decorum saved the holiday.

37:35.487 --> 37:36.622
It was a Christmas miracle.

37:36.655 --> 37:38.390
I get that a lot.

37:38.424 --> 37:39.791
I had the best time.

37:39.825 --> 37:40.792
Really?

37:40.826 --> 37:42.361
You kind of hated me.

37:42.394 --> 37:43.629
Yeah, in a good way.

37:43.662 --> 37:44.996
I thought it was cute.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.532
In what way?

37:46.565 --> 37:48.634
Cute like a hamster
playing the piano

37:48.667 --> 37:52.304
or cute like a man who's
handsome and not cute?

37:52.338 --> 37:54.506
I don't know.
We'll see.

37:54.540 --> 37:55.774
Oh, bummer.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.443
I have to go
back to work now.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.611
No, I want to keep hanging out.

37:59.645 --> 38:00.712
All right, I'll quit.

38:00.746 --> 38:02.047
What?

38:02.080 --> 38:03.682
I quit!

38:03.715 --> 38:07.553
Hey, can you give these
to the toy kiosk?

38:07.586 --> 38:09.054
(laughs)
Thanks.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.456
Awesome!

38:11.857 --> 38:13.892
Dude, weak.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.469
Hey, Becks!

38:23.502 --> 38:24.870
Haven't seen you all week.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.638
Hi.
How was your holiday?

38:26.672 --> 38:28.774
(laughs)
It was interesting.

38:29.941 --> 38:32.444
I finally now feel
what it's like

38:32.478 --> 38:33.712
to be a grown-up at Christmas.

38:33.745 --> 38:35.581
Dude... me, too!

38:35.614 --> 38:36.782
(gasps)
Emotional jinx!

38:36.815 --> 38:37.983
You owe me a Coke.

38:38.016 --> 38:39.485
(both laugh)

38:39.518 --> 38:41.820
Want to go see Santa?

38:41.853 --> 38:43.655
Yeah.
(chuckles)

38:44.923 --> 38:48.494
* Well, you can take
your snow and shove it *

38:48.527 --> 38:52.364
* This is our Christmas
and we love it *

38:52.398 --> 38:53.965
* It's 100 degrees

38:53.999 --> 38:55.967
* This elf is Vietnamese

38:56.001 --> 38:58.904
* That's the way
that California does it *

38:58.937 --> 39:03.509
* Even our Santa has a suntan

39:03.542 --> 39:06.445
* He's also an unemployed
stunt man *

39:06.478 --> 39:08.814
* Is he even awake?

39:08.847 --> 39:11.016
* Yeah, I'm just really baked

39:11.049 --> 39:14.686
* If he can be Santa Claus,
anyone can *

39:16.722 --> 39:19.991
* California Christmastime

39:20.025 --> 39:23.629
* Is just a Golden State
of mind *

39:23.662 --> 39:28.567
* Chet's nuts roasting
in the bright sunlight *

39:28.600 --> 39:30.936
Put on some pants, Chet!

39:30.969 --> 39:33.639
* And what would Christmas be

39:33.672 --> 39:36.074
* Without historically
low mountain snow *

39:36.107 --> 39:38.544
* Causing staggering drought

39:38.577 --> 39:42.948
* But, hey, this eggnog
froyo's super tight *

39:42.981 --> 39:45.116
* Super tight

39:45.150 --> 39:49.187
* 'Cause this is California

39:49.220 --> 39:52.023
* And we do Christmas right

39:52.057 --> 39:53.559
* California Christmastime *

39:53.592 --> 39:55.594
Mmm, so good.

39:58.597 --> 40:01.199
* Don we now our surf apparel

40:01.232 --> 40:05.637
* And we have our own kind
of Christmas Carol *

40:05.671 --> 40:07.105
* It's this chick named Carol

40:07.138 --> 40:09.040
* She does henna tattoos

40:09.074 --> 40:11.142
* Carol's 50, but no judgment

40:11.176 --> 40:12.678
* She's still finding herself

40:12.711 --> 40:14.713
* We're all finding ourselves

40:14.746 --> 40:18.116
* Okay, there is
no easy answer *

40:18.149 --> 40:22.053
* For our high rates
of skin cancer *

40:22.087 --> 40:23.989
* It took my dad's life

40:24.022 --> 40:26.592
* And it killed my wife

40:26.625 --> 40:29.728
* Hang ten,
Rudolph and Prancer *

40:29.761 --> 40:33.465
* California Christmastime

40:33.499 --> 40:36.935
* We gather round
and sing songs by Sublime *

40:36.968 --> 40:41.907
* And all our local reggae bands
are white *

40:41.940 --> 40:44.676
(reggae beat plays)

40:44.710 --> 40:47.946
* The kids get lots of toys
on Christmas morn *

40:47.979 --> 40:51.617
* 'Cause Daddy makes
big bucks directing porn *

40:51.650 --> 40:53.184
* They may have gonorrhea

40:53.218 --> 40:56.121
* But at least
it's not frostbite *

40:56.154 --> 40:58.990
* It's not frostbite *

40:59.024 --> 41:02.661
* 'Cause this is California

41:02.694 --> 41:05.731
* And we do Christmas right

41:05.764 --> 41:08.567
* California Christmastime *

41:08.600 --> 41:12.771
* California
Christmastime *

41:12.804 --> 41:16.775
* California Christmastime *

41:16.808 --> 41:19.678
* California
Christmastime *

41:19.711 --> 41:23.615
* California Christmastime *

41:23.649 --> 41:27.953
* California
Christmastime *

41:27.986 --> 41:31.256
* California Christmastime

41:31.289 --> 41:33.625
* Calif...

41:33.659 --> 41:36.628
You-you have places to be.
I get it.
