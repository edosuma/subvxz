WEBVTT

00:12.083 --> 00:13.083
- Previously on "Below Deck."

00:12.708 --> 00:13.083
- This is next level.

00:15.542 --> 00:18.708
These flowers for Emily are the
best flowers I've ever seen.

00:18.750 --> 00:21.083
- Ashley's transgender.
- Who's Ashley?

00:22.917 --> 00:25.875
- You're full of surprises,
aren't you?

00:25.875 --> 00:27.500
I'll sort something out
for you, okay?

00:29.083 --> 00:31.333
- Mr. Slover is back.

00:31.375 --> 00:32.958
- Dean has such high standards.

00:34.250 --> 00:35.792
- Can we get some service
out here

00:35.833 --> 00:38.333
on the aft deck please?
- Emily. Emily, Kate.

00:38.375 --> 00:39.875
Can't even leave
for five minutes.

00:39.917 --> 00:41.708
- Sounded a lot like you were
blaming me and Em.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.167
- Your girlfriend--like,

00:43.208 --> 00:45.125
you're distracted
too much or some thing.

00:45.167 --> 00:46.708
- This dish was disappointing
'cause it just didn't have

00:46.750 --> 00:48.208
a lot of flavor.

00:48.250 --> 00:50.917
- Watch the bow please.
Goddamn it! Sh--.

00:50.958 --> 00:53.208
- Why can't we just be
a functional deck crew?

00:53.250 --> 00:54.708
- I expected us
to be further along.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.708
I'm gonna make some
alterations.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.083
- That was, like,
an hour taxi ride.

00:58.083 --> 00:59.417
No, homey don't play that.

00:59.458 --> 01:01.083
- Instead of them
hopping in the taxi,

01:01.125 --> 01:04.042
I'm gonna bring the tender
to the beach.

01:04.083 --> 01:06.250
F---. Nico has the keys
to the "Intrepid."

01:06.250 --> 01:08.083
- So now I have to bail
your ass out.

01:08.083 --> 01:10.250
- My ass is about
to be handed to me.

01:31.958 --> 01:33.208
This f---ing sucks.

01:36.125 --> 01:37.625
- We gonna move?

01:37.667 --> 01:39.583
- All right, Nico,
I just want to take a hot shower

01:39.625 --> 01:40.625
and clean up.

01:40.625 --> 01:41.792
- Dean and all of his friends

01:41.833 --> 01:43.708
are crispy bacon strips
right now,

01:43.750 --> 01:45.792
and I'm wondering
where the hell's Kelley.

01:45.833 --> 01:49.250
- Like, really?
Pisses me off.

01:49.292 --> 01:51.875
- I think there was a question
like this on my SAT.

01:51.917 --> 01:53.542
If Captain Lee's in the rib,

01:53.583 --> 01:56.375
and Kelley's at dock
A with the tender,

01:56.417 --> 02:00.625
but Nico's at island B
with the keys and the guests,

02:00.667 --> 02:02.458
how much trouble
are we all in?

02:02.500 --> 02:04.458
Yachting is supposed
to be perfection.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.542
This is just stupid.

02:10.625 --> 02:12.500
- Sh--. Oh, sh--.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.667
I have the tender keys.

02:18.042 --> 02:19.417
- Why? Why, Kelley?

02:19.458 --> 02:21.833
Why did you not grab the keys?
F---.

02:24.042 --> 02:26.250
- Are they back yet?
- Um, the captain has gone

02:26.292 --> 02:28.625
to get them
in the inflatable tender...

02:28.667 --> 02:30.500
- Oh, wow.
- So...

02:30.500 --> 02:32.083
I'm making some stiff drinks.

02:32.125 --> 02:34.167
- F---.

02:34.167 --> 02:36.750
This is f---ed up.
It's affecting me.

02:36.792 --> 02:38.500
It's affecting everyone.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.250
- There they are.
- Attention, "Valor" crew,

02:40.292 --> 02:41.917
headed back with the guests.

02:41.958 --> 02:43.458
I need everybody to get
in position accordingly.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.333
- Oh, I see them.

02:45.375 --> 02:47.333
- They're coming back?
- Yeah, let's open alcohol.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.500
- Alcohol.
- Alcohol.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.500
Ben?
- Yes?

02:50.542 --> 02:51.833
- You got to see this.

02:51.875 --> 02:53.292
- Well, I'm not worried
about that.

02:53.333 --> 02:54.375
I'm worried
about putting out lunch.

02:54.417 --> 02:56.292
- Hello.

02:56.333 --> 02:58.625
- We'll get this thing tied up,
and you guys can get some lunch

02:58.667 --> 02:59.708
'cause I know
you're probably famished.

02:59.708 --> 03:01.167
- Thank you very much.

03:01.208 --> 03:02.958
- Sorry for
the inconvenience, gentlemen.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.042
- I'm just so hungry.
- Hi. Champagne?

03:14.208 --> 03:15.375
- How the f--- you get here?

03:15.375 --> 03:16.792
- Taxi.
- Come on, come on.

03:16.833 --> 03:20.792
Come on. Captain Lee was
supposed to get you.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.250
- Captain Lee.
Captain Lee, Kelley.

03:24.708 --> 03:26.542
- He's on a rib inbound to me?

03:26.583 --> 03:31.208
Nico just came out of nowhere
with the keys to the "Intrepid."

03:31.208 --> 03:33.125
- Uh, I'm gonna get a reaming.
You're not.

03:33.167 --> 03:35.167
That was my f--- up.

03:35.208 --> 03:37.417
F---.

03:37.458 --> 03:39.500
That's the captain.

03:39.542 --> 03:40.875
- Yeah, f---.

03:46.625 --> 03:48.917
- Hey, Cap, I'm sorry.

03:48.958 --> 03:50.875
Nico found the keys.

03:50.917 --> 03:53.542
- The keys weren't lost.
You can drive this back.

03:53.583 --> 03:55.542
I'll take that.
I'm tired of getting beat up.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.583
- Roger that.

03:57.625 --> 03:59.417
- He should've not called
the captain.

03:59.417 --> 04:02.500
He should've taken a taxi back
and picked up the keys.

04:06.958 --> 04:08.375
- Lots of photos?

04:08.417 --> 04:10.083
- I sure they have lots
of photos, yes.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.500
- Yeah?
Did you have a nice time?

04:15.458 --> 04:18.708
- Dean is pissed,
so thanks, deck crew.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.042
You're making my life harder.

04:20.083 --> 04:21.625
- Hey.

04:21.625 --> 04:24.125
- So I don't care if
the boat is sinking.

04:24.125 --> 04:27.208
We always want to just keep
Dean's wine glass full.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.792
- Okay.
- But also, Ben,

04:29.833 --> 04:31.750
I think we have now five guests

04:31.792 --> 04:33.292
at the table including Dean,

04:33.292 --> 04:36.542
so if you want
to start platter-ing.

04:36.583 --> 04:38.500
- Not a happy cappy.

04:42.458 --> 04:44.625
- You guys win, huh?

04:44.667 --> 04:48.792
- Thanks for the rescue.
- No problem.

04:48.833 --> 04:50.167
You enjoyed it, though?

04:52.958 --> 04:55.208
I started freaking out.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.542
- Today's the day I die.
- Yeah.

05:03.208 --> 05:05.792
- Here we go, baby.
Thank you.

05:05.833 --> 05:08.458
Man, I'm gonna be so glad
to get all this over with.

05:11.333 --> 05:14.667
- Today we're starting with a
watermelon feta and mint salad.

05:14.667 --> 05:17.750
This is blackened mahi
with a mango-lime salsa.

05:17.792 --> 05:19.167
- Stone crab claw?

05:19.167 --> 05:21.000
- Now we're talking.
- Really good.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.333
- So good.
- It's perfect. I love it.

05:24.333 --> 05:26.292
- The best way to get
the guests happy again

05:26.333 --> 05:27.917
is get some drinks, food.

05:27.958 --> 05:29.250
Oldest trick in the book.

05:35.875 --> 05:37.125
- This could fall.

05:37.167 --> 05:39.083
Okay, what do I do
with this now?

05:39.125 --> 05:42.208
- Um, put them in that
cardboard box by the ice maker.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.125
Ben needs to focus
on his cooking

05:44.167 --> 05:46.208
and not the f---ing flowers.

05:46.208 --> 05:47.542
- Just don't want to lose these.

05:53.208 --> 05:55.333
- I am really not happy

05:55.375 --> 05:57.125
at all with what happened,

05:57.167 --> 05:59.833
but I'll be very clear
that it won't happen again.

05:59.875 --> 06:01.708
- You got a boom down on it?

06:01.750 --> 06:04.167
- Kelley and Nico up
to the wheelhouse.

06:04.208 --> 06:06.625
- The f--- up at the bass
is the last thing I need,

06:06.667 --> 06:09.625
and now I've got to go deal
with the consequences.

06:17.542 --> 06:20.125
- A million things went wrong
which all culminated

06:20.167 --> 06:21.875
in where we're at right now.

06:21.875 --> 06:25.000
What I'd like to do is rip
your f---ing head off.

06:28.375 --> 06:29.917
- It was a big f--- up.
I know.

06:29.917 --> 06:31.708
- I don't want to talk
about it now

06:31.750 --> 06:34.417
because I don't want to say
something I might regret.

06:34.417 --> 06:36.458
You're spread just
a little too thin.

06:38.708 --> 06:41.917
And I'm afraid what I'm gonna
have to do is give Nico

06:41.917 --> 06:44.000
a little more responsibility.

06:45.917 --> 06:49.708
Nico, I'm gonna make you senior
deckhand effective immediately.

06:52.083 --> 06:54.417
It'll give you
some welcome relief,

06:54.458 --> 06:57.417
not having to worry about being
everywhere all at one time.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.750
I think maybe clear your head
just a little bit.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.500
So you're gonna have
some authority...

07:02.542 --> 07:05.750
- Okay.
- And more responsibility.

07:05.792 --> 07:07.292
I hope you deal with it well.

07:07.292 --> 07:09.250
- Absolutely.
- I think Nico's fairly bright,

07:09.292 --> 07:10.792
and I think he's a hard worker.

07:10.792 --> 07:12.458
Sometimes when you
give somebody

07:12.458 --> 07:14.792
more responsibility,
they answer the call.

07:14.833 --> 07:16.708
I want this last day
and a half here

07:16.750 --> 07:17.958
to go flawlessly.

07:17.958 --> 07:20.458
Really, really need
that to happen.

07:20.458 --> 07:22.875
- Holy s---.

07:22.917 --> 07:24.625
I love the responsibility.

07:24.625 --> 07:26.458
I've put my time in,
and I'm confident in saying

07:26.458 --> 07:28.208
that I do know what I'm doing.

07:28.250 --> 07:29.792
- Any questions?

07:29.792 --> 07:31.292
If so, I don't want
to hear them.

07:31.292 --> 07:32.792
- Roger that.
- Get the f--- out of here.

07:34.792 --> 07:36.125
- How's lunch so far,
all right?

07:36.125 --> 07:37.625
- Very good...
- Good.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.375
- In light of our tardiness.
- Oh, good, yeah.

07:40.417 --> 07:42.625
- It's always an issue.
But no, it's perfect.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.250
- Bonjour.
- Talk to me. What happened?

07:51.292 --> 07:52.667
- You mean with Cap?
- Mm-hmm.

07:52.708 --> 07:54.167
- Kind of gave me
a little promotion.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.000
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.458
- Dude, congratulations.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:58.500 --> 08:01.000
I feel like I busted my ass
the whole season for it,

08:01.000 --> 08:02.917
and this is what I've been
waiting for.

08:02.958 --> 08:05.917
He was like, "You're now gonna
be running things with Kelley.

08:05.958 --> 08:08.292
You guys will be in charge
of the deck team."

08:08.333 --> 08:09.750
- I'm so excited for you.

08:09.792 --> 08:11.500
Well done.

08:11.542 --> 08:12.500
Ah!

08:13.500 --> 08:15.000
We have to celebrate.

08:17.208 --> 08:19.000
- I'm in the best mood
of moods today.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.833
Guess who's flying out
to the island right now.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.250
- Ashley?

08:22.292 --> 08:23.833
- She could be on
the island already.

08:23.875 --> 08:26.000
- Shoot, man, that's
f---ing awesome, happy for you.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.292
I'm sorry, I just got the sh--
kicked out of me, basically.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.042
- By the Captain?
What did he say?

08:30.083 --> 08:32.167
- Nothing, Nico's just gonna
help me out a little more.

08:32.208 --> 08:35.208
- Like a second boatswain?
- No, like a senior deckhand

08:35.250 --> 08:37.375
like Trevor was.
I'm fine with it.

08:37.375 --> 08:39.042
When I'm off board,
he's in charge.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.042
But the thing is,
it was an honest mistake,

08:41.042 --> 08:43.042
and like, if he's gonna freak
the f--- out about it,

08:43.083 --> 08:45.042
he's gonna freak
the f--- out about it.

08:45.042 --> 08:47.125
There's not much I can do.

08:50.917 --> 08:51.958
- Know what I mean?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.625
- Whoo-hoo!

09:11.417 --> 09:12.750
- Hey.

09:12.792 --> 09:14.417
- How are you?
- Very well, how are you, sir?

09:14.458 --> 09:16.250
- You know what?
Let's skip charcuterie today

09:16.250 --> 09:17.250
since lunch was so late.

09:17.292 --> 09:18.750
- Absolutely.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.083
- Otherwise, we're just
eating all day.

09:20.083 --> 09:21.750
- Okay.
- So we'll just skip charcuterie

09:21.750 --> 09:23.583
and just pick up with dinner
at 8:30, all right?

09:23.583 --> 09:25.500
- I'm fine with that.
- You wouldn't be offended

09:25.542 --> 09:27.750
if I threw in maybe
another course or two tonight?

09:27.750 --> 09:29.333
- No, that'd be fine.
- Okay. Absolutely.

09:29.375 --> 09:32.250
I want to kind of make it up
to you a little bit.

09:32.250 --> 09:33.917
I'm gonna just throw
the book at him,

09:33.917 --> 09:35.417
and he's gonna love it

09:35.458 --> 09:37.417
because there won't be
any mistakes tonight.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.500
- Coming up.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.083
- Nico just got promoted
to boatswain.

09:46.083 --> 09:47.417
- Oh, dear.
- You want to undermine me?

09:47.458 --> 09:48.583
You want to f--- with my job?

09:48.583 --> 09:49.917
We're gonna have big issues.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.417
So you need to watch
what you f---ing say.

09:54.333 --> 09:54.583
- Whoo-hoo!

09:56.292 --> 09:57.292
- Can I offer you
a cocktail of the day?

09:57.292 --> 09:58.417
Ginger and lychee martini.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.125
- I kind of feel like
Dean expects

10:03.125 --> 10:04.875
decorative blanket folds from me

10:04.917 --> 10:06.792
'cause it's kind of
how our friendship started.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.208
- It looks like a rocket ship.
It's amazing.

10:10.250 --> 10:12.042
- I guess I could see that.

10:12.083 --> 10:15.125
Yesterday, I thought at least
Dean would acknowledge the fact

10:15.167 --> 10:18.125
that I put a big "V" on his bed,
you know, for "Valor,"

10:18.167 --> 10:19.792
but he says nothing.

10:19.792 --> 10:21.125
I'm gonna have to step it up.

10:21.167 --> 10:24.125
Double the "V,"
double the pleasure.

10:24.167 --> 10:25.958
Perfect.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.292
- So Nico just got promoted
to boatswain, did you hear that?

10:28.292 --> 10:29.708
- What?
- Yeah.

10:29.750 --> 10:32.417
Captain just promoted him.
- Hello.

10:32.458 --> 10:34.250
- Nico just got
promoted to boatswain.

10:34.292 --> 10:37.083
- Oh, dear.
- Nico, give him a year or two,

10:37.125 --> 10:38.292
will make a good boatswain.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.750
I think he's got
a little growing

10:39.792 --> 10:41.167
to do on the drinking side.

10:41.167 --> 10:43.000
- So Nico's been
promoted to boatswain.

10:43.042 --> 10:44.625
- Wait, wait, wait.
Come here.

10:44.667 --> 10:46.292
Is it because of
the f--- up today?

10:46.333 --> 10:48.333
- I think so, yeah.
- Well, that's gonna cause

10:48.333 --> 10:50.125
a bit of rivalry, isn't it?

10:50.167 --> 10:54.167
- Senior deckhand Nico.

10:54.167 --> 10:56.583
- Have you heard about
the new promotion?

10:56.625 --> 10:59.167
- Yeah, we got a new
boatswain onboard.

10:59.208 --> 11:00.292
Wonder what he looks like.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.375
- Hm.

11:05.667 --> 11:07.667
Where did I put...

11:22.667 --> 11:25.208
- Oh, come on.
You can do this.

11:25.250 --> 11:28.042
- What you looking for?
- Walnuts, have you seen them?

11:28.083 --> 11:29.708
- Yeah, they're down
in the crew mess.

11:29.708 --> 11:31.875
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I saw the pack today.

11:31.875 --> 11:33.708
- Bloody hell.
You're a genius.

11:33.708 --> 11:37.042
- Will you do me a favor and go
freshen up Dean's cabin?

11:37.042 --> 11:38.542
You talked to Dean,
right, Ben?

11:38.583 --> 11:41.042
- I did.
- Dinner's still at 8:30, huh?

11:41.042 --> 11:44.375
- Yes, I'm doing a tasting menu.
- Oh, you are?

11:44.417 --> 11:47.875
- Like, a few courses, yeah.
- If Ben hadn't messed up

11:47.875 --> 11:50.875
the night before,
he wouldn't be doing this.

11:50.917 --> 11:53.667
- I put the ice in to stop
the shrimp from cooking,

11:53.708 --> 11:55.208
and the ice diluted it.

11:55.250 --> 11:56.750
- I don't feel bad
for Ben at all.

11:56.792 --> 12:00.417
What are you making?
- I have--a few things.

12:00.417 --> 12:02.542
Just trying to get a carrot cake
in the oven right now.

12:02.583 --> 12:03.708
- Okay.

12:04.917 --> 12:06.250
- This table looks like s---.

12:08.792 --> 12:12.417
I wanted to come back,
do a good job.

12:12.417 --> 12:14.833
- Yeah, I know, but...

12:14.875 --> 12:16.417
- Yeah.

12:16.417 --> 12:18.583
I may not always agree
with how he runs things,

12:18.583 --> 12:19.917
but I always want
to leave feeling

12:19.917 --> 12:21.083
I did a good job, you know?

12:21.125 --> 12:22.583
- Yeah.

12:22.625 --> 12:23.833
- Emily, Emily, Kate.

12:23.875 --> 12:25.417
- Go ahead, Kate.

12:25.417 --> 12:27.667
- If you could ask Ben
what's for dinner

12:27.708 --> 12:28.958
so we can get cutlery.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.000
- I very much feel like,
up to now, Kate

12:33.042 --> 12:35.083
and I have had
a fantastic work relationship,

12:35.083 --> 12:36.667
but over the last few days...

12:38.292 --> 12:39.458
Right away.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.125
- Thank you.
- Here we go.

12:43.792 --> 12:45.625
Emily, how's it going?

12:45.667 --> 12:50.458
Good. What's for dinner?

12:50.500 --> 12:52.250
All right, uh,
what am I doing?

12:52.292 --> 12:54.458
We got snail
with onion brûlée,

12:54.458 --> 12:57.917
lobster with crispy ham
and beurre blanc.

12:57.958 --> 12:59.792
I love your writing.

13:01.458 --> 13:03.292
- Oh, you must be
in a nice mood, then.

13:05.625 --> 13:07.292
- Six courses?

13:07.333 --> 13:09.208
You're really knocking
it out of the park.

13:15.667 --> 13:17.625
- Knock, knock.
- Come on in.

13:17.625 --> 13:21.000
- Hey, Dean, I just wanted
to apologize for today.

13:21.042 --> 13:23.667
Being stuck on the beach
was my fault.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.333
- You know, we were there
a long time.

13:25.333 --> 13:27.500
Something I'm not used to,
just being stuck out there.

13:27.542 --> 13:29.167
But I'm not big on
"I'm sorry."

13:29.208 --> 13:32.000
What I think would be fun--
I think you and Nico

13:32.042 --> 13:35.167
should do a little
singing apology.

13:35.208 --> 13:37.917
- Normally this would seem
like a very weird request,

13:37.958 --> 13:39.917
but it's Dean
we're talking about.

13:39.958 --> 13:42.167
- First night, it's gonna be
like a black tie formal night.

13:42.167 --> 13:45.333
- I love your Versace underwear.
- Oh, my goodness.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.833
- I do want to see a dive-off
between the staff.

13:47.833 --> 13:50.333
- Whoo!

13:50.333 --> 13:51.667
- We want to feel
the emotion here,

13:51.708 --> 13:53.333
so a little song at dinner,

13:53.333 --> 13:54.833
I would really accept
that apology.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.333
- Roger that.
- All right.

13:56.375 --> 13:58.125
- We'll make it happen.
- I look forward to it.

13:58.167 --> 14:00.208
- Thanks.

14:00.208 --> 14:01.333
- Cheers.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.208
- Last charter.

14:09.375 --> 14:12.625
- Okay, girls, if you guys will
go start the master together,

14:12.667 --> 14:14.708
and then I'll call you
when we're ready to serve.

14:14.750 --> 14:16.375
- Okay.
- You're like, "what are you--"

14:16.417 --> 14:19.333
- No, I get it, I get--
I wish I was doing it with you,

14:19.375 --> 14:21.375
but we've got these people
out there who are called,

14:21.417 --> 14:24.042
like, guests,
and they, like, want stuff.

14:24.042 --> 14:25.375
I feel like Emily and Sierra

14:25.417 --> 14:27.792
are either taking advantage
of my leniency,

14:27.833 --> 14:32.208
or they are being
slackadaisical.

14:32.208 --> 14:33.333
Is that a word?

14:36.333 --> 14:39.042
He wants me and you
to sing him a "sorry" song.

14:39.042 --> 14:40.708
We're gonna go out shirtless
with, like,

14:40.708 --> 14:42.833
"I'm sorry"
or something written on us.

14:43.792 --> 14:45.417
- Yeah.

14:45.417 --> 14:47.417
- Always got to be
taking shirts off around here.

14:47.458 --> 14:48.917
I don't want to do this.

14:48.917 --> 14:51.250
I've done nothing wrong
in this situation.

14:51.292 --> 14:53.417
Ugh. F---.

14:59.917 --> 15:00.875
- Do you like my earring?

15:00.917 --> 15:01.875
Teardrop.

15:03.208 --> 15:04.917
- Ben, we have everyone
at the table.

15:04.917 --> 15:07.167
- Okay, thank you.

15:07.208 --> 15:08.750
There was a f--- up
last night.

15:08.792 --> 15:11.208
I just want you to be prepared
for me being a dick.

15:11.250 --> 15:14.250
What we're gonna do is rotate
the plates calmly and quietly

15:14.250 --> 15:15.583
because I don't want
any mistakes.

15:15.625 --> 15:17.083
- Got you.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.417
- Don't put a thumb print
on there.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.083
Girls, we're up with the snails.
- Okay.

15:22.417 --> 15:24.125
- We have a lot
of courses this evening.

15:24.167 --> 15:25.625
- Oh.
- The first course is going

15:25.667 --> 15:29.292
to be snails
with an onion brûlée cream.

15:29.292 --> 15:31.292
- All right, let's get
the next plate out.

15:31.292 --> 15:32.958
Uh, blackcurrant jelly.

15:34.458 --> 15:36.542
Okay, can we get some service
in here, please?

15:38.458 --> 15:41.458
- This is a foie gras
with a blackcurrant jelly.

15:41.458 --> 15:42.458
- Oh, wow.

15:42.458 --> 15:43.958
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.792
- Bon appétit, you guys.
- Mm. That is really good.

15:47.792 --> 15:50.292

is what he should be doing every
night we have guests onboard,

16:51.375 --> 16:52.833
so I'm really not
that impressed.

16:52.875 --> 16:55.208
- How is he?
- So happy.

16:55.208 --> 16:56.375
- Nico, come up
to the sky lounge.

16:56.417 --> 16:57.792

17:08.042 --> 17:10.042
- Wow.
- Thank you.

17:12.417 --> 17:15.167
- What was our favorite dish?
- Wow, foie gras was incredible.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.042
- I think it was how it was
cooked was so good, yeah.

17:17.083 --> 17:18.667

- Yeah.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.375
No, no, they're really happy.

17:20.375 --> 17:22.208

a real high pressure one.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.542
Are you happy?

17:23.542 --> 17:25.333
- I'm really happy.
- Okay, good.

17:25.375 --> 17:27.042
You've given me
a lot of confidence

17:27.042 --> 17:30.083

- You gonna put the big D on it?
- Yep.

17:45.583 --> 17:47.250
- Is this gonna come off?
- Yeah.

17:47.250 --> 17:49.583
It's latex.
It just might hurt a little bit.

17:49.583 --> 17:51.417

17:51.417 --> 17:53.083

these flowers, babe?

17:53.083 --> 17:54.917

a bit better?

give you friendly advice?

I don't really care.

20:02.083 --> 20:03.125
- All right.

20:06.375 --> 20:08.625
- Hey, Kelley.
- What's up?

20:08.667 --> 20:10.458
- Lauren told me Nico

20:10.500 --> 20:13.000
had been elevated to boatswain.

20:15.208 --> 20:16.917
- No, he's, like,
senior deckhand.

20:16.917 --> 20:18.417
- Oh.

20:18.458 --> 20:20.667
It just strikes me as a bit odd
that she would say that.

20:22.292 --> 20:23.750
I'm not surprised;
When Lauren talks so much,

20:23.750 --> 20:25.250
it becomes a problem.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.667
- It was just such
an uncomfortable situation.

20:26.708 --> 20:28.042
God, Kelley's being
such a prick.

20:28.083 --> 20:29.500
If that was me,
I would've been like--

20:29.542 --> 20:30.583
The way he sort of
delivers information

20:30.625 --> 20:33.417
and gets really,
like, flustered.

20:33.458 --> 20:36.083
- Hey, well, don't get her
in trouble on account of me.

20:36.083 --> 20:38.333
- I really don't give a s---.
I have the two stripes.

20:38.375 --> 20:40.000
They don't.
- All right.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.208
- Is that bleu cheese
or is it just really old?

20:52.250 --> 20:54.708
I'm not sure.
It's both.

20:55.917 --> 20:57.708
- This is a Roquefort.

21:03.250 --> 21:04.750
- Oh.

21:04.792 --> 21:06.708
I'm just trying to go in
to get some cheese,

21:06.750 --> 21:08.292
and I'm getting poked
in the eyeball

21:08.292 --> 21:09.917
by these branches.

21:09.958 --> 21:13.292
This is an active
working zone, the fridge.

21:13.333 --> 21:17.292
This is not a personal
floral storage room.

21:18.792 --> 21:20.667
- So I've been surprised.
- What?

21:22.833 --> 21:24.750
- That's crazy.
Are you excited?

21:24.792 --> 21:26.625
- Yeah.

21:26.667 --> 21:28.125
- Did you talk to Cap?
- No, not yet.

21:28.167 --> 21:29.958
- I don't really know
what to expect.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.042
It's probably the first
transgender person I've met.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.958
I'm really excited to see
what she's gonna be like

21:34.958 --> 21:35.958
and how everyone's gonna react.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.667
I'm so excited to meet her.

21:42.375 --> 21:43.917
- I don't know 'cause
it wasn't a date.

21:43.958 --> 21:45.333
But you knew, like,
the situation

21:45.375 --> 21:46.417
when you were here,
didn't you?

21:50.208 --> 21:51.833
- Yeah.
- I love Ashley.

21:51.833 --> 21:53.167
Love of my life, really.

21:53.208 --> 21:55.333
So knowing I took out Sierra,

21:55.375 --> 21:58.250
I don't think she'd react
too well to that.

21:58.292 --> 21:59.542
F---.

22:06.833 --> 22:09.583
- I think we'll start
with the base.

22:09.625 --> 22:12.333
- So we have French toast here.
- Thank you.

22:12.375 --> 22:14.125
- My pleasure.
- Oh, not too shabby.

22:20.708 --> 22:23.542
- Dean really likes
themed blanket folds,

22:23.583 --> 22:26.375
but my inspiration
is not coming to me.

22:26.375 --> 22:29.208
The first day I had
the "V" for "Valor."

22:29.208 --> 22:30.708
He didn't really say
anything about it.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.542
You know, his name starts
with "D,"

22:32.583 --> 22:35.042
so maybe I should just put
a big "D" on his bed.

22:35.042 --> 22:36.875
- Yeah.
- Just a big old "D."

22:36.875 --> 22:38.208
- Roll it.
- Right on his bed.

22:38.250 --> 22:40.208
- Make it curved.
- Yeah?

22:40.208 --> 22:41.292
- Yeah.
- Dean doesn't seem

22:41.333 --> 22:42.708
to like any of the "Vs."

22:42.708 --> 22:44.292
I just want him to be happy,

22:44.333 --> 22:47.042
and I think
I know what I need to do now.

22:47.083 --> 22:49.542
It has to be the biggest
"D" he's ever seen.

22:51.042 --> 22:52.708
- Do you want
a special breakfast?

22:52.750 --> 22:55.333
- Yeah?
- F--- yeah.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.542
- Could I have a poached egg?
- Of course I'll make you one.

22:57.542 --> 23:00.458
- Is that okay? Are you sure?
- Babe, it's pretty easy.

23:00.500 --> 23:01.625
- How does Nico feel

23:01.667 --> 23:03.250
about his whole promotion thing?

23:03.292 --> 23:06.083
- Apparently that wasn't true.

23:06.125 --> 23:10.750
Apparently, he was promoted
to lead deckhand.

23:10.792 --> 23:12.417
- Is this coming from Nico?

23:12.417 --> 23:14.333
- It's coming
from the horse's mouth.

23:14.375 --> 23:17.083
It's coming from everyone
but Lauren.

23:17.125 --> 23:19.042
Kelley's still the boatswain.

23:19.083 --> 23:20.875
There he is.
- What?

23:20.917 --> 23:22.708
- We were just talking
s--- about you.

23:22.750 --> 23:24.250
- Oh, good.
- No, I'm just kidding.

23:24.292 --> 23:26.000
- That would top off
my charter.

23:26.042 --> 23:29.083
- No, clarify with Ems
that you're the boatswain.

23:29.083 --> 23:32.000
- The Nico situation.
- Oh, yeah.

23:32.042 --> 23:34.917
No, basically he's--Nico's,
like, my senior deckhand now.

23:34.958 --> 23:37.250
- Okay.
- Lauren is awesome,

23:37.250 --> 23:38.833
and she works hard,

23:38.875 --> 23:41.750
but she needs to stop
running her f---ing mouth.

23:41.792 --> 23:43.708
- What's up?
- You need to be careful

23:43.750 --> 23:45.708
what you're saying,
'cause going around the boat

23:45.750 --> 23:48.792
is Nico's second boatswain,

23:48.833 --> 23:50.958
'cause that's not what he is.
He is a senior deckhand.

23:50.958 --> 23:52.625
My word still f---ing rules,

23:52.625 --> 23:54.125
so you need to watch
what you f---ing say.

23:54.125 --> 23:56.958
- Sorry.
- Grab vinegar and water.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.958
Windows.
- Copy.

24:03.292 --> 24:05.792
- Come in.
- El Capitano.

24:05.833 --> 24:07.583
- What can I do for you?

24:07.625 --> 24:09.125
- So a friend from back home

24:09.167 --> 24:11.458
has flown from England
to surprise me.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.958
If I smash my work
out today,

24:13.958 --> 24:16.083
is there any chance
I can knock off early?

24:19.292 --> 24:21.958
- Okay. Fair enough,
but no over-nighters.

24:21.958 --> 24:23.792
We got charter guests
coming on tomorrow.

24:23.833 --> 24:25.917
- All right.
I'm gonna rock and roll.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.667
See you later, Captain.

24:27.667 --> 24:30.333
- Yeah, you've got a lot to do
before you get done.

24:30.375 --> 24:31.583
- Okay. Cheers, Cap.

24:34.708 --> 24:40.417
- Ugh, Kelley's not happy about
the, like, promotion thing.

24:40.458 --> 24:41.833
I'm sorry.

24:41.875 --> 24:44.667
- Everybody's so f---ing
sensitive around here.

24:44.708 --> 24:47.000
- It doesn't mean anything.
None of us care about ranking.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.083
It's just Kelley,
so don't worry too much.

24:50.125 --> 24:52.625
I'll see you outside.

24:52.667 --> 24:56.167
- Emily, see this yellow stain?
Do you know what that's from?

24:56.167 --> 24:57.500
- It's from the flowers.
- It's from the lilies.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.000
- All of the pollens.
- Yeah.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.500
- My ones.
- Well, they're not yours

25:00.500 --> 25:02.000
anymore
'cause you gave them to her,

25:02.000 --> 25:03.333
but you act like they're yours.

25:03.375 --> 25:04.917
I took them
out of the walk-in.

25:04.958 --> 25:07.333
The branch stabbed me
in the eye.

25:07.375 --> 25:08.958
- The next minute they're gonna,
what,

25:09.000 --> 25:10.375
try and break your leg, or...

25:10.417 --> 25:12.375
- I'm trying to
serve the guests

25:12.417 --> 25:14.375
because we're on charter,

25:14.375 --> 25:16.333
but they are magnificent,
those flowers.

25:19.208 --> 25:21.583
- All right, guys, let's pull
it up and get out of here.

25:27.542 --> 25:29.042
- Anchor's home and secure, Cap.

25:31.542 --> 25:34.208
- Breakfast was great.
- So good.

25:34.208 --> 25:35.708
It's ironic
that we left the sausage.

25:44.542 --> 25:45.875
- Kate's been at it again.

25:50.625 --> 25:54.083
- Can you grab
the fridge door, please?

25:54.125 --> 25:55.750
If she wants to clean
this refrigerator,

25:55.750 --> 25:57.917
then she's welcome
to have a say about it.

25:57.917 --> 25:59.917
- I don't think he's ready
to let go of those flowers.

25:59.917 --> 26:02.250
He gave them to you,
but he, like, wants to--

26:02.292 --> 26:04.417
- I want Emily to enjoy them

26:04.417 --> 26:06.833
without guests
on the boat, babe, okay?

26:06.875 --> 26:09.750
So I'm trying to
preserve them.

26:09.750 --> 26:11.708
- So we're gonna just keep them
in the walk-in

26:11.750 --> 26:14.583
for the next 24 hours.

26:14.583 --> 26:16.583
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:16.583 --> 26:18.542
- Honestly, she's got it in
for those flowers.

26:18.583 --> 26:20.083
I promise you, all right?

26:20.125 --> 26:23.583
Let's just ignore
the craziness.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.583
- I feel like I'm very much
caught in the middle

26:25.583 --> 26:28.250
of this situation in the galley
with both of them.

26:28.292 --> 26:30.583
- I mean, I'm just trying
to savor them a little bit.

26:30.625 --> 26:33.292
- Okay.

26:33.292 --> 26:34.750
- Coming up...

26:34.792 --> 26:36.292
- You might want to go look
down the dock.

26:36.292 --> 26:37.292
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:37.333 --> 26:41.250
Pretty sure I just saw her.

26:42.458 --> 26:43.750
- Oh, it is.

26:50.292 --> 26:52.292
- Deck crew, everybody
in position?

26:52.333 --> 26:54.042
- Everyone's in position, Cap.
- Hey, Jake,

26:54.083 --> 26:55.458
can you guys
squeeze in a little more?

26:55.500 --> 26:59.792
Good, good.
Beautiful.

26:59.792 --> 27:03.292
- Oh, that's nice.
Thanks, guys.

27:03.292 --> 27:05.375
- Cap, you got 60 feet
to the catamaran.

27:07.958 --> 27:09.583
- We'll put this one on that,

27:09.625 --> 27:12.042
and then I'll take
that spring second.

27:12.083 --> 27:14.417
That bowline's just
a little bit too tight, Kel.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.625
If we can maybe just
slack it off about another foot.

27:16.667 --> 27:18.833
- Nico's doing really well.
I like his work.

27:18.833 --> 27:21.000
I like his work ethic.
I like his attitude.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.500
Take up on that bowline, Kelley.

27:22.542 --> 27:24.333
- Roger that.
Give me just a sec.

27:24.333 --> 27:26.625
- Lock that in right there if
you can pull as hard as you can.

27:26.667 --> 27:28.500
- I like it.
- Yeah.

27:30.667 --> 27:32.167
- I apologize on behalf
of the flowers.

27:32.208 --> 27:34.000
- No, it's nothing about you.

27:34.042 --> 27:37.000
Those are, like, his prize.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.792
It's crazy.

27:38.833 --> 27:41.667
- Attention, all crew, I need
you on the aft deck in ten.

27:49.500 --> 27:53.250
Let's go.

27:53.292 --> 27:54.750
- Thank you.
It's been a pleasure.

27:54.792 --> 27:59.375
- Thank you.
- Thank you, man.

27:59.375 --> 28:00.542
- Pleasure.
- Thank you.

28:00.583 --> 28:02.625
- Good to see you.
- You as well.

28:02.667 --> 28:04.208
- Dean.
- Captain Lee, how are you?

28:04.250 --> 28:06.042
- Always a pleasure.
- You know, this trip, we had

28:06.083 --> 28:08.125
a couple of ups
and downs I have to say,

28:08.167 --> 28:11.875
with Nico and Kelley
stranding me out there.

28:14.583 --> 28:19.292
And, Ben, there was a stumble
with the one dish...

28:19.333 --> 28:22.375
but the rest of the meals
were spot-on, and you know,

28:22.375 --> 28:24.708
they recovered with their
little routine the other night,

28:24.708 --> 28:26.042
so that was a lot of fun,

28:26.042 --> 28:27.542
and I know we put you
through the wringer

28:27.583 --> 28:29.208
using every single thing
on the boat,

28:29.208 --> 28:30.708
but we had a really good time.

28:30.708 --> 28:31.875
You guys deserve this.

28:31.917 --> 28:33.542
Always a pleasure.
Thank you.

28:33.542 --> 28:35.042
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

28:35.042 --> 28:36.083
- Safe travels.

28:37.250 --> 28:39.417
- Let's go to work.

28:39.458 --> 28:43.708
- Do you feel like this was
Dean's best charter?

28:43.750 --> 28:45.250
- We did an amazing job.

28:45.250 --> 28:47.000
However, there were
a few hiccups.

28:49.083 --> 28:51.917
- "Y'all are terrible.
Y'all don't deserve this tip."

28:51.917 --> 28:53.167
- Heard it before.

28:57.750 --> 28:59.417
- Attention, all crew,
I need everybody

28:59.417 --> 29:01.250
in the crew mess in five.

29:01.250 --> 29:03.667
- I do not want to sit in this
tip meeting because if

29:03.708 --> 29:08.583
my f--- up cost the crew tip,
like, it's not gonna be good.

29:08.625 --> 29:11.167
- Okay. Um...

29:11.208 --> 29:14.917
I don't think this was
by far our best effort.

29:14.917 --> 29:18.458
We would fall on our ass
more than once,

29:18.458 --> 29:21.292
have to pick ourselves up
and recover,

29:21.292 --> 29:24.083
especially with Dean.

29:24.125 --> 29:25.417
We got one more charter.

29:25.458 --> 29:27.792
I want you guys
to stay focused.

29:27.792 --> 29:31.208
Keep your goddamn head
in the game.

29:31.250 --> 29:34.625
And on that note,
Mr. Slover...

29:34.667 --> 29:37.292
he was happier than I was.

29:37.292 --> 29:40.292
He was happy
to the tune of

29:40.292 --> 29:41.958
26 grand.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.625
- Wow.
- Holy s---.

29:43.667 --> 29:47.917
- That's $2,350 each,

29:47.958 --> 29:50.125
and we've had a change.

29:50.167 --> 29:52.583
Nico's gonna be
senior deckhand,

29:52.625 --> 29:55.625
and I expect everybody
to give him the same cooperation

29:55.625 --> 29:58.458
they would give Kelley or me.

29:58.458 --> 29:59.458
Ben.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.292
Lauren.
- Thank you.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.292
- It's the biggest tip
we've had all season,

30:03.333 --> 30:07.000
and it was a demanding charter,
but it's clearly paid off.

30:07.042 --> 30:10.000
- We are gonna work
until we get done.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.667
I'll give you guys a break.
You can get food,

30:11.708 --> 30:13.500
go off the boat,
and we've got one more charter.

30:13.542 --> 30:15.250
We've got 24 hours
to flip the boat,

30:15.292 --> 30:16.917
so I think you all got
a lot of work to do.

30:16.958 --> 30:18.333
- Yeah.

30:24.667 --> 30:26.583
- It's just gonna be
a quick check around the boat,

30:26.625 --> 30:27.917
straighten up the lines,

30:27.958 --> 30:29.333
straighten up
the boatswain locker.

30:29.375 --> 30:30.833
Other than that, you know,

30:30.833 --> 30:33.000
let's just kick ass
this last charter.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.500
Um, Nico, if I'm off the boat,
you're on it.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.500
One of us needs to be here
at all times.

30:37.500 --> 30:40.667
- Yeah, I agree.
- Let's get the boat done

30:40.667 --> 30:43.208
so he can spend
some time with his girl.

30:43.250 --> 30:44.667
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

30:44.708 --> 30:45.708
- All right?
Let's do this.

30:53.583 --> 30:55.458
- How are you feeling
about things with Ben?

30:55.500 --> 30:57.208
- I'm feeling good.
It's nice hanging out,

30:57.250 --> 31:00.208
but I think we could hang out
as friends or maybe better.

31:00.250 --> 31:01.667
- But you guys have kissed.

31:01.708 --> 31:03.333
Like, how do you think
he feels about that?

31:05.375 --> 31:07.542
- That's dating.
Okay, so you want to date.

31:07.542 --> 31:09.708
- But I don't know if I want
to get it going any further

31:09.750 --> 31:12.542
in the dating-dating, yeah.
- Really? Okay.

31:12.542 --> 31:16.625
- I knew me dating Ben
would cause some sort of issue.

31:16.667 --> 31:18.917
I don't want to get
in the way of him and Kate...

31:21.083 --> 31:23.042
When it comes to the arguments.

31:23.083 --> 31:25.667
- That's so funny.
- It's a very difficult dynamic

31:25.708 --> 31:28.250
to deal with, and I don't know
at this point in time

31:28.250 --> 31:30.708
if I can cope with it very well.

31:30.750 --> 31:32.250
- So does that turn you off?

31:39.083 --> 31:41.250
- You might want to
go look down the dock.

31:41.250 --> 31:42.833
Yeah, pretty sure
I just saw her.

31:42.875 --> 31:44.167
- I think it might be her.

31:53.917 --> 31:55.542
- Oh, it is.

31:56.917 --> 31:58.708
I'm really happy to see her.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.375
I didn't realize how much I was
gonna miss her until I got here.

32:01.417 --> 32:02.917
This is Kelley.
- Hi.

32:02.958 --> 32:04.542
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- I hope so.

32:04.583 --> 32:06.083
You okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.625
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

32:07.667 --> 32:09.292
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you. Okay.

32:09.292 --> 32:11.125
- This is Nico.
- Nice to finally meet you.

32:11.167 --> 32:12.625
- Sierra.
- Hi.

32:12.625 --> 32:13.958
- Nice to meet you.
I love your nails.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.583
- Thank you.

32:15.625 --> 32:17.458
- I feel for Ashley being
in a relationship

32:17.500 --> 32:19.125
with someone like Kyle.

32:19.125 --> 32:21.292
I feel like
Kyle's very sketchy.

32:21.292 --> 32:23.250
That's not what I want
for my life.

32:23.292 --> 32:25.458
- Kyle.

32:25.458 --> 32:26.583
- What?

32:31.292 --> 32:32.625
- Yeah.

32:32.625 --> 32:34.375
- Hello.
I thought I'd come and meet you.

32:34.417 --> 32:35.875
I heard you were
getting a tour.

32:35.917 --> 32:37.292
- Hi.
- Lovely to meet you.

32:37.292 --> 32:39.292
- You too. You okay?
- Yes. How are you?

32:39.292 --> 32:42.625
- Curly blonde.
- I'm curly blonde, yes.

32:42.667 --> 32:45.125
- She looks like
the classic girl

32:45.125 --> 32:48.500
you'd get from Manchester.

32:48.500 --> 32:51.000
Eyelashes, hair extensions,

32:51.042 --> 32:54.000
fake nails,
absolutely lovely,

32:54.000 --> 32:56.583
but a typical girl
from Manchester.

33:05.833 --> 33:07.208
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:09.333 --> 33:11.167
- He's working?
Okay, come sit and chat.

33:11.167 --> 33:14.000
We're very happy you made it
and were able to have time.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.458
- I know.
- So how did you and Kyle meet?

33:44.042 --> 33:45.708
- I think Ashley's cool.
I like her a lot.

33:45.708 --> 33:49.042
She seems like more
of a girly-girl,

33:49.042 --> 33:51.042
but also kind of sassy.

33:54.042 --> 33:55.250
- Yeah, I can tell.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.625
- You turn these rooms
around, don't you?

33:58.667 --> 34:00.792
- I know, I did it--
I did it earlier.

34:00.833 --> 34:02.208
- You're amazing.

34:02.208 --> 34:05.208
Since you're here, actually,
um....

34:05.250 --> 34:07.542
would you like to go
on a date tonight?

34:07.542 --> 34:09.667
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:09.708 --> 34:12.083
- Or maybe we meet up
with the crew or something.

34:12.125 --> 34:13.750
It'd be nice to--
do you think it'd be nice?

34:13.792 --> 34:16.708
- Mm.
- The whole night is--

34:16.750 --> 34:18.542
'Cause we've only got
a couple of charters left,

34:18.583 --> 34:19.917
it'd be nice
to associate ourselves

34:19.917 --> 34:21.917
with the crew a bit,
as well.

34:21.917 --> 34:23.750
- I know, but just...

34:23.750 --> 34:26.917
I'm absolutely shocked by
Emily's answer.

34:26.917 --> 34:28.750
Got this amazing place
lined up.

34:28.792 --> 34:30.083
- Oh, do you?
- Oh, yeah.

34:30.083 --> 34:34.083
It is, it is. I--

34:34.125 --> 34:35.917
- It's--it's good
'cause we've only got

34:35.958 --> 34:37.250
a couple of chances left,

34:37.292 --> 34:40.833
and we should spend
some time with them.

34:40.875 --> 34:44.583
- I'm not sure what Emily
is thinking right now.

34:44.625 --> 34:48.750
Why the hell would she want
to hang out with anyone else?

34:48.750 --> 34:50.750
Okay, well, then I'll--
I'll see you later.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.500
- Um, okay. Cool.
- Yeah.

34:53.958 --> 34:55.042
- Coming up...

34:56.333 --> 34:58.792
- Right?
- You're a f---ing asshole.

35:04.625 --> 35:05.708
- Thank you so much.

35:05.750 --> 35:07.958
I needed it.

35:11.750 --> 35:15.208
On the dot at 6:00.

35:15.250 --> 35:17.083
- What are you doing?
Why are you working?

35:17.125 --> 35:18.292
- 'Cause there's stuff
to be done.

35:18.333 --> 35:19.792
- Could you take a break,
please?

35:19.792 --> 35:21.958
- No.
- Yes. Just take a break.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.792
Stop it.
Just chill out.

35:23.792 --> 35:26.417
- You're a f---ing legend.

35:26.458 --> 35:27.792
- Well, now,
we'll go for a drink.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.083
- Take a break. Come on.
- I'm fine.

35:30.125 --> 35:33.500
- I'm gonna get a drink
if you would like to join.

35:33.500 --> 35:36.500
- I think I will.
- Okay, brilliant.

35:36.500 --> 35:37.875
- You look stunning.

35:41.458 --> 35:42.583
- F---.

35:42.625 --> 35:44.333
Problem is,
is relationships

35:44.333 --> 35:47.417
is all about timing,
and I'm at that point.

35:47.458 --> 35:49.333
I want to settle down now.

35:49.375 --> 35:52.000
Unfortunately,
Emily is a young pup,

35:52.042 --> 35:54.167
and the timing could be wrong,

35:54.208 --> 35:57.125
but I'm willing to give it
my best shot.

36:02.833 --> 36:03.833
- Madame.

36:11.500 --> 36:15.125
- Yeah. Everyone's all right
on the boat except Sierra.

36:15.167 --> 36:17.667
I don't like her.
- Why, though?

36:25.583 --> 36:27.333
I said, "Oh, let's go out,
the whole thing."

36:30.083 --> 36:32.625
- Right.

36:41.208 --> 36:43.042
And I was just like,
"That's a f---ing cheap jab,

36:43.042 --> 36:46.208
love, a cheap jab."
- Below the belt.

36:46.208 --> 36:48.458
Did she go below the belt?

36:50.167 --> 36:52.375
- No.
- No, okay.

36:52.417 --> 36:55.875
- Nothing happened.

36:55.917 --> 36:59.083
- Why would you go on
a date with Sierra?

36:59.083 --> 37:02.208
That's just questionable
behavior to me.

37:02.250 --> 37:03.583
- We were fishing.

37:08.083 --> 37:09.750
- If you're gonna muck me off,
let me know.

37:09.750 --> 37:11.583
That wasn't a free pass.

37:11.583 --> 37:15.250
That was a "make sure
you don't muck me off."

37:15.250 --> 37:17.583
That was a check.
That was--

37:17.583 --> 37:21.083
- Maybe I read that wrong.
- You're a f---ing asshole.

37:21.083 --> 37:23.875
- I generally thought that she
wasn't that bothered about it,

37:23.917 --> 37:25.542
but obviously she is,

37:25.583 --> 37:27.917
and it just shows
that this person gives a sh--,

37:27.917 --> 37:28.917
and I'm not used to that.

37:31.458 --> 37:34.083
Well, you know.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.458
- Oh, my God.
I see Leon.

37:45.125 --> 37:47.250
- I'm completely rattled
right now.

37:47.292 --> 37:50.958
I'm not sure where I stand
with Emily at this point,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.417
so I'm hoping she shows up

37:53.458 --> 37:55.708
because I'd like to
clear the air.

38:00.625 --> 38:03.792
I am sorry.
- Oh, did you order champagne?

38:03.792 --> 38:05.625
- Yeah.
- True Ben style.

38:05.625 --> 38:07.458
- Well, you know.

38:07.458 --> 38:10.292
- Thank you.

38:10.333 --> 38:13.958
- So we had a really
nice thing going on, and--

38:13.958 --> 38:15.792
- And why do we not still?

38:15.833 --> 38:17.292
- We do.

38:17.292 --> 38:19.708
I mean, do we?
I don't know.

38:19.750 --> 38:23.667
- Um, it's fine
if we enjoy going,

38:23.667 --> 38:25.333
you know, dates
and we can have a kiss, but--

38:25.333 --> 38:27.125
- Okay.
All right, all right, all right.

38:27.167 --> 38:29.458
Let's just lay this out, please,
if you don't mind.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.000
- Okay.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.792
I'm having fun dating you,

38:32.833 --> 38:36.000
but I have fears about things
leading into a relationship

38:36.000 --> 38:37.458
'cause I know
I'm not ready for that,

38:37.500 --> 38:39.125
so I think it's easier, just--

38:39.167 --> 38:41.458
a really good friendship,
that'd be great.

38:43.667 --> 38:46.333
- I expected a little more,
but, you know, it's all right.

38:49.833 --> 38:51.333
The fact is,
I think you're quite cute.

38:51.375 --> 38:53.667
You know,
and I'm enjoying this time,

38:53.708 --> 38:57.292
and that's all I'm really
caring about, to be honest.

38:57.333 --> 38:58.667
I'm not thinking
of the future.

38:58.667 --> 39:00.625
I'm not thinking
about anything else.

39:00.667 --> 39:03.542
- Ben's extremely spontaneous,
and he lives in the moment,

39:03.542 --> 39:05.708
and as a person,
I need to learn to do that more,

39:05.750 --> 39:09.042
and it's very enriching,
being with someone like that,

39:09.083 --> 39:11.208
and there's a definite
attraction there.

39:11.250 --> 39:14.208
- Can I kiss you? Please?

39:21.208 --> 39:23.708
- Yeah.
Can I put on your glasses?

39:23.708 --> 39:25.167
- Yes.
- Always wanted to.

39:25.208 --> 39:26.208
Sweet.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.542
F---ing hell,
I feel dizzy.

39:29.542 --> 39:32.500
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

39:32.542 --> 39:34.000
You can come stay
in a hotel with me?

39:34.042 --> 39:36.500
- What?
- Come on.

39:36.542 --> 39:41.042
Like, non-sexual.
Just, like, watch a movie.

39:41.042 --> 39:42.375
There'd be two twins.

39:45.750 --> 39:48.583
- I'm just thinking.

39:48.583 --> 39:52.250
- Just say what you feel.
Whatever.

39:52.250 --> 39:53.583
- Yeah.

40:07.125 --> 40:08.750
- How did it go?
- They have to have someone

40:08.792 --> 40:10.417
to sign off to say

40:10.417 --> 40:12.500
that they're taking care
of you the whole time,

40:12.542 --> 40:17.083
so you need to make sure
that you're not gonna be away,

40:17.125 --> 40:19.333
'cause I need
someone there 24/7

40:19.375 --> 40:22.083
'cause I'm not gonna be able
to do anything for a bit.

40:22.083 --> 40:24.583
- There's a big thing about
to happen in Ashley's life.

40:24.625 --> 40:29.292
Her whole body is being
completely transformed,

40:29.292 --> 40:31.125
and she wants me to be
a part of that.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.792
- They need to know that

40:48.792 --> 40:50.708
to care about me
and be there for me,

40:50.750 --> 40:52.750
and if you can't do that,
if you don't want to do that,

40:52.792 --> 40:55.958
you don't have to.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.792
- And, you know...

40:57.833 --> 40:59.625
- I mean, there's something
to be said, though,

40:59.667 --> 41:01.333
about two and a half years.
- Yeah, I know.

41:03.125 --> 41:04.958
- Yeah, and how many times
have I still been here?

41:05.000 --> 41:06.792
- Yeah, but I just--

41:06.792 --> 41:10.917
Do you really want to share that
moment of your life with me?

41:10.958 --> 41:14.250
Do you?

41:14.292 --> 41:16.500
I am gonna be--
it's not just the fact

41:16.500 --> 41:18.167
that I'm gonna be there
taking care of you.

41:18.167 --> 41:19.500
I am going to be with you

41:19.542 --> 41:22.583
every step of the way
during that process.

41:22.625 --> 41:24.750
I'm happy to do it.
I want to do it.

41:44.667 --> 41:46.167
- Give me a kiss.

41:50.542 --> 41:52.792
- Work really hard, and I'll see
you in a couple of days.

41:52.833 --> 41:54.708
- Hey, baby.

41:54.708 --> 41:55.833
- Hey, baby!

41:58.167 --> 41:59.500
- Love you.
- I love you.

42:01.917 --> 42:03.458
- What's up?

42:03.500 --> 42:04.875
- You do travel light,
don't you?

42:13.583 --> 42:14.792
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

42:16.042 --> 42:18.208
- These seasons are too short,

42:18.250 --> 42:21.208
so when you meet a girl
that potentially

42:21.208 --> 42:22.375
could be
really good for you...

42:22.375 --> 42:23.875
After you, love.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.708
You've kind of got
to seize the moment.

42:25.708 --> 42:27.958
We have a room.
We'd like to check in.

42:29.875 --> 42:31.917
- Next on "Below Deck."
- Last charter group.

42:31.917 --> 42:34.083
- These are former models.

42:34.083 --> 42:35.083
High maintenance.

42:35.125 --> 42:37.208
- Whoo!
- So naughty.

42:37.250 --> 42:38.583
- Emily, Emily, Kate.

42:38.625 --> 42:40.500
- Ben and Emily.
Bemily.

42:40.542 --> 42:41.917
Whatever.

42:41.917 --> 42:43.917
Emily, Emily.
You're fired.

42:43.958 --> 42:45.375
- Is Kate calling me?

42:45.417 --> 42:47.750
I probably f---ing
hate you sometimes.

42:47.750 --> 42:49.250
- I know, really--
- Like, I want to kill you.

42:49.250 --> 42:51.250
- I just look at you,
and I hate you.

42:51.292 --> 42:54.417
Every beverage is getting me
that much closer to freedom.

42:54.417 --> 42:56.667
- So I'm not on break?
- No, we're not gonna do breaks.

42:56.708 --> 42:58.417
- What?
- I think

42:58.417 --> 43:00.375
I got what you're doing,
but don't take it too far.

43:00.417 --> 43:02.417
- If you don't want to go
to your happy-groovy place,

43:02.458 --> 43:04.542
you can go make beds
and clean the toilets.

43:04.583 --> 43:05.750
- Kate's a sh--,

43:05.792 --> 43:07.500
and just the way
she talks to the girls--

43:07.542 --> 43:09.542
- She's a f---ing bitch.
- Yeah.

43:09.583 --> 43:11.208
- I don't know what's happening.

43:12.917 --> 43:15.875
