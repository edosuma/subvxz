I need you to find out as much
information as you can.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.533
If he's going to give her money,
what he wants in return.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.135
I can't do that.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.971
Yes, you can.

18:25.071 --> 18:26.839
You need to ask her
how the meeting went.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.176
You see if she talks about it
and listen to her phone calls

18:29.276 --> 18:31.444
especially if they're
with Koscielny.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.413
You find a reason to be
in her office. It's very simple.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.148
She won't suspect anything.
It's easy.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.550
Trust me, nothing will happen.

18:39.386 --> 18:40.987
I don't know.
I don't like doing this.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.289
I know, it'll be over soon.

18:42.389 --> 18:43.723
- When?
- A couple of weeks.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.126
Maybe less.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.162
Deal?

18:50.363 --> 18:52.265
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.666
I'll talk to you soon.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.646

19:09.816 --> 19:11.684
Ms. Myles, please come in.

CHIESURIN:
Here, let me take your coat.

19:15.888 --> 19:16.856
I'll hang it up for you.

19:16.956 --> 19:17.757
Thank you.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.461
[ indistinct chatter ]

19:21.561 --> 19:23.530
KOSCIELNY:
This is it.

19:23.630 --> 19:24.697
Correct.

19:27.334 --> 19:30.169
Erica? Peter Koscielny.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.471
Please have a seat.

19:34.241 --> 19:38.110
So, Greg filled you in
on my desire to help.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.213
He did, he mentioned
your need for anonymity

19:40.313 --> 19:41.481
which shouldn't be a problem.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.750
A number of our donors
have the same requirement.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.952
And also that you are
looking to contribute

19:46.052 --> 19:48.221
fifteen million to start with.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.956
Do you know who Martin Hoban is?

19:50.056 --> 19:52.158
The Canadian industrialist?

19:52.259 --> 19:53.793
We're thinking more along
the lines of 25.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.697
What's your relationship
with Hoban?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.632
Let's just say we have
similar business interests.

20:01.468 --> 20:04.136
As a non-US citizen,
it's illegal for Mr. Hoban

20:04.237 --> 20:07.206
to make donations
to US super PACs

20:07.307 --> 20:08.975
and it's illegal
for me to accept them.

20:09.075 --> 20:11.378
That won't be a problem.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.746
We'll route the payment through
a series of shell companies

20:13.846 --> 20:16.349
registered in the US
that I control.

20:16.449 --> 20:17.750
No one will ever know.

20:20.086 --> 20:22.255
What are you looking for
in return?

20:22.355 --> 20:24.156
We know that Peter Lorimer
is vacating his office

20:24.257 --> 20:27.226
of Secretary of Energy early,
and that Sussman

20:27.327 --> 20:31.197
is on the administration's
shortlist to succeed him.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.333
We're interested in forming
a relationship with him.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.504
We also want to know
who else is on that list.

20:37.604 --> 20:40.707
- Why?
- That's funny.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.008
KOSCIELNY:
You don't strike me
as the naive type.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.711
You must know as well as I do

20:44.811 --> 20:45.878
that everyone
can be influenced.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.582
Hoban also wants Sussman to know

20:49.682 --> 20:51.818
where the money
is coming from...

20:51.918 --> 20:53.786
...off the record.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.722
Even if I could get it,
I'm not sure

20:55.822 --> 20:57.790
there's a definitive list
at this point.

20:57.890 --> 21:00.560
KOSCIELNY:
There is.
Look, let me make it clear.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.029
We expect a return
on our investment.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.333
I'm confident you'll find a way.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.837
I'll see what I can do.

21:31.358 --> 21:32.892
Are you asleep?

21:34.527 --> 21:36.463
- Erica?
- Mm-hm?

I'm gonna see you

You know?

My heart begins to race
and I even get a little nervous.
