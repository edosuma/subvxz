WEBVTT

00:04.003 --> 00:06.423
So when you say you're sure,
how sure are you?

00:06.632 --> 00:08.634
Sure enough that if you don't
ask her out by tomorrow,

00:08.842 --> 00:10.886
l'm gonna spike your coffee
with testosterone, man.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.346
Yeah, but what if you're wrong?

00:12.554 --> 00:15.599
- J.B., trust me, the girl's into you.
- Oh, hey, careful.

00:16.433 --> 00:20.229
Relax. This guy's a Marine.

00:20.479 --> 00:22.940
At least he was before he deployed
himself through his windshield.

00:23.565 --> 00:24.775
So, what do l say to her?

00:24.983 --> 00:27.569
l don't know. What do l look like,
the Cyrano de what's-his-face guy?

00:27.778 --> 00:30.072
Go with your gut.
You got the release?

00:30.322 --> 00:32.323
No, didn't you get it?

00:32.573 --> 00:35.410
You know what? On second thought,
maybe you better not go with your gut.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.668
So where should l take her?

00:42.835 --> 00:45.587
l'm gonna start charging you
for advice, you know?

00:47.005 --> 00:49.675
Oh, there she is.

00:55.347 --> 00:58.308
- Do you smell that?
- Gas.

01:04.022 --> 01:07.109
Oh, no. Get out.
Get out, get out, get out. Go, go, go.

02:15.502 --> 02:16.670
What are you doing?

02:17.588 --> 02:19.840
l'm in the middle
of a very serious negotiation.

02:20.049 --> 02:21.050
On McGee's computer?

02:22.635 --> 02:25.888
l know where you're going with this,
and the answer is yes.

02:26.096 --> 02:27.723
And what's the question?

02:30.267 --> 02:32.061
Have l no shame?

02:32.895 --> 02:34.521
Who are you lM'ing?

02:34.730 --> 02:37.691
Agent Larsen?

02:40.611 --> 02:42.780
And she thinks you're McGee?

02:45.115 --> 02:48.786
And this is because she warned you
that if you spoke to her again,

02:49.078 --> 02:51.747
she would have you brought up
on sexual-harassment charges?

02:51.914 --> 02:54.792
- That was a misunderstanding.
- So now you're correcting the record.

02:55.084 --> 02:56.710
l'm just trying to let her know that l--

02:57.461 --> 03:00.589
McGee feels that
she may have misjudged me,

03:01.924 --> 03:03.551
and that as a close, personal friend,
l can--

03:03.759 --> 03:05.886
''Vouch for Tony's
strength of character.''

03:07.096 --> 03:08.389
Yeah.

03:10.599 --> 03:12.935
l don't have much time.
She's being reassigned in two days.

03:13.143 --> 03:15.396
Yeah, well, you'll be reassigned
if Gibbs catches you.

03:15.604 --> 03:16.981
Doing what?

03:17.147 --> 03:19.650
We were looking at McGee's
bookmarks, trying to get an idea for a--

03:19.858 --> 03:21.318
Birthday present.

03:21.527 --> 03:24.071
- Morning.
- Happy birthday, probie.

03:24.280 --> 03:27.116
- lt's a bagel.
- lt's not my birthday.

03:27.283 --> 03:31.120
Grab your gear.
Medical transport just exploded.

03:36.834 --> 03:40.170
- Any day now, probie.
- Yep. Sorry.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.930
l just got the strangest lM.

03:54.143 --> 03:56.437
- She asked you out? You?
- Yeah.

03:56.645 --> 03:58.272
Trust me, l'm just as surprised
as you are.

03:58.522 --> 04:00.107
Trust me, you're not.

04:00.316 --> 04:03.193
Blast radius indicates
a low-yield detonation.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.820
Did she say why?

04:08.032 --> 04:11.035
lt said that she liked the loyalty
l showed my coworkers.

04:11.202 --> 04:14.788
Pyrolysis on the pavement suggests
an O2 was the primary accelerant.

04:15.039 --> 04:18.209
Even if they were total scum.
No idea what she was referring to.

04:18.416 --> 04:21.462
l'll tell you though, l did not realize she
was paying so much attention to me.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.048
Do you wanna tell the probie
or should l?

04:24.632 --> 04:27.218
How about neither?
Why don't you just focus on the work?

04:27.468 --> 04:31.138
Yeah, l've noticed you've morphed
into quite the forensic expert.

04:31.347 --> 04:34.975
l'm lsraeli. This isn't
my first exploding ambulance.

04:35.184 --> 04:37.478
We left the van unattended for four,
maybe five minutes, tops.

04:37.686 --> 04:40.231
- As Patto hit the brakes--
- The whole thing exploded into flames.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.400
- l think someone's trying to kill us.
- Would you please stop that, J.B.?

04:43.609 --> 04:46.820
- lt was-- lt was an accident.
- Who's trying to kill you?

04:47.029 --> 04:49.031
Who knows?
There's a lot of weirdoes out there.

04:50.533 --> 04:52.535
Tell me about it.

04:52.743 --> 04:56.664
- Talk to me, Duck.
- Lance Corporal William Danforth Jr.

04:56.872 --> 05:00.334
Survived lEDs in lraq,
RPGs in Afghanistan.

05:00.626 --> 05:04.338
<i>Unfortunately,
the local Odocoileus virginianus</i>

05:04.547 --> 05:06.006
was too much to bear.

05:06.215 --> 05:09.718
- That's a white-tailed deer.
- Yeah, l know.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.887
Are you saying
Bambi killed this Marine, Ducky?

05:12.096 --> 05:17.309
No, but swerving at 60 miles an hour
into a tree to avoid Bambi did.

05:17.560 --> 05:20.396
And his girlfriend is still in a coma
at the hospital.

05:20.563 --> 05:23.107
Danforth was DOA
when they brought him in last night.

05:23.357 --> 05:26.527
This morning, he was on his way
to Bethesda for a routine autopsy

05:26.735 --> 05:28.529
when fate intervened.

05:28.737 --> 05:29.863
Fate?

05:30.072 --> 05:33.784
Well, the scorching of the body
is consistent with a gasoline fire

05:33.993 --> 05:36.579
accelerated by onboard oxygen.

05:36.787 --> 05:39.123
This could have been a accident,
Jethro.

05:39.331 --> 05:43.794
- Lucky for those two to get out.
- Yeah, lucky in a way l don't like.

05:44.044 --> 05:47.464
<i>Good morning, good morning</i>

05:47.673 --> 05:49.216
Morning.

05:49.425 --> 05:51.051
<i>Good...</i>

05:51.677 --> 05:57.349
<i>Good morning to you
You, you and you</i>

05:57.600 --> 05:59.852
<i>Good--</i>

06:00.102 --> 06:03.063
- What's that?
- Looks like an iPod.

06:04.440 --> 06:05.733
iPod Photo.

06:05.941 --> 06:08.611
Anyone who might have possibly
had a motive to try to kill them--

06:08.819 --> 06:11.196
Either has an alibi or is out of town.
Way ahead of you.

06:11.447 --> 06:13.157
You could've told me
and saved me the trouble.

06:13.324 --> 06:15.534
Just say you need the practice
and leave it at that.

06:15.743 --> 06:19.455
What kind of music
does the McGee listen to?

06:20.873 --> 06:25.920
Barry Manilow. Julie Andrews?
Zamfir.

06:26.462 --> 06:29.131
- Let's go to photos.
- What are you doing?

06:29.298 --> 06:32.760
Well, McGee had a date
with Agent Larsen last night.

06:32.968 --> 06:36.555
Didn't return any of my e-mails
about a SitRep.

06:36.805 --> 06:38.599
But maybe he took some photos.

06:38.766 --> 06:43.938
- Those are his private photos.
- Well, he left them on his public desk.

06:44.980 --> 06:47.107
Where's the clickety?

06:50.194 --> 06:53.531
- Who is this?
- Well, it's definitely not Agent Larsen.

06:53.739 --> 06:56.116
- Gotta be his sister.
- Why?

06:56.367 --> 06:59.036
Are you kidding?
This girl's way out of McGeek's league.

06:59.245 --> 07:01.288
l don't think
the drivers were the target, Tony.

07:01.497 --> 07:02.540
Yeah.

07:02.748 --> 07:05.042
- l actually think it was the body.
- Why blow up a dead guy?

07:05.251 --> 07:08.462
- Put it back up there.
- Put what back?

07:11.757 --> 07:15.094
McGee's got good taste.
Going for coffee.

07:16.512 --> 07:18.973
- What was that for?
- Alerting DiNozzo.

07:24.019 --> 07:29.525
The fuel line to the gas-tank cap
was ruptured here.

07:30.067 --> 07:32.736
Torn by a loose belt
on the differential housing.

07:32.945 --> 07:33.988
- Loosened how?
- Unknown.

07:34.196 --> 07:37.157
The van also had
a short in the electrical system,

07:37.366 --> 07:40.703
coincidentally in the taillight
right by our ruptured fuel line.

07:40.911 --> 07:42.955
You know how l feel
about coincidences, Abs.

07:43.205 --> 07:46.125
Equatorial pygmies know how you feel
about coincidences, Gibbs.

07:46.375 --> 07:49.378
So one would wonder,
accident or not an accident?

07:49.587 --> 07:50.671
That is the question.

07:50.880 --> 07:54.592
Our first player,
an innocent differential-housing bolt

07:54.800 --> 07:56.802
that is rubbing and straining
on the molecular bonds

07:57.052 --> 07:58.846
of our vulcanized fuel line

07:59.054 --> 08:02.349
until, after eons,
our hapless hose finally ruptures.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.436
The gas moves quickly
into the floorboard of the van

08:05.644 --> 08:07.855
when it's in motion.
The driver smells it.

08:08.063 --> 08:10.107
What could it be?
He hits the brakes,

08:10.316 --> 08:13.527
and the short in the taillight
ignites the pooling gas vapours.

08:13.736 --> 08:16.906
The flames quickly superheat
the onboard O2,

08:17.114 --> 08:19.658
and when the canisters can no longer
contain the growing pressure:

08:20.576 --> 08:21.869
Not an accident.

08:22.536 --> 08:25.831
Not unless the Angel of Death is
going through a Rube Goldberg stage.

08:26.081 --> 08:27.625
Boss, we found remnants

08:27.833 --> 08:30.044
of what may have been the trigger
on an O2 canister.

08:30.252 --> 08:31.629
May have been, McGee?

08:31.795 --> 08:33.631
There were traces
of mercury fulminate,

08:33.839 --> 08:35.299
sodium azide and tetryl
on the material.

08:35.466 --> 08:37.592
- Blasting cap.
- O2 would've never blown on its own.

08:37.801 --> 08:38.885
Fire wasn't hot enough.

08:39.135 --> 08:41.554
The perp rigged the transport
to make it look like an accident.

08:41.764 --> 08:43.890
He might've gotten away with it
if he'd detonated it sooner.

08:44.099 --> 08:46.227
Fire dispersed pieces of the trigger.

08:48.270 --> 08:52.483
- He waited for the drivers to get out.
- So he's not a murderer.

08:52.691 --> 08:56.487
Well, at least, he wasn't trying
to kill the ambulance drivers.

08:56.695 --> 08:57.738
Trace it.

08:57.947 --> 09:01.116
Gibbs, this is a garden-variety,
laminated-paper substrate.

09:01.408 --> 09:04.411
lt's used as a cheap shielding
in thousands of electronic devices.

09:04.620 --> 09:06.163
Yeah, so?

09:06.372 --> 09:08.832
So maybe l should
get back to work.

09:09.083 --> 09:11.293
Did we get a positive match
on our Marine's DNA?

09:11.502 --> 09:14.922
You know, l've been a little busy here,
Gibbs, with all the rubbing

09:15.130 --> 09:18.259
and the looking and the analyzing
and the...

09:18.467 --> 09:20.636
l should mention
that Ducky's taking care of it.

09:23.430 --> 09:28.561
l haven't seen a body this badly burned
since the Bertram Mills Circus.

09:28.811 --> 09:30.354
Specimen jar.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.899
- Mr. Palmer.
- Sorry, doctor.

09:34.149 --> 09:36.986
lt's just, l'm having a problem
with this smell today.

09:37.152 --> 09:41.615
Really? l think he smells
like my mother's fried chicken.

09:41.824 --> 09:45.953
- Yeah, that would be the problem.
- Oh, l see.

09:46.495 --> 09:48.455
Well, the vegetarian lifestyle

09:48.664 --> 09:51.625
has been medically proven
to be the healthiest of choices.

09:51.834 --> 09:54.795
Perhaps it's time
you made the jump.

09:55.004 --> 09:59.383
- You wanted to see me, Duck?
- Well, actually, yes, Jethro.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.302
Then why do you look surprised
to see me?

10:01.510 --> 10:04.805
Because l haven't told you
that l wanted to see you.

10:05.014 --> 10:06.974
Yes. Well...

10:07.933 --> 10:12.146
...our latest houseguest
has thrown us quite the little mystery.

10:12.354 --> 10:13.606
Define mystery.

10:13.814 --> 10:17.192
Yeah, well,
the young lad's death certificate

10:17.401 --> 10:20.779
lists blunt-force, thoracic trauma
as the cause of death,

10:21.030 --> 10:23.449
typical in motor-vehicle accidents.

10:23.699 --> 10:25.951
But l've only partially been able
to verify that,

10:26.702 --> 10:31.165
since, as you can see,
the post-mortem damage is extensive.

10:31.373 --> 10:32.833
- Ducky?
- Yes?

10:33.083 --> 10:35.294
- Mystery.
- Of course.

10:35.544 --> 10:36.587
Well, you know me, Jethro,

10:36.795 --> 10:39.548
l attempted to make
a identification myself.

10:40.549 --> 10:45.512
The blast destroyed his jaw
and shattered his teeth.

10:45.721 --> 10:47.806
lt would take
an inordinate amount of time

10:48.057 --> 10:51.185
to get an identification
from dental records.

10:51.477 --> 10:56.273
Also, the fire so degraded
his DNA, that,

10:56.482 --> 11:00.069
you know, l spent the better part
of yesterday scouring his body.

11:00.361 --> 11:02.655
- Mystery.
- Almost there.

11:02.905 --> 11:07.493
By a stroke of luck,
l found a piece of tissue

11:07.743 --> 11:13.082
viable enough to send
to have run against Danforth's DNA

11:13.290 --> 11:16.377
at the Armed Forces Repository.

11:19.797 --> 11:22.132
This isn't William Danforth Jr.

11:25.177 --> 11:26.387
Then who is this?

11:26.595 --> 11:30.808
That, my dear Jethro,
is the mystery.

11:39.525 --> 11:43.821
Lance Corporal Danforth's
pro and cons were 50-50.

11:44.071 --> 11:47.741
A real squirreled-away Marine.
So, what'd you find, Tony?

11:48.534 --> 11:49.743
Tony.

11:51.328 --> 11:55.082
Zamfir, he's a master
of the pan flute.

11:55.624 --> 11:57.585
- lt's helping me think.
- What are you thinking?

11:57.835 --> 12:00.045
l'm thinking
that there are a lot of reasons

12:00.296 --> 12:02.631
for post-mortem mutilation
you're overlooking,

12:02.882 --> 12:04.884
besides hiding a suspicious
cause of death.

12:05.134 --> 12:06.927
Such as?

12:07.177 --> 12:10.472
Such as enraged acts of violence,
sadistic curiosity.

12:10.723 --> 12:13.642
- Hiding the real identity of the victim.
- That was the next one on my list.

12:13.851 --> 12:15.811
- ls his identity in question?
- Yeah, it is now.

12:16.353 --> 12:17.605
Tony, get me a copy of--

12:17.855 --> 12:20.858
The names of the cops who processed
Danforth's report. Already on its way.

12:21.025 --> 12:22.818
- Ziva, take me--
- Have a chat with the doctor

12:23.027 --> 12:25.446
who pronounced the body dead.
Find out who made the lD.

12:25.654 --> 12:27.489
Hey, you want me to go
and supervise that, boss?

12:28.199 --> 12:31.660
Actually, you know, l'll stay here
just in case you need me.

12:32.453 --> 12:34.663
Zamfir. No, l'm not saying
you need me.

12:34.872 --> 12:37.875
That's a bad word.
Need's the wrong word.

12:38.042 --> 12:41.712
Oh, the director needs to see you
in her office ASAP.

12:55.726 --> 12:57.519
l was just gonna tell the director
you're here.

12:57.770 --> 12:59.063
Cynthia, did you know

12:59.271 --> 13:03.234
that when a Roman emperor
made a triumphal march into Rome,

13:03.442 --> 13:05.361
he had a slave on his chariot who--

13:05.569 --> 13:07.780
Who whispered, ''You're only human,''
into his ear.

13:07.988 --> 13:11.075
Going in unannounced
is whispering into her ear.

13:11.283 --> 13:12.743
So you're the director's slave.

13:19.083 --> 13:22.795
Cynthia is there to direct traffic,
Agent Gibbs.

13:23.045 --> 13:24.880
l'm just responding to your ASAP,
director.

13:27.550 --> 13:30.302
This is Lance Corporal Danforth's
father, William.

13:30.886 --> 13:35.182
- My sympathies, Mr. Danforth.
- Thank you, Agent Gibbs.

13:35.391 --> 13:38.310
The SECNAV would like us
to keep Mr. Danforth in the loop

13:38.561 --> 13:40.563
throughout the entire investigation.

13:40.771 --> 13:44.358
- More than usual?
- Yes.

13:45.234 --> 13:47.361
Gordo and l served together in Beirut,
Agent Gibbs,

13:47.570 --> 13:49.738
and quite frankly,
l'm using that friendship.

13:50.656 --> 13:52.658
- Wouldn't you?
- He would.

13:53.325 --> 13:57.288
- Sixth or eighth?
- Two-six, Fox Company.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.624
One-one, scout sniper platoon.

14:01.959 --> 14:04.795
- Beirut?
- Desert Storm.

14:04.962 --> 14:06.922
So, what can you tell me
about my son, Agent Gibbs?

14:07.131 --> 14:09.049
Jethro.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.260
Bill.

14:11.468 --> 14:13.846
Only what l read in hospital
and police reports.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.848
Mr. Danforth has seen those.

14:16.056 --> 14:19.143
He's asking how his son's body
was incinerated.

14:19.351 --> 14:21.353
lt wasn't.

14:21.979 --> 14:23.772
AFlS couldn't match the body
in autopsy

14:23.981 --> 14:26.025
with Lance Corporal Danforth's
DNA.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.527
You're saying
that it isn't Mr. Danforth's son?

14:28.777 --> 14:30.487
Not according to AFlS.

14:31.864 --> 14:35.201
- Could there be a mistake?
- One in 9 million.

14:35.451 --> 14:37.912
- Have Abby rerun the DNA.
- Already on it, director.

14:38.162 --> 14:40.915
Well, if it's not Lance Corporal
Danforth, who the hell is it?

14:41.123 --> 14:42.666
l'll let you know when l find out.

14:44.251 --> 14:48.130
- What should l tell his mother?
- l wouldn't tell her anything yet.

14:48.339 --> 14:49.715
Right.

14:52.176 --> 14:53.344
My numbers.

14:54.261 --> 14:57.014
Director Shepard, l'll tell Gordo
how cooperative you've been.

14:57.181 --> 15:00.726
- Least we could do.
- Hey, Bill.

15:02.353 --> 15:04.188
Did you identify your son's body?

15:04.396 --> 15:08.525
No, the police notified us
that he had died.

15:08.776 --> 15:10.986
Said that his body
was being shipped to Bethesda.

15:11.195 --> 15:13.614
Do you think Billy...

15:13.822 --> 15:15.199
...could still be alive?

15:15.407 --> 15:17.660
l think the hospital transported
the wrong body.

15:25.042 --> 15:26.085
Bull.

15:26.335 --> 15:28.295
The Marine from two nights ago,
Danforth?

15:28.546 --> 15:30.089
Yeah, l remember him.

15:30.339 --> 15:32.383
- Are you the one who treated him?
- Treated, no.

15:32.591 --> 15:35.177
Unfortunately, all l did was pronounce
him dead, Agent McGee.

15:35.970 --> 15:38.639
- lt's hard to believe it's the same kid.
- Why is that?

15:38.806 --> 15:41.183
He was a mess.
Heavy contusions to the cranium,

15:41.392 --> 15:44.478
pronounced facial lacerations,
half his skull caved in.

15:44.687 --> 15:45.980
Who lD'd his body?

15:46.188 --> 15:48.065
A buddy gave us a tentative lD

15:48.274 --> 15:50.359
and we also pulled his license
from his wallet.

15:50.568 --> 15:51.735
This buddy have a name?

15:51.944 --> 15:54.780
Well, l can do better than that.
He's in lCU room five.

15:55.656 --> 15:57.199
The police report didn't
mention anything

15:57.408 --> 15:58.951
about a third injured party, doctor.

15:59.201 --> 16:02.621
That's because he wasn't injured,
Officer David. He's visiting.

16:02.872 --> 16:05.708
''Our souls are like those orphans

16:05.916 --> 16:12.548
whose unwedded mothers die
in bearing them.

16:12.756 --> 16:14.800
The secret of our pa--''

16:15.009 --> 16:17.761
Paternity lies in their graves,
and we must there to learn it.

16:17.970 --> 16:22.558
<i>- Herman Melville, Moby Dick.
- Call me lshmael.</i>

16:22.766 --> 16:26.312
lt's her favourite book.
The doctors said it might help.

16:26.562 --> 16:31.191
lt's helping give me a headache.
You're Rebecca's relatives?

16:31.442 --> 16:35.070
- No, NClS.
- Corporal Merrill, sir.

16:36.238 --> 16:37.406
At ease, Marine.

16:38.073 --> 16:40.034
We're only here
to ask you a few questions.

16:40.242 --> 16:43.579
Oh, of course, sir. l mean, ma'am.

16:48.626 --> 16:51.086
She doesn't like being called ma'am.
lt's okay though.

16:55.132 --> 16:57.801
This about Billy, ma-- Miss?

16:58.010 --> 17:00.596
lf you mean Lance Corporal Danforth,
yes.

17:00.804 --> 17:02.681
We understand
that you lD'd his body.

17:02.932 --> 17:07.228
Tried to.
Billy's face was all mashed up.

17:07.478 --> 17:09.855
How did you know it was him?

17:10.105 --> 17:14.318
Who else could it be?
He was in his car with Rebecca.

17:14.484 --> 17:17.738
- At least he was last time l saw him.
- Which was?

17:17.988 --> 17:20.449
The night he was killed.

17:21.534 --> 17:22.785
Feel free to elaborate.

17:24.118 --> 17:25.663
Tell us about that night.

17:27.665 --> 17:31.126
Billy had just landed stateside
after his second tour in lraq.

17:31.377 --> 17:36.173
So me, him and Rebecca,
Billy's girlfriend,

17:36.382 --> 17:39.260
we were out celebrating
at the Gold Monkey.

17:39.510 --> 17:41.470
- Celebrating meaning drinking?
- Not me, sir.

17:41.679 --> 17:44.265
Billy was, even though he shouldn't

17:44.473 --> 17:47.017
because he just shouldn't.

17:49.353 --> 17:54.858
l made Rebecca drive him home
because he looked pretty bad,

17:55.067 --> 17:58.195
like he was gonna puke
or something.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.447
You're a good friend.

18:00.656 --> 18:05.578
Me and Billy have been buds
since we was this big.

18:05.786 --> 18:07.663
He's the only one
that never made fun of my stutter.

18:07.872 --> 18:10.875
You saw Lance Corporal Danforth
get into the car?

18:11.083 --> 18:15.713
l put him in it.
Like l said, he was pretty drunk.

18:15.921 --> 18:21.051
l went back inside the bar
for maybe half an hour.

18:21.302 --> 18:27.933
When l left, l passed the accident
on my way home.

18:28.183 --> 18:32.563
Cops were already there,
said Billy's car hit at a d--

18:32.730 --> 18:36.066
lt's okay, corporal,
we read the police report.

18:36.275 --> 18:41.906
He was just lying there
all broken and bent up.

18:42.114 --> 18:45.451
They were trying to save him,

18:45.701 --> 18:48.537
but l knew, l just knew he was...

18:49.580 --> 18:53.959
Doctor said he probably
didn't feel anything.

18:54.710 --> 18:58.255
Think he was telling the truth
or just trying to make me feel better?

18:58.464 --> 19:01.884
Doctors do that, don't they?

19:05.054 --> 19:10.059
Well, in my experiences, ER doctors,
they usually tell it like it is.

19:16.774 --> 19:18.776
You got a favourite movie, huh?
Got a favourite movie?

19:24.114 --> 19:25.741
Ball, ball, ball.

19:28.452 --> 19:29.453
Who's your daddy now?

19:38.712 --> 19:40.881
Are you having fun, DiNozzo?

19:41.590 --> 19:45.302
- All done interviewing Danforth's CO?
- You done interviewing his platoon?

19:45.511 --> 19:47.888
Nothing builds rapport
like a good game of ball.

19:53.644 --> 19:56.230
- Thanks, guys.
- Yeah, later, man.

19:58.274 --> 20:00.401
The guys said
Danforth was a top Marine.

20:00.651 --> 20:03.320
But the word is, he only joined
because his father was a Marine.

20:04.738 --> 20:06.198
Little looser, please.

20:07.032 --> 20:11.078
My toes have gotten used to
the whole blood thing, circulation.

20:11.287 --> 20:12.288
DiNozzo.

20:12.496 --> 20:15.416
The word also is that he
was inseparable with another Marine,

20:15.666 --> 20:16.667
a corporal--

20:16.876 --> 20:18.002
- Kenneth Merrill.
- Yeah.

20:18.210 --> 20:20.421
Followed Danforth into the corps
on the buddy program.

20:20.629 --> 20:23.591
Course he did.
Guy's as loyal as a Saint Bernard.

20:23.841 --> 20:26.510
Would you just focus, please?

20:26.377 --> 20:28.004
And l'm starting to lose feeling
in my toe.

20:28.212 --> 20:29.672
- Does that look right?
- Yeah.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.174
Apparently he was as loyal
as a Saint Bernard.

20:32.883 --> 20:35.261
According to the CO, the corps
worked out pretty well for him.

20:35.469 --> 20:38.472
Oh, yeah. He got into boxing,
got his first girlfriend, and get this,

20:38.639 --> 20:40.474
turns out he had a knack
for disarming lEDs.

20:40.683 --> 20:44.061
- His platoon called him the--
- Forrest Gump of explosives.

20:45.980 --> 20:48.065
l'm not trying to do your job, am l?

20:51.277 --> 20:53.362
Put an ice pack on that. Fifteen on--

20:53.571 --> 20:56.240
Fifteen off. Yeah, l know the drill.
Thanks, corpsman.

20:58.326 --> 20:59.327
lt's real swollen.

20:59.535 --> 21:02.580
l don't think l'm gonna be able
to walk on this thing, boss.

21:04.081 --> 21:08.878
- Look at that. Look, it's a miracle.
- Yeah, loyal as a Saint Bernard.

21:09.128 --> 21:11.005
Always wanted to get one of those
until l found out

21:11.213 --> 21:14.216
they didn't come with that
barrel of whiskey around their neck.

21:16.010 --> 21:19.305
You're wondering if Merrill helped
his buddy fake his own death

21:19.513 --> 21:20.514
to get out of the corps?

21:20.723 --> 21:25.353
No. l'm wondering who they got to play
the part of the dead body.

21:32.701 --> 21:36.079
You really think Lance Corporal
Danforth faked his own death?

21:36.288 --> 21:37.414
You got a better theory?

21:37.622 --> 21:41.835
- Actually, we do, Tony.
- l'd like to hear it, Agent McGee.

21:42.044 --> 21:44.796
And yours as well, Agent DiNozzo.

21:53.388 --> 21:56.391
Both preferably some time today.

21:58.727 --> 22:02.939
We think Corporal Merrill
may have killed Danforth, director.

22:03.190 --> 22:04.274
Why?

22:05.192 --> 22:08.028
Merrill conveniently forgot to tell us
about the fight they had

22:08.236 --> 22:09.529
the night Danforth was killed.

22:09.738 --> 22:12.491
- A fight over what?
- Gibbs is not gonna like this.

22:17.162 --> 22:21.124
- ls there a problem, Agent McGee?
- No, no, ma'am.

22:22.084 --> 22:26.797
Merrill claims that he was trying to
stop him from drinking and driving.

22:27.672 --> 22:30.592
According to the bartender, they broke
two tables and a chair over it.

22:30.759 --> 22:33.220
Sounds like more
than two good friends fighting to me.

22:33.428 --> 22:37.224
l agree. Merrill also passed
Danforth's accident on the way home.

22:37.432 --> 22:39.059
He could have easily
finished him off.

22:39.267 --> 22:41.353
- No.
- Merrill goes to hide the body.

22:41.603 --> 22:44.523
And when he comes back to clean up,
the cops are already on the scene.

22:44.773 --> 22:46.316
What about the other body?

22:47.901 --> 22:49.277
There was a third party in the car.

22:49.861 --> 22:53.240
We only have Corporal Merrill's word
that the two of them drove off.

22:53.907 --> 22:57.661
No way. No way. Wrong.

22:58.453 --> 23:02.082
Merrill shows up at the hospital,
confirms the false lD.

23:02.290 --> 23:03.458
Then later, goes back,

23:03.667 --> 23:06.128
torches the ambulance
before the real lD can be made.

23:06.336 --> 23:10.298
Okay, l'm sorry,
l gotta interrupt because...

23:10.507 --> 23:12.509
Here's the thing.

23:12.718 --> 23:15.220
l have a theory
that actually has motive,

23:15.429 --> 23:18.682
which might be helpful. l don't mean
to belittle my colleagues' efforts.

23:18.890 --> 23:21.768
l am a senior field agent.
Danforth didn't hit a deer.

23:21.977 --> 23:25.397
He hit Ducky's John Doe.
Stick with me here.

23:25.647 --> 23:28.775
He's drunk, right? Wasted,
looking at five to ten for manslaughter.

23:28.984 --> 23:35.615
So he switches the John Doe
with his body, then skips town, right?

23:35.824 --> 23:38.785
Then he has his buddy Corporal Merrill
come along and torch the evidence.

23:38.994 --> 23:41.038
That's how it happened.
lt's pretty simple.

23:41.246 --> 23:44.791
lt's really just detective work,
connecting the dots.

23:45.500 --> 23:48.253
Hey, boss. l was just--
The director wanted-- She wanted--

23:48.503 --> 23:50.505
- With me.
- Okay.

24:12.903 --> 24:14.654
Dramatic,

24:14.863 --> 24:18.408
but duly noted, Agent Gibbs. l get it.

24:26.208 --> 24:28.293
- lt wasn't the way it looked, boss.
- l know.

24:28.543 --> 24:30.504
Director kind of suckered me
into that deal.

24:30.712 --> 24:32.339
- Ziva caved first.
- l didn't cave in.

24:32.547 --> 24:33.673
- l was trying--
- McGee next.

24:33.882 --> 24:35.258
Yeah, but, boss, it wasn't what it--

24:35.425 --> 24:38.428
And my loyal Saint Bernard
held out till last.

24:38.637 --> 24:41.181
- Well, l--
- Probably all of 30 seconds.

24:41.431 --> 24:45.185
So, what is my team--?
Can l call you my team?

24:45.394 --> 24:46.478
- Yes, of course.
- Yes, boss.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.814
- What are you gonna do now?
- Well, l think we should--

24:49.022 --> 24:51.316
- We could--
- Just solve the case!

24:51.566 --> 24:53.860
- Tony, you impound--
- lmpound Danforth's car.

24:54.069 --> 24:55.862
See if it hit anything
besides the tree.

24:56.071 --> 24:58.740
- Then you and McGee--
- Go to the original crash site.

24:58.949 --> 25:01.535
McGee, l want an agent standing by
Rebecca Crawford's room to get--

25:01.743 --> 25:04.037
A statement the second she wakes up,
boss. You got it.

25:04.913 --> 25:08.709
- And l'm with you, yes?
- l don't know, Ziva.

25:09.209 --> 25:12.587
- Are you?
- Definitely.

25:19.845 --> 25:22.806
The improvised explosive device,
gentlemen.

25:23.014 --> 25:26.601
The weapon of choice in lraq
and Afghanistan.

25:26.893 --> 25:29.896
Problem is spotting them
when they look something like this.

25:30.105 --> 25:33.191
Now, these are just a few of the lED
configurations l encountered

25:33.400 --> 25:34.985
on my last pump in lraq.

25:35.193 --> 25:37.612
Today, l'm gonna teach you
how to locate,

25:37.821 --> 25:41.241
disarm or, if need be,
blow them all in place.

25:42.576 --> 25:45.996
Corporal, you've got it. Take it over.
They're yours.

25:46.204 --> 25:49.332
Gentlemen, you heard Corporal Merrill.
Give me a huddle.

25:51.293 --> 25:53.128
Can l help you, sir?

25:53.378 --> 25:55.839
Did you know that lying
to a federal investigator is a crime?

25:56.423 --> 25:57.883
l didn't lie.

25:58.091 --> 26:00.010
What was the fight
in the Gold Monkey about?

26:02.095 --> 26:03.764
Billy was drunk, sir.

26:03.972 --> 26:08.268
l tried to take his car keys away
and he started swinging.

26:08.477 --> 26:11.146
l guess l didn't try hard enough.

26:11.313 --> 26:13.774
You told me you placed him
inside the car.

26:13.982 --> 26:15.192
l did.

26:15.400 --> 26:20.530
Billy must have made Becca pull over.
l should have--

26:20.739 --> 26:23.283
You should have taken him home
yourself.

26:23.492 --> 26:28.205
Yeah. Billy's dead because of me.

26:28.413 --> 26:29.539
Are you sure he's dead?

26:32.334 --> 26:34.795
The burned body
isn't Lance Corporal Danforth.

26:38.757 --> 26:41.093
Enough already. You know
l'm not the type to kiss and tell.

26:41.343 --> 26:43.845
Kiss? l heard from a reliable source

26:44.054 --> 26:47.140
that you were out with Agent Larsen
last night till about 2 a.m.

26:48.141 --> 26:49.184
Who told you that?

26:49.935 --> 26:53.980
l have information you want,
you have information l want.

26:54.231 --> 26:57.818
- Shall we dance?
- Forget it.

26:58.026 --> 27:00.153
Real men always kiss and tell.

27:03.156 --> 27:05.826
Okay, so, what are we looking for
that the cops didn't already find?

27:06.034 --> 27:07.494
They thought it was an accident.

27:07.703 --> 27:14.000
But they were not using the honed eye
of a highly trained federal agent.

27:16.545 --> 27:18.505
Probie, bring one of those numbers.

27:30.559 --> 27:33.395
- Prescription bottle of ibuprofen.
- Grunt candy, a Marine's best friend.

27:33.562 --> 27:35.647
Must have been thrown
from Danforth's car.

27:35.897 --> 27:39.192
- So?
- So it belonged to Corporal Merrill.

27:40.027 --> 27:41.028
And there's blood on it.

27:42.529 --> 27:45.824
- Come on. Say it.
- Say what?

27:46.074 --> 27:50.454
''You were right, Tony.''
You'll be the bigger woman for it.

27:50.620 --> 27:52.497
l'll just have to content myself
being the--

27:52.748 --> 27:55.959
- Well, the righter one.
- Woman?

27:56.752 --> 27:59.588
You know what l mean.
l found Merrill's scrip at the scene

27:59.755 --> 28:01.381
which means they were
in it together.

28:01.590 --> 28:05.218
And the DiNozzo body-swap theory
takes the lead.

28:05.427 --> 28:07.596
What if he dropped it
while killing Danforth?

28:07.804 --> 28:10.140
Abby found Danforth's blood
all over the windshield and hood.

28:10.348 --> 28:13.101
So much for your body-swap theory,
Tony.

28:13.727 --> 28:17.189
l've seen more than a few people
survive the windshield taste test, Ziva.

28:17.439 --> 28:20.400
Give it up, Tony. You said Merrill
was the Forrest Gump of explosives.

28:20.609 --> 28:23.070
Who else had the equipment and
expertise to blow up the ambulance?

28:23.278 --> 28:27.074
- Ziva's right. Bring him in.
- Feeling pretty smug, aren't you?

28:28.283 --> 28:31.119
Oh, yes, very.

28:36.833 --> 28:38.835
So, what's bugging
that famous gut now?

28:40.295 --> 28:42.964
Yes, you're that easy to read.

28:44.174 --> 28:47.260
l learned how to speak ''Gibbs''
a long time ago.

28:47.469 --> 28:49.596
- You going to Abby's lab or Autopsy?
- Abby's.

28:49.805 --> 28:51.098
Not to work my case.

28:51.348 --> 28:55.268
l have the right to dig into
any NClS investigation that l want to.

28:55.477 --> 28:59.940
Not mine, unless you want me
behind your desk again.

29:01.692 --> 29:03.151
Of course,

29:04.152 --> 29:06.697
you could just observe
and keep quiet.

29:07.656 --> 29:09.116
Fine.

29:11.827 --> 29:15.622
As you know, this is the only piece
of the trigger that l found.

29:20.085 --> 29:21.461
l'm not really here.

29:21.628 --> 29:23.004
Do you know how long
l've been waiting

29:23.171 --> 29:24.715
to cross over
into an alternate dimension?

29:24.923 --> 29:28.093
Well, you're still here, Abs, for now.
What is this?

29:28.343 --> 29:30.429
That's laminated-paper substrate,
boss,

29:30.637 --> 29:32.639
found in any number
of electronic devices.

29:32.848 --> 29:35.142
Unfortunately, l couldn't find a trace
of a single one.

29:35.350 --> 29:39.312
But then, l was surfing around
on my favourite origami web ring,

29:39.521 --> 29:40.981
and it hit me:

29:41.732 --> 29:44.985
Origami,
the ancient art of paper folding.

29:45.193 --> 29:47.863
Maybe the laminate substrate
was the trigger.

29:48.030 --> 29:49.990
You're telling me
Merrill folded himself a bomb?

29:50.198 --> 29:52.325
No, that's impossible.
lt came pre-folded.

29:52.534 --> 29:54.661
You see, several companies
have been exploring

29:55.370 --> 29:59.666
the use of paper circuit boards
for disposable products.

29:59.875 --> 30:01.960
Metallic ink is printed
on laminated paper

30:02.210 --> 30:03.837
and then folded
into the desired shape.

30:04.046 --> 30:07.007
l coated our burned substrate
with a metallic iron particulate.

30:07.215 --> 30:09.885
Which would attach to any
residual metallic ink still present.

30:10.177 --> 30:11.845
And then l ran the whole thing
through an x-ray

30:12.054 --> 30:14.514
to pick up on any latent patterns.

30:15.432 --> 30:18.518
Voila. You're looking at
a partial circuit board

30:18.727 --> 30:20.353
for a disposable cell phone.

30:20.520 --> 30:21.897
Any chance we could read the--?

30:23.690 --> 30:25.901
Any chance we could read the--

30:28.362 --> 30:29.905
Call log.

30:30.072 --> 30:31.698
--call logs?

30:31.907 --> 30:35.827
l'd have a better chance of getting
McGee to wear a Speedo to church.

30:36.411 --> 30:37.704
But l was able to pull a list

30:37.913 --> 30:40.832
of all the incoming calls
to the hospital's cell zone.

30:41.083 --> 30:43.835
Only three came in
immediately prior to the explosion.

30:44.419 --> 30:48.048
One of them was the triggering call,
Corporal Kenneth Merrill.

31:00.602 --> 31:02.396
- l appreciate you meeting me, Bill.
- Sure.

31:02.604 --> 31:05.440
- How's she doing?
- She's stable. Still in a coma.

31:05.607 --> 31:07.734
Are you waiting to question her?

31:08.944 --> 31:11.780
Listen, the fire wasn't an accident.

31:12.614 --> 31:15.075
How well do you know
Corporal Kenneth Merrill?

31:15.283 --> 31:18.495
Kenny? He's like a son to me.

31:18.704 --> 31:19.788
- lt wasn't an accident?
- No.

31:19.996 --> 31:22.165
The van was rigged to explode.

31:22.374 --> 31:24.209
Because Kenny defused lEDs
in lraq,

31:24.418 --> 31:26.712
you think he had something
to do with this?

31:26.920 --> 31:29.297
No. lmpossible.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.759
Mother told me that Rebecca
used to be Kenny's girlfriend.

31:33.009 --> 31:34.094
When they were children.

31:34.302 --> 31:36.221
They've been best friends
since elementary school.

31:36.471 --> 31:39.307
Night of your son's accident,
he was also in a fight.

31:41.143 --> 31:45.272
My son liked to drink,
sometimes in excess.

31:45.939 --> 31:49.151
Kenny was just trying to stop him
from driving home drunk.

31:49.359 --> 31:51.820
Kenny had nothing to do with this,
Jethro.

31:53.989 --> 31:56.283
lt looks like the call
that triggered the fire

31:56.491 --> 31:57.951
came from Kenny's cell phone.

31:59.119 --> 32:00.245
What time was that?

32:00.495 --> 32:02.998
- 0900 about.
- No, wasn't Kenny.

32:03.206 --> 32:05.542
He was with my wife and l from--

32:05.751 --> 32:10.464
l don't know, since before dawn
up until at least noon.

32:11.631 --> 32:12.632
Yeah, Gibbs.

32:12.841 --> 32:14.676
<i>Hey, boss,
Corporal Merrill's disappeared.</i>

32:18.096 --> 32:21.266
- Was that about my son?
- No. Corporal Merrill.

32:22.017 --> 32:25.645
After l questioned him, he walked
out of the class he was teaching.

32:26.355 --> 32:27.814
No one's seen him since.

32:52.046 --> 32:55.133
l don't recall ordering room service.

32:58.595 --> 33:01.055
ls that steak au poivre?

33:02.015 --> 33:04.225
And frisйe salad?

33:09.981 --> 33:11.816
You know, the last time
we had steak au poivre,

33:12.066 --> 33:13.776
six people died.

33:15.486 --> 33:17.739
What is this meal gonna cost me?

33:17.989 --> 33:22.452
Can't a guy just sit down
and have a bite with his old partner?

33:22.660 --> 33:26.289
Old partner?
Must be worse than l thought.

33:35.131 --> 33:37.342
How'd it go with Danforth
at the hospital today?

33:37.592 --> 33:41.304
lt went okay,
if you're Corporal Merrill.

33:41.512 --> 33:45.350
Danforth gave an alibi
for the day of the explosion.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.354
l assume you didn't believe him.

33:51.022 --> 33:52.815
Why is that?

33:52.982 --> 33:55.902
Because l wouldn't be eating
steak au poivre right now if you did.

33:59.030 --> 34:02.659
lf Danforth's covering for Merrill,

34:03.743 --> 34:06.496
he has to believe
Merrill didn't kill his son.

34:06.704 --> 34:08.331
The only way he can know that
for sure is--

34:08.498 --> 34:09.958
lf the kid is still alive.

34:13.253 --> 34:15.547
But you don't believe that either.

34:18.091 --> 34:20.635
The alibi was B.S.

34:21.469 --> 34:22.637
The grief was real.

34:24.179 --> 34:25.848
You sure
Danforth wasn't playing you?

34:27.183 --> 34:31.020
Sorry. That still doesn't mean
the son's dead.

34:31.938 --> 34:35.190
There was an accident.
He could be hurt.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.777
Could be recovering
in a private hospital somewhere.

34:38.027 --> 34:40.154
Wouldn't be the first time
a parent with means

34:40.362 --> 34:43.116
used them to keep a child
out of trouble.

34:44.242 --> 34:46.327
- You gonna eat that aspara--?
- Hey.

34:51.541 --> 34:53.418
Thank you.

34:55.378 --> 34:57.463
There is another possibility.

34:58.506 --> 35:01.175
lf Danforth is grieving for his son,

35:02.093 --> 35:04.470
then he's only covering
for Merrill because--

35:04.679 --> 35:07.515
He refuses to believe
that Merrill attempted to kill him.

35:10.935 --> 35:12.312
Let's hope he's not wrong.

35:14.647 --> 35:17.859
Either way, however it went down,

35:18.067 --> 35:22.197
Jethro, you find Merrill,
and you'll find Danforth Jr.

35:25.366 --> 35:28.203
<i>- Merrill, M-E-R-R--
- Say again?</i>

35:28.411 --> 35:30.413
R-R, like Ricky Ricardo.

35:30.622 --> 35:33.458
Okay, l got his ATM records,
checking for any recent activity.

35:33.666 --> 35:37.295
Vehicle is a tan Sierra,
license plate DPH--

35:37.503 --> 35:39.672
<i>Ricky Ricardo, you know,
from l Love Lucy.</i>

35:39.881 --> 35:42.425
No withdrawals in the last two weeks.
Credit-card records coming up.

35:42.634 --> 35:45.470
Tan. lf l meant burnt umber,
l would have said burnt umber.

35:45.637 --> 35:47.013
Get-- Whatever it is.

35:47.180 --> 35:50.558
Ricky Ricardo, you know,
''You got some explaining to do, Lucy.''

35:50.767 --> 35:51.809
<i>Yeah, whatever. Okay.</i>

35:52.018 --> 35:53.811
Hey, boss.
Just updating the BOLO on Merrill.

35:54.020 --> 35:56.773
And checking the DMV to see if
he's had any traffic violations recently.

35:56.981 --> 35:59.317
Going through his financial records
to try and pick up any leads

35:59.526 --> 36:00.568
off any recent purchases.

36:02.111 --> 36:05.198
- And?
- And we can't find him.

36:07.158 --> 36:08.868
But we're not gonna give up
until we do.

36:09.118 --> 36:10.912
Or die trying.

36:17.418 --> 36:20.088
Or die trying?
You had to put that in his head?

36:23.883 --> 36:25.051
You wanted to see me, Duck?

36:25.301 --> 36:27.178
Yes, l did.
l was just about to call you.

36:27.887 --> 36:31.474
Small wonder DiNozzo is always
looking over his shoulder.

36:31.683 --> 36:34.227
l managed to put a couple of bits
together.

36:34.477 --> 36:36.896
- His lower canine.
- How long?

36:37.146 --> 36:39.107
Oh, a week, maybe longer.

36:39.357 --> 36:41.484
What are the odds
of this reconstruction getting us an lD?

36:41.693 --> 36:42.819
Exceedingly long,

36:43.027 --> 36:47.407
but it's the only method l have
for identifying these remains.

36:47.574 --> 36:48.950
Well, l've had long shots come in.

36:49.158 --> 36:53.121
l once wagered a 500-to-1
on the lrish sweepstakes.

36:53.371 --> 36:55.874
He fell at the first jump,
but then recovered.

36:56.124 --> 36:58.334
He fell at the second jump.

36:58.585 --> 37:00.837
You'll never guess
what happened next.

37:03.965 --> 37:06.926
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- lt's me, Gibbs.

37:07.176 --> 37:10.680
You'll never guess what l found.
Come on, Gibbs, guess.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.976
l ran the prints
from the bottle of ibuprofen

37:15.185 --> 37:17.854
that Tony found
at the Danforth accident site.

37:18.563 --> 37:20.648
Can l at least get a drumroll?

37:23.026 --> 37:24.986
- Pathetic.
- Prints?

37:25.236 --> 37:27.405
The prescription belonged
to Corporal Merrill.

37:27.655 --> 37:31.075
All of the prints on the bottle belonged
to Lance Corporal Danforth.

37:31.326 --> 37:34.454
So? Merrill gave Danforth
some of his grunt candy.

37:34.704 --> 37:37.957
lt wasn't grunt candy.
The bottle was empty.

37:38.208 --> 37:40.710
So l swabbed it
and l ran it through the mass spec.

37:42.086 --> 37:45.632
- Cyclosporine, azathioprine.
- Come on, Abs, in English.

37:45.882 --> 37:47.675
They're antirejection drugs, Gibbs.

37:47.842 --> 37:50.720
lf Danforth was taking them,
he's had a transplant.

37:50.929 --> 37:52.931
The DNA l ran
could be from a donor organ.

37:54.515 --> 37:56.309
Kind of turning me on.

37:56.935 --> 37:58.895
l'm gonna get another sample
from Ducky.

37:59.145 --> 38:03.107
This body could be
Lance Corporal Danforth.

38:05.026 --> 38:06.653
So urban myth.

38:06.861 --> 38:09.072
There you go. Thanks.

38:13.117 --> 38:16.246
Hey, Bill. Called your home,
wife said you were here.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.709
You got bad news for me,
don't you?

38:26.548 --> 38:27.674
Yeah.

38:36.099 --> 38:38.309
Where'd your son
have his transplant?

38:43.898 --> 38:45.441
Does it matter?

38:50.446 --> 38:51.906
No.

38:54.450 --> 38:56.703
You can't stay in the corps
with a kidney transplant, Jethro.

38:56.953 --> 38:59.706
Who burned in the fire, Bill?

39:02.292 --> 39:03.918
An unclaimed body
at the hospital morgue

39:04.168 --> 39:06.296
scheduled for cremation.

39:07.922 --> 39:10.049
l made a donation,
they switched a toe tag,

39:10.300 --> 39:12.719
and the county saved itself
the cost of a cremation.

39:12.969 --> 39:15.346
- lt could have killed those EMTs, Bill.
- No.

39:16.472 --> 39:18.808
l didn't detonate that oxygen
until they were clear.

39:19.017 --> 39:22.854
Why? Your son was dead.

39:23.062 --> 39:25.648
Corps doesn't care
if he had a transplant now.

39:30.278 --> 39:34.657
They were more than friends.
They were a match.

39:34.866 --> 39:37.535
Corporal Merrill gave your son
a kidney.

39:38.161 --> 39:40.205
An autopsy would reveal
the transplant.

39:40.455 --> 39:44.584
l was afraid that the ME would run
a DNA check on the donor organ.

39:44.792 --> 39:49.422
And you can't be on active duty
if you gave away a kidney.

39:50.632 --> 39:53.009
The corps means the world
to that boy, Jethro.

39:53.218 --> 39:55.803
lt's his life.
And he risked everything.

39:56.012 --> 39:59.599
He risked it all to help out
his best friend, my son.

39:59.849 --> 40:01.976
- He rigged an lED to burn--
- l did that.

40:02.227 --> 40:04.020
- Bill.
- l'll swear l did it.

40:04.229 --> 40:06.189
- Kenny had nothing to do with this.
- Why'd he go UA?

40:06.397 --> 40:09.692
He didn't go UA,
he was at my place.

40:10.735 --> 40:13.112
The things that Kenny's teaching
those Marines going to lraq

40:13.321 --> 40:15.323
will save their lives, Jethro.

40:16.616 --> 40:19.452
Come on, let me take the hit
on this one.

40:22.288 --> 40:24.332
Where is your son's body?

40:31.923 --> 40:34.092
At the hospital morgue.

40:39.305 --> 40:40.848
Come on.

40:46.312 --> 40:50.942
l do apologize.
Usually one scraping is sufficient,

40:51.192 --> 40:55.405
but you are so crispy.

40:57.240 --> 41:00.243
That should satisfy Abby.

41:00.451 --> 41:04.163
Jethro, Abby told me
about the transplant and her theory.

41:04.914 --> 41:09.168
- Well, do you buy it?
- Well, it is possible.

41:09.419 --> 41:12.922
My money's on your teeth, Duck.
Get back to it.

41:13.172 --> 41:15.341
As soon as l give this to Abby.

41:16.301 --> 41:18.136
- l'll do it.
- Jethro.

41:18.970 --> 41:21.890
l've never seen you
break evidence protocol before.

41:23.182 --> 41:24.809
You don't trust me, Duck?

41:25.059 --> 41:28.021
Well, that's not the point.
Chain of evidence is chain of evidence.

41:28.229 --> 41:32.525
You're right about that.
l'd slap DiNozzo silly if he did it.

41:32.734 --> 41:35.153
Jethro, you surprise me.

41:35.820 --> 41:38.156
Must be getting old.

41:57.759 --> 41:59.469
God.

42:02.013 --> 42:04.057
Yes! Yes!

42:04.724 --> 42:06.309
- Yes!
- That is incredible.

42:07.602 --> 42:08.811
No need for a dental match now.

42:09.062 --> 42:15.026
The odds on getting donor DNA
from Danforth's body are astronomical.

42:15.276 --> 42:21.074
Alabama, 1 954, a 9-pound meteorite
hits Annie Hodges.

42:21.282 --> 42:25.495
The odds of getting hit by a meteorite,
astronomical-- No pun intended.

42:25.662 --> 42:29.165
--but it happens. And l'm gonna
be published again. Yes.

42:29.374 --> 42:31.042
Peachy for you,
but we just lost our victim.

42:31.251 --> 42:32.710
- Our suspect.
- Our theories.

42:32.877 --> 42:37.590
We've been barking up the wrong tree
the entire investigation.

42:37.799 --> 42:39.342
- Bush.
- Sorry, bush.

42:39.509 --> 42:43.721
We've been barking up
the wrong bush.

42:44.305 --> 42:47.725
Tree. So who torched the ambulance
and why?

42:49.269 --> 42:50.895
Don't look at me.

42:54.858 --> 42:57.193
- Don't tell me.
- Well, yeah.

42:57.443 --> 43:00.029
Abby was right.
The first test picked up donor DNA.

43:00.238 --> 43:02.907
Our John Doe
is Lance Corporal Danforth.

43:03.074 --> 43:07.370
Good. l mean, not good,
a Marine is dead,

43:07.579 --> 43:10.331
but good that the case
is no longer ours.

43:10.540 --> 43:13.376
l know what you're gonna say,
Jethro, and don't.

43:13.585 --> 43:16.337
l want Lance Corporal Danforth's
remains returned to his father

43:16.504 --> 43:19.549
and l want the case turned over
to the Maryland Arson lnvestigators.

43:19.757 --> 43:23.011
That will make Mr. Danforth happy,
which will make the SECNAV happy,

43:23.219 --> 43:25.013
which, in turn,
will make me very happy.

43:25.221 --> 43:28.308
We have wasted way too many
of our resources already.

43:28.933 --> 43:30.727
Okay.
