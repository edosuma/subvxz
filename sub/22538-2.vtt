00:25.000 --> 00:25.432
What's all this?

00:27.533 --> 00:29.741
I'm just trying to make sense
of what's happening to me.

00:30.732 --> 00:32.998
The way i figure,
i'm in a coma somewhere

00:32.999 --> 00:35.152
Or on a very intense
drug trip.

00:35.366 --> 00:36.931
Maybe i've traveled
through time,

00:36.932 --> 00:39.031
Or perhaps i've, uh,
crash-landed on an alien planet,

00:39.032 --> 00:41.065
And as we speak,

00:41.066 --> 00:43.625
Extraterrestrials are trying
to harvest my intellect-

00:44.266 --> 00:45.900
I mean, such as it is.

00:46.632 --> 00:48.271
Maybe i'm the victim
of a mind experiment,

00:48.300 --> 00:51.132
Or maybe i've died
and gone to heaven... or hell.

00:51.233 --> 00:53.820
How about purgatory?
or maybe...

00:55.041 --> 00:56.690
I've plain gone insane

00:56.691 --> 00:58.522
'Cause i don't know
what's real anymore.

00:58.608 --> 00:59.806
What's this supposed
to mean?

01:00.207 --> 01:01.867
That represents
the unknown.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.353
All things
i haven't thought of yet.

01:06.388 --> 01:08.751
It's the one out of all these
that scares me the most.

01:13.304 --> 01:15.302
Hey.
-This is for your own good.

01:15.488 --> 01:16.609
If the lieutenant sees this,

01:16.610 --> 01:18.630
You'll wish you could
go back in time.

01:23.537 --> 01:25.135
I can't see her face-

01:26.612 --> 01:28.853
Maya,
My girlfriend in 2008.

01:29.728 --> 01:32.645
I spent all last night
trying to picture her smile.

01:33.346 --> 01:35.557
I couldn't do it
no matter how hard i tried.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.930
So maybe if i can
figure all this out...

01:40.931 --> 01:44.024
Sam, no more
of this crazy talk.

01:44.198 --> 01:46.097
I'm trying to be
a friend to you, but-

01:46.098 --> 01:47.240
Okay, fair enough.

01:48.210 --> 01:50.743
What i'm doing in 1973
and how to get back-

01:50.744 --> 01:52.092
I'll figure it out
on my own.

01:52.111 --> 01:55.725
But until then, i guess i'm left with
only one option. and what's that, Sam?

01:56.287 --> 01:58.732
To spend my time here
doing what it is i do best.

01:58.953 --> 01:59.320
Which is?

02:01.137 --> 02:02.540
Catching bad guys.

02:40.573 --> 02:41.798
What's the big hurry, Trent?

02:41.957 --> 02:43.372
We just want to talk to you
about an armed robbery.

02:43.381 --> 02:43.741
You run like that,

02:43.741 --> 02:46.270
We'll begin to think you're
guilty of something, huh?

02:51.133 --> 02:51.633
Oops.

02:51.767 --> 02:53.292
Please, help me! help!

02:53.433 --> 02:56.184
What did you do that for?
for making me run.

02:56.185 --> 02:58.617
It's all right. he's dressed
for a dip. i can't swim!

02:58.618 --> 03:02.368
Isn't this a predicament? nah,
not really. Scum bums float.

03:02.647 --> 03:04.612
Please! help!

03:04.933 --> 03:08.864
All right. oh, come on. you can't
be serious. who are you working

03:08.864 --> 03:10.812
The check cashing robberies
with, trent?

03:10.813 --> 03:14.427
I don't know anything! you could
tell it to us, or you could tell it

03:14.428 --> 03:16.348
To the little fishies
at the bottom of the lake.

03:20.194 --> 03:21.299
Bye-bye.

03:23.289 --> 03:25.940
Uh, i don't think
he's gonna come up, guys.

03:26.155 --> 03:27.055
Can't let him drown.

03:27.873 --> 03:29.165
All right.
get him out, Chris.

03:29.906 --> 03:31.038
Oh, I can't swim.

03:31.323 --> 03:32.273
Ray?

03:32.274 --> 03:34.332
Nah, i took some lessons
when i was a kid.

03:34.333 --> 03:35.360
They didn't stick.

03:35.832 --> 03:38.355
Unbelievable. Chris?

03:49.859 --> 03:51.086
Hooray!

03:53.343 --> 03:53.893
Come on.

03:58.987 --> 04:02.138
All right, just breath.
you'll be fine.

04:02.139 --> 04:02.914
Just breath!

04:05.240 --> 04:07.088
What's the hurry,
Mark Spitz?

04:07.088 --> 04:07.995
Uhh!

04:08.217 --> 04:10.414
Hey, get this guy
out of here.

04:20.142 --> 04:21.204
I miss you, Maya.

04:24.243 --> 04:25.445
You okay, Sam?

04:26.343 --> 04:28.342
He looks like one of them
cartoon characters,

04:28.343 --> 04:29.991
Got hit over the head
with a frying pan.

04:30.844 --> 04:32.979
Don't he, loot? yeah, he
does! like in the funny papers.

04:33.143 --> 04:34.355
Like in the funny papers.

04:36.468 --> 04:39.801
Yeah,
like in the funny papers.

04:43.133 --> 04:44.579
<i>My name is Sam Tyler.</i>

04:44.633 --> 04:47.973
<i>I was in an accident,
And wake up in 1973.</i>

04:48.499 --> 04:50.604
<i>I don't know how or why
I'm here,</i>

04:51.033 --> 04:52.607
<i>But whatever has happened,</i>

04:52.617 --> 04:54.612
<i>It's like I've landed 
on a different planet.</i>

04:54.816 --> 04:58.358
<i>Now if I can work out
the reason, I can get home.</i>

05:06.498 --> 05:09.880
Last week, three triple "A" money
check cashing stores

05:09.881 --> 05:10.688
Were robbed.

05:11.615 --> 05:13.424
A little over $12,000
taken.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.281
Oh, a tasty haul.

05:16.104 --> 05:18.084
And best of luck to 'em,
whoever they are.

05:18.137 --> 05:20.477
Three bodies were found,
one at each store-

05:21.936 --> 05:22.565
Penny Driscoll.

05:22.566 --> 05:24.051
Hey, looks like
she was cute...

05:24.349 --> 05:26.053
Before she put on
the dead chick mask.

05:27.655 --> 05:30.355
Alonzo de Souza
and Dennis Maguire.

05:30.588 --> 05:32.831
All shot,
and that's no small thing

05:32.831 --> 05:35.930
Considering they were tucked
snug behind bulletproof glass

05:35.931 --> 05:38.122
With no witnesses,
no sign of forced entry.

05:38.123 --> 05:39.691
Yeah, that's, uh,
that's very cool.

05:39.692 --> 05:42.510
Hey, listen, any chance I'm
gonna get sprung anytime soon?

05:42.589 --> 05:44.293
You know, "laugh-in"
is on tonight, and...

05:44.989 --> 05:47.455
I got it bad
for that goldie hawn.

05:47.456 --> 05:48.824
We know you're involved,
Trent.

05:49.639 --> 05:51.597
No one loves hitting
check cashing stores

05:51.598 --> 05:53.299
Like you
and your monkey squad.

05:53.415 --> 05:56.584
So who were you meetin' at the
pool? i was meetin' my aunt Doris.

05:56.902 --> 05:59.435
You know, you're just her type.
no, seriously.

05:59.469 --> 06:02.270
I should give her your number.
you could be my uncle Gene.

06:02.395 --> 06:03.435
Uncle Gene

06:03.436 --> 06:05.725
Hey, that'd be perfect.

06:05.726 --> 06:07.378
Why don't we practice?

06:11.042 --> 06:13.603
Say it, you filthy scrote.
Aah!

06:13.833 --> 06:15.208
You want me to stop?
Say it.

06:17.832 --> 06:19.525
Aah! uncle! uncle!

06:19.599 --> 06:21.345
uncle! uncle.

06:21.867 --> 06:22.662
Not bad.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.921
What is someone who can't swim
doing at lasker pool, Trent?

06:25.967 --> 06:27.597
Well, it's never too late
to start.

06:28.968 --> 06:31.428
Learning the backstroke
ain't a crime, is it?

06:31.734 --> 06:33.836
We found this on you
when we pulled you in.

06:34.570 --> 06:37.136
Could this be your cut
of the tiple "A" money jobs?

06:37.237 --> 06:39.937
Or you just need a little
padding in your swim trunks?

06:42.949 --> 06:44.128
Yeah, that ain't
my scrat.

06:45.049 --> 06:46.741
If it was,
wouldn't it be wet?

06:58.462 --> 06:59.247
You were saying?

07:06.429 --> 07:07.108
What is it, June?

07:07.109 --> 07:09.981
Assistant district attorney
crocker is here.

07:10.108 --> 07:13.020
Fine. throw this pile of pus
back in the cage.

07:13.191 --> 07:15.751
Oh, no, come on, man.
that cell smells like vomit.

07:15.791 --> 07:17.014
Oh, i can help you
with that.

07:23.708 --> 07:24.307
What was that?

07:25.375 --> 07:27.596
That money isn't from
the check cashing robberies.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.838
<i>Yeah, and Roe vs. Wade
ain't really two options</i>

07:29.839 --> 07:31.345
When you find yourself
in a river.

07:31.839 --> 07:34.261
What does that even mean?
That's an analogy.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.202
Uh, no,
I don't think it is.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.054
<i>It's like an analogy.</i>

07:37.055 --> 07:38.554
Where i come from,
what you did is called

07:38.555 --> 07:40.002
"Tampering
with physical evidence,"

07:40.003 --> 07:44.108
And it's a class "E" felony. where
you come from? where is that, Hyde?

07:44.508 --> 07:46.845
Where guns
are made of gingerbread,

07:47.007 --> 07:49.407
And criminals confess
for lollipops.

07:49.408 --> 07:51.712
Do you have any evidence
linking Trent to the robberies?

07:54.145 --> 07:56.473
Well, well, well.
Aren't you the eager beaver?

07:57.930 --> 07:59.264
<i>Now that was an analogy.</i>

08:00.105 --> 08:01.375
No, that was just
obnoxious.

08:01.376 --> 08:03.783
Ah, what's a guy gotta do to get
an analogy?

08:03.784 --> 08:04.603
If we have the evidence,

08:04.604 --> 08:10.004
We'd be able to charge him by now, right?
that's a lot of questions for a secretary.

08:10.005 --> 08:11.242
There he is-

08:12.004 --> 08:14.170
The golden retriever of
the district attorney's office.

08:15.289 --> 08:16.471
Thank you, No-Nuts.

08:17.822 --> 08:20.407
Lee, this is the transfer
from Hyde i told you about-

08:20.407 --> 08:21.197
Sam Tyler.

08:21.601 --> 08:22.890
Sam, this is Lee Crocker.

08:23.201 --> 08:25.598
Not only does he know
where all the bodies are buried,

08:25.652 --> 08:26.973
He knows the shovel sizes.

08:28.757 --> 08:30.084
Welcome aboard, Tyler.

08:32.347 --> 08:33.961
Like two peas in a pansy pod.

08:34.215 --> 08:36.763
Detective,
If ignorance was a drug,

08:36.864 --> 08:39.241
You'd be high all the time.

08:40.365 --> 08:41.753
<i>Now that was an analogy.</i>

08:43.099 --> 08:45.200
I took a look
at the file, Gene.

08:45.599 --> 08:47.498
The F.C.C.
has a better case

08:47.499 --> 08:50.098
Against George Carlin
and his seven dirty words

08:50.099 --> 08:52.024
Than you have
against Kim Trent.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.325
I agree.

08:54.749 --> 08:57.129
We have no evidence
to secure a conviction.

08:58.182 --> 08:59.859
Give us a second, Lee.

09:00.048 --> 09:03.355
Detective Tyler and I
need a moment. Of course.

09:10.055 --> 09:11.101
You want evidence?

09:15.921 --> 09:17.157
Aladdin's cave.

09:17.487 --> 09:18.597
What the hell is that?

09:18.621 --> 09:21.960
There's 300 microdots
of L.S.D. here.

09:22.530 --> 09:24.223
We plant 'em on Kim Trent

09:24.263 --> 09:27.030
And watch him grow into
a big flower of justice.

09:28.930 --> 09:30.429
That's just...

09:30.730 --> 09:31.737
Great.

09:31.847 --> 09:35.319
I detect sarcasm. How would you
do it where you come from?

09:35.911 --> 09:37.626
We wouldn't have pulled him in
without evidence.

09:37.627 --> 09:41.438
eEven if you knew there were people out there
in real danger? people are always in danger .

09:41.589 --> 09:43.787
One minute, you're going about
your business. the next...

09:43.788 --> 09:45.692
bang! you're taken out
by a speeding car.

09:45.705 --> 09:48.252
Well, I'm taking a speeding car
off the road.

09:49.431 --> 09:50.426
So what do you wanna do?

09:51.564 --> 09:53.716
We give him
a desk appearance ticket,

09:54.063 --> 09:56.223
We cut him loose,
but we stay on him.

09:56.531 --> 09:59.076
We follow him,
see where he takes us,

09:59.774 --> 10:01.851
Get some real evidence
so we can put him away for good.

10:01.857 --> 10:03.038
That's your big plan?

10:03.157 --> 10:04.891
Yeah, that's my big plan.

10:05.902 --> 10:06.524
Fine.

10:07.185 --> 10:08.027
Cut him loose.

10:10.990 --> 10:13.303
But whatever happens next
is on your head.

10:18.024 --> 10:19.538
You and Ray stay on Trent.

10:19.624 --> 10:22.323
Anywhere he goes, you guys go. Got it? 
-sure thing.

10:22.324 --> 10:23.474
We'll relieve you
in the morning.

10:23.574 --> 10:27.901
Okay. i don't know if Ray's
gonna go for that plan. why not?

10:27.902 --> 10:29.901
He doesn't really, uh-
He doesn't like me.

10:29.902 --> 10:31.020
No.
No, i know.

10:31.053 --> 10:33.686
No, the loot put him in
for a promotion to second grade,

10:33.687 --> 10:35.211
And then you show up.

10:35.236 --> 10:37.832
He-he just feels
like you took his spot.

10:37.936 --> 10:39.619
But i wouldn't take it personal. just
- Yeah, well,

10:39.620 --> 10:42.536
I didn't request this transfer.
It just happened.

10:43.680 --> 10:45.391
It's like Guantanamo bay
in here.

10:45.447 --> 10:47.567
Oh, I wouldn't know.
i've never been to Puerto Rico.

10:48.313 --> 10:51.110
Kim Trent, here is a D.A.T.
You are free to go.

10:51.714 --> 10:54.199
You gotta respect those
who defend the constitution.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.334
All hail
the Nixon administration.

10:57.647 --> 10:59.381
Yeah, don't get too attached.

11:15.014 --> 11:15.949
Are you okay, sir?
-Did you just see that?

11:15.950 --> 11:19.352
Was it a rat? the rats
are big in this house, sir,

11:19.502 --> 11:21.238
But they're harmless mostly.

11:21.846 --> 11:23.332
I cleaned out that cell.

11:23.846 --> 11:25.291
It smelled of vomit.

11:26.597 --> 11:29.135
<i>He was right.
It did stink to high heaven.</i>

11:30.131 --> 11:31.180
Well, I'm sure the, uh,

11:31.281 --> 11:33.550
The next prisoner
will appreciate your efforts.

11:35.290 --> 11:38.582
Tt's all love and light here
at the, uh, 1-2-5.

11:45.984 --> 11:48.488
<i>Other news,
in honor of mother's day,</i>

11:48.517 --> 11:50.275
<i>Elvis Presley will be
performing a special concert</i>

11:50.276 --> 11:52.275
<i>In Lake Tahoe
at the Tahoe Sahara</i>

11:52.276 --> 11:54.295
<i>In memory of his mother,
Gladys Presley-</i>

12:31.592 --> 12:32.142
Whoa.

12:32.225 --> 12:34.437
You must be 2B.
I'm Windy.

12:34.438 --> 12:37.242
Windy.
Now that's an unusual name.

12:37.271 --> 12:38.267
My fathenamed me Windy

12:38.268 --> 12:41.437
Because he was a sailor and
wind was his gold. I'm Sam.

12:42.715 --> 12:43.506
What?

12:43.614 --> 12:47.193
Hey, wow! your fate line-
It's bisected!

12:47.194 --> 12:50.523
Is that a good thing? It can
be. It's like a record skipping.

12:50.523 --> 12:52.379
You're listening to one song,
the needle gets bumped,

12:52.380 --> 12:54.445
And you're grooving
to a whole new tune.

12:54.630 --> 12:58.167
What's up there? well, um,
there-for starters, no naked women.

12:58.991 --> 13:00.887
Are you new to New York?
You could say that.

13:00.888 --> 13:02.190
It's an adjustment.

13:02.191 --> 13:05.591
I get homesick all the time
for Decorah, Iowa.

13:05.608 --> 13:07.781
Lot of people,
a lot of love back there.

13:08.008 --> 13:10.058
I know the feeling.
I used to spend hours

13:10.108 --> 13:12.274
Just floating in an inner tube,  
looking up at the clouds.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.374
You and me,
we stay in one place,

13:14.375 --> 13:17.208
But the clouds go everywhere.
So sometimes I'd ask them

13:17.209 --> 13:19.095
To carry a message
back to Decorah for me.

13:19.459 --> 13:21.623
I imagine there's someone
floating in a lake,

13:21.624 --> 13:25.151
Looking up at the same cloud,
sending me their love, too.

13:26.842 --> 13:29.992
Hey, do you like to dance?
because i love to dance!

13:30.043 --> 13:30.846
Not really.

13:30.847 --> 13:33.011
Oh, great.
Well, then we'll have to dance.

13:33.381 --> 13:33.897
Okay.

13:33.997 --> 13:35.427
I'll see you around, 2B.

13:39.064 --> 13:40.774
2-4-6 to central K,

13:40.863 --> 13:42.827
We are approaching
Trent's apartment.

13:48.698 --> 13:50.145
Where are Chris and Ray?

13:51.747 --> 13:53.229
2-4-6 to central K.

13:53.230 --> 13:54.825
Proceed, 2-4-6.

13:55.431 --> 13:56.981
We're outside
Kim Trent's apartment.

13:56.982 --> 13:58.914
Detectives Carling and Skelton
are not here.

13:59.298 --> 14:00.673
Please raise car 1-3-5

14:00.674 --> 14:03.787
And advise with their
location, K. 10-4, 2-4-6.

14:08.675 --> 14:10.761
So is this how
you do things in Hyde?

14:11.775 --> 14:13.234
You sit on your ass

14:13.235 --> 14:15.908
And watch known criminals
pick their noses.

14:16.085 --> 14:18.734
Actually, in Hyde,
we sit on our noses

14:18.735 --> 14:21.818
And watch known criminals pick their
asses. All units, we have a report

14:21.819 --> 14:24.500
Of a 10-22 disturbance
at triple "A" check cashing.

14:24.501 --> 14:25.265
Let's go.

14:30.302 --> 14:32.769
Still think it's Trent?
Actually...

14:35.368 --> 14:36.855
Hey, police!

14:38.036 --> 14:38.977
Take cover!

14:45.852 --> 14:46.660
Enough.

14:51.252 --> 14:52.487
I hit him.
good.

14:52.519 --> 14:54.766
You okay?
uh, yeah, I think so.

14:58.235 --> 14:58.885
June?

15:14.001 --> 15:15.004
She's gonna be okay.

15:16.001 --> 15:16.910
Pulse is normal.

15:17.668 --> 15:20.917
All right. The bleeding's
stopped. Excuse me.

15:20.918 --> 15:22.461
All right, let's get her.
Ready?

15:23.151 --> 15:23.906
Okay.

15:27.285 --> 15:28.371
She's gonna be okay.

15:28.584 --> 15:31.513
Got the door? yeah, come
on. let's go. Lock it down.

15:36.375 --> 15:37.993
All right.
All right, go ahead.

15:38.375 --> 15:39.952
Where were you guys?

15:40.108 --> 15:43.134
Loot, we got a radio message
to call into command.

15:43.259 --> 15:45.324
Now I figured it was you

15:45.325 --> 15:48.136
Shutting down Tyler's
brilliant surveillance scheme.

15:49.042 --> 15:51.592
Took us three blocks south
to find a pay phone.

15:52.042 --> 15:53.707
Found this radio
in June's car.

15:53.708 --> 15:55.399
She must've
heard the call go out

15:55.492 --> 15:57.522
And tried to be batgirl
or something.

15:58.829 --> 16:01.594
And Junie always had dreams
of doing something important

16:01.595 --> 16:02.628
At the department.

16:03.329 --> 16:05.896
I told her, "you're a twirl, know your place." 
-So she didn't.

16:06.746 --> 16:10.439
All right, I'm gonna canvass
the block, get some statements.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.393
Somebody must've
had eyeballs on this.

16:18.773 --> 16:20.365
This doesn't make any sense.

16:20.873 --> 16:23.753
Trent took a huge risk.
He knew we'd be on to him.

16:25.541 --> 16:26.899
There has to be a reason.

16:28.256 --> 16:30.633
I want this mess cleaned up.

16:34.557 --> 16:36.518
And I want you
to clear this away.

16:38.640 --> 16:41.186
I don't want any of her
left lying on the street.

16:41.691 --> 16:44.901
This is an active crime scene,
it still needs to be processed.

16:48.157 --> 16:51.111
Clean it up!
I want you to clean it up now!

16:51.140 --> 16:54.591
She works at the precinct.
She is family.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.529
And I want to be able
to look her dad in the eye

16:58.007 --> 16:59.627
And say you cleaned up

16:59.857 --> 17:02.228
Every drop
of her precious blood.

17:02.790 --> 17:05.980
Get off me! you can't
blame me, you lunatic!

17:06.123 --> 17:08.788
This is Trent's fault!
He pulled the trigger!

17:08.789 --> 17:13.054
You made sure there was a trigger
to pull! we had no evidence!

17:13.055 --> 17:14.344
Tell that to June!

17:14.955 --> 17:17.938
I give up. I give up!

17:19.123 --> 17:20.690
I'm sick of this cosmic joke

17:20.691 --> 17:22.512
That everyone
seems to be in on but me!

17:23.968 --> 17:24.663
I'm sick of it.

18:09.568 --> 18:10.308
Real.

18:13.868 --> 18:14.697
Unreal.

18:17.668 --> 18:18.334
Real.

18:21.968 --> 18:22.235
Unreal.

18:24.868 --> 18:26.044
Re-ow!

18:54.151 --> 18:56.567
You know, this neighborhood
has gone to the dogs.

18:56.601 --> 19:01.144
Mm-hmm, right.
That's, uh, an unusual ashtray.

19:01.318 --> 19:04.283
Yeah. My granddaughter sofia
made it for me.

19:04.284 --> 19:07.884
She loves to come over
and see all the butts in there.

19:07.985 --> 19:10.338
<i>She says, "Nonna uses it."</i>

19:10.768 --> 19:11.908
Beautiful story.

19:12.017 --> 19:13.769
Should write a letter
to the surgeon general.

19:14.068 --> 19:16.844
You know, if I squint,

19:16.867 --> 19:20.513
There's a little bit
of that... Steve Mcqueen?

19:24.773 --> 19:27.706
Um... look, you have
an unobstructed view

19:27.707 --> 19:29.606
Of triple "A" money from here,

19:29.607 --> 19:31.456
And judging from how much
you love your grandchild

19:31.457 --> 19:33.132
And... your cigarettes,

19:33.256 --> 19:35.982
I'm guessing you spend a lot
of time looking out that window.

19:36.373 --> 19:40.424
Sure, I saw what happened,
but aside from the shooting,

19:40.523 --> 19:43.455
There was nothing different
From any Tuesday or Thursday.

19:43.556 --> 19:47.245
You guys showed up,
escorting the man who got shot.

19:47.246 --> 19:48.082
"Us guys"?

19:48.379 --> 19:49.795
Yeah, the police.

19:50.047 --> 19:52.310
Policemen? in uniform?

19:52.413 --> 19:54.226
Policemen in uniform.

19:57.246 --> 19:59.064
you screwed up, you guys.

19:59.196 --> 20:01.198
<i>Real big-time, huh, Stevie?</i>

20:02.630 --> 20:03.271
I guess we did.

20:08.337 --> 20:11.348
"Astronauts in orbit
to repair ailing skylab."

20:12.103 --> 20:13.100
Hmm.

20:13.604 --> 20:15.770
And those hippies think they
know how to get high, Junie.

20:15.771 --> 20:18.067
Let's see what kind of trouble
dagwood's gettin' into today.

20:18.204 --> 20:21.824
Been looking for you, boss.
How's she doing?

20:33.537 --> 20:34.077
Same.

20:35.020 --> 20:35.973
Uhh! oh!

20:36.887 --> 20:39.487
Ah.
That felt good.

20:40.920 --> 20:41.434
Yeah?

20:42.354 --> 20:43.523
Then you're gonna
love this.

20:57.254 --> 20:58.322
AAH!

21:09.771 --> 21:12.454
I always liked June.

21:14.738 --> 21:17.833
Truth be told, she'd probably
make a good cop.

21:20.787 --> 21:24.057
I only know one way
to police.

21:26.570 --> 21:27.522
So do I.

21:30.103 --> 21:32.941
I'm not squeaky-clean,
and neither is this city.

21:34.021 --> 21:35.446
I love this city.

21:35.871 --> 21:39.494
It needs whoever it can get
to look after it. That's me.

21:40.904 --> 21:42.611
You're gonna
ma this right.

21:46.004 --> 21:46.303
Well...

21:48.603 --> 21:49.600
I found a witness

21:50.637 --> 21:53.136
Who saw two uniforms
escort Trent into the store.

21:53.137 --> 21:54.386
That's how
they gained access.

21:54.387 --> 21:57.401
Watch what you're saying, Tyler. 
-How can you...

21:57.437 --> 21:59.436
The keeper
of Aladdin's cave...

21:59.437 --> 22:00.986
Question the existence of dirty cops

22:00.987 --> 22:03.103
Just because, you know,
you don't like it?

22:03.487 --> 22:06.236
I'm not turing the spotlight
on my own department.

22:06.237 --> 22:08.754
No, you're just gonna
coerce testimony

22:08.754 --> 22:11.769
And set up suspects
just to close the case.

22:11.770 --> 22:13.069
Oh, you got somethin'
on your mouth there.

22:13.070 --> 22:13.856
Let me-let me see.

22:13.857 --> 22:17.190
Ah! what are you doin'?
hey, stop that! get off me!

22:17.191 --> 22:19.256
<i>Don't do-don't do that.
I'll do that.</i>

22:21.257 --> 22:21.963
Hey!

22:32.159 --> 22:33.287
Spaceman!

22:33.993 --> 22:36.259
Heard the boss gave you
a ride to pummel city.

22:38.259 --> 22:39.834
I need to talk with you,
Ray,

22:40.659 --> 22:41.892
About your moonlighting.

22:44.306 --> 22:45.143
Talk to me.

22:45.255 --> 22:48.084
Ain't like I'm the only one
moonlighting at the 1-2-5.

22:48.872 --> 22:49.760
Your named turned up

22:49.761 --> 22:52.432
On a list of cops
who work security for triple "A" money.

22:54.127 --> 22:55.261
Yeah.

22:55.794 --> 22:58.493
I make $300 and change a week
as a third grade detective.

22:58.494 --> 22:59.993
That's barely enough
to afford

22:59.994 --> 23:02.685
The clams arreganata
every friday night at guido's.

23:03.527 --> 23:04.997
So I work a little security

23:05.177 --> 23:07.279
When my money clip
runs a little light.

23:07.344 --> 23:08.321
What's the calamity?

23:09.678 --> 23:11.660
Well, Trent was
working with cops.

23:11.678 --> 23:13.551
Cops were moonlighting
as security.

23:14.177 --> 23:15.593
You have
firsthand knowledge.

23:17.545 --> 23:19.275
You took a powder
on the stakeout, right?

23:21.265 --> 23:22.354
So I'm coming to you.

23:23.265 --> 23:25.361
You coming to me 'cause
you think i might be complicit?

23:29.364 --> 23:31.732
It's the first I'm hearing
about cops being involved.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.360
Well, Hunt isn't with me
on this,

23:35.361 --> 23:38.626
But, uh, i got an eyewitness
that says so.

23:43.494 --> 23:44.833
You should talk to Crocker.

23:45.494 --> 23:47.546
The A.D.A.?
-If Hunt's stonewalling,

23:47.561 --> 23:49.435
You're gonna need a friend
on the outside.

23:52.661 --> 23:55.921
Why are you doing this for me,
going around hunt?

23:56.528 --> 23:58.569
Hunt was my hook
to second grade.

24:00.060 --> 24:02.185
For three years,
I carried his water.

24:03.595 --> 24:05.570
Lot of good that did me
when you showed up.

24:09.846 --> 24:11.795
Crocker's a little too
bucking-for-sainthood

24:11.796 --> 24:13.980
For my liking,
but he's a straight shooter.

24:14.279 --> 24:16.483
He'll know what to do.
Give him a try.

24:20.530 --> 24:23.222
And you think cops
from the 1-2-5 are involved?

24:23.280 --> 24:24.390
Well, I don't know.

24:24.981 --> 24:26.829
Hunt's made it hard
to get any traction,

24:26.830 --> 24:28.883
So that's why
I'm talking to you.

24:29.514 --> 24:31.784
I'll have one of
my investigators look into it.

24:31.913 --> 24:33.651
Should take
some of the pressure off.

24:34.881 --> 24:37.156
I appreciate the help,
not to mention your discretion.

24:38.081 --> 24:38.626
Of course.

24:38.930 --> 24:41.497
Heck of a way to introduce
yourself to a new house.

24:46.531 --> 24:48.194
You don't know
the half of it.

25:17.064 --> 25:17.885
<i>Maya? Maya?</i>

25:17.886 --> 25:20.879
<i>You in here?</i>

25:21.851 --> 25:24.519
<i>Boo! </i>

25:25.768 --> 25:26.617
<i>I'll remember that</i>

25:26.618 --> 25:29.169
<i>Next time you want me to work
a uniform detail for you.</i>

25:29.917 --> 25:31.883
<i>Who says "Boo"
in this day and age?</i>

25:31.984 --> 25:33.607
<i>You're like
a cartoon character</i>

25:33.608 --> 25:37.527
<i>From the funny papers. Who says
"Funny papers"in this day and age?</i>

25:37.727 --> 25:39.543
<i>Like in the funny papers.</i>

25:40.861 --> 25:44.000
<i>Light some candels,
Run a bath.</i>

25:44.100 --> 25:45.366
<i>I miss you , Maya.</i>

25:45.383 --> 25:48.082
<i>No internet, no dvd,
no video games...</i>

25:48.083 --> 25:50.494
<i>Oh, but I don't want to live
in a world without video games.</i>

25:51.300 --> 25:52.882
<i>You're kinda
killing the mood.</i>

26:13.738 --> 26:14.619
Hey, 2B!

26:15.404 --> 26:17.537
Hey.
I whipped up a tray

26:17.538 --> 26:20.842
Of "welcome to the second floor"
lasagna for you.

26:21.572 --> 26:23.890
Well, that's,
Uh, very nice of you.

26:23.921 --> 26:26.654
What's nice is
I'm about to introduce you

26:26.655 --> 26:30.337
To the most luxurious lasagna
you've ever tasted.

26:30.338 --> 26:32.351
Not to toot my own horn-
It's my mom's recipe-

26:32.388 --> 26:34.487
But it's guaranteed
to cure what ails you.

26:34.638 --> 26:36.804
That jerk you brought home
last night stole your watch?

26:36.805 --> 26:38.804
Just have a slice
of mom's lasagna.

26:38.805 --> 26:40.397
The war in Vietnam
got you down?

26:40.398 --> 26:42.952
Just taste
that smooth ricotta cheese.

26:43.567 --> 26:44.574
How you doing today?

26:45.035 --> 26:46.883
Like some mom's lasagna
will hit the spot.

26:46.884 --> 26:48.710
Hooray. It's a garden mix.

26:49.218 --> 26:51.883
There's fresh tomatoes,
zucchini, carrots,

26:52.034 --> 26:54.593
Peas, plenty of herbs,

26:54.594 --> 27:00.048
And i add a healthy sprinkling
of Mary Jane's magic earth.

27:01.347 --> 27:02.795
Mary Jane's magic earth?

27:02.830 --> 27:04.492
No recipe is complete
without it.

27:07.164 --> 27:08.069
There's Marijuana in here?

27:08.070 --> 27:10.535
It's mellow,
nothing like the blue de hue

27:10.536 --> 27:13.802
I had at my friend Randy's
pig roast. You know i'm a cop.

27:14.053 --> 27:16.492
<i>Then you must get
the really good stuff.</i>

27:18.751 --> 27:21.626
Um, there's something
I've been meaning to ask.

27:22.720 --> 27:26.305
What you said the other day
about sending messages

27:26.337 --> 27:28.297
Back to loved ones
through the clouds...

27:28.470 --> 27:29.276
Yeah?

27:30.103 --> 27:30.437
Well...

27:32.804 --> 27:34.643
Do the clouds ever respond?

27:35.721 --> 27:36.368
Nope.

27:37.187 --> 27:40.203
It's just a one-way thing.
I never hear from the clouds.

27:40.204 --> 27:43.496
But the stars-
they won't shut up.

27:43.646 --> 27:46.178
My mom, my dad,
my brother Gregory,

27:46.179 --> 27:47.313
My best friend Lolly-

27:47.314 --> 27:50.017
They all send their love to me
through the stars.

27:51.135 --> 27:54.700
Because the stars speak
for the lonely, blue hearts,

27:54.701 --> 27:56.780
And lonely, blue hearts
tell the truth.

27:58.793 --> 27:59.904
I gotta run.

28:00.110 --> 28:01.213
Enjoy the las'.

28:02.110 --> 28:03.816
And don't forget,
we still gotta dance.

28:04.510 --> 28:06.640
As they say in New Orleans...

28:07.910 --> 28:08.754
Bayou.

28:23.277 --> 28:24.730
There he is, fellas.

28:27.660 --> 28:29.053
Great.

28:29.060 --> 28:30.142
Ahem.

28:31.527 --> 28:33.330
There he is.

28:34.487 --> 28:36.425
We should string him up
from the rafters

28:36.426 --> 28:38.047
By his sneaky little rat-tail.

28:39.525 --> 28:40.562
What's going on?

28:40.626 --> 28:44.158
What's going on?
look at him play possum now.

28:44.359 --> 28:47.478
Rats, possums... what did I
tell you about analogies, Ray?

28:48.092 --> 28:50.159
The Loot just got off
the phone with Crocker.

28:54.726 --> 28:55.912
Oh, yeah.

28:58.226 --> 28:59.509
Wow.

29:01.492 --> 29:03.993
Nice work, Tyler.
Yeah, way to go, buddy.

29:05.456 --> 29:06.478
Unbelievable, huh?

29:09.986 --> 29:12.714
Did you really think
it wouldn't get back to me?

29:13.919 --> 29:15.598
Good luck.
Yeah, tell me about it.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.784
Listen, bob,
did you get my e-mail?

29:20.960 --> 29:22.750
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
It's right here.

29:23.394 --> 29:23.661
Real.

29:31.361 --> 29:32.501
Unreal.

29:37.394 --> 29:38.194
Real.

29:38.893 --> 29:40.513
Print it out, would ya?

29:45.094 --> 29:46.048
Unreal.

30:01.761 --> 30:03.652
Sam, June's awake.

30:04.294 --> 30:04.963
Are you okay?

30:06.260 --> 30:09.028
They're not real.
What are you talking about?

30:09.694 --> 30:12.510
The reason why I can't track
down the cops working with Trent

30:12.511 --> 30:14.084
Isn't because
Hunt's been stonewalling.

30:14.085 --> 30:16.951
It's because they don't exist.
Sam, you're not making any sense.

30:16.952 --> 30:19.771
The cops from
the check cashing robberies-

30:20.297 --> 30:21.445
They're impersonators.

30:22.351 --> 30:23.369
Impersonators?

30:24.616 --> 30:26.675
They're not real cops.

30:28.783 --> 30:30.347
So the sawbones says

30:30.348 --> 30:33.564
You're gonna be
right as rain in no time. Okay?

30:33.565 --> 30:34.391
Yeah.

30:35.067 --> 30:36.821
I'm still not clear
what happened.

30:37.817 --> 30:41.714
What happened was I took care of
the guy that did this to you,

30:42.050 --> 30:43.232
Shot him dead.

30:44.983 --> 30:45.586
Who?

30:46.683 --> 30:47.798
Kim Trent.

30:54.551 --> 30:56.230
Did you know Kim Trent?

30:56.617 --> 30:59.249
No. But you cleaned his cell of vomit.

30:59.250 --> 31:00.284
Remember?

31:02.117 --> 31:04.635
What were you doing
outside triple "A" money, June?

31:04.650 --> 31:05.918
What's wrong with you?

31:06.151 --> 31:07.605
June seems emotional.

31:08.498 --> 31:10.930
Of course she's emotional.
she was shot.

31:10.931 --> 31:13.189
That's not the kind of emotional
I'm talking about. Hey, hey!

31:15.332 --> 31:16.533
Look at her.

31:19.765 --> 31:20.901
Kim's dead?

31:23.365 --> 31:24.584
Yeah, he died on the scene

31:25.365 --> 31:27.072
From a gunshot wound
to the chest.

31:29.672 --> 31:31.829
That's why you were there
with the police radio.

31:32.005 --> 31:34.450
You weren't responding
to the call,

31:34.489 --> 31:37.307
'Cause you were already there
as a lookout

31:37.372 --> 31:39.129
And the getaway driver.

31:39.272 --> 31:41.504
No. I just got the radio.

31:42.589 --> 31:43.588
For Kim.

31:44.222 --> 31:46.001
Yes. I mean no.

31:46.555 --> 31:47.965
Kim loves me.

31:48.622 --> 31:50.851
It took a while,
but we found each other.

31:51.405 --> 31:53.861
We hadn't seen each other
since high school in Yonkers,

31:53.905 --> 31:56.230
And then there he was,
outside of the precinct,

31:56.255 --> 31:58.440
And he looked me up.
That's the kind of guy he was.

31:58.455 --> 32:02.795
And you fed him information.
-Kim's gone, June.

32:02.822 --> 32:06.644
It's time to start worrying
about yourself. I told Kim things-

32:07.489 --> 32:09.280
Who was working,
where and when.

32:09.639 --> 32:12.321
Eventually I was able
to pinch some uniforms

32:12.322 --> 32:13.862
And some dupe shields.

32:14.822 --> 32:16.753
No one noticed.
No one ever noticed.

32:16.754 --> 32:18.832
Nobody noticed me except Kim.

32:19.454 --> 32:22.019
And the radio message that
called off Chris and Ray-

32:22.170 --> 32:23.506
That was you?

32:23.588 --> 32:24.087
Yes.

32:25.921 --> 32:27.984
I thought you always wanted
to join me on the bureau.

32:28.638 --> 32:29.561
And be like you-

32:30.788 --> 32:32.930
Taking the same crap,
day after day?

32:34.021 --> 32:36.520
You're fooling yourself
if you ever think

32:36.521 --> 32:38.139
They'll accept you
as one of them.

32:38.420 --> 32:41.941
Junie, you know who
was fooling themselves?

32:46.065 --> 32:47.287
This, um...

32:53.993 --> 32:54.878
Listen to me.

32:59.427 --> 33:03.785
I know what it feels like
to be alone.

33:04.660 --> 33:07.803
It's like
someone's stolen away

33:08.003 --> 33:12.017
The one thing in the world
you cared most about.

33:14.619 --> 33:15.926
It happened
to me, too.

33:16.910 --> 33:20.008
The universe
knocked me sideways

33:21.719 --> 33:23.585
And took away everything

33:24.984 --> 33:27.853
And everyone
I ever cared about.

33:31.718 --> 33:32.755
You and me...

33:35.441 --> 33:37.481
We have the same
lonely, blue heart, June.

33:40.475 --> 33:41.132
Yeah.

33:42.509 --> 33:44.715
I guess I do have
a lonely, blue heart.

33:46.658 --> 33:47.212
Yeah.

33:50.417 --> 33:52.160
Kim told me things. uh...

33:54.016 --> 33:55.964
He was working with two guys,
uh...

33:57.683 --> 34:00.008
Dax Benson
and Freddy Gerard.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.388
Okay. Do you know
where we can find them?

34:06.284 --> 34:08.254
I promised Kim
I wouldn't say anything.

34:08.350 --> 34:12.987
June, June, I'm sorry,
but it wasn't real.

34:15.234 --> 34:18.576
What you think you had
with Trent was not real.

34:19.783 --> 34:21.449
You're protecting
the same man

34:21.449 --> 34:23.132
Who put you
in this hospital bed.

34:23.167 --> 34:25.708
He's killed four innocent
people. Do you understand?

34:27.243 --> 34:28.670
It's time
to tell us everything.

34:30.958 --> 34:32.759
'Cause lonely, blue hearts
tell the truth.

34:56.926 --> 34:59.810
Get down!
Oolice! don't move!

35:01.276 --> 35:04.081
You are surrounded
by armed bastards.

35:26.909 --> 35:28.026
On the deck.

35:36.926 --> 35:39.226
Dax Benson!
Hold it right there.

35:40.193 --> 35:42.243
Put your feet on the ground.
Put your hands on your head.

35:42.492 --> 35:43.612
You are under arrest.

35:45.492 --> 35:46.834
Just in time, boys.

35:47.042 --> 35:49.258
Drop it.
No, no, no, no! whoa!

35:49.259 --> 35:50.113
Ohh!

35:51.660 --> 35:52.743
I'm on the job!

35:54.043 --> 35:55.842
I'm a cop! he's not!

35:56.610 --> 35:59.503
I'm real! he's not!
Get off me!

36:00.143 --> 36:01.064
Uhh!

36:02.143 --> 36:04.207
Real cops don't run away.

36:06.295 --> 36:07.465
Lieutenant Gene Hunt,

36:07.562 --> 36:08.926
1-2-5.

36:08.927 --> 36:09.609
What?

36:12.052 --> 36:13.644
Kindly get off of my man.

36:17.935 --> 36:18.966
Shut up.

36:19.779 --> 36:23.962
Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Move.

36:24.071 --> 36:25.071
This is why Trent's crew

36:25.071 --> 36:27.568
Hit so many
Check cashing stores so quick.

36:27.772 --> 36:30.307
They needed cash 'cause there
was a shipment on the way.

36:32.505 --> 36:33.680
All right, you two,
Let's go.

36:38.705 --> 36:41.181
Heroin...
Yahtzee!

36:41.188 --> 36:42.352
And lots of it.

36:42.955 --> 36:44.096
Move over.
Come on.

36:50.621 --> 36:51.973
All right, step up.

37:13.005 --> 37:14.285
You did good, Tyler.

37:17.920 --> 37:20.505
But next time you start
having words with an A.D.A.,

37:21.322 --> 37:23.621
You make damn sure
I know ahead of time.

37:25.690 --> 37:26.994
See you tomorrow, boss.

37:31.957 --> 37:33.633
We'll be out of here
in five.

37:36.251 --> 37:38.841
Once again, you walk io
the space I was headed for.

37:41.782 --> 37:44.004
You and I are not gonna
Get along, are we?

37:44.097 --> 37:44.781
Nope.

37:46.426 --> 37:48.745
Eventually,
I will burn you down,

37:49.525 --> 37:52.336
And I will bag your ashes,
And I will bury your ashes

37:52.358 --> 37:54.992
In the yard
where my big dog craps big crap.

38:03.167 --> 38:04.500
Anyway, wow.

38:04.501 --> 38:05.776
I asked you for help.

38:06.401 --> 38:08.994
You made me out to be a rat.
It wasn't like that.

38:09.117 --> 38:11.283
Gene has a way
of doing things.

38:11.584 --> 38:13.493
I have a way
of dealing with him.

38:13.634 --> 38:15.332
It's nothing personal.

38:17.326 --> 38:19.210
Sam, he's right.

38:19.409 --> 38:21.525
It's complicated
dealing with Hunt.

38:21.626 --> 38:23.777
You of all people
should know that.

38:27.193 --> 38:27.798
What's that?

38:29.360 --> 38:30.625
Oh, um,

38:30.626 --> 38:33.164
Well, Lee got us tickets
to see "Grease."

38:33.576 --> 38:35.774
You know, it's been
playing for a year,

38:35.775 --> 38:37.667
And I've been dying
to see it, so...

38:39.175 --> 38:41.666
Summer lovin'.
Had me a blast.

38:44.843 --> 38:45.977
I got a dinner to get to.

38:46.793 --> 38:47.743
I'll see you later, Annie.

38:48.993 --> 38:49.917
Sam.

38:53.726 --> 38:54.817
You okay, Sam?

38:55.593 --> 38:57.952
Yeah. Fine.

38:59.093 --> 38:59.393
Sam?

39:03.459 --> 39:04.489
You're a good cop, Sam.

39:05.526 --> 39:06.525
There's less heroinon the street

39:06.526 --> 39:08.127
'Cause you're
in the 1-2-5.

39:10.610 --> 39:13.079
And that is very real.

39:15.525 --> 39:16.689
Good night, Annie.

39:18.292 --> 39:19.188
Good night, Sam.

39:43.125 --> 39:45.594
<i>I miss you, too, baby.</i>

39:47.092 --> 39:48.015
<i>I miss you, too,</i>

39:48.659 --> 39:50.858
<i>From the bottom of
my lonely, blue heart.</i>

40:03.343 --> 40:04.564
Time to dance, 2B.
