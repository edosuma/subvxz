00:15.709 --> 00:20.208
Mr. Weinerman, how in the name
of industrial food service,

00:20.291 --> 00:22.959
did you single-handedly
perpetrate the worst caf-atastrophe

00:23.041 --> 00:24.291
since the meat slide of '02?

00:24.375 --> 00:26.834
I'd be happy to explain...
and once you've heard me out

00:26.917 --> 00:30.458
I think you'll agree,
this was not my fault.

00:30.542 --> 00:32.041
Sorry sir, just one moment.

00:32.125 --> 00:33.625
What part of
"while you're up there,

00:33.709 --> 00:35.417
could you get me some
extra cheese" led to this?

00:35.500 --> 00:38.500
I admit, it was an
unlikely series of events.

00:38.583 --> 00:41.834
But check it, I'm about to drop
an awesome excuse on Slimmers.

00:41.917 --> 00:45.041
You've done epic damage here.
Like, more than usual.

00:45.125 --> 00:47.458
I think it's safer
if I handled this one.

00:47.542 --> 00:51.250
-But my excuse!
-(tsking) Trust me, trust me!

00:51.333 --> 00:55.417
Principal Slimowitz,
Randy Cunningham for the defense.

00:55.500 --> 00:58.625
And I rest my case.
You're welcome.

00:58.709 --> 01:01.625
Wow, I can't believe
I was going to give

01:01.709 --> 01:03.750
Howard a week's detention
for that.

01:03.834 --> 01:07.875
The important thing is I showed up
and explained everything.

01:07.959 --> 01:10.000
Based solely on
your explanation,

01:10.083 --> 01:13.875
and no other evidence, I'm sending
Mr. Weinerman to Detention Island.

01:13.959 --> 01:15.875
You can't send him
to Detention Island.

01:15.959 --> 01:18.959
-What's Detention Island?
-I have no idea.

01:19.041 --> 01:20.750
You're probably thinking,

01:20.834 --> 01:23.834
"Sending a bunch of kids
to a former top-secret military prison

01:23.917 --> 01:27.917
to face punishments tailored
to their crime sounds a teensy bit crazy."

01:28.000 --> 01:29.709
Sounds a teensy ton-crazy.

01:29.792 --> 01:33.375
But it's school board approved,
so don't forget your sunscreen.

01:33.458 --> 01:35.125
He was going to give me
a week's detention.

01:35.208 --> 01:36.625
A week!

01:37.667 --> 01:39.667
Next time you want to help...

01:39.750 --> 01:41.041
don't help!

01:42.917 --> 01:45.875
Howard doesn't mean that. I mean,
he's saying it, but he doesn't mean it.

01:48.792 --> 01:51.667
OK NinjaNomicon,
I may be partially

01:51.750 --> 01:54.709
or completely responsible for
getting Howard into this mess.

01:54.792 --> 01:56.792
The question is,
how do I get him out?

01:56.875 --> 01:59.792
(shouting)

01:59.875 --> 02:01.208
(grunts)

02:01.291 --> 02:03.834
(groans) Oh, it's a dragon!

02:03.917 --> 02:05.667
-(growls)
-(Randy yells)

02:05.750 --> 02:09.625
"Let the warrior who holds
the weapon fight the battle"

02:09.709 --> 02:12.834
Huh? Warriors.

02:14.709 --> 02:17.083
Who's going to fight him, huh?
Which one of you guys?

02:17.166 --> 02:18.792
Mallet-guy, Stabby-guy,

02:18.875 --> 02:22.166
Sai-guy or girl,
or Arrow-man?

02:22.250 --> 02:24.291
Arrow-man!

02:24.375 --> 02:26.458
That's it!
I hold the weapon!

02:26.542 --> 02:28.375
(gasps) I'm the warrior!

02:28.458 --> 02:30.542
I can't let Howard
fight this battle.

02:30.625 --> 02:31.917
The ninja has to fight it!

02:32.000 --> 02:34.041
(heroic music plays)

02:35.959 --> 02:37.667
Seen it.

02:37.750 --> 02:40.291
-Seen it... Seen it.
-(channels changing)

02:47.125 --> 02:48.125
(grunts)

02:48.208 --> 02:50.291
That was a rough sanding!

02:50.375 --> 02:52.083
(chuckles) Beach-zing!

02:52.166 --> 02:53.875
Oh, Hensletter?

02:53.959 --> 02:55.625
How'd a shoob like you
get detention?

02:55.709 --> 02:58.500
I skipped science class
to watch a daylight meteor shower.

02:58.583 --> 03:00.750
It was a flock of geese,
they pooped on me.

03:00.834 --> 03:02.583
(laughs) He said "geese."

03:02.667 --> 03:05.333
Bash is here. Sweet.

03:05.417 --> 03:06.875
Morgan is here.

03:06.959 --> 03:08.750
Sweet!

03:08.834 --> 03:10.041
Whatever.

03:10.125 --> 03:11.625
Welcome to Detention Island,

03:11.709 --> 03:13.375
I'm the Disciplinarian.

03:13.458 --> 03:15.125
Please to meet you...

03:15.208 --> 03:17.667
Pshaw! He tried to
shake hands with a movie.

03:17.750 --> 03:19.750
(grunting)

03:19.834 --> 03:24.333
You're all here because
you got in trouble. Oh, sad face.

03:24.417 --> 03:28.083
That's why I'm giving you the
chance to redeem yourselves.

03:28.166 --> 03:32.125
This island has cooked up some
challenges based on your oopsies!

03:32.208 --> 03:34.250
Skipping class,

03:34.333 --> 03:37.250
shaking your booty in a
no-booty-shaking zone.

03:37.333 --> 03:38.625
Uh-uh, no girl.

03:38.709 --> 03:40.709
Cheating... At gym?!

03:40.792 --> 03:43.917
And causing a
caf-atastrophe?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.375
Whatever the
heck that is.

03:46.458 --> 03:49.667
Get to the air pad on
Detention Mountain and that's it...

03:49.750 --> 03:52.333
You're done.
Oh, and one other thing...

03:52.417 --> 03:56.834
I really hate cheaters.
So don't do that, OK?

03:59.583 --> 04:01.500
-(alarm sounding)
-Huh?

04:01.583 --> 04:03.667
(gasps)

04:03.750 --> 04:04.917
(groans)

04:06.291 --> 04:08.375
How's it going?

04:08.458 --> 04:11.250
You smuggled a ninja
onto the island with you?

04:11.333 --> 04:13.792
That's cheating!

04:13.875 --> 04:16.041
Cheaters get the
maximum punishment.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.709
Welcome to Detention Island!

04:20.375 --> 04:22.458
(Randy) You're not thinking about this
the right way.

04:22.542 --> 04:26.417
Now you have a ninja
to help you on Death-tention Island.

04:26.500 --> 04:30.417
If you weren't here
it wouldn't be Death-tention Island!

04:30.500 --> 04:32.667
You skipped science, Bucky!

04:32.750 --> 04:34.875
Time for a make-up exam!

04:34.959 --> 04:38.041
And just to make sure
you don't get any help...

04:38.125 --> 04:40.208
(Bucky whimpers)
I'm not good with heights!

04:40.291 --> 04:42.959
Name the three main rocks
found on this island.

04:43.041 --> 04:44.792
-I should know it now.
-He's gonna choke!

04:44.875 --> 04:46.875
-I gotta help!
-Let him handle this.

04:46.959 --> 04:50.667
But NinjaNomicon says
I have the weapons, I fight the battles.

04:50.750 --> 04:53.250
-You have five seconds.
-I know this.

04:53.333 --> 04:55.250
Allow me, befuddled student.

04:55.333 --> 04:57.041
The three main rocks
on this island are

04:57.125 --> 05:00.417
ninja ring, ninja ring,
and ninja ring!

05:00.500 --> 05:03.500
Ha! He tried to
ninja ring a movie.

05:03.583 --> 05:06.667
Guys, I warned you
about cheating.

05:06.750 --> 05:09.208
You fail!

05:12.792 --> 05:15.375
(all shouting)

05:15.458 --> 05:17.083
Classmate save!

05:17.166 --> 05:20.083
Whoo! It's a close one,
right guys?

05:22.917 --> 05:24.834
-(bats screeching)
-(all shout)

05:26.333 --> 05:28.834
(Randy) Something bad
is about to happen.

05:28.917 --> 05:32.458
What was your first clue?
Cave? Bats? Scary organ music?

05:32.542 --> 05:35.917
Hey, look who it is!
The cheaters.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.375
Morgan, for unauthorized
booty shaking,

05:38.375 --> 05:40.333
we were going to have
a little dance off.

05:40.417 --> 05:42.792
You know, teach you a lesson,
get some exercise...

05:42.875 --> 05:45.917
but since you can't
help cheating,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.333
you're going to
dance for your life!

05:49.417 --> 05:52.959
-(dance beat plays)
-Welcome to my Rave Cave.

05:53.041 --> 05:55.917
(vocoded) Match my moves
while I drop that beat.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.083
One wrong step
and you'll be flat.

05:59.166 --> 06:01.792
B-flat... (laughs)
Musical zing!

06:02.959 --> 06:06.083
Private Beats!
Drop it like it's hot.

06:08.083 --> 06:10.250
Don't worry,
I'll save you!

06:10.333 --> 06:13.959
Please, I so got this.
I was born on a dance floor.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.834
Literally. Whoa.

06:20.250 --> 06:23.625
(dance music plays)

06:25.333 --> 06:27.333
Turn around
and snap it.

06:29.875 --> 06:32.000
(music speeds up)

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
(screams)

06:37.083 --> 06:38.709
(tempo increases)

06:42.166 --> 06:45.208
-(buzzing)
-Uh...

06:45.291 --> 06:46.709
I gotta get in there.

06:46.792 --> 06:50.166
That is Morgan's punishment.
Let her handle it.

06:50.250 --> 06:54.583
OK, I would... but as holder of the weapon
I must fight this battle.

06:54.667 --> 06:57.667
(grunts) Let me
take a stab at it...

06:59.375 --> 07:01.458
Ninja Private B-Flat!

07:02.291 --> 07:03.583
Cheater!

07:03.667 --> 07:05.291
(gasps)

07:07.709 --> 07:09.291
(Morgan yells)

07:11.291 --> 07:12.750
Ninja Air Bass!

07:16.291 --> 07:18.667
(grunts) Everyone, quick!
Squeeze through my crack!

07:18.750 --> 07:20.583
Out of my way!
I'm the first one in the crack!

07:20.667 --> 07:22.917
I'm not touching
that zing.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.500
(shouting)

07:29.542 --> 07:32.083
I'm putting that one in the win column.
Who's with me?

07:32.166 --> 07:34.125
I hate to even suggest this,

07:34.208 --> 07:35.875
but are you trying to kill us?

07:35.959 --> 07:37.750
I'm the ninja. I help you.

07:37.834 --> 07:40.875
You. Perhaps you could explain
to your friends how awesome I am.

07:40.959 --> 07:43.417
Oh, no.
I'm with them.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.458
Your help got me here
in the first place.

07:45.542 --> 07:47.875
But I have the weapons.
I mean, look at them!

07:47.959 --> 07:50.250
I got a sword,
I got a sai!

07:50.333 --> 07:53.250
I got a this thing!
I don't even know what this thing is.

07:53.333 --> 07:56.917
What the juice? I'm doing exactly
what the Nomicon said.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.917
(all shouting)

07:59.959 --> 08:02.542
-(laughing)
-What's going on here?

08:02.625 --> 08:05.750
Well, Bash was going to have
to shoot an arrow at a target,

08:05.834 --> 08:07.709
but since you've been
"helping us"

08:07.792 --> 08:09.875
Captain Punishment
decided to do this!

08:12.291 --> 08:14.500
Hey! I'm having an idea!

08:14.583 --> 08:16.583
Bash, please,
I'll handle this.

08:16.667 --> 08:18.625
No! I want to hear Bash's idea.

08:18.709 --> 08:20.542
Why can't you just let people
do what they're good at?

08:20.625 --> 08:22.208
But the Nomicon
told me to help you.

08:22.291 --> 08:25.458
It said, "Let the warrior who holds
the weapon fight the battle."

08:27.333 --> 08:31.458
Oh, you are the warriors.
You all held the weapons.

08:31.542 --> 08:34.041
I should've let you
fight your own battles.

08:34.125 --> 08:35.959
OK, Bash,
what's your idea?

08:36.041 --> 08:39.417
Oh, I lost it!
No, wait, I found it.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.875
It was right here in my thinking muscle
the whole time!

08:41.959 --> 08:44.750
I don't want to do this.

08:44.834 --> 08:47.667
Re-thinking things up! A little bit
this way... Now back that way.

08:47.750 --> 08:49.709
Just a skosh!
Perfect! Fire!

08:49.792 --> 08:51.542
(screaming)

08:53.625 --> 08:55.417
I'm of help!

08:55.500 --> 08:58.625
Noble warrior, we are
saved thanks to your plan.

08:58.709 --> 09:02.333
What plan? I just wanted to launch
a nerd! He really flew, didn't he?

09:05.125 --> 09:06.792
(grunts)

09:06.875 --> 09:09.375
We made it! Hurray!

09:09.458 --> 09:10.625
That was intense.

09:10.709 --> 09:12.667
Everybody to
the dirigible!

09:12.750 --> 09:15.834
No! Cheaters don't
leave the island.

09:15.917 --> 09:18.458
Relax,
he's only a hologram.

09:18.542 --> 09:20.834
Cheater!

09:20.917 --> 09:23.667
No. No, he's a robot.
He is all robot.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.875
This one hasn't
been punished yet.

09:25.959 --> 09:28.709
I... This whole day's
been one big punishment.

09:28.792 --> 09:30.750
I hold the weapon.
I fight the battle!

09:30.834 --> 09:32.875
Ninja Arm Slice!

09:32.959 --> 09:35.792
Howard, run!

09:35.875 --> 09:38.458
Time to punish
the Disciplinarian.

09:39.750 --> 09:41.375
(screams)

09:41.458 --> 09:44.500
(grunting) Ninja dodge!

09:48.333 --> 09:49.291
Dodge!

09:52.041 --> 09:54.625
-Uh oh!
-(cackling)

09:54.709 --> 09:55.959
Oh...

09:56.041 --> 09:58.166
Eat lava!

09:58.250 --> 10:00.917
(coughing)

10:05.000 --> 10:07.750
Detention is dunzo.

10:09.166 --> 10:12.375
I just got a call from EPS saying
you destroyed Detention Island!

10:12.458 --> 10:14.125
You're all in a lot of trouble!

10:14.208 --> 10:17.542
-(groans)
-Why don't you take this one, Big H?

10:17.625 --> 10:19.583
(clearing throat)
Principal Slimowitz?

10:19.667 --> 10:21.875
Once you've heard me out,
I think you'll agree

10:21.959 --> 10:24.041
this was not our fault.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.875
(laughs) Wow!

10:26.959 --> 10:29.500
That was a lot of words
you just said,

10:29.583 --> 10:32.208
and they've convinced me that
none of this was your fault.

10:32.291 --> 10:34.333
-Mm-hm.
-(all cheering)

10:34.417 --> 10:37.500
Now if you'll excuse me,
I need to cancel a lease on an island.

10:37.583 --> 10:38.834
Next time
we get in trouble,

10:38.917 --> 10:41.291
I will definitely
let you do the talking.

10:41.375 --> 10:46.500
Forget it. I'm not doing anything
to get in trouble ever again.

10:46.583 --> 10:48.750
Hey fellas, I gotta hit the can.

10:48.834 --> 10:50.917
Could you keep an eye
on this barrel of pudding?

10:51.000 --> 10:53.875
Whatever you do,
do not get it near the jet engine.

10:53.959 --> 10:55.959
Cool? Cool.

10:56.041 --> 10:57.834
See you in detention?

10:57.917 --> 10:59.500
See you in detention.

11:02.959 --> 11:04.542
(fight grunting)

11:08.000 --> 11:09.875
(Randy) Looking for me?

11:10.875 --> 11:13.125
Listen, Pradeep, it's
Gravy Friday in the caf,

11:13.208 --> 11:17.500
so it'd be aces if we could
wrap this up like now.

11:17.583 --> 11:19.083
(grunting)

11:19.166 --> 11:21.583
(shouting)

11:26.667 --> 11:28.750
Gotta make some room
for gravy fries!

11:28.834 --> 11:30.709
Better take a Mr. Grumpy!

11:32.709 --> 11:34.208
Ninja Horn Slap!

11:35.667 --> 11:36.875
-Huh?
-Hyah!

11:36.959 --> 11:39.375
I'm uncomfortable
around curly things.

11:39.458 --> 11:40.834
I'm going to straighten it.

11:42.333 --> 11:45.000
Huh? That's weird.

11:45.083 --> 11:48.917
But hey, Gravy Friday is not the day
to look a 3D-Stankin' in the mouth.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.834
Smoke bomb!

11:50.917 --> 11:51.875
(coughs)

11:54.333 --> 11:57.959
Bash Johnson?
You vanquished the monster!

11:58.041 --> 12:01.125
I wouldn't call it a monster.
I've taken bigger ones.

12:01.208 --> 12:04.667
One day a year, the lunch lady
scrapes the grease traps

12:04.750 --> 12:07.291
into a chunky meaty
mudslide of yum.

12:07.375 --> 12:09.375
Today is that day.

12:09.458 --> 12:12.792
Gravy fries,
prepare to be in my mouth!

12:12.875 --> 12:14.709
(gasps)

12:14.792 --> 12:17.125
Who? What? When? Where? Why?

12:17.208 --> 12:19.667
How?!

12:21.959 --> 12:23.750
(belching)

12:23.834 --> 12:26.000
In my defense, gravy fries.

12:26.083 --> 12:29.917
And I counter with, "How could you
do this to your best friend?!"

12:30.000 --> 12:32.166
Relax.
Just get back in line.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.875
(Randy groans)

12:33.959 --> 12:35.792
I could really use a change
of subject right now.

12:35.875 --> 12:37.667
Bash Johnson is the ninja!

12:37.750 --> 12:39.500
-Jackpot!
-(all gasp)

12:39.583 --> 12:41.750
Yay! Bash-a-ray!

12:41.834 --> 12:42.709
What are you lookin' at?

12:44.125 --> 12:48.667
(laughs) Come on!

12:48.750 --> 12:52.667
Oh, I have not laughed
this hard in a long time.

12:52.750 --> 12:57.250
Eh, wait? You guys actually believe
that Bash is the ninja?

12:57.333 --> 12:59.542
Bash? Bash.

12:59.625 --> 13:02.875
O.M. Wowzers!
Totally makes sense.

13:02.959 --> 13:06.750
Yeah, being a butthead is the
perfect cover for the ninja.

13:06.834 --> 13:09.583
All year I've been getting
wedgies from a hero.

13:09.667 --> 13:12.000
-What an honor!
-Did you know about this?

13:12.083 --> 13:14.375
Sorry, got caught up
in the hoopla.

13:14.458 --> 13:17.041
Bash is the ninja? I'm Bash.

13:17.125 --> 13:19.792
That means... I'm the ninja?

13:19.875 --> 13:22.709
-I'm the ninja! (whooping)
-(all cheering)

13:22.792 --> 13:23.709
(growling)

13:31.500 --> 13:36.375
There's a strange mix of jubilation
and gravy in the air today.

13:36.458 --> 13:39.166
What have we here?

13:39.250 --> 13:40.667
Smoke bomb!

13:40.750 --> 13:44.750
Pleased to meet you, Ninja!

13:44.834 --> 13:47.125
(laughing)

13:48.959 --> 13:50.500
This is bad, Howard.

13:50.583 --> 13:53.417
You're not the one running laps
on two baskets of gravy fries.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.750
A, one of those
baskets was mine.

13:55.834 --> 13:59.875
And b, I'm talking about everybody
thinking Bash is the ninja.

13:59.959 --> 14:02.750
Keeping the ninja's identity
a secret is Nomicon 101.

14:02.834 --> 14:05.667
Trust me, something wonk
is going to happen to Bash.

14:05.750 --> 14:07.834
-Huh?
-If Y equals 2...

14:07.917 --> 14:11.625
-Then X equals... poo!
-(students laugh)

14:11.709 --> 14:15.000
Poo is correct!
A+ for the ninja!

14:15.083 --> 14:18.750
Oh... are you kidding me?

14:18.834 --> 14:20.792
<i>♪ Bash! Bash!</i>
<i>He's Bash Johnson ♪</i>

14:20.875 --> 14:23.375
<i>♪ Turns out he's a ninja</i>
<i>and he's better than you ♪</i>

14:23.458 --> 14:25.583
<i>♪ Bash! Bash!</i>
<i>He's Bash Johnson ♪</i>

14:25.667 --> 14:27.917
<i>♪ Turns out he's a ninja</i>
<i>and he's better than you... ♪</i>

14:28.000 --> 14:30.333
That's right, that's right...

14:30.417 --> 14:31.834
I'm the ninja.

14:31.917 --> 14:34.417
Bow down before me.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.750
Hmm.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.917
(Hannibal)
I'm a super villain, Viceroy.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.125
I should not be helping my wife select
bedroom furniture for my stepson!

14:43.208 --> 14:44.792
Hannibal, just pick a bed.

14:44.875 --> 14:47.959
Which one would Bash like better?
Rocket ship or race car?

14:48.041 --> 14:50.917
Ooh, sign me up for
"enchanted castle!"

14:52.166 --> 14:54.792
-McFist!
-(all yelp)

14:54.875 --> 14:58.750
A fascinating piece of information
has come into my possession.

14:58.834 --> 15:01.792
The ninja's true identity.

15:01.875 --> 15:05.792
Wow. Kind of blindsided
me with that one.

15:05.875 --> 15:10.250
With this knowledge,
you can finally destroy the ninja.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.083
Destroy, of course.
Right away!

15:12.166 --> 15:15.208
(woman giggling) <i>Hannibal,</i>
<i>the decorator's here!</i>

15:15.291 --> 15:17.583
Uh... Just one second,
sugar balls.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.208
-What are you waiting for?!
-What are you waiting for?!

15:20.291 --> 15:22.375
Emergency
McExtermination Protocol!

15:22.417 --> 15:26.041
But sir, once activated the McXP
cannot be stopped for any reason.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.250
-Just do it!
-OK.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.917
(woman) <i>Hannibal? Now.</i>

15:32.000 --> 15:33.834
Coming. Coming!

15:33.917 --> 15:35.750
Look, I got a thing to do...

15:35.834 --> 15:39.709
Handle this. I'll be back in
time to destroy the ninja.

15:39.792 --> 15:41.583
-Hmm.
-Behold...

15:41.667 --> 15:44.750
The true face of the ninja!

15:46.375 --> 15:47.959
Do you mind? I can't see.

15:48.041 --> 15:53.208
Destroy him and
I will be free!

15:53.291 --> 15:55.750
(chuckling)

15:55.834 --> 15:57.875
Please tell me
you saw that.

15:57.959 --> 15:59.083
We got it.

16:02.542 --> 16:05.875
See, punching is fun.
But kicking... that's real fun.

16:05.959 --> 16:09.458
Ninja? Got a little
treat for you.

16:09.542 --> 16:12.792
Found some extra gravy
between the fryer and the wall.

16:12.875 --> 16:16.792
Oh, gravy fries... my tongue's
wicked happy right now.

16:16.875 --> 16:19.875
-Mm... Oh yeah...
-(whimpers)

16:26.875 --> 16:28.917
What the juice, NinjaNomicon?

16:29.000 --> 16:32.917
I thought revealing my identity
would be bad, but clearly it's awesome.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.917
I mean, I'm the ninja. I should be getting
parades and statues and gravy fries.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.709
Where's my gravy fries?

16:42.250 --> 16:43.709
"Once the ninja is known,

16:43.792 --> 16:45.458
he can never be unknown."

16:45.542 --> 16:47.542
Yes, that's what
I'm talking about.

16:47.625 --> 16:49.375
I've been unknown for too long.

16:49.458 --> 16:52.500
Time to let Norrisville
know who the real ninja is.

16:54.917 --> 16:56.875
(dance music plays)

16:59.792 --> 17:02.583
This is the best ninja show
I've seen in a long time.

17:02.667 --> 17:04.542
No offense.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.750
(gasps) What are you doing?

17:10.834 --> 17:13.041
I'm grabbing life
by the gravy fries.

17:13.125 --> 17:17.125
OK, everybody to class!
Except you, ninja.

17:17.208 --> 17:20.000
-You do whatever you want.
-Cool!

17:20.083 --> 17:21.583
I'm going to go
nap in your office.

17:21.667 --> 17:22.750
(gasps)

17:22.834 --> 17:24.917
Sweet dreams.

17:27.417 --> 17:29.417
Hey! Get out of the ninja's way!

17:29.500 --> 17:31.500
I was about to tell
you the same thing.

17:31.583 --> 17:33.917
That's very confusing.
What are you...

17:44.125 --> 17:45.917
We got the ninja.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.750
-What happened to Bash?
-Something bad.

17:51.834 --> 17:54.667
I knew it. Revealing
your identity is dangerous.

17:54.750 --> 17:56.166
That's exactly why
I didn't do it.

17:56.250 --> 17:57.333
Hm.

17:57.417 --> 17:59.917
OK, OK. I was going to do it,
but I didn't. So let's move on.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.500
-Shouldn't you...
-I'm going, I'm going.

18:05.875 --> 18:07.250
Ninja-Chain-tacle!

18:11.875 --> 18:15.792
Hm? Don't worry Bash.
The real ninja's coming.

18:15.875 --> 18:17.875
Even though you did
eat his gravy fries.

18:19.625 --> 18:21.041
I don't get it.
For that kind of money,

18:21.125 --> 18:23.750
a decorator should tell you more
than, "Paint the walls blue."

18:23.834 --> 18:25.125
Everything's ready to go.

18:25.208 --> 18:27.792
Just waiting for the Robo-Apes
to deliver the ninja.

18:27.875 --> 18:30.458
-They're here.
-They're here!

18:30.542 --> 18:33.041
Time to exterminate the ninja!

18:33.125 --> 18:35.542
Robo-Apes, before
you vaporize him.

18:35.625 --> 18:38.417
Let me get a look at his
weasely little ninja face.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.417
Better get the Sorcerer
on the horn.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.417
It was... (yells)

18:42.500 --> 18:44.041
Hang up! Hang up!

18:44.125 --> 18:46.250
-Hm?
-Hey, thanks for the ride home!

18:46.333 --> 18:48.792
-Our pleasure.
-Bash is the ninja?

18:48.875 --> 18:52.083
Impossible!
There is no way my stepson

18:52.166 --> 18:54.834
has thwarted every evil
scheme I've ever hatched.

18:54.917 --> 18:56.917
If Marcy finds out
I've vaporized her son...

18:57.000 --> 19:00.291
Let's just say, it's not good.
Shut it down!

19:00.375 --> 19:03.041
I told you once you initiate
the McExtermination Protocol

19:03.125 --> 19:04.625
there's no shutting it down.

19:04.709 --> 19:06.208
Why would you
build it like that?

19:06.291 --> 19:09.709
-You told me to.
-Why did you listen to me?!

19:09.792 --> 19:12.208
This is making my toes sweat!

19:12.291 --> 19:15.417
He's not the ninja!

19:15.500 --> 19:18.333
You also told me to
make it sound proof.

19:18.417 --> 19:20.458
(yelling)

19:21.917 --> 19:23.208
Hey Larry, where ya been?

19:23.291 --> 19:25.875
In the can again?
(laughs)

19:30.709 --> 19:32.500
Larry!
What's gotten into you?

19:32.583 --> 19:35.083
Uh-oh, why are you
wearing Larry?

19:35.166 --> 19:38.083
Because once the ninja is known,
he can never be unknown.

19:38.166 --> 19:40.166
And if you'd known it was me,
you would've never let me in.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.667
Processing. Processing...

19:41.750 --> 19:43.750
No! Ninja Surprise Rescue!

19:43.834 --> 19:45.625
Still processing.

19:45.709 --> 19:47.291
Bash, I'm here to save you.

19:47.375 --> 19:49.583
I'm the ninja.
I'm here to save you!

19:49.667 --> 19:53.125
So Bash isn't the ninja,
but the Robo-Ape is the ninja.

19:53.208 --> 19:55.750
Oh boy, this one has
gone off the rail.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.083
-(shouting)
-(gasps)

19:57.166 --> 20:00.417
Must exterminate all ninjas.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.542
-Bring it on!
-(grunts)

20:05.792 --> 20:09.333
(grunting) Robo-Apes
are really heavy...

20:09.417 --> 20:12.750
Hey Robot-Monkey!
I'm gonna kick you in the mouth!

20:12.834 --> 20:16.083
-Ninja Blitz!
-Ow.

20:16.166 --> 20:18.500
Get me down from here!
I'm hungry.

20:18.583 --> 20:19.709
(Randy grunts)

20:24.041 --> 20:25.542
(whooping)

20:25.625 --> 20:27.709
Ninja, thanks for saving Bash.

20:27.792 --> 20:30.542
Why don't you stick around
so I can destroy you!

20:30.625 --> 20:34.542
Some other time, McFist.
Smoke bomb!

20:34.625 --> 20:38.709
Sir, the Sorcerer is on line one.
Marcy's on line two.

20:38.792 --> 20:41.500
(groans) Give me whoever
sounds less mad.

20:41.583 --> 20:44.875
-Hello?
-(Sorcerer yelling)

20:44.959 --> 20:50.083
Students of Norrisville,
Bash has something he wants to say!

20:50.166 --> 20:52.333
All right, I ain't the ninja,
you dummies.

20:52.417 --> 20:53.542
-Boo!
-(laughing)

20:53.625 --> 20:55.333
But I'm still Bash Johnson,

20:55.417 --> 20:56.834
and that makes me
better than you!

20:56.917 --> 20:58.000
(whooping)

20:59.041 --> 21:00.166
(yelling)

21:00.250 --> 21:02.959
Hey! Get me off of me! Help!

21:03.041 --> 21:04.250
I'm sorry, ninja.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.792
I don't know how I could've
thought Bash was you.

21:06.875 --> 21:09.375
-I don't either.
-So, who are you, Ninja?

21:09.458 --> 21:12.667
I'm sorry, young band geek,
but I must remain unknown.

21:12.750 --> 21:14.709
Smoke bomb.

21:14.792 --> 21:16.625
Definitely the real ninja.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.667
Woo!
Those things smell like fart!

21:22.792 --> 21:26.291
Listen, I know it's a bummer that
no one knows you're... you know who,

21:26.375 --> 21:28.291
but I know you're
you know who,

21:28.375 --> 21:31.000
so I brought you
gravy fries!

21:31.083 --> 21:35.500
So honkin' Bruce!

21:35.583 --> 21:37.709
-This isn't gravy, is it?
-I had to improvise.

21:37.792 --> 21:39.625
Also, those aren't fries.

21:39.709 --> 21:42.875
