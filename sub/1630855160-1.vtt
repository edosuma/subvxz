SONG: # Here I go

00:15.120 --> 00:18.400
# Out to sea again

00:18.400 --> 00:22.680
# The sunshine fills my head

00:24.240 --> 00:28.840
# And dreams hang in the air

00:31.400 --> 00:33.520
# Gulls in the sky

00:33.520 --> 00:36.880
# And in my blue eyes

00:36.880 --> 00:40.760
# You know it feels unfair

00:42.440 --> 00:47.120
# There's magic everywhere

00:49.640 --> 00:54.200
# Look at me standing

00:54.200 --> 00:58.360
# Here on my own again

00:58.360 --> 01:04.760
# Up straight in the sunshine

01:04.760 --> 01:08.200
# No need to run

01:08.200 --> 01:10.440
# And hide

01:10.440 --> 01:14.240
# It's a wonderful, wonderful life

01:14.240 --> 01:17.360
# No need to laugh

01:17.360 --> 01:19.160
# Or cry

01:19.160 --> 01:25.360
# It's
a wonderful, wonderful life... #

01:25.360 --> 01:28.280
Hey, mate! Over there!

(SIRENS HOWL)

01:54.240 --> 01:58.280
WOMAN: (ON BROADCAST) No formal
identification has yet been made.

01:58.280 --> 02:01.240
The body is believed to be that
of Sophie Chalcott...

02:01.240 --> 02:02.240
(DOOR CLOSES)

02:02.240 --> 02:03.280
..the 19-year-old daughter

02:03.280 --> 02:04.880
of the British
Trade and Industry Minister...

02:04.880 --> 02:06.920
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
..Abigail Crawford.

02:06.920 --> 02:09.440
You wanted to see me, sir?
KILROY: You seen this?

02:09.440 --> 02:11.600
WOMAN: (ON TV)
..Sydney on her gap year.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.040
Her mother
apparently heard of the tragedy

02:13.040 --> 02:16.640
during a House of Commons
select committee hearing.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.200
The press in Australia
is reporting...

02:18.200 --> 02:20.680
We've been invited
to send someone to Sydney

02:20.680 --> 02:22.120
to observe the investigation.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.720
WOMAN: (ON TV)
..by a rock fisherman, not far...

02:23.720 --> 02:26.800
Why?
High-profile case.
..the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge.

02:26.800 --> 02:29.280
Hands across the ocean
and all that crap.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.560
WOMAN: (ON TV) ..how the body
came to be in the water.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.440
The Sydney metropolitan police
are expected to make...

02:33.440 --> 02:35.760
MAN: Any evidence of foul play?
..a formal statement later today.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.560
Not yet, but the Chief Constable
has asked me to volunteer someone.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.120
WOMAN: (ON TV) ..of
Abigail Crawford and her husband...
Congratulations.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.840
..Simon Chalcott.
(LAUGHS) No, sir, I've...

02:43.840 --> 02:46.720
..I've got Michael Mason's
committal hearing in the morning.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.000
DS Metcalfe will handle that.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.720
WOMAN: (ON TV) Abigail Crawford
is considered to be

02:49.720 --> 02:51.840
a close ally of the Prime Minister.

02:51.840 --> 02:52.880
WOMAN: Today?!

02:52.880 --> 02:54.840
I won't go if you don't want me to.

02:54.840 --> 02:58.400
Well, why wouldn't I want you to?
I don't know how long I'll be gone.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.240
I suppose if it IS ruled a murder,

03:00.240 --> 03:04.200
it could be a couple of months,
maybe more.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.000
Well...

03:07.000 --> 03:09.280
..you'd better take
the big suitcase.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.800
Welcome on board.
Thank you.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.200
Uh, 48E.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.200
Thank you, Mr Drummond.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.640
Oh. Thank you.
You're...down there to your left.

03:21.640 --> 03:22.920
Great. Thank you.

(BLOWS NOSE)
This is your captain speaking.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.920
Our flight time to Singapore
this evening

03:34.920 --> 03:38.360
is 13 hours and five minutes.

03:38.360 --> 03:39.360
(BABY CRIES)

03:39.360 --> 03:42.000
So do settle in
and make yourselves comfortable.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.160
And we hope you have
a pleasant and relaxing journey.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.080
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

03:56.920 --> 03:58.720
That's clean, Sarge.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.120
What, nothing?

04:01.120 --> 04:03.200
You want to tell us
where you stashed it?

04:03.200 --> 04:05.120
Do you want to suck my dick?

04:06.280 --> 04:08.040
Come off it.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.480
It was taped
to the inside of your toilet system.
Bullshit.

04:11.480 --> 04:14.040
Michael Mason,
I'm arresting you for the possession
of a controlled drug...

04:14.040 --> 04:15.560
This is a stitch-up.
..with intent to supply.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.640
You don't have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence...

04:17.640 --> 04:19.600
KILROY: You're accusing a colleague
of planting evidence?

04:19.600 --> 04:22.320
No. I'm saying
it wasn't there when I looked.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.280
Maybe you missed it.

04:24.280 --> 04:27.320
We all want Mason for murder.

04:27.320 --> 04:29.640
This is a step
in the right direction.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.640
I won't lie under oath.

I mean, oh...

04:54.960 --> 04:56.360

What's the name of the detective
London's sending out?

Max Drummond.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.760

05:04.760 --> 05:06.560
He's on this flight.

05:18.680 --> 05:20.720
The Secretary of State suggested

05:20.720 --> 05:23.840
I might want to swap seats with you.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.560
(BABY CRIES)
I can't believe you do.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.560
(CLEARS THROAT) Secretary of State.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.280
Detective Sergeant.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.600
Please.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.120
Oh. Thank you.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.440
Sorry.

..call me Abigail.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.240
I'm Max.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.080
I've seen your CV.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.560
Impressive.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.320
You went to university.

06:11.320 --> 06:12.400
Well.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.240
A lot of people do.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.680
Not many who join the police.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.440
What happened?

06:18.440 --> 06:20.760
Your first choice of career
didn't work out?

06:20.760 --> 06:22.920
(LAUGHS) Uh...

06:22.920 --> 06:23.960
(SIGHS)

06:23.960 --> 06:25.680
..well, let's just say that, uh, uh,

06:25.680 --> 06:27.400
being a policeman
was a childhood dream

06:27.400 --> 06:30.040
that I've still not quite
grown out of.

06:30.040 --> 06:33.080
Well, it's good
you've got to live your dream.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.040
What can you tell me
about Sophie's death?

06:42.920 --> 06:45.400
No more
than I'm sure you know already.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.720
Was she murdered?

06:48.760 --> 06:50.480
I don't know.

06:50.480 --> 06:53.400
Might have just been
a tragic accident.

06:53.400 --> 06:57.080
So you could be making
a wasted trip.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.040
I hope so.

07:06.080 --> 07:09.200
WOMAN: If Sophie wasn't murdered,
then it's not our case.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.760
Our boss wants to know
what we're dealing with,

07:10.760 --> 07:12.720
so...what do I tell him?

07:13.760 --> 07:15.440
Patience is a virtue?

07:15.440 --> 07:17.680
You haven't met my boss, have you?

07:17.680 --> 07:19.120
Oh.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.400
You know, I always thought
that if I was to murder someone

07:21.400 --> 07:23.920
and make it look like an accident -

07:23.920 --> 07:26.240
I mean, let's be honest,
who hasn't thought of it? -

07:26.240 --> 07:29.680
um, I'd dump the body in the harbour.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.200
What, so you're saying
she WAS murdered or...

07:33.200 --> 07:35.160
No. No.

07:35.160 --> 07:36.200
You're saying she wasn't?

07:36.200 --> 07:38.480
No, I'm saying
it's just very difficult to tell,

07:38.480 --> 07:40.160
yeah, 'cause in the harbour,
there are, um...

07:40.160 --> 07:42.120
..there are rocks
and there are sharks and there are...

07:42.120 --> 07:44.280
..uh, uh, uh,
boats churning up and down.

07:44.280 --> 07:47.080
I mean,
that can hide a multitude of sins.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.600
But, um, I'll...I'll
surely know more after the autopsy.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.640
Hmm. Then we won't keep you
any longer.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.800
Well...well, no. Um...um...no.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.640
I can't do it yet.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.200
No, I've got three in line
before Sophie.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.440
Well, can she jump the queue?

08:00.440 --> 08:02.520
She is kind of important.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.600
Well, they're all important
to their loved ones.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.760
Hm.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.320
Uh, but, yes, I'll, um...

08:08.320 --> 08:10.000
..I'll see what I can do.

08:12.280 --> 08:15.000
Um...oh, just one...one thing.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.800
Um, this swelling.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.840
I mean, that can only occur
before death.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.040
This bruise here on the...
on the cheek,

08:22.040 --> 08:25.040
that's a little suspicious, yeah.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.160
Do you have children, Max?

08:29.160 --> 08:30.640
Uh, no.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.120
But you're married?

08:35.320 --> 08:37.080
Yeah.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.640
Seven years.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.480
We've tried for a baby. (SIGHS)

08:43.480 --> 08:46.040
IVF even, but...

08:46.040 --> 08:49.240
..I think we may have decided
to give up.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.240
You think you may have?

08:58.360 --> 09:01.760
I used to think there could be
nothing worse... (LAUGHS)

09:01.760 --> 09:03.680
..than not having children.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.480
Well, you're being...

09:09.480 --> 09:11.600
..admirably composed.

09:15.440 --> 09:18.120
It's not all my own doing.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.720
Yes, the two Vs.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.880
Valium and vodka.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.600
Oh, blimey.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.600
That's a powerful combination.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.360
Especially at 35,000 feet.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.360
Thank you.

09:30.360 --> 09:32.400
You'll keep me company?

09:33.720 --> 09:34.720
Yeah. Go on, then.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.160
Erm...bourbon and Coke, please.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.280
Don't worry.

09:52.280 --> 09:54.800
I'm quite in control of myself.

09:56.760 --> 09:59.360
That's something
Sophie used to complain about.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.320
My composure.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.040
"Why can't you just be yourself?"
she'd say.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.200
But this is me.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.520
You must have been very young

10:13.520 --> 10:15.080
when you had Sophie.

10:16.960 --> 10:19.000
23.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.040
We were only just married.

10:25.880 --> 10:28.040
What would you be willing
to tell me about her?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.560
I'd just...

10:31.560 --> 10:33.320
..like to know who she was.

10:36.960 --> 10:38.840
She was, uh...

10:41.400 --> 10:43.160
..infuriating. (LAUGHS)

10:45.760 --> 10:47.320
In a good way.

10:52.600 --> 10:53.600
(UNZIPS CONTAINER)

10:53.600 --> 10:54.800
Wilful.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.440
Even as a child. (LAUGHS)

11:01.280 --> 11:04.080
Used to drive me mad.

11:05.080 --> 11:08.560
But I came to see it
as one of her greatest attributes.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.280
It's hard to believe that...

11:16.280 --> 11:18.760
..that's where the photos will end.

11:20.560 --> 11:25.480
If someone was responsible
for her death,

11:25.480 --> 11:29.360
you'll do everything you can
to bring them to justice?

11:31.760 --> 11:33.480
It's not MY investigation.

11:34.480 --> 11:35.760
I'm just an observer.

11:35.760 --> 11:38.000
You promise me, Max.

11:46.780 --> 11:48.340
For fuck's sake!

11:48.340 --> 11:49.900
What'll I tell the press?

11:49.900 --> 11:52.980
That pending
further investigation...

11:52.980 --> 11:55.060
..we're not sure.

11:55.060 --> 11:57.020
Oh. Brilliant.

11:57.020 --> 11:58.500
Headline writes itself -

11:58.500 --> 11:59.820
"Police clueless."

11:59.820 --> 12:01.780
Literally correct.

12:01.780 --> 12:03.700
We should let the locals handle it.

12:03.700 --> 12:05.580
What about the bruise on her cheek?

12:06.740 --> 12:08.580
Could be anything. Rough sex.
I don't know.

12:08.580 --> 12:09.580
(DETECTIVE LAUGHS)

12:09.580 --> 12:11.420
Interesting -
that's your first thought.

12:13.260 --> 12:15.660
BOSS: Alright. Well,
keep it for now, pending the autopsy.

12:15.660 --> 12:17.300
I'm giving the case to Rob.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.740
What?
BOSS: You don't have the experience.

12:18.740 --> 12:20.380
No, you can't.

12:20.380 --> 12:21.620
You assigned ME.

12:21.620 --> 12:23.140
Paea, would you give us a moment,
please?

12:23.140 --> 12:24.300
PAEA: Yes, sir.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.780
(SIGHS)

12:25.780 --> 12:26.820
Meg.

12:26.820 --> 12:28.940
I'm doing you a favour.

12:28.940 --> 12:31.780
If this gets ruled a homicide,

12:31.780 --> 12:33.660
the scrutiny you'd be under.

12:34.660 --> 12:36.420
Fine.

12:36.420 --> 12:39.380
They talk about
headlines writing themselves.

12:39.380 --> 12:44.740
How about "Male boss
thinks job beyond female cop,

12:44.740 --> 12:47.180
"replaces her with bloke"?

12:47.180 --> 12:48.820
Well, it's a bit long for a headline.

12:51.220 --> 12:52.740
Fuck.

12:54.340 --> 12:55.540
Alright.

12:55.540 --> 12:58.220
Well, let's just hope she got pissed
and fell off a boat.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.860
Is that all, boss?
Yes.

13:01.860 --> 13:04.180
No. Uh...your liaison.

13:05.540 --> 13:06.540
My what?

13:06.540 --> 13:09.260
Some cop from London.
He's coming with the girl's mother.

13:09.260 --> 13:12.820
What? Why? WE don't even know
what we're dealing with.

13:12.820 --> 13:14.660
Well, you'll be dealing with him.

13:14.660 --> 13:16.980
Keeping him abreast
of any developments.

13:16.980 --> 13:17.980
Which shouldn't take long.

13:17.980 --> 13:20.540
And organise a car to pick him up.

13:20.540 --> 13:23.180
Chief, I don't have time
to babysit some Pom

13:23.180 --> 13:24.900
who thinks he's Sherlock Holmes.

13:24.900 --> 13:26.860
Well, I doubt he's all that.
They wouldn't spare a good man.

13:26.860 --> 13:30.300
Even better. Some deadwood
telling me how to do my job.

13:30.300 --> 13:33.140
Would you rather
I took you off the case?

13:33.140 --> 13:34.740
I wouldn't worry.
He's not gonna get in your way.

13:34.740 --> 13:36.340
He doesn't have the jurisdiction.

13:37.340 --> 13:39.300
Does HE know that?

13:39.300 --> 13:41.540
I'm sure you'll make him aware.

13:45.940 --> 13:47.340
How was your flight?

13:51.980 --> 13:53.420

Hey.

13:54.420 --> 13:57.860
I am so sorry.
(DOOR CLOSES)

13:57.860 --> 13:59.620
Thank you.
I mean, words can't even...

13:59.620 --> 14:01.220
Thank you for coming.

14:02.220 --> 14:03.340
Who's that?

14:03.340 --> 14:04.860
Greg Hardy.

14:04.860 --> 14:06.540
Leader of the Labor Party.

14:06.540 --> 14:08.060
The Prime Minister?

14:08.060 --> 14:10.740
You don't follow
Australian politics, do you?

14:10.740 --> 14:13.900
He hopes to be.
There's an election on.

14:13.900 --> 14:15.660
How's Simon?

14:17.460 --> 14:19.220
Beside himself.

14:19.220 --> 14:20.740
As you can imagine.
I'm sure.

14:20.740 --> 14:23.420
Isn't her husband meeting her here?
He's at the hotel.

14:23.420 --> 14:25.180
He flew in last night.

14:25.180 --> 14:28.780
Greg, I'd like you to meet Detective
Sergeant Max Drummond from London.

14:28.780 --> 14:31.060
He was a great comfort to me
on the flight.

14:31.060 --> 14:32.540
Greg Hardy.
Old friend of the family.

14:32.540 --> 14:34.900
Oh, please. I know who YOU are, sir.

14:34.900 --> 14:36.620
Leader of the opposition.

14:36.620 --> 14:39.020
Oh, you're up in your
Australian politics. I'm impressed.

14:40.500 --> 14:43.740
Uh, just to warn you, there
are cameras outside the terminal.

14:43.740 --> 14:44.900
Of course there are.

14:44.900 --> 14:47.540
Did YOU tip them off?

14:47.540 --> 14:49.180
It's fine.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.060
You need the airtime.

14:51.060 --> 14:53.500
I see you've slipped in the polls.
Something about a health scare.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.100
Oh, it's a beat-up.

14:55.100 --> 14:57.900
It's the government flinging mud.
Shows they're desperate.

14:59.340 --> 15:01.660
Can we offer you a lift into town,
Detective Sergeant?

15:01.660 --> 15:04.860
Oh, no, no. Thank you, ma'am.
A...a driver will be picking me up.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.900
Then I'm sure we'll see you soon.
MAN: We should get going.

15:06.900 --> 15:09.380
Look, um, when you're ready.

15:13.940 --> 15:15.100

16:59.300 --> 17:01.300
You did tell 'em that I was here?

17:06.020 --> 17:09.660

I wanted to welcome you personally.

17:09.660 --> 17:10.700
How was your flight?

17:10.700 --> 17:13.300
The last seven hours felt longer.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.820
Yeah. Have you been to your hotel?

17:14.820 --> 17:17.060
No. No, no. I came straight here.

17:17.060 --> 17:18.900
Well, I'll get you a car.
You can check in, freshen up.

17:18.900 --> 17:22.220
Uh, I think I'd rather be
just brought up to speed, sir.

17:22.220 --> 17:23.620
Excellent.

17:23.620 --> 17:27.060
Well, uh,
let's get you sorted with a pass.

17:27.060 --> 17:30.420
PAEA:
And 5:23pm, now, Sophie leaves work,

17:30.420 --> 17:34.740
and she walks down to Circular Quay,
where she meets her boyfriend, Tom.

17:34.740 --> 17:36.700
Now, she meets him for a drink,
and they board the party boat

17:36.700 --> 17:39.020
at 6:17pm not long after.

17:39.020 --> 17:40.380
Everyone.

17:40.380 --> 17:43.060
Uh, this is DS Max Drummond
from the murder squad in London.

17:43.060 --> 17:46.180
DS Meg Driscoll.
She'll be leading the investigation.

17:47.940 --> 17:50.020
We won't hold you up
any further, Meg.

17:50.020 --> 17:52.500
DS Drummond, if you'd, um...

17:52.500 --> 17:53.500
..care to sit here.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.500
Thank you.

17:59.300 --> 18:00.540
PAEA:
Yeah, so they're on the harbour

18:00.540 --> 18:02.420
for the best part of four hours,

18:02.420 --> 18:05.620
all faithfully recorded
on social media,

18:05.620 --> 18:08.500
before disembarking the boat
just a little after 10.

18:08.500 --> 18:11.220
Now, it is here
where Sophie and Tom split up

18:11.220 --> 18:13.780
and Sophie leaves
with her friend Erica

18:13.780 --> 18:15.420
to go to a bar on Loftus Street.

18:15.420 --> 18:19.620
Now, Sophie leaves here alone
at 11:12pm,

18:19.620 --> 18:22.180
goes to the corner of Bridge Street.

18:22.180 --> 18:24.220
And this is the last
that's seen of her.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.180
OK, so Erica says that

18:35.180 --> 18:38.500
Sophie told her
she wants to get some fresh air

18:38.500 --> 18:40.900
and that
she would meet her at home, but...

18:40.900 --> 18:42.580
..she never made it.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.420
The girls are flatmates, right?

18:45.420 --> 18:47.460
Sophie and Erica?

18:47.460 --> 18:48.940
Yes. In Manly.

18:48.940 --> 18:51.740
Have you been offered coffee,
DS Drummond?

18:51.740 --> 18:53.700
Oh, no. Max, please. (LAUGHS)

18:53.700 --> 18:57.260
And, yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you.

18:57.260 --> 18:59.100

18:59.100 --> 19:01.340
Show DS Drummond
how to use the coffee machine.

19:03.580 --> 19:06.740
OK. I'll, uh...I'll let them know.

19:06.740 --> 19:08.580
Uh, Sarge?

19:09.580 --> 19:11.860
Sophie's parents
are ready to identify the body.

19:13.940 --> 19:15.980
Another time, Lachie.

19:23.060 --> 19:24.980
'cause her sister lives out here.

19:28.860 --> 19:29.900
Um...

19:29.900 --> 19:32.060
..could you not track
Sophie's movement from her phone?

19:32.060 --> 19:35.620
She lost it on the boat, dropped
it overboard, taking a selfie.

19:38.820 --> 19:39.860
So...

19:41.340 --> 19:42.900
OK.
Um...

19:42.900 --> 19:44.300
Oh!
Yeah.

19:44.300 --> 19:46.620
Well, is it a savings account?
Sorry. (LAUGHS)

19:46.620 --> 19:48.820
Force of habit. Sorry.

19:48.820 --> 19:50.260
Alright.

19:50.260 --> 19:52.180
Oh. No.

19:54.180 --> 19:57.060
Alright. Well, let me know
how she goes with it.

OK.

20:23.940 --> 20:25.060

There must be security cameras
in the vicinity.

there wasn't any water in her lungs.

22:19.900 --> 22:22.380

22:22.380 --> 22:24.540
That she didn't drown.

It looks like she died
before her body entered the water.

that the bruising on her cheek

22:31.700 --> 22:33.100

our only child to Australia.

25:33.140 --> 25:34.140
I wish he'd never come.

25:34.140 --> 25:36.780
YOUNG MAN: Abigail. Simon.

25:36.780 --> 25:38.900
I am so sorry.

25:44.060 --> 25:45.860
Simon.

25:45.860 --> 25:47.220
This is my friend Oscar.

25:47.220 --> 25:49.900
He came to offer his condolences.
Uh-huh.

25:49.900 --> 25:51.260
These are Sophie's parents.

25:51.260 --> 25:54.780
Oh, God. I'm...I'm...I'm so sorry.

25:54.780 --> 25:57.140
Sophie was my girlfriend's flatmate.

25:57.140 --> 25:58.140
Erica Payton.

25:58.140 --> 26:00.900
ABIGAIL: Detective Sergeant Drummond
from the UK.

26:00.900 --> 26:03.420
Right. They said on the news
that they were sending someone.

26:05.220 --> 26:07.380
I have to get to my next job, but...

26:07.380 --> 26:10.940
..I'm...I'm so sorry to meet you
under these circumstances.

26:11.940 --> 26:13.620
Stay strong, bro.
Thanks.

26:16.220 --> 26:17.220
Alright.

26:18.220 --> 26:20.180
TOM: Please, guys, come in.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.380
Do the police know what's happened?

26:27.380 --> 26:29.500
They say...

26:29.500 --> 26:31.620
..that Sophie was murdered.

26:31.620 --> 26:32.620
What?

26:32.620 --> 26:33.620
Um...that's not...

26:33.620 --> 26:34.700
Jesus.
..common knowledge yet.

26:34.700 --> 26:36.260
How?
I'm sorry, we...
What happened?

26:36.260 --> 26:37.260
..we can't go into details.

26:37.260 --> 26:39.340
You've no idea
what might have happened to her?

26:39.340 --> 26:40.900
No. I...I don't know where she went.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.180
I didn't see her
after we got off the boat.

26:43.180 --> 26:44.700
Why did you split up?

26:44.700 --> 26:46.140
What?

26:46.140 --> 26:48.420
I'm sorry, I mean,
why did she go with Erica?

26:48.420 --> 26:49.420
Oh.

26:49.420 --> 26:51.060
Erica was pissed off with Oscar
about something,

26:51.060 --> 26:52.700
they'd had a row, and...

26:52.700 --> 26:54.220
..she'd had a bit to drink.

26:54.220 --> 26:55.260
Sophie?

26:55.260 --> 26:57.220
Erica.

26:57.220 --> 26:58.660
Sophie too.

26:58.660 --> 26:59.660
Not too much, though.

26:59.660 --> 27:02.820
I wouldn't have let her go
if I didn't think she was safe.

27:02.820 --> 27:05.140
MAN: Simon.

27:05.140 --> 27:07.940
Abigail.
I am so sorry for your loss.

27:07.940 --> 27:09.860
She was a wonderful girl.

27:09.860 --> 27:11.220
Thank you.

27:11.220 --> 27:12.500
She was murdered, Dad.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.340
Murdered?
SIMON: Yes.

27:14.340 --> 27:18.100
The autopsy showed that sh...
We...we can't talk about that.

27:18.100 --> 27:19.300
Hello.

27:19.300 --> 27:22.300
Uh, DS Max Drummond,
from the murder squad in London.

27:22.300 --> 27:24.140
You're investigating?

27:24.140 --> 27:27.180
Observing, as a courtesy.

27:27.180 --> 27:29.500
This is devastating.

27:29.500 --> 27:32.180
If I can be of any help, of course,
you're welcome to stay here.

27:32.180 --> 27:34.580
Thank you, but the hotel is fine.

27:34.580 --> 27:37.380
I don't know how long
I'll be staying.

27:37.380 --> 27:40.540
Sophie worked as an intern
at Lloyd's company.

27:40.540 --> 27:43.340
ABIGAIL: Thank you
for giving her that opportunity.

27:43.340 --> 27:44.900
How did that come about?

27:44.900 --> 27:48.540
She needed a job
and she asked if Dad could help.

27:48.540 --> 27:49.740
It's all perfectly legitimate.

27:49.740 --> 27:51.740
MAX: Oh, yeah. No, no.
I have no doubt.

27:51.740 --> 27:54.660
I'm just...interested
in how these things work.

27:54.660 --> 27:56.620
She was an incredible worker,

27:56.620 --> 27:58.700
a credit to you both.

27:59.700 --> 28:02.820
We're trying to get a sense
of what her life out here was like.

I'm sure Tom will tell you
everything he can.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.940
TOM: (SIGHS) She, um...

28:19.540 --> 28:21.060
..I loved her.

28:21.060 --> 28:23.380
I really loved her, Dad.

And she loved you.

I appreciate that.

And please don't hesitate

He told me to take as long as I need.

29:00.460 --> 29:03.780
Said that Don is ready to
take the lead on the trade agreement.

29:05.500 --> 29:07.940
I told him that won't be necessary,

29:07.940 --> 29:11.460
that while I'm here, I'll
see what I can do to push it along.

29:13.460 --> 29:16.980
Set up a meeting with my Australian
counterpart, will you, Ben?

29:16.980 --> 29:18.940
Oh, and get me five minutes
with Greg Hardy.

29:20.940 --> 29:22.300
Is that wise?

29:23.420 --> 29:25.860
Well,
as a minister of the British Crown,

29:25.860 --> 29:29.140
you shouldn't be seen to be taking
sides in the Australian election.

29:29.140 --> 29:31.020
He's an old family friend

29:31.020 --> 29:34.820
who there's a fair chance will be
the next Australian prime minister.

29:34.820 --> 29:37.820
No point passing up an opportunity.

29:37.820 --> 29:39.100
Thank you, Ben.

29:45.540 --> 29:47.620
BEN: I'll see you in the morning.

Well, I can't let Don do it.

29:59.860 --> 30:02.540
Our daughter is dead.
Don't you think I know that?

30:02.540 --> 30:03.940

30:03.940 --> 30:06.060
I don't know what else to do!

30:06.060 --> 30:07.940
I have to carry on.
WE have to carry on.

30:07.940 --> 30:10.340
I can't! Our daughter is dead!

We have to be strong.

30:21.140 --> 30:22.860
Or this'll destroy us.

I'm going to get ready for bed.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.780
Barely had time to sit down.

30:42.780 --> 30:44.660
Or pee.

30:44.660 --> 30:46.900
That is two different things, right?

30:46.900 --> 30:48.340
Oh, I miss you.

You've only been gone a day.
Yeah, and already I miss you.

30:51.820 --> 30:54.700
What does that tell you?
That you have separation issues.

30:54.700 --> 30:56.660
I told Tori that you're coming.

30:56.660 --> 30:59.060
Yeah, alright. I'll call her.

30:59.060 --> 31:00.580

31:00.580 --> 31:03.060
Martha won't play with me.
Well, then, play with someone else.

with my opposite number.

31:08.940 --> 31:11.660
And what's he like?
She.

31:11.660 --> 31:13.740
About my age. Quite attractive.

31:13.740 --> 31:16.740
Not very friendly.
Maybe she feels threatened by you.

31:16.740 --> 31:18.060
Maybe she just doesn't like me.

31:18.060 --> 31:19.700
Wouldn't be the only one.

31:19.700 --> 31:22.780
I didn't say I don't like you.

..let's not do this now.

Really?

Wasn't payback
'cause I didn't send a car for you?

You didn't send a car for me?

Anyway, forget about it.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.560
We're quits.

Except I really did fall asleep.

33:39.680 --> 33:40.840
Anyway.

33:40.840 --> 33:43.160
Erica had a row with her boyfriend.

33:43.160 --> 33:45.480
That's why she and Sophie
left the boat together.

33:45.480 --> 33:47.520
I know. How do you?

33:47.520 --> 33:49.160
Uh, Tom told me.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.880
You've met Tom?
Yeah.

33:50.880 --> 33:53.600

33:53.600 --> 33:55.440
You're not part
of this investigation.

33:55.440 --> 33:58.480
Sophie's parents
asked me to go with them.

33:58.480 --> 34:01.840
Oh, and I noticed
that Oscar had scratches on his hand

34:01.840 --> 34:03.640
and grazed knuckles.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.680
But you weren't investigating?

34:11.240 --> 34:12.520
Listen.

All I'm saying is,
it might be worth asking him about.

34:17.040 --> 34:19.960
Look - I know
you're more experienced than me,

34:19.960 --> 34:22.760
and obviously you've been told
that this is my first case.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.440
Only now, by you.

34:25.440 --> 34:28.920
It's a big case.

34:28.920 --> 34:30.920
Is there anything I can do to help?

34:30.920 --> 34:32.760
Yeah.

34:32.760 --> 34:34.440
Do nothing.

34:37.400 --> 34:39.960
OK, so, we don't have anything
from the ATM itself

34:39.960 --> 34:43.200
and only grainy images
from a CCTV camera at the bank,

34:43.200 --> 34:45.000
but if we take the image

34:45.000 --> 34:47.680
of the person withdrawing cash
from Sophie's account

34:47.680 --> 34:51.440
and marry it with footage
from a hotel in Martin Place...

34:51.440 --> 34:54.240

34:54.240 --> 34:57.200
Have we checked whether Sophie's

Sorry, boss. That's my fault.

Uh, Lachie, talk to her bank.
Yeah.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.360

the witness interviews?

35:10.360 --> 35:12.360
I'm about halfway through.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.120
And what have you learnt so far?

35:15.440 --> 35:18.280
Australians pronounce 'party'
'pardy'.

35:18.280 --> 35:19.360
It's really annoying.

35:19.360 --> 35:21.640

an hour or so.

35:32.680 --> 35:34.560
I am about to leave for Melbourne.

35:34.560 --> 35:37.640
This won't take long.
Is there somewhere quiet we can go?

35:37.640 --> 35:39.400
Sure.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.480
Oh, uh, just the two of us.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Shouldn't you tell the Pom
that we're heading out?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I'll tell him when we get back.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.280
Alright.

35:55.440 --> 35:57.520
He'd only want to come with us.

Don't you ever lock your car?

36:02.440 --> 36:04.160
Not in the police car. Fuck, no.

36:04.160 --> 36:06.240
You want to be in London.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.600

Where do we expect to find Erica?

36:12.720 --> 36:14.520
At home.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.800
At the unit she shared with Sophie.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.120
Sophie was your daughter.

36:20.400 --> 36:23.840
She was your child, not Simon's.

No.

How long have YOU known?

36:32.120 --> 36:36.080

I had always had my suspicions.

36:36.080 --> 36:37.880
She looked like you.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.880
A little of me.

36:39.880 --> 36:41.480
Nothing of Simon.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.600
Did you never think she might be?

36:46.600 --> 36:48.400
When I heard,

36:48.400 --> 36:50.800
I suppose I did the maths.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.600
But I figured
you would have said something.

36:52.600 --> 36:55.400
You were back in Sydney with
your wife. I couldn't see the point.

36:56.560 --> 36:59.400
And Simon was so happy
to have a child.

37:00.440 --> 37:03.120
He never knew about us.

37:03.120 --> 37:05.480
But you're not sure, though?

37:05.480 --> 37:07.600
Whether she was mine.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.720
No, I am.

37:11.480 --> 37:16.000
Last month, I was at
a ministerial meeting in Singapore.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.080
Sophie flew up to see me.

37:19.440 --> 37:22.280
SOPHIE: I went to a doctor.

37:22.280 --> 37:26.240
She ran lots of tests. It turns out
I have something called HCM.

37:26.240 --> 37:29.000
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.360
And what's that?

37:30.360 --> 37:33.280
It's when your heart muscles
are abnormally thick,

37:33.280 --> 37:35.320
meaning the heart
has to work a lot harder

37:35.320 --> 37:37.880
to push the same amount of blood
around the body.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.440
Is it serious?

37:39.440 --> 37:40.840
SOPHIE: Can be.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.920
Might be nothing.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.440
So you don't have it?

37:45.720 --> 37:47.360
Does Dad?

37:47.360 --> 37:49.200
No.

37:49.200 --> 37:52.440
Because it's a genetic condition.

37:52.440 --> 37:54.840
If I have it,
one of my parents must.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.480
Dad isn't my dad, is he?

38:05.160 --> 38:06.520
Darling, there...

38:07.520 --> 38:08.640
..there must be some mistake.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.800
SOPHIE: That's what I thought too.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.440
And then...

38:12.440 --> 38:13.840
..I saw this.

38:18.240 --> 38:21.000
You'd mentioned
he was an old friend of the family.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.880
I googled him.

38:24.160 --> 38:27.480
Nine months before I was born,
Greg Hardy was an employment lawyer

38:27.480 --> 38:30.080
seconded to the TUC in London.

38:30.080 --> 38:32.440
Just as a young married researcher

38:32.440 --> 38:35.920
was beginning her career
at Westminster.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.520
(SNIFFS)

38:43.520 --> 38:46.640
He's my father, isn't he? (SOBS)

38:47.920 --> 38:50.200
Sweetheart.

38:50.200 --> 38:51.960
No. (KISSES)

38:56.000 --> 38:58.080
So I am Sophie's father?

38:58.080 --> 39:01.360
No. Simon is, and always will be.

39:01.360 --> 39:02.880
Then why are you telling me?

39:02.880 --> 39:05.800
ABIGAIL:
I thought you had a right to know.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.120
And I thought...

39:07.120 --> 39:09.800
..that I should warn you.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.720
In case she told anyone else.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.640
Erica?

39:25.040 --> 39:26.280
She's not picking up.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.160
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

39:29.160 --> 39:31.720
Where's the Pom gone?
(WOMAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

39:31.720 --> 39:34.160
Remember, I'm here.
(SIGHS)

39:34.160 --> 39:36.640
MAX: Oh, thank you so much, Dima.
You've been very helpful.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.320
(SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Bye-bye, now.

39:38.320 --> 39:40.160
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.160
MEG: What were you doing?

39:41.160 --> 39:43.400
I was just having a chat
with Sophie's neighbour.

39:43.400 --> 39:46.400
Lovely woman.
Fled Poland in the '60s.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.360
Still has a heavy accent.

39:48.360 --> 39:50.000
And that's of interest why?

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
Well, she was saying - you know, at
least, I...I think she was saying -

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
that the girls had a break-in,
about a week ago.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
You can't question people.
You don't have any jurisdiction.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.720
I was just making conversation.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.360
Interesting, though, isn't it?

40:02.360 --> 40:04.840
It may have nothing to do
with Sophie's murder.

40:04.840 --> 40:06.240
No.

40:06.240 --> 40:07.960
But we should check it out. (SIGHS)

40:07.960 --> 40:09.920
See if they filed a report.

40:09.920 --> 40:10.920
What's her name, again?

40:10.920 --> 40:12.440
Erm...

40:12.440 --> 40:14.640
..Dima Moiseenko.

40:25.680 --> 40:26.800
Erica?

40:26.800 --> 40:28.560
Police entering!

40:28.560 --> 40:30.680
Are you home?

40:33.640 --> 40:35.760
What did SHE want?

40:37.600 --> 40:40.040
To tell me Sophie was my daughter.

40:42.400 --> 40:45.720
Did you mention
that Sophie had already told you?

40:45.720 --> 40:49.880
I thought it best
she remain ignorant of that fact.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.160
I told you
this could become a problem.

40:51.160 --> 40:54.360
I said I'd fix it.
And I said, "Don't tell me how."

40:55.880 --> 40:57.720
Oh, Christ. Don't tell me how.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.400
MAN: It's fine.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.200
It's finished with.

41:18.800 --> 41:21.440
PAEA: She's gone home to Tasmania
for a couple of days.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.560
Left a note for the cleaner.

41:23.560 --> 41:25.520
They've got a cleaner?

41:25.520 --> 41:27.240
That's gen Z for you.
(PHONE RINGS)

41:27.240 --> 41:29.960
Well, we told her
we'd need to talk to her again.

41:29.960 --> 41:31.080
(PHONE RINGS)

41:31.080 --> 41:32.320
Go ahead, Lachie.

41:32.320 --> 41:35.440
LACHIE: Yeah, so I've
got Sophie's statements up here.

41:35.440 --> 41:36.720
And, yeah, that $500 withdrawal

41:36.720 --> 41:39.600
WAS the last activity
out of her cash account.

41:39.600 --> 41:40.600
And savings?

41:40.600 --> 41:42.440
LACHIE: Savings...

41:42.440 --> 41:44.520
Give me a sec.

41:45.520 --> 41:47.280
Holy shit.

41:47.280 --> 41:51.800
Yesterday, there was a transfer
out of her account for $20,000

41:51.800 --> 41:53.320
to E.G. Payton.

41:53.320 --> 41:54.560
Erica.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.520
Has she taken her passport?

41:58.520 --> 42:01.400
You don't need it to go interstate.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.720
So it should be here, shouldn't it?

42:03.720 --> 42:05.160
Lachie.

42:05.160 --> 42:06.440
Ring border security

42:06.440 --> 42:09.520
and check whether Erica Payton's
left the country.

42:09.520 --> 42:12.400
Also the airlines,
flights to Tasmania.

42:18.840 --> 42:21.160
It's a good thing
you didn't have her accounts frozen.

42:22.640 --> 42:25.000
Now we have a person of interest,
don't we?

42:34.000 --> 42:35.920
Anna told me about the separation.

42:35.920 --> 42:38.840
Uh, I wouldn't call it that.
WOMAN: Oh. She did.

42:38.840 --> 42:40.720
Please get in touch.

42:40.720 --> 42:41.760
Were you watching it?

42:41.760 --> 42:43.800
I need you at home tonight
with Oscar.

42:43.800 --> 42:46.240
I understand this is your first
investigation, Detective Sergeant.

42:46.240 --> 42:48.440
Sideline me so that
YOU'RE her only point of contact?

42:48.440 --> 42:49.760
No, stop.

42:49.760 --> 42:52.240
The PM is keeping you
off the front page.

42:52.240 --> 42:53.760
There are calls for his resignation.

42:53.760 --> 42:56.400
ABIGAIL: If the PM does go,

42:56.400 --> 42:59.320
I may be one of the contenders
to replace him.
