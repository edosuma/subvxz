WEBVTT

00:08.442 --> 00:10.078
<i>Here we are.</i>

00:10.178 --> 00:12.613
<i>95,000 square feet
of government storage space</i>

00:12.713 --> 00:15.383
<i>surrounded by 60 acres of
protected wilderness.</i>

00:15.483 --> 00:17.385
This place is a fortress
built inside a mountain.

00:17.485 --> 00:20.088
No one gets in,
nothing gets out.

00:21.021 --> 00:24.225
Pretty impressive, huh?
No perimeter fence, I see.

00:24.325 --> 00:27.628
Sir, the entrance to this
storage facility is fortified

00:27.728 --> 00:29.663
with four feet of
reinforced concrete.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.232
Not to mention two
state-of-the-art vault doors

00:31.332 --> 00:34.768
that each require two-factor
biometric authentication.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.904
But no fence.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.441
Is there a problem,
petty officer?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.243
No, sir. It's just
when Senator Edison--

00:42.343 --> 00:44.078
Addison.
When your boss

00:44.178 --> 00:46.447
called my boss about
a routine security check,

00:46.547 --> 00:48.516
I didn't expect
the Spanish Inquisition.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.718
Nobody expects
the Spanish Inquisition.

00:50.818 --> 00:53.687
And just when I thought you
didn't have a sense of humor.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.956
Excuse me?
Monty Python.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.225
Is that your CEO?

00:57.325 --> 00:59.793
I'll just get the
door.

01:02.796 --> 01:05.333
What's in there that requires
congressional oversight anyway?

01:05.433 --> 01:07.435
That's need-to-know.
And you don't.

01:14.108 --> 01:15.509
What the hell?

01:17.378 --> 01:19.113
Are you okay, sir?

01:20.548 --> 01:22.082
Sir, can you hear me?

01:23.351 --> 01:24.585
Stay back.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.694
Sir?

01:36.897 --> 01:38.065
He's dead.

01:39.032 --> 01:40.934
This is Chief
Petty Officer Thompson

01:41.034 --> 01:42.470
requesting--

01:42.570 --> 01:44.272
No. No, don't hurt me.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.374
Don't hurt me.
Please, don't hurt me.

02:22.676 --> 02:25.746
It's a, it's a
Man-Time Monday.

02:25.846 --> 02:26.947
It's a juice...
All right, give me that.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.148
A juice hang.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.083
McGEE: Delilah.
Hey, hon. It's me.

02:30.184 --> 02:32.152
Just dropped
the kids off at school.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.121
I'm stuck in the parking lot.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.823
Again.

02:35.923 --> 02:39.227
Anyway, I forgot the permission
slip for the fall festival,

02:39.327 --> 02:41.161
so if you could grab that
off the kitchen counter

02:41.262 --> 02:42.996
that would-- Whoa, hey!

02:43.096 --> 02:44.265
Thanks, bro!
Jackass!

02:44.365 --> 02:46.267
Sorry, honey.

02:46.367 --> 02:49.069
Some...
..."bro dad"

02:49.169 --> 02:50.438
pulled out in front of me.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.572
I swear, some of these parents

02:51.672 --> 02:53.607
can be a little...

02:54.508 --> 02:55.709
...much.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.578
Got to go.
Bye, babe.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.413
Morning, Tim.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.849
Morning...
Carter.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.484
Maddie's dad.

03:03.584 --> 03:04.785
Uh...

03:04.885 --> 03:06.186
We met the last time
I was traffic volunteer.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.788
Um, should I get
going here?

03:07.888 --> 03:08.922
Ah, no, that's okay, man.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.291
They can go around.
Come on.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.559
Thank you.
Come on.

03:11.659 --> 03:14.161
Hey, I-I-I wanted to
give you one of these.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.029
Here you go. Uh...

03:17.064 --> 03:17.965
McGEE:
"Man-Time Monday"?

03:18.065 --> 03:19.433
It's an
informal hang

03:19.533 --> 03:20.901
for school dads
at a local juice bar.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.936
I have a deal with the manager
to get five percent off.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.071
You should come.

03:24.171 --> 03:26.173
We dads got to
stick together.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.543
McGEE: Well, you know, I would.
But I, I got work.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.379
Oh, that's right,
you're an NCIS agent.

03:31.479 --> 03:34.348
Me and the other
dads would love to hear

03:34.448 --> 03:35.616
some cool crime stories.
I bet.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.050
Yeah, they really would.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.786
Actually,
that may be one now.
Huh? Oh, okay.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.521
Come on, Margie, let's go.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.523
Yes, you.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.392
Hey...
You.

03:44.492 --> 03:45.459
Can I go?
One sec, one second.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.928
White car,
your move.

03:48.028 --> 03:51.865
Lady in blue,
coming thru. Come on.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.201
Severely wrinkled digits.

03:54.302 --> 03:55.669
Mm.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.238
Rules out using a
fingerprint scanner for ID.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.740
I'd settle on a cause of death.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.809
There's nothing obvious here,
but the fingers

04:01.909 --> 04:03.511
do suggest
extreme dehydration.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.245
From what?
You know, it's hard to say.

04:05.346 --> 04:08.282
But rigor mortis has passed,
so this man has been dead

04:08.382 --> 04:09.683
for at least 36 hours.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.485
Well, that's a long time
to be stuck down here.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.821
No wonder his missing buddy
was so eager to escape.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.856
Who gets themselves into
a government storage bunker

04:15.956 --> 04:17.991
but then can't get themself out?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.560
Thieves.
Thieves.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.529
Thieves who aren't
very good at their job.

04:21.629 --> 04:22.996
Sorry I'm late, guys.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.334
I got held hostage
by a, uh, chatty school dad.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.769
Discussing minivans
and comparing dad bods?

04:28.869 --> 04:30.638
No, we prefer the term
"father figures."

04:30.738 --> 04:32.673
But, uh, no. I wish.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.174
Unfortunately, this guy
just wanted to talk about

04:34.274 --> 04:36.410
the usual-- you know,
dead bodies, murder.

04:36.510 --> 04:37.945
The job. Yeah.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.480
People do treat us like
their own personal episode

04:39.580 --> 04:40.948
of <i>Dateline.</i>
If I have to hear

04:41.048 --> 04:44.284
another theory about
the O.J. trial...

04:44.385 --> 04:46.019
McGEE:
Exactly.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.389
Talking shop gets old.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.023
People are fascinated by death.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.225
I always end up
changing the subject.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.394
Yeah? To what?

04:53.494 --> 04:54.662
Well, anything, you know?

04:54.762 --> 04:56.364
Uh, kids. Sports. Weather.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.498
You mean, small talk?

04:57.598 --> 04:58.599
Mm-hmm.
I don't know.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.200
That sounds worse than death.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.372
The second intruder
must have been waiting for us

05:04.472 --> 05:05.706
to open the door.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.808
I never saw him coming, sir.
What about

05:07.908 --> 05:10.678
Beltway Bob over here?
Legislative Aide Meeks.

05:10.778 --> 05:11.779
Wasn't much help.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.647
But he did say
the man who hit me

05:13.747 --> 05:15.516
was a white male
with medium build

05:15.616 --> 05:16.884
and a slight limp.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.819
Whatever that means.
Means we can put out a BOLO.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.388
I don't understand it.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.356
When we arrived, there were
no signs of a break-in.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.257
No alarms.
No lights.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.494
And even if the intruders
got in with proper ID,

05:26.594 --> 05:28.896
the security panel would have
still shown an entry event.

05:28.996 --> 05:32.099
Any idea what they were after?
No, sir.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.835
And the inner vault door
was still closed and locked.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.637
We're gonna need it unlocked.
I'll call you back.

05:36.737 --> 05:37.871
Excuse me.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.707
NCIS does not have authorization

05:39.807 --> 05:41.108
to enter this
storage facility.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.910
This is a murder investigation.
And the contents

05:43.010 --> 05:45.345
of this vault are a matter
of national security.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.180
Says who?
Me.

05:47.881 --> 05:50.217
And my boss.
Senator Addison.

05:50.317 --> 05:51.385
I see.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.053
Would that be
the Senator Addison

05:53.153 --> 05:55.489
who's currently under
investigation for taking bribes?

05:55.589 --> 05:57.425
Those charges
are totally false.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.627
Well, the obstruction
of justice charge won't be.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.995
We're going
inside that vault. Fine.

06:02.095 --> 06:05.365
But whatever you see in there,
it stays quiet.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.973
Lead the way, Nic Cage.

06:14.675 --> 06:15.943
<i>National Treasure?</i>

06:16.043 --> 06:19.713
Finds a hidden vault
full of government gold?

06:22.215 --> 06:24.017
Whoa.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.189
I don't think we're
looking at gold.

06:29.289 --> 06:31.625
At least not the kind
that you can spend.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.260
You got to be kidding me.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.996
McGEE:
What do we got here?
Chemicals? Drugs?

06:39.833 --> 06:42.936
Hmm. Ugh. Oh...

06:43.036 --> 06:44.137
Nope.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.039
That's cheese.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.075
Yeah, and the barrel
is filled with it.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.680
They all are.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.927
I-I assure you, NCIS will be
discreet, Senator.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.862
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.731
Uh, appreciate the call.

07:10.831 --> 07:13.967
Will someone explain to me
why the hell I'm getting

07:14.067 --> 07:17.638
angry calls on my personal cell
about cheese?

07:17.738 --> 07:19.306
Bet that's a new
sentence for you.

07:19.406 --> 07:20.708
One I would rather not repeat.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.342
Well, Director,
early this morning two men

07:22.442 --> 07:25.245
were found inside
a government storage vault.

07:25.345 --> 07:26.614
They apparently broke in

07:26.714 --> 07:28.115
just to find themselves
trapped inside.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.450
Was our security that good,
or the thieves that bad?

07:30.551 --> 07:31.752
Well, that's a good question,

07:31.852 --> 07:33.487
especially given what was
inside the vault.

07:33.587 --> 07:36.223
Yeah, and this is
where it gets weird.

07:36.323 --> 07:37.791
McGEE: Turns out,
this bunker is one

07:37.891 --> 07:40.427
of several across the country
where the U.S. government

07:40.528 --> 07:44.498
stores 1.4 billion pounds
of surplus cheese.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.967
I'm sure they have a reason.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.301
Many reasons, actually.

07:48.401 --> 07:50.804
Trade disputes.
Declining dairy consumption.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.339
Overproduction.

07:52.439 --> 07:55.809
So the U.S. government is
subsidizing the dairy industry.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.011
It costs the taxpayers
a pretty penny.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.913
Hence the phone calls.
Congress doesn't want to

08:00.013 --> 08:02.049
advertise the program.
Or their personal involvement,

08:02.149 --> 08:04.384
since it usually involves
lobbyists and kickbacks.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.787
In other words,
this cheese stinks.
I was gonna say

08:06.887 --> 08:08.889
it's "no gouda."

08:13.460 --> 08:15.663
Yes, Senator.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.430
Y-Yes.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.368
Cheese puns?
To the director?

08:21.468 --> 08:23.203
I think he appreciated it.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.471
Well, I'd
appreciate answers.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.439
Starting with
why the hell our thieves

08:26.540 --> 08:27.841
were after cheese
in the first place.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.877
Maybe cheese wasn't
the intended target.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.079
According to
the security record,

08:32.179 --> 08:34.548
vault B-117 had cheese.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.750
But six miles away, P-117

08:36.850 --> 08:38.919
had a different kind of
government surplus.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.053
Weapons.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.021
McGEE: Experimental
grenade launchers,

08:41.121 --> 08:42.055
to be exact.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.557
Worth more than dairy.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.693
Well, not only our cheese
bandits got locked inside.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.995
It was the wrong vault.
Hope they don't quit
their day jobs.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.631
Speaking of day jobs,
let's do ours. Right.

08:50.731 --> 08:54.568
I will add extra security
to vault P-117.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.503
Cheddar safe than sorry.

08:57.470 --> 09:00.007
Okay, that's...
Wow.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.376
There we go.

09:03.476 --> 09:05.078
Much better.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.647
Sounds like progress, doc.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.582
Practice makes progress.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.651
It took 16 saline injections,

09:10.751 --> 09:12.686
but I finally got
a usable print.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.823
And our vault victim is...

09:16.624 --> 09:18.391
...Tyson Perkins.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.827
Long arrest record.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.195
Includes breaking
and entering,

09:22.295 --> 09:23.196
grand larceny...

09:23.296 --> 09:24.331
He's a career thief.

09:24.431 --> 09:25.799
Picked the wrong career. Yeah.

09:25.899 --> 09:26.700
Known associates?

09:26.800 --> 09:27.935
Well, it's a long list.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.637
This guy's worked
with all the greats.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.405
He's like the Forrest Gump
of criminals.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.675
So no help in IDing
his missing partner.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.076
What about cause of death?

09:36.176 --> 09:38.612
Well, like 65% of
the world's population,

09:38.712 --> 09:41.749
this man is
lactose intolerant.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.116
Didn't know that was fatal.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.618
It's not. Usually.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.687
But his food allergy
was unusual.

09:46.787 --> 09:47.921
You see,

09:48.021 --> 09:49.056
dairy particles
got into his airways

09:49.156 --> 09:50.223
which caused bronchospasms.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.424
Again,

09:51.524 --> 09:53.160
very rare,
but not typically fatal.

09:53.260 --> 09:57.230
Unless you're trapped in
a sealed room with no fresh air. Exactly.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.467
The added stress triggered
an underlying thyroid condition

10:00.567 --> 10:02.870
which caused
the extreme dehydration

10:02.970 --> 10:05.038
until, eventually,
his body gave out completely

10:05.138 --> 10:07.374
and there was nothing
he could fondue.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.679
You and Knight are rubbing off
on each other.

10:11.779 --> 10:14.081
:
What? What?

10:14.181 --> 10:16.083
No, no one's,
no one's rubbing...

10:16.183 --> 10:17.450
things.

10:18.218 --> 10:21.955
I also found this.
This is pityriasis capitis.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.425
Dandruff?

10:25.525 --> 10:26.794
It was all over his clothing.

10:26.894 --> 10:28.028
But...

10:28.128 --> 10:29.663
this man does not
have a dry scalp.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.565
So it might belong
to his partner.
Kasie ran DNA.

10:32.666 --> 10:35.135
There's no hits.
Well, we can
update our BOLO.

10:35.235 --> 10:39.606
Right, so NCIS is now looking
for a white male, medium build,

10:39.707 --> 10:44.644
with a possible limp
and... flakes.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.115
Wow.

10:48.215 --> 10:51.484
Proper data validation.
Reduced user freedom.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.420
It's beautiful.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.089
And this proprietary
encryption algorithm

10:56.189 --> 10:58.658
actually improves
program security.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.961
Mm. Rare.
Oh, so rare.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.629
Mm.
So boring.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.033
How long have you been
sitting there?

11:06.133 --> 11:08.501
Long enough to question
your taste in art.

11:08.601 --> 11:12.005
What is all this?
Oh, this is root code.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.274
Used in the storage bunker
security software.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.976
It controls the vault doors.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.878
Oh, so it's how
our bad guys got in.
Actually, no.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.013
This software is unhackable

11:20.113 --> 11:23.150
because the person
who wrote it is an artist.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.417
Genius.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.552
A digital da Vinci.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.120
Ooh.
Okay, so...

11:27.220 --> 11:28.889
how did our thieves
get into the vault

11:28.989 --> 11:30.157
without tripping the alarm?

11:30.257 --> 11:31.591
Well, it turns out
they had a key.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.793
And not just any key.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.094
Remember,
there was no record

11:34.194 --> 11:36.029
of anybody
entering that vault.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.798
Which means someone had to
tamper with the root code.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.099
And the only way to do that

11:39.199 --> 11:40.834
is with the original
encryption key.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.702
That sounds important.
It is.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.637
Because the only
person who has it

11:44.738 --> 11:46.539
is the one who created it--

11:46.639 --> 11:47.841
Our digital da Vinci.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.076
McGEE:
Which means the thieves

11:49.176 --> 11:50.844
either stole
the key from him...

11:50.944 --> 11:52.913
Or da Vinci willingly
gave it to them,

11:53.013 --> 11:54.447
which makes him an accomplice.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.715
Yep.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.785
And the
security company

11:57.885 --> 11:59.920
just sent over
the personnel file

12:00.020 --> 12:02.322
for their lead
software engineer.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.291
Meet our digital da Vinci,

12:04.391 --> 12:05.759
Carter Landegraff.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.627
You've got to be kidding me.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.496
You know this man?

12:09.596 --> 12:12.032
Yeah, he's a dad
at my kids' school.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.934
Well,
he's also a genius.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.036
And now a robbery suspect.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.771
No, no, that-that
can't be right.

12:17.871 --> 12:21.408
Well, I say we find him
and ask him.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.675
Actually,
you know what?

12:22.776 --> 12:23.844
We don't need
to find him.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.245
I know exactly
where he is.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.617
Looks like that invite
came in handy.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.920
Chatty school dad
involved in a

12:33.020 --> 12:34.822
deadly attempt at
robbery? I don't know.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.390
Well, the best criminals are
the ones you don't see coming.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.226
McGEE:
Yep.
Whoa! Oh, wait.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.693
Sorry, my dudes.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.263
Wait.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.764
Uh... Tim.

12:44.865 --> 12:48.001
Johnny and, uh,
Morgan's dad, right?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.269
Scott's dad?

12:49.369 --> 12:50.637
Yeah, yeah, Owen.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.039
Good to see you again, man.
Good to see you.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.673
Uh, by the way,

12:53.773 --> 12:55.642
don't go in there.
That, uh, chatty dad,

12:55.742 --> 12:56.944
Carter, he's inside.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.611
He will talk your ear off.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.580
Yeah, we hope so.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.950
Blueberry cream.
Extra cream.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.217
:
You're the best, Sam.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.553
Thanks.
I'll put it
on your tab.

13:06.653 --> 13:07.654
Hey Tim!

13:07.754 --> 13:08.788
You came!

13:08.889 --> 13:10.590
And you brought a friend. Cool.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.559
Sam.

13:12.659 --> 13:13.961
Uh...

13:14.061 --> 13:15.896
Two super fruit smoothies
for my new best friends.

13:15.996 --> 13:16.930
On me.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.698
What do you guys want?

13:18.798 --> 13:20.133
Acai? Goji?

13:20.233 --> 13:25.238
We want to talk
to you back at NCIS.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.706
Now.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.376
Tim, is this a joke?

13:30.810 --> 13:33.847
Of course it's a joke.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.348
Uh...

13:35.448 --> 13:36.816
Okay, not-not a joke.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.551
Um, sh-should I call my family

13:38.651 --> 13:39.853
and tell them
I'll be late for dinner?

13:39.953 --> 13:41.654
I'm-I'm sure
this won't take long.

13:41.754 --> 13:43.323
I'm not.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.225
All right. Well, do you mind
if I put this away first?

13:45.325 --> 13:46.860
I promised my daughter
I'd bring home balloons.

13:46.960 --> 13:47.961
Just parked right over there.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.329
Yeah, just make it quick.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.663
Okay. Yeah, balloons are

13:50.763 --> 13:51.831
a big thing
with my daughter. I rem...

14:12.886 --> 14:15.388
How's he doing?
He's still shaken up
from the blast.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.790
But, thankfully,
no one was hurt.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.326
We got a cause yet?

14:19.426 --> 14:20.827
No cameras outside
of the juice bar,

14:20.928 --> 14:22.996
but we did find this
melted onto the gas tank.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.631
Explosive device.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.366
Car's being towed into NCIS.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.435
School dad is
lucky to be alive.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.204
I knew I shouldn't have ignored
that check engine light.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.173
He does know
that minivans

14:33.273 --> 14:35.075
don't spontaneously
combust, right?

14:35.175 --> 14:36.977
Is this some
kind of act?

14:37.077 --> 14:39.179
I don't even
know anymore.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.581
I mean, vault
robberies, car bombs...

14:41.681 --> 14:43.050
Dad is into
something bad.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.385
Yeah, I'm beginning to
think our friendly chat

14:45.485 --> 14:47.720
in the drop-off line
wasn't so friendly after all.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.422
He was asking
about NCIS.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.424
Maybe fishing for info

14:51.524 --> 14:53.093
on our trapped thieves?
School parents.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.561
Can't say that I miss

14:54.661 --> 14:56.563
the days of trying to
decipher their motives.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.331
As the head of a federal agency,
you must've been popular.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.367
Well, I like to think
it was my charm

15:00.467 --> 15:02.202
and not parents simply
looking for favors.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.770
How could you tell
the difference?

15:03.870 --> 15:05.138
Time, Agent McGee.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.606
Given the chance,

15:06.706 --> 15:09.376
people eventually show you
who they really are.

15:17.017 --> 15:20.287
Uh, look, I-I don't
mean to sound naive...

15:20.387 --> 15:21.721
Too late.

15:21.821 --> 15:24.591
...but does NCIS think
I did something wrong?

15:29.262 --> 15:30.430
McGEE:
Look familiar?

15:30.530 --> 15:31.831
Oh, that's my code.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.067
For vault access control
and physical security.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.235
Security that failed.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.769
Two thieves broke
into a vault

15:36.869 --> 15:38.838
without tripping
the alarm. Wow.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.173
Well, you know it wasn't
a software failure.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.541
My code is...

15:41.641 --> 15:43.810
It's unhackable.
Oh, we know.
No, it's...

15:43.910 --> 15:44.877
it's a work of art.

15:44.978 --> 15:46.379
:
You think so?

15:46.479 --> 15:47.747
McGEE:
Actually, I'm dying to know

15:47.847 --> 15:49.516
how you, uh, hide
your data structures.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.385
It is a funny story.
Yeah,
one that can wait.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.454
Our point is,
someone got into that vault

15:54.554 --> 15:56.789
without leaving a record.

15:57.924 --> 16:00.693
Well, that would require
altering the root code...

16:01.628 --> 16:04.531
...and they would need
the original encryption key.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.033
And I would have had
to have given them

16:06.133 --> 16:07.767
my original algorithm.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.569
So...
Did you?

16:09.669 --> 16:11.704
Of course not.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.773
The algorithm is proprietary

16:13.873 --> 16:15.308
and I'm an independent contractor.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.476
I would never give away
my livelihood.

16:16.576 --> 16:17.610
Especially not to thieves.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.346
And outside
a safe-deposit box,

16:19.446 --> 16:20.747
the only place I store
my original work

16:20.847 --> 16:23.383
is in a hidden and locked...

16:24.384 --> 16:25.752
...partition on my, um...

16:27.887 --> 16:28.888
Huh.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.657
There a problem?

16:32.925 --> 16:34.161
No. No.

16:34.261 --> 16:35.495
Okay, 'cause I'll be
honest with you.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.564
Sounds like there's a problem.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.168
Um...

16:41.268 --> 16:42.635
I lent my laptop to a friend.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.771
Uh, it was
an emergency situation.

16:44.871 --> 16:47.440
But I created
a secure partition, so...

16:47.540 --> 16:48.908
This friend have a name?

16:51.344 --> 16:52.879
I don't want to get them
in trouble.

16:52.979 --> 16:54.481
Wow.
You're a good friend.

16:54.581 --> 16:55.848
Thank you.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.850
But if it was my
minivan that blew up,

16:57.950 --> 17:00.553
I'd be less worried
about my friends

17:00.653 --> 17:03.423
and more worried about me
and my family.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.095
I'll tell you everything.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.296
Um...

17:09.396 --> 17:11.131
I recently lost
some money, okay?

17:11.231 --> 17:13.466
A lot of it, actually.
In-in cryptocurrency?

17:13.566 --> 17:14.801
Yeah, volatile market.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.569
Yes.
But I didn't lose the money

17:16.669 --> 17:18.105
due to supply and demand.

17:18.205 --> 17:19.939
I lost it because it was stolen.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.974
One day it was there,
the day next it was gone.

17:22.075 --> 17:22.909
Everything.

17:23.009 --> 17:24.177
McGEE:
How's that?

17:24.277 --> 17:25.978
You're a coder
for a security company.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.680
True. But everybody has
their blind spots.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.382
And even I don't fully
understand the blockchain.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.650
When I went to the police

17:30.750 --> 17:32.552
with decentralized assets
and full nodes,

17:32.652 --> 17:34.887
their eyes just
kind of glazed over.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.524
Like his are doing
right now.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.393
Hey, hey, I understand
the blockchain.

17:40.493 --> 17:41.828
Mostly.
Well, luckily,

17:41.928 --> 17:43.396
I have a close friend
with connections.

17:43.496 --> 17:44.697
He agreed to help me
get the money back.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.633
Let me guess.
By using your laptop?

17:46.733 --> 17:48.868
Hello?
Secure partition.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.002
Just give us a name.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.941
My friend is
Kingston Reinhardt.

17:56.209 --> 17:59.078
The Kingston Reinhardt?
The gangster?

17:59.179 --> 18:00.680
I've heard of his supposed
legal troubles.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.315
But I swear,
Rhino's really a good guy.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.917
Yeah. Right up until
he took your laptop

18:05.017 --> 18:06.719
and used it
to commit a robbery.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.788
Yeah, and when that went wrong,
he tried to kill you.

18:08.888 --> 18:12.659
You think...
You think he double-crossed me?

18:13.726 --> 18:16.696
Guys, no. Rhino wouldn't
do that. He wouldn't lie.

18:16.796 --> 18:17.664
Why not?

18:17.764 --> 18:19.566
Well, friends don't do that.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.603
Right?

18:27.140 --> 18:31.244
I am pretty sure Carter
and Reinhardt are not friends.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.745
I mean, look at this.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.582
Just think if Carter's
daughter had been inside.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.950
Yeah, I'd rather not.
From what I can tell,

18:38.050 --> 18:40.153
the explosive was made
using all generic parts.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.788
Nothing remotely traceable.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.423
Someone knew
what they were doing.

18:43.523 --> 18:44.724
You mean, like a known gangster?

18:44.824 --> 18:46.926
Ah.
Kingston Reinhardt.

18:47.026 --> 18:50.697
Mid-level street enforcer with
a rap sheet a mile long.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.632
Weapons theft,
weapons trafficking,

18:52.732 --> 18:54.066
weapons use...

18:54.167 --> 18:57.136
Mm. A bad guy
who likes guns. Yeah.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.971
So why does our
school dad like him?

18:59.071 --> 19:00.240
Well, Carter said

19:00.340 --> 19:02.175
they met at an underground
poker game. They...

19:02.275 --> 19:03.710
they really hit it off.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.312
School dad is also
a card shark?

19:05.412 --> 19:06.713
I guess parents have hobbies.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.215
Looks like this hobby
double-crossed him,

19:08.315 --> 19:09.416
then tried to kill him.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.818
Yeah, Carter's husband
and daughter

19:11.918 --> 19:13.586
have been put into
protective custody

19:13.686 --> 19:14.787
until we find
the man responsible.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.556
How's that going,
by the way?

19:16.656 --> 19:17.690
I was hoping
you had something.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.892
Oh, you mean like...

19:19.992 --> 19:21.961
a known address or a vehicle?

19:22.061 --> 19:24.497
Maybe a bank account
we could use to track him?

19:24.597 --> 19:26.098
You have that?
No!

19:26.199 --> 19:29.269
Kingston Reinhardt is a criminal
who lives in the shadows.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.803
Off the grid. Underground.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.473
Guy's a ghost.
In more ways than one.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.975
Our gangster is dead.
What? Says who?

19:36.075 --> 19:39.178
Says someone who does business
with the Reinhardt family.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.447
See, unlike McGee,

19:40.547 --> 19:42.415
I actually make small talk
with my friends,

19:42.515 --> 19:44.917
so I reached out,
she texted back.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.086
And, apparently, our very bad
man had a very bad heart attack

19:47.186 --> 19:49.256
early yesterday morning.
That would mean

19:49.356 --> 19:52.959
he died and tried to blow up
Carter on the same day?

19:53.059 --> 19:55.094
That's a heck
of a coincidence.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.529
Or maybe
instant karma?

19:56.629 --> 19:58.164
Or maybe we're
missing something.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.999
We need to take
a look at the body.

20:01.301 --> 20:05.572
My friend might have
a problem with that.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.509
NCIS wants to perform
an impromptu autopsy

20:09.609 --> 20:10.877
in my place of business

20:10.977 --> 20:12.412
and you thought
I <i>might</i> have a problem?

20:12.512 --> 20:14.113
Dee, it is just
a quick look.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.214
For a friend?

20:15.315 --> 20:16.516
I blame you.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.950
Hey, I just made the
introduction, all right?

20:18.050 --> 20:19.619
You two decided to be
tennis buddies.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.120
Pickleball.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.991
What do you expect to find
that the local coroners didn't?

20:25.091 --> 20:26.593
Doctor?

20:26.693 --> 20:29.762
I'll know when I see it?
Well, start seeing

20:29.862 --> 20:31.030
because the viewing
starts in five minutes

20:31.130 --> 20:32.299
and the family
is about to arrive.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.133
Mm-hmm,
the crime family.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.271
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.706
Uh, we're just...
Oh, yeah, so we're

20:39.806 --> 20:41.040
just making some
final arrangements.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.609
Five minutes in the lobby.
Thank you.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.076
There's sugar cookies
over there, yeah.

20:46.346 --> 20:47.580
There goes my Yelp rating.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.015
Okay,
if I wanted to kill you

20:49.115 --> 20:50.517
and make it look
like a heart attack,

20:50.617 --> 20:51.951
how would I do it?
Based on your BMI,

20:52.051 --> 20:53.620
I'm guessing you were on
some sort of beta blockers,

20:53.720 --> 20:56.756
which interact with
a whole host of drugs.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.426
Most of which cannot be detected

20:59.526 --> 21:02.529
and some of which would cause
a myocardial infarction.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.664
Especially if injected.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.699
Jimmy, I've seen
every inch of this body.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.167
There were no needle marks.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.902
Did you check under
all of the fingernails?

21:10.002 --> 21:12.171
Or how about between the toes?

21:13.740 --> 21:16.108
Don't you dare.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.646
Do you know how hard
it is to get those on?

21:19.746 --> 21:21.080
Oh, come on.
No.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.783
No, no, no.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.786
Um... does he have any tattoos?

21:26.886 --> 21:28.621
On his chest. Why?

21:29.989 --> 21:32.091
The coroner would've noticed
a chest puncture.

21:32.191 --> 21:34.894
No, not if it's hidden
in the ink.

21:36.329 --> 21:40.132
It could be
the tiniest pinprick.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.302
Almost invisible.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.038
There it is.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.173
Here.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.642
This was murder.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.144
So what does that mean?

21:52.244 --> 21:53.846
It means this body
is ours now.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.081
What the hell is

21:55.181 --> 21:56.516
going on in here?
Oh.

21:56.616 --> 21:57.617
Apologize, sir.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.752
It's gonna take another minute.

22:01.253 --> 22:03.089
This is might sound
kind of weird...

22:04.391 --> 22:05.892
Do you have a limp?

22:10.997 --> 22:13.199
I said I don't know
about any robbery.

22:13.299 --> 22:15.001
Well, I'm sure your DNA
will say otherwise.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.769
You know that's treatable?

22:18.070 --> 22:19.305
Julian Reinhardt.

22:19.406 --> 22:20.673
Related to the deceased?

22:20.773 --> 22:22.041
He's my uncle.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.314
Poor Uncle Rhino.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.383
Julian, are you crying?

22:30.483 --> 22:31.784
It's a funeral, okay?

22:31.884 --> 22:33.386
Yeah. Yours.

22:33.486 --> 22:37.156
So we know that you tried
to steal weapons.

22:37.256 --> 22:39.158
But then got stuck
in the wrong vault

22:39.258 --> 22:41.260
where you ended up watching
your partner in crime

22:41.360 --> 22:42.529
slowly die.

22:42.629 --> 22:43.796
What we don't know is

22:43.896 --> 22:45.998
who tried to blow up Carter.

22:46.098 --> 22:47.500
What?

22:47.600 --> 22:50.537
That school dad?
After the robbery went wrong,

22:50.637 --> 22:51.704
someone tried to take out

22:51.804 --> 22:53.005
everyone in connection
to the heist.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.841
We just gotta to find out
who did it.

22:54.941 --> 22:57.343
You or dear Uncle Rhino.

22:57.444 --> 22:59.378
You don't talk
about him that way.

22:59.479 --> 23:02.449
Not at his own funeral.
The man was like a father to me.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.083
Yeah, and you never got
to say goodbye.

23:04.183 --> 23:05.552
Because your dumb ass
got stuck in a vault.

23:05.652 --> 23:07.186
That was an accident!

23:07.854 --> 23:09.088
Shh.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.929
The vault may have been
an accident,

23:17.029 --> 23:18.330
but the car bomb was not.

23:18.431 --> 23:19.766
You got it all wrong.

23:19.866 --> 23:21.000
I would never hurt Carter.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.535
And neither would Rhino.

23:22.635 --> 23:23.903
And why not?

23:24.003 --> 23:25.905
Because Carter
and my uncle were friends.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.440
That's how this all started.

23:27.540 --> 23:30.710
Carter asked Rhino to find
some stolen money.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.078
He agreed to help.

23:32.178 --> 23:35.147
So Carter is
telling us the truth.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.284
All I know is that
Rhino was a good guy.

23:38.384 --> 23:40.653
You know, it's Carter
who's a little shady.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.288
And why would you say that?

23:42.388 --> 23:45.458
Because. You know that money
that Carter was looking for?

23:45.558 --> 23:47.727
That wasn't his
in the first place.

23:47.827 --> 23:50.763
He took the money
from his kid's school.

23:53.065 --> 23:55.201
Oh, McGee is gonna love this.

24:05.144 --> 24:08.781
You need a wingman
in there?
Nah. I got this one.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.922
Tim, why are we, uh...
why are we back in here?

24:16.022 --> 24:17.156
That.

24:17.256 --> 24:18.658
The school fundraiser?

24:18.758 --> 24:20.660
McGEE:
You were the chairperson
to a $500,000

24:20.760 --> 24:22.729
campaign to build
an innovation lab

24:22.829 --> 24:24.631
so the students
can learn how to code.

24:24.731 --> 24:27.399
A campaign
that I donated money to.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.701
Generously, I might add.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.070
So you can understand
why I'm upset.

24:31.170 --> 24:32.872
You stole the fundraising money.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.406
I-- Wait, what?

24:34.507 --> 24:35.942
That money that was stolen
out of your crypto account?

24:36.042 --> 24:38.244
It didn't belong to you.
It belonged to the school.

24:38.344 --> 24:39.411
Uh, no, I can explain--

24:39.512 --> 24:40.647
You stole the fundraising money.

24:40.747 --> 24:42.549
No, I didn't...
And you lied to me.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.517
No!
I thought "friends
don't do that," huh?

24:44.617 --> 24:46.619
We're not friends, okay?

24:48.054 --> 24:50.690
That's why I didn't tell you
about the fundraising money.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.093
You're the only school dad
that actually talks to me

24:54.193 --> 24:55.995
and I was afraid that
if I told you the truth,

24:56.095 --> 24:57.329
you'd jump to conclusions.

24:57.429 --> 25:00.099
Like-like you're doing.
You lied.

25:00.199 --> 25:03.102
I withheld a minor detail
that didn't seem relevant.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.671
Well, it is.

25:04.771 --> 25:07.273
Carter, did you take
the fundraising money or not?

25:07.373 --> 25:08.808
No.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.476
But...

25:10.577 --> 25:12.178
it's my fault that it's gone.

25:12.278 --> 25:15.181
When I volunteered to chair
the fundraising committee,

25:15.281 --> 25:17.550
I didn't realize that I'd be
the only volunteer.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.485
I was all alone.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.520
And after two years,
despite all the bake sales

25:21.621 --> 25:23.556
and the car washes
and the silent auctions,

25:23.656 --> 25:26.158
we were only halfway
to the 500K.

25:26.258 --> 25:30.029
I needed to come up with
a creative way to raise money.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.064
So instead of using
a low-yield savings account,

25:32.164 --> 25:34.967
I moved the funds
into a crypto account.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.669
$250,000?

25:36.769 --> 25:38.004
It's supposed to be
like a bank.

25:38.104 --> 25:39.271
Like all the ads say.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.807
I thought I was doing
something good.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.409
Yeah.

25:43.509 --> 25:46.646
And then a lot of,
a lot of bad happened.

25:46.746 --> 25:48.915
The robbery, the...
the car bomb.

25:49.015 --> 25:51.718
And, I mean, and now
Rhino's dead?
Yes.

25:51.818 --> 25:53.219
And according to his nephew,

25:53.319 --> 25:56.088
he was killed trying to find
the stolen school money.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.458
Well, don't get
too teary.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.093
He was a bad guy.

26:01.193 --> 26:03.495
Even if he wasn't the one
trying to kill you.

26:03.596 --> 26:04.764
So who was?

26:04.864 --> 26:06.532
Well, that's what we need
to find out.

26:06.633 --> 26:09.636
Well, i-if Rhino started
tracking down the money,

26:09.736 --> 26:11.370
maybe he found a lead.

26:11.470 --> 26:15.407
And maybe NCIS could follow
that lead using my laptop.

26:15.507 --> 26:16.843
Except we can't find
your laptop.

26:16.943 --> 26:19.178
Carter, you didn't tell
any other "friends"

26:19.278 --> 26:21.347
about this
crypto account, right?
No.

26:21.447 --> 26:23.049
No, of course not. No.

26:23.149 --> 26:24.216
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

26:24.316 --> 26:26.185
Okay.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.587
Unless you count Owen.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.228
McGEE:
Owen Belfort.

26:36.328 --> 26:37.897
Wait, the preppy dad
from the juice bar?

26:37.997 --> 26:40.199
Apparently, he was bragging
about cryptocurrency

26:40.299 --> 26:41.400
in the school parking lot

26:41.500 --> 26:42.969
and Carter asked
for investment advice.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.236
So Preppy knew about the money.

26:44.336 --> 26:45.738
And he was at the juice bar

26:45.838 --> 26:46.939
right before the bomb went off.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.474
This guy is full of surprises.

26:48.574 --> 26:49.709
Looks like preppy dad Owen

26:49.809 --> 26:51.410
is a real estate investor

26:51.510 --> 26:52.979
and his last project went bust.

26:53.079 --> 26:54.480
How much did he lose?
Personally?

26:54.580 --> 26:56.448
Almost 300K.
With interest.

26:56.548 --> 26:58.685
Well, that sounds like motive
to me. We should bring him in.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.152
Really?
The guy ties

27:00.252 --> 27:02.621
a sweater around his
neck for a DMV photo.

27:02.722 --> 27:03.923
If we're gonna
get him to talk,

27:04.023 --> 27:05.491
we'll need concrete
evidence first.

27:05.591 --> 27:06.959
What does a sweater
have to do with it?

27:07.059 --> 27:08.661
Anybody who dresses like that's
got a good lawyer

27:08.761 --> 27:10.229
on speed dial.
So we need to find

27:10.329 --> 27:12.564
a way to tie Preppy
directly to Reinhardt's murder.

27:12.665 --> 27:14.100
Or the stolen money.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.968
I will start working
on a warrant for bank records,

27:16.068 --> 27:17.870
but I'm guessing he's got
a good accountant, too.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.940
Cashmere and perfect posture
do not pay for themselves.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.675
Wait a second.

27:22.775 --> 27:24.576
I might have a better idea.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.147
Kase.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.481
Do you still have that

27:29.581 --> 27:31.017
posture-correcting device
that I gave you?

27:31.117 --> 27:32.985
The one that vibrates
when you slouch.
Oh, my gosh.

27:33.085 --> 27:35.354
Have it? I am
wearing it right now.

27:35.454 --> 27:36.588
I love this little thing.

27:36.689 --> 27:38.290
Oh, you don't
want it back, do you?

27:38.390 --> 27:40.259
I just need
to check something. Okay.

27:40.359 --> 27:41.794
Thank you.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.532
Ugh, what a mess.

27:46.632 --> 27:48.500
Whoever wrote this code
was no da Vinci.

27:48.600 --> 27:49.969
Just what I thought.

27:50.069 --> 27:51.771
Company still hasn't
corrected that security flaw.

27:51.871 --> 27:53.773
What security flaw?

27:53.873 --> 27:55.574
Every time
the device vibrates,

27:55.674 --> 27:58.544
it sends data to the
user's cell phone, right?

27:58.644 --> 28:00.012
Mm-hmm.
Including GPS.

28:00.112 --> 28:01.447
Oh, yeah.
It's how I know

28:01.547 --> 28:02.882
when and where
I slouch the most.

28:02.982 --> 28:05.117
Hint-- It's while
I'm working.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.518
Oh.

28:06.618 --> 28:08.554
Point is, that info
is supposed to be private,

28:08.654 --> 28:10.122
but because of
the security flaw,

28:10.222 --> 28:12.124
anyone nearby
can intercept the data.

28:12.224 --> 28:15.261
And why are you just now
telling me about this?

28:15.361 --> 28:17.196
Because we are going
to use it to find out

28:17.296 --> 28:18.831
where our suspect was
during the murder.

28:18.931 --> 28:21.200
Owen wears
the exact same device.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.069
And you know this because...

28:23.169 --> 28:25.104
We got it from
the exact same place.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.939
A chiropractor dad
gave them away

28:27.039 --> 28:28.908
in goodie bags
at a school event--

28:29.008 --> 28:30.509
"Doughnuts with the Doc."

28:30.609 --> 28:32.611
Parents really like alliteration.

28:32.711 --> 28:33.980
If we can get

28:34.080 --> 28:35.748
within two feet of Owen,
when he slouches...

28:35.848 --> 28:37.483
Then we can get his GPS data.

28:37.583 --> 28:41.353
We just have to find an excuse
to invade his personal space.

28:41.453 --> 28:42.654
Yeah, without drawing attention.

28:42.755 --> 28:45.024
Oh. Wait.
I might know a way.

28:45.124 --> 28:48.360
I have been combing
through Owen's social media.

28:48.460 --> 28:49.829
He is hosting an event

28:49.929 --> 28:53.866
at his house tonight and
all school dads are invited.

28:53.966 --> 28:56.702
Oof. Another dad event.
Oh, come on.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.070
You're the one
who was complaining

28:58.170 --> 29:00.106
that all they ask you
about is your job.

29:00.206 --> 29:01.874
Look at this as
an opportunity for them

29:01.974 --> 29:03.342
to get to know you better.

29:03.442 --> 29:06.145
This could be a whole
new bonding experience.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.283
Whoa.

29:14.921 --> 29:18.690
Fantasy Football
& Father's Night.

29:19.691 --> 29:21.227
How am I supposed
to bond with these guys?

29:21.327 --> 29:23.930
I don't know the first thing
about fantasy football.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.731
:
Or reality football.

29:25.832 --> 29:27.133
Leave that to us, McGee.

29:27.233 --> 29:28.567
We are right here with you.

29:28.667 --> 29:30.069
Well, there's our target.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.938
Looks like it would be
easy enough to get close.

29:32.038 --> 29:33.840
Except he looks like
the life of the party.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.774
Just, uh, just ease your way

29:35.875 --> 29:37.443
into their conversation.

29:37.543 --> 29:40.779
What am I supposed to say to
a bunch of overaged frat boys?

29:40.880 --> 29:42.148
Just tell them the truth.

29:42.248 --> 29:43.916
Your jersey is from
the evidence garage

29:44.016 --> 29:46.152
and the barbecue stain on
your sleeve is actually blood.

29:46.252 --> 29:47.486
Dudes love that.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.188
Hey, hey, O.J.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.556
Didn't expect
to see you here.

29:50.656 --> 29:52.358
First time?
Yeah, yeah.

29:52.458 --> 29:53.425
Hey.
Good to see ya.

29:53.525 --> 29:54.493
Good to see you.

29:54.593 --> 29:55.794
Uh, name is Tim,
actually. Hey.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.964
He's talking about
your jersey.

29:58.064 --> 29:59.866
O.J. Simpson
wore number 32.

29:59.966 --> 30:01.901
Yeah, though I'd like to think
Jim Brown wore it better.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.535
Franco Harris?

30:03.635 --> 30:04.937
Not helping.

30:05.037 --> 30:06.672
You know, speaking of O.J.,

30:06.772 --> 30:08.540
I've always had this theory--

30:08.640 --> 30:11.177
Hear me out. MKUltra

30:11.277 --> 30:13.913
and the Illuminati...

30:15.314 --> 30:17.716
If the glove fits... uh?

30:17.816 --> 30:18.918
All right, everybody, listen up.

30:19.018 --> 30:21.153
Listen up. Settle down.

30:21.253 --> 30:22.855
We've come to my favorite part

30:22.955 --> 30:25.691
of Fantasy Football
& Fathers Night.

30:25.791 --> 30:28.194
The part where we
turn off the football

30:28.294 --> 30:32.064
and talk about
being fantasy fathers.

30:38.404 --> 30:39.972
Now, society loves

30:40.072 --> 30:42.241
to shove us
into these boxes, right?

30:42.341 --> 30:44.376
Well, this is our chance
to break out of those boxes

30:44.476 --> 30:47.079
and talk about the people
that we really want to be.

30:47.179 --> 30:50.049
So join me in the share circle,
get yourself comfortable,

30:50.149 --> 30:52.151
and, uh, remember,
this is a safe space.

30:53.319 --> 30:54.753
Tim, as our first-timer,

30:54.853 --> 30:56.488
why don't you come sit
next to me? Sorry, buddy. Okay.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.024
Sure.

30:58.124 --> 31:00.292
: Don't know
what is happening here.

31:00.392 --> 31:04.931
Looks like our frat dads are
actually enlightened modern men.

31:05.031 --> 31:06.365
Unexpected, but refreshing.

31:06.465 --> 31:09.035
This is your chance, McGee.
He's slouching.

31:09.135 --> 31:11.203
Start downloading the GPS data.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.872
Larry, why don't you
kick us off?
Oh, all right, here we go.

31:13.973 --> 31:17.043
Hot seat. Yes, thanks, O-dawg.

31:17.143 --> 31:18.911
Ah... Let's see, this week

31:19.011 --> 31:22.114
I was not exactly
a fantasy father.

31:22.214 --> 31:25.851
I snapped at my son during
his math homework again...

31:25.952 --> 31:30.822
You know, "a quick temper makes
a fool of you soon enough."

31:30.923 --> 31:34.760
Wise words
from Master Bruce Lee.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.439
Think fast, Timbo!
Ooh.

31:48.874 --> 31:50.776
Thanks. Um...

31:53.012 --> 31:55.181
I'm, I'm gonna pass.

31:55.281 --> 31:58.284
Oh...
House rules.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.919
You can't pass
the feelings football

32:01.020 --> 32:02.788
until you've shared
your feelings.

32:02.888 --> 32:04.456
You got this.

32:04.556 --> 32:07.326
I... think you're
on your own, McGee.

32:07.426 --> 32:10.462
All right.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.331
Okay.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.638
Yeah.

32:19.738 --> 32:22.508
Yeah, actually, I have been
wanting to talk about

32:22.608 --> 32:24.076
something other than the job.

32:26.012 --> 32:28.180
Wh...

32:29.815 --> 32:31.317
Uh, you know what?

32:31.417 --> 32:32.951
Actually, I have
to take this.

32:33.052 --> 32:35.121
Um, would you mind
holding this for a second?

32:35.221 --> 32:36.488
I'll, uh,
I'll be right back.

32:36.588 --> 32:37.823
Thanks, guys.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.630
What happened?
Did McGee get the info?

32:44.730 --> 32:45.998
Not sure.

32:46.098 --> 32:48.067
There was a problem with
"the feelings football."

32:48.167 --> 32:49.735
Huh? The what?

32:49.835 --> 32:51.837
McGee, you okay?

32:51.937 --> 32:54.840
Yeah, I'm good.
I just sent you the data.
Got it.

32:54.940 --> 32:56.575
Putting up GPS tags now.

32:56.675 --> 33:00.146
Okay, we've got preppy dad Owen
at the juice bar.

33:00.246 --> 33:02.248
All right. Well, that's
opportunity for the car bomb.

33:02.348 --> 33:04.150
Now all we need is
Preppy Dad next to Reinhardt

33:04.250 --> 33:05.484
and we got opportunity
for the murder.

33:05.584 --> 33:06.952
Well, that might be a problem.

33:07.053 --> 33:08.654
GPS puts Preppy
in a remote corner

33:08.754 --> 33:11.090
of the Blue Ridge Mountains
for the past six days.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.125
Well, what's in
the Blue Ridge Mountains?

33:13.225 --> 33:15.594
Uh, it's a spiritual retreat
that specializes

33:15.694 --> 33:17.396
in mind-altering experiences.

33:18.864 --> 33:21.700
Aka a sweat lodge for
rich people to drop acid.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.835
Not only was Preppy Dad
not in the same city,

33:23.935 --> 33:25.804
he wasn't even
in the same dimension.

33:25.904 --> 33:27.406
He's not our killer.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.578
You know, he always was
kind of standoffish.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.280
Do you think that
was a real phone call?

33:34.380 --> 33:37.049
I think he just needs a second.

33:37.149 --> 33:40.752
Or maybe Cop Dad thinks
he's too good for us.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.688
What a poser.

33:54.633 --> 33:57.069
Yeah. All right, thanks.

33:57.169 --> 33:59.271
That was the manager
to the spiritual retreat.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.208
He confirmed that the suspect
was there last week.

34:02.308 --> 34:03.775
So, not our killer. No.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.477
And according to
his financial records,

34:05.577 --> 34:07.846
there's no sign
of stolen school money.

34:07.946 --> 34:10.116
Money doesn't just disappear.

34:10.216 --> 34:11.717
I'm not so sure.

34:11.817 --> 34:14.753
I've been trying to track
Carter's cryptocurrency account.

34:14.853 --> 34:17.055
Now, crypto transaction
data is public,

34:17.156 --> 34:18.357
accessible
to everyone.

34:18.457 --> 34:20.025
That's what makes
the blockchain secure.

34:20.126 --> 34:21.260
Well, yeah, usually.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.494
But whoever stole the coin

34:22.594 --> 34:24.096
modified
the verification conditions

34:24.196 --> 34:25.431
to hide their identity.

34:25.531 --> 34:26.698
You know, I've got
Mempool data

34:26.798 --> 34:28.100
given to me
by Kasie here,

34:28.200 --> 34:29.801
but it's going to take me
forever to sort through.

34:29.901 --> 34:30.936
Damn.

34:31.937 --> 34:33.405
I don't know
what that means.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.441
It means I'm not gonna be able
to find the missing money

34:35.541 --> 34:37.008
without Carter's laptop.

34:37.109 --> 34:38.844
I guess the school will have to
update their goal chart.

34:38.944 --> 34:42.047
$250,000 all the way down
to zero.

34:42.148 --> 34:44.082
Yeah, when school parents
find out about this,

34:44.183 --> 34:46.118
they're gonna be
looking for blood.
Yeah.

34:46.218 --> 34:48.053
Carter's.
Poor guy.

34:48.154 --> 34:49.455
Poor guy?

34:49.555 --> 34:51.157
I thought you were one
of those angry parents.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.691
Yeah, I was, but...

34:52.791 --> 34:54.960
I don't know, maybe
I jumped to conclusions.

34:59.231 --> 35:02.934
Did something happen last night
at that, uh, share circle?

35:04.536 --> 35:07.906
Well, let's just say I know what
it feels like to be misjudged.

35:08.006 --> 35:11.377
Right? Carter is very Carter.
But, you know, he means well.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.679
You should tell him that.
What? Now?

35:13.779 --> 35:15.214
I mean, the man's still
our best lead.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.415
Our only lead.

35:16.515 --> 35:17.616
You think he still
knows something?

35:17.716 --> 35:19.618
Or he doesn't know
what he knows.

35:19.718 --> 35:23.589
Maybe a friendly chat
would knock something loose.

35:23.689 --> 35:26.725
You mean small talk?

35:27.626 --> 35:29.228
It's a risk of the job.

35:32.130 --> 35:35.267
Hmm. Sweet or savory...?

35:35.367 --> 35:37.903
Whatever you choose, I'm buying.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.974
:
I got him.

35:45.211 --> 35:46.945
So, uh...

35:47.045 --> 35:49.181
it's nice weather
we've been having lately, huh?

35:52.184 --> 35:54.520
Why are you being social?

35:54.620 --> 35:55.987
Friends do that.

35:56.087 --> 35:57.656
Do they?

35:57.756 --> 35:59.691
So I've heard.

36:01.227 --> 36:03.462
Hey, let me ask you something. Okay.

36:03.562 --> 36:05.264
What is up
with Mrs. Cringler?

36:05.364 --> 36:08.367
I mean, she's giving homework?
In kindergarten?

36:08.467 --> 36:10.035
Thank you.
Let them be kids, right?

36:10.135 --> 36:12.238
Yeah, really.
That's what I say.

36:12.338 --> 36:14.440
But, you know, Johnny and
Morgan seem to love her.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.408
And Maddie, too.
She even insisted on

36:16.508 --> 36:17.843
dressing as Miss
Cringler last week.

36:17.943 --> 36:18.944
Yeah? You got pictures?

36:19.044 --> 36:20.612
Yeah, she got
the glasses right

36:20.712 --> 36:21.747
And the wig.

36:21.847 --> 36:22.881
There you go.

36:22.981 --> 36:24.350
McGEE:
Beautiful daughter.

36:24.450 --> 36:26.117
Yeah, thank you.

36:26.218 --> 36:27.686
I'm very fortunate.

36:27.786 --> 36:30.055
As an independent contractor,
I get to make my own hours

36:30.155 --> 36:32.258
and basically be
a stay-at-home parent, so...

36:32.358 --> 36:33.792
Huh.

36:33.892 --> 36:35.160
That's why I volunteer to do
so many things at school.

36:35.261 --> 36:37.263
Like, uh, Man-Time Mondays?

36:37.363 --> 36:39.097
Yeah, sometimes I just
got to talk to somebody

36:39.197 --> 36:41.767
outside of the house
who isn't five years old. Yeah.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.303
And seeing as how Fantasy
Football Night isn't my thing,

36:44.403 --> 36:45.704
I do the juice bar.

36:45.804 --> 36:48.039
It's just a shame
that no one ever comes.

36:48.139 --> 36:50.876
Never?
Well, Larry came
a few times.

36:50.976 --> 36:53.379
You know, that Dad Bro
who drives the convertible?

36:53.479 --> 36:56.682
Yeah, the one with all
conspiracy theories?

36:56.782 --> 36:58.917
Yeah.
He's actually
nice to me.

36:59.017 --> 37:01.186
He even considered cochairing
the fundraising committee.

37:01.287 --> 37:04.890
Did you ever tell Larry
about the crypto investment?

37:04.990 --> 37:06.692
You're still looking for
a break in the case?

37:06.792 --> 37:08.894
Well, I hate
to disappoint you,

37:08.994 --> 37:10.896
but I didn't tell anybody
else about the account.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.298
Sorry.

37:12.398 --> 37:13.665
In fact, I never even used

37:13.765 --> 37:15.000
my laptop in public
unless I was alone.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.468
Didn't want anybody
looking over my shoulder.

37:16.568 --> 37:19.070
And when I did sign on,
I made sure I used a VPN.

37:19.170 --> 37:20.639
Wait.

37:20.739 --> 37:24.142
You used the Internet
in the juice bar?

37:24.242 --> 37:25.411
Yes.

37:25.511 --> 37:26.712
Uh...

37:26.812 --> 37:28.480
Since nobody ever comes
to Man-Time Monday,

37:28.580 --> 37:29.648
I would usually
get some work done.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.082
But like I said,

37:31.182 --> 37:32.584
I made sure there were
no customers in there.

37:32.684 --> 37:35.020
I'm not worried
about the customers.

37:40.659 --> 37:41.927
Hey, Sam.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.397
Carter. Hey.
Where you been, man?

37:45.497 --> 37:48.467
I haven't seen you since that
explosion out on the street.

37:48.567 --> 37:49.468
What happened?

37:49.568 --> 37:50.869
It's a long story.

37:50.969 --> 37:52.304
But I've been working with NCIS

37:52.404 --> 37:53.772
and they said it was
some kind of bomb.

37:53.872 --> 37:55.874
Crazy, right?

37:57.042 --> 37:58.043
Yeah.

37:58.143 --> 37:59.778
The usual?
Oh, yeah, you know it.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.413
You got it.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.315
Just have to grab some more
whipped cream from the back.

38:03.415 --> 38:04.316
Okay.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.385
So, a bomb, huh?

38:06.485 --> 38:09.187
NCIS know who did it?

38:09.287 --> 38:10.689
At first they thought
it was this gangster type,

38:10.789 --> 38:12.090
but not anymore.

38:13.725 --> 38:14.960
Yeah.

38:17.162 --> 38:18.830
They said they have
another suspect,

38:18.930 --> 38:20.566
but wouldn't tell me
anything else.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.167
Uh-huh.

38:22.267 --> 38:23.902
I'm sure they'll catch
the guy, though.

38:24.903 --> 38:27.172
Everything okay back there?

38:27.272 --> 38:28.840
Yeah.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.977
I think we're all out
of whipped cream.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.614
On second thought...

38:35.714 --> 38:37.148
hold the whipped cream.

38:38.384 --> 38:40.386
Uh-uh. It's over, Sam.

38:40.486 --> 38:43.154
Or should we
call you Hans?

38:45.156 --> 38:48.293
Bet you haven't heard
that name in a while.

38:49.561 --> 38:52.831
Turns out, Sam the manager
is actually Hans Bjurstrom.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.165
A former mercenary

38:54.265 --> 38:55.734
wanted for killing
two police officers

38:55.834 --> 38:57.603
in Stockholm in 2007.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.037
He's been hiding in
the U.S. ever since.

38:59.137 --> 39:00.906
Working various jobs,
keeping a low profile.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.641
Then things got a little
too boring,

39:02.741 --> 39:05.110
so Hans decided to use
the juice bar Wi-Fi

39:05.210 --> 39:06.545
to spy on people's computers.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.880
He saw Carter's crypto
account and password.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.982
Let me guess.
He figured that 250K was

39:11.082 --> 39:13.118
his ticket out of
the service industry?

39:13.218 --> 39:14.720
And into early retirement.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.855
That is, until Carter went to

39:16.955 --> 39:18.223
a dangerous gangster for help.

39:18.323 --> 39:20.125
But then, Hans got nervous
and took him out.

39:20.225 --> 39:21.627
And then tried to
blow up Carter.

39:21.727 --> 39:25.096
He counted on police blaming
Reinhardt, which we did.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.999
Until we found out
the gangster wasn't all bad.

39:28.099 --> 39:30.936
And the juice bar manager
wasn't all good.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.471
Well, time reveals all.

39:32.571 --> 39:34.072
Almost, Director.

39:34.172 --> 39:35.607
The school money's
still missing.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.776
We recovered Carter's laptop
from Hans's apartment.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.846
But McGee and Kasie have not
been able to trace the account.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.614
That's McGee.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.015
Did they find the money?

39:45.617 --> 39:47.419
Not exactly.

39:55.594 --> 39:56.495
Hey.

39:56.595 --> 39:57.863
Sorry I'm late.

39:57.963 --> 40:00.031
Oh. I was afraid you weren't
gonna come at all.

40:00.131 --> 40:02.534
You haven't been
answering my texts, so...

40:02.634 --> 40:03.969
Well, I've been a little busy.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.871
Right. Trying to find
the money. Um... Yeah.

40:05.971 --> 40:07.372
How's that going?

40:07.473 --> 40:09.074
Well, we were, uh...

40:09.174 --> 40:11.543
we were able to find the account
that the money was moved to.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.745
Well, hey, that's good.
Yeah, but then it got

40:13.845 --> 40:14.780
a little complicated.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.414
Okay, that's bad.

40:16.515 --> 40:17.949
Yeah.

40:18.049 --> 40:21.587
By the, by the time
we were able to find the money

40:21.687 --> 40:23.254
and seize the account,

40:23.354 --> 40:27.493
there really wasn't
$250,000 left in it.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.230
Tell me there was at least
some money left?

40:33.398 --> 40:34.800
There was.

40:35.801 --> 40:39.838
$527,000.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.409
Did you say $500...?

40:44.510 --> 40:46.344
And $27,000.

40:46.444 --> 40:49.447
Turns out that Hans,
your juice bar buddy,

40:49.548 --> 40:52.083
moved the stolen money
into his own crypto account.

40:52.183 --> 40:54.953
Well, what can I say?
It's a volatile market.

40:55.053 --> 40:57.422
Wh-- And the school gets
to keep it all?

40:57.523 --> 40:59.925
We had to pull
some strings, but, uh...

41:00.025 --> 41:01.459
Yeah, I think you met
your fundraiser goal.

41:03.562 --> 41:05.396
Thank you, Tim. I--

41:05.497 --> 41:06.765
I-I swear, next time,

41:06.865 --> 41:08.233
I'm gonna stick to
bake sales and car washes.

41:08.333 --> 41:10.468
Yeah, I know you are,
because next time

41:10.569 --> 41:12.170
I'm gonna be your cochair.

41:16.007 --> 41:18.043
In that case, I'm buying.
Come on.

41:18.143 --> 41:19.911
Deal.
All right.

41:20.011 --> 41:21.880
Hey, you know what?
Let's go get some coffee.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.181
Come on.
Really?

41:23.281 --> 41:25.551
Give the juice a rest.
Yeah, come on.

41:25.651 --> 41:26.918
What's wrong with juice?

41:27.018 --> 41:28.119
Nothing wrong with juice,
but you know,

41:28.219 --> 41:29.921
coffee is kind of
a special thing.
