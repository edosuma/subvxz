00:00.055 --> 00:02.790
Go. Go. You gotta go faster
than that. Come on, man.

00:02.815 --> 00:05.015
Keep it going. Oh!

00:05.053 --> 00:06.295
That's illegal.

00:06.320 --> 00:08.121
You're faster than Jim at school.

00:08.154 --> 00:09.722
Of course I'm faster than Jim at school.

00:09.757 --> 00:11.658
Jim at school is rubbish.

00:11.692 --> 00:13.126
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:13.160 --> 00:16.229
No cheating here.

00:16.263 --> 00:17.564
I gotta go.

00:17.598 --> 00:20.667
Mom, Uncle Adam's gotta go to work.

00:20.701 --> 00:22.068
Don't say it like that.

00:22.102 --> 00:23.469
What, are you trying to break my heart?

00:23.504 --> 00:24.904
Huh? It's working!

00:24.939 --> 00:26.573
I'm gonna see you on Tuesday, okay?

00:26.607 --> 00:27.740
- Okay.
- Yeah?

00:27.775 --> 00:29.008
All right, I love you, pal.

00:29.043 --> 00:30.577
Want me to pack up some breakfast?

00:30.611 --> 00:32.244
No, I'm okay. Thanks.

00:32.279 --> 00:34.080
Is everything all right?

00:34.114 --> 00:36.216
Yeah. Yeah, it will be.

01:29.503 --> 01:30.470
Jay.

01:32.539 --> 01:34.374
Jay. Hey, man. Wake up.

01:34.408 --> 01:35.708
Hey, it's all right. Whoa.

01:35.743 --> 01:38.311
Ho ho ho! Whoa.

01:38.345 --> 01:40.455
You okay?

01:40.502 --> 01:43.304
You all right?

01:43.339 --> 01:45.808
Yeah, man. I just came in to take a nap.

01:45.842 --> 01:50.312
A nap? It's 7:30 in the a.m., man.

01:50.346 --> 01:52.281
What are you doing here so early?

01:52.315 --> 01:56.885
I had to do some paperwork.

01:56.920 --> 01:59.221
Are you sure you're all right?

01:59.255 --> 02:01.456
Yeah, man. It was just...

02:01.491 --> 02:03.725
a bad dream.

02:09.933 --> 02:12.968
<i>Need a car at 5490 South Ellis.</i>

02:13.002 --> 02:16.905
<i>Drunk and disorderly. 2221, you close?</i>

02:16.940 --> 02:20.142
<i>2221. 10-4, We're riding on it.</i>

02:21.845 --> 02:24.112
<i>1831, just threw one in your queue.</i>

02:24.147 --> 02:26.415

02:26.449 --> 02:28.917
<i>One of the drivers is being

02:28.952 --> 02:30.786
<i>I'll send another car for traffic...</i>

02:30.820 --> 02:35.090
<i>Disregard. Incorrect

02:45.001 --> 02:47.035
5021 George, hold me down on that.

02:47.070 --> 02:49.104
Advise responding; plainclothes
officer will be on the scene.

02:49.138 --> 02:50.138
<i>Copy that.</i>

02:58.047 --> 03:00.115
- Hey! You got shots fired?
- No shots fired.

03:00.149 --> 03:01.884
- No eyes on him yet.
- Get a perimeter set up.

03:01.918 --> 03:03.452
Tell him to keep the cars coming.

03:03.486 --> 03:04.887
- I got you.
- Move, move, move.

03:04.921 --> 03:06.288
5021 George. I've got people running

03:06.322 --> 03:07.789
out of 1014 Randolph Park Ave.

03:07.824 --> 03:09.358
- Send me some help now!
<i>- Copy that.</i>

03:22.338 --> 03:23.972
Where is he? Where is he?

03:24.007 --> 03:27.009
- Up there, up there!
- All right, go. Get outside!

03:35.018 --> 03:36.985
5021 George, shooter's on the
second floor of 1014 Randolph...

04:08.985 --> 04:11.119
- Chicago PD!
- Police! Police!

04:11.154 --> 04:12.754
Take the exit!

04:16.726 --> 04:18.860
5021 George. Emergency. We got one down.

04:18.894 --> 04:20.295
- Roll an ambulance.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

04:20.329 --> 04:22.064
<i>Ambo on the way.</i>

04:25.668 --> 04:26.868
- How you doing?
- Hey.

04:26.903 --> 04:28.603
- You okay?
- Yeah.

04:28.638 --> 04:30.539
Offenders are in the wind.
The way this went down,

04:30.573 --> 04:32.140
there's gotta be more than one of them,

04:32.175 --> 04:34.376
'cause he couldn't have
got behind me that fast.

04:34.410 --> 04:35.777
How many victims?

04:35.812 --> 04:37.612
One. Her name was Theresa Mattel,

04:37.647 --> 04:39.548
she was a student at
Central Chicago University.

04:39.582 --> 04:41.483
Sarge, the offender fired three rounds.

04:41.517 --> 04:43.885
Two center mass, one head tap.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.587
Doesn't sound like a mass shooting.

04:45.621 --> 04:47.255
Yeah. It did not feel like one.

04:47.290 --> 04:49.658
He used a military stun grenade. M84.

04:49.692 --> 04:54.162
Huh. You were the first
detective on scene?

04:54.197 --> 04:55.964
Yeah. I was right around the corner.

04:55.999 --> 04:59.067
Huh. All right. Start pulling
footage from the park,

04:59.102 --> 05:00.736
inside the building. Let's find out

05:00.770 --> 05:02.938
- where they were coming from.
- Sarge.

05:02.972 --> 05:05.240
We have a witness
who saw our female victim

05:05.274 --> 05:06.775
running inside with a kid.

05:06.809 --> 05:08.610
She hid, heard gunshots, looked up,

05:08.644 --> 05:10.479
and saw the offender running for an exit

05:10.513 --> 05:11.747
with a boy over his shoulder.

05:11.781 --> 05:14.683
Any sign of the boy?

05:17.553 --> 05:19.755
So this is a kidnapping?

05:23.380 --> 05:27.010
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

05:29.132 --> 05:31.199
Tell me we got an ID on this boy.

05:31.234 --> 05:34.036
Not yet, but we do know
more about the DOA.

05:34.070 --> 05:36.171
She is originally from Dayton, Ohio.

05:36.205 --> 05:38.206
Biology major, worked
part-time as a nanny.

05:38.241 --> 05:40.342
So I assume the boy was under her watch.

05:40.376 --> 05:41.877
We're dumping her phone.

05:41.911 --> 05:43.612
Got a car on the way to her dorm.

05:43.646 --> 05:45.614
Local police are on the way
to talk to her parents.

05:45.648 --> 05:46.982
Anything that might make us think

05:47.016 --> 05:48.884
our DOA was the intended target?

05:48.918 --> 05:51.787
No. Sarge, it looks like
these guys were there

05:51.821 --> 05:53.789
to kidnap the boy, and
Theresa just got in the way.

05:53.823 --> 05:56.058
- Huh.
- Look.

05:56.092 --> 05:58.493
There's Theresa and the boy.

05:58.528 --> 06:00.195
Right.

06:00.229 --> 06:02.831
There's our shooter.

06:04.333 --> 06:05.967
There's our shooter's ghost.

06:06.002 --> 06:08.670
When this guy comes in,
he scans all the exits

06:08.704 --> 06:10.472
like he's never been there before.

06:10.506 --> 06:11.807
Then he goes up as cover.

06:11.841 --> 06:13.241
I don't think they meant to go in.

06:13.276 --> 06:14.976
I think this went wrong.

06:15.011 --> 06:16.645
Theresa saw them in the park
and she ran to protect the boy,

06:16.679 --> 06:18.313
and it got her killed instead.

06:18.347 --> 06:20.148
It might be a long shot,
but Narcotics has had a bead

06:20.183 --> 06:22.317
on a kidnapping and ransom
crew they can't make.

06:22.351 --> 06:23.919
I heard about this.
They're going after kids

06:23.953 --> 06:25.320
connected to west-side dope gangs.

06:25.354 --> 06:27.155
Right. The crew, they nab a kid,

06:27.190 --> 06:29.324
set ransom, banger pays
them with drug money,

06:29.358 --> 06:30.525
never calls the cops.

06:30.560 --> 06:32.227
No victim, no crime.

06:32.261 --> 06:33.995
All they got is what they're
hearing on the streets.

06:34.030 --> 06:37.599
Crew's three males.
Black, Hispanic, white.

06:37.633 --> 06:39.601
20s, trained.

06:39.635 --> 06:41.169
I mean, if we're to assume

06:41.204 --> 06:42.671
our guys had a getaway driver,
it's a match.

06:42.705 --> 06:44.372
Dig into it.

06:44.407 --> 06:46.007
- Hey, boss.
- Yeah.

06:46.042 --> 06:47.409
We ID'd the boy. Theresa's calendar says

06:47.443 --> 06:49.244
she picked up a Cody Barton.

06:49.278 --> 06:51.513
He was at a music lesson two
blocks away from Randolph Park.

06:51.547 --> 06:53.548
Olinksy's on his way
with the mom right now.

06:53.583 --> 06:56.518
Hey, tell Lugo keep a lid on
this to the press.

06:56.552 --> 06:58.353
If there's a crew
out there working a ransom,

06:58.387 --> 07:00.355
we don't want word of it to hit.

07:00.389 --> 07:02.257
Copy that.

07:08.331 --> 07:10.232
Yes, that's Theresa.

07:10.266 --> 07:15.070
She helps my ex-husband
driving, babysitting, but I...

07:15.104 --> 07:18.140
Cody's dad hasn't called.
Cody was with him all weekend.

07:18.174 --> 07:22.210
Yeah, we're trying to track
down your ex-husband right now.

07:22.245 --> 07:24.946
Can you tell me what does
Ben do for a living?

07:24.981 --> 07:28.483
- He's an accountant.
- Okay.

07:28.518 --> 07:32.554
So... Theresa...

07:32.588 --> 07:35.557
she's dead?

07:35.591 --> 07:38.426
I'm afraid so.

07:38.461 --> 07:41.930
Sorry.

07:41.964 --> 07:46.568
Amy, can you think
of anyone who might do this?

07:46.602 --> 07:48.603
No. Of course not.

07:48.638 --> 07:51.673
Not someone who would want
to kill a young woman

07:51.707 --> 07:54.476
and take my son.

07:54.510 --> 07:56.578
Hey, Amy, please. Hey.

07:56.612 --> 07:58.580
I want you to try to stay with me.

07:58.614 --> 08:01.082
Just one more question, okay?

08:01.117 --> 08:02.851
When you and Ben were getting divorced,

08:02.885 --> 08:04.786
were there any custody issues?

08:04.820 --> 08:07.122
No.

08:07.156 --> 08:10.492
Ben was a terrible husband,
but he is a good father.

08:10.526 --> 08:14.429
Cody's the only thing we ever agreed on.

08:14.463 --> 08:17.199
This doesn't make sense.

08:17.233 --> 08:19.968
We're just a normal family.

08:20.002 --> 08:23.271
This can't be happening!

08:25.007 --> 08:27.008
I'm so sorry.

08:29.745 --> 08:33.315
Ben Barton! Chicago PD, open up!

08:59.842 --> 09:03.111
Keys and cell phone are on the table.

09:08.584 --> 09:10.352
Oh, God.

09:18.594 --> 09:20.228
Take a look.

09:20.263 --> 09:23.265
Get that away from me, man.

09:23.299 --> 09:27.369
Looks like this K&R crew
just snatched another kid.

09:27.403 --> 09:29.571
You said you needed to talk
to me about a stash house.

09:29.604 --> 09:33.073
I lied. Now, Rey...

09:33.109 --> 09:35.343
I know your nephew was
kidnapped six months ago.

09:35.378 --> 09:37.245
I am not talking to you about this, bro.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.080
They sliced his finger off

09:39.115 --> 09:40.515
and sent it to your
brother in a cardboard box.

09:40.549 --> 09:42.684
- Come on, man.
- I'm not talking to you

09:42.718 --> 09:44.719
about this!

09:44.754 --> 09:47.622
This crew just grabbed another kid.

09:47.657 --> 09:49.724
Tell me how they work!

09:49.759 --> 09:51.860
Okay. How about I file that case

09:51.894 --> 09:53.528
I got sitting in my drawer?

09:53.562 --> 09:57.265
Violate your parole? Huh?

10:01.671 --> 10:03.705
Relax, okay?

10:03.739 --> 10:06.207
My brother got a call.

10:06.242 --> 10:08.143
They said they had his kid.

10:08.177 --> 10:10.312
They told him look on the porch.

10:10.346 --> 10:12.314
It was Bruno's finger in a box.

10:12.348 --> 10:16.384
They gave him 48 hours to get 400K.

10:16.419 --> 10:20.555
They told him where to place
the cash, where to drop it.

10:20.589 --> 10:22.290
Pricks got the cash.

10:22.325 --> 10:24.426
And they dropped Bruno off
on the side of the highway.

10:24.460 --> 10:28.563
All he remembers is that one of
these guys had a messed up arm.

10:28.597 --> 10:30.665
He said it looked like
his whole right forearm

10:30.700 --> 10:33.735
had been burnt up.
Like it was melting away.

10:33.769 --> 10:35.937
And that's it, bro.

10:42.278 --> 10:44.145
So what do we got on the crew?

10:44.180 --> 10:45.580
Well, these guys are trained,

10:45.614 --> 10:47.115
- so ran a query through the VA.
- Uh-huh.

10:47.149 --> 10:49.117
There's 350 soldiers injured

10:49.151 --> 10:50.852
with similar age, weight, and burn.

10:50.886 --> 10:52.454
But only four of them live in Chicago.

10:52.488 --> 10:55.457
And only one matches this well.
That's Luis Vega, 28,

10:55.491 --> 10:58.259
- 1st Ranger Battalion.
- Luis got booted last year

10:58.294 --> 11:01.262
due to an IED injury.
Right forearm burned through.

11:01.297 --> 11:02.964
After he got out, he spent three months

11:02.998 --> 11:05.367
in South America
on contract as security.

11:05.401 --> 11:07.635
AKA, he did kidnapping and ransoms.

11:07.670 --> 11:10.338
Yep. Height and weight
match this guy to a T.

11:10.373 --> 11:12.774
- We got someone headed to him?
- Covert car en route.

11:12.808 --> 11:14.209
- We'll get eyes.
- Good.

11:14.243 --> 11:15.777
Okay, but what's the plan, though?

11:15.811 --> 11:17.445
'Cause we can't grab him up
on what we got,

11:17.480 --> 11:19.447
and odds of him talking are not good.

11:19.482 --> 11:21.149
Plus if we spook the crew,
we could get this kid killed.

11:21.183 --> 11:22.984
Well, that's why we get eyes
on Luis right away.

11:23.018 --> 11:26.221
Or you put me under.

11:26.255 --> 11:27.822
He was a Ranger.
We served at the same time.

11:27.857 --> 11:30.625
- I can connect with him.
- That's a bad idea. No.

11:30.659 --> 11:32.527
An undercover would only heat him up.

11:32.561 --> 11:34.462
- We don't have enough info.
- That would be the point.

11:34.497 --> 11:36.865
I'd get it.

11:36.899 --> 11:38.767
Al?

11:42.405 --> 11:45.974
What about you? You got a take, Hailey?

11:46.008 --> 11:48.710
No. I'm neutral.

11:52.381 --> 11:54.482
Okay. Let's give it a shot.

11:58.187 --> 12:00.255
Ruzek will log everything.

12:00.289 --> 12:01.723
I'll stick by you in the field,

12:01.757 --> 12:03.425
and Antonio will be there as a second.

12:03.459 --> 12:06.060
We'll have eyes on you even
if you can't see us.

12:06.095 --> 12:09.931
Why the neutral?

12:09.965 --> 12:13.001
Just been a little concerned lately.

12:13.035 --> 12:15.069
About what?

12:15.104 --> 12:16.604
About you.

12:16.639 --> 12:20.375
You cover well, but I got eyes, Jay.

12:20.409 --> 12:23.545
You sure you're solid?

12:23.579 --> 12:25.013
Yo. We just got

12:25.047 --> 12:26.681
the undercover narcotics up to speed.

12:26.715 --> 12:29.217
We got the coverts trailing
Luis to the Veil Club.

12:29.251 --> 12:32.687
Bartender there named Camila.
That's his sister.

12:32.721 --> 12:34.189
Let's roll.

12:44.099 --> 12:46.201
Can I get you a drink?

12:46.235 --> 12:49.671
Yeah. Just beer. You pick.

12:50.773 --> 12:53.741
Hey, you like that
scrawny dude over there?

12:53.776 --> 12:55.276
Well, that's my brother.

12:55.311 --> 12:56.644
I mean, he doesn't usually
swing that way,

12:56.679 --> 12:57.979
but I can make an intro.

12:58.013 --> 13:02.150
No, just the beer is fine. Thanks.

13:02.184 --> 13:03.952
Was your brother in the Army?

13:03.986 --> 13:06.254
Yeah, he was. Ranger.

13:06.288 --> 13:08.590
Me too. I must have seen him at Benning.

13:08.624 --> 13:09.891
Hoorah!

13:09.925 --> 13:11.593
That's the Marines.

13:11.627 --> 13:12.894
Ha.

13:12.928 --> 13:15.063
Hey, Luis.

13:15.097 --> 13:17.332
- Luis, this is, uh...
- Ryan.

13:17.366 --> 13:19.901
75th. 3rd Rangers out of Benning.

13:19.935 --> 13:21.569
I must've seen you there, man.

13:21.604 --> 13:23.972
I was there the tail end of '06, '07.

13:24.006 --> 13:26.241
- So where'd you serve?
- Hey, man. I just came here

13:26.275 --> 13:28.276
for the drink, not to swap stories.

13:30.112 --> 13:32.580
That was so nice.
Is he always like that?

13:32.615 --> 13:35.450
A dick? Yeah. A solid 98% of the time.

13:35.484 --> 13:36.918
I just thought it'd be fun.

13:36.952 --> 13:38.786
Thanks.

13:52.468 --> 13:54.469
Yo, man. Watch where you're going.

13:54.503 --> 13:56.004
What, you got a problem, tough guy?

13:56.038 --> 13:57.372
What you think?

13:57.406 --> 14:00.308
Hey, does your brother know those guys?

14:01.377 --> 14:02.810
- Oh, you a tough guy, huh?
- What's going on?

14:02.845 --> 14:04.379
Bitch, get your ass back to the bar.

14:04.413 --> 14:06.147
- What'd you say?
- Calm down.

14:06.181 --> 14:08.182
I said get back to the bar, bitch.

14:08.217 --> 14:09.717
Unless you want to come to my house...

14:09.752 --> 14:11.286
- You do whatever you want.
- Hey, watch your mouth.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.687
What are you gonna do about it?

14:12.721 --> 14:14.656
- You wanna go?
- Take it outside.

14:22.031 --> 14:23.331
Yo, man! Hey, hey!

14:23.364 --> 14:25.666
- Your six!
- Need some help?

14:29.838 --> 14:32.640
Get out of here before the cops come!

14:32.674 --> 14:35.842
You all right? Come on, I got ya.

14:39.125 --> 14:42.694
Four tours? Damn, man.

14:44.263 --> 14:47.196
That's a lot of time in country.

14:48.133 --> 14:49.467
So what's it like being back home?

14:49.501 --> 14:51.402
You working anywhere?

14:51.437 --> 14:53.243
I do private security.

14:53.306 --> 14:56.742
Me too, man. Where you at?

14:56.776 --> 14:57.910
Nothing formal.

14:57.944 --> 14:59.745
I just work for another vet.

14:59.779 --> 15:02.781
Where the hell is she?

15:02.815 --> 15:04.850
Hey, man. Who's this other vet?

15:04.884 --> 15:07.619
And is he hiring?

15:09.622 --> 15:12.491
Look, my current job,
I make 7.50 an hour.

15:12.525 --> 15:14.459
And I gotta wear a
frickin' nametag that says,

15:14.494 --> 15:17.563
"Hi, I'm security friendly."

15:23.069 --> 15:26.038
It's a small group. I'm sorry.

15:26.072 --> 15:28.540
Yeah. Right on.

15:28.575 --> 15:30.309
Hey!

15:31.811 --> 15:33.745
I lost my keys.

15:39.852 --> 15:43.322
Whoa! You all right?

15:49.395 --> 15:52.030
Thanks for having my back today, man.

15:52.065 --> 15:54.666
That's it? You going to bed?

16:06.879 --> 16:09.348
What are you doing?

16:09.382 --> 16:11.817
Snooping.

16:11.851 --> 16:14.653
- It's a bad habit.
- You going through my mail?

16:14.687 --> 16:18.323
Either you didn't tell me
your name or I forgot it, so...

16:18.358 --> 16:21.393
Yeah, I'm goin' through your mail.

16:21.427 --> 16:23.695
I was just trying to be smooth.

16:32.038 --> 16:34.406
Camila Marie Vega.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.575
I even get the middle name.

16:36.609 --> 16:38.176
I don't want you digging around

16:38.211 --> 16:40.312
for my birth certificate.

16:43.983 --> 16:45.684
Is, uh, your brother okay?

16:45.718 --> 16:48.487
- He seems a little...
- Wasted?

16:50.890 --> 16:53.692
Just alcohol?

16:53.726 --> 16:55.527
Excuse me?

16:55.561 --> 16:58.864
Well, usually it's alcohol
and opiates, you know?

16:58.898 --> 17:01.199
If you're stuck at orange all the time,

17:01.234 --> 17:03.468
Oxy's the only that
brings you back to white.

17:03.503 --> 17:05.203
- Evens you out.
- Numbs you out.

17:05.238 --> 17:07.071
But thanks for your input.

17:07.106 --> 17:08.540
Sorry, I'm not trying to...

17:08.574 --> 17:11.576
Pry? Give me advice? Yeah, you are.

17:11.611 --> 17:13.278
I've just been there. That's all.

17:13.313 --> 17:14.713
I spent about seven months

17:14.747 --> 17:17.782
doing nothing but drink,
smoke, screw, fight.

17:19.585 --> 17:23.954
So is this how you usually hit on women?

17:23.990 --> 17:26.692
What? It's not working?

17:28.294 --> 17:30.962
So how'd you get over it?

17:34.000 --> 17:36.401
I got no idea.

17:36.436 --> 17:39.004
Yeah, well my brother, he just...

17:39.037 --> 17:41.339
he hasn't come back all the way.

17:41.374 --> 17:43.175
I don't think anybody ever does.

17:43.209 --> 17:44.910
I think you just kind of...

17:44.944 --> 17:48.013
fill up whatever's missing
with something else.

17:54.187 --> 17:55.654
<i>You need some help?</i>

17:55.688 --> 17:56.688
<i>Ughhhhh!</i>

17:56.723 --> 17:58.857
Halsted caught that dude flush.

17:58.891 --> 18:00.459
Innocent bystander too.

18:00.493 --> 18:01.960
Wasn't he only supposed
to throw one punch?

18:01.994 --> 18:04.596
If that. Upton said it got
a little hairy in there.

18:04.630 --> 18:05.931
No wonder she was pissed.

18:05.965 --> 18:07.833
That undercover must be mad as hell.

18:07.867 --> 18:10.869
Mm-hmm. And that Good
Samaritan's probably gonna sue

18:10.903 --> 18:12.671
when he finds out
that Halsted was a cop.

18:12.705 --> 18:14.206
You're gonna delete that, right?

18:14.240 --> 18:16.775
Of course. I'm not logging that.

18:20.246 --> 18:22.114
All right, anything on Cody's dad?

18:22.148 --> 18:23.949
Not yet, but he likes to visit

18:23.983 --> 18:25.350
- the bank a lot.
- Okay.

18:25.385 --> 18:27.652
His finances show a hell of a lot

18:27.687 --> 18:29.788
of cash deposits. All 9 grand,

18:29.822 --> 18:31.857
so that's just under
the federal threshold.

18:31.891 --> 18:34.526
All right, have Antonio and
Burgess hit up their CIs.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.128
Someone in Players gotta know this guy.

18:36.162 --> 18:37.462
Copy that.

18:37.497 --> 18:38.463
And Halsted?

18:38.498 --> 18:40.132
Uh... he's all good.

18:40.166 --> 18:43.869
He actually just got in contact
with Luis a few hours ago.

18:45.004 --> 18:46.037
Good.

18:51.077 --> 18:54.379
I ain't never gonna
get rid of you, am I?

18:54.414 --> 18:55.814
Do what I ask?

18:55.848 --> 18:58.083
Yeah, I asked my cousin
about Ben Barton.

18:58.117 --> 19:01.853
He washes money for us.
He ain't smart at it.

19:01.888 --> 19:03.355
How's that?

19:03.389 --> 19:05.223
He lost a million about a month ago.

19:05.258 --> 19:07.325
Got played on some restaurant thing.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.394
Guy on the other end
ran off with the cash.

19:09.429 --> 19:11.163
And Barton's still alive?

19:11.197 --> 19:13.231
He paid the money back.

19:13.266 --> 19:16.001
- He's got that kind of cash?
- He did till then.

19:16.035 --> 19:18.837
You saying he's broke now?

19:18.871 --> 19:21.573
He called one of my cousins'
people about an hour ago.

19:21.607 --> 19:24.876
Ernesto. He asked to borrow 500 grand.

19:37.256 --> 19:41.193
Ben Barton. Sit down.

19:41.227 --> 19:43.895
I told you they'd kill Cody
if I talked to cops.

19:43.930 --> 19:45.630
Hey, listen to me. It's all right.

19:45.665 --> 19:46.865
Nobody knows you're here.

19:46.899 --> 19:48.467
I just want to get my son back!

19:48.501 --> 19:50.569
So do we.

19:50.603 --> 19:53.805
We know you wash money
for gangs, we don't care.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.607
Not now, anyway.

19:58.811 --> 20:02.147
Look, I'm trying to do
what I can, but I'm broke.

20:02.181 --> 20:04.549
I can barely scrape together 100 grand,

20:04.584 --> 20:08.787
and none of my associates
are willing to help!

20:08.821 --> 20:11.056
All right. How much did they ask for?

20:11.090 --> 20:13.658
$1 million!

20:13.693 --> 20:17.896
The man said I had 48 hours or
he'd shoot Cody in the head.

20:17.930 --> 20:19.598
What time did you get the call?

20:19.632 --> 20:21.900
Yesterday. 2 p.m.

20:21.934 --> 20:25.737
All right, we got 26 hours.
Listen to me.

20:25.771 --> 20:28.073
We will do everything in our power

20:28.107 --> 20:31.243
to help you save your son.

20:31.277 --> 20:33.645
But you gotta help us.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.733
- How you holding up, man?
- I'm okay.

20:43.768 --> 20:45.635
Hold on, let me get this. Yeah.

20:45.674 --> 20:46.941
How's your hand?

20:47.172 --> 20:50.007
It's fine. It was the right move.

20:50.042 --> 20:53.110
Yeah. It was a move.
I'm not sure if it was right.

20:53.145 --> 20:54.812
Pulled everything I could find on Luis.

20:54.846 --> 20:56.747
Psych history, medical, details on ops.

20:56.782 --> 20:58.282
Served in Iraq during the surge.

20:58.317 --> 21:00.251
Korengal Valley, '08.
Probably saw some...

21:00.285 --> 21:04.155
I did a tour there too.
I know what he saw.

21:04.189 --> 21:07.258
So that stuff you told Camila
about when you got back.

21:07.292 --> 21:09.093
Is that true?

21:09.127 --> 21:10.828
All right, talk to you later.
All right, man.

21:10.862 --> 21:12.763
This number's Antonio.

21:12.798 --> 21:14.432
He's talking to Lugo,

21:14.466 --> 21:17.602
trying to get his hands on 900K
so we can make the drop.

21:17.636 --> 21:20.438
We need you to ID these guys.

21:20.472 --> 21:23.040
Are these lookalikes?

21:23.075 --> 21:25.042
You want me to give Luis actual drugs?

21:25.077 --> 21:26.877
I'm assuming we all know that's illegal.

21:26.912 --> 21:29.847
We need an easy in. This is it.

21:29.881 --> 21:31.682
Just make sure your wire's off.

21:46.064 --> 21:49.300
What's up, man? Is Camila home?

21:49.334 --> 21:50.468
No. Working.

21:50.502 --> 21:52.370
Really? We were gonna hang out.

21:52.404 --> 21:54.839
Yeah, she was gonna help me
celebrate. I got fired.

21:54.873 --> 21:57.174
Apparently, I'm not friendly enough.

21:57.209 --> 21:59.644
Um... you know what time
she's coming back?

21:59.678 --> 22:02.313
You mind if I stick around,
wait for a while?

22:02.347 --> 22:04.682
Yeah, I do mind.

22:04.716 --> 22:06.050
I've been very respectful.

22:06.084 --> 22:07.985
You're a soldier, bro.

22:08.020 --> 22:10.321
I know what you've seen, done.

22:10.355 --> 22:12.390
My sister don't need another
person like that

22:12.424 --> 22:14.158
in her life, you know?

22:14.192 --> 22:16.594
All right, if that's how you feel,

22:16.628 --> 22:18.362
I'll back off, man.

22:18.397 --> 22:19.363
All right.

22:19.398 --> 22:20.731
Yeah, um...

22:20.766 --> 22:22.500
You want a drink, man?

22:22.534 --> 22:24.001
You wanna have a few shots?
I got a bottle of vodka.

22:24.036 --> 22:27.638
Help me celebrate. Come on.

22:30.876 --> 22:33.511
Damn, man. Simmons with the uh...

22:33.545 --> 22:35.112
With the face tic, yeah.

22:35.147 --> 22:37.081
I can't believe that guy
made it in country.

22:37.115 --> 22:40.584
He made it out, too.
A lot of people didn't.

22:40.619 --> 22:42.853
Hell of a lot that died that
didn't sign up, you know?

22:42.888 --> 22:44.789
Kids, the women.

22:44.823 --> 22:47.391
Yeah, kids are the worst.

22:48.827 --> 22:53.064
I still see this, uh...
this eight-year-old girl.

22:54.166 --> 22:57.868
I have nightmares about her.
Beautiful face, dark skin.

22:57.903 --> 22:59.470
- Eight?
- Mm-hmm.

22:59.504 --> 23:00.905
That's young.

23:00.939 --> 23:04.375
Yeah. My nine, it went
through a combatant,

23:04.409 --> 23:06.744
and then it went through a doorway,

23:06.778 --> 23:08.879
and it ripped open her neck.

23:11.516 --> 23:13.050
She didn't die right away, though.

23:13.085 --> 23:16.220
Now, if I slow down, I see her.

23:16.254 --> 23:17.988
And I see all of it. I see the valley.

23:18.023 --> 23:21.192
I see the kids, dogs.

23:22.627 --> 23:24.562
For me it's a 17-year-old.

23:24.596 --> 23:26.330
Kid used to kick it with us.

23:26.364 --> 23:28.899
Town leaders killed him with an IED.

23:28.934 --> 23:31.168
Nobody wanted to touch him after,

23:31.203 --> 23:34.605
so I scooped up the pieces.
Used a trash bag.

23:37.809 --> 23:39.977
Ain't never gonna leave us, man.

23:43.882 --> 23:47.418
Hey. Your friend Ryan is here.

23:51.389 --> 23:53.691
He said he was supposed to meet you.

23:57.963 --> 23:59.663
Okay.

23:59.698 --> 24:02.133
See you then.

24:03.535 --> 24:06.804
You were supposed
to meet Camila tonight?

24:06.838 --> 24:10.341
At the apartment?

24:10.375 --> 24:13.310
How come she didn't know that?

24:14.312 --> 24:17.181
'Cause I didn't tell her.

24:19.918 --> 24:21.685
Man, I was gonna show up.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.522
Be all vulnerable, charming.
She was gonna love it.

24:24.556 --> 24:26.657
I ended up talking about
all this depressing crap

24:26.691 --> 24:28.826
with your ugly ass.

24:37.169 --> 24:41.305
I should get going, though.

24:41.339 --> 24:44.208
Look, man. If you ever need
something to like

24:44.242 --> 24:46.811
take the edge off, I got you covered.

24:46.845 --> 24:48.512
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

24:48.547 --> 24:50.648
With what?

24:50.682 --> 24:53.050
Right now all I got on me is some Oxy.

24:53.084 --> 24:54.585
Yeah? How much you want for it?

24:54.619 --> 24:58.255
No, man. It's on the house.

24:58.290 --> 25:01.559
If you set me up with your
private security buddy.

25:03.295 --> 25:05.262
You know I don't really do
private security, right?

25:05.297 --> 25:06.597
Man, I don't care.

25:06.631 --> 25:08.232
I just need a job. Some excitement.

25:08.266 --> 25:10.167
I'm gonna lose my damn mind. Come on.

25:10.202 --> 25:12.503
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Deal.

25:12.537 --> 25:13.704
All right.

25:28.386 --> 25:31.055
It's a burn bag.

25:31.089 --> 25:32.723
Best I can do, Hank.

25:32.757 --> 25:35.860
Yeah, well Lugo already
approved the 1505 funds.

25:35.894 --> 25:37.461
Well, he made a mistake.

25:37.495 --> 25:39.597
Since the new reform
package went through,

25:39.631 --> 25:41.699
all requests for cash run through me.

25:41.733 --> 25:45.102
Unfortunately, I just signed
off 700K to Narcotics.

25:45.136 --> 25:47.371
Denny, listen to me.

25:47.405 --> 25:50.541
If I go to these people with
a bag full of phony cash,

25:50.575 --> 25:52.309
they're gonna kill this child.

25:52.344 --> 25:53.878
You know I suggest you slow down...

25:53.912 --> 25:56.741
There's an eight-year-old boy out there!

25:57.296 --> 25:59.416
You come in here with your ego?

25:59.632 --> 26:03.249
The hell is wrong with you?

26:04.089 --> 26:07.958
This 700K that I gave to Narcotics,

26:07.993 --> 26:10.160
that money's going to a cartel buy

26:10.195 --> 26:12.329
that's gonna take down three bosses...

26:12.364 --> 26:14.565
each one of them wanted
on multiple murders!

26:14.599 --> 26:17.101
Not to mention the dope
we'll get off the street!

26:17.135 --> 26:21.906
Dope that has caused 246 ODs!

26:21.940 --> 26:24.742
So that is where the cash is going.

26:24.776 --> 26:29.280
I wish we had another 900K
sitting around, but we don't!

26:30.715 --> 26:33.284
I know you've got a guy under.
You just have to figure out...

26:33.318 --> 26:35.753
I got it. You made your point.

26:38.723 --> 26:41.325
What, are you waiting around
for a thank you or a I'm sorry?

26:41.359 --> 26:44.161
'Cause it ain't coming.

26:44.195 --> 26:46.096
So you should probably go.

27:03.431 --> 27:05.683
Okay.

27:05.717 --> 27:07.551
How the hell did you get in here?

27:07.585 --> 27:09.219
The neighbor buzzed
me in since you didn't.

27:09.254 --> 27:10.955
You were supposed to
swing by this morning.

27:10.989 --> 27:12.623
- Yeah, well thing's changed.
- No, man. We made a deal

27:12.657 --> 27:14.224
and I already gave you my end.

27:14.259 --> 27:15.693
And you'll get your end too,
but not now.

27:15.727 --> 27:17.161
No, man. That's not how it's gonna work.

27:17.195 --> 27:18.662
A deal's a deal. So what's up?

27:18.697 --> 27:20.464
You made your damn point already, man.

27:20.498 --> 27:22.132
- I don't need a leash...
- Who the hell are you?

27:22.167 --> 27:24.068
It's my boy Ryan.
He was just stopping by.

27:24.102 --> 27:26.303
We were at Benning together.
He's a Ranger.

27:26.338 --> 27:27.471
And you thought today
would be a good day

27:27.505 --> 27:29.139
to have a little date?

27:34.412 --> 27:36.347
We're gonna go.

27:43.388 --> 27:45.522
Okay. Here we go.

27:47.926 --> 27:49.593
Okay.

27:49.627 --> 27:54.631
Victor, seven, three,
Nora, Andy, four, six.

27:54.966 --> 27:58.168
And nine, Mary, one, William,

27:58.203 --> 28:00.838
x-ray, five, one.

28:00.872 --> 28:04.875
Okay, first plate is
registered to a Josh Miller.

28:04.909 --> 28:06.744
28. No priors.

28:06.778 --> 28:10.347
Second plate is Marcus Tate. 25.

28:10.382 --> 28:12.049
Height and weight match
our college shooters.

28:12.083 --> 28:13.183
He's got two DUIs and an assault charge

28:13.218 --> 28:14.618
in the last two years.

28:14.652 --> 28:16.453
Angry guy. We could use something there.

28:16.488 --> 28:18.255
Marcus is former Army Infantry

28:18.289 --> 28:19.923
and Josh is a Marine vet.

28:19.958 --> 28:22.559
We got them.

28:22.594 --> 28:24.928
- You want us to pull Marcus?
- Yeah, if you guys pull him,

28:24.963 --> 28:27.231
I can get Luis to get Josh to use me.

28:27.265 --> 28:29.133
You get him out, I'm in.

28:29.167 --> 28:30.901
- No.
- No? What the hell

28:30.935 --> 28:32.736
- does that mean?
- It means it's too risky.

28:32.771 --> 28:34.571
You're not seeing straight.
You trust this guy,

28:34.606 --> 28:36.607
and you shouldn't.
You went offline at the club,

28:36.641 --> 28:38.575
- you punched a civilian.
- I didn't have a choice.

28:38.610 --> 28:41.879
- Yes, you did.
- All right, all right, enough.

28:45.083 --> 28:47.551
Okay. We pull Marcus.

28:47.585 --> 28:48.652
Sarge.

28:48.686 --> 28:50.654
This is our only play, Hailey.

28:50.688 --> 28:53.257
Okay. We're done talking.

29:32.078 --> 29:34.037
You know you should never
come to this place

29:34.087 --> 29:35.421
in the daytime, right?

29:35.625 --> 29:36.992
It doesn't look good without makeup.

29:37.152 --> 29:38.519
Wait, what do you mean makeup?

29:38.746 --> 29:40.947
Hundred people in a drug haze.

29:41.129 --> 29:44.932
Oh. Oh yeah, it's definitely
depressing in here.

29:45.020 --> 29:47.321
Heard you've been hanging
with my brother.

29:47.355 --> 29:50.925
Yeah, we're talking
a few work type things.

29:50.959 --> 29:52.126
Do you know where I could find him?

29:52.160 --> 29:53.794
Oh, that's why you're here.

29:53.828 --> 29:55.262
For a second, I thought it was for me.

29:55.297 --> 29:57.698
Nope, it's all about Luis. Sorry.

29:57.732 --> 29:59.900
Ouch.

30:01.036 --> 30:02.336
Okay, you know what?

30:02.370 --> 30:06.106
Actually it's 50% Luis and it's 50% you.

30:06.141 --> 30:07.942
But just between you and me,

30:07.976 --> 30:10.110
he's not excited about you
hanging out with an ex-Ranger.

30:10.145 --> 30:11.712
No?

30:11.746 --> 30:16.483
Yeah, well, I make my own decisions.

30:27.896 --> 30:29.530
I do need to talk to him, though.

30:29.564 --> 30:30.664
Do you know where I could find him?

30:30.699 --> 30:32.032
That's your response?

30:32.067 --> 30:33.901
I'm sorry, I say really stupid things

30:33.935 --> 30:37.071
when beautiful women kiss me
out of the blue. You're right.

30:37.105 --> 30:39.406
Try Donahue on Wells.

30:39.441 --> 30:40.774
Thank you.

30:46.915 --> 30:48.849
What, are you stalking me now?

30:48.883 --> 30:51.185
No, man. Your sister said you'd be here.

30:51.219 --> 30:54.188
What's wrong with you?
You look terrible, man.

30:54.222 --> 30:56.156
It's fine, I...

30:59.761 --> 31:01.829
My boss is freaking.

31:01.863 --> 31:03.564
Third guy apparently left town.

31:03.598 --> 31:05.165
They got a job in an hour.

31:05.200 --> 31:08.102
That's great, man. Tell him to use me.

31:08.136 --> 31:11.205
- He's not gonna use you.
- You don't know that.

31:11.239 --> 31:13.040
He's gonna want to use me over nobody.

31:13.074 --> 31:14.241
Right? He's not gonna want
to change his tact plan.

31:14.275 --> 31:16.043
All you gotta do is convince him.

31:16.077 --> 31:17.745
And you sure as hell don't look
like you want to do

31:17.779 --> 31:20.748
whatever this is with just him.

31:20.782 --> 31:22.216
Now we've had the same training,

31:22.250 --> 31:23.751
so you know I'm gonna have your back.

31:23.785 --> 31:25.252
It's gonna be like any other op.

31:25.286 --> 31:28.122
If you don't want to go in alone, don't.

31:32.127 --> 31:34.294
- I don't know him from Jack.
- I do.

31:34.329 --> 31:36.296
You think that that means something?

31:36.331 --> 31:38.932
Man, it's him or nothing.
You want six eyes?

31:38.967 --> 31:40.801
Look, you guys can keep
arguing about me,

31:40.835 --> 31:42.870
or you can tell me what you want.

31:42.904 --> 31:44.705
I'm here to do you a favor.
Tell me yes or no.

31:44.739 --> 31:46.640
I'm not gonna waste my time.

31:46.675 --> 31:49.576
He's not gonna waste his time.

31:51.146 --> 31:54.581
Okay. You want the plan?

31:54.616 --> 31:56.617
I'm gonna make a call,
then we're gonna go.

31:56.651 --> 31:59.086
It's a simple security job.
Gonna get a location,

31:59.120 --> 32:00.988
a photograph of the man
we're gonna meet,

32:01.022 --> 32:03.290
You keep a bead on his
forehead the whole time.

32:03.324 --> 32:05.059
When I say it's time to leave,
you leave.

32:05.093 --> 32:06.560
Think you can handle that?

32:06.594 --> 32:07.961
Yeah, I can handle it.

32:07.996 --> 32:11.131
This is on you.

32:13.368 --> 32:14.902
Is that all he's gonna tell me?

32:14.936 --> 32:16.303
That's all he's gonna tell me?

32:16.337 --> 32:18.872
- You'll be fine.
- Are you kidding me?

32:20.375 --> 32:22.976
What is that? What are you doing?

32:23.011 --> 32:24.578
- It's one pill.
- No! No, man.

32:24.612 --> 32:26.613
No, no, no, no. This is not happening.

32:26.648 --> 32:28.348
I'm gonna do this thing
with you, all right?

32:28.383 --> 32:29.983
But I'm not going in there blind

32:30.018 --> 32:31.618
with you jammed out of your mind,

32:31.653 --> 32:33.120
so tell me something.
Give me some details, man.

32:33.154 --> 32:34.521
I can't give you any details, man.

32:34.556 --> 32:36.323
- Tell me what the job is!
- I can't!

32:36.357 --> 32:38.892
I'm useless to you! Come on!

32:40.028 --> 32:43.497
Fine, it's a K&R, all right?

32:43.531 --> 32:46.133
Kid's elsewhere. We're just
picking up the money.

32:46.167 --> 32:47.768
- Simple.
- You kidnapped somebody?

32:47.802 --> 32:49.503
- Hey, lower your voice!
- Are you...

32:49.537 --> 32:51.505
It's fine. Simple.

32:51.539 --> 32:55.109
There's not one thing
linking any of this to us.

32:55.143 --> 32:57.144
The kid's being held.
I don't know where.

32:57.178 --> 32:59.346
With one of Josh's connects,
I don't know who.

32:59.380 --> 33:01.682
Guy doesn't even have a phone,
all right?

33:05.053 --> 33:06.720
There's no way in hell I'm saying that!

33:06.755 --> 33:09.423
Listen, this is our best...

33:11.025 --> 33:14.194
This is our only shot.

33:14.229 --> 33:17.131
Look, I know neither of you know me,

33:17.165 --> 33:19.867
but you can trust me.

33:19.901 --> 33:22.669
This is what I do for a living.

33:27.041 --> 33:30.344
Look, I lost my son.

33:30.378 --> 33:33.180
And I promise you I'm doing
everything I can

33:33.214 --> 33:35.579
to make sure you don't.

33:42.524 --> 33:44.725
- Hello?
<i>- Right now, you're gonna</i>

33:44.759 --> 33:47.895
<i>drive to Grant Park.
Michigan and Eighth Street.</i>

33:47.929 --> 33:50.564
<i>On the corner, you're going
to see a red trash can.</i>

33:50.598 --> 33:53.534
<i>You walk to that can,
you put the money in that can,</i>

33:53.568 --> 33:55.169
<i>and you walk away.</i>

33:55.203 --> 33:57.104
<i>You get in your car, and you drive home.</i>

33:57.138 --> 34:00.607
<i>You follow these instructions,
and we will release your son.</i>

34:00.642 --> 34:02.976
<i>Do you understand?</i>

34:04.712 --> 34:07.514
<i>Do you understand me, Ben?</i>

34:11.485 --> 34:12.920
No!

34:12.954 --> 34:14.353
No, I'm not giving you anything.

34:14.389 --> 34:15.722
I'm not giving you a damn thing.

34:15.757 --> 34:17.491
I'm calling the police!

34:29.103 --> 34:31.205
God!

34:31.239 --> 34:33.607
Let me ask you something,
if he axes this,

34:33.641 --> 34:35.409
does he kill the kid?

34:35.443 --> 34:37.710
We've done this before,
all right? It's...

34:37.745 --> 34:38.978
Don't tell me it's fine!

34:39.013 --> 34:41.348
He's gonna kill this kid, isn't he?

34:42.183 --> 34:43.784
Listen, if I gotta convince you

34:43.818 --> 34:45.118
where you need to be on this,

34:45.152 --> 34:47.387
then so be it! We are not killing a kid!

34:47.422 --> 34:49.623
We're gonna stop this,
do you understand me?

34:49.657 --> 34:52.559
We can't stop it.
I don't know where the kid is.

34:52.594 --> 34:55.295
Even if I did, anyone who goes
through that door

34:55.330 --> 34:58.232
that's not Josh, they're getting shot.

34:58.266 --> 34:59.967
So what? So what?

35:00.001 --> 35:02.236
How many doors have we gone through?

35:03.504 --> 35:08.008
Not another kid, man.
I can't carry another kid.

35:08.042 --> 35:09.476
Can you?

35:09.510 --> 35:11.111
Luis!

35:13.648 --> 35:17.017
No, no, no. Not you. You stay there!

35:17.051 --> 35:18.819
- The mission's over.
- What?

35:18.853 --> 35:20.587
- It's over.
- So, what...

35:20.622 --> 35:24.024
- You know it is.
- So we gotta kill everyone?

35:24.058 --> 35:27.027
I don't want to kill everyone, man.

35:27.061 --> 35:28.528
Give me your phone.

35:28.563 --> 35:29.830
Why?

35:29.864 --> 35:32.165
Give me your phone.

35:37.171 --> 35:39.373
Now give Luis your gun.

35:39.407 --> 35:42.442
Hey... hey, I'm not giving you my gun.

35:42.477 --> 35:43.651
Relax, we're just going for a ride.

35:43.706 --> 35:45.151
- I'm not giving you my gun, Luis.
- Shut up, man.

35:45.176 --> 35:46.644
You're not getting it, man.

35:47.048 --> 35:50.317
Ryan, give me your gun.

35:50.351 --> 35:53.020
You know what's about to go down.

35:53.691 --> 35:57.094
Give me your gun. Get in the damn car.

36:25.829 --> 36:27.764
<i>Get out.</i>

36:28.599 --> 36:30.934
I'm not getting out of the car.

36:31.969 --> 36:34.771
You get out, or we get you out.

36:45.282 --> 36:47.917
We gotta tie him up, come on.

36:48.900 --> 36:50.836
He's got this place wired up.
There's a camera right there.

36:50.893 --> 36:52.237
He probably already knows we're here.

36:52.294 --> 36:54.162
All right, then we move fast.
I got your back.

37:02.471 --> 37:04.305
Cover.

37:08.444 --> 37:10.745
Move.

37:10.779 --> 37:13.014
Stay on me. Stay on me. Watch out.

37:19.255 --> 37:21.956
I want my mom!

37:49.118 --> 37:50.285
Cover!

37:54.223 --> 37:56.491
Police officer.
Let's get you out of here.

37:56.525 --> 37:57.692
Come on, let's go!

38:01.397 --> 38:02.964
Chicago PD!

38:10.639 --> 38:12.607
Ryan!

38:12.641 --> 38:14.208
Luis!

38:14.243 --> 38:15.310
Take him down!

38:17.479 --> 38:18.980
You're okay.

38:33.729 --> 38:36.297
Come on!

38:36.332 --> 38:38.333
Jay.

38:38.367 --> 38:39.667
Come on.

38:39.702 --> 38:42.170
Jay!

38:42.204 --> 38:43.371
Jay!

38:45.240 --> 38:47.041
Jay!

38:53.248 --> 38:54.716
No!

39:14.136 --> 39:16.170
- I got it.
- He's really okay!

39:16.205 --> 39:17.839
- He's really all right?
- He's fine.

39:17.873 --> 39:19.173
I don't know how I can
ever... I owe you!

39:19.208 --> 39:20.675
You don't owe me anything right now.

39:20.709 --> 39:22.043
We'll talk about all that later.

39:22.077 --> 39:24.545
- Go see your son, Ben.
- Mom! Dad!

39:29.485 --> 39:32.353
Yeah.

39:33.722 --> 39:36.457
- See you back at the district?
- Yeah.

40:05.087 --> 40:07.422
This is it, okay?

40:07.456 --> 40:10.324
I couldn't get the bug planted,
but that right there...

40:10.359 --> 40:12.326
it's enough for a case
of official misconduct,

40:12.361 --> 40:13.928
so you and me, we're good.

40:13.962 --> 40:15.830
You're gonna tell me when we're good?

40:15.864 --> 40:20.902
I've done everything you've
asked, so... yeah!

40:20.936 --> 40:23.604
Just let my sister off the hook.

40:23.639 --> 40:25.473
Please.

40:25.507 --> 40:27.442
Young people like you
hang around Hank Voight

40:27.476 --> 40:29.911
long enough, you start thinking
he's real police.

40:29.945 --> 40:33.581
Old timer. Tough. Invincible.

40:33.615 --> 40:36.951
Rubs off on you a bit, huh?

40:37.719 --> 40:41.556
Who in the hell do you think it
is taught him to be that way?

40:44.460 --> 40:47.862
You don't talk to me like that ever.

40:47.896 --> 40:50.598
And you and me are not good.

40:51.533 --> 40:53.634
Until I say we are.

41:34.109 --> 41:36.878
Did you hear?
I mean, I don't understand.

41:36.912 --> 41:38.513
None of it makes sense. The police said

41:38.547 --> 41:40.047
they were with some guy and they were...

41:40.082 --> 41:43.818
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

41:43.852 --> 41:47.054
Were you there?

41:50.526 --> 41:53.194
Ryan!

41:54.863 --> 41:57.198
No, I wasn't.

41:59.067 --> 42:00.668
Come in, Ryan.

42:10.502 --> 42:15.502
