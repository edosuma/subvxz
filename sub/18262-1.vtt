00:30.299 --> 00:32.267
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:32.366 --> 00:36.861
the motion picture you are about to see
is called The Naked City.

00:36.972 --> 00:41.068
My name is Mark Hellinger.
I was in charge of its production.

00:41.176 --> 00:46.341
And I may as well tellyou frankly that it's
a bit different from most films you've ever seen.

00:46.448 --> 00:49.474
It was written by Albert Maltz
and Malvin Wald...

00:49.584 --> 00:53.645
photographed by William Daniels
and directed by Jules Dassin.

00:54.790 --> 00:57.850
As you see,
we're flying over an island.

00:57.959 --> 01:00.325
A city. A particular city.

01:00.429 --> 01:05.890
And this is a story of a number of people -
and a story also ofthe city itself.

01:06.001 --> 01:10.370
It was not photographed in a studio.
Quite the contrary.

01:10.472 --> 01:12.406
Barry Fitzgerald, our star...

01:12.507 --> 01:14.737
Howard Duff, Dorothy Hart...

01:14.843 --> 01:18.142
Don Taylor, Ted de Corsia
and the other actors...

01:18.246 --> 01:22.046
played out their roles on the streets,
in the apartment houses...

01:22.150 --> 01:25.017
in the skyscrapers
of New York itself.

01:25.120 --> 01:30.456
And along with them, a great many thousand
New Yorkers played out their roles also.

01:30.559 --> 01:32.857
This is the city as it is.

01:32.961 --> 01:36.192
Hot summer pavements,
the children at play...

01:36.298 --> 01:38.562
the buildings in their naked stone...

01:38.667 --> 01:41.227
the people, without makeup.

01:43.472 --> 01:46.168
Well, let's begin our story this way.

01:46.274 --> 01:49.266
It's 1:00 in the morning
on a hot summer night...

01:50.312 --> 01:53.406
and this is the face of New York
when it's asleep.

01:54.549 --> 01:58.041
Or as nearly asleep as any city ever is.

01:58.153 --> 02:00.986
Bad hunting on Wall Street at night.

02:01.089 --> 02:03.319
No bulls. No bears.

02:03.425 --> 02:05.359
No lambs.

02:05.460 --> 02:08.725
A bank is a lonely place at this hour.

02:08.830 --> 02:12.129
And even a theater has lost its magic.

02:12.234 --> 02:16.728
A question: Do the machines
in a factory ever need rest?

02:16.838 --> 02:19.204
Does a ship ever feel tired?

02:19.307 --> 02:22.834
Or is it only people
who are so weary at night?

02:23.945 --> 02:26.038
There is a pulse to a city.

02:27.249 --> 02:29.342
And it never stops beating.

02:30.819 --> 02:34.016
And some people
earn their bread at night.

02:34.122 --> 02:39.287
Sometimes I think this world
is made up of nothing but dirty feet.

02:40.595 --> 02:43.189
It's wonderful working on a newspaper.

02:43.298 --> 02:45.266
You meet such interesting people.

02:45.367 --> 02:48.302
You put on a record. You take it off.

02:48.403 --> 02:53.500
You put on another. Does anyone
listen to this program except my wife?

02:55.143 --> 02:57.373
And while some people work...

02:57.479 --> 03:00.448
others are rounding off
an evening of relaxation.

03:09.591 --> 03:13.152
And still another is at the close of her life.

03:17.232 --> 03:21.430
- Let's go.
- Don't be a fool. This has gotta be sure.

03:23.572 --> 03:25.597
- Lift her up.
- What you gonna do?

03:37.052 --> 03:39.987
A hot night has worked its way toward dawn.

03:42.357 --> 03:45.053
Texas beef for New York markets.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.527
Uncle Harry's letter gets an early start.

03:50.432 --> 03:53.492
Everything as usual.
The morning routine.

03:56.271 --> 03:59.331
And even this, too, can be called routine...

03:59.441 --> 04:01.375
in a city of eight million people.

04:05.180 --> 04:07.842
I done a lot of things...

04:10.519 --> 04:12.987
but I never killed nobody.

04:15.557 --> 04:19.322
I'm gonna stay drunk a long time.

04:22.464 --> 04:27.231
I don't know what I'm gonna
say to God when my time comes.

04:29.471 --> 04:33.601
He's got a big heart, I'm told,
but he don't like -

04:35.677 --> 04:37.702
Thought you were off the liquor.

04:37.812 --> 04:40.747
Liquor is bad.
Weakens your character.

04:40.849 --> 04:45.218
How can a man like me
trust a liar like you?

04:46.288 --> 04:48.256
I can't.

04:56.731 --> 05:00.189
It's an hour later now. 6:00 a.m.

05:08.276 --> 05:10.836
Some babies are 8:00 babies.

05:10.946 --> 05:14.143
Some babies are 7:00 babies.

05:14.249 --> 05:17.446
Why do you have to be a 6:00 baby?

05:22.490 --> 05:24.390

05:49.818 --> 05:52.981
- Uh, good-bye, Mrs. Halloran.
- Good-bye, Mr. Halloran.

05:53.088 --> 05:56.387
Ah, come on, you little Indian.
On your horse.

05:56.491 --> 06:00.291
- See ya tonight, Mac.
- So long, bud.

06:02.664 --> 06:04.632
- Hello, Mr. Halloran.
- Hi, kids.

06:04.733 --> 06:07.566
Gonna be a scorcher today.

06:07.669 --> 06:11.127
Yeah. So next week,
I'll get my vacation, it'll be freezin'.

06:12.240 --> 06:15.141
She went to Jones's Beach last night, had a picnic.

06:15.243 --> 06:17.404
- With her boyfriend?
- Yeah.

06:17.512 --> 06:20.072
- Did he get fresh again?
- Yeah.

06:20.181 --> 06:23.378
Gee. She was born with a silver spoon.

06:30.692 --> 06:33.593
For this woman, the day will not be ordinary.

06:37.966 --> 06:42.232
Martha Swenson.
Forty-two years old. A widow.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.903
Lives a quiet life as a houseworker.

07:04.225 --> 07:06.193
Miss Dexter.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.880
Yes. Yes.

07:34.989 --> 07:37.219
What's your name, please?

07:37.325 --> 07:39.225
Thank you.

07:59.614 --> 08:01.582
Hello.

08:05.954 --> 08:07.922
Hello.

08:11.593 --> 08:13.561
The 10th Precinct Station...

08:13.661 --> 08:15.993
is in the Chelsea District of New York.

08:16.097 --> 08:19.157
A rather shabby building
on a rather shabby street.

08:19.267 --> 08:24.068
Acts of violence in Manhattan
are reported to the third floor of this building.

08:24.172 --> 08:26.163
Because here, rather quietly...

08:26.274 --> 08:28.174
the Homicide Squad does its work.

08:28.276 --> 08:30.870
Sometimes I wonder
what the human heart is made out of.

08:30.979 --> 08:33.379
My wife, rest her soul...

08:33.481 --> 08:36.712
always said she'd rather look into
a man's heart than into his head -

08:36.818 --> 08:38.876
that you could tell more about him.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.952
- Just came in, Captain.
- Morning, Lieutenant.

08:43.057 --> 08:44.957
Hi, Dave.

08:45.059 --> 08:47.493
You're free, aren't you, Dan?

08:47.595 --> 08:49.927
Haven't had a hard day's work
since yesterday.

08:50.031 --> 08:52.591
- Woman drowned in a bathtub.
- Who's to do my legwork?

08:52.700 --> 08:55.567
- How about young Halloran again?
- All right. I like the boy.

08:55.670 --> 08:58.764
- How's he doing?
- He's making the same mistakes I made at his age.

08:58.873 --> 09:00.841
That's too bad.
I thought he showed promise.

09:03.945 --> 09:05.313
It's them! Here they come!

09:05.348 --> 09:06.439
It's them! Here they come!

09:13.087 --> 09:15.317
- Elevator's straight ahead, Lieutenant.
- Thanks.

09:22.964 --> 09:25.797
- Who's on the job here?
- Sergeant Shaeffer, 20th Squad.

09:28.536 --> 09:31.664
- Morning, Lieutenant.
- Hi, Shaeffer. Well, what's the story?

09:31.773 --> 09:34.970
Dead woman's name was Jean Dexter,
26 years old, unmarried.

09:35.076 --> 09:38.273
She used to be a dress model
at Grace Hewitt's on West 57th Street.

09:38.379 --> 09:42.076
Parents live in Lakewood, New Jersey.
The name is Batory. That's Polish.

09:42.183 --> 09:45.380
Her name used to be Mary Batory
until she came to New York.

09:45.486 --> 09:47.852
The ambulance doctor
said she died of drowning.

09:47.956 --> 09:49.856
That's all I have.

09:49.958 --> 09:51.926
- This her?
- Yeah.

09:55.296 --> 09:57.890
Martha Swenson, the woman's housekeeper.
She found the body.

09:57.999 --> 10:00.991
Mr. Harvey - he's the house superintendent.
He called headquarters.

10:01.102 --> 10:03.070
- Where's the body?
- In there.

10:08.543 --> 10:10.534
Didn't this woman
drown in a bathtub, Doctor?

10:10.645 --> 10:12.840
She was on the bed when I got here.

10:14.215 --> 10:17.378
You come to work the same time every day?
- Every day except Thursday.

10:17.485 --> 10:19.476
- That's my day off.
- Who moved the body?

10:21.089 --> 10:25.719
Oh, when I came and saw her like that in the tub,
I called Mr. Harvey here. He helped me.

10:25.827 --> 10:29.126
You should have waited for the police.
Both of you should have known better.

10:29.230 --> 10:32.461
- I was so upset.
- Dan. Say, Dan.

10:32.567 --> 10:35.661
I found a bottle of pills under the bed.
Looks like sleeping pills.

10:35.770 --> 10:38.637
- Let me see 'em.
- I left them there.

10:38.740 --> 10:42.267
Well, thankyou for that, Jimmy.
This is moving day around here.

10:42.377 --> 10:44.675
I thought maybe you caught the fever.

10:44.779 --> 10:47.839
Uh, about the pills -
Maybe the dame took an overdose.

10:47.949 --> 10:51.612
Jimmy, it's our obligation
to wait for the medical examiner.

10:51.719 --> 10:56.952
He's a learned physician employed by the city
to determine the cause of mysterious deaths.

10:57.058 --> 10:59.026
Let the good man earn his money.

11:01.963 --> 11:05.126
No accident. No suicide.

11:05.233 --> 11:08.031
Bruises on her throat,
shoulders and arms.

11:08.136 --> 11:13.039
Those slight burns around her mouth
and nose were caused by chloroform.

11:13.141 --> 11:16.076
She was anesthetized,
after a struggle...

11:16.177 --> 11:18.441
then dumped into the tub alive.

11:18.546 --> 11:21.811
- How do you know that, Doctor?
- By the white foam around her mouth.

11:21.916 --> 11:24.146
It's proof she drowned.

11:24.252 --> 11:27.016
- New?
- New.

11:27.121 --> 11:29.089
- Okay, Lieutenant?
- Okay, Doctor?

11:29.190 --> 11:31.886
- The body's yours.
- Start working, gentlemen.

11:33.361 --> 11:35.522
Just smudges.

11:40.835 --> 11:42.803
Dan.

11:45.173 --> 11:48.040
Men's pajamas.
Found them in the laundry hamper.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.076
No visible laundry marks. No label.

11:50.178 --> 11:52.806
Real fancy.
You don't get these for 3.95.

11:52.914 --> 11:57.442
Nick, pick up these pajamas on yourway out.
I want them checked right down the line.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.652
What time does the elevator boy
come on in the morning?

12:01.756 --> 12:04.884
- 7:00.
- Martha, who belongs to these?

12:04.993 --> 12:08.087
Oh, I don't know, sir.
I'm so unstrung.

12:08.196 --> 12:10.756
I know you are,
but I think you'd like to help us.

12:10.865 --> 12:12.833
Oh, I would. I would.

12:12.934 --> 12:18.804
She was such a sweet girl. A little wild
by my standards maybe, but live and let live, I say.

12:18.906 --> 12:21.773
- She always treated me fine.
- The pajamas, Martha.

12:21.876 --> 12:25.437
- Oh, I'm all in pieces.
- Martha.

12:26.614 --> 12:30.380
Well, they could belong
to Mr. Henderson.

12:31.419 --> 12:33.614
What's Mr. Henderson's first name?

12:33.721 --> 12:36.815
Uh, Philip, I think.
He lives in Baltimore.

12:36.924 --> 12:40.052
At least that's what she told me.
I only saw him once.

12:40.161 --> 12:43.426
All I know is he was
an admirer of Miss Dexter's.

12:43.531 --> 12:47.331
- Seems likely.
- Oh, I'm all in little pieces. What a nightmare.

12:47.435 --> 12:50.165
You're being a great help to us, Martha.

12:50.271 --> 12:52.205
How old would you say Mr. Henderson is?

12:52.306 --> 12:54.365
Oh, 50 about.

12:54.475 --> 12:58.275
- What does he look like?
- Well, like I say, I only saw him once.

12:58.379 --> 13:01.212
He was coming in just as I was going home.

13:01.315 --> 13:05.115
He's quite tall.
On the thin side.

13:05.219 --> 13:07.483
Anything else?
Uh, does he wear glasses? Does he -

13:07.588 --> 13:10.580
- Oh, no, no. That's all I can remember.
- Mm-hmm.

13:11.692 --> 13:14.490
- Do you know Henderson?
- Never saw him.

13:14.595 --> 13:17.257
- Shoot a wire on this to Baltimore.
- Lieutenant.

13:18.566 --> 13:22.093
Here's the ring she was wearing.
I'll phone you after the autopsy.

13:22.203 --> 13:24.467
- Have fun.
- Always do.

13:28.609 --> 13:33.478
Sir, that ring -
it's a black star sapphire. Very rare.

13:33.581 --> 13:36.015
She said her brother
sent it to her from India.

13:36.117 --> 13:39.052
- Did she have any other jewelry?
- Oh, a lot.

13:39.153 --> 13:41.951
Valuable.
She kept it in a jewel box - locked.

13:42.056 --> 13:44.490
- Let's go get it.
- No.

13:44.592 --> 13:46.560
Please.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.629
Okay. You can pick up
that bottle under the bed now.

13:51.732 --> 13:54.200
- Check.
- That one there.

13:54.302 --> 13:57.499
- Nick, can we open a drawer on this table?
- Yeah, I've gone over it.

13:57.605 --> 14:00.699
- What are you doing to the furniture?
- Investigating it.

14:02.777 --> 14:06.440
Oh, she had chamois bags
full of bracelets and rings - diamond rings!

14:06.547 --> 14:09.015
- They're gone.
- Can you describe the jewelry?

14:09.117 --> 14:12.382
- Well, most of it, I think.
- Fine. Shaeffer, will you -

14:12.487 --> 14:14.614
Yes, sir.

14:14.722 --> 14:16.952
Pretty little slumber pellets.

14:17.058 --> 14:20.550
Jimmy, I want to go on questioning
those two in there. You start your legwork.

14:20.661 --> 14:23.061
Take the number of that prescription,
see the druggist.

14:23.164 --> 14:27.533
From him, go to the doctor.
Then go to the dress shop she worked at.

14:27.635 --> 14:29.603
Right.

14:31.239 --> 14:35.608
- Lieutenant, the newspapermen are here.
- Okay. I'm comin'.

14:35.710 --> 14:38.804
- Getting any fingerprints, Nick?
- Nothing good so far.

14:38.913 --> 14:41.211
Fragmentary print smudges.
That's all.

14:41.315 --> 14:45.046
Looks to me like a heavy case.
A heavy case.

14:48.222 --> 14:51.385
An investigation for murder is now underway.

14:51.492 --> 14:54.222
It will advance methodically,
by trial and error...

14:54.328 --> 14:57.195
by asking a thousand questions
to get one answer...

14:57.298 --> 14:59.391
by brain work and legwork.

14:59.500 --> 15:03.402
When it comes to legwork,
Detective Jimmy Halloran is an expert.

15:03.504 --> 15:07.804
In the war, he walked
halfway across Europe with a rifle in his hand.

15:07.909 --> 15:11.777
Up until three months ago,
he was pounding a beat in the Bronx.

15:11.879 --> 15:15.542
And now he's playing button, button
in a city of eight million people.

15:16.584 --> 15:19.314
No, the druggist can't remember
Miss Dexter personally.

15:19.420 --> 15:21.479
He'll have to look up the prescription.

15:27.195 --> 15:29.095
Oh, yes. Here it is.

15:29.197 --> 15:32.360
The doctor's name was Lawrence Stoneman,
office in the Chaffee Building.

15:32.466 --> 15:36.835
The Chaffee Building, Halloran.
Eighteen blocks south, four blocks west.

15:38.573 --> 15:41.940
Nick.

15:42.043 --> 15:44.170
How you doin'?

15:44.278 --> 15:47.145
Not too bad.
Found these two hairs in the rug.

15:47.248 --> 15:49.910
Mm-hmm. Getting any fingerprints?

15:50.017 --> 15:52.247
- Nothing good yet.
- Thanks.

15:53.321 --> 15:58.953
Martha, aside from Mr. Henderson,
did Miss Dexter have any other men friends?

15:59.060 --> 16:03.520
None that I know of, sir.
Just this Niles man. Frank Niles.

16:03.631 --> 16:05.622
Oh, lovely man.

16:05.733 --> 16:07.860
- What are you doing?
- Don't mind me.

16:07.969 --> 16:10.437
Just admiring your hair.

16:32.860 --> 16:34.851
Is Dr. Stoneman in?

16:34.962 --> 16:38.056
- Do you have an appointment?
- I'm from the police department.

16:38.165 --> 16:41.566
- It's quite important.
- Follow me, please.

16:54.048 --> 16:57.745
There's your city, Halloran. Take a good look.

16:57.852 --> 17:01.720
Jean Dexter is dead, and the answer
must be somewhere down there.

17:01.822 --> 17:05.087
Yes, sir. What can I do for you?
Have a seat.

17:05.192 --> 17:08.752
Thank you. I want to ask you
about a patient of yours.

17:08.863 --> 17:10.990
- Jean Dexter.
- Dexter?

17:11.098 --> 17:14.534
You wrote a prescription for her
about two weeks ago - sleeping pills.

17:14.635 --> 17:19.163
Yes. A blonde girl.
Very handsome. I remember now.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.537
Dexter.
You from the local precinct, Officer?

17:21.642 --> 17:24.974
- Homicide.
- Oh, don't tell me that girl murdered someone.

17:25.079 --> 17:27.877
- Someone murdered her.
- What?

17:27.982 --> 17:30.041
- When?
- Last night sometime.

17:30.151 --> 17:32.051
What do you want to know?

17:32.153 --> 17:34.815
Well, whatever you can tell me about her.

17:34.922 --> 17:36.981
She needed a good spanking.

17:37.091 --> 17:39.787
Took stimulants by day
and needed sleeping pills at night.

17:39.894 --> 17:43.352
I told her to go slow,
but, no, life was too short for her.

17:44.398 --> 17:47.731
Can you tell me anything
about the way she lived, her friends?

17:47.835 --> 17:51.362
No. Nothing.
I saw her only that one visit.

17:52.840 --> 17:55.001
Well, I guess that's all, Doc.

17:55.109 --> 17:57.077
Thank you.

17:59.613 --> 18:03.344
The dress shop is next, Halloran.
Grace Hewitt's on West 57th Street.

18:05.486 --> 18:07.920
Imagine me in that.

18:08.022 --> 18:10.115
I can't imagine.

18:10.224 --> 18:13.751
In the Waldorf-Astoria,
with Franky singin'.

18:13.861 --> 18:15.829
I can't imagine.

18:15.930 --> 18:19.593
Oh, you! You're so uncooperative
I could slam you.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.998
Somewhere in the back
ofher pretty head...

18:22.103 --> 18:25.595
was the fixed notion that
she couldn't be happy without being rich.

18:25.706 --> 18:30.006
I don't think Jean ever would have married
unless the man had money - real money.

18:30.111 --> 18:32.079
Why did you fire her?

18:32.179 --> 18:34.170
Gentlemen sometimes
come here with their wives.

18:34.281 --> 18:38.115
When Jean Dexter modeled, many of them
left my shop a little too interested in her.

18:38.219 --> 18:40.153
Their wives didn't like it.

18:40.254 --> 18:43.382
- And neither did I.
- I see.

18:43.491 --> 18:47.359
Mmm, can I talk to her friend now -
the model you spoke about?

18:47.461 --> 18:49.656
Ruth Morrison?
Yes, I'll call her.

18:50.798 --> 18:53.665
- It's gettin' late. We better go.
- So what if we're late?

18:53.768 --> 18:56.635
- The boss'll holler.
- Let him holler. Strengthen his lungs.

18:56.737 --> 19:00.298
Miss Morrison, I understand
you modeled with Jean Dexter.

19:00.408 --> 19:03.002
Do you know anybody
who has cause to dislike her?

19:03.110 --> 19:05.010
- No.
- How about Mrs. Henderson?

19:05.112 --> 19:07.012
Who's she?

19:07.114 --> 19:10.049
Well, Mr. Henderson and Miss Dexter
are quite friendly, aren't they?

19:10.151 --> 19:12.346
She never told me
of a man named Henderson.

19:12.453 --> 19:15.616
- Are you sure?
- Really, Mr. Halloran. Jean's my friend.

19:15.723 --> 19:19.784
I don't think I want to answer any more questions
unless you tell me why you're asking them.

19:20.828 --> 19:23.126
She was found dead this morning.

19:26.867 --> 19:28.767
Hey! Look at the whale!

19:28.869 --> 19:31.497
A whale should stay underwater!

19:31.605 --> 19:33.539
Hey!

19:33.641 --> 19:36.667
I'll slayya!
I'll cut your heads off!

19:36.777 --> 19:38.677
- Stop, you cowards!
- Such language!

19:38.779 --> 19:40.679
In front of a police station too.

19:40.781 --> 19:42.749
Ah, you -

19:46.153 --> 19:48.087
No report yet on fingerprints...

19:48.189 --> 19:51.249
and, uh, Constantino's on his way
to Lakewood to see the girl's parents.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.258
Um -

19:55.129 --> 19:57.120
Got Frank Niles, Lieutenant.

19:57.231 --> 19:59.825
Have him in.

19:59.934 --> 20:03.631
Thank you for coming down, Mr. Niles.
I'm Lieutenant Muldoon.

20:03.737 --> 20:06.638
Bring Mr. Niles a chair.
This is Sergeant Miller.

20:06.740 --> 20:09.038
How do you do?

20:09.143 --> 20:11.941
I've, uh, never been in
a police station before.

20:12.046 --> 20:15.243
- Why'd you want to see me, Lieutenant?
- Just a routine check on something.

20:15.349 --> 20:20.810
Did you ever run
across a girl named, uh, Dexter?

20:20.921 --> 20:23.719
Jean Dexter?
Why, yes. We're good friends.

20:23.824 --> 20:26.918
- And how long have you known her?
- A little over a year.

20:27.027 --> 20:29.928
She's a model. She helps me out
in my business occasionally.

20:30.030 --> 20:32.498
- And what business is that?
- Merchandising consultant.

20:32.600 --> 20:37.196
I, uh, help out-of-town buyers get woolens,
dress skirts - anything in the textile line.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.431
And you pay Miss Dexter a salary?

20:39.540 --> 20:42.941
No. Just a bonus from time to time
when she does something.

20:43.043 --> 20:47.002
- Like what?
- Uh, modeling, entertaining somebody for me.

20:47.114 --> 20:50.982
- When did you see her last?
- Yesterday. We had lunch together.

20:51.085 --> 20:53.019
Why?

20:53.120 --> 20:56.521
- And you haven't seen her since?
- No.

20:56.624 --> 20:58.649
Is there anything the matter?

20:58.759 --> 21:00.283
She's dead.

21:01.562 --> 21:03.530
Murdered.

21:12.206 --> 21:14.106
- Hi, Perelli.
- Hiya.

21:14.208 --> 21:16.199
Just sit here a moment, please.

21:17.578 --> 21:19.705
- Dan here?
- Inside talking to the guy.

21:19.813 --> 21:21.781
Lieutenant Muldoon.

21:23.050 --> 21:25.644
Dan? Jimmy. Got a girl here.

21:25.753 --> 21:29.689
Ruth Morrison.
Friend of Dexter's. Models at Grace Hewitt's.

21:29.790 --> 21:31.758
Hold it. I'll call her.

21:32.826 --> 21:34.726
This is terrible.

21:34.828 --> 21:37.296
I feel sick over it.

21:37.398 --> 21:40.526
My hands haven't trembled like this
since I was in the South Pacific.

21:40.634 --> 21:43.797
- Oh? What happened to you there?
- Oh, my first time in combat.

21:43.904 --> 21:46.304
- What outfit were you in?
- 77th.

21:46.407 --> 21:49.740
Say, I think I had a cousin in that one.

21:49.843 --> 21:52.209
- It's a New York division, isn't it?
- Yes.

21:52.313 --> 21:54.804
Corporal James Dennis.

21:54.915 --> 21:58.043
No. I don't remember him.
I was a captain.

21:58.152 --> 22:01.144
Thank you, Dave.
We won't need you anymore.

22:01.255 --> 22:03.223
Excuse me.

22:04.725 --> 22:08.855
We want to find the person
who murdered Jean Dexter, Mr. Niles.

22:08.963 --> 22:10.931
Anything I can tell you.

22:12.266 --> 22:15.099
You know anybody who might have
had a reason to kill her?

22:15.202 --> 22:17.762
Everybody liked Jean.

22:17.871 --> 22:23.002
Do you happen to know a friend
of Miss Dexter's called Ruth Morrison?

22:23.110 --> 22:26.204
Ruth Morrison? No.

22:26.313 --> 22:28.543
Yes. She's a model, isn't she?

22:28.649 --> 22:31.584
Yeah. I think so.
How well do you know her?

22:31.685 --> 22:34.882
Oh, I - I met her at parties
once or twice that Jean gave.

22:34.989 --> 22:37.014
And how long did you know Miss Dexter?

22:37.124 --> 22:39.092
About a year.

22:39.193 --> 22:42.185
- See her often?
- Why, yes. I, uh -

22:44.164 --> 22:47.429
- Frank, why are you here?
- Why, uh, hello, Ruth.

22:48.569 --> 22:52.232
You don't think he could have been involved
in Jean's death. He hardly knew her.

22:52.339 --> 22:55.866
- How do you know?
- Well, of course I know. Frank and I are engaged.

22:55.976 --> 22:58.444
Congratulations.

23:03.550 --> 23:07.816
The items that make up
this murder are being compiled now.

23:07.921 --> 23:12.051
They'll be listed in a folder
marked "Dexter, Jean"...

23:12.159 --> 23:14.389
along with some questions.

23:14.495 --> 23:16.554
Is Henderson the murderer?

23:16.664 --> 23:20.498
Did a taxicab take him
to the Pennsylvania Railroad Station?

23:22.703 --> 23:25.968
Who is Henderson?
Where does he live?

23:26.073 --> 23:28.098
Who knows him?

23:28.208 --> 23:30.802
"Bulletin. Police chief.
Baltimore, Maryland.

23:30.911 --> 23:33.641
"Please ascertain information
about resident, your city.

23:33.747 --> 23:36.113
"Name: Philip Henderson.
Age: about 50.

23:36.216 --> 23:38.116
"Thin, tall build.

23:38.218 --> 23:40.243
"Confidential. Quick Reply. Urgent.

23:40.354 --> 23:43.414
Correspondence Bureau,
Police Department, New York City."

23:44.658 --> 23:48.924
Along with Henderson,
one Frank Niles is now in the case.

23:49.029 --> 23:52.226
Every murder turns on a bright hot light...

23:52.332 --> 23:54.926
and a lot ofpeople,
innocent or not...

23:55.035 --> 23:58.368
have to walk out of the shadows
to stand investigation.

24:02.509 --> 24:04.568
I might be wanti ng to see you again.

24:04.678 --> 24:07.203
Anytime you say. Jean was my friend.

24:07.314 --> 24:09.714
And you won't leave town
without letting me know?

24:09.817 --> 24:12.786
- Oh, all right. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

24:14.054 --> 24:16.522
- Lovely young girl, isn't she?
- Yeah.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.750
- Lovely long legs.
- Yeah.

24:18.859 --> 24:20.850
- Keep looking at 'em.
- Pleasure.

24:26.567 --> 24:28.558
Yeah.

24:28.669 --> 24:30.899
Uh-huh. Thanks.

24:31.939 --> 24:35.466
Couple of things.
One: medical examiner called in.

24:35.576 --> 24:38.374
- Dexter died between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m.
- I see.

24:38.479 --> 24:40.640
And, uh, here...

24:40.748 --> 24:43.444
are a few interesting items
on our friend inside.

24:49.823 --> 24:53.281
- Mr. Niles.
- These things happen, Lieutenant.

24:53.393 --> 24:57.489
I told you I didn't know Ruth Morrison very well.
Now you know that Ruth and I are engaged.

24:57.598 --> 25:01.466
Can't blame a man forwanting
to keep his fiancée out of a murder case, can you?

25:01.568 --> 25:04.230
I never had a fiancée in a murder case.

25:04.338 --> 25:06.272
Just between ourselves...

25:06.373 --> 25:10.673
you never told your fiancée what good friends
you and Miss Dexter were, did you?

25:10.778 --> 25:12.871
Uh, Ruth's a bit jealous, Lieutenant.

25:12.980 --> 25:14.948
You understand.

25:16.717 --> 25:19.550
Now I wonder if there's anything else
you told us about yourself...

25:19.653 --> 25:22.383
that wasn't strictly true.

25:22.489 --> 25:24.980
I have no reason to lie to you, Lieutenant.

25:26.026 --> 25:30.656
I have a report in front of me that says
you never were in the South Pacific, Mr. Niles.

25:31.765 --> 25:34.825
You weren't in the 77th Division.

25:34.935 --> 25:36.994
You weren't an officer.

25:37.104 --> 25:39.368
You weren't even in the army.

25:39.473 --> 25:41.373
All right. I'm a heel.

25:41.475 --> 25:43.375
I tried to enlist.
Theywouldn't take me.

25:43.477 --> 25:46.139
I got a trick knee from college football.
I just couldn't get in.

25:46.246 --> 25:48.840
That's all right with me,
but why lie about it?

25:48.949 --> 25:50.849
I don't know.

25:50.951 --> 25:53.146
Just foolish pride, I guess.

25:53.253 --> 25:56.745
How did you spend the war years,
Mr. Niles?

25:56.857 --> 25:59.917
I was in Chicago.
Same business I have now.

26:00.027 --> 26:03.656
- Been at it long?
- Six or seven years - since college.

26:03.764 --> 26:06.824
- Doing pretty well, huh?
- Very good these days.

26:08.168 --> 26:10.159
Perelli back? Send him in.

26:13.841 --> 26:17.072
Well, what can you tell us
about Mr. Niles's business?

26:18.111 --> 26:20.011
He ain't got a business.

26:22.616 --> 26:25.779
It's a dodge.
No credit rating.

26:25.886 --> 26:29.845
Dropped from his university club
for nonpayment of dues.

26:29.957 --> 26:34.690
Still owes a food and liquor
bill of $110.83.

26:38.031 --> 26:39.999
All right. Thank you.

26:48.408 --> 26:52.037
Well, Mr. Niles,
I've been 38 years on the force.

26:52.145 --> 26:55.945
I've been a cop on the beat.
I've been with the Safe and Loft Squad.

26:56.049 --> 26:59.416
I've been for 22 years
with the Homicide Squad.

26:59.519 --> 27:03.285
But in a lifetime of interrogatin'
and investigatin'...

27:03.390 --> 27:07.451
you are probably the biggest
and most willing liar I ever met.

27:08.729 --> 27:13.291
All right. I'm a liar. I'm a circus character
altogether, but I didn't kill Jean Dexter!

27:13.400 --> 27:16.233
I told you where I was last night.
Why don't you check on that?

27:16.336 --> 27:18.395
- We're doing that right now.
- Okay. That's fine.

27:21.041 --> 27:23.009
I'm sorry.

27:23.110 --> 27:26.273
I'm not angry at you, Lieutenant.
You're just doing your job.

27:26.380 --> 27:28.871
The truth is I'm ashamed of myself.

27:30.817 --> 27:33.411
My parents had money and position.

27:34.454 --> 27:38.288
But since I got out of college
I haven't been much of a success.

27:38.392 --> 27:40.326
I'm trying to keep up a front.

27:40.427 --> 27:42.952
But I'm only a small-time liar, Lieutenant.

27:43.063 --> 27:45.463
On important things,
I'm straight as a die.

27:45.565 --> 27:48.762
Ask me anything you want.
Jean was my friend. I want to help you.

27:48.869 --> 27:53.363
You spent nearly $50 last night
at the Trinidad Club.

27:53.473 --> 27:55.566
Where'd you get the money?

27:57.978 --> 28:00.879
I play a sharp game of bridge
with Park Avenue friends.

28:00.981 --> 28:03.643
I take a flier on the stock market
on inside tips.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.945
When I'm hard up, I borrow money.

28:06.053 --> 28:07.953
That's the truth.

28:10.123 --> 28:12.023
Thank you.

28:12.125 --> 28:14.616
Now, about this man Henderson.

28:14.728 --> 28:17.856
You say you met him only once,
in Miss Dexter's apartment.

28:17.965 --> 28:23.699
- Would you describe him to me?
- Well, uh, medium height. Husky.

28:23.804 --> 28:27.934
- Wore glasses. Looked to be about 35.
- Mm-hmm.

28:30.477 --> 28:32.536
Lieutenant Muldoon.

28:32.646 --> 28:34.614
Yeah. Yeah.

28:36.717 --> 28:39.515
Oh. Oh, all right.

28:43.256 --> 28:46.817
Well, Mr. Niles, after telling me
a lot of stories about a lot of things...

28:46.927 --> 28:50.158
you apparently told me an accurate story
of where you were last night.

28:50.263 --> 28:55.860
Four witnesses have placed you
in the Trinidad Club at the time Jean Dexter died.

28:57.504 --> 28:59.438
I guess you're in the clear, Mr. Niles.

28:59.539 --> 29:02.235
I told you.
I don't lie about important things.

29:03.410 --> 29:06.607
- Any more questions?
- I guess not.

29:08.148 --> 29:11.549
I'm not as much of a heel
as I sound, Lieutenant.

29:11.651 --> 29:14.119
I'm trying to catch on
to a job in industry.

29:16.289 --> 29:18.587
Maybe someday I will.

29:18.692 --> 29:20.592
I wish you luck.

29:21.628 --> 29:23.596
- Good-bye then.
- Good-bye.

29:25.799 --> 29:27.824
Put two men on him in three shifts.

29:27.934 --> 29:30.994
And listen. Not a word about him
to the newspapermen.

29:31.104 --> 29:33.504
Niles isn't even in this case.

29:39.679 --> 29:43.843
Spent $50 last night, he says.

29:43.950 --> 29:47.147
On 50 bucks a week
I supported a wife and raised two kids.

29:47.254 --> 29:49.188
Sure.

29:49.289 --> 29:52.190
But you were brought up
on the wrong side of the tracks.

29:53.226 --> 29:55.126
Fifty bucks!

29:58.632 --> 30:00.964
It's been a long day, Niles.

30:01.068 --> 30:03.662
But now you can go whereveryou like.

30:03.770 --> 30:06.671
Except that two men
will follow you day and night.

30:06.773 --> 30:10.470
Two men in three shifts.
That makes six altogether.

30:16.283 --> 30:18.251
Or is it seven?

30:21.488 --> 30:25.857
The only good fingerprints we got
were of the maid and Jean Dexter.

30:25.959 --> 30:29.190
Several men from the 20th Squad
are still working on the case.

30:29.296 --> 30:34.962
The Baltimore Police say they can't locate anyone
so far who answers Henderson's description.

30:35.068 --> 30:38.629
And the pajamas in Dexter's apartment
show nothi ng under the X-ray.

30:38.738 --> 30:41.605
They're an English import
and never been washed.

30:41.708 --> 30:44.575
All stores that carry the line
are being checked.

30:44.678 --> 30:46.578
That's it, Captain.

30:46.680 --> 30:50.707
Very little to go on.
This man Niles - how's his alibi for last night?

30:50.817 --> 30:52.944
He seems in the clear.

30:53.053 --> 30:56.147
So does everyone else
we connected with so far.

30:56.256 --> 31:00.920
So, that means Mr. Henderson
is our only suspect.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.995
Well...

31:03.096 --> 31:05.223
what about this man?

31:06.266 --> 31:08.166
- Think so, Dan?
- Mm-hmm.

31:08.268 --> 31:10.168
Who's he?

31:10.270 --> 31:13.171
McGillicuddy is Dan's name
for any unknown party in the case.

31:13.273 --> 31:16.265
- You mean two men did the murder?
- Maybe there were five.

31:16.376 --> 31:19.641
- All I know is there was more than one.
- How do you know that?

31:19.746 --> 31:22.271
Excuse me. Now look.

31:22.382 --> 31:26.751
This is a bed.
For the moment, I'm an attractive little lady.

31:26.853 --> 31:30.186
How would you force the anesthetic
on me, Mr. Henderson?

31:30.290 --> 31:33.020
Well, I'd, uh, take the anesthetic -

31:33.126 --> 31:36.254
Uh, I guess the best way
would be to stand behind.

31:36.363 --> 31:38.331
Like this.

31:38.431 --> 31:41.958
Correct. That's the way
one man would do it.

31:42.068 --> 31:44.593
But we just got these photographs.

31:44.704 --> 31:47.264
They show finger marks
on both arms.

31:47.374 --> 31:50.639
That means a man stood behind her
and held her arms with both hands...

31:50.744 --> 31:53.645
while Henderson, or someone else,
applied the anesthetic.

31:53.747 --> 31:56.079
A strong man,
with thick, strong fingers.

31:56.183 --> 31:58.947
And that man was my old, old friend...

31:59.986 --> 32:02.352
Joseph P. McGillicuddy.

32:02.455 --> 32:04.355
You're right, Dan.

32:04.457 --> 32:06.391
Now we have to find two men.

32:06.493 --> 32:09.860
You'll have to find them.
I'm busywith a half a dozen other cases.

32:09.963 --> 32:12.727
- Gentlemen.
- So long.

32:12.832 --> 32:14.800
- Need me anymore?
- No.

32:14.901 --> 32:17.597
♪ Good-bye, Paddy ♪

32:17.704 --> 32:21.401
♪ No matterwhere you roam ♪

32:33.753 --> 32:36.950

32:38.992 --> 32:43.053
Say, Dan, there's an old dame outside,
says she can crack the Dexter case.

32:43.163 --> 32:45.131
Have her in.

32:48.902 --> 32:52.167
Are you the officer in charge of
the bathtub murder?

32:52.272 --> 32:54.240
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ah.

32:54.341 --> 32:57.970
- This one?
- Yes, ma'am.

32:58.078 --> 33:00.410
- I can help you solve it.
- Yeah?

33:00.513 --> 33:04.506
Yes. My granddaddy is sheriff
of Tuckahoe County. Mississippi.

33:04.618 --> 33:06.586
Your granddaddy?

33:06.686 --> 33:08.916
Yes.

33:09.022 --> 33:11.684
I'm only in my 20s, you know.

33:11.791 --> 33:15.283
- And very handsome you are too.
- Yes, I know.

33:15.395 --> 33:18.558
So many men are crazy about me. I -

33:18.665 --> 33:22.795
- I just don't know what to do.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

33:23.837 --> 33:26.567
- Bye now.
- Bye.

33:26.673 --> 33:28.971
Oh, yes.

33:29.075 --> 33:32.408
About your murder -
I almost forgot.

33:32.512 --> 33:36.642
We'll have to have the front tooth
of a hound dog.

33:36.750 --> 33:40.015
- Yes, ma'am.
- Bury it 50 feet from the grave.

33:40.120 --> 33:45.023
Then, on the third night after the first
full moon, the murderer will confess.

33:45.125 --> 33:47.025
Thank you, ma'am.

33:47.127 --> 33:50.824
Prices are awfully high
these days, aren't they?

33:50.930 --> 33:54.366
- Uh, uh, y-y-yes, ma'am.
- Yeah.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.435
You're sweet.

34:01.007 --> 34:02.975
Bye now.

34:12.152 --> 34:14.585
How much of that
have you had in 38 years?

34:14.688 --> 34:17.282
I couldn't count it.
Every time there's a headline case.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.415
We'll be lucky if there isn't a lot more.

34:19.525 --> 34:21.494
"You're sweet."

34:22.829 --> 34:25.525
Bye now.

34:25.632 --> 34:27.600
Bye.

34:29.936 --> 34:31.960
The day's work is over now.

34:32.072 --> 34:34.472
People are on their way home.

34:34.574 --> 34:38.408
They're tired.
They're hot. They're hungry.

34:38.511 --> 34:41.002
But they're on their way home.

34:42.716 --> 34:45.879
In the newspapers,
there's a new murder story.

34:45.985 --> 34:50.149
It's hit the headlines.
Full layout of pictures on page three.

34:52.559 --> 34:54.527
It's really quite sensational.

34:54.627 --> 34:56.527
It helps while away the time...

34:56.629 --> 34:59.223
when you live out in Jackson Heights.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.996
Must have had a hard day, brother.

35:03.103 --> 35:05.469
Don't bite your nails, honey.

35:05.572 --> 35:07.506
Very few stenographers are murdered.

35:08.541 --> 35:10.805
Read about that bathtub murder?

35:10.910 --> 35:14.209
I'll say. Some figure that dame had.

35:36.770 --> 35:39.500
Hello, honey.
Bet it was hot in Manhattan today.

35:39.606 --> 35:42.575
I was too busy to be hot.
On a new case.

35:42.675 --> 35:44.905
The subway was a furnace though. Wow.

35:45.011 --> 35:47.343
- You too warm to say hello?
- Mm-hmm.

35:51.518 --> 35:54.009
Got you a nice, cool dinner.
Jellied tongue.

35:54.120 --> 35:56.281
Oh, swell. I'm starved.

35:56.389 --> 35:59.415
Stop holding onto me, will ya, huh? Let me go.

35:59.526 --> 36:02.256
Let me go.

36:02.362 --> 36:05.195
- Where's Billy?
- I put him to bed.

36:05.298 --> 36:07.926
- So early?
- Listen, dear. I'm sorry to tell you this...

36:08.034 --> 36:10.366
but you've got
a nasty job to do before dinner.

36:10.470 --> 36:12.802
- What's the matter?
- Billy has to have a whipping.

36:12.906 --> 36:14.931
- Why?
- He walked right out of the yard...

36:15.041 --> 36:17.703
crossed Northern Boulevard
all by himself...

36:17.811 --> 36:19.711
and went to the park.

36:19.813 --> 36:22.304
Well. Well, I-I'll give him a real talking-to.

36:22.415 --> 36:25.282
Oh, no, you won't.
You'll give him a real whipping, with a strap.

36:25.385 --> 36:28.445
- Just a minute.
- I know you don't believe in whipping a child.

36:28.555 --> 36:30.455
- Well, neither did I until now.
- I -

36:30.557 --> 36:34.220
But do you want Billy run over by a truck?
Look, I've reasoned with him.

36:34.327 --> 36:36.227
I've pleaded with him.
I've threatened him.

36:36.329 --> 36:38.923
But the minute my back is turned,
he's off.

36:39.032 --> 36:42.195
Well, he's a - he's a spunky kid, Janey.

36:43.303 --> 36:45.703
I don't want him to be a dead kid.

36:45.805 --> 36:48.330
- No.
- Go on then.

36:48.441 --> 36:50.409
Get it over with.

36:51.544 --> 36:53.603
Yeah. Yeah. I guess I'd better.

36:56.316 --> 36:58.250
- Right after dinner.
- Jimmy.

36:58.351 --> 37:01.411
Look, honey. I just can't go up
there and take a strap to that boy.

37:01.521 --> 37:04.513
- I have to work up to it a bit.
- You'd think I was asking you to kill him.

37:04.624 --> 37:06.592
If you think it's easy, you whip him.

37:06.693 --> 37:09.719
- Me? That's not a woman's job.
- Why does it have to be a man's job?

37:09.829 --> 37:13.356
- It's always a man's job.
- Who says so?

37:18.671 --> 37:22.607
Hello. Oh, uh, yes, Dan. Yes.

37:22.709 --> 37:24.609
Right. Right away. Sure.

37:24.711 --> 37:26.770
That does it.
I have to meet Muldoon right away.

37:26.880 --> 37:29.678
- Without any dinner?
- Save it for me. I'll grab a hamburger meanwhile.

37:29.782 --> 37:32.546
Oh, I wish you were a -
an ice cream salesman or something.

37:32.652 --> 37:34.586
I don't like this night work.

37:34.687 --> 37:37.713
I don't like it every time
you strap on that gun.

37:37.824 --> 37:40.725
Ifl were an ice cream salesman,
I'd get fat.

37:40.827 --> 37:43.728
- Then you wouldn't like me.
- I don't like you now.

37:43.830 --> 37:46.697
Oh, yes, you do. Well -

37:46.799 --> 37:48.790
Remember. You've got a job to do
before you leave.

37:48.902 --> 37:50.369
- What?
- Billy.

37:50.470 --> 37:54.065
- Oh, I can't stop for that now, honey.
- Halloran, you're a coward.

38:27.874 --> 38:29.774
This is Lieutenant Muldoon.

38:29.876 --> 38:32.538
Mr. and Mrs. Batory,
the girl's parents.

38:33.980 --> 38:37.279
I told her.
I knew she'd turn out no good.

38:37.383 --> 38:42.082
All these young girls.
So crazy to be with the bright lights.

38:42.188 --> 38:46.022
- No bright lights for her now, is there?
- She's at rest now, Mrs. Batory.

38:46.125 --> 38:48.958
No. Her kind of dead don't rest.

38:49.062 --> 38:52.190
What about us? The scandal.

38:52.298 --> 38:56.667
My husband's a gardener. He works for
a banker - a highly respectable gentleman.

38:58.338 --> 39:00.306
He'll get fired now.

39:02.208 --> 39:04.938
I hate her. I hate her.

39:05.044 --> 39:08.980
- Paula.
- Never mind. I hate her. I say it out straight.

39:09.082 --> 39:11.073
So fancy she was.

39:11.184 --> 39:13.675
Even had to change her name.

39:13.786 --> 39:17.483
We'd better go in now.
Would you please follow the nurse.

39:39.212 --> 39:41.942
I do hate her. I do.

39:42.048 --> 39:45.882
I warned her.
A million times I warned her.

39:48.855 --> 39:52.621
I hate her.
I hate her for what she's done to us.

40:11.010 --> 40:13.877
Please tell me if she's your daughter.

40:26.025 --> 40:28.585
Oh! My baby!

40:28.695 --> 40:33.064
My baby! Oh, my baby!

40:56.889 --> 41:00.290
I feel better now.
The ride was good for me.

41:00.393 --> 41:02.657
Are you sure
you want to go home tonight?

41:02.762 --> 41:05.925
- We can get you a room at a hotel.
- We'll go home.

41:06.032 --> 41:10.401
We don't like this place -
this fine city.

41:10.503 --> 41:12.869
You don't know who did it, huh?

41:12.972 --> 41:14.940
Not yet.

41:15.041 --> 41:17.305
Did you ever see this ring?

41:19.278 --> 41:22.805
Your daughter told someone
it came from a brother in India.

41:23.883 --> 41:25.851
We only had her.

41:25.952 --> 41:28.079
No other kids. No boy.

41:28.187 --> 41:32.988
I see. Uh, did your daughter
ever mention a man called Henderson?

41:33.092 --> 41:34.992
We don't know any Henderson.

41:35.094 --> 41:38.621
We haven't seen Mary even for six months.
She was too busy to come see us.

41:38.731 --> 41:42.997
Who knows what she ran around with?
She's dead, Mama. Don't.

41:44.036 --> 41:46.561
A good girl. I swear it.

41:46.672 --> 41:49.664
It's my fault maybe
I didn't do better for her.

41:49.776 --> 41:52.176
When she was 15
she was workin' already.

41:52.278 --> 41:54.439
The five-and-ten-cent store.

41:54.547 --> 41:56.572
Oh, it was hard.

41:56.682 --> 41:59.116
Depression time. Hard.

41:59.218 --> 42:02.915
So what? She's the only one didn't have it easy?
Other people had it worse.

42:03.022 --> 42:06.719
Was that a reason to leave home,
to - to change your name?

42:06.826 --> 42:10.421
Wanting too much.
That's why she went wrong.

42:10.530 --> 42:14.557
Bright lights and theaters
and furs and nightclubs.

42:14.667 --> 42:16.726
That's why she's dead now.

42:17.770 --> 42:22.935
Dear God, why wasn't she born ugly?

42:23.042 --> 42:24.942
Mrs. Batory -

42:25.044 --> 42:27.171
Oh, what a heartache.

42:28.247 --> 42:31.808
You nurse a child, you raise it...

42:31.918 --> 42:34.478
pet it, you love it...

42:34.587 --> 42:37.988
and it ends like this.

42:44.096 --> 42:45.996
Another day...

42:46.098 --> 42:48.726
another ball of fire
rising in the summer sky.

42:49.836 --> 42:51.963
The city is quiet now...

42:52.071 --> 42:54.562
but it will soon be pounding with activity.

42:54.674 --> 42:58.940
This time yesterday, Jean Dexter
was just another pretty girl...

42:59.045 --> 43:03.072
but now she's the marmalade
on 10,000 pieces of toast.

43:05.618 --> 43:07.950
Hey, Mac. What's doin'?
Why all the people here?

43:08.054 --> 43:11.217
"What's doin'?" What's the matter?
You live in Canarsie or somethin'?

43:11.324 --> 43:13.417
This is the place
where that model was killed.

43:13.526 --> 43:15.892
You don't mean it. The bathtub girl, huh?

43:15.995 --> 43:17.895
So why didn't she take showers?

43:20.399 --> 43:23.163
There's no pattern yet to the Dexter case.

43:23.269 --> 43:26.295
Just a number of loose threads.

43:26.405 --> 43:30.273
When boys go swimming
in the East River, for example...

43:30.376 --> 43:32.310
why report it to the Homicide Squad?

43:32.411 --> 43:33.969
Look! Hey, look!

43:34.080 --> 43:37.174
Just routine. The morgue will take care of it.

43:40.086 --> 43:43.180
Nevertheless,
some things are moving forward.

43:44.357 --> 43:46.325
There'll be a report on this.

43:49.729 --> 43:51.629
- Dan.
- This is Dexter's address book.

43:51.731 --> 43:56.725
Contact every name I listed in it.
Keep asking if they heard her talk about Henderson.

43:56.836 --> 43:58.303
- Okay.
- Dan, I -

43:58.404 --> 44:00.304
Start in on this ring of Dexter's.

44:00.406 --> 44:03.739
Canvass every expensive jewelry shop
in the city.

44:03.843 --> 44:05.743
Maybe Henderson bought it for her.

44:05.845 --> 44:09.144
- Oh, my poor feet.
- Your poor feet?

44:09.248 --> 44:11.216
Be glad you're not a horseback cop.

44:12.685 --> 44:15.313
Well, what's with you?

44:15.421 --> 44:18.857
Niles sold this about an hour ago
to a jeweler on Madison Avenue.

44:18.958 --> 44:21.256
- Got $600 for it.
- Well!

44:21.360 --> 44:24.295
Dave, where's that list of stuff
that was stolen from Dexter?

44:27.199 --> 44:30.134
No, it couldn't be.

44:34.507 --> 44:36.475
No. Not here.

44:37.510 --> 44:39.478
It's a man's item anyway.

44:40.846 --> 44:43.178
An interesting man, that Niles.

44:43.282 --> 44:45.443
He operates very strange.

44:45.551 --> 44:48.076
Say, how about
I check this cigarette case...

44:48.187 --> 44:51.714
with the department list
of all jewelry stolen in the last year or so?

44:51.824 --> 44:54.691
All right. I don't think
you'll get anything though.

44:54.794 --> 44:59.561
He'd be crazy to unload a stolen item
in the middle of a hot case like this.

44:59.665 --> 45:01.633
Maybe he is crazy.

45:03.035 --> 45:05.003
Not that one.

45:07.707 --> 45:10.574
Hiya, Halloran. Here's a question for you.

45:10.676 --> 45:13.509
How many jewelry shops
in the city of New York?

45:13.612 --> 45:15.944
Be patient. You're about to find out.

45:16.048 --> 45:18.710
Hi, Officer. Just keep checking.

45:18.818 --> 45:20.979
Henderson didn't
weave those pajamas himself.

45:21.087 --> 45:23.282
Hello, Constantino.

45:23.389 --> 45:26.881
A detective finds himself in odd places,
doesn't he?

45:26.993 --> 45:29.086
How about a mudpack? No?

45:29.195 --> 45:31.163
Well, how about a permanent?

45:31.263 --> 45:33.390
Or, uh, how about those eyebrows?

45:33.499 --> 45:35.467
Ever have them plucked?

45:40.306 --> 45:43.901
Ask a question, get an answer.
Ask another.

45:44.010 --> 45:47.275
If Jean Dexter isn't remembered here,
check it off.

45:47.380 --> 45:50.076
You've got her address book, Constantino.

45:50.182 --> 45:52.742
Get going.

45:52.852 --> 45:56.549
How are your feet holding out, Halloran?
How are you doing with that ring?

45:56.655 --> 45:58.589
Would you be interested to learn...

45:58.691 --> 46:02.024
that there was a confession
in the Dexter case only 10 minutes ago?

46:06.599 --> 46:08.624
Lieutenant Muldoon, what's your hurry?

46:08.734 --> 46:12.261
There's been a confession.
The case is all washed up, isn't it?

46:15.408 --> 46:19.469
He's in there, Lieutenant. I caught him trying
to get in the kitchen by the back door.

46:19.578 --> 46:21.569
He's a grocery boy in the neighborhood.

46:26.719 --> 46:28.687
Yes, I did it.

46:28.788 --> 46:30.756
I killed her.

46:30.856 --> 46:32.756
I want to be punished.
I'm guilty.

46:32.858 --> 46:35.418
My hands are stained with her blood.

46:35.528 --> 46:37.496
Why'd you kill her?

46:37.596 --> 46:40.622
She deserved it.
For months I've been watching her.

46:40.733 --> 46:45.329
I'd come in here with packages,
and there she'd be, in her negligee.

46:45.438 --> 46:47.702
Beautiful. But no soul.

46:47.807 --> 46:49.707
Immoral.

46:49.809 --> 46:52.744
So I did it. I rid the world ofher.

46:52.845 --> 46:55.075
The knife you stabbed herwith -
where is it?

46:55.181 --> 46:57.342
You'll never find it.

46:58.384 --> 47:00.352
Never.

47:01.754 --> 47:04.416
I buried it.

47:04.523 --> 47:06.423
I buried it.

47:06.525 --> 47:09.050
Call Bellevue Hospital,
Psychiatric Department.

47:11.931 --> 47:14.399
It's 7:30 in the evening now.

47:14.500 --> 47:17.196
It's been a great day on the Dexter case.

47:17.303 --> 47:19.237
Developments: none.

47:19.338 --> 47:21.397
New clues: none.

47:21.507 --> 47:23.407
Progress: none.

47:23.509 --> 47:25.443
Ever try to catch a murderer?

47:25.544 --> 47:27.512
It has its depressing moments.

47:29.348 --> 47:31.475
I can't see you've m issed anything.

47:31.584 --> 47:34.747
Boss, I can always trust you
to comfort a man.

47:34.854 --> 47:38.153
- Any word today from Baltimore?
- No.

47:38.257 --> 47:41.624
And Henderson's pajamas
were bought last week in a shop on 34th Street.

47:41.727 --> 47:44.753
- Huh?
- But not by Henderson.

47:44.864 --> 47:46.832
ByJean Dexter.

47:47.933 --> 47:51.061
- A heavy case.
- It is that.

47:51.170 --> 47:53.104
That Niles fella is crazy.

47:53.205 --> 47:55.673
The cigarette case Niles sold this morning -
it's hot.

47:55.774 --> 47:58.402
- It was stolen from Dr. Lawrence Stoneman.
- Dexter's physician.

47:58.511 --> 48:00.979
Yeah. He reported a burglary
in his apartment in March.

48:01.080 --> 48:04.675
$2,800 worth of stuff.
None of it has ever shown up.

48:04.783 --> 48:08.275
Here it is on the department list
of stolen jewelry for the past year.

48:08.387 --> 48:12.551
And that's not all. Niles bought
a plane ticket for Mexico City - one way.

48:12.658 --> 48:15.525
- Leavin' when?
- Tomorrow noon. Want me to pick him up?

48:15.628 --> 48:18.028
- No. What else he do today?
- Had lunch with Ruth Morrison.

48:18.130 --> 48:20.621
They held hands for an hour.
She went back to the shop.

48:20.733 --> 48:22.894
He went to the Park Central
and had a swim.

48:23.002 --> 48:25.596
- He's at Toots Shor's now.
- Buyin' a plane ticket...

48:25.704 --> 48:27.672
pawnin' a stolen cigarette case -

48:27.773 --> 48:29.673
that's not smart.

48:29.775 --> 48:31.743
What is this man?
An amateur or something?

48:31.844 --> 48:35.405
That's it. That's what's in his heart.
Now I know.

48:35.514 --> 48:37.778
He's had no experience at bein' a crook.

48:37.883 --> 48:41.182
He's a scared college boy
way out in deep water.

48:41.287 --> 48:43.915
He's beginning to thrash around now.
He's in a panic.

48:44.023 --> 48:46.958
- Panic over what?
- I don't know yet, Sam. I don't know yet.

48:47.059 --> 48:48.959
And how does this man Stoneman figure?

48:49.061 --> 48:51.529
Why should Niles pawn a cigarette case
belonging to him?

48:51.630 --> 48:53.655
Dan! Dan. Captain.

48:53.766 --> 48:55.666
- I got somethin' maybe.
- About what?

48:55.768 --> 48:58.259
The black star sapphire that Dexter
was wearing when she was killed -

48:58.370 --> 48:59.997
- it didn't belong to her.
- Huh?

49:00.105 --> 49:02.335
She didn't buy it, and Henderson
didn't buy it for her.

49:02.441 --> 49:07.208
It belongs to a Mrs. Hylton, 478 Park Avenue.
I found a jeweler who repaired it for her.

49:07.313 --> 49:10.111
Start in a murder case
and we're up to our neck in stolen jewelry.

49:10.216 --> 49:12.707
Mrs. Edgar Hylton. There it is.

49:12.818 --> 49:17.016
Black star sapphire.
Part of a $6,200 robbery of her apartment.

49:17.122 --> 49:20.057
- Did you see this Mrs. Hylton?
- I thought you might wanna see her.

49:20.159 --> 49:22.059
Well, now, that was
considerate ofyou, Jimmy.

49:22.161 --> 49:24.356
We'll telephone the lady,
and we'll both go and see her.

49:24.463 --> 49:27.864
Have a beer on me, Sam,
and throw a pinch of salt over your shoulder.

49:27.967 --> 49:29.935
This case is beginnin' to move.

49:40.579 --> 49:42.513
Lieutenant Muldoon, police department.

49:42.615 --> 49:45.209
Mrs. Hylton is expecting you.
Come in, won't you?

49:53.125 --> 49:56.720
My, what a nice-looking young man.

49:56.829 --> 49:58.956
You're the lieutenant who telephoned me,
aren't you?

49:59.064 --> 50:01.828
- Did you get my jewels back?
- Is this one of them?

50:01.934 --> 50:04.801
Oh, yes, it is.

50:04.903 --> 50:07.371
Oh, wonderful!

50:07.473 --> 50:11.409
Oh, you're wonderful men.
Where's the rest?

50:12.478 --> 50:14.378
That's all we have.

50:14.480 --> 50:16.675
I'm so disappointed.

50:16.782 --> 50:18.682
Oh, but this is wonderful.

50:18.784 --> 50:22.083
I gave it to my daughter
when she graduated from college.

50:22.187 --> 50:24.314
She was heartbroken when -

50:24.423 --> 50:26.755
Oh, isn't it precious?

50:26.859 --> 50:29.384
I love to glitter.

50:29.495 --> 50:31.861
It's a fixation.

50:31.964 --> 50:34.125
You're such a nice young man.

50:34.233 --> 50:36.201
Oh, sit down, gentlemen.

50:36.302 --> 50:40.033
Get comfortable.
Young man, sit by me.

50:40.139 --> 50:44.235
Mrs. Hylton, is your daughter here?
I'd like to speak to her.

50:44.343 --> 50:46.811
She's due any minute for dinner.

50:46.912 --> 50:50.075
It's her night with Mama.

50:50.182 --> 50:54.414
One of those career girls -
has her own apartment, works.

50:54.520 --> 50:56.988
That's what you get when you
send them to Vassar.

50:59.458 --> 51:01.653
Mrs. Hylton, if she doesn't live with you...

51:01.760 --> 51:03.955
how is it her ring was stolen from here?

51:04.063 --> 51:07.362
But that was last December.
She was living with me then.

51:07.466 --> 51:10.094
I see.
Now, I wonder if, by any chance -

51:10.202 --> 51:13.603
Mother? I'm here.
Hello, Margaret.

51:13.706 --> 51:17.574
- Niles - he's the connection.
- Easy, lad. Easy.

51:19.011 --> 51:20.911
Mother -

51:21.013 --> 51:24.176
You told me your name was Ruth Morrison,
not Hylton.

51:24.283 --> 51:27.684
Well, Ruth's my daughter by a first marriage.
She kept her father's name.

51:27.786 --> 51:29.845
How do you know these men?

51:29.955 --> 51:32.822
They're investigating Jean Dexter's murder.

51:32.925 --> 51:35.086
Jean modeled with me at the shop, Mother.

51:35.194 --> 51:37.662
Imagine! Look, darling.

51:38.697 --> 51:40.665
- My ring!
- They brought it.

51:40.766 --> 51:44.293
- Aren't theywonderful?
- How did you get it?

51:44.403 --> 51:47.531
Your friend was wearing it
when she was murdered.

51:47.639 --> 51:50.107
- Jean?
- How did she get it?

51:50.209 --> 51:52.234
I was hoping your daughter
would tell us that.

51:52.344 --> 51:56.644
I have no idea.
It was stolen with the other things.

51:56.749 --> 52:01.345
What did you mean before when you said,
"Niles - he's the connection?"

52:01.453 --> 52:03.318
- I, uh -
- What did you mean, please?

52:03.422 --> 52:07.916
He was just wondering, miss,
how your ring came to be on her finger.

52:08.026 --> 52:09.994
You don't think Frank -

52:10.095 --> 52:12.529
Oh, but that's silly.

52:12.631 --> 52:15.657
- He hardly knew Jean.
- Of course.

52:16.702 --> 52:18.966
Sit down.

52:22.674 --> 52:24.869
Excuse me, miss.
Is that your engagement ring?

52:24.977 --> 52:27.571
- Yes.
- Can I look at it?

52:33.185 --> 52:35.085
Pearl in an old-fashioned setting.

52:35.187 --> 52:38.122
Huh. Unusual. Jimmy.

52:39.591 --> 52:41.491
What are you doing?

52:41.593 --> 52:44.756
I'm sorry, miss.
We're checking your ring to see if it was stolen.

52:44.863 --> 52:46.831
This is fantastic!

52:46.932 --> 52:50.527
Do you honestly think that either Frank or I
had anything to do with Jean's murder?

52:50.636 --> 52:53.901
- I'm only earning my salary, miss.
- Dan!

52:54.006 --> 52:56.065
When did Niles giveyou this ring?

52:57.109 --> 52:59.077
About six weeks ago.

53:01.280 --> 53:06.081
On January the 8th, Mrs. Charles Franklin,
382 Fern Avenue, New Rochelle...

53:06.185 --> 53:09.279
reported the loss of this ring in a robbery.

53:14.293 --> 53:17.057
- Niles in?
- Went in about a half an hour ago.

53:17.162 --> 53:19.392
- Alone?
- Yeah. Apartment 6E.

53:21.500 --> 53:24.196
- You can go home now.
- Thanks. I'm dead. So long.

53:24.303 --> 53:26.203
Good night.

53:34.480 --> 53:36.448
Niles!

53:38.884 --> 53:40.784
Niles!

53:40.886 --> 53:43.116
Stand back.

53:48.527 --> 53:50.893
Oh, Frank.

53:50.996 --> 53:53.658
- Darling.
- Dan, in here!

53:55.000 --> 53:57.491
It's the police! Stop or I'll shoot!

54:05.711 --> 54:08.544
What's the matter?
What's goin' on here? Who is that?

54:14.019 --> 54:15.919
Somebody get help!

54:16.021 --> 54:18.785
Help! Help!

54:21.593 --> 54:23.493
Help!

54:58.363 --> 55:00.354
Up there! He ran up there!

55:20.552 --> 55:22.986
Frank. Frank.

55:23.088 --> 55:24.988
Maybe some whiskey would help.

55:25.090 --> 55:27.456
Whiskey's not the thing
to mix with chloroform.

55:27.559 --> 55:31.256
Suppose you go into the kitchen and see
if there's a spot of coffee on the stove.

55:32.598 --> 55:34.566
It'll do fine, even if it's cold.

55:39.638 --> 55:41.868
Come on, me sleepin' beauty. Wake up.

55:45.243 --> 55:47.404
That's the sweet lad.

55:52.451 --> 55:55.909
- I found some cold tea.
- That'll do fine. He's wakin' up now.

55:56.021 --> 55:58.080
Oh, Frank, darling.

55:58.190 --> 56:00.420
- Are you all right?
- Hello, Ruth.

56:00.525 --> 56:03.153
Oh, sweetheart, I was so worried.

56:03.261 --> 56:05.320
Oh, my darling. My darling.

56:05.430 --> 56:07.523
The cold tea would do more good.

56:12.704 --> 56:15.229
- Got away... on the elevated.
- Did you give it to radio?

56:15.340 --> 56:17.274
- Sure.
- Get a look at him?

56:17.376 --> 56:19.970
No. He was a husky guy.
That's all I got.

56:20.078 --> 56:21.978
What is that?

56:22.080 --> 56:24.605
Same anesthetic that was used on Dexter.

56:24.716 --> 56:27.776
- I think this is our friend McGillicuddy again.
- Oh.

56:30.489 --> 56:34.084
Well, hello.
How are you feeling?

56:34.192 --> 56:36.387
I've got a head like a beehive.

56:37.529 --> 56:39.497
Is that towel wet?

56:40.666 --> 56:43.134
- Want any more tea, darling?
- No.

56:43.235 --> 56:45.931
While you're thinkin' up a nice story
about what didn't happen...

56:46.038 --> 56:48.233
supposin' you tell us what did.

56:48.340 --> 56:51.275
- I don't know.
- Complete blackout, huh?

56:51.376 --> 56:53.310
I was packing a bag...

56:53.412 --> 56:55.312
and I thought I heard a noise.

56:55.414 --> 56:58.281
And just as I started to turn around...

56:58.383 --> 57:00.283
I got hit.

57:00.385 --> 57:02.945
I remember falling to my knees...

57:03.055 --> 57:04.955
and that's all.

57:05.057 --> 57:08.857
Now listen, Niles. You came very close
to not waking up at all.

57:08.960 --> 57:13.260
The party that killed Jean Dexter
tried the same business on you.

57:13.365 --> 57:16.630
- Who was it?
- How on earth would I know?

57:16.735 --> 57:19.295
If you're afraid, I'll guarantee you
police protection.

57:19.404 --> 57:21.929
If I knew, I'd tell you.
I'm not a fool.

57:23.175 --> 57:25.075
You suppose I enjoyed this?

57:25.177 --> 57:27.407
Any guess who it was?

57:27.512 --> 57:29.742
Must have been a burglar.

57:29.848 --> 57:31.748
Came in through the fire escape,
I suppose.

57:31.850 --> 57:35.616
A burglar.
Maybe he stole something.

57:46.064 --> 57:47.964
He got it, didn't he?

57:48.066 --> 57:51.092
No. No, there's - there's nothing missing.

57:51.203 --> 57:53.103
I don't have any valuables.

57:53.205 --> 57:56.902
What were you looking for so hard just now?
Your B.V.D.'s?

57:57.008 --> 57:59.340
I thought - I, uh -

57:59.444 --> 58:01.469
I forgot this was in my pocket.

58:01.580 --> 58:04.105
It's, uh, my one valuable.

58:04.216 --> 58:06.116
It's - It's expensive.

58:09.387 --> 58:11.355
Jimmy.

58:20.732 --> 58:22.700
What are you doing?

58:25.537 --> 58:27.505
Why'd you come down here anyway?

58:29.341 --> 58:32.504
You wanna know something, Lieutenant?
You're gonna have a lawsuit on your hands.

58:32.611 --> 58:35.171
- You can't -
- Forrest C. Broughton, 85 West 68th Street...

58:35.280 --> 58:38.545
reported the loss of this cigarette lighter
three weeks ago.

58:38.650 --> 58:41.551
- Night burglary.
- What kind of a deal is this?

58:41.653 --> 58:43.553
You tell us.

58:43.655 --> 58:45.782
Ifyou think I'm a thief, you're crazy.

58:45.891 --> 58:48.382
Honey, this is the craziest thing
I ever heard of.

58:48.493 --> 58:50.757
Sweetheart...

58:50.862 --> 58:53.660
this is a terrible thing
to ask you right now.

58:53.765 --> 58:57.724
But my engagement ring -
where did you buy it?

58:57.836 --> 59:00.396
- What?
- Frank, darling, please.

59:00.505 --> 59:03.406
- Where did you buy it?
- It was from a private party.

59:04.476 --> 59:06.205
- Who, Frank?
- I can't tell you.

59:06.311 --> 59:07.938
Please, sweetheart. You must.

59:08.046 --> 59:11.345
- Where'd you get the cigarette lighter?
- I, uh -

59:11.449 --> 59:14.646
Where'd you get the cigarette case
you sold this morning?

59:17.289 --> 59:19.553
Frank, tell them.
Please tell them.

59:19.658 --> 59:22.058
Why'd you buy a plane ticket
for Mexico City?

59:23.395 --> 59:25.295
Why, I -

59:25.397 --> 59:27.991
What ticket? When?

59:28.099 --> 59:30.897
He was supposed to leave
at noon tomorrow.

59:31.002 --> 59:33.129
Is that true?

59:33.238 --> 59:35.172
- Frank, is it true?
- It was a business trip.

59:35.273 --> 59:37.798
- We had lunch today. Why didn't you -
- Something came up this afternoon.

59:37.909 --> 59:39.809
You're lying.

59:39.911 --> 59:42.209
You bought the ticket in the morning.

59:48.920 --> 59:51.912
You've got the wrong man ifyou think
I stole those things, Lieutenant.

59:52.023 --> 59:54.184
I wouldn't steal a piece of bread
if I was starving.

59:54.292 --> 59:57.090
That isn't the way I was brought up.
I come from a decent family.

59:57.195 --> 59:59.663
- Congratulations.
- I got that lighter as a present.

59:59.764 --> 01:00:01.732
You can't send me to prison for that.

01:00:01.833 --> 01:00:04.301
Who gave it to you?

01:00:04.402 --> 01:00:08.202
Jean Dexter.
Now you prove she didn't.

01:00:08.306 --> 01:00:11.366
- And the cigarette case you sold this morning?
- The same.

01:00:13.712 --> 01:00:17.443
- And my engagement ring?
- Sure. Jean gave me that too.

01:00:17.549 --> 01:00:19.483
- My engagement ring?
- You heard me.

01:00:19.584 --> 01:00:23.111
No, no, Frank. Don't say a thing like that.
That would be horrible.

01:00:23.221 --> 01:00:26.315
- And I know it's a lie. You hardly knew Jean.
- I'm sorry, Ruth.

01:00:26.424 --> 01:00:28.483
I don't believe you.

01:00:28.593 --> 01:00:31.756
Frank, I love you.
I'll marry you now - tonight.

01:00:31.863 --> 01:00:33.888
But say you're lying about Jean.

01:00:33.999 --> 01:00:37.765
- If you're a thief, I'll stand by you. I'll -
- And go to prison? In a pig's eye, I will.

01:00:37.869 --> 01:00:40.360
Those things were presents. Presents!
Your ring was a present -

01:00:40.472 --> 01:00:42.440
- Frank!
- from Jean.

01:00:43.909 --> 01:00:45.877
You're lying.

01:00:47.178 --> 01:00:50.306
You're lying! You're lying!

01:00:50.415 --> 01:00:52.975
You're lying! You're lying! You're lying!

01:00:53.084 --> 01:00:56.485
- You're lying.
- Niles, you're under arrest.

01:00:56.588 --> 01:00:58.579
Arrest me all you like!

01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:02.217
But try to prove something against me.
Try it! Just try it!

01:01:04.062 --> 01:01:07.156

01:01:07.265 --> 01:01:10.234

- With the alligator purse.

01:01:22.013 --> 01:01:24.243
- Dan?
- Yeah.

01:01:26.751 --> 01:01:30.152
I'm not sure, but -
but I think maybe I found a connection...

01:01:30.255 --> 01:01:32.815
between these jewel burglaries
and the Dexter murder.

01:01:36.428 --> 01:01:38.328
You have?

01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:40.864
Have you read the autopsy report
on Peter Backalis?

01:01:40.966 --> 01:01:42.866
- Not yet.
- Well, yesterday morning...

01:01:42.968 --> 01:01:45.402
some kids swimming in the East River
found a body.

01:01:45.503 --> 01:01:49.303
Medical examiner says he died of drowning.
Had a head injury and was full of whiskey.

01:01:49.407 --> 01:01:51.773
- His verdict is accidental death.
- Uh-huh.

01:01:51.876 --> 01:01:56.745
But look at this. Jean Dexter died between
1:00 and 2:00 a.m. Monday morning.

01:01:56.848 --> 01:02:01.148
This guy Backalis died between 3:00 and 6:00 a.m.
the same morning.

01:02:01.252 --> 01:02:03.516
Well...

01:02:03.621 --> 01:02:05.782
show me that it's more than a coincidence.

01:02:07.192 --> 01:02:10.628
I can't show you, Dan.
But this man had a record.

01:02:10.729 --> 01:02:13.129
He served two years in Sing Sing
for stealing jewelry.

01:02:13.231 --> 01:02:15.392
Now listen.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:19.561
Niles and Dexter were dealing
in stolen jewelry. Sure.

01:02:19.671 --> 01:02:22.469
But it was society stuff.

01:02:22.574 --> 01:02:26.476
- What does Backalis's record show?
- I didn't think of that.

01:02:28.013 --> 01:02:30.811
It was small-time -
a pawnshop burglary in Queens.

01:02:31.916 --> 01:02:34.146
See?

01:02:34.252 --> 01:02:37.449
I'm afraid the two cases are miles apart.

01:02:37.555 --> 01:02:41.787
If we drag every petty jewelry thief into this,
we'll go crazy.

01:02:49.467 --> 01:02:51.367
You're not convinced, are you?

01:02:51.469 --> 01:02:53.369
I don't know, Dan.

01:02:53.471 --> 01:02:55.439
Trouble is, where are we
in the Dexter case?

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:59.704
Well, we sent photos of Niles and Dexter
to every police department in the East.

01:02:59.811 --> 01:03:02.473
- They'll check all jewelers.
- Where can that lead?

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:04.810
Well, that's the way you run a case, lad.

01:03:04.916 --> 01:03:06.816
Step by step.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.020
Oh, I suppose so.

01:03:12.524 --> 01:03:14.424
Look, Dan, do me a favor.

01:03:14.526 --> 01:03:17.927
Let me waste some time
on this Backalis angle.

01:03:18.029 --> 01:03:19.929
- Okay, lad.
- Swell.

01:03:20.031 --> 01:03:22.329
- Phone in once a day.
- Right.

01:03:22.434 --> 01:03:25.699
By the way, this is only the third day
of the Dexter murder.

01:03:25.804 --> 01:03:28.238
The department
never calls a case unsolved.

01:03:28.339 --> 01:03:31.638
Good deal. Twenty years from now
I'll put my kid on it.

01:03:39.050 --> 01:03:41.712
Backalis's parole officer was Charles Meade,
county courthouse in the Bronx.

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:43.515
- Charles Meade?
- Yep.

01:03:43.621 --> 01:03:45.521
Thanks.

01:03:52.997 --> 01:03:56.433
Well, tell me this, Mr. Meade.
Do you think Backalis could get so drunk...

01:03:56.534 --> 01:03:59.935
he'd fall down on the pier, hurt himself
and topple into the river?

01:04:00.038 --> 01:04:04.270
I doubt it. He seemed like
one of those steady all-day drinkers -

01:04:04.375 --> 01:04:07.310
always with a load on, but neverwobbly.

01:04:07.412 --> 01:04:11.815
- Who was his arresting officer?
- Uh, Patrolman Albert Hicks.

01:04:11.916 --> 01:04:13.816
Long Island City Precinct.

01:04:13.918 --> 01:04:16.079
What do you know? Right at my doorstep.

01:04:17.122 --> 01:04:19.022
Thanks.

01:04:26.731 --> 01:04:28.961
- You're Hicks, aren't you?
- That's right.

01:04:29.067 --> 01:04:32.127
- Detective Halloran, Homicide Squad.
- Hiya.

01:04:32.237 --> 01:04:36.503
About two and a half years ago,
you arrested a man named Backalis.

01:04:36.608 --> 01:04:39.975
- Backalis?
- Peter Backalis. Pawnshop entry.

01:04:40.078 --> 01:04:43.980
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.
- Did he do that job alone?

01:04:44.082 --> 01:04:45.982
No, there was another guy with him.

01:04:46.084 --> 01:04:48.552
- A fella he called, uh, Willie.
- Willie?

01:04:48.653 --> 01:04:50.644
- Yeah.
- What happened to him?

01:04:50.755 --> 01:04:53.155
He got away by the neatest trick
I've ever seen.

01:04:53.258 --> 01:04:57.524
I nailed Backalis in a back alley.
And he yelled, "Beat it, Willie!"

01:04:57.629 --> 01:05:01.463
And this other customer throws a chair
through a plate glass window...

01:05:01.566 --> 01:05:04.592
dives right after it and comes up
on his feet like an acrobat.

01:05:04.702 --> 01:05:06.602
Then he's off like a streak.

01:05:06.704 --> 01:05:11.198
- How was this fella built?
- Oh, big... Like an all-American fullback.

01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:13.573
And listen.
Somethin' funny about him.

01:05:13.678 --> 01:05:17.273
One of the things the owner
reported missing was a harmonica.

01:05:17.382 --> 01:05:20.442
Now, there's no resale value
in a thing like that...

01:05:20.552 --> 01:05:23.783
so I always figured
he must have liked to play one.

01:05:24.822 --> 01:05:26.722
Maybe you're right.

01:05:26.824 --> 01:05:28.792
- Much obliged.
- Okay.

01:05:29.928 --> 01:05:31.828
Mm-hmm.

01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:34.490
A big man who's an acrobat, huh?

01:05:35.533 --> 01:05:38.969
Jimmy, I don't know where you're goin',
but I'm goin' to start in and help you.

01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:42.039
I'm givin' you Fowler and Constantino
beginnin' tomorrow morning.

01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:44.108
Thanks, Dan.

01:05:44.209 --> 01:05:46.177
Good night.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.547
His name is Willie... maybe.

01:05:51.649 --> 01:05:55.813
He might have been
a professional acrobat... maybe.

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.684
He might be the man
we're looking for... maybe.

01:05:59.724 --> 01:06:01.988
Oh, yes. He's a big man.

01:06:02.093 --> 01:06:04.618
Only half a million big men in New York.

01:06:06.231 --> 01:06:08.461
A harmonica player?

01:06:08.566 --> 01:06:10.466
No, sir, brother.

01:06:10.568 --> 01:06:14.095
Why, a character like that,
I wouldn't even let work out here.

01:06:17.275 --> 01:06:19.334
Not that I can remember.

01:06:19.444 --> 01:06:24.006
I been bookin' vaudeville acts, circus acts,
nightclub acts for 30 years.

01:06:24.115 --> 01:06:25.707
Oh, a lot of queer eggs among 'em...

01:06:25.817 --> 01:06:28.115
but an acrobat
that played the harmonica?

01:06:28.219 --> 01:06:30.881
That queer I never saw one.

01:06:34.025 --> 01:06:35.652
Offense.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.991
Defense. Give, give, give.

01:06:39.097 --> 01:06:40.997
Offense.

01:06:41.099 --> 01:06:42.999
Now go to work a little.

01:06:46.104 --> 01:06:48.004
Hey, who runs this joint?

01:06:48.106 --> 01:06:50.006
- I do. What do you want?
- Police.

01:06:51.042 --> 01:06:54.603
Look. Any of you guys ever know a wrestler
who liked to play the harmonica?

01:06:54.712 --> 01:06:56.703
Sure. Willie the harmonica player.

01:06:56.814 --> 01:06:59.408
Willie Garzah. I teached him how to wrestle.

01:06:59.517 --> 01:07:02.714
You didn't teach him so good.
I pulverized him in Pittsburgh five years ago.

01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:04.981
- Where is he now?
- I wish I knew.

01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:07.523
He borrowed 38 bucks from me once.
Never paid me back.

01:07:07.625 --> 01:07:09.559
- Where'd he used to live?
- I don't know.

01:07:09.661 --> 01:07:11.720
Staten Island, with his brother.

01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:13.888
What's his brother's name?

01:07:13.998 --> 01:07:16.694
Garzah.
All brothers got the same name.

01:07:18.169 --> 01:07:22.663
- I mean his first name.
- Uh, I don't know.

01:07:22.774 --> 01:07:24.674
Okay.

01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:27.610
Offense.

01:07:27.712 --> 01:07:30.078
Defense.

01:07:34.052 --> 01:07:37.920
Know what my kid did the other day?
Crossed Northern Boulevard all by himself.

01:07:38.022 --> 01:07:40.718
- Yeah?
- Shows the kid has nerve.

01:07:40.825 --> 01:07:43.157
My wife was sore for a few minutes.

01:07:43.261 --> 01:07:45.991
Big deal.
We haven't got any kid...

01:07:46.097 --> 01:07:48.930
and my wife's sore all the time.

01:07:53.037 --> 01:07:54.937
Which one of you is Garzah?

01:07:55.039 --> 01:07:57.872
- Garzah! Hey, Eddie!
- What?

01:08:02.113 --> 01:08:04.604
Your wife just told us
where we could find you.

01:08:04.716 --> 01:08:06.616
We're lookin' for your brother Willie.

01:08:06.718 --> 01:08:09.619
Me and my brother Willie ain't got
nothin' to do with each other.

01:08:09.721 --> 01:08:12.622
- He's no good.
- When'd you see him last?

01:08:12.724 --> 01:08:14.885
Oh, three months ago about.

01:08:14.992 --> 01:08:17.517
He tried to sell me
a diamond ring for my wife.

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:20.323
- I told him to go blow.
- Any idea where he lives?

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:23.423
He had a room somewhere around
the Williamsburg Bridge, is all I know.

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:25.434
- Got a picture of him?
- No.

01:08:25.536 --> 01:08:28.265
But when he was wrestlin', the newspapers
printed his mug a few times.

01:08:28.372 --> 01:08:30.363
That's it. Okay.

01:08:30.475 --> 01:08:33.774
Hey, if you send him up,
do me a favor, will ya?

01:08:33.877 --> 01:08:35.845
Throw the keys away.

01:08:41.085 --> 01:08:42.984
This is New York's East Side.

01:08:43.087 --> 01:08:47.319
And a former wrestler named Willie Garzah
lives somewhere around here.

01:08:47.425 --> 01:08:49.950
The Homicide Squad wants to talk to him...

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:51.961
if they can find him.

01:08:56.901 --> 01:09:01.337
Nothing to it, boys. Just spot this guy
out of half a million people.

01:09:03.541 --> 01:09:06.442
Lady, ever see a man, looks like this?

01:09:08.246 --> 01:09:11.374
Mister, ever see a man, looks like this?

01:09:13.684 --> 01:09:16.243
Lady, ever see a man, looks like this?

01:09:18.823 --> 01:09:20.881
You go home. You go to bed.

01:09:20.992 --> 01:09:23.654
You get up. You start all over.

01:09:23.761 --> 01:09:26.627
Mister, ever see a man, looks like this?

01:09:28.633 --> 01:09:31.727
Mister, ever see a man, looks like this?

01:09:33.504 --> 01:09:35.938
Hello, Dan. Jimmy.

01:09:36.974 --> 01:09:39.703
No. No, nothing so far.

01:09:39.810 --> 01:09:42.746
Oh, sure, sure.
I'll keep goin'. Yeah.

01:09:42.846 --> 01:09:44.747
What's doing at your end?

01:09:44.849 --> 01:09:48.410
Doin' fine here.
Mm-hmm.

01:09:48.519 --> 01:09:52.319
I'm talking to that clean-cut,
young American beauty again.

01:09:52.423 --> 01:09:56.018
Yeah. I think he's going to tell us
something this morning.

01:09:56.127 --> 01:09:58.027
Okay. Report in.

01:09:58.129 --> 01:10:00.029
I've told you everything I know.

01:10:00.131 --> 01:10:02.031
Oh, no, you haven't, sonny.

01:10:02.133 --> 01:10:04.101
But you will.

01:10:07.905 --> 01:10:09.873
Come in, Mr. McCormick.

01:10:11.542 --> 01:10:13.874
- You recognize this man?
- I certainly do.

01:10:15.146 --> 01:10:17.046
Stop that.

01:10:17.148 --> 01:10:19.048
Sit down.

01:10:19.150 --> 01:10:22.119
Any more of that and you'll
get yourself in trouble.

01:10:24.589 --> 01:10:27.786
You're gettin' quite a slappin' around
these days, aren't you?

01:10:27.892 --> 01:10:30.622
I came all the way down from Boston
to do that.

01:10:30.728 --> 01:10:34.129
That smooth-talking crook came to me
with an introduction I had to honor.

01:10:34.232 --> 01:10:36.291
He gave me a song and dance.

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.868
His sisterwas terribly ill,
needed an operation.

01:10:38.970 --> 01:10:42.906
He was trying to sell her jewels.
I paid him over $3,000.

01:10:43.007 --> 01:10:44.941
Now it turns out to be stolen property.

01:10:45.042 --> 01:10:47.010
You paying him to say that, Muldoon?

01:10:50.314 --> 01:10:52.942
You still can't prove anything.

01:10:53.050 --> 01:10:54.950
I can.

01:10:55.052 --> 01:10:57.145
I run my business with great care.

01:10:57.255 --> 01:10:59.849
This is the letter of introduction
he brought with him.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.460
Dr. Lawrence Stoneman.

01:11:04.562 --> 01:11:06.894
Dr. Stoneman treated my mother
some years ago.

01:11:06.998 --> 01:11:08.898
I had to honor his letter.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.400
Will you wait outside, Mr. McCormick?

01:11:13.704 --> 01:11:17.231
How do you get a letter of introduction
from a man like Stoneman?

01:11:18.743 --> 01:11:20.802
You're goin' to the penitentiary, Niles...

01:11:20.912 --> 01:11:24.814
but from now on, the length of your sentence
depends on you.

01:11:24.916 --> 01:11:28.010
Stealin' jewelry is one thing.
Murder is different.

01:11:28.119 --> 01:11:31.384
You know I didn't kill her.
I was at the Trinidad Club. I have witnesses.

01:11:31.489 --> 01:11:33.787
- Then who did kill her?
- I don't know.

01:11:33.891 --> 01:11:36.052
- Who's Henderson?
- I don't know.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.924
Listen, young fella.
The picnic is over.

01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:41.191
No, you've told your last lie.

01:11:41.299 --> 01:11:45.861
You're knee-deep in stolen jewelry.
You're involved in the Dexter murder.

01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:49.667
You've been tryin' to obstruct justice
all along the line.

01:11:59.417 --> 01:12:02.250
Now you're goin' to tell me
what I want to know...

01:12:02.353 --> 01:12:06.221
or if it's the last thing I do
in this department...

01:12:06.324 --> 01:12:10.021
I'll get you 20 years.

01:12:11.896 --> 01:12:15.593
Now, that's the truth, sonny boy.
And you know I'm not bluffin'.

01:12:18.269 --> 01:12:20.237
Who's Henderson?

01:12:21.372 --> 01:12:23.340
Who's Henderson?

01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:26.677
Stoneman.

01:12:27.712 --> 01:12:29.680
It's Dr. Stoneman.

01:12:41.258 --> 01:12:43.954
- Got any cold root beer?
- Like ice.

01:12:53.771 --> 01:12:56.035
Ever see this man?

01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:58.608
- He's a box fighter?
- Wrestler.

01:12:58.709 --> 01:13:00.870
Wrestler, boxing - what do I know?

01:13:00.978 --> 01:13:03.947
Five cents, please.
Uh, please.

01:13:06.617 --> 01:13:11.281
He's a fella who likes
to play the, uh, whatchamacallit.

01:13:11.389 --> 01:13:13.550
The harmonica. Yes.

01:13:13.658 --> 01:13:17.059
- Sure, I know him. Willie.
- Where does he live?

01:13:17.161 --> 01:13:19.891
- This street someplace.
- What house?

01:13:19.997 --> 01:13:23.990
- Down the street someplace. I don't know.
- Where's the phone?

01:13:24.101 --> 01:13:28.299
Mister -Who-Who are you, mister?

01:13:29.907 --> 01:13:33.434
You-You from a collection agency maybe?

01:13:36.947 --> 01:13:39.916
Ben? This is Jimmy.
Dan there?

01:13:40.017 --> 01:13:41.917
Oh. Well, now look.

01:13:42.019 --> 01:13:45.113
When he gets back,
tell him I've located Garzah.

01:13:45.222 --> 01:13:49.591
Yeah. On Norfolk Street,
between Rivington and Houston.

01:13:49.694 --> 01:13:52.857
Right. Okay. Bye.

01:13:53.898 --> 01:13:57.459
By me, Willie is a nice fella.
A man likes kids, he's nice.

01:13:57.568 --> 01:14:01.163
Any little kid asks him,
Willie plays the, uh, whatchamacallit.

01:14:01.272 --> 01:14:03.706
I don't want I should make trouble for him.

01:14:03.808 --> 01:14:05.708
Don't worry, lady.

01:14:07.044 --> 01:14:09.604
Mister, you don't want your root beer?

01:14:26.697 --> 01:14:28.665
Lieutenant Muldoon, police department.

01:14:28.766 --> 01:14:32.258
- Is Dr. Stoneman in?
- He's in the X-ray room.

01:14:32.369 --> 01:14:35.827
- Where's his office?
- Straight ahead.

01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:38.431
I want you to do
exactly as I tell you, miss.

01:14:38.542 --> 01:14:41.340
Tell the patients who are waiting
that they have to leave.

01:14:41.445 --> 01:14:43.345
- But -
- Do as I say, miss.

01:14:52.256 --> 01:14:55.521
You kids know a man who lives around here,
the name of Willie Garzah?

01:14:55.626 --> 01:14:57.253
- No.
- I don't know him.

01:14:57.361 --> 01:14:59.261
- Plays the harmonica.
- I know him.

01:14:59.363 --> 01:15:01.263
- Willie.
- Where's he live?

01:15:01.365 --> 01:15:04.391
Across the street.
The corner house, I think. Or the next one.

01:15:04.502 --> 01:15:06.436
Good girl.

01:15:07.471 --> 01:15:09.371
Superman!

01:15:19.517 --> 01:15:21.485
Here. Sit there.

01:15:24.088 --> 01:15:26.522
And don't say anything.

01:15:26.624 --> 01:15:30.025
- This is really unheard of.
- Yes, I know, ma'am.

01:15:30.127 --> 01:15:34.063
Now, tell Dr. Stoneman
someone out here has to see him.

01:15:34.165 --> 01:15:37.100
Tell him to leave his patient
and come right out.

01:15:37.201 --> 01:15:39.169
And don't tell him anything else.

01:15:41.405 --> 01:15:46.069
Uh, miss, use the, uh - this thing.

01:15:46.177 --> 01:15:48.145
I'll lose my job over this.

01:15:51.882 --> 01:15:55.579
Doctor, there's someone here.
He has to see you.

01:15:55.686 --> 01:15:57.779
You have to come out right now.

01:15:57.888 --> 01:16:00.652
You must, Doctor.
Right now. You must.

01:16:07.364 --> 01:16:09.389
What are you doing here?

01:16:13.103 --> 01:16:15.003
Who are you?

01:16:15.105 --> 01:16:18.165
Lieutenant Muldoon
of the Homicide Squad.

01:16:19.376 --> 01:16:21.901
Do you go under the name of Henderson?

01:16:22.947 --> 01:16:24.505
Yes.

01:16:26.617 --> 01:16:29.609
You've been a long time getting here.

01:16:31.121 --> 01:16:33.021
Almost a week.

01:16:33.123 --> 01:16:35.455
You're under arrest
for the murder ofJean Dexter.

01:16:35.559 --> 01:16:39.017
No. I couldn't do anything like that.

01:16:39.129 --> 01:16:41.029
If anyone did it, it was he.

01:16:41.131 --> 01:16:44.066
Finished.
I'm finished now.

01:16:44.168 --> 01:16:46.432
What's your relationship
to Niles and Dexter?

01:16:50.474 --> 01:16:52.601
A lambled to slaughter.

01:16:53.911 --> 01:16:57.142
An idiot...
robbed of self-respect.

01:16:57.248 --> 01:17:00.217
I saw her a year ago in that dress shop...

01:17:00.317 --> 01:17:04.219
and from then on,
I was drunk with her, lost.

01:17:04.321 --> 01:17:07.654
For six months now,
I've known they've been using me.

01:17:08.759 --> 01:17:11.057
I was their tipster.

01:17:11.161 --> 01:17:13.061
Me. Stoneman.

01:17:13.163 --> 01:17:16.257
- What do you mean?
- They used my social connections.

01:17:16.367 --> 01:17:18.301
My wife -

01:17:19.703 --> 01:17:23.537
My wife is a party giver. Jean would
find out from me who was going to be there.

01:17:24.642 --> 01:17:27.543
It was only aftermonths that I realized
when anyone came to my house...

01:17:27.645 --> 01:17:29.545
his apartment was robbed the same night.

01:17:29.647 --> 01:17:31.547
Why didn't you go to the police?

01:17:31.649 --> 01:17:34.243
Why doesn't a drug addict
stop taking drugs?

01:17:34.351 --> 01:17:36.478
She kept promising each time was the last.

01:17:37.588 --> 01:17:41.718
I believed her
because I was afraid to go to the police.

01:17:43.827 --> 01:17:46.318
I was afraid of the scandal.

01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:48.694
Did you arrange the burglary
of your own apartment?

01:17:48.799 --> 01:17:54.499
Yes. I even came to that.
I was frightened.

01:17:54.605 --> 01:17:57.005
I had to wallow in my own filth.

01:17:57.107 --> 01:18:00.201
What proof have you
that you didn't kill Dexter?

01:18:00.311 --> 01:18:04.179
Proof? I was someplace else.

01:18:04.281 --> 01:18:07.011
Miss Owen, my date book.

01:18:07.117 --> 01:18:09.415
Um, uh, yes.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:13.047
A birthday party, uh, at the Broughtons'.

01:18:13.157 --> 01:18:17.457
Will you testify in court that Niles and Dexter
committed these burglaries?

01:18:17.561 --> 01:18:22.021
No. No, they were the fixers,
the smart ones.

01:18:23.067 --> 01:18:26.867
They used me one way. They hired other men
to do the actual robberies.

01:18:26.971 --> 01:18:29.201
- Who?
- I don't know.

01:18:30.941 --> 01:18:35.105
Miss Owen.
My practice.

01:18:35.212 --> 01:18:38.079
No, don't cry.

01:18:39.183 --> 01:18:41.549
You will call Dr. Grenard.

01:18:43.654 --> 01:18:45.554
Only don't let me have to see anyone.

01:18:45.656 --> 01:18:48.955
Not my wife, no friends, no lawyer.
Just lock me up and hide me away.

01:18:51.628 --> 01:18:54.722
Me. Stoneman.

01:18:56.667 --> 01:18:58.635
It's impossible.

01:19:01.405 --> 01:19:03.373
I won't have it.

01:19:07.277 --> 01:19:09.472
Stop! Stop! Let me go!

01:19:14.118 --> 01:19:16.086
I don't know much
about medicine, Doctor...

01:19:16.186 --> 01:19:20.646
but I'm pretty sure that's one prescription
that never cured anything.

01:19:26.397 --> 01:19:28.297
Thanks, Niles.

01:19:28.399 --> 01:19:30.367
And now that you've finally
decided to cooperate...

01:19:30.467 --> 01:19:32.367
why not go the whole way?

01:19:32.469 --> 01:19:34.369
You're not stupid.

01:19:35.406 --> 01:19:37.840
You're hooked and you know it.

01:19:37.941 --> 01:19:39.909
So why not spill the rest?

01:19:42.112 --> 01:19:44.012
Who did the job for you?

01:19:44.114 --> 01:19:47.049
Who was it?
Who was it?

01:19:48.919 --> 01:19:50.819
Willie Garzah.

01:19:50.921 --> 01:19:52.821
He and Backalis.

01:19:52.923 --> 01:19:55.414
Theywanted more of a cut
from the robberies.

01:19:55.526 --> 01:19:58.586
Garzah killed Jean, and later that night
he killed Backalis.

01:20:01.131 --> 01:20:04.191
I loved Jean.
I had nothing to do with it.

01:20:04.301 --> 01:20:06.201
It was Garzah.

01:20:06.303 --> 01:20:08.203
Garzah. Garzah.

01:20:25.789 --> 01:20:27.757
Come on in.

01:20:29.059 --> 01:20:33.496
Oh. I thought it was the janitor for the rent.
Who are you?

01:20:34.598 --> 01:20:37.226
Don't mind me.
I'm just havin' a little workout.

01:20:37.334 --> 01:20:41.031
My name's Hawkey. I work up at Bellevue Hospital.
Are you Willie Garzah?

01:20:41.138 --> 01:20:45.165
That's me. Ever seen me wrestle?
I wasn't so bad.

01:20:45.275 --> 01:20:47.243
No, I never did.

01:20:47.344 --> 01:20:50.609
Patient up at the hospital gave me your address.
Asked me to see you.

01:20:50.714 --> 01:20:54.445
- Yeah? Who?
- Backalis his name is.

01:20:54.551 --> 01:20:56.542
- Pete?
- Yeah.

01:20:57.654 --> 01:21:00.020
What's he doin' in the hospital?

01:21:00.124 --> 01:21:03.218
Almost got drowned.
Fell in the river when he was plastered.

01:21:03.327 --> 01:21:05.295
Some guy in a tugboat fished him out.

01:21:05.395 --> 01:21:09.126
You don't say.
Oh, that Pete.

01:21:09.233 --> 01:21:11.565
Can't leave the booze alone.

01:21:11.668 --> 01:21:13.568
So, what does he want from me?

01:21:13.670 --> 01:21:15.968
He says he wants to see you.

01:21:16.073 --> 01:21:18.439
You know what he wants?

01:21:20.144 --> 01:21:22.112
He wants money.

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.841
Some condition I'm in, eh, brother?

01:21:28.952 --> 01:21:32.649
Don't smoke. Don't drink.

01:21:34.591 --> 01:21:38.459
So Pete wants money again, eh?

01:21:42.399 --> 01:21:44.367
Ah, that Pete.

01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:49.131
You know what you can tell him, buddy?

01:21:53.944 --> 01:21:57.607
Lie still or I'll snap your arm
like a wishbone.

01:22:07.758 --> 01:22:09.726
Get up.

01:22:11.228 --> 01:22:14.026
- Copper, ain't you?
- Yeah.

01:22:15.065 --> 01:22:19.365
Just because I was a wrestler,
everybody thinks I'm dumb.

01:22:19.469 --> 01:22:21.801
I'm not dumb.
I'm smart.

01:22:21.905 --> 01:22:24.169
Now how did I know you were a copper?

01:22:24.274 --> 01:22:29.143
Because nobody knows where I live,
not even Pete Backalis.

01:22:30.781 --> 01:22:33.272
If you're smart, you'll come down
to headquarters with me.

01:22:33.383 --> 01:22:36.875
Ha, ha.
That wouldn't be smart.

01:22:36.987 --> 01:22:40.980
You know why?
Because Backalis ain't in Bellevue.

01:22:41.091 --> 01:22:44.185
He's in the morgue.
Turn around.

01:22:44.294 --> 01:22:46.660
Turn around.

01:22:48.398 --> 01:22:50.298
Don't be a fool.

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:53.096
I'll prove I'm smart, copper.
And you know how?

01:22:53.203 --> 01:22:56.798
You're scared right now I'm gonna
rub you out, but I ain't, 'cause I'm smart.

01:22:56.907 --> 01:23:00.434
Rub out a cop
and you'll really get the chair.

01:23:00.544 --> 01:23:04.776
All I need to do is put you to sleep.
Then I'm off.

01:23:04.881 --> 01:23:06.781
Try and find me.

01:23:06.883 --> 01:23:10.842
This is a great big, beautiful city.

01:23:10.954 --> 01:23:13.081
Just try and find me.

01:23:16.793 --> 01:23:19.387
That was a rabbit punch, copper.

01:23:19.496 --> 01:23:21.464
And it's strictly illegal.

01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:25.731
Yeah. He signed it.

01:23:25.836 --> 01:23:27.667
Wait a minute, Ben.
Perelli.

01:23:27.771 --> 01:23:30.137
- Yes, sir?
- Keep Niles away from the newspapermen.

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:32.470
- Yes, sir.
- Now listen, Ben.

01:23:32.576 --> 01:23:35.875
When Halloran calls in -
or Fowler or Constantino -

01:23:35.979 --> 01:23:40.575
tell them that Willie Garzah
may be the gimmick in this case.

01:23:40.684 --> 01:23:42.914
When did Halloran call in?

01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:44.988
Was he alone?

01:23:45.088 --> 01:23:47.454
Now get this.
Send out an emergency.

01:23:47.557 --> 01:23:49.821
Rush every available squad car.

01:23:49.926 --> 01:23:51.826
Block off the street.
Surround it.

01:23:58.635 --> 01:24:01.468
Boundary line, 57th Precinct to signal 32.

01:24:01.571 --> 01:24:04.233
The address, Rivington Street,
between Essex and Norfolk.

01:24:04.341 --> 01:24:08.641
Car 702, Fifth Precinct,
509, Seventh Precinct and 110 will respond.

01:24:08.745 --> 01:24:11.908
Use caution.
Emergency service truck responding.

01:24:12.015 --> 01:24:15.473
Attention all cars. Particular attention,
cars in Lower Manhattan.

01:24:15.585 --> 01:24:19.749
I n connection with the signal 32, block off
and surround both sides of the street.

01:24:19.856 --> 01:24:21.790
Be on the lookout for two men.

01:24:21.892 --> 01:24:24.588
One, Detective James Halloran,
26 years old.

01:24:24.695 --> 01:24:28.688
Two, William Garzah, wanted in connection
with a homicide in the 20th Precinct.

01:24:28.799 --> 01:24:30.767
Proceed cautiously.
Garzah may be armed.

01:26:31.121 --> 01:26:33.589
You've lost him, Halloran, haven't you?

01:26:33.690 --> 01:26:35.749
Well, he's a tough cookie.

01:26:35.859 --> 01:26:38.692
You better follow routine now.
Report in.

01:27:24.541 --> 01:27:27.374
The cops are on a manhunt, Garzah.

01:27:27.477 --> 01:27:31.243
You need a plan.
You've got to get out ofthis neighborhood.

01:27:31.348 --> 01:27:34.784
Stop and look at a tie.
Maybe you're being shadowed.

01:27:38.455 --> 01:27:41.686
Lady, ever see a man, looks like this?

01:27:44.227 --> 01:27:46.491
You gotta get out
of this neighborhood, Garzah.

01:27:48.465 --> 01:27:52.094
That's it. A crowded bus
is safer for you than a taxi.

01:27:55.772 --> 01:27:58.468
Tough luck.
But you can't wait for the next one.

01:27:58.575 --> 01:28:00.509
How about the subway?

01:28:26.069 --> 01:28:28.799
Wait a minute, fella.
I'll tell you when.

01:28:29.839 --> 01:28:31.739
Okay.

01:28:40.784 --> 01:28:42.684
Take it easy, Garzah.

01:28:42.786 --> 01:28:45.584
Don't run.
Don't call attention to yourself.

01:28:52.596 --> 01:28:55.030
- Dan, Garzah's the guy.
- I know. I know. Where is he?

01:28:55.131 --> 01:28:57.998
I don't know. I lost him.
But he's around here someplace.

01:29:02.706 --> 01:29:04.970
It's only an accident, Garzah. Pass it off.

01:29:07.444 --> 01:29:09.776
Don't lose your head.
Don't losey our head!

01:29:10.847 --> 01:29:13.782
Now remember, boys,
we're in a crowded neighborhood.

01:29:13.883 --> 01:29:16.477
Now here's what we do -

01:29:44.781 --> 01:29:46.305
It's Garzah!

01:29:47.851 --> 01:29:51.651
Dan, it's Garzah! Halloran's after him!
They're running towards the Brooklyn end.

01:29:51.755 --> 01:29:54.019
You stay with Halloran!
Don't shoot unless you have to!

01:29:54.124 --> 01:29:56.092
You two stay with him.

01:30:06.403 --> 01:30:09.236
Get radio. Have them
send a car from the Brooklyn end.

01:30:11.174 --> 01:30:14.109
You boys, get in.
You two, cover this end.

01:30:37.567 --> 01:30:40.661
That tower up ahead on the left -
you boys will get out there.

01:30:40.770 --> 01:30:42.795
- Watch for Garzah from that angle.
- Right.

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:46.166
Hold it! Hold it, boys!

01:31:46.269 --> 01:31:49.102
Come on down.
We want no dead heroes.

01:31:49.205 --> 01:31:52.003
There's no place he can go to now.

01:32:00.650 --> 01:32:03.312
Garzah, come on down!

01:32:04.687 --> 01:32:07.053
You've got a chance
if you come down now!

01:32:08.091 --> 01:32:10.025
I'm tellin' my men not to shoot!

01:33:15.091 --> 01:33:19.926
All right, Garzah,
we give you 100% in acrobatics!

01:33:20.029 --> 01:33:23.294
Now will you come down under your own power,
or do you want a little persuasion?

01:33:23.399 --> 01:33:25.162
What do you say, Garzah?

01:33:39.349 --> 01:33:41.874
It's 1:00 in the morning again.

01:33:41.985 --> 01:33:43.885
And this is the city.

01:33:45.054 --> 01:33:47.386
And these are the lights...

01:33:47.490 --> 01:33:51.722
that a child, born to the name of Batory,
hungered for.

01:33:51.828 --> 01:33:53.728
Her passion has been played out now.

01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:56.890
Her name, her face, her history...

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.901
were worth five cents a day
for six days.

01:34:00.003 --> 01:34:03.495
Tomorrow a new case
will hit the headlines.

01:34:03.606 --> 01:34:06.734
Yet some will remember Jean Dexter.

01:34:06.843 --> 01:34:09.505
She won't be entirely forgotten.

01:34:11.414 --> 01:34:13.905
Not entirely.

01:34:14.984 --> 01:34:16.952
Not altogether.

01:34:24.227 --> 01:34:29.062
There are eight million stories
in the naked city.

01:34:29.165 --> 01:34:32.225
This has been one ofthem.
