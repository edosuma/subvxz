WEBVTT

00:19.833 --> 00:22.500
I'll be back! I'm free!

01:20.733 --> 01:22.433
No, thank you.

02:00.200 --> 02:04.833
Mark, I'm trying to study.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.833
How did you know that was me?

02:12.133 --> 02:15.166
I admit my stalker technique
needs little work, but..

02:15.233 --> 02:17.500
...you couldn't
possibly have heard me.

02:17.566 --> 02:19.066
I mean, not with all
the racket downstairs

02:19.133 --> 02:20.366
and those headphones.

02:20.433 --> 02:21.400
I didn't even turn 'em on yet

02:21.466 --> 02:22.933
not that they would have
done any good.

02:23.433 --> 02:24.833
Okay, so..

02:26.300 --> 02:27.800
...you knew some maniac
crawled in the window.

02:27.866 --> 02:30.100
How could you be
absolutely sure that was me?

02:30.166 --> 02:32.600
Because any maniac that clumsy
I figure I could handle

02:32.666 --> 02:34.166
no offence.

02:34.233 --> 02:36.766
I don't know
why I even bother to try.

02:36.833 --> 02:38.100
You're not afraid of anything.

02:38.166 --> 02:39.633
Mark, I'm afraid
that I'm not gonna pass

02:39.700 --> 02:41.233
this anatomy test tomorrow.

02:41.300 --> 02:42.866
What you need is a little R&amp;R.

02:42.933 --> 02:44.400
So I'm going to drag your

02:44.466 --> 02:47.833
anatomy and your Mozart.

02:47.900 --> 02:49.933
We're goin' downstairs
and party.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.166
Mark, I'm not going.

02:51.233 --> 02:53.333
- 'Course you are.
- No, I'm not.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.000
You don't wanna disappoint,
Mr. Pumpkin.

02:56.666 --> 03:00.133
Marsha, come on.
This is Halloween.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.633
It's a very important holiday.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.900
- Not in Detroit.
- This isn't Detroit.

03:04.966 --> 03:07.533
- This is Springwood.
- Mark, and this is goodbye.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.133
Would you come
downstairs to the party?

03:09.200 --> 03:11.900
You might surprise yourself
and have a good time.

03:11.966 --> 03:14.233
Mark, this is
my most important test.

03:14.300 --> 03:15.333
It's my anatomy exam

03:15.400 --> 03:18.500
and I don't wanna blow
my entire GPA with a C.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.900
I'll be happy just passing.

03:20.966 --> 03:23.466
Passing's not
good enough for me.

03:23.533 --> 03:25.500
And you know that.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.533
Not good enough for grandma.

03:56.966 --> 03:58.300
I don't wanna talk
about her anymore.

03:58.366 --> 04:00.266
Uh, hey, me neither.

04:00.333 --> 04:02.533
Gary, I'm sorry. I thought
you were somebody else.

04:03.466 --> 04:04.733
Oh, that's the point.

04:06.733 --> 04:08.433
Look, look, you're already
late for the party.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.133
So why don't you get upstairs
and get into your costume?

04:10.200 --> 04:12.200
Actually I wasn't coming in,
I was just leaving.

04:12.266 --> 04:13.966
Uh, library's closed.

04:14.033 --> 04:16.200
Dissection room
is open all night.

04:16.266 --> 04:19.100
You're passing us up
for a cadaver?

04:19.166 --> 04:21.400
I'm sorry, Gary, I've got
an anatomy mid-term tomorrow--

04:21.466 --> 04:23.133
Now, now, that's,
that's two apologies

04:23.200 --> 04:24.366
in, in, less than a minute

04:24.433 --> 04:26.366
I'm impressed.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.100
- I'm sorry.
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

04:28.166 --> 04:30.966
I think that's a world record.

04:31.033 --> 04:34.466
Marsha, look, I admire your
dedication and your discipline

04:34.533 --> 04:37.266
but you gotta
feed the machine, right?

04:37.333 --> 04:39.733
- Right.
- Right.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.133
When you dream
you see a picture, right?

04:42.200 --> 04:44.733
All the synapse in the brain
send electrical impulses

04:44.800 --> 04:47.100
broadcasting that picture
to every part of your body

04:47.166 --> 04:48.733
Zach's a real party animal.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.200
Now, what I wanna do is,
intercept those brain waves

04:52.133 --> 04:53.833
decode them, and then replicate

04:53.900 --> 04:55.266
the sensory information
on videotape.

04:55.333 --> 04:56.466
Come on, Zach,
tell us the truth

04:56.533 --> 04:57.933
you're just another
post graduate pervert

04:58.000 --> 04:59.433
using huge research grads

04:59.500 --> 05:01.500
to indulge your
voyeuristic fantasies.

05:01.566 --> 05:02.866
Money that
Professor Gutman gives me

05:02.933 --> 05:05.300
I couldn't rent
an X-rated cassette.

05:05.366 --> 05:06.733
Not that I would.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.633
Yeah, but your not saying
that you wouldn't.

05:08.700 --> 05:10.000
No, no, I-I admit.

05:10.066 --> 05:12.166
I, I like watching people.

05:12.233 --> 05:13.400
Women.

05:13.466 --> 05:14.566
Naked.

05:14.633 --> 05:16.166
Stripped bare.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.033
You know, naked, a woman
can't hide anything.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.433
She can't keep anything secret.

05:20.500 --> 05:24.166
She can't even lie,
her body gives away every time.

05:24.233 --> 05:26.966
Given the proper stimuli, she's
got absolutely no control o--

05:27.033 --> 05:28.966
Excuse me, um,
Gary, I've gotta go.

05:29.033 --> 05:30.500
- So thanks.
- Okay.

05:36.300 --> 05:38.200
For some women,
it's a very scary thing.

06:00.900 --> 06:01.933
Hey, Ernie.

06:05.033 --> 06:06.333
Are you okay?

06:06.400 --> 06:08.133
Oh, it's nothing.
Y-you just surprised me.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.333
Surprised you?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.366
Ernie, you've seen med students
coming and going

06:11.433 --> 06:12.433
all day and night around here.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.500
Yeah, I know but, uh

06:14.566 --> 06:16.900
tonight is Halloween.

06:17.733 --> 06:20.166
- Et tu,&lt;
- Huh?

06:20.233 --> 06:23.100
Nothing.
It's Latin for I give up.

06:23.166 --> 06:24.100
Well, I can't help it.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.266
Look, you've been here, uh

06:25.333 --> 06:26.466
every night this week.

06:26.533 --> 06:28.100
Tonight, you oughta be
with people

06:28.166 --> 06:29.333
instead of with corpses.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.333
Not corpses.
Cadavers.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.266
Yeah, well, you can call 'em
any fancy words you want

06:33.333 --> 06:34.466
they're still just as creepy

06:34.533 --> 06:35.666
especially on Halloween.

06:35.733 --> 06:37.200
This town really takes this

06:37.266 --> 06:39.833
trick or treating stuff
seriously, don't they?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.366
Yes, we do.

06:41.433 --> 06:44.633
That's because we got a very
spooky ghost in Springwood.

06:44.700 --> 06:47.566
Ooh, are you telling me that
this town is haunted now?

06:47.633 --> 06:49.433
Yes, by Freddy Krueger.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.266
- Freddy, who?
- Krueger.

06:51.333 --> 06:53.433
He murdered innocent children.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.666
He burned for it.

06:54.733 --> 06:56.700
The parents they, uh,
torched him

06:56.766 --> 06:58.766
a few blocks from here.

06:58.833 --> 07:03.133
Well, creeps like that only
scare me when they're alive.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.200
Yes, uh, maybe
you're a little too educated

07:05.266 --> 07:07.200
to believe in ghosts.

07:08.433 --> 07:11.033
Okay, uh, say that
this ghost--

07:11.100 --> 07:13.266
Freddy Krueger!

07:13.333 --> 07:14.700
Excuse me, Freddy Krueger

07:14.766 --> 07:16.433
really does exist.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.366
He can't really do anythin
except bounce under a shee

07:18.433 --> 07:19.900
now can he?

07:21.733 --> 07:24.033
Anyway, dead or alive a guy's
gotta do a little bit more

07:24.100 --> 07:26.233
than say boo
to get my attention.

07:28.566 --> 07:29.900
Oh, God.

08:08.666 --> 08:11.266
I'm not gonna play
games with you.

08:11.333 --> 08:13.066
You're not my first cadaver.

08:13.133 --> 08:16.000
That doesn't mean
you're not special.

08:16.066 --> 08:17.833
You know they can take away
your head, your arms

08:17.900 --> 08:22.800
and everything else but to me
you'll be the same old..

08:22.866 --> 08:24.233
...Freddy.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.866
Ernie!

08:58.466 --> 09:01.566
Must have been something I said.

09:01.633 --> 09:03.000
Right?

09:18.533 --> 09:19.733
Go ahead.

09:32.966 --> 09:34.200
Ernie, I saw it.

09:34.266 --> 09:35.700
It was right here.

09:35.766 --> 09:38.333
Oh, look, honey, anyone ca
see you're a bit fried.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.333
Hell!

09:39.400 --> 09:41.166
Shut in with all these
dead folks

09:41.233 --> 09:43.633
uh, I guess I'd start
seeing things too.

09:43.700 --> 09:46.333
Hey, why don't you
knock off for tonight?

09:46.400 --> 09:48.866
No, I-I'm fine.
I'll be okay.

09:48.933 --> 09:50.200
Oh, look, uh, I'll tell you what

09:50.266 --> 09:53.100
I'll stick around a while
and keep you company.

09:53.166 --> 09:55.200
Sure your stomach can handle it?

09:55.266 --> 09:56.733
Oh, yeah, this, uh

09:56.800 --> 09:58.300
stuff doesn't scare me.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.700
Dead as dead.

10:15.966 --> 10:17.533
That is disgusting.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.900
Excuse me.

11:18.300 --> 11:20.800
'I'll teach you to touch
filthy boys.'

11:21.600 --> 11:24.500
'Vile, unclean.'

11:24.566 --> 11:26.433
I'm gonna help you get clean.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.000
Scrub you clean.

11:28.500 --> 11:29.800
No.

11:33.266 --> 11:35.800
There we go.

11:35.866 --> 11:37.333
I didn't do it.

11:52.900 --> 11:55.133
'You're not clean yet.'

11:56.033 --> 11:58.433
Oh-h-h.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.300
What big eyes you have.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.533
Come to granny.

12:06.033 --> 12:07.800
Oh, Mark.

12:11.466 --> 12:14.833
I must have
really got you that time.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.766
No, Mark. It wasn't you,
it was, I'm-I'm telling you--

12:16.833 --> 12:19.033
I know what it was. I mean
you're working too hard.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.733
You're studying
and you're thinking.

12:23.166 --> 12:25.200
What the hell did you do?

12:25.266 --> 12:27.800
Oh, I must have
got carried away.

12:31.533 --> 12:34.033
Well, you're gonna get carried
away if you don't let up.

12:35.233 --> 12:36.533
Let up?

12:37.500 --> 12:39.033
She never let up.

12:39.100 --> 12:41.700
She never let you live.

12:41.766 --> 12:43.633
Marsha, you can't keep living
in your grandmother's shadow.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.933
It'll suffocated you.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.033
Mark, what if I can't live
out of my grandmother's shadow?

12:49.100 --> 12:51.333
You're only a human being.
You gotta live with it.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.033
I mean, you have to eat
and sleep.

12:56.600 --> 12:57.900
Touch.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.100
Mark, I can't.

13:05.566 --> 13:07.733
I'm sorry, please understand
it's just that

13:07.800 --> 13:10.333
when I think
about her I...can't.

13:13.100 --> 13:14.533
Did you hear that?

13:14.600 --> 13:15.533
What?

13:19.566 --> 13:21.100
That.

13:21.166 --> 13:23.133
What, Mark?
I didn't hear anything.

13:25.066 --> 13:26.033
Wait here.

14:23.333 --> 14:26.100
'Marsha, you hurt my feelings.'

14:30.300 --> 14:33.033
Mark? Mark?

14:41.866 --> 14:43.800
Mark?

15:02.066 --> 15:03.533
Mark?

15:13.600 --> 15:15.533
What are you doin' here?

15:27.566 --> 15:28.800
Mark, what is
the matter with you?

15:28.866 --> 15:31.566
Oh, come on.
Just trying to cheer you up.

15:31.633 --> 15:33.433
It's a Halloween game.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.533
Would you get in
the spirit of things?

15:34.600 --> 15:37.366
It'll make you feel
a whole lot better.

15:37.433 --> 15:39.400
It's a Springwood tradition.

15:53.233 --> 15:55.933
Jump my bones, baby.

16:29.833 --> 16:31.066
Trick or treat?

16:31.133 --> 16:32.333
Mark..

16:32.400 --> 16:33.966
...why are you doing this?

16:34.033 --> 16:35.433
Doing what?

16:43.600 --> 16:45.800
That's it, Mark. I've flipped.

16:45.866 --> 16:47.566
I don't know if I'm not
getting enough sleep

16:47.633 --> 16:48.966
or I'm just cramming too much

16:49.033 --> 16:51.066
but whatever it is, I'm no
gonna do well in this..

16:51.133 --> 16:53.233
I think we both know what it is.

16:53.300 --> 16:55.233
It's a lack of fun.

16:55.300 --> 16:57.400
Of course, you're seeing things.

17:02.233 --> 17:03.633
It's Halloween.

17:06.966 --> 17:08.133
Come with me.
Have some fun.

17:08.866 --> 17:10.600
Come on.
Come on.

17:21.066 --> 17:23.966
What are we doing here?

17:24.033 --> 17:26.533
It's about time you starte
looking over your shoulder

17:26.600 --> 17:28.300
See what's chasing you.

17:33.033 --> 17:34.000
Come on.

17:57.133 --> 17:58.300
You see?

17:59.533 --> 18:02.000
You have to look.

18:02.066 --> 18:03.733
You have to face it.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.666
Did you hear somethin'?

18:21.733 --> 18:23.933
I'm telling you,
nothing is out there.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.066
I don't know.
What about my grandmother?

18:26.133 --> 18:28.366
You said she won't
be back for hours.

18:28.433 --> 18:29.733
I know.

18:31.333 --> 18:32.600
Sorry.

18:38.266 --> 18:40.100
Oh, filthy whore.

18:40.166 --> 18:42.100
We're never gonna get you clean.

18:46.533 --> 18:48.033
Excuse me, ma'am.

18:50.833 --> 18:53.600
I wasn't doing
anything wrong, grandma.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.500
Grandma?

18:55.566 --> 18:58.500
I never got to be a grandma.

18:58.566 --> 19:00.833
Grandma's get to spoil
their grandkids.

19:00.900 --> 19:03.300
But your selfish parents
had to go and die.

19:03.366 --> 19:05.466
I was left to raise
you and by God

19:05.533 --> 19:06.933
'I swore to do it right.'

19:07.000 --> 19:08.600
'I tried to teach
you what's proper'

19:08.666 --> 19:10.566
'but you just don't learn.'

19:10.633 --> 19:13.733
I told you time after time

19:13.800 --> 19:15.866
you've gotta fight the flesh.

19:15.933 --> 19:16.866
I'll help you.

19:16.933 --> 19:18.900
You're the one that's unclean!

19:18.966 --> 19:20.566
You're the one that's
not normal!

19:20.633 --> 19:22.733
I wasn't doing anything wrong
and I hate you!

19:22.800 --> 19:24.400
And I'm wishing you were dead!

19:24.466 --> 19:27.166
- Oh, you..
- Don't! Grandma!

19:27.233 --> 19:28.833
Grandma!

19:28.900 --> 19:30.833
Grandma, what's wrong?

19:30.900 --> 19:33.433
- Unclean.
- Grandma, what's the matter?

19:33.500 --> 19:35.600
'Grandma, what's the matter?'

19:35.666 --> 19:38.100
Grandma, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

19:38.166 --> 19:39.433
Don't die!

19:41.000 --> 19:42.866
Grandma, I'm sorry!

19:42.933 --> 19:44.200
Don't die!

19:44.266 --> 19:45.233
'Grandma, please.'

19:46.633 --> 19:49.400
Grandma, I didn't mean it.
I'm sorry.

19:50.900 --> 19:54.333
Grandma, please.
I'm sorry.

19:54.966 --> 19:56.866
No!

19:56.933 --> 19:59.733
No, grandma, I can help now.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.400
No, grandma, I can help.

20:06.833 --> 20:08.466
Grandma, I can help you now.

20:08.533 --> 20:10.100
I know what to do.

20:10.166 --> 20:11.933
Grandma, I learned it for you.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.333
Grandma!

20:15.400 --> 20:19.133
I'm sorry, it wasn't my fault.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.300
- I'm really sorry.
- You passed for me?

20:22.366 --> 20:24.533
There, there. Don't cry..

20:24.600 --> 20:25.800
...little whore.

20:32.333 --> 20:34.433
Trick or treat!

20:36.800 --> 20:38.633
How's that for a facelift?

20:42.666 --> 20:45.800
You should always
respect your elders.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.133
I didn't do it.
I didn't kill her!

20:49.200 --> 20:50.666
It wasn't my fault!

20:50.733 --> 20:52.700
Please leave me alone.

20:56.900 --> 21:00.033
I didn't kill her, Mark.
It wasn't my fault.

21:00.100 --> 21:02.133
You believe me,
don't you, Mark?

21:02.200 --> 21:03.133
'Course.

21:04.300 --> 21:06.866
I always knew the real story.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.800
You always understand,
don't you, Mark?

21:09.866 --> 21:11.800
You're always there for me

21:13.700 --> 21:15.633
You don't need me anymore.

21:16.933 --> 21:18.400
You faced it.

21:19.866 --> 21:22.766
I need you, Mark.

21:22.833 --> 21:24.300
Mark?

21:24.900 --> 21:26.600
Mark?

21:27.900 --> 21:29.833
I don't wanna be alone.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.533
Mar..

21:36.600 --> 21:39.600
Mark is such a sweet son.

21:55.766 --> 21:57.433
Mark.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.833
Please don't leave me
alone now, Mark.

21:59.900 --> 22:01.933
I'm not ready to be alone now.

22:02.833 --> 22:04.500
Mark, please.

22:04.566 --> 22:06.700
Please don't leave me alone now.

22:07.766 --> 22:09.600
Hey, it's Marsha.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.833
Mark, please don't
leave me alone now.

22:15.133 --> 22:17.366
What is it?

22:17.433 --> 22:19.833
- Are you alright?
- It's gonna be okay.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.433
- Are you okay, Marsha?
- 'I don't know.'

22:21.500 --> 22:23.733
'Please don't leave me
alone now, Mark.'

22:26.766 --> 22:28.033
Calm down, Marsha.

22:28.100 --> 22:29.700
W-w-who's Mark?

22:29.766 --> 22:31.933
- Don't you get it?
- No, get what?

22:32.933 --> 22:34.900
...th-there never was any Mark.

22:34.966 --> 22:36.233
He's just a part of her mind.

22:36.300 --> 22:39.466
God, I could build an entire
career on a head case like her.

22:39.533 --> 22:41.500
A head case like her?

23:02.433 --> 23:05.633
Alas, poor Masha.

23:16.933 --> 23:18.566
Crushed..

23:18.633 --> 23:20.600
...by love.

25:51.966 --> 25:54.333
Two months ago she was
a med school dropout.

25:54.400 --> 25:57.600
Too scared to sleep.

25:57.666 --> 25:59.200
'Grandmas coming back
from the dead.'

25:59.266 --> 26:02.233
'Boyfriends who never existed.'

26:02.300 --> 26:05.000
- 'We got her now.'

26:06.600 --> 26:07.866
This is her dream?

26:07.933 --> 26:10.000
Yeah.

26:10.066 --> 26:12.100
How'd you put her under?

26:12.166 --> 26:13.266
Hard work.

26:13.333 --> 26:15.633
Little hypnotherapy,
plus she trusts me.

26:17.033 --> 26:19.266
If anybody sees
this tape, it's your ass.

26:19.333 --> 26:21.133
'Nobody's gonna see it.'

26:21.200 --> 26:24.800
'Not until I get a perfect image
of one of her dreams on tape.'

26:24.866 --> 26:28.266
She's gonna sue you, pal,
for everything that you've got.

26:28.333 --> 26:30.500
She came in here as a patient,
not as a research subject.

26:30.566 --> 26:32.200
To find her release.

26:32.266 --> 26:34.233
Unconditionally.

26:44.266 --> 26:46.866
'Amazing, isn't she?'

26:46.933 --> 26:48.266
'All that repressed
sexual energy'

26:48.333 --> 26:51.266
'bottled up all those years?'

26:51.333 --> 26:53.200
'Waitin' for
a volcano to explode.'

27:04.766 --> 27:06.166
Wake her up.

27:06.233 --> 27:08.200
That's all we're gonna get

27:09.933 --> 27:12.366
Glitch must be somewhere between
the computer and the VCR.

27:12.433 --> 27:14.566
The glitch isn't in the
computer, it's in her.

27:14.633 --> 27:18.733
She's afraid of the dream,
she keeps holding back.

27:18.800 --> 27:22.033
Damn, I was sure we were gonna
get a clearer image this time.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.033
Getting nowhere.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.700
Signal hitting those electrodes
just isn't strong enough.

27:27.766 --> 27:29.100
She's got to give us more.

27:29.166 --> 27:30.966
Not a hell of a lot
to do about that.

27:31.033 --> 27:32.766
You can't just shove
a floppy disk in her mouth

27:32.833 --> 27:33.800
and reprogram her dreams.

27:33.866 --> 27:35.500
I'm not looking
to reprogram them.

27:35.566 --> 27:38.000
I want to enhance them.

27:38.066 --> 27:40.033
We got to see more.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.433
I love screamers.

28:46.366 --> 28:48.300
Looks like you
got what you wanted.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.600
Come on, Marsha,
wake up. Wake, wake up.

29:01.300 --> 29:03.233
You alright?

29:07.066 --> 29:08.266
She's fine.

29:08.333 --> 29:10.300
She's had a bad dream is all.

29:14.433 --> 29:16.000
We're getting so close.

29:16.066 --> 29:18.233
Well, it doesn't
feel like that from this side.

29:18.300 --> 29:21.533
That's because the dream
is completely subjective.

29:21.600 --> 29:24.200
To me, we're making
great progress.

29:24.266 --> 29:26.233
But my nightmares,
they haven't even stopped yet.

29:26.300 --> 29:29.033
That's it. See, you're finally
getting in touch with yourself.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.833
It's gonna get a lot worse
before it gets any better.

29:30.900 --> 29:31.833
Great.

29:33.533 --> 29:36.133
All I want is to
make you feel again.

29:41.233 --> 29:43.200
If my method's not working, I..

29:43.266 --> 29:45.066
...can't ask you to..

29:45.133 --> 29:46.766
...go through all this
just so I can..

29:46.833 --> 29:48.133
...find the right answer.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.300
So you're giving up.

29:49.366 --> 29:50.366
No, but..

29:50.433 --> 29:52.533
...you gotta want it.

29:52.600 --> 29:55.300
I mean, you got to trust me.

29:55.366 --> 29:57.533
- Let your dreams go.
- It's not that easy.

29:58.600 --> 30:00.233
I don't know if I can.
I'm afraid.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.366
I feel like
there's something in there

30:01.433 --> 30:02.866
waiting, waiting for me.

30:02.933 --> 30:04.866
Then let's go find it.

30:04.933 --> 30:06.000
Okay, together.

30:13.500 --> 30:15.800
Okay.

30:15.866 --> 30:18.366
I'll try it again.

30:18.433 --> 30:19.900
I got to go.

30:46.966 --> 30:48.766
You can't force somebody
to confront their demons.

30:48.833 --> 30:50.666
Especially, in their dreams.

30:50.733 --> 30:53.166
No, but I can help it along
a little bit.

30:53.233 --> 30:55.933
You know, a few sounds,
a light show.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.966
Damn it. I'm not talking
about one of your lab rats here.

31:00.033 --> 31:01.200
She's not going into this blind

31:01.266 --> 31:03.133
I explained it all to her
yesterday.

31:03.200 --> 31:05.733
Yeah, I'll bet you did.

31:05.800 --> 31:09.833
Gary, we're on the road to
a scientific breakthrough here.

31:09.900 --> 31:12.966
I mean, if we pull this off
think of the people we can help.

31:13.033 --> 31:14.333
There's a line out there
somewhere

31:14.400 --> 31:15.933
I don't know where it is
but I got a feeling

31:16.000 --> 31:17.966
in my gut that tells me
we're just about to cross it.

31:18.033 --> 31:20.866
Gary, we crossed it.
A long time ago.

31:20.933 --> 31:22.933
We should keep on crossing it.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.866
That's the difference between us
and those pompous

31:24.933 --> 31:26.600
figureheads out there
who are going to be teaching

31:26.666 --> 31:28.100
at this school
for the rest of their lives.

31:28.166 --> 31:31.100
Look...just one question.

31:32.500 --> 31:34.433
What happens when we go too far?

31:36.100 --> 31:38.133
What happens is you
find an answer

31:38.200 --> 31:40.300
nobody's even written
the question for yet.

31:42.266 --> 31:43.800
Nobody ever misspells
your name again.

32:02.200 --> 32:05.533
Hey, babe. More power to you.

32:40.533 --> 32:41.500
Marsha?

32:43.466 --> 32:44.433
Marsha!

32:45.500 --> 32:47.233
Marsha! Talk to me.

32:47.300 --> 32:49.100
- Get away from me!
- Tell me what you see.

32:49.166 --> 32:50.566
- No!
- Marsha.

32:50.633 --> 32:52.600
Masha, who's in there with you?

32:52.666 --> 32:53.966
Is it your grandmother?

32:54.033 --> 32:56.066
No.

32:56.133 --> 32:58.300
Who is it?

32:58.366 --> 32:59.400
Freddy.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.200
'Zach, did we
have to come here?'

33:12.266 --> 33:13.733
'Yes, we did.'

33:13.800 --> 33:15.300
'Why?'

33:15.366 --> 33:17.300
To help your imagination.

33:24.933 --> 33:26.733
I don't like it here, Zach.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.766
I don't like it here at all.

33:28.833 --> 33:30.800
Which is why it's perfect.

33:34.633 --> 33:36.600
I don't know, Zach.

33:47.433 --> 33:48.866
Look..

33:48.933 --> 33:50.633
...we're onto something
major here.

33:50.700 --> 33:52.766
Freddy is major league.

33:52.833 --> 33:56.033
You can't just dream him,
you got to experience him.

33:56.100 --> 33:57.900
You got to open yourself up.

33:59.366 --> 34:00.900
What was that?

34:05.700 --> 34:07.700
Where do you figure
he stashed the bodies?

34:08.833 --> 34:10.133
In there?

34:11.966 --> 34:13.433
Or there?

34:15.466 --> 34:16.900
Down there.

34:18.500 --> 34:20.200
Whoosh!

34:20.266 --> 34:22.000
Zach, I don't need you
to do this, okay?

34:22.066 --> 34:24.033
I can dream on my own.

34:25.366 --> 34:26.933
Let's go!

34:29.633 --> 34:30.800
Zach?

34:31.800 --> 34:32.900
Zach?

34:39.900 --> 34:40.833
'Zach?'

34:55.633 --> 34:56.833
Zach?

34:59.700 --> 35:01.200
Dammit, Zach!

35:02.800 --> 35:04.433
Where are you?

35:31.700 --> 35:33.633
Zach, this isn't gonna work.

35:35.466 --> 35:36.500
I'm tired of being scared.

35:36.566 --> 35:38.933
I'm not gonna be scared anymore.

35:41.100 --> 35:43.333
Zach, do you hear me?

35:57.433 --> 35:58.733
Enough.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.633
That's it. I quit.

36:06.433 --> 36:07.866
Zach?

36:13.000 --> 36:15.133
'Help me. Help me.'

36:15.766 --> 36:17.333
Who's there?

36:22.966 --> 36:24.100
Who's there?

36:26.366 --> 36:28.700
Help.

36:28.766 --> 36:30.633
- Hello!
- 'Help.'

36:32.000 --> 36:33.500
Help me.

36:33.566 --> 36:35.033
Please, help me.

36:35.100 --> 36:36.633
Help me. Help me.

36:36.700 --> 36:38.800
- Help me.
- I'll help you.

36:38.866 --> 36:40.833
Don't worry.
I'll get you out of here.

36:47.433 --> 36:50.766
Freddy! Freddy's coming.
It's him.

36:50.833 --> 36:51.833
Hurry!

36:55.433 --> 36:58.633
Hurry. Hurry!

37:02.933 --> 37:04.900
'Zach!'

37:12.666 --> 37:14.100
What the hell.

37:24.266 --> 37:28.733
Help me! Help me!

37:30.700 --> 37:32.666
Dammit!

37:32.733 --> 37:34.166
Losing the tr..
Dammit!

37:39.033 --> 37:41.200
Help me!

37:45.233 --> 37:46.833
Marsha. Marsha.

37:46.900 --> 37:48.333
Marsha, wake up.

37:49.666 --> 37:51.833
Marsha! Marsha! Wake up.

37:51.900 --> 37:53.100
Wake up.

37:54.633 --> 37:56.100
- Okay.
- Zach.

37:58.133 --> 37:59.100
He's onto me, Zach.

37:59.166 --> 38:00.833
It's not safe for me
to go back in there.

38:00.900 --> 38:02.366
I can't go back in there alone.

38:02.433 --> 38:04.700
I can't go back, Zach.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.633
It's okay.
You don't have to.

38:15.166 --> 38:17.333
Still I'm going back
in with you.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.166
Help me.

38:29.233 --> 38:32.033
Help me, please. Help me.

38:38.766 --> 38:41.533
Help me, please. Help me.

38:45.966 --> 38:48.433
I-I never thought
you'd get this far, Zach.

38:49.600 --> 38:53.266
When you first proposed
recording dreams, I..

38:53.333 --> 38:55.600
I thought your theory
was science-fiction.

38:56.600 --> 38:59.266
These results
are truly remarkable.

38:59.333 --> 39:00.533
The clarity of the picture
is determined

39:00.600 --> 39:02.533
by the intensity of the dream.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.266
This is nothing yet.

39:04.333 --> 39:05.933
How would you elicit
a greater response?

39:06.000 --> 39:08.500
If-if a little fear stimulus
got this response

39:08.566 --> 39:10.600
think of what
a lot of fear will do.

39:10.666 --> 39:12.533
We got to take her to the edge.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.733
The edge?
She came in here on the edge.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.766
It's our job to pull her back,
not push her over.

39:16.833 --> 39:19.466
We're eliminating
years of psychotherapy here.

39:19.533 --> 39:21.033
Instead of lying on a couc

39:21.100 --> 39:23.300
grasping and piecing together
her subconscious

39:23.366 --> 39:24.900
she can kick back over
a TV dinner

39:24.966 --> 39:26.966
and watch her own nightmar
over and over

39:27.033 --> 39:28.433
till it means nothing,
it's like summer reruns.

39:28.500 --> 39:31.200
And what if she can't handle it?

39:31.266 --> 39:33.933
Wait a minute, is this Marsha,
a research volunteer

39:34.000 --> 39:36.166
or a psychiatric patient?

39:36.233 --> 39:37.500
That's irrelevant.

39:37.566 --> 39:38.733
Oh, it's crazy to let him go on.

39:38.800 --> 39:39.833
He's so obsessed
with this project

39:39.900 --> 39:40.933
he doesn't even care about--

39:41.000 --> 39:42.666
Zip it up, Gary!
I know what I'm doing.

39:42.733 --> 39:43.833
Zach!

39:44.633 --> 39:46.533
Look..

39:46.600 --> 39:49.400
...your purpose was to create
a device that records

39:49.466 --> 39:51.633
and plays back dreams.

39:51.700 --> 39:54.233
And it's obvious,
you've made some strides.

39:56.666 --> 39:59.700
But you're abusing
the test subject.

39:59.766 --> 40:03.900
Look, if you push it too far,
if-if something happens

40:03.966 --> 40:08.100
you, me, this entire university,
we will be held accountable.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.133
It ends here.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.100
Then it's over?

40:33.166 --> 40:35.300
'Yeah, they pulled the plug.'

40:36.566 --> 40:38.166
Zach, but why?

40:38.233 --> 40:40.100
'Cause they're fools.

40:40.166 --> 40:43.200
Fools always fear the unknown.

40:43.266 --> 40:45.300
Look, they think that
I'm pushing you into something

40:45.366 --> 40:47.500
against your will.
Something-something dangerous.

40:47.566 --> 40:49.533
But, Zach, I don't wanna stop.

40:52.466 --> 40:54.433
I wanna go back.

41:14.833 --> 41:15.800
Zach?

41:21.133 --> 41:22.533
Zach?

41:41.166 --> 41:42.400
Zach?

42:22.333 --> 42:23.333
Hello?

42:25.366 --> 42:27.133
Little girl?

42:27.200 --> 42:29.133
Where are you?

42:51.500 --> 42:53.833
Hey. It's okay.

42:56.433 --> 43:01.333
Poor baby.
Tell daddy all about it.

43:03.733 --> 43:07.433
Don't worry, I'll be gentle.

43:25.266 --> 43:26.900
Zach!

43:28.100 --> 43:29.966
- Zach!
- Dream!

43:30.033 --> 43:31.666
Dream, give me something
I can use to fight.

43:31.733 --> 43:32.766
Zach!

43:32.833 --> 43:35.000
Think of it
as the ultimate stimulus.

43:39.566 --> 43:41.133
'Zach!'

43:50.300 --> 43:52.066
Marsha?

43:52.133 --> 43:53.633
Two for one day.

43:53.700 --> 43:55.166
I'm in your dream.

43:55.233 --> 43:57.966
You said we'd go in together!

45:00.066 --> 45:01.533
Marsha?

45:01.600 --> 45:03.400
Two for one day.

45:03.466 --> 45:05.166
I'm in your dream.

45:05.233 --> 45:06.566
It's too late, Zach.

45:06.633 --> 45:08.600
He wants you.

45:13.633 --> 45:15.600
It's your nightmare now.

45:29.833 --> 45:32.500
Stick that in your VCR

45:32.566 --> 45:34.533
then suck on it.
