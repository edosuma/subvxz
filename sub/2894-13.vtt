WEBVTT

00:03.303 --> 00:05.070
(people shouting)

00:11.011 --> 00:13.645
Captain america: I thought
you said this thing
had a targeting system, tony.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.047
Can't get a bead on that ship,

00:15.049 --> 00:17.082
And it's starting
to get hairy up here.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.586
Show time.

00:25.792 --> 00:27.793
(grunts)
and now they got
their hooks into us.

00:27.795 --> 00:30.095
Don't know who's crazy enough
to attack us,

00:30.097 --> 00:32.296
But it's time to end this,
iron man.

00:35.168 --> 00:37.169
Iron man:
What's up, crossbones?

00:37.604 --> 00:40.339
Want to just give up
and save yourself
the embarrassment?

00:41.441 --> 00:44.043
Hmm. They always choose
embarrassment.

00:45.678 --> 00:48.614
(grunts) hold on.
Stabilizers are shot.

00:48.815 --> 00:51.784
<i>So, fluffy, what would</i>
<i>you find on the outside</i>
<i>of a tree?</i>

00:51.786 --> 00:53.652
(barks)

00:54.821 --> 00:56.688
(grunts)

00:58.758 --> 01:00.459
(grunts)
(crowd gasps)

01:00.727 --> 01:02.094
Stay back.

01:02.096 --> 01:03.595
<i>We have this under control.</i>

01:04.730 --> 01:06.498
B-level move, crossbones,

01:06.733 --> 01:08.600
Attacking us by yourself.

01:08.802 --> 01:11.737
Myself?
Didn't you hear, stark?

01:11.739 --> 01:14.106
It's bring-a-pal-to-work day.

01:14.307 --> 01:15.507
<i>Anyone hurt?</i>

01:15.509 --> 01:16.575
(groans)

01:16.577 --> 01:20.212
<i>Should've installed</i>
<i>rear-view mirrors</i>
<i>on that thing, stark.</i>

01:20.214 --> 01:20.212
Grim reaper?

01:20.214 --> 01:23.816
What, is there a pirate theme
going on here

01:23.818 --> 01:25.684
That I didn't get
the memo for?

01:25.852 --> 01:27.519
(growls)

01:27.754 --> 01:29.188
(groaning)

01:30.657 --> 01:30.656
Female reporter:
Dbc exclusive,

01:30.658 --> 01:34.359
Iron man and captain america
under attack.

01:37.497 --> 01:39.164
Iron man!

01:42.469 --> 01:43.869
No!

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:56.749 --> 01:58.484
Crossbones: This the location?

01:58.486 --> 02:00.819
Grim reaper:
Unless the onboard
on my ship was lying.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.855
Why so jumpy, crossbones?

02:02.857 --> 02:05.124
You aren't gonna
blow this, are you?

02:05.126 --> 02:07.659
I thought all things hydra
was your deal.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.428
It's not me
I'm worried about.

02:09.430 --> 02:12.297
Just stick to the plan,
keep the surprises
to a minimum,

02:12.432 --> 02:14.133
And we might just
make this work.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.802
Surprises?  <i>Moi? </i> (scoffs)

02:20.874 --> 02:22.407
(mechanical whirring)

02:23.910 --> 02:25.777
You're the muscle
on this team.

02:25.779 --> 02:28.247
He ain't just gettin' up
and walkin' in.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.589
Grim reaper: (on speaker)
<i>open up.</i>

02:37.857 --> 02:39.224
This good enough
to get us

02:39.226 --> 02:42.494
Into your little
villain club, red skull?

02:48.568 --> 02:49.801
(chuckles)

02:49.803 --> 02:51.904
Launch the sub.

02:54.507 --> 02:55.874
Sub?

02:55.876 --> 02:58.177
Did you know this thing
was a sub?

03:01.881 --> 03:05.217
Grim reaper: Volcano base,
space station, sub...
What's the diff?

03:05.885 --> 03:07.886
We're here. Smile.

03:08.922 --> 03:12.925
M.O.D.O.K.,
shall I destroy them
for wasting our time?

03:13.660 --> 03:15.194
(rumbling)
what?

03:18.565 --> 03:21.833
No, it's definitely
stark's armor.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.602
Let's see what's inside.

03:23.604 --> 03:26.772
Already tried.
The tech is...
Awesome.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.574
It's not going to be easy
to crack.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.676
Don't insult me
by assuming you possess

03:30.678 --> 03:32.978
Anything close
to my scientific expertise.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.847
You're positive
that it's on lockdown?

03:35.849 --> 03:37.282
Why are you asking me?

03:37.284 --> 03:39.484
Do I look like tony stark
to you?

03:41.788 --> 03:43.589
(humming)

03:45.558 --> 03:48.994
He's imbedded neuro-inhibitors
into this armor!

03:48.996 --> 03:53.432
Undoubtedly to protect
himself from my
technopathic abilities.

03:53.434 --> 03:56.868
Does your scientific
expertise-ness
need a wrench?

03:56.870 --> 03:56.868
Quiet!

03:56.870 --> 04:01.273
As the saying goes,
there's more than one way

04:01.275 --> 04:03.375
To crack an... Egg!

04:04.477 --> 04:06.912
Iron man: These chuckleheads
got lucky and locked my armor.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.715
But that doesn't mean
I'm out of the game.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.484
What? I warned him.
(modok growls)

04:12.486 --> 04:14.753
Bring this iron carcass
to my lab.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.856
I will rip that armor apart
piece by piece.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.994
It appears
you are competent after all.

04:22.562 --> 04:25.397
There might be room for you
in our cabal.

04:25.832 --> 04:27.799
(quietly) score.

04:28.835 --> 04:32.404
It is said that, together,
the avengers can face threats

04:32.406 --> 04:34.573
No single hero can.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.875
Then...
(scanner beeps)

04:37.343 --> 04:40.979
It is only fitting that we,
their greatest foes,
work together

04:41.414 --> 04:44.383
In order to destroy them.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.319
This is bigger than
we could have ever imagined.

04:47.321 --> 04:50.355
Yeah, and I can
imagine pretty big.

04:50.357 --> 04:52.624
Breathtaking, is it not?

04:52.626 --> 04:56.728
We are building an army unlike
any the world has ever seen.

04:56.730 --> 04:56.728
How many
troops you have?

04:56.730 --> 05:00.399
More importantly,
what are you paying them?

05:00.401 --> 05:02.567
What's the date and location
of our next target?

05:02.569 --> 05:05.537
Grim reaper: What kind
of power source
does this sub use?

05:05.539 --> 05:10.442
These are sophisticated
questions for mere
foot-soldiers.

05:10.710 --> 05:11.877
Foot-soldiers?

05:11.879 --> 05:11.877
We took down iron man.

05:11.879 --> 05:16.648
Which, when we last checked,
you failed to do.
(hissing)

05:17.950 --> 05:21.453
Skull, who are these
blood sacks?

05:21.455 --> 05:23.455
We don't like their smell.

05:23.856 --> 05:26.725
Vampires? You have
vampires on board?

05:26.859 --> 05:29.361
(hisses)
grim reaper:
Step off, green teeth.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.762
Reaper, what are you doing?

05:30.764 --> 05:33.465
We don't like vampires,
bones. Remember?

05:33.599 --> 05:35.701
They can take over
anyone they bite.

05:35.703 --> 05:36.935
Not good for us.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.036
(grunts)

05:46.079 --> 05:47.346
(roars)

05:49.615 --> 05:52.417
How the...
Red skull: M.O.D.O.K.'s
security protocols

05:52.419 --> 05:54.753
Dampen all tech
aboard this sub.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.622
It keeps everyone
on their best behavior.

05:57.624 --> 06:01.960
Further hostilities
between members
will be dealt with severely.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.731
Dracula will hear
of this outrage.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.102
Dracula? Part of the cabal?

06:10.670 --> 06:13.839
You have no idea
of the power we've amassed.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.574
(alarm blaring)

06:16.542 --> 06:18.377
Our guest has arrived.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.946
Guest? We've gotta be
2,000 feet down by now.
Who...

06:20.948 --> 06:22.414
Red skull: All stations,

06:22.416 --> 06:23.982
Attuma's here.

06:25.985 --> 06:26.885
Both: Attuma?

06:31.824 --> 06:35.160
Skull, attuma,
warlord of atlantis,

06:35.162 --> 06:36.895
Has done as he has promised.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.864
He has the weapon.

06:38.866 --> 06:43.602
Now let us see
if you can do as you claim.

06:46.839 --> 06:46.838
Come, warlord.

06:46.840 --> 06:52.411
You will see that
everything we agreed to
is going as planned.

06:55.848 --> 06:57.816
See to his soldiers.

06:57.818 --> 07:00.852
If the weapon does
what lord attuma promises,

07:00.987 --> 07:04.623
Our war against the avengers
ends today.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.828
There's no technology
that you can build

07:09.830 --> 07:12.497
That I cannot undo.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.968
(electronic pulsing)

07:18.137 --> 07:21.006
I'm coming for you, stark.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.043
(growls) an empty shell!

07:25.045 --> 07:26.711
We were tricked!

07:26.846 --> 07:29.748
We are hungry. Bring us food!

07:30.016 --> 07:33.485
You didn't just tell a guy
who calls himself
the grim reaper

07:33.487 --> 07:35.620
To bring you food, did you?

07:35.855 --> 07:36.888
(shouting)

07:37.824 --> 07:40.492
What would you fellas like?
A knuckle sandwich?

07:40.793 --> 07:42.093
You've seen enough, then?

07:42.095 --> 07:44.062
Oh, yeah.
I've seen enough.

07:44.497 --> 07:46.231
<i>Reaper and crossbones</i>
<i>betrayed us.</i>

07:46.233 --> 07:48.600
<i>Bring them</i>
<i>to my lab immediately!</i>

07:48.602 --> 07:51.002
Hey, stark tricked us, too,
m.O.D.O.K.

07:51.170 --> 07:53.905
Yeah, how were we
supposed to know

07:53.907 --> 07:55.240
That stark
wasn't in his armor?

07:56.008 --> 07:59.878
Oh, because I am stark.
(chuckles)

08:02.215 --> 08:04.015
Modok: Security breach!

08:04.017 --> 08:07.853
Tony stark and steve rogers
have infiltrated our ranks!

08:07.855 --> 08:10.522
All hands to the aqua port!

08:10.723 --> 08:11.923
(struggling)

08:15.962 --> 08:17.662
Great. Couldn't you
have done that

08:17.664 --> 08:19.564
Before they pulled off
our masks?

08:19.566 --> 08:21.800
Me? You practically
did everything but surrender.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.503
What was that shock stunt
you pulled
on m.O.D.O.K. Earlier?

08:24.505 --> 08:26.838
It's called
establishing credibility.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.841
Tony stark would never
let m.O.D.O.K. Touch his armor

08:29.843 --> 08:33.645
Without giving him
a 20,000 volt iron slap.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.780
I know you're enjoying
the role-playing thing, tony,

08:35.782 --> 08:38.116
But we gotta put an end
to this game.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.217
Targets identified.
Lock on to
these coordinates.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.554
Avengers, assemble!

08:42.788 --> 08:45.824
Hold up. My line.
Avengers, assemble!

08:46.225 --> 08:49.027
Something's blocking
the card's transmission.

08:49.629 --> 08:51.062
Okay, I'll just
summon my armor,

08:51.064 --> 08:52.864
And it'll be
iron man to the...

08:53.165 --> 08:55.800
M.O.D.O.K. Dampeners.
He's targeted our tech.

08:55.802 --> 08:57.702
What's the location
on the hostiles?

09:00.640 --> 09:03.608
12 o'clock, 9 o'clock,
5 o'clock.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.578
Okay, option one,
we escape through
the aqua port

09:06.580 --> 09:06.578
Into the water.
(groans)

09:06.580 --> 09:11.016
Options two, fight
our way through to the skull's
communication center,

09:11.018 --> 09:12.851
And call the avengers
from there.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.052
Or option awesome,

09:14.054 --> 09:16.021
I hack into m.O.D.O.K.'s
tracking systems,

09:16.023 --> 09:17.956
Sneak into his lab,
and get my armor back.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.125
No, tony,
we don't have time.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.127
There's always time
when you're tony stark...

09:22.129 --> 09:23.194
(alarm beeping)

09:23.663 --> 09:24.729
Uh-oh.

09:25.698 --> 09:27.332
(soldiers groaning)

09:29.602 --> 09:31.736
M.O.D.O.K.! Where are they?

09:32.204 --> 09:33.338
Modok: (on speaker)
<i>I can't trace them.</i>

09:33.340 --> 09:35.807
<i>Stark must have</i>
<i>hacked my systems!</i>

09:36.309 --> 09:39.177
Pathetic. Search the sub!

09:39.912 --> 09:40.879
You, atlantians,

09:40.881 --> 09:42.647
Check outside the ship.

09:43.015 --> 09:46.651
My warriors only take orders
from me, skull.

09:46.886 --> 09:49.020
Then tell them, attuma.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.323
Attuma: I would watch
your tongue, skeleton.

09:51.824 --> 09:55.961
This tin box of yours
is floating in my ocean.

09:56.796 --> 09:59.731
Your ocean
has avengers in it.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.735
(laughs)

10:04.203 --> 10:06.638
Warriors, search the waters.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.808
I will not risk the avengers
stealing our prize.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.911
Looks like their little cabal
ain't the well-oiled machine

10:12.913 --> 10:14.613
Skull made it out to be.

10:14.847 --> 10:16.047
Sounds familiar.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.382
What? What are you saying?

10:17.384 --> 10:20.685
I barely got you inside
this air shaft in time.
You put us in...

10:20.687 --> 10:21.953
(stammers) what are you...
I blinded m.O.D.O.K.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.189
You wanted to go down swimming
or swinging?

10:24.390 --> 10:27.192
As far as I can tell,
those are still
our only two options.

10:30.763 --> 10:32.998
Captain america:
I knew this plan
was a load of hooey.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.967
Skull must have
put the knuckle down
on rogers.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.770
People, we got trouble
with a capital t.

10:38.772 --> 10:41.873
Worst cap impression
ever, hawkeye.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.142
What? Cap totally
talks like that.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.645
(imitating captain america)
falcon, what's
the status on their...

10:46.647 --> 10:49.014
Uh, what's the old-timey
lingo for "location?"

10:49.016 --> 10:50.348
Their signal went on the move.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.317
Some kind of
underwater transport.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.685
I can't find it anywhere.

10:53.819 --> 10:54.919
You should have sent me.

10:54.921 --> 10:57.355
I'm the professional spy,
remember?

10:57.357 --> 11:00.825
Ah, reaper's and crossbones'
costumes wouldn't fit you.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.293
I'm gonna hook up
with s.H.I.E.L.D.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.695
To try and track them
another way.

11:03.863 --> 11:05.797
Or we could just ask them.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.332
Hulk style.
(hulk growls)

11:08.034 --> 11:10.168
I like that idea.
(knuckles crack)

11:12.304 --> 11:14.873
M.O.D.O.K.'s power dampener
is most likely activated

11:14.875 --> 11:17.008
By the black box
on his forehead.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.377
We shut it down,
and I can reactivate
my armor.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.012
Ugh, not that again.

11:21.014 --> 11:24.282
We got skull,
m.O.D.O.K., and attuma
out looking for us.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.251
We need to get
a signal back to
the rest of the team,

11:26.253 --> 11:28.753
And even up these...
Hold on. What is that?

11:29.255 --> 11:31.256
That's the thing
attuma brought on board.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.858
Iron man: Skull said
something about
ending the war today.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.994
From the looks
of those power signatures,

11:35.996 --> 11:35.994
He may be on to something.

11:35.996 --> 11:39.931
Hydra agent:
These atlantians are
stinkin' up the whole sub.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.299
We found them!

11:44.136 --> 11:46.838
No time for flight,
moving to
the fight option.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.974
You know, this would be
a lot easier if I had my armor

11:49.976 --> 11:51.376
And you had your shield...

11:51.777 --> 11:53.745
And we had the hulk.

11:53.913 --> 11:55.847
You're not looking at this
in the right way, tony.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.082
Step one, ask yourself,

11:58.084 --> 12:00.018
"what would
a science whiz do?"

12:00.020 --> 12:01.252
Step two...

12:02.288 --> 12:05.056
I distract the target
and let the whiz do his biz.

12:07.993 --> 12:09.994
Hydra agent:
It's not me, it's stark!
He's doing it!

12:14.767 --> 12:17.001
Step three,
we enjoy the view.

12:17.503 --> 12:19.270
That actually worked.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.406
Because that,
my friend...

12:21.907 --> 12:23.341
Was a...
(vampires hissing)

12:27.046 --> 12:28.947
Never thought I'd be happy
to see vampires,

12:28.949 --> 12:31.883
But they're saving me
from one of your "lectures."

12:32.084 --> 12:33.785
(growling)

12:42.428 --> 12:43.895
(glass cracking)

12:43.897 --> 12:45.430
(hydra agents
shouting in distance)

12:46.966 --> 12:48.967
(vampires hissing)
(glass cracking)

12:50.402 --> 12:52.170
Steve, hold your breath.

12:52.972 --> 12:54.806
No! That's not a plan!

12:56.008 --> 12:57.342
(alarm blaring)

13:02.982 --> 13:04.549
They must
have escaped!

13:04.551 --> 13:06.885
What kind of a technopath

13:06.887 --> 13:08.953
Can't find two humans
on a submarine

13:08.955 --> 13:10.522
That he has
complete control over?

13:10.923 --> 13:12.891
They will be captured
soon enough, skull.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.393
They cannot
escape me forever.

13:15.928 --> 13:19.430
Besides, stark is powerless
without his armor.

13:20.032 --> 13:21.366
Just like you.

13:22.101 --> 13:24.202
Do not push me, m.O.D.O.K.

13:24.436 --> 13:27.872
No one's place
in this cabal is secure.

13:28.073 --> 13:29.007
(growls)

13:30.209 --> 13:32.177
Hydra agent:
Sir, the trident is free.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.112
At last.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.981
Iron man: Oh, I don't like
the sounds of that.

13:36.983 --> 13:36.981
We have to stop them.

13:36.983 --> 13:41.019
And this time,
we're not marching in
and making it up as we go.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.987
Look, I admit it,

13:42.989 --> 13:45.590
If you hadn't come up
with this plan to
infiltrate the cabal,

13:45.592 --> 13:48.359
We never would have learned
how serious this was getting.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.228
Thanks, but...

13:50.830 --> 13:53.331
But with my armor gone,

13:53.933 --> 13:56.234
All I can do is improvise.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.570
Steve, even
without your shield,

13:58.572 --> 14:00.905
You're still captain america.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.041
Without my armor, I'm just...

14:03.043 --> 14:05.944
Tony stark! The tony stark.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.946
Billionaire genius.

14:07.948 --> 14:11.015
You're probably one
of the three smartest men
in the entire world.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.584
You're as tough as they come.

14:12.586 --> 14:14.219
You invented hardcore.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.988
The avengers are lucky
you're on our side.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.424
Really? You know two people
smarter than me?

14:19.859 --> 14:21.226
Can't you just
take a compliment?

14:28.968 --> 14:31.369
Neptune's trident.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.538
Weapon of the gods!

14:33.540 --> 14:36.307
The power of the ocean itself!

14:37.076 --> 14:39.410
The avengers shall fall,

14:39.412 --> 14:44.282
And all the nations
of the world shall
tremble before us.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.484
Okay, I've got a plan.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.086
You do? What is it?

14:48.088 --> 14:50.021
Get caught.
Wait!

14:51.023 --> 14:54.592
Hey! Anyone know
where I can get
a giant salad fork?

14:57.997 --> 14:59.998
Do you even know
what a plan is?

15:02.434 --> 15:06.104
So, tony stark
and steve rogers.

15:06.672 --> 15:10.375
I should have guessed that
stark would do something
as impulsive as this.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.677
But you, captain, surprise me.

15:13.345 --> 15:17.215
Here without shields
or armor to protect you.

15:18.017 --> 15:20.451
Now you will both pay for it.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.155
Not sure I'm seeing
the brilliance
of this plan yet, tony.

15:24.356 --> 15:27.325
You just aren't
looking close enough, steve.

15:29.561 --> 15:32.297
Time to find out
if the trident of neptune

15:32.299 --> 15:34.232
Lives up to its legend.

15:34.433 --> 15:35.533
(rumbling)

15:35.535 --> 15:37.168
What are you doing?

15:39.405 --> 15:41.139
You'll rupture the hull!

15:50.549 --> 15:52.050
(evil laughter)

15:56.722 --> 15:57.989
Red skull: It's true!

15:57.991 --> 16:01.025
The power to command the sea!

16:05.397 --> 16:07.999
Wow. You'll really
kill them in vegas.

16:08.167 --> 16:10.068
You mock us, stark.

16:10.070 --> 16:13.571
With this trident,
we have just weaponized water.

16:13.573 --> 16:17.275
Three quarters of the earth
is now the cabal's to control.

16:17.509 --> 16:19.177
You can have the hudson river.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.445
Put a sock in it.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.512
Huh?

16:22.081 --> 16:23.181
Huh?
Hmm?

16:24.116 --> 16:24.115
Seriously, is there
an off-switch on that mouth?

16:24.117 --> 16:29.153
Skull just told you
that he's going to hold
the entire world hostage,

16:29.155 --> 16:30.588
And you're cracking jokes?

16:30.590 --> 16:33.124
You're the only
joke here, rogers.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.193
You super-soldiers
are all alike.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.462
Living off the work
of smarter men.

16:37.763 --> 16:41.366
Case in point, m.O.D.O.K.
He took my armor.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.368
All skull did
was put it on.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.570
And now look
who's holding the trident.

16:46.572 --> 16:51.309
Skull! You don't plan
on keeping the trident
for only yourself.

16:51.510 --> 16:54.312
Only one can wield it
at a time.

16:54.314 --> 16:57.081
That was not our agreement.

16:57.383 --> 16:59.083
You released it for attuma.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.486
Its power is derived
from the ocean.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.321
I am its rightful lord!

17:03.689 --> 17:08.026
No! I caught these two.
They're mine to destroy!

17:08.193 --> 17:09.761
Attuma: You dare?

17:09.762 --> 17:11.295
I am a king!

17:11.297 --> 17:14.232
You are nothing
but the skull's lapdog.

17:14.233 --> 17:17.268
King? Ha!
You're a fishmonger.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.203
I am m.O.D.O.K.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.471
Master of science!

17:21.106 --> 17:24.541
Enough! Don't' you see
they seek to divide us?

17:24.710 --> 17:27.178
They are playing you
for fools!

17:27.378 --> 17:31.783
I have had enough
of your insults,
iron skull!

17:31.785 --> 17:33.217
Iron man: Hey, m.O.Dork!

17:33.219 --> 17:35.620
You've got something
on your forehead.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.089
(grunts)

17:38.690 --> 17:39.757
(electrical pulse)

17:44.263 --> 17:44.262
Captain america:
We all good now?

17:44.264 --> 17:48.099
Iron man:  <i>We will be.</i>
<i>In about 10 seconds.</i>

17:49.568 --> 17:51.636
Stall him!
Consider him stalled.

17:52.271 --> 17:53.337
(straining)

18:10.622 --> 18:11.689
(exclaims)

18:17.763 --> 18:18.830
(grunts)

18:20.766 --> 18:23.134
Not this time, avengers.

18:23.502 --> 18:24.569
What?

18:25.104 --> 18:27.338
What can I say?
I dress to impress.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.411
You're too late
to stop me, stark.

18:33.579 --> 18:36.647
Not even your armor
can save you from this.

18:49.628 --> 18:50.695
(groaning)

18:50.896 --> 18:52.263
Tony!

18:53.232 --> 18:54.465
Skull!

18:57.302 --> 18:59.837
You think too small, skull.

18:59.839 --> 19:05.143
Attuma shall show you
the true power
of the seven seas!

19:09.848 --> 19:11.182
(all grunting)

19:14.686 --> 19:16.187
(grunts)

19:19.525 --> 19:20.591
No...

19:25.197 --> 19:26.764
Tony, do your thing.

19:27.866 --> 19:29.167
Done.

19:40.245 --> 19:41.479
No.

19:41.747 --> 19:44.348
You fools! Do you realize
what you've done?

19:44.683 --> 19:47.251
Yeah, stopped you
from ruling the world.

19:47.419 --> 19:51.322
You've unleashed
the power of neptune!

19:51.823 --> 19:53.891
You have angered
the ocean itself!

19:55.394 --> 19:57.228
(groaning)

19:57.230 --> 19:58.362
Abandon ship!

20:01.200 --> 20:02.400
Steve, hold on.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.275
(screaming)

20:17.849 --> 20:20.418
The force of the whirlpool
is dragging us down.

20:20.819 --> 20:24.889
Steve, I'm sorry.
My armor, it's not enough.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.224
(electronics power down)

20:30.896 --> 20:32.263
Don't worry!

20:32.265 --> 20:34.765
Why not?
Seems like a good time.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.368
When m.O.D.O.K.'s
power dampener
was destroyed,

20:37.536 --> 20:38.970
I called them.

20:56.955 --> 20:58.789
Thanks for the lift, hawkeye.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.825
(imitating captain america)
no problem, bucko.

21:01.860 --> 21:03.561
I'll explain later.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.695
Where's the cabal?

21:06.565 --> 21:08.599
20,000 leagues
under the sea,

21:08.601 --> 21:10.668
Reevaluating
their partnership.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.305
I'm surprised
you guys survived each other,

21:14.307 --> 21:14.305
Much less the cabal.

21:14.307 --> 21:18.943
I recently learned
it doesn't hurt
to have a plan sometimes.

21:18.945 --> 21:18.943
Oh, now,
isn't that ironic?

21:18.945 --> 21:23.547
'cause I learned that
sometimes you should
just follow your gut.

21:24.950 --> 21:28.653
So, like, are you pals
gonna hug now, or what?

21:30.656 --> 21:32.456
Captain america:
Why are you
still wearing my uniform?
