WEBVTT

00:00.389 --> 00:02.323
- Ah, Moon pies.
- What?

00:02.352 --> 00:05.324
Well, it's the wonderful part of a
road-trip. Stopping for Moon pies.

00:05.354 --> 00:06.564
Mom, I want to go. I can't.

00:06.595 --> 00:09.389
I know. I know.
End of semester -- lots of work.

00:09.419 --> 00:10.969
Not lots -- tons. I'm sorry.

00:10.999 --> 00:12.105
Yeah, yeah.

00:12.444 --> 00:13.982
- It's just --
- What "it's just"?

00:14.012 --> 00:16.279
Well, it's just, you know, a shame

00:16.309 --> 00:18.453
to miss the wedding of a woman
who meant so much to you.

00:18.485 --> 00:21.380
Mom, I talked to Mia.
I apologized profusely.

00:21.414 --> 00:24.860
I told her that it was simply impossible
for me to drop everything now

00:24.899 --> 00:26.458
and go to North Carolina.
No, right?

00:26.481 --> 00:27.594
- No.
- Yeah.

00:27.629 --> 00:29.503
- She totally understood.
- Of course, she understood.

00:29.538 --> 00:32.853
She understood when I was 17
and I arrived at the Inn,

00:32.887 --> 00:34.962
holding a little,
tiny baby in my arms,

00:34.996 --> 00:36.492
and rain was pouring down.

00:36.526 --> 00:37.863
As long as you're
not milking this.

00:37.897 --> 00:41.422
And she understood when you broke that
teacup of hers, the english rose pattern

00:41.458 --> 00:42.843
- when you were 4.
- Okay, mom.

00:42.875 --> 00:46.321
Yeah, I think that was an antique,
wasn't it? But, oh, she understood.

00:46.358 --> 00:48.292
Hello. Statute of limitations.

00:48.326 --> 00:51.743
You know why? Because she is an
understanding, kind, and loving woman

00:51.777 --> 00:52.863
who loves you.

00:53.258 --> 00:53.991
That's cute.

00:54.026 --> 00:55.041
Yeah?

00:55.358 --> 00:56.182
Yeah.

00:56.216 --> 00:59.692
I don't know if "cute" is what I'm going
for on an interview for a newspaper, but...

00:59.777 --> 01:01.892
Worked for Brenda Starr.
Worked for Lois Lane.

01:01.925 --> 01:04.711
So if I get a job as a journalist
in a comic strip, this is the one.

01:04.745 --> 01:08.250
Oh, do you remember when we used to
do road trips when you were little,

01:08.285 --> 01:09.712
- and we'd play "I spy"?
- Yeah.

01:09.747 --> 01:12.031
And you'd say,
"I spy something with four wheels."

01:12.068 --> 01:14.723
And I'd be like, "is it a cow?"
'Cause that's funny and fun.

01:14.757 --> 01:16.363
- Mom.
- Road trips are so fun.

01:16.398 --> 01:18.420
They are fun,
but I don't feel like I can go,

01:18.457 --> 01:20.820
especially with Logan
freaking out on me right now.

01:20.857 --> 01:23.453
He's running off to Vegas,
coming home drunk, giving me attitude,

01:23.485 --> 01:25.021
- not calling his dad back.
- Still?

01:25.057 --> 01:27.073
Yes, and while I'm mad at him,
because he's acting this way,

01:27.107 --> 01:29.953
I just feel like he's going through
something and I should be there for him.

01:29.985 --> 01:32.613
Oh, honey, I get it.
I really do.

01:32.757 --> 01:35.620
You know, I want to take back the
"cute." That's really growing on me.

01:35.657 --> 01:37.283
- It's very you.
- Really?

01:37.315 --> 01:40.393
Yeah, it's very grown-up.
It reeks of gravitas.

01:40.427 --> 01:42.022
It screams New York Times.

01:42.055 --> 01:44.232
Well, I need it to say more than that.
I'm hoping to hear

01:44.265 --> 01:47.690
from the San Francisco Chronicle, the
Seattle Times, the Detroit Free Press.

01:47.726 --> 01:50.010
Well, honey,
you can't ask one suit to say so much.

01:50.045 --> 01:52.602
Why don't you just get the suit
that says something local?

01:53.068 --> 01:55.593
'Cause those other cities are
so far away, so expensive,

01:55.627 --> 01:56.783
- so tiring.
- I know.

01:56.818 --> 02:00.163
And plus, you know you can get a
good cup of coffee in New York.

02:00.195 --> 02:03.340
I don't know about those other cities.
They have crappy coffee.

02:03.377 --> 02:04.633
You mean like Seattle?

02:04.668 --> 02:06.821
Oh! Waffle Ranch.

02:06.858 --> 02:07.932
Missing the connection.

02:07.965 --> 02:09.850
Gosh, I drove through
North Carolina once,

02:09.884 --> 02:12.850
and they have the most wonderful
chain called "Waffle Ranch."

02:12.885 --> 02:15.930
Mom, it's not so much
about the road-trip food.

02:15.968 --> 02:18.190
Waffle Ranch kicks Ihop's butt.

02:18.626 --> 02:20.820
How come you weren't so
desperate to have me come along

02:20.838 --> 02:22.890
when we got the invitation
two months ago?

02:22.925 --> 02:25.503
Because two months ago,
I knew you would play the homework card,

02:25.537 --> 02:28.443
so I planned to do this road-trip
with your dad -- just him and me.

02:28.575 --> 02:29.703
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:30.998 --> 02:34.092
Are you sorry enough to make
it up to me by going with me?

02:34.125 --> 02:35.451
I really wish I could.

02:36.228 --> 02:37.721
- Hey, that's a winner.
- Really?

02:37.757 --> 02:40.093
Yeah, I think you could stun
them in any newspaper interview.

02:40.125 --> 02:42.573
- It is a stunning suit, isn't it?
- Yep. It sure is.

02:42.608 --> 02:44.980
They might like you so much
that they take your picture

02:45.016 --> 02:47.133
and put it in the insert
for the macy's one day sale.

02:47.155 --> 02:48.502
- You really like it?
- I really do.

02:48.538 --> 02:50.862
But you shouldn't take my word for it.
You need a group. A consensus.

02:50.897 --> 02:53.251
There would be a great
group at Mia's wedding.

02:53.285 --> 02:55.001
- Nice try.
- Oh, god.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:49.096 --> 03:50.193
Hey, you're up.

03:50.288 --> 03:51.720
The shower woke me.

03:51.805 --> 03:53.573
Sorry. I'm heading
over to the library.

03:53.607 --> 03:56.641
I have a ton of reading to catch up on.
So I thought I'd get an early start.

03:56.678 --> 03:58.490
- Cool.
- You doing some work?

03:58.528 --> 04:00.973
No, just looking for
something on Youtube.

04:03.717 --> 04:06.722
You got to see this. Finn posted
a video he shot on his cellphone

04:06.756 --> 04:09.081
when we were in Vegas.
It's pretty outrageous.

04:09.167 --> 04:10.922
You going in to
the office today?

04:10.956 --> 04:12.731
I doubt it.
Colin and Finn are coming over.

04:12.766 --> 04:14.123
What are you guys gonna do?

04:14.245 --> 04:15.841
Hang, probably.

04:16.777 --> 04:18.382
You know, Logan,
I think after the library,

04:18.416 --> 04:20.581
I'm gonna catch a train
back to New Haven.

04:20.615 --> 04:21.880
Good enough.

04:30.068 --> 04:31.751
- Oh, hi.
- Rory.

04:31.787 --> 04:33.053
Um, Logan's...

04:37.265 --> 04:38.813
So, it does work.

04:39.146 --> 04:42.692
And I can assume you can get cellphone
reception wherever the hell you've been.

04:42.726 --> 04:44.082
I was gonna call.

04:44.257 --> 04:46.333
I was just waiting until I
figured out my next move.

04:46.365 --> 04:49.123
Next move. I'm fascinated, Logan.
What is this next move?

04:49.157 --> 04:52.142
And where were you figuring it out --
by the pool, the slot machines?

04:52.177 --> 04:54.013
- You've been spying on me?
- After what you pulled,

04:54.047 --> 04:56.610
you can bet I'm gonna be spying
on you for the rest of your life.

04:56.648 --> 04:58.032
- I need some time.
- You know what you need, Logan?

04:58.066 --> 05:00.931
You need to get dressed, get cleaned up,
and get your ass down to the office

05:00.968 --> 05:03.210
so you can hear what's
been figured out for you!

05:03.247 --> 05:04.962
I'm not just another
one of your employees.

05:04.968 --> 05:06.213
Damn right you're not.

05:06.247 --> 05:08.723
If you were just another one of my
employees, you'd be fired by now.

05:08.755 --> 05:11.142
Steven, Barry and Legal
are gonna sit you down,

05:11.178 --> 05:13.032
try and sort out
the mess you made.

05:13.066 --> 05:14.681
Can you be there in an hour?

05:23.607 --> 05:27.373
And there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
Mitchum Huntzberger, class-A jerk.

05:27.408 --> 05:28.272
Can you believe him?

05:28.306 --> 05:29.133
No.

05:29.168 --> 05:30.300
I mean...

05:30.717 --> 05:33.602
- What?
- He was a jerk. He is a jerk.

05:33.635 --> 05:34.721
But?

05:35.258 --> 05:38.421
Uh, well, Logan, far be it for
me to agree with your father,

05:38.457 --> 05:41.990
but you have been kind
of irresponsible.

05:42.025 --> 05:45.240
Okay, you know what?
This is really weird.

05:45.276 --> 05:46.510
What -- that I'm being honest?

05:46.545 --> 05:49.701
No, that you're on his side. I kind
of expected a little support here.

05:49.738 --> 05:52.160
Logan, I love you,
but I'm not gonna support

05:52.197 --> 05:54.182
every stupid thing
that you do, okay?

05:54.216 --> 05:56.330
If you go rob a bank,
what do you expect me to do?

05:56.366 --> 05:59.081
Say, "oh, that's okay, honey.
I support you, darling"?

05:59.117 --> 06:01.760
I screwed up. I admit it. What do you
people want -- a freaking pound of flesh?

06:01.795 --> 06:03.142
What -- "you people"?

06:03.178 --> 06:06.490
Logan, for me, it's not that your
business deal got messed up, okay?

06:06.528 --> 06:07.772
It's what you've
done since then.

06:07.805 --> 06:09.621
- What have I done?
- Nothing.

06:09.656 --> 06:13.321
That's exactly my point.
You've not been facing the problem.

06:13.358 --> 06:15.633
- You've been running from it.
- I was going crazy, Rory.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.133
I had to blow off steam.
I'm trying to get my bearings here.

06:18.167 --> 06:21.302
I don't see you trying to get your
bearings. I see you hiding out,

06:21.336 --> 06:23.721
and people are counting on you,
your dad included.

06:23.756 --> 06:26.591
And you're not facing your
responsibilities. You're --

06:26.628 --> 06:29.443
- You are being a jerk.
- Well, maybe that's who I am.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.360
Maybe I'm a jerk like my dad.
You ever think of that?

06:31.396 --> 06:32.940
I'm starting to.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.813
I highly recommend the
cream of wheat today, ma'am.

06:40.845 --> 06:43.593
I don't know what it's spiked with,
but it's insane.

06:45.208 --> 06:48.380
We got a truckload of that cream of wheat
back there, so I'm pushing it like crazy.

06:48.414 --> 06:50.270
You're one sly waiter, Zach.

06:50.399 --> 06:53.468
Not so fast.
Got a little snafu with my order.

06:53.491 --> 06:54.524
I don't see a snafu.

06:54.559 --> 06:56.753
And that is why Lane is
the pro at this job,

06:56.788 --> 06:58.452
and you will always
be the amateur.

06:58.486 --> 07:00.741
Dude, I don't have a problem with that.
What's wrong with the order?

07:00.776 --> 07:03.310
Grilled-cheese platter comes
with french fries and pickles.

07:03.348 --> 07:05.300
- Which I'm looking at.
- Look a little closer, my friend,

07:05.335 --> 07:07.532
and you'll see that the
juice from the pickles

07:07.567 --> 07:09.422
has leached over to
the grilled cheese,

07:09.455 --> 07:11.482
rendering it sodden
and inedible.

07:11.515 --> 07:14.191
I don't recall ordering
grilled cheese au jus.

07:14.227 --> 07:16.562
Pickles have juice, dude.
It's like a main law of nature.

07:16.598 --> 07:20.250
Ah, but that's where Lane knew how to
prevent this culinary catastrophe.

07:20.287 --> 07:24.392
Prior to serving the dish, she would use
the french fries to build a tiny dam --

07:24.426 --> 07:25.863
Dude, I get it.

07:25.896 --> 07:27.530
It's all going to
the same place

07:27.566 --> 07:30.151
inside that dark,
strange body of yours, Kirk.

07:30.188 --> 07:31.450
Now eat it.

07:35.315 --> 07:37.392
Lane's right.
You rock as a boss.

07:37.427 --> 07:38.490
Yeah. How's she doing?

07:38.526 --> 07:40.352
Dude, she is about
ready to burst.

07:40.387 --> 07:41.253
Oh, yeah?

07:41.286 --> 07:43.621
Yeah, she's like a giant piñata,
just waiting for some kid

07:43.655 --> 07:46.232
to take a mallet to her stomach
and free the goodies inside.

07:46.265 --> 07:48.280
I'm thinking a doctor might
be a better way to go.

07:48.318 --> 07:49.762
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

07:49.797 --> 07:51.491
Lane and I would like to
have you over for dinner.

07:51.526 --> 07:53.520
Oh, yeah, that sounds great.
We should do that.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.251
Great. So,
how's tomorrow, 8:30?

07:55.285 --> 07:58.190
- Tomorrow? I don't know.
- Here's the thing --

07:58.226 --> 08:01.500
Lane asked me to ask you about tomorrow
a long time ago, and I kind of forgot,

08:01.537 --> 08:03.562
so she'd be mad if you
canceled last minute.

08:03.596 --> 08:05.302
I'm not canceling --
I haven't accepted.

08:05.335 --> 08:08.180
Let's not get into semantics.
It would be a bummer if you bailed.

08:08.217 --> 08:10.181
'Cause she's been cooking
for like two days.

08:10.218 --> 08:12.820
Okay, yeah, tomorrow night --
that sounds fine.

08:12.855 --> 08:15.730
Great! And I hope you like curry,
'cause Lane's gone curry crazy.

08:15.766 --> 08:17.282
I'm not big on curry.

08:17.317 --> 08:19.681
Oh, well,
maybe you can pick around it.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.940
See, it's the same program as the
one we used for that corporate stuff

08:24.975 --> 08:27.521
but a different application.
It's personal. It's simple.

08:27.558 --> 08:30.522
For you, maybe. I couldn't figure it out.
And your father was absolutely no help.

08:30.557 --> 08:33.121
All we need to do is --
mom, you're doing it again.

08:33.155 --> 08:34.422
I'm looking at the screen.

08:34.457 --> 08:36.610
I know, but you're,
like, hovering.

08:36.648 --> 08:39.480
I'm not hovering, Lorelai. "Hovering"
means you're elevated off the ground.

08:39.517 --> 08:40.919
Do I look like I'm elevating?

08:40.957 --> 08:43.162
- You seem awful tense, mom.
- Of course I'm tense.

08:43.198 --> 08:46.390
Having your father around the house
all the time is extremely difficult.

08:46.427 --> 08:49.630
He's just there, wandering about,
like a man of leisure.

08:49.666 --> 08:52.002
Did he go through any of this stuff?
Did he at least sign the 1040?

08:52.036 --> 08:53.313
I don't know.

08:53.348 --> 08:56.131
Mom, he has to sign some of this
stuff before we can send it out.

08:56.168 --> 08:57.823
He refuses to deal
with anything.

08:57.858 --> 09:00.373
All he does is watch golf,
pad around in his sweatsuit,

09:00.405 --> 09:02.890
and annoy me with questions
about things he's misplaced.

09:02.925 --> 09:05.233
He's getting to be a serious
pain in the you-know-what.

09:05.265 --> 09:06.640
The nose? The ear?

09:06.676 --> 09:08.963
Would it give you that much
pleasure to hear me say "ass"?

09:08.997 --> 09:10.383
I wasn't sure,
but, yes, it did.

09:10.415 --> 09:11.691
Emily!

09:12.066 --> 09:14.311
Have you seen my --
Oh, hello, Lorelai.

09:14.345 --> 09:17.260
Hi, dad. Nice threads.
Having lunch with Tony Soprano?

09:17.297 --> 09:18.461
Don't encourage him.

09:18.498 --> 09:19.583
You like it?

09:19.616 --> 09:22.882
I realized that, since I was housebound,
I might as well wear whatever I like.

09:22.916 --> 09:24.043
These are so comfy.

09:24.077 --> 09:25.810
Have either of you
seen my putter?

09:25.846 --> 09:28.320
No, but we have seen this 1040 tax form.
Sign it.

09:28.358 --> 09:31.062
Did your mother tell you that I've
installed a putting green in the backyard?

09:31.095 --> 09:31.770
It's great fun.

09:31.806 --> 09:34.141
You are not going out to putt.
You'll catch your death.

09:34.177 --> 09:36.032
And, Richard,
would you please sign this form?

09:36.066 --> 09:38.012
Just leave the form.
I'll sign it later.

09:38.047 --> 09:40.501
What are you doing down there?
The putter's not down there.

09:40.536 --> 09:42.930
No, but your tax form's here.
Come on, dad. Sign it.

09:42.968 --> 09:44.892
Fine, fine, fine,
fine, fine, fine.

09:46.317 --> 09:48.510
And, yes! There it is.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.093
Hallelujah, we
found the putter.

09:50.126 --> 09:51.993
We have a few more things we
need to go over with you.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.261
Later today, dear.

09:53.297 --> 09:56.272
You always say that, but you never do.
And wear a hat!

09:56.307 --> 09:57.630
Yes, mother.

09:58.447 --> 10:01.103
Well, mom, he was watching golf.
Now he's playing golf.

10:01.136 --> 10:02.402
That's progress.

10:02.437 --> 10:04.391
- Hey, kid.
- I'm in.

10:04.427 --> 10:05.501
You're robbing a bank?

10:05.537 --> 10:07.682
The road trip --
I'm going with you to Mia's wedding.

10:07.715 --> 10:09.961
Wow, that's great!
Are you sure?

10:09.996 --> 10:12.382
Yes, I so need to get away.

10:12.415 --> 10:13.743
I just had a huge
fight with Logan.

10:13.775 --> 10:14.941
Oh, sweetie, why?

10:14.976 --> 10:17.661
Because he's being a complete jerk.
He won't deal with anything.

10:17.696 --> 10:19.453
And Mitchum just showed
up at the apartment.

10:19.487 --> 10:20.980
- Mitchum came?
- I opened the door,

10:21.015 --> 10:24.071
and there he was in a really
expensive coat and all this cologne.

10:24.108 --> 10:26.353
And he yelled at Logan,
and Logan yelled back at him.

10:26.385 --> 10:30.151
And, yes, Mitchum is a jerk, but I
agreed with him, and I told Logan that.

10:30.185 --> 10:32.662
Wow, you agreed with the
boyfriend's dad? That's brave.

10:32.697 --> 10:35.011
I couldn't help it, mom.
Logan is being immature.

10:35.047 --> 10:37.722
And I can't focus on my work, and I
just really need to get out of here.

10:37.758 --> 10:40.002
Honey, it sounds like a trip
like this is just what you need.

10:40.037 --> 10:41.590
- A trip like what?
- Nothing, mom.

10:41.626 --> 10:44.331
- Are you with grandma?
- Yes, it's our thursday computer lesson.

10:44.365 --> 10:46.010
And it's no
"Tuesdays With Morrie."

10:46.047 --> 10:47.380
Where are you
going on this trip?

10:47.417 --> 10:49.162
Mia Halloway's wedding --
Charlotte, North Carolina.

10:49.195 --> 10:51.443
- I have to be back by monday.
- That'll be no problem.

10:51.478 --> 10:53.412
- This is gonna be a blast!
- Charlotte.

10:53.445 --> 10:56.221
Mia wanted me to do a toast,
and I thought I could do a poem,

10:56.258 --> 10:58.822
like you used to do for her when you
were a kid, so you have to help me.

10:58.857 --> 11:01.791
Kiki Saltberry just came back
from a spa in Charlotte.

11:01.826 --> 11:05.330
It's the Valentine resort, I think she
said, and she came back looking radiant.

11:05.368 --> 11:06.820
What is grandma
saying about a spa?

11:06.855 --> 11:10.120
We're staying at a Best Western, mom.
No spa facilities there.

11:10.156 --> 11:13.342
So, okay, I'll pick you up at the crack
of dawn. We'll cram everything in the jeep.

11:13.376 --> 11:15.051
No bathroom breaks
along the way, okay?

11:15.086 --> 11:17.351
- Does grandma want to come?
- No. I mean, yes, but, no.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.761
I'd have to rearrange my schedule,
but that can be done.

11:19.795 --> 11:21.522
Mom, you really can't
leave dad all alone.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.052
Alone, yes, completely alone,

11:23.088 --> 11:25.220
with two maids, a cook,
and a nurse who comes daily.

11:25.257 --> 11:27.271
Yes, grandma should come, too.
It'll be a hoot.

11:27.306 --> 11:29.552
It would be fun, honey,
but grandma's real busy.

11:29.588 --> 11:31.371
- Rory wants me to come?
- Well...

11:31.407 --> 11:34.320
Well, she'll be graduating soon,
and I won't have many more opportunities

11:34.346 --> 11:35.891
to spend time with her.

11:35.927 --> 11:38.251
This is perfect.
I'm gonna start packing.

11:38.286 --> 11:39.273
Oh, mom.

11:39.306 --> 11:41.142
Oh, and we'll take my car.
I have no intention

11:41.145 --> 11:44.041
of driving 800 miles
in an army vehicle.

11:44.698 --> 11:45.872
Shotgun?

11:51.506 --> 11:54.711
Mom, if you're gonna go this slowly,
you should really put your hazards on.

11:54.748 --> 11:58.422
Excuse me, but after I almost
got that ridiculous DWI,

11:58.457 --> 12:00.423
I can ill afford
a speeding ticket.

12:00.457 --> 12:02.732
And a Jaguar is an invitation
to be pulled over.

12:02.766 --> 12:05.503
Right, if you're speeding.
You're driving like you're in a parade.

12:05.536 --> 12:06.570
Oh, hush.

12:06.606 --> 12:09.410
Mom, seriously, by the time we get
there, the wedding will be over.

12:09.447 --> 12:10.770
The guests will have gone home.

12:10.808 --> 12:15.042
North Carolina will be under a sea
of water from melting ice caps.

12:15.075 --> 12:17.042
- "See ya."
- Huh?

12:17.078 --> 12:18.730
You could rhyme
"Mia" with "see ya."

12:18.765 --> 12:20.760
Oh, that's good. Or "be ya."

12:20.798 --> 12:21.450
Yeah.

12:21.485 --> 12:23.222
You were such a peach,
dear Mia,

12:23.257 --> 12:26.042
when Rory grew up,
she wanted to be ya.

12:26.076 --> 12:28.201
Good. But do you think it
owes too much to yeats?

12:28.235 --> 12:30.183
Well, it needs some work,
but you try finding something

12:30.217 --> 12:32.433
to rhyme with "Howard"
besides "coward."

12:32.467 --> 12:34.831
Howard? She's marrying
a man named Howard?

12:34.866 --> 12:36.203
What's wrong with Howard?

12:36.238 --> 12:39.750
It's just, for me, it would be very
difficult if my husband was named Howard.

12:39.785 --> 12:40.542
Why?

12:40.576 --> 12:42.492
It's just not a noble name.

12:42.528 --> 12:46.040
I like noble male names, strong --
John, Peter.

12:46.078 --> 12:46.922
Richard.

12:46.957 --> 12:49.193
Exactly. Richard
the lion-heart.

12:49.318 --> 12:51.903
Well, I guess name nobility
wasn't high on Mia's list.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.782
Howard the lion-heart.

12:55.297 --> 12:56.233
What are you doing?

12:56.267 --> 12:57.340
It's stuffy.

12:57.376 --> 12:59.053
It's too cold to have
the window open.

12:59.086 --> 13:01.173
Mom, just let me have it down --
oh, my god.

13:01.205 --> 13:02.611
Lorelai, stop playing
with the window.

13:02.648 --> 13:06.181
I'm not playing. I just want it down.
And you're making it go --

13:06.217 --> 13:07.422
Are you kidding me?

13:07.455 --> 13:11.103
Plea-- mother, I'm putting it --
I'm putting it --

13:11.535 --> 13:13.683
Wha-- uh -- mom!

13:13.717 --> 13:16.703
It's called a child lock,
appropriately enough.

13:17.375 --> 13:19.982
So, Rory, what do you have
lined up postgraduation?

13:20.016 --> 13:22.910
Oh, I'm setting up interviews
at different newspapers --

13:22.947 --> 13:26.390
the Seattle Times, the Detroit Free
Press, San Francisco Chronicle.

13:26.425 --> 13:29.561
Well, I'm not sure about the Seattle
paper, and the Chronicle is dreadful,

13:29.607 --> 13:32.153
but the Detroit paper
is quite reputable.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.342
You know what else a reputable paper is?
The New York Times,

13:34.378 --> 13:36.252
the Boston Globe,
the Hartford Courant.

13:36.287 --> 13:38.532
Yes, and only a short drive
away from Stars Hollow.

13:38.568 --> 13:42.572
Oh, well, that never occurred to me,
but now that you mention it, yeah.

13:42.778 --> 13:46.442
So, how does Logan feel about the
possibility of your moving far away?

13:46.476 --> 13:47.673
I'm not sure.

13:47.707 --> 13:49.071
You're not sure?

13:49.107 --> 13:51.940
No. Things with Logan are...

13:52.148 --> 13:53.110
Are what?

13:53.625 --> 13:56.512
Uh, we're kind of going
through something.

13:56.548 --> 13:57.941
Aw, that's a shame.

13:57.978 --> 13:59.342
Such a nice young man.

13:59.396 --> 14:02.341
He was so thoughtful when your
grandfather was in the hospital.

14:02.375 --> 14:03.382
Yeah.

14:04.335 --> 14:05.803
Oh, hey, the skirf.

14:05.837 --> 14:07.852
- Oh, the skirf.
- What's a skirf?

14:07.887 --> 14:10.913
When Rory was really little, my first sewing
project was trying to make her a skirt.

14:10.948 --> 14:12.373
- It was a desaster.
- It was terrible.

14:12.407 --> 14:14.681
But Mia made me feel better by
putting it on Rory's head and saying

14:14.718 --> 14:16.583
I created something new,
called a skirf.

14:16.615 --> 14:17.702
Yeah.

14:17.998 --> 14:19.833
So, do we all like show tunes?

14:19.867 --> 14:23.322
I found this marvelous CD when
I took the car to be washed.

14:28.195 --> 14:31.573
And I was put on bed rest so the babies
wouldn't come out before my due date.

14:31.606 --> 14:34.422
And I look at the calendar, and I say
to Zach, "Zach, it's my due date."

14:34.458 --> 14:35.420
And I'm like, "so?"

14:35.457 --> 14:37.620
And I say,
"so now I want them to come out."

14:37.657 --> 14:40.013
And I go, "duh,
let's get out of bed."

14:40.727 --> 14:44.191
They can come out whenever they want,
as long as we've finished our meal...

14:45.958 --> 14:48.141
...which, by the way,
was terrific, Lane.

14:48.176 --> 14:49.483
- Thanks.
- Yeah, she had no problem

14:49.515 --> 14:52.051
switching to a different meal when
I told her about your curry issues.

14:52.085 --> 14:55.011
It's -- I just --
it's not really an issue.

14:55.445 --> 14:59.101
Again, look, sorry about the wine.
I totally spaced.

14:59.138 --> 15:02.803
I should have brought you something
sparkling, a fruity kind of a thing.

15:02.835 --> 15:07.022
No, it's okay. Besides, they say one of
the things you can do to help induce labor

15:07.056 --> 15:08.220
is have a glass of wine.

15:08.257 --> 15:09.492
That or sex.

15:09.866 --> 15:11.693
Well, I can only help
you with the wine.

15:12.198 --> 15:15.300
So I should get going. I got to
get up early and open the diner.

15:15.335 --> 15:18.331
Are you sure you don't wanna stay
for dessert? Homemade peach pie.

15:18.365 --> 15:19.321
You made a peach pie?

15:19.358 --> 15:22.062
Well, actually,
you made it at the diner,

15:22.098 --> 15:24.853
which is technically your home,
but I paid for it, I swear.

15:24.888 --> 15:26.803
- I'll have one quick piece.
- Yes!

15:26.835 --> 15:28.662
This is really
nice of you guys.

15:28.698 --> 15:29.841
What do you expect, man?

15:29.877 --> 15:31.872
- You mean a lot to Lane and me.
- You do.

15:31.905 --> 15:35.092
We feel really close to you,
and not just, you know, employees.

15:35.127 --> 15:36.450
Yeah, uh, me too.

15:36.485 --> 15:39.461
When it comes to extended family,
Zach and I don't have much.

15:39.496 --> 15:41.563
I've got my mom,
but she's not so much a family member

15:41.597 --> 15:43.151
as she is a probation officer.

15:43.187 --> 15:46.611
Yeah, and my old man ran off when
I was like 10. No note. No nothing.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.743
So I got the feeling he
didn't want me to follow him.

15:51.715 --> 15:53.772
So, you guys need
money or something?

15:56.487 --> 15:59.663
Lane and I would like you to
be godfather to our twins.

16:00.715 --> 16:03.293
Oh, really? Godfather?

16:03.328 --> 16:07.360
We just want to make sure we have a
strong parental person for our boys.

16:07.395 --> 16:08.360
Well...

16:08.395 --> 16:10.620
- There's no paperwork involved.
- Right. I just --

16:10.658 --> 16:13.843
- No notary public.
- No, I know. It's just...

16:19.605 --> 16:21.660
Yeah, okay, sure.

16:21.795 --> 16:24.013
Oh, man. That is so great.

16:24.046 --> 16:25.163
Up high.

16:25.937 --> 16:26.982
Come on.

16:27.127 --> 16:29.450
All right. Okay. There you go.

16:30.238 --> 16:34.482
No, are you listening? I've already
booked a swedish massage for 1:00.

16:34.518 --> 16:37.110
I want to know what
I can do at 2:30.

16:37.818 --> 16:39.912
Good lord, no. A watsu?

16:39.947 --> 16:41.922
Why would I want to
re-experience my own birth?

16:41.956 --> 16:43.340
I'll be back to
take your orders.

16:43.375 --> 16:45.551
- Big menus.
- Yeah, that's a good sign.

16:45.688 --> 16:47.410
Oh, I love when they show
pictures of the food.

16:47.445 --> 16:49.562
I would be upset if I was
that fried chicken, though.

16:49.585 --> 16:50.880
That picture makes
her look fat.

16:50.915 --> 16:54.412
Fine. Book me a salt scrub at 2:30.
Thank you.

16:55.967 --> 16:57.651
Where on earth are we?

16:57.688 --> 17:00.372
Well, mom, since you wouldn't let
us take you to a drive-through,

17:00.407 --> 17:04.421
we've come here to Winky's,
a fine eatery just off I-85.

17:04.555 --> 17:06.762
- Very down home.
- We ready here?

17:06.897 --> 17:10.520
Oh, uh, I'm only halfway through.
Don't tell me how it turns out.

17:10.837 --> 17:12.630
I smell cigarette smoke.

17:12.666 --> 17:14.960
This is one of those places that
still allows cigarettes, isn't it?

17:14.997 --> 17:17.663
Mom, if you'd prefer to wait in the car,
we can bring food to you there.

17:17.695 --> 17:20.410
That would be foolish. The reason why
I refused to go to the drive-through

17:20.444 --> 17:22.363
is because I won't
allow eating in my car.

17:22.396 --> 17:24.882
- Hey, they have lobster.
- Lobster for $12.95.

17:24.915 --> 17:26.410
How could you go wrong?
I'll have the lobster.

17:26.445 --> 17:28.802
See, you'll have lobster. I'll have
shrimp. We'll make it a seafood night.

17:28.838 --> 17:30.980
Seafood in a place like this --
very risky.

17:31.018 --> 17:33.010
And a hot dog.
A hot dog for the table.

17:33.048 --> 17:34.640
You'll go in on that with us,
won't you, mom?

17:34.677 --> 17:37.502
I'll have a turkey sandwich on
wheat and a glass of Chardonnay.

17:37.536 --> 17:38.883
That's the clear one.

17:38.918 --> 17:41.782
My name is Charlene.
Holler if you need something.

17:41.817 --> 17:43.971
Wow, huge case of
cakes behind you there.

17:44.006 --> 17:46.470
Ooh, yeah.
Winky's got a trophy case full of cakes.

17:46.506 --> 17:49.560
Hey, I bet Mia makes her triple-layered
german chocolate cake for her wedding,

17:49.598 --> 17:50.850
- don't you think?
- Probably.

17:50.887 --> 17:53.640
Mmm. Aromatherapy --
that's what I want.

17:53.797 --> 17:56.553
Are you sure you two won't join
me for something at the spa --

17:56.585 --> 17:58.952
facial, moroccan mud wrap?
My treat.

17:58.988 --> 18:01.660
Mother, we came here because we made
a commitment to go to a wedding,

18:01.696 --> 18:03.321
so that's what we're gonna do.

18:03.637 --> 18:04.670
Suit yourself.

18:04.838 --> 18:07.641
I need to use the facilities.
Wish me luck.

18:08.825 --> 18:11.323
I love it here.
And I'm totally gonna score a panda

18:11.355 --> 18:12.972
in that crane machine
on the way out.

18:13.006 --> 18:16.082
Mom, do you think we should dial back
the talk about Mia in front of grandma?

18:16.088 --> 18:19.383
I don't think she's thrilled to hear
about our surrogate mother/grandmother.

18:19.417 --> 18:21.671
She knew that Mia is
the reason for the trip.

18:21.707 --> 18:23.893
I think it's okay if
we talk about her.

18:23.926 --> 18:26.850
I know, but it seems to bother her.
And I thought, during this trip,

18:26.888 --> 18:29.541
we could do more mother/daughter,
daughter/daughter bonding.

18:29.578 --> 18:31.631
10 hours in the car not
enough bonding for you?

18:31.665 --> 18:34.640
I'm just worried about you guys.
What's gonna happen after I graduate?

18:34.676 --> 18:37.223
After you graduate?
That's when the party gets started.

18:37.256 --> 18:39.652
Yeah, I just --
I want you guys to remain close.

18:39.688 --> 18:41.521
- Close?
- Ish.

18:41.855 --> 18:44.940
Honey, your grandma and I have
a very complicated relationship,

18:44.976 --> 18:47.463
but we'll be fine.
I don't want you to worry.

18:47.497 --> 18:50.303
You go off and do your own thing.
I'm a grown-up.

18:50.335 --> 18:52.362
A grown-up who wears a bib.
Thank you.

18:53.965 --> 18:58.012
All righty. Looks like our choices
are "Hitch" or "The lake house."

18:58.048 --> 19:00.561
- I could use a laugh.
- All right, "The lake house" it is.

19:00.596 --> 19:01.943
Oh, my dress got wrinkled.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.611
Honey, just put it in
the shower with the steam

19:03.645 --> 19:05.503
if mom ever finishes
shellacking her face.

19:05.538 --> 19:08.490
I heard that, Lorelai.
I'm simply washing up.

19:08.696 --> 19:12.100
Mom, the resort is 20 minutes away.
Why do you have to wash up here?

19:12.138 --> 19:15.291
I can't very well arrive
at a luxurious resort

19:15.326 --> 19:18.453
smelling of bad shellfish and
covered with the grime of the road.

19:18.488 --> 19:20.851
"The road." Who are you --
Willie Nelson?

19:21.736 --> 19:22.630
Hello.

19:22.666 --> 19:25.890
Mia, how is the
blushing bride-to-be?

19:25.927 --> 19:28.371
Surprisingly calm,
but I've had two glasses of wine,

19:28.408 --> 19:30.920
So we'll see tomorrow
when the buzz wears off.

19:30.958 --> 19:32.712
- Oh, you'll do great.
- Hi, Mia.

19:32.748 --> 19:35.970
Oh, hi, Rory. I just wanted to
see if you got here all right.

19:35.996 --> 19:38.031
How's the motel?
Not too terrible, I hope.

19:38.065 --> 19:40.560
Oh, no, it's great.
We have two beds, sanitized cups,

19:40.598 --> 19:43.901
Keanu Reeves in his most touching
role to date. What could be better?

19:44.288 --> 19:45.771
Oh, grandma, hold on.

19:45.806 --> 19:47.363
Oh, Emily's with you?

19:47.398 --> 19:51.443
Oh, um, yeah, we picked her up
hitchhiking on her way to a rock festival.

19:51.476 --> 19:53.021
She's going to the
Valentine resort.

19:53.058 --> 19:55.571
Well, if Emily's here,
then she has to come to the wedding.

19:55.606 --> 19:59.300
No, that's okay. She's spending tomorrow
getting rubbed, wrapped, and scrubbed.

19:59.336 --> 20:01.102
Oh, no,
she's asking me to the wedding?

20:01.137 --> 20:02.131
No, no. It's okay.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.940
So the ceremony's at noon.
We'll be there around 11:30.

20:04.976 --> 20:08.192
Oh, please ask Emily to come.
We have plenty of food.

20:08.226 --> 20:10.590
Howard and I would be
thrilled to have her join us.

20:10.625 --> 20:12.232
In fact, I insist.

20:12.367 --> 20:16.270
That is so thoughtful of you, Mia,
and I am sure she would love to come.

20:16.308 --> 20:18.092
- Great. Now I have to go.
- No, you don't.

20:18.126 --> 20:19.832
It would be rude not to. Damn!

20:19.866 --> 20:22.053
She says she's delighted and
flattered that you asked.

20:22.087 --> 20:23.752
Oh, that's wonderful.

20:23.787 --> 20:26.570
I look forward to seeing
all three of you tomorrow.

20:26.608 --> 20:28.171
- Sleep well.
- You, too, Mia.

20:28.206 --> 20:29.222
- Bye.
- Bye.

20:29.257 --> 20:31.360
Well, I hope the resort will
let me change my times.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.413
I'll pick the two of you up at
11:00 sharp tomorrow. Be out front.

20:34.447 --> 20:37.040
Of course, I didn't bring a
thing to wear to a wedding.

20:37.356 --> 20:40.040
Luckily, they're going bohemian,
so it won't really matter.

20:43.566 --> 20:44.830
We're bonding.

20:45.057 --> 20:46.740
Oh, this could be a good thing.

20:46.877 --> 20:49.873
No, the only good thing is that
mom is gonna get to the resort

20:49.908 --> 20:53.081
still smelling like bad lobster,
'cause I left my doggie bag in her car.

21:11.977 --> 21:13.341
Hey. Everything okay?

21:13.377 --> 21:16.380
Great. Everything's --
Yeah. Great.

21:16.907 --> 21:18.611
You know I don't open
for another hour.

21:18.648 --> 21:21.030
Oh, no, I know, but last night when
you said you had to get up early,

21:21.065 --> 21:23.823
I realized it's time, maybe,
I come and help crank up the place.

21:23.858 --> 21:24.830
Okay.

21:29.877 --> 21:33.213
I actually love this time of day,
you know, real quiet.

21:36.275 --> 21:38.330
You know what's, like, amazing?

21:38.366 --> 21:40.800
How peaceful Stars Hollow
is at this time of day.

21:40.835 --> 21:42.980
It's, like, spooky peaceful.

21:43.236 --> 21:44.523
You ever notice that?

21:44.648 --> 21:48.920
I'm sorry. I really don't enjoy
talking this early in the morning.

21:48.957 --> 21:51.311
Oh, hey, copy that.
I'm right there with you.

21:56.678 --> 21:59.351
Now, Lane --
she loves to talk in the morning.

21:59.386 --> 22:02.412
Lots of morning chin music
with that one. Not me.

22:03.115 --> 22:06.190
I take not talking
over talking any day.

22:07.438 --> 22:08.992
- Ooh, awesome catch.
- Thanks.

22:09.027 --> 22:11.142
- Pretty obvious you played some ball.
- A little.

22:14.466 --> 22:16.453
I didn't really get
into sports much.

22:16.815 --> 22:20.980
My dad didn't do sports with me when I
was little, and then he, you know, split.

22:22.027 --> 22:23.533
Yeah, you said. That's too bad.

22:23.567 --> 22:24.613
Yeah.

22:24.968 --> 22:28.182
- What kind of music you into?
- I don't really listen to much music.

22:28.338 --> 22:32.330
If I'm driving around in my truck, I'll,
you know, maybe put on an oldies station.

22:32.365 --> 22:33.422
I like some motown.

22:33.456 --> 22:36.093
Oh dude, I know the perfect band for
you. You would so get off on them.

22:36.127 --> 22:39.163
They're young, but their sound is way
borrowed from those old guys from the '70s.

22:39.197 --> 22:41.190
Listen, I got to
fire up the stoves.

22:41.227 --> 22:43.323
Yeah, go, go. Fire 'em up.

22:43.355 --> 22:46.620
You know, I can't pay you any
extra 'cause you came in early.

22:46.655 --> 22:49.102
Oh, yeah, I know.
I just figure it's part of my job,

22:49.135 --> 22:51.902
and it's a chance
for us to hang out.

22:52.106 --> 22:55.323
Plus, you know... the quiet.

22:56.188 --> 22:57.162
Right.

23:01.965 --> 23:03.440
Lorelai, you didn't even knock.

23:03.476 --> 23:05.231
Well, that's okay.
Mia leaves the door open.

23:05.256 --> 23:06.693
She likes people to
just come on in.

23:06.726 --> 23:08.640
She's probably too busy to
greet everybody, grandma.

23:08.675 --> 23:11.523
Well, of course she is. She should
have someone greet people for her.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.352
Oh, look at all
these great pictures.

23:13.386 --> 23:15.101
Not everyone has a maid,
you know, mom.

23:15.137 --> 23:17.491
How hard is it to hire
a maid for the day?

23:17.526 --> 23:20.023
Well, last I checked, they didn't
have them at bed bath & beyond.

23:20.058 --> 23:22.391
Oh, this must be Howard.
Look. Here we are.

23:22.428 --> 23:25.802
So cute. That's the rug where you used
to spin around at the Independence Inn.

23:25.835 --> 23:28.431
I bet you threw up just seconds
after that picture was taken.

23:28.495 --> 23:31.743
Are we going in, or are we going to
watch the ceremony from the entryway?

23:31.776 --> 23:33.723
- Oh, you're here!
- Hi!

23:33.757 --> 23:36.111
- Hi!
- Hi!

23:37.228 --> 23:38.772
Did you find it all right?

23:38.806 --> 23:41.601
Yeah, mom's got the GPS. Apparently,
it's great if you know how to use it.

23:41.637 --> 23:43.702
Yeah, we saw a lot of your
neighborhood -- very nice.

23:43.735 --> 23:46.292
Oh, those damn GPS
drive me crazy.

23:46.327 --> 23:48.731
Whatever happened to asking
the guy at the gas station?

23:48.766 --> 23:49.980
Good question.

23:50.016 --> 23:53.531
Hello, Mia. Thank you so much for
inviting me to this special occasion.

23:53.566 --> 23:55.443
Emily, I'm so glad
you could be here.

23:55.478 --> 23:57.601
Well, let's go in.
Let's not just stand here.

23:57.637 --> 24:00.622
I know a wedding wasn't what you
had in mind when you came down here.

24:00.657 --> 24:03.830
What I had in mind was spending time with
my daughter and granddaughter, wherever.

24:03.865 --> 24:06.190
- Will you sign my guest book, please?
- Oh, certainly.

24:06.597 --> 24:10.062
I just feel so lucky to have all
the Gilmore ladies under one roof.

24:10.097 --> 24:12.312
Speaking of roofs,
you have a charming home.

24:12.348 --> 24:13.161
Oh, thank you.

24:13.198 --> 24:16.500
I'm always amazed at what good
taste can do with a small space.

24:16.536 --> 24:17.772
Oh, it is beautiful.

24:17.808 --> 24:19.711
Yeah, so many personal
touches everywhere.

24:19.748 --> 24:21.743
Thank you. I agree with Emily.
It's a small house,

24:21.776 --> 24:25.083
And it's made even smaller by Howard's
junk. But you know what they say --

24:25.117 --> 24:27.171
you marry a man,
you marry his junk. Howard.

24:27.206 --> 24:28.951
- Mia --
- Howard, Howard.

24:28.987 --> 24:31.572
This is Emily Gilmore,
the mother and grandmother

24:31.606 --> 24:33.753
of the famous Lorelai and Rory.

24:33.785 --> 24:34.783
Hi.

24:34.817 --> 24:36.553
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do?

24:36.588 --> 24:38.492
I thought you weren't supposed
to see the bride in her gown

24:38.528 --> 24:39.640
before you got married.

24:40.778 --> 24:43.850
Yeah, and if the bride sees a lizard
crossing the road, that's bad news, too.

24:43.877 --> 24:46.662
Oh, well, haven't seen a lizard,
but too late for the dress,

24:46.696 --> 24:48.243
- 'cause Howard zipped me up.
- Oh no.

24:48.276 --> 24:49.902
Where's the zip-up on
the bad-luck-o-meter?

24:49.935 --> 24:52.312
Not sure, but I'd throw some salt
over your shoulders. Just in case.

24:52.347 --> 24:53.843
I don't have any salt.
I might have some splenda.

24:53.875 --> 24:57.043
You are exactly as Mia described you --
you both are.

24:57.077 --> 24:59.602
And believe me,
she described you a lot.

24:59.636 --> 25:01.290
Well, I hope she left
out the bad stuff.

25:01.326 --> 25:02.670
There's no bad stuff.

25:02.705 --> 25:03.820
Lucky you.

25:05.737 --> 25:08.392
The sooner we get married,
the sooner we eat cake.

25:08.428 --> 25:09.831
Oh, honey, you're so romantic.

25:09.868 --> 25:12.913
Emily, could I just borrow the girls
for a quick touch-up in the powder room?

25:12.945 --> 25:14.862
- They're all yours.
- Oh, thanks.

25:14.895 --> 25:17.023
Okay, guys,
let's get me beautiful.

25:17.386 --> 25:18.913
Oh, thank you.

25:20.916 --> 25:22.781
Mia adores them.

25:22.817 --> 25:24.702
Yes, I know.

25:28.685 --> 25:31.022
Well, come in. Find a seat.

25:32.627 --> 25:34.261
The sofa will be fine.

25:35.376 --> 25:38.452
And so, a toast to you,
dear Mia.

25:38.487 --> 25:41.822
It makes us all so
glad to see ya...

25:41.927 --> 25:45.681
blissfully joined with dear,
good Howard.

25:45.715 --> 25:50.321
May your love last long,
like it's battery-powered.

25:51.797 --> 25:54.830
Rory and I wanted to do a poem for you,
because when Rory was little,

25:54.867 --> 25:57.143
she used to love
making up poems,

25:57.176 --> 26:00.971
and we would perform them for you,
and that was such a fun time.

26:02.807 --> 26:06.871
Uh, so, what I've realized
now is that you can get away

26:06.908 --> 26:09.951
with a lot of bad rhymes
when you're cute and 5.

26:09.987 --> 26:12.011
But we do want to say...

26:12.048 --> 26:14.871
Excuse-me, would you mind terribly
getting me a glass of water?

26:14.908 --> 26:18.101
...the best things in life are worth waiting
for, even if they take a long time...

26:18.136 --> 26:19.813
She keeps her house very dry.

26:19.846 --> 26:21.290
So, let's...

26:22.347 --> 26:24.221
A toast to you.

26:24.258 --> 26:26.280
We love you so much. Cheers.

26:26.315 --> 26:28.330
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

26:28.367 --> 26:29.863
Congratulations.

26:30.736 --> 26:32.102
Thank you.

26:32.438 --> 26:34.243
That was wonderful.

26:34.975 --> 26:36.132
Are you Rory?

26:36.166 --> 26:37.722
There's someone
here to see you.

26:37.757 --> 26:39.331
...that you are here today.

26:39.366 --> 26:42.872
And thank you for those of
you who came from so far away.

26:43.808 --> 26:45.583
Thank you again for the toast.

26:45.615 --> 26:48.150
I'll thank my sister for
all the wonderful help...

26:48.185 --> 26:49.280
Hey.

26:49.317 --> 26:50.512
What the hell are
you doing here?

26:50.545 --> 26:53.003
I'm sorry. I don't mean to crash this.
I just need to talk to you.

26:53.037 --> 26:54.950
- How did you know where I was?
- I called Paris.

26:54.966 --> 26:57.380
She found the invitation. I kept trying
your cell, but you didn't pick up.

26:57.417 --> 26:59.411
Well, that's the
advantage of caller I.D.

26:59.448 --> 27:01.673
- I get it. You're still mad.
- No kidding.

27:01.705 --> 27:04.722
I'm here, so you have to talk to me --
the advantage of showing up in person.

27:04.755 --> 27:08.162
Wow, I can't believe you're still doing
this. This is so last year's Logan.

27:08.195 --> 27:08.792
What?

27:08.815 --> 27:11.381
You think you can just fly
anywhere I am and overwhelm me

27:11.415 --> 27:13.112
by just showing up and --

27:13.147 --> 27:15.410
I'm just not impressed anymore
by your grand gestures.

27:15.447 --> 27:18.111
I'm not trying to impress you. I just
want to tell you what I've been thinking.

27:18.145 --> 27:20.231
- I don't care --
- And I wanted to see you.

27:20.266 --> 27:22.441
I'm in the middle of a wedding
celebration of a close friend.

27:22.476 --> 27:24.823
I don't have time to stand
here and listen to you explain

27:24.856 --> 27:26.380
your stupid immature behavior.

27:26.418 --> 27:27.690
If you would just
hear me out --

27:27.707 --> 27:30.033
No, you go blow
off steam in Vegas,

27:30.067 --> 27:32.121
you gamble away thousands of dollars,
you drink all night,

27:32.156 --> 27:35.323
and do god knows what else.
This is me blowing off steam.

27:35.656 --> 27:38.753
I'm sorry to interrupt, Rory,
but Mia wanted me to tell you

27:38.786 --> 27:40.293
- we're about to cut the cake.
- Okay.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.543
- Will your friend join us?
- Um, no, he can't stay.

27:42.575 --> 27:44.463
Yeah, I was just stopping by.
Thanks, anyway.

27:44.495 --> 27:45.871
Oh, okay.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.430
- Hey, girls.
- Hey, there.

27:53.496 --> 27:54.682
Talk to me, Zach.
What do you got?

27:54.718 --> 27:57.790
Okay, bowl of chili, two dogs,
one BLT, shepherd's pie,

27:57.825 --> 27:59.151
and a mushroom soup.

27:59.185 --> 28:02.081
And those guys in the corner were asking
me if I had a pack of lucky strikes

28:02.117 --> 28:03.610
or a burger to spare.
What's that about?

28:03.645 --> 28:06.431
Bowling humor -- strikes, spares.
Never gets old, guys.

28:06.466 --> 28:08.500
Oh, I totally missed it.

28:08.576 --> 28:09.982
- Oh, man!
- What's wrong?

28:10.017 --> 28:13.182
Last night, I made this mix of tunes
that I thought would be right up your alley.

28:13.215 --> 28:13.993
Okay.

28:14.028 --> 28:16.700
Well, you know, new stuff that
sounds kind of classic rock-y --

28:16.735 --> 28:18.782
my morning jacket,
who are like Neil Young reborn,

28:18.816 --> 28:20.741
if Neil would have,
you know, died.

28:20.777 --> 28:23.353
Wolfmother -- definitely
channeling Zeppelin -- modern,

28:23.388 --> 28:25.831
but not so much that it would
freak out somebody of your taste.

28:25.867 --> 28:26.860
- The point?
- The point is,

28:26.897 --> 28:29.072
- I totally forgot to bring it.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

28:29.108 --> 28:31.333
- Yeah, but I spent all night on it.
- That's nice.

28:31.365 --> 28:33.483
Gave me something to do
instead of sitting around,

28:33.518 --> 28:35.152
waiting for Lane to
pop out the babies.

28:35.186 --> 28:36.061
It'll happen.

28:36.097 --> 28:37.841
Yeah, don't I know it?

28:38.228 --> 28:40.341
Denver omelet, steak sandwich.

28:40.375 --> 28:42.521
Two cheeseburgers --
medium and well.

28:42.558 --> 28:45.483
- Question -- circumcision, yes or no?
- Pardon?

28:45.516 --> 28:47.290
We have to make a decision as
soon as the boys are born,

28:47.327 --> 28:49.053
and I'm really on
the fence about it.

28:49.226 --> 28:51.770
I thought about having Mrs.
Kim weigh in, but her opinion would be

28:51.808 --> 28:55.172
kind of hypothetical 'cause she doesn't
have the goods, as far as I know.

28:55.308 --> 28:58.401
Right, so, you being a guy, I figured
I could use your input on this.

28:58.438 --> 29:01.631
You know, something like this -- it's
kind of personal between you and Lane,

29:01.667 --> 29:05.163
- so go with your gut.
- Yeah, okay. Cool.

29:05.525 --> 29:06.743
Bill, refill?

29:06.908 --> 29:10.051
Let's say your kid falls out of a
tree and majorly gashes his head.

29:10.088 --> 29:12.722
Do you run to him right away or
just let him kind of shake it off?

29:12.727 --> 29:14.423
I don't want to be a wussy dad,
but --

29:14.456 --> 29:17.680
Probably not the right time to be talking
about gashed heads and circumcisions.

29:17.715 --> 29:20.780
Right. Right.
I totally get that.

29:21.675 --> 29:24.890
Maybe we could, uh, go over to
Casey's after work and grab a beer

29:24.926 --> 29:26.403
- and talk about some stuff.
- Look, I-I can't be --

29:26.438 --> 29:28.552
- Please.
- Okay.

29:30.796 --> 29:32.560
Listen, I know what's
going on, okay?

29:32.597 --> 29:34.391
You're about to become a father,
so you're panicking.

29:34.426 --> 29:35.672
I am, dude, big-time.

29:35.707 --> 29:37.073
Promise you you'll
get through this.

29:37.105 --> 29:38.550
I don't know how to
throw a damn frisbee.

29:38.586 --> 29:39.913
Don't worry about it, okay?

29:39.946 --> 29:42.632
I really could use your help
on all this father stuff

29:42.665 --> 29:44.401
- that I know nothing about.
- Zach --

29:44.436 --> 29:47.593
What the hell are they supposed to
call me -- "dad," "pop," "papa"?

29:47.628 --> 29:50.143
- Do I look like a papa to you?
- It'll come to you eventually.

29:50.175 --> 29:53.151
Papa is a big, cuddly guy from
Italy with all this dark hair.

29:53.187 --> 29:54.240
That's so not me.

29:54.275 --> 29:56.753
Listen, the first time
April turned up in my life,

29:56.785 --> 30:00.412
I didn't know squat about being a
father, but eventually, it came to me.

30:00.446 --> 30:03.090
I found my dad mode,
and you will, too.

30:03.128 --> 30:05.380
- Dude, I hope so.
- Yeah. Don't sweat it.

30:05.418 --> 30:09.512
Go ahead and deliver these to the clowns
in the corner over there. You will be fine.

30:10.998 --> 30:13.110
I -- Okay, all right.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.502
- Guy's a real goofball, huh?
- Yeah, watch it, Bill.

30:15.536 --> 30:17.723
- I'm not finished with that pie.
- Yeah, you are.

30:19.386 --> 30:21.752
And I drove through
Connecticut once -- beautiful.

30:21.787 --> 30:24.953
In fact, Cathy and I considered moving
to New England 'cause we love the foliage.

30:24.986 --> 30:27.422
Well, we got a lot of that.
It practically grows on trees.

30:27.457 --> 30:30.213
But the cold -- no thank you.
I can barely handle it here in Charlotte

30:30.248 --> 30:31.803
when it drops below 40.

30:31.838 --> 30:33.841
Cathy says it's a
circulation thing.

30:33.877 --> 30:36.383
I think it's a matter of not having
the fat layer that you women do.

30:36.416 --> 30:37.750
You should be glad
you don't have it.

30:37.785 --> 30:40.003
If you did, you couldn't wear
such an amazing sweater.

30:40.036 --> 30:43.433
Hey, Mia put out some of her famous
mini cream puffs. They're delicious.

30:43.465 --> 30:45.863
Uh-oh, may have to get
me one of those. Scusie.

30:46.598 --> 30:48.410
- God bless you.
- No problem.

30:48.445 --> 30:49.941
- You looked a little trapped there.
- No, no.

30:49.978 --> 30:52.422
I was riveted by stories
of foliage and fat.

30:52.456 --> 30:54.772
- Where'd you go off to?
- Logan showed up.

30:54.807 --> 30:56.253
- What?!
- Yeah.

30:56.317 --> 30:58.913
- Where is he?
- Outside, leaning against a car.

30:58.947 --> 31:00.483
Why? You wouldn't
let him come in?

31:00.516 --> 31:01.111
No.

31:01.147 --> 31:02.691
Really? Look at you,
all tough love.

31:02.726 --> 31:05.911
I'm still mad at him. I'm not gonna melt
just because he flies here to see me.

31:05.946 --> 31:08.241
If we're gonna do this,
it's gonna be on my terms.

31:08.278 --> 31:09.223
Wow.

31:09.257 --> 31:11.762
It doesn't look like grandma's
having a good time, is she?

31:11.796 --> 31:14.482
No, grandma's staging a sit-in,
as only grandma could do,

31:14.517 --> 31:17.042
in the middle of a hoopla.
Some people would call it a shindig.

31:17.077 --> 31:18.110
I'm here to tell
you it's a hoopla.

31:18.146 --> 31:19.872
I have so much to
learn from you still.

31:20.067 --> 31:24.672
Ladies, I'm striking out left and right
in my attempts to coax someone to dance.

31:24.707 --> 31:26.871
Would either of you
salvage my pride?

31:26.905 --> 31:28.062
Howard, I'll dance with you.

31:28.097 --> 31:29.072
Thank you.

31:29.108 --> 31:30.332
Talk to grandma.

31:35.445 --> 31:36.862
Hi, mom. How are you doing?

31:36.895 --> 31:39.211
Oh, fine. I'm just going through
my schedule for the week.

31:39.247 --> 31:40.781
So, did Howard
ask you to dance?

31:40.817 --> 31:42.702
He did, yes -- very thoughtful.

31:42.736 --> 31:44.131
Why didn't you dance with him?

31:44.165 --> 31:46.281
I don't feel like
dancing right now.

31:46.315 --> 31:49.703
Besides, I have no idea how
one dances to cowboy music.

31:49.738 --> 31:52.540
You want to dance with me? We could
slap our knees, shout "yee-haw."

31:52.635 --> 31:54.903
No thank you. I think I'll just
wait for the appropriate moment

31:54.938 --> 31:56.482
to excuse myself gracefully.

31:56.516 --> 31:58.893
Mom, I told you I didn't think
you were gonna want to come.

31:58.926 --> 32:02.392
So, Lorelai, gal,
we have got to do some catching up.

32:02.427 --> 32:03.660
How have you been, sweetie?

32:03.696 --> 32:04.960
Good, Donna. Good.

32:04.998 --> 32:08.051
Mia says you have you own inn.
That is so far out.

32:08.086 --> 32:10.641
It is great.
Um, mom, this is Donna.

32:10.675 --> 32:12.783
This is my mother,
Emily Gilmore.

32:12.818 --> 32:14.780
- How do you do?
- Really well, thank you.

32:14.817 --> 32:17.150
Donna and I were maids together
at the Independence Inn.

32:17.186 --> 32:18.790
A few hundred lives ago, huh?

32:18.827 --> 32:21.111
Hey, listen,
your toast was so great.

32:21.145 --> 32:23.023
Thanks. I didn't know I
was gonna be the only one.

32:23.058 --> 32:24.440
Oh, but you were
the perfect choice.

32:24.478 --> 32:27.203
I mean, for god's sake,
Mia was like a mother to you.

32:27.537 --> 32:29.420
Um, so, how are you?
You look good.

32:29.456 --> 32:30.752
- I do, don't I?
- Yeah.

32:30.788 --> 32:33.583
I tell you, six years ago, when I
first started the raw-foods thing --

32:33.605 --> 32:35.700
Do you know if they
put the coffee out yet?

32:35.737 --> 32:37.343
- Mother.
- What?

32:37.377 --> 32:40.383
I'm sorry, but you're talking about
something between the two of you,

32:40.418 --> 32:42.322
and I could really
use a cup of coffee.

32:42.357 --> 32:44.972
You know what? I am having a
serious craving for herbal tea.

32:45.007 --> 32:46.862
Let's get something
together, Emily.

32:46.895 --> 32:48.283
All right.

33:00.158 --> 33:01.471
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:01.505 --> 33:03.902
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. It's fine.

33:03.936 --> 33:06.621
I just always seem to forget my
mother doesn't play well with others.

33:06.655 --> 33:09.142
Oh, I think she's doing
all right, considering.

33:09.178 --> 33:10.162
Considering...

33:10.197 --> 33:13.823
I mean, in terms of you and
me and Rory and our history.

33:13.855 --> 33:15.463
Yeah, so? We have a history.

33:15.497 --> 33:18.422
Seeing me with both of you must
bring back very painful memories.

33:18.457 --> 33:21.622
Imagine how difficult it must have
been for your mother to lose you.

33:21.658 --> 33:24.742
She didn't lose me.
I embarrassed her, so I had to leave.

33:24.775 --> 33:26.702
But Lorelai,
even in the best of circumstances,

33:26.737 --> 33:29.353
you never want to think that your
child doesn't need you anymore.

33:29.388 --> 33:31.542
She just wanted me out of the
house so she didn't have to explain

33:31.576 --> 33:33.760
why my school uniform
didn't fit anymore.

33:33.795 --> 33:36.710
That's not the impression I
got when she came to see me.

33:36.748 --> 33:40.023
What? When did she
come to see you?

33:40.058 --> 33:41.890
Oh, must have been five years ago,
when I came back

33:41.925 --> 33:44.062
for that visit to Stars Hollow.

33:44.096 --> 33:45.652
She came and found
me at the inn.

33:45.688 --> 33:47.521
- Why?
- I think she wanted to meet me.

33:47.558 --> 33:49.843
And she asked me to send
her photos of you and Rory

33:49.875 --> 33:51.972
from those years when
you were staying with me.

33:52.007 --> 33:53.130
She never told you?

33:53.168 --> 33:55.081
No, she definitely
never told me.

33:55.117 --> 33:57.552
Well, my dear,
my dancing feet are all warmed up.

33:57.587 --> 33:59.770
- Your turn.
- Oh, goody, the dance.

33:59.808 --> 34:02.543
Now we find out if we're
really meant to be together.

34:13.607 --> 34:15.132
You didn't have
to bring me cake.

34:15.166 --> 34:16.431
I didn't.

34:19.688 --> 34:22.230
You wanted to talk, so talk.

34:23.996 --> 34:26.731
All I wanted to do
was say I'm sorry,

34:27.534 --> 34:31.292
so... I'm sorry. You were right.
I was being immature.

34:31.328 --> 34:32.431
Okay.

34:33.795 --> 34:35.833
When the whole
deal fell apart...

34:37.427 --> 34:41.042
I knew I was in so much trouble,
I just -- I totally lost it.

34:41.078 --> 34:43.810
I couldn't face anything.

34:44.074 --> 34:48.141
I had so much invested in it in every
way that, when it all collapsed,

34:48.178 --> 34:51.791
it was like I fell into this hole
I couldn't pull myself out of.

34:52.858 --> 34:56.080
And I also realized that my dad was right.
He had every reason to be pissed at me.

34:56.117 --> 34:58.713
I mean,
I would have fired me for what I did.

35:00.486 --> 35:05.391
So, I decided the only way to fix this
is to not be my dad's employee anymore.

35:05.568 --> 35:06.451
What?

35:06.485 --> 35:08.593
I went to him, and I just --
I said --

35:08.625 --> 35:12.873
I was calm, apologetic,
no shouting, no threats.

35:12.905 --> 35:16.031
I just said I didn't want to be a pawn
in whatever game he had in mind for me.

35:16.067 --> 35:16.903
Really?

35:16.936 --> 35:19.701
I am officially not working for
the Huntzberger Group anymore.

35:19.737 --> 35:20.662
Oh, my god.

35:20.696 --> 35:23.250
Yeah, and it feels really good.

35:23.288 --> 35:26.570
I mean, it felt great finally
standing up to my dad.

35:26.607 --> 35:27.981
How did he take it?

35:28.017 --> 35:30.192
He tried to put up this cool,
detached front,

35:30.226 --> 35:33.103
but I think I actually saw
steam coming out of his ears.

35:33.666 --> 35:35.701
Basically, he told
me to hit the road.

35:35.738 --> 35:37.280
And you took him literally.

35:37.416 --> 35:39.621
I just needed to see you.

35:42.805 --> 35:45.650
The thing is,
even though he was mad, I swear I saw

35:45.687 --> 35:50.802
the slightest glimmer of pride
in his eyes, just for a second.

35:50.836 --> 35:54.131
I mean,
no one walks out on Mitchum Huntzberger.

35:55.406 --> 35:56.931
I'm proud of you, too.

35:58.086 --> 36:00.880
I almost wish I'd saved
you a bite of cake.

36:07.187 --> 36:08.312
Boyfriend?

36:09.247 --> 36:10.231
Yes.

36:10.268 --> 36:11.573
He came with you?

36:11.605 --> 36:13.961
No, I guess he flew
down to see Rory.

36:13.995 --> 36:16.980
It's hard for me to think of
little Rory with a boyfriend.

36:17.016 --> 36:19.353
- She's not so little anymore.
- No.

36:19.628 --> 36:21.890
I just hope she doesn't
get her heart broken.

36:21.926 --> 36:25.481
I can assure you, if anyone does
any heartbreaking, it will be Rory.

36:25.515 --> 36:27.373
- Probably.
- Definitely.

36:27.528 --> 36:31.133
She's such a smart, confident young
woman. She's really amazing --

36:31.167 --> 36:32.421
witty, charming,

36:32.455 --> 36:36.182
valedictorian in high school,
editor of the college paper.

36:36.215 --> 36:39.491
Sounds like she'll have her pick of jobs
at newspapers all over the country.

36:39.746 --> 36:41.370
Rory will be fine.

36:41.406 --> 36:43.393
Well, you would know.

36:43.868 --> 36:44.923
Hey.

36:45.095 --> 36:46.233
Here you go.

36:46.457 --> 36:49.123
Well, we should probably get going,
let Mia and Howard do

36:49.158 --> 36:51.040
whatever it is they're gonna
do the rest of the night.

36:51.075 --> 36:53.031
- Lorelai.
- What? That could mean anything.

36:53.065 --> 36:55.393
Well, she's right.
The bride and groom have wild plans

36:55.428 --> 36:57.903
to take off all their clothes,
jump into their pajamas,

36:57.935 --> 36:59.810
and listen to "A
prairie home companion."

36:59.846 --> 37:01.260
See? Dirty mind -- you.

37:01.297 --> 37:04.092
I can't tell you how much it meant
for me to have you here. Thank you.

37:04.116 --> 37:06.632
Oh, you kidding?
I wouldn't have missed it.

37:06.665 --> 37:09.470
Mia, best wishes to you.
It was a lovely wedding.

37:09.506 --> 37:10.581
Thank you...

37:10.615 --> 37:11.920
For everything.

37:11.957 --> 37:13.622
It was my pleasure.

37:20.885 --> 37:22.092
Bill is asking for
seconds on his pie --

37:22.125 --> 37:23.712
something about how you
owe him from earlier.

37:23.745 --> 37:25.021
Sure, give it to him.

37:25.055 --> 37:27.742
Look, man, I'm really sorry
about the way I've been acting --

37:27.776 --> 37:29.823
leaning on you for
all this father stuff.

37:29.857 --> 37:31.041
Don't worry about it.

37:31.077 --> 37:33.790
No, I was just all bent out of shape
about being a perfect father --

37:33.805 --> 37:35.982
like there is such a thing.
And I was so freaking nervous,

37:36.015 --> 37:38.082
I'm like, "hey,
maybe Luke can take up the slack."

37:38.115 --> 37:39.743
Hey, if I can help out, I will.

37:39.775 --> 37:42.152
No, but I dig what you
said about the dad mode --

37:42.188 --> 37:44.470
makes perfect sense.
I'm really psyched to feel it kick in.

37:44.507 --> 37:45.840
- Okay, good.
- Totally.

37:45.878 --> 37:48.561
Oh, I almost forgot.
This is the CD.

37:48.598 --> 37:49.791
Oh, great.

37:49.825 --> 37:52.862
Yeah, I listed the band names on the
back. You don't have to listen to it.

37:52.896 --> 37:54.201
No, I want to hear it.

37:54.615 --> 37:55.900
Luke's diner.

37:55.936 --> 37:58.182
Who knows,
maybe I'll really get into Wolfmother.

37:58.216 --> 38:00.360
Okay, okay. Do not move.

38:00.398 --> 38:02.292
I'll be right there.
Don't move.

38:03.386 --> 38:05.571
I have to go.
Lane's water broke.

38:06.608 --> 38:08.423
I need my... coat.

38:08.506 --> 38:10.430
I-I don't --
I don't need my coat.

38:10.465 --> 38:11.750
My keys are in my coat.

38:11.785 --> 38:13.781
That's it. We're closed, folks.
I'm driving.

38:13.815 --> 38:16.382
- No, no, no, man. I can do this.
- Zach, Zach, Zach, Zach.

38:16.416 --> 38:19.371
Dad mode doesn't have to
kick in right now. Let's go.

38:19.408 --> 38:21.323
Last one out, lock the door,
turn off the lights.

38:21.357 --> 38:22.051
What about my --

38:22.088 --> 38:23.793
Just take the whole
damn pie, Bill.

38:27.348 --> 38:28.951
So, he's really not
working for his dad?

38:28.986 --> 38:29.863
No, he's out of there.

38:29.876 --> 38:31.601
Well, it's probably
the best thing for him.

38:31.638 --> 38:33.711
How did he feel about you
sending him back to New York?

38:33.747 --> 38:37.281
Um, I think he was okay with it. I told
him it was an all-girls road trip.

38:37.317 --> 38:40.452
Exactly. No boys allowed,
except for that male stripper we hired.

38:40.486 --> 38:41.560
Well, good night.

38:41.597 --> 38:42.981
Oh, grandma,
aren't you coming in?

38:43.018 --> 38:44.653
No, I just wanted to
walk you to your room,

38:44.688 --> 38:47.040
seeing as this isn't the
safest of neighborhoods.

38:47.077 --> 38:49.672
Mom, now I feel like I should
walk you back to the car

38:49.705 --> 38:52.622
and then you're gonna walk me back and
then we'll be stuck in a terrible loop

38:52.656 --> 38:54.353
and neither of us is
wearing the shoes for that.

38:54.388 --> 38:55.571
Oh, grandma, you should stay.

38:55.606 --> 38:58.462
We're gonna get junk food from the
vending machine, and watch a movie.

38:58.495 --> 39:00.003
Come on. Don't you like dots?

39:00.037 --> 39:01.221
Hey, get some Little Debbie.

39:01.258 --> 39:03.162
Seriously, Rory, I can't stay.

39:03.196 --> 39:05.582
Too late, grandma.
I'm already getting you a little debbie.

39:11.427 --> 39:12.992
Oh, I bought her a suit.

39:13.216 --> 39:14.231
Did you?

39:14.265 --> 39:16.161
Yeah. It was so fun.

39:16.197 --> 39:18.850
It was weird, you know,
but we found something really great,

39:18.885 --> 39:21.531
and it just felt like
a rite of passage.

39:21.566 --> 39:22.880
I'm sure.

39:25.117 --> 39:28.071
Made me imagine, you know,
what it's gonna be like

39:28.847 --> 39:30.430
after she leaves.

39:31.305 --> 39:32.313
Of course.

39:33.417 --> 39:36.261
It's gonna be hard
to be without her.

39:39.407 --> 39:41.382
Well, I'm sure you'll
get through it.

39:43.005 --> 39:46.031
What I mean to say is, mom,
I know that it was hard for you.

39:52.968 --> 39:54.830
Have you seen "The
pursuit of happyness"?

39:56.767 --> 39:58.573
Is that the one
with Will Smith?

39:58.608 --> 39:59.740
He's so attractive.

39:59.777 --> 40:01.670
Mmm! Mom has a thing
for Will Smith.

40:01.707 --> 40:03.722
I don't have a thing for him.
Is it on now?

40:03.755 --> 40:04.601
Yeah.

40:06.098 --> 40:09.493
Oh, my god!
Lane had her babies.

40:10.417 --> 40:12.882
Zach just sent me
a photo. Here.

40:13.167 --> 40:15.591
- Oh, cute!
- Aren't they cute?

40:15.625 --> 40:18.100
I'm sure that little camera
distorts their faces.

40:18.135 --> 40:19.971
What do you mean, mom?
They're cute.

40:20.005 --> 40:21.060
Here's another one.

40:21.096 --> 40:23.373
Oh, sweet.

40:23.406 --> 40:25.002
Why did they
misspell "happyness"?

40:25.035 --> 40:26.372
we'll find out.

40:29.245 --> 40:30.781
There's your boyfriend, mom.

40:30.826 --> 40:32.040
- Who?
- He's not my boyfriend.

40:32.078 --> 40:34.010
- Will Smith. Mom has a thing for him.
- You like Will Smith?

40:34.045 --> 40:36.612
- I think that he's very charming.
- That's all right.
