WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.194
They come by
with a car

00:02.268 --> 00:03.860
and I break it down
to its component parts.

00:03.937 --> 00:05.700
They need it
turned around...
Chop shop.

00:05.772 --> 00:07.137
You'll make more money
in two months

00:07.207 --> 00:08.469
than you could
in two years.

00:08.541 --> 00:09.940
I sure didn't
see you coming.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.807
I didn't see you
coming either.

00:11.878 --> 00:14.779
I can refer you to
the adoption agency.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.372
What if I Don't want
to have the baby?

00:16.449 --> 00:19.782
You provided this girl
the information
to get her child aborted.

00:19.853 --> 00:20.842
I did not, ma'am.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.883
Get out of here!

00:24.090 --> 00:25.114
Go!

00:25.191 --> 00:26.715
Calvin's dead.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:44.644 --> 00:47.579
Bill, now do you see
what we're concerned
about out here?

00:47.647 --> 00:49.638
We've got 18, 19 more holes
all throughout this field.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.514
Not to mention
all the glass That's in it.

00:52.652 --> 00:55.951
Bill, there's
a pothole over there
on the 35-yard line.

00:56.022 --> 00:57.353
You drive your car
over it,

00:57.424 --> 01:00.154
hell, you're going to pop
your hubcap right off.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.217
Yeah, when
you're driving around
on the football field.

01:02.295 --> 01:04.286
We usually Don't
drive around on
our football field.

01:04.364 --> 01:05.626
I'm not going to put
my players at risk

01:05.698 --> 01:06.995
just because they can't
maintain their field.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.227
We got... We got
playoffs coming up.

01:08.301 --> 01:09.700
We've been playing
on this field all year

01:09.769 --> 01:12.135
and not one Lion
has fallen from the pride.

01:12.205 --> 01:13.604
Yeah,
and remember, Joe,

01:13.673 --> 01:16.039
you've got to
win Friday night
to make the playoffs.

01:16.109 --> 01:17.974
You've got to
win first, Joe.
You got to win.

01:18.044 --> 01:20.069
Did I hear the voice
of a dead Panther?

01:21.214 --> 01:23.842
You know, Coach,
you really ought to consider
investing in some turf.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.077
They have
a legitimate concern here.

01:25.151 --> 01:26.675
Exactly.
Very much so.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.482
Let me recommend
something.
Hmm?

01:28.555 --> 01:30.682
It's simple. How about
a neutral field?

01:30.757 --> 01:31.849
That's
a very good idea.

01:33.893 --> 01:35.952
Hey, hey, how about
Joe's backyard?

01:36.029 --> 01:37.087
...ours, we're not
playing on yours...

01:40.800 --> 01:42.665
We can look
into a neutral site!

01:42.735 --> 01:43.759
We can look
into a neutral site!

01:43.837 --> 01:45.634
Hey! Hey!

01:45.939 --> 01:47.964
I'm the conference
director here.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.373
The decision is on me.
All right?

01:53.413 --> 01:55.973
Coach, you feel like
you got a handle on this?

01:56.049 --> 01:58.882
Bill, It's Saturday.
The game's Friday.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.681
I can promise you
this field will be

02:00.753 --> 02:03.017
in fine shape
for play by then.

02:04.023 --> 02:07.186
All right.
All right, gentlemen,
we're adjourned.

02:07.594 --> 02:10.426
Y'all know where
the parking lot is, Coach.

02:11.931 --> 02:13.558
Mom, It's a one-month
training program.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.260
They house you,
they feed you,

02:15.335 --> 02:17.530
they bring in amazing
people to speak.

02:17.604 --> 02:19.094
And Jimmy Carter's
part of Habitat.

02:19.172 --> 02:21.197
I know who
Jimmy Carter is, honey.

02:21.274 --> 02:23.401
Well, do they know
how old you are?

02:23.476 --> 02:25.376
'Cause I think
that could be
an issue for you.

02:25.445 --> 02:27.777
Well, by the time
I'm completely done
with the training program,

02:27.847 --> 02:29.246
I'll be 18.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.976
And normally
they Don't make
this kind of offer

02:31.050 --> 02:33.518
to somebody of my age,
but I wrote a really
amazing essay.

02:33.586 --> 02:36.419
I have prior
work experience,
great recommendations.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.720
All right, where, when,
how long and how much?

02:40.426 --> 02:44.590
Um, it'll be in New Orleans
in about three weeks.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.524
What? Honey, no.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.431
Mom, It's only $3,000.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.470
Only?
Honey, you're hilarious.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.301
Half of it they'll pick up
with grant money

02:53.373 --> 02:56.433
and I have $500
saved up and...
Yeah.

02:56.509 --> 02:57.567
...if I pass
my government class,

02:57.644 --> 02:59.202
I can graduate
this semester

02:59.279 --> 03:01.804
and next semester
I was only going to
take electives anyways.

03:01.881 --> 03:04.008
No, no, no and no.

03:04.083 --> 03:06.483
I think It's wonderful
that you like Habitat
for Humanity so much.

03:06.553 --> 03:07.611
You're finishing
school, period.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.314
You haven't even
looked at any
of the brochures, Mom.

03:09.389 --> 03:11.220
I need your help.
Would you please
go grab those things

03:11.291 --> 03:14.522
and start working
on that stove, please?
Thank you.

03:21.134 --> 03:22.931
Oh, hey, little man.

03:23.469 --> 03:25.664
Hey, buddy.
Come on up.

03:26.539 --> 03:27.528
Good boy.

03:27.607 --> 03:29.074
I brought you
your dog back.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.700
I can see that.

03:31.644 --> 03:33.373
Mom hates him
even more now.

03:33.446 --> 03:35.311
She says he reminds
her of you.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.576
I'll take that
as a compliment.

03:37.650 --> 03:39.914
I think That's
how she meant it.

03:39.986 --> 03:41.010
Right.

03:41.087 --> 03:42.918
I brought you your stuff.

03:44.023 --> 03:45.456
My mom threw it out.
My stuff, huh?

03:45.525 --> 03:46.856
Well, that was
nice of her.

03:46.926 --> 03:47.984
she's mad.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.121
Never pictured you as
a snow globe kind of guy.

03:52.532 --> 03:54.523
My mom gave me that one.

03:58.671 --> 04:00.434
I've got to get that.

04:00.506 --> 04:01.632
Yeah.

04:05.278 --> 04:06.267
Riggins' Rigs.

04:06.379 --> 04:07.368
Billy!
It's due day!
The baby's coming.

04:07.447 --> 04:08.471
The baby's on its way!

04:08.548 --> 04:09.674
Who the hell are you
talking to?

04:09.749 --> 04:10.841
It's Tim.
You want to talk to him?

04:10.917 --> 04:12.214
No, I don't...
We practiced this.

04:12.285 --> 04:15.254
The for real D-day?
she's gonna pop, or what?

04:15.321 --> 04:16.583
Like, for real.
Oh, my God, Billy!

04:16.656 --> 04:17.644
The baby might even come
this minute.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.351
Oh, my God!
Hang up the phone and
take me to the hospital.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.551
I got to go.
Where are my keys?

04:20.627 --> 04:21.992
All right.

04:24.497 --> 04:26.021
What is it?
Oh.

04:26.532 --> 04:28.056
I'm going to become
an uncle today.

04:28.134 --> 04:29.192
Right now?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.861
Yeah, right now.
I got to go.
You need to go.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.234
I've got to
put my pants on!

04:32.305 --> 04:33.704
I Don't care
about your pants!

04:33.773 --> 04:36.537
Mindy! Mindy,
you can't drive right now.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.509
My boots.
there's my pants.

04:38.578 --> 04:40.910
Coming!
Mindy, wait, wait, wait!

04:46.019 --> 04:47.179
Mindy!

04:47.987 --> 04:49.113
Yeah.

05:21.921 --> 05:24.116
I wish he would've been
more like you, Vince.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.214
No.

05:25.491 --> 05:28.119
I wish he would've
stayed on the team.

05:28.761 --> 05:32.060
It just happened.
I'm sorry.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.600
I am sorry.

05:35.668 --> 05:38.000
He loved you.
He loved all of us.

05:41.441 --> 05:43.466
That's my baby.

05:48.114 --> 05:50.105
You speak
to the cops yet?

05:51.918 --> 05:54.614
Jess, if I go to the cops,
I go to jail.

05:55.788 --> 05:57.915
I Don't see
my mom no more.

05:57.990 --> 06:00.322
I Don't see her
get better. Nothing.

06:00.393 --> 06:01.792
Vince, you were
in the car.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.022
You did not do
a thing wrong.

06:04.630 --> 06:05.824
doesn't> matter.

06:05.898 --> 06:08.093
Look, I know I laid
a lot on you last night.

06:08.167 --> 06:10.727
That was wrong of me,
I shouldn't have done that.
That was stupid.

06:10.803 --> 06:14.068
No, no, no, no, no.
Look, I'm glad
you came to me.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.173
I've got to trust you.

06:18.044 --> 06:21.207
You can't say nothing
to nobody about anything.

06:23.182 --> 06:24.774
You know I won't.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.057
I got to go.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.173
You getting
any heat on this?

06:48.241 --> 06:49.299
Nah.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.180
You ready for payback?

06:56.783 --> 06:58.045
I'm down.

08:03.082 --> 08:06.916
Four days from Thanksgiving
and five days from Armageddon.

08:06.986 --> 08:10.217
I'm talking
blue versus red,
west versus east,

08:10.289 --> 08:13.383
Panthers in the playoffs
or Taylor's revenge.

08:13.459 --> 08:15.324
Who's got something
to say out there?

08:15.394 --> 08:16.952
I've got
something to say, Sammy.

08:17.029 --> 08:19.827
I say that Eric Taylor
better enjoy his turkey
on Thursday

08:19.899 --> 08:21.992
'cause Friday's going to
be his comeuppance.

08:22.068 --> 08:23.433
He quit on
the Panthers twice.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.937
He quit on his own team
the first game
of the season.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.336
Stole that boy Cafferty
from us.

08:27.406 --> 08:28.805
Why Don't you
turn that stuff off?

08:28.875 --> 08:30.137
We should
already be in the playoffs.

08:30.209 --> 08:31.437
This game
shouldn't even matter.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.638
But it's all good
'cause he's...

08:36.082 --> 08:37.207
What?

08:55.434 --> 08:56.526
What?

09:04.243 --> 09:05.267
Hello?

09:05.344 --> 09:07.141
You're a baby killer,
Tami Taylor!

09:07.213 --> 09:08.305
Who is this?

09:08.381 --> 09:10.349
You're gonna burn in hell
for what you've done!

09:17.323 --> 09:18.585
Hey there, Jess.

09:18.658 --> 09:19.886
Landry?

09:20.760 --> 09:22.284
How's it going?

09:22.528 --> 09:23.586
Hey.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.292
Yeah, I've been
standing here for
about 20 minutes

09:30.369 --> 09:32.496
trying to
perfect this pose.

09:35.641 --> 09:36.665
I just didn't want
you to think

09:36.742 --> 09:39.074
that just because
of our scandalous romance,

09:39.145 --> 09:41.636
I had forgotten about
the debt that I owed you.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.545
So...
Uh-huh.

09:44.717 --> 09:45.809
Huh.

09:46.852 --> 09:48.752
That's not exactly the...

09:49.255 --> 09:51.052
The response
that I was looking for.

09:51.123 --> 09:52.750
It's great, It's great.
I'm sorry.

09:52.825 --> 09:54.122
You know,
my mind's just...

09:54.193 --> 09:57.128
We're going to
a church service
right now 'cause...

09:57.196 --> 09:59.994
You know Calvin Brown?
He got shot the other night.

10:00.066 --> 10:02.296
And you know, he died.

10:04.904 --> 10:07.702
Calvin Brown,
Vince's friend?
The one that...

10:07.773 --> 10:10.264
Yeah, yeah.
And so, I'm...

10:10.743 --> 10:12.370
You know, I'm just...
No, I'm sorry.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.810
That's not
the best timing.

10:13.879 --> 10:15.676
Thank you.
You should have shut me up
a long time ago.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.079
No, I'm sorry it...

10:17.149 --> 10:19.117
I'll bet you're Landry.

10:19.719 --> 10:21.050
Yes, ma'am.
How are you doing?

10:21.120 --> 10:23.350
Landry Clarke.
Good. I'm Bird.

10:23.589 --> 10:25.022
Pleased to meet you.
My aunt.

10:25.091 --> 10:27.150
You got a lock
for that bike?

10:27.226 --> 10:30.024
Uh, no, ma'am,
I do not. I didn't...

10:30.329 --> 10:32.991
she's going to
need a lock
for that bike.

10:33.099 --> 10:34.088
I've got to go.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.861
You're going to need
a lock for it.

10:35.935 --> 10:36.959
I should have thought
about that.

10:37.036 --> 10:38.367
Thank you.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.337
I... I'll call you.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.568
Okay.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.004
Okay.

10:52.752 --> 10:54.117
All right,
let's load this one up.

10:54.186 --> 10:56.177
Take it up to that spot.

10:56.288 --> 10:59.416
Come on,
we need some pressure.
We need some pressure.

11:00.926 --> 11:02.587
Hey, Coach.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.960
Coach Crowley said
we're going to practice
at Carroll Park this week?

11:05.031 --> 11:06.328
Yeah, everybody
except for you.

11:06.399 --> 11:09.664
Hey, Stan! Stan!
Where's Tim Riggins?

11:09.735 --> 11:11.930
His brother's
having a baby
with his wife.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.028
His brother's
having a baby...

11:13.105 --> 11:15.198
How come you know that
and I Don't know that?

11:15.274 --> 11:16.832
I left you a note
on your desk.

11:16.909 --> 11:17.967
This is going to be
a bad week.

11:18.044 --> 11:19.102
Don't leave notes
on my desk.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.271
You got something to say,
say it face to face,
would you, please?

11:21.347 --> 11:22.507
Face to face.
That'd be great.

11:22.581 --> 11:23.946
His brother's
having a baby.
Yeah. I understand.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.108
Thanks very much.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.208
What do you mean,
everybody except for me?

11:26.285 --> 11:28.150
Because of your hip,
That's what I mean.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.245
I'm fine, Coach,
I can play through.
I can gut it out.

11:30.322 --> 11:31.380
You know what?
You want to gut it out?

11:31.457 --> 11:33.516
Why Don't you
gut it out and fill up
the Gatorade jug?

11:33.592 --> 11:35.389
That'd be just fine.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.323
I want five!
Thanks, Coach.

11:37.396 --> 11:38.954
This looks great.
Five!

11:39.031 --> 11:41.625
This looks real good.
It's very smooth.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.895
Gonna like it.
Great.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.038
Hey, Luke. Come here.

11:59.318 --> 12:00.649
I'm sorry.

12:02.822 --> 12:03.880
Appreciate that.

12:03.956 --> 12:05.617
You know what?
As far as the work
I want you doing,

12:05.691 --> 12:06.680
I want you taking care
of your hip.

12:06.759 --> 12:09.353
That's it.
That's the only work
I want you doing.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.328
Hey, put that jug down.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.490
Appreciate that.
Thank you.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.062
All right, Coach.

12:16.135 --> 12:19.002
Just seems
like we're making
a bigger mess than...

12:19.071 --> 12:20.060
Yeah.

12:20.139 --> 12:21.401
Lance.
Run them down the end.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.465
Coach.
Fill that jug up.

12:23.542 --> 12:26.204
This place
is ridiculous!
When did you get here?

12:26.278 --> 12:27.836
What happened?
I'm going frigging nuts
in there!

12:27.913 --> 12:29.505
They threw me out.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.571
What do you mean
they threw you out?

12:30.649 --> 12:31.673
Nurse Ratched
threw me out.

12:31.751 --> 12:32.911
She said I was
too enthusiastic,

12:32.985 --> 12:34.179
whatever the hell
That's supposed to mean.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.016
What did Mindy say?

12:36.122 --> 12:37.248
Mindy said,
"Get the hell out. "

12:37.323 --> 12:39.416
Well, no, no, no,
Mindy screamed,
"Get the hell out. "

12:39.492 --> 12:41.323
It's ridiculous, man.
I got a baby being born.

12:41.393 --> 12:43.293
I can't even be inside
with him right now.

12:43.362 --> 12:44.761
I'm going nuts, Tim.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.764
And how many of those
have you drank?

12:46.832 --> 12:48.094
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

12:48.167 --> 12:49.361
Just answer
the question.
I Don't know, five?

12:49.435 --> 12:50.766
Five?
Yeah.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.261
Here, you're cut off.
Why?

12:53.873 --> 12:56.501
Because It's pure caffeine,
Billy, That's why.

12:56.575 --> 12:57.667
Fine.

13:01.147 --> 13:03.172
What? This Isn't
funny, Tim.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.411
let's go!
let's go!

13:05.484 --> 13:07.509
let's get
this chalk down.

13:07.820 --> 13:09.617
Come on.
Stay with me.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.118
let's go,
bring it in!

13:14.193 --> 13:15.319
What's up,
Coach?

13:15.394 --> 13:16.418
This is a baseball
field, man.

13:16.495 --> 13:19.123
A football field now.
let's go.

13:24.403 --> 13:27.895
Hey, Vince,
I'm sorry to hear
about your friend, Calvin.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.105
I know It's
got to be tough.

13:30.176 --> 13:33.509
What do you care for?
You didn't even know
his last name.

13:33.579 --> 13:37.310
Calvin Brown.
And I care about
my teammates,

13:37.783 --> 13:39.944
and you're
my teammate, so...

13:41.821 --> 13:43.584
Hey, Landry, thanks.

13:45.090 --> 13:47.923
All right,
bring it up!
Helmets on! let's go!

13:47.993 --> 13:49.017
let's go!

13:49.094 --> 13:50.425
All right, listen up,
this is the field

13:50.496 --> 13:52.623
we're going to
be using this week.
Understood?

13:52.998 --> 13:56.832
You pissed off?
I'm pissed off, too.
Good, use it.

13:57.136 --> 13:58.831
Hey, Coach,
What's this bull
I hear on the radio

13:58.904 --> 14:00.235
about them not
letting us use
our field on Friday?

14:00.306 --> 14:02.274
Don't worry about
the damn radio.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.706
Heard all that crap
before.

14:03.776 --> 14:06.540
Listen to me,
word of the week,

14:06.679 --> 14:07.941
focus.

14:08.747 --> 14:10.271
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.816
Is that understood?
Yes, sir!

14:11.884 --> 14:12.908
let's break it down!

14:16.589 --> 14:20.548
One, two, three,
four, five, six...

14:20.626 --> 14:22.594
Pay attention
to what we're doing.

14:22.661 --> 14:25.061
I ain't going to
have any knees left
for this Friday.

14:25.130 --> 14:26.222
Shut up, Twinker, man.

14:26.298 --> 14:27.492
If I can do this
with my hip,

14:27.566 --> 14:29.625
you can do it
with your knees.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.034
Yo, man, whose idea
was this anyway?

14:32.104 --> 14:34.095
Landry's.

14:34.406 --> 14:37.807
Yes. It was my idea.
Thank you very much
for pointing that out.

14:37.877 --> 14:38.866
And it was
a brilliant idea

14:38.944 --> 14:41.037
because if we can't
practice on our field

14:41.113 --> 14:42.410
then they're not going to
practice on their field.

14:42.481 --> 14:43.971
End of story.

14:50.389 --> 14:51.981
Hey, Paul.
Hey, Tami.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.524
How are you?
Just fine.

14:53.592 --> 14:54.650
Good.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.388
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

14:56.462 --> 14:57.451
Come on in.
Yeah, of course.

14:57.529 --> 14:58.553
No, it won't take
but a moment.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.496
Uh, okay.

15:00.666 --> 15:02.793
Shoot, I know you live
at least 50 miles away.

15:02.868 --> 15:04.096
It must be
something important.

15:04.169 --> 15:05.534
Well...
Can invite you
into my home.

15:05.604 --> 15:08.596
Well, I just wanted to
see how you're holding up.

15:08.674 --> 15:09.766
Well, thank you.

15:09.842 --> 15:12.811
It's not blowing over
like we hoped it would.

15:12.878 --> 15:14.470
You saw the articles.
You see them?
I don't... Yeah.

15:14.546 --> 15:15.911
We need to set
the record straight.

15:15.981 --> 15:18.142
We think you need
to make a statement.
The sooner, the better.

15:18.217 --> 15:20.048
I agree.
I think I should.

15:20.119 --> 15:22.178
I'd like to get
the facts out there.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.882
Good. Good.
Actually, It's part of
the reason I came over.

15:24.957 --> 15:27.016
The board, we spent
some time last night,

15:27.092 --> 15:29.390
a little overtime actually,
drawing up something for you.

15:29.461 --> 15:32.225
And we'd like you
to think about it,
if you would.

15:32.298 --> 15:34.232
We... We've lined up
a reporter who's friendly.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.665
he's going to
interview you.
Paul, this is an apology.

15:35.734 --> 15:37.361
We have
a friendly reporter That's
going to interview you.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.461
This is saying
"inappropriate conduct,"
Paul? That is inaccurate.

15:39.538 --> 15:41.870
The paper's going to
bury it in the
Thanksgiving Day edition.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.533
Paul...
The Panthers will be
in the playoffs

15:43.609 --> 15:44.598
and everyone's
going to be happy.

15:44.677 --> 15:45.701
Y'all are being bullied.
I'm being...

15:45.778 --> 15:48.076
And you'll get to
keep your job.

15:48.981 --> 15:50.972
I do live 50 miles away.

15:51.984 --> 15:54.851
The reason I drove here
is because I think you're
very good at what you do.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.911
I Don't want
to lose you.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.520
Well, I Don't want
to lose my job either, Paul.

16:00.592 --> 16:03.823
Look, I hope you take this
very seriously, okay?

16:03.896 --> 16:06.364
I know you'll make
the right decision.

16:06.432 --> 16:08.229
Give my best to Eric.

16:23.515 --> 16:25.312
This magazine sucks.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.423
I'm the dad, right?

16:36.795 --> 16:37.819
Yes, you are.

16:37.896 --> 16:40.626
And It's my baby That's
trying to, you know...

16:40.699 --> 16:43.190
To claw.
To claw his way out,

16:43.268 --> 16:44.826
or her way,
or whoever, but...
To claw.

16:44.903 --> 16:46.871
Its way out.
Its way out.

16:48.474 --> 16:49.634
Are you ready
to be an uncle?

16:49.708 --> 16:51.198
I've been waiting
38 hours for this.

16:51.276 --> 16:53.301
Yeah, you have.
All right.

16:53.812 --> 16:54.836
I'm going back in.

16:54.913 --> 16:56.813
Get in there.
I'm going.

16:57.049 --> 16:58.277
Sir.
I'm going in there.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.080
Sir.
You can't stop me.
I'm going back in!

17:01.387 --> 17:02.786
I'm the dad.

17:03.555 --> 17:04.852
I'm the dad.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.391
I'm the dad.

17:07.792 --> 17:09.192
I'm the dad.

17:11.195 --> 17:12.220
I'm the dad.

17:12.297 --> 17:13.320
I know, honey.
We got this under control.

17:13.398 --> 17:14.423
Billy, get out!

17:14.500 --> 17:16.262
I am the dad.
All right. All right.

17:16.335 --> 17:17.358
It's all right.
It's all right.

17:17.435 --> 17:20.233
Go. Help her breathe.
Help her breathe.

17:20.739 --> 17:22.569
Okay, baby,
just breathe.

17:23.142 --> 17:24.131
You know what
you're doing.

17:24.242 --> 17:28.509
Just breathe.
Just breathe.
Oh, God!

17:36.922 --> 17:38.822
Do you want a ride?
No.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.392
Listen to me,
I want you to
do me a favor.

17:44.463 --> 17:46.954
I want you to be easy
on your mother this week.

17:47.032 --> 17:48.124
Dad.
I want you to be

17:48.200 --> 17:49.189
easy on your mother
this week.

17:49.268 --> 17:50.428
It's going to
be a long one.

17:50.502 --> 17:52.299
You do this for me,
and what I'll do for you

17:52.371 --> 17:55.169
is we can talk about
this house building
or whatever.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.935
So, we got a deal?

17:57.676 --> 17:58.836
Deal.

18:00.746 --> 18:01.804
What are you going to
do about the car?

18:01.880 --> 18:04.781
I'm going to
clean the car.
You go to school.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.274
Go to school.

18:06.351 --> 18:07.579
Do you want some help?
Nope. I don't.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.018
You go to school.

18:09.988 --> 18:11.421
Sammy, that field
they play on

18:11.490 --> 18:12.923
don't have
near enough seats,

18:12.991 --> 18:15.459
and the neighborhood,
I'm going to
tell you the truth,

18:15.527 --> 18:17.927
I don't feel safe
taking my family
over there.

18:17.996 --> 18:20.260
You know, things
are just different
on that side of town.

18:20.332 --> 18:21.959
Now, now, caller,
hold on.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.831
There's a lot of good folks
over in East Dillon.

18:23.902 --> 18:25.699
I'm not saying
that ain't true,

18:25.771 --> 18:28.262
but I was told
they had gang members
on that team.

18:39.585 --> 18:41.052
Hey, why are
you stopping?

18:41.120 --> 18:42.610
Get out there!
let's go!

18:42.688 --> 18:43.712
Come on, guys!

18:43.789 --> 18:44.983
Coach!

18:53.966 --> 18:55.797
It's just toothpicks.

18:58.604 --> 18:59.628
Get it cleaned up.

18:59.705 --> 19:00.933
All right, boys,
let's spread out.

19:01.006 --> 19:03.031
let's get them
out of there one by one.

19:03.108 --> 19:04.302
Take them out.
let's go! let's go!

19:04.376 --> 19:06.571
We can't start
practice until we get
the field cleaned up!

19:06.645 --> 19:07.634
Crap!

19:07.713 --> 19:09.408
Get it out.
You all right?

19:10.916 --> 19:12.247
Anybody got
a toothpick?

19:15.921 --> 19:18.549
I understand it took
West Dillon two hours...

19:18.624 --> 19:20.023
Two hours
for West Dillon

19:20.092 --> 19:22.151
to pick all those toothpicks
out of that field.

19:22.227 --> 19:23.717
Anybody want to
share with me
who the genius was

19:23.795 --> 19:26.025
who came up with
this master plan?

19:26.098 --> 19:27.963
wasn't me, Coach.
I didn't do it.

19:30.469 --> 19:33.495
Lance, you look
a bit tired today.
How are you feeling?

19:33.572 --> 19:36.769
I feel great, Coach.
I'm ready for practice.

19:36.842 --> 19:37.934
Good.

19:38.610 --> 19:39.634
You know what
we're gonna do?

19:39.711 --> 19:40.905
We're gonna have
some fun today,
gentlemen.

19:42.247 --> 19:45.148
What we're going to do is,
we're going to let Lance
kick a 40-yarder.

19:45.217 --> 19:47.708
If he makes that,
we're going to
begin our practice.

19:47.786 --> 19:51.415
But until he does,
we're going to run
jingle jangles.

19:51.490 --> 19:52.787
Come on, man.

19:54.059 --> 19:56.152
let's go, right now.
Set it up. let's go.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.426
Come on, Lance.

20:05.404 --> 20:07.304
let's go, 2-1.

20:13.845 --> 20:15.335
Jingle jangle!

20:16.415 --> 20:17.973
It is a beautiful day.

20:19.751 --> 20:22.049
You know,
I mean, this wasn't
on school grounds,

20:22.120 --> 20:25.920
she's not my student,
and I followed district
protocol all the way.

20:25.991 --> 20:27.583
I'm not saying
you Don't have a case.

20:27.659 --> 20:28.683
Oh, okay. Good.

20:28.760 --> 20:29.784
Now, if you're telling me
the whole story,

20:29.861 --> 20:32.352
I think you've got
one hell of a wrongful
termination suit.

20:32.431 --> 20:33.830
Okay. They were
trying to tell me

20:33.899 --> 20:35.799
I've got to make
this big public apology.

20:35.867 --> 20:37.596
Look, you Don't need
to make an apology.

20:37.669 --> 20:38.727
I don't?

20:38.804 --> 20:42.240
No. But if you Don't
and they take your job,

20:42.307 --> 20:43.535
I'll file that in court.

20:43.609 --> 20:45.008
I got a pretty good idea
we'd win.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.442
Okay, good.

20:46.545 --> 20:47.876
But I want you to
know something, Tami,

20:47.946 --> 20:50.881
cases like this can drag out.
It could take a long time.

20:52.451 --> 20:53.748
Well, what do you mean?

20:53.819 --> 20:57.084
I mean, when you say
"long time,"
is that months or...

20:57.155 --> 20:58.816
It could take years.

20:58.957 --> 21:02.518
And It's possible
we can get you reinstated
at the end of it all,

21:02.594 --> 21:04.255
but I doubt that.

21:05.230 --> 21:07.164
And then while
the case is pending,
you're...

21:07.232 --> 21:08.927
let's face it,
you're gonna have
a hard time getting work

21:09.001 --> 21:12.027
as a high school principal
when this is going on.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.004
My record is exemplary.

21:14.573 --> 21:17.474
I understand that, Tami,
but there's law

21:17.776 --> 21:19.676
and there's life.

21:30.656 --> 21:32.180
Hey, Uncle Tim.

21:39.564 --> 21:40.758
Did he make it
through or what?

21:40.832 --> 21:42.595
You need to see
for yourself.

21:55.247 --> 21:56.578
It's a boy.

22:16.868 --> 22:19.701
This is
Steven Hannibal Riggins.

22:40.692 --> 22:44.389
Oh, what?
Come on, y'all.

22:46.098 --> 22:49.226
Come on, now.
Come on, now, y'all.

22:51.837 --> 22:53.964
No, come on, now!

23:11.923 --> 23:13.584
I mean, this has
gotten out of hand.

23:13.658 --> 23:16.320
Yeah. They ought to find
other things to do with
their time, shouldn't they?

23:16.395 --> 23:17.862
You would think so.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.588
Here, Grace.
Where's the meat?

23:20.665 --> 23:22.792
I Don't
cook flesh, Dad.

23:22.868 --> 23:25.166
Your daughter made dinner
'cause she knew
we needed the help.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.329
Thank you so, so much.

23:26.405 --> 23:29.306
You guys are just busy,
so I thought I'd help out.

23:29.608 --> 23:30.700
Oh. All right.

23:30.776 --> 23:32.403
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

23:33.812 --> 23:35.211
Hey, thank you.

23:36.448 --> 23:38.348
You're welcome.
That whole toothpick thing

23:38.417 --> 23:40.112
had everybody in
an uproar today.

23:40.185 --> 23:42.779
You know
kids will be kids.

23:42.854 --> 23:44.788
What'd the lawyer
have to say today?

23:46.591 --> 23:47.990
He had a lot to say.

23:48.059 --> 23:50.391
Well, I wasn't there.
What'd he say?

23:52.130 --> 23:54.325
I Don't know, honey.
Do we have to talk
about it at dinner?

23:54.399 --> 23:57.391
I'm just asking.
Did he say anything
about the statement?

23:57.469 --> 23:58.902
I need to talk to
somebody else.

23:58.970 --> 24:00.130
All right.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.347
Do you want me
to get that?

24:10.415 --> 24:12.383
I'll get it.
Thank you, honey.

24:16.021 --> 24:17.181
Hello?
Lions suck!

24:17.255 --> 24:19.314
Hey, you
know what? Go to hell.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.019
Well, y'all
want any of this?

24:22.494 --> 24:23.552
You still have some.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.152
This is brisket for your mom,
and That's for you.

24:25.230 --> 24:28.222
Hey, there.
I made this
for you. Here.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.098
Wait, so you... You're
giving me your iPod?

24:31.169 --> 24:33.694
Well, no, It's a loaner,
but I made you a playlist.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.333
You made me
a playlist, Jess?

24:37.409 --> 24:39.001
Yeah. I made you
a playlist.
Like a...

24:39.077 --> 24:40.806
It's for you
to practice.

24:40.879 --> 24:42.369
Slow jams on the mix?

24:46.384 --> 24:47.749
How you doing
on that grill?

24:47.819 --> 24:48.979
Everything's
going good, ma'am.

24:49.054 --> 24:50.282
All right, now.

24:50.989 --> 24:52.456
That
looks good, son.

24:52.524 --> 24:53.718
What's up?

24:53.792 --> 24:55.282
I found him.

24:56.595 --> 24:59.063
Where at?
His punk ass
laying low

24:59.130 --> 25:01.462
about two and a half
hours away from here
in Bubbat County,

25:01.533 --> 25:03.626
hiding like
a little bitch.

25:03.702 --> 25:05.567
You sure It's him?
Man, for sure.

25:06.972 --> 25:08.633
Tomorrow night.

25:08.707 --> 25:10.004
You in?

25:11.543 --> 25:12.771
You know I'm down.

25:17.148 --> 25:19.878
It says "Landry. "
Yeah, you got it.
Right there.

25:19.951 --> 25:21.316
Press play.

25:21.620 --> 25:22.746
Oh.

25:23.922 --> 25:25.890
This is, um...

25:25.957 --> 25:28.517
This is all just
crowd noise,
though, Jess.

25:28.593 --> 25:30.424
It's a football thing.
Y'all never, you know...

25:30.495 --> 25:31.621
Oh, so I listen...
You can hear a crowd.

25:31.696 --> 25:32.958
I listen to this
while I'm kicking.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.293
While you're kicking,
while you're practicing.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.492
Oh.
Just use it.

25:35.567 --> 25:37.296
Practice to it, okay?

25:37.369 --> 25:39.394
All right.
Well, thank you.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.268
One of these
days, fellows.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.743
I'm jealous.
I'm so jealous.

25:47.812 --> 25:49.939
That's what I thought.
That's what I thought.

25:50.982 --> 25:52.882
Jealousy is
an ugly thing.

25:53.151 --> 25:54.482
Hey, Clarke!

25:54.553 --> 25:56.145
Can I talk to you
for a second?

25:58.957 --> 26:00.686
You're a good dude.

26:01.593 --> 26:04.221
And Jess, she
deserves the best.

26:04.963 --> 26:07.454
I'm glad you two
are together.

26:08.833 --> 26:10.357
Make her happy.

26:55.580 --> 26:57.445
It's pretty wild, huh?

26:58.350 --> 26:59.442
Yeah.

27:01.052 --> 27:03.543
How do you get away
with just sleeping
like this?

27:04.889 --> 27:06.789
I think
he's winking at me.

27:08.226 --> 27:09.318
Yeah.

27:11.563 --> 27:12.757
All right.

27:12.831 --> 27:14.594
You want to ride
into work together?

27:14.666 --> 27:16.497
You're good.
Be a dad for a day.

27:16.568 --> 27:17.660
You serious?
Yeah.

27:17.736 --> 27:18.794
We got two cars
coming in.
Yeah.

27:18.870 --> 27:20.428
I can take care
of two cars, Billy.

27:20.505 --> 27:21.733
Can you?

27:21.806 --> 27:23.671
Be a dad for a day.
Hell, be a dad
for a week.

27:23.742 --> 27:25.903
All right.
Thanks, man.

27:26.177 --> 27:28.805
All right, little man,
keep your guard up.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.245
Stay angry.

27:32.884 --> 27:34.545
I'll see you.
Thanks, man.

27:34.619 --> 27:35.779
Hey.

27:38.323 --> 27:39.790
You did good.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.392
Thanks, man.

27:44.796 --> 27:46.923
Mmm. I'll see you.

27:49.267 --> 27:51.895
You're not angry,
are you, Stevie, hmm?

27:56.307 --> 27:59.367
You love your daddy,
Don't you, hmm?

28:00.145 --> 28:01.908
You love your daddy?

28:02.414 --> 28:04.314
Your daddy loves you.

28:14.959 --> 28:17.951
Yeah, I'm gonna
put men on this. Don't
you worry about that.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.997
As many men
as I can spare.

28:20.065 --> 28:22.158
Panthers did
this, Michael.

28:22.801 --> 28:25.065
I Don't know
if I'd jump on that
right away, Buddy.

28:25.136 --> 28:27.969
But you know me,
I'm gonna
follow up on it.

28:28.940 --> 28:30.430
What do you want to do
about the team?

28:30.508 --> 28:32.100
Just get them on the bus,
get them over to Carroll Park.

28:32.177 --> 28:34.236
I'll meet you over
there when I can.
Yes, sir.

28:34.312 --> 28:37.907
Taylor, why this
nonsense have to come
to my school, huh?

28:39.684 --> 28:42.517
Trouble always seems
to be drawn to you, Levi.
I Don't know.

28:42.587 --> 28:45.078
Yeah, ever since you came.
I guess you about right.

28:56.367 --> 28:57.664
Hello?
Hey.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.294
Did you hear what
the hell happened
over here?

28:59.370 --> 29:01.736
Yeah. I'm...
I'm sitting here with
Wade Aikmen, actually.

29:01.806 --> 29:03.671
We're gonna put
you on speaker.

29:03.742 --> 29:04.766
Hey, Coach.

29:04.843 --> 29:06.743
I talked to Principal
Burnwell twice already

29:06.811 --> 29:09.746
and we just wanted
to call you to talk
this whole thing over.

29:09.814 --> 29:11.975
Eric,
I just wanted to
assure you that

29:12.050 --> 29:14.450
if any of our players
had anything to do
with this,

29:14.519 --> 29:16.612
I'll punish them.
I'll suspend them from
the team if I have to.

29:16.688 --> 29:18.986
They won't play Friday.
Okay.

29:19.057 --> 29:20.547
So, how bad is the
damage over there?

29:20.625 --> 29:22.889
Do we need to call
the conference director
or anything?

29:22.961 --> 29:25.953
Well, I just
got off the phone
with him, Wade.

29:26.064 --> 29:27.793
And what are you
guys thinking?

29:27.866 --> 29:30.835
You know what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking maybe you give
me a call back in an hour.

29:30.902 --> 29:32.563
I'd like to talk
to my wife for
a few minutes.

29:32.637 --> 29:34.764
All right, I'II...
I'll call you in
about an hour, then.

29:34.839 --> 29:36.170
Thanks, Wade.

29:36.241 --> 29:37.367
I'll see what
I can find out, okay?

29:37.442 --> 29:39.410
All right. You mind
closing that door?

29:39.477 --> 29:41.001
Yeah.
Thank you.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.643
Hey, babe.
How you holding up?

29:46.217 --> 29:48.447
I am not playing
on a fair field here.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.216
I know.
That makes two of us, hon.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.189
You gonna be all right?

29:55.894 --> 29:56.986
Yeah.

29:59.230 --> 30:01.095
All right,
I'll see you at home.

30:01.166 --> 30:02.497
All right.

30:07.238 --> 30:08.671
Yeah.

30:26.424 --> 30:27.755
Do you love it?

30:30.094 --> 30:31.823
That's an understatement.

30:33.298 --> 30:34.526
Oh, man.

30:35.834 --> 30:36.926
Never thought
I'd say this,

30:37.001 --> 30:40.664
but I do feel like
I figured it out,
you know?

30:42.106 --> 30:43.903
Figured out...

30:43.975 --> 30:45.033
Life.

30:45.109 --> 30:46.872
Life?
What It's all
about, you know?

30:46.945 --> 30:48.207
This.

30:48.847 --> 30:53.375
You know, owning this land,
and Billy, and just
his son, and...

30:54.619 --> 30:57.247
The shop doing as well
as it is, and...

30:57.856 --> 30:59.847
You know, I don't...

30:59.924 --> 31:01.448
It's just so...

31:02.827 --> 31:04.158
I'm happy.

31:04.963 --> 31:07.090
And I can honestly
say that.

31:11.002 --> 31:12.264
Like...

31:13.471 --> 31:14.961
It's so great.

31:18.276 --> 31:19.504
Thank you.

31:24.148 --> 31:25.740
Tim, I love you.

31:35.860 --> 31:37.487
We can't do this.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.228
I'm sorry.

31:56.247 --> 31:57.373
I'll be...

31:57.448 --> 31:59.313
Why are
you here right now?

31:59.384 --> 32:00.817
What the hell you say
that to Landry for, huh?

32:02.220 --> 32:03.551
Hey, yo,
Vince, come on!

32:03.621 --> 32:05.350
I'll be a second!
I'll be coming right down!

32:05.423 --> 32:06.481
Come on!
I ain't got time for that.

32:06.557 --> 32:08.218
I ain't got time for this.
Jess, I Don't got time.

32:08.293 --> 32:09.851
Oh, hell, no.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.418
Vince, you think
I'm stupid?

32:11.496 --> 32:12.554
Stupid about what?

32:12.630 --> 32:14.222
You think I Don't
know what you're
up to right now?

32:14.299 --> 32:16.267
No, uh-uh.
Hell, no.

32:16.334 --> 32:18.199
No. Vince, no.
Come on!

32:18.269 --> 32:19.463
Vince, no.

32:19.537 --> 32:21.437
Excuse me. I got
something to do right now.
Vince, please!

32:21.506 --> 32:23.440
No, Vince, Vince.
No. I know you.
Why are you here?

32:23.508 --> 32:24.566
I know you.
You Don't know me!

32:24.642 --> 32:26.200
I know that good guy
That's inside of you.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.608
No, you don't.
You got your good guy.

32:27.679 --> 32:28.805
You got your good guy!
Yeah. Yeah.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.177
Landry's so good
for me, right?

32:30.248 --> 32:31.909
Woman, please.
Woman, get out of my way.

32:31.983 --> 32:33.974
he's such a good guy,
right? And you're
horrible, right?

32:34.052 --> 32:35.349
That's exactly
what I am!

32:35.420 --> 32:36.580
I am a monster!

32:36.654 --> 32:38.884
That's what I am!
I'm that guy!

32:41.259 --> 32:42.419
Vince.

32:43.428 --> 32:44.827
Vince, come back!

33:06.351 --> 33:07.579
Okay.

33:38.149 --> 33:39.810
You Tim Riggins?

33:39.884 --> 33:42.375
33. You're the
football star, huh?

33:43.388 --> 33:44.753
Used to be.

33:46.057 --> 33:47.649
What you been
doing in here?

33:49.160 --> 33:51.025
Just fixing
cars, sir.

33:51.429 --> 33:53.294
We need
to ask you a few questions

33:54.065 --> 33:55.623
about some missing cars.

34:00.071 --> 34:03.131
Say, youngster,
you ever fired off
one of these?

34:03.207 --> 34:04.834
No.
Short barrel.

34:05.510 --> 34:08.775
Your pops used to
carry that gun,
or one just like it.

34:08.846 --> 34:11.178
Your pops, thug.
You cross him,

34:11.248 --> 34:13.513
you best believe
you was gonna get got.

34:13.583 --> 34:15.484
He said you ain't got
no thug in you.

34:15.553 --> 34:17.214
What you say?

34:17.288 --> 34:18.846
I say I'm
in the car, ain't I?

34:20.925 --> 34:23.757
Go on, take your drink in,
steel up them nerves.

34:24.962 --> 34:26.121
Go.

34:28.266 --> 34:30.893
When we get there,
we're gonna park about
a block away from the house.

34:32.437 --> 34:33.960
It's a trap house.
It ain't got but
two doors,

34:34.038 --> 34:36.563
one in the front
and one in the back.

34:36.841 --> 34:38.603
I walk up with
this sawed-off,

34:38.676 --> 34:40.337
blow a couple of holes
through the front door.

34:40.411 --> 34:43.244
Hell, everybody in there
either down or he running
towards the back door,

34:43.313 --> 34:44.679
and That's where you
waiting for his ass.

34:47.784 --> 34:49.547
That's payback, son.

34:50.588 --> 34:52.783
Now, he ain't stupid enough
to keep the bag on him
at the house,

34:52.857 --> 34:54.620
so I ain't saying we
coming up out of there
with my money.

34:54.692 --> 34:57.160
What I am saying is,
what I find or what
you come up on,

34:57.228 --> 34:59.958
we split up the middle,
50-50. You all right
with that?

35:01.432 --> 35:02.831
That's good?

35:03.668 --> 35:05.636
What the hell
wrong with you?

35:05.703 --> 35:07.000
Where the hell
you going?

35:07.071 --> 35:09.232
Get your ass

35:11.676 --> 35:12.802
Man, you acting
like a little bitch.

35:12.877 --> 35:14.572
You better get your ass
back in this car.

35:18.416 --> 35:21.510
No, this is one deal
you can't renege on, son.

35:21.586 --> 35:24.316
Ain't no backing out!
Backing out ain't
an option!

35:24.388 --> 35:26.219
What you gonna
do, son? Huh?

35:31.262 --> 35:33.389
If I get back
in that car...

35:37.301 --> 35:39.792
My mama's not supposed
to bury me, all right?

35:39.871 --> 35:41.566
I'm supposed to
bury my mama!

35:41.639 --> 35:44.073
Looks like to me
somebody gonna be
burying the both of you.

35:44.142 --> 35:47.908
Because you gonna die
if you Don't get your ass
back in this car.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.276
Now.

35:51.949 --> 35:54.076
All right, well,
do what you got
to do, then.

35:56.454 --> 35:58.547
Go ahead, man,
do what you got
to do, yo.

36:01.459 --> 36:03.654
Your old man was
right about you.

36:03.728 --> 36:06.754
You ain't nothing
but a soft-ass
little boy.

36:07.365 --> 36:09.526
Think this is over,
youngster?

36:09.600 --> 36:11.864
No, It's far
from over, junior.

36:11.936 --> 36:15.565
Oh, I got you.
I got you,
you little bitch!

36:40.097 --> 36:43.533
So this is all to say,
we're still working on it.

36:43.601 --> 36:45.933
Those are big tires
that did that damage.

36:46.003 --> 36:49.234
We Don't know
every truck in town
that size. Yet.

36:49.307 --> 36:51.639
But we're going to
check them all out.

36:51.709 --> 36:52.869
We'll find them.

36:52.944 --> 36:54.206
Sheriff, if I may.

36:54.278 --> 36:58.408
Eric, every parent
on our team was
contacted.

36:58.916 --> 37:01.476
Every single player
was accounted for.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.679
This was not
a retaliation.

37:04.188 --> 37:05.815
Retaliation?

37:07.024 --> 37:08.753
For the toothpicks.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.684
Toothpicks?
Yeah.

37:10.761 --> 37:12.126
Yeah, That's a prank.
Oh, really?

37:12.196 --> 37:13.891
Did you even see
what you did to
our field?

37:13.965 --> 37:15.398
Do you have any idea
how many man-hours it took?

37:15.466 --> 37:16.899
You cost us
a day of practice!

37:24.442 --> 37:26.137
Okay, fellows! Okay!

37:27.044 --> 37:30.104
Coaches! Please!

37:31.082 --> 37:34.245
Look, I know we got a lot
of hard feelings here.

37:34.318 --> 37:36.809
But look, the thing
we got to remember here

37:36.887 --> 37:40.050
is that in the end,
this is just
a football game.

37:42.193 --> 37:44.184
Hey, William,
you know what?

37:44.462 --> 37:46.487
My family's been getting
threatening phone calls

37:46.564 --> 37:48.361
all week long,
all times of the night.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.900
My home has been
vandalized, and my
field has been destroyed,

37:50.968 --> 37:54.096
so Don't patronize us
and tell us It's just
a damn football game.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.040
I'm sorry.

37:59.810 --> 38:02.438
Look, I know the longer
this goes on, the worse
this is just gonna get.

38:02.513 --> 38:04.845
So, I'm just gonna
cut to the chase.

38:04.915 --> 38:07.509
I spent the last
24 hours on the phone

38:07.952 --> 38:11.410
talking to every school
from kingdom come
to Timbuktu.

38:11.489 --> 38:14.151
And with the short notice
and Thanksgiving coming up,

38:14.225 --> 38:16.216
we couldn't find
a neutral site.

38:20.298 --> 38:23.233
But there is a proposal
from West Dillon.

38:24.435 --> 38:26.335
You have got
to be kidding.
I Don't want to hear it.

38:26.404 --> 38:28.395
This is our home
football game!

39:18.389 --> 39:19.686
I didn't do it.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.882
I'm sorry, man.

41:06.163 --> 41:07.687
I'm sorry.

41:16.607 --> 41:17.904
Hey.

41:25.983 --> 41:28.383
Game's gonna be
at Herrmann Field.

41:29.753 --> 41:30.845
I'm sorry, babe.

41:33.157 --> 41:36.183
I heard they were talking
about doing that.

41:56.647 --> 41:58.137
I'm sorry.

41:59.950 --> 42:01.315
It's okay.

42:05.656 --> 42:07.749
I'm going to
make a statement.

42:08.292 --> 42:09.691
What statement are
you going to make?

42:12.963 --> 42:14.624
You guys okay?

42:15.499 --> 42:17.865
Yeah, hon.
It's all right.
