00:03.046 --> 00:04.743
- When my parents were
alive I was always doing

00:04.874 --> 00:07.007
what was expected of me.

00:07.137 --> 00:11.489
And then, with the
marriage and then the baby,

00:11.620 --> 00:13.839
my whole world
became about that.

00:13.970 --> 00:15.754
And then when my parents passed

00:15.885 --> 00:18.540
I was expected to run the
business all on my own.

00:18.670 --> 00:21.934
And it's not that I didn't
wanna do any of those things,

00:22.065 --> 00:25.503
I love being a wife, and
I love being a mother,

00:25.634 --> 00:27.201
and being able to
run the business.

00:27.331 --> 00:31.292
It felt like there was
always something missing,

00:32.989 --> 00:34.860
something
that wasn't right.

00:36.645 --> 00:39.735
And I ignored it.
And I ignored it.

00:39.865 --> 00:42.564
And then I found out everything
that you hid from me,

00:42.694 --> 00:46.220
and I had done so
much for our family,

00:46.350 --> 00:49.440
and this is how I was
treated in return.

00:49.571 --> 00:50.876
It, it was unfair.

00:52.661 --> 00:54.576
Emily,
that is great.

00:54.706 --> 00:57.100
You are opening up,
you're really opening up.

00:57.231 --> 00:59.233
That's exactly what
these sessions are for,

00:59.363 --> 01:01.583
so you and Kyle have
a safe space to talk.

01:03.106 --> 01:05.935
How's it make you feel to
hear Emily say those things?

01:06.066 --> 01:07.632
- She feels like our
marriage was a mistake.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.330
- That's not what I'm saying.

01:09.460 --> 01:12.115
- Let's talk about
how we are feeling

01:12.246 --> 01:15.031
and not assign feelings
to someone else.

01:15.162 --> 01:17.816
Is there a way that you can
say that to Emily? Another way?

01:19.122 --> 01:20.515
- When I hear you say that,

01:20.645 --> 01:22.604
I interpret it to mean

01:22.734 --> 01:26.738
that you wish you made
different choices,

01:26.869 --> 01:28.827
about me, about us.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.180
- I don't regret
our life together.

01:33.310 --> 01:36.966
I just, I want things to go
back to the way they were.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.926
- It's hard not to
get stuck in the past,

01:41.057 --> 01:43.842
but how can we use
what we know now

01:43.973 --> 01:45.017
to improve in the future?

01:48.325 --> 01:52.634
- I mean, for me, I think
it starts with honesty.

01:52.764 --> 01:53.852
I can promise that.

01:55.898 --> 01:57.073
- Sometimes certain
decisions are precipitated

01:57.204 --> 02:00.076
by how we might
feel at the moment.

02:00.207 --> 02:02.034
It's important that you express

02:02.165 --> 02:04.689
to Emily things you want
her to improve upon as well.

02:05.734 --> 02:06.517
- Okay.

02:12.349 --> 02:15.047
I just never felt
good enough for you.

02:16.223 --> 02:18.050
Is that...

02:19.704 --> 02:21.966
I mean, I- I remember
the first time

02:22.098 --> 02:24.405
that I ever saw
you and I thought,

02:24.535 --> 02:26.102
"That is my dream girl."

02:26.233 --> 02:29.758
But I also thought, "I'm never
gonna get a girl like that."

02:31.977 --> 02:35.024
And then you looked at
me and you smiled and.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.112
Do you remember?

02:37.940 --> 02:39.115
Well, we just, we
started talking

02:39.246 --> 02:42.901
and I, I'd never
felt that way before.

02:45.339 --> 02:46.296
But if I'm being honest,
from that moment,

02:46.427 --> 02:51.214
I- I was scared that
I was gonna lose you.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.656
- I didn't know that's
how you felt, Kyle.

02:58.787 --> 02:59.266
- Yeah.

03:00.745 --> 03:01.833
- You were always enough.

03:02.965 --> 03:04.227
Always.

03:04.358 --> 03:07.665
- I just want my family back.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.798
Daddy.

03:09.928 --> 03:10.973
- Hey.
- All right.

03:11.103 --> 03:12.540
Let's end there for today.

03:12.670 --> 03:13.802
You guys did great.

03:13.932 --> 03:14.846
It's a great session.

03:14.977 --> 03:15.934
You guys should be really proud

03:16.065 --> 03:17.893
of the progress you're making.

03:18.023 --> 03:20.243
- All right, we gotta
get you ready, okay?

03:20.374 --> 03:23.246
Mwah, you have an
awesome day at school,

03:23.377 --> 03:25.292
and I wanna hear all about it.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.032
- Americano?

04:56.731 --> 04:57.949
Good morning.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.864
- I think it was
a great morning.

04:59.995 --> 05:01.344
- Hm, you know what would
make an even better morning?

05:01.475 --> 05:02.867
If we drove to work
in one car together.

05:04.042 --> 05:04.869
- I'll think about it.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.658
- Morning, Cassie.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.880
- He looks happy this morning.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.839
Guessing counseling went well.

05:17.969 --> 05:20.145
- I think we're
making real progress.

05:20.276 --> 05:21.886
It feels different.

05:22.017 --> 05:24.672
Good now. He's really trying.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.108
Love it.

05:26.238 --> 05:26.935
You know, I'm rooting
for both of you.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.942
- It's the firm's
30th anniversary

05:34.072 --> 05:35.770
and it's three weeks away.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.251
I'm excited to announce
that the yacht club

05:39.382 --> 05:41.776
has a cancellation and we
can host the event there.

05:41.906 --> 05:43.299
- Ah.
- Oh, there.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.257
- My parents worked hard
to build this company,

05:45.388 --> 05:47.738
and I thought it would be
a great way to honor them.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.000
- Your parents loved boating.

05:49.131 --> 05:50.132
- Yeah.

05:50.262 --> 05:51.307
- So mark your calendars.

05:52.874 --> 05:55.311
There's one other development

05:55.442 --> 05:57.226
that I'd like to
share with you all.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.447
Recently, we've acquired
some major clients,

06:00.577 --> 06:02.840
and if we want to continue
with this trajectory,

06:02.971 --> 06:05.103
we have to have a
bigger outreach.

06:05.234 --> 06:08.063
I've decided that the best
way to expand this company

06:08.193 --> 06:10.239
to other states is to
partner with a PR firm

06:10.370 --> 06:13.416
that already has a
stronghold in those areas.

06:13.547 --> 06:14.330
And the company I feel most
comfortable partnering with

06:14.461 --> 06:16.637
is Viator.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.554
I know this is a big move,
but it's a business decision

06:20.684 --> 06:22.817
that my parents thought
about for a long time

06:22.947 --> 06:25.646
and didn't end up making
before their passing.

06:25.776 --> 06:27.343
I believe in the
future of this company

06:27.474 --> 06:29.127
and want to see it
grow and succeed

06:29.258 --> 06:30.999
in the way that I know it can.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.087
- Is this an acquisition?

06:32.217 --> 06:33.610
- No.

06:33.741 --> 06:34.872
- Sounds like an acquisition.

06:35.003 --> 06:37.919
- We'll be using their
resources in those areas,

06:38.049 --> 06:39.747
and they'll take a
percentage of the payment.

06:39.877 --> 06:41.183
It's a partnership.

06:41.313 --> 06:43.315
There will be no
buyout of our company.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.230
- When did you talk to them?

06:45.361 --> 06:47.885
- I've been talking to
them for a few weeks now.

06:48.016 --> 06:50.018
And the next step is getting
everyone here on board

06:50.148 --> 06:52.020
and contracts, which
I plan to draft

06:52.150 --> 06:53.151
and sign in the next month.

07:06.643 --> 07:09.167
You can play with your
Legos after homework, okay?

07:09.298 --> 07:10.865
Mommy!

07:14.216 --> 07:16.174
- Are you all right?

07:16.305 --> 07:18.960
- I- I- I think my heart
literally fell out of my body.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.048
- I almost hit you.

07:20.178 --> 07:21.702
- I was just, uh, um.

07:23.617 --> 07:24.400
I'm here for the interview
for the babysitting position.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.402
- Yes. Oh!

07:34.671 --> 07:37.500
Sorry about the scare.

07:37.631 --> 07:40.329
I wasn't expecting
you for another hour.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.200
- I know. It's totally my fault.

07:42.331 --> 07:43.985
I was coming from out of town

07:44.115 --> 07:46.074
and I didn't know how
long it would take me.

07:46.204 --> 07:48.076
This is a beautiful place.

07:48.206 --> 07:50.207
- Thank you.
- Did you build this yourself?

07:50.339 --> 07:52.558
- No, it belonged to my parents.

07:52.689 --> 07:54.256
You grew up here?

07:54.386 --> 07:56.171
I moved
here when I was three.

07:56.301 --> 07:57.477
Lily, right?

07:57.607 --> 07:59.348
- Yeah.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.131
- How long have you
been working with kids?

08:00.262 --> 08:01.916
- Uh, few years now.

08:03.178 --> 08:04.396
- You said you just got to town.

08:04.527 --> 08:05.310
Where were you coming from?

08:05.441 --> 08:07.530
- Down south. Texas.

08:07.661 --> 08:10.141
- Oh, my, my family's
originally from Texas.

08:10.272 --> 08:12.013
- Oh.

08:12.143 --> 08:12.317
- What do you think of
Forest Hills so far?

08:12.448 --> 08:13.014
- Mommy?

08:13.144 --> 08:14.668
I saw someone outside.

08:14.798 --> 08:17.409
It's probably
just an animal, honey.

08:17.540 --> 08:18.759
- Didn't we say dinner?

08:20.500 --> 08:21.370
What's going on?

08:21.501 --> 08:22.457
- Daddy!
- Lily,

08:22.589 --> 08:24.025
this is my husband, Kyle.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.243
Kyle, this is Lily.

08:25.374 --> 08:27.463
She's interviewing to
be Nina's babysitter.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.204
- I don't wanna
intrude on dinner.

08:29.334 --> 08:30.988
- No, not at all.

08:31.119 --> 08:32.381
We, we always have
more than enough.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.905
It'll be good for you
to spend time with Nina.

08:35.036 --> 08:36.472
Nina, why don't you show Lily

08:36.602 --> 08:37.472
what you've been
working on there?

08:42.390 --> 08:44.261
- A babysitter?

08:44.393 --> 08:46.134
- Uh, with all our new clients
I've been working later,

08:46.264 --> 08:47.614
and I need someone
to help watch Nina

08:47.744 --> 08:49.180
a few afternoons a week.

08:49.311 --> 08:50.704
- I don't feel comfortable

08:50.834 --> 08:52.619
with some stranger being
alone with our child.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.795
- Well, that stranger came
from a reputable site.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.492
She's got great references.

08:56.623 --> 08:57.580
When did you
decide to do this?

08:57.711 --> 09:00.017
- I don't know, two weeks ago.

09:00.148 --> 09:01.976
- Why didn't you
ask me about it?

09:02.106 --> 09:03.673
- We're both meeting her
now, at the same time.

09:03.804 --> 09:04.631
I don't know what
the problem is.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.328
- I will find someone,

09:06.458 --> 09:07.416
if you're desperate
for a babysitter.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.156
- Kyle, relax.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.158
You don't even know her.

09:10.288 --> 09:11.420
- Yes, that's the point.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.204
We don't know her.

09:13.335 --> 09:14.554
It's my child and I
should have been consul.

09:15.946 --> 09:18.035
- He's right. I misled you.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.169
I answered your babysitting ad

09:21.299 --> 09:24.215
because I wanted to
meet you, actually.

09:24.346 --> 09:25.477
- Me?

09:26.783 --> 09:28.611
I- I wanted
to know who you were.

09:30.700 --> 09:31.701
- I'm not following.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.660
- I don't know how to say this.

09:33.790 --> 09:38.316
I, um. We're related.

09:40.144 --> 09:41.015
Related how?

09:44.148 --> 09:45.540
- We're, we're sisters.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.065
- What?

09:50.677 --> 09:52.635
I can't tell if
this is a joke, or.

09:52.766 --> 09:53.636
- I'm not joking.

09:57.335 --> 09:58.336
I'm your older sister.

10:02.471 --> 10:03.167
- I don't understand, I.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.477
- If I can just explain.

10:08.608 --> 10:12.220
I think that we, our parents.

10:12.350 --> 10:14.439
- I think you need to leave.

10:16.224 --> 10:17.486
- I know you need
time to digest.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.924
Um, I'm sorry. Here's my number.

10:22.534 --> 10:24.188
Maybe we can talk more
about it tomorrow.

10:36.853 --> 10:39.290
You're not actually
gonna believe that woman,

10:39.421 --> 10:40.248
are you?

10:41.728 --> 10:43.555
- My parents' names are on-
- Em.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.122
- Her birth certificate.

10:45.253 --> 10:47.168
- Anybody can forge that.

10:47.298 --> 10:49.344
- Well, why would someone lie
about something like this?

10:49.474 --> 10:50.388
- I don't know, but
why would she show up

10:50.519 --> 10:51.476
just out of the blue?

10:51.607 --> 10:52.608
It is all very suspicious.

10:52.739 --> 10:55.045
- Mommy, mommy!

10:55.176 --> 10:55.698
Are, are you okay?

10:57.831 --> 11:00.398
Em, sometimes
you're too trusting.

11:00.529 --> 11:01.704
You can't just let anyone in.

11:12.236 --> 11:14.064
All right, she'll dream.

11:20.244 --> 11:22.377
You know, Em, I don't
feel comfortable

11:22.507 --> 11:24.466
leaving the two of you
alone here tonight.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.381
I mean, what if that
woman comes back?

11:26.511 --> 11:28.122
- We'll be fine.

11:28.252 --> 11:29.558
I could sleep
in the other room.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.603
- I appreciate that,
Kyle, but we'll be fine.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.433
There was something
so familiar about her.

11:35.564 --> 11:36.652
- Don't let that rattle you.

11:40.656 --> 11:44.225
You know, Em, I
have to be honest,

11:44.355 --> 11:46.140
I feel like you're
hiding things from me.

11:47.228 --> 11:49.056
- Hiding from you?

11:49.186 --> 11:51.362
- Yeah, first the Viator
thing this morning,

11:51.493 --> 11:53.147
now you're looking
for a babysitter.

11:53.277 --> 11:55.192
Why aren't we talking
about these things?

11:55.323 --> 11:57.542
- There was already so
much going on between us,

11:57.673 --> 11:59.327
I didn't know how to
bring all this extra stuff

11:59.457 --> 12:00.981
into the mix.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.678
- But these are
huge decisions, Em.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.680
Look, I get it,
that you are someone

12:04.811 --> 12:08.597
who likes to run
everything yourself,

12:08.728 --> 12:10.730
but there are those of
us who care about you

12:10.860 --> 12:12.253
and wanna help you.

12:12.383 --> 12:14.690
Especially if we're partners
inside and outside of work.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.605
- You're right.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.304
I'm sorry, I should have
talked to you about it.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.004
- Look at us communicating.

12:25.483 --> 12:26.484
Your sister?

12:27.616 --> 12:28.660
- That's what she said.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.360
- I don't even know what to say.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.492
What are you gonna do?

12:34.623 --> 12:35.842
- I'm trying to see what I
can find about her online,

12:35.972 --> 12:37.887
but so far I haven't
found anything.

12:38.018 --> 12:40.237
Her name doesn't
show up anywhere.

12:40.368 --> 12:41.804
Not even on social sites.

12:41.935 --> 12:44.024
- Well, that could be
a really good thing

12:44.154 --> 12:45.808
or a really bad thing.

12:45.939 --> 12:48.245
My sister's best friend's
aunt met this guy

12:48.376 --> 12:49.725
who didn't have
any digital trace,

12:49.856 --> 12:53.207
and he ended up-
- Being a serial killer?

12:53.337 --> 12:55.209
- Being a very nice guy.

12:57.428 --> 12:58.734
- How's it going?

12:58.865 --> 12:59.822
We were
just discussing

12:59.953 --> 13:01.389
your supposed new family member.

13:01.519 --> 13:02.390
- She's a fraud.

13:04.522 --> 13:08.178
- Is this fraud my height
and has curly auburn hair?

13:08.309 --> 13:09.745
- I'm gonna tell her to leave.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.486
- No, don't. I
asked her to come.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.227
- What? Why?

13:13.357 --> 13:14.619
- Because she agreed
to do a DNA test,

13:14.750 --> 13:16.665
so we're going to
see Dr. Andrews.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.363
Then we'll know for sure, right?

13:19.494 --> 13:20.277
Emily.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.688
This is awkward.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.733
- It really is.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.388
- I'm sorry I lied to you
about the babysitter position.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.782
How do you walk into
someone's life and just say,

13:46.913 --> 13:49.393
"I'm the older sister
you never knew you had"?

13:51.439 --> 13:53.789
I didn't know how to go
about doing any of this.

13:55.660 --> 13:56.270
- Maybe a letter?

13:58.707 --> 14:00.709
- Right.
- Or a phone call.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.190
Okay.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.495
In hindsight, I can see

14:04.626 --> 14:07.324
that either of those
methods could have worked.

14:09.674 --> 14:13.330
Honestly, I wanted to meet you
first before I said anything.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.117
I just wanted to find out what
kind of a person you were.

14:17.247 --> 14:18.683
- It's a lot to take in.

14:18.814 --> 14:19.597
- I know.

14:32.436 --> 14:34.351
- I have so many questions.

14:35.700 --> 14:36.614
- Well, ask away.

14:38.747 --> 14:40.401
Well, how old
were you when my parents-

14:40.531 --> 14:41.054
- Sent me away?

14:44.709 --> 14:47.321
I was about six years old.

14:47.451 --> 14:48.539
- Where did you grow up?

14:48.670 --> 14:50.367
- In a boarding facility.

14:50.498 --> 14:51.673
- Did they ever come visit you?

14:53.240 --> 14:53.893
No.

14:55.851 --> 14:57.331
- Did you ever try
to contact them?

14:58.810 --> 15:00.421
- I didn't want anything
to do with them.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.467
I regret that now.

15:05.513 --> 15:07.645
I wish I'd had the
opportunity to say goodbye.

15:09.647 --> 15:11.519
It's just, I,

15:13.651 --> 15:16.002
I can't imagine them ever
doing something like that

15:16.132 --> 15:18.352
and to not even say
anything before they passed.

15:18.482 --> 15:19.657
- People can surprise you.

15:20.397 --> 15:22.486
How well do you
really know anyone?

15:28.101 --> 15:30.668
- Why do you think they
didn't say anything?

15:30.799 --> 15:32.366
- I don't know.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.455
Maybe they were
hoping you'd forget.

15:34.585 --> 15:35.108
- Forget what?

15:36.979 --> 15:38.459
- The years that overlapped.

15:38.589 --> 15:39.634
- What do you mean?

15:39.764 --> 15:41.505
- You were two when
they sent me away.

15:43.116 --> 15:44.856
You're too young to
remember anything.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.510
I barely remember anything.

15:48.512 --> 15:49.905
The one thing that
sticks out in my memory

15:50.036 --> 15:52.777
is this toy that you had.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.866
It was like a red
dog or something.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.434
- A fox. It was a red fox.

15:58.783 --> 16:01.525
You were
obsessed with that thing.

16:03.614 --> 16:04.789
It was literally attached
to you at all times.

16:10.534 --> 16:11.231
- Are you both ready?

16:13.146 --> 16:14.886
Let's do it.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.557
Hello?

16:33.688 --> 16:35.907
- Hi, this is Emily Caldwell.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.084
I'm calling about a payment
that my parents made

16:38.214 --> 16:39.999
to the school years ago.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.131
- Oh, we haven't been
a school for some time.

16:42.262 --> 16:45.308
We're a nonprofit
organization now.

16:46.918 --> 16:47.832
- Well, my parents
made a payment

16:47.963 --> 16:49.834
to the organization every year.

16:49.965 --> 16:51.401
Could you tell me
what that was for,

16:51.532 --> 16:53.186
if, if I gave you their name?

16:53.316 --> 16:54.970
What year did
they give the money?

16:56.841 --> 16:58.713
- I don't know the
exact span of years,

16:58.843 --> 17:00.932
but I- I definitely
know it was in the '90s.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.588
I'm afraid
I can't help you.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.851
We only keep files on
our end for seven years.

17:06.982 --> 17:08.810
If they were paying
for a student,

17:08.940 --> 17:11.073
those files would be shipped
to them post-graduation.

17:12.901 --> 17:15.121
- So you would've sent
the files to my parents?

17:15.251 --> 17:18.385
If they were the
custodians on the account, yes.

17:18.515 --> 17:19.473
- All right, thank you.

18:27.976 --> 18:28.846
Hey.

18:30.979 --> 18:32.154
- Thought you all had
forgotten about this place

18:32.285 --> 18:33.547
until that man showed
up to look at it.

18:34.635 --> 18:36.071
- What man?

18:36.202 --> 18:36.985
Someone's been to
see this locker?

18:37.116 --> 18:38.117
- Yeah. Last week.

18:39.727 --> 18:41.032
- Are you sure?

18:41.163 --> 18:42.817
- Sure I'm sure.

18:42.947 --> 18:44.471
Nobody's been to this
locker in five years,

18:44.601 --> 18:46.212
so I definitely remember
he came to see that one.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.736
- And he had the code?

18:48.866 --> 18:50.259
- Yes, ma'am.

18:50.390 --> 18:51.565
- Well, do you
remember his name?

18:51.695 --> 18:52.957
Did he have to sign in?

18:53.088 --> 18:55.090
- No, we don't
have sign-ins here.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.136
It's that big one
right over there.

20:18.217 --> 20:23.134
Hello?

20:53.948 --> 20:55.079
Get cozy.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.038
- Thank you.
- There you go.

20:57.168 --> 20:58.126
Good?
- Yeah.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.083
- Okay.

21:09.920 --> 21:10.791
- Mommy.

21:12.923 --> 21:13.837
Are you all
right? What happened?

21:13.968 --> 21:14.925
- Hi.
- Mommy.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.798
- Hey. Nina, Cassie's here.

21:17.928 --> 21:19.800
Why don't you, why don't
you get your magic set

21:19.930 --> 21:21.236
and show her some
of your tricks?

21:21.367 --> 21:23.020
- I wanna stay here with you.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.935
- We just need to talk
for a little bit, honey.

21:25.066 --> 21:25.806
- Okay, Mommy.
- There you go.

21:25.936 --> 21:26.981
- Thank you.

21:27.111 --> 21:28.809
Come on,
sweetie, let's go.

21:36.120 --> 21:36.991
- I went to my
parents' storage unit

21:37.121 --> 21:41.343
and this man jumped
out and grabbed me.

21:41.474 --> 21:43.040
- Grabbed you?

21:43.171 --> 21:44.477
What was he trying to do?

21:44.607 --> 21:46.130
- I don't know.
It was terrifying.

21:46.261 --> 21:47.436
- What did the police say?

21:49.308 --> 21:51.222
- Uh, that he most
likely was looking

21:51.353 --> 21:53.094
for something valuable.

21:53.224 --> 21:54.965
Apparently it happens a lot.

21:55.096 --> 21:56.532
- Were there security cameras?

21:56.663 --> 21:57.838
They said
they weren't working.

21:57.968 --> 21:58.752
- Of course not.

22:00.449 --> 22:01.189
Hmm.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.324
What were you even doing at
your parents' storage unit?

22:05.454 --> 22:10.285
- Um, I was looking for some
old paperwork from my parents.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.505
The manager said that a man
had been to the storage unit

22:12.635 --> 22:15.856
in the past week
and had the code.

22:17.118 --> 22:18.946
- It was me. I went there.

22:19.076 --> 22:21.296
I was looking for something
nostalgic to give you as a gift.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.907
Maybe refinish the old desk.

22:24.038 --> 22:25.518
You've been missing your
parents a lot lately,

22:25.648 --> 22:27.346
and I thought that
it could help.

22:29.173 --> 22:30.131
- How did you know
about the unit?

22:30.261 --> 22:31.306
- Your dad showed it to me.

22:31.437 --> 22:32.960
When we cleaned out the files

22:33.090 --> 22:34.831
from his office, that's
where we put them.

22:34.962 --> 22:37.094
I thought you knew about that.

22:37.225 --> 22:41.055
Listen, Em, I think we
need to take a pause

22:41.185 --> 22:43.405
with everything that's
happening at work.

22:43.536 --> 22:46.365
- Why?
- Because this is a big deal.

22:46.495 --> 22:47.844
You need to recover from this.

22:47.975 --> 22:49.846
- Oh, don't be silly.

22:49.977 --> 22:52.849
The anniversary party isn't
for another couple weeks.

22:54.242 --> 22:55.112
- I'm hungry.

22:55.243 --> 22:56.375
- Yeah, me too.

22:56.505 --> 22:56.940
Cass, you wanna stay for dinner?

22:57.071 --> 22:58.464
- Yeah, I'd love to.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.818
- There's something
I need to tell you.

23:04.948 --> 23:07.473
- Can we just talk about
it after dinner, please?

23:19.310 --> 23:21.356
- I- I tried knocking.

23:21.487 --> 23:22.923
The front door was locked,
so I just came round back.

23:23.053 --> 23:24.315
- I wasn't sure if
you got my message.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.100
- I didn't realize
you invited her.

23:26.230 --> 23:28.015
It's so
beautiful. Thank you.

23:28.145 --> 23:29.103
- How are you feeling?

23:29.233 --> 23:31.801
- I'm better now that
everyone is here.

23:31.932 --> 23:32.411
Ah-huh.

23:33.977 --> 23:35.979
- Um, thank you.

23:36.110 --> 23:36.458
We're just about to sit to
eat. You should join us.

23:36.589 --> 23:39.113
- Oh, okay.

23:39.243 --> 23:40.941
- Kyle is an exceptional cook.

23:41.071 --> 23:42.377
- Oh, really?
- Well,

23:42.508 --> 23:43.857
exceptional is a strong word.

23:45.685 --> 23:48.949
- Are you staying in town, Lily?

23:49.079 --> 23:51.299
- Uh, no, I'm at
the Gold Coast Inn.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.170
- Oh.

23:53.301 --> 23:55.042
- It's the best I can
afford at the moment.

23:55.172 --> 23:56.957
- Maybe I can help you find
a place closer to town.

23:57.087 --> 23:58.741
- That would be
amazing. Thank you.

23:58.872 --> 24:00.221
- Yeah. Of course.

24:00.351 --> 24:01.962
- So what's the plan, Lily?

24:02.092 --> 24:04.355
Fake being Emily's
sister, and then what?

24:04.486 --> 24:06.488
- I'm not faking.

24:06.619 --> 24:09.012
I don't know what
he's talking about.

24:09.143 --> 24:11.580
- Okay, I was gonna say
something after dinner,

24:11.711 --> 24:15.454
but I can't just sit here and
listen to her manipulate you.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.546
When I was leaving
work, Dr. Andrews called

24:20.676 --> 24:22.243
and he said the DNA
test results were ready.

24:22.373 --> 24:24.288
So I went by, picked them up

24:26.203 --> 24:26.987
and opened them.

24:29.076 --> 24:29.816
- I'm telling the truth.

24:31.687 --> 24:33.210
It says
you're not my sister.

24:33.341 --> 24:34.995
- That's impossible.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.997
- You see, if anyone
reads that document,

24:37.127 --> 24:38.520
they're never gonna believe you.

24:38.651 --> 24:41.262
So I think it's time
for you to leave.

24:41.392 --> 24:44.004
- Emily, I'm telling you
the truth. I'm your sister.

24:44.134 --> 24:46.136
- I think you should
go. I'm sorry.

25:03.589 --> 25:04.851
- What just happened?

25:09.508 --> 25:11.466
- I'm sorry, Em.

25:11.597 --> 25:13.860
I know you were really hoping
that she was your sister.

25:15.078 --> 25:16.427
- I'm just so confused.

25:16.558 --> 25:18.386
I mean, why would
she lie about this?

25:20.519 --> 25:21.302
- I don't know.

25:23.260 --> 25:25.306
She obviously really
wanted something from you.

25:25.436 --> 25:28.352
But she knew things.

25:28.483 --> 25:31.399
How could she know all those
things about me and my family?

25:31.530 --> 25:33.009
- She obviously
did her research.

25:35.098 --> 25:36.404
- And even her name.

25:36.535 --> 25:40.016
Lilies were my mother's
favorite flower.

25:40.147 --> 25:41.496
Just all seemed to add up.

25:43.193 --> 25:45.456
Even the payments
to that academy.

25:45.587 --> 25:46.370
- What academy?

25:48.459 --> 25:51.071
- My parents made a payment
to this school for years.

25:51.201 --> 25:53.247
I just assumed that
it was for Lily.

25:53.377 --> 25:55.292
- It was probably
just a donation.

25:55.423 --> 25:56.511
I mean, your parents
gave a lot of money

25:56.642 --> 25:58.208
to a lot of different charities.

26:00.297 --> 26:03.518
But think about it, Em,
this woman just shows up.

26:05.389 --> 26:06.608
She doesn't call you
for all those years.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.262
You can't find anything
about her online.

26:09.872 --> 26:10.873
This is someone who
doesn't want you to know

26:11.004 --> 26:12.005
who they really are.

26:20.840 --> 26:23.712
- I think I miss my parents.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.411
And when Lily showed
up maybe I thought

26:29.196 --> 26:31.111
that a part of them
was coming back to me.

26:32.939 --> 26:35.202
I should have known it
was too good to be true.

26:35.332 --> 26:37.596
- Em, you have a family.

26:40.468 --> 26:43.123
- I felt so lonely lately.

26:43.253 --> 26:44.080
- I know.

26:45.734 --> 26:49.172
But you and Nina are
everything to me.

26:49.303 --> 26:50.565
You're the only thing
that matters, and yes,

26:50.696 --> 26:52.480
I know I messed up.

26:53.916 --> 26:56.484
But I'm always gonna
be here for you.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.488
- I know.

27:02.751 --> 27:04.100
I guess it makes sense.

27:04.231 --> 27:07.321
It's, I can't imagine

27:07.451 --> 27:10.150
my parents giving
their child away

27:10.280 --> 27:11.630
and never speaking of it again.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.457
- Yeah.

27:15.329 --> 27:17.113
- Tonight I was
reminded why I love you.

27:18.332 --> 27:19.725
- Oh, yeah?

27:19.855 --> 27:21.770
- You were always
great at protecting me.

27:23.685 --> 27:25.382
You were looking out for
me and I didn't listen.

27:25.513 --> 27:27.341
I'm sorry.

27:27.471 --> 27:31.345
- Okay. So then
let's make a promise.

27:31.475 --> 27:33.564
The two of us will
always be a team,

27:33.695 --> 27:35.654
and we'll have each other's
backs no matter what.

27:36.872 --> 27:37.656
- Promise.
- Mm.

27:42.443 --> 27:44.663
I was thinking.

27:46.621 --> 27:48.231
- About getting in the hot tub?

27:48.362 --> 27:49.668
- No, I- I have to
get that thing fixed.

27:49.798 --> 27:51.060
- No, I already got it fixed.

27:51.191 --> 27:52.583
- What? When?

27:52.714 --> 27:54.107
- Well, you mentioned
it a few weeks ago,

27:54.237 --> 27:55.325
so I called someone.

27:55.456 --> 27:56.457
They came out, they fixed it.

27:56.587 --> 27:58.502
It should, it should be working.

28:00.374 --> 28:02.158
So what do you think?
It's a perfect night.

28:02.289 --> 28:03.377
A couple glasses of wine.

28:03.507 --> 28:05.205
The two of us.

28:05.335 --> 28:07.381
We do another night?

28:09.688 --> 28:10.514
- Deal.

28:11.951 --> 28:14.214
What are you thinking?

28:15.694 --> 28:19.567
- I was thinking that maybe
you should move back in.

28:22.613 --> 28:23.136
- Do you really?

28:25.312 --> 28:26.705
Do you really mean that?
- Yes.

28:30.491 --> 28:31.535
It's the right next step.

28:33.624 --> 28:36.584
We both wanna be together,
so has to happen eventually.

28:38.804 --> 28:41.241
And you're right, you, you
belong here, you're family.

28:46.768 --> 28:48.465
- Okay.

29:02.915 --> 29:05.091
- You ready to go, sweetie?
- Mm-hmm.

29:05.221 --> 29:06.396
- Here.

29:06.527 --> 29:08.355
- Oh, no, I don't need those.

29:08.485 --> 29:09.530
I was thinking we could
take one car to work today.

29:13.055 --> 29:15.797
I'll race ya.

29:15.928 --> 29:17.712
All right.

29:20.367 --> 29:21.020
May I have your bag?

29:22.891 --> 29:24.893
But
wait, there's more.

29:28.418 --> 29:30.116
I'm gonna close the
door, okay, sweetie?

29:31.595 --> 29:32.727
After you.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.729
- Oh. I could get used to this.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.209
- Could you?
- Mm-hmm.

29:54.705 --> 29:56.272
- No, I've got it.

29:58.318 --> 29:59.145
- Thank you.

30:08.284 --> 30:09.590
- Come on, we're
late. We're late!

30:09.720 --> 30:11.810
- Bye, honey.
- Bye, Mom.

30:11.940 --> 30:13.202
- Want me to get your backpack?

30:13.333 --> 30:14.682
- Yep. Got it.

30:15.901 --> 30:16.727
- Yeah? Let me get this one.

30:16.858 --> 30:17.728
- Okay.
- Okay.

30:17.859 --> 30:19.165
Come on, come on.

30:27.347 --> 30:28.739
- Hi, Cassie.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.350
Um, I just
need to tell you about-

30:30.480 --> 30:31.568
Oh, uh, Cassie,

30:31.699 --> 30:33.396
hang on a second, um, my
battery's about to die.

30:33.527 --> 30:34.833
I forgot to charge
my phone last night.

30:36.095 --> 30:39.359
Ah, hang on a second.

30:39.489 --> 30:41.317
Cassie, hang on.

30:46.453 --> 30:47.802
Hang on, hang on. Oh.

30:49.673 --> 30:50.936
- Em?
- See if he's got one.

30:51.066 --> 30:52.851
Em?

30:54.678 --> 30:55.941
- Cassie, are you still there?

30:57.377 --> 31:02.208
Oh.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.314
Em, let's go!

31:22.793 --> 31:23.882
What is this?

31:26.710 --> 31:27.494
- Emily, you weren't
listening to me.

31:27.624 --> 31:30.497
- You, you told me
it wasn't a match.

31:30.627 --> 31:33.674
Wait, you showed me a document
that said it wasn't a match.

31:33.804 --> 31:36.329
- You were so adamant to
have this person in our lives

31:36.459 --> 31:37.591
that we barely know.

31:37.721 --> 31:41.682
- So you forged fake
documents and lied to me?

31:41.812 --> 31:43.727
- Lily's not a good person.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.773
- What evidence do you have
that she's not a good person?

31:46.817 --> 31:47.862
That's what I thought.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.866
We just spent the entire night

31:51.997 --> 31:54.086
talking about having each
other's backs, how we're family.

31:54.216 --> 31:56.566
- Emily, I'm just,
I'm asking you-

31:56.697 --> 31:58.525
- You promised me honesty.

32:01.180 --> 32:04.357
- How can you not see
that Lily is lying to you?

32:04.487 --> 32:07.229
- Kyle, the only person
lying to me is you.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.796
How can you not see that?

32:10.711 --> 32:11.538
- Em.

32:15.803 --> 32:18.675
- That is the real document
from my doctor's office.

32:18.806 --> 32:21.722
I found it in Kyle's
trunk this morning.

32:21.852 --> 32:23.115
I don't know why you
would lie about this.

32:23.245 --> 32:25.030
- Maybe you felt threatened?

32:25.160 --> 32:26.945
- Maybe.

32:29.077 --> 32:32.602
He has said recently that he
was always afraid of losing me.

32:35.083 --> 32:37.868
- Is this the first time he's
done something like this?

32:37.999 --> 32:40.654
- No. We've had
some trouble lately.

32:42.264 --> 32:45.485
About six months ago,
Kyle was acting weird,

32:45.615 --> 32:47.878
stressed out more than usual.

32:48.009 --> 32:49.663
He kept saying it was work.

32:50.881 --> 32:51.926
Eventually I found out

32:52.057 --> 32:55.016
that he had taken money
out of our savings

32:55.147 --> 32:56.713
and invested it
without telling me,

32:56.844 --> 32:57.845
and then lost all of it.

32:59.716 --> 33:01.718
- I'm so sorry.

33:01.849 --> 33:04.852
- Yeah, it's been a rough
few months, and now this.

33:06.810 --> 33:07.637
We started marriage counseling

33:07.768 --> 33:09.683
and I thought it
was working, but.

33:14.122 --> 33:15.776
- Right before I moved here,

33:15.906 --> 33:16.081
I'd just gotten out
of a bad relationship.

33:16.211 --> 33:18.866
- Really?

33:18.997 --> 33:20.781
- It made me wanna
get in touch with you.

33:20.911 --> 33:22.652
I want someone in
my life I can trust.

33:24.306 --> 33:26.091
In the beginning it was great.

33:26.221 --> 33:28.789
He was great.

33:28.919 --> 33:30.747
Then he started
lying more and more,

33:30.878 --> 33:32.923
and eventually I
just got sick of it.

33:33.620 --> 33:35.535
- I guess that
runs in the family.

33:40.757 --> 33:42.803
Can we start fresh?

33:42.933 --> 33:44.848
Maybe you could come
over to the house later

33:44.979 --> 33:46.981
and spend time with Nina and I?

33:47.112 --> 33:47.808
- I would love that,

33:50.202 --> 33:52.943
but I'm actually
leaving town today.

33:53.074 --> 33:55.685
- You're leaving? Why?

33:55.816 --> 33:59.907
- It's embarrassing to say
this, but I'm out of money.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.822
No one seems to be
hiring in this town.

34:01.952 --> 34:03.911
- Well, why don't you
come work at the PR firm?

34:06.000 --> 34:07.784
- Really? What would
I even do there?

34:07.915 --> 34:09.612
- Anything.

34:09.743 --> 34:11.092
We could start you
part-time for now,

34:11.223 --> 34:12.963
and, and you could
stay at the house.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.922
Nina would love that.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.577
- Are you sure?
- Yes. You're family.

34:22.016 --> 34:23.626
- You mentioned over the phone

34:23.757 --> 34:25.672
you wanted to discuss
marital assets.

34:25.802 --> 34:28.978
Are you, uh, thinking
of getting a divorce?

34:29.110 --> 34:33.418
Uh, no.

34:33.549 --> 34:35.768
It's a little more
complicated than that.

34:35.899 --> 34:36.900
- Well, you've come
to the right office.

34:37.031 --> 34:39.902
We specialize in complicated.

34:40.034 --> 34:43.036
- My wife and I have been
separated for a few months.

34:43.168 --> 34:45.213
We share a daughter.

34:45.344 --> 34:47.824
Our home, and the place
of business where we work,

34:47.955 --> 34:51.437
were inherited from her
parents when they passed away.

34:51.567 --> 34:55.702
Now, recently, a relative
has come back into her life

34:55.831 --> 34:57.269
and I'm worried that-

34:57.399 --> 34:58.792
- The relative wants
to get their hands

34:58.922 --> 34:59.880
on some of the inheritance.

35:00.010 --> 35:01.969
- Exactly.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.798
She has already come
between me and my family,

35:04.928 --> 35:07.105
and I'm worried it's
just gonna get worse.

35:07.235 --> 35:08.889
- Are we talking
any relative, or?

35:09.019 --> 35:11.979
- It's a sister that
she never knew she had.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.634
- Oh, I see.

35:16.201 --> 35:17.767
That is complicated.

35:18.768 --> 35:19.856
- Nothing, I just.

35:20.422 --> 35:23.295
I get this impression

35:23.425 --> 35:25.949
that this sister doesn't
want me around my family.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.081
- Hm, what has she done so far?

35:27.212 --> 35:27.908
- I don't have specifics.

35:28.038 --> 35:30.084
It's, it's a general feeling.

35:31.868 --> 35:32.695
- Unless you can prove
malice with intent,

35:32.826 --> 35:35.133
there's not much a
legal court can do.

35:37.352 --> 35:39.006
- So you're saying I have
to prove she's dangerous?

35:40.225 --> 35:41.008
- Normally? Yeah.

36:17.610 --> 36:20.221
- Well, we've gone through
all the nuts and bolts.

36:20.352 --> 36:22.963
Organization of files,
sharing accounts.

36:23.093 --> 36:25.705
Basically I bored her
to death for an hour.

36:25.835 --> 36:27.881
- Okay. Well, let's hear it.

36:28.011 --> 36:29.796
What are your biggest
takeaways so far?

36:31.580 --> 36:34.844
- Important to connect
personally with clients,

36:34.975 --> 36:36.803
someone they can trust.

36:36.933 --> 36:38.021
When we send out proposals,

36:38.152 --> 36:39.893
we do a three-month, six-month,

36:40.023 --> 36:41.851
and one-year trajectory plan.

36:41.982 --> 36:43.331
- Pretty good for only being
here a couple of hours.

36:47.596 --> 36:50.382
We actually have a new
client coming in right now.

36:50.512 --> 36:52.166
I think it would be great for
you to sit in on the meeting

36:52.297 --> 36:54.037
and see how it all works.

36:54.168 --> 36:55.691
- Who's the client?

36:55.822 --> 36:57.215
- Aurora Botanicals.

36:58.912 --> 36:59.956
It's infused with
all natural oils

37:00.087 --> 37:02.959
that block the rapidly
changing hormone levels

37:03.090 --> 37:05.310
from affecting the
underlying skin layer.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.834
- What inspired you
to start this brand?

37:07.964 --> 37:09.052
- After I had my baby,

37:09.183 --> 37:11.794
I had a facial acne problem

37:11.925 --> 37:13.753
for the first time in my life.

37:13.883 --> 37:15.320
Um, and the skincare company

37:15.450 --> 37:16.973
that I had at that time

37:17.104 --> 37:18.410
developed a product
to help women

37:18.540 --> 37:20.063
with this exact same problem.

37:20.194 --> 37:22.370
But, after we started marketing,

37:22.501 --> 37:24.938
we found out that the side
effects to those products

37:25.068 --> 37:27.506
were far worse than the acne.

37:27.636 --> 37:31.205
Some of the women's skin
would either itch or burn,

37:31.336 --> 37:34.208
and eventually we found out
some of the chemicals we used

37:34.339 --> 37:37.255
could actually
cause skin cancer.

37:37.385 --> 37:38.995
It was a nightmare.

37:39.126 --> 37:42.347
So I just, I just
really wanna help women

37:42.477 --> 37:46.089
by giving them products that
were safe and effective.

37:46.220 --> 37:48.875
- Your passion is what's
gonna help sell your product.

37:50.572 --> 37:52.182
That's the strategy
that we start with.

37:52.313 --> 37:54.097
We bring your
personal connection-

37:54.228 --> 37:56.361
- Oh, um, I- I- I don't wanna
be in any of the videos,

37:56.491 --> 37:58.580
or, or pictures.

37:58.711 --> 38:02.454
- Well, typically we see
the best response to brands

38:02.584 --> 38:04.064
when there's a familiar
face behind it.

38:04.194 --> 38:06.022
It's a way to
personalize the company.

38:06.153 --> 38:08.808
- I would prefer
if I wasn't in it.

38:08.938 --> 38:10.070
I think the brand name alone

38:10.200 --> 38:12.855
and what it gives to
people is more than enough.

38:12.986 --> 38:14.117
I mean, if, if, if
that's an issue,

38:14.248 --> 38:17.382
I can just, I can just go
find another PR company.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.907
Did something happen?

38:21.037 --> 38:22.865
- I am sure that we
can find a way to, to-

38:22.996 --> 38:24.476
- I looked up your
previous company,

38:24.606 --> 38:25.607
the one that you had
with your husband?

38:25.738 --> 38:29.785
- Ex-husband, and, and
what does that have to do

38:29.916 --> 38:31.309
with, with anything?

38:31.439 --> 38:35.051
- I saw that you had some legal
trouble with that company.

38:35.182 --> 38:37.358
I know what it's like
to wanna start over.

38:37.489 --> 38:41.275
I think that you start
with being honest

38:41.406 --> 38:43.451
about your past mistakes.

38:43.582 --> 38:46.846
Look, in a world where
everything is photoshopped,

38:46.976 --> 38:50.066
where people are
constantly posting online

38:50.197 --> 38:52.504
about how happy they are when
they're really miserable,

38:54.375 --> 38:56.072
people are looking
for authenticity.

38:56.203 --> 38:58.031
I know I am.

38:58.161 --> 39:00.294
If you're honest about
your past mistakes

39:00.990 --> 39:02.644
and that Aurora
Botanicals is your way

39:02.775 --> 39:08.171
of helping women feel better
about their real selves,

39:08.302 --> 39:10.043
I think you can build your brand

39:10.173 --> 39:13.046
and gain back some of
your previous clientele.

39:14.656 --> 39:17.050
Build back that trust
that you have with them.

39:17.180 --> 39:20.923
- Yes, but my ex-husband
ran our previous company

39:21.054 --> 39:22.098
into the ground.

39:22.229 --> 39:24.187
We were sued by so many clients.

39:24.318 --> 39:28.061
Look, I, ah, I just really
want you guys to run PR

39:28.191 --> 39:29.497
and make sure that my name

39:29.628 --> 39:31.543
is kept out of the
new, new brand.

39:33.240 --> 39:34.937
- I think we should
do the opposite.

39:35.068 --> 39:37.113
Like Emily said,

39:37.244 --> 39:40.116
your clients are going to
want to connect with you.

39:40.247 --> 39:42.380
When they hear you speak
honestly about your story,

39:44.033 --> 39:45.339
they'll see your dedication.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.167
We've all made mistakes.

39:47.297 --> 39:50.257
I know I have.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.998
And it's hard.

39:52.128 --> 39:53.913
It's scary to put
yourself out there,

39:54.043 --> 39:57.395
but you owe it not just to
your clients, but to yourself.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.880
- You really think
they'll react positively.

40:06.316 --> 40:07.970
- I think so.

40:08.101 --> 40:09.145
- We can walk you
through the steps

40:09.276 --> 40:10.451
of what that would look like

40:10.582 --> 40:12.192
so you can get
comfortable with it all.

40:12.322 --> 40:14.107
- And you guys have
really helped restore

40:14.237 --> 40:15.500
other people's reputations?

40:15.630 --> 40:17.371
- Yes, many.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.417
It's one of the aspects
of this job I like most.

40:23.333 --> 40:24.465
All right.

40:27.294 --> 40:28.991
- We'll talk to the
rest of the team

40:29.122 --> 40:31.037
and we'll send a proposal
over to you soon.

40:31.167 --> 40:33.169
- I look forward to
working with both of you.

40:34.344 --> 40:35.520
- Can I talk to you in
my office for a second?

40:35.650 --> 40:37.957
- Sure.

40:38.087 --> 40:39.654
- I, uh, I wanna apologize.

40:39.785 --> 40:41.482
We clearly got off
on the wrong foot.

40:41.613 --> 40:43.179
My only intention
was to protect Emily,

40:43.310 --> 40:45.051
but I hope we can
put that behind us

40:45.181 --> 40:47.140
now that I hear you're,
uh, joining the team.

40:48.315 --> 40:49.838
- All right, thank you.

40:49.969 --> 40:50.535
- Yeah.

40:54.103 --> 40:55.148
- That was nice.

40:57.237 --> 40:58.804
- Don't feel bad for him.

40:58.934 --> 41:00.545
He made his bed, now
he has to lie in it.

41:05.724 --> 41:06.638
Thanks for letting me
be part of the meeting today.

41:06.768 --> 41:09.554
- Of course. You did a good job.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.992
- Maybe I can do the
next one by myself.

41:14.994 --> 41:15.037
- Ah.

41:15.864 --> 41:18.519
- I mean, if you think.

41:18.650 --> 41:21.087
- Like I said, Lily,
you did a good job,

41:21.217 --> 41:23.655
but there's just so much
more to learn and experience

41:23.785 --> 41:27.006
before handling an entire
portfolio by yourself.

41:27.136 --> 41:29.487
- Right. Totally understandable.

41:33.055 --> 41:34.361
You done?

41:34.492 --> 41:36.494
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you, Mommy.

41:38.408 --> 41:40.149
- You okay?
- Yeah.

41:42.891 --> 41:45.154
You're not
still mad at me, are you?

41:45.285 --> 41:47.330
- No, of course not.

41:47.461 --> 41:50.595
- You get like I do when you're
hyper-focused on something.

41:50.725 --> 41:53.293
You just laser in and
drown everything else out.

41:55.077 --> 41:57.036
- I'm thinking about Kyle.

41:57.166 --> 41:58.472
- Anything I can do to help?

41:58.603 --> 42:00.300
- Mm, turn back time?

42:02.650 --> 42:05.348
- Well, while I get on that,

42:05.479 --> 42:08.438
how about I put Nina to bed

42:08.569 --> 42:11.137
and you can get some much
needed relaxation time.

42:11.267 --> 42:12.181
- That would be great.

42:20.450 --> 42:23.671
- The fox leaped up and
grabbed onto the branch.

42:23.802 --> 42:27.022
"Just like this," said the fox,

42:27.153 --> 42:27.936
and then the two of them-

42:28.067 --> 42:28.720
- Lily?

42:29.764 --> 42:31.505
- Yeah?

42:31.636 --> 42:33.507
- Is my daddy going to
come back to stay here?

42:36.292 --> 42:37.685
- I don't know, sweetie.

42:37.816 --> 42:39.600
That's up to your
mommy and daddy.

42:39.731 --> 42:42.298
- I miss when he
used to live here.

42:42.429 --> 42:44.126
They fight a lot now.

42:44.257 --> 42:46.564
I don't
want them to be sad.

42:46.694 --> 42:48.478
- I know exactly how you feel.

42:48.609 --> 42:50.437
- You do?

42:50.568 --> 42:53.048
- Mm-hmm, my parents
used to fight a lot.

42:53.179 --> 42:54.528
- Why did they fight?

42:54.659 --> 42:55.442
- I don't know.

42:57.792 --> 42:59.533
I was around your
age when it happened.

43:01.187 --> 43:01.753
But you know what?

43:04.494 --> 43:08.411
I will always be here
for you no matter what.

43:09.456 --> 43:10.370
I promise.

43:59.637 --> 44:02.335
Help!

44:06.731 --> 44:08.689
- I don't understand.
What happened?

44:08.820 --> 44:09.821
- It sounds like you
were electrocuted.

44:09.951 --> 44:11.866
- What?

44:11.997 --> 44:13.694
- Electrocuted?

44:13.825 --> 44:15.348
Maybe
there's a loose wire.

44:15.478 --> 44:16.218
It can't happen.

44:17.480 --> 44:18.394
- Oh. Here's the.

44:19.439 --> 44:20.396
Thank you.

44:32.408 --> 44:34.019
- Shouldn't you be resting?

44:34.149 --> 44:36.238
- I feel a little weak,
but I can handle it.

44:38.980 --> 44:41.635
Wow, look at you, all ready
and dressed for school.

44:43.506 --> 44:45.857
- Are you sure you don't
wanna take today off?

44:45.987 --> 44:47.902
- No, there's too much
to do at the office.

44:51.863 --> 44:53.734
- Nina, I think your
mom is Superwoman.

44:55.649 --> 44:57.346
Wanna
head out in five?

44:57.477 --> 44:58.521
Sure, let
me grab my bag.

44:58.652 --> 44:59.653
I'll be right there.

45:03.570 --> 45:04.397
- Hey.

45:09.054 --> 45:11.230
I know that last night was
probably pretty scary for you,

45:11.360 --> 45:12.187
but I'm okay.

45:14.015 --> 45:16.235
- Why did Grandma and
Grandpa hurt Lily?

45:16.365 --> 45:17.845
- What do you mean?

45:17.976 --> 45:20.630
- Lily said they
weren't nice to her.

45:20.761 --> 45:22.241
- When did she say that?

45:22.371 --> 45:23.590
- Last night.

45:30.466 --> 45:31.293
- Yes, Cassie?

45:32.468 --> 45:33.426
- Get in there.

45:33.556 --> 45:34.340
- What?
- Now!

45:35.689 --> 45:36.516
- Okay.

45:40.999 --> 45:43.044
- I saw you in
town the other day.

45:43.175 --> 45:44.785
- Okay?

45:44.916 --> 45:45.830
- I know that the law
office you were visiting

45:45.960 --> 45:48.267
handles divorce cases.

45:48.397 --> 45:49.921
Emily is my best friend

45:50.051 --> 45:51.357
and I don't wanna see
her get hurt anymore.

45:51.487 --> 45:52.837
- I don't mean to be rude,

45:52.967 --> 45:54.795
but my marriage is
none of your business.

45:54.926 --> 45:56.928
- I can't keep this from her.

45:57.058 --> 45:58.886
I'm giving you the
chance to tell her first.

45:59.017 --> 45:59.931
- Are you giving
me an ultimatum?

46:11.812 --> 46:12.770
- Everything all right?

46:12.900 --> 46:13.727
- Yeah.

46:15.642 --> 46:16.643
- Cassie, I was thinking

46:16.774 --> 46:18.297
that you could help show Lily

46:18.427 --> 46:20.516
how we prepare for
client pitches today.

46:20.647 --> 46:22.301
- Of course. Let's do it.

46:25.608 --> 46:26.740
- Can you get me the
number for the guy

46:26.871 --> 46:28.394
that you sent to
fix the hot tub?

46:28.524 --> 46:29.656
Did it break again?

46:29.787 --> 46:31.919
- No, he left a live wire inside

46:32.050 --> 46:33.529
and it electrocuted
me last night.

46:33.660 --> 46:35.314
- What? Are you okay?

46:35.444 --> 46:36.750
- Can you just
get me the number?

46:38.273 --> 46:40.275
- Okay, Em, please.

46:42.016 --> 46:43.975
Em, can we talk?
- No.

46:46.542 --> 46:50.155
- It is way too early for
Lily to be taking clients.

46:50.285 --> 46:52.897
- Kyle, I don't
wanna talk right now.

46:53.027 --> 46:55.682
I need space to process
everything that has happened.

46:57.205 --> 46:58.859
- We have to talk
about it eventually.

46:58.990 --> 47:00.339
- Then I will let you
know when eventually is.

47:03.603 --> 47:05.474
- Can we at least
talk about work.

47:05.605 --> 47:07.694
- If it's unrelated
to Lily, sure.

47:07.825 --> 47:10.915
- Okay. So, um, what's
going on with Viator?

47:11.045 --> 47:12.525
Have you signed paperwork
for partnering with them yet?

47:12.655 --> 47:13.700
Not yet.

47:13.831 --> 47:15.658
- Well, I think the
company should meet them

47:15.789 --> 47:17.530
and then we should
all discuss it.

47:17.660 --> 47:19.662
- I totally agree.

47:19.793 --> 47:21.012
That's why I invited them
to the anniversary party

47:21.142 --> 47:22.665
so you can have your
chance to ask them

47:22.796 --> 47:23.841
whatever questions
you want then.

47:50.041 --> 47:50.868
Ah.

48:07.754 --> 48:08.798
- How long will it take?

48:08.929 --> 48:09.887
- Shouldn't take long.

48:12.106 --> 48:13.847
It's urgent.

48:13.978 --> 48:15.457
It always is.

48:19.157 --> 48:20.767
- We work hard because we care.

48:20.898 --> 48:21.811
In a world where authenticity

48:21.942 --> 48:23.248
is becoming
increasingly more rare,

48:23.378 --> 48:27.643
we wanna be the public
relations firm you can trust.

48:27.774 --> 48:29.689
Here at Viator, we work
one-on-one with brands,

48:29.819 --> 48:30.995
big and small.

48:31.125 --> 48:32.692
We know what it's like

48:32.822 --> 48:33.562
to work your business
from the ground up

48:33.693 --> 48:34.999
and also what it's like

48:35.129 --> 48:36.652
to keep your already-successful
business afloat-

48:36.783 --> 48:38.089
- Nina's asleep.

48:38.219 --> 48:39.742
In this
highly competitive time.

48:39.873 --> 48:41.919
- Still burning
the midnight oil?

48:42.049 --> 48:45.618
The company that
I want to partner with,

48:45.748 --> 48:48.795
they redid their website, so
I was just checking it out.

48:48.926 --> 48:49.752
- Viator, right?

48:49.883 --> 48:51.624
- Yeah.

48:51.754 --> 48:52.668
I know some people at
work are apprehensive

48:52.799 --> 48:56.672
about this change, but
I feel good about it.

49:01.634 --> 49:02.852
I can't tell you how great it is

49:02.983 --> 49:04.550
to have someone helping me.

49:04.680 --> 49:06.421
Thank you so much, Lily.

49:06.552 --> 49:08.075
- Of course. It's
what family's for.

49:08.206 --> 49:10.382
So I've heard.

49:12.732 --> 49:14.995
I would suggest a relaxing
dip in the hot tub,

49:15.126 --> 49:18.651
but I imagine that's
off limits for a while.

49:18.781 --> 49:21.349
- Hm, I never wanna go
in that thing again.

49:21.480 --> 49:22.611
- Fair enough.

49:24.309 --> 49:27.660
- There was something that I-
I wanted to talk to you about.

49:27.790 --> 49:28.835
- What's up?

49:28.966 --> 49:31.707
- Um, well, you know, the day

49:31.838 --> 49:33.709
that I went to the storage unit?

49:35.842 --> 49:38.714
I went there because I was
hoping to find something

49:38.845 --> 49:41.456
that might tell me more
about why you were sent away.

49:43.067 --> 49:45.025
I just, I needed
to know for myself.

49:46.766 --> 49:48.246
And I found this
article that my,

49:48.376 --> 49:52.163
our parents had saved, uh,

49:52.293 --> 49:55.862
about a family car accident
that paralyzed a woman.

49:59.518 --> 50:02.869
- I'm sorry, we haven't
talked about this before.

50:03.913 --> 50:07.743
I guess I- I was afraid
to tell you the truth.

50:09.658 --> 50:10.181
- The truth?

50:15.534 --> 50:16.230
- It was my fault.

50:18.972 --> 50:20.582
I'm the reason
she was paralyzed.

50:26.936 --> 50:28.808
- What do you mean, you
caused the accident?

50:30.114 --> 50:32.116
- There was a,

50:32.246 --> 50:34.640
an event that we were all
supposed to go to one night.

50:37.208 --> 50:37.947
I didn't wanna go,

50:40.037 --> 50:43.562
so we were fighting
on the front porch.

50:45.999 --> 50:48.697
It was winter. The
steps were icy.

50:53.093 --> 50:55.704
And I pushed her away from
me and I ran back inside.

50:58.490 --> 51:00.883
And she, she slipped.

51:01.014 --> 51:02.711
She fell all the
way down the stairs.

51:04.887 --> 51:08.239
Right, right as our father was
pulling around to pick us up.

51:09.240 --> 51:10.502
He tried to stop.

51:12.286 --> 51:14.810
But he, she fell right
in front of the car.

51:15.898 --> 51:18.814
It was too late.

51:18.945 --> 51:20.773
I didn't mean to hurt her,

51:22.905 --> 51:24.864
but she blamed me.

51:24.994 --> 51:25.778
When, when the boarding
facility came to pick me up,

51:25.908 --> 51:28.607
she didn't even come
out to say goodbye.

51:32.828 --> 51:34.613
That was the last
time I ever saw her.

51:36.093 --> 51:38.051
I'm sorry I never said anything.

51:38.182 --> 51:42.360
I- I don't think I've ever
shared that with anyone before.

51:42.490 --> 51:45.276
- I'm so sorry that all of
that happened to you, I.

51:48.844 --> 51:50.629
- I tried to visit you once.

51:50.759 --> 51:53.849
- Really? When?

51:53.980 --> 51:55.286
- Right after I graduated.

51:56.852 --> 51:58.202
I wanted to confront them

51:58.332 --> 52:00.595
and I thought maybe
we could be a family.

52:02.423 --> 52:04.817
When I drove by, I- I
saw the three of you.

52:07.254 --> 52:08.864
You looked so happy.

52:12.564 --> 52:14.131
I couldn't do it.
I chickened out.

52:15.871 --> 52:16.916
I was too scared.

52:19.701 --> 52:21.877
- Why did you decide
to come back now?

52:23.444 --> 52:25.142
- I always felt like I
was missing something.

52:28.362 --> 52:30.756
Everybody always had
something I didn't.

52:30.886 --> 52:34.151
A family, and I
wanted one so badly.

52:36.153 --> 52:38.155
When I heard our parents
died, I thought maybe,

52:39.939 --> 52:41.114
I thought maybe
you could love me.

52:41.245 --> 52:42.942
- You know, I- I've always felt

52:43.072 --> 52:44.770
like there was
something missing too.

52:46.380 --> 52:47.773
I'm really grateful
that we were able

52:47.903 --> 52:48.904
to find our way
back to one another.

52:56.173 --> 53:00.655
Do you think all of these
things going on are weird?

53:04.529 --> 53:06.444
- Almost getting
electrocuted in a hot tub

53:06.574 --> 53:08.881
is like one-in-a-million.

53:09.011 --> 53:10.099
It's beyond weird.

53:10.230 --> 53:11.275
- Should I be worried?

53:12.537 --> 53:14.365
- Worried about what, exactly?

53:14.495 --> 53:16.932
- I don't know, that
they're related somehow?

53:18.369 --> 53:20.197
That's an absurd thought, right?

53:21.981 --> 53:22.982
- You're just under
a lot of stress.

53:24.026 --> 53:24.940
It'll all be okay.

53:28.074 --> 53:29.249
This is just a rough patch.

53:32.731 --> 53:37.083
- So how long have you been
experiencing any dizziness?

53:37.214 --> 53:38.127
- A few days.

53:38.258 --> 53:39.912
- Any loss of eyesight?

53:40.042 --> 53:42.436
Any tingling sensation
in your arms or legs?

53:42.567 --> 53:44.960
- No.
- What about memory?

53:45.091 --> 53:47.180
Huh, you been having
trouble remembering things?

53:48.268 --> 53:48.834
- No.

53:48.964 --> 53:51.967
- That's good news. Huh?

53:52.098 --> 53:53.795
Just sounds like stress fatigue.

53:53.926 --> 53:54.927
No concussion from the attack.

53:55.057 --> 53:57.495
No nerve damage from
the electrocution.

53:57.625 --> 54:00.106
- Oh wait, Ms. Caldwell.

54:02.413 --> 54:04.502
There was a problem
with your credit card.

54:04.632 --> 54:05.807
Do you have another one?

54:07.983 --> 54:09.333
- That can't be right.

54:09.463 --> 54:11.291
I've
tried it multiple times.

54:14.033 --> 54:14.816
- Here.

54:36.577 --> 54:39.058
The Aurora
client is on line one.

54:40.451 --> 54:41.495
- Okay, thank you.

54:44.933 --> 54:46.239
Hi. Is everything okay?

54:48.023 --> 54:49.329
I just
received your proposal

54:49.460 --> 54:51.897
and it's not at all
what we discussed.

54:52.027 --> 54:53.768
- Uh, hold on.

54:56.249 --> 54:57.294
Are you there?

54:57.424 --> 54:59.296
- Yes, I'm so sorry.

54:59.426 --> 55:00.514
I- I just got into the
office a few minutes ago.

55:00.645 --> 55:02.299
I'm looking at the document now.

55:02.429 --> 55:04.997
I don't know why it was
sent out this morning.

55:05.127 --> 55:06.346
I
was caught by surprise

55:06.477 --> 55:08.957
and frankly, I'm a little upset.

55:09.088 --> 55:10.002
- I understand, I would be too.

55:10.132 --> 55:13.484
I am very sorry. I
did not approve this.

55:13.614 --> 55:15.399
We will get it
straightened out right away

55:15.529 --> 55:18.053
and we'll send over the
proposal that we talked about.

55:18.184 --> 55:20.186
All right, thank you.

55:24.712 --> 55:25.496
- Why was the Aurora proposal
sent out this morning

55:25.626 --> 55:28.150
without my approval?

55:28.281 --> 55:31.240
- Oh, I- Lily said
you okayed it.

55:31.371 --> 55:33.982
- What? Where is she?

55:34.113 --> 55:35.114
Uh, I don't.

55:45.298 --> 55:47.300
- Can I talk to
you for a minute?

55:47.431 --> 55:48.867
- Is- is everything okay?

55:48.997 --> 55:50.347
- No, it's not.

55:50.477 --> 55:52.261
Cassie just said that
you approved a document

55:52.392 --> 55:55.221
that went out to the
Aurora client this morning.

55:55.352 --> 55:57.092
We had discussed-

55:57.223 --> 55:58.485
- We never discussed it.

55:58.616 --> 56:00.226
I talked about how to set it up

56:00.357 --> 56:02.184
if you were the one doing it,

56:02.315 --> 56:03.229
but I never said that you
could approve a document

56:03.360 --> 56:05.536
and send it out to
one of our clients.

56:05.666 --> 56:08.321
- I thought that since my
initial meeting with her

56:08.452 --> 56:11.063
went so well, it would be okay.

56:11.193 --> 56:13.544
- We could potentially lose
them as a client over this.

56:16.547 --> 56:17.896
- I'm sorry.

56:42.747 --> 56:43.400
Come in.

56:48.317 --> 56:50.145
- I've had a strange
morning, Marty.

56:50.276 --> 56:53.148
- Oh dear. How can I help?

56:53.279 --> 56:55.455
- I was hoping you could
keep this between us.

56:55.586 --> 56:56.369
- Of course.

57:00.373 --> 57:03.028
- There's money missing
from two of my accounts.

57:03.158 --> 57:05.030
- What do you mean missing?

57:05.160 --> 57:07.206
- I checked both my personal
and my business account

57:07.336 --> 57:08.642
and there's a chunk
of money missing.

57:08.773 --> 57:12.080
- Well, that is very concerning.

57:12.211 --> 57:14.474
- If they were withdrawals
and I didn't okay them,

57:14.605 --> 57:16.302
then that means someone
forged my signature.

57:16.433 --> 57:17.477
- Let's not jump to conclusions.

57:17.608 --> 57:19.566
I'm sure there's an explanation.

57:19.697 --> 57:21.307
Did you look to see what
specific withdrawals

57:21.438 --> 57:22.743
were made in the last few weeks?

57:22.874 --> 57:24.136
- I was going to do that today,

57:24.266 --> 57:25.790
but now I have to put out a
fire with the Aurora client.

57:25.920 --> 57:29.097
So I was wondering if
you could look into it

57:29.228 --> 57:30.229
while I handle that.

57:30.359 --> 57:32.318
- Absolutely. Absolutely.

57:32.449 --> 57:33.232
- Thank you.

57:39.499 --> 57:41.458
- So this is our three
different color arrangement.

57:41.588 --> 57:43.460
You said the event was at
the yacht club, correct?

57:43.590 --> 57:45.287
- Mm-hmm.

57:45.418 --> 57:46.114
- We can also do
a nautical theme.

57:47.464 --> 57:49.204
- Uh, well, we want
something celebratory,

57:49.335 --> 57:50.249
but a little more elegant.

57:50.379 --> 57:52.207
- Of course. We've
got several options.

57:52.338 --> 57:53.600
Why don't we start over here?

58:00.302 --> 58:01.173
- This one.

58:02.391 --> 58:04.959
- Lilies. Mom's favorite.

58:10.138 --> 58:11.009
- I'm sorry.

58:12.489 --> 58:13.141
- I'm sorry.

58:14.186 --> 58:16.362
I should have
asked you about it.

58:16.493 --> 58:17.406
I don't know what
I was thinking.

58:17.537 --> 58:19.539
I- I guess I just,

58:19.670 --> 58:21.498
I really thought that
you would approve it.

58:23.238 --> 58:25.197
I wanted you to
know I could do it.

58:25.327 --> 58:27.199
- I'm pretty particular
about the proposals.

58:30.507 --> 58:31.551
- Is it fixable?

58:31.682 --> 58:32.465
- I think so.

58:34.554 --> 58:38.079
It's just, there's so
much that's been going on,

58:38.210 --> 58:40.560
and then I got that call
from the Aurora client

58:40.691 --> 58:44.390
and it was the last straw
with all the stress.

58:44.521 --> 58:46.261
I didn't mean to
take it out on you.

58:46.392 --> 58:48.481
- I- I want you to
know I'm here for you.

58:49.700 --> 58:51.310
- I don't know what to do, Lily.

58:51.440 --> 58:54.443
I'm, I'm so confused
about everything.

58:54.574 --> 58:56.576
I feel like I'm going crazy.

58:56.707 --> 58:59.231
- We can figure it out together.

59:01.407 --> 59:02.843
- Sorry to interrupt,

59:02.974 --> 59:04.628
but it's for sure
the lilies, then?

59:05.759 --> 59:07.413
Yes.

59:07.544 --> 59:09.284
Great.

59:14.202 --> 59:15.595
- Where's Nina?

59:15.726 --> 59:16.509
Nina! Nina!

59:27.215 --> 59:28.086
- Hello?

59:50.195 --> 59:50.761
Hello?

1:01:04.791 --> 1:01:05.662
- Nina?

1:01:06.706 --> 1:01:07.533
Nina? Nina!

1:01:19.458 --> 1:01:21.155
Nina!

1:01:27.509 --> 1:01:28.989
Oh, thank God.

1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:30.251
You can't just
take off like that.

1:01:30.382 --> 1:01:31.644
We didn't know where you were!

1:01:31.775 --> 1:01:32.776
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1:01:34.255 --> 1:01:34.299
I'm sorry.

1:01:35.909 --> 1:01:36.954
- It's okay, sweetie.

1:01:43.787 --> 1:01:45.310
- Kyle, I can't talk right now!

1:01:46.833 --> 1:01:48.487
What? What happened?

1:01:55.407 --> 1:01:56.669
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.

1:01:56.800 --> 1:01:58.236
How are you?
- Where is she?

1:01:58.366 --> 1:01:59.454
- She's just inside.
She's just inside.

1:01:59.585 --> 1:02:00.499
You wanna go play?
- Yeah.

1:02:00.629 --> 1:02:04.242
All right. All
right.

1:02:12.337 --> 1:02:13.468
- Kyle.

1:02:13.599 --> 1:02:14.731
- Please just leave me alone.

1:02:16.123 --> 1:02:18.865
Hey, can we play?
- Ah-huh.

1:02:18.996 --> 1:02:20.388
- Who can I be?
- This one.

1:02:20.519 --> 1:02:22.347
- Oh yeah? Does this one?

1:02:22.477 --> 1:02:23.827
What happened?

1:02:23.957 --> 1:02:26.525
- The back door was locked,

1:02:28.701 --> 1:02:31.748
so I took the stairs
and I tripped.

1:02:33.619 --> 1:02:34.576
Saying it's an accident,

1:02:34.707 --> 1:02:38.755
but I saw someone
in the stairwell.

1:02:38.885 --> 1:02:40.408
- What?

1:02:40.539 --> 1:02:42.759
- Mm.
- Did you call security?

1:02:42.889 --> 1:02:44.804
- Yeah.

1:02:44.935 --> 1:02:47.720
They're saying that it was
probably the building janitor,

1:02:47.851 --> 1:02:49.896
since he's the one who found me.

1:02:50.027 --> 1:02:51.637
- Do you think
someone pushed you?

1:02:51.768 --> 1:02:55.467
- I do remember
tripping on the stairs.

1:02:55.597 --> 1:02:57.774
Told the janitor that
I felt something,

1:02:57.904 --> 1:02:58.949
but when he checked,

1:03:00.559 --> 1:03:01.778
he said there wasn't anything.

1:03:04.955 --> 1:03:09.742
But, Emily, something
just doesn't feel right.

1:03:11.265 --> 1:03:14.051
- I- I'm canceling
the anniversary party.

1:03:14.181 --> 1:03:16.488
- What? No, don't do that.

1:03:16.618 --> 1:03:18.925
- Cassie, you're in
the emergency room

1:03:19.056 --> 1:03:21.406
and everything that's happened
to me the last couple weeks.

1:03:21.536 --> 1:03:23.669
- You've been planning
this for months.

1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:25.062
I know what this means to you.

1:03:26.498 --> 1:03:27.194
If you cancel this because me,

1:03:27.325 --> 1:03:30.328
I would just feel more awful.

1:03:30.458 --> 1:03:32.417
- Cass.
- Please.

1:03:33.592 --> 1:03:37.770
Okay, I- I won't
cancel it.

1:03:39.206 --> 1:03:40.077
- Well, there's,
there's something else

1:03:40.207 --> 1:03:42.427
I wanted to tell you.

1:03:42.557 --> 1:03:43.689
- Cassie.
- But it's-

1:03:43.820 --> 1:03:45.082
- How are you feeling?

1:03:49.173 --> 1:03:49.913
Mm.

1:03:58.051 --> 1:03:59.400
Mommy, you're so pretty.

1:03:59.531 --> 1:04:01.925
Oh, you look beautiful.

1:04:03.491 --> 1:04:04.014
- Thank you.

1:04:07.495 --> 1:04:09.323
- This is the
fanciest thing I own.

1:04:09.454 --> 1:04:09.976
Do you think it's okay?

1:04:10.107 --> 1:04:11.848
- Hold on.

1:04:13.023 --> 1:04:14.459
I have just the thing for you.

1:04:15.982 --> 1:04:17.375
It was our mother's.

1:04:17.505 --> 1:04:18.593
- Oh, I don't think-

1:04:18.724 --> 1:04:19.986
- I want you to have it.

1:04:23.033 --> 1:04:26.906
Here, and you'd be
silly not to wear it

1:04:27.037 --> 1:04:29.474
because it goes perfectly
with your dress.

1:04:29.604 --> 1:04:30.649
Here, let me help you.

1:04:36.220 --> 1:04:37.874
- I love it.

1:04:41.225 --> 1:04:43.792
Are you okay?

1:04:43.923 --> 1:04:44.837
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1:04:44.968 --> 1:04:46.970
I'm just thinking about Cassie.

1:04:49.059 --> 1:04:51.061
We should take
a picture for her.

1:04:53.106 --> 1:04:54.716
You have my phone? Great.

1:04:54.847 --> 1:04:55.674
Okay.

1:05:38.499 --> 1:05:39.109
- Hi. Hey.

1:05:45.071 --> 1:05:46.464
- Speech.
- Okay.

1:05:50.816 --> 1:05:52.992
- Thank you all for coming.

1:05:53.123 --> 1:05:55.212
This milestone, it
means so much to me,

1:05:55.342 --> 1:05:58.171
and it, and it would've
meant so much to my parents.

1:05:58.302 --> 1:06:00.304
Six years ago we lost my father,

1:06:00.434 --> 1:06:04.221
and a year after that,
we lost my mother.

1:06:04.351 --> 1:06:08.051
They built this company
together from the ground up.

1:06:08.181 --> 1:06:10.227
I practically grew
up at the offices.

1:06:12.403 --> 1:06:14.709
I remember asking my parents
why they started this company,

1:06:14.840 --> 1:06:17.060
and they said that it
made them feel proud

1:06:17.190 --> 1:06:19.801
to help other people's
businesses become successful.

1:06:21.890 --> 1:06:23.805
I find it very difficult
to fill my parents' shoes,

1:06:23.936 --> 1:06:26.069
but with the help
of all of you, I,

1:06:26.199 --> 1:06:28.897
I feel so blessed to be able
to continue their legacy.

1:06:29.028 --> 1:06:32.205
So thank you so much for
all of your hard work

1:06:32.336 --> 1:06:36.035
and dedication, it, it
means the world to me.

1:06:40.083 --> 1:06:43.173
And lastly, uh, a
few weeks ago, I,

1:06:43.303 --> 1:06:46.741
I got the most
wonderful surprise.

1:06:46.872 --> 1:06:48.700
And that was finding out

1:06:48.830 --> 1:06:51.181
that I had a sibling I
never even knew existed.

1:06:53.400 --> 1:06:56.099
I'm very happy to have my
sister Lily in my life now

1:06:56.229 --> 1:06:57.926
and even more proud

1:06:58.057 --> 1:07:00.146
that she's the newest
member of Caldwell PR.

1:07:02.757 --> 1:07:04.194
So thank you everyone.

1:07:04.324 --> 1:07:08.328
Please enjoy tonight,
and yeah, thank you.

1:07:11.201 --> 1:07:12.245
How did I do?
- Fantastic.

1:07:12.376 --> 1:07:14.117
- Thank you.

1:07:16.728 --> 1:07:18.512
- Great speech.
- Mm, huh.

1:07:20.210 --> 1:07:21.776
- Would you mind if
I had a moment alone?

1:07:21.907 --> 1:07:23.126
- No, of course.
- Yeah?

1:07:23.256 --> 1:07:25.258
- I'll see you.

1:07:25.389 --> 1:07:26.216
- You were right.

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:29.958
- What did you find?

1:07:30.089 --> 1:07:31.612
- There is some odd activity
in one of the accounts.

1:07:31.743 --> 1:07:33.179
It's all in here.

1:07:33.310 --> 1:07:34.659
There's been some
cash withdrawals.

1:07:34.789 --> 1:07:36.139
All in the last two weeks.

1:07:36.269 --> 1:07:37.792
- Why didn't our
accountants catch it?

1:07:37.923 --> 1:07:39.794
- They're small sums,

1:07:39.925 --> 1:07:41.100
so they'd go under the radar
of anything substantial,

1:07:41.231 --> 1:07:42.841
but they add up.

1:07:44.364 --> 1:07:45.278
- I don't know what
these withdrawals are.

1:07:45.409 --> 1:07:46.758
I didn't approve any of them.

1:07:46.888 --> 1:07:48.412
- I'm sorry, Em,

1:07:48.542 --> 1:07:50.283
it's not the best time
to tell you all this,

1:07:50.414 --> 1:07:51.893
but I wanted to tell you
sooner rather than later.

1:07:52.024 --> 1:07:52.764
- No, it's okay.
Thank you, Marty.

1:07:52.894 --> 1:07:53.591
I appreciate it.

1:08:02.165 --> 1:08:03.122
Can I talk to you for a second?

1:08:03.253 --> 1:08:04.080
- Okay.

1:08:05.733 --> 1:08:07.387
What is going on?

1:08:07.518 --> 1:08:10.347
- Did you forge my signature
on accounts to withdraw money?

1:08:10.477 --> 1:08:12.088
- I can't believe you even
asked me that question.

1:08:12.218 --> 1:08:13.785
- Well, it's not that
far of a stretch for you.

1:08:13.915 --> 1:08:15.047
- That's unfair.

1:08:15.178 --> 1:08:16.135
- Are you telling me the truth?

1:08:16.265 --> 1:08:17.832
- Yes, of course.

1:08:17.962 --> 1:08:18.964
And I'm just curious,

1:08:19.094 --> 1:08:20.879
are you gonna ask Lily
this question too?

1:08:21.009 --> 1:08:22.836
- What does this
have to do with Lily?

1:08:22.968 --> 1:08:25.013
What do you have against
her? I don't get it.

1:08:25.144 --> 1:08:26.362
- Ever since she showed up,

1:08:26.493 --> 1:08:28.191
a lot of things
have been happening.

1:08:28.321 --> 1:08:30.236
- I've been thinking
about that too.

1:08:30.367 --> 1:08:31.759
Maybe somebody's doing all this

1:08:31.889 --> 1:08:33.413
to make it look like
it could be her.

1:08:33.544 --> 1:08:36.023
- Okay. If you're-
- Hi, sorry,

1:08:36.155 --> 1:08:38.157
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1:08:38.288 --> 1:08:39.767
- Not at all.

1:08:39.898 --> 1:08:41.246
I'm so happy you could make it

1:08:41.378 --> 1:08:42.814
and to finally
meet you in person.

1:08:42.943 --> 1:08:44.207
- Yeah, likewise.

1:08:44.336 --> 1:08:45.991
Uh, Thomas Viator.
- Hi.

1:08:46.121 --> 1:08:47.558
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

1:08:47.688 --> 1:08:49.995
I guess we will talk
about this later.

1:08:53.172 --> 1:08:55.000
I was, uh,
really moved by your speech.

1:08:55.130 --> 1:08:56.827
Oh.

1:08:56.958 --> 1:08:58.046
- Viator's been in
my family for years.

1:08:58.176 --> 1:08:59.612
It's, it's a lot of pressure
carrying on a legacy.

1:08:59.744 --> 1:09:01.137
- It is.

1:09:02.877 --> 1:09:05.792
I am constantly second
guessing myself.

1:09:05.924 --> 1:09:07.404
How do you handle
all the pressure?

1:09:07.533 --> 1:09:10.233
One day at a time.

1:09:10.362 --> 1:09:12.235
Maybe some naive
confidence I've gotten

1:09:12.365 --> 1:09:13.932
from obstacles before,

1:09:14.062 --> 1:09:15.846
and I know I can get
through it again.

1:09:17.978 --> 1:09:18.327
- Well, thank you
for coming out.

1:09:18.458 --> 1:09:21.026
- Yeah.

1:09:21.157 --> 1:09:23.071
- Did you get to meet
some of the team?

1:09:23.202 --> 1:09:24.682
- Yeah. Yeah, they seem
like really great people.

1:09:24.812 --> 1:09:26.335
- They really are.

1:09:26.466 --> 1:09:27.684
Some of them have been
working at the company

1:09:27.815 --> 1:09:29.165
for over 20 years.

1:09:29.513 --> 1:09:32.515
I have to admit,

1:09:32.646 --> 1:09:35.953
there's a little apprehension
around us possibly partnering.

1:09:36.084 --> 1:09:38.304
- Yeah, I can understand that.

1:09:38.434 --> 1:09:40.045
Probably worried
about their jobs,

1:09:40.175 --> 1:09:42.003
but as long as you
continue to ensure them

1:09:42.134 --> 1:09:45.224
that it's a safe partnership,
I think they'll come around.

1:09:45.354 --> 1:09:47.226
- You're different
from what I expected.

1:09:47.357 --> 1:09:49.054
- Really? How so?

1:09:49.184 --> 1:09:50.751
- I don't know.

1:09:50.881 --> 1:09:52.970
I- I know that we
met on Zoom and, uh,

1:09:53.101 --> 1:09:57.367
but in person, I- I guess I
expected someone more corporate.

1:09:57.496 --> 1:09:59.107
- Oh, well, I hope
you're not disappointed.

1:09:59.237 --> 1:10:00.370
- No. No, the opposite.

1:10:05.070 --> 1:10:08.900
- Um, well, I would love to
meet the rest of the team.

1:10:09.030 --> 1:10:11.076
Maybe we should, uh,
head back to the party?

1:10:11.207 --> 1:10:13.077
- Yeah, um, I- I'll
be there in a minute.

1:10:13.209 --> 1:10:13.383
Okay.

1:10:53.553 --> 1:10:54.250
- Emily?

1:10:56.904 --> 1:10:59.124
- Emily?
- Hold on.

1:11:07.306 --> 1:11:11.441
- I- I'm really worried,
Em, who's doing all of this?

1:11:11.571 --> 1:11:13.312
- You're gonna think I'm
horrible for saying this,

1:11:13.443 --> 1:11:15.227
but

1:11:16.837 --> 1:11:20.362
Kyle just, he hasn't
been himself lately.

1:11:20.493 --> 1:11:22.669
I mean, he, he was the one

1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:25.455
who went to the storage
unit and he had the code.

1:11:26.673 --> 1:11:28.458
He had the hot tub fixed,

1:11:28.588 --> 1:11:31.764
and he was at the party
where I also found out

1:11:31.896 --> 1:11:35.291
that money was fraudulently
taken out of my accounts, again.

1:11:38.684 --> 1:11:40.644
You think I'm horrible
for saying that.

1:11:40.773 --> 1:11:45.475
- No. No, actually.

1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:49.392
Look, I- I didn't wanna
be the one to tell you,

1:11:49.522 --> 1:11:53.178
but I don't think I can keep
this from you any longer.

1:11:58.618 --> 1:11:58.662
- Hi, Ms. Caldwell.

1:12:03.362 --> 1:12:07.584
We've gone over everything
you've, uh, disclosed.

1:12:07.714 --> 1:12:09.673
We talked to Cassie
who is positive

1:12:09.803 --> 1:12:12.197
her slip down the stairs
was not an accident.

1:12:12.327 --> 1:12:14.242
We didn't find
anything on the stairs.

1:12:14.373 --> 1:12:17.463
That could mean that someone
cleaned up after her fall.

1:12:17.594 --> 1:12:20.074
But what we did find was that
someone broke the door lock,

1:12:20.205 --> 1:12:21.728
so the door could not be opened.

1:12:21.859 --> 1:12:24.209
That, coupled with your attacks,

1:12:26.385 --> 1:12:28.431
we're positive it all points
to premeditated murder.

1:12:28.561 --> 1:12:30.563
- Do you have any suspects?

1:12:30.693 --> 1:12:31.477
- Not yet.

1:12:33.392 --> 1:12:35.394
Does your husband live here?

1:12:35.525 --> 1:12:40.268
- No, we're, uh, we've
been living apart

1:12:40.398 --> 1:12:41.661
for a few months now.

1:12:41.791 --> 1:12:43.402
- Do you have a
good relationship?

1:12:43.532 --> 1:12:46.187
- We did. I don't, I
don't know anymore.

1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:50.540
Why are you asking
me about Kyle?

1:12:50.670 --> 1:12:52.237
- The only way into
your work building

1:12:52.368 --> 1:12:54.065
is through the use
of a key card, right?

1:12:54.195 --> 1:12:54.718
Yes.

1:12:56.241 --> 1:12:58.460
- The night that Cassie fell,

1:12:58.591 --> 1:13:02.160
Kyle's key card was the last
one to swipe in and out.

1:13:02.290 --> 1:13:03.683
We spoke to Kyle who
said his key card

1:13:03.814 --> 1:13:06.425
had been stolen
the previous week.

1:13:06.556 --> 1:13:09.254
- He never mentioned that, um,

1:13:09.385 --> 1:13:11.430
but if, if he put in a
request for a new one,

1:13:11.561 --> 1:13:13.171
there might be a record of that.

1:13:15.216 --> 1:13:16.740
Is Kyle a suspect?

1:13:16.870 --> 1:13:19.656
- It's protocol that
we look at everyone.

1:13:19.786 --> 1:13:21.440
- My assistant told me

1:13:21.571 --> 1:13:24.574
that Kyle visited a,
a divorce attorney.

1:13:24.704 --> 1:13:26.576
- What?

1:13:26.706 --> 1:13:29.796
- She saw him going into
a, a law office building.

1:13:29.927 --> 1:13:33.496
She Googled it and they only
handle divorces and estates.

1:13:33.626 --> 1:13:35.236
- Is he the sole beneficiary

1:13:35.367 --> 1:13:36.281
if something would
happen to you?

1:13:36.412 --> 1:13:37.717
- Yes, it would all go to him,

1:13:37.848 --> 1:13:39.632
and then eventually
our daughter.

1:13:39.763 --> 1:13:41.373
- All right.

1:13:41.504 --> 1:13:45.072
Well, if we have
any more questions,

1:13:45.202 --> 1:13:46.160
I'll keep in touch.

1:13:46.291 --> 1:13:47.814
I'll see my way out.

1:13:47.945 --> 1:13:48.598
- Thank you.

1:13:59.217 --> 1:14:00.130
Who are you calling?

1:14:00.261 --> 1:14:01.698
- The locksmith.

1:14:01.827 --> 1:14:03.308
We're changing the
locks immediately.

1:14:10.402 --> 1:14:10.837
Oh.

1:14:13.536 --> 1:14:14.666
It's okay.

1:14:14.798 --> 1:14:15.886
- It's not okay.

1:14:16.016 --> 1:14:18.844
How is any of this okay?

1:14:18.976 --> 1:14:22.936
- You're right. It's not okay.

1:14:23.067 --> 1:14:26.331
It's absolutely
completely scary.

1:14:26.462 --> 1:14:29.769
But I'm here and I'm
not going anywhere.

1:14:31.815 --> 1:14:33.817
- Do you think Kyle's
really doing all of this?

1:14:35.296 --> 1:14:37.037
- I don't know.

1:14:37.168 --> 1:14:39.300
- How can someone that
you think you know so well

1:14:41.477 --> 1:14:43.740
turn out to be
someone so different?

1:14:43.870 --> 1:14:46.307
I mean, was everything
that we had a lie?

1:14:46.438 --> 1:14:47.178
- No.

1:14:49.746 --> 1:14:52.183
I think sometimes
people are driven

1:14:52.313 --> 1:14:55.534
to do things that
surprise even themselves.

1:14:55.665 --> 1:14:58.318
It doesn't mean that the
good times weren't real,

1:14:58.450 --> 1:14:59.843
or that he never
meant any of it.

1:14:59.973 --> 1:15:04.674
It just, he's choosing
to do bad right now.

1:15:07.851 --> 1:15:09.592
It'll be fine.

1:15:09.722 --> 1:15:13.639
I promise it'll all be okay.

1:15:21.691 --> 1:15:23.214
- What book do you
wanna read tonight?

1:15:27.566 --> 1:15:28.698
How about Father Rabbit?

1:15:30.916 --> 1:15:32.353
Did you hear us talking?

1:15:35.226 --> 1:15:36.835
I'm sorry, sweetie.

1:15:36.967 --> 1:15:38.490
- Why are you and
Daddy fighting?

1:15:39.752 --> 1:15:41.014
- It's complicated, Nina.

1:15:41.145 --> 1:15:43.713
I wish I could
explain it to you,

1:15:43.843 --> 1:15:47.585
but just know that Daddy
and I love you so much

1:15:47.717 --> 1:15:49.632
and it has nothing
to do with you, okay?

1:15:51.938 --> 1:15:53.636
Do you wanna come sleep
in my bed tonight?

1:15:53.766 --> 1:15:55.028
- No. Can Lily read to me?

1:15:55.159 --> 1:15:57.509
- Well, I was thinking I could.

1:15:58.771 --> 1:16:00.338
- I want Lily to read to me.

1:16:02.862 --> 1:16:03.384
- Okay.

1:16:06.474 --> 1:16:07.650
Nina wants you to read to her.

1:16:08.955 --> 1:16:12.393
- Um, I- I'll be right in.

1:16:12.523 --> 1:16:15.266
The locksmith just left.
He changed all the doors.

1:16:15.396 --> 1:16:16.572
- Oh, thank you.

1:17:38.654 --> 1:17:42.353
- Emily, I just want to talk.

1:17:43.702 --> 1:17:46.487
Lily is lying to you.

1:17:46.618 --> 1:17:48.489
There are things
you do not know.

1:17:48.620 --> 1:17:50.273
- You need to leave.

1:17:51.971 --> 1:17:54.017
- I hired someone to
look into her past,

1:17:54.147 --> 1:17:56.715
a private investigator,
and I'm telling you,

1:17:56.846 --> 1:17:59.326
she is not telling
you the whole truth.

1:17:59.457 --> 1:18:01.023
- Kyle, you're
really scaring me.

1:18:01.154 --> 1:18:03.722
- The accident that
your mother got in,

1:18:03.853 --> 1:18:05.419
the one that left her
in the wheelchair?

1:18:05.550 --> 1:18:07.421
- I know about the accident.

1:18:07.552 --> 1:18:09.554
Lily told me our mother
blamed her for paralyzing her.

1:18:09.684 --> 1:18:12.731
- No, she's not telling
you the full story!

1:18:16.561 --> 1:18:18.868
- Em! I just want to talk.

1:18:23.611 --> 1:18:24.656
You have to let me in, please.

1:18:24.787 --> 1:18:25.612
- What's going on?
- Kyle's here.

1:18:25.744 --> 1:18:26.614
We have to call the police.

1:18:26.745 --> 1:18:27.702
To talk. Em, Em!

1:18:28.486 --> 1:18:30.793
Em, let me explain!

1:18:30.923 --> 1:18:32.359
- Here we go, baby girl, I
need you to get up, come on.

1:18:32.490 --> 1:18:33.969
Listen, I need you
to stay in here

1:18:34.100 --> 1:18:36.537
and don't come out, whatever
you hear, all right?

1:18:36.668 --> 1:18:38.191
Let me in!

1:18:38.322 --> 1:18:39.671
Did you
call the police?

1:18:39.802 --> 1:18:40.106
- I- I don't know
where my phone is.

1:18:40.237 --> 1:18:41.760
Please.

1:18:43.327 --> 1:18:45.329
Please, I just want to explain.

1:18:45.459 --> 1:18:46.764
Please, just let me in.

1:18:51.596 --> 1:18:53.554
- You stay with Nina.

1:19:02.737 --> 1:19:04.740
If you don't leave,
I'm calling the police.

1:19:04.870 --> 1:19:07.046
- I just wanna talk.

1:19:07.177 --> 1:19:09.440
If you don't wanna let me in,
just come to the window, okay?

1:19:11.007 --> 1:19:12.965
We were going
through a hard time.

1:19:13.096 --> 1:19:14.010
I dated somebody.

1:19:16.142 --> 1:19:17.273
- That's what you're banging
on my door to tell me?

1:19:17.404 --> 1:19:18.405
- It was Lily.

1:19:18.536 --> 1:19:20.494
- What?

1:19:20.625 --> 1:19:21.887
- At the time I didn't
know that you were sisters,

1:19:22.018 --> 1:19:24.411
but she obviously
knew who you were.

1:19:24.541 --> 1:19:25.848
I didn't wanna come clean

1:19:25.978 --> 1:19:27.545
because I didn't
wanna risk losing you.

1:19:27.675 --> 1:19:28.938
But now, with everything
that's happened,

1:19:29.068 --> 1:19:30.460
with the police
thinking I'm a suspect,

1:19:30.591 --> 1:19:31.679
I had to tell you.

1:19:31.809 --> 1:19:33.725
This has gone on far enough.

1:19:33.856 --> 1:19:35.466
She's the one behind
all the attacks.

1:19:35.596 --> 1:19:37.076
I'm sure of it.

1:19:37.207 --> 1:19:39.252
- She was with me
when Cassie fell.

1:19:39.383 --> 1:19:41.689
- Well, she must have gotten
somebody to do her dirty work.

1:19:41.820 --> 1:19:44.692
I saw her go into my office.

1:19:44.823 --> 1:19:46.737
When I confronted her, she
said Cassie just asked her

1:19:46.869 --> 1:19:48.044
to get something,
but shortly after

1:19:48.174 --> 1:19:50.481
my key card went missing.

1:19:51.656 --> 1:19:52.352
- This is ridiculous.

1:19:52.483 --> 1:19:55.529
- I hired a private investigator

1:19:55.660 --> 1:19:58.097
to dig into her background.

1:19:58.228 --> 1:20:00.143
He got access to her
sealed juvenile records.

1:20:00.273 --> 1:20:05.061
Em, you had a baby brother

1:20:05.191 --> 1:20:08.455
that she was accused of
killing, of smothering,

1:20:08.585 --> 1:20:10.544
and your parents, they
feared for their lives,

1:20:10.675 --> 1:20:12.068
so they sent her away.

1:20:12.198 --> 1:20:14.070
I know that all of
this sounds crazy,

1:20:14.200 --> 1:20:15.680
but you have to believe me.

1:20:17.202 --> 1:20:19.118
This sounds
more than crazy.

1:20:19.249 --> 1:20:21.642
I'm calling the police.
- Em, Em!

1:20:21.773 --> 1:20:23.340
Em! Em!

1:20:23.469 --> 1:20:27.083
I can't let you do that.

1:20:27.213 --> 1:20:28.693
- Lily, what are you doing?

1:20:32.871 --> 1:20:33.871
Oh-uh. Oh, I don't-

1:20:34.003 --> 1:20:35.918
- Lily, wait!

1:20:36.048 --> 1:20:37.963
- I wondered when you were
finally gonna come clean.

1:20:38.094 --> 1:20:40.183
Oh, it must have been agonizing

1:20:40.313 --> 1:20:41.967
when you didn't know
whether, if or when

1:20:42.098 --> 1:20:44.056
I was gonna tell her the truth.

1:20:44.187 --> 1:20:46.929
But you left out the part
where you wanted to be with me.

1:20:47.059 --> 1:20:48.974
How your wife didn't
understand you.

1:20:49.105 --> 1:20:50.976
How we were gonna
run away together.

1:20:51.107 --> 1:20:52.934
- You used me to get to Emily.

1:20:53.065 --> 1:20:54.153
- Don't for one second think

1:20:54.284 --> 1:20:55.285
that you're the victim in this!

1:20:55.415 --> 1:20:58.679
You're right. He is a liar.

1:21:01.943 --> 1:21:02.945
But he does love you.

1:21:03.075 --> 1:21:04.163
He's never gonna leave you.

1:21:07.166 --> 1:21:08.124
Yeah, that doesn't
matter. I don't care.

1:21:08.254 --> 1:21:10.126
I don't care about that.

1:21:10.255 --> 1:21:12.911
What I care about is
everything else you've got.

1:21:13.041 --> 1:21:15.174
All of this!

1:21:15.305 --> 1:21:18.786
How come you got all of
this when I got nothing?

1:21:18.916 --> 1:21:21.964
There were nights I had
to beg people for food.

1:21:22.094 --> 1:21:23.094
- I wanted to help you.

1:21:23.226 --> 1:21:24.791
- Oh, really?

1:21:24.923 --> 1:21:26.925
You were gonna,

1:21:27.056 --> 1:21:29.145
you were gonna sign
away half the house,

1:21:29.275 --> 1:21:31.974
half the business, 'cause
that's what I'm entitled to.

1:21:32.103 --> 1:21:33.976
- I'll sign, I'll sign
whatever paperwork you want

1:21:34.106 --> 1:21:37.153
right now.
- No, I don't want paperwork!

1:21:37.282 --> 1:21:39.285
I want this, all of this,

1:21:39.416 --> 1:21:42.809
and I don't want you to exist.

1:21:42.941 --> 1:21:45.248
You're nothing but a replacement
for our little brother.

1:21:45.378 --> 1:21:47.032
You should have never
been born either.

1:21:48.032 --> 1:21:48.904
Emily, run!

1:21:49.034 --> 1:21:50.166
- Mommy!

1:21:59.088 --> 1:22:01.003
- Just go! Go!

1:22:09.315 --> 1:22:10.360
Open the
door, Mommy, hurry!

1:22:10.490 --> 1:22:12.797
Please, no!

1:22:15.278 --> 1:22:16.540
- Don't move.

1:22:17.758 --> 1:22:18.672
Give me Nina.

1:22:18.803 --> 1:22:20.239
- Lily, please don't.

1:22:20.370 --> 1:22:21.632
- Give her to me.
Give her to me!

1:22:21.762 --> 1:22:22.807
Give me Nina!

1:22:26.767 --> 1:22:29.987
Mommy!

1:22:35.124 --> 1:22:35.951
- Mom!
- Baby!

1:22:53.925 --> 1:22:56.710
- Hopefully this is the
last time our paths cross.

1:22:56.841 --> 1:22:58.712
We found this in her bedroom.

1:22:58.843 --> 1:23:00.105
Either of you missing any money?

1:23:01.889 --> 1:23:03.152
We'll return the money to you

1:23:03.282 --> 1:23:04.718
once it's been
processed for evidence.

1:23:04.849 --> 1:23:06.329
We searched her phone

1:23:06.459 --> 1:23:07.678
and we're gonna apprehend
her co-defendant.

1:23:24.869 --> 1:23:27.002
- I'm gonna go check on Nina.

1:23:51.939 --> 1:23:56.857
- She's here, she's here!

1:24:02.210 --> 1:24:04.169
Surprise!

1:24:06.389 --> 1:24:07.737
- Thank you.

1:24:07.868 --> 1:24:08.956
- Happy birthday.

1:24:09.087 --> 1:24:09.957
Thank you, honey.

1:24:10.088 --> 1:24:11.523
That's so sweet.
- Hi.

1:24:11.655 --> 1:24:14.005
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday.

1:24:15.398 --> 1:24:17.313
Happy birthday, Em.

1:24:17.443 --> 1:24:18.749
- It's great.
- You're very welcome.

1:24:18.879 --> 1:24:19.837
- Thank You.

1:24:22.448 --> 1:24:23.797
Hi.
- Happy birthday.

1:24:23.928 --> 1:24:25.755
- Thank you, Cassie.
- Oh.

1:24:28.237 --> 1:24:29.889
So Kyle showed up.

1:24:30.021 --> 1:24:31.240
- Yeah.

1:24:31.370 --> 1:24:33.764
I'm surprised
that he's not groveling

1:24:33.894 --> 1:24:35.460
to get you back.

1:24:35.592 --> 1:24:36.723
- There's no going back, Cassie,

1:24:36.853 --> 1:24:41.467
but we've reached a good
place and it feels right.

1:24:41.598 --> 1:24:44.992
- Mm, so that means you're
ready to start dating again?

1:24:45.123 --> 1:24:48.387
- Well, the ink on my
divorce isn't dry yet, but.

1:24:48.518 --> 1:24:51.216
- Well, there is someone who
I think would be good for you.

1:24:54.089 --> 1:24:54.959
- You invited him?

1:24:56.874 --> 1:24:57.788
I'm gonna go say hi.

1:25:01.443 --> 1:25:02.749
Hi.
- Hi.

1:25:03.968 --> 1:25:04.969
- I'm glad that you came.

1:25:06.753 --> 1:25:07.972
- Happy birthday.

1:25:08.103 --> 1:25:09.452
- Thank you.

1:25:09.582 --> 1:25:10.975
I promise that this
party will not end

1:25:11.106 --> 1:25:12.977
with me being tossed off a dock.

1:25:16.546 --> 1:25:17.286
Thank you.

1:25:19.592 --> 1:25:21.377
- Just a gesture to
mark the beginning

1:25:21.507 --> 1:25:25.294
of Caldwell PR and Viator's
official partnership.

1:25:32.996 --> 1:25:34.999
Now we're alive.
