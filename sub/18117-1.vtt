<i> Is this our new house?</i>

00:21.422 --> 00:25.324
<i> No, this isn't our new house,</i>
  <i> bud, this belongs to one</i>
  <i> of Mommy's yoga clients.</i>

00:25.326 --> 00:27.259
<i> Yeah, we couldn't</i>
    <i> afford this house,</i>

00:27.261 --> 00:29.361
<i> -but we're happy</i>
  <i> to stay here.</i>
  -<i> Tim... Tim...</i>

00:29.363 --> 00:30.829
<i> This is like a nice</i>
     <i> hotel house.</i>

00:30.831 --> 00:34.199
- <i> Are you gonna be</i>  <i> a D-O-U-C-H-E?
- </i>  -<i> No, no, no.</i>

00:34.201 --> 00:35.868
<i> Okay, good.</i>

00:35.870 --> 00:39.004
     <i> It's gonna be a really</i>
     <i> super fun vacation</i>
     <i> for our family.</i>

00:39.006 --> 00:40.873
- <i> Oh!</i>
-    -<i> Yeah!</i>

00:40.875 --> 00:42.274
- <i> Are you excited?</i>
-  -<i> Yeah.</i>

00:42.276 --> 00:44.576
All right, Jude,
     it's time.

00:45.745 --> 00:47.346
             He's going first,
             for sure.

00:50.016 --> 00:51.417
Okay, thank you.

00:53.853 --> 00:55.587
- All right.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.057
Guys, swimming pool.

01:02.529 --> 01:04.462
       -Good, right?
       -Yeah, it's great.

01:06.466 --> 01:09.034
       -I'm really glad
       we're doing this.
       -Me too.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.702
             -Yeah?
             -Yeah.

01:10.704 --> 01:13.806
      -It's gonna be fun.
      -We'll build a fire.

01:13.808 --> 01:15.140
   What do you think, buddy?

01:15.142 --> 01:16.475
Good.

01:20.113 --> 01:21.480
            -Fun.
            -Yeah.

01:25.252 --> 01:28.320
...for me now, okay? Perfect.

01:28.322 --> 01:32.491
  Oh, yeah.
  That's called Child's Pose.
  You can put your head
  down right there.

01:33.326 --> 01:36.662
  That's a resting pose. Yeah.

01:36.664 --> 01:40.499
  It's like a really, really
  sweet resting pose.

01:42.535 --> 01:45.771
     Okay, and then you're gonna
     come up on your hands.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.907
      Up. Stay there.
      Now we're gonna pretend...

01:48.909 --> 01:52.544
    We're gonna come up
    a little bit,
    come up where you just were.

01:52.546 --> 01:56.448
           Right here.
           Okay, now we're gonna
           pretend we're a cow.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.217
   -We're gonna go like this.
   -Okay.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.985
       -We go like this.
       -A cow.

01:59.987 --> 02:02.154
         A cow. And we're gonna
         kind of arch our...

02:02.156 --> 02:03.856
             Yeah, that's
             perfect, buddy.

02:03.858 --> 02:06.658
And then we're gonna pretend
 we're a cat and go like this.

02:23.077 --> 02:25.144
         Left leg,
         which is your left leg?

02:25.778 --> 02:27.479
       This one.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.349
      This one?
      This one's your right leg.
      This one's your left leg.

02:30.351 --> 02:33.152
         Okay, you're gonna fold
         this one in right here,

02:33.154 --> 02:36.822
         and now you're gonna
         bend over your left leg
         and touch your toes
         with your fingers.

02:37.557 --> 02:39.024
            Can you do that one?

02:47.334 --> 02:49.601
<i> You're gonna straighten</i>
        <i> your legs,</i>

02:49.603 --> 02:53.338
    and you're gonna touch
    your toes like this.
    Can you do it like that?

02:53.340 --> 02:55.340
           Yeah.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.876
- Wow, you sure can,
  and then you're gonna fold
  your head right over there.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.611
        God bless you,
        God bless you.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.781
Gesundheit.

03:02.783 --> 03:05.617
  We're gonna go like this,
  and you're gonna put
  your head down for a second,
  like, down here.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.153
- <i> How does that feel?</i>
-  -<i> Good.</i>

03:08.155 --> 03:10.989
<i> It feels good?
</i>  <i> Do you feel like</i>  <i> a nice stretch in here?</i>

03:32.279 --> 03:34.246
Here,
     you want some of this?

03:42.121 --> 03:46.191
Hey, Lee,
look what I found
on the hill.

03:46.193 --> 03:49.761
      So I was just
      digging around here,
      I wanted to see
      where that sprinkler went,

03:49.763 --> 03:51.363
               and I started
               kicking around
               and I found this.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.798
        -Can I touch it?
        -Yes.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.800
    And then this bone, Lee,
    was, like, back in the hill.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.502
      That's a bone?
      Let me see that.
      I wanna touch that.

03:57.504 --> 03:58.704
           I feel like we gotta
           know whatever--

03:58.706 --> 04:01.173
    I mean, are you trying
    to think like "pow pow"?

04:01.175 --> 04:02.808
- Mom?
-           -Yes.

04:02.810 --> 04:07.946
    I think at some point,
    somebody put this...
    And if we go deep in here...

04:07.948 --> 04:09.514
      Oh, God. No, no, no.

04:09.516 --> 04:12.451
       And I feel like we should
       probably find out
       what it is.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.552
              Why?

04:17.890 --> 04:23.061
  See, now you know
  what happens to my brain,
  because now my brain thinks
  there's like 20 bodies...

04:23.063 --> 04:25.097
                 There could be.

04:25.099 --> 04:28.033
- There absolutely      could be.
-       -It's my skin.

04:28.835 --> 04:31.436
All right. Okay.

04:32.839 --> 04:36.675
Great. So if I find it myself
then I'll call, for sure.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.811
It's ridiculous.
Absolutely.

04:39.813 --> 04:43.382
Okay, thank you.
Yeah, goodbye. Thank you.

04:45.585 --> 04:47.286
That was a joke.

04:47.288 --> 04:52.190
Uh, the L.A.P.D. just said
that it's not their job to
dig out somebody else's trash,

04:52.192 --> 04:54.626
and to call
if we find the body,

04:54.628 --> 04:56.495
but in the meantime,
there's nothing
they could do.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.830
And she had a tone with me,
like I was doing
something wrong.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.833
                    Good.

05:01.835 --> 05:05.037
And I told her
about the gun
and I told her
about the bone, so...

05:05.039 --> 05:06.571
               So, what are you
               gonna do?

05:06.573 --> 05:08.407
I'm gonna dig out
the body.

05:08.409 --> 05:11.176
    -Or I'm gonna at least
    get closer to that.
    -No, I think
    we're gonna leave it.

05:11.178 --> 05:13.011
Lee, we can't leave it.

05:13.013 --> 05:16.214
             Tim, I was just
             putting down Jude
             and he was like,
             "Where's the bone?"

05:16.216 --> 05:17.883
Fine, we don't tell Jude.
I'm fine with that.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.485
I told Jude,
and he said, "What was it?"
And I said it was just pretend.

05:20.487 --> 05:23.188
    -It was probably a bone
    from a coyote.
    -So let's find out
    if it's pretend.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.456
                     Why?

05:24.458 --> 05:26.458
'Cause there might be
a dead body on our hill.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.093
             It's not our hill.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.395
Fine, of the hill
of this person.

05:30.397 --> 05:34.199
       Of my client,
       of my livelihood, my job,

05:34.201 --> 05:37.002
 And I can't have them come home
 after shooting a movie
 in Budapest and say,

05:37.004 --> 05:38.870
       "Oh, guess what.
       And by the way,
       while you're out of town,

05:38.872 --> 05:42.140
   "my husband decided to, like,
   excavate your hillside,

05:42.142 --> 05:45.777
"and we found remains of a body,
and we think it's conn..."

05:45.779 --> 05:48.547
           I mean, what?
           Connected to what?
           Where is it gonna go?

05:48.549 --> 05:51.516
Well, obviously, I don't know
the end of the mystery
at the beginning of the mystery.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.585
    Right, if there's a mystery.

05:53.587 --> 05:58.357
   I mean, my guess is that
   it's an animal bone
   and it just happened to be...

05:58.359 --> 06:01.059
  -Some other animal shot it?
  -Yeah.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.729
    -Come on, Lee. Come on.
    -You come on.

06:03.731 --> 06:06.631
    Let's not make this
    a crazy drama.
    Let's just enjoy this place.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.300
Okay.

06:08.302 --> 06:10.302
        -That was just
        way too easy.
        -I was thinking.

06:10.304 --> 06:12.003
           No, you said, "Okay."

06:12.005 --> 06:14.639
     And then I did
     see you think like, "Okay,
     I'm gonna appease my wife

06:14.641 --> 06:17.609
     -"and then I'm gonna
     keep digging."
     -No. I won't dig.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.478
       -No more digging?
       -No more digging.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.615
Let's go enjoy this place.

06:27.121 --> 06:29.721
And if you want
a little bit more of a stretch,

06:29.723 --> 06:32.491
you could push
your foot up to the ceiling.

06:34.794 --> 06:35.861
Nice.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.700
Tell me
if this is too much.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.336
Ready? Ooh-hoo!

06:44.338 --> 06:46.104
All right, good.
We made up a new game.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.172
            -Oh!
            -Great!

06:48.608 --> 06:51.042
     You're gonna arch
     your back and look up.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.046
        Then we're gonna
        round our backs

06:55.048 --> 06:58.150
 and kind of, like, tighten
 right in here, right in here.

06:58.152 --> 07:03.088
No, don't get me!
Don't get me, buddy!
Don't get me!

07:03.923 --> 07:07.325
What? Aah! Full wipe-out!

07:07.327 --> 07:09.661
<i> It's cheesy to say,</i>
       <i> but really,</i>

07:09.663 --> 07:14.065
 and people say this
 all the time,
 but they really were, like,
 glowing when they came back,

07:14.067 --> 07:15.734
      -and they seemed...
      -Yeah.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.804
   Maybe this is just
   how I feel about Ken,
   but he seemed a lot nicer.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.172
             -Yeah.
             -Okay.

07:20.174 --> 07:22.607
You know, like, they really...
It's something that it's like...

07:22.609 --> 07:26.044
- I think you owe it to yourself to do it, you know?
-  -Mmm.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.546
        Yeah, I mean, honestly--

07:27.548 --> 07:30.048
I mean,
I've always wanted
to go to India, like...

07:30.050 --> 07:32.384
   -literally forever.
   -So do it, fucking do it.

07:32.386 --> 07:35.287
You know,
once you have kids,
it's like you can't,
I just can't...

07:35.289 --> 07:38.824
            That kid came
            into your life,
            it wasn't the other
            way around.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.393
        He came in to your home.
        Take your kid
        with you, you know?

07:41.395 --> 07:43.195
       Don't let that limit you,
       you know?

07:43.197 --> 07:44.329
              Ugh, yeah.

07:44.331 --> 07:46.097
      -No, it's not--
      -When we have kids,

07:46.099 --> 07:48.366
        we're not, you know,
        it's not gonna limit us.

07:48.368 --> 07:50.502
- No.
-          -Mm-hmm.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.404
What time was it
when you looked at your phone?

07:52.406 --> 07:55.407
              It was uh... 5:30.

07:55.409 --> 07:57.809
I have to get home
and make the sweet pea dinner.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.077
             -Oh.
             -Yeah.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.712
Have a fantastic time.

08:00.714 --> 08:03.615
             -Thank you so much
             for this beautiful
             session today.
             -You guys practice.

08:30.309 --> 08:32.711
You don't have
regular milk, do you?

08:32.712 --> 08:35.046
           Um, we have raw milk.

08:36.816 --> 08:38.783
Do you have
regular milk, though?

08:38.784 --> 08:45.924
Um, today we have goat's milk,
uh, coconut milk, almond milk,
cashew milk, um, soy milk,

08:45.926 --> 08:49.594
       and then there's hemp
       and flax milk actually
       in the dry goods section.

08:49.596 --> 08:51.630
So no
just regular milk?

08:51.931 --> 08:53.131
                      Not today.

08:53.133 --> 08:58.637
  I can't believe the poopies
  go in the ground.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.872
  -That's where dogs and cats
  go poopie, in the ground.
  -Jude, Jude, Jude...

09:00.874 --> 09:04.876
      Let's have dinner.
      It's not nice to talk
      about poopies
      at the dinner table, okay?

09:04.878 --> 09:06.211
             -Okay.
             -Okay.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.979
        -But guess what.
        -But I love you.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.515
  -And your daddy needs to do
  the taxes this weekend...
  -Yeah.

09:10.517 --> 09:14.753
   ...because I'm gonna have
   a nervous breakdown
   if I eat dinner on this table
   like this one more time.

09:14.755 --> 09:17.622
You got it. Hey, Jude,
can I ask you a question
about the taxes?

09:17.624 --> 09:19.558
Uh, did you take
a poopie today?

09:20.026 --> 09:21.860
           I didn't.

09:21.862 --> 09:22.894
   What?

09:22.896 --> 09:25.530
     -Tim, I'm not joking.
     -Okay, yeah.

09:25.532 --> 09:28.667
         We love you so much.
         You're such a good boy.

09:29.669 --> 09:32.037
          -Aw.
          -All right.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.239
- See? You make me
       the bad guy.
       -How do I...

09:34.241 --> 09:35.907
               Because you have
               to do this.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.109
    -And them I'm getting...
    I'm turning into this.
    -Okay, how about this?

09:38.111 --> 09:41.680
You can go play.
You can do whatever
you want, buddy boy.
Is that okay?

09:41.682 --> 09:44.716
 -I'll do the taxes. I'm sorry.
 -No, but see?
 You see what happens?

09:44.718 --> 09:47.619
       And then I'm...
       And then I'm the bad guy.

09:47.621 --> 09:50.689
       Come here.
       Come here.

09:50.691 --> 09:53.058
      -Just do it.
      This weekend. I know.
      -Okay.

09:56.228 --> 09:58.196
<i> I don't wanna take</i>

09:58.198 --> 10:01.166
your mom and
your step-dad's money
in this moment.

10:01.168 --> 10:05.403
And I don't think
there's anything wrong with that
'cause we're talking about
a three-year-old boy.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.738
               Mm-hmm.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.274
If this conversation
was about college
and it was...

10:09.276 --> 10:11.509
 -college or no college, then--
 -They say, they say...

10:11.511 --> 10:17.215
        They say, they say that
        preschool now
        is more important in
        getting into college

10:17.217 --> 10:18.950
   -than, like, high school.
   -Stop it. I don't--

10:18.952 --> 10:21.152
   -It is!
   They say development is--
   -Who the fuck is "they"?

10:21.154 --> 10:25.423
      The experts, whatever.
      All the stuff that I read.

10:25.425 --> 10:31.930
Yeah, and then
we read another thing
about preschools where, uh,
the one that was all dirt

10:31.932 --> 10:33.865
and they play in the dirt
all the time

10:33.867 --> 10:36.201
  -and they raise
  those turtles.
  -Yeah, I read that article.

10:36.203 --> 10:41.506
And you spend $12,000
for three months
and you need to pay
for every extra activity.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.008
And there's...

10:43.010 --> 10:45.510
    Yeah, but, here's the thing,
    you wouldn't be
    paying for it.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.879
         That's the thing.
         That's the thing
         that I'm talking about.

10:47.881 --> 10:50.882
How about our son
goes to school
in the neighborhood
he lives in?

10:50.884 --> 10:54.019
     Yeah, how about
     that school is a six?

10:54.887 --> 10:57.689
              How about
              he's in preschool?

10:57.691 --> 10:59.824
It's not a good preschool.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.794
Let them run around
and figure out problems
on their own.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.663
And so if one kid
bites another kid,

11:04.665 --> 11:07.999
   -well then, the biter
   hangs out with the bitee...
   -Oh, stop. Stop.

11:08.001 --> 11:12.604
...and they have to figure out
what they did wrong,
and they talk it out
for $10,000 over three months.

11:12.606 --> 11:16.174
           You're making me mad.
           I'm reading this.
           You're making me mad.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.310
      -Do you want some of this?
      -No.

11:19.312 --> 11:22.180
      -"Love and Foreplay
      Aren't Blind."
      -Yeah, right.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.748
My favorite chapter.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.351
   What does that even mean?

11:46.940 --> 11:50.275
    Hi, Mom, it's me.
    Can you give me a call
    when you get this?

11:50.277 --> 11:55.246
       I, uh, was thinking
       about coming down
       for the weekend
       with Jude.

11:55.248 --> 12:00.452
    And maybe asking
    if you'd babysit for me
    so I can have
    a night out to myself.

12:00.454 --> 12:04.589
  I just...
  Tim's got a lot to of stuff
  to do this weekend

12:04.591 --> 12:07.459
    and I just need a break
    to be honest with you.

12:07.461 --> 12:09.461
       I love you.
       Call me back. Bye.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.614
You're on the hook
for next time.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.816
                 Okay. Have fun.

12:31.818 --> 12:34.085
   -Don't have too much fun.
   -I won't.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.720
                   Okay, say hi
                   to everybody.

12:35.722 --> 12:36.988
      Yes, I will.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.957
       -Love you guys.
       -We love you, Daddy.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.992
- Bye.
-           -Bye.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.995
Okay, bud,
     you're ready to go see
     Grandma and Pop-pop?

12:43.997 --> 12:45.096
Yeah.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.865
Don't forget the taxes.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.500
Don't forget the taxes.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.802
                 I won't.

12:50.804 --> 12:53.772
    Why don't I come to you?
    Because I haven't seen
    the kids in so long.

12:53.774 --> 12:58.176
     That would be so nice,
     and then we'll just
     do it from there.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.811
             Cool?

12:59.813 --> 13:03.848
  All right, get ready, baby.
  We are gonna have a fun
  Saturday night.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.590
- Mama?
-          -Yeah?

13:12.592 --> 13:14.659
Why isn't Daddy here?

13:14.661 --> 13:20.165
Because Daddy had to
  stay home and do some things
  that Mommy wanted him to do.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.768
Because Daddy
has some responsibilities.

13:23.770 --> 13:27.672
     Oh, what is
     a responsibility?

13:27.674 --> 13:30.441
   -What's a responsibility?
   -Yeah.

13:30.443 --> 13:35.780
 Sometimes mommies want daddies
 to pitch in and help out
 and do things,

13:35.782 --> 13:37.448
      and those are called
      responsibilities.

13:37.450 --> 13:41.719
   And if you don't do them,
   then Mommy comes after you

13:41.721 --> 13:47.125
  and goes, "Rawr!
  Why didn't you do everything
  I wanted you to do?"

13:47.127 --> 13:49.260
   -You don't like
   when Mommy gets like that.
   -No.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.229
      No. I don't like it
      either, actually.

13:51.231 --> 13:54.365
      So Daddy is at home
      doing his homework.

13:55.201 --> 13:56.968
          -Right?
          -Yeah.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.145
             Yeah!

14:48.387 --> 14:50.722
- Hey, man.
-         -Hey, man.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.056
- How are you?
-           -Good.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.491
Can you believe it?

14:54.627 --> 14:56.227
     This is very strange.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.163
 Very unusual for people like me
 to be at a place like this.

14:59.165 --> 15:01.432
  -It's the best, right?
  -Yeah. Thanks for having me.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.067
Yeah, you got it.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.236
I'm just griling out, man.
Check it out.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.572
Explore the place.
This is all ours tonight.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.540
There's a pool,
there's a hill.

15:09.542 --> 15:10.909
                Yeah?

15:12.411 --> 15:15.246
I think I am gonna walk around.
This whole place is hers?

15:15.248 --> 15:16.915
                     Everything.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.316
Hey, would you grab
some buns?

15:19.184 --> 15:21.619
                     Yeah, yeah.

15:21.621 --> 15:25.590
       I'm gonna pee
       in each of the bathrooms,
       is that okay?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.793
<i> So then the lesson is,</i>
  <i> "Hopefully you get</i>
  <i> a really lucky,</i>

15:28.795 --> 15:32.063
and your grandmother
marries a man
who's got a lot of money,

15:32.065 --> 15:34.198
and then therefore
you get to go
to private school,

15:34.200 --> 15:36.234
but your parents
couldn't have
sent you there."

15:36.236 --> 15:37.669
                   Yeah.

15:37.671 --> 15:40.805
And so then you're
essentially alienated
from your own surroundings.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.974
                   Right.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.810
               Yeah, I mean,
               there's pros
               and cons to both.

15:45.812 --> 15:49.681
   I think the optimistic choice
   is sending them
   to public school

15:49.683 --> 15:50.949
               because we teach
               at public school.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.650
     That's right.
     That's right.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.452
     If we don't believe
     that you can send
     your kids to public school.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.587
 -Then what am I doing?
 -That's right. What are we...

15:56.589 --> 15:57.855
        Yeah, what are we doing?

15:57.857 --> 15:59.791
       Yeah, what is
       that lesson then?

15:59.793 --> 16:02.460
     I teach there,
     but my kid doesn't go.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.095
         -Very cynical.
         -Yes.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.997
               I'm very cynical.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.399
     Mind you, I teach gym.

16:08.401 --> 16:12.337
We would start
constructing the fire
when there was still light.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.072
      -That's right.
      -So we, you know,

16:14.074 --> 16:16.174
we could do it right,
the tepee.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.709
           No, I'm good, thanks.

16:17.711 --> 16:19.243
       Here you go, Paul.

16:19.245 --> 16:21.012
              When we told her,
              you know...

16:21.014 --> 16:23.047
  So we were
  with the cat and it's like,
  "We don't believe in anything.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.882
    We don't believe
    you're going to cat heaven."

16:24.884 --> 16:28.686
        So it's like
        we're just telling her,
        like, "We appreciate
        that you were alive.

16:28.688 --> 16:32.190
- Oh, jeez.
  -Like it's just so...
  It's devastating.

16:32.192 --> 16:35.760
You know what, though,
having someone come over
and put the cat
out of its misery,

16:35.762 --> 16:38.696
way better
than taking an animal in.

16:38.698 --> 16:42.266
'Cause the last thing
they'll remember is all this
panic and fear in the car.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.002
- You shouldn't      take them in.
      -No.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.738
I think you have
        to put them down
        at the house.

16:46.740 --> 16:49.741
       I think it's funny
       'cause it's just like...

16:49.743 --> 16:55.346
         Cremation versus burial
         is such a no-brainer
         when I think about it.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.882
  It's like crem...
  Everyone should be cremated.

16:57.884 --> 16:59.450
Why is it
a no-brainer?

16:59.452 --> 17:01.219
        Because there's too many
        people on the earth,
        there's no space.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.588
    -Oh, you mean practically?
    -Yeah.

17:05.523 --> 17:08.526
So no one got it.
       All right.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.194
           150!

17:14.165 --> 17:15.800
      That was
      a nice toss, though.

17:15.801 --> 17:17.602
Oh, yeah, thanks.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.037
- Okay.
-         -Perfect.

17:20.372 --> 17:23.473
       350 to 280 to 120.
       One hundred!

17:54.840 --> 17:56.707
<i>420 to 180 to 130.</i>

18:09.354 --> 18:10.655
                      Hey, uh...

18:11.457 --> 18:13.524
                    Sorry, um...

18:13.526 --> 18:17.195
     Did I get the wrong house?
     I'm looking for a Tim guy.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.197
Oh, yeah,
     Tim's in the kitchen.

18:19.798 --> 18:20.865
                       Hey, man!

18:20.867 --> 18:22.066
  Whoa!

18:22.068 --> 18:23.835
       Look at this guy!

18:23.837 --> 18:26.070
       -What's up, homie?
       -Yes, man!

18:26.072 --> 18:27.271
       -You made it.
       -Look at this guy.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.207
           Look at this
           beautiful face.

18:29.209 --> 18:32.310
      And the fucking bod!

18:32.312 --> 18:35.113
- Hey, man.
-        -I'm so glad       you came, man.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.248
 -Good, I'm so glad to be here,
 -I miss you.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.617
   What are you guys doing,
   dick-sucking-cock fest
   over here?

18:39.619 --> 18:41.752
  -What's happening?
  -No. Hey, let's get a beer.

18:41.754 --> 18:45.189
- What's going on?
-        -You fucking       made it, man!

18:45.191 --> 18:50.194
   The Weight Watchers points
   just on the hamburger bun
   is like 12-13 points.

18:50.696 --> 18:51.863
         No hamburger.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.834
                 Ray, you want
                 one of these?

18:56.836 --> 18:58.536
So they were literally
 I'd say about three feet apart
 from each other.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.104
Any more people
     coming to the...

19:00.106 --> 19:03.241
I found this,
which I don't know
what that is.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.276
  And then I found that, man.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.578
What the fuck?

19:07.580 --> 19:08.679
         Grab it. Yeah.

19:09.648 --> 19:10.715
     Wow.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.117
   -That was in the...
   -That was in the... Yeah.

19:13.119 --> 19:16.420
I mean, that was probably
a foot and a half in the ground
and that's on the hill,
but check it out.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.422
I mean,
the land is crazy.

19:18.424 --> 19:21.926
  -That's beautiful,
  look at that.
  -That's pretty awesome, man.

19:21.928 --> 19:25.930
   Tim, you want a peanut butter
   and boysenberry sandwich?

19:25.932 --> 19:29.267
Well, what do we...
Let's go down there
and let's dig this shit up.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.235
     I did. Well, I got
     this out there,

19:31.237 --> 19:32.937
Well, let's keep digging.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.572
  -Why don't we keep digging?
  -Yeah.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.074
        I think we're gonna
        just sort of hang here.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.676
            -I'm in.
            -Yeah.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.411
Let's do this.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.880
- Let's hold it down.
  You guys, let's hang here...
  -Come on. Let's go.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.283
      Okay,
      that's you.

19:45.717 --> 19:47.251
All right.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.903
              Come on,
              it's gonna be fun.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.271
                          Yeah?

20:11.810 --> 20:13.177
This is great.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.880
What are you doing?
    Watch your steps    right here, guys.

20:19.484 --> 20:20.985
     That's it, down there.

20:22.621 --> 20:25.590
    So this is where
    I found the bone, guys.

20:25.592 --> 20:29.260
   And then right here
   I dug a little bit deeper,
   if you see that hole,

20:29.262 --> 20:31.028
   this is where the gun was.

20:31.030 --> 20:34.365
   So, Adam, you wanna
   jump up there?
   You mind taking the lead?

20:34.367 --> 20:36.133
 Paul, you wanna get in there?
 Yeah, awesome.

20:36.135 --> 20:37.468
          Actually,
          leave that light.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.503
     Yeah, and then if we
     just get in here...

20:39.505 --> 20:41.906
   -Ray, you wanna...
   You and me can work this.
   -Yeah.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.942
Uh, and Phil, just,
you know, I mean,
like, whatever you want, buddy.

20:55.321 --> 20:58.723
You can't just dig up   someone's yard.
   I think it's illegal.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.562
           Holy shit!

21:04.564 --> 21:11.068
    Dudes, a license plate.
    Nevada. 5752673.

21:11.070 --> 21:13.304
       -Wow.
       -That's like, wow!

21:14.506 --> 21:16.707
  It's just gar...
  There's garbage in the ground.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.110
         If you dig far enough
         you'll find a landfill.

21:19.112 --> 21:22.413
Stop, Phil.
       Stop, man.
       This is really
       fucking exciting.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.081
  -That's a great find, dude.
  -Thanks, man.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.616
I think this is
a good area.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.985
    -So that was right here?
    -Yeah, let's stick
    around here then.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.820
 Look, if you don't wanna dig,

21:30.522 --> 21:32.590
         how about
         some hookers?

21:32.592 --> 21:36.694
   No, no, I, uh...
   That's sort of an
   illogical jump you just made.

21:36.696 --> 21:40.231
         You went from digging
         in the yard to hookers?

21:40.233 --> 21:43.968
             That seems
             sort of irrational.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.803
              I was having
              a great time.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.171
      You wanna play 500?

21:47.173 --> 21:48.873
        Yeah, we could play 500.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.409
  Guys, stop fighting, stop it.
  Let's just enjoy--

21:51.411 --> 21:54.512
   I'm not fighting.
   I'm actually being inquisi...
   I'm really asking
   a real question.

21:54.514 --> 21:57.815
   Let's just enjoy the moment.
   There could be a dead body
   right beneath us.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.685
    You know, it's pretty
    fucking exciting, Phil.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.487
   -It could be any--
   -Well, I mean, you know,

22:03.489 --> 22:04.922
if Phil doesn't
wanna dig, that's cool.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.792
I'm not gonna judge him
He doesn't have to dig.

22:07.794 --> 22:10.761
But I'm just saying,
is there an alternative

22:12.831 --> 22:15.132
to digging?
Do you have
another alternative?

22:15.134 --> 22:17.468
Because I'm game.
I'm open to ideas.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.270
   -Go to a bar or something?
   -What the fuck is that?

22:19.272 --> 22:20.471
It was right there.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.406
      -You just found it?
      -Yeah.

22:22.408 --> 22:25.142
   Hold on, let me see that.
   Are you kidding me, dude?

22:25.144 --> 22:26.577
It was right there.

22:31.249 --> 22:33.250
              This is too weird
              for me, man.

22:33.252 --> 22:36.153
     Wow, this is for real.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.455
        Admit it, Phil.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.557
              It's strange.
              That's strange.

22:39.559 --> 22:43.060
        Let me see that.
        Look at that.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.296
       -All right.
       -That's some real
       <i> Quest for Fire...</i>

22:45.298 --> 22:48.466
  -We gotta go deep.
  We gotta go all the way out.
  <i> -...2001</i> shit, right there.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.935
             ...for a cadaver,
             they're worth
             a lot of money.

22:51.837 --> 22:52.970
            I know.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.272
          No. I mean,
          I know that, I think,
          from like...

22:55.274 --> 22:56.841
     I'm gonna get a beer.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.910
               Yes, please.

22:59.912 --> 23:04.048
 But I do know that for a fact
 because I think
 back in the '60s...

23:04.050 --> 23:06.083
          -Holy shit.
          -You okay?

23:06.085 --> 23:07.151
    Phil, are you all right?

23:07.153 --> 23:09.387
I think I'll be
all right long-term.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.622
         Aah!

23:11.624 --> 23:13.724
    -You're sure?
    -No, I'll be all right.
    I'll be all right.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.227
       I think we should call it
       a night, don't you think?

23:16.229 --> 23:18.362
                 So it's on.
                 It's happening?

23:18.364 --> 23:19.964
   What's happening, brother?

23:19.966 --> 23:22.833
 It's on. Billy T's coming.
 He's bringing these two broads.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.201
     Tango is coming here?

23:24.203 --> 23:26.270
             Yeah, he's bringing
             some fucking tarts.
             I don't know...

23:26.272 --> 23:27.471
          It's gonna be awesome.

23:27.473 --> 23:29.340
Who's Billy T?

23:29.342 --> 23:31.308
             Tango. Tango. Yeah.

23:31.310 --> 23:33.177
        He's coming now.

23:33.179 --> 23:35.446
                He's coming now.
                Right now.

23:35.448 --> 23:37.148
Timmy, we should, uh...

23:37.983 --> 23:40.151
We should talk
this out, right?

23:41.453 --> 23:43.721
    Tango is coming, man.
    It's gonna be beautiful.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.990
Yeah, I, uh...

23:45.992 --> 23:48.826
We should probably check
before the evening changes.

23:50.195 --> 23:52.897
Don't break that.
Jude loves it.

23:52.899 --> 23:57.067
        Are you, are you okay?
        Do you need me?
        You need me here?

23:57.069 --> 24:01.238
I don't know.
Not unless you wanna come.
I mean, if you wanna stay, stay.

24:01.240 --> 24:05.676
         No, I'm gonna go.
         I just want you to know
         I'm here for you.

24:05.678 --> 24:08.145
        -Yeah, I'm good.
        -Okay.

24:08.147 --> 24:11.081
      -You're okay?
      -I'm gonna go.
      Yeah, no, it's good.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.520
I'm gonna put you in.
  Put your legs in.

24:16.522 --> 24:17.655
Really nice to meet you.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.457
         There we go.
         There we go.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.325
- Hey!
-         Hello!

24:21.327 --> 24:22.860
         Hey, come on!

24:24.663 --> 24:26.664
- Hey, what's up, man?
-      -Yeah!

24:26.666 --> 24:28.199
- What's going on?
-        -Tango!

24:28.201 --> 24:30.134
        We're doing it?
        We're doing it?

24:30.136 --> 24:32.770
        What's up, man?

24:32.772 --> 24:34.672
  -It's good to see you, bro.
  -It's good to see you.

24:34.674 --> 24:37.808
            Hello. Hi. That was
            the ride of my life.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.276
    I think we should
    do it for America.

24:39.278 --> 24:40.644
             Tango?

24:41.613 --> 24:44.014
       Girls, want a hit
       or something?

24:44.016 --> 24:46.584
          Hi. Thank you so much
          for having us over.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.486
- Hey, thanks for coming.
 -That's so nice.

24:48.488 --> 24:52.823
Cougars are getting
 younger. Like, when I was...
 Like, MILFs were like...

24:52.825 --> 24:55.359
- Now the MILFs are       like 28, right?
-        -Yeah.

24:55.361 --> 24:57.094
And the cougars
    are like...

24:57.096 --> 24:59.630
Can we go in the house,
    is that okay?

24:59.632 --> 25:02.032
      -Is it cool if we go
      in the house?
      -Yeah.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.801
        I'm gonna make the girls
        squirt tonight.

25:05.237 --> 25:06.871
          Easy, easy.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.572
        -Check you out.
        -Use a condom,
        at least.

25:08.574 --> 25:10.841
    -What do you think
    of the other one?
    You like the other one?
    -Beautiful.

25:10.843 --> 25:13.344
Yeah. I mean,
I'd do anything
but we gotta
give him first dibs.

25:13.346 --> 25:16.780
   -No. You guys fuckin'...
   Are you kidding me?
   You... Fuck you, fuck you.
   -Come on, man.

25:16.782 --> 25:19.216
You know what
      his wife said?

25:19.218 --> 25:21.318
You're crazy, man.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.653
Who do you want, man?

25:22.655 --> 25:24.588
No, but I want you
    to be happy.

25:24.590 --> 25:27.458
     What the fuck is this, man?
     Peanut butter and jelly?

25:27.460 --> 25:31.428
It's kind of nice
to just hang out.
And I actually miss
seeing you, man.

25:31.430 --> 25:33.097
           You don't want
           a little side action?

25:33.099 --> 25:34.331
        -I miss you too.
        -Yeah.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.300
Hey, man,
you got some coke on your...

25:38.603 --> 25:40.738
      -Speak of the devil.
      -Yeah.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.673
It's crazy having a kid.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.742
It fucking changes...

25:44.744 --> 25:48.312
I've been wanting
to talk to you about this.
I have these conversations
with you in my head.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.614
             No sleep. No sleep.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.616
               No sleep.

25:52.618 --> 25:54.418
That's part of it.

25:54.420 --> 25:57.121
              I couldn't do it.
              No sleep, man.

25:57.123 --> 26:00.524
 -Yeah, the sleeples--
 -How do you, how do you sleep?

26:00.526 --> 26:02.293
       Yeah, yeah.

26:02.295 --> 26:05.062
             I can't do it.
             I gotta sleep, man.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.397
Also, there's a person--

26:06.399 --> 26:08.032
              I mean, I'm not...

26:08.034 --> 26:11.602
    I can't do that. I can't...
    I gotta sleep, man.

26:11.604 --> 26:13.871
The lack of sleep
fucks with you, man, but...

26:13.873 --> 26:16.607
You know, there's, like,
this human being
just looking up to me to be--

26:16.609 --> 26:18.642
             -Yeah.
             -Yeah.

26:18.644 --> 26:21.011
      -Jesus!
      -Is your wife cool?

26:21.013 --> 26:28.152
 Is she cool? I mean,
 does she let you hang out?
 Does she let you have some time
 and be free and be cool?

26:28.154 --> 26:30.020
               Can you hang out?

26:30.022 --> 26:32.489
She's great, you know,
all bullshit aside.

26:32.491 --> 26:34.792
       -You're not trapped?
       -No.

26:34.794 --> 26:37.194
       -No, you know--
       -I can't fucking
       handle that, man.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.363
You know,
              I can't fucking...

26:39.365 --> 26:42.366
           I can't handle
           being trapped, man,
           you know what I mean?

26:47.539 --> 26:49.640
 -Whoo!
 -I did it, I did it, I did it!

26:49.642 --> 26:51.008
Just give me
one good thing.

26:52.010 --> 26:53.110
                Ray-ray!

26:56.182 --> 26:57.381
              Oh!

27:09.327 --> 27:10.728
                 Whoa!

27:10.730 --> 27:12.096
             What are you doing?

27:12.098 --> 27:14.298
        Uh...

27:14.300 --> 27:15.733
     Just digging
     for something.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.534
             -Cool.
             -Yeah.

27:17.536 --> 27:20.904
         For something?
         What kind of something?

27:20.906 --> 27:22.539
         -What's that?
         -What?

27:22.541 --> 27:26.744
I just found uh,
some stuff earlier.
I found like a bone and...

27:27.245 --> 27:29.380
       Yeah.

27:29.382 --> 27:33.651
You're amazing. Look at you.
What are you, Fred Astaire?
You're gonna tap dance for me,
you fucking poopie?

27:33.653 --> 27:39.490
You gonna fucking...
Get in the pool
and fucking do a tap dance,
motherfucker.

27:39.492 --> 27:43.560
It's not... This isn't my house,
so I'm not moving it all out
I'm just...

27:43.562 --> 27:45.229
          -This isn't?
          -No.

27:45.231 --> 27:48.932
My wife and I
are staying here
for a few weeks.

27:50.035 --> 27:51.301
            -Sweet.
            -Yeah.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.303
      -That's a good deal.
      -It's a great deal.

27:53.305 --> 27:54.872
             Yeah.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.280
                I wanna help you
                find the body.

28:05.784 --> 28:07.051
Well, there's a shovel
right there.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.019
               Great, that's all
               I needed to hear.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.856
           <i> Chica! Chica! Chica!</i>

28:13.925 --> 28:16.126
Yeah, where is that <i> chica?</i>

28:16.128 --> 28:17.194
                I don't know.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.495
Get that <i> chica</i> over here.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.631
        -Hey, hey, hey. Hey!
        -Hey.

28:39.417 --> 28:42.352
   -Yeah, that's nice.
   -You're bringing it, huh?

28:42.354 --> 28:44.054
        I could do this.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.456
               I got it.

28:52.798 --> 28:54.398
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

29:02.274 --> 29:06.310
-Oh, it's colder than I thought!
-Hey, man! Don't try
and have sex with me.

29:06.312 --> 29:09.446
Oh, I didn't know
  it was time to show off.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.057
                   Oh, that
                   wasn't funny.

29:47.887 --> 29:49.186
Where's <i> chica?</i>

30:09.675 --> 30:11.241
Hey, give me that...

30:17.715 --> 30:19.149
       Hey.

30:22.287 --> 30:25.222
I gotta show this to Ray.
He's gonna lose his shit.

30:25.224 --> 30:27.424
 -What did you find?
 -Ray, I found a shoe, buddy!

30:27.426 --> 30:30.160
- A what?
-         -Ray! Ray!

30:30.662 --> 30:32.462
Ray! Ray.

30:33.431 --> 30:35.165
Ray, I found a shoe.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.567
  Hey, man,
  that's awesome.

30:36.569 --> 30:38.936
  Dude, I found a shoe.
  It was right by the gun, so...

30:38.938 --> 30:40.470
     -That's great. Let me
     check it out, man.
     -Yeah, man.

30:40.472 --> 30:42.239
      -It's unbelievable.
      -That's awesome, bro.

30:42.241 --> 30:45.776
     Yeah, that was prob--
     Oh, no, no, no! No.

30:45.778 --> 30:47.611
         Oh, man, Ray.

30:47.613 --> 30:51.148
- What do you got there?
  You got a joint?
  -Yeah.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.250
              You threw the shoe
              in the pool, man.

30:53.551 --> 30:55.986
                        Oh, man.

30:55.988 --> 30:57.754
        -How's it doing?
        -Yeah, it's good.

30:57.756 --> 31:00.057
    -Smoting...
    Smoking up marijuana...
    -Smoting?

31:00.059 --> 31:03.927
 I think if there's any clue
 that says that there's somebody
 out there, Ray, it's this.

31:03.929 --> 31:06.029
  ...smoke the dutchie often,
  if you know what I mean.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.432
              Who would
              just throw this...

31:08.434 --> 31:10.067
              It's fucking nuts.

31:10.069 --> 31:13.203
I can't even understand
 what you're saying anymore.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.038
         All right,
         I'm gonna hit the sack.

31:17.810 --> 31:20.143
                All right, guys.

31:20.145 --> 31:21.411
          All right,
          good night, everybody.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.714
        It's like you got Jekyll
        and then you got Hyde.

31:23.716 --> 31:27.184
- And then you got Jekyll,
and then you get Hyde.
- Stay as long as you want.
Enjoy the night.

31:27.186 --> 31:29.419
   -You know what I mean?
   You punk rock?
   -I don't wanna look at it.

31:29.754 --> 31:31.622
     Oh, shit.

31:31.624 --> 31:36.059
- I'm gonna fucking...
 -I will whip this at you!

31:40.699 --> 31:44.134
- Okay, okay, okay.

33:08.854 --> 33:10.787
- This is a crossroads.
-  -Mm-hmm.

33:10.789 --> 33:13.757
- This is
 a very important--
 -It's not a crossroads.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.492
The kid's three years old.

33:15.494 --> 33:18.829
- But, darling...
-    -It's not   the crossroads of his life.

33:18.831 --> 33:20.497
- Right.
-         -Yes.

33:20.499 --> 33:24.434
    You think the best education
    he could possibly get
    is in a public school?

33:24.436 --> 33:29.206
          No, actually, I don't.
          But sometimes I think
          it's a compromise.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.308
What? No.
It doesn't have to be
a compromise.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.210
       -It is. Marriage
       is a compromise.
       -Why?

33:33.212 --> 33:34.945
  -Well, life's a compromise.
  -Yes, but--

33:34.947 --> 33:38.015
     -Life's a compromise.
     -Can we stop talking
     in platitudes?

33:38.017 --> 33:39.783
     -Life's a compromise.
     -Please? Look.

33:39.785 --> 33:43.887
We think it's important
for him to have
the best education
that he can have

33:43.889 --> 33:45.322
    -and I know you do too.
    -Mm-hmm.

33:45.324 --> 33:47.557
And so now you're under
the cover of your marriage.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.459
       -And Tim does too.
       -I...

33:49.461 --> 33:53.630
Tim is prejudiced
because he works
in the public school system

33:53.632 --> 33:54.931
and that's
the difference.

33:54.933 --> 33:56.666
 That's kind of harsh.
 I don't think he's prejudiced.

33:56.668 --> 33:58.435
-He just believes in the pu--
-It's not harsh, it's the truth.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.971
- I feel like the voices     are getting really...
-      -Mama!

34:00.973 --> 34:03.807
    -I'm sorry, buddy. Yeah?
    -I'm sorry.

34:03.809 --> 34:06.576
        Oh, wait. I think I know
        what I need to do.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.411
I know what
I need to do.

34:13.051 --> 34:16.887
  I think I have 15 blueberries
  and you have 14.

34:16.889 --> 34:20.389
No, I have 15 too.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.792
            -You do?
            -Yeah.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.760
                Look, I have 16.

34:25.362 --> 34:27.431
            We're getting a lot
            of anti-oxidants.

34:29.033 --> 34:31.134
Okay.

34:47.985 --> 34:50.219
- <i> Knock, knock.</i>
-   -<i> Who's there?</i>

34:50.222 --> 34:52.522
          <i> -Orange.</i>
          <i> -Orange who?</i>

34:52.524 --> 34:54.257
         <i> -Knock, knock.</i>
         <i> -Who's there?</i>

34:54.259 --> 34:55.992
          <i> -Banana.</i>
          <i> -Banana who?</i>

34:55.994 --> 34:57.894
         -Knock, knock.
         -Who's there?

34:57.896 --> 34:59.563
          -Banana.
          -Banana who?

35:00.431 --> 35:03.633
                 Didn't you glad
                 I didn't say...

35:03.635 --> 35:04.935
Orange?

35:04.937 --> 35:06.670
           I'm just waiting
           to get my life back.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.305
What does that mean?

35:08.307 --> 35:12.943
    When did it come back?
    When do you go from being...

35:12.945 --> 35:16.246
   I mean, you know,
   it's the great joy of my life
   to be...

35:16.248 --> 35:18.882
       -I did it.
       -I know you did.
       Thank you, buddy.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.283
           To be mom.

35:20.285 --> 35:23.019
 But when am I mom and...
 All right, you wanna step in?

35:23.021 --> 35:24.988
          I'm gonna do this one.
          All right, step in.

35:24.990 --> 35:28.692
       I'm asking you
       when did you feel like
       you got back to yourself?

35:28.694 --> 35:31.061
When I divorced
your father.

35:31.063 --> 35:33.096
             I knew you were
             gonna say that.

35:33.098 --> 35:34.397
        Can you zip these up?

35:34.399 --> 35:36.833
No, I'm not
recommending divorce.

35:36.835 --> 35:39.503
 No, I thought you were
 gonna say, "I'm not kidding."
 I'm like, I know you're not.

35:39.505 --> 35:41.705
        Can you zip these up
        for me? You know
        how to do that part.

35:41.707 --> 35:47.577
But there was something truthful
about my having
my own life again.

35:48.379 --> 35:50.413
Doing pretty good
for an old man.

35:50.415 --> 35:53.283
- I feel like an old man.

35:53.285 --> 35:54.651
              <i> It's hard to have</i>
               <i> a separate life.</i>

35:54.653 --> 35:57.587
    -You do, though?
    -Yeah, I feel like I do.

35:57.589 --> 36:00.056
       But I think
       it's the hardest thing,
       somehow, getting married.

36:00.058 --> 36:05.262
   It's like, well am I a couple
   or am I still the person,
   you know?

36:05.264 --> 36:07.130
                  It's really...

36:07.132 --> 36:13.370
   It's key to remain the person
   that brought something
   to a relationship.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.639
          And being in love,
          man, we being in love.

36:15.641 --> 36:20.911
        What is that?
        Getting what you want
        or is it giving somebody
        what they want?

36:22.446 --> 36:25.382
           Sacrificing, if you
           want to call it that.

36:25.384 --> 36:26.883
<i> Two, three.</i>

36:26.885 --> 36:28.451
            -Cheese!
            -Cheese!

36:28.453 --> 36:30.287
   Okay, you wanna come down?

36:30.588 --> 36:31.521
           Uh...

36:31.523 --> 36:33.423
      Here, you want me
      to give you a push?

36:33.425 --> 36:35.959
      Okay, I'll give you
      a little push.

36:37.895 --> 36:39.596
         Whoa, oh, whoa!

36:39.598 --> 36:44.201
     Can I take a picture of you
     with Grandma and Pop-pop?

36:44.203 --> 36:47.504
      No? I gotta take a picture
      for Daddy.

37:16.735 --> 37:17.934
                  All right.

37:39.024 --> 37:41.591
        -Hey, neighbor.
        -Oh, hey.

37:41.593 --> 37:45.228
 -Sorry, I should have called.
 -No. Stop. How are you?

37:45.230 --> 37:47.664
        I'm good, I just brought
        something up for Lee.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.966
Oh, she and the boy
are gone for the weekend.

37:49.968 --> 37:52.369
        -Oh, they are?
        -Yeah. Oh, okay.

37:52.371 --> 37:54.604
Wanna get a cup
of coffee or something?
You wanna come in?

37:54.606 --> 37:57.440
           Uh, I don't wanna be
           any trouble.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.509
Better than not
doing anything.

38:00.745 --> 38:02.012
Here you go,
my friend.

38:02.747 --> 38:04.247
               That's all I get?

38:05.717 --> 38:07.617
   -That's all that's left?
   -Yeah, that's all that...

38:07.619 --> 38:10.120
     -I mean, it's yours
     if you want it, but...
     -Nah.

38:10.122 --> 38:12.389
Sorry about that,
it's my friend's.
I don't do cocaine, actually.

38:12.391 --> 38:14.491
     -I don't either.
     -Yeah, I'm a weed guy.

38:14.493 --> 38:18.395
     You know, if you need
     a little bit of help
     digging your swimming pool
     down there,

38:18.397 --> 38:20.363
        I got a brother-in-law
        that does that business.

38:20.365 --> 38:22.666
Oh, no, the...
Last night.

38:22.668 --> 38:25.035
No, we were just
goofing around, just...

38:25.903 --> 38:27.637
         -Yeah?
         -Yeah. I uh...

38:27.639 --> 38:30.006
I'd found...
I'd been doing
a little gardening for Julia

38:30.008 --> 38:33.043
and I found some stuff
and, you know,
it was interesting.

38:34.478 --> 38:37.881
Doing some Indiana Jones
stuff, I guess.

38:37.883 --> 38:41.685
       Well, a lot of weird shit
       happened around here.

38:41.687 --> 38:43.153
Man, you said it.

38:43.155 --> 38:44.921
That's the stuff
I like to get into.

38:45.756 --> 38:46.856
                   Oh, really?

38:47.425 --> 38:49.426
Yeah, it's fun.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.996
                Well, sometimes
                not so much fun.

38:52.998 --> 38:57.334
      You want all those spirits
      to come up here
      and join your family?

38:57.336 --> 39:01.438
Well, that's interesting.
That was kind of the debate.
'Cause Lee said
not to mess with it.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.506
    -Yeah.
    -She said it was kind of
    none of my business.

39:03.508 --> 39:06.343
But my thought is like,
there's something in me,
and I don't know
if you can relate to this,

39:06.345 --> 39:11.147
but there's something,
if there's something down there,
part of me has got to know
what it is.

39:11.149 --> 39:17.087
Well, I know what it is,
but there ain't no way
I'm gonna go digging down there.

39:17.089 --> 39:21.891
- Right? Have all that shit
   come back on my family.

39:21.893 --> 39:25.195
           You don't wanna find
           anything down there,
           believe me.

39:31.235 --> 39:32.435
Yeah, I know.

39:32.437 --> 39:36.106
    The Chicano Hall of Fame
    is down there.

39:38.509 --> 39:41.277
 Okay. Thanks for stopping by.

41:06.598 --> 41:09.299
<i> And I keep thinking</i>
   <i> the older I get</i>
   <i> the more I'm gonna know,</i>

41:09.301 --> 41:13.903
     and I don't,
     I'm just getting older
     and fatter, and, like,
     more broken down.

41:16.073 --> 41:17.474
        And that's true.

41:17.476 --> 41:19.509
     You know when you talk
     to like an old man,
     or at least for me,

41:19.511 --> 41:22.745
you know, they'll say like,
"It's weird when we talk
because I feel your age,"

41:22.747 --> 41:24.814
   and then I look
   in the mirror and I'm not.

41:24.816 --> 41:27.517
        -That's starting
        to happen.
        -Oh, really?

41:27.519 --> 41:32.388
With... I'm like... This is...
I was with two 16-year-old boys
and we were, like,
goofing around,

41:32.390 --> 41:33.756
           Why were you with
           two 16-year-old boys?

41:33.758 --> 41:35.625
     -It was a work thing.
     I'm a teacher.
     -Oh, okay.

41:35.627 --> 41:39.095
      But we were, like,
      having fun,
      and, like, laughing
      and doing bits.

41:39.097 --> 41:42.165
We were doing like,
"Ooh, kill 'em, kill 'em."
and they're like, "You don't..."

41:42.167 --> 41:44.033
       And we were like,
       all laughing.

41:44.035 --> 41:47.804
   And I saw the reflection
   of this, like, of the car
   in the

41:47.806 --> 41:50.406
      and I was so old,
      and they were so...

41:50.408 --> 41:54.077
     And I had that thought
     of like, wow!

41:54.079 --> 41:57.747
  But I didn't feel different
  when we were having fun.

41:57.749 --> 42:00.917
  And that made me feel like,
  I am gonna die.

42:39.323 --> 42:40.490
             -Hey!
             -Yeah?

42:40.492 --> 42:42.425
I found something!
I found something!

42:42.427 --> 42:43.760
        Ooh!

42:44.862 --> 42:46.095
       Holy shit.

42:50.234 --> 42:51.968
I just found a bag of bones.

42:53.037 --> 42:54.237
          Oh, my God.

42:54.239 --> 42:56.072
So somebody
had bones...

42:56.074 --> 42:59.008
             Chopped them up,
             put them in a bag,
             put them in here.

42:59.944 --> 43:03.079
Yeah, here.
It's an awesome find.

43:03.081 --> 43:07.850
     This is so cool. It's like,
     the most weird
     Easter egg hunt.

43:07.852 --> 43:10.186
     -Oh, God.
     -Good job, good find.

43:10.188 --> 43:11.654
           Thank you.

43:11.889 --> 43:13.089
              Mom?

43:28.439 --> 43:29.772
              Mom?

43:40.986 --> 43:43.119
           Okay, give me a kiss.
           Mwah.

43:43.121 --> 43:46.389
-All right, you're gonna play
with Grandma and Grandpa, okay?
-Okay.

43:46.391 --> 43:48.625
        -I love you.
        -I love you too.

43:48.627 --> 43:51.060
                       Have fun!

43:51.062 --> 43:52.495
                   Bye, Grandma.

44:03.408 --> 44:04.741
              Hi.

44:04.743 --> 44:06.843
       -Hey. Are you Lee?
       -I am.

44:06.845 --> 44:08.945
        Oh, good.
        I'm so glad I found you.

44:08.947 --> 44:13.316
-The GPS took me...
-I know.
It always goes up Deerpath
and then you can't get through.

44:13.318 --> 44:15.018
              I know, I'm sorry.

44:15.020 --> 44:16.619
      So am I.

44:16.621 --> 44:18.254
Where are you going?

44:18.256 --> 44:20.056
 -Big Brackwood.
 I'll tell you how to get there.
 -Oh, awesome.

44:26.030 --> 44:27.630
Was that your house?

44:27.632 --> 44:30.333
        No, no.
        I mean, I wish.

44:30.335 --> 44:33.903
 Well, I don't know if I wish.
 I mean, it was my mom's house.

44:33.905 --> 44:36.172
      -It's really nice.
      -It is really nice.

44:36.174 --> 44:38.508
   My house is not very nice.

44:38.510 --> 44:39.642
       No.

44:39.644 --> 44:41.344
   No. We live on the east side.

44:41.346 --> 44:42.979
    -Oh, okay.
    -Yeah, Atwater Village.

44:42.981 --> 44:44.514
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I know where that is.

44:44.516 --> 44:48.151
      Yeah, we don't even
      live in a house.
      We live in a duplex.

44:48.153 --> 44:51.654
-That's still nice.
You can pretend to have a house.
-Yeah, I know, right?

44:51.656 --> 44:54.390
    Sort of. I think we thought
    we were gonna move out of it
    and get a house

44:54.392 --> 44:57.126
   several years ago,
   but it hasn't panned out yet.

44:57.128 --> 44:58.995
I kind of like
driving around over here

44:58.997 --> 45:02.498
because I can sort of pretend
that I live in one of these
giant houses.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.567
               Right?

45:04.569 --> 45:07.503
But I always wonder
if I would be happier
if I lived in one of these,
instead of an apartment?

45:07.505 --> 45:11.674
      I think I read this study,
      or my husband told me
      about this study,

45:11.676 --> 45:13.509
     because we talk about
     this stuff a lot,

45:13.511 --> 45:18.047
   that they did for Harvard
   or something
   where they said you actually,

45:18.049 --> 45:22.285
        people with money
        actually are happier,
        live marginally happier,

45:22.287 --> 45:26.823
    and then it kind of plateaus
    and they're as unhappy
    as everybody else,

45:26.825 --> 45:30.626
     but they are
     a little bit happier.

45:30.628 --> 45:34.230
      Where are my two
      favorite munchkins?

45:34.232 --> 45:36.199
              -Hi.
              -Hi.

45:36.201 --> 45:38.901
  -How are you doing, darling?
  -Hi, Lee. Good.

45:38.903 --> 45:40.803
 -So good to see you.
 -Hey, guys, you remember Lee?

45:40.805 --> 45:44.373
Oh, my God, you're all wet.
I can't even hug you.

45:44.375 --> 45:45.875
High-five. Two hands.

45:45.877 --> 45:47.643
         You remember
         Auntie Lee?

45:47.645 --> 45:49.846
   On the side. In the hole.

45:49.848 --> 45:51.080
        You've got soul.

45:51.082 --> 45:53.683
    -Hi, how are you?
    -Good. Good to see you.

45:53.685 --> 45:55.318
     -Good to see you too.
     -Oh, this is Lucy.

45:55.320 --> 45:58.554
     -Hi, I'm Lucy.
     Nice to meet you.
     -Hi. Nice to meet you.

45:58.556 --> 46:00.690
         -It's amazing.
         -Wow.

46:04.428 --> 46:05.795
        -Here you go.
        -Thank you.

46:05.797 --> 46:07.296
- Cheers, you guys.
-        -Cheers.

46:07.298 --> 46:11.334
            I have been counting
            the minutes
            to this reunion.

46:11.336 --> 46:12.668
You wanna
cheers me or no?

46:12.670 --> 46:14.337
         -Yeah, cheers.
         -Okay.

46:14.339 --> 46:18.174
You, if you would give
that to me, I would win too.

46:18.176 --> 46:20.810
            -Okay.
            -I win!

46:20.812 --> 46:22.678
       -How is he doing?
       -He's so good.

46:22.680 --> 46:24.347
      I wanna eat him every day.

46:24.349 --> 46:25.548
You could have bought him.

46:25.550 --> 46:27.950
     You know he needs some time
     with Grandma and Pop-pop,

46:27.952 --> 46:30.920
            and Mommy
            needs some time too.

46:30.922 --> 46:32.789
      -How old is he now?
      -Three.

46:33.490 --> 46:35.258
      -Oh.
      -Yeah, it goes fast.

46:35.260 --> 46:37.360
 -Yeah, it's been a long time.
 -Yeah.

46:37.362 --> 46:42.899
 I mean, part of me wishes
 we could have someone,
 you know, full-time, live-in...

46:42.901 --> 46:46.035
  You could do it. I mean,
  we just found her, you know?

46:46.037 --> 46:49.639
   Um, she knew
   somebody from work, so...

46:49.641 --> 46:52.341
           Do you mind if I ask
           how much you pay her?

46:52.343 --> 46:54.110
         -Very little.
         -Yeah.

46:54.112 --> 46:56.813
  But lives in the guest house
  it's kind of a big draw.

46:56.815 --> 46:59.949
There's kind of a deal.
She's like an actress,

46:59.951 --> 47:02.952
and she is auditioning.
We're kind of flexible.

47:02.954 --> 47:05.621
It's not...
It's an interesting...

47:05.623 --> 47:08.691
I think she's great.
I think she fits in really well.
The kids love her.

47:08.693 --> 47:12.895
Here's the, here's the thing.
Tell me how you feel about this.

47:12.897 --> 47:18.034
We are gonna go to Costa Rica
on a family vacation.

47:18.036 --> 47:19.602
It was gonna be us
and the kids.

47:19.604 --> 47:22.338
    -It's still gonna be us
    and the kids.
    -I'm excited about it.

47:22.340 --> 47:26.909
But suddenly, Bob thinks
that Lucy should come.

47:26.911 --> 47:29.412
-No. Okay, here's what happened.
-For the whole time.

47:29.414 --> 47:31.480
     Here's what happened.
     Squitch says...

47:33.250 --> 47:37.253
    -What do you think about
    Costa Rica, right?
    -Uh-huh.

47:37.255 --> 47:40.756
      We penciled in Costa Rica,
      starting on the 10th,

47:40.758 --> 47:43.626
   because that was the week
   that seemed like
   it was gonna be open.

47:43.628 --> 47:45.995
Everybody agreed
to the 10th.

47:45.997 --> 47:48.464
   -My schedule doesn't work
   like your schedule works.
   -The 10th is good.

47:48.466 --> 47:52.535
   -I know what it is three,
   four months in advance.
   -I started planning...
   Well, it does. It can.

47:52.537 --> 47:53.870
It can, it can
if you want it to.

47:53.872 --> 47:56.339
   -It can't. It can't.
   -It can if you want it to.

47:56.341 --> 47:58.374
   -Okay, sure,
   if I wanna call the client...
   -If you communicate...

47:58.376 --> 48:01.310
...and say,
"We're gonna drop the account.
Sorry, we're not ready,

48:01.312 --> 48:03.379
                 "and I'm going
                 to Costa Rica."

48:03.381 --> 48:06.282
If you communicate
and you talk to me
when you find out
that it's not a good date,

48:06.284 --> 48:07.917
you tell me then,
so I can change things.

48:07.919 --> 48:09.218
            So I have a project,
            that went over,

48:09.220 --> 48:11.320
               and we've got
               a lot of options.

48:11.322 --> 48:14.557
        One of the options is,
        we can postpone the trip
        and we can go...

48:14.559 --> 48:18.294
Why don't you have
just like a nice night
and have some, like, you time

48:18.296 --> 48:21.631
     -and, like, read a,
     read a book...
     -What does that mean?

48:21.633 --> 48:26.068
I feel so shitty.
I don't even know
what I'm saying to you.

48:26.070 --> 48:28.304
         You're saying
         you don't wanna go out.

48:28.306 --> 48:30.973
 -I'm saying I can't, I can't.
 -I know, I know.

48:30.975 --> 48:34.010
  I was really
  looking forward to tonight.

48:34.012 --> 48:38.314
Like, on a level
        that I can't even
        describe to you, but...

48:38.316 --> 48:40.950
<i> You sure you can't do it?</i>
  <i> You can't push it?</i>

48:40.952 --> 48:45.454
 <i> I know, and I'm supposed</i>
 <i> to just let you off the hook,</i>
 <i> but I'm being so selfish</i>
 <i> and just pushing for my needs.</i>

48:45.456 --> 48:49.725
<i>I was so excited to see you</i>
<i>and I wanted to be</i>
<i>able to do it,</i>

48:49.727 --> 48:53.029
  <i> but I haven't done anything</i>
  <i> for like two months.</i>

48:53.031 --> 48:54.630
<i> Maybe you need to get out.</i>

48:59.603 --> 49:01.771
             -Hey.
             -Hey.

49:01.773 --> 49:04.340
  -What do you say we call it?
  -Call it?

49:04.342 --> 49:06.575
Yeah. I'll buy you some dinner
as a thank you.

49:07.377 --> 49:10.179
            -Yeah.
            -You in?

49:10.181 --> 49:12.381
           My clothes are
           pretty dirty, though.

49:12.383 --> 49:14.083
I'll find you
some clean clothes.

49:15.319 --> 49:16.619
             -Okay.
             -Okay.

49:17.888 --> 49:19.322
             -Good.
             -Good.

49:40.177 --> 49:42.111
I want...

49:48.618 --> 49:50.019
             Whoa.

49:51.288 --> 49:53.589
      -What's up, Timmy?
      -Hey, Phil, my boy.

49:54.624 --> 49:55.958
         -How are you?
         -How are you?

49:55.960 --> 49:58.260
       -Good.
       -How was the rest
       of the night?

49:58.262 --> 50:00.830
   -Great, and Tango came by,
   it was fun.
   -Yeah?

50:00.832 --> 50:02.665
             What you up to?
             What are you doing?

50:02.667 --> 50:06.335
Just, uh, I was just
  in the neighborhood,
  heading to soccer practice.

50:06.337 --> 50:08.838
- You're dressed like Ray.
-    -Hey, Tim?

50:08.840 --> 50:10.439
        These don't fit.

50:10.441 --> 50:12.808
I don't wanna go
in the closet, but...

50:12.810 --> 50:14.143
         Let's get you
         something else to wear.

50:14.511 --> 50:15.745
             Okay.

50:15.747 --> 50:17.380
           -Hi.
           -Hi there.

50:17.382 --> 50:19.382
- Thank you.
-        -Yeah.

50:34.998 --> 50:36.265
<i> Take anything you want.</i>

50:36.267 --> 50:37.666
     -Just whatever? Uh...
     -Honestly.

50:37.668 --> 50:39.935
Yeah, just grab anything
and I'll meet you downstairs.

50:39.937 --> 50:41.737
           -Anything?
           -Anything.

50:43.740 --> 50:45.074
          Thank you.

51:02.325 --> 51:03.692
       -Tim.
       -What's up, man?

51:03.694 --> 51:05.661
 Listen, I got to uh...
 Just talk to me for a second.

51:05.663 --> 51:08.330
      Phil, I want to clean off
      that table so I won't have
      to do it later.

51:08.332 --> 51:11.801
Listen, I wanna talk to you
because you're not
yourself right now,

51:11.803 --> 51:13.636
you're like in this
other head space,

51:13.638 --> 51:16.806
and, uh, I just wanna
talk to you about, like...

51:16.808 --> 51:19.341
I feel like we should
jut go out for dinner,
like, just drop these guys.

51:19.343 --> 51:21.644
              I have plans, man.
              I'm going out
              with my friend.

51:21.646 --> 51:23.779
  -No, but it would be fun
  It would be just you and me.
  -Yeah.

51:23.781 --> 51:27.783
And we can kind of shed this
because I feel like you're,
whoo, you know what I mean?

51:27.785 --> 51:31.420
You're just
in this other place
and I just wanna
bring you back.

51:31.422 --> 51:34.223
    What do you think
    is going on here?
    What are you implying, Phil?

51:34.225 --> 51:37.560
 -I don't know what's going on.
 -I made a friend
 and I'm going out
 to eat with her.

51:37.562 --> 51:41.464
Yeah, I'm not
involved with this.
As a matter of fact, when...

51:41.466 --> 51:44.533
I'm friends with your wife.
I know your kid.

51:44.535 --> 51:49.338
             Phil, Phil.
             You're a good dude.
             But I've known you
             for two years.

51:49.340 --> 51:53.008
      -Relax. I'm fine.
      I'm a man. Okay?
      -I'm just saying...

51:53.010 --> 51:58.247
I'm just saying, for
when I'm out with your wife
and, you know, when we're
on double dates,

51:58.249 --> 52:00.116
I don't wanna be
an accomplice to this.

52:00.118 --> 52:01.817
                 There's not...
                 Okay, stop.

52:01.819 --> 52:06.789
Your... That coat looks
ridiculous, it doesn't
even button properly.

52:06.791 --> 52:10.426
And the hat, you know,
it's practically the summer.
You're gonna be boiling.

52:10.428 --> 52:12.962
<i>By the time we actually</i>

52:12.964 --> 52:15.831
got the divorce itself,
it was over, so...

52:16.867 --> 52:18.134
            Were you devastated?

52:18.136 --> 52:21.804
Oh, I was,
I was a fucking mess.
I was, you know,

52:21.806 --> 52:23.973
sobbing into the sink
every morning.

52:23.975 --> 52:27.076
You know, like,
it was, it was just terrible.

52:27.078 --> 52:33.215
But, um, since then
it's been, you know,
revelatory, you know.

52:33.217 --> 52:36.719
And life is someplace
where I never found it before.

52:36.721 --> 52:43.225
You know, you live a whole...
You grow up with your parents,
and you have roommates,
and you do all this stuff

52:43.227 --> 52:47.930
and all of a sudden
you're, you're exactly
what you wanna be, sort of.

52:47.932 --> 52:50.733
    -Now.
    -Now. Really, it's uh...

52:52.135 --> 52:56.238
It's pretty amazing, you know?
No compromises.

52:56.240 --> 52:58.274
--No compromises.

52:58.276 --> 53:03.879
Nothing that really requires
anything but your own desires.

53:03.881 --> 53:06.615
The thing is,
you just gotta figure out
what they are.

53:51.596 --> 53:53.662
<i> When you decide</i>
      <i> what you're interested in</i>

53:53.664 --> 53:56.632
          and it's,
          if you're not seeking,
          then there's no part,

53:56.634 --> 53:59.435
        and you are
        in a moment of your life
        where you are seeking.

53:59.437 --> 54:02.271
     -Mm-hmm.
     -So something like
     taking ayahuasca,

54:02.273 --> 54:04.406
  which would be
  really scary for me right now,

54:05.175 --> 54:06.976
            is really exciting
            and really scary.

54:06.978 --> 54:11.313
Because if it shifts
everything up for you,
well, this is the time to do it.

54:11.315 --> 54:14.750
      Well, I'm not set in
      anything right now.
      You're like
      set in your thing.

54:14.752 --> 54:19.822
              I think what is,
              is everything
              that excites me
              is what he's doing

54:19.824 --> 54:23.859
        and not how
        I'm reacting to it,
        and not how
        it's affecting my brain.

54:23.861 --> 54:27.329
 It feels like
 what's happening to me
 and what's happening to my wife

54:27.331 --> 54:28.964
         kind of doesn't matter.

54:28.966 --> 54:32.868
  -Mm-hmm.
  -And there's a bit of a loss
  that happens between us

54:32.870 --> 54:35.871
       because our thing,
       our connection, our love,

54:35.873 --> 54:40.676
  and I know it's wrong
  and I know we always like...
  We have, like, rules of, like,
  make sure we always connect,

54:40.678 --> 54:45.014
       it's just so much more
       exciting to put
       everything into that kid,

54:45.016 --> 54:48.183
           in their love,
           in their development,
           in their thought,

54:48.185 --> 54:51.687
      and, you know,
      you lose yourself in that.

54:52.255 --> 54:53.822
All right?

54:54.858 --> 54:57.059
Hi. Can I just sit
at the bar?

54:57.061 --> 54:59.061
         -Yeah, please.
         -Thank you.

55:01.031 --> 55:03.332
    -How you doing?
    -Good, good, thank you.

55:03.334 --> 55:04.733
Want a drink?

55:07.370 --> 55:08.904
       Do you need help?

55:08.906 --> 55:13.709
Oh, no, thank you.
Um, I'll have a martini
with a twist.

55:13.711 --> 55:17.146
       Wait, I haven't seen this
       in so long,
       I eat here all the time.

55:17.148 --> 55:18.814
                   What are you
                   gonna get?

55:18.816 --> 55:22.818
- I was thinking about...
-        uh...

55:23.787 --> 55:25.321
   -Do you guys have burgers?
   -Yeah, we do.

55:25.323 --> 55:27.022
     I don't see it on the menu.
     Awesome.

55:27.024 --> 55:28.757
           -Here you go.
           -Perfect.

55:28.759 --> 55:30.225
        You have beautiful eyes.

55:30.227 --> 55:33.562
   -Thank you. I'm just gonna
   scoot over here.
   -What color are they?

55:33.564 --> 55:37.800
Um, I think they're hazel.
I think that's what it says
on my driver's license.

55:45.276 --> 55:46.675
Hey.

55:51.114 --> 55:52.648
Uh-oh.

55:53.350 --> 55:55.050
Brian, what are
you doing, man?

55:55.052 --> 55:57.353
  -I'm just coming...
  She was telling me about...
  -You good?

55:57.355 --> 55:58.954
      No, I'm good. Yeah.

55:58.956 --> 56:02.024
     What, are these chips?
     Why did you get chips?

56:02.026 --> 56:04.560
   -I'm enjoying some chips.
   Do you want some?
   -Yeah.

56:05.328 --> 56:07.129
Eat some chips.

56:07.131 --> 56:08.630
Did you eat
enough tonight?

56:09.933 --> 56:12.601
      -No?
      -A little. I, uh...

56:12.603 --> 56:14.470
Maybe one too many
to drink, huh?

56:14.472 --> 56:15.804
       I don't think so.

56:15.806 --> 56:17.406
Mmm, leave some.

56:18.808 --> 56:20.142
      What are you doing?

56:22.145 --> 56:23.445
               I'm just texting
               my husband.

56:23.447 --> 56:25.948
    -Wait, those are haz...
    You're married?
    -Mm-hmm.

56:26.649 --> 56:27.750
          Since when?

56:29.352 --> 56:32.654
                   Since 2004.

56:32.656 --> 56:34.656
         I'm so sorry.
         I'm so sorry.

56:34.658 --> 56:36.825
       Let's go, bud.
       Come on outside,
       let's go.

56:36.827 --> 56:38.327
Excuse me.

56:38.329 --> 56:41.130
     -Nice meeting you.
     -Nice to meet you too.

56:41.132 --> 56:43.699
              She's really
              not interested.
              Come on, let's go.

56:43.701 --> 56:47.169
 -Brian, it's time to leave.
 It's time to leave.
 -No. Please, please. Seriously.

56:47.171 --> 56:49.471
- Really?
   -It's time to leave.
   Let's go.

56:49.473 --> 56:51.540
   Come on, out the door.
   Brian, I'm serious. Relax.

56:51.542 --> 56:52.941
No, no, man,
I'm serious.

56:52.943 --> 56:53.942
Listen, dude.

56:53.944 --> 56:55.844
- Why are you doing this?
- Because...

56:59.049 --> 57:01.383
- Oh, fuck!
        -Oh, my God.

57:01.385 --> 57:03.452
- You!
-        -Fuck you.

57:03.454 --> 57:05.287
- Would you just      go home?
-       -No.

57:05.289 --> 57:07.089
Fuck!

57:08.958 --> 57:10.659
         Fucking loser.

57:10.661 --> 57:12.928
- You okay, dude?
  -Honey, will you just

57:12.930 --> 57:15.597
- get him a cab          or something?
-           Yeah.

57:16.232 --> 57:18.033
      I apologize. Sorry.

57:18.635 --> 57:20.335
Here you go.

57:20.337 --> 57:25.007
Thank you. Okay. I feel like
this is gonna hurt a little bit.
Can I see it?

57:25.009 --> 57:26.742
    -Can you take this away?
    -It's gonna be fine.

57:26.744 --> 57:29.278
      -Can you just take it
      for a second?
      -Sure.

57:29.280 --> 57:32.047
               Okay. Oh, yeah,
               yeah, yeah. Okay.

57:32.049 --> 57:34.783
         This is like a total...

57:34.785 --> 57:37.519
It's fine, honestly.
It's really not a big deal.

57:37.521 --> 57:39.254
-And you're gonna need stitches.
-No, I'm not.

57:39.256 --> 57:41.757
    -Oh, yes. Yes, you are.
    No, you really are.
    -No, I'm not.

57:41.759 --> 57:44.660
I'm not going to a hospital.
I hate hospitals.
I fucking hate them.

57:44.662 --> 57:46.929
     -Ow. Okay
     -Oops, sorry, sorry.

57:52.503 --> 57:55.737
         Yeah, you're gonna need
         some stitches.

57:55.739 --> 57:59.541
You know what we'll do, I have a
friend, she's a medical student.
We'll go to her place.

57:59.543 --> 58:02.511
-Yeah, I don't care who does it
but you really need to...
-Alicia, she's great. She's...

58:02.513 --> 58:04.213
- Okay.

58:17.193 --> 58:18.427
<i> No, don't.</i>

58:18.429 --> 58:21.797
I feel good.
   I feel great about it too.

58:21.799 --> 58:23.499
   I'm a little hungover,
   so I'm just gonna get the...

58:23.501 --> 58:25.267
   -You're hungover? Perfect.
   -Get the shakes out.

58:25.269 --> 58:27.369
What were you doing?

58:27.371 --> 58:29.571
       Just, I don't know,
       I don't remember much.
       I was at somebody's house
       or something.

58:29.573 --> 58:32.708
But do you want me
     to walk you through it
     as I'm doing it,

58:32.710 --> 58:34.176
- or just do it?
-      -No, just do it.

58:34.178 --> 58:35.911
       Okay, it's gonna take
       a couple of deep breaths.

58:35.913 --> 58:38.347
Should we do that together?
     -Yeah, okay.

58:38.349 --> 58:39.681
Okay.

58:42.185 --> 58:44.453
- How many times  have you done this?
-   -Plenty.

58:44.455 --> 58:46.989
Plenty?
     Well, like on cadavers     or something?

58:46.991 --> 58:49.458
No, no. I got it.
   I'm just not usually
   in my bathroom.

58:49.460 --> 58:51.493
- Don't make it a thing.
- No, no. It's not a thing.

58:51.495 --> 58:54.363
This is gonna be    really easy.
    It's just your face.

58:54.365 --> 58:56.899
      What have you
      been getting up to?

58:56.901 --> 59:00.168
     -My mom was here
     until a couple of days ago.
     -Your mom?

59:01.204 --> 59:02.871
Hold still, please.

59:02.873 --> 59:06.108
Right,
     this cotton's itching
     on my face.

59:06.110 --> 59:09.578
Why did your mom come?
Are your parents still together?

59:09.580 --> 59:11.813
              No, no. Are yours?

59:11.815 --> 59:13.081
     No.

59:13.083 --> 59:17.753
         You know, it's funny.
         I actually feel like...

59:19.322 --> 59:24.426
This weird thing with my friends
when their parents
are together, like...

59:24.428 --> 59:27.296
       -You can't relate.
       -Yeah, I guess.

59:27.298 --> 59:31.800
It's almost like I feel
like they're inherently more
naive than me or something.

59:31.802 --> 59:35.237
   Not like in a judgy way,
   just like...

59:35.239 --> 59:37.673
   If it hasn't happened
   to your parents, you don't...

59:37.675 --> 59:40.709
     You don't really understand
     that it can happen to you
     or something.

59:41.010 --> 59:42.611
Mmm.

59:42.613 --> 59:44.646
Just not like
     taking it for granted.

59:44.648 --> 59:47.182
- Can you please     hold still?
-      -I'm trying.

59:47.184 --> 59:48.951
- But...
-         -Okay,        get comfortable.

59:48.953 --> 59:50.686
    It's in your fucking face
    right now, so if you want...

59:50.688 --> 59:54.923
 -I'm getting comfortable,
 but this...
 -I want a break anyway, okay.

59:54.925 --> 59:56.925
The toilet is more
uncomfortable
than that needle.

59:56.927 --> 01:00:00.529
        -Okay, okay.
        -Okay, I'm good.

01:00:00.531 --> 01:00:02.831
 -You ready to start again?
 -Yeah, I'm ready.

01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:05.067
- Okay.
-          -Okay.

01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:07.836
I'm so grateful   for this, by the way.
   Did I tell you that already?

01:00:07.838 --> 01:00:09.871
        -Yeah, you did.
        -Okay, good.

01:00:09.873 --> 01:00:11.440
               You might not be
               when you see it.

01:00:11.442 --> 01:00:13.709
    -Really? Can you please
    make it look good?
    -Please just stay still.

01:00:13.711 --> 01:00:15.243
I need one of those
sexy scars.

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:21.149
- So you have to
    come back and see me
    in seven to ten days...
    -Okay.

01:00:21.151 --> 01:00:25.020
     -...so I can take out
     the stitches.
     -Okay.

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:28.256
Lee, how are you?

01:00:28.258 --> 01:00:30.158
         Good. Hungry.

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:32.761
Hungry?

01:00:33.363 --> 01:00:34.963
      Yeah, I'm starving.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.365
- You have anything?
-    -No.

01:00:36.367 --> 01:00:38.000
We'll go get something.

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:46.742
- <i> Can't find your...</i>
-  -<i> One week.</i>

01:00:46.744 --> 01:00:49.244
   -It was nice to meet you.
   -You too.

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:50.545
Sorry I didn't have
any food.

01:00:51.715 --> 01:00:54.316
Okay.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.086
           All right.

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.227
                Fingers crossed.

01:01:46.603 --> 01:01:48.370
              Hah!

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:49.604
No, don't shoot!

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:08.724
                             No!

01:02:08.726 --> 01:02:11.727
Shit! Shit!

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:18.100
              No!

01:02:24.742 --> 01:02:26.174
How do you like
your steak?

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:28.477
                    Medium well.

01:02:28.479 --> 01:02:31.146
         Medium well.
         Medium well.

01:02:59.476 --> 01:03:01.843
So I go on
        in what turns out to be
        a bit of a boys' trip.

01:03:01.845 --> 01:03:06.114
  I was thinking
  it was the last thing I need,
  but I end up on
  this big boy's trip and...

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:09.317
Meaning that you were
going to get all drunk
and everything.

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:12.087
    -We would get all drunk
    and get into all sorts
    of trouble.
    -This is really good.

01:03:12.089 --> 01:03:14.823
            Is it?
            It's not overcooked?

01:03:14.825 --> 01:03:16.258
It's perfect.

01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:57.265
I think I have an easier time
with spiritual desire
than earthly desire.

01:03:57.267 --> 01:03:58.533
Is that possible?

01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:03.104
   -Yeah, of course.
   -That I'm more comfortable...

01:04:03.106 --> 01:04:05.407
     -With earthly desire,
     with spiritual desire--
     -No.

01:04:05.409 --> 01:04:08.276
             Yeah, of course.
             Well, you would be
             because that's what
             we aspire to.

01:04:08.278 --> 01:04:12.080
    The earthly desires lead to
    spiritual desires hopefully.

01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:14.416
    -You can start--
    -But I think I'm trying
    to bypass it.

01:04:14.418 --> 01:04:17.919
     -Do you?
     -Yeah, I think I try
     to not experience...

01:04:17.921 --> 01:04:19.754
              I think you should
              experience them.

01:04:19.756 --> 01:04:22.624
Like, I think my appetite
is so ravenous.

01:04:22.626 --> 01:04:23.758
                         Mm-hmm.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.460
         -Why?
         -I love that.

01:04:25.462 --> 01:04:31.867
Oh. I think it is that maybe
I think it might, like,
overwhelm the system.

01:04:31.869 --> 01:04:36.571
Your appetite is so ravenous.
Well, it was certainly
the way you attacked that steak.

01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:38.306
Well, it was a big steak.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:57.092
<i> Boy, she is</i>
<i>a beautiful girl.</i>

01:04:57.094 --> 01:04:59.261
<i>You gonna smack</i>
<i>that hippy ass?</i>

01:04:59.263 --> 01:05:00.829
       Hey, what are you
       doing here?

01:05:00.831 --> 01:05:03.698
Hey, dude, she's fine,
fine as wine.

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.333
               Get out of here.
               Come here.

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:06.334
        Hey, get out
        of town.

01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:09.204
- Get out of here.
-     -Hey! Get high.

01:05:09.206 --> 01:05:11.172
 -Where are you going? Come on.
 -Oh, no.

01:05:11.174 --> 01:05:13.742
   Okay, hey, I'm gonna go...
   Max, one sec, come back.

01:05:13.744 --> 01:05:15.310
I might crash out
    on that hammock.

01:05:15.312 --> 01:05:18.513
Find me      in a couple of hours.
      The hammock's perfect.

01:05:18.515 --> 01:05:20.148
- Max.
          -Yes.

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:23.285
    -Please do not tell me
    you're leaving.
    -Yeah.

01:05:23.287 --> 01:05:25.754
          This has been nice.
          We are having a blast.

01:05:25.756 --> 01:05:28.690
                Hey, Tim,
                what's going on?
                Hey! Hey!

01:05:28.692 --> 01:05:30.959
  I'll just have one beer
  and I'll get out of your hair.

01:05:30.961 --> 01:05:33.895
 -Hey, I'm gonna get
 rid of him.
 -You look great in that dress.

01:05:33.897 --> 01:05:35.530
         -What?
         -I'm gonna get
         rid of him.

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:37.132
      -It's not about him.
      -Then we can
      keep hanging.

01:05:37.134 --> 01:05:38.400
   -It's not even about him.
   -I know.

01:05:38.402 --> 01:05:40.201
<i> That felt like</i>
<i>an accusation of sorts.</i>

01:05:40.203 --> 01:05:43.738
           No, why are you here?
           Where's Tim?
           What's he doing?

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:47.175
Um... Hopefully,
he's doing our taxes.

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:51.947
I don't know what he's doing.
Probably has some guys over.

01:05:51.949 --> 01:05:54.349
Eating pizza, drinking beers.

01:05:54.351 --> 01:05:57.185
We're house-sitting in
this amazing house.
He may be swimming in the pool.

01:05:57.187 --> 01:05:59.087
<i> Well, hey,</i>
<i>if you're really gonna go,</i>

01:05:59.089 --> 01:06:01.122
do you mind if I get
the dress back?

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:02.891
                  But she looks
                  great in it.

01:06:02.893 --> 01:06:05.493
  -I know, you look beautiful,
  I just need it back.
  -Thank you.

01:06:05.495 --> 01:06:06.928
     Can I just wear it for
     one more night?

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:10.765
No, obviously, you know,
my wife will be here.

01:06:10.767 --> 01:06:12.667
That would be
tough to explain.

01:06:12.669 --> 01:06:15.603
I don't... Honestly,
I don't even wanna deal with it,
you know what I mean?

01:06:15.605 --> 01:06:17.305
              Oh, yeah.

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:20.141
<i> Like, I'm really</i>
    <i> nervous right now.</i>

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:22.811
Like, just talking
on the subject,
and I don't even know you.

01:06:22.813 --> 01:06:24.980
 -I have that effect on people.
 -And I'll never
 see you again.

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:26.414
            -Really?
            -Yeah.

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:28.616
-Oh, you're so sure?
-I've already committed to that.

01:06:28.618 --> 01:06:30.285
Ray, why did you do that?

01:06:30.287 --> 01:06:32.387
     I was just trying
     to help you out, man.
     Did I embarrass you?

01:06:32.389 --> 01:06:34.155
It's a fucking
dick move, man.

01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:36.257
Sorry, was it?
You're showing off
in front of the broad?

01:06:36.259 --> 01:06:39.361
           I wasn't showing off.
           We were having fun.
           It was kind of
           a dick move, dude.

01:06:39.363 --> 01:06:41.896
      It's, like, funny
      when Tango was here.
      It wasn't funny right now.

01:06:41.898 --> 01:06:46.868
     Sometimes you gotta know
     when to not do the fucking,
     you know, Ray Show.

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:48.636
    -That's very liberating.
    -What?

01:06:48.638 --> 01:06:50.238
    Well, we're never gonna see
    each other again.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.140
      -It is, right?
      -Yeah, I love that.

01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:54.075
                         Mm-hmm.

01:06:54.077 --> 01:06:55.610
             That I can embrace.

01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:56.778
<i> Good night.</i>

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:58.613
    Goodbye, Mrs. Ray.

01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:02.817
What's that from?

01:07:02.819 --> 01:07:06.254
            How much
            do I have to pay you
            to please leave
            my fucking house?

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:08.323
A lot of money.

01:07:08.325 --> 01:07:10.892
I love you, man.
I just wanna hang out, dude.

01:07:10.894 --> 01:07:12.727
I just wanna hang out,
come on.

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:15.030
Come on, bro.

01:07:15.032 --> 01:07:17.432
             Oh, my-fucking-God.

01:07:17.434 --> 01:07:21.436
What's wrong?
What, are you uptight?
What do you got
over there, taxes?

01:07:21.438 --> 01:07:24.105
  -You gotta decide whether--
  -Shut up, Ray!

01:07:24.107 --> 01:07:26.641
Shut up? No!
I'm not gonna shut up!

01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:29.644
You shut up!
Fuck you, man!

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:36.618
You want me outta here,
I'll get the fuck outta here.

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:37.685
                       Fuck you.

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:07.849
I think I know people
that are happy.

01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:11.719
The qualifier of insanely

01:08:11.721 --> 01:08:15.723
is the one
that's a little tricky,
you know what I mean?

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:20.662
     -Just everyday happy.
     -Hmm?

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:23.731
      Just everyday happy,
      forget the "insanely" bit.

01:08:23.733 --> 01:08:26.033
          Be consistently happy.

01:08:26.036 --> 01:08:27.368
            Mm-hmm.

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:36.377
  You've thought about it,
  undoubtedly.
  Or dealing with it, unable to.

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:40.148
              Um...

01:09:47.483 --> 01:09:49.817
Thank you
for a really good night.

01:09:50.685 --> 01:09:51.853
Sorry about your...

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:53.720
                 Thank you.

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.295
     -You wanna take this
     with you?
     -No.

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.411
              Oh!

01:12:36.885 --> 01:12:38.052
         Huh.

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:51.733
          Oh, fuck me.

01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:21.562
              Oh.

01:13:42.786 --> 01:13:46.287
           Oh, care... Care...
           The tide's coming in.

01:13:46.289 --> 01:13:47.822
            -Hey!
            -I know

01:13:47.824 --> 01:13:52.360
     Sorry. Come here.
     Do you wanna see something?

01:13:52.362 --> 01:13:55.029
    -Yeah.
    -I mean, I know
    I don't know you, but...

01:13:56.698 --> 01:13:59.467
           You gotta...
           Have you seen Saturn?

01:13:59.469 --> 01:14:03.237
    Okay, wait, wait.
    Did you ever look through...
    Just don't touch it
    because it's lined up,

01:14:03.239 --> 01:14:07.475
      and just look through the,
      just look through there
      and see what you can see.

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:10.912
                 Can you see?

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:15.883
- Oh, my God!
-        -Right?

01:14:15.885 --> 01:14:17.785
   -Yeah.
   -And you can see the rings.

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:18.986
                         I know.

01:14:20.255 --> 01:14:22.190
                Which one is it?

01:14:22.192 --> 01:14:26.294
  I know, you can't even see,
  but then you just look
  through there and there it is.

01:14:26.296 --> 01:14:28.329
    I mean, this is like...

01:14:28.331 --> 01:14:31.566
Isn't it just
           the most perfect...

01:18:16.559 --> 01:18:18.259
          I think we should get
          a telescope.

01:18:18.261 --> 01:18:19.593
Oh, that could be neat.

01:18:19.595 --> 01:18:21.295
            -Right?
            -Yeah.

01:18:24.466 --> 01:18:26.734
I might wanna try
ayahuasca together.

01:18:27.235 --> 01:18:28.836
                   Really?

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:32.039
           I think we should go
           pick up our child.

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:34.608
Me too. But can we get
breakfast first,
just the two of us?

01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:38.145
      Oh, yeah,
      let's get breakfast first.
      Let me just text my mom.

01:18:38.147 --> 01:18:40.014
       He'll be okay
       with Grandma and Pop-pop.

01:18:40.016 --> 01:18:42.883
He'll be great.
They'll spoil him.

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:45.486
Did you guys miss me at all
or did you guys
just had a blast?

01:18:45.488 --> 01:18:47.555
                   No, we did.
                   I missed you.

01:18:47.557 --> 01:18:48.856
       -I missed you too.
       -Oh, yeah.

01:18:48.858 --> 01:18:50.291
I'm not the same
without you guys.

01:18:50.293 --> 01:18:54.061
      -Yeah, me neither.
      I've discovered.
      -Good.

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:58.499
           Can we be bad parents
           and let Jude
           watch cartoons?

01:18:58.501 --> 01:19:00.501
--Climb back in bed.

01:19:00.503 --> 01:19:02.570
I think I'm gonna open
a bottle of wine
at about noon.

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:05.606
                     I love you.

01:19:05.608 --> 01:19:07.041
I love you too.
