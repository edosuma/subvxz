-[Clover] Hey, Mr. Crocodile.
-[Julien] I don't sound like that.

00:48.799 --> 00:52.636
[Clover] Glad we decided to meet at this
neutral location to sign the treaty

00:52.720 --> 00:56.515
and ensure yet another year of peace
between the lemurs and the crocodiles.

00:59.518 --> 01:00.895
King Julien! No!

01:03.605 --> 01:05.482
[Julien] I did not see that coming.

01:05.900 --> 01:06.734
[Mort] No!

01:06.901 --> 01:10.529
King Julien has been eaten!
And Maurice, too!

01:10.612 --> 01:13.615
But my tears are only for King Julien!

01:13.782 --> 01:14.950
No!

01:16.368 --> 01:17.661
I love this show!

01:17.745 --> 01:19.747
I get it. Crocodiles are dangerous.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.541
Make her stop, Maurice!
She's freaking me out!

01:22.624 --> 01:25.126
Thank you, Clover, that's enough.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.755
Don't eat me! Please! The horror.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.214
We're all gonna die!

01:29.297 --> 01:30.966
-Clover!
-Right. Sorry.

01:31.050 --> 01:33.635
I'm taking every precaution
to protect you,

01:33.719 --> 01:38.473
but just wanted to remind you these things
have not gone smoothly in the past.

01:38.557 --> 01:41.894
If they're so dangerous,
why do I have to go?

01:42.061 --> 01:43.228
[imitates beeping]

01:43.311 --> 01:45.397
News flash! I'm pretty important.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.776
Because you're the king and it's your job.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.027
Fuzzy math.

01:50.193 --> 01:53.572
Plus, if you don't go,
the crocodiles will be majorly offended.

01:53.655 --> 01:57.743
And we all know what happens
when crocodiles are offended.

01:58.326 --> 01:59.870
[imitates chomping sounds]

02:00.621 --> 02:02.039
Okay, here's the dilly.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.875
I think we should send someone else
in my place.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.544
We can't.
The crocodiles know what you look like.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.380
So just send someone who looks like me.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.966
Like, a body double?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.133
Wha-- Hoo!

02:13.216 --> 02:14.843
Yes, a body double.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.678
Sounds so naughty!

02:17.345 --> 02:19.389
That's actually a great idea!

02:19.473 --> 02:22.601
The body double could do
all the dangerous kingly duties like--

02:23.769 --> 02:25.479
Clover said duties.

02:25.604 --> 02:26.438
Oi.

02:26.521 --> 02:27.773
Body double it is.

02:27.940 --> 02:31.234
And I already have the perfect candidate!

02:34.154 --> 02:36.949
Well, I'll be! They're identical!

02:37.116 --> 02:38.826
This is Steve.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.787
Actually, I prefer to go by

02:41.870 --> 02:44.164
Magic Steve.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.917
Prepare to be amazed!

02:47.334 --> 02:49.711
Oh... Ooh...

02:49.795 --> 02:50.921
Magic.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.673
Whoa!

02:53.590 --> 02:56.259
Clover, why is "Magic Steve"

02:56.343 --> 02:58.261
pulling fruit out of my ear?

02:58.887 --> 03:01.598
Sorry, Your Majesty.
He's your new body double.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.599
Ta-da!

03:02.766 --> 03:03.767
Pfft!

03:03.851 --> 03:04.810
[laughs]

03:04.893 --> 03:08.522
Oh, Clover, if you're going to get me
a body double,

03:08.605 --> 03:11.775
at least get one that looks like me.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.485
Frankly, it's embarrassing.

03:13.568 --> 03:16.321
-[laughing]
-But he looks exactly like you.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.657
-He's perfect!
-It's uncanny!

03:18.740 --> 03:19.825
Hmm.

[sniffs]

03:24.163 --> 03:27.124
-Not seeing it.
-Magic Steve, tell King Julien

03:27.206 --> 03:30.961
-about how people think you're him.
-Oh. It's true, King Julien.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.421
I'm constantly being mistaken for you.

03:33.588 --> 03:36.842
I will now levitate this knife!

03:36.925 --> 03:38.719
With my mind!

03:41.596 --> 03:42.973
Look, it's King Julien!

03:43.640 --> 03:46.810
I'm not King Julien, all right?

03:46.894 --> 03:49.104
I'm Magic Steve!

03:49.354 --> 03:50.189
[groans]

03:50.313 --> 03:53.525
Never mind. It's not him. It's nobody!

03:53.608 --> 03:54.442
Ow!

03:54.985 --> 04:00.323
-I will now walk over these hot coals!
-King Julien, can I get your autograph?

04:00.490 --> 04:05.370
All right, I'm not King Julien.
I'm Magic Steve!

04:05.787 --> 04:06.621
[screams]

04:07.288 --> 04:09.041
Forget it. It's nobody!

04:10.291 --> 04:12.002
[Clover] I'm coming, King Julien!

04:12.086 --> 04:15.881
I'm not King Julien. I'm Magic Steve!

04:17.424 --> 04:19.342
Don't worry, I know CPR!

04:21.636 --> 04:22.721
Stay still!

04:22.888 --> 04:26.516
I'm not King Julien!
[coughs] I'm Magic Steve!

04:27.101 --> 04:29.561
I hate magic!

04:30.353 --> 04:35.692
Hmm. Your pathetic story has shown me
that there is only one lemur out there

04:35.776 --> 04:39.529
perfectly suited to double
this bodacious bod.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.742
-Why are you--
-I see you.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.619
Sage, why are you here?

04:45.702 --> 04:47.746
What color is a smile?

04:47.829 --> 04:50.040
That's not an answer-- [groans]

04:50.124 --> 04:52.251
It will be when you
ask the right question.

04:52.333 --> 04:56.255
He's here, Clover, because I have
hired Sage to be my body double.

04:56.337 --> 04:58.298
Or B-Dubs for short.

04:58.465 --> 05:01.176
King Julien,
the whole point of a body double

05:01.260 --> 05:03.053
is that people think it's you.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.513
Yeah. Sage looks exactly like me!

05:05.597 --> 05:07.557
Look at him. We're practically twins.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.603
See, he has rippling muscles,
I have rippling muscles.

05:11.686 --> 05:14.648
He has soft flowing hair,
I have soft flowing hair.

05:14.731 --> 05:18.068
He has six-pack abs, I have six-pack abs.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.904
-But--
-Let him have this.

05:20.988 --> 05:24.616
Fine. At least we're ready
for the crocodile meeting tomorrow.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.034
Not so fast, Clover!

05:26.118 --> 05:28.287
Sage might have the outer me down,

05:28.369 --> 05:31.915
but he still has a lot to learn
about the inner me.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.001
There's far too much to cover in one day.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.418
Reschedule the meeting.

05:35.585 --> 05:36.419
[both] Uh...

05:42.843 --> 05:45.428
The lemurs had to reschedule.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.430
They're not coming today.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.641
What?

05:49.724 --> 05:51.768
I've been preparing for weeks!

05:51.852 --> 05:55.063
They didn't even give us 48 hours notice!

05:55.189 --> 05:56.606
[whimpering]

06:03.738 --> 06:07.159
Can't you see I'm struggling here?
A little help would be nice!

06:09.119 --> 06:11.746
-I can't quite--
-Just go!

06:11.913 --> 06:13.332
Leave me! Go!

06:15.792 --> 06:18.128
Pretend this is you pretending to be me

06:18.212 --> 06:21.048
and not a small,
annoying lemur named Mort.

06:21.215 --> 06:24.801
You are a memory
that lives in the heel of a clown's shoe.

06:24.885 --> 06:28.055
A clown desperate to find his own circus.

06:28.222 --> 06:29.223
Exactly!

06:29.306 --> 06:33.268
As my body double,
you will be responsible for waving...

06:33.352 --> 06:34.186
Hi!

06:34.269 --> 06:36.271
-...and nodding...
-Yes. I agree.

06:36.355 --> 06:39.440
...and, of course, waving while nodding.

06:40.234 --> 06:41.068
Understood?

06:41.235 --> 06:43.362
Peacocking our karma while we wait

06:43.444 --> 06:47.657
for that beady-eyed executioner
called destiny. Understood.

06:48.909 --> 06:52.579
-How's the training going?
-I honestly have no idea.

06:53.705 --> 06:56.457
You'll also be asked
to stand around and look pretty

06:56.541 --> 07:00.545
and sometimes sign pieces of paper
to prevent wars and stuff.

07:00.712 --> 07:03.215
War is a burlesque nourished by apes.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.508
Yep. Couldn't agree more, B-Dubs.

07:05.633 --> 07:08.887
That concludes the classroom portion
of your training.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.889
I love being your puppet.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.391
That is enough, Mort!

07:13.558 --> 07:14.851
Bye!

07:15.476 --> 07:18.646
Now for your final,
and most important lesson!

07:19.189 --> 07:20.815
Repeat after me.

07:24.652 --> 07:25.653
[whooping]

07:41.420 --> 07:42.837
Okay, B-Dubs.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.298
Your turn!

07:47.550 --> 07:49.469

07:50.511 --> 07:51.471
Oh, no!

08:15.454 --> 08:19.874
How can someone so beautiful
be so bad at water-sliding?

08:19.958 --> 08:21.335
How you doing, B-Dubs?

08:21.501 --> 08:22.752
[babbling]

08:25.630 --> 08:28.716
He looks terrible, Maurice!
Is it his brain?

08:28.800 --> 08:32.095
No, his brain is fine.
Sage refused pain medication.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.474
He's gone deep in his mind
where the pain can't touch him.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.605
More tea, handsome?

08:44.441 --> 08:46.318
[screams, babbling]

08:48.195 --> 08:49.696
It'll be okay, buddy.

08:49.821 --> 08:50.822
[groans]

08:51.239 --> 08:53.241
-Sorry, bro!
-[groans]

08:53.408 --> 08:54.909
In light of Sage's injury,

08:55.076 --> 08:58.872
I've rescheduled the crocodile meeting
one last time.

09:01.624 --> 09:05.170
I'm sorry, sir,
but the lemurs have rescheduled again.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.672
Don't they know how hard I've worked?

09:08.882 --> 09:10.550
Everything's ruined!

09:10.717 --> 09:11.926
Just throw it away!

09:12.010 --> 09:14.346
-But, sir--
-Throw it away!

09:14.429 --> 09:15.638
[sobbing]

09:16.515 --> 09:20.394
And as your adviser,
I advise you not to reschedule again.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.020
Without a body double,

09:22.103 --> 09:25.357
that means I have to go
to the crocodile meeting myself!

09:25.440 --> 09:28.318
Did you not see what Clover did
to those puppets?

09:28.402 --> 09:31.530
Then I urge you to pick
a substitute body double, stat.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.865
Way I see it, there's only one choice.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.326
No, Clover.

09:36.410 --> 09:39.120
We don't even know if he can waterslide.

09:45.377 --> 09:47.295
Magic Steve!

09:50.965 --> 09:52.175
Not bad...

09:52.259 --> 09:53.427
for a nobody.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.429
Okay, fine, you're hired.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.264
And as you can see,

09:57.431 --> 10:02.185
my reign continues out over the ocean
and into space.

10:02.269 --> 10:05.688
I know I went over that quickly.
Any questions, Steve?

10:05.855 --> 10:08.358
Magic Steve.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.527
Thank you for bringing that up.

10:10.651 --> 10:14.906
Unfortunately, Magic Steve has to go.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.575
What? Why?

10:16.741 --> 10:20.287
Because it's the worst name
I've ever heard in my whole life.

10:22.747 --> 10:26.918
Even though you were my second choice,
this is a temporary position,

10:27.001 --> 10:28.836
you're still gonna need a better name.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.838
-But--
-And that name shall be...

10:30.922 --> 10:32.882
-But--
-...Soy Sauce.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.551
Soy Sauce?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.928
But I don't like that name.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.763
Trust me, it's good.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.474
Now that that's settled--

10:40.599 --> 10:43.477
Wait. I do have one question.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.936
Shoot, Soy Sauce.

10:45.103 --> 10:49.274
If I pushed you off this cliff right now,
I could go back to the kingdom,

10:49.357 --> 10:52.860
pretend to be you and nobody'd
know the difference, right?

10:53.027 --> 10:56.823
Yeah, I guess that's true.
And who could blame you, really?

10:56.990 --> 11:01.702
[laughs] I wouldn't want your job either.
I mean, magic is so la--

11:02.537 --> 11:03.622
[screaming]

11:04.539 --> 11:06.374
Magic Steve!

11:10.545 --> 11:11.379
[grunts]

11:13.047 --> 11:15.216
They've been gone for too long!

11:15.300 --> 11:16.426
Hello there.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.346
There you are, King Julien.
Where's Steve?

11:20.138 --> 11:22.849
Unfortunately, I lost Magic Steve.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.185
Which is too bad, I really liked him.

11:25.268 --> 11:26.478
He had a cool name.

11:26.645 --> 11:27.562
You lost him?

11:27.646 --> 11:31.399
Who will we send to the meeting?
That was the point of the double!

11:31.566 --> 11:34.735
Clover, you must go and find him.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.864
Don't come back till he's found,
do you hear me?

11:38.031 --> 11:40.158
Loud and clear, Your Majesty. On it!

11:41.201 --> 11:44.162
Too bad you'll never find him. [laughs]

11:44.245 --> 11:47.123
-What did you say, King Julien?
-I said...

11:47.207 --> 11:53.004
please gather all my... uh, peeps
from the kingly kingdom, Maurice.

11:53.087 --> 11:57.258
I have a... [clears throat]
super awesome announcement to make.

11:57.342 --> 11:59.760
Did King Julien just say "please"?

12:02.180 --> 12:04.683
In honor of Magic Steve,

12:04.849 --> 12:07.519
who is tragically no longer with us,

12:07.602 --> 12:10.980
I will be putting on a magic show.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.982
Ew. A magic show?

12:13.149 --> 12:16.110
Yes! Everyone will watch my magic show

12:16.194 --> 12:18.321
and you will like it!

12:18.405 --> 12:21.115
Because magic is awesome!

12:21.282 --> 12:24.911
-I don't think magic is awesome.
-Magic killed my brother.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.413
And one more thing!

12:26.496 --> 12:27.997
From this day forward,

12:28.081 --> 12:31.585
I will be known as the Magic King!

12:31.750 --> 12:32.877
Magic King?

12:32.960 --> 12:35.422
Yeah, pretty cool, right?

12:35.589 --> 12:39.133
Now, can I get a volunteer
to be my apprentice?

12:39.300 --> 12:41.302
Me, please pick me! I love magic!

12:41.469 --> 12:42.554
Yes, Mort.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.098
Come on up, buddy.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.601
I won't let you down, King Julien!

12:47.766 --> 12:49.018
It is only fitting

12:49.102 --> 12:53.356
that my new best friend, Mort,
will be my apprentice.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.399
Best friend?

12:54.566 --> 12:57.527
I bow down to you, oh, mighty Magic King!

12:59.320 --> 13:00.154
[laughs]

13:00.238 --> 13:01.948
I love this guy!

13:02.031 --> 13:03.533
Everybody be like Mort!

13:03.700 --> 13:04.701
Eh...

13:05.368 --> 13:07.746
Wait, you're not King Julien.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.872
-You're--
-Nobody? Wrong!

13:09.956 --> 13:13.418
I'm King Julien now
and nobody can stop me.

13:14.502 --> 13:18.256
And for my big trick,
I will saw Maurice in half!

13:18.339 --> 13:21.760
Prepare to be amazed!

13:21.842 --> 13:23.886
-Back in a bit!
-[cheering]

13:26.473 --> 13:28.767
-Help!
-King Julien?

13:30.977 --> 13:32.604
Help!

13:33.521 --> 13:34.731
Steve?

13:34.897 --> 13:38.735
Hello! Earth to Clover's eyeballs!
I am King Julien!

13:39.611 --> 13:41.780
Turn around and show me your butt.

13:41.946 --> 13:42.821
What? I--

13:42.905 --> 13:46.159
Oh, Clover.
We don't have time for--

13:46.326 --> 13:49.245
Yep, that's the scar.
But I don't understand.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.914
If you're here, who's back--
[gasps]

13:51.998 --> 13:53.040
Steve!

13:53.124 --> 13:54.793
What did he do?

13:54.959 --> 13:57.420
For starters, he pushed me off a cliff,

13:57.587 --> 13:58.421
and then--

13:58.546 --> 13:59.380
He what?

13:59.547 --> 14:01.840
Wait, I'm not done telling my story.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.343
[screaming]

14:06.513 --> 14:08.139
Kind of strange

14:08.264 --> 14:11.351
that there'd be a trampoline out here.

14:11.518 --> 14:16.105
No one will disturb
our trampoline dance practice out here.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.940
You ready, Dorothy?

14:23.237 --> 14:25.573
That's not important right now, Clover!

14:25.657 --> 14:27.367
Can I please finish my story?

14:34.165 --> 14:35.916
[laughs]

14:37.168 --> 14:39.379
And so I did that for about six hours

14:39.462 --> 14:42.799
until I got bored
and then I just stopped bouncing.

14:44.759 --> 14:47.595
The story's over.
You may resume your shock and awe.

14:47.679 --> 14:51.140
-Right. Permission to be outraged, sir!
-Permission granted.

14:51.307 --> 14:55.186
[yells] Wait till I get a hold
of that Magic Steve!

14:59.315 --> 15:00.817
I'm gonna do him in!

15:03.069 --> 15:05.864
I hate Magic Steve!

15:07.532 --> 15:08.742
I'm gonna do him in!

15:08.908 --> 15:10.744
Okay, let's wrap it up, Clover.

15:12.537 --> 15:13.538
I'm good.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.790
Well, not good, but--

15:15.915 --> 15:17.333
[hawk screeching]

15:18.334 --> 15:20.294
B-Dubs! Where have you been?

15:20.420 --> 15:23.923
I've been sending out
the secret body double distress signal

15:24.006 --> 15:25.007
for a while now.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.719
You have a secret distress signal?

15:27.886 --> 15:29.512
Sage and I came up with it.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.264
It's genius. Listen to this.

15:31.347 --> 15:34.100
It goes-- Wait, it goes like this.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.853
Help!

15:37.812 --> 15:39.146
Well, that's...

15:39.230 --> 15:40.064
literal.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.942
Sorry. I got lost in my calm place.

15:43.025 --> 15:43.943
Been there.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.820
Fortunately, my spirit animal...

15:45.986 --> 15:47.154
[babbles]

15:47.280 --> 15:48.489
...was able to find me.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.492
Help me, Sage Moondancer.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.160
You're my only hope!

15:53.745 --> 15:54.579
[gasps]

15:55.246 --> 15:57.123
[Sage screeching]

15:57.874 --> 16:01.711
-King Julien appeared to you in a vision?
-That's just how I roll.

16:02.962 --> 16:03.963
Hold, please.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.590
It's time for my feeding.

16:09.009 --> 16:10.553
Namaste,  old friend.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.681
My body double eats hawk vomit.
No big deal.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.099
[hawk screeches]

16:15.349 --> 16:16.684
[babbles]

16:16.810 --> 16:19.729
Says Steve is posing as King Julien.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.689
[babbles]

16:21.940 --> 16:25.652
And has taken over the kingdom
and plans to cut Maurice in half.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.237
-What?
-Mo-Mo! Hurry! We have to save him!

16:28.780 --> 16:30.281
[caws]

16:37.079 --> 16:38.205
Who wants a ride?

16:38.289 --> 16:39.582
Me! Yes, I want!

16:39.666 --> 16:40.750
Shotgun!

16:42.836 --> 16:44.086
For my first trick,

16:44.253 --> 16:47.006
I will pull a rabbit out of my hat!

16:47.173 --> 16:48.466
Ziggity bobbity boo!

16:50.343 --> 16:51.260
Ta-da!

16:53.638 --> 16:54.555
[lemur] Don't get it.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.098
Boo!

16:56.182 --> 16:58.017
Who dares boo...

16:58.142 --> 17:00.269
[coughing] the Magic King?

17:03.230 --> 17:05.566
What I meant to say was...

17:05.650 --> 17:07.026
yay!

17:07.109 --> 17:09.278
More magic!
More magic!

17:09.362 --> 17:10.864
-More magic!
-More magic!

17:11.030 --> 17:12.323
That's better.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.659
Okay, for my next trick, I will...

17:14.742 --> 17:18.997
eat this basket of deadly scorpions!

17:19.079 --> 17:19.914
[Mort shouts]

17:28.047 --> 17:29.048
Magic.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.301
[belches]

17:37.223 --> 17:40.059
Ooh-wee... Yeah.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.060
Wow.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.187
Anyone gonna eat that lobster?

17:43.897 --> 17:45.398
Stood up again?

17:47.149 --> 17:48.651
This is beyond the pale!

17:48.735 --> 17:52.697
I even made him a cake. A cake!
This ends now!

17:59.037 --> 18:00.454
[roars]

18:02.289 --> 18:03.624
[sobs]

18:06.210 --> 18:07.795
As you can see here,

18:07.962 --> 18:10.381
we have just a regular box...

18:10.548 --> 18:11.966
and here we have--

18:12.842 --> 18:14.677
So sharp.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.684
-[gasps]
-[all] Ooh... Ahh...

18:24.270 --> 18:26.397
Please, Steve. I don't want to die!

18:26.480 --> 18:30.359
For the last time, it's Magic Steve!

18:30.443 --> 18:31.277
Please--

18:33.153 --> 18:37.116
Now prepare yourself
for something you've never seen.

18:37.283 --> 18:40.327
A feat so miraculous--

18:40.453 --> 18:41.495
[grunting]

18:41.871 --> 18:43.372
[hawk screeching]

18:43.873 --> 18:44.791
[screaming]

18:47.794 --> 18:50.504
I must return to my calm place to heal.

18:50.630 --> 18:54.258
Remember, you are the fire
in the dragon's droppings.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.384
Goodbye, Clover.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.720
Hey! Sage! Wake up!

18:57.887 --> 18:59.513
This guy is an imposter.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.849
I am King Julien.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.183
Get him, Clover!

19:03.350 --> 19:05.227
Wake up! Wake up right now!

19:06.104 --> 19:08.314
-Where'd she go?
-Don't listen to him.

19:08.481 --> 19:12.318
If I weren't King Julien, could I do this?

19:12.401 --> 19:13.486
Magic.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.989
And whoosh, I'm gone!

19:16.072 --> 19:17.824
Where'd I go? Nobody knows.

19:18.741 --> 19:21.995
I don't sound like that.
And we can still see you.

19:22.078 --> 19:25.123
Seriously, Soy Sauce,
you are so terrible at magic.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.834
That's not my name!

19:28.001 --> 19:28.918
[both growling]

19:30.544 --> 19:31.754
Oh, boy!

19:32.880 --> 19:34.007
[exclaiming]

19:35.716 --> 19:37.760
Wait, who are we rooting for?

19:37.844 --> 19:40.013
No idea. I can't tell them apart.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.015
King Julien!

19:42.181 --> 19:43.182
The saw!

19:46.144 --> 19:47.145
Ta-da!

19:51.816 --> 19:53.067
Ta-da!

19:53.233 --> 19:57.321
Listen, Magic Steve,
I'm sorry I made fun of your name

19:57.488 --> 19:59.866
and your talents and also your passion.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.702
Not my fault
you can't take a little criticism.

20:02.785 --> 20:05.746
But do you have to saw Maurice in half?

20:05.913 --> 20:09.750
And you most certainly didn't have to
push me off a cliff, did you?

20:09.917 --> 20:12.045
I can do whatever I want.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.796
I am King Julien!

20:13.880 --> 20:17.591
But you look nothing like me!
And that voice is ridiculous!

20:17.758 --> 20:21.345
But you look nothing like me!
And that voice is ridiculous!

20:21.512 --> 20:22.972
-Stop that!
-Stop that!

20:23.139 --> 20:24.515
Still can't tell them apart!

20:26.308 --> 20:27.185
[gasps]

20:35.442 --> 20:36.903
Which feet are the feet?

20:39.697 --> 20:41.741
No! I can't tell! I can't tell!

20:41.824 --> 20:44.827
Everything I ever believed in is a lie!

20:44.994 --> 20:46.328
[Mort crying]

20:59.008 --> 21:00.009
[sighs]

21:01.594 --> 21:04.680
Which one of you is King Julien?

21:05.389 --> 21:07.767
Oh, no! The crocodiles!

21:07.934 --> 21:09.643
Look at his teeth!

21:09.727 --> 21:11.604
We're all gonna die!

21:13.064 --> 21:13.898
[thud]

21:15.108 --> 21:15.983
[thud]

21:23.074 --> 21:24.575
I am King Ju--

21:27.536 --> 21:28.829
Magic.

21:30.497 --> 21:31.582
Good day.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.714
Is King Julien dead?

21:42.009 --> 21:43.177
That worked out.

21:43.343 --> 21:45.345
King Julien! You're alive!

21:45.512 --> 21:48.141
-Of course I am, Clover.
-But the crocodile--

21:48.307 --> 21:50.851
I saw that the crocodile looked angry,

21:50.935 --> 21:53.938
so I let Steve do his job.
Stand in for me.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.148
I mean, duh!

21:55.231 --> 21:58.567
We all know what happens
when crocodiles are offended!

21:58.651 --> 21:59.986
Right? Right?

22:00.153 --> 22:01.862
How do we know it's really you?

22:02.029 --> 22:03.697
Turn around and show me--

22:03.781 --> 22:06.408
Can I still be your apprentice,
King Julien?

22:06.492 --> 22:10.037
Get off of me, Mort!
You annoying little barnacle!

22:10.121 --> 22:11.705
Yep, that's King Julien.

22:15.209 --> 22:17.503
Hey, Sage. What you doing?

22:17.586 --> 22:19.338
Can you hear me? Sage!

22:19.421 --> 22:21.632
Up here, buddy. I'm in the moon.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.051
Are you meditating?

22:24.135 --> 22:25.761
I'll meditate with you.

22:25.845 --> 22:29.265
Om!

22:29.807 --> 22:32.059
[grunting]

22:32.185 --> 22:35.896
[gibbering]

22:36.272 --> 22:37.898
That's how it works, right?
