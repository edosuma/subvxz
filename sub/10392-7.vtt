WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:04.504
Peru is a country that's

00:04.505 --> 00:06.206
historically driven men mad, mad

00:06.207 --> 00:10.543
for gold, for cocoa, for its
magical ancient history.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.512
Now, there's something else

00:12.513 --> 00:15.715
drawing outsiders to its
hidden mountain valleys.

00:15.716 --> 00:16.716
We love the stuff.

00:16.717 --> 00:22.755
We obsess about it, gorge
on it and felty size it.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.324
I'm talking about chocolate,

00:24.325 --> 00:27.927
once a common treat, it's now

00:27.928 --> 00:30.463
becoming as nuanced as fine wine

00:30.464 --> 00:34.000
making the pursuit of the
raw good stuff all the more

00:34.001 --> 00:34.268
difficult.

00:34.269 --> 00:37.036
Item joining that hunt in

00:37.037 --> 00:38.771
remotest Peru, but not before

00:38.772 --> 00:46.772
I've reimmersed myself in the
booming Lima food scene.

I'm in Peru with this guy, Eric.

01:44.138 --> 01:47.039
He was looking at this,
he went into the tree.

01:47.040 --> 01:47.975
That's funny.

01:47.976 --> 01:51.544
Chef of the world famous
restaurant in New York.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.346
To look at where chocolate comes

01:53.347 --> 01:58.185
from, particularly our
chocolate, the very expensive

01:58.186 --> 02:00.052
limited run designer chocolate

02:00.053 --> 02:02.255
barbs Eric got me
into last year.

02:02.256 --> 02:04.557
So that's why we're in Peru.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.859
Before we get all Indiana Jones,

02:06.860 --> 02:09.127
we're spending some time in

02:09.128 --> 02:12.632
Lima, as we like the
capital city just fine.

02:12.633 --> 02:17.170
We have both of us, from
previous trips, friends here.

02:17.171 --> 02:20.707
Lima is the cultural hub and

02:20.708 --> 02:22.575
culinary capital of a country

02:22.576 --> 02:24.477
that has exploded in the last

02:24.478 --> 02:28.381
decade with scores of world
class cooks, chefs and

02:28.382 --> 02:28.682
restaurants.

02:28.683 --> 02:30.283
It has long been considered to

02:30.284 --> 02:32.185
be one of the best food scenes

02:32.186 --> 02:34.554
in all of south America.

02:34.555 --> 02:37.123
Good.

02:37.124 --> 02:37.825
Five minutes.

02:37.826 --> 02:44.731
One of our friends here
is chef restaurateur as

02:44.732 --> 02:46.299
circumstance er, one of the best

02:46.300 --> 02:48.134
most successful chefs
in the country.

02:48.135 --> 02:51.304
His family is a beloved culinary

02:51.305 --> 02:53.240
dynasty in Peru and a small

02:53.241 --> 02:54.774
fishing village about an hour

02:54.775 --> 03:00.481
south of Lima is where
they spend their weekends.

03:08.356 --> 03:12.792
His mom is like Peru's Julia

03:12.793 --> 03:16.429
Childs and James beard
rolled into one.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.197
Thank you for having us.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.934
An icon of Peruvian astronomy.

03:21.935 --> 03:24.904
To say one is fortunate to enjoy

03:24.905 --> 03:29.041
her hospitality would
be an understatement.

03:29.042 --> 03:33.846
Warm, generous, welcoming
beyond belie belief.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.214
Too bad you have
to leave so soon.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.251
Yeah.

03:38.252 --> 03:41.921
Normally, we have lunch
late, like 5:00.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.723
Do you nap before
lunch or after?

03:43.724 --> 03:44.957
Both.

03:44.958 --> 03:48.127
Sounds like paradise.

03:48.128 --> 03:48.496
Wow.

03:48.497 --> 03:50.129
Look at this.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.631
Every weekend, Marissa opens

03:51.632 --> 03:53.266
the house to an ever changing

03:53.267 --> 03:56.436
mob of friends, visitors,
drop kins and family.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.104
This is fantastic.

03:58.105 --> 04:01.574
They do not skimp on the food.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.875
Delicious, delicious things pour

04:02.876 --> 04:05.312
out of the kitchen, a torrent, a

04:05.313 --> 04:08.581
deluge of traditional
Peruvian favorites.

04:08.582 --> 04:14.053
I do this with crab meat,
yellow potato and avocado.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.622
We love avocado.

04:15.623 --> 04:18.224
It is like a touring of crab

04:18.225 --> 04:23.863
meat, avocado and mashed
yellow potatoe potatoes.

04:23.864 --> 04:24.897
This is from the coast.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.032
Beautiful.

04:26.033 --> 04:29.936
Basically raw king fish

04:29.937 --> 04:31.838
fillets dressed with lime juice.

04:31.839 --> 04:32.440
Perfect.

04:32.441 --> 04:37.544
That's scallops cerricha.

04:37.545 --> 04:42.515
Fresh scallops and lemon
juice and garlic.

04:42.516 --> 04:46.853
Drum fish, braised with
a corn based beer.

04:46.854 --> 04:51.691
They look fantastic.

04:51.692 --> 04:52.959
This is spicy.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.494
Very spicy.

04:54.495 --> 04:57.664
And stuffed riccotti peppers

04:57.665 --> 04:59.332
filled with ground beef and

04:59.333 --> 05:02.369
raisins, served with cheese.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.436
Wow.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.271
Are we lucky or what?

05:05.272 --> 05:06.506
We are lucky.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.341
That's just the beginning.

05:08.342 --> 05:09.642
There's so much more food

05:09.643 --> 05:11.277
there's no way we can show it

05:11.278 --> 05:13.045
all much less describe it.

05:13.046 --> 05:16.850
It's incredible, overwhelming,

05:17.084 --> 05:18.751
invariably fresh and delicious

05:18.752 --> 05:22.054
and different than
what I'm used to.

05:22.055 --> 05:22.590
That's fantastic.

05:22.591 --> 05:25.024
I could get out of the
chocolate business right now,

05:25.025 --> 05:28.995
put up a pup tent on Marissa's

05:28.996 --> 05:30.563
porch and dig in
for the duration.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.699
This is living.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.101
They're so fresh.

05:35.102 --> 05:38.070
I want to be her
next door neighbor.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.039
It's so good.

05:39.040 --> 05:42.375
So as Peruvian cuisine always

05:42.376 --> 05:45.144
been this diverse and this
delicious and we're just

05:45.145 --> 05:46.679
discovering it or has it changed

05:46.680 --> 05:48.381
over the last 15 years?

05:48.382 --> 05:51.283
It's challenging any way.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.820
What you're eating now
is the traditional food.

05:53.821 --> 05:57.490
There's so many products in

05:57.491 --> 05:59.492
Peru different than the states.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.761
When you eat this food,
it's something like.

06:01.762 --> 06:06.265
Not kind of like anything.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.300
It's all year-round.

06:08.301 --> 06:09.368
It is very good.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.270
What do you do when you're

06:11.271 --> 06:13.773
homesick for Peruvian food
and you're traveling?

06:13.774 --> 06:19.412
There's really... we
take some chiles with us

06:19.413 --> 06:23.883
in the luggage.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.986
I hate to say good-bye to
this but it is what it is.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.555
Things to do and places to go.

06:28.556 --> 06:31.691
Wild and apparently extremely

06:31.692 --> 06:34.293
rare cocoa trees to visit.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.828
Incredibly rare.

06:35.829 --> 06:39.165
So happy.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.267
♪

06:41.268 --> 06:46.305
♪

06:46.306 --> 06:49.341
All I can say if people are

06:49.342 --> 06:50.243
anywhere near this nice on the

06:50.244 --> 06:58.244
rest of this trip,
it's going to be okay.

06:58.552 --> 07:06.552
Lima, city of kings, home to
a third of Peru's people.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.933
Locals escape by hanging
out at the beach.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.568
Why not, when you can maybe get

07:15.569 --> 07:17.937
a tattoo while you're at it.

07:17.938 --> 07:23.310
Is that sanitary?

07:32.185 --> 07:34.120
You've been here before.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.922
Oh, yeah, man.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.124
I take Eric's suggestion and

07:38.125 --> 07:42.194
we head over to see chef Wang,

07:42.195 --> 07:44.631
the uniquely nonconformist

07:44.632 --> 07:47.967
seafood specialist, famous
for his incredible and

07:47.968 --> 07:52.304
uncompromising food and
his flaming wok.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.875
If Peru has a national
dish, it's probably this.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.578
The fresh estfish only needs the

07:58.579 --> 08:04.818
right cut, a little
citrus and no heat.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.491
What's the most common
thing people do wrong?

08:12.492 --> 08:14.093
The quality of the ingredients.

08:14.094 --> 08:17.864
You don't do it with
something that is not fresh.

08:17.865 --> 08:20.132
The cut and the thickness.

08:20.133 --> 08:20.400
Right.

08:20.401 --> 08:24.236
When you do it, you don't
do it ahead of time.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.472
The whole place is served

08:26.473 --> 08:28.407
whatever men you he's doing that

08:28.408 --> 08:29.709
day, same for everybody.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.310
Today, the flounder he got from

08:31.311 --> 08:32.945
the market is particularly nice,

08:32.946 --> 08:35.381
so that's what we're getting.

08:35.381 --> 08:36.582
Generally thicker pieces to

08:36.583 --> 08:40.419
stand up to the
supervises and acids.

08:40.419 --> 08:43.489
Octopus and flounder.

08:43.490 --> 08:45.457
I don't know what
to tell you, man.

08:45.458 --> 08:46.193
It's damn good.

08:46.194 --> 08:49.095
It is good.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.698
Is this spicy or not?

08:51.699 --> 08:55.935
You ever been spanked in
your life and enjoyed it?

08:55.936 --> 08:56.837
Me neither.

08:56.838 --> 08:58.004
I don't like pain.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.972
As painful as the pepper.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.574
Brutalized with a pepper.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.175
That's really hot.

09:03.176 --> 09:06.178
It's flounder dressed with

09:06.179 --> 09:14.153
pecan, lime, limo and sesame
oil, clearly Eric likes.

09:14.154 --> 09:18.625
So you're not like foraging
in the Catskills for your

09:18.626 --> 09:18.926
inspiration?

09:18.927 --> 09:26.866
You basically rip your ideas
off small businessmen?

09:26.867 --> 09:34.867
It's okay?

09:35.108 --> 09:36.175
Circumstance.

09:36.176 --> 09:39.045
Superb.

09:39.046 --> 09:42.514
Chinese and Japanese immigrants
came to Peru in great

09:42.515 --> 09:45.151
numbers in the 19th and 20th

09:45.152 --> 09:46.619
centuries as contract laborers

09:46.620 --> 09:48.387
and farmers and their influence

09:48.388 --> 09:49.822
is felt here, particular there

09:49.823 --> 09:53.660
in food, to a greater degree
than anywhere else on the

09:53.661 --> 09:54.227
continent.

09:54.228 --> 09:55.762
It's that influence and the

09:55.763 --> 09:58.597
ingredients of Amazonia and

09:58.598 --> 10:00.132
Andes that really distinguishes

10:00.133 --> 10:01.768
the food here as
something special.

10:01.769 --> 10:06.405
What is this?

10:06.406 --> 10:10.877
Tofu?

10:10.878 --> 10:12.544
This is not traditional.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.013
It looks Asian to me.

10:14.014 --> 10:19.185
I believe it's probably
his name is want.

10:19.186 --> 10:23.355
Unless he's a retired porn

10:23.356 --> 10:26.926
star... this shouldn't
be good but it is.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.361
Working up a sweat on that one.

10:29.362 --> 10:32.564
Might have a couple
more beers after this.

10:32.565 --> 10:37.604
Have a nice nap, midday nap.

10:47.414 --> 10:50.950
One more day in Lima, the

10:50.951 --> 10:53.285
chance to delve a bit further

10:53.286 --> 10:54.854
into the cuisine before things

10:54.855 --> 10:57.489
get a little more old school.

10:57.490 --> 11:04.831
A special one we prefer here.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.767
Colentro?

11:07.768 --> 11:14.974
It's like cilantro and much
more powerful in flavor.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.776
It would be wrong to point

11:16.777 --> 11:21.113
out it is at the
forefront of create I

11:21.114 --> 11:22.148
creating flavor unique to the

11:22.149 --> 11:24.751
Andes and Amazon, flavors you

11:24.752 --> 11:26.719
find no place else on earth.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.154
There seems to be a lot of

11:28.155 --> 11:30.589
interest in the last decade to

11:30.590 --> 11:32.691
the Amazon because of its

11:32.692 --> 11:35.762
amazing spectra entirely new to

11:35.763 --> 11:38.130
most of us of ingredients.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.766
At the cutting edge of exactly

11:39.767 --> 11:43.569
that territory, his restaurant

11:43.570 --> 11:46.538
Amaz explores the rivers and

11:46.539 --> 11:50.142
landscape of Peru highlighting a

11:50.143 --> 11:50.911
range of products stunning in

11:50.912 --> 11:54.280
their diversity and
to us, their newness.

11:54.281 --> 12:01.921
You have tuna, plantain vinegar.

12:01.922 --> 12:06.725
The nut is a fruit in Brazil.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.360
Hmm.

12:07.361 --> 12:13.099
We make these scallops
with wild almond.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.435
It is very very soft, the
flavor of it and complements

12:16.436 --> 12:17.037
very well.

12:17.038 --> 12:23.876
This one is fresh water shrimp.

12:23.877 --> 12:26.145
Whole new flavor
spectrum, all new.

12:26.146 --> 12:29.415
Almost like you need a new
section of your tongue.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.885
It must be exciting Ba
because they're an amazing

12:32.886 --> 12:34.320
garden with the Amazon.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.354
That looks good.

12:35.355 --> 12:41.560
This is a soup made of ham
and peanuts and corn.

12:41.561 --> 12:42.694
Hmm.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.530
I like the food.

12:44.531 --> 12:48.434
I've enjoyed these
cocktails, to too.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.269
We're going to be wasted.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.470
We'll be fine.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.173
Oh, whoa.

12:54.174 --> 12:57.043
This is also tradition.

12:57.044 --> 13:00.346
They seasons the fish, put
it on a Leif and cook it.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.848
The fish is catfish.

13:01.849 --> 13:06.152
In the Amazon we have like
200 types of catfish.

13:06.153 --> 13:09.688
And the flavor from
the Leif, too.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.891
Here, we have the second

13:11.892 --> 13:13.592
biggest fresh water
fish in the world.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.095
Underneath you have a puree that

13:16.096 --> 13:24.096
is a Pam fruit and a
production of fermented yuka.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.438
Fermented.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.274
Or poisonous.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.676
And it becomes...
You can eat it.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.444
These fish are unbelievable.

deeper than a rice paddy.

13:42.022 --> 13:45.291
years Peru will be
the next big thing.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.126
It is.

13:46.127 --> 13:47.426
This really prove it.

nuts and ants.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.473
Yeah.

14:06.213 --> 14:09.415
No.

14:09.416 --> 14:10.816
Imagine, you took a lot of

14:10.817 --> 14:12.985
acid and then you ate that whole

14:12.986 --> 14:15.487
bowl of ants and you go home and

14:15.488 --> 14:17.056
you experience violent diarrhea,

14:17.057 --> 14:19.525
you're tripping, it's like 4:00

14:19.526 --> 14:20.927
in the morning and you turn

14:20.928 --> 14:22.028
around and look at the toilet

14:22.029 --> 14:24.897
and all these ant heads
floating around in there.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.466
It would be cool.

14:27.467 --> 14:30.336
It would be cooler
only I can't wait.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.740
the we already knew, that Peru's

14:34.741 --> 14:37.509
food is unequivocally awesome,

14:37.510 --> 14:39.645
it seems proper we take a trip

14:39.646 --> 14:41.647
back in time to meet the

14:41.648 --> 14:46.618
forebearer's of this country's
rich cultural legacy.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.655
The museum in Lima has a massive

14:49.656 --> 14:53.725
collection of
pre-Colombian artifacts.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.627
Looking at them, you get an idea

14:55.628 --> 14:58.030
of what these ancient peoples

14:58.031 --> 15:04.136
were like, how they lived.

15:04.137 --> 15:04.871
Wow!

15:16.816 --> 15:18.550
freaked-out when they came here,

15:18.551 --> 15:21.120

call greed heads.

History does not have
to be boring.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.058
It can be sexy.

Wow, they're doing
it under a blanket.

18:22.068 --> 18:28.140

for skewered meat.

popular with the Spanish
conquistadors as today.

How is it made?

20:28.395 --> 20:30.896
Where does it come from?

20:30.897 --> 20:32.431
Columbus was the first European

20:32.432 --> 20:37.569
to encounter cocoa beans
off the coast of Honduras.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.371
He's said to have grabbed both

20:39.372 --> 20:41.673
crew and cargo and brought
them back to Spain.

20:41.674 --> 20:49.674
A few decades later a Spanish

20:53.720 --> 20:55.921
conquistador was said to have

20:55.922 --> 20:58.324
found the drink of the gods and

20:58.325 --> 20:59.791
the European royalty did their

becoming a craze for hot

21:03.396 --> 21:04.396

21:04.397 --> 21:07.399

its way to America.

26:33.993 --> 26:34.827
Yes.

26:34.827 --> 26:35.127
Absolutely.

26:35.128 --> 26:37.495
Where it comes from,
what's involved.

26:37.496 --> 26:42.167
After Eric ate some of Chris's

26:42.168 --> 26:44.569
chocolate and heard about these

26:44.570 --> 26:46.571
wild trees he was sourcing in

26:46.572 --> 26:47.839
Peru and got me involved.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.508
I'm a rather famous guy and I

26:50.509 --> 26:53.078
never cared about desserts.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.046
You on the other hand,
eat chocolate everyday?

26:55.047 --> 26:55.748
Everyday.

26:55.749 --> 26:58.416
So here we are, three men
and a chocolate bar.

26:58.417 --> 27:02.788
Good thing for the world or

27:02.789 --> 27:04.856
exploitive opportunism,
yet to be determined.

27:04.857 --> 27:11.529
What do I, after all,
know about chocolate.

27:11.530 --> 27:12.965
Next, the nut.

27:29.682 --> 27:32.984
The canyon where we're
headed to meet some of the

27:32.985 --> 27:34.419
farmers that supply the beans

27:34.420 --> 27:36.187
that make our chocolate and get

27:36.188 --> 27:44.188
me an education in
all things cacao.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.998
It can be tricky so we have to

27:46.999 --> 27:49.567
take care of the vigilante dudes

27:49.568 --> 27:51.937
that run a roadblock
outside of town.

27:51.938 --> 27:55.640
It looks like a shakedown but
they're a welcome sight.

27:55.641 --> 27:59.410
This hill, where cars have to

27:59.411 --> 28:02.280
slow down, was where all sorts

28:02.281 --> 28:04.783
used to waylay
travelers like us.

28:04.784 --> 28:07.285
So these guys stepped in
to take care of business.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.520
Wow, that was a big shotgun.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.990
That will shoot through
an engine block.

28:11.991 --> 28:18.329
Actually, I don't really
know but I'm assuming.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.165
At this time of year, there's

28:20.166 --> 28:23.034
also the rain and mud, which can

28:23.035 --> 28:24.602
mean flooded streets and streams

28:24.603 --> 28:31.442
that cut right across the roads.

28:31.443 --> 28:35.613
And there's this, the river.

28:35.614 --> 28:38.049
In the best of circumstances, a

28:38.050 --> 28:40.051
fairly adventurous way to get

28:40.052 --> 28:44.522
your vehicles across, a long
line across a fast moving

28:44.523 --> 28:47.592
current, ferry propelled
only by the flow of water.

28:47.593 --> 28:49.194
But today, the river is too high

28:49.195 --> 28:52.163
and the current too fast.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.965
River running a little high.

28:53.966 --> 28:57.368
It's these smaller
boats or nothing.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.104
When dealing with complex

28:59.105 --> 29:00.571
transportation issues, the best

29:00.572 --> 29:03.008
thing to do is pull up with a

29:03.009 --> 29:05.043
cold beer and let somebody
else figure it out.

29:05.044 --> 29:05.611
Yeah.

29:05.612 --> 29:06.978
Let's go in the boat.

29:06.979 --> 29:09.180
To my crew, I say good luck.

29:09.181 --> 29:11.016
We're headed for what looks like

29:11.017 --> 29:13.118
bar on the other side.

29:13.119 --> 29:19.124
Let me tell you,
it's quite a ride.

29:19.125 --> 29:22.361
I'll go the last.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.273
Water inside the boat.

29:35.274 --> 29:43.274
The boat is sinking.

29:46.718 --> 29:51.356
You got to go down and
then up, just right!

29:51.357 --> 29:58.830
If we make it to the other
side, reasonably dry.

29:58.831 --> 30:06.831
Beer?

30:07.639 --> 30:09.674
The canyon is home to a wide

30:09.675 --> 30:16.014
range of species including
and strange us to the cacao

30:16.015 --> 30:19.817
previously thought to
be almost extinct.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.653
A few years ago the trees were

30:22.654 --> 30:28.693
tested at a DNA lab and had the

30:28.694 --> 30:35.700
rare estforms of cacao in
the world, this stuff.

30:35.701 --> 30:39.537
Don is our cacao connection, a

30:39.538 --> 30:41.306
farmer whose family has been

30:41.307 --> 30:44.175
working these mountains
over 40 years.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.277
They're absolutely beautiful
when they start out.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.579
Really cookie looking pods

30:48.580 --> 30:49.680
when they come off the tree.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.649
They sort of look like someone

30:51.650 --> 30:53.751
glued them to the
side of a tree.

30:53.752 --> 30:55.586
This is a once a year crop?

30:55.587 --> 31:00.458
It grows continuously but
this is a peak seasons.

31:00.459 --> 31:01.260
Try that.

31:01.261 --> 31:02.961
Put one in your mouth.

31:02.962 --> 31:09.734
Bite it and see the nibs inside?

31:09.735 --> 31:11.836
Where does chocolate come from?

31:11.837 --> 31:14.139
The bean.

31:14.140 --> 31:14.673
Okay.

31:14.674 --> 31:16.041
Here's where chocolate
comes from.

31:16.042 --> 31:18.643
The trees produce pods.

31:18.644 --> 31:21.812
You split open the pods
and take out the beans.

31:21.813 --> 31:25.350
The buyer sun drys the
beans, then roasts them.

31:25.351 --> 31:27.452
After roasting, the beans are

31:27.453 --> 31:28.987
extracted from their shells and

31:28.988 --> 31:31.856
ground up, producing
chocolate liqueur.

31:31.857 --> 31:34.492
Mix this concentrate with milk,

31:34.493 --> 31:36.061
sugar, cocoa butter and you get

31:36.062 --> 31:40.999
what we call
commercial chocolate.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.101
Our chocolate bar sells for a

31:43.102 --> 31:45.971
nosebleed price that's high
by even premium chocolate

31:45.972 --> 31:46.238
standards.

31:46.239 --> 31:48.439
Where does the money go?

31:48.440 --> 31:50.775
Most importantly to me and Eric,

31:50.776 --> 31:53.911
are we doing a good thing?

31:53.912 --> 31:55.480
Here's how it breaks down.

31:55.481 --> 32:02.353
The raw cacao costs one chunk.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.255
Lei Bo labor, the inner
sleeve, this much.

32:04.256 --> 32:08.359
Design, box,
packaging, this much.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.796
Various equipment and
miscellaneous, another small

32:11.797 --> 32:12.231
chunk.

32:12.232 --> 32:15.600
Chris, me and Eric get a
slice out of every bar.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.436
That leaves this much,
which the retailer takes.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.705
Chef bleeding heart hippie here

32:20.706 --> 32:22.907
has already convinced me to give

32:22.908 --> 32:24.575
whatever meager profits we make

32:24.576 --> 32:27.378
off our first bar
to a local charity.

32:27.379 --> 32:30.615
What's unusual about these pods?

32:30.616 --> 32:31.716
These beans?

32:31.717 --> 32:34.852
Extremely high quality flavor.

32:34.853 --> 32:36.187

32:41.093 --> 32:44.062
The chocolate here is once
in a life (..) find.

32:44.063 --> 32:46.931
About 40% of the beans from

32:46.932 --> 32:50.268
these trees have white
cacao beans mixed in.

32:50.269 --> 32:52.970
The rest are purplish in color.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.173
We heard of an ultra rare group

32:55.174 --> 33:00.711
of trees further up the
mountains that produce pods of

33:00.712 --> 33:02.613
100% all white pure beans

33:02.614 --> 33:04.582
something me and Eric are very

33:04.583 --> 33:05.750
interested in down the road.

33:05.751 --> 33:09.420
But for now, Don for fun Naoto's

33:09.421 --> 33:12.190
daughter has prepared us a

33:12.191 --> 33:14.692
traditional Peruvian
mountain meal.

33:14.693 --> 33:15.027
Wow.

33:15.028 --> 33:22.767
Kuinas.

33:22.768 --> 33:26.337
It's rice dumplings with
boiled chicken inside.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.206
This is amazing.

33:28.207 --> 33:31.976
Not surprisingly some Guinea

33:33.779 --> 33:35.280
many around for the taking.

33:35.281 --> 33:38.983
This preparation served
with a cacao sauce.

33:38.984 --> 33:40.017
That's good.

33:40.018 --> 33:45.256
All of this food is delicious.

33:45.257 --> 33:49.394
So chocolate, say it
is a luxury food item.

33:49.395 --> 33:49.628
Yes.

33:49.629 --> 33:52.363
This is an area abundant with

34:01.039 --> 34:03.074
years ago, it was
easier for him.

34:03.075 --> 34:05.876
He was planting
soybeans and coffee.

34:05.877 --> 34:06.578
Right.

34:06.579 --> 34:08.913
He was making much more money.

34:08.914 --> 34:13.016
And then he didn't plant
soybeans any longer and the

34:13.018 --> 34:14.652
coffee production went down so

34:14.652 --> 34:15.985
therefore he had a financial

34:15.987 --> 34:17.188
struggle for a while and now

throw in with stew.

Now we have to maked the
mashed potato and we're good.

39:31.403 --> 39:35.139
Eric's mashed potato
secret, around 50% butter.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.306
The glory that is France.

39:36.307 --> 39:38.809
I think they call it gout.

39:38.810 --> 39:39.010
Okay.

39:39.011 --> 39:45.316
Let's do it.

39:51.690 --> 39:52.957
Gracias.

39:52.958 --> 39:54.725
You guys can cook.

39:54.726 --> 39:57.662
Some say.

39:57.663 --> 40:03.701
[ Speaking foreign language ]

40:03.702 --> 40:05.836
The only guy, he asked all

40:05.837 --> 40:07.237
the founders of the village here

40:07.238 --> 40:09.339
to do exactly what he has done,

40:09.340 --> 40:11.609
so the farmers are
starting to copy him.

40:11.610 --> 40:12.043
Right.

40:12.044 --> 40:14.812
And he's happy because it's

40:14.813 --> 40:18.182
going to bring wealth, in the

40:18.183 --> 40:20.885
legend, in the valley
and the community.

40:20.886 --> 40:26.491
After Don makes a traditional
unsweetened hot chocolate

40:26.492 --> 40:32.329
preparation, ground cakau
anybodies, no sweetener, no

40:32.330 --> 40:36.300
nothing, just like the
ancient kings liked it.

40:36.301 --> 40:38.536
There we go.

40:38.537 --> 40:38.770
Gracias.

40:38.770 --> 40:39.304
The real deal.

40:39.305 --> 40:42.272
Only water, and they will use...

40:42.273 --> 40:44.975
Before chocolate hit Europe.

40:44.976 --> 40:48.513
This is what the Aztec
kings would drink.

40:48.514 --> 40:50.247
They would be jealous right now.

40:50.248 --> 40:53.250
You'll get yours eventually.

40:53.251 --> 40:54.585
Gracias.

40:54.586 --> 40:56.554
Mucho gracias.

40:56.555 --> 40:56.788
Salud.

40:56.789 --> 40:58.489
That's good salud.

40:58.490 --> 41:00.625
Salud.

41:00.626 --> 41:04.328
Gentlemen, to education.

41:04.329 --> 41:06.664
Yes.

41:06.665 --> 41:10.668
So, did we do the right thing?

41:10.669 --> 41:12.169
Is it all right for two new

41:12.170 --> 41:15.840
yorkers to make money, however

41:15.841 --> 41:17.307
much, or however little, off the

41:17.308 --> 41:21.145
work of struggling farmers
in a faraway Lane?

41:21.146 --> 41:23.614
For the nada, Alberto, Chris,

41:23.615 --> 41:24.749
everybody down the line, all the

41:24.750 --> 41:26.383
way to the families who pick the

41:26.384 --> 41:28.719
pods off the trees, seem pretty

41:28.720 --> 41:30.220
happy to be doing what they are

41:30.221 --> 41:33.658
doing, but do I want to be
in the chocolate business?

41:33.659 --> 41:36.727
That's something I'm going
to have to figure out.

41:36.728 --> 41:39.229
But for now one last thing needs

41:39.230 --> 41:44.101
to be done to fulfill our
shamanic obligations.

41:44.102 --> 41:45.369
Guys, you need to get out.

41:45.370 --> 41:48.138
The guy is coming with his
bike, and he doesn't care.

41:48.139 --> 41:49.473
A San Mateo-Hayward bridge, a

41:49.474 --> 41:51.676
bundle of uke luptus leaves, a

41:51.677 --> 41:59.677
badly working lighter,
got to get right.

42:02.621 --> 42:03.988
Do you have a lighter?

42:03.989 --> 42:07.124
We need to burn this stuff

42:07.125 --> 42:11.028
and pass it around our
bodies three times.

42:11.029 --> 42:11.997
Got something.

42:11.998 --> 42:12.998
Oh, too moist.

42:12.999 --> 42:17.001
Oh, you got it, man.

42:17.002 --> 42:17.803
Okay.

42:17.804 --> 42:19.503
Smoking.

42:19.504 --> 42:20.271
That's smoking.

42:20.272 --> 42:24.041
I'm going to get it.

42:24.042 --> 42:31.248
Hold on.

42:31.249 --> 42:32.883
Now I've got it.

42:32.884 --> 42:33.251
Let's do it.

42:33.252 --> 42:38.589
Okay.

42:38.590 --> 42:39.424
That's coming.

42:39.425 --> 42:40.625
I got it.

42:40.626 --> 42:43.060
We did it.

42:43.061 --> 42:43.962
Over.

42:43.963 --> 42:47.331
Okay.

42:47.332 --> 42:48.899
Done.

42:48.900 --> 42:49.200
Hey.

42:49.201 --> 42:50.636
We have a problem with chocolate

42:51.202 --> 42:52.203
I'll tell you that.
