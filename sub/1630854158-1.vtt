00:25.251 --> 00:27.526
So, all in favor
of the city of Springfield

00:27.528 --> 00:29.844
no longer celebrating
Columbus Day

00:29.846 --> 00:33.106
due to the problematic behavior
of Christopher Columbus?

00:33.108 --> 00:34.107
MAJORITY: Aye.

00:34.109 --> 00:36.443
-All opposed?
-(exclaiming)

00:36.445 --> 00:39.613
Now I'll hand it over to
the terrifyingly engaged citizen

00:39.615 --> 00:43.024
who has had her hand up
since before the meeting began,

00:43.026 --> 00:44.859
Helen Lovejoy.

00:44.861 --> 00:46.545
(audience grumbles)

00:46.547 --> 00:49.030
I've noticed lately that people
have been putting up

00:49.032 --> 00:51.717
quite a few little DIY
free libraries

00:51.719 --> 00:52.885
all over town.

00:52.887 --> 00:55.537
What's DIY stand for?

00:55.539 --> 00:56.722
Do it yourself.

00:56.724 --> 00:59.058
I'm trying to but I can't.

00:59.060 --> 01:02.286
Just this past week,
six new ones popped up.

01:02.288 --> 01:04.045
-(murmuring)
-Hallelujah!

01:04.047 --> 01:05.597
Think about the consequences,
people.

01:05.599 --> 01:06.899
Free books?

01:06.901 --> 01:08.625
What if one of them
is the<i> Kama Sutra?</i>

01:08.627 --> 01:11.236
That's just bait
for learned perverts.

01:11.238 --> 01:14.889
There is no classical art
without<i> the erotic.</i>

01:14.891 --> 01:17.058
-Ew.
-You and me
got to hang sometime.

01:17.060 --> 01:19.060
I like those little libraries.

01:19.062 --> 01:20.487
Unlike the public school
library,

01:20.489 --> 01:23.156
these have books
written after 1945.

01:23.158 --> 01:24.732
The children think Iceland
is still a kingdom.

01:24.734 --> 01:27.661
Oh, these abominations
don't follow the rules

01:27.663 --> 01:29.404
of my neighborhood association.

01:29.406 --> 01:32.574
What if someone paints it
an unauthorized shade of white?

01:32.576 --> 01:34.576
Like Swiss coffee.

01:34.578 --> 01:36.320
(indistinct chatter)

01:36.322 --> 01:38.454
Homer Simpson here.

01:38.456 --> 01:41.658
Today I'm standing, even
in the presence of a chair,

01:41.660 --> 01:43.493
to say what if we took

01:43.495 --> 01:45.270
all the little free book huts

01:45.272 --> 01:48.089
and moved them
into one big building

01:48.091 --> 01:50.192
open to everybody?

01:51.170 --> 01:53.928
Do you mean like... a library?

01:53.930 --> 01:57.174
-(Homer whimpers)

01:57.176 --> 02:00.177

-Nothing upstairs.

-Aw, what a dummy.
<i> -Idiota.</i>

I... Well, uh...

02:08.278 --> 02:10.963
Sorry, reflections can't talk.
Got to go.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.175
<i> (Homer moans)</i>

02:15.177 --> 02:18.362
You guys say ideas
all the time.

02:18.364 --> 02:20.881
The one time I say one
they shoot me down,

02:20.883 --> 02:23.124
just like they shot down
the<i> Titanic.</i>

02:23.126 --> 02:25.535
Actually, the<i> Titanic...</i>

02:25.537 --> 02:27.312
Face it, Marge,

02:27.314 --> 02:29.206
you're married to a dummy.

02:29.208 --> 02:32.876
-No, a dum-dum.
-(gasps)

02:32.878 --> 02:36.713
Oh, this big, beautiful head
is full of great ideas

02:36.715 --> 02:38.715
just waiting to be set free.

02:38.717 --> 02:40.901
I might be okay
if you do that

02:40.903 --> 02:42.644
for the rest of my life.

02:42.646 --> 02:45.664
I know just the place that will
make you feel better.

02:48.227 --> 02:49.668
Did you see how
the credit card thing

02:49.670 --> 02:52.396
at the ticket booth
told me to remove my card,

02:52.398 --> 02:53.672
like I didn't know
how to do it?

02:53.674 --> 02:57.676
Then it got stuck 'cause
I didn't know how to do it.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.252
Let's just go home.

02:59.254 --> 03:01.996
We haven't even
seen any animals yet.

03:01.998 --> 03:05.075
So? Even the animals
will think I'm dumb.

03:05.077 --> 03:07.019
Oh, don't be silly.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.520
(cackling)

03:08.522 --> 03:11.598
That's just the sound
hyenas make.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.266
(laughing)

03:13.268 --> 03:14.443
(moans)

03:15.863 --> 03:17.196
Slow Leonard?

03:17.198 --> 03:19.423
I've always loved
that tortoise.

03:19.425 --> 03:22.609
I can't believe
Leonard is still alive.

03:22.611 --> 03:24.369
The mighty tortoise.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.447
Dumber than me.
Loser to the hare.

03:27.449 --> 03:30.209
The tortoise famously
wins that race.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.694
Really?
I only read the beginning

03:32.696 --> 03:34.362
of that story really fast.

03:34.364 --> 03:36.289
Then I got tired
and took a nap.

03:36.291 --> 03:38.175
I don't see any tortoise.

03:40.446 --> 03:43.889
Excuse me, do you know
what happened to Leonard?

03:43.891 --> 03:46.283
Leonard? Huh.
I don't see him.

03:46.285 --> 03:48.727
That's weird. Well,
the thing about a tortoise is

03:48.729 --> 03:50.062
they're always somewhere.

03:50.064 --> 03:52.731
He must have gotten out.
Who's in charge here?

03:52.733 --> 03:55.158
I am the director of the zoo.

03:55.160 --> 03:56.309
Would you like a koala sticker?

03:56.311 --> 03:59.887
Yes, I would.
Slow Leonard is missing.

03:59.889 --> 04:01.982
Now, let's not panic, sir.

04:01.984 --> 04:03.967
I don't see him either,
but I'm sure

04:03.969 --> 04:05.485
there's some explanation.

04:05.487 --> 04:06.486
We'll look into it.

04:06.488 --> 04:07.562
Look into it?

04:07.564 --> 04:10.249
I know when I'm being
talked down to.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.567
-You think I'm dumb,
don't you?
-No,

04:12.569 --> 04:15.495
I don't, but do you
have a degree in zoology?

04:15.497 --> 04:19.073
No, but I've seen
the comedy classic<i> Zookeeper</i>

04:19.075 --> 04:21.075
-19 times.
-I love that movie.

04:21.077 --> 04:22.928
I don't need your approval,

04:22.930 --> 04:25.155
and neither does
Sylvester Stallone,

04:25.157 --> 04:29.101
as the voice of Joe,
the African lion.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.936
A tortoise is missing,

04:30.938 --> 04:32.938
and this dumb guy

04:32.940 --> 04:35.923
is gonna find him.

04:35.925 --> 04:38.026
(grunts)

04:40.339 --> 04:43.448
There we go.
A recent picture.

04:45.027 --> 04:47.027
Mom, it's late, I'm worried.

04:47.029 --> 04:49.529
Why isn't Dad at Moe's?
Is Moe all right?

04:49.531 --> 04:52.365
He's fine. Your dad's
been looking for clues

04:52.367 --> 04:54.534
in those zoo pictures
all night.

04:54.536 --> 04:58.780
Come on, buddy, you're
smart enough to crack this.

04:58.782 --> 05:00.448
(gasps)
Dolly tire tracks.

05:00.450 --> 05:03.168
I bet someone used a dolly
to cart Leonard off.

05:03.170 --> 05:06.454
And those treads are clearly
from a Haul-Pro convertible

05:06.456 --> 05:09.199
with a weight cap
of 500 pounds.

05:09.201 --> 05:11.885
Wow, Dad, how did you
figure that out?

05:11.887 --> 05:14.037
Eh, yep, well,
your dad knows

05:14.039 --> 05:16.982
a thing or two about dollies.

05:16.984 --> 05:20.027
Drive safe, ya bum.

05:21.213 --> 05:22.729
I think you'll find
these photos

05:22.731 --> 05:26.825
more than enough proof to open
a missing turtle investigation.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.309
Wow, Homer, you're right.

05:28.311 --> 05:30.829
These photos are
incredible evidence.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.390
-Really?
-Evidence of how dumb you are.

05:33.392 --> 05:35.667
I just love it when
regular people think

05:35.669 --> 05:37.318
they can solve crimes.

05:37.320 --> 05:40.113
It's like a dog thinking
he can mow the lawn.

05:40.115 --> 05:42.065
(laughing)

05:42.067 --> 05:43.825
-Aw.
-Look at...

05:43.827 --> 05:45.177
Hey.

05:46.254 --> 05:48.738
No one takes me seriously.

05:48.740 --> 05:51.424
You know, there's a lot
of specific interest groups

05:51.426 --> 05:52.425
on Facelook.

05:52.427 --> 05:54.260
I'm in one about
knitting mug cozies

05:54.262 --> 05:57.004
with a little window so you can
read the funny message

05:57.006 --> 05:58.190
on the mug.
(chuckles)

05:58.192 --> 06:00.750
Why don't you check
to see if there's a group

06:00.752 --> 06:02.102
about Leonard's case?

06:02.104 --> 06:05.864
Social media?
Is that website still on?

06:05.866 --> 06:08.700
Hey, there is a missing
tortoise group here.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.185
(gasps)
It's called Lost Leonard!

06:11.187 --> 06:13.430
But what if they say
I'm stupid

06:13.432 --> 06:15.098
or drag me in the comments?

06:15.100 --> 06:17.209
Do you know how scary it is
in this climate

06:17.211 --> 06:18.693
to be a dumb white man?

06:18.695 --> 06:20.286
You care about that turtle.

06:20.288 --> 06:22.547
I think you'll feel better
if you try.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.233
(sighs)
The police don't believe me,

06:25.235 --> 06:28.035
but I'm posting some photos
that I think prove

06:28.037 --> 06:31.098
that Slow Leonard
has been kidnapped.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.133
(whimpers)

06:33.135 --> 06:35.394
(computer chiming)

06:35.396 --> 06:37.804
Dad, they're agreeing
with you.

06:37.806 --> 06:39.731
They think Leonard
was stolen, too.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.233
Really? Oh, my God.

06:41.235 --> 06:43.050
A group of anonymous
cyber sleuths

06:43.052 --> 06:44.552
don't think I'm an idiot.

06:44.554 --> 06:46.146
They like what I said.

06:46.148 --> 06:49.966
(giggles)
That tickles.

06:49.968 --> 06:51.660
The Internet thinks I'm smart.

06:56.566 --> 06:58.917
Okay, this is Homer S.
live streaming

06:58.919 --> 07:00.477
to the Lost Leonard
Facelook group

07:00.479 --> 07:03.296
from the scene of the crime.
Are we all on?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.652
How convenient.

07:08.654 --> 07:10.762
They're replacing Leonard
with a much more

07:10.764 --> 07:12.264
Instagrammable animal.

07:12.266 --> 07:15.008
One that can fit
into baby clothes.

07:15.010 --> 07:17.827
Maybe we have our motive.

07:17.829 --> 07:19.921
-Of course.
-Brilliant.

07:19.923 --> 07:22.607
Thanks, guys.
I do what I can,

07:22.609 --> 07:24.184
which is a lot.

07:24.186 --> 07:26.260
Look at this, dream team.

07:26.262 --> 07:29.522
A video doorbell
across the street from the zoo.

07:29.524 --> 07:31.432
How convenient.

07:31.434 --> 07:34.161
Oh. It's actually
very convenient.

07:35.864 --> 07:37.772
Simpson, what can
I do for you?

07:37.774 --> 07:40.441
For us. I don't know if you've
heard the terrible news

07:40.443 --> 07:42.702
that Slow Leonard
has been kidnapped.

07:42.704 --> 07:44.354
What?! Not Leonard.

07:44.356 --> 07:46.614
Why couldn't they have taken
one of those damn

07:46.616 --> 07:48.541
barking seals instead?

07:48.543 --> 07:50.302
(seals barking)

07:50.304 --> 07:52.378
When do you monsters sleep?!

07:52.380 --> 07:54.956
I'm a member of a team
of cyber sleuths

07:54.958 --> 07:56.049
searching for Leonard.

07:56.051 --> 07:58.125
Can we look at your
door camera footage?

07:58.127 --> 07:59.886
Oh, of course. And, um,

07:59.888 --> 08:01.371
I'd love to join the group.

08:01.373 --> 08:03.798
But, uh, you guys
probably already have,

08:03.800 --> 08:05.650
uh, a superintendent.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.970
-We do now.
-(chuckles)

08:08.972 --> 08:10.822
<i> HOMER:</i>
<i> Marge. Marge.</i>

08:10.824 --> 08:13.992
Marge, fan out those
cocktail napkins.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.495
Or did you not watch
the TikTok I sent you?

08:16.497 --> 08:18.312
Calm down.

08:18.314 --> 08:19.906
I've never seen you
this excited

08:19.908 --> 08:21.166
for a meet and greet.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.835
Yeah, so who's coming
to this thing again?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.228
Internet randos?

08:25.230 --> 08:26.988
Let me tell you something, son.

08:26.990 --> 08:30.066
Every human being
is born an Internet rando.

08:30.068 --> 08:31.510
And then they stay
Internet randos

08:31.512 --> 08:33.494
until they connect
over a cause.

08:33.496 --> 08:35.538
And then and only then
do they achieve

08:35.540 --> 08:39.834
their full potential
and become not random.

08:39.836 --> 08:41.853
Dad, is that really...

08:41.855 --> 08:43.596
Duh, yes. Paella.

08:43.598 --> 08:46.340
What do you think all this
toasted saffron is for?

08:46.342 --> 08:48.026
You've never
toasted us anything.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.419
Not even toast.

08:49.421 --> 08:51.363
I don't need to show off
for you, Marge.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.180
You already bought the cow.

08:53.182 --> 08:55.775
I finally have a group
of friends who think I'm smart.

08:55.777 --> 08:57.702
Who haven't used
a skeptical emoji

08:57.704 --> 09:00.038
with a monocle
even once with me.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.097
(doorbell rings)

09:01.099 --> 09:02.098
(gasps)
They're here.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.858
Keep stirring gently, slow.

09:03.860 --> 09:06.461
-Like stirring a baby.
-(grumbles)

09:07.289 --> 09:08.696
Thanks for hosting, Homer.

09:08.698 --> 09:11.032
I would have,
but my infinity pool broke.

09:11.034 --> 09:12.625
Its edge is now finite.

09:12.627 --> 09:15.554
I'm up to my eyeballs
in contractors and physicists.

09:15.556 --> 09:19.540
Come in. Oh, you all look
so much like your avatars.

09:19.542 --> 09:22.394
I got paella, of course,
a big-screen TV

09:22.396 --> 09:24.045
for viewing
surveillance footage,

09:24.047 --> 09:25.455
an evidence board

09:25.457 --> 09:27.065
and, of course,
yarn for connecting

09:27.067 --> 09:29.642
our seemingly unrelated photos.

09:29.644 --> 09:32.887
Um, is this genuine
Mrs. McClellan's Evidence Yarn?

09:32.889 --> 09:34.147
<i> Fancy.</i>

09:34.149 --> 09:36.557
Why, yes, it is.
Illuminati strength.

09:36.559 --> 09:40.078
Nine out of ten scientists
are afraid of it.

09:41.748 --> 09:45.491
I'd like to thank Homer
for this extraordinary paella.

09:45.493 --> 09:49.979
My mouth would swear
it is in Barcelona.

09:49.981 --> 09:51.831
(indistinct conversations)

09:51.833 --> 09:53.592
♪

09:58.323 --> 10:00.824
Hey, uh, uh,
not to go down a rabbit hole,

10:00.826 --> 10:02.583
but this plot could go deep,

10:02.585 --> 10:05.161
and the one person
we haven't looked at yet

10:05.163 --> 10:07.163
is the zoo director.

10:07.165 --> 10:09.499
(scoffs)
The zoo director. Um, Gil,

10:09.501 --> 10:12.335
-isn't that a little desperate?
-Hold it.

10:12.337 --> 10:15.262
There's one thing you need to
know about this paella party.

10:15.264 --> 10:17.431
There are no bad ideas.

10:17.433 --> 10:19.676
Nothing said here is stupid.

10:19.678 --> 10:20.693
BOTH:
Mm-hmm.

10:20.695 --> 10:22.679
-Mm...
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

10:22.681 --> 10:24.271
Oh, then I want to say
I agree with Gil

10:24.273 --> 10:27.533
about the zoo director.
We should board it.

10:27.535 --> 10:30.353
Has anybody dug through
the tortoise scat yet?

10:30.355 --> 10:33.131
Maybe he was being used
as a drug mule.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.524
Board it.

10:34.526 --> 10:38.044
Perhaps Leonard's seed
was required by scientists

10:38.046 --> 10:40.121
who want to breed
slower horses.

10:40.123 --> 10:41.531
-Uh, board it!
-Board it!

10:41.533 --> 10:43.791
Uh, h-hey...

10:43.793 --> 10:45.310
how about that?

10:45.312 --> 10:48.371
The yarn knows something
we're still figuring out.

10:48.373 --> 10:50.297
We're gonna find this turtle,

10:50.299 --> 10:52.817
but damn it,
we found love along the way.

10:52.819 --> 10:56.562
Oh, oh! What if the turtle
was taken by a billionaire

10:56.564 --> 10:59.565
to transfuse his blood
for longevity?

10:59.567 --> 11:00.400
ALL:
Board it.

11:00.402 --> 11:01.826
Mom, are we worried

11:01.828 --> 11:05.722
this group is crossing into
the conspiracy theory zone?

11:05.724 --> 11:08.816
Mmm, as long as he's got
a heavy hand with the saffron,

11:08.818 --> 11:09.893
who cares?

11:09.895 --> 11:11.911
Well, these people are finally

11:11.913 --> 11:13.821
taking your father seriously.

11:13.823 --> 11:14.898
He's not used to that.

11:14.900 --> 11:17.008
Bart, you're always
telling him

11:17.010 --> 11:18.492
his ideas are dumb.

11:18.494 --> 11:20.845
And, Lisa, you're always
proving it.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.515
He deserves a chance
to be a big fish

11:23.517 --> 11:24.924
in a small, weird pond.

11:24.926 --> 11:26.743
So let him have this.

11:26.745 --> 11:28.335
It's all harmless enough.

11:28.337 --> 11:29.746
So it's decided.

11:29.748 --> 11:32.840
We're protesting in front
of the zoo director's house.

11:32.842 --> 11:36.602
I shall bring the milk
in case they tear gas us.

11:36.604 --> 11:38.012
Mm...

11:38.014 --> 11:39.889
ALL:
We can't be more emphatic,

11:39.891 --> 11:42.183
we think Leonard's
in your attic.

11:42.185 --> 11:44.018
Please stop these protests.

11:44.020 --> 11:45.929
Why would I kidnap an animal?

11:45.931 --> 11:47.263
That's what a zoo is:

11:47.265 --> 11:49.040
a bunch of kidnapped animals.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.751
-(stammers)
-It's the cops!

11:54.456 --> 11:56.530
If you're gonna pepper spray me,
do it fast.

11:56.532 --> 11:58.291
I don't have much
phone battery left.

11:58.293 --> 12:01.461
Calm down, I'm not here
as Police Chief Wiggum.

12:01.463 --> 12:04.280
I'm here as Clancy Wiggum,
a simple civilian

12:04.282 --> 12:06.132
hungry for turtle justice.

12:06.134 --> 12:07.467
Justice you'll never get from

12:07.469 --> 12:09.953
a cold, faceless
police department.

12:09.955 --> 12:12.121
Uh-oh, body camera's on.

12:12.123 --> 12:14.307
Don't worry, I can erase it
with a paper clip.

12:14.309 --> 12:16.234
They, uh, they taught us how.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.294
I need to say something
to a woman

12:18.296 --> 12:20.129
I'm very much in love with.

12:20.131 --> 12:22.131
Lizzie, before
this group started,

12:22.133 --> 12:25.559
I was in a shell
of my own making.

12:25.561 --> 12:26.911
Oh, my God.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.396
So I'm poking my head out
and asking

12:29.398 --> 12:31.065
in front of our
new best friends,

12:31.067 --> 12:33.659
will you make me
the happiest man

12:33.661 --> 12:35.420
on this flat earth?

12:36.423 --> 12:38.314
Yes, yes.

12:38.316 --> 12:39.740
I can't wait to spend
the rest of my life

12:39.742 --> 12:42.001
taping together
shredded documents with you.

12:42.003 --> 12:44.429
-Hooray.
-Aw.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.598
Sure, the wedding planning
is a lot of work,

12:46.600 --> 12:49.993
but the group is also learning
how to sweep for spyware

12:49.995 --> 12:51.327
and pick locks.

12:51.329 --> 12:54.847
That's why all our doorknobs
are in that basket.

12:54.849 --> 12:58.759
Homie, I wonder
if your cabal's ideas

12:58.761 --> 13:00.945
are getting maybe a little

13:00.947 --> 13:02.947
too far out of the box?

13:02.949 --> 13:04.282
Thank you, Marge.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.933
You know what's inside boxes?

13:05.935 --> 13:08.194
Styrofoam peanuts and lies.

13:08.196 --> 13:10.363
And I'm tired of being fed both.

13:10.365 --> 13:11.956
-The beauty
of this group is that
-Hmm?

13:11.958 --> 13:14.125
-we always support each other.
There isn't one theory
-Hmm...

13:14.127 --> 13:15.868
-about Leonard that's right.
-Mm.

13:15.870 --> 13:18.371
They're all right.
He could be anywhere.

13:18.373 --> 13:20.857
-Like the kitchen?
-Exactly.

13:20.859 --> 13:25.028
No, he's literally
in the kitchen.

13:25.030 --> 13:26.805
(gasps)
Homer,

13:26.807 --> 13:29.349
did you kidnap Leonard?

13:31.144 --> 13:34.053
No, I didn't commit the crime.

13:34.055 --> 13:36.022
I did something much worse.

13:37.133 --> 13:38.733
I solved it.

13:44.974 --> 13:47.826
Why the hell
is Slow Leonard in our house?

13:47.828 --> 13:49.310
Do I have to tell you?

13:49.312 --> 13:51.721
Can't we just accept this
as the new normal?

13:51.723 --> 13:55.558
There's a 500-pound tortoise
chewing on my kitchen table.

13:55.560 --> 13:57.060
It's not normal.

13:57.062 --> 13:59.062
-Okay, here goes.
-(hisses)

13:59.064 --> 14:00.396
After our protest,

14:00.398 --> 14:02.841
<i> I went back</i>
<i> to the tortoise enclosure</i>

14:02.843 --> 14:04.676
<i> for one last look.</i>

14:05.679 --> 14:06.919
Huh?

14:06.921 --> 14:09.496
My doughnut hole!

14:09.498 --> 14:10.331

14:10.333 --> 14:12.758
Ooh, ooh! Aah! Ow, ow!

14:12.760 --> 14:14.352
(grunts)
Mm?

14:14.354 --> 14:16.579
<i> That's when I discovered</i>
<i> a doughnut hole</i>

14:16.581 --> 14:18.764

14:18.766 --> 14:20.859
<i> a larger hole.</i>

14:20.861 --> 14:23.862
(gasps)
Leonard. You weren't kidnapped.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.030
You were right here all along.

14:26.032 --> 14:29.258
Wait, so after following
all those crazy leads,

14:29.260 --> 14:32.945
you found Leonard by going down
an actual rabbit hole?

14:32.947 --> 14:36.040
-Yeah, so?
-Don't you see the irony?

14:36.042 --> 14:39.026
Oh, now I don't get it.

14:39.028 --> 14:40.453
Anyway...

14:40.455 --> 14:43.548
Guys, you'll never believe it,
but I found...

14:43.550 --> 14:44.716
Just hold that thought.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.534
I made us all evidence
collection fanny packs.

14:47.536 --> 14:51.114
Which we'll all wear
on the pedal bus pub crawl.

14:51.116 --> 14:52.615
Are you coming, Homer?

14:52.617 --> 14:54.375
There's a guac trough
in the middle.

14:55.637 --> 14:59.046
<i> HOMER:</i>
<i> If I told 'em I found him,</i>
<i> the group would end.</i>

14:59.048 --> 15:00.899
How could I let that happen?

15:00.901 --> 15:05.144
Those friendless weirdos have
become my best weird friends.

15:05.146 --> 15:07.630
They're the only people
who don't say "Einstein"

15:07.632 --> 15:10.224
after "great idea,"
or "Sherlock" after...

15:10.226 --> 15:13.227
Oh, you have to
tell them the truth.

15:13.229 --> 15:15.471
Well, the truth
is different these days.

15:15.473 --> 15:17.898
It's more of a hunch
you're willing to die for.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.325
No, it's not!

15:19.327 --> 15:21.661
But tomorrow Gil and
Miss Hoover are getting married

15:21.663 --> 15:23.237
on Chem Trail Island,

15:23.239 --> 15:25.406
and we're all going to wear
matching head shields

15:25.408 --> 15:27.817
so that Bluetooth can't steal
winning lottery numbers

15:27.819 --> 15:29.168
from our brains.

15:29.170 --> 15:31.078
Homer, you solved the mystery.

15:31.080 --> 15:34.173
This confederacy of nutsos
has gone too far.

15:34.175 --> 15:36.492
You're all acting dumb.

15:36.494 --> 15:38.177
(gasps)
Dumb.

15:38.179 --> 15:39.996
You think I'm dumb, Marge?

15:39.998 --> 15:41.439
Just like everyone
at the library

15:41.441 --> 15:44.350
and all the other
smartypantseseseses

15:44.352 --> 15:45.926
in this town?

15:45.928 --> 15:48.688
Well, you can't shame me into
turning my back on my people.

15:48.690 --> 15:51.765
I'm going to that
conspiracy-themed wedding.

15:51.767 --> 15:53.225
And you're no longer
my plus-one,

15:53.227 --> 15:56.287

also uncovered an undying love.

Aw.

Yeah, I, too, have a toast.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.166
To us bringing to justice
the zoo director,

16:42.168 --> 16:44.060
who knows where that turtle is.

16:44.062 --> 16:46.004
-(whimpers)
-Who's got ideas?

16:46.006 --> 16:48.339
Remember, this is a safe space

16:48.341 --> 16:51.067
for all dangerous
and violent plans.

16:51.069 --> 16:53.419

-in her wheel well.
-Board it.

16:59.761 --> 17:03.095
Let's cut the brake lines
on her brand-new Prius.

17:03.097 --> 17:06.082
-Board...
-No, don't board it.

17:06.084 --> 17:08.192
Don't board any of it.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.028
-(all gasp)
-What?
-Why?

17:10.030 --> 17:12.697
Because the zoo director
didn't do anything wrong,

17:12.699 --> 17:15.441
and punishing an innocent
zoo director is...

17:15.443 --> 17:17.518
a bad idea.

17:17.520 --> 17:18.519
(all gasp)

17:18.521 --> 17:21.355
But you said
there were no bad ideas.

17:21.357 --> 17:24.375
I was wrong.
Most ideas are bad.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.770
It's okay to think them,
just don't act on them.

17:27.772 --> 17:29.547
Apostasy!

Them! Them! Them!

17:35.579 --> 17:37.463
Enough is enough!

17:37.465 --> 17:40.207
Look, we have Slow Leonard.
He wasn't kidnapped.

17:40.209 --> 17:44.211
Real, living turtle!

17:44.213 --> 17:45.304
Let's talk sense here.

17:45.306 --> 17:47.065
The most obvious explanation

17:47.067 --> 17:49.067
is the one that's
before our very eyes.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.902
-Hey, it's true.
-Yeah.
-Uh-huh.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.311
Oh, thank God.

17:52.313 --> 17:55.222
This is not Slow Leonard,
this is a robot.

17:55.224 --> 17:58.317
A robot built
by Homeland Security

17:58.319 --> 18:01.804
to scan our tongues
to see whom we've kissed.

18:01.806 --> 18:05.232
We'll prove it. Scan him
with your robot detectors.

18:05.234 --> 18:07.085
Guys, it is the turtle.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.145
And those robot detectors
are made of

18:09.147 --> 18:11.089
hair dryers and old video games.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.407
Look, we had
a great ride together.

18:13.409 --> 18:15.576
The paintball
and pinot noir weekend,

18:15.578 --> 18:17.911
the duck boat tour
of Shelbyville,

18:17.913 --> 18:19.322
storming City Hall.

18:19.324 --> 18:21.657
It felt so good
to be part of a community

18:21.659 --> 18:23.601
Where we're all
respected and supported.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.104
But we can't pull our heads
inside our shells

18:26.106 --> 18:29.014
and hide from
the very real truth:

18:29.016 --> 18:31.758
our lost turtle has been found.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.687
(detector powers down)

18:34.689 --> 18:37.131
I cannot believe
I'm saying this.

18:37.133 --> 18:38.783
It's not a robot.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.860
<i> DETECTOR:</i>
<i> Dr. J, super dunk!</i>

18:40.862 --> 18:42.936
But what happens to all of us

18:42.938 --> 18:44.864
when we don't have
anything to solve?

18:44.866 --> 18:46.532
Nothing has to change.

18:46.534 --> 18:49.869
We have more in common than
just the tortoise, don't we?

18:49.871 --> 18:51.671
Well, we must. Right?

18:52.781 --> 18:55.616
-(sobs)
-Aw, nuts.

18:55.618 --> 18:57.209
Oh, great.

18:57.211 --> 19:00.287
Now I have to get this
lasered off.

19:00.289 --> 19:03.199
I love being in this group,
but it's over.

19:03.201 --> 19:04.958
And now I and the rest of us

19:04.960 --> 19:06.310
have to go back
to a world where

19:06.312 --> 19:08.729
everyone thinks we're dumb.

19:12.710 --> 19:14.377
(panting)
Unless

19:14.379 --> 19:16.896
we find a new mystery
only we can solve.

19:16.898 --> 19:18.397
Like...

19:18.399 --> 19:22.476
Where does calamari
really come from?

19:22.478 --> 19:24.570
Well, the common wisdom
is that it's squid,

19:24.572 --> 19:28.407
but I say there's
no such thing as a squid.

19:28.409 --> 19:29.834
Board it.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.578
Mmm, that's good squid.
(chuckles)

19:32.580 --> 19:34.363
I heard it's pig butt,

19:34.365 --> 19:37.157
but the shadow pig butt counsel
spends billions

19:37.159 --> 19:38.918
quashing those rumors.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.570
Board it.

19:41.572 --> 19:44.089
As long as we're
blowing each other's minds,

19:44.091 --> 19:45.925
I've heard there's
a cartoon show

19:45.927 --> 19:47.760
that can predict the future.

19:47.762 --> 19:49.169
Maybe we can watch it

19:49.171 --> 19:51.314
and find out
what's going to happen.

19:55.678 --> 19:57.086
Board it.

19:57.088 --> 19:58.362
COMIC BOOK GUY:
Indubitably.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.347
-WIGGUM: Making up stuff is fun.
-HOOVER: Yeah. Mm-hmm.

20:00.349 --> 20:03.275
Well, I guess no matter
how crazy and lame people are,

20:03.277 --> 20:07.096
they always want to hang
with other crazy lame-os.

20:07.098 --> 20:10.357
I'm no conspiracy theorist,
but I do wonder

20:10.359 --> 20:14.378
who stands to benefit
from all of... this?

20:14.380 --> 20:16.772
-Space here.
-Multiverse!
-Board it.

20:16.774 --> 20:18.198
-Okay, that's good.
-CHALMERS: And here's
another idea.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.275
-WIGGUM: Oh, that's...
-HOMER: Hold on, I need

20:19.277 --> 20:20.200
-more cards.
-COMIC BOOK GUY: Yes!

20:20.202 --> 20:22.345
<i> (chatter continuing)</i>

20:24.449 --> 20:25.798
Our profits
are through the roof.

20:25.800 --> 20:29.227
We can't make enough yarn,
index cards and ivermectin.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.062
We're in a golden age.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.231
Keep defunding schools, America.

Okay, everybody, today we're
making one of my

20:45.470 --> 20:48.562
favorite dishes:
conspiracy-meeting paella.

20:48.564 --> 20:50.823
It's a great dish
for blowing the lid off

20:50.825 --> 20:54.451
any diabolical plot the
mainstream media won't cover.

20:54.453 --> 20:57.980
CIA murders in your town,
UFO stuff.

20:57.982 --> 20:59.423
And it even pairs well

20:59.425 --> 21:01.984
with a New World Order
scenario.

21:01.986 --> 21:03.577
Now, this is a dish
where the freshness

21:03.579 --> 21:05.504
of the ingredients
really matters,

21:05.506 --> 21:09.008
like this chorizo
made from home-schooled pigs.

21:09.010 --> 21:11.343
If you're a lizard person
watching this,

21:11.345 --> 21:13.996
instead of using chicken,
feel free to go with

21:13.998 --> 21:17.016
whatever insect
or small mammal goes well

21:17.018 --> 21:18.776
with Calasparra rice.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.278
Well, that's all
you need to know.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.521
Let me know in the comments
how it turned out,

21:22.523 --> 21:25.157
and what shape
you think the sun is.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.578
Shh!
