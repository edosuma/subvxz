WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:06.173
Captain's log, stardate 41590.5.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.885
Having dropped off Counselor Troi
for a visit home,

00:10.052 --> 00:13.305
we were fortunately close
to the Sigma III system

00:13.472 --> 00:17.851
when its Federation colony made
an urgent call for medical help.

00:18.018 --> 00:22.022
An accidental explosion has
devastated a mining operation.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.107
Include a burn unit with each kit.

00:24.274 --> 00:28.153
Identify the most critically injured
and beam them to cargo bay six.

00:28.320 --> 00:32.073
- Dr Crusher, this is the Captain.
- Dr Crusher here.

00:32.241 --> 00:37.120
Additional information. The number
of colonists at the site is 504.

00:37.287 --> 00:40.582
- Are you prepared for that many?
- We believe so, sir.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.710
Captain, we are now at warp 9.1, sir.

00:43.919 --> 00:46.880
We will be at the colony
in 3.2 hours, sir.

00:48.298 --> 00:51.009
Schematics suggest
the explosion was caused

00:51.176 --> 00:54.263
by a methane-like gas
seeping in from underground.

00:54.429 --> 00:57.599
Captain, I'm picking up
a force field. It's...

01:05.190 --> 01:09.194
The Q entity. It's identical
to the grid we encountered...

01:09.361 --> 01:12.281
- It reads solid, sir.
- Emergency. Full stop.

01:12.447 --> 01:13.991
Reversing power, sir.

01:14.658 --> 01:16.326
Not now, damn it, Q.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.912
Shields and deflectors up, sir.

01:26.795 --> 01:28.714
Now reading full stop, sir.

01:30.465 --> 01:33.468
Humans. I thought by now
you'd have scampered back

01:33.635 --> 01:35.470
to your own little star system.

01:38.557 --> 01:42.811
If this is Q I'm addressing,
we are on a mission of rescue...

01:42.978 --> 01:47.191
We the Q have studied our contact
with you, and are impressed.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.942
We have much to discuss,

01:49.109 --> 01:53.447
including perhaps the realization
of your most impossible dream.

01:53.614 --> 01:58.452
Intriguing as that is, we are on
an urgent journey. After, perhaps...

01:58.619 --> 02:03.582
You will abandon it! My business
with you takes precedence.

02:04.500 --> 02:09.713
If my magnificence blinds you,
then perhaps something more familiar.

02:13.884 --> 02:17.012
Starfleet Admiral Q, at your service.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:40.619 --> 02:43.705
Space, the final frontier.

02:45.415 --> 02:49.336
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

02:49.503 --> 02:53.590
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...

02:55.425 --> 02:59.096
...to seek out new life
and new civilizations...

03:00.013 --> 03:03.684
...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

04:06.035 --> 04:08.120
Captain's log, supplemental.

04:08.287 --> 04:12.541
Our rescue mission to Sigma III
has been halted by an immense grid

04:12.708 --> 04:15.753
and an untimely visit from Q.

04:16.837 --> 04:19.507
You're no Starfleet Admiral, Q.

04:19.632 --> 04:24.804
Neither am I an Aldebaran serpent,
Captain, but you accepted me as such.

04:24.970 --> 04:26.889
He's got us there, Captain!

04:27.056 --> 04:30.601
The redoubtable Cmdr Riker,
whom I noticed before.

04:30.768 --> 04:33.145
You seem to find this
all very amusing.

04:33.312 --> 04:38.359
I might, if we weren't on our way to
help some suffering, dying humans...

04:38.567 --> 04:41.403
Your species
is always suffering and dying.

04:41.570 --> 04:45.908
No, Lt Worf! Make no move
against him unless I order it.

04:47.118 --> 04:50.704
Pity! You might have learned
an interesting lesson.

04:50.871 --> 04:54.250
Macro head with a micro brain!

04:56.168 --> 05:03.092
You said you had the realization
of impossible dreams to offer us.

05:04.427 --> 05:08.514
When this rescue is completed,
I will listen to your proposal.

05:08.681 --> 05:10.933
Subject to its being acceptable...

05:11.100 --> 05:15.729
Subject to foolish human values?
Picard, why do you distrust me so?

05:16.355 --> 05:20.860
Why? At our first meeting,
you seized my vessel.

05:21.026 --> 05:23.696
You condemned all humans as savages

05:23.863 --> 05:28.325
and tried us in a post-atomic
21st-century court of horrors,

05:28.492 --> 05:31.454
attacked my people
and again seized my vessel!

05:31.620 --> 05:35.624
And that angered you?
"Seized my vessel!"

05:35.791 --> 05:38.711
You interfered with
our Farpoint mission.

05:38.878 --> 05:42.339
You threatened to convict us
as ignorant savages,

05:42.506 --> 05:45.426
if, while dealing with
a powerful life form,

05:45.593 --> 05:48.471
we made any mistake,
and when we didn't...

05:48.637 --> 05:50.890
The Q became interested in you.

05:51.056 --> 05:54.560
Does no one here understand
your good fortune?

05:54.769 --> 05:56.645
"Seized my vessel!"

05:56.812 --> 05:58.898
The complaints of a closed mind,

05:59.064 --> 06:01.776
too accustomed
to military privileges.

06:03.527 --> 06:08.699
But you, Riker, and I remember you
well, what do you make of my offer?

06:08.866 --> 06:11.368
We don't have time for these games.

06:12.286 --> 06:16.165
Games? Did someone say games?

06:17.083 --> 06:21.045
And, perchance for interest's sake,
a deadly game?

06:23.547 --> 06:25.549
To the game.

06:34.683 --> 06:35.893
Where are we?

06:40.898 --> 06:45.319
A Class-M world. Gravity
and oxygen within our limits.

06:46.529 --> 06:49.824
Twin moons. Where are we?

06:51.659 --> 06:57.081
Considering the power demonstrated
by Q the last time... anywhere.

06:58.082 --> 07:00.251
Assuming this place even exists.

07:00.418 --> 07:05.756
But it won't be boring.
If Q is anything, he's imaginative.

07:05.923 --> 07:08.634
Seems our Captain
wasn't meant to be here.

07:10.302 --> 07:12.304
Security, this is the Captain.

07:13.889 --> 07:15.474
Security?

07:18.686 --> 07:20.896
Engineering, this is the bridge.

07:51.844 --> 07:54.054
Turbolift control, do you read?

07:55.014 --> 07:56.599
This is the Captain.

08:02.730 --> 08:04.315
Sir! Over there!

08:05.441 --> 08:09.320
Join me, Riker. A good game
needs rules and planning.

08:10.654 --> 08:12.490
Didn't your own Hartley say,

08:12.656 --> 08:15.993
"Nothing reveals humanity so well
as the games it plays"?

08:17.536 --> 08:19.246
Almost right.

08:19.413 --> 08:22.875
Actually, you reveal yourselves
best in how you play.

08:26.921 --> 08:31.217
Sir, what he has in mind might
provide us with vital information.

08:59.912 --> 09:04.708
Incredible. I was just thinking
about an old-fashioned lemonade.

09:05.543 --> 09:09.755
And so it became that.
An excellent thirst-quencher.

09:09.922 --> 09:12.675
It gets rather hot
out here on this plain.

09:12.883 --> 09:14.677
What about my people?

09:14.844 --> 09:17.054
Whatever they'd like, of course.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.033
"Drink not with thine enemy."

09:38.200 --> 09:42.955
The rigid Klingon code. That explains
something of why you defeated them.

09:45.249 --> 09:50.337
Still fascinated with the human past?
Perhaps you're not that original.

09:50.546 --> 09:53.924
Au contraire. It's the human future
which intrigues us.

09:54.091 --> 09:56.427
And it should concern you the most.

09:56.594 --> 10:00.181
Of all the species,
yours cannot abide stagnation.

10:00.347 --> 10:04.769
Change is the heart of what you are.
But into what? That's the question.

10:04.935 --> 10:08.147
That is what humans call... a truism.

10:08.314 --> 10:13.235
- You mean hardly original?
- You're the one who said it.

10:13.402 --> 10:17.907
While we're at it...
this isn't part of any human future.

10:18.073 --> 10:21.911
True. I borrowed this
from your stodgy Captain's mind.

10:22.078 --> 10:25.039
This is the dressing
for a game we will play.

10:25.206 --> 10:27.875
Now, games require rules, rewards,

10:28.000 --> 10:31.128
dangers, familiar settings.
That sort of thing.

10:31.337 --> 10:34.215
This isn't that familiar to me. Data?

10:35.341 --> 10:40.596
This is from Europe's Napoleonic era.
Late-18th, early-19th centuries.

10:40.763 --> 10:43.432
This is
a campaign-headquarters tent.

10:43.557 --> 10:46.477
His uniform is that
of a French Army marshal.

10:46.644 --> 10:48.437
Outranking even an admiral.

10:48.604 --> 10:52.274
Would I go from a Starfleet admiral
to anything else?

10:52.441 --> 10:54.235
Of course you wouldn't.

10:54.944 --> 10:57.738
But Napoleonic equipment
on an alien planet,

10:57.905 --> 11:00.241
one so different it has twin moons?

11:00.407 --> 11:03.285
As you said,
I am nothing if not imaginative.

11:03.452 --> 11:05.413
The game should reflect that.

11:05.579 --> 11:10.918
Shall it be a test of strength?
Meaningless, since you have none.

11:11.210 --> 11:15.631
A test of intelligence, then?
Equally as meaningless!

11:15.798 --> 11:20.594
But it needs risk, something to win.
And something to lose.

11:21.137 --> 11:24.598
If we must play a game,
what would we win?

11:24.765 --> 11:28.144
The greatest possible future
you can imagine.

11:28.310 --> 11:31.856
Which requires something
totally disastrous if you lose.

11:32.022 --> 11:34.525
The point of this game shall be,

11:34.692 --> 11:37.361
can any of you stay alive?

11:37.528 --> 11:40.406
If your game is fair, we will.

11:41.031 --> 11:42.950
For shame, Worf!

11:43.117 --> 11:47.079
Fairness is such a human concept.
Think imaginatively!

11:47.246 --> 11:50.916
This game shall in fact be...
completely unfair.

11:51.125 --> 11:54.253
- You've gone too far!
- Game penalty!

11:57.798 --> 12:01.051
Where is she, Q?
You can forget your game...

12:01.218 --> 12:04.680
To use a 20th-century term,
she's in a penalty box.

12:04.847 --> 12:08.851
She'll remain there unharmed
unless one of you merits a penalty.

12:09.018 --> 12:11.437
Unfortunately, there's only one box.

12:11.604 --> 12:15.566
If any of you are sent there,
dear Tasha must give the box up.

12:15.733 --> 12:17.777
And where does she go?

12:18.402 --> 12:20.279
Into nothingness!

12:21.155 --> 12:23.908
I entreat you to obey
the rules of the game.

12:24.074 --> 12:29.205
The only one who can destroy
your Tasha now is you.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.320
Captain's log...

13:02.574 --> 13:04.994
Damn it.
I can't even make a log entry.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.330
I wish I could help you, Captain.

13:11.125 --> 13:12.751
Where is everyone else?

13:13.877 --> 13:15.337
Down on some planet.

13:15.504 --> 13:18.424
- Some planet? Why are you here?
- Well, I...

13:21.010 --> 13:22.720
It sounds strange...

13:23.887 --> 13:26.473
...but, I'm in a penalty box.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.517
A penalty box?

13:28.684 --> 13:33.814
Q's penalty box. It sounds strange,
but it definitely isn't.

13:34.607 --> 13:36.942
I know that one more penalty...

13:37.943 --> 13:41.363
...by anyone... and I'm gone.

13:41.530 --> 13:44.074
- Gone?
- Yes! I am gone!

13:47.745 --> 13:51.790
It is so frustrating
to be controlled like this!

13:54.877 --> 13:57.004
Lieutenant...

13:57.171 --> 13:59.089
Tasha, it's alright.

14:00.841 --> 14:04.303
What in the hell am I doing?
Crying?!

14:06.889 --> 14:08.474
Don't worry.

14:10.225 --> 14:12.811
There is a new standing order
on the bridge.

14:12.978 --> 14:17.441
When one is in the penalty box,
tears are permitted.

14:21.070 --> 14:22.655
Captain...

14:25.032 --> 14:27.034
If you weren't a captain...

14:27.910 --> 14:30.829
Consorting with lower-rank females?

14:31.330 --> 14:36.168
Especially ones in penalty boxes?
Destructive to discipline, they say.

14:36.752 --> 14:39.964
But then again, you're what?
Only human.

14:40.506 --> 14:43.467
Penalty... over.

14:54.687 --> 14:56.480
A marshal of France?

14:57.606 --> 14:59.275
Ridiculous!

14:59.441 --> 15:02.486
One takes the jobs he can get.

15:02.653 --> 15:07.992
For example,
starlog entry, stardate today.

15:08.909 --> 15:12.788
This is Q speaking
for Capt Jean-Luc Picard,

15:12.955 --> 15:17.042
who we consider too bound
by Starfleet customs and traditions

15:17.209 --> 15:19.295
to be useful to us.

15:19.461 --> 15:24.049
The Enterprise is now helpless,
stuck like an Earth insect in amber,

15:24.216 --> 15:29.388
while its bridge crew plays out
a game, whose real intent is to test

15:29.555 --> 15:35.102
whether the First Officer is worthy
of the greatest gift the Q can offer.

15:35.269 --> 15:38.022
So, you're taking on Riker this time.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.817
Excellent.
He'll defeat you, just as I did.

15:41.984 --> 15:46.822
Shall we wager on that?
Your starship command against...

15:47.031 --> 15:50.826
Against your keeping out of
humanity's path for ever!

15:51.493 --> 15:54.747
- Done?
- Done. You've already lost.

15:54.914 --> 15:58.918
Riker will be offered something
impossible to refuse.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.601
Geordi, can you see Worf?

16:15.768 --> 16:19.063
I'd see the freckles on his nose
if he had them, sir.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.731
He's at the third ridge.

16:20.898 --> 16:22.483
The third ridge?

16:22.650 --> 16:24.234
Moving well, too.

16:26.779 --> 16:29.031
Good. He sees them.

17:04.775 --> 17:08.988
Listen to me, Q. You seem
to have some need for humans.

17:09.780 --> 17:11.906
Concern regarding them.

17:12.074 --> 17:15.743
Why do you demonstrate it
through this confrontation?

17:15.911 --> 17:20.040
Why not a simple, direct explanation,
a statement of what you seek?

17:20.207 --> 17:22.001
Why these games?

17:22.626 --> 17:25.546
Why these games?
Why, the play's the thing!

17:25.713 --> 17:30.134
I'm surprised you need ask. Your
human Shakespeare explained it all.

17:30.301 --> 17:32.636
He did
but don't depend on one view...

17:32.803 --> 17:35.889
A pity you don't know
the content of your own library.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.225
Hear this, and reflect.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.937
"All the galaxy's a stage..."

17:42.146 --> 17:45.065
World, not galaxy.
"All the world's a stage."

17:45.232 --> 17:49.028
You know it. If he were
living now, he'd have said galaxy.

17:49.194 --> 17:53.949
How about this?
"Life is but a walking shadow,

17:54.116 --> 17:58.746
a poor player that struts
and frets his hour upon the stage

17:58.913 --> 18:01.248
and then is heard no more."

18:02.041 --> 18:04.627
"It is a tale told by an idiot,

18:04.793 --> 18:08.964
full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing."

18:09.757 --> 18:13.761
I see. So how we respond to a game
tells you more about us

18:13.928 --> 18:18.891
than our real life?
This... tale told by an idiot.

18:19.058 --> 18:20.225
Interesting.

18:20.392 --> 18:24.271
Thank you. Glad you enjoyed it.
Perhaps a little Hamlet?

18:24.480 --> 18:29.652
I know Hamlet. What he might say
with irony, I say with conviction.

18:29.818 --> 18:34.239
"What a piece of work is man.
How noble in reason."

18:34.406 --> 18:36.033
"How infinite in faculty."

18:36.200 --> 18:39.578
"In form, in moving,
how express and admirable."

18:39.745 --> 18:44.667
"In action, how like an angel.
In apprehension, how like a god."

18:45.793 --> 18:48.170
You don't see your species like that?

18:48.337 --> 18:51.548
I see us one day becoming that, Q.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.885
Is it that which concerns you?

19:02.518 --> 19:06.814
Those soldiers have formed
a skirmishing line, I think it is.

19:06.981 --> 19:09.358
And they're headed this way.

19:09.525 --> 19:12.027
Armed with ball-and-powder muskets?

19:12.194 --> 19:14.113
That's what they look like, sir.

19:14.280 --> 19:18.284
Muskets are appropriate to the
1790-1800 French uniform, sir.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.911
But it is hardly a weapon
by our standards.

19:21.078 --> 19:25.583
A lead ball propelled by gunpowder.
100 meters at best, with accuracy.

19:25.749 --> 19:30.588
Against phasers? Just one phaser
could finish off an entire regiment.

19:30.754 --> 19:35.384
Except that it hardly sounds like Q
to give us an advantage like that.

19:36.635 --> 19:38.304
Unless...

19:45.519 --> 19:46.812
Drop your weapons!

19:47.479 --> 19:51.734
That was me, Worf. I was checking
that the phasers still operate.

19:53.152 --> 19:55.946
Incredible. He came out of nowhere.

19:57.406 --> 19:58.782
A warrior's reaction.

19:58.949 --> 20:00.993
Report. What did you find?

20:01.160 --> 20:06.206
They may wear old Earth uniforms,
but they aren't human at all.

20:06.999 --> 20:09.168
More like vicious animal things.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.052
Those soldiers
are moving in fast, sir.

20:21.180 --> 20:24.892
Data, if you've got a theory
about what's happening...

20:27.478 --> 20:30.564
Think fast, Cmdr Riker,
and move fast.

20:43.577 --> 20:45.704
Those aren't muskets!

20:51.543 --> 20:55.547
You have one chance to save them.
Send them back to the ship.

20:56.215 --> 20:57.758
You'll let me beam them?

20:57.967 --> 21:01.595
Send them the same way I do.
I've given you the power.

21:01.762 --> 21:05.599
Do you understand?
I've given you the power of the Q.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.601
Use it.

21:12.982 --> 21:14.608
Use your power.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.325
Use your power.

21:58.465 --> 22:01.802
Lieutenant, take the conn position.
Engineering?

22:01.969 --> 22:05.139
- Engineering, sir.
- Are all systems back on line?

22:05.306 --> 22:07.766
Back on line, sir?
They were never off.

22:11.020 --> 22:13.480
Captain, you'd better look at this.

22:14.481 --> 22:19.236
There's been no interruption in
course or speed. Both are constant.

22:19.528 --> 22:21.697
It's as though we never stopped.

22:23.073 --> 22:24.867
We never did, Lieutenant.

22:25.993 --> 22:28.162
Q suspended time.

22:33.709 --> 22:36.962
- Where's Cmdr Riker?
- He was with us.

22:37.129 --> 22:39.256
He must still be on the planet.

22:39.965 --> 22:43.844
We were under attack
by these... animal things.

22:44.553 --> 22:49.058
- Animal things?
- Maybe Data can explain better, sir.

22:50.392 --> 22:54.313
You may find it aesthetically
displeasing. I'll file a report.

22:54.480 --> 22:55.231
Data...

22:55.397 --> 22:58.859
Sir, the important thing is
why is Cmdr Riker missing?

22:59.068 --> 23:03.072
Understood. But I suspect
Cmdr Riker is perfectly safe,

23:03.239 --> 23:05.157
at least in a physical sense.

23:05.741 --> 23:08.827
Q has an interest in him.

23:08.994 --> 23:12.623
In fact, Q's entire visit
concerns our First Officer.

23:12.790 --> 23:15.918
- And the reason for that, sir?
- I wish I knew.

23:16.085 --> 23:19.463
Q first became interested in him
at Farpoint.

23:19.630 --> 23:21.632
I have no idea what it means.

23:21.799 --> 23:25.177
Meanwhile, we must proceed
with our rescue mission.

23:43.779 --> 23:47.950
Something amuses you? Perhaps
you'll share the joke with me.

23:48.117 --> 23:49.451
The joke is you!

23:50.202 --> 23:52.246
Strange gratitude,

23:52.413 --> 23:56.917
from one who has been granted a gift
beyond any human dream.

24:00.087 --> 24:04.758
How can you not appreciate being able
to send your friends to their ship,

24:04.925 --> 24:09.221
or send the soldiers back to the
nothingness from which they came?

24:09.930 --> 24:14.435
You must understand that you can
send yourself back to the ship,

24:14.643 --> 24:18.606
or to Earth, or change your shape,
become anything you want to be.

24:18.772 --> 24:21.692
- What do you need?
- Need?

24:21.859 --> 24:24.528
You want something from us.
Desperately.

24:24.653 --> 24:29.491
Want something from you foolish,
fragile nonentities? Come, Riker!

24:29.700 --> 24:32.411
You sound like your Captain.

24:32.578 --> 24:35.623
Now, that's a compliment, Q,
but not an answer.

24:41.670 --> 24:46.800
Riker, we have offered you a gift
beyond all other gifts!

24:47.718 --> 24:49.720
Out of the goodness of your heart.

24:54.934 --> 25:00.189
After Farpoint, I returned
to where we exist, the Q Continuum.

25:00.356 --> 25:02.024
Which means what?

25:02.191 --> 25:05.986
The limitless dimensions
of the galaxy in which we exist.

25:06.153 --> 25:09.240
- I don't understand.
- Of course you don't.

25:09.406 --> 25:12.618
And you never will,
until you become one of us.

25:12.785 --> 25:16.038
Until? Would you mind
going over that again?

25:17.248 --> 25:19.792
If you'd stop interrupting me!

25:19.959 --> 25:24.797
This is hardly a time to be teaching
you the true nature of the universe.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.342
However...

25:29.677 --> 25:34.181
At Farpoint...
we saw you as savages only.

25:34.932 --> 25:38.519
We discovered instead
that you are unusual creatures...

25:39.395 --> 25:42.565
...in your own limited ways.

25:43.274 --> 25:46.277
Ways which, in time,
will not be so limited.

25:46.443 --> 25:48.529
We're growing.

25:48.696 --> 25:52.908
Something about us
compels us to learn, explore.

25:53.075 --> 25:54.952
Yes, the human compulsion.

25:55.119 --> 25:58.414
Unfortunately for us,
this power will grow stronger,

25:58.581 --> 26:01.250
century after century,
aeon after aeon.

26:01.417 --> 26:06.171
Aeons... Have you any idea
how far we'll advance?

26:06.338 --> 26:11.552
Perhaps in a future that you cannot
yet conceive, even beyond us.

26:12.553 --> 26:16.265
You see, we must know more
about this human compulsion.

26:16.765 --> 26:20.185
That's why we selected you
to become part of the Q,

26:20.352 --> 26:23.522
so you can bring to us
this human need and hunger,

26:23.689 --> 26:25.941
that we may better understand it.

26:26.358 --> 26:29.153
I suppose that's meant
as a compliment.

26:30.696 --> 26:33.240
Or maybe it's my limited mind.

26:33.407 --> 26:35.826
But to become a part of you?

26:36.535 --> 26:37.912
I don't even like you.

26:39.663 --> 26:41.665
You're gonna miss me.

26:54.303 --> 26:56.263
Come on! Not again!

27:05.147 --> 27:09.360
Cmdr Riker, what's going on?
I was sitting in school and...

27:09.526 --> 27:12.238
Worf! My phaser's gone.
Are you armed?

27:13.447 --> 27:14.448
No.

27:19.245 --> 27:22.915
Where is Q? lf you have an answer
to any of this...

27:55.823 --> 27:56.991
Look out!

27:57.157 --> 27:58.659
Wesley! No!

28:02.705 --> 28:03.956
No, damn it!

28:04.123 --> 28:05.791
Damn it to hell!

28:10.004 --> 28:11.088
You... !

28:11.255 --> 28:13.591
You did that!

28:14.466 --> 28:16.051
And that's not all!

28:31.942 --> 28:34.153
That grid, their wounds...

28:35.696 --> 28:37.698
Only the Q can do that.

28:47.599 --> 28:50.978
Captain's log, stardate 41591.4.

28:51.186 --> 28:53.647
1 minutes out
from Quadra Sigma III,

28:53.814 --> 28:57.151
where the survivors of a disaster
desperately need us.

28:57.317 --> 29:00.571
On the Enterprise,
First Officer William T Riker

29:00.738 --> 29:02.823
needs help nearly as badly.

29:02.990 --> 29:06.535
But this is a subject
far out of my experience.

29:06.702 --> 29:09.079
Out of any human's experience.

29:15.252 --> 29:17.379
How the hell do I advise you?

29:18.922 --> 29:21.592
You know the implications
as well as I.

29:23.510 --> 29:27.097
No one has ever offered
to turn me into a god before.

29:27.681 --> 29:31.560
What the Q has offered you
has to be close to immortality.

29:31.769 --> 29:34.563
It's no lie
about controlling time and space.

29:34.730 --> 29:38.567
- We've seen it in what they can do.
- And in what I can do.

29:39.485 --> 29:43.614
If you are to refuse his offer,
you must not use this power again.

29:43.781 --> 29:47.660
It's too great a temptation
at our present stage of development.

29:47.826 --> 29:49.870
You fear I won't be able to say no?

29:50.037 --> 29:55.793
You tell me. Are you strong enough
to refuse to use that power?

29:55.959 --> 29:57.002
Certainly.

29:57.169 --> 30:01.006
No matter how tempted?
No matter how difficult Q makes it?

30:03.175 --> 30:04.843
You have my word.

30:05.552 --> 30:08.639
Good. I know what your word means.

30:08.847 --> 30:10.974
In orbit of Quadra Sigma III.

30:11.141 --> 30:15.437
Ready to beam down rescue team
to underground emergency area.

30:29.618 --> 30:31.370
This way, sir.

30:49.972 --> 30:51.974
Are there any others?

30:52.141 --> 30:54.685
Gone. It's just us.

31:02.192 --> 31:03.777
Commander!

31:08.741 --> 31:10.951
There's somebody under here!

31:21.337 --> 31:23.255
You're getting close, Data.

31:40.356 --> 31:43.317
It's too late. She's dead.

31:46.945 --> 31:49.615
If only we'd gotten here
a little sooner.

31:50.908 --> 31:54.370
Sir, if indeed
you have the power of Q...

31:57.998 --> 32:02.044
I don't understand. Certainly
you can't bring her back to life.

32:02.211 --> 32:06.674
I can't. I'm prevented from that
by a promise.

32:32.449 --> 32:37.454
I was wrong to make that agreement.
I could have saved that child.

32:37.621 --> 32:42.584
You were right not to try. Once you
get accustomed to that power...

32:42.751 --> 32:46.088
When I used it before,
I saved most of our bridge crew!

32:46.296 --> 32:48.841
And when you grow to like it
too much?

32:49.883 --> 32:52.052
As soon as it's convenient,

32:52.219 --> 32:54.972
I want a meeting with you
and your bridge staff.

32:55.139 --> 32:58.267
As soon as we are secure
with this rescue operation,

32:58.434 --> 33:01.186
I'll discuss all
that this new power...

33:27.880 --> 33:30.090
We can confer here,
if no one objects.

33:30.257 --> 33:33.635
The bridge is fine.
I've called the entire staff.

33:33.802 --> 33:36.805
Correction.
Knowing the decision you face,

33:36.972 --> 33:39.516
I have permitted you this gathering.

33:40.184 --> 33:41.477
Of course, Jean-Luc.

33:50.694 --> 33:52.821
Wesley, this meeting is not for you.

33:52.988 --> 33:56.325
Why not, sir? You helped
make me a bridge officer.

33:57.284 --> 33:59.328
Acting Ensign.

33:59.495 --> 34:01.372
Alright. He stays.

34:11.382 --> 34:15.803
Because I've been given unusual
powers, I'm not suddenly a monster.

34:15.969 --> 34:20.474
Except for these abilities,
and I don't yet know how far they go,

34:20.641 --> 34:23.851
I'm the same William T Riker
you've always known.

34:27.356 --> 34:28.732
Well?

34:32.902 --> 34:35.197
Everyone still looks uncomfortable.

34:36.114 --> 34:39.868
Perhaps they all remember
that saying, "power corrupts."

34:40.034 --> 34:42.996
And absolute power
corrupts absolutely.

34:43.205 --> 34:46.583
You believe I haven't thought
of that, Jean-Luc?

34:46.750 --> 34:51.170
And have you noticed how you and I
are now on a first-name basis?

34:52.630 --> 34:54.425
Number One.

34:54.591 --> 34:58.220
Will...
something has happened already.

35:00.139 --> 35:01.724
In what way?

35:01.890 --> 35:05.894
Haven't you seen how much
I regretted not saving that child?

35:06.061 --> 35:09.356
Using the power of Q to save her
may not have been wrong.

35:09.523 --> 35:13.527
No more than it was wrong to save you
from those soldier things.

35:13.694 --> 35:18.407
Let's keep in mind that that
particular danger was invented by Q.

35:18.574 --> 35:23.329
What we represent to the Q,
Commander, are lowly animals,

35:23.537 --> 35:27.124
tormented into performing
for their amusement.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.877
Actually,
they think very highly of us.

35:31.045 --> 35:35.174
We have a quality of growth
which they admire.

35:35.341 --> 35:36.842
Or fear.

35:38.552 --> 35:42.431
No, we've learned the Q
do not admire us.

35:43.557 --> 35:45.559
The Q has muddled your mind.

35:46.101 --> 35:50.022
Don't you understand
his incredible gift to me?

35:51.273 --> 35:55.194
Are these truly your friends,
brother?

36:09.778 --> 36:14.282
Let us pray.
For understanding and for compassion.

36:14.449 --> 36:19.329
Let us do no such damn thing! What is
this need of yours for costumes?

36:19.496 --> 36:21.498
Have you no identity of your own?

36:21.665 --> 36:23.833
I come in search of the truth.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.920
You come in search
of what humanity is!

36:27.087 --> 36:29.422
I forgive your blasphemy!

36:35.136 --> 36:36.721
Don't you see, Riker?

36:36.888 --> 36:41.309
He's nothing but a flimflam man.
He has been since we met at Farpoint!

36:42.060 --> 36:43.603
Flimflam?

36:43.770 --> 36:46.147
You offer Riker jealousy.

36:46.314 --> 36:49.776
What I offer
is clearly beyond your comprehension.

36:49.943 --> 36:52.404
How can you claim
friendship for Riker,

36:52.571 --> 36:57.742
while obstructing the greatest
adventure ever offered a human?

36:57.909 --> 37:01.913
Obstructing? Then it's not certain.
He's not yet committed.

37:02.080 --> 37:05.542
The truly evil part of this
is your jealousy.

37:06.251 --> 37:08.837
You love each one of your people.

37:09.004 --> 37:12.048
Demonstrate it. You have the power

37:12.215 --> 37:16.219
to leave each one of them with a gift
proving your affection.

37:16.636 --> 37:21.474
There'd be no harm to give them
something I know they'd like?

37:22.517 --> 37:24.519
How touching!

37:24.686 --> 37:27.480
A plea to his former Captain.

37:27.647 --> 37:32.777
"May I please give happiness
to my friends, sir? Please, sir?"

37:35.697 --> 37:39.784
In fact, I authorize and support
your idea, Riker.

37:42.162 --> 37:45.832
Please, feel free to cooperate
with him if you wish.

37:48.209 --> 37:50.712
- Are you certain, sir?
- Quite certain.

37:50.879 --> 37:54.507
By all means,
demonstrate your gifts of affection.

37:57.302 --> 38:01.473
Don't be frightened. There is
no way I could harm any of you.

38:04.351 --> 38:06.228
Shall I guess your dreams?

38:10.982 --> 38:13.235
We'll leave now, Wesley.

38:13.401 --> 38:17.864
No! Wesley I may know best of all.
Our friendship, our long talks...

38:18.031 --> 38:19.616
No, please!

38:19.783 --> 38:22.911
Have your favorite wish,
my young friend.

38:26.223 --> 38:29.184
You're ten years older. A man!

38:37.276 --> 38:38.735
Not bad!

38:43.657 --> 38:45.075
No!

38:46.285 --> 38:47.411
No, sir.

38:47.578 --> 38:50.998
But it's what you've always wanted,
to become human.

38:51.707 --> 38:53.584
Yes, sir. That is true.

38:54.710 --> 38:59.965
But I never wanted to compound
one... illusion with another.

39:01.133 --> 39:03.719
It might be real to Q...

39:04.469 --> 39:06.054
...perhaps even you, sir.

39:06.930 --> 39:08.932
But it would never be so to me.

39:09.850 --> 39:13.729
Was it not one of the Captain's
favorite authors who wrote,

39:13.896 --> 39:17.316
"This above all:
to thine own self be true"?

39:19.359 --> 39:22.362
Sorry, Commander, I must decline.

39:28.660 --> 39:32.748
And you, my friend.
I know what you want.

40:07.157 --> 40:09.827
You're as beautiful as I imagined.

40:10.911 --> 40:12.871
And more.

40:13.956 --> 40:16.375
Then we can throw away the visor?

40:20.838 --> 40:22.506
I don't think so, sir.

40:22.673 --> 40:25.342
The price is a little too high
for me.

40:25.926 --> 40:29.513
And... I don't like
who I'd have to thank.

40:36.103 --> 40:38.105
Make me the way I was.

40:41.733 --> 40:43.235
Please!

41:00.752 --> 41:03.130
Proud warrior Worf!

41:04.047 --> 41:06.717
Without a single tie
to his own kind.

41:56.058 --> 41:57.434
No!

41:59.520 --> 42:02.064
She is from a world now alien to me!

42:03.440 --> 42:06.735
Worf, is this your idea of sex?

42:07.402 --> 42:09.321
This is sex.

42:10.864 --> 42:13.450
But I have no place
for it in my life now!

42:13.992 --> 42:17.246
No place, micro brain?
What possesses you?

42:22.543 --> 42:25.796
Cmdr Riker, it's too soon for this.

42:25.963 --> 42:28.507
Is this because your mother objects?

42:28.674 --> 42:30.425
No.

42:33.178 --> 42:37.474
I just want to get there
on my own. Honest.

42:40.894 --> 42:44.398
But it's easier, boy!
Listen to Riker!

42:51.280 --> 42:53.157
How did you know, sir?

42:53.657 --> 42:55.534
I feel like such an idiot.

42:55.701 --> 42:58.036
Quite right. So you should.

43:03.458 --> 43:05.836
It's over.
You have no business here.

43:06.003 --> 43:07.880
You have destroyed yourself.

43:08.046 --> 43:10.340
- Pay off your wager.
- I recall none!

43:10.507 --> 43:14.136
Your fellow Q know you agreed
never to trouble humans again,

43:14.344 --> 43:17.764
just as they know you failed
to tempt a human to join you.

43:17.931 --> 43:19.975
No! lf I can do one more thing...

43:20.142 --> 43:24.271
I strongly suspect it's some
explaining you have to do now.

43:46.418 --> 43:47.794
Extraordinary!

43:47.961 --> 43:51.882
Captain, we are showing
that same hole in time again.

43:52.049 --> 43:56.136
Our instruments say we just
beamed back from our rescue mission.

43:56.345 --> 43:59.765
Sir, how is it that the Q can...

44:00.682 --> 44:04.853
...handle time and space so well,
and us so badly?

44:05.020 --> 44:07.189
Perhaps someday we will discover

44:07.356 --> 44:11.360
that space and time
are simpler than the human equation.

44:15.572 --> 44:18.116
No coordinates laid in, Number One?

44:19.159 --> 44:22.621
Yes, sir.
You have my coordinates, La Forge.

44:22.788 --> 44:24.289
Aye, sir.

44:24.456 --> 44:26.041
On the board.

44:31.588 --> 44:33.257
Engage.
