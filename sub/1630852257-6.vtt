- He's my team.

28:43.723 --> 28:44.974
- I like the texture.

28:45.016 --> 28:48.436
Not too hard and not too soft,
but just right.

28:48.478 --> 28:50.730
- Thank you.
- I find the flavors good.

28:50.772 --> 28:51.981
I'm enjoying it.

28:52.023 --> 28:54.109
- Tell us about
your savory main dish.

28:54.150 --> 28:56.486
- So we did our version
of an eggs benedict,

28:56.528 --> 29:00.031
Chesapeake style.
So we made a wild mushroom tart

29:00.073 --> 29:02.158
and then we did
a Maryland crab cake.

29:02.200 --> 29:05.078
And an egg on top of that
with some hollandaise.

29:05.120 --> 29:08.206
- The crab is
absolutely delicious.

29:08.248 --> 29:09.791
- Thank you.
- The flavor profile.

29:09.833 --> 29:13.086
And you can see the crab.
We got lots of crab in there.

29:15.213 --> 29:16.965
- Mmm.
- So I'm not complaining.

29:17.007 --> 29:18.133
I'm happy.

29:18.174 --> 29:19.843
- Thank you.
- It's delicious.

29:19.884 --> 29:21.970
Of course, me, I would like a
little more mm to it, you know?

29:22.012 --> 29:23.471
'Cause I make these a lot.

29:23.513 --> 29:25.390
A little cayenne pepper,
but it's very good.

29:25.432 --> 29:28.143
- It's balance here with
you ladies. Some like it hot.

29:29.644 --> 29:31.479
- Okay, gentlemen,
tell us about your dessert.

29:31.521 --> 29:34.149
- So, this trifle is one
of the center pieces

29:34.190 --> 29:36.401
that we have
on the table frequently.

29:36.443 --> 29:37.986
- You have to dig down
but it stays pretty.

29:38.028 --> 29:39.696
- Oh, how lovely.

29:39.738 --> 29:43.283
- It's fresh raspberries on the
bottom with a raspberry jam.

29:43.324 --> 29:45.452
So then you layer it
with sponge cake

29:45.493 --> 29:47.162
and you redo it three times.

29:47.203 --> 29:49.372
- So does the sponge cake
get soaked?

29:49.414 --> 29:53.001
- Yes, it's soaked in that
raspberry sherry concoction.

29:53.043 --> 29:54.544
- Oh, there's sherry
up in here?

29:56.087 --> 29:57.339
- Here's the extra custard.

29:57.380 --> 30:00.050
- Crème anglaise.
- Oh, yes, custard.

30:00.091 --> 30:02.010
- I'll tell you,
it looks beautiful.

30:02.052 --> 30:04.554
And the red screams holiday.

30:04.596 --> 30:06.431
- It really does.
- Thank you.

30:06.473 --> 30:09.100
- Made me want just
another note of flavor.

30:09.142 --> 30:10.977
- Perhaps.
And a different texture.

30:11.019 --> 30:13.813
I just would've liked something
that might've given my mouth

30:13.855 --> 30:16.232
a little interest,
maybe a crunch here or there.

30:16.274 --> 30:20.695
But the crème anglaise
is absolutely beautiful.

30:20.737 --> 30:23.365
You can put that on anything
and it would be delicious.

30:23.406 --> 30:25.825
A toast in the morning,
it would be good.

30:25.867 --> 30:28.870
- That sponge cake did exactly
what it was supposed to do.

30:28.912 --> 30:30.872
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

30:30.914 --> 30:32.832
- It's delicious.
Thank you.

30:32.874 --> 30:34.292
- It's divine.
- It is.

30:34.334 --> 30:36.503
- Thank you.
- Obscene.

30:36.544 --> 30:37.754
- Yeah, it is obscene.
It really is.

30:37.796 --> 30:40.548
- It really is
obscenely delicious.

30:40.590 --> 30:42.342
Bravo.
- Thank you.

30:42.384 --> 30:44.844
- Bravo, bravo.
- Thank you. Appreciate it.

30:44.886 --> 30:47.430
- I am so blown away with what
the Grannies are saying.

30:47.472 --> 30:48.640
- It means a lot to us.

30:48.682 --> 30:52.602
It would feel incredible
for us to win.

30:52.644 --> 30:53.978
That was good.
- It's all good.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.439
But coming into this,
it was about the experience,

30:56.481 --> 30:58.983
win or lose,
of doing this alongside

30:59.025 --> 31:00.568
<i>one of my favorite people
in the world.</i>

31:00.610 --> 31:03.238
Thank you for doing this
with me.

31:03.279 --> 31:04.656
- Thank you.
- I love you.

31:04.698 --> 31:06.032
- An absolute pleasure.
I love you, too.

31:06.074 --> 31:07.242
- I appreciate you.

31:07.283 --> 31:09.619
- That cream, could lick it.

31:10.870 --> 31:13.957
- Jessica and Stephanie,
please come join us.

31:13.998 --> 31:15.625
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

31:15.667 --> 31:18.128
- Very pretty.
- Those decorations.

31:18.169 --> 31:20.005
- Very nice.
- Look at that pavlova.

31:20.046 --> 31:21.256
Beautiful.

31:21.297 --> 31:23.299
- Oh, wow.

31:23.341 --> 31:25.468
- Okay, tell us about
your tree ornaments.

31:25.510 --> 31:28.888
- The tree ornaments are lemon
cardamom shortbread cookies

31:28.930 --> 31:33.268
and we printed on edible rice
paper some family portraits.

31:33.309 --> 31:36.938
So we wanted to bring a little
bit of our family to you today.

31:36.980 --> 31:39.274
- Let's see.
- Oh.

31:39.315 --> 31:40.567
- Look at this. How cute.

31:40.608 --> 31:42.569
- Your husband is gorgeous,
okay?

31:42.610 --> 31:44.946
- He's such a good-looking guy.

31:44.988 --> 31:46.448
He's handsome.

31:46.489 --> 31:48.199
- The appearance is lovely.

31:48.241 --> 31:51.202
It's done beautifully.
Just perfectly.

31:51.244 --> 31:53.872
And this frame.
- I hated to break it.

31:53.913 --> 31:56.416
- With the picture, it really
is exceptional.

31:56.458 --> 31:58.585
The cookie,
I haven't tasted yet.

31:59.961 --> 32:01.963
- So it's got lemon
and cardamom in it

32:02.005 --> 32:03.298
and it's a shortbread.

32:03.340 --> 32:05.550
- That's a good cookie.
- Oh, thank you.

32:05.592 --> 32:07.802
- Maybe a touch less lemon.

32:07.844 --> 32:09.095
- Okay.

32:09.137 --> 32:12.307
- I'll tell you, the creativity
is over the top.

32:12.349 --> 32:14.434
The cookie, itself,
is delicious.

32:14.476 --> 32:16.144
I love that lemon.

32:16.186 --> 32:17.520
This is right paper?

32:17.562 --> 32:19.105
- Yes.
- Okay.

32:19.147 --> 32:21.775
The only thing, chewing it
is a little tough. That's all.

32:21.816 --> 32:24.611
- The rice paper is good.
- It really was clever.

32:24.652 --> 32:26.029
- Very.
- Thank you.

32:26.071 --> 32:27.489
- Amazing. Mm-hmm.

32:27.530 --> 32:28.907
- Tell us about
your savory dish.

32:28.948 --> 32:32.243
- We made bacon, chive,
and cheddar scones.

32:32.285 --> 32:34.746
We make these at my house
all of the time.

32:34.788 --> 32:36.664
But I have one daughter
who's vegetarian

32:36.706 --> 32:39.876
so we always do just
the cheese and the chives.

32:39.918 --> 32:41.127
But Stephanie loves bacon.

32:41.169 --> 32:42.337
- My family loves bacon.

32:42.379 --> 32:43.713
- I know some of you
love bacon.

32:43.755 --> 32:46.883
So then we also did
a whipped herb butter

32:46.925 --> 32:48.677
as well to go with that.

32:48.718 --> 32:51.513
- Very light. Not heavy.
- It's amazing.

32:51.554 --> 32:53.890
- I've had some scones
that were bricks.

32:53.932 --> 32:55.433
This is not one of them.

32:55.475 --> 32:59.688
The butter just adds to it.
And the flavor is just great.

32:59.729 --> 33:02.315
- Thank you so much.
- I needed the butter

33:02.357 --> 33:04.109
because I'm a butter person
to begin with.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.819
- Me too.
- But excellent flavor.

33:05.860 --> 33:07.028
And thanks for the bacon.

33:07.070 --> 33:08.905
- It's dessert time.

33:08.947 --> 33:12.200
- We made a passion
fruit pavlova.

33:12.242 --> 33:14.369
It has a passion fruit curd,

33:14.411 --> 33:16.371
it's got vanilla bean
whipped cream,

33:16.413 --> 33:18.581
kiwi, mango, some pomegranate,

33:18.623 --> 33:22.544
and then the whipped
coconut ganache.

33:22.585 --> 33:24.004
- This is wonderful.

33:24.045 --> 33:26.798
- It's got the crisp bite
that you look for.

33:26.840 --> 33:30.010
It's got the chewiness
on the inside.

33:30.051 --> 33:32.220
I love the tropical flavors.

33:32.262 --> 33:34.180
They really are delicious
with this.

33:34.222 --> 33:35.515
And that vanilla cream

33:35.557 --> 33:37.892
works beautifully in this,
with the fruit.

33:37.934 --> 33:41.521
- This is a show-stopper.
I mean, seriously.

33:41.563 --> 33:44.858
Just perfect on the outside
and just creamy

33:44.899 --> 33:47.193
and delicious and silky.

33:47.235 --> 33:50.030
And it is a Gigi Diggity.

33:50.071 --> 33:53.908
- Whoo!
- Ohh!

33:53.950 --> 33:56.036
- It's so beautiful.

33:56.077 --> 33:57.954
And it's so festive.

33:57.996 --> 34:01.374
- It's absolutely delicious.
Fluffy, light, the whole bit.

34:01.416 --> 34:03.626
- Yes.
- Girls, kudos.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.797
- And we have one more to go.

34:07.839 --> 34:10.550
- Did you see the instructions
Amy left for when we leave?

34:10.592 --> 34:12.469
- No.
- It's a lot.

34:12.510 --> 34:16.222
- Like what?
- Like, clean all the kitchens.

34:16.264 --> 34:18.099
- Jeez.
- Put the Christmas trees

34:18.141 --> 34:19.434
into a wood chipper.

34:19.476 --> 34:21.978
- Jeez.
- Who knows how to do that?

34:22.020 --> 34:24.230
Sharpen the antlers
on the chandelier.

34:24.272 --> 34:25.648
- Demanding.

34:30.945 --> 34:32.655
<i>♪ ♪</i>

34:32.697 --> 34:35.325
- Niyati and Abhi,
please join us.

34:35.367 --> 34:36.826
- Hello.
- Hi.

34:36.868 --> 34:38.453
- Here we go.
- How are you?

34:38.495 --> 34:39.579
- Oh, my, my. Oh, my, my.

34:39.621 --> 34:42.749
- Oh, wow.
- Ooh.

34:42.791 --> 34:45.919
- In an iron skillet much less.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.003
- Just lovely.

34:47.045 --> 34:49.005
- Tell us about your
tree ornaments.

34:49.047 --> 34:52.008
- We made orange
and rosemary cookies.

34:52.050 --> 34:53.677
- Some designs themed
around our wedding.

34:53.718 --> 34:55.261
- Themed around our wedding.

34:55.303 --> 34:58.973
So we have a groom and a bride.
We have a wedding cake.

34:59.015 --> 35:00.892
- And also our names
written on it

35:00.934 --> 35:04.270
in Hindi, how they were
on our wedding card.

35:04.312 --> 35:05.563
Aww!

35:05.605 --> 35:07.607
- So sweet.

35:07.649 --> 35:08.983
- It tastes very good.

35:09.025 --> 35:11.569
I'm getting the cardamom,
I'm getting the spices,

35:11.611 --> 35:13.905
they're very nicely balanced.

35:13.947 --> 35:17.450
The cookie is just a little bit
on the dry side.

35:17.492 --> 35:19.536
I like my cookies
a little moister.

35:19.577 --> 35:20.829
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:20.870 --> 35:22.372
- That doesn't
bother me at all.

35:22.414 --> 35:24.207
I mean, it's really good.

35:24.249 --> 35:25.917
- It is.
- It's so different.

35:25.959 --> 35:28.378
I mean, it's different from
what I'm used to, for sure.

35:28.420 --> 35:29.587
I think it's adorable.

35:29.629 --> 35:31.006
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

35:31.047 --> 35:33.466
- Tell us about
your savory main dish.

35:33.508 --> 35:35.677
- So our savory main dish
is a fusion

35:35.719 --> 35:37.554
between Indian and Mexican.

35:37.595 --> 35:41.099
So we made
Indo-Mexican spicy eggs.

35:41.141 --> 35:44.436
And that seasoning is inspired
by Indian flavors

35:44.477 --> 35:46.604
and it has shredded
Mexican cheese

35:46.646 --> 35:49.107
as well as Indian cheese,
which is the paneer.

35:49.149 --> 35:54.070
Some onions, garlic, tomatoes,
black beans, and eggs.

35:54.112 --> 35:57.365
- First of all,
it's a flavor bomb in my mouth.

35:57.407 --> 35:59.075
The fusion, that's wonderful.

35:59.117 --> 36:01.578
I really loved the cheese,
it's melty.

36:01.619 --> 36:03.788
The egg is not overcooked.
- Wow.

36:03.830 --> 36:07.000
- The Mexican spices and
the Indian spices come through.

36:07.042 --> 36:10.837
And this would be good for
brunch on a really chilly day.

36:10.879 --> 36:12.464
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

36:12.505 --> 36:17.385
- I find it very spicy.
But I appreciate your cilantro.

36:17.427 --> 36:19.888
Because it toned
down the jalapeno.

36:19.929 --> 36:22.557
- Okay.
- But very good. Very good.

36:22.599 --> 36:24.309
- Thank you.
- And I like the eggs.

36:24.351 --> 36:27.062
The eggs around it, ooh!

36:27.103 --> 36:29.356
- Let's get some dessert.

36:29.397 --> 36:33.610
- For our dessert, we have
gajar halwa cinnamon buns.

36:33.651 --> 36:35.528
Gajar halwa is carrot pudding

36:35.570 --> 36:37.781
that we made back home
and we really--

36:37.822 --> 36:39.949
That's our favorite
dessert as well.

36:39.991 --> 36:43.078
- So we thought of using that
in our cinnamon buns

36:43.119 --> 36:46.748
along with the cinnamon sugar
spice.

36:46.790 --> 36:49.542
- It's so beautiful.
- Your dough is like a pillow.

36:49.584 --> 36:51.294
- It is, yeah.
- It's a cloud.

36:51.336 --> 36:52.796
It's so light.

36:52.837 --> 36:54.756
- It really is. It's so good.

36:54.798 --> 36:59.636
Sweet. Not dense.
The flavors are very subtle.

36:59.678 --> 37:02.097
And I think for breakfast
sometimes that's best.

37:02.138 --> 37:03.807
- I thought the bake
was beautiful.

37:03.848 --> 37:06.267
Thank you.
- Your dough was lovely

37:06.309 --> 37:07.811
and it was soft and pillowy

37:07.852 --> 37:09.479
and your crumb was perfect.

37:09.521 --> 37:11.398
- Niyati and Abhi,

37:11.439 --> 37:16.736
this is a wonderful holiday
brunch in this cabin.

37:16.778 --> 37:18.363
- Thank you.
<i>- The overall goal</i>

37:18.405 --> 37:19.989
was obviously to have fun,

37:20.031 --> 37:22.117
<i>but while doing so,
also, like, present</i>

37:22.158 --> 37:24.327
the kind of flavors
which we grew up with.

37:24.369 --> 37:27.122
- One more for the road.
<i>- We've achieved that.</i>

37:27.163 --> 37:29.374
- We're just proud
of the accomplishments.

37:29.416 --> 37:30.583
- Good job.

37:30.625 --> 37:32.585
- You all did such
an awesome job.

37:32.627 --> 37:35.338
You're not gonna make
our job any easier.

37:35.380 --> 37:36.840
I mean, it's gonna be hard

37:36.881 --> 37:39.342
because you all
are such great bakers.

37:39.384 --> 37:41.011
- I was really blown away.

37:41.052 --> 37:44.514
And it's so interesting how
different each one of them was.

37:44.556 --> 37:46.141
The take on the idea of brunch.

37:46.182 --> 37:48.852
- They're all incredible.
I don't envy you guys.

37:48.893 --> 37:51.396
- Cheers to all you bakers!
- Cheers, bakers!-

37:51.438 --> 37:52.605
- Cheers!
- Great job!

37:52.647 --> 37:53.857
- Cheers!
- Great, great job!

37:53.898 --> 37:55.692
- Great job!
- The fabulous finals.

37:55.734 --> 37:57.402
- Fabulous.

37:58.111 --> 37:59.738
- I'll tell you what,
I do not envy the Grannies

37:59.779 --> 38:00.989
going into this final.
- Nope.

38:01.031 --> 38:02.198
They do all the hard stuff.

38:02.240 --> 38:05.660
We just eat,
they do the heavy lifting.

38:05.702 --> 38:07.120
- Honestly, we're just
so relaxed

38:07.162 --> 38:08.329
'cause of the robes.

38:08.371 --> 38:10.582
We don't care who wins.
We love everybody.

38:12.250 --> 38:15.462
- Food brings people together
and just like the holidays,

38:15.503 --> 38:16.921
it's the people
you're with

38:16.963 --> 38:19.591
that make the moments
you share so special.

38:19.632 --> 38:23.261
We are so happy that we got to
have this time with all of you.

38:23.303 --> 38:24.679
- And the food
was pretty good, too.

38:24.721 --> 38:26.056
- Mm-hmm.

38:26.097 --> 38:28.892
But, unfortunately,
there can only be one winner.

38:28.933 --> 38:31.353
- We're gathered here
around the Christmas tree

38:31.394 --> 38:33.938
for our lighting ceremony.

38:33.980 --> 38:36.691
- Each of your names
is in the branches.

38:36.733 --> 38:38.526
- When we light the tree
for the first time,

38:38.568 --> 38:41.738
the names of the very
first winners of "Baking It"

38:41.780 --> 38:44.366
will light up
for everyone to see.

38:44.407 --> 38:47.911
- Thus shall the names of
the Master Bakers be revealed

38:47.952 --> 38:52.582
and their master baking
will be cheered the world over!

38:52.624 --> 38:54.501
- You mean Best in Dough.
- I do not.

38:54.542 --> 38:57.420
But whatever you call them,

38:57.462 --> 38:59.589
our first ever winners

38:59.631 --> 39:03.468
will take home
the $50,000 prize.

39:03.510 --> 39:07.597
- So, bakers,

39:07.639 --> 39:10.016
are you ready
for the tree lighting?

39:10.058 --> 39:12.560
We're ready.
- Yeah.

39:12.602 --> 39:15.480
- Being in this competition
has been like gaining

39:15.522 --> 39:16.856
new family members

39:16.898 --> 39:19.359
and they're some
of my new favorite people.

39:19.401 --> 39:21.444
- Ditto, 100%.

39:21.486 --> 39:23.947
<i>- No matter what happens,
I'm gonna end this experience</i>

39:23.988 --> 39:26.408
really proud of you.
- And you.

39:26.449 --> 39:29.285
<i>- And really proud of what
we were able to do together.</i>

39:29.327 --> 39:32.080
<i>- We win or we lose,
we're already winners.</i>

39:32.122 --> 39:34.416
- This has been truly a really
enriching experience,

39:34.457 --> 39:36.668
something which we'll never
forget, ever in our lives.

39:36.710 --> 39:38.461
<i>- Yeah.</i>

39:38.503 --> 39:41.756
<i>- We are really humbled going
against these amazing bakers.</i>

39:41.798 --> 39:43.967
We'll cherish this forever.

39:44.009 --> 39:45.593
<i>- All of our foods tasted good,</i>

39:45.635 --> 39:48.388
we've put out some things
that we were excited about,

39:48.430 --> 39:50.890
we put out some things
that we would've changed,

39:50.932 --> 39:52.308
but I think that
the overall experience

39:52.350 --> 39:54.269
of what we were able
to do in the kitchen,

39:54.310 --> 39:56.271
I don't think
I would change a whole lot.

39:56.312 --> 39:58.356
- I'm super proud of you,
and I love you so much.

39:58.398 --> 40:00.734
- I love you, too.

40:00.775 --> 40:03.903
- All right, here we go.

40:03.945 --> 40:06.489
It's Christmas Day.

40:06.531 --> 40:07.824
- Brunch is over.

40:07.866 --> 40:10.577
- So let us get lit.

40:10.618 --> 40:12.620
- Noice.

40:12.662 --> 40:13.830
- God, this is exciting.

41:19.145 --> 41:21.481

41:24.818 --> 41:26.569
We're Best in Dough!

41:26.611 --> 41:29.030
- Aw!

41:31.324 --> 41:34.703
Oh, my gosh, thank you so much
for this opportunity.

41:34.744 --> 41:36.079
I honestly didn't know

41:36.121 --> 41:38.081
what to expect
coming into this experience.

41:38.123 --> 41:39.958
I thought it was going
to be about baking,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.127
but it was really about
getting to know people,

41:42.168 --> 41:43.712
and food is something
that we all share,

41:43.753 --> 41:47.632
and it's a way to get to know
the people around us

41:47.674 --> 41:49.968
and to share part of ourselves
with other people.

41:50.010 --> 41:52.095
And that's really
a beautiful thing.

41:52.137 --> 41:54.347
- That's sharing love
on a plate.

41:54.389 --> 41:55.765
- That's well said.

41:55.807 --> 41:57.809
- Listen, bakers,
I want to thank each

41:57.851 --> 41:59.936
and every one of you all.

41:59.978 --> 42:03.106
You are truly top bakers.

42:03.148 --> 42:05.525
And I just have
one little life lesson.

42:05.567 --> 42:08.278

42:08.319 --> 42:10.780
the gifts and material things.
