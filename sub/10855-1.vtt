00:16.980 --> 00:18.389
Have you got a fire extinguisher?

00:18.390 --> 00:20.199
-A f...?
-For putting out fires.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.959
I've got one in the car,
but I may need something bigger.

00:21.960 --> 00:24.519
There's a fella round the corner
reckoning to set fire to himself!

00:24.520 --> 00:26.940
Thank you, we're on top of that.
How much for these?

00:30.870 --> 00:32.829
Nice glasses.

00:32.830 --> 00:35.439
Well, he can send himself to
paradise - that's his choice -

00:35.440 --> 00:38.709
but he's not
taking my eyebrows with him.

00:38.710 --> 00:41.629
Oh, what, you think
I give a toss about what you do?

00:41.630 --> 00:44.119
You're just bloody scum,
you're like pigs, like animals!

00:44.120 --> 00:46.159
-Do we know his name?
-Liam Hughes.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.439
23.
Unemployed. Smackhead.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.779
-What's he upset about?
-His ex.

00:50.780 --> 00:53.579
-His ex.
-She finished with him three days ago,

00:53.580 --> 00:55.930
now she's sleeping
with his best bud.

00:56.310 --> 00:58.419
We've got a high-ranking
highly trained

00:58.420 --> 01:01.579
specialist expert police negotiator
on his way over from Wakefield.

01:01.580 --> 01:03.029
ETA?

01:03.030 --> 01:05.760
Basically it's you and me, kid.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.239
Go and close down the comedy
department.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.149
The one and only...
human barbecue!

01:11.150 --> 01:13.719
You come any closer and
I'm setting meself off, all right!

01:13.720 --> 01:15.029
What's happened, Liam?

01:15.030 --> 01:16.439
I don't know why
you've brought that.

01:16.440 --> 01:18.349
If you accidentally
fireball yourself...

01:18.350 --> 01:21.200
You're going to get foamed,
and believe you me,
it's not a good look.

01:23.770 --> 01:25.699
How's it all come to this then, lad?

01:25.700 --> 01:27.359
I've been humiliated.

01:27.360 --> 01:28.709
Humiliated?

01:28.710 --> 01:31.620
I don't want to talk about it
all right? OK.

01:32.850 --> 01:35.719
You know, actions speak
louder than words.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.270
OK. Can I just say this though,
Liam?

01:38.580 --> 01:40.889
The lighter's making me nervous.

01:40.890 --> 01:43.129
You've had a lot to drink
and you've got the shakes

01:43.130 --> 01:45.859
and you might press it without intending
to, and I'd like you to put it down.

01:45.860 --> 01:47.469
Leave me alone,
you stupid bitch.

01:47.470 --> 01:48.909
You're upset,
I understand that.

01:48.910 --> 01:51.389
The point I'm making is
that with all these fumes...

01:51.390 --> 01:53.199
frankly, I don't know how
you're staying conscious -

01:53.200 --> 01:55.489
you could go up any second
whether you intend to or not,

01:55.490 --> 01:57.819
and once you go up,
you won't just go up a bit,

01:57.820 --> 02:00.999
you'll go up a lot, and the
other big thing to say is, it hurts.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.549
Three seconds in
and you'll be screaming at me

02:03.550 --> 02:06.259
seven seconds in and you'll
be begging me to shoot you.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.219
<i>I've a negotiator
on his way to you,</i>

02:08.220 --> 02:10.579
<i>-but he's stuck in traffic.</i>
-OK.

02:10.580 --> 02:13.970
<i>He says the big thing is to keep the
subject engaged in conversation.</i>

02:14.380 --> 02:16.189
Yeah, I think we've got that
covered.

02:16.190 --> 02:17.769
I'm Catherine, by the way.

02:17.770 --> 02:20.589
I'm 47, I'm divorced,
I live with my sister

02:20.590 --> 02:22.549
who's a recovering
heroin addict.

02:22.550 --> 02:24.269
I have two grown-up children.
One dead,

02:24.270 --> 02:26.680
one who doesn't speak to me,
and a grandson. So...

02:27.780 --> 02:30.439
Why? Why doesn't he speak to you?

02:30.440 --> 02:32.710
It's complicated.
Let's talk about you.

03:10.330 --> 03:12.059
Nevison'll see you now, Kevin.

03:12.060 --> 03:13.360
Terrific.
Thank you.

03:17.250 --> 03:19.059
-Kevin.
-Nevison.

03:19.060 --> 03:21.739
-What's up?
-Nothing. Nothing's up.

03:21.740 --> 03:25.370
As such. I...
Can I...?

03:32.030 --> 03:33.330
Can I...?

03:34.650 --> 03:36.650
The thing is...
OK...

03:37.530 --> 03:38.830
Melissa.

03:39.430 --> 03:41.239
-Melissa.
-My eldest.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.060
I know who Melissa is, Kevin.

03:43.430 --> 03:46.070
She's very bright,
she's very clever.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.919
We tried to get her
in at Salter Hebble High,

03:48.920 --> 03:50.670
but it's outside
the catchment area.

03:50.990 --> 03:52.379
The thing is...

03:52.380 --> 03:55.069
we - Jenny - it was Jenny's idea.

03:55.070 --> 03:59.279
She - Melissa - sat the entrance
exam to St Bartholomew's.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.619
They've offered her a place.
But not a scholarship.

04:02.620 --> 04:04.680
There's a lot of competition.

04:05.210 --> 04:08.029
We'd like to be able to send her
there, obviously,

04:08.030 --> 04:09.750
but the thing is...

04:11.760 --> 04:13.660
I'd need a pay rise.

04:14.430 --> 04:17.539
If we can't send her there
she'll have to go to Wellesley Hill,

04:17.540 --> 04:21.279
which - you know...
it does its best, but...

04:22.490 --> 04:25.670
This is a great opportunity for her
at St Bartholomew's.

04:26.180 --> 04:29.489
-I don't pay you peanuts, Kevin.
-No, Nevison, I know that.

04:29.490 --> 04:30.950
How much is it?

04:31.700 --> 04:35.620
-Â£9,800 a year.
-9,800. What about Catriona?

04:36.320 --> 04:39.089
-Yeah, but she's not daft, is she?
-Catriona's eight.

04:39.090 --> 04:41.010
You can't send one
and not the other.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.059
Well, we'll cross that bridge
when we get there.

04:44.060 --> 04:47.549
19,600 a year for five years,
most likely seven.

04:47.550 --> 04:51.049
-That's just shy of Â£140,000.
-137,200.

04:51.050 --> 04:53.419
Wellesley Hill's not a bad school,
Kevin.

04:53.420 --> 04:54.959
-I'm not saying it is...
-A clever kid

04:54.960 --> 04:57.069
will do well wherever they go.
Look at me!

04:57.070 --> 05:00.329
That's... you're a great example
to all of us,

05:00.330 --> 05:02.539
-of course, Nevison. That's...
-The thing is,

05:02.540 --> 05:06.329
I've got 115 permanent
staff working here, Kevin.

05:06.330 --> 05:08.119
I know how many people work here,
Nevison.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.429
I do their wages.

05:09.430 --> 05:10.889
If they all asked for a rise

05:10.890 --> 05:13.079
so they could send their
kids to St Bartholomew's

05:13.080 --> 05:14.979
I'd struggle to
make a profit, wouldn't I?

05:14.980 --> 05:16.699
I didn't necessarily
mean the whole amount...

05:16.700 --> 05:18.390
I'll tell you what I'm going to do,
Kevin.

05:19.860 --> 05:21.670
I'm going to think about it.

05:29.210 --> 05:31.370
-Catherine!
-Hello!

05:31.780 --> 05:33.339
Hello. I thought I might catch you.

05:33.340 --> 05:36.429
Do you know anything about this man that
tried to set fire to himself this morning?

05:36.430 --> 05:37.739
Yes, he didn't.

05:37.740 --> 05:39.279
No, I mean the one who
was threatening to.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.379
An incident occurred and it was
dealt with swiftly and efficiently

05:41.380 --> 05:43.989
-by community police officers.
-It's not engaging copy.

05:43.990 --> 05:45.709
It really wasn't that exciting.

05:45.710 --> 05:49.079
-Are you doing anything this evening?
-Telly.

05:49.080 --> 05:53.190
You wouldn't
like to go out for something to eat?

05:53.550 --> 05:55.180
I'm losing my job.

05:56.150 --> 05:59.059
We all are.
Because The Gazette's closing down.

05:59.060 --> 06:00.369
You're kidding.

06:00.370 --> 06:02.179
128 years in print and now it's...

06:02.180 --> 06:04.839
Well, it's not closing down,
it's all going online.

06:04.840 --> 06:08.039
God, Richard, I'm really sorry.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.890
They're announcing it
officially tomorrow.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.480
I've got four weeks left.

06:13.770 --> 06:16.999
Look, I've got to go,
I've got to pick Ryan up.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.429
I assume you know.

06:18.430 --> 06:21.630
But I only heard this morning,
I was covering something at court.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.480
Tommy Lee Royce's been released.

06:27.590 --> 06:29.130
Did you know?

06:30.870 --> 06:32.170
No.

06:34.050 --> 06:38.879
I mean, I knew it'd be around now,
but...

06:38.880 --> 06:42.020
Apparently...
he's out.

06:59.910 --> 07:01.690
-Oi!
-Catherine!

07:02.570 --> 07:06.500
Hello! Sorry, you haven't
got five minutes, have you?

07:07.260 --> 07:08.560
Ryan!

07:11.750 --> 07:15.650
You're such a nice little boy, Ryan.
Most of the time.

07:16.570 --> 07:20.620
But then you let this unpleasant
temper get the better of you.

07:21.590 --> 07:23.759
And I understand you get frustrated,
but...

07:23.760 --> 07:26.470
but you've got to find better
ways of dealing with it.

07:27.810 --> 07:30.699
Did he...
hurt anyone?

07:30.700 --> 07:33.850
Well, no, he hurt himself.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.739
Nobody else got hurt,
but the point is, Ryan,

07:36.740 --> 07:38.049
they could've done.

07:38.050 --> 07:40.890
When you start throwing
chairs across the room

07:41.210 --> 07:43.500
and using unacceptable language...

07:44.220 --> 07:48.380
and, you see, we do have a responsibility
to protect the other children.

07:56.010 --> 07:57.319
I'm watching telly.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.530
Can you get changed first, please?

07:59.870 --> 08:02.119
-Why?
-Cos I said so.

08:02.120 --> 08:03.879
Can I have some juice, then?

08:03.880 --> 08:05.609
-Need you ask?
-No,

08:05.610 --> 08:08.190
-I mean are you getting it me?
-Get changed.

08:11.150 --> 08:13.709
Lad down Sowerby Bridge set fire to
himself this morning.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.269
-No, he didn't.
-Apparently.

08:15.270 --> 08:16.650
Woman in the shop said.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.080
Do you want these?

08:19.570 --> 08:20.870
Oh, ta.

08:21.550 --> 08:22.859
You been busy?

08:22.860 --> 08:25.309
I've been up the allotment all
afternoon, I've only just got back.

08:25.310 --> 08:26.880
There's some tea in the pot.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.049
I saw Richard.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.549
He asked me out for a meal tonight,
is that all right?

08:31.550 --> 08:33.289
-Can you see to Ryan?
-Sure.

08:34.049 --> 08:37.899
That's a bit mad. Isn't it?
A date with your ex-husband.

08:37.900 --> 08:40.450
Won't the new younger model have
something to say?

08:43.090 --> 08:45.209
He's been in bother again.

08:45.210 --> 08:47.069
He chucked a chair
across the classroom

08:47.070 --> 08:49.070
and told Mrs. Mukherjee to eff off.

08:51.790 --> 08:53.950
Do you sometimes think
they over-react?

08:56.150 --> 08:58.250
Tommy Lee Royce is out of prison.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.910
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, I heard.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.500
Why didn't you tell me?

09:07.650 --> 09:09.500
I didn't want to upset you.

09:18.030 --> 09:19.549
You did your best.

09:19.550 --> 09:21.190
Well, it wasn't good enough.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.660
It doesn't matter.

09:24.020 --> 09:25.329
It matters.

09:25.330 --> 09:28.690
-At least he thought about it.
-And then he said no.

09:31.410 --> 09:34.190
-It was always going to be unlikely.
-I'm not just anyone.

09:36.110 --> 09:37.930
Jesus Christ!

09:40.310 --> 09:43.770
No.
No, and he knows that.

09:44.280 --> 09:47.749
Does he? Does he?
How does he know that?

09:47.750 --> 09:49.999
What does he do that shows
he knows that?

09:50.000 --> 09:53.800
You tell me one tiny thing he ever
does that shows me he knows that.

09:54.910 --> 09:57.859
It isn't like Kevin's just anyone,
though, is it?

09:57.860 --> 09:59.450
Of course he isn't.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.219
And I did think about it.

10:02.220 --> 10:04.059
Which is more than I would have
done for anyone else.

10:04.060 --> 10:06.080
Anyone else,
I'd have said "on your bike".

10:06.890 --> 10:08.759
The fact I've mentioned it to you

10:08.760 --> 10:10.789
shows it's not a decision
I've taken lightly.

10:10.790 --> 10:12.819
Doesn't it?
Eh?

10:12.820 --> 10:14.449
You're not looking at me.

10:14.450 --> 10:16.749
You don't think I'm going to agree
with anything you say, do you?

10:16.750 --> 10:18.849
How much did we spend
on her education?

10:18.850 --> 10:22.349
-Let's not go down that route again.
-And what good did that do?

10:22.350 --> 10:25.170
I might as well have pissed it all
up against a wall.

10:26.980 --> 10:30.370
Yeah, go on, and slam the door!

10:35.770 --> 10:37.800
That was unnecessary.

10:40.970 --> 10:44.929
I'm a nice fella, Helen.
And I'm a good boss.

10:44.930 --> 10:47.859
I can't do for one what
I can't do for everybody.

10:47.860 --> 10:49.870
Even if it is Kevin.

10:52.450 --> 10:53.970
Have you...

10:55.650 --> 10:57.790
had an OK day, love?

11:04.730 --> 11:06.789
I don't know what it is
she doesn't get.

11:06.790 --> 11:09.209
You don't move house when you've
just lost your job, do you?

11:09.210 --> 11:12.090
-You'd get it.
-Yeah, well, you know.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.409
-You married her.
-She goes,

11:14.410 --> 11:17.249
"Oh, something'll crop up",
and I'm like,

11:17.250 --> 11:20.550
"Well, what, I'm nearly 50, I'm not
trained for anything else".

11:21.220 --> 11:24.080
No.
Well...

11:24.490 --> 11:27.819
Speaking of which, what was the
story this morning with that fella?

11:27.820 --> 11:29.120
Richard...

11:30.590 --> 11:32.579
It was a domestic.

11:32.580 --> 11:34.869
He was off his head on booze,
he was off his head on skunk.

11:34.870 --> 11:36.920
His girlfriend had dumped him,
that's...

11:37.950 --> 11:40.709
it's the usual everyday
story of country folk.

11:40.710 --> 11:42.210
Where did they take him?

11:43.020 --> 11:44.569
Where did who take him?

11:44.570 --> 11:47.600
The paramedics.
I assume there were paramedics...

11:48.010 --> 11:51.679
I don't know, I didn't ask.
Out of sight, out of mind.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.389
How did you talk him down?

11:53.390 --> 11:54.920
I didn't.
I tried to.

11:55.630 --> 11:57.589
But then he got his cigarettes out.

11:57.590 --> 12:00.699
He hadn't made the connection
that trying to light one of
his petrol-soaked cigarettes

12:00.700 --> 12:03.430
would involve clicking his lighter,
so I foamed him.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.059
What was his name?

12:06.060 --> 12:07.360
I'm not...!

12:12.350 --> 12:14.309
Do you want to know
what you should do next?

12:14.310 --> 12:15.619
How about this?

12:15.620 --> 12:18.009
Instead of trying to dish
the dirt on one poor, misguided,

12:18.010 --> 12:19.829
misinformed numpty,
you write a big article.

12:19.830 --> 12:21.429
Something you can sell
to one of the nationals

12:21.430 --> 12:23.539
about why so much of
it goes on round here.

12:23.540 --> 12:28.120
-So much...?
-Drugs! Wasted lives!

12:28.430 --> 12:31.309
This valley is awash with every kind
of crap you can get your hands on.

12:31.310 --> 12:32.610
There's your story.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.059
And you want to
know where they took him?

12:35.060 --> 12:36.739
They probably took him to the
psychiatric unit

12:36.740 --> 12:38.049
when in fact
All he needed

12:38.050 --> 12:40.159
was a brief controlled
demonstration of how petrol

12:40.160 --> 12:41.669
behaves when you put it anywhere
near a naked flame,

12:41.670 --> 12:44.070
because he had no idea how
bad it would be.

12:46.020 --> 12:47.770
Where's Tommy Lee Royce living?

12:48.180 --> 12:49.920
I've no idea.

12:52.450 --> 12:54.520
-Is he living round here?
-Catherine...

12:55.280 --> 12:58.229
you know as much as me.
More, probably.

12:58.230 --> 13:00.599
Hasn't he got a release address?

13:00.600 --> 13:01.909
Yeah, his mother's.

13:01.910 --> 13:04.609
I went back to the nick
and rang probation.

13:04.610 --> 13:07.810
She lives in a terraced house
on Rishworth, but he won't be there.

13:21.330 --> 13:22.630
Thanks.

13:23.295 --> 13:24.595
Pleasure.

13:39.410 --> 13:41.210
What time's she
expecting you back...

13:42.020 --> 13:43.320
from Rotherham?

13:44.060 --> 13:45.360
Midnight?

13:52.890 --> 13:56.240
You'll have to come inside. I'm too
old to start shagging in cars.

14:00.050 --> 14:02.150
We have no luck.

14:03.090 --> 14:07.550
We have a nice house.
We have two fantastic children.

14:08.580 --> 14:11.189
Huh. Nevison says people
make their own luck.

14:11.190 --> 14:13.739
Well, maybe that's
easy for Nevison to say.

14:13.740 --> 14:15.650
It's a stupid thing to say.

14:16.450 --> 14:19.694
It isn't like anyone sets out to
be unlucky, is it?

14:19.695 --> 14:22.530
We all take opportunities if we can.

14:22.940 --> 14:24.650
If we see them.

14:26.590 --> 14:30.750
I think we do very well.
All things considered.

14:32.090 --> 14:35.390
All things considered?
What does that mean?

14:36.110 --> 14:38.049
Nothing.
I just meant...

14:38.050 --> 14:40.790
Given how little and dull
and ordinary we are.

14:48.970 --> 14:51.420
Half that company
should be mine, Jenny.

14:53.080 --> 14:57.209
And instead, every day I
have to go in there, smiling,

14:57.210 --> 14:59.909
then bend over
and take it up the arse.

14:59.910 --> 15:02.350
I'm sorry but that's how it feels.

15:03.650 --> 15:05.159
Day after day,

15:05.160 --> 15:06.580
week after week,

15:07.290 --> 15:09.730
month after month.
Year after year.

15:42.350 --> 15:45.250
There's pens left on this grave,
Granny!

16:34.590 --> 16:36.769
-Ashley!
-Kevin.

16:36.770 --> 16:38.390
-Jenny.
-Hi.

16:39.020 --> 16:40.759
-Ladies!
-Hi, Ashley.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.329
-Hiya.
-I've got a cheque for you.

16:42.330 --> 16:44.419
-No rush.
-I'll pop down later.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.179
Any time. You know me,
I'm not going anywhere.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.659
I've sorted you out
your access, Jenny.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.719
Wheelchair access
to the games room,

16:51.720 --> 16:53.609
if you fancy playing table tennis.

16:53.610 --> 16:54.910
Ashley!

16:55.970 --> 16:58.339
You can play table tennis,
can't you? You're not...

16:58.340 --> 17:00.379
I can. I love a game of table
tennis.

17:00.380 --> 17:02.690
Good, well, it's all ready for you,
then.

17:03.350 --> 17:06.659
Our Ben and our Sam are about if
you're short of someone to play with.

17:06.660 --> 17:09.559
-Yeah! Can we get out, Dad?
-Sure.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.239
-Bye, Mum! Bye, Dad!
-Bye!

17:11.240 --> 17:12.930
Enjoy your weekend!

17:15.810 --> 17:19.220
Take him. Ashley. Prime example.

17:20.010 --> 17:22.169
-Of what?
-What I'm talking about!

17:22.170 --> 17:25.490
You seen them cars?
Brand-new. 80-odd thousand.

17:26.095 --> 17:29.310
All that from holiday caravan
rentals.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.590
I'm in the wrong game
altogether.

17:32.950 --> 17:36.850
I'm in the wrong God knows...
Everything.

17:50.350 --> 17:51.849
Yes!

17:51.850 --> 17:54.160
Was that Richard I heard last night?

17:55.410 --> 17:58.579
We didn't do anything we haven't
done a thousand times before.

17:58.580 --> 18:00.500
I'm not judging anybody.

18:01.390 --> 18:03.890
I felt sorry for him.
Losing his job.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.710
And she just goes on at him
apparently, and...

18:08.830 --> 18:10.130
What?

18:11.690 --> 18:13.329
I get lonely.

18:13.330 --> 18:14.879
I didn't want Tommy Lee Royce

18:14.880 --> 18:17.730
buzzing round in my head
all night, I wanted something else.

18:18.870 --> 18:20.875
-Did it work?
-No.

18:22.650 --> 18:26.309
He might not even be living round
here any more, he might've...

18:26.310 --> 18:27.619
Clare.

18:27.620 --> 18:30.729
He's the sort that thinks
Manchester is abroad.

18:30.730 --> 18:32.990
It wouldn't occur to him
to go anywhere else.

18:33.530 --> 18:36.060
He wouldn't know how to be
anywhere else.

18:36.630 --> 18:38.390
He's like a rat.

18:39.310 --> 18:41.650
He'll never be more
than three feet away.

18:55.610 --> 18:57.809
Dad! Dad! Dad!

18:57.810 --> 19:00.340
There's a red kite!
Dad!

19:01.030 --> 19:04.339
Beautiful! Lovely!

19:04.340 --> 19:06.450
-Look at that lads, eh?
-Ashley.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.879
475.
Was that the right amount?

19:10.880 --> 19:12.240
Spot on, Kevin.

19:14.050 --> 19:15.350
Shit.

19:20.410 --> 19:21.710
That's...

19:25.530 --> 19:27.959
What do you suppose that is, lads?

19:27.960 --> 19:30.659
Search me, boss.
No idea.

19:30.660 --> 19:32.450
Never seen owt like it.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.850
Maybe you should ring the police.

19:39.450 --> 19:42.979
Yeah. Yeah we should.
You're right.

19:42.980 --> 19:44.280
I'll...

19:46.150 --> 19:48.220
Can I just have a word with you,
Kevin,

19:48.770 --> 19:51.559
regarding your next season's
rental on t'caravan?

19:51.560 --> 19:53.939
There's a few bits and bobs I need to
go through with you.

19:53.940 --> 19:55.859
Could...
we do that later?

19:55.860 --> 19:58.810
I said I'd help Jenny unload
the shopping, she's...

19:59.820 --> 20:01.210
Would you like a beer?

20:01.820 --> 20:04.549
No, no, I...

20:04.550 --> 20:07.059
-Come on, have a beer.
-I don't need a beer.

20:07.060 --> 20:09.629
What's the matter?
I'm just offering you a beer.

20:09.630 --> 20:11.250
Go and have a beer, Kevin.

20:14.550 --> 20:15.850
Listen.

20:17.690 --> 20:19.920
You don't need to worry. About me.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.019
I haven't seen anything.

20:22.020 --> 20:23.430
Well, I can see it.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.659
-It's cannabis!
-No, I mean...

20:25.660 --> 20:27.369
I mean I don't know why
there's bags of camel shit

20:27.370 --> 20:29.500
in my bags of sand,
but why?

20:30.010 --> 20:31.549
Are you accusing me
of something?

20:31.550 --> 20:33.609
I don't want any trouble, Ashley.

20:33.610 --> 20:36.279
I just want to go back to Jenny
and the caravan and...

20:36.280 --> 20:38.429
I'm not happy making threats, Kevin.

20:38.430 --> 20:41.209
I like Jenny, I'm fond of the girls,

20:41.210 --> 20:43.209
but if you're accusing me of
something,

20:43.210 --> 20:44.949
that's a very serious business.

20:44.950 --> 20:48.050
Ashley. Ashley. This is...

20:55.750 --> 20:57.490
You can trust me.

20:58.430 --> 21:00.229
Believe me. I think people have to
make money

21:00.230 --> 21:04.399
the best way they know how,
and yes, actually, yeah.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.350
I would like a beer.

21:16.490 --> 21:17.790
Knob.

21:27.790 --> 21:30.149
How would you like to make
half a million pounds?

21:30.150 --> 21:31.459
Sorry?

21:31.460 --> 21:33.169
It's not something I could do
on my own.

21:33.170 --> 21:35.569
I've thought it through, I've
thought through most of the details.

21:35.570 --> 21:38.430
But I would need help.

21:39.540 --> 21:42.080
Well, I'm listening.

21:44.210 --> 21:47.310
Nevison Gallagher.
Has a daughter.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.389
Ann.

21:49.390 --> 21:51.989
Nevison could afford to lose
half a million pounds, easily.

21:51.990 --> 21:53.579
Any more,
he might go to the police.

21:53.580 --> 21:56.229
It'd take a good few days -
probably a week -

21:56.230 --> 21:58.169
to let him get that
kind of money together,

21:58.170 --> 22:01.120
in cash, without arousing
suspicion at the bank.

22:01.550 --> 22:06.209
And I don't know where we - you -
would keep her.

22:06.210 --> 22:08.969
As I say there's elements I haven't
thought through yet,

22:08.970 --> 22:10.970
-but the basic...
-You're talking about...

22:12.230 --> 22:13.750
Kidnapping her?!

22:14.950 --> 22:17.769
She's just finished college,
she hasn't got a job.

22:17.770 --> 22:20.670
No-one apart from them would miss
her. Just for a few days.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.890
That's all it would take.

22:25.670 --> 22:27.420
I thought you liked old Nev.

22:28.890 --> 22:30.190
No.

22:31.290 --> 22:33.880
No, Ashley. I don't like old Nev.

22:34.550 --> 22:36.759
Did you know, him and my dad were
best friends?

22:36.760 --> 22:39.599
At school.
They grew up on the same street.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.909
They cooked the idea up together,

22:40.910 --> 22:43.010
they kicked the whole thing off
together.

22:43.450 --> 22:46.980
Then my dad went off to college
to train to be an accountant

22:48.140 --> 22:51.380
and when he came back.
Nevison offered him a job.

22:52.850 --> 22:54.570
They were partners!

22:55.750 --> 22:58.059
And somehow Nevison
side-stepped that,

22:58.060 --> 22:59.950
like he does side-step things.

23:00.390 --> 23:02.200
He'd got the lawyers in.

23:02.610 --> 23:06.770
And my dad - being my dad -
well, he just accepted it.

23:12.210 --> 23:13.950
Can I think about it?

23:15.570 --> 23:18.419
That's what Nevison said,
when I asked him for a rise,

23:18.420 --> 23:20.679
so I could get
Melissa into a better school.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.370
He thought about it

23:23.970 --> 23:25.600
and then he said no.

23:43.550 --> 23:45.110
What did you say?

23:46.770 --> 23:48.479
He's sorted, he's fine,

23:48.480 --> 23:49.889
he's chicken shit,

23:49.890 --> 23:52.109
nobody needs to worry about him.

23:52.110 --> 23:54.170
I'm not happy wi' this new fella.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.749
-He's fine.
-No, he's too quiet.

23:56.750 --> 23:59.299
-He comes recommended.
-He keeps looking at me funny!

23:59.300 --> 24:03.390
Give him a break. Been inside eight
years, he's only just got out.

24:06.490 --> 24:07.790
Get kettle on.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.979
There's summat
I want to talk through wi' you.

24:10.980 --> 24:12.280
Both of you.

24:17.130 --> 24:18.430
Tommy!

24:20.610 --> 24:22.200
Want a cup of tea?

24:32.870 --> 24:34.940
Granny, there's some flowers.

24:47.290 --> 24:48.590
Who they from?

24:52.310 --> 24:53.610
Richard.

24:54.790 --> 24:57.799
You're playing wi' fire there,
you know that, don't you?

24:57.800 --> 25:00.399
You going to read me a story, Gran?

25:00.400 --> 25:02.790
I just want five minutes
to myself.

25:03.730 --> 25:05.089
Have you got changed?

25:05.090 --> 25:07.559
I will have by the time you get
up here.

25:07.560 --> 25:09.250
What about running a bath?

25:11.050 --> 25:12.830
I'll bring you a cup of tea up.

25:26.210 --> 25:27.510
Tag!

25:36.930 --> 25:38.239
Dad?

25:38.240 --> 25:40.029
Ashley says have you got time
to pop over to the house

25:40.030 --> 25:42.080
for two minutes before we
head off home?

25:56.970 --> 25:58.509
OK.

25:58.510 --> 26:02.980
I need one or two more details
off you, but in principle, yeah.

26:03.460 --> 26:05.219
It's a departure,

26:05.220 --> 26:07.269
but me and Lewis
and Tommy are confident

26:07.270 --> 26:08.950
it's something we can handle.

26:09.350 --> 26:10.929
Well, that's...

26:10.930 --> 26:13.269
Obviously I've got overheads,

26:13.270 --> 26:15.179
so here's what I can offer you.

26:15.180 --> 26:16.750
10%.

26:17.610 --> 26:21.559
Ten?!
But... No, look, this is...

26:21.560 --> 26:23.729
We're talking 50 grand, Kevin.

26:23.730 --> 26:26.339
Enough to put the kiddie
through school, more or less.

26:26.340 --> 26:28.179
-It's what you wanted, isn't it?
-I want half!

26:28.180 --> 26:30.329
I can't justify half, Kevin!

26:30.330 --> 26:32.999
I'm the fella taking the risks here!
You're not.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.449
-I gave you information!
-You did, but the reality is,

26:36.450 --> 26:39.909
me and the lads could turn the whole
job round without you. Now.

26:39.910 --> 26:41.540
Couldn't we?
Eh?

26:42.150 --> 26:45.619
So, in fact, you're lucky I'm
offering you anything at all.

26:45.620 --> 26:47.929
You, you can't do that.
I could just...

26:47.930 --> 26:50.480
What?
What could you do?

26:51.070 --> 26:53.110
Tell the police about my sand?

26:53.990 --> 26:55.290
What sand?

26:58.470 --> 27:00.529
I don't want to fall out with you,
Kevin.

27:00.530 --> 27:02.799
I want you to put Melissa through
this nice school.

27:02.800 --> 27:06.190
It's what she deserves,
it's what you deserve.

27:07.100 --> 27:09.329
You'll be 50 grand better off,

27:09.330 --> 27:11.339
you won't even know
the thing's happened.

27:11.340 --> 27:14.210
A hundred.
A hundred grand.

27:15.220 --> 27:18.070
I want Catriona to be able to go,
too, when the time comes.

27:19.170 --> 27:20.470
Right.

27:21.610 --> 27:23.990
Fine.
Hundred.

27:26.230 --> 27:29.570
-When... when are you...?
-The less you know, Kev.

27:32.710 --> 27:36.690
You're a dark horse, you.
Aren't you? Eh?!

27:39.250 --> 27:41.490
-All right, lads?
-You all right?

27:48.130 --> 27:49.769
Fuck off!

27:49.770 --> 27:52.880
I think that means "Come in", Sarge,
in Swahili.

27:53.470 --> 27:56.100
-If I'd said that it'd be racist.
-Nah...

28:05.890 --> 28:07.409
Oi, oi.
Where's your warrant?

28:07.410 --> 28:09.259
I haven't got one,
I don't need one.

28:09.260 --> 28:10.569
Somebody rang three nines

28:10.570 --> 28:12.979
and said they'd heard screaming
coming from this flat.

28:12.980 --> 28:14.359
-That were me.
-Were her.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.669
He smacked me on t'head.

28:15.670 --> 28:17.839
-Were an accident.
-With the thing.

28:17.840 --> 28:20.609
-It were an accident.
-It were an accident.

28:20.610 --> 28:22.250
What's your name?

28:23.190 --> 28:24.949
You, lad, I'm talking to you.

28:24.950 --> 28:26.389
Jason Tindall.

28:26.390 --> 28:28.520
You can call me Tinner if y'want.

28:29.030 --> 28:31.139
Right, well, can you pull
that syringe

28:31.140 --> 28:32.670
out of your foot for me, please?

28:35.230 --> 28:37.059
Would you like to hear some jokes?

28:37.060 --> 28:39.629
Yeah, if you're confident
I can handle 'em.

28:39.630 --> 28:42.999
Liam Hughes is threatening to press
charges against me for assault.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.829
Assault by foam?
Yep, that's, yeah!

28:45.830 --> 28:47.730
That's good, that's funny.

28:48.440 --> 28:50.449
And, steady on, brace yourself.

28:50.450 --> 28:53.259
The newsagent I borrowed the fire
extinguisher off has invoiced me,

28:53.260 --> 28:56.459
personally, for Â£75.
To replace his fire extinguisher.

28:56.460 --> 28:58.219
The one he didn't even know he had!

28:58.220 --> 29:01.390
Nice! Nice one. I like them,
they're both good.

29:13.330 --> 29:15.759
Kevin. Hiya.
Nevison wants to see you.

29:15.760 --> 29:17.740
-What for?
-Dunno.

29:28.610 --> 29:30.700
Kevin. Come in,
sit down, shut door.

29:34.830 --> 29:36.850
-Is something wrong?
-No.

29:37.210 --> 29:40.089
Well.
We'll come onto that.

29:40.090 --> 29:43.789
The good news is,
I can't review your salary,

29:43.790 --> 29:46.839
not just at the minute,
but what I will do is,

29:46.840 --> 29:49.099
and I definitely don't want
this bandying about

29:49.100 --> 29:50.759
because I genuinely can't do
it for everyone,

29:50.760 --> 29:52.749
I will pay their school fees.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.360
Both of 'em.

29:55.650 --> 29:58.349
You've got Helen to thank, and Anne.

29:58.350 --> 30:01.110
One way and another. They've both
had a go at me.

30:02.070 --> 30:04.360
Ann.
Did she?

30:06.810 --> 30:08.110
So?

30:09.330 --> 30:10.800
Well, I...

30:11.750 --> 30:13.099
I don't know what to say.

30:13.100 --> 30:14.820
There was something else.

30:16.330 --> 30:17.909
I've been thinking about...

30:17.910 --> 30:19.539
not retiring,
I'd go mad,

30:19.540 --> 30:22.070
but taking a bit of time off.

30:26.630 --> 30:29.860
The thing is, you see, Helen's
been diagnosed with liver cancer.

30:31.300 --> 30:33.570
-Helen?
-Four months since.

30:33.980 --> 30:35.990
Prognosis isn't...

30:40.210 --> 30:43.659
Anyway.
Things she wants to do.

30:43.660 --> 30:46.890
Places we've visited over the years
that she wants to...

30:51.650 --> 30:52.950
So...

30:53.990 --> 30:59.150
The point is, I would like you
to deputise, for me.

31:00.190 --> 31:03.180
I know you think I take you
for granted sometimes, Kevin,

31:04.050 --> 31:05.350
but...

31:05.960 --> 31:09.119
Well, deputy managing director.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.650
Temporary.
Happen, happen not.

31:13.010 --> 31:14.950
Is that something you...

31:16.350 --> 31:19.690
..feel you could handle?

31:20.610 --> 31:23.070
In return for putting 'em
through this school?

31:24.810 --> 31:27.310
I...
I'm sorry.

31:28.250 --> 31:29.990
About Helen.

31:30.350 --> 31:31.650
Yeah. Yeah.

31:33.170 --> 31:36.330
It's shit. There's no other spin
you can put on it.

32:02.970 --> 32:05.690
See you!
Bye!

32:18.690 --> 32:20.250
Sorry, Catherine.

32:20.970 --> 32:22.990
You haven't got ten minutes
again, have you?

32:32.130 --> 32:35.279
We have someone -
an educational psychologist,

32:35.280 --> 32:37.659
who pops in once every three weeks,

32:37.660 --> 32:41.410
and I'd like to ask her
to spend some time with Ryan.

32:43.030 --> 32:46.470
He gets frustrated because
he struggles with his reading.

32:47.280 --> 32:49.139
I don't think it's rocket science.

32:49.140 --> 32:52.519
We can't keep letting him repeat
these sort of behaviour patterns

32:52.520 --> 32:54.859
and not explore what
the root cause might be.

32:54.860 --> 32:56.980
-No, I...
-You see...

32:57.810 --> 33:01.090
We have had comments
from other parents.

33:02.390 --> 33:06.550
It's simply a matter of
finding strategies. For him.

33:06.980 --> 33:09.169
To become more aware of
when he's getting angry,

33:09.170 --> 33:12.559
and how better he can deal with it,
in the moment.

33:12.560 --> 33:16.230
And then finding targets for him...

33:18.170 --> 33:21.480
It's not easy.
I know that.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.150
-Would you like some tea?
-No.

33:36.570 --> 33:38.730
Can I tell you something?

33:39.140 --> 33:40.440
Of course.

33:43.110 --> 33:47.299
Becky, my daughter, died
just after Ryan was born.

33:47.300 --> 33:49.990
Yeah, I think I knew that.

33:50.910 --> 33:52.660
He was six weeks old.

33:56.150 --> 33:57.569
She never really wanted him,

33:57.570 --> 34:01.109
but she couldn't do
anything about it in time

34:01.110 --> 34:04.309
because I didn't know
she was pregnant,

34:04.310 --> 34:07.859
and she refused to believe
that she was, I think.

34:07.860 --> 34:11.120
I think that's what was
going on in there, and...

34:11.730 --> 34:15.018
-Tell me if I'm boring you.
-You're not boring me.

34:15.020 --> 34:16.489
She was...

34:19.850 --> 34:21.150
She...

34:30.530 --> 34:33.170
She was raped.
She was...

34:38.290 --> 34:41.029
And she couldn't tell me because
she was frightened of how I'd react,

34:41.030 --> 34:42.579
of me making her report it,

34:42.580 --> 34:44.239
which God knows
I wouldn't have done,

34:44.239 --> 34:48.150
not if it was something
that she couldn't...

34:54.570 --> 34:56.929
My husband found her.

35:02.830 --> 35:05.980
She hanged herself.
In her bedroom.

35:08.630 --> 35:12.270
I felt sorry for him.
I've seen dead bodies, he hadn't.

35:12.980 --> 35:15.080
I had to look after Ryan.

35:15.690 --> 35:19.759
I didn't have to, but I didn't think
there was an alternative, you know,

35:19.760 --> 35:22.950
and he didn't ask to be...

35:24.570 --> 35:26.849
None of it was his fault, was it?

35:26.850 --> 35:30.299
Complete innocent in the world
and nobody wants you.

35:30.300 --> 35:32.750
I didn't particularly,
but Richard,

35:33.460 --> 35:35.289
my husband,
he couldn't stand it.

35:35.290 --> 35:37.290
He couldn't stand
being in the same house.

35:38.320 --> 35:41.329
I don't know why I'm telling you
this, except, I do my best for him.

35:41.330 --> 35:43.390
With him.
I always have done.

35:44.090 --> 35:46.819
I don't think anybody's ever
questioned that, Catherine.

35:46.820 --> 35:49.100
Oh, hang on,
I do know why I'm telling you.

35:50.510 --> 35:51.810
The father...

35:52.990 --> 35:54.780
-Was he ever...? Caught?
-No.

35:55.890 --> 36:00.310
No. And I could never prove
anything anyway. Not now.

36:01.420 --> 36:03.019
I know who it was, though.

36:03.020 --> 36:04.990
He's been in prison
for eight years.

36:05.320 --> 36:07.679
For supplying drugs,
not for what he did to Becky.

36:07.680 --> 36:10.290
No.
No, he's got away with that.

36:11.090 --> 36:12.849
And this wasn't a

36:12.850 --> 36:15.559
"his word against hers,
she might've given her consent

36:15.560 --> 36:16.869
"but who knows, they were both
a bit drunk" job.

36:16.870 --> 36:20.120
It was brutal.
It was a brutal attack.

36:21.110 --> 36:22.569
But she knew who he was.

36:22.570 --> 36:24.570
She wrote his name
down before she...

36:26.510 --> 36:29.309
I'm terrified if Ryan's like him
in any way shape or form,

36:29.310 --> 36:30.769
which he's bound to be, isn't he?

36:30.770 --> 36:33.659
-Not...
-But no, you're right,

36:33.660 --> 36:37.380
ignoring it won't
make it go away, will it?

36:43.750 --> 36:46.399
Getting changed,
then playing on video games!

36:46.400 --> 36:48.439
It's pizzas for tea!

36:48.440 --> 36:49.970
Fantastic.

37:10.270 --> 37:12.010
-Hello?
<i>-Hello.</i>

37:12.720 --> 37:15.650
You don't fancy going to
Rotherham again tonight, do you?

37:17.010 --> 37:18.770
Are you all right?

37:20.710 --> 37:22.010
I'm just...

37:23.370 --> 37:24.970
..weighing up the pros and cons

37:27.080 --> 37:29.730
of what it would mean
to take the law into your own hands.

37:30.750 --> 37:35.470
Well, the down side, obviously,
would be if you got caught.

37:36.410 --> 37:37.770
Possibly.

37:38.940 --> 37:40.849
I dunno.
I'd say the down side would be

37:40.850 --> 37:42.499
if you didn't feel much
different or better

37:42.500 --> 37:44.150
after you'd done the thing.

37:45.980 --> 37:47.790
Which, why would you?

37:49.750 --> 37:52.030
It isn't like
it'd bring her back, is it?

37:55.130 --> 37:57.470
Don't let yourself
get obsessed with it.

37:58.580 --> 37:59.880
Catherine.

38:01.510 --> 38:05.270
He's low-life.
He's scum.

38:07.350 --> 38:09.370
He'll get what's
coming to him one day.

38:11.570 --> 38:13.409
He just will.

38:13.410 --> 38:15.390
The upside, on the other hand -

38:16.650 --> 38:19.559
the exquisite satisfaction
you'd get from...

38:19.560 --> 38:22.129
grinding his severed
scrotum into the mud

38:22.130 --> 38:24.650
with the underside of
your shittiest shoe.

38:25.970 --> 38:29.119
And then burying his worthless
carcass in a shallow grave

38:29.120 --> 38:31.069
up on the moors, where it can rot,

38:31.070 --> 38:35.290
undisturbed and unloved,
until the end of time.

38:40.150 --> 38:42.630
I'm sure that'd make me feel better.

38:43.810 --> 38:45.170
Just a bit.

38:49.210 --> 38:50.770
Are you all right?

38:56.470 --> 38:58.090
Doesn't it frighten you?

38:59.840 --> 39:01.849
If you ever came
face to face with him,

39:01.850 --> 39:04.339
not knowing what the hell
you might do to him?

39:04.340 --> 39:06.820
You're not going to
actively seek him out.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.300
Are you?

39:38.950 --> 39:42.159
Ashley! Ashley, hi, it's Kevin.
Listen, I think...

39:42.160 --> 39:44.450
I think I may have... I think...

39:45.380 --> 39:46.689
Shit!

39:46.690 --> 39:49.419
Ashley, I think...
Ashley. Hi. It's Kevin.

39:49.420 --> 39:52.009
I think I may have made a mistake
with this Nevison business.

39:52.010 --> 39:55.829
I think...
I think we, we, we...

39:55.830 --> 39:57.830
we need to call the whole thing off.
I think...

39:58.400 --> 40:00.209
Ashley, hi, it's Kevin.
I think...

40:00.210 --> 40:03.090
I may have miscalculated
how much Nevison is worth.

40:04.370 --> 40:08.430
Ashley, I've miscalculated
how much Nevison is worth. Yeah.

40:09.550 --> 40:12.140
Ashley, I've miscalculated
how much Nevison is worth.

40:20.730 --> 40:23.590
-Hello?
<i>-Ashley? It... it's Kevin.</i>

40:25.230 --> 40:26.539
<i>Ashley?</i>

40:26.540 --> 40:28.529
-It's Kevin.
<i>-Hello.</i>

40:28.530 --> 40:30.269
Yeah, look, OK, I've been thinking,

40:30.270 --> 40:32.029
and I don't think this business...

40:32.030 --> 40:33.639
I don't think we should do it,

40:33.640 --> 40:37.439
I think I've bitten off more than...
I think I may have miscalculated

40:37.440 --> 40:40.519
-how much Nevison is...
-<i>Don't ring me, Kevin.</i>

40:40.520 --> 40:42.850
Not on my mobile,
not on the landline.

40:43.410 --> 40:45.619
<i>-I'll see you Saturday.</i>
-No, Ashley, listen...

40:45.620 --> 40:47.459
If this goes tits up,

40:47.460 --> 40:50.029
the police can trace calls,
any calls,

40:50.030 --> 40:51.339
<i>all calls,</i>

40:51.340 --> 40:53.899
<i>so you just keep your nerve
and you don't ring me.</i>

40:53.900 --> 40:55.449
But Ashley...

40:55.450 --> 40:56.949
Ashley!

40:56.950 --> 40:58.389
Shit!

40:58.390 --> 41:00.470
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

41:03.770 --> 41:06.050
-Tosser! Wanker!
-Sorry!

41:40.750 --> 41:44.270
-That would've been an opportunity.
-That was not an opportunity.

41:45.990 --> 41:49.090
-You don't know what you're doing.
-I know what I'm doing.

41:49.550 --> 41:51.309
-Let me drive.
-You're not driving.

41:51.310 --> 41:52.650
I'm driving.

42:29.080 --> 42:32.389
There's a fella at t'front desk
insisting he wants to talk to a

42:32.390 --> 42:34.119
"proper police officer".

42:34.120 --> 42:36.309
He won't give me his name,
he won't say what it's about,

42:36.310 --> 42:38.600
but he does seem a bit upset.

42:40.040 --> 42:41.609
Is he drunk?

42:41.610 --> 42:43.379
No, I don't think so.

42:43.380 --> 42:44.789
Is he off his face on anything?

42:44.790 --> 42:46.799
No, he seems perfectly
normal, really.

42:46.800 --> 42:49.010
He does seem upset,
though.

42:53.490 --> 42:55.000
-Good morning.
-Yes...

42:55.470 --> 42:58.350
-Can I help you?
-OK...

42:59.250 --> 43:01.010
I...
Where to start?

43:01.490 --> 43:02.790
I...

43:04.070 --> 43:05.599
OK, are you...?

43:05.600 --> 43:07.169
I'm a sergeant.
Is that...?

43:07.170 --> 43:09.979
It's the best you're going to get unless
you want to drive over to Todmorden.

43:09.980 --> 43:12.739
No, no, that's...
OK.

43:12.740 --> 43:14.869
So, how it started -

43:14.870 --> 43:18.910
I asked my boss for a rise,
a pay rise, the other day,

43:19.460 --> 43:21.209
and the thing is, you see,
my daughter,

43:21.210 --> 43:24.130
she's been offered...
Well, OK, that's...

43:25.620 --> 43:27.279
Are you here to report
a crime,

43:27.280 --> 43:28.580
-Mr...?
-Not, not...

43:30.140 --> 43:31.650
It's not something that's...

43:42.670 --> 43:45.589
I know this man,
you see, who...

43:45.590 --> 43:48.699
Well, I've always thought
he probably was a bit dodgy,

43:48.700 --> 43:50.669
-if I'm being honest, and...
-What's happened?

43:50.670 --> 43:53.950
Nothing! Nothing's happened.
Nothing's happened yet.

43:56.070 --> 43:57.610
Can I take your name?

43:58.020 --> 43:59.330
I don't...

44:03.390 --> 44:05.390
Are you on any medication?

44:08.270 --> 44:10.029
Would you like some tea?

44:10.030 --> 44:11.719
Then we can sit down
and have a proper chat.

44:11.720 --> 44:13.190
Would you like to do that?

44:13.650 --> 44:15.609
Do you want to make a statement?
Do you want to write it down?

44:15.610 --> 44:16.980
-Would that help?
-There isn't...

44:17.590 --> 44:20.249
-No, no.
-OK. I'll tell you what.

44:20.250 --> 44:22.289
Look, if you go out the door,
turn left,

44:22.290 --> 44:24.569
walk five yards down the
street to the next door.

44:24.570 --> 44:26.679
I'll let you in and then
you can come through to my office,

44:26.680 --> 44:28.740
and you can start at the
beginning, all right?

44:29.450 --> 44:30.750
Yeah?

44:45.210 --> 44:46.629
<i>Bravo November four-five.</i>

44:46.630 --> 44:49.259
<i>Urgent response required to
Flat 12, Waterfield House.</i>

44:49.260 --> 44:52.109
<i>An anonymous caller saying there's
a lad dangling off a balcony.</i>

44:52.110 --> 44:53.810
That's Acid House.
Responding.

44:59.230 --> 45:00.530
Go on.

45:03.890 --> 45:05.810
Stupid tosser.

45:09.650 --> 45:11.209
God, I'm really sorry.

45:11.210 --> 45:13.289
-Idiotic thing to do!
-I'm really, really sorry.

45:13.290 --> 45:15.299
-You were driving far too close.
-Yeah.

45:15.300 --> 45:16.909
You're probably not even insured
properly, are you?

45:16.910 --> 45:18.299
Yeah, no, I am.

45:18.300 --> 45:19.600
Good!

45:21.650 --> 45:24.419
I assume that we're accepting
that you're the one that's at fault.

45:24.420 --> 45:26.529
Well, on the other hand,
you WERE driving

45:26.530 --> 45:29.339
a bit all over t'place,
weren't you, speed-wise?

45:29.340 --> 45:32.340
So it's my fault that you're not
looking at what's in front of you?

45:34.690 --> 45:37.059
-Get the bitch round here!
-What are you doing?

45:37.060 --> 45:39.590
What are you doing?!
What are going doing?!

45:40.240 --> 45:41.540
No!

45:43.710 --> 45:45.010
Shut your mouth!

45:48.410 --> 45:51.230
Get off me! Get off me!

45:55.170 --> 45:56.470
Come on.

45:59.250 --> 46:00.550
Stop wriggling.

46:01.110 --> 46:02.790
Stop wriggling!

46:06.010 --> 46:07.310
Hold still.

46:14.450 --> 46:15.750
Feet.

46:58.890 --> 47:00.320
See you there.

47:10.210 --> 47:11.619
You do what we tell you

47:11.620 --> 47:14.019
and we're not going to hurt you
any more than we have to,

47:14.020 --> 47:16.750
and it'll all be over soon enough,
all right?

47:19.490 --> 47:20.790
All right.

47:34.970 --> 47:37.489
<i>-Hello.</i>
-Ashley, it's me.

47:37.490 --> 47:39.759
Don't hang up on me.
I'm calling from a call box.

47:39.760 --> 47:41.279
Right, what do you want?
And I'm not kidding.

47:41.280 --> 47:43.339
This is the last time you ring me.

47:43.340 --> 47:44.640
<i>Just to say...</i>

47:45.800 --> 47:47.649
<i>Just to say that...</i>

47:47.650 --> 47:51.450
<i>those boys of yours,
they won't hurt her, will they?</i>

47:51.860 --> 47:53.830
<i>You know, she's not a bad kid.</i>

47:54.440 --> 47:57.819
They will treat her with respect,
won't they?

47:57.820 --> 48:00.020
<i>If Nevison plays ball, Kevin,</i>

48:00.860 --> 48:03.190
they will treat her
with every courtesy.

48:03.500 --> 48:04.800
<i>OK?</i>

48:06.890 --> 48:08.499
I should be at work.

48:08.500 --> 48:09.950
<i>Yeah, good.</i>

48:10.470 --> 48:13.850
<i>Right, well,
I'll see you Saturday.</i>

48:14.360 --> 48:15.950
Business as usual.

49:31.930 --> 49:34.250
Don't give me any shit,
you little bastard...

49:35.300 --> 49:37.650
or I'll chop your tits off.

49:53.630 --> 49:56.570
-Let's get that bag off her.
-Nah, leave her.

49:59.570 --> 50:02.170
I've got to get this phone
over to Ashley at t'farm.

50:08.190 --> 50:09.490
What?

50:19.970 --> 50:21.730
Do you know what you just said?

50:24.090 --> 50:25.539
Shit!

50:25.540 --> 50:28.359
She couldn't hear me. She had
t'bag on, she were whimpering.

50:28.360 --> 50:30.469
-She won't have heard owt.
-I am not going back inside

50:30.470 --> 50:33.299
cos of a shit-for-brains
little twat like you.

50:33.300 --> 50:38.239
So, you just think,
every time, every time,

50:38.240 --> 50:40.640
before you open your mouth
down there in future,

50:40.970 --> 50:44.390
or I'll rip your cock off
and shove it up your arse.

50:46.010 --> 50:47.850
She didn't hear anything.

50:49.690 --> 50:51.430
Mind how you go.

51:49.310 --> 51:52.429
<i>Yeah, so he owes his dealer
50-odd quid, right?</i>

51:52.430 --> 51:53.869
<i>Can't pay up.</i>

51:53.870 --> 51:55.549
There's three lads
knocking on his door

51:55.550 --> 51:57.309
whose plan it is
to put him in hospital.

51:57.310 --> 51:59.849
He's inside shitting himself,
thinking there's no way out.

51:59.850 --> 52:02.589
Then he remembers this thing he does
with his mates

52:02.590 --> 52:04.299
when he's high as a kite
on amphetamines.

52:04.300 --> 52:06.219
He plays Spider-Man
down the side of the building.

52:06.220 --> 52:09.379
They drop from one balcony to the
next, all the way down, for fun.

52:09.380 --> 52:12.959
<i>So, he sets off, only he's
stone-cold whatever, right?</i>

52:12.960 --> 52:16.889
<i>So, he sets off over the edge,
manages one balcony,</i>

52:16.890 --> 52:18.199
then he freezes,

52:18.200 --> 52:20.639
realises if you're not off
your face on chemicals,

52:20.640 --> 52:24.229
this is a pretty bloody silly thing to be doing.
-Bless!

52:24.230 --> 52:27.499
Meanwhile the Chipping Norton set
have kicked the door in, right,

52:27.500 --> 52:29.709
quickly work out
what he's gone and done.

52:29.710 --> 52:32.129
<i>They see him, they start
lobbing his worldly goods,</i>

52:32.130 --> 52:34.999
<i>his telly, his Wii, his PlayStation,
his Xbox, his Game Boy,</i>

52:35.000 --> 52:37.679
over the balcony,
hoping to knock him off his perch.

52:37.680 --> 52:40.219
Of course, by the time I arrive

52:40.220 --> 52:42.609
they're well gone
and there's just him dangling there

52:42.610 --> 52:45.839
with his trousers round his ankles,
cos he's wearing those sort of jeans

52:45.840 --> 52:47.940
that have come up
just below your arse.

52:53.210 --> 52:55.110
-Sarge?
<i>-Catch you later.</i>

54:19.770 --> 54:21.870
Hello, my little chickadee.

54:22.910 --> 54:24.210
Is that Nev?

54:25.435 --> 54:27.149
It might be.

54:27.150 --> 54:29.039
<i>Nevison Gallagher?</i>

54:29.040 --> 54:32.499
-Yes.
-How you doing, Nevison Gallagher?

54:32.500 --> 54:34.220
Who am I speaking to?

54:34.800 --> 54:36.690
<i>You can call me...</i>

54:37.870 --> 54:39.179
..God.

54:39.180 --> 54:42.459
What you doing with my daughter's
telephone, then, God?

54:42.460 --> 54:44.899
<i>Well, I've just borrowed it
off her, you see.</i>

54:44.900 --> 54:48.980
-Me and my friends.
<i>-Right, what's going on?</i>

54:49.410 --> 54:51.589
Right, listen very carefully,
Nevison,

54:51.590 --> 54:53.359
cos I'm not repeating meself.

54:53.360 --> 54:55.790
<i>We appear to have got
your lovely little daughter</i>

54:56.520 --> 54:59.109
<i>in a very vulnerable position,</i>

54:59.110 --> 55:03.030
and we're not going to involve
any police, OK?

55:03.640 --> 55:06.850
You do just like you're told,
Nevison, like a good little lad,

55:07.240 --> 55:10.709
<i>-and nothing nasty will happen to her.</i>
-Who are you?

55:10.710 --> 55:13.039
I'm the one that
ensures nothing unpleasant happens

55:13.040 --> 55:14.629
to your little Annie.

55:14.630 --> 55:18.490
<i>I want you to get your car keys
and I want you to walk outside to your car.</i>

55:19.050 --> 55:22.310
<i>Slowly. Don't rush.
Don't speak to anyone.</i>

55:22.620 --> 55:25.590
<i>'I'm going to ring you again
in 20 minutes.</i>

55:27.090 --> 55:30.250
<i>You know Dewsbury Moor Services,
eastbound on the M62.</i>

55:31.160 --> 55:32.699
<i>Phone booths.</i>

55:32.700 --> 55:34.939
<i>Two of them,
just outside the front door.</i>

55:34.940 --> 55:37.059
<i>The one on the left.</i>

55:37.060 --> 55:39.329
<i>You've got 20 minutes.</i>

55:39.330 --> 55:41.519
<i>I want you on your own.</i>

55:41.520 --> 55:43.789
<i>I see any police,
anything that makes me suspicious,</i>

55:43.790 --> 55:45.219
<i>even for a second,</i>

55:45.220 --> 55:48.879
<i>and you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.</i>

55:48.880 --> 55:50.980
Hello?
Hello?!

56:24.410 --> 56:26.430
Are you a virgin?

56:36.890 --> 56:39.620
-Hello?
<i>-Kevin, it's me, it's Nevison.</i>

56:40.370 --> 56:41.979
<i>You're not going to believe this.</i>

56:41.980 --> 56:46.459
<i>Some toerag,
shit-for-brains arsehole...</i>

56:46.460 --> 56:50.209
bastard's got our Annie
and he wants a million quid.

56:50.210 --> 56:52.890
-A million?
-It's for real, it's serious.

56:53.330 --> 56:54.639
OK...

56:54.640 --> 56:57.989
<i>Can we raise it?
Can we raise that much in</i> two days?

56:57.990 --> 57:00.049
-Two... days?
-In cash,

57:00.050 --> 57:02.650
without the bank thinking
we're laundering money?

57:03.350 --> 57:06.779
Well, I... We can...
I can look into the accounts...

57:06.780 --> 57:08.849
We've just got to do it,
we've got to raise it,

57:08.850 --> 57:11.539
<i>because this nasty bastard
means business.</i>

57:11.540 --> 57:15.200
And...
what am I going to tell Helen? Oh!

57:16.270 --> 57:19.400
<i>What the hell am I going
to tell Helen, Kevin?</i>
