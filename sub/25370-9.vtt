_

00:09.111 --> 00:10.634
What happened to your pips?

00:10.706 --> 00:12.302
Dry-cleaners must have forgotten them.

00:13.597 --> 00:17.958
You tell him Turk said, "Pay
up or he's a fucking dead man!"

00:17.964 --> 00:19.166
Take your fuckin' money.

00:19.172 --> 00:21.442
Our little arrangement is over.

00:21.448 --> 00:23.398
If you girls wanna take
your aggro out on each other,

00:23.404 --> 00:25.670
as long as it's mutual
and of your own free will,

00:25.676 --> 00:27.868
- knock yourselves out.
- You wanna fight?

00:27.874 --> 00:30.267
Yeah. Nuh, I'm fuckin' great
at punchin' tits, all right,

00:30.273 --> 00:31.573
so, yeah, I wanna fight.

00:31.579 --> 00:33.476
- You can't fight.
- It's my choice.

00:33.482 --> 00:34.730
So choose me.

00:35.185 --> 00:36.612
Information's power.

00:36.618 --> 00:38.981
You got, like, dirt files or somethin'?

00:38.987 --> 00:40.487
Yeah, that's exactly what I've got.

00:41.477 --> 00:43.785
She was at the same bar with my boy

00:43.791 --> 00:45.777
the night he was attacked,
she might know something.

00:45.783 --> 00:48.096
- Unh!
- She doesn't remember!

00:48.102 --> 00:49.465
How can you be so sure?

00:49.471 --> 00:50.671
She's my sister.

00:50.677 --> 00:53.514
I went to that bar with
Shelley. He raped her.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.389
I just belted him and I ran.

00:55.601 --> 00:57.514
I didn't know he was Danny Winter.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.774
Will, Jake is the prowler!

01:02.780 --> 01:04.788
Vera, I'm standing right
next to him. We're at work.

Vera?! Where's Vera?

02:01.970 --> 02:04.361
- What's happened? Where's Vera?
- No, I'm OK!

02:06.076 --> 02:07.293
I'm OK.

02:23.778 --> 02:26.316
You should find somewhere else to
stay, at least for the short term.

02:26.322 --> 02:27.778
I am not moving out of my house.

02:27.784 --> 02:29.308
I view this as a warning, Ms Bennett.

02:29.314 --> 02:31.273
If she wanted to hurt
me, why didn't she?

02:31.279 --> 02:34.482
This is typical Ferguson
playing her fucking mind games.

02:38.666 --> 02:40.158
We'll get all this tested

02:40.164 --> 02:41.981
and leave a car stationed outside.

02:45.596 --> 02:46.825
You shouldn't stay here.

02:47.199 --> 02:49.014
Uh, where should I stay, Jake?

02:49.374 --> 02:52.319
I am not about to be scared
out of my home by her.

02:52.325 --> 02:55.216
- Why don't we stay around for a bit?
- No, no, go.

02:55.222 --> 02:57.949
Obviously I'll be well
protected, I'll see you tomorrow.

03:08.233 --> 03:11.547
- Mate, are you sure that...
- Yes, I'm sure, OK, I fuckin' buried her.

03:15.334 --> 03:17.653
_

03:37.876 --> 03:39.987
Did you bury me deep enough?

03:42.471 --> 03:44.162
How deep did you dig?

03:44.445 --> 03:46.297
Two feet, three?

03:46.654 --> 03:49.276
But then you couldn't
dig any more, could you?

03:49.889 --> 03:51.694
Couldn't see it through.

03:51.700 --> 03:53.808
You've always lacked courage.

03:53.814 --> 03:57.095
No moral fortitude.

03:57.392 --> 04:00.613
Your wife was murdered,
you forgave her murderer.

04:00.619 --> 04:03.307
Best friend betrays
you, you forgive him too.

04:05.518 --> 04:10.447
Now this place has
squeezed you like a lemon.

04:10.700 --> 04:13.999
- And yet, here you still are.
- I'm not gonna let you

04:14.005 --> 04:16.002
fucking get inside my head again.

04:22.483 --> 04:23.886
Too late...

04:24.737 --> 04:26.450
Mr Jackson.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.736
Don't tell me, milk's off?

04:34.984 --> 04:36.613
Uh, yeah, yeah.

04:36.890 --> 04:39.279
Bread isn't fresh either.
Toaster's on the blink.

04:39.285 --> 04:41.079
I'll just have to steal
one of Jake's apples.

04:42.088 --> 04:43.990
Sierra 1 calling Sierra 6.

04:43.996 --> 04:46.792
- This is Sierra 6, go ahead.
- Police are at the gatehouse.

04:46.798 --> 04:48.514
OK, send them through, I'm on my way.

04:48.583 --> 04:50.107
Is that about Ferguson?

04:50.203 --> 04:51.984
Why would it be about Ferguson?

04:52.188 --> 04:54.665
Cops wanna charge Connors
over Kosta's assault.

05:00.476 --> 05:03.579
Rita Connors, we are here
to formally charge you

05:03.585 --> 05:05.491
with the assault of Vicky Kosta.

05:05.497 --> 05:08.922
I must inform you that you
do not have to say anything...

05:09.302 --> 05:10.753
Haven't heard from you in a while.

05:10.759 --> 05:12.769
- She's got a dirt file.
- A what?

05:12.775 --> 05:14.997
A file. Nasty shit on a lot of people,

05:15.003 --> 05:16.489
that's how Marie controls them.

05:16.495 --> 05:18.607
Including whoever is Winter's protector.

05:18.613 --> 05:21.720
I'd bet on it. We find that
file, we ID the bastard.

05:22.291 --> 05:24.352
So, where is it? In here?

05:25.119 --> 05:26.319
Fuck knows.

05:27.206 --> 05:29.014
- I need more time.
- How long?

05:29.020 --> 05:31.176
- I don't know.
- So, bottom line is, you're no closer.

05:31.182 --> 05:33.006
No, I am close, Jonesie.

05:33.012 --> 05:35.486
- I can feel it, I just need a little...
- We only agreed to this

05:35.492 --> 05:37.366
because you convinced us
that you could pull it off.

05:37.372 --> 05:40.361
- Yeah, I can! I dunno.
- So, who's protecting Winter?

05:42.365 --> 05:45.143
Oh, don't give me that fuckin'
look, Mick. I'm on top of this.

05:45.149 --> 05:47.870
- You can't pull the pin.
- That's not your call, Detective.

05:47.876 --> 05:49.563
We need a name.

05:54.189 --> 05:57.720
- That's it, twist. Yes.
- Ugh!

05:57.726 --> 05:59.935
- Twist more. Yep, that's it.
- Hey, hot stuff?!

06:00.300 --> 06:02.212
You wimped out on me...

06:02.716 --> 06:05.308
but, I'm willin' to give ya another go.

06:05.944 --> 06:07.537
- Argh!
- I'm retired.

06:07.543 --> 06:09.971
You owe me a fuckin'
fight. You and Boomer.

06:09.977 --> 06:11.738
I'm not gonna punch
Boomer, she's my mate.

06:11.744 --> 06:13.050
Hell, you wish.

06:13.143 --> 06:16.460
Oh, n-not the mate bit, like,
'cause we are, but like the...

06:16.466 --> 06:19.345
the punchin', beatin'
stuff, hey, you wish!

06:19.445 --> 06:21.439
Got a better option for you anyway.

06:21.445 --> 06:23.416
- Oh, yeah?
- Cherry.

06:23.422 --> 06:25.341
That rice cracker? Are you serious?

06:25.539 --> 06:27.746
Tomorrow, be ready.

06:27.752 --> 06:29.351
Oh, I'll be ready.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.346
Scars of us! Argh!

06:33.352 --> 06:35.714
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. OK, OK. Yup, yup, all right.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.514
We obviously have a lot of work to do.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.723
OK, it's all in the feet. Right?

06:39.729 --> 06:41.332
- Right.
- Watch me. Watch, watch, watch.

06:42.917 --> 06:45.531
- Hey, sugar.
- Oh, nice work, Booms.

06:45.537 --> 06:47.441
- Are you learnin' to dance?
- Oh, shut up!

06:47.447 --> 06:49.043
- Hey, it's easy.
- Hey, Ru.

06:49.330 --> 06:50.648
I need to tell you something.

06:50.654 --> 06:51.854
- Relax.
- Yeah.

06:53.020 --> 06:54.220
What's up?

06:54.539 --> 06:55.926
I'm really horny.

06:56.524 --> 06:58.333
Oh...

07:02.196 --> 07:04.027
Lucas is coming in today.

07:06.605 --> 07:09.106
Hey! Lucas... he's coming in.

07:09.322 --> 07:11.613
- He's got news.
- What, about Danny?

07:11.619 --> 07:14.018
Maybe. He said it's important.

07:15.592 --> 07:17.100
How'd you go with the cops?

07:19.299 --> 07:21.003
Formally charged me.

07:21.997 --> 07:23.197
Thanks.

07:23.785 --> 07:25.405
I never forget a favour.

07:25.411 --> 07:28.257
- Come here. Come here!
- Ah, ah, no, no, don't mess up me hair!

07:28.263 --> 07:31.562
I'm gonna... Get off...
Oh, are you serious?!

07:31.568 --> 07:34.254
Your sister's certainly
falling on her feet.

07:34.260 --> 07:36.776
- Don't! Then...
- Oh... What?!

07:36.782 --> 07:39.165
Like... take a time out!

07:39.379 --> 07:41.595
- Get a room!
- Oh, well, come on then.

07:41.816 --> 07:45.620
Ooh, OK. One, two, three, four.

07:48.094 --> 07:49.325
Liz.

07:49.331 --> 07:51.714
- What? Uh... mm.
- Community Chest.

07:53.469 --> 07:56.778
Oh, bank error in your
favour, collect 200 bucks.

07:56.784 --> 07:58.761
- What?
- Oh, yeah, like that'd ever happen.

07:59.588 --> 08:01.175
Thank you.

08:01.478 --> 08:02.875
All right, my turn.

08:09.116 --> 08:10.695
I'm gonna tell the kids.

08:10.701 --> 08:13.670
I'm gonna ring Sophie and
Artie and let them know.

08:13.735 --> 08:15.821
- I think that's great.
- Mmm...

08:17.481 --> 08:18.740
Right...

08:19.196 --> 08:20.489
Hey...

08:20.597 --> 08:22.802
I know I'm the one with dementia, love,

08:22.808 --> 08:25.813
but you've landed on
mine, and there's a hotel.

08:36.090 --> 08:37.289
You still horny?

08:37.690 --> 08:40.212
Ah, no, no, no, no, d...

08:40.217 --> 08:41.799
- Piss off!
- Shit!

08:43.152 --> 08:44.462
You deaf?

08:44.468 --> 08:47.173
Sorry. I need to speak to you.

08:48.124 --> 08:49.364
Told ya.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.218
Go directly to Jail.

08:53.224 --> 08:56.097
- Yes!
- Do not pass Go. Do not collection $200.

08:58.620 --> 09:00.191
What the fuck are you doin'?

09:00.319 --> 09:01.724
What does it look like?

09:01.730 --> 09:03.450
You're takin' a big bloody risk.

09:03.456 --> 09:06.033
- What, screwing in the middle of the day?
- No, Allie!

09:06.039 --> 09:09.177
- What about her?
- She and Marie were lovers, eh?

09:09.183 --> 09:12.367
- Yeah, so?
- So, Marie's still keen on her.

09:12.373 --> 09:14.954
You bein' with Allie
keeps Marie's eye on you.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.579
You don't need that, Ru.

09:17.556 --> 09:20.005
Can you get out so I can get dressed?

09:33.302 --> 09:36.269
Forensic report on the gloves
came back negative for DNA.

09:37.757 --> 09:39.599
So she never wore them.

09:39.749 --> 09:41.288
Or she's being careful.

09:41.868 --> 09:44.186
But the boot tread on the carpet

09:44.192 --> 09:46.243
looks like a match for
Ferguson's shoe size.

09:46.249 --> 09:49.108
- So, it could be Ferguson.
- I'm banking on it being her.

09:49.401 --> 09:52.237
- I'm hoping you're her Achilles' heel.
- Terrific.

09:52.243 --> 09:53.847
We'll keep watching your house.

09:54.694 --> 09:58.061
- Who is he?
- Name's Gregory Turkle. Turk.

09:58.067 --> 10:00.053
We believe he's an
associate of Ferguson's

10:00.059 --> 10:02.631
- who aided with her escape.
- Why do you think that?

10:02.637 --> 10:05.555
We traced a $90,000 payment
from Ferguson to Turkle

10:05.561 --> 10:07.864
the day before Nils Jesper was killed.

10:10.609 --> 10:12.036
Mr Stewart?

10:12.415 --> 10:13.714
Can I have a word?

10:23.976 --> 10:25.369
Gregory Turkle.

10:26.667 --> 10:27.867
Turk.

10:31.180 --> 10:32.575
What... what about him?

10:32.581 --> 10:36.391
The day before Nils Jesper was
murdered, Ferguson paid him $90,000.

10:36.909 --> 10:38.820
- How do you know...
- I just know.

10:40.916 --> 10:42.343
Uh...

10:43.090 --> 10:45.246
- OK.
- OK.

10:48.613 --> 10:51.175
You were in debt to Turk over drugs,

10:51.181 --> 10:53.762
and the day before Jesper is shot,

10:53.768 --> 10:55.695
Ferguson wipes your debt.

10:57.788 --> 10:58.988
What's your point?

10:58.994 --> 11:00.886
What'd you do for that money, Jake?

11:01.270 --> 11:02.876
Did you kill Jesper?

11:02.882 --> 11:04.781
- Vera, come on...
- Did you murder Nils Jesper?!

11:04.787 --> 11:05.987
No.

11:06.484 --> 11:07.955
I don't believe you.

11:10.654 --> 11:13.355
It's not true. Vera, it's not...

11:26.574 --> 11:27.933
_

11:29.373 --> 11:30.573
_

11:33.921 --> 11:35.121
_

11:40.394 --> 11:42.012
_

11:42.846 --> 11:44.046
_

11:49.254 --> 11:50.943
_

11:56.244 --> 11:57.837
I already made copies.

11:58.252 --> 11:59.959
By trying to wipe it,

11:59.965 --> 12:01.677
you've told me
everything I need to know.

12:01.683 --> 12:03.788
I'm giving these to the police, Jake.

12:03.859 --> 12:07.299
You taught me one thing
and this is my insurance.

12:08.164 --> 12:09.392
It's over.

12:18.499 --> 12:19.733
Vera knows.

12:20.912 --> 12:22.813
- What?
- No, not about you, about Jesper.

12:22.819 --> 12:24.610
What I did, she fucking knows.

12:24.742 --> 12:25.942
OK.

12:26.710 --> 12:29.112
She's gonna go to the cops,
she's gonna tell them everything.

12:29.504 --> 12:31.017
Well, maybe it's what you deserve.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.607
Yeah?

12:33.996 --> 12:37.123
Well, if I go down, Will,
fucked if I'm goin' alone.

12:56.965 --> 12:58.483
Yes, Vera Bennett.

12:58.674 --> 13:00.070
Governor of Wentworth.

13:00.076 --> 13:02.804
Can you tell Detective
Collins I need to speak to him?

13:03.863 --> 13:05.397
That's right, soon as he can.

13:10.011 --> 13:11.211
Will...

13:12.762 --> 13:13.972
What is it?

13:16.154 --> 13:17.651
You can't dob him in.

13:19.064 --> 13:20.264
He told you?

13:22.947 --> 13:26.749
Did he send you up here?
Do you know what he did?

13:27.453 --> 13:30.094
- Then why the hell are you protecting that criminal?
- I don't...

13:30.100 --> 13:31.715
I don't want to protect him.

13:32.006 --> 13:33.616
I need to protect him.

13:35.493 --> 13:36.693
No.

13:37.836 --> 13:39.036
No!

13:40.066 --> 13:41.724
After everything he has done,

13:41.730 --> 13:43.249
- he is going to jail!
- Vera...

13:43.255 --> 13:45.341
- He's a murderer!
- So am I.

13:48.930 --> 13:50.219
So am I.

13:53.379 --> 13:55.345
What are you talking about?

13:56.768 --> 13:59.295
Jake helped Ferguson escape...

14:00.196 --> 14:01.713
then I killed her.

14:15.032 --> 14:17.408
I found out about the escape first,

14:17.592 --> 14:18.792
told Will...

14:19.393 --> 14:20.888
came up with a plan.

14:21.178 --> 14:23.615
We had no idea Doyle was involved.

14:23.670 --> 14:25.495
We didn't know whose plan it was.

14:25.501 --> 14:26.995
We thought we'd stopped it.

14:27.297 --> 14:30.638
And we just... arranged
for Ferguson to go instead.

14:32.342 --> 14:33.843
How'd you kill her?

14:34.044 --> 14:35.464
I buried her.

14:38.031 --> 14:39.470
You what?

14:41.621 --> 14:43.630
He buried her alive.

14:47.210 --> 14:50.192
How do you know she didn't...

14:52.700 --> 14:53.975
Didn't what?

14:54.573 --> 14:57.295
- Dig her way out.
- She's dead.

14:58.256 --> 14:59.485
Then who is stalking me?

14:59.491 --> 15:01.985
Who is leaving black gloves
on my fucking pillow, Will?

15:02.295 --> 15:04.993
Governor, Detective
Collins is on line one.

15:24.944 --> 15:27.574
Tell the detective I'll call him back.

15:30.780 --> 15:32.257
- Are you gonna...
- Get out.

15:32.580 --> 15:33.844
Both of you.

15:35.216 --> 15:37.240
- Vera...
- I said get out.

15:53.191 --> 15:54.816
How hot is it, Tim?

15:56.795 --> 15:57.995
Sure.

16:01.225 --> 16:03.040
Tell me the words exactly.

16:04.199 --> 16:06.663
- Boo.
- G'day, gorgeous.

16:07.375 --> 16:08.971
- Mmm.
- Mwah! Ha!

16:11.454 --> 16:13.140
Yeah, well, I've, uh...

16:13.146 --> 16:15.618
been living on beer
and bloody doner kebabs.

16:15.624 --> 16:18.743
- I miss your cookin'.
- That shit will clog your arteries, Ray.

16:19.428 --> 16:21.233
Hey, listen, Reets, um...

16:22.422 --> 16:24.033
you bein' in here...

16:25.423 --> 16:28.129
well, it's made me think
of some pretty big stuff.

16:28.135 --> 16:30.077
I'm bloody useless without you.

16:30.458 --> 16:33.188
Oh, I don't... don't just
mean your cookin', I'm...

16:33.361 --> 16:34.769
I mean it, I...

16:34.862 --> 16:37.500
- Mean what?
- I mean, you and me, us.

16:37.506 --> 16:39.995
- Sticking together.
- Yeah, I know.

16:40.664 --> 16:42.645
- We will.
- You promise?

16:44.010 --> 16:45.375
You'll stand by me?

16:47.668 --> 16:48.986
Well...

16:56.362 --> 16:57.992
Make a honest man of me.

16:59.762 --> 17:01.262
Marry me, Reets.

17:04.548 --> 17:06.402
Ah, what do you want me to say?

17:07.660 --> 17:09.179
Well, yes or no.

17:09.906 --> 17:12.351
It's usually one of those two answers.

17:13.910 --> 17:15.446
I need to think about it?

17:16.622 --> 17:17.821
Oh.

17:18.819 --> 17:21.510
And then there's that one. Fuck!

17:26.332 --> 17:28.026
I'll give you an answer.

17:29.903 --> 17:31.179
Tomorrow.

17:32.915 --> 17:34.248
I'm gonna...

17:34.802 --> 17:37.260
I'm gonna book the bloody
visit on the way out.

17:39.018 --> 17:40.716
I'm a patient bastard.

17:51.596 --> 17:54.411
Someone's got a sense of humour,
they put me in Proctor's old cell.

17:54.424 --> 17:57.009
- So, how'd you go with Lucas?
- It's not about Danny.

17:57.015 --> 17:58.509
It's about the rat.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.544
The tip-off came from someone in here.

18:01.550 --> 18:04.862
Someone who got their hands on that
phone after you called Pasquale.

18:04.868 --> 18:07.034
There's only one
person it could've been.

18:09.260 --> 18:12.266
- Why can't you see what she is?
- Because I need more

18:12.272 --> 18:15.379
- than your jealousy to bury Rita.
- OK.

18:15.658 --> 18:16.983
We'll flush her out.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.476
- Then I'll take care of it.
- Attention, compound.

18:19.482 --> 18:22.690
Attention, compound. H Block
are now called for lunch.

18:26.468 --> 18:29.568
Lizzie, I'm really hungry, can
you, like, get a wriggle on?

18:29.574 --> 18:31.761
Well, there's just so much choice.

18:31.767 --> 18:34.243
Yeah, hot dogs, hot dogs, or hot dogs.

18:34.249 --> 18:36.076
Go the hot dogs, Liz, they're not bad.

18:36.082 --> 18:37.437
Can't bugger up a hot dog.

18:38.887 --> 18:41.392
- Oh, thank you, love.
- All right.

18:42.874 --> 18:44.986
And the Butchers have
got the full amount?

18:45.286 --> 18:49.286
- 20 kilos, premium. Meeting in Footscray.
- Dutchie's pub?

18:49.292 --> 18:51.353
Yeah, 2 o'clock tomorrow.

18:55.011 --> 18:56.211
Hey.

18:56.517 --> 18:57.738
Hey...

18:58.010 --> 19:01.811
check her out. Tomorrow she's
toast, I'll snap her in half, eh?

19:01.817 --> 19:03.616
Well, if you eat all that,
you can just fart on her.

19:03.622 --> 19:07.700
Hey, Cherry, I'm gonna
turn you into a sushi roll.

19:07.787 --> 19:10.304
Ho-ho, I'm Chinese, you dumb elephant.

19:10.310 --> 19:13.317
Oh, good comeback. Not.

19:13.323 --> 19:14.704
Oh!

19:16.799 --> 19:18.097
Sorry...

19:20.904 --> 19:22.599
Ha, sushi!

19:27.653 --> 19:28.962
You're dead!

19:29.052 --> 19:30.871
Will they never be clean?

19:30.877 --> 19:33.182
You... are dead!

19:36.657 --> 19:39.752
You... are dead!

19:40.702 --> 19:43.837
You're fucking... dead!

19:44.504 --> 19:48.433
You are fucking... dead!

19:49.137 --> 19:51.543
Hey... Mr Jackson?

19:52.135 --> 19:53.542
Hey, it's OK.

20:02.782 --> 20:03.982
Li?

20:04.079 --> 20:05.522
Clean that shit up.

20:09.533 --> 20:11.333
_

20:15.919 --> 20:18.128
Uncle Frank? It's your favourite niece.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.197
Rita? Good to hear from ya.

20:20.326 --> 20:21.544
How's Auntie Pat?

20:21.550 --> 20:23.465
Auntie Pat's hungry for news.

20:24.316 --> 20:27.868
She still seein' that, um, Dutchman
fella, the one in Footscray?

20:27.874 --> 20:29.487
Tell Auntie Pat when I get out of here,

20:29.493 --> 20:31.987
we're gonna have the
biggest, deadliest barbecue.

20:32.178 --> 20:33.591
Go to the butcher's

20:33.597 --> 20:37.065
and get us, ah, 20 kilos
of the prime beef sausages.

20:37.071 --> 20:38.886
Auntie Pat loves a barbecue.

20:38.892 --> 20:41.679
Even in the middle of
winter, they go hand-in-hand.

20:41.685 --> 20:44.094
Tell Aunt I'll, uh, call tomorrow, 2pm.

20:44.100 --> 20:46.712
- Tomorrow, 2pm, righto.
- See ya.

20:48.036 --> 20:50.131
Yeah, salt and vinegar.

20:50.429 --> 20:51.629
Crap!

21:00.315 --> 21:01.957
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:05.125 --> 21:06.633
You got kids, Liz?

21:06.639 --> 21:09.040
Yeah! Yeah, I do, I've got two.

21:09.117 --> 21:11.124
A boy, Artie, and a girl, Sophie.

21:11.130 --> 21:12.627
Oh, nice.

21:13.116 --> 21:14.352
What about you?

21:14.503 --> 21:16.748
Yeah, I got a boy.

21:19.204 --> 21:21.035
Miss 'em in here, don't ya?

21:21.217 --> 21:22.535
Oh, yeah.

21:23.820 --> 21:26.954
I mean, Artie and I don't have a
lot to do with each other, but...

21:27.511 --> 21:31.970
Soph and me, we're...
we're pretty close. Yeah.

21:32.285 --> 21:34.194
Well, you cherish that, Liz?

21:35.484 --> 21:37.686
Yeah, all right... I do.

21:38.891 --> 21:40.091
Yeah.

21:41.171 --> 21:42.371
Hey.

21:52.262 --> 21:53.823
So, you and Ruby?

21:55.062 --> 21:58.747
Oh, she's a sweet kid, I'm
really happy for you. Really.

22:01.533 --> 22:03.453
Do you know Ruby was at the same bar

22:03.459 --> 22:05.509
Danny was at the night it happened?

22:06.721 --> 22:07.988
What?

22:08.209 --> 22:09.899
She didn't tell you that?

22:10.014 --> 22:11.390
No, I...

22:12.199 --> 22:15.085
I tried to talk to Ruby, you know...

22:15.199 --> 22:17.103
just ask her who was there.

22:17.109 --> 22:19.819
I mean I admit Zara may have
been a bit heavy-handed...

22:19.993 --> 22:21.593
Why are you tellin' me this?

22:21.599 --> 22:24.610
Well, maybe Ruby might know
something that can help?

22:24.989 --> 22:27.904
You know, we need to find
out who killed our Danny.

22:28.807 --> 22:31.522
I've got some pictures
I'd like you to show her.

22:37.074 --> 22:39.796
Your behaviour recently all makes...

22:39.884 --> 22:41.949
horrible sense to me now.

22:43.244 --> 22:46.258
Help me understand,
I need to understand.

22:47.038 --> 22:49.863
Why... did you do it?

22:51.274 --> 22:53.258
I saved her from that fire.

22:54.439 --> 22:56.551
She was dead, but I pulled her out.

22:58.939 --> 23:01.344
So, everything that
happened after that, to...

23:01.431 --> 23:03.925
to Bea, you, the women...

23:04.852 --> 23:06.789
- even Jake...
- Will, don't.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.915
She was toxic, Vera.

23:09.195 --> 23:10.932
She's fucking cancer.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.991
After the women decided to lynch her...

23:15.685 --> 23:17.103
that was it for her.

23:17.382 --> 23:18.982
If I didn't kill her...

23:20.017 --> 23:21.622
Kaz would've had to.

23:22.905 --> 23:24.587
And I can't live with that.

23:26.223 --> 23:28.208
Why didn't I just let her hang?

23:32.103 --> 23:34.036
Why didn't I just let her hang?

23:39.896 --> 23:42.991
Even dead... she is controlling us.

23:43.391 --> 23:45.643
If I go to the police, she wins.

23:47.116 --> 23:48.629
She wins.

23:50.746 --> 23:52.359
And she can't, Will.

23:54.039 --> 23:55.373
She can't.

24:14.631 --> 24:15.957
Soph?

24:18.608 --> 24:20.020
Sophie?

24:22.006 --> 24:23.637
Oh, Sophie?

24:25.416 --> 24:26.854
Sophie?

24:27.203 --> 24:28.693
Hey...

24:29.198 --> 24:32.080
- Ooh-ooh? Ooh-ooh.
- Mmm?

24:32.086 --> 24:33.794
It's time to get up, love.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.907
- You're gonna be late for school, come on.
- Hey?

24:35.913 --> 24:37.805
- What? It's night-time.
- Hmm?

24:37.811 --> 24:39.011
It's night-time.

24:39.017 --> 24:41.645
Hmm, I'm gonna get you a MILO, hon.

24:42.403 --> 24:44.021
- Liz?
- Look at you...

24:52.402 --> 24:53.602
Boomer?

24:53.608 --> 24:54.808
Yeah.

24:56.394 --> 24:58.125
Come back to bed, Liz.

24:58.791 --> 25:01.447
I must've been having a... what's...

25:01.453 --> 25:03.241
What's that thing called when ya...

25:03.247 --> 25:05.925
- you know, when you wake...?
- Sleepwalking?

25:05.931 --> 25:07.214
- Yes! Yeah, that's...
- Sleepwalking.

25:07.220 --> 25:09.064
I must've been sleepwalking.

25:09.146 --> 25:10.555
I'm sorry, love.

25:10.561 --> 25:12.729
- Oh, it's all right.
- I'm sorry.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.529
- Come on, honey.
- Oh...

25:18.621 --> 25:20.855
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.

25:21.743 --> 25:24.001
- Liz, are you right?
- Yeah... yeah, I'm right.

25:24.007 --> 25:25.697
We're just havin' a little sleepwalk.

25:26.287 --> 25:28.295
- This is me.
- Yeah.

25:28.787 --> 25:31.088
Talk about freakin' me out, eh?

25:32.292 --> 25:33.828
She thought I was Sophie.

25:34.503 --> 25:37.431
- Oh, man...
- It's a grog. You know...

25:37.526 --> 25:40.135
it's like my syndrome,
eh? It's just... just...

25:40.778 --> 25:42.909
fucks with your brain cells. It's...

25:43.598 --> 25:45.191
Hey, I'm gonna make
a cuppa, you want one?

25:45.197 --> 25:47.517
No, I'm all right. I'll...
I'll see you back in bed, eh?

26:14.045 --> 26:15.545
What the fuck is this?

26:16.036 --> 26:17.748
Are you spying for her?

26:18.140 --> 26:21.928
What...? Who, Marie? No...

26:22.243 --> 26:25.053
She just... she...

26:25.139 --> 26:27.272
She just asked if I
would show you these.

26:27.278 --> 26:28.934
I guess she was hoping
that you could identify...

26:28.940 --> 26:30.492
Who's fucking girlfriend are ya?!

26:30.930 --> 26:32.453
Mine, or Marie's?

26:32.562 --> 26:34.539
- Ruby, come on...
- Fuck you.

26:34.904 --> 26:37.534
- Ruby, come on! I don't...
- No!

26:37.621 --> 26:40.520
Hey...? Ruby...?

26:41.707 --> 26:42.907
Hey?!

26:42.913 --> 26:45.799
- Ruby, can you at least let me explain?
- Allie!

26:46.120 --> 26:47.530
Keep it down.

27:19.087 --> 27:22.276
No, they never told me, so
I said, nuh, I wasn't in.

27:27.053 --> 27:28.474
Hey.

27:34.031 --> 27:37.342
Well, after that useless bloody
kiss, I'm not gonna push things.

27:38.063 --> 27:41.743
You don't have to make a decision,
we can... we can just have a chat.

27:41.749 --> 27:43.105
I know you, Ray,

27:43.111 --> 27:45.100
get somethin' into that
thick skull of yours,

27:45.106 --> 27:47.804
and you won't be satisfied till
it's all sorted one way or another.

27:47.810 --> 27:49.215
Yeah, fuck it, you're right.

27:51.516 --> 27:52.939
So, let's sort it...

27:55.405 --> 27:56.826
one way, or the other.

27:59.256 --> 28:00.524
The thing is...

28:00.530 --> 28:02.822
You think I'm gonna
get killed, don't ya?

28:06.265 --> 28:07.945
Well... yeah.

28:07.951 --> 28:10.345
I still have nightmares
about that bloody drive-by,

28:10.351 --> 28:12.424
wakin' up to bullets flyin'
through the bedroom window.

28:12.430 --> 28:13.942
Well, that's all sorted.

28:14.226 --> 28:15.515
It is.

28:15.622 --> 28:17.934
We sorted it out with
the Butchers weeks ago.

28:17.940 --> 28:19.459
- How?
- We had a sit down,

28:19.465 --> 28:21.258
agreed to divvy up the pud.

28:21.641 --> 28:23.967
We get drugs and gambling, and, um,

28:23.973 --> 28:27.254
they get prozzies and
protection. Everyone's happy.

28:28.842 --> 28:30.042
Why?

28:31.756 --> 28:33.065
The Butchers?

28:33.071 --> 28:35.049
You're sure they're
not into drugs any more?

28:35.055 --> 28:36.565
Yeah, that's what I told ya.

28:36.571 --> 28:38.208
How sure, Ray?

28:38.380 --> 28:39.983
It was their idea.

28:40.462 --> 28:42.726
After all the shit we went
through to make the truce,

28:42.732 --> 28:44.240
there's no way they'd break it.

28:46.844 --> 28:48.053
Shit.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.794
- What the fu...?
- Can I get out, please?

28:50.336 --> 28:51.665
Hey...?

29:00.044 --> 29:02.377
This is Frank, leave a message.

29:02.383 --> 29:05.343
It's Rita. Tell Auntie
Pat the Dutchman's no good,

29:05.349 --> 29:07.047
he's no fuckin' good!

29:17.896 --> 29:19.096
- Move!
- Oi!

29:19.102 --> 29:20.540
You wanna start somethin'?

29:27.528 --> 29:29.273
- Yeah?
- Ray, listen to me.

29:29.279 --> 29:31.083
For fuck's sake, Reets, if
you don't wanna marry me,

29:31.089 --> 29:33.362
- just say so.
- Shut up and listen!

29:34.163 --> 29:36.569
I do wanna marry you,
Ray, and I love ya,

29:36.575 --> 29:38.199
but there's somethin' you need to know.

29:38.205 --> 29:40.084
Huh? No more bets?!

29:40.090 --> 29:42.482
That's it, that's it. Get her, Booms!

29:43.188 --> 29:44.763
- Come on.
- Ding ding!

29:46.375 --> 29:48.058
Come on, Boomer, that's it!

29:48.064 --> 29:49.675
- That's it, weave!
- Come on, Boomer!

29:51.087 --> 29:54.161
That's it! Wipe that
smile off of her face!

30:03.106 --> 30:04.500
She's out!

30:07.424 --> 30:09.426
Cherry! Cherry!

30:09.432 --> 30:10.901
Cherry! Cherry!

30:10.907 --> 30:13.499
- You OK, Booms?
- What? Did I win?

30:28.397 --> 30:29.817
Show me where you buried her.

30:30.178 --> 30:31.700
I want you to take me there.

30:33.102 --> 30:34.302
Why?

30:36.595 --> 30:38.222
To prove you went through with it.

30:38.408 --> 30:40.020
I fuckin' buried her, OK?

30:40.026 --> 30:41.729
Maybe you didn't, I dunno...

30:42.013 --> 30:44.312
then maybe you had second
thoughts and dug her up.

30:44.418 --> 30:45.618
Maybe you were too chickenshit

30:45.620 --> 30:47.336
to go through with it, and you
made a fucking deal with her.

30:47.342 --> 30:48.918
Are you... are you serious right now?!

30:48.986 --> 30:50.907
- Someone's stalking Vera...
- Maybe it was you.

30:50.913 --> 30:53.185
How could it be me? I was
with you when it was happening.

30:53.191 --> 30:55.608
- Take me there.
- Mr Jackson!

30:57.117 --> 30:58.535
What is going on?!

31:00.934 --> 31:02.444
- Will, take the day off.
- I'm OK.

31:02.450 --> 31:03.743
That wasn't a request.

31:13.596 --> 31:15.372
Don't trust Jake.

31:15.578 --> 31:18.527
You know what he wants,
don't you? He's playing you.

31:18.991 --> 31:22.189
He knows you're falling apart, and
he's tryin' to pin it all on you,

31:22.195 --> 31:24.525
so he gets away scot-free.

31:49.653 --> 31:52.772
_

32:04.534 --> 32:07.550
- I told you to go.
- I think it's Jake who is stalking you.

32:07.556 --> 32:10.593
- Well, Will, I thought so too, but...
- No, no, he wants... No, listen...

32:10.599 --> 32:12.451
he wants me to think
that she's still alive,

32:12.457 --> 32:14.852
so I'll be forced to take
him to where I buried her.

32:15.379 --> 32:18.372
- Why?
- If he knows where Ferguson's body is...

32:18.378 --> 32:20.094
he can set me up to take the fall.

32:20.864 --> 32:25.223
H-how... can Jake have put
the gloves on my pillow?

32:25.229 --> 32:26.660
He was with you when it happened.

32:26.666 --> 32:28.261
He could've done if he had a partner.

32:29.234 --> 32:30.537
I checked his phone.

32:30.543 --> 32:33.235
He's been getting urgent messages
from someone who wants to meet him.

32:33.241 --> 32:35.854
- Who?
- Ah, someone called Turk.

32:41.252 --> 32:44.179
What the fuck? Fuckin' hell!

32:46.511 --> 32:47.844
Let her go, Zara.

32:49.018 --> 32:50.218
Fuck!

32:54.527 --> 32:56.970
So, you told your boyfriend, hmm?

32:57.165 --> 32:59.965
About the little drug deal
you overheard us talking about

32:59.971 --> 33:01.262
with the Butchers?

33:01.479 --> 33:02.679
Didn't you?

33:03.550 --> 33:04.955
I dunno what you're talkin' about.

33:04.961 --> 33:06.296
She's lying.

33:07.934 --> 33:11.054
Your gang, they showed
up demanding the drugs...

33:11.648 --> 33:14.873
Only there weren't any
drugs, because we set you up.

33:14.879 --> 33:16.561
And why would you set me up?

33:16.567 --> 33:18.474
You're the fucking rat.

33:23.254 --> 33:26.061
OK. I told Ray, sure.

33:26.143 --> 33:27.445
But only because I thought the Butchers

33:27.451 --> 33:29.145
- were double-crossing 'em.
- Bullshit.

33:29.151 --> 33:31.548
My loyalty's to the Conquerors,
and that's just the way it is.

33:31.554 --> 33:33.715
And I'm sorry if you're
pissed off, Marie,

33:33.721 --> 33:36.145
but my club means more
to me than anything...

33:36.151 --> 33:37.942
including you.

33:38.221 --> 33:40.920
She's the snitch. She told the cops.

33:40.926 --> 33:43.761
The cops? What? Where they there?

33:44.031 --> 33:46.063
She's playing us, Marie.

33:46.936 --> 33:48.158
Connors...

33:48.164 --> 33:49.579
get your arse out here!

33:50.059 --> 33:51.377
Excuse me.

34:05.134 --> 34:08.094
- So, what the fuck was that about?
- Had no choice.

34:08.100 --> 34:10.869
So you send your bikie mates
in there to fuck up the sting?

34:10.875 --> 34:13.583
It was a set up, Jonesie.
There were no drugs.

34:13.589 --> 34:15.493
If you'd have gone in there,
you'd have blown my cover.

34:15.498 --> 34:17.670
If you haven't done it
now by draggin' me in here

34:17.676 --> 34:19.985
- for this friggin' interview.
- So, why was it a set-up?

34:20.254 --> 34:21.974
Winter and Drago are suss on me.

34:21.980 --> 34:23.875
Oh... fuck.

34:24.266 --> 34:25.879
So, is your cover still good?

34:25.885 --> 34:28.962
I dunno, but this is
definitely a setback.

34:28.967 --> 34:31.010
I just need more time to
win Marie's trust back...

34:31.016 --> 34:32.726
We don't have a lot of time, Rita.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.034
Maybe we can do somethin'
to speed things up.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.239
Like what?

34:36.940 --> 34:39.371
Just leave it with
us, we'll sort it out.

34:48.254 --> 34:49.454
Turk?!

34:50.460 --> 34:51.916
Turk, it's me!

34:51.922 --> 34:53.828
- Hey.
- Oh, hey mate, listen...

34:56.263 --> 34:58.557
- Why are the cops all over me, Jakey?
- The cops?

34:58.563 --> 35:00.876
Why are they asking me
questions about the 90 grand?

35:00.882 --> 35:02.795
- I don't know.
- Gah!

35:03.358 --> 35:05.940
This is the second time
I've had a gun in your face.

35:05.946 --> 35:08.337
If you wanna live, you better
come up with a better answer

35:08.343 --> 35:11.162
than "I don't fucking
know". Now, what is goin' on?

35:11.168 --> 35:12.783
- I...
- Don't say it.

35:22.175 --> 35:23.754
Let's go, Jake. Come on, let's go.

35:36.076 --> 35:38.489
- Morning. Thank you.
- Morning, Governor.

35:52.460 --> 35:53.660
You gonna tell her?

35:53.969 --> 35:55.169
I was wrong.

35:56.166 --> 35:57.989
Jake wasn't working with Turk.

35:57.995 --> 36:00.357
- Well, you could've just asked me that.
- Yeah, then I wouldn't have been there

36:00.363 --> 36:02.166
- to save your arse.
- OK, just stop.

36:03.269 --> 36:07.377
Did Ferguson ever say anything to
you about a "shiny, little crown"?

36:07.383 --> 36:10.105
My Governor epaulettes, did
she ever mention anything

36:10.111 --> 36:11.915
- to you about them?
- No.

36:12.426 --> 36:16.042
OK, when Ferguson first arrived
as a prisoner, she taunted me.

36:16.048 --> 36:18.882
She said, "I am coming for
that shiny, little crown".

36:18.888 --> 36:22.504
It was a private conversation. I
have never told anyone about it.

36:22.510 --> 36:26.024
A few weeks ago... my
epaulettes went missing.

36:26.030 --> 36:29.197
I blamed the dry cleaner,
but given recent events...

36:29.203 --> 36:30.800
Well, maybe she told someone about it?

36:30.806 --> 36:33.235
Well maybe, but the most
likely person was Jake,

36:33.241 --> 36:35.762
- and if it wasn't him...
- What are you trying to say?

36:35.936 --> 36:37.136
What...?!

36:37.460 --> 36:39.971
What... that-that...
that Ferguson's still...?

36:40.708 --> 36:43.632
- Have you ever been back?
- Why would I go back there?

36:44.139 --> 36:46.235
To make sure the body is still there?

36:47.931 --> 36:49.842
This is fucked!

37:05.540 --> 37:07.368
You can't trust Vera, either.

37:07.539 --> 37:09.348
They both know you're the weak link.

37:09.354 --> 37:10.739
They'll betray you.

37:11.737 --> 37:14.576
No... no, not Vera.

37:14.582 --> 37:16.892
- You know it.
- Not Vera, never.

37:16.898 --> 37:19.194
- You know it, they'll both betray you.
- No, no you're wrong.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.884
- They'll both betray you.
- No, you're wrong.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.365
They'll both betray you.

37:22.371 --> 37:24.080
- They'll both betray you.
- You're dead.

37:24.086 --> 37:25.487
They'll both betray you.

37:25.493 --> 37:26.874
- They'll both betray you.
- Fuck you!

37:26.880 --> 37:28.699
They'll both... Ch...

37:29.356 --> 37:30.556
You're gone.

38:03.036 --> 38:04.236
I'll do it.

38:05.540 --> 38:07.663
I'll go back there tonight,
make sure she's there.

38:11.140 --> 38:13.521
- I'm coming, too. Yes.
- No.

38:13.636 --> 38:16.235
I won't be satisfied until
I see her with my own eyes.

38:17.723 --> 38:19.322
I need to see her, too.

38:26.523 --> 38:27.959
Are you all right, love?

38:29.330 --> 38:31.951
- Hmm? Oh, yeah.
- Here, we'll get you some toast, love.

38:31.957 --> 38:33.222
- Hang on. Here you go...
- Yeah.

38:33.228 --> 38:35.447
- have that. All right.
- Thanks.

38:36.452 --> 38:37.652
Come on.

38:38.771 --> 38:40.757
You'll fuckin' keep, bitch.

38:42.271 --> 38:45.654
- You're always fuckin' boxin'!
- Is that right?

38:45.660 --> 38:47.505
All right, I'll fuckin'
fight you dirty next time!

38:47.511 --> 38:49.572
- Boomer... fuckin' sit down!
- No, no, no...!

38:50.292 --> 38:51.507
Ooh!

38:52.108 --> 38:54.092
You oughta be ashamed of yourself!

38:54.868 --> 38:57.185
- Come on, help me pick it up.
- Oh... yeah.

39:01.493 --> 39:02.693
What?

39:04.180 --> 39:06.312
I fucked up, OK?

39:06.318 --> 39:09.718
But I swear to God, I'm not Marie's spy.

39:10.196 --> 39:11.932
I loved Danny.

39:12.310 --> 39:14.129
He was like my little brother, I...

39:14.135 --> 39:16.810
That's why I told Marie that
I'd show you those photos,

39:16.816 --> 39:19.117
I just want to help her
find out who killed him.

39:22.996 --> 39:24.289
I freaked out.

39:25.431 --> 39:27.798
I freaked out because I'm scared.

39:27.804 --> 39:29.309
Well, scared of what?

39:29.315 --> 39:31.534
You and Marie, what you had.

39:31.996 --> 39:33.603
Way in the past.

39:33.609 --> 39:35.885
Still, I-I can't compete with that.

39:36.179 --> 39:38.870
It's not a competition,
I wanna be with you...

39:39.568 --> 39:40.869
not her.

39:42.599 --> 39:44.389
Oh, OK.

39:58.392 --> 40:01.911
We got word from the outside.
We know who the rat is.

40:03.884 --> 40:06.189
Makes me very happy it's not you, Rita.

40:06.297 --> 40:10.372
However... you did betray
me to your boyfriend.

40:10.378 --> 40:13.663
I understand how important loyalty
is, so I respect that choice,

40:13.669 --> 40:16.199
but unfortunately, I can
never trust you again.

40:16.205 --> 40:20.066
So, you pick up that tray...
and move to another table.

40:58.206 --> 40:59.577
Oh, shit.

40:59.583 --> 41:01.288
Oh, shit!

41:08.100 --> 41:11.589
Fuck... fuckin'...

41:20.660 --> 41:22.363
Fuck...

42:00.260 --> 42:01.461
What do you want?

42:01.559 --> 42:03.186
This is for Marie.

42:04.257 --> 42:07.055
- Oof!
- You're a fucking rat!

42:11.524 --> 42:13.338
Help! Stop!

42:48.700 --> 42:51.505
Oh, Che... Cherry... Oh, Che...

43:20.700 --> 43:23.100
Uncle Frank, what the fuck did you do?

43:23.106 --> 43:25.374
We fixed your mess, they got their rat.

43:25.380 --> 43:27.794
I never asked you to. Fuck!
