* Please have mercy on me *

And as soon as
I started doing that,

"The Voice" plays well
to my strength of performing.

At the beginning of 2020,
the pandemic hit,

02:15.677 --> 02:20.181
and all my gigs
were canceled.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.475
So I came up with the idea

02:22.517 --> 02:25.520
to do what I call
a "drive-up concert."

02:25.562 --> 02:27.564
The reaction
was incredible.

02:27.605 --> 02:31.818
I think all the time
I've spent performing live

02:31.860 --> 02:36.197
has really prepared me
to perform on "The Voice,"

02:36.239 --> 02:38.992
and really
put it all out there.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.368

out of high school.

the deep end.

except for that one very moment.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.152

heard my voice

03:14.194 --> 03:15.695

"I want him."

it's so theatrical and creative.

About Me)" by Simple Minds.

03:39.052 --> 03:43.056

come see about me? *
And there's a reason why
that song is still a hit today.

it's a perfect song.

so much melody.

a little bit, because,

04:10.917 --> 04:13.753

is so emotional.

04:13.795 --> 04:17.507
And the melody that was written
is already super good --

04:17.549 --> 04:19.926
way better than I can
rewrite it, or anyone could.

Well, that was fun.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.221
It was fun!

09:15.263 --> 09:18.433
That was so entertaining, and it
was such a great song choice.

09:18.475 --> 09:21.394
It just worked so well.
It was, like, so compelling.

09:21.436 --> 09:25.398
I especially liked the -- the
"Don't, don't, don't, don't."

09:25.440 --> 09:26.691
Yeah, that was cool.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.735

It really worked.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.071
Kique, your voice was fun
'cause you had

09:31.112 --> 09:33.907
some interesting, like,
tones and pronunciations

09:33.948 --> 09:36.785
that made your take on the song
different.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.620
But it sounded really cool
to me, as well.

09:38.661 --> 09:39.913
Thank you.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.165
And then, Tanner,
you just sounded like

09:42.207 --> 09:43.750
you were supposed to make
this song.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.752
You felt so confident.

09:45.794 --> 09:48.755
And then, your tone was, like,
so spot-on.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.758
It felt like I got transported
to the moment

09:51.800 --> 09:52.967
when the song came out.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.177
Based on
that performance,

09:54.219 --> 09:55.595
I would definitely pick
Tanner.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.514
It worked for me
perfectly.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.224
Wow.
Thank you so much.

I was born to that song.

10:07.857 --> 10:11.027
You weren't even <i>conceived</i>
to that song.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.113
The thing that really
gets me fired up is,

10:13.154 --> 10:16.074
when I hear someone
come on the stage

10:16.116 --> 10:18.993
that doesn't sound like
anyone else.

10:19.035 --> 10:22.956
To me, Kique has this voice
that is completely different.

how you guys performed that.

For me, Kique,
you're pitch-perfect.

were tight and clean.

43:36.366 --> 43:38.868
Aww. Thank you.
I know our singers are gonna
flip when they see you.

43:38.910 --> 43:40.954
Thank you for having me.
Thank you.
Yes. Thank you.

43:40.995 --> 43:43.331
All right, so,
we've got Kim and David.

43:43.373 --> 43:44.833
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my God.

43:44.874 --> 43:47.127
This is really happening.
This is crazy.

43:47.168 --> 43:49.254
Kim is definitely
incredible.

43:49.295 --> 43:52.215
* If life was a movie *

43:52.257 --> 43:55.719
* Then you're the best part *

43:55.760 --> 43:57.012
* Woooooha *

43:57.053 --> 44:00.181
Really soulful, jazzy,
just beautiful.

44:00.223 --> 44:03.351
Whoo!

44:03.393 --> 44:05.478
Four chairs!

44:05.520 --> 44:08.356
And then, David,
the wildest thing about him is

44:08.398 --> 44:10.525
he played
my body double.

44:10.567 --> 44:11.901
[ Both chuckle ]
What?

44:11.943 --> 44:14.112
And he had a choice
between me and another coach.

44:14.154 --> 44:15.739
And I was like,
"Come on, now, you got --

44:15.780 --> 44:18.199
You -- You literally were
my body double."
Right. Right.

44:18.241 --> 44:19.993
* You'll never need me *

44:20.035 --> 44:25.540
* Aga-a-a-a-a-in *

44:25.582 --> 44:27.917
I was the first person
to turn for him.

44:27.959 --> 44:31.296
* Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa *

44:31.338 --> 44:33.548
* Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa *
Oh, wow.

44:33.590 --> 44:37.969
You made it really dramatic
and soulful and heartfelt.

44:38.011 --> 44:40.430
I loved your performance.

44:40.472 --> 44:43.224
Thank you so much.

44:43.266 --> 44:45.560
Come on in,
Kim and David.
[ Laughs ]

44:45.602 --> 44:47.896
* Come on in,
come on in, in, in, in *

44:47.937 --> 44:49.564
* Wait till you see
my special guest *
* Come on in, in, in *

44:49.606 --> 44:51.274
* Wait till you see
my special guest *

44:51.316 --> 44:52.901
* Whoo!
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm *

44:52.942 --> 44:53.902
All right.

44:53.943 --> 44:54.903
Oh, my God.

44:54.944 --> 44:56.488
Look who's here.

44:56.529 --> 44:57.739
This is crazy.

44:57.781 --> 45:00.575
* Hey, hey, hey, hey *
The queen of runs!

45:00.617 --> 45:02.786
* Hey, hey, hey, hey *
Jazmine Sullivan is here.
Oh, my gosh!

45:02.827 --> 45:05.955
One of the greatest vocalists
of this generation.

45:05.997 --> 45:08.792
Jazmine Sullivan
is Team Legend's adviser.

45:08.833 --> 45:10.418
Hey. Hi.
How you doing?
Great to see you.

45:10.460 --> 45:11.920
I love you
so frickin' much.
Thank you!

45:11.961 --> 45:13.546
David: I've always been obsessed
with her.

45:13.588 --> 45:15.924
She is such
an important voice.

45:15.965 --> 45:18.760
Kim: Today is definitely a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

45:18.802 --> 45:20.929
And I didn't even have to buy
VIP tickets.

**

45:23.598 --> 45:27.268
* These days
that feel like you and me *

45:27.310 --> 45:29.270
* Heartbreak anniversary *

45:29.312 --> 45:31.940
* Do you ever think of *
David and Kim -- they're
performing a Giveon song...

45:31.981 --> 45:33.733
* Do you ever,
do, do you ever *
...called
"Heartbreak Anniversary."

45:33.775 --> 45:36.069
I wanted to see
these two soulful artists...

45:36.111 --> 45:38.822
* Do you ever,
do, do you ever *
...sing a great contemporary
soul song.

45:38.863 --> 45:42.450
* Think of me, oh *

45:42.492 --> 45:44.202
* I *

45:44.244 --> 45:46.162
Kim: I can relate
to this song...
Hey!

45:46.204 --> 45:48.456
* Said I get like this
every time *
...because I had a relationship

45:48.498 --> 45:51.960
that I experienced
a great deal of heartbreak from.

45:52.002 --> 45:53.420
I got a bite.

45:53.461 --> 45:55.213
My dad knows
I love nature,

45:55.255 --> 45:58.508
and being around nature
is definitely, to me,

45:58.550 --> 46:00.343
the best remedy
for heartbreak.

46:00.385 --> 46:01.720
Woman:
She got a fish out.

46:01.761 --> 46:03.638
Kim:
So, we would go fishing.
[ Laughs ]

46:03.680 --> 46:05.682
And when I'm out there,
I can just be me.

46:05.724 --> 46:07.726
I caught it,
but I'm not gonna eat it.

46:07.767 --> 46:09.894
It just gives you peace

46:09.936 --> 46:12.188
and just a moment
to just reflect.

46:12.230 --> 46:13.565
You guys are amazing.

46:13.606 --> 46:15.275
Standing in front of royalty
right here.

46:15.316 --> 46:17.652
I love when
you harmonize together.
Thank you.

46:17.694 --> 46:20.321
I think the only thing
I would not do

46:20.363 --> 46:24.159
is ad-lib over each other
during those early sections.

46:24.200 --> 46:26.453
* Why you walk out
my life? *

46:26.494 --> 46:27.954
* Yeah *

46:27.996 --> 46:30.331
It's a little too, uh
choir-y in that moment.
Okay.

46:30.373 --> 46:32.292
It should be
a little more laid back.

46:32.334 --> 46:34.419
* Why you walk out
my life? *

46:34.461 --> 46:36.838
Maybe just something
a little lighter, too.
Little simpler.

46:36.880 --> 46:39.049
I was coming in
like a choir.

46:39.090 --> 46:40.842
* Why you walk out my life?
Yeah *

46:40.884 --> 46:42.427
Jazmine: Kim has
one of those voices that...
Whoo!

46:42.469 --> 46:43.928
...you just
will never forget.

46:43.970 --> 46:45.930
It's just like,
"I've never heard this before."

46:45.972 --> 46:47.390
This is her sound.

46:47.432 --> 46:50.518
* Still have
your things here *
Sing.

46:50.560 --> 46:52.312
Girl.
* They stare at me
like souvenirs *

46:52.354 --> 46:53.897
And it's just so warm
and inviting.

46:53.938 --> 46:55.523
She the real deal,
seriously.

46:55.565 --> 46:59.194
Girl, you make me literally
want to just sing with you.

46:59.235 --> 47:01.112
That tone was, like,
otherworldly.

47:01.154 --> 47:02.405
You sound like
an instrument.

47:02.447 --> 47:04.532
It's amazing.
So good.

47:04.574 --> 47:06.910
But I think maybe back up
a little bit from the mic,

47:06.951 --> 47:09.746
so it's not so strong, like,
while the person is singing.

47:09.788 --> 47:12.290
David, I love your melodies
in the hook.

47:12.332 --> 47:14.959
If you kept to the melody
earlier on,

47:15.001 --> 47:17.504
and then, when we get there,
it's kind of, like, it builds...

47:17.545 --> 47:19.089
Yeah.
...that'd be great.

47:19.130 --> 47:21.883
* On these days that feel like
you and me, yeah *

47:21.925 --> 47:25.095
David had
a really sweet tone.
* Heartbreak anniversary *

47:25.136 --> 47:28.682
It's like a higher tone for
a male within a tenor range.

47:28.723 --> 47:30.684
It was just really nice
and really pleasant.

47:30.725 --> 47:32.102
You know what I like
about you?

47:32.143 --> 47:33.728
I feel like
you're taking notes...

47:33.770 --> 47:35.438
Yes.
...and you're getting better
every time.

47:35.480 --> 47:36.564
That's
definitely true.

47:36.606 --> 47:38.024
David:
I'm just so inspired

47:38.066 --> 47:39.025
to get compliments

47:39.067 --> 47:41.069
from John and Jazmine.

47:41.111 --> 47:42.195
**

47:42.237 --> 47:43.571
But for me,

47:43.613 --> 47:45.699
it really
hasn't always been easy.

47:45.740 --> 47:49.077
When I was younger,
I was bullied and judged

47:49.119 --> 47:51.454
for being the guy

47:51.496 --> 47:53.915
that was just really
so interested in music.

47:53.957 --> 47:56.084
So, I tried to change
my style.

47:56.126 --> 47:57.460
I tried out for
the basketball team.

47:57.502 --> 47:59.629
That was ultimate fail.

47:59.671 --> 48:02.382
And to relate to
"Heartbreak Anniversary,"

48:02.424 --> 48:04.759
it's heartbreaking thinking that
I felt like

48:04.801 --> 48:08.096
that's what I needed to do
to be accepted.

48:08.138 --> 48:10.390
* Do you ever,
do you ever think of me? *
What I've learned is

48:10.432 --> 48:12.392
you always win
when you're true to yourself.

48:12.434 --> 48:13.768
* Do you ever,
do, do you ever *

48:13.810 --> 48:16.813
So, I really want to
bring that emotion...

48:16.855 --> 48:19.190
* Think of me? *
...to the stage for the song.

48:19.232 --> 48:22.110
* Yeah, oh *

48:22.152 --> 48:23.778
All right!
Whoo!

48:23.820 --> 48:26.614
Make sure y'all coordinate
that last little run.

48:26.656 --> 48:28.742
I wouldn't want you
having separate runs

48:28.783 --> 48:30.535
that are going
different directions.

48:30.577 --> 48:32.996
I'd rather you land firmly,
you know, like Simone Biles,

48:33.038 --> 48:35.790
when she, like,
land on two feet firmly.
Kim: Yeah.

48:35.832 --> 48:38.168
Just don't kind of
get in each other's way.

48:38.209 --> 48:40.295
We want to be able to hear
both of you.

48:40.337 --> 48:41.796
Kim: This is a challenge

48:41.838 --> 48:43.757
because I'm singing a guy's song
against a guy.

48:43.798 --> 48:47.177
So, John is definitely pushing
me outside of my comfort zone.

48:47.218 --> 48:48.887
Until it's battle time,

48:48.928 --> 48:51.181
David and I are gonna
work on this performance

48:51.222 --> 48:52.599
at the hotel

48:52.640 --> 48:55.101
and perfect it
to the best of our ability.

48:55.143 --> 48:57.812
* Think of me?
Yeah *

48:57.854 --> 48:59.522
Because I really,
really, really,

48:59.564 --> 49:01.900
really want to win
this battle.

49:01.941 --> 49:04.486
* Yeah *

49:04.527 --> 49:05.862
Yes!

49:05.904 --> 49:07.530
* Oh *

49:07.572 --> 49:09.949
That's the ending.
That's the ending.
Yay! Yay!

49:09.991 --> 49:12.160
Simone Biles.
Yay!

49:12.202 --> 49:13.745
Two feet on the ground.

49:13.787 --> 49:14.996
We felt that.

49:15.038 --> 49:16.247
Giveon will be proud.
Ha ha!

49:16.289 --> 49:18.166
Bring the song, baby.
Bring the song.

49:18.208 --> 49:19.584
Sing it. Whoo!

David, you did
all the flashy stuff.

You hit the big notes,
you had the personality --

everything you need
to have.

she has all of those same things
I'm talking about,

some Kim thing

on her voice

anybody else.

David, when you first
opened your mouth,

53:00.305 --> 53:01.598
I was like, "Wow.

53:01.639 --> 53:03.600
What a beautiful,
beautiful tone he has."

53:03.641 --> 53:09.439
And then, Kim came in, and this
huge dragon comes out of you.

53:09.481 --> 53:10.815

about David

is the joy
that you bring.

58:23.211 --> 58:24.796
During my senior year,

58:24.838 --> 58:27.298
my family decided to move
to Oklahoma City

58:27.340 --> 58:29.634
because my parents
are pastors.

58:29.676 --> 58:31.136
It was really hard on me.

58:31.177 --> 58:33.680
In general, like,
in high school and stuff,

58:33.722 --> 58:34.931
I was never the cool kid.

58:34.973 --> 58:36.474
I was always
the weird, shy girl.

58:36.516 --> 58:39.310
I wouldn't be able to talk
to someone at church,

58:39.352 --> 58:41.563
but then, I could stand onstage
and sing.

58:41.604 --> 58:45.358
And so, in a way, the stage
has always been safe.

58:45.400 --> 58:49.112
I think Blake will help me
because he sees something in me,

58:49.154 --> 58:50.822
and he's gonna push me

58:50.864 --> 58:53.116
to be better than I feel like
I can be.

* We both lie silently still
in the dead of the night *

59:04.252 --> 59:06.546
I gave Kate and Madison
"Every Rose Has Its Thorn"...

59:06.588 --> 59:08.840
* Although we both lie
close together *
...because
they're both storytellers

59:08.882 --> 59:10.675
and they're both soulful...
* We feel miles apart
inside *

59:10.717 --> 59:13.470
...but they've kind of both got
a foot in different areas.

59:13.511 --> 59:15.638
* Was it something I said
or something I did? *
And so that's why I've also
paired them together.

59:15.680 --> 59:17.349
* Did my words
not come out right? *

59:17.390 --> 59:19.768
"Every Rose Has Its Thorn"
is about a breakup.

59:19.809 --> 59:21.978
* Though I tried
not to hurt you *
For me, it's just how
the happiest person...

59:22.020 --> 59:23.855
* Yeah, I tried *
...is maybe really sad
on the inside.

59:23.897 --> 59:25.982
* I guess
that's why they say *
We just don't know.

59:26.024 --> 59:30.028
* Every rose has its thorn *

59:30.070 --> 59:31.821
The more I hear
Madison's voice,

59:31.863 --> 59:34.366
the more I -- I'm really
starting to become drawn to it.

59:34.407 --> 59:37.077
* Just like every night
has its dawn *

59:37.118 --> 59:39.162
* Just like every cowboy *
Her voice
is kind of like a mix

59:39.204 --> 59:42.040
between a male and female
country singer.

59:42.082 --> 59:44.668
* Sings a sad, sad song *

59:44.709 --> 59:47.003
* Every rose has its thorn *
There's parts where
I hear Reba,

59:47.045 --> 59:48.630
then there's parts
where I hear Garth Brooks.

59:48.672 --> 59:51.216
I love her tone, especially when
she's in that lower register.

59:51.257 --> 59:53.259
* Every cowboy
sings a sad, sad song *

59:53.301 --> 59:54.594
I knew Kate
was a great singer.

59:54.636 --> 59:57.347
I mean,
her tone is like nobody else's.

59:57.389 --> 1:00:00.058
And I want to explore her
falsetto even more if we can.

1:00:00.100 --> 1:00:01.685
* Every rose has its thorn *

1:00:01.726 --> 1:00:03.186
I like Kate's approach.

1:00:03.228 --> 1:00:05.397
When she sings and she hits
those bigger notes...

1:00:05.438 --> 1:00:09.984
* Every rose has its thorn *
...it's some sort of
innocent power, innocent passion

1:00:10.026 --> 1:00:11.611
that she has
to what she's doing.

1:00:11.653 --> 1:00:12.946
Well, what do you think?

1:00:12.987 --> 1:00:14.406
There was definitely a part
where, like,

1:00:14.447 --> 1:00:16.241
you were going for a note.
Yeah, I'm like, "Uh!"

1:00:16.282 --> 1:00:18.118
You hit it eventually,
but just go for it.
I know.

1:00:18.159 --> 1:00:19.994
'Cause you got to it.
Blake: If you can
get to that place,

1:00:20.036 --> 1:00:21.871
that note
that he's talking about,

1:00:21.913 --> 1:00:23.832
and -- and you feel
comfortable getting there.
Madison: Right.

1:00:23.873 --> 1:00:25.333
But if you feel like it...
Yeah.

1:00:25.375 --> 1:00:27.877
...is vocally something
that's gonna derail you...

1:00:27.919 --> 1:00:29.629
Right.
...I would never want you

1:00:29.671 --> 1:00:30.922
to do
something like that.

1:00:30.964 --> 1:00:32.549
There's a balance.

1:00:32.590 --> 1:00:34.759
Everyone else here has had a lot
of practice performing live.

1:00:34.801 --> 1:00:38.388
I'm not that used to putting
myself out here on this level.

1:00:38.430 --> 1:00:40.724
This is nothing compared to,
like, high-school auditoriums,

where we would do talent shows.

1:00:42.183 --> 1:00:44.269
I was, like, feeling very proud
of my performance

1:00:44.310 --> 1:00:46.062
on the blind audition stage.

1:00:47.313 --> 1:00:48.898
towards the end,
and I'm just like, "Wow."

1:00:48.940 --> 1:00:52.360
Like, they all really did see
that special thing in me.

1:00:54.487 --> 1:00:57.073

me to believe in myself a lot.

to see other people

that don't even know who I am,

1:01:04.456 --> 1:01:07.542

in me.

a great coach for me

of my own head and be myself.

we can blend together.

1:09:24.581 --> 1:09:25.749
Thank you, everyone.

1:09:25.790 --> 1:09:27.250
Give it up
for Madison Hughes.

1:09:27.292 --> 1:09:29.502
[ Cheers and applause ]
John: Great job, Madison.

1:09:29.544 --> 1:09:31.129
Gwen: Great job.

1:09:31.171 --> 1:09:32.922
Great job.

1:09:32.964 --> 1:09:34.591
Do you want me to have them
write you some jokes?

1:09:34.632 --> 1:09:35.759
I mean, it's the crowd.

1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:38.887
Something in this crowd.
I don't know.

1:09:38.928 --> 1:09:41.097
Do y'all think
she's funny?

1:09:41.139 --> 1:09:42.682
No?

1:09:42.724 --> 1:09:44.100
You do?

1:09:44.142 --> 1:09:45.393
Are you in her fan club,
though?

1:09:45.435 --> 1:09:46.686
That doesn't count.

1:09:46.728 --> 1:09:48.188
That does not count.

1:09:48.229 --> 1:09:49.230
Thanks. Thank you.

1:09:49.272 --> 1:09:50.857
I'm having a bit
of an off day today.

1:09:50.899 --> 1:09:52.901
I might be trying too hard or --
or not trying enough.

1:09:52.942 --> 1:09:54.694
I don't know.
She needs a drink, I think.

1:09:54.736 --> 1:09:56.613
Yeah, I might.

* This is "The Voice" *

1:10:03.119 --> 1:10:05.080
Daly:
Welcome back to "The Voice."

1:10:05.121 --> 1:10:07.207
Blake, does it help
when the other coaches

1:10:07.248 --> 1:10:09.167
are giving their opinions
about one of your battles?

1:10:09.209 --> 1:10:10.919
Do you listen to what
they have to say?

1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:12.796
Especially whenever
it's exactly in line

1:10:12.837 --> 1:10:14.089
with what I'm already thinking.

1:10:14.130 --> 1:10:15.924
When it's not,
I don't listen.

1:10:15.965 --> 1:10:18.927
I only take advice that agrees
exactly with my...

1:10:18.968 --> 1:10:21.179
So it's both of you.
Gwen, how about you?

1:10:21.221 --> 1:10:23.765
They have swayed me
so many times,

1:10:23.807 --> 1:10:25.725
like, to -- to the point
where I'm like,

1:10:25.767 --> 1:10:27.560
"I think
John's trying to sabotage me."

1:10:27.602 --> 1:10:28.937
I'm not that conniving.
Yeah.

1:10:28.978 --> 1:10:30.313
I'm truly just honest.
That's very conniving.

1:10:30.355 --> 1:10:32.232
I really am. I promise.
I believe that.

1:10:32.273 --> 1:10:34.025
That's what liars say, too,
though, so...

1:10:34.067 --> 1:10:35.568
[ Laughter ]
Yeah.

Man on P.A.:

1:10:39.823 --> 1:10:42.158
Alyssa:
Being here for the battles
is, like, absolutely insane

1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:44.828
'cause I didn't even think
that I would, like, be here.

1:10:44.869 --> 1:10:46.413
I definitely hope to win,

1:10:46.454 --> 1:10:48.331
and I hope that I get
to the knockout round.

1:10:48.373 --> 1:10:51.418
That's something that would be
such a great accomplishment.

1:10:51.459 --> 1:10:53.461
Ian: Of course I'm nervous
going against Alyssa.

1:10:53.503 --> 1:10:56.297
I mean, she's a very talented
vocalist and performer,

1:10:56.339 --> 1:10:59.300
but competing to go to
the knockouts feels incredible

1:10:59.342 --> 1:11:02.095
and, like, a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

1:11:03.930 --> 1:11:05.765
I just get fascinated
to think of you

1:11:05.807 --> 1:11:08.476
as a -- a young boy
growing up in Jamaica.

1:11:08.518 --> 1:11:09.936
Listening to Bob Marley.

1:11:09.978 --> 1:11:11.563
I would never imagine
that me and you

1:11:11.604 --> 1:11:14.399
would be sitting on
"The Voice" coaching together.

1:11:14.441 --> 1:11:15.900
Neither me.
I was like, "Wait a minute."

1:11:15.942 --> 1:11:17.652
Like, what in God's earth?

1:11:17.694 --> 1:11:20.363
Thank you, God.
Hey, hey. Hey, big guy.

1:11:20.405 --> 1:11:23.158
Thank you.
We get to have Ian and Alyssa.

1:11:23.199 --> 1:11:25.493
Alyssa actually sang
"Don't Speak."

1:11:25.535 --> 1:11:27.495
[ Whispering ] She's talking
about me, Miss Gwen.
She is.

1:11:27.537 --> 1:11:29.080
[ Breathes sharply ] Yeah.

1:11:29.122 --> 1:11:31.541
I'm having a fan girl moment
right now. I'm, like, shaking.

1:11:31.583 --> 1:11:33.668
Ian just has a, like, a lot of
style in his voice, so...

1:11:33.710 --> 1:11:35.211
Hi!

1:11:35.253 --> 1:11:36.671
Hi, guys!
Hi!

1:11:36.713 --> 1:11:38.506
Oh, my God!
Sean Paul to the rescue!

1:11:38.548 --> 1:11:40.050
Sean: Hey. What's up?
Hi.

1:11:40.091 --> 1:11:44.012
Sean Paul. He has done
so many collaborations

1:11:44.054 --> 1:11:45.680
with so many different artists.

1:11:45.722 --> 1:11:47.891
He knows everybody.
He's so cool.

1:11:47.932 --> 1:11:50.018
Alyssa, thank you
for doing my song.

1:11:50.060 --> 1:11:52.145
No, you don't understand.

1:11:52.187 --> 1:11:54.022
Like, I remember listening
to that song

1:11:54.064 --> 1:11:55.774
as a kid and being like,
"Oh, my God,

1:11:55.815 --> 1:11:57.233
like, what if I just, like,
sang the song?"

1:11:57.275 --> 1:12:00.111
And then, like, I sing it
for you, of all people?

1:12:00.153 --> 1:12:02.197
* We used to be together *

1:12:02.238 --> 1:12:03.865
Oh, my God,
that's so weird.

1:12:03.907 --> 1:12:05.492
* Every day together *
I have to press.

1:12:05.533 --> 1:12:07.118
Oh, got two right away!
* Always *

1:12:07.160 --> 1:12:10.121
Getting two chair turns,
almost immediately, too --

1:12:10.163 --> 1:12:12.040
That's something
that I will never forget.

1:12:12.082 --> 1:12:14.084
You're, like,
the perfect, ideal

1:12:14.125 --> 1:12:15.126
dream girl
to work with,

1:12:15.168 --> 1:12:16.586
so there's that.
Gwen!

1:12:16.628 --> 1:12:17.754
Gwen has been, like,

1:12:17.796 --> 1:12:19.047
one of my heroes
growing up.

1:12:19.089 --> 1:12:20.924
Now she's my coach.
[ Squeals ]

1:12:20.965 --> 1:12:22.884
Ian, you have so much style
in your voice

1:12:22.926 --> 1:12:24.302
and personality.
Thank you.

1:12:24.344 --> 1:12:25.804
I think
you were the first one

1:12:25.845 --> 1:12:27.389
to get on my team, right?
I was. Yeah.

1:12:27.430 --> 1:12:31.685
* Take me back
to the night we met *

1:12:31.726 --> 1:12:33.311
I got three chairs to turn.

1:12:33.353 --> 1:12:35.355
I could not believe it. It was
one of the best days of my life.

1:12:35.397 --> 1:12:37.148
* Oh, take me back
to the night we met *

1:12:37.190 --> 1:12:39.025
It is wild that I'm performing
for millions of people

1:12:39.067 --> 1:12:40.360
on national television,

1:12:40.402 --> 1:12:42.195
mainly because
I am 20 years old.
Yes!

1:12:42.237 --> 1:12:44.531
I'm a college student,
and I work at a bar full time,

1:12:44.572 --> 1:12:46.533
and that's usually
just to pay my bills.

1:12:46.574 --> 1:12:48.576
A barback is a person
who does everything

1:12:48.618 --> 1:12:49.994
that the bartenders don't.

1:12:50.036 --> 1:12:52.288
They do the glassware,
they stock the shelves,

1:12:52.330 --> 1:12:55.792
fill up ice containers,
clean bathrooms, bus tables.

1:12:55.834 --> 1:12:58.086
It's an incredibly tough job.

1:12:58.128 --> 1:12:59.504
And to compare it to singing,

1:12:59.546 --> 1:13:01.256
it's the same sense
of accomplishment,

1:13:01.297 --> 1:13:02.716
especially with this battle.

1:13:02.757 --> 1:13:04.092
Like, I know that
it's gonna be hard.

1:13:04.134 --> 1:13:05.635
I know that
it's gonna be tough.

1:13:05.677 --> 1:13:07.470
But I know at the end of it,
I'm gonna come out feeling

1:13:07.512 --> 1:13:09.264
really good and hopefully moving
on to the knockout rounds.

1:13:09.305 --> 1:13:12.934
* When I'm away
from you *

1:13:12.976 --> 1:13:16.438
Gwen: I gave them "Happier
Than Ever" by Billie Eilish...
* I'm happier than ever *

1:13:16.479 --> 1:13:19.524
...because I think they both
have quirky, stylistic voices.

1:13:19.566 --> 1:13:21.276
* Wish that
I could explain it better *

1:13:21.317 --> 1:13:23.361
Sean:
Ian's voice, it stands out,

1:13:23.403 --> 1:13:26.239
and it -- and it gives --
adds character to the song.
* I wish it wasn't true *

1:13:26.281 --> 1:13:29.784
And that's always something
that catches people, you know.

1:13:29.826 --> 1:13:33.872
* Give me a day or two *

1:13:33.913 --> 1:13:36.458
Gwen: Alyssa has the whole,
total package.
* To think
of something clever *

1:13:36.499 --> 1:13:39.794
She's absolutely cute.
She has style.

1:13:39.836 --> 1:13:42.255
* To write myself a letter *
She has so much personality.

1:13:42.297 --> 1:13:44.632
I really,
really was impressed with her.

1:13:44.674 --> 1:13:46.968
* To tell me what to do *

1:13:47.010 --> 1:13:48.470
Alyssa:
I absolutely love the song.

1:13:48.511 --> 1:13:51.139
The things that she sang,
I've totally felt.

1:13:51.181 --> 1:13:53.016
There was a point
in my current relationship

1:13:53.058 --> 1:13:54.476
with my boyfriend,
who I love very much,

1:13:54.517 --> 1:13:56.686
where I felt like
I wasn't being heard enough.

1:13:56.728 --> 1:14:00.148
It was frustrating,
but we just started to open up

1:14:00.190 --> 1:14:02.192
more to each other
and communicate better.

1:14:02.233 --> 1:14:03.818
I think we needed to go
through that rough patch

1:14:03.860 --> 1:14:07.405
to get to where we are now
'cause it's better than ever.

1:14:07.447 --> 1:14:09.407
He's known, like,
since I've met him

1:14:09.449 --> 1:14:11.659
that this is all
I've ever wanted to do.

1:14:11.701 --> 1:14:15.163
So I know that he's always
my number-one supporter.

1:14:15.205 --> 1:14:17.665
I think the beginning
of the song is the place

1:14:17.707 --> 1:14:20.001
we're probably gonna have
to work on because...
Oh, yeah.

1:14:20.043 --> 1:14:22.504
...this is the thing
about, like, Billie Eilish.

1:14:22.545 --> 1:14:24.506
It's almost whispering
in the first part, huh?

1:14:24.547 --> 1:14:25.840
It's more staccato, too.

1:14:25.882 --> 1:14:27.384
Like, it's not --
It's shorter.

1:14:27.425 --> 1:14:31.179
* When I'm away from you *
* Away from you *

1:14:31.221 --> 1:14:33.181
Her lyric is so amazing

1:14:33.223 --> 1:14:36.393
'cause she's talking about
that she is screwed up

1:14:36.434 --> 1:14:38.353
and she needs to, like,
deal with herself. Right?
Oh, yeah.

1:14:38.395 --> 1:14:41.314
And so that quirkiness
and that weirdness,

1:14:41.356 --> 1:14:45.026
you need to let that theater
and personality come out.

1:14:45.068 --> 1:14:47.696
Bring us to the --
the stadium.

1:14:47.737 --> 1:14:49.114
100%.

1:14:49.155 --> 1:14:50.782
Being in front of
two very big names in music

1:14:50.824 --> 1:14:52.826
was honestly surreal.
* You were my everything *

1:14:52.867 --> 1:14:54.536
* All that you did
was make me frickin' sad *

1:14:54.577 --> 1:14:57.247
But also it was
incredibly intimidating.

1:14:57.288 --> 1:15:01.042
It's definitely a situation
I have to get over.
Alyssa:
* You ruined everything good *

1:15:01.084 --> 1:15:02.419
I hope to make myself stand out

1:15:02.460 --> 1:15:04.629
by incorporating
a lot of my emotion into this.

1:15:04.671 --> 1:15:06.756
* Always said
you were misunderstood *

1:15:06.798 --> 1:15:08.341
And so I'm gonna go home.
* Made all my moments
your own *

1:15:08.383 --> 1:15:10.260
And I'm really gonna work
the kinks out

1:15:10.301 --> 1:15:12.012
and figure out what I need
to do better.

1:15:12.053 --> 1:15:17.350
* Just can you leave me alone? *

1:15:17.392 --> 1:15:19.394
Gwen: I wanted to give them
an opportunity

1:15:19.436 --> 1:15:21.980
to really let their
personalities come through.

1:15:22.022 --> 1:15:23.606
And it's not easy to do.

1:15:23.648 --> 1:15:25.150
* Mmm *

1:15:25.191 --> 1:15:27.610
So it's definitely
gonna be a hard song.

1:15:27.652 --> 1:15:32.323
I'm looking for a saturated
version of your personality

1:15:32.365 --> 1:15:34.409
to come through,
like, your style,

1:15:34.451 --> 1:15:37.579
and it's -- it's gonna be a lot
to do with not just the voice.

1:15:37.620 --> 1:15:39.164
Yeah.
It's gonna be to do
with your facial expressions.

1:15:39.205 --> 1:15:41.041
Your mannerisms, yeah.
Yeah.

1:15:41.082 --> 1:15:43.043
Let those lyrics
guide your body.

1:15:43.084 --> 1:15:44.419
Thank you so much.

1:15:44.461 --> 1:15:45.837
It means the world
coming from you guys.

1:15:45.879 --> 1:15:48.590
Like, you giving us compliments
is, like, insane.

1:15:48.631 --> 1:15:51.384
There's two singers with two
different styles of voices

1:15:51.426 --> 1:15:53.094
and different styles of singing.

1:15:53.136 --> 1:15:55.096
Gwen is in trouble again, man.
She's putting --

1:15:55.138 --> 1:15:56.973
She likes to put herself
in trouble here.

1:15:57.015 --> 1:15:58.224

1:17:08.920 --> 1:17:14.050
* To write myself a letter *

1:17:14.092 --> 1:17:18.930
* To tell me what to do *

1:17:18.972 --> 1:17:19.973
Whoo!

1:17:20.015 --> 1:17:24.060
* Mm-mmm *

1:17:24.102 --> 1:17:25.562
Goody.

1:17:27.647 --> 1:17:29.691
Yes!

1:17:29.733 --> 1:17:34.195
* You call me again,
drunk in your Benz

1:17:34.237 --> 1:17:38.408
* Driving home
under the influence *

1:17:38.450 --> 1:17:42.829
* You scared me to death,
but I'm wasting my breath *

1:17:42.871 --> 1:17:46.583
* 'Cause you only listen
to your stupid friends *

1:17:46.624 --> 1:17:51.004
* I don't relate to you *

1:17:51.046 --> 1:17:54.132
* I don't relate to you, no *

1:17:54.174 --> 1:17:58.595
* 'Cause I'd never treat me
this badly *

1:17:58.636 --> 1:18:00.764
* You made me hate
this city *

1:18:00.805 --> 1:18:02.891
Hey! Hey!

1:18:02.932 --> 1:18:07.645
* And I don't talk crap
about you on the Internet *

1:18:07.687 --> 1:18:11.691
* Never told anyone
anything bad *

1:18:11.733 --> 1:18:14.444
'Cause that's just
embarrassing *

1:18:14.486 --> 1:18:16.488
* You were my everything *

1:18:16.529 --> 1:18:22.369
* All that you did
was make me frickin' sad *

1:18:22.410 --> 1:18:25.497
* You ruined
everything good *

1:18:25.538 --> 1:18:31.086
* Always said
you were misunderstood *

1:18:31.127 --> 1:18:35.298
* Made all my moments
your own *

1:18:35.340 --> 1:18:40.845
* Just can you leave me alone? *

1:18:40.887 --> 1:18:42.597
Hey!

1:18:42.639 --> 1:18:44.808
Hey!

1:18:48.687 --> 1:18:54.901
* Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh *

1:18:58.738 --> 1:19:02.784
* Ahh *

1:19:02.826 --> 1:19:03.910
Yes!

1:19:03.952 --> 1:19:06.788
[ Cheers and applause ]

1:19:06.830 --> 1:19:07.872
Wow.

1:19:09.457 --> 1:19:12.293
Whoo! Whoo-whoo-whoo!

1:19:12.335 --> 1:19:14.337
Oh, my goodness.

1:19:14.379 --> 1:19:17.298
I loved that.
That was so good.

1:19:17.340 --> 1:19:19.592
You both are
so freaking cool.

1:19:19.634 --> 1:19:22.178
[ Laughs ]
Seriously.

1:19:22.220 --> 1:19:23.680
When you walked out,

1:19:23.722 --> 1:19:26.850
I was telling Gwen how I loved
both of your outfit choices.

1:19:26.891 --> 1:19:28.184
You look like stars.

1:19:28.226 --> 1:19:30.729
And, Ian, I love that depth
in your voice,

1:19:30.770 --> 1:19:35.650
and it's just so, like, full
and has such presence.

1:19:35.692 --> 1:19:37.652
It felt like the song
wasn't too big for you.

1:19:37.694 --> 1:19:39.446
You were there
to dominate the song.

1:19:39.487 --> 1:19:41.364
Alyssa,
you were pretty much flawless.

1:19:41.406 --> 1:19:43.033
Your voice sounded amazing.

1:19:43.074 --> 1:19:46.161
Your tone was perfect
for the song.

1:19:46.202 --> 1:19:47.537
I would pick Alyssa only

1:19:47.579 --> 1:19:50.707
because the song was just
right in her wheelhouse.

1:19:50.749 --> 1:19:52.584
But both of you
are just really good,

1:19:52.625 --> 1:19:54.044
and I really enjoyed you both.

1:19:54.085 --> 1:19:56.546
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1:19:56.588 --> 1:19:59.215
I felt like Alyssa stayed
in her lane the entire time.

1:19:59.257 --> 1:20:00.800
And Ian,
at first I thought,

1:20:00.842 --> 1:20:02.594
"Oh, my God, he's gonna be
stuck down there in that --"

1:20:02.635 --> 1:20:05.555
Mm-hmm.
"...in that lower register
the entire time."

1:20:05.597 --> 1:20:07.849
But then the bridge
happened.

1:20:07.891 --> 1:20:09.392
He went, "Rah!"
And that's...

1:20:09.434 --> 1:20:11.644
that's when
you got the big reaction

1:20:11.686 --> 1:20:13.188
out of the room.
She's right.

1:20:13.229 --> 1:20:16.399
We all felt that. I got to see
two different versions

1:20:16.441 --> 1:20:18.026
of Ian up there, you know,

1:20:18.068 --> 1:20:21.613
and they were both really good,
and the shock factor of that

1:20:21.654 --> 1:20:23.406
is the reason
that I'd be picking Ian

1:20:23.448 --> 1:20:25.241
based on what I just heard
in that moment.

1:20:25.283 --> 1:20:27.702
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1:20:27.744 --> 1:20:30.205
Guys, it's going down
right now.

1:20:30.246 --> 1:20:32.082
Yes, it went down.

1:20:32.123 --> 1:20:36.378
It went down. If I had to pick,
I would say Alyssa,

1:20:36.419 --> 1:20:38.088
just because I think
performance-wise,

1:20:38.129 --> 1:20:40.965
from the beginning to the end,
you just kept blowing my mind.

1:20:41.007 --> 1:20:43.176
Like, I was just like,
"I'm about to just go start

1:20:43.218 --> 1:20:45.845
a Twitter fan account
for this girl."
Mm-hmm.

1:20:45.887 --> 1:20:48.098
I'll just, like, be right back.
I'll just be like,

1:20:48.139 --> 1:20:50.725
"AlyssaStanNumber13."

1:20:50.767 --> 1:20:52.769
[ Laughter ]
AlyssaStan13.

1:20:52.811 --> 1:20:54.938
But, Ian, I think that
with the right song,

1:20:54.979 --> 1:20:59.109
I could start a fan account
that's like IanLover105.

1:20:59.150 --> 1:21:02.445
[ Laughter ]

1:21:02.487 --> 1:21:03.947
Daly: Thank you, Coaches.
Alyssa: Thank you.

1:21:03.988 --> 1:21:07.075
Ah, my gosh. Ahh!

1:21:07.117 --> 1:21:08.785
All right, Gwen.
You have the final decision.

1:21:08.827 --> 1:21:11.287
Give us some thoughts first
and then tell us who won.

1:21:11.329 --> 1:21:12.455
Okay, Carson Daly.

1:21:12.497 --> 1:21:13.873
Okay.
This is the thing.

1:21:13.915 --> 1:21:16.960
Ian,
your kind of voice for a male

1:21:17.002 --> 1:21:18.586
is -- is my favorite
kind of voice.

1:21:18.628 --> 1:21:20.380
And you have so much range.

1:21:20.422 --> 1:21:21.715
When you went to
your high notes,

1:21:21.756 --> 1:21:24.217
it was as good
as any alternative singer.

1:21:24.259 --> 1:21:25.844
I'm a super-fan
of what you do.

1:21:25.885 --> 1:21:28.388
Alyssa, I think I want to be you
when I grow up.

1:21:28.430 --> 1:21:30.473
So that's --
that's the problem.

1:21:30.515 --> 1:21:32.434
You know, I think --
I want to be you.

1:21:32.475 --> 1:21:34.728
[ Laughs ] I mean,
you did "Don't Speak."

1:21:34.769 --> 1:21:36.479
It was
the first time probably

1:21:36.521 --> 1:21:38.064
in my entire career
that I was like,

1:21:38.106 --> 1:21:40.442
"Actually, that was pretty good.
Like, I thought she was...

1:21:40.483 --> 1:21:42.986
I liked that."
This is really hard for me.

1:21:43.028 --> 1:21:45.572
I don't know what to do
at this point, Carson Daly.

1:21:45.613 --> 1:21:46.906
I really don't.

1:21:46.948 --> 1:21:49.576
I really don't
and, honestly, did not...

1:21:49.617 --> 1:21:51.828
You pick, Carson Daly.
I'll tell you, 100%,

1:21:51.870 --> 1:21:53.496
where I'm leaning right now

1:21:53.538 --> 1:21:55.749
was not what I thought
I was gonna do today.

1:21:55.790 --> 1:21:57.917
I mean, absolutely did not know
this was gonna happen, but...

1:21:57.959 --> 1:22:00.003
Oh, my goodness.
Daly: Well,
it's a tough decision, Gwen.

1:22:00.045 --> 1:22:01.504
The suspense.

1:22:01.546 --> 1:22:03.840
But the time has come. Who is
the winner of this battle?

1:22:03.882 --> 1:22:06.051
Don't be mad at me, guys.
I love you both.

1:22:06.092 --> 1:22:08.595
And I think you're
both super-gifted.

1:22:08.636 --> 1:22:11.556
You have a future.
Keep loving music.

1:22:11.598 --> 1:22:13.266
Keep being honest
with your music

1:22:13.308 --> 1:22:16.853
and do it
for the right reason.

1:22:16.895 --> 1:22:20.607
I'm going to say that Alyssa
won the battle.

1:22:20.648 --> 1:22:24.069
Alyssa, congratulations.

1:22:24.110 --> 1:22:26.404
You're moving on to the
knockouts for Team Gwen.

1:22:26.446 --> 1:22:28.365
Come here! Give me a hug!

1:22:28.406 --> 1:22:30.575
[ Cheers and applause ]

1:22:30.617 --> 1:22:32.952
You sliced it.
I wanna -- I wanna cry
with Gwen.

1:22:32.994 --> 1:22:33.912
You did so good.

1:22:33.953 --> 1:22:35.538
Gwen: I ended up
going with Alyssa

1:22:35.580 --> 1:22:39.959
because I think that she
has such stage presence.

1:22:40.001 --> 1:22:43.046
I'm excited to see how far
she comes on the show.

1:22:43.088 --> 1:22:45.715
She's very likable.
She's very lovable, actually,

1:22:45.757 --> 1:22:47.759
and
she's kind of a full package.

1:22:47.801 --> 1:22:50.929
I want to show that she made
the right decision in picking me

1:22:50.970 --> 1:22:53.306
and that I'm gonna go
super-far in this competition

1:22:53.348 --> 1:22:57.185
and it's gonna all work out
as well as it's supposed to.

1:22:57.227 --> 1:22:58.937
I can't -- I'm so sorry.

1:22:58.978 --> 1:23:01.106
I'm, like,
hyped up on emotions right now.

1:23:01.147 --> 1:23:03.066
Coaches, let me remind you
that Ian is available

1:23:03.108 --> 1:23:04.776
to steal or save.

1:23:04.818 --> 1:23:06.236
Ian, anything you want
to say to Gwen?

1:23:06.277 --> 1:23:07.946
Ah, this is so hard!

1:23:07.987 --> 1:23:09.572
I mean, thank you so much
for this opportunity. This is --

1:23:09.614 --> 1:23:11.241
[ Whoosh ]
Oh, my God!

1:23:11.282 --> 1:23:12.534
Daly:
That's the sound of a steal!
Get outta here!

1:23:12.575 --> 1:23:14.744
From John Legend!
Oh, my God!

1:23:14.786 --> 1:23:17.789
By John?!
[ Laughs ]

1:23:17.831 --> 1:23:22.669
John wastes no time
to steal Ian.

1:23:22.711 --> 1:23:24.295
Wow. Oh, my God.
Wow!

1:23:24.337 --> 1:23:26.172
That's -- That's amazing.

1:23:26.214 --> 1:23:27.340
Talk to us, John.

1:23:27.382 --> 1:23:29.843
Ian's from my hometown,
my home area.

1:23:29.884 --> 1:23:33.263
Aww.
And it's time to come on home,
Ian.

1:23:33.304 --> 1:23:34.764
I love that.

1:23:34.806 --> 1:23:36.683
I really love your voice.
And I loved you in the blinds.

1:23:36.725 --> 1:23:38.518
And I would love to have
you on my team, Ian. I
think you're fantastic.

1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:40.103
Wow.
How's that work
for you, Ian?

1:23:40.145 --> 1:23:42.772
I mean, this is so exciting.
Thank you so much.

1:23:42.814 --> 1:23:46.609
John steals Ian Harrison
from Team Gwen.

1:23:46.651 --> 1:23:50.113
We'll see you in the knockdowns
with your new coach.
Come on.

1:23:50.155 --> 1:23:52.115
So good. Great.
Thank you so much.

1:23:52.157 --> 1:23:54.617
I'm so excited.
I love the fact
that he's from Ohio.

1:23:54.659 --> 1:23:56.536
I follow him
on almost every social media

1:23:56.578 --> 1:23:57.871
because I think he's incredible.

1:23:57.912 --> 1:23:59.706
Welcome to Team Legend, buddy.
Oh, my gosh.

1:23:59.748 --> 1:24:01.124
We got to get you
a new jacket.
Dude.

1:24:01.166 --> 1:24:03.209
A new Legend jacket.
We -- We really do.

Let's do it.
