WEBVTT

00:01.376 --> 00:03.003
Look, Miles, I think
you know my story.

00:03.003 --> 00:05.130
If I just had some cash, I could
maybe get some treatment

00:05.130 --> 00:08.675
<i>to buy me more time and,
uh, maybe see my son be born.</i>

00:08.675 --> 00:10.886
I am what you would call
a facilitator.

00:10.886 --> 00:13.096
<i>I represent a very exclusive,</i>

00:13.096 --> 00:17.809
<i>very wealthy clientele
who pay exorbitant fees</i>

00:17.809 --> 00:20.187
for a unique,
one-of-a-kind experience

00:20.187 --> 00:22.439
in a highly intense sport--

00:22.439 --> 00:24.775
- hunting.
- You'd want them to hunt me?

00:24.775 --> 00:26.527
<i>Like you'd hunt an animal?</i>

00:26.527 --> 00:28.445
<i>MILES:
A sport in its purest form--</i>

00:28.445 --> 00:29.696
a hunt to kill.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.115
[grunting]
<i>MILES: It's a 24-hour hunt.</i>

00:32.115 --> 00:33.825
<i>Every hour you survive,
the more money</i>

00:33.825 --> 00:36.078
<i>is being wired
into your bank account.</i>

00:36.078 --> 00:38.580
<i>And that continues
until the game ends.</i>

00:38.580 --> 00:41.166
<i>If you survive the day,
you walk away rich.</i>

00:41.166 --> 00:43.794
<i>You don't,
you die a few weeks earlier</i>

00:43.794 --> 00:45.921
<i>than you would have anyway,
but you leave</i>

00:45.921 --> 00:47.005
<i>your family set for life.</i>

00:47.005 --> 00:48.590
<i>Your husband</i>

00:48.590 --> 00:49.675
turned out to be tougher prey

00:49.675 --> 00:51.176
than we're used to.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.011
Prey?

00:53.011 --> 00:54.638
<i>DODGE:
You set me up.</i>

00:54.638 --> 00:56.598
Now I'm hunting you.

00:56.598 --> 00:57.975
<i>CONNELL:
The investors are aware.</i>

00:57.975 --> 00:59.685
That puts us all at risk.

00:59.685 --> 01:02.062
In the 2,000 years
since these games began,

01:02.062 --> 01:03.605
<i>we have never ceased</i>

01:03.605 --> 01:05.065
a game prior to conclusion,

01:05.065 --> 01:06.942
and I'm not about
to have the history

01:06.942 --> 01:10.279
of what's been built
over millennia die on my watch.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.622
[siren wailing]

01:23.709 --> 01:26.712
[dramatic, pulsing music plays]

01:38.599 --> 01:40.767
So, do we have our runner?

01:40.767 --> 01:42.019
[chuckles]

01:42.019 --> 01:44.062
We're spoiled for choice.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.148
Our scouts have done
such an incredible job.

01:46.148 --> 01:48.150
I believe I have the next three,

01:48.150 --> 01:50.194
four runners
in my hands right now.

01:50.194 --> 01:52.070
I'm glad to hear that,

01:52.070 --> 01:57.367
because we have brought in
multiple new investors.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.828
We've approved a group in Dubai

01:59.828 --> 02:01.663
to purchase futures on winnings

02:01.663 --> 02:04.208
of some
of our more established hunters,

02:04.208 --> 02:07.920
and a sportsman in China just
cleared vetting and is willing

02:07.920 --> 02:10.464
to pay top dollar
to participate in our event.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.466
Ah, this is wonderful news.

02:12.466 --> 02:16.678
So, we can't have any more
issues like in Detroit--

02:16.678 --> 02:21.016
like hunters
coming after you personally,

02:21.016 --> 02:24.144
the taking
of a civilian hostage.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.562
It was an anomaly.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.190
It was a mistake,

02:28.190 --> 02:30.817
and mistakes have fathers,

02:30.817 --> 02:33.737
and the board can't
let it happen twice.

02:33.737 --> 02:37.157
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

02:41.286 --> 02:43.288
Yup.

02:45.415 --> 02:48.085
I have much reading to get to.

02:55.050 --> 02:57.928
TINA: Career petty criminal
Gary Glenn went viral

02:57.928 --> 03:00.389
nine months ago
after he punched a clerk

03:00.389 --> 03:03.809
during a failed shoplifting
in Van Nuys, California.

03:03.809 --> 03:07.229
12 police cruisers,
two helicopters,

03:07.229 --> 03:09.731
and it still took 28 minutes
and eight seconds

03:09.731 --> 03:14.069
to apprehend him, running nearly
half an hour at full throttle.

03:14.069 --> 03:16.280
Forensics found something
particularly interesting.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.156
FORENSICS EXPERT: Yes,
we calculated distance traveled,

03:18.156 --> 03:19.783
and we and were able
to determine

03:19.783 --> 03:23.287
that the subject's last mile
was faster than his first.

03:23.287 --> 03:26.206
He didn't just survive
under pressure. He thrived.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.418
He is currently out on parole.

03:29.418 --> 03:32.754
No job. He panhandles
on Ventura and sleeps at a YMCA.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.506
But our psych division believes

03:34.506 --> 03:36.383
he could be motivated
to participate

03:36.383 --> 03:38.635
not just by money but by ego.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.471
That's correct. A look
at Mr. Glenn's criminal record

03:41.471 --> 03:44.433
and school files indicate
malignant grandiose narcissism.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.018
To not participate in the game

03:46.018 --> 03:47.519
would be to admit
he's not superior to others,

03:47.519 --> 03:49.146
something he simply can't do.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.773
Thanks, Dr. Martell.
I heard quite enough.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.985
In fact, I should have
interrupted this presentation

03:54.985 --> 03:56.945
after the first ten words.

03:56.945 --> 04:00.407
Tina, do you remember
your first ten words?

04:00.407 --> 04:02.784
Um, uh, yes, of course.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.828
Um, uh, "this video

04:04.828 --> 04:07.748
of career petty criminal
Gary Glenn went viral"?

04:07.748 --> 04:09.166
Yeah. "Went viral."

04:09.166 --> 04:10.709
Why would I want a runner

04:10.709 --> 04:12.586
that millions of people
have seen on YouTube?

04:12.586 --> 04:16.173
Why would I want such a
participant in a secretive game?

04:16.173 --> 04:17.883
We have considered that.

04:17.883 --> 04:19.885
You see,
the news cycle is so fast,

04:19.885 --> 04:22.012
and the human attention span
is so limited,

04:22.012 --> 04:25.224
we're confident that risk
of Glenn's dubious notoriety

04:25.224 --> 04:26.975
interfering
with the game is minimal.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.644
Our tech division has been
scrubbing the video

04:28.644 --> 04:30.437
from the Internet.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.897
I mean, views have fallen
to almost negligible numbers.

04:31.897 --> 04:34.900
"Almost negligible"
is not negligible.

04:34.900 --> 04:38.862
Respectfully, sir, Gary
Glenn is a fantastic candidate--

04:38.862 --> 04:41.823
from his physical attributes
to his psychological profile.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.409
To dismiss him out of hand
would be foolish.

04:46.745 --> 04:49.748
[dramatic, ominous music plays]

05:01.385 --> 05:03.303
Tina,
how long have you been with me?

05:03.303 --> 05:04.763
Eight years.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.598
Yeah, because I saw
potential in you.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.767
We both know
you're better than this.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.770
I have an auction coming up
in a week and no product.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.230
Where are the runner-ups?

05:18.694 --> 05:20.612
25 very solid candidates.

05:20.612 --> 05:23.532
Yeah. I'll determine that.

05:23.532 --> 05:26.243
[door opens]

05:26.243 --> 05:28.996
[horn honks]

05:30.914 --> 05:33.250
[groans softly]

05:47.431 --> 05:50.767
Victor Suero,
what are you all about?

05:58.275 --> 06:00.861
[audience clamoring]

06:02.237 --> 06:03.322
JOSIE:
Let's go, Victor! Let's go!

06:03.322 --> 06:05.240
Move your feet!
Move your feet!

06:06.074 --> 06:07.868
[grunting]

06:13.957 --> 06:16.043
- Drive your hips!
- [grunting]

06:18.128 --> 06:19.421
Cover up, cover up.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.257
[grunting]

06:23.592 --> 06:25.969
- Hey, Paddy, call the fight.
- He's defending himself.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.679
He's a punching bag.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.306
[grunting]

06:31.183 --> 06:33.227
Victor, I'm ending it.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.062
Don't throw.
[grunting]

06:35.979 --> 06:37.397
[grunting continues]

06:37.397 --> 06:39.441
That's it.
We're done. We're done.

06:39.441 --> 06:40.776
- That's it. That's it.
We're done. We're done.
- No!

06:40.776 --> 06:42.402
We're done.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.529
VICTOR:
Why'd you call it, huh?

06:43.529 --> 06:45.572
Should've called it
two rounds ago.

06:45.572 --> 06:46.823
Next time you come in my ring,
I'm not

06:46.823 --> 06:48.033
letting your brother
near another fight.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.159
- What?
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.160
No, no, no.
She's just fucking around.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.286
- Oh.
- Apologize.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.913
- No. Fuck you, man tits.
- That's it.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.414
I'm recommending the commission
suspend her for three months.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.083
- Oh, I'm recommending
more vegetables!
- Come on, Paddy.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.376
- You can't fucking do that.
- Fuck you.

06:57.376 --> 06:58.418
Maybe try a fucking salad!

06:58.418 --> 06:59.545
What, you want
to fucking walk home?

07:01.588 --> 07:04.842
You never
throw in the towel, Josie.

07:04.842 --> 07:07.010
He was a can,
and he made you his bitch.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.012
Okay, I can't hear that.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.181
So now you're deaf
and blind.

07:12.307 --> 07:15.143
It's what I do, okay?

07:15.143 --> 07:17.145
You're not very good
at it anymore.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.398
Yeah?
Well, then stay home next time.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.358
So, Paddy can let you
get ground and pound

07:21.358 --> 07:23.360
till you see black?
Like in Inwood?

07:23.360 --> 07:24.903
Inwood was a mistake.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.655
You still fighting
is a mistake.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.240
[distant shouting]

07:28.240 --> 07:30.826
I should have a say
in things, too.

07:30.826 --> 07:32.244
I'm not a little girl anymore.

07:32.244 --> 07:35.122
- You're always my little girl.
- Fine.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.332
Then what'd you promise
this little girl?

07:37.332 --> 07:40.419
That one day we'd live
in a big old lighthouse,

07:40.419 --> 07:42.129
so that even
if it caught on fire,

07:42.129 --> 07:43.755
the waves would put it out.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.050
You said
you'd protect me forever.

07:49.261 --> 07:51.138
Can't do that
if you get yourself killed.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.390
[dramatic music plays]

07:53.390 --> 07:57.477
Payday. Door was light, man.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.188
Oh. Thanks, Hanley.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.273
You're welcome, buddy.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.237
This...

08:10.532 --> 08:13.076
...is our only way
to the lighthouse.

08:22.503 --> 08:25.964
Team Tiro,
esteemed members of the board,

08:25.964 --> 08:27.674
Madam Chairwoman,

08:27.674 --> 08:30.802
and, of course,
potential hunters

08:30.802 --> 08:33.013
linked in from around the world,

08:33.013 --> 08:36.767
I give you
Victor "Victory" Suero.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.812
Born in the hardscrabble neighborhood

08:40.812 --> 08:43.232
of Grand Concourse, the Bronx,

08:43.232 --> 08:46.944
he was a Silver Glove champion
by the age of 12.

08:46.944 --> 08:49.238
He had Olympic Committee reps

08:49.238 --> 08:50.989
drooling over him
by middle school.

08:50.989 --> 08:54.493
He was not only destined
for gold medal glory

08:54.493 --> 08:58.247
but to be the future
Light Heavyweight Champ.

08:58.247 --> 09:01.416
And then tragedy struck.

09:04.294 --> 09:08.215
At age 13, a fire tore
through the tenement

09:08.215 --> 09:11.468
where Victor lived,
killing both his parents.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.554
But through the flames
and the smoke,

09:13.554 --> 09:18.016
he was able to heroically rescue
his infant sister Josephine,

09:18.016 --> 09:21.854
but not before a burning ember
robbed him

09:21.854 --> 09:24.231
of almost all sight
in his left eye.

09:24.231 --> 09:27.651
This young man continued
to fight,

09:27.651 --> 09:30.028
literally and figuratively,

09:30.028 --> 09:34.032
to survive
despite his affliction.

09:34.032 --> 09:37.911
He trained for years preparing
for low-level MMA bouts,

09:37.911 --> 09:40.247
which, un-unlike boxing,
allow him

09:40.247 --> 09:43.417
to fight despite
his-his impairment.

09:43.417 --> 09:48.046
At age 18, he legally adopted
his sister Josie--

09:48.046 --> 09:52.885
that's what he calls her-- and
became more father than brother.

09:52.885 --> 09:54.553
So, to keep her
from foster care,

09:54.553 --> 09:57.514
he had to work two,
three jobs at a time

09:57.514 --> 10:01.351
while still chasing his dreams
of glory,

10:01.351 --> 10:05.355
which truthfully-- at the age
of 33-- will never come.

10:05.355 --> 10:10.402
And this is exactly why he will
be the greatest challenge

10:10.402 --> 10:12.779
our hunters have ever seen.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.866
He does not give up.
He does not quit.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.451
He doesn't know how.

10:17.451 --> 10:20.412
Look at him--
arms raised in triumph,

10:20.412 --> 10:22.664
screaming at the sky in hopes

10:22.664 --> 10:24.958
that Mother and Father
can hear him in heaven.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.961
This man has more heart,
more grit,

10:27.961 --> 10:31.757
than anyone we've ever admitted
into our midst.

10:31.757 --> 10:34.718
He will provide a level
of competition

10:34.718 --> 10:36.136
we've never seen before.

10:36.136 --> 10:40.182
He stood toe-to-toe
with an inferno and won.

10:40.182 --> 10:44.102
He is Victor in name
and victor in character.

10:44.102 --> 10:48.148
It is, frankly,
a once-in-a-lifetime privilege

10:48.148 --> 10:50.817
to have the opportunity
to hunt this man.

10:57.699 --> 11:01.328
The opening bid
is $75 million.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.455
[soft trilling]

11:03.455 --> 11:07.334
Well, every hunter meets
the seminal price.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.170
Well, let's separate the wheat
from the chaff.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.422
$110 million.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.716
[beeping]

11:19.555 --> 11:22.683
Ten remain.
Only half can win the right

11:22.683 --> 11:26.937
to participate in the greatest
hunt we'll ever experience.

11:26.937 --> 11:29.481
Well, I know
what Victor Suero is made of.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.733
Now, let's see
about our hunters.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.527
$200 million.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.612
[beeping]

11:38.156 --> 11:40.117
Who will blink first?

11:40.117 --> 11:43.620

11:53.589 --> 11:55.215

Congratulations.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.760
Congratulations, Monroe, Tyler,

11:58.760 --> 12:01.555
Pierce, Taft and Ford.

12:03.390 --> 12:07.144
Business Affairs will provide
the wiring instructions

12:07.144 --> 12:08.854
for our Panamanian partners.

12:08.854 --> 12:11.523
Now, if you'll all excuse me,

12:11.523 --> 12:15.736
I have to ensure
that Mr. Suero wants to be part

12:15.736 --> 12:19.239
of our game as much
as you all do. Thank you.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.366
[applause]

12:25.537 --> 12:29.166
- [indistinct chatter]
- Two more, Mike!

12:29.166 --> 12:31.460
All right.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.545
Take it home.

12:33.545 --> 12:36.215
[rhythmic beeping]

12:36.215 --> 12:38.592
Suero, Morelli can't cover
his 6:00 shift tomorrow.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.177
You cover it.

12:40.177 --> 12:42.429
Oh, no, no, Mr. Dupree,
I-I can't do 6:00.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.972
I train mornings.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.058
His wife's in labor.
He's already gone.

12:46.058 --> 12:49.144
Oh, I-I get it, I get it,
but, look, I got a...

12:49.144 --> 12:52.356
I got a fight coming up. Undercard.

12:52.356 --> 12:54.024
$10K prize money.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.484
- Really? $10K?
- Yeah. That purse is

12:55.484 --> 12:57.110
gonna get Josie
into cosmetology school.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.529
Vic, I love you, man, but

12:58.529 --> 12:59.780
you couldn't beat an egg
with that eye.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.198
My eye is fine.

13:01.198 --> 13:03.158
It's actually getting better, hmm?

13:03.158 --> 13:04.826
- Check my move.
- You're better?

13:04.826 --> 13:07.037
- Yeah.
- How many fingers
am I holding up?

13:08.705 --> 13:10.624
One.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.709
You're giving me the finger.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.840
[chuckles]
Be here at 6:00.

<i>Viele and Coster Street.</i>

13:39.736 --> 13:42.281
<i>There is auto shop.

- [dial tone]
- Hello?

13:44.950 --> 13:47.035
Hey!

13:48.954 --> 13:50.956
[mechanical whirring]

14:22.654 --> 14:23.989
What the hell's going on?

14:23.989 --> 14:25.616
I'm sorry. I fucked up.

14:25.616 --> 14:27.618
What do you mean
you fucked up? What you doing?

14:27.618 --> 14:30.162
Who are these people?
TIMUR: Mr. Suero.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.582
Oh.

14:33.582 --> 14:35.375
Is diet.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.793
It's better than regular.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.212
You called me.

14:38.212 --> 14:41.757
To discuss your sister's...
situation.

14:41.757 --> 14:43.217
I don't know who you are

14:43.217 --> 14:44.760
or what she's doing here,
but you...

14:44.760 --> 14:46.887
Josephine's valuable employee.

14:46.887 --> 14:51.225
I like her very much,
but she make very large mistake.

14:51.225 --> 14:53.143
You work here?

14:53.143 --> 14:54.728
About four months.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.146
What about the deli?

14:56.146 --> 14:57.564
Pay more here.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.275
- To do what?
- I explain.

15:00.275 --> 15:03.070
I hire Josephine because
she's young and beautiful--

15:03.070 --> 15:05.322
kind of person
police do not bother.

15:05.322 --> 15:09.201
So when she make pickups,
is no problem. Usually.

15:09.201 --> 15:10.619
What do you push?

15:11.662 --> 15:16.041
Money. I move currency
for people who cannot use banks.

15:16.041 --> 15:18.794
Now, to be fair to Josie,
when she took job,

15:18.794 --> 15:21.421
she thought there was
bookkeeping, some deliveries,

15:21.421 --> 15:24.216
but after a while, I told her
what she was carrying,

15:24.216 --> 15:28.011
for her own safety,
because I like Josephine.

15:28.011 --> 15:30.055
But today

15:30.055 --> 15:33.433
- she lost duffel bag on subway.
- I put it down to make a call.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.228
- These punks grabbed it and ran.
- How much?

15:36.228 --> 15:38.188
$500,000.

15:38.188 --> 15:41.275
[dramatic music plays]

15:44.361 --> 15:46.363
[sighs]

15:48.198 --> 15:49.700
Go home, Josie.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.245
Go home. Now!

15:53.245 --> 15:55.706
Yo, what you looking at him for?
I said go home!

15:55.706 --> 15:57.374
You are not the one

15:57.374 --> 16:00.043
to be calling the shots here,
big brother.

16:00.043 --> 16:05.257
Nobody leaves until I know
how I get my money back.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.556
[Victor sighs]

16:22.274 --> 16:25.527
I'll throw a match.
I'm a fighter.

16:25.527 --> 16:26.945
Your sister told me.

16:26.945 --> 16:29.281
I have a bout coming up,
and you bet against me.

16:30.407 --> 16:32.034
I fall.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.911
Josie,

16:33.911 --> 16:35.996
let men talk business, huh?

16:43.629 --> 16:46.173
[laughing]

16:47.966 --> 16:51.803
So, you are going to get me
my half million dollars

16:51.803 --> 16:53.847
with your little boxing match?

16:53.847 --> 16:55.641
What, do you think I'm idiot?

16:55.641 --> 16:57.601
You're a nobody.

16:57.601 --> 16:59.520
Who are you?

16:59.520 --> 17:02.105
I grew up around here,
and I know everybody.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.732
How come I don't know
who you are?

17:04.775 --> 17:06.735
Because while you're off

17:06.735 --> 17:09.071
doing your little
sports violence...

17:13.992 --> 17:15.077
...I make real violence.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.252
[thudding]

17:27.673 --> 17:29.675
You know who I am now?

17:30.676 --> 17:32.886
He was one of my best men,

17:32.886 --> 17:35.097
but he entrusted Josie
with package.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.682
Now, what do you think
I will do to person

17:36.682 --> 17:38.892
who actually lost the money?

17:38.892 --> 17:41.728
It would have
to be something so terrible,

17:41.728 --> 17:43.647
so horrific, that everybody

17:43.647 --> 17:46.108
in streets will hear about it,

17:46.108 --> 17:49.611
will fear about it
so no more mistakes occur.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.822
- I'm gonna get you the money,
okay?
- How?

17:51.822 --> 17:53.866
Tell me how
you will get me my money.

17:53.866 --> 17:57.744
Oh. Undercard fight
in VFW smoker, huh?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.538
[chuckles] Oh, come on.

17:59.538 --> 18:02.165
I put $5,000 on you.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.959
Bookies will know
something's wrong.

18:03.959 --> 18:06.795
No. No, no.
You'll get me my money.

18:06.795 --> 18:11.508
I don't care how,
but you get me my money,

18:11.508 --> 18:17.306
or Josie, your beautiful
little Josie, suffers.

18:17.306 --> 18:20.017
Do not try to run.

18:20.017 --> 18:22.144
You will never get out
of the Bronx.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.062
You kill me,
you never get your money.

18:24.062 --> 18:26.064
So you're gonna have
to give me some time.

18:26.064 --> 18:28.275
I don't have to give you shit!
Your sister

18:28.275 --> 18:32.821
lost money that belongs
to people <i>I</i> answer to!

18:34.781 --> 18:37.659
You will get me my money
by end of week.

18:37.659 --> 18:40.078
I ain't gonna have it
by then.

18:42.456 --> 18:44.958
[laughing]

18:47.544 --> 18:50.839
Okay. Okay.

18:50.839 --> 18:53.008
Okay.

18:53.008 --> 18:55.093
Here.

18:56.553 --> 18:58.388
You call them.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.766
They've helped others
who have owed me.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.776
Loan sharks?

19:10.776 --> 19:12.528
At least
they will give you some time.

19:12.528 --> 19:14.780
Something I cannot do.

19:19.368 --> 19:22.579
[horns honking]

19:22.579 --> 19:24.331
JOSIE: So, as soon as the
fight's over, that's it?

19:24.331 --> 19:26.041
We're done?
Timur's off our ass?

19:26.041 --> 19:27.751
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He's plugged in with guys

19:27.751 --> 19:29.419
that'll take in the action
in A.C.,

19:29.419 --> 19:31.046
in Philly. You know,

19:31.046 --> 19:34.258
he'll more than enough make up
what you lost him.

19:34.258 --> 19:36.093
We'll be fine.

19:36.093 --> 19:37.970
He'll leave us alone.

19:37.970 --> 19:39.847
No one'll know I'm dumping.
I'll make it look good.

19:39.847 --> 19:41.598
You should.
You've had enough practice.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.934
Oh, yeah? You being wise?

19:43.934 --> 19:48.146
Gross. Another knockout?

19:48.146 --> 19:50.357
That's eight
out of the last nine.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.985
Your age, your eye-- commission
will punch your ticket.

19:52.985 --> 19:55.445
I'm just glad
you won't be fighting anymore.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.531
- Yeah. I guess so.
- Good.

19:57.531 --> 19:59.157
Well, I'm gonna go
to the bodega.

19:59.157 --> 20:02.327
Gonna make some
lechon asado, some mofongo,

20:02.327 --> 20:06.373
maybe a little dessert,
and we'll celebrate.

20:06.373 --> 20:09.418
