00:18.360 --> 00:19.480
It's Clare.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.520
It's your Clare.

00:21.520 --> 00:24.080
And Neil Ackroyd.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.680
Is that her partner?
Neil Ackroyd?

00:28.440 --> 00:32.000
Looks like they started
visiting him just over a year ago.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.960
There's been four visits,

00:33.960 --> 00:37.360
and another one arranged for
this Saturday.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.640
This coming Saturday, 2pm.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.040
You all right?

00:41.040 --> 00:42.520
Catherine?

00:46.320 --> 00:47.680
Speak to me.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.520
Catherine.

00:50.520 --> 00:51.800
Why?

00:54.120 --> 00:55.760
Why would they do that?

00:58.720 --> 01:00.000
Why would Clare...?

01:02.320 --> 01:03.640
What will you do?

01:12.240 --> 01:13.280
Saturdays.

01:15.560 --> 01:18.200
All Saturdays when they've been
taking him to his football,

01:18.200 --> 01:19.520
and I've been working.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.080
You think you know people.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.000
How...how?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.120
How...?

01:30.720 --> 01:35.840
How's he got in touch with
our Ryan in the first place?

01:35.840 --> 01:38.360
Does Royce know your address?
Yeah.

01:38.360 --> 01:41.080
When he got that Frances Wealand
Drummond,

01:41.080 --> 01:44.280
whatever her name was,
to bring that Scalextric.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.720
But I'd have... No, I'd have
seen something, a letter,

01:46.720 --> 01:49.200
if it'd come to our house.
Ryan never gets any post

01:49.200 --> 01:51.040
and when he does,
he never bothers to open it.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.920
Well, does Royce know their
address? Clare and Neil's?

01:57.360 --> 01:58.400
How?

02:01.920 --> 02:04.240
And how could Ryan
have got in touch with him?

02:06.080 --> 02:08.120
How could he have known
he'd moved prisons?

02:08.120 --> 02:10.080
I didn't know
he'd moved prisons.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.720
I don't know.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.560
Four times.
All within this last year.

02:16.560 --> 02:18.280
Nothing before that.

02:18.280 --> 02:21.640
I've never liked that Neil.
He's spineless.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.720
And Clare, for God's sake.

02:23.720 --> 02:26.360
You see, she's the same.
Is she? Weak.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.800
What am I going to do?

02:35.800 --> 02:39.240
Well, you're not overreacting,
which is good.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.360
Shit.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.000
Can I do anything?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.400
No.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.200
Do you want to go home?
No.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.040
I might ask for this Saturday
off, though.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.440
What are you doing?

03:28.440 --> 03:30.240
What am I doing?
What are you doing?

03:30.240 --> 03:32.720
That's your...
Is that your lock?

03:32.720 --> 03:34.200
No, this is my lock.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.880
Some dickhead's
chained us bikes together. What?

03:38.880 --> 03:40.840
Ah, boys, there you are.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.000
You not racing off today?

03:42.000 --> 03:45.120
Somebody's chained
us bikes together...sir.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.640
Oh, what a shame.

03:47.840 --> 03:50.000
So, while you're here,
you're both in detention.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.040
What for? Did you do this? You know
perfectly well what for. A week.

03:54.040 --> 03:55.840
Lunchtime detention.
What have I done?

03:55.840 --> 03:57.480
I'm not arguing about it.

03:57.480 --> 03:59.880
It was him. I never said owt.
I was just with him.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.240
And yet... Oh, yeah!

04:01.240 --> 04:02.360
You ran off.

04:02.360 --> 04:05.040
Because you were chasing us
in your car.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.040
Look, I have warned you before

04:07.040 --> 04:09.960
about what thin ice you are
skating on, motormouth.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.440
So if I were you, I'd shut it.

04:12.440 --> 04:14.000
Take your punishment like a man.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.560
I know it's a bit of a leap,

04:15.560 --> 04:18.800
but use this in future to think
about what comes out of this.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.960
Piss off, you twat!
What did you say?

04:20.960 --> 04:22.840
Talking to us
like six-year-olds.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.600
Maybe it's because you behave like
you're six year old!

04:24.600 --> 04:27.160
Yeah, up your arse. Right, that's
it! You're off the football team!

04:27.160 --> 04:28.560
You can't do that, sir!

04:28.560 --> 04:31.640
Good. I don't care. I've resigned
off it anyway cos it's shit!

04:31.640 --> 04:33.720
I'm not having that!
You come back here now!

04:33.720 --> 04:35.560
It was me, sir. Yesterday.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.200
I said it. Punish me!

04:37.200 --> 04:39.480
It's not even worth being on! It's
the shittest team I've ever seen!

04:39.480 --> 04:41.400
You just can't stop yourself,
can you?

04:41.400 --> 04:43.880
They play like a load of little
girls! It's an embarrassment!

04:43.880 --> 04:45.520
You can't kick him
off the football team, sir.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.040
It's the only thing
he's any good at!

04:47.040 --> 04:48.880
Do you not want your bike
back, then, Cawood?

04:48.880 --> 04:50.960
Swivel!

04:58.880 --> 05:01.240
What have I done to him?!

05:01.240 --> 05:03.960
Right. It sounds like his
bookshelf's just gone over,

05:03.960 --> 05:07.000
so...that'll be that little
telly you gave him smashed.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.280
I'd come round and help, but
there's only me and Lexie on

05:10.280 --> 05:11.520
till Marie turns up.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.960
No, you're all right.
I just wanted to share the joy.

05:13.960 --> 05:16.640
I don't know exactly
what's gone on,

05:16.640 --> 05:18.840
but I think that games
teacher's a funny beggar.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.120
May well be.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.280
But if it is escalating
and our Ryan's

05:22.280 --> 05:23.920
saying stuff he shouldn't,

05:23.920 --> 05:25.400
then he is going to get into bother.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.520
He's trying to get t'door
off its hinges now.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.080
You want to put him on?
I'll try and have

05:32.080 --> 05:35.480
a quick word with him. No, he's...
He won't come to t'phone.

05:35.480 --> 05:38.680
He hasn't threatened
to hurt you, has he? No!

05:40.080 --> 05:41.720
He's called me
a drug-addled piss artist,

05:41.720 --> 05:43.720
but I'm trying not
to take it personally.

05:43.720 --> 05:45.040
I'm trying to remind myself

05:45.040 --> 05:46.800
that it's the anger speaking
and not

05:46.800 --> 05:48.880
him just being
a repulsive little shit.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.120
Love, I'm going to have to go.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.960
As soon as Marie gets here,
I'll phone you,

05:53.960 --> 05:56.000
and if you want me to pop round,

05:56.000 --> 05:57.800
I will. OK.

05:57.800 --> 06:00.520
What have I done?!

06:00.520 --> 06:01.560
Bye.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.320
Mm-hm. Can we bring anything?

07:13.320 --> 07:15.040
Can we bring the dessert?

07:15.040 --> 07:16.640
Oh, hang on.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.880
Are we all right to go
to Zainab and Farhan's

07:18.880 --> 07:21.440
on Friday evening? They got
the decking finished.

07:21.440 --> 07:22.840
15 grand.

07:22.840 --> 07:26.760
Yeah, we'll be there.
Hi, Dad. Hiya. You all right?

07:26.760 --> 07:29.200
Just figuring out how I'm going to
pay for the new decking

07:29.200 --> 07:32.160
your mother will be requiring
shortly. How come?

07:32.160 --> 07:34.000
Probably just as soon as
she comes off the phone.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.840
Even though there's nothing
wrong with the deck...

07:35.840 --> 07:38.480
Her sister's got some.
Auntie Zainab? Cool!

07:38.480 --> 07:40.640
There is water in the tap,
you know.

07:40.640 --> 07:44.640
What? Nothing. Yeah, but it doesn't
taste t'same.

07:44.640 --> 07:47.520
It does! It's water.
It tastes exactly the...

07:47.520 --> 07:48.880
..same...

07:50.160 --> 07:51.720
Great! Mm-hm.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.960
Clare and Neil? No way.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.240
What are you going to do?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.920
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.120
Could it be...

08:13.120 --> 08:16.160
Well, not them?

08:16.160 --> 08:19.360
Somebody using their names
for some reason?

08:19.360 --> 08:22.400
I don't know. Yeah, well,
I wondered that, but no.

08:22.400 --> 08:25.560
Every visit's coincided with
when I've been working Saturdays,

08:25.560 --> 08:27.680
so, no, it'd be too much
of a coincidence. It's them.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.440
You know, and this is
the bloke that's up in court

08:29.440 --> 08:31.360
next week for another murder,
and Clare knows that.

08:31.360 --> 08:32.560
We've even talked about it.

08:32.560 --> 08:34.000
Ask her.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.400
No. No, I'm not going to ask
any of them anything.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.680
I'm going to watch them.
I'm going to observe.

08:38.680 --> 08:41.040
And come Saturday,
I'm going to follow 'em,

08:41.040 --> 08:43.600
and...I don't know.
I don't know.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.120
I don't know.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.920
You can't avoid 'em.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.440
Well, I can't avoid 'em,
you're right.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.920
She's in there. She rang me,
and that's another saga.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.640
He's had a spat with
his bloody games teacher

08:52.640 --> 08:54.800
and got himself chucked off
his football team.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.600
Is that that Gary Gackowski murder

08:58.600 --> 09:00.720
Royce is in court for next week?

09:00.720 --> 09:03.240
Yeah. Why?
What do you know about it?

09:03.240 --> 09:06.560
Oh, it's just...something
I'm working on.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.080
You're around tomorrow?

09:09.080 --> 09:11.640
Well, I'm working, but I can be.

09:11.640 --> 09:13.040
Why?

09:13.040 --> 09:14.640
Want to meet up?

09:14.640 --> 09:16.600
For a cup of tea or something.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.760
Catch up...

09:17.760 --> 09:18.880
..properly.

09:18.880 --> 09:19.960
Yeah, can do.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.320
Come on. Bed.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.160
Hiya.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.800
Why aren't you in bed?

09:42.800 --> 09:44.880
It's five to 11.
He's got school tomorrow.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.320
I've been kicked off
t'football team

09:46.320 --> 09:47.600
for something
I didn't even do.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.560
So I understand, and then you
trashed your bedroom. He did, yeah.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.400
But we've tidied most of it up now,
so... Oh, have you? Oh, good.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.440
Well, that'll teach him.
That's a good message.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.240
Trash your bedroom
and your Auntie Clare'll

09:57.240 --> 09:59.040
tidy it up for you. I helped him

09:59.040 --> 10:01.200
because he calmed down
and then he apologised.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.120
So, what's happened, then?

10:03.120 --> 10:05.120
Hepworth. He's a twat.
Oh, swearing!

10:05.120 --> 10:07.720
So if I ring Mr Baines
in the morning

10:07.720 --> 10:09.320
and if I ask for an
appointment with him,

10:09.320 --> 10:11.360
we explain what's happened,
that you've had a spat

10:11.360 --> 10:13.680
with Mr Hepworth, that's going to be
your defence, is it?

10:14.800 --> 10:15.840
He's a twat?

10:15.840 --> 10:18.720
He's chased us in his car,
on us bikes.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.640
And then he's chucked me
off t'team. For nothing? Yeah.

10:21.640 --> 10:24.800
Cesco shouted, "Have you
had your oats, sir?"

10:24.800 --> 10:27.120
which is what started it, but...

10:27.120 --> 10:29.560
Yeah. And nothing else was said?

10:29.560 --> 10:31.400
Yeah... Well, yeah,

10:31.400 --> 10:34.880
quite a lot else was said,
but I didn't start it.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.800
I DEFINITELY didn't start it.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.040
I can't think about this now.
Go to bed. Yeah, but... Bed.

10:45.360 --> 10:48.560
Come on, you get your stuff. I'll
drive you home. It's OK. I can walk.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.720
All right.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.440
Right, OK. Well,

10:54.440 --> 10:56.440
I'll love you and leave you.

10:56.440 --> 10:58.880
There's half a moussaka in there,

10:58.880 --> 11:01.640
just wants warming up.

11:01.640 --> 11:03.040
Thanks.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.360
Can't walk home on her own!
It's dark. It's fine.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.520
It's only round the corner.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.000
And up the hill.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.960
Drunks will be out.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.200
You had a bad day?

11:15.360 --> 11:16.520
No, it's been very quiet.

11:16.520 --> 11:19.240
I've been able to catch up
on my paperwork.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.960
Text me when you get in.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.280
Right.

11:26.440 --> 11:28.560
Night-night.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.720
Ta-ta, love. Bye. Night-night.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.080
Well, who's rattled your cage,
Grandmother?

11:35.360 --> 11:36.400
Bed.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.680
Just getting some water.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.200
You're smoking?

12:28.520 --> 12:30.600
It's bad for you, smoking.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.160
So I believe.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.560
Why are you in a funny mood?

12:44.360 --> 12:46.120
I'm not.

12:46.120 --> 12:49.440
What will I do
if you do go off in that...

12:49.440 --> 12:52.040
..thing to the Himalayas?

12:55.200 --> 12:56.480
I don't know.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.560
What would you like to do?

13:01.080 --> 13:03.160
Come with you.

13:05.840 --> 13:08.840
You don't want to be hanging out
with me. You're 16.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.480
I told him to shove his team
up his arse. But...

13:17.480 --> 13:20.160
..that were only after
he started talking to me

13:20.160 --> 13:21.800
like I was about six.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.680
Yeah, well, like I say,
let's sort it out tomorrow

13:24.680 --> 13:26.720
if you want
to get back on the team.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.600
Do you want to get back
on the team?

13:30.960 --> 13:32.280
Yeah.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.640
Be better if he weren't
such a dickhead, though.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.520
Well, dickheads
are a fact of life.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.880
Anywhere you look,
there'll be a dickhead.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.920
Better get used to it.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.240
Night-night.

13:47.480 --> 13:48.960
Night-night.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.680
Love you.

13:53.480 --> 13:56.200
The trick is to negotiate
your way around 'em...

13:57.720 --> 14:00.680
..without 'em even realising
you think they are a dickhead.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.280
Yeah.

14:02.280 --> 14:05.600
And then revenge is a dish
best served cold.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.000
I've got it all ready
for you.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.560
Just popping out for a sec.

14:57.440 --> 14:58.520
Faisal!

14:58.520 --> 14:59.920
Hiya.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.360
Have you got five minutes?

15:05.240 --> 15:07.960
I thought he was going to
kill me. I think, one day,

15:07.960 --> 15:10.440
he will kill me,
and no-one will even notice.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.200
I've got to get out of there,
Faisal. Yeah. Well, yeah.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.520
And the girls. I couldn't leave
without the girls. Course not.

15:17.520 --> 15:19.600
It's happened before, this.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.720
There's usually some lad
at school.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.600
He...gets a fixation,
an obsession,

15:24.600 --> 15:27.280
and he'll pick a fight
with them, basically,

15:27.280 --> 15:28.520
to get their attention.

15:28.520 --> 15:31.040
Pick a fight, knock their
confidence, then be the person

15:31.040 --> 15:33.320
that picks them up
and turns their life around.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.480
And then...God knows what.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.200
They're usually kids
that haven't got

15:37.200 --> 15:38.960
any proper parenting
going on at home.

15:38.960 --> 15:43.320
But during this phase,
he gets all edgy

15:43.320 --> 15:46.560
and then he gets handy
with his fists

15:46.560 --> 15:48.000
and takes it out on me.

15:49.480 --> 15:52.520
Thing is, when we first...

15:52.520 --> 15:55.000
When you started helping me,

15:55.000 --> 15:58.560
you did say you might be able
to help me get a little flat,

15:58.560 --> 16:00.040
or something. So me and the girls,

16:00.040 --> 16:03.160
we could get out of there.
Did I? Yeah!

16:03.160 --> 16:05.680
Well, I might have suggested it

16:05.680 --> 16:08.480
as an idea for you to
think about, but I don't....

16:08.480 --> 16:10.640
It isn't something
I could pay for.

16:10.640 --> 16:11.720
Is that... Is that what you...?

16:11.720 --> 16:13.920
What I thought? Yeah,
that is what I thought.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.440
I thought that you were
wanting to help me.

16:15.440 --> 16:17.280
No, Joanna, I couldn't afford
to do that!

16:17.280 --> 16:19.760
It must have just been
a suggestion. An idea.

16:19.760 --> 16:23.080
Sorry if you thought... What, if I
thought that you cared about me?

16:23.080 --> 16:26.440
I do! I did. I do. But I can't
afford to be buying a flat.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.040
You said that you were
thinking about speculating

16:29.040 --> 16:31.720
in property... Yeah, but not...
Not at the moment.

16:31.720 --> 16:33.480
Definitely not at the moment.

16:33.480 --> 16:34.640
Right.

16:34.640 --> 16:36.480
These aren't my shops,
you know?

16:36.480 --> 16:37.880
I know you think they are.

16:37.880 --> 16:40.200
I just manage this one
and the one down at Elland.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.880
It's Anisha's dad that owns them

16:41.880 --> 16:43.640
and me and her sister,
we just manage them.

16:43.640 --> 16:47.720
And apart from that, money's
just a bit tight at the moment.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.360
Police will be charging me
with something

16:51.360 --> 16:53.480
when that diazepam
comes back from the lab,

16:53.480 --> 16:55.600
and then they'll be leaning
on me again

16:55.600 --> 16:57.280
to say where I got it from.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.880
You know,
I'm not making threats,

16:59.880 --> 17:03.240
but they might not be
happy with me just saying

17:03.240 --> 17:06.080
I just found it behind
some toilets this time.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.520
Hey, Shaf!
My interview was successful.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.480
They want me to start my six-month
attachment at CID next week.

17:14.480 --> 17:16.680
Yeah. Yeah. I saw you tiddling
about on your phone when

17:16.680 --> 17:19.040
you're meant to be interfacing
with a member of the public.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.680
So, guess what?

17:20.680 --> 17:22.160
You won't be able
to boss me about

17:22.160 --> 17:23.480
when you take over
from Catherine.

17:23.480 --> 17:26.280
I will. I'll still be a rank
above you.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.560
You won't, cos I'll be upstairs.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.440
Yeah, but I will,
cos I'll come and find you

17:29.440 --> 17:32.280
just to give you orders. CID!

17:32.280 --> 17:35.720
- Say, "Well done, Ann."
- Well done!

17:35.720 --> 17:39.120
Sitting in an office all day,
bending paperclips.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.440
You're just jealous.

17:40.440 --> 17:41.840
Yeah.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.560
Not.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.360
Oh, my God, Shaf. What?

17:45.360 --> 17:47.600
Your ears! They've gone
green. Is it envy?

17:47.600 --> 17:50.920
Not everybody wants to be
in CID, you know. Some of us

17:50.920 --> 17:52.800
like being in uniform. Yeah.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.560
And the rest.
Hello, love.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.240
I'm Acting Sergeant Shah.
This is PC Gallagher.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.760
You may have heard, sadly,
somebody died yesterday

17:59.760 --> 18:01.840
that lived in one
of these flats behind here.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.720
And we're just having a chat
with everyone, just in case

18:03.720 --> 18:06.320
you might have seen anything
or heard anything.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.920
Is that all right if we pop in?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.920
Yeah, come in. Thank you.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.160
Ta-ta.

18:23.720 --> 18:25.800
I missed a call from you.
How are you doing?

18:25.800 --> 18:28.800
Well, I'm on a house-to-house
down Elland, so...

18:28.800 --> 18:31.160
Have there been
any developments?

18:31.160 --> 18:32.400
No.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.280
Have you said anything?

18:35.280 --> 18:36.800
Nope.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.760
Have you still got time
for a cup of tea today?

18:43.360 --> 18:45.560
Yeah, I've got a meal break
at one.

18:45.560 --> 18:47.320
I wanted to ask you about
this other thing.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.400
What other thing?

18:50.400 --> 18:53.320
I've been approached by this
journalist from the Guardian.

18:53.320 --> 18:55.840
He's developing a piece
about organised crime links

18:55.840 --> 18:57.560
to local government.
He saw a piece

18:57.560 --> 19:00.280
I wrote in the Yorkshire Post
last year,

19:00.280 --> 19:01.840
and he's asked me to do

19:01.840 --> 19:04.600
some digging for him
on Darius Knezevic.

19:06.320 --> 19:07.720
Oh, OK.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.000
And I thought

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
half an hour with you might be a
good place to start.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.120
Yeah, well, I can tell you
everything you need to know

19:14.120 --> 19:15.520
about that sleazy twat.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.720
Course, these days,
he behaves like butter

19:17.720 --> 19:19.120
wouldn't melt up his arse.

19:19.120 --> 19:20.760
And of course,
I can't tell you everything,

19:20.760 --> 19:23.520
because if I did know
everything, he'd be in prison,

19:23.520 --> 19:26.200
and for a not inconsiderable
period of time.

19:26.200 --> 19:30.120
Do you know he's standing for
election onto Bradford City Council?

19:30.120 --> 19:32.320
Oh. Well, West Yorkshire.
But...

19:32.320 --> 19:34.600
..that can't happen, surely.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.560
What, are you serious?

19:36.560 --> 19:38.480
You do know they elected
one of the biggest liars

19:38.480 --> 19:40.440
and tax dodgers in history
to be the so-called leader

19:40.440 --> 19:42.360
of the free world across
the pond not so long since?

19:42.360 --> 19:46.040
Richard, I'm going to have to go.
Where do you want to meet up?

19:46.040 --> 19:47.840
You decide. Text me.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.080
Catherine...?

19:55.160 --> 19:56.400
Alison?

19:57.400 --> 19:58.480
Catherine.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.120
Cawood.

20:00.120 --> 20:03.440
I thought I'd seen your name on the
box as a newly released.

20:03.440 --> 20:05.320
How are you?

20:05.320 --> 20:07.360
I'm all right.

20:08.360 --> 20:11.600
I'll give you a hand. Where are you
going with it? No, you're fine.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.680
Don't be daft. Which one is it?

20:15.040 --> 20:17.960
Thanks. It's just down here.

20:17.960 --> 20:21.640
What are you lot doing here?
Is it about that woman?

20:21.640 --> 20:24.120
Yeah, it's just a bit of
house-to-house.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.480
You got five minutes?

20:25.480 --> 20:26.840
Yeah.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.840
I've got a settee to go with
this in the back of the van.

20:28.840 --> 20:31.800
If you do want to be useful, then
there'll be summat to sit on.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.840
Very enterprising.

20:36.840 --> 20:39.360
Week out of prison
and you've got wheels?

20:39.360 --> 20:41.360
I lost everything else.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.960
The farm was only ever
on lease, so no chance.

20:43.960 --> 20:47.440
One of the neighbours
let me leave this in his yard

20:47.440 --> 20:49.000
and he's kept it ticking over.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.240
Well, his dickhead son has.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.240
And he's knackered the clutch.

21:03.480 --> 21:08.120
Spent the last three years
at Aldborough. Open prison. Ah.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.440
I learned how to do highlights.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.280
And to drive a forklift truck.

21:13.280 --> 21:15.840
Got me licence
to drive a forklift truck.

21:15.840 --> 21:18.480
Don't ask me to do your hair.
You'll regret it.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.080
Who's your probation officer?

21:22.080 --> 21:24.400
Carol Sewell. Do you know her?

21:24.400 --> 21:25.720
She drinks.

21:25.720 --> 21:27.080
She turns up half-cut

21:27.080 --> 21:30.400
or doped up to her eyeballs
on anti-anxiety meds.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.240
She comes here,
tells me her problems,

21:32.240 --> 21:33.720
and then she toddles off
somewhere else

21:33.720 --> 21:34.960
before I can tell her any of mine.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.880
Where are you working?

21:36.880 --> 21:40.400
Ramsden's Ready Meals on the
industrial estate down here.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.240
They supply all
t'big supermarkets.

21:42.240 --> 21:45.720
It's money. If you hear of anything
else going, give us a shout.

21:45.720 --> 21:47.400
I'll keep me ear to the ground.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.560
Make a few phone calls, and...

21:49.560 --> 21:51.280
Will you?

21:51.280 --> 21:52.800
Yeah, sure.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.400
So what's happening with
this lass in the flat upstairs?

21:57.400 --> 22:02.160
She came out of a window. What, like
suicide? Drugs? Was she pushed?

22:03.920 --> 22:05.600
Who knows?

22:05.600 --> 22:07.160
You see, that pisses me off.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.280
Look at this.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.920
These windows
aren't meant to open so far.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.880
Everything's bust.

22:20.520 --> 22:24.360
And behold, no sprinkler system.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.440
And even if there was a sprinkler
system,

22:26.440 --> 22:29.600
chances are it wouldn't work.
Shall I tell you why?

22:29.600 --> 22:32.320
Government contracts
are very lucrative,

22:32.320 --> 22:34.480
so everyone wants them,
including -

22:34.480 --> 22:36.280
surprise, surprise - criminals.

22:36.280 --> 22:37.320
So...

22:37.320 --> 22:40.640
So, you're saying these window
fittings where this girl died

22:40.640 --> 22:42.200
were all from a dodgy source?

22:42.200 --> 22:43.560
Well, I've no idea
where they're from.

22:43.560 --> 22:45.200
What I'm saying is,
it's not impossible.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.880
So...

22:46.880 --> 22:50.200
..these companies spring up
and put on the hard sell,

22:50.200 --> 22:52.000
and then when there's a
problem with the product,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.200
which inevitably there is,
because it's shit,

22:54.200 --> 22:55.720
where's the company gone?

22:55.720 --> 22:57.840
Disappeared, winked up,
fucked off.

22:57.840 --> 23:01.040
That'll be the Knezevics.
Moved on to the next scam.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.840
So how do... If it is
the Knezevics, say,

23:03.840 --> 23:07.160
how do they get the contract
in the first place?

23:07.160 --> 23:09.480
Is there no due diligence?
Course,

23:09.480 --> 23:12.080
but it's not impossible that
whoever's making the decisions

23:12.080 --> 23:14.680
is bent or compromised,
or the criminal shows them

23:14.680 --> 23:17.040
a quality product that works
and does the job,

23:17.040 --> 23:18.120
but then when they supply them,

23:18.120 --> 23:19.960
it looks for all the world
the same, but it isn't.

23:19.960 --> 23:23.640
It's rubbish. But people only find
that out when it fails.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.920
And this is on top of
all the drug-running

23:25.920 --> 23:27.800
and people-trafficking and...
Yeah.

23:27.800 --> 23:30.320
Yeah, yeah.
It just goes hand in hand.

23:30.320 --> 23:33.720
CID took down this fella
in Huddersfield last year -

23:33.720 --> 23:36.920
he was connected to something like
58 different businesses.

23:36.920 --> 23:38.680
No! Yeah. How many CID hours

23:38.680 --> 23:41.160
do you think that took to wade
through?

23:41.160 --> 23:43.400
And of course, it's all about
laundering money in the end

23:43.400 --> 23:45.600
and there's still any number
of ways to do that despite

23:45.600 --> 23:48.160
the banks tightening things.
So, yeah.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.480
Yeah, they still have their
car washes and their nail bars

23:50.480 --> 23:52.640
and their newsagents
and their restaurants

23:52.640 --> 23:54.320
and their lap-dancing bars, yeah.

23:54.320 --> 23:56.040
Under the viaduct
in Sowerby Bridge.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.440
Remember that?

23:57.440 --> 23:59.120
They call themselves
businessmen.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.680
They've got their finger in any
number of dirty little pies,

24:01.680 --> 24:03.160
and it's naive to think that

24:03.160 --> 24:05.400
they won't infiltrate
local government.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.880
That's exactly what he's doing
in Bradford now.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.400
It's all part of
how they operate.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.000
It's how they keep themselves
informed.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.720
It's how they hide
in plain sight.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.320
Do you know...

24:18.320 --> 24:20.080
..anything about a rumour

24:20.080 --> 24:22.160
Darius Knezevic
is connected to this murder

24:22.160 --> 24:24.800
that Tommy Lee Royce
is in court for next week?

24:30.760 --> 24:32.120
I've heard things.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.320
They'll never nail it onto
Darius Knezevic.

24:38.320 --> 24:39.680
He's too clever.

24:43.640 --> 24:46.000
You do know this could be
dangerous, don't you?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.320
Yeah. For you.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.960
If you get too close.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.240
Right, I better be off.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.720
It's just a chance to work on
something proper.

24:59.720 --> 25:01.840
Something that can make
a difference.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.600
Yeah, go for it.
It needs doing.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.120
Just be careful
who you talk to

25:05.120 --> 25:07.520
and how much you tell them
about yourself.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.880
So what's the story about
this girl that died, then,

25:09.880 --> 25:11.640
in this flat in Elland?

25:17.000 --> 25:19.160
She came out of
a fourth-floor window.

25:20.560 --> 25:24.200
Division went in and found
boxes and boxes and boxes

25:24.200 --> 25:27.560
of cash, tens of thousands
of pounds. Drugs?

25:27.560 --> 25:30.120
She'll have been cuckooed.
That'll be the Knezevics.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.960
They can't launder money
fast enough,

25:31.960 --> 25:34.080
so what do you do with it?
Where do you put it?

25:34.080 --> 25:35.840
You hide it in somebody
else's place,

25:35.840 --> 25:37.320
somebody who ain't got a clue

25:37.320 --> 25:40.320
what's going on and couldn't
do a fat lot about it if they did.

25:41.520 --> 25:42.880
Fucking hell, now what?

25:44.920 --> 25:46.440
Oh, shit. School.

25:47.960 --> 25:49.280
Hello.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.800
Is that Catherine? It is.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.080
It's David Baines
over at Elm Wood.

25:54.080 --> 25:56.200
Mr Baines, how's yourself?
I don't suppose

25:56.200 --> 25:58.520
you might have time
to pop into the school?

25:58.520 --> 26:00.920
What, now?
Yes, if that's possible.

26:00.920 --> 26:03.400
Well, I can, as it happens,
I'll be passing that way.

26:03.400 --> 26:06.040
But I'm on duty,
so I'll have to be brief.

26:06.040 --> 26:07.360
What's occurred?

26:35.240 --> 26:38.480
I'll be in court next Tuesday.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.920
Because you shopped me

26:41.920 --> 26:45.560
to the police
all those months ago.

26:46.560 --> 26:47.760
But I want you to know...

26:51.520 --> 26:53.080
..I forgive you.

26:55.960 --> 26:57.680
May the Lord be with you.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.000
Chips or mash?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.480
Er...

27:18.000 --> 27:19.480
You going to hurry up, or
what?

27:22.440 --> 27:23.720
Fucking doing?

27:32.760 --> 27:35.680
Enough! Enough.

28:26.480 --> 28:28.720
I'm not sure
that's necessarily the case.

28:28.720 --> 28:31.160
I know his grandmother
often works shifts.

28:31.160 --> 28:33.760
It'll be too much time
left to his own devices, then.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.600
And there's no father, is
there? Not as far as I know.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.360
Now what?

28:46.360 --> 28:47.760
Oh, my God.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.960
Did you have to come
dressed like that?

28:49.960 --> 28:52.280
Shall I let him know
you're here, Mrs Cawood?

28:52.280 --> 28:54.760
Yes, you can, love, thanks.
Is that a gun?

28:54.760 --> 28:57.360
Thought police weren't supposed to
have guns in this country.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.880
It's a Taser, you twit. They let you
loose with one of them?

28:59.880 --> 29:03.400
Yeah. Why wouldn't they?
Aren't you a bit old? In.

29:04.600 --> 29:05.680
Ta, love.

29:08.040 --> 29:11.280
Ah, Catherine.
Thanks for popping in.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.440
Mr Baines.

29:12.440 --> 29:15.640
Mr Hepworth.
How's your wife?

29:16.800 --> 29:18.640
Yeah, she's... She's...

29:18.640 --> 29:21.040
She's very, very, very...

29:22.600 --> 29:24.120
She's all right, thank you.

29:25.400 --> 29:26.880
Good.

29:26.880 --> 29:28.520
So, what's the charge?

29:28.520 --> 29:30.640
Would you like to sit down?

29:30.640 --> 29:31.840
Ryan?

29:35.920 --> 29:38.920
So, as I explained
on the phone,

29:38.920 --> 29:41.880
Mr Hepworth believes it was
Ryan who damaged his car.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.520
Did you?

29:43.520 --> 29:45.160
No. Do you know who did?

29:45.160 --> 29:47.480
No. Has anyone talked to you
about someone touching

29:47.480 --> 29:50.560
Mr Hepworth's car? No.

29:50.560 --> 29:52.440
Show me your hands.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.440
What's in your pockets?
Nothing.

29:57.440 --> 30:00.080
Have you asked him to empty his
pockets? I can't do that.

30:00.080 --> 30:01.920
Stand up. Empty your pockets.

30:17.280 --> 30:18.400
Really?

30:20.160 --> 30:22.720
Do you know
when the damage occurred?

30:22.720 --> 30:26.160
Well, between when I parked
the car there this morning

30:26.160 --> 30:27.960
and when it was brought
to my attention

30:27.960 --> 30:29.960
by another member
of staff at dinner time.

30:29.960 --> 30:32.240
And who has access to that
area during the day?

30:33.400 --> 30:35.240
Well, everyone.

30:35.240 --> 30:36.480
But...

30:36.480 --> 30:38.120
Any CCTV?

30:38.120 --> 30:41.160
Er, not covering
that area, no.

30:41.160 --> 30:43.160
So, what's led you to believe
it was Ryan?

30:43.160 --> 30:48.000
Only that he and I had
an altercation yesterday.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.400
And I'm not accusing him.
I thought you were.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.760
I'm sorry. I thought
that's why I was here.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.520
Well, I thought...

30:54.520 --> 30:57.120
I'm sorry, Mr Hepworth.
I thought you were.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.080
Well, someone's done it.

31:02.520 --> 31:04.880
Right. Well, if you want me to
write a police report, I can...

31:04.880 --> 31:07.680
No, I don't think we need to
go down that route,

31:07.680 --> 31:10.080
do we, Mr Hepworth?
Well, actually, I can't,

31:10.080 --> 31:11.680
because if you are accusing Ryan,

31:11.680 --> 31:13.360
another officer needs
to deal with it.

31:13.360 --> 31:16.040
No, I just asked you in as his
grandmother, really, not as...

31:16.040 --> 31:17.760
Although to be absolutely
honest with you,

31:17.760 --> 31:18.840
you'll need more evidence

31:18.840 --> 31:20.440
than the fact that you've had
an altercation with him.

31:20.440 --> 31:22.640
And even then, we're not
really talking about

31:22.640 --> 31:24.960
criminal damage, are we?
If the tyres had been slashed

31:24.960 --> 31:26.240
and it was indelible marker pen,

31:26.240 --> 31:29.040
then yeah, we would be.
But they weren't, so it isn't.

31:29.040 --> 31:31.600
And can I ask you, Mr Hepworth,
are you quite certain

31:31.600 --> 31:33.640
in your own mind that you
haven't made an assumption

31:33.640 --> 31:36.520
it was Ryan precisely because you
did have this altercation

31:36.520 --> 31:38.880
with him yesterday?
This was the altercation

31:38.880 --> 31:40.960
about Ryan using
unacceptable language.

31:40.960 --> 31:43.360
See, this is why it in't
adding up to me, because...

31:44.480 --> 31:45.960
..last night, Ryan, well...

31:48.200 --> 31:50.080
He was emotional, certainly.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.760
But when he got over
being emotional,

31:51.760 --> 31:53.560
he was talking about
apologising to Mr Hepworth

31:53.560 --> 31:55.760
for saying something
he shouldn't have done

31:55.760 --> 31:57.920
in the hope of getting back
on the team. Now, to my mind

31:57.920 --> 32:00.000
that in't consistent with him
daubing up his car.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.880
Back on the team?

32:01.880 --> 32:04.640
The football team. That's what the
altercation was about.

32:04.640 --> 32:07.480
No, it was about me being
blamed for something

32:07.480 --> 32:10.720
which Cesco said,
which Cesco admitted,

32:10.720 --> 32:12.760
and then he tried to chase us

32:12.760 --> 32:15.480
on us bikes in his car.
No, I didn't.

32:15.480 --> 32:16.720
Can't you arrest him for that?

32:18.960 --> 32:23.800
Did you drive on the kerb?
No. Pleased to hear it.

32:23.800 --> 32:26.160
Why don't we do
a bit more finding out?

32:26.160 --> 32:28.600
See if we can find anyone
who saw something.

32:28.600 --> 32:32.480
And then hopefully we can find a
solution that allows Ryan

32:32.480 --> 32:36.600
to get his place back on the
team, if that's what he wants

32:36.600 --> 32:38.920
and Mr Hepworth agrees.

32:38.920 --> 32:40.400
Is that what you want, Ryan?

32:40.400 --> 32:41.640
Yes, sir.

32:43.080 --> 32:46.840
Well, I'm sorry, Catherine.
I hope I haven't wasted your time.

32:48.360 --> 32:50.800
No. Like I say, I was passing.

32:56.640 --> 32:59.480
You get your bike back?
Yeah.

32:59.480 --> 33:03.680
Well, that was weird. Hepworth is
weird. I kept telling you.

33:03.680 --> 33:06.240
You know Mr Baines rang me like
you'd been caught red-handed,

33:06.240 --> 33:08.160
and then not a scrap
of evidence.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.240
I bet Hepworth did that
himself to his car

33:10.240 --> 33:11.440
to get me into trouble.

33:11.440 --> 33:14.000
Should have made him
turn his pockets out.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.640
By the way, I didn't do it,

33:16.640 --> 33:19.280
No, I know you didn't.
How?

33:19.280 --> 33:21.440
Because I've seen how you draw a
cock and balls when we play

33:21.440 --> 33:23.480
Picture Consequences,
and it's nothing like that.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.320
Did you have a good day?
Yeah.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.520
- What's all this mess?
- What mess?

38:13.560 --> 38:17.000
Right. I'm just off up to
the driving range, girls.

38:28.200 --> 38:29.480
Mummy?

38:31.720 --> 38:33.520
Mm?

38:33.520 --> 38:37.120
Why doesn't Daddy like you?

39:05.720 --> 39:07.800
I called in the shop.
Your little assistant

39:07.800 --> 39:09.120
said you'd be here.

39:09.120 --> 39:11.840
Did you find time to look up
flats on the internet?

39:12.960 --> 39:15.520
Yeah. Jo, I...
Seriously, I can't afford

39:15.520 --> 39:17.240
anything like that at the moment.

39:17.240 --> 39:19.120
I mean, you know,
if he's knocking you about,

39:19.120 --> 39:22.040
you ought to go to the council
and ask for a flat. Yeah.

39:22.040 --> 39:23.760
Yeah, I think you should do that.

39:23.760 --> 39:25.280
They won't give me anything.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.080
I'll go on a list.
People wait years.

39:27.080 --> 39:29.440
Do you really think that's where I
want Florence and Poppy

39:29.440 --> 39:31.760
to grow up? Is that where you'd want
your kids to grow up?

39:31.760 --> 39:33.960
Do your parents know
what he's like?

39:33.960 --> 39:36.240
They don't bother with me.
Why?

39:38.000 --> 39:39.640
I think I might kill him.

39:40.800 --> 39:44.040
Well, yeah, certainly that would
solve some problems.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.280
Might create a few new ones.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.360
I should be allowed
to get divorced.

39:47.360 --> 39:50.040
Except he'd win.
He'd win everything.

39:50.040 --> 39:52.560
He'd get the girls, he'd get
the house, all of his pension.

39:52.560 --> 39:55.560
Why would he win?
Because that's what he's like.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.880
He always has to win.

39:56.880 --> 40:00.280
But if he just wasn't there,

40:00.280 --> 40:03.360
we could just live there.

40:03.360 --> 40:06.800
Me and the girls. And my God,
my life would be so easy.

40:06.800 --> 40:08.280
What would you live on?

40:08.280 --> 40:09.920
Fresh air.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.440
How would you pay the mortgage?

40:11.440 --> 40:13.880
I don't know. I don't care.

40:13.880 --> 40:15.840
I might get away with it.

40:17.800 --> 40:20.520
People know what he's like.
That policewoman did.

40:20.520 --> 40:22.800
She was nearly begging me to shop
him for coercive control.

40:22.800 --> 40:26.720
Why didn't you? Because you said
you were going to help me.

40:29.240 --> 40:32.440
And you know, as soon as
all that officialdom kicks in,

40:32.440 --> 40:35.680
they can take your children off you
like batting an eyelid. So...

40:40.160 --> 40:41.280
I don't know.

40:41.280 --> 40:43.320
I don't know.
Maybe I should go talk to her.

40:43.320 --> 40:44.760
I'm going to have to talk to

40:44.760 --> 40:47.080
one of them anyway when
those drug results come back.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.040
I'm being blackmailed.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.040
That's why it's a struggle

40:52.040 --> 40:54.320
to help you out
just at the moment.

40:54.320 --> 40:56.480
These lads came into the shop.

40:56.480 --> 40:59.520
One of them got me in my little
consulting room and he had a gun.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.800
They want 1,800 quid a week, or...

41:01.800 --> 41:02.920
Are you joking?

41:02.920 --> 41:07.160
They're organised. They threatened
to hurt my family. Shit. Yeah.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.840
Well, can't you go to the police?

41:08.840 --> 41:10.360
How?

41:10.360 --> 41:12.800
When I've been helping
people like you?

41:12.800 --> 41:15.360
As soon as they start sniffing
around, they're going to

41:15.360 --> 41:18.440
lift the lid on stuff I shouldn't
have been doing. So they've got me.

41:18.440 --> 41:21.600
I'm sorry. I wish I could
help you, but I can't.

41:22.760 --> 41:26.440
Rob knows it was you
who gave me that diazepam.

41:28.720 --> 41:29.960
How?

41:29.960 --> 41:31.480
I told him.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.560
Shit. Joanna!

41:34.560 --> 41:35.960
I didn't want to.

41:35.960 --> 41:38.600
But you know, when someone's wanting
to know stuff

41:38.600 --> 41:41.520
and they're punching the crap
out of you until you tell them...

41:41.520 --> 41:43.200
Why didn't you
make something up?

41:43.200 --> 41:46.000
I did to start with, but...

41:51.560 --> 41:54.400
I have thought about
how I'd do it.

41:55.680 --> 41:58.080
If I did kill him.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.000
He drinks.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.960
Despite all his healthy body,
healthy minds stuff,

42:03.960 --> 42:07.960
Friday night, he drinks
himself into a massive stupor.

42:07.960 --> 42:10.320
And I've often thought

42:10.320 --> 42:14.320
if I could just get hold of
some ketamine

42:14.320 --> 42:16.520
and drop it into his drink,

42:16.520 --> 42:19.760
then I could put a cushion
over his face.

42:19.760 --> 42:22.000
Or an injection.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.040
If you inject air into
someone's bloodstream.

42:24.040 --> 42:26.560
Is that true?
That it'll kill them?

42:26.560 --> 42:29.360
Yeah. I think if you got air
in your bloodstream,

42:29.360 --> 42:31.600
you wouldn't be finding
a lot to laugh at.

42:34.520 --> 42:36.520
Perhaps you can help me
with that, then.

42:36.520 --> 42:39.040
If you can't help me with
a little flat.

42:39.040 --> 42:41.520
I don't handle ketamine, Joanna.

42:41.520 --> 42:42.720
It's not a prescription drug.

42:42.720 --> 42:45.080
Well, something else, then.

42:45.080 --> 42:46.920
You're a chemist.

43:42.560 --> 43:43.880
This is very kind of you.

43:43.880 --> 43:46.320
I'm decluttering. Anything you don't
want,

43:46.320 --> 43:48.880
just drop back in the box
and I'll put it on Freecycle.

43:48.880 --> 43:51.360
No, I think I can use all this.

43:51.360 --> 43:52.720
Thanks.

43:52.720 --> 43:54.600
Got you an interview for a job.

43:54.600 --> 43:55.800
When?

43:55.800 --> 43:57.120
It's driving a forklift truck.

43:57.120 --> 43:58.520
No way!

43:58.520 --> 44:00.600
Yeah, you've to ring that
number, give them your name

44:00.600 --> 44:05.080
and then they'll book you in.
Nevison Gallagher? Yeah.

44:05.080 --> 44:07.080
Industrial refrigeration.
It's on the same

44:07.080 --> 44:11.080
industrial estate as
Ramsden's, down here. Oh, I know.

44:12.960 --> 44:14.960
If there's ever anything
I can do for you,

44:14.960 --> 44:16.560
you will let me know, won't you?

44:18.320 --> 44:20.800
Yeah, well, actually - and this
isn't why I've done it

44:20.800 --> 44:22.800
so do say no if it's not
convenient, but...

44:24.200 --> 44:26.440
..if I leave you
my little Ford...

44:27.880 --> 44:30.560
..could I borrow your truck for a
couple of hours on Saturday?

44:30.560 --> 44:32.760
As long as you're not doing owt
dodgy in it.

44:32.760 --> 44:34.040
I'm only out on licence.

44:56.200 --> 44:58.760
Dad! Avinash is having
driving lessons.

44:58.760 --> 45:01.480
Can I get driving lessons?
How much are they?

45:01.480 --> 45:03.960
An arm and a leg.
For my birthday?

45:03.960 --> 45:07.960
Dad! Hmm? Oh. We'll have to see.
What do you mean?

45:07.960 --> 45:09.640
I mean, we'll have to see.

45:13.720 --> 45:16.720
Have you been
following my son

45:16.720 --> 45:18.120
as well as my daughters?

45:18.120 --> 45:20.800
I only ask because I'd love to
know what the little sod

45:20.800 --> 45:23.080
gets up to when he's
supposed to be at school.

45:31.240 --> 45:32.680
What's his name?

45:34.200 --> 45:35.520
Tahir.

45:46.360 --> 45:49.200
You haven't got a son, Faisal.

45:52.360 --> 45:54.040
You try and fuck with me again

45:54.040 --> 45:55.280
and I will prove to you

45:55.280 --> 45:57.920
that I know your daughters
better than you do.

45:59.680 --> 46:01.280
Especially that eldest one, eh?

46:03.320 --> 46:07.040
Next week, yeah? Oh, and it'll be
Thursday, not Wednesday.

46:07.040 --> 46:08.640
I'm getting married on Wednesday.

46:10.720 --> 46:12.240
You not going to congratulate me?

46:14.080 --> 46:15.440
Congratulations.

46:15.440 --> 46:17.040
Nice.

46:17.040 --> 46:19.480
And next week, cos you tried
to fuck with me, I want this

46:19.480 --> 46:22.160
plus another 1,500. No, I can't do
that. Oh, you can.

46:22.160 --> 46:25.120
You'd be silly not to. I told you,
the police might be onto me.

46:25.120 --> 46:26.800
How?

46:26.800 --> 46:28.520
Hmm? Eh?

46:28.520 --> 46:29.600
How?

46:29.600 --> 46:33.760
This...woman I gave
a few pills to got arrested,

46:33.760 --> 46:36.000
and the pills were confiscated
by the police.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.160
And she's not told them
where she got them from,

46:38.160 --> 46:39.320
but I worry that she will.

46:39.320 --> 46:41.880
She has to go back when the
tests on the drugs come back.

46:41.880 --> 46:43.960
And I worry...that she's flaky

46:43.960 --> 46:45.800
and that she could say anything,

46:45.800 --> 46:48.960
and she reckons she's told her
husband, and he could, too.

46:50.640 --> 46:52.240
Well, sort them out.

46:52.240 --> 46:53.440
Both of them.

46:54.560 --> 46:56.480
How?

46:56.480 --> 46:58.240
That's not my problem.

46:58.240 --> 47:01.600
And if it becomes my problem, well,
like I say...

47:02.720 --> 47:04.760
..wouldn't take much to
persuade me to go say hello

47:04.760 --> 47:06.120
to that eldest one of yours.

47:09.320 --> 47:10.920
See you Thursday.

47:41.440 --> 47:43.480
Where are you going?
Football.

47:44.720 --> 47:46.320
You back on t'team? Yeah.

47:46.320 --> 47:48.480
He asked me yesterday.
Last minute. Only cos

47:48.480 --> 47:50.280
he couldn't find anyone else
daft enough to do it.

47:50.280 --> 47:52.600
Was he all right wi' you?
Yeah.

47:52.600 --> 47:54.040
Can I eat this pizza cold?

47:55.280 --> 47:56.680
Yeah, why not?

47:56.680 --> 47:58.400
Who are you playing?

47:58.400 --> 48:00.280
I mean, I won't die from...

48:01.320 --> 48:04.480
..cheese poisoning? I doubt it.
Who are you playing?

48:04.480 --> 48:06.760
Hipperholme.
There or here?

48:06.760 --> 48:09.000
Here. Clare and Neil
are taking me,

48:09.000 --> 48:12.360
cos I thought you were
working this Saturday.

48:13.880 --> 48:16.400
Well, I was supposed to be,
but I'm not now, so...

48:18.080 --> 48:19.800
Do you want me to come?

48:19.800 --> 48:22.920
You don't have to. I texted
Clare about it last night

48:22.920 --> 48:24.480
and she was fine with it.

48:24.480 --> 48:26.840
So, we might drive into Leeds
and look at some shops, so...

48:26.840 --> 48:30.280
..you can play with your Land Rover.
Love you! See ya. Bye.

48:55.920 --> 48:57.480
Hiya.

48:57.480 --> 48:59.080
How are you doing?

49:01.320 --> 49:03.560
He's playing football. They
should be finishing any time,

49:03.560 --> 49:06.040
then they're reckoning they're going
to Leeds shopping, so...

49:07.400 --> 49:09.480
..I don't know.

49:09.480 --> 49:11.600
I forgot to tell you, because
the clutch is knackered,

49:11.600 --> 49:14.360
you need to double declutch
when you go up the gears.

49:14.360 --> 49:16.040
OK.

49:16.040 --> 49:17.960
Otherwise it pops into
neutral.

49:17.960 --> 49:19.160
OK.

49:19.160 --> 49:21.360
And then you get honked at
by a twat behind.

49:21.360 --> 49:22.840
OK.

49:23.920 --> 49:26.240
Do you know how to
double declutch?

49:26.240 --> 49:29.000
Oh, yeah. I was born in 1966.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.560
I remember when cars
didn't always go. Memories!

49:32.560 --> 49:38.280
They're on the move. I'm going to
have to go, Alison. Good luck. Ta.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.760
Oh, I stink. Has anyone
got any wet wipes?

50:33.760 --> 50:35.600
There might be some in there.

50:35.600 --> 50:37.320
What, in here? Mm-hm.

50:37.320 --> 50:38.800
No, can't see any.

50:38.800 --> 50:40.880
Oh, you're all right.
I forgot I had this.

50:42.600 --> 50:45.560
Jesus, Ryan! Oh, bloody 'ell, lad.
You must smell like

50:45.560 --> 50:48.760
a poke of monkeys, needing to douse
yourself in chemicals like that.

50:48.760 --> 50:50.360
Oh...

51:50.760 --> 51:52.640
See you later, love.
See you in a bit.

54:18.720 --> 54:20.080
Shit.

54:27.920 --> 54:29.320
Hiya.

54:29.320 --> 54:31.160
Where are you?

54:32.560 --> 54:33.720
Leeds.

54:33.720 --> 54:34.760
Leeds?

54:34.760 --> 54:36.640
I'm in a coffee shop. Are you?

54:36.640 --> 54:39.040
They wanted to look round Game,

54:39.040 --> 54:41.680
and they can spend hours
in there, them two,

54:41.680 --> 54:44.640
and it bores me rigid, so I
come and get a cup of coffee

54:44.640 --> 54:46.440
and let them fill their boots.

54:46.440 --> 54:48.640
How was the football?

54:48.640 --> 54:51.440
Well, they lost,
but they did very well.

54:51.440 --> 54:52.840
Yeah?

54:52.840 --> 54:54.600
3-0.

54:54.600 --> 54:57.360
So, that's really not that bad
for them.

54:57.360 --> 54:59.960
He did a couple of good dives
and he saved one or two,

54:59.960 --> 55:03.240
you know, when he stopped talking
long enough to concentrate.

55:05.400 --> 55:07.400
Anyway, what can I do you for?

55:09.320 --> 55:11.720
Nothing, really. I was just...

55:13.520 --> 55:15.520
..ringing to find out
how you'd gone on.

55:16.800 --> 55:18.520
Oh, you mean with that Hepworth?

55:18.520 --> 55:20.080
Er...

55:20.080 --> 55:21.640
..he were fine.

55:21.640 --> 55:24.920
There were no incidents,
no nasty comments.

55:24.920 --> 55:27.880
Not that I know of. I didn't see
much of him, to be honest.

55:27.880 --> 55:29.080
What did you say to him?

55:30.440 --> 55:31.480
Nothing much.

55:32.800 --> 55:34.400
I think Ryan's
little old granny

55:34.400 --> 55:36.760
turning up dressed like
RoboCop didn't compute,

55:36.760 --> 55:38.320
so his undercarriage fell off.

55:42.680 --> 55:44.080
You at a loose end?

55:45.960 --> 55:47.200
No.

55:50.800 --> 55:52.440
I hate Leeds.

55:53.680 --> 55:55.520
Do you?

55:55.520 --> 55:58.400
Don't know why we come.
I'd rather be at home.

56:01.200 --> 56:02.240
Mm.

56:07.360 --> 56:08.560
Is there owt else?

56:08.560 --> 56:12.640
Only I've got a moderately
interesting looking sandwich

56:12.640 --> 56:14.240
staring at me and it won't

56:14.240 --> 56:17.080
get out of its bit of packaging all
by itself.

56:19.880 --> 56:21.520
No.

56:21.520 --> 56:23.280
No, I was just...

56:24.960 --> 56:27.040
Yeah, wondering
how you'd gone on.

56:30.840 --> 56:32.640
So, I'll see you when I see you.

56:32.640 --> 56:34.720
Yep.

56:35.960 --> 56:38.200
When you get back from Leeds.

56:40.400 --> 56:42.160
OK. Ta-ta.

56:43.200 --> 56:44.240
Bye-bye.

57:18.800 --> 57:20.400
Hiya.

57:22.320 --> 57:24.920
# In this trouble town

57:24.920 --> 57:27.840
# Troubles are found

57:30.880 --> 57:33.480
# In this trouble town

57:33.480 --> 57:36.440
# Words do get 'round

57:41.880 --> 57:44.520
# Stuck in speed bump city

57:44.520 --> 57:46.640
# Where the only thing that's pretty

57:46.640 --> 57:49.360
# Is the thought of getting out. #
