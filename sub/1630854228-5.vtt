WEBVTT

00:03.042 --> 00:04.944
[child giggling]

00:05.044 --> 00:06.785
- Sorry we're late.

00:06.885 --> 00:09.026
- Was there a lot of traffic
coming from upstairs?

00:09.126 --> 00:11.948
- [chuckles] I blame that fancy
mattress in the guest bedroom.

00:12.048 --> 00:13.429
I swear, we never
used to sleep in.

00:13.529 --> 00:14.989
- I know!

00:15.089 --> 00:16.510
To think I went my entire life
without knowing

00:16.610 --> 00:18.471
that I was
an eight medium firm

00:18.571 --> 00:19.912
with a ten-degree leg
elevation.

00:20.012 --> 00:22.274
- [scoffs]
Go 40 degrees or go home.

00:22.374 --> 00:23.835
- Well, I barely slept.

00:23.935 --> 00:25.476
I'm too excited
about my appearance

00:25.576 --> 00:27.557
on "Live with Kelly and Ryan."

00:27.657 --> 00:30.639
- Really? You're going to be
on "Live with Kelly and Ryan"?

00:30.739 --> 00:32.520
I had no idea!
- Seriously?

00:32.620 --> 00:34.041
I've been talking about it
so much--

00:34.141 --> 00:35.401
Oh, you're being mean.
Okay, got it.

00:35.501 --> 00:37.122
- Aw, it's like
my dream come true.

00:37.222 --> 00:39.004
- I know, all that hard work,
finally paying off.

00:39.104 --> 00:40.564
- Right, your thing,

00:40.664 --> 00:41.965
but, also, I'm going
to be in the same room

00:42.065 --> 00:45.007
as Kelly Ripa
and Ryan Seacrest.

00:45.107 --> 00:47.008
When I was a stay-at-home mum,
they were the only adults

00:47.108 --> 00:48.409
that would keep me
company, so...

00:48.509 --> 00:49.770
- Yeah, a couple times
I walked in

00:49.870 --> 00:51.251
on her talking back to the TV.

00:51.351 --> 00:52.812
[whispering]
Actually a little creepy.

00:52.912 --> 00:53.892
[cell phone buzzes]

00:53.992 --> 00:55.493
- Oh, that's our landlord,

00:55.593 --> 00:57.975
probably calling
to give more excuses

00:58.075 --> 00:59.776
as to why
our apartment's not ready.

00:59.876 --> 01:01.657
- I don't know why these
repairs are taking so long.

01:01.757 --> 01:04.539
It's not like the apartment
was nice before.

01:04.639 --> 01:08.741
- Hey, don't tell them,
but the suite I booked

01:08.841 --> 01:11.623
at our hotel in New York
is bigger than their apartment.

01:11.723 --> 01:14.825
- "Our hotel"?
So you're coming with us?

01:14.925 --> 01:16.546
- Yeah, Tom,
I'm your publisher.

01:16.646 --> 01:18.387
Got to be there to make sure
the interview goes well.

01:18.487 --> 01:20.028
- Right, right, right.

01:20.128 --> 01:22.269
Connor, look,
I'm so appreciative

01:22.369 --> 01:24.030
of everything
you've done for me.

01:24.130 --> 01:26.351
You've been very, very present.

01:26.451 --> 01:28.152
- Stop.

01:28.252 --> 01:29.873
- But I think I can handle
this one all by myself.

01:29.973 --> 01:32.075
- Oh.
Yeah, great.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.276
I'm really proud of you, man.
- Thank you.

01:34.376 --> 01:36.317
Wow.
That means a lot.

01:36.417 --> 01:38.719
- [chuckles]

01:38.819 --> 01:40.159
- You're still coming,
aren't you?

01:40.259 --> 01:42.081
- Oh, absolutely.
- I thought so.

01:42.181 --> 01:45.743
- So what's the bad news now--
another week of repairs, two?

01:47.144 --> 01:48.564
Oh, the apartment's
ready today?

01:48.664 --> 01:50.806
Like, today today?

01:50.906 --> 01:53.607
Wow.
No, that's--yeah.

01:53.707 --> 01:55.709
Uh-huh,
thank you for the update.

01:57.830 --> 02:00.652
The apartment is ready.
- Oh, good.

02:00.752 --> 02:02.012
- Finally.
- Yeah.

02:02.112 --> 02:03.893
- Right?
- Back to our regular lives.

02:03.993 --> 02:07.215
To our bed
with zero leg elevation.

02:07.315 --> 02:08.976
- No Bluetooth toilet.

02:09.076 --> 02:11.058
- Complete lack of sauna.
- Mm-hmm.

02:11.158 --> 02:13.139
- So what's the update?
- So...

02:13.239 --> 02:15.700
- It's not ready yet!
- Oh, wow.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.502
- Yeah, I mean, you know how
these things just take forever.

02:18.602 --> 02:20.103
- Mm-hmm, yeah,
I hope you don't mind us

02:20.203 --> 02:21.464
sticking around
for a little longer.

02:21.564 --> 02:22.945
- Yeah, it's fine by me,

02:23.045 --> 02:24.385
but since I'm going to be
in New York

02:24.485 --> 02:25.906
and Gretchen's
at her mum's place,

02:26.006 --> 02:27.107
I told Lupe she could take
the week off.

02:27.207 --> 02:28.668
- I'm going to visit a lover.

02:28.768 --> 02:30.989
- Would you guys be okay
to be here all alone?

02:31.089 --> 02:32.790
- Don't worry about us.
- Yeah.

02:32.890 --> 02:34.872
- We'll manage.
- Cool.

02:34.972 --> 02:37.313
- Thank you.
- [chuckles]

02:37.413 --> 02:39.594
- Fire up that sauna.
Mama's ready to sweat.

02:39.694 --> 02:43.837
- Ooh!
- Mm, mm, mm, mm.

02:43.937 --> 02:46.779
- ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪

02:49.420 --> 02:51.161
- Okay, uh, the kids
are at my folks'.

02:51.261 --> 02:53.162
I packed my neck pillow,
my back pillow,

02:53.262 --> 02:56.084
my feet pillows,
AKA my slippers.

02:56.184 --> 02:58.165
Oh, hey,
you're here early, man.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.367
Flight doesn't take off
for, like, five hours.

03:00.467 --> 03:02.408
- [sighs] Tom, why don't
you have a seat?

03:02.508 --> 03:05.410
- Have a seat, Tom.
- Okay.

03:05.510 --> 03:07.411
If this is about seeing
"Aladdin" on Broadway,

03:07.511 --> 03:09.252
I can do that by myself.

03:09.352 --> 03:11.573
- We think it'd be a good idea
to do some media training

03:11.673 --> 03:13.414
before New York.

03:13.514 --> 03:15.175
- What are you talking about?
I don't need media training.

03:15.275 --> 03:17.056
I've been doing interviews
for weeks.

03:17.156 --> 03:18.377
- Yeah, that's
why we're worried.

03:18.477 --> 03:20.378
- Yeah.

03:20.478 --> 03:22.580
- And when you're taking the
raw material of your own life

03:22.680 --> 03:24.781
and transubstantiating
that into fiction,

03:24.881 --> 03:26.042
you're faced with
the existential question of,

03:26.122 --> 03:27.863
what is truth?

03:27.963 --> 03:29.424
Reminds me of something
that Jonathan Franzen wrote

03:29.524 --> 03:31.225
when he was asked what role
literature plays

03:31.325 --> 03:33.826
in a post-democratic world.

03:33.926 --> 03:35.827
[chuckles]
I don't know if we're watching

03:35.927 --> 03:37.669
the same interview here,
guys, but I am killing it.

03:37.769 --> 03:39.229
- Honey, let's be honest.

03:39.329 --> 03:41.071
You're long-winded,
and you come across as--

03:41.171 --> 03:43.432
don't take this the wrong way--
a total douche.

03:43.532 --> 03:45.433
- So what's the right way
to take that?

03:45.533 --> 03:47.314
- And what's up with the hand?

03:47.414 --> 03:49.596
You know, you look like you're
working a grill at Benihana.

03:49.696 --> 03:51.557
- People love this.
Look at the comments.

03:51.657 --> 03:53.798
All right, this person
called me a real cutie.

03:53.898 --> 03:54.919
- Check the username
on that one.

03:55.019 --> 03:56.199
- "TommysMommyMuriel."

03:56.299 --> 03:57.680
Okay, that could be anybody.

03:57.780 --> 03:58.921
- Look, if you want
this book to sell,

03:59.021 --> 04:00.362
you're going to have to appeal

04:00.462 --> 04:01.683
to more than just our mum,
all right?

04:01.783 --> 04:03.124
You're going to be
on national TV.

04:03.224 --> 04:04.404
- Let's do
a practice interview.

04:04.504 --> 04:06.125
I can help.

04:06.225 --> 04:07.686
I've seen every single episode
of "Kelly and Ryan."

04:07.786 --> 04:09.647
I know what
a good interview looks like.

04:09.747 --> 04:11.689
You want to be 2016
Jerry O'Connell,

04:11.789 --> 04:14.190
not 2019 Jerry O'Connell.

04:15.951 --> 04:18.012
- Okay, sure, I guess.
- Great.

04:18.112 --> 04:20.314
Let's get some duct tape
for those hands.

04:22.435 --> 04:24.296
- You know, every time
I go to the bathroom,

04:24.396 --> 04:26.337
I discover something new.
- Same!

04:26.437 --> 04:29.339
Did you know the rain shower
has a monsoon setting?

04:29.439 --> 04:32.621
- So does the bidet.
- [laughing] Oh, my God.

04:32.721 --> 04:33.702
Mm.

04:33.802 --> 04:35.342
So what should we do next?

04:35.442 --> 04:36.663
Maybe watch something
in the home theatre?

04:36.763 --> 04:40.666
- Ooh, HGTV in HDTV?
[laughter]

04:40.766 --> 04:42.347
- You know,
there's that new movie

04:42.447 --> 04:44.308
where Laura Dern throws
a glass of wine at the wall.

04:44.408 --> 04:47.269
- I love when she does that.
- I love when she does that.

04:47.369 --> 04:49.751
- Hey, uh, since we're off
from school tomorrow,

04:49.851 --> 04:51.752
could I invite a friend
to sleep over?

04:51.852 --> 04:54.194
- Ooh, I don't know, sweetie.
This is Uncle Connor's house.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.155
- Yeah.
So invite more than one!

04:57.255 --> 04:59.076
There's all this room!
- Yeah, go crazy!

04:59.176 --> 05:00.677
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

05:00.777 --> 05:04.720
[upbeat music playing]

05:04.820 --> 05:06.841
- And then I come home,
and I find Mark in the kitchen

05:06.941 --> 05:08.442
with nothing on but an apron.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.923
He cooked a four-course meal
from scratch.

05:11.023 --> 05:13.845
And he was the dessert!
[laughter]

05:13.945 --> 05:16.807
- I just went antiquing with
the Kardashians last weekend,

05:16.907 --> 05:19.849
and I got to tell you,
Khloe loves a credenza.

05:19.949 --> 05:22.050
- Oh, does she?
[laughs]

05:22.150 --> 05:23.931
- So are you gonna
introduce me or--

05:24.031 --> 05:26.533
- I'm getting there, Tom.

05:26.633 --> 05:29.935
So please welcome the author
of the new novel,

05:30.035 --> 05:32.576
"Home Economics," Tom Hayworth!

05:32.676 --> 05:35.138
[light applause]

05:35.238 --> 05:37.259
Hey!
- Thanks for coming by.

05:37.359 --> 05:38.820
- Okay.

05:38.920 --> 05:42.862
- So, Tom, I read
and loved your book.

05:42.962 --> 05:46.084
And I got to say,
talk about it.

05:46.804 --> 05:47.705
- Sure.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.506
Uh, thank you.

05:49.606 --> 05:51.867
It's a roman à clef,
as the French said--

05:51.967 --> 05:54.069
- [imitates buzzer] All right,
Tom, this answer already sucks.

05:54.169 --> 05:55.590
And I'm obviously speaking
as Connor here,

05:55.690 --> 05:57.311
because Ryan
would never be that rude.

05:57.411 --> 05:58.691
- Try kicking it off
with a self-deprecating joke.

05:58.771 --> 06:00.673
Kelly will love that.

06:00.773 --> 06:03.314
- Yeah, something like, "Are we
sure this isn't a big mistake?

06:03.414 --> 06:05.035
Did you mean to book
Stephen King?"

06:05.135 --> 06:07.156
- Or, "Oh, I really stressed
out your makeup team.

06:07.256 --> 06:09.278
They said they'd never seen
someone so pale."

06:09.378 --> 06:10.839
- Or like,
"They asked me backstage

06:10.939 --> 06:12.359
"what kind of hairstyle
I wanted, and I said,

06:12.459 --> 06:14.201
'Give me the full Tig Notaro.'"

06:14.301 --> 06:16.042
- [laughing] Yes.

06:16.142 --> 06:18.523
- Great.
Any others?

06:18.623 --> 06:20.164
- "The wardrobe team didn't
know what to do with me.

06:20.264 --> 06:21.685
They said it was like
dressing a scarecrow."

06:21.785 --> 06:23.446
- A praying mantis.
- A boy on stilts.

06:23.546 --> 06:25.547
- A stale cake pop.

06:25.987 --> 06:27.248
- Thanks.

06:27.348 --> 06:29.810
- So are
the characters really based

06:29.910 --> 06:32.091
on your actual family members?

06:32.191 --> 06:33.772
- Well, they were
a launching point,

06:33.872 --> 06:35.333
but eventually
my imagination--

06:35.433 --> 06:36.854
- [imitates buzzer]
Boring.

06:36.954 --> 06:38.615
- Can I just finish
one answer, please?

06:38.715 --> 06:42.777
- So, Tom, is this one
of those books that has themes?

06:42.877 --> 06:44.498
- Yes.

06:44.598 --> 06:46.860
Uh, as I see it, the story
is really about fairness--

06:46.960 --> 06:48.120
- [imitates buzzer]
Stop looking at your feet.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.102
- Tom, eye contact.
- Right.

06:50.202 --> 06:52.143
Why our self-worth
is so tied to money.

06:52.243 --> 06:53.304
- Okay, this is
too much eye contact.

06:53.404 --> 06:55.025
You're freaking me out, man.

06:55.125 --> 06:56.866
- [voice cracking] Ultimately,
I hope that the readers

06:56.966 --> 06:58.947
see their own families
reflected in these pages.

06:59.047 --> 07:00.348
- Now you sound
like Marty McFly.

07:00.448 --> 07:01.388
- Oh, my God,
I totally hear it.

07:01.488 --> 07:02.749
- What?
No, come on!

07:02.849 --> 07:03.990
I do not sound like
Michael J. Fox.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.551
You know what?
Screw this.

07:05.651 --> 07:07.392
This interview's over!
- Honey, come on!

07:07.492 --> 07:09.153
- No! If anything, you guys are
just making me more nervous.

07:09.253 --> 07:10.334
And, yes, I know I'm all
over the place with my hands.

07:10.414 --> 07:11.674
- We're just trying to help.

07:11.774 --> 07:13.075
- Yeah, Tom,
this is your big moment.

07:13.175 --> 07:14.796
You've worked so hard
to get here.

07:14.896 --> 07:16.557
- Okay, let's break it down
to three simple rules--

07:16.657 --> 07:18.638
relax, don't ramble,
and never look at the camera.

07:18.738 --> 07:20.079
- You do those three things,

07:20.179 --> 07:22.321
the books will fly
off the shelves.

07:22.421 --> 07:24.362
- Okay, yeah.
Let's just keep going.

07:24.462 --> 07:27.664
- And we'll be right back
with more Tom Hayworth.

07:29.585 --> 07:30.966
- [softly] So, as I said to
Chelsea last week,

07:31.066 --> 07:33.207
I looked at her and said--

07:33.307 --> 07:35.048
- Sorry, are we
still doing this?

07:35.148 --> 07:38.170
- We're on break, Tom.
Save it for the air.

07:38.270 --> 07:41.972
[quirky music]

07:42.072 --> 07:44.013
- I know I said sending
Shamiah to Windmount

07:44.113 --> 07:45.894
with all those rich kids
was a bad idea,

07:45.994 --> 07:47.776
but I feel like she's
fitting in really well.

07:47.876 --> 07:50.417
