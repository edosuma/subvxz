Previously on
"Love &amp; Hip-Hop: Hollywood"...

00:05.471 --> 00:07.140
{\an8}Have you been
in contact with Ray?

00:07.207 --> 00:08.775
{\an8}Yeah, I sent him
a text message.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.044
{\an8}You're a (bleep) up person.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.044
{\an8}I'm a (bleep) up person?

00:11.111 --> 00:13.046
{\an8}You're a (bleep) up person,
you're unloyal to everybody.

00:13.113 --> 00:14.514
{\an8}(fighting sounds)

00:14.581 --> 00:15.682
{\an9}Bitch!
Bitch!

00:15.749 --> 00:17.217
{\an7}I'll (bleep) you up!
Don't (bleep) with me!

00:17.283 --> 00:20.153
{\an7}This is why the bitch doesn't
know you (bleep) married!

00:20.220 --> 00:22.122
{\an7}Why don't you wear your ring
when you're going to the--

00:22.188 --> 00:23.223
{\an8}Let me tell you something.

00:23.289 --> 00:24.257
{\an7}Since you care about
this ring so much?

00:24.324 --> 00:26.493
{\an9}Mm-hmm.

00:24.324 --> 00:26.493
{\an8}You can have it.

00:26.559 --> 00:27.994
{\an7}You should be thanking me,
you're welcome.

00:28.061 --> 00:29.896
{\an8}I will never thank
a ho for anything.

00:29.963 --> 00:30.897
{\an8}Bitch, I'll (bleep)--

00:30.964 --> 00:32.866
{\an7}Bitch!
Say something.

00:32.932 --> 00:34.534
{\an8}Something's going on, Amber.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.369
{\an7}I'm gonna tell you
to open your eyes, baby.

00:36.436 --> 00:37.570
{\an8}I know you love him.

00:37.637 --> 00:39.038
{\an8}We've been talking
about counseling.

00:39.105 --> 00:40.206
{\an8}And honestly, Angel,

00:40.273 --> 00:41.474
{\an8}I do think that's
the first step.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.910
{\an8}I've had feelings
towards the same sex.

00:43.977 --> 00:46.279
{\an7}The main reason that you
wanted to come here today,

00:46.346 --> 00:49.349
{\an8}you want Amber to come
and you want to be able

00:49.416 --> 00:50.550
{\an8}to tell her all of this.

00:50.617 --> 00:51.718
{\an9}Yes.

00:51.785 --> 00:53.753
{\an7}And so can you imagine
what kind of a pill

00:53.820 --> 00:56.356
{\an8}that's going to be
for her to swallow?

00:56.423 --> 00:57.390
{\an8}(doorbell chimes)

00:57.457 --> 00:59.225
{\an7}All right,

{\an7}Today is going to be
hard day for you.

01:39.032 --> 01:40.567
{\an1}And it's gonna be
a hard day for her,

01:40.633 --> 01:43.169
and you're being really brave,

01:43.236 --> 01:46.072
{\an7}and I think it's--
it's important that you do it.

01:46.139 --> 01:47.507
{\an7}I think it's--

01:47.574 --> 01:50.543

{\an3}Um...

01:54.747 --> 01:57.383
As ready as I guess
I'm gonna get.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.419
{\an5}(doorbell chimes)

01:57.450 --> 01:59.419
Okay, there she is.

01:59.486 --> 02:01.654
{\an1}I'm gonna go get her.
You take a deep breath, okay?

02:01.721 --> 02:03.289
{\an3}Okay.

02:03.356 --> 02:05.725
{\an1}Okay.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.727
{\an5}(Miles)
I've been dreading
this moment for years,

02:07.794 --> 02:10.330
but I know telling Amber
the truth about my sexuality

02:10.395 --> 02:11.998
is the right thing to do.

02:12.065 --> 02:13.466
{\an8}And I'm nervous as (bleep),

02:13.533 --> 02:15.768
{\an8}because I don't know
how she gonna react.

02:15.835 --> 02:18.004
I just hope that she doesn't
hate me for this,

02:18.071 --> 02:20.273
'cause I genuinely love her.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.575
{\an5}Hi.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.575
Hi. I'm Stacy.

02:22.642 --> 02:23.676
I'm Amber,
nice to meet you.

02:23.743 --> 02:25.178
Nice to meet you,
come on in.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.248
{\an1}Have a seat on
the couch over here,

02:28.314 --> 02:30.717
this side, next to Miles.

02:30.783 --> 02:33.353
Hey.

02:30.783 --> 02:33.353
{\an3}Hey. Sup?

02:33.419 --> 02:34.454
What's up,
you look cute.

02:34.521 --> 02:37.056
{\an5}I like your boots.

02:34.521 --> 02:37.056
Thanks.

02:37.123 --> 02:38.625
I'm glad you came.

02:38.691 --> 02:41.728
{\an1}All right, Miles,
so will you share with Amber

02:41.794 --> 02:43.162
what's been going on?

02:43.229 --> 02:44.497
{\an3}Sure.

02:44.564 --> 02:48.234
{\an3}Um, well...

02:50.236 --> 02:54.374
{\an3}I love you,
um, a lot.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.009
A whole lot.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.812
{\an3}And, um...

02:59.879 --> 03:05.618
{\an1}I was just been dealing with,
like, something that I...

03:05.685 --> 03:10.223
didn't know how to deal with.

03:10.290 --> 03:14.527
Um, I was embarrassed of, um...

03:14.594 --> 03:17.864
I was humiliated of.

03:17.931 --> 03:23.136
And before I told you what
I was dealing with,

03:23.202 --> 03:28.041
I had to, um--

03:28.107 --> 03:29.642
I just had to
figure things out.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.445
{\an3}Um...

03:32.512 --> 03:36.816
I've had feelings...

03:36.883 --> 03:39.719
of attraction
towards the same sex.

03:43.856 --> 03:46.693
{\an1}Hmm.

03:46.759 --> 03:51.898
I've been having issues
with my sexual identity

03:51.965 --> 03:54.067
and my feelings
towards the same sex.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.670
And I've been in
a relationship.

03:57.737 --> 04:01.574
{\an1}(sobbing)

03:57.737 --> 04:01.574
{\an3}I've been--

04:19.692 --> 04:22.528
{\an8}I have to go to the bathroom.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.430
{\an4}Miles?

04:22.595 --> 04:24.430
I have to go to the bathroom.

04:24.497 --> 04:25.798
{\an1}Miles?

04:25.865 --> 04:27.967
Everybody was right, too.
Everybody was right.

04:28.034 --> 04:29.402
Everybody was right!

04:29.469 --> 04:31.137
Everybody was right,
everybody was right!

04:31.204 --> 04:32.872
Everybody was right, everybody!

04:32.939 --> 04:35.008
Everybody who ever said that
about you was right!

04:35.074 --> 04:36.709
Everybody!

04:36.776 --> 04:38.244
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

04:38.311 --> 04:41.014
Uh-uh, if this was a game,
then you guys can have it.

04:41.080 --> 04:47.020
(sobbing)

04:47.086 --> 04:49.989
No, let me call my mom!

04:50.056 --> 04:52.425
I wanna call my mom!

04:53.993 --> 04:58.464
I wanna call my mom!
I wanna call my mom!

05:03.236 --> 05:06.606
{\an4}(Stacy)
Miles, if you have any chance of
having a relationship with her,

05:06.673 --> 05:08.007
you have got to come out.

05:08.074 --> 05:09.108
{\an3}Okay.

05:09.175 --> 05:11.210
{\an1}You've got to come out
and talk to her.

05:11.277 --> 05:15.181
No! No!

05:15.248 --> 05:18.451
Why?
Oh, my God.

05:18.518 --> 05:19.686
Why?

05:19.752 --> 05:20.887
Look at--
She's in pain.

05:20.953 --> 05:23.189
So you need to
go be there.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.825
{\an1}I don't want to go in there,
I'm embarrassed.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.827
No. I don't wanna see--

05:27.894 --> 05:30.129
{\an1}No.

05:30.196 --> 05:31.597
{\an1}Okay, I don't want
to see them.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.266
Oh, please!
Oh, my God!

05:33.332 --> 05:38.838
{\an1}(sobbing)

05:38.905 --> 05:40.840
{\an1}Why?!

05:40.907 --> 05:42.108
{\an5}You can't run from her.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.108
But I can't--

05:42.175 --> 05:44.277
Listen to me.
Listen, okay?

05:44.343 --> 05:46.512
This is because
she loves you so much.

05:46.579 --> 05:48.281
You understand that?

05:48.347 --> 05:50.983
You can't abandon her now.
You cannot.

05:51.050 --> 05:54.053
You cannot
abandon her right now.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.054
I don't wanna go in there.

05:55.121 --> 05:56.823
No, Amber!

05:55.121 --> 05:56.823
{\an1}Stupid!

05:57.957 --> 06:01.994
Okay, let me--
Please, please.

06:02.061 --> 06:03.362
I just,
I'm ready to go, too.

06:03.429 --> 06:05.598
Okay, but you need
to hang, just hang.

06:05.665 --> 06:06.733
{\an1}I get it.

06:09.669 --> 06:12.705
Growing up in high school,
people always called him gay,

06:12.772 --> 06:15.875
{\an8}but because I loved him so much
and I trusted him

06:15.942 --> 06:17.076
{\an8}and I believed in him,

06:17.143 --> 06:18.911
{\an8}I knew that people are
just haters.

06:18.978 --> 06:21.214
The only person
that I tell everything to,

06:21.280 --> 06:24.417
I know the most
and knows everything about me

06:24.484 --> 06:27.820
is a-- is a completely different
person today.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.322
{\an5}(Amber)
Oh, my God,
this hurts so bad.

06:29.388 --> 06:30.790
{\an1}Amber.
Amber, do you see?

06:30.857 --> 06:32.825
{\an1}This is why it was so hard
for me to tell you.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.127
Leave me alone!

06:34.193 --> 06:35.762
{\an4}Amber.

06:34.193 --> 06:35.762
Leave me alone, then.

06:35.828 --> 06:36.896
{\an1}Amber.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.364
{\an5}I don't want to talk to you.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.364
I love you.

06:38.431 --> 06:39.832
I don't want to talk to you.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.901
I don't care!
I don't care!

06:41.968 --> 06:42.935
Get away from me!

06:43.002 --> 06:44.470
{\an3}All right.

06:43.002 --> 06:44.470
I love you.

06:44.537 --> 06:47.039
I'm glad. Go.
Please, go.

06:47.106 --> 06:48.775
Please, I'm serious.

06:48.841 --> 06:49.809
I'm telling (bleep)
everybody.

06:49.876 --> 06:51.177
I'm telling everybody.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.645
I'm telling everybody
that you did this.

06:52.712 --> 06:54.413
I'm telling my mom,
I'm telling everybody.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.750
Leave me alone!
Bye! Bye!

06:57.817 --> 06:59.919
Keep looking--

07:03.256 --> 07:05.091
(Miles)
I've always dreaded this moment,

07:05.158 --> 07:07.093
and seeing her hurt like this,

07:07.160 --> 07:09.162
almost makes me wish
I didn't tell her.

07:09.228 --> 07:11.364
I just hope that
she can forgive me for this

07:11.430 --> 07:14.300
and understand that this was
all for the best.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.235
(Amber)
I'm ready to go.

07:16.302 --> 07:18.304
{\an1}Can I come and sit down,
talk to you a minute?

07:18.371 --> 07:20.173
{\an1}Um...

07:20.239 --> 07:22.441
For what it's worth,

07:22.508 --> 07:26.445
{\an1}I think he's been wanting
to tell you a while, he's just--

07:26.512 --> 07:30.216
{\an1}But my thing is, have you been
doing this for a long time?

07:30.283 --> 07:31.517
{\an3}Like--

07:30.283 --> 07:31.517
{\an1}No.

07:31.584 --> 07:32.819
{\an1}And what he feels
for you is real

07:32.885 --> 07:34.754
and he loves you for real.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.989
{\an1}But I'm mad 'cause--
and he didn't tell me nothing,

07:37.056 --> 07:38.291
like, you don't--
you don't even tell me.

07:38.357 --> 07:40.026
{\an1}Because he hid it
'til he figured out

07:40.092 --> 07:41.394
how he was gonna tell you.

07:42.695 --> 07:46.933
{\an1}He has been torn
and torn and torn and torn.

07:46.999 --> 07:49.569
{\an1}And he finally had
to explain it to you.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.804
And then to me, it's like,
don't string me along

07:51.871 --> 07:53.072
this whole time.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.041
Why involve me?

07:55.107 --> 07:56.976
I've been through
a lot of things,

07:57.043 --> 07:58.778
but nothing like this.

07:58.845 --> 08:01.013
I'm thinking about
all this stuff,

08:01.080 --> 08:02.615
just everything, like,

08:02.682 --> 08:05.284
how I'm gonna tell my daughter,
how am I gonna explain to her?

08:05.351 --> 08:07.220
What is everybody
gonna say to me?

08:07.286 --> 08:09.288
Is everyone gonna laugh at me?

08:09.355 --> 08:14.827
And then, me accepting
that my future's over.

08:20.032 --> 08:22.635
Mm-mmm.
This is so wrong.

08:22.702 --> 08:24.904
This is just wrong.

08:24.971 --> 08:27.740
{\an1}Like, you know, I love you,
you love me, we're tight.

08:27.807 --> 08:29.508
You don't do this.
You don't--

08:29.575 --> 08:31.811
{\an1}you don't wait all this time
to tell me I'm just--

08:31.878 --> 08:33.479
Like, I'm in shock.

08:33.546 --> 08:34.914
I just don't know
what to think.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.148
Why won't you tell him that?

08:36.215 --> 08:37.383
{\an1}He needs to hear that.
You are right.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.284
I don't want to see him.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.553
Okay, you can't
do it right now?

08:40.620 --> 08:42.788
Maybe another day.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.788
{\an3}Yeah.

08:42.855 --> 08:43.923
Maybe another day?

08:43.990 --> 08:45.258
{\an5}Yeah, I don't want to see him.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.258
{\an1}Okay.

08:45.324 --> 08:46.826
{\an1}I want--
I do want to tell you this.

08:46.893 --> 08:48.194
I don't care.

08:46.893 --> 08:48.194
But you do.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.328
And here's the truth.

08:49.395 --> 08:50.429
Let's be honest, Amber.

08:50.496 --> 08:51.864
{\an1}If he figured this out
five years ago,

08:51.931 --> 08:52.999
you wouldn't have been happy.

08:53.065 --> 08:54.600
{\an1}Five years from now--
there was no way--

08:54.667 --> 08:57.036
{\an1}this news wasn't gonna be good
whenever it happened.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.572
I don't--
I just don't understand.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.474
But, yeah, um...

09:01.540 --> 09:03.242
This-- it's no good way
to tell that.

09:03.309 --> 09:04.477
{\an1}No.

09:04.543 --> 09:06.145
{\an1}And so I think he thought
that he was doing it

09:06.212 --> 09:08.047
the best of the worst.

09:13.085 --> 09:14.420
Just so you know,
he wants to answer

09:14.487 --> 09:17.189
{\an1}whatever you want
answered at any point.

09:17.256 --> 09:20.960
He wants to do anything he can

09:21.027 --> 09:22.862
{\an1}to make it right for you,
as right as he can.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.664
He feels terrible.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.233
{\an4}I'm telling you, he is,
you know, in there
crying about it.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.234
You know,
I don't hate him.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.402
I don't hate him.

09:29.468 --> 09:30.770
I can't hate him
for something that

09:30.836 --> 09:32.605
is inside of him,
the way he feels.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.507
I don't hate him,
I love him.

09:34.573 --> 09:35.775
Can I tell him that?

09:35.841 --> 09:37.109
But I just don't want
to deal with him.

09:37.176 --> 09:38.311
Can I tell him that?

09:38.377 --> 09:39.478
Yes, you can.
Please, tell him that.

09:39.545 --> 09:40.713
But I just don't--

09:40.780 --> 09:42.248
Right now,
I'm violent right now.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.283
{\an1}No, I think you're smart
to know that about yourself.

09:44.350 --> 09:45.584
{\an3}Yeah.

09:45.651 --> 09:48.421
{\an1}So you keep yourself safe,
don't do anything crazy.

09:48.487 --> 09:49.689
Oh, no, don't worry.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.524
But I do want to make
some phone calls,

09:51.590 --> 09:53.893
'cause there is a certain person

09:53.960 --> 09:55.461
that I do want to
ask something about.

09:55.528 --> 09:56.629
{\an1}Who?

09:56.696 --> 09:58.698
His friend Milan,
who is gay, too.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.300
Um, lately, he's been
kicking it with him,

10:01.367 --> 10:04.403
and I was thinking it
was just weird to me

10:04.470 --> 10:06.372
how they always, you know--

10:06.439 --> 10:08.374
they're around each other
all the time.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.976
{\an1}And you don't
want to ask him.

10:10.042 --> 10:11.377
No, I wouldn't,
'cause it's just like--

10:11.444 --> 10:13.679
you know, it's-- it's crazy.

10:13.746 --> 10:16.115
{\an1}Why don't you--
Why don't you ask him?

10:16.182 --> 10:17.984
I don't-- I can't--
I can't ask him today.

10:18.050 --> 10:20.252
{\an1}I mean, I would just try
and cool off tonight.

10:20.319 --> 10:22.555
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
with my mom and my sister,

10:22.621 --> 10:25.057
{\an1}you know,
and I'm gonna be with them,

10:25.124 --> 10:26.625
'cause I really need
my family right now.

10:26.692 --> 10:27.960
{\an1}I get it.

10:28.027 --> 10:30.863
{\an1}You really need to be around
people who support you,

10:30.930 --> 10:33.032
{\an1}you really need that,
'cause I know this was a blow.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.635
{\an1}All right, so I'm gonna
pass along your messages.

10:36.702 --> 10:38.070
{\an3}Thank you.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.705
{\an1}And that I'll let him know
that when you're ready to talk,

10:39.772 --> 10:41.907
{\an1}when that comes,
you'll let him know.

10:41.974 --> 10:42.975
{\an3}Okay.

10:41.974 --> 10:42.975
{\an1}All right.

10:43.042 --> 10:44.210
{\an6}Thank you.

10:43.042 --> 10:44.210
So we'll be in touch.

10:44.276 --> 10:47.246
{\an5}Okay, all right.

10:44.276 --> 10:47.246
Okay, take care.

10:50.349 --> 10:52.551
{\an3}Can we go?

10:50.349 --> 10:52.551
{\an1}Yes.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.233
{\an1}Okay, so I just
sat out in the car

11:07.299 --> 11:09.201
{\an1}and talked with her for,
like, the last 20 minutes.

11:09.268 --> 11:11.070
She's calmed down a little bit.

11:11.137 --> 11:13.272
{\an3}All right.

11:11.137 --> 11:13.272
Um, and she--

11:13.339 --> 11:14.407
{\an1}This is what she told me
to tell you.

11:14.473 --> 11:15.674
She loves you.

11:15.741 --> 11:17.643
{\an1}She doesn't hate you,
she loves you.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.045
{\an3}Okay.

11:19.111 --> 11:21.647
{\an1}She's so hurt and mad right now,
she cannot talk to you.

11:21.714 --> 11:22.681
{\an3}Okay.

11:22.748 --> 11:23.983
Though she did say

11:24.050 --> 11:27.820
{\an1}that she wants to have
a conversation eventually.

11:27.887 --> 11:29.522
But she wants her space.

11:29.588 --> 11:34.827
So there's some hope.

11:34.894 --> 11:38.097
{\an1}Um, where are you at with
what I'm telling you?

11:38.164 --> 11:39.932
{\an1}I thought I would feel better
and I feel worse.

11:39.999 --> 11:40.966
{\an3}Like...

11:41.033 --> 11:43.436
What-- how do you feel worse?

11:43.502 --> 11:46.439
I just feel like I just broke
somebody's heart into pieces,

11:46.505 --> 11:49.942
like I just ruined a woman.

11:50.009 --> 11:54.080
Um, you probably
didn't ruin her,

11:54.146 --> 11:55.681
but you did break her heart.

11:55.748 --> 11:57.750
{\an1}You did.

12:17.803 --> 12:19.872
♪♪

12:22.208 --> 12:23.742
{\an8}My butt is sweating already.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.277
{\an1}I'm (bleep) hot,
I ain't gonna lie.

12:25.344 --> 12:27.546
I'm gonna have a heat stroke,
and I'm gonna age.

12:27.613 --> 12:29.849
Everything that's been
going on between Dre and I

12:29.915 --> 12:31.450
has got me (bleep) up,

12:31.517 --> 12:33.519
so I'm looking for any excuse
to spend time with my friends

12:33.586 --> 12:34.987
and take my mind off of it.

12:35.054 --> 12:37.289
So I've agreed to do a
little workout with the girls

12:37.356 --> 12:39.258
to get all of this tight.

12:39.325 --> 12:40.259
What's been
going on, bitch?

12:40.326 --> 12:41.427
I haven't seen you.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.295
{\an1}I met up with that girl again,
at the bar.

12:43.362 --> 12:44.396
What girl?

12:44.463 --> 12:45.598
{\an1}The Nas girl
from the park, remember?

12:45.664 --> 12:46.599
Oh, the other side ho?

12:46.665 --> 12:48.567
Yeah, we both met with her.

12:48.634 --> 12:49.902
{\an6}Okay.

12:48.634 --> 12:49.902
He brought that to me,

12:49.969 --> 12:51.804
{\an7}that we should both
meet up with her.

12:51.871 --> 12:53.239
So what happened when
y'all went together?

12:53.305 --> 12:54.540
So we sit down,

12:54.607 --> 12:56.675
{\an1}then she starts talking about
some text messages.

12:56.742 --> 12:58.277
{\an1}So I asked her for her phone,
but my thing is like--

12:58.344 --> 12:59.678
Oh, no, girl.

12:59.745 --> 13:02.214
{\an1}He sat there so calm and just
let me look in her phone.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.884
{\an1}I looked at it
and he calls her.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.186
And she was at the studio
with him the night before.

13:07.253 --> 13:08.387
That's (bleep) up.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.755
{\an1}So...

13:08.454 --> 13:09.755
That's (bleep) up.

13:09.822 --> 13:11.123
So we got into a fight again.

13:11.190 --> 13:12.158
She pulled my hair,

13:12.224 --> 13:13.726
{\an1}and all I could get to
was her hair

13:13.792 --> 13:15.060
and that's how that ended.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.196
{\an8}Bitches be itching for
an ass-whooping, man.

13:17.263 --> 13:18.531
{\an8}Are y'all still together?
What's going on now?

13:18.597 --> 13:19.798
I don't know what we are.

13:19.865 --> 13:22.201
{\an1}He wants to meet
and he wants to go have dinner.

13:22.268 --> 13:23.869
Do you want to be,
after all this (bleep)?

13:23.936 --> 13:25.538
Really?

13:25.604 --> 13:27.339
{\an1}What I really want to say
is I want him to change

13:27.406 --> 13:28.641
and that's not gonna happen.

13:28.707 --> 13:30.242
My heart goes out to Nia.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.977
She really deserves
better from her man.

13:32.044 --> 13:34.013
{\an8}Now this little side chick Nas
on the other hand

13:34.079 --> 13:35.214
{\an8}needs to be checked.

13:35.281 --> 13:36.782
When Teairra and I
sat down with Nas

13:36.849 --> 13:38.551
looking for models
for our fashion show,

13:38.617 --> 13:41.153
I never thought
anything like that was going on.

13:41.220 --> 13:43.956
So now she's invited me to this
store opening that she's hosting

13:44.023 --> 13:46.258
and it seems like
the perfect opportunity

13:46.325 --> 13:48.260
to put this girl in her place.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.862
Girl, well, you know,
she invited me

13:49.929 --> 13:50.863
to her little event.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.398
{\an1}Who?

13:50.930 --> 13:52.398
{\an3}Nas.

13:52.464 --> 13:53.866
You're going?

13:53.933 --> 13:55.634
I'm gonna go and tell that
little girl about herself.

13:55.701 --> 13:57.102
I'm gonna tell her, like,

13:57.169 --> 13:59.238
you know, go find another
relationship to (bleep) up

13:59.305 --> 14:01.941
or go find another man,
'cause nobody wants you.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.709
And he's all over
the Internet with Nia,

14:03.776 --> 14:05.611
hooking up with her,
out with her publicly.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.180
It's like, girl,
you just... a nothing.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.684
♪♪

14:14.186 --> 14:17.456
{\an8}First, I walk in
on my husband surrounded

14:17.523 --> 14:21.594
{\an8}by all these trifling,
vulture-ass thirsty Beckys.

14:21.660 --> 14:27.333
Second, he comes home and throws
my wedding ring at me.

14:27.399 --> 14:30.135
Third, he has the audacity

14:30.202 --> 14:33.739
to drive off on my ass,
his wife.

14:33.806 --> 14:38.344
Needless to say, things have
been real tense around here.

14:39.712 --> 14:43.415
{\an5}What's up, cutie?

14:39.712 --> 14:43.415
Hey, my beautiful Tameka.

14:43.482 --> 14:45.784
I feel so disrespected

14:45.851 --> 14:48.654
and it is very hard for me
to forgive my husband.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.456
So I called up my girl Tiny

14:50.522 --> 14:53.459
and I asked her
to make time ASAP.

14:53.525 --> 14:55.794
{\an1}Thank God I wasn't calling you
to bail me out of jail.

14:55.861 --> 14:57.796
{\an3}What?

14:57.863 --> 14:59.198
{\an1}The other day,
I'm looking at the baby,

14:59.265 --> 15:01.667
{\an1}he playing with
something shiny on the floor.

15:01.734 --> 15:05.070
{\an1}I looked, I said,
"Oh, that's Daddy's ring."

15:05.137 --> 15:07.606
{\an1}And I said,
"I'm going to where he's at."

15:07.673 --> 15:08.607
What happened?

15:08.674 --> 15:10.342
I just bust open
the (bleep) door

15:10.409 --> 15:15.914
{\an1}and this (bleep)
is sitting down, right in there,

15:15.981 --> 15:19.685
{\an1}four girls,
and a ugly-ass Becky

15:19.752 --> 15:23.088
with her hand on his arm.

15:23.155 --> 15:24.490
Bitch, that's a no-no.

15:24.556 --> 15:26.492
I would have been,
"Girl, what?"

15:26.558 --> 15:28.761
{\an1}He does not
come home that night.

15:28.827 --> 15:29.862
{\an3}Nope.

15:29.928 --> 15:31.130
{\an1}I try to talk to him
about everything,

15:31.196 --> 15:33.232
{\an1}next thing you know,
we go from talking about it

15:33.299 --> 15:34.767
and I think he kinda listening

15:34.833 --> 15:37.002
{\an1}to him flipping t
he whole (bleep) on me.

15:37.069 --> 15:38.470
{\an5}What do you feel about--

15:37.069 --> 15:38.470
In his defense, though,

15:38.537 --> 15:39.705
in Max's defense.

15:39.772 --> 15:40.739
{\an8}Here you go.

15:40.806 --> 15:42.741
{\an8}You will blow (bleep) up

15:42.808 --> 15:45.778
{\an7}and you will do some extra
(bleep) that's not necessary.

15:45.844 --> 15:48.247
You can nag sometimes

15:48.314 --> 15:51.450
{\an1}and you can't just
point the finger all the time.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.752
You have to be able to
take some of the blame.

15:53.819 --> 15:56.822
You're a pretty
different young lady.

15:56.889 --> 15:58.223
{\an1}(laughing)

15:58.290 --> 16:01.460
Maybe Tiny is right,
I was a little bit over the top.

16:01.527 --> 16:04.463
And Max should not
have thrown his wedding ring.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.332
But if we're gonna
move forward from this,

16:06.398 --> 16:09.001
I need to be a woman
and make things right.

16:09.068 --> 16:11.003
{\an1}Our vows was,
through better or worse.

16:11.070 --> 16:12.438
And we done been through worse

16:12.504 --> 16:16.642
{\an1}and I'm willing
to work on better

16:16.709 --> 16:18.544
and not focus on the worse.

16:18.610 --> 16:19.812
Yeah, I'm all for it.

16:19.878 --> 16:22.614
If you put it into words
the right way,

16:22.681 --> 16:24.350
it could touch him.

16:24.416 --> 16:27.753
{\an1}You always get me right,
and I'm about to boss down

16:27.820 --> 16:29.555
and realize that it's me too

16:29.621 --> 16:30.556
and see how that will go.

16:30.622 --> 16:31.557
You're the boss,
though, baby.

16:31.623 --> 16:33.192
Don't let that go nowhere.

16:33.258 --> 16:34.626
{\an1}(laughing)

16:47.106 --> 16:49.675
I ain't been the same since
me and Princess broke up.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.510
And ever since I got back
from Miami

16:51.577 --> 16:53.212
and she moved
her (bleep) out the house,

16:53.278 --> 16:54.813
{\an8}that's really got me twisted.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.216
{\an8}Of course, that's when I get
a call from the last person

16:57.282 --> 16:58.517
{\an8}I needed to hear from.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.887
{\an1}I'm good,
thank you.

17:01.954 --> 17:04.522
So I asked Teairra to meet me
at our usual spot,

17:04.589 --> 17:06.592
where nobody can
get the wrong idea

17:06.657 --> 17:08.961
and there's no drinks for her
to be throwing at me.

17:11.130 --> 17:14.900
{\an8}I'm not shedding any tears now
that Princess and Ray are R-I-P.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.002
{\an8}But, what I will say
is that that bitch

17:17.069 --> 17:18.537
{\an8}shouldn't have came
at me the other day.

17:18.604 --> 17:22.007
So obviously,
Ray told her his version,

17:22.074 --> 17:23.375
and I'm pissed.

17:23.442 --> 17:26.678
So now it's my turn to give
Willie Ray Norwood

17:26.744 --> 17:29.381
a piece of my (bleep) mind.

17:29.448 --> 17:30.549
What's up with you?

17:30.616 --> 17:33.252
{\an1}I mean, I just feel like,
you know...

17:34.953 --> 17:37.256
I've known you for years.

17:37.322 --> 17:39.291
{\an1}I've never thrown you
under the bus,

17:39.358 --> 17:42.628
{\an1}never tired to humiliate you,
and it just feels like

17:42.694 --> 17:44.496
at every turn, you just, like,

17:44.563 --> 17:46.698
{\an1}try to make me
look crazy or bad.

17:46.765 --> 17:48.133
{\an5}No, I don't.

17:46.765 --> 17:48.133
And it's just like, damn,

17:48.200 --> 17:49.168
like, where is the love?

17:49.234 --> 17:50.235
Where is the loyalty?

17:50.302 --> 17:51.937
{\an1}Like, (bleep)
the romantic (bleep),

17:52.004 --> 17:54.440
{\an1}like, just speaking on
some friend (bleep).

17:54.506 --> 17:57.609
{\an1}I gave you some information
for you to marinade on

17:57.676 --> 17:58.644
and you turned it into

17:58.710 --> 18:01.280
{\an1}a complete clutter
(bleep) of mess.

18:01.346 --> 18:05.517
You tried to be Princess'
friend for a foul reason.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.186
You wasn't trying
to be her friend

18:07.252 --> 18:08.687
because you got love for her.

18:08.754 --> 18:09.855
You was trying
to be her friend

18:09.922 --> 18:11.023
just 'cause you was
trying to infiltrate

18:11.089 --> 18:12.324
and you was trying
to make a point.

18:12.391 --> 18:13.859
{\an1}I wasn't trying to be anything.
It just happened.

18:13.926 --> 18:14.960
So you really wanted
to be her friend?

18:15.027 --> 18:16.595
{\an1}It just happened
that we were friendly.

18:16.662 --> 18:17.596
Did you really want
to be her friend?

18:17.663 --> 18:19.665
And we actually could coexist

18:19.731 --> 18:22.134
{\an1}in the same room
and the same situation.

18:22.201 --> 18:23.569
It just happened.

Teairra must think
I'm stupid or something.

18:25.637 --> 18:28.407

texting me about Princess

18:28.474 --> 18:30.008
that she had a motive.

18:30.075 --> 18:31.977
She was trying to hop back
into bed with me

18:32.044 --> 18:33.946
and the whole world knows it.

18:34.012 --> 18:36.348
Like, you told me, like,
what you was trying to do.

18:36.415 --> 18:37.783
"Oh, I could take your (bleep),

18:37.850 --> 18:38.784
but I'm gonna tell you
what's going on."

18:38.851 --> 18:40.152
I never said that.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.054
Then you took the (bleep)
to Drake house.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.289
{\an5}So-- so you mad about what?

18:42.120 --> 18:44.289
I'm just saying.

18:44.356 --> 18:46.725
{\an1}'Cause I'm just
letting you know, it's cool,

18:46.792 --> 18:49.161
{\an1}I see what it is,
I see you for who you are.

18:49.228 --> 18:50.596
Like, you whack, yo.

18:50.662 --> 18:53.899
{\an1}It's like you just keep trying
to, like, take little digs.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.101
{\an5}No, you just can't
deny who you are.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.101

18:56.168 --> 18:57.836
{\an5}This is what I'm--

18:56.168 --> 18:57.836
You janky as (bleep).

19:00.672 --> 19:01.874
You trying to infiltrate me
and Princess' relationship

19:01.940 --> 19:03.242
'cause you can't be with me.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.643
{\an5}Are you kidding me?

19:03.308 --> 19:04.643
And you can't be with nobody.

got married,

wear a ring?

you know what I'm saying?

31:53.211 --> 31:55.647
{\an4}What?

31:53.211 --> 31:55.647
It might be a little better.

31:55.713 --> 31:57.015
{\an1}(laughing)

31:57.081 --> 32:00.184
Yeah, so...

32:03.755 --> 32:06.491
{\an1}I'm gonna need you to sit down
on the counter for a second.

32:06.557 --> 32:09.360
I'm giving myself some (bleep)
that I won't want to take off.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.996
Babe, oh, my God,
are you serious?

32:12.063 --> 32:14.198
Oh, my God, yay!

32:14.265 --> 32:16.000
And I got you a new one, too.

32:17.235 --> 32:20.305
{\an1}Look at the ring.
Less mouth, more ring.

32:20.371 --> 32:21.506
So you know...

32:21.572 --> 32:23.541
{\an5}Are you serious?

32:21.572 --> 32:23.541
Make it to the top.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.109
I love you.

32:26.511 --> 32:29.180
I'm never gonna ever
nag or complain again,

32:29.247 --> 32:31.649
'cause I know
what I have at home.

32:35.687 --> 32:39.290
After Nas invited me to the
store opening she was hosting,

32:39.357 --> 32:42.060
I decided to stop by and clarify
a few things for her.

32:47.732 --> 32:49.367
{\an1}Hey.

32:47.732 --> 32:49.367
How are you?

32:49.434 --> 32:50.835
Hey, thanks for coming.

32:50.902 --> 32:52.770
You're welcome.
What's going on?

32:52.837 --> 32:54.572
{\an8}T.T. and I were
gonna collaborate with Nas

32:54.639 --> 32:55.873
{\an8}for our fashion show,

32:55.940 --> 32:57.508
{\an8}but after I found out
what type of ho she was,

32:57.575 --> 32:59.310
{\an8}I was not gonna go that route.

32:59.377 --> 33:00.345
{\an7}How are you?
You look good.

33:00.411 --> 33:01.479
Thank you, I've been good.

33:01.546 --> 33:02.580
Just, you know,
busy and stuff.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.248
{\an1}What's going on
with the fashion show?

33:04.315 --> 33:05.850
{\an1}When do you want
to meet up for, you know--

33:05.917 --> 33:07.218
to get all the girls?

33:07.285 --> 33:08.252
We're not gonna
go that direction.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.320
{\an1}Okay.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.320
We already found women.

33:09.387 --> 33:10.588
Okay, that's fine.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.023
So we're gonna go
a different direction.

33:12.090 --> 33:14.025
{\an1}You know, and it's not
no shade or nothing to you,

33:14.092 --> 33:15.593
{\an1}but you know, I'm Nia's friend
at the end of the day.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.161
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

33:17.228 --> 33:18.629
{\an1}And when I met up with you,
I was like, "Oh, she's cool."

33:18.696 --> 33:20.264
{\an1}But then, like, when the
conversation started going,

33:20.331 --> 33:21.966
{\an1}you're like,
"I was asking you questions,

33:22.033 --> 33:23.267
"like, okay,
so are you guys (bleep),

33:23.334 --> 33:24.435
are y'all in a relationship?"

33:24.502 --> 33:25.670
You know, you remember.

33:24.502 --> 33:25.670
{\an1}Yeah.

33:25.737 --> 33:27.305
And I just--

33:27.372 --> 33:29.006
I don't know,
like, I mean,

33:29.073 --> 33:31.042
I don't really,
like, respect it.

33:31.109 --> 33:32.510
How do you not respect it?

33:32.577 --> 33:35.513
{\an1}You Melly Mel and Maseka
were in a situation

33:35.580 --> 33:37.482
{\an1}and you're, like,
trying to point the finger

33:37.548 --> 33:39.050
{\an1}and saying why
you don't wanna do--

33:39.117 --> 33:40.318
Because I was the girlfriend.
I wasn't in the other shoes.

33:40.385 --> 33:41.486
{\an1}And I was the girlfriend
as well.

33:41.552 --> 33:42.954
{\an5}You were in the other shoes.

33:41.552 --> 33:42.954
No, I wasn't.

33:43.020 --> 33:44.455
{\an5}(Nas)
What the (bleep)
is wrong with Nikki?

33:44.522 --> 33:46.457
{\an8}All that surgery
must have gave her amnesia,

33:46.524 --> 33:48.059
{\an8}'cause she used to be in
the same situation

33:48.126 --> 33:49.327
{\an8}that I am right now.

33:49.394 --> 33:51.295
so I have no idea
who she thinks she is,

33:51.362 --> 33:53.331
waltzing in here
trying to give me a lecture.

33:53.398 --> 33:54.799
This is the way
I feel, okay?

33:54.866 --> 33:57.869
{\an1}He's publicly on social media
with his woman, right?

33:57.935 --> 33:58.870
And you know that.

33:58.936 --> 34:00.138
{\an1}But he's still
hitting my phone,

34:00.204 --> 34:01.472
so what you fail to realize

34:01.539 --> 34:03.408
{\an1}is that you don't even know
some parts of the story.

34:03.474 --> 34:04.675
So what's the story, then?

34:04.742 --> 34:06.544
{\an1}So you need to, like--
before you start speaking

34:06.611 --> 34:07.812
{\an1}about stuff
that you don't know,

34:07.879 --> 34:08.880
{\an1}you should know
your facts first.

34:08.946 --> 34:10.181
I know my facts.

34:10.248 --> 34:11.949
{\an1}If he's openly
in a relationship with her,

34:12.016 --> 34:13.184
claiming her,

34:13.251 --> 34:14.752
then even if you
(bleep) him yesterday,

34:14.819 --> 34:15.953
even if you (bleep)
him this morning,

34:16.020 --> 34:17.321
it don't mean (bleep),

34:17.388 --> 34:19.190
{\an1}because he's still
holding hands with his lady

34:19.257 --> 34:20.491
and he's still with her.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.592
{\an1}It is what it is,
you have your opinion.

34:22.659 --> 34:23.761
Your opinion--

34:23.828 --> 34:25.463
I'm just telling you,
I feel like,

34:25.530 --> 34:26.563
you know, as a woman,

34:26.630 --> 34:28.266
you should just
value yourself more.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.570
{\an1}Well, how about you go twerk,
per usual,

34:32.637 --> 34:34.806
{\an1}on somebody else (bleep)
and stop worrying about mine.

34:34.871 --> 34:36.340
{\an1}Security, can you get her
out this store?

34:36.407 --> 34:37.341
{\an1}Okay, honey, you're getting
a little too close to me.

34:37.408 --> 34:38.443
Okay, don't touch me.

34:38.509 --> 34:39.577
{\an1}No, get--
Put your hand away from me.

34:39.643 --> 34:40.610
No, no, get out.

34:40.678 --> 34:41.679
You're not welcome anymore.

34:41.746 --> 34:42.612
{\an1}You're not gonna
tell me what to do.

34:42.679 --> 34:44.047
You can leave.

34:44.114 --> 34:44.782
{\an1}You fail to realize, you not
about to talk to me like that.

34:44.849 --> 34:46.050
You can leave.

34:46.117 --> 34:47.150
{\an1}You got a problem with me,
you can go.

34:47.217 --> 34:48.453
Get out my face, for real,

34:48.518 --> 34:49.387
{\an1}'cause you about to have
a real big problem with me

34:49.454 --> 34:50.388
if you keep getting in my face.

34:50.455 --> 34:51.656
{\an1}No.

34:50.455 --> 34:51.656
Get out my face, honey.

34:51.722 --> 34:52.989
Get out my face, baby.

34:51.722 --> 34:52.989
{\an1}No.

34:53.056 --> 34:55.193
Okay, now we really about
to have a problem.

34:55.259 --> 34:57.662
You want to touch me
one more time?

34:57.728 --> 35:00.164
{\an1}Bitch!

35:00.231 --> 35:03.601
Aww, so cute.

35:03.668 --> 35:05.002
Did you just throw up?

35:05.069 --> 35:07.738
{\an1}Yes, because your face
made me throw up, bitch.

35:07.805 --> 35:09.373
All that (bleep)
plastic surgery?

35:09.440 --> 35:10.875
{\an6}Oh, okay.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.875
All right, come on, bitch.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.410
I still look so beautiful.

35:12.477 --> 35:13.478
{\an1}Do you?

35:12.477 --> 35:13.478
{\an3}Thank you.

35:13.544 --> 35:14.879
What the (bleep) was that?

35:14.946 --> 35:16.481
I don't know if this bitch
can't hold her liquor

35:16.547 --> 35:17.615
or she might just be intimidated

35:17.682 --> 35:19.083
by the presence
of Miss Nikki Baby.

35:19.150 --> 35:21.652
But either way, honey,
that was not cute.

35:21.719 --> 35:23.754
Oh, you gonna throw
my water at me?

35:23.821 --> 35:24.989
{\an1}You lucky.

35:25.056 --> 35:26.524
Oh, I'm lucky?
Girl, bye.

35:26.591 --> 35:27.525
{\an1}(vomits)

35:27.592 --> 35:28.860
That was really cute.

35:28.926 --> 35:31.662
That's (bleeping),
keep throwing up.

35:31.729 --> 35:33.331
I would be sick too,

35:33.397 --> 35:34.765
{\an1}with all that nasty (bleep)
you got in your stomach.

35:34.832 --> 35:37.034
I still look beautiful,
and, bitch, you're a bum.

35:37.101 --> 35:40.404
{\an7}Recently, I've been
dating a guy.

35:40.471 --> 35:41.973
{\an8}You're gay?

35:42.039 --> 35:44.208
{\an7}We don't want to see our little
brother going down a path.

35:44.275 --> 35:46.878
{\an8}We want nieces and nephews.

35:46.944 --> 35:48.346
{\an8}We want to see you with a wife.

35:48.412 --> 35:49.680
{\an8}Telling you guys,

35:49.747 --> 35:51.015
{\an8}this is the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.291
♪♪

36:00.358 --> 36:05.463
♪ People don't change,
it's just temporary ♪

36:05.530 --> 36:10.601
{\an8}♪ I've always been the same,
a burden you couldn't carry ♪

36:10.668 --> 36:12.470
♪ Nothing to look forward to ♪

36:12.537 --> 36:14.872
Coming out to Amber
was the hardest thing

36:14.939 --> 36:16.040
that I've ever done,

36:16.107 --> 36:18.309
and I knew that was just
the beginning.

36:18.376 --> 36:20.011
After I told Amber the truth,

36:20.077 --> 36:21.846
she threatened
to tell my family,

36:21.913 --> 36:23.314
and that's been my greatest fear

36:23.381 --> 36:26.083
ever since I started having
these feelings as a kid.

36:26.150 --> 36:28.653
♪ I'm in too deep ♪

36:28.719 --> 36:31.756

36:41.699 --> 36:43.067
{\an1}Hiya.

36:43.134 --> 36:44.669
{\an5}Hey, how you doing?

36:43.134 --> 36:44.669
Hey, how are you?

36:44.735 --> 36:45.937
{\an3}Good.

36:46.003 --> 36:48.139
So if my family
is gonna hear this from anybody,

36:48.205 --> 36:49.440
it's gonna be me.

36:49.507 --> 36:51.976
And I know it's not
gonna be easy for 'em.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.110
Growing up,

36:53.177 --> 36:54.812
my family always
made (bleep) up remarks

36:54.879 --> 36:58.015
about same-sex relationships,
so I already know how they feel.

36:58.082 --> 37:00.985
But I owe it to myself
to finish this journey

37:01.052 --> 37:04.622
and telling my sisters
is the next step.

37:04.689 --> 37:06.791
{\an1}Hey, how's it going?
What's up?

37:06.857 --> 37:08.125
Hey.

37:08.192 --> 37:10.595
{\an7}You know, I just wanted
to talk to you guys about...

37:10.661 --> 37:14.198
{\an1}(sighs)

37:14.265 --> 37:15.499
who I've been dating

37:15.566 --> 37:17.602
{\an1}and what's been going on
in my life.

37:17.668 --> 37:20.905
{\an1}The only person I've
brought home, really, is Amber.

37:20.972 --> 37:24.575
Um, me and her, we haven't
been together for a while.

37:24.642 --> 37:25.910
{\an1}Um...

37:28.879 --> 37:32.149
Basically, um, for the past--

37:32.216 --> 37:35.553
{\an1}recently, I've been
dating a guy.

37:37.188 --> 37:40.524
{\an1}And I really didn't
know how to...

37:43.127 --> 37:44.195
tell you guys.

37:44.261 --> 37:46.063
A guy who?

37:46.130 --> 37:47.465
His name is Milan.

37:47.531 --> 37:48.833
Okay, so-- so what?

37:48.899 --> 37:50.868
So what,
are you gay?

37:50.935 --> 37:54.572
{\an1}Why do I have to be
a heterosexual,

37:54.639 --> 37:56.040
{\an5}homosexual, bisexual?

37:54.639 --> 37:56.040
Say how you feel.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.508
{\an5}Just say how you feel.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.508
Are you in love with this man?

37:57.575 --> 37:58.876
Answer the questions, Miles?

37:58.943 --> 38:00.311
{\an1}Why can't I just be a man
who fell in love with a man?

38:00.378 --> 38:02.747
Okay,
but you sleep with men?

38:02.813 --> 38:06.117
I have, yes.

38:09.353 --> 38:11.322
We have morals.

38:11.389 --> 38:13.591
So what you just saying
(bleep) God,

38:13.658 --> 38:14.959
is that what you saying?

38:15.026 --> 38:16.360
Not at all.

38:16.427 --> 38:18.496
What are you saying?

38:18.562 --> 38:20.431
{\an1}I don't think you guys
can understand the pressure

38:20.498 --> 38:23.968
{\an1}and the weight that
I have held on my chest.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.370
{\an1}I'm really the only man
in our family.

38:26.437 --> 38:28.673
{\an1}I don't have a dad,
you guys don't have a dad.

38:28.739 --> 38:31.575
{\an1}My biggest fear was
disappointing you guys,

38:31.642 --> 38:32.810
disappointing Mom,

38:32.877 --> 38:35.246
{\an1}disappointing my sisters,
disappointing--

38:35.312 --> 38:38.082
So you don't think
that this is doing that?

38:38.149 --> 38:41.719
And I know it's probably
easier said than done,

38:41.786 --> 38:45.289
but we are your family.

38:45.356 --> 38:46.624
We don't want to see
our little brother,

38:46.691 --> 38:48.192
you're our only brother
that we have,

38:48.259 --> 38:49.393
and we don't want to see
our little brother

38:49.460 --> 38:50.995
going down a path.

38:51.062 --> 38:54.999
{\an1}We want nieces and nephews,
we want to see you with a wife.

38:55.066 --> 38:56.133
We want to see you--

38:56.200 --> 38:57.101
{\an1}I didn't know I could
come to you guys,

38:57.168 --> 38:58.903
{\an1}I don't want
to disappoint Mom.

38:58.969 --> 39:01.105
You should make
better decisions, Miles.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.174
{\an1}It's killing me
telling you guys.

39:03.240 --> 39:04.642
How you think
they gonna look at you,

39:04.709 --> 39:06.177
you know what I'm saying?

39:06.243 --> 39:08.312
Telling you guys is the hardest
thing I've ever done in my life.

39:08.379 --> 39:09.480
Dealing with this.

39:09.547 --> 39:10.715
{\an1}I don't know why
I have these feelings,

39:10.781 --> 39:13.184
I don't know,
I don't know.

39:13.250 --> 39:15.419
{\an1}For me to have
these feelings has been hard

39:15.486 --> 39:20.925
{\an1}and I haven't told anybody,
I held them in.

39:20.991 --> 39:23.427
It's gonna be okay, okay?
It's gonna be okay.

39:23.494 --> 39:25.196
{\an1}I've wanted to kill myself
behind this, like--

39:25.262 --> 39:27.364
Well, don't talk about death,
okay, please?

39:27.431 --> 39:30.901
{\an1}At the end of the day,
we gonna support you, okay?

39:30.968 --> 39:32.903
{\an5}You my brother.

39:30.968 --> 39:32.903
We're blood.

39:32.970 --> 39:35.139
{\an1}I will ride or die for you,
regardless.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.841
Yup.

39:36.907 --> 39:38.476
{\an5}Why do I feel like this?

39:36.907 --> 39:38.476
It's gonna be okay, look.

39:38.542 --> 39:39.977
{\an1}I don't--
I don't get it.

39:40.044 --> 39:44.381
It's gonna be okay, okay?
It's gonna be okay.

39:48.652 --> 39:49.854
{\an3}Thank you.

39:49.920 --> 39:51.155
I love you guys.

39:51.222 --> 39:54.458
We will always be here
for you regardless.

39:56.026 --> 39:57.728
You will always
be our baby brother.

40:03.901 --> 40:07.071
{\an8}The road to acceptance
can be a tough one to travel.

40:07.138 --> 40:11.308
{\an8}If you or someone you know
is struggling with who they are

40:11.375 --> 40:13.978
{\an8}or needs support to come out
to friends and family,

40:14.044 --> 40:15.946
{\an8}you're not alone.

Next time on
"Love &amp; Hip-Hop: Hollywood"...

40:26.357 --> 40:28.092
{\an8}I look like a (bleep) monster.

40:28.159 --> 40:30.694
{\an7}This is how we make our money,
you know what I'm saying?

40:30.761 --> 40:32.363
{\an8}Get your ass into the courtroom,

40:32.429 --> 40:35.866
{\an8}get full custody and let her
pay you and go hire a nanny.

40:35.933 --> 40:38.469
{\an7}If you gonna be a parent
to Moniece, Marla,

40:38.536 --> 40:41.505
{\an8}I feel like you should support
her through her demise, period.

40:41.572 --> 40:43.674
{\an8}You don't care!

40:41.572 --> 40:43.674
{\an8}Stop, stop it.

40:43.741 --> 40:45.109
{\an8}You have never cared!

40:45.176 --> 40:46.944
{\an8}Not until yesterday
did I get a glimpse

40:47.011 --> 40:49.146
{\an7}that you do not have
a support system.

40:49.213 --> 40:50.447
{\an8}You're attacking me

40:50.514 --> 40:52.383
{\an7}and I'm the one that's been
helping all this time.

40:52.449 --> 40:55.352
{\an8}I am 100% ready.

40:55.419 --> 40:57.822
{\an8}If you don't show
your professionalism,

40:57.888 --> 40:59.290
{\an8}I'm not gonna
pay attention to it.

40:59.356 --> 41:03.627
{\an7}I hear so many things about
this guy with other women and--

41:03.694 --> 41:04.795
{\an8}People say stuff.

41:04.862 --> 41:06.230
{\an8}You know that
more than anybody.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.599
{\an7}I just really feel like
you deserve better.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.070
{\an8}You stated that you had
some things to tell me.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.271
