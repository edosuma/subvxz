00:01.740 --> 00:03.786
<i>Previously on "Superman Lois"...</i>

00:03.786 --> 00:05.396
I said don't make everything
about you; it's selfish.

00:05.396 --> 00:07.268
I'm selfish? You know what?
Go to your room.

00:07.268 --> 00:08.921
It's probably why Dad
cheated on you.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.448
Oh, hey.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.015
I just found out
I have cancer.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.538
Please, Dr. Irons,
I just need to know

00:16.538 --> 00:18.670
if your brother might have
had some connection

00:18.670 --> 00:20.324
<i>to Bruno Mannheim.</i>

00:20.324 --> 00:22.326
By selling tech and weapons.

00:22.326 --> 00:23.893
<i>What were you thinking?</i>

00:23.893 --> 00:25.677
<i>You know that Mannheim
or anyone from Intergang</i>

00:25.677 --> 00:27.592
<i>wouldn't think twice
about killing you.</i>

00:29.246 --> 00:30.943
Ah, I've been wanting
to try these out.

00:30.943 --> 00:33.033
<i>We need to talk
about the blood you found.</i>

00:33.033 --> 00:35.687
- Whose blood was it?
- Yours.

00:41.693 --> 00:43.695
Let's go!
Let's go!

00:43.695 --> 00:44.870
Go! Go! Go!

00:50.920 --> 00:53.227
<i>Rescue 1,
how's it look up there?</i>

00:53.227 --> 00:55.229
<i>Did we get everyone out?</i>

00:55.229 --> 00:56.926
<i>Hotshot, that's a negative.</i>

00:56.926 --> 00:59.581
<i>Our spotters see headlights
way up on Sawmill Road.</i>

00:59.581 --> 01:01.061
<i>Looks like it could be an RV.</i>

01:10.244 --> 01:11.767
Look out!

01:24.867 --> 01:26.216
The smoke's too thick.

01:26.216 --> 01:27.609
I can barely see.

02:00.337 --> 02:02.296
Everyone's gone.
We're safe.

02:04.472 --> 02:05.995
What?

02:05.995 --> 02:07.127
It's your mom.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.217
Dad, I can handle this.

02:11.435 --> 02:14.656
I'll yell if anything happens.

02:14.656 --> 02:16.658
Start with the perimeter,
then you work your way in.

02:17.659 --> 02:18.747
Be careful.

02:24.318 --> 02:25.710
Lois?

02:26.755 --> 02:28.409
Lois, are you--

02:29.714 --> 02:30.976
OK.

02:30.976 --> 02:32.413
Just clumsy.

02:32.413 --> 02:33.892
And for the record,
you don't get

02:33.892 --> 02:35.851
to use your super-hearing
to keep tabs on me

02:35.851 --> 02:37.331
just because I'm sick.

02:53.738 --> 02:54.957
Eggs?

02:54.957 --> 02:57.089
Not hungry.

02:58.874 --> 03:01.311
- Dude, just give it back.
- Get out of my room!

03:02.530 --> 03:04.706
Be right be back.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.142
Oh, my God!
This is mine!

03:06.142 --> 03:07.535
Dude, just let me
wear it one day.

03:07.535 --> 03:08.884
You have a thousand
just like it.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.712
Not in this color, all right?
I told you!

03:10.712 --> 03:12.583
- What is wrong with you two?
- He stole my hoodie.

03:12.583 --> 03:16.283
- It's not his!
- Both of you stop--right now.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.328
Your mother just had her first
round of chemo yesterday.

03:18.328 --> 03:20.983
Today she needs to recover
in peace and quiet,

03:20.983 --> 03:22.593
so what she's not
gonna listen to all day

03:22.593 --> 03:24.378
is the two of you up here
fighting over a sweater.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.857
Understood?

03:25.857 --> 03:27.511
- Right.
- Yeah.

03:27.511 --> 03:28.730
You know, maybe you guys
just go do something

03:28.730 --> 03:30.471
outside the house
today, huh?

03:30.471 --> 03:32.037
In case she needs to nap
or she's not feeling well?

03:32.037 --> 03:34.431
Yeah, I can head over
to Candice's or something.

03:34.431 --> 03:35.911
I guess Grandpa
wanted to go fishing.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.391
Great.
Great.

03:37.391 --> 03:38.870
Off you go. Godspeed.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.437
If you need something,
text me, not your mom.

03:40.437 --> 03:43.658
Do not bother your mother
with anything.

03:46.051 --> 03:47.836
- Idiot.
- Dumbass.

03:57.802 --> 04:00.631
- I know what you're thinking.
- That we had a deal?

04:00.631 --> 04:03.678
I am just reading
this amazing article

04:03.678 --> 04:06.811
about how Bruno Mannheim
invested $200 million

04:06.811 --> 04:09.074
in Hob's Bay Medical Center
five years ago,

04:09.074 --> 04:11.860
the very same hospital
where Dr. Aleister Hook

04:11.860 --> 04:13.601
allegedly treated
Intergang members.

04:13.601 --> 04:15.951
It seems like Mannheim
had the run of the place.

04:15.951 --> 04:17.431
Hmm.

04:17.431 --> 04:19.128
We're not doing that today.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.303
No researching.

04:20.303 --> 04:22.218
No emailing.
No phone calls.

04:22.218 --> 04:23.654
Today is officially rest day.

04:23.654 --> 04:25.482
Mannheim has
your blood, Clark.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.441
Yeah, and he'll
still have it tomorrow.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.834
So what are we gonna binge?

04:29.834 --> 04:31.923
I was thinking
"Alien Ancestors."

04:33.185 --> 04:34.839
I have enough aliens
in my life.

04:34.839 --> 04:36.928
I was thinking
"Forensic Confessions."

04:36.928 --> 04:39.453
Oh. Mm-hmm.

04:41.324 --> 04:42.325
Let's go.

04:44.153 --> 04:45.807
- Dad!
- Hey!

04:45.807 --> 04:48.070
Did you have to buy
the loudest blender they had?

04:48.070 --> 04:49.463
Hey, listen.

04:49.463 --> 04:50.899
You sleep here,
you're gonna wake up

04:50.899 --> 04:52.466
at a reasonable hour,
all right?

04:52.466 --> 04:54.076
Your definition
of reasonable

04:54.076 --> 04:55.686
is unreasonable.

04:59.690 --> 05:04.347
You, um--you ready to talk
about what happened last night?

05:09.570 --> 05:11.702
Well, you gonna answer that?

05:15.053 --> 05:16.577
Dad.

05:16.577 --> 05:17.969
Hey.

05:17.969 --> 05:19.188
<i>Can you please
hand Sarah the phone?</i>

05:19.188 --> 05:21.843
Yeah. One sec.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.459
Sarah.
- I don't wanna talk to her.

05:29.459 --> 05:30.765
You don't hang up
on your mother.

05:30.765 --> 05:32.332
She shouldn't
have slapped me.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.508
Whoa.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.597
She--she slapped you?

05:36.597 --> 05:38.468
That's why I was
so upset last night.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.602
Wow, um...

05:44.996 --> 05:46.084
What happened?

05:46.084 --> 05:47.172
She came home all pissy

05:47.172 --> 05:48.478
that you had asked her

05:48.478 --> 05:50.219
about Mr. Irons, and then--

05:50.219 --> 05:51.481
Oh, hell.

05:51.481 --> 05:52.787
She's just been
so pushy lately,

05:52.787 --> 05:55.529
and then I called her out
on it, and--

05:56.878 --> 05:58.923
Listen, I'm--

05:58.923 --> 06:01.883
I'm sorry that you're stuck
in the middle of this, mijita.

06:01.883 --> 06:03.537
I am.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.408
That should've never
happened, though.

06:07.758 --> 06:11.109
And I'm gonna make sure
it never does again.

06:11.109 --> 06:12.850
Hey, I'm coming over.

06:18.029 --> 06:19.509
<i>Render complete.</i>

06:19.509 --> 06:20.902
And the energy source
for the gauntlets?

06:20.902 --> 06:22.730
<i>It appears
the main source of power</i>

06:22.730 --> 06:25.254
<i>was plasma propulsion.</i>

06:25.254 --> 06:27.038
It used ion thrusters?

06:27.038 --> 06:29.389
<i>That is correct.</i>

06:33.218 --> 06:35.569
Deploy posterior drives.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.539
- Hey, John.
- Uh, sorry,

06:49.539 --> 06:51.149
your--your phones went
straight to voice mail.

06:51.149 --> 06:52.412
Oh, yeah, I'm, uh,

06:52.412 --> 06:53.630
forcing Lois
to relax today.

06:53.630 --> 06:56.067
I assumed,
but this couldn't wait.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.242
What's going on?

06:57.242 --> 06:58.635
OK, look, um,

06:58.635 --> 06:59.941
the kryptonite gauntlets
used against you

06:59.941 --> 07:01.595
at the warehouse,
something about

07:01.595 --> 07:02.857
how they were made
looked familiar,

07:02.857 --> 07:05.250
so I analyzed
the construction.

07:05.250 --> 07:09.907
Clark, I think that tech was
made by the me of this Earth.

07:09.907 --> 07:11.518
If there's more out there,
if--

07:11.518 --> 07:13.215
if Intergang
is really using tech

07:13.215 --> 07:15.609
that John Irons made, maybe--

07:15.609 --> 07:17.175
maybe Diggle was right.

07:17.175 --> 07:19.351
Maybe there is a connection
between Bruno Mannheim

07:19.351 --> 07:22.093
and my doppelganger's death.

07:22.093 --> 07:25.183
Yeah, um...

07:25.183 --> 07:27.142
We know.

07:27.142 --> 07:28.970
What--what--
what do you mean you know?

07:30.493 --> 07:31.973
Look, the whole reason
Lois and Chrissy

07:31.973 --> 07:33.801
were at that medical facility
in the first place

07:33.801 --> 07:37.805
is because we--we've kind of
been investigating Mannheim.

07:37.805 --> 07:39.633
I asked you
to leave it alone.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.199
Lois and Mannheim
have a history.

07:41.199 --> 07:42.897
She thought if she could prove
he killed your doppelganger,

07:42.897 --> 07:44.420
we could finally
put him behind bars,

07:44.420 --> 07:47.771
so, uh, she went to talk
to Dr. Irons.

07:47.771 --> 07:49.643
Lois talked to my sister?

07:49.643 --> 07:50.948
Why would she do that?

07:50.948 --> 07:52.515
Darlene already
lost her brother.

07:52.515 --> 07:55.126
She doesn't need
to get dragged into this.

07:55.126 --> 07:57.477
Hey, John.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.087
Is everything OK?

07:59.957 --> 08:01.437
Nothing that can't wait.

08:01.437 --> 08:04.135
I need to get back to the shop.

08:04.135 --> 08:06.355
Feel better.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.244
Uh...

08:26.244 --> 08:29.117
Mr. Pergande.

08:29.117 --> 08:31.554
Is, uh, Candice here?

08:31.554 --> 08:33.295
I sent her on a run.

08:33.295 --> 08:37.081
Before she gets back,
maybe you and me should chat.

08:37.081 --> 08:38.779
About what?

08:38.779 --> 08:40.389
Well, I don't know.

08:40.389 --> 08:43.044
Is there anything
you and I need to discuss?

08:45.220 --> 08:46.438
This is about my truck.

08:46.438 --> 08:48.702
I don't know
anything about that.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.660
But I sure as hell
don't need you spreading

08:50.660 --> 08:52.575
any more lies about me.

08:54.098 --> 08:56.884
- I'm not spreading any lies.
- Really?

08:56.884 --> 08:59.539
'Cause I heard you thought
I was dealing X-K,

08:59.539 --> 09:01.366
which just isn't true.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.194
See, I'm not
that kind of person.

09:03.194 --> 09:04.544
You hear me?

09:04.544 --> 09:05.545
Hey!

09:05.545 --> 09:07.111
I said do you hear me?

09:08.809 --> 09:10.071
You stole my truck.

09:10.071 --> 09:12.290
- What'd you say?
- You stole it.

09:12.290 --> 09:13.596
And you took it to a chop shop.

09:13.596 --> 09:14.641
Look, I know it was you.

09:14.641 --> 09:15.642
The hell I did!

09:15.642 --> 09:17.426
You had my mom's watch.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.036
- Better shut your mouth.
- Oh, what, you don't want

09:19.036 --> 09:21.909
everyone hearing
that you're a crap dad?

09:22.866 --> 09:25.042
I don't like liars.

09:25.042 --> 09:28.263
Keep it up,
you'll get more than my fist.

09:36.445 --> 09:37.577
I cannot imagine marrying

09:37.577 --> 09:38.926
into this family;
they are awful.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.106
What is it?

09:45.106 --> 09:46.194
Mm, nothing.

09:46.194 --> 09:49.719
- Clark.
- I think we need popcorn.

09:49.719 --> 09:52.417
Mm, the kernels always
get stuck in my teeth.

09:52.417 --> 09:53.723
Oh, come on,
it'll be like

09:53.723 --> 09:55.159
our movie nights
back in Metropolis.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.813
- I'm fine, really.
- Look, I'm just gonna go

09:56.813 --> 09:58.902
to Brit and Dunn's real quick.
- For popcorn?

09:58.902 --> 10:01.122
Yeah, I'll be back
before they solve the case.

10:03.951 --> 10:07.258
It's clearly
the father-in-law.

10:07.258 --> 10:08.999
<i>It was wrong
not to say anything.</i>

10:08.999 --> 10:10.435
You had no business
keeping that from me.

10:10.435 --> 10:11.915
We were just trying
not to upset you.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.613
I don't need you
to protect my feelings.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.703
What I need is for you
and Lois to listen

10:16.703 --> 10:18.269
when I ask you
not to do something.

10:18.269 --> 10:21.011
I know.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.099
I'm sorry.

10:25.537 --> 10:31.021
OK, what exactly did Darlene
say about the other me?

10:31.021 --> 10:33.067
That her family believes
he was selling weapons

10:33.067 --> 10:34.503
to people like Bruno Mannheim.

10:34.503 --> 10:36.374
Yeah,
which we now to be true.

10:39.334 --> 10:40.422
You're not him.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.294
Was there anything else?

10:44.556 --> 10:46.515
Your sister is the one
who encouraged Lois

10:46.515 --> 10:48.038
to get those tests.

10:48.038 --> 10:49.213
If it wasn't for her,

10:49.213 --> 10:50.824
we wouldn't know
about the cancer.

10:53.087 --> 10:56.003
She was always
a great doctor.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.094
- Where you going?
- To talk with my sister.

11:00.094 --> 11:01.356
Whoa, she doesn't know
you exist.

11:01.356 --> 11:02.749
But Bruno Mannheim might.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.012
That assassin of his
saw me at Lana's office.

11:05.012 --> 11:06.448
What if they come
looking for me?

11:06.448 --> 11:08.058
If I'm gonna keep Nat safe,

11:08.058 --> 11:09.407
I need to know everything I can

11:09.407 --> 11:11.409
about the me of this Earth.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.679
- Why are we stopping here?
- You and I need to talk.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.855
Here. Take a look.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.032
These from last night?

11:25.032 --> 11:26.990
See anything there
you should be alarmed about?

11:28.035 --> 11:29.863
I mean, my hood fell down

11:29.863 --> 11:31.516
for, like, a second,
but you can't even see my face.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.040
I can see your hair,

11:33.040 --> 11:35.695
which is why you're
getting it cut.

11:37.479 --> 11:39.002
You're not serious.

11:39.002 --> 11:41.048
That curly mop
is just a big billboard

11:41.048 --> 11:43.050
telling the world
who you really are.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.791
Then--then I'll be
more careful.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.749
Nope.
Can't take that risk.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.838
Look, first thing
we do at the DOD

11:48.838 --> 11:50.797
is give recruits
the old high and tight.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.494
Yeah, but I'm not a recruit.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.322
And besides, my dad never had
to do anything like that.

11:54.322 --> 11:56.106
That's because he didn't
look like he was

11:56.106 --> 11:58.065
auditioning for Thin Lizzy.

11:58.065 --> 12:00.632
Your father understood
the best disguise

12:00.632 --> 12:04.811
was to just blend in--
that and the glasses.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.551
- I'm not doing it.
- Don't be stubborn.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.336
This is important.
- No. No.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.599
If my dad wanted me to cut
my hair, he would have told me.

12:10.599 --> 12:12.427
He's got enough
on his plate right now.

12:12.427 --> 12:13.776
Both your parents do.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.256
This isn't about them.

12:15.256 --> 12:17.737
No, this is about you
being responsible enough

12:17.737 --> 12:19.347
to be a hero.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.438
Like you even know
what that means.

12:23.438 --> 12:26.093
Don't you disrespect me
like that.

12:26.093 --> 12:30.227
I'm a four-star general
in the U.S. Armed Forces!

12:37.060 --> 12:40.324
- That was fast.
- Just me, Mom.

12:40.324 --> 12:41.804
You're not even
gonna say hello?

12:41.804 --> 12:43.719
Hi.

12:43.719 --> 12:45.025
Now can I go to my room?

12:45.025 --> 12:46.678
- Get down here.
- Mom.

12:46.678 --> 12:48.245
Now.

12:54.991 --> 12:56.036
What happened?

12:56.036 --> 12:57.428
- - It's fine.
- I just--

12:57.428 --> 12:59.953
I took an elbow
playing basketball.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.695
That looks like
more than an elbow.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.654
Did you get into a fight?
- No, OK?

13:05.654 --> 13:06.960
Just stop.
It's fine.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.309
Jonathan,
what aren't you telling me?

13:11.442 --> 13:13.270
Dad said not
to bother you today.

13:13.270 --> 13:14.706
- He said that?
- OK, no.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.708
It's--this isn't helping, OK?

13:16.708 --> 13:19.189
Just please,
just watch your show.

13:19.189 --> 13:20.974
I'm fine.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.326
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

13:25.326 --> 13:26.675
<i>Lana, what were you
thinking?</i>

13:26.675 --> 13:28.503
- I wasn't.
- You know, we--

13:28.503 --> 13:30.287
we both promised
each other that we would never

13:30.287 --> 13:32.986
lay a hand on our kids,
especially after everything

13:32.986 --> 13:34.726
that your mom put you through.

13:34.726 --> 13:37.425
Look, I know.

13:37.425 --> 13:38.687
I lost control.

13:38.687 --> 13:40.428
There's no excuse.

13:42.082 --> 13:45.650
OK.
Then I'm glad to hear that.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.957
You know, Sarah--

13:47.957 --> 13:51.004
Sarah should've never
called you pushy.

13:51.004 --> 13:53.833
That's not why I slapped her.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.051
Well, then what was it?

13:55.051 --> 13:57.358
Uh, let's not even go there.

13:57.358 --> 14:00.013
No, Lana, I think I deserve
to know what happened.

14:02.232 --> 14:05.496
Sarah said it was my fault
you cheated on me.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.196
She said what?

14:09.196 --> 14:12.939
She called me selfish and
said that's why you cheated.

14:12.939 --> 14:15.028
You know that's not true,
right, Lana?

14:15.028 --> 14:16.116
Look, it doesn't matter.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.378
It does matter to me.

14:17.378 --> 14:19.206
She was just
trying to hurt me.

14:19.206 --> 14:21.556
She should've never thrown
my mistakes in your face.

14:23.384 --> 14:25.473
OK?
You don't deserve that.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.218
I just wish that I could
tell her how sorry I am.

14:33.785 --> 14:36.614
OK. Good.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.965
I'm gonna hold you to that.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.098
OK, got some popcorn,

14:42.098 --> 14:44.535
and I got some of those
gummy worms you like.

14:44.535 --> 14:47.060
Clark, it doesn't take
that long to get gummy worms.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.366
Where were you?

14:51.629 --> 14:53.370
Went to John Henry's.

14:53.370 --> 14:54.937
I knew something
was up earlier.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.547
You have the worst poker face.

14:56.547 --> 14:57.766
I know. I know.

14:57.766 --> 14:59.202
Look, he just discovered
Bruno's tech

14:59.202 --> 15:01.074
was made by the other
John Henry, so I...

15:01.074 --> 15:02.814
told him about your visit
with his sister.

15:02.814 --> 15:04.077
You told him that without me?

15:04.077 --> 15:05.774
It's fine.
I smoothed it over.

15:05.774 --> 15:07.515
Clark, I don't need you
cleaning up my messes.

15:07.515 --> 15:09.125
We are a team;
you don't get to have

15:09.125 --> 15:11.084
those discussions without me.
- OK, Lois--

15:11.084 --> 15:12.476
And also, you don't get
to tell our boys

15:12.476 --> 15:14.261
not to bother me
with their problems.

15:14.261 --> 15:17.264
I am their mother.
Their problems are my problems.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.787
OK, babe, babe,
I just thought

15:18.787 --> 15:20.049
you could use a break
from all the headaches.

15:20.049 --> 15:21.181
From having two teenagers

15:21.181 --> 15:22.573
who are constantly messing up?

15:22.573 --> 15:24.271
That's not gonna change
because I'm sick.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.621
Jonathan just came home
with a black eye

15:26.621 --> 15:28.188
the size of Australia.

15:28.188 --> 15:30.320
- Was he in a fight?
- Probably.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.148
I don't know;
he wouldn't tell me

15:32.148 --> 15:33.454
because you have him acting

15:33.454 --> 15:35.151
like I'm too fragile
to handle it,

15:35.151 --> 15:39.025
which is exactly what
I didn't wanna have happen.

15:39.025 --> 15:42.898
I am a mother and a wife
and a reporter.

15:42.898 --> 15:45.379
Cancer doesn't change me.

15:46.771 --> 15:49.992
Telling people to treat me
differently is not OK.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.953
I--I'm--I'm sorry.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.824
It's all right.

15:55.824 --> 15:58.827
Now let's go make sure
our son hasn't joined

15:58.827 --> 16:00.524
some stupid fight club.

16:06.617 --> 16:08.184
You are gonna tell us
who did this to you right now.

16:08.184 --> 16:10.012
- But, Mom--
- Don't "But, Mom" me.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.579
This is a big deal.
You were attacked.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.711
I know; I just don't wanna
stress you out.

16:13.711 --> 16:14.799
You're--

16:14.799 --> 16:16.323
Sick?

16:16.323 --> 16:19.282
Yes, I am, but that's not
an excuse to exclude me

16:19.282 --> 16:21.893
from knowing what is going on
in my own family.

16:21.893 --> 16:24.287
Your mom's right, and I was
wrong to tell you otherwise.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.768
So what happened?

16:28.291 --> 16:30.859
I--I guess it started
a few days ago

16:30.859 --> 16:32.339
when my truck was stolen.

16:32.339 --> 16:33.993
- Who stole your truck?
- Your truck got stolen?

16:33.993 --> 16:35.864
Do you guys know that Grandpa
wants me to cut my hair?

16:35.864 --> 16:37.866
Did you know that Jonathan's
truck got stolen?

16:37.866 --> 16:39.085
What happened to your face?

16:39.085 --> 16:40.173
Jordan, you heard
your father.

16:40.173 --> 16:42.610
Did you know about the truck?

16:43.741 --> 16:45.178
I mean, I--

16:45.178 --> 16:47.658
Sit down.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.836
It's your dad.
Something's come up at the DOD.

16:51.836 --> 16:53.795
Go.
I've got this.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.712
Now, start with the truck.

16:59.801 --> 17:01.846
You're not gonna like this.

17:01.846 --> 17:03.022
Clear the room.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.501
You heard the general.

17:04.501 --> 17:05.589
Everybody up.

17:13.336 --> 17:15.121
I've been looking
into how Mannheim

17:15.121 --> 17:17.297
got his hands on your blood.

17:17.297 --> 17:18.341
And?

17:18.341 --> 17:20.865
It came from the DOD.

17:20.865 --> 17:23.259
How is that even possible?

17:23.259 --> 17:24.956
When you were hospitalized

17:24.956 --> 17:26.654
after Ally Allston
attacked you.

17:26.654 --> 17:29.265
Whoa, the DOD took my blood
while I was unconscious?

17:29.265 --> 17:30.919
They were trying
to save your life.

17:30.919 --> 17:33.269
It was medically necessary.
- At that time.

17:33.269 --> 17:35.228
What have they been
doing with it since then?

17:36.751 --> 17:39.754
I don't know.

17:39.754 --> 17:42.278
How could you lie
to me like that?

17:42.278 --> 17:43.975
I didn't lie.

17:43.975 --> 17:47.414
OK, so you just told me
part of the story, then.

17:47.414 --> 17:50.025
She hit me.
What does the rest even matter?

17:50.025 --> 17:51.548
Because of what
you said, Sarah.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.898
You tried to weaponize
my affair

17:53.898 --> 17:55.596
just to, what,
hurt her?

17:55.596 --> 17:57.772
So that makes
her slapping me OK?

17:58.860 --> 18:01.123
No. No.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.560
No, it--it does not.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.953
OK?

18:04.953 --> 18:08.087
Look, your mama feels terrible
about what happened,

18:08.087 --> 18:10.089
and--and she--

18:10.089 --> 18:11.742
she wants to apologize.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.614
Yeah, probably to make
herself feel better.

18:13.614 --> 18:16.138
Sarah,
she wants to fix this.

18:18.445 --> 18:20.621
Your mama loves you
very much.

18:22.753 --> 18:24.755
Then how could she
do that to me?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.240
You know it was her
that found you

18:31.240 --> 18:33.764
the night that you
tried to--

18:33.764 --> 18:35.157
tried to hurt yourself?

18:35.157 --> 18:37.246
Dad, what does that have
to do with anything?

18:38.465 --> 18:41.772
You were on the floor, unconscious,

18:41.772 --> 18:45.994
and she called 911,
but then--

18:45.994 --> 18:47.430
then you stopped breathing.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.650
And when the help arrived,

18:49.650 --> 18:53.393
they found her on her knees,
giving you CPR...

18:53.393 --> 18:54.611
Dad.

18:54.611 --> 18:58.093
Trying to save
her child's life.

18:58.093 --> 19:02.315
And even when the doctors told
her that you were gonna be OK,

19:02.315 --> 19:04.882
she did not leave your side.

19:06.449 --> 19:12.020
It's just...
everything's changed.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.326
I know.

19:13.326 --> 19:18.157
You don't live
with us anymore, and...

19:18.157 --> 19:21.029
I just see Mom differently.

19:21.029 --> 19:23.814
Look, mija, your mama
made a big mistake.

19:23.814 --> 19:26.252
All right? She--she did.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.341
But you wouldn't wanna
be judged

19:28.341 --> 19:30.691
on your worst day,
now, would you?

19:33.476 --> 19:37.263
So maybe let's not judge
your mom on hers, OK?

19:48.056 --> 19:49.579
Dr. Irons?

19:49.579 --> 19:50.624
- Oh!
- I'm not your brother.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.408
I'm--I'm not your brother.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.628
I look like him, but I'm--

19:54.628 --> 19:58.675
I'm a different person
from a different world.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.331
Like the place
with the square sun?

20:02.331 --> 20:03.854
Yeah.

20:03.854 --> 20:05.943
Something like that.

20:05.943 --> 20:08.294
I'm friends with Lois Lane.

20:08.294 --> 20:09.730
I know what you said
about your brother.

20:09.730 --> 20:12.298
I just need to know
more about him.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.691
I have nothing else
to say about that.

20:14.691 --> 20:17.825
Please,
please, please.

20:17.825 --> 20:21.263
I may not be your brother, but...

20:21.263 --> 20:23.613
I have a daughter.

20:23.613 --> 20:27.051
And if I'm gonna raise her
on this world

20:27.051 --> 20:28.270
where a guy who looks like me

20:28.270 --> 20:30.577
was murdered
by Bruno Mannheim...

20:32.318 --> 20:34.189
I need more information.

20:34.189 --> 20:37.323
All I know is, when my
brother got out of the service,

20:37.323 --> 20:39.107
things were good
for a while.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.500
And then they weren't.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.633
John became distant, paranoid.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.722
Then my dad heard
from an old army friend

20:45.722 --> 20:48.247
that he was selling
military weapons on the side.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.770
He heard?

20:49.770 --> 20:50.988
It wasn't a rumor.

20:50.988 --> 20:54.427
When my dad confronted John,
he didn't deny it.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.080
I loved my brother.

20:56.080 --> 21:00.302
More than anything,
I wanted my dad to be wrong.

21:01.695 --> 21:03.871
But then John
shut me out of his life.

21:03.871 --> 21:09.355
He told me that I would
be better off without him.

21:09.355 --> 21:12.488
Six months later,
he was murdered.

21:14.229 --> 21:15.796
I'm sorry.

21:15.796 --> 21:17.754
I, um--

21:17.754 --> 21:19.800
I knew this would be difficult.

21:23.369 --> 21:26.023
Except for the scar,

21:26.023 --> 21:28.374
you look just like him.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.985
You're a dead ringer
for my Darlene.

21:33.161 --> 21:36.120
Back in my world,
we were really close.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.252
Same here.

21:37.252 --> 21:38.949
We were pretty much inseparable.

21:38.949 --> 21:41.256
Mm-hmm.
It drove my father crazy.

21:41.256 --> 21:43.171
He used to call us
the Wonder Twins.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.781
The Wonder Twins, yeah.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.832
I--I can't do this.

21:51.832 --> 21:55.314
It's not your fault,
but please,

21:55.314 --> 21:57.794
don't come back.

22:05.846 --> 22:07.326
Mr. Irons,

22:07.326 --> 22:08.979
my boss would like a word.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.503
Who's your boss?

22:10.503 --> 22:12.069
I think you know.

22:22.036 --> 22:25.169
So after your truck
was stolen,

22:25.169 --> 22:27.520
you decided to risk your lives

22:27.520 --> 22:30.523
and Natalie's to get it back?

22:30.523 --> 22:31.741
You had just gotten
your diagnosis.

22:31.741 --> 22:33.395
We didn't wanna bother you.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.832
And I--I mean,
we did get the truck back.

22:35.832 --> 22:36.964
At what cost?

22:36.964 --> 22:39.662
Those guys could have
really hurt you.

22:44.275 --> 22:48.628
Jonathan, who did this to you?

22:49.542 --> 22:51.544
I was with Grandpa.

22:51.544 --> 22:53.023
Jonathan?

22:55.156 --> 22:56.636
It was Candice's dad.

22:58.115 --> 23:00.335
Emmitt Pergande did this?

23:05.688 --> 23:07.647
Mom. Mom, please.

23:07.647 --> 23:09.475
Stay in the car.

23:11.302 --> 23:13.261
This is not a good idea.

23:17.221 --> 23:18.745
Did you hit my son?

23:21.661 --> 23:23.837
Don't look at him.
Look at me.

23:23.837 --> 23:26.796
Listen, whatever story
he may have told you--

23:26.796 --> 23:29.059
Don't you dare
call my son a liar,

23:29.059 --> 23:30.321
you miserable coward.

23:32.062 --> 23:33.455
Watch your tone.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.283
The only reason I am not
calling the sheriff

23:35.283 --> 23:37.981
is because of your daughter.

23:37.981 --> 23:41.507
Don't think I won't
lay hands on a woman.

23:42.769 --> 23:44.423
Men like you don't scare me.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.774
Maybe I need to teach
all three of you a lesson.

23:48.818 --> 23:50.951
Mom, we should go.

23:50.951 --> 23:53.475
- Boys!
- Mom, I got this.

23:53.475 --> 23:54.607
No, you don't.

23:54.607 --> 23:55.999
Get back in the car,
both of you.

23:55.999 --> 23:58.088
That's right.

23:58.088 --> 23:59.699
Best be getting back.

24:03.616 --> 24:06.270
You stay away from my family.

24:11.493 --> 24:13.582
Get in the car.

24:21.285 --> 24:22.765
You two head upstairs.

24:22.765 --> 24:24.985
We'll talk about this more
when your dad gets home.

24:28.815 --> 24:31.513
- Mom?
- You OK?

24:31.513 --> 24:33.776
Mom?

24:33.776 --> 24:36.213
I'm--

24:40.261 --> 24:42.132
I'm fine.

24:44.004 --> 24:47.486
We truly thought
we had this under control

24:47.486 --> 24:50.358
because all the vials
are accounted for.

24:50.358 --> 24:53.274
And yet somehow his blood
ended up in the hands

24:53.274 --> 24:55.842
of one of the most dangerous
criminals in Metropolis.

24:55.842 --> 24:58.018
No one could have predicted
someone was capable

24:58.018 --> 25:00.237
of synthesizing it
from a single drop.

25:00.237 --> 25:02.849
You never should have kept
my blood in the first place,

25:02.849 --> 25:04.285
especially without telling me.

25:04.285 --> 25:05.939
After you recovered
from your incident

25:05.939 --> 25:08.202
with Ms. Allston,
we wanted to be prepared

25:08.202 --> 25:12.293
in case we ever found ourselves
in a similar situation.

25:12.293 --> 25:15.383
Have you used it
for anything else since then?

25:15.383 --> 25:16.602
Nothing.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.995
Hand to God.

25:18.995 --> 25:21.215
Well, clearly
all these bells and whistles

25:21.215 --> 25:22.695
aren't doing a damn thing.

25:22.695 --> 25:24.697
We need to make sure
this never happens again.

25:24.697 --> 25:25.959
I agree.

25:32.661 --> 25:34.141
Thank you for your time, General.

25:42.192 --> 25:44.586
John Henry Irons.

25:44.586 --> 25:49.417
It's one thing to hear that
you're alive on this planet,

25:49.417 --> 25:52.768
but to see another version
of you here, in the flesh--

25:52.768 --> 25:55.423
What do you want?

25:55.423 --> 25:58.731
To know if you're the type
of man I think you are.

26:10.699 --> 26:14.573
For years, Lois Lane
has been coming after me,

26:14.573 --> 26:16.575
convinced that I
took over Intergang

26:16.575 --> 26:21.101
after its leader, Boss Moxie,
was killed by Lex Luthor.

26:21.101 --> 26:23.190
No matter how much good
I've done,

26:23.190 --> 26:26.193
no matter how much
I've transformed my community,

26:26.193 --> 26:30.197
she continues to dig
like a dog with a bone.

26:30.197 --> 26:31.764
So she's at it again,

26:31.764 --> 26:35.855
even sending Superman
to my home.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.770
What's that got
to do with me?

26:45.125 --> 26:46.169
You tell me.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.137
All right, look.

26:57.137 --> 27:00.662
We all knew this
was gonna be awkward, OK?

27:00.662 --> 27:02.359
But the longer
we wait to talk about it,

27:02.359 --> 27:06.799
the harder it's gonna be
to move past it, all right?

27:10.846 --> 27:13.327
Sarah...

27:13.327 --> 27:17.070
I am so sorry
about what happened.

27:17.070 --> 27:19.202
I wish I could take it back.

27:19.202 --> 27:20.682
I know that I can't.

27:20.682 --> 27:24.643
All I can ask for is a chance
to make things right.

27:26.383 --> 27:30.039
- How?
- By promising you right now

27:30.039 --> 27:34.740
that what happened
will never, ever happen again.

27:34.740 --> 27:38.221
I never wanna hurt you,
honey, never.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.660
I'm so disappointed in myself.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.848
Mom, about what I said...

27:57.458 --> 27:58.851
I didn't mean it.

27:58.851 --> 28:00.896
I know.

28:00.896 --> 28:05.422
I don't know why I said it,
and it was really hurtful.

28:05.422 --> 28:07.424
And...

28:07.424 --> 28:09.426
I know it wasn't true.

28:16.042 --> 28:18.697
I just want things
to be better.

28:23.527 --> 28:25.094
Look, mijita.

28:25.094 --> 28:27.706
This is a first step.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.316
So maybe just--

28:29.316 --> 28:31.753
just be willing
to give it a try.

28:43.852 --> 28:45.419
What's wrong?

28:45.419 --> 28:48.639
- Mom's not feeling good.
- I'm fine.

28:48.639 --> 28:51.294
I just overexerted
myself a little.

28:51.294 --> 28:54.733
Babe, told you
to take it easy.

28:55.690 --> 28:58.388
Wrong day for that.

28:58.388 --> 28:59.825
What happened?

29:00.956 --> 29:03.045
We went to talk
to Candice's dad.

29:05.134 --> 29:06.701
He's the one who hit you?

29:08.311 --> 29:09.399
And stole my truck.

29:11.532 --> 29:13.664
He threatened Mom with a gun.

29:13.664 --> 29:15.884
It's fine, Clark.
I handled it.

29:15.884 --> 29:17.190
No.

29:17.190 --> 29:19.235
This is not a job
for Superman.

29:19.235 --> 29:21.107
He's not going.

29:23.109 --> 29:25.981
I'd heard rumblings
last year

29:25.981 --> 29:28.941
about a man in a steel suit
flying around Metropolis,

29:28.941 --> 29:30.943
helping Superman.

29:30.943 --> 29:32.771
I didn't think much
of it at the time,

29:32.771 --> 29:35.121
but now it makes sense.

29:35.121 --> 29:39.995
The John Henry Irons I knew
always wanted to be a hero,

29:39.995 --> 29:42.606
make a difference in the world.

29:44.391 --> 29:47.829
He was one of the smartest men
I ever met.

29:49.526 --> 29:51.964
But he just wouldn't listen.

29:58.448 --> 30:00.581
How smart are you?

30:06.195 --> 30:07.457
You need to walk away, John.

30:07.457 --> 30:08.763
Where is Darlene?

30:08.763 --> 30:10.809
Walk away, and so does she.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.857
Don't make the same
mistake he did.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.002
Go to hell.

30:41.361 --> 30:42.710
I need you to scan Metropolis.

30:42.710 --> 30:43.842
Look for the same
plasma explosive

30:43.842 --> 30:45.452
I had in my ship
when I arrived.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.639
Clark.

30:58.639 --> 30:59.640
Are you OK?

30:59.640 --> 31:01.120
Nope.

31:08.562 --> 31:10.694
Emmitt Pergande?

31:10.694 --> 31:12.783
I'm Jon Kent's dad.

31:12.783 --> 31:14.394
Lois Lane's husband.

31:15.917 --> 31:18.615
We need to have a talk.

31:18.615 --> 31:21.009
Get the hell out of my face.

31:27.973 --> 31:31.150
You hit my son,

31:31.150 --> 31:34.283
pulled a gun on my wife.

31:34.283 --> 31:37.634
And now you and I are gonna
step outside so we can talk.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.813
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

31:50.343 --> 31:53.476
I'd really rather not do this
in front of your daughter.

31:55.435 --> 31:57.785
You think she hasn't
seen this before?

32:04.226 --> 32:07.012
Now, if you ever

32:07.012 --> 32:08.622
threaten my family again,

32:08.622 --> 32:10.493
take something
that isn't yours,

32:10.493 --> 32:14.367
or sell another
dangerous drug...

32:15.803 --> 32:17.544
I will come for you.

32:18.806 --> 32:20.112
OK.

32:23.463 --> 32:26.031
And my wife will expose
who you really are,

32:26.031 --> 32:29.295
and you will go away
for a very long time.

32:31.471 --> 32:32.428
Now leave.

32:40.610 --> 32:41.742
Damn, Kent.

32:43.483 --> 32:47.095
I'm sorry
to interrupt everyone's dinner.

32:51.447 --> 32:55.843
And, um, I'm really, really
sorry you had to see that.

32:55.843 --> 32:57.758
Did my dad really hurt Jon?

33:00.456 --> 33:01.980
Can I see him?

33:01.980 --> 33:04.156
Yeah, of course.

33:09.509 --> 33:12.425
<i>- I've located the explosive.</i>
- Where?

33:12.425 --> 33:14.688
<i>It's in the Bakerline
parking garage.</i>

33:14.688 --> 33:17.169
<i>And, John,
you only have 30 seconds</i>

33:17.169 --> 33:19.214
<i>before it detonates.</i>

33:24.785 --> 33:27.788
Help me!
Please help!

33:31.357 --> 33:33.533
John, please help me.
- I got you. I got you.

33:33.533 --> 33:34.969
- Please help me.
- Hold on. Hold on.

33:34.969 --> 33:36.753
Hold on, OK?
<i>- 20 seconds.</i>

33:36.753 --> 33:38.059
I've seen this before.

33:38.059 --> 33:39.756
I designed this.

33:39.756 --> 33:42.585
Hold on. Wait. Wait.

33:42.585 --> 33:43.978
Wait. Wait.

33:43.978 --> 33:45.719
<i>You've sped up
the detonation, John.</i>

33:45.719 --> 33:49.375
OK, I used biometrics
as a kill switch.

33:49.375 --> 33:51.638
Is it fingerprints?
Fingerprints.

33:51.638 --> 33:54.032
<i>5, 4, 3...</i>

33:54.032 --> 33:57.339
- Biometrics. Please.
<i>- 2, 1.</i>

34:07.306 --> 34:09.177
I'm sorry, Darlene.

34:09.177 --> 34:10.700
I'm so sorry.

34:26.064 --> 34:28.805
I should kill you right now.

34:28.805 --> 34:31.069
But you won't.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.896
You don't know me.

34:32.896 --> 34:34.420
I know your family, though,

34:34.420 --> 34:36.291
and not just
that sister of yours

34:36.291 --> 34:38.250
here in Metropolis

34:38.250 --> 34:41.731
but the whole family
down in New Orleans.

34:41.731 --> 34:45.605
Anything happens to me,
they all die.

34:45.605 --> 34:48.129
My people are just waiting
for the order.

34:55.049 --> 34:57.225
I guess I know you
better than you think,

34:57.225 --> 34:59.184
which is why you're
gonna fly out of here

34:59.184 --> 35:00.794
and never come back.

35:00.794 --> 35:04.450
Because if I see you
or your war suit again,

35:04.450 --> 35:07.844
you're gonna find out
exactly the kind of man I am.

35:07.844 --> 35:09.455
I know what you are.

35:09.455 --> 35:12.545
Then it shouldn't
be a problem.

35:12.545 --> 35:16.244
Consider it a favor
for an old friend.

35:26.863 --> 35:29.170
<i>I knew he wasn't
a great guy,</i>

35:29.170 --> 35:32.652
but I never thought that he
would do anything like this.

35:32.652 --> 35:35.089
I'm so sorry.

35:35.089 --> 35:36.830
No, this isn't your fault.

35:39.006 --> 35:40.355
Maybe it is, though.

35:40.355 --> 35:42.444
I mean, everything
my dad's done, right--

35:42.444 --> 35:44.838
the X-K, stealing your truck--
he was just--

35:44.838 --> 35:47.449
He was just trying
to take care of me.

35:47.449 --> 35:50.322
Those were his decisions,
not yours.

35:51.192 --> 35:52.846
It's just, he's--

35:52.846 --> 35:54.021
he's all I've got.

35:54.021 --> 35:56.197
You have us.

35:56.197 --> 35:58.765
And until you figure everything
out, you can stay here.

35:58.765 --> 36:00.680
Seriously? For real?

36:00.680 --> 36:03.291
I--I can't.
I mean, you have cancer.

36:03.291 --> 36:04.858
Yeah, but it doesn't
get to decide this.

36:04.858 --> 36:06.294
I do.

36:06.294 --> 36:08.470
And Clark.

36:08.470 --> 36:09.732
You can stay
in Jonathan's room,

36:09.732 --> 36:11.299
and he'll stay
with his brother.

36:13.388 --> 36:15.999
Boys, why don't you guys go
with Candice to get her things?

36:15.999 --> 36:17.653
Hmm?

36:19.307 --> 36:21.396
Thank you, Ms. Lane.

36:34.366 --> 36:35.845
Where's Candice's dad now?

36:37.543 --> 36:40.154
Sounds like his car just
crossed into Shawnee County.

36:40.154 --> 36:41.808
That was fast.

36:41.808 --> 36:43.505
You must have
really scared him.

36:44.767 --> 36:46.900
You sure about this,
her staying here?

36:46.900 --> 36:49.598
It's just until she finds
something permanent.

36:51.426 --> 36:53.646
This is gonna be
a horrible disaster,

36:53.646 --> 36:55.822
isn't it?
- Yeah, probably, yeah.

36:57.432 --> 36:58.999
I love you.

36:58.999 --> 37:00.914
I love you too.

37:17.626 --> 37:19.324
More eggs, please.

37:20.803 --> 37:23.937
Well, looks like
your appetite's back.

37:26.374 --> 37:28.550
Hey, there's, uh, breakfast
if you want any.

37:28.550 --> 37:30.857
- You can have my seat.
- Uh, I'm OK. Thanks.

37:30.857 --> 37:32.989
No, uh, I'm gonna
drop her off at work.

37:32.989 --> 37:35.644
Oh, uh, I can bring you back
some of that tea if you want.

37:35.644 --> 37:37.646
That would be lovely.
Thank you.

37:37.646 --> 37:39.909
- - All right.
- See ya.

37:43.696 --> 37:45.306
Tea?

37:45.306 --> 37:48.091
Yeah, seems like everyone's
on their best behavior today.

37:48.091 --> 37:51.312
That was very nice of you
to offer your seat to Candice,

37:51.312 --> 37:52.792
especially compared
to how you treated

37:52.792 --> 37:55.577
your grandfather
the other day.

37:55.577 --> 37:56.883
He told you about that?

37:56.883 --> 37:58.406
Yeah, he did.

37:58.406 --> 38:00.321
And it's not OK for you
to talk to an adult like that.

38:00.321 --> 38:01.975
You understand?
- Yes, sir.

38:01.975 --> 38:04.934
So you are going
to apologize to him,

38:04.934 --> 38:07.546
and then the two of you are
going back to that barbershop.

38:07.546 --> 38:09.243
Look, your granddad's right.

38:09.243 --> 38:11.637
If you wanna keep being a hero,
you've got to be careful,

38:11.637 --> 38:13.595
even if that means doing
something you don't wanna do.

38:16.685 --> 38:17.773
OK.

38:24.389 --> 38:26.347
I'm sorry.

38:26.347 --> 38:28.001
I shouldn't have spoken
to you like that.

38:29.045 --> 38:30.830
Gonna be honest
with you, son.

38:30.830 --> 38:33.833
What you said
really hurt my feelings.

38:33.833 --> 38:37.880
There was a time when I would
not have admitted that, but...

38:37.880 --> 38:39.360
it's true.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.014
Well, you didn't deserve it.

38:41.014 --> 38:43.495
I feel bad; you were just
trying to help me.

38:43.495 --> 38:45.671
I appreciate you saying that.

38:46.498 --> 38:47.542
We good?

38:47.542 --> 38:50.240
Yeah.

38:50.240 --> 38:51.677
Yeah, we're good.

38:52.678 --> 38:53.853
All right.

38:53.853 --> 38:55.115
Guess I got
to get this over with.

38:55.115 --> 38:56.769
Hold on a second.

38:58.031 --> 38:59.859
After you ran off,
I got to thinking

38:59.859 --> 39:02.470
about what it's like
to be your age.

39:02.470 --> 39:05.647
How everything seemed
so damn important,

39:05.647 --> 39:07.606
especially how you look.

39:07.606 --> 39:09.651
And even though
I believe you'd benefit

39:09.651 --> 39:11.087
from a nice trim...

39:13.176 --> 39:14.874
maybe there's another option.

39:14.874 --> 39:16.702
Like what?

39:18.791 --> 39:22.621
Had my team
put together something

39:22.621 --> 39:26.364
that should keep
that hair of yours in check.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.930
This is awesome!

39:27.930 --> 39:30.846
That's, uh,
not even the best part.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.068
Uh...

39:35.068 --> 39:37.244
these belonged to my dad.

39:37.244 --> 39:38.854
He flew a P-38 Lightning

39:38.854 --> 39:41.248
over Berlin
in the Second World War.

39:41.248 --> 39:44.382
Even earned a Flying Cross.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.166
I want you to have them.

39:46.166 --> 39:47.820
Grandpa.

39:47.820 --> 39:50.257
Plus, I think they'll
tie together the whole outfit.

39:50.257 --> 39:54.566
Can't have my grandson
not looking sharp out there.

39:54.566 --> 39:56.481
Thank you.

39:56.481 --> 39:58.265
I'll take care of them,
I promise.

39:58.265 --> 39:59.919
I know you will.

40:02.835 --> 40:05.098
Well, now that we got that
over with,

40:05.098 --> 40:08.144
how about you and me go fishing
for real this time?

40:08.144 --> 40:09.189
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

40:09.189 --> 40:10.930
Yeah, let's do it.

40:10.930 --> 40:13.106
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

40:13.106 --> 40:15.413
Your sister would never
have been a target

40:15.413 --> 40:17.023
if I had just listened to you.

40:17.023 --> 40:20.287
Bruno found me because
of what happened with Lana,

40:20.287 --> 40:21.767
not because you talked
to Darlene.

40:21.767 --> 40:24.770
It's still not an excuse
for keeping it from you.

40:26.772 --> 40:28.817
Maybe I should have
another talk with Bruno.

40:28.817 --> 40:30.297
Not before I set up
security measures

40:30.297 --> 40:32.038
that keeps Darlene
and the rest of my family safe.

40:32.038 --> 40:34.127
- How much time do you need?
- Couple weeks.

40:34.127 --> 40:36.434
Then we'll figure out
a way to go after Mannheim.

40:37.739 --> 40:40.438
Actually,
I already have one.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.787
His hospital.

40:41.787 --> 40:43.136
If I sign up
as a chemo patient there,

40:43.136 --> 40:44.964
I would be right
in the middle of Hob's Bay.

40:44.964 --> 40:47.401
Looking firsthand into
what he did to Henry Miller.

40:47.401 --> 40:50.578
And getting treatments from
a place controlled by Mannheim.

40:50.578 --> 40:52.493
That he has
spent millions promoting

40:52.493 --> 40:54.103
as the best facility
in the country.

40:54.103 --> 40:56.062
He's not gonna let anything bad
happen to me there.

40:56.062 --> 40:57.150
It's too public.

41:01.154 --> 41:05.767
Clark, I promise, getting
healthy is still the priority.

41:05.767 --> 41:07.073
OK.

41:07.073 --> 41:08.640
But I'm going with you.
- All right.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.076
I'll do the paperwork
when we get home.

41:10.076 --> 41:12.513
It'll be in their system
at the end of the day.

41:17.431 --> 41:19.477
You think she's really
just coming

41:19.477 --> 41:21.783
to Hob's Bay for treatment?

41:21.783 --> 41:23.002
No.

41:24.569 --> 41:26.222
If you want her taken out--

41:26.222 --> 41:28.660
Then I'll make
those arrangements.

41:31.489 --> 41:36.276
For now, we need
to know what she wants.

41:36.276 --> 41:39.801
Got someone in mind
to help out with that?

41:39.801 --> 41:41.150
I do.

41:45.154 --> 41:47.679
Me.

42:14.314 --> 42:16.621
Greg, move your head.
