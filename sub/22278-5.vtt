00:06.867 --> 00:09.300
NARRATOR: On this episode
of Life Below Zero...

00:09.333 --> 00:12.400
Unwanted predators
have Sue on high alert.

00:12.433 --> 00:13.467
Boom!

00:13.500 --> 00:15.133
NARRATOR: Andy and Kate
welcome a newcomer

00:15.167 --> 00:17.867
with dreams
of living in the bush.

00:17.900 --> 00:21.167
I think I might have
some rough days ahead of me.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.600
NARRATOR: Erik prepares for
the spoils of hunting season.

00:24.633 --> 00:28.567
ERIC: I'm gonna head out
through the woods
and find a suitable meat pole.

00:28.600 --> 00:32.500
NARRATOR:
And in Noorvik, a wrong step
puts Agnes on the edge.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.100
AGNES: Jon, get off that!
Get in the fucking boat.

00:55.833 --> 00:57.167
ANDY: That a boy, Iceberg.

01:01.933 --> 01:03.033
Go, Teak.

01:04.367 --> 01:07.500
ANDY: There. Good job.
You stay right there.

01:07.533 --> 01:09.533
When I came here to Eagle

01:09.567 --> 01:12.433
there was a whole network
of young people
in their 20s and 30s

01:12.467 --> 01:15.267
living out here,
and they're all gone.

01:15.300 --> 01:18.067
We're a dying breed,
we're an endangered species,

01:18.100 --> 01:20.167
and we need young people
to come out.

01:20.200 --> 01:23.600
People are losing the ability
to develop these skills
and live this way,

01:23.633 --> 01:27.267
and this is a fundamental way
of human existence.

01:27.300 --> 01:30.267
NARRATOR: Andy and Kate
are determined
to teach the next generation

01:30.300 --> 01:32.033
how to survive in the bush,

01:32.067 --> 01:35.400
but learning these skills
doesn't come easy.

01:35.433 --> 01:38.800
Nice clear day.
Beautiful day to fly.

01:38.833 --> 01:42.833
ANDY: We run a camp
where we teach people
bush skills,

01:42.867 --> 01:44.833
and we have a client
coming in today

01:44.867 --> 01:47.800
who's here to learn
about subsistence living.

02:02.133 --> 02:04.667
-Hey, buddy!
-KATE: Well, hello, Cody.

02:04.700 --> 02:07.433
CODY: My name's Cody Allen,
and I'm from
Beaverton, Oregon.

02:07.467 --> 02:11.300
When I was, uh, living in
Oregon I spent a lot of time
doing construction sites,

02:11.333 --> 02:13.700
and, uh,
working in restaurants,

02:13.733 --> 02:16.000
and dealing with people
and bosses all the time,

02:16.033 --> 02:17.467
and it was not fun at all.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.933
Oh! Gimme a hug.

02:19.967 --> 02:22.633
I give handshakes.
Hugs come later maybe.

02:22.667 --> 02:25.000
-Yeah. You don't look like
the hugging type sometimes.
-(CHUCKLES)

02:25.033 --> 02:27.133
CODY: Coming out into a place
like this,

02:27.167 --> 02:29.033
it's, uh, extremely dangerous.

02:29.067 --> 02:32.233
And if I would've
came up here without
Andy and Kate's assistance

02:32.267 --> 02:35.033
I'd die probably within a day,
two maybe.

02:35.067 --> 02:37.433
I mean,
you're gonna run out of food,
and I don't know how to hunt.

02:37.467 --> 02:38.600
I don't know how to trap.

02:38.633 --> 02:40.600
I've never really
shot an animal.

02:40.633 --> 02:42.700
KATE: The one thing
you gotta always remember

02:42.733 --> 02:45.967
is be careful where you put
your feet, and your hands,
and your body.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.400
Because there's no
emergency room.

02:48.433 --> 02:52.067
So, safety first always,
and think about
what you're doing.

02:52.100 --> 02:53.933
Lot to learn. Lot to do.

02:53.967 --> 02:55.433
So let's go do it.

03:01.300 --> 03:02.800
(HUSKIES YELPING)

03:05.100 --> 03:07.500
CODY: I've always wanted
to come out here and do this,

03:07.533 --> 03:08.733
exactly what I'm doing now.

03:10.233 --> 03:12.800
And it's always been
this impossible mission

03:12.833 --> 03:14.967
because you have to have
so much knowledge.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.867
ANDY: Just keep your arms
inside the sled.

03:16.900 --> 03:18.767
CODY: You have to have
so many skills,

03:18.800 --> 03:20.900
and if you try
and come out here
on your own...

03:20.933 --> 03:23.500
There's people who've done it,
and they're dead.

03:25.433 --> 03:26.933
(HUSKIES BARKING)

03:31.833 --> 03:33.733
ANDY: Gee, gee! Whoa!

03:33.767 --> 03:35.067
KATE: I won!

03:35.533 --> 03:36.533
(LAUGHS)

03:40.267 --> 03:43.100
CODY: I just got here,
and I find myself

03:43.133 --> 03:44.967
just staring off
into the wilderness,

03:45.000 --> 03:47.333
and realise
I'm in serious country
out here.

03:50.333 --> 03:54.867
SUE: To recognise
the possibility of
something bad happening

03:54.900 --> 03:58.033
is to be prepared for it.

03:58.067 --> 03:59.433
But if you're never
prepared for it

03:59.467 --> 04:02.067
and it happened,
six feet under. Bye.

04:02.100 --> 04:03.367
That's not me.

04:09.900 --> 04:16.367
Kavik can be a very, um,
dangerous place to be.

04:16.400 --> 04:20.333
NARRATOR: This winter,
Sue moved from a cramped space
in Kavik's dining hall

04:20.367 --> 04:22.467
to a new building.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.767
SUE: My feeling of security
is always tenuous,

04:25.800 --> 04:30.867
but those who are prepared
tend to have less damage.

04:30.900 --> 04:34.033
When I was in the dining hall,
it was very cut and dry.

04:34.967 --> 04:37.033
When I'm in bed
and laying here,

04:37.067 --> 04:39.867
first thing my hand does
is grab the pistol.

04:39.900 --> 04:43.233
The next the thing
the other hand does
is grab the gun.

04:44.767 --> 04:47.133
But this is
an all-new building
for me this winter.

04:47.167 --> 04:49.500
So, one of the things
I have to do

04:49.533 --> 04:52.833
is choose which weapons
that I'm gonna have
in this building.

04:52.867 --> 04:56.633
So if I'm lying in bed,
this gun is always here.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.633
This gun
is the next one I grab.

04:58.667 --> 05:01.633
I don't know
when something's gonna come
crawling around.

05:01.667 --> 05:05.100
I have a history, um,
was attacked by a grizzly
some years back,

05:05.133 --> 05:09.933
and, uh, while it played
tonsil hockey with me
a little bit, um,

05:09.967 --> 05:11.833
I did come out okay.

05:11.867 --> 05:16.967
NARRATOR: By moving,
Sue's gained more space,
but it comes at a price.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.200
Living at the edge of camp
puts her bed
on the first line of attack

05:20.233 --> 05:21.933
for incoming predators.

05:24.667 --> 05:26.933
SUE: The predators
tend to be nocturnal.

05:26.967 --> 05:28.967
So it's very important

05:29.000 --> 05:32.267
that I have point
and click weapons
close to the bed.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.533
I need to be able to reach it,
point it, shoot it,

05:34.567 --> 05:36.367
not worry
about some stupid scope.

05:38.833 --> 05:42.167
So, this is my pistol.
It's a .44.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.600
It's gonna leave
a pretty good hole.

05:43.633 --> 05:46.933
This one I wear
when I'm outside doing things,

05:46.967 --> 05:50.233
but when I go to bed at night
that's where it lives.

05:50.267 --> 05:53.267
This is simple.
This is actually
my grandson's little gun.

05:53.300 --> 05:54.900
This is a .410 for birds.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.200
This, .30-06, if you lift it

06:00.233 --> 06:02.633
and the caribou
is only 10 feet away,

06:02.667 --> 06:06.133
through your scope
you're just gonna see
a patch of fur.

06:06.167 --> 06:07.400
When you see a scope
on a weapon,

06:07.433 --> 06:09.333
it's meant
for a longer distance.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.433
This is something that
there is no scope on it.

06:13.467 --> 06:14.867
It's called open sights.

06:16.400 --> 06:19.067
You pull it,
and I'm just looking
right down the barrel.

06:19.100 --> 06:20.400
You sight it in.

06:20.433 --> 06:21.433
Boom.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.433
This is a .45-70.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.933
It's gonna leave
a pretty massive hole
on the other side.

06:29.967 --> 06:32.700
But the biggest predator
is my bear population.

06:32.733 --> 06:38.467
So for several years
I have done what I call,
"Passive Bear Safety."

06:38.500 --> 06:41.500
Meaning, if they cross my path
I will deal with it.

06:41.533 --> 06:43.433
But, I now own the camp.

06:43.467 --> 06:46.800
I need to have
a little bit more aggressive
bear safety.

06:46.833 --> 06:51.667
So this is a AR-10.
20 round clip.

06:51.700 --> 06:54.400
So if I pull the trigger
as fast as I pull it,

06:54.433 --> 06:55.933
20 of his little friends
are gonna make sure

06:55.967 --> 06:57.833
that whatever I'm shooting at
goes down.

06:59.300 --> 07:03.133
This is strictly
for those situations

07:03.167 --> 07:06.133
where the final outcome
is one of us is gonna die.

07:11.067 --> 07:12.833
I would rather it not be me.

07:12.867 --> 07:14.767
I have 20 friends that agree.

07:15.967 --> 07:19.700
So, yeah.
I've got the .30-06, AR-10,

07:19.733 --> 07:23.567
.45-70, the .44 pistol,

07:23.600 --> 07:27.700
and last but not least,
Louisville Slugger.

07:29.133 --> 07:30.233
Boom.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.733
ERIK: When I lay on
my deathbed, the moments
that I'll reflect on

07:36.767 --> 07:41.500
are sitting up on a ridge,
watching the midnight sun
come down below a mountain,

07:41.533 --> 07:44.733
and come back up
with 100 pounds
of sheep meat on my back.

08:06.100 --> 08:07.367
Just fuelling up
my snow machine.

08:07.400 --> 08:11.533
I'm gonna head out
and find a suitable pole
to use as a meat pole.

08:11.567 --> 08:14.933
A meat pole is a piece of wood
that you hang up
in between two trees

08:14.967 --> 08:18.000
that you're able to
hang meat on and keep them up
off the ground,

08:18.033 --> 08:22.133
so nothing can chew on them
and they get plenty
of air flow around them.

08:22.167 --> 08:25.200
In the fall time,
there's a lot of meat
coming into the camp

08:25.233 --> 08:27.800
and I need a lot of space
to hang meat.

08:34.333 --> 08:39.433
There's a lot of independence
and freedom associated
with living out in the bush.

08:39.467 --> 08:42.967
But at the same time,
you need to kick your own butt
up out of bed in the morning.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.833
I don't have a boss,
and it's all just
being self-motivated

08:45.867 --> 08:48.133
and getting done
whatever needs to get done.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.000
(CHAINSAW STARTS)

08:58.300 --> 09:00.667
This tree here
will, uh, work well
as a meat pole.

09:04.167 --> 09:06.867
Pretty simple tools.
Just chainsaw
and snow machine.

09:06.900 --> 09:09.800
But hard part is throwing big,
heavy pieces of wood around.

09:17.367 --> 09:20.200
I'm gonna use this pole both
for hanging moose in the fall

09:20.233 --> 09:22.467
and hanging caribou meat
any time of year.

09:26.367 --> 09:29.200
AGNES: We like to be outdoors
the majority of the time,

09:30.800 --> 09:34.667
and every week
there's always something
different to go after.

09:43.533 --> 09:44.867
Weather looks awesome, ah?

09:45.733 --> 09:47.533
Clear and cold?

09:47.567 --> 09:49.067
NARRATOR: Seal meat and oil
are central

09:49.100 --> 09:51.733
for the Hailstones during
the long winters in Noorvik,

09:51.767 --> 09:54.467
but unusually
warm temperatures
are forcing them to fly

09:54.500 --> 09:56.300
to the neighbouring village
of Kotzebue

09:56.333 --> 09:58.000
just for an opportunity
to hunt.

09:59.767 --> 10:00.933
CHIP:
The river is just frozen,

10:00.967 --> 10:02.767
and it's not thick enough
to walk on,

10:02.800 --> 10:06.133
and it's driving the seals
out of the river
because they can't breathe

10:06.167 --> 10:07.667
unless they bust
up through the ice.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.000
And the seals
are leaving the river
right now,

10:11.033 --> 10:13.800
and it's gonna concentrate
the seals down towards
the Kotzebue area.

10:13.833 --> 10:17.067
So it's actually
the prime time to go
get them is right now.

10:18.733 --> 10:20.500
Good luck. I wish I could go.

10:20.533 --> 10:22.533
I just can't
legally hunt seals.

10:22.567 --> 10:24.533
I'm not a native Alaskan
that resides on the coast.

10:26.033 --> 10:27.367
Hungry for a seal.

10:29.467 --> 10:33.267
Hopefully the harbour's
not totally frozen,
or if it is, not too thick.

10:41.867 --> 10:44.133
I can see nothing, but ice.

10:44.167 --> 10:47.667
Ice, ice, ice.
It froze overnight.

10:47.700 --> 10:49.000
I can't believe that.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.667
We'll go check it out
at least.

11:00.567 --> 11:02.633
I'm borrowing
my cousin's boat today,

11:02.667 --> 11:04.667
so he's gonna let me
use his boat,

11:04.700 --> 11:07.167
and I'm gonna be able
to go do a little hunting,

11:07.200 --> 11:08.433
and hopefully I'll get lucky,

11:08.467 --> 11:11.733
and I'll be able to work
and process my seal

11:11.767 --> 11:15.833
and exchange him, seal oil,
for the use of his boat.

11:19.867 --> 11:21.267
Pull us!

11:22.867 --> 11:24.067
Come on, Ting!

11:26.900 --> 11:28.767
Whoo!

11:28.800 --> 11:30.767
TING: Go ahead. You guys turn.
I'm gonna push you guys
that way.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.267
AGNES: We're not turning.
We're going that way.

11:33.300 --> 11:34.500
I'm serious Ting.

11:34.533 --> 11:36.633
When we're out there
in the water

11:36.667 --> 11:38.667
you have to have
all your senses.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.667
You have to fucking
pay attention.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.333
When I say something,
don't wait,

11:42.367 --> 11:44.933
or don't ask a question
or try to correct me,

11:44.967 --> 11:48.633
because it's gonna be
kind of scary out there.

11:51.633 --> 11:55.267
NARRATOR: Agnes is no stranger
to losing family members
to the ice.

11:57.433 --> 11:59.833
It's been 21 years
and three weeks

11:59.867 --> 12:01.833
since my mother fell
through the ice,

12:01.867 --> 12:03.667
and I've never been
the same since.

12:03.700 --> 12:05.900
I don't fuck around
when it comes to ice.

12:05.933 --> 12:07.267
Let's go like this.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.467
Jon, get off that!
Get in the fucking boat!

12:16.200 --> 12:18.567
Jon! Quit it!

12:18.600 --> 12:20.600
We're not gonna do this
if you're gonna act stupid.

12:20.633 --> 12:23.800
When you pull
and put your whole boat
on your weight,

12:23.833 --> 12:25.367
you're just gonna go "doing!"

12:26.700 --> 12:29.767
No doing anything
outside the boat.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.800
-It's deep enough there.
-It's deep enough. Let's go.

12:32.833 --> 12:35.167
There's a lot of things
that can happen up here.

12:35.200 --> 12:38.700
The best way to do is
have common sense
and always play it safe.

12:39.767 --> 12:41.067
(ENGINE STARTING)

12:45.767 --> 12:49.600
Once we get going,
son, it'll go.
It'll bust through real easy.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.867
Especially the farther
out we go.

12:57.367 --> 12:59.000
I'm rocking back and forth.

12:59.033 --> 13:00.700
That gives the boat
a better chance

13:00.733 --> 13:03.333
to keep going over the ice
and it won't just stop.

13:03.367 --> 13:06.233
Then it'll also let the ice
break up a little,

13:06.267 --> 13:08.533
just so when we get back here

13:08.567 --> 13:11.133
we'll still have a path
if we need to turn back.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.833
And we might have
just about an hour, maybe two,

13:16.867 --> 13:20.267
to actually do
the seal hunting,
and then come right back.

13:24.567 --> 13:26.800
I see open water.
We're almost there, mom.

13:32.567 --> 13:34.500
AGNES: Okay. You can mostly
watch that side, bun.

13:34.533 --> 13:36.367
I'll try to keep my eyes
on this side.

13:45.767 --> 13:46.833
Oh, look!

13:47.967 --> 13:49.267
Jon, 3:00!

13:55.000 --> 13:57.700
(CHUCKLES) Check it out!
Look in front of us! Forwards!

14:00.300 --> 14:02.800
TING: Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

14:02.833 --> 14:04.800
JON: Harpoon, Ting!
AGNES: I got it, Jon!

14:04.833 --> 14:07.233
Look straight, 12:00, Jon.

14:07.267 --> 14:08.600
-(COCKS RIFLE)
-12:00.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.000
TING: Where's the seal by?

14:14.033 --> 14:15.800
Where'd it go? Where'd it go?
Where'd it go?

14:15.833 --> 14:18.167
AGNES: It's gonna be anywhere
in front of us.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.767
It's gonna come up again.
It didn't stay up that long.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.067
TING: I know.
It came up and went down?

14:36.100 --> 14:37.233
Keep going then, mom?

14:37.267 --> 14:39.467
Well, there's more.
I'm just gonna keep ready.

14:39.500 --> 14:40.600
Oh!

14:43.700 --> 14:44.867
(GUNSHOT)

14:44.900 --> 14:47.367
Aw, man! Almost!

14:48.667 --> 14:50.033
What the heck?

14:55.933 --> 14:58.467
It's getting too dark.
We're gonna have to
head back soon.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.233
AGNES: I think you're right.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.000
We did
a lot of, uh, work today.

15:07.033 --> 15:08.833
We did a lot of busting
through the ice

15:08.867 --> 15:11.633
and, uh, we saw
quite a few seals out there.

15:11.667 --> 15:15.133
So looking good for tomorrow.
We know the seals are here.

15:15.167 --> 15:18.433
It might be an easier hunt
if the ice
is a little thicker too,

15:18.467 --> 15:20.900
with the seals being able
to get on top of the ice.

15:26.433 --> 15:28.900
ANDY: That's the thing
that I've noticed about
the computer age.

15:28.933 --> 15:30.667
It's creating
a large group of people

15:30.700 --> 15:33.567
that don't have
a very long attention span.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.700
And to really learn a skill
you have to
dedicate time to it.

15:48.700 --> 15:51.033
KATE: When your feet get cold
your whole body's cold.

15:51.067 --> 15:53.333
-Yeah.
-So I'm glad you changed
your clothes and...

15:53.367 --> 15:55.633
-I don't think my boots...
-Now you can get to work here.

15:55.667 --> 15:58.567
NARRATOR: Carving out
a life for oneself
in the Alaskan bush

15:58.600 --> 16:00.467
is tough at best.

16:00.500 --> 16:05.067
Cody will have to master
the most basic skills
if he's going to survive.

16:05.100 --> 16:07.367
-All right guys, have fun.
-CODY: Thank you, Kate.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.533
All right babe,
go easy on the boy.

16:09.567 --> 16:11.000
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

16:11.833 --> 16:13.067
NARRATOR: Lesson one.

16:13.100 --> 16:16.067
Master the essential tools
for survival.

16:16.100 --> 16:19.600
ANDY: With these tools,
you pretty much have
everything you need

16:19.633 --> 16:21.333
to live out here.

16:21.367 --> 16:24.267
I moved to Alaska
when I was 22 years old,

16:24.300 --> 16:26.267
uh, from Washington DC area.

16:26.300 --> 16:28.333
I didn't know shit
when I came here.

16:28.367 --> 16:30.267
I had been doing construction.

16:30.300 --> 16:31.333
Had a great job.

16:31.367 --> 16:33.500
But, uh, something in my heart
told me

16:33.533 --> 16:36.100
I just had to come up
to Alaska and check it out.

16:36.133 --> 16:40.100
So basically what I had
was I had
a high-powered rifle.

16:40.133 --> 16:45.033
I had a .22 rifle,
for shooting squirrels,
rabbits, ducks, whatever.

16:45.067 --> 16:49.867
I had a small Hudson Bay Axe,
and it also doubles
as your hammer.

16:49.900 --> 16:52.133
One thing I'd really like you
to get in the habit of

16:52.167 --> 16:54.333
is find a place on your person

16:54.367 --> 16:57.700
where you can always have
matches and some birch bark.

16:57.733 --> 16:58.733
CODY: Okay.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.167
'Cause if you ever get wet,

17:01.200 --> 17:04.400
this is the one skill
you're gonna have to learn
to be very good at out here,

17:04.433 --> 17:06.033
and that's building a fire.

17:06.067 --> 17:09.333
A butane lighter
will not light
at thirty below zero.

17:09.367 --> 17:10.400
Okay.

17:10.433 --> 17:11.700
When I came out
into this country,

17:11.733 --> 17:14.667
everybody had their bowl that
went everywhere with them.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.433
-Okay.
-The advantages to wood

17:16.467 --> 17:20.233
is when it's really cold,
your food doesn't get cold
in them really quick.

17:20.267 --> 17:21.800
-But it's light, too.
-Yeah.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.367
You know? And they're durable.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.467
-They're pretty darn strong.
-What kind of wood is it?

17:25.500 --> 17:27.533
-This is birch.
-Birch. Mmm-hmm.

17:27.567 --> 17:29.667
CODY: I think I got
a plastic canteen
and a metal tin

17:29.700 --> 17:31.367
that goes around it
that I brought with me.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.467
And that works fine.
But you know what?

17:33.500 --> 17:36.233
At 20 below zero,
your lips stick to that metal.

17:36.267 --> 17:39.400
(CHUCKLES) Oh, shit.
I didn't even think
about that.

17:39.433 --> 17:42.200
CODY: I'm guessing
his brain has gotta be
like a super computer

17:42.233 --> 17:43.400
when it comes to
outdoor living.

17:43.433 --> 17:47.000
Because just right over
in that little 10 minute spiel

17:47.033 --> 17:48.567
about the tools
and everything,

17:48.600 --> 17:53.133
I learned more than
I would have in, I don't know,
10 years down in Oregon.

17:53.167 --> 17:56.767
As you spend more time here
you'll learn
what the dangers are.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.933
The sounds will become
more familiar.

17:58.967 --> 18:00.367
The alarm bells
will still be there,

18:00.400 --> 18:03.400
but you'll be able
to quickly say,
"Oh, that's just this."

18:04.367 --> 18:07.367
All right.
So let's get this stuff out,

18:07.400 --> 18:09.267
and this is gonna be
a little bit stiff.

18:09.300 --> 18:11.800
The main goal
is to learn fundamentals.

18:11.833 --> 18:15.667
Build that base of experience
as broad as we can build it.

18:15.700 --> 18:18.033
First day, shelter.

18:18.067 --> 18:20.367
Shelter and warmth, that's all
he's got to figure out.

18:20.400 --> 18:24.833
Enthusiasm, self-motivation,
if he's got that,
he'll do fine.

18:24.867 --> 18:27.500
All right.
So why don't you go ahead
and unfold that.

18:28.867 --> 18:30.200
CODY:
This place is freaking cold.

18:30.233 --> 18:31.800
Got off the plane here,

18:31.833 --> 18:34.467
and I think within 30 minutes
my face was already ice,

18:34.500 --> 18:38.833
and right then and there
I kind of realised
this is a whole new world.

18:38.867 --> 18:42.933
I mean, it's literally like
I just landed
on a different planet.

18:42.967 --> 18:45.433
I'm just still
anxious, nervous.

18:45.467 --> 18:47.233
Getting out here
and not knowing
how to do something

18:47.267 --> 18:49.700
it's like you want to
take it slow no matter what.

18:49.733 --> 18:53.367
ANDY: I'll hand the pipe in.
You can run that up through.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.333
If you're an arrogant person
living out here,

18:55.367 --> 18:56.933
and you think
you can do everything,

18:56.967 --> 18:59.567
it's gonna come back
and bite you every time

18:59.600 --> 19:01.233
and you'll get
yourself in real trouble.

19:01.267 --> 19:02.367
So you have to be humble.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.200
You have to realise
that you're gonna screw up,

19:05.233 --> 19:08.233
and, you know, learn from it.

19:08.267 --> 19:10.067
SUE: If you have one foot
in yesterday,
one foot in tomorrow,

19:10.100 --> 19:11.633
you're not living in today.

19:13.367 --> 19:18.967
But part of my footstep
has to be in tomorrow
so I can survive today.

19:24.633 --> 19:29.200
I've got inside of my dwelling
going for protection wise
and security.

19:29.233 --> 19:31.267
Now I need to secure
the exterior.

19:31.300 --> 19:35.200
NARRATOR: With nothing
but wilderness surrounding
her home for many miles,

19:35.233 --> 19:39.800
Sue has to keep away
the predators
by any means necessary.

19:39.833 --> 19:43.933
Bears, all your predators,
keen sense of smell.

19:43.967 --> 19:48.200
I use my leftover coffee
grounds get repurposed
and sprinkled out.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.000
Even though
there will be more snow,

19:53.033 --> 19:55.367
it is such a keen,
strong odour

19:55.400 --> 19:59.200
that it is arming
camp from the outside in.

19:59.233 --> 20:01.700
I've been doing this
for years, and years,
and years now.

20:01.733 --> 20:06.800
Over time, it is just,
sort of, like you taking

20:06.833 --> 20:09.300
your morning coffee, and eggs,
and bacon

20:09.333 --> 20:12.200
and going and sitting
in a really ripe outhouse.

20:12.233 --> 20:14.967
Are you gonna go,
"Mmm, this is the place
I wanna eat?"

20:21.933 --> 20:25.700
My concern is the bears,
they are around.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.733
They've got, you know,
well over 83 tagged

20:30.767 --> 20:33.500
that have the possibility
of walking
right through my camp.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.767
They're up.
They're looking for food.

20:35.800 --> 20:41.700
And I happen to be
the only SOB that is cooking
in a, in a huge radius.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.300
What was that?

20:49.900 --> 20:52.100
That's one of my foxies.

20:52.133 --> 20:54.067
I forgot what I was saying.

20:54.100 --> 20:56.367
Oh, yeah,
if you have an animal

20:56.400 --> 21:00.233
that is raging,
charging, fixated,

21:00.267 --> 21:01.733
no, it's not gonna stop them.

21:01.767 --> 21:03.900
But for the ones that are
ambling through going,

21:03.933 --> 21:05.900
"Hey doesn't that chick
live here?

21:05.933 --> 21:07.733
"She'd make a tasty snack."

21:07.767 --> 21:10.000
They get close and go, "Whoa!"

21:10.033 --> 21:12.600
It burns
the heck out of their noses
and it smells like a sewer.

21:12.633 --> 21:14.500
You know?
No. I don't want to go there.

21:15.933 --> 21:19.433
The next thing I do is bleach.

21:19.467 --> 21:24.267
So, with the bleach,
put my thumb over,
this is what I do.

21:25.067 --> 21:26.300
Everything.

21:35.133 --> 21:37.333
Gonna hit it
a little bit heavy here.

21:37.367 --> 21:40.600
Now you can see,
this building here,

21:40.633 --> 21:43.767
all these marks are
where I've had to repair it.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.033
Um, a bear came through here.

21:46.067 --> 21:48.467
That's a wolverine
on the corner.

21:48.500 --> 21:52.167
So, I just, uh,
try to deter it,

21:52.200 --> 21:54.300
try to keep that exposure
to a minimum.

21:55.367 --> 21:57.667
I'm basically ready for winter
to come knocking.

21:57.700 --> 22:00.700
If a few animals come knocking
at the same time,
I've got it covered.

22:00.733 --> 22:02.333
Two-legged or four-legged.

22:02.367 --> 22:04.233
This chick
ain't going down easy.

22:04.267 --> 22:05.633
I'm ready.

22:09.300 --> 22:11.667
ERIK: I really enjoy
running my guiding business.

22:11.700 --> 22:14.200
You get to
fly around in planes,
and take people hunting,

22:14.233 --> 22:15.867
and set up tents.

22:18.333 --> 22:19.533
It's a great thing to do
for a living.

22:19.567 --> 22:21.000
I couldn't be more fortunate.

22:32.267 --> 22:34.233
Skidded this green log
in earlier today,

22:34.267 --> 22:39.133
and I'm gonna fix it
between these two trees,
and make a meat pole.

22:39.167 --> 22:43.700
NARRATOR: Erik Salitan is in
the final phase of securing
a safe place for his meat,

22:43.733 --> 22:46.867
but to do it, he's got to work
in snowy conditions,

22:46.900 --> 22:48.600
12 feet off the ground.

22:50.733 --> 22:54.700
ERIK: A meat pole is a pole
that hangs between two trees
that you hang meat off of.

22:54.733 --> 22:56.833
Keeps little animals
and stuff from
chewing on the meat,

22:56.867 --> 23:00.067
and keeps nice airflow,
and meat hanging
nice and clean.

23:01.233 --> 23:02.833
Got my pole lifted up.

23:02.867 --> 23:05.767
Now I'm just gonna attach it
here to the tree,

23:05.800 --> 23:09.833
just with tension
and some simple knots
on this chain.

23:09.867 --> 23:12.000
I need this pole
to be able to withstand,

23:13.500 --> 23:15.433
at least 1,000 pounds of meat.

23:19.900 --> 23:21.567
That side should be good.

23:24.900 --> 23:27.033
Sure beats lifting it by hand.

23:31.733 --> 23:33.267
Looks pretty level.

23:33.300 --> 23:34.967
Test her out for strength.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.467
Seems pretty solid to me.

23:40.500 --> 23:41.900
I'm happy with it.

23:41.933 --> 23:44.200
Should be able to hang
quite a bit of meat up there.

23:44.233 --> 23:47.033
Didn't take long
to cut this pole and hang it.

23:47.067 --> 23:49.800
I should be able
to use this pole
for a few years.

23:49.833 --> 23:51.433
When it gets kinda brittle,
I'll take it down,

23:51.467 --> 23:54.167
cut it up for firewood,
and make a new one.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.233
Looks good.

23:58.667 --> 24:01.300
I got the meat,
I got some ropes up there
in the bucket.

24:01.333 --> 24:03.333
I'm gonna climb up there,
and tie it up,

24:03.367 --> 24:05.400
and see
how this new meat pole works.

24:08.833 --> 24:11.433
The lifestyle that I get
to live up here
as a hunting guide

24:11.467 --> 24:14.433
and a subsistence hunter
and trapper is pretty unique

24:14.467 --> 24:16.867
and, you know,
there's a lot of work
associated with it,

24:16.900 --> 24:19.067
but I think
there's more pros than cons.

24:19.100 --> 24:20.567
It's a really
beautiful place to live,

24:20.600 --> 24:24.167
and I really enjoy
what I do for a living,
and it's a great life.

24:24.200 --> 24:28.100
It's pretty wholesome
and, uh, it's what I choose.

24:29.533 --> 24:31.400
This is a moose shoulder.

24:31.433 --> 24:33.800
This is a rack of moose ribs.

24:33.833 --> 24:35.833
And this is also
a rack of moose ribs.

24:35.867 --> 24:37.367
Now that this meat is hung
on the pole,

24:37.400 --> 24:39.767
I can bring in
each piece individually,

24:39.800 --> 24:41.167
and thaw it out,
and butcher it,

24:41.200 --> 24:42.600
and, kind of,
spread the work out

24:42.633 --> 24:45.800
rather than having it
just be a whole ton of cutting
all at once.

24:45.833 --> 24:48.467
So, got a several
hundred pounds of meat
right here.

24:48.500 --> 24:49.667
I have a lot of meat already.

24:49.700 --> 24:51.433
I'm sitting pretty
for the winter.

24:51.467 --> 24:55.333
Should have plenty of meat
to make it through
till next hunting season.

24:55.367 --> 24:57.667
Life is good.
I'm living fat on the hog

24:57.700 --> 25:00.233
and plenty
to keep my belly full.

what you're doing...

When you want to go
do something
in extreme weather

25:11.233 --> 25:14.600
and extreme cold,
because sometimes it can
get pretty dangerous.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.333
Nice weather, all right.

25:27.367 --> 25:28.867

After yesterday's failed hunt,

25:32.233 --> 25:34.700

or go home to Noorvik
empty handed.

25:36.933 --> 25:39.000
-JON: All set?
-Let the hunt begin.

25:42.567 --> 25:45.067
I just hope we can get
a real good shot

25:45.100 --> 25:48.367
and score a seal or two.

25:48.400 --> 25:53.800
If I catch at least one seal,
that'll carry us all the way
until the frozen winter.

25:53.833 --> 25:57.900
And then, then we can have
another opportunity
to go hunting again.

26:03.967 --> 26:06.233
Just be ready
to follow my shot.

26:09.367 --> 26:10.667
9:00.

26:13.067 --> 26:14.833
-Did you get it?
-Nope. No blood.

AGNES: Harpoon, Ting!

26:57.100 --> 26:58.533
-It's right there!
-TING: Where?

26:58.567 --> 26:59.900
You got it, bun!

27:01.300 --> 27:02.733
You were supposed to let go.

27:02.767 --> 27:04.067
JON: Harpoon!
AGNES: Here, Jon!

27:08.467 --> 27:09.967
JON: I can't see.

27:10.567 --> 27:12.433
Ugh, I missed. I missed.

27:14.433 --> 27:15.867
AGNES: It's real deep.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.400
It should come right back up.

27:20.167 --> 27:22.000
Man, we ran over it.

27:22.033 --> 27:23.933
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

27:23.967 --> 27:25.767
There's blood.
It was a sure hit.

27:26.500 --> 27:27.900
JON: I think we have a sinker.

27:27.933 --> 27:30.000
Ting, you can't be scared
to throw a harpoon.

27:30.033 --> 27:32.433
You have to have
your mind set.

27:32.467 --> 27:34.800
AGNES: When Ting was doing
her first harpooning,

27:34.833 --> 27:36.567
instead of throwing it
and let it go,

27:36.600 --> 27:42.000
she threw it and held it,
and tried to just poke it
and pull it back in.

27:42.033 --> 27:44.300
But, uh, she's just...
She's just learning.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.900
Show her
how to position her hand.

27:47.933 --> 27:50.933
The first step
is your fingers.

27:50.967 --> 27:52.467
Make sure
your tip is straight.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.467
JON: Don't just try to go up
to it and do that.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.567
You have to lift it
as high as you could,

27:56.600 --> 27:59.167
arc it, and then just
right into it anywhere.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.133
Right through the middle,
dead centre, anywhere.

28:01.167 --> 28:04.300
She's still got quite a bit of
practising to do.

28:04.333 --> 28:06.067
Uh, she still has
to figure out

28:06.100 --> 28:09.300
how hard she should throw,
or how to hold her hand.

28:09.333 --> 28:11.833
Let it go even. Throw it.

28:11.867 --> 28:14.667
You see how when I throw it,
it came back up?
This'll float.

28:14.700 --> 28:18.567
Yup, and once
this one gets stuck,
it'll come off.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.033
And it'll, this one will
let it come back up.

28:21.067 --> 28:22.867

-Okay. You got it Ting?

28:34.100 --> 28:35.800
Where'd they all just go?

28:42.667 --> 28:44.567
All hunts aren't successful.

28:44.600 --> 28:47.533
Sometimes you have to take it
for what it is.

28:47.567 --> 28:49.100
If we don't get anything,

28:49.133 --> 28:51.900
hey, at least the kids
got a chance to come out here

28:51.933 --> 28:55.033
and get some experience,
and come back and try again.

ANDY: When you live alone
for a little while,

29:03.267 --> 29:04.900

There's only
a few basic things

and temperatures dip

29:33.533 --> 29:36.033
far below what Cody is used to
in Oregon,

29:36.067 --> 29:39.533
he scours the forest
for the timber that will
keep him warm tonight.

29:42.933 --> 29:44.633
CODY: It's mixed emotions.

29:44.667 --> 29:48.500
I'm nervous, scared,
and really excited
at the same time.

29:50.200 --> 29:53.467
Using that saw,
it's almost kind of more
refreshing than a chainsaw

29:53.500 --> 29:55.567
'cause you're not so worried
about cutting your leg off.

29:58.333 --> 30:00.133
I don't know
how much wood I'm gonna need,

30:00.167 --> 30:03.600
but I figure 12 foot sections
are kind of easy to carry
and manoeuvre through here.

30:03.633 --> 30:06.133
Although I think
after about 20 pieces of log

30:06.167 --> 30:08.400
I'm really gonna wish
I had a chainsaw.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.533
Little haw. Little haw.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.500
Ho, ho.

30:16.533 --> 30:18.667
-How goes it?
-Good boy.

30:19.633 --> 30:21.200
-Hey, Blitzen.
-Hi, buddy.

-Oh, yay.

30:23.733 --> 30:25.033
(CHUCKLES)

30:25.067 --> 30:28.567
Couple of birch,
pieces of birch here.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.067
You can just get them out
and throw them on your pile
for right now.

30:31.100 --> 30:32.333
CODY: All right.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.867
ANDY: Birch trees are probably
one of the best resources
out here

30:36.900 --> 30:38.567
for a lot of different things.

30:38.600 --> 30:44.167
Build sleds, axe handles,
and birch bark on the outside
is really flammable.

30:44.200 --> 30:46.300
Birch bark when it's wet
will burn.

30:46.333 --> 30:47.600
CODY: That's amazing.

30:51.467 --> 30:52.967
Oh, come on.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.600
There we go.

30:54.633 --> 30:56.367
ANDY: Keep holding it
straight vertical.

30:57.933 --> 30:59.500
-Hold that heat up.
-Oh.

30:59.533 --> 31:00.733
ANDY:
You gotta watch that wind.

31:00.767 --> 31:03.100
It's challenging
to build a fire
in the wind out here.

31:03.133 --> 31:04.800
It doesn't take much wind
to lose it.

31:04.833 --> 31:05.933
CODY: Yeah.

31:05.967 --> 31:08.900
Back in Oregon
starting a fire is no problem,

31:08.933 --> 31:11.400
but out here, you know,
might not have
a lighter on you,

31:11.433 --> 31:14.167
and how you gonna start
a fire when
everything's frozen?

31:16.267 --> 31:18.533
ANDY:
Cup your hand around it. Yup.

31:18.567 --> 31:21.400
All these things
are just really
subtle techniques.

31:21.433 --> 31:22.700
There you go. You got it.

31:22.733 --> 31:26.867
You got it going now, and then
keep that birch vertical.

31:26.900 --> 31:28.733
There you go,
and then just move it around.

31:30.767 --> 31:32.667
CODY: That's amazing. Ooh!
(CHUCKLES)

31:32.700 --> 31:36.567
He's gotta learn
not to be afraid of fire
when he strikes a match.

31:36.600 --> 31:39.200
It's pretty hard to burn skin
at 50 below zero.

31:41.867 --> 31:43.067
(ANDY LAUGHS)

31:44.367 --> 31:46.133
CODY: I can already tell
how frustrating it can be.

31:46.167 --> 31:49.333
ANDY: (LAUGHS) Working outside
in zero degrees,

31:49.367 --> 31:52.767
or below zero temperatures,
is never easy to begin with.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.600
You're doing this
in some of the tougher
conditions right?

31:55.633 --> 31:59.167
It's not nearly as hard
when you got a stove going
and you're inside a place.

31:59.200 --> 32:01.633
It's just outside,
but I just wanted you
to get a feel.

32:01.667 --> 32:03.933
There you go.
Grab another piece
of birch bark,

32:03.967 --> 32:06.267
put this pile of birch bark
on top of it now.

32:06.300 --> 32:08.667
It's a waterproof
kind of a bark

32:08.700 --> 32:10.833
and that's why they were able
to use it for canoes.

32:10.867 --> 32:13.533
Okay. Now what I want you
to do is grab some of that,

32:13.567 --> 32:14.800
I call that squaw wood.

32:14.833 --> 32:17.433
Grab a big handful of it
and break it in half,

32:17.467 --> 32:19.133
and then
break it in half again.

32:19.167 --> 32:21.500
Okay. Now lay that
whole pile right on this.

32:22.667 --> 32:24.133
Okay. Then just wait.

32:24.167 --> 32:27.767
What you're gonna see is,
this is gonna flair up
really big

32:27.800 --> 32:29.900
and then it's gonna go
to coals really quick.

32:29.933 --> 32:33.567
So you have to be ready
to then put the next size
piece of wood on it.

32:34.733 --> 32:37.067
And while you got it
going good like that...

32:37.100 --> 32:40.233
That's all right.
Just throw it on like that.
They'll catch.

32:40.267 --> 32:43.100
And it's always a progression.
You know, smaller to bigger.

32:43.133 --> 32:45.267
And the other thing
that helps is keep them
fairly close,

32:45.300 --> 32:48.067
so once they start
they create heat
in between each other.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.967
CODY: Okay.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.800
-Yeah.
-But that's the one skill

32:51.833 --> 32:54.300
that you really wanna know
well up here.

32:54.333 --> 32:57.133
When you come out
into this environment
with this kind of cold,

32:57.167 --> 32:59.633
if you do the wrong thing,
it can take your life.

32:59.667 --> 33:01.733
Why don't you go on inside,
get your stove going.

33:01.767 --> 33:03.600
-Use the same principle.
-Yeah.

33:03.633 --> 33:05.833
And then when you come back
just keep cutting wood,

33:05.867 --> 33:09.967
'cause tonight I'd say
you're probably gonna burn
at least half of this tonight.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.133
-Okay.
-The idea
is not to survive out here,

33:13.167 --> 33:15.400
the idea
is to thrive out here.

33:15.433 --> 33:18.267
You know, you can come
into this situation with all
the knowledge in the world,

33:18.300 --> 33:21.500
but it kinda seems like
you're gonna have stuff thrown
at you, you'd never expect.

33:21.533 --> 33:23.633
And I think that's
one of the reasons
I'm happy to come out

33:23.667 --> 33:25.633
and learn from Andy,
is 'cause he's probably

33:25.667 --> 33:27.733
been through just about
everything you can imagine.

33:27.767 --> 33:29.067
I'll see you in a bit.

33:29.100 --> 33:31.200
-Thank you much, Andy.
-Yup. You're doing great.

33:32.167 --> 33:33.767
I got a good teacher.

33:33.800 --> 33:36.033
ANDY: Sometimes I try
and instruct too much.

33:36.067 --> 33:39.267
If I try and tell him
everything to look out for,
he'll never retain it.

33:39.300 --> 33:41.100
So there's really no point.

33:41.133 --> 33:43.200
You know, make a mistake,
you learn from it.

33:43.233 --> 33:44.967
Just don't get hurt
making the mistake.

34:06.533 --> 34:09.400
Well, right here
is the first official fire

34:09.433 --> 34:12.933
out here in Eagle,
Calico Camp.

34:13.933 --> 34:18.100
This kinda feels, uh,
ceremonial I guess.

34:20.700 --> 34:24.067
I might have put myself
in over my head a little bit.

34:24.100 --> 34:26.333
I think I might have
some rough days ahead of me.

34:31.833 --> 34:35.267
SUE: Yeah, I hear some people
say, you know, "Life's just
knocking me down."

34:36.700 --> 34:39.400
No it's not.

If you don't learn
to come when I call,

you're gonna end up dead

And this is no place
for naughtiness.

won't be here if you behave,

you understand.

There's things
that are gonna hurt you
out here.

A big old black wolf
tried to come in,

35:41.367 --> 35:46.000
and whether mating
or eating her,
was his interest.

35:46.033 --> 35:48.067
Yeah, you were scared.
You went under the house.

35:48.100 --> 35:50.067
Guess what?
There is no under the house
this winter.

35:50.100 --> 35:51.600
It's gonna be covered
in snow, man.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.733
I want you for my friend.

If I wanted you just to be
food for something,

I'd call you Elsie
and put a cowbell on you.

36:09.467 --> 36:11.633
Being real young,
my mother passed away,

36:11.667 --> 36:14.467
so I try to teach them
as much as I know,

it took us a few days,
but, uh...

36:35.133 --> 36:39.467
Because it's got to
cost a bit much to fly
down this way to Kotzebue,

36:39.500 --> 36:41.500
and get in a boat,
and go out hunting.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.200
We need to at least get
one seal
to make up for the money

36:44.233 --> 36:46.133
that it costs me
to fly down here.

36:47.267 --> 36:48.867
Something on top the ice.

36:48.900 --> 36:51.500
We're way far.
Half ways to land.

36:51.533 --> 36:54.900
That's like six miles
and two bends away.

36:58.700 --> 36:59.967
AGNES: Oh, son.

37:01.833 --> 37:02.900
(GUNSHOT)

37:04.000 --> 37:05.567
JON: Where'd it go?

37:07.667 --> 37:09.533
Harpoon, harpoon, harpoon!

37:10.133 --> 37:11.733
AGNES: Harpoon, Ting.

37:11.767 --> 37:13.567
You gotta be ready.
It's still swimming.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.733
JON: Gotta be ready, Ting.

37:14.767 --> 37:16.233
AGNES: It's wounded.
JON: Coming right back up.

37:16.267 --> 37:17.633
It has no air.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.067
AGNES: Oh, son, I got it!

37:24.367 --> 37:25.500
(GUNSHOT)

37:26.100 --> 37:27.100
Ooh!

37:33.400 --> 37:34.967
JON: Harpoon it! Harpoon it!

37:35.700 --> 37:36.700
Oh!

37:39.033 --> 37:41.200
I see him. He's floating.
He's floating.

37:41.233 --> 37:42.933
Didn't go far though.
Looks like a young one.

37:46.633 --> 37:47.767
Mom, harpoon it!

37:48.633 --> 37:49.800
Harpoon.

37:53.533 --> 37:54.533
There we go.

37:59.100 --> 38:00.767
Now let's go and grab him.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.067
AGNES:
Hurry up before it sink.
It got a hole in it.

38:03.100 --> 38:05.733
JON: Ting that was
a little bit early
when you tried to harpoon it.

38:05.767 --> 38:06.867
A little bit early.

38:08.433 --> 38:09.800
AGNES: Where's that hook?

38:17.233 --> 38:19.433
You gotta go below, below.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.033
JON: There we go.

38:21.067 --> 38:23.700
AGNES: Up this way.
Up front. Up front.

38:23.733 --> 38:25.167
-JON: There you go.
-(AGNES GRUNTS)

38:28.133 --> 38:30.267
JON: Ready?
AGNES: One, two, three, go.
(STRAINS)

38:31.733 --> 38:33.000
JON: Whoa.

38:36.467 --> 38:37.533
AGNES: We did it.

38:37.567 --> 38:38.600
JON: Friggin' awesome.

38:38.633 --> 38:40.167
AGNES: I'm real grateful
for this seal.

38:40.200 --> 38:41.700
I'm glad it gave itself to us.

38:41.733 --> 38:45.133
I paid it my respects
and gave it
a last drink of water,

38:45.167 --> 38:48.033
and so, uh, hopefully
I'll have some more good luck.

38:48.067 --> 38:50.067
Okay, kids ready?
Shall we head home?

38:50.100 --> 38:51.100
Yep.

38:55.467 --> 38:57.633
AGNES: Well, I managed
to pull off a successful hunt.

38:57.667 --> 38:59.500
I got one seal in the boat,

38:59.533 --> 39:04.433
and I managed to keep
everybody safe and alive,
and we're all still happy.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.133
Not too small.

39:09.167 --> 39:11.100
Not too big.

39:11.133 --> 39:12.800
Just perfect.

39:12.833 --> 39:14.700
One seal. Took us a few days,

39:14.733 --> 39:16.933
but, uh, Chip's gonna be
real happy.

39:16.967 --> 39:18.700
A bloody mess.

39:18.733 --> 39:21.067
The mess of success.

39:21.100 --> 39:22.867
One, two, three, go!

39:24.667 --> 39:25.667
Yee!

39:30.000 --> 39:33.033
CODY: The number one concern
for me out here
is gonna be hurting myself.

39:34.533 --> 39:37.167
I think the idea of 9-1-1
back in the city

39:37.200 --> 39:39.600
or having an ambulance
being able to come
and get you,

39:39.633 --> 39:41.733
people don't realise
how comforting that can be.

39:45.467 --> 39:47.233
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

39:53.400 --> 39:54.667
ANDY:
See you got your stove going.

39:54.700 --> 39:57.200
So why don't we go out
and collect some
spruce boughs.

39:57.233 --> 39:58.700
-Get a bed made.
-Okay.

39:58.733 --> 40:00.800
And we'll go back in the woods
a little away from the house

40:00.833 --> 40:04.067
so we're not deforesting
the area around the house
right now.

40:05.933 --> 40:09.033
What you're gonna wanna do
is just come in here

40:09.067 --> 40:11.033
and just start
going down the tree.

40:11.067 --> 40:12.667
-Take the boughs off.
-Yeah.

40:12.700 --> 40:16.967
Sometimes you can even
just take down
a whole tree like this.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.733
Right? When I was out trapping
that was my base.

40:19.767 --> 40:22.033
-That would get laid down
like that.
-Mmm-hmm.

40:22.067 --> 40:25.067
As I laid down on it,
it just kind of scrunched
all those down.

40:25.100 --> 40:28.400
And then you take
these smaller, finer ones

40:28.433 --> 40:30.733
and you start building
a good bed.

40:30.767 --> 40:32.333
Build it up in a mound.

40:32.367 --> 40:33.567
'Cause as you sleep in it...

40:33.600 --> 40:35.533
-It's gonna sag down.
-It's gonna sag down.

40:35.567 --> 40:37.133
It creates
a nice little nest for you.

40:37.167 --> 40:38.700
-Okay.
-Just go through.

40:38.733 --> 40:42.067
You can just start
taking stuff down
wherever it's convenient.

40:42.100 --> 40:44.400
I would suggest try
and get as much snow
off of it,

40:44.433 --> 40:45.900
because as soon as you bring
it inside...

40:45.933 --> 40:47.000
-It's gonna melt.
-It's gonna melt,

40:47.033 --> 40:48.233
and then
everything will be wet.

40:48.267 --> 40:51.233
So just make it as comfortable
as you can tonight,

40:51.267 --> 40:52.733
and we'll see how you are
in the morning.

40:52.767 --> 40:54.133
-Sounds good.
-All right.

40:54.167 --> 40:55.233
-Thank you, Andy.
-Yeah.

40:55.267 --> 40:56.500
You're doing good.

40:59.167 --> 41:02.300
ANDY: So what's gonna
be interesting for me to see
in the next couple of days

41:02.333 --> 41:06.000
as we get into more
challenging things is,
what's his gut instinct?

41:06.033 --> 41:07.267
You know,
is he the kind of guy

41:07.300 --> 41:09.833
that goes charging up
to the edge of the river
and looks over?

41:09.867 --> 41:13.300
Or is he the kind of guy
that, kind of, walks up
and kind of tests the ice?

41:13.333 --> 41:16.100
And those are the
little subtle things
that I'm gonna look for,

41:16.133 --> 41:18.300
and that'll tell me
a lot about him

41:18.333 --> 41:20.633
and, uh,
where his headspace is at.

41:23.967 --> 41:25.900
Definitely did not think
I'd be sleeping on a tree

41:25.933 --> 41:28.067
when I, uh, got off
that plane today.

41:28.100 --> 41:31.267
But I don't think I can assume
anything out here.

41:35.800 --> 41:38.733
Guess we can call
this part of the woods
the mattress store.

41:38.767 --> 41:41.033
Definitely gonna be a change
from the Tempur-Pedic.

41:42.800 --> 41:48.067
I think people have gotten
really content with living
in the lower 48

41:48.100 --> 41:50.167
and don't really
take into consideration

41:50.200 --> 41:52.600
how much you can appreciate
the stuff you have around you.

41:52.633 --> 41:54.467
Kind of takes coming out
somewhere like this,

41:54.500 --> 41:58.267
and realising that,
uh, a computer game
isn't that important.

42:20.000 --> 42:25.200
Basically the idea of it is,
if you're gonna be taking
the dogs out somewhere,

42:25.233 --> 42:28.633
and spending somewhere
out away from the cabin
for a night,

42:28.667 --> 42:31.133
you would make a bed like this

42:31.167 --> 42:34.233
in order to keep yourself
from laying just on snow.

42:34.267 --> 42:36.300
Because that would be
the equivalent of laying
on an ice cube,

42:36.333 --> 42:38.700
and nobody wants to lay
on ice.

42:38.733 --> 42:40.000
Throw a tarp up over it.

42:44.300 --> 42:48.200
I think this is nature's way
of making memory foam.

42:48.967 --> 42:50.200
Let's give it a try.

42:57.767 --> 42:59.600
Oh, yeah. (EXHALES)

42:59.633 --> 43:02.067
This is probably
the most uncomfortable bed
I've ever made,

43:02.100 --> 43:06.133
but it's definitely better
than sleeping on a
plank of wood or on snow.

43:07.400 --> 43:09.933
(HOWLING)
