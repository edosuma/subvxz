you can let Cyd in now.

But I'm offended.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.189
Well I told you not to be.
I did everything I could.

03:11.111 --> 03:13.023
You know what,
Dax made his first website

03:13.023 --> 03:15.075
when he was a sophomore
just like me.

03:15.075 --> 03:17.408
I think I have a pretty

investing in my site.

If I know Dax...
And I don't...

this screw left.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.132
You think I missed a step?

07:03.844 --> 07:06.136
Maybe building motorcycles
isn't your thing.

but not the craft you made,

09:00.210 --> 09:02.252

how to craft that craft...
 No!

Look, let me just save you
a little bit of time,
all right?

09:07.758 --> 09:10.931
I won't refresh my browser
for a website with less than
10,000 users.

09:15.806 --> 09:17.808
Twelve thousand?

09:17.808 --> 09:21.101
Twelve thousand?
All right, you've got
my attention.

09:22.482 --> 09:25.065
(EXHALES) Mr. Fraggins,

09:25.065 --> 09:28.448
what is the most desirable
yet untapped market
on the Internet?

09:28.448 --> 09:31.652
Cats with credit cards.

09:31.652 --> 09:35.495
Well, I'm talking about
a website that offers
exclusive access

09:35.495 --> 09:37.868
to the close-knit Portland

09:38.789 --> 09:40.751
Nobody's cracked
the crafters.

09:40.751 --> 09:42.873

stringing beads together,

sandwich sauces.

10:21.451 --> 10:23.543
And this is Tradeskees

10:27.878 --> 10:31.672
So you see, I'm not just
pitching you a website,

10:31.672 --> 10:33.804
I'm pitching you a community.

10:33.804 --> 10:36.466
Ninety-five percent
of households contain
a crafter,

10:36.466 --> 10:39.760
and Tradeskees is a way
to reach every single one.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.222
So what do you say,
Mr. Fraggins?

10:42.222 --> 10:44.474
Are we ready to
take Tradeskees
to the next level?

10:48.648 --> 10:51.772
I'll think about it.
Send in number 10.

10:52.773 --> 10:53.904
Oh, I thought...

10:53.904 --> 10:56.446
Don't think. That's my job.
Just send in 10.

11:04.785 --> 11:07.337
Okay, so building motorcycles
wasn't your thing.

11:07.337 --> 11:10.210
Yeah, neither was cooking,
painting, close-up magic,

11:10.210 --> 11:12.713
street surfing,
model trains,
bird watching,

11:12.713 --> 11:14.634
aerial gymnastics,
real estate investing,

11:14.634 --> 11:18.348
amateur dentistry,
animal husbandry,
cheese-making or reading.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.561
That's why I brought you
to the mall.

11:21.561 --> 11:23.854
If we can't find
your thing here,
then so help me,

11:23.854 --> 11:26.897
I'll just pick up the items
I came for and we can leave.

11:27.978 --> 11:30.070
(WHIRRING)

11:33.273 --> 11:35.275
Naldo...

11:35.275 --> 11:37.487
Cyd, there is no way
you can do that...

11:37.487 --> 11:40.030
But what if chainsaw
sculpting is my thing?

11:40.030 --> 11:41.531
You didn't let me finish!

11:41.531 --> 11:43.623
I was gonna say there is
no way you can do that...

11:43.623 --> 11:46.787
Without all the necessary
safety equipment!

11:46.787 --> 11:48.538
Why did you pause like that?

11:48.538 --> 11:50.710
Pause like... What?

11:52.212 --> 11:53.503
I don't have time for this.

11:55.836 --> 11:57.758
(WHIRRING)

11:57.758 --> 11:59.639
(YELLING)

12:06.977 --> 12:08.228
(WHIRRING STOPS)

12:11.812 --> 12:14.484
I think my log was broken.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.696
It was supposed to have
a bear in it!

12:19.449 --> 12:20.861
Oh, Cyd.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.462
That was the last pitch.

12:32.462 --> 12:34.584
Dax has heard
everybody's ideas.

12:34.584 --> 12:37.217
Now we just wait and see
who he's investing in.

12:37.217 --> 12:40.760
I'm so nervous,
I'm sweating
in my knee pits.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.472
Shelby, there's no reason
to be nervous.

12:42.472 --> 12:44.935
Because any second now,
Dax is going to come out,

12:44.935 --> 12:47.187
say that he's heard
no good pitches today,

12:47.187 --> 12:48.979
at which point,
I will swing back around

12:48.979 --> 12:52.602
with my newly repaired
hologram and win the day.

12:52.602 --> 12:54.524
(BEEPS)
 You the man, Barry!

12:55.655 --> 12:57.777
See? He doesn't say
anything offensive now.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.609
I made him
nothing but positive.

13:00.610 --> 13:03.323
(BEEPS)
 How great is this guy?

13:03.323 --> 13:04.704
I know he's saying
nice things,

13:04.704 --> 13:07.707
but his Barry face
makes me think he's lying.

13:07.707 --> 13:10.370
(BEEPS)
 Your opinions are valid!

13:12.913 --> 13:14.714
Listen up, people,

13:14.714 --> 13:17.918
I'm sorry to say
that there were
no good pitches today.

13:19.009 --> 13:21.341
But there was a great one.

13:21.341 --> 13:24.184
Shelby Marcus, you owe me
a new pair of socks.

13:24.184 --> 13:25.595
'Cause you knocked mine off.

13:28.728 --> 13:30.140
He picked me?

13:30.140 --> 13:32.272
I can't think of anyone
more deserving.

13:32.272 --> 13:34.434
What about me?
 Lookin' good!

13:36.236 --> 13:38.859
That's right, I'm investing
in Tradeskees.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.650
We're gonna take you global!

13:40.650 --> 13:42.282
(APPLAUSE)

13:44.784 --> 13:47.707
Um, Mr. Fraggins!
If I could just give you
a quick demonstration...

13:47.707 --> 13:50.210
Send me the contract. Yeah.

13:50.210 --> 13:52.913
I'll get the Marcus girl
to sign Tradeskees over to me

13:52.913 --> 13:54.794
and then I'll cut her out
completely.

13:54.794 --> 13:56.546
(BEEPS)
 Now that's a plan!

13:56.546 --> 13:57.958
Shh! Not now!
 (BEEPS)

14:02.762 --> 14:04.514
Just send me the contract.

14:06.306 --> 14:08.348
(SIGHS) I have to warn Shelby.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.310
Ooh, have you been
doing push-ups?

14:10.310 --> 14:13.023
Stop patronizing me.
You know I haven't.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.901
Well, snorkeling
isn't my thing.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.323
Yeah, if you got
grossed out in the hot tub,

14:23.323 --> 14:24.784
you probably won't like
the ocean.

14:24.784 --> 14:27.908
The pool guy never skims it.

14:27.908 --> 14:30.410
I'm never gonna
find my thing.
This is pointless.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.794
Why's it so important
that you find your thing?

14:34.794 --> 14:36.126
I don't know, it's just...

14:36.126 --> 14:38.458
All of you guys have things
you're passionate about.

14:38.458 --> 14:40.170
What if I never find
my thing?

14:40.170 --> 14:42.092
Cyd, we'll keep looking.

14:42.092 --> 14:44.764
There's no point.
It's just a waste of time.

14:49.970 --> 14:51.932
Despite the comical
appearance of
what's going on,

14:51.932 --> 14:53.643
I'm still super sad
on the inside.

14:57.687 --> 15:00.900
Thank you.
I'm very excited.
(CHUCKLES)

15:00.900 --> 15:02.522
There's my superstar!

15:02.522 --> 15:04.904
Oh, thank goodness.
He would not let go.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.988
My lawyer sent over
the contract.

15:07.988 --> 15:10.870
All you have to do is sign it
and we're good to go.

15:10.870 --> 15:12.412
I can't believe it!

15:12.412 --> 15:14.955
The Dax Fraggins is going to
help me use Tradeskees

15:14.955 --> 15:17.417
to unite crafters
all over the world.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.709
I remember when I sold
my first website.

15:19.709 --> 15:21.751
You know what I did?

15:21.751 --> 15:23.593
I signed the contract
real quick before
they could take it back.

15:23.593 --> 15:25.545
You're gonna take it back?
 Not if you sign it real quick.

15:26.256 --> 15:28.138
No, Shelby, don't!

15:28.138 --> 15:29.759
Barry, what are you doing?

15:29.759 --> 15:30.890
You can't sign that!

15:30.890 --> 15:34.184
Dax is gonna get rid of you
and take over Tradeskees.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.936
Why would I do that?
Shelby is Tradeskees.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.149
You know,
this always happens.

15:39.149 --> 15:41.901
You blow up and even
your friends turn on you.

15:41.901 --> 15:43.483
I'm just trying
to protect you.

15:43.483 --> 15:46.776
No, you're just jealous
that Dax didn't choose
your hologram.

15:46.776 --> 15:48.948
You know,
you don't have to
listen to this...

15:48.948 --> 15:50.740
If you put on these.

15:54.834 --> 15:56.626
I'm signing it.

15:56.626 --> 15:57.837
All right!

15:57.837 --> 15:59.579
Let's go celebrate, partner.

15:59.579 --> 16:00.880
You ever eat cheetah?

16:00.880 --> 16:03.383
No.
 Yeah, me neither.
It's gross.

16:09.759 --> 16:11.891
So, now that
I've signed the contract

16:11.891 --> 16:13.853
and we're working together
on Tradeskees,

16:13.853 --> 16:15.265
let's talk office layout.

16:15.265 --> 16:17.897
Should we put our desks
like this or like this?

16:17.897 --> 16:19.229
(GASPS) Bunk desks!

16:19.229 --> 16:23.863
I call the bottom,
'cause, you know, skirts.

16:23.863 --> 16:27.407
Actually, I was thinking
first we could increase
membership fees.

16:27.407 --> 16:28.948
But Tradeskees
doesn't have fees.

16:28.948 --> 16:31.491
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Let me riff off your riff.

16:31.491 --> 16:35.035
What if, and
I'm just brain jammin' here,
we charge fees?

16:35.995 --> 16:37.377
You can't do that!

16:37.377 --> 16:39.539
Of course I can.
And that's just the beginning.

16:39.539 --> 16:43.833
I'm gonna use Tradeskees
to squeeze every last dime
out of your beloved crafters.

16:43.833 --> 16:47.087
Thanks to you,
I'm in 95% of households.

16:47.087 --> 16:49.089
But my users trust me.

16:49.089 --> 16:51.051
I won't let you
do that to them.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.972
I thought you might say that.

16:54.554 --> 16:57.597
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
 (CELL PHONE BUZZES)

16:57.597 --> 17:00.770
This is an email saying
that I'm leaving Tradeskees?

17:00.770 --> 17:02.692
Yeah, we're real sorry
to see you go.

17:02.692 --> 17:04.854
It just felt like we were
on different pages.

17:06.945 --> 17:08.858
You can't take my website.

17:08.858 --> 17:10.240
I built it myself.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.242
Of course I can.

17:12.242 --> 17:15.825
I own Tradeskees now
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

17:15.825 --> 17:17.787
Peace out.
Bump me some knucks.

17:17.787 --> 17:18.867
Forget it!

17:18.867 --> 17:20.250
Come on,
don't leave me hanging.

17:22.372 --> 17:24.124
Why would you bump my knucks?

17:24.124 --> 17:26.086
I just stole your website!

17:34.264 --> 17:36.436
Shelby, you okay?

17:36.436 --> 17:38.138
No.

17:38.138 --> 17:40.180
You were right
about everything.

17:40.180 --> 17:41.441
I should have listened to you.

17:41.441 --> 17:42.982
You were just being
a good friend.

17:42.982 --> 17:44.184
No. No, I wasn't.

17:44.184 --> 17:45.985
I was a total jerk all day.

17:45.985 --> 17:48.738
I never should have said
those things about Tradeskees.

17:48.738 --> 17:50.320
I wouldn't have
listened to me either.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.401
I'm sorry.

17:57.457 --> 17:58.998
This is weird, right?
 Is it?

18:01.040 --> 18:02.041
We should just...
 Yeah.

18:08.168 --> 18:10.840
Hey, Cyd, I made you this
to cheer you up.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.422
Aw, is it apple?

18:12.422 --> 18:13.513
No, it's pie.

18:15.305 --> 18:17.847
I know you're bummed out,
but think of it this way...

18:17.847 --> 18:19.979
We know all the stuff
we tried today
isn't your thing,

18:19.979 --> 18:22.982
which means
you're that much closer
to finding out what is.

18:22.982 --> 18:24.564
Maybe you're right.

18:24.564 --> 18:28.568
And who knows,
maybe someday
my thing will even find me.

18:33.323 --> 18:36.156
Ugh, that is...
 Disgusting, right?

18:36.156 --> 18:37.657
Yeah, making pies
is not my thing.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.162
Dax Fraggins
invested in my website!

18:42.162 --> 18:43.373
Shelby, that's amazing.

18:43.373 --> 18:45.245
And then he completely
cut me out of it.

18:45.245 --> 18:48.007
Shelby, that's awful.
Why'd you pause like that?

18:48.007 --> 18:49.749
See what I mean?
It's confusing.

18:51.801 --> 18:53.303
Shelby, I'm so sorry.

18:53.303 --> 18:55.134
That Dax guy
sounds like a jerk.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.756
Yeah, a huge jerk.

18:56.756 --> 19:01.100
He stole Shelby's website
and didn't buy my hologram.

19:01.100 --> 19:04.023
But mostly the first thing,
which is why I said it first.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.147
We need to jump back to
before I signed that contract.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.229
Come on, Cyd, slap it in.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.941
What's wrong?

19:11.941 --> 19:14.984
Shelby, I don't think
not signing that contract
will fix this.

19:14.984 --> 19:18.328
If he did that to you,
what's to stop him from
doing it to someone else?

19:18.328 --> 19:21.080
Yeah, he could have stolen
Barry's hologram projector!

19:21.080 --> 19:24.204
You really think he would have
stolen my hologram projector?

19:24.204 --> 19:25.955
That's sweet of you
to say, Renaldo.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.959
We have to jump back
and teach Dax a lesson.

19:29.959 --> 19:32.292
We need to show everyone
what kind of guy he really is.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.509
Here we go.

19:39.509 --> 19:41.681
I hope Cyd's plan works.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.143
Okay, the lawyer
sent over the contract.

19:44.143 --> 19:46.516
All you have to do is sign it
and we're good to go.

19:49.068 --> 19:51.271
Cyd, what are you doing?

19:51.271 --> 19:53.152
I have to stop Shelby,
she's about to make
a huge mistake.

19:53.152 --> 19:55.525
Barry, don't worry,
we're way ahead of you.

19:55.525 --> 19:58.077
And contract signed!

19:58.077 --> 20:00.700
Great!
Let's go celebrate, partner.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.583
Why did you do that?
Shelby just
signed away Tradeskees!

20:03.583 --> 20:04.954
Exactly.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.747
Wait, you jumped here
from the future, didn't you?

20:07.747 --> 20:09.539
I must know, when do I die?

20:09.539 --> 20:12.502
I don't know. I just came here
from this afternoon
and you were alive then.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.294
Yes! Still alive!

20:15.635 --> 20:18.047
Come on, I need your help.
 Ahh!

20:21.511 --> 20:24.143
Now that I've
signed the contract,
let me make one thing clear,

20:24.143 --> 20:26.306
I'm in charge of Tradeskees.

20:26.306 --> 20:29.228
Uh. Let me make
one thing clear...
No, you're not.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.851
I own Tradeskees now.

20:31.851 --> 20:33.112
I can do anything
I want with it,

20:33.112 --> 20:35.355
including getting rid of you.

20:35.355 --> 20:37.817
I can't believe
I looked up to you.

20:37.817 --> 20:40.029
You were a sophomore
when you made
your first website here,

20:40.029 --> 20:41.321
just like me.
 Oh!

20:41.321 --> 20:43.242
You are so naive.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.204
I didn't make that website.
I stole it!

20:45.204 --> 20:48.207
Just like I stole
every other websites
I "created."

20:48.207 --> 20:49.499
Why would you do that?

20:49.499 --> 20:52.462
For the money!

20:52.462 --> 20:55.335
I've built my fortune
off chumps like you.

20:55.335 --> 20:58.177
"Dax, make me rich!
Make me famous!"

20:58.177 --> 20:59.299
That's what chumps sound like.

21:01.010 --> 21:02.682
Well you're not
getting Tradeskees.

21:02.682 --> 21:04.143
You already signed it away.

21:04.514 --> 21:05.845
Or did I?

21:07.096 --> 21:08.057
Just read what I wrote.

21:10.350 --> 21:12.482
"You're in a hologram"?

21:12.482 --> 21:13.693
What does that mean?

21:19.949 --> 21:23.072
It means everyone heard
what you said.

21:23.072 --> 21:26.786
"Aw, they tricked me!
Everyone knows I'm a liar!"

21:26.786 --> 21:28.247
That's what jerks sound like.

21:30.169 --> 21:32.332
And your humiliation
wouldn't have been possible

21:32.332 --> 21:34.624
without my portable
hologram projector!

21:34.624 --> 21:37.006
Mr. Fraggins,
if I could just have a moment
of your time...

21:37.006 --> 21:38.087
BOTH: Barry!
 Right.

21:39.469 --> 21:40.510
This isn't fair!

21:41.220 --> 21:44.183
You guys are huge meanies!

21:44.183 --> 21:47.347
I'm taking my gym
and my library
and my football field

21:47.347 --> 21:48.388
and I'm going home!

21:48.388 --> 21:50.390
(ALL BOOING)

21:52.191 --> 21:56.235
I can't believe I ever wanted
to be the next Dax Fraggins.

21:56.235 --> 21:58.067
You're gonna be
something better.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.069
You're gonna be
the first Shelby Marcus.

22:06.406 --> 22:09.288
Barry hugs so weird.
 I know, right?

22:10.329 --> 22:11.210
Do I?

22:19.048 --> 22:21.551
Wow, using
Barry's hologram projector

22:21.551 --> 22:24.634
to trick Dax into thinking
he was in the classroom
was genius.

22:24.634 --> 22:26.135
It was all Cyd's idea.

22:26.135 --> 22:28.598
She's like some sort of
revenge artist.

22:28.598 --> 22:31.350
Hey, Cyd, maybe revenge
is your thing!

22:31.350 --> 22:34.644
I don't know. I only use it
to get back at people
who mess with Shelby.

22:34.644 --> 22:37.026
Or me.
Or you guys.

22:37.026 --> 22:39.439
Or if it's funny.
Or if there's money involved.

22:39.439 --> 22:40.740
Or tacos.

22:42.321 --> 22:45.324
Huh, maybe you're right,
revenge is my thing.

22:46.325 --> 22:48.448
Destroy all humans!

22:48.448 --> 22:50.079
Destroy all humans!

22:50.079 --> 22:52.371
Destroy all humans!

22:52.371 --> 22:54.544
Uh-oh!
 I didn't teach him that.

22:54.544 --> 22:56.796
He's become self-aware!
We have to get out of here!

22:56.796 --> 22:58.257
Where are the nearest caves?

23:01.761 --> 23:03.052
I taught him that.

23:03.923 --> 23:05.344
Revenge.

23:05.344 --> 23:06.506
Revenge for what?

23:06.506 --> 23:08.217
Okay, call it pre-venge.

23:08.217 --> 23:10.179
We all know
Barry's gonna do
something annoying eventually.

23:12.562 --> 23:14.063
She's terrifying!

23:15.305 --> 23:21.458
