<c.speakerTop>Today, Isabel is taking

01:06.833 --> 01:10.333
<c.speakerTop>her first college class
at the Science Academy!

01:10.333 --> 01:12.416
<c.speakerTop>[Luisa]
Ay, Francisco.

01:12.416 --> 01:15.000
<c.speakerTop>You've already told
everyone in the palace.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.250
<c.speakerTop>Twice.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.833
<c.speakerTop>Oh! I can't believe
in exactly one hour,

01:17.833 --> 01:20.291
<c.speakerTop>13 minutes,
and 55 seconds,

01:20.291 --> 01:21.708
<c.speaker>my favorite scientist
of all time

01:21.708 --> 01:23.291
<c.speaker>is going to be my professor!

01:23.291 --> 01:25.083
<c.speaker>Hey, where's
your Go-Pack?

01:25.083 --> 01:26.333
<c.speaker>Oh. [laughs]

01:26.333 --> 01:28.083
<c.speaker>I must have forgotten it
in my room.

01:28.083 --> 01:29.333
<c.speaker>Well, you better
go get it!

01:29.333 --> 01:31.458
<c.speaker>Hurry, hurry!
Big day!

01:31.458 --> 01:34.166
<c.speaker>I'm so excited for you!

01:34.166 --> 01:35.416
<c.speaker>I'm so worried for her.

01:35.416 --> 01:37.291
<c.speaker>Oh, she'll be fine.

01:37.291 --> 01:40.083
<c.speaker>But she's going to college
with kids twice her age.

01:40.083 --> 01:43.000
<c.speaker>It's just one class
once a week, <i>mijita. </i>

01:43.000 --> 01:44.875
<c.speaker>You're right.

01:44.875 --> 01:47.458
<c.speaker>But... just to make sure
she gets off on the right foot,

01:47.458 --> 01:49.291
<c.speaker>how about I send
a royal guard unit with her?

01:49.291 --> 01:51.333
<c.speaker>-Hmm?
-Ay, Elena!

01:51.333 --> 01:54.166
<c.speaker>Or I could just drop her
off myself.

01:54.166 --> 01:55.333
<c.speaker>Better!

01:55.333 --> 01:58.250
<c.speaker>Señora Ríos!
Did you hear?

01:58.250 --> 02:00.375
<c.speaker>Isabel is taking
her first college class

02:00.375 --> 02:03.583
<c.speaker>at the Science Academy
today!

02:05.958 --> 02:07.333

<c.speaker>-Professor Ochoa!
-Oh!

02:21.375 --> 02:22.458
<c.speaker>--me.

02:22.458 --> 02:24.000
<c.speaker>I'm so honored
to be here.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.583
<c.speaker>I'm ready
to sleeve up my rolls--

02:25.583 --> 02:27.750
<c.speaker>I mean, roll up my sleeves
and get to work.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.583
<c.speaker>[laughs]

02:29.583 --> 02:33.208
<c.speaker>Well, you can start
by rolling up
these sleeves.

02:33.208 --> 02:34.708
<c.speaker>Wow!

02:34.708 --> 02:37.458
<c.speaker>My very own official
Science Academy lab coat?!

02:37.458 --> 02:39.375
<c.speaker>I'm going to to put it on
right now.

02:42.083 --> 02:44.583
<c.speaker>Whew! The students
are even older
than I expected.

02:44.583 --> 02:47.208
<c.speaker>And the school is huge.
[chuckles]

02:47.208 --> 02:48.375
<c.speaker>What if she gets lost?

02:48.375 --> 02:51.375
<c.speaker>We have some time
before class starts.

02:51.375 --> 02:53.500
<c.speaker>How about I give you
a little tour?

02:53.500 --> 02:54.500
<c.speaker>I'd love that.

02:54.500 --> 02:55.708
<c.speaker>Me, too.

02:55.708 --> 02:57.458
<c.speaker>Then step this way!

<c.speaker>Right, Professor Ochoa?

05:15.458 --> 05:18.125
<c.speaker>Isabel, when we first met,

05:18.125 --> 05:20.750
<c.speaker>I could tell you had
a spark for science

05:20.750 --> 05:24.166
<c.speaker>that's as special
as a Leonid meteor shower!

05:24.166 --> 05:25.333
<c.speaker>[both laughing]

05:25.333 --> 05:26.875
<c.speaker>Leonid meteor shower.

05:27.958 --> 05:29.291
<c.speaker>[laughing]

05:29.291 --> 05:31.500
<c.speaker>Whatever that is,
I agree.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.500
<c.speaker>Okay, guess
I'll be on my way.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.458
<c.speaker>Heh! Oh, okay.

05:36.458 --> 05:38.416
<c.speaker>Goodbye!

05:41.958 --> 05:44.583
<c.speaker>[straining] Mmph!

05:44.583 --> 05:46.458
<c.speaker>How about
I walk you to class?

05:46.458 --> 05:48.958
<c.speaker>If you really want to!

05:48.958 --> 05:52.333
<c.speaker>And that is
how you calculate

05:52.333 --> 05:54.250
<c.speaker>a conservation of momentum.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.500
<c.speaker>Ahh!

05:55.500 --> 05:57.750
<c.speaker>You all better get used
to this sight.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.583
<c.speaker>It won't be long
before I'm teaching this class.

05:59.583 --> 06:01.625
<c.speaker>-[door opens]
-[Ochoa] Is that so?

06:01.625 --> 06:03.416

Professor Ochoa!

06:03.416 --> 06:05.291
<c.speaker>I, uh... Heh heh!

06:05.291 --> 06:07.583
<c.speaker>I was just keeping
your chair warm for you.

06:07.583 --> 06:10.458
<c.speaker>You can keep
your own chair warm, Javier.

Princess Isabel!

06:16.583 --> 06:18.000
<c.speaker>In. My. Class.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.625
<c.speaker>Aah! Royal overload!

06:19.625 --> 06:21.875
<c.speaker>[giggling]

06:23.583 --> 06:26.291
<c.speaker>Remember,
you are a shower

06:26.291 --> 06:30.500
<c.speaker>of sparkly meteors
named Leonard?

06:31.875 --> 06:33.500
<c.speaker>See you at the palace.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.000
<c.speaker>[kiss]

06:35.000 --> 06:36.500
<c.speaker>No! Don't go!

06:37.583 --> 06:39.458
<c.speaker>Uh, uh, I mean,

06:39.458 --> 06:42.000
<c.speaker>perhaps Your Highness
could stay for the day?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.458
<c.speaker>You could observe the class
or assist the Professor.

06:44.458 --> 06:45.708
<c.speaker>[under her breath]
Sign my notebook.

06:47.583 --> 06:49.416
<c.speaker>I would love that!

06:49.416 --> 06:52.250
<c.speaker>I mean, if you don't
mind me sticking
around, Professor.

06:52.250 --> 06:54.500
<c.speaker>Not at all.
Now let's get to work.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.708
<c.speaker>Isabel, your lab partner
is Tomiko.

06:57.708 --> 06:58.833
<c.speaker>Yes!

06:58.833 --> 07:00.458
<c.speaker>[laughing]

<c.speaker>[cricket chirping]

07:04.208 --> 07:05.875
<c.speaker>[laughs]

07:05.875 --> 07:08.291
<c.speaker>It is an honor
to be your lab partner,

07:08.291 --> 07:10.833
<c.speaker>Princess Isabel
Castillo-Flores of Avalor.

07:10.833 --> 07:13.458
<c.speaker>Oh, uh,
you can call me Isa.

07:13.458 --> 07:14.708
<c.speaker>-Can I?
-Oh!

07:14.708 --> 07:16.375
<c.speaker>Oh, sorry. I was just--

07:16.375 --> 07:17.958
<c.speaker>I was hoping you'd say that!

07:17.958 --> 07:20.083
<c.speaker>Now everyone follow me.

07:20.083 --> 07:23.000
<c.speaker>Our mental warm-up
will be outside today.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.833
<c.speaker>You're a lucky princess.

07:24.833 --> 07:27.458
<c.speaker>This class
is usually reserved

07:27.458 --> 07:28.875
<c.speaker>for the best
and the brightest.

07:28.875 --> 07:33.375
<c.speaker>But I guess the Professor
made a royal exception.

07:33.375 --> 07:36.291
<c.speaker>My sister is here
because Professor Ochoa

07:36.291 --> 07:38.708
<c.speaker>was impressed
with her guinea pig project.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.458
<c.speaker>It sounds cute.

07:40.458 --> 07:42.625
<c.speaker>Not exactly
a scientific breakthrough,

07:42.625 --> 07:44.750
<c.speaker>-but cute all the same.
-Mm!

07:44.750 --> 07:47.583
<c.speaker>Now, if you have trouble
keeping up, don't worry.

07:47.583 --> 07:50.291
<c.speaker>Everyone does
when I'm in the class.

07:50.291 --> 07:51.958
<c.speaker>Oh, ignore Javier.

07:51.958 --> 07:53.583
<c.speaker>He's just used to being
the youngest in this class.

07:53.583 --> 07:55.625
<c.speaker>But now
you're the youngest.

07:55.625 --> 07:57.625
<c.speaker>Plus, you're royal.

07:57.625 --> 08:00.750
<c.speaker>Royal or not,
I belong in this class
like everybody else.

08:00.750 --> 08:02.625
<c.speaker>And I'm going to prove it.

08:06.208 --> 08:09.750
<c.speaker>Today, you will conduct
the egg drop experiment

08:09.750 --> 08:12.583
<c.speaker>so you can see principles
of air resistance,

08:12.583 --> 08:15.750
<c.speaker>velocity,
and potential energy
in action.

08:15.750 --> 08:19.083
<c.speaker>I've been studying
potential energy in action
since I could read.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.708
<c.speaker>[scoffs]
Well, I've been studying it

08:20.708 --> 08:22.875
<c.speaker>since before I said
my first word...

08:22.875 --> 08:24.583
<c.speaker>centripetal force.

08:24.583 --> 08:25.708
<c.speaker>That's two words.

08:25.708 --> 08:27.708
<c.speaker>Which makes me
doubly impressive.

08:30.375 --> 08:32.333
<c.speaker>[forced laugh]

08:32.333 --> 08:35.708
<c.speaker>Each team has ten minutes
to design and build
an apparatus

08:35.708 --> 08:37.750
<c.speaker>that will protect the egg
from breaking

08:37.750 --> 08:40.458
<c.speaker>as it free falls
from the bell tower.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.750
<c.speaker>Your time starts... now!

08:44.750 --> 08:47.166
<c.speaker>Our apparatus
has to cradle the egg

08:47.166 --> 08:49.333
<c.speaker>in such a way that it
diverts the kinetic energy

08:49.333 --> 08:51.166
<c.speaker>away from the egg
at the point of impact.

08:51.166 --> 08:52.416
<c.speaker>Exactly.

08:52.416 --> 08:53.750
<c.speaker>What if we
surrounded the egg

08:53.750 --> 08:54.958
<c.speaker>with something
thick and bouncy?

08:54.958 --> 08:56.500
<c.speaker>Like a rubber sling!

08:56.500 --> 08:58.375
<c.speaker>Ooh! I know how to make
Avaloran rubber.

08:58.375 --> 09:01.875
<c.speaker>Whoa! You're like a princess
and a genius.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.291
<c.speaker>Okay, what do we need?

09:03.291 --> 09:05.708
<c.speaker>Elastica tree sap,
moon vine juice,

09:05.708 --> 09:07.750
<c.speaker>and equipment to mix
and mold the rubber.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.416
<c.speaker>I'll get the supplies.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.875
<c.speaker>And I'll sketch out
the sling design.

09:11.875 --> 09:14.875
<c.speaker>And I'll act like I know
what just happened.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.250
<c.speaker>[clink]

09:20.291 --> 09:22.000
<c.speaker>-Oh!
-Whoa!

09:27.750 --> 09:28.833
<c.speaker>[whistle]

09:28.833 --> 09:30.250
<c.speaker>Time's up!

09:30.250 --> 09:33.750
<c.speaker>Javier and Sheryl,
you're up first.

09:33.750 --> 09:36.208
<c.speaker>Three, two...

09:36.208 --> 09:37.750
<c.speaker>[whispering]
Who's number one?

09:45.625 --> 09:47.750
<c.speaker>No cracks!

09:47.750 --> 09:50.000
<c.speaker>Of course
there weren't.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.250
<c.speaker>Just call me
Professor Javier.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.875
<c.speaker>[Ochoa] Luke and Giselle,
you're next!

10:02.583 --> 10:03.958
<c.speaker>All good!

10:05.375 --> 10:08.250
<c.speaker>Isabel and Tomiko,
you're up.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.416
<c.speaker>This is so egg-citing.

10:10.416 --> 10:14.083
<c.speaker>That's egg-xactly
what I was going to say!

10:14.083 --> 10:15.833
<c.speaker>[both laughing]

10:15.833 --> 10:17.291
<c.speaker>[sighing]

10:20.583 --> 10:22.833
<c.speaker>Please don't crack.
Please don't crack.
Please don't crack.

10:22.833 --> 10:24.750
<c.speaker>Please don't crack.
Please don't crack.
Please don't crack.

10:33.250 --> 10:34.250
<c.speaker>[gasps]

10:36.875 --> 10:38.416
<c.speaker>-Oh!
-[gasps]

10:38.416 --> 10:39.875
<c.speaker>-[gasps]
-No!

10:42.208 --> 10:43.833
<c.speaker>[snickering]

10:43.833 --> 10:46.750
<c.speaker>She's not the only one
who has egg on her face.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.375
<c.speaker>[panting]

10:48.375 --> 10:49.708
<c.speaker>I'm so sorry.

10:49.708 --> 10:51.458
<c.speaker>Apology accepted.

10:51.458 --> 10:54.708
<c.speaker>But, Isabel, you're going
to have to do better.

10:59.583 --> 11:01.958
<c.speaker>Aw, don't feel bad,
Princess.

11:01.958 --> 11:05.333
<c.speaker>After all, you're not
a real college student.

11:05.333 --> 11:07.083
<c.speaker>Don't worry.
It was just the warm-up.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.958
<c.speaker>Yeah, you'll do better
on the next experiment.

11:09.958 --> 11:11.125
<c.speaker>I'm sure of it.

11:11.125 --> 11:12.750
<c.speaker>We'll see.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.875
<c.speaker>The models on your workstations
should look familiar.

11:23.875 --> 11:25.166
<c.speaker>It's Mount Diablo!

11:25.166 --> 11:26.166
<c.speaker>Correct.

11:26.166 --> 11:27.333
<c.speaker>Of course it is.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.000
<c.speaker>Mm!

11:30.000 --> 11:33.166
<c.speaker>The Academy is building
a new observatory

11:33.166 --> 11:34.625
<c.speaker>on top of Mount Diablo,

11:34.625 --> 11:37.000
<c.speaker>and they've asked
for our help.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
<c.speaker>Voila!

11:39.000 --> 11:41.333
<c.speaker>This is a model
of the new proposed observatory.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.833
<c.speaker>[students "oohing"]

11:42.833 --> 11:44.125
<c.speaker>That is gonna be great!

11:44.125 --> 11:45.208
<c.speaker>-[boy] Nice!
-[girl] Cool!

11:45.208 --> 11:46.875
<c.speaker>I could do better.

11:46.875 --> 11:50.000
<c.speaker>As you can see,
those enormous boulders

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
<c.speaker>make access
to the mountaintop difficult.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
<c.speaker>Your jobs are to figure out

11:55.000 --> 11:58.375
<c.speaker>how to get
the building materials
to the mountaintop.

11:58.375 --> 12:00.000
<c.speaker>Starting now!

12:00.000 --> 12:01.708
<c.speaker>What if we--

12:01.708 --> 12:03.250
<c.speaker>Pile the building materials
onto carriages

12:03.250 --> 12:04.583
<c.speaker>and drive them
around the boulders!

12:04.583 --> 12:06.000
<c.speaker>Tch!

12:06.000 --> 12:08.875
<c.speaker>Except that the gaps
between the boulders

12:08.875 --> 12:10.583
<c.speaker>are too narrow
for a carriage.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
<c.speaker>Oh, okay, so what
about a wheelbarrow?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.125
<c.speaker>They're small... er.

12:16.125 --> 12:17.500
<c.speaker>A bit too small.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.708
<c.speaker>They couldn't hold
the big blocks

12:18.708 --> 12:20.166
<c.speaker>we need to build
the observatory.

12:20.166 --> 12:22.333
<c.speaker>Tomiko, do you have
any ideas?

12:22.333 --> 12:25.000
<c.speaker>Dozens, but none
of them will work.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.958
<c.speaker>Hmm... how do we get
a bunch of blocks

12:26.958 --> 12:28.458
<c.speaker>past a bunch of rocks?

12:28.458 --> 12:32.083
<c.speaker>Hmm. What if the rocks
were the blocks?

12:32.083 --> 12:33.750
<c.speaker>-Huh?
-Huh?

12:33.750 --> 12:35.750
<c.speaker>Instead of trying
to get stuff
around the boulders,

12:35.750 --> 12:37.458
<c.speaker>why don't we
use the boulders
as the building blocks?

12:37.458 --> 12:39.875
<c.speaker>-Inspiration strikes!
-Aah!

12:39.875 --> 12:43.000
<c.speaker>We can use the boulders
to build the observatory!

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
<c.speaker>Good thinking, Isabel.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.125
<c.speaker>Yeah! Just like
a real college student.

12:48.125 --> 12:49.583
<c.speaker>Hmph!

12:49.583 --> 12:51.333
<c.speaker>But that doesn't
solve the problem

12:51.333 --> 12:54.375
<c.speaker>of getting
the building materials
up the mountain.

12:54.375 --> 12:56.708
<c.speaker>Those boulders are huge.

12:56.708 --> 12:58.291
<c.speaker>Absolutely right, Javier.

12:58.291 --> 12:59.583
<c.speaker>[Javier] I know.

12:59.583 --> 13:01.875
<c.speaker>But now,
instead of figuring out

13:01.875 --> 13:03.708
<c.speaker>how to get
around the boulders,

13:03.708 --> 13:05.083
<c.speaker>you have to figure out

13:05.083 --> 13:07.125
<c.speaker>how to get those boulders
up the mountain.

13:07.125 --> 13:09.458
<c.speaker>So fire up those brains!

13:09.458 --> 13:11.208
<c.speaker>Ooh! We could
lasso the boulders

13:11.208 --> 13:13.375
<c.speaker>and pull them
up the mountain!

13:13.375 --> 13:15.583
<c.speaker>There's not a rope
strong enough to do that.

13:15.583 --> 13:17.000
<c.speaker>It's okay, Elena.
Tomiko and I will-

13:17.000 --> 13:19.208
<c.speaker>We could get the whole town
together and push!

13:19.208 --> 13:20.500
<c.speaker>I really don't think--

13:20.500 --> 13:22.375
<c.speaker>Or we could ask the Jaquins
to carry them!

13:22.375 --> 13:24.750
<c.speaker>They couldn't even dig
their claws into the rock,

13:24.750 --> 13:25.875
<c.speaker>let alone lift them.

13:25.875 --> 13:27.375
<c.speaker>-Or...
-Hold on.

13:27.375 --> 13:30.083
<c.speaker>What if we built
a giant mechanical claw

13:30.083 --> 13:31.166
<c.speaker>that could grab
the boulders

13:31.166 --> 13:32.750
<c.speaker>and lift them up
the mountain?

13:32.750 --> 13:34.833
<c.speaker>Something like this?

13:34.833 --> 13:36.583
<c.speaker>Wow, you draw fast.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.000
<c.speaker>Yes! We just
need to anchor it
on the mountaintop

13:39.000 --> 13:40.583
<c.speaker>and create a counterweight
that can lift the boulders

13:40.583 --> 13:42.250
<c.speaker>and swing 'em over.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.875
<c.speaker>So we'll need
a sturdy base,
metal rods...

13:44.875 --> 13:46.208
<c.speaker>A clamp to hold
the claw together.

13:46.208 --> 13:48.833
<c.speaker>Rope, weights, wood,
bolts, and a spring coil.

13:48.833 --> 13:50.416
<c.speaker>-I'll go get 'em.
-That's okay, I'll do it.

13:50.416 --> 13:51.416
<c.speaker>Elena!

13:51.416 --> 13:52.583
<c.speaker>It'll save time.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.208
<c.speaker>You two work out
the details

13:54.208 --> 13:56.000
<c.speaker>of whatever it is
you need to calculate,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.208
<c.speaker>and I'll be right back.

13:57.208 --> 13:59.125
<c.speaker>Uh... okay.

14:00.083 --> 14:03.458
<c.speaker>Coils, coils, coils.

14:05.333 --> 14:08.000
<c.speaker>Did I hear you say
you're looking for coils?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.375
<c.speaker>Yes. Why?

14:10.375 --> 14:12.166
<c.speaker>Looks like they're all out.

14:12.166 --> 14:14.083
<c.speaker>Ah! Tough break.

14:14.083 --> 14:16.750
<c.speaker>Hmm, I wonder
what else Isa could use?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.125
<c.speaker>Hm!

14:25.083 --> 14:27.125
<c.speaker>Okay, there's no coils,

14:27.125 --> 14:30.875
<c.speaker>but I did find
a bunch of, uh, do-hickeys.

14:30.875 --> 14:33.708
<c.speaker>Actually, these gears
might work even better.

14:33.708 --> 14:35.208
<c.speaker>[growls]

14:35.208 --> 14:37.458
<c.speaker>Great! Now
how do we build it?

14:37.458 --> 14:39.708
<c.speaker>[sighs]
That's upside down.

14:39.708 --> 14:42.083
<c.speaker>Oops, sorry. [laughs]

14:42.083 --> 14:43.083
<c.speaker>Just trying to help.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.625
<c.speaker>[humming]

14:44.625 --> 14:46.583
<c.speaker>Tomiko, can you start
building the base

14:46.583 --> 14:48.291
<c.speaker>while I figure out
how to work in the gears?

14:48.291 --> 14:49.708
<c.speaker>I'd be honored!

14:53.208 --> 14:54.208
<c.speaker>Need anything?

14:54.208 --> 14:55.208
<c.speaker>I'm good.

14:55.208 --> 14:56.291
<c.speaker>How about you?

14:56.291 --> 14:59.125
<c.speaker>Just a little space.

14:59.125 --> 15:00.375
<c.speaker>Look at you two.

15:00.375 --> 15:02.958
<c.speaker>Shining bright
like a pair of photons.

15:04.333 --> 15:07.166
<c.speaker>Quick, work faster!
Shine brighter!

15:10.291 --> 15:13.375
<c.speaker>Are you sure
there's nothing I can do?

15:13.375 --> 15:16.291
<c.speaker>Uhh... you can hold
the design.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.583
<c.speaker>Ready, willing, and--

15:17.583 --> 15:19.000
<c.speaker>holding.

15:21.875 --> 15:23.833
<c.speaker>Okay. The gears fit
in like this.

15:23.833 --> 15:25.375
<c.speaker>All that's left
is the claw.

15:25.375 --> 15:27.333
<c.speaker>You hold the teeth,
I'll get the clamp.

15:28.833 --> 15:31.208
<c.speaker>Now we'll tie this rope
right here.

15:31.208 --> 15:34.000
<c.speaker>And tighten
this clamp, and...

15:34.000 --> 15:35.208
<c.speaker>We're done!

15:35.208 --> 15:36.416
<c.speaker>Ha! We're done!

15:36.416 --> 15:37.875
<c.speaker>We are done.

15:37.875 --> 15:40.166
<c.speaker>You're done? Before us?!

15:40.166 --> 15:42.166
<c.speaker>Are you ready
to show it to the class?

15:42.166 --> 15:43.750
<c.speaker>Mm. I think.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.125
<c.speaker>So ready.

15:53.583 --> 15:55.416
<c.speaker>-Oh!
-What was that?

15:55.416 --> 15:57.333
<c.speaker>[boy]
How did that happen?

15:57.333 --> 15:59.833
<c.speaker>[students conversing]

16:02.583 --> 16:04.125
<c.speaker>Hmm, that was unusual.

16:04.125 --> 16:06.458
<c.speaker>[nervous chuckle]
Sure was!

16:06.458 --> 16:11.500
<c.speaker>Now let's see the princess'
big boulder-lifting machine
in action.

16:13.125 --> 16:15.291
<c.speaker>First we lower the arm,
like this.

16:17.875 --> 16:20.083
<c.speaker>Next, the claw
picks up the boulder.

16:21.208 --> 16:23.875
<c.speaker>And, finally,
we'll move the boulder

16:23.875 --> 16:25.291
<c.speaker>to the top
of the mountain.

16:25.291 --> 16:26.583
<c.speaker>[gears clicking]

16:28.083 --> 16:29.166
<c.speaker>-Whoa!
-No!

16:29.166 --> 16:30.375
<c.speaker>-Aah!
-Oh!

16:31.583 --> 16:33.750
<c.speaker>Whew! I'm going
to have to start

16:33.750 --> 16:35.166
<c.speaker>wearing
a helmet in class.

16:35.166 --> 16:36.458
<c.speaker>[chuckles]

16:36.458 --> 16:38.000
<c.speaker>That's a shame.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.208
<c.speaker>Maybe you should stick
to guinea pigs.

16:40.208 --> 16:43.125
<c.speaker>Uh, we can
rebuild it.

16:43.125 --> 16:44.625
<c.speaker>What's the point?

16:44.625 --> 16:46.583
<c.speaker>Professor Ochoa told me
I had to do better,

16:46.583 --> 16:48.250
<c.speaker>and I did worse.

16:48.250 --> 16:49.750
<c.speaker>She's going to kick me
out for sure.

16:49.750 --> 16:53.458
<c.speaker>Don't worry.
I'll talk to her.

16:53.458 --> 16:55.250
<c.speaker>How 'bout that?

16:55.250 --> 16:57.000
<c.speaker>I have a harder head
than I thought.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
<c.speaker>[tapping]

16:58.000 --> 16:59.458
<c.speaker>I'm so glad you're okay.

16:59.458 --> 17:04.750
<c.speaker>Look, I know Isabel's
had a few, uh, mishaps?

17:04.750 --> 17:07.166
<c.speaker>But she does belong
in your class.

17:07.166 --> 17:10.625
<c.speaker>Oh, I agree.
But does Isabel?

17:10.625 --> 17:12.083
<c.speaker>What do you mean?

17:17.250 --> 17:19.250
<c.speaker>Isabel,
where are you going?

17:19.250 --> 17:20.583
<c.speaker>Class isn't over.

17:20.583 --> 17:21.875
<c.speaker>It is for me.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.875
<c.speaker>I can never show my face
in there again.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.333
<c.speaker>You don't mean that.

17:25.333 --> 17:26.458
<c.speaker>You've been talking
about going

17:26.458 --> 17:28.333
<c.speaker>to the Science Academy
forever.

17:28.333 --> 17:30.875
<c.speaker>That was before I hit
my favorite scientist
in the head.

17:30.875 --> 17:31.875
<c.speaker>Twice!

17:31.875 --> 17:33.875
<c.speaker>Mm, first day jitters?

17:33.875 --> 17:36.875
<c.speaker>I'd hate to see
what I would do to her
on the second day.

17:36.875 --> 17:38.625
<c.speaker>Javier is right.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.625
<c.speaker>I don't belong here.

17:40.625 --> 17:43.125
<c.speaker>Just because you made
a couple mistakes?

17:43.125 --> 17:45.625
<c.speaker>Science Academy students
don't make mistakes.

17:45.625 --> 17:47.000
<c.speaker>You saw them.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.125
<c.speaker>Everything they do
comes out right...

17:49.125 --> 17:51.083
<c.speaker>unless I'm their partner.

17:51.083 --> 17:54.583
<c.speaker>Okay, look,
if you want to quit,
that's your decision.

17:54.583 --> 17:58.208
<c.speaker>But you should tell
Professor Ochoa in person.

17:58.208 --> 17:59.625
<c.speaker>It's the right thing to do.

17:59.625 --> 18:02.375
<c.speaker>[sighs]

18:04.416 --> 18:06.208
<c.speaker>Go on.

18:10.208 --> 18:13.083
<c.speaker>Isabel. I was wondering
where you went.

18:13.083 --> 18:15.416
<c.speaker>Professor Ochoa?

18:15.416 --> 18:20.166
<c.speaker>I-- I just wanted to say,
thank you for letting me
take your class.

18:20.166 --> 18:22.333
<c.speaker>But I'm obviously
not cut out to be here.

18:22.333 --> 18:24.875
<c.speaker>I'm sorry I let you down.

18:24.875 --> 18:27.208
<c.speaker>How did you let me down?

18:27.208 --> 18:28.583
<c.speaker>I failed all day,

18:28.583 --> 18:30.291
<c.speaker>and I'll probably
just keep on failing.

18:30.291 --> 18:31.583
<c.speaker>Of course you will.

18:31.583 --> 18:33.583
<c.speaker>That's how you succeed.

18:33.583 --> 18:35.000
<c.speaker>Huh?

18:35.000 --> 18:36.333
<c.speaker>Isabel, take a look.

18:36.333 --> 18:37.416
<c.speaker>[groaning]

18:37.416 --> 18:39.333
<c.speaker>The other students
all failed, too.

18:39.333 --> 18:40.583
<c.speaker>They did?

18:40.583 --> 18:43.250
<c.speaker>When I tell my students
they have to do better,

18:43.250 --> 18:45.500
<c.speaker>I mean they have
to learn from their mistakes

18:45.500 --> 18:47.416
<c.speaker>and then try again.

18:47.416 --> 18:52.000
<c.speaker>Trying again is what makes
a scientist a scientist.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.583
<c.speaker>So the only way
you can let me down
is if you quit.

19:06.416 --> 19:08.875
<c.speaker>Welcome back, partner.

19:08.875 --> 19:11.375
<c.speaker>All right.
Where do we start?

19:11.375 --> 19:14.708
<c.speaker>Uh, Elena? Thank you
for always being
here for me,

19:14.708 --> 19:16.458
<c.speaker>but you can't
do <i>this </i>for me.

19:16.458 --> 19:18.416
<c.speaker>I need to prove
that I can do it.

19:18.416 --> 19:20.625
<c.speaker>You're absolutely right.

19:20.625 --> 19:21.625
<c.speaker>Good luck.

19:21.625 --> 19:22.875
<c.speaker>Thanks.

19:22.875 --> 19:25.375
<c.speaker>Hey, what happened
to the clamp

19:25.375 --> 19:26.875
<c.speaker>that was holding
the claw?

19:26.875 --> 19:28.416
<c.speaker>Hmm. Must've broken off.

19:28.416 --> 19:29.625
<c.speaker>I'll get a stronger one.

19:29.625 --> 19:31.333
<c.speaker>Ah, wouldn't you know it?

19:31.333 --> 19:33.375
<c.speaker>The supply room
is fresh out of clamps.

19:33.375 --> 19:35.458
<c.speaker>Now what are we
going to do?

19:36.875 --> 19:39.375
<c.speaker>Learn from your mistakes.

19:39.375 --> 19:41.458
<c.speaker>[gasp] The rubber sling!

19:41.458 --> 19:43.708
<c.speaker>-What about it?
-That's what we need!

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
<c.speaker>This goes here.
That goes there.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.375
<c.speaker>And, done!

19:53.375 --> 19:56.416
<c.speaker>A slingshot
catapult thingy!

19:56.416 --> 19:57.875
<c.speaker>Brilliant!

19:57.875 --> 20:01.250
<c.speaker>Professor Ochoa,
we're ready to try again.

20:01.250 --> 20:02.250
<c.speaker>[growls]

20:03.291 --> 20:06.458
<c.speaker>Okay. Now I'm ready.

20:14.750 --> 20:16.875
<c.speaker>Would ya look at that.

20:16.875 --> 20:19.458
<c.speaker>You broke your boulder
to bits.

20:19.458 --> 20:20.750
<c.speaker>That was the point.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.416
<c.speaker>We calculated
the exact angle

20:22.416 --> 20:24.208
<c.speaker>to purposely break up
the boulder

20:24.208 --> 20:26.708
<c.speaker>so it'll be easier
to carve the pieces
into building blocks.

20:28.250 --> 20:30.083
<c.speaker>That is...

20:30.083 --> 20:31.625
<c.speaker>genius!

20:31.625 --> 20:34.416
<c.speaker>Congratulations,
Isabel and Tomiko.

20:34.416 --> 20:36.750
<c.speaker>We are going to use
your machine

20:36.750 --> 20:39.000
<c.speaker>to help build
the observatory.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
<c.speaker>What?!

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
<c.speaker>I have
the best lab partner ever!

20:43.000 --> 20:44.833
<c.speaker>And not just because
you're a royal.

20:44.833 --> 20:46.250
<c.speaker>Although,
I'm not gonna lie,

20:46.250 --> 20:48.166
<c.speaker>that part is awesome!

20:48.166 --> 20:49.458
<c.speaker>You can't choose
their machine, Professor!

20:49.458 --> 20:51.208
<c.speaker>She's just a kid!

20:51.208 --> 20:53.375
<c.speaker>Ohh! Unh!

20:53.375 --> 20:57.208
<c.speaker>Hey, that's
the missing clamp
from our first machine.

20:57.208 --> 20:58.583
<c.speaker>How'd it get under there?

20:58.583 --> 21:01.416
<c.speaker>Because Javier took it.

21:01.416 --> 21:03.583
<c.speaker>That's why
the machine broke!

21:03.583 --> 21:05.708
<c.speaker>I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:05.708 --> 21:07.750
<c.speaker>I think you do.

21:07.750 --> 21:12.458
<c.speaker>Javier, you're suspended
from the observatory
project indefinitely.

21:12.458 --> 21:15.625
<c.speaker>What?! But I'm
the best student in this class!

21:17.958 --> 21:20.291
<c.speaker>Fine! I'll go!

21:20.291 --> 21:22.375
<c.speaker>But I'm keeping
the lab coat.

21:23.708 --> 21:25.083
<c.speaker>[door opens]

21:25.083 --> 21:26.416
<c.speaker>-You knew I'd come back
-[door closes]

21:26.416 --> 21:28.166
<c.speaker>if you said I could quit,
didn't you?

21:28.166 --> 21:30.458
<c.speaker>Well, I may not know
much about engineering,

21:30.458 --> 21:33.416
<c.speaker>but I do know
my little sister.

21:33.416 --> 21:35.708
<c.speaker>Hm. You ready
to go home?

21:35.708 --> 21:38.333
<c.speaker>Home?
Class isn't over yet.

21:38.333 --> 21:39.958
<c.speaker>Oh. Yep, got it.

21:39.958 --> 21:41.875
<c.speaker>You don't need me
to stick around anymore?

21:41.875 --> 21:44.166
<c.speaker>I'm okay.

21:44.166 --> 21:45.500
<c.speaker>Well, I guess I'll go.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.458
<c.speaker>Goodbye, Princess Elena!

21:48.458 --> 21:50.083
<c.speaker>I love you! [giggles]

21:50.083 --> 21:51.625
<c.speaker>All right, class.

21:51.625 --> 21:54.625
<c.speaker>Let's put those brilliant minds
back to work.

21:54.625 --> 21:58.500
<c.speaker>Open your Physics books
to page 49.

21:58.500 --> 22:02.208
<c.speaker>The conservation
of momentum.

22:03.625 --> 22:07.458
<c.speaker>[theme music playing]
