WEBVTT

00:05.919 --> 00:07.616
Another cold brew?

00:07.652 --> 00:10.155
Don't mind if I "cold do." Nailed it.

00:10.191 --> 00:12.293
I am loving this machine
that Charles brought in.

00:12.329 --> 00:15.536
It is nice. The trick is to let the
coffee warm up to room temperature.

00:15.572 --> 00:16.625
I'm already on my second cup.

00:16.668 --> 00:17.800
This is my third.

00:17.843 --> 00:20.063
Stop!

00:20.107 --> 00:22.631
You're drinking too much!

00:22.886 --> 00:25.280
Whoa, what's going on, Charles?
Why are you talking so slow?

00:25.316 --> 00:27.723
I'm not. I'm normal.

00:27.766 --> 00:30.378
We're all normal.

00:35.682 --> 00:37.266
If you're not going slow,
that means we're going fast.

00:37.302 --> 00:38.483
Are we going fast? Can anyone
tell if we're going fast?

00:38.519 --> 00:39.998
I don't think we're going fast
at all in any way whatsoever.

00:40.034 --> 00:41.353
I feel like we're going slow
in every way whatsoever.

00:41.389 --> 00:42.685
- Captain, how do you feel?
- Great. Excellent. Amazing.

00:42.721 --> 00:44.026
I feel better than
I've ever felt at any moment

00:44.062 --> 00:45.071
- in my entire life.
- So we're all fine?

00:45.107 --> 00:46.456
Yep.

01:09.636 --> 01:11.920
Hey there, Captain.
Oh, is this your new assistant?

01:11.956 --> 01:13.109
John Urblan. Nice to meet ya.

01:13.145 --> 01:14.836
And John Urblan has just been fired.

01:14.872 --> 01:15.855
- What?
- I have?

01:15.891 --> 01:17.721
Meet "ya"? You just abbreviated

01:17.757 --> 01:19.106
a one-syllable word.

01:19.142 --> 01:20.230
- Is this for real?
- Yes.

01:20.266 --> 01:21.774
Now clean out your "des."

01:22.429 --> 01:24.214
I removed the K so you'd understand

01:24.250 --> 01:26.252
how absurd "ya" sound.

01:26.288 --> 01:28.681
Oh, boy. Sorry, John Urblan. Bye.

01:28.974 --> 01:31.019
Okay, sir, so that is
the third assistant

01:31.055 --> 01:32.491
you've fired in three days.

01:32.527 --> 01:34.442
Because all the candidates are garbage.

01:34.478 --> 01:36.828
Microsoft Word is not a special skill,

01:36.864 --> 01:38.518
Marcie Lux from South Orange.

01:38.554 --> 01:40.687
Come on, look at the size
of that stack of résumés.

01:40.723 --> 01:42.203
There's got to be someone good.

01:42.239 --> 01:44.024
Oh, yes, perhaps I should
keep an open mind.

01:44.060 --> 01:46.802
Perhaps cross-country skiing
is a valuable skill

01:46.838 --> 01:49.841
in an office environment,
Marcie Lux of South Orange.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.531
Okay, so we can agree
Marcie Lux is out of the mix.

01:51.567 --> 01:52.703
Well, they all are.

01:52.739 --> 01:54.082
I'll just make do with no assistant.

01:54.118 --> 01:55.500
No, don't just give up.

01:55.536 --> 01:57.148
Maybe you haven't found
the right person yet.

01:57.302 --> 01:58.965
I found Gina. Maybe I could try.

01:59.001 --> 02:01.218
Okay. I suppose it's worth a shot.

02:01.254 --> 02:02.763
I can always fire whoever you choose.

02:02.799 --> 02:04.061
Yeah, that's the spirit.

02:04.097 --> 02:06.839
Commence Operation: Nasty.

02:06.875 --> 02:09.925
New Assistant Selection Team...

02:10.667 --> 02:11.794
You.

02:11.830 --> 02:13.583
Operation: New Assistant
Selection Team You?

02:13.626 --> 02:14.587
Yeah, don't worry about it.

02:14.623 --> 02:15.841
Everyone will just call it
Operation: Nasty.

02:15.877 --> 02:16.975
You don't have to turn everything

02:17.011 --> 02:18.404
into a Thomas Cruise film.

02:18.440 --> 02:19.658
Why not? Movies are super fun.

02:19.694 --> 02:21.163
Meanwhile, real life is very boring.

02:21.199 --> 02:22.555
That's why no one watches documentaries.

02:22.591 --> 02:23.940
Tell that to the man sitting next to me

02:23.976 --> 02:25.543
at last Saturday afternoon's screening

02:25.579 --> 02:28.215
of "Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda."

02:28.251 --> 02:29.465
Was that man Kevin?

02:30.893 --> 02:31.902
- Yes.
- All right,

02:31.938 --> 02:33.418
I'm gonna help you find a new assistant.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.326
Operation: Nasty is a go!

02:35.495 --> 02:37.018
Hey, can I talk to you guys?

02:37.054 --> 02:39.491
Ugh, you're not selling
those crapola candy bars

02:39.527 --> 02:41.198
for your daughters' doomed
basketball team again, are you?

02:41.234 --> 02:42.192
- Doomed?
- Yeah.

02:42.228 --> 02:44.329
- They're terrible and you know it.
- Well, I'm not selling candy.

02:45.008 --> 02:46.619
That's next week. Please bring cash.

02:46.655 --> 02:48.886
What I want to talk about
is how our office

02:48.922 --> 02:50.209
has turned into a junkyard.

02:50.245 --> 02:52.012
Yeah, you know, this place is a mess.

02:52.056 --> 02:53.647
I mean, it's like an episode
of "Hoarders."

02:53.683 --> 02:54.841
And not one of the funny ones,

02:54.885 --> 02:56.147
where they find a bunch of flat cats.

02:56.190 --> 02:59.106
The problem is, Commissioner Kelly
is never gonna reopen the first floor.

02:59.150 --> 03:00.541
We should just fire
some of the uniforms.

03:00.817 --> 03:02.558
But not you. Uh, we couldn't survive

03:02.594 --> 03:04.204
without you, Greg, and...

03:04.459 --> 03:05.417
also Greg?

03:05.460 --> 03:06.448
James and Michael.

03:06.484 --> 03:08.007
No one is getting fired.

03:08.043 --> 03:09.653
We just need to organize this place.

03:09.689 --> 03:12.169
Nah, do what I do. Embrace the mess.

03:12.244 --> 03:14.115
You've got a bagel
stuck to your sweater.

03:14.151 --> 03:15.935
Look, I don't want to sound
like a Scully here,

03:15.971 --> 03:17.581
but I think it's hopeless.

03:17.617 --> 03:19.469
Nobody could organize this place.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.397
- Nobody?
- Here's what I need.

03:21.433 --> 03:23.202
Sticky notes, three sizes, ten colors.

03:23.238 --> 03:24.718
Permanent markers, clickable only.

03:24.754 --> 03:25.973
I don't want caps slowing us down.

03:26.009 --> 03:27.794
And I need garbage bags, 33 gallon,

03:27.830 --> 03:28.902
blackout, cinch top.

03:29.390 --> 03:30.461
What are you all still doing here?

03:30.497 --> 03:31.829
Go, go, go!

03:32.621 --> 03:33.945
Captain Holt,

03:34.190 --> 03:36.584
I'd like to introduce you
to your new assistant.

03:36.620 --> 03:37.799
Drumroll, please.

03:42.509 --> 03:44.380
- That's your drumroll?
- When a tempo isn't specified,

03:44.416 --> 03:46.331
any reasonable person
would default to lento.

03:46.367 --> 03:48.407
Well, it's terrible,
and you ruined a fun thing,

03:48.443 --> 03:50.130
but I would still like to introduce you

03:50.166 --> 03:51.981
to Mr. Gordon Lundt!

03:53.871 --> 03:55.282
Mr. Gordon Lundt!

03:57.034 --> 03:58.144
Gordon, you want to come in here?

03:58.180 --> 03:59.406
Oh, I'm so sorry.

03:59.442 --> 04:01.437
I was just deciding whether
I should just go home.

04:01.473 --> 04:03.344
The tone and tenor of your introduction

04:03.388 --> 04:05.346
make me worry that this is
a "fun" office,

04:05.390 --> 04:06.957
which I would not enjoy.

04:07.000 --> 04:07.979
Ehh?

04:08.015 --> 04:09.582
Hello, I'm Captain Raymond Holt,

04:09.618 --> 04:12.185
and I can assure you,
this is not a fun office.

04:12.397 --> 04:13.540
Thank goodness.

04:13.576 --> 04:16.103
In that case, my interest is renewed.

04:16.140 --> 04:18.475
- Here is my résumé.
- Oh, I'm feeling this.

04:18.511 --> 04:19.990
Are you guys feeling this?
Gordon, why don't you

04:20.026 --> 04:21.636
tell Captain Holt
a little bit about yourself?

04:21.672 --> 04:23.935
Where to begin?
I'm 174 centimeters tall,

04:23.971 --> 04:25.756
I can type 103 words per minute

04:25.792 --> 04:28.203
with an error rate of 1.6%,

04:28.239 --> 04:30.008
and I recently moved here
from Philadelphia,

04:30.044 --> 04:32.053
which is the sixth
most populous U.S. city.

04:32.089 --> 04:33.395
I understand the city of Philadelphia

04:33.431 --> 04:35.346
is coterminous with Philadelphia County,

04:35.382 --> 04:38.474
making it the eighth-largest
metropolitan statistical area.

04:38.510 --> 04:40.468
Yeah, Philly's cool. Isn't it fun

04:40.512 --> 04:42.254
- just telling each other facts?
- Yes.

04:42.290 --> 04:44.211
Well, I think I have
all the information I need.

04:44.255 --> 04:45.256
Thank you for coming in, Mr. Lundt.

04:45.299 --> 04:46.119
My pleasure.

04:46.910 --> 04:48.240
So...

04:48.276 --> 04:50.742
looks like Operation: Nasty
is a full-on success, huh?

04:50.778 --> 04:53.299
You mean Operation: Nasty Sex Slut.

04:54.262 --> 04:55.334
Didn't you see him flirting with me?

04:55.370 --> 04:56.675
No, I most definitely did not.

04:56.711 --> 04:58.517
Then you're a blind man
and a prude to boot.

04:58.553 --> 04:59.989
Did you see his tie? A single Windsor.

05:00.025 --> 05:02.045
The easiest knot to undo.

05:02.081 --> 05:03.364
Why bother wearing any clothes at all?

05:03.400 --> 05:05.226
I think you badly misread
that interaction.

05:05.262 --> 05:07.873
Please. He did everything
but lick his lips and purr.

05:07.994 --> 05:09.082
Get rid of him, and bring me someone

05:09.118 --> 05:10.859
who can keep it in their slacks.

05:10.895 --> 05:12.331
Did someone say to take off our slacks?

05:12.367 --> 05:13.874
No, not even close.

05:13.910 --> 05:15.434
Oh. Well, keep me posted.

05:15.470 --> 05:16.580
My dogs are barkin'.

05:18.034 --> 05:19.431
What dogs?

05:20.183 --> 05:22.423
Okay, Marie Kondo came up with a system

05:22.467 --> 05:24.774
to unclutter your life.
You look at an object,

05:24.817 --> 05:26.029
and if it doesn't bring you joy,

05:26.065 --> 05:27.701
you throw it away. Try it, Sarge.

05:27.958 --> 05:29.474
Hello, backup pair of suspenders.

05:29.517 --> 05:30.647
Do you bring me joy?

05:30.683 --> 05:32.719
Yes, because you have tab endings

05:32.755 --> 05:34.060
and a sweet leather yoke.

05:34.096 --> 05:35.578
I'm so glad you're in my life.

05:35.824 --> 05:37.471
- I guess I'm keeping 'em.
- Ooh, let me try.

05:37.507 --> 05:39.812
Hello, bag of old dried mushrooms.

05:39.848 --> 05:41.937
Do you bring me joy? Yes!

05:41.973 --> 05:45.629
You provide rich, earthy flavor
to both soups and teas.

05:45.665 --> 05:47.580
I guess I'm keeping mine too.
This is fun.

05:47.616 --> 05:48.791
Guys, you can't keep everything.

05:48.827 --> 05:50.263
That defeats the purpose.

05:50.462 --> 05:52.726
I got this, Ames. Hello, unsolved case.

05:52.762 --> 05:53.963
Do you bring me joy?

05:54.047 --> 05:56.302
No, because you're boring
and you're too hard. See ya.

05:56.826 --> 05:58.761
Personal items only, Scully.

05:58.797 --> 06:00.233
Get that case out of the trash.

06:00.269 --> 06:01.965
Oh, for Pete's sake.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.857
Sir, we need to talk about Gordon Lundt,

06:04.901 --> 06:06.005
and before you ask,

06:06.041 --> 06:07.583
- I have not fired him.
- Yes, I noticed.

06:07.619 --> 06:09.664
He's been strutting around
like a peacock,

06:09.700 --> 06:11.615
trying desperately to arouse me,

06:11.651 --> 06:13.610
his unwilling peahen.

06:13.961 --> 06:15.484
Did you hear
there's a barrel-making exhibit

06:15.520 --> 06:16.839
at the Brooklyn Museum of Industry?

06:16.875 --> 06:17.858
Yes.

06:20.016 --> 06:21.801
Has he no shame? The door was open.

06:21.837 --> 06:23.187
I think he wanted people to hear.

06:23.223 --> 06:24.485
Yeah, well, I didn't fire him

06:24.529 --> 06:25.835
because I thought you were being crazy

06:25.878 --> 06:27.184
and I wanted to change your mind,

06:27.227 --> 06:28.872
so I called all the places
he used to work.

06:28.908 --> 06:30.412
You didn't do that
before you brought him in?

06:30.448 --> 06:31.971
What? No, you check references

06:32.015 --> 06:33.619
after there's a problem.
That's hiring 101.

06:33.655 --> 06:37.006
Anyways, it turns out he never
worked at the Philadelphia PD.

06:37.042 --> 06:40.045
So he's a liar and a hussy?
Why is he still here?

06:40.081 --> 06:42.779
Because I started thinking,
why would he lie?

06:42.815 --> 06:44.222
And the answer is:

06:44.588 --> 06:46.867
because he's a spy, planted here

06:46.903 --> 06:48.469
by Commissioner Kelly. Think about it.

06:48.505 --> 06:50.550
You've been rounding up all
the captains who oppose him.

06:50.586 --> 06:52.147
Kelly wants those names.

06:52.183 --> 06:54.141
Gordon was sent here to seduce you.

06:54.237 --> 06:56.108
- He's a red sparrow.
- You mean a honeypot.

06:56.144 --> 06:57.928
Potato, tomato, but yes.

06:57.964 --> 07:00.101
He is the world's most boring sex spy,

07:00.465 --> 07:02.306
and he's here to infiltrate
the Nine-Nine.

07:02.342 --> 07:03.490
No, this is just you

07:03.526 --> 07:05.143
still trying to make
everything into a movie.

07:05.179 --> 07:06.920
This is the real world, Peralta.

07:06.956 --> 07:08.591
There are no spies in our midst.

07:08.627 --> 07:11.021
I'm sure Gordon just lied
on his résumé to get a job.

07:11.057 --> 07:14.257
Oh, really? Then how come
he's in this old staff photo

07:14.755 --> 07:16.104
from the Three-Six?

07:16.140 --> 07:17.315
Kelly's old precinct?

07:17.625 --> 07:19.793
You're right. Gordon's a honeypot.

07:19.829 --> 07:20.882
Or a red sparrow.

07:20.918 --> 07:22.572
Buzz, buzz, little bee.

07:22.631 --> 07:23.850
Fly, bird, fly.

07:23.886 --> 07:25.061
- Buzz.
- Fly.

07:25.097 --> 07:26.141
- Buzz.
- Fly.

07:26.177 --> 07:28.788
- Buzz.
- Fly.

07:29.159 --> 07:31.248
The point is, we're on
the same page. He's a spy.

07:33.458 --> 07:35.142
Hey, Hitchcock.

07:35.178 --> 07:36.957
God, you scared me. I've got a razor.

07:36.993 --> 07:38.245
Sorry. I need the bathroom.

07:38.281 --> 07:39.961
Fine, but you're lucky
I didn't cut myself.

07:39.997 --> 07:41.825
Yep, sure am.

07:41.861 --> 07:43.515
Have a good one, buddy.

07:44.870 --> 07:46.081
- Any poopers?
- None.

07:46.117 --> 07:47.692
What is this? Why are we
meeting in the bathroom?

07:47.728 --> 07:49.243
Super cool meeting spot.

07:49.279 --> 07:51.412
Don't roll your eyes at me, Daria.

07:51.448 --> 07:53.320
Commissioner Kelly sent a spy
into our midst.

07:53.356 --> 07:55.315
This is happening.
We need to talk about our plan.

07:55.351 --> 07:57.495
Okay, here it is. I'm going to fire him.

07:57.531 --> 07:58.804
You can't do that.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.415
In a movie, when you find out
someone's a spy, you don't fire them.

08:01.451 --> 08:02.844
You can either have them murdered...

08:02.880 --> 08:04.751
- Not an option.
- Yeah, I know, we're cops.

08:04.787 --> 08:06.390
Blah, blah.
No one likes this side of you.

08:06.426 --> 08:08.194
Or we can launch
a counter-spying mission.

08:08.230 --> 08:09.927
I just want him out of the Nine-Nine.

08:09.963 --> 08:11.878
If we can prove that Kelly sent a spy

08:11.914 --> 08:14.134
into one of his own precincts
to seduce a captain,

08:14.170 --> 08:15.911
it's gonna look really bad for him.

08:15.947 --> 08:18.024
- And how will we prove that?
- With Operation: Dragon.

08:18.173 --> 08:21.130
Don't Reveal Anything,
Gordon's Our Nemesis.

08:21.994 --> 08:23.887
- No.
- I worked so hard on that acronym.

08:23.923 --> 08:25.998
You're not even going to acknowledge it?
All right, look,

08:26.042 --> 08:27.260
if Kelly's been communicating
with Gordon,

08:27.296 --> 08:28.605
there has to be evidence on his laptop.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.425
Yeah, but he doesn't leave
his computer unattended.

08:30.461 --> 08:32.794
It's always in his bag, which
he always has on his person.

08:32.831 --> 08:33.962
How do you know that?

08:34.006 --> 08:35.138
I've glanced at his work satchel.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.009
I'm married, but I'm still a man.

08:37.044 --> 08:38.784
Choosing to ignore that.
Now, if there were only

08:38.821 --> 08:41.070
some place where they make you
check your bag,

08:41.152 --> 08:44.460
like an airport, or even a museum?

08:44.667 --> 08:46.365
No. I couldn't.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.489
Couldn't you?

08:47.759 --> 08:49.021
Mr. Lundt, would you like to go

08:49.065 --> 08:50.373
to the barrel-making exhibit
this evening?

08:50.409 --> 08:52.416
Yes, Captain Holt.
I could make time for that.

08:54.070 --> 08:55.441
I need a shower.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.771
Okay, I went through my desk
and got rid of everything

08:59.814 --> 09:00.902
that didn't give me joy.

09:00.946 --> 09:02.034
You didn't get rid of anything.

09:02.070 --> 09:03.179
Because it all gives me joy.

09:03.215 --> 09:04.700
Picture of Nikolaj, joy.

09:04.736 --> 09:07.533
Cocktail napkin from my
first date with Genevieve, joy.

09:07.793 --> 09:09.969
Birthday card from my urologist, joy.

09:10.005 --> 09:11.659
He was the only doctor of my entire

09:11.695 --> 09:13.349
urethral support staff who remembered.

09:13.385 --> 09:15.953
All right, I don't think
Marie Kondo's gonna work here.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.555
We need something stronger.

09:18.157 --> 09:20.948
The Norwegian system: Munkensmat.

09:20.984 --> 09:22.594
It was designed by a radical group

09:22.630 --> 09:24.023
of Scandinavian organizers

09:24.059 --> 09:25.408
who are doing things with cubbies

09:25.444 --> 09:27.559
that would blow your minds.

09:27.595 --> 09:29.006
We need to Munkensmat.

09:29.042 --> 09:30.629
- "Munkensmat"?
- Sexy, right?

09:30.665 --> 09:33.827
In Munkensmat, you get rid
of all personal possessions

09:33.863 --> 09:35.932
- except one.
- I can't do that.

09:35.968 --> 09:37.404
What, I'm just supposed to get rid

09:37.440 --> 09:39.083
of my great-grandfather's shoes?

09:39.478 --> 09:41.698
He had one baby foot. This is cruel.

09:41.734 --> 09:44.545
Munkensmat isn't cruel. It's freeing.

09:44.581 --> 09:47.454
When you cling to these things,
you cling to the past,

09:47.490 --> 09:49.868
and you don't leave room
for new experiences.

09:49.904 --> 09:51.624
Okay, what one thing should I keep?

09:51.838 --> 09:53.578
Hatchet or Blu-ray of "The Intern"?

09:53.614 --> 09:54.877
You can always watch
"The Intern" online.

09:54.913 --> 09:56.219
Not the extras.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.872
There's a virtual tour
of Jules' kitchen.

09:57.916 --> 09:58.974
Monster.

09:59.010 --> 10:00.751
Well, Sarge, what's it gonna be,

10:00.787 --> 10:02.615
pictures of your kids
or those suspenders?

10:02.651 --> 10:04.479
Terry can't throw his family away,

10:04.515 --> 10:07.127
but these are nice suspenders.

10:07.163 --> 10:08.730
Are they special in some kind of way?

10:08.766 --> 10:10.725
Damn, Amy, I told you
about the leather yoke!

10:10.761 --> 10:12.678
Terry, you're clinging.

10:13.381 --> 10:15.470
- Munkensmat.
- My turn.

10:15.506 --> 10:16.812
It's between my seizure medication

10:16.848 --> 10:18.361
and this fidget spinner.

10:19.155 --> 10:20.604
I think I made the right call.

10:21.359 --> 10:23.496
Uh-oh. I forgot that it lit up.

10:24.460 --> 10:25.897
I've made a terrible mistake.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.164
_

10:28.207 --> 10:29.531
Look at that.

10:29.567 --> 10:31.384
They put the sherry barrels
right up front.

10:31.428 --> 10:34.057
Ugh. I hate it when museums
pander to the tourists.

10:34.093 --> 10:35.997
Oh, I think you need to check
your bag, Gordon.

10:36.041 --> 10:38.157
It's a small price to pay to make
sure the barrels are protected.

10:38.193 --> 10:39.579
My thoughts exactly.

10:40.393 --> 10:42.178
- The package is headed your way.
- Copy that.

10:42.221 --> 10:45.355
This better work.
I'm debasing myself out here.

10:45.398 --> 10:47.226
- What must people think?
- Relax.

10:47.270 --> 10:49.491
There's literally
no other people at this museum.

10:51.145 --> 10:54.238
Thank you very much. Here is $100.
Pleasure doing business with you.

10:54.274 --> 10:55.667
You know, you could have
just stolen the bag,

10:55.703 --> 10:56.704
and wouldn't have noticed or cared.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.481
Ugh. Be better, Yanya.

10:58.517 --> 11:00.092
- Okay.
- Yanya!

11:02.198 --> 11:04.025
Okay, sir, I am cloning the hard drive.

11:04.069 --> 11:05.810
You should only
have to distract him for...

11:05.853 --> 11:08.029
three hours? Good Lord.

11:08.073 --> 11:09.988
Do you think that you can talk
about barrels for three hours?

11:10.031 --> 11:11.105
Watch me.

11:11.229 --> 11:15.124
Ah, Gordon, take a gander
at this brine barrel from 1787.

11:15.167 --> 11:16.647
It looks to me like the work

11:16.690 --> 11:18.503
of master hooper Josiah Wooldruff,

11:18.539 --> 11:21.260
who learned the craft from
his father Jesiah Wooldruff,

11:21.304 --> 11:22.783
who in turn learned it from his.

11:22.827 --> 11:24.263
I'm already so bored.

11:24.307 --> 11:26.396
The slats are not flat. They're curved.

11:26.439 --> 11:28.224
The base of the barrel
is approximately 20...

11:28.267 --> 11:30.356
Every barrel is inspected before usage.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.621
The key is that the oak
was cured and shaped

11:32.657 --> 11:34.528
by Josiah's cousin Joshua,

11:34.564 --> 11:36.609
who was a cooper and not a hooper.

11:36.645 --> 11:38.560
Wait, are you still at the same barrel?

11:38.596 --> 11:40.033
Please move on to another one.

11:40.069 --> 11:41.636
There are so many barrels in there.

11:41.672 --> 11:43.825
You know what?
Let's look at that barrel.

11:43.861 --> 11:45.994
- Oh, thank God.
- It's a brine barrel as well.

11:46.030 --> 11:47.770
It was also made in the 1780s.

11:47.806 --> 11:50.156
In fact, it's identical
to the last barrel.

11:50.192 --> 11:51.976
Let's review why that's interesting.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.492
No!

11:54.528 --> 11:56.573
Having each selected our one item,

11:56.609 --> 11:58.698
we move on to stage two, cleansing.

11:58.734 --> 12:00.432
In Munkensmat, you don't just throw away

12:00.468 --> 12:01.643
your discarded belongings.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.223
- You incinerate them.
- What?

12:03.259 --> 12:04.738
Can't we just donate this stuff?

12:04.782 --> 12:06.158
So you can go to Goodwill after work

12:06.194 --> 12:08.256
and buy back those suspenders
you're so attached to?

12:08.855 --> 12:11.249
- No.
- Now, in true Munkensmat,

12:11.285 --> 12:13.399
you pile all of your belongings
on a raft,

12:13.443 --> 12:15.008
push it out to the icy sea,

12:15.044 --> 12:17.176
and set fire to it with a flaming arrow.

12:17.361 --> 12:19.319
But since we obviously
don't have an archer...

12:19.355 --> 12:21.452
I'm an archer.
I have like six bows in my car.

12:21.527 --> 12:22.528
Really?

12:25.694 --> 12:26.713
Launch.

12:30.895 --> 12:32.620
Oh, Munkensmat.

12:32.656 --> 12:33.744
Munkensmat.

12:33.780 --> 12:35.434
Munkensmat!

12:36.687 --> 12:38.428
Have you reviewed the
contents of Gordon's computer?

12:38.464 --> 12:39.552
Did you find anything?

12:39.588 --> 12:42.504
Uh, well, hem, haw...

12:42.813 --> 12:44.162
Are you literally saying
"hem" and "haw"?

12:44.198 --> 12:45.938
Look, I haven't found anything, okay?

12:45.974 --> 12:48.281
Not a single email
between Kelly and Gordon.

12:48.317 --> 12:50.841
So I whored myself out
at that museum for nothing.

12:50.877 --> 12:53.097
Not entirely for nothing.
You know? We had fun.

12:53.133 --> 12:55.614
Sneaking around, bribing
people, lying, stealing stuff.

12:55.650 --> 12:56.999
Coming home and having my husband ask me

12:57.035 --> 12:58.341
why I smelled like barrels?

12:58.377 --> 12:59.857
Seriously? What did you say?

12:59.893 --> 13:01.112
I told him everything. He understood,

13:01.148 --> 13:03.106
until I showed him a picture of Gordon.

13:03.142 --> 13:06.556
The thought of me at a museum
with that ten?

13:06.592 --> 13:08.193
He banished me to the guest room.

13:08.237 --> 13:09.499
Captain Holt, are you in there?

13:09.542 --> 13:11.152
Oh, no, it's him. What does he want?

13:11.196 --> 13:12.153
Do you think he knows something happened

13:12.197 --> 13:13.503
at the Barrel Museum?

13:13.546 --> 13:14.978
I wanted to talk to you about something

13:15.014 --> 13:16.102
that happened at the Barrel Museum.

13:16.138 --> 13:17.670
I think he knows. This is bad!

13:17.706 --> 13:19.910
Well, the longer we talk,
the more suspicious it seems.

13:19.946 --> 13:21.650
- Tell him to come in.
- Come in!

13:24.427 --> 13:26.429
Oh. I prefer to discuss
this matter in private.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.952
Anything you have to say
to me, you can say

13:27.995 --> 13:29.084
- in front of Peralta.
- Very well.

13:29.273 --> 13:30.622
I've been sent here to spy on you.

13:30.658 --> 13:33.138
What? I am truly shocked.

13:33.174 --> 13:34.567
We are both shocked.

13:34.611 --> 13:36.047
Commissioner Kelly
knows you're recruiting

13:36.090 --> 13:37.396
a team of captains to oppose him.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.849
He asked me to find out who they are.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.978
But I've decided I won't help him.

13:41.014 --> 13:42.451
- Why not?
- Because...

13:42.487 --> 13:43.962
I've fallen in love with you.

13:44.011 --> 13:45.657
What?

13:45.693 --> 13:47.782
That is truly shocking.

13:47.818 --> 13:49.294
For real this time. What?

13:51.160 --> 13:52.730
The plan was for me to
weaken your defenses

13:52.766 --> 13:54.030
with my brazen sexuality.

13:54.066 --> 13:55.372
I wouldn't say "brazen"

13:55.408 --> 13:56.845
so much as "completely undetectable."

13:56.881 --> 13:58.168
I couldn't have been more obvious.

13:58.204 --> 13:59.919
I wore a single Windsor knot.

13:59.955 --> 14:01.435
I might as well have a sign
around my neck

14:01.471 --> 14:02.777
that reads "DTF."

14:02.813 --> 14:04.387
"Desiring Thorough Fornication."

14:04.423 --> 14:05.383
- Nope.
- Exactly.

14:05.419 --> 14:06.420
- Oh.
- At first, the flirting

14:06.456 --> 14:07.600
was just part of the ruse.

14:07.644 --> 14:08.645
It meant nothing to me.

14:08.688 --> 14:10.333
But then the Barrel Museum.

14:10.690 --> 14:12.083
- I fell hard.
- Not surprising.

14:12.126 --> 14:13.867
It is an erotically charged atmosphere.

14:13.911 --> 14:15.124
The curve of the slats,

14:15.160 --> 14:17.075
the rivets, the bilge, the bunghole.

14:17.111 --> 14:19.008
Okay, I am actually starting
to hear the sex talk now.

14:19.044 --> 14:20.437
The bunghole is the least
erotic part of the barrel.

14:20.473 --> 14:21.909
- It's simply functional.
- Sure.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.330
Sure, sure, sure, sure.
Bunghole. Continue.

14:23.366 --> 14:25.194
Captain, I know nothing
could ever happen between us,

14:25.230 --> 14:27.685
but I care about you too much
to do Kelly's dirty work,

14:27.721 --> 14:29.244
which is why I'm tendering
my resignation.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.672
That's very honorable. I accept.

14:30.708 --> 14:32.927
Oh, no, you don't.
This could be our chance.

14:32.963 --> 14:35.574
We can turn Kelly's agent
into a double agent.

14:35.610 --> 14:37.394
Operation: Double Dragon.

14:37.430 --> 14:38.909
Oh, it's all starting to happen.

14:38.945 --> 14:41.774
I don't want to play
these movie spy games, Peralta.

14:41.810 --> 14:44.184
- It could backfire.
- Or it could front-fire.

14:44.220 --> 14:45.065
- What?
- It worked.

14:45.101 --> 14:46.660
Gordon, do you have any hard proof

14:46.696 --> 14:48.220
- that Kelly sent you here?
- Nothing in writing.

14:48.256 --> 14:49.431
We only communicate in person.

14:49.467 --> 14:50.903
Okay, so you call Kelly,

14:50.939 --> 14:52.724
arrange for a meeting,
then you wear a wire,

14:52.760 --> 14:54.545
and we have tape of the commissioner

14:54.581 --> 14:56.091
admitting that he's spying
on one of his captains.

14:56.127 --> 14:58.557
It could work, but I could never
put Gordon in that position.

14:58.593 --> 14:59.898
I would do anything for you,
Captain Holt.

14:59.934 --> 15:01.974
Thank you. And you can call me Raymond.

15:02.153 --> 15:03.589
Captain Raymond Holt.

15:03.625 --> 15:05.084
I don't think that's such a good idea.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.512
You're right, too much.

15:06.759 --> 15:07.760
That should never have happened.

15:07.796 --> 15:09.400
- Agreed.
- Wait, what?

15:09.436 --> 15:11.616
Did something just happen?
I've been standing here the whole time.

15:11.652 --> 15:12.839
What did I miss?

15:13.440 --> 15:14.534
What did I miss?

15:15.217 --> 15:16.495
What did I miss?

15:16.859 --> 15:18.932
Hey, can I take
a couple photos of your desk?

15:18.976 --> 15:20.978
I want to submit them
to "Organizers Quarterly."

15:21.021 --> 15:22.066
- What?
- There's a magazine

15:22.109 --> 15:23.530
- about organizing?
- Yeah.

15:23.566 --> 15:25.568
I want to be featured
as Organizer of the Month.

15:25.604 --> 15:27.171
Just imagine, me on the cover

15:27.207 --> 15:29.454
with tons of scarves lying around.

15:29.490 --> 15:31.013
I'm holding them up like,

15:31.049 --> 15:33.902
"This is too many scarves.
We got to do something!"

15:34.335 --> 15:35.394
Okay.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.778
Ooh, now can you open the drawers?

15:38.822 --> 15:40.171
If you want to get featured,
you got to show them

15:40.214 --> 15:41.651
what's under the skirt,
know what I mean?

15:41.694 --> 15:44.044
Uh, no, there are case files in here.

15:44.088 --> 15:46.177
I don't want any sensitive info
to get out.

15:46.220 --> 15:47.613
I'll blur the personal stuff.

15:47.657 --> 15:49.656
Come on, this is the money shot.

15:51.617 --> 15:52.923
Seriously, Terry?

15:52.966 --> 15:54.794
You didn't throw out the suspenders?

15:54.838 --> 15:56.704
What? That's not fair.

15:56.821 --> 15:59.146
I had to throw out Great
Grandpa Ellen's bitty shoe!

15:59.190 --> 16:01.061
Why are you even holding on to these?

16:01.105 --> 16:02.976
- I've never seen you wear them.
- I haven't.

16:03.020 --> 16:05.501
I saw them at the store, and
they're obviously way better

16:05.544 --> 16:06.582
than my normal suspenders.

16:06.618 --> 16:08.272
- Are they?
- Yeah!

16:08.308 --> 16:09.874
Tab endings, leather yoke.

16:09.910 --> 16:11.390
I can't keep describing them.

16:11.426 --> 16:13.891
- All right, calm down.
- I'm sorry.

16:14.209 --> 16:16.429
I bought them right before
I took the lieutenant's exam.

16:16.682 --> 16:19.043
I was gonna wear them on
my first day as a lieutenant,

16:19.079 --> 16:20.820
but then I failed the test.

16:20.864 --> 16:23.475
I thought I'd keep them
just in case I ever pass it,

16:23.519 --> 16:25.878
but I'll be honest.

16:26.324 --> 16:27.682
That's never gonna happen.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.315
I'll just throw them out.

16:30.586 --> 16:32.931
There. You can take your photo now.

16:38.636 --> 16:40.075
The deadline's tomorrow.

16:41.015 --> 16:42.539
We're just listening from afar.

16:42.575 --> 16:43.881
Do we really need to be in disguise?

16:43.917 --> 16:45.702
Yes, Carmine. Yes, we do.

16:45.738 --> 16:48.698
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Your cover is Carmine Frunch.

16:48.734 --> 16:50.475
You have emphysema, and your
best friend is your pet bird.

16:50.511 --> 16:52.077
I'm not sure I like this persona.

16:52.113 --> 16:53.810
Well, if you make it
too cool, it's not believable.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.761
By the way, my name is Jackson Fox.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.016
I'm an NBA player,

16:57.052 --> 16:58.489
and LeBron James is my best friend.

16:58.525 --> 16:59.688
Oh, here comes Kelly.

17:00.267 --> 17:02.084
So, Mr. Lundt. Good to see you.

17:02.269 --> 17:03.604
What's all this about?

17:03.640 --> 17:05.038
Captain Holt and the Nine-Nine.

17:05.082 --> 17:06.593
That's it, Gordon. Lure him in.

17:06.628 --> 17:08.414
He's plotting against you
with a group of captains.

17:08.450 --> 17:11.410
I'm only here because he asked
me to help him entrap you.

17:11.445 --> 17:13.665
- What is happening?
- He's triple-crossing us.

17:13.702 --> 17:15.748
Holt is listening in
from that surveillance vehicle.

17:15.784 --> 17:17.525
Hey, Gordon, can you still hear me?

17:17.560 --> 17:19.954
- Yes.
- You are blowing this, man!

17:22.380 --> 17:24.425
Oh, hi, Raymond. Good to see you.

17:24.462 --> 17:26.116
- Pull up a chair.
- Cut the crap.

17:26.152 --> 17:29.152
Stop masking your evil
with a candy cane smile.

17:29.188 --> 17:30.798
Ooh, I love candy canes.

17:30.834 --> 17:32.488
Everyone loves candy canes, John Kelly.

17:32.524 --> 17:33.960
Now admit you sent in
this boring bastard

17:33.996 --> 17:35.302
to honeypot Holt.

17:35.338 --> 17:36.557
It feels like you two are the spies

17:36.593 --> 17:38.769
based on your disguises, et cetera.

17:38.805 --> 17:40.981
Nuh-uh. This is who we actually are.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.544
A professional basketball player

17:42.580 --> 17:44.408
and a guy with a bird friend.

17:44.444 --> 17:46.402
Oh, it's not just about disguises.

17:46.438 --> 17:49.092
Everything that you recorded
on your wire

17:49.128 --> 17:52.697
clearly indicates that
I was the one being spied on.

17:52.733 --> 17:54.241
- Ow.
- Case closed.

17:54.277 --> 17:55.381
Pretty cool, huh?

17:55.417 --> 17:57.070
I can't wait to play that tape
for the mayor.

17:57.106 --> 17:58.882
You are gonna look so bad, Raymond.

17:58.918 --> 17:59.876
You're never gonna get
away with this, Kelly.

17:59.919 --> 18:01.112
Oh, I already have.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.584
Worked out better than I expected.

18:02.620 --> 18:05.013
I just sent Lundt in
to find out which captains

18:05.049 --> 18:07.181
you'd rallied against me,
and then you decided

18:07.217 --> 18:10.655
you wanted to bug
the commissioner of the NYPD.

18:10.691 --> 18:13.084
Somebody shot themselves in the foot.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.466
Hey, do me a favor.

18:14.502 --> 18:16.939
Put your resignation on my desk
in the morning.

18:16.975 --> 18:18.412
I'm so sorry, sir. This is all my fault.

18:18.448 --> 18:20.233
Operation: Double Dragon was a debacle.

18:20.269 --> 18:22.097
Yes, it was.

18:22.133 --> 18:25.833
If only someone had thought
to plan a backup operation.

18:26.110 --> 18:28.330
- Did you do something cool?
- I did something very cool.

18:28.366 --> 18:30.020
While I was banished to the guest room,

18:30.056 --> 18:31.666
I flipped across one
of those Thomas Cruise films

18:31.702 --> 18:34.371
on Home Box Office,
and I realized something.

18:34.407 --> 18:38.280
On a spy mission,
there's always another twist.

18:38.316 --> 18:39.836
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying I knew

18:39.872 --> 18:41.787
you would triple-cross our double-cross,

18:41.831 --> 18:44.616
so I planted a microphone
in the napkin holder.

18:44.660 --> 18:45.920
There's one in the flowerpot.

18:45.956 --> 18:48.001
Ketchup, mustard.
There are mics in both.

18:48.037 --> 18:49.560
- Where?
- In the tips.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.574
Oh, this is so great.
Where else are there mics?

18:51.610 --> 18:52.655
- Nowhere.
- Oh.

18:52.691 --> 18:55.389
But there are cameras!

18:55.425 --> 18:57.383
There's a camera, there's a camera,

18:57.419 --> 18:59.029
and there's a camera.

18:59.065 --> 19:00.857
I've got you on tape, Kelly.
You're screwed.

19:00.893 --> 19:02.852
The only thing that's gonna be
on your desk in the morning

19:02.895 --> 19:04.357
is a list of my demands.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.351
Operation: Triple Dragon is complete.

19:06.387 --> 19:08.867
- You named it.
- Not only did I name it,

19:08.903 --> 19:11.209
Triple Dragon is an acronym.

19:11.290 --> 19:12.683
Two Righteous Individuals

19:12.719 --> 19:14.828
Performing Law Enforcement
Directives Rapidly

19:14.864 --> 19:17.301
Against Gordon Our Nemesis.
Triple Dragon!

19:17.344 --> 19:18.867
This is the best thing
that's ever happened!

19:20.293 --> 19:21.887
I mean, not for you, obviously.

19:21.997 --> 19:23.355
It's bad for you.

19:23.912 --> 19:26.306
What is all this junk on my desk?

19:26.585 --> 19:28.250
It's not very Munkensmat.

19:28.286 --> 19:30.444
They're study materials
for the lieutenant's exam.

19:30.480 --> 19:31.568
You can't give up.

19:31.604 --> 19:32.664
You're gonna take the exam again,

19:32.708 --> 19:33.796
you're gonna ace it,

19:33.839 --> 19:35.493
and then you're gonna wear these.

19:35.536 --> 19:36.755
My lieutenant suspenders.

19:36.799 --> 19:38.040
You fished them out of the trash.

19:38.076 --> 19:40.121
No, they were covered in precinct goo,

19:40.157 --> 19:41.332
but I got you a new pair,

19:41.368 --> 19:42.916
- leather yoke and all.
- Aw.

19:42.952 --> 19:44.427
Some things are worth clinging to.

19:44.463 --> 19:45.420
I was wrong.

19:45.456 --> 19:46.631
Or Niles Bunkampf,

19:46.667 --> 19:48.713
the inventor of Munkensmat, was wrong.

19:48.749 --> 19:50.939
- Yeah, that guy's an idiot.
- Was an idiot.

19:51.133 --> 19:53.685
He got rid of all his objects,
including his clothes,

19:53.729 --> 19:54.904
and froze to death in a snowdrift.

19:54.947 --> 19:56.383
Why didn't you tell us that

19:56.427 --> 19:57.536
before we burned all our treasures?

19:57.572 --> 19:59.691
Eight framed photos of my dad,
up in flames.

19:59.735 --> 20:01.258
So does this mean we can start

20:01.301 --> 20:02.563
keeping personal objects
in the office again?

20:02.607 --> 20:04.466
Yes, on one condition.

20:04.502 --> 20:06.547
No one tells Bruce
from "Organizers Quarterly."

20:06.583 --> 20:09.150
I'm definitely not gonna
reach out to Bruce.

20:09.186 --> 20:10.970
Oh, thank you.

20:11.006 --> 20:12.224
You're a good friend.

20:12.349 --> 20:13.560
_

20:15.123 --> 20:16.882
Ah, good morning, Captain Holt.

20:16.926 --> 20:18.079
You're looking refreshed.

20:18.115 --> 20:20.030
Interesting. I didn't sleep a wink.

20:20.066 --> 20:23.112
Let's just say Kevin no longer
has me in the guest room.

20:23.148 --> 20:26.900
Nice. My two dads, straight smashin' it.

20:27.310 --> 20:29.460
Sorry, that came out weird.
Title of your sex tape.

20:29.503 --> 20:31.418
But more importantly, how did
it go with Commissioner Kelly?

20:31.462 --> 20:32.985
I gave him a list of my demands,

20:33.029 --> 20:35.172
and he's agreed to back off
of vigilant policing.

20:35.208 --> 20:37.123
- Whoa, that's amazing.
- But that's not all.

20:37.159 --> 20:38.858
I also got something for the precinct.

20:38.894 --> 20:40.880
Is it a fighter jet?
How did you get a fighter jet?

20:40.916 --> 20:42.240
We don't have the budget for that.

20:42.276 --> 20:43.582
- It's not a fighter jet.
- Aw.

20:43.618 --> 20:45.663
I got him to reopen the first floor.

20:48.908 --> 20:50.257
It's back to normal.

20:50.582 --> 20:51.844
It's beautiful.

20:52.091 --> 20:53.331
Thank you, sir.

20:53.367 --> 20:54.886
I couldn't have done it without you.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.922
As a matter of fact, I'd like
to take you out tonight

20:56.966 --> 20:57.923
for a thank-you dinner.

20:57.967 --> 20:59.263
Oh, I would love that,

20:59.299 --> 21:00.926
but I'm gonna have to take a rain check,

21:00.970 --> 21:02.536
'cause Amy and I already have plans.

21:02.580 --> 21:04.858
Although I'm pretty sure
you would approve.

21:05.322 --> 21:07.157
So this is a brine barrel.

21:07.193 --> 21:08.629
It's made by Josiah Wooldruff,

21:08.665 --> 21:11.798
who learned the craft from
his father Jesiah Wooldruff,

21:11.834 --> 21:13.444
who in turn learned... you know what?

21:13.480 --> 21:14.611
This was a terrible idea. I'm sorry.

21:14.647 --> 21:16.431
- Don't you dare stop.
- Oh.

21:16.467 --> 21:17.598
Okay.

21:17.634 --> 21:20.201
Josiah's cousin Joshua was a cooper,

21:20.237 --> 21:21.325
not a hooper.

21:21.361 --> 21:22.667
Oh, mama.
