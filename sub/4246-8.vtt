00:03.101 --> 00:04.735
<i>Reporting live from</i>
<i>Washington... Reed Wallace.</i>

00:05.970 --> 00:09.255
We have unconfirmed reports

00:09.290 --> 00:12.091
President Fitzgerald Grant's
birthday gala this evening.

00:12.142 --> 00:14.377
And early reports suggest...

00:14.411 --> 00:16.396
What?

00:16.430 --> 00:17.814
Where is the President?

00:17.848 --> 00:20.166
Why is he...

00:20.200 --> 00:22.201
I've just been told
that the President

00:22.236 --> 00:23.836
has gone to James Madison hospital.

00:23.871 --> 00:26.155
Why has he...

00:26.173 --> 00:28.258
Okay. I'm getting a
report now that confirms

00:28.292 --> 00:31.461
that President Grant
was not wounded.

00:31.495 --> 00:33.413
He <i>was</i> wounded?

Go!

01:14.036 --> 01:16.254
I'm fine. Stop! Get away from me!
Get away from me!

01:16.288 --> 01:18.556
- Ma'am...
- Where are my children?

01:20.359 --> 01:21.993
Ma'am,
I'd like to do an ultrasound.

01:22.044 --> 01:23.428
I am fine.

01:23.479 --> 01:24.712
Keep that clear!
Keep that clear!

01:24.730 --> 01:26.514
Someone shot my husband!

01:26.532 --> 01:28.249
You need to check on him!

01:29.851 --> 01:31.601
Charge at 300.
Charge.

01:31.636 --> 01:33.687
Clear.
I.V.'s blown.

01:33.721 --> 01:34.621
Clear.
We need the central line.

01:34.655 --> 01:36.056
Charging.

01:36.090 --> 01:37.541
Let's go, people.

01:37.676 --> 01:38.876
Mr. President! Mr. President!

01:38.910 --> 01:40.511
Look at me. <i>Look at me.</i>

01:40.545 --> 01:42.546
You may not die.
Do you hear me?

01:42.580 --> 01:44.565
You may <i>not</i> die,
so stay with me.

01:44.599 --> 01:46.417
Stay with me!

We need briefings
on security and defense.

02:00.598 --> 02:02.048
We need to raise
the threat level...

02:02.066 --> 02:04.351
Oh, my God. We need to suspend
the stock exchange.

02:04.385 --> 02:05.685
I don't know anything.

02:05.719 --> 02:08.071
I'm not... I'm not keeping
anything from you.

02:08.104 --> 02:09.656
I just...

02:09.690 --> 02:11.408
They're not
telling us anything.

02:11.442 --> 02:13.576
- Is the President alive?
- Edison.

02:13.611 --> 02:15.912
I'm sorry. It's just...
There's a lot of fear out here.

02:15.946 --> 02:17.597
- I have armed escorts.
- They're putting you in the bunker.

02:17.632 --> 02:19.049
Along with
the speaker of the house

02:19.100 --> 02:21.567
and the entire cabinet.
I'm sorry.

02:21.585 --> 02:24.337
You know I don't have a choice.
I have to go to the bunker,

02:24.372 --> 02:27.090
or else I'd... I'd be there
with you, Liv.

02:27.124 --> 02:28.708
I know how hard this must be
for you.

02:43.007 --> 02:44.508
I bought it at auction.

02:44.559 --> 02:46.510
President Eisenhower wore it
when he was in office.

02:46.561 --> 02:48.595
There are
only 48 stars on it.

02:48.629 --> 02:50.130
It's very rare.

02:50.148 --> 02:52.149
- You didn't have to.
- I know.

02:52.183 --> 02:53.400
It's your inauguration day.

02:53.434 --> 02:55.819
I wanted to give you
something special.

02:55.853 --> 02:57.237
You are
my something special.

02:57.271 --> 03:00.741
We said we'd stop
when you were President.

03:00.775 --> 03:03.626
Well, I'm not President
for another...

03:03.761 --> 03:06.478
- 23 minutes.
- Mm.

03:08.115 --> 03:10.734
Liv. I didn't know
you were here already.

03:10.785 --> 03:12.202
I just got here.

03:12.236 --> 03:14.404
Oh, isn't this the best day?

03:14.455 --> 03:16.373
Can you believe
this is happening?

03:16.407 --> 03:18.074
I read a biography
on Dolley Madison

03:18.125 --> 03:19.709
when I was 10
that I loved,

03:19.744 --> 03:21.995
and now I live in her house,
do her job.

03:22.029 --> 03:24.714
Ooh, Fitz, that's a nice pin.
Where'd you get it?

03:24.749 --> 03:27.000
It was Eisenhower's.

03:27.034 --> 03:29.085
Well, that's just...

03:29.136 --> 03:30.387
That is fantastic.

03:30.421 --> 03:33.256
You are wearing
Eisenhower's pin.

03:33.307 --> 03:34.841
The press is gonna love it.
Right, Liv?

03:34.876 --> 03:36.043
- Right.
- Oh.

03:36.477 --> 03:40.263
I, Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III,

03:40.298 --> 03:41.882
Do solemnly swear...

03:41.916 --> 03:44.334
I,
Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III,

03:44.368 --> 03:45.735
do solemnly swear...

03:45.787 --> 03:48.371
That I will faithfully
execute the office

03:48.406 --> 03:50.774
of President
of the United States...

03:50.808 --> 03:53.210
That I will faithfully
execute the office

03:53.244 --> 03:55.278
of President
of the United States...

03:55.313 --> 03:57.614
And will,
to the best of my ability...

03:57.648 --> 04:00.033
And will,
to the best of my ability...

04:00.067 --> 04:02.702
Preserve, protect,
and defend

04:02.737 --> 04:05.255
the constitution
of the United States.

04:05.306 --> 04:07.707
Preserve, protect,
and defend

04:07.725 --> 04:09.776
the constitution
of the United States.

04:09.811 --> 04:11.061
So help you God?

04:11.095 --> 04:12.813
So help me God.

04:12.847 --> 04:14.414
Congratulations,
Mr. President.

04:19.821 --> 04:20.887
Where do you want
to put the interns?

04:20.904 --> 04:22.355
I have all the speeches
from the campaign.

04:22.389 --> 04:25.242
Do you want to keep them handy,
or should I archive them?

04:25.276 --> 04:27.360
Did you bring dresses?

04:27.394 --> 04:29.029
- I'm sorry?
- For the inaugural balls tonight.

04:29.063 --> 04:30.413
You brought dresses, right?

04:30.448 --> 04:33.750
Uh, yes. But you're our boss,
and you're working,

04:33.784 --> 04:35.535
- so it's...
- Go.

04:35.569 --> 04:36.953
Go and put on your gowns
and have fun.

04:37.004 --> 04:38.338
Right now.
That's an order.

04:39.757 --> 04:40.757
Really?

04:40.791 --> 04:42.592
Really. Go.

04:44.795 --> 04:46.713
Um, thank you.

04:46.747 --> 04:48.381
You're...

04:48.415 --> 04:49.415
Thank you.

04:54.689 --> 04:57.607
You are literally... literally
standing me up for the ball.

04:57.642 --> 04:59.643
I can't take you
to the inaugural ball.

04:59.694 --> 05:01.311
You <i>knew</i>
that I couldn't take you.

05:01.362 --> 05:03.280
I am not like you.
I am traditional.

05:03.314 --> 05:05.565
I am not interested
in flaunting my secrets.

05:05.599 --> 05:08.218
I am not some dirty little
secret. I am your boyfriend!

05:08.252 --> 05:09.419
James, I love you,
but I'm already late.

05:09.453 --> 05:10.704
Can we have this
conversation another time?

05:10.738 --> 05:12.906
Or we could...
Just go!

05:14.375 --> 05:16.909
Hey, Liv.

05:17.444 --> 05:19.094
Cy.

05:19.129 --> 05:22.264
I was just filling in a reporter
on some inaugural ball details.

05:22.315 --> 05:23.449
Of course.

05:23.483 --> 05:25.351
I'm heading out to meet
the President and Mellie

05:25.385 --> 05:26.652
at the party ball.

05:26.686 --> 05:27.887
You want a ride?
I have a limo.

05:27.921 --> 05:29.538
I'm not gonna go.

05:29.573 --> 05:31.190
I hate dancing.

05:32.224 --> 05:33.541
Oh. All right.
I'll see you later.

05:33.592 --> 05:34.926
Mm-hmm.

05:44.203 --> 05:47.055
<i>♪</i>

06:14.249 --> 06:16.333
This is Olivia Pope.

06:34.801 --> 06:36.952
Hi.

06:36.986 --> 06:38.370
What are you doing here?

06:38.405 --> 06:41.340
It's my office.

06:41.391 --> 06:42.941
Not bad, huh?

06:42.976 --> 06:45.277
You're supposed to be
at the inaugural ball.

06:45.311 --> 06:47.329
I was
at <i>four</i> inaugural balls,

06:47.347 --> 06:50.983
and now I'm here...

06:51.517 --> 06:52.651
With you.

06:52.685 --> 06:55.003
Where's Mellie?

06:55.037 --> 06:58.006
Two floors
and a whole wing away.

07:03.344 --> 07:04.596
Mr. President.

07:04.630 --> 07:07.398
I like that.

07:07.433 --> 07:08.700
Say it again.

07:11.370 --> 07:13.021
Mr. President.

07:13.055 --> 07:14.022
Mm-hmm.

07:14.056 --> 07:15.857
We can't.

07:15.891 --> 07:17.158
- We can.
- Mm.

07:22.264 --> 07:25.200
Look around you.
Look where we are.

07:25.234 --> 07:27.819
This can't happen,
not anymore.

07:31.740 --> 07:35.627
I think it can happen
right there on that desk.

07:35.661 --> 07:36.978
No.

07:37.012 --> 07:38.062
No.

07:39.314 --> 07:41.848
We decided we have to stop.

07:41.882 --> 07:45.852
I spent
the whole night dancing,

07:45.887 --> 07:49.339
but never with the one person
I actually wanted to dance with.

08:12.245 --> 08:13.679
Mm. Stop.

08:13.713 --> 08:14.997
No.

08:15.031 --> 08:16.281
Stop. Stop.
No.

08:16.316 --> 08:18.817
Stop, Fitz. Fitz.

08:18.852 --> 08:20.085
Whew!

08:23.356 --> 08:25.424
We can't stop.

08:25.458 --> 08:27.509
I can't.

08:28.144 --> 08:31.613
You're the most important
person in my life.

08:33.732 --> 08:36.284
I can't just stop.

08:38.371 --> 08:39.971
Can you?

09:52.025 --> 09:53.225
♪

09:53.259 --> 09:54.560
The video we're showing
you here suggests

09:54.594 --> 09:57.495
that Grant sustained either
three or four bullet wounds.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.998
The doctors at
James Madison hospital

10:00.032 --> 10:02.817
have yet to release any specific
information about his condition,

10:02.852 --> 10:05.403
although we believe he is in surgery.

10:05.437 --> 10:07.205
The White House has to be,

10:07.239 --> 10:09.924
uh, I mean, it's not surprising
that they're remaining silent.

10:10.559 --> 10:12.243
The person making a statement
for the White House

10:12.277 --> 10:13.894
would normally be
the press secretary,

10:13.929 --> 10:15.212
but as I told you earlier...

10:15.247 --> 10:16.947
Press secretary Britta Kagen

10:16.965 --> 10:18.349
was one of those seriously injured...

10:18.383 --> 10:20.067
In the attack
on President Grant.

10:20.101 --> 10:22.486
No word yet on her condition.

10:22.520 --> 10:25.005
The magnitude
of what's going on...

10:25.040 --> 10:27.825
We can forgive them a moment
of chaos within this crisis.

10:28.759 --> 10:30.977
Of course,
there are protocols in place,

10:31.028 --> 10:33.847
the first being that
priority one for the country

10:33.898 --> 10:35.632
is securing the Vice President.

10:35.666 --> 10:36.883
Do we have any information

10:36.934 --> 10:39.669
on the location of Vice
President Sally Langston?

10:39.703 --> 10:41.788
We're going directly to the
Naval Observatory, ma'am.

10:41.822 --> 10:43.506
We're going to the South lawn
of the White House.

10:43.541 --> 10:45.558
We have strict orders to
escort you to the observatory.

10:45.593 --> 10:47.127
The pilot's a marine, correct?

10:47.161 --> 10:48.294
Yes, ma'am.

10:48.345 --> 10:50.163
I am the acting

of the White House.

10:54.268 --> 10:56.319
You are welcome
to catch a ride.

11:00.540 --> 11:05.544
<i>We must all join hands</i>

- Maybe she's wounded.

11:23.512 --> 11:25.214
Maybe that's why we
haven't heard from her.

11:25.247 --> 11:26.347
Did the news say she was wounded?

11:26.348 --> 11:27.733
- No.
- Then she's not wounded.

11:28.284 --> 11:30.552
- This is out of control.
- Did that just happen?

11:30.586 --> 11:31.886
Did she actually just land

11:31.920 --> 11:34.122
on the South lawn
of the White House?

11:34.156 --> 11:35.323
Where is she?
Is she in the oval?

11:35.341 --> 11:36.958
If she's in the oval...

11:40.429 --> 11:41.646
Are you the President?!

11:41.697 --> 11:42.781
No!
You're not!

11:42.832 --> 11:44.299
Why?
Because...

11:45.133 --> 11:46.934
I want the senior
communications staff gathered

11:46.952 --> 11:48.602
and ready to brief me

Does this mean...

12:04.736 --> 12:05.803
Are you...

12:05.837 --> 12:07.921
Back?
Yes.

12:07.939 --> 12:10.241

12:17.798 --> 12:19.632
The <i>President</i>

12:19.667 --> 12:22.185
The man has
a bullet in his head.

12:22.219 --> 12:24.220
The country needs leadership.

12:24.255 --> 12:25.972
- The world needs leadership.
- He may have a bullet in his head,

12:26.506 --> 12:27.440
but it's still his lawn, Sally.

12:27.474 --> 12:28.624
I am in charge now, and...

12:28.876 --> 12:30.126
No! You're not in charge!

12:30.160 --> 12:31.577
Have you read
the whole constitution,

12:31.611 --> 12:33.663
or did you stop in rapture
after the second amendment?

12:33.697 --> 12:36.015
I have had quite enough of this.

12:36.033 --> 12:38.284
Allow me to summarize
the 25th amendment for you.

12:38.318 --> 12:39.802
In the case of the removal
of the President from office

12:39.836 --> 12:41.771
or of his death
or resignation,

12:41.805 --> 12:44.290
the Vice President
shall become President.

12:44.324 --> 12:45.708
Since none of these things
have happened,

12:45.742 --> 12:47.743
the only way
you're President

12:47.794 --> 12:51.880
is if the President <i>himself</i>
signs power over to you,

12:51.915 --> 12:54.499
or you gather the
signatures of the cabinet.

12:54.534 --> 12:56.501
And that may have all been
a little confusing to you,

12:56.536 --> 12:57.886
so let me summarize further

12:57.937 --> 13:00.055
and tell you simply
that if the President dies,

13:00.106 --> 13:01.406
I'll call you.

13:01.441 --> 13:02.874
Until then, these men

13:02.909 --> 13:05.844
are going to take you to a
secure, undisclosed location.

13:05.878 --> 13:07.029
The hell they are.
I'm not going anywhere.

13:07.063 --> 13:09.197
By being where you are
not supposed to be,

13:09.232 --> 13:12.384
you are threatening the
security of this great nation.

13:12.418 --> 13:13.819
These men are under orders

13:13.853 --> 13:15.320
from the Department
of Homeland Security

13:15.354 --> 13:16.872
and the Secretary of Defense

13:16.923 --> 13:19.224
to take you
to a secure location.

13:19.242 --> 13:21.376
Now you can walk out,
or they can carry you out.

13:21.427 --> 13:24.545
And it makes no difference
to them, because guess what...

13:24.580 --> 13:26.598
They serve at the pleasure
of the President,

13:26.632 --> 13:28.166
and you...

13:28.201 --> 13:30.335
Are not the President.

13:30.869 --> 13:32.153
For the record...

13:32.888 --> 13:34.788
The honor and privilege
of being here,

13:34.823 --> 13:37.441
standing on such hallowed
ground, helping our President

13:37.476 --> 13:39.393
set his agenda
for his first hundred days...

13:39.427 --> 13:40.761
It never leaves me.

13:40.812 --> 13:42.313
I'm so grateful,
madam Vice President,

13:42.347 --> 13:44.648
because I'm gonna need your help
selling some big ideas.

13:44.666 --> 13:46.267
I'm looking forward to it.

13:46.301 --> 13:49.119
And I understand that part
of the first hundred days

13:49.154 --> 13:51.405
will now be nominating
a supreme court justice.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.841
That would be correct.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.726
Who knew this chance
would come so quickly?

13:55.761 --> 13:58.512
I know. It's so exciting.
I'll be giving you my names

13:58.563 --> 13:59.646
by the end of the week.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.014
Names?

14:01.048 --> 14:02.599
That was the deal when Sally
signed on to our campaign.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.468
I promised her first crack
at nominating a justice

14:04.502 --> 14:05.852
if a vacancy occurred.

14:11.125 --> 14:13.409
Thought perhaps you'd like to be
briefed on a few things, sir.

14:13.427 --> 14:14.961
I am not a runner.
I hate running.

14:15.096 --> 14:18.498
I'm only running so the leader
of China or Pakistan or whatever

14:18.549 --> 14:19.616
can see photos of me running

14:19.634 --> 14:21.050
and decide I'm too badass to pop.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.819
I thought you might want to know
where the cameras are, sir.

14:22.853 --> 14:24.654
Cameras?

14:24.689 --> 14:27.991
The surveillance cameras...
In the White House.

14:28.009 --> 14:29.643
There are cameras?

14:29.694 --> 14:31.127
Every morning, an agent reviews
the footage from those cameras

14:31.162 --> 14:33.580
and either erases or archives
that video depending on...

14:33.614 --> 14:35.215
- What you see?
- Yes, sir.

14:36.149 --> 14:38.467
And I take it there's a camera
in the oval office.

14:38.501 --> 14:39.785
- Yes, sir.
- And you reviewed

14:39.820 --> 14:41.403
the footage the morning
after the inaugural ball.

14:41.421 --> 14:43.155
I have not seen anything
worth archiving, sir,

14:43.190 --> 14:46.208
not on my shift. But it won't
always be on my shift.

14:46.243 --> 14:47.443
You understand, sir?

14:50.580 --> 14:52.664
What are my options?

14:52.715 --> 14:53.849
Sir?

14:53.883 --> 14:55.550
You just told me there are
surveillance cameras

14:55.584 --> 14:56.768
all over the White House.

14:56.803 --> 14:59.488
I'm asking where
aren't there cameras?

15:01.441 --> 15:03.709
The state of the union
address is about the future.

15:03.743 --> 15:06.011
It should be a showcase
of everything you believe.

15:06.045 --> 15:07.679
A comprehensive, nonpunitive
immigration policy

15:07.714 --> 15:09.181
<i>is</i> something I believe in.

15:09.215 --> 15:10.799
That can't be your highlight.
It's not strong enough to...

15:10.817 --> 15:12.300
It's what we ran on.

15:12.335 --> 15:16.038
Immigration is noble,
but it doesn't light a fire.

15:16.072 --> 15:17.372
If you can't see...

15:20.410 --> 15:22.194
We can't touch defense
or social issues.

15:22.245 --> 15:24.429
It might upset the base.
I'm just saying.

15:24.464 --> 15:26.448
And I'm saying
we need to be bold,

15:26.482 --> 15:29.116
look forward, make a statement
with lasting impact.

15:29.634 --> 15:31.302
Immigration policy

15:31.336 --> 15:34.255
will get us a generation
of voters, maybe two.

15:35.307 --> 15:38.642
Fitz, stop running
for President

15:38.677 --> 15:41.028
and start <i>being</i> President.

15:44.199 --> 15:46.850
Youth is the future.
Youth is the next generation.

15:46.885 --> 15:48.702
You get young people involved
in volunteering.

15:48.736 --> 15:50.320
You give them a stake
in the country's future...

15:50.355 --> 15:51.638
And a credit
towards college tuition,

15:51.673 --> 15:53.307
<i>and</i> you announce it
at the state of the union,

15:53.341 --> 15:55.792
and any member of congress who
doesn't stand and applaud you

15:55.843 --> 15:57.644
loses every parent
in their constituency.

15:57.662 --> 16:00.230
That is...

16:00.264 --> 16:01.581
That's gold.

16:04.118 --> 16:07.037
What is that smell?

16:07.088 --> 16:08.472
Fresh air,

16:08.506 --> 16:09.556
sunshine,

16:09.590 --> 16:11.375
the great outdoors.

16:11.409 --> 16:14.611
Fresh air makes me
very nervous.

16:14.645 --> 16:16.680
I'm an indoor person.

16:16.714 --> 16:21.501
That's what the person
I was dating says.

16:21.535 --> 16:22.635
<i>Said.</i>

16:24.438 --> 16:26.990
You should call James.

16:27.424 --> 16:29.325
I bet he misses you.

16:32.830 --> 16:35.665
Worst-kept secret
in Washington.

16:40.870 --> 16:42.821
I am a leader
of the republican party.

16:42.855 --> 16:44.389
It's complicated.

16:44.424 --> 16:47.809
It's not. You want to be
with the man you love.

16:47.860 --> 16:49.711
Be with him.

16:49.746 --> 16:51.646
I'm an indoor person,
Liv.

16:58.254 --> 16:59.888
Mellie, what are you...

17:00.239 --> 17:01.790
Surprise!

17:01.824 --> 17:03.574
Honestly, I had to come.

17:03.592 --> 17:05.242
The kids just left to go back
to boarding school,

17:05.278 --> 17:07.377
and I'm not used to being all
alone in the White House yet,

17:07.412 --> 17:09.547
so I just thought,
why not come up here,

17:09.580 --> 17:11.951
see how the state of the union
speech is going?

17:11.984 --> 17:13.285
It's going great.

17:13.486 --> 17:15.569
Yeah, I told Mellie our sessions
have been very productive.

17:15.621 --> 17:16.387
Yes.

17:17.022 --> 17:19.423
Well, I would love to hear
all about it over dinner,

17:19.441 --> 17:20.641
which is why
I'm at your door.

17:20.692 --> 17:22.310
Fitz said you wouldn't want
to have dinner,

17:22.361 --> 17:23.810
but I said,
of course you would.

17:23.862 --> 17:25.813
Of course.

17:38.670 --> 17:40.920
In a few moments, we're gonna
take you live to the White House

17:40.954 --> 17:42.522
where former White House
communications director

17:42.556 --> 17:44.907
Olivia Pope
will hold a briefing.

17:44.942 --> 17:46.742
Pope, of course, was
part of the storied team

17:46.777 --> 17:48.411
that ran President Grant's
election campaign.

17:48.445 --> 17:49.979
When she left
the administration,

17:50.613 --> 17:52.214
it was a move
that surprised many.

17:52.248 --> 17:54.783
The choice to hand the podium
to Pope is unusual,

17:54.818 --> 17:57.002
but I am told that there's been
a lot of chatter of support

17:57.036 --> 17:59.104
<i>for Pope's display of patriotism...</i>

17:59.139 --> 18:02.308
<i>In stepping up at this time</i>
<i>of extraordinary crisis.</i>

18:02.942 --> 18:04.626
President Grant is in surgery.

18:04.677 --> 18:06.295
His condition is described
as critical,

18:06.346 --> 18:07.679
as is the press secretary.

18:07.714 --> 18:10.065
The first lady was unharmed.

18:10.099 --> 18:11.950
Any further updates
about the medical condition

18:11.985 --> 18:13.836
of the President
and press secretary Britta Kagen

18:13.887 --> 18:16.054
will come from the chief
of surgery at the hospital,

18:16.072 --> 18:17.606
not from this podium.

18:17.657 --> 18:19.791
Specific questions
about the attack

18:19.825 --> 18:21.793
are being handled by the FBI.
Ashley.

18:22.027 --> 18:23.795
Is the Vice President
acting as President?

18:23.829 --> 18:25.563
The President is
still the President.

18:25.598 --> 18:26.981
There are reports the first lady
is being treated for...

18:27.032 --> 18:28.299
The first lady is
not being treated.

18:28.334 --> 18:29.634
Why haven't we seen her then?

18:29.668 --> 18:31.219
The first lady is staying
at the President's side.

18:31.253 --> 18:32.604
She was not harmed.

18:33.338 --> 18:34.872
The Vice President just landed
on the South lawn.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.474
Why isn't she briefing us
instead of you?

18:36.508 --> 18:38.009
<i>The Vice President</i>
<i>isn't briefing you</i>

18:38.043 --> 18:39.427
<i>because</i>
<i>our national security protocols</i>

18:39.461 --> 18:41.663
<i>demand that her safety</i>
<i>be secured above all.</i>

18:41.797 --> 18:43.714
- Where's Huck?
-I think he had a date.

18:43.749 --> 18:45.683
I wonder if he told her
he used to be a spy.

18:45.717 --> 18:47.235
<i>So the secret service</i>
<i>took her from the oval office</i>

18:47.269 --> 18:48.469
<i>and just threw her</i>
<i>in the basement?</i>

18:48.520 --> 18:49.871
<i>Nobody threw anybody</i>
<i>anywhere, Ashley.</i>

18:49.905 --> 18:51.773
If I'm ever shot, I want her
running the press conference.

18:51.807 --> 18:54.092
Makes you wonder why she ever
left the White House.

18:55.126 --> 18:56.610
<i>...And equipped with</i>
<i>state-of-the-art communications</i>

18:56.644 --> 18:57.894
<i>and a highly trained staff.</i>

18:59.597 --> 19:00.881
Livvie.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.851
I haven't seen you.

19:04.886 --> 19:06.169
I'm busy.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.688
I'm busy, too, however,
I'm not sending my aides

19:08.739 --> 19:10.607
to meetings
in an attempt to avoid you.

19:10.641 --> 19:11.992
I'm busy.

19:12.026 --> 19:13.376
Olivia, I miss you.

19:13.411 --> 19:15.462
You walked her
to my cabin door.

19:15.496 --> 19:16.847
I didn't have a choice.

19:16.881 --> 19:18.431
I don't know
what you expect.

19:18.466 --> 19:20.467
I don't want to be in this.
This is...

19:20.501 --> 19:22.652
- I am not this person.
- Look...

19:22.670 --> 19:24.604
I know this is difficult.

19:24.639 --> 19:25.839
Difficult? Are you...
Ahem.

19:27.275 --> 19:29.126
Somehow,
I've become this person who...

19:29.160 --> 19:30.343
I have no words.

19:30.378 --> 19:32.062
We are together.

19:32.396 --> 19:33.713
That's all that matters.

19:33.764 --> 19:35.981
Really? Because I'm feeling
a little, I don't know,

19:36.016 --> 19:38.134
Sally hemings/thomas Jefferson
about all this.

19:38.168 --> 19:39.185
I have to go.

19:39.236 --> 19:40.636
Livvie.

19:40.654 --> 19:43.472
I have to go.
I have a meeting with Cyrus.

19:45.926 --> 19:47.476
I'm afraid we're just
backed into a corner

19:47.510 --> 19:48.111
on this one, verna.

19:48.144 --> 19:49.444
When Sally signed
on to the campaign,

19:49.445 --> 19:51.580
- Fitz had to promise that...
- I don't care what he promised.

19:51.614 --> 19:53.732
Justice Williams has a year,
maybe two left in him, tops,

19:53.766 --> 19:56.234
before he retires, so we'll get
another shot at this.

19:56.269 --> 19:57.886
You're a slam dunk for
the next spot on the court,

19:57.904 --> 19:59.320
- but we can't just...
- Have you two lost your minds?

19:59.739 --> 20:01.723
I whored every ounce
of my integrity

20:01.757 --> 20:03.324
to get that man elected,

20:03.359 --> 20:05.760
and here you are,
sitting on mount Olympus,

20:05.795 --> 20:07.562
telling me to go be
a good mortal,

20:07.596 --> 20:10.231
and we'll send down some nectar
when we find the time.

20:10.266 --> 20:11.533
No, sir.

20:11.567 --> 20:13.251
No how.

20:13.302 --> 20:15.270
Make it happen.

20:18.607 --> 20:20.090
The Detroit teachers union
seems to have decided

20:20.142 --> 20:22.409
that now would be a good time
to go on strike.

20:22.444 --> 20:23.378
Kim jong-il is engaging

20:23.412 --> 20:25.563
in some fairly serious saber
rattling in the yellow sea,

20:25.597 --> 20:28.115
and there have been six more
allegations of sexual misconduct

20:28.149 --> 20:30.000
at the n.A.T.O. Base
in east Sudan.

20:30.035 --> 20:31.452
So it's an easy day.

20:31.486 --> 20:32.887
Oh, I also got a call
from some reporter

20:32.921 --> 20:34.888
about some kind of
voting irregularities in Ohio,

20:34.906 --> 20:36.991
- but it's nothing I can't handle.
- What was their name?

20:37.025 --> 20:39.543
Oh, Richard something.
I'll take care of it.

20:39.578 --> 20:42.179
No, I got it.
Give me his number.

20:48.786 --> 20:50.754
Huck, it's Olivia Pope.

20:50.805 --> 20:52.406
Can you do me a favor?

20:52.840 --> 20:54.524
Morris.

20:54.558 --> 20:55.542
Ms. Pope.

20:55.676 --> 20:57.309
- I gave him some funyuns...
- Thank you.

20:57.327 --> 20:58.411
But I couldn't let him
on the grounds.

20:58.429 --> 21:00.163
I understand. Huck?

21:01.865 --> 21:03.750
The reporter you asked about
got his information

21:03.784 --> 21:05.001
from a Jesse Tyler.

21:05.052 --> 21:06.869
He's an employee
of Cytron software

21:06.904 --> 21:08.487
in palo alto, California.

21:08.505 --> 21:10.423
Where have you been living?

21:10.441 --> 21:12.125
A halfway house
on 6th street.

21:12.159 --> 21:15.395
Huck, you live with me now.

21:15.429 --> 21:18.247
But some clippers, give yourself
a haircut, take a shower.

21:18.299 --> 21:20.300
- And, Huck?
- Yeah?

21:20.334 --> 21:22.935
Take that shower before you
touch anything in my apartment.

21:22.953 --> 21:24.671
Mm-hmm.

21:31.127 --> 21:33.578
A Jesse Tyler is
calling some reporter,

21:33.613 --> 21:35.947
hinting at voter fraud
in Ohio.

21:35.965 --> 21:38.133
That boy's proving to be
a right pain in my oysters.

21:38.167 --> 21:39.551
You know him.

21:39.585 --> 21:42.087
Been calling my office,
looking to shake me down.

21:42.121 --> 21:44.172
Appears he's trying
to call my bluff.

21:44.223 --> 21:45.157
You need to handle this.

21:45.191 --> 21:46.908
Don't you worry a bit
about it.

21:46.959 --> 21:50.195
Young Mr. Tyler's punching
way above his weight.

21:50.229 --> 21:51.530
I got this, darlin'.

21:59.020 --> 21:59.954
What's wrong?

22:01.273 --> 22:02.990
You pace in circles
when something's wrong.

22:03.024 --> 22:05.025
When you're just thinking,
it's back and forth,

22:05.060 --> 22:07.828
but when something's wrong...
Circles.

22:07.863 --> 22:10.698
Did you need something,
Mr. President?

22:10.732 --> 22:12.199
See, you used to sound sexy

22:12.234 --> 22:13.751
when you called me
"Mr. President."

22:13.785 --> 22:15.686
Now it just sounds like
I'm a gym teacher.

22:15.720 --> 22:17.020
Did you need something?

22:17.038 --> 22:18.372
The Sally hemings-
Thomas Jefferson comment

22:18.406 --> 22:21.058
- was below the belt.
- Because it's so untrue?

22:21.076 --> 22:22.243
You're playing the race card
on the fact

22:22.294 --> 22:24.011
that I'm in love with you?

22:24.045 --> 22:26.280
Come on. Don't belittle us.

22:26.331 --> 22:27.798
It's insulting
and beneath you

22:27.832 --> 22:30.834
and designed to drive me away.
I'm not going away.

22:30.868 --> 22:32.503
I don't have to
drive you away.

22:33.137 --> 22:34.070
You're married,
you have children,

22:34.105 --> 22:35.322
you're the leader
of the free world.

22:35.356 --> 22:37.307
You <i>are</i> away.
By definition, you're away.

22:37.341 --> 22:39.025
You're unavailable.

22:39.076 --> 22:40.460
So this is about Mellie?

22:40.495 --> 22:42.012
N-no! This is...

22:43.447 --> 22:48.568
I smile at her and I take off
my clothes for you.

22:48.603 --> 22:51.254
I wait for you.
I watch for you.

22:51.289 --> 22:53.223
My whole life is you.

22:53.257 --> 22:55.492
I can't breathe
because I'm waiting for you.

22:55.526 --> 22:59.162
You own me. You control me.
I-I belong to you. I...

22:59.180 --> 23:00.430
You own <i>me!</i>

23:00.464 --> 23:03.033
<i>You</i> control me.
I belong to <i>you.</i>

23:04.067 --> 23:05.418
You think I don't want to be
a better man?

23:05.452 --> 23:08.604
You think that I don't want to
dedicate myself to my marriage?

23:08.638 --> 23:10.089
You don't think
I want to be honorable,

23:10.123 --> 23:11.874
to be the man
that you voted for?

23:11.892 --> 23:14.026
I love you.
I'm in love with you.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.245
You're the love of my life.

23:16.279 --> 23:19.781
My every feeling is controlled
by the look on your face.

23:19.799 --> 23:23.085
I can't breathe without you.
I can't sleep without you.

23:23.119 --> 23:25.087
I wait for you.
I watch for you.

23:25.121 --> 23:27.256
I exist for you.

23:27.290 --> 23:29.258
If I could escape
all of this

23:29.292 --> 23:31.560
and run away with you...

23:33.730 --> 23:36.765
There's no Sally
or Thomas here.

23:36.799 --> 23:38.984
You're nobody's victim,
Liv.

23:39.019 --> 23:41.353
I belong to <i>you.</i>

23:41.404 --> 23:43.805
We're in this together.

23:58.518 --> 23:59.969
We're gonna be here
all night with you.

24:00.703 --> 24:02.521
Once again,

24:02.555 --> 24:04.506
some three hours ago,
President Grant was shot

24:04.540 --> 24:07.042
entering his birthday gala a...

24:07.076 --> 24:08.510
I'm being told right now

24:08.528 --> 24:11.079
that White House press secretary
Britta Kagen

24:11.114 --> 24:13.181
succumbed to her injuries
in surgery

24:13.216 --> 24:15.017
and was pronounced dead
only moments ago.

24:15.051 --> 24:17.169
Britta Kagen was 32 years old.

24:17.220 --> 24:19.571
She has 2 daughters,
ages 5 and 3.

24:19.605 --> 24:23.291
She started her career here
at BNC.

24:27.663 --> 24:29.129
Let's go to Vanessa Leone

24:29.147 --> 24:31.198
who's live at the vigil
in Lafayette Square.

24:36.488 --> 24:38.355
- You all right?
- They just let us out of the bunker.

24:38.389 --> 24:39.841
What the hell is going on
over there?

24:39.875 --> 24:40.858
What do you mean?

24:41.593 --> 24:42.809
The Vice President
is making a play.

24:42.827 --> 24:44.278
She spent the last two hours
lobbying cabinet members

24:44.312 --> 24:46.413
about signing over
the presidency to her.

24:46.431 --> 24:47.631
She <i>what?</i>

24:47.682 --> 24:49.366
All she needs is a majority...
Eight signatures,

24:49.400 --> 24:51.135
and she's home.
She's two away.

24:51.169 --> 24:53.554
Traitorous bastards. Jeannine,
get the cabinet in here.

24:53.588 --> 24:56.771
- The whole...
- Yes! The whole cabinet.

24:56.790 --> 24:57.824
Cyrus, there's another way.

24:58.643 --> 25:00.276
Sally set the narrative
that Fitz is dying,

25:00.311 --> 25:01.727
on top of which
there's all sorts of rumors

25:01.746 --> 25:04.080
about Mellie and the baby.
People are scared.

25:04.131 --> 25:05.982
There's only one person
who can turn this around,

25:06.033 --> 25:08.101
who can assure the public,
and stop Sally in her tracks.

25:13.175 --> 25:16.227
Mellie.

25:18.462 --> 25:19.462
Is he dead?

25:19.496 --> 25:20.796
What?

25:20.831 --> 25:21.964
They told me when they
took him into surgery

25:21.998 --> 25:23.733
there was a chance
he might die on the table.

25:23.767 --> 25:25.351
They seemed
kind of scared of me,

25:25.385 --> 25:26.852
so I thought
they'd ask you to come in

25:26.887 --> 25:29.088
and tell me that he was dead,
which would be...

25:29.122 --> 25:30.406
Is he?

25:30.457 --> 25:32.174
I don't...
I don't know anything. No.

25:33.610 --> 25:35.994
Mellie, I'm sorry, but I need
to talk to you a...

25:36.012 --> 25:38.013
<i>Don't</i> sit down next to me

25:38.048 --> 25:40.099
like we are friends.

25:41.668 --> 25:43.386
Sally Langston

25:43.420 --> 25:46.372
is knocking on the door
of the oval office.

25:47.306 --> 25:48.790
You need to make sure

25:48.824 --> 25:50.842
the American people don't open
the door and let her in.

25:56.382 --> 25:59.117
I'll need something to wear.

26:00.919 --> 26:02.920
Apparently,
everything is color-coded.

26:02.954 --> 26:04.455
There are tags
on each dress

26:04.489 --> 26:06.774
indicating the date
and the event.

26:06.808 --> 26:07.891
- Shoes have corr...
- Thank you.

26:07.909 --> 26:09.477
But there's more.

26:09.511 --> 26:10.694
Thank you.

26:59.443 --> 27:00.910
That's the constitution,

27:00.944 --> 27:02.812
the actual constitution.

27:08.117 --> 27:09.285
You want to touch it?

27:09.319 --> 27:10.619
I'm not touching it.

27:10.653 --> 27:11.921
- Touch it.
- No.

27:11.955 --> 27:13.689
There are, like, six people
in the last hundred years

27:13.723 --> 27:16.291
who touched the constitution.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.544
- Be the seventh.
- You be the seventh.

27:18.578 --> 27:20.479
I'm the sixth.
I touched it four seconds ago.

27:20.513 --> 27:21.647
You didn't wait for me.

27:21.681 --> 27:23.315
It's the constitution.

27:34.861 --> 27:37.096
Wow.

27:38.030 --> 27:40.248
Wow.

27:43.786 --> 27:45.603
"We the people."

27:45.637 --> 27:48.022
That's just...

27:49.958 --> 27:51.992
That's...

27:52.011 --> 27:53.544
Just...

27:56.849 --> 27:58.533
That's everything.

28:00.419 --> 28:03.621
It's a new world.

28:03.655 --> 28:05.123
It's a new world.

28:13.548 --> 28:15.649
I love you, too.

28:15.684 --> 28:19.436
I'm in love with you, too.

28:25.993 --> 28:27.911
So we're in this together?

28:31.232 --> 28:34.300
We're in this together.

29:58.029 --> 29:59.530
Let's talk about the first lady.

29:59.564 --> 30:03.200
If, God forbid,
her husband were to die,

30:03.234 --> 30:05.069
things would happen rapidly
for her.

30:05.203 --> 30:08.855
Jackie Kennedy was forced
to discuss housekeeping details

30:08.889 --> 30:11.391
with lady bird Johnson
four days after

30:11.425 --> 30:13.193
the assassination
of President Kennedy,

30:13.227 --> 30:14.410
and she was
out of the White House

30:14.445 --> 30:15.813
within two weeks of his death.

30:16.747 --> 30:20.950
One hopes that Mellie Grant,
pregnant with America's baby,

30:20.985 --> 30:23.470
would be afforded
a far different outcome.

30:23.504 --> 30:25.221
First of all, I'd like
to offer my condolences

30:25.272 --> 30:27.373
to the family of Britta Kagen.

30:27.408 --> 30:28.875
She served this country
honorably,

30:28.909 --> 30:32.462
and we all owe her
an enormous debt.

30:33.196 --> 30:35.631
I'd like to thank Hal Rimbeau,

30:35.682 --> 30:38.617
the secret service agent
who took a bullet last night

30:38.652 --> 30:42.221
but continues to stand watch
over my family.

30:42.255 --> 30:43.973
I would also like to thank

30:44.007 --> 30:47.860
those of you who have put
my husband in your prayers.

30:47.894 --> 30:50.563
Not only is my husband
a religious man,

30:51.097 --> 30:54.066
he's a man who believes
that hope has power.

30:54.100 --> 30:56.284
So...

30:56.319 --> 30:59.571
Having America pulling
for him...

31:01.758 --> 31:04.342
Well, that just means
the world to him.

31:04.376 --> 31:08.480
Now...
About my husband's health...

31:08.514 --> 31:10.248
There have been rumors...

31:10.266 --> 31:14.335
Rumors that are not only
hurtful to my family,

31:14.369 --> 31:16.003
they are hurtful
to this country,

31:16.038 --> 31:18.256
so let me put them to rest.

31:18.290 --> 31:20.858
America has a President...

31:20.892 --> 31:22.693
A living President,

31:22.728 --> 31:26.547
and his name is
Fitzgerald Grant.

31:26.582 --> 31:28.599
He hasn't given up on you,

31:28.633 --> 31:32.185
so please don't give up on him.

31:34.623 --> 31:36.173
Thank you.

31:37.509 --> 31:38.859
Get his good side,
gentlemen.

31:38.893 --> 31:39.977
Focus on her.
She's better-looking.

31:41.162 --> 31:43.630
- Oh, your flag pin.
- What?

31:43.681 --> 31:46.182
- Your flag pin's missing.
- Oh, I must have lost it somewhere.

31:54.391 --> 31:56.526
It's called 50/50.
You go out into the community

31:56.560 --> 31:58.577
for two years,
tutor inner-city kids,

31:58.628 --> 32:00.762
build homes, help with
environmental cleanup,

32:00.780 --> 32:01.964
work for next to nothing,

32:01.982 --> 32:04.050
and in return, we give you
money for college.

32:04.084 --> 32:05.317
And your boss proves once again

32:05.352 --> 32:06.886
that he's a conservative
in name only.

32:07.120 --> 32:08.087
We need you to help sell it.

32:08.088 --> 32:09.938
It's a boondoggle,

32:09.956 --> 32:11.323
but I'll sell it.

32:11.358 --> 32:12.024
Super.

32:12.159 --> 32:13.325
But let me remind you again

32:13.360 --> 32:15.677
that there is a vacancy
in the supreme court,

32:15.712 --> 32:17.079
and I've made my decision.

32:17.313 --> 32:19.381
My choice is
Bradley Hargrove.

32:19.415 --> 32:21.182
I want him trotted out
in grand style,

32:21.217 --> 32:24.586
confirmed by congress,
without so much as a scratch.

32:24.620 --> 32:27.539
I'll inform the President
of your choice.

32:27.573 --> 32:29.641
Glad to be a team player, Cyrus.

32:36.748 --> 32:39.167
Do I have to do it,
or can you?

32:39.201 --> 32:40.384
It has to be you.

32:42.137 --> 32:44.355
I need to talk to you
privately.

32:44.406 --> 32:46.257
No. We are not
getting back together.

32:46.291 --> 32:47.508
I want
to give you something.

32:47.543 --> 32:48.843
Besides the last year
of my life back?

32:48.877 --> 32:50.495
James.

32:50.529 --> 32:52.914
You won
what I'm giving you.

32:53.548 --> 32:54.832
A story?

32:54.866 --> 32:56.800
A name.

32:56.851 --> 32:58.685
A nomination. Come on.

33:00.388 --> 33:02.272
They're saying hargrove,
my nominee,

33:02.306 --> 33:04.257
- had a juvenile record.
- Well, does he?

33:04.309 --> 33:06.309
He was 15. It was
supposed to be sealed.

33:06.344 --> 33:07.911
We can counter this.
It's not too late.

33:07.945 --> 33:10.230
No supreme court nominee
recovers from a hit like this.

33:10.248 --> 33:11.832
Pay your maid
with the wrong checkbook,

33:11.866 --> 33:12.899
and you're toast.
But a criminal record?

33:12.933 --> 33:14.701
His nomination's
as good as dead...

33:14.719 --> 33:16.152
- Sally...
- And I think you killed it!

33:16.487 --> 33:19.689
I think you made promises
you never intended to keep

33:19.740 --> 33:20.740
because you needed me
on the ticket.

33:20.774 --> 33:22.058
Well, let me make a promise
to you.

33:22.092 --> 33:23.993
I am in this for me now!

33:25.644 --> 33:27.279
Based on the gaggle,
you can expect the usual

33:27.313 --> 33:28.547
"what'll be
in the state of the union?"

33:28.582 --> 33:30.049
And the S.C.O.T.U.S. put
Verna's name out there,

33:30.083 --> 33:31.617
so you'll get questions
about that.

33:31.635 --> 33:33.452
Oh, and you may get asked about
this explosion in California.

33:33.470 --> 33:34.687
What explosion?

33:34.721 --> 33:36.222
In Palo Alto,
a software company blew up.

33:36.256 --> 33:38.057
- Seven people killed.
- Terror connection?

33:38.091 --> 33:39.925
Uh, too soon to say.
Could be an angry girlfriend.

33:39.943 --> 33:42.995
Anyway, the company's name
is Cytron, if it comes up.

33:48.168 --> 33:50.636
What did you do?
Did you blow up that office?

33:50.670 --> 33:52.354
Did you kill seven people?

33:52.389 --> 33:54.723
You said to take care of it.
I took care of it.

33:54.758 --> 33:57.042
I didn't say to commit
cold-blooded murder.

33:57.076 --> 33:59.111
We all done what we done.

33:59.145 --> 34:01.063
Can't get your cherry back.

34:02.582 --> 34:04.533
Seven people.

34:04.567 --> 34:06.018
Collateral damage.

34:06.052 --> 34:09.370
Jesse Tyler could've ended
this presidency before it began.

34:09.405 --> 34:11.688
We're in this thing.

34:11.724 --> 34:13.958
There's no turning away
if things get a tad messy.

34:13.993 --> 34:16.226
You don't get that,

34:16.262 --> 34:18.346
you're living in a fantasy.

34:30.813 --> 34:32.331
He came through the surgery
well.

34:32.849 --> 34:34.466
We were able to remove
all three bullets,

34:34.484 --> 34:36.534
and his intracranial pressure
is coming down,

34:36.570 --> 34:38.454
but he's still unresponsive.

34:38.487 --> 34:41.123
Okay.
So what do we do now?

34:41.158 --> 34:42.425
We wait.

34:42.458 --> 34:43.359
How long?

34:43.393 --> 34:44.627
We don't know.

34:44.661 --> 34:46.946
Truthfully, it could be a day.
It could be a week.

34:46.980 --> 34:48.313
You have got to give me
something more, Dr. Carroll.

34:48.348 --> 34:50.666
You have got to,
because "I don't know"

34:50.699 --> 34:54.320
is not an acceptable answer.

34:54.353 --> 34:58.157
There was a lot of damage,
Mrs. Grant.

34:59.275 --> 35:02.126
At this point,
he's lucky to be alive.

35:08.417 --> 35:10.117
Even with
the cabinet members' votes,

35:10.152 --> 35:11.535
there might still be a way
to avoid this.

35:11.569 --> 35:13.938
Cyrus. We find any
technicalities, even small ones,

35:14.005 --> 35:15.406
exploit them to their fullest.

35:15.440 --> 35:18.109
Cyrus, stop!

35:18.143 --> 35:19.076
It's over.

35:22.197 --> 35:24.865
Oh. Excuse me.

35:24.900 --> 35:25.800
Sorry.
We're celebrating.

35:26.534 --> 35:27.551
What's the occasion?

35:27.585 --> 35:28.635
I-I...

35:28.669 --> 35:30.203
He asked me to marry
him, and I said yes.

35:30.238 --> 35:31.955
And we're gonna have
a wedding and a baby

35:31.989 --> 35:33.724
- and a house in Georgetown
with a garden. - Eh.

35:33.858 --> 35:36.093
Oh, do you need
to talk to him?

35:36.127 --> 35:37.894
Because I'm engaged.
I could go plan things.

35:37.928 --> 35:39.729
Okay.

35:44.385 --> 35:46.019
What is it?

35:46.853 --> 35:49.521
That explosion in California...
Cytron...

35:49.556 --> 35:51.240
That was Hollis.

35:56.196 --> 35:57.596
Thought it might be.

35:57.631 --> 36:00.182
He killed seven people, Cy,

36:00.216 --> 36:02.167
and he's setting some
poor innocent girl up for it.

36:02.202 --> 36:04.219
Her name's Lindsay Dwyer.

36:04.237 --> 36:05.721
How shall we handle this?
What'll we do?

36:05.755 --> 36:07.489
There isn't anything
we <i>can</i> do.

36:07.524 --> 36:09.208
What? There's always
something we can do.

36:09.442 --> 36:12.210
Olivia, we're an hour and a half
from the state of the union.

36:12.244 --> 36:14.395
We're an hour and a half
from giving kids

36:14.413 --> 36:15.780
a chance to go to college,

36:15.815 --> 36:18.032
an hour and a half from changing
this nation for the better,

36:18.066 --> 36:20.752
so what exactly would you have
us do? Expose what we did?

36:20.786 --> 36:22.036
Have Fitz resign?

36:22.154 --> 36:23.221
Make Sally Langston

36:23.255 --> 36:24.489
the President
of the United States?

36:25.641 --> 36:28.009
Hollis is
a dangerous person.

36:28.027 --> 36:31.079
We won.
Hollis isn't a threat to us.

36:31.113 --> 36:32.563
No one's a threat to us,

36:32.598 --> 36:34.382
because we <i>won.</i>

36:35.016 --> 36:38.252
And it is sad what happened
to those seven people,

36:38.286 --> 36:39.653
it is heartbreaking,

36:39.671 --> 36:41.822
but they gave their lives
in service to their country.

36:41.856 --> 36:43.357
Lindsay dwyer
will give up her freedom

36:43.391 --> 36:44.825
in service to her country,

36:44.859 --> 36:46.493
and that makes them
American heroes.

36:46.527 --> 36:48.695
That makes them patriots.

36:48.730 --> 36:51.898
And the best way that I can
honor their sacrifice

36:51.916 --> 36:53.367
is to move on.

36:53.401 --> 36:54.902
Buckle down.

36:58.272 --> 37:00.390
Liv, how are you?

37:00.441 --> 37:02.041
Excited for the state
of the union speech tonight?

37:02.076 --> 37:03.976
- Yes.
- I'm excited, too.

37:03.994 --> 37:05.495
I read a final draft
of the speech.

37:05.529 --> 37:06.713
You and Fitz
did an amazing job.

37:06.747 --> 37:08.081
Thank you, Mrs. Grant.

37:08.115 --> 37:10.416
Well, I have something
of yours.

37:10.451 --> 37:11.985
The secret service found it.
You know Hal, right?

37:12.019 --> 37:13.319
He's on p.O.T.U.S. Detail.

37:13.354 --> 37:14.604
He found it the night
the President went

37:14.638 --> 37:16.272
to the national archives
to view the constitution,

37:16.307 --> 37:17.957
which surprised me,
because...

37:17.992 --> 37:20.160
If he'd gone to
the national archives to view

37:20.194 --> 37:21.761
the original constitution
of the United States,

37:21.796 --> 37:26.132
he would've invited his wife,
but Hal said you were there.

37:26.967 --> 37:27.967
So...

37:29.869 --> 37:31.070
Mellie, I...

37:31.104 --> 37:35.107
We all want the same thing.
You and me, Cyrus...

37:35.141 --> 37:36.592
We are a team.

37:36.643 --> 37:38.877
We got him
in the White House,

37:38.912 --> 37:41.347
and we are going
to keep him here.

37:41.381 --> 37:43.449
We are doing
our patriotic duty,

37:43.483 --> 37:44.550
serving our country,

37:44.584 --> 37:46.619
working
for the greater good.

37:46.653 --> 37:49.421
We just...

37:50.039 --> 37:51.673
Go about it differently,

37:51.707 --> 37:53.124
I suppose.

37:58.814 --> 38:02.117
You'll make sure
Fitz gets this?

38:03.736 --> 38:05.153
Yes.

38:05.187 --> 38:08.290
Thank you, Olivia.

38:12.344 --> 38:16.097
We gather this evening with
a new mandate for America.

38:16.131 --> 38:18.783
<i>The American people</i>
<i>have made it clear</i>

38:18.817 --> 38:22.236
<i>that they want an end</i>
<i>to partisan rancor,</i>

38:23.171 --> 38:25.188
<i>and every new President</i>
<i>stands here</i>

38:25.223 --> 38:27.624
<i>vowing that things</i>
<i>will be different,</i>

38:27.658 --> 38:29.960
and nothing changes,

38:29.994 --> 38:32.429
so listen to me carefully now.

38:32.463 --> 38:34.714
This time <i>will</i> be different.

38:38.486 --> 38:42.789
<i>I dedicate this presidency</i>
<i>to bringing integrity back,</i>

38:42.840 --> 38:44.925
<i>responsibility back,</i>

38:44.976 --> 38:47.110
<i>governing back.</i>

38:47.144 --> 38:49.613
<i>And I will remind</i>
<i>both my own party</i>

38:50.147 --> 38:52.282
<i>and those across the aisle</i>
<i>every day,</i>

38:52.416 --> 38:54.951
<i>that we have the sworn duty,</i>

38:54.985 --> 38:58.471
<i>the sacred obligation to not</i>
<i>just pay lip service,</i>

38:58.522 --> 39:04.010
<i>but to actually, finally,</i>
<i>and definitively do better.</i>

39:09.883 --> 39:13.703
And so I leave you
with this pledge.

39:13.737 --> 39:17.590
At this time, in this place,

39:17.624 --> 39:19.642
with this presidency,

39:19.676 --> 39:24.397
it... will... be... different.

40:04.752 --> 40:07.955
I, Sally Margaret Langston,
do solemnly swear...

40:07.989 --> 40:10.557
<i>President Sally Langston</i>
<i>makes history today</i>

40:10.592 --> 40:12.743
<i>as not only the first President</i>
<i>to take office</i>

40:12.794 --> 40:14.578
<i>under section 4</i>
<i>of the 25th amendment,</i>

40:14.629 --> 40:18.799
<i>but also as the first female</i>
<i>commander in chief.</i>

40:18.833 --> 40:20.534
And will,
to the best of my ability...

40:20.668 --> 40:23.102
And will, to the best
of my ability...

40:23.120 --> 40:24.021
<i>The President remains in...</i>

40:24.555 --> 40:26.072
<i>And I call him "President"</i>

40:26.090 --> 40:28.558
<i>because technically, he is</i>
<i>still President as well...</i>

40:28.609 --> 40:30.860
<i>President Grant remains</i>
<i>in critical condition.</i>

40:30.895 --> 40:33.513
<i>There is no more information</i>
<i>on his status at this time.</i>

40:33.547 --> 40:35.031
So help you God?

40:35.082 --> 40:37.066
So help me God.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.301
Congratulations,
madam President.

40:38.335 --> 40:39.469
Thank you.

40:39.503 --> 40:41.871
<i>All we can do as a nation</i>
<i>is pray.</i>

41:04.710 --> 41:05.860
<i>The FBI is issuing</i>

41:05.895 --> 41:07.778
what's called a high alert,

41:07.796 --> 41:10.815
and they... they do have
a description of a suspect.

41:10.849 --> 41:12.951
The suspect is dark-haired,

41:12.985 --> 41:14.786
average height and build,

41:14.820 --> 41:17.355
possibly with a buzz cut,

41:17.389 --> 41:19.724
<i>seen entering</i>
<i>the Stanworth Hotel</i>

41:19.742 --> 41:22.994
<i>wearing a red hoodie.</i>

41:23.012 --> 41:24.963
<i>This is</i>
<i>America's most wanted man.</i>

41:24.997 --> 41:27.098
Average height, average build,
wearing a red hoodie...

41:27.132 --> 41:28.600
In Washington, D.C.,
home of the Redskins,

41:28.634 --> 41:30.701
that narrows it down
to about 100,000 people.

41:30.719 --> 41:32.003
Don't.

41:32.737 --> 41:34.071
<i>We're gonna be here all night</i>
<i>with you.</i>

41:34.105 --> 41:36.724
<i>Once again,</i>
<i>at 8:05 Eastern standard time,</i>

41:36.758 --> 41:38.242
<i>some 14 hours ago,</i>

41:38.277 --> 41:40.978
<i>President Grant was shot</i>
<i>entering his birthday gala.</i>
