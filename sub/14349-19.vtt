00:07.931 --> 00:09.796
You'll enjoy Commodore Travers.

00:09.866 --> 00:12.699
He sets a good table.

00:12.769 --> 00:16.296
I wonder if he brought his personal
chef with him to Cestus III.

00:16.373 --> 00:19.274
Probably.
Rank hath its privileges.

00:19.342 --> 00:23.108
- How well we both know that, huh?
- [Intercom Whistles]

00:23.180 --> 00:25.842
Scotty. Kirk here.

00:25.916 --> 00:27.474
Travers,Jim. We're waiting.

00:27.551 --> 00:29.143
Good, Commodore.
We're on our way.

00:29.219 --> 00:31.187
Besure to bring along
your tactical people.

00:31.254 --> 00:33.085
I've got an interesting
problem forthem.

00:33.156 --> 00:35.488
We'll beam down immediately,
Commodore. Kirk out.

00:35.559 --> 00:39.893
Captain, I wonder why he's insistent
that our tactical aides come down.

00:39.963 --> 00:44.400
His colony is isolated, exposed,
out on the edge of now here.

00:44.467 --> 00:46.992
He probably wants
additional advice.

00:47.070 --> 00:50.403
- Perhaps, but never the less--
- Spock, isn't it enough...

00:50.473 --> 00:52.941
the commodore is famous
for his hospitality?

00:53.009 --> 00:55.978
I, for one, could use
a good nonreconstituted meal.

00:56.046 --> 00:58.276
Doctor, you are a sensualist.

00:58.348 --> 01:00.316
You bet your
pointed ears I am.

01:00.383 --> 01:02.510
Ready whenever
you are, Captain.

01:09.392 --> 01:10.324
Energize.

01:27.911 --> 01:30.436
Kirk to Enterprise, red alert.

01:30.513 --> 01:33.448
- What is it, Captain?
- Cestus III has been destroyed.

01:44.928 --> 01:48.864
Space--
the final frontier.

01:48.932 --> 01:52.368
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

01:52.435 --> 01:53.925
Its five-year mission--

01:54.004 --> 01:57.371
to explore
strange new worlds...

01:57.440 --> 02:00.671
to seek out new life
and new civilizations...

02:00.744 --> 02:04.805
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.

02:37.881 --> 02:39.644
Full alert.

02:39.716 --> 02:42.947
Tricorder readings, Mr. Spock:
life detection.

02:43.019 --> 02:44.748
Those messages we got, Captain,

02:44.821 --> 02:46.288
the one directing
us here yesterday--

02:46.356 --> 02:49.325
Faked. All this happened
several days ago.

02:49.392 --> 02:51.826
Lang, over there.
Look for survivors.

02:51.895 --> 02:53.795
Kelowitz, that way.

02:55.031 --> 02:56.464
O'Herlihy, stick with me.

02:56.533 --> 02:57.966
Captain, impulses that direction--

02:58.034 --> 03:00.468
Very weak,
possibly a survivor.

03:00.537 --> 03:01.902
Come on, Bones.

03:01.971 --> 03:06.431
Captain's log,
Stardate 3045.6--

03:06.509 --> 03:08.204
The Enterprise
has responded to a call

03:08.278 --> 03:11.611
from Earth observation
outpost on Cestus III.

03:11.681 --> 03:12.875
On landing,
we have discovered

03:12.949 --> 03:14.780
that the outpost
has been destroyed.

03:14.851 --> 03:16.785
Captain, over there.

03:26.496 --> 03:28.430
Careful, careful.

03:29.999 --> 03:34.629
Shock, radiation burns,
internal injuries for certain.

03:34.704 --> 03:36.228
- He's in a bad way, Captain.
- Keep him alive, Bones.

03:36.306 --> 03:38.399
I want to know what's
been happening here.

03:38.475 --> 03:41.638
Getting another
life reading, Captain.

03:42.846 --> 03:43.778
Survivors?

03:43.847 --> 03:47.544
Not survivors--
not warmblooded.

03:47.617 --> 03:50.586
Living creatures,
but not human.

03:53.022 --> 03:54.114
Where?

03:57.026 --> 03:59.460
Azimuth 93 degrees,

03:59.529 --> 04:02.396
range 1,570 yards.

04:03.967 --> 04:04.899
O'Herlihy.

04:11.207 --> 04:12.640
Captain, I see something.

04:14.310 --> 04:16.244
[Shell Falls]

04:16.312 --> 04:17.244
[Explosion]

04:17.313 --> 04:18.245
[Shell Falls]

04:18.314 --> 04:19.245
O'Herlihy!

04:20.483 --> 04:22.280
[Explosion]

04:22.352 --> 04:25.378
Kirk to Enterprise,
lock on transporters. Beam us up.

04:25.455 --> 04:28.424
Captain,
we're coming under attack--

04:28.491 --> 04:30.425
Unidentified ship
quartering in.

04:30.493 --> 04:31.926
We can't beam you up.

04:31.995 --> 04:33.929
I've just rigged up
defensive screens.

04:33.997 --> 04:36.090
Keep those screens up.
Fire all phasers.

04:39.502 --> 04:40.992
Firing phasers, Captain.

04:44.474 --> 04:46.271
Alien has screens up, too.

04:46.342 --> 04:48.936
Take all action necessary
to protect the ship.

04:49.012 --> 04:50.445
We'll hold out here.

04:50.513 --> 04:52.310
Are you
under attack, Captain?

04:52.382 --> 04:53.815
We could drop screens.

04:53.883 --> 04:55.316
Keep those screens up.

04:55.385 --> 04:57.649
Worry about us
when the ship is safe.

04:59.189 --> 05:00.156
Kirk out.

05:00.223 --> 05:01.155
[Shell Falls]

05:01.224 --> 05:02.384
[Explosion]

05:02.459 --> 05:05.394
If they lower those screens
to beam us up,

05:05.462 --> 05:07.555
they'll be open
to phaser attack.

05:13.470 --> 05:15.404
We're hopelessly
outnumbered here, Captain.

05:15.472 --> 05:18.407
With those disruptors versus
our hand phasers--

05:18.475 --> 05:20.909
We're stuck with it,
Mr. Spock.

05:20.977 --> 05:24.071
We'll have to make do
with what we've got.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.832
Kelowitz, Lang, flank out.

05:45.902 --> 05:48.427
Lay down fire on coordinates
Mr. Spock gave you--

05:48.505 --> 05:50.939
even if you don't see them.

05:51.007 --> 05:52.440
Keep your heads down.

05:54.511 --> 05:56.445
We're helpless down here,

05:56.513 --> 05:57.844
and the Enterprise--

05:57.914 --> 05:59.745
Sulu's an experienced
combat officer.

05:59.816 --> 06:02.683
It's my ship, Mr. Spock.
I should be there.

06:02.752 --> 06:04.583
We can't even
get at them.

06:04.654 --> 06:06.884
Nor can they at us
at the moment.

06:06.956 --> 06:09.424
Not unless they move
their original position...

06:09.492 --> 06:10.618
to that intervening high ground.

06:11.928 --> 06:14.158
You remember the layout
of this place, the arsenal?

06:14.230 --> 06:16.391
About 100 yards
in that direction.

06:16.466 --> 06:19.526
But after an attack
as thorough as this one--

06:19.602 --> 06:21.695
I'll risk it.

06:21.771 --> 06:23.534
[Explosion]

06:25.508 --> 06:29.638
[Shell Falls]

06:31.481 --> 06:34.917
[Shell Falls]

06:34.984 --> 06:36.451
[Explosion]

06:41.491 --> 06:43.459
Kirk here. Report.

06:43.526 --> 06:44.891
Captain, are you all right?

06:44.961 --> 06:46.519
Never mind me.
What about the ship?

06:46.596 --> 06:48.427
We returned fire
with all phaser banks--

06:48.498 --> 06:50.125
Negative against his
deflector screen.

06:50.199 --> 06:52.030
Arm your photon torpedoes.

06:52.101 --> 06:53.534
Aye, aye, sir.

06:53.603 --> 06:55.230
Arm photon torpedoes.
Stand by.

06:55.305 --> 06:57.432
-Identification on attacking vessel?
-No, sir.

06:57.507 --> 07:00.374
Doesn't correspond with any
configuration we're familiar with.

07:00.443 --> 07:03.378
We can't get visual contact.
She's too far away.

07:03.446 --> 07:05.880
Mr. Sulu,
photon torpedoes locked on.

07:05.949 --> 07:07.974
Photon torpedoes
locked on, Captain.

07:08.051 --> 07:09.348
Fire all banks.

07:14.457 --> 07:16.049
All banks fired, sir.

07:16.125 --> 07:17.387
Sulu--

07:17.460 --> 07:18.620
[Static]

07:18.695 --> 07:21.562
Sulu, our communications
are being interfered with.

07:23.466 --> 07:27.061
[Shell Falls]

07:29.472 --> 07:30.962
Now get this straight.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.905
You do anything
you think necessary

07:32.976 --> 07:34.409
to protect the ship--

07:34.477 --> 07:36.843
Leave orbit, maximum warp, anything.
Clear?

07:36.913 --> 07:38.346
Clear, Captain, but you--

07:38.414 --> 07:41.349
Never mind about me.
Protect my ship.

07:41.417 --> 07:42.349
Yes, sir.

07:43.987 --> 07:45.682
Photon torpedoes negative,
Captain.

07:46.990 --> 07:48.924
I'm warping out of orbit.

07:50.360 --> 07:53.056
Good. Contact me
when you can. Kirk out.

08:00.436 --> 08:02.370
[Shell Falls]

08:02.438 --> 08:03.871
[Explosion]

08:14.917 --> 08:17.886
- How is he, Doctor?
- He'll be dead in halfan hour...

08:17.954 --> 08:20.889
if we don't get him
some decent care.

08:22.291 --> 08:24.191
[Tricorder Sounds]

08:25.461 --> 08:28.897
They're moving.
I've got to get to the captain.

08:31.734 --> 08:33.634
[Shell Falls]

08:43.479 --> 08:45.913
Locked on to the enemy, Captain.

08:45.982 --> 08:48.416
They're moving
toward the high ground.

08:48.484 --> 08:51.112
They've locked on
to my tricorder.

08:57.527 --> 08:59.154
[Explosion]

08:59.228 --> 09:01.992
Very ingenious.
They fed back my impulses...

09:02.065 --> 09:03.089
and built up an overload.

09:03.166 --> 09:04.895
We'll see
how ingenious they are.

09:04.967 --> 09:09.700
Here. Give me a hand
with this grenade launcher.

09:09.772 --> 09:13.173
- Lang!
- Any word from the Enterprise?

09:13.242 --> 09:15.574
Sulu's taken her out oforbit.

09:16.646 --> 09:18.079
They got Lang, sir.

09:19.282 --> 09:20.715
Did you see them?

09:20.783 --> 09:21.875
No, sir.

09:23.453 --> 09:26.047
An evaluation, Mr. Kelowitz.

09:26.122 --> 09:28.090
Where do you think they are?

09:28.157 --> 09:30.421
If I were them, I'd go
to the high ground on the right.

09:30.493 --> 09:33.360
I'd make it 1,200 yards,

09:33.429 --> 09:35.056
azimuth 87.

09:38.668 --> 09:41.933
It's pretty close for one
of these little jewels, Captain.

09:42.004 --> 09:43.904
It'll be a lot closer to them.
Stand clear.

10:06.496 --> 10:07.986
[Communicator Beeps]

10:09.899 --> 10:11.196
Kirk here.

10:11.267 --> 10:13.428
Captain, the alien's withdrawing.

10:13.503 --> 10:15.801
She'sat extreme range,
but our sensors indicate...

10:15.872 --> 10:17.703
she just activated
her transporters.

10:17.774 --> 10:20.402
Lock on to the alien, Mr. Sulu.
I don't want to lose her.

10:20.476 --> 10:22.341
Aye, aye, sir.

10:22.411 --> 10:24.743
Our screens are down.
We can beam you up now, sir.

10:24.814 --> 10:26.975
I want a search party
of 30 medical personnel...

10:27.049 --> 10:29.347
beamed down immediately
to search for survivors.

10:29.418 --> 10:32.410
Notify the transporter room.
Lock onto us. We're beaming up.

10:32.488 --> 10:33.921
Aye, aye, sir.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.885
Captain's log, supplement.

10:39.962 --> 10:41.896
We have beamed back
to the Enterprise...

10:41.964 --> 10:45.229
and immediately set out inpursuit
of the alien vessel.

10:45.301 --> 10:49.135
Appear she aded toward a largely
unexplored section of the galaxy.

10:49.205 --> 10:51.139
Can you tell me what happened?

10:51.207 --> 10:54.643
Scanners reported
a ship approaching.

10:54.710 --> 10:57.270
We get them now and then. They're
all welcome to use our facilities.

10:57.346 --> 10:59.541
- You know that.
- Yes, I know.

10:59.615 --> 11:03.449
They came in
space-normal speed,

11:03.519 --> 11:05.487
using our regular
approach route, but...

11:05.555 --> 11:08.991
they knocked out our phaser
batteries with their first salvo.

11:09.058 --> 11:11.185
From then on
we were helpless.

11:11.260 --> 11:14.195
We weren't expecting anything!
Why should we?

11:14.263 --> 11:16.697
We didn't have anything
anyone would want.

11:16.766 --> 11:18.961
Easy. Easy.

11:19.035 --> 11:21.230
They poured it on like...

11:21.304 --> 11:24.239
like phasers, only worse,
whatever they were using.

11:25.341 --> 11:30.142
I--I tried to signal them.
We called up.

11:30.213 --> 11:32.977
Tried to surrender.
We had women and children.

11:33.049 --> 11:35.040
I told them that!
I begged them!

11:35.117 --> 11:36.345
They wouldn't listen.

11:36.419 --> 11:39.582
They didn't let up
for a moment.

11:41.324 --> 11:45.761
Lieutenant, the Enterprise
received two messages,

11:45.828 --> 11:47.318
ostensibly from Cestus III.

11:47.396 --> 11:49.660
One for the Enterprise
to go there,

11:49.732 --> 11:52.166
and the other for myself
and my tactical crew...

11:52.235 --> 11:53.827
to beam down to the surface.

11:53.903 --> 11:59.273
They hit us a full day before
you got there, Captain.

11:59.342 --> 12:01.708
No messages
came from us, Captain.

12:01.777 --> 12:04.439
Why did they do it?

12:05.615 --> 12:06.707
Why?

12:07.984 --> 12:09.542
Why did they do it?

12:14.523 --> 12:16.957
There has to be a reason.

12:17.026 --> 12:19.426
There has to be a reason!

12:19.495 --> 12:21.963
It was a trap--

12:22.031 --> 12:23.931
Getting the Enterprise
to come to Cestus III,

12:24.000 --> 12:25.900
getting us and our
whole crew to come ashore.

12:25.968 --> 12:27.993
Very clever.
As to the reason--

12:28.070 --> 12:29.799
The reason
is crystal clear.

12:29.872 --> 12:31.169
The Enterprise
is the only protection...

12:31.240 --> 12:32.730
in this section
of the Federation.

12:32.808 --> 12:35.504
Destroy the Enterprise,
and everything is wide open.

12:35.578 --> 12:38.877
You allude to invasion, Captain,
yet positive proof--

12:38.948 --> 12:41.473
I have all the proof I need
on Cestus III.

12:41.550 --> 12:44.246
Not necessarily.
Several possible explanations--

12:44.320 --> 12:46.481
How can you explain
a massacre like that?

12:46.555 --> 12:51.185
No, Mr. Spock, the threat
is clear and immediate.

12:53.262 --> 12:54.422
Invasion.

13:00.670 --> 13:02.035
Very well, then.

13:02.104 --> 13:05.335
If that's the case,

13:05.408 --> 13:07.205
you must make certain
that the alien vessel...

13:07.276 --> 13:09.073
never reaches its home base.

13:09.145 --> 13:11.670
I intend to.
If we can keep them in the dark...

13:11.747 --> 13:13.681
as to our strength,

13:13.749 --> 13:16.411
they'll never dare
move against us.

13:16.485 --> 13:18.316
- Captain to helms man.
- Sulu here, sir.

13:18.387 --> 13:20.855
- Is the alien still making warp 5?
- Affirmative, sir.

13:20.923 --> 13:23.289
- Initiate warp 6.
- Affirmative, sir.

13:23.359 --> 13:26.294
Overtake.
Phaser banks...

13:26.362 --> 13:28.728
Iock on to the enemy vessel.

13:28.798 --> 13:30.789
Stand by for firing orders.

13:30.866 --> 13:32.299
[Siren]

13:33.803 --> 13:35.737
All hands, this is the captain.

13:35.805 --> 13:37.432
We are going into battle.

13:37.506 --> 13:39.235
All hands, battle stations.

13:39.308 --> 13:40.400
Red alert.

13:40.476 --> 13:41.909
I repeat, red alert.

13:41.978 --> 13:43.741
This is no drill.

13:43.813 --> 13:45.747
This is no drill.

13:53.089 --> 13:55.990
Captain's log,
Stardate 3046.2.

13:56.058 --> 13:57.753
We are in hot pursuit...

13:57.827 --> 14:02.355
of the alien vessel which destroyed
the Earth outpost on Cestus III.

14:03.432 --> 14:04.797
- Mr. Depaul.
- Yes, sir.

14:04.867 --> 14:06.801
Position.

14:06.869 --> 14:10.327
22.3 parsecs beyond
latest chart limits, sir.

14:10.406 --> 14:13.466
All scanners lock
into computer banks.

14:13.542 --> 14:16.477
I want a complete
record of this.

14:16.545 --> 14:19.981
Mr. Spock, what do we have
on this general area?

14:20.049 --> 14:21.482
Virtually nothing, Captain.

14:21.550 --> 14:23.484
No records of any explorations.

14:23.552 --> 14:27.488
There are rumors of certain strange
signals on subspace channels.

14:27.556 --> 14:30.525
However, none has
ever been recorded.

14:30.593 --> 14:33.528
Anything on
intelligent life forms?

14:33.596 --> 14:37.760
Nothing specific, Captain.
Unscientific rumors only.

14:37.833 --> 14:40.199
More like... space legends.

14:44.106 --> 14:46.574
Mr. Sulu,
status, alien vessel.

14:46.642 --> 14:48.701
They must be aware
we're after them, sir.

14:48.778 --> 14:50.837
They've gone
to warp 6 also.

14:56.552 --> 14:57.951
Warp factor 7.

14:59.789 --> 15:01.222
Aye, aye, sir.

15:05.561 --> 15:07.358
Something the matter,
Mr. Spock?

15:07.430 --> 15:11.457
A sustained warp 7 speed
will be dangerous, Captain.

15:11.534 --> 15:13.161
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

15:15.071 --> 15:18.939
-I mean to catch them.
-We'll either catch them or blow up.

15:19.008 --> 15:21.442
They may be faster
than we are.

15:22.511 --> 15:23.910
They'll have to prove it.

15:32.588 --> 15:35.284
Yes, Mr. Spock?

15:35.357 --> 15:38.190
-You mean to destroy the alien ship.
-Of course.

15:38.260 --> 15:42.026
I thought perhaps the hot pursuit
alone might be sufficient.

15:42.098 --> 15:43.531
Destruction
may be unnecessary.

15:43.599 --> 15:46.534
Colony Cestus III has been
obliterated, Mr. Spock.

15:46.602 --> 15:49.036
The destruction
of the alien vessel...

15:49.105 --> 15:51.039
will not help
that colony,Jim.

15:51.107 --> 15:53.041
If the aliens go unpunished,

15:53.109 --> 15:54.576
they'll be back,

15:54.643 --> 15:57.544
attacking other
Federation installations.

15:57.613 --> 16:00.173
I merely suggested that
a regard for sentient--

16:00.249 --> 16:02.740
There's no time for that.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.494
It's a matter of policy.

16:13.562 --> 16:15.996
Out here, we're the only
policemen around.

16:16.065 --> 16:17.999
And a crime
has been committed.

16:18.067 --> 16:20.001
Do I make myself clear?

16:20.069 --> 16:21.502
Very clear, Captain.

16:21.570 --> 16:23.003
I'm delighted, Mr. Spock.

16:25.074 --> 16:27.008
Report, Mr. Sulu.

16:27.076 --> 16:29.010
Alien ship maintaining interval,
Captain.

16:29.078 --> 16:31.512
Now at warp 7.

16:42.525 --> 16:43.958
Warp factor 8.

16:49.431 --> 16:51.296
Aye, aye, sir.

16:55.571 --> 16:57.004
Captain to phaser banks.

16:57.072 --> 16:59.006
All components
at battle ready.

16:59.074 --> 17:02.009
All banks primed.

17:02.077 --> 17:03.271
Aft phaser to Bridge.

17:03.345 --> 17:06.609
Alert status.
All weaponsat operational ready.

17:19.994 --> 17:20.926
Captain.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.258
Yes, Mr. Sulu.

17:22.330 --> 17:23.923
Closing on target, sir.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.465
Good. Mr. Depaul.

17:25.534 --> 17:27.468
- Yes, sir.
- Our position.

17:27.536 --> 17:30.528
2279 pl, sir.

17:33.475 --> 17:37.206
Uncharted solar system at 2466 pm.

17:39.615 --> 17:42.049
Is it on
the alien's course?

17:42.117 --> 17:43.049
No, sir.

17:43.118 --> 17:44.585
He's headed away from it.

17:44.653 --> 17:47.451
Captain, sensors report
we're being scanned.

17:49.058 --> 17:50.821
By the alien ship?

17:50.893 --> 17:53.828
No, sir.
It's from that solar system ahead.

17:55.531 --> 17:57.158
Any interference,
resistance?

17:57.233 --> 18:01.431
No, sir,
Just scanning beams.

18:01.503 --> 18:04.404
It's on
an unusual wave length.

18:04.473 --> 18:05.565
Mr. Spock?

18:05.641 --> 18:08.735
It would appear
someone is curious about us.

18:10.579 --> 18:13.173
Mr. Sulu.

18:13.249 --> 18:15.547
Is the alien still heading away
from that solar system?

18:15.618 --> 18:17.483
Yes, sir.
We're closing, sir.

18:17.553 --> 18:20.545
Lieutenant Uhura, anything further
on those scanning beams?

18:20.623 --> 18:22.056
There's no hostility, sir.

18:22.124 --> 18:25.059
They're not tractors
or weapons ofany sort,

18:25.127 --> 18:27.891
Just increasing in intensity.

18:29.765 --> 18:30.732
Steady.

18:30.799 --> 18:32.289
Regular.

18:32.368 --> 18:33.835
It's growing stronger, sir.

18:33.902 --> 18:34.834
Captain!

18:34.903 --> 18:36.302
Yes, what is it?

18:36.372 --> 18:38.203
The alien...
it's slowing down.

18:38.274 --> 18:43.735
Warp 5...4...2.

18:46.048 --> 18:48.380
It's going sublight, sir.

18:48.450 --> 18:49.382
Sir?

18:51.954 --> 18:53.546
It's stopped dead in space.

18:53.622 --> 18:56.921
He may be turning to fight.

18:56.992 --> 18:58.254
No, sir.

18:58.327 --> 19:01.353
They're just dead out there.

19:01.430 --> 19:02.863
Are you sure?

19:02.931 --> 19:05.058
Yes, sir.

19:05.134 --> 19:06.499
Unmoving.

19:08.671 --> 19:11.765
Then we've got him!
Go to red alert.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.934
Prepare to fire phaser banks.
Sensors lock on.

19:15.010 --> 19:17.069
Mr. Sulu, continue closing.
Mr. Spock--

19:17.146 --> 19:21.845
Lock phasers into computer.
Computers will control attack.

19:21.917 --> 19:24.408
Computer lock ready, Captain.
All systems standing by.

19:24.486 --> 19:26.977
Range is 1810...

19:27.056 --> 19:29.081
1760...

19:29.158 --> 19:31.820
Range is 1700...

19:31.894 --> 19:33.691
1640...

19:33.762 --> 19:35.957
Range is 1590...

19:36.031 --> 19:39.694
1550 and closing, sir.

19:39.768 --> 19:41.736
[Crash]

19:41.804 --> 19:45.069
Warp 6... Warp 5...

19:45.140 --> 19:47.040
4... Warp 3...

19:47.109 --> 19:48.041
Warp 1 .

19:48.110 --> 19:50.340
Sublight, Captain.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.640
We're stopped, Captain.

19:56.719 --> 19:59.210
It's impossible, but...

20:04.727 --> 20:05.659
It's impossible.

20:05.728 --> 20:07.992
Warp 8?
Have you lost your mind?

20:08.063 --> 20:09.997
Same as the alien, Captain.

20:13.869 --> 20:16.099
- Mr. Scott, report.
- We're dead, Captain.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.604
Locked up.
Frozen tight.

20:17.673 --> 20:19.607
All propulsion systems
read zero.

20:19.675 --> 20:20.607
Life systems?

20:20.676 --> 20:22.803
They're all normal, sir--

20:22.878 --> 20:25.312
Atmosphere, heat, light,
no variance.

20:25.381 --> 20:27.406
Phaser banks. Report.

20:27.483 --> 20:29.383
We're all in operative
here, Captain.

20:29.451 --> 20:30.884
No power at all.

20:30.953 --> 20:33.387
No faulty circuits
I can find.

20:33.455 --> 20:36.049
Just no power.

20:36.125 --> 20:37.558
Damage Control, report.

20:37.626 --> 20:40.686
All systems report normal, Captain.
No ascertainable damage.

20:40.763 --> 20:42.424
Then what is it?

20:42.498 --> 20:45.331
I don't know, sir,
but whatever it is, we cannot move.

20:45.401 --> 20:47.460
We're being held
in place, Captain,

20:47.536 --> 20:49.697
apparently
from that solar system.

20:49.772 --> 20:52.036
This far out?
That's impossible.

20:52.107 --> 20:54.302
We are being held.

20:56.412 --> 20:57.344
Tractor beam?

20:57.413 --> 21:00.007
No, sir,
an unidentifiable power.

21:22.671 --> 21:24.434
[Male Voice]
We are the Metrons.

21:27.042 --> 21:29.875
You are one of two crafts...

21:29.945 --> 21:33.972
which have come into our space
on a mission of violence.

21:34.049 --> 21:37.883
This is not permissible. Yet we have
analyzed you and have learned...

21:37.953 --> 21:40.183
that your violent tendencies
are inherent.

21:40.255 --> 21:44.419
So be it.
We will control them.

21:44.493 --> 21:46.518
We will resolve your conflict...

21:46.595 --> 21:50.053
in the way most suited
to your limited mentalities.

21:52.067 --> 21:53.659
Captain James Kirk.

21:55.737 --> 21:57.204
This is Kirk.

21:57.272 --> 22:00.332
We have prepared a planet
with a suitable atmosphere.

22:00.409 --> 22:02.343
You will be taken there...

22:02.411 --> 22:06.780
as will the Captain of the Gorn ship
which you have been pursuing.

22:06.849 --> 22:09.283
There you will
settle your dispute.

22:09.351 --> 22:10.875
I... don't understand.

22:10.953 --> 22:14.116
You will be provided with
a recording-translating device,

22:14.189 --> 22:16.555
in hopes that a chronicle
ofthis contest...

22:16.625 --> 22:19.560
will serve to dissuade others
of your kind...

22:19.628 --> 22:21.061
from entering our system--

22:21.129 --> 22:24.326
but you will not be permitted
to communicate with your ship.

22:24.399 --> 22:27.891
You will each
be totally alone.

22:27.970 --> 22:29.904
What makes you think
you can interfere--

22:29.972 --> 22:31.906
It is you who are interfering.

22:31.974 --> 22:34.943
We are simply
putting a stop to it.

22:35.010 --> 22:36.409
The place we have
prepared foryou...

22:36.478 --> 22:39.447
contains sufficient elements
for either ofyou...

22:39.515 --> 22:42.484
to construct weapons lethal enough
to destroy the other,

22:42.551 --> 22:45.076
which seems
to be your intention.

22:45.153 --> 22:47.212
The winner ofthe contest
will be permitted...

22:47.289 --> 22:49.223
to go his way unharmed.

22:49.291 --> 22:51.725
The loser,
along with his ship,

22:51.793 --> 22:54.284
shall be destroyed
in the interests of peace.

22:54.363 --> 22:57.924
The contest will be one
of ingenuity against ingenuity,

22:58.000 --> 22:59.934
brute strength
against brute strength.

23:00.002 --> 23:03.267
The results will be final.

23:03.338 --> 23:06.933
-Just a min--
- There will be no discussion.

23:07.009 --> 23:08.442
It is done.

23:10.913 --> 23:12.278
Aah!

23:13.949 --> 23:15.109
He's gone.

23:21.423 --> 23:23.983
[Roaring, Hissing]

23:40.776 --> 23:42.539
The Enterprise
is dead in space,

23:42.611 --> 23:44.306
stopped cold
during her pursuit

23:44.379 --> 23:46.813
of an alien raider
by mysterious forces,

23:46.882 --> 23:49.908
and I have been somehow
whisked off the bridge

23:49.985 --> 23:52.920
and placed on the surface
of an asteroid,

23:52.988 --> 23:55.923
facing the captain
of the alien ship.

23:55.991 --> 23:57.219
Weaponless,

23:57.292 --> 24:00.887
I face the creature
the Metrons calleda Gorn--

24:00.963 --> 24:03.523
Large, reptilian.

24:03.599 --> 24:05.590
Like most humans,

24:05.667 --> 24:09.501
I seem to have an instinctive
revulsion to reptiles.

24:09.571 --> 24:12.506
I must fight to remember
that this is

24:12.574 --> 24:15.441
an intelligent,
highly advanced individual--

24:15.510 --> 24:19.173
the captain ofa starship,
like myself,

24:19.247 --> 24:24.184
undoubtedly a dangerously
clever opponent.

24:28.023 --> 24:30.423
[Hissing]

24:35.397 --> 24:37.331
[Growling]

25:01.857 --> 25:05.349
[Hissing]

25:05.427 --> 25:07.361
[Growling]

25:22.944 --> 25:24.878
[Growling]

25:30.052 --> 25:31.986
[Hissing]

26:29.311 --> 26:30.744
You tried overload?

26:30.812 --> 26:32.746
Aye, sir.
It does no good.

26:34.516 --> 26:36.950
How about bypassing
the transformer banks--

26:37.018 --> 26:39.077
feed the impulse engines
directly?

26:39.154 --> 26:40.587
I tried that, sir--

26:40.655 --> 26:42.020
Nothing.

26:45.894 --> 26:48.419
Lieutenant Uhura,
have sensors learned anything...

26:48.497 --> 26:50.522
about the nature ofthe force
which holds us here?

26:50.599 --> 26:54.501
No, sir. They report they emanate
from that solar system ahead.

26:54.569 --> 26:56.366
No indication
of its composition--

26:56.438 --> 27:00.101
gravimetric, magnetic,
electronic?

27:00.175 --> 27:01.642
Nothing, sir.

27:10.919 --> 27:13.012
This is Captain James Kirk

27:13.088 --> 27:14.817
of the Starship Enterprise.

27:17.025 --> 27:18.617
Who ever finds this...

27:20.095 --> 27:22.620
please get it
to Star fleet Command.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.734
I'm engaged
in personal combat...

27:26.802 --> 27:29.635
with a creature
apparently called a Gorn.

27:29.704 --> 27:31.535
He's immensely strong.

27:31.606 --> 27:33.631
Already he has with stood
attacks from me...

27:33.708 --> 27:36.643
that would have killed
a human being.

27:36.711 --> 27:39.646
Fortunately, though strong,
he is not agile.

27:39.714 --> 27:44.151
The agility, and I hope
the cleverness, is mine.

27:44.219 --> 27:48.417
The Metrons, the creatures
that sent us both here,

27:49.958 --> 27:53.052
said that the surface
of the planet...

27:53.128 --> 27:55.062
provides the raw material...

27:56.631 --> 27:59.896
to construct... weapons.

27:59.968 --> 28:03.904
There's very little here--
scrub brush, rocks,

28:03.972 --> 28:06.497
an abundance
of mineral deposits--

28:06.575 --> 28:09.510
but no weapons
in the conventional sense.

28:11.513 --> 28:13.947
Still, I need to find one.

28:16.251 --> 28:18.082
Bare-handed...

28:18.153 --> 28:19.586
against the Gorn...

28:21.122 --> 28:22.555
I have no chance.

28:26.761 --> 28:29.389
Leave channel one open,
Lieutenant, just in case.

28:29.464 --> 28:30.988
Aye, aye, sir.

28:31.066 --> 28:33.660
What are you going to do,
Mr. Spock?

28:33.735 --> 28:35.566
I'm going to wait, Doctor.

28:35.637 --> 28:38.572
There is little else I can do.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.733
What about the captain?

28:40.809 --> 28:44.711
If I could help him, I would.

28:44.779 --> 28:46.542
I cannot.

28:46.615 --> 28:49.550
Now, you're the one that's
always talking about logic.

28:49.618 --> 28:51.313
What about some logic now?

28:51.386 --> 28:55.482
Where's the captain, Mr. Spock?

28:55.557 --> 28:57.957
He's out there, Doctor--

28:58.026 --> 28:59.459
out there somewhere...

28:59.527 --> 29:02.496
in 1,000 cubic
parsecs ofspace,

29:02.564 --> 29:06.432
and there's absolutely
nothing we can do to help him.

29:42.437 --> 29:44.462
[Growling, Chuckling]

30:09.464 --> 30:12.900
A large deposit of diamonds
on the surface--

30:12.968 --> 30:17.337
perhaps the hardest substance
known in the universe,

30:17.405 --> 30:20.169
beautifully crystallized
and pointed,

30:20.241 --> 30:23.677
but too small to be
useful as a weapon.

30:29.551 --> 30:32.349
An incredible fortune
in stones...

30:33.822 --> 30:37.758
yet I would trade them all
for a hand phaser,

30:37.826 --> 30:41.626
or a good solid club.

30:41.696 --> 30:44.631
Yet the Metrons said
there would be weapons...

30:44.699 --> 30:47.361
if I could find them.

30:47.435 --> 30:48.561
Where?

30:49.637 --> 30:51.696
- [Gorn Growling]
- What kind?

31:00.081 --> 31:01.946
[Growling, Hissing]

32:31.339 --> 32:32.431
[Growling]

33:40.742 --> 33:42.676
[Gorn Growling]

33:51.486 --> 33:53.420
[Hissing]

34:03.498 --> 34:04.590
[Growling]

34:10.905 --> 34:12.873
[Hissing]

34:34.128 --> 34:37.063
This is the U.S.S. Enterprise
calling the Metrons.

34:37.130 --> 34:40.965
Our channels are open.
Come in, please.

34:52.313 --> 34:54.940
We urgently desire
a conference.

34:55.016 --> 34:56.005
Please answer.

35:10.965 --> 35:13.399
This may be my last entry.

35:13.468 --> 35:15.402
I am almost exhausted.

35:17.972 --> 35:21.999
Unless I find the weapon
the Metron mentioned...

35:22.076 --> 35:24.408
I have very little time left.

35:27.649 --> 35:29.412
Native sulfur, diamonds.

35:29.484 --> 35:31.918
This place is
a mineralogist's dream.

35:36.491 --> 35:38.425
Yet...

35:38.493 --> 35:42.930
there is something...
about sulfur.

35:44.499 --> 35:46.933
Something very old.
Something--

35:47.001 --> 35:49.435
[Growling]

35:49.504 --> 35:52.439
If only I could remember.

36:01.149 --> 36:03.947
The ship, our engines,
our weapons...

36:04.018 --> 36:07.886
it'sjust inconceivable
that we are immobilized.

36:09.457 --> 36:11.391
But it has happened, Doctor.

36:18.966 --> 36:20.297
We are the Metrons.

36:20.368 --> 36:23.394
Your captain
is losing his battle.

36:23.471 --> 36:25.405
We would suggest you make...

36:25.473 --> 36:27.907
whatever memorial arrangements,
if any,

36:27.975 --> 36:30.910
which are customary
in your culture.

36:30.978 --> 36:35.972
We believe you have
very little time left.

36:36.050 --> 36:39.816
We appeal to you in the name
of civilization.

36:39.887 --> 36:41.320
Put a stop to this.

36:41.389 --> 36:43.289
Your violent intent
and actions...

36:43.358 --> 36:46.919
demonstrate
that you are not civilized.

36:46.994 --> 36:50.930
However, we are not
without compassion.

36:50.998 --> 36:55.435
It is possible you may have
feelings toward your captain.

36:55.503 --> 36:58.939
So that you will be able
to prepare yourself,

36:59.006 --> 37:00.940
we will allow you
to see and hear...

37:01.008 --> 37:04.000
what is now transpiring.

37:06.848 --> 37:08.873
[Hissing]

37:21.929 --> 37:25.888
If there were only some way
we could contact him.

37:25.967 --> 37:28.367
Yes, indeed, Doctor,
if only there were.

37:28.436 --> 37:31.405
Notice the substance
encrusting that rock.

37:32.974 --> 37:33.906
Yes.

37:33.975 --> 37:35.909
Unless I'm mistaken,

37:35.977 --> 37:38.343
it's potassium nitrate.

37:38.413 --> 37:39.345
So?

37:39.414 --> 37:40.574
Perhaps nothing, Doctor.

37:44.485 --> 37:46.282
Perhaps everything.

38:07.942 --> 38:09.375
Earthling!

38:11.446 --> 38:13.380
Captain!

38:14.449 --> 38:16.383
Who is this, the Metron?

38:16.451 --> 38:20.387
This is your opponent,
Earthling.

38:20.455 --> 38:25.757
I have heard every word
you have said.

38:25.827 --> 38:28.455
All right.
What do you want?

38:28.529 --> 38:32.397
I'm weary of the chase.

38:32.467 --> 38:34.401
Wait for me.

38:34.469 --> 38:38.872
I shall be merciful and quick.

38:38.940 --> 38:41.408
Like you were at Cestus III?

38:41.476 --> 38:43.410
You were intruding!

38:43.478 --> 38:48.211
You established an outpost
in our space.

38:48.282 --> 38:50.409
You butchered
helpless human beings--

38:50.485 --> 38:52.919
We destroyed invaders,

38:52.987 --> 38:56.423
as I shall destroy you!

39:02.497 --> 39:03.930
Can that be true?

39:03.998 --> 39:06.796
Was Cestus III an intrusion
on their space?

39:06.868 --> 39:08.859
It may well be possible, Doctor.

39:08.936 --> 39:12.372
We know very little about
that section of the galaxy.

39:13.941 --> 39:16.967
Then we could be
in the wrong.

39:17.044 --> 39:18.875
Perhaps.

39:18.946 --> 39:22.382
That is something
best decided by diplomats.

39:22.450 --> 39:25.578
The Gorn simply might have been
trying to protect themselves.

39:25.653 --> 39:26.881
Yes.

39:33.961 --> 39:35.895
[Gorn Snarls]

39:38.199 --> 39:41.362
[Hissing]

40:04.492 --> 40:06.119
Fascinating.

40:08.496 --> 40:09.428
Good.

40:10.998 --> 40:11.930
Good.

40:22.510 --> 40:24.978
He knows, Doctor.

40:25.046 --> 40:26.946
He has reasoned it out.

40:38.025 --> 40:39.959
[Gorn Snarls]

40:53.541 --> 40:54.473
Yes.

40:54.542 --> 40:55.975
Yes.

40:56.043 --> 40:57.476
What is it, Spock?

40:57.545 --> 40:58.978
An invention, Doctor.

40:59.046 --> 41:00.911
First potassium nitrate,

41:00.982 --> 41:03.917
and now if he can
find some sulfur...

41:03.985 --> 41:07.853
and a charcoal deposit
or ordinary coal...

41:29.443 --> 41:31.434
What's he doing?

41:31.512 --> 41:34.447
Diamonds--
the hardest known substance.

41:34.515 --> 41:35.948
Impelled by sufficient force,

41:36.017 --> 41:37.951
they would make
formidable projectiles.

41:38.019 --> 41:40.613
What force?

41:40.688 --> 41:43.088
Recall your basic chemistry,
Doctor.

41:43.157 --> 41:44.454
Gunpowder.

41:44.525 --> 41:49.155
Captain, let us be reasonable.

41:49.230 --> 41:51.960
You have lost!

41:52.033 --> 41:53.933
Admit it to yourself!

41:54.001 --> 41:57.095
Stop running!

42:15.056 --> 42:15.988
Coal.

42:27.601 --> 42:30.297
[Hissing]

43:14.515 --> 43:16.540
Can he do it?

43:19.954 --> 43:22.218
If he has the time, Doctor.

43:24.325 --> 43:26.850
If he has the time.

44:12.306 --> 44:14.001
[Hissing]

44:22.783 --> 44:24.910
[Growling]

45:14.301 --> 45:15.268
No.

45:17.605 --> 45:19.539
No, I won't kill you.

45:21.108 --> 45:23.406
Maybe you thought you were...

45:23.477 --> 45:25.604
protecting yourself...

45:25.679 --> 45:27.647
when you attacked the outpost.

45:37.625 --> 45:40.059
No, I won't kill him!

45:40.127 --> 45:42.652
Do you hear?

45:42.730 --> 45:45.824
You'll have to get
your entertainment someplace else!

46:03.717 --> 46:05.150
You're a Metron?

46:05.219 --> 46:07.380
Does my appearance
surprise you, Captain?

46:10.224 --> 46:12.658
You seem more like a boy.

46:12.726 --> 46:16.924
I am approximately
1,500 of your Earth years old.

46:16.997 --> 46:19.329
You surprise me, Captain.

46:19.400 --> 46:20.992
How?

46:21.068 --> 46:23.093
By sparing your helpless enemy--

46:23.170 --> 46:25.900
who surely would
have destroyed you--

46:25.973 --> 46:29.465
you demonstrated
the advanced trait of mercy,

46:29.543 --> 46:31.340
something we hardly expected.

46:31.412 --> 46:34.347
We feel there may be
hope for your kind.

46:34.415 --> 46:36.849
Therefore you will
not be destroyed.

46:36.917 --> 46:39.784
It would not be... civilized.

46:44.091 --> 46:45.854
What happened to the Gorn?

46:45.926 --> 46:49.020
I sent him
back to his ship.

46:49.096 --> 46:52.554
If you like,
I shall destroy him for you.

46:52.633 --> 46:55.534
No. That won't be necessary.

46:58.272 --> 47:00.206
We can talk...

47:00.274 --> 47:01.798
maybe...

47:01.875 --> 47:03.809
reach an agreement.

47:03.877 --> 47:05.777
Very good, Captain.

47:05.846 --> 47:08.246
There is hope for you.

47:08.315 --> 47:11.341
Perhaps in
several thousand years,

47:11.418 --> 47:13.409
your people and mine...

47:13.487 --> 47:16.786
shall meet
to reach an agreement.

47:16.857 --> 47:19.917
You are still halfsavage,

47:19.994 --> 47:21.461
but there is hope.

47:21.528 --> 47:24.895
We will contact you
when we are ready.

47:30.604 --> 47:31.662
[Uhura]
Captain!

47:31.739 --> 47:33.172
Are you all right?

47:33.240 --> 47:34.673
I don't know.

47:36.944 --> 47:38.377
I don't know.

47:39.580 --> 47:42.310
All right, everybody.
Back to your posts.

47:42.383 --> 47:44.317
Let's get out of here.

47:54.328 --> 47:55.260
Captain.

47:55.329 --> 47:56.261
Mr. Sulu.

47:56.330 --> 47:58.423
It's impossible, but...

47:58.499 --> 48:00.990
there's Sirius over there
when it should be here.

48:01.068 --> 48:02.194
And Canopus...

48:02.269 --> 48:04.203
and Arcanis.

48:04.271 --> 48:05.829
We're--

48:05.906 --> 48:09.273
All of a sudden,
we're clear across the galaxy,

48:09.343 --> 48:12.540
500 parsecs from where we are--
I mean, were.

48:12.613 --> 48:13.545
I mean--

48:13.614 --> 48:16.014
Don't try and figure it out,
Mr. Sulu.

48:16.083 --> 48:19.018
Just plot a course for us
back to Cestus III.

48:19.086 --> 48:20.519
Aye, aye, sir.

48:29.863 --> 48:32.525
After you touched off
your primitive cannon, Captain,

48:32.599 --> 48:35.500
we lost the picture
the Metron was sending us.

48:35.569 --> 48:39.300
- You saw what happened down there?
- Most of it.

48:39.373 --> 48:43.036
I would be interested in knowing
what finally happened.

48:43.110 --> 48:46.045
We're a most promising
species, Mr. Spock...

48:46.113 --> 48:48.547
as predators go.
Did you know that?

48:48.615 --> 48:51.345
I've frequently had my doubts.

48:51.418 --> 48:53.045
I don't.

48:53.120 --> 48:55.054
Not anymore.

48:55.122 --> 48:58.888
And maybe in
a thousand years or so,

48:58.959 --> 49:00.824
we'll be able to prove it.

49:00.894 --> 49:02.327
Never mind, Mr. Spock.

49:02.396 --> 49:05.331
It doesn't make
much sense to me either.

49:05.399 --> 49:08.527
Take us back to where
we're supposed to be, Mr. Sulu.

49:08.602 --> 49:10.035
Warp factor 1 .

49:10.104 --> 49:11.935
Warp factor 1 .

49:12.005 --> 49:14.269
A thousand years, Captain?

49:14.341 --> 49:17.799
Well, that gives us
a little time.
