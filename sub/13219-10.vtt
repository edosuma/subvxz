13:21.635 --> 13:23.268
I'll fill up the bus.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.470
Oh, yeah, Sadie.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.840
We'll be Zondo-ing
all over Beverly Hills.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.284
Will you tell me now, Charlie?

13:43.089 --> 13:44.956
Tell you what?

13:47.060 --> 13:49.260
I hate my father.

13:50.030 --> 13:53.164
He has never loved me.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.135
He doesn't even think
I'm pretty.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.636
Cherry...

14:00.173 --> 14:01.472
You...

14:02.776 --> 14:05.376
Are the prettiest girl
on Earth.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.485
Do you know
my father's secret?

14:17.557 --> 14:19.190
Look, Cherry...

14:24.097 --> 14:27.999
...you accept there's no past,
no future.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.468
There's only what we feel,

14:30.470 --> 14:32.904
what we know right here
in our skin,

14:32.906 --> 14:35.340
-in our hearts.
-Yes.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.308
So search in yourself.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.080
What do you think
is your father's secret?

14:50.957 --> 14:52.891
My father can't love.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.494
And he can't be loved.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.365
(SNICKERS)

15:00.767 --> 15:02.200
It's all right.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.402
You tried to love him.

15:04.771 --> 15:06.671
Your mother tried.

15:06.673 --> 15:10.108
I tried. And, and...

15:11.811 --> 15:13.244
He can't.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.115
Cherry, come here.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.219
You're wiser than all of us.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.689
You've taught me why
we're so lucky.

15:25.992 --> 15:30.528
We can give and receive love.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.333
That's why we're
a real family.

15:46.947 --> 15:51.115
What do I have to do to get
a cup of coffee around here?

15:51.117 --> 15:53.618
Any idea who spiked
your drink?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.787
No, I don't remember.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.890
It's like a blur. A bad dream.

15:58.892 --> 16:02.560
You know, um,
Moran really saved your ass.

16:02.562 --> 16:05.229
Yeah, that much I do know.
He called you?

16:05.231 --> 16:07.665
And the cab company and got
the address where you were.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.201
Moran somehow knew that
you were high on something

16:10.203 --> 16:13.204
and for some reason figured
I'd know how to handle it.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.506
Yeah. Wild guess, huh?

16:15.508 --> 16:16.741
Mmm.

16:16.943 --> 16:21.446
I told you that, uh,
Emma and Rick were at Spiral.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.181
What happened to my buttons?

16:24.417 --> 16:26.084
Last night you went
to the Karn's...

16:26.086 --> 16:27.785
No, shh. I don't want to know,

16:27.787 --> 16:29.420
that's enough.
I don't want to know.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.055
Um, what did you
say about Emma?

16:31.057 --> 16:31.956
She was at Spiral.

16:31.958 --> 16:34.892
-You want to do
something about...
-I don't care.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.362
You don't care?

16:37.697 --> 16:39.063
You don't... Are you serious?

16:39.065 --> 16:40.965
You dragged us into
this because...

16:40.967 --> 16:42.266
Let me rephrase that.

16:42.268 --> 16:43.901
I do care. I'll handle it.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.570
Yeah. Look,
Ricky's there, okay?

16:45.572 --> 16:47.105
And at any minute,
he could tell Roy

16:47.107 --> 16:50.408
-or Guapo that I'm a cop.
-Mmm-hmm.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.877
-We got to handle that.
-Mmm.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.080
Deputize him.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.683
-Do what?
-Make him your deputy.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.959

17:07.961 --> 17:09.894

17:12.065 --> 17:13.564
-Joe.
-Hi, Sam.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.467
-How you feeling?
-Thank you for last night.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.770
You really, you saved my ass.

17:18.772 --> 17:22.907
Yeah, well, I want to cash
that check right now, Sam.

17:25.745 --> 17:28.179
That's a little quick,
but okay.

17:29.716 --> 17:30.748
Yeah, I saw this.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.316
Salazar's got a hair
up his ass

17:32.318 --> 17:34.385
about the Echo Park
bus robberies.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.753
Thinks the LAPD
would be better off

17:35.755 --> 17:37.622
if there was more
Chicano detectives.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.390
I'm Cuban, Sam.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.759
My real name is Jose Moran.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.294
No. Don't bull.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.695
Really? You're not Irish?
You're Cuban?

17:44.697 --> 17:47.965
Moran's a common Irish name,
but it's also Spanish.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.767
In junior high,
I started calling myself Joe

17:49.769 --> 17:53.104
and when I moved out here,
after serving in Korea,

17:53.106 --> 17:54.872
everyone assumed I was Irish.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.841
Assumed or you led them on?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.143
A little of both.

17:59.145 --> 18:00.611
My people are fair-skinned.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.413
My grandma had red hair
and blue eyes.

18:02.415 --> 18:06.717
So when I met my wife Maggie,
I let her think I was Irish.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.287
-Why? Did she say...
-Her father hates Mexicans.

18:09.289 --> 18:12.290
A lot of daughters like to
defy their daddies.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.424
Not Maggie.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.459
When I met her, she was 18.

18:14.461 --> 18:17.261
A very obedient,
good little Catholic girl.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.163
If her father objected...

18:19.933 --> 18:20.698
I don't know.

18:20.700 --> 18:24.001
You know, maybe we would've
gotten married.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.870
Maybe.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.307
I love Maggie and my boys.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.910
My beautiful red-headed,
blue-eyed sons.

18:32.912 --> 18:33.778
They're the world to me.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.581
All these years,
you've never told Maggie

18:36.583 --> 18:37.682
that you were Cuban?

18:37.684 --> 18:38.683
I didn't have to.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.585
My father died
when I was six.

18:40.587 --> 18:41.853
My mom passed
when I was in Korea.

18:41.855 --> 18:43.621
And the rest of my people
are still in Cuba.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.124
And Castro's making sure
they don't show up.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.091
And when I joined
the department,

18:47.093 --> 18:50.294
of course it's better for me
if nobody knows I'm Latino.

18:50.296 --> 18:50.728
Let's be honest.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.630
You really think
I would've made detective

18:52.632 --> 18:54.799
if the brass knew
I was a spic?

18:54.801 --> 18:57.635
So I assume Salazar found out?

18:58.171 --> 18:59.070
Yeah.

18:59.072 --> 19:02.240
I can't, for the life of me,
figure out how he knows.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.343
Says I'm the only Latino
detective in the department,

19:05.345 --> 19:06.344
which pisses him off.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.912
But what really pisses
him off is,

19:07.914 --> 19:10.114
what good is it if
nobody knows?

19:10.316 --> 19:10.882
Wants to interview me.

19:10.884 --> 19:15.286
Says it'll give me power
in the department
to help Latinos.

19:15.488 --> 19:15.920
I refused.

19:15.922 --> 19:19.223
Salazar told me that, with or
without my cooperation,

19:19.225 --> 19:21.425
his next column,
a week from today,

19:21.427 --> 19:22.527
is gonna be about me.

19:22.529 --> 19:25.663
He promised me that if
I alert the brass first,

19:25.665 --> 19:27.798
he'll let me claim
I did it voluntarily.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.333
Says it'll look good
for everybody to have

19:29.335 --> 19:33.204
a positive story about
a Latino in the department.

19:33.206 --> 19:36.040
Only problem about
this positive story,

19:36.976 --> 19:39.243
it's gonna destroy my life.

-It's just temporary.

his wife and boys himself?

-Why send you?
-He didn't think

21:09.469 --> 21:11.502
you'd believe him,
so he told me his secret

21:11.504 --> 21:14.905
to prove to you that he
would tell the truth
to the department.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.507
-Okay, good. So it's settled.
-Eventually.

21:16.509 --> 21:20.177
He'll need some time
to break the news
to his family slowly.

-Yeah.

for my tactlessness.

every chance to make

his heritage less damaging,

24:23.596 --> 24:25.029
But thank you.

24:41.314 --> 24:43.214
Yeah, it's Gregory Mitchell.

24:43.216 --> 24:45.850
Any grade.
I don't know how old he is.

24:47.286 --> 24:48.385
You do?

24:48.387 --> 24:50.154
Do you have a home address?

24:50.456 --> 24:51.021
What the hell?

24:51.023 --> 24:52.957
Rampart's got a call
they say is ours,

24:52.959 --> 24:55.559
704 bus to echo.
Another robbery?

24:55.561 --> 24:56.560
Unis there now!

24:56.562 --> 24:57.895
Did you get a call
about this too, Lieutenant?

24:57.897 --> 25:02.566
Yeah. He killed her this time.
Punk shot her for five bucks.

25:02.568 --> 25:04.168
-Get over there
right now, cut.
-(PHONE RINGS)

25:04.170 --> 25:07.404
This is not Rampart's problem,
this is our mess.

25:07.406 --> 25:10.741
CHARMAIN: Joe, it's for you.
It's Ruben Salazar.

25:10.743 --> 25:12.877
What's that spic
calling you for?

25:13.546 --> 25:15.513
Yeah, well,
don't tell him nothing.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.120
Moran.

25:23.122 --> 25:23.821
Salazar here.

25:23.823 --> 25:26.290
It's all over the wire
about the 704 bus.

25:26.292 --> 25:28.526

25:56.923 --> 25:58.222
Charlie.

26:00.393 --> 26:01.792
Charlie's right.

26:01.894 --> 26:05.629
You are the prettiest
and the smartest.

26:08.634 --> 26:09.900
No.

26:10.403 --> 26:12.670
-You're just as...
-Shh.

26:13.339 --> 26:17.241
-We're sisters, right?
-Right.

26:17.643 --> 26:20.377
Sisters don't lie
to each other.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.748
I am so proud of you.

26:25.751 --> 26:28.018
Don't make me
sit on my pride.

26:29.555 --> 26:31.789
You have to free yourself.

26:32.625 --> 26:35.192
-I've told Charlie...
-Not Charlie.

26:35.428 --> 26:38.929
Charlie can't free you.
I can't free you.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.802
My mother was a drunk.

26:46.405 --> 26:49.974
She didn't take care of me
or my little brother.

26:50.710 --> 26:53.510
And when she got cancer,
I joined the church choir

26:53.512 --> 26:57.348
so I could sing to God
to save her from dying.

26:57.883 --> 26:58.716
(CHUCKLES)

26:58.718 --> 26:59.984
And then when she went into

26:59.986 --> 27:02.553
the hospital for
the last time,

27:02.555 --> 27:04.989
I brought the choir
outside her window

27:04.991 --> 27:07.358
to sing her way to heaven.

27:09.996 --> 27:12.463
And do you know
what she said to me?

27:13.432 --> 27:16.800
Why didn't you just
bring a radio?

27:19.905 --> 27:21.605
I'm so sorry, Sadie.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.174
Don't be sorry, Cherry.

27:25.378 --> 27:27.678
I was lying to myself.

27:28.314 --> 27:32.282
Really, all I ever wanted
was for my mother to die.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.552
Because she wasn't
my mother.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.955
I am my mother.

27:39.358 --> 27:42.393
I gave birth to me.

27:42.928 --> 27:44.395
You have to prove
to yourself

27:44.397 --> 27:47.698
that your mother is no
better than a stranger.

27:49.035 --> 27:53.604
That you don't care
if she lives or dies.

27:57.376 --> 28:00.944

It's time for you to be born.

28:26.706 --> 28:28.238
Yeah, I saw that.

28:28.674 --> 28:29.940
Maggie threw me out.

28:29.942 --> 28:32.076
Said I'll never see
my boys again.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.644
First of all, it's illegal.

28:33.646 --> 28:34.812
All right?
Now, go home,

28:34.814 --> 28:36.647
let her hit you
till her arms are tired,

28:36.649 --> 28:38.048
and then make love to her.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.450
What do I say
to my boys?

28:39.452 --> 28:42.853
Your sons are gonna
love you no matter what.

28:43.989 --> 28:46.123
(SLAPS PAPER)

28:46.125 --> 28:47.691

she could forgive

28:47.693 --> 28:49.693
my screwing around on her,

28:49.695 --> 28:50.494
but this just proves

28:50.496 --> 28:53.063
everything I've said to her
is a lie,

28:53.065 --> 28:54.898
one big lie.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.202
Sam, believe me,

28:58.204 --> 29:00.204
I have got no one
in this world

29:00.206 --> 29:01.972
but Maggie and my boys.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.743
Without them, I am no one.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.681
You can sleep on the couch.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.420
Get out of your car
and wait for the transfer.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.756
When he hands over the goods,
we'll crash the scene,

preserving your cover.

what's the signal?

Look, we're backing you up.

Any trouble, we'll come in
and save your pretty face.

faster than a bullet?

you got the jitters?

Well, you look
green to the gills.
Can you handle this?

29:35.574 --> 29:36.807
Panic will get us all killed.

29:36.809 --> 29:37.541
I can handle the bust.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.443
What I can't handle
is your sloppy planning.

done 50 of these.

an abort signal.

we need him?

I lied to you all?

31:03.729 --> 31:06.296

I was Latino,

39:48.453 --> 39:50.687
Have a Uni bring
that lowlife in.

39:51.289 --> 39:52.555
Sure.

39:52.624 --> 39:54.457
(PHONE RINGS)

41:15.273 --> 41:16.539
Cherry.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.129
(SCOFFS) You.

41:40.565 --> 41:42.432
You did this?
You had me arrested,

41:42.434 --> 41:45.635
dragged down here
like a common criminal?

41:49.741 --> 41:52.876
Thought it was high time
we had a little talk...

41:54.212 --> 41:55.478
Dad.

41:56.748 --> 41:58.948
Get these manacles off me.

42:01.186 --> 42:04.420
"My beamish boy.
Callooh! Callay!"
