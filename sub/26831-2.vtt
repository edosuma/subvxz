WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:09.510
EDWARD (over phone):
He'll be okay.

00:09.552 --> 00:13.055
-He got hit by a car on a bike.
-(shudders)

00:13.097 --> 00:15.683
I'm going to the hospital now.

00:15.725 --> 00:17.727
He did that on purpose.

00:19.812 --> 00:23.107
Eddie, he chose to do that
on purpose instead.

00:23.149 --> 00:25.401
Instead of what?

00:25.443 --> 00:28.487
Instead of whatever he's doing.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.948
I'm going to the hospital.

00:30.990 --> 00:33.576
I'll call from there.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.584
-Thanks, guys.
-Sure.

00:49.592 --> 00:51.594
(sighs)

00:56.974 --> 00:58.934
GLENN:
I'm Sergeant Glenn Purdue

00:58.976 --> 01:00.770
announcing through
this previously open door

01:00.811 --> 01:04.648
my right to exercise
a plain sight search.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.942
(quietly):
Fuck.

01:06.984 --> 01:11.155
-I'm sorry. Did you say "fuck"?
-No, I just said, "Come on in."

01:11.197 --> 01:13.157
-(quietly): Fuck.
-Are you the occupant?

01:13.199 --> 01:16.494
I... am. No.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.204
-What?
-Wh-What?

01:18.245 --> 01:20.039
Well, you said both.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.292
Oh, I'm presently occupying
this space, in these moments,

01:23.334 --> 01:25.169
but I am not the occupant.

01:25.211 --> 01:28.798
Why are you occupying this space
in these moments?

01:28.839 --> 01:32.051
I... work for La-Z-Boy,
of course. (chuckles)

01:32.092 --> 01:35.679
-La-Z-Boy?
-I am the head La-Z-Boy.

01:35.721 --> 01:38.599
-You're the head La-Z-Boy?
-Well, I'm the head of the area.

01:38.641 --> 01:41.310
Uh, we design, manufacture,
sell and deliver

01:41.352 --> 01:43.437
the finest recliners
in the world.

01:43.479 --> 01:45.648
-Did you see that truck outside?
-I did.

01:45.689 --> 01:48.484
Cool. Well, I'm just
finishing up a delivery

01:48.526 --> 01:52.071
and a on-site
recliner walk-through.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.532
-How did it go?
-It was cool.

01:54.573 --> 01:57.159
A very cool delivery.

01:57.201 --> 02:00.246
All right. Cool.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.790
All right.

02:02.832 --> 02:04.208
Yup.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.296
(exhales)

02:14.426 --> 02:17.680
-Hello.
-ALICE: Hello?

02:17.721 --> 02:20.057
Are you, um...

02:20.099 --> 02:23.102
Can I ask you a few questions?
Do you mind?

02:26.939 --> 02:29.441
Do you know a John Lakeman?

02:33.195 --> 02:34.738
I...

02:34.780 --> 02:36.574
(exhales sharply)

02:36.615 --> 02:38.701
I'm sorry.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.744
John Lakeman took
my calming dog--

02:40.786 --> 02:45.624
it's likely-- Charlie,
for a period of time.

02:45.666 --> 02:49.295
I'm still managing
a soaring anxiety level here.

02:49.336 --> 02:53.299
Vigorous exhalations
help regulate my stress.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.509
Okay.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.096
Well, I was just saying...

02:59.138 --> 03:00.973
(exhales sharply)

03:03.017 --> 03:08.480
I was just saying,
no, I can't help you.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.316
Do you live in this complex?

03:10.357 --> 03:13.986
Uh, do you know the occupant
of this apartment?

03:14.028 --> 03:17.531
I don't, I'm afraid.

03:17.573 --> 03:20.951
-He airhorned me.
-What?

03:20.993 --> 03:22.202
John Lakeman.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.747
-What does that mean?
-He...

03:24.788 --> 03:27.666
airhorned my head.

03:33.213 --> 03:37.134
What does he do for you,
your dog?

03:37.176 --> 03:38.886
If I can ask.

03:38.928 --> 03:41.931
He helps maintain
low anxiety environments

03:41.972 --> 03:44.099
and keeps me
from suffering levels

03:44.141 --> 03:45.726
of debilitating depression

03:45.768 --> 03:49.438
and spontaneously harming myself
or crying. (chuckles)

03:50.689 --> 03:53.734
Okay.

03:53.776 --> 03:56.403
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.870
GLENN:
John Lakeman.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.623
He's the guy who called and said
he brought Charlie back.

04:07.665 --> 04:09.625
He called from Luxembourg
last night

04:09.667 --> 04:12.628
and wanted to talk to Charlie.

04:12.670 --> 04:16.131
-Charlie? Your dog?
-Yeah, Charlie.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.968
-Weird guy.
-Yeah, it was
a weird conversation.

04:19.009 --> 04:22.179
That's what I'm saying.
And check this out.

04:22.221 --> 04:26.183
This is a request to interview
from Interpol last week.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.935
One of the names?

04:27.977 --> 04:31.271
John Lakeman, works at McMillan.

04:31.313 --> 04:34.817
You think this is the guy
from the evidence room?

04:34.858 --> 04:37.236
I think he's the guy
who took Charlie, man.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.489
And I think it's all
part of the same thing.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.408
Who takes another guy's dog?

04:44.451 --> 04:47.287
-JEFF: Also my leg.
-GLENN: What?

04:47.329 --> 04:50.124
-My leg.
-What about it?

04:50.165 --> 04:53.293
I'm just saying, taking my leg
was fucked up, too.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.421
GLENN: Totally. That's...
that's what I'm saying.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.214
This is fucked up.

04:57.256 --> 05:00.509
There's a whole thing
going on here, I'm saying.

05:00.551 --> 05:02.636
An international business firm,

05:02.678 --> 05:06.140
homicide, Europe, Interpol.

05:06.181 --> 05:09.727
Man, this is bigger than
an evidence room assault.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.603
John Lakeman.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.647
He's not in Milwaukee,

05:13.689 --> 05:16.483
and he isn't with his regular
traveling party in Luxembourg.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.277
I called McMillan.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.030
He seems to have
just disappeared.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.240
Hey, we solve this,

05:23.282 --> 05:26.827
maybe we can get out
of the evidence room.

05:26.869 --> 05:29.121
Let's find John Lakeman.

05:29.163 --> 05:31.373
We're three good cops, right?

05:31.415 --> 05:34.293
Once upon a time.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.004
No "once upon a time."

05:37.046 --> 05:39.631
Right here, right now.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.176
Long as we help
each other along, right?

05:42.217 --> 05:43.594
GLENN:
Yeah.

05:43.635 --> 05:48.140
Long as I have Charlie,
I can do it all.

05:48.182 --> 05:51.018
ALL:
Misfit Toys.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.826
(window rolls down)

06:10.037 --> 06:11.830
TOM:
Alice.

06:11.872 --> 06:16.210
ALICE: I'm sorry.
I don't know what to do.

06:16.251 --> 06:19.922
TOM: Well, of course
you don't, honey.

06:19.963 --> 06:24.259
But I do,
and it's gonna be okay.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.929
Honey, let me drive.
Get some rest.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.903
TOM:
Looking back,

06:42.945 --> 06:46.323
you might want to ask if we'd...

06:48.325 --> 06:51.578
...well, if we'd quickly passed
the point of no return.

06:51.620 --> 06:54.248
Next.

06:54.289 --> 06:57.501
But that's not how
we assess events such as...

07:00.212 --> 07:04.258
You can always return.
But what do you come back with?

07:04.299 --> 07:06.802
And does what you bring back

07:06.844 --> 07:09.346
justify the toll
and the breaches

07:09.388 --> 07:12.432
and the transgressions
and the occasions

07:12.474 --> 07:16.603
you didn't go by the letter
of the thing?

07:16.645 --> 07:20.899
So that's not the line
we talk about when we assess.

07:20.941 --> 07:24.862
WOMAN:
How do you assess?

07:24.903 --> 07:29.116
We assess impending events
in terms of danger.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.704
In terms of the danger
to the viability of the task

07:33.745 --> 07:35.998
and to the men and women
who perform it.

07:36.039 --> 07:40.419
And the line we try to bear
in mind, in stages like this,

07:40.460 --> 07:45.090
is the line past which danger,
of both those sorts,

07:45.132 --> 07:47.259
increases exponentially.

07:49.261 --> 07:53.098
It's called The Vantasner
Danger Meridian, this line.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.602
That's the term we use

07:56.643 --> 08:01.023
to explain conditions
of encroaching

08:01.064 --> 08:04.902
and encompassing grave danger.

08:06.904 --> 08:08.989
The Vantasner Danger Meridian.

08:24.213 --> 08:26.173
You know, son...

08:26.215 --> 08:29.468
What?

08:29.509 --> 08:33.722
-Did you have to?
-Have to what?

08:35.766 --> 08:39.519
The doobies.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.146
The what?

08:41.188 --> 08:44.399
(sighs)
In Amsterdam.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.860
You know I know about that.

08:46.902 --> 08:48.862
That didn't pass me by

08:48.904 --> 08:52.407
that you couldn't pass
the McMillan drug test.

08:52.449 --> 08:55.827
I know you were smoking
on the weed then.

08:55.869 --> 08:59.248
I've been meaning to talk
to you about that, but...

08:59.289 --> 09:02.000
we've had these other things.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.003
Yeah, we've had
some other things.

09:09.591 --> 09:13.136
-Doobies.
-Stop. That's annoying.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.555
Well, that's what
started all this,

09:15.597 --> 09:18.725
in Amsterdam, 'cause you
were smoking on the weed.

09:18.767 --> 09:22.145
In Amsterdam, obviously.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.690
That's what started all this?

09:24.731 --> 09:26.692
That-That's the jellyfish?

09:26.733 --> 09:30.237
The what?

09:30.279 --> 09:32.656
It's when you try
to solve a problem,

09:32.698 --> 09:35.951
you just make two more.

09:35.993 --> 09:38.287
Why's it called that?

09:38.328 --> 09:41.540
Jellyfish.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.626
Got to be careful when you're
trying to get rid of them.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.462
You try to spear 'em
or something,

09:47.504 --> 09:51.091
they just turn
into two jellyfish.

09:51.133 --> 09:54.886
How do you know this
about jellyfish?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.888
And, yeah, it is that,

09:56.930 --> 09:59.599
'cause you're smoking
on the weed, in Amsterdam,

09:59.641 --> 10:02.019
which your mother and I
have talked to you

10:02.060 --> 10:06.148
about that several times, about
what that does to your brain.

10:06.189 --> 10:07.983
You're smoking on it,

10:08.025 --> 10:10.944
then you have to borrow
Dennis's urine,

10:10.986 --> 10:12.946
then you have to stab him,

10:12.988 --> 10:15.907
then Dennis checks the fucking
newspaper the next day,

10:15.949 --> 10:18.827
then this detective
shows up in Milwaukee.

10:18.869 --> 10:20.495
He also called me.

10:20.537 --> 10:23.165
-TOM: Exactly.
-Thanks.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.916
Well, that's just
another jellyfish.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.502
That's another
jellyfish situation.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.463
We just made more.
Now they're everywhere.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.840
There wouldn't be
any investigation

10:31.882 --> 10:33.925
if you guys had given me
the right information

10:33.967 --> 10:35.886
-on the private flights.
-Well...

10:35.927 --> 10:37.971
Which weren't very private,
by the way.

10:38.013 --> 10:40.140
That was s-someone
at the bureau.

10:40.182 --> 10:42.768
Ah, okay.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.812
Also giving the bag
to the wrong guy.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.647
That was problematic, too, so...

10:47.689 --> 10:50.233
Stop fighting.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.994
We're gonna be okay.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.625
We're all gonna be okay.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.086

13:59.297 --> 14:00.840
Non.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.266
OFFICER:
Step out of the car.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.280
Move away from the car.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.247
Stop.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.839
Shoot yourself.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.592
Shoot yourself.
You're going to Disneyland Paris

14:43.633 --> 14:47.012
and you're not purchasing
the all-inclusive family pass?

14:47.053 --> 14:49.931
You might as well
blow your own head off.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.516
With the all-inclusive,

14:51.558 --> 14:53.643
you don't have to get there
this early.

14:53.685 --> 14:56.062
You breeze through
the express entrance

14:56.104 --> 14:59.482
and you get access to the
FASTPASS lines at every ride.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.943
(laughs):
Oh. I didn't know that.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.570
Yeah. It's good.

15:03.612 --> 15:07.240
It's good at Frontierland,
Adventureland.

15:07.282 --> 15:10.493
I don't remember if it's
accepted at Main Street, U.S.A.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.787
Guillaume? (speaks French)

15:12.829 --> 15:14.623
GUILLAUME:
Oui.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.958
OFFICER: Yeah, it's accepted
at every venue.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.502
(Tom laughs)

15:19.544 --> 15:22.881
Now, there are three different
FASTPASS packages.

15:22.922 --> 15:26.426
I-I got the FASTPASS Carte
Blanche, which doesn't include

15:26.468 --> 15:29.679
FASTPASS access to concessions,
which is why I'm suggesting

15:29.721 --> 15:32.849
you-you purchase
the all-inclusive--

15:32.891 --> 15:35.560
-The Cordon Bleu.
-(chuckling): Yeah.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.938
The food lines are worse than
the wait for the rides, man,

15:38.980 --> 15:40.940
and you're gonna want
to shoot yourself.

15:40.982 --> 15:44.903
(chuckles)
Well, I will inquire about that.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.989
Can I give this back to you?

15:48.031 --> 15:49.658
Please.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.829
Your left rear brake light
is out.

15:54.871 --> 15:57.499
-Please get that fixed.
-For sure. For sure.

15:57.540 --> 16:01.586
And thank you
for the express thing advice.

16:01.628 --> 16:05.298
FASTPASS. Cordon Bleu.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.592
Got it, yeah.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.594
(chuckles) Thank you.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.638
(indistinct radio transmission)

16:16.309 --> 16:19.854
(panting)

16:19.896 --> 16:21.481

Holy shit.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.411

18:00.914 --> 18:06.377
Uh, that... that was a Monday.

18:06.419 --> 18:11.716
10:00 a.m. June, 2002.

18:11.758 --> 18:15.094
The last time I did cocaine.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.978
Leslie.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.814
(clears throat)

18:25.855 --> 18:28.691
I'm Leslie Claret.

18:28.733 --> 18:34.072
And the last time
I did cocaine...

18:34.113 --> 18:37.325
was when that guy was talking.

18:40.328 --> 18:43.289
You see, I had, uh, I had some

18:43.331 --> 18:47.502
in the little crook, um, area--

18:47.544 --> 18:53.299
my, uh, index-thumb
crook area here,

18:53.341 --> 18:56.678
and, uh, yeah.

18:56.719 --> 19:00.265
I... I was pretending
to listen to him.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.100
I-I was...

19:02.141 --> 19:06.396
I was in this-this
listening posture,

19:06.437 --> 19:12.235
but it was just so that I could
do cocaine while I was here,

19:12.277 --> 19:16.865
because I've been having...

19:16.906 --> 19:20.159
I'm going through some...

19:20.201 --> 19:23.788
very confusing times.

19:23.830 --> 19:27.208
You can't do that in here,
Leslie.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.919
I was doing fine. You know?

19:29.961 --> 19:32.338
Feeling good. Getting it done.

19:32.380 --> 19:36.843
And then this-this-this
major a-hole, Lakeman,

19:36.885 --> 19:39.137
he shot me in the face.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.139
We've all made an agreement

19:41.180 --> 19:43.141
never to bring drugs
into this environment.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.352
Absolutely. I... Absolutely.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.771
I agree with you, every word.
(sniffs)

19:48.813 --> 19:51.608
Did... (scoffs)

19:51.649 --> 19:54.903
Did you just do cocaine, Leslie?

19:54.944 --> 19:58.448
A-Again, while I was
talking to you?

19:58.489 --> 20:00.158
Yes.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.286
Are you doing more now
while I'm speaking to you now?

20:05.288 --> 20:08.708
-Yes, I am.
-Okay. You have to leave.

20:11.127 --> 20:14.631
Fine. (sniffs)

20:14.672 --> 20:17.884
You know, it doesn't work,
anyway, ultimately.

20:19.886 --> 20:23.723
So... (sighs) see ya.

20:25.516 --> 20:28.561
Later, losers.

20:28.603 --> 20:31.397

20:45.036 --> 20:46.788
Morning.

20:46.829 --> 20:47.789
Hey.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.333
Last night... that was intense.

20:51.334 --> 20:52.293
Yeah.

20:52.335 --> 20:54.796
How did you sleep?

20:54.837 --> 20:57.423
I made you coffee.

20:57.465 --> 21:00.051
Oh, thanks.

21:00.093 --> 21:03.096
I sit with you for some time.

21:04.138 --> 21:05.890
You don't have to talk.

21:09.394 --> 21:10.687
Is it too warm?

21:10.728 --> 21:13.982
(sighs)
No, it's really good.

21:15.191 --> 21:16.776
I didn't see this last night.

21:16.818 --> 21:19.320
Have you been hurt by men?

21:19.362 --> 21:22.281
A little bit.

21:23.449 --> 21:26.160
Who hurt you, Dennis the Menace?

21:26.202 --> 21:28.287
I call you like this

21:28.329 --> 21:30.373
because everywhere you go

21:30.415 --> 21:32.250
there are little troubles.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.793
Little troubles like these...

21:33.835 --> 21:39.507
In your report you failed
to name your assailant.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.302
I didn't know my assailant.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.473
It's mine, you know?

21:49.934 --> 21:52.311
This is your shirt?

21:52.353 --> 21:54.063
Oui. It's mine.

21:54.105 --> 21:55.106
It's comfortable?

21:57.316 --> 21:59.068
Yeah, it is.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.195
Do you know
why it's comfortable,

22:01.237 --> 22:02.989
Dennis the Menace?

22:03.031 --> 22:04.824
It's very large on you

22:04.866 --> 22:06.034
and reminds you

22:06.075 --> 22:09.662
that someone more powerful
than you

22:09.704 --> 22:11.456
cares about you,

22:11.497 --> 22:15.418
and it makes you feel
safe with me.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.462
Who hurt you?

22:19.130 --> 22:21.132
It wasn't on purpose.

22:21.174 --> 22:24.093
Your attack?

22:24.135 --> 22:26.095
Well, i-it wasn't an attack.

22:26.137 --> 22:28.139
I-I just was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

22:28.181 --> 22:29.891

22:29.932 --> 22:33.186

Hector Barros.

I don't believe this.

22:44.947 --> 22:45.907
Hey, man.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.867
Whoa, okay, man.

22:47.909 --> 22:49.243
I have you.

22:49.285 --> 22:52.163

No, no. I was, I was saying,
in the story you were telling

that if a woman lies
to protect someone,

23:43.548 --> 23:48.386
that it would be worth it
if they were... best friends.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.473

It's the worst place,
though, to land.

44:20.575 --> 44:23.244
Because, at certain heights,
your coccyx snaps

44:23.286 --> 44:26.081
and pierces your kidney,
liver, and then your heart.

the secondary thing.
