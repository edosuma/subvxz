WEBVTT

00:09.533 --> 00:12.433
- YOU'RE GETTING SLEEPY.

00:12.467 --> 00:14.700
WHEN THE GREAT
"FRANKINI" SNAPS,

00:14.733 --> 00:17.400
YOU'LL NO LONGER
BE A GHOST DUCK.

00:17.433 --> 00:21.700
YOU'LL THINK YOU ARE
A FEROCIOUS GHOST DOG.

00:28.567 --> 00:31.567
THIS LOOKED EASIER
IN THE INFOMERCIAL.

00:31.600 --> 00:35.500
TAYLOR,
WHAT AN ATTRACTIVE OUTFIT.

00:35.533 --> 00:37.367
- YOU'RE NOT HYPNOTIZING ME.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.133
SORRY, BUT I'M TOO FOCUSED

00:39.167 --> 00:41.467
ON WINNING THE SCHOOL
TALENT SHOW WITH EMMA.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.233
FIRST PRIZE?
IMMORTALITY.

00:44.267 --> 00:48.700
OUR PHOTOS GO ON THE BULLETIN
BOARD BY THE BATHROOM.

00:48.733 --> 00:50.667
- HUGE.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.400
BUT TO ENTER THE TALENT SHOW,

00:52.433 --> 00:56.100
DON'T YOU HAVE TO HAVE--
HOW DO I PUT THIS NICELY--

00:56.133 --> 00:57.667
TALENT?

00:57.700 --> 00:58.733
- FRANKIE, PLEASE.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.400
I HAVE TALENT.

01:00.433 --> 01:03.200
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ME JUGGLE?

01:07.567 --> 01:11.567
I'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.533
- OH, GREAT.

01:14.567 --> 01:16.900
MORE JUGGLING.

01:21.233 --> 01:22.867
- I'M COUNTING CUSTOMERS,
TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T

01:22.900 --> 01:26.233
EXCEED THE MAXIMUM LIMIT
AS PERMITTED BY LAW.

01:26.267 --> 01:28.100
- SOUNDS FUN.

01:28.133 --> 01:29.667
- AND SAFE.

01:29.700 --> 01:31.667
OOH, TWO MORE.

01:33.267 --> 01:36.267
ONLY 28 PEOPLE AWAY
FROM MAXIMUM CAPACITY.

01:38.733 --> 01:40.467
- HEY!
LOOK AT THIS GUY.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.333
HE JUST STOLE
FROM THE TIP JAR.

01:42.367 --> 01:44.500
HE NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT
A LESSON.

01:44.533 --> 01:46.200
- STAND BACK, BABY BRO.

01:46.233 --> 01:49.400
I'VE GOT A LESSON
HE WON'T SOON FORGET.

01:53.667 --> 01:56.733
AND SERVED.

01:59.267 --> 02:02.433
- WE GET THE MONEY BACK,
AND HE LEAVES WITH A SMILE.

02:02.467 --> 02:03.633
EVERYONE'S HAPPY.

02:03.667 --> 02:04.900
- I'M NOT!

02:04.933 --> 02:06.400
DAISIES?

02:06.433 --> 02:08.500
LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW A REAL GHOST DOES IT.

02:08.533 --> 02:09.567
BAM.

02:12.467 --> 02:14.267
DANG IT.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.733
GOT MY MIND ON FLOWERS.

02:21.133 --> 02:23.233
- I HEARD BARKING.

02:23.267 --> 02:24.500
IT WORKED.

02:24.533 --> 02:26.700
I AM THE GREAT "FRANKINI."

02:34.667 --> 02:37.467
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

02:37.500 --> 02:40.333
* YOU GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

02:40.367 --> 02:42.433
- * SO IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

02:42.467 --> 02:46.400
- * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

02:46.433 --> 02:48.633
- * DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

02:48.667 --> 02:50.267
- * BUT I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL US *

02:50.300 --> 02:53.133
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:53.167 --> 02:55.800
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:55.833 --> 02:57.867
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:57.900 --> 03:01.700
*

03:01.733 --> 03:03.733
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

03:03.767 --> 03:05.933
*

03:12.567 --> 03:15.367
- I'M INSTALLING
A HAPPY DOORBELL.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.733
- AND THERE IT IS.

03:17.767 --> 03:20.700
- * WELCOME, FRIENDS,
WE'RE SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE *

03:20.733 --> 03:23.433
* WE ARE THE PRESTONS
AND WE WISH YOU GOOD CHEER *

03:23.467 --> 03:25.733
* LA, LA, LA, LA
PLEASE STAY AWHILE *

03:25.767 --> 03:30.267
* LA, LA, LA, LA
WE PROMISE YOU A SMILE *

03:30.300 --> 03:31.900
- THAT WILL NEVER GET OLD.

03:31.933 --> 03:35.167
AM I RIGHT?

03:35.200 --> 03:37.867
- DAD, ANY CHANCE I COULD
GET A NEW BROTHER?

03:37.900 --> 03:41.600
BECAUSE THIS ONE
IS NOT WORKIN' OUT.

03:41.633 --> 03:44.600
LOUIE,
MILES IS A FRIENDLY GHOST.

03:44.633 --> 03:46.900
YOU JUST NEED TO EMBRACE IT,
LIKE I HAVE.

03:49.267 --> 03:51.600
- * WELCOME, FRIENDS,
WE'RE SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE *

03:51.633 --> 03:54.267
* WE ARE THE PRESTONS
AND WE WISH YOU GOOD CHEER *

03:54.300 --> 03:56.633
I GOT TO GO.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.133
- NICE TUNE.

03:58.167 --> 04:00.533
IS THAT IN THE KEY OF LAME?

04:00.567 --> 04:03.167
- I WISH I HAD
A BADDER BROTHER.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.500
HE COULD TEACH ME
HOW TO BE A SCARIER GHOST.

04:05.533 --> 04:07.900
INSTEAD, I GET THIS GUY.

04:10.300 --> 04:11.933
- YOU DON'T NEED HIM.

04:11.967 --> 04:15.667
YOU HAVE THE GREAT
"FRANKINI."

04:15.700 --> 04:17.167
I STOPPED
DOING THE CAPE TWIRL

04:17.200 --> 04:19.533
AFTER AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT.

04:19.567 --> 04:21.600
- COULD THAT HYPNOTISM STUFF

04:21.633 --> 04:23.567
REALLY MAKE ME
A SCARIER GHOST?

04:23.600 --> 04:24.867
- ABSOLUTELY.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.667
- OH, YEAH.

04:26.700 --> 04:30.333
- YOU'RE GETTING SLEEPY.

04:30.367 --> 04:33.267
WHEN I SNAP,
YOU'LL BE HYPNOTIZED.

04:33.300 --> 04:37.467
AND YOU'LL BE THE BADDEST,
SCARIEST GHOST AROUND.

04:40.733 --> 04:42.767
- WHOA!

04:42.800 --> 04:44.800
I DO FEEL DIFFERENT.

04:44.833 --> 04:49.867
EVERYONE, KNEEL BEFORE ME,
AS I BREATHE FIRE.

04:54.833 --> 04:58.600
BUBBLES?
OKAY, I'M STILL THE SAME.

05:05.733 --> 05:09.733
- I AM THE BADDEST,
SCARIEST GHOST AROUND.

05:17.700 --> 05:20.733
IT'S GO TIME.

05:23.767 --> 05:26.567
- WHAT COULD GET US FIRST PLACE
IN THE TALENT SHOW?

05:26.600 --> 05:28.633
- I COULD SAW YOU IN HALF.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.333
- HEY, REMEMBER LAST WEEK
WE WERE MESSING AROUND

05:35.367 --> 05:38.167
WITH THAT DANCE THAT WAS
HALF HIP

05:39.367 --> 05:41.500
NO.
BUT I LOVE IT!

05:41.533 --> 05:42.800
LET'S DANCE.

05:42.833 --> 05:44.800
- SHH.
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

05:44.833 --> 05:46.600
I LOVE MY MOM,
BUT SHE TENDS TO GET

05:46.633 --> 05:49.100
OVERLY INVOLVED IN ANYTHING
PERFORMANCE RELATED.

05:49.133 --> 05:50.533
- NO PROBLEM.
- COOL.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.433
SO HOW ABOUT OPENING WITH--

05:52.467 --> 05:55.200
- HEY, GIRLS,
WHAT YOU DOIN'?

05:55.233 --> 05:56.567
- WHOA. IT'S ALMOST LIKE

05:56.600 --> 05:58.567
SHE KNEW WE WERE ABOUT
TO START REHEARSING

05:58.600 --> 06:01.167
THE DANCE YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
TO TELL HER ABOUT.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.500
- YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
TO FIND OUT

06:02.533 --> 06:03.933
YOU'RE DANCING
IN YOUR TALENT SHOW?

06:03.967 --> 06:06.167
- MOM, I'M SORRY, BUT--
- NO, SWEETIE, I GET IT.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.700
YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
TO HELP YOU GUYS,

06:07.733 --> 06:09.867
'CAUSE YOU THOUGHT I WAS
TOO BUSY WITH THE BAKERY.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.400
BUT YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER,

06:11.433 --> 06:13.400
AND I HAVE AN ONLINE
PERFORMING ARTS DEGREE.

06:13.433 --> 06:15.833
OF COURSE I WILL ADVISE YOU.

06:15.867 --> 06:17.300
- OKAY, 'CAUSE
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.467
- SOMEONE PUT ON
A POT OF COFFEE,

06:18.500 --> 06:22.667
I GOT A DANCE ROUTINE TO FIX.

06:22.700 --> 06:25.467
- UH, MOM, YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN OUR ROUTINE YET.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.467
- YEAH.

06:29.767 --> 06:32.167
YOO

06:32.200 --> 06:34.533
ONCE AGAIN, THE MUSES
HAVE BECKONED ME

06:34.567 --> 06:37.667
UPON THE SHORES
OF LAKE DANCE.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.733
- SOMETHING'S GOING DOWN.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.867
SHE'S GOT
THE CRAZY EYES GOING.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.800
- I WILL BE HELPING TAYLOR
LAUNCH HER NEW TALENT SHOW ACT,

06:44.833 --> 06:46.767
BUT NOT TO WORRY,
BECAUSE I LEAVE YOU

06:46.800 --> 06:49.600
IN THE CAPABLE HANDS
OF MY NUMBER TWO.

06:49.633 --> 06:52.267
CLEM!

06:52.300 --> 06:55.567
- OH. HEY, PHOEBE.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.633
- IT'S FRANKIE.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.500
- LET'S NOT DO THIS.
- OKEYDOKE.

07:00.533 --> 07:02.467
YO, MRS. H., CHECK IT OUT.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.233
COOKING GLOVES.

07:04.267 --> 07:07.467
THIRD DEGREE BURNS--
FOOL ME ONCE, AM I RIGHT?

07:07.500 --> 07:10.500
- CLEM
HAS MY FULL CONFIDENCE.

07:10.533 --> 07:13.533
KEEP HIM AWAY
FROM ALL SHARP OBJECTS.

07:15.300 --> 07:19.567
- HEY, THAT THIEF IS BACK.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.933
MAYBE A LITTLE FIRE ILLUSION
WILL SCARE HIM STRAIGHT.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.567
I THINK I SENT A MESSAGE.

07:32.600 --> 07:36.300
- YEAH.
"HAPPY NEW YEAR."

07:41.733 --> 07:44.867
- HEY, CHECK OUT THE HOG.

07:44.900 --> 07:47.733
35 HORSE.

07:47.767 --> 07:50.333
- MILES, ARE YOU
FEELING OKAY?

07:50.367 --> 07:51.600
YEAH.

07:51.633 --> 07:53.467
OH, I'M FEELING GREAT.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.567
'CAUSE I AM ABOUT TO GIVE OUT
A MAJOR BUTT KICKIN'.

08:10.667 --> 08:15.200
- MILES, YOU JUST
SCARED SOMEONE!

08:15.233 --> 08:18.233
- GET USED TO IT, BUTTERCUP.

08:28.900 --> 08:30.400
- NOTHIN'.

08:30.433 --> 08:33.767
I'M THE BADDEST,
SCARIEST GHOST AROUND.

08:33.800 --> 08:36.700
COLLAR UP.

08:36.733 --> 08:40.733
- LOUIE, I MUST HAVE
ACCIDENTALLY HYPNOTIZED MILES.

08:42.467 --> 08:45.267
I FINALLY HAVE THE BROTHER
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

08:48.133 --> 08:51.167
- HEY, PHOEBES, I'M HEARING
A LOT OF NOISE OUT HERE.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.433
I DON'T WANT TO
HAVE TO PULL RANK,

08:52.467 --> 08:54.133
BUT YOU NEED
TO KEEP IT CHILL.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.667
- YOUR HAT'S ON FIRE.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.100
- YEAH, I'M NOT UP
ON ALL THE KID LINGO,

08:58.133 --> 08:59.367
BUT THAT BETTER
NOT BE A SLAM.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.967
MY HEAD'S REALLY HOT.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.700
WE NEED TO STOP THIS.

09:14.733 --> 09:17.167
- NO WAY.
I LIKE THE NEW MILES.

09:19.533 --> 09:21.567
I HEARD SCREAMING.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.700
- MILES SUDDENLY
WANTS TO SCARE.

09:23.733 --> 09:26.733
CAUSED BY WHAT OR WHO,
I HAVE NO IDEA.

09:29.667 --> 09:32.367
- I DO.
IT'S ADOLESCENCE.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.800
COMES A TIME IN EVERY
TEEN GHOST'S LIFE

09:34.833 --> 09:36.233
WHEN HE WANTS TO REBEL.

09:36.267 --> 09:39.200
YO, SON, YOU GOT A SECOND?

09:39.233 --> 09:41.667
- OKAY.
OH, A SECOND'S UP.

09:41.700 --> 09:43.333
COME ON, BABY BRO.

09:43.367 --> 09:44.733
LET'S GO
SCARE THE PIZZA JOINT.

09:44.767 --> 09:47.600
OH, AND WE'LL CHAT LATER,

09:47.633 --> 09:50.500
AND YOU CAN TELL ME WHY
YOU THINK THAT HAT IS COOL.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.400
- OKAY, GIRLS.

10:01.433 --> 10:03.167
LET MY EXPERTISE
IN THE ARTS

10:03.200 --> 10:04.933
LEAD YOU TO VICTORY.

10:04.967 --> 10:06.533
AND BEGIN.

10:07.867 --> 10:09.167
YES.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.800
LOOK AROUND.

10:10.833 --> 10:12.567
SEARCH YOUR SURROUNDINGS.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.800
WHERE ARE YOU?

10:14.833 --> 10:17.400
HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

10:17.433 --> 10:20.500
- MOM, I'M CONFUSED.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.833
YOU WERE TWO DANCING TURTLES,
WHO EMERGED

10:23.867 --> 10:27.167
FROM THE CITY SEWERS,
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO DANCE.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.433
- YOU KNOW WHAT
COULD REALLY HELP US?

10:28.467 --> 10:29.833
COSTUMES.

10:29.867 --> 10:31.767
THAT WOULD DEFINITELY
GET US INTO CHARACTER.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.200
- GOOD INSTINCT, TAYLOR-SAN.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.700
I'LL GET TO WORK
ON THOSE A.S.A.P.

10:34.733 --> 10:38.167
YOU TWO, KEEP SEARCHING,
EXPERIMENTING.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.700
DON'T ACT THE TURTLE.
BE THE TURTLE.

10:45.467 --> 10:47.300
- SO HAVE WE COMPLETELY
ABANDONED THE IDEA

10:47.333 --> 10:50.333
OF ME CUTTING YOU IN HALF?

10:52.433 --> 10:54.700
- FRANKIE, YOU WON'T BELIEVE
THE DAY WE HAD.

10:54.733 --> 10:57.733
I COULD NOT BE PROUDER
OF MY BROTHER.

10:59.900 --> 11:01.933
OKAY, PROUDER!

11:03.633 --> 11:07.533
- YOU NEED TO PULL BACK
A NOTCH, MILES.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.233
- DON'T WORRY.
HE'S GONNA.

11:09.267 --> 11:12.600
SON, YOU AND I ARE GOING
ON A FISHING TRIP TOGETHER.

11:12.633 --> 11:14.900
ON IT, WE'LL DISCUSS
WHAT HAPPENS

11:14.933 --> 11:17.267
FROM A GHOST BOY
TO A GHOST MAN.

11:17.300 --> 11:19.233
- AW, DAD,
I'D REALLY LOVE TO,

11:19.267 --> 11:21.600
BUT HOW CAN WE FISH
IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY,

11:21.633 --> 11:23.433
UH, BAIT?

11:24.667 --> 11:28.467
WHERE'D IT GO?

11:31.333 --> 11:33.467
MILES, I'M GONNA--

11:33.500 --> 11:36.600
UNDERSTAND THIS IS
A DIFFICULT TRANSITION FOR YOU,

11:36.633 --> 11:40.233
AND WE'LL TRY AND CONNECT
AT A LATER TIME.

11:45.700 --> 11:48.167
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU JUST DID THAT TO DAD.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.333
- YEAH,
THIS NEEDS TO END NOW.

11:50.367 --> 11:52.733
WHERE'S MY HYPNOSIS WATCH?

11:52.767 --> 11:56.600
- DO YOU MEAN...
THIS?

11:56.633 --> 11:58.633
COME AND GET IT.

12:00.900 --> 12:03.500
JUMP, JUMP.

12:03.533 --> 12:05.500
KEEP LEAPING, FROGGY.

12:05.533 --> 12:08.300
- EASY, MILES.
FRANKIE'S OUR BUD.

12:10.433 --> 12:11.700
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:11.733 --> 12:14.733
HOW'S THIS?

12:16.667 --> 12:19.300
- MILES, YOU'RE NOT
BEING SCARY ANYMORE.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.400
YOU'RE SORT OF
JUST BEING A JERK.

12:21.433 --> 12:25.333
- UGH. THANKS FOR THE LECTURE,
GRANDMA.

12:29.900 --> 12:32.567
- THIS GUY HAS GONE
OVER THE LINE.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.600
I WANT MY OLD BROTHER BACK.

12:34.633 --> 12:36.700
DEHYPNOTIZE HIM, FRANKIE.

12:36.733 --> 12:38.733
- I CAN'T.

12:38.767 --> 12:42.433
- HE BETTER WATCH HIMSELF,
OR HE'S GONNA

12:42.467 --> 12:45.200
GET RUN OVER
BY THE PAIN TRAIN.

12:54.333 --> 12:57.467
- STUPID MILES,
MAKING ME LOOK LIKE A GRANNY.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.633
WAS THAT SUPPOSED
TO INTIMIDATE ME?

12:59.667 --> 13:00.967
I FEAR NOTHING.

13:01.067 --> 13:03.333
- RAAAH!
- AAH! EVIL BROTHER!

13:03.367 --> 13:04.800
AAH!

13:07.400 --> 13:10.567
- FATHER, A WORD, PLEASE.

13:12.733 --> 13:14.767
I'M SURE I DON'T HAVE
TO SHINE A LIGHT ON MILES'

13:14.800 --> 13:17.067
DISTURBING BEHAVIOR.

13:17.067 --> 13:20.233
- NO. BUT I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED A TOUGH,

13:20.267 --> 13:21.833
SCARY GHOST FOR A BROTHER.

13:23.433 --> 13:24.867
I'VE HAD A CHANCE
TO REFLECT ON THAT,

13:24.900 --> 13:28.067
AND I'VE DECIDED I DON'T.

13:28.067 --> 13:30.733
- IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
THIS BOOK,

13:30.767 --> 13:33.700
THE CONFUSING JOURNEY
OF TIMMY THE TEEN GHOST,

13:33.733 --> 13:36.667
IS FILLED WITH
SOME AMAZING INSIGHTS,

13:36.700 --> 13:38.967
AND A FEW WEIRD PICTURES.

13:39.067 --> 13:41.600
BUT IT'S GIVEN ME A WAY
TO ATTACK

13:41.633 --> 13:44.067
THIS MILES PROBLEM HEAD-ON.

13:47.733 --> 13:49.500
- * WE'RE THE PRESTONS
AND YOU BETTER BEWARE *

13:49.533 --> 13:51.800
* IF YOU ENTER THIS HOUSE
YOU'RE GONNA  *

13:51.833 --> 13:53.733
I NEED A COUGH DROP.

13:53.767 --> 13:55.267
- NOT AS CATCHY.

13:55.300 --> 13:58.333
- FRANKIE, DID YOU ORDER
ANOTHER HYPNOSIS WATCH?

13:58.367 --> 14:01.367
- YEAH, BUT IT WON'T COME
FOR THREE WEEKS.

14:02.900 --> 14:06.833
BUT I WANT MY BROTHER
BACK NOW.

14:06.867 --> 14:08.867
I MISS HIM.

14:08.900 --> 14:11.067
- MAYBE WE CAN TRY RIGGING
SOMETHING ELSE

14:11.067 --> 14:12.500
TO HYPNOTIZE HIM.

14:12.533 --> 14:14.567
WORTH A SHOT.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.767
LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.667
- OKAY, MY TINY ACTORS,
COMMENCE.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.533
*

14:31.567 --> 14:34.767
- * I'M COMING
OUT OF MY SHELL *

14:34.800 --> 14:38.300
- * I'VE GOT
A STORY TO TELL *

14:38.333 --> 14:39.800
- * AND I DON'T
WANT TO TALK *

14:39.833 --> 14:41.400
- * AND I DON'T WANT TO WALK

14:41.433 --> 14:46.800
both: * ALL WE WANT
TO DO IS DANCE *

14:46.833 --> 14:50.333
all: * DANCE

14:55.867 --> 14:59.333
- OKAY, GIRLS,
PERMISSION TO LAND...

14:59.367 --> 15:01.700
'CAUSE YOU JUST
SENT ME TO "PLANET WOW."

15:01.733 --> 15:04.633
OH.

15:05.933 --> 15:08.300
OOH.

15:08.333 --> 15:11.300
- EMMA, COULD YOU EXCUSE MY MOM
AND ME FOR A SECOND?

15:11.333 --> 15:13.333
- SURE.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.633
- WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND,
HONEY?

15:18.667 --> 15:21.400
- OKAY. WHILE I APPRECIATE
YOU MAKING TURTLE OUTFITS

15:21.433 --> 15:22.967
AND TEACHING US
HOW TO TAP DANCE,

15:23.067 --> 15:24.700
EMMA AND I KIND OF
HAD AN IDEA

15:24.733 --> 15:26.400
ON WHAT WE WANTED TO DO.
- OH.

15:26.433 --> 15:27.767
WHAT'D YOU WANT TO DO?

15:27.800 --> 15:30.567
- NOT PUT ON TURTLE OUTFITS
AND TAP DANCE.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.067
LOOK, MOM, MAYBE YOU
COULD LET EMMA AND ME

15:33.067 --> 15:34.667
FIGURE OUT A ROUTINE
ON OUR OWN?

15:34.700 --> 15:37.600
- I GET IT.
THIS IS YOUR TALENT SHOW.

15:37.633 --> 15:39.233
YOU NEED TO DO A ROUTINE
THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY.

15:39.267 --> 15:40.467
I'LL BACK AWAY.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.733
- THANKS, MOM.
THAT MEANS A LOT.

15:41.767 --> 15:43.933
I LOVE YOU.
- OH, I LOVE YOU TOO.

15:43.967 --> 15:46.933
- THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

15:46.967 --> 15:49.967
IT SMELLS WEIRD IN HERE.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.067
- SON, YOU AND I
ARE GOING SCUBA DIVING.

15:55.067 --> 15:56.500
PUT AWAY THE BIKE.

15:56.533 --> 15:59.833
- SORRY, OLD-SCHOOL...

15:59.867 --> 16:01.733
CAN'T PUT AWAY THE BIKE.

16:01.767 --> 16:03.300
IT'S PART OF ME.

16:03.333 --> 16:05.667
IT'S WHO I AM.

16:05.700 --> 16:07.633
- OKAY, I'VE HAD
ABOUT ENOUGH OF THIS.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.533
WE'RE GOING DIVING
AND HAVING OUR TALK.

16:09.567 --> 16:11.267
IT WORKED FOR
TIMMY THE TEEN GHOST.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.267
IT'LL WORK FOR YOU.

16:13.300 --> 16:16.067
- WELL, IF YOU
PUT IT THAT WAY...

16:20.567 --> 16:24.267
- THAT SHOULD KEEP HIM BUSY
FOR A WHILE.

16:24.300 --> 16:25.967
- YOU'VE WORKED SO HARD.

16:26.067 --> 16:29.067
EVERYONE'S GONNA LOVE YOUR
WHOLE GYMNASTICS HIP-HOP ACT.

16:29.067 --> 16:30.400
- THANKS FOR BEING SO COOL
ABOUT THIS.

16:30.433 --> 16:31.567
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE BUMMED.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.633
PLEASE.

16:32.667 --> 16:36.367
THAT'S SHOW BUSINESS.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.367
ALLERGIES.

16:38.900 --> 16:40.933
- HEY, MILES,
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

16:40.967 --> 16:42.567
- JUST DOIN' MY THANG.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.833
THAT'S RIGHT.

16:43.867 --> 16:45.733
INSTEAD OF THING,
I SAID THANG.

16:45.767 --> 16:47.467
DEAL WITH IT.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.233
- OKAY.

16:49.267 --> 16:51.067
WELL, TAYLOR AND EMMA
ARE GOING TO PERFORM

16:51.067 --> 16:52.367
THEIR DANCE ROUTINE
AT THE TALENT SHOW.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.600
YOU SHOULD COME WATCH.

16:53.633 --> 16:55.600
- MAYBE I'LL SWING BY.

16:55.633 --> 16:57.433
THEN AGAIN, MAYBE I WON'T.

16:57.467 --> 17:00.867
I'M UNPREDICTABLE
AND DON'T PLAN.

17:02.967 --> 17:04.967
- MILES, COME SEE
THE COOL TRICK

17:05.067 --> 17:06.533
FRANKIE'S BEEN WORKING ON.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.900
- I CALL IT,
"ROCKING THIS BACK AND FORTH

17:08.933 --> 17:11.933
WHILE YOU STARE AT IT UNTIL
YOU ENTER A TRANCE-LIKE STATE."

17:11.967 --> 17:14.767
- DON'T HAVE TIME.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.933
I GOT A TALENT SHOW
TO DESTROY.

17:17.967 --> 17:20.900
- WELL, I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE TIME.

17:20.933 --> 17:23.933
OH, REALLY?

17:32.633 --> 17:36.300
I WOULDN'T LET GO
IF I WERE YOU.

17:42.833 --> 17:46.300
FRANKIE...
I THINK I'M IN TROUBLE.

17:49.367 --> 17:51.700
THIS ISN'T GONNA FEEL GOOD!

17:55.267 --> 17:58.400
- OH, THAT'S GONNA
LEAVE A MARK.

17:58.433 --> 18:00.333
- THAT'S IT.

18:00.367 --> 18:02.600
WE'RE GETTING
MY BROTHER BACK.

18:02.633 --> 18:04.567
AND I THINK I KNOW HOW.

18:10.433 --> 18:12.233
- WE'RE UP NEXT.
YOU READY?

18:12.267 --> 18:13.667
- I WAS BORN READY.

18:13.700 --> 18:17.433
ACTUALLY, I WAS BORN
IN A BATHTUB.

18:17.467 --> 18:20.800
- I'LL JUST GO
GIVE THE D.J. OUR MUSIC.

18:24.367 --> 18:25.767
- LET'S SEE.

18:25.800 --> 18:29.367
HOW CAN WE HAVE SOME FUN?

18:30.933 --> 18:32.333
- BOO.
- AAH!

18:32.367 --> 18:33.767
WHO ARE YOU?

18:33.800 --> 18:35.633
- I'M YOUR REFLECTION,
AND I'M HERE

18:35.667 --> 18:37.933
TO TELL YOU TO BEAT IT.

18:37.967 --> 18:40.467
- O.M.G., I LIKE YOUR HAIR.

18:40.500 --> 18:43.433
HOW DO YOU GET IT
TO HAVE SO MUCH BODY?

18:43.467 --> 18:44.633
GAH!

18:47.633 --> 18:49.500
- TAY.

18:49.533 --> 18:50.667
- MOM, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

18:50.700 --> 18:51.967
WHERE'S EMMA?
- BAD NEWS.

18:52.067 --> 18:53.367
EMMA WAS LAST SEEN SCREAMING

18:53.400 --> 18:54.900
AND RUNNING
ACROSS THE PARKING LOT.

18:54.933 --> 18:57.767
BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO GO ON ANY SECOND.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.567
- I-I MAY HAVE
ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.600
I'M DESPERATE.

19:06.867 --> 19:08.400
YOU WANT TO DANCE WITH ME?

19:08.433 --> 19:09.633
- TRUE DAT.
- PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.

19:09.667 --> 19:11.700
- GOT IT.

19:11.733 --> 19:14.367
I KNOW I WAS A LITTLE
HANDS-ON BEFORE.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.300
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW,

19:16.333 --> 19:18.300
IF YOU NEED ME,
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

19:18.333 --> 19:19.467
- THANKS, MOM.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.867
I WOULD LOVE
TO DANCE WITH YOU.

19:21.900 --> 19:23.367
- MM.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.833
YOU GOT ME STRAIGHT TRIPPIN',
BOO.

19:24.867 --> 19:27.300
- SERIOUSLY, MOM.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.467
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THE GYMTASTICS!

19:36.533 --> 19:44.533
*

19:47.333 --> 19:48.733
- OH, NO.
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

19:48.767 --> 19:49.933
- I KNOW.

19:49.967 --> 19:53.633
MOM CANNOT
PULL OFF THAT OUTFIT.

19:53.667 --> 19:56.833
- NO, LOOK.
IT'S MILES!

19:56.867 --> 20:00.833
- WE HAVE TO STOP HIM
BEFORE HE RUINS EVERYTHING.

20:00.867 --> 20:04.500
ALTHOUGH...

20:04.533 --> 20:06.633
- SOMEWHERE DEEP INSIDE,
THIS GUY'S THE OLD

20:06.667 --> 20:08.300
SWEET MILES,

20:08.333 --> 20:09.900
AND I KNOW JUST THE WAY
TO BRING HIM OUT.

20:09.933 --> 20:12.233
MILES, STOP!

20:12.267 --> 20:14.733
- LOUIE, GET OUT OF HERE,
UNLESS YOU WANT A SHOWER.

20:14.767 --> 20:16.433
- NO. I'M NOT LEAVING HERE

20:16.467 --> 20:19.733
WITHOUT MY BROTHER,
MY REAL BROTHER.

20:19.767 --> 20:22.900
* WELCOME GOOD FRIENDS,

20:22.933 --> 20:25.467

20:31.033 --> 20:33.367
- LOUIE, STOP!

20:35.500 --> 20:37.767
'CAUSE I GOT "NEXTIES."

20:40.267 --> 20:42.567
* WELCOME, FRIENDS,
WE'RE SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE *

20:42.600 --> 20:44.833

20:44.867 --> 20:47.600
both: * LA, LA, LA, LA

20:47.633 --> 20:50.633
- * LA, LA, LA, LA
WE PROMISE YOU A SMILE *

20:53.567 --> 20:55.267
- WELCOME BACK, BROTHER.

20:57.300 --> 21:01.100
- FOR BEING YOUR BEAUTIFUL,
DORKY SELF.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.367
- YOU GUYS WANT TO GO
BACK TO THE HOUSE?

21:11.400 --> 21:14.400
- YEAH, I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
- LET'S GO.

21:21.333 --> 21:24.367
I AM DONE WITH
TIMMY THE TEEN GHOST.

21:25.933 --> 21:27.867
YOU AND I ARE GONNA
HAVE A TALK RIGHT NOW.

21:27.900 --> 21:29.300
SIT.

21:29.333 --> 21:30.667
- AWESOME!
I LOVE TO CHAT.

21:30.700 --> 21:33.633
- SAVE THE LIP.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.400
MILES, THERE COMES A TIME

21:35.433 --> 21:36.667
WHEN EVERY GHOST BOY
ACTS OUT.

21:36.700 --> 21:38.367
I'VE BEEN THROUGH IT MYSELF.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.267
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S GONNA STOP, GOT IT?

21:41.300 --> 21:44.833
- OKAY, POPS.

21:46.733 --> 21:48.267
NO BACKTALK?

21:48.300 --> 21:49.767
- OF COURSE NOT!

21:49.800 --> 21:52.800
INCOMING HUG.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.900
- I KNEW I COULD FIX THIS.

21:58.933 --> 22:00.567
OH, I'M GOOD.
