00:01.740 --> 00:03.133
- Previously on Nashville...

00:03.177 --> 00:04.830
- I didn'’t expect it to feel
so good up there.

00:04.874 --> 00:06.397
I'’m sorry, I'm gonna go.

00:06.441 --> 00:07.964
Those guys, they were
like my brothers.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.358
But they were okay. I was
never okay. I was weak.

00:10.401 --> 00:11.794
They shouldn'’t have sent
me over there.

00:11.837 --> 00:13.404
I was a danger to all of them.
- Stop it.

00:13.448 --> 00:16.494
- Welcome to Shiny New.
- To Alannah.

00:16.538 --> 00:18.061
- Pretty complicated
right now.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.410
- Because of Juliette.

00:19.454 --> 00:20.716
- Feels like
I'’m cheating on her.

00:20.759 --> 00:23.240
- I do not consent to
being kept here.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.676
She'’s a witness.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.461
They'’re gonna know
you helped me.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.071
I'’ll tell them George was
supposed to be watching you.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.681
- Si.

00:29.725 --> 00:30.943
- No problem.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.339
Are you helping me or what?

00:35.383 --> 00:36.819
- I'’m right here.

00:36.862 --> 00:38.038
- No, you'’re not.
What are you doing?

00:38.081 --> 00:39.604
- "Nashville'’s Next" website.

00:39.648 --> 00:41.650
All the fans are nicknaming
the contestants.

00:41.693 --> 00:42.651
It'’s brutal.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.088
- "Princess".

00:45.132 --> 00:46.133
- It'’s kind of sweet.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.525
- Maddie, it'’s not sweet!

00:47.569 --> 00:49.136
They'’re literally saying
the only reason

00:49.179 --> 00:50.833
I even got in the competition
was because of Mom.

00:50.876 --> 00:52.443
- Well, you'’ll win
and you'’ll show 'em.

00:54.097 --> 00:55.838
- There you are.
Hey, we gotta go to school soon.

00:55.881 --> 00:58.232
- Hello, hipster.

00:58.275 --> 00:59.668
- Don'’t start with me.

00:59.711 --> 01:00.973
- Are you opening up
for the Avett Brothers?

01:01.017 --> 01:02.540
- Okay, just stop it,
all right?

01:02.584 --> 01:04.586
I changed my wardrobe a little.
I gotta go through that.

01:04.629 --> 01:06.109
- I thought it was a radio show.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.590
- It is a radio show.
You know, an audience.

01:08.633 --> 01:10.070
A bunch of college kids
who wanna see how

01:10.113 --> 01:12.115
the old-timers used to do it.
- College, yep.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.900
- Yeah.
Playing my J160.

01:14.944 --> 01:17.033
- Yeah. I love what you
did with the wall.

01:17.077 --> 01:20.080
I kind of like it.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.124
Y'’all coming tonight?

01:21.168 --> 01:22.821
- Wouldn'’t miss it.

01:22.865 --> 01:24.040
- Yeah. I'’ll be pushing you
in your wheelchair.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.868
- Oh, I wanted to do that.
- Wait.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.043
Isn'’t this week
Dinosaur Appreciation Week?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.827
- Y'’all woke up
so funny today.

01:28.871 --> 01:30.612
Enjoy your walk
to school, Daphne.

01:30.655 --> 01:33.397
- Wait! I'’m ready!
- Let'’s go, Princess!

01:33.441 --> 01:36.096
- Oh, come! Do not!

01:36.139 --> 01:38.141
- Hey, man, do you know
anything about sinks?

01:38.185 --> 01:40.274
I woke up to
a clogged one this morning.

01:40.317 --> 01:42.406
- My wife had
a plumber out last week.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.060
I can ask her
who she used.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.453
- Oh, that'’s okay.
I'’ll ask my Uncle.

01:45.496 --> 01:48.195
It'’s his sink.
- Whatever you say.

01:48.238 --> 01:51.894
- Must be hard for her being out
there by herself with the baby.

01:51.937 --> 01:53.678
- It'’s not like
I don'’t see them.

01:53.722 --> 01:55.680
I'’m there three days a week
spending time with Jamie.

01:55.724 --> 01:57.160
- That'’s good.

02:00.076 --> 02:03.297
- All right, what'’s going on
in that devious head of yours?

02:03.340 --> 02:05.037
- Okay.

02:05.081 --> 02:08.040
Well, a friend of mine from
the Bluebird saw your set.

02:08.084 --> 02:09.999
Really liked it.
Wants to book you.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.094
- You are so great.
Would you just...

02:18.138 --> 02:19.704
Would you let something good
happen for yourself, please?

02:24.753 --> 02:26.407
- Yeah.

02:26.450 --> 02:29.453
Well, all right, thanks, man.
Just keep us posted.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.239
- Tall double-shot,
wet cappuccino.

02:32.282 --> 02:34.589
- Decaf.
- The Wildhorse bumped us.

02:34.632 --> 02:37.026
- Aw!
- I knew it.

02:37.069 --> 02:38.723
- We still got
the festival in Austin.

02:38.767 --> 02:40.856
- Not once they find out
about Alannah, we won'’t.

02:40.899 --> 02:42.553
- I thought you'’d be
happy right now,

02:42.597 --> 02:44.338
considering all your
complaints about her.

02:44.381 --> 02:47.123
- That was the steroids talking.
I actually kind of liked her.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.342
Now you tell us?

02:48.385 --> 02:49.952
Did you know
she was gonna bail?

02:49.995 --> 02:53.173
- No, but it would
be understandable

02:53.216 --> 02:54.391
if she was considering,

02:54.435 --> 02:56.611
you know, everything
that went down.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.134
- All right, yeah, here
we go again, it'’s all my fault!

02:58.178 --> 02:59.614
- I didn'’t say
it was your fault.

02:59.657 --> 03:01.093
- Because whatever I did,
dude, you did too.

03:01.137 --> 03:02.443
You just didn'’t tell me
you were doing it.

03:02.486 --> 03:04.445
- Do we have to go
through this again?

03:04.488 --> 03:06.098
- Well, I didn'’t sleep with her.
So don'’t say it was my fault.

03:06.142 --> 03:07.404
- Oh, no.
You just trashed her

03:07.448 --> 03:09.058
in your insane,
drug-fueled '’roid rage.

03:09.101 --> 03:12.148
Good name for an album.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.585
- Okay, all right, look.
We all screwed up.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.674
- Right. We all screwed up.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.589
- Yeah.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.200
But I only
screwed up a little.

03:21.679 --> 03:23.246
- Alannah,
you'’ve met the team!

03:23.290 --> 03:25.074
Team, you'’ve met Alannah.

03:25.117 --> 03:27.381
All right, so I won'’t waste
any time by saying the goal

03:27.424 --> 03:29.426
is to get you headlining
by next year.

03:29.470 --> 03:31.298
Which means we gotta
get you a following.

03:31.341 --> 03:32.255
Which means you gotta
record that EP

03:32.299 --> 03:34.126
as soon as possible, okay?

03:34.170 --> 03:38.130
But most important, we gotta
get you opening for somebody.

03:41.525 --> 03:42.961
You like The Lumineers?

03:44.572 --> 03:47.531
- Yeah.
They'’re going on tour soon.

03:47.575 --> 03:48.663
- Well, how am I gonna
open for The Lumineers?

03:48.706 --> 03:50.404
I'’m nobody.

03:50.447 --> 03:52.275
- Well, you know, I lock '’em
in a room with your demo.

03:52.319 --> 03:53.798
Make '’em listen to it.

03:53.842 --> 03:55.452
- I just downloaded
their new album.

03:55.496 --> 03:56.932
This is so surreal.

03:56.975 --> 03:59.326
- Oh, no.
It'’s very real, sweetheart.

03:59.369 --> 04:00.892
It'’s about to get even realer.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.810
- ♪ When the sun stops shinin'’ ♪

04:05.854 --> 04:08.248

04:08.291 --> 04:11.642

04:54.990 --> 04:55.947
- Thank you.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.819
- Yeah!

05:05.653 --> 05:07.307
- You know, Deacon, when
I think about you

05:07.350 --> 05:09.831
and the early days of
your career, it can'’t help

05:09.874 --> 05:12.616
but make me think about
the late great Glen Campbell.

05:12.660 --> 05:16.098
- Well, my friend, you know
how much that means to me

05:16.141 --> 05:17.621
because he'’s one
of my real heroes.

05:17.665 --> 05:19.406
It don'’t get better
than Glen Campbell.

05:19.449 --> 05:21.364
- Well, you know,
Glen, like yourself,

05:21.408 --> 05:23.366
found success as
a studio musician

05:23.410 --> 05:25.325
before he became a
successful solo artist

05:25.368 --> 05:27.588
which is finally
happening for you now.

05:27.631 --> 05:29.851
- He did it a little bit
quicker, a little bit bigger.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.156
But I do appreciate
your kind words.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.506
Thank you.

05:32.549 --> 05:34.377
- You'’re modest to
a fault, as always.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.379
Would you be kind enough to
honor us with another song?

05:36.423 --> 05:37.598
- I would be honored, yeah.

05:37.641 --> 05:38.947
One more time,
Deacon Claybourne,

05:38.990 --> 05:41.602
ladies and gentlemen!

05:41.645 --> 05:43.952
- I just wanted you to know
I would be first in line

05:43.995 --> 05:45.301
if you were ever do
a solo tour.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.650
- You might be the line.

05:48.435 --> 05:51.612
Thank you very much, though,
I appreciate it, very kind.

05:51.655 --> 05:52.569
Oh, okay.

05:55.877 --> 05:56.834
Okay.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.619
- Hello, Deacon.

06:00.969 --> 06:02.884
I was in town.

06:02.927 --> 06:06.366
Heard you were playing.
I wanted to say hello.

06:08.498 --> 06:10.413
- I gotta go.

06:10.457 --> 06:13.634
- I thought maybe we could...

06:13.677 --> 06:15.113
I thought maybe we could...

06:15.157 --> 06:16.811
- I'’m sorry, folks.
I gotta head out.

06:16.854 --> 06:19.379
Thank you very, very much.
I appreciate everybody.

06:19.422 --> 06:21.250
- Go and get a cup
of coffee or something?

06:21.293 --> 06:22.425
- Let'’s go.
Girls, come on.

06:22.469 --> 06:23.426
- Let'’s go!

06:23.470 --> 06:25.036
- Yes.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.648
- I'’m at the Super 8
by the Opry in case...

06:31.086 --> 06:32.566
- Nobody.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.273
- Hey!
- Hey!

06:46.362 --> 06:47.885
- How'’d that radio thing
go last night?

06:51.411 --> 06:52.977
"Oh, wow, Scarlett.
It was so good.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.544
Thanks for asking.
You'’re awesome."

06:56.372 --> 06:57.591
Deacon?

06:57.634 --> 07:02.422
- It was fine...
til my dad showed up.

07:02.465 --> 07:03.466
- Whoa.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.033
- Yeah.

07:05.076 --> 07:06.426
- I didn'’t even know
he was still alive.

07:06.469 --> 07:10.125
- Only the good die young.

07:11.387 --> 07:15.347
- I was about 17 or 18.

07:15.391 --> 07:18.438
He came back for
a little while after that.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.135
But it didn'’t get no better,
so I left.

07:20.178 --> 07:22.616
- Yeah, mama told awful stories.

07:22.659 --> 07:26.228
- That'’s the last damn thing
I needed right now.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.579
- I don'’t know,
don'’t care to know.

07:30.754 --> 07:31.668
- Hell, no.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.585
I don'’t want the girls
seeing him either.

07:35.629 --> 07:36.978
You know, while we'’re at it,
you stay away, too.

07:43.637 --> 07:46.727
What, Scarlett?

07:46.770 --> 07:47.902
- Ain'’t you the least
bit curious

07:47.945 --> 07:49.425
as to why he turned up now?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.079
- What, you mean what
kind of further damage

07:51.122 --> 07:53.385
he can inflict upon my life?
Not really, no.

07:55.387 --> 07:56.388
Enjoy your sink.

08:00.784 --> 08:03.221
- ♪ Thought it was gonna
be different this time ♪

08:03.265 --> 08:07.138
♪ I was on a road...

08:13.362 --> 08:15.756
- Well, after a day locked
in solitary confinement

08:15.799 --> 08:18.410
with your demo playing on a
loop til their ears bled,

08:18.454 --> 08:21.979
The Lumineers finally signed off
on you opening for '’em.

08:22.023 --> 08:23.633
- Get out.
- I am going out.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.026
It'’s a beautiful day.

08:28.682 --> 08:30.640
- Kate'’ll call and set up
a dinner so we can all meet.

08:30.684 --> 08:32.250
- I don'’t even know
what to say.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.296
- Oh, join us
for a drink later

08:34.339 --> 08:37.386
so we can toast
Shiny New'’s next big star.

08:41.477 --> 08:45.263
Drinks tonight

08:45.307 --> 08:48.136
- Look, you got nothing to
wor...would you get out here?

08:49.616 --> 08:51.095
Thank you.
You have nothing to worry about.

08:51.139 --> 08:52.662
Just a couple of songs.
You'’re gonna be great.

08:52.706 --> 08:54.534
- I can'’t remember the words
to the first line.

08:54.577 --> 08:55.883
- You'’ll remember the first
line when you get up there.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.145
And I'’m gonna
be right down here.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.412
- I invited her.

09:03.455 --> 09:06.284
- So she could see you.
See how far you'’ve come.

09:06.328 --> 09:07.895
- Yeah, you should
have asked first.

09:07.938 --> 09:10.114
I'’m probably just gonna
go up there and freak out.

09:10.158 --> 09:11.594
- Oh, you'’re not gonna
go up there and freak out.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.030
You'’re gonna go up there
and be fantastic.

09:13.074 --> 09:15.729
And I'’m sorry
I didn'’t ask first.

09:15.772 --> 09:18.209
- Next up, let'’s give
a very warm welcome

09:18.253 --> 09:20.037
to our very own
Sean McPherson!

09:21.299 --> 09:22.474
- Go on,
you'’re gonna be great.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.612
- Thank y'’all.

09:33.355 --> 09:35.662
I'’d like to give
a special shout-out

09:35.705 --> 09:37.315
to someone here tonight.

09:37.359 --> 09:39.666
Helped me through some
really tough times.

09:39.709 --> 09:43.757
She'’s the main reason
I'’m even on this stage.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.193
Miss Scarlett O'’Connor.

09:47.456 --> 09:50.633
- Scarlett, come sing
this with me.

09:50.677 --> 09:53.636
I know you know it.
I heard you humming it earlier.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.855
- This is your gig.
It'’s my night off.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.421
I'’m out.
- Come on.

09:56.465 --> 09:59.033
You pushed me up here.
So I'’m pushing you.

09:59.076 --> 10:00.817
- Okay.

10:17.704 --> 10:23.623

11:14.325 --> 11:15.587
- Thank you.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.027
Where'’s Kate?

11:20.070 --> 11:21.506
- Kate'’s not coming.

11:23.117 --> 11:24.727
I'’m the only label head
in town that can'’t

11:24.771 --> 11:26.642
get his employees to
slack off a little bit.

11:28.557 --> 11:31.299
Hey, to you and The Lumineers.

11:31.342 --> 11:32.779
- I still can'’t
believe it'’s happening.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.258
- They'’re the lucky ones.

11:34.302 --> 11:35.869
You gotta start
thinking like that.

11:35.912 --> 11:38.088
- I think it'’ll be
a while before I do that.

11:38.132 --> 11:39.524
- That'’s all right.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.091
I can be your
confidence for now.

11:42.658 --> 11:43.833
- I love this hotel.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.792
- I know.
I keep a room here.

11:45.835 --> 11:47.402
You know, for my artists
when they come to town.

11:47.445 --> 11:50.274
Or me if I'’m too tired
or drunk to drive home.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.712
You should see it.
The view'’s amazing.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.896
We gotta get you a stylist.

12:02.939 --> 12:04.767
Come up with some kind of
a look for you.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.638
Really?

12:06.682 --> 12:11.208
- Yeah.
Maybe pull your hair back.

12:11.252 --> 12:13.384
Let everybody see that
pretty face of yours.

12:15.517 --> 12:17.998
- You don'’t want my hair back.

12:18.041 --> 12:21.784
Trust me.
Looks terrible like that.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.351
- Whatever you say, darlin'’.

12:25.919 --> 12:28.399
We'’re gonna do great things
together, you and me.

12:28.443 --> 12:31.794
Yeah, but you'’re gonna have
to trust me.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.318
It'’s like any collaboration.
Come on.

12:34.362 --> 12:35.667
You know, I give a little,
you give a little.

12:35.711 --> 12:36.973
That'’s the way it
works, right?

13:15.882 --> 13:17.971
- Don'’t you talk
to me like that ever!

13:18.014 --> 13:20.060
Don'’t you ever talk to me!
Don'’t you do it!

13:20.103 --> 13:21.713
I swear I will kill you!

13:21.757 --> 13:23.628
- Gideon, stop!

13:34.988 --> 13:36.206
- It went very weird.

13:37.729 --> 13:39.862
- Weird like I should
have seen it coming.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.690
I'’ve seen a lot
of moves in my day

13:41.733 --> 13:43.735
and this might have been
the scariest.

13:43.779 --> 13:44.998
What did he do?

13:45.041 --> 13:46.347
- Nothing.
That'’s the whole thing.

13:46.390 --> 13:47.609
It'’s like one of
those movies where

13:47.652 --> 13:49.176
the Russians have a bug
in the room

13:49.219 --> 13:50.612
and the people have
to communicate

13:50.655 --> 13:52.875
without saying what
they actually mean.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.616
- I don'’t--
I don'’t get it.

13:54.659 --> 13:58.098
- It was completely obvious
that he was coming on to me.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.535
But if you had to play
a recording back,

14:00.578 --> 14:03.538
it would have seemed
completely innocent.

14:03.581 --> 14:05.279
- Wow...

14:05.322 --> 14:06.497
- I mean, I heard
about his reputation.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.021
I just,
I didn'’t think it was...

14:08.064 --> 14:10.197
I didn'’t think
it was about that.

14:14.505 --> 14:16.029
- Nothing.

14:16.072 --> 14:17.465
I mean, I was finding
it hard enough to believe

14:17.508 --> 14:18.858
it was even happening.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.948
I am gonna say
something, though.

14:21.991 --> 14:24.124
Tomorrow we'’re having
dinner with The Lumineers,

14:24.167 --> 14:28.345
so I'’m going to talk to him
about it before then.

14:28.389 --> 14:31.044
- Good.
Good for you.

14:34.482 --> 14:35.918
- Hi.

14:35.962 --> 14:38.703
May I speak with you
just a minute, please?

14:40.531 --> 14:43.230
- I can understand what
you might be thinking.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.928
I don'’t want your husband.
I don'’t.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.669
I just want to help him.

14:47.712 --> 14:52.152
Because you'’re
such a good person?

14:52.195 --> 14:54.850
- No, ma'’am, I'm a far cry from
the person I would like to be.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.248
- Come in.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.861
- I'’m just putting my baby down.

15:19.701 --> 15:22.356
- Your little one'’s precious.

15:25.315 --> 15:27.665
- Tea would be lovely.
Thank you.

15:39.721 --> 15:42.942
It can'’t be easy for you
not having his daddy here.

15:42.985 --> 15:46.249
- I almost wish
he would never come back.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.470
- At least then
I could grieve and move on.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.646
Instead, I'’m living
in this limbo.

15:51.689 --> 15:53.691
- What if I could get him
to come here a couple of days?

15:53.735 --> 15:55.345
Would you talk to him?

15:55.389 --> 15:58.087
- I'’ve been trying for a year.
It doesn'’t work.

15:58.131 --> 15:59.871
- He'’s changing.

15:59.915 --> 16:02.265
You saw him onstage
last night.

16:02.309 --> 16:04.876
Do you think he could'’ve done
that three months ago?

16:04.920 --> 16:08.054
Maybe you could take
a weekend together.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.925
- Do you know how many nights

16:09.969 --> 16:12.667
I held him when
he woke up screaming?

16:12.710 --> 16:15.931
I got so tired and depressed.
I could barely handle the baby.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.501
- No. I...

16:20.544 --> 16:22.938
I can'’t begin to imagine
what y'’all went through.

16:24.505 --> 16:27.203
- I'’m so sick and tired
of walking on eggshells.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.468
Afraid of what'’s gonna
set him off.

16:31.512 --> 16:36.560
- It'’s hard, but I think
it'’s worth hanging on

16:36.604 --> 16:37.822
just a little bit longer.

17:07.722 --> 17:10.072
- Well, good to see you, son.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.205
Come on in.

17:16.992 --> 17:18.776
Sorry it'’s not more fancy.

17:21.301 --> 17:22.302
Please sit down.

17:24.173 --> 17:27.089
- Listen, I know you'’ve
got a lot of hurt inside,

17:27.133 --> 17:28.569
a lot of anger...

17:28.612 --> 17:30.788
- Hey, you don'’t know
anything about me.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.794
- I didn'’t come here to fight.

17:44.541 --> 17:45.542
- Well...

17:48.545 --> 17:52.810
I been living in
Corpus Christi

17:52.854 --> 17:54.812
til Harvey came through.

17:54.856 --> 17:57.902
And took my house and
most everything I own with it.

17:57.946 --> 18:01.863
So I'’m kind of
starting over again.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.475
Here in Nashville?

18:05.519 --> 18:08.043
- Haven'’t thought
that far ahead.

18:08.087 --> 18:12.047
I know I'’ve got
grandkids here.

18:12.091 --> 18:17.661
You have two girls and
Beverly had that Scarlett

18:17.705 --> 18:19.446
who turned into such
a wonderful singer.

18:19.489 --> 18:21.274
Is that why you'’re here?

18:21.317 --> 18:22.231
Get some money?

18:24.146 --> 18:25.669
I can get you money
if you want money.

18:25.713 --> 18:28.368
- I didn'’t come here
to ask for anything.

18:28.411 --> 18:33.373
Except maybe to get
to know my family again.

18:36.376 --> 18:38.813
- You had 30 years to do that.

18:38.856 --> 18:41.163
- A lot has changed.

18:41.207 --> 18:44.949
I was very angry
as a young man.

18:44.993 --> 18:47.735
Maybe someday I'’ll be able
to tell you about that.

18:47.778 --> 18:50.346
That'’s all right. I'm good.

18:50.390 --> 18:53.219
- I did quit drinking.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.396
- I'’m gonna go.

19:00.008 --> 19:03.098
- I know I made mistakes.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.970
And missed out on
a lot of things.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.668
And that'’s on me to live with.

19:07.711 --> 19:11.237
- No. It'’s on me to live with.
And it was on Mom.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.847
And it was on
Beverly to live with

19:12.890 --> 19:14.109
because we had to live with you!

19:14.153 --> 19:15.328
We had to live not
knowing who

19:15.371 --> 19:17.068
was gonna walk
through that door,

19:17.112 --> 19:18.505
a father or a nightmare!

19:18.548 --> 19:19.897
That'’s what we had.
And then you left!

19:19.941 --> 19:21.899
- I understand that'’s
how you see it.

19:21.943 --> 19:26.469
- How we see... How we see it,
that'’s how we see it

19:26.513 --> 19:28.079
because it'’s how it was!

19:28.123 --> 19:30.299
You understand me?
It'’s how it was!

19:30.343 --> 19:32.954
- I can'’t make
the past any better.

19:32.997 --> 19:35.130
God, I wish I could!

19:35.174 --> 19:36.566
God help me, I wish...

19:36.610 --> 19:39.047
- What do you want
from me right now?

19:39.090 --> 19:40.353
What do you want?
You got cancer

19:40.396 --> 19:41.876
You need bills paid

19:41.919 --> 19:46.097
- I don'’t have cancer,
as far as I know.

19:47.577 --> 19:50.580
And I wouldn'’t ask you
to take me in.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.756
- No, you wouldn'’t do that.
You would just come back here

19:52.800 --> 19:54.845
and act like some sweet old guy

19:54.889 --> 19:56.282
and just hope everybody
forgets how things were...

19:56.325 --> 19:57.761
- Deacon...

19:57.805 --> 20:00.068
- Forget who you were,
forget what you did.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.810
It'’s never gonna happen.

20:02.853 --> 20:04.507
- Deacon...

20:04.551 --> 20:06.553
Just do it somewhere else.

20:06.596 --> 20:09.295
Because it'’s not gonna be here.

20:13.386 --> 20:16.302
- Sure, yeah, I'’ll have
my lawyer call your lawyer.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.218
Yeah, yeah, bring her in.

20:19.261 --> 20:22.395
I gotta call you back,
because I gotta call you back.

20:22.438 --> 20:23.700
That'’s why.

20:23.744 --> 20:26.573
Well, to what do
I owe the pleasure?

20:26.616 --> 20:27.704
- Well, Brad...

20:29.924 --> 20:31.534
- Look, I hope
you know how excited

20:31.578 --> 20:33.188
I am to be working with you.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.495
- As I am to be
working with you.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.714
- I just want to make sure
that there aren'’t

20:37.758 --> 20:41.762
any misunderstandings
between us.

20:41.805 --> 20:44.678
- Not sure what
you'’re referring to.

20:47.550 --> 20:51.772
- I just hope your interest in
me is entirely about the music.

20:54.949 --> 20:58.735
- Okay, now
I'’m really confused. I...

20:58.779 --> 21:02.261
I mean, should I bring in
a witness or is something...

21:02.304 --> 21:03.566
I don'’t know how you
would have gotten

21:03.610 --> 21:04.959
the impression
it was anything else.

21:05.002 --> 21:07.266
- Whatever you say.
- I do say.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.400
- Okay, then...

21:11.444 --> 21:13.315
- Look, my interest in you
is strictly professional

21:13.359 --> 21:16.187
because I think you'’re
an amazing performer.

21:16.231 --> 21:18.625
- Thank you.
I appreciate that.

21:22.237 --> 21:24.108
I hope this doesn'’t make
things awkward between us.

21:24.152 --> 21:27.677
- Look, I get it, I get it.
Times are changing.

21:27.721 --> 21:29.505
There'’s no room for
any kind of confusion

21:29.549 --> 21:31.333
about this kind of thing.
I get it.

21:31.377 --> 21:32.900
- Yes.
- That'’s fine.

21:32.943 --> 21:34.641
- Okay.

21:34.684 --> 21:36.338
- Yeah.
- Good.

21:36.382 --> 21:39.167
- All right. Thank you.
- You'’re welcome.

21:39.210 --> 21:40.821
- So I guess
I'’ll see you at dinner.

21:40.864 --> 21:42.344
- Can'’t wait.

21:42.388 --> 21:43.519
I'’ll have Kate call
with details, all right?

21:43.563 --> 21:44.912
- Perfect.
- Okay.

21:44.955 --> 21:46.653
- Thank you.
- You'’re welcome.

21:46.696 --> 21:48.350
- All right.
I'’ll see you tonight.

21:58.186 --> 22:00.231
- Why do you want me
to do this?

22:00.275 --> 22:01.885
- Can we not start
that again, please?

22:01.929 --> 22:03.800
- She kicked me out!
- She didn'’t kick you out.

22:03.844 --> 22:07.326
She lost heart, and so did you.
It'’s human.

22:07.369 --> 22:10.372
And you get to try again.

22:10.416 --> 22:13.680
And that'’s panic.
It'’ll pass.

22:13.723 --> 22:15.725
- I'’m an expert.

22:19.468 --> 22:22.036
Go in there and tell her
you'’re panicking.

22:22.079 --> 22:24.125
And she'’ll help you.

22:24.168 --> 22:26.127
- She doesn'’t understand it.

22:26.170 --> 22:28.347
- She can'’t understand
if you don'’t talk to her.

22:30.523 --> 22:31.785
Now get on in there.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.047
Your little boy'’s
waiting on you.

22:43.274 --> 22:46.626
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

22:51.935 --> 22:54.721
- Hi. A reservation for
Brad Maitland at seven?

22:54.764 --> 22:56.810
- I don'’t see anything.

22:56.853 --> 22:58.725
Could it be under
another name?

22:58.768 --> 23:02.511
Kate Roman?

23:02.555 --> 23:03.860
Or The Lumineers?

23:03.904 --> 23:05.906
- No, I think
I'’d remember that.

23:05.949 --> 23:08.474
- Oh, okay.

23:08.517 --> 23:09.736
- Oh, Kate.
Oh my God. Thank God.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.302
I thought
I had something wrong.

23:11.346 --> 23:14.567
- Hi. I'’m so sorry.
The dinner'’s off.

23:14.610 --> 23:17.091
Why?

23:17.134 --> 23:18.527
- Because the tour is off.

23:18.571 --> 23:20.094
It just happened an hour ago.

23:20.137 --> 23:21.965
- Wow.

23:22.009 --> 23:24.446
- It'’s the business, Alannah.
Things turn on a dime.

23:26.143 --> 23:27.710
- Right.

23:31.932 --> 23:34.021
How hard is it
for you to do this?

23:37.546 --> 23:39.548
- You know what, never mind.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.115
- We'’ll find something
for you, I promise.

23:41.158 --> 23:42.508
You just gotta give us time.

23:42.551 --> 23:44.335
- Uh-huh.

23:44.379 --> 23:46.990
- Brad moves mountains
for the people he likes.

23:55.216 --> 23:57.479
He'’s just living at
the Super 8 by the Opry?

23:57.523 --> 24:00.351
- That'’s what he said,
so I guess so, yeah.

24:00.395 --> 24:02.876
- I have no idea, sweetheart.

24:02.919 --> 24:05.095
- Are you just gonna
let him be homeless?

24:05.139 --> 24:07.010
- Yeah.

24:07.054 --> 24:08.359
- That'’s what I been trying
to tell you, all right?

24:08.403 --> 24:10.971
The idea of a home
never really meant

24:11.014 --> 24:12.712
too much to this guy, okay?

24:12.755 --> 24:14.757
I mean, people change.

24:14.801 --> 24:16.193
- Not him.

24:16.237 --> 24:17.934
If you'’d asked your
Aunt Beverly,

24:17.978 --> 24:19.980
she would have told you exactly
the same thing, am I right?

24:20.023 --> 24:21.590
- Yeah, she never had
a kind word for him.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.418
I mean, he could live and die...

24:23.462 --> 24:25.115
- Yeah, before we even meet him.
- Okay, listen to me.

24:25.159 --> 24:26.987
Did you know the man?
Were you raised by him?

24:27.030 --> 24:29.598
No, because I was, all right?

24:34.211 --> 24:36.083
You asked me what
was wrong, so I told you.

24:36.126 --> 24:38.389
Now I'’m kind of
wishing I hadn'’t.

24:38.433 --> 24:40.653
- Dad...
- Eat your food, please.

24:47.224 --> 24:48.443
- I mean, I'’m the one
that came up with

24:48.487 --> 24:50.097
the whole play group idea.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.533
The next thing you know,
Gail and Darcy

24:51.577 --> 24:53.970
are getting together
without me at the park.

24:54.014 --> 24:57.583
I mean, I'’m the one
who introduced them.

24:57.626 --> 25:00.150
And Gail did not
even like Darcy.

25:04.024 --> 25:05.939
It'’s just hurtful, you know?

25:08.681 --> 25:11.510
Sean?

25:11.553 --> 25:12.728
What is it?

25:23.609 --> 25:24.958
Honey...

25:40.887 --> 25:42.976
- Hey, Dad,
I learned a new song.

25:43.019 --> 25:46.022
Wanna hear?

25:46.066 --> 25:49.243
♪ Come and sit by my side

25:49.286 --> 25:52.768
♪ If you love me

25:52.812 --> 25:55.902
♪ Do not hasten to bid me

25:55.945 --> 25:57.643
- It'’s "Red River Valley".

25:57.686 --> 25:59.383
- It'’s just noise.

25:59.427 --> 26:00.689
- You sing it all the time.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.256
- Don'’t you backtalk me!

26:03.866 --> 26:05.259
- You leave the boy alone.

26:10.264 --> 26:11.613
- Of course, I am, yeah.

26:11.657 --> 26:12.745
- I'’m sorry if you
felt ganged up on.

26:12.788 --> 26:14.137
- No, no.

26:14.181 --> 26:16.139
- We didn'’t mean
to make you upset.

26:16.183 --> 26:17.227
And you
know I'’m not mad at you guys.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.402
Come on now.

26:18.446 --> 26:19.665
- We just thought it'’d be nice

26:19.708 --> 26:21.405
to have someone
new in the family.

26:21.449 --> 26:22.624
You know, after all this
loss that we'’ve been through.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.191
- Yeah, I get it.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.814
- I can'’t believe
it'’s been a year already.

26:38.858 --> 26:41.034
- Yeah, neither can I.

26:41.077 --> 26:42.775
- She used to make me so mad.

26:42.818 --> 26:44.603
So did you.

26:46.169 --> 26:47.257
So much so that
I didn'’t even want

26:47.301 --> 26:49.216
to be your daughter anymore.

26:49.259 --> 26:50.565
- I seem to recall that.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.310
- Can you imagine if I actually
went through with it, though?

26:56.353 --> 26:58.704
And we never
forgave each other?

27:00.314 --> 27:01.968
There'’s no way I could
live with myself.

27:02.011 --> 27:03.839
- Okay.
I get what you'’re saying, baby.

27:03.883 --> 27:08.844
I get it, I do,
and you'’re good.

27:08.888 --> 27:11.586
I just can'’t get past what he
and I have been through.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.196
I just don'’t got it in me.

27:15.155 --> 27:17.461

Thank you.

27:52.409 --> 27:55.195
- Great job.
- Awesome set, Alannah.

27:55.238 --> 27:56.283
- Thanks so much.

27:56.326 --> 27:57.588
- You were fantastic!

27:57.632 --> 27:59.373
- Thank you so much for coming.

27:59.416 --> 28:00.853
- Of course, I came.

28:00.896 --> 28:03.377
Can I have two Buds?

28:03.420 --> 28:06.336
Man your voice is so strong!
- Oh, thanks, yeah.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.729
Eh, the band was awesome.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.688
- So were you.
You were awesome.

28:09.731 --> 28:11.037
- Yeah.

28:11.080 --> 28:13.213
- Hey...
What is it?

28:13.256 --> 28:14.693
- The tour'’s off.

28:14.736 --> 28:17.957
What... What happened?

28:18.000 --> 28:20.220
- I'’m pretty sure
I'’m being punished.

28:20.263 --> 28:23.440
For speaking to him?
That'’s crazy!

28:23.484 --> 28:26.617
Look, you should
file a complaint!

28:26.661 --> 28:28.663
- Yeah, whatever.
Just as well.

28:28.707 --> 28:32.667
I didn'’t have enough material
for the tour anyway.

28:32.711 --> 28:36.018
- Well, uh...
Maybe I could help with that.

28:39.674 --> 28:41.894
- Wow.

28:41.937 --> 28:43.547
Well, what about
Gunnar and Will?

28:43.591 --> 28:45.288
I mean, they pretty much
want my head on a platter.

28:45.332 --> 28:47.595
- I don'’t even know
if there'’s a band anymore.

28:47.638 --> 28:49.728
I can still play with them
if we start up again.

28:51.642 --> 28:52.992
- Thank you.

28:53.035 --> 28:57.387
- Don'’t thank me.
You'’re amazing.

28:57.431 --> 29:00.521
- Well, I'’d be honored
to write with you.

29:05.091 --> 29:07.136
- Hang on!
Moving as fast as I can!

29:14.535 --> 29:18.713
- I'’m Maddie,
Deacon'’s daughter?

29:18.757 --> 29:20.802
- I know who you are.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.602
My dad would kill me
if he knew I was here.

29:41.605 --> 29:43.564
- You look so much
like your mother.

29:43.607 --> 29:44.913
- Thank you.

29:47.002 --> 29:48.221
It'’s been a
pretty terrible year.

29:50.832 --> 29:55.968
- So your dad told you
I was here?

29:56.011 --> 30:00.320
- I don'’t... I don't know what
happened between you guys.

30:01.887 --> 30:04.890
But I know it was bad.

30:04.933 --> 30:06.805
- It was bad.

30:06.848 --> 30:12.680
Not bad all the time
like he remembers, but...

30:12.723 --> 30:17.250
it doesn'’t much
matter now, I...

30:17.293 --> 30:19.818
I didn'’t hold up my end.

30:19.861 --> 30:23.430
So I guess he has every right

30:23.473 --> 30:26.172
to remember me as
bad as he wants.

30:27.608 --> 30:30.219
- You just don'’t
seem like that...

30:34.354 --> 30:38.010
- I probably was.

30:38.053 --> 30:39.881
The thing is,

30:39.925 --> 30:42.449
that was a long time ago.

30:42.492 --> 30:46.888
And getting old...

30:46.932 --> 30:50.196
Well, I don'’t recommend it.

30:51.893 --> 30:57.638
But it sure as hell
changes your perspective.

30:57.681 --> 31:00.075
- Maybe you should
tell him that.

31:00.119 --> 31:01.860
- He'’s not overly interested

31:01.903 --> 31:04.950
in anything I have
to say at the moment.

31:04.993 --> 31:06.865
- You remind me of him.

31:12.305 --> 31:17.049
- I'’m sure he's a...

31:17.092 --> 31:20.226
He'’s a much better man
than I ever was.

31:24.621 --> 31:27.276
What, child?

31:27.320 --> 31:32.760
- Besides me and
my sister and Scarlett,

31:32.803 --> 31:35.545
you'’re the only family
he has left.

31:45.338 --> 31:47.731
- I am gonna get better.
- I know.

31:47.775 --> 31:49.081
I mean, I just gotta
figure out what I'’m gonna do

31:49.124 --> 31:51.039
in the meantime.

31:51.083 --> 31:52.432
I mean, we can still write.

31:52.475 --> 31:54.477
- Yeah, we could do that.
- Yeah, okay.

31:54.521 --> 31:56.044
Well, how about we do
a session tonight?

31:56.088 --> 31:57.567
- I'’m in.

31:57.611 --> 31:59.656
- Um...

32:01.397 --> 32:05.924
- I kind of agreed to write
with someone else tonight.

32:10.972 --> 32:13.322
- Alannah...

32:13.366 --> 32:15.063
- Mmm.

32:15.107 --> 32:17.718
- I think it was Alannah.

32:17.761 --> 32:19.198
- You'’re a real friend,
Avery, you know that?

32:19.241 --> 32:20.808
- Come on.
Here we go again.

32:20.851 --> 32:22.984
Well, you said that you
could handle me being with her.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.072
- Yeah, but I didn'’t
say anything about you

32:24.116 --> 32:25.595
leaving us to go
play with her.

32:25.639 --> 32:26.596
- Well, I'’m not playing
with her.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.033
I'’m writing with her.

32:28.076 --> 32:29.512
If that'’s a problem,
I won'’t do it.

32:29.556 --> 32:30.992
Go do it, man.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.689
Because you'’re
gonna do it anyway.

32:32.733 --> 32:35.040
- Gunnar, come on, man.
Let'’s talk about this!

32:42.308 --> 32:44.223
- Hey, sweetie.
What'’s up?

32:44.266 --> 32:46.790
- Can you promise to have
an open mind about this?

32:54.363 --> 32:56.104
- Hello, son.

32:56.148 --> 32:58.193
- Please don'’t be mad.
I just want you guys to talk.

32:58.237 --> 33:01.240
- Maddie...

33:01.283 --> 33:02.806
- You had no damn right
going to her.

33:02.850 --> 33:05.244
- She came to me.

33:07.289 --> 33:10.075
It'’s all right.
I'’m leaving.

33:10.118 --> 33:12.468
You don'’t want me here.
I get it.

33:12.512 --> 33:14.209
- What do you expect
me to want?

33:14.253 --> 33:16.429
- I don'’t expect
anything, Deacon.

33:16.472 --> 33:21.303
I hoped, I don'’t know,
in spite of everything that...

33:21.347 --> 33:24.045
there was a chance
we could start over.

33:29.964 --> 33:32.445
There was never a start.

33:32.488 --> 33:35.056
I never had a father.
You understand me?

33:35.100 --> 33:36.449
You understand that?

33:36.492 --> 33:38.016
- You had a father!
I was your father!

33:38.059 --> 33:39.582
- You raise your voice
to me again,

33:39.626 --> 33:41.280
I'’ll have you escorted
out of this building.

33:41.323 --> 33:42.411
- Oh, sure...

33:43.760 --> 33:45.371
I'’m sorry. I...

33:47.025 --> 33:48.330
Didn'’t come here to fight.

33:48.374 --> 33:51.594
- So you keep telling me.

33:51.638 --> 33:53.727
- You'’re a powerful
man now, Deacon.

33:53.770 --> 33:55.250
I'’m glad to see it.

33:55.294 --> 33:56.643
- Yeah, well, whatever
the hell that means.

33:56.686 --> 33:58.036
You had nothing to do with it.

33:58.079 --> 34:00.560
- It means I can'’t hurt
you anymore.

34:00.603 --> 34:04.999
I'’m an old man,
but I was a father to you

34:05.043 --> 34:07.001
whether you remember
it or not.

34:09.612 --> 34:12.354
But I was...

34:12.398 --> 34:14.052
I was a drunk

34:17.055 --> 34:19.361
with a mean streak
a mile wide

34:19.405 --> 34:23.757
because I hated my life and
everything I'’d done with it.

34:26.325 --> 34:29.154
So I took it out on
everyone around me.

34:31.721 --> 34:36.596
For which I'’m sure
I'’ll be damned.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.772
- Open the door!
- Get away from me!

34:38.815 --> 34:40.208
Just go away for the night.

34:40.252 --> 34:42.602
- Get away from her!
- Leave me alone!

34:42.645 --> 34:44.212
- Get away from her, Dad!

34:45.866 --> 34:49.174
- Oh, big man.

34:49.217 --> 34:51.524
- Get away from her
and don'’t ever come back.

34:54.396 --> 35:00.054
- And I knew I was
damned the night I left.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.798
Saw it in your eyes, the hate.

35:04.841 --> 35:08.018
You were becoming me.

35:10.673 --> 35:14.808
And whatever else I did,

35:14.851 --> 35:17.332
I wasn'’t gonna
let that happen.

35:20.901 --> 35:22.424
- Yeah, well, it did anyway.

35:25.035 --> 35:27.734
- No, you didn'’t become me.

35:31.041 --> 35:33.392
You wouldn'’t have all this.

35:33.435 --> 35:36.482
All...

35:36.525 --> 35:38.179
All these people who love you.

35:54.848 --> 35:57.546
- Scarlett.
Please, I don'’t know what to do.

35:58.939 --> 36:00.506
- Sean'’s locked himself
in the bathroom.

36:00.549 --> 36:01.768
He'’s got a gun.

36:05.075 --> 36:07.034
- Please... he'’s in there.

36:07.077 --> 36:09.079
- Okay.
- Thank you.

36:09.123 --> 36:10.168
- It'’s all right.
- He'’s in here.

36:18.654 --> 36:20.003
Sean, it'’s Scarlett.

36:23.616 --> 36:25.270
Sean, come on.
Let us hear your voice.

36:25.313 --> 36:26.923
Let us know you'’re all right.

36:26.967 --> 36:28.229
- He was doing better than me.

36:30.057 --> 36:33.234
- Derek.
He just got a promotion.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.454
His wife was pregnant again.

36:35.497 --> 36:37.064
- Platoon sergeant.

36:40.676 --> 36:44.289
- Sean, would you
please come out

36:44.332 --> 36:47.770
so we can all talk, please?

37:01.349 --> 37:03.351
Tell me what happened
to Derek, Sean.

37:04.613 --> 37:05.484
- Hung himself.

37:05.527 --> 37:06.963
- Oh, Sean.

37:07.007 --> 37:08.574
- From his kid'’s
treehouse out back.

37:08.617 --> 37:09.836
- My God...

37:09.879 --> 37:11.707
- He taught me
everything I know.

37:11.751 --> 37:15.320
Saved my life
I don'’t know how many times.

37:15.363 --> 37:18.801
If he couldn'’t make it,
how can I?

37:18.845 --> 37:22.065
- I didn'’t know him,
Sean, but I know you.

37:22.109 --> 37:25.243
I know what you'’re made of.

37:25.286 --> 37:26.592
- I should just do it.

37:26.635 --> 37:28.115
- No, no, no, no!
Please, please, please!

37:28.158 --> 37:30.204
- Every time things
start getting better,

37:30.248 --> 37:32.815
it just grabs me again.

37:32.859 --> 37:34.817
Tell me what grabs you.

37:34.861 --> 37:36.558
- These images in my head.

37:36.602 --> 37:40.301
They... They go over and over.

37:40.345 --> 37:42.434
And they won'’t stop
and I can'’t make 'em.

37:42.477 --> 37:45.480
- Please put the gun down.
Sean, please.

37:45.524 --> 37:47.613
- I just want everything
to go back to normal again!

37:47.656 --> 37:50.790
- It can be normal,
I swear it can.

37:50.833 --> 37:54.794
It'’s just...
It'’s a different kind of normal.

37:54.837 --> 37:57.100
It'’s normal you can live with.

37:58.754 --> 38:00.147
- I don'’t know.

38:00.190 --> 38:01.757
I'’m scared out of
my mind right now.

38:11.811 --> 38:12.812
Hey, Sean, what...

38:17.033 --> 38:20.776
What do you feel
right now in this moment?

38:23.953 --> 38:26.695
You feel the air go in
and out your lungs?

38:29.394 --> 38:32.614
- Feel the breeze
on your face?

38:32.658 --> 38:36.052
- I don'’t... I don't care
about a breeze on my face.

38:36.096 --> 38:37.619
- Well, I'’m asking you.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.578
Do you feel
the breeze on your face?

38:39.621 --> 38:42.537
- I feel a stupid
breeze on my face.

38:45.627 --> 38:47.760
- Then you don'’t have
to kill yourself.

38:52.591 --> 38:54.027
- Because it feels good.

38:55.855 --> 38:57.639
- Nothing feels good.

38:57.683 --> 38:59.554
- I know.
It goes away so fast.

38:59.598 --> 39:01.991
But it was there for a moment.

39:02.035 --> 39:03.645
You felt it yourself.

39:03.689 --> 39:05.343
And if it can be there
for one moment,

39:05.386 --> 39:08.302
it could be there for two,
three, or a lifetime even.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.825
- But these images,
they come back in my head.

39:09.869 --> 39:11.436
They'’re already back.

39:11.479 --> 39:13.046
- I know, and you'’re
gonna talk about '’em.

39:13.089 --> 39:14.395
You keep talking about
'’em to me, to Angela.

39:14.439 --> 39:15.875
To anybody who'’ll listen.

39:15.918 --> 39:19.400
Because it'’s gonna get better.

39:19.444 --> 39:22.229
I swear to you it was
already getting better.

39:22.272 --> 39:26.494
There are still gonna be days
when you just feel awful.

39:26.538 --> 39:32.370
But each time the awful
will get less.

39:32.413 --> 39:34.197
Better will get more.

- Huh, you'’re not half bad.
- Right back at you.
