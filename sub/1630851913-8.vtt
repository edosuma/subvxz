<i>-Mmm.</i>

01:04.230 --> 01:05.440
<i>[Neto] Uh…</i>

01:05.523 --> 01:07.942
<i>Takes shit too seriously.</i>

<i>He's got ideas.</i>

01:10.987 --> 01:12.197
<i>Like what…</i>

<i>Organizing the plazas…</i>

<i>to sell their weed together.</i>

<i>One big organization…</i>

01:29.631 --> 01:32.383
<i>Smart. Who knows?</i>

<i>Two of you. With the big ideas.</i>

01:36.054 --> 01:39.224
<i>What? We can grow, get bigger…</i>

01:40.100 --> 01:41.935
<i>Bigger' gets you locked up.</i>

<i>[theme song playing]</i>

<i>[Andréa in English] </i>In December of 1994,
it all fell apart.

04:45.243 --> 04:50.206
<i>For years, Mexico's Harvard-educated</i>
<i>president was admired in the US.</i>

04:50.290 --> 04:51.874
<i>He'd signed NAFTA,</i>

04:51.958 --> 04:54.460
<i>brought American-style</i>
<i>consumerism to Mexico,</i>

04:54.544 --> 04:57.672
<i>pulled in billions</i>
<i>of foreign investment dollars.</i>

04:57.755 --> 05:01.217
<i>With his term ending and a successor</i>
<i>chosen by party bosses,</i>

05:01.301 --> 05:03.469
<i>the president's popularity soared.</i>

05:03.553 --> 05:05.430
<i>On both sides of the border.</i>

05:05.513 --> 05:08.808
<i>But the high didn't last,</i>
<i>because it was all a lie.</i>

05:08.891 --> 05:12.061
<i>There had been signs of economic trouble.</i>

05:12.145 --> 05:14.397
<i>But devaluing the peso</i>
<i>would have raised questions</i>

05:14.480 --> 05:16.983
<i>about the man who modernized Mexico.</i>

05:17.066 --> 05:18.192
<i>So he did nothing.</i>

05:18.276 --> 05:21.738
<i>A week after he left office,</i>
<i>it all came crashing down.</i>

05:21.821 --> 05:24.741
<i>[in Spanish] What began</i>
<i>as a dream full of hope</i>

05:24.866 --> 05:27.535
<i>ended in an awakening</i>
<i>to the abrupt reality of problems.</i>

05:27.618 --> 05:30.038
<i>A sudden devaluation of the peso</i>

05:30.121 --> 05:34.000
<i>that we had not known since 1987</i>
<i>presents us a new reality.</i>

05:34.667 --> 05:38.087
<i>[Andréa in English] </i>Almost overnight,
our currency lost half its value.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.214
<i>A million Mexicans lost their jobs.</i>

05:40.298 --> 05:43.551
<i>An entire generation's</i>
<i>life savings got wiped out.</i>

05:43.634 --> 05:45.720
<i>Even the rich felt it.</i>

05:45.803 --> 05:47.096
<i>Sort of.</i>

05:48.514 --> 05:49.640
<i>RESPECT WORKERS' RIGHTS</i>

05:49.724 --> 05:52.101
<i>For the middle class,</i>
<i>it was the end of a dream.</i>

05:52.185 --> 05:55.521
<i>For the poor, something worse.</i>

05:55.605 --> 05:57.523
<i>We all faced a new reality.</i>

05:57.607 --> 06:01.110
<i>But as usual,</i>
<i>the pain wouldn't be shared equally.</i>

06:01.194 --> 06:02.987
<i>[Manny in Spanish] This shit's terrible…</i>

06:03.071 --> 06:04.030
<i>[Corral] It is?</i>

06:05.073 --> 06:07.367
<i>Our business is all American dollars…</i>

06:11.162 --> 06:13.831
<i>Our value just doubled, Manny.</i>

06:16.417 --> 06:18.294
<i>This makes us bigger.</i>

06:21.339 --> 06:22.840
<i>[Amado over phone]</i>
You knew this was coming?

06:23.466 --> 06:26.677
<i>We knew it was bad. Not like this.</i>

06:28.096 --> 06:31.224
<i>The President let his friends down…</i>

06:31.808 --> 06:33.434
<i>It won't go unaddressed.</i>

06:34.811 --> 06:37.980
<i>Good time to be in a cash business.</i>

06:38.064 --> 06:40.900
<i>[Amado] </i>Americans always need drugs.

06:40.983 --> 06:44.821
<i>With all this turbulence -</i>

06:46.614 --> 06:49.700
<i>It's important those dollars</i>
<i>keep flowing.</i>

06:50.368 --> 06:53.538
<i>I know changes are coming in Colombia -</i>

<i>You asking about my side of the business?</i>

07:00.628 --> 07:03.548
<i>Thought I didn't have one.</i>

07:07.301 --> 07:13.516
<i>I'm making sure there won't be</i>
<i>any supply issues for our business.</i>

07:17.145 --> 07:20.898
<i>I'll talk to Henao.</i>
<i>Make sure it's all solid…</i>

07:21.691 --> 07:22.900
<i>Get back to me with what he says.</i>

07:23.651 --> 07:25.445
<i>I want assurances, yeah?</i>

07:27.697 --> 07:29.449
<i>All the dollars you're holding…</i>

07:29.532 --> 07:32.243
<i>You're the richest trafficker</i>
<i>in the history of Mexico.</i>

07:33.202 --> 07:34.454
<i>Maybe the world.</i>

07:36.914 --> 07:38.416
<i>Just hope it lasts. Right?</i>

07:39.750 --> 07:40.751
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

07:55.266 --> 07:58.311
<i>[door opens and closes]</i>

<i>[Káren] Thanks for meeting me…</i>

<i>How're you doing, Káren?</i>

08:10.823 --> 08:13.075

<i>-[door closes]</i>

08:25.755 --> 08:28.174
<i>…Last February,</i>
<i>the President held a private dinner</i>

08:28.257 --> 08:30.468
<i>for 30 of the richest men in Mexico…</i>

08:32.053 --> 08:34.764
<i>Told them they were gonna</i>
<i>fund the PRI's expenses.</i>

08:35.598 --> 08:36.807
<i>He wasn't asking.</i>

08:38.059 --> 08:39.519
<i>I heard about this…</i>

08:41.229 --> 08:44.106
<i>That was the problem. It got out.</i>

08:45.608 --> 08:47.735
<i>So he backpedaled…</i>

08:50.738 --> 08:52.698
<i>But then we started hearing rumors.</i>

08:53.407 --> 08:56.327
<i>The party had a new cash supply…</i>

08:58.204 --> 08:59.664
<i>An "unofficial" one.</i>

09:01.332 --> 09:02.750
<i>Like a slush fund?</i>

09:06.087 --> 09:08.214
<i>With over 700 million dollars in it.</i>

09:09.215 --> 09:12.051
<i>Money's for campaigns,</i>
<i>bribes, investments…</i>

09:13.469 --> 09:14.679
<i>buying power.</i>

09:17.139 --> 09:18.599
<i>Where'd the cash come from?</i>

09:20.393 --> 09:22.270
<i>From anyone who wanted access.</i>

09:22.937 --> 09:24.897
<i>Businessmen, of course.</i>

09:30.194 --> 09:31.737
<i>But also traffickers.</i>

09:32.822 --> 09:35.825
<i>Mexican cartels,</i>
<i>Colombians too. Supposedly.</i>

09:37.326 --> 09:38.869
<i>This slush fund. Who controlled it?</i>

09:42.873 --> 09:44.375
<i>Carlos Hank Gonzaléz…</i>

09:46.711 --> 09:48.963
<i>[soldiers speaking indistinctly]</i>

09:55.344 --> 09:57.013
<i>Luis Colosio was my friend.</i>

09:58.222 --> 09:59.640
<i>What's this for you?</i>

10:00.600 --> 10:03.060
<i>Why do you want Hank so badly?</i>

10:04.770 --> 10:05.938
<i>He's corrupt.</i>

10:06.981 --> 10:08.065
<i>So are a lot of men…</i>

10:11.068 --> 10:12.903
<i>Hank represents the system.</i>

10:14.155 --> 10:15.698
<i>Nothing touches them.</i>

10:16.407 --> 10:18.701
<i>The truth never sticks,</i>
<i>so nothing changes.</i>

10:20.119 --> 10:20.995
<i>I don't know…</i>

10:23.289 --> 10:26.334
<i>At some point</i>
<i>the bad guys have to lose, right?</i>

10:30.671 --> 10:32.340
<i>So, this slush fund…</i>

10:34.508 --> 10:37.178
<i>Think you could find proof it exists?</i>

10:42.808 --> 10:45.686
<i>A friend in party finances</i>
<i>gave me these…</i>

10:47.229 --> 10:49.815
<i>There's others who want things to change.</i>

10:51.233 --> 10:52.652
<i>I don't know what's in them.</i>

10:53.444 --> 10:56.822
<i>But if anything can tie Hank</i>
<i>to dirty money - it starts here.</i>

11:00.534 --> 11:02.119
<i>I went to law school…</i>

11:03.454 --> 11:04.955
<i>So did I…</i>

<i>-Didn't finish.</i>
<i>-[Káren chuckles]</i>

<i>especially not on the phone…</i>

<i>I don't talk to anyone anymore.</i>

11:25.309 --> 11:27.895
<i>[Andréa in English] </i>It felt like

<i>The new task force you're liaising with.</i>

12:18.320 --> 12:19.989
<i>[Walt] </i>Just what's in my report, sir.

<i>There's a woman at the consulate in TJ.</i>

<i>She's making noise.</i>

12:27.204 --> 12:29.373
<i>She claims the Mexican army took her son.</i>

12:29.457 --> 12:31.417
<i>Says he's an American citizen.</i>

12:32.293 --> 12:34.295
<i>You wouldn't know anything</i>
<i>about that, would you, Walt?</i>

<i>I want something different now.</i>

54:34.437 --> 54:35.480
<i>With you.</i>

54:37.899 --> 54:43.029
<i>Escobar, Félix, the Cali guys…</i>
<i>All thought they had more time.</i>

54:43.113 --> 54:44.572
<i>They were wrong.</i>

54:46.950 --> 54:48.576
<i>If I'm careful, do it right…</i>

54:49.828 --> 54:51.997
<i>I can start over.</i>

54:59.296 --> 55:01.214
<i>I'm getting out.</i>

55:03.383 --> 55:06.219
<i>You want that, to start over?</i>

55:08.263 --> 55:09.306
<i>Yes…</i>

55:10.640 --> 55:11.766
<i>I do.</i>

55:40.795 --> 55:42.797
