00:00.475 --> 00:02.032
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:02.187 --> 00:04.086
I don't wanna stop tutoring with Adam.

00:04.122 --> 00:06.675
You'll still be able to focus on your work,
right?

00:06.873 --> 00:09.125
- Mom!
- I'm just saying...

00:09.160 --> 00:11.294
Maybe you have feelings for him.

00:11.329 --> 00:13.462
Wow! Are those all your matches?

00:18.236 --> 00:21.720
- Hi. Lou, right?
- You must be Mitch.

00:21.918 --> 00:24.473
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:24.509 --> 00:26.842
I think we're both looking for
different things right now.

00:32.089 --> 00:34.983
Oh wow, Amy's pregnant.

For crying out loud.

01:04.447 --> 01:07.448
What the hell's going on here?

01:11.220 --> 01:14.055
Easy, easy, easy...

01:25.414 --> 01:27.327
Okay.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.539
- Hey.
- Hey!

01:32.575 --> 01:33.661
What was that for?

01:33.727 --> 01:35.708
Nothing. It's just good to have you home.

01:40.996 --> 01:42.715
Knock, knock.

01:42.750 --> 01:44.417
- Hey, man!
- Welcome back.

01:44.453 --> 01:46.353
Thanks! Conference ended yesterday.

01:46.388 --> 01:48.054
Scott and I drove in last night, so...

01:48.090 --> 01:49.456
I've got beers at the trailer.

01:49.491 --> 01:50.857
Why don't you come by and indulge?

01:50.892 --> 01:52.825
Sorry, man, I can't.
Between the hours at the clinic

01:52.861 --> 01:54.760
and catching up on the
business here with Amy, I'm...

01:54.796 --> 01:57.196
Ooh!
Speaking of Amy, actually...

01:57.231 --> 01:59.064
- Hi, Caleb.
- Hi, Amy!

01:59.100 --> 02:02.635
You look absolutely,
positively glowing today.

02:02.670 --> 02:05.437
Uh... it's probably because
I have my husband back.

02:06.297 --> 02:08.607
Oh.

02:08.642 --> 02:10.908
It's Jack calling again.

02:10.943 --> 02:12.544
You're not gonna answer that?

02:12.579 --> 02:14.946
No. I'm just filling in,
doing some odd jobs for him

02:14.982 --> 02:18.484
while Tim's out of town, so...
there's really no rush.

02:22.956 --> 02:25.557
So life's good, hmm?

02:25.592 --> 02:27.592
Caleb,
answer your damn phone!

02:27.628 --> 02:29.628
You were supposed to
be checking this fence!

02:29.663 --> 02:31.963
Now get out here and fix it!

02:40.373 --> 02:42.673
Get up now!

02:42.708 --> 02:46.110
Oh great!

02:56.256 --> 02:58.355
Get outta here!

02:58.390 --> 02:59.996
Jerk!

03:00.788 --> 03:03.326
I'm pretty sure he can't hear you.

03:03.756 --> 03:06.163
Yeah, I guess you're right.

03:06.198 --> 03:09.236
- You need a hand?
- Yeah, I wouldn't mind.

03:10.502 --> 03:11.869
Get up!

03:11.904 --> 03:13.336
Hey! Come on!

03:14.170 --> 03:16.473
We're home!

03:16.508 --> 03:20.277
No, Lou... Lou!
Everything is fine.

03:20.312 --> 03:23.046
Jack and I have it under control.

03:23.082 --> 03:25.048
I certainly will. Okay.

03:25.084 --> 03:27.584
Hey! Have fun.

03:27.619 --> 03:30.186
All right. I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

03:32.323 --> 03:35.658
- How's New York?
- Well, sounds very busy!

03:35.694 --> 03:37.493
Did you finish your homework?

03:37.528 --> 03:39.062
Uh...

03:39.097 --> 03:42.732
And, uh, when is that very
cute tutor of yours popping by?

03:42.767 --> 03:44.100
Who's cute?

03:44.135 --> 03:47.436
- Georgie's tutor.
- Oh.

03:47.472 --> 03:49.805
Adam's not cute, he's weird,

03:49.840 --> 03:51.141
and he'll be here later.

03:51.194 --> 03:53.642
Hey, have you made a decision
on your life skills project yet?

03:53.677 --> 03:55.010
Ooh, a project?

03:57.181 --> 03:58.747
and research it for school.

03:58.782 --> 04:00.048
That sounds fun.

04:00.084 --> 04:01.750
I guess, but you don't know my teacher.

04:01.785 --> 04:03.118
It has to be ten pages

04:03.153 --> 04:05.087
and include a detailed business plan.

04:05.122 --> 04:07.889
I told her since Lou's away,
she could just job shadow me

04:07.925 --> 04:09.992
and find out what it's like
working with troubled horses.

04:10.027 --> 04:13.194
Well... or you could come to Fairfield

04:13.230 --> 04:15.864
and see how I run my breeding operation.

04:15.899 --> 04:17.398
We could drive by there this afternoon.

04:17.434 --> 04:19.034
Katie, how would you like that?

04:19.069 --> 04:20.468
You wanna go to Fairfield
and see all my horses?

04:20.504 --> 04:21.627
Yeah!

04:21.666 --> 04:24.805
Actually, I've already found
someone to shadow for my project.

04:24.841 --> 04:27.175
Oh.

04:27.210 --> 04:29.444
I just...
I didn't wanna hurt anyone's feelings,

04:33.617 --> 04:35.450
So who did you choose?

04:35.485 --> 04:37.852
Hello!

04:40.007 --> 04:43.124
Hi, Georgie! Are you ready to get started?

04:43.159 --> 04:44.892
Val!

04:45.192 --> 04:46.656
Hi.

04:47.496 --> 04:49.017
Hi, Lisa.

04:52.001 --> 04:55.403
So how's Amy doing?
Everyth- Is everything, uh, good?

04:57.406 --> 05:00.271
Yeah, I know, but we didn't really
have a chance to chat about it.

05:02.311 --> 05:04.811
Come on, Ty, you don't have
to play dumb with me. I know.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.346
You know what?

05:06.382 --> 05:08.081
Look,
I get why you guys haven't said anything.

05:10.961 --> 05:12.919
You know, selfishly,
I just wanted to be the first.

05:12.954 --> 05:15.555
Congratulations, brother.

05:15.590 --> 05:17.323
Caleb, what are you talking about?

05:17.358 --> 05:19.059
What do you mean, what am I talking about?

05:19.094 --> 05:21.460
I'm talking about Amy being pregnant.

06:12.779 --> 06:14.812
Hey! Hey!

06:17.349 --> 06:19.513
- Good boy.
- Hey, let's go!

06:30.696 --> 06:33.258
Oh, rotten gatepost.

06:34.433 --> 06:38.869
My guy who's supposed to be
checking up on all this, but...

06:38.904 --> 06:45.277
Well, what's it they say about
good help being hard to find?

06:46.808 --> 06:50.046
Mine's not that good.
I still can't find him.

06:52.584 --> 06:54.684
That'll do for now.

06:54.719 --> 06:56.586
I'll have to come back with some tools.

06:56.621 --> 06:58.188
I can stick around if you want.

06:58.223 --> 06:59.589
I'm kind of in between jobs right now,

06:59.624 --> 07:01.024
so I've got plenty of time.

07:01.059 --> 07:03.860
You've already done more than enough.
I appreciate it.

07:06.331 --> 07:08.197
Nice to meet ya, Jack.

07:08.232 --> 07:09.599
You know, my folks, they got a place

07:11.636 --> 07:15.223
- You ever heard of it?
- Yeah. That sounds familiar.

07:15.607 --> 07:17.039
They're downsizing right now.

07:17.074 --> 07:19.275
They just sold the ranch and
bought a condo in Calgary.

07:19.311 --> 07:20.810
I've been in town for a few weeks

07:20.845 --> 07:22.344
to help them sell off some things.

07:25.683 --> 07:28.583
Whoa, boy!

07:28.619 --> 07:30.519
Maverick!

07:30.959 --> 07:32.554
What a character.

07:34.258 --> 07:36.292
Yeah, when he's working,
he's fine, he's occupied,

07:36.327 --> 07:39.227
but when it's just the two of us,
the aggression starts.

07:39.262 --> 07:42.531
You know,
I'd like to get him to a good home, but...

07:42.566 --> 07:44.232
I don't know, with such a bad attitude,

07:44.267 --> 07:47.369
I just know he's gonna end up
on the back of some meat truck.

07:47.404 --> 07:49.504
I know someone who might be able to help,

07:56.713 --> 07:58.546
Well, here you are.

07:58.581 --> 08:00.537
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:01.318 --> 08:03.151
Oh, get a room, you two.

08:03.186 --> 08:05.553
Caleb! I thought you were
out working with Grandpa.

08:05.588 --> 08:07.455
And I will be. I just wanna, you know,

08:07.490 --> 08:08.990
get in some time with my buddy here...

08:09.025 --> 08:11.291
while we still can.

08:11.327 --> 08:13.894
Amy, Ty...

08:13.929 --> 08:17.297
This is Mitch Cutty and his horse,
Maverick.

08:19.335 --> 08:22.102
Yeah, if Mitch hadn't been
on a ride this morning,

08:22.137 --> 08:26.807
we might be out a few horses...
client horses at that.

08:26.843 --> 08:28.909
He saved our bacon, I'll tell ya.

08:28.947 --> 08:29.607
Hey, boy...

08:29.699 --> 08:31.705
Uh, you might-you might
wanna keep your distance.

08:31.780 --> 08:33.480
He's a little unpredictable.

08:33.933 --> 08:36.582
Now, Amy,
I don't know what your schedule is like,

08:36.618 --> 08:40.354
but from what Mitch tells me,
Maverick needs your help.

08:44.559 --> 08:46.342
How long you got?

08:48.663 --> 08:51.498
Hey, uh, Jack! Slow down a minute.

08:51.895 --> 08:53.933
You mad about something?
Well, I don't know.

08:53.968 --> 08:56.269
How about the three messages
I left you this morning?

08:58.407 --> 09:01.007
- I... was busy helping Ty.
- With what?!

09:01.042 --> 09:02.975
Last week,
I asked you to check the fence line.

09:03.011 --> 09:05.611
- Were you busy then, too?
- Well, actually...

09:05.646 --> 09:09.515
Oh, forget it.
I'm done depending on your availability.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.418
I need a full-time ranch hand.
Someone reliable.

09:12.453 --> 09:14.520
Jack, I'm flattered by the offer, but I...

09:14.555 --> 09:18.390
I wasn't talking about you. You're fired.

09:19.794 --> 09:21.593
I need to hire someone else.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.471
- Really?
- Really.

09:36.992 --> 09:38.776
Wow!

09:38.812 --> 09:42.823
And soon... it's gonna look like this.

09:43.317 --> 09:45.550
Most businesses are pulling
back with the recession,

09:45.585 --> 09:49.087
but I've decided to expand because...

09:49.122 --> 09:52.122
it's the only way to succeed.

09:52.158 --> 09:55.560
My philosophy has always been
go big or go home.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.667
How long have you had Maverick?

10:03.135 --> 10:05.703
Years.
You know, we used to be inseparable,

10:05.738 --> 10:08.439
but lately he's just turned a bit mean.

10:08.474 --> 10:10.674
I've handled my fair share of
belligerent bullies in the past,

10:10.709 --> 10:13.577
but none of them have
been a thousand pounds.

10:13.612 --> 10:15.512
Have there been any changes in his life?

10:15.547 --> 10:17.581
You know, a new environment?

10:17.616 --> 10:19.905
Maybe a different food, a new herdmate?

10:20.565 --> 10:21.852
No.

10:21.887 --> 10:23.854
And how much has he been ridden lately?

10:23.889 --> 10:26.422
Look, to be honest, I... I don't know.

10:26.458 --> 10:28.825
I've been away a lot. This is actually
the first time we've been together in...

10:32.931 --> 10:35.031
So what do you think?

10:35.066 --> 10:38.368
Can you help Maverick
or is he a lost cause?

10:38.754 --> 10:41.570
Well, he seems to trust me,
so that's a good start.

10:44.642 --> 10:47.043
You know, just to rule out anything.

10:49.481 --> 10:52.248
No, it's no trouble. It's what we do.

10:53.135 --> 10:55.118
Right, Ty?

10:55.153 --> 10:58.353
Yeah. Yeah, we don't mind helping at all.

10:58.389 --> 11:00.556
- Uh, thanks.
- Yeah.

11:01.803 --> 11:03.545
I really appreciate
what you guys are doing here.

11:03.664 --> 11:04.864
Mm-hmm.

11:08.866 --> 11:10.933
So... what do you want to start with?

11:13.470 --> 11:15.303
Yeah. I'm gonna do some groundwork,

11:15.339 --> 11:17.639
but so far I'm really not
seeing the dangerous horse

11:17.674 --> 11:19.674
that Mitch was talking about.

11:19.709 --> 11:21.876
Okay, well... just be careful.

11:21.912 --> 11:23.478
- Yeah.
- I mean it, Amy.

11:26.450 --> 11:29.567
- It'll be fine.
- I'll just spot you then, okay?

11:30.153 --> 11:32.047
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.089
Uh... anything else?

11:35.124 --> 11:38.159
No. Unless there's something
else you wanna talk about.

11:38.194 --> 11:40.161
- No.
- Okay.

11:43.199 --> 11:45.199
I gotta ask Caleb something.
Can you wait for me?

11:53.976 --> 11:55.642
Are you heading out?

11:55.678 --> 11:57.411
Guess so.

11:57.447 --> 11:59.746
Jack just fired me.
I mean, how can he fire me?

11:59.782 --> 12:03.050
I don't even work here.
I was just filling in.

12:06.388 --> 12:08.354
Still radio silence from Amy?

12:08.390 --> 12:11.642
Yeah.
Is that weird that she hasn't told me yet?

12:12.227 --> 12:13.927
Are you sure that she's pregnant?

12:16.198 --> 12:17.764
There was no mistaking. It was positive.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.532
Okay, this is crazy.
I'm just gonna ask her.

12:19.568 --> 12:21.968
Bad idea, man. Terrible.

12:22.003 --> 12:23.470
I mean, if she hasn't told you yet,

12:23.505 --> 12:26.038
she must be wanting to make it a surprise.

12:32.542 --> 12:33.913
Very funny.

12:33.948 --> 12:36.582
Or... maybe she hasn't told you
'cause she's not sure

12:40.655 --> 12:42.021
Well,
I always thought we were on the same page

12:43.758 --> 12:46.176
Maybe she changed her mind.

13:08.548 --> 13:10.615
Amy, I thought I asked you to wait.

13:10.651 --> 13:13.051
Ty, he's fine.

13:13.086 --> 13:15.620
Look, we're making real progress.

13:15.656 --> 13:19.490
Good boy... Good boy...

13:21.561 --> 13:23.895
That's it. Good boy.

13:29.068 --> 13:30.535
'Kay, that's it.

13:30.570 --> 13:32.102
Well, you've been at this awhile.

13:38.545 --> 13:40.778
No, I'm fine.

13:40.813 --> 13:43.013
Well, you should take care of yourself,
Amy, you know?

13:43.049 --> 13:45.549
Put your feet up and... just relax.

13:45.584 --> 13:47.284
I'm gonna take Maverick into the barn,

14:01.633 --> 14:03.633
- I'm back.
- Oh good!

14:03.669 --> 14:05.602
Dinner's almost ready.
I hope you're hungry.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.385
Starving.

14:10.723 --> 14:14.021
Hello! I thought I'd pop in and say hello.

14:14.060 --> 14:16.212
- Hello.
- Is Jack here?

14:16.247 --> 14:18.214
- Ye... Uh...
- Yeah, I'm right here, Val!

14:18.249 --> 14:19.849
Long time, no see.

14:19.884 --> 14:22.618
Ah, there he is! Hi, Jack.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.386
- Good to see you.
- You too.

14:24.422 --> 14:25.955
Boy, something smells good.

14:25.990 --> 14:29.632
That would be Lisa's
world famous Venison Stew.

14:30.186 --> 14:32.027
- Venison Stew?
- Oh yeah.

14:32.062 --> 14:34.496
I haven't had Venison Stew in forever.

14:34.532 --> 14:36.824
Well, you should stay for dinner.

14:37.180 --> 14:40.122
Thank you. I'd love to.

14:40.861 --> 14:43.236
Great!
Yes, love to have you.

14:44.108 --> 14:46.007
Okay, does everyone have enough?

14:47.544 --> 14:50.645
- Mm. This is amazing, Lisa.
- Oh, thank you!

14:50.680 --> 14:52.981
This has a really interesting flavour.

14:55.652 --> 14:58.386
Ooh! Whatever happened to
a little barbecue sauce

14:58.421 --> 14:59.855
and a grill, eh Jack?

15:04.193 --> 15:05.727
What, you're hiring?

15:05.762 --> 15:07.828
It's gonna be hard to find
someone this time of year, no?

15:09.832 --> 15:11.477
His name's Mitch Cutty.

15:11.543 --> 15:14.435
From everything I saw today,
I figure he'll make a real good hand.

15:14.471 --> 15:16.170
Said he's between jobs.

15:16.205 --> 15:17.736
I don't know about that, Grandpa.

15:17.789 --> 15:20.174
I mean, anyone who's willing to
desert their horse to go travel

15:21.911 --> 15:24.344
Let's not rush to a judgment now.

15:26.794 --> 15:29.723
Oh, that's Adam. May I be excused?

15:30.352 --> 15:32.599
Hey, take your plate.

15:37.259 --> 15:39.893
Well, I think that Maverick
has abandonment issues.

15:39.928 --> 15:41.628
A horse with abandonment issues?

15:44.933 --> 15:47.275
I think that Maverick blames
Mitch for leaving him.

15:47.592 --> 15:51.378
Adam. Why don't you pull up a chair?
We got plenty.

15:53.608 --> 15:56.285
In fact, you might wanna consider
cutting back yourself, Mr. Bartlett.

15:56.417 --> 15:58.044
Especially at your age.

15:58.950 --> 16:01.480
And who is this?
I don't think we've met.

16:03.384 --> 16:06.419
Oh, Katie, that's not very nice.

16:06.454 --> 16:08.221
I think you owe him an apology.

16:08.256 --> 16:10.682
Georgie said it first.

16:13.594 --> 16:15.428
We should go.

16:22.912 --> 16:25.671
What's congruent again?

16:26.830 --> 16:28.907
It's when two
triangles are identical,

16:40.387 --> 16:43.020
I don't care.
I already know you think I'm weird.

16:46.192 --> 16:48.360
I mean...

16:48.395 --> 16:50.495
When you're not being
such a know-it-all jerk,

16:50.530 --> 16:53.365
you can actually be... pretty cool.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.717
Er, cool's a stupid word.

16:55.954 --> 16:58.403
It doesn't really describe a person anyway.

16:58.438 --> 17:02.406
Well, when you're not making me
an accomplice to grand theft ATV,

17:02.441 --> 17:05.108
You can be pretty cool yourself.

17:05.144 --> 17:07.573
So does that make us congruent?

17:13.752 --> 17:15.800
Oh, I thought you were...

17:16.555 --> 17:18.489
- I...
- I should go.

17:37.495 --> 17:40.142
Well, good morning.

17:40.195 --> 17:41.673
What, don't you want something to eat?

17:41.739 --> 17:43.599
No, Val's here. I gotta go.

17:43.665 --> 17:45.433
Well, hey, what about breakfast?

17:45.499 --> 17:46.633
Why don't you take one of these?

17:53.973 --> 17:55.701
I think something happened last night.

17:57.548 --> 18:00.449
Well, I think Adam is more than
a tutor to Georgie these days.

18:00.484 --> 18:03.285
Oh, hey, hey.

18:07.692 --> 18:09.625
are lots of things to get done.

18:09.660 --> 18:12.727
Well, you can't keep doing
everything by yourself.

18:12.763 --> 18:15.130
You're gonna burn out, and that worries me.

18:15.166 --> 18:17.199
Well, that's nice that you're worried.

18:17.234 --> 18:19.701
No! I want you
to do something about it.

18:19.736 --> 18:22.003
- I'll call Mitch today.
- All right, good.

18:22.039 --> 18:24.139
And here's the first spreadsheet.

18:24.175 --> 18:26.041
Now, look at the far left column,

18:26.076 --> 18:28.109
and you'll see the revenues
Briar Ridge generates

18:28.145 --> 18:29.678
from boarding horses.

18:33.550 --> 18:37.285
and that's feed, utilities,
barn managers, farriers, vet costs

18:37.320 --> 18:41.004
you'll see that I can't get
by on boarding alone. Hmm?

18:41.954 --> 18:43.824
I'm sorry, am I going too fast?

18:43.859 --> 18:46.851
Oh, um... no, it's just...

18:47.115 --> 18:49.330
I don't mean to be rude, but...

18:49.365 --> 18:51.532
I can find a lot of this stuff on-line.

18:51.969 --> 18:55.903
I was hoping you could tell me the
truth about running a business.

18:55.938 --> 18:59.840
You know, the down and dirty everyday,
the juicy bits.

19:01.022 --> 19:03.811
The juicy bits?

19:04.346 --> 19:06.695
O-kay. Um...

19:07.583 --> 19:10.695
Well, there certainly have been
some challenges along the way.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.352
Like what?

19:12.387 --> 19:15.555
Like... well, like my husband passed away

19:15.591 --> 19:18.291
and left me on my own to run Briar Ridge.

19:18.327 --> 19:20.393
And I always felt like I
had to work twice as hard

19:20.429 --> 19:22.229
to get the same respect.

19:22.264 --> 19:24.598
Keep going. This is great!

19:24.633 --> 19:26.766
Well, I can tell you that if my experiences

19:26.801 --> 19:29.402
over the past few years
have taught me anything,

19:29.974 --> 19:31.438
is that it's true what they say...

19:31.473 --> 19:34.173
and write this down...

19:34.209 --> 19:38.510
life is short and you
can't have any regrets.

19:43.785 --> 19:45.851
Can I have an orange juice?

19:46.587 --> 19:49.488
Um... I'll-I'll-I'll be right back.

19:52.460 --> 19:53.911
Hey.

19:54.362 --> 19:56.101
I'm actually on my way to the library

19:56.180 --> 19:58.631
so I can't talk right now.

19:58.666 --> 20:00.899
Well, you'll still be around
for tutoring later, right?

20:00.934 --> 20:02.284
Here you go.

20:03.504 --> 20:05.470
I guess.

20:15.916 --> 20:18.316
Hey, Ty.
I didn't see your name on the schedule.

20:19.820 --> 20:22.052
I'm just here to pick up the
blood work results for Maverick.

20:22.088 --> 20:23.921
Have they come back from the lab yet?

20:23.956 --> 20:25.823
Yeah. It's on the desk.

20:32.412 --> 20:34.666
- Hey, Cass?
- Yeah?

20:34.701 --> 20:36.934
If you had something important going on,

20:49.015 --> 20:51.729
Is there something you wanna talk about?

20:56.522 --> 20:59.088
Thanks for this. See ya!

21:02.712 --> 21:04.861
Hey, Jack!

21:04.896 --> 21:08.532
Hello, Mitch! You come by to see Maverick?

21:11.002 --> 21:12.969
for introducing me to Amy and Ty.

21:13.004 --> 21:16.039
I think those two might actually
be able to tame that big baby.

21:16.074 --> 21:18.574
Well, I'm glad things are working out.

21:18.609 --> 21:20.476
You know, it's good you're here.

21:20.511 --> 21:22.712
I wanted to run something by you.

21:22.747 --> 21:26.850
Yeah? Shoot.

21:26.885 --> 21:30.319
Well, I'm not sure if you're
thinking of staying in town or not,

21:30.355 --> 21:34.156
but I'm hoping you might consider
coming to Heartland to work for me.

21:37.061 --> 21:40.579
- Er... you get the picture.
- Yeah, yeah. Um...

21:48.472 --> 21:50.538
oil field work was drying up.

21:52.042 --> 21:55.377
but I wanna give it a go,
see if it pans out.

22:04.401 --> 22:06.755
Maverick's been doing really
great with his groundwork,

22:06.790 --> 22:08.823
However...

22:08.859 --> 22:11.025
Here's the part where you tell
me that it's all my fault.

22:11.060 --> 22:13.794
I do believe that there's a
problem with your relationship.

22:13.966 --> 22:17.119
I think that Maverick feels abandoned.

22:17.277 --> 22:20.101
No offense, Amy, but you do know
Maverick's an animal, right?

22:20.136 --> 22:23.604
Yes. And animals are very intuitive,
especially horses.

22:24.071 --> 22:26.340
What other "feelings"
has he been sharing with you?

22:26.376 --> 22:28.490
I'm serious, Mitch, you know?

22:28.530 --> 22:32.113
I believe that horses are very
sensitive to their surroundings.

22:32.148 --> 22:35.218
And you mentioned a time when you
and Maverick were inseparable.

22:35.377 --> 22:36.784
Yeah.

22:36.819 --> 22:39.953
I can't help but wonder,
when you left, he was lonely.

22:39.988 --> 22:41.655
You know, he was used to
having you around all the time,

22:41.690 --> 22:45.058
and then you were gone and he had
to become the leader of the herd.

22:45.093 --> 22:46.493
So when you returned,

22:46.529 --> 22:48.061
he...
he didn't wanna give up that dominance.

22:48.096 --> 22:49.797
Look, I didn't desert my horse

22:49.832 --> 22:51.112
if that's what you're sayin'.

22:51.164 --> 22:54.634
When I went overseas,
my parents were looking after him. But...

22:54.669 --> 22:56.072
Then what?

22:57.205 --> 22:59.306
My mom had a stroke

22:59.341 --> 23:01.841
and my dad jumped into caretaker mode.

23:01.876 --> 23:04.377
The horses weren't a priority anymore.

23:04.413 --> 23:07.079
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

23:09.283 --> 23:11.617
So he was lonely, huh?

23:12.431 --> 23:14.320
Well, what can we do to fix that?

23:14.355 --> 23:16.823
Well, you need to repair the damage,

23:16.858 --> 23:18.624
restore your connection with him.

23:18.660 --> 23:20.993
This is starting to sound an
awful lot like couples therapy.

23:21.028 --> 23:23.495
You know, it's not too far off.

23:23.530 --> 23:26.966
Well, if it'll help him work through his
"feelings"

23:31.074 --> 23:35.574
I was hoping you'd say that.

23:38.012 --> 23:40.946
So, same time tomorrow?

23:46.158 --> 23:48.485
Uh, no. I-I-I'm fine.

23:49.990 --> 23:52.056
Georgie,
I couldn't help noticing the moment you had

23:52.092 --> 23:54.092
with your tutor at Maggie's.

23:59.366 --> 24:01.632
We're completely different in every way.

24:05.832 --> 24:08.006
it's complicated.

24:08.041 --> 24:10.741
- I totally understand.
- You do?

24:10.776 --> 24:15.379
There was this guy once...
let's call him Mr. X

24:15.414 --> 24:18.381
and this was after my husband passed away,
of course.

24:18.416 --> 24:23.853
Anyway, we were so different.
This Mr. X just drove me crazy,

24:23.889 --> 24:27.256
until I got to know him a little better.

24:33.498 --> 24:37.366
like his stubbornness
and his pigheadedness,

24:37.402 --> 24:40.336
were actually determination and loyalty,

24:40.371 --> 24:43.150
qualities I really admire in a man.

24:48.879 --> 24:52.848
Nothing. I waited too long.
Missed my chance.

24:54.752 --> 24:59.955
And Mr. X moved on with someone else.

25:08.131 --> 25:10.731
Good boy, Maverick.

25:10.767 --> 25:14.069
'Kay, see how I'm using my
energy to move his feet?

25:14.104 --> 25:15.670
You know, I'm establishing dominance,

25:15.705 --> 25:18.106
becoming the alpha.

25:18.141 --> 25:20.590
She ever try this on you?

25:21.262 --> 25:22.409
All the time.

25:22.445 --> 25:24.712
See? So I use my body language

25:24.747 --> 25:27.314
to tell him I'm in control.

25:33.990 --> 25:36.256
That's a good boy!

25:36.292 --> 25:37.792
You're a good boy.

25:37.827 --> 25:40.094
Wow. What did you do to my horse?

25:40.129 --> 25:41.462
Where's the real Maverick?

25:41.497 --> 25:43.297
I think he's ready to be ridden.

25:43.332 --> 25:45.110
All right.

25:47.103 --> 25:49.470
See? It's all about trust.

25:50.906 --> 25:52.606
- Whoa!
- Amy!

25:52.641 --> 25:54.774
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah. No, I'm fine.

25:54.810 --> 25:56.576
- I'm fine!
- We're done here.

25:56.612 --> 25:57.978
No. Look, it was as much my fault

25:58.013 --> 25:59.713
as it was Maverick's, okay?
He wasn't ready.

25:59.748 --> 26:02.348
- No, Amy. This isn't happening, okay?
- Ty!

26:07.816 --> 26:10.811
I can't believe you embarrassing me
like that out there.

26:10.899 --> 26:12.265
Why are you being like this?

26:12.300 --> 26:13.900
It's not the first time
I've fallen off a horse.

26:13.935 --> 26:15.935
Okay, I know, Amy.

26:15.971 --> 26:17.726
Ty, what's wrong with you?

26:17.766 --> 26:19.472
Ever since you got back
from that conference,

26:19.507 --> 26:21.041
you've been acting strange.

26:21.076 --> 26:23.976
Did something...
happen while you were gone?

26:24.011 --> 26:27.513
I've been wondering the same thing.

26:28.223 --> 26:29.647
Amy, I know.

26:29.713 --> 26:31.481
You know what?

26:31.534 --> 26:34.304
That you're pregnant. Caleb saw the test.

26:34.370 --> 26:37.791
- What test?
- The pregnancy test in the bathroom.

26:37.826 --> 26:39.792
How could you keep that from me?!

26:41.393 --> 26:44.691
Because... I'm not pregnant.

26:45.575 --> 26:46.999
Wait. You're not pregnant?

26:51.038 --> 26:53.983
you will be the first to know if I am.

26:54.194 --> 26:56.441
Huh.

27:00.197 --> 27:01.746
I let Caleb get into my head.

27:15.362 --> 27:17.762
There's still one thing I don't get though.

27:17.798 --> 27:21.934
The pregnancy test, it was positive.

27:25.364 --> 27:27.580
Ty, I... I can't.

27:29.937 --> 27:33.169
Lou? Lou is pregnant?! Wow.

27:33.379 --> 27:35.412
No... No. No.

27:35.448 --> 27:38.697
Not unless it was some
immaculate conception.

27:43.393 --> 27:44.856
Cass?

27:49.976 --> 27:51.695
Oh...

27:58.571 --> 28:01.004
- Hi!
- Hey! What're you doing?

28:01.039 --> 28:03.340
Um,
I'm just reorganizing things a little bit

28:03.375 --> 28:06.743
so they're more efficient
for Lou when she gets home.

28:06.778 --> 28:09.079
Yeah, 'cause Lou loves change.

28:13.146 --> 28:17.053
So how come Jack never expanded Heartland?

28:18.343 --> 28:21.457
Um... I don't know.

28:28.132 --> 28:30.566
but then she developed
it into something huge.

28:30.602 --> 28:33.284
- Now she makes millions.
- Mmhmm.

28:34.590 --> 28:37.439
Well, I guess, at some point,
you're gonna have to ask yourself

28:43.314 --> 28:45.948
I guarantee you Amy could tell you

28:47.818 --> 28:50.678
because she has worked with them,
one on one.

28:51.166 --> 28:53.858
I don't think Val Stanton
could say the same.

29:04.100 --> 29:05.467
I'll catch you next morning, okay?

29:05.502 --> 29:08.336
Yeah, have a great day.

29:17.930 --> 29:20.949
So any word yet from
Amy about the big news?

29:21.610 --> 29:24.218
Uh, big news is she isn't pregnant.

29:24.254 --> 29:27.621
- Oh. She's not?
- No, she's not.

29:28.484 --> 29:30.491
Hmm. Well, uh... sorry about that.

29:30.526 --> 29:32.426
I didn't mean to get you
all worked up over nothing.

29:32.462 --> 29:34.962
Oh, yeah. Thanks for that, by the way.

29:35.561 --> 29:38.015
- So who is?
- Who's what?

29:38.067 --> 29:40.468
Well, someone's pregnant. Who is it?

29:42.904 --> 29:45.172
Hey, what's up? You're acting all weird.

29:47.943 --> 29:50.143
I can't, man. I promised I wouldn't, so...

29:50.179 --> 29:51.678
It's not my place to say.

29:51.713 --> 29:53.713
Come on, man, it's me.

30:00.388 --> 30:02.989
You might wanna talk to Cass
about that pregnancy test.

30:03.196 --> 30:04.620
Cass?

30:05.727 --> 30:08.795
Just make sure to...

30:08.830 --> 30:10.797
"Keep it under your hat"!

30:14.916 --> 30:16.668
Okay, that's everything for today.

30:16.704 --> 30:20.074
But you'll have to come back
for his rabies booster, okay?

30:20.285 --> 30:22.608
Cass! Baby! Cass!

30:26.914 --> 30:28.714
What are you doing?!
Can't you see I'm working?

30:28.749 --> 30:31.383
But I-I just don't understand
why you wouldn't tell me.

30:31.418 --> 30:33.752
I had to hear it through Ty.

30:33.787 --> 30:35.954
- Amy told you?
- Yeah.

30:35.990 --> 30:38.256
- Can't anyone keep a secret?
- It's not his fault.

30:38.291 --> 30:40.992
I found the test in the loft.

30:41.028 --> 30:42.599
I'm not pregnant.

30:47.467 --> 30:50.301
I finally got the test
results back from my doctor

30:56.609 --> 30:59.789
- Okay. - I'm... sorry.
- Oh my God.

31:19.031 --> 31:22.699
Look, Georgie. I'm sorry for the other day.

31:22.734 --> 31:26.102
I behaved in a completely
inappropriate manner.

31:29.575 --> 31:31.575
No. You don't need to apologize.

31:37.749 --> 31:41.651
But... there is something
I've been meaning to tell you.

31:43.421 --> 31:46.722
Uh... Lisa thought you might want a snack.

32:24.361 --> 32:27.195
Hey, Amy,
can I talk to you about something?

32:32.301 --> 32:35.500
Adam... kind of tried to kiss me.

32:37.057 --> 32:39.007
And...?

32:44.648 --> 32:46.080
You know what? This-this was a bad idea.

32:46.116 --> 32:48.616
No, Georgie. Hey! Hey.

32:53.022 --> 32:59.048
So... if you like Adam and he likes you...

32:59.616 --> 33:01.328
I don't see the problem.

33:01.364 --> 33:04.231
Well, I've never kissed anyone before.

33:04.267 --> 33:06.166
It's... mortifying.

33:06.201 --> 33:08.969
It really can't be much
worse than my first kiss.

33:09.004 --> 33:10.704
I was in the fourth grade

33:10.739 --> 33:14.507
and Danny Bowman tried to
kiss me in the tire tunnel,

33:14.543 --> 33:17.144
but somehow my hair got
stuck in his braces.

33:23.618 --> 33:25.151
That's embarrassing.

33:25.187 --> 33:28.775
Yeah! So things can't be that bad, right?

33:30.516 --> 33:32.225
It doesn't matter anyways.

33:32.260 --> 33:36.028
Adam tried to kiss me and I...
totally pulled away.

33:36.374 --> 33:39.531
Now Jack's hovering over us,
watching our every move.

33:44.305 --> 33:45.671
I missed my chance.

33:48.976 --> 33:51.746
then why don't you kiss him?

34:03.477 --> 34:04.909
Hey, I got your message.

34:04.988 --> 34:07.646
Although I gotta say I was pretty
surprised to hear from you after yesterday.

34:07.681 --> 34:09.813
I know. I'm sorry.

34:09.850 --> 34:12.183
My husband and I were going
through some personal stuff,

34:14.087 --> 34:17.388
I appreciate the apology, but you
just could've told me over the phone.

34:23.871 --> 34:26.496
after you found out your mom had a stroke?

34:28.268 --> 34:29.900
Yeah.

34:35.428 --> 34:37.684
at least not permanently.

34:38.578 --> 34:40.143
I was in the military.

34:40.179 --> 34:43.179
So... so you're a soldier?

34:43.215 --> 34:45.983
Why didn't you just say that?

34:49.755 --> 34:51.822
When I was deployed my parents
they didn't want me to worry,

34:51.857 --> 34:53.356
So they didn't tell me
about my mom's stroke

34:55.061 --> 34:58.261
If I'd known,
I-I would've come home right away.

34:58.297 --> 35:01.097
I guess I should know there's
always more to the story.

35:03.468 --> 35:05.468
You couldn't have known.

35:05.504 --> 35:07.937
Besides, my military days are over.

35:13.666 --> 35:16.278
I don't know what I'm gonna
do with the rest of my life.

35:30.976 --> 35:33.997
So... what do you think?

35:34.683 --> 35:38.467
Well... I have to say,

35:41.138 --> 35:44.106
I'm a little disappointed.

35:44.141 --> 35:45.907
I don't understand why you didn't...

35:45.943 --> 35:49.277
detail more of the strategies we discussed.

35:49.312 --> 35:51.613
What about boarding sixty or more horses?

35:51.648 --> 35:53.815
What about having
multiple trainers on staff

35:56.264 --> 36:00.421
You didn't even factor a marketing
budget into your business plan.

36:07.130 --> 36:10.559
Georgie, you have to think bigger.

36:12.368 --> 36:14.801
Mrs. Stanton,
thank you so much for your help

36:19.708 --> 36:24.210
But if I do decide to run a
horse business of my own someday,

36:24.246 --> 36:27.546
I...
want it to be a little more like Heartland.

36:29.017 --> 36:30.850
Heartland.

36:35.924 --> 36:37.690
Okay.
So I want you to apply pressure on him

36:37.725 --> 36:39.325
to move him away from you

36:39.360 --> 36:41.227
and he should just pivot
around on his back feet,

36:41.263 --> 36:43.462
just feeding off your pressure. Okay.

36:45.232 --> 36:48.467
- There you go.
- Good boy.

36:48.503 --> 36:51.003
- That was great.
- Good boy!

36:54.875 --> 36:57.343
Nice. There you go.

36:58.913 --> 37:00.779
Ah, good boy.

37:01.114 --> 37:04.216
Just use your body to push him back.

37:14.761 --> 37:16.994
He's already slowing down.
I want more energy.

37:24.538 --> 37:25.903
Come on.

37:44.657 --> 37:46.490
Good boy.

37:46.525 --> 37:48.625
Look at you two, thick as thieves.

37:51.786 --> 37:53.230
Thanks to Amy.

37:54.794 --> 37:57.033
Oh, good boy. Yes...

37:59.472 --> 38:03.026
You should have no problem
finding Maverick a new home now.

38:06.778 --> 38:07.436
Really?

38:07.542 --> 38:09.468
I'd love to board him
here while I'm up north.

38:09.547 --> 38:11.181
If you guys got the space, of course.

38:11.216 --> 38:13.116
So you're... still leaving?

38:13.151 --> 38:16.814
Yeah. But, uh, thank you for everything.

38:18.357 --> 38:21.123
- You too, Jack.
- Anytime.

39:21.612 --> 39:24.517
So... sounds like Mitch is sticking around.

39:24.583 --> 39:26.430
I have a new ranch hand.

39:26.470 --> 39:28.580
Oh good! That's terrific.

39:28.786 --> 39:32.555
- How'd it go with Val?
- Uh... okay, I guess.

39:32.590 --> 39:34.223
What does that mean?

39:34.258 --> 39:36.192
Well, Briar Ridge was absolutely amazing,

39:36.227 --> 39:40.160
but I told Val I wanted to run a
place more like Heartland someday.

39:44.935 --> 39:46.969
Val's not all bad.

39:47.004 --> 39:50.038
There is one thing I
still haven't figured out.

39:50.073 --> 39:52.908
She told this story about having regrets.

39:52.943 --> 39:56.077
She fell for this guy after
her husband passed away,

39:56.113 --> 39:58.579
but I still haven't figured out who he was.

39:58.615 --> 40:00.982
She called him Mr. X.

40:03.175 --> 40:05.141
- What?
- Nothing.

40:10.260 --> 40:13.093
Wait. Jack, you're Mr. X? You?

40:14.864 --> 40:17.891
Good thing I scooped him up
while I had the chance, eh?

40:26.208 --> 40:28.699
- Play.
- Mm-hmm.

40:53.625 --> 40:55.050
Hey.

41:17.286 --> 41:19.224
I don't wanna have regrets.

41:29.541 --> 41:30.807
Hey.

41:31.939 --> 41:33.871
Georgie's first kiss.

41:33.907 --> 41:35.574
Okay, come on. Quit spying.

41:38.034 --> 41:41.379
Aww! Do you remember our first kiss?

41:41.415 --> 41:43.984
- No, I don't.
- You do too!

41:44.142 --> 41:45.817
Yeah, of course.
It was right here, wasn't it?

41:45.852 --> 41:47.352
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

41:47.387 --> 41:50.187
And you said something like, uh...

41:50.223 --> 41:52.189
"Talking's overrated," I think you said.

41:52.225 --> 41:54.058
- Mm-hmm?
- Yeah.

42:03.366 --> 42:06.670
- Well, that was some kiss.
- No, no, I think it's your phone.

42:06.705 --> 42:09.240
Oh, right. Thank you.

42:12.205 --> 42:14.177
Looks like he worked things out with Cass.

42:16.748 --> 42:23.283
But we still haven't talked
about my non-pregnancy yet.

42:23.692 --> 42:27.557
Yeah, I was a little, uh,
crazy there, wasn't I?

42:32.596 --> 42:34.229
you can't bubble wrap me.

42:37.301 --> 42:40.105
I know, Amy, and that's why I love you.

42:40.938 --> 42:43.906
You know this whole situation
has made me think about us

42:43.941 --> 42:45.764
and our future and...

42:49.146 --> 42:51.446
I do really wanna have kids with you.

42:51.482 --> 42:53.588
Me too.

42:54.017 --> 42:57.889
- But not quite yet...
- No, not yet.

43:32.911 --> 43:33.438
You all right?

43:34.520 --> 43:35.787
Why are you so bugged by Olivia?

43:35.826 --> 43:37.746
Do you think I like her, or something?

43:37.798 --> 43:40.839
It's bad enough that she's on the team,
why do you have to train her?

43:40.892 --> 43:42.629
- Do you like, like him?
- I'll see you at practice.
