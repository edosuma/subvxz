01:30.557 --> 01:33.225
Sam, you missed another payment.

01:33.226 --> 01:36.061
Don't back be into a corner.
Make this right.

01:36.062 --> 01:39.199
I really don't want
to go on like this.

01:45.738 --> 01:49.708
Hey, it's me.
I'm in Louisiana right now

01:49.709 --> 01:50.477
on business.

01:50.478 --> 01:53.378
You're not... you're not making
this easy on me.

01:53.379 --> 01:54.780
I am doing the best that I can.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.348
I'm gonna be back
in LA later today

01:56.349 --> 01:59.152
hopefully we can get a chance
to talk.

02:02.922 --> 02:05.158
Give the kids a kiss for me.

02:05.859 --> 02:06.726
Happy New Year.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.795
You okay, sir?

03:18.097 --> 03:20.200
Sir, can you hear me?

03:21.868 --> 03:23.235
Sir, can you hear me okay?

03:27.340 --> 03:29.776
You got any identification
on you?

03:31.077 --> 03:31.644
Uh...

03:31.645 --> 03:32.911
Sir, I need to see
some identification.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.813
I'm gonna check your pockets,
okay?

03:34.814 --> 03:37.416
You all right?
Hang in there with me.

03:49.495 --> 03:54.234
Sam Collins, you sure are a long
ways from home, Sam Collins.

04:31.804 --> 04:32.672
Champagne, ladies.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.941
Thank you.
You're welcome.

05:09.442 --> 05:10.943
Ladies.

05:14.847 --> 05:17.650
Evening, doctor.
Good party.

05:22.488 --> 05:26.426
Feeling groovy yet?
Oh, yeah!

05:27.360 --> 05:29.828
Sam Collins, so glad
you could make it.

05:29.829 --> 05:32.097
Hey, Dr. Alexander, thank you
for having me.

05:32.098 --> 05:33.965
Certainly.
This is, um...

05:33.966 --> 05:34.966
This is a beautiful house.

05:34.967 --> 05:38.070
Ah, it's my summer home I get
away to in the winter sometimes.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.738
Little place to clear the head.

05:39.739 --> 05:41.507
Well, it's beautiful.

05:42.709 --> 05:43.543
For your collection.

05:43.544 --> 05:48.513
Ah, mercí, very kind of you,
though certainly unnecessary.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.350
There will be plenty of that
going around tonight.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.454
Let me introduce you
to somebody very special.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.356
Bonnie?

05:56.689 --> 05:59.926
Hi.
Hello... looking lovely.

05:59.992 --> 06:03.328
Bonnie Jules, please meet
Sam Collins.

06:03.329 --> 06:05.831
Bonnie is a very dear friend
of mine

06:05.832 --> 06:08.067
and a fantastic party planner.

06:08.501 --> 06:09.268
Hi, Sam.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.635
Pleasure to meet you.

06:10.636 --> 06:15.775
And please let me know
if I can get you anything.

06:17.276 --> 06:21.546
And the greatest skill in life
is perfect timing.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.683
Champagne anyone?
This is something Thomas

06:24.684 --> 06:27.152
and I have perfected
over the years.

06:27.153 --> 06:29.856
Now, please...
Okay.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.827
That's all for now, Thomas.

06:36.262 --> 06:37.696
Cheers.
Cheers.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.966
Cheers.

06:47.507 --> 06:51.477
You're so lucky... ugh!
Morning wood.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.406
How are you doing, man?
Good, man, how you doing?

07:21.407 --> 07:23.074
I'm good, how you been?

07:23.075 --> 07:25.011
Courtesy of the doctor.

07:25.077 --> 07:26.812
Thank you, I appreciate it.

07:26.813 --> 07:28.280
Y'all didn't have
to do all this.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.949
Yeah, you know, we appreciate
your services.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.218
Just doing my job.
How's your Dad?

07:33.219 --> 07:36.488
You know, I ain't seen that son
of a bitch in years.

07:36.489 --> 07:37.789
All right.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.324
Have some champagne, man,
it's New Year's.

07:39.325 --> 07:42.761
Oh, man, I'm working.
Now you... don't drink too much.

07:42.762 --> 07:43.362
See you.

07:43.363 --> 07:45.898
All right, man, tell your Dad
I said hey!

07:51.771 --> 07:54.773
Another winner, ain't nothing
shakin' but the bacon.

07:54.774 --> 07:57.210
Ain't nothing up but the rent.

07:57.877 --> 07:58.611
So you're Sam.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.479
The doctor speaks
very highly of you.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.981
Hans Dunkle, Prime Waters
Insurance.

08:02.982 --> 08:06.219
I handle all of the doctor's
insurance needs.

08:07.520 --> 08:08.454
Sam Collins, VaxCorp.

08:08.455 --> 08:12.491
Hm, you know, I always wondered
about this vaccine stuff, uh...

08:12.492 --> 08:15.393
Some people say you do
more harm than good.

08:15.394 --> 08:17.462
I suppose it depends
on who you talk to.

08:17.463 --> 08:19.664
You know, 2.5 million lives are
saved each year

08:19.665 --> 08:21.433
because of our vaccinations.

08:21.434 --> 08:22.634
But what about
all the children who die

08:22.635 --> 08:25.804
because of negative reactions
to the vaccines?

08:25.805 --> 08:29.742
Well, statistically actually,
those children are...

08:31.344 --> 08:32.910
I'm boring myself.

08:32.912 --> 08:35.313
Yeah, let's cut all this
jibber-jabber.

08:35.313 --> 08:37.649
It's New Year's Eve, we're
celebrating the New Year

08:37.650 --> 08:39.985
with all its hopes
and aspirations.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.087
Black jack!

08:42.087 --> 08:45.490
I'll drink to that.
I couldn't agree more!

08:45.491 --> 08:48.261
Uh, I gotta see a man
about a dog.

08:49.095 --> 08:52.865
Watch my chips.
This man is a drug dealer.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.920
I love your tuxedo.

09:14.754 --> 09:15.488
Thank you.

09:15.489 --> 09:20.358
They say tuxedos on men are like
lingerie on women.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.263
Well, it's a good thing
I didn't rent this one, then.

09:29.902 --> 09:33.272
You seem tense. Rough year?

09:34.106 --> 09:34.941
You could say that.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.409
You know this is what
she does for a living?

09:37.410 --> 09:38.311
And what's that?

09:38.312 --> 09:40.245
I'm a massage therapist.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.747
Oh?

09:43.482 --> 09:45.117
What do you do?

09:45.451 --> 09:49.221
Oh, I work at the Fun House
in my spare time.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.697
But we're, uh, we're separated,

09:58.698 --> 10:02.067
we have...
we have two beautiful children.

10:02.068 --> 10:06.072
Oh, wow, boys, girls?
Yeah. Hi, thank you.

10:06.372 --> 10:07.306
Tell me more.

10:07.307 --> 10:12.711
We have... I have one of each.
Actually, yeah, I have both.

a little jealous.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.692
You're crazy.

11:00.693 --> 11:03.962
Why can't you just enjoy
the evening.

11:03.963 --> 11:06.432
I was just waiting
for permission.

11:10.069 --> 11:12.138
Permission granted.

11:13.973 --> 11:17.109
Don't worry, you'll always
be my favorite.

11:18.277 --> 11:21.380
I'm not so sure about that
anymore.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.183
Don't worry about Tammy.

11:24.550 --> 11:28.421
She's young, she's got plenty
of other hearts to break.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.221
Whatever you say.

11:30.222 --> 11:34.060
You think the doctor's in love
with you? He's gonna marry you?

11:35.928 --> 11:40.266
I think it's time for me
to get a top-off.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.468
Would you like one?

11:44.036 --> 11:45.705
Yep.

12:38.090 --> 12:42.293
I think Vince is mad at me.
He gets like that sometimes.

12:42.294 --> 12:43.661
How'd you come up with that?

12:43.662 --> 12:45.630
He'd be having a drink
out here with us otherwise.

12:45.631 --> 12:48.767
Not with that piece of ass
on his arm. I don't blame him.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.770
I mean, look at that.

12:50.836 --> 12:53.037
It's New Year's Eve,
for Christ's sake...

12:53.038 --> 12:54.539
and he's got us on this stupid,
fuckin' boat...

12:54.540 --> 12:57.609
watchin' for alligators.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

12:57.610 --> 13:01.514
First of all, this is
a very nice boat.

13:01.747 --> 13:03.882
Second, what's with you?

13:03.883 --> 13:06.184
You're always
fucking complaining?

13:06.185 --> 13:08.153
What's with me?
Yeah!

13:08.154 --> 13:10.221
If you'd be home, what would
you be doing?

13:10.222 --> 13:11.790
I'd be at Rao's, a nice,
hot meal,

13:11.791 --> 13:15.327
a beautiful broad on my arm,
with a nice bottle of champagne.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.395
You're a fuckin' moron!

13:20.099 --> 13:22.334
I gotta take this call.
Uh-huh.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.004
Okay, babe.

13:26.071 --> 13:28.106
We're being paid
to be down here...

13:28.107 --> 13:31.209
in the worst economy since
Jimmy Carter.

13:31.210 --> 13:32.044
And you're complaining?

13:32.045 --> 13:34.580
You should be counting
your blessings.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.819
You see them?

13:41.220 --> 13:43.021
They're losing brain cells.

13:43.022 --> 13:47.025
Me, tomorrow I go to the gym,
I get my workout in...

13:47.026 --> 13:48.993
I'm good to go.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.762
These mosquitoes are huge
out here.

13:50.763 --> 13:53.232
They work out just like you,
Zika!

13:54.166 --> 13:57.136
It's Zanca with a C.

13:59.772 --> 14:03.908
You watch, they're gonna come up
with a vaccine for that shit.

14:03.909 --> 14:05.343
It'll make millions.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.811
You're not as dumb as you look!

14:06.812 --> 14:09.914
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you go rub one out?

14:09.915 --> 14:13.619
Burn some calories.
God knows you need it.

14:14.753 --> 14:17.322
Why don't you transplant that
mustache on your head.

14:17.323 --> 14:19.391
God knows you need that.

14:24.663 --> 14:26.866
Mind if I have a drink?

14:35.941 --> 14:38.309
Good evening, Doc.
Hello, Vincent!

14:38.310 --> 14:40.545
I hope you'll be attending my
party. You on your way?

14:40.546 --> 14:41.946
I think it's gonna be
a quiet night

14:41.947 --> 14:44.349
here tonight.
We just... we just rolled in.

14:44.350 --> 14:45.251
Ah! That's too bad.

14:45.252 --> 14:48.019
I was hoping to have some drinks
with my favorite investor!

14:48.020 --> 14:50.555
Well, you know, I'm glad you
brought that up.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.958
How is that new contract
coming along?

14:53.959 --> 14:54.660
Fine, fine!

14:54.661 --> 14:57.428
We will be
out of the red by sunrise.

14:57.429 --> 15:01.266
Why, I sure hope your enthusiasm
lives up to its promise, Doc.

15:01.267 --> 15:04.102
You've put me in a very bad spot
with my investors.

15:04.103 --> 15:09.107
I don't like to hear that!
How can I make good?

15:09.108 --> 15:10.608
You know, my guys put
in the cash

15:10.609 --> 15:13.444
to turn the investment,
not to lose it!

15:13.445 --> 15:14.413
You know, I gotta tell you,

15:14.414 --> 15:16.581
so far, it's been
a very bad experience.

15:16.582 --> 15:20.184
Vince, I don't have
to remind you that the medical

15:20.185 --> 15:23.888
vaccine business is
a $24 billion market,

15:23.889 --> 15:24.590
as we speak.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.090
I mean, we're not dealing
with some

15:26.091 --> 15:29.027
construction company
or some convenience store here.

15:29.028 --> 15:31.162
All right, there have been some
hiccups along the way

15:31.163 --> 15:33.064
but I assure you...
Let me cut to the chase

15:33.065 --> 15:35.333
here, Doc.
I don't run a charity here.

15:35.334 --> 15:36.268
And I could give two shits

15:36.269 --> 15:38.670
what vaccines you're working on,
to be perfectly honest with you.

15:38.671 --> 15:39.671
That's not how I do business.

15:39.672 --> 15:43.575
I don't appreciate you talkin' to
me in this condescending tone.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.411
I apologize, of course.

15:46.412 --> 15:50.315
Just... I am sorting it out,
as we speak.

15:50.316 --> 15:54.452
It's in the works, Vincent.
You have my word.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.721
At this point, that's all
you got!

15:56.722 --> 15:57.456
I understand.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.459
I'll see you in the morning.
Happy New Year!

16:09.969 --> 16:12.037
Can I get you anything?

16:13.305 --> 16:15.240
Fetch me Sam Collins.

16:21.447 --> 16:25.017
Sam, have a seat.
Okay.

16:32.558 --> 16:35.027
I looked over the paperwork...

16:35.828 --> 16:39.999
and what makes you think

16:40.232 --> 16:42.834
I would sign this deal with you?

16:42.835 --> 16:45.136
Our vaccines have
the best proven track record

16:45.137 --> 16:46.705
in the field.

16:47.473 --> 16:49.607
I have the statistical research
to back that up.

16:49.608 --> 16:51.042
Sam...
I could just have him...

16:51.043 --> 16:53.579
Sam.
Yeah.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.417
I'm fucking with you.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.290
Why would I bring you to my home
on New Year's Eve

17:07.291 --> 17:11.030
if I didn't want to do
business with you? Huh?

17:11.296 --> 17:16.635
All right here, all signed.
Congratulations.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.906
I wasn't expecting...
this tonight.

17:21.906 --> 17:25.743
Louisiana is a marvelous state
for the unexpected.

17:26.744 --> 17:28.613
You can say that again.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.516
Don't let me down, okay?

17:30.716 --> 17:31.916
I won't.

17:31.917 --> 17:35.153
I bring you into my home,
so understand that anything

17:35.154 --> 17:39.491
that happens here is extremely
private, catch my drift?

17:39.591 --> 17:40.292
Sure.

17:40.293 --> 17:44.830
You need anything,
you come to me... okay?

17:45.664 --> 17:48.634
Now, let's have some fun!

17:50.036 --> 17:53.071
To business and pleasure.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.574
I agree... I agree.

17:55.707 --> 17:58.242
Mm, oh, sure...

Renee to Dispatch,
I have a 10-37.

20:51.316 --> 20:54.051
Copy that, 10-37.

20:54.052 --> 20:57.088
Suspicious vehicle on
Blood River Road Crossing

20:57.089 --> 20:58.824
Highway 22.

21:11.336 --> 21:14.605
Hey, Billy... hey, where did you
find this guy?

21:14.606 --> 21:15.606
Uh, out on Highway 22.

21:15.607 --> 21:19.577
He was throwing up all over
the place and passed out on me.

21:19.578 --> 21:20.745
Why, what's going on with him?

21:20.746 --> 21:21.846
Well, he's severely dehydrated.

21:21.847 --> 21:24.215
His temperature and blood
pressure are abnormally high.

21:24.216 --> 21:28.520
Um, our preliminary blood sample
shows some sort of poisoning.

21:28.854 --> 21:30.121
Like alcohol?

21:30.122 --> 21:31.722
No, it's much worse than that.

21:31.723 --> 21:33.691
What a way to start
the new years, huh?

21:33.692 --> 21:35.760
We're gonna run
some more tests, but...

21:35.761 --> 21:39.497
he is in no shape to be released
any time soon.

21:39.498 --> 21:42.967
I'll tell you what, I'll contact
his family or next of kin,

21:42.968 --> 21:44.735
let them know.
Okay, good idea.

21:44.736 --> 21:45.604
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

21:45.605 --> 21:47.338
Well, then thanks for bringing
him in, okay?

21:47.339 --> 21:48.974
Yeah, you got it.

22:10.062 --> 22:11.095
Captain.

22:11.096 --> 22:13.664
I'm missing my wife's
New Years Day cooking for this.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.733
A tradition
for the whole family.

22:15.734 --> 22:16.568
What does she make?

22:16.569 --> 22:18.969
Black-eyed peas and cabbage
for good luck

22:18.970 --> 22:20.671
and money all year long.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.973
Oh, that's right, you
Armenians don't celebrate

22:22.974 --> 22:24.208
New Year's with us, do you?

22:24.209 --> 22:26.645
I'm going to pretend
you didn't say that.

22:26.745 --> 22:27.579
Where's the body?

22:27.580 --> 22:29.814
Up here.
Who called it in?

22:29.815 --> 22:31.849
One of the guests that stayed
the night.

22:31.850 --> 22:35.786
I wanna talk to 'em.
Who owns this place?

22:35.787 --> 22:38.155
Doctor Richard Alexander.

22:38.156 --> 22:40.058
The doc does okay.

22:40.125 --> 22:41.059
Did.

22:45.130 --> 22:47.031
What kind of doctor was he?

22:47.032 --> 22:49.735
Medicine research, vaccines.

22:50.001 --> 22:51.570
Research?

22:51.970 --> 22:54.005
Nice fucking dinghy.

22:54.906 --> 22:56.974
Let's get a look at those
security cameras.

22:56.975 --> 23:00.478
List all the vehicles coming,
going, last 24 hours or so.

23:00.479 --> 23:03.447
Maybe we'll find one
without a tire iron.

23:03.448 --> 23:04.850
Right.

23:06.251 --> 23:08.520
No vaccine for that.

23:16.027 --> 23:17.929
Hey, so how you feeling?

23:19.064 --> 23:21.599
Fine, yeah, fine.

23:21.600 --> 23:25.537
Uh, a little bit confused
on what happened.

23:27.172 --> 23:29.306
Do you have any family
or loved ones in the area

23:29.307 --> 23:31.409
that can come and be with you?

23:31.410 --> 23:33.477
No, my wife and kids are
in California.

23:33.478 --> 23:36.480
I'm here on business.
What are you... um...

23:36.481 --> 23:41.118
Mr. Collins, have you suffered
from any kind of depression

23:41.119 --> 23:43.488
or had thoughts of suicide?

23:44.022 --> 23:47.759
No... why are you asking?

23:47.826 --> 23:52.597
Well, we found a rare poison
in your blood stream.

23:55.133 --> 23:57.334
Wh... poison?

23:57.335 --> 23:59.837
Your system's absorbed
a sufficient amount of a toxin

23:59.838 --> 24:05.309
called botulinum toxin type H,
proves to be fatal...

24:05.310 --> 24:07.578
along with a mixture
of other ingredients.

24:07.579 --> 24:09.580
I've never seen
anything like it.

24:09.581 --> 24:11.015
This new toxin can't be
neutralized

24:11.016 --> 24:13.751
by any of the current
anti-botulinum antisera,

24:13.752 --> 24:16.120
which means there's
no effective treatment

24:16.121 --> 24:19.024
for this form of botulism.

24:21.226 --> 24:22.693
I don't understand what
the fuck...

24:22.694 --> 24:24.729
Well, what are you saying?

24:24.896 --> 24:29.067
Your body's absorbed a toxin
that will kill you.

24:29.935 --> 24:31.469
Okay, there's no antidote
for this.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.636
There's been
a few recent studies

24:32.637 --> 24:35.406
of possible antitoxins in mice,
but...

24:35.407 --> 24:37.141
Are you fucking kidding me?

24:37.142 --> 24:39.744
I'm afraid I'm not.
Mice?

24:41.279 --> 24:43.747
You think I killed myself?
No, I didn't say that.

24:43.748 --> 24:45.750
Then what are you saying?

24:46.618 --> 24:48.385
Well, you've been murdered,
Mr. Collins.

24:48.386 --> 24:51.122
You have less than 24 hours
to live.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.466
Well, I've notified
the authorities

25:02.467 --> 25:05.570
as this is a possible case
of homicide.

25:10.742 --> 25:14.079
Excuse... doc... doctor! Doctor?

25:19.251 --> 25:20.852
Doctor?

26:32.657 --> 26:36.293
What was your relationship
with Dr. Alexander?

26:36.294 --> 26:39.264
I was seeing him
for the last year.

26:40.031 --> 26:41.866
On a regular basis?

26:42.400 --> 26:45.904
Yes, for the most part.

26:45.971 --> 26:48.539
Were you involved in any
of his business dealings?

26:48.540 --> 26:50.908
I only knew about his
personal affairs

26:50.909 --> 26:53.144
when he chose to tell me.

26:53.778 --> 27:01.785
We would travel, go places,
you know, things of that nature.

27:01.786 --> 27:05.624
Who do you think would have
a motive to murder the doctor?

27:07.158 --> 27:08.860
I don't know.

27:09.461 --> 27:13.198
He kept his business private.
I can't say.

27:13.264 --> 27:18.836
Notice anything unusual,
strange lately?

27:18.837 --> 27:21.171
I organized
the New Years Eve party

27:21.172 --> 27:25.210
and I only invited
very close friends.

27:25.777 --> 27:30.882
He surprised me last minute,
told me he'd invited some man...

27:31.483 --> 27:32.716
Sam Collins.

27:32.717 --> 27:36.888
He's some sort
of pharmaceutical salesman.

27:37.922 --> 27:40.792
And did you meet this
Sam Collins?

27:41.960 --> 27:43.328
Yes.

27:54.806 --> 27:56.106
Deputy Renee.

27:56.107 --> 27:57.307
Hey, Billy, hey, uh...

27:57.308 --> 28:01.413
I heard you picked up
a Sam Collins today.

28:01.913 --> 28:04.348
Yeah, sure did, got him
in the hospital here.

28:04.349 --> 28:05.749
He's not doing too well, though.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.918
Yeah, man, you're not gonna
believe this

28:07.919 --> 28:09.219
but he's wanted in connection...

28:09.220 --> 28:12.223
with that murder
out at Alexander's.

28:14.693 --> 28:17.361
They want us to bring him
in, talk to him.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.896
Is that right?

28:18.897 --> 28:22.099
Hey, why don't you...
Why don't you go check on him.

28:22.100 --> 28:24.202
All right, I'll do that.

28:24.903 --> 28:27.371
Vincent Hospital,
how may I direct your call?

28:27.372 --> 28:29.074
I'll be right back.

28:52.664 --> 28:54.499
Well, I'll be damned.

29:32.303 --> 29:33.904
She holdin' something back.

29:33.905 --> 29:36.140
Here's the thing, this Sam
Collins she mentioned,

29:36.141 --> 29:39.143
had a hospital emergency visit
this morning, poisoning.

29:39.144 --> 29:42.847
He was picked up by Deputy Renee
on Blood River Road.

29:58.830 --> 30:00.397
All units, all units,

30:00.398 --> 30:04.168
please be advised, we have an
APB out for a Caucasian male...

30:04.169 --> 30:09.873
5'11", 180 pounds, black hair,
goes by the name Sam Collins.

30:09.874 --> 30:14.145
Last seen at Mercy Hospital
off Blood River Road.

30:38.937 --> 30:43.107
You need
anything, you come to me.

31:10.268 --> 31:12.703
Yeah, I gotta tell Sophie
to step it down a notch

31:12.704 --> 31:15.539
with this Christmas decorations,
it's driving me nuts!

31:15.540 --> 31:20.211
You ask me, it's kind of cozy,
reminds me of my mother's house.

31:27.852 --> 31:29.319
We got a problem.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.954
What's the problem?

31:30.955 --> 31:32.456
Doctor had an accident.

31:32.457 --> 31:33.490
He had an accident?

31:33.491 --> 31:36.327
Yeah, I don't think he made it.

31:36.928 --> 31:39.063
What the fuck you do?

31:39.264 --> 31:42.566
I didn't do anything, the cops
were all over the place.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.167
You didn't do anything?

31:44.168 --> 31:45.603
No.

31:46.938 --> 31:48.506
Hey.

31:51.943 --> 31:54.077
If it was up to me,
the doctor'd be taking

31:54.078 --> 31:55.145
a dirt nap a long time ago.

31:55.146 --> 31:56.813
He was taking us for a ride.
Us?

31:56.814 --> 31:59.082
We were never gonna see that money.
Mm-hm.

31:59.083 --> 32:03.720
Us? Since when is it us, huh?
Huh? I can't fucking hear you!

32:03.721 --> 32:04.955
Listen to me, you fucking moron!

32:04.956 --> 32:08.425
If you laid a fucking hand on
him, I'm gonna fucking kill you.

32:08.426 --> 32:09.327
You got that, all right?

32:09.328 --> 32:10.727
If I lose $2 million of my money

32:10.728 --> 32:12.296
because you decided to have
a fucking opinion.

32:12.297 --> 32:14.698
I'm gonna feed you
to the fucking alligators

32:14.699 --> 32:16.099
you stupid egret!

32:16.100 --> 32:17.100
I swear, I didn't do anything.

32:17.101 --> 32:20.438
You didn't do anything, huh?
Then who the fuck did?

32:21.606 --> 32:23.407
He didn't mean anything by it.

32:23.408 --> 32:25.876
You're responsible for this
bozo, you got that?

32:25.877 --> 32:27.277
Two million dollars of my
money's sitting

32:27.278 --> 32:29.379
in this fucking shit hole.
I need to know

32:29.380 --> 32:30.881
what the fuck is going on!

32:30.882 --> 32:32.649
Get my fucking money back!

32:32.650 --> 32:34.118
Understood.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.554
You've been warned.

32:39.757 --> 32:42.060
Namasté... breathe!

32:42.860 --> 32:44.495
Oh, god.

32:44.562 --> 32:45.929
What the fuck did you do?

32:45.930 --> 32:48.032
I didn't do anything.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.742
What's an egret?

33:42.387 --> 33:44.121
What are you doing?

33:44.122 --> 33:45.222
What?

33:45.223 --> 33:47.525
Put the fucking cigarette out.

33:48.092 --> 33:50.093
I'm relaxing.
Can I fucking relax?

33:50.094 --> 33:51.962
Why don't you just flash your
high beams

33:51.963 --> 33:54.432
and honk your horn
at the same time?

34:16.754 --> 34:19.989
Did you know they had
a big party here last night?

34:19.991 --> 34:24.429
Nothing good ever comes
from a big party.

34:35.239 --> 34:40.344
Excuse me, do you know
what's going on?

34:41.646 --> 34:45.583
Dr. Alexander has been murdered.

34:50.021 --> 34:52.623
Are you okay, mister?

34:55.592 --> 34:57.160
Do they know who did it?

34:57.161 --> 35:04.302
Well, I'm sure we will.
They are looking.

35:11.075 --> 35:12.743
Thank you.

Hey, you remember me?

37:18.336 --> 37:19.270
What are you doing here?

37:19.271 --> 37:22.707
Last night, you told me you
worked here.

37:23.140 --> 37:25.275
Look, if you're looking
for a relationship

37:25.276 --> 37:27.677
you will be sadly disappointed,
okay?

37:27.678 --> 37:29.981
I'm way past disappointed.

37:30.881 --> 37:33.116
I'm trying to work here.
What do you want?

37:33.117 --> 37:37.021
Look, okay, somebody's trying
to kill me.

37:38.122 --> 37:40.457
Okay, and I don't know who it
is, my guess is it's

37:40.458 --> 37:43.460
the same person who killed
Dr. Alexander, that friend

37:43.461 --> 37:44.862
of yours.

37:46.964 --> 37:49.766
I want no part of this, okay?

37:49.767 --> 37:52.403
Look, I know you don't know me.

37:53.704 --> 37:56.374
I'm dying, they poisoned me.

37:56.707 --> 37:59.442
I don't have anywhere else
to go.

37:59.443 --> 38:03.079
Okay, I need some help, and
you're the only person I know

38:03.080 --> 38:06.517
so if there's anything you can
do, please help.

38:09.620 --> 38:12.622
Bonnie arranges these
get togethers...

38:12.623 --> 38:14.324
and she hires the girls
from here.

38:14.325 --> 38:18.528
I was there to entertain,
nothing more, nothing less.

38:18.529 --> 38:22.232
Okay, and all the girls
are hired? Even Bonnie?

38:22.233 --> 38:24.335
Especially Bonnie.

38:25.436 --> 38:26.569
I did got a call from Bonnie.

38:26.570 --> 38:28.305
She told me what happened
to the doctor.

38:28.306 --> 38:31.008
Said the cops were looking
to talk to me.

38:31.108 --> 38:32.910
That's all I know.

38:34.078 --> 38:36.346
You should talk to Thomas.

38:36.347 --> 38:38.749
He was more involved
with the doctor.

38:39.083 --> 38:40.685
Thomas, who?

38:44.789 --> 38:46.056
The waiter, from last night?

38:46.057 --> 38:50.961
Yeah, hired by Bonnie.
He's more than a friend to her.

38:51.595 --> 38:55.099
Yeah, yeah, we're good.
Are you sure? All right.

38:55.366 --> 38:59.770
Everybody's got a transvestite
story around these parts.

39:01.672 --> 39:06.510
Hey, be careful, he's a
son-of-a-bitch.

39:11.148 --> 39:14.584
<i>♪ Get the honeys now
Get the honeys now ♪</i>

39:14.585 --> 39:17.887
<i>♪ Get the honeys now ♪</i>

39:17.888 --> 39:20.658
Excuse me, trying to pass.

39:22.093 --> 39:23.927
You recognize me?

39:23.928 --> 39:27.030
No, I don't know what you're
talking about.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.264
Yeah, I think you do.

39:28.265 --> 39:31.568
You mind telling me what the
hell you did to me last night?

39:31.569 --> 39:34.437
Look, baby, you're one of many
that I have served

39:34.438 --> 39:38.375
at the doctor's house,
I do as I am told.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.076
And I don't appreciate you
accusing me

39:40.077 --> 39:42.011
of whatever the hell it is
you're talking about.

39:42.012 --> 39:44.848
Now if you don't mind,
I'm working.

39:44.849 --> 39:46.683
Listen, you better stop
fucking with me!

39:46.684 --> 39:48.618
Okay, you were pouring
the drinks last night

39:48.619 --> 39:51.087
so either you poisoned me
or you know who did.

39:51.088 --> 39:53.189
I said get the fuck
out of my way!

39:53.190 --> 39:54.791
Listen, put your fucking
drinks...

39:54.792 --> 39:56.359
I'll fuck you up!

39:56.360 --> 39:58.328
You're in the wrong place!

40:26.357 --> 40:27.958
Thomas!

40:36.734 --> 40:38.502
Thomas!

40:42.039 --> 40:43.574
Thomas!

40:47.411 --> 40:50.114
Thom... oh...

40:50.514 --> 40:53.484
Thomas, look, I know you can
hear me.

40:54.418 --> 40:57.121
I just want to get home
to my family.

42:11.295 --> 42:15.532
Hey... you said
you were quittin'.

42:15.533 --> 42:18.835
Yeah, I was gonna, but...
And I didn't.

42:18.836 --> 42:20.871
I can help you with that.

42:21.705 --> 42:23.641
Yeah, you could.

42:34.285 --> 42:37.720
Hey... you've gotta get out
of here, you're in danger.

42:37.721 --> 42:40.291
Doesn't matter, I'm a dead man,
anyway.

42:42.359 --> 42:44.228
C'mon, let's go.

42:53.137 --> 42:55.806
Hey, take this.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.310
Then why are we running
from that cop?

43:00.311 --> 43:03.413
Every time we've had a private
gathering at Dr. Alexander's

43:03.414 --> 43:06.083
that cop has been there,
guarding the place.

43:06.817 --> 43:10.320
Okay, well, I... was he there
last night?

43:10.321 --> 43:11.989
Yes, he was.

43:12.056 --> 43:13.023
I didn't see him.

43:13.023 --> 43:13.991
Yeah, of course you didn't.

43:13.992 --> 43:16.894
You were too busy trying to get
in my pants, get in.

43:17.695 --> 43:19.597
What the fuck?

43:33.744 --> 43:36.312
Where are we going?
To see Agrona.

43:36.313 --> 43:39.816
She's the only one I know who
can either cure you

43:39.817 --> 43:43.253
or tell you about the poison
in your body.

43:54.565 --> 43:55.299
We have a match.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.533
Hang on, gotta send this text.

43:57.534 --> 44:00.371
"You... fucking... hag."

44:00.671 --> 44:04.207
What can I say, happy wife,
happy life, right? Whaddaya got?

44:04.208 --> 44:07.010
The vehicle we recovered which
was rented by Sam Collins,

44:07.011 --> 44:08.878
is missing a tire iron,
single-socket.

44:08.879 --> 44:11.180
Now we checked the murder weapon
with the lug nut size

44:11.181 --> 44:15.185
of the tires on that vehicle,
it's a match.

44:15.786 --> 44:17.186
Lug nut size?

44:17.187 --> 44:17.855
Yes, sir.

44:17.856 --> 44:20.390
You're saying there's variation
in lug nut sizes?

44:20.391 --> 44:24.027
Yeah, 17mm, 19mm, 21, etcetera.

44:24.028 --> 44:24.895
Lug nuts are standard.

44:24.896 --> 44:27.530
How's Triple A gonna carry seven
different wrenches around

44:27.531 --> 44:28.399
to change your tire?

44:28.400 --> 44:30.366
Well, they usually carry one
of those four-way tire irons

44:30.367 --> 44:34.404
or an impact wrench to cover
the four or five standard sizes.

44:34.405 --> 44:37.708
Uh-huh... you study wrenches
at LSU?

44:37.875 --> 44:40.243
No, just women and gumbo.

44:40.244 --> 44:41.577
Hey, let me ask you something.

44:41.578 --> 44:43.813
Does it bother you that
the most famous Armenian

44:43.814 --> 44:46.316
of all time is Kim Kardashian?

44:46.550 --> 44:49.352
Now think about it, thousands
of years of history,

44:49.353 --> 44:50.920
the Greeks got Aristotle,

44:50.921 --> 44:53.222
the Italians, they got
Christopher Columbus,

44:53.223 --> 44:56.726
Irish got St. Patrick
and Liam Neeson.

44:56.727 --> 44:59.730
Y'all is stuck with Kim
and Kanye.

45:00.998 --> 45:03.900
What do you want to do
about Sam Collins?

45:03.901 --> 45:06.202
We may be able to bring
him in on probable cause

45:06.203 --> 45:07.137
off the missing tire iron.

45:07.138 --> 45:09.707
Get with the DA's office
and make it so.

45:09.773 --> 45:10.773
Done.

45:10.774 --> 45:12.976
Thank you, Kanye.

45:28.692 --> 45:31.795
He's...
Psst! Talk inside, come in.

45:34.331 --> 45:36.166
Sit in the chair.

45:40.404 --> 45:42.605
You took a risk bringing
this man here.

45:42.606 --> 45:45.341
I know, I'm so sorry I didn't
let you know before

45:45.342 --> 45:47.210
but I didn't know who else
to call.

45:47.211 --> 45:51.248
Conserve your energy,
you will need it.

45:51.482 --> 45:53.583
What's that, what's...?

45:56.253 --> 46:02.226
This place... is filled
with spirits.

46:03.160 --> 46:06.829
Slaves were tortured, hung...

46:06.830 --> 46:11.769
and killed right here in this
room by their masters.

46:13.637 --> 46:16.373
But you are in good company.

46:18.342 --> 46:22.079
The spirits are waiting for you!

46:23.680 --> 46:26.917
He does not have long.

46:27.251 --> 46:29.986
This is bullshit, I don't need
to hear this.

46:29.987 --> 46:33.090
Sam... Sam!

46:35.159 --> 46:37.494
I can relieve your pain.

46:38.729 --> 46:42.732
The pain you are suffering in
your deteriorated intestines.

46:42.733 --> 46:44.201
Sit down.

46:45.569 --> 46:47.938
You have nowhere to go.

46:55.379 --> 46:58.282
I am not the one who killed you.

47:04.621 --> 47:06.190
It's okay.

47:08.125 --> 47:09.827
Drink.

47:10.828 --> 47:11.994
What is that?

47:11.995 --> 47:17.034
Sam, she is trying to help you,
please.

47:26.276 --> 47:30.279
The poison that is killing you,
was purchased from me.

47:30.280 --> 47:31.380
What?

47:31.381 --> 47:35.252
Your lover has been sacrificed.

47:35.352 --> 47:37.887
You are too late to his rescue.

47:37.888 --> 47:41.158
I don't feel so good.

47:50.601 --> 47:54.371
I don't feel good. I don't know
what's happening right now.

48:01.745 --> 48:03.981
What are you doing?

48:05.182 --> 48:08.218
Sending him off to the spirits.

48:18.395 --> 48:22.332
Hey, Jen... I'm coming home.

48:56.133 --> 48:57.634
Prick.

50:04.234 --> 50:07.169
You have to leave!
Whoa... whoa.

50:07.170 --> 50:08.739
He's here.

50:11.575 --> 50:15.312
Take him, leave out
the back door now!

50:15.912 --> 50:16.613
Okay, okay.

50:16.614 --> 50:19.682
You have to leave!
Okay, Sam, Sam!

50:19.683 --> 50:21.251
Wake up!

50:22.419 --> 50:24.620
Sam, we've got to go!
Get up!

50:24.621 --> 50:27.223
You have to leave!
Wake up, Sam, we've got to go!

50:27.224 --> 50:31.728
Okay? Now up you go.
All right, let's go.

50:32.529 --> 50:34.663
See you in the next life.

50:34.664 --> 50:37.501
Agrona, thank you!

50:37.768 --> 50:39.369
Go, go!

50:40.003 --> 50:41.605
Come on.

50:59.790 --> 51:01.658
The tires are slashed.

51:01.992 --> 51:02.592
Fuck!

51:02.593 --> 51:05.161
How'd the cop know we were here?
She sold us out.

51:05.162 --> 51:06.696
No, she didn't.

51:13.637 --> 51:14.904
Mornin' sweetheart!

51:17.274 --> 51:19.942
I need to freshen up.
Give me a minute.

51:19.943 --> 51:21.944
No, it's fine, I'll wait inside.
Thank you, though.

51:21.945 --> 51:24.381
Go freshen up, you're good.

51:27.384 --> 51:30.520
What are you doing here
so early?

51:30.687 --> 51:33.857
I had a dream about you,
that you'd run away

51:33.957 --> 51:34.791
and I couldn't find you.

51:34.792 --> 51:37.693
So, I figured I'd come check
for myself.

51:37.694 --> 51:41.131
And how does your wife feel
about that?

51:41.731 --> 51:43.633
Oh, she's fine.

51:47.804 --> 51:49.805
Excuse me!
Yeah?

51:49.806 --> 51:51.507
Hey, can we get a ride with you?

51:51.508 --> 51:53.275
Uh... sure, where you goin'?

51:53.276 --> 51:56.712
That poison didn't work the way
that you said it would.

51:56.713 --> 51:58.047
All right, now he's running all
over town.

51:58.048 --> 52:00.583
It's just a matter of time 'til
people figure out what went on.

52:00.584 --> 52:04.621
You in trouble, boy,
and you know it.

52:04.688 --> 52:08.658
Come on in, man.
All right. Thanks.

52:09.359 --> 52:12.394
You've invited evil to your
doorstep!

52:12.395 --> 52:14.463
It's playing right now
with your children

52:14.464 --> 52:16.031
on that playground you've built
with dirty money.

52:16.032 --> 52:18.434
Don't talk about my family,
you voodoo bitch!

52:19.836 --> 52:26.209
Your family is doomed and it's
all because of you, dirty cop!

52:49.599 --> 52:53.436
Hey, Bobby, hell of a way
to start the year, huh?

52:53.537 --> 52:55.004
That's body number two.

52:55.005 --> 52:57.806
This guy Thomas has been known
to get around

52:57.807 --> 52:59.141
a little sexual weasel.

52:59.142 --> 53:01.877
We found his phone on the boat,
it's got pictures on there...

53:01.878 --> 53:04.113
that place him at the doctor's
party that night.

53:04.114 --> 53:04.881
Anything good?

53:04.882 --> 53:07.283
Yeah, I got some screenshots.

53:07.284 --> 53:11.787
Dr. Alexander, some strippers,
our suspect Sam Collins

53:11.788 --> 53:14.757
and one Hans Dunkle,
insurance agent,

53:14.758 --> 53:16.258
all engaged in sexual acts.

53:16.259 --> 53:19.962
Aw, this guy's a freak,
kinda like Khloe, huh?

53:19.963 --> 53:22.832
Your second most
famous Armenian.

53:26.870 --> 53:29.638
Some witnesses saw Sam Collins
at the Fun House last night

53:29.639 --> 53:31.974
around the same time
as the murder.

53:31.975 --> 53:32.776
Of course, he was.

53:32.777 --> 53:34.843
The guy's poisoned, knows he's
gonna die

53:34.844 --> 53:37.714
yet he keeps popping up places
where there's bodies.

53:38.114 --> 53:40.550
Fuck!

53:47.123 --> 53:48.858
Hey, pretty lady.

53:48.959 --> 53:51.294
What happened to Thomas?

53:52.028 --> 53:53.596
What'd ya'll do to him?

53:53.597 --> 53:57.400
Listen, uh, I can't talk
right now.

53:58.768 --> 54:01.604
I'm being questioned
by the police.

54:01.605 --> 54:04.941
What kind of mess did you
get me into?

54:05.208 --> 54:06.508
Listen, I'm gonna take care
of it, okay?

54:06.509 --> 54:10.447
You don't... don't worry your
little, bitty head, okay?

54:11.448 --> 54:12.481
I didn't sign up for this!

54:12.482 --> 54:15.385
Keep your fucking mouth shut,
all right!

54:39.209 --> 54:39.909
Just a trooper.

54:39.910 --> 54:42.712
I'll get my usual, please.
Sure thing!

54:46.650 --> 54:48.551
What time do you got?

54:48.918 --> 54:50.552
I don't wear a watch.

54:50.553 --> 54:52.221
How do you tell time?

54:52.222 --> 54:56.026
Time is uh...
time is an illusion.

54:59.095 --> 55:00.529
I never thought of it that way!

55:00.530 --> 55:03.032
You know, if you had anything
to do with the doctor

55:03.033 --> 55:05.134
you know he's gonna find out,
right?

55:05.135 --> 55:06.468
Is that so?

55:06.469 --> 55:07.971
Yeah.

55:08.238 --> 55:09.738
Let me tell you something.

55:09.739 --> 55:10.939
When we first got down here,

55:10.940 --> 55:13.142
the Doc was in bad shape
financially.

55:13.143 --> 55:14.443
He was working on some kind
of vaccine,

55:14.444 --> 55:16.779
state-of-the-art shit, he was
introduced to Vince

55:16.780 --> 55:19.382
by one of our guys
at the casino.

55:19.482 --> 55:21.650
It was an easy mark
to turn cash.

55:21.651 --> 55:22.619
Why are you telling me this?

55:22.620 --> 55:25.854
I was the one who was supposed
to be running shit down here.

55:25.855 --> 55:27.156
So you did kill him?

55:27.157 --> 55:27.991
I didn't say that.

55:27.992 --> 55:32.028
You think you're qualified
to run a medical operation?

55:32.529 --> 55:33.296
Yeah.

55:33.297 --> 55:35.465
What makes you qualified?

55:35.765 --> 55:37.666
My sister is a nurse.

55:37.667 --> 55:40.370
Your sister is a nurse, oh.

55:41.404 --> 55:44.441
Hey, honey!
Hey, Mr. Dunkle.

55:49.546 --> 55:52.715
Hey, Mr. Dunkle! How you doing?
Good morning!

55:52.716 --> 55:55.351
Officer Renee, how you doin',
bud?

55:55.352 --> 55:58.087
Doing good, just grabbing
a little lunch-time grub.

55:58.088 --> 55:59.955
I hope you're happy with your
insurance policy

55:59.956 --> 56:02.491
because I sure am happy
with your business.

56:02.492 --> 56:03.226
Absolutely.

56:03.227 --> 56:04.727
Yeah, you know, I can't thank
you enough, actually.

56:04.728 --> 56:07.096
You know, with the recent floods
and all...

56:07.097 --> 56:08.130
it's nice to have peace of mind.

56:08.131 --> 56:12.034
Hey, wish your lady a happy,
happy New Year for me!

56:12.035 --> 56:15.571
<i>♪ Should auld acquaintance
Be forgot and never ♪</i>

56:15.572 --> 56:19.108
What are you gonna serenade me?
Whatever you want, buddy.

56:19.109 --> 56:24.047
Hey, listen, wait a minute, did
you hear about Dr. Alexander?

56:24.547 --> 56:27.549
Well, you missed a helluva
party, that's for sure!

56:27.550 --> 56:30.853
What, did somebody, uh,
call the cops?

56:32.355 --> 56:35.725
No, no, he was found dead
in his boat.

56:36.860 --> 56:37.960
You're kidding!

56:37.961 --> 56:39.896
Come on, bud.

56:40.430 --> 56:44.833
All right, town's about a mile
south of here.

56:44.834 --> 56:47.035
Thanks again.
You're welcome, good luck.

56:47.036 --> 56:48.571
Thank you.

57:05.488 --> 57:06.289
What?

57:06.290 --> 57:08.458
I think we got something.

57:27.310 --> 57:29.913
The cops are looking for you.

57:33.149 --> 57:35.685
I know a place we can go to.

57:47.897 --> 57:53.603
This is it... fancy, huh?

57:56.105 --> 57:58.541
Hey, come, let's sit.

58:09.219 --> 58:13.256
Nothin' good ever comes out
of that Bonnie, I'll tell ya.

58:13.756 --> 58:15.891
What are you doing in this town?

58:15.892 --> 58:17.493
I came here for work.

58:17.494 --> 58:23.666
I grew up in Breaux Bridge,
crawfish capital of the world.

58:23.733 --> 58:27.003
There's not much there
for a girl like me.

58:28.304 --> 58:30.240
Do you have family here?

58:30.773 --> 58:36.779
Got a mother, older sister,
she left when she was 17.

58:37.614 --> 58:40.382
My uh... my Mom lives with her
boyfriend

58:40.383 --> 58:43.953
who's a pretty, nice guy when
he's not drinkin'.

59:11.147 --> 59:13.849
Detectives, thanks for coming!

59:13.850 --> 59:15.284
Well, thank you for taking
the time

59:15.285 --> 59:17.654
to meet with us, Mr. Dunkle.

59:23.726 --> 59:27.396
I still can't... take this
all in.

59:27.397 --> 59:30.933
Why don't you start by telling
us about New Year's Eve?

59:30.934 --> 59:35.804
Well, I got an invitation
from Dr. Alexander

59:35.805 --> 59:37.039
for a gathering at his house.

59:37.040 --> 59:38.874
How many people were
at the party?

59:38.875 --> 59:42.344
It was not a big gathering,
it was a small group.

59:42.345 --> 59:44.279
When did you first meet
Dr. Alexander?

59:44.280 --> 59:47.783
About eight years ago, when he
divorced his second wife,

59:47.784 --> 59:53.088
he wanted me to insure his toys,
his cars, boats, etcetera.

59:53.089 --> 59:55.257
Based on our records,
Dr. Alexander gave you

59:55.258 --> 59:56.959
all his insurance business
over time.

59:56.960 --> 59:59.861
Well, I provide a good service,
detective.

59:59.862 --> 01:00:01.430
Tell us about the other night?

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:06.102
Well, Dr. Alexander invited me
to his house...

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:07.736
invited some ladies.

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:09.471
Can you give us some names?

01:00:09.472 --> 01:00:12.774
Of course,
Bonnie Jules, who's dated

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:15.344
the doctor off and on for many
years, she was there

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:17.846
and she invited some friends
of hers, some ladies.

01:00:17.847 --> 01:00:19.648
Did you know any of them
previously?

01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:24.453
I did, many of them work
at the Fun House off the river.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:28.625
So, it's you, the doctor,
the ladies, anyone else?

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:31.493
Oh, just the usual people,
the next-door neighbors,

01:00:31.494 --> 01:00:34.296
another guy across the street,
John, and, ah,

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:36.264
a pharmaceutical salesman,

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:39.768
who was doing a deal
with the doctor, a Sam Collins.

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:43.906
Approximately what time did you
leave the party?

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:48.644
I left the house around 3:15...

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:53.716
I passed out on the couch,
and when I woke up...

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:57.085
I took a bottle off the table
and I went home.

01:00:57.086 --> 01:01:00.288
You didn't notice anything
suspicious or strange?

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:02.824
No, um, I didn't notice
anything.

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:06.161
I figured whoever was there
was still asleep.

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:07.896
Mr. Dunkle, can you think
of anyone

01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:09.831
who might have had a motive
to kill the doctor?

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:14.771
No, Dr. Alexander never had any
enemies, not that I'm aware of.

01:01:16.572 --> 01:01:18.341
Anything else?

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.276
I think I'm good.

01:01:20.543 --> 01:01:22.145
Me, too.

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:28.083
Agassi.

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:31.086
What?
Andre Agassi, he's Armenian.

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:36.092
He won the French Open,
the U.S. Open and Wimbledon.

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:42.298
Tennis don't count.

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:57.747
This is the insurance agent
that was at the party.

01:01:58.114 --> 01:02:01.416
Yea, Hans Dunkle,
he's a fucking perv.

01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:03.218
Why do you say that?

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:03.920
He's a regular.

01:02:03.921 --> 01:02:06.988
He's always trying to pick up
on the new girls at the club.

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:08.757
Is he close with the doctor?

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:11.660
Him and the doctor have been
swinging swingers

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:13.328
for a long time.

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:14.763
Do you know where he lives?

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:17.132
Where is my lipstick?
Hey!

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:19.801
Yeah, he's, uh,
he's in Bruce's Harbor.

01:02:19.802 --> 01:02:23.206
It's a few streets from where
we were last night.

01:02:23.339 --> 01:02:24.207
And you can show me?

01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:27.342
Yeah, it's easy,
it's #11 Country Club Road.

01:02:27.343 --> 01:02:29.778
I need to talk to him.
Be careful.

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:42.825
So, listen, okay? I...

01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:48.231
Thank you, for everything
that you've done for me.

01:02:49.665 --> 01:02:52.167
I don't want to drag you
into this anymore.

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:54.437
I'm not your responsibility!

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:56.738
Hey, hold your horses!

01:02:56.739 --> 01:03:00.143
I'm not doing this
because you told me to.

01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:03.913
I'm doing this
because I want to.

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:27.803
If we follow Blood River, we'll
get to Dunkle's house.

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:36.345
Come!

01:03:50.927 --> 01:03:53.162
Come on, this way!

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:06.609
All right... sh.

01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:14.150
Sam Collins, you got a warrant
for your arrest.

01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:26.863
Why don't you go ahead and come
on out, make things easy on you.

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:38.007
This isn't gonna go away, Sam.

01:04:40.476 --> 01:04:42.645
I'm here to help you.

01:04:44.213 --> 01:04:47.250
Sam, why don't you come on down
to the station,

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:53.355
we'll get it all sorted out,
and we'll get you taken care of.

01:04:58.261 --> 01:05:00.630
You seem like a nice guy.

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:14.309
I saw you run in here...
and I'm trying to be friendly.

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:20.316
You remind me of me a li'l bit,
tough, good looking.

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:31.127
You back here?

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:38.100
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:01.756
You can't run from the law
and go unscathed.

01:06:01.757 --> 01:06:04.493
That's not how it works.
Come on, Jessie.

01:06:12.234 --> 01:06:14.302
Why are you doing this to me?

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:16.504
I'm not doing anything
to you, kid.

01:06:16.505 --> 01:06:19.208
You're not gonna get away
with this.

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:24.179
You poisoned me.

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:27.249
You got me confused
with somebody else.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:37.126
Look, man, I got a family,
I gotta take care of my family.

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:41.063
Oh, you lookin' at it?

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:48.404
You want it? Take it.

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:50.673
End yourself.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.209
Go ahead, come on.

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:55.143
Okay, get up, let's go.

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:57.380
No... mm-mm.
Get up!

01:07:00.249 --> 01:07:02.517
I'd hate to have to go visit
your wife.

01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:03.252
I'll kill you.

01:07:03.253 --> 01:07:06.155
Don't fucking come near me,
walk that way.

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:30.513
Keep walking, come on.

01:07:34.984 --> 01:07:39.921
Way I figure it is, you came
here, you killed the stripper

01:07:39.922 --> 01:07:43.225
with the heart of gold,
because she poisoned you.

01:07:43.325 --> 01:07:49.065
You succumbed to your pain,
killed yourself.

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:53.469
You just happened to be the guy!

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:56.439
Shit luck, I guess.

01:08:05.381 --> 01:08:06.816
Walker!

01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:11.120
What's going on here?

01:08:12.721 --> 01:08:16.691
Renee, I'm uh... I'm glad
you're here.

01:08:16.692 --> 01:08:18.893
I caught the murder suspect.

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:20.662
What are you doing with him?

01:08:20.662 --> 01:08:22.765
Uh, he ran, I caught him.

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:24.631
Why don't he have cuffs on?

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:27.402
Uh, I hadn't gotten there yet.

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:30.572
Why don't you go call it in!
I'll be right out.

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:33.809
That's all right, I'll help you
take him in.

01:08:39.548 --> 01:08:41.684
Billy, go call it in.

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:54.330
Are we gonna have a problem
here?

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:05.207
No... no problem.

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:09.511
Tell you what, I'll go call it
in. I'll just be outside.

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:11.913
That's swell, you do that.

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:38.874
Shit!

01:09:40.776 --> 01:09:42.211
Shit!

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:46.635
What do people do around here?

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:49.505
I'd be bored out of my mind.

01:11:50.372 --> 01:11:53.875
You know, you haven't shut up
since we got down here.

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:56.577
Sometimes I think the universe
puts me with you

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:58.847
just to test my patience.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:57.473
<i>♪ Duh-duh-nuh-nuh-duh ♪</i>

01:13:00.142 --> 01:13:04.480
<i>♪ Baby baby baby baby yeah ♪</i>

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:18.660
He's got music playing.

01:13:24.099 --> 01:13:24.967
Huh?
Uh-uh.

01:13:24.968 --> 01:13:28.804
Who wants some? Oh, no, baby!

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:10.879
What?

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:15.450
All right, let's pick him up.
We'll bring him outs...

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:17.152
What about her?

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:21.723
She wasn't part of the deal.

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.697
Yeah, but she's seen who we are.

01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:41.777
Grab the motherfucker, come on.

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:28.115
A neighbor saw two men break
into Dunkle's house.

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:29.851
Called it in.

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:24.805
Hey, partner, we got
a problem...

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:28.309
Paxil, Khedezla, Chlorpromazine,
Lithium.

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:32.046
Chlorpromazine, holy shit,
that's some bad medicine.

01:17:32.047 --> 01:17:36.017
All prescribed to Hans Dunkle
from Dr. Alexander.

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:38.887
Is he treating him like
a mental patient?

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:41.922
That stuff is used to treat
severe disorders...

01:17:41.923 --> 01:17:44.359
bipolar and psychotic behavior.

01:17:45.293 --> 01:17:49.664
Dr. Alexander was in medical
R & D, specializing in vaccines.

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:52.233
What the fuck was he doing
passing out meds like that

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:53.534
to his insurance agent?

01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:00.509
Naroyan.

01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:03.110
Yeah, hi, Detective Naroyan,
this is Dr. Kazan.

01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:06.180
I treated your suspect
Sam Collins 24 hours ago.

01:18:06.181 --> 01:18:08.816
As you may know, he's been
poisoned.

01:18:08.817 --> 01:18:10.184
Technically, he should've
been dead

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:13.021
within the first few hours
of the intake.

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:17.058
What kind of dumb ass don't
password protect?

01:18:17.059 --> 01:18:19.126
Well, I'm calling to see
if he's still alive?

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:21.028
Based on our information,
yes, he is.

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:23.898
Okay, our initial test results
indicated organ failure

01:18:23.899 --> 01:18:26.634
but if he survived the last
24 hours, then there's a good

01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:30.304
chance that he can live with
immediate medical attention.

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:31.840
Last call.

01:18:43.652 --> 01:18:46.721
How many times I tell you, if I
don't pick up, I'm busy.

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:49.690
What do you need? I'm dealing
with a shit storm right now!

01:18:49.691 --> 01:18:54.463
Officer Walker, this is
Detective Spiro, Homicide.

01:18:56.131 --> 01:18:58.133
You got the wrong number.

01:19:06.441 --> 01:19:07.608
Fuck!

01:19:07.609 --> 01:19:09.276
All patrol cars have GPS.

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:10.444
Let's find out a little
something

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:13.714
about Officer Walker's
whereabouts the last 24 hours.

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:58.794
Come on.

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:02.197
Let's do this the easy way, huh?
Get in.

01:20:11.106 --> 01:20:13.941
I'm doing the best that I can.

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:20.949
I'm sorry, give the kids
a kiss for me... I love you.

01:21:03.892 --> 01:21:07.095
Get down... get down.

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:12.200
It's gone too far.

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:29.284
It's a fucking swamp rat.

01:21:37.792 --> 01:21:40.427
He made me do it, I didn't
want to fucking do it.

01:21:40.428 --> 01:21:45.100
I didn't want to fucking do it.
I didn't want to kill anybody.

01:21:49.838 --> 01:21:52.073
God knows, I tried.

01:21:56.311 --> 01:21:58.413
Feed him to the hogs.

01:21:59.614 --> 01:22:01.449
Get him on his feet.

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:19.334
You are one unlucky S.O.B,
you know that?

01:22:23.872 --> 01:22:25.473
This guy talk?

01:22:26.574 --> 01:22:28.243
Suppose so.

01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:37.986
You're the guy from the church.

01:22:41.122 --> 01:22:44.125
Looks like your prayers
have been answered.

01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:55.637
Fuck.

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:05.113
They did a number on you, kid,
didn't they?

01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:12.754
I'm not gonna kill you.

01:23:13.955 --> 01:23:16.390
Sorry you're gonna die,
but that's neither here or there

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:18.660
based on what I've been told.

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:23.264
It's this piece of shit I've
been after all along.

01:23:27.235 --> 01:23:31.373
You have no idea what's going
on here, do you?

01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:37.612
Well, you deserve to know,
I mean, it's only right.

01:23:38.413 --> 01:23:40.448
Get him a bottle of water.

01:23:44.486 --> 01:23:47.354
You see, the good doctor,
was a piece of shit

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:49.089
and a degenerate gambler.

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:51.625
And he was into me
for two million dollars.

01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:52.760
Now the businessman that I am,

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:56.564
I decided to give him one more
chance to pay me back.

01:23:57.766 --> 01:23:59.800
He signs the deal
with VaxCorp...

01:23:59.801 --> 01:24:03.404
he takes the contract
to the bank, gets a loan on it,

01:24:03.405 --> 01:24:06.808
pays me back
and everybody's happy.

01:24:08.109 --> 01:24:10.245
But that didn't happen.

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:13.214
And here we are!

01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:18.520
I guess it wasn't in the cards.

01:24:20.088 --> 01:24:24.392
Come on, I want you to meet
somebody.

01:24:34.102 --> 01:24:39.607
Hello, my friend... You thought
I forgot about you.

01:24:40.008 --> 01:24:41.675
Not today, today!

01:24:41.676 --> 01:24:44.546
Today, Hans, is your birthday.

01:24:46.948 --> 01:24:49.217
I got a few gifts for you.

01:24:51.619 --> 01:24:55.656
That prick poisoned you
and killed the doctor

01:24:55.657 --> 01:24:58.526
and two million dollars
of my money.

01:24:59.694 --> 01:25:00.261
Why?

01:25:00.262 --> 01:25:06.300
Why? Why? Why, Hans? Why, Hans?
Why did you do it?

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:09.770
Why'd you do it, Hans?
Why? Why'd you do it, huh?

01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:11.638
Fuck you!
Fuck me?

01:25:11.639 --> 01:25:13.174
Fuck you!

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:16.543
Dr. Alexander has been treating
this clown

01:25:16.544 --> 01:25:18.479
as a mental patient for years.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.414
The doctor was creating
a monster

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:22.517
and he didn't even know it.

01:25:25.386 --> 01:25:29.490
You see his eyes? Look at that,
Little Frankenstein.

01:25:29.491 --> 01:25:32.794
Oh, you know, I almost feel
bad for him.

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:35.763
He's all sedated and fucked up.

01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:46.241
I understand you, Hans,
I get it.

01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:49.911
You see, the doctor liked
the skanks.

01:25:50.445 --> 01:25:52.914
Hans over here knew the skanks.

01:25:53.081 --> 01:25:54.916
You see what's going on?

01:25:55.049 --> 01:25:56.851
Unfortunately for us...

01:25:57.018 --> 01:26:01.856
the good doctor underestimated
Hans Dunkle.

01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:06.694
Oh yeah, Hans hated the doctor.

01:26:07.495 --> 01:26:08.996
It was like a bad marriage,
you know?

01:26:08.997 --> 01:26:12.232
Add a dirty cop in the mix, you
got yourself a fucking quandary.

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:14.768
You think about it, he tried
to kill you, Sam,

01:26:14.769 --> 01:26:17.539
to pin the doctor's murder
on you.

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:24.212
You want a sip?
No.

01:26:24.412 --> 01:26:27.482
Oh, it's okay, Hans,
you can have a sip.

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.388
Yeah, that's nice, right?

01:26:34.389 --> 01:26:38.259
Pretty good stuff, huh?
Takes the edge off.

01:26:39.761 --> 01:26:41.428
What'd you think was gonna
happen today?

01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:43.965
I told you it was your fucking
birthday!

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:46.568
Finish him.

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:58.478
Listen, I do this all the time.

01:26:58.479 --> 01:27:00.814
The first time is hard,
but then you get used to it.

01:27:00.815 --> 01:27:02.149
It's really not that big
of a deal.

01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:03.917
I'm gonna feed you
to the fucking turtles

01:27:03.918 --> 01:27:05.787
when I'm done with you!

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:09.423
Go ahead, it's okay, take care
of it. You deserve it.

01:27:09.424 --> 01:27:12.560
This is your chance, make it
happen, go.

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:18.466
Don't do it, don't do it,
don't shoot me.

01:27:18.666 --> 01:27:22.369
Don't shoot me, I didn't know
what I was doing?

01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:27.008
I didn't mean it... I was high
when the shit went down!

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:28.743
I didn't mean it!

01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:32.479
It was Walker! It was fucking
Walker's...

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:34.948
Sam! Listen, Sam! Sam, it was
Walker!

01:27:34.949 --> 01:27:37.752
It was Walker's idea to pin it
on you.

01:27:40.154 --> 01:27:43.625
Don't kill me, please don't kill
me, please don't kill me!

01:27:44.525 --> 01:27:47.728
Sam, vaccines kill people, you
don't kill people!

01:27:47.729 --> 01:27:49.029
You don't kill people.

01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:52.400
You don't kill people!
You don't kill people!

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:57.705
You don't kill people!
You don't kill people.

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:12.287
Give me the gun.

01:28:16.157 --> 01:28:17.824
Go see your family.

01:28:23.231 --> 01:28:24.666
Go.

01:28:39.647 --> 01:28:41.315
I got news for you, Hans.

01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:46.854
Vaccines don't kill people,
people kill people.

01:28:49.957 --> 01:28:51.659
Enjoy the ride.

01:29:01.269 --> 01:29:03.904
Help me! Help me!
Help me!

01:29:03.905 --> 01:29:06.606
Help me! Don't leave me here!

01:29:06.607 --> 01:29:10.944
I was high when the shit
went down!

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:12.913
Don't... don't leave me!

01:29:12.914 --> 01:29:16.617
Don't... baby, baby...

01:29:31.432 --> 01:29:32.799
So, we're done here?

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:35.703
Yeah... we're done.

01:29:36.003 --> 01:29:37.672
What about Hans?

01:29:37.739 --> 01:29:40.441
I gave him some of his own
medicine.

01:29:40.675 --> 01:29:42.410
Give it a few minutes.

01:30:45.072 --> 01:30:46.474
Uh-oh.

01:31:30.785 --> 01:31:32.587
Hello, Sam Collins.

01:32:26.807 --> 01:32:32.880
Is he... is he alive?

01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:39.186
Why don't you tell us
the real story?
