WEBVTT

00:04.395 --> 00:07.007
- Make sure the negotiator
pushes for maternity leave.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.095
That's important--
and holiday pay.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.444
Here, to remind you.

00:09.487 --> 00:11.402
- It's all
in the union proposal,

00:11.446 --> 00:12.838
so I don't think I'll need
a reminder.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.362
Huh, cinnamon.

00:14.405 --> 00:16.059
I'm intrigued by
the non-peppermints.

00:16.103 --> 00:17.930
Where is Sandra?

00:17.974 --> 00:19.193
- Are you sure
she's really coming?

00:19.236 --> 00:20.672
Maybe you should just
leave without her.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.718
-  They said
bring two store reps.

00:22.761 --> 00:25.460
Plus, she yelled "dibs" so loud
at that meeting.

00:25.503 --> 00:28.071
- Oh, Jonah,
little negotiating tip--

00:28.115 --> 00:30.204
walk away so they know
you're serious.

00:30.247 --> 00:31.553
When I bought my Corolla,

00:31.596 --> 00:34.556
I hid in the bathroom
for hours.

00:34.599 --> 00:37.907
- I will keep that
in my back pocket.

00:37.950 --> 00:40.692
You're so nervous right now.
- Yeah. No, I know.

00:40.736 --> 00:42.303
I just don't want them
to screw us

00:42.346 --> 00:43.869
and leave us
with no contract.

00:43.913 --> 00:45.132
- Hey, you didn't even think

00:45.175 --> 00:46.872
that they would sit down
with us, but they did,

00:46.916 --> 00:48.352
so obviously
they're scared.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.615
Relax. I honestly think this
is all gonna work out.

00:50.659 --> 00:52.574
- God, you really do,
don't you?

00:52.617 --> 00:54.010
So annoying.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.534
- Look, I really wish that you
could be there with us,

00:56.578 --> 00:58.580
and I promise to text you
updates as soon as I can.

00:58.623 --> 01:01.104
- Yes, please, even if it's
bad news, it's okay.

01:01.148 --> 01:03.454
And it might be good news,
in which case I'd be shocked,

01:03.498 --> 01:05.152
but, you know,
happy, obviously.

01:05.195 --> 01:06.283
Sorry I'm late.

01:06.327 --> 01:08.155
Jerry had never seen me
in a blazer,

01:08.198 --> 01:10.461
so the morning got
a little busy.

01:10.505 --> 01:13.116
- Cool.

01:17.947 --> 01:22.082
- Some of this stuff seems
too nice to be in clearance,

01:22.125 --> 01:24.171
like "Ottawa's
Tallest Buildings."

01:24.214 --> 01:26.129
- No, this junk needs
to go in the trash.

01:26.173 --> 01:27.870
Nobody's buying it.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.263
More like no one's selling it.

01:29.306 --> 01:31.178
Does anyone remember
when I worked here?

01:31.221 --> 01:32.918
Carts overflowed.

01:32.962 --> 01:35.138
Now I'm stuck watching you guys
blob around all day

01:35.182 --> 01:37.097
while I waste my talents
in the vision center.

01:37.140 --> 01:39.055
- Helping people see?
- I know.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.535
A dog can do it.

01:40.578 --> 01:42.885
- No one moved product like me
back at Sturgis & Sons.

01:42.928 --> 01:45.888
I even got a plaque that said,
"Dad's Number One Sales Boy."

01:45.931 --> 01:48.456
- I'm sure you were good,
like, back in the old days,

01:48.499 --> 01:51.111
but I'm just saying,
in modern times,

01:51.154 --> 01:53.243
I was the best salesperson
in the store.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.985
- I think I might still have
some moves left in me.

01:56.028 --> 01:57.508
In fact,
on a good blood-sugar day,

01:57.552 --> 01:58.814
I might even be
better than you.

01:58.857 --> 02:00.250
- Okay, Glenn.

02:00.294 --> 02:01.773
Why don't we pick out items
for each other?

02:01.817 --> 02:03.427
And if you sell yours first,

02:03.471 --> 02:06.822
I'll take over your bathroom
trash duty for three months.

02:06.865 --> 02:08.084
- Okay, I'm in.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.433
- You know what?
I'm in, too.

02:09.477 --> 02:11.261
Somebody's been putting

02:11.305 --> 02:13.307
what may or may not be
dog poop in that trash,

02:13.350 --> 02:14.395
and I'm gonna let one
of you guys

02:14.438 --> 02:16.440
figure out the mystery.

02:16.484 --> 02:17.833
- What's up with the tree?

02:17.876 --> 02:19.965
We doing a dystopian
nightmare Christmas this year?

02:20.009 --> 02:21.663
- No, some raccoons
just went HAM

02:21.706 --> 02:23.143
on it in storage.

02:23.186 --> 02:25.710
Oh, hey, so are Jonah
and Sandra there?

02:25.754 --> 02:27.756
- Yep, he's looking
for a parking spot right now.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.366
Stand by.
Stand by.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.063
Okay, great.
He's got one.

02:31.107 --> 02:33.153
- You doing okay with all this?

02:33.196 --> 02:35.242
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm totally fine. Why?

02:35.285 --> 02:36.634
- I just thought
it'd be tough for you.

02:36.678 --> 02:37.983
I mean, I know you like
being in control,

02:38.027 --> 02:39.463
and in this case, someone
so close to you

02:39.507 --> 02:40.899
gets to be there,
and it's like,

02:40.943 --> 02:42.510
"Is he gonna come through?"

02:42.553 --> 02:43.815
But I'm glad I'm wrong.

02:45.861 --> 02:47.428
- What happened to this tree?

02:47.471 --> 02:50.561
- Oh, seems like some raccoons
definitely had sex in it...

02:50.605 --> 02:53.085
or with it.

02:53.129 --> 02:54.348
- Georgia, hi.

02:54.391 --> 02:56.611
Jonah Simms
from Store 1217.

02:56.654 --> 02:59.266
- Oh, so good to meet you
in person.

02:59.309 --> 03:01.746
- You look just like you sound.

03:01.790 --> 03:04.227
- Yeah, I-I get that a lot
for some reason.

03:04.271 --> 03:07.317
Um, Georgia
is kind of a legend.

03:07.361 --> 03:10.494
She's won, like,
a dozen union contracts.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.540
Really, it's amazing work
that you're doing.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.237
Thank you.
- Please.

03:14.281 --> 03:17.197
I talk for a living.
You guys do real work.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.328
And I plan to get
you paid for it.

03:18.372 --> 03:20.939
- Well, it's about time,

03:20.983 --> 03:23.333
'cause they've pushed us around
for too long.

03:23.377 --> 03:25.857
They just kept pushing
and pushing,

03:25.901 --> 03:28.033
and they're about to find out
what happens

03:28.077 --> 03:29.774
when I get to the edge.

03:31.820 --> 03:36.346
- I'm passionate, too.
It just manifests differently.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.696
- Zap and wear sweater.
- Mm.

03:38.740 --> 03:41.699
- "Microwavable for up to nine
minutes of piping-hot comfort."

03:41.743 --> 03:44.485
Oh.  Easy.
I'll sell the hell out of this.

03:44.528 --> 03:48.053
- Well, Glenn, I have found
your item right here.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.229
- Oh.

03:49.272 --> 03:50.708
- It's either a pig-shaped shoe

03:50.752 --> 03:52.493
or a shoe-shaped pig.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.756
It has a handle but no spout.

03:54.799 --> 03:58.063
This is a bad thing.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.891
- No problem.
- Well, Garrett,

03:59.935 --> 04:02.720
you'll be working with this
Tony Danza popcorn machine.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.896
- Oh, okay, well, at least mine
serves a purpose.

04:04.940 --> 04:10.119
This pops "Tony Danza brand
popcorn cartridges only.

04:10.162 --> 04:12.513
Cartridges not included."

04:15.124 --> 04:16.386
- Hey.

04:16.430 --> 04:17.909
How's Jonah doing out there?
Crushing it?

04:17.953 --> 04:20.303
God, you ever look at that guy
and get so proud,

04:20.347 --> 04:22.566
you have to look away?

04:22.610 --> 04:24.612
- Well, all I know so far
is that he's got parking.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.309
There's probably just
nothing else to report.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.616
I mean, in which case he could
have said, "Nothing to report,"

04:28.659 --> 04:29.921
but he didn't,
and that's fine.

04:29.965 --> 04:31.053
- Don't worry.

04:31.096 --> 04:32.489
If he texts me first,
I'll download you.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.665
- Amy, what's the scoop
on the poop?

04:34.709 --> 04:36.406
- Nothing yet.
- But we'll let you know.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.974
- I will let you know.
He's gonna text me first.

04:39.017 --> 04:40.845
- Cool, we'll just get
a text tree going.

04:40.889 --> 04:43.544
Jonah texts whichever one
of us--gut says me.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.285
- It's not gonna be you.
I've seen his favorites.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.112
You're not in there.
- What?

04:47.156 --> 04:48.723
- Nice, Amy.

04:48.766 --> 04:50.855
Guess who's gonna be cleaning
this up all afternoon.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.074
Come on, buddy.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.556
- I look at these chumps,

04:55.599 --> 04:58.298
I see breakfast,
lunch, dinner.

04:58.341 --> 05:01.388
- Is your chair
a little bit low?

05:01.431 --> 05:03.955
- Is it?
Hang on.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.611
- What are you--

05:07.655 --> 05:09.265
- I think it's--
- Just make it come back.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.919
- It won't do it. It's--
- Morning, folks!

05:10.962 --> 05:12.790
- So then you sit up.
- Sorry I'm late.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.705
Ah, some, uh--some pretty
big numbers

05:14.749 --> 05:16.925
in this proposal of yours.

05:16.968 --> 05:20.450
100% premium coverage?
- We think that's fair.

05:20.494 --> 05:21.451
- Correct.

05:21.495 --> 05:22.670
The workers have voted

05:22.713 --> 05:24.454
to make health care
priority one.

05:24.498 --> 05:26.456
Right--right, Sandra?
- Yep.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.806
- I mean, I applaud you
for trying,

05:28.850 --> 05:31.766
but we're not paying 100%
of premiums.

05:31.809 --> 05:35.160
- Okay, maybe a more
workable number is 70%.

05:35.204 --> 05:36.379
- Hmm.
- Yeah?

05:36.423 --> 05:39.861
- Uh, all the way down to 70%?
Just--

05:42.733 --> 05:44.866
- Yeah, I think
this one's broken.

05:47.085 --> 05:48.522
- So any word from Jonah?

05:48.565 --> 05:50.219
Good negoshe,
bad negoshe?

05:50.262 --> 05:51.481
- Nope, not yet.
Still early.

05:51.525 --> 05:52.656
- I'll bet they're blowing it.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.398
- Okay, I'm gonna go check
on that.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.794
Need any help
with whatever this is?

05:59.837 --> 06:01.535
- Okay, I know
what you're thinking.

06:01.578 --> 06:03.363
It looks great.
It just needs lights.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.147
- Ooh, Amy,
how's union stuff going?

06:05.190 --> 06:08.193
- I know what you know, Janet,
which is  nothing!

06:08.237 --> 06:11.675
But when there is news, I, uh--
well, I'll tell you first.

06:13.634 --> 06:16.071
- Whoa, you're, like,
rich-lady tense right now.

06:16.114 --> 06:18.073
- I know. I'm just trying not
to worry about it,

06:18.116 --> 06:19.814
but then people just keep
asking me about it,

06:19.857 --> 06:21.511
which is making me
worry about it, and...

06:21.555 --> 06:24.122
Actually,
I really need to get out.

06:24.166 --> 06:27.125
Um, how about I go buy us
a Christmas tree?

06:27.169 --> 06:28.779
Because this isn't one.

06:28.823 --> 06:30.041
- Great.
I'll warm up the truck.

06:30.085 --> 06:31.391
Cheyenne, let's go.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.044
- No, you guys don't have
to come with me.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.350
- Oh, we absolutely do.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.656
I mean, I love this girl,

06:35.699 --> 06:36.874
but she is just
the kind of sucker

06:36.918 --> 06:38.441
to pay through the nose
for a Douglas fir

06:38.485 --> 06:40.225
and then come back
with an eastern white pine.

06:41.575 --> 06:44.534
It's true, Amy.
You totally would.

06:44.578 --> 06:46.710
- Okay, fine, whatever.
Let's just go.

06:49.365 --> 06:51.106
- This tree farm has
a huge selection,

06:51.149 --> 06:52.368
so let's talk game plan.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.891
We're looking
for blue-green color,

06:53.935 --> 06:55.458
conical shape,
short needles.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.373
Don't be afraid to give it
a few kicks.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.115
That's legally well
within your right.

07:00.158 --> 07:02.378
- What about that one?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.728
- Oh, yeah.
That one's perfect.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.602
- What?
Wait, no, no.

07:08.645 --> 07:11.126
Guys, we can't just--
That's a tree!

07:11.169 --> 07:13.650
Like, a treetree!

07:13.694 --> 07:15.478
- And if you have any problems,

07:15.522 --> 07:18.307
my man Tony's email
is right here on the box.

07:18.350 --> 07:19.613
Check it out.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.702
-  Well...
- Sorry to intrude.

07:21.745 --> 07:25.357
But you have the exact same
physique as my friend Chris.

07:25.401 --> 07:27.621
Would you mind trying this on?
- Sure.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.623
No problem.
- Thank you.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.102
- I don't remember you
ever talking

07:31.146 --> 07:32.452
about a friend named Chris.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.802
- Oh, he just moved here.
He's an archaeologist.

07:34.845 --> 07:37.413
- Hmm, no.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.807
Thank you, but this
is all wrong for Chris.

07:39.850 --> 07:42.418
It makes you look
so muscular--oh.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.507
And he's trying to get less
attention from women...

07:44.551 --> 07:45.943
and occasionally men?

07:45.987 --> 07:47.510
- Muscular?
Really?

07:47.554 --> 07:49.512
- Yeah, you know, and if you
want to keep that body tight,

07:49.556 --> 07:52.167
nothing's better than
a healthy snack like popcorn.

07:52.210 --> 07:54.169
- I think he knows what
he's doing with his body.

07:54.212 --> 07:55.344
I mean, have you seen
the sweater?

07:55.387 --> 07:57.128
It's--why are you
taking that off?

07:57.172 --> 08:00.654
- Yeah, thanks.
I'm--I'm just browsing today.

08:00.697 --> 08:01.829
- Oh, come on.
- But--

08:01.872 --> 08:03.265
No, you have to buy one
of these!

08:03.308 --> 08:05.136
- Yeah, browsing's
for cowards, dude!

08:05.180 --> 08:08.400
- Our customers prefer
when cashiers stand.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.838
- At least give them
anti-fatigue mats.

08:10.881 --> 08:12.666
Or do your customers also

08:12.709 --> 08:14.145
prefer cashiers
with tendinitis?

08:14.189 --> 08:17.235
- Okay, uh, we can allow
for mats

08:17.279 --> 08:19.499
if the employees
supply their own.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.370
- We'll consider that.
Thank you.

08:21.413 --> 08:22.545
- Uh, I'm sorry.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.460
To be clear,
you want the workers

08:24.504 --> 08:26.593
to buy safety equipment
for your stores?

08:26.636 --> 08:30.205
What are we gonna throw
in next--carts, shelving?

08:30.248 --> 08:32.207
You know, maybe--maybe
we could pay your salaries.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.382
How much do you make?

08:33.425 --> 08:35.297
Maybe I could go
get my checkbook.

08:37.255 --> 08:40.998
- You know,
I saw some bagels out there.

08:41.042 --> 08:44.872
Let's take a five?
- Yeah.

08:44.915 --> 08:47.135
- We cannot just
chop down a tree.

08:47.178 --> 08:49.180
We're not the paper towel guy.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.400
- Come on, Amy,
it's Christmas.

08:51.443 --> 08:53.141
Plus, this will be
the first legal thing

08:53.184 --> 08:54.403
I've ever done in the woods.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.100
- No, guys.
What if one of us gets hurt?

08:56.144 --> 08:57.537
I have enough
to worry about today.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.843
Dina.
- Cheyenne, give her the axe.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.236
Now, just as an experiment,

09:01.279 --> 09:02.324
take one whack,
all right?

09:02.367 --> 09:03.847
You don't have to go
full fell.

09:03.891 --> 09:06.894
If you don't like it,
tree farm it is.

09:06.937 --> 09:10.593
- Fine.
One swing for Dina.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.291
- And you're not gonna want
to hit it straight on, okay?

09:13.335 --> 09:15.467
Angle it down like you're
dealing cards to a baby.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.385
- Ooh.

09:21.430 --> 09:24.955
- I mean,
I guess I see the appeal.

09:24.999 --> 09:28.219
Eat my axe!
- Gross, Amy.

09:28.263 --> 09:29.960
- "Axe," Cheyenne.
"Axe."

09:30.004 --> 09:32.572
- Oh, that's a weird thing
to say.

09:32.615 --> 09:33.964
Who wants to eat an axe?

09:34.008 --> 09:35.270
- Timber!

09:35.313 --> 09:36.576
- No, you don't
say that until--

09:36.619 --> 09:37.794
- Timber!

09:37.838 --> 09:39.230
- No, no, you wait and say it
when it falls.

09:39.274 --> 09:40.754
both:
Timber!

09:40.797 --> 09:42.059
- Paul Bunyan can suck it.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.150
- Oh, um, Amy,
I'm so sorry,

09:46.194 --> 09:48.544
but could you just step back,
like, a teensy bit?

09:50.677 --> 09:52.635
- Oh, she's crowning!

09:57.031 --> 09:59.468
Finish her, Sosa.

10:02.558 --> 10:04.473
- Let's do this!

10:06.083 --> 10:09.173
- Timber!

10:11.523 --> 10:13.134
We did it!
- Chopped, fool!

10:13.177 --> 10:14.831
- We chopped you, tree!
- Yeah, fool!

10:16.137 --> 10:19.488
Okay, so, um,
to get it inside...

10:19.531 --> 10:22.665
- Yeah, it's a solid question.
- I have no idea.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.319
- Excuse me, ma'am.

10:24.362 --> 10:26.800
Are you looking for a fancy way

10:26.843 --> 10:28.802
to display
your pig-based sauces?

10:28.845 --> 10:31.021
Well, no look no further.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.588
Nope, you hate it.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.503
Okay, I can see that.
Sorry to waste your time.

10:34.546 --> 10:36.592
- Hey, don't apologize.
I get it.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.334
I work in sales myself.
- No kidding.

10:39.377 --> 10:41.249
- Well, beachfront timeshares
in Fort Lauderdale

10:41.292 --> 10:43.468
pretty much sell themselves,
you know?

10:43.512 --> 10:46.341
Hot tub, wraparound balcony,
great views.

10:46.384 --> 10:48.604
It's the perfect
vacation getaway.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.824
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.826
- It must be
pretty pricey, though.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.828
- You would think,
but it actually turns out to be

10:54.871 --> 10:56.090
much cheaper than a hotel.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.352
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

10:57.395 --> 11:00.007
- Okay, I-I don't want
to put you out,

11:00.050 --> 11:02.531
but if I gave you my email,

11:02.574 --> 11:05.839
is there any way that
I could get more information?

11:05.882 --> 11:08.755
- We've come too far to give up
this much, this soon.

11:08.798 --> 11:11.366
- You want to go in there and
demand everything--I get it.

11:11.409 --> 11:14.064
I've done it, and I've lost.

11:14.108 --> 11:15.196
Now, we all want to win
in there, right?

11:15.239 --> 11:16.414
- Yes, of course.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.025
- Then I suggest we--
Ah.

11:18.068 --> 11:19.722
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no, are you okay?

11:19.766 --> 11:20.897
- I'm good.
I'm good.

11:20.941 --> 11:22.856
- Here.

11:22.899 --> 11:25.336
- Oh. Oh.
- That's, um--ooh.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.555
A lot of blood, though.
- That's--that is--

11:26.598 --> 11:28.078
- No, I'll be--I'm--I'm--
I'll be fine.

11:28.122 --> 11:30.254
- Are--are you sure?

11:30.298 --> 11:32.213
- Okay, no.

11:32.256 --> 11:33.867
This is
an emergency-room situation.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.390
- Yeah.

11:35.433 --> 11:38.785
- I chopped a tree!
Now I'm driving a forklift!

11:40.090 --> 11:41.526
- Now, you're all clear
on this end.

11:41.570 --> 11:43.093
- Okay, yeah, you're looking
good on the trunk side.

11:43.137 --> 11:44.312
- Oh, crap!

11:44.355 --> 11:45.879
That might be Jonah.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.750
Hold on, give me a second.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.447
Yes.
Yes, it's him.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.449
"Georgia had bagel accident"?

11:51.493 --> 11:53.060
What the hell does that mean?

11:53.103 --> 11:54.539
- Ah, he probably used
voice-to-text.

11:54.583 --> 11:57.412
I bet he meant, "George
had a baked quail egg salad."

11:57.455 --> 11:59.153
Oh, this George sounds like
a bit of an oddball.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.415
- You know what?
I'm just--

12:00.458 --> 12:02.025
I'm gonna call him real quick.

12:03.723 --> 12:04.767
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.203
You answered.

12:06.247 --> 12:07.378
How are things going
over there?

12:07.422 --> 12:09.337
- Well, uh,
Georgia cut herself.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.382
She's out of commission
for the rest of the day,

12:11.426 --> 12:13.820
and Corporate won't set
another meeting until March.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.212
- No!
No, no, no!

12:15.256 --> 12:16.953
Get back in there.
- What are you talking about?

12:16.997 --> 12:18.607
We can't negotiate
without Georgia.

12:18.650 --> 12:20.435
- Yes, you can!
I mean, I don't know.

12:20.478 --> 12:21.784
Maybe this is just
the adrenaline talking--

12:21.828 --> 12:23.351
I chopped down a tree,
by the way.

12:23.394 --> 12:24.961
- What? Why?
- Because I wanted to.

12:25.005 --> 12:26.093
Well, I didn't want to
at first,

12:26.136 --> 12:27.224
but then Dina made me want to,

12:27.268 --> 12:28.573
and then Cheyenne
gave me an axe and--

12:28.617 --> 12:30.401
- Okay, I'll want
to know more about that.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.403
- Look, Jonah,
you know what we want.

12:32.447 --> 12:33.883
Just see what you can get.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.798
It--it'll be better than them
pushing this till March,

12:35.842 --> 12:37.452
and then they're gonna
make it July,

12:37.495 --> 12:39.280
and then it's gonna be October.
- Yeah, yeah.

12:39.323 --> 12:40.455
No, you're right.
You're right.

12:40.498 --> 12:41.891
We can do this.
- Yes!

12:41.935 --> 12:43.110
Yes, you can!

12:43.153 --> 12:44.633
You are smart!
You got this!

12:44.676 --> 12:47.114
- I love you. Thank you.
Got to go, bye.

12:47.157 --> 12:49.899
- Oh, Amy!
The tree!

12:49.943 --> 12:52.032
- Oh!

12:53.598 --> 12:55.470
- And if you follow the news,

12:55.513 --> 12:57.167
you know that
microwavable sweaters

12:57.211 --> 12:59.256
are the leading cause
of nipple cancer.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.215
It's true. It's a fact.
- Really? It's just--

13:04.566 --> 13:07.221
Huh.

13:14.010 --> 13:15.490
- So sorry, sir.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.144
There's a Target
five minutes away.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.623
Honestly, it's nicer.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.756
All right, well, um,
we have a power outage.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.453
- Lack of electricity.

13:22.497 --> 13:24.107
Technically,
it's still in here

13:24.151 --> 13:25.369
in the walls,

13:25.413 --> 13:27.807
but we can't get it out
via the wires.

13:27.850 --> 13:31.027
- Right, so, evidentially,
a tree fell

13:31.071 --> 13:33.813
and hit a transformer box,
weirdly.

13:33.856 --> 13:36.511
- That is literally
all we know.

13:36.554 --> 13:37.991
- What if Corporate did this

13:38.034 --> 13:40.167
to intimidate us
in negotiations?

13:40.210 --> 13:44.519
- Yeah, they're saying
we're powerless as a union.

13:44.562 --> 13:48.740
- Or they're saying we have
no heat as a union.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.700
Never mind.
Sayid's was better.

13:51.743 --> 13:54.094
- Jonah probably said
something to upset them.

13:54.137 --> 13:56.183
I don't know why you let him
tag along with Sandra.

13:56.226 --> 13:57.575
- What?
No.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.447
Jonah didn't say anything.
He's--he's doing fine.

13:59.490 --> 14:00.709
I just spoke to him.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.232
all: What?
- What did they say?

14:02.276 --> 14:03.886
- It's going great.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.975
Yes, the union negotiator had
to step out for the afternoon,

14:06.019 --> 14:07.890
but Jonah and Sandra
have got it covered.

14:07.934 --> 14:11.546
- So it's just
the two of them...

14:11.589 --> 14:14.723
in there by themselves
with no grown-up.

14:14.766 --> 14:17.073
- A 75-cent wage increase?

14:17.117 --> 14:19.902
We're asking for $3.
- You're floor workers.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.730
It's not your fault that you
don't get the ins and outs

14:21.773 --> 14:22.992
of the budget.

14:23.036 --> 14:26.735
- We may be floor workers,
but we're not morons.

14:26.778 --> 14:29.216
I-I actually went
to business school.

14:29.259 --> 14:31.653
- And I'm engaged
to be married.

14:33.307 --> 14:34.743
- Exciting.

14:34.786 --> 14:37.789
Look, if your negotiator
were here,

14:37.833 --> 14:39.313
she'd tell you that this
is the best deal

14:39.356 --> 14:41.228
you're gonna get.
- You're right, she's not.

14:41.271 --> 14:43.099
But that doesn't mean that
you get to just sprinkle

14:43.143 --> 14:45.275
a few crumbs
and expect a thank-you.

14:45.319 --> 14:48.017
We're--we're not here
for the crumbs, you know?

14:48.061 --> 14:50.759
W-w-we're here for the whole,
you know, cookie.

14:50.802 --> 14:52.848
The--or the--the pie.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.763
The whole baked good.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.504
- Okay, just relax.

14:56.547 --> 14:57.722
- We don't get to relax!

14:57.766 --> 14:59.637
That's kind of the point.

14:59.681 --> 15:03.685
No, we go to work mopping up
scum in your stores

15:03.728 --> 15:06.906
and--and ruining our knees
lifting boxes,

15:06.949 --> 15:11.084
and after all of that,
we still can't afford rent

15:11.127 --> 15:14.130
or--or to go to a doctor
when we're sick

15:14.174 --> 15:16.089
or to--to buy a car

15:16.132 --> 15:18.004
instead of taking
five different buses to work.

15:18.047 --> 15:20.267
- Five buses?
Really?

15:20.310 --> 15:22.704
- The 34 to the 66

15:22.747 --> 15:26.577
to the 94 to the 70
to the 58X.

15:28.144 --> 15:30.755
Look, guys,
we want to work with you.

15:30.799 --> 15:33.758
It's just that this stuff
is kind of complicated.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.630
- We'll make it simple for you.

15:35.673 --> 15:38.763
Do better,
or we go on strike.

15:46.206 --> 15:49.165
- We're gonna take
a sidebar.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.995
- Oh, you're--
you're all gonna go.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.737
Huh.
Okay.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.828
- Are you shopping?

15:59.871 --> 16:02.526
I thought all
the customers had left.

16:02.570 --> 16:03.788
- Well, I really need
ice cream cones.

16:03.832 --> 16:05.442
- You stay right here.

16:05.486 --> 16:08.184
You're not getting out of this
store without a pig shoe.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.318
- Hey, someone's still here.

16:11.361 --> 16:12.536
Do you like popcorn

16:12.580 --> 16:14.103
but wish the process
was more complicated?

16:14.147 --> 16:15.104
- There he is!

16:15.148 --> 16:16.845
The man born to wear
this sweater.

16:16.888 --> 16:18.281
- I really just need
ice cream cones.

16:18.325 --> 16:20.022
- Hello, again.
-  Leave me alone!

16:20.066 --> 16:21.763
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

16:24.157 --> 16:26.420
- I hope Jonah knows not
to take the first offer,

16:26.463 --> 16:29.292
because a lot of the time,
that's actually the worst one.

16:29.336 --> 16:32.165
- If I were Corporate,
I'd just say no to everything.

16:32.208 --> 16:35.037
Who are you, a couple of chumps
from the town dump?

16:35.081 --> 16:37.170
- Okay, guys, we need to stop
talking about this

16:37.213 --> 16:39.041
and get back to work.
- Oh, I know!

16:39.085 --> 16:41.391
We could all help bring in
the Christmas tree.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.350
- What Christmas tree?

16:43.393 --> 16:46.396
- Do you mean the tree
that fell on the transformer?

16:46.440 --> 16:47.832
Is it a Christmas tree?

16:47.876 --> 16:49.269
That's such a fun guess,
Cheyenne.

16:49.312 --> 16:51.793
I would've guessed maple,
but that's just me.

16:51.836 --> 16:53.447
Someone should be writing
these down

16:53.490 --> 16:55.753
just to see who gets closest.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.886
No one left to sell to.

16:57.929 --> 17:00.584
- Yeah, I guess
we should call it a draw.

17:00.628 --> 17:03.283
- Yeah, it's too bad.

17:03.326 --> 17:05.459
- I bet someone
would've really loved this.

17:05.502 --> 17:08.027
I mean,
it's so warm and soft.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.247
- Ooh, like a bird belly.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.380
- Also, is it getting chilly
in here?

17:13.423 --> 17:15.295
- Glenn, you know
what he's doing, right?

17:15.338 --> 17:17.166
- Yeah, I know.
We're just talking.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.560
- It might be nice
to warm it up like cocoa

17:19.603 --> 17:21.736
and just snuggle in.

17:21.779 --> 17:23.216
- Oh, that does sound nice.

17:23.259 --> 17:24.913
- Glenn, look at me.

17:24.956 --> 17:26.697
You gave Mateo that sweater
because it's terrible.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.090
- Yeah.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.657
- Besides, the microwave
doesn't even work

17:29.700 --> 17:31.006
during a blackout.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.486
- Yeah.
- It's a great color.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.924
It's medium.
- Medium?

17:35.967 --> 17:39.275
That used to be my size.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.364
- I blew it, didn't I?

17:41.408 --> 17:43.453
I did. I did.
I blew it.

17:43.497 --> 17:46.239
- No!
You, um...

17:46.282 --> 17:48.763
Hey, you think they shellac
this table in house?

17:48.806 --> 17:50.417
- The team talked things over.

17:50.460 --> 17:51.940
- If I could just say--
- No need.

17:51.983 --> 17:54.247
We've decided to accept
your proposals in full.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.988
Expect a memo of understanding
from Legal soon.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.821
- Does that mean...
- I, uh...

18:03.865 --> 18:06.302
I think so.

18:06.346 --> 18:08.043
- Are these axe marks?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.001
Someone definitely cut
this thing down.

18:10.045 --> 18:12.003
- You know, actually I heard
that teens are going around

18:12.047 --> 18:13.570
chopping down trees these days.

18:13.614 --> 18:15.006
It's called lumberjacking.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.573
I saw it on "20/20."

18:16.617 --> 18:18.575
It's weird, but it's true.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.231
Oh, my God.

18:22.275 --> 18:24.886
They did it.
They made a deal.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.670
- They did it?
- Dang!

18:26.714 --> 18:29.064
- Yep, he text me, too.
Got it a couple of minutes ago.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.197
Didn't want to make you
feel bad.

18:41.337 --> 18:43.078
- Ice cream cocktail?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.993
Everything frozen
in Grocery is melting.

18:45.036 --> 18:47.169
- Sure, thanks.

18:47.213 --> 18:48.692
Aren't you lactose intolerant?

18:48.736 --> 18:50.303
- Yeah, it's gonna be bad.

18:50.346 --> 18:53.262
I told Bo to sleep at
his mom's house tonight.

18:53.306 --> 18:56.047
- I didn't know that
eight people could sidebar,

18:56.091 --> 18:57.701
but they all went.

18:57.745 --> 19:00.965
I mean, at some point, Sandra
and I are the sidebar, right?

19:01.009 --> 19:03.620
- Yeah, I mean, sidebar is two,
three people max--

19:03.664 --> 19:05.144
at least on "The Good Wife."

19:05.187 --> 19:07.798
- Wait, are we having one
right now?

19:07.842 --> 19:09.365
Is this my first sidebar?

19:09.409 --> 19:10.932
- We're having one.
- Oh, my God.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.151
It's so exciting.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.849
Honestly, I am still
a little in shock.

19:14.892 --> 19:16.285
You must be, too.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.244
You were convinced I was gonna
blow it this morning.

19:18.287 --> 19:19.767
- No, I wasn't!
- Yeah.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.116
"Call me when you lose.
Okay, bye!"

19:21.160 --> 19:22.813
- Okay,
that is not what I said!

19:22.857 --> 19:25.033
I maybe thought it just
a little bit

19:25.076 --> 19:26.469
because we always lose,

19:26.513 --> 19:30.212
because Corporate sucks
and everybody always sucks.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.823
Well, almost everybody--
not you.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.216
You did it.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.957
- Come on.
We did it.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.177
- Oh.
- Sandra and me.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.229
Ooh, it's Maya.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.405
- Uh-oh.
- I should call her back.

19:49.449 --> 19:50.841
How does this sound?

19:50.885 --> 19:52.974
Ugh, what a bummer
about the union.

19:53.017 --> 19:54.584
I don't know.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.630
It still kind of sounds like
you're a little happy about it.

19:56.673 --> 19:57.892
- I'll work on it.

19:59.285 --> 20:00.764
- I'm assuming you heard.

20:00.808 --> 20:03.419
- Yeah, I did, unfortunately.

20:03.463 --> 20:06.292
I mean, I guess the union was
a lot stronger than we thought.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.424
- Well, actually,
that's why I was calling.

20:08.468 --> 20:11.514
Cloud 9 just got bought out.
- What?

20:11.558 --> 20:14.082
- Yeah, we were acquired by
this big tech company--Zephra.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.518
I guess it's been
in the works,

20:15.562 --> 20:17.085
and they finalized it
this afternoon.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.043
- This--this afternoon?

20:19.087 --> 20:20.697
- During
the negotiations, yeah.

20:20.741 --> 20:22.046
Crazy.

20:22.090 --> 20:23.483
And the good news is
the new company

20:23.526 --> 20:25.659
doesn't have to recognize
the union contracts,

20:25.702 --> 20:28.749
so our people were just like,
"Go ahead, agree to whatever,"

20:28.792 --> 20:30.272
just to end the meeting.

20:30.316 --> 20:34.494
- So everything our employees
thought they won...

20:34.537 --> 20:36.322
- Gone.

20:37.714 --> 20:39.412
- Right.

20:39.455 --> 20:42.066
So, uh, what does this mean
for the company?

20:42.110 --> 20:43.764
- Big picture?
Who knows?

20:43.807 --> 20:45.418
They tell me nothing,

20:45.461 --> 20:48.464
but for now, I just wanted to
let you know, no more union.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.553
Hey, I've got to go make
a bunch more calls, okay?

20:50.597 --> 20:53.295
I'm sorry. Bye-bye.

20:55.471 --> 20:57.038
- Oh, oh, there you are.

20:57.081 --> 20:58.735
Dina busted out
the cart-jousting stuff.

20:58.779 --> 21:00.259
Come watch.
I made the finals.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.304
- Yeah, actually, I--
- Hold on, hold on!

21:02.348 --> 21:03.958
Here, I don't want to break it.

21:04.001 --> 21:06.134
I-I want to keep it
as a memento.

21:06.177 --> 21:08.919
I know it's dumb, but...

21:08.963 --> 21:11.270
I don't know.
Today was a good day.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.055
- It was.
It was a great day.

21:14.098 --> 21:15.186
- Let's go!
Pick your carts!

21:15.230 --> 21:16.797
- No, no, no, no, no!
I got first!

21:16.840 --> 21:19.190
- Now, I want a clean fight.
No head, neck, or groin.
