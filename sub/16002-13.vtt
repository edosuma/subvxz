[Deena] Previously
on What About Brian:

00:02.041 --> 00:05.375
- Talk to me.
- Carrie's deaf.
She lost her hearing.

00:05.375 --> 00:08.834
- I would do the surgery.
- Then that's what we should do.

00:08.834 --> 00:12.542
All you need to know
about my life is that
you're not a part of it.

00:12.542 --> 00:15.667
It's a summons.
He's suing you?!

00:15.667 --> 00:17.709
Heather and I,
we had an arrangement.

00:17.709 --> 00:20.166
You don't know your wife
as well as you thought.

00:20.166 --> 00:25.000
I was thinking... maybe
you'd want to move in, with me.

00:28.667 --> 00:30.875
- [Bridget] Who ate my Kashi?
- [Dave] Brian.

00:30.875 --> 00:32.375
I don't eat Kashi.

00:32.375 --> 00:34.542
Doesn't matter.
There's no milk.

00:34.542 --> 00:37.709
- Bridget's fault.
- I don't get milk.
I don't even live here.

00:37.709 --> 00:40.625
- I'm just staying here.
- I'm just spending the night.

00:40.625 --> 00:44.417
- I thought you were moving in.
- No, Brian's moving
into my place.

00:44.417 --> 00:45.583
[inaudible] No way.

00:45.583 --> 00:48.417
This is Brian's place.
He should buy the milk.

00:48.417 --> 00:51.709
- Who wants the sports page?
- [both] I do.

00:51.709 --> 00:54.709
Speaking of papers, your dad
gave me stuff to give you.

00:54.709 --> 00:57.834
- Some, uh,
papers for you to sign.
- What papers?

00:57.834 --> 01:01.917
- Selling his house in Big Bear.
- He can't do that.
Why's he doing that?

01:01.917 --> 01:04.000
Already done. Buyers
are moving in in two weeks.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.125
- Oh, man.
- That's terrible.

01:06.125 --> 01:07.750
We didn't get
to say good-bye.

01:07.750 --> 01:10.458
No. Remember when
we'd go up there?

01:10.458 --> 01:13.875
Friday night, pack up all
our stuff, spend the weekend?

01:13.875 --> 01:16.500
You know, we should
go up there. This weekend.

01:16.500 --> 01:19.250
- Who's we?
- You're right. Everybody.

01:19.250 --> 01:21.709
Adam, Nic, Jimmy, Ivy.
The whole gang.

01:21.709 --> 01:23.375
- Deena too?
- Yeah, Deena too.

01:23.375 --> 01:26.834
I'll stop by the house on my way
to work. That's a great idea.

01:27.625 --> 01:29.875
Oh, work. We should go.

01:29.875 --> 01:34.417
So you and me and all
of your friends are gonna get
together for the weekend?

01:34.417 --> 01:36.917
It'll be practice
for when we move in together.

01:36.917 --> 01:40.333
- Your friends
are moving into my place?
- You're moving into mine.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.959
- I don't think so.
- Whatever.

01:42.959 --> 01:45.125
[doorbell chimes]

01:45.125 --> 01:47.500
- [cell phone rings]
- Somebody get the door.

01:47.500 --> 01:50.166
- [Larissa] I want to!
- [Geneva] You got it last time!

01:50.166 --> 01:54.583
- Hello.
Yeah, this is Deena Greco.
- [girls] Daddy! Daddy!

01:54.583 --> 01:57.834
- When do we have to decide by?
- What are you doing here?

01:57.834 --> 02:01.750
- I'm gonna take you
to the mountains.
- [girls cheering]

02:01.750 --> 02:04.083
Mommy's on the phone.
We got to be quiet.

02:04.083 --> 02:07.500
I guess we will call you
first thing Monday morning then.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.458
No, thank you. Bye.

02:09.458 --> 02:13.041
- Who's that?
- It was the surgeon's office.

02:13.041 --> 02:17.041
They had a cancellation
and they can do Carrie's
surgery next Friday.

02:17.041 --> 02:19.083
So... does it...

02:19.083 --> 02:23.000
- Daddy's taking us
to the mountains!
- [Deena] Wow.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.834
Yeah, I was thinking
of taking you guys up
to Brian's dad's place,

02:26.834 --> 02:30.166
- but we probably should...
- Maybe another weekend, girls.

02:30.166 --> 02:33.375
- [both groan]
- We said we were
gonna take them there.

02:33.375 --> 02:36.333
This will be great for us.
We'll get out of town.

02:36.333 --> 02:39.750
The whole gang's going.
Maybe get a little perspective.

02:39.750 --> 02:43.166
We'll go up the mountain,
make a decision,
come down like Moses.

02:43.166 --> 02:46.583
- Please, Mommy.
- Come on. Please, Mommy.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.875
- Oh, OK! OK! OK.
- [all cheering]

02:51.291 --> 02:53.208
Are these boots OK
for the mountains?

02:54.250 --> 02:56.041
Don't you have
any hiking boots?

02:56.041 --> 02:58.083
I don't really do nature.

02:58.083 --> 03:00.333
- You can use Nic's.
- Isn't she coming?

03:00.333 --> 03:03.625
Bella's too little and all those
people. Especially the kids.

03:03.625 --> 03:05.625
Kids are walking germ factories.

03:05.625 --> 03:09.375
If she's not going, I'm not.
She's the only one
that likes me.

03:09.375 --> 03:13.542
- Dave likes you.
Jimmy likes you.
- Women. Women don't like me.

03:13.542 --> 03:16.291
- That's ridiculous.
- No, I'm serious.

03:16.291 --> 03:19.709
I grew up with three brothers.
I don't know how
to talk to women.

03:19.709 --> 03:21.875
"He's so cute."
"I like your earrings."

03:21.875 --> 03:25.291
- I'm not good at that.
- These girls like you.

03:25.291 --> 03:29.250
Or at least they will
after this weekend.
I'll make sure of it.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.500
I have something for you.

03:38.667 --> 03:40.750
A key to my place.

03:42.583 --> 03:46.834
[laughs] Oh... OK, thanks.

03:47.959 --> 03:50.166
Brian, why can't
we figure this out?

03:50.166 --> 03:52.917
Whose place
we're moving into.

03:55.166 --> 03:56.750
You know why.

03:56.750 --> 04:00.583
I think I do, but I want
to hear what you think.

04:00.583 --> 04:03.417
Neither one of us
wants to give up our place.

04:03.417 --> 04:06.500
Give up the security of it.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.917
You know, because
what if it doesn't work out?

04:10.542 --> 04:12.917
What if we break up...

04:12.917 --> 04:17.625
...and then we gave up
our home for... nothing.

04:17.625 --> 04:22.125
Well, when you put it like that,
it's a wonder anyone
ever gets together.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.709
I can't go with you
to the mountains this weekend.

04:26.709 --> 04:29.458
- Why not? You got to come.
- I'm working.

04:29.458 --> 04:32.417
- You can study up there.
- Not studying.

04:32.417 --> 04:34.625
I'm picking up
extra shifts at the club.

04:34.625 --> 04:37.875
Five or six Saturdays until I
make enough to pay Schmitty.

04:37.875 --> 04:40.125
And he'll drop the suit.

04:43.542 --> 04:45.458
Do you actually think
I'd be OK with this?

04:45.458 --> 04:51.083
- No. I knew you wouldn't, but..
- I'll pay Schmitty the money.

04:51.083 --> 04:56.333
Heather, don't miss out on this
weekend because of him. Please?

04:56.333 --> 04:59.417
We used to go up all the time.
All the friends together.

04:59.417 --> 05:02.458
- Marjorie too?
- Yeah, she used to go up.

05:02.458 --> 05:05.792
- Is she gonna be there?
- No. No, of course not.

05:05.792 --> 05:08.667
And even if she were,
I'd still want you to go.

05:08.667 --> 05:12.000
Adam, I can't make it
through a birthday party.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.291
I'm not ready to go
on vacation with her.

05:15.291 --> 05:17.667
Yeah. OK. Well, don't come.

05:20.333 --> 05:24.333
You know, maybe it's better
if we have some time apart.

05:27.125 --> 05:29.625
- Adam...
- I have to pack.

I wish we were by ourselves.
We could do it in every room.

06:47.959 --> 06:50.959
- We can still do that.
- We're not
gonna be that couple.

06:50.959 --> 06:53.041
- What couple?
- The sex couple.

06:53.041 --> 06:55.959
The ones sneaking off to do it
or talking about it

06:55.959 --> 06:58.458
or doing it so loudly
everyone can hear.

06:58.458 --> 07:00.458
The grabber takes
the best room.

07:00.458 --> 07:03.125
The camp counselor
overschedules everything.

07:03.125 --> 07:07.750

competitive and the girlfriend
who ends up in tears.

Come on. I'm sure we
can knock off a few rooms
before anyone gets here.

07:12.583 --> 07:17.083
Mmm. [giggles] Wow!

07:17.083 --> 07:18.166
Does Adam know?

07:19.417 --> 07:21.291
About this meeting
we're having?

07:21.291 --> 07:23.917
No. He's out of town
at Brian's cabin.

07:23.917 --> 07:26.250
It's his dad's.
I love that place.

07:26.250 --> 07:29.041
What is your
intention exactly
towards my husband?

07:29.041 --> 07:30.625
I don't have any intention.

07:30.625 --> 07:32.959
Because Adam and I are married.
We're happy.

07:32.959 --> 07:35.500
If you came back to
get back together with him...

07:35.500 --> 07:39.667
I did not come back here for
Adam. I came back for myself.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.750
- You don't have
feelings for him?
- Of course I do.

07:43.667 --> 07:46.041
We have a history.

07:46.041 --> 07:49.166
I was with Adam for two years.
You've known him for a month.

07:49.166 --> 07:51.834
But I never hurt him.

07:51.834 --> 07:54.166
You screwed him. I'm not
gonna let it happen again.

07:54.166 --> 07:55.834
I'm not doing anything.

07:55.834 --> 07:59.917
It is what it is.
If Adam has feelings for me,
you can't change that.

07:59.917 --> 08:01.792
- You can't control him.
- I'm his wife.

08:01.792 --> 08:03.458
Any more than I can.

08:06.750 --> 08:11.250
- Oh, look at the lake!
- [giggles]

08:11.250 --> 08:13.458
Uh, girls?
Please don't jump on the couch.

08:13.458 --> 08:15.834
Come on, Larissa.
Let's go look upstairs.

08:15.834 --> 08:18.583
- [Adam] Hey, everybody!
- Hey, what's up, buddy?

08:18.583 --> 08:22.041
- Where's Heather?
- She couldn't make it, honey.

08:22.041 --> 08:25.125
How will he know you'd be ready
to do the surgery in a week?

08:25.125 --> 08:29.291
Doesn't he have to get to know
her and do tests on her and...

08:29.291 --> 08:32.542
OK. Well, would you please call
me after you talk to him?

08:32.542 --> 08:35.125
- Thanks, honey. Bye.
- [phone beeps off]

08:35.125 --> 08:36.959
Who was that?

08:36.959 --> 08:41.083
Um, actually, it was...
it was Marjorie.

08:43.208 --> 08:47.000
Mmm. How are you holding up?
You know, with Carrie?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.875
I'm OK. Thanks.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.875
Talking to Marjorie
really calms me down.

08:52.875 --> 08:56.041
She's just so clear and smart.

08:56.041 --> 08:58.875
Well, it is nice having
a doctor around, you know?

08:58.875 --> 09:03.709
One time I thought I had
appendicitis and it turned out
to be really bad gas.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.500
It was like
this shooting pain.

09:05.500 --> 09:08.583
Another time I had
this burning sensation...

09:08.583 --> 09:12.667
OK, yeah. Speaking of that...
did you bring the sausage?

09:12.667 --> 09:15.917
[Dave] Listen up. First activity
of the day is gonna be fishing.

09:15.917 --> 09:17.500
- [guys] Yeah!
- Yeah!

09:17.500 --> 09:20.750
The van leaves in 30 minutes,
and novices are welcome.

09:20.750 --> 09:25.083
- What's a novice?
- A novice is someone who's
never gone fishing before.

09:25.083 --> 09:27.583
- Wanna go fishing
with your dad?
- I'm scared.

09:27.583 --> 09:31.041
- Why?
- I don't wanna turn out
like Mr. Jeremy Fisher.

09:31.041 --> 09:33.417
Who's Jeremy Fisher?

09:33.417 --> 09:37.000
He's this salamander who
almost gets eaten by a trout.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.500
- My people!
- [all] Hey!

09:39.500 --> 09:41.417
- Where you guys been?
- You're late.

09:41.417 --> 09:44.709
- We got pulled over.
- You're kidding me?
For speeding?

09:44.709 --> 09:47.208
Not really.
It was more like for weaving.

09:47.208 --> 09:49.542
No, it was more
of a bob than a weave.

09:49.542 --> 09:52.125
Jimmy getting
something-something on the 215?

09:52.125 --> 09:55.291
- What's a something-something?
- It's nothing-nothing.

09:55.291 --> 09:57.458
Sex couple.

10:00.709 --> 10:03.458
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:04.291 --> 10:06.959
Wow...

10:06.959 --> 10:09.291
...there's a lot
of memories in this house.

10:09.291 --> 10:10.875
Yeah.

10:10.875 --> 10:14.291
Did you ask me to marry you
on the deck or down by the lake?

10:14.291 --> 10:17.875
[laughs] Oh, I think it
was down by the lake.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.458
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:19.458 --> 10:22.625
You remember I was
going back and forth

10:22.625 --> 10:25.333
whether or not I
should ask you up here.

10:25.333 --> 10:29.250
And right before we left,
I pulled you down there,
asked you.

10:29.250 --> 10:32.750
Everybody was waiting
in their cars,
knowing what I was doing.

10:35.250 --> 10:39.417
So is that what you're
doing now, about the surgery?

10:39.417 --> 10:42.166
Just kind of
going back and forth?

10:42.166 --> 10:45.125
- Yeah, sort of.
- Well, let's talk about it.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.417
Kind of going fishing.

10:47.417 --> 10:49.667
Dave, we came up here
to discuss this.

10:49.667 --> 10:52.917
It's Saturday. We have
till Monday. I need
some time to think.

10:52.917 --> 10:54.750
You have had
24 hours to think.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.291
Why are you rushing me?

10:56.291 --> 10:58.667
You push and push.
You're always rushing me.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.333
Why put it off, you know?

11:00.333 --> 11:03.667
I'm not. This is my process.
This is what I do.

11:03.667 --> 11:06.291
Your process
doesn't mesh with my process.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.458
Really, Deen?

11:07.458 --> 11:08.875
- Yeah.
- You think?

11:08.875 --> 11:11.542
I didn't come to make
sandwiches, sit on the beach.

11:11.542 --> 11:14.291
I came here to make a decision.
And I wanna make it now.

11:14.291 --> 11:17.000

23:04.375 --> 23:06.041
I think it's time for a break.

23:06.041 --> 23:08.667
Pee break. Checking on
kids break. Drinks break.

23:08.667 --> 23:10.375
- Want to come with me?
- OK.

23:10.375 --> 23:13.542
- [Dave] What do you need,
buddy?
- [Marjorie] Wait, wait, wait.

23:13.542 --> 23:16.291
- I'll go get you a drink,
all right?
- Yeah.

23:26.417 --> 23:27.875
- [whispers] Hey.
- Hey.

23:27.875 --> 23:30.417
- They sleeping?
- Yeah, like babies.

23:30.417 --> 23:33.750
I don't know how with Bridget
screeching, "Mansfield Park!"

23:33.750 --> 23:36.208
Oh, what's up with that?

23:36.208 --> 23:38.583
- We're killing.
- Yeah. Well,

23:38.583 --> 23:40.583
- we definitely still got it.
- Yeah.

23:40.583 --> 23:42.291
We totally got it.

23:42.291 --> 23:44.834
I watched you
with the girls today.

23:46.667 --> 23:51.333
You're so good with them.
Teaching them how to fish.

23:52.667 --> 23:55.291
[sighs] Geneva's just like you.

23:55.291 --> 23:56.792
What do you mean?

23:56.792 --> 24:00.500
You know, the whole
process thing, you know?

24:00.500 --> 24:03.834
She sort of waits and watches.

24:03.834 --> 24:05.625
Like hovers, you know?

24:05.625 --> 24:08.333
Worries about it and then,

24:08.333 --> 24:10.667
if you don't push her,
she gets around to it,

24:10.667 --> 24:14.083
- in her own time.
- She does.

24:14.083 --> 24:18.500
And I see those two beauties
together, Geneva and Larissa,

24:18.500 --> 24:22.333
how close they are. Man.

24:24.041 --> 24:26.333
I just don't want
Carrie to miss out on that.

24:26.333 --> 24:31.709
Because, you know, her dad
couldn't make a tough call.

24:35.500 --> 24:36.917
Let's do it.

24:36.917 --> 24:40.000
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.333
- Let's do it.
Let's do the surgery.
- Thank you. Thank you.

24:53.834 --> 24:58.583
You all right?
Your face seems a little red.

24:58.583 --> 25:03.291
Oh, it's just hot in there.
You know, with the fire.

25:03.291 --> 25:07.542
Yeah, yeah. Well, actually,
I have a little trick for that.

25:12.709 --> 25:16.959
- You know why this works?
- Why?

25:16.959 --> 25:19.875
Because the vein in your
wrist is a major blood vessel.

25:19.875 --> 25:21.417
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

25:28.458 --> 25:30.417
What are we doing?

25:32.458 --> 25:33.834
I don't know.

25:36.291 --> 25:39.709
[Jimmy] Adam! Get in here.
Let's get Celebrity going again.

25:39.709 --> 25:42.667
All right.
Come on, we'll talk later.

25:45.583 --> 25:49.000
- I don't care.
- What's with the attitude?

25:49.000 --> 25:51.542
[chattering]

25:53.041 --> 25:55.458
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:12.166 --> 26:14.250
OK. What are we doing
out here again?

26:14.250 --> 26:16.750
- I said I wanted a cigarette.
- You don't smoke.

26:16.750 --> 26:18.542
They don't know that.

26:18.542 --> 26:22.166
- You lied to me!
- I never lied to you!

26:22.166 --> 26:24.375
Oh, this is all my fault.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.709
- No, it isn't.
- Yeah, it is.

26:26.709 --> 26:30.083
OK? Heather came to see me.
She told me to stay away
from Adam.

26:30.834 --> 26:31.959
It made me mad.

26:31.959 --> 26:35.041
Marjorie, he asked her
to come here.

26:35.041 --> 26:36.792
He invited her,
and she said no.

26:36.792 --> 26:39.667
We're old friends.
That's what this is about.

26:39.667 --> 26:41.458
You have every right
to be here.

26:41.458 --> 26:43.959
- I have cigarettes.
I'll go get them.
- No!

26:43.959 --> 26:47.625
Gotta give them their space.
Know what I don't understand?

26:47.625 --> 26:50.583
How come we're not inside
and they aren't out here?

26:50.583 --> 26:52.041
How could you
do this to me?

26:52.041 --> 26:54.375
If you didn't have that
stupid fight with Marjorie,

26:54.375 --> 26:56.250
she wouldn't have come!

26:56.250 --> 26:58.750
Why can't you see
that she is after you?

26:58.750 --> 27:03.125
She's playing a game, Adam.
With you and with me.

27:03.125 --> 27:05.667
All right, all right.
Let's just...

27:05.667 --> 27:08.500
Let's just cool down,
all right? Let's go for a walk.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.166
Adam.

27:13.166 --> 27:17.333
I want you to leave,
with me, right now.

27:17.333 --> 27:19.166
I don't want to leave.

27:19.166 --> 27:23.834
You know how important this
weekend is to me. These people
are my family.

27:23.834 --> 27:27.667
This is who I am. You can't ask
me to walk away from my friends.

27:27.667 --> 27:31.333
I'm only asking you
to walk away from one friend.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.208
Her.

27:38.667 --> 27:40.333
I'm not sure I can do that.

27:47.542 --> 27:50.500
[Ivy] Oh! Oh, oh, oh!
I think she's going to leave.

27:50.500 --> 27:51.959
Really?

27:51.959 --> 27:55.834
- Maybe it's meant for the best.
- She should have called first.

27:55.834 --> 28:00.166
- So it's her fault now?
- I didn't say that.

28:00.166 --> 28:03.542
God, what is wrong
with you people?

28:03.542 --> 28:06.792
You're like some
high school clique or something.

28:06.792 --> 28:11.667
God forbid someone new
comes in and you treat
them like a normal person.

28:11.667 --> 28:13.667
I'm new.

28:15.667 --> 28:20.000
OK. So maybe it's just me
you don't like.

28:22.417 --> 28:25.709
Bridget. [sighs]

28:25.709 --> 28:30.417
I say dump his ass.
And the rest of them too.

28:30.417 --> 28:34.750
- "Mansfield Park!"
- Shut up. Shut up. Come on.

28:36.375 --> 28:40.208
She's right.
You never gave her a chance.

28:43.917 --> 28:45.959
Don't listen
to anything she said.

28:48.792 --> 28:53.583
That girl left you at the altar.
I never would have done
that to you.

28:57.125 --> 28:59.166
You have a choice to make.

29:01.250 --> 29:02.792
Her or me.

29:06.166 --> 29:08.083
[exhales]

29:11.291 --> 29:16.291
[sobbing] I guess I fulfilled
all my own prophecies, huh?

29:16.291 --> 29:19.000
I was way too competitive,
I took the best bedroom,

29:19.000 --> 29:22.333
and now I'm
the crying girlfriend.

29:22.333 --> 29:24.500
Heather's crying too.

29:28.667 --> 29:30.667
What did they say
about me out there?

29:30.667 --> 29:33.792
They didn't say anything.
I told them to shut up.

29:37.792 --> 29:40.000
You did?

29:40.000 --> 29:43.250
- You're surprised?
- [panting]

29:44.333 --> 29:46.041
They're your people, Brian.

29:46.041 --> 29:50.458
You guys are really close.
I can see that.
But they are not rooting for us.

29:50.458 --> 29:54.375
We're not rooting for us.
We can't figure out who
gives up their apartment.

29:54.375 --> 29:56.875
We're not moving in together.

30:02.709 --> 30:04.542
Honey, yes, we are.

30:06.208 --> 30:08.500
They'll come around.

30:08.500 --> 30:14.166
And even if they don't...
I don't care.

30:14.166 --> 30:19.041
I'm always comparing myself
to them, to what they have.
And you know what?

30:20.709 --> 30:23.333
What we have
is pretty fantastic.

30:26.875 --> 30:31.208
You just called me honey.
That's the first time
you've ever done that.

30:31.208 --> 30:33.917
- Is it?
- Mm-hm.

30:39.208 --> 30:42.750
I really think I love you.

30:42.750 --> 30:45.542
I love you, Brian.

30:51.750 --> 30:53.583
I love you too.

31:01.625 --> 31:03.542
Jane Austen.

31:06.125 --> 31:08.875
[Jimmy] I just didn't think
it would come to this.

31:08.875 --> 31:12.291
I knew it would
happen all along.

31:12.291 --> 31:13.959
People need to be honest.

31:13.959 --> 31:17.417
You can't say what you
think the other wants to hear.
Say what you want.

31:17.417 --> 31:21.083
I don't know what goes on
between you two, but I think

31:21.083 --> 31:23.959
this is easier to figure out
than you're making it.

31:27.417 --> 31:29.000
Marjorie's right.

31:32.417 --> 31:35.458
Ivy, if you want a cat,
you should have a cat.

31:35.458 --> 31:37.583
- Oh!
- [applause and cheering]

31:37.583 --> 31:40.417
[all] Meow, meow, meow, meow.

31:40.417 --> 31:43.417

Ever since that day that
Marjorie didn't show up
for the wedding,

33:34.041 --> 33:36.875
it's like I've been
living in this dream.

33:36.875 --> 33:40.208
And everything I've done
since then doesn't count.

33:40.208 --> 33:44.625
And I've been criticizing you
for not committing,

33:44.625 --> 33:47.166
but I haven't really
committed to Heather.

33:47.166 --> 33:49.417
I haven't really
given her a chance.

33:51.333 --> 33:54.041
- Last night, Marjorie and I...
- I know, I know.

33:54.041 --> 33:55.709
I saw her come out
of your room.

34:01.500 --> 34:05.750
[groans] Do people
think I'm an ass?

34:05.750 --> 34:08.458
You know, do they think
I'm a self-entitled jerk

34:08.458 --> 34:11.709
who doesn't think about the
consequences? Because I do.

34:13.291 --> 34:15.375
You know, I think about it.

34:17.375 --> 34:19.375
I'm just confused.

34:21.583 --> 34:23.291
What do you think
I should do?

34:25.542 --> 34:27.375
I can't tell you.

34:28.875 --> 34:32.125
Because you know.

34:32.125 --> 34:34.041
That's why we're friends.

34:35.375 --> 34:37.542
You know what's right for you
and do it.

34:37.542 --> 34:41.709
You don't care if it looks right
to other people or if it's safe.

34:41.709 --> 34:46.166
Well, that's what you need to do
now. And you know what?

34:47.417 --> 34:50.000
Everyone will survive.

34:51.500 --> 34:54.542
- Just do what you do.
- [groans]

34:56.375 --> 34:58.041
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

34:58.041 --> 34:59.542
What are you doing?

34:59.542 --> 35:01.625
Making sandwiches
for everyone for the road.

35:01.625 --> 35:04.667
- I was gonna do that.
- Yeah, I know, but you seem

35:04.667 --> 35:08.375
like you're pretty busy
with the kids and Carrie
and everything, so...

35:13.667 --> 35:15.709
Bridget, I'm sorry.

35:15.709 --> 35:18.959
I'm sorry for the way I behaved
towards you this weekend.

35:18.959 --> 35:22.250
We are overprotective of Brian.

35:22.250 --> 35:26.375
It's just he's very, very
special to us, you know?

35:26.375 --> 35:30.375
And he's always around
and I think we feel jealous
to see him...

35:30.375 --> 35:32.125
...loving someone else.

35:34.250 --> 35:36.959
I barely know the guy
so I have no excuse at all,

35:36.959 --> 35:40.917
except you're the hottest girl
here and my husband's the
hottest guy, so...

35:40.917 --> 35:43.667
I don't think your husband's
the hottest guy here.

35:43.667 --> 35:45.834
- Oh, you don't?
- No.

35:45.834 --> 35:48.917
Then, honey,
let's be best friends.

35:48.917 --> 35:51.291
- Who do you think
is the hottest guy?
- Yeah.

35:51.291 --> 35:53.792
- Can I be totally honest?
- Absolutely.

35:53.792 --> 35:56.417
- Dave.
- Oh, my God!

35:56.417 --> 35:59.917
- He's totally hot!
- I cannot wait to tell him!

35:59.917 --> 36:02.166
My God!
I'm having a girly conversation!

36:02.166 --> 36:04.583
Yes, you are!
And I love your earrings.

36:04.583 --> 36:06.166
- I love yours.
- Thank you.

36:08.542 --> 36:13.917
You know, Marjorie,
last night was fantastic.

36:15.875 --> 36:18.125
And it felt so familiar.

36:23.375 --> 36:25.041
But...?

36:31.208 --> 36:34.959
It's too late... for us.

36:40.709 --> 36:43.166
- I love you.
- [sobs]

36:45.458 --> 36:48.792
And a part of me
will always love you.

36:51.250 --> 36:53.417
But I can't erase the past.

36:57.250 --> 36:59.834
And I don't want
to start from there.

37:03.166 --> 37:04.917
I want to start fresh.

37:14.750 --> 37:16.834
Is there something
you want to say?

37:18.917 --> 37:20.834
I know that we
could be happy.

37:26.083 --> 37:28.750
I got scared
and I made a mistake.

37:32.959 --> 37:35.375
You know...

37:35.375 --> 37:39.792
...I believe that there
isn't just one person
out there to be happy with.

37:41.542 --> 37:43.709

I just don't want to.

Well, you can. And you can
call me whenever you want.
