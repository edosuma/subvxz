Reddington's handler
from Moscow, Stepanov,

03:00.096 --> 03:01.848
Townsend and I were questioning him.

03:01.931 --> 03:04.851
Whatever he told Townsend,
whatever he knows--

03:04.934 --> 03:08.354
Whatever he gave up,
it caused Townsend to try to kill you?

03:08.438 --> 03:10.773
In what world does that make any sense?

03:10.857 --> 03:13.359

-What do the feds know?

03:13.443 --> 03:14.861

-Rocco is dead.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.657
That's bad, but this is good.

03:19.741 --> 03:23.995
The Russian can prove Reddington's N-13.
Right? He's the key to all this.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.706
-The feds now know about him, it's good.
-I think so.

03:26.789 --> 03:30.501
Whatever Townsend learned,
Reddington's been trying to hide.

03:30.585 --> 03:34.422
I don't know what this has to do
with why Townsend is trying to kill me,

03:34.505 --> 03:36.758
but I sense we're very close to the truth.

03:36.841 --> 03:39.510

04:08.081 --> 04:10.541
I hope you have a lead on Keen.

04:10.625 --> 04:14.295
I don't. I have a lead on the hitman
contracted to find her.

04:14.379 --> 04:17.298
-Townsend hired a hitman?
-To find her.

04:17.382 --> 04:20.260
I suspect he'll wait on the hit
until I'm there to see it.

04:20.343 --> 04:23.554
-What do we know about him?
-He's known as The Protean.

04:23.638 --> 04:27.475
And like his mythic namesake,
who possessed the gift of prophecy,

04:27.558 --> 04:31.312
he escapes those who want
to question him by changing his form.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.231

04:33.314 --> 04:34.816

A photo? An alias?

04:42.657 --> 04:45.368
He's based in Europe.
I've never seen a photo.

12:26.620 --> 12:31.208
-See, that wasn't so hard.
-If anyone finds out, I'll be fired.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.627
You completely missed
the moral of the story.

12:33.711 --> 12:39.216
-It wasn't that you'd kill Mr. Beaks?
-In a microwave? What do you take me for?

12:39.300 --> 12:42.928
Now, if you had a nice white Burgundy
we could braise him in...

12:43.012 --> 12:45.097
No. Come on, Max!

12:45.181 --> 12:47.933
The moral
of poor Mr. Spencer's tale of woe

12:48.017 --> 12:50.895
is that you should never worry
about betraying your workplace,

12:50.978 --> 12:54.690
because given the chance,
your workplace will betray you.

12:54.773 --> 12:57.985
Loyalty to individuals. Relationships.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.279
That's what makes the world go round.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.745
We've confirmed the IDs. It was her team.

13:07.828 --> 13:08.704
Everyone?

13:08.787 --> 13:11.207
<i>Esi Jackson, Skip Hadley, and a Jane Doe.</i>

13:11.290 --> 13:13.083
<i>-Probably security.</i>
-But no Keen?

13:13.167 --> 13:16.045
No. Either she wasn't here
or she got away.

13:16.128 --> 13:19.590
-Or Townsend got her. Witnesses?
-No. Neighbors didn't see a thing.

13:19.673 --> 13:21.634
-Ressler.
-Hang on.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.514
They recovered blood
from under her fingernails.

13:26.597 --> 13:27.681
She put up a fight.

13:27.765 --> 13:31.185
If the lab can find a match,
she'll have ID'd her killer.

13:31.268 --> 13:33.604
And the man who Townsend hired
to hunt down Keen.

13:33.687 --> 13:36.899
Hey, we're running forensics
on DNA and shell casings.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.652
All we know until it comes back is this:

13:39.735 --> 13:41.862
Keen had protection. Now she's on her own.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.615
-[Cooper] <i>Can you reach her?</i>
-[Ressler] <i>No. I would if I could.</i>

13:44.698 --> 13:47.826
Reddington predicted Townsend
would come after everyone close to Keen.

13:47.910 --> 13:50.162
That includes us, so be careful.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.498
<i>Keen's not the only one</i>
<i>with a target on her back.</i>

13:52.581 --> 13:53.499
Copy.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.126
[suspenseful music playing]

14:17.147 --> 14:18.315
Hello?

14:32.204 --> 14:33.205
[cell phone chimes]

14:40.754 --> 14:43.591
[woman] "There were few birds
in this part of the forest.

14:43.674 --> 14:47.720
For birds love the open country
where there's plenty of sunshine--"

14:47.803 --> 14:50.389
-I need to grab Agnes.
-Yeah, sure. Agnes.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.475
"Now and then..."

14:53.559 --> 14:56.437
Hi, your mom called.
You're getting picked up early.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.980
What's the password?

14:58.606 --> 14:59.857
Chocolate sauce.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.734
That's two words.

15:01.817 --> 15:04.028
Yes. But it's delicious.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.237
So it's you.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.781
The one Mom put here to look out for me.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.575
I don't know what you mean.

15:09.658 --> 15:12.036
Does the school know you're an agent?

15:12.119 --> 15:14.121
I'm just the math teacher.

15:14.204 --> 15:16.081
You're too smart for your own good.

15:23.547 --> 15:24.506
[woman] Can I help you?

15:24.590 --> 15:26.759
Hi. Uh, I'm new to the area.

15:26.842 --> 15:29.053
I'd like to speak to someone
about enrollment.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.305
Of course. If you'd just sign in.

15:31.388 --> 15:32.723
That's it. Let's go.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.224
May I?

15:35.392 --> 15:36.226
Hmm?

15:36.810 --> 15:39.939
-The pen.
-Right. Of course.

15:40.022 --> 15:40.898
Thank you.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.859
Come on. We have to meet Mrs. French.

15:49.865 --> 15:52.493
[dramatic music playing]

15:55.037 --> 15:57.539
Would you excuse me
for one second, please?

16:15.349 --> 16:18.394
There have got to be more
than 5000 names here.

16:18.477 --> 16:19.311
[Raymond] Yes.

16:19.395 --> 16:24.149
Down from 60,000-some-odd American men
who enter the U.S. through Customs daily.

16:24.233 --> 16:27.277
Between the probable entry points
and what little I know about him,

16:27.361 --> 16:30.739
that's the list of people
who fit the description of the man.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.032
The dead one.

16:32.658 --> 16:36.161
The man I'm looking for
takes the identities of dead people.

16:36.245 --> 16:41.000
Golly, that's smart.
Who thinks of something like that?

16:41.083 --> 16:43.919
Someone resourceful and dangerous,

16:44.003 --> 16:45.838
with a keen sense of irony.

16:45.921 --> 16:49.967
Paula, the phone-company database,
I know it won't cover everyone.

16:50.050 --> 16:53.637
Can you scan the names through it
to get some numbers?

16:53.721 --> 16:56.432
I bet
he's an interesting conversationalist.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.268
There's some urgency here.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.812
Then you're lucky it's bingo night.

17:01.895 --> 17:02.771
Bingo.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.691
Betty-Lu's calling the numbers.
She's a hoot.

17:05.774 --> 17:07.526
About the database.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.237
What do you think
I'm talking about, silly?

17:10.320 --> 17:12.156
You're talking about bingo.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.783
[scoffs] The youth today.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.161
Don't worry about the phone company.

17:17.244 --> 17:21.832
Getting the numbers is the easy part,
the hard part is calling them all.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.209
That's why you need bingo.

17:24.835 --> 17:29.048
You want a quick answer
to which one of these people is dead,

17:29.131 --> 17:32.551
50 alta cockers is your ticket.

17:32.634 --> 17:34.261
[cell phone rings]

17:34.970 --> 17:36.972
Mrs. French? Hey. Is she okay?

17:37.765 --> 17:39.933
So you got her? There were no problems?

17:42.644 --> 17:45.147
That is such a relief, can you put her on?

17:46.565 --> 17:49.026
Hey, honey, how was your day?

17:50.652 --> 17:52.071
No, everything's fine.

17:52.154 --> 17:55.657
I was just being extra careful.
So tell me about your day.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.201
I wanna hear everything.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.083
[pensive music playing]

18:12.091 --> 18:15.677
-[cell phone buzzing]
-[sighs]

18:19.515 --> 18:20.349
Hello.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.935
What's going on? I wanted updates on Keen.

18:23.018 --> 18:25.813
Work in progress.

18:25.896 --> 18:26.855
<i>You don't have her?</i>

18:28.524 --> 18:30.359
Hello? I am talking to you.

18:30.442 --> 18:36.031
There was a fly in the ointment,
but things seem to be back on track.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.324
What does that mean?

18:37.407 --> 18:40.536
I'm paying you a fortune.
I expect more than three-word responses--

18:43.747 --> 18:45.124
[keypad beeping]

18:45.207 --> 18:46.291
[line ringing]

18:46.375 --> 18:48.377
[cell phone buzzing]

18:50.003 --> 18:51.755
Do not ever hang up on me.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.341
I am your employer.
When I ask for specifics, I demand--

18:54.424 --> 18:56.093
<i>I don't like being lectured,</i>

18:56.176 --> 18:59.763
nor do I like conversing
when there's nothing to discuss,

18:59.847 --> 19:03.183
so I suggest you hear me
when I assure you this job

19:03.267 --> 19:07.020
isn't as simple as the dispatching
of a gun runner or a CEO.

19:07.771 --> 19:11.900
Now, our target
is a very clever fugitive in hiding...

19:12.860 --> 19:16.071
which makes the task at hand
decidedly more burdensome.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.158
That means it'll take time,
which you can't change.

19:19.700 --> 19:24.288
You will need to demonstrate patience,
which is as unfortunate as it is true.

19:24.371 --> 19:27.332
This is my explanation,
as well as our last communication

19:27.416 --> 19:29.168
until I know I can deliver Miss Keen.

19:29.251 --> 19:32.462
When that time comes, I will notify you.

19:32.546 --> 19:39.511
Until then, try and compose yourself
and know you are in capable hands.

19:52.649 --> 19:54.401
Anything from the crime lab?

19:54.484 --> 19:55.319
Nothing good.

19:55.402 --> 19:58.906
No match in the database to the DNA
pulled from under Esi's fingernails.

19:58.989 --> 20:01.909
-No prints on the shell casings.
-This guy's good.

20:01.992 --> 20:04.620
All we know is the shells came from a 9mm.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.539
That's what we use.
Advise local law enforcement.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.709
Push the ballistics.
Anytime, anywhere a 9mm gets discharged,

20:10.792 --> 20:13.462
-I wanna know about it.
-I'll notify the D.C. field office.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.130
[Cooper] What about Keen? Updates?

20:15.214 --> 20:17.424
No, nothing. No further contact.

20:17.507 --> 20:21.136
-[Aram] <i>We have no way of reaching her.</i>
-[Cooper] <i>Somebody better find a way to,</i>

20:21.220 --> 20:23.597
because she isn't safe.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.892
What do you mean? Who found you?

20:26.975 --> 20:28.393
<i>They were in your house?</i>

20:28.477 --> 20:31.897
The lock to the back door was picked.
The office is a mess.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.068
Liz, I think they were on my laptop.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.402
Are you safe now?

20:37.486 --> 20:40.614
<i>Yeah, but can you tell me what's going on?</i>

20:41.198 --> 20:43.784
<i>Am I crazy or is this about Reddington?</i>

20:44.660 --> 20:46.245
It's more complicated.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.914
How complicated does it have to be
for him to find me?

20:48.997 --> 20:50.499
I'm in witness protection, right?

20:50.582 --> 20:52.960
Listen, you need to leave the house.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.587
I don't think you're safe.
I'm gonna give you an address.

20:55.671 --> 20:56.588
<i>You have a pen?</i>

20:56.672 --> 20:57.506
Yeah.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.097
Go.

21:05.180 --> 21:07.516
<i>2319 Central. In D.C.</i>

21:07.599 --> 21:09.685
<i>It's a paint store.</i>
<i>There's an alley behind it.</i>

21:09.768 --> 21:11.561
<i>Meet me there at 9:00.</i>

21:11.645 --> 21:13.522
Liz, tell me what's going on.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.358
I'll explain everything tonight.
Just meet me there at 9:00.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.151
<i>And, Jen, be careful.</i>

21:21.280 --> 21:22.114
[sobbing]

21:22.197 --> 21:23.323
Oh...

21:23.991 --> 21:27.661
No. No, no, no.

21:27.744 --> 21:29.454
Don't cry, honey lamb.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.541
You did the right thing.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.256
[chattering]

21:39.339 --> 21:41.591
Hello? [microphone feeds back]
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.260
Uh... Sorry.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.805
Good evening, everyone. I'm Steven.

21:47.306 --> 21:51.643
Uh... I'm a good friend
of your good friend, Paula...

21:52.811 --> 21:55.480
which I guess makes us all good friends.

21:56.023 --> 21:59.651
Unfortunately, Betty-Lu has
come down with a little something.

21:59.735 --> 22:03.488
So I'll be your caller tonight.

22:03.572 --> 22:09.369
But before we begin,
I have been asked to remind everyone

22:09.453 --> 22:12.789
of a few housekeeping items.

22:12.873 --> 22:16.418
Okay, the first,
the rescheduled pancake feed

22:16.501 --> 22:20.714
is this Saturday at Fire Hall Number 3.

22:20.797 --> 22:24.134
Tickets are $5, or $6 at the door.

22:24.217 --> 22:25.552
That'll be good fun.

22:25.635 --> 22:29.222
What's not so fun
is the member-at-large dues

22:29.306 --> 22:31.892
are now due to national headquarters.

22:31.975 --> 22:35.687
So, please, please,
don't be late with those.

22:35.771 --> 22:39.357
Finally, Brandy says there are
still a few raffle tickets left

22:39.441 --> 22:43.403
for the spring fundraiser.
They're $10 each.

22:43.487 --> 22:49.576
First place is a quarter beef.
Second place is five uncured hams.

22:49.659 --> 22:53.663
All donated by Merlin Degner,
thank you for that, Merlin.

22:53.747 --> 22:58.877
Yes, absolutely. And, of course,
all proceeds go to the Veteran's Lodge.

22:58.960 --> 23:02.798
Alrighty, good.
Okay, now, with that out of the way,

23:02.881 --> 23:04.216
I'm very excited

23:04.299 --> 23:07.928
because tonight we're going
to be doing things a little differently.

23:08.011 --> 23:11.932
Tonight, instead of the
Pot of Gold Progressive,

23:12.015 --> 23:15.769
we're going to play
a new variation of bingo.

23:15.852 --> 23:21.525
Does everyone still have the sheets
of paper that were on your chair

23:21.608 --> 23:23.110
when you arrived?

23:23.193 --> 23:29.157
Okay, great. Yes. These are lists
of names and telephone numbers.

23:29.241 --> 23:33.328
The game is to get out your cellphones,

23:33.411 --> 23:37.457
and to call the people on your lists

23:37.541 --> 23:41.628
and verify that they are
who they say they are.

23:41.711 --> 23:46.716
And each completed list earns you $100!

23:47.342 --> 23:48.176
What'd he say?

23:48.260 --> 23:53.932
That's $100 for every completed list,
and here's the really fun part:

23:54.015 --> 23:59.521
The grand prize winner
will also receive $1000

23:59.604 --> 24:03.984
if he or she is able
to reach someone who is...

24:05.152 --> 24:06.153
Who is dead.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.947
How is that like bingo?

24:09.030 --> 24:10.365
[Raymond] It's a game of chance!

24:10.448 --> 24:13.702
Which lucky winner will find the dead man?

24:13.785 --> 24:17.330
It could be you, ma'am, or you, sir.

24:17.998 --> 24:20.250
I'm sorry, excuse me, madam.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.169
I want to play bingo.

24:22.252 --> 24:24.171
This isn't the routine.

24:24.254 --> 24:27.424
[Raymond] Right.
Don't you sometimes wonder if

24:27.507 --> 24:30.719
the routine feels like the same old thing?

24:30.802 --> 24:32.012
Whereas tonight--

24:32.095 --> 24:33.680
[crowd grumbling indistinctly]

24:33.763 --> 24:35.473
You're losing them.

24:35.557 --> 24:36.766
Yes.

24:36.850 --> 24:39.352
Okay, hold on.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.479
Everyone, listen up.

24:41.563 --> 24:45.483
Before you get your markers in a mash...

24:46.067 --> 24:49.154
what this man isn't telling you

24:49.237 --> 24:54.201
is that his name isn't Steve Homan,

24:54.284 --> 24:59.414
it's Father Steve Homan
from Prince of Peace.

24:59.497 --> 25:02.667
And he's being too damned nice.

25:02.751 --> 25:06.755
The truth is one of his deacons

25:07.255 --> 25:10.550
stole 134 grand

25:10.634 --> 25:16.306
from the church's
gymnasium renovation fund

25:16.389 --> 25:17.807
and skipped town.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.267
How much did she say?

25:19.351 --> 25:24.314
If you need to know,
Father Steve hired a private detective,

25:24.397 --> 25:27.901
and the private dick thinks

25:27.984 --> 25:32.739
the thieving heathen has fled the country

25:32.822 --> 25:39.371

of someone who is dearly departed

25:39.454 --> 25:42.540
and on this list.

25:42.624 --> 25:44.668
[crowd speaking indistinctly]

25:47.671 --> 25:51.299
Now, I should've been straight up.

25:52.634 --> 25:56.972
But Father Steve is in a real bad place.

25:57.889 --> 26:01.893
His faith's being tested and I just--

26:02.978 --> 26:06.856
I thought maybe we could help.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.858
Hell yeah, we can help.

26:08.942 --> 26:10.568
Why didn't you just say so?

26:10.652 --> 26:13.613
Well, okay, then.

26:13.697 --> 26:19.494
Whoever finds the dead man wins $1000,
the Good Lord's blessing

26:19.577 --> 26:23.832

of my garlic-butter cockle dip!

[laughing]

26:29.879 --> 26:30.964
My heavens, Paula.

26:31.047 --> 26:33.800
My faith in faith has been restored.

26:43.893 --> 26:45.895
[suspenseful music playing]

27:02.329 --> 27:03.663
Tell me you're okay.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.457
-Drive.
-What?

27:05.540 --> 27:09.294
It's a trap. The man,
whoever he is, he forced me to call.

27:09.377 --> 27:11.838
-He followed me here--
-Get down!

27:11.921 --> 27:14.257
[dramatic music playing]

27:14.341 --> 27:15.258
Hold on.

27:38.656 --> 27:40.241
[pensive music playing]

27:40.325 --> 27:42.077
Liz, he shot me.

27:42.619 --> 27:43.578
[panting]

27:43.661 --> 27:44.788
Oh, my God.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.582
-Oh, my God. I'm gonna die.
-No one's gonna die.

27:47.665 --> 27:49.918
Look at all this blood. I'm gonna die.

27:50.001 --> 27:51.878
[Liz] We'll be at the hospital
in ten minutes.

27:51.961 --> 27:55.090
Here. Take my hand.
You're not dying, okay?

27:55.173 --> 27:57.759
You're hurt. It's pretty bad,
but you're not gonna die.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.761
So forget about that. Okay?

28:00.470 --> 28:02.305
Look at what he did to me.

28:03.431 --> 28:05.350
What did I ever do to him?

28:05.433 --> 28:07.143
You didn't do anything.

28:07.227 --> 28:09.646
-I did something
-This is not your fault.

28:11.356 --> 28:12.857
I was your sister.

28:20.824 --> 28:24.953
We got blood on the scene,
broken glass, and this: 9 mm shell casing.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.455
Consistent with the caliber
of the gun on your BOLO.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.457
Someone was shot, but you don't know who.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.626
Responding officers
didn't find any bodies,

28:31.709 --> 28:33.461
not the victim nor the shooter.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.796
But they did find this.

28:37.215 --> 28:39.884
They took out her team.
Keen must know that.

28:40.510 --> 28:45.598
So why get lured into an alley?
I mean, what was the bait? Or who?

28:45.682 --> 28:47.600
[concierge on phone]
<i>Good evening. Selden Hotel.</i>

28:48.435 --> 28:51.563
Last call he made was to the Selden Hotel.
Could be nothing.

28:51.646 --> 28:54.816
Or that's where he's staying
and he was complaining about the Wi-Fi.

28:54.899 --> 28:58.319
The Selden's got over 1000 rooms.
We don't even know if he's staying there.

28:58.403 --> 29:02.615
If he is, we don't know what he looks like
or what name he's registered under.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.951
Looks like we're going door to door.

29:08.872 --> 29:09.748
My cat...

29:11.541 --> 29:12.625
Sierra...

29:13.918 --> 29:15.545
you have to feed her.

29:16.129 --> 29:17.922
I'll take care of Sierra, don't worry.

29:18.006 --> 29:20.550
She'll be fat and happy
by the time you come home.

29:20.633 --> 29:21.801
[Jennifer] I'm scared.

29:21.885 --> 29:23.720
[Liz] It's gonna be okay.
We're almost there.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.139
Hold me.

29:26.222 --> 29:28.183
I am. I'm not gonna let go.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.476
Hold me.

29:29.559 --> 29:32.061
I will. As soon as we get to the hospital.

29:32.145 --> 29:35.482
And when you get out of the hospital,
this will be over.

29:35.565 --> 29:39.569
All of it. No more running,
no more witness protection.

29:39.652 --> 29:45.074
We can buy a place. A nice place.
Wherever you want. I got money now, so...

29:45.700 --> 29:46.743
Okay?

29:47.452 --> 29:48.703
We can be together.

29:50.663 --> 29:53.583
You, me, Agnes, and Sierra.

29:55.668 --> 29:56.628
I promise.

29:59.255 --> 30:02.675
There's gonna be a happy ending. Okay?

30:04.969 --> 30:07.263
We're gonna live happily ever--

Arthur, you had the egg salad.

30:42.048 --> 30:46.427
I'm with LaGuardia Airport.
I have Mr. Smelling's suitcase.

30:46.511 --> 30:49.013
-I had the liverwurst.
-Liverwurst?

30:49.097 --> 30:51.808
Yes, I'm calling from GemSoul.

30:51.891 --> 30:55.562
We produce diamonds
from your loved one's ashes.

30:55.645 --> 30:58.857
Has anyone
in your immediate family died recently?

30:58.940 --> 31:00.692
Bernice, I have your Reuben.

31:00.775 --> 31:01.609
Thank you.

31:01.693 --> 31:02.652
[polka music playing]

31:02.735 --> 31:05.864
Your friends are wildly imaginative.

31:06.739 --> 31:11.077
About a year ago,
I started a thrillers-only book club.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.921
Looks like B is for bingo.

31:22.005 --> 31:25.258
And it doesn't bother you,
helping me find some criminal,

31:25.341 --> 31:28.428
not knowing
what might happen to him if I do?

31:29.345 --> 31:30.346
[chuckles]

31:31.014 --> 31:35.393
John. Matzo ball soup.
Just broth and ball.

31:35.476 --> 31:37.604
I think you're a good egg.

31:37.687 --> 31:42.025
A bit poached for my taste,
but you wanna do what's right,

31:42.108 --> 31:43.651
and I am tickled

31:43.735 --> 31:48.281
to carry on the family tradition
of helping you get it done.

31:48.364 --> 31:49.282
Bingo!

31:50.867 --> 31:53.995
-What did you find, good sir?
-The dirty deacon.

31:54.078 --> 31:56.039
His name is Rhys Engel.

31:56.122 --> 31:59.709
From Carlsburg, Illinois.
Died in London two days ago.

31:59.792 --> 32:01.628
Bingo, indeed.

32:02.128 --> 32:07.091
As soon as I have confirmation,
the grand prize is yours.

32:07.175 --> 32:10.637
[laughs] The dirty deacon.
Tell me his name again.

32:11.220 --> 32:13.514
Rhys Engel is The Protean's alias?

32:13.598 --> 32:16.017
That's the needle.
Now all we need is the haystack.

32:16.100 --> 32:20.146
We have it. The Selden Hotel.
Ressler and Park are on their way now.

-Yes, it is.

I must say, it makes for
a very productive work environment.

Excuse me. Agents Ressler and Park, FBI.

33:00.645 --> 33:03.147
We need to know
if a Rhys Engel is registered here.

33:03.231 --> 33:08.277
-And if he is, we need his room number.
-Mr. Engel is in room 1212.

I've got a good feeling about this.

-Twelve's my lucky number.

-It's all good.

I used to believe in salvation.

I don't believe in that anymore.

We both want "Wreck of the
Edmund Fitzgerald" played at our funerals.

34:58.888 --> 35:01.140
And because of that
pathetic bonding experience?

35:01.224 --> 35:03.309
I got access
to Engel's hotel Wi-Fi account.

35:03.392 --> 35:06.979
And the first thing he did was access
the DMV database to run a license plate.

35:07.063 --> 35:10.900
-Was it the car Keen was driving?
-If it is, he could be on his way to her.

35:10.983 --> 35:13.861
It was a blue Subaru Outback
registered to a Lisa Grant,

35:13.945 --> 35:15.613
237 Tacoma Drive.

35:15.696 --> 35:19.408
Could be someone helping her,
or someone whose car she stole.

35:19.492 --> 35:20.660
It's our best lead.

is anything but pathetic.

Okay. We'll send someone to pick her up.

but double the bounty.

That won't be necessary.

when I could deliver Keen.

-Aram, do not come any closer.

I'm unarmed.

Place your arms through the
steering wheel, then lace your fingers.

I'm gonna step closer and open your door.

After that,
release the seatbelt and step out.

38:59.211 --> 39:01.547
Ressler, if you open that door--

-Liz, put the gun down.
-Not until I get the answer I need.

39:05.801 --> 39:10.598
Ressler, listen to me.
He killed my sister. And Esi, and Skip--

-Keen, put the gun down.
-Please do not do this.

39:13.976 --> 39:15.353
I'm gonna open the door now.

39:15.436 --> 39:17.563
Keep that right hand on the wheel.

release your seatbelt, and step out.

-She'll shoot me.

-Undo the belt.
-The gun--

Nobody is gonna shoot anyone. Right, Liz?

39:31.744 --> 39:32.828

-Get her off of him.
-Tell me where he is.

No! Do not die
before you tell me where he is!

No!

[Cooper] <i>We have her in custody.</i>
<i>I wanted you to know she's safe.</i>

40:06.987 --> 40:08.447
Harold, bring her here.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.075
-Excuse me?
<i>-You can't take her in.</i>

40:11.158 --> 40:12.827
That's exactly what I'll do.

40:12.910 --> 40:16.414
It breaks my heart,
but Elizabeth is a fugitive, a criminal.

40:16.497 --> 40:19.708
She'll be treated as one.
You can't save her from that.

40:19.792 --> 40:22.753
-I'm the only one who can save her.
-Not today.

40:23.254 --> 40:26.507
Harold, I know you. I know how you think.

40:26.590 --> 40:28.551
What you hope in your heart.

40:29.051 --> 40:30.428
<i>That the system works,</i>

40:30.511 --> 40:35.808
that Elizabeth can be prosecuted,
incarcerated, and rehabilitated.

40:35.891 --> 40:37.226
It's a lie.

40:37.309 --> 40:42.731
This is the last thing
I ever wanted or intended,

40:43.315 --> 40:48.362
but you and I both know
Elizabeth Keen is a criminal.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.739
<i>She will never be an agent again.</i>

40:51.323 --> 40:53.033
<i>She will never be a civilian.</i>

40:55.077 --> 41:00.416
Her only hope for survival
exists in my world.

41:01.459 --> 41:02.501
I hope you're wrong.

41:03.252 --> 41:04.545
I wish I were.
