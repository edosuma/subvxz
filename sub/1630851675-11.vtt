of my business plan.

another business, too.

movie production.

00:29.083 --> 00:31.042
- We're lookin' pretty good
for the music video.

00:31.042 --> 00:33.292
- You're telling me
that you're not gonna be

00:33.292 --> 00:35.167
at several
of these scenes.

00:35.167 --> 00:36.125
- What do you want me to do?

00:36.125 --> 00:39.709
Just drop everything
that I'm doing?

00:39.709 --> 00:43.042
Find somebody else
to do that sh-- for free.

00:43.042 --> 00:45.042
You just want me
to be there for you

00:45.042 --> 00:47.125
as if what I have going on
is not important.

00:47.125 --> 00:48.417
- I'm sorry.

00:48.417 --> 00:50.584
- Karen, you went on
a diatribe

00:50.584 --> 00:54.250
as far as Jamal is concerned,
and consequently,

00:54.250 --> 00:56.083
it did hurt me
and my children.

00:56.083 --> 00:58.876
- If it hurt her children,
I'm sorry.

00:58.876 --> 01:03.918
- Amen.
- That's beautiful.

01:03.918 --> 01:05.959

to this pretty face

01:05.959 --> 01:08.292
is stayin' in the shade.

01:08.292 --> 01:10.250
- If you wanna pop off,

01:10.250 --> 01:13.083
I'll be happy
to get you adjusted.

01:13.083 --> 01:15.375
- I may keep you waiting,
but trust me,

01:15.375 --> 01:17.751
I'm worth it.

01:17.751 --> 01:22.167
- The only thing messier
than two boys is me.

01:22.167 --> 01:26.626
- My blessings are many,
and my patience is none.

01:26.626 --> 01:29.792
- This professor doesn't
just grade on the curve.

01:29.792 --> 01:31.626
She sets the curve.

01:31.626 --> 01:33.959

a little distressed,

adding to my stress.

music video week.

We'd put the pillows.

All right, so, Grace,

I'm taking you

just back up.

"Let your daddy handle this."

video music shoot tomorrow.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.292
- Oh, really?
- I have no idea

08:53.292 --> 08:56.209

but Candiace, you know,

08:56.209 --> 08:58.417

a "Fast and Furious" girl

08:58.417 --> 09:00.584

for my music video.

You gotta show me
that you're worthy

09:06.792 --> 09:08.209

a little bit of a stressor

09:12.626 --> 09:14.626

09:14.626 --> 09:17.417
- Her husband,
they're having issues

09:17.417 --> 09:19.417

the "husbandger".

09:19.417 --> 09:20.959

09:20.959 --> 09:22.459

is her manager.

nine years ago?

09:30.751 --> 09:32.375
- Yeah, about that.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

09:32.375 --> 09:34.667
- And, I was trying
to have you so involved

09:34.667 --> 09:36.792
because it was new to me,

09:36.792 --> 09:39.083
but then I realized
very quickly

09:39.083 --> 09:40.959
that you needed
to get the hell away

09:40.959 --> 09:43.417
from anything
that I wanted to do

09:43.417 --> 09:45.959
because you can't have
two CEOs.

09:45.959 --> 09:47.876
- Because it's too much
emotions involved

09:47.876 --> 09:49.959
in any conversation
and decision.

09:49.959 --> 09:51.584
- Exactly.
- As opposed to looking at it

09:51.584 --> 09:52.584

09:52.584 --> 09:56.417

you are advising me.

09:58.542 --> 10:00.459
This is a great space,

10:00.459 --> 10:01.584
and you brought
the architectural.

10:01.584 --> 10:03.417

about a door location.

10:05.542 --> 10:07.542
I'll make sure

10:07.542 --> 10:10.792
When you get emotionally
intertwined and involved,

to your home life

10:16.334 --> 10:17.709
when your bedroom
becomes affected,

10:17.709 --> 10:19.501
then your marriage
is going to flunder, right?

10:19.501 --> 10:20.709
- Mm-hmm.

10:20.709 --> 10:22.542
- Gordon and I, we actually
had a little hiccup

10:22.542 --> 10:23.584
in the beginning
of our relationship

10:23.584 --> 10:26.209
with him trying
to manage me

10:26.209 --> 10:28.209
when I initially
got involved

10:28.209 --> 10:30.501

I had to put my foot down.

you are not my father.

10:32.417 --> 10:35.042
"You do not tell me
what to do, okay?"

10:35.042 --> 10:35.918
And I don't want Candiace

10:35.918 --> 10:37.918
to just throw
the whole marriage away

10:37.918 --> 10:40.501

is your manager.

17:03.334 --> 17:09.083
- He, uh, would like to
get into moviemaking.

17:09.083 --> 17:12.042
Michael wants to get
into the movie business.

17:12.042 --> 17:14.083
Kind of came out
of nowhere to me,

17:14.083 --> 17:15.959
but you know.
- Well, hold on.

17:15.959 --> 17:17.918
This is, like,
a kind of a, like,

17:17.918 --> 17:20.792
a mind-blowing conversation
'cause that's not a cousin

17:20.792 --> 17:22.209
to real estate.

17:22.209 --> 17:25.125
I remember when
our kids were small.

17:25.125 --> 17:26.792
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, I couldn't even think

17:26.792 --> 17:30.918
of gettin' into something else
because financially, you know,

17:30.918 --> 17:32.501
I had to build
what I had.

17:32.501 --> 17:34.459
- Yeah, his business
is pretty established,

17:34.459 --> 17:36.459
and he's financially
pretty secure,

17:36.459 --> 17:38.751
and we would do it together.
I'm like, okay.

17:38.751 --> 17:39.959
He's like, "If you wanna
star on the movie..."

17:39.959 --> 17:42.375
Okay, like, hold on.
- Uh-oh.

17:42.375 --> 17:44.792
Starting a venture together.

17:44.792 --> 17:45.667
- Again.
- A second one.

17:45.667 --> 17:47.125
- A second one.
- Yes, well, hold on.

17:47.125 --> 17:49.334
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:49.334 --> 17:51.083

17:51.083 --> 17:52.083
All that matters,
is how you feel.

17:52.083 --> 17:55.250
Shut down your restaurant,
shut down your event tonight,

17:55.250 --> 17:56.751
and this marriage
will be over.

17:56.751 --> 17:59.042
I learned a lot from
having that business

17:59.042 --> 18:03.083
and how to not have
that affect my marriage.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.334
Now that I've had
a little bit of time to simmer,

18:05.334 --> 18:08.042
it doesn't feel
super farfetched now

18:08.042 --> 18:08.959
to get into
the movie business,

18:08.959 --> 18:11.792
but there's still
quite a few cons, and I--

18:11.792 --> 18:14.959
I'm not all the way there
because we have to have

18:14.959 --> 18:18.167
our respective roles and
not interfere in what

18:18.167 --> 18:19.417
the other person
is doing,

18:19.417 --> 18:22.959
and I'm not sure Michael
is capable of that.

18:22.959 --> 18:25.167

I'm sure you'll--

18:25.167 --> 18:27.584

bein'-- messy Mia
has come out.

34:39.083 --> 34:40.167
[laughing]
- What happened?

34:40.167 --> 34:42.834
- She over there askin'
if Chris is on payroll.

34:42.834 --> 34:43.876
- Is he?

34:43.876 --> 34:46.292
- Is-- that's none
of my business.

34:46.292 --> 34:47.292
- I'd like to know.
- I would not.

34:47.292 --> 34:49.459
- Well, if he is, he shouldn't
be paid today.

34:49.459 --> 34:50.542
Dock the pay today.
He ain't here.

34:50.542 --> 34:53.375
- I kinda was wondering
that question, too,

34:53.375 --> 34:55.584
but, Mia, you just
met this lady.

34:55.584 --> 34:57.334
- I'm not mad at Mia.

34:57.334 --> 34:58.918
Mia, go on and get
them answers, honey,

34:58.918 --> 35:00.751
and tell me
all about it.

35:00.751 --> 35:04.334
- I don't think Mia has
met rat-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta

35:04.334 --> 35:07.626
Candiace, so I would tell
her to tread lightly.

35:07.626 --> 35:09.751
- What color is your car?
- My car is black,

35:09.751 --> 35:11.584
but my car is
not that model.

35:11.584 --> 35:15.042
- Mia, what color
car does Mia have?

35:15.042 --> 35:17.209
What?
- I'm just-- Mia is over

35:17.209 --> 35:22.292
there asking your mama
if Chris is gettin' paid.

35:22.292 --> 35:26.167
- Is she?
- Mm-hmm.

35:26.167 --> 35:27.959
- Just because your husband
came and got you

35:27.959 --> 35:30.834
off the curb and is
paying you a salary

35:30.834 --> 35:33.417
to be his trophy wife
with the bubble lips

35:33.417 --> 35:35.417
and the big feet
does not mean

35:35.417 --> 35:37.292
that you can
come up in my business.

35:37.292 --> 35:40.292
I don't have time for this.
Good night.

35:40.292 --> 35:41.751
- Yes, you can.
- Okay, perfect.

35:41.751 --> 35:44.459
- For Candiace, absolutely.
- Perfect, okay.

35:44.459 --> 35:47.083
- What is goin' on?
- I don't-- I don't know.

35:47.083 --> 35:48.083
Somethin' with the cars.

35:48.083 --> 35:50.292
- Do you want me to line
up with this Maserati?

35:50.292 --> 35:53.667
- No, uh, the same line,

35:53.667 --> 35:54.918
but I need you back
right here, though.

35:54.918 --> 35:56.000
- Chris is on his way.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.918
Is there anything
you need from Chris?

35:57.918 --> 36:03.792
- Just for him
to be here.

36:03.792 --> 36:05.834
- No, no, no.

36:05.834 --> 36:15.083
- He quit?

36:15.083 --> 36:16.959
- This is

36:16.959 --> 36:18.125
