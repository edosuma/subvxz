WEBVTT

00:10.162 --> 00:11.880
But the good news is
I think it's gonna be between us.

00:11.999 --> 00:13.543
Bad news is the best
man is gonna win.

00:13.695 --> 00:15.503
You can't even watch
them for a second!

00:15.591 --> 00:17.119
It's like... Leaving
them with nobody!

00:17.224 --> 00:18.384
Because you're so good with them.

00:18.672 --> 00:19.479
What does your husband do?

00:19.586 --> 00:21.104
I'm not married.

00:21.279 --> 00:22.872
Don is important.

00:23.031 --> 00:24.264
You know, I found that guy.

00:25.520 --> 00:26.455
I'm gonna hard on you,

00:26.527 --> 00:28.271
only because I think
I see you as an

00:28.384 --> 00:29.544
extension of myself.

"Greyhound. The cure
for the common bus."

01:11.210 --> 01:13.945
"Lay-z-boy. The cure
for the common chair."

01:15.815 --> 01:18.049
"Budweiser. The cure
for the common beer."

01:19.452 --> 01:20.885
"Manufacturers Hanover bank.

01:20.953 --> 01:24.389
The cure for the common... Bank."

01:26.292 --> 01:28.526
How about "Alka-seltzer.
The cure for the common cold"?

01:28.594 --> 01:30.629
"The cure for the common cold"

01:30.696 --> 01:32.864
is the idiom I'm playing off.

01:32.932 --> 01:35.267
It's an idiom.
Did you know that?

01:37.436 --> 01:40.639
So other than your summer
internship at Needham,

01:40.706 --> 01:42.474
do you have any actual
advertising experience?

01:42.541 --> 01:44.909
The cure for the common chair.

01:44.977 --> 01:46.511
That's Roger's favorite.

01:46.579 --> 01:48.480
Roger Sterling.

01:48.547 --> 01:51.016
He's the guy I shook hands with
when I came in.

01:51.083 --> 01:53.485
What did Roger think of this ad?

01:53.552 --> 01:55.620
What, are you kidding me?
Everybody loves that.

01:55.688 --> 01:57.822
It's the opposite
of what you expect.

01:57.890 --> 01:59.391
That's what I'm interested in.

01:59.458 --> 02:01.359
Why is it in your book?

02:01.427 --> 02:02.627
I've got a bunch of them in there...

02:02.695 --> 02:03.928
Marlboro man, Maidenform.

02:03.996 --> 02:06.731
I like to put in work
that I admire.

02:06.799 --> 02:09.067
Don't you ever tear things
out of magazines?

02:09.134 --> 02:12.637
Yes, but I don't
put them in my book.

02:12.705 --> 02:15.707
Well, you know what they say:

02:15.775 --> 02:18.376
"Aspiration's as good
as perspiration."

02:18.444 --> 02:20.078
That's not how it goes.

02:22.481 --> 02:24.149
Look,

02:24.216 --> 02:26.318
I'm a 24-year-old kid.

02:26.385 --> 02:29.521
I want to be in the ad game.

02:29.588 --> 02:32.390
I know I've got a lot to learn,
but I'm a hard worker.

02:32.458 --> 02:34.826
I'd sweep up the floors around here.

02:34.894 --> 02:36.728
I don't know if Roger told you that.

02:36.796 --> 02:38.196
He did talk to you, didn't he?

02:38.264 --> 02:39.864
He did.

02:41.534 --> 02:43.735
It was really a pleasure
to meet you, Danny.

02:46.639 --> 02:50.642
- I wish you the best of luck.
- Best of luck in... In what?

02:50.710 --> 02:53.378
- What do you mean?
- You trailed off.

02:53.446 --> 02:54.779
We'll let you know.

02:54.847 --> 02:56.815
Do you know a good place
to eat around here?

02:59.585 --> 03:01.553
Tell my secretary you're hungry

03:01.620 --> 03:04.222
and see what she suggests.

03:12.598 --> 03:14.165
Are we on "Candid camera"?

03:15.735 --> 03:17.469
I don't want to jump
on his grave or anything,

03:17.536 --> 03:19.904
but there's no way he's 24.

03:19.972 --> 03:22.507
I'm 25.

03:23.976 --> 03:25.510
What's his connection to Roger?

03:25.578 --> 03:27.579
Besides being delusional?

03:27.646 --> 03:29.581
He's Jane Seigel's cousin.

03:31.217 --> 03:33.184
It's a relief to see

03:33.252 --> 03:35.954
someone worse than me
and really know it.

03:36.021 --> 03:38.089
Don't get used to it.

03:39.525 --> 03:41.860
Well, you know,
I look at Glo-coat

03:41.927 --> 03:44.062
and see how far
everything's come...

03:44.130 --> 03:45.830
You know, my work.

03:45.898 --> 03:47.832
Glo-coat.

03:47.900 --> 03:50.502
You finish something,
you find out everyone loves it

03:50.569 --> 03:52.103
right around the time that

03:52.171 --> 03:53.671
it feels like someone else did it.

03:56.375 --> 03:57.942
Is that your speech for the Clios?

03:58.010 --> 03:59.344
They don't have speeches.

03:59.412 --> 04:01.713
We're going to win.

04:01.781 --> 04:03.148
Just because it got nominated

04:03.215 --> 04:04.682
doesn't mean they're going
to give me an award.

04:04.750 --> 04:06.217
Aren't you excited?

04:06.285 --> 04:07.919
I try not to think about it.

04:07.987 --> 04:09.654
Then you must be excited.

04:09.722 --> 04:12.490
Well, it'd be good for the agency.

04:12.558 --> 04:16.628
Grey doubled their value in five years
and it was all based on awards.

04:18.096 --> 04:19.930
You got anything on Vicks?

04:19.999 --> 04:23.101
- Actually, it's Vick chemical.
- Answer the question.

04:23.169 --> 04:25.403
We're very behind.

04:25.471 --> 04:28.473
Your new art director has been
waiting for synchronicity,

04:28.541 --> 04:30.942
which involves me coming up
with a bunch of ideas,

04:31.010 --> 04:34.446
chasing him down and having him
draw all of them and lose them.

04:34.513 --> 04:37.248
He's your new art director too,
and you have a deadline.

04:37.316 --> 04:39.951
And don't think you can spend
Monday hiding behind corners

04:40.019 --> 04:43.054
and trying not to make eye contact.
I will find you.

04:43.122 --> 04:45.790
- I'm not the problem.
- You are,

04:45.858 --> 04:49.093
because Stan is talented
and more experienced.

04:49.161 --> 04:52.096
You need to learn how to work
with him, not the other way around.

04:56.168 --> 04:57.602
Well, good luck this afternoon.

04:57.670 --> 04:59.671
You're not supposed to say that.

04:59.738 --> 05:02.073
Oh. Well, break a leg.

05:05.544 --> 05:07.579
Charlie Chaplin was very lonely.

05:07.646 --> 05:10.181
That tramp...
Too much of a sad sack.

05:10.249 --> 05:12.317
Laurel and Hardy...
They were better,

05:12.384 --> 05:15.320
except Hardy was so mean to Laurel.
I hated that.

05:17.089 --> 05:19.491
Why am I talking
about silent movies?

05:19.558 --> 05:24.128
I suppose as part of the chapter
on your childhood?

05:24.196 --> 05:26.197
That part of my book is
getting bigger and bigger.

05:26.265 --> 05:28.366
Why is that?

05:28.434 --> 05:29.767
Who is it?

05:32.104 --> 05:33.671
I thought I should come in
and tell you this in person.

05:33.739 --> 05:35.573
That kid...
A very very cute prank.

05:35.641 --> 05:37.575
Caroline... To be continued.

05:37.643 --> 05:39.644
That's a good idea.

05:39.712 --> 05:41.012
I've been to the Clios before.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.814
We're gonna want
to show up prepared.

05:42.882 --> 05:45.617
His book...

05:45.684 --> 05:48.486
...It was filled with old ads.

05:48.554 --> 05:50.388
Plagiarism... That's resourceful.

05:50.456 --> 05:52.857
He had five originals...

05:52.925 --> 05:55.793
- They were all the same thing.
- I told him to be himself.

05:55.861 --> 05:58.129
That was pretty mean, I guess.

05:59.732 --> 06:02.367
- So when does he start?
- The first of never.

06:03.903 --> 06:05.603
Well, you haven't
been married for a while,

06:05.671 --> 06:07.338
so you've probably forgotten
how these transactions work.

06:07.406 --> 06:09.173
If I don't hire Jane's cousin,

06:09.241 --> 06:11.409
it's probably going to cost me
a personal gift expenditure

06:11.477 --> 06:13.845
of between $500 and $1,000.

06:13.913 --> 06:16.147
- When are we leaving?
- Right after life cereal.

06:16.215 --> 06:17.715
To new business...

06:19.451 --> 06:21.185
And victory at the Waldorf.

06:21.253 --> 06:22.387
I mean it. You deserve it.

06:24.790 --> 06:27.292
So I can show you what's popular,
what's unique,

06:27.359 --> 06:29.060
and the only thing I ask
is that you call me Don.

06:29.128 --> 06:32.230
Well, Don, I can't say
I know my furs that well.

06:32.298 --> 06:34.098
I know my mother had
a chinchilla...

06:34.166 --> 06:36.801
I was always on the verge
of a romantic relationship with it.

06:36.869 --> 06:39.637
- Is this for your mother?
- I bet you never hear that.

06:39.705 --> 06:43.141
I don't. Would you like
to give me a price range?

06:43.208 --> 06:46.344
Well, that's an interesting question.
I have a unique problem.

06:46.412 --> 06:49.013
I need to spend a lot but
be careful not to spend too much.

06:49.081 --> 06:51.849
Not a unique problem.
I don't want to be forward,

06:51.917 --> 06:53.885
but can I assume this is
some kind of an apology?

06:53.953 --> 06:56.321
No no no, I know exactly
how much that costs.

06:56.388 --> 06:59.157
This is "I'm getting to know you,
but I don't want to scare you."

06:59.224 --> 07:00.658
I know what we're gonna do.

07:00.726 --> 07:02.694
So now it's "we"?

07:05.931 --> 07:07.565
It's always the right size

07:07.633 --> 07:10.134
and nothing says mink like mink.

07:10.202 --> 07:12.403
It's a nice way to ease into things

07:12.471 --> 07:14.305
and you can always come back
for the rest of it.

07:14.373 --> 07:16.307
How about we split the difference
so they wear them to their waist?

07:16.375 --> 07:18.076
It's the most popular this year.

07:21.146 --> 07:23.615
"Why wait for a man
to buy you a fur coat?"

07:25.317 --> 07:28.186
That's a dumb question.
Who does your work?

07:28.253 --> 07:29.954
- I do.
- Really?

07:30.022 --> 07:33.191
Yeah. It's an interest of mine
and they let me do it.

07:36.295 --> 07:38.796
Look at that.
Can I give you a call?

07:38.864 --> 07:41.833
First of all, you need 20 of those.

07:41.900 --> 07:43.801
And second of all, no.

07:43.869 --> 07:46.004
I just want you to call that number

07:46.071 --> 07:47.639
so I can give you some
very specific delivery instructions.

07:49.208 --> 07:50.508
Of course, Mr. Sterling.

07:52.344 --> 07:54.045
So what do I owe you?

07:54.113 --> 07:57.015
I saw you leave the office
with something under your arm.

07:57.082 --> 08:00.051
You don't know what it is.

08:00.119 --> 08:02.520
The guy in the elevator
thought it was a hydrogen bomb.

08:02.588 --> 08:05.690
- It's a beautiful box.
- Mm-hmm.

08:05.758 --> 08:07.692
Skip the radio play. Open it.

08:12.798 --> 08:17.168
Oh, Roger, you shouldn't have.

08:17.236 --> 08:18.970
You like it?

08:19.038 --> 08:20.838
I don't know what to say.

08:20.906 --> 08:21.973
Try it on.

08:24.276 --> 08:26.077
But first take off the dress.

08:26.145 --> 08:28.513
One gift at a time.

08:30.649 --> 08:32.717
What is this, an owner's manual?

08:36.955 --> 08:38.756
It's Noah's ark.

08:42.061 --> 08:43.461
It's out of line is what it is.

08:46.365 --> 08:47.398
So?

08:50.002 --> 08:52.804
I love it. It's perfect.

08:52.871 --> 08:55.707
And I think it's a bit much.

08:55.774 --> 08:58.576
If you don't kiss me after that,
I'm gonna believe you.

09:07.152 --> 09:10.288
When I wear it, I'll think of everything
that happened the night I got it.

09:20.199 --> 09:22.567
Caroline!

09:22.634 --> 09:25.169
Get in here. I think I finally
have a work story.

09:28.173 --> 09:30.975
Joan! What's keeping them?

09:31.043 --> 09:34.479
Life.

09:34.546 --> 09:36.647
When do you have to
leave for the clios?

09:36.715 --> 09:37.982
I was late for
the Emmys last year.

09:38.050 --> 09:40.084
Red Skelton gave my seat away.

09:40.152 --> 09:42.286
I would surmise, due to the usual
nature of your stories,

09:42.354 --> 09:44.088
that that's someone of note.

09:45.724 --> 09:48.359
The good news is our friends
at the cereal company

09:48.427 --> 09:50.161
have been grounded
in Philly due to wind.

09:50.229 --> 09:52.930
- What's good about that?
- And the bad news is...

09:55.667 --> 09:57.769
We only have an hour before
we're due at the Clios.

09:57.836 --> 10:01.205
Sorry, kids.
Game called on account of wind.

10:01.273 --> 10:03.474
Well, if it's all about a sendoff,
I'll have a 7&7.

10:03.542 --> 10:06.410
You have legs. Don?

10:06.478 --> 10:08.646
Make it simple but significant.

10:08.714 --> 10:11.082
It's Friday.

10:11.150 --> 10:13.050
For all we know, they're going to
turn around and go home

10:13.118 --> 10:16.387
- and we'll have to reschedule.
- Is Joan going with you?

10:16.455 --> 10:19.323
Yes. We only had four tickets.

10:19.391 --> 10:20.925
There'll be a lot of other
people's clients there.

10:22.828 --> 10:24.595
- Thank you, Joan.
- Peggy, anything?

10:24.663 --> 10:26.464
I have work to do.

10:30.903 --> 10:33.471
"We represent the majority
of the people in Alabama

10:33.539 --> 10:35.940
who hate niggerism, catholicism,

10:36.008 --> 10:38.509
judaism and all the isms
in the whole world."

10:38.577 --> 10:41.212
So said Robert Creel
of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.747
Somebody got it to Goldwater.

10:42.815 --> 10:44.916
Apparently he pissed blood.

10:44.983 --> 10:46.450
"...Needs our help."

10:49.488 --> 10:51.989
This again? Really?

10:52.057 --> 10:54.625
Clara asked.

10:54.693 --> 10:56.694
Clara asked to see your reel?

10:56.762 --> 10:59.430
I just wanted to see that Klan one.

10:59.498 --> 11:02.934
- He said it never aired.
- Which makes it less impressive, Clara.

11:03.001 --> 11:04.335
Girls, do you mind?

11:20.385 --> 11:23.721
Well, all the girls are gone.
What do you want?

11:23.789 --> 11:25.890
Are you going to use the K.K.K.
to sell cough drops?

11:25.958 --> 11:27.358
It's better than waiting on you

11:27.426 --> 11:29.126
to bring me something
that'll get my juices flowing.

11:29.194 --> 11:32.296
Should I get Megan back in here?
Maybe she's not repressed.

11:32.364 --> 11:36.200
Why's it so hard for you to accept
that man's natural state is nude?

11:36.268 --> 11:38.736
- Because I'm civilized.
- Because you're brainwashed

11:38.804 --> 11:41.172
by society into thinking it's dirty.

11:41.240 --> 11:44.041
You take away all this crap
and you'd see it's not.

11:44.109 --> 11:46.010
It's natural and it's beautiful.

11:46.078 --> 11:48.212
Have you been yelled at
by Don yet?

11:48.280 --> 11:51.415
- I'm not scared of him.
- So that's a no.

11:51.483 --> 11:53.384
He said Monday...
And I'm not working this weekend.

11:53.452 --> 11:56.587
Okay okay. Jesus.
Are you on the rag?

11:58.390 --> 12:00.024
It'll get done. Let's go.

12:03.862 --> 12:06.731
Well, I'd say you're lucky
the Glo-coat brass isn't here.

12:06.798 --> 12:09.367
The minute you win they know
the ad's arty, then you're out of business.

12:09.434 --> 12:11.702
Turns out there's almost 50 awards.

12:11.770 --> 12:14.171
Let's say 10 minutes a piece, it's...

12:14.239 --> 12:15.573
Holy crap.

12:15.641 --> 12:17.541
Roger, you remember
Ned Elliot from K&E.

12:17.609 --> 12:19.010
Of course. What are you in for?

12:19.077 --> 12:20.778
New England Merchants Bank,

12:20.846 --> 12:22.613
best local under $2,000.

12:22.681 --> 12:24.982
Stop bragging, will you?

12:25.050 --> 12:26.684
Good luck, Don.

12:29.855 --> 12:32.223
Well well, if it isn't
Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm.

12:32.291 --> 12:34.625
Leave any drinks
for the rest of us?

12:34.693 --> 12:37.695
Don Draper, Roger Sterling,
this is major-general Frank Alvin.

12:39.698 --> 12:41.699
Roger, have you had the pleasure
of meeting Ted Chaough?

12:41.767 --> 12:44.902
Is that how you say it?
C-h-a-o-u-g-h?

12:44.970 --> 12:46.904
Hey, writers, how many
extra vowels is that?

12:48.240 --> 12:49.974
Let's head due south, General.

12:50.042 --> 12:51.842
Well, I hope this doesn't
drag on like last year.

12:51.910 --> 12:53.577
Oh, wait. You weren't here.

12:57.716 --> 12:59.750
General Rufus T. Bullshit.

12:59.818 --> 13:01.852
I've met that guy before.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.689
- In the war?
- No, in a commercial for Bay rum.

13:04.756 --> 13:07.591
Chao-guh-guh hired
an actor to impress someone.

13:07.659 --> 13:09.460
Last time I saw the General,
he had a parrot on his shoulder.

13:11.830 --> 13:14.231
That was not a business proposition.

13:14.299 --> 13:16.968
You catch more flies with honey.

13:17.035 --> 13:20.471
Oh, great...
Actual flies.

13:22.674 --> 13:24.642
Phillip, how are you?

13:24.710 --> 13:26.944
- You remember Joan Harris.
- Nice to see you.

13:27.012 --> 13:28.679
Mr. Cosgrove,
nice to see you again.

13:28.747 --> 13:30.414
I'm surprised he would
bring you over here.

13:30.482 --> 13:32.416
You know, we miss birds-eye
more than we miss Kenny.

13:32.484 --> 13:35.052
Well, that's why
I wanted to say hello.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.687
I hear the old team's
getting back together.

13:36.755 --> 13:38.322
What team?

13:38.390 --> 13:41.525
Uh, Phil, that's not a sure thing.

13:43.762 --> 13:47.598
Well, I'll say this about Guyer...

13:47.666 --> 13:49.900
- They don't have Don.
- Take your seats, please.

13:49.968 --> 13:52.636
Well, we should sit down. Good luck.

13:55.474 --> 13:57.908
Judas priest.
Are we merging with Guyer?

13:57.976 --> 13:59.677
Talk to Lane.

14:02.848 --> 14:07.184
Welcome to the sixth annual
American television commercials awards.

14:07.252 --> 14:10.654
We're here to honor
creative excellence

14:10.722 --> 14:12.089
in advertising and design...

14:12.157 --> 14:15.159
I just ran into Ken Cosgrove.

14:15.227 --> 14:17.395
Don't talk to me right now.

14:17.462 --> 14:19.830
And I do mean everything.

14:23.268 --> 14:25.536
I don't know if it was
that funny, but thank you.

14:25.604 --> 14:29.140
I have to tell you I am very
impressed you got this gig.

14:29.207 --> 14:32.910
Yes. Well, thank you
for making it easier.

14:32.978 --> 14:34.812
Wally, it's me.

14:37.582 --> 14:39.950
You know, when I was
coming up at Y&R,

14:40.018 --> 14:43.020
you were very inspiring.

14:43.088 --> 14:45.656
Raymond Rubicam said
you were a genius.

14:45.724 --> 14:47.591
Great to see you...

14:47.659 --> 14:49.860
I mean, actually alive and everything.

14:49.928 --> 14:52.797
Get your hands off me.

14:52.864 --> 14:55.433
What's with the French service?

14:55.500 --> 14:57.501
God, I miss working with that guy.

14:57.569 --> 15:00.471
I feel like I've already won.

15:00.539 --> 15:01.772
Well, I'm afraid that'll be the limit

15:01.840 --> 15:04.108
to the public speaking
portion of our show.

15:05.744 --> 15:08.212
And, gentlemen,
let's pace ourselves.

15:10.782 --> 15:13.284
In the first category...
That of apparel...

15:13.351 --> 15:15.019
The nominees are...

15:18.723 --> 15:20.658
Hey, that's five.

15:20.725 --> 15:22.726
If you really worked
on the Johnson campaign,

15:22.794 --> 15:25.029
- why are you here?
- Because nobody at D.D.B.

15:25.097 --> 15:27.098
Even keeps track
of who does what...

15:27.165 --> 15:30.801
Except "the Daisy ad". Big deal.

15:30.869 --> 15:33.704
The Klan is probably the best thing
I'll be near my entire life.

15:33.772 --> 15:35.673
Well, let me tell you...

15:35.740 --> 15:37.241
I had a lot to do with Glo-coat...

15:37.309 --> 15:39.910
A lot... The idea especially.

15:39.978 --> 15:42.146
The kid?

15:42.214 --> 15:44.748
Don put the whole
cowboy thing on it.

15:44.816 --> 15:46.684
I don't know if it was
that revolutionary.

15:46.751 --> 15:50.554
It was jarring,
but more cute than I like.

15:50.622 --> 15:52.523
I know I'm not supposed to go,

15:52.591 --> 15:55.559
but when the nomination came in,

15:55.627 --> 15:57.761
Don let everybody
pat him on the back.

15:57.829 --> 16:00.231
He didn't even look at me

16:00.298 --> 16:02.099
and I was... I was right there.

16:04.002 --> 16:06.604
I was clapping and he thought
I was clapping for him.

16:06.671 --> 16:08.472
Who claps for themselves?

16:11.109 --> 16:15.079
Okay, I'm gonna riff
for a few minutes

16:15.147 --> 16:19.517
and just sorta speechatize
the whole Vicks experience.

16:19.584 --> 16:21.185
Should I come back
when you're through?

16:21.253 --> 16:23.287
No, toots, grab a pencil.

16:23.355 --> 16:25.389
Someone's gonna want
to get it down

16:25.457 --> 16:27.291
before it heads
into the stratosphere.

16:27.359 --> 16:29.193
Why don't you
write down my ideas?

16:29.261 --> 16:30.861
Look, I read your brochure.

16:30.929 --> 16:33.197
I have no interest
in the temperance movement.

16:36.268 --> 16:38.135
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

16:46.444 --> 16:49.813
And now for best cleansers,
waxes and polishes.

16:49.881 --> 16:52.750
- This is us.
- Glass wax spray's

16:52.817 --> 16:56.587
"gobbles up dirt,"
Campbell Mithun of Minneapolis.

16:56.655 --> 16:58.389
How do I look?

16:58.456 --> 17:00.724
- Great.
- One step floor care's

17:00.792 --> 17:03.661
"bus stop," B.B.D.O.;

17:03.728 --> 17:06.329
Glo-coat,  "Billy the kid,"

17:06.397 --> 17:08.933
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce;

17:09.000 --> 17:12.803
and pledge, "Runaway chair,"
Benton & Bowles.

17:14.973 --> 17:17.575
And the winner is...

17:17.642 --> 17:19.510
Glo-coat, "Billy the kid"...

17:21.445 --> 17:23.113
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.

17:31.056 --> 17:32.923
- Congratulations, Don.
- Thank you.

17:52.110 --> 17:54.178
- Next up, competing in...
- Let me see it.

17:54.246 --> 17:56.880
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

17:56.948 --> 17:59.049
- What's going on, dear?
- Well, I ran over

17:59.117 --> 18:01.318
because the people from
life cereal rented a car

18:01.386 --> 18:03.087
and now they're waiting
at the office.

18:03.154 --> 18:05.356
- Right now?
- We'll reschedule.

18:05.423 --> 18:07.191
Maybe I can convince them
to stay for the weekend.

18:07.259 --> 18:09.560
No no, they want
to see our presentation.

18:09.628 --> 18:11.662
What do you say we put
a cherry on this thing?

18:11.730 --> 18:14.064
- Aye aye, sir.
- Really?

18:18.242 --> 18:19.976
So the Schusters move into what
used to be the Harrington House.

18:20.043 --> 18:22.278
Meanwhile, Betty gets
extremely jealous

18:22.346 --> 18:24.680
when she sees Allison dancing
with Rodney at the after-party.

18:24.748 --> 18:26.749
But then Michael asked
Betty to dance with him

18:26.817 --> 18:28.584
and also dances with Claire

18:28.652 --> 18:31.854
and that is all I can tell you about
the next few weeks of "Peyton place."

18:31.922 --> 18:33.489
How the heck do
you know all this?

18:33.557 --> 18:35.224
They send me the scripts.

18:35.292 --> 18:37.727
I need to see them. It's my job.

18:37.795 --> 18:39.762
I can't believe Connie goes
through with their wedding.

18:39.830 --> 18:42.031
It is a surprise. I agree.

18:47.971 --> 18:49.739
What more do I need to say?

18:49.807 --> 18:52.375
- It's heavy.
- Don, you remember...

18:52.442 --> 18:54.510
Jim and Dennis,
glad you could make it.

18:54.578 --> 18:56.679
I can't thank you
enough for waiting.

18:56.747 --> 18:59.482
Oh, don't think about it.
I've been unwinding

18:59.550 --> 19:01.784
as Mr. Crane ruins
"Peyton place" for us.

19:01.852 --> 19:04.487
Perfect. Let's get to it.

19:04.555 --> 19:06.722
- Roger, thank you.
- I'll be on my way,

19:06.790 --> 19:09.058
but first... Victory lap!

19:09.126 --> 19:11.327
Come on, Don, Pete,
Crane, Jimmy Olsen!

19:18.669 --> 19:20.970
Wrap it up quickly, gents.
We have an after-party to attend.

19:21.038 --> 19:22.738
Thank you, Roger.

19:22.806 --> 19:24.307
Is everyone set?

19:24.374 --> 19:26.209
That's one word for it.

19:26.276 --> 19:28.144
Joey, you didn't start
without me, did you?

19:28.212 --> 19:29.812
No, Don. I would not do that.

19:29.880 --> 19:32.348
Okay, everybody ready?

19:33.951 --> 19:35.651
So...

19:36.987 --> 19:40.256
Life cereal... Delicious, crispy

19:40.324 --> 19:41.691
and it's got a big name, you know.

19:41.758 --> 19:43.192
And I know you want
to associate it with health,

19:43.260 --> 19:44.694
but that's not fun. Joey?

19:45.996 --> 19:47.597
Ah. You know what?
I've got it.

19:49.867 --> 19:52.235
Look, there are
sweeter cereals than this,

19:52.302 --> 19:54.670
but I kept thinking about, you know,

19:54.738 --> 19:57.173
nostalgia.

19:57.241 --> 19:59.242
How you remember
something in the past

19:59.309 --> 20:02.478
and it feels good,
but it's a little bit painful,

20:02.546 --> 20:04.380
like when you were a kid.

20:04.448 --> 20:05.982
- That's the truth.
- And "Life,"

20:06.049 --> 20:08.417
that's a scary word
to anyone at any age.

20:08.485 --> 20:09.385
So how do we make it fun?

20:12.756 --> 20:14.590
"Eat life by the bowlful."

20:14.658 --> 20:16.859
A little kid, big bowl, big spoon.

20:16.927 --> 20:19.729
Kids see the giant bowl
of cereal and they smile

20:19.796 --> 20:22.298
because, you know, they'd eat
a box of it if they could.

20:22.366 --> 20:24.433
And moms see it
and they get this twinge

20:24.501 --> 20:25.835
of how little their kid still is

20:25.903 --> 20:27.970
even though they have
to deal with life.

20:28.038 --> 20:29.839
Get those two together
in a market

20:29.907 --> 20:31.140
and I think we're going
to sell some cereal.

20:32.442 --> 20:34.243
That's all I have.

20:34.311 --> 20:36.679
I think if you'd invite us into the rest
of your company,

20:36.747 --> 20:38.447
we could build
a Saturday morning tv show

20:38.515 --> 20:39.949
around the whole
Quaker oats family.

20:40.017 --> 20:41.951
In fact, it could be called
the "Quaker oats family."

20:42.019 --> 20:45.121
I like the bowlful,

20:45.188 --> 20:48.357
but I think it's kinda smart
for regular folks, you know?

20:48.425 --> 20:51.294
- The irony, I guess.
- Children look at the picture.

20:51.361 --> 20:53.496
Moms look at the irony.

20:53.563 --> 20:56.098
Yeah, but when
I go back to Chicago,

20:56.166 --> 20:58.267
all they're gonna wanna hear
is a slogan,

20:58.335 --> 21:00.903
and I don't think this is gonna cut it.

21:00.971 --> 21:04.040
Well, why don't we let
Don work that over?

21:04.107 --> 21:06.108
We can either talk on Monday
if you're staying the weekend

21:06.176 --> 21:07.376
or we can come
see you in Chicago.

21:07.444 --> 21:08.577
I've got it. I've got it, Pete.

21:11.581 --> 21:13.582
How about...

21:13.650 --> 21:15.751
"Life is just a bowl of life cereal"?

21:18.722 --> 21:20.156
"Life is sweet."

21:21.591 --> 21:23.659
Uh...

21:23.727 --> 21:26.095
"Enjoy the rest of your life... Cereal"

21:26.163 --> 21:28.464
Don, they're not expecting
you to do this right now.

21:28.532 --> 21:30.499
Give me a second.

21:30.567 --> 21:33.202
"Life. The reason to get
out of bed in the morning."

21:33.270 --> 21:35.972
"Life. The cure
for the common breakfast."

21:36.039 --> 21:38.407
"Life. It's sweetness
never ends."

21:38.475 --> 21:41.577
- "Life. Eat it by the bowlful."
- Oh oh. There you go.

21:41.645 --> 21:44.714
"The cure for the common breakfast."

21:44.781 --> 21:47.683
- Love it.
- It's got the health angle.

21:47.751 --> 21:49.685
Life makes you feel better.

21:49.753 --> 21:52.388
It's got protein.
Very nice.

21:52.456 --> 21:55.658
- That dog will hunt.
- Wonderful.

21:55.726 --> 21:58.494
- We'll get that put together for you.
- Should we discuss media?

21:58.562 --> 22:01.297
- I can keep going.
-  think we've got a home run.

22:01.365 --> 22:04.734
We don't need to take up
any more of your time.

22:04.801 --> 22:07.203
I know you have
some celebrating to do.

22:07.270 --> 22:10.673
I don't know what to say. This is
the most fun I've ever had in New York.

22:10.741 --> 22:15.111
- Anytime, fellas.
- Very good then.

22:15.178 --> 22:18.280
Roger, I'm done!

22:18.348 --> 22:20.583
- Let's go!
- Can I speak with you a moment?

22:20.650 --> 22:23.586
- Got anything on Vicks yet?
- I really need to talk to you.

22:23.653 --> 22:26.022
- You still have nothing?
- The tagline...

22:26.089 --> 22:27.690
Do you think I'm joking when
I give you a deadline?

22:27.758 --> 22:30.092
- You said Monday.
- Ida, book a nice room with a lock on it

22:30.160 --> 22:33.062
for misters Olsen and Rizzo.
Bill it to Vicks.

22:33.130 --> 22:34.964
- Don't come out until you have something.
- Are you kidding?

22:36.366 --> 22:38.567
Pete, we'll walk 'em out.

22:41.938 --> 22:44.673
Do you want to pick
a place or should I?

22:44.741 --> 22:47.376
He wasn't serious. It's the weekend.
We'll work in the office.

22:47.444 --> 22:50.346
Do you want me to go chase him
down to see if he's serious or not?

22:50.414 --> 22:52.348
Go get Stanley.

22:57.621 --> 22:59.889
- I need to speak with you.
- Not now.

22:59.956 --> 23:02.024
- Lane, may I?
- Come in.

23:07.330 --> 23:09.298
I'm only going to ask once:

23:09.366 --> 23:10.800
Are we merging with guyer?

23:10.867 --> 23:13.169
- No.
- Really?

23:13.236 --> 23:16.906
Well, I ran into Ken Cosgrove and
Clarence Birdseye at the Clios.

23:21.478 --> 23:25.081
It came to me that
Mr. Cosgrove was unhappy

23:25.148 --> 23:28.284
and that he and his choice clients

23:28.351 --> 23:30.686
would be a welcome
addition to the firm.

23:30.754 --> 23:32.021
Over my dead body.

23:37.627 --> 23:40.996
I apologize. It was wrong of me
not to consult you.

23:41.064 --> 23:43.466
- I wasn't sure...
- Wasn't sure about what?

23:43.533 --> 23:45.568
Whether to go behind my back?

23:45.635 --> 23:48.804
I'm a partner, damn it. I have
the same status here as you.

23:50.307 --> 23:52.208
You've never liked me.

23:52.275 --> 23:53.843
You picked him
over me to begin with

23:53.910 --> 23:55.744
and now you expect me
to work with him again?

23:55.812 --> 23:57.179
Approval denied.

24:00.750 --> 24:03.319
Roger Sterling is a child,

24:03.386 --> 24:05.354
and frankly

24:05.422 --> 24:08.090
we can't have you pulling
the cart all by yourself.

24:11.228 --> 24:13.295
Ken is proven,

24:13.363 --> 24:15.831
he's hungry,

24:15.899 --> 24:18.000
and he has accounts.

24:18.068 --> 24:21.403
Birds-eye, a beverage
called mountain dew

24:21.471 --> 24:22.771
and Fillmore auto parts,

24:22.839 --> 24:24.507
which has entered
the national arena.

24:24.574 --> 24:27.977
He would more
than pay for himself.

24:28.044 --> 24:29.745
Does that put you at ease?

24:29.813 --> 24:31.680
What would put me at ease

24:31.748 --> 24:34.316
is you and Madame Defarge
not plotting behind my back.

24:35.519 --> 24:37.853
Still, I expect pragmatism from you.

24:39.589 --> 24:41.123
We share that.

24:42.659 --> 24:45.261
Mr. Cosgrove and I are
having lunch on Monday.

24:45.328 --> 24:48.397
If your tantrum has subsided,

24:48.465 --> 24:50.900
you're welcome to join us.

24:53.003 --> 24:55.104
- I'm going home.
- And on a personal note,

24:55.172 --> 24:57.640
I'd like to add that
I'm quite fond of you.

24:57.707 --> 25:00.209
It pains me to hear
you say otherwise.

25:04.848 --> 25:07.850
- Get that thing in here.
- Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

25:11.755 --> 25:13.088
Mmm! General.

25:14.391 --> 25:16.458
You're not flying tonight, are you?

25:16.526 --> 25:18.127
No, it's been years.

25:18.195 --> 25:21.030
Ah. I bet. Name some aircraft for me.

25:21.097 --> 25:23.799
- No.
- No, wait. Who do you report to?

25:23.867 --> 25:26.902
- The President.
- Of what, William Morris?

25:26.970 --> 25:29.572
You know, one of these decorations

25:29.639 --> 25:31.907
is for shutting up loudmouths.

25:31.975 --> 25:34.109
It's a pleasure to meet you, General.
Enjoy your evening.

25:38.882 --> 25:41.717
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

25:41.785 --> 25:44.386
- You too.
- We're the top of the heap, huh?

25:44.454 --> 25:47.923
- The heap of what?
- I know they give out 50 a year,

25:47.991 --> 25:50.226
but I've gotta say it doesn't get
any sweeter than this.

25:51.728 --> 25:53.629
Roger, buy Ned a drink.

25:56.266 --> 25:58.334
There you are.

25:58.401 --> 26:01.170
Your mom called.
She's looking for us.

26:01.238 --> 26:04.106
It was very nice meeting you.

26:04.174 --> 26:06.108
- What are you doing?
- Rescuing you.

26:06.176 --> 26:09.411
From what, a business opportunity?

26:09.479 --> 26:11.914
Did you see the part
where I won?

26:11.982 --> 26:14.350
No, but I heard about it.

26:14.417 --> 26:17.586
They're gonna put your picture
on a dartboard at Grey.

26:17.654 --> 26:19.888
What is your problem?

26:19.956 --> 26:21.624
Grey won. Everybody won.

26:21.691 --> 26:23.659
That's not true.

26:23.727 --> 26:26.061
Just think how you'd feel
right now if you lost.

26:26.129 --> 26:28.631
About the same, I suppose.

26:28.698 --> 26:30.566
It doesn't make the work any better.

26:30.634 --> 26:33.469
That's very healthy.

26:33.536 --> 26:37.039
Award or no award,
you're still Don Draper.

26:37.107 --> 26:38.874
Whatever that means.

26:38.942 --> 26:42.077
You're incredible.

26:47.684 --> 26:49.251
You smell good.

26:49.319 --> 26:51.086
- Is that right?
- Uh-huh.

26:54.524 --> 26:56.392
What do you say we get out of here

26:56.459 --> 26:58.794
and really celebrate?

27:02.399 --> 27:05.267
I think you're confusing
a lot of things at once right now.

27:11.241 --> 27:13.342
I'm very happy for you.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.914
Are you calling
to give him an update?

27:29.982 --> 27:32.517
I'm calling him about something
completely unrelated to you.

27:32.585 --> 27:35.353
I know you have
a special relationship.

27:36.789 --> 27:39.257
- What does that mean?
- What?

27:39.325 --> 27:42.360
Not that. Jesus.
Of course not that.

27:42.428 --> 27:43.962
Do you think he'd be
caught dead with you?

27:44.030 --> 27:45.463
There's wallpaper more exciting.

27:45.531 --> 27:47.599
But I know you're his favorite.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.734
I bet he takes you hunting

27:49.802 --> 27:51.636
and lets you carry the carcasses
in your mouth.

27:53.906 --> 27:55.473
Are you gonna work
or just stare at pictures

27:55.541 --> 27:56.941
of women who can't stare back?

27:58.411 --> 28:00.311
You wouldn't understand,

28:00.379 --> 28:03.615
but this inspires me,

28:03.683 --> 28:06.618
opens my mind with freedom.

28:07.853 --> 28:10.021
So why aren't you a nudist?

28:10.089 --> 28:12.824
You talk about it all the time.

28:12.892 --> 28:16.094
Well, in a liberated
environment, I would be.

28:16.162 --> 28:18.530
In the presence of the Pope

28:18.597 --> 28:20.598
or say, you,

28:21.901 --> 28:24.135
it's difficult.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.137
You don't know anything about me.

28:26.205 --> 28:29.007
I know you're ashamed
of your body

28:29.075 --> 28:30.408
or you should be at least.

28:43.723 --> 28:46.658
- What are you doing?
- You're lazy.

28:46.726 --> 28:48.593
And you have no ideas.

28:51.197 --> 28:54.899
- Really?
- Yeah. Let's go.

28:57.336 --> 28:58.803
You're a fruitcake, you know that?

28:58.871 --> 29:00.905
And you're chickenshit.

29:00.973 --> 29:02.974
I can work like this.
Let's get liberated.

29:05.111 --> 29:06.311
Fantastic.

29:37.643 --> 29:38.877
What are you waiting for?

29:40.980 --> 29:41.646
Just...

29:46.552 --> 29:49.320
Let's talk cough drops.
Whatcha got?

29:49.388 --> 29:51.956
I'm thinking.

29:52.024 --> 29:53.758
About what?

29:53.826 --> 29:56.494
Don't flatter yourself.
It's involuntary.

29:56.562 --> 30:00.231
Maybe it was left over
from the magazine.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.967
Terrific.

30:03.035 --> 30:05.503
Now I don't think it's that
hard to convince people

30:05.571 --> 30:08.273
that cough drops are medicine,
especially when they taste like it, right?

30:20.853 --> 30:23.822
So you're really gonna leave me alone
with all these naked gold women?

30:23.889 --> 30:26.758
Excuse me. I hate to interrupt.

30:26.826 --> 30:29.327
- You're not interrupting.
- That man over there...

30:29.395 --> 30:31.729
I saw you talking before.

30:31.797 --> 30:34.499
- Is that Don Draper?
- Yes it is.

30:34.567 --> 30:37.769
- Is he attached?
- To that glass? Absolutely.

30:37.837 --> 30:39.871
No.

30:44.443 --> 30:46.778
He's pretty proud of himself.

30:46.846 --> 30:48.947
Well, it's a big day for him.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.548
It's a big day for all of us.

30:50.616 --> 30:54.118
Especially you, okay?

30:54.186 --> 30:57.622
Well, they don't seem
to give awards for what I do.

30:57.690 --> 30:59.657
And what is that?

31:01.327 --> 31:03.061
Find guys like him.

31:07.166 --> 31:10.068
You've crossed the border
from lubricated to morose.

31:11.770 --> 31:13.071
Good night.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.684
Mr. Sterling.

31:29.955 --> 31:32.223
- Do I know you?
- It's Don.

31:32.291 --> 31:35.693
Don Draper. Heller's luxury furs.

31:35.761 --> 31:37.562
Oh, the fur guy.

31:39.765 --> 31:41.466
- What are you doing here?
- I have a meeting in the building.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.268
I saw you standing here
and I thought I'd say hello.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.639
Really? Name one other
company in this building.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.810
I'm sorry. It's just...

31:52.878 --> 31:55.480
I've left some messages for you.

31:55.547 --> 31:58.383
And I've ignored them.
That's my message for you.

31:58.450 --> 32:00.652
I just wanted to know
what you thought of my portfolio.

32:00.719 --> 32:03.321
I threw it out
with the box from the coat.

32:03.389 --> 32:04.789
That was a bad idea.

32:06.892 --> 32:08.426
Maybe it was a bad idea,

32:08.494 --> 32:11.329
but weren't you trying
to get a break once?

32:16.468 --> 32:18.202
Where does your boss
think you are right now?

32:20.806 --> 32:22.440
He knows I want to do what you do.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.375
And what do you think that is?

32:24.443 --> 32:27.879
I think you're a very important man
in a very important agency.

32:27.947 --> 32:30.515
Maybe I am risking my job,

32:30.582 --> 32:33.284
but I'd do anything to buy you a drink

32:33.352 --> 32:34.519
and hear anything you have to say.

32:35.955 --> 32:37.388
It's 10:00 A.M.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.691
My mother always said

32:39.758 --> 32:41.993
"be careful what you wish for,
because you'll get it.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.662
And then people'll get jealous and
try to take it away from you."

32:46.031 --> 32:47.699
I don't think that's how that goes.

32:47.766 --> 32:50.301
You're an expert
on everything, right?

32:50.369 --> 32:52.971
And how can I hire you?
You know too much about me.

32:53.038 --> 32:54.839
You know I've been discreet.

32:54.907 --> 32:57.508
Once you say that,
you're not discreet anymore.

32:57.576 --> 33:00.411
I gotta get out of here before they
open for lunch. This is embarrassing.

33:01.714 --> 33:03.348
I'll buy you lunch.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.516
I'm stuffed. I had a jar of olives.

33:06.685 --> 33:09.620
Oh.

33:10.990 --> 33:12.991
And you're a great fur guy.

33:13.058 --> 33:14.392
I'm gonna need one of those.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.961
Let me get you a cab.

33:17.029 --> 33:19.163
You should go home.

33:20.432 --> 33:22.667
Garรงon! Je m'appelle Roger!

33:22.735 --> 33:24.302
Je suis un taxi, si vous plait!

33:31.810 --> 33:34.779
So you use cough drops
when you're sick in bed,

33:34.847 --> 33:37.081
on a car trip, at the movies

33:37.149 --> 33:38.983
and in church.

33:40.419 --> 33:41.586
Anything you'd like to add?

33:43.088 --> 33:45.723
- What?
- This pencil's a little dull.

33:47.659 --> 33:50.228
Maybe I should dip that thing
in some ink and write with it.

33:50.295 --> 33:53.564
- Stop looking.
- I thought it might make it go away.

34:06.812 --> 34:09.213
You know what? Fine.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.484
Are we getting dressed now?

34:13.552 --> 34:15.520
You can do whatever you want.

34:15.587 --> 34:18.723
- I don't care.
- But you do.

34:18.791 --> 34:22.025
- Fine, you win.
- Win what?

34:22.094 --> 34:25.730
Win the prize for the
smuggest bitch in the world.

34:25.797 --> 34:27.465
I need to take a leak.

34:39.344 --> 34:42.280
Hey, Rizzo!

34:42.347 --> 34:44.581
I'm hungry.
Do you want anything?

34:56.088 --> 34:57.455
What did you win for again?

34:59.157 --> 35:01.158
Cake mixes and toppings.

35:01.226 --> 35:03.427
I wrote the jingle.

35:03.495 --> 35:06.163
Oh. Can you hum a few bars?

35:23.248 --> 35:25.049
That sounds familiar.

35:28.353 --> 35:31.188
Oh. Okay.

35:52.777 --> 35:55.980
Hello.

35:56.047 --> 35:58.048
So you finally decided
to pick up the phone?

35:58.116 --> 36:00.384
- Where the hell are you?
- Who is this?

36:00.452 --> 36:03.387
It's me. Where the hell
are you? It's noon.

36:03.455 --> 36:06.457
You were supposed
to be here two hours ago.

36:06.525 --> 36:08.526
The kids are sitting
in the den watching tv,

36:08.593 --> 36:10.728
waiting for someone who
is obviously not coming.

36:10.795 --> 36:12.663
I know you don't care that Henry
and I were supposed to go

36:12.731 --> 36:14.665
to a very important brunch,

36:14.733 --> 36:16.534
but I can't get Carla anymore.
She's in church.

36:16.601 --> 36:19.370
- I'm coming on Sunday.
- It is Sunday!

36:24.709 --> 36:28.012
I'm really sorry, Betts.
I'm under the weather.

36:28.079 --> 36:30.047
Well, thank you for the notice, Don.
Thanks a lot.

36:32.984 --> 36:34.818
Is everything okay?

36:36.254 --> 36:38.322
Yeah.

36:38.390 --> 36:40.224
Everything's fine.

36:40.292 --> 36:42.059
Ah.

36:42.127 --> 36:44.595
I can't believe we slept so long.

36:44.663 --> 36:47.598
Mmm. Mmm.

36:49.100 --> 36:50.701
Is that yours?

36:51.903 --> 36:53.837
No, it's yours.

36:59.110 --> 37:01.245
I'm...

37:01.313 --> 37:03.280
Really sorry.

37:03.348 --> 37:07.084
I have some things to do.
I forgot about them.

37:07.152 --> 37:09.687
You said you were gonna take
my picture and you never did.

37:11.256 --> 37:14.491
- When did I say that?
- I don't know.

37:14.559 --> 37:17.628
Somewhere around
your third order of French fries

37:17.696 --> 37:19.163
after your sister left.

37:19.231 --> 37:20.864
My sister?

37:22.601 --> 37:24.702
Was that her on the phone?

37:24.769 --> 37:27.504
- No.
- Don't lie to me. It's okay, Dick.

37:29.507 --> 37:31.842
Listen, I don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

37:38.049 --> 37:39.883
Look,

37:41.186 --> 37:43.454
I'm really late.

37:43.521 --> 37:46.757
- I should get ready.
- Oh, okay.

37:48.426 --> 37:50.394
Uh, do you mind?

37:57.168 --> 37:58.969
I had a great time, Doris.

38:00.772 --> 38:02.973
I'm really sorry I forgot I had plans.

38:25.196 --> 38:26.730
All right.

38:26.798 --> 38:28.632
I'll see you around, I guess.

39:19.617 --> 39:21.652
Are you okay?

39:21.720 --> 39:23.954
I tried to call you Friday night,

39:24.022 --> 39:26.423
yesterday it rang and rang
and today it's busy.

39:26.491 --> 39:28.392
My phone's not working.

39:29.561 --> 39:30.861
Can I come in?

39:38.703 --> 39:40.604
What's the problem?

39:40.672 --> 39:42.873
Uh...

39:42.941 --> 39:44.608
I know you don't want to hear this,

39:44.676 --> 39:47.411
but the life cereal tag you sold,

39:47.479 --> 39:49.747
it was that kid's... Roger's idiot.

39:52.851 --> 39:55.786
"Eat life by the bowlful"?
We worked on that for weeks.

39:55.854 --> 39:58.722
No, "the cure for
the common breakfast."

39:58.790 --> 39:59.990
You changed it in the meeting.

40:00.058 --> 40:02.459
I don't think so.

40:02.527 --> 40:05.028
I know I've gotten stuff
stuck in my brain before

40:05.096 --> 40:06.997
and you don't know where
it's coming from.

40:07.065 --> 40:08.966
It's that kid's.

40:09.033 --> 40:10.834
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

40:12.670 --> 40:15.172
Call Life and tell them it's terrible

40:15.240 --> 40:17.141
- and we changed our minds.
- They loved it.

40:17.208 --> 40:19.810
- It's terrible.
- Well, neither you nor the client was

40:19.878 --> 40:21.578
in a condition to notice.

40:24.382 --> 40:26.383
Think of ten more tags.

40:26.451 --> 40:29.453
No. I've been working
all weekend with that pig

40:29.521 --> 40:31.755
in that stupid hotel room.
I am tapped out.

40:31.823 --> 40:34.391
What hotel room?

40:37.462 --> 40:40.431
You have to bring
him in right away.

40:40.498 --> 40:43.066
Tomorrow. Fix it.

40:46.738 --> 40:48.105
Shit.

41:03.697 --> 41:06.299
Mr. Cosgrove is on his way over.

41:06.367 --> 41:07.800
I've added you to our reservation.

41:07.868 --> 41:09.369
No. When he gets here

41:09.436 --> 41:10.870
bring him to the conference room.

41:17.077 --> 41:19.679
And he's coughing and
everyone's staring at him,

41:19.747 --> 41:22.281
including the priest,
then he sucks on a vicks.

41:22.349 --> 41:24.317
- It's good.
- Mmm.

41:24.385 --> 41:26.886
- It's pretty much how I pitched it.
- That's true.

41:26.954 --> 41:28.655
I only changed one little thing.

41:36.764 --> 41:39.599
- Good morning.
- Call the Pen & Pencil,

41:39.667 --> 41:41.434
see if someone found my award.

41:41.502 --> 41:43.569
What's the category?

41:43.637 --> 41:46.806
Best actress. It's a Clio.

41:53.547 --> 41:57.617
Hey. They told me to wait here.

41:57.685 --> 41:59.385
Your little friend is waiting.

42:03.957 --> 42:05.258
Listen, Danny,

42:07.594 --> 42:10.329
I've been thinking about things and
there was a slogan in your book...

42:10.397 --> 42:13.599
"The cure for the common" something.

42:13.667 --> 42:15.401
Bus, beer, chair?
Which one?

42:15.469 --> 42:17.136
All of them.

42:17.204 --> 42:18.871
I'm gonna give you $50 for the idea.

42:18.939 --> 42:21.107
You liked it, huh?

42:21.175 --> 42:22.775
What did I just say?

42:24.044 --> 42:25.578
I'd like a job.

42:28.415 --> 42:31.350
Fine, $100. It'll be freelance work.
Do you know what that is?

42:31.418 --> 42:33.619
Yeah, it's not a job.

42:33.687 --> 42:36.089
I don't have to buy it.

42:36.156 --> 42:39.058
I could just use it. Take the money.

42:39.126 --> 42:42.261
I don't need money. I need a job.

42:42.329 --> 42:45.131
You wouldn't even be in this room
if you weren't related to Roger.

42:45.199 --> 42:47.166
But I am. It's all I have...

42:47.234 --> 42:50.403
That and my ideas.

43:02.750 --> 43:04.317
This place is fantastic.

43:04.384 --> 43:07.053
Lane, could you leave us please?

43:09.156 --> 43:10.556
Certainly.

43:26.507 --> 43:28.541
I've given this a lot of thought.

43:28.609 --> 43:30.409
Me too.

43:30.477 --> 43:33.012
If you're open to the direction

43:33.080 --> 43:35.114
and tenor of the business
I'm doing here,

43:35.182 --> 43:38.284
I think you'd be
a great addition to my team.

43:38.352 --> 43:40.119
How's that supposed to mean?

43:40.187 --> 43:43.556
That things have changed
in a permanent way.

43:45.292 --> 43:47.093
I'd say nothing's changed.

43:49.229 --> 43:50.897
Look, Ken,

43:50.964 --> 43:52.999
everyone here likes you,

43:53.066 --> 43:55.401
but this is a small shop

43:55.469 --> 43:57.403
and I need to know
you can do as told.

44:15.055 --> 44:16.789
So...

44:18.158 --> 44:20.426
How are the wedding plans coming?

44:22.429 --> 44:23.596
Peggy!

44:28.068 --> 44:29.969
Take Danny over to Joan.
He's starting next Monday.

44:30.037 --> 44:31.604
Are you kidding?

44:32.906 --> 44:35.508
You will not be sorry.

44:35.576 --> 44:36.909
Go away.

44:44.585 --> 44:46.452
Wait here.

44:54.428 --> 44:58.331
I always liked chocolate ice cream,
but my mother made us eat vanilla

44:58.398 --> 44:59.799
because it didn't stain anything.

45:02.636 --> 45:05.471
- I hired Jane's cousin.
- Really?

45:05.539 --> 45:07.206
What changed your mind?

45:08.508 --> 45:09.742
Couldn't live without him.

45:11.345 --> 45:12.712
Well...

45:14.281 --> 45:16.182
One good turn deserves another.

45:20.988 --> 45:23.189
You left it at the bar.

45:23.257 --> 45:25.491
Too much celebrating, I guess.

45:25.559 --> 45:27.793
Yeah, that happens.

45:27.861 --> 45:30.630
I'll give it back
if you just say one thing:

45:30.697 --> 45:33.266
You couldn't have
done it without me.

45:33.333 --> 45:34.767
Did I not say that?

45:36.837 --> 45:38.337
I was wrong.

45:43.810 --> 45:45.177
Thank you.

45:59.026 --> 46:00.760
Mr. Sterling.

46:00.827 --> 46:03.796
- Good morning.
- Jesus. Would you leave me alone?

46:03.864 --> 46:05.798
You told me to come in.

46:07.334 --> 46:09.835
- The hell I did.
- You hired me.

46:09.903 --> 46:12.204
What? When?

46:12.272 --> 46:15.474
Yesterday. You said,
"welcome aboard."
