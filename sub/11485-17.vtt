WEBVTT

00:02.552 --> 00:06.579
- Hey! There he is! High five!
- Down low. Too slow.

00:07.190 --> 00:10.682
Come here, clown. Upside down.

00:13.830 --> 00:16.196
- Hello, Charlie.
- Judith, how's it going?

00:16.265 --> 00:19.997
Hey, Uncle Charlie, show Mom
how I mop the floor with my hair.

00:20.270 --> 00:23.171
Well, it's not really mopping.
It's more like dusting.

00:23.339 --> 00:27.605
- What if you drop him on his head?
- Then I guess I will have to mop.

00:27.911 --> 00:30.539
- Wonderful. Where's Alan?
- He's in the kitchen.

00:32.247 --> 00:34.273
Walk this way.

00:38.888 --> 00:40.219
Master,

00:42.425 --> 00:45.519
your sexually ambivalent ex-wife is here.

00:46.730 --> 00:50.723
- I'm not ambivalent, I'm exploring.
- Yes, mistress.

00:52.602 --> 00:56.629
- Thanks for bringing Jake over.
- Well, I wanted to give you this anyway.

00:56.740 --> 00:59.732
- What is it?
- It's the bill from my divorce lawyer.

00:59.809 --> 01:03.370
- You haven't been paying them.
- Told you they'd notice.

01:03.446 --> 01:06.244
I also need you
to look this over and sign it.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.079
And what is this?

01:08.151 --> 01:11.780
My lawyer recommended I take out
a bigger life-insurance policy on you

01:11.888 --> 01:16.052
in case you should die
and can't pay the alimony and legal fees.

01:16.593 --> 01:17.992
Why don't you have him frozen?

01:18.094 --> 01:20.756
Then you can use him
to keep your drinks cold, too.

01:21.431 --> 01:23.422
And who's supposed to pay for this policy?

01:23.500 --> 01:26.435
You are. And please,
try to be on time with the premiums.

01:27.170 --> 01:31.106
Boy, my shallow, empty lifestyle
is looking pretty good right about now.

01:31.741 --> 01:35.973
Okay, as long as we're on the subject
of lawyers and death,

01:36.079 --> 01:39.640
my lawyer recommended
that I redraft my will. And you know what?

01:39.749 --> 01:43.310
If I die after you die,
guess who gets custody of Jake?

01:43.419 --> 01:46.752
- Charlie.
- Charlie?

01:46.823 --> 01:48.950
- Me?
- What about my sister?

01:49.025 --> 01:53.018
- I never liked your sister.
- Is this the sister I slept with?

01:53.163 --> 01:55.461
Shut up, Charlie.

01:55.532 --> 01:59.332
Alan, you can't be serious.
He's immature, he drinks too much,

01:59.435 --> 02:01.665
he sleeps around,
he is completely irresponsible.

02:01.771 --> 02:04.797
Yeah, you should've thought of that
before you threw me out.

02:05.675 --> 02:06.869
Yeah.

02:07.177 --> 02:10.305
All right. You're obviously angry
and trying to get even with me,

02:10.380 --> 02:13.816
but I am not gonna take the bait.
I will see you on Sunday.

02:13.950 --> 02:15.281
Bye-bye.

02:18.822 --> 02:21.052
- Hey, man. Thanks.
- For what?

02:21.157 --> 02:24.285
For trusting me to take care of Jake
when you croak.

02:26.196 --> 02:29.290
I'm sorry.
You didn't think I was serious, did you?

02:29.666 --> 02:31.691
I just said that to piss her off.

02:32.735 --> 02:37.365
Right. Good one. Hey!

02:39.000 --> 02:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:47.884 --> 02:49.215
That's not fair!

02:49.319 --> 02:51.879
Why don't I get to keep the kid
when you're dead?

02:53.990 --> 02:58.222
If I'm dead. And Judith would have to die
before me for it to even be an issue.

02:58.328 --> 03:02.025
It's a contingency plan
for a hypothetical worst-case scenario.

03:02.098 --> 03:05.158
I know it's a long shot,
but I had the Marlins in the World Series.

03:05.235 --> 03:07.169
Don't tell me they don't come in.

03:07.237 --> 03:10.172
It never occurred to me that you'd
want to be a full-time parent.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.868
This isn't about what I want.
This is about what you want,

03:12.942 --> 03:15.206
- and you don't want me to have Jake.
- What?

03:15.278 --> 03:16.370
Nothing.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.936
Why'd you say my name?

03:18.047 --> 03:20.174
Get over yourself, no one said your name.

03:21.251 --> 03:22.548
So what's wrong with me?

03:22.619 --> 03:25.713
Charlie, you're a great uncle.
You're there for all the fun stuff.

03:25.788 --> 03:29.383
I don't think you're up to the hard work
of being a full-time parent to Jake.

03:29.459 --> 03:30.551
- What?
- Nothing.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.958
Nothing.

03:38.368 --> 03:40.734
So if not me,
then who are you giving him to?

03:40.803 --> 03:44.136
I'm not giving him to anybody.
He's not a 5-pound ham.

03:45.241 --> 03:48.472
You know what I mean.
Who gets him in that scenario thing?

03:48.578 --> 03:52.810
- Cousin Jerry and his wife Faye.
- Jerry and Faye? Why Jerry and Faye?

03:52.949 --> 03:57.113
They've got a good marriage,
three kids, lots of dogs, a big backyard,

03:57.186 --> 03:59.120
and they live in a great school district.

03:59.188 --> 04:01.281
Yeah, but I'm your brother!

04:02.125 --> 04:04.093
- Charlie, it's not...
- And I live right here.

04:04.160 --> 04:08.096
You wouldn't have to ship him off
to Corn Hole, Kansas.

04:09.098 --> 04:11.089
Coventry, Rhode Island.

04:12.135 --> 04:14.501
Who am I thinking of that lives in Kansas?

04:14.604 --> 04:17.004
I don't know, Dorothy and Toto?

04:19.108 --> 04:21.940
All right, Alan, let me ask you something.

04:22.011 --> 04:24.673
If I'm here, and Jake's in Rhode Island,

04:24.781 --> 04:27.249
who's gonna teach him
all the things he needs to know?

04:27.317 --> 04:29.979
Jerry and Faye
are both college professors.

04:30.086 --> 04:32.486
I'm talking about the important stuff.
About life.

04:32.588 --> 04:34.021
Face it. When the time comes,

04:34.123 --> 04:37.115
are those two eggheads gonna step up
and get your kid laid?

04:39.829 --> 04:45.028
- You're not helping your case, Charlie.
- Fine, you've made your decision.

04:45.335 --> 04:47.701
Despite all I've been through
with your son,

04:47.804 --> 04:50.739
my nephew,
obviously I have no say in the matter.

04:50.907 --> 04:52.033
Where are you going?

04:52.108 --> 04:55.100
Alan, quite frankly,
I'm a little hurt and a little disappointed,

04:55.178 --> 04:57.373
so I'm gonna go make myself
a big glass of vodka

04:57.447 --> 04:59.779
and sit and think about things.

04:59.849 --> 05:03.910
Charlie, wait. Okay, how about this?

05:04.520 --> 05:07.956
If Judith dies and then I die,
and then Jerry and Faye die,

05:08.024 --> 05:10.015
Jake will come and live with you.

05:10.526 --> 05:13.586
Yeah, like I'm gonna outlive
Jerry and Faye the way I drink.

05:17.767 --> 05:21.134
- What do you say to Grandma?
- Can I at least open it first?

05:21.204 --> 05:23.195
- Jake.
- No, he's right.

05:23.306 --> 05:25.365
Wait and see if he likes it.

05:29.278 --> 05:33.874
- Now you can thank me.
- Thank you.

05:34.851 --> 05:36.648
I'm kidding.

05:36.719 --> 05:40.382
No little boy wants a framed picture
of his grandmommy.

05:40.490 --> 05:42.515
This is for your daddy.

05:44.160 --> 05:47.186
- What do you say, Dad?
- Don't push me, Jake.

05:48.064 --> 05:50.396
That's my new photo
for the Sunday real estate section.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.162
I thought maybe you'd like
a color print of it for your office.

05:53.236 --> 05:56.467
Gee, Mom, we've already got the one
of you swimming with dolphins.

05:57.306 --> 05:59.137
So you didn't bring me anything?

06:00.076 --> 06:03.568
Is that all grandmommy is good for,
to bring you gifts?

06:04.714 --> 06:09.048
Of course I brought you something. There.

06:11.921 --> 06:14.856
Crayons? I'm 10.

06:15.925 --> 06:18.257
Well, it's not just crayons, sweetheart.

06:18.361 --> 06:21.489
It's also a dinosaur coloring book.

06:22.698 --> 06:27.328
- But I'm 10.
- You want to trade?

06:28.671 --> 06:30.195
No, I'm good.

06:31.741 --> 06:35.939
- So, where's your brother?
- Why? What'd he get?

06:37.046 --> 06:39.913
Nothing. I just want to make sure
he knows why.

06:41.417 --> 06:43.715
He's in his room.
He's been sulking all weekend.

06:43.786 --> 06:47.347
- Sulking? About what?
- Well, it's the silliest thing.

06:47.423 --> 06:49.050
I just happened to mention

06:49.125 --> 06:52.458
that in the unlikely event
that Judith should die, and I should die,

06:52.562 --> 06:55.224
that custody of Jake would go to...

07:00.770 --> 07:05.469
- Custody of Jake would go to who?
- Actually, it would be "whom. "

07:07.477 --> 07:11.777
- Alan, who gets Jake?
- Now, see, that's grammatically correct.

07:13.449 --> 07:15.610
- Alan.
- Jerry and Faye.

07:16.052 --> 07:17.883
Jerry and Faye who?

07:18.621 --> 07:23.388
- Your sister's son and his wife.
- Them?

07:24.427 --> 07:27.225
You would bypass your own mother

07:27.330 --> 07:30.629
in favor of two potato farmers
on Long Island?

07:31.734 --> 07:34.794
They're agriculture professors
in Rhode Island.

07:34.904 --> 07:36.166
Really?

07:36.405 --> 07:39.101
Who am I thinking of
who lives on Long Island?

07:39.475 --> 07:41.500
I have no idea.

07:41.611 --> 07:46.105
- Well, regardless, I am deeply insulted.
- Come on, Mom.

07:46.182 --> 07:49.083
This is only if Judith and I both die,
and we're not dying.

07:49.152 --> 07:53.486
- At least, not before you.
- Now you're wishing me dead.

07:53.589 --> 07:56.683
- No, Mom. No, it's...
- Give me back my picture.

08:04.834 --> 08:09.635
No. Better you should look at it
and feel shame.

08:22.018 --> 08:25.181
- Hey, want to play one-on-one?
- Sure.

08:25.555 --> 08:27.045
Check it out.

08:32.895 --> 08:34.453
One, nothing.

08:37.166 --> 08:39.566
You know that Rhode Island
isn't really an island?

08:39.669 --> 08:41.864
That's just a flat-out lie.

08:48.144 --> 08:49.509
Two, nothing.

08:49.579 --> 08:52.571
Hey, I've got to run some errands,
so I'll be back in about an hour.

08:52.648 --> 08:53.842
You guys gonna be okay?

08:53.916 --> 08:56.077
Gee, Alan,
you sure I can handle the responsibility?

08:56.185 --> 08:59.382
What if he wants to go to college
or something?

09:00.156 --> 09:02.716
Charlie, please don't start.
I'll see you later.

09:02.858 --> 09:06.692
- Hey!
- Three, nothing.

09:08.030 --> 09:10.521
- That was a time-out.
- You didn't call it.

09:10.700 --> 09:13.999
- Fine. Three, nothing.
- You want a do-over?

09:14.070 --> 09:17.733
No, I don't want a do-over.
Just bring it on.

09:21.844 --> 09:23.709
Not so easy when I'm paying attention,
is it?

09:23.779 --> 09:25.679
Not so hard, either.

09:31.254 --> 09:33.188
- My head!
- Oh, God.

09:37.393 --> 09:39.384
- You okay?
- No.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.559
- All right, don't panic.
- I'm not panicking.

09:42.765 --> 09:46.428
Good. You're gonna be fine.

09:46.936 --> 09:49.837
- We've just got to stop the bleeding.
- I'm bleeding?

09:53.542 --> 09:56.170
- What?
- Nothing. Just a little trickle.

09:56.712 --> 09:59.545
Here, take my shirt. Hold it up here.

09:59.882 --> 10:03.841
I'm sorry.
Okay, let's get you up, nice and slow.

10:03.919 --> 10:06.683
Attaboy. I'll grab my car keys
and we'll head to the hospital.

10:06.756 --> 10:09.190
A hospital?
I don't want to go to a hospital!

10:09.258 --> 10:12.091
Did I say "hospital"? I meant Disneyland.

10:13.763 --> 10:16.254
How's it going there, pal?
You still bleeding?

10:16.365 --> 10:18.890
- I don't know.
- No, don't look.

10:19.935 --> 10:21.994
You just hang in there,
we'll get you fixed up,

10:22.071 --> 10:24.232
and you'll be back home
before you know it.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.267
Just as soon as we find
the freaking hospital.

10:27.910 --> 10:32.210
- You don't know where the hospital is?
- Of course I know where it is.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.914
I'm kind of hungry.
Can we stop for a chili cheeseburger?

10:37.987 --> 10:40.888
You're hungry?
How could you even think about food?

10:40.956 --> 10:43.481
What do you think about
when you're hungry?

10:44.627 --> 10:46.117
Fair enough.

10:47.129 --> 10:49.825
We'll get you a chili cheeseburger
at the hospital.

10:49.932 --> 10:53.424
- Will they have fries at the hospital?
- They have everything.

10:53.502 --> 10:55.834
Some people go just for the food.

10:57.473 --> 10:59.839
Man, we'd better call your dad.

11:06.282 --> 11:07.510
Hello?

11:08.317 --> 11:11.150
- Why do you have your father's phone?
- I don't know.

11:13.022 --> 11:15.149
- That's great.
- Bye.

11:19.929 --> 11:23.695
Yes! An ambulance.
Fifty-fifty shot he's going to a hospital.

11:24.133 --> 11:25.430
Hang on!

11:28.337 --> 11:30.168
I can't believe we beat the ambulance.

11:30.272 --> 11:33.207
Yeah, well, those things are just
ice-cream trucks with blood bags.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.539
Hi, we need to see a doctor.

11:35.644 --> 11:39.045
- All right. Just fill this out and have a seat.
- No, you don't understand.

11:39.148 --> 11:41.116
He hit his head, he's bleeding.

11:41.183 --> 11:43.276
- Did he lose consciousness?
- No.

11:43.386 --> 11:45.684
I got a little woozy, though.

11:46.188 --> 11:47.951
Follow my finger.

11:49.992 --> 11:51.789
He's gonna be fine.

11:52.661 --> 11:55.289
That's it? He's gonna be fine?

11:56.332 --> 11:59.392
That's not a medical test,
that's how you hypnotize a chicken.

12:00.469 --> 12:03.700
I'd like a chili cheeseburger and fries,
please.

12:04.240 --> 12:08.370
You see, he's hallucinating.
Can you please just get him in to a doctor?

12:08.477 --> 12:10.138
Well, you need to fill this out first.

12:10.212 --> 12:13.306
Come on, this is gonna take forever.
Can't we do this later?

12:15.217 --> 12:16.707
Over dinner?

12:17.219 --> 12:19.346
Now you're hallucinating.

12:20.523 --> 12:22.150
Come on, buddy.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.393
All right. Let's see. Last name, Harper.

12:29.765 --> 12:32.256
First name, Jake. Ob?

12:33.269 --> 12:36.568
Jacob. I knew that. Middle name?

12:36.839 --> 12:38.932
- You don't know?
- Of course I know.

12:39.041 --> 12:41.601
I want to see if you know.
You fell on your head, dude.

12:41.710 --> 12:42.734
David.

12:43.746 --> 12:47.079
Jacob David. They went full Old Testament
on you, didn't they?

12:48.017 --> 12:51.748
- Age, 10. Allergies?
- I don't know.

12:52.621 --> 12:55.385
Is there anything you eat
that makes you sick?

12:56.392 --> 12:58.121
I ate a worm once.

12:59.595 --> 13:02.291
No allergies.
Have you had any of the following?

13:02.398 --> 13:03.956
- Measles?
- I don't know.

13:04.066 --> 13:05.363
- Mumps?
- I don't know.

13:05.434 --> 13:07.766
- Chicken pox?
- Is that the one with the spots?

13:07.870 --> 13:09.735
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

13:11.407 --> 13:14.740
All right. We're just gonna vote
the straight "no" ticket.

13:14.810 --> 13:16.437
Family history?

13:17.379 --> 13:20.109
Your grandmother's always been
a pain in the ass.

13:20.716 --> 13:21.876
Gonzales?

13:22.718 --> 13:25.653
- Right here!
- I'm Gonzales.

13:28.157 --> 13:29.749
No, you're not.

13:32.495 --> 13:34.963
Right. He's Gonzales.

13:38.968 --> 13:43.405
- Okay, you're gonna feel a little sting.
- Nobody said I had to get a shot!

13:43.472 --> 13:46.066
It's just to numb your skin
so you won't feel the stitches.

13:46.141 --> 13:48.974
What are you gonna give me
to not feel the shot?

13:49.445 --> 13:52.073
It's all right, pal. I'm right here with you.

13:52.181 --> 13:55.014
Big deal.
I'm still gonna get a shot in my head.

13:56.619 --> 13:59.850
Come on, just hold my hand,
look me in the eyes.

14:00.155 --> 14:01.281
Go ahead, Doc.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.989
- Hey, go easy on the kid!
- No, you're squishing my hand!

14:08.864 --> 14:11.458
Sorry.
But you didn't feel the shot, did you?

14:11.534 --> 14:13.001
- No.
- You're welcome.

14:14.503 --> 14:16.266
Maybe you'd prefer to wait outside.

14:16.338 --> 14:18.704
I'd prefer a morphine drip
and a sponge bath,

14:18.807 --> 14:20.707
but the kid needs me.

14:21.510 --> 14:25.207
- How many stitches am I gonna get?
- I don't know, three or four.

14:25.314 --> 14:27.145
That's all? Scott Pressman got nine

14:27.216 --> 14:29.616
when his sister hit him
with the Etch-A-Sketch.

14:30.486 --> 14:32.113
Help us out here, Doc.

14:32.187 --> 14:34.712
Okay, I'll go five,
but one is purely decorative.

14:34.823 --> 14:36.120
Thank you.

14:36.191 --> 14:38.785
- Is this gonna leave a scar?
- I'm afraid so.

14:38.861 --> 14:40.556
- No.
- Yes!

14:41.230 --> 14:43.323
Okay, let's get started.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.392
Good, maybe that's your father.

14:47.403 --> 14:50.201
Hello. Hey, Judith.

14:53.042 --> 14:54.976
No, it's me, Charlie.

14:55.878 --> 15:00.315
What am I doing with Alan's phone?
Why? Do you want custody of that, too?

15:03.519 --> 15:05.419
Come on, that's funny.

15:07.156 --> 15:10.148
I don't know. Maybe Alan and I
accidentally switched phones.

15:10.225 --> 15:14.389
Why don't you try calling him on mine?
310-LICKME.

15:19.568 --> 15:22.696
I didn't pick it, but that's what it spells.

15:23.672 --> 15:25.196
Okay. Goodbye.

15:25.274 --> 15:27.242
Are you doing it?
'Cause I can't feel anything.

15:27.343 --> 15:30.506
- Yeah, that's the idea.
- Can you see my brain?

15:32.114 --> 15:35.606
Sure, it's a big brain.
You must be very smart.

15:37.386 --> 15:41.049
- Phone's ringing.
- No, it's not.

15:42.057 --> 15:45.288
The doctor's just stimulating
the phone-ring part of your brain.

15:46.795 --> 15:48.922
- Right, Doc?
- Sure, why not?

15:49.798 --> 15:53.791
I ordered a chili cheeseburger out there.
Will they know to bring it in?

15:57.206 --> 16:00.698
Come on, Mom. Those are
two completely different scenarios.

16:02.411 --> 16:03.537
Hey.

16:06.448 --> 16:07.881
Cool hats.

16:08.450 --> 16:11.886
So, you're saying that because
I didn't name you as Jake's guardian,

16:11.954 --> 16:15.412
you're switching your medical
power of attorney from me to Charlie?

16:15.524 --> 16:17.355
- What's going on?
- Hang on.

16:17.426 --> 16:21.760
If Mom's ever in a coma, you're the one
who has to decide to pull the plug.

16:25.034 --> 16:26.228
Pull.

16:27.770 --> 16:31.137
All right, Mom, Charlie's onboard.
Yeah, got to go.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.537
Hey, where have you guys been?

16:32.608 --> 16:35.441
You know,
we went and got a couple of hamburgers,

16:35.544 --> 16:37.273
bought some hats.

16:39.415 --> 16:42.111
Ate the hamburgers, wearing the hats.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.279
Okay.

16:44.553 --> 16:48.250
- You're right, he bought it.
- Bought what?

16:50.225 --> 16:52.785
Dude, you can forget about a life of crime.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.827
Oh, my God. What happened?

16:58.067 --> 17:00.627
We were playing basketball,
and it got a little rough.

17:00.736 --> 17:02.226
- He fouled me.
- You charged.

17:02.304 --> 17:03.464
- Did not.
- Did, too!

17:03.572 --> 17:04.596
Hold on.

17:04.673 --> 17:06.766
- So you took him to the emergency room?
- Yes.

17:06.842 --> 17:09.810
Where the cheeseburgers sucked,
by the way.

17:09.912 --> 17:12.005
But he's okay?
There's no concussion or anything?

17:12.114 --> 17:14.105
- No.
- We saw my brain.

17:14.183 --> 17:16.651
No, we didn't. We didn't see any brains.

17:17.252 --> 17:19.516
Hey, why didn't you call me?

17:20.422 --> 17:23.414
There it is.
Why do you have my cell phone?

17:23.659 --> 17:25.183
I don't know.

17:25.928 --> 17:28.157
All right. You sure you're okay?

17:28.797 --> 17:31.129
- Can I go watch TV?
- Sure.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.363
I am really sorry, Alan.

17:37.606 --> 17:41.133
- Don't worry about it. He's fine.
- Yeah, but I'm not.

17:41.610 --> 17:42.770
You were right.

17:42.845 --> 17:46.212
I obviously can't be trusted
to take care of Jake.

17:46.715 --> 17:48.615
Believe me,
the second you're in the ground,

17:48.684 --> 17:51.346
I'm sticking that kid on a plane
to Rhode Island.

17:52.387 --> 17:54.048
Charlie, let me tell you something.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.386
You can't keep Jake
from ever getting hurt.

17:56.492 --> 17:59.393
I mean, he's a boy. That's...
Getting hurt is like his job.

17:59.995 --> 18:04.489
Last summer, he actually fractured his ass
doing a cannonball into the bathtub.

18:05.634 --> 18:08.125
All I care about
is that he has somebody who loves him

18:08.203 --> 18:12.367
and who'll step up when it really counts.
And that's what you did today.

18:13.475 --> 18:16.410
Yeah, I guess I did, didn't I?

18:16.745 --> 18:18.906
Yeah. And if, God forbid,

18:19.014 --> 18:22.074
something should ever happen
to Judith and me,

18:23.752 --> 18:28.246
I would be very comfortable knowing
that you were looking after my son.

18:28.891 --> 18:30.859
Dead, but comfortable.

18:34.863 --> 18:37.525
Does this mean
you're putting me in the will?

18:38.267 --> 18:41.998
- Yeah.
- Wow. Thanks, man.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.003
That means a lot.

18:47.776 --> 18:50.836
- Just do me a favor, all right?
- What's that?

18:50.913 --> 18:52.346
Don't die.

18:59.922 --> 19:02.720
- That's a very cute hat.
- Thank you.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.250
It makes my hair sweat.

19:06.628 --> 19:08.994
Oh, my God!
What happened to your head?

19:09.097 --> 19:12.066
I got five stitches.
There was blood everywhere.

19:13.101 --> 19:15.831
- Why didn't anyone tell me?
- I just did.

19:16.738 --> 19:19.901
- Can we stop for pizza?
- I can't believe this.

19:19.975 --> 19:22.842
I'm going to have a little talk
with your father.

19:28.517 --> 19:29.779
Hello?

19:57.980 --> 19:59.174
