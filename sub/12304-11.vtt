00:30.550 --> 00:33.310
<i>This is the State of Florida v. Sonya Barak.</i>

00:33.380 --> 00:36.080
The charges alleged are accessory to kidnapping.

00:36.150 --> 00:38.680
Mr. Chandler,you can call your first witness.

00:44.410 --> 00:47.950
Lieutenant Caine, do you recognize Sonya Barak

00:48.010 --> 00:50.110
in the courtroom today?

00:50.180 --> 00:51.510
I do.

00:51.580 --> 00:54.180
The name we had at the time was Sonya Moreta.

00:54.250 --> 00:55.950
Lieutenant,when you asked

00:56.010 --> 00:59.980
Ms. Barak to reveal her plan, what did she say?

01:01.550 --> 01:03.350
<i>My plan...</i>

01:03.410 --> 01:07.680
<i>is to just sit back,relax,</i>

01:07.750 --> 01:10.910
<i>and watch as the world we know changes forever.</i>

01:14.080 --> 01:16.010
Did she tell you anymore?

01:20.450 --> 01:22.980
<i>My world believes in the death of America.</i>

01:23.050 --> 01:26.350
<i>It's already in motion.</i>

01:26.410 --> 01:28.580
<i>I wouldn't stop it even if I could.</i>

01:32.750 --> 01:35.580
Her plan was to blow up the nuclear power plant

01:35.650 --> 01:38.050
at Turkey Point, but we took care of that.

01:38.110 --> 01:40.510
I object. Not relevant to the case.

01:40.580 --> 01:41.880
Your Honor,

01:41.950 --> 01:43.750
State will show Ms. Barak has direct ties

01:43.810 --> 01:45.510
to the Al-Qadr terrorist organization.

01:45.580 --> 01:46.850
Baseless assertions

01:46.910 --> 01:48.650
that have no bearing on these proceedings.

01:48.710 --> 01:50.050
Mr. Chandler, limit your questions

01:50.110 --> 01:51.880
to the charges at hand.

01:51.950 --> 01:54.080
Nothing further.

01:54.150 --> 01:56.210
Lieutenant Caine,you testified

01:56.280 --> 01:58.850
that Sonya Barak was involved with the kidnapping

01:58.910 --> 02:01.110
of the Kinkella family, is that correct?

02:01.180 --> 02:03.080
That's correct.

02:03.150 --> 02:05.410
And do you have any evidence connecting her to this crime?

02:05.480 --> 02:06.750
She had specific knowledge

02:06.810 --> 02:08.710
as to the whereabouts of the family.

02:14.850 --> 02:16.450
And she provided authorities

02:16.510 --> 02:18.550
with that information, didn't she?

02:18.610 --> 02:19.880
She did.

02:19.950 --> 02:21.580
Information that led to their safe return?

02:21.650 --> 02:24.110
Yes,in exchange for a reduction of charges.

02:24.180 --> 02:25.750
Just answer the question, Lieutenant Caine.

02:25.810 --> 02:28.980
Did Ms. Barak provide authorities with information

02:29.050 --> 02:30.610
that led to their safe return?

02:30.680 --> 02:32.250
As I stated,

02:32.310 --> 02:34.210
as part of legal maneuvering, she provided the information.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.810
Nothing further.

02:35.880 --> 02:38.310
Your Honor, as Lieutenant Caine

02:38.380 --> 02:41.610
has just confirmed, were it not for Ms. Barak,

02:41.680 --> 02:43.610
the Kinkella family would not be alive today.

02:43.680 --> 02:46.450
For that,I ask that she be released on bond.

02:46.510 --> 02:48.880
Ms. Barak's admission of involvement provides

02:48.950 --> 02:51.750
the court sufficient cause to the bind the charge

02:51.810 --> 02:55.750
of accessory to kidnapping over for trial.

02:55.810 --> 02:57.410
Bail is set at one million dollars.

02:57.480 --> 02:59.780
Ms. Barak will return to stand trial

02:59.850 --> 03:01.950
four weeks from this day.

03:09.610 --> 03:12.080
Lieutenant Caine! What happened in there?

03:12.150 --> 03:14.680
I thought you were going to put me on the stand?

03:14.750 --> 03:16.180
Now hang on a second, Mr. Kinkella...

03:16.250 --> 03:17.850
That's why we cut the immunity deal,

03:17.910 --> 03:19.610
so I could testify against her.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.750
Mr. Kinkella, I understand your confusion.

03:21.810 --> 03:23.850
My confusion? That woman is a terrorist.

03:23.910 --> 03:25.150
She kidnapped my family.

03:25.210 --> 03:28.410
Ms. Barak is going to be dealt with in due time.

03:28.480 --> 03:29.510
Due...?

03:31.510 --> 03:34.310
I... never should have trusted you.

05:43.990 --> 05:47.390
Shooter left behind a cartridge casing,

05:47.460 --> 05:49.190
Nine-millimeter.

05:49.260 --> 05:52.130
Dead defense attorney-

05:52.190 --> 05:53.890
a long line of suspects.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.790
Starting with Sonya's people.

05:55.860 --> 05:58.460
Her attorney pulled off the impossible-

05:58.530 --> 05:59.830
got her out on bail.

05:59.890 --> 06:01.290
So,here's my question.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.260
Shoot.

06:02.330 --> 06:03.560
Why kill the guy?

06:03.630 --> 06:05.830
<i>That is a good question.</i>

06:16.790 --> 06:18.760
Did you run the plates on the shooter's car?

06:18.830 --> 06:20.430
I did.

06:25.290 --> 06:27.360
Meet the owner.

06:27.430 --> 06:30.360
This kid?

06:30.430 --> 06:31.890
Apparently.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.790
Craig Edwards... He looks like a beach bum.

06:35.860 --> 06:37.330
It's not what I expected.

06:37.390 --> 06:39.960
That's exactly why we need to talk to him.

06:44.060 --> 06:47.190
Hold out your hands, Mr. Edwards.

06:49.930 --> 06:51.560
Mr. Edwards,your Corvette was

06:51.630 --> 06:53.530
in the courthouse parking lot this morning,

06:53.590 --> 06:55.890
so you shot the defense attorney.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.430
Some of my buds took the 'vette for a spin.

06:58.490 --> 06:59.590
Talk to them.

06:59.660 --> 07:01.390
I'm talking to you.

07:03.030 --> 07:05.890
Whoever did it, can't say I'm sorry.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.490
Why do you say that?

07:07.560 --> 07:09.590
You think Sonya's getting a fair shake in the court system?

07:09.660 --> 07:11.060
You're kidding yourself.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.830
Your whole legal system's corrupt,

07:12.890 --> 07:15.090
just like your country.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.130
Son,aren't you from Pensacola?

07:17.190 --> 07:19.490
Pensacola means nothing to me now.

07:22.260 --> 07:24.690
You're positive for GSR, Mr. Edwards.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.560
GSR? What's...? Gunshot residue.

07:26.630 --> 07:29.490
It means you shot the attorney.

07:31.860 --> 07:33.960
He deserved it.

07:34.030 --> 07:36.430
Some people would call me a he.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.430
I'd call you a terrorist.

07:38.490 --> 07:40.760
Now,you're Al-Qadr, aren't you?

07:40.830 --> 07:42.230
Craig! Don't answer that.

07:42.290 --> 07:43.530
Who are you?

07:43.590 --> 07:45.460
Larry Fremont,Craig's attorney.

07:45.530 --> 07:46.990
Your his attorney?

07:47.060 --> 07:48.860
If I were you,I'd get a bodyguard,immediately.

07:48.930 --> 07:50.290
Now,was Sonya in on this?

07:50.360 --> 07:51.530
Aw,come on, I object.

07:51.590 --> 07:53.390
Okay,this is not a court of law,Counselor.

07:53.460 --> 07:55.390
Last I checked, we're still the United States.

07:55.460 --> 07:58.690
I understand. Was she in on it or not?

08:00.490 --> 08:02.430
Speak to my attorney.

08:02.490 --> 08:04.260
Mr. Edwards will be taking the Fifth Amendment

08:04.330 --> 08:05.530
so as not to incriminate.

08:05.590 --> 08:06.790
If you ask him one more question,

08:06.860 --> 08:09.360
we will sue you on constutional grounds.

08:09.430 --> 08:11.460
So,you gentlemen despise our justice system

08:11.530 --> 08:13.130
until you need it.

08:14.530 --> 08:15.560
Book him.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.030
Tell me the address again.

08:21.090 --> 08:22.730
Okay,I'm on my way. Thanks.

08:22.790 --> 08:24.160
So,what's up?

08:24.230 --> 08:26.330
Homicide just pulled over Tanninger's car.

08:26.390 --> 08:27.760
The dead lawyer?

08:27.830 --> 08:29.830
So,did they find Sonya?

08:29.890 --> 08:32.159
No,one male; they're holding him.

08:32.230 --> 08:34.390
All right, let's go over there.

08:41.460 --> 08:43.730
Let's get him away from the car.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.190
What's your name?

08:45.260 --> 08:46.890
Hector Rivera.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.290
Well,Hector,you want to tell us where Sonya Barak is?

08:49.360 --> 08:50.960
I don't know who that is.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.860
She's the woman last seen driving this car.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.260
How'd you get it?

08:57.330 --> 08:59.230
Uh,found it. The keys was in the ignition.

08:59.290 --> 09:00.990
Hmm. Why do I doubt that?

09:01.060 --> 09:02.560
Let's step away from the car.

09:02.630 --> 09:04.090
You got the trunk?

09:04.160 --> 09:05.260
Yeah.

09:07.530 --> 09:09.260
Is that the killer? Is that him?

09:09.330 --> 09:11.630
Doyle,what are you doing here?

09:11.690 --> 09:12.930
I thought you switched to nights.

09:12.990 --> 09:14.230
Film's not as pretty.

09:14.290 --> 09:16.160
Besides,you guys get all the hot cases.

09:16.230 --> 09:18.890
CSIs have reason to believe

09:18.960 --> 09:21.090
the runway defendant is in the trunk.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.430
Just do me a favor, be seen and not heard,okay?

09:23.490 --> 09:25.490
I'm here on mayor's orders, remember?

09:25.560 --> 09:28.290
Look,just give me a little room.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.290
Oh,man.

09:37.030 --> 09:39.690
Cal, I've got a DB...

09:39.760 --> 09:41.630
30s,male,

09:41.690 --> 09:43.090
multiple stab wounds.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.730
Bet you didn't know him either, did you Hector?

09:45.790 --> 09:48.290
Come on,let's take a ride.

09:52.990 --> 09:55.690
You working on our defense attorney?

09:55.760 --> 09:58.060
Just about to.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.130
Hey,I thought that little terrorist suspect

10:00.190 --> 10:01.760
already confessed to shooting him.

10:01.830 --> 10:03.160
Craig Edwards? Yeah,he did.

10:03.230 --> 10:05.160
But you know these Al-Qadr types-

10:05.230 --> 10:06.790
we have to make sure there's no loopholes.

10:06.860 --> 10:11.290
Okay. Well, from what I can see so far,

10:11.360 --> 10:14.630
Mr. Tanninger took a round in the neck-

10:14.690 --> 10:17.660
entrance and exit.

10:17.730 --> 10:19.790
So through and through. So where's the projectile?

10:19.860 --> 10:22.130
It's got to be somewhere back at the crime scene.

10:22.190 --> 10:25.330
Then,that's where Horatio and I will be.

10:33.660 --> 10:36.990
So,the shot that killed Tanninger went through him,

10:37.060 --> 10:39.760
which means the round came this way.

10:59.730 --> 11:00.990
Could be a nine-millimeter.

11:01.060 --> 11:03.130
It's got blood on it.

11:03.190 --> 11:05.130
Could be the kill shot.

11:20.230 --> 11:21.490
Horatio,if the shooter was driving

11:21.560 --> 11:23.690
by the front of the car,

11:23.760 --> 11:26.090
he couldn't possibly have shot him from there.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.990
I agree,Ms. Boa Vista.

11:28.060 --> 11:29.930
Will you move the bendy,please?

11:41.060 --> 11:44.390
This bullet ricocheted.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.730
It wasn't aimed at Tanninger.

11:52.790 --> 11:54.690
It was aimed at the passenger.

11:54.760 --> 11:56.760
They were trying to kill Sonya.

11:56.830 --> 11:58.790
Yes,they were.

11:58.860 --> 12:00.890
That means she's in a lot of danger.

12:00.960 --> 12:03.560
And,possibly, from her own people.

12:03.630 --> 12:06.030
But she was helping them in a plot to blow up Miami.

12:06.090 --> 12:07.060
It just doesn't make sense.

12:07.130 --> 12:09.060
None of this does.

12:26.050 --> 12:27.550
I got your call.

12:27.620 --> 12:30.420
Did you get an ID on the dead body in the trunk?

12:30.480 --> 12:32.780
Yeah. Gabriel Cervantes.

12:32.850 --> 12:34.950
28 years young.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.480
And C.O.D. is from stabbing?

12:36.550 --> 12:38.920
Yeah. Multiple wounds to his chest.

12:38.980 --> 12:40.780
Internally bled out.

12:40.850 --> 12:42.150
Ryan's with the suspects,

12:42.220 --> 12:43.980
so I'll let you know what we find out.

12:44.050 --> 12:45.550
Why are you whispering?

12:45.620 --> 12:47.950
That's the victim's daughter down there.

12:48.020 --> 12:50.520
She and her aunt came to the morgue.

12:50.580 --> 12:51.980
She may have seen something.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.000
I thought you'd want to talk to her.

12:54.070 --> 12:56.630
Yeah,I do.

12:56.700 --> 12:58.030
Thank you.

13:08.130 --> 13:10.970
Hi. My name is Calleigh.

13:11.030 --> 13:12.470
I work here.

13:12.530 --> 13:13.800
What's your name?

13:13.870 --> 13:16.300
Emma.

13:16.370 --> 13:19.070
Hi,Emma.

13:19.130 --> 13:23.700
I know that something bad happened today,didn't it?

13:23.770 --> 13:27.830
A man hurt my daddy.

13:32.870 --> 13:36.030
Did you see the man do this?

13:36.100 --> 13:38.930
Yeah.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.430
At our store.

13:40.500 --> 13:43.030
I was hiding.

13:44.430 --> 13:46.930
Come on, everybody pays,right?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.300
Everybody has to kick up.

13:48.370 --> 13:50.370
Come on,you understand.

13:52.970 --> 13:54.900
I'm done paying.

13:54.970 --> 13:57.830
I'm not giving you another dime.

13:57.900 --> 14:01.330
Okay,it's your call. All right?

14:18.130 --> 14:21.100
Did the man see you in your hiding place?

14:21.170 --> 14:24.000
No.

14:26.630 --> 14:30.170
Emma,I want you to know that the man who did this

14:30.230 --> 14:32.300
is not going get away with it.

14:33.970 --> 14:37.730
Do I have to go to a courthouse to look at him again?

14:37.800 --> 14:40.570
No.

14:40.630 --> 14:45.530
My aunt says I might have to.

14:46.970 --> 14:49.230
I won't let that happen.

14:49.300 --> 14:51.000
I promise.

14:59.870 --> 15:01.170
Alexx...

15:01.230 --> 15:04.170
are these his personal effects?

15:04.230 --> 15:06.570
Yes. I was just about to go through them.

15:06.630 --> 15:07.930
I don't see his phone.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.970
The EMS guys said they didn't find one.

15:10.030 --> 15:14.670
They didn't find one.

15:14.730 --> 15:17.770
Does he have a business card?

15:18.870 --> 15:21.100
Never met a lawyer without one.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.130
Russell Tanninger.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.030
All of his numbers are right there.

15:25.100 --> 15:27.670
Thank you.

15:27.730 --> 15:29.500
What's going on,Horatio?

15:29.570 --> 15:32.630
I don't know yet,Alexx.

15:32.700 --> 15:33.700
Thank you.

15:35.700 --> 15:40.370
* *

16:03.500 --> 16:05.730
Ran the swabs from the hands of Craig Edwards,

16:05.800 --> 16:07.230
our homegrown shooter. Okay.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.000
They tested positive for GSR,

16:09.070 --> 16:10.330
so we know he fired a gun,

16:10.400 --> 16:12.770
but negative for selenium-

16:12.830 --> 16:15.300
the trace on the cartridges you found at the scene.

16:15.370 --> 16:17.330
Bottom line: he never touched those cartridges.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.130
So Edwards is not our shooter.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.800
No,but why would a guy

16:20.870 --> 16:23.330
who didn't commit a murder confe to it?

16:23.430 --> 16:24.830
Because if Edwards goes down,

16:24.900 --> 16:27.000
then we stop looking for Sonya's killer,Eric.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.830
So the killer's still out there looking for Sonya?

16:33.670 --> 16:35.870
Sonya?

16:35.930 --> 16:39.030
Listen to me,Sonya.

16:39.100 --> 16:41.430
I know that you are not involved in the shooting.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.600
How do you know for sure?

16:44.670 --> 16:48.030
Sonya,the shooter was after the passenger-

16:48.100 --> 16:50.800
that's you.

16:50.870 --> 16:55.070
Most people in your position would have let them have me.

16:55.130 --> 16:57.470
Sonya,I'm not like most people,

16:57.530 --> 17:00.700
and I want you to come in.

17:00.770 --> 17:04.470
How do I know I can trust you?

17:04.530 --> 17:08.099
Because I'm the only one that can keep you alive,Sonya.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.069
Sonya.

17:22.930 --> 17:25.670
Does he have to have that camera in my face?

17:25.730 --> 17:28.030
It's for educational purposes,Hector.

17:28.099 --> 17:29.600
Say hi to your mommy.

17:31.230 --> 17:33.600
Start from the beginning.

17:33.670 --> 17:36.730
Did you kill Gabriel Cervantes in his bodega?

17:36.800 --> 17:38.070
I didn't kill anybody.

17:38.130 --> 17:40.930
I don't do that.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.770
So you just happened to be driving around

17:42.830 --> 17:44.500
with the guy's dead body in your trunk?

17:44.570 --> 17:47.900
That dead body was in the trunk way before I jacked it.

17:47.970 --> 17:49.270
Oh,now you jacked it?

17:49.330 --> 17:50.770
You jacked it.

17:50.830 --> 17:52.300
Where'd that happen?

17:52.370 --> 17:54.770
On the corner of Eighth and Sola.

17:54.830 --> 17:57.000
<i>This chick was sitting at a stop sign.</i>

17:57.070 --> 17:58.330
I pull her out of the car.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.630
I drove off with it.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.430
Get out of the car.

18:02.500 --> 18:03.970
Get out of the car!

18:04.030 --> 18:05.170
Don't hurt me.

18:05.230 --> 18:06.630
Take it. Take it.

18:06.700 --> 18:09.400
It was the easiest thing I ever copped in my life.

18:09.470 --> 18:10.830
Is this the woman?

18:13.570 --> 18:15.830
Oh,yeah,that's her.

18:15.900 --> 18:17.670
She looked good.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.430
She looked real good. And you know what?

18:19.500 --> 18:21.930
I think she was feeling me.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.670
A lot.

18:23.730 --> 18:25.630
I think she wanted me to hit it.

18:26.700 --> 18:27.870
Yeah.

18:27.930 --> 18:30.870
Wow. Do me a favor.

18:30.930 --> 18:32.770
Take off your jacket.

18:32.830 --> 18:34.030
Why?

18:34.100 --> 18:36.900
Because if you killed Cervantes,

18:36.970 --> 18:40.400
you probably washed your hands,your sleeves.

18:40.470 --> 18:41.730
But I don't think you're smart enough

18:41.800 --> 18:42.900
to know to change your clothes

18:42.970 --> 18:44.670
So,come on, take off the jacket.

18:44.730 --> 18:47.730
Come on. Let's go.

18:56.770 --> 19:00.030
H.,uh,Hector gave us a "last seen" on Sonya.

19:00.100 --> 19:01.900
Hector,the guy who jacked her car?

19:01.970 --> 19:04.330
Yeah. He said it was the corner of Eighth and Sola.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.400
Suspect's a mutt,but I think it's worth taking a look at.

19:06.470 --> 19:07.400
Let's go.

19:07.470 --> 19:08.470
Eighth and Sola.

19:17.130 --> 19:20.170
So this is where Hector said he carjacked Sonya.

19:20.230 --> 19:23.000
So what remains?

19:23.070 --> 19:26.000
Plenty of tire marks. What else?

19:26.070 --> 19:28.300
I don't know,I'm going to canvass the area

19:28.370 --> 19:31.200
for witnesses,see if anyone saw her next move.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.000
Wait a second,Eric.

19:33.070 --> 19:34.230
She was on foot

19:34.300 --> 19:35.700
'cause she was carjacked,right?

19:35.770 --> 19:36.730
That's right.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.500
Maybe she rented a car.

19:38.570 --> 19:40.930
Excuse me?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.270
Excuse me,sir, can we talk to you?

19:43.330 --> 19:44.470
Can I help you?

19:44.530 --> 19:45.630
I hope so.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.100
Have you seen this woman? Sure have.

19:47.170 --> 19:49.300
She rented a truck from me a couple hours ago.

19:49.370 --> 19:50.770
Say where she was going?

19:50.830 --> 19:52.130
No,she didn't.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.870
I don't think she wanted me to know either.

19:53.930 --> 19:55.430
Why do you say that?

19:55.500 --> 19:57.700
She asked me for an Escalade with tinted windows.

19:57.770 --> 19:59.730
Made sure the GPS wasn't attached.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.770
I'm going to need a copy of that security tape up there.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.730
I'm going to have to ask my manager,man.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.630
There won't be time.

20:10.700 --> 20:14.230
* *

20:16.830 --> 20:19.300
Talk me through what you're doing.

20:19.370 --> 20:23.200
Okay,this is the jacket worn by our suspect,Hector Rivera.

20:23.270 --> 20:26.100
We believe that he stabbed Gabriel Cervantes,

20:26.170 --> 20:29.400
so I'm going to run what's called a luminol test.

20:29.470 --> 20:30.800
What's luminol?

20:30.870 --> 20:33.470
Luminol is a compound that, when it interacts

20:33.530 --> 20:35.130
with the iron in hemoglobin, uh...

20:35.200 --> 20:36.530
Oh,you're there.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.830
Luminol is a compound that, when it interacts

20:38.900 --> 20:41.600
with the iron in hemoglobin, will,uh,luminesce.

20:41.670 --> 20:42.970
You mean blood?

20:43.030 --> 20:45.870
Yeah. Nothing vanishes without a trace,

20:45.930 --> 20:48.270
especially... blood.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.130
Stabbings are very bloody,

20:50.200 --> 20:53.500
so if there is blood on this jacket,

20:53.570 --> 20:55.870
the luminol will cause it to glow.

20:55.930 --> 20:58.270
Oh,cool.

20:58.330 --> 21:02.830
Another,uh,word for it is,uh,"evidence. "

21:02.900 --> 21:05.000
Can we even can get that to be even brighter?

21:05.070 --> 21:07.200
Okay,I just want it to really pop on film.

21:07.270 --> 21:09.600
Yeah,give me a sec.

21:14.330 --> 21:16.030
Oh,yeah,that's my money shot.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.500
Yeah,it's,uh,it's mine,too.

21:17.570 --> 21:19.930
So we just got to get this to the DNA lab,

21:20.000 --> 21:24.100
have them confirm it is our victim's blood,

21:24.170 --> 21:28.370
and then,um... case closed.

21:32.600 --> 21:36.670
Hey,Valera,what'd you get from Hector's jacket?

21:36.730 --> 21:39.800
Would you mind turning the camera off?

21:39.870 --> 21:40.970
Come on,don't be shy.

21:41.030 --> 21:42.470
We're doing a public service.

21:42.530 --> 21:44.830
Seriously,Ryan, turn it off.

21:44.900 --> 21:49.300
He's,uh,he's harmless, so don't worry about him.

21:49.370 --> 21:51.700
Okay,suit yourself.

21:51.770 --> 21:53.370
My results are zero. Zip.

21:53.430 --> 21:55.070
There's no DNA on the jacket.

21:55.130 --> 21:57.100
I don't see how that's possible.

21:57.170 --> 21:59.030
The luminol gave a significant blood spatter.

21:59.100 --> 22:02.770
It was actually,uh... more than significant.

22:02.830 --> 22:04.500
You should have seen it glow. It was amazing.

22:04.570 --> 22:05.870
Oh,I bet it was.

22:05.930 --> 22:07.970
The problem,is,the more luminol you spray,

22:08.030 --> 22:09.770
the more you dilute the blood.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.870
Okay. All right. I get it.

22:21.930 --> 22:23.530
So what have we really got here?

22:23.600 --> 22:25.570
Ryan,too much luminol.

22:25.630 --> 22:28.370
There's no DNA.

22:28.430 --> 22:31.170
What do you mean?

22:31.230 --> 22:32.600
If you want to get this guy,

22:32.670 --> 22:34.300
you're gonna have to find some other way.

22:42.970 --> 22:45.570
You're gonna have to get that thing out of my face.

22:45.630 --> 22:47.300
Get it out of my face.

23:00.630 --> 23:01.900
Is this Gabriel Cervantes?

23:01.970 --> 23:03.930
It's the guy from the trunk,yeah.

23:05.030 --> 23:08.670
I don't know if,uh...

23:08.730 --> 23:09.870
you heard.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.170
That you compromised the only evidence

23:11.230 --> 23:12.400
linking the killer to the victim?

23:12.470 --> 23:13.770
Yeah,I heard.

23:13.830 --> 23:14.870
Look,I don't want an explanation.

23:14.930 --> 23:16.030
Let's just find something

23:16.100 --> 23:18.200
to link it to the driver,Hector.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.130
Trunk guy likes his tats,huh?

23:25.200 --> 23:28.870
Three skulls... cross...

23:28.930 --> 23:30.300
Anything unique?

23:30.370 --> 23:33.330
Alexx says the cross tattoo is new.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.730
Mmm. Yeah. Looks raw.

23:35.800 --> 23:38.070
Mr. Cervantes has the markings of a rough life.

23:38.130 --> 23:39.700
Let's see if we can find a way

23:39.770 --> 23:41.330
to tie Hector to it.

23:41.400 --> 23:44.630
What are the chances of these helping bust Hector?

23:46.070 --> 23:48.530
For your sake,hope high.

23:53.430 --> 23:55.770
When you were on gang detail, did you see any of these tats?

23:55.830 --> 23:59.730
Oh,yeah. Your guy was definitely in a gang.

23:59.800 --> 24:00.800
Los Craneos.

24:00.870 --> 24:02.600
The Skulls. That's cute.

24:02.670 --> 24:04.170
They left a bloody trail from Miami

24:04.230 --> 24:06.170
all the way down the turnpike.

24:06.230 --> 24:07.370
What's his name?

24:07.430 --> 24:09.130
Gabriel Cervantes.

24:09.200 --> 24:10.570
Ooh.

24:10.630 --> 24:11.700
Fresh tat.

24:11.770 --> 24:13.170
Couple of days old.

24:13.230 --> 24:15.200
Might as well have had a target on his chest.

24:15.270 --> 24:16.300
What do you mean?

24:16.370 --> 24:17.300
Well,it's a cross.

24:17.370 --> 24:18.900
It means he gave up the life.

24:20.600 --> 24:21.530
Yeah.

24:21.600 --> 24:22.870
He was trying to go straight.

24:22.930 --> 24:24.270
Bought a little bodega.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.970
He's got a... he's got a little girl.

24:26.030 --> 24:27.370
Well,if he'd gone straight,

24:27.430 --> 24:28.530
that's an automatic death sentence.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.000
as far as the gang's concerned.

24:30.070 --> 24:31.230
You think someone could be pulling

24:31.300 --> 24:32.770
the strings from the inside?

24:32.830 --> 24:34.530
Yeah,you're gonna want to talk to Rulon Domingo.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.400
He's the top Craneo shot- caller in Miami-West Prison.

24:37.470 --> 24:39.330
He is one cold bastard.

24:39.400 --> 24:43.700
Well,he's about to get a temporary release.

24:53.970 --> 24:55.900
Mr. Domingo,are you familiar

24:55.970 --> 24:59.430
with a man named Gabriel Cervantes?

25:04.900 --> 25:09.470
I'm doing three life sentences, little one.

25:09.530 --> 25:10.900
You know what that means?

25:10.970 --> 25:12.870
Means you got nothing to lose by talking to me.

25:12.930 --> 25:17.170
Gabriel Cervantes is dead.

25:17.230 --> 25:19.270
Do you have any idea why?

25:21.930 --> 25:24.070
Gabriel turned his back on us.

25:24.130 --> 25:25.730
Went straight.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.500
Because he bought a bodega and wouldn't give you kickbacks?

25:28.570 --> 25:30.230
Is that why you had Hector kill him?

25:30.300 --> 25:32.930
I ain't copping to nothing.

25:34.470 --> 25:35.670
Look...

25:38.470 --> 25:40.530
I know that we can shackle your hands.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.200
We can remove you from society,

25:42.270 --> 25:45.330
but I can tell that your arms have a very long reach.

25:47.130 --> 25:48.370
You're already in for life.

25:48.430 --> 25:50.700
What's one more count of murder?

26:07.130 --> 26:10.770
Yeah. I gave the okay on Gabriel.

26:10.830 --> 26:13.000
Had Hector do it.

26:13.070 --> 26:14.870
He's a good soldier.

26:14.930 --> 26:18.970
When you talk to Hector, you tell him he made his bones.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.100
I'll tell you what.

26:22.170 --> 26:24.670
I'm going to let you tell him yourself.

26:38.700 --> 26:41.100
So,you get anything on these security tapes?

26:41.170 --> 26:42.800
From the corner where Sonya was carjacked?

26:42.870 --> 26:43.870
Haven't gotten to it yet.

26:43.930 --> 26:45.400
Something else took precedence.

26:46.670 --> 26:48.270
All right,well, this better be good,Coop.

26:48.330 --> 26:49.700
Dead lawyer's cell phone.

26:49.770 --> 26:51.700
H told me to try it since Sonya hung up on him.

26:51.770 --> 26:54.000
And? And she just got back on-line.

26:54.070 --> 26:55.300
All right, bring up a grid.

26:55.370 --> 26:57.600
Already on it.

26:57.670 --> 27:00.030
Can you locate the signal?

27:01.030 --> 27:02.900
There she is.

27:02.970 --> 27:05.030
What I don't get is why Sonya would keep this cell phone.

27:05.100 --> 27:06.830
The important thing is that she has it.

27:08.400 --> 27:09.870
Give me something I can tell H.

27:09.930 --> 27:11.370
Great thing about global positioning,Delko.

27:11.430 --> 27:14.770
Lets me deliver you... to her.

29:12.580 --> 29:15.480
Wrong.

29:16.520 --> 29:17.980
So...

29:19.020 --> 29:20.620
Where's Sonya?

29:20.680 --> 29:22.150
She turned on us.

29:22.220 --> 29:23.420
She betrayed the cause.

29:23.480 --> 29:25.920
You're Al-Qadr?

29:25.980 --> 29:28.580
Two weeks ago,we had a truck headed to the Everglades,

29:28.650 --> 29:32.150
financed by her, to blow up a nuclear plant.

29:32.220 --> 29:33.920
And suddenly you were there.

29:33.980 --> 29:37.620
She betrayed all of Al-Qadr.

29:45.320 --> 29:48.080
Call him an ambulance.

30:07.250 --> 30:09.580
Frank.

30:14.420 --> 30:16.850
She's alive,Frank.

30:16.920 --> 30:20.020
He say anything about Sonya? Yeah,he,uh...

30:20.080 --> 30:21.620
he thinks she's one of us.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.320
Fat chance.

30:23.380 --> 30:25.450
She planned that explosion a few weeks back,

30:25.520 --> 30:27.480
got us to this warehouse to get us killed.

30:27.550 --> 30:28.920
We got to find her,Frank.

30:28.980 --> 30:30.150
Find her right now.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.620
Did you shake the documentarian?

30:39.680 --> 30:41.720
For now.

30:41.780 --> 30:44.120
What happened to the state attorney?

30:44.180 --> 30:46.420
It,um...

30:46.480 --> 30:49.050
looks like we're going to need Emma to testimony.

30:49.120 --> 30:52.380
No,I nailed Rulon's admission down myself.

30:52.450 --> 30:54.920
It's just the State feels that a jury isn't really

30:54.980 --> 30:58.450
going to respond well to a... to a three-time lifer.

30:58.520 --> 31:00.250
Now,she did see him kill her Dad.

31:00.320 --> 31:01.950
She's going to be able to ID him.

31:02.020 --> 31:03.350
Absolutely not,forget it.

31:03.420 --> 31:05.280
All she's going to have to do is put it on tape.

31:05.350 --> 31:06.880
I really feel like,uh,

31:06.950 --> 31:08.520
like they're going to be able to protect her.

31:08.580 --> 31:09.920
Are you kidding me?

31:09.980 --> 31:11.320
They don't even know she exists.

31:11.380 --> 31:13.180
You really think I want to tell a gang

31:13.250 --> 31:14.420
that she witnessed their murder?

31:14.480 --> 31:16.220
No.

31:16.280 --> 31:19.050
Okay,let's find another way.

31:21.420 --> 31:23.950
Is this the rental agency tape?

31:24.020 --> 31:25.420
Where Sonya was carjacked?

31:25.480 --> 31:27.520
Just cued it up.

31:27.580 --> 31:29.750
There's Sonya, inside the Mercedes.

31:30.780 --> 31:33.050
It's a little hard to tell,

31:33.120 --> 31:34.850
but it looks like Hector is opening the door.

31:34.920 --> 31:37.180
Zoom in on it,please.

31:39.420 --> 31:41.420
Let me try something.

31:43.850 --> 31:45.020
She's...

31:45.080 --> 31:46.620
She's smiling.

31:49.620 --> 31:51.180
Nervous response,maybe?

31:51.250 --> 31:54.350
Roll forward.

31:54.420 --> 31:56.650
He's helping her out;

31:56.720 --> 31:58.080
she's handing him those keys.

31:58.150 --> 32:00.220
That's odd behavior for a carjacking.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.520
This was no carjacking.

32:02.580 --> 32:04.580
Hector definitely knew Sonya Barak.

32:04.650 --> 32:06.550
That is a fact.

32:08.580 --> 32:11.550
Mr. Wolfe,is this Hector Rivera's jacket.

32:11.620 --> 32:12.920
Yeah,I've been doing a little overkill.

32:12.980 --> 32:14.750
I'm running sample through the mass spec

32:14.820 --> 32:16.880
trying to tie it to the stabbing at the bodega,

32:16.950 --> 32:19.480
but... I got nothing.

32:21.680 --> 32:23.120
Wait a second.

32:23.180 --> 32:24.550
We may have something bigger-

32:24.620 --> 32:26.120
P. E. T. N.

32:26.180 --> 32:27.650
P. E. T. N.? What's that?

32:27.720 --> 32:30.050
Plastic explosive,Mr. Wolfe.

32:30.120 --> 32:32.380
There were traces of nitropyrene.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.580
That's... diesel exhaust.

32:34.650 --> 32:36.580
Those are the same components that were found

32:36.650 --> 32:39.250
on the truck that was going to the power plant.

32:39.320 --> 32:40.580
The truck we stopped.

32:40.650 --> 32:42.880
But the driver died in that explosion.

32:42.950 --> 32:45.520
And we never knew who loaded it till now.

32:49.580 --> 32:51.450
Hector,you didn't carjack Sonya.

32:51.520 --> 32:53.150
I've got the whole thing on film.

32:53.220 --> 32:54.820
She handed you her keys.

32:54.880 --> 32:58.350
And I didn't stab that dude in the car trunk,either.

32:58.420 --> 33:02.720
Yes,you did,Hector; and you made a little girl an orphan.

33:02.780 --> 33:04.350
Prove it.

33:04.420 --> 33:06.220
I've got you for loading explosives

33:06.280 --> 33:07.780
onto an Al-Qadr truck.

33:07.850 --> 33:09.820
Trace from your jacket ties you to the payload,

33:09.880 --> 33:11.350
so don't lie to me.

33:18.180 --> 33:20.650
It's a job,man,okay?

33:20.720 --> 33:22.950
It's not like I'm a terrorist, all right?

33:23.020 --> 33:24.250
I'm just a player.

33:24.320 --> 33:25.750
I'm just trying to get my hustle on.

33:25.820 --> 33:27.350
I'm in it for the money. Where's Sonya?

33:27.420 --> 33:30.820
Last I heard,I don't know.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.880
Hector,I'm going to cover it again.

33:32.950 --> 33:35.020
Where's Sonya?

33:39.980 --> 33:41.850
I have no idea.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.980
She called me this morning, and I had to meet her downtown.

33:49.720 --> 33:51.180
How you doing?

33:53.420 --> 33:55.420
Oh,you're just going to give me this car?

33:55.480 --> 33:57.350
Someone from Al-Qadr shot my lawyer.

33:57.420 --> 33:58.820
I don't want to be implicated.

33:58.880 --> 34:00.150
So this car is hot?

34:00.220 --> 34:01.650
Dump it if you have to.

34:01.720 --> 34:04.520
And remember, you never saw me.

34:04.580 --> 34:07.080
All right,you know, I got you.

34:12.780 --> 34:15.150
I already had to dump a body,

34:15.219 --> 34:17.420
so I figured I'd kill two birds in one stone.

34:17.480 --> 34:20.880
Under the Patriot Act,this is your last hour of freedom.

34:20.949 --> 34:22.550
What do you want to do?

34:34.580 --> 34:36.280
Let's make a deal.

34:36.350 --> 34:38.050
Maybe I can help you find Sonya.

34:38.120 --> 34:41.050
You had your chance,Hector. No deal.

34:44.719 --> 34:45.850
You're looking for that little girl,

34:45.920 --> 34:47.480
Emma Cervantes,aren't you?

34:47.550 --> 34:49.420
Went missing after the lab lost evidence.

34:49.480 --> 34:50.750
She's your star witness,right?

34:50.820 --> 34:52.080
Have to find her first.

34:52.150 --> 34:54.050
But you need... you need... you need her testimony

34:54.120 --> 34:55.719
to put the father's killer away,right?

34:55.780 --> 34:57.380
Nope. Just put him away for life

34:57.450 --> 34:58.550
on a charge of sedition.

34:58.620 --> 34:59.820
The little girl doesn't know that?

34:59.880 --> 35:01.050
It's none of your business.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.450
It'd be great to see you tell her

35:02.520 --> 35:03.680
you put Hector away.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.020
Sorry. Elevator's full.?

35:16.500 --> 35:18.000
Emma?

35:26.160 --> 35:27.660
Emma?

35:33.830 --> 35:36.600
Emma,it's safe to come out.

35:36.660 --> 35:38.430
Did you get him?

35:38.500 --> 35:40.260
We did.

35:40.330 --> 35:42.700
The man in the jacket?

35:42.760 --> 35:45.100
We got the man in the jacket.

35:46.130 --> 35:48.130
I was scared.

35:48.200 --> 35:51.660
I think that's a very brave thing to admit.

35:52.660 --> 35:54.060
You're safe now.

35:54.130 --> 35:56.630
Okay?

35:56.700 --> 35:58.860
Do I need to talk in court?

35:58.930 --> 36:01.200
No. You don't need to talk

36:01.260 --> 36:03.300
to anybody if you don't want to.

36:05.930 --> 36:09.030
Can I talk to you?

36:10.060 --> 36:12.730
Of course.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.200
You can talk to me about anything you want.

37:30.060 --> 37:32.060
* *

37:37.560 --> 37:40.400
H. Nafi's weapon from the warehouse?

37:42.800 --> 37:45.730
Yes,he left me a clear print and the striations

37:45.800 --> 37:47.760
match the round that killed Tanninger.

37:47.830 --> 37:51.100
Courthouse. Warehouse. Nafi's been busy today.

37:51.160 --> 37:52.760
I'll have him brought up from booking.

37:52.830 --> 37:54.330
There's one other thing,Eric.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.660
What's that? I found a smear of blood on the slide

37:56.730 --> 37:58.930
and I want to match it to another suspect.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.030
Who?

38:10.800 --> 38:12.500
I don't understand.

38:12.560 --> 38:13.800
What are striations?

38:13.860 --> 38:16.230
Striations tell us that the handgun we recovered

38:16.300 --> 38:19.200
at the warehouse was used to kill the defense attorney.

38:26.830 --> 38:28.460
So the gun was used.

38:28.530 --> 38:30.400
But you have nothing to tie my client

38:30.460 --> 38:31.560
to the murder of Russell Tanninger.

38:31.630 --> 38:33.030
And I have no desire to,

38:33.100 --> 38:34.760
Mr. Fremont.

38:35.800 --> 38:37.430
DNA spectra.

38:39.130 --> 38:41.560
DNA spectra

38:41.630 --> 38:43.600
confirming...

38:43.660 --> 38:45.530
that you,Mr. Fremont...

38:45.600 --> 38:48.760
you killed Mr. Tanninger.

38:48.830 --> 38:50.630
Oh,this is just-

38:50.700 --> 38:53.260
this is just typical government B.S.

38:53.330 --> 38:54.660
You can't get a "terrorist",

38:54.730 --> 38:55.830
so you go after the attorney.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.830
You're a part of this.

38:57.900 --> 39:00.260
You're Al-Qadr,aren't you?

39:04.200 --> 39:07.160
You got a slide bite when you shot Tanninger.

39:16.730 --> 39:18.700
Your problem is the bullet ricocheted

39:18.760 --> 39:20.000
when you missed Sonya.

39:20.060 --> 39:22.130
Lucky for us, your DNA's in the system

39:22.200 --> 39:23.400
on an old assault charge.

39:23.460 --> 39:25.100
And Mr. Nafi didn't notice

39:25.160 --> 39:27.230
the blood on the weapon when you handed it to him,

39:27.300 --> 39:28.400
did you,Mr. Nafi?

39:30.200 --> 39:31.460
You tried to set me up?

39:31.530 --> 39:33.000
Shut up.

39:33.060 --> 39:36.000
You gave me this gun to kill Sonya.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.300
We know where Sonya is.

39:42.460 --> 39:44.300
Do what you have to do.

39:49.260 --> 39:51.530
Right after his attempt failed this morning.

39:51.600 --> 39:52.860
Isn't that right, Mr. Fremont?

39:55.830 --> 39:57.060
Just stay strong.

39:57.130 --> 39:59.230
We have to be aware of our weakest link.

39:59.300 --> 40:00.530
Sonya set us up.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.160
She didn't set you up.

40:02.230 --> 40:03.660
We didn't need her to.

40:03.730 --> 40:05.330
Book these two animals.

40:09.730 --> 40:11.000
What about Sonya?

40:11.060 --> 40:12.330
There's no sign of her anywhere.

40:12.400 --> 40:13.500
I think she's running out of friends.

40:13.560 --> 40:15.360
She's still got one.

40:20.630 --> 40:22.500
I just spoke to the clerk

40:22.560 --> 40:24.630
in Judge Porterson's courtroom. Okay,who posted bail?

40:24.700 --> 40:26.960
Ready for this? Peter Kinkella.

40:27.030 --> 40:29.100
Is this guy crazy? I mean,she tried to kidnap his family.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.560
What did he use for collateral?

40:30.630 --> 40:31.930
His yacht.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.700
It sounds like Sonya found a new partner.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.430
It certainly does.

40:44.830 --> 40:47.360
Taking a cruise,Mr. Kinkella?

40:52.030 --> 40:53.960
Matter of fact,we are.

40:54.030 --> 40:55.230
Ask Sonya.

40:55.300 --> 40:58.000
We're going to watch the sunset.

40:58.060 --> 40:59.860
Could be your last,Sonya.

40:59.930 --> 41:01.000
What?

41:01.060 --> 41:02.760
Why don't you tell her,Peter?

41:02.830 --> 41:05.060
Don't listen to him,Sonya.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.400
He's trying to screw up our cruise.

41:07.460 --> 41:10.430
Sonya,he posted your bail on the hopes

41:10.500 --> 41:11.730
that your people would kill you.

41:11.800 --> 41:13.960
When that failed,he developed his own plan.

41:14.030 --> 41:16.400
That's what today is about,isn't it,Peter?

41:21.030 --> 41:22.730
Peter?

41:26.360 --> 41:28.160
Do you have any idea what it's like

41:28.230 --> 41:30.360
to have your family taken from you?

41:30.430 --> 41:33.400
As a matter of fact, I do,Peter.

41:33.460 --> 41:35.230
Then you understand.

41:35.300 --> 41:37.300
I do understand, but you still have your family.

41:37.360 --> 41:38.400
Go back to them.

41:48.400 --> 41:51.930
I'm telling you, this woman is evil.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.200
Then get out while you can.

41:57.360 --> 42:00.460
Peter,this is... this is above your head.

42:00.530 --> 42:03.630
Now I need you to believe me.

42:03.700 --> 42:05.700
Leave now.

42:20.100 --> 42:21.830
Enjoy the sunset.

42:37.330 --> 42:39.430
You venture outside these local waters,

42:39.500 --> 42:40.960
you violate your bail.

42:41.030 --> 42:43.260
I know my boundaries.

42:43.330 --> 42:44.500
Do you?

42:44.560 --> 42:47.600
You have nothing to hold me on,Lieutenant.

42:49.030 --> 42:50.830
I'm free until the trial.

42:50.900 --> 42:52.960
You're still in danger,Sonya.

42:53.030 --> 42:55.330
I can take care of myself.

42:55.400 --> 42:56.800
Can you?

42:56.860 --> 42:59.000
I'll see you in court.

42:59.060 --> 43:01.060
I'll be there.
