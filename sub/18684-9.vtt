00:10.511 --> 00:12.343
Here you go.

00:15.749 --> 00:16.982
Take care, honey.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.816
Bye, aunt gina.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.653
Tell your mom
I'll call her tomorrow.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.022
A bientot.
Au revoir, mademoiselle!

00:59.526 --> 01:00.925
Hello?

01:00.960 --> 01:03.028
Hey, mom, did you get the puppy?

01:03.062 --> 01:04.995
Yes, I got him!

01:05.031 --> 01:06.465
Send me a picture.

01:06.499 --> 01:08.200
Mia, you'll see him soon
enough -

01:08.234 --> 01:09.600
I'll bring him to the station.

01:09.636 --> 01:13.070
Mom, please! All right.

01:13.106 --> 01:15.641
Bear! Bear!

01:17.611 --> 01:20.311
He's the cutest thing ever.

01:32.525 --> 01:35.727
Les voyageurs sur 10,
sur le train plate-forme 3,

01:35.763 --> 01:38.764
Dpart dans 15 minutes.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.707
Les voyageurs de I'express 10,

01:48.742 --> 01:50.942
Embarquez sur le train
sur la voie 3.

01:50.977 --> 01:53.244
Dpart dans 15 minutes.

02:11.065 --> 02:12.496
Bear, come. Come, come on.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.968
Come on.

02:21.674 --> 02:24.243
Come on, mia. Pick up!

02:24.278 --> 02:26.178
Come on, now. Come-come.
Come. Come.

02:26.213 --> 02:28.881
Come on, sweetheart.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.684
Excuse me!

02:32.720 --> 02:35.053
This is a direct train
from entrevaux, madam.

02:35.089 --> 02:37.522
Doors and windows
lock automatically.

02:37.558 --> 02:41.459
If you try to open the door?
Beep! The alarm sounds.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.127
You can't get off.

02:43.162 --> 02:46.064
But she was on this train,
I spoke to her!

02:46.100 --> 02:49.000
Then you must have missed
her on the platform.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.601
She's probably on her way home.

02:50.637 --> 02:53.304
No, no. She knew
that I was meeting her.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.472
Where is my daughter?

03:30.010 --> 03:31.910
Where is she?

03:58.488 --> 04:00.655
Thanks for ageing to meet
with us, mr. Beaumont.

04:00.691 --> 04:02.157
We hear you're the best.

04:02.192 --> 04:04.259
And the police haven't found
a lead yet.

04:05.262 --> 04:07.562
Did you just recently
announce this reward money?

04:07.597 --> 04:10.065
Yeah. It was last week.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.499
To be honest we're frustrated.

04:11.535 --> 04:12.834
With the investigation.

04:12.869 --> 04:15.136
So we re-mortgaged the house
to raise the reward money.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.005
And then this arrived
on our doorstep.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.839
As soon as we put up
the posters.

04:24.047 --> 04:26.348
Well, it certainly looks
like mia.

04:30.087 --> 04:31.886
"I know what happened to her."

04:31.922 --> 04:34.589
Fan bar, 4 p.M. Friday.

04:34.624 --> 04:38.660
"No cops or I don't show.
Wear the hat."

04:38.695 --> 04:41.062
That's in a few hours.

04:41.098 --> 04:42.775
This is the first sign
we've had in six months

04:42.799 --> 04:45.166
Mia is even alive.

04:46.970 --> 04:49.637
What? Well, we don't know.

04:49.673 --> 04:51.706
When this picture was taken,
mrs. Crockett.

04:51.742 --> 04:52.985
It could've been six months ago.

04:53.009 --> 04:54.776
So she could be dead.
No one's saying that.

04:54.811 --> 04:56.711
But we do need proof of life.

04:56.747 --> 04:57.946
When mia first went missing,

04:57.981 --> 04:59.414
We paid out ten grand
to scammers.

04:59.449 --> 05:00.982
Who turned out to be in russia.

05:01.017 --> 05:02.784
We need to know
if this is for real.

05:02.819 --> 05:05.420
Well, we should find that out
when I meet whoever sent this.

05:19.970 --> 05:21.803
Excuse me.

05:21.838 --> 05:24.239
Okay. We got anything?

05:24.274 --> 05:26.341
Well, witnesses place mia
in the front carriage,

05:26.376 --> 05:28.376
But her suitcase and guitar
were found in the back,

05:28.412 --> 05:29.844
Along with her phone.

05:29.880 --> 05:31.913
Well, no teenager leaves
her phone.

05:31.948 --> 05:34.215
How could she get off
a moving train?

05:34.251 --> 05:37.385
When the stain stops moving,
I guess, right?

05:37.421 --> 05:39.621
But then the station cctv
would've shown her.

05:39.656 --> 05:42.924
Getting off the platform. Right.

05:42.959 --> 05:45.894
Unless she didn't.

05:47.030 --> 05:49.464
60 passengers got off
the train in menton.

05:49.499 --> 05:51.366
Not one of them was mia.

05:53.003 --> 05:56.638
Okay. What are you looking
at here?

05:56.673 --> 06:00.175
Maybe she didn't get off at all.

06:08.251 --> 06:10.318
This is her, last year.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.792
Wow, she is so talented.

06:17.828 --> 06:19.794
Carlo got her that guitar
in spain.

06:19.830 --> 06:22.464
I gather he's mia's step-father.

06:22.499 --> 06:26.401
Yeah, but-but he's really
her dad.

06:26.436 --> 06:29.471
She hasn't seen her biological
father since we left detroit.

06:29.506 --> 06:32.974
Good boy, bear.

06:33.009 --> 06:34.609
Good boy.

06:34.644 --> 06:35.944
He wants out.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.313
We finally got this rascal
house-trained.

06:38.348 --> 06:40.682
He so sweet. How old is he?

06:40.717 --> 06:42.283
Eight months.

06:42.319 --> 06:45.487
He was a gift for mia,
she never even got to see him.

06:45.522 --> 06:46.921
She didn't pick him out?

06:46.957 --> 06:49.157
No, she insisted I get him
while she was at my sister's,

06:49.192 --> 06:51.993
So that he'd be here
when she got back.

06:52.028 --> 06:53.528
Mia spent every summer.

06:53.563 --> 06:55.330
At your sister's place
in entrevaux...

06:55.365 --> 06:58.132
She could ride horses
there all day long.

06:59.469 --> 07:03.071
It's a 90-minute trip,
there were no stops.

07:03.106 --> 07:05.440
I-I don't understand why
someone would take her.

07:05.475 --> 07:07.308
From a moving train.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.110
We have your sister's address?

07:09.145 --> 07:11.045
I'd like my investigator,
zara hallam,

07:11.081 --> 07:12.380
And oliver yates, my profiler,

07:12.415 --> 07:13.948
To speak with her. Of course.

07:13.984 --> 07:15.683
If you think it would help.

07:15.719 --> 07:17.218
It could.

07:23.727 --> 07:26.160
There is no way a person
could hide in this thing.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.730
Well, so much for being
rolled out.

07:28.765 --> 07:31.165
Does this train go back
to entrevaux, after?

07:31.201 --> 07:33.601
No, monsieur, this is the
last train on this line.

07:33.637 --> 07:35.136
So where does it go after
menton?

07:35.171 --> 07:36.938
Menton.

07:36.973 --> 07:39.641
Into a garage - till morning.

07:50.420 --> 07:51.986
Can you get in there?

07:52.022 --> 07:53.087
Me? Yeah.

07:54.324 --> 07:56.824
You're about mia's size.

08:08.371 --> 08:10.004
Et voilÃ.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.640
Can you close it?

08:21.051 --> 08:22.817
Can I come out now?

08:22.852 --> 08:25.153
Well, you have to do it
yourself.

08:25.188 --> 08:27.288
Ever the gentleman.

08:27.324 --> 08:30.592
To see if it's possible,
houdini.

08:40.470 --> 08:41.803
It's possible.

08:41.837 --> 08:43.816
Then it's probable - since
this is the only possibility.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.473
Anyone's ever found.

08:45.508 --> 08:47.575
So she wasn't taken,
she run away.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.877
But what was she running from?

08:58.388 --> 09:00.822
He's not afraid of being
seen in a public place.

09:00.857 --> 09:03.257
That's if he shows up.
Could be another scam.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.226
Yeah. Let's hope not.

09:06.663 --> 09:08.029
Bonjour.

09:08.064 --> 09:10.565
Une pression, s'il vous plaÃ®t.

09:13.136 --> 09:16.337
No cctv, inside or out.

09:16.373 --> 09:17.639
Merci. Bien.

09:17.674 --> 09:21.576
No worries. I've got a
stunning visual on your beer.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.246
So now what?

09:25.281 --> 09:27.482
Well, now we sit and wait.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.057
Wait, he's calling.

09:37.193 --> 09:39.394
Someone just slipped
a phone into my pocket.

09:39.429 --> 09:41.629
I may have to go off-line
for a while.

09:41.665 --> 09:42.997
What? Why?

09:43.033 --> 09:45.193
Well, I guess someone wants
to show me who's in charge.

09:46.436 --> 09:49.704
Hello?

09:49.739 --> 09:51.839
Drop your tech in the beer.

09:51.875 --> 09:55.510
No one listens,
no one records me.

09:55.545 --> 09:59.414
Eric? There. Done.

10:01.418 --> 10:03.951
And the button cam, too.

10:06.556 --> 10:08.222
All right.

10:11.594 --> 10:13.494
Done! Crap!

10:14.731 --> 10:16.731
Is that normal?

10:16.766 --> 10:18.433
Um, n-not exactly.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.569
Walk through
the door behind you,

10:21.604 --> 10:23.104
Into the back room.

10:28.178 --> 10:30.878
That's it. Just keep walking
straight ahead.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.387
Yeah. Keep going.

10:40.457 --> 10:42.590
Turn left as you go in.

10:46.196 --> 10:48.196
Keep still.

10:51.835 --> 10:53.868
I usually I insist
on dinner first.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.369
I don't carry a weapon.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.238
I would if I were you.

10:57.273 --> 10:58.884
Carrying a gun actually
increases your risk.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.175
Of getting killed.
So does being born.

11:01.211 --> 11:03.478
Shoes...

11:04.881 --> 11:07.048
Take them off.

11:09.385 --> 11:10.785
You're not mia's father.

11:10.820 --> 11:12.954
I'm a negotiator hired
by mia's parents.

11:12.989 --> 11:14.856
Eric beaumont.

11:14.891 --> 11:17.859
Eric beaumont...? Have we met?

11:17.894 --> 11:20.595
Sit down, mr. Beaumont.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.274
Sant.

11:36.246 --> 11:39.147
That's nice and cold.

11:39.182 --> 11:41.449
Your note said you know what
happened to mia crockett.

11:41.484 --> 11:44.152
That's right.

11:44.187 --> 11:46.354
I'm listening.

11:52.428 --> 11:56.964
No, I did not take her,
but I can bring mia home.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.967
For that I'll need half of
the reward money up-front -

12:00.003 --> 12:01.636
For costs.

12:01.671 --> 12:03.070
That reward is for information.

12:03.106 --> 12:05.106
On mia's whereabouts.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.775
You just tell us where she is,
and we'll pay you.

12:07.811 --> 12:10.545
I bring her to you.
That's the deal,

12:10.580 --> 12:12.914
Take it or leave it.

12:12.949 --> 12:15.183
Let me be clear you want
half the reward money now...

12:15.218 --> 12:17.985
To bring mia home.
"reformulation."

12:18.021 --> 12:20.388
You're repeating what I said
to build trust.

12:20.423 --> 12:22.790
You seem to know something
about negotiating techniques.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.125
You could say that.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.905
Then you know that mia's
family can't pay anything.

12:25.929 --> 12:28.563
Until they get proof of life.

12:28.598 --> 12:30.231
I sent them the photo, didn't I?

12:30.266 --> 12:32.133
That could've been taken
six months ago.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.169
We need proof that mia
is alive now.

12:39.776 --> 12:41.509
All right.

12:49.477 --> 12:52.011
Eric, are you okay?

12:52.046 --> 12:53.679
Swell.

12:53.714 --> 12:55.726
I'm gonna send a description
of my friend from the bar.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.750
Mid to late 40s,
french national,

12:57.785 --> 13:00.019
Armed and aggressive.
Sounds charming.

13:00.054 --> 13:02.254
He had a military insignia
on a chain around his neck,

13:02.290 --> 13:04.130
Looked like flames.
Can you get zara to run it,

13:04.158 --> 13:05.958
See if oliver can work up
a profile.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.194
Sure. They're at the farm
talking to aunt right now.

13:08.229 --> 13:10.362
What are you gonna do?

13:12.066 --> 13:14.033
I'm gonna go shopping.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.173
Your niece came here
every summer?

13:21.209 --> 13:23.709
Yeah. She loved it here.

13:23.744 --> 13:24.977
I can see why.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.279
This place belonged
to my husband's family -

13:27.315 --> 13:29.748
He died two years ago.

13:31.652 --> 13:34.320
But what has this got to do
with her disappearance.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.554
Probably nothing.

13:35.590 --> 13:38.123
Just helps us create
a complete picture.

13:38.159 --> 13:39.925
Was mia close to her mother?

13:39.961 --> 13:44.697
Very. You know her real dad
walked out 10 years ago.

13:44.732 --> 13:47.099
How did she get along
with her stepfather?

13:48.603 --> 13:52.438
Carlo is a good guy.
He had his wild times,

13:52.473 --> 13:55.608
But he left them back
in detroit.

13:57.979 --> 14:00.346
Thanks for your time.

14:02.083 --> 14:04.049
She says carlo is a good guy,

14:04.085 --> 14:06.051
Yet still mentions his wild
times.

14:06.087 --> 14:08.387
You think it means something?
Not sure.

14:08.422 --> 14:10.155
I could live here.

14:10.191 --> 14:11.523
Oliver yates.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.692
I never pictured you
as a country kind of guy.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.628
Are you kidding me?
I rode horses every weekend.

14:15.663 --> 14:18.230
Until I was like 17.
You did not.

14:18.266 --> 14:20.599
I have a closet full of
trophies to prove it to you.

14:20.635 --> 14:23.068
You look left, you're lying.
There is a bee on you.

14:27.642 --> 14:29.408
Hey, are you in entrevaux?

14:29.443 --> 14:31.977
Yeah, we're just leaving
her aunt gina's now.

14:32.013 --> 14:33.390
Eric made the guy
who sent the photo.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.848
He need you to come back
here and work the profile.

14:35.883 --> 14:38.217
Will do. La gare
d'entrevaux, s'il te plaÃ®t.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.019
Bien sur, madame.

14:50.164 --> 14:51.164
Hey girls,

14:51.198 --> 14:53.465
Any of you into dancing
or singing?

14:53.501 --> 14:55.434
I'm casting a commercial
in cannes next week...

14:55.469 --> 14:56.835
Thank you. Okay.

14:56.871 --> 14:57.903
Can I get a picture?

14:57.939 --> 14:59.138
Thank you. Oui.

14:59.173 --> 15:01.573
Yes.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.208
Beautiful.

15:03.244 --> 15:05.711
Show me those cute little
booties of yours.

15:05.746 --> 15:08.080
Okay. Yeah, beautiful.

15:08.115 --> 15:09.848
Good.

15:09.884 --> 15:11.483
Now, call the number
on the sheet.

15:11.519 --> 15:12.896
And if you get through
the first round,

15:12.920 --> 15:15.321
You get 1000 euros
for a screen test.

15:15.356 --> 15:16.455
Okay. Good bye.

15:22.063 --> 15:23.996
Yeah. Me again.

15:25.766 --> 15:27.499
Mia!

15:27.535 --> 15:28.834
Where is she?

15:29.870 --> 15:31.804
I haven't seen her I told you,

15:31.839 --> 15:34.273
Not since I took that picture
eight months ago.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.308
Who did you take the picture
for, trudi?

15:36.344 --> 15:38.043
Who were you "casting" for?

15:38.079 --> 15:39.678
I don't remember.

15:40.681 --> 15:43.515
I gave you the photo,
now buzz off!

15:43.551 --> 15:45.284
Agh!

15:46.520 --> 15:48.687
Tell me where she is.

15:52.860 --> 15:54.560
Mia wasn't taken
from that train.

15:54.595 --> 15:56.662
We think she hid on it
and snuck off later.

15:56.697 --> 15:59.465
If that's how she got away,

15:59.500 --> 16:01.433
What is she running from?

16:01.469 --> 16:03.535
We checked on mia's step-father.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.838
He has a rap sheet
for assault and battery.

16:05.873 --> 16:07.673
You think she's running
from him?

16:07.708 --> 16:10.342
I'm pretty sure she wasn't
running away from her mother.

16:10.378 --> 16:12.077
Why do you say that?

16:12.113 --> 16:13.924
Well, let's just say, I think
escaping from that train.

16:13.948 --> 16:16.382
Wasn't the only thing
she planned.

16:16.417 --> 16:18.884
The dog?

16:18.919 --> 16:22.321
A teenage girl wants to pick
out her own puppy, unless...

16:23.557 --> 16:25.190
Unless the puppy wasn't for her.

16:25.226 --> 16:26.959
It was for her mother.

16:26.994 --> 16:29.028
To comfort her after
she disappeared.

16:29.063 --> 16:31.430
That's the saddest
thing I ever heard.

16:31.465 --> 16:33.365
The question isn't
just why she ran,

16:33.401 --> 16:35.334
But why she ran like this.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.769
It would've been easier for her.

16:36.804 --> 16:38.303
To slip of her bedroom at night.

16:38.339 --> 16:40.906
She must have plan this
for weeks, months.

16:40.941 --> 16:42.908
So if this was her plan
all along,

16:42.943 --> 16:45.344
Then where is she running to?

16:46.347 --> 16:48.280
Nice kicks, dude.

16:50.184 --> 16:52.384
Surprisingly comfortable.

16:54.255 --> 16:55.821
So eric the medallion
you described.

16:55.856 --> 16:57.689
Around the guys neck
is an insignia.

16:57.725 --> 17:00.025
Worn by members of the french
foreign legion.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.960
I thought that was only
in old movies.

17:01.996 --> 17:05.130
Well, it still exists and
it's a pretty tough outfit.

17:07.768 --> 17:10.402
Can you run the button-cam
video? I have an idea.

17:10.438 --> 17:12.104
He managed to slip a phone
in my pocket.

17:12.138 --> 17:13.972
Right after I sat down.

17:15.209 --> 17:17.076
There was a mirror in front
of me.

17:17.111 --> 17:19.944
We might be able to id him
from the reflection.

17:19.980 --> 17:23.115
There. That him? Mhm. Sure is.

17:23.150 --> 17:26.285
Rewinding.

17:26.319 --> 17:30.122
He turns away right then
so we can't see his face.

17:30.157 --> 17:32.224
This guy is good.
And he wants you to know it.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.593
He knew my name. Recognized
my negotiating technique.

17:34.628 --> 17:36.195
You think he's a professional?

17:36.230 --> 17:39.098
What kind of professional?
Bounty hunter.

17:39.133 --> 17:41.600
Well, if he is,
he'll be easy to find.

17:41.635 --> 17:44.403
Interpol keeps a database
of all active bounty hunters.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.238
Yeah. They're usually
ex-military.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.841
Mercenaries who see themselves
as white knights.

17:48.876 --> 17:51.343
Okay, hold on. That's him.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.980
That's our knight
in shining armor.

17:55.015 --> 17:57.015
Jean-luc larcher...

17:57.051 --> 18:00.686
45, french national,
ex-foreign legion.

18:01.689 --> 18:04.490
Missions in afghanistan
and french guiana.

18:04.525 --> 18:07.993
Where his military career
came to an abrupt end,

18:08.028 --> 18:09.628
Since then he's been
an army of one.

18:09.663 --> 18:11.797
Specializing in slave
retrievals.

18:11.832 --> 18:12.865
Slave retrievals?

18:12.900 --> 18:15.567
Rescuing women abducted
for trafficking.

18:15.603 --> 18:18.737
There are a handful of guys
who make a living like this.

18:23.277 --> 18:25.110
Since 2013,
he's been wanted by interpol.

18:25.146 --> 18:26.778
For questioning about a shooting.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.447
In an austrian brothel.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.115
The girl he was trying to rescue.

18:30.151 --> 18:32.351
Was executed by her kidnappers.

18:32.386 --> 18:35.587
You don't think mia
was trafficked?

18:35.623 --> 18:37.456
What? That he found her
in a brothel?

18:37.491 --> 18:39.625
I hope not. But this
man's armed and dangerous.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.326
If he gets to mia before we do,

18:41.362 --> 18:43.395
He could do more harm than good.

18:43.430 --> 18:45.931
So you're saying mia ran away?

18:45.966 --> 18:47.666
I don't believe it.

18:47.701 --> 18:49.134
I know it's a lot to take in,

18:49.170 --> 18:51.303
But we need to move quickly,
mrs. Crockett,

18:51.338 --> 18:53.005
To get to mia before
this bounty hunter.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.951
Where could she have gone?
Was there a boyfriend,

18:54.975 --> 18:56.608
Girlfriend,
someone she met online?

18:56.644 --> 18:57.910
There was no one.

18:57.945 --> 19:00.279
The police went through
all this, six months ago.

19:00.314 --> 19:03.048
Did you notice a change
in behavior or mood?

19:06.554 --> 19:08.220
Mrs. Crockett?

19:11.458 --> 19:15.294
My husband drowned
in the lake two years ago.

19:15.329 --> 19:16.762
It hit mia pretty hard.

19:16.797 --> 19:18.597
She started writing more songs.

19:18.632 --> 19:20.999
They were-they were beautiful,
but they were sad.

19:21.035 --> 19:23.669
She was playing them for
people, friends at parties.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.304
People on the street.

19:25.339 --> 19:27.506
All right. Let's see if
anyone remembers mia singing.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.409
Talk to street musicians,
try bars with live music.

19:55.970 --> 19:58.003
I saw the poster at the shelter.

19:58.038 --> 20:02.474
I thought about going to the
police, but I was afraid.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.011
Why?

20:07.514 --> 20:09.414
I met a talent scout.

20:09.450 --> 20:11.183
She offered me 1000 euros.

20:11.218 --> 20:15.354
To sing happy birthday
to some billionaire.

20:15.389 --> 20:19.091
She took me to some mansion...
Mia was there.

20:19.126 --> 20:21.293
And what happened?

20:21.328 --> 20:24.029
He wanted us to sleep with him.

20:24.064 --> 20:26.598
But I thought that mia
was living there.

20:26.634 --> 20:29.201
Did you talk to mia? Not much,

20:30.371 --> 20:32.771
But she seemed nervous,
maybe scared.

20:35.876 --> 20:38.277
She told me to get
out while I still could.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.737
Do you remember the name
of the man?

21:06.807 --> 21:09.308
We won't tell the police.

21:09.343 --> 21:11.276
We just wanna find mia.

21:12.379 --> 21:13.879
Rafael.

21:13.914 --> 21:17.282
We all sang "happy birthday
to rafael".

21:20.754 --> 21:23.288
Beau-ti-ful!

21:23.324 --> 21:25.090
Bravo! Bravo!

21:25.125 --> 21:28.327
This little one,
she writes all her own songs.

21:28.362 --> 21:30.095
How about that?

21:31.265 --> 21:33.432
She is going to be a star!

21:42.009 --> 21:44.876
Okay, drink up! It's a party!

21:55.589 --> 21:58.824
I love her voice,
she is amazing.

22:22.516 --> 22:25.417
Two minutes. If he sees you,
he'll kill me.

22:25.452 --> 22:26.918
T'inqui ¨te pas, ma belle.

22:58.002 --> 23:00.636
This is our birthday
boy that charlotte sang to?

23:00.671 --> 23:03.772
Rafael blauch, 56,
hedge-fund billionaire.

23:03.808 --> 23:06.241
Friend to ceos,
senators and royals.

23:06.277 --> 23:08.644
Manipulative, narcissistic.

23:08.679 --> 23:10.379
Charged twice with corrupting
minors.

23:10.414 --> 23:12.080
Both girls settled out of court.

23:12.116 --> 23:14.156
But there were allegations
that he intimidated them.

23:14.185 --> 23:15.751
Into dropping the charges.

23:15.786 --> 23:18.187
I don't care how upset mia
was about her uncle's death.

23:18.222 --> 23:20.856
Why would she wanna be
with this creep?

23:20.891 --> 23:23.258
Well, however she got there,
our bounty hunter, jean-luc,

23:23.294 --> 23:24.960
Apparently knows where she is.

23:24.995 --> 23:27.329
And means to "rescue" her
by force.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.798
Well, let's confront
mr. Pervert billionaire,

23:29.834 --> 23:31.967
Demand to see mia.
Given his record,

23:32.002 --> 23:33.735
He'd probably put her
into hiding.

23:33.771 --> 23:34.970
And if we call the cops?

23:35.005 --> 23:36.605
Well, we have no proof, right?

23:36.640 --> 23:38.807
No evidence said she's being
held against her will.

23:38.843 --> 23:40.876
I can't just do nothing!
Yeah. She's right.

23:40.911 --> 23:42.856
We wait for jean-luc to go
in there, guns blazing,

23:42.880 --> 23:44.413
Someone's bound to get hurt.

23:44.448 --> 23:46.381
Jean-luc.

23:46.417 --> 23:47.983
Says he has proof of life.

23:48.018 --> 23:49.818
He wants me to meet him
back at the bar.

23:53.157 --> 23:54.456
There's your proof of life,

23:54.492 --> 23:56.725
Check the time stamp.
Taken today.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.927
Merci, monsieur larcher.

24:00.097 --> 24:02.097
So you know my name?

24:04.034 --> 24:05.512
If you're thinking
of using that picture.

24:05.536 --> 24:07.870
To find her yourself, don't.

24:09.139 --> 24:10.639
I don't want the reward.

24:10.674 --> 24:12.541
What, you do all this for free?

24:12.576 --> 24:14.476
This time I am.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.579
We're more alike
than you want to admit.

24:17.615 --> 24:21.583
Both of us guns for hire.
Only you carry a gun.

24:30.561 --> 24:32.895
I could shoot you right now.

24:32.930 --> 24:35.264
You could. But you won't.

24:36.433 --> 24:39.535
You're competition. Why not?

24:39.570 --> 24:41.904
Because we both wanna
bring mia home.

24:41.939 --> 24:44.506
So give me my money,
I'll get her.

24:44.542 --> 24:49.077
I just need to show this
picture to her family first.

24:49.113 --> 24:51.113
It's her.

24:51.148 --> 24:53.282
I know you're trying
to stall me, mr. Beaumont.

24:53.317 --> 24:55.317
I'm here to negotiate.

24:56.887 --> 25:00.556
Where mia is,
they don't negotiate.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.327
They did this?

25:05.362 --> 25:07.496
This will happen to mia, too,

25:07.531 --> 25:10.966
Unless I get her out of there.

25:12.970 --> 25:16.405
So let me do my job
and get me my money.

25:24.148 --> 25:25.881
My baby's alive.

25:25.916 --> 25:29.151
She is. But her life's still
at risk.

25:29.186 --> 25:31.753
This bounty hunter, he
doesn't actually have mia.

25:31.789 --> 25:35.490
He means to take her from
blauch's mansion by force.

25:35.526 --> 25:38.226
And we think that could be
extremely dangerous.

25:38.262 --> 25:39.828
So how do we get her back?

25:39.863 --> 25:41.496
Well, we negotiate for her
release.

25:41.532 --> 25:43.498
How? We need leverage.

25:43.534 --> 25:47.469
And with this photo,
we think we have it.

25:47.504 --> 25:49.215
Our billionaire blauch
has had a lot of trouble.

25:49.239 --> 25:53.075
With the authorities,
and yet here they are,

25:53.110 --> 25:55.377
Partying at his home.

25:55.412 --> 25:58.080
This guy's an english duke
set to make billions for blauch.

25:58.115 --> 25:59.848
In an upcoming merger.

25:59.883 --> 26:02.117
And then there is this guy...

26:02.152 --> 26:03.819
Christophe edelman,

26:03.854 --> 26:06.254
Head of regional trading
standards.

26:06.290 --> 26:09.157
Is that useful? Extremely.

26:16.066 --> 26:18.667
Okay, time to trap
a billionaire.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.702
I think he needs a bigger boat.

26:29.113 --> 26:32.881
Have you been trespassing on
my property, mr. Beaumont?

26:32.916 --> 26:35.183
No, mr. Blauch,

26:35.219 --> 26:39.021
But mia crockett has been
missing for six months.

26:40.290 --> 26:42.758
Mia's a big girl.
She can do what she likes.

26:42.793 --> 26:45.093
Well, she was 17 when
she came to your home.

26:45.129 --> 26:47.262
French law forbids the removal
of a minor.

26:47.297 --> 26:49.798
From their parents' authority.

26:50.834 --> 26:52.601
And your point is?

26:53.704 --> 26:56.038
Christophe edelman,

26:57.775 --> 26:59.708
Head of the regional
trading regulatory body,

26:59.743 --> 27:02.044
Currently overseeing
your merger.

27:02.079 --> 27:04.446
By law, he can't be
in the same room with you.

27:04.481 --> 27:07.315
Let alone at a sex party
by your pool.

27:08.852 --> 27:11.053
What has this to do with mia?

27:11.088 --> 27:15.590
Well, you let her go,
and these pictures go away.

27:15.626 --> 27:17.359
Your merger goes through.

27:17.394 --> 27:19.761
And you avoid prison
for insider trading.

27:27.104 --> 27:28.603
I don't do prison.

27:30.941 --> 27:34.209
It's a factor of money,
you see...

27:34.244 --> 27:35.711
Like everything else.

27:35.746 --> 27:38.346
Like pretty girls.

27:40.250 --> 27:42.751
You'd rather lose billions
of euros on your merger,

27:42.786 --> 27:45.320
Than let one girl go home
to her mother?

27:50.861 --> 27:54.096
Carla, show mr. Beaumont.

27:54.131 --> 27:57.065
And ms. Carlson off the boat.

27:59.436 --> 28:02.204
They can collect mia in one hour.

28:02.239 --> 28:05.040
From the promenade des anglais.

28:12.616 --> 28:14.983
She's too old for me, anyway.

28:19.556 --> 28:21.089
I think I need a shower.

28:21.125 --> 28:23.191
Yeah. Well, there is no time
for that now.

28:23.227 --> 28:24.593
Okay. He said we have an hour.

28:24.628 --> 28:26.161
Jean-luc's got eyes
and ears on blauch,

28:26.196 --> 28:28.007
He's gonna think I'm trying
to beat him to the reward.

28:28.031 --> 28:29.898
What are we gonna do?

28:31.502 --> 28:33.368
Get there first.

28:56.894 --> 28:59.261
Carla, go get mia packed.

29:03.233 --> 29:04.800
So do you think this
is gonna work?

29:04.835 --> 29:06.101
Well, a man like blauch.

29:06.136 --> 29:08.570
Isn't just gonna let mia
walk away, she knows too much.

29:08.605 --> 29:10.739
He'll track her down
and silence her for good.

29:10.774 --> 29:12.307
I still don't get it?

29:12.342 --> 29:14.643
How did a girl like mia end
up with a guy like blauch?

29:14.678 --> 29:16.545
He had to have promised her
something.

29:16.580 --> 29:19.080
Maybe blauch offered to help
with her music career.

29:19.116 --> 29:20.315
It had to be more than that.

29:20.350 --> 29:22.684
To make her run away from
her mother and father.

29:22.719 --> 29:25.821
Jean-luc is here, isn't he?
You can bet on it.

29:33.397 --> 29:35.030
So he's gonna be armed?

29:35.065 --> 29:36.865
I'd recon so.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.800
Mia could get caught
in the crossfire.

29:38.836 --> 29:41.770
- So could you.
- Ha.

29:41.805 --> 29:44.239
So our no-gun policy
that's still non negotiable?

29:44.274 --> 29:46.141
Listen, I'll defend myself
if I have to.

29:46.176 --> 29:47.509
You should wait here.

29:47.544 --> 29:49.845
I need you to stay sharp
and alive.

29:50.948 --> 29:52.647
Eric beaumont.

29:52.683 --> 29:55.650
Monte tes mains; Plus haut.

30:05.896 --> 30:07.662
Where are we going?

30:07.698 --> 30:09.497
Well, I am not going anywhere,

30:09.533 --> 30:12.000
But I'm handing you over
to some people.

30:12.035 --> 30:13.268
What people?

30:13.303 --> 30:16.204
I got you a leaving present.

30:16.240 --> 30:19.274
All the songs you recorded here.

30:19.309 --> 30:23.678
So you can be a pop star
like britney spears.

30:23.714 --> 30:27.349
Julia, leave the suitcase and
join us for a moment, please.

30:30.687 --> 30:33.955
Mia, I want you to kiss
julia goodbye.

30:37.594 --> 30:40.562
Come on, it's just a kiss.

30:44.468 --> 30:47.168
On both cheeks.

30:56.914 --> 30:58.413
VoilÃ!

31:04.354 --> 31:06.254
Remember what happens.

31:06.290 --> 31:08.490
To girls who do not behave.

31:14.164 --> 31:15.931
In we go.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.947
Son of a bitch!

31:36.219 --> 31:38.753
Coming here was not the plan.

31:38.789 --> 31:41.823
You may be watched.
It's safer if I take mia now.

31:41.858 --> 31:44.225
Coming to my house
was not the deal.

31:44.261 --> 31:46.061
Okay, we don't have a lot
of time, mr. Blauch.

31:46.096 --> 31:47.529
Let me take her
and I will leave.

31:47.564 --> 31:50.298
A little paranoid,
monsieur beaumont?

31:53.570 --> 31:55.437
Agh!

32:08.485 --> 32:10.618
Agh!

32:11.922 --> 32:14.556
Oof!

32:15.792 --> 32:19.160
Bet you wish you had a gun now.

32:28.238 --> 32:30.071
Oliver, jean-luc grabbed mia.

32:30.107 --> 32:32.273
Blauch is going after them,
we need to find them first.

32:32.309 --> 32:34.142
See if you can track
that vehicle.

32:47.991 --> 32:50.425
What's that? Gps jammer.

32:50.460 --> 32:52.627
Don't want that bad man
following us, do we?

32:54.598 --> 32:57.365
Sir, he's jammed the car's
navigation system.

32:57.401 --> 33:01.302
There's a tracker in the cd!
Use it!

33:03.173 --> 33:04.706
Come on, guys, we're waiting.

33:04.741 --> 33:07.308
Well, there cars gps
is being jammed.

33:08.845 --> 33:10.812
Wait, there is another signal.

33:10.847 --> 33:13.181
That's gotta be a tracker
that blauch planted.

33:13.216 --> 33:14.682
Where is it heading?

33:14.718 --> 33:18.186
It looks like it's heading
towards the woods. Just here.

33:18.221 --> 33:20.021
Okay, send me the coordinates.

33:25.796 --> 33:27.796
That's them. Let's go.

33:59.454 --> 34:01.588
So, are you gonna kill me now?

34:01.623 --> 34:03.423
No.

34:04.826 --> 34:07.560
You can trust me, mia,
I'm not going to hurt you.

34:07.596 --> 34:11.097
I've heard that before
from other men.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.833
No one's going to hurt you,
ever again.

34:16.103 --> 34:19.304
I am jean-luc,
I rescue abducted women.

34:19.341 --> 34:22.308
I record their testimonies,
to help them seek justice.

34:22.344 --> 34:24.744
And avoid retribution.

34:26.047 --> 34:28.447
I am taking you home, mia.

34:46.301 --> 34:48.134
You expect me to make a video?

34:48.170 --> 34:50.303
Yes. You can use it as evidence.

34:50.338 --> 34:52.138
If you choose to prosecute
rafael blauch.

34:52.174 --> 34:55.341
But the answer's no.
He'll hurt me. I know it.

34:55.377 --> 34:57.143
I can't.

35:00.015 --> 35:03.550
Just can't get rid of you,
can I, you back-stabber?

35:03.585 --> 35:05.785
Blauch's man, they're coming
after you, jean-luc.

35:05.821 --> 35:07.987
We found a tracking signal
leading us here.

35:08.023 --> 35:09.722
You came here to help me?

35:09.758 --> 35:13.560
Yes, you need to move.
Right now.

35:27.943 --> 35:30.410
Jean-luc, listen, we gotta go
now. They're coming for her.

35:30.445 --> 35:33.246
And you want me to run?
I want you to live.

35:33.281 --> 35:36.816
You think you're better
than me, but you're not.

35:36.852 --> 35:39.018
We both make a leaving
saving people.

35:39.054 --> 35:40.787
I know you're trying to do
the right thing,

35:40.822 --> 35:42.722
In your own way.

35:43.792 --> 35:45.124
Down!

35:53.935 --> 35:55.768
You see...

36:02.544 --> 36:04.944
Okay, I got you. I got you.

36:04.980 --> 36:07.614
I'll call an ambulance! Yeah.

36:10.886 --> 36:12.819
You bastard.

36:12.854 --> 36:15.255
You're gonna get the reward
after all.

36:15.290 --> 36:17.724
It's yours, pal.

36:18.994 --> 36:20.927
You saved her.

36:22.264 --> 36:24.864
Help is coming.

36:24.900 --> 36:27.200
Just hang in a little longer.

36:27.235 --> 36:29.936
We'll take mia home together.

36:32.474 --> 36:34.641
It's all yours, pal.

36:42.884 --> 36:44.551
I am sorry.

36:59.834 --> 37:01.968
It's okay.

37:13.181 --> 37:17.183
My name is mia crocket
and this is my testimony.

37:17.218 --> 37:21.588
My aunt gina always knew
what my uncle was doing to me.

37:21.623 --> 37:25.992
Two summers ago, I said
I was going to tell my mom...

37:26.027 --> 37:28.428
And they pull my uncle out
of the lake the next day.

37:28.463 --> 37:31.297
He left a note, but my aunt
gina threw it away,

37:31.333 --> 37:34.334
So it would look like
an accident.

37:35.604 --> 37:38.037
She said that it was my fault
he was died.

37:39.608 --> 37:41.708
That I killed him.

37:43.778 --> 37:46.479
She said they'd made videos,

37:46.514 --> 37:48.648
Of me with him.

37:48.683 --> 37:52.085
And that if I told mom
what had happened,

37:52.120 --> 37:54.654
She'd post the videos.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.757
And those images of me
would be there forever.

37:57.792 --> 38:00.893
Then I met a lady who said
she was a talent scout.

38:02.297 --> 38:04.230
She introduced me to rafael.

38:04.265 --> 38:06.666
But he just wanted to use me,

38:07.769 --> 38:09.736
Like my uncle.

38:13.141 --> 38:17.443
And when I tried to go,
he said he'd burn me.

38:18.880 --> 38:21.314
Like he burned julia
when she tried to go.

38:26.421 --> 38:29.088
And then some people rescued me.

38:30.225 --> 38:33.259
And I went somewhere I never
thought I'd be again...

38:35.263 --> 38:37.363
Home.

39:07.295 --> 39:09.996
Hey. You came!

39:10.031 --> 39:11.597
I wouldn't miss it.

39:11.633 --> 39:13.433
Hey, laurie. Hi.

39:20.775 --> 39:23.509
After you testify, you'll
never have to see her again.

39:23.545 --> 39:25.344
She'll pay for what she did.

39:25.380 --> 39:28.081
But rafael blauch
he has an army of lawyers.

39:28.116 --> 39:30.383
Julia and the other girls
are all testifying against him.

39:30.418 --> 39:32.151
And dozens more
have come forward.

39:32.187 --> 39:33.820
All thanks to you, mia.

39:33.855 --> 39:37.290
The other guy,
the one who rescued me.

39:37.325 --> 39:40.126
The police said he did it
just for the money.

39:41.663 --> 39:43.863
You know, I think it was more
than that.

39:43.898 --> 39:46.999
And you? Why do you do it?

39:47.035 --> 39:50.269
Risk your life for people
you don't even know?

39:50.305 --> 39:52.105
I do it for the money.

39:52.140 --> 39:55.341
Then how come you didn't
charge us, mr. Beaumont?

39:55.376 --> 39:56.943
Yeah. Okay. You got me.

39:58.413 --> 40:00.379
Maybe I'll write a song
about it one day.

40:00.415 --> 40:02.448
Maybe you will.

40:05.186 --> 40:07.186
Okay. They're ready for you.

40:07.222 --> 40:08.721
Okay. Come on, honey.
