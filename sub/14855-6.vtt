00:10.726 --> 00:13.217
<i>My name is detective Brett Hopper,</i>

00:13.493 --> 00:15.697
<i>and this is the day
that changes everything...</i>

00:16.116 --> 00:17.108
Put your hands up !

00:17.113 --> 00:19.790
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

00:19.797 --> 00:21.319
<i>I will be framed for murder...</i>

00:22.072 --> 00:23.944
Who the hell are you people ?

00:24.124 --> 00:26.496
<i>My girlfriend Rita
will be in danger.</i>

00:26.501 --> 00:29.356
<i>I know all this because
I am living the same day...</i>

00:29.743 --> 00:31.455
<i>over and over again.</i>

00:31.464 --> 00:34.199
The day is the same
but different things happen.

00:34.230 --> 00:36.796
<i>- Every day, I get another chance.</i>
- For every decision,

00:36.800 --> 00:38.370
there's a consequence.

00:38.374 --> 00:41.469
<i>Garza sent evidence to my sister
Jennifer and me before he died.</i>

00:41.612 --> 00:44.137
<i>I think whoever killed this girl
killed Garza.</i>

00:44.149 --> 00:46.104
<i>My partner Andrea helped me
figure out the clues.</i>

00:46.115 --> 00:49.132
That thing you asked about matched
a guy named Miguel Dominguez.

00:49.148 --> 00:51.636
<i>He's serving five consecutive
life sentences.</i>

00:51.652 --> 00:53.957
<i>My informant Damien may know
something that can help me,</i>

00:53.972 --> 00:55.252
<i>but Rita's ex-husband, Chad</i>

00:55.255 --> 00:56.834
<i>had the most important
information of all.</i>

00:56.838 --> 00:58.284
Where is it ? The murder book,
you have it.

00:58.286 --> 01:00.248
- No, I don't.
- You're lying.

01:00.905 --> 01:03.095
If you're right, the book's
on the front seat of my car.

01:03.111 --> 01:05.131
<i>Now that I have the murder book,
I have to find out</i>

01:05.143 --> 01:07.471
<i>who the girl in the picture is.</i>

01:42.922 --> 01:44.873
That thing you asked about

01:45.097 --> 01:47.444
matched a guy
named Miguel Dominguez.

01:47.591 --> 01:49.427
He's been in Pelican Bay
since'89,

01:49.442 --> 01:52.200
so no way he could have killed
anyone.

02:13.794 --> 02:16.069
Keep that lyin'bitch
in the trunk.

02:16.246 --> 02:18.073
I'll be there.

02:22.280 --> 02:25.124
They got Baxter,
but they can't find Hop.

02:34.736 --> 02:38.224
I meet a chick like that,
she'll be cooking for me in three days.

02:59.011 --> 03:00.225
Whoo !

03:06.436 --> 03:08.195
No, we agreed this be done
a certain way,

03:08.207 --> 03:10.181
and now you're changing
the plans on me. No...

03:10.193 --> 03:11.405
no, I'm not angry.

03:11.422 --> 03:14.264
I just feel like I keep telling you
the same thing over and over.

03:14.845 --> 03:15.970
Bye, mom.

03:19.133 --> 03:20.836
What are you doing here ?

04:05.548 --> 04:08.527
- That was nice.
- That was more than nice.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.394
It's been a while.

04:12.905 --> 04:14.282
A while ?

04:14.343 --> 04:15.815
What was last night ?

04:17.392 --> 04:19.021
No, I'm just saying... I guess...

04:19.035 --> 04:21.541
I guess I just can't get
enough of you.

04:26.188 --> 04:27.814
Oh, no.

04:29.486 --> 04:31.525
Where do you think
you're going ?

04:33.804 --> 04:35.964
I gotta go to the station, pick up
this murder book from this cop

04:35.981 --> 04:37.836
before he leaves for the day.

04:37.841 --> 04:39.928
You're in narcotics.
Why do you need a murder book ?

04:40.219 --> 04:42.640
This cold case that my pops
was working on back in the day

04:42.645 --> 04:45.219
may be connected to something
I'm working on right now.

04:45.282 --> 04:46.440
Your dad ?

04:47.488 --> 04:49.038
That's kind of weird,
huh ?

04:49.052 --> 04:51.425
You and your dad
connected through a murder.

04:51.946 --> 04:54.005
There have been stranger things.

04:57.808 --> 04:59.720
What time you supposed
to go meet this cop ?

04:59.766 --> 05:02.262
I'm not. I'm just gonna
break into his car and take it.

05:03.820 --> 05:05.091
Yeah, right.

05:06.267 --> 05:08.085
I hope they bust you.

05:34.098 --> 05:35.608
How you holding up ?

05:35.941 --> 05:38.868
Eddie wasn't real happy
about rehab, but...

05:39.259 --> 05:41.371
we talked about it.
He knows he needs the help.

05:41.386 --> 05:44.335
- That's good.
- Here's the thing you called about.

05:45.597 --> 05:47.280
Miguel Dominguez.

05:47.285 --> 05:48.979
Gang task force
didn't have much.

05:48.983 --> 05:50.654
This is way too thin
for a guy with five

05:50.670 --> 05:52.421
consecutive life sentences.

05:52.436 --> 05:53.579
Yeah, I know.

05:53.595 --> 05:56.151
It didn't seem right to me, either,
but I checked. That's it.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.292
Hold up.
He's a latin disciple ?

06:01.307 --> 06:03.027
It didn't come up
anywhere I checked.

06:03.042 --> 06:05.743
It's the first tag
G.T.F. puts in the system.

06:05.756 --> 06:07.402
Anybody ask you
why you wanted this ?

06:07.415 --> 06:08.206
No...

06:08.957 --> 06:10.603
but you got me curious.

06:11.654 --> 06:13.452
Is this connected to the L.D. thing

06:13.455 --> 06:15.276
you're working with the feds ?

06:17.571 --> 06:18.928
Yeah, I think so.

06:19.576 --> 06:21.547
And you were gonna
tell me about that one day ?

06:21.898 --> 06:23.725
All  right, you wanna roll
with me on this,

06:23.737 --> 06:26.379
you find out why there's
only two pages on this guy.

06:27.872 --> 06:29.795
I have I.A. In an hour.

06:30.412 --> 06:32.777
- God forbid I keep Shelton waiting.
- Well...

06:32.781 --> 06:34.377
he'll live.

06:35.121 --> 06:36.835
Any leads on the disciples yet ?

06:36.846 --> 06:39.653
I'm about to go chase one down.
Thanks for this.

07:00.007 --> 07:01.317
Where are you going ?

07:04.534 --> 07:05.596
Where is he ?

07:05.772 --> 07:06.938
- I don't know.
- Huh ?

07:06.941 --> 07:09.420
- I don't know. I swear, man.
- Where's Damien ?

07:24.071 --> 07:25.782
You gotta be kidding.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.598
We've got a problem.

07:55.414 --> 07:57.115
Hey, ese, you ain't
got no business here.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.610
Turn around
and keep walking.

07:58.614 --> 08:00.281
My business is with Damien.
Move.

08:00.295 --> 08:02.409
- You're making a big mistake...
- Move.

08:05.876 --> 08:07.387
It's not what you think !

08:07.402 --> 08:08.142
Go !

08:25.890 --> 08:26.790
+

08:28.622 --> 08:30.325
You have no right to be here, Hop.

08:30.366 --> 08:32.232
- This is my family.
- I called.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.899
- You didn't pick up.
- You know what this looks like, huh ?

08:35.085 --> 08:37.323
The lack of respect ?
You coming up in here with a gun ?

08:38.605 --> 08:40.518
My moms is here.

08:40.524 --> 08:41.996
What the hell
is wrong with you ?

08:42.010 --> 08:44.861
I thought you had more sense
than this. You're on the run, D.

08:44.878 --> 08:46.875
There are skinheads out there
looking for you...

08:46.882 --> 08:48.458
You think I'm running, huh ?

08:48.481 --> 08:51.508
I got people looking for me everyday,
Hop. I ain't hidin'from nobody.

08:51.513 --> 08:54.184
And being here is important,
all right ?

08:54.197 --> 08:56.526
I promised my niece I'd make it
to her party, and I keep

08:56.538 --> 08:59.582
my promises.
Something you need to work on.

09:00.108 --> 09:02.327
You lucky I'm here with my family, Hop,
or I'd deal with you myself.

09:02.341 --> 09:04.474
- We need to talk.
- Get up out of here, Hop

09:04.489 --> 09:06.576
before I change my mind
about letting you leave.

09:06.581 --> 09:08.617
Two minutes, outside.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.724
I'm gonna be right back,
all right, loco ?

09:15.740 --> 09:17.567
Let me handle this hura.

09:27.152 --> 09:29.104
Better make it quick, Hop.

09:30.414 --> 09:32.113
I may be your boy, D.,

09:32.223 --> 09:34.338
But I'm not one of your boys.

09:34.929 --> 09:36.642
We straight on that ?

09:37.441 --> 09:39.912
- Oh, I'm gonna remember this.
- Shut up and listen.

09:39.926 --> 09:41.706
Miguel Dominguez...

09:42.333 --> 09:44.753
he's a latin disciple connected to
a murder I'm looking into.

09:44.768 --> 09:46.815
You want me to help you ?

09:47.206 --> 09:49.280
Hop,  you don't get
that kind of love, all right ?

09:49.297 --> 09:51.604
Everything that's happening
to you right now, D. :

09:51.617 --> 09:53.779
the skinheads,
the hit on the safe house...

09:53.785 --> 09:55.793
all goes back to this guy,

09:56.104 --> 09:57.799
to this case.

10:02.423 --> 10:03.925
What's that ?

10:03.961 --> 10:05.355
It's a murder book.

10:05.369 --> 10:07.340
Any info on a murder
goes right in here.

10:07.355 --> 10:09.506
So this is how
you catch bad guys, huh ?

10:09.532 --> 10:10.975
Some of'em.

10:13.022 --> 10:15.464
- Who's this ?
- She's a Jane Doe.

10:15.478 --> 10:17.667
Looks more like a juanita to me.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.923
Look here.
Now this hourglass

10:19.929 --> 10:21.964
was found next to her dead body.

10:22.084 --> 10:24.343
L.D. prints were all over it.

10:24.704 --> 10:27.488
- So go catch'em, Shaft.
- Already been caught.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.567
Dominguez has been doing life,

10:29.571 --> 10:31.227
Pelican Bay, since'89.

10:31.222 --> 10:33.271
Problem is, she was killed in'91.

10:33.289 --> 10:35.076
Well, he's definitely fam.

10:35.484 --> 10:38.143
Old school as hell, but he ain't ringing
no bells. What'd he do ?

10:38.187 --> 10:39.996
Killed his parents in their sleep.

10:39.999 --> 10:42.336
Arrest report said the cops
found him in the kitchen,

10:42.349 --> 10:45.155
- eating on a bowl of cereal, still...
- had all the blood all over him.

10:45.171 --> 10:46.469
So then you do know him ?

10:46.475 --> 10:48.635
Not as no damn Dominguez, bro.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.297
Well, as who ?

10:52.909 --> 10:54.497
Es el Llorón.

10:55.852 --> 10:57.633
"The Crying Man".

10:57.646 --> 10:59.541
We don't talk about him, Hop,

10:59.681 --> 11:02.199
- ever.
- Well, you about to talk right now.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.133
He's the bogeyman.

11:04.150 --> 11:06.540
Someone goes missing,
must be el Llorón.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.736
Kid don't eat his vegetables,
you tell him, el Llorón is coming,

11:08.752 --> 11:10.415
and he cleans his plate.

11:11.025 --> 11:12.364
El llorón...

11:12.369 --> 11:13.744
he's like freddy,

11:13.760 --> 11:15.654
kill you in your dreams.

11:17.298 --> 11:20.555
- This is where she was found ?
- You know it ? L.D. Territory ?

11:20.604 --> 11:22.797
- Nah, man.
- Come on. Don't waste my time, D.

11:22.803 --> 11:25.590
Look, Hop. I got nothing more
to say about el Llorón.

11:28.134 --> 11:30.279
But I might be able
to help you with her.

11:57.711 --> 11:58.560
Hop.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.723
El  madre Magdalena...

12:06.266 --> 12:08.440
está el detective Hopper.

12:08.453 --> 12:10.712
¿Y por qué busca
esa muchacha ?

12:10.717 --> 12:12.839
She wants to know why
you're looking for her.

12:14.715 --> 12:16.780
Tell her I need to know
who she is...

12:16.807 --> 12:18.796
and why she died.

12:18.811 --> 12:21.214
Sólamente quiero saber quien
era la muchacha,

12:21.226 --> 12:23.112
y porque se murió.

12:26.589 --> 12:28.320
Venga conmigo.

12:35.076 --> 12:37.381
The sister's been looking
after immigrants and illegals

12:37.388 --> 12:39.712
since I was growing up.

12:39.727 --> 12:41.747
Somebody goes missing,

12:41.828 --> 12:43.932
the families come to her.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.183
They're all missing ?

13:04.395 --> 13:05.319
Yeah.

13:09.561 --> 13:10.854
I knew her.

13:10.887 --> 13:13.807
She used to live down the street
from me when I was growing up.

13:15.289 --> 13:18.112
Not that many. We should be
out of here in no time, right ?

13:24.254 --> 13:26.320
All right,
where do you wanna start ?

13:30.651 --> 13:33.199
- Just start at the beginning.
- I already told you,

13:33.202 --> 13:35.367
- Brett was with me all night.
- Ms. Shelton,

13:35.379 --> 13:38.233
if we could just go through the night
one more time.

13:38.393 --> 13:40.276
He didn't do this.

13:42.516 --> 13:45.331
He got to my house around 9 :00.
He stopped and got chinese,

13:45.336 --> 13:48.340
we watched a movie
and we went to bed around 11 :30.

13:48.892 --> 13:51.114
Did you fall asleep together ?

13:51.126 --> 13:54.200
I woke up to use the restroom
around 2 :30. He was still asleep.

14:08.007 --> 14:10.197
He was with me all night.

14:13.961 --> 14:15.858
Will you excuse me ?

14:22.068 --> 14:24.948
- She seems pretty credible.
- Why, because she's cute ?

14:25.404 --> 14:28.249
How about because she hasn't flinched
from anything we've asked ?

14:28.519 --> 14:31.910
- I believe her.
- If she's telling the truth, someone's lying.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.085
- Tell him what you told me.
- You ! About to get outta here !

14:35.100 --> 14:38.030
Man, this toy cop over here said
I had some dime bags on me.

14:38.035 --> 14:39.161
Now I did have'em,

14:39.177 --> 14:41.281
but y'all need to let me
back out on the streets,

14:41.294 --> 14:42.836
'cause you know
I'm on the same team.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.379
- Team ?
- Yeah, I been puttin'in work

14:44.392 --> 14:45.924
for Hopper, man.

14:45.937 --> 14:47.542
I'm one of his C.I.'s.

14:47.549 --> 14:49.182
This is what
you brought me here for ?

14:49.196 --> 14:51.695
Matter of fact,
I saw my man this morning.

14:53.540 --> 14:55.178
You saw Hopper today ?

14:55.269 --> 14:56.422
Yeah.

14:58.835 --> 15:00.481
- Let's talk some more. Come on.
- What ?

15:00.485 --> 15:03.289
Oh, come on, man.
I been up here all day.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.594
Yo, Hop, this is way too much work.

15:16.599 --> 15:18.357
Why don't you just tell me
about el Llorón ?

15:18.373 --> 15:19.949
We don't have to mess
with all this.

15:19.952 --> 15:22.240
We're in the basement of a church.
Nobody can hear you.

15:22.247 --> 15:24.725
What, you don't think the devil
ever goes to church ?

15:27.022 --> 15:29.788
¿Por qué un hombre al que buscan
por asesino le importa tanto

15:29.795 --> 15:31.975
encontrar un alma perdida ?

15:32.698 --> 15:35.132
She said, "why does a man
who's wanted for murder

15:35.145 --> 15:37.585
care so much for a lost soul ?"

15:38.387 --> 15:40.472
La policía lo ha estado buscando.

15:41.850 --> 15:44.061
Cops been rolling through
the hood looking for you, hop.

15:44.072 --> 15:45.996
Tell her I was framed.

15:46.472 --> 15:48.971
This  girl can lead me to the truth.

15:49.531 --> 15:51.081
El dice que le culparon

15:51.092 --> 15:53.737
y esta muchacha
puede llevarlo a la verdad.

15:54.632 --> 15:57.813
Entonces, no es el alma de ella
lo que está buscando.

15:59.765 --> 16:02.195
- Cause...
- Yeah, I know, I got it.

16:03.523 --> 16:05.550
She still needs
to be found.

16:37.377 --> 16:39.337
Ahora tienen que irse.

16:41.135 --> 16:42.590
Gracias.

16:54.170 --> 16:56.698
We need to see if this girl's mother
still lives around here.

16:56.732 --> 16:58.029
You know what ?

16:58.034 --> 17:00.083
Here on out, you need
to do this on your own, Hop.

17:00.098 --> 17:02.172
If this is all connected
to el Llorón,

17:02.312 --> 17:04.513
I ain't tryin'to be involved
on that level.

17:04.595 --> 17:06.756
You already are, Damien.

17:12.045 --> 17:13.488
Rita, is everything okay ?

17:13.505 --> 17:14.795
<i>Brett, where are you ?</i>

17:14.810 --> 17:16.425
- What's wrong ?
- These two detectives

17:16.429 --> 17:18.542
came and pulled me off my job.
They grilled me.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.693
- Wait, Chad didn't come get you ?
<i>- Chad ?</i>

17:20.695 --> 17:22.791
I haven't talked to Chad in weeks.

17:23.056 --> 17:24.748
<i>Brett, they're saying
you killed a man.</i>

17:24.752 --> 17:26.630
I know, I know,
and I didn't do it.

17:26.643 --> 17:29.466
I'll explain all that later.
Listen, for now, stay in the house,

17:29.483 --> 17:30.850
no matter what.

17:30.854 --> 17:33.284
All right, I'm gonna call you
right back.

17:39.657 --> 17:42.090
<i>You've reached Chad Shelton.
Leave a message.</i>

17:43.255 --> 17:44.937
Yeah, man, where are you ?

17:45.325 --> 17:47.171
No, we agreed this would be done
a certain way,

17:47.177 --> 17:48.947
and now you're changing
the plans on me. No...

17:48.960 --> 17:50.280
no, I'm not angry.

17:50.294 --> 17:53.051
I just feel like I keep telling you
the same thing over and over.

17:53.812 --> 17:55.130
Bye, mom.

17:58.042 --> 17:59.563
What are you doing here ?

18:10.350 --> 18:11.340
+

18:20.734 --> 18:23.472
- This is my family.
- Two minutes.

18:35.435 --> 18:37.223
Got it. Here it is.

18:38.129 --> 18:40.743
Thank you, sister.
All right, let's go.

18:47.383 --> 18:48.705
- Excuse me.
- I told you,

18:48.716 --> 18:50.546
he'll see you when he's ready.

18:53.406 --> 18:54.726
Okay, you know what ?

18:55.116 --> 18:56.749
Tell him he can find me
in Narcotics.

18:58.051 --> 18:59.378
Yeah, it's me.

19:00.351 --> 19:02.170
Reschedule,  Battle.

19:02.929 --> 19:04.219
He lost the book.

19:04.225 --> 19:06.128
How's your next week looking ?

19:17.806 --> 19:19.103
Don't stress, Hop.

19:19.110 --> 19:20.784
This side of town,
you blend right in.

19:20.796 --> 19:23.153
Yeah, right, with this
Bull's-eye on my chest.

19:23.168 --> 19:24.888
Bull's-eye ?
That's more like an "S."

19:24.904 --> 19:26.670
Today you're "supercop."

19:28.066 --> 19:30.393
I still can't figure how you found
that picture so fast.

19:30.409 --> 19:32.666
Been looking for it for a while.

19:35.836 --> 19:37.539
I hate this part.

19:37.819 --> 19:39.331
I know what you mean.

19:48.378 --> 19:49.230
Yes ?

19:49.243 --> 19:51.195
Ma'am, I'm detective Hopper.

19:51.785 --> 19:54.457
Are you related
to Isabella Contreras ?

19:56.964 --> 19:58.504
Yes, I'm her mother.

20:00.743 --> 20:02.387
May we come in, please ?

20:08.156 --> 20:09.140
Thank you.

20:22.971 --> 20:24.790
Yes, ma'am,
we've finally figured out

20:24.794 --> 20:26.639
what has happened to Isabella.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.500
I hate to say this to you, but...

20:33.225 --> 20:35.982
your daughter Isabella
has been killed, Mrs. Contreras.

20:40.475 --> 20:41.766
Con permiso, I...

20:41.780 --> 20:43.854
I've forgotten where the tea is.

20:52.464 --> 20:53.963
Mrs. Contreras...

21:08.209 --> 21:09.156
See ?

21:09.831 --> 21:11.917
She was just here yesterday.

21:11.959 --> 21:12.674
Who ?

21:13.119 --> 21:14.268
Isabella ?

21:15.366 --> 21:18.534
Yes. She told me before
she went to work that...

21:18.969 --> 21:20.502
she would be back tomorrow.

21:20.609 --> 21:21.650
Tomorrow ?

21:22.547 --> 21:24.671
Oh, I'm sorry, the tea.

21:29.279 --> 21:30.512
Damn, Hop.

21:30.633 --> 21:32.797
She thinks her daughter
is still alive.

21:33.308 --> 21:35.041
You need to go through her things ?

21:35.841 --> 21:38.799
I'm just saying, you need to show
some more respect for the dead.

21:38.987 --> 21:40.968
I'm trying to find
her killer, Damien.

21:41.145 --> 21:42.761
What do you call that ?

22:08.725 --> 22:11.224
Hotel soaps and shampoos.

22:11.266 --> 22:13.237
Maybe she worked at a hotel,

22:13.494 --> 22:15.818
cleaned rooms,
kept a few nice things.

22:15.831 --> 22:18.655
You ever heard of a hotel maid
that could afford dinner at Morton's...

22:25.261 --> 22:26.338
or these ?

22:28.730 --> 22:30.886
She had a papi chulo.

22:32.192 --> 22:34.473
What, that means "sugar daddy"?

22:34.497 --> 22:36.697
I'm right with you.

22:37.957 --> 22:41.099
Mrs. Contreras, did Isabella work
at a hotel ?

22:41.114 --> 22:41.790
No,

22:42.524 --> 22:44.618
a very expensive club.

22:44.988 --> 22:47.275
She tells me all the time
how nice the people are...

22:47.549 --> 22:48.934
very wealthy.

22:48.949 --> 22:50.697
You know the name of the club ?

22:51.069 --> 22:52.932
She said it all the time.

22:54.854 --> 22:56.940
Just come back tomorrow
when she's home.

22:56.955 --> 22:59.377
Then you can ask Isabella the name.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.162
Ma'am, I can't come back tomorrow.

23:04.168 --> 23:07.077
Isabella will be sorry
she missed you.

23:08.819 --> 23:11.623
I wish I had Mr. Detweiler's number.

23:11.802 --> 23:13.484
He'd remember.

23:13.489 --> 23:15.478
-  Detweiler ?
- Yes.

23:15.619 --> 23:18.529
He got Isabella the job
at the club.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.355
You really should
come back tomorrow.

23:28.451 --> 23:30.661
Now we've gotta find
this guy Detweiler.

23:31.202 --> 23:33.279
I was cool helping you
with sister Magdalena,

23:33.322 --> 23:34.976
but after that crazy-ass old lady,

23:34.990 --> 23:38.707
you can do this little "tenspeed and
brown shoe" routine by yourself.

23:40.496 --> 23:42.034
In case you forgot,

23:42.049 --> 23:44.761
- I got my own drama.
- Yeah.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.766
Sure, I'll be there.

24:03.553 --> 24:05.417
He's good.

24:12.796 --> 24:15.065
How the hell did they find us ?

24:16.560 --> 24:17.370
+

24:38.016 --> 24:40.544
Punk-ass bitches
blew up my ride.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.104
We gotta bounce.

24:59.865 --> 25:01.413
I don't give a damn
about that truck.

25:01.427 --> 25:03.754
Listen, anybody come near
my family : mama, Rosa,

25:03.769 --> 25:06.554
anybody...
you burn them to hell.

25:09.379 --> 25:11.130
Take me back to my truck ?

25:12.437 --> 25:14.474
I got a better idea.

25:19.859 --> 25:22.128
Hey, I just saved your ass.

25:22.239 --> 25:24.756
- Tú eres una maldición.
- What ?

25:24.761 --> 25:26.174
You're bad luck.

25:26.181 --> 25:29.100
- Whatever. Just take me to my truck.
- Your legs ain't broke.

25:29.106 --> 25:30.394
Use'em.

25:31.388 --> 25:33.388
Yo, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait !

25:36.087 --> 25:37.675
Forgot my damn...

25:38.417 --> 25:39.725
phone.

25:55.249 --> 25:57.171
Yeah... Andrea, it's me.

26:02.021 --> 26:03.961
Hopper, I heard something
on the way over here.

26:03.976 --> 26:06.206
I know, I gotta tell you about that.

26:07.197 --> 26:09.169
You know about Chad ?

26:10.535 --> 26:13.151
He was gunned down at an A.T.M.
On Olympic and Hope.

26:13.153 --> 26:15.939
- What ?
- They think it was an armed robbery.

26:20.433 --> 26:21.704
Okay...

26:23.118 --> 26:25.694
Damien was attacked,
and Chad was...

26:28.798 --> 26:31.680
- This has never happened before.
- What are you talking about ?

26:32.423 --> 26:34.556
You gotta take me to Rita's.

26:40.987 --> 26:41.996
Rita.

26:44.015 --> 26:46.054
I can't stop crying.

26:47.026 --> 26:48.961
How'd you find out ?

26:49.780 --> 26:51.848
They called me at the police station.
He still had me

26:51.860 --> 26:53.668
as a contact.

26:54.065 --> 26:56.739
Well, he was your husband.

26:57.461 --> 26:59.901
I know Chad and I had our problems,

26:59.919 --> 27:02.060
but he was a decent man.

27:02.850 --> 27:04.659
He was good in his own way.

27:04.674 --> 27:06.692
He just... he didn't have to die
like that,

27:06.706 --> 27:08.699
so senseless.

27:09.842 --> 27:11.844
After they told me, all I could keep
thinking about

27:11.857 --> 27:13.673
was you being safe.

27:18.523 --> 27:21.013
- They said...
- I know, I know. It's--it's not true.

27:22.790 --> 27:25.105
Then you shouldn't even be here
if they're looking for you.

27:25.122 --> 27:27.467
No, I wanted to make sure
you were all right.

27:29.294 --> 27:30.776
You should go.

27:31.391 --> 27:34.092
If anything was to ever
happen to you, Brett...

27:38.471 --> 27:39.455
Baby....

27:40.073 --> 27:42.137
I'm not going anywhere.

27:42.500 --> 27:43.827
- Stop it.
- I don't believe you.

27:43.843 --> 27:45.879
Seriously, I gotta go.

27:46.709 --> 27:49.170
So you're saying no
to breakfast ?

27:49.797 --> 27:51.442
When do you eat ?
I never see you eat.

27:51.447 --> 27:53.045
I eat. It's just...

27:53.056 --> 27:54.720
I know, cop stuff,

27:54.728 --> 27:56.496
- cop stuff, cop stuff.
- Come on.

27:57.411 --> 27:59.036
So what do you have to do today ?

27:59.053 --> 28:01.548
Today I gotta find a guy
named Detweiler.

28:01.566 --> 28:02.864
All right ?

28:03.291 --> 28:04.569
- Later.
- Move.

28:40.759 --> 28:43.567
You're going to admit
to killing Alberto Garza.

28:43.837 --> 28:46.799
Why ? Tell me why
this is happening !

28:46.813 --> 28:48.648
I swear to God,

28:48.798 --> 28:50.518
I will find you.

28:51.472 --> 28:52.761
Can I help you ?

28:53.220 --> 28:54.030
+

28:55.285 --> 28:56.980
Son of a bitch !

28:58.742 --> 29:01.046
Why are you doing this ?

29:01.060 --> 29:03.579
That's funny,
when I asked you why,

29:03.593 --> 29:05.641
you shoved
a needle in my neck.

29:05.820 --> 29:06.915
Conrad...

29:07.834 --> 29:09.793
- Conrad !
- Margaret, call 9-1-1.

29:09.808 --> 29:12.190
Yeah, Margaret,
why don't you do that ?

29:12.924 --> 29:14.444
What do you want ?

29:15.754 --> 29:17.848
You're gonna tell me everything,

29:17.863 --> 29:20.677
and then you're gonna give me
one reason why I shouldn't kill you.

29:23.044 --> 29:24.801
Well, there's one.

29:25.795 --> 29:27.630
I'm gonna count to three.

29:28.049 --> 29:28.944
One...

29:29.918 --> 29:30.911
two...

29:37.082 --> 29:39.495
Mr. Detweiler,
I'm detective Brett Hopper.

29:39.847 --> 29:41.364
How can I help you ?

29:41.599 --> 29:43.523
Just so we're clear,
I know who you are

29:43.536 --> 29:45.353
and what you're capable of.

29:46.301 --> 29:48.060
I'm sorry. I don't follow.

29:50.442 --> 29:52.578
I also know that your wife Margaret
is in the house

29:52.591 --> 29:55.348
with a shotgun.
Don't call for help.

29:57.578 --> 29:59.742
- Sure you don't want some ?
- I wanna know about Garza

29:59.755 --> 30:01.399
and the Contreras girl.

30:02.019 --> 30:04.717
I wanna know why the hell
you're doing this to me.

30:05.154 --> 30:06.273
Conrad.

30:07.707 --> 30:09.617
You didn't say
you had company.

30:09.843 --> 30:10.952
Margaret...

30:10.965 --> 30:13.293
dear,
this is detective Hopper.

30:14.553 --> 30:16.005
Hello, detective.

30:20.366 --> 30:23.027
Remember, Timmy's birthday party
is today at 4 :00.

30:23.300 --> 30:24.984
Address is on your desk.

30:25.937 --> 30:27.342
Pleasure to meet you.

30:41.021 --> 30:43.253
Does your family know
what kind of a man you are,

30:44.234 --> 30:46.780
that you torture and kill people
for a living ?

30:46.862 --> 30:48.151
My family

30:48.168 --> 30:49.446
is none of your business.

30:49.452 --> 30:51.489
You made my family
your business.

30:51.504 --> 30:53.407
I'm just playing along.

31:00.953 --> 31:02.031
Timmy...

31:02.553 --> 31:03.940
he's a good-looking kid.

31:03.954 --> 31:06.038
Looks just like his mother, Lila.

31:06.858 --> 31:08.445
I bet you can't wait
to go see them,

31:08.950 --> 31:11.181
along with your other
daughter, Catherine.

31:11.732 --> 31:14.029
Yeah, they have a really nice
place in Westwood.

31:17.005 --> 31:18.582
and when did you discover this ?

31:18.609 --> 31:19.792
Today.

31:19.910 --> 31:22.506
Well, sorry if I seem unimpressed,

31:22.982 --> 31:25.719
but you need to understand
that I've been doing this sort of thing

31:25.732 --> 31:27.981
since you were a little boy
with a toy badge,

31:27.997 --> 31:30.101
chasing after your father's shadow.

31:30.318 --> 31:32.690
What the hell do you know
about my father ?

31:35.668 --> 31:36.892
You're not that kind of man.

31:36.904 --> 31:38.811
You don't know
what kind of a man I am.

31:38.823 --> 31:41.023
Trust me when I say that I do,

31:41.191 --> 31:44.047
and you are nothing like
the people that I work for.

31:45.335 --> 31:46.567
What people ?

31:47.945 --> 31:49.175
Who do you work for ?

31:49.182 --> 31:51.720
People who'd do far worse
than threaten my family.

31:51.724 --> 31:54.268
People who would do far worse
than put a gun to my head,

31:54.284 --> 31:55.937
because that's never been
done before.

31:55.952 --> 31:57.530
You're gonna take me to them.

31:57.545 --> 32:00.185
- No, I'm not.
- Then you're gonna die.

32:02.791 --> 32:03.638
Hopper...

32:04.630 --> 32:07.217
what you don't realize
is that I am prepared

32:07.231 --> 32:08.733
to do whatever it takes

32:08.737 --> 32:11.195
in order to protect my family.

32:11.960 --> 32:12.568
So...

32:14.097 --> 32:15.357
go ahead.

32:16.486 --> 32:17.698
Pull the trigger.

32:27.880 --> 32:29.150
Can I help you ?

32:30.066 --> 32:31.585
Everything you want is inside :

32:31.600 --> 32:33.474
the murder book, the hourglass,
the photo,

32:33.478 --> 32:34.577
all of it. Just...

32:34.659 --> 32:36.947
- make it stop.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

32:36.952 --> 32:39.614
You don't have to come after me,
my sister or Rita.

32:39.628 --> 32:41.385
All right ? It ends today,
you understand ?

32:41.390 --> 32:43.055
You and the people
you work for,

32:43.068 --> 32:44.828
- you win.
- It's not that simple.

32:44.844 --> 32:45.557
No !

32:47.579 --> 32:49.041
Make it stop.

33:50.960 --> 33:52.624
He came to your house.

33:52.868 --> 33:55.174
I assume there must be
a leak at the station.

33:55.181 --> 33:58.187
Maybe you should have asked Hopper
how he found you before you let him go.

33:59.763 --> 34:01.965
Sorry, I felt letting him leave
was the best way

34:01.981 --> 34:04.028
to handle the situation,

34:04.099 --> 34:06.493
especially after he left this.

34:06.918 --> 34:08.478
He had everything :

34:08.588 --> 34:11.382
- the hourglass, the missing film...
- He had the murder book.

34:12.693 --> 34:14.280
How did he get it ?

34:16.356 --> 34:17.868
I don't know.

34:18.542 --> 34:20.715
What did he hope to accomplish ?

34:22.226 --> 34:24.501
All he said was :
"Make it stop."

34:24.911 --> 34:27.322
Beyond that, I have no idea
what he knows.

34:28.112 --> 34:30.027
<i>they're not going to be happy
you allowed Hopper</i>

34:30.040 --> 34:31.802
<i>to make contact with you.</i>

34:31.815 --> 34:33.835
<i>And how should I proceed ?</i>

34:34.194 --> 34:35.879
<i>If he took the murder book,</i>

34:35.891 --> 34:38.621
<i>he knows much more
than he's letting on.</i>

34:40.889 --> 34:42.456
Burn it all down.

34:43.987 --> 34:45.784
The cop who lost the book...

34:46.688 --> 34:48.748
He was gunned down
at an A.T.M.

34:49.099 --> 34:50.771
The gang leader...

34:53.940 --> 34:55.174
Hopper...

34:58.162 --> 34:59.717
kill them all.

35:00.222 --> 35:01.674
<i>And the girl ?</i>

35:04.194 --> 35:06.020
<i>I'll take care of the girl.</i>

35:06.900 --> 35:07.710
+

35:25.017 --> 35:27.698
Damien, shut up and listen. The skinheads
are still out there looking for you,

35:27.714 --> 35:29.781
all right ?
They're in a black van

35:29.796 --> 35:31.382
with a woman painted on the back.

35:31.396 --> 35:33.090
They're trying to kill you.

35:39.674 --> 35:41.163
Andrea, listen to me.

35:41.238 --> 35:43.495
- I need you to do something.
- Jen, are you all right ?

35:43.508 --> 35:45.357
- Yeah, Brett, what's wrong ?
- Where are you ?

35:45.362 --> 35:47.150
On my way to the mall.
Is everything all right ?

35:47.165 --> 35:49.047
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.616
- I'm fine.
- Where's Randall and the kids ?

35:51.634 --> 35:52.683
<i>At the house.</i>

35:52.695 --> 35:54.380
Jen, I need you to get home
immediately.

35:54.393 --> 35:56.883
Tell Randall if he sees anything
shady, to call the cops.

35:56.896 --> 35:59.099
- Brett...
- Jen, please, just do it.

36:29.351 --> 36:31.648
- Yeah.
<i>- We got the girl.</i>

36:33.503 --> 36:34.680
Good.

36:35.882 --> 36:37.365
I'm on my way.

36:43.065 --> 36:44.912
Nah, he's around here somewhere.

36:45.127 --> 36:47.579
They don't stray too far
from where they live.

36:47.716 --> 36:50.178
Tell Fencik once we take care
of this garbage,

36:50.193 --> 36:51.809
we'll call.

36:58.575 --> 36:59.585
Hey...

37:00.434 --> 37:02.243
heard you were looking
for me.

37:07.714 --> 37:09.558
No, we agreed this would
be done a certain way,

37:09.572 --> 37:11.459
and now you're changing
the plans on me. No...

37:11.462 --> 37:12.620
no, I'm not angry.

37:12.632 --> 37:15.505
I just feel like I keep telling you
the same thing over and over.

37:16.084 --> 37:17.490
Bye, mom.

37:20.457 --> 37:22.333
What are you doing here ?

37:25.437 --> 37:26.996
Tell you the truth,

37:27.775 --> 37:29.517
I'm not so sure.

37:45.269 --> 37:47.020
I thought something happened to you.

37:47.377 --> 37:49.859
I'm okay... those detectives,
they said...

37:49.873 --> 37:52.065
I know what they told you.
I didn't do it.

37:52.863 --> 37:54.981
Why... why is this happening ?

38:04.046 --> 38:06.238
A lot of people
could have been hurt today

38:06.971 --> 38:08.723
because of something I did...

38:09.649 --> 38:11.195
something I took.

38:12.680 --> 38:14.304
I... I don't understand.

38:17.443 --> 38:20.203
The most important thing
is that you're okay.

38:57.034 --> 38:58.670
Where's the girl ?

39:00.840 --> 39:02.411
You said you had her.

39:07.016 --> 39:09.037
This is not a night for mistakes.

39:09.167 --> 39:10.743
I agree, sir.

39:12.188 --> 39:14.159
So what's the problem ?

39:25.671 --> 39:27.602
You let him come to your house.

39:34.196 --> 39:35.440
Finish it.

39:35.452 --> 39:36.974
You just remember,

39:36.980 --> 39:39.514
next time it could be you.

39:57.836 --> 40:00.162
People are always
wondering what the difference is

40:00.179 --> 40:03.224
between a warning
and an example.

40:04.388 --> 40:06.761
The difference is rather simple.

40:07.896 --> 40:10.098
Most people don't heed warnings,

40:10.112 --> 40:13.188
but they learn from examples.

40:16.117 --> 40:17.714
This is an example...

40:19.176 --> 40:21.492
how we bury our secrets.

40:26.119 --> 40:28.129
I understand.
