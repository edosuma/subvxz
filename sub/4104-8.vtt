WEBVTT

00:03.354 --> 00:05.231
<i>I was born in space.</i>

00:05.398 --> 00:07.275
<i>I've never felt the sun on my face</i>

00:07.442 --> 00:10.403
<i>or breathed real air
or floated in the water.</i>

00:11.070 --> 00:12.238
<i>None of us have.</i>

00:12.405 --> 00:13.948
<i>For three generations,</i>

00:14.115 --> 00:16.993
<i>the Ark has kept what's left
of the human race alive.</i>

00:17.160 --> 00:19.120
<i>But now our home is dying,</i>

00:19.287 --> 00:22.248
<i>and we are the last hope of mankind.</i>

00:22.415 --> 00:25.627
<i>One hundred prisoners sent on
a desperate mission to the ground.</i>

00:25.793 --> 00:28.046
<i>Each of us is here
because we broke the law.</i>

00:28.212 --> 00:30.298
<i>On the ground, there is no law.</i>

00:30.465 --> 00:33.885
<i>All we have to do is survive.
But we will be tested</i>

00:34.052 --> 00:37.305
<i>by the earth,
by the secrets it hides,</i>

00:37.472 --> 00:39.515
<i>and, most of all, by each other.</i>

00:40.266 --> 00:41.684
<i>Previously on</i> The 100...

00:41.851 --> 00:43.728
- Who shot me?
- Bellamy Blake.

00:43.895 --> 00:45.188
He stowed away on the dropship.

00:45.355 --> 00:46.955
We're still investigating
who helped him.

00:47.690 --> 00:48.775
Kill the chancellor.

00:48.941 --> 00:50.301
<i>That's why you
took the wristbands,</i>

00:50.401 --> 00:51.879
you needed everyone
to think we're dead.

00:51.903 --> 00:53.237
The Ark finds out we're alive,

00:53.404 --> 00:56.074
they'll come down,
and when they do, I'm dead.

00:56.240 --> 00:58.910
Earth is survivable.

00:59.077 --> 01:01.329
Mankind is going home.

01:01.496 --> 01:03.706
Hey, why were you defending him?

01:03.873 --> 01:05.248
Because he saved my life.

01:10.463 --> 01:12.298
I never wanted any
of this to happen to you.

01:13.091 --> 01:14.550
Thank you.

01:40.159 --> 01:42.537
Did you talk to the Ark?

01:43.413 --> 01:46.541
I told Digg's mom the news,
John's dad.

01:46.708 --> 01:48.185
I'm supposed to talk
to Roma's parents later.

01:48.209 --> 01:51.629
Thanks for doing that.
I owe you.

01:52.505 --> 01:55.466
Telling all these parents that their
kids were murdered by Grounders...

01:56.467 --> 01:57.820
...I just wish I could say
we were getting some justice.

01:57.844 --> 01:59.554
We're not killing him.

02:07.311 --> 02:10.857
You were a lot scarier
when you had that face paint on.

02:17.488 --> 02:18.656
<i>Tell me about the Grounder.</i>

02:18.823 --> 02:21.159
<i>Can he provide any insight
on how to survive winter?</i>

02:23.286 --> 02:25.121
<i>We're doing everything
we can to prepare here.</i>

02:25.288 --> 02:28.499
<i>We're gathering nuts and berries,
curing meats, digging for roots,</i>

02:28.666 --> 02:31.335
but the truth is,
we'll freeze before we starve.

02:31.502 --> 02:33.004
<i>There's good news on that front.</i>

02:33.171 --> 02:35.673
<i>According to civil defense plans
from before the war,</i>

02:35.840 --> 02:39.635
there's an old emergency aid depot
not far from the landing site.

02:39.802 --> 02:42.305
- Here are the coordinates.
- In addition to supplies,

02:42.472 --> 02:44.072
it could provide shelter for the hundred

02:44.098 --> 02:45.933
and for the citizens
coming down from the Ark.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.894
<i>And what makes you think it's intact?</i>

02:48.060 --> 02:49.788
It was designed
to withstand nuclear warfare.

02:49.812 --> 02:51.063
<i>All right. It's worth a shot.</i>

02:51.355 --> 02:53.816
Chancellor, I have to object.

02:53.983 --> 02:55.401
Project Exodus is underway.

02:55.568 --> 02:57.195
The kids should sit tight
in their camp

02:57.361 --> 02:58.988
until the first dropship launches.

02:59.113 --> 03:00.782
Even if everything goes
without a hitch,

03:00.990 --> 03:02.617
the hundred would die from exposure

03:02.784 --> 03:04.494
before relief arrives.

03:05.495 --> 03:08.289
I'd like a moment
with Clarke alone, please.

03:08.915 --> 03:12.210
And I know there's a line of parents
waiting to talk to their kids.

03:18.466 --> 03:21.427
Clarke, we all are very proud

03:21.594 --> 03:24.055
<i>of what you've done down there.
Your mother...</i>

03:24.222 --> 03:26.182
I don't want to talk about my mother.

03:27.558 --> 03:29.936
<i>Please, Clarke. It's time to forgive.</i>

03:30.102 --> 03:32.313
<i>Let me schedule a time
for you and Abby to sit down...</i>

03:32.480 --> 03:37.568
Look, I know you both think
that betraying my dad,

03:37.735 --> 03:41.364
killing him,
was an unavoidable tragedy.

03:42.782 --> 03:45.284
But I don't see it that way,
and I never will.

03:46.786 --> 03:49.497
So just tell me who's next
and let someone

03:49.664 --> 03:52.083
who actually wants to talk
to their parents have a turn.

03:57.755 --> 03:58.756
Dax.

04:01.092 --> 04:02.885
Hey, you guys seen Dax?

04:03.594 --> 04:05.012
Over there on the meat crew.

04:07.598 --> 04:10.351
Dax... you're up.

04:21.070 --> 04:22.238
Where's my mom?

04:22.405 --> 04:24.574
<i>You can see her after you
and I have a little talk.</i>

04:24.740 --> 04:27.785
- Are you alone?
- Yeah. Why?

04:27.952 --> 04:30.538
<i>If I remember right,
you beat a man to death.</i>

04:30.705 --> 04:33.249
- He stole from me.
- Relax.

04:33.416 --> 04:36.460
<i>I have a problem,
and I think you can help me fix it.</i>

04:36.627 --> 04:38.254
<i>And in return,
I can guarantee your mom</i>

04:38.421 --> 04:40.548
<i>a spot on the first dropship...</i>

04:40.965 --> 04:44.510
<i>...and for you a choice assignment
when I get to the ground.</i>

04:46.470 --> 04:48.347
What do you want me to do?

04:50.099 --> 04:52.143
<i>Kill Bellamy Blake.</i>

05:04.447 --> 05:05.781
You're still here?

05:05.948 --> 05:08.117
I'm not moving until you
let me up there to see him.

05:09.035 --> 05:10.661
Get comfortable.

05:13.039 --> 05:14.707
I let him live. Isn't that enough?

05:14.874 --> 05:18.044
He saved my life and yours.

05:18.210 --> 05:20.570
- I know you see it that way, but...
- That's the way it is.

05:21.005 --> 05:23.758
- He's still dangerous.
- Only because of what you did.

05:23.925 --> 05:25.485
Whatever twisted connection
you think you have

05:25.509 --> 05:27.386
with that animal, forget it.

05:27.553 --> 05:30.014
You don't get to see him.
End of conversation.

05:30.348 --> 05:32.808
Why do you even care
if I ruined your life?

05:32.975 --> 05:34.477
You should want me to go up there.

05:34.644 --> 05:37.146
Maybe you'll get lucky
and he'll kill me, problem solved.

05:37.313 --> 05:39.857
Octavia, you know I didn't mean that.

05:40.983 --> 05:43.611
- Bellamy.
- The answer is still no.

05:43.778 --> 05:46.739
- I'm not talking to Jaha.
- Hey, relax.

05:46.906 --> 05:48.532
- That's not why I'm here.
- What, then?

05:48.699 --> 05:50.859
The Ark found some old records
that show a supply depot

05:50.952 --> 05:53.955
- not too far from here.
- What kind of supplies?

05:54.121 --> 05:56.499
The kind that might give us
a chance to live through winter.

05:57.249 --> 05:59.049
I'm gonna go check it out.
I could use backup.

05:59.210 --> 06:01.045
Why are you asking me?

06:01.212 --> 06:02.880
Well, because right now, I don't feel

06:03.047 --> 06:05.257
like being around anyone
I actually like.

06:10.304 --> 06:12.723
I'll get my stuff, meet you in ten.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.561
What do you think they're
gonna do with the grounder?

06:23.275 --> 06:24.986
I'd rather not think about it.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.405
Well, it's been days
since Bellamy captured him.

06:27.571 --> 06:29.198
How long till his friends
come looking?

06:30.491 --> 06:34.412
Cheer up. In that time,
we'll all be dead from hypothermia.

06:37.415 --> 06:39.000
Hey!

06:40.501 --> 06:42.044
How are you feeling?

06:43.087 --> 06:45.548
Weak, bored.

06:47.216 --> 06:48.509
Grateful to be alive.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.053
Well, if you want to stay that way,
you should rest.

06:51.220 --> 06:52.805
I'll tie him down if I have to.

06:57.852 --> 07:00.604
I'm gonna be out of camp today.

07:00.771 --> 07:02.416
Can you change his bandages
in a few hours?

07:02.440 --> 07:04.066
Wait. Where are you going?

07:04.316 --> 07:05.796
It's a little assignment
from the Ark.

07:05.943 --> 07:08.183
- It's nothing to worry about.
- It's not safe out there.

07:08.279 --> 07:11.115
Finn, Clarke's a big girl.
She can take care of herself.

07:11.907 --> 07:12.908
Clarke...

07:14.410 --> 07:16.037
Let's get a move on.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.289
Make sure he stays in bed.

07:19.498 --> 07:20.791
It sounds like a plan.

07:28.758 --> 07:30.301
That's a lot of rations.

07:30.968 --> 07:32.845
You realize this is a day trip.

07:33.012 --> 07:35.139
A lot can happen in a day.

08:12.802 --> 08:15.596
Hey, Miller, Roma's parents
are waiting for you on the radio.

08:35.533 --> 08:37.784
Hi. We don't have a lot of time.

08:42.664 --> 08:44.375
I brought you some water.

08:46.752 --> 08:48.212
Here.

08:53.134 --> 08:54.885
It's good, right?

08:57.680 --> 09:00.224
Sorry I haven't seen you
since everything happened.

09:02.726 --> 09:04.937
My brother's been keeping me away.

09:06.063 --> 09:08.649
He's a total dick, which you
probably already figured out.

09:10.442 --> 09:13.487
You do understand me.
I knew it.

09:18.284 --> 09:20.578
Well, at least let me get you
cleaned up quick.

09:48.397 --> 09:50.858
This is all my fault because
I freaked out so bad

09:51.025 --> 09:52.860
when you locked me up in that cave.

09:56.488 --> 09:59.742
You'd totally understand why
if you knew how I grew up.

10:01.827 --> 10:05.414
My name is Lincoln.

10:09.418 --> 10:10.961
Lincoln.

10:12.463 --> 10:13.881
I'm Octavia.

10:20.679 --> 10:22.473
Well, is that it?

10:22.640 --> 10:24.475
Is that all you're gonna say?

10:25.809 --> 10:27.728
It's not safe for us to talk.

10:29.230 --> 10:33.150
Well, if we shouldn't talk,
then why did you tell me your name?

10:34.652 --> 10:39.156
I want you to remember me...
after I'm dead.

10:39.573 --> 10:42.409
You're not gonna die.
Don't say that.

10:42.576 --> 10:44.036
Octavia...

10:45.371 --> 10:49.166
...this... this only ends one way.

10:49.833 --> 10:51.293
Just talk to them.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.338
Tell them you're not the enemy.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.092
I am.

11:03.681 --> 11:05.557
Octavia, get the hell out now.

11:05.724 --> 11:06.850
Bellamy is not even here.

11:07.017 --> 11:09.246
Get out, or he gets the beating
I've been aching to give him.

11:09.270 --> 11:12.189
Okay, Okay, I get it. I'm gone.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.455
You know, the first dropship
is gonna come down soon.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.875
Pretty sure you
can't avoid Jaha forever.

11:32.042 --> 11:33.335
I can try.

11:39.591 --> 11:42.720
The depot is supposed
to be around here... somewhere.

11:42.886 --> 11:46.056
- There's got to be a door.
- Maybe he'll be lenient.

11:46.223 --> 11:47.367
Look, I shot the man, Clarke.

11:47.391 --> 11:49.435
He's not just gonna
forgive and forget.

11:51.020 --> 11:52.540
Let's just split up,
cover more ground.

11:52.604 --> 11:54.106
Stay within shouting distance.

12:10.581 --> 12:11.832
I'd hate to see the other guy.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.877
You did, when you were torturing him.

12:15.794 --> 12:17.087
Finn was dying.

12:17.254 --> 12:19.965
I'm not gonna apologize
for doing what I had to do.

12:20.132 --> 12:22.926
It must suck to come
all the way down here

12:23.093 --> 12:25.346
to find out your boyfriend
is into somebody else.

12:29.308 --> 12:31.435
I'm not doing this with you.

12:51.830 --> 12:54.792
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:57.961 --> 12:59.671
Thirsty?

13:09.306 --> 13:10.682
Let me get that.

13:24.488 --> 13:26.573
Wait. Wait.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.860
I've been waiting since they
locked you up on the Ark.

13:30.369 --> 13:33.664
We can't, not till we talk.

13:33.831 --> 13:35.124
I don't want to talk.

13:39.044 --> 13:41.004
- Something happened.
- Finn...

13:41.171 --> 13:43.090
I know, and I don't want
to talk about it.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.259
- Well...
- Ever.

13:48.262 --> 13:49.847
Do you love me?

13:51.807 --> 13:53.267
Always.

13:53.434 --> 13:54.601
Okay, then.

14:04.820 --> 14:06.572
You're supposed to be resting.

14:07.406 --> 14:09.074
Let me.

14:35.642 --> 14:36.977
Bellamy.

14:39.897 --> 14:42.399
Over here. I found a door.

14:49.406 --> 14:50.866
I think it's rusted shut.

14:51.033 --> 14:52.576
Here. Watch your foot.

14:54.870 --> 14:56.538
- Okay. Give me a hand.
- Okay.

15:06.632 --> 15:07.966
Here.

15:09.218 --> 15:11.845
You really think this place hasn't
been touched since the war?

15:13.096 --> 15:14.848
A girl can dream.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.100
Come on.

15:27.653 --> 15:29.446
Hell of a place to die.

15:33.492 --> 15:37.120
So much for living down here.
This place is disgusting.

15:38.330 --> 15:39.790
Damn it.

15:40.999 --> 15:43.043
Anything left
down here is ruined.

15:45.963 --> 15:48.298
They must have distributed
most of the supplies

15:48.465 --> 15:50.300
before the last bombs went off.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.229
Hey, I found blankets.

16:02.396 --> 16:04.314
Excited about a couple of blankets?

16:05.816 --> 16:07.818
Well, it's something.

16:07.985 --> 16:11.989
How about a canteen or a med kit
or a decent fricking tent?

16:40.684 --> 16:43.228
- Oh, my God.
- What?

16:50.360 --> 16:51.945
Earth is scary.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.655
It's amazing.

16:53.822 --> 16:55.866
Fresh air, trees...

16:57.868 --> 16:59.620
...nuts.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.165
These taste better than usual, right?

17:05.083 --> 17:07.044
I'd like to give Earth a giant hug.

17:08.170 --> 17:09.713
You're acting weird.

17:09.880 --> 17:12.840
I feel weird, but in a good way.

17:14.718 --> 17:15.886
I gotta pee.

17:53.799 --> 17:55.550
Octavia? Octavia!

17:57.427 --> 18:00.472
I think I'm going crazy,
or the Grounders are here,

18:00.639 --> 18:02.933
- or I'm going crazy, or...
- Okay. Just slow down.

18:03.100 --> 18:05.018
Just tell me what you saw.

18:09.690 --> 18:11.316
Him.

18:13.777 --> 18:16.279
- Jasper, there's no one there.
- He's right there!

18:16.446 --> 18:18.846
We have to run. We have to run.
Why isn't anyone doing any...

18:18.907 --> 18:21.326
Stop it. Shut up.
Jasper, are you on something?

18:21.493 --> 18:23.453
I love you, and I just
want you to know this.

18:23.620 --> 18:25.455
We're all gonna die soon, okay?

18:25.622 --> 18:26.998
I love you.

18:28.125 --> 18:29.418
Is this all you've eaten today?

18:29.584 --> 18:31.253
It is, but who the hell cares now?

18:33.505 --> 18:34.923
You're totally bombed.

18:36.466 --> 18:39.636
Relax. Here, buddy. Take this.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.140
- It's a stick.
- No.

18:43.306 --> 18:45.100
This is an anti-Grounder stick.

18:45.267 --> 18:48.645
So as long as you hold
this and you sit right here,

18:48.812 --> 18:50.480
Grounders won't be able to see you.

18:51.648 --> 18:53.442
- See?
- Yeah. Makes sense.

18:53.608 --> 18:55.444
I'll just stay right here.

18:56.361 --> 18:57.988
Does make sense.

18:58.822 --> 19:00.323
Stay right there.

19:06.329 --> 19:08.707
- Get out.
- Relax.

19:09.458 --> 19:10.959
Thought you might be hungry.

19:11.668 --> 19:13.420
A peace offering.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.756
I shouldn't have come
up here alone earlier.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.133
It was stupid and dangerous, and...

19:19.426 --> 19:21.261
...he's not worth it.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.305
I won't tell Bellamy if you won't.

19:29.519 --> 19:30.896
<i>This changes everything.</i>

19:32.189 --> 19:33.982
No more running from spears.

19:35.233 --> 19:36.526
Ready to be a badass, Clarke?

19:36.693 --> 19:39.005
Look, I'm not gonna fight you
on bringing guns back to camp.

19:39.029 --> 19:42.199
I know we need them,
but don't expect me to like it.

19:42.365 --> 19:44.125
We're lucky the rifles
were packed in grease.

19:44.284 --> 19:47.871
The fact that they survived means
we're not sitting ducks anymore.

19:48.747 --> 19:50.248
You need to learn how to do this.

19:54.211 --> 19:56.296
So I just hold it on my shoulder?

19:56.963 --> 19:59.549
Yeah. A little higher.

20:03.345 --> 20:06.515
Yeah. That's good.
Uh, watch and learn.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.112
Still watching.

20:21.279 --> 20:22.531
My bullets are duds.

20:23.281 --> 20:24.324
Try yours.

20:34.835 --> 20:37.128
That was amazing.

20:39.339 --> 20:42.843
- Am I horrible for feeling that?
- Try again.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.511
No. We shouldn't
waste the ammunition.

20:44.678 --> 20:46.805
- You need to practice.
- No, we need to talk about

20:46.972 --> 20:48.723
how we're gonna
keep guns around camp,

20:48.890 --> 20:51.852
where are we gonna keep them,
and who has access.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.731
You left Miller in charge
of the grounder.

20:57.858 --> 21:00.944
- You must trust him.
- You should keep him close.

21:01.111 --> 21:04.573
- The others listen to him.
- I should keep him close?

21:04.739 --> 21:06.741
Bellamy, what's going on?

21:06.908 --> 21:09.202
You've been acting weird all day.

21:12.247 --> 21:14.124
All the rations you took.

21:14.541 --> 21:17.294
You're gonna run.
That's why you agreed to come with me.

21:17.460 --> 21:19.796
You were gonna load up on
supplies and just disappear.

21:19.921 --> 21:22.132
I don't have a choice.
The Ark will be here soon.

21:22.299 --> 21:23.967
So you're just gonna leave Octavia?

21:24.134 --> 21:25.454
Octavia hates me. She'll be fine.

21:25.510 --> 21:28.221
- You don't know...
- I shot the chancellor.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.639
They're gonna kill me, Clarke.

21:29.806 --> 21:31.600
Best-case scenario, they lock me up

21:31.766 --> 21:33.160
with the Grounder
for the rest of my life,

21:33.184 --> 21:37.397
and there's no way in hell
I'm giving Jaha the satisfaction.

21:37.647 --> 21:39.399
Keep practicing. I need some air.

22:03.173 --> 22:04.841
Bellamy Blake.

22:23.193 --> 22:25.695
How are you here? You're on the Ark.

22:25.862 --> 22:28.615
You shot me on the Ark,

22:28.782 --> 22:30.492
but I've been waiting for you.

22:35.705 --> 22:37.916
- I did what I had to do.
- To protect Octavia.

22:38.083 --> 22:40.669
- That's right.
- Pathetic.

22:40.835 --> 22:43.296
Using your sister
to justify your crimes,

22:43.463 --> 22:46.174
your cruelty, your selfishness?

22:46.341 --> 22:48.176
If you're gonna kill me, just do it.

22:49.928 --> 22:51.721
Why should I kill you?

22:52.847 --> 22:56.309
Unlike the others,
I survived your treachery.

22:57.894 --> 22:59.396
What are you talking about?

23:00.438 --> 23:04.275
The 320 souls that were culled
from the Ark

23:04.442 --> 23:07.195
so that others could live.

23:07.612 --> 23:10.156
You knew that they
would be sacrificed.

23:12.450 --> 23:13.910
The radio.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.414
I didn't know that would happen.

23:17.580 --> 23:20.208
It's not my forgiveness
you should seek.

23:20.375 --> 23:22.210
It's theirs.

23:22.377 --> 23:23.878
Murderer.

23:24.045 --> 23:25.797
<i>Murderer.</i>

23:25.964 --> 23:27.924
<i>Murderer.</i>

23:28.091 --> 23:29.426
<i>Murderer.</i>

23:29.592 --> 23:31.761
Murderer.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.514
- Murderer.
- Stop!

24:18.391 --> 24:20.393
It's not what you imagined, is it?

24:23.521 --> 24:24.606
Dad?

25:01.810 --> 25:03.853
- Hey, is the moon in here?
- Monty.

25:04.020 --> 25:06.773
I can't change the tide
if the moon won't cooperate.

25:06.940 --> 25:08.191
Get out of here.

25:08.358 --> 25:09.984
It's basic physics.

25:13.321 --> 25:14.864
Stay here.

25:28.211 --> 25:30.213
Scratch that. Get out here.

25:41.307 --> 25:42.934
You're not real, are you?

25:43.101 --> 25:47.188
Sorry, kiddo. I wish I were.

25:48.148 --> 25:51.484
Wait. How is this possible?

25:51.651 --> 25:56.406
I'm thinking why,
more important than how.

25:56.573 --> 25:58.116
Why me?

26:00.952 --> 26:02.745
Because I miss you.

26:04.205 --> 26:06.708
Think there's more
to it than that, kiddo.

26:18.094 --> 26:20.305
You want me to forgive her.

26:32.609 --> 26:34.569
Your mom loves you, Clarke.

26:36.029 --> 26:39.490
She betrayed you.
How can I forgive her for that?

26:43.286 --> 26:45.955
The disappointed look isn't fair.

26:48.249 --> 26:50.001
I'm trying.

26:50.335 --> 26:53.087
I'm trying all the time.

26:53.755 --> 26:57.467
But everyone's counting on me,
and it's so hard.

26:57.634 --> 27:01.179
Come here. I know, honey.

27:03.431 --> 27:05.350
It's been tough, hasn't it?

27:06.142 --> 27:08.770
I let someone get tortured.

27:13.650 --> 27:14.984
Listen.

27:16.819 --> 27:18.905
You're doing the best you can.

27:19.072 --> 27:22.242
You want me to say Mom
did the best she could.

27:24.619 --> 27:26.412
This is about what you want.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.833
You're dead because of her.

27:31.709 --> 27:33.836
She doesn't deserve my forgiveness.

27:36.547 --> 27:38.174
Listen to me.

27:39.259 --> 27:43.012
Forgiveness isn't
about what people deserve.

27:48.977 --> 27:50.478
Look. I'm sorry.

27:51.479 --> 27:52.689
I can't.

27:52.939 --> 27:54.065
Whatever.

27:54.899 --> 27:56.067
Crazy bitch.

27:56.442 --> 27:57.568
Dad?

28:04.867 --> 28:05.952
Don't move.

28:07.036 --> 28:08.204
Ah!

28:08.371 --> 28:10.415
You need to go. Now.

28:14.877 --> 28:17.463
- Why are you doing this?
- Just get dressed.

28:18.131 --> 28:20.758
They'll know you helped me.

28:21.009 --> 28:23.928
You said it.
You stay here, you'll die.

28:24.095 --> 28:25.888
I'm not gonna let that happen.

28:28.057 --> 28:29.892
I'm not gonna put you in danger.

28:30.059 --> 28:31.394
You need to do this now.

28:32.228 --> 28:36.190
Okay. Even in these clothes,
I'll be seen.

28:36.774 --> 28:39.569
People are seeing plenty
of things right now.

28:40.862 --> 28:41.946
Up you get.

28:44.991 --> 28:46.284
Okay. Let's go.

28:49.203 --> 28:50.538
What'd you do?

28:50.872 --> 28:53.041
Set out some of our winter
rations a little early.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.211
Jobi nuts,
the food you gave my guard.

28:57.378 --> 29:00.214
They go bad, they cause visions,
but it wears off.

29:00.381 --> 29:02.342
Just try to get as far away
as you can, okay?

29:02.508 --> 29:04.802
And try not to get yourself killed.

29:37.919 --> 29:39.087
Tell me again.

29:39.462 --> 29:44.592
You are the most beautiful broom
in a broom closet of brooms.

29:44.759 --> 29:46.469
Mm!

29:53.226 --> 29:55.103
I got this one.

30:26.551 --> 30:28.302
Murderer.

30:28.469 --> 30:29.720
<i>Murderer.</i>

30:29.887 --> 30:32.390
<i>Murderer. Murderer.</i>

30:32.557 --> 30:33.850
<i>Murderer.</i>

30:34.016 --> 30:36.102
<i>Murderer. Murderer.</i>

30:40.356 --> 30:42.316
Please... kill me.

30:43.443 --> 30:45.319
Kill me!

30:52.535 --> 30:55.037
I deserve it. Please.

30:59.876 --> 31:02.211
I can't fight anymore.

31:03.463 --> 31:07.675
Don't you know?
Life is a fight.

31:13.306 --> 31:14.932
What am I supposed to do?

31:15.099 --> 31:18.936
Live, breathe, suffer.

31:19.103 --> 31:23.065
You owe them that.
You want the peace of death.

31:25.109 --> 31:26.527
Then you're gonna have to earn it.

31:28.154 --> 31:29.697
Ah!

31:29.947 --> 31:31.616
Fight back!

31:40.374 --> 31:44.045
Do you think you deserve
to be free of your pain?

31:44.212 --> 31:45.588
Do you deserve that gift?

31:46.839 --> 31:49.091
Because you're gonna get it.

31:54.472 --> 31:56.390
Nothing personal.

32:04.857 --> 32:06.984
Put it down, Dax.

32:08.277 --> 32:09.946
Should've stayed down there, Clarke.

32:10.821 --> 32:14.033
I tried not to kill you,
but here you are,

32:14.200 --> 32:16.786
and Shumway said no witnesses.

32:16.953 --> 32:18.579
What is he talking about?

32:19.080 --> 32:20.665
Shumway set it up.

32:21.457 --> 32:23.918
He gave me the gun
to shoot the chancellor.

32:24.085 --> 32:26.128
Walk away now, and I won't kill you.

32:26.295 --> 32:28.339
Put it down.

32:29.215 --> 32:30.758
Your choice.

32:34.971 --> 32:36.556
No!

32:56.117 --> 32:57.618
Get the hell off him!

33:25.354 --> 33:26.772
You're okay.

33:29.066 --> 33:30.693
No, I'm not.

33:32.194 --> 33:33.863
My mother...

33:35.865 --> 33:37.783
If she knew what I'd done.

33:38.659 --> 33:39.660
Who I am.

33:41.162 --> 33:43.998
She raised me to be better,
to be good.

33:44.165 --> 33:46.751
- Bellamy...
- And all I do is hurt people.

33:48.044 --> 33:50.254
I'm a monster.

33:50.421 --> 33:52.340
Hey...

33:53.799 --> 33:55.885
You have saved my life today.

33:57.720 --> 34:00.389
You may be a total ass
half the time...

34:02.266 --> 34:05.978
but... I need you.

34:08.022 --> 34:09.940
We all need you.

34:11.108 --> 34:13.944
None of us would've survived
this place if it wasn't for you.

34:16.030 --> 34:18.949
You want forgiveness,
fine, I'll give it to you.

34:19.116 --> 34:20.618
You're forgiven, okay?

34:21.369 --> 34:23.120
But you can't run, Bellamy.

34:24.996 --> 34:27.123
You have to come back with me.

34:28.333 --> 34:29.877
You have to face it.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.672
Like you faced your mom?

34:41.304 --> 34:44.516
You're right.
I don't want to face my mom.

34:46.393 --> 34:48.396
I don't want to face any of it.

34:51.315 --> 34:54.860
All I think about every day is how
we're gonna keep everyone alive.

34:56.112 --> 34:57.822
But we don't have a choice.

35:03.035 --> 35:05.538
Jaha will kill me when he comes down.

35:08.290 --> 35:10.167
We'll figure something out.

35:13.462 --> 35:15.297
Can we figure it out later?

35:25.141 --> 35:26.976
Whenever you're ready.

35:37.820 --> 35:39.238
Rough night?

35:39.655 --> 35:43.826
Yeah. My head is killing me.

35:43.993 --> 35:46.996
- You?
- I'm pretty sure I ate a pine cone.

35:47.747 --> 35:49.248
Because it told me to.

35:49.415 --> 35:51.917
He's gone! The Grounder's gone!

35:52.084 --> 35:54.003
You hear that?

35:55.629 --> 35:57.506
What if he brings
other Grounders back?

35:57.673 --> 35:59.216
- He'll kill us all.
- Or worse.

36:00.092 --> 36:01.510
Let the Grounders come.

36:05.306 --> 36:09.185
We've been afraid of them
for far too long, and why?

36:09.351 --> 36:11.312
Because of their knives and spears.

36:11.479 --> 36:13.439
I don't know about you...

36:13.939 --> 36:15.524
...but I'm tired of being afraid.

36:21.655 --> 36:22.823
No way.

36:22.990 --> 36:25.701
These are weapons, okay, not toys.

36:25.868 --> 36:28.579
And we have to be prepared
to give them up to the guard

36:28.746 --> 36:31.957
when the dropships come.
But until then,

36:32.124 --> 36:33.751
they're gonna help keep us safe.

36:33.918 --> 36:35.878
And there are plenty more
where these came from.

36:36.754 --> 36:38.839
Tomorrow we start training.

36:40.424 --> 36:44.553
And if the Grounders come,
we're gonna be ready to fight.

37:18.879 --> 37:21.090
I don't expect you to forgive me...

37:21.590 --> 37:23.843
...but you'll have to find
a way to live with me.

37:26.887 --> 37:28.889
Because I'm not going anywhere.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.395
Bellamy.

37:35.980 --> 37:37.147
It's time.

37:47.908 --> 37:51.996
That Grounder escaping...
was that you?

37:53.956 --> 37:56.208
I had nothing to do with it.

38:00.045 --> 38:01.630
Thanks for the blanket.

38:07.469 --> 38:08.971
<i>Mr. Blake.</i>

38:09.138 --> 38:11.849
<i>I've wanted to talk to you
for some time now.</i>

38:12.016 --> 38:15.269
Before you do...
I'd like to say something.

38:16.145 --> 38:20.399
When you sent us down here...
you sent us to die.

38:21.275 --> 38:26.363
But miraculously,
most of us are still alive.

38:26.530 --> 38:29.783
In large part,
that is because of him.

38:29.950 --> 38:31.827
Because of Bellamy.

38:34.955 --> 38:38.459
He's one of us, and he deserves
to be pardoned of his crimes,

38:38.626 --> 38:40.461
just like the rest of us.

38:40.628 --> 38:43.797
<i>Clarke, I appreciate your point
of view, but it's not that simple.</i>

38:43.964 --> 38:47.259
It is. If you want to know who
on the Ark wants you dead.

39:02.024 --> 39:06.445
<i>Bellamy Blake,
you're pardoned for your crimes.</i>

39:09.448 --> 39:14.244
<i>Now, tell me who gave you the gun.</i>

39:31.095 --> 39:32.554
You're a disgrace.

39:33.472 --> 39:37.309
I'm fighting for what I believe in...
just like you.

39:37.476 --> 39:39.353
And what, exactly, is that?

39:53.701 --> 39:55.369
I need to check this.

39:56.203 --> 39:58.872
Guns? Really?

40:00.624 --> 40:03.419
The Grounder escaping,
we have to expect retaliation.

40:04.878 --> 40:06.797
We have to be prepared.

40:06.964 --> 40:09.675
Yeah. Our ancestors
wanted to be prepared, too.

40:09.842 --> 40:13.846
- So they built bombs.
- Rifles are not the same as nukes.

40:14.013 --> 40:15.806
In Bellamy's hands, they are.

40:16.181 --> 40:17.599
Clarke, come on.

40:17.766 --> 40:19.244
You can't predict what he's gonna do.

40:19.268 --> 40:23.313
- There's no perfect answer, Finn.
- The Grounder saved Octavia's life,

40:23.480 --> 40:25.250
and Bellamy brought him
back here and tortured him.

40:25.274 --> 40:27.377
Yeah, but if he hadn't brought him
back here, you'd be dead.

40:27.401 --> 40:29.194
- I know.
- I trust him.

40:33.699 --> 40:35.576
You can't be serious.

40:37.202 --> 40:38.287
I am.

40:40.372 --> 40:41.582
Clarke...

40:43.208 --> 40:45.753
You and Bellamy are leading us
down a dangerous road.

40:46.045 --> 40:48.130
I wish you would've talked
to me about it first.

40:50.174 --> 40:52.593
I wish you'd talked to me
about a lot of things.

40:53.260 --> 40:54.636
But you didn't.

41:16.241 --> 41:17.868
Thank God it's you.

41:18.410 --> 41:20.329
I thought I was about to float.

41:24.333 --> 41:26.460
It won't come to that, Commander.

41:27.044 --> 41:29.671
Wait. What's going on?
I did what you asked me...
