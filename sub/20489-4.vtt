00:31.031 --> 00:32.998
I've been
waiting for over an hour.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.035
If i said yes to half the guys
who wanted to buy me a drink,

00:35.070 --> 00:37.037
you'd be pouring
me out of this meat rack.

00:37.072 --> 00:39.039
All in the line
of duty, shalimar.

00:39.074 --> 00:40.505
Yeah but why here?

00:40.540 --> 00:42.507
Well,
donna's still reluctant,

00:42.542 --> 00:44.509
i wanted to let her
choose the rendez-vous spot.

00:44.544 --> 00:47.047
This seems
more like brennan's kind
of assignment if you ask me.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.549
She seemed more comfortable
meeting you, maybe because

00:49.584 --> 00:53.018
you're both members
of the feral sisterhood.

00:53.053 --> 00:56.056
So i'm the lucky sister who
gets to ease her transition

00:56.091 --> 00:57.057
into the underground.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.559
Well, you knew the job was
dangerous when you took it.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.562
Well, i guess
i missed the babysitting
part of the job description.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.072
You said nine o'clock.

01:12.572 --> 01:13.823
I'm sorry i'm late.

01:13.858 --> 01:15.040
Bag in the car?

01:15.075 --> 01:16.826
I didn't pack my bag.

01:16.861 --> 01:18.543
I changed my mind.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.545
I don't
need to go into
the underground.

01:20.580 --> 01:24.584
Donna,
we're pretty sure the gsa
has you in their sights.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.051
Yeah.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.587
They're only looking
for new mutants, right?

01:28.088 --> 01:29.589
Which you clearly are.

01:29.624 --> 01:31.091
Listen, i've got to go.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.058
My date's waiting.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.061
Hey, you've
got a date, with me.

01:36.096 --> 01:40.100
Adam told me
entering the underground
was completely voluntary.

01:40.135 --> 01:41.566
So?

01:41.601 --> 01:44.104
So, you tell adam that i
said thanks for everything,

01:44.139 --> 01:45.605
but no thanks.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.579
Whoa, hey, sugar.

01:54.614 --> 01:59.619
Do you believe
in love at first sight
or should i walk by again?

01:59.654 --> 02:01.586
Yeah, only
this time, don't stop.

02:01.621 --> 02:06.626
I may appear drunk, but
i'm just intoxicated by you.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.144
Hey, see a tall
brunette pass by here?

02:24.179 --> 02:25.610
Yeah.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.647
She took off
in a black beemer.

02:27.682 --> 02:29.149
Thanks.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.121
So how big are
you talking, jack?

02:36.156 --> 02:40.660
Well, sixty-three
inches, wide screen.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.128
Uh-huh.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.665
Ten thousand dollar
surround sound system.

02:45.700 --> 02:49.169
It's better than a multiplex.

02:49.204 --> 02:50.670
Wow.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.173
Something tells
me i'm not the first
girl who's got to check

02:53.208 --> 02:55.175
out your home
entertainment unit.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.178
Maybe not but
you'd be the best.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.695
You okay, donna?

03:15.730 --> 03:17.697
I don't think so.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.205
If you're sick, i can
get you to the hospital.

03:25.240 --> 03:26.706
There's
one right over...

04:00.740 --> 04:03.243
what the hell was that?

05:10.243 --> 05:12.745
I warned her there's a good
chance the gsa has her targeted.

05:12.780 --> 05:16.214
And she refused to accept
the gravity of the situation?

05:16.249 --> 05:18.251
I mean, it was like
she felt like she didn't
need to worry about it.

05:18.286 --> 05:19.717
It's classical denial.

05:19.752 --> 05:21.754
It's a mind that
can't deal with the facts

05:21.789 --> 05:23.256
just willing
them out of existence.

05:23.291 --> 05:24.722
Adam?

05:24.757 --> 05:26.759
Adam, donna's name came
up in the genomex scan again.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.761
Right, see, they're
after her for something.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.229
I should've never
have let her leave.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.766
No, we can't force
somebody into the underground
against their will.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.233
I thought we had her convinced.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.270
So did i. You go see
her again and maybe in the

05:37.770 --> 05:40.773
cold light of
day, she'll see reason.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.275
I'll give it a shot.

06:00.793 --> 06:03.546
Ms bell.

06:03.581 --> 06:06.264
Mr. Eckhart.

06:06.299 --> 06:08.801
You work in auditing,
is that right?

06:08.836 --> 06:11.304
Yes, sir.

06:16.309 --> 06:19.312
Well, i have to say you're
quite the little go-getter.

06:19.812 --> 06:21.814
Well, if you look at
my employee progress report,

06:21.849 --> 06:24.317
you'll see very
high marks for initiative.

06:24.352 --> 06:26.284
Yes, i'm not surprised,

06:26.319 --> 06:30.788
seeing as how you
accessed my private e-mail.

06:30.823 --> 06:34.827
I felt that what i uncovered
warranted the risk of bypassing

06:34.862 --> 06:37.795
my immediate superiors.

06:37.830 --> 06:40.798
And what exactly
did you uncover?

06:40.833 --> 06:43.586
During an internal audit,
i stumbled across several

06:43.621 --> 06:46.304
anomalies: Inconsistent
equipment appropriations,

06:46.339 --> 06:51.844
un-logged mainframe time,
altered supply requisitions,

06:51.879 --> 06:54.812
all pointing
to one conclusion.

06:54.847 --> 06:57.350
Unauthorized research
in genomex labs.

06:57.385 --> 06:59.317
Indeed.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.354
That's a very serious charge.

07:01.854 --> 07:05.358
So you understand why i
had to bring it immediately
to your attention.

07:05.393 --> 07:07.360
Absolutely.

07:08.861 --> 07:12.865
And do we know who's involved
or what they're doing?

07:12.900 --> 07:15.385
I'm following
several leads, sir.

07:15.420 --> 07:17.896
Rest assured i
will find the culprit.

07:17.931 --> 07:20.373
Your diligence
will not go unnoticed.

07:20.408 --> 07:22.875
Thank you, sir.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.149
Nice shot.

07:47.184 --> 07:48.901
What's up?

07:49.402 --> 07:51.369
I thought i'd
work out with you guys.

07:51.404 --> 07:54.907
These are physical exercises,
emma, not mental ones.

07:55.408 --> 07:56.874
So?

07:56.909 --> 07:58.876
I can be just
as physical as you.

07:58.911 --> 08:01.414
Yeah, i mean when it comes to
bending spoons with your mind,

08:01.914 --> 08:02.415
you've got us beat.

08:02.915 --> 08:03.881
But...

08:03.916 --> 08:05.918
we just don't want
you to get hurt, that's all.

08:05.953 --> 08:06.919
Okay?

08:12.925 --> 08:14.427
Ow.

08:16.929 --> 08:18.431
What the
hell was that for?

08:23.436 --> 08:25.938
Let's try to
play nice, huh, boys?

08:32.945 --> 08:34.412
Donna's not here.

08:34.447 --> 08:35.948
I've been ringing
for a few minutes.

08:35.982 --> 08:36.948
There's no answer.

08:37.450 --> 08:38.951
Can you get into her apartment,
see what you can find out?

08:42.455 --> 08:43.456
Not a problem.

08:44.957 --> 08:47.460
I'll have
brennan and jesse try to find
the date from last night.

08:47.495 --> 08:48.961
Cool.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.939
Yeah, she's a regular.

09:01.974 --> 09:03.976
I've seen her in here with
any number of different guys.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.978
You remember seeing
her with anyone last night?

09:06.013 --> 09:07.480
Afraid not.

09:09.982 --> 09:11.984
Would you remember
me if you saw me last night?

09:12.485 --> 09:16.489
Did this conversation
suddenly take a turn?

09:16.989 --> 09:19.957
I hope so.

09:19.992 --> 09:22.960
So you didn't get
a look at the driver?

09:22.995 --> 09:25.998
Like i said, car pulls up,
she comes in for a few minutes,

09:26.033 --> 09:28.000
goes back out,
they take off.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.258
Hey, guys,
how's it going?

09:36.293 --> 09:38.010
What are
you doing here?

09:38.511 --> 09:39.977
Thought i'd see if
you needed any help.

09:40.012 --> 09:44.517
Thanks, emma, but i think
we're doing fine on our own.

09:44.552 --> 09:46.519
So what'd you find out?

09:48.521 --> 09:51.023
Bartender's
free tomorrow night.

09:57.029 --> 09:59.532
Just think about the
car, everything you saw.

09:59.567 --> 10:01.033
Look,
i already told these guys.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.035
I know.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.537
Just think.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.014
Qrf 592.

10:17.049 --> 10:18.551
The license plate, right?

10:19.051 --> 10:20.052
Yeah.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.054
Does that help?

10:22.089 --> 10:23.556
Yeah, big time.

12:27.179 --> 12:30.683
I'm not used to losing,
but i could get used to it.

12:31.183 --> 12:32.685
What are you doing
in donna's apartment?

12:32.720 --> 12:35.187
I could ask
you the same thing.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.654
What's going on in there?

12:36.689 --> 12:39.191
Open up or i'll call the police.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.695
So, got a name?

12:42.730 --> 12:44.161
Shalimar.

12:44.196 --> 12:46.198
You're a friend of donna's?

12:46.233 --> 12:48.217
More or less.

12:48.252 --> 12:50.167
Now who are you?

12:50.202 --> 12:54.206
Donna and i have
a standing appointment.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.173
Really?

12:56.208 --> 12:57.710
Are you a married man?

12:58.210 --> 13:00.212
Ah, no,
nothing like that.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.214
I've been treating her.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.681
To what?

13:03.716 --> 13:05.217
Oh, you're good.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.219
Obviously.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.688
I was supposed to meet
her here this morning.

13:10.723 --> 13:13.726
And if she doesn't show up,
you just let yourself in?

13:13.761 --> 13:17.730
No,
that's why she gave me this.

13:17.765 --> 13:20.232
Any idea where she is?

13:20.267 --> 13:22.199
I don't know.

13:22.234 --> 13:24.201
Looks like she split.

13:24.236 --> 13:29.241
I knew she
was leaving town but not
before her final treatment.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.208
Yeah.

13:31.243 --> 13:34.211
What are these treatments?

13:34.246 --> 13:36.248
I told you i'd call the police.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.267
They're on their way.

13:38.302 --> 13:40.278
My car's out front.

13:40.313 --> 13:42.254
My bike's out back.

13:52.531 --> 13:55.034
Eyebrows weren't
quite that heavy.

13:58.037 --> 14:01.040
And he had these cute dimples,

14:03.042 --> 14:05.044
right here.

14:10.049 --> 14:11.800
Like that?

14:11.835 --> 14:13.945
That's him.

14:13.980 --> 14:16.020
Now what?

14:16.055 --> 14:18.557
Now we'll cross-reference his
face with all the pertinent

14:18.592 --> 14:21.060
databanks and
see what we can find.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.569
This guy really
got to you, didn't he?

14:31.070 --> 14:34.073
It was like bam, the second
we laid eyes on each other.

14:34.108 --> 14:37.594
An instant
feral attraction.

14:37.629 --> 14:41.080
No, it was more than that.

14:45.584 --> 14:48.087
I mean, you hear about
love at first sight.

14:48.587 --> 14:51.089
It's basically a sudden
shift in brain chemistry.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.592
In your case, accelerated
by your shared mutancy.

14:53.627 --> 14:57.096
Believe me, adam,
my brain had nothing to do

14:57.596 --> 14:59.598
with what went on back there.

14:59.633 --> 15:01.065
Of course it did.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.567
You found yourself in
a highly charged situation.

15:03.602 --> 15:06.605
The dopamine and phenylethamine
released in your brain

15:06.640 --> 15:08.572
created a euphoria.

15:08.607 --> 15:12.611
Simultaneously,
the norepinephrine
triggered an adrenaline

15:12.646 --> 15:17.133
release which stimulated
flushed cheeks, heavy breathing,

15:17.168 --> 15:21.146
sweaty palms and this sudden
shift probably triggered a

15:21.181 --> 15:25.124
limbic system takeover, allowing
reduced integration with

15:25.159 --> 15:29.128
your cortex, resulting
in feelings of infatuation.

15:29.163 --> 15:31.147
Whatever.

15:31.182 --> 15:33.132
I was hot.

15:43.142 --> 15:46.145
What are you
doing with my computer?

15:46.645 --> 15:49.648
It's a genomex computer.

15:49.683 --> 15:52.116
We just work here.

15:52.151 --> 15:54.618
Doesn't explain
what you're doing.

15:54.653 --> 15:57.656
Work authorization says
you've got a frozen hard drive.

15:58.157 --> 16:02.661
There's nothing wrong
with my hard drive.

16:02.696 --> 16:04.628
So i see.

16:04.663 --> 16:07.166
Must've been a
screw-up on our side.

16:07.201 --> 16:10.169
Sorry for
the inconvenience.

16:19.178 --> 16:22.681
Richard saunders, ph. d.

16:27.686 --> 16:30.654
Research
associate at genomex?

16:30.689 --> 16:33.192
If he's been treating donna,
that would explain why her name

16:33.227 --> 16:35.694
kept popping
up in our scans.

16:36.195 --> 16:38.197
Adam, the guy
works for genomex.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.664
Well, that doesn't necessarily
mean what you think.

16:40.699 --> 16:43.702
Come on, i mean, we're
talking about the cover
corporation for the gsa.

16:43.737 --> 16:45.704
Yeah, but except for the top
echelon, genomex employees are

16:45.739 --> 16:48.207
kept in the dark
about gsa activities.

16:48.707 --> 16:51.210
So he may have no idea who these
bastards are he's working for.

16:51.245 --> 16:53.212
Research associate?

16:53.247 --> 16:55.179
Probably not.

16:55.214 --> 16:56.715
Well,
i've got to let him know.

16:57.216 --> 16:58.717
Jesse can turn out
genomex id for me, right?

16:58.752 --> 17:00.184
Yeah, well, of course.

17:00.219 --> 17:02.471
Wait... i can't let you
go waltzing into genomex alone.

17:02.506 --> 17:04.723
Well, you want to know about
these treatments, too, right?

17:04.758 --> 17:05.723
Well, yeah,
but it's dangerous.

17:06.224 --> 17:07.976
Well,
i'm a big girl, adam.

17:08.011 --> 17:09.619
Besides, what can i say?

17:09.655 --> 17:11.230
I'm a fool for love.

17:18.237 --> 17:19.738
Mr. Eckhart,

17:25.743 --> 17:27.711
i believe i've tracked
down the source of the

17:27.746 --> 17:31.250
unauthorized
research, but i still don't
have irrefutable evidence.

17:31.285 --> 17:34.753
You're new to the inner workings
of our organization, karen.

17:34.788 --> 17:37.756
Gsa's criteria for determining
guilt is rather less

17:38.257 --> 17:41.760
stringent than
you'll find out there.

17:41.795 --> 17:45.729
When can i
expect some results?

17:45.764 --> 17:47.766
Well, now that
i've narrowed the field,

17:47.801 --> 17:48.767
i'm monitoring
computer activity.

17:49.268 --> 17:51.235
When the suspect
opens incriminating files,

17:51.270 --> 17:53.737
i'll gain full access
and establish culpability.

17:53.772 --> 17:59.778
At that point, i'll inform you
and you can initiate seizure.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.793
Or you can
initiate seizure.

18:15.294 --> 18:17.761
Me, sir?

18:17.796 --> 18:20.299
I assume your ambitions lie
beyond the auditing department.

18:20.334 --> 18:21.800
Well, yes.

18:22.301 --> 18:24.803
I'll arrange for a couple
of gs agents for you.

18:30.309 --> 18:33.812
Good luck.

18:33.847 --> 18:35.814
Yeah.

18:40.319 --> 18:42.286
Jack mitchell.

18:42.321 --> 18:44.072
Car's registered
to his business,

18:44.107 --> 18:45.824
hartwell brokerage,
sixth and mason.

18:46.325 --> 18:47.291
Great.

18:47.326 --> 18:48.827
I know that part of town.

18:48.862 --> 18:50.294
We'll go talk to the guy.

18:50.329 --> 18:52.331
Find out what happened
to donna last night.

18:52.366 --> 18:54.350
Brennan and
i are on it, adam.

18:54.385 --> 18:56.335
Give me an update
within the hour.

19:00.839 --> 19:02.341
Got him.

19:15.354 --> 19:18.857
Not very gentlemanly
to leave a girl high and dry.

19:18.892 --> 19:20.359
Shalimar.

19:20.859 --> 19:22.826
What are
you doing here?

19:22.861 --> 19:26.865
Well, for one, i want to
know about these treatments

19:26.900 --> 19:28.867
you've been giving donna.

19:29.368 --> 19:30.869
And for another?

19:40.379 --> 19:43.847
The treatments?

19:43.882 --> 19:47.351
Donna wants
a normal life.

19:47.386 --> 19:49.388
I've been helping
her to find it.

19:49.888 --> 19:53.391
I've developed
a serum to help reverse
genetic mutation.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.895
The treatment
takes a few weeks and
once the genetic codes

19:56.930 --> 20:01.400
are realigned,
all traces of mutancy
will disappear.

20:01.435 --> 20:03.402
Wow.

20:06.905 --> 20:07.906
Damn it.

20:08.407 --> 20:09.408
They got in.

20:14.413 --> 20:16.415
Here,
let's go.

20:26.925 --> 20:29.428
Find them.
