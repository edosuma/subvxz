WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:01.502
.

00:01.535 --> 00:02.303
- I just found this
on the squad table!

00:03.404 --> 00:05.139
- His name is Mr. Sprinkles.

00:05.173 --> 00:07.408
We think he would be a very
good firefighter mascot.

00:08.542 --> 00:11.112
- You need anything, day or
night, 24/7, you call me.

00:11.145 --> 00:14.382
- Girl tries to steal drugs,
maybe you're getting snowed.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.350
- She's gone!
She's not at the hospital,

00:16.384 --> 00:18.086
she's not at the
apartment.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.253
I know how you feel about
the way I'm handling this.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.155
- It doesn't matter how I feel.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.224
You're gonna do whatever
you're gonna do anyway.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.526
- You know, there's that
stretch of Milwaukee Avenue

00:25.559 --> 00:27.195
where I see teens
in those encampments.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.663
- No, I don't think so.

00:51.585 --> 00:57.658
*

01:01.462 --> 01:04.732
*

01:04.765 --> 01:07.701
- Hey.

01:07.735 --> 01:11.172
- Hey, sorry. Go back to bed.

01:12.873 --> 01:15.709
- A while ago.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.713
- Bria, yeah.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.783
I'm on her Facebook page.
She hasn't posted in days.

01:22.816 --> 01:26.120
*

01:26.154 --> 01:27.455
- You gotta get
some sleep, babe.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.323
- I will, I will, it's just--

01:29.357 --> 01:30.858
Tina said she didn't
have any relatives

01:30.891 --> 01:34.428
who could care for her, but
this woman, Melinda Tripp,

01:34.462 --> 01:36.330
she replied to some
post about a year ago

01:36.364 --> 01:40.268
and Bria replied back
calling her "Aunt Melinda."

01:40.301 --> 01:42.470
I think that's kind of weird.

01:42.503 --> 01:47.308
*

01:47.341 --> 01:50.211
Would you be cool if Kidd
subbed for me tomorrow?

01:50.244 --> 01:51.745
I mean, if it's gonna
put you in a bind,

01:51.779 --> 01:55.383
I'll suck it up, but I really
want to keep working this.

01:55.416 --> 01:59.287
- Well, I'm the captain, so
I can make that work, I guess.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.289
Yeah.
- Great, thanks.

02:01.322 --> 02:08.462
*

02:12.300 --> 02:14.502
- Uh-oh, looks like
you're doing less fires

02:14.535 --> 02:16.270
and more taking
temperatures today, huh?

02:16.304 --> 02:18.372
- Yeah, Casey
called bright and early

02:18.406 --> 02:20.508
to ask if I
could sub for Dawson.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.776
- Apparently, she's
beating herself up

02:22.810 --> 02:24.378
about this missing girl.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.747
- Yeah, she has a tendency
to do that.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.482
- Yeah.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.756
- That's never a good way
to start a conversation.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.858
- Oh, something is ripe!

02:37.891 --> 02:39.193
- I don't smell anything.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.628
- Well, you're blind,

02:40.661 --> 02:42.363
or whatever the smell
equivalent of that is.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.831
- Curiously enough,

02:43.864 --> 02:47.235
the female nostril holds 1,000
times the smell receptors

02:47.268 --> 02:48.302
as their male counterparts.

02:48.336 --> 02:49.803
- That sounds made up.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.439
- It was on the internet.

02:51.472 --> 02:54.608
- Maybe it's the gym bag that
Capp keeps under his bed.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.344
I don't think he's aired
that thing out in years.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.746
- Mm-mm. Saw him
leave with it yesterday.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.981
- That's his overnight bag.
I'm talking about the bag

03:01.014 --> 03:02.916
under his bed he
calls his "go bag."

03:04.718 --> 03:07.788
- Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61,

03:07.821 --> 03:11.392
woman caught in machine.
805 South Quincy Street.

03:16.997 --> 03:24.405
*

03:32.913 --> 03:34.548
- Yo, watch your backs.

03:34.582 --> 03:37.618
Coming through! Fire
Department! Step back, please!

03:37.651 --> 03:39.487
Step back! Step back!
- Excuse us! Excuse us!

03:39.520 --> 03:41.255
- Thank you!
- Back, back, come on!

03:41.289 --> 03:42.590
- I'm late! Let's go!
- Help me!

03:42.623 --> 03:45.593
- Come on!
- Please, help me!

03:47.961 --> 03:49.397
- Hold on, ma'am!

03:49.430 --> 03:52.400
- Ow, it hurts!
Please, someone help me!

03:57.338 --> 03:59.607
[women exclaim,
crowd commotion]

03:59.640 --> 04:02.876
Please, help me!

04:02.910 --> 04:05.679
Please! Get me out of here!

04:05.713 --> 04:09.617
- Ow! Help me, please!
Get me out of here!

04:09.650 --> 04:12.586
- Knock the rest of this glass
off, cut through here.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.655
Ma'am, you gotta stop moving!
- It hurts!

04:14.688 --> 04:16.023
- We're working to get you out,

04:16.056 --> 04:17.558
you're making it
worse for yourself!

04:17.591 --> 04:18.926
- It's killing me!
Hey, can you

04:18.959 --> 04:20.628
use your little glass
breaker on my section?

04:20.661 --> 04:22.029
- Hey, stop touching the glass,

04:22.062 --> 04:23.764
shut up, and stand back!
Hey, cover

04:23.797 --> 04:26.033
your head with your jacket!

04:26.066 --> 04:27.368
- I need you to
cover your eyes.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.969
We're gonna
break the glass.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.639
- Herrmann, grab the cutters.
- Right, on it.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.607
*

04:38.111 --> 04:39.747
- All right, Stella,
get the morphine.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.551
- I need you to
hold still, okay?

04:43.584 --> 04:44.885
- Okay.
- We've got you.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.787
I'm gonna get you some
medication for the pain.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.556
- Oh, please hurry up!

04:48.589 --> 04:49.923
- Come on, let's go!

04:49.957 --> 04:52.793
- All right, guys.
- Hey, I got a meeting!

04:52.826 --> 04:53.961
Come on!

04:55.496 --> 04:57.398
Help me!
- Hey, do that again,

04:57.431 --> 04:59.700
and we'll leave you
in there all day!

04:59.733 --> 05:02.936
*

05:24.057 --> 05:25.793
- Okay, Brett, Kidd!

05:25.826 --> 05:27.595
*

05:27.628 --> 05:29.997
- Okay.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.965
- Ow!

05:35.135 --> 05:37.104
- All right, guys.

05:37.137 --> 05:40.040
- Oh, please.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.744
- Got the leg.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.145
Watch her head.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.981
- Ow! Ow!
- All right.

05:48.015 --> 05:52.920
*

05:52.953 --> 05:55.122
- Give us a few minutes to
get this glass swept up.

05:55.155 --> 05:58.091
- Hey! Hey!

05:58.125 --> 06:00.428
Let me out!

06:08.001 --> 06:11.905
What the--

06:11.939 --> 06:14.775
What the--come on!

06:18.111 --> 06:19.613
- Hey.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.650
- Yeah, what do
you need, buddy?

06:22.683 --> 06:24.184
- You were the guy
with the woman last night

06:24.217 --> 06:25.853
under the 18th Street bridge?

06:25.886 --> 06:28.889
You were showing that
picture of the girl around?

06:28.922 --> 06:29.890
- Yeah.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.959
Uh, that was me.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.727
- Yeah, I know her.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.798
- Well, I--I went
to school with her.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.467
Payton Grizzlies.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.504
- Yeah, um, she hangs
out with these kids

06:43.537 --> 06:46.940
behind this small market
on 16th and Kenilworth.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.810
Well, at least, she used to.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.513
- Why the hell didn't you
tell me that last night?

06:52.546 --> 06:53.881
Come on, man.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.449
You looked like cops.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.886
Can you help me out a bit?

07:07.194 --> 07:11.665
*

07:11.699 --> 07:12.966
- Hey.

07:15.869 --> 07:19.139
You and Gabby were walking
around Skid Row last night?

07:19.172 --> 07:21.074
- Yeah, I thought she told you.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.810
- Well, she told me you
were out looking for Bria.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.144
I didn't know to what extent.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.946
- Well, it was my suggestion.

07:25.979 --> 07:29.850
We didn't find her, so...
I guess it was a bad idea.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.952
*

07:31.985 --> 07:34.488
- Okay. Thanks.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.524
- Dawson probably just
doesn't want you worried.

07:36.557 --> 07:39.226
She knows how you feel
about...

07:41.261 --> 07:43.531
- Getting too close to victims.

07:47.100 --> 07:53.206
*

07:53.240 --> 07:54.808
Oh!
- Ooh...

07:54.842 --> 07:57.110
- Yeah. Definitely
smell it now!

07:57.144 --> 08:01.048
- Yeah, what's fair is foul,
and what's foul is fair.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.852
- It's stinky!

08:04.885 --> 08:08.856
- Hey, Capp, did you
empty your go

08:08.889 --> 08:10.991
- My guess is that
it's the paramedics.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.160
I mean, who knows what
they keep in their bunks.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.532
- Maybe.
- That deserves no reply.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.835
First shift is trying
to pull a joke on us.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.571
There's all kinds of novelty
gags you can buy.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.673
Poo powder, barf mix.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.240
Hey, Captain!

08:27.274 --> 08:30.277
Who on first shift is most
likely to want to punk us, huh?

08:30.310 --> 08:33.013
Smolik

08:33.046 --> 08:35.749
- The smell--we think it might
be first shift messing with us.

08:35.783 --> 08:38.619
- I don't have time for this.
- Sorry, Cap.

08:38.652 --> 08:39.953
- Everyone go through
your personal belongings

08:39.987 --> 08:42.022
until the source of
the smell is located.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.957
Someone left something rotten
in a bag

08:43.991 --> 08:46.927
or shelf or footlocker,
so find it.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.606
- Hey.

08:58.639 --> 09:01.909
- Hey, I found a Melinda Tripp
listed in Joliet.

09:01.942 --> 09:04.144
I think from her Facebook
she might be Bria's aunt.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.813
I'm on my way there now,

09:05.846 --> 09:07.180
I figured it was worth the
gas money to check it out.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.749
- Great, I got a lead too.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.918
Some kid who went to
Bria's school said that

09:10.951 --> 09:12.753
her group used to hang
out behind some market.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.321
I don't know if the kid's
shining me on,

09:14.354 --> 09:16.657
but I'll look into it
and see what I can find out.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.626
- Okay, keep me posted.
- Will do.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.728
Dawson.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.899
Have you talked to Casey?

09:28.135 --> 09:29.703
- He's worried about you.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.605
*

09:31.639 --> 09:34.675
- Um, okay,
I'll call him later.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.610
Catch him up.
- Okay.

09:36.644 --> 09:43.851
*

09:50.290 --> 09:50.658
.

09:50.691 --> 09:50.858
- Hey!

09:52.192 --> 09:55.295
Did you talk to Dawson?
- Nope.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.631
- Okay, well, she's in
Joliet, checking up on--

09:58.932 --> 10:02.936
- Yeah, something about
an aunt on Facebook?

10:04.437 --> 10:06.740
- I'm not trying to get
in the middle of anything.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.041
I just want to find this girl.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.010
- I'm here to help!

10:11.979 --> 10:14.181
- I'm gonna roll squad
by that, uh...

10:14.214 --> 10:17.017
by that market on Kenilworth,
see if I can learn anything.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.052
Radios are on if we catch a
call, double time it there?

10:19.086 --> 10:20.387
Cool?
- Yeah, do it.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.756
- Okay.

10:22.790 --> 10:25.092
Squad 3,
let's go for a ride!

10:37.370 --> 10:40.808
I'll be back in a minute.

10:40.841 --> 10:41.809
- No, I got this.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.344
- Hey, get me a Laffy Taffy.

10:53.053 --> 11:00.260
*

11:01.261 --> 11:02.963
- Hey, uh, need
to talk to you.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.267
Hey! Just a--just a sec!

11:07.300 --> 11:08.969
Wait!

11:15.108 --> 11:17.344
It's about a girl named Bria!

11:17.377 --> 11:24.417
*

11:47.841 --> 11:49.943
- Give it back.

11:49.977 --> 11:52.079
It's mine.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.885
- Tell me what you
know about Bria.

11:57.918 --> 12:01.021
- Come on, man.
- Trying to help her.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.291
- She was gonna
go see her dad.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.893
They have him locked
up at one of these

12:05.926 --> 12:08.161
mandatory rehab
facilities or something.

12:08.195 --> 12:11.031
I told her don't do it,
but she's stubborn.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.066
- That I know.
- She said she'd come back

12:13.100 --> 12:14.902
after she saw him,
but she didn't.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.970
Cops maybe got her.

12:17.004 --> 12:18.338
I don't know.
This whole thing sucks.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.474
She shouldn't have to
be dealing with this.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.854
If you find her, tell her
we're all worried about her.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.522
- I will.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.234
I think it's gotten stronger.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.468
- Yeah.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.070
I think you're right.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.939
- Ugh, I'm starting
to get a migraine.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.440
- Well, we can't
sleep in here tonight.

12:53.473 --> 12:56.543
- Could be black mold.
It's a total teardown, if so.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.378
I saw it on "Fixer Upper,"
it's a health hazard.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.247
You gotta rip apart the
entire building, start over.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.481
- Okay.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.050
Let's get these bunks
out of here.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.251
We'll move them
into the hallway

13:04.284 --> 13:05.552
or put them in
the briefing room.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.320
- Good idea, then
if the hallways smells,

13:07.354 --> 13:08.922
we'll know it's the mattresses,
if it doesn't,

13:08.956 --> 13:10.257
it's definitely
something in here.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.525
- Black mold! Tellin' ya!

13:18.565 --> 13:21.301
- Oh, uh...hang on.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.070
I gotta--
- Let it go.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.873
Let it go.
- You had it from the bottom.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.008
Don't grab it from the top.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.080
- Chief.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.581
- Can I borrow the desk
Hope was using?

13:34.614 --> 13:36.984
I gotta finish these call logs,
and the bunkroom is--

13:37.017 --> 13:38.485
- Be my guest.

13:40.020 --> 13:44.024
You know, I've been thinking,
um, since you made captain,

13:44.057 --> 13:45.959
you should maybe take
the blue office.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.394
Move out of the bunkroom.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.529
I've been using it for storage
since Patterson was here.

13:49.562 --> 13:52.632
We could easily clean it out,
set you up in there.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.035
I noticed the extra 100 feet
the men have to go to

13:55.068 --> 13:56.269
to complain
about their problems.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.872
Might as well be a mile.

13:58.906 --> 14:03.610
They'll work out some of this
nonsense themselves, you know.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.578
- Sounds interesting, Chief.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.951
- Ambulance 61,
3831 S. Lawndale,

14:10.984 --> 14:12.619
woman down from
unknown causes.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.189
- So the way I do it
is I find the vein,

14:16.223 --> 14:18.025
occlude it with your thumb--
- Mm-hmm.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.327
- And push the blood upward
and out with your other finger.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.428
- Mm-hmm.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.196
- And where the blood
back-flows to,

14:23.230 --> 14:24.397
that's the valve, that's
how you avoid hitting it.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.099
- That's smart!

14:26.133 --> 14:27.567
Dawson's always
telling me to eyeball it!

14:27.600 --> 14:30.103
- Oh, and that avoids sticking
your patient a million times!

14:30.137 --> 14:31.504
- That's what
I've been saying.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.174
- Hey, your
technique is dead-on.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.343
It is all kinds of awesome,

14:36.376 --> 14:38.078
riding with you.
I mean, don't get me wrong,

14:38.111 --> 14:42.649
I love me some Gabby, but
we click, like ruby slippers!

14:48.688 --> 14:54.127
*

14:54.161 --> 14:55.963
- Oh, hey, I got one!

14:55.996 --> 14:58.966
Make the stretcher with a
little extra length

14:58.999 --> 15:00.267
at the foot end.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.202
- So if you get
an extra tall victim,

15:02.235 --> 15:03.436
you have room
to cover their feet

15:03.470 --> 15:05.205
so when you
unload the stretcher

15:05.238 --> 15:06.473
and you accidentally
bump into him,

15:06.506 --> 15:08.441
you don't get gunk all
over your shirt.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.577
- That's a good one.
- Mm-hmm!

15:15.148 --> 15:17.484
- It's my mom!
- Show us where.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.453
- She's in the basement,
and she won't get up!

15:20.487 --> 15:22.956
I tried going down there,
but I couldn't breathe,

15:22.990 --> 15:25.092
and Mom told me
if there's ever an accident

15:25.125 --> 15:28.161
to call 911.
- You did great.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.233
Will you stay over there
until we come and get you?

15:33.266 --> 15:35.235
- Okay.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.505
- Exhaust pipe from
the dryer disconnects

15:38.538 --> 15:40.273
could flood the whole
basement with carbon monoxide.

15:40.307 --> 15:43.143
- We gotta get Mom out.
- Okay. Hold our breath.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.444
I'll get her arms,
you get her legs.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.613
We're in and out, 20 seconds.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.081
- Okay.

15:49.549 --> 15:56.589
*

16:01.694 --> 16:04.131
- Chloramine.

16:07.100 --> 16:12.672
*

16:19.212 --> 16:20.547
Okay.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.382
Her pulse is weak.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.551
- Mom, Mom, no!

16:24.584 --> 16:26.219
- Gemma.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.021
- Gemma,
can you do us a favor?

16:28.055 --> 16:29.356
Will you grab us some
towels and a robe?

16:29.389 --> 16:30.590
We're gonna take
care of your mom.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.025
- Okay.

16:34.061 --> 16:37.030
*

16:37.064 --> 16:40.033
- 61 to Main, we need you to
roll out a Hazmat unit

16:40.067 --> 16:41.734
to 1100 South Lawndale Avenue.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.436
We got a chemical spill
in the basement.

16:43.470 --> 16:46.673
- Copy that, 61.
We'll notify Hazmat.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.642
*

16:49.676 --> 16:52.679
- Great job, Gemma.
- Thank you.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.314
Okay.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.718
There you go.
- Okay.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.523
- There we go.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.292
- Ah...

17:09.196 --> 17:10.497
- Okay.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.267
- Here we go.

17:14.301 --> 17:21.508
*

17:24.477 --> 17:25.812
- That should be fine.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.616
- I still don't know
what happened.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.751
- Well, you can't mix
chlorine and ammonia.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.654
They form chloramine,
which produces a toxic gas.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.357
- I had no idea, I was just
trying to clean the floor.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.126
- Well, now you know.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.462
- The air is clearing,

17:42.495 --> 17:44.331
we're ventilating
out the back windows.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.766
Ambient air quality should
stabilize in 20 minutes.

17:46.799 --> 17:49.102
Well, let's call it
an hour to be safe.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.637
- I will never do that again.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.240
- No problem, ma'am.
Just glad you're okay.

17:56.276 --> 17:59.712
*

17:59.746 --> 18:01.681
- Um, we're gonna route you to
Chicago Med,

18:01.714 --> 18:03.883
just to be doubly sure, and
Gemma's gonna ride with us.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.385
- Thank you.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.820
*

18:11.224 --> 18:14.227
Stella?
Yes!

18:14.261 --> 18:15.528
Yep!

18:17.730 --> 18:19.799
Okay.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.606
Yep.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.242
Still here.
- It's a total teardown.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.910
Chip and JoJo
would agree with me.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.845
Trudy and I

18:32.879 --> 18:35.515
have been turning the back
guest room into an Airbnb--

18:35.548 --> 18:37.550
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, thinking about it.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.386
In preparation,
I've been watching

18:39.419 --> 18:41.554
some DIY videos on plumbing.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.690
This might be a
mainline problem.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.926
- Mm. Do it yourself plumbing.
What could go wrong?

18:46.959 --> 18:51.331
- Pipe closet right on the
other side of that wall.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.939
Smell worse in there to you?

18:59.972 --> 19:01.741
- I can't smell anything
anymore.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.810
It's like my nostrils
just gave up.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.279
- Go get me
the toolbox from 81.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.880
- Gladly.

19:35.408 --> 19:42.615
*

19:54.694 --> 19:54.861
.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.603
- Yeah.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.872
We're firefighters
over at House 51.

20:05.905 --> 20:08.508
You have a patient here
that I'd like to visit,

20:08.541 --> 20:10.310
if that's possible.

20:11.678 --> 20:14.947
Pilar Valdez?
- You gotta be kidding me,

20:14.981 --> 20:16.549
Joe Cruz?
- Yeah!

20:16.583 --> 20:18.285
- I heard you
was a firefighter.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.419
- 12 years running.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.887
- Well, it looks
like it suits you.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.989
- Keeps me on my toes.
- Well, you always had a way.

20:23.022 --> 20:25.792
- I don't mean to interrupt--
- Well, you did.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.529
- Hey, uh, Pilar,

20:29.562 --> 20:30.663
can you help out
my lieutenant here?

20:30.697 --> 20:32.332
He just needs to see a patient.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.800
- And can I use your
bathroom?

20:38.070 --> 20:40.607
- Fill out the second page
and sign the bottom.

20:40.640 --> 20:44.577
I can't believe this.
Joe Cruz walks into my clinic!

20:44.611 --> 20:46.546
Right on the cusp
of Valentine's.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.915
- It is great to see you.

21:10.970 --> 21:13.072
- Mr. Jamison.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.409
- I know you--you're the one
that came in with the paramedic

21:16.443 --> 21:19.078
when I...

21:19.111 --> 21:21.013
You were her boyfriend?

21:21.047 --> 21:23.816
- Co-worker.
We, uh...

21:23.850 --> 21:26.819
we work at the same
firehouse.

21:30.890 --> 21:35.728
I just wanted to stop by and
ask about your daughter, Bria.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.330
No one's been able to find her,

21:37.364 --> 21:38.865
and I was hoping
that you could help.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.834
I know that she was planning
on coming to see you.

21:43.736 --> 21:46.105
- No.

21:46.138 --> 21:49.008
No, she didn't come.
Hey!

21:49.041 --> 21:50.543
Hey, Warren!

21:51.578 --> 21:54.381
- Hey, hush up in here.

21:54.414 --> 21:55.848
- Did my daughter
come to see me?

21:55.882 --> 21:57.684
- No.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.653
Hey, you stirring him up?

22:00.687 --> 22:02.522
- No--
- If so, you gotta go.

22:02.555 --> 22:03.890
- Thanks.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.897
I messed up!

22:10.930 --> 22:13.433
I messed up, and now
she's paying for it.

22:13.466 --> 22:15.602
How's that fair?

22:15.635 --> 22:17.637
- We'll find her.

22:19.071 --> 22:21.641
- I haven't told her.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.610
I haven't told her
it was my fault.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.679
I haven't told her that
I would do anything for her.

22:26.713 --> 22:30.750
I didn't have a chance,
and now she hates me!

22:30.783 --> 22:35.788
I know, and I can't
blame her, but--

22:35.822 --> 22:39.058
I have to tell her that it's
not her fault, none of it!

22:39.091 --> 22:43.563
*

22:43.596 --> 22:45.565
- She doesn't hate you.

22:47.467 --> 22:50.637
And she did come to visit you.

22:57.544 --> 23:04.651
*

23:13.693 --> 23:16.062
I know how hard this is.

23:18.698 --> 23:21.501
You get clean...

23:21.534 --> 23:23.102
and we'll make sure
to have her here

23:23.135 --> 23:25.004
for when you walk out.

23:25.037 --> 23:32.078
*

24:28.735 --> 24:30.870
- Um...

24:30.903 --> 24:33.205
are you Melinda Tripp?

24:33.239 --> 24:35.007
- I just wanted to ask--
- I paid my bills!

24:35.041 --> 24:37.777
- No, no, no, I'm not
a collector, um--

24:37.810 --> 24:40.913
I'm looking for
your niece, Bria.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.683
- You leave that girl alone!

24:43.716 --> 24:45.552
- Leave her alone!

24:45.585 --> 24:49.889
- Ma'am, I'm not the police,
I'm not a social worker, I'm--

24:49.922 --> 24:53.626
I'm a friend, and uh,
she's in trouble.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.027
*

24:56.295 --> 24:59.065
- Her father's in the hospital,
and he can't take care of her.

24:59.098 --> 25:00.299
- Good!

25:00.332 --> 25:02.301
She's better off without him.
- No, listen.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.836
Bria ran away.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.237
She's afraid to be
in the foster system,

25:05.271 --> 25:07.807
and now she's disappeared.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.910
- She's better off.

25:10.943 --> 25:13.212
- Safer that way!

25:15.081 --> 25:18.050
Won't end up like her mother.

25:18.084 --> 25:20.052
Mother...

25:20.086 --> 25:22.288
He drove her to it, you know.

25:23.890 --> 25:26.859
Chipped away, chipped away
at her every day.

25:31.063 --> 25:34.734
He didn't pull the trigger,
but he might as well have.

25:42.274 --> 25:44.644
- She's better off...

25:44.677 --> 25:46.946
Without him.

25:46.979 --> 25:49.816
- Ma'am, please,
what about Bria?

25:49.849 --> 25:53.085
She's alone!
She's scared to death!

25:53.119 --> 25:57.289
*

26:01.828 --> 26:02.161
.

26:02.194 --> 26:02.662
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.898
- I found her aunt.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.834
I can see why she's not
listed as a guardian.

26:07.867 --> 26:10.770
She's...off.

26:12.271 --> 26:15.808
- Said her sister was driven
to suicide by Bria's dad.

26:17.810 --> 26:19.178
- I was just with him.

26:19.211 --> 26:21.347
Whatever he was in the past,
I have no idea,

26:21.380 --> 26:24.617
but I know that he wants
to beat this for his daughter.

26:24.651 --> 26:27.019
- Yeah, well, she's not in
Joliet, I can tell you that.

26:27.053 --> 26:29.088
- She was here.
Maybe too scared

26:29.121 --> 26:30.623
to come in
through the front door,

26:30.657 --> 26:33.893
but she left him a note,
says she loves him.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.931
Okay.

26:38.965 --> 26:40.800
I'm on my way back.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.601
- All right, drive safe.

26:51.844 --> 26:55.782
- So you got your main line
and you got your water line,

26:55.815 --> 26:59.752
one goes to the sinks,
one goes from the toilets.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.854
- Make sure you pick
the right one.

27:01.888 --> 27:03.355
- Already taken
care of, Herrmann.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.992
I replaced the seals,
flushed the pipes,

27:06.025 --> 27:08.127
we should be good to go.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.800
- Then what are all
these extra pieces?

27:23.342 --> 27:25.077
- I have no idea.

27:25.111 --> 27:26.846
Found some tissues.
All's good.

27:26.879 --> 27:30.182
- All right, the smell's still
here. I can still smell it.

27:30.216 --> 27:33.019
- Yep, still gross.
- Ugh!

27:33.052 --> 27:36.055
- Why are there greasy gaskets
out in my firehouse corridor?

27:36.088 --> 27:39.992
- Oh, that's because Mr. Fix-It
over here, he decided to try

27:40.026 --> 27:42.695
and flush out the sewer line.

27:45.331 --> 27:48.868
- Question two--
who called headquarters

27:48.901 --> 27:50.703
saying that they were
a whistleblower

27:50.737 --> 27:53.806
and that maybe we had
black mold here at 51?

27:56.308 --> 27:58.778
- Hmm.

27:58.811 --> 28:01.748
- Hey, Chief, Stella and I just
got back from a call today,

28:01.781 --> 28:03.315
and the Hazmat
unit was amazing.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.885
And see, there's this
lieutenant in that unit--

28:05.918 --> 28:07.720
I think the name on his
sleeve was Zach.

28:07.754 --> 28:10.422
- Definitely,
definitely was Zach.

28:10.456 --> 28:11.991
- Anyway, I could
call over there

28:12.024 --> 28:14.026
and see if Zach could
stop by as a favor.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.062
- Which is a great idea!

28:19.098 --> 28:20.299
*

28:20.332 --> 28:21.834
- Okay, fine.

28:21.868 --> 28:25.304
*

28:26.939 --> 28:29.275
*

28:29.308 --> 28:33.045
- Hi! Hi, Zach, it's
Sylvie Brett from 51.

28:33.079 --> 28:36.315
We're the paramedics who were
on your basement call today--

28:36.348 --> 28:38.284
Oh, you do. Oh, okay.

28:38.317 --> 28:41.888
Listen,
uh, we're having some...

28:41.921 --> 28:44.857
olfactory issues here
at the firehouse,

28:44.891 --> 28:47.059
and I was wondering if--

28:47.093 --> 28:49.328
Oh, ha.
You would.

28:49.361 --> 28:51.931
Um, great.
See you in a minute.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.401
He's headed over.
- Great!

28:55.434 --> 28:59.872
'Cause I am gonna ask him
out as soon as he gets here.

28:59.906 --> 29:02.241
It was my idea to call him.

29:02.274 --> 29:03.442
I was gonna ask him out.

29:03.475 --> 29:06.012
- Oh, well,
I already called dibs.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.814
- Well, you don't just--
you don't just call dibs.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.916
- Well, he was checking me out
on the call, so--

29:09.949 --> 29:12.218
- I think he was
checking me out, besides--

29:12.251 --> 29:14.153
- Brett, listen.
I need this.

29:14.186 --> 29:16.956
I have had zero luck
in love this year.

29:16.989 --> 29:21.928
Zero! I-I live with a guy
who has firmly stuck me

29:21.961 --> 29:23.429
in the friend zone, so--

29:23.462 --> 29:25.898
- Um, I need this too.
- Mmm...

29:25.932 --> 29:28.500
- I just broke up
with Antonio again.

29:28.534 --> 29:33.505
And I would really like
to forget about him, so--

29:33.539 --> 29:37.476
- Yeah, well,
I'm not giving in.

29:37.509 --> 29:40.579
- Neither am I.

29:40.612 --> 29:44.383
- Well, you can take
your ruby slippers

29:44.416 --> 29:47.053
and land a house on them.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.923
- Hey, Matt,
I guess I missed you.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.859
Uh, listen, I--

29:52.892 --> 29:55.261
I, uh, I know
I've been distant lately,

29:55.294 --> 29:58.264
and that's my fault.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.132
And I'm sorry.

30:00.166 --> 30:03.035
I'll catch you up on
everything tonight, I promise.

30:03.069 --> 30:04.336
I love you, babe.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.575
*

30:09.608 --> 30:11.911
Hey, Matt,
I guess I missed you.

30:11.944 --> 30:13.612
Uh, listen, I--

30:13.645 --> 30:16.115
I, uh, I know
I've been distant lately,

30:16.148 --> 30:18.217
and that's my fault.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.552
- Thank you.

30:20.586 --> 30:22.588
- Chief.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.958
I've been thinking.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.361
- Come on in.

30:31.998 --> 30:34.166
- As soon as you get
out of touch with someone,

30:34.200 --> 30:38.137
you feel like you've distanced
yourself from their concern,

30:38.170 --> 30:40.572
their problems...

30:40.606 --> 30:43.342
what were inches between
you can grow into miles.

30:43.375 --> 30:46.012
*

30:46.045 --> 30:49.916
I been doing a little bit
too much of that lately.

30:49.949 --> 30:51.483
Distancing myself.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.953
So I don't want this
to come out the wrong way,

30:53.986 --> 30:55.955
and I really
appreciate the offer,

30:55.988 --> 30:59.591
but, uh, I think I'm gonna
stay in my old quarters

30:59.625 --> 31:01.994
so I can be close to my men.

31:02.028 --> 31:03.963
- Okay then.

31:03.996 --> 31:06.098
I'll admit
I'm a little jealous.

31:06.132 --> 31:07.599
When I made Battalion Chief,

31:07.633 --> 31:09.936
I was very happy to get to
this end of the firehouse.

31:09.969 --> 31:13.372
No more snoring men,
no more coughs and sneezes

31:13.405 --> 31:17.109
at 4:00 in the a.m. just as
I finally got my eyes closed.

31:17.143 --> 31:22.181
It was a place to come, shut my
door, and not be bothered.

31:22.214 --> 31:27.186
But it turns out...sometimes
I miss being bothered.

31:29.121 --> 31:31.657
Sometimes I miss those
sneezes and snores.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.327
- Well, I can send
Mouch down here

31:35.361 --> 31:36.628
tonight if you want, Chief.

31:36.662 --> 31:38.998
- You do that, and
I will take those bugles

31:39.031 --> 31:40.967
from your collar
my damn self.

31:41.000 --> 31:47.839
*

31:51.710 --> 31:53.980
- Hi, Zach,
I'm the one who called.

31:54.013 --> 31:56.115
- Yes, she is always
calling men.

31:56.148 --> 31:58.985
All the time.
Anyway, I'm Stella Kidd,

31:59.018 --> 32:01.120
and it is just so great
to see you again.

32:01.153 --> 32:04.256
- I'm...Sylvie.

32:04.290 --> 32:06.092
I literally never,
ever call men.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.259
I don't know what
she's talking about.

32:11.697 --> 32:14.300
- Oh, oh, it's uh, yeah--

32:14.333 --> 32:17.970
- Oh, hey, welcome to 51!

32:18.004 --> 32:21.273
- Yep, we got a mystery odor,
and for once,

32:21.307 --> 32:23.142
it's not coming from Otis.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.711
- Yeah, I can smell it.

32:25.744 --> 32:28.714
All right, this is one
of my favorite toys.

32:28.747 --> 32:30.549
It works like a super-nose.

32:30.582 --> 32:33.019
Fruit companies use them
to identify rotting fruit

32:33.052 --> 32:36.555
in big batches--we use them to
identify dead bodies in rubble.

32:38.224 --> 32:41.227
- You know, I got a
Japanese firefighting robot

32:41.260 --> 32:45.164
that actually has over
200 temperature gauges.

32:45.197 --> 32:48.534
[beeping increases
in frequency]

32:54.106 --> 32:56.642
- It's in here.

32:58.744 --> 33:00.312
Your walls
are thick concrete tile,

33:00.346 --> 33:03.315
but these dividers
are painted to match.

33:03.349 --> 33:04.583
Must be hollow.

33:04.616 --> 33:07.186
Someone get me a
chisel and a mallet.

33:07.219 --> 33:10.122
- Oh, you were quick.

33:10.156 --> 33:11.123
- So quick.

33:11.157 --> 33:12.591
- I'm so grateful
we called you.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.060
Great idea I had.

33:14.093 --> 33:16.562
- It was my idea, actually.

33:19.298 --> 33:20.732
- Thanks.

33:24.103 --> 33:25.237
Okay.

33:37.516 --> 33:40.352
Yeah, feel something.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.488
Uh-oh.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.556
I think it's a dead critter.

33:44.590 --> 33:47.259
I can just reach...

33:47.293 --> 33:49.661
where it is...yeah.

33:50.562 --> 33:52.131
Oof.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.308
- Hey, guys.

34:02.341 --> 34:05.311
So, ugh, what's the verdict?

34:05.344 --> 34:07.246
- We found the smell!

34:07.279 --> 34:13.285
*

34:17.256 --> 34:17.389
.

34:17.423 --> 34:18.324
- I'll just dispose
of this on my way back.

34:19.691 --> 34:21.460
- Thank you so
much for your help.

34:21.493 --> 34:24.730
- Uh, you may have to come back
and look for two more bodies

34:24.763 --> 34:26.165
stuffed into the walls!

34:26.198 --> 34:28.800
- Okay, look, Mr. Sprinkles
got away.

34:28.834 --> 34:31.103
We didn't want to break
your kid's heart.

34:31.137 --> 34:34.140
- Ah, I'm gonna break
something, all right.

34:41.413 --> 34:45.784
- Truck 81!
Bunkroom, now, please!

34:49.588 --> 34:50.889
- Okay.

34:50.922 --> 34:54.460
Uh, well, thanks, Zach.
- Yeah.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.262
Sure.
- Mm-hmm.

34:56.295 --> 34:57.829
- Okay.

35:01.200 --> 35:05.171
- Um, so listen,
my friend, Stella,

35:05.204 --> 35:07.473
the tall one who
was just here--

35:07.506 --> 35:08.540
- I remember.

35:08.574 --> 35:10.876
- She's, uh--

35:13.845 --> 35:16.182
She's fantastic.

35:17.183 --> 35:19.117
I just thought
you should know that.

35:30.329 --> 35:33.765
- Uh...yeah.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.501
- Listen up!

35:35.534 --> 35:37.369
I want all the bunks
back where they go.

35:37.403 --> 35:39.871
I want that hole covered
until we get it repaired.

35:39.905 --> 35:42.341
I want the plumbing closet
in the hall cleaned up

35:42.374 --> 35:44.410
and looking the way it did
when we started shift.

35:44.443 --> 35:45.844
Are we clear?

35:45.877 --> 35:48.380
all: Aye-aye, Captain!

35:49.481 --> 35:51.717
- Okay, here we go.

35:51.750 --> 35:54.186
There will be no humming
while we work!

35:54.220 --> 35:56.888
- Okay.
Can we whistle?

35:56.922 --> 35:58.857
- O, Captain! My, Captain!

35:58.890 --> 36:00.392
- Oh!
- We're fishing!

36:00.426 --> 36:02.328
- It's an improvement!

36:02.361 --> 36:03.729
Cindy's gonna wonder
where I've been!

36:03.762 --> 36:06.532
- You act like
you smell so good!

36:06.565 --> 36:10.402
*

36:10.436 --> 36:13.672
[indistinct conversation,
laughter]

36:13.705 --> 36:16.975
*

36:17.008 --> 36:19.411
- I appreciate your zest!

36:19.445 --> 36:23.482
Okay, all right.
- We gotta move it! Let's go!

36:23.515 --> 36:26.552
- Hey! Captain!

36:26.585 --> 36:28.820
- Yay!

36:30.722 --> 36:34.293
- Guys, Lily was
so nice to do this.

36:34.326 --> 36:37.463
A fitting tribute
for our wall of fame.

36:42.401 --> 36:45.771
I'll put it right next to
Burgess' bulletproof vest!

36:45.804 --> 36:47.773
- Har-har.

36:47.806 --> 36:50.776
That animal died
because of you nitwits!

36:50.809 --> 36:53.612
- Actually,
he sacrificed itself

36:53.645 --> 36:56.648
for the greater good.
Because of my--

36:56.682 --> 37:00.519
Because of the anonymous
whistleblower call,

37:00.552 --> 37:05.924
headquarters has approved brand
new mattresses for the bunks!

37:12.798 --> 37:16.835
Let's go!

37:16.868 --> 37:18.970
200 bucks, each of you.

37:20.839 --> 37:22.874
- The Chicago Humane Society,

37:22.908 --> 37:26.244
or you are never drinking
at Molly's again!

37:28.480 --> 37:29.815
Come on!

37:29.848 --> 37:32.918
Cough it up! Dig!

37:32.951 --> 37:35.654
There you go. You too.

37:35.687 --> 37:37.989
- It's a good cause!

37:41.860 --> 37:43.629
Guess what, Dorothy?

37:43.662 --> 37:47.733
I just got a call from Zach,
the handsome Hazmat guy.

37:47.766 --> 37:48.967
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm!

37:49.000 --> 37:51.437
And we are going on
a date tomorrow night!

37:51.470 --> 37:53.939
- I'm happy for you.
He seems terrific.

37:53.972 --> 37:56.375
- Mm-hmm.

37:56.408 --> 37:58.009
Mm-hmm...

37:59.478 --> 38:01.447
- Wait a second.

38:03.014 --> 38:05.584
What did you say to him
when I had to go back inside?

38:05.617 --> 38:07.519
- Nothing.
- Nothing, nothing.

38:07.553 --> 38:09.388
What'd you say?

38:09.421 --> 38:13.325
Mm!
God, you felt sorry for me,

38:13.359 --> 38:14.893
and so you told him
to ask me out.

38:14.926 --> 38:17.996
- No, no, he asked
for your number.

38:18.029 --> 38:21.767
I just...I told him
you were fantastic.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.035
Which you are, so...

38:25.371 --> 38:26.505
- Mm.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.009
Mm!

38:31.042 --> 38:32.444
You're the best!

38:34.746 --> 38:36.682
- Talked to Antonio,
told him about the aunt.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.417
He ran a quick vet on her,

38:38.450 --> 38:39.851
and she's got a history
of mental illness.

38:41.687 --> 38:44.022
- He also read me the police
report on the mom.

38:44.055 --> 38:46.024
She did kill herself.

38:46.057 --> 38:48.760
Bria was only six.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.365
- Self-inflicted gunshot.

38:53.399 --> 38:55.367
Father and daughter
weren't home at the time.

38:55.401 --> 38:57.636
The neighbors saw the mom
go in, heard the shot,

38:57.669 --> 39:00.372
called the police.

39:00.406 --> 39:01.940
Anyway...

39:03.141 --> 39:06.111
It's gotta be brutal
for the both of them.

39:12.918 --> 39:15.654
Hello?

39:15.687 --> 39:17.789
Yeah, this is she.

39:17.823 --> 39:19.625
Uh-huh.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.862
*

39:23.895 --> 39:26.398
Can you describe her?

39:30.969 --> 39:32.671
Okay, yeah,
I'll be right there.

39:38.444 --> 39:41.046
- That was the morgue, um...

39:41.079 --> 39:43.181
A Jane Doe teenage girl
just rolled in.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.517
She had my card in her purse.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.922
- Hey, I'll take her.

39:50.956 --> 39:58.129
*
