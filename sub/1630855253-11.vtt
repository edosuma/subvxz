We have an update now to our top story.</i>

00:22.564 --> 00:26.026
<i>It's been almost eight months
since the deaths of more than 700 people</i>

with many bodies still unrecovered.</i>

00:30.321 --> 00:34.576
<i>While the scientific community continues
to dive into the cause of the fissures,</i>

00:34.576 --> 00:40.331

is linked to the passengers of Flight 828.</i>

<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

01:38.681 --> 01:40.934
Hey, go easy with that cheese, okay?

01:40.934 --> 01:44.437
We have to make this all last
until payday.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.439
I know. I'm not a baby.

01:46.439 --> 01:50.735
[Olive] Oh. Okay. Well, did you know
that cheese makes you fart?

01:50.735 --> 01:52.112
[laughs]

01:53.655 --> 01:54.906
No sad faces, okay?

01:54.906 --> 01:57.325
Tuesdays are happy days.

01:57.325 --> 01:58.785
Not for Gabriel.

01:59.744 --> 02:04.415
Okay, I know these past eight months
have been really hard on you,

02:04.415 --> 02:07.001
but you're alive and well,

02:07.001 --> 02:11.631
and nobody knows that you're a passenger,
and I don't know what I'd do without you.

02:13.091 --> 02:15.927
Go pick out an outfit, okay? Okay.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.764
So, what's up?

02:21.224 --> 02:23.852
When I woke up, my heart was racing.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.186
I was sweating.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.772
I had this nightmare,
but I can't remember it.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.399
Okay.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.235
And my scar, it glowed.

02:32.986 --> 02:33.820
For real?

02:35.029 --> 02:36.573
Your scar hasn't glowed since--

02:36.573 --> 02:39.993
...I destroyed the Omega Sapphire.
And then again, when Zeke...

02:42.328 --> 02:45.957
- But it's the first time in eight months.
<i>-</i> Yeah, it has to mean something.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.667
Do you like my dress?

02:47.667 --> 02:49.794
I love it. You're gonna look beautiful.

Another Calling gone unsolved.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.796
Okay, extricate them from the pod,

05:38.796 --> 05:42.091
and can you log in the results
before they're released back to gen pop?

05:42.592 --> 05:44.427
What do you think they do with the data?

05:44.427 --> 05:48.056
I have no idea. The less I ask,
the longer I can stay in the lab

We haven't had meals

07:22.108 --> 07:24.235
but I've seen him in the yard.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.154
Looks good.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.573
I know he misses you.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.452
How's Gabriel?

07:33.244 --> 07:36.122
I know he had a follow-up
with Dr. Bates this week, right?

07:36.122 --> 07:37.498
He's completely healthy.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.626
Actually, he's...

07:41.836 --> 07:43.087
he's even glowing.

So sorry. It's time to go.

- A few more minutes.
- Nothing I can do.

08:07.612 --> 08:08.446

Olive is trying her best
to hold it together for Eden.

09:11.676 --> 09:15.680
I don't know. Maybe I'm doing more harm
than good by having them visit me here.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.266
I mean, I should be the one going to them.

09:19.183 --> 09:20.726
I hate not seeing Cal.

09:21.477 --> 09:23.479
Olive says he's feeling better.

Still in remission.

Did you hear what I said?

09:34.907 --> 09:38.703
[sighs] Sorry, I'm just... just tired today.

09:39.870 --> 09:40.746
[Ben] Today?

09:41.706 --> 09:42.999
Try every day.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.002
I get up. I eat.

Shower, sleep, rinse, repeat.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.593
- Ben, what do you want from me?
- You never talk about Zeke.

09:54.385 --> 09:55.428
[sighs]

09:55.428 --> 09:57.763
You're holding on
to your grief so tight, it's...

09:58.264 --> 10:00.600
- I don't know. It's taking a toll, Mick.
- I'm fine.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.477
You're gonna fall apart.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.565
Believe me. I know how it works.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.405
I miss him every single second
of every day.

10:15.197 --> 10:18.492
I can't wait to go to bed at night

10:18.492 --> 10:20.578
just so that I'm not in pain.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.955
And when I wake up
and he's not next to me,

10:23.998 --> 10:25.583
my heart breaks all over again.

10:33.758 --> 10:34.759
I'm here for you.

10:38.554 --> 10:42.892
And I need to know
you'll be here for me. For all of us.

Moon and back.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.603

to save the passengers.

we get the hell out of here.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.573
Cal's glow is back, Vance.

15:08.782 --> 15:09.950
It's time.

15:12.453 --> 15:16.290
I just cleared the mess hall.
Service entrance is still open.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.003
- Thank you.
- We owe you one.

15:21.003 --> 15:25.132
I stopped counting how many you owe me.
Remember, you never saw me.

15:41.148 --> 15:43.192
Package's been delivered.
Thought you'd like to know.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.653
Good, make sure to notify Dr. Gupta ASAP.

15:47.321 --> 15:50.908
Well, that wasn't ominous in the least.
What package were we expecting?

15:50.908 --> 15:53.035
It's need to know,
and you don't need to know.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.831
We can't help solve Bethany's Calling
if we don't know what it is.

15:57.831 --> 15:59.833
- [door opens]
- Where are we on Bethany Collins?

15:59.833 --> 16:03.462
Zimmer, like I told your Callings Unit,
Bethany was oversedated.

16:03.462 --> 16:04.964
All we can do now is wait.

16:04.964 --> 16:09.301
Not all we can do. Bethany was hell-bent
on saving her wife, Georgia Davis.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.720
Visitor log shows
that Georgia was here yesterday.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.431
Yeah, we pulled her contact info
from Bethany's file.

16:14.431 --> 16:16.350
Get out in the field. Do a wellness check.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.559
[Zimmer] Don't screw this up.

16:17.559 --> 16:20.646
The NSA can't have the Callings Unit
dropping any more balls.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.898
Believe it or not,
we don't try to fail at this.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.942
If you cared about
helping the passengers--

16:24.942 --> 16:27.027
I don't. The priority is to study them.

16:27.027 --> 16:30.280
Your job is to gather data to figure out
how the Callings are transmitted.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.282
That's all I care about.

16:32.282 --> 16:33.200
Understood?

16:37.287 --> 16:38.288
[door opens]

16:38.872 --> 16:39.707
[door closes]

16:39.707 --> 16:43.085
Now that I have the two of you alone,
I have some concerns.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.378
Namely, the isolation pod.

16:44.378 --> 16:45.921
- What?
- [Saanvi] It's barbaric.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.007
Experiencing a Calling
is unsettling enough,

16:48.007 --> 16:52.636
but strapping passengers to fMRI machines
for an unspecified amount of time...

16:52.636 --> 16:55.305
I mean, it is no wonder
Bethany didn't wanna cooperate.

16:55.305 --> 16:58.976
The time is not unspecified.
It's simply until the Calling is resolved.

16:58.976 --> 17:02.146
[Saanvi] We are not resolving
enough Callings to survive the Death Date.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.690
And like it or not,
that includes the rest of the world.

17:04.690 --> 17:08.152
Why not reconsider my proposal
to get the passengers day passes,

17:08.152 --> 17:11.447
put them in the field supervised
until their Callings are complete?

17:11.447 --> 17:12.698
Absolutely not.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.700
We need to let the 828ers help us.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.161
If Saanvi is right,
we have everything to lose.

17:17.786 --> 17:21.498
And if she's wrong, then we just
helped keep the streets a little safer.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.542
We're controlling the situation.

17:23.542 --> 17:27.880
Speaking of which, we have a plan
to find the 13 fugitive passengers.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.967
NSA and Homeland Security
have joined forces.

17:31.967 --> 17:36.013
Authorized a $50,000 reward
for each wanted 828er.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.601
Is that dead or alive?

17:40.601 --> 17:45.022
You just activated every nut job wannabe
to become a bounty hunter.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.232
Your lack of respect
is starting to test my limits.

17:47.232 --> 17:51.779
You're not exactly showing
much compassion about this situation.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.739
And you're lucky to be here.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.285
[door opens]

17:58.869 --> 18:01.288
- [door closes]
- Have you heard from Dr. Gupta?

18:02.331 --> 18:04.583
No, not since she stabbed us in the back.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.835
- Why?
- No reason.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.422
Well, thank you for your time, Dr. Bahl.

18:15.677 --> 18:16.804
You helped them.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.348
You have access to the database
and their schedules.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.558
Hide the ball as long as you can.

18:25.479 --> 18:26.605
[Olive] <i>This isn't possible.</i>

18:27.689 --> 18:29.483
Why did they let you guys out?

18:30.234 --> 18:32.361
- Daddy!
- [Ben] Baby, come here.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.155
[chuckles]

18:35.989 --> 18:36.907
Hey, Cal.

18:38.242 --> 18:41.078
- Let me look at you.
- What? I'm fine, Dad. Honestly.

18:41.578 --> 18:44.248
[Ben] Glowing again, huh?
Any Calling to go with it?

18:44.248 --> 18:47.835
No, nothing since...
since Zeke saved my life.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.337
Something definitely changed today.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.256
We gotta hustle. Got a Calling to solve.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.007
- Are the passenger--
- [Olive] Hold up!

18:54.007 --> 18:56.218
You guys never answered my question.

18:56.885 --> 18:59.138
Why did the Registry let you out?

19:02.766 --> 19:06.520
Uh, Eden,
would you go draw Daddy a picture?

19:07.062 --> 19:07.938
Thank you.

19:10.357 --> 19:15.279
It's not so much that they let us out.
More like we just left.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.990
- [Cal] You did what?
- There's no time to get into it.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.158
Bethany's wife's in trouble,

19:19.158 --> 19:21.535
which is why we need
to gather as much intel as we can find.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.078
It could be why you're glowing again.

19:23.579 --> 19:26.915
So please...
Please tell me you kept my research.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.793
O ye of little faith.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.551
[Ben chuckles]

19:41.054 --> 19:42.723
We never gave up on you, Dad.

19:43.807 --> 19:46.226
We decided it'd be easier
to move everything down here

19:46.226 --> 19:47.477
and keep an eye on Eden.

19:47.477 --> 19:49.938
Apples didn't fall far from the tree.

19:51.273 --> 19:54.193
- [Michaela] Hey, I found Georgia's number.
- [phone beeping]

19:54.902 --> 19:56.153
[tones play]

19:56.153 --> 19:58.614
[robotic voice] <i>We're sorry.
You have reached a number that--</i>

19:58.614 --> 19:59.698
It's disconnected.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.451
Maybe an old number.
I know Georgia's around.

20:02.451 --> 20:03.994
I saw her visiting Bethany yesterday.

20:03.994 --> 20:06.914
Okay, we have the address.
Uh, is the car gassed up?

20:08.123 --> 20:09.583
Um...

20:09.583 --> 20:11.960
- Um, we sold the car.
- Shit.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.795
- What?
- [Cal] We had to.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.215
It was either electricity and food
or wheels.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.716
Why didn't you say anything?

20:17.716 --> 20:20.093
And stress you guys out even more?

20:20.093 --> 20:23.055
Grandpa Steve cashed in his pension
to try to get a lawyer

20:23.055 --> 20:24.848
to get you guys out of there.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.016
We both have jobs.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.477
And I'm watching Eden.
We're making it work.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.854
We're so sorry.
We will make this up to you.

20:30.854 --> 20:33.440
It's no time for a pity party.
You guys need to find Georgia.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.527
Take my phone. You'll need it.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.366
Thank you. Well, we still need a car.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.534
I think I know someone. Let's go.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.956
Daddy, don't go.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.040
Oh, baby.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.710
Daddy will be back. Okay?

20:53.710 --> 20:55.045
Promise you.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.681
[indistinct chatter]

21:11.979 --> 21:14.564
Um... [inhales deeply]

21:16.692 --> 21:18.235
Okay, one down.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.989
Ah, that's...
Oh, that's chicken alfredo, okay.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.575
[woman over P.A.]
<i>Custodial staff to entrance.</i>

21:27.995 --> 21:30.038
I'm so sorry
to show up unannounced like this.

21:30.038 --> 21:31.581
You're here. How could--

21:31.581 --> 21:33.166
- How'd-- What?
- [Ben] Thank you.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.419
The less you know, the better.

21:36.837 --> 21:40.132
But, um... we have a favor to ask.

21:41.633 --> 21:42.926
We need to borrow your car.

21:42.926 --> 21:45.429
Just for a few hours. Nothing nefarious.

21:46.013 --> 21:48.515
Now that I listen to myself,
it sounds nefarious.

21:48.515 --> 21:52.185
But we would not be asking
unless it was absolutely necessary.

21:52.185 --> 21:55.981
When you married Zeke,
you became a part of our family.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.983
That hasn't changed.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.193
Let me grab the keys.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.080
Oh, they were both so young.

22:13.540 --> 22:14.624
I can't imagine.

22:32.642 --> 22:33.518
[Michaela] Oh my God.

22:35.896 --> 22:36.855
Thank you.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.775
- No.
- No, it's for the kids.

22:39.775 --> 22:42.069
That's incredibly generous of you.
Thank you.

22:43.653 --> 22:47.324
Zeke and Chloe read together a lot,

22:47.324 --> 22:50.243
and I kept all their old books.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.496
I suppose that seems silly.

22:54.122 --> 22:55.791
I found this inside.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.723
Lilies were our favorite.

23:14.935 --> 23:18.146
All this time,
I had no idea this even existed.

23:18.647 --> 23:19.898
Thank you so much.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.402
You have no idea how much this means.

23:26.321 --> 23:27.531
Thank you for the car.

23:31.952 --> 23:32.911
Be safe.

23:33.954 --> 23:34.996
[door opens]

23:36.206 --> 23:37.165
[door closes]

23:38.875 --> 23:40.877
[sentimental music plays]

23:45.841 --> 23:47.843
[indistinct chatter]

24:04.985 --> 24:07.195
- What's up?
- Safety check.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.239
Michaela Stone's
supposed to be in the yard.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.949
This is where she last scanned in.

24:10.949 --> 24:14.202
If you had to eat at the mess hall,
you'd be in here too.

24:14.911 --> 24:17.747
I'm certain Zimmer would agree.
This is an invasion of privacy.

24:17.747 --> 24:20.709
You are heading
into highly inappropriate territory--

24:20.709 --> 24:23.086
[suspenseful music plays]

24:23.086 --> 24:24.004
[Saanvi sighs]

24:24.004 --> 24:26.173
Level 5 breach. Inmate has escaped.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.967
I repeat. Level 5 breach.
Inmate has escaped.

24:28.967 --> 24:29.885
[alarm blares]

24:32.971 --> 24:36.308
- [Jared] So, what you doing later?
- [Drea] I know <i>who</i> I'm not doing.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.852
Okay, wow,
thought we were just having fun.

24:39.728 --> 24:43.732
- I don't remember hearing any complaints.
- Okay, we talked about this weeks ago.

24:43.732 --> 24:47.110
Us working together, sleeping together...
It's too codependent. No strings attached.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.488
- Right. Lone wolf.
- Exactly. Yeah.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.655
[crash]

24:51.281 --> 24:52.115
Georgia?

24:56.203 --> 24:57.871
- Police!
- [Drea] Hands up, asshole!

25:00.874 --> 25:04.628
Wicks, what the hell, man?
We thought Georgia was in danger.

25:04.628 --> 25:08.131
Why would we trust a passenger's wife?
She might be the danger.

25:08.131 --> 25:11.968
You're the literal definition of bad cop.
You guys don't even have a warrant.

25:11.968 --> 25:14.471
We're Registry.
Nobody's gonna question us.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.598
- What are you looking for?
- I'll know when I see it.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.183
Great. So keep tossing the place.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.602
You never know.
This place could be a trap.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.147
Yep, that's exactly
what this place looks like.

25:24.147 --> 25:26.149
<i>- Better Homes & Traps.</i>
- [laughs mockingly]

25:26.149 --> 25:28.443
- [phone chimes]
- What, more exciting news?

25:28.443 --> 25:31.446
Two passengers escaped
from the detention center.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.907
[Wicks] Michaela and Ben Stone.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.827
Head back. I'll ride with these two.

25:38.787 --> 25:42.165
Guessing they know a thing or two
about where our fugitives are heading.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.596
[high-pitched whistle]

25:59.099 --> 26:00.308
[thunder rumbles]

26:04.396 --> 26:06.856
[Georgia] <i>Ah! Help me! Help!</i>

26:07.607 --> 26:08.942
[screams]

26:08.942 --> 26:10.569
<i>Help me!</i>

26:11.069 --> 26:13.071
[crying]

26:13.071 --> 26:14.990
[thunder rumbling]

26:19.119 --> 26:21.079
[Georgia] <i>Bethany!</i>

26:21.079 --> 26:23.540
<i>Bethany, help!</i>

26:25.584 --> 26:27.210
[beeping]

26:30.088 --> 26:31.548
[Georgia] <i>Bethany!</i>

26:31.548 --> 26:33.550
[beeping continues]

26:33.550 --> 26:36.386
- What's going on?
<i>-</i> We got an alert she's having a Calling.

26:36.386 --> 26:38.805
Bethany is exhibiting signs of a Calling,

26:38.805 --> 26:41.641
but she is still incapacitated,
thanks to heavy sedation,

26:41.641 --> 26:44.144
so she can't share with us
what she's seeing.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.523
Notify me the moment she awakens.

26:54.821 --> 26:57.073
We could literally be running
into the Registry police.

26:57.073 --> 26:58.658
Then it's been a nice day out.

26:58.658 --> 27:01.453
I wish we would've stopped
for Gray's Papaya.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.912
[Georgia crying]

27:03.622 --> 27:05.957
Georgia? Georgia!

27:07.751 --> 27:11.421
No, no. No, it's okay. It's okay.
We're friends of Bethany's from 828.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.757
[panting]

27:15.091 --> 27:16.718
Georgia, what happened in here?

27:17.677 --> 27:19.012
The Registry happened.

27:19.554 --> 27:22.057
I got home just in time
to see them leaving.

27:22.057 --> 27:26.269
Bastards tossed my life,
'cause that's what I needed today.

27:29.272 --> 27:31.274
[crying]

27:34.235 --> 27:35.153
Can I see?

27:42.202 --> 27:43.620
You both look beautiful.

27:47.248 --> 27:48.958
How are you not in detention?

27:50.502 --> 27:52.295
We, uh, slipped out.

27:53.254 --> 27:56.132
- Bethany was worried about you.
- You mean she had a Calling.

27:56.716 --> 27:59.511
She's helped us over and over.
We had to solve it for her.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.012
She means a lot to us.

28:01.596 --> 28:03.598
Which means that you mean a lot to us too.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.351
[phone ringing]

28:07.560 --> 28:08.395
Olive?

28:08.395 --> 28:12.148
I had a Calling.
Well, not my Calling. Bethany's Calling.

28:13.441 --> 28:14.401
What did you see?

28:14.401 --> 28:15.568
[Cal] <i>I was on the plane,</i>

28:15.568 --> 28:19.364
and I saw an apple on Bethany's seat,
and I just knew to sit in her seat.

28:19.364 --> 28:22.075
Then I saw this open field.

28:22.075 --> 28:24.786
<i>I could hear screaming,
and it was near this, like, old barn.</i>

28:24.786 --> 28:26.788
<i>At least, I think that's what it was.</i>

28:26.788 --> 28:30.542
And I saw a car, a red car with guns.

28:31.167 --> 28:32.627
<i>Lots of guns in the back seat.</i>

28:33.211 --> 28:34.379
Georgia, what is it?

28:35.213 --> 28:38.758
Yeah, it's Vasik. The young dad
with the wife and two kids.

28:38.758 --> 28:39.759
The 828er.

28:39.759 --> 28:42.470
- He's one of the 13 fugitives.
- [Georgia] He reached out for help.

28:42.470 --> 28:45.598
I was supposed to meet him
at an old barn in Conklin.

28:45.598 --> 28:48.435
Well, then, he's in danger.
You need to go now.

29:19.507 --> 29:22.552
So why don't you tell us
what we're doing way the hell out here?

29:23.511 --> 29:24.763
Anson asked for help.

29:25.847 --> 29:26.806
It's what I do.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.350
Less you know, the better.

29:31.227 --> 29:33.396
I'll check the perimeter.
You guys go look for Anson.

29:55.043 --> 29:55.960
Anson?

29:58.338 --> 29:59.631
Anson, it's Georgia.

30:08.223 --> 30:11.184
Anson! You gotta get out of here!
It's not safe!

30:12.685 --> 30:13.686
That's not Anson.

30:24.239 --> 30:26.282
Come out, come out wherever you are.

30:29.077 --> 30:31.079
Here, kitty kitty.

30:32.914 --> 30:35.250
Don't make it harder than it has to be.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.126
I see you.

30:40.171 --> 30:41.130
Game over.

30:42.340 --> 30:44.425
It sure is, asshole. Drop the weapon.

30:45.134 --> 30:47.136
Oh, yeah? You gonna shoot me, cop?

30:47.846 --> 30:49.514
[sighs] It's Billy, right?

30:50.098 --> 30:51.182
Listen, Billy.

30:51.182 --> 30:54.435
Just to refresh your memory,
that was my husband that you kidnapped

30:54.435 --> 30:56.896
and nearly killed at the Xer bar
all those years ago,

30:56.896 --> 30:59.440
which is why I would love nothing more

30:59.440 --> 31:01.943
than the tiniest justifiable reason

31:01.943 --> 31:04.362
to rid the world of a scumbag like you.

31:04.863 --> 31:08.199
I'm not the bitch you want holding a gun
to the back of your head right now.

31:11.578 --> 31:13.371
[suspenseful music swells]

31:19.252 --> 31:20.336
Come on, guys.

31:20.336 --> 31:24.173
Olive, your dad and aunt could be
in serious danger. Help us protect them.

31:24.173 --> 31:28.636
I haven't seen my dad since yesterday,
through a plexiglass wall,

31:28.636 --> 31:30.847
same as the week before.

31:30.847 --> 31:33.141
Gabe, what about you?

31:33.141 --> 31:36.352
I haven't seen them
since they got locked up eight months ago.

31:37.061 --> 31:39.898
You were mixed up
with that dead passenger girl last year.

31:39.898 --> 31:40.815
Violet?

31:41.316 --> 31:44.110
You do realize if you're hiding anything,
we're gonna find out.

31:44.110 --> 31:47.280
Okay, does it look like
we have time to play games?

31:47.280 --> 31:49.365
We're struggling to feed ourselves here.

31:49.365 --> 31:52.660
Hey, they're smart kids.
They're not gonna lie to law enforcement.

31:52.660 --> 31:53.828
Come on. Let's go.

31:53.828 --> 31:55.788
We want an update on the daily.

32:04.005 --> 32:05.465
Is your daddy back?

32:06.424 --> 32:08.509
- Where the hell are they?
- We don't know.

32:11.346 --> 32:12.180
We're taking 'em in.

32:12.180 --> 32:15.892
- What don't you understand about warrants?
- They're in contact with him somehow.

32:16.559 --> 32:17.435
Take their phones.

32:23.983 --> 32:25.234
I don't have a phone.

32:26.110 --> 32:27.987
Really trying to Marie Kondo my life.

32:27.987 --> 32:29.489
A 20-year-old without a phone.

32:29.489 --> 32:33.576
Triangulate the number. Bet you a slice
that's where we find Daddy Dearest.

32:42.210 --> 32:44.087
[phone ringing]

32:45.630 --> 32:48.007
- Hey, honey. We're okay.
- No, you're not, Dad.

32:48.007 --> 32:50.301
Jared and Drea were here
with some scary guy.

32:50.301 --> 32:53.888
<i>They know you have my phone. I'm so sorry.</i>

32:53.888 --> 32:55.974
We'll be all right. Just sit tight.

33:03.523 --> 33:06.484
- We're not safe here. Okay, truth time.
- Uh...

33:06.484 --> 33:09.153
Come on. We more than proved our mettle.
What happened here today?

33:11.030 --> 33:12.281
I'm part of the safe house.

33:13.282 --> 33:14.534
What safe house?

33:15.243 --> 33:17.620
You're familiar
with the 13 missing passengers.

33:18.538 --> 33:23.251
Myself and a network of 828 sympathizers
help them with food, shelter, medicine.

33:23.251 --> 33:24.669
They're all together?

33:24.669 --> 33:26.212
Nine of them are.

33:26.963 --> 33:28.881
I thought when Anson reached out
I could help him,

33:28.881 --> 33:33.302
bring him to the safe house,
but clearly, I got catfished by that Xer.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.722
Probably thought I'd lead him
to the others

33:35.722 --> 33:37.598
so he could cash in on that bounty.

33:38.099 --> 33:39.767
Sorry, what bounty?

33:39.767 --> 33:41.769
Government just put a price on passengers.

33:43.062 --> 33:45.898
$50,000 per person brought in.
Dead or alive.

33:45.898 --> 33:48.735
If Billy is on to you,
a lot of other people will be too.

33:48.735 --> 33:52.447
You need to get back to the safe house
with the others till you're out of danger.

33:52.447 --> 33:55.366
- I'll drop you at your car.
- It's too dangerous. We'll find our way.

33:55.366 --> 33:56.451
Get going.

33:57.869 --> 33:58.703
Uh...

34:01.998 --> 34:03.624
If you can give this to Bethany...

34:05.418 --> 34:06.627
Tell her I love her.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.130
And thank you.

34:12.675 --> 34:13.718

34:14.427 --> 34:15.595
We gotta run.

[suspenseful music plays]

34:22.518 --> 34:24.520
[both panting]

34:33.988 --> 34:35.406
What the hell is this?

34:36.282 --> 34:38.076
I'm guessing something crashed here.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.789
Couldn't have been too long ago.
The ground's still warm.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.751
I can't think of a lot of things
that'd leave a dent this big

34:46.751 --> 34:48.795
or in this shape other than an airplane.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.463
But what airplane?

34:50.463 --> 34:53.883
And who better
to make a plane disappear than the NSA?

34:55.635 --> 34:57.011
We gotta figure this out.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.263
[sighs] Where to?

35:01.557 --> 35:02.475
Detention center.

35:03.643 --> 35:07.146
Is that a joke? We agreed when we ran away
that there was no going back.

35:07.146 --> 35:10.149
That was before we found
this gigantic footprint.

35:11.025 --> 35:13.194
The plane's back where we came from.
I know it.

35:13.778 --> 35:16.155
We go back,
we're in solitary indefinitely.

35:16.155 --> 35:19.283
If we're truly captains of the Lifeboat,
we have to go back, protect the others.

35:19.283 --> 35:20.535
- They need us.
- You were right.

35:20.535 --> 35:23.037
The best way to protect the passengers
is to be on the outside,

35:23.037 --> 35:24.330
to do what we're doing now.

35:24.330 --> 35:25.540
I wasn't right.

35:27.917 --> 35:31.295
Do you ever ask yourself
why we're the captains of the Lifeboat?

35:31.295 --> 35:33.589
Why God chose you first?

35:34.549 --> 35:36.300
Maybe because there's no better cop.

35:36.300 --> 35:40.304
Maybe because you needed shaking
out of your shame spiral the most.

35:42.014 --> 35:42.932
Why me?

35:44.892 --> 35:48.688
Maybe because I was so... myopic.

35:49.772 --> 35:51.691
Didn't care about anything but saving Cal,

35:51.691 --> 35:56.320
just like I spent two years not caring
about anything but finding Eden.

35:57.905 --> 36:00.616
Guess it's no accident
that half the Callings led us too.

36:01.117 --> 36:02.451
It's all connected.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.706
Mick, you've sacrificed so much.

36:06.706 --> 36:10.042
I don't blame you in the slightest
for wanting to be free.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.462
But I can't abandon the passengers,
not again.

36:14.463 --> 36:17.258
I know more about the Callings
and the passengers than anyone,

36:17.258 --> 36:20.595
and if there's any 828er that needs to be
back in that detention center,

36:20.595 --> 36:24.682
acting as a strategist
to surviving the Death Date...

36:28.269 --> 36:29.353

You're right.

and turn myself in.

can I have your pillow?

and return it to her, please.

how we all survive the Death Date.

And the only way to guarantee
that we have any future at all...

is if I leave for now.

at solving Callings than we are.
