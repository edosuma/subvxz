WEBVTT

00:07.424 --> 00:09.050
[David Chang] You look beautiful, Pete.

00:09.134 --> 00:10.885
[Peter Meehan] I think this is
the most romantic lighting

00:10.969 --> 00:12.387
we've ever been in together.

00:12.470 --> 00:13.930
[Chang] Who's coming tonight?

00:14.014 --> 00:15.557
-Gold.
-Who else?

00:16.265 --> 00:18.059
-Gustavo.
-Have you met Gustavo?

00:18.143 --> 00:21.229
-I've never met Gustavo.
-Gustavo is awesome.

00:21.312 --> 00:24.691
I've read his column a lot.
I eat a lot of tacos with Gold.

00:24.774 --> 00:27.402
I think we're gonna go to, like,
three of his favorite places tonight.

00:27.485 --> 00:28.319
Okay.

00:28.403 --> 00:31.573
Is it true that you like quesadillas
more than tacos?

00:31.656 --> 00:33.533
[sighs] I've had a lot of good tacos.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.493
I just don't love tacos
as much as everyone else.

00:35.577 --> 00:39.414
I would rather eat
a more delicious Peking duck

00:39.956 --> 00:40.915
than a taco.

00:41.499 --> 00:45.628
-Why is it, uh, one or the other?
-'Cause the world is binary.

00:45.712 --> 00:46.963
[chuckles]

00:47.964 --> 00:50.383
-Your world is binary?
-Yeah, my world is binary.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.469

01:31.758 --> 01:33.593
-[Chang] I love tacos.
-[Meehan] Yeah.

01:33.676 --> 01:36.137
[Chang] But I would rather
have a burrito or a torta.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.556
[Jonathan Gold] You're from New York.
Of course you don't like tacos.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.766
You haven't had good tacos.

01:39.849 --> 01:44.437
The taco there is just more deliciousness
per square inch.

01:44.521 --> 01:48.441
More deliciousness per second than
there is almost anything in the world.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.110
-[Meehan] Totally agree.
-Wow.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.444
Pound for pound.

01:51.528 --> 01:55.031
[Chang] When you have a row of places
with street vendors here making food,

01:55.115 --> 01:59.244
what are some tell-tale signs
where you'd obviously wanna go to try?

01:59.327 --> 02:05.041
Go to the places where you do not
understand some of the words on the menu.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.293
If you don't know that word,
that's where you wanna go.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.711
'Cause that's gonna tell you immediately
this is regional stuff.

02:09.795 --> 02:14.175
I would also say the salsas. You know,
if you just have red or green... Meh.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.385
[Gold] Or the chiles toreados.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.928
-[Arellano] Oh, yeah.
-[Chang] What's that?

02:17.011 --> 02:19.931
[Gold] Uh, chilies that are basically
blackened on a grill,

02:20.014 --> 02:22.267
good places will, like,
just give 'em away.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.310
-Secrets of the trade. Yeah.
-Secrets of the trade.

02:24.394 --> 02:28.731
And I would say, if you go there
and there's a big mound of masa,

02:28.815 --> 02:31.067
and somebody is making tortillas, score.

02:32.944 --> 02:37.740
Probably, still... What would you say?
80% of the trucks just use...

02:37.824 --> 02:40.368
-Just use junk tortillas.
-[Arellano] Oh, yeah. Way too many.

02:40.451 --> 02:42.162
Horrible tortillas.

02:42.245 --> 02:46.124
So these are the three things.
One is, don't understand the language...

02:46.207 --> 02:47.041
[Meehan] Good sign.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.001
-Good sign.
-Yep.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.670
-Two... Salsa game strong.
-Salsa game strong.

02:50.753 --> 02:52.505
Three, tortilla game strong.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.756
-Someone is making it, right?
-Yeah.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.342
[Arellano] If you see a packet
of tortillas

02:56.426 --> 02:58.303
right next to your taquero, run.

02:59.596 --> 03:03.099
I mean, you wanna talk about regional
cuisine, this is as regional as you get.

03:03.182 --> 03:08.605
You're gonna get a shrimp taco
from one town in Jalisco

03:08.688 --> 03:10.398
and it's gonna be absolutely amazing.

03:10.481 --> 03:13.985
You're getting the tacos de camarón.
That is what we need to get.

03:14.068 --> 03:16.571
-[Meehan] Yeah, that's the order.
-[Arellano] That's the king.

03:16.654 --> 03:19.908
I think everyone's gonna get
their own order. I wanna get camarón.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.118
-Tacos de camarón.
-Tacos de camarón.

03:23.119 --> 03:24.787
-Yes.
-[Arellano] There's your name twice.

03:25.997 --> 03:28.041
-[Gold] You know it's good.
-[all laugh]

03:36.716 --> 03:38.801
-[woman] Your order's ready.
-[man] Order's ready.

03:40.261 --> 03:41.262
Thank you.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.935
[Arellano] It's a hard-shell taco.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.561
[Meehan] But in a completely different way

03:48.645 --> 03:51.105
than the "Taco Night in America"
type of taco.

03:51.189 --> 03:52.482
[Arellano] Yeah.

03:52.565 --> 03:56.486
The most celebrated
"fish taco" in Southern California.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.905
[Chang] It's like har gao.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.699
[Meehan laughs]

04:01.783 --> 04:04.535
There's no food you can't find
an Asian parallel for.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.246
[Gold chuckles]

04:06.329 --> 04:08.623
[Arellano] That's exactly what it is like.

04:08.706 --> 04:11.334
Fried, a little bit of salsa
with that aguacate.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.586
That is tremendous.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.838
You approve of it.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.341
Yeah, it's delicious. I want to order
another one right away. [laughs]

04:18.423 --> 04:20.677
That to me, again, I don't think taco.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.512
-How can you not think taco?
-[Arellano] You don't think taco

04:22.595 --> 04:23.846
'cause you've never had a taco like it.

04:23.930 --> 04:28.518
Well, in my head,
I'm definitely thinking Cantonese dim sum.

04:28.601 --> 04:31.646
You're gonna imagine that there was
a magical history of Chinese...

04:31.729 --> 04:34.357
There has been a long migration
of Chinese to Mexico.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.027
There was Chinese in Mexico just, like,
20 years after the conquest.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.114
-It's already 1530.
-I'm just saying it tastes Chinese to me.

04:41.906 --> 04:43.408
All right, shall we eat on?

04:43.491 --> 04:44.867
-[Chang] Yes.
-[Arellano] Let's do it.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.661
[Chang] That was really fucking awesome.

04:46.744 --> 04:49.038
This is sort of like discovering I'm...

04:49.122 --> 04:51.916
Asian food's not all, you know,
General Tso's chicken.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.419
[Arellano] Well, you're not Mexican. Yeah.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.682
[Rosio Sanchez] "Hija de Sanchez"
means "Daughter of Sanchez."

05:07.765 --> 05:09.392
I'm the daughter of Sanchez.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.103
My parents are Mexican.

05:12.186 --> 05:16.149
They were immigrants to the States,
to try to give me a better life.

05:16.232 --> 05:20.737
And then, here I am in another country
and, in a way, an immigrant myself.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.698
And somewhere along those years,

05:23.781 --> 05:26.617
I realized I just wanted
to get back into my roots

05:26.701 --> 05:30.413
and reflect the flavors
that I really believe in.

05:31.581 --> 05:35.293
I really wanna bring up
what people think of Mexican food,

05:35.376 --> 05:38.588
or, in general, Mexicans in Europe.

05:39.589 --> 05:42.175
If I'm not gonna do it, who's gonna do it?
You know?

05:42.258 --> 05:45.511
Who's going to show people
how great Mexican food can be,

05:45.595 --> 05:48.389
even as simple as a well-made taco?

05:48.473 --> 05:53.352
Which is just simply a well-made tortilla,
even though it's not that simple.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.313
[chuckles] It's, like, hours of work.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.941
[Chang] I've seen you grow
through this process

05:59.025 --> 06:00.485
of, like, trying to find who you are,

06:00.568 --> 06:02.779
'cause that's one thing
that you've always been.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.281
-You are hard as fucking nails.
-[chuckles]

06:05.364 --> 06:08.785
So, do you feel like you can become
the best taco-maker in the world?

06:08.868 --> 06:12.872
Yeah, I want to be.
And I think, you can't say that.

06:12.955 --> 06:15.166
You can't say, "I'm gonna be
the best taco-maker in the world."

06:15.249 --> 06:17.543
-But you definitely think...
-But I definitely want to make--

06:17.627 --> 06:19.295
-Don't play the humble card.
-[laughs]

06:19.378 --> 06:21.547
That's not your strength. [laughs]

06:21.631 --> 06:23.466
I know deep down inside, you're like,
"Fuck everyone else."

06:23.549 --> 06:24.467
I'm gonna fucking kill them!

06:24.550 --> 06:26.803
"I'm gonna be the best
motherfucking taco-maker in the world.

06:26.886 --> 06:31.099
I'm in Copenhagen, so no one thinks I can
fuckin' make the best taco in the world,

06:31.182 --> 06:33.434
and I'm gonna show everyone that I can."

06:33.518 --> 06:34.977
[machine whirring]

06:35.061 --> 06:37.146
We go like this, press it through.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.774
[Chang] When did you go back to Mexico
the first time?

06:39.857 --> 06:41.943
Well, I went to Mexico
when I was younger,

06:42.026 --> 06:45.029
but then I didn't go again
until I started working at Noma.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.865
[Chang] Did you start to go back
when René started to go back?

06:47.949 --> 06:48.783
[Sanchez] Yes.

06:49.992 --> 06:53.287
[Chang] René Redzepi is one
of the world's great chefs

06:53.371 --> 06:57.750
and loves Mexico
and has spent a lot of time in Mexico.

06:58.334 --> 07:02.380
He's done pop-ups in Australia, in Tokyo,
and feels that Mexico might be

07:02.463 --> 07:05.800
the best representation
of what Noma could be.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.971
[Redzepi] Going to Mexico
was a real moment for me.

07:10.054 --> 07:12.098
They have this highly developed cuisine

07:12.181 --> 07:13.975
that blew my mind,
and there was spice in it.

07:14.058 --> 07:15.685
You know, it's hot.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.521
You're touching a food that is, like,
sacred to Mexico.

07:18.604 --> 07:22.442
We're not gonna be traditional Mexican.
We're inspired by what they do.

07:23.025 --> 07:26.821
[Chang] Is there one dish
that you think you can explain

07:26.904 --> 07:28.614
how it sort of bridges the gap?

07:28.698 --> 07:31.868
[Redzepi] We actually took the masa
and we made a ferment of it.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.786
And it's so good.

07:33.870 --> 07:37.999
And to me,
that's a perfect mix of a Noma thing

07:38.082 --> 07:42.587
with this quintessential,
most important factor of Mexican food,

07:42.670 --> 07:45.089
which is the masa, the Mex tortilla.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.258
Are you gonna put a taco
on the menu in Noma Mexico?

07:47.341 --> 07:49.760
If you ask Rosio, she's gonna say yes.

07:49.844 --> 07:52.680
Because we're doing it with Rosio
and she has a taqueria.

07:53.931 --> 07:58.186
Imagine the training she has.
Five years in our kitchens.

07:58.269 --> 08:03.524
She's putting all that knowledge
into her history. It can only be good.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.321
[Chang] Are you gonna feel weird,
cooking in Mexico?

08:08.404 --> 08:10.323
[Sanchez] Weird in what way?

08:10.406 --> 08:11.908
Like you don't belong?

08:12.492 --> 08:14.911
Like, in Korea, they call me a gyopo,

08:14.994 --> 08:19.290
like a foreign-born American,
that I don't belong, right?

08:19.373 --> 08:21.417
Do you feel like they're gonna talk shit?

08:21.501 --> 08:23.628
Mmm. I think they will.
Of course they will.

08:24.545 --> 08:27.715
They have a huge history
beyond what we recognize.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.884
It would be insulting
not to acknowledge that, right?

08:29.967 --> 08:31.928
I think what you guys are presented with

08:32.010 --> 08:37.225
is a very, very difficult task
of doing something respectful but new.

08:37.725 --> 08:40.895
[Sanchez] Well, I hope it'll transition
into Hija as well, to...

08:42.104 --> 08:44.690
harness all the flavors a bit better here.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.527
That's tremendous.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.071
Is this, like, the signature here?

08:50.154 --> 08:51.239
-[Sanchez] No.
-[Chang] What?

08:51.322 --> 08:53.407
-There are better fucking tacos than this?
-[laughs]

08:53.491 --> 08:55.993
I think most people
like the carnitas the best.

08:56.077 --> 08:59.372
-[Chang] I have room for one more.
-[Sanchez] This is not very traditional.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.083
-Fish skin taco.
-[Sanchez] Fish skin taco.

09:02.667 --> 09:06.629
So, this one is also made with salsa,
with gooseberries,

09:06.712 --> 09:07.630
since we were talking about it.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.423
-[Chang] Oh, this is the gooseberry one?
-Yeah.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.092
[Chang] Danes love
the fish skin taco, right?

09:11.175 --> 09:12.593
[Sanchez] Yeah.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.345
-Why?
-So predictable.

09:14.428 --> 09:15.680
-[Sanchez] Why do you say that?
-[chuckles]

09:15.763 --> 09:18.849
[Chang] I wanna know when you're gonna
drop your faux-Danish accent

09:18.933 --> 09:21.477
-and come back to an American one.
-What are you talking about?

09:21.561 --> 09:24.772
[Chang] You'll watch this and be like,
"Wow, I sound like an expat traitor."

09:24.855 --> 09:25.856
[Sanchez] No way.

09:26.357 --> 09:30.361
[Redzepi] Goodbye, Noma. In the trash.

09:30.444 --> 09:31.862
Where are we going?

09:31.946 --> 09:33.864
-Mexico.
-[Redzepi] Oh, come on.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.199
[all] Mexico!

09:35.283 --> 09:36.909
["Mexican Radio" playing]

09:52.550 --> 09:53.759
[narrator] Maize was born

09:53.843 --> 09:56.679
in what we now call Mexico,
9,000 years ago.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.183
Seven thousand years later,
pre-Hispanic communities discovered

10:01.267 --> 10:05.271
that if you cook maize with
an alkaline solution, you create nixtamal.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.440
When you grind it, it becomes masa,

10:07.523 --> 10:10.276
which is what makes corn tortillas
so nutritious.

10:11.485 --> 10:15.740
By the time conquistadores arrived,
the Aztecs were chowing down on tortillas,

10:15.823 --> 10:18.117
which means they were probably
eating tacos, too.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.454
But the Spanish missed their bread.
So after they conquered the Aztecs,

10:21.537 --> 10:24.373
they introduced wheat,
which is how we got flour tortillas.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.752
Flash forward a few hundred years,
after the Mexican-American war,

10:27.835 --> 10:30.254
and taquerias are popping up
all over Mexico City

10:30.338 --> 10:33.215
to feed the workers who flocked there
looking for work.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.270
[Meehan] Understanding that tacos
are a great food to eat

10:46.354 --> 10:49.023
doesn't take anything other
than eating tacos.

10:49.857 --> 10:53.819
And having never been to Mexico before,
it at least gave me a window

10:53.903 --> 10:56.072
into how many different styles
and approaches

10:56.155 --> 11:00.201
to tortillas and fillings
and toppings that existed.

11:07.083 --> 11:11.712
It's ridiculous to restrict tacos to being
a cheap food that you eat quickly,

11:11.796 --> 11:14.090
which they are and they are amazing at,

11:14.173 --> 11:18.469
but why can't that still be a vehicle
for the best cooking in the world,

11:18.552 --> 11:20.262
for the best restaurants in the world?

11:22.973 --> 11:26.018
[Eduardo "Lalo" Garcia]
It happens to a lot of Mexican chefs.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.815
A lot of times we don't see
what we already have in our country

11:30.898 --> 11:33.192
and the richness of our food.

11:33.275 --> 11:36.612
It's extremely unique, you know?

11:36.695 --> 11:38.948
When I first came to Mexico City,

11:39.031 --> 11:42.993
I was very impressed how Mexicans

11:43.077 --> 11:48.332
are so educated when it comes
to really, really amazing food.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.460
So, yeah, there's a big demand.
Huge demand.

11:52.503 --> 11:53.754
I grew up in the States.

11:53.838 --> 11:59.218
I'm just as patriotic about the States

11:59.301 --> 12:02.179
as most Americans.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.640
I lived there for 27 years.

12:04.723 --> 12:08.018
-[Meehan] Were you born there?
-No, I was born in Mexico, in Guanajuato.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.982
I was meant to come back to my country.

12:14.442 --> 12:17.695
I kept finding more and more ingredients,

12:17.778 --> 12:21.657
all these signs that said,
"You belong in Mexico."

12:24.827 --> 12:29.707
You know, the market in Mexico City
is the largest open market in the world.

12:31.375 --> 12:34.086
Central de Abastos
has its own police force,

12:34.170 --> 12:36.881
it has its own transportation system.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.675
So it's the central point for all

12:39.758 --> 12:41.969
-fruits and vegetables.
-For all of Mexico and the world.

12:42.052 --> 12:45.222
If you find something in China
that came from Mexico,

12:45.306 --> 12:46.932
it left Central de Abastos.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.351
-England, the US, wherever.
-It all goes through Abastos.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.480
-It all goes through Central de Abastos.
-Wow.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.441
[Garcia] I love markets in general.

12:55.524 --> 12:58.319
Because it's where you actually start
to think about

12:58.402 --> 13:00.070
what you're going to be cooking.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.530
This is guanabana.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.116
It's one of my favorite fruits.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.577
Not only do I love
what we produce in Mexico,

13:06.660 --> 13:10.289
but I love the markets.
Because it gives you an idea of what...

13:10.372 --> 13:12.875
Here, take some of that. Right there.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.002
It's almost like...

13:16.462 --> 13:17.630
overwhelming.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.423
[speaking Spanish]

13:20.883 --> 13:23.802
[in English]
So, you cooked in the States, right?

13:23.886 --> 13:24.803
[Garcia] Mmm-hmm.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.096
When you came here,

13:26.180 --> 13:29.350
what was the difference
in what there was to cook with?

13:29.433 --> 13:32.269
[Garcia] When I came to Mexico, I was...

13:33.354 --> 13:36.982
kind of shocked
of how much fresh ingredients

13:37.066 --> 13:39.026
we can find all year round.

13:39.109 --> 13:40.778
Because of all
the different climates and...

13:40.861 --> 13:43.239
Because of the climate,
because of the cultures.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.533
It took me a few years
to actually, like...

13:45.616 --> 13:47.618
Acclimate to what was here

13:47.701 --> 13:49.203
-and how to cook with it.
-Yes, yes.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.163
Lima. I wanna buy some of this.

13:51.747 --> 13:52.748
Señor!

14:00.673 --> 14:02.716
[Chang] That first taco
was fucking extraordinary.

14:02.800 --> 14:03.676
[Arellano] Yep.

14:03.759 --> 14:07.012
[Chang] It was one of the best bites
of food I've had in a long time.

14:07.096 --> 14:12.059
All right, so my theory
that it could be Chinese or Asian...

14:12.142 --> 14:14.478
-[Arellano] It is not completely insane.
-[Chang] Thank you.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.730
-[Arellano] Not completely insane.
-[Chang] You're saying there's a chance?

14:16.814 --> 14:18.399
Anyone who comes to Mexico,

14:18.482 --> 14:20.943
they put in their little bits and pieces
of their culture.

14:21.026 --> 14:24.697
The Germans, the Czechs, the Poles,
they gave us the beer.

14:24.780 --> 14:28.993
Uh, Lebanese gave us al pastor with
tacos árabes that we're gonna eat soon.

14:29.076 --> 14:33.038
You go to Mérida,
and you go into the mercado,

14:33.122 --> 14:35.624
where there are giant mounds
of Edam cheese

14:35.708 --> 14:40.796
in the red wax because they always had,
like, a big trade with Holland.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.425
You know, so all these different cultures
are bringing in their cuisines.

14:44.508 --> 14:46.343
That's what makes
Mexican food so delicious

14:46.427 --> 14:48.178
and, again, so long-lasting.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.483
[Chang] Hey, Gustavo, you wanna tell me
what's going on in here?

15:01.567 --> 15:03.861
[Arellano] Yeah, so these are gonna be
people from Puebla,

15:03.944 --> 15:06.196
making what's basically a taco árabes.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.783
Taco árabes, most people
would compare it to shawarma.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.493
They're doing it off the spit.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.996
And what you're gonna see
looks kind of like pita bread,

15:14.079 --> 15:16.290
but it's a completely different bread.
It's called pan árabe.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.292
So it's gonna be
a little bit thinner than a pita,

15:18.375 --> 15:20.502
and that all comes
from the Lebanese migration

15:20.586 --> 15:24.924
that came to Puebla in Central Mexico
from the 1920s onward.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.134
[Chang] I had no idea
of anything about that history.

15:27.217 --> 15:28.469
[Arellano] Mmm-hmm.

15:29.720 --> 15:33.182
I feel like a total fool
and it's awesome. [chuckles]

15:34.558 --> 15:35.976
No idea what's happening.

15:36.727 --> 15:37.978
[Arellano speaking in Spanish]

15:39.063 --> 15:41.023
[in English] Ooh, this is so good.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.232
-[Gold] Oh, look at that.
-[Chang] Oh, my God.

15:42.316 --> 15:45.486
[Meehan] So, what happened to this meat?
Why is it so delicious?

15:46.153 --> 15:47.363
[Arellano] The marinade.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.658
It really feels like a kebab.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.328
That's crazy that there is such a...

15:55.579 --> 15:58.290
a clear line from that food to this food.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.543
Is there anything Chinese about it
that you can find yet?

16:01.627 --> 16:03.379
-[Gold chuckles]
-I hope you choke.

16:04.004 --> 16:07.466
Okay, I had no idea
this is Lebanese in origin.

16:07.549 --> 16:10.052
And the al pastor tradition
came from that?

16:10.135 --> 16:13.055
There's only so much food
you can fucking know.

16:13.138 --> 16:16.225
I know nothing
about certain food cultures

16:16.308 --> 16:19.561
and, unfortunately, all of Mexico
is one of them.

16:19.645 --> 16:23.649
That very much goes to the stereotypes
Americans have always had about Mexico.

16:23.732 --> 16:26.694
That Mexicans can only be
of Indian descent and Spanish descent,

16:26.777 --> 16:28.737
and that you don't have
all these different traditions

16:28.821 --> 16:31.031
coming in and making Mexican food
what it is.

17:13.156 --> 17:15.992
This is my mother.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.662
-[Meehan] Your mother?
-My mother. My father.

17:20.122 --> 17:23.125
[in Spanish] Countrymen, cousins.

17:23.208 --> 17:27.378
[Andres] I think that story began
when my grandparents came here to Puebla.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.257
They came in 1928.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.926
Due to the First World War,
they became refugees.

17:33.010 --> 17:36.138
Turkey, with their German leaders,

17:36.221 --> 17:42.519
killed three million Assyrian-Chaldeans
and Armenians.

17:42.603 --> 17:45.564
They were eradicated
from their own country,

17:45.647 --> 17:47.900
and they went out to emigrate.

17:47.983 --> 17:51.653
[in English] How did the family come
to start making tacos here in Puebla?

17:51.737 --> 17:57.618
[Don in Spanish] So the Greeks came
and they placed a meat spinning top.

17:57.701 --> 18:01.371
[Andres] Traditionally, originally,
it was made with lamb.

18:01.455 --> 18:04.917
But in accordance with Mexican tradition,
we started to use pork.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.378
It's something similar to the shawarma,

18:08.462 --> 18:10.089
but it was adjusted
to the Mexican culture.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.051
[Javier Helu] When my father
came to Puebla,

18:14.134 --> 18:17.012
he began to make "Arab bread".

18:17.096 --> 18:19.890
[Don] The name "Arab taco"
came from the tortilla.

18:19.973 --> 18:21.642
The tortilla is Arabic.

18:22.226 --> 18:28.398
One day, a cousin of his passed by
and he told him, "You know what?

18:28.982 --> 18:31.193
Here, grab these pieces of bread.

18:31.276 --> 18:34.071
Put some meat in them,
and go sell them."

18:34.154 --> 18:36.365
In that moment, some lady approaches
and told them,

18:36.448 --> 18:39.535
"Please, give me two Arab tacos."

18:40.160 --> 18:43.789
Yes, since then the two families
came together,

18:43.872 --> 18:46.750
the bread family and the taco family.

18:46.834 --> 18:50.963
And they create the perfect marriage
to create a new type of food.

18:52.381 --> 18:55.217
[Meehan in English] Are there immigrants
coming to Mexico now, coming to Puebla,

18:55.300 --> 18:58.387
making new food,
adding to the food culture of the city?

18:58.470 --> 19:00.264
Is that still happening?

19:00.347 --> 19:01.849
[Helu in Spanish] Yes, now here in Puebla,

19:01.932 --> 19:04.184
you can see dishes
from all over the world.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.270
There is a lot of diversity.

19:06.353 --> 19:10.190
A lot of immigrants bring their food
and end up having successful businesses.

19:11.608 --> 19:13.485
[Meehan in English]
So, how long will that trompo last?

19:13.569 --> 19:15.404
Will you be done with that by tonight?

19:15.487 --> 19:21.577
[in Spanish] Yes, this spinning top should
be gone around 6:00 or 7:00 p.m.

19:26.957 --> 19:30.043
-[Andres] Do you like it?
-I love it. It's fantastic.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.590
And so much like a taco, but different.
It's its own thing.

19:39.511 --> 19:42.639
[Meehan] I mean, isn't the taco kind of
the most amazing canvas

19:42.723 --> 19:45.350
for fusion of cuisines and cultures?

19:45.434 --> 19:46.852
Even within Mexico?

19:46.935 --> 19:52.065
I mean, Peking duck is one thing.
Tacos is a universe that keeps expanding.

19:52.149 --> 19:57.446
The fact that almost every culture
has some type of food that is wrapped,

19:58.030 --> 20:01.742
I don't think that is any ethnicity
or any culture. It's just--

20:01.825 --> 20:03.076
What is the Ur-wrap?

20:03.160 --> 20:06.872
What is the king of all kings
when it comes to the wraps?

20:06.955 --> 20:10.209
-Is it the ssam? Is it taco?
-I have no historical data,

20:10.292 --> 20:12.836
but I will venture to say it's Korean.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.005
[all chuckle]

20:15.088 --> 20:16.757
[Arellano] You guys are the
Mexicans of Asia, man.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.300
-[Chang] Yes.
-[all laughing]

20:30.229 --> 20:33.565
[Choi] This is the first truck, uh,
number 69, that started Kogi.

20:33.649 --> 20:36.985
This is the one that I was driving
when we only had four people on the team.

20:39.529 --> 20:40.989
This is the windshield we looked through

20:41.073 --> 20:43.867
before we even knew
what the hell we were going through.

20:46.620 --> 20:50.082
When we started Kogi,
the economy had just crashed in LA.

20:50.165 --> 20:54.628
And so our idea was to provide this
experience which was normally expensive.

20:54.711 --> 20:59.007
Like, 50 bucks a portion Korean barbecue,
into street taco at $2.

21:01.218 --> 21:05.722
So when you eat it,
it doesn't taste Korean or Mexican, right?

21:05.806 --> 21:08.267
-It just tastes like Kogi.
-It just tastes good.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.186
Yeah. I think that's the thing
that made Kogi so special.

21:12.312 --> 21:15.941
[Chang] I remember when you were, like,
the first chef to use Twitter.

21:16.024 --> 21:20.862
And it wasn't that long ago,
but it seems like ages ago.

21:22.155 --> 21:25.284
As significant as that was,
in terms of you using technology

21:25.367 --> 21:27.369
-and using food trucks...
-[Choi] Uh-huh.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.746
[Chang] ...to me, you were creating
new American food

21:29.830 --> 21:32.499
and doing it in a style
that represented Los Angeles.

21:32.582 --> 21:35.002
We're still treated as outsiders,
in a way.

21:35.085 --> 21:39.131
I kind of love that shit, man.
I love that, because this is who we are.

21:39.214 --> 21:42.884
We're still immigrants, we're still
out here on the street, cooking.

21:42.968 --> 21:47.639
They are a part of Kogi's flavor now
more than I am, you know?

21:47.723 --> 21:51.393
Maria Lena's been cooking on this truck
for almost eight and a half years.

21:52.185 --> 21:53.520
And they use our recipes,

21:53.603 --> 21:58.066
but they've put twists on it
that have evolved Kogi without me.

21:58.150 --> 22:01.194
How is this expression of freedom
and finding your voice

22:01.278 --> 22:05.282
and representing the voice
of immigrants, community, street culture?

22:05.365 --> 22:09.870
-[Choi] Yeah.
-Why is that best represented in a taco?

22:09.953 --> 22:11.204
Nobody hates tacos.

22:14.249 --> 22:17.294
It's this portable kind of like
vessel of love, in a way.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.547
So when we're handing
this taco out to people

22:20.630 --> 22:22.341
in the middle of the night...

22:23.300 --> 22:26.011
all those things
that led up to that moment,

22:26.094 --> 22:30.474
whether you called us a chink
or a wetback or beaner,

22:30.557 --> 22:35.395
all these things that separated us,
all of a sudden, washed away.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.774
The Mexicans and Latinos

22:38.857 --> 22:41.651
in East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights,
South LA,

22:41.735 --> 22:45.322
all gave us respect, because they just
said this shit is the bomb.

22:45.405 --> 22:49.034
The Koreans, they all just wanted
to copy our business model. [chuckles]

22:49.117 --> 22:50.077
There were a lot.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.454
There were a lot,
but they loved the food.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.582
And everyone writing about it
could never pigeonhole it.

22:55.665 --> 22:57.542
It just became Los Angeles.

22:57.626 --> 23:00.837
[Chang] If you understand Korean food,
if you understand tacos,

23:00.921 --> 23:03.090
-there are a lot of similarities.
-[Choi] Yeah.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.759
[Chang] I don't think Kogi
could've existed anywhere else

23:05.842 --> 23:08.136
except for here in a taco truck.

23:08.220 --> 23:13.725
[Choi] It's because of the deep Chicano,
Mexican culture here in Los Angeles

23:13.809 --> 23:17.145
that goes back all the way,
you know, almost 100 years.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.439
The cruising culture.

23:19.523 --> 23:20.857
The graffiti culture.

23:21.608 --> 23:24.569
The tattooing culture.
The gang culture.

23:24.653 --> 23:25.862
The Korean culture here.

23:25.946 --> 23:28.782
I think it's like,
you can't recreate that experience,

23:28.865 --> 23:30.742
just like I couldn't recreate

23:30.826 --> 23:32.744
the Italian-American,
New Jersey experience.

23:32.828 --> 23:33.954
-Right.
-You know what I mean?

23:34.037 --> 23:37.791
That had to happen over there
and this had to happen over here.

23:59.396 --> 24:01.690
[Redzepi] This is our test kitchen here.

24:01.773 --> 24:03.316
-This is where--
-The Caribbean is here,

24:03.400 --> 24:04.734
the test kitchen here.

24:04.818 --> 24:08.363
And in the back of all of this,
that's where the jungle starts

24:08.446 --> 24:10.907
and that's where our restaurant will be.

24:11.533 --> 24:15.537
This is just all the beginning of actually
some sort of creative work to start.

24:15.620 --> 24:18.081
[Meehan] What's different
cooking Mexican food in Mexico?

24:19.166 --> 24:20.458
[chuckles] All the products.

24:21.209 --> 24:23.879
Everything tastes better,
everything tastes fresher.

24:23.962 --> 24:27.883
[Redzepi] This is the seed of the mamey.
A very, very common fruit here.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.427
[Meehan] I've never had a star fruit
that tasted of anything.

24:30.510 --> 24:32.304
Are they good?
Have you tasted them down here?

24:32.387 --> 24:34.681
And just like that? Take a bite.

24:36.850 --> 24:39.060
-You'll be shocked.
-Wow.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.146
[Sanchez] Cooking here,
it's a completely different ball game.

24:41.229 --> 24:43.523
You get all the ingredients
I've never seen before.

24:44.524 --> 24:45.901
[Redzepi] This is called annona.

24:48.236 --> 24:49.279
[Meehan] It's like pudding.

24:49.362 --> 24:52.240
-It's vanilla-y and custardy and almondy.
-[Redzepi] Yeah.

24:52.324 --> 24:57.037
At home we also have red things.
They're just beets. [chuckles]

24:57.120 --> 24:59.372
[Sanchez] It's a difficult,
difficult task.

24:59.456 --> 25:01.666
[Meehan] But like, in Copenhagen,
you're, like, Mexican?

25:01.750 --> 25:02.792
In... Yes.

25:02.876 --> 25:06.379
But in Mexico, you are "American."

25:06.463 --> 25:08.089
It's the story of my life. [chuckles]

25:08.173 --> 25:11.885
I feel like I grew up Mexican.
As Mexican as I could.

25:11.968 --> 25:15.555
I'm trying to cook something
that I think is close to me.

25:16.598 --> 25:21.061
[Redzepi] We want, actually, to challenge
ourselves. To do something different.

25:21.144 --> 25:23.230
You've never tasted a texture like this.

25:23.313 --> 25:26.566
-It's sprouting coconut. Isn't it weird?
-[Meehan] Wow. Yeah.

25:26.650 --> 25:29.486
Right now,
we're trying not to think too much.

25:29.569 --> 25:32.822
-Right.
-Just open up, taste, store the memory.

25:34.532 --> 25:35.700
Wow.

25:41.414 --> 25:43.583
It looks like cheese, right? [chuckles]

25:44.251 --> 25:46.586
[both speaking Spanish]

25:46.670 --> 25:47.963
[in English] He says when you peel them,

25:48.046 --> 25:50.548
you should soak them
in salt water for a minute.

25:50.632 --> 25:56.304
Then their acidity and the astringency,
that sometimes burns you a bit, goes away.

25:56.888 --> 25:57.722
Yeah.

25:57.806 --> 25:58.807
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.354
The salt water is amazing for it.

26:07.148 --> 26:08.984
[Sanchez] A few years into Noma,
I told my dad,

26:09.067 --> 26:10.652
"I'm gonna go to Mexico
and work in Mexico."

26:10.735 --> 26:11.569
[Meehan] Right.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.655
He's like, "I don't support that at all."

26:13.738 --> 26:16.533
And this is coming
from an immigrant father.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.076
His idea is that,

26:18.159 --> 26:20.036
"I came to the States
so you can have a better life.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.538
You don't have to go back."

26:21.621 --> 26:23.164
Things like that. But my point is,

26:23.248 --> 26:25.000
I wanna learn about the culture,
I wanna cook.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.669
I can figure out some other way.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.847
[Meehan] So, you gonna go
to Noma in Tulum?

26:38.930 --> 26:41.308
I've heard nothing but good things
about that guy,

26:41.391 --> 26:44.144
but we can just come here.
This is my Noma for tonight.

26:44.227 --> 26:45.895
It's different.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.063
[stutters] It is a different style.

26:47.147 --> 26:51.067
It's a different concept, for sure,
but is it appropriation?

26:51.151 --> 26:53.069
Should Mexican food be that expensive?

26:53.153 --> 26:55.697
And if it is, is it still Mexican food?

26:55.780 --> 26:58.825
What fine dining does,
or at least you hope it does...

26:58.908 --> 27:02.996
There's a synthesis that takes place.
You're not reproducing this.

27:03.079 --> 27:04.414
[Arellano] Redzepi obviously cares.

27:04.497 --> 27:07.667
In that sense, it's awesome
that you do have that acknowledgment

27:07.751 --> 27:10.628
from some of the best chefs in the world
that Mexican cuisine is it.

27:10.712 --> 27:11.588
At the same time,

27:11.671 --> 27:14.341
I don't know if putting it
into the echelon of high dining

27:14.424 --> 27:16.634
necessarily does anything to the cuisine.

27:16.718 --> 27:18.345
[conch blowing]

27:25.018 --> 27:26.978
[whining and barking]

27:34.819 --> 27:38.073
[Meehan] What are you guys doing,
coming out to Yaxunah?

27:38.156 --> 27:43.119
Something like this is very important
to kind of the development process.

27:43.203 --> 27:47.540
Being aware of what's a tradition
in a place like Yaxunah,

27:47.624 --> 27:49.876
in a place like Mexico, um,

27:49.959 --> 27:51.920
where they already eat
very delicious all the time.

27:53.838 --> 27:56.049
[in Spanish] Hello, how are you?

27:56.132 --> 27:57.342
Excuse me.

27:58.051 --> 28:00.178
-Everything is grown by you?
-Yes.

28:00.261 --> 28:02.305
-And everything it's fresh.
-Everything it's fresh.

28:02.389 --> 28:06.017
[Sanchez in English] Everything around
here is what goes in to the cochinita.

28:06.101 --> 28:09.604
[Meehan] Which I feel, to some degree,
is the reason Noma became so good.

28:09.687 --> 28:11.815
Is 'cause René was trying to
make food of that place

28:11.898 --> 28:15.193
and like, get into all the weird,
green, bitter herbs along the beach

28:15.276 --> 28:17.028
and figure out
how to make them delicious.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.822
-[Sanchez in Spanish] Can I grab one?
-[woman] Sure, go ahead.

28:18.905 --> 28:23.868
So when you are going to cook,
you take it from here?

28:23.952 --> 28:24.994
[woman] Yes.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.206
-[Meehan in English] And so that's...
-[Sanchez] So, these are the seeds.

28:28.289 --> 28:31.084
[Meehan] And that's the seed
that gives the red color?

28:31.167 --> 28:32.377
[in Spanish]
It just gives it color, right?

28:32.460 --> 28:33.336
Yes.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.004
[Sanchez in English]
And they also use it for makeup.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.548
How nice. So...

28:36.631 --> 28:37.465
[Sanchez in Spanish] And the lips?

28:37.549 --> 28:39.426
-[in English] Is it a little rouge?
-[laughing]

28:39.509 --> 28:41.136
[woman in Spanish]
Now you have some color.

28:41.219 --> 28:43.722
-[in English] There we go. Look better?
-[laughing]

28:43.805 --> 28:47.350
-Now it looks like you are healthy.
-Yeah. Giving a little color to my cheeks.

28:48.226 --> 28:50.061
[Sanchez] They're gonna grind it by hand.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.772
-There's a magic about that.
-[Meehan] Right. That it's all just--

28:52.856 --> 28:54.357
[Sanchez] Everything's here,
everything's grown

28:54.441 --> 28:56.276
and harvested whenever they need it.

28:58.027 --> 28:59.404
[in Spanish] So you can rest a little.

28:59.487 --> 29:01.448
-[in English] You can do it too.
-I can grind?

29:01.531 --> 29:05.827
[Sanchez] So we're making the paste here,
that's the annatto seed.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.246
A little bit of water, garlic, onion...

29:09.873 --> 29:11.374
-[in Spanish] He really wants to eat.
-[laughter]

29:11.458 --> 29:12.667
Then he better work.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.836
[in English] How normal is it for men
to be involved in this--

29:14.919 --> 29:16.880
I said, "You wanna eat,
you better work for it."

29:16.963 --> 29:17.922
[all laughing]

29:19.132 --> 29:21.718
-You're very good at this.
-[Meehan] I don't know if that's true.

29:21.801 --> 29:23.219
[Sanchez laughs]

29:26.222 --> 29:31.978
[Sanchez] It was an extreme privilege
to be able to taste, talk about ideas

29:32.061 --> 29:33.938
and how we're gonna cook.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.648
It's like a cook's dream.

29:42.322 --> 29:47.952
I do think people don't realize how much
time goes into a lot of Mexican food.

29:48.036 --> 29:50.413
And especially, like, tacos and moles.

29:50.497 --> 29:53.166
You know, people will eat it and just go,
"Oh, okay."

29:53.917 --> 29:57.796
So it's a huge effort,
and I think, um, sometimes it gets lost.

30:14.521 --> 30:15.688
[bell tolls]

30:21.277 --> 30:25.532
I think the hard-shell taco is one
of the most unfairly maligned foods

30:25.615 --> 30:28.493
in the United States,
but specifically in Mexican cuisine.

30:28.576 --> 30:31.996
Everyone loves to talk crap,
"Oh, hard shell's not authentic.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.500
It's for gabachos, for white people.
For dumb white people for enjoying that."

30:35.583 --> 30:37.085
-What's that term?
-Gabacho.

30:37.168 --> 30:40.296
-Gabacho. I gotta use that.
-Gabacho. Oh, yeah.

30:40.380 --> 30:43.842
Gringo doesn't work.
Nobody calls anybody gringos anymore.

30:43.925 --> 30:46.261
-Only gringos call gringos "gringos."
-Yeah.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.974
-[Meehan] So, where are we going?
-[Arellano] We're going to Taco Bell.

30:51.057 --> 30:52.642
-[Chang] You serious?
-[Arellano and Gold] Yeah.

30:52.725 --> 30:56.771
[Gold] It's garbage food
that they serve at Taco Bell.

30:56.855 --> 31:00.024
It's too bad we're not going to
a combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.

31:00.108 --> 31:01.150
[laughing]

31:01.234 --> 31:03.027
[Arellano]
Oh, we're going to KFC-Taco Bell.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.029
-[Meehan] Oh, there you go.
-[Gold] Oh, what a nightmare.

31:05.113 --> 31:07.448
[woman] Hi, welcome to KFC and Taco Bell.
How can I help you?

31:07.532 --> 31:08.741
[Gold] Let's just leave.

31:10.326 --> 31:11.578
[Chang groans]

31:12.412 --> 31:14.038
There's so many fucking choices.

31:14.122 --> 31:16.708
I feel like I've entered
Dungeons &amp; Dragons

31:16.791 --> 31:18.418
and I'm on level two.

31:19.168 --> 31:21.504
-[Arellano] Who are you? Are you the elf?
-[Chang] Yeah.

31:21.588 --> 31:26.301
Uh, two Dorito Locos Tacos, please.
We'll get one Crunchwrap Supreme as well.

31:26.384 --> 31:27.510
Wow, the menu's changed.

31:27.594 --> 31:29.178
[woman] Total is $7.42 at the window.
Thank you.

31:29.262 --> 31:31.514
-Thank you.
-The menu has changed.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.558
What do you eat here?
KFC or Taco Bell?

31:33.641 --> 31:36.060
-[woman] Neither. I don't like them.
-[all laugh]

31:39.939 --> 31:41.107
Mmm-mmm.

31:42.108 --> 31:43.776
[Arellano] What I don't like about
the Doritos Locos Taco,

31:43.860 --> 31:45.069
it needs more Doritos flavor.

31:45.153 --> 31:47.906
And what kills it is the "beef"
that they use in it.

31:47.989 --> 31:49.616
That throws off everything.

31:49.699 --> 31:51.576
You know what would be better?
If it was a bag of Doritos.

31:51.659 --> 31:52.493
Yes!

31:52.577 --> 31:55.580
[Chang] I feel like,
by bringing, uh, Taco Bell in here,

31:55.663 --> 31:59.083
it's like having three Lester Bangs
talk about Led Zeppelin.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.501
[all laughing]

32:05.590 --> 32:08.051
[Arellano] So we're in San Bernardino,
California.

32:08.134 --> 32:12.513
Old Route 66. This is, like, the cradle
of Mexican food in the United States.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.390
Across the street, Mitla Cafe,

32:14.474 --> 32:17.644
one of the oldest Mexican restaurants
left in the United States. 80 years old.

32:17.727 --> 32:19.145
First started in 1937.

32:19.228 --> 32:23.942
Great tacos, birrias, chile relleno soup.
Oh, my God.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.361
-All right. Thank you.
-[waitress] You're welcome.

32:26.444 --> 32:27.612
[Arellano] But then,
right across the street,

32:27.695 --> 32:31.824
that was the original taco spot
for Glen Bell of Taco Bell fame.

32:31.908 --> 32:34.494
There's no plaque there.
I just know it 'cause, I don't know,

32:34.577 --> 32:36.245
I wrote the book on Mexican food.

32:36.329 --> 32:39.916
This is where Glen Bell got the idea
to mass produce tacos.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.793
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

32:41.876 --> 32:44.504
He wanted to make hamburgers,
but just up Mount Vernon,

32:44.587 --> 32:45.588
towards Baseline,

32:45.672 --> 32:48.633
that's where the original
McDonald's hamburger stand was.

32:48.716 --> 32:51.928
So he figures, "Okay, the way
I'm gonna get rich is by making tacos."

32:52.720 --> 32:56.265
He didn't know how to make tacos.
He's a white guy from San Bernardino.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.393
Every night after he'd close up shop,

32:58.476 --> 33:00.645
he'd go right across the street
to Mitla Cafe,

33:00.728 --> 33:04.732
order some and try to figure out,
"How can I deconstruct those tacos?"

33:04.816 --> 33:07.235
But this is actually where
the taco lost its soul.

33:14.117 --> 33:18.287
The tacos are amazing.
They're just old-school, hard-shelled.

33:18.371 --> 33:20.957
Then you got the blizzard
of the cheddar cheese,

33:21.040 --> 33:24.002
the repollo, the tomato,
and then the meat inside.

33:24.085 --> 33:26.963
But then, when you describe it
to, like, a "real Mexican,"

33:27.046 --> 33:28.506
they're like,
"That's not real Mexican food."

33:28.589 --> 33:30.675
-Right.
-"That's fake Mexican food."

33:30.758 --> 33:33.261
How do you respond to people
when they say that?

33:33.344 --> 33:36.764
So my grandmother came here
from Tepatitlán, Jalisco,

33:36.848 --> 33:37.807
and that was her recipe.

33:37.890 --> 33:39.976
That's what she was making
when she was in Mexico

33:40.059 --> 33:42.311
and that's what she was making
when she came to the United States.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.063
The ingredients changed a little bit.

33:44.147 --> 33:45.982
Those are the things
that were available to her.

33:46.065 --> 33:46.899
-Yeah.
-Ground beef,

33:46.983 --> 33:49.861
cheddar cheese, tomatoes,
lettuce, iceberg lettuce.

33:49.944 --> 33:53.281
So she made it work and she made it great.

33:53.364 --> 33:57.493
What I've always said about Mexican food,
that staying power, it always adapts.

33:57.577 --> 33:58.745
No matter where it is.

33:58.828 --> 34:00.705
[Montaño] When my grandmother
opened the restaurant,

34:00.788 --> 34:04.208
she wanted to have
American-style food on the menu.

34:04.292 --> 34:07.128
-The first item is a T-bone steak.
-[Arellano chuckles]

34:07.211 --> 34:11.591
How do you feel that your family's recipe,
like, your heritage,

34:11.674 --> 34:15.511
was basically taken by Glen Bell and
turned into a multi-billion dollar empire?

34:15.594 --> 34:18.056
We don't talk about it
in terms of what could have been

34:18.139 --> 34:19.766
or what he did to us
or anything like that.

34:19.849 --> 34:23.518
It's more of, "Look at our connection
to the history of food in this country."

34:23.603 --> 34:26.147
When you hear stories like
salsa is the number one condiment,

34:26.230 --> 34:28.274
or tortillas are right there
next to the Wonder Bread.

34:28.357 --> 34:29.275
That's what the country's about.

34:29.358 --> 34:32.445
That's what the immigrant story is about,
is assimilating.

34:32.527 --> 34:34.237
But not only assimilating to the culture,

34:34.322 --> 34:38.534
but having that predominant culture
assimilate some of your beliefs,

34:38.618 --> 34:42.663
some of what you do well, and make it
part of the general population.

34:45.083 --> 34:49.462
[Gold] To me, the problem with Del Taco
and with Taco Bell

34:49.545 --> 34:51.797
is you can eat a taco

34:51.880 --> 34:55.176
and it's completely separated
from the people who cook it

34:55.259 --> 34:56.677
and the culture that produced it.

34:56.761 --> 34:59.847
[Arellano] I view Taco Bell, Del Taco,
they're the gateway drug.

34:59.931 --> 35:04.602
They're the restaurants that Americans
know the idea of Mexican food.

35:04.685 --> 35:07.939
So at this point now, where there's
Mexicans all over the United States,

35:08.022 --> 35:09.273
people are more willing to try it.

35:09.357 --> 35:12.193
I once put away a couple
of white supremacists, in jail,

35:12.276 --> 35:15.279
and I found pictures of them
that they had posted on Stormfront

35:15.363 --> 35:19.325
of them, uh, eating Del Taco burritos,
which, that's awesome to me.

35:19.408 --> 35:21.786
When you have white supremacists
gorging on Mexican food

35:21.869 --> 35:25.832
and thinking that's part of who they are,
that's a small victory unto itself.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.969
[Meehan] This is tortilla making?

35:38.970 --> 35:41.931
[Sanchez chuckles] Yes.
No machines, all hand.

35:43.057 --> 35:45.852
-The corn, it's the basis of their diet.
-[Meehan] Right.

35:45.935 --> 35:47.562
[Sanchez] And you're eating it
for breakfast

35:47.645 --> 35:49.897
and you're eating it for lunch
and you're eating it for dinner.

35:51.065 --> 35:52.191
-How they work...
-[Meehan] Right.

35:52.275 --> 35:53.860
[Sanchez] What they're harvesting,

35:53.943 --> 35:57.738
how they spend their days,
it's everything.

35:57.822 --> 36:00.700
-I'm just gonna fail honorably.
-No. No, no, no.

36:00.783 --> 36:03.661
-No? Go back again?
-She's looking at you weird.

36:03.744 --> 36:04.745
What's this?

36:06.747 --> 36:09.083
-I feel like you're not translating.
-[laughs]

36:09.167 --> 36:13.004
-Can't just leave me out here in the cold.
-I wanna win. People are hungry, Peter.

36:16.549 --> 36:17.884
[Sanchez and Meehan] Ah...

36:20.303 --> 36:22.972
See, that's how you win, is you get
somebody to help you right at the end.

36:25.391 --> 36:27.685
-Mine's fat.
-Mine's ripped.

36:27.768 --> 36:30.271
-Theirs are perfect.
-[Sanchez chuckles]

36:31.522 --> 36:35.526
And so these are the tortillas that're
gonna be at the pop-up that you guys do.

36:35.610 --> 36:40.531
[Sanchez] When we arrived here, we were
extremely inspired after we ate here

36:40.615 --> 36:42.158
and talking to everybody.

36:42.241 --> 36:45.620
So we asked a lot of these women
if they wanted to come and work for us

36:45.703 --> 36:49.415
and kind of be a part of the project
and do what they do best. [chuckles]

37:04.388 --> 37:07.141
[Alex Holley] What do you think of
when you think of South Philly, Mike?

37:07.225 --> 37:09.727
[Mike Jerrick] Uh, I think of
the good people. The sports complexes.

37:09.810 --> 37:11.562
The, uh, cheese steaks
you can get there.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.481
Well, it's not just home to all that,

37:13.564 --> 37:16.943
it's also to one
of the best new restaurants in America.

37:17.026 --> 37:19.612
-According to whom? Oh.
-Bon Appétit. Yeah.

37:21.113 --> 37:22.448
[indistinct chatter]

37:25.368 --> 37:26.744
[indistinct chatter]

37:34.585 --> 37:37.296
-Hey. Good to see you.
-Excited to be here.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.262
[Miller] The story is really Cristina,

37:44.345 --> 37:47.473
because she's been cooking barbacoa
since she's six years old.

37:47.556 --> 37:50.434
She's learned how to do everything,
you know?

37:52.228 --> 37:55.815
Is barbacoa cooked all over Mexico
or is it a specific place?

37:56.565 --> 38:00.778
[in Spanish] We made barbacoa
in Capulhuac. That is a specific location.

38:00.861 --> 38:03.823
It's a traditional family food.

38:03.906 --> 38:07.868
It was my gift to Philadelphia.

38:07.952 --> 38:10.788
I'm not sure how I figured it out,

38:10.871 --> 38:13.582
just that I saw a need
for this kind of food.

38:15.334 --> 38:18.170
[in English] Can I get four tacos?
Two lamb, two pork?

38:18.254 --> 38:20.089
-Sure. Is it for here?
-For here.

38:20.172 --> 38:21.424
Nice.

38:22.758 --> 38:24.093
It's what I grew up with

38:24.176 --> 38:26.804
and Cristina really makes it
a bit like home.

38:26.887 --> 38:31.100
This is how I get most of my experiences
with a lot of immigrants

38:31.183 --> 38:33.686
is by coming to places like this.

38:33.769 --> 38:37.440
[man] The place they've created
has transcended borders.

38:37.523 --> 38:39.900
[Miller] There's no stopping her
from cooking barbacoa.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.068
We had our little apartment,

38:41.152 --> 38:43.904
and she just started selling it to guys,
like on the weekends, Sundays.

38:43.988 --> 38:46.032
She would just, like, tell them,
"Yo, I cook barbacoa."

38:46.115 --> 38:48.451
People just kept coming and coming.

38:48.534 --> 38:52.246
We got so busy in our little apartment
that we had to move into the food car.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.040
That got busy, too.

38:54.123 --> 38:58.419
This place is almost ready
for an expansion, too.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.379
You guys gonna take over
the next building?

39:00.463 --> 39:02.173
-Ah. I don't know what we're gonna do.
-[coughs]

39:02.256 --> 39:04.967
I mean, it's tough because I feel like

39:05.051 --> 39:06.969
we don't really have stability
in this country, you know?

39:07.053 --> 39:08.846
Because of my wife's legal status.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.439
Cristina came here,
walked across the desert,

39:18.522 --> 39:21.025
so she could put her daughter
through nursing school.

39:21.108 --> 39:24.403
And she's here
and her daughter's, you know, a nurse.

39:24.487 --> 39:26.947
And she can't go visit her,
because she wouldn't be able to come back.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.157
Even though we're legally married,

39:28.240 --> 39:30.493
she would have to go
and live in Mexico for ten years

39:30.576 --> 39:32.286
before she could even apply
for a green card.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.788
This is the way that the law is set up.

39:33.871 --> 39:36.999
It traps undocumented people here
with no rights

39:37.083 --> 39:40.628
and then they get put
into this exploitable working situation.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.255
[Chang] You immigrated here

39:43.339 --> 39:47.885
in a way that most people only find out
about on the news or newspaper.

39:47.968 --> 39:50.554
You actually, you know, did it.

39:50.638 --> 39:57.520
[in Spanish] When someone decides
to immigrate by crossing the desert,

39:57.603 --> 40:03.109
there are rattlesnakes.
It's really hot and really cold.

40:03.192 --> 40:05.277
You risk your life.

40:05.361 --> 40:11.283
It makes it hard to have
the strength to walk here.

40:11.367 --> 40:16.330
But when you have the goal
of changing your family's life,

40:16.414 --> 40:19.208
you can do difficult things.

40:22.795 --> 40:25.798
[Miller in English] Being silent
about something that affects you

40:25.881 --> 40:27.967
is being complicit.

40:28.050 --> 40:29.593
Everyone that's worked
in the restaurant industry

40:29.677 --> 40:31.053
has worked with undocumented people.

40:31.137 --> 40:33.889
If these voices started to come out
of the woodwork,

40:33.973 --> 40:35.808
that could create a sea change,

40:35.891 --> 40:39.562
it could create a culture shift,
and bring the conversation to the public.

40:40.729 --> 40:42.940
[in Spanish]
It doesn't scare me to be public,

40:43.023 --> 40:45.818
because someone has to tell the story

40:45.901 --> 40:47.027
and change it.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.779
[Chang in English]
You guys pay your taxes.

40:48.863 --> 40:49.780
Yeah.

40:49.864 --> 40:51.907
[Chang] You guys employ people.

40:51.991 --> 40:54.368
-You guys create jobs.
-Yeah, we create jobs.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.537
We offer our space
for the community.

40:56.620 --> 40:59.623
[in Spanish] We are hardworking people.

40:59.707 --> 41:04.545
We are not doing bad things.
We're helping the country.

41:05.754 --> 41:09.008
[in English] Either we're going
to change the system

41:09.091 --> 41:10.885
or we're gonna be deported.

41:13.012 --> 41:14.763
[Chang] I guess I'm just still questioning

41:14.847 --> 41:20.102
the validity and the power that food
can actually change things. Right?

41:20.186 --> 41:24.064
I don't know how much people
actually really care about food.

41:24.148 --> 41:26.609
It's a long struggle. You know?

41:26.692 --> 41:29.612
-Just one person by one person.
-But acceptance takes time.

41:29.695 --> 41:31.030
-Yeah.
-Takes years.

41:31.113 --> 41:34.116
I wanna live in a society
that people are not afraid

41:34.200 --> 41:37.077
and not being kept under the shadows
and people can be themselves.

41:37.161 --> 41:40.372
Because I know and you know
diversity is strength.

41:40.456 --> 41:44.001
And we need that diversity.
That's the American Dream.

41:44.084 --> 41:46.962
But we need to continually work
to get there.

41:49.089 --> 41:51.800
-One taco at a time.
-Yeah, one taco at a time.

41:54.303 --> 41:55.304
[Chang] I always think about my dad.

41:55.387 --> 41:57.306
He came to this country,
he washed dishes...

41:58.516 --> 42:03.395
bussed tables, was a handyman
for years, right?

42:03.479 --> 42:06.774
It was the one job he could get
without having to speak English.

42:06.857 --> 42:09.652
So I've always had, not just a soft spot,

42:09.735 --> 42:14.949
but being able to empathize with people
who wanna better their place in the world.

42:34.301 --> 42:36.845
[Meehan] How did you come back to Mexico?

42:36.929 --> 42:39.139
I was deported twice from the States.

42:39.223 --> 42:40.599
-Twice?
-Twice.

42:40.683 --> 42:45.771
The first time I got deported,
I was going to stay in Mexico,

42:45.854 --> 42:49.024
and, uh, my father
was diagnosed with cancer.

42:49.108 --> 42:53.529
So, my mother...
All my family are Americans except me.

42:55.030 --> 42:59.118
She told me, "You have to come back,
because your father is very ill."

43:00.160 --> 43:01.537
And I took that chance.

43:01.620 --> 43:04.164
If I was to be caught
crossing that border,

43:04.873 --> 43:09.420
I would have been put back in jail
for however many years.

43:09.503 --> 43:14.717
And after seven years of living
in the States, I was deported again.

43:14.800 --> 43:18.095
This time,
because I was becoming well-known.

43:18.178 --> 43:20.222
I was in newspapers and magazines.

43:20.306 --> 43:22.433
And they just came for me.

43:24.059 --> 43:26.854
I left a family behind.
I left a son behind.

43:29.356 --> 43:33.694
Enrique gave me an opportunity,
and I worked for him for three years

43:33.777 --> 43:36.071
as his chef de cuisine.

43:36.155 --> 43:39.158
After that,
I opened my restaurant with my wife.

43:39.241 --> 43:43.829
And five years later, here we are.
120 employees...

43:43.954 --> 43:44.913
[Meehan] Wow.

43:44.997 --> 43:47.374
...and we're about to open one in Dubai.

43:47.458 --> 43:49.251
Can you go back to the States?

43:49.335 --> 43:50.919
-Never.
-Never?

43:51.003 --> 43:54.882
I can never go back to the States.
I am banned for life.

43:57.134 --> 44:00.054
There are so many people like me...

44:00.137 --> 44:01.013
Living that life.

44:01.096 --> 44:05.601
A lot of times, people think,
"Yeah. I am an illegal. I'm gonna hide,

44:05.684 --> 44:10.856
because I don't want society to know
that I'm a bad person."

44:10.939 --> 44:14.068
But it's okay,
and it's okay for you to succeed.

44:14.693 --> 44:16.862
-This is why I tell my story.
-Right.

44:22.201 --> 44:25.788
[Arellano] I just want people to
understand that a taco is not just a taco.

44:26.580 --> 44:30.417
A taco is culture. A taco is history.
A taco is migration.

44:30.501 --> 44:34.588
A taco is, you know, resistance.
Politics. All of that stuff.

44:34.672 --> 44:38.509
But it's hard because, too often in
foodie culture, people just want to eat.

44:38.592 --> 44:40.594
They don't wanna think
about what they eat.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.721
-Do you think that's gonna change?
-[Arellano] Let's hope.

44:42.805 --> 44:46.183
[Chang] Do you feel that people are more
receptive to learning about food

44:46.266 --> 44:47.768
and the history behind it?

44:47.851 --> 44:50.938
I think that it's become a currency,
so that's made it more interesting.

44:51.021 --> 44:55.234
The way people talk about sports or
the way people talk about bands, you know?

44:55.317 --> 44:58.612
If you're the guy who knows
what that place serves and why it's good,

44:58.695 --> 45:00.197
then suddenly, that's worth something.

45:00.280 --> 45:05.119
I think that that's an incentive for
the improved cultural position of food.

45:10.457 --> 45:12.960
[Meehan] When I was writing
about restaurants for the Times,

45:13.043 --> 45:16.797
I watched cheeseburgers go from something
that you ate at fast food restaurants

45:16.880 --> 45:19.675
to be something that like,
fine dining chefs took seriously,

45:19.758 --> 45:22.219
but, like, it's a cheeseburger.

45:25.556 --> 45:28.517
There's a lot of foods
that have transitioned over time,

45:28.600 --> 45:31.979
and it's about cultural awareness
and it's about cultural acceptance.

45:32.062 --> 45:34.064
[Enrique Olvera speaking Spanish]

45:34.148 --> 45:37.526
[Meehan in English] The role that chefs
like Enrique play in it

45:37.609 --> 45:42.114
is challenging people's conception
of what a taco can be.

45:43.532 --> 45:46.618
And part of that is just putting it
in a more refined setting and saying,

45:46.702 --> 45:48.871
"You know you wanna be
eating fucking tacos,

45:48.954 --> 45:52.249
so, like, come to my fine restaurant,
have some nice wine and have tacos.

45:52.332 --> 45:54.376
'Cause that's what you wanted, anyway."

45:56.044 --> 45:59.381
[Olvera] This is a project we have been
working on for a couple of years.

46:00.299 --> 46:05.929
I have always been obsessed
with how the Japanese treat rice and fish

46:06.013 --> 46:08.640
in an almost life-changing way.

46:08.724 --> 46:12.352
So we decided that we wanted
to do that with tacos.

46:13.812 --> 46:15.814
It's four components, always.

46:16.398 --> 46:18.358
A single-origin tortilla.

46:20.027 --> 46:23.363
The main component
that is cooked over the coal.

46:23.447 --> 46:26.200
The herbs. And the salsa.

46:27.201 --> 46:29.161
So this is only for the omakase.

46:29.244 --> 46:31.580
Is the omakase
what you're doing at the taco bar?

46:31.663 --> 46:32.706
-Yes.
-Okay.

46:32.789 --> 46:35.250
-For lack of a better word.
-No, yeah. [chuckles]

46:36.627 --> 46:38.128
[Olvera] Soft-shell capeado,

46:39.796 --> 46:44.885
which is the butter with the soft shell,
powdered chili, and the...

46:44.968 --> 46:47.638
-[Meehan] The mix of garden herbs.
-[Olvera] The mix of garden herbs.

46:47.721 --> 46:49.348
So, it's always the same format.

46:52.100 --> 46:56.104
-Amazing, no? Mmm-hmm.
-Fantastic. I want 12 more.

46:59.149 --> 47:02.653
[Olvera] This is cauliflower
deep-fried in chicken fat.

47:04.112 --> 47:08.242
And then the chicken chicharron
and onions.

47:08.325 --> 47:10.327
And then, this is a salsa macha.

47:11.537 --> 47:13.121
Use a lot of the salsa.

47:13.705 --> 47:14.831
That's my favorite.

47:15.749 --> 47:19.461
There's like a mix between
respect and understanding

47:19.545 --> 47:22.965
that there's a few things
you can call Mexican.

47:23.048 --> 47:25.342
Because there's so many influences.

47:25.425 --> 47:30.055
I think being Mexican
is also being open to other ideas.

47:42.067 --> 47:43.860
It's almost like they've done this before.

47:49.408 --> 47:50.450
[Sanchez exclaims]

47:51.410 --> 47:52.703
[Sanchez] It looks amazing.

47:53.161 --> 47:54.496
Oh, look at...

47:54.580 --> 47:55.789
[all laughing]

47:56.832 --> 47:59.668
-[Sanchez] Ooh! Wow.
-[Meehan] It's hot.

48:01.336 --> 48:02.254
[smacks lips] Mmm.

48:03.630 --> 48:05.882
[Meehan] The whole thing together
is pretty fucking amazing.

48:05.966 --> 48:12.931
It's just that idea of like, getting
to taste something that's from a place.

48:13.015 --> 48:14.349
[Sanchez] Ooh!

48:15.976 --> 48:18.312
[Meehan] I've had this in Chicago
and New York and Los Angeles,

48:18.395 --> 48:23.233
and escalating versions of it
being better or worse,

48:23.317 --> 48:27.738
but to like, be sitting here and eating it
in the place that it's from,

48:27.821 --> 48:30.657
surrounded by all the things
it's made from...

48:31.491 --> 48:33.952
-This is stunning. Right?
-[Sanchez] It's amazing.

48:38.040 --> 48:39.666
-[Sanchez in Spanish] Qué rico, eh?
-[Meehan in English] Yeah.

48:40.792 --> 48:43.086
-[Sanchez] It does something, right?
-[Meehan] Yeah. It really does.

48:43.170 --> 48:48.800
I mean, it feels, like, purposeful
and connected and right and just, like...

48:49.926 --> 48:53.889
it's the perfect place to be eating
and experiencing this.

49:09.363 --> 49:10.822
I'm just gonna put this here, please?

49:10.906 --> 49:14.242
'Cause I'm gonna use it over there,
if that's okay? Thank you very much.

49:16.662 --> 49:19.831
This is the first time
I've actually had the chance

49:19.915 --> 49:21.083
to cook in Mexico.

49:22.125 --> 49:24.670
And it's been insanely inspiring.

49:25.420 --> 49:30.217
I'm taking so many references and flavors
to my palate and new flavors.

49:30.300 --> 49:32.803
So it's been an incredible experience.

49:38.016 --> 49:42.020
So we just put a little bit
of this tropical chile salsa

49:42.104 --> 49:44.773
with ginger and coconut fat.

49:46.400 --> 49:49.486
It's very spicy, pretty.

49:49.569 --> 49:52.739
Kind of resonates a lot
with where we are right now.

49:54.157 --> 49:55.575
[speaks in Spanish]

49:58.912 --> 50:01.915
[in English] Then we do an egg yolk salsa.

50:01.998 --> 50:04.167
So it's a spicy egg yolk.

50:04.251 --> 50:07.254
Just the egg yolk
and a little bit of, uh, habanero.

50:13.593 --> 50:15.429
[band playing music]

50:30.318 --> 50:33.822
Why Mexico? What is it about your culture
that makes you guys so open?

50:33.905 --> 50:38.285
I'm just, again, floored at how willing
and accepting you are of other ideas.

50:38.368 --> 50:40.871
[Arellano] We're not afraid of new things.
Let's put it this way.

50:40.954 --> 50:43.331
Everyone likes to mythologize America
as a melting pot,

50:43.415 --> 50:45.751
which, yeah,
it's true to a certain extent,

50:45.834 --> 50:47.461
but there's always been
that xenophobic streak.

50:47.544 --> 50:49.713
In Mexico, we love everyone. Everyone.

50:56.344 --> 50:59.306
[Sanchez] Yeah, I kinda wanna,
I hope, one day move to Mexico.

50:59.389 --> 51:01.475
-What?
-I mean, I would love to.

51:01.558 --> 51:03.643
-But, like--
-It definitely has me thinking.

51:03.727 --> 51:05.395
So what changed?

51:05.479 --> 51:07.355
It just feels right, you know?

51:07.439 --> 51:10.442
And it feels right
to be alongside those products.

51:10.525 --> 51:12.319
And you get to Mexico,

51:12.402 --> 51:15.238
and suddenly everything's there
and everything's perfect, you know?

51:15.322 --> 51:19.493
And for me, it's just given me
a little more confidence to...

51:19.576 --> 51:24.956
Like I said, "Fuck it. Just gonna do it."
And it's amazing to feel like that.

51:25.040 --> 51:26.500
[music continues]

51:29.461 --> 51:31.254
-Cheers, guys.
-[all] Cheers.

51:31.338 --> 51:33.632
[Arellano]
To tacos, to Rosio, to all of us.

51:33.715 --> 51:35.383
-Thank you.
-[Arellano] To the mexicanos.

51:37.886 --> 51:41.431
All right, David. We have a gift for you
that all the kids are gonna beat up.

51:41.515 --> 51:42.474
[Sanchez and Chang] Ah...

51:42.557 --> 51:44.434
I think it looks like you.
What do you think?

51:44.518 --> 51:46.645
-It definitely has the head size right.
-[chuckles]

51:50.941 --> 51:52.692
[cheering]

51:52.776 --> 51:55.237
-[Chang] I'm too tough.
-[Arellano chuckles]

51:55.320 --> 51:57.405
-I'm the Terminator.
-Too tough to die!

51:58.490 --> 52:00.075
-[all cheering]
-[Chang] Yeah!

52:00.158 --> 52:01.284
[Arellano] Whoo!

52:04.287 --> 52:06.289
