00:06.840 --> 00:09.252
This bagel's as hard
as a hockey puck.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.332
Then don't eat it.

00:10.427 --> 00:13.169
Used to be a full
breakfast service.
They're trying to starve us.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.003
You're worried
about the food?

00:15.098 --> 00:17.350
(SIGHING) No,
I'm worried about what
the food represents.

00:17.434 --> 00:20.346
I've got seven scenes
to shoot today on half
of what we used to spend.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.598
We're going through
a recession.
It is what it is.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.475
Yeah, but nobody's
gonna bai| us out.

00:24.566 --> 00:27.808
Free content everywhere,
DVD sales in the toilet,

00:27.903 --> 00:31.145
now the back-office
bean counters are
vetoing half my ideas.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.448
So we can kind of make it
about the performances.

00:34.910 --> 00:35.865
You okay?

00:35.953 --> 00:37.068
Bit of a headache.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.322
If you need
an ibuprofen...

00:38.413 --> 00:39.994
I need you to put
your game face on,
right?

00:40.082 --> 00:42.289
Screw the bagels,
screw the sets,
screw the wardrobe.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.367
You have any idea
how lucky we are?

00:44.461 --> 00:46.042
We get to do
something we like,

00:46.129 --> 00:49.587
we get to touch
people's lives, and
we get paid for it.

00:49.675 --> 00:51.165
Let's make a movie.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.670
Hey, baby.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.639
All right.
Roll camera.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.760
And

01:04.356 --> 01:05.562
acﬂon.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.855
(GROANING)

01:12.281 --> 01:13.771
RICK: What's wrong?

01:14.575 --> 01:17.863
(GROANING) My eyes.
They feel like
they're exploding.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.494
All right. Turn off
the damn light.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.618
Get an ambulance. Now!

02:01.038 --> 02:03.450
We're gonna be
late for work.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.700
Then we'll be late.

02:09.254 --> 02:12.121
You took a patient's life.
You lied about it for weeks,

02:12.215 --> 02:15.753
you broke who knows
how many laws and
oaths to cover it up,

02:16.470 --> 02:18.381
but I can live with it.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.469
We can get
through it together.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.352
(SIGHING)

02:26.063 --> 02:28.725
You have no idea what
I've been living with,

02:28.815 --> 02:31.306
and what it means
to hear you say that.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.609
But we need to get away
from Princeton-Plainsboro.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.858
You can barely walk
by the rooms where
Dibala was treated.

02:40.952 --> 02:44.410
Why should we live
with that hanging
over our heads?

02:45.457 --> 02:48.870
If there was ever
a time to turn the page...

02:53.924 --> 02:55.414
Three-month-old with fever,

02:55.509 --> 02:58.216
incessant drooling,
and chronic muscle weakness.

02:58.303 --> 03:05.015
Or porn actor Hank Hardwick,
born Henry Lefkowitz,
totally clean workup,

03:05.102 --> 03:07.343
collapsed on the job
with extreme photophobia.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.519
Or an infant as limp
as a rag doll.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.688
Yeah. Let's wait till
Chase and Cameron get here.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.936
l have the feeling
they'll have the good sense
to side with me.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.313
Doesn't matter
who they side with,
I'm still in charge.

03:16.405 --> 03:18.612
We're taking the
limp three-month-old.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.736
Oh, good, you paged
the limpness specialist.

03:27.582 --> 03:31.541
This envelope is oddly
medical-licensed shaped.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.873
Congratulations.

03:38.009 --> 03:41.501
House is back in charge.
We get to treat a porn star.

03:41.930 --> 03:42.885
Congratulations.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.964
Perfect timing for us.

03:45.058 --> 03:49.176
We're leaving the team
and the hospital,
effective immediately.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.103
It's kind of sudden.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.272
Unless you've been
circulating your
resumes for a while.

03:54.359 --> 03:57.271
We're just starting
to think about newjobs,
where we want to live.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.603
Moving, too.
Interesting.

03:59.698 --> 04:00.858
Are you sure about this?

04:02.826 --> 04:03.941
Yes.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.326
We'll miss you.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.405
We'll miss all of you, too.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.206
We'll start clearing
out our things.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.588
HOUSE:
Run an STD panel
and a tox screen,

04:18.675 --> 04:21.041
send a C-reactive protein
to look for inflammation

04:21.136 --> 04:23.001
and an ANA to screen
for autoimmune.

04:23.096 --> 04:27.635
The rest of you take
a history and do an LP to rule
out viral encephalitis.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.724
Oh, it's just you.

04:31.313 --> 04:34.271
Here's hoping you're
good at multitasking.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.232
I get tested
for STDs regularly,

04:38.320 --> 04:39.400
so does everyone
I work with.

04:39.488 --> 04:42.525
Since I'm guessing
you don't take
their word for it...

04:42.616 --> 04:47.576
All right. I'm gonna need you
to lie on your side and put
your knees to your chest.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.039
Any history of alcohol
or substance abuse?

04:50.123 --> 04:54.457
My wife used to smoke
a little pot, but I
never touch the stuff.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.875
You're married?

04:55.962 --> 04:58.123
Happily.
Two years now.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.376
She happy you do porn?

05:00.467 --> 05:02.879
Very.
Since she does it, too.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.091
You ever get jealous
when your wife's working?

05:07.182 --> 05:08.547
It's a job.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.053
Once you start
letting your work life
rule your home life,

05:11.144 --> 05:14.887
especially if you're in
the same line of work, your
relationship's gonna be short.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.393
You're gonna feel
a little pressure.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.940
Any history of sexual abuse?

05:19.027 --> 05:20.733
l defy the cliche.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.903
Have you ever suffered
depression or psychosis?

05:22.989 --> 05:26.573
Let me save you some time.
There's not a blotch
on my medical record.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.072
Look, I know most
of the people in my field

05:29.162 --> 05:31.403
are drug addicts
with daddy issues.

05:31.498 --> 05:35.491
But I'm a nice Jewish
boy from the 'burbs.
I wasn't driven to this.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.124

05:40.215 --> 05:42.331
My arms are killing me.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.586
Looks like tetany.
Your muscles are
contracting.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.884
Need some meperidine in here.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.427
Oh, God.

photophobia,
and muscle spasm.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.595
You tell me which
is the most unusual.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.939
Four candidates,
three slots on the team.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.312
Need to know if
you've still got
your diagnostic chops.

06:02.404 --> 06:04.645
I leave this office
by 6:00 every day.

06:04.739 --> 06:07.151
l have my weekends again.
I recognize my wife again.

06:07.242 --> 06:10.780
Yeah, I agree, does sound
pretty dull. No wonder
you want to work for me.

06:10.871 --> 06:14.534
Tox screen was clean,
we ruled out
viral encephalitis.

06:19.045 --> 06:22.958
The only obstacle
to you coming back
is your wife,

06:23.925 --> 06:27.292
which has never been
that much of an
obstacle to you.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.216
(SIGHS)

06:31.391 --> 06:33.177
Maybe you're right.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.428
The only link between eye
and muscle is the brain.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.388
Tumor, seizure...

06:44.029 --> 06:46.896
Taub seems to think
the link has to be
the brain,

06:46.990 --> 06:48.196
but eye and muscle
are governed

06:48.283 --> 06:53.573
by different parts of
the patient's second-favorite
organ, which means it's...

06:54.372 --> 06:56.658
Thailand was wonderful,
thanks for asking.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.492
Of course, yes,
it has to be multi-focal.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.202
l have an interview
with a community health
clinic in two hours.

07:02.297 --> 07:05.289
Backup plan's fine,
but Taub's swinging
for the fences.

07:05.383 --> 07:06.884
| suggest you don't
divide your attention.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.926
Good point.
I won't divide
my attention then.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.296
HOUSE: Taub thinks
it's a brain issue,

07:12.390 --> 07:14.005
Thirteen thinks
it's multi-focal.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.761
FOREMAN:
And neither of them
wants to work here.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.092
Don't take
their word for it.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.599
Taub's problem is his wife,
Thirteen's problem is you,

07:19.689 --> 07:22.601
Chase and Cameron's problem
is the dead African dictator.

07:22.692 --> 07:25.354
None of them
has a problem
with the work.

07:25.737 --> 07:29.150
Cerebral vasculitis
would explain both
the eye and arm findings.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.368
Steroids to treat,
brain angiogram
to confirm,

07:32.452 --> 07:36.365
EMG and a nerve biopsy
while you're at it.
I'll be at lunch.

07:36.456 --> 07:40.995
l'd hire all four,
but a five-person
team seems unwieldy.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.998
Who would you turn down?

07:44.506 --> 07:46.462
I'll have whatever
he's buying.

07:46.549 --> 07:49.416
Two cheeseburgers
and two large fries.

07:49.511 --> 07:52.628
There are a thousand
people in the world who
want to be on your staff,

07:52.722 --> 07:54.633
but you're going after
the four who don't.

07:54.724 --> 07:59.138
They don't because their lives
are irrelevantly and
annoyingly complicated,

07:59.229 --> 08:02.266
which makes them confused,
which makes them
make poor decisions.

08:02.357 --> 08:03.767
And your life is simple?

08:03.858 --> 08:06.725
You went all the way up
to the medical conference
to cozy up to Cuddy.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.483
Instead, she's dating one
of two people in the world
you think of as a friend.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.313
There's no way
that's not devastating.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.445
So I had
an attraction of sorts.

08:14.536 --> 08:15.901
Yeah, the sort in which

08:15.996 --> 08:19.159
your imaginary tryst
landed you in
a mental hospital.

08:19.708 --> 08:22.450
And I got help,
and she got Lucas,

08:22.544 --> 08:25.160
who bought me
a ginger ale.
It's all fine.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.079
Which won't be true
of my department

08:27.173 --> 08:30.415
unless I can figure out
which doctor I'm not hiring.

08:30.885 --> 08:35.595
I suppose throwing yourself
into your work isn't
the worst thing you could do.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.469
What is the worst
thing I could do?

08:38.810 --> 08:39.890
(SIGHS)

08:39.978 --> 08:41.843
House thinks
it's cerebral vasculitis.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.350
If you could just do
the brain angio while
I finish up the blood work...

08:44.441 --> 08:45.556
We're out the door.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.641
He's got me running
every test and
treatment by myself.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.522
Which is why
you should be
out the door, too.

08:49.612 --> 08:52.649
This is completely
unreasonable,
even for House.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.197
You owe me this.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.000
Thank you.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.705
You really believe
this is cerebral vasculitis?

09:05.795 --> 09:06.830
Could be.

09:06.921 --> 09:07.956
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

09:08.048 --> 09:10.460
House wants
to thread a catheter
through his brain,

09:10.550 --> 09:11.915
which could cause
a vasospasm,

09:12.010 --> 09:14.251
give steroids, which
could spread infection
all over the place,

09:14.345 --> 09:15.471
because it could be.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.136
Sounds like House.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.056
It could also be
a severe vitamin D
deficiency.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.885
He has a restrictive diet,
works long hours indoors,

09:22.979 --> 09:26.346
became hypocalcemic,
got tetany and photophobia.

09:26.441 --> 09:27.851
You're saying
I shouldn't do
the angio?

09:27.942 --> 09:30.399
House ordered it,
Foreman wants it,
of course we should do it.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.023
I'm just saying
we're right to leave.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.694
You sure?

09:33.782 --> 09:36.068
Because right now
I'd basically do anything
you asked me.

09:36.159 --> 09:39.777
I'm not interested
in guilting you.
We're moving on.

09:42.165 --> 09:45.157
Right after I take
the patient to the
phototherapy suite,

09:45.251 --> 09:47.663
blast him with
ultraviolet light
and IV vitamins

09:47.754 --> 09:50.370
for his severe
vitamin D deficiency.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.008
Do you guys actually
work together?

09:56.096 --> 09:59.588
We did at first.
But now we like to keep
our films pretty separate.

09:59.682 --> 10:02.389
So, do you
watch her work?

10:02.477 --> 10:04.593
We're both busy
with our own stuff.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.096
Think what you want,
but we're proud
of what we do.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.398
Divorcing sex from
all emotional content?

10:10.485 --> 10:13.067
Emotion is emotional,
sex is mechanical.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.440
There doesn't really
need to be any overlap.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.614
Certainly not
in your world.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.778
We've helped
a lot of couples

10:19.869 --> 10:22.736
by taking sex out of
some deep, dark dungeon.

10:22.831 --> 10:26.369
Do what you want
without some big
moral comeuppance.

10:26.459 --> 10:30.043
You think you can
escape the consequences,
but you can't.

your own rules and morals.

Left shift points
to bacteremia.

11:29.772 --> 11:33.890
No fever, plus it wouldn't
explain the spasmodic
muscle contractions.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.685
The ball-and-chain
smacked you down.

11:36.779 --> 11:40.863
But widespread petechial rash,
nervous system involvement...

11:41.451 --> 11:45.239
It's some kind
of blood infection.
Meningococcemia.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.207
Start the patient
on heparin for the DIC,

11:48.291 --> 11:51.249
broad-spectrum antibiotics
for the meningococcemia.

11:52.420 --> 11:53.785
Dr. Cameron.

11:55.924 --> 11:59.667
Chase is relaxed, at ease,
in lock-step with you again.

11:59.761 --> 12:03.049
I guess he finally told you
that he iced Idi Amin Jr.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.505
Does that mean
he can break the other
nine commandments, too?

12:05.600 --> 12:07.306
Taking the Lord's
name in vain, sure,

12:07.393 --> 12:10.009
but coveting thy
neighbor's wife?

12:10.104 --> 12:11.480
Is she hot?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.555
I've forgiven him.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.231
Not for murder.
Not you.

12:15.318 --> 12:17.354
Doesn't matter
how evil Dibala was.

12:17.445 --> 12:21.313
By every conscience-
hugging, Mother-Teresa-
Ioving bone in your body,

12:21.407 --> 12:23.398
you should be leaving him,
not leaving with him.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.324
I thought your position
was our leaving is a ruse.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.571
We're not talking
about my position,

12:26.663 --> 12:28.244
we're talking about yours,
which doesn't add up.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.993
Here's what doesn't add up.
If you were serious
about staffing your team,

12:31.084 --> 12:33.700
you would know exactly
which three fellows
you wanted.

12:33.795 --> 12:36.753
You plowed ahead with
this case even though
you hadn't hired new fellows

12:36.839 --> 12:39.421
because you knew
Foreman would ask
Chase and me to help,

12:39.509 --> 12:41.591
giving you more time
to blow up our marriage.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.088
But we'd be foolish
not to plan ahead.

12:46.182 --> 12:50.266
A, my firing Chase
was the only reason
you left two years ago.

12:50.353 --> 12:55.097
B, when the full horror
of his homicide hits you,
your marriage will blow up.

12:55.191 --> 12:59.355
And Z, the only
obstacle of you working
here will be gone.

13:01.531 --> 13:04.364
Or maybe I skipped
a couple of letters.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.612
Meningococcemia's spread
person-to-person.

13:10.707 --> 13:14.120
Something you ought
to think about next time
you show up for work.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.249
I'm just telling you what...

13:19.340 --> 13:22.127
You have to lecture me
when she's around, I get it.

13:22.218 --> 13:26.962
But I can tell from all the
questions you ask that you're
more like me than you admit.

13:27.056 --> 13:31.550
I'm a guy, I look around
every once in a while,
but I love my wife.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.976
I love the fact that
she's the only one
that I'm intimate with.

13:34.063 --> 13:39.103
And no part of you wants
to just toss this rulebook
everyone's forced on you?

13:39.193 --> 13:41.980
No part of you
wants a life of
actual commitment?

13:42.071 --> 13:44.562
Is my relationship
perfect? No.

13:45.408 --> 13:49.492
Am I ever horny when
my wife has just had sex
for nine hours? Yes.

13:50.872 --> 13:54.160
But we are committed
to each other in
every way that matters.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.831
In other words,
you're committed,

13:55.918 --> 13:58.409
except when you're
not committed.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.790
Doesn't work so well
if you have a conscience.

14:00.882 --> 14:03.965
Conscience?
You mean that thing
that kicks in

14:04.052 --> 14:08.170
when there's no logical
reason to behave the way
people want you to?

14:08.848 --> 14:10.258
(BEEPING)

14:10.350 --> 14:12.432
What?
You have a fever.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.598
Means the antibiotics
aren't working.

14:18.441 --> 14:20.523
Mr. Takayama?

14:20.610 --> 14:21.725
Yes.

14:22.403 --> 14:25.190
I'm really happy
with what the last guy
did with my eyes,

14:25.281 --> 14:29.490
but why would broad-spectrum
antibiotics fail to work on
meningococcemia?

14:29.577 --> 14:32.819
If you'll excuse me,
I've got a real patient. Mr...

14:34.749 --> 14:36.205
Hitler? Really?

14:36.292 --> 14:39.705
I had to do something to amuse
myself while your receptionist
fought with her boyfriend.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.036
Who's next?

14:41.130 --> 14:44.839
A guy who needs two decades'
worth of corn chips
hoovered out of his neck,

14:44.926 --> 14:48.384
or a guy who can't
stand daylight and
whose blood won't clot.

14:48.471 --> 14:49.756
You do the triage.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.053
Who's the jerk?

14:51.140 --> 14:54.132
Someone with zero chance
of hiring me back.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.310
I told you.
I'm content at
home and at work.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.308
But you're not
content with content.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.390
It's why you got sucked
into those stock scams,

15:01.484 --> 15:03.725
why you cheated
on the wife you love.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.310
At bridge.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.855
My wife and I play
a lot of bridge.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.440
Why you worked on the case
the last time I was here.

15:10.535 --> 15:11.570
I gave you a theory,

15:11.661 --> 15:13.993
just like I'd help a guy
who needs a Heimlich
in a restaurant,

15:14.080 --> 15:15.786
and then I shut
the door behind you.

15:15.873 --> 15:18.489
Yeah. But you'd knock
over three other doctors
to give it to him.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.324
Metaphorically speaking,
you're a Heimlich addict.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.705
And you're an
addiction addict.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.582
Right now, your
drug of choice is
your old team,

15:23.673 --> 15:25.789
and like any addict,
you're trying to solve
some other problem,

15:25.883 --> 15:27.999
and it's not gonna work.
If you'll excuse me,
I have a...

15:28.094 --> 15:30.756
You have a tight schedule
of nose jobs and tummy tucks.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.759
Yes, I do nose jobs,
just like the guy who came
here after a car crash,

15:33.850 --> 15:36.432
couldn't even breathe
through his...

15:40.898 --> 15:44.811
Antibiotics wouldn't work
if his sinuses were infected
and clogged,

15:44.902 --> 15:48.986
if there was a pocket
of bacteria his blood
vessels couldn't reach.

15:49.073 --> 15:52.691
You surgically
drain his sinuses,
the drugs will work.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.367
Nice.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.407
Tell me that
didn't feel good.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.913
See you tomorrow.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.034
Not coming back.

16:11.429 --> 16:13.465
Looks like quite a trip.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.049
It was.

16:19.437 --> 16:20.927
House send you
to talk to me?

16:21.022 --> 16:22.057
No.

16:22.148 --> 16:25.766
Then there's nothing
to talk about. I don't
want to work for him.

16:27.278 --> 16:31.237
You're a great doctor.
House is right to want
you in the mix.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.319
You saying this
because you still
have feelings for me

16:34.410 --> 16:35.490
and you want me
to come back?

16:35.578 --> 16:38.069
I'm saying that
shouldn't be an issue.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.746
Do you have feelings
for me or not?

16:41.209 --> 16:44.497
I don't want our work life
to have anything to do
with our personal life.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.418
You couldn't keep
them separate.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.589
And that's why
our personal life
doesn't exist.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.166
None of that has to...

16:52.261 --> 16:54.343
I can't work with you.

16:55.598 --> 16:57.384
Actually, you can.

16:58.476 --> 17:02.344
I was the one who
had the problem.
I don't any more.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.435
(WHIRRING)

17:11.197 --> 17:12.983
HOUSE: / owe you an apology.

17:13.783 --> 17:16.991
(STAMMERING)
/ was... / was...

17:17.870 --> 17:19.986
What were you
wrong about?

17:20.081 --> 17:26.828
You spent weeks elaborately
concealing the fact that
you’d crashed daddy’s car.

17:26.921 --> 17:31.585
Then you just confessed.
Seemed idiotic,
certain to end in disaster.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.835
Instead, you’re riding off
into the sunset together.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.260
Any theories on why?

17:36.347 --> 17:39.965
I assume you've
already dismissed the
"she loves me" theory?

17:40.059 --> 17:41.595
It’s possible.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.551
It would require
the presupposition
that everything

17:43.646 --> 17:45.136
she's done for
the last six years

17:45.231 --> 17:47.062
has been completely
inconsistent with
her character,

17:47.149 --> 17:48.810
but, yeah,
it's possible.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.643
As we've already
established, it's also
possible that you're wrong.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.069
Or there’s another
explanation.

17:54.615 --> 17:58.358
Since you don’t have one,
I’m gonna keep
looking for you.

18:01.998 --> 18:05.832
Let him drain, then pack it
with anesthetics
and sterile gauze.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.535
Do you have any idea
what's going on with House?

18:10.089 --> 18:12.421
He's trying to get
his old fellows back.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.044
It's called stalking.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.006
I am way too busy
to play officer
of the court.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.588
That's a shame,
since you're the one
who triggered this.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.601
What do you see
in Lucas anyway?

18:22.685 --> 18:24.721
I don't see that
it's any of your business.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.427
Did you think House
wouldn't find out?

18:26.522 --> 18:27.728
You could've
at least told me,

18:27.815 --> 18:30.181
so I wouldn't have
coached him on how to prove
his worthiness to you.

18:30.276 --> 18:34.861
I know you're upset with me
because I didn't choose
to date your best friend,

18:34.947 --> 18:37.324
but I'm living my life.

18:37.408 --> 18:38.488
For the first time.

18:38.576 --> 18:43.366
I'm not gonna change that
because of how it might
affect him, or you.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.204
I feel like crap.

18:53.716 --> 18:58.506
Yeah, look, our relationship
is gonna be about House
or it's gonna be about us.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.007
I vote for it
being about us.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.430
House is gonna make
it about him for us.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.600
This is very insulting.
You're apparently
shocked by this,

19:06.687 --> 19:10.225
which means that you
thought that there was some
way that we could date,

19:10.316 --> 19:13.558
get married, have two kids,
a dog, retire to Florida,

19:13.653 --> 19:15.484
all without House
finding out.

19:15.571 --> 19:19.155
Or you thought that
we wouldn't date
all that long.

19:20.076 --> 19:21.316
The first means
you're delusional,

19:21.410 --> 19:23.526
the second means
I'm delusional.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.953
Technically, it could
also mean you thought
House had matured,

19:26.040 --> 19:27.655
but then we're
back to your being...
(WHISTLES SOFTLY)

19:27.750 --> 19:29.240
Shut up.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.918
You're right.
I'm sorry.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.455
I'm also flattered.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.631
Yeah, 'cause you acted
all cool and everything
with Wilson,

19:37.718 --> 19:41.006
but you feel comfortable
enough with me that
you can freak out.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.382
That's cool.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.475
(LAUGHING)

19:49.271 --> 19:53.264
His sinuses are clear.
The antibiotics
should work this time.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.851
Why did you forgive me?

19:57.405 --> 20:01.398
I mean, I'm glad,
I'm grateful,
but I'm confused.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.699
You've been harder
on the patient than
you've been on me.

20:03.786 --> 20:09.577
The difference between
you and the patient is
that you feel shame, guilt.

20:10.835 --> 20:13.918
That's how I know
we're gonna get
through this.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.086
(HANK GROANING)

20:16.173 --> 20:17.674
My stomach.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.174
It really hurts.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.463
His liver's failing.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.887
His liver's failing and
his abdomen keeps
filling with fluid, so...

20:32.982 --> 20:34.313
It's not meningococcemia.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.437
No matter how much
you finish each
other's sentences,

20:37.528 --> 20:40.611
don't count on being
a diagnostic package deal.

20:40.698 --> 20:42.108
Patient's liver's
not working.

20:42.199 --> 20:45.157
We don't have time
for your little team-stakes.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.111
Sometimes you're just
(STUTTERING) wrong.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.326
Something genetic,
something in his family
history we overlooked?

20:53.127 --> 20:55.618
Plus, every time he had
a bad cough as a kid,
he went to a doctor.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.578
Klatskin tumor,
obstructing his bile ducts?

20:57.673 --> 20:59.584
No jaundice,
wouldn't have
ocular effects.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.917
But if it's inflammation
inside the bile channels,
sclerosing cholangitis.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.752
Could've stopped him
from producing
clotting proteins,

21:04.847 --> 21:06.929
damaged his blood cells,
causing small strokes.

21:07.016 --> 21:10.975
Enough,enoughl
Stop pummeling
Thirteen and Taub.

21:13.314 --> 21:16.681
It fits.
Prep the patient
for an ERCP,

21:16.776 --> 21:19.108
see if there's
any hope of opening
his blocked bile channels.

21:19.195 --> 21:22.312
And tell them to start
looking for a liver donor.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.650
Dr. Chase.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.525
Your turn.

21:28.204 --> 21:30.160
So what did she say?

21:30.790 --> 21:34.157
She forgave me
because I feel guilty.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.120
That works, too.

21:36.212 --> 21:39.249
And now you expect me
to ask you what the
"too" refers to?

21:39.340 --> 21:43.674
Only if you're interested.
Only if you have doubts
about her answer.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.762
She thinks that you
don't have anything
to feel guilty about

21:48.849 --> 21:51.636
because you
didn't kill anybody,
I did.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.720
She blames me
for Dibala's murder,
notyou.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.976
You were barely
involved in that case,
she knows that.

21:58.067 --> 22:02.185
But I created the big,
bad, evil climate that
allowed it to happen.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.148
You're wrong.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.650
Powerful
counter-argument.

22:05.741 --> 22:09.484
Why are you doing this?
Why are you trying
to screw things up?

22:09.578 --> 22:11.534
You got the tense wrong.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.321
Things are already
screwed up.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.616
Which is why you
don't just want to work
for me, you need to.

22:16.710 --> 22:19.201
Cameron thinks
you're my personal
sock puppet.

22:19.296 --> 22:23.039
If you don't stay,
it's gonna be hard
to prove you're not.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.669
I have to go.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.438
Last week, my cane
could only do 10 minutes.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.935
What are you
doing here?

22:45.030 --> 22:48.739
Waiting for you
to take a nap so I can
surge into the lead.

22:52.746 --> 22:56.910
What's the best way to
restore the liver in someone
with sclerosing cholangitis?

22:57.001 --> 22:58.116
Not getting
drawn into this.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.370
You already are.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.871
Because you crashed
my workout?

23:00.963 --> 23:03.750
You're doing core training,
which improves balance,

23:03.841 --> 23:07.675
which staves off
the most debilitating
symptoms of Huntington's.

23:07.761 --> 23:10.047
You've ended your
self-destructive streak.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.380
You want to do
something significant,

23:12.474 --> 23:16.342
something that'll last
longer than the few
years you have left.

23:16.937 --> 23:18.928
My team is your
first, best choice.

23:19.023 --> 23:23.938
And my first choice is
the community health clinic
I interviewed with yesterday.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.484
Absolutely,
you should do that.

23:25.571 --> 23:29.280
Three hours a week,
every doctor should,
because every doctor can.

23:29.366 --> 23:31.448
But you don't want
to be every doctor.

23:31.535 --> 23:34.743
Plus, on my team,
you get to screw
with Foreman.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.745
Every way but literally.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.993
Why are you
doing it this way?

23:39.418 --> 23:41.500
You're pretending
to assume we're
all coming back,

23:41.587 --> 23:43.953
without actually
asking us. Why?

23:44.048 --> 23:47.882
See, this is why
you'd be miserable
wiping noses in a clinic.

23:49.470 --> 23:52.883
You can't ask
because you can't
face the rejection.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.179
Why not?
What's going on?

23:54.266 --> 23:55.767
Are you asking me
to ask you?

23:55.851 --> 23:59.389
I'm saying you shouldn't,
for your sake as well as mine.

24:01.607 --> 24:05.566
We don't know how much
the sclerosing cholangitis
has damaged your liver.

24:05.653 --> 24:08.235
It might be
in a year,
might be in 10,

24:09.239 --> 24:12.197
but the odds are
you're gonna need
a new one.

24:13.202 --> 24:18.287
And you should know,
while no transplant committee
will say this openly,

24:18.374 --> 24:22.492
they'll never grant
an organ to someone
working in your profession.

24:23.712 --> 24:26.328
You're saying
I have to change jobs?

24:26.674 --> 24:29.666
You're medically
advising me
to change jobs?

24:29.760 --> 24:30.875
Hank, if you're too sick...

24:30.970 --> 24:32.881
She wants me to
have some kind of
religious conversion.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.462
She's practically
salivating over it.

24:34.556 --> 24:36.342
I'm just being
candid about...

24:36.433 --> 24:40.301
So you don't think
I'm scum, just some
committee thinks I'm scum?

24:40.396 --> 24:42.136
That your lifestyle
has risks.

24:42.231 --> 24:46.065
You work around more
sick people, and germs,
and blood than I do.

24:46.151 --> 24:49.769
I'm not gonna
live my life afraid
like my parents did.

24:49.863 --> 24:54.027
Barely letting me play
outside and God forbid
that I get a scratch.

24:54.994 --> 24:58.077
I'll talk to him.
He'll calm down and realize
that this is the only way.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.494
No. No, lwon't.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.913
Why does everyone
want to dictate the way
I live my life?

25:02.001 --> 25:05.084
Because the way
we're living it
is gonna kill you.

You have no idea
what he said.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.179

I know that House
is manipulative.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.223
I know that you're
in a vulnerable
state right now.

25:20.310 --> 25:24.349
And I know that Cameron
wants your marriage to work,
so do you.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.055
So don't listen
to House.

25:26.150 --> 25:28.607
House doesn't
make my decisions.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.898
I'm in the common bile duct.

25:31.989 --> 25:34.196
What's that mass?
Gallstone?

25:34.908 --> 25:37.035
Can we magnify times five?

25:40.247 --> 25:42.112
That's not a gallstone.

25:43.167 --> 25:46.000
His liver's completely
filled with worms.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.790
CHASE:
You have strongyloides,
also known as threadworms.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.626
They disseminated
all over your body,
causing all your symptoms.

25:54.720 --> 25:55.880
How'd I get a parasite?

25:55.971 --> 25:59.805
Most likely through
sexual activity,
but we can't be sure.

26:00.768 --> 26:02.554
And what's the treatment?

26:02.644 --> 26:04.054
Two mebendazole pills.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.354
That's it?

26:07.441 --> 26:10.979
You'll be fine.
Your liver, too.
Go back to your lives.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.071
You know this is
the doctors' lounge.

26:20.162 --> 26:21.277
I know.

26:21.747 --> 26:24.989
It seemed like the place
to read doctors' notes.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.496
You are good at it,
by the way.

26:28.837 --> 26:31.123
Why are you
reading my charts?

26:31.423 --> 26:34.130
Because I'm worried
about my girlfriend.

26:34.843 --> 26:37.880
Your girlfriend is
a male porn star?

26:37.971 --> 26:39.472
No, I'm dating Lisa Cuddy.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.759
Seriously?
Cool, huh?

26:41.850 --> 26:44.227
And if House
doesn't have his team,
that'll make her miserable,

26:44.311 --> 26:45.892
which will make
me miserable.

26:45.979 --> 26:50.393
Which brings us to the
fact that you have elevated
noting to an art form.

26:50.567 --> 26:51.727
I see the connection.

26:51.819 --> 26:53.104
Most doctors
write "9:00 am."

26:53.195 --> 26:54.776
if they scrub in at 9:00
or anything near it.

26:54.863 --> 26:59.448
You write "9:03" and you make
little notations when
procedures are delayed.

26:59.660 --> 27:01.366
You're easily impressed.

27:01.453 --> 27:04.069
Well, yeah. lwas.

virtually stopped writing them
about four weeks ago.

Got a backlog.

27:09.711 --> 27:15.297
Yeah, people with your
level of precision don't
really just get backlogs.

27:17.344 --> 27:20.302
No one knows why
you're leaving PPTH.

27:20.389 --> 27:21.674
Because it's personal.

27:22.391 --> 27:23.471
If something happened...

27:23.559 --> 27:26.892
I mean, if you're leaving
to get away from something
that you did, or she did,

27:26.979 --> 27:28.640
or both of you did...

27:28.730 --> 27:31.893
I mean, emotionally, maybe
you want to run away,
but in my experience,

27:31.984 --> 27:35.977
if you're staring
at a pit bull in
some guy's back yard,

27:36.738 --> 27:39.150
you're better off
staying right
where you are.

27:39.241 --> 27:42.483
Face the problem,
that way it can't bite
you in the ass.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.326
Thanks for

three of these doctors?

35:20.327 --> 35:24.491
Because I think we're wrong,
which means something's
gonna go wrong.

35:24.581 --> 35:26.697
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

35:26.791 --> 35:28.122
Or right.

35:28.209 --> 35:29.289
Takayama here.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.538
It's me and Thirteen,
stop the ablation.

35:34.674 --> 35:35.754
Because”.

35:35.842 --> 35:36.922
TH I RTE E N:
Those threadworms.

35:37.010 --> 35:39.843
Why would his body have
gone to hell just hours
after they were gone?

35:39.929 --> 35:41.965
The worms weren't hurting him,
they were helping him.

35:42.057 --> 35:44.298
He has
extra-intestinal
Crohn's.

35:44.392 --> 35:46.644
He got it from being
raised in too clean,

35:46.728 --> 35:48.468
too overprotective
of an environment.

35:48.563 --> 35:49.803
TH I RTE E N:
It’s the hygiene hypothesis,

35:49.898 --> 35:52.264
why there’s so much
autoimmune disease
in the developed world,

35:52.359 --> 35:53.974
and almost none in
the developing world.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.151
TAUB:
The worms were keeping
the Crohn’s in check,

35:56.237 --> 36:00.071
teaching his immune system
what it should've learned
from eating dirt growing up.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.399
Once you killed them,
it started killing him.

36:03.328 --> 36:08.197
So his life of filth
wasn't the problem,
the clean living was.

36:09.084 --> 36:10.824
We'll start him
on methylprednisolone.

36:10.919 --> 36:12.705
And some helminths.

36:14.714 --> 36:16.921
Worms. Cool, huh?

36:18.927 --> 36:20.713
Best out of three?

36:23.932 --> 36:25.012
(MUSIC PLAYING ON TV)

WOMAN ON TV:
Have you been
a bad boy?

36:30.355 --> 36:31.720
(WOMAN LAUGHING)

36:31.815 --> 36:33.351
Yeah, that’s...

36:33.441 --> 36:35.147
(TV SWITCHES OFF)

36:38.780 --> 36:40.941
I want to be on the team.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.363
Good news for your wife.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.192
Thanks for the sarcasm.

36:45.286 --> 36:48.870
I reorganized my life
to spend more time with her,

36:48.957 --> 36:51.539
but apparently
I don't love her
as much as I thought.

36:51.626 --> 36:53.537
Or you love her more.

36:54.129 --> 36:58.338
This job gives you
the thrill you used to find
through philandering.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.875
Better to cheat with
a beaker and an MRI

37:01.970 --> 37:05.633
than one of your
platinum-blonde
plastic surgery patients.

37:07.809 --> 37:09.470
I'll let you know.

37:28.329 --> 37:31.162
I told House
I want to work
for him again.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.495
Stay on the team.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.084
You were always
more into it than I was,

37:37.172 --> 37:39.879
more interested
in diagnostics.

37:40.633 --> 37:43.625
Unless House was right
about why you want out.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.516
Four for four.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.520
I was in love with you.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.320
I was an idiot.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.576
Tried to be like you,
tried to understand you,

38:10.663 --> 38:13.700
because I thought
I could heal you.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.206
You almost killed
that patient.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.253
If almost not saving
his life means...

38:21.341 --> 38:23.457
You knew the diagnosis
a long time ago.

38:23.551 --> 38:26.588
You risked another
patient's life to bait
your old team.

38:26.679 --> 38:28.135
Another one?

38:28.223 --> 38:29.588
You did kill Dibala.

38:30.475 --> 38:33.467
By playing God
and teaching us
to do the same.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.142
Itaughtyou
to think for
yourselves.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.470
You don't even think
of them as people,

38:36.564 --> 38:39.055
they're just lab rats
for your little puzzles.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.390
You celebrate
their humanity,

38:40.485 --> 38:42.817
I'd rather solve
those little puzzles
and save their lives.

38:42.904 --> 38:46.067
Motives do matter.
Lives can't come second.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.819
The patient is alive.
That's what matters.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.320
Not to you.

38:50.411 --> 38:54.154
All you care about is
that Taub and Thirteen
fell for your game.

38:54.249 --> 38:57.366
You'll poison them
just like you poisoned Chase.

38:58.419 --> 39:02.253
Your husband killed
a patient and you're
breaking up with me?

39:03.842 --> 39:05.378
You ruined him,

39:08.721 --> 39:11.428
so he can't even see
right from wrong,

39:12.684 --> 39:16.051
can't even see the sanctity
of a human life any more.

39:20.900 --> 39:24.438
I loved you,
and I loved Chase.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.646
I'm sorry for you both,

39:30.034 --> 39:32.241
for who you've
become because

39:34.622 --> 39:37.238
there's no way back
for either of you.

40:39.354 --> 40:40.764
(DOOR OPENING)

40:42.231 --> 40:46.565
Any idea where I can get
a great big "Mission
Accomplished" banner?

40:48.863 --> 40:53.357
Got my sanity back,
my license back,
and now...

40:55.036 --> 40:57.197
You're kidding.
All of them?

40:57.288 --> 40:58.949
Three out of four,

40:59.040 --> 41:01.622
which is almost as good
as four out of five.

41:01.709 --> 41:03.916
Who was the...
Cameron.

41:04.003 --> 41:06.619
Wow. I can't believe it.

41:06.714 --> 41:11.549
I mean, really.
I can't believe it.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.887
You were right, House.
Good for you.

41:17.558 --> 41:19.059
Yeah. It is.

41:21.646 --> 41:25.980
She's broken up with Chase,
and she's leaving
the hospital. Still,

41:26.609 --> 41:28.850
three out of four
ain't bad.
