00:11.844 --> 00:14.346
You can run,
but you can't fly!

00:15.848 --> 00:16.982
I don't need to.

00:18.351 --> 00:19.484
Really?

00:21.988 --> 00:23.255
(grunts)

00:25.959 --> 00:27.326
(grunting)

00:31.397 --> 00:32.564
(grunting)

00:32.566 --> 00:33.665
Give up? (grunts)

00:33.667 --> 00:35.334
Captain america: Do you?

00:47.513 --> 00:49.781
Iron man:
We don't actually need
to see you're scattered atoms

00:49.783 --> 00:51.250
To prove my point.

00:52.452 --> 00:54.987
The point being
your video game
has some nice graphics?

00:54.989 --> 00:56.255
Sure.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.923
Flattery won't
get you un-atomized.

00:58.958 --> 01:01.326
You want to survive,
you got to change
with the times.

01:01.761 --> 01:03.762
Spend a few decades
frozen in ice,

01:03.764 --> 01:05.030
Then we can talk
about survival.

01:05.032 --> 01:08.000
Jarvis:
<i>Sir, I believe you</i>
<i>would call that a burn.</i>

01:08.501 --> 01:11.036
Point to jarvis,
master of the obvious.

01:11.471 --> 01:13.305
I've already designed
new armor for you, cap,

01:13.773 --> 01:15.374
Plus an upgrade
to the shield.

01:15.708 --> 01:17.676
Don't worry,
I kept the color scheme.

01:17.810 --> 01:19.611
Tony, armor would
slow me down

01:19.613 --> 01:21.847
And my shield is like
an extension of my arm.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.048
If you change it
in any way...

01:23.050 --> 01:24.383
Just say it.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.385
Say, "tony,
I'm afraid of new tech."

01:26.387 --> 01:28.854
Admitting you have
a problem is always
the first step.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.322
Gosh, mr. Big brain,

01:30.324 --> 01:32.658
Your modern tech
is so gol-darn
confusing.

01:33.493 --> 01:35.894
How does this contraption
turn water into coffee?

01:35.896 --> 01:39.298
Is it coal power,
or is it a miracle?

01:39.766 --> 01:42.467
Hmm. Sarcasm must be
a modern invention

01:42.469 --> 01:45.604
Because when you do it,
it just sounds wrong.

01:45.838 --> 01:49.041
Say, if I hit this,
will the whole building
just launch into the sky?

01:49.342 --> 01:51.743
Uh, the aven-jet? Yes.

01:51.944 --> 01:53.612
I know,
I read the manual.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.747
I don't have
a problem
with technology.

01:55.749 --> 01:58.016
But no machine
can replace
human intuition

01:58.451 --> 02:00.052
Or just plain guts.

02:00.054 --> 02:01.653
You're saying
I don't have guts?

02:01.655 --> 02:03.355
Jarvis:
<i>Sir, there's a broadcast</i>

02:03.357 --> 02:04.856
<i>I suggest you watch.</i>

02:05.058 --> 02:07.092
On your newfangled
magic picture box?

02:07.527 --> 02:08.727
Enough.

02:09.762 --> 02:11.330
<i>You call them "avengers"?</i>

02:11.531 --> 02:13.332
<i>I call them</i>
<i>loose cannons.</i>

02:13.566 --> 02:14.633
(growls)

02:14.635 --> 02:16.435
<i>Hammer tech offers better,</i>

02:16.437 --> 02:18.837
<i>Safer high-tech</i>
<i>protection from evil,</i>

02:18.839 --> 02:22.574
<i>Without the unbearable</i>
<i>ego of tony</i>
<i>"the phony" stark.</i>

02:22.975 --> 02:24.943
<i>Avengers,</i>
<i>I challenge you.</i>

02:24.945 --> 02:26.511
<i>Come on down</i>
<i>and see for yourself</i>

02:26.513 --> 02:29.114
<i>That I can do a better job</i>
<i>of hero-ing than you can.</i>

02:29.116 --> 02:29.114
<i>I'm justin hammer,</i>

02:29.116 --> 02:31.917
<i>And I approve</i>
<i>telling the avengers</i>

02:31.919 --> 02:33.852
<i>To stuff it</i>
<i>for a safer america.</i>

02:34.087 --> 02:35.587
Someone doesn't
like you.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.489
A lot of people
don't like me.

02:37.724 --> 02:40.492
None of them
are as annoying
as justin hammer.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.694
Jarvis, get me
coordinates and
call the gang.

02:49.135 --> 02:51.536
Iron man:
Hammer's a wannabe.
Smart-ish.

02:51.804 --> 02:53.605
He's a weapons tech guy,
like I am.

02:53.806 --> 02:56.608
Only he's got no skill,
talent, or tact.

02:56.776 --> 02:58.610
Captain america:
Since when
do you have tact?

02:58.612 --> 02:59.911
Why are we
taking his bait?

03:00.079 --> 03:00.078
Because on
the off chance

03:00.080 --> 03:03.081
He really did build
something dangerous,

03:03.083 --> 03:03.081
We don't want
a guy like hammer

03:03.083 --> 03:06.852
Running around
with an atomic bomb
in his pocket.

03:07.086 --> 03:08.887
And he called you
out on tv.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.055
And that.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.725
You accepted
my invitation.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.961
Mango iced tea?
I made it myself.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.130
Whatever sad, little game
you're playing, hammer,

03:18.132 --> 03:21.433
Let's get it over with
so I can get back to
something more meaningful.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.135
Like anything.

03:23.569 --> 03:25.737
I just wanted to run
a little experiment.

03:25.972 --> 03:29.141
The avengers
against one of my
humble inventions.

03:29.942 --> 03:32.177
Seriously?
What could possibly...

03:33.646 --> 03:34.880
(yells)

03:36.115 --> 03:37.749
(hulk growling)

03:40.019 --> 03:41.119
Huh?

03:41.754 --> 03:43.555
Meet the super-adaptoid,

03:43.557 --> 03:45.056
Superhero of the future.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.993
It's time to put
your metal where
your mouth is,

03:48.161 --> 03:49.561
Iron man.

04:03.876 --> 04:05.010
Iron man: Wow!

04:05.012 --> 04:06.878
You invented
a sucker punch machine.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.046
Congrats!

04:08.548 --> 04:09.815
Oh, he's a lot
more than that.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.750
Go on,
take a whack at him.

04:19.058 --> 04:20.225
(iron man groaning)

04:20.827 --> 04:21.892
(grunts)

04:24.564 --> 04:26.665
Hawkeye: Guys, come on!
Came all the way out here,

04:26.667 --> 04:28.767
Let's at least
enjoy the show
for a few seconds.

04:29.469 --> 04:30.702
Maybe stark
will get punched again.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.704
Thanks for
the support,
hawkeye.

04:33.105 --> 04:34.239
You're the best.

04:35.141 --> 04:37.742
Hammer's toy robot
packs a wallop, barely.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.846
Oh, look,
it's scanning us
for weaknesses.

04:41.481 --> 04:43.215
That is adorable.

04:43.549 --> 04:45.684
Captain america:
Don't get cocky...
Cockier.

04:45.686 --> 04:45.684
It's learning.

04:45.686 --> 04:48.086
Then let's take it
to school.

04:58.498 --> 04:59.564
I give him an f.

04:59.566 --> 05:00.632
Whoa.

05:06.672 --> 05:07.806
F-minus.

05:07.808 --> 05:12.244
Thor: In asgard, we do not
have a grading system
such as this.

05:12.246 --> 05:13.812
But I will
play along.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.981
I give him a g!

05:18.818 --> 05:20.151
(grunts)

05:20.153 --> 05:21.586
Hulk: Make that an h.

05:21.588 --> 05:24.689
Next time,
school's out,
then bam.

05:24.691 --> 05:25.790
Work for you?

05:25.792 --> 05:27.859
Ah-ha!
I see what
you did there.

05:28.628 --> 05:30.028
You ruined my only model!

05:30.030 --> 05:31.696
It'll take me forever
to build another.

05:32.164 --> 05:34.833
Next time you build
something to
attack us with...

05:34.835 --> 05:36.067
Don't.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.235
(gulps)

05:39.205 --> 05:40.805
Can't blame a guy
for trying.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.674
Actually, we can.

05:42.808 --> 05:43.942
Stay out of the
weapons game

05:43.944 --> 05:45.644
Before you hurt someone.

05:46.812 --> 05:48.246
It's never that easy.

05:48.948 --> 05:51.082
I'm going to sue!
That'll teach you!

05:51.084 --> 05:52.684
Lawyer up, blue boy!

05:52.686 --> 05:54.185
Because I'm going
to sue you all!

05:54.654 --> 05:56.087
My ride is leaving.

06:00.192 --> 06:03.662
That was exceptional.

06:04.263 --> 06:06.698
You're sure you're
getting all this?
(robots beep)

06:06.700 --> 06:09.067
'cause we're ready
for phase two.

06:09.602 --> 06:12.170
Hawkeye:
A super-adaptoid
that can't adapt?

06:12.572 --> 06:14.773
Hammer should've
called it stupor-adaptoid.

06:18.611 --> 06:19.911
Oh, why so blue,
big green?

06:19.913 --> 06:21.146
He hardly got
to smash anything

06:21.148 --> 06:22.647
Besides hammer's
junk bot.

06:22.982 --> 06:25.150
Left a 10 gallon
tub of peanut butter

06:25.152 --> 06:26.651
For this stupid mission.

06:27.286 --> 06:28.687
Better still be there.

06:30.189 --> 06:32.691
What did you scan
from the adaptoid
during the battle?

06:32.892 --> 06:34.893
I scanned it
being crushed
to bits. Why?

06:35.294 --> 06:36.895
I'd just like
to see the data,
that's all.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.663
You said it was
scanning us?

06:38.798 --> 06:40.098
There's nothing to see.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.700
<i>Nada, </i> zip, zero.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.702
Hammer came at us
with his cheesy robot.

06:43.704 --> 06:43.702
We tore it apart.

06:43.704 --> 06:47.672
That "cheesy robot"
started to adapting
to your fighting style

06:47.873 --> 06:50.141
And was about
to use falcon's
weapons against him.

06:50.376 --> 06:53.144
And don't you think it's
strange to spend billions
on a robot

06:53.146 --> 06:54.713
Just to let us crush it?

06:54.914 --> 06:56.715
Hammer can't be
a complete idiot.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.283
Oh, hammer
is a complete idiot.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.620
Really. He's just
a geek with armor envy.

07:01.854 --> 07:03.054
Data, please.

07:04.123 --> 07:06.858
Not my idea of a good time,
but knock yourself out.

07:10.229 --> 07:13.398
If any of the math
looks complicated,
that's because it is.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.705
I can do this.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.240
(computer whirring)

07:24.810 --> 07:25.910
(sighs)

07:26.045 --> 07:27.646
If you just say,
"I meant to do that,"

07:27.648 --> 07:29.147
It pretty much
covers everything.

07:29.715 --> 07:30.749
(chuckles) thanks.

07:30.751 --> 07:30.749
I don't want
to overstep,

07:30.751 --> 07:34.786
But if you need
help with the tech,
just ask.

07:35.221 --> 07:38.823
Probably sort of
challenging for
someone of your age.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.892
Sam, I'm barely
older than you.

07:41.427 --> 07:44.162
I slept through a lot,
but I woke up
to a world of marvels.

07:44.664 --> 07:46.698
I really think
this stuff is the tops.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.433
Cool. But just
so you know,

07:48.435 --> 07:49.901
Nobody says
"the tops" anymore.

07:50.703 --> 07:50.702
What are you
looking for anyway?

07:50.704 --> 07:54.305
Hammer played
right into one
of stark's blind spots.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.007
He threw
a machine at tony.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.710
And stark believes
he's master
of all machines.

07:58.911 --> 07:59.978
Right there.

08:00.146 --> 08:00.145
Whoa.

08:00.147 --> 08:03.248
Those are
undifferentiated
micro-clusters.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.884
Tiny machines...
That can be
repurposed in response

08:05.886 --> 08:07.318
To new programing,
right?

08:09.088 --> 08:11.022
Futura.
Never miss an issue.

08:11.290 --> 08:14.392
Tony thought the adaptoid
was scanning us
for weaknesses.

08:14.394 --> 08:16.695
But it can do
more than that.
Better call him.

08:17.329 --> 08:18.730
(both groaning)

08:23.302 --> 08:26.071
Hammer: (on speakers)
<i>gentlemen, you left so soon.</i>

08:26.073 --> 08:27.939
<i>Our little test</i>
<i>wasn't over.</i>

08:28.174 --> 08:30.909
<i>See, first</i>
<i>super-adaptoid learns,</i>

08:30.911 --> 08:33.078
<i>Then he adapts.</i>
<i>Capisce?</i>

08:33.446 --> 08:36.448
He hit me with
a repulsor blast
just like yours.

08:36.450 --> 08:36.448
What is this?

08:36.450 --> 08:40.284
Iron man:
Don't quote me on this,
but, uh,

08:40.287 --> 08:41.419
I've got no idea.

08:41.421 --> 08:43.855
<i>Soil your armor yet,</i>
<i>stark?</i>

08:43.857 --> 08:46.157
Captain america:
Hammer's machine wasn't
scanning us for weakness.

08:46.159 --> 08:46.157
It was learning.
I got it, cap!

08:46.159 --> 08:49.861
<i>When was the last time</i>
<i>you tasted uni-beam, stark?</i>

08:52.098 --> 08:53.198
Taste this.

08:54.266 --> 08:55.333
(grunting)
(grunting)

08:55.335 --> 08:56.768
<i>Stuff it, stark.</i>

08:58.838 --> 09:00.038
Iron man!

09:04.944 --> 09:06.778
No one uni-beams me!

09:06.946 --> 09:08.113
That's not
going to work!

09:11.784 --> 09:11.783
(iron man screaming)

09:11.785 --> 09:14.452
<i>You should listen</i>
<i>to your team.</i>

09:15.187 --> 09:16.988
You still
don't get it.

09:17.757 --> 09:18.857
(grunts)

09:20.893 --> 09:22.193
<i>Smooth.</i>

09:22.195 --> 09:22.193
<i>I'll have to</i>
<i>remember that one.</i>

09:22.195 --> 09:25.930
<i>The beauty part</i>
<i>is recalling</i>
<i>you're every move,</i>

09:25.932 --> 09:27.198
<i>Shouldn't be a problem.</i>

09:27.200 --> 09:28.800
<i>I feel like</i>
<i>causing trouble.</i>

09:28.802 --> 09:30.168
<i>You feel like</i>
<i>stopping me?</i>

09:33.105 --> 09:34.939
Gonna listen
to me now?
You bet.

09:35.174 --> 09:36.341
Soon as I
remind hammer

09:36.343 --> 09:38.076
That anything
he can build,

09:38.078 --> 09:39.210
I can break.

09:40.045 --> 09:41.279
Captain america:
Tony!

09:42.047 --> 09:43.414
Don't worry,
I got him.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.883
(grunting)

09:46.485 --> 09:48.453
This doesn't look
anything like listening.

09:51.891 --> 09:53.424
I hate robots.

09:53.826 --> 09:56.327
Aye. Shall we begin
the smashing, then?

09:56.329 --> 09:57.395
(grunts)

09:57.397 --> 09:58.463
(roaring)

10:01.100 --> 10:02.167
(both yelling)

10:08.941 --> 10:12.243
As adaptoid is hit
with new weapons,
energy, or powers,

10:12.245 --> 10:14.379
It can copy them
by creating new devices,

10:14.381 --> 10:16.214
New weapons
and new tactics.

10:16.816 --> 10:18.049
Like that one.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.317
Iron man:
What's the game,
hammer?

10:19.319 --> 10:21.586
You don't get to be
superhero of the future

10:21.588 --> 10:24.122
By attacking us
over new york city.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.258
<i>True. Maybe that</i>
<i>was a little fib</i>
<i>on my part.</i>

10:27.260 --> 10:30.061
<i>Maybe I have bigger</i>
<i>plans for the adaptoid.</i>

10:30.063 --> 10:33.031
<i>And I bet you just wish</i>
<i>you knew what they were.</i>

10:37.236 --> 10:39.237
Well, that wasn't
ominous at all.

10:41.207 --> 10:41.206
Hmm...

10:43.542 --> 10:45.944
Turbines approximating
falcon's speed,

10:46.111 --> 10:47.412
My repulsor tech,

10:47.414 --> 10:49.881
Hulk's excess density
and strength,

10:50.015 --> 10:52.083
Cap's shield,
obviously...

10:52.085 --> 10:53.985
How did you
figure it out, sam?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.286
I didn't.
It was cap.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.422
Cap? I hate it
when he's right...

10:58.123 --> 10:59.958
Especially when it means
I'm wrong.

11:00.893 --> 11:02.360
Thor: Go back
to school, robot.

11:03.095 --> 11:04.362
(gasping)

11:04.364 --> 11:05.864
(grunts)
(groaning)

11:07.266 --> 11:08.366
(roaring)

11:17.243 --> 11:18.142
(laughs)

11:18.144 --> 11:20.044
That was a good jest, yes?

11:20.046 --> 11:21.212
Just light it up.

11:34.593 --> 11:36.427
Hammer:  <i>It's not going</i>
<i>to be that easy!</i>

11:39.098 --> 11:40.965
Ha! We were
not finished!

11:43.235 --> 11:45.203
Ready up, avengers.
This isn't over yet.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.304
I have
a strategy...

11:46.306 --> 11:47.505
We're all good, cap.

11:47.940 --> 11:50.074
That thing just took
a face full of hulk

11:50.076 --> 11:52.410
And kajillion volts
of asgardian lighting.

11:52.678 --> 11:52.677
It's toast.

11:52.679 --> 11:57.215
Hammer:  <i>Really?</i>
<i>You're the ones</i>
<i>about to burn.</i>

12:00.920 --> 12:01.986
(grunting)

12:05.591 --> 12:05.590
Captain america:
When are you
going to learn?

12:05.592 --> 12:09.427
It's learning our moves
and mimicking our powers.

12:18.504 --> 12:20.438
We have to try
a new way
of doing things,

12:20.440 --> 12:21.639
Different than
we're used to.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.474
I'm on it!

12:23.476 --> 12:25.143
<i>Bring it on, little bird.</i>

12:29.114 --> 12:31.349
If the adaptoid
can steal what
our moves are,

12:31.351 --> 12:33.217
Then we can't be
ourselves.

12:33.219 --> 12:35.186
Ooh! I call
handsome billionaire.

12:35.188 --> 12:38.990
Hammer:  <i>You're all limited</i>
<i>by years of experience,</i>
<i>hardened into habit.</i>

12:38.992 --> 12:41.592
<i>But all my adaptoid</i>
<i>does is grow and</i>
<i>change and learn.</i>

12:43.195 --> 12:44.295
(grunting)

12:44.297 --> 12:46.364
Learning takes too long.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.498
(roaring)

12:50.235 --> 12:51.636
(screaming)

12:52.204 --> 12:53.404
(grunts)

12:53.406 --> 12:55.173
Let's try
a combined assault.

12:55.175 --> 12:58.242
If we can overwhelm him,
we can wipe that smirk
off his face.

12:58.244 --> 12:59.310
Come on!

13:01.080 --> 13:03.281
Keep it occupied!
We need better tools!

13:04.149 --> 13:05.483
Avengers, attack!

13:08.287 --> 13:11.222
<i>You don't think a</i>
<i>adaptoid can handle</i>
<i>you all at once?</i>

13:11.224 --> 13:12.623
(sonic boom)

13:12.625 --> 13:14.058
(screaming)

13:16.261 --> 13:17.528
Whoa!

13:23.068 --> 13:24.202
Hawkeye, missiles!

13:24.336 --> 13:25.737
I am all over them.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.644
<i>Good boy!</i>

13:34.046 --> 13:35.713
<i>But can you stand</i>
<i>some falcon power</i>

13:35.715 --> 13:37.482
<i>Mixed with thor</i>
<i>brand lighting?</i>

13:39.018 --> 13:40.118
Whoa!

13:40.552 --> 13:41.652
My hair!

13:43.222 --> 13:44.455
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

13:44.457 --> 13:46.624
<i>Sneak attack?</i>
<i>That will not do.</i>

13:49.395 --> 13:51.295
(grunting)

13:53.098 --> 13:54.165
(screaming)

13:58.170 --> 14:00.471
<i>All taken care</i>
<i>of except...</i>

14:00.473 --> 14:01.539
Me!

14:06.145 --> 14:07.245
<i>Zap.</i>

14:09.448 --> 14:10.548
(grunts)

14:10.550 --> 14:14.152
Hammer:  <i>Ha! Too bad</i>
<i>you don't know</i>
<i>how to adapt.</i>

14:15.187 --> 14:16.621
<i>Now, where were we?</i>

14:17.056 --> 14:20.091
<i>Time to put your metal</i>
<i>where your mouth is,</i>
<i>iron man.</i>

14:20.559 --> 14:21.826
Jarvis:
<i>System failure.</i>

14:25.297 --> 14:26.664
Hammer:  <i>Ah, tony.</i>

14:28.100 --> 14:29.734
<i>May I call you tony?</i>
<i>No.</i>

14:29.736 --> 14:31.636
Are you man enough
to admit my hardware

14:31.638 --> 14:34.806
Is bigger and much,
much better than yours?

14:35.407 --> 14:38.076
<i>Where's the famous</i>
<i>stark snark, huh?</i>

14:38.078 --> 14:39.577
<i>Finally bowing</i>
<i>to the better man?</i>

14:45.617 --> 14:47.385
(computer whirring)

14:48.554 --> 14:51.456
Here's a tip.
When you're busy
monologuing,

14:51.623 --> 14:53.624
You're not busy
noticing that
your butt's

14:53.626 --> 14:55.726
About to get beat
red, white, and blue.

14:56.261 --> 14:57.395
<i>Huh?</i>

15:01.600 --> 15:03.167
(screaming)

15:09.708 --> 15:11.776
Copycats never
get far, hammer.

15:12.344 --> 15:13.678
Hope you know
you're finished.

15:16.448 --> 15:18.749
<i>Finished?</i>
<i>Not nearly.</i>

15:19.251 --> 15:20.651
All right, new plan.

15:27.326 --> 15:28.459
(groaning)

15:28.894 --> 15:30.361
Iron man:
Everyone accounted for?

15:31.497 --> 15:32.630
Cap!

15:38.604 --> 15:40.705
<i>Run away?</i>
<i>I'm faster.</i>

15:40.707 --> 15:42.740
<i>Hide?</i>
<i>I'll find you.</i>

15:44.309 --> 15:46.844
<i>Adaptoid's mastered</i>
<i>all your tricks,</i>
<i>remember?</i>

15:47.379 --> 15:48.546
(grunts)
(laughing)

15:48.548 --> 15:49.881
<i>I don't mean</i>
<i>to hurt your feelings,</i>

15:49.883 --> 15:51.849
<i>But there wasn't much</i>
<i>to learn tech-wise</i>

15:51.851 --> 15:53.417
<i>From a relic like you.</i>

15:55.420 --> 15:56.487
(grunting)

15:56.489 --> 15:57.722
<i>Before we wrap this up,</i>

15:57.724 --> 16:00.691
<i>I want to patch in a friend</i>
<i>to enjoy this victory.</i>

16:01.193 --> 16:03.161
<i>Skull, are you getting this?</i>

16:03.595 --> 16:05.196
Figures you're not alone.

16:05.931 --> 16:07.398
Hammer:  <i>So, tell me,</i>

16:07.533 --> 16:09.567
<i>How's my audition</i>
<i>going for you so far, huh?</i>

16:09.868 --> 16:09.867
Red skull:
Impressive.

16:09.869 --> 16:12.703
But,  <i>herr </i> hammer,
I must caution you

16:12.705 --> 16:15.306
Not to underestimate
captain america.

16:15.774 --> 16:18.309
He's more formidable
than you can imagine.

16:18.443 --> 16:19.677
<i>He's puny.</i>

16:20.479 --> 16:21.646
<i>And old.</i>

16:21.648 --> 16:25.416
<i>And no match</i>
<i>for my modern</i>
<i>mechanical mayhem.</i>

16:26.785 --> 16:27.852
(grunts)

16:28.453 --> 16:29.554
<i>I am good.</i>

16:29.821 --> 16:31.189
Cornered.

16:31.657 --> 16:32.723
Just what I wanted.

16:33.192 --> 16:35.193
<i>Ha! My tech</i>
<i>was too much</i>

16:35.195 --> 16:37.328
<i>For tired old</i>
<i>captain america?</i>

16:37.629 --> 16:40.831
<i>Guess our little</i>
<i>experiment is finally over.</i>

16:41.600 --> 16:43.634
(alarm wailing)
(grunts)

16:43.636 --> 16:45.236
(captain america panting)

16:52.444 --> 16:54.278
Cap, what are you doing?

16:54.746 --> 16:56.347
<i>It's called adapting.</i>

16:56.715 --> 16:57.715
Great plan.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.785
Expect the aven-jet
has a monster-sized
hole in it,

17:00.787 --> 17:02.820
And any second
you're going
to run out of air.

17:05.656 --> 17:07.525
Um... I meant to do that.

17:10.796 --> 17:11.996
(grunting)

17:11.998 --> 17:13.531
(laughing)

17:16.435 --> 17:16.434
<i>I'm surprised at you.</i>

17:16.435 --> 17:19.604
<i>Aren't you the one</i>
<i>who keeps telling stark</i>

17:19.606 --> 17:21.305
<i>Not to use</i>
<i>the same old moves?</i>

17:21.307 --> 17:23.007
(panting)
<i>what a shame.</i>

17:27.012 --> 17:28.311
<i>Huh?</i>

17:34.286 --> 17:35.386
Iron man:
<i>Cap, hang tight.</i>

17:35.388 --> 17:36.487
We're on our way.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.788
Eta, two minutes.

17:38.657 --> 17:40.691
Okay, but just wait
for my signal.

17:40.693 --> 17:41.959
Iron man:
<i>Wait, what signal?</i>

17:42.494 --> 17:43.794
You'll know it.
Got to go.

17:47.766 --> 17:50.468
<i>You are a wily one,</i>
<i>mr. America.</i>

17:50.702 --> 17:53.738
It's captain.
And I meant for you
to catch my shield.

17:54.740 --> 17:55.673
<i>Huh?</i>

17:55.675 --> 17:56.874
(beeping)

17:57.542 --> 17:58.843
(screaming)

18:00.946 --> 18:00.945
<i>Nice touch.</i>

18:00.947 --> 18:05.016
<i>But I've already taken down</i>
<i>gods and monsters.</i>

18:05.450 --> 18:06.584
<i>You're just a man.</i>

18:06.586 --> 18:07.852
<i>So it's only</i>
<i>a matter of time.</i>

18:10.956 --> 18:12.757
<i>And still going.</i>

18:13.659 --> 18:15.059
<i>Let's face facts, cap.</i>

18:15.061 --> 18:16.460
<i>You're not going</i>
<i>to win this fight</i>

18:16.462 --> 18:16.460
<i>Because you borrowed</i>
<i>a bow and arrow.</i>

18:18.363 --> 18:19.830
Captain america:
You tech-heads
are all the same.

18:19.998 --> 18:22.633
You always forget
one simple variable.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.770
(grunting)
good old-fashioned guts.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.648
<i>Why can't I hit you?</i>

18:37.783 --> 18:41.085
You copied the moves
of the teammates
I spar with every day.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.387
Now, I know your robot
better than you do.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.757
For example,
thor always drops
his left guard.

18:47.025 --> 18:48.359
Like that!

18:48.361 --> 18:51.529
And falcon always flares
his wings whenever
he's thrown for a loop.

18:51.663 --> 18:52.730
Like that!

18:54.066 --> 18:54.932
(static)

18:58.670 --> 19:00.671
<i>Yeah? Well, maybe</i>
<i>you know them,</i>

19:00.839 --> 19:03.708
<i>But I bet you</i>
<i>don't know yourself</i>
<i>as well as you think.</i>

19:04.042 --> 19:05.576
I'll take that bet.

19:05.911 --> 19:08.379
See 90% of the time
I dodge to the right

19:08.381 --> 19:09.780
When I throw my shield.

19:09.782 --> 19:10.848
(grunting)

19:10.850 --> 19:12.717
But never in front
of a window.

19:12.719 --> 19:13.784
Huh?

19:15.754 --> 19:16.821
(grunting)

19:19.725 --> 19:21.726
(straining)

19:21.728 --> 19:24.695
That was the signal,
in case you missed it!

19:25.130 --> 19:26.831
<i>Aw, pig's feet.</i>

19:29.801 --> 19:31.769
Time to end this,
don't you think?

19:32.371 --> 19:34.038
School is out
for summer!

19:44.649 --> 19:45.950
Cap?

19:45.952 --> 19:47.718
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

19:48.453 --> 19:49.754
If you're still alive.

19:50.122 --> 19:52.123
Oh, man, I hope
you're still alive.

19:52.758 --> 19:53.824
Cap!

19:53.826 --> 19:54.892
Tony!

19:57.129 --> 19:58.863
So that was your plan?

19:58.865 --> 20:01.866
Trash the aven-jet
and shoot it into space?

20:01.868 --> 20:03.033
<i>Don't worry, tony.</i>

20:03.035 --> 20:04.802
<i>I'll lend you a book</i>
<i>on home repair.</i>

20:04.804 --> 20:07.505
<i>But wait,</i>
<i>you do know what</i>
<i>a book is, right?</i>

20:07.507 --> 20:07.505
Yeah.

20:07.507 --> 20:11.175
There are a few old-fashioned
things worth keeping around.

20:12.744 --> 20:13.911
Hammer:
<i>I deserve to be</i>
<i>in the cabal.</i>

20:13.913 --> 20:13.911
<i>Next time,</i>
<i>it'll work better.</i>

20:13.913 --> 20:18.149
<i>You got to understand,</i>
<i>this is just a minor</i>
<i>setback, okay?</i>

20:18.517 --> 20:18.516
Red skull: Indeed.

20:18.518 --> 20:22.052
But I'm afraid
your services will
not be required.

20:22.788 --> 20:24.822
<i>Aw, come on!</i>
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

20:24.824 --> 20:24.822
<i>Give me</i>
<i>another chance.</i>

20:24.824 --> 20:27.558
<i>I almost beat them.</i>
<i>I almost...</i>

20:27.560 --> 20:28.726
Imbecile.
(disconnects)

20:29.694 --> 20:33.197
But still, an imbecile
with an important tool.

20:34.032 --> 20:36.834
M.O.D.O.K, do you
have what you
need to rebuild it?

20:37.903 --> 20:41.639
Some of it.
Most of the machine
burned up on re-entry,

20:41.641 --> 20:43.874
So it's only
about 20% viable.

20:43.876 --> 20:46.577
But it's already
healing itself.

20:47.546 --> 20:50.648
Hammer failed
in his audition
for our little cabal,

20:50.650 --> 20:52.550
But his machine
did not.

20:52.984 --> 20:55.686
All it needs
is a better pilot.

20:58.657 --> 20:58.656
Iron man:
Okay, wait a second.

20:58.658 --> 21:02.059
So, explain to me again
how you memorized
all our moves

21:02.061 --> 21:04.228
Without the aid
of a single machine.

21:04.696 --> 21:05.930
You just wouldn't
understand

21:05.932 --> 21:07.932
Good old-fashioned
human ingenuity.

21:08.166 --> 21:09.767
Maybe. Maybe not.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.870
But I'd be
willing to learn.

21:13.672 --> 21:14.772
In that case.

21:19.244 --> 21:21.812
Humbled and impressed
in one day.

21:22.581 --> 21:23.881
I think I hate today.

21:24.516 --> 21:25.716
Impressed by this?

21:25.718 --> 21:26.917
It's just
a little something
I whipped up

21:26.919 --> 21:28.786
On my handy
dandy starkpad.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.721
Now, let's go
over the battle.

21:31.122 --> 21:32.556
Hold on.

21:33.058 --> 21:34.592
I want to take notes.

21:35.727 --> 21:37.094
Learning.
