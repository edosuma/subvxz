<i>My mother died of pneumonia
when I was just a kid.</i>

00:27.238 --> 00:30.821
<i>My father'd kept their wedding cake
in the freezer for 10 whole years.</i>

00:31.071 --> 00:35.785
<i>After the funeral he gave it to the
yardman. He tried to act cheerful...</i>

00:36.035 --> 00:39.788
<i>... but he could never be consoled by
the little stranger he found in his house.</i>

00:40.038 --> 00:45.132
<i>Then one day, hoping to begin a new
life away from all his memories,...</i>

00:45.382 --> 00:51.677
<i>... he moved us from Texas
to Fort Dupree, South Dakota.</i>

01:31.516 --> 01:36.400
I'll give you a dollar
to eat this collie.

01:40.193 --> 01:43.525
I ain't gonna eat him for a dollar.

01:43.776 --> 01:49.330
I don't think he's a collie either.
Some kind of dog though.

01:49.580 --> 01:52.662
Watch your head.

01:57.586 --> 02:03.891
Hey Woody! Give me a cigarette!

02:04.891 --> 02:08.434
Woody wouldn't give me a cigarette.

02:08.684 --> 02:11.066
Ever notice he don't talk much?

02:11.316 --> 02:15.479
Yeah he's not a talker.
You got that.

02:15.729 --> 02:19.823
<i>Little did I realize that what began
in the alleys and back ways...</i>

02:20.073 --> 02:25.867
<i>... of this quiet town would end
in the badlands of Montana.</i>

02:26.117 --> 02:28.289
- They won't fit.
- How do you know?

02:28.539 --> 02:30.791
- What size are they?
- Your size.

02:31.041 --> 02:32.792
- Give me a dollar.
- Nah.

02:33.042 --> 02:36.885
They cost 20 new.

02:38.256 --> 02:43.260
Why don't you see if they fit you?

02:53.238 --> 02:57.451
This lady don't ever pay her bills.

02:57.701 --> 03:03.165
She's gonna get in trouble
if she doesn't watch out.

03:10.380 --> 03:15.804
I throwed enough trash for today
Cato. I'll see you in the morning.

03:16.055 --> 03:21.519
- Catch!
- What do you mean?

04:16.540 --> 04:21.543
Hi. I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you
from anything important am I?

04:21.793 --> 04:23.085
No.

04:23.335 --> 04:30.300
Just thought I'd come over and say
hello to you. I'll try anything once.

04:31.801 --> 04:36.144
- What's your name? I said mine.
- Holly.

04:36.435 --> 04:43.360
Well Holly you... I don't know
you want to take a walk with me?

04:43.610 --> 04:47.193
- What for?
- Oh I got some stuff to say.

04:47.443 --> 04:49.534
Guess I'm kind of lucky that way.

04:49.785 --> 04:55.909
Most people don't have anything
on their minds do they?

04:56.119 --> 05:00.082
Oh incidentally
my last name is Carruthers.

05:00.332 --> 05:04.676
- Sounds too much like "druthers" huh?
- It's okay.

05:04.926 --> 05:11.971
Yeah well nobody asked me what I
thought. They just hung it on me.

05:12.221 --> 05:16.685
- You still in school?
- No I got me a job.

05:16.935 --> 05:18.566
Doing what?

05:18.816 --> 05:23.950
Well I don't mind getting up early
so I got a job throwing garbage.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.531
Holly!

05:25.781 --> 05:29.534
- I'm not in love with it.
- That's my father. I gotta run.

05:29.784 --> 05:33.667
Wait! When will I see you again?

05:34.788 --> 05:38.091
- I know what my daddy's gonna say.
- What?

05:38.341 --> 05:41.673
- Can I be honest?
- Sure.

05:41.924 --> 05:45.806
That I shouldn't be seen with
anybody that collects garbage.

05:46.057 --> 05:49.439
- He'll say that?
- Yeah.

05:49.689 --> 05:52.852
- Now what's he know about garbage?
- Nothing.

05:53.102 --> 05:54.653
There you go.

05:54.903 --> 06:01.658
I mean there's nothing
he wants to know. I gotta run.

06:06.952 --> 06:11.376
- Who was that?
- Just some boy.

06:11.626 --> 06:18.841
Is that gonna kill the grass?
You got some on my feet!

06:19.091 --> 06:20.592
What'd he want?

06:20.843 --> 06:26.687
He was just asking if we needed
any yard work done.

06:26.847 --> 06:32.651
I said no.
And for him not to bother us.

06:36.324 --> 06:38.326
Heard the news Kit?

06:38.576 --> 06:40.737
No.

06:40.998 --> 06:43.329
Been in all the headlines.

06:43.580 --> 06:45.001
What's that?

06:45.251 --> 06:50.375
You've been fired.
Ain't that a helluva note?

06:51.796 --> 06:54.378
Yeah how about that?

06:54.628 --> 07:01.223
I won't need my keys. I'll leave them
where they'll be nice and handy.

07:04.015 --> 07:07.147
I've got my dog.

07:07.527 --> 07:10.650
Have you ever held another job before?

07:10.900 --> 07:14.743
Yeah I used to throw trash
for the city.

07:14.993 --> 07:21.078
- And you lost that one?
- Yeah I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

07:21.328 --> 07:26.582
- Why did you leave?
- Just felt like it.

07:26.832 --> 07:33.387
What kind of work you think you'd be
qualified for? I just gotta get this.

07:36.849 --> 07:42.063
Well I can't think of anything
at the moment.

07:42.894 --> 07:50.400
I want you to write me out a slip
though proving I came down here.

07:50.450 --> 07:56.534
I think we can get you something
working cattle over at the pens.

07:58.456 --> 08:05.501
Yeah what the hell.
Just hope there's a breeze.

08:11.385 --> 08:18.230
<i>He was handsomer than anybody I'd met.
He looked just like James Dean.</i>

08:18.480 --> 08:22.353
- Hi.
- Well stop the world.

08:22.604 --> 08:25.486
- Hey quit my job.
- Great.

08:25.736 --> 08:27.697
Seemed like the right move.

08:27.948 --> 08:30.199
- What you doing?
- Spanish.

08:30.449 --> 08:33.371
How do you say "quit my job"
in Spanish?

08:33.621 --> 08:36.374
Something "mi trabajo".

08:36.624 --> 08:43.469
Well I'm going to work
as a cowboy now. Thinking about it.

08:43.879 --> 08:46.722
It's a routine like anything.

08:46.972 --> 08:50.725
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

08:50.975 --> 08:57.770
Yeah well at least nobody can get on
me about wearing these boots anymore.

09:02.483 --> 09:07.197
You want to go for a ride?

09:07.787 --> 09:11.080
Well I got homework.

09:11.330 --> 09:15.373
Bring it along.

09:17.715 --> 09:22.298
Somebody dropped a bag
on the sidewalk.

09:23.509 --> 09:28.263
If everybody did that
the whole town'd be a mess.

09:30.604 --> 09:33.527
Hi.

09:33.977 --> 09:37.359
- You're a redhead.
- I know.

09:37.610 --> 09:41.402
- Anybody ever call you "Red"?
- Yeah but I don't like it.

09:41.653 --> 09:47.827
- Why not?
- I just don't.

09:47.867 --> 09:52.040
- I got a headache.
- Oh yeah?

10:00.887 --> 10:05.971
- Can I come see you tomorrow?
- Okay.

10:15.648 --> 10:19.571
<i>Kit went to work in the feedlot
while I carried on with my studies.</i>

10:19.821 --> 10:21.913
<i>Little by little we fell in love.</i>

10:22.163 --> 10:23.914
<i>As I'd never been popular in school...</i>

10:24.164 --> 10:29.378
<i>... and didn't have much personality I
was surprised he took a liking to me.</i>

10:29.628 --> 10:35.513
<i>Especially when he could've had any
girl in town if he'd given it a try.</i>

10:35.763 --> 10:39.015
<i>He said that I was grand though
that he didn't want me for sex...</i>

10:39.266 --> 10:41.848
<i>... and that coming from him
this was a compliment.</i>

10:42.098 --> 10:47.062
<i>He'd never met a 15-year-old girl
who behaved more like a grownup.</i>

10:47.312 --> 10:49.153
<i>He didn't care what people thought.</i>

10:49.403 --> 10:52.195
<i>I looked good to him
and whatever I did was okay.</i>

10:52.446 --> 10:57.910
<i>If I didn't have a lot to say
that was okay too.</i>

10:58.160 --> 11:01.542
What a nice place.

11:01.793 --> 11:04.835
Yeah the tree makes it nice.

11:05.085 --> 11:07.877
And the flowers.

11:08.127 --> 11:14.262
Let's not pick them. They're so nice.

11:14.512 --> 11:18.185
It's your play.

11:19.095 --> 11:23.519
<i>Of course I had to keep this a secret
from my dad. He would've had a fit...</i>

11:23.769 --> 11:28.532
<i>... since Kit was 10 years older and
from the wrong side of the tracks.</i>

11:28.783 --> 11:33.366
<i>Our time with each other was limited.
Each lived for the precious hours...</i>

11:33.616 --> 11:37.659
<i>... when they could be with each other
away from the cares of the world.</i>

11:37.909 --> 11:41.912
My stomach's growling.

11:42.163 --> 11:45.545
There's an old Fudgsicle
you want it?

11:45.795 --> 11:47.216
No.

11:47.467 --> 11:53.931
- Somebody else is gonna get it.
- I don't care.

11:54.972 --> 11:59.015
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.

11:59.275 --> 12:04.189
<i>In the feedlot he'd remember
how I'd looked the night before.</i>

12:04.439 --> 12:09.703
<i>How I ran my hand through his hair
and traced his lips with my fingertip.</i>

12:09.953 --> 12:17.589
<i>He wanted to die with me and I dreamed
of being lost forever in his arms.</i>

12:18.210 --> 12:23.173
<i>The only thing I did wrong was
throwing out my fish when he got sick.</i>

12:23.423 --> 12:27.346
<i>Later I got a new one
but this incident kept bothering me.</i>

12:27.597 --> 12:30.929
Well he was sick.
You couldn't do much about that.

12:31.179 --> 12:34.061
- I guess not.
- So?

12:34.312 --> 12:38.605
- Well it scared me.
- I know...

12:38.855 --> 12:41.857
<i>I didn't mind telling Kit
about this stuff.</i>

12:42.107 --> 12:47.241
<i>Strange things happened to him too.
And some of what he did was strange.</i>

12:47.491 --> 12:50.744
<i>He faked his signature
whenever he used it...</i>

12:50.994 --> 12:56.798
<i>... to keep other people from forging
important papers with his name.</i>

12:58.880 --> 13:01.382
<i>And as he lay in bed
in the middle of the night...</i>

13:01.632 --> 13:05.975
<i>... he heard a noise like somebody
was holding a seashell to his ear.</i>

13:06.225 --> 13:09.808
<i>And sometimes he'd see me
in beautiful white robes...</i>

13:10.058 --> 13:15.152
<i>... and I'd put my cold hand
on his forehead.</i>

13:22.117 --> 13:25.620
Did it go the way it's supposed to?

13:25.870 --> 13:28.542
Yeah.

13:28.792 --> 13:33.666
- Is that all there is to it?
- Yeah.

13:36.548 --> 13:43.263
- What was everybody talking about?
- Don't ask me.

13:44.394 --> 13:49.228
I'm glad it's over. For a while I was
afraid I might die before it happened.

13:49.478 --> 13:52.270
Had a wreck or some deal like that.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.072
See where that tree fell in the water?

13:55.322 --> 14:00.656
Yeah. River must've washed
the roots away.

14:00.906 --> 14:04.749
You don't care about
anything I say though.

14:04.909 --> 14:06.961
- You know what I think?
- What?

14:07.211 --> 14:12.005
Let's crunch our hands with this stone.
Then we won't forget today.

14:12.255 --> 14:18.349
- But it would hurt.
- Well that's the point stupid.

14:18.469 --> 14:21.892
Don't call me stupid.

14:22.142 --> 14:27.436
Okay but I'm gonna keep it
for a souvenir.

14:27.646 --> 14:31.489
Well maybe one that's lighter.

14:41.417 --> 14:46.590
<i>Kit vowed he'd always stand beside me
and let nothing come between us.</i>

14:46.841 --> 14:51.794
<i>He wrote this out put it in a box
with some of our tokens and things...</i>

14:52.055 --> 14:56.308
<i>... and sent it off in a balloon
he'd found on the garbage route.</i>

14:56.558 --> 14:59.850
<i>His heart was filled with longing
as he watched it drift off.</i>

15:00.101 --> 15:04.484
<i>Something must've told him we'd never
live these days of happiness again...</i>

15:04.734 --> 15:08.527
<i>... that they were gone forever.</i>

15:17.203 --> 15:21.086
<i>Then sure enough Dad found out I'd
been running around behind his back.</i>

15:21.336 --> 15:23.298
<i>He was madder than I'd ever seen him.</i>

15:23.548 --> 15:30.763
<i>As punishment for deceiving him
he went and shot my dog.</i>

15:54.581 --> 15:58.204
<i>He made me take extra music
lessons after school...</i>

15:58.454 --> 16:00.756
<i>... and wait till he picked me up.</i>

16:01.006 --> 16:08.932
<i>He said if piano didn't keep me off
the streets maybe the clarinet would.</i>

16:14.646 --> 16:18.769
Sure is pretty.

16:21.031 --> 16:24.984
What'd you come out here for?

16:27.156 --> 16:31.159
I wasn't aware there was
any law against it.

16:40.295 --> 16:42.847
You know Holly?

16:43.097 --> 16:48.141
Well she means
an awful lot to me sir.

16:48.762 --> 16:54.226
Before I met her nobody could
ask me how I was doing with my girl.

16:54.476 --> 16:57.148
Matter of fact I didn't have one.

16:57.398 --> 17:00.691
Is that right?

17:09.287 --> 17:13.339
It okay me leaning on your Willys?

17:20.425 --> 17:25.019
Look I got a lot of respect
for her too sir.

17:28.892 --> 17:32.564
It's about as good a one
as I know to tell you.

17:32.815 --> 17:36.277
Well it's not good enough.

17:36.527 --> 17:40.741
What'd happen to her if she
stuck around with a guy like you Kit?

17:40.991 --> 17:43.162
She'd get along okay.

17:43.413 --> 17:47.996
And if she didn't why
she could just take off.

17:48.246 --> 17:51.499
Just take right on off
I wouldn't mind.

17:51.749 --> 17:56.843
I'd always tell people I deserved it.

18:05.269 --> 18:10.363
I don't want you hanging around
anymore. I don't wanna see you again.

18:10.613 --> 18:14.576
Understand?

18:24.793 --> 18:29.417
You something.

18:32.469 --> 18:36.973
Takes all kinds sir.

20:11.703 --> 20:13.795
Hi.

20:14.045 --> 20:17.167
What are you doing?

20:17.418 --> 20:23.882
I got a gun here sir.
Always a good idea to have one around.

20:24.053 --> 20:28.886
What do you think you're doing?

20:30.347 --> 20:33.400
Go on get out of here.

20:33.650 --> 20:37.903
I got it all planned.

20:38.613 --> 20:42.236
And I'm taking Holly off with me.

20:42.406 --> 20:48.040
Okay boy. I'm turning you over
to the authorities.

20:48.291 --> 20:53.214
- What for?
- Coming on my property with a gun.

20:54.625 --> 20:59.299
- No you're not either.
- Yeah? Why not?

20:59.549 --> 21:03.052
'Cause I can't allow it.

21:03.302 --> 21:05.393
Hey!

21:05.644 --> 21:09.517
Hey wait a minute!

21:10.187 --> 21:12.569
Suppose I shot you?

21:12.819 --> 21:16.822
How'd that be? Huh?

21:17.072 --> 21:20.405
Wanna hear how it sounds?

21:30.752 --> 21:35.046
- Kit! Kit!
- Hey where're you going?

21:42.311 --> 21:44.973
Daddy?

21:45.223 --> 21:49.066
This is Holly.

21:49.316 --> 21:54.910
Are you gonna be okay?

22:23.522 --> 22:26.564
I came in the front.

22:26.814 --> 22:29.817
How bad off is he?

22:30.067 --> 22:33.369
I can look and see.

22:33.619 --> 22:37.582
We better call the doctor.

22:38.623 --> 22:43.297
Listen I'll say how it happened.
The part I saw.

22:43.547 --> 22:48.881
Well I don't think that'd work.

22:58.648 --> 23:02.441
He don't need a doctor.

23:06.074 --> 23:11.788
- Are you sure?
- Don't believe me see for yourself.

24:02.926 --> 24:06.769
I found a toaster.

24:15.646 --> 24:19.569
Don't worry honey I'll...

24:46.689 --> 24:51.853
Listen maybe we ought to tell
somebody about this.

24:52.103 --> 24:57.067
You said that once already.
Too late now.

24:57.317 --> 24:59.578
Why?

24:59.829 --> 25:06.834
They're not going to listen to me.
You either. You kidding?

25:10.046 --> 25:14.129
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?

25:14.379 --> 25:18.132
Wouldn't be funny.

25:22.145 --> 25:27.359
Listen I'll be back after a while.

25:30.231 --> 25:38.407
Oh you wanna call the police that's
fine. Just won't be so hot for me.

26:49.951 --> 26:56.246
My girl Holly and I have decided to
kill ourselves. Same way I did her dad.

26:56.496 --> 27:01.049
Big decision huh?

27:01.169 --> 27:07.514
The reasons are obvious. I don't have
time to go into them right now.

27:07.554 --> 27:13.228
But one thing though
he was provoking me when I popped him.

27:13.478 --> 27:17.311
That's what it was like. Pop.

27:17.772 --> 27:19.523
Now we're sorry.

27:19.773 --> 27:27.409
I mean nobody's coming out of this
thing happy especially not us.

27:27.659 --> 27:35.505
I can't deny we've had fun though.
That's more than I can say for some.

27:37.667 --> 27:44.051
That's the end of the message.
I ran out of things to say.

27:44.301 --> 27:47.474
Thank you.

28:39.032 --> 28:42.115
<i>- Holly and I have decided
to kill ourselves.</i>

28:42.365 --> 28:44.326
<i>Same way I did her dad.</i>

28:44.577 --> 28:48.419
<i>Kit left the record playing over
and over for the D.A. to find.</i>

28:48.670 --> 28:53.543
<i>He was gambling for time.</i>

30:12.882 --> 30:16.645
<i>Kit made me get my books from school
so I wouldn't fall behind.</i>

30:16.895 --> 30:20.608
<i>We'd be starting fresh
and have to change our names.</i>

30:20.858 --> 30:23.570
<i>His would be James I'd be Priscilla.</i>

30:23.821 --> 30:26.323
<i>We'd hide out somewhere up north...</i>

30:26.573 --> 30:30.946
<i>... where people didn't ask
a lot of questions.</i>

30:31.196 --> 30:34.709
<i>I could've snuck out the back
or hid in the boiler room.</i>

30:34.959 --> 30:39.292
<i>But I sensed that my destiny now lay
with Kit for better or for worse.</i>

30:39.542 --> 30:43.295
<i>It was better to spend a week
with one who loved me...</i>

30:43.545 --> 30:47.258
<i>... than years of loneliness.</i>

30:48.299 --> 30:51.391
How you doing?

30:51.641 --> 30:57.106
I'm fine. Kind of tired.

30:58.527 --> 31:01.989
Yeah me too.

31:10.866 --> 31:15.329
<i>We hid out in the wilderness by a river
in a grove of cottonwoods.</i>

31:15.579 --> 31:18.171
<i>We built our house in the trees...</i>

31:18.421 --> 31:22.635
<i>... with tamarisk walls and willows
laid down to make a floor.</i>

31:22.885 --> 31:29.019
<i>There wasn't a plant in the forest
that didn't come in handy.</i>

31:46.953 --> 31:50.035
<i>We planned tunnels
under the forest floor.</i>

31:50.285 --> 31:55.209
<i>And our first task every morning
was to choose a new daily password.</i>

31:55.459 --> 31:58.922
<i>Sometimes we'd steal
a chicken or a bunch of corn...</i>

31:59.172 --> 32:02.304
<i>... or some melons from a melon patch.</i>

32:02.554 --> 32:06.387
<i>Mostly we just lay on our backs
and stared at the clouds.</i>

32:06.637 --> 32:09.349
<i>Sometimes it was like being
in a big marble hall...</i>

32:09.600 --> 32:14.814
<i>... how we talked in low voices
and heard the tiniest sound.</i>

32:27.123 --> 32:32.467
<i>They'd found only one set of bones
so we knew they'd be looking for us.</i>

32:32.717 --> 32:37.140
<i>Kit made sure we'd be prepared.</i>

32:40.092 --> 32:45.056
<i>He taught me how a gun works.
How to take it apart and rebuild it...</i>

32:45.306 --> 32:47.768
<i>... in case I had to carry on
without him.</i>

32:48.018 --> 32:53.653
<i>He said that if the devil came at me
I could shoot him with a gun.</i>

32:56.074 --> 33:01.118
<i>One day I carried 30 pounds of wood
a distance of five miles.</i>

33:01.368 --> 33:09.294
<i>Another day I covered my eyes with
makeup to see how they'd come out.</i>

33:46.462 --> 33:49.344
<i>We had our bad moments
like any couple.</i>

33:49.594 --> 33:52.637
<i>Kit accused me
of only being along for the ride...</i>

33:52.887 --> 33:58.941
<i>... while at times I wished he'd fall in
the river and drown so I could watch.</i>

33:59.182 --> 34:03.145
Take a break Red.

34:03.945 --> 34:05.816
Life of Riley huh?

34:06.067 --> 34:11.491
<i>Mostly though we got along
fine and stayed in love.</i>

34:11.741 --> 34:16.705
One of the chickens died last night.

34:30.725 --> 34:32.766
I almost stepped on him.

34:33.016 --> 34:37.560
"The "Kon-Tiki"'s motion was a little
different from what it usually was."

34:37.810 --> 34:40.693
"We had become sensitive
to the log's rhythms."

34:40.943 --> 34:46.907
"I thought of suction from the coast and
was always on deck and up the mast."

34:47.157 --> 34:49.119
He was nervous.

34:49.369 --> 34:55.083
"Time passed. At dawn just before 6
Torstein came down from the masthead."

34:55.333 --> 35:00.297
"He saw a line of small
palm-clad islands ahead."

35:16.689 --> 35:22.033
<i>I grew to love the forest. The cooing
of doves and the hum of dragonflies...</i>

35:22.284 --> 35:26.457
<i>... made it lonesome
and like everybody's dead.</i>

35:26.697 --> 35:29.159
<i>When the leaves rustled overhead...</i>

35:29.409 --> 35:36.334
<i>... it was like the spirits whispered
about the things that bothered them.</i>

35:45.261 --> 35:49.524
<i>One day while looking at some
vistas in Dad's stereopticon...</i>

35:49.774 --> 35:53.357
<i>...it hit me that I'm just a girl...
- Hi.</i>

35:53.607 --> 35:58.701
<i>... whose father was a sign painter
who had just so many years to live.</i>

35:58.951 --> 36:02.203
<i>Sent a chill down my spine
and I thought:</i>

36:02.454 --> 36:08.538
<i>Where would I be this very moment
if Kit had never met me?</i>

36:08.788 --> 36:11.500
<i>Or killed anybody?</i>

36:11.751 --> 36:14.553
<i>This very moment.</i>

36:14.803 --> 36:19.016
<i>If my mom had never met my dad.</i>

36:19.266 --> 36:22.429
<i>If she had never died.</i>

36:22.679 --> 36:26.732
<i>And what's the man
I'll marry gonna look like?</i>

36:26.982 --> 36:31.655
<i>What's he doing right this minute?
Is he thinking about me now...</i>

36:31.906 --> 36:36.159
<i>... by some coincidence
even though he doesn't know me?</i>

36:36.409 --> 36:39.872
<i>Does it show on his face?</i>

36:40.122 --> 36:45.546
<i>For days afterwards I lived in dread.
Sometimes I wished I'd fall asleep...</i>

36:45.796 --> 36:53.552
<i>... and be taken off to some magical
land but this never happened.</i>

38:11.640 --> 38:14.602
What?

38:18.485 --> 38:20.897
Get out of here! Run!

38:21.147 --> 38:24.990
Somebody's coming!

38:25.450 --> 38:28.363
Hide!

39:43.159 --> 39:46.081
Hey!

40:07.857 --> 40:11.189
Holly!

40:17.784 --> 40:22.168
Get in the car Red.

40:22.168 --> 40:26.171
We don't need this.

40:28.502 --> 40:32.005
<i>Kit felt bad about shooting
those men in the back.</i>

40:32.255 --> 40:36.598
<i>But he said they'd come in and
would've played it down and dirty.</i>

40:36.849 --> 40:42.183
<i>Besides he'd overheard them say they
were only interested in the reward.</i>

40:42.433 --> 40:45.065
<i>With lawmen
it would have been different.</i>

40:45.315 --> 40:52.110
<i>They had a job to do and deserved
a chance. But not a bounty hunter.</i>

41:25.565 --> 41:32.580
<i>We went to hide out with Kit's friend
from the days of the garbage route.</i>

41:51.725 --> 41:57.609
- How you doing Cato?
- Not bad.

42:02.363 --> 42:06.035
Take that son of a bitch.

42:17.374 --> 42:19.215
What you been doing?

42:19.465 --> 42:25.890
Running this place for a guy in town.
Nothing much to speak of.

42:26.140 --> 42:31.684
Well I don't notice us
hustling trash either.

42:32.975 --> 42:40.191
- Where'd you get them antlers?
- They come with the house.

42:42.533 --> 42:47.576
Well Cato
I want you to meet my girl.

42:47.826 --> 42:50.959
Holly Sargis.

42:51.209 --> 42:52.580
Hi.

42:52.830 --> 42:57.794
This guy at the nut house walked around
naked except for hat and gloves.

42:58.044 --> 43:01.717
And a nurse said
"You can't walk around that way."

43:01.967 --> 43:06.060
And the guy says "Well
nobody comes around here anyway."

43:06.310 --> 43:10.684
The nurse says "Well why do
you have on the hat and gloves?"

43:10.934 --> 43:15.697
And the guy says
"Well you never know."

43:22.282 --> 43:25.995
Isn't that funny?

43:26.085 --> 43:27.626
Yeah I guess.

43:27.876 --> 43:31.339
She plays clarinet too.

43:31.589 --> 43:38.384
- Don't you get bored around here?
- Well sometimes.

43:38.674 --> 43:46.060
The other day an old boy plowing
the field there found some old coins.

43:46.310 --> 43:49.102
Some old Spanish coins.

43:49.352 --> 43:54.817
- That's what he told you huh?
- Nope no he showed me one.

43:55.067 --> 43:59.830
- What'd they look like?
- Well kind of round like so. Gold.

44:00.080 --> 44:04.624
- Where at?
- Over in that field over there.

44:05.915 --> 44:08.667
I'll show you if you want.

44:08.917 --> 44:13.631
Let me finish my supper.

44:17.303 --> 44:22.477
We're thinking of going to Texas.
Holly wants to visit some people.

44:22.727 --> 44:29.192
But after that I don't know.
They say Mexico's nice.

44:29.522 --> 44:32.695
- Kit maybe I better get a shovel.
- Okay.

44:32.945 --> 44:37.288
- I'll catch up with you.
- Okay.

44:37.538 --> 44:40.621
I found a lid.
It was laying on the ground.

44:40.871 --> 44:44.964
Put that down. It's dirty.

44:55.642 --> 45:00.516
- You missed!
- You're a pissant.

45:02.147 --> 45:06.030
Hey you're throwing big ones!

45:08.692 --> 45:10.113
Cato!

45:10.363 --> 45:13.786
The shovel's in the truck.

45:55.747 --> 46:01.461
<i>Kit never let on why he shot Cato. He
said talking about it could be bad luck.</i>

46:01.711 --> 46:08.136
<i>And that right now we needed
all the luck we could get.</i>

46:08.226 --> 46:12.559
You never told me about her.

46:32.624 --> 46:36.377
Look at all this junk.

46:36.627 --> 46:40.670
How's he doing?

46:42.552 --> 46:46.895
I got him in the stomach.

46:48.396 --> 46:50.688
Is he upset?

46:50.938 --> 46:55.692
He didn't say anything to me about it.

47:11.043 --> 47:15.046
Bunch of junk.

47:23.142 --> 47:29.727
He stole that cage.
I saw him do it.

47:32.990 --> 47:35.571
Why look at that? Can't afford it.

47:35.822 --> 47:38.203
I'm just looking.

47:38.454 --> 47:44.248
Why don't you go in there and
keep him company for a while?

47:47.881 --> 47:51.884
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:52.134 --> 47:56.387
Is that your spider in there?
In that bottle?

47:56.637 --> 47:59.599
Yeah.

47:59.719 --> 48:02.732
What do you feed him?

48:02.982 --> 48:08.946
Oh flies.
Grasshoppers when I can catch them.

48:09.197 --> 48:11.869
Does he bite?

48:12.109 --> 48:15.621
He never bit me.

48:36.307 --> 48:38.809
Hi.

48:39.059 --> 48:42.311
- Hi.
- Where's Cato?

48:42.562 --> 48:44.773
- Well he's gone.
- Gone?

48:45.023 --> 48:47.315
- Yeah.
- Where?

48:47.565 --> 48:51.578
- He said not to tell.
- Oh yeah?

48:51.828 --> 48:55.831
He said for you to give us
a lift into town.

48:56.082 --> 48:59.124
You've got the Studebaker right?

48:59.374 --> 49:03.757
- I need to pick up something in there.
- I can't allow that.

49:04.008 --> 49:07.130
- What?
- If you go in I'll have to kill you.

49:07.380 --> 49:10.262
- What's going on?
- Can't take any chances.

49:10.512 --> 49:14.976
Come out of there young lady.

49:15.226 --> 49:21.521
Let's go out in this field. Come on.
Skip that. I'll keep my eye on you.

49:21.771 --> 49:25.113
- Okay.
- You don't mind?

49:27.535 --> 49:30.407
Hi.

49:30.908 --> 49:33.460
What's gonna happen to Jack and me?

49:33.710 --> 49:37.793
Have to ask Kit. He says frog I jump.

49:38.043 --> 49:40.255
Okay.

49:40.505 --> 49:44.598
- What's your friend's name?
- Jack.

49:45.388 --> 49:49.722
- You love him?
- I don't know.

49:49.972 --> 49:53.725
I gotta stick by Kit.
He feels trapped.

49:53.975 --> 50:00.320
- Yeah I can imagine.
- Well I've felt that way haven't you?

50:04.783 --> 50:08.576
Come on you two
down in the cellar.

50:08.826 --> 50:11.628
Go on.

50:13.750 --> 50:19.554
- Promise to stay there for an hour?
- Yeah.

50:19.804 --> 50:25.058
- You expect me to believe that?
- Yeah.

50:25.969 --> 50:29.642
I'm gonna shut the door.

50:35.236 --> 50:37.447
- Think I got them?
- I don't know.

50:37.698 --> 50:42.621
Well I'm not going
down there and look.

51:01.385 --> 51:07.099
<i>Suddenly I was in shock. Kit was the
most trigger-happy person I'd met.</i>

51:07.350 --> 51:13.654
<i>He claimed if you play for keeps and
the law's coming it's okay to kill.</i>

51:13.905 --> 51:20.870
<i>You had to take the consequences
though and not whine about it later.</i>

51:24.412 --> 51:28.375
<i>He'd never seemed violent before
except for once...</i>

51:28.626 --> 51:32.629
<i>... when he said he'd like
to rub out a couple of guys.</i>

51:32.879 --> 51:41.105
<i>It shows how you can know a person and
not really know him at the same time.</i>

51:43.267 --> 51:49.231
We're in for it now. If they catch us.

51:56.246 --> 51:59.789
What'd you put him in there for?

52:00.039 --> 52:05.003
Just to keep him out of the sun.

52:35.626 --> 52:39.749
<i>I didn't feel shame or fear
but just kind of blah...</i>

52:39.999 --> 52:44.132
<i>... like when you're sitting there
and the water's run out of the bathtub.</i>

52:44.382 --> 52:46.964
- You tired?
- Yeah.

52:47.214 --> 52:51.638
Yeah you look tired.

52:52.678 --> 52:57.272
When this is over I'll sit down
and buy you a big thick steak.

52:57.522 --> 53:00.314
I don't want a steak.

53:00.564 --> 53:03.607
Yeah well we'll see about that.

53:03.857 --> 53:07.910
Hey look. They're probably
gonna blame that on me too.

53:08.160 --> 53:11.162
Bastards.

53:11.412 --> 53:16.836
<i>The whole country was looking for us.
Who knew where Kit would strike next?</i>

53:17.087 --> 53:21.550
<i>Sidewalks cleared out.
Stores closed and drew their blinds.</i>

53:21.800 --> 53:26.183
<i>Posses and vigilante groups formed
from Texas to South Dakota.</i>

53:26.434 --> 53:30.056
<i>Children rode to school
under heavy guard.</i>

53:30.306 --> 53:37.062
<i>A famous detective was brought in
from Boston. He could find no clues.</i>

53:37.982 --> 53:41.275
<i>People left their lights
on while they slept.</i>

53:41.525 --> 53:46.539
<i>My clarinet teacher said I wasn't
responsible but others said I was.</i>

53:46.789 --> 53:51.202
<i>On Thursday the governor of Oklahoma
sent the National Guard...</i>

53:51.452 --> 53:57.547
<i>... to guard the Federal Reserve Bank
in Tulsa because Kit meant to rob it.</i>

53:57.797 --> 54:03.261
<i>It was like the Russians had invaded.</i>

54:16.151 --> 54:19.904
<i>We needed supplies
so we went to a rich man's house.</i>

54:20.154 --> 54:23.957
<i>Kit felt it'd be safer
and quicker than shopping.</i>

54:24.207 --> 54:25.618
<i>A maid came.</i>

54:25.868 --> 54:31.542
Hi. I'm here to check your meter.
My tools are in here.

54:31.712 --> 54:35.215
This is Holly she's from Texas.

54:35.465 --> 54:39.928
<i>Later we found out she was deaf
and we hadn't even known it.</i>

54:40.179 --> 54:43.851
Excuse me.

54:44.102 --> 54:46.313
- Hi.
- Yes?

54:46.563 --> 54:49.736
- This your place?
- Yes.

54:49.986 --> 54:54.399
Sorry to barge in on you.
Anyone else here besides you two?

54:54.649 --> 54:57.572
No.

54:58.612 --> 55:02.035
Good deal.

55:04.457 --> 55:09.961
Oh we're on the run. And...

55:10.211 --> 55:15.215
...we'd like to hang out here a while
couple hours maybe how'd that be?

55:15.465 --> 55:19.178
Stay as long as you like.

55:38.032 --> 55:44.046
Next time I ring that means
it's time to clear out.

56:26.878 --> 56:31.052
<i>I left Kit in the parlor
and went for a stroll outside.</i>

56:31.302 --> 56:34.934
<i>The day was quiet and serene
but I didn't notice...</i>

56:35.185 --> 56:42.150
<i>... for I was deep in thought and not
even thinking about how to slip off.</i>

56:49.906 --> 56:54.419
<i>The world was like a faraway planet
to which I could not return.</i>

56:54.669 --> 57:02.175
<i>I thought what a fine place it was
full of things that people can enjoy.</i>

57:02.425 --> 57:04.967
Listen to your parents and teachers.

57:05.217 --> 57:08.389
They understand things
and aren't the enemy.

57:08.640 --> 57:14.564
There's always an outside chance
you could learn something.

57:17.196 --> 57:22.610
Try to keep an open mind. Try to
understand the viewpoints of others.

57:22.860 --> 57:25.912
Consider the minority opinion...

57:26.163 --> 57:33.128
...but try to get along with the
majority of opinion once it's accepted.

57:35.169 --> 57:41.214
Of course Holly and I have had fun
even if it has been rushed.

57:41.964 --> 57:49.940
So far we're doing fine.
Hadn't got caught. Excuse the grammar.

57:56.355 --> 57:58.487
Hi.

57:58.737 --> 58:02.160
Kit's downstairs playing
with the Dictaphone.

58:02.410 --> 58:08.294
Sometimes he acts like there's
something wrong with his bean.

58:11.166 --> 58:14.469
Hope nothing ever
goes wrong with mine.

58:14.719 --> 58:16.801
You think he's crazy huh?

58:17.051 --> 58:22.555
I don't know he's kind of odd.

58:27.939 --> 58:31.441
They claim I've got him wrapped
around my finger.

58:31.692 --> 58:36.655
But I never told him to shoot anybody.

58:37.786 --> 58:41.999
- Gosh I like your house.
- Thank you.

59:01.394 --> 59:03.225
Hi.

59:03.475 --> 59:07.318
- Hi Mr. Scarborough here?
- Yeah.

59:07.568 --> 59:11.571
The thing about him
he's down with the flu. He's sick.

59:11.822 --> 59:13.613
- Really?
- Yeah.

59:13.863 --> 59:18.286
I'd invite you in but it's contagious.
Don't want an epidemic.

59:18.537 --> 59:24.421
No of course not. Only he called
last night and asked if I'd come by.

59:24.671 --> 59:29.255
Well he didn't have it last night.

59:35.099 --> 59:40.603
- What's that?
- I'd like to leave a message okay?

59:40.853 --> 59:43.775
Sure.

59:49.069 --> 59:53.283
You have to excuse me now.
I have to go back inside.

59:53.533 --> 59:56.455
Bye.

01:00:08.964 --> 01:00:13.768
Hey Tex we're out of here!

01:00:26.157 --> 01:00:29.780
- Hi! What you doing?
- Just thinking.

01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:34.493
Good a way to kill time as any.
She okay?

01:00:34.744 --> 01:00:37.205
- Yes.
- Good.

01:00:37.456 --> 01:00:41.469
We're gonna take the Cadillac
for a while. How'd that be?

01:00:41.719 --> 01:00:44.921
- Fine.
- Don't worry I won't let her drive.

01:00:45.181 --> 01:00:47.513
Oh here.

01:00:47.763 --> 01:00:50.395
A list of what I borrowed. Car too.

01:00:50.645 --> 01:00:53.858
Okay ma'am let's go. Out that way.

01:00:54.108 --> 01:00:57.060
Go on.

01:00:58.151 --> 01:00:59.482
You're my friend?

01:00:59.732 --> 01:01:04.616
- Yes.
- Okay no monkey business now.

01:01:11.411 --> 01:01:14.373
Groceries.

01:01:15.794 --> 01:01:22.509
That guy could sell that list I gave
him as a sample of my handwriting.

01:01:27.853 --> 01:01:34.108
- Why you always walking ahead of me?
- Why you always walking behind me?

01:01:34.358 --> 01:01:35.739
Don't!

01:01:35.989 --> 01:01:38.111
- Anybody ever do that to you?
- No.

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:42.744
- Positive?
- Yes.

01:01:43.535 --> 01:01:48.038
Guess there's no way
I'll ever know for sure.

01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:52.382
That guy must pay through the nose
to keep this place up.

01:01:52.632 --> 01:01:57.635
Lawn. Gas and electric. Bagworms.

01:01:57.886 --> 01:02:00.558
Plus the upkeep on the cars.

01:02:00.808 --> 01:02:05.101
You get a little money and think
your problems are solved.

01:02:05.351 --> 01:02:10.145
Well let me tell you they're not.

01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:33.843
I'd like to get out of here.

01:02:34.093 --> 01:02:38.226
Soon as I start the car.

01:02:38.476 --> 01:02:42.189
And fix my hat.

01:02:53.827 --> 01:02:59.412
<i>Fearing roadblocks on the highways
we took off across the Great Plains.</i>

01:02:59.662 --> 01:03:03.665
<i>Kit told me to enjoy the scenery
and I did.</i>

01:03:03.915 --> 01:03:08.298
"Rumor: Pat Boone's seriously
considering giving up his career...

01:03:08.548 --> 01:03:12.511
...so he can return to school
and complete his education."

01:03:12.762 --> 01:03:18.096
"Fact: Pat told intimates that so long
as things go well for his career...

01:03:18.356 --> 01:03:21.398
...it's the education that will
have to wait."

01:03:21.648 --> 01:03:22.979
I don't blame him.

01:03:23.229 --> 01:03:27.192
"Rumor: Frank Sinatra and
Rita Hayworth are in love."

01:03:27.443 --> 01:03:32.867
"Fact: True. But not with each other."

01:03:35.579 --> 01:03:38.461
Yeah.

01:03:39.752 --> 01:03:44.085
<i>Through desert and mesa
across endless miles of open range...</i>

01:03:44.335 --> 01:03:46.507
<i>... we made our headlong way...</i>

01:03:46.757 --> 01:03:53.812
<i>... steering by the telephone lines
toward the mountains of Montana.</i>

01:03:54.393 --> 01:03:59.186
<i>Kit'd sometimes ram a cow
to save ammo and we'd cook it.</i>

01:03:59.436 --> 01:04:06.742
<i>Once we had to eat a bunch of salt
grass. It tasted like cabbage.</i>

01:04:09.574 --> 01:04:14.748
<i>For gas we used the leakage from the
valves of pipelines along our way.</i>

01:04:14.998 --> 01:04:18.841
<i>"Drip gas" is what it's called
in that part of the country.</i>

01:04:19.091 --> 01:04:21.633
<i>Gradually we approached the border.</i>

01:04:21.883 --> 01:04:25.806
<i>Kit was glad to leave South Dakota
and cursed its name.</i>

01:04:26.056 --> 01:04:29.469
<i>He said that if communists
drop the atomic bomb...</i>

01:04:29.719 --> 01:04:35.143
<i>... he wished they'd put it
in the middle of Rapid City.</i>

01:04:35.353 --> 01:04:38.736
That's Montana over there.

01:04:38.986 --> 01:04:43.199
I never been to Montana.

01:04:46.452 --> 01:04:50.745
Acquaintance of mine's been there
but I hadn't.

01:04:50.995 --> 01:04:55.709
Never had any reason to.

01:04:56.169 --> 01:05:00.552
State bird's the meadowlark.

01:05:35.929 --> 01:05:39.842
<i>We lived in utter loneliness
neither here nor there.</i>

01:05:40.092 --> 01:05:45.556
<i>Kit said that solitude was a better
word more like what I wanted to say.</i>

01:05:45.806 --> 01:05:51.320
<i>Whatever the expression I told him
we couldn't go on living this way.</i>

01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:57.114
Why not? I mean I'm having fun.
At least I'm not bitchin'.

01:05:57.365 --> 01:06:02.538
I feel like an animal living out here.
There's no place to bathe and...

01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:08.043
...not any place to get
anything good to eat.

01:06:08.083 --> 01:06:14.337
Well I'll catch you a big trout
soon as we get to the mountains.

01:06:20.972 --> 01:06:23.684
Everybody loves trout.

01:06:23.934 --> 01:06:28.188
I'm serious.

01:06:38.415 --> 01:06:43.039
<i>In the distance I saw a train
making its way across the plain...</i>

01:06:43.289 --> 01:06:46.711
<i>... like the caravan in
The Adventures of Marco Polo.</i>

01:06:46.962 --> 01:06:50.464
<i>It was our first taste
of civilization in weeks...</i>

01:06:50.714 --> 01:06:56.679
<i>... and I asked Kit if we could
have a closer look.</i>

01:07:01.312 --> 01:07:05.946
<i>Before we left he shot a football
he considered excess baggage.</i>

01:07:06.196 --> 01:07:08.858
<i>Then he buried some of our things.</i>

01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:13.872
<i>He said nobody else would know where
we'd put them that we'd come back...</i>

01:07:14.122 --> 01:07:18.625
<i>... and they'd still be here
just the same but we'd be different.</i>

01:07:18.875 --> 01:07:23.419
<i>And if we never got back somebody
might dig them up years later...</i>

01:07:23.669 --> 01:07:26.591
<i>... and they'd wonder.</i>

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:08.643
We should have hopped it.

01:08:08.893 --> 01:08:11.105
It was going too fast.

01:08:11.355 --> 01:08:15.188
I could have pulled the car
on the tracks to slow it down.

01:08:15.438 --> 01:08:17.479
Then we'd be stuck here.

01:08:17.729 --> 01:08:24.154
Maybe we ought to be stuck here.
I'm not saying I know.

01:08:25.785 --> 01:08:28.618
You're crazy.

01:08:38.675 --> 01:08:46.060
<i>Kit spun the bottle leaving to fate
which direction we should take.</i>

01:08:48.973 --> 01:08:52.645
The slope throws it off
we ought to find a flat place.

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:56.488
How about over here?

01:08:59.321 --> 01:09:00.742
It doesn't matter.

01:09:00.992 --> 01:09:05.075
If I'm worth a damn
I'll pick the right direction.

01:09:05.325 --> 01:09:06.956
- See what I mean?
- No.

01:09:07.206 --> 01:09:12.130
Well I shouldn't expect
miracles should I?

01:09:20.926 --> 01:09:23.519
We'll keep heading
for that mountain.

01:09:23.769 --> 01:09:28.602
Just remember I said
it wasn't such a hot idea.

01:09:29.563 --> 01:09:33.986
<i>We took off at sunset toward
the mountains of Saskatchewan...</i>

01:09:34.237 --> 01:09:38.069
<i>... for Kit a magical land
beyond the reach of the law.</i>

01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:42.372
<i>He needed me more than ever
but something came between us.</i>

01:09:42.622 --> 01:09:44.995
<i>I stopped paying attention to him.</i>

01:09:45.245 --> 01:09:49.298
<i>I sat in the car and read a map
and spelled out sentences...</i>

01:09:49.548 --> 01:09:55.923
<i>... with my tongue on the roof of my
mouth where nobody could read them.</i>

01:09:57.764 --> 01:09:59.936
<i>We moved closer to the border.</i>

01:10:00.186 --> 01:10:03.689
<i>Across the prairie
at the edge of the horizon...</i>

01:10:03.939 --> 01:10:07.151
<i>... we saw gas fires
at the Missoula refineries.</i>

01:10:07.401 --> 01:10:10.444
<i>To the south we saw the
lights of Cheyenne...</i>

01:10:10.694 --> 01:10:15.578
<i>... a city bigger and grander
than I'd ever seen.</i>

01:10:16.288 --> 01:10:19.330
<i>I felt many things
looking at the lights.</i>

01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:23.163
<i>Most important I made up my mind
to never tag around...</i>

01:10:23.413 --> 01:10:27.296
<i>... with the hell-bent type
even if I loved him.</i>

01:10:27.546 --> 01:10:30.008
<i>I found the strength
to tell Kit this.</i>

01:10:30.258 --> 01:10:36.803
<i>I pointed out that if we got to the
North he still couldn't make a living.</i>

01:10:37.644 --> 01:10:43.108
I can get a job with the Mounties.
Northwest Mounties.

01:10:43.608 --> 01:10:46.781
I got all the qualifications.

01:10:47.031 --> 01:10:51.154
I can ride and shoot...

01:10:51.404 --> 01:10:55.748
...and I don't mind the cold.

01:10:55.998 --> 01:10:58.159
I like the cold.

01:10:58.410 --> 01:11:00.621
What?

01:11:00.871 --> 01:11:02.883
Nothing.

01:11:03.133 --> 01:11:07.847
I was just running off
at the mouth as usual.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:11.850
I'm sorry I wasn't listening.

01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:15.142
Hey man don't lip it.

01:11:15.392 --> 01:11:17.524
Well...

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:23.028
...they'd ask to see your driver's
license before they'd hire you.

01:11:23.278 --> 01:11:27.151
I'm not going to let
that stop me.

01:11:27.401 --> 01:11:32.785
- You smoke Pall Mall?
- Yeah.

01:11:33.075 --> 01:11:39.961
You haven't seen me when
I'm going after something. Tough.

01:11:41.252 --> 01:11:46.515
Hey don't touch that!
Nat King Cole!

01:12:16.998 --> 01:12:20.381
If I could sing like that...

01:12:20.631 --> 01:12:25.935
...if I could sing a song
about the way I feel right now...

01:12:26.185 --> 01:12:29.848
It would be a hit.

01:13:10.188 --> 01:13:12.029
<i>Kit knew the end was coming.</i>

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:15.032
<i>He wondered if they'd
pronounce him dead...</i>

01:13:15.282 --> 01:13:19.955
<i>... or if he'd read what the papers
would say from the other side.</i>

01:13:20.195 --> 01:13:26.290
<i>He dreaded being shot down alone
without a girl to scream his name.</i>

01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:32.084
<i>Then for an instant the sight of the
mountains at dawn got his hopes up.</i>

01:13:32.334 --> 01:13:35.467
God what a sight.

01:13:35.717 --> 01:13:37.678
Tell me this.

01:13:37.929 --> 01:13:44.353
What's a little Texas girl
like you think of that sight?

01:14:04.879 --> 01:14:09.052
Love this air.

01:14:12.054 --> 01:14:14.516
Morning.

01:14:14.766 --> 01:14:18.139
You got any gas?

01:14:18.389 --> 01:14:19.680
Maybe.

01:14:19.930 --> 01:14:23.022
I'm sorry but we got
to ask you for it.

01:14:23.273 --> 01:14:26.065
We're about out
been driving all night.

01:14:26.315 --> 01:14:28.907
I don't got time to explain.

01:14:29.157 --> 01:14:33.911
- What I got I can't spare.
- Just a second now.

01:14:34.161 --> 01:14:37.243
That's your truck isn't it?
You didn't walk here.

01:14:37.493 --> 01:14:39.875
It's mine all right.

01:14:40.125 --> 01:14:43.508
Well listen I'm gonna
swap you my Cadillac.

01:14:43.758 --> 01:14:47.881
Don't worry you're getting
a fair deal. Hell ask anybody.

01:14:48.131 --> 01:14:53.135
What's the Blue Book value
on this thing Mildred?

01:14:54.056 --> 01:14:56.187
Who are you?

01:14:56.437 --> 01:15:00.110
Carruthers. I shoot people
every now and then.

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:04.073
- Not that I deserve a medal.
- Kit.

01:15:11.288 --> 01:15:14.081
Okay friend start running.

01:15:14.331 --> 01:15:18.254
- Give me a chance!
- Go on! Get!

01:15:22.547 --> 01:15:25.839
I had a feeling today was the day.

01:15:26.089 --> 01:15:27.721
- Helicopter.
- Yeah.

01:15:27.971 --> 01:15:29.932
He's not taking us on a ride.

01:15:30.183 --> 01:15:34.816
- Let's make a run for the car.
- I don't want to.

01:15:35.066 --> 01:15:38.689
Have you got a better idea?

01:15:40.190 --> 01:15:43.402
I just don't wanna go.

01:15:44.864 --> 01:15:47.746
What?

01:16:00.675 --> 01:16:05.469
What is wrong with you?

01:16:12.434 --> 01:16:16.107
What is the matter with you?

01:16:22.822 --> 01:16:25.954
I don't know what to make
of people like you.

01:16:26.204 --> 01:16:30.037
I really don't.

01:16:35.802 --> 01:16:37.593
You want a second chance?

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:41.476
Noon Grand Coulee Dam
New Year's Day 1964. Meet me.

01:16:41.726 --> 01:16:44.938
Got that?

01:17:51.428 --> 01:17:53.800
Hey! Anybody here?

01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:56.972
Hi.

01:17:57.853 --> 01:18:01.726
You got any shells for a Savage
.300 Savage?

01:18:01.976 --> 01:18:06.399
- Nope.
- I pissed mine away shooting bottles.

01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:10.442
You wanna fill her up? Please.

01:18:44.448 --> 01:18:48.030
You want any of that junk
it's yours.

01:20:56.176 --> 01:21:00.019
<i>What was going through his head
before they got him?</i>

01:21:00.269 --> 01:21:03.391
<i>Why didn't he run while
he had the chance?</i>

01:21:03.642 --> 01:21:06.354
<i>Did he figure they'd
catch him the next day?</i>

01:21:06.604 --> 01:21:08.565
<i>Was it despair?</i>

01:21:08.816 --> 01:21:12.358
<i>Said he had a flat tire
but the way he carried on...</i>

01:21:12.608 --> 01:21:15.491
<i>... I imagine this is false.</i>

01:22:11.723 --> 01:22:13.184
Hi.

01:22:13.434 --> 01:22:15.225
Hold it right there.

01:22:15.475 --> 01:22:18.608
I could've held off an army
in the mountains.

01:22:18.858 --> 01:22:23.361
- Oh yeah?
- Long as my ammo held out.

01:22:23.611 --> 01:22:26.033
About there's where you caught me.

01:22:26.283 --> 01:22:29.696
We did it Ray.

01:22:33.499 --> 01:22:39.924
- Better not leave the car here.
- Put your hands back of your head.

01:22:40.124 --> 01:22:44.087
Now put the other one on yourself.

01:22:52.643 --> 01:22:58.477
Hell he ain't no bigger than I am.
Look at that.

01:22:59.278 --> 01:23:02.951
You're gonna give me
a cauliflowered ear.

01:23:03.191 --> 01:23:07.154
He should have thought about that
before he got caught.

01:23:07.404 --> 01:23:10.707
Shouldn't he?

01:23:25.968 --> 01:23:29.681
Think I'll take the juice?

01:23:29.721 --> 01:23:32.643
Beats me.

01:23:35.525 --> 01:23:38.607
What kind of rifle were
you shooting at me?

01:23:38.858 --> 01:23:40.239
Thirty-aught-six.

01:23:40.489 --> 01:23:45.413
- You ever opened up like that before?
- Nope.

01:23:48.455 --> 01:23:51.837
You boys performed like
a couple of heroes.

01:23:52.088 --> 01:23:57.091
Don't think I'm not gonna
pass it around in town.

01:24:07.399 --> 01:24:09.651
You tossed my hat out the window.

01:24:09.901 --> 01:24:12.363
Wanna sue me?

01:24:12.613 --> 01:24:15.195
- No.
- Kit.

01:24:15.445 --> 01:24:19.198
Kit I got a question for you.

01:24:19.618 --> 01:24:24.161
- You like people?
- They're okay.

01:24:24.832 --> 01:24:28.585
Then why'd you do it?

01:24:28.875 --> 01:24:30.376
I don't know.

01:24:30.626 --> 01:24:35.880
I wanted to be a criminal.
Just not this big of one.

01:24:36.301 --> 01:24:39.643
Takes all kinds though.

01:24:44.106 --> 01:24:47.439
You know who he looks like?

01:24:47.689 --> 01:24:50.861
- You know don't you?
- No.

01:24:51.112 --> 01:24:56.326
I'll kiss your ass if you don't
look like James Dean.

01:25:07.174 --> 01:25:08.465
How you doing?

01:25:08.715 --> 01:25:12.137
Fine as can be expected.
Just locked up can't move.

01:25:12.387 --> 01:25:16.471
- Nice coat you got on.
- You think? It's leather.

01:25:16.721 --> 01:25:20.604
Hey now look here
here's a real prize.

01:25:20.854 --> 01:25:23.856
I had this 10 years.
Who's gonna get it?

01:25:24.106 --> 01:25:25.607
- Give me that.
- There.

01:25:25.858 --> 01:25:27.189
Where you from?

01:25:27.439 --> 01:25:31.202
- South Dakota where you from?
- Here.

01:25:31.452 --> 01:25:33.363
Wanna comb?

01:25:33.613 --> 01:25:37.326
- Joni James is from South Dakota.
- She got out too.

01:25:37.576 --> 01:25:41.039
- Who's your favorite singer?
- Eddie Fisher. Yours?

01:25:41.289 --> 01:25:43.801
- Eddie Fisher.
- Damn! You want a pen?

01:25:44.051 --> 01:25:46.343
- Been to Kansas?
- How old are you?

01:25:46.593 --> 01:25:48.464
Don't you read the papers?

01:25:48.715 --> 01:25:51.387
- Been married?
- No I haven't.

01:25:51.637 --> 01:25:55.640
Hey Kit. You afraid of death?

01:25:55.890 --> 01:25:59.232
I haven't thought about it much.

01:25:59.483 --> 01:26:00.694
Say again?

01:26:00.944 --> 01:26:05.237
- Did you when you were on the move?
- Yep.

01:26:06.238 --> 01:26:08.780
I won't tell you how
to run your show...

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:12.162
...but these cuffs are pinching.
What do you say?

01:26:12.412 --> 01:26:14.584
I need to get your signature.

01:26:14.834 --> 01:26:18.417
I'll have to read them first.
Could I get a Coke?

01:26:18.667 --> 01:26:20.208
Sure thing.

01:26:20.458 --> 01:26:22.380
Come on.

01:26:22.630 --> 01:26:25.422
- Keep out of trouble.
- Don't worry about us.

01:26:25.672 --> 01:26:28.474
Holly's over here
if you want to see her.

01:26:28.725 --> 01:26:32.347
Sure.

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:39.362
I gave him the papers.
I don't want him in trouble...

01:26:39.613 --> 01:26:44.076
You wanna give me
a little slack here?

01:26:47.619 --> 01:26:51.161
Hi.

01:26:56.665 --> 01:26:59.467
Don't worry.
I'll get you off the charges.

01:26:59.718 --> 01:27:07.013
There are other boys out there waiting
for you. You're gonna have fun.

01:27:10.556 --> 01:27:15.149
Boy we rang the bell didn't we?

01:27:15.610 --> 01:27:18.191
I'll say this though.

01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:25.867
That guy with the deaf maid
he's just lucky he's not dead too.

01:27:30.421 --> 01:27:34.714
Of course too bad about your dad.

01:27:34.964 --> 01:27:37.096
Yeah.

01:27:37.346 --> 01:27:42.430
We're gonna have to talk
about that sometime.

01:28:34.699 --> 01:28:36.570
There you go Tom.

01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:40.953
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much Chief Sims.

01:28:41.204 --> 01:28:44.046
- Sorry.
- You didn't cause me any trouble.

01:28:44.296 --> 01:28:46.668
Thanks anyway.

01:28:46.918 --> 01:28:49.840
Well...

01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:51.211
- Kit.
- Tom.

01:28:51.471 --> 01:28:52.552
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:28:52.802 --> 01:28:55.304
- I mean it.
- I know you do. You too.

01:28:55.554 --> 01:28:59.437
- Now we go.
- Okay. Thank you.

01:28:59.687 --> 01:29:02.730
Come on Red.

01:29:19.252 --> 01:29:21.664
<i>They took us back to South Dakota.</i>

01:29:21.914 --> 01:29:26.547
<i>They kept him in solitary so he
didn't get to know other inmates.</i>

01:29:26.798 --> 01:29:30.220
<i>He knew they'd like him
especially the murderers.</i>

01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:34.513
<i>Myself I got off with probation
and a lot of nasty looks.</i>

01:29:34.764 --> 01:29:40.528
<i>Later I married the son of the lawyer
who defended me.</i>

01:29:40.568 --> 01:29:43.980
<i>Kit slept in court
while his confession was read.</i>

01:29:44.231 --> 01:29:46.782
<i>He was sentenced to die
in the electric chair.</i>

01:29:47.033 --> 01:29:50.035
<i>On a warm spring night
six months later...</i>

01:29:50.285 --> 01:29:56.250
<i>... after donating his body to science
he did.</i>

01:29:58.041 --> 01:30:04.256
- Sir? Where'd you get that hat?
- State.

01:30:04.506 --> 01:30:07.888
Boy I'd like to buy me one of them.

01:30:08.138 --> 01:30:12.642
You're quite an individual Kit.

01:30:15.564 --> 01:30:20.448
Think they'll take that
into consideration?

01:30:21.305 --> 01:30:27.474
