WEBVTT

00:29.233 --> 00:30.400
-Wake up.

00:38.266 --> 00:40.066
Won't you wake up?

00:41.633 --> 00:43.000
Listen.

00:45.500 --> 00:46.734
Please.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.266
Come on.

01:08.066 --> 01:09.333
-Fuck. Fuck.

01:09.367 --> 01:12.400
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

01:12.433 --> 01:14.300
Sorry, I didn't see you. I...

01:16.600 --> 01:21.567
Sorry. I'm late for work,
and I'm in a hurry.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.066
- Sorry, I have
no idea what you are saying,

01:24.100 --> 01:26.033
or what's going on here.

01:26.066 --> 01:29.533
Oh, sorry. I was just...

01:29.567 --> 01:31.400
I was just saying that
I'm sorry,

01:31.433 --> 01:33.633
and I'm late
for this work thing,

01:33.667 --> 01:35.567
and I don't know where it is,
so I'm a bit...

01:35.600 --> 01:37.400
-Oh! Does it have to do
with that

01:37.433 --> 01:39.166
distressed-looking
group of children?

01:41.567 --> 01:42.767
-Yup, that's it.

01:44.133 --> 01:47.667
I'm... I'm sorry.
Sorry again.

01:48.633 --> 01:50.266
-WOMAN ON P.A. SYSTEM:
TV's own Elf Princess Carla

01:50.300 --> 01:54.300
will be reading aloud
in a moment.

01:54.333 --> 01:57.600
-Hello, everybody.
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:57.633 --> 02:01.500
Are you ready to go on
some Christmas adventures

02:01.533 --> 02:03.200
with the Elf Princess Carla?

02:15.467 --> 02:20.400
He pulled out his big Christmas
bazooka and shot them all.

02:21.300 --> 02:26.000
"Ouch, my arm!"
And then they all died.

02:29.467 --> 02:31.667
But they were tired
and needed a break,

02:31.700 --> 02:33.200
so we'll have one, too.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.300
-Hi.
-I was going to give you this.

02:50.333 --> 02:53.433
But now I see you're some
big important celebrity,

02:53.467 --> 02:55.200
I'm afraid I'm just going
to have to keep it.

02:55.233 --> 02:56.500
-Yeah.
-You'll have to get your own.

02:56.533 --> 02:57.734
-They don't sell them anymore.

02:57.767 --> 02:59.667
It's very old.
Like, very old.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.300
-Well, that only makes it
all the more valuable.

03:01.333 --> 03:02.700
-Right?
-Yeah.

03:04.633 --> 03:06.533
-There you go.
-There you go.

03:06.567 --> 03:08.333
-Sorry about the mix-up.
-No, no, I was the one...

03:08.367 --> 03:09.700
Please don't go.

03:09.734 --> 03:13.000
Sorry. Just...

03:13.033 --> 03:15.166
Sorry, I was...

03:15.200 --> 03:18.333
Yeah, I was just wondering,
if maybe you...

03:18.367 --> 03:21.467
If you want to go for a drink,
and then, you know,

03:21.500 --> 03:26.467
maybe you can
have my autograph if you want.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.700
-I don't understand.

03:28.734 --> 03:30.600
Surely, you can just give me
your autograph here.

03:30.633 --> 03:32.800
We don't have to go for a drink
for that, do we?

03:33.000 --> 03:34.500
-Oh, right. Yeah, of course...

03:34.533 --> 03:36.066
No, it was just that,
I think...

03:36.100 --> 03:37.567
-I'm just taking the piss.

03:39.633 --> 03:42.367
-Sorry... Okay.
-Yeah, okay. Yeah.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.433
-Like, right now?
-Yeah.

03:44.467 --> 03:48.467
-Well, it's actually 11:00 a.m.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.066
A bit early for a drink. Tea?
-Yes, too early.

03:50.100 --> 03:51.400
Tea is fine. I love tea!

03:51.433 --> 03:54.033
So I know that I have
some tea somewhere.

03:54.066 --> 03:55.367
I just...

03:58.700 --> 04:00.467
I... Oh, there it is.

04:03.300 --> 04:06.400
There's all these
different fruits.

04:07.734 --> 04:09.100
-Great.
-What would you like?

04:09.133 --> 04:11.033
-Uhh...
-Strawberry?

04:11.066 --> 04:12.533
-And I decided I wanted to do

04:12.567 --> 04:15.066
some field work abroad
for my thesis.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.533
And I had never actually been
to Denmark,

04:16.567 --> 04:19.166
which is really weird,
'cause my mum is Danish.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.333
So, I came here,
did a bit of research,

04:21.367 --> 04:23.767
and I go home
in a couple of days.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.700
That's why I'm here.

04:31.600 --> 04:35.500
Am I talking too much?
-No. It's nice hearing you talk.

04:43.233 --> 04:46.000
No, it was like
a Christmas TV show.

04:46.033 --> 04:47.800
-So you don't really
act anymore?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.200
-No, not really, no.

04:50.233 --> 04:55.433
Only like that kind of stuff...
Like the...

04:55.467 --> 04:58.100
Like elf stuff.

04:58.133 --> 04:59.767
-So, what do you do
for your rent?

04:59.800 --> 05:02.266
-Nothing, actually.
It's my mum's place.

05:02.300 --> 05:06.033
-You live with your mum, too?
-What? No.

05:06.066 --> 05:08.100
No, no, no.
She's... She's dead.

05:08.133 --> 05:12.066
-Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
-No, no, no. She got divorced.

05:12.100 --> 05:14.000
Then she got really sick.
Then she died.

05:14.033 --> 05:15.600
And now it's my place.

05:15.633 --> 05:18.734
Which is... nice.

05:18.767 --> 05:20.433
Wait. You live with your mum?

05:20.467 --> 05:23.133
-Oh. Umm...

05:23.166 --> 05:24.500
Yeah, back in London.

05:24.533 --> 05:28.333
Like, in separate flats,
just in the same house.

05:28.367 --> 05:29.600
It's not weird.

05:29.633 --> 05:33.033
-It doesn't sound weird at all,
actually.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.567
It sounds really nice.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.133
-So, what? Does that make me
Queen of Christmas?

05:36.166 --> 05:37.600
-No, you're like
the Elf Princess.

05:37.633 --> 05:39.233
-Too much responsibility for me.

05:39.266 --> 05:41.767
-It's your goodbye present.
This is yours forever.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.333
-Take it, please.
-No, I can't.

07:12.767 --> 07:14.166
Hey?

07:18.600 --> 07:20.000
Fuck!

07:36.500 --> 07:40.533
-What? What's happening?
-Sorry.

07:40.567 --> 07:42.033
-What? What happened?

07:42.066 --> 07:44.133
-I think you might
have been sleepwalking.

07:44.166 --> 07:47.100
-Oh, no. Did I do something
embarrassing?

07:47.133 --> 07:49.433
Like pee or eat something weird?

07:49.467 --> 07:53.000
-No, no, you just stood there.

07:58.433 --> 08:00.467
-What's that smell?
-Oh, I'm making you bacon.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.033
-I can't eat that.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.333
-No, no, it's fine.

08:06.367 --> 08:07.600
-Sorry, I didn't realize you
were religious.

08:07.633 --> 08:09.000
-I'm really sorry.
-No, I'm not. It's fine.

08:09.033 --> 08:10.266
And I'm not.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.033
It's just that some things
stick, you know.

08:12.066 --> 08:15.166
Because my dad was like super
religious before he left my mom.

08:15.200 --> 08:19.200
Like... Haredi, you know.
Ultra-Orthodox.

08:19.233 --> 08:22.000
-Oh. Wow. Okay. But...

08:22.033 --> 08:24.400
So your mum isn't?
-Uhh...

08:24.433 --> 08:26.734
Yeah, it's kind of a long story.

08:26.767 --> 08:29.700
-Do you want me to make you
some eggs instead?

08:29.734 --> 08:31.667
Right. Good.

08:33.533 --> 08:38.200
-Wait. First, can you just bring
a piece of that over here?

08:38.233 --> 08:39.633
-This?
-Mm-hmm.

08:39.667 --> 08:40.667
-Okay.

08:43.533 --> 08:45.133
-Mmm.

08:51.233 --> 08:53.000
-Krolle?
-That's curls.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.767
-That just sounds like you
coughed and it's gone wrong.

08:54.800 --> 08:58.433
-You know what?
I think you're really jealous

08:58.467 --> 09:01.200
that I know Danish,
and you don't know any Danish.

09:01.233 --> 09:02.467
-Sure.

09:05.700 --> 09:09.734
-And this is halskaede.

09:09.767 --> 09:11.500
-No.
-That's it.

09:11.533 --> 09:13.500
It's a very beautiful necklace.

09:13.533 --> 09:16.667
-Yeah, it's actually...

09:16.700 --> 09:19.000
My mum gave it to me
when I was a kid.

09:19.033 --> 09:23.100
Yeah, it's an amulet.
Jewish superstition thing.

09:23.133 --> 09:26.367
It's supposed to protect me
from disease, apparently.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.433
-Great.
-Yeah.

09:28.467 --> 09:29.800
I promised my mum
I'd never take that one off.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.433
Speaking of...

09:32.467 --> 09:35.367
She wants to know
when I get in tomorrow.

09:37.467 --> 09:39.033
I'll text her later.

09:43.467 --> 09:45.400
I hate early flights.

09:48.433 --> 09:50.600
-You have everything?
-Yep.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.433
-Good.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.433
All right...

09:56.633 --> 09:58.166
Okay. Just...

09:58.200 --> 10:00.600
-Bye.
-Yeah, bye.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.667
-Maja?

10:42.066 --> 10:43.700
I didn't go.

10:43.734 --> 10:45.133
I got down there,
and I couldn't.

10:45.166 --> 10:48.633
I just didn't...
I didn't wanna go, so...

10:49.734 --> 10:51.100
I didn't go.

10:55.300 --> 10:57.200
This is a good thing, right?

10:57.233 --> 10:58.400
This is a good thing?
Me staying.

10:58.433 --> 11:00.600
Is it? Are we...

11:00.633 --> 11:02.000
...happy about this?
Oh, God.

11:02.033 --> 11:03.233
I'm just, yeah...

11:03.266 --> 11:05.033
That was crazy.
I'm just gonna...

11:28.166 --> 11:29.667
-MAJA:
"You could give me a look."

11:32.633 --> 11:35.600
"Walking around in the rain."

11:35.633 --> 11:37.433
ATTACHMENT

11:37.467 --> 11:39.333
"And the night has eyes."

11:43.133 --> 11:44.400
"'Cause you're beautiful now."

11:47.200 --> 11:49.800
"Yes, you're beautiful now."

11:50.734 --> 11:52.333
"Oh, for Heaven's sake."

11:55.166 --> 11:58.100
-"Open up your flower."
-Eww.

11:58.133 --> 12:00.266
That's your favorite song?

12:00.300 --> 12:04.266
-In Danish it's very romantic.
I'll find something else.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.166
Okay.

12:16.633 --> 12:18.500
You want to get that?

12:24.100 --> 12:26.133
-Hmm?
-The phone.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.500
-Oh, I'll get it later.

12:45.166 --> 12:46.734
-Are you not so hungry?

12:59.600 --> 13:02.333
Okay, I'll make
some more coffee.

13:02.367 --> 13:04.133
What?

13:05.600 --> 13:07.100
Hey...

13:09.533 --> 13:10.734
Leah?

13:11.734 --> 13:13.100
Leah!

13:27.166 --> 13:28.467
Leah?

13:32.433 --> 13:33.633
Leah?

13:36.433 --> 13:37.667
-Wake up.

13:39.567 --> 13:42.467
-Okay. I think I'm gonna
have to rest a second.

13:42.500 --> 13:45.233
-MAJA:
When is your flight tomorrow?

13:45.266 --> 13:47.467
-7:00 a.m.

13:47.500 --> 13:48.767
Apparently, one of those
cool carts

13:48.800 --> 13:50.100
is going to take me to the gate.

13:50.133 --> 13:52.000
So, that's pretty cool.

13:52.033 --> 13:55.567
-I'm really, really sorry.
-Hey, it was a seizure.

13:59.266 --> 14:00.567
I haven't had one
since I was a kid.

14:00.600 --> 14:04.000
It's weird.
It's been a really long time.

14:06.100 --> 14:07.700
It was either that or God
telling me

14:07.734 --> 14:09.300
that I'm not allowed
to stay anymore.

14:09.333 --> 14:11.600
I'm sure that's
what my mum thinks.

14:13.100 --> 14:14.500
Hey, I'm just joking.

14:17.033 --> 14:19.433
It's gonna be fine.
-I'll go with you.

14:22.667 --> 14:25.533
To London, I mean. I'll...
I'll go with you.

14:25.567 --> 14:28.400
-You don't want to come
and be in my weird house

14:28.433 --> 14:29.567
with my weird mum.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.000
-Yes, yes, I do.
I do want that.

14:50.133 --> 14:53.467
-Well, this is it.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.667
-It's lovely.

14:54.700 --> 14:56.700
All right...

15:01.166 --> 15:02.333
-Okay.

15:02.367 --> 15:04.033
Oh, Mum.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.100
-Poor thing.
-Hi.

15:08.133 --> 15:10.133
Oh, my little darling.

15:10.166 --> 15:13.200
-I'm fine.
-Nonsense.

15:13.233 --> 15:14.533
-Mum.
-Come.

15:14.567 --> 15:16.533
Mum... Mum!
That's... No, don't.

15:16.567 --> 15:19.233
That's actually
making it harder.

15:19.266 --> 15:21.333
This is Maja.
-Hey.

15:21.367 --> 15:24.500
-Chana. Nice to meet you.

15:24.533 --> 15:26.000
Nice to meet you.

15:26.033 --> 15:27.600
-My flat's upstairs.
-All right.

15:27.633 --> 15:29.100
-Mum's is this one downstairs.

15:29.133 --> 15:30.433
-Yes, I was just up there

15:30.467 --> 15:32.266
cleaning up the mess
you've left behind.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.333
Let's get you into bed.

15:37.367 --> 15:38.767
-No, I don't need to get
into bed, Mum.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.233
-Of course you do. You have
been travelling all day.

15:41.266 --> 15:44.200
And on Shabbos.
And a cab, too.

15:44.233 --> 15:45.800
-I'm literally on crutches,
and we got out a mile away.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.133
-Well, someone could
still see you.

15:48.166 --> 15:50.367
-Who cares? Don't say God cares.
-God cares.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.600
-The neighbors care.
-I care.

15:51.633 --> 15:53.433
-So you care that
the neighbors care?

15:53.467 --> 15:54.767
-I'm sorry,
I didn't know that...

15:54.800 --> 15:57.266
-Oh, no one cares about you.
-Mum!

15:57.300 --> 15:59.266
-That's not...
You know what I meant.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.700
-You're a goy.
You're not Jewish.

16:00.734 --> 16:02.233
So you can do what you want.

16:02.266 --> 16:04.600
-Exactly, whereas Leah here...
-Don't start.

16:04.633 --> 16:08.200
-Oh, my little baby.

16:08.233 --> 16:10.233
Tomorrow, I'm giving you one
of my massages.

16:10.266 --> 16:14.367
Just like when you were little
and got your funny episodes.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.000
-Great.
-Now you need to relax.

16:16.033 --> 16:17.767
-No, I'm fine.
-No, just lie down.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.767
-I don't need to.
-Just lie down and relax.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.200
Just lie down.
-Just stop!

16:22.233 --> 16:24.133
-Don't yell at me!

16:24.166 --> 16:26.133
-Yeah...

16:26.166 --> 16:27.467
You know what...

16:30.166 --> 16:32.266
You're right. I'm knackered.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.567
Why don't you just leave us
for a bit? Yeah?

16:34.600 --> 16:36.166
And I'll rest.

16:38.467 --> 16:39.767
Okay?

16:41.133 --> 16:43.400
-All right. Yes.

16:43.433 --> 16:46.333
Just don't nap too long or you
won't be able to sleep tonight.

16:50.266 --> 16:52.000
I'll bring up dinner later.

17:47.033 --> 17:49.166
Careful with that one.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.266
-Fuck. Sorry.

17:51.300 --> 17:55.400
I'm sorry.
I forgot you speak Danish.

17:55.433 --> 17:58.533
-It's impolite when Leah
is around.

17:58.567 --> 18:00.500
-Of course.

18:00.533 --> 18:04.300
I'm sorry about that.
I'll replace it.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.333
That'll be hard.
It's an antique.

18:07.367 --> 18:11.266
Hand-painted by Babylonian Jews.
It protects against demons.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.100
-Oh, God... Okay...

18:16.233 --> 18:20.734
Then I'll...
-I'm joking. It's a copy.

18:20.767 --> 18:24.266
-Ah, okay.

18:24.300 --> 18:30.166
-I made it.
So it's not that valuable.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.600
Just irreplaceable.

18:33.367 --> 18:35.567
Well, I'll run down
for the rest of the food.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.133
-Yeah.

18:38.133 --> 18:42.233
-Be careful not to cut yourself.
You're not wearing any shoes.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.800
-Amen.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.667
-It's really delicious.

19:09.533 --> 19:15.166
So, Leah tells me that you have
lived here for almost 30 years.

19:17.033 --> 19:19.233
-Mum?
-What?

19:20.300 --> 19:22.400
-No, I'm just saying that
that's a long time.

19:22.433 --> 19:25.400
I was just wondering
if you ever miss Denmark.

19:25.433 --> 19:27.600
-No...
-Mum, can it just...

19:27.633 --> 19:29.033
Can't it wait? We're eating.

19:29.066 --> 19:31.767
-But it'll just take...
-Mum.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.166
Wait. Okay?

19:34.200 --> 19:35.500
-Yes.

19:35.533 --> 19:39.600
-So, Maja has been teaching me
a bit of Danish.

19:39.633 --> 19:41.667
Using old pop songs.

19:41.700 --> 19:44.266
-Oh, really?
-Yes, well, just like '80s hits.

19:44.300 --> 19:45.533
-Yeah, actually,
you probably know them

19:45.567 --> 19:47.066
from when you were a teenager.

19:47.100 --> 19:49.266
What's that one that always
makes me laugh?

19:49.300 --> 19:50.767
"The fear is an ice flower..."

19:50.800 --> 19:52.633
-"Sjael i flammer."
-Yes. "Soul In Flames."

19:52.667 --> 19:54.633
That's the one.
Do you know that one?

19:54.667 --> 19:56.500
-No, no. I'm sorry.
I don't think I do.

19:56.533 --> 19:57.767
How does it go?

20:01.734 --> 20:03.467
-Oh, umm...

20:05.767 --> 20:07.667
Soul in flames...

20:19.133 --> 20:21.600
Fear is an ice flower
in your mind

20:28.767 --> 20:32.333
Soul in flames
Playing tricks on your mind...

20:38.033 --> 20:40.800
Inside is a little...

20:41.000 --> 20:42.300
-No, I don't think
I know that one, no.

20:42.333 --> 20:44.266
-Oh, okay.

20:44.300 --> 20:45.533
-Well, you know,
I think I'm getting

20:45.567 --> 20:47.000
pretty good at it, actually.

20:48.767 --> 20:50.433
-Okay, that's terrible.

20:50.467 --> 20:53.166
Lars H.U.G.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.333
-Sorry, I just really need to...
-Okay.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.700
It's an old Jewish superstition.

20:58.734 --> 21:01.066
Can't leave a book open
or a demon might read it

21:01.100 --> 21:03.000
and learn from it
and use the knowledge for evil.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.734
-Oh. Cool.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.066
-Shavua Tov, love.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.400
-Shavua Tov, Mum.

21:10.433 --> 21:13.100
-Thank you for helping her
get home.

21:13.133 --> 21:14.133
Oh, umm...

21:14.166 --> 21:17.233
I have this for you.

21:17.266 --> 21:19.400
It's an amethyst.

21:19.433 --> 21:20.767
It brings good luck.

21:20.800 --> 21:24.133
So you should keep it on
at all times.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.567
-Tak...

21:26.600 --> 21:30.400
I mean, yeah.
Thank you. Thank you.

21:32.567 --> 21:34.600
-Well, I think that
went pretty well.

21:36.133 --> 21:37.734
-So...

21:40.000 --> 21:42.633
Is your mum like...

21:42.667 --> 21:44.367
Is she, like...
Is she okay with this?

21:44.400 --> 21:46.066
-She's gonna love you.
Just give it some time.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.567
-Okay. All right.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.800
I mean, she has met your
girlfriends in the past, right?

21:50.000 --> 21:52.266
-Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, she knew them. Yeah.

21:52.300 --> 21:54.300
Well, she knew of them.

21:56.667 --> 21:58.066
-I'll do it.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.433
I don't know. She just...

22:01.467 --> 22:03.600
She seems really...

22:03.633 --> 22:05.000
Yeah, religious, I guess.

22:05.033 --> 22:08.233
-Oh. Yes, she is.
I mean... Well...

22:10.567 --> 22:13.266
She wasn't born into
a religious family.

22:13.300 --> 22:14.433
You know,
she was actually born into

22:14.467 --> 22:17.266
a pretty relaxed Jewish family,

22:17.300 --> 22:19.600
but then she met my dad.

22:19.633 --> 22:23.200
And she came here,
and she just couldn't fit in.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.567
You know, it's not the kind
of community you can just join.

22:28.600 --> 22:32.200
And yet, my dad still insisted
on staying here

22:32.233 --> 22:34.200
and trying to make it work.

22:35.266 --> 22:37.200
And then he just fucked off.

22:37.233 --> 22:41.400
And I think he kind of
broke something in her.

22:42.734 --> 22:45.367
Even after he left, I think
even after all this time,

22:45.400 --> 22:46.767
she still keeps trying
to fit in.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.300
And there are some people who
even humor her,

22:49.333 --> 22:51.600
like my uncle
and some of his friends.

22:51.633 --> 22:55.533
You know,
she'll go to their shops,

22:55.567 --> 22:56.767
and they'll chat
Yiddish with her

22:56.800 --> 23:00.734
and make her feel kind of
sort of welcome,

23:00.767 --> 23:04.200
but it's all kind of nonsense.

23:10.800 --> 23:15.133
But despite all of her
whatever,

23:15.166 --> 23:17.100
she has always loved me.

23:19.367 --> 23:21.000
She has, you know.

23:28.166 --> 23:29.367
So...

23:31.500 --> 23:35.400
are you still okay with this,
even now?

23:45.600 --> 23:47.066
-Yes.

25:54.266 --> 25:55.600
-Is something wrong?
-Mum, what the hell?

25:55.633 --> 25:57.667
-No, no, no,
I was just doing some exercises

25:57.700 --> 25:59.266
to help with the knee.

25:59.300 --> 26:01.100
-Mum, you can't barge in
like that.

26:01.133 --> 26:03.233
-I came to give you
your massage.

26:03.266 --> 26:05.166
-Yeah, but you've got to knock.

26:05.200 --> 26:08.166
-Knock!
-Mum, now is not a good time.

26:08.200 --> 26:11.100
-Now, Maja, it's crucial
that there be

26:11.133 --> 26:13.200
no disturbances or distractions.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.333
So maybe you should
just go for a little walk.

26:17.367 --> 26:18.667
-Yes, of course.

26:18.700 --> 26:20.066
-No, you can stay!
-No, no, no, it's fine.

26:20.100 --> 26:21.467
It's fine. It's fine.
-She's good.

26:23.233 --> 26:24.467
Lie down.

27:08.066 --> 27:11.500
-Yes, what do you want?
-Yes... Hi.

27:11.533 --> 27:15.033
Sorry, I was just wondering
if you have any books on...

27:15.066 --> 27:17.500
I'll call you back.

27:19.467 --> 27:22.767
-Hi. I was just wondering if you
have any books on, like...

27:25.433 --> 27:27.367
How to do, like...

27:27.400 --> 27:29.433
Just...

27:30.800 --> 27:33.600
Like Jewish stuff.

27:34.633 --> 27:36.567
-No.

27:36.600 --> 27:40.533
Excuse me,
if you don't mind me asking,

27:40.567 --> 27:43.200
that necklace,
where did you get it?

27:43.233 --> 27:45.467
-My friend's mum gave it to me.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.600
Yeah, I just moved here.

27:47.633 --> 27:49.700
She says it means good luck.

27:51.266 --> 27:53.233
-Yeah. Yes, yes.
You can say that.

27:53.266 --> 27:54.567
It's an amethyst.

27:54.600 --> 27:57.333
Now, they ward off demons
and the like.

27:58.467 --> 28:02.600
-Demons? Okay.
-Yes, and the like. Well...

28:02.633 --> 28:04.400
Okay.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.700
So welcome.
Welcome to the area.

28:06.734 --> 28:09.734
I'm afraid I have no such books
you're asking for.

28:09.767 --> 28:12.166
My selection caters
to a slightly more,

28:12.200 --> 28:14.600
let's say, advanced readership.

28:14.633 --> 28:16.500
-Right. Of course, yeah.

28:16.533 --> 28:18.233
-But, I mean, do feel free
to visit anytime

28:18.266 --> 28:20.367
if there's anything else
I can ever help you with.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.700
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

28:21.734 --> 28:24.433
-Okay, let me see you out.
-Okay.

28:24.467 --> 28:26.433
Bye.
-Bye-bye.

28:32.166 --> 28:34.166
-Hi.
-Hi.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.200
Oh, there you are.

28:36.233 --> 28:39.467
It's not good for Leah
to be alone.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.700
Yes, yes, of course.

28:40.734 --> 28:42.533
-Here, love.
Have some chicken soup.

28:42.567 --> 28:44.767
-How was your massage?
-Yeah, really good, actually.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.200
Mom was right, it did help.

28:46.233 --> 28:47.567
I think I fell asleep
at one point.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.633
-Yes, you did.
-That soup smells really good.

28:49.667 --> 28:52.266
-Here, try some.
-Sorry, the soup is for Leah.

28:52.300 --> 28:53.767
-Oh, sure.
-Huh?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.533
Don't... Maja, just try some.

28:56.567 --> 28:58.800
-No, the soup is for you.
You're the one who's sick.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.633
I'm not sick, Mum.
I'm just injured.

29:00.667 --> 29:02.133
-Either way.

29:02.166 --> 29:04.667
-Okay, well, is there
any more left over?

29:04.700 --> 29:06.066
-No.

29:08.266 --> 29:09.533
-You made a single bowl of soup?

29:09.567 --> 29:12.066
-Well, I'm sorry I made you
a nice soup.

29:13.233 --> 29:15.800
Perhaps Maja would prefer
I make her a soup of her own.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.667
It's not like I have
anything else to do

29:17.700 --> 29:20.133
with my life than make soup.

29:20.166 --> 29:23.066
-Why are you being so weird?
-Weird?

29:23.100 --> 29:24.400
Oh, so, caring is weird?

29:24.433 --> 29:26.100
-Will you just stop, okay?

29:26.133 --> 29:27.333
-Well, if me caring is so weird,
you know what?

29:27.367 --> 29:28.500
Let me take this soup
away from you...

29:28.533 --> 29:30.133
-What?

29:30.166 --> 29:31.367
-...so you won't be bothered
by your weird mother.

29:31.400 --> 29:32.500
-Fine.
-Fine.

29:40.533 --> 29:43.600
-Was that somehow my fault?
-Oh. You bought wine.

29:43.633 --> 29:45.166
Charmer.

30:01.266 --> 30:03.367
I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

30:03.400 --> 30:06.266
I HOPE WE CAN
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

30:10.467 --> 30:13.433
WITH THE SOUP

32:44.333 --> 32:45.667
-You sure you don't want me
to come?

32:45.700 --> 32:48.533
-No, Mum's gonna take me.
It's just the doctor.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.500
This place really isn't set up
for someone on crutches.

33:01.266 --> 33:03.066
Where is it?

33:03.100 --> 33:05.266
It didn't leave the house.

33:05.300 --> 33:07.266
Fucking wallet. Where is it?

33:13.533 --> 33:14.767
Oh, found it!

33:16.400 --> 33:17.567
Maja?

33:20.066 --> 33:21.300
Okay, see ya.

33:54.233 --> 33:57.467
-This is another amulet.
It protects the children.

34:00.033 --> 34:01.367
See these words here?
-Yeah.

34:01.400 --> 34:02.700
These are the Shemot.

34:02.734 --> 34:04.700
-Shemot.
-The names of God.

34:04.734 --> 34:06.133
-Wow.

34:06.166 --> 34:10.200
God has a lot of names.
-Yes, many names.

34:10.233 --> 34:12.633
Have you heard of the Kabbalah?

34:12.667 --> 34:16.333
-Yeah, sure. Like the Madonna
thing, right?

34:19.700 --> 34:23.800
-Okay. No, Kabbalah is
Jewish mysticism.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.633
Kabbalists believe that

34:25.667 --> 34:29.300
the names of God
can wield enormous power.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.133
Unlocking the secrets
of the universe.

34:31.166 --> 34:33.367
Warding off evil.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.433
Come. Let me show you something.

34:37.300 --> 34:38.734
Here we are.

34:40.066 --> 34:43.800
-"Sitra Achra."
-It means "The other side".

34:44.000 --> 34:48.066
It's what we use to describe
certain supernatural beings.

34:48.100 --> 34:51.400
Like the Golem. You heard
the story of the Golem?

34:51.433 --> 34:52.767
-No.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.800
-Golem is a giant monster

34:55.000 --> 34:57.200
made out of clay
by the rabbi in Prague.

34:57.233 --> 35:00.467
He made it to protect the Jews
in the city.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.033
And then he wrote one
of the Shemot,

35:02.066 --> 35:04.367
one of God's names,
onto its forehead,

35:04.400 --> 35:06.567
bringing the Golem to life.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.166
Here. Have a look.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.533
-Yeah?
-Yes.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.066
That's the Dybbuk,

35:30.100 --> 35:34.033
it's the tortured soul
of someone who died.

35:34.066 --> 35:35.633
-Just like a ghost.

35:37.233 --> 35:41.000
-No, it's not like a ghost.
It's a Dybbuk.

35:41.033 --> 35:43.667
It's not like a ghost at all.

35:43.700 --> 35:45.767
The Dybbuks possess the body
of the living.

35:45.800 --> 35:49.300
The only way to expel them
or to exorcise them

35:49.333 --> 35:53.300
is by finding out who they are
and what they want.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.633
-Like a ghost.

35:56.667 --> 35:58.533
-No! It's not a ghost.

35:58.567 --> 36:01.166
It's a Dybbuk.
-What about this one?

36:03.467 --> 36:06.000
-That's the Witch of Endor.

36:06.033 --> 36:09.567
That's the first witch
ever mentioned in the Bible.

36:09.600 --> 36:12.066
She's a very complicated figure.

36:12.100 --> 36:14.800
Some say she's good.
Some say she's bad.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.567
You see,
sorcery, black magic,

36:17.600 --> 36:20.000
it's all very forbidden
by the Talmud.

36:20.033 --> 36:23.533
Whoever practices it is
considered dangerous,

36:23.567 --> 36:24.700
sacrilegious.

36:24.734 --> 36:26.033
-What's this?

36:26.066 --> 36:27.200
-Speaking of black magic,

36:27.233 --> 36:29.500
that is a very dangerous ritual.

36:29.533 --> 36:30.667
It would also...

36:30.700 --> 36:32.700
...have to wait for another day.

36:33.734 --> 36:35.367
Another day.
-Yes.

36:35.400 --> 36:37.700
A goy tourist.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.800
-It's not too bad.
-Poor thing.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.667
-It will be better.
-Was it very painful?

37:06.567 --> 37:10.533
It was. And do you remember...
-Maja!

37:10.567 --> 37:14.066
This is my Uncle Lev,
my dad's brother.

37:14.100 --> 37:16.767
He's just decided to drop by.
Isn't that nice?

37:18.066 --> 37:19.700
Maja is a friend visiting
from Copenhagen.

37:19.734 --> 37:22.567
-What a coincidence!

37:22.600 --> 37:26.633
You see, Ms. Maja has become
a bit of a regular at my shop.

37:26.667 --> 37:28.633
-You didn't say that.

37:28.667 --> 37:30.400
-I'll get it for you. I got it.
-No, no.

37:30.433 --> 37:32.033
-I got it. I got it.
-I insist. Please.

37:32.066 --> 37:33.300
-Okay.

37:36.066 --> 37:39.767
-Please, come sit down.

37:39.800 --> 37:43.033
You see, I wanted to apologize
for earlier.

37:43.066 --> 37:45.467
I was a bit abrupt,
and I'm sorry for that.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.367
See, what we were discussing
used to be

37:48.400 --> 37:51.433
a very rich part
of Jewish mysticism.

37:51.467 --> 37:53.433
But nowadays,
it's frowned upon,

37:53.467 --> 37:57.667
and I can't be seen discussing
these things in public.

37:57.700 --> 38:00.100
And then you also forgot this.

38:00.133 --> 38:04.166
Now, you should put it back
where you found it, okay?

38:04.200 --> 38:05.333
So put it back.

38:05.367 --> 38:06.633
-Yes.
-Thank you.

38:07.633 --> 38:09.266
-Would you like a cup of tea or
do you want to stay for dinner?

38:09.300 --> 38:10.433
-I would love...

38:10.467 --> 38:13.200
-I'm sure Lev has plans.
-Mum's here.

38:13.233 --> 38:16.266
I'm just gonna go lock myself...
Gonna go to the bathroom.

38:19.066 --> 38:20.300
-Hello.

38:23.233 --> 38:27.033
-Yeah, so, it turns out
that I've been to Lev's shop.

38:27.066 --> 38:28.333
Pure coincidence.

38:29.667 --> 38:31.433
That's nice.

38:31.467 --> 38:34.700
- She doesn't
know. But she should.

38:34.734 --> 38:36.400
It's too much for you alone.

38:36.433 --> 38:37.734
That's very kind of you to ask.

38:37.767 --> 38:40.433
But there's really nothing
to worry about.

38:40.467 --> 38:42.734
It can't go on like this.

38:42.767 --> 38:44.734
-Really,
I have everything under control.

38:44.767 --> 38:48.500
It's for your own good.

38:48.533 --> 38:50.734
Yes, just the way I like it.

38:52.100 --> 38:53.400
Yes, Lev here was just saying

38:53.433 --> 38:55.467
that he has other places to be,
so...

38:57.533 --> 39:00.100
-Yes, I must get going.

39:01.567 --> 39:06.033
Okay. Oh, wait.
I almost forgot.

39:06.066 --> 39:08.033
Some snacks...
-Bambas...

39:08.066 --> 39:09.433
-...for my poor, injured niece.

39:09.467 --> 39:11.667
-Yeah, try them. They are good.
-Yeah.

39:13.400 --> 39:14.734
-They're like
peanut butter puffs.

39:14.767 --> 39:16.166
-Fuck!

39:16.200 --> 39:17.500
-Why did you throw them
on the floor?

39:17.533 --> 39:18.667
-No, no, no. Sorry, sorry.

39:18.700 --> 39:21.233
I'm just super allergic.
I can't...

39:21.266 --> 39:22.633
-Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

39:22.667 --> 39:25.133
-No, no, it's fine. Sorry.
I'm just allergic.

39:25.166 --> 39:26.567
-Yeah, but don't throw them
on the floor.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.066
-No, I'm sorry. I just...

39:28.100 --> 39:30.000
-Yes, so, perhaps Lev should
be on his way,

39:30.033 --> 39:32.233
before he kills someone.

39:32.266 --> 39:34.166
-Sorry.
-I'll walk you out.

39:34.200 --> 39:36.700
-I didn't
know she was allergic.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.400
-Chana?

40:35.767 --> 40:37.200
Are you okay?

40:39.233 --> 40:42.800
-I locked myself out.
-You could just come up to us.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.767
-Leah's got a spare key, right?
-Yes.

40:45.800 --> 40:48.734
-I'll wake her.
-No, don't do that!

40:51.233 --> 40:52.567
I've had a few drinks.

40:54.333 --> 40:59.800
And that's not...
It's best if you don't...

41:07.400 --> 41:08.600
-Stay there.

41:13.734 --> 41:15.633
This is actually the first time
I'm seeing your flat...

41:18.300 --> 41:20.633
-Thank you.
-Hey...

41:23.333 --> 41:28.166
I was wondering if you would
show me around the neighborhood.

41:28.200 --> 41:31.266
Leah is meeting
with her advisor.

41:31.300 --> 41:32.767
-It's not a good time.

41:32.800 --> 41:37.266
I have a lot to do.
-And...

41:37.300 --> 41:40.300
...you look like someone
who could use a helping hand.

41:56.667 --> 41:58.100
-The usual, please.

42:04.734 --> 42:07.266
Are you sure?

42:07.300 --> 42:09.533
-It's fine. Just wrap it extra
carefully, please.

42:09.567 --> 42:11.300
Thank you.

42:59.133 --> 43:00.467
-Christmas is all
I can think about!

43:00.500 --> 43:01.767
Father Christmas,
maybe we're all...

43:01.800 --> 43:04.367
-What are you watching?
-Nothing.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.767
Just doing lots of very boring
reading, writing.

43:07.800 --> 43:09.300
-Seriously,
what are you watching?

43:09.333 --> 43:12.100
-It's actually
a very helpful documentary

43:12.133 --> 43:14.367
about wealth
and resource distribution

43:14.400 --> 43:17.200
from the North Pole.

43:17.233 --> 43:19.233
-Oh, no.

43:19.266 --> 43:21.233
-Okay, I've actually watched,
like, eight episodes by now,

43:21.266 --> 43:22.500
and you're so good in it.

43:22.533 --> 43:24.066
-No, stop.

43:24.100 --> 43:25.166
-You want to watch
an episode with me?

43:25.200 --> 43:26.100
-No.

43:31.600 --> 43:35.033
-Well, you know,
for what it's worth,

43:35.066 --> 43:37.367
I actually find seeing you
on screen quite hot.

43:57.533 --> 43:59.500
-What's that?
-What's what?

44:10.000 --> 44:13.233
You all right?
-Yeah, it's great. It's great.

44:13.266 --> 44:14.667
It's great.

44:14.700 --> 44:16.166
Come here.

44:33.400 --> 44:34.533
-Babe?

44:34.567 --> 44:36.500
-Sorry, sorry.
-What's going on?

44:36.533 --> 44:37.767
-I heard something.
I got distracted.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.767
Sorry. Sorry.

44:41.400 --> 44:44.300
What is that?
-It's the fucking bed, Maja.

44:44.333 --> 44:45.633
It creaks sometimes.

44:48.100 --> 44:50.000
-Sorry, I just... I...

44:51.266 --> 44:54.066
I thought someone was in here.
-Thought someone was in here?

44:54.100 --> 44:55.467
Where would they be?
Like, under the bed?

44:55.500 --> 44:56.734
-I don't know.
Just a few nights ago

44:56.767 --> 44:59.166
I heard these, like, footsteps.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.600
What, you don't hear it?

45:03.633 --> 45:05.700
-You probably just need
some sleep or something.

45:05.734 --> 45:07.166
I'm gonna go pee.

45:10.567 --> 45:13.367
-Speaking of sleep,
could we maybe just...

45:15.266 --> 45:16.567
...not light that candle
tonight?

45:16.600 --> 45:18.000
-What candle?

45:20.533 --> 45:21.767
-Well, the...

45:29.433 --> 45:31.000
Okay.

45:56.133 --> 45:58.300
-Okay, I don't know
how to say this.

46:01.233 --> 46:04.200
I was just thinking
it's really weird

46:04.233 --> 46:07.333
that we hardly know each other,
you know, like...

46:07.367 --> 46:09.133
You weren't even supposed
to be here.

46:12.066 --> 46:13.300
I guess...

46:17.066 --> 46:19.000
I just wanted to thank you.

46:21.567 --> 46:23.000
'Cause...

46:27.433 --> 46:32.266
I have never been
in anything like this before.

46:32.300 --> 46:36.567
Like, this serious. Like...

46:36.600 --> 46:40.767
And I feel like I might not be
very good at it all the time.

46:45.433 --> 46:47.133
But you're still here.

46:50.100 --> 46:51.367
So...

46:57.433 --> 46:59.000
Thank you.

46:59.033 --> 47:00.233
And...

47:03.000 --> 47:05.767
You know, like, maybe when
my leg's got better...

47:07.734 --> 47:10.300
...we can think about going
somewhere, like...

47:12.000 --> 47:14.133
...the two of us.
We'll try something new.

47:41.133 --> 47:42.467
-Wake up.

47:44.300 --> 47:47.567
Please. Wake up.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.633
You have to wake up now.

47:57.800 --> 48:00.266
-Ms. Maja.
-Oh, hi.

48:00.300 --> 48:02.400
Sorry, they've just left
for the physiotherapist.

48:02.433 --> 48:03.633
-No, it's okay.
It's a good thing.

48:03.667 --> 48:05.433
I came to see you.

48:06.500 --> 48:08.734
I thought you might need
a little something to read.

48:13.600 --> 48:15.100
Can I come in?

48:15.133 --> 48:17.233
How are you getting along
with my sister-in-law?

48:17.266 --> 48:19.066
-Oh, uhh...

48:19.100 --> 48:20.700
Good, I think.
-Mm-hmm?

48:20.734 --> 48:24.233
-Yeah, great. She's just...

48:24.266 --> 48:27.300
Yeah, she's just great,
you know. She's just wonderful.

48:27.333 --> 48:29.333
-I mean, she can be a little...

48:31.266 --> 48:33.600
...complicated to be around.

48:33.633 --> 48:35.600
-Yeah, sometimes, maybe.

48:37.433 --> 48:39.133
Actually, I think
she absolutely hates me.

48:39.166 --> 48:41.533
-No, come on. No.
-Yes, I think she does.

48:41.567 --> 48:43.333
-She certainly doesn't hate you
for the reasons

48:43.367 --> 48:44.567
you might think she hates you.

48:44.600 --> 48:46.166
-What do you mean?

48:46.200 --> 48:49.066
-Well, I mean, I know some
friendships are close.

48:49.100 --> 48:51.033
But very few friendships
are so close

48:51.066 --> 48:53.467
in an apartment
with only one bed.

48:53.500 --> 48:57.500
-No, no. It's not like that.
-Listen, I don't care.

48:57.533 --> 49:00.066
Really, I mean, I could care,

49:00.100 --> 49:02.266
perhaps I should care,
but I really don't care.

49:02.300 --> 49:05.433
And I can promise you,
neither does Chana.

49:07.300 --> 49:09.533
You see, she is...

49:11.066 --> 49:15.767
She's a very troubled woman,
and she's in a lot of pain.

49:15.800 --> 49:19.667
She is in more pain
than you could ever imagine.

49:19.700 --> 49:23.633
I wish I could help her,
but I can't.

49:23.667 --> 49:25.433
Neither can Leah, but...

49:27.600 --> 49:29.600
While it might not
seem like that,

49:29.633 --> 49:33.767
I think perhaps you might be
able to help her.

49:33.800 --> 49:37.700
-I don't think I get it.
-Just wait, and you'll see.

49:41.800 --> 49:43.667
Just put it there.

49:43.700 --> 49:46.567
-I can bring it in for you.
-I'll get it.

49:46.600 --> 49:48.133
No, just put them there.

49:48.166 --> 49:50.000
-It's no problem.
I might as well bring them in...

49:50.033 --> 49:53.033
-Just do as I tell you.
-I just want to help you...

49:53.066 --> 49:54.500
-I don't need your help.
Give me that.

49:54.533 --> 49:55.734
-No, but...

49:59.767 --> 50:04.000
-Excuse me, but don't you have
anything better to do?

50:04.033 --> 50:05.400
I don't understand
what's wrong with you.

50:05.433 --> 50:07.333
Why are you so persistent?

50:07.367 --> 50:09.200
-Because...

50:09.233 --> 50:11.567
Because I'm trying
to make a good impression.

50:11.600 --> 50:13.100
-Why?

50:13.133 --> 50:16.133
-Because I love your daughter,
you fucking tool!

50:16.166 --> 50:17.433
Because I'm madly in love
with her,

50:17.467 --> 50:19.300
and I want to do
everything I can

50:19.333 --> 50:20.667
to have a good life with her,

50:20.700 --> 50:22.100
and you're making it
ridiculously hard for me.

50:22.133 --> 50:23.734
"Put the bags there.
No, don't do that.

50:23.767 --> 50:26.066
You need to come home sooner.
No, go for a walk."

50:34.400 --> 50:38.100
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

50:38.133 --> 50:39.700
I shouldn't have
called you a tool,

50:39.734 --> 50:42.333
or made fun of the way you talk,
or made that...

50:44.266 --> 50:46.467
...fart noise. Fuck!

50:50.233 --> 50:53.633
I'm sorry, Chana. I'm sorry,
there's just...

50:56.200 --> 50:57.600
...a lot going on.

51:07.133 --> 51:10.567
I just sat there
in my dead mum's flat.

51:10.600 --> 51:12.700
I just stopped doing things.

51:12.734 --> 51:14.800
I didn't even pick up the phone
when it rang.

51:18.800 --> 51:20.367
Everyone else had...

51:24.000 --> 51:27.400
...gotten real fucking lives
and real homes and real jobs

51:27.433 --> 51:29.667
and real children.

51:33.600 --> 51:35.667
And then suddenly,
there was Leah.

51:38.100 --> 51:43.667
Someone to love.
Someone to take care of.

51:43.700 --> 51:47.233
Someone to get up for
in the morning.

51:47.266 --> 51:53.033
I don't know, now I just feel
that if it's not about her,

51:53.066 --> 51:54.567
or when it's not for her,

51:54.600 --> 51:58.633
then I don't know what to do
with myself.

51:58.667 --> 52:02.266
That's weird, isn't it?

52:02.300 --> 52:03.767
That you can feel like that.

52:03.800 --> 52:05.734
-Yes, you should probably be
careful about that.

52:09.133 --> 52:10.367
You end up becoming
someone else.

52:10.400 --> 52:11.734
And you have to be careful
about that.

52:15.133 --> 52:20.000
You become someone else,
and that's dangerous.

52:27.300 --> 52:31.033
-Why did you stay... here?

52:31.066 --> 52:32.300
-For Leah.

52:38.800 --> 52:41.700
-It's a good thing
that she has you.

52:44.166 --> 52:47.500
But I do look forward
to her leg getting better,

52:47.533 --> 52:49.734
so we can travel.

52:49.767 --> 52:53.000
Find a new, exciting place
to live.

53:00.266 --> 53:03.734
-Is that something Leah has...

53:03.767 --> 53:08.066
-No, no, it's... It's just
something we've talked about.

53:08.100 --> 53:09.333
We think it's
really great that...

53:09.367 --> 53:11.166
-I have to make dinner now.

53:33.700 --> 53:36.133
What's this?
-A book Lev gave me.

53:36.166 --> 53:37.433
-He shouldn't give you this.

53:37.467 --> 53:38.600
-Oh, stop, it's just
a sweet present...

53:38.633 --> 53:40.633
-And stay away from Lev!
-Come on...

53:40.667 --> 53:42.033
-No!

53:46.333 --> 53:48.066
Do as I tell you!

53:56.400 --> 54:01.500
-Lev, stop. You will not
go behind my back again.

54:02.734 --> 54:05.100
Stop talking to the girl.

54:05.133 --> 54:08.533
Stop giving her things.
Stay out of it!

54:08.567 --> 54:11.700
No, I'm coming over
with the book.

55:07.300 --> 55:08.533
-No.

57:41.567 --> 57:45.166
-Leah! Please wake up.

57:46.300 --> 57:47.533
Fuck.

57:56.400 --> 57:58.000
-Maja, what the fuck is wrong
with you?

57:58.033 --> 58:00.033
Magic and poisoned chicken soup
and Kabbalah?

58:00.066 --> 58:01.734
-I know how it sounds, okay,

58:01.767 --> 58:03.500
but I'm telling you,
she's coming in here at night,

58:03.533 --> 58:05.266
and she's lighting candles...
-No one is coming in here.

58:05.300 --> 58:07.500
-Listen. Just look.

58:07.533 --> 58:09.600
Just look at this.
-What... What is that?

58:09.633 --> 58:11.400
-It's a drawing
of your apartment.

58:11.433 --> 58:13.667
This is your furniture, and she,
like, arranges it in a pattern.

58:13.700 --> 58:15.567
-Maja, why are you showing
me this? I don't care.

58:15.600 --> 58:17.266
-I'm just saying that she's,
like, sick.

58:17.300 --> 58:19.533
She's just... She's like
mentally ill.

58:19.567 --> 58:22.600
-I know! Don't you think
I fucking know that?

58:22.633 --> 58:24.633
Why do you think I'm still here?

58:24.667 --> 58:26.333
This is what I've been trying
to tell you.

58:26.367 --> 58:29.133
She's not well,
and she needs me.

58:32.133 --> 58:34.767
-Okay. I understand that
she needs you...

58:34.800 --> 58:37.000
-You know...

58:37.033 --> 58:38.333
Maybe this was a mistake.

58:42.500 --> 58:44.400
I think maybe we got ahead
of ourselves.

58:47.433 --> 58:49.800
You need to just go
and clear your head.

58:58.767 --> 59:00.333
You're not wearing your amulet.

59:03.433 --> 59:06.633
Maybe she's right.
Perhaps it was a mistake.

59:06.667 --> 59:09.600
Perhaps you should just go home.

59:09.633 --> 59:12.300
For your own sake.

59:15.266 --> 59:16.667
-I'm not afraid of you.

59:22.033 --> 59:23.467
-You know that's not true.

59:32.100 --> 59:33.467
-Fuck!

1:01:04.600 --> 1:01:06.533
-You have to...
You have to help me!

1:01:06.567 --> 1:01:07.734
-No. Listen,
I can't talk to you.

1:01:07.767 --> 1:01:09.233
Chana told me to stay away...

1:01:09.266 --> 1:01:11.300
-You don't understand.
She's going to kill her.

1:01:11.333 --> 1:01:13.633
Okay? And Leah doesn't
believe me, but I saw it.

1:01:13.667 --> 1:01:16.367
-Don't talk to Leah about it.

1:01:20.066 --> 1:01:21.433
Just forget everything
I ever said.

1:01:21.467 --> 1:01:23.633
Forget everything
I ever told you.

1:01:23.667 --> 1:01:25.767
Get away from her
as fast as you can.

1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:29.166
Now, you listen to me.
She is very, very dangerous.

1:01:45.700 --> 1:01:48.433
Hello. So happy to see you.

1:01:48.467 --> 1:01:50.133
Come in.

1:01:51.567 --> 1:01:53.133
-Thank you.

1:01:55.166 --> 1:01:56.467
Let me take that.
I'll get it ready.

1:01:56.500 --> 1:01:58.500
-No, I can...
-Mum.

1:01:58.533 --> 1:02:00.166
Shabbat shalom.

1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:02.166
-Come in.
-Gut Shabbos, love.

1:02:09.233 --> 1:02:11.300
-This looks lovely.
-It's all Maja.

1:02:41.633 --> 1:02:43.100
-L'chaim.

1:02:45.166 --> 1:02:47.133
To fresh starts.

1:02:48.667 --> 1:02:50.800
-L'chaim.
-L'chaim.

1:02:55.300 --> 1:02:57.467
-Mum, the chicken's really good.
-Thank you, love.

1:02:57.500 --> 1:03:00.133
-Very good.

1:03:00.166 --> 1:03:03.233
-So, you know how I was
getting all upset

1:03:03.266 --> 1:03:05.300
about my supervisor
the other day?

1:03:05.333 --> 1:03:06.533
-Yes.

1:03:06.567 --> 1:03:08.667
-He actually sent me
an email today.

1:03:08.700 --> 1:03:10.800
And it was a lot better
than I thought.

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:12.533
You know I had
that really bad...

1:03:12.567 --> 1:03:13.767
-That's good.
-...meeting with him.

1:03:13.800 --> 1:03:15.367
Yeah, but...

1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:17.166
He said that the edits that
I just sent through

1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:18.734
on my chapters
were pretty good.

1:03:18.767 --> 1:03:20.200
So...

1:03:21.166 --> 1:03:22.600
He also said that...

1:03:29.166 --> 1:03:30.367
-Maja, are you okay?

1:03:35.467 --> 1:03:37.100
-What's wrong with her? Maja?

1:03:38.233 --> 1:03:39.500
Maja!

1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:43.400
Mum, Mum, help her.
-EpiPen.

1:03:43.433 --> 1:03:45.300
-EpiPen. She's having
an allergic reaction.

1:03:45.333 --> 1:03:46.767
Bathroom! Bathroom mirror!
Behind the bathroom mirror!

1:03:46.800 --> 1:03:48.633
Just hang on, hang on.

1:03:49.600 --> 1:03:51.367
Maja, hold on, just hold on.

1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:53.800
Quick. Give it to her now.

1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:56.300
Hold on.

1:04:06.367 --> 1:04:07.633
Maja?

1:04:10.567 --> 1:04:12.467
What the fuck just happened?

1:04:17.500 --> 1:04:20.200
-The food.
-What?

1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:37.367
Are those peanuts?

1:04:42.233 --> 1:04:44.300
Did you just put peanuts
in her chicken?

1:04:45.533 --> 1:04:46.767
-What?

1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:50.133
-Mum, you could have killed her.

1:04:53.100 --> 1:04:54.500
-Why would I...

1:04:57.100 --> 1:05:00.500
-I need you to go now.
-But I...

1:05:13.333 --> 1:05:18.367
-You're
insane. You have no idea.

1:05:18.400 --> 1:05:20.567
-Mum?

1:05:20.600 --> 1:05:24.300
-Without me,
you're going to die.

1:05:24.333 --> 1:05:27.633
Both of you.
He will kill you.

1:05:27.667 --> 1:05:29.367
-Mum, you need to go now.

1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:30.667
-He will kill my little girl.

1:05:30.700 --> 1:05:32.467
-What are you talking about?

1:05:32.500 --> 1:05:36.233
And it's all your fault!

1:05:36.266 --> 1:05:38.133
-I said go!

1:05:40.066 --> 1:05:43.800
-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I lost my temper.

1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:48.266
I apologize, Maja.
I'm so sorry.

1:05:49.533 --> 1:05:54.100
I don't know how the peanuts
got in the food. Really, I...

1:05:55.567 --> 1:05:57.767
I'm sure it was...

1:05:57.800 --> 1:06:01.200
...some kind of accident.
Don't you...

1:06:06.700 --> 1:06:09.100
Maybe we should all just
get some rest,

1:06:09.133 --> 1:06:11.433
and we'll talk in the morning.

1:06:11.467 --> 1:06:14.200
And a fresh start.

1:06:17.200 --> 1:06:18.700
Right?

1:06:20.333 --> 1:06:21.600
Love?

1:06:26.166 --> 1:06:29.667
Right? Yes. Let's all...

1:06:31.266 --> 1:06:33.166
...clear our heads, and...

1:06:44.033 --> 1:06:46.033
-You were right.

1:06:47.500 --> 1:06:50.100
She's lost it.
-No, I'm sure she's just...

1:06:50.133 --> 1:06:51.667
-She tried to fucking kill you.

1:06:51.700 --> 1:06:53.533
-Yeah, well...

1:06:55.266 --> 1:06:57.133
-What are we going to do?

1:06:57.166 --> 1:06:58.734
-I guess she needs help.

1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:01.400
But...

1:07:03.066 --> 1:07:06.533
I also think that it is not safe
to stay here right now.

1:07:06.567 --> 1:07:08.100
-We can't just leave her here.

1:07:08.133 --> 1:07:10.066
-Maybe your uncle can
look after her?

1:07:19.166 --> 1:07:20.533
I'm just gonna go
get some water.

1:08:08.033 --> 1:08:09.266
-So...

1:08:11.433 --> 1:08:13.000
Where should we go?

1:08:25.667 --> 1:08:27.033
-Please...

1:08:32.367 --> 1:08:33.767
Please wake up.

1:08:43.433 --> 1:08:45.000
Won't you please wake up?

1:08:53.500 --> 1:08:56.367
-Yeah, my dad never really
uses this place.

1:08:56.400 --> 1:08:59.033
-It's nice. It's quiet.

1:08:59.066 --> 1:09:00.333
-Yeah.

1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:07.133
We don't have to stay for long.
-Yeah, we'll figure it out.

1:09:07.166 --> 1:09:10.200
-Yeah. We'll figure it out.

1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:16.066
Then we can move on...

1:09:16.100 --> 1:09:18.166
...once your leg is better.

1:10:54.333 --> 1:10:55.700
-Hey.

1:10:57.166 --> 1:10:58.533
What are you doing?

1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:10.066
All right. Well...

1:11:10.100 --> 1:11:13.033
I thought that I would try
to make osso buco tonight.

1:11:20.166 --> 1:11:21.567
You have to eat something,
right?

1:11:25.433 --> 1:11:26.667
-I ate.

1:11:29.800 --> 1:11:31.233
-How's your leg?

1:11:36.400 --> 1:11:37.734
Wonderful.

1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:40.200
Wonderful.

1:12:57.233 --> 1:12:58.433
Hi.

1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:14.667
Shit!

1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:18.066
Okay, we have to go
to the doctor, please.

1:13:18.100 --> 1:13:20.166
-Why? My leg's fine.

1:13:20.200 --> 1:13:23.467
-I know it's fine,
but I mean, just...

1:13:23.500 --> 1:13:26.333
Look at yourself.
-Do I not look beautiful?

1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:34.100
-Yeah. Yes, you do.
You always do, I'm just...

1:13:35.300 --> 1:13:38.033
I'm really worried about this.
You look...

1:13:46.767 --> 1:13:50.600
Okay, I... I have to go
meet someone. Just...

1:13:50.633 --> 1:13:53.200
Just stay, okay?
Just stay here.

1:13:55.600 --> 1:13:57.066
Stay.

1:14:26.233 --> 1:14:27.767
-Hi.
-Thank you for coming.

1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:29.700
Thank you. I can't believe
you came all the way. Thank you.

1:14:29.734 --> 1:14:34.333
-Of course, but listen.
I just don't understand.

1:14:34.367 --> 1:14:36.600
So, you live here in the forest?

1:14:38.300 --> 1:14:40.066
-No, no, no.

1:14:40.100 --> 1:14:42.033
We have...
We have, like, a house.

1:14:42.066 --> 1:14:43.400
It's my dad's house,
a summer house.

1:14:43.433 --> 1:14:45.467
Up here. Yeah.
-So why don't we meet there?

1:14:45.500 --> 1:14:47.200
I mean, this is a very strange
place to meet.

1:14:47.233 --> 1:14:49.533
-Yeah.

1:14:49.567 --> 1:14:51.367
She doesn't know
that you're here.

1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:53.333
-Mm-hmm.
-And also I...

1:14:54.734 --> 1:14:56.266
I really want to talk
to you first.

1:14:56.300 --> 1:14:59.633
-Okay, so you told me that
she's... She's sick.

1:14:59.667 --> 1:15:01.567
I don't know.
Something is just...

1:15:03.166 --> 1:15:05.467
...wrong.

1:15:05.500 --> 1:15:06.667
I've tried everything.

1:15:06.700 --> 1:15:08.400
I've tried to take her
to a doctor.

1:15:08.433 --> 1:15:10.800
I've tried to get her help.

1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:12.500
But it's like...

1:15:14.100 --> 1:15:15.333
It's like she's...

1:15:18.667 --> 1:15:22.400
I don't know.
Just... not there.

1:15:24.300 --> 1:15:26.600
-Maybe we should
just go see her.

1:15:26.633 --> 1:15:28.333
Where is she?

1:15:28.367 --> 1:15:30.266
I told you to wait!

1:15:30.300 --> 1:15:31.467
- You promised
me you wouldn't tell her.

1:15:31.500 --> 1:15:32.700
-Where is my daughter?
-Stop! Stop!

1:15:32.734 --> 1:15:34.200
-Stay away.

1:15:34.233 --> 1:15:35.500
Okay, I saw what you did to her.

1:15:35.533 --> 1:15:37.066
-I'm so sorry, Ms. Maja, but...

1:15:37.100 --> 1:15:40.033
There's something
you need to know.

1:15:40.066 --> 1:15:41.133
-Hello?

1:15:41.166 --> 1:15:43.433
Hello?

1:15:46.734 --> 1:15:48.133
Hello?

1:15:51.767 --> 1:15:53.333
Oh, I'm sorry.

1:15:53.367 --> 1:15:57.133
I was just wondering
if you had seen my cat.

1:15:57.166 --> 1:15:59.133
I haven't seen him since
yesterday morning.

1:16:01.767 --> 1:16:07.500
I have had a picture made.
His name is Findus.

1:16:10.367 --> 1:16:16.300
He's just one year old,
so he's my little "baby".

1:16:19.667 --> 1:16:21.233
How far along are you?

1:16:30.166 --> 1:16:34.433
-Well... I should get going.

1:16:34.467 --> 1:16:36.166
-I saw your cat.

1:16:42.467 --> 1:16:43.767
-She was seven

1:16:43.800 --> 1:16:46.333
when she started
having those tremors.

1:16:46.367 --> 1:16:49.066
We thought it was epilepsy,

1:16:49.100 --> 1:16:53.100
but the episodes
got ever more violent.

1:16:56.567 --> 1:16:59.467
And she looked different.

1:17:00.433 --> 1:17:02.000
She would get very angry.

1:17:07.333 --> 1:17:09.000
And then one day...

1:17:15.667 --> 1:17:19.800
...she had a friend over.

1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:26.066
A little girl who
lived down the road.

1:17:26.100 --> 1:17:29.033
I could hear them playing.

1:17:33.433 --> 1:17:36.166
Suddenly,
it went strangely quiet.

1:17:46.200 --> 1:17:47.700
They said it was an accident.

1:17:50.166 --> 1:17:53.800
A game gone wrong.

1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:55.767
It was no accident.

1:17:55.800 --> 1:17:58.667
And it wasn't my Leah
who did it.

1:17:58.700 --> 1:18:00.700
Please wake up!

1:18:06.166 --> 1:18:08.367
-Who was it then?
-A Dybbuk.

1:18:14.333 --> 1:18:15.600
-A Dybbuk.

1:18:15.633 --> 1:18:18.266
It's a dead soul
in a living host.

1:18:18.300 --> 1:18:21.633
And this one, this particularly
cruel and evil one,

1:18:21.667 --> 1:18:24.166
has possessed Leah
for many years.

1:18:24.200 --> 1:18:25.567
-That thing from the book?

1:18:28.467 --> 1:18:31.533
That's what you think
is wrong with her?

1:18:31.567 --> 1:18:36.300
-I mean, we tried to exorcise
him when she was just a child.

1:18:36.333 --> 1:18:39.533
But he wouldn't tell us who
he was or what he wanted.

1:18:39.567 --> 1:18:41.066
-And have you ever...

1:18:42.166 --> 1:18:45.800
I don't know, have you ever,
like, mentioned this to Leah?

1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:48.567
-No, which was a mistake.
I warned you.

1:18:48.600 --> 1:18:51.367
We can't keep it a secret.

1:18:51.400 --> 1:18:52.633
We should have told her.

1:18:52.667 --> 1:18:55.567
We should have told
her friends, too,

1:18:55.600 --> 1:18:57.266
you know, before they did
something reckless

1:18:57.300 --> 1:18:59.266
like run off
to some remote forest.

1:18:59.300 --> 1:19:01.200
-Okay, once again,
we don't live in the forest.

1:19:01.233 --> 1:19:02.767
Okay? We have a house.
-Yes.

1:19:02.800 --> 1:19:05.033
But with her and you
so far away,

1:19:05.066 --> 1:19:06.767
it's hard for us to protect her.

1:19:06.800 --> 1:19:12.367
I think it's very important that
we get to see her now, please.

1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:14.467
If it's too late,
then we might have to try to...

1:19:14.500 --> 1:19:16.700
-No. No, we're not doing that.

1:19:16.734 --> 1:19:18.300
-It might be too late,

1:19:18.333 --> 1:19:19.734
and there's enough of us here
to perform this...

1:19:19.767 --> 1:19:21.166
-No. We're not...
-Okay.

1:19:21.200 --> 1:19:23.633
I'll take you to her.

1:19:23.667 --> 1:19:25.033
-Good.

1:19:25.066 --> 1:19:27.100
-Yeah? Where is your car?

1:19:27.133 --> 1:19:28.633
-I don't even remember.

1:19:28.667 --> 1:19:31.200
It's a very impractical place
for us to meet, this...

1:19:31.233 --> 1:19:32.533
All these trees.
-You know what?

1:19:32.567 --> 1:19:34.667
Let me get my bike.
I'll walk you to the car.

1:19:34.700 --> 1:19:36.033
And then you can follow me
up the road.

1:19:36.066 --> 1:19:37.533
-Yes.
-I'll take you to the house.

1:19:37.567 --> 1:19:38.767
-Some parking lot
in that direction.

1:19:38.800 --> 1:19:40.400
-Okay? Just go ahead.
-Tak.

1:19:55.133 --> 1:19:56.400
-Leah?

1:20:16.700 --> 1:20:18.266
Listen, we...

1:20:19.667 --> 1:20:23.600
We really need to go, okay?
-Why? I like it here.

1:20:29.233 --> 1:20:31.033
-Can you stop that, please?

1:20:55.133 --> 1:20:56.700
You're not okay.

1:20:58.633 --> 1:21:00.734
-It's very hurtful
when you say that.

1:21:00.767 --> 1:21:02.500
It makes me upset.

1:21:06.033 --> 1:21:07.567
-Something is really wrong.

1:21:09.800 --> 1:21:13.266
-Maybe it's because
you won't let me see my mum.

1:21:14.567 --> 1:21:18.433
I miss my mum.
-I'm sorry, okay?

1:21:18.467 --> 1:21:23.533
But listen, we really...
We have to get out of here.

1:21:23.567 --> 1:21:28.500
-You just tore my life to
shreds, pretending you love me.

1:21:32.533 --> 1:21:34.100
You're so sad.

1:21:38.300 --> 1:21:41.000
You're just... aimless.

1:21:41.033 --> 1:21:43.600
Your whole life is...

1:21:43.633 --> 1:21:45.400
...broken.

1:21:46.600 --> 1:21:49.100
Isn't it?

1:21:49.133 --> 1:21:51.200
It's too late to fix it now.

1:21:52.633 --> 1:21:56.233
-You're too old.
-Stop it.

1:21:57.734 --> 1:22:00.266
Better to break someone else's.

1:22:13.600 --> 1:22:15.367
-Hey, hey, hey.

1:22:35.767 --> 1:22:37.300
-Maja?

1:22:42.467 --> 1:22:43.767
Help!

1:22:53.500 --> 1:22:55.033
Maja?

1:22:59.633 --> 1:23:01.000
Where are you?

1:24:59.500 --> 1:25:03.300
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS CAT?

1:25:50.166 --> 1:25:53.300
Love you forever...

1:26:12.100 --> 1:26:13.500
-Ms. Maja?

1:26:18.500 --> 1:26:21.066
Take it easy.
Slide over here.

1:26:24.100 --> 1:26:26.000
Don't worry. It can't move.

1:26:29.633 --> 1:26:31.200
Are you all right?

1:26:33.100 --> 1:26:35.266
I'm so sorry that
you had to see this.

1:26:37.367 --> 1:26:38.667
-What happened to her?

1:26:41.300 --> 1:26:43.200
-LEV:
She left home for too long.

1:26:46.433 --> 1:26:50.000
Away from everyone and
everything that kept her safe.

1:27:56.300 --> 1:27:57.500
I'm sorry.

1:28:01.233 --> 1:28:03.467
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that I...

1:28:08.567 --> 1:28:09.800
I only did it
because I love her.

1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:11.367
I know.

1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:16.000
I know.

1:28:21.066 --> 1:28:22.667
She was so happy.

1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:30.000
When we had found a way
to keep him at bay...

1:28:31.100 --> 1:28:35.633
...and she had become herself
again, she was just so...

1:28:35.667 --> 1:28:37.100
...happy.

1:28:39.533 --> 1:28:42.734
She had no memory
of what had happened.

1:28:44.333 --> 1:28:46.000
She was just Leah.

1:28:50.300 --> 1:28:52.200
I had my Leah back.

1:28:55.467 --> 1:28:57.467
If she had known...

1:29:01.500 --> 1:29:05.133
If she had known that
that thing was inside her...

1:29:08.133 --> 1:29:10.200
...just waiting to get out,

1:29:10.233 --> 1:29:13.567
I would have never
seen her happy again.

1:29:20.467 --> 1:29:22.033
We have to start now.

1:29:37.433 --> 1:29:41.567
This is our last resort.

1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:45.033
We hope it won't have
to come to this.

1:29:45.066 --> 1:29:48.500
But we have to prepare...

1:29:49.567 --> 1:29:51.500
...a Soul Devourer.

1:29:56.467 --> 1:30:01.400
It's this...
this black magic ritual.

1:30:01.433 --> 1:30:03.567
We haven't really tried it
before, so...

1:30:08.200 --> 1:30:12.200
Yeah, we'll start by creating
this holy ring,

1:30:12.233 --> 1:30:16.066
and we'll use this bowl
to seal the ring.

1:30:16.100 --> 1:30:19.000
Thus trapping the soul
within the circle.

1:30:19.033 --> 1:30:22.800
Now Leah is fully under
the Dybbuk's control.

1:30:27.133 --> 1:30:30.033
So that if the Dybbuk is
in the circle,

1:30:30.066 --> 1:30:33.300
well, then that's who
the Devourer...

1:30:36.100 --> 1:30:40.567
...will...devour.

1:30:41.700 --> 1:30:46.100
However, the ritual cannot
be interrupted once begun.

1:30:46.133 --> 1:30:49.200
That's what it says.

1:30:49.233 --> 1:30:54.333
Once my friends begin chanting
the Shemot, the names of God,

1:30:54.367 --> 1:30:57.400
the Devourer will come
for a soul.

1:30:57.433 --> 1:31:01.166
If one is not offered
in the circle,

1:31:01.200 --> 1:31:05.333
it will look for souls
elsewhere, and...

1:31:05.367 --> 1:31:06.800
-We all die.

1:31:09.166 --> 1:31:10.700
-Yes.

1:31:13.333 --> 1:31:16.400
That's why we'll first try
and talk to it.

1:31:16.433 --> 1:31:19.100
You know, the negotiation
with the Dybbuk...

1:31:21.300 --> 1:31:24.633
...to finally find out who he is
and what he wants.

1:31:24.667 --> 1:31:29.734
It may not work. It has not
really in the past, so...

1:31:37.100 --> 1:31:40.000
But we must try one last time.

1:31:48.133 --> 1:31:49.467
Wake it up.

1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:33.400
I see. Very exciting.

1:32:41.567 --> 1:32:43.400
You're all here.

1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:46.400
That's nice.

1:32:51.266 --> 1:32:53.700
-Hold out your arm.
-Quiet.

1:32:55.633 --> 1:32:57.200
I'm thinking.

1:33:06.200 --> 1:33:08.033
Chana.

1:33:09.633 --> 1:33:13.633
Mummy. My favorite.

1:33:13.667 --> 1:33:17.066
-Hold out your arm.
-I said, quiet!

1:33:17.100 --> 1:33:20.100
You'd think being trapped
for 20 years would be dull.

1:33:21.166 --> 1:33:22.400
Not with you.

1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:30.400
I got to watch you
ruin your life.

1:33:32.100 --> 1:33:34.600
If you knew how many of those
little routines and rituals

1:33:34.633 --> 1:33:37.166
were a complete and utter
waste of time...

1:33:43.433 --> 1:33:45.000
...you'd want to die.

1:33:49.533 --> 1:33:51.200
And, Maja...

1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:54.166
You and I...

1:33:58.433 --> 1:34:00.166
We were gonna have such fun.

1:34:02.500 --> 1:34:04.233
Oh, well. Here you go.

1:34:23.133 --> 1:34:26.266
-Tell me who you are
and what you want.

1:34:28.767 --> 1:34:30.166
-This again?

1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:34.567
-Tell me who you are
and what you want.

1:34:40.333 --> 1:34:43.133
-I suppose I've forgotten.

1:34:43.166 --> 1:34:45.233
You travel through
so many bodies,

1:34:45.266 --> 1:34:47.100
you start to lose track.

1:34:49.066 --> 1:34:50.533
Sorry to disappoint.

1:34:52.633 --> 1:34:55.166
-Tell me who you are
and what you want!

1:35:04.600 --> 1:35:06.333
-Are you not listening?

1:35:12.033 --> 1:35:16.667
-Tell me who you are
and what you want!

1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:18.800
-Really?

1:35:20.300 --> 1:35:21.767
You want to know?

1:35:21.800 --> 1:35:24.567
You want to know what I want?

1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:26.333
-Begin the ritual!

1:35:34.300 --> 1:35:35.533
-Now...

1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:46.400
If I leave Leah in here,

1:35:46.433 --> 1:35:49.367
then she is the one stuck
in the circle.

1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:50.667
She'll die.

1:35:53.433 --> 1:35:55.367
Or...

1:35:55.400 --> 1:35:58.800
...you stop the ritual,
in which case, you all die.

1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:02.667
Either way...

1:36:02.700 --> 1:36:05.033
...I get what I want.

1:36:09.300 --> 1:36:11.367
So, well done.

1:36:11.400 --> 1:36:13.767
I couldn't have done it
by myself.

1:36:15.667 --> 1:36:17.200
So long.

1:36:49.233 --> 1:36:51.033
Mum?

1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:53.500
Maja?

1:36:58.467 --> 1:36:59.700
What's going on?

1:37:02.633 --> 1:37:04.667
Maja, what...

1:37:04.700 --> 1:37:08.066
-No! Don't move!

1:37:08.100 --> 1:37:10.533
Don't move. Just stay there.

1:37:10.567 --> 1:37:13.333
-What's going on?
Why can't I move?

1:37:18.300 --> 1:37:20.767
Mummy, you're scaring me.
What's happening?

1:37:22.567 --> 1:37:26.166
No. Stop it.

1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:29.100
Stop it!

1:37:29.133 --> 1:37:30.333
-Hey!

1:37:31.700 --> 1:37:33.066
-Mum?

1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:50.333
-It's okay.

1:37:52.467 --> 1:37:53.800
It's okay.

1:37:59.633 --> 1:38:01.000
It's okay.

1:38:12.100 --> 1:38:15.000
It's gonna be all right.
-Mum?

1:38:54.066 --> 1:38:55.633
-Mum? Mum? Mum?

1:38:58.433 --> 1:38:59.734
Mum?

1:39:01.300 --> 1:39:03.500
Mum? Mum?

1:39:06.066 --> 1:39:07.300
Mum?

1:39:33.700 --> 1:39:37.233
-All right, we're ready to go.
-Sorry. Let me get that.

1:39:37.266 --> 1:39:39.700
No, it's fine. Just...

1:39:39.734 --> 1:39:41.200
Just leave it.

1:39:41.233 --> 1:39:43.100
I didn't bring any of her stuff.

1:39:44.533 --> 1:39:47.100
Just like you asked me to,
but I...

1:39:48.300 --> 1:39:51.200
I actually... I found...

1:39:57.467 --> 1:39:59.433
Why?

1:39:59.467 --> 1:40:01.200
-Because it's funny.

1:40:02.166 --> 1:40:04.633
-So...
-Yeah, I'm being avoidant.

1:40:04.667 --> 1:40:06.133
Trying to.
You're not helping.

1:40:06.166 --> 1:40:09.300
So, let's just laugh
at my hilarious joke

1:40:09.333 --> 1:40:10.633
and get going.

1:40:13.233 --> 1:40:14.500
-I...

1:40:19.100 --> 1:40:20.467
I found this.

1:40:22.734 --> 1:40:24.467
-She'd be so annoyed if...

1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.633
She must have been so upset
when she found it.

1:40:36.166 --> 1:40:39.200
Ugh! I hate that I treated her
like such a nuisance.

1:40:47.333 --> 1:40:49.400
-You know, I really think...
-Are we safe?

1:40:54.800 --> 1:40:56.467
-Yeah.

1:40:57.633 --> 1:40:59.033
Hey...

1:41:03.133 --> 1:41:06.500
I promise. Okay?
I saw it leave you.

1:41:15.333 --> 1:41:17.500
-It's gonna be okay.
-Mm-hmm.

1:41:26.567 --> 1:41:29.100
-Are you sure you don't want
to go back inside?

1:41:29.133 --> 1:41:31.166
Just one last time? Okay.
-I'm sure.

1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:33.333
Let's just go.
-All right.

1:41:36.800 --> 1:41:38.533
I'll drop off the keys.

1:41:39.633 --> 1:41:44.000
Oh, and also,
I'm confiscating this.

1:41:45.433 --> 1:41:47.033
It's not a toy.

1:42:29.500 --> 1:42:32.500
