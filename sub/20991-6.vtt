00:08.400 --> 00:10.720
You should fear the sword yourselves;

00:11.039 --> 00:13.960
for wrath will bring punishment
by the sword,

00:14.279 --> 00:17.519
and then you will know
that there is judgment. (Job 19:29)

00:36.600 --> 00:38.320
Go! Go!

01:23.599 --> 01:27.480
I'm sorry to bother you
but the circumstances are exceptional.

01:27.560 --> 01:30.920
- What is it?
- The manager of your hotel is missing.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.920
- Pardon?
- His flat was cleared out.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.519
Please report it to the police.
I dismissed him after you left my hotel.

01:40.079 --> 01:43.280
- Can you tell me anything about him?
- Like what?

01:44.079 --> 01:47.439
- How long did he work for you?
- More than two years.

01:47.519 --> 01:50.120
- Did you notice anything disturbing?
- No.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.760
He was recommended by a reliable source.
If you'll excuse me...

01:53.840 --> 01:56.359
- Recommended by whom?
- Tomek Nawrot.

02:02.159 --> 02:05.079
- We've got only 15 minutes.
- We'll make it.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.799
I hope so.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.759
Mr Nawrot!

02:16.680 --> 02:19.000
Mr Editor? What a surprise.

02:19.319 --> 02:21.639
Have you been waiting here for me?

02:22.280 --> 02:24.800
I'd like to talk to you for a second.

02:25.120 --> 02:28.240
Here? Now? I have an important meeting.

02:28.599 --> 02:32.719
What you did for Skalski
needed a lot of courage.

02:34.639 --> 02:36.759
Let's not exaggerate.

02:37.080 --> 02:40.199
At the TV studio,
what was really your point?

02:41.599 --> 02:45.120
You said the party would start.
What party exactly?

02:46.159 --> 02:48.800
You know, I really need to go now.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.680
- But how about lunch tomorrow?
- Lunch?

02:56.319 --> 02:58.840
I have an offer for you.

03:08.599 --> 03:11.520
starring

03:27.479 --> 03:29.599
music by

03:36.199 --> 03:38.240
photography by

03:44.280 --> 03:46.599
written by

03:49.000 --> 03:51.240
directed by

03:52.240 --> 03:54.560
THE PACT

03:56.599 --> 03:59.120
EPISODE 6: JUDGEMENT DAY

04:48.839 --> 04:52.360
During the procession
attended by a few hundred people,

04:52.680 --> 04:56.399
a young woman was stabbed in the belly
and died instantly.

04:57.639 --> 05:00.040
Who did we send there?

05:00.120 --> 05:02.040
- Agata.
- Good.

05:02.439 --> 05:06.959
We have unofficial information
about a man in a leather jacket.

05:07.319 --> 05:09.839
He was allegedly seen near the woman...

05:10.519 --> 05:13.160
Andrzej was right: someone conned us.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.199
The guy vanished.
Someone's covering up their tracks.

05:17.519 --> 05:20.240
I won't help you. Handle it on your own.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.319
- Can't you see it's all linked?
- What is?

05:24.639 --> 05:28.759
We'll check it out once more.
Quietly or we'll fail again.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.720
...show you a video
from one of our viewers...

05:33.040 --> 05:35.360
You listening to me at all?

05:36.199 --> 05:38.319
...a procession participant.

05:44.439 --> 05:47.560
- It's Piotrek!
- Fuck! That's all we need.

05:49.079 --> 05:50.720
Bloody hell.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.680
- Impossible.
- I knew he'd get us into some shit.

05:53.759 --> 05:56.439
- We'll cut off from him.
- You don't think...

05:56.519 --> 05:58.600
Doesn't matter what I think!

05:58.680 --> 06:02.199
'A Kurier reporter kills'
will pop up on the news ticker!

06:02.600 --> 06:05.120
All we can do is minimize the losses.

06:12.759 --> 06:15.639
We'll say he broke down
after his brother's death.

06:15.720 --> 06:18.439
We tried to help him
but he refused treatment.

06:19.079 --> 06:22.680
He got nervous and violent.
And we dismissed him yesterday.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.759
- You want to use him?
- No. You will.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.199
Pardon?

06:28.720 --> 06:31.360
We can't afford two scandals in one day.

06:31.680 --> 06:36.000
You got us into the minister shit
so you'll help clean this one!

06:36.720 --> 06:38.639
Sorry.

06:40.120 --> 06:45.160
Yesterday, the management board asked me
who should take Andrzej's place.

06:45.240 --> 06:47.759
Guess who I recommended.

06:48.199 --> 06:51.519
You don't want me
to change my mind, do you?

06:53.079 --> 06:57.879
You do what you have to do
to get what you want. Simple as that.

07:00.519 --> 07:02.120
Monika!

07:56.560 --> 07:58.759
What's wrong?

07:59.120 --> 08:02.040
Piotr? What are you talking about?

08:06.879 --> 08:09.079
I don't believe it.

08:10.879 --> 08:12.920
I just don't.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.159
Sir, there's someone for you.

09:41.600 --> 09:45.120
We're the police.
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.440
Have you found him?

09:48.799 --> 09:52.600
- It concerns my grandson, correct?
- No. Your son.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.919
- What do you want from him?
- Do you know where he is?

09:58.240 --> 10:01.159
Wait a minute... What is it about?

10:05.679 --> 10:08.399
It's about this. Please, take a look.

10:16.039 --> 10:19.159
Your son is suspected
of committing a murder.

10:19.480 --> 10:22.000
What are you trying to frame him in?

10:22.320 --> 10:24.759
- We just want to help.
- Help?

10:25.279 --> 10:27.279
Easy, easy!

10:27.759 --> 10:29.879
Let go of me.

14:37.039 --> 14:39.159
My name is Piotr Grodecki.

14:39.480 --> 14:43.799
Today, I witnessed the death
of a CBI agent: Weronika Zawadzka.

14:45.440 --> 14:49.559
She was killed by the same people
who are responsible for the deaths

14:49.879 --> 14:53.600
of Grzegorz Merta, Adrian Bogusz,
and Daniel Grodecki.

14:53.960 --> 14:57.480
The same people abducted my nephew,
Kuba Grodecki.

14:57.799 --> 15:01.519
They did it to protect the conspiracy
they participate in.

15:04.120 --> 15:07.159
So far, they thought
they were untouchable.

15:07.480 --> 15:10.120
I'm recording this statement
to change it.

15:10.919 --> 15:15.159
When Weronika Zawadzka discovered
the evidence of their crimes...

15:22.600 --> 15:25.120
She was murdered.

15:30.720 --> 15:33.240
Holy Saturday

16:02.480 --> 16:04.879
I'd like to ask you a favour.

16:09.039 --> 16:13.480
I wanted you to be the one
who'd hear my confession.

16:16.240 --> 16:20.159
Because it's going to be
my last confession.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.919
What are you talking about?

16:25.799 --> 16:28.240
A sinner like me

16:29.840 --> 16:32.360
doesn't deserve to be forgiven.

16:32.679 --> 16:34.919
Please, calm down.

16:35.240 --> 16:37.960
You can confess your sins now.

16:44.279 --> 16:46.799
I didn't love my son.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.360
I didn't love Daniel.

17:45.079 --> 17:49.200
Paweł Walczak and his son Kamil
were killed on July 20th 2013.

17:49.519 --> 17:52.839
The Pact members carried on
with their business.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.440
So far, they thought
they were untouchable.

17:56.519 --> 17:59.440
I'm recording this statement
to change it.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.640
You must take it to the police.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.880
He has Kuba.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.920
Who?

18:29.759 --> 18:31.680
Nawrot.

18:32.640 --> 18:35.039
What makes you think it's him?

18:35.359 --> 18:37.480
He shot that film.

18:37.839 --> 18:40.039
How do you know?

18:42.319 --> 18:46.039
Weronika found his reflection
in the video.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.799
I'm supposed to meet him today.

18:55.559 --> 18:58.680
After he brought the audio
to the TV station,

19:00.359 --> 19:03.279
Monika and I got back
to our investigation.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.559
When's the meeting?

19:37.480 --> 19:41.799
- Maybe I'll go with you?
- Don't move. Give me two minutes.

20:00.640 --> 20:03.079
In Oslo, things are going as planned.

20:03.160 --> 20:06.440
The briefing is at 1 p.m.
You meet the team at 3 p.m.

20:06.519 --> 20:11.200
- If you'll just sign here, Minister.
- I'm no longer a minister. What's this?

20:11.279 --> 20:15.640
An annexe to confirm you're a negotiator
on behalf of the government.

20:15.720 --> 20:20.440
We must send it to the PM Chancellery.
It's already initialled by the PM.

20:20.759 --> 20:23.200
- Is that all?
- Almost.

20:23.519 --> 20:26.240
- Someone would like to meet you.
- Who?

20:27.279 --> 20:29.920
She's waiting by the side entrance.

20:31.039 --> 20:33.160
- See you soon.
- Good luck!

22:41.079 --> 22:43.720
Hi, it's me. We have to meet now.

22:44.319 --> 22:45.759
All right.

23:06.759 --> 23:09.279
Piotruś, what's going on?

23:09.880 --> 23:14.160
- They're framing me.
- Fuck, I can guess that much. Who is?

23:14.240 --> 23:16.759
The less you know, the better.

23:23.480 --> 23:26.200
OK, how can I help you?

23:28.680 --> 23:31.039
This is all I've got.

23:31.119 --> 23:34.799
If I don't call you until midnight,
upload it onto the Net.

23:34.880 --> 23:38.359
- Send it to all the media.
- You're kidding me?

23:38.440 --> 23:41.640
Until then,
I don't think you should watch it.

23:49.440 --> 23:52.160
One more thing. I need your car.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.839
You fucking know what you're doing?

23:58.200 --> 24:00.319
Are you sure?

24:00.640 --> 24:03.759
And I know someone who might help me.

28:14.200 --> 28:16.599
We're sorry about this.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.359
It's time to join forces.

28:19.880 --> 28:23.720
- We have her call records.
- You were often in touch recently.

28:24.079 --> 28:26.160
It's personal.

28:26.240 --> 28:30.880
Shit! The girl's dead.
It's time we started helping each other.

28:31.799 --> 28:34.319
You want to interrogate me?

28:34.680 --> 28:37.200
So stick to the protocol.

28:57.720 --> 29:00.039
I know it was you.

29:00.359 --> 29:03.279
No, there was no talk of killing anyone.

29:03.599 --> 29:05.720
Not Weronika.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.440
No, you listen to me.

29:10.519 --> 29:12.960
You're going to pay for that.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.359
- What's next?
- I don't know.

29:38.920 --> 29:43.440
- Maybe some holidays?
- Sure. You'll go back straight to work.

29:44.680 --> 29:46.880
It's been a long week.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.720
I'm glad you're here with me.

29:53.079 --> 29:55.200
You've won.

30:38.559 --> 30:41.079
What are you doing here?

30:42.759 --> 30:46.680
- I was supposed to meet Andrzej.
- So where is he now?

30:47.319 --> 30:49.720
How should I know?

30:52.480 --> 30:56.079
Your face pops up everywhere today.
What's going on?

30:56.720 --> 31:00.039
Are you hungry?
Shall I order something for you?

31:00.359 --> 31:04.279
They have exquisite beef.
It flies from Dijon once a week.

31:04.640 --> 31:06.960
Every Saturday at 9 a.m.

31:07.279 --> 31:10.000
On Holy Saturday, it tastes the best.

31:14.799 --> 31:19.119
You're gonna tell me what's going on?
Or should I make a guess?

31:19.440 --> 31:21.880
My nephew's been abducted.

31:23.119 --> 31:25.799
- Daniel's son?
- Now Andrzej's vanished.

31:25.880 --> 31:29.559
- Does it mean anything to you?
- Should it?

31:29.640 --> 31:32.160
You won't get away with this.

31:32.480 --> 31:36.079
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

31:37.119 --> 31:39.559
You don't?

31:49.839 --> 31:52.960
You're as blind
as your colleagues from Kurier.

31:53.279 --> 31:57.519
- I'll fucking kill you.
- You're barking up the wrong tree.

31:57.839 --> 32:00.480
I'm not the one you're looking for.

32:00.799 --> 32:03.319
Tell me what you know.

32:07.799 --> 32:09.920
Daniel, Adrian...

32:10.240 --> 32:12.359
Grzegorz, Paweł...

32:12.720 --> 32:15.359
They killed themselves or went missing.

32:15.440 --> 32:18.160
Too much of a coincidence
not to link them.

32:18.920 --> 32:21.960
- You did business together.
- A long time ago.

32:22.039 --> 32:23.960
A very long time ago.

32:24.720 --> 32:29.279
- I made my money and went my way.
- And they let you go so easily?

32:29.359 --> 32:32.240
I knew their sins, they knew mine.
Fair deal.

32:32.319 --> 32:35.559
They're still in this together
and you're not, right?

32:35.640 --> 32:37.480
I don't know.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.079
There must be some fuck-up.

32:40.160 --> 32:43.079
- Because he's killing them one by one.
- Who?

32:47.319 --> 32:49.839
The guy had a compass that broke down.

32:50.160 --> 32:53.400
But I promised him
he'd pay for everything.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.960
But you...
I'm a bit scared of you right now.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.799
Who is it?

33:00.440 --> 33:03.240
He recruited us for the Konary centre.

33:03.799 --> 33:06.119
Show me this fucker!

33:10.200 --> 33:12.839
He's not here.

33:13.880 --> 33:16.599
Because he took this photo.

33:17.920 --> 33:20.240
Who?

33:21.000 --> 33:23.319
Search.

33:27.519 --> 33:29.200
Yes?

33:29.279 --> 33:31.319
It's your colleague.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.319
Yes, Monika?

33:35.160 --> 33:36.880
What?

33:38.200 --> 33:41.519
I didn't know
that anything happened to Skalski.

33:41.839 --> 33:43.960
- Hello, Monika?
- Piotr?

33:44.279 --> 33:46.440
Are you with Nawrot?

33:46.519 --> 33:49.640
- What's going on?
- What's wrong with Skalski?

33:52.079 --> 33:54.799
...and hit the government car...

33:55.119 --> 33:56.839
Hold on.

33:57.200 --> 34:00.039
The limousine's driver died on the spot.

34:00.119 --> 34:04.599
The passengers of the smashed car
were ex-minister Dariusz Skalski

34:04.680 --> 34:07.799
and Iwona Bogusz, who accompanied him.

35:02.639 --> 35:05.840
They fucking killed him
in broad daylight.

35:12.960 --> 35:15.880
Who gave you a tip-off on Skalski?

35:17.599 --> 35:20.519
The hotel manager but he's a pawn.

35:20.840 --> 35:23.679
He's vanished anyway.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.159
It's the same with Skalski.

35:26.239 --> 35:29.760
They failed to disgrace him
so they got rid of him.

35:32.239 --> 35:34.840
What's the stake in their game?

35:35.199 --> 35:37.800
Was Skalski dismissed by the PM?

35:38.719 --> 35:41.440
Almost. He was to stay as a negotiator.

35:41.800 --> 35:44.519
The treaty. Our energy security.

35:45.440 --> 35:50.360
Skalski was trying to push through
a regulation that didn't suit them.

35:54.599 --> 35:56.719
What now?

35:57.719 --> 36:00.119
Now we'll go for a drive. Come on.

36:24.960 --> 36:28.280
- Watch this guy.
- Meaning what?

37:30.679 --> 37:33.119
What's going on?

37:35.280 --> 37:38.000
You thought I wouldn't find out.

37:39.119 --> 37:41.519
What are you talking about?

37:44.559 --> 37:47.000
It's your fault she was killed.

37:47.519 --> 37:49.599
Are you mad?

37:49.679 --> 37:52.880
Did it take you long
to make her paranoid?

37:53.199 --> 37:57.920
I was trying to protect her.
But you dragged her into that again.

38:03.679 --> 38:06.599
Who did you call outside the morgue?

38:08.679 --> 38:11.599
- Sorry?
- Give me your mobile.

38:20.039 --> 38:22.360
The other one, for fuck's sake!

38:27.119 --> 38:29.159
It's not what you think.

38:29.480 --> 38:33.000
If you make this call now,
you'll screw up everything.

38:33.320 --> 38:37.039
We're conducting an inquiry
against them. Weronika asked me...

38:37.559 --> 38:40.400
Stop lying! You fucking hear me?!

38:44.639 --> 38:46.880
I really didn't know.

38:47.199 --> 38:49.920
I didn't know they would do it.

38:53.199 --> 38:55.119
Who?

39:00.119 --> 39:03.039
These were supposed to be scams only.

39:04.920 --> 39:07.360
I just gave him information.

39:11.639 --> 39:13.760
For years.

39:15.639 --> 39:18.559
I didn't know he was capable of that.

39:19.280 --> 39:21.199
Who?!

40:01.679 --> 40:03.639
Excuse me!

40:03.719 --> 40:06.239
Do you know where the post office is?

40:09.079 --> 40:12.599
- What's wrong? Can I help you?
- No, thank you.

40:16.679 --> 40:19.000
Where did you get it?

40:19.320 --> 40:23.800
We knew she was at the Central Station.
We saw her on the CCTV footage.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.199
What about Andrzej?

40:27.840 --> 40:31.360
He used her key. We had to detain him.

40:32.039 --> 40:34.360
Call Andrzej.

40:59.960 --> 41:02.280
I'll call a taxi.

41:21.039 --> 41:23.239
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.

41:23.599 --> 41:25.719
Is everything OK?

41:26.800 --> 41:28.599
Good.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.559
Listen, don't tell them anything.

41:32.280 --> 41:34.800
Don't tell them anything for now.

41:36.079 --> 41:38.480
Piotr, I'll help you.

41:38.800 --> 41:42.320
- Spare your effort.
- You won't get it done by yourself.

41:44.320 --> 41:46.840
Piotr, I know what steps to take.

41:47.639 --> 41:51.159
Please, let me finish this properly.
For Weronika.

42:14.639 --> 42:16.840
I know who you are.

42:20.920 --> 42:23.159
Fine. Let's do it.

44:14.840 --> 44:17.760
- Fancy a drink?
- Where's Kuba?

44:18.480 --> 44:20.719
No foreplay?

44:24.639 --> 44:26.960
He's safe.

44:45.079 --> 44:47.719
Let's start over. Where's Kuba?

44:50.639 --> 44:53.599
How should I know
you didn't make a copy?

44:53.679 --> 44:55.760
I did. More than one.

44:55.840 --> 44:59.199
If anything happens to my family,
all will be revealed.

44:59.280 --> 45:01.840
And otherwise you'll just shut up?

45:01.920 --> 45:04.239
Not your style, huh?

45:17.119 --> 45:19.320
Let the boy go.

45:20.920 --> 45:23.039
Come here.

45:32.880 --> 45:35.400
It's only business, nothing more.

45:36.239 --> 45:40.000
If Daniel had seen things this way,
nothing would have happened.

45:40.079 --> 45:43.519
- Like what?
- Everything. Kids, fires, Abrahams.

45:44.880 --> 45:49.000
It was Daniel. I wouldn't have come up
with such an idea.

45:49.519 --> 45:52.000
- What's this bollocks?
- It's true.

45:52.079 --> 45:55.800
When Nawrot got the fuck out,
the group had to be disciplined.

45:56.920 --> 46:00.840
And then your brother came up
with that whole Pact idea.

46:01.159 --> 46:03.599
Kids as a guarantee of loyalty.

46:03.920 --> 46:06.360
It was either you or your child.

46:07.639 --> 46:09.559
A work of genius.

46:11.320 --> 46:13.960
Daniel wouldn't have done that.

46:15.559 --> 46:18.679
You keep implying we wanted to do that.

46:19.840 --> 46:22.199
Why can't you fucking get it?

46:22.280 --> 46:26.199
No one wants to burn their friend's kid
during a long weekend.

46:26.519 --> 46:30.239
But when the motivation is down,
you need a new stimulus.

46:30.559 --> 46:34.280
And Daniel, with his religious frenzy,
had a brilliant idea.

46:34.639 --> 46:39.039
The stake was to be horrific
to avoid another Nawrot story.

46:42.840 --> 46:45.480
And yet something went fucking wrong.

46:45.800 --> 46:50.119
Sometimes you can't just talk.
Sometimes you need to make a show.

46:50.760 --> 46:53.480
Did Daniel know
you were going to do that?

46:53.800 --> 46:56.199
He caught up as we went along.

46:56.559 --> 46:58.480
So he didn't.

46:58.800 --> 47:01.000
He came up with that.

47:01.360 --> 47:06.079
But it's one thing to have an idea
and another to see it come to life.

47:06.400 --> 47:09.519
I respect him for staying with us
until the end.

47:10.599 --> 47:14.440
It must have excited him.
It must excite you too, huh?

47:14.519 --> 47:16.960
Your daddy messed with your heads...

50:39.679 --> 50:42.400
Easter Sunday

50:51.760 --> 50:56.880
The Central Bureau of Investigation
has detained five Warsaw businessmen.

50:57.800 --> 51:02.119
Charges have already been brought
against all of them.

51:04.440 --> 51:08.320
This success is the result
of the CBI operation.

51:08.400 --> 51:12.719
The CBI conducted an inquiry
against the group for a long time.

51:13.039 --> 51:17.960
The evidence is being collected,
so this is all I can say at the moment.

51:18.280 --> 51:22.519
But I hope the details of our operation
will be revealed soon.

51:22.840 --> 51:25.559
Then, you'll learn all the facts.

51:25.880 --> 51:30.800
Do you know what links this case
with yesterday's murder of Mr Derenda?

51:31.239 --> 51:35.440
Please, do not anticipate
the findings of the investigation.

51:36.480 --> 51:40.960
For now, there's no reason
to link this death to our investigation.

51:41.039 --> 51:43.159
This is all for today.

51:43.679 --> 51:45.840
Thank you very much.

51:45.920 --> 51:48.239
Goodbye, thank you.

53:45.920 --> 53:48.440
