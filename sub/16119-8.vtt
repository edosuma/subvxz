09:54.962 --> 09:57.097
Me, neither.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.399
I can't help you, man.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.334
Come on, man,
you literally just

10:01.368 --> 10:02.402
let me out of here.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.436
Remember, we did the--

10:03.470 --> 10:04.938
fist bump and everything

10:04.972 --> 10:07.274
and none of that
don't mean shit to you?

10:12.312 --> 10:14.014
Okay.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.785
This is meaningless.

10:22.956 --> 10:26.626
(Dreezy's "Body"
featuring Jeremih playing)

10:26.660 --> 10:28.796
CHRIS:
Let me get a Hennessy.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.330
You want something?

10:30.363 --> 10:31.598
Laphroaig.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.033
Damn.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.868
You really going
for my pockets, huh?

10:34.902 --> 10:36.636
I earned it.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.144
-Thanks, honey.
-Thank you.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.213
Cheers.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.452
* Yo body on my body, baby

10:52.485 --> 10:56.857
* I'm about to catch
a body in here baby *

10:56.890 --> 10:59.326
-The fuck?
-(laughing)

10:59.359 --> 11:01.862
I'm sorry,
but that was awesome.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.064
You saw--you saw that, right?

11:04.097 --> 11:05.899
-Yes.
-Fuck, he--

11:05.933 --> 11:07.500
WOMAN:
It's hilarious.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.002
You should see
your face right now.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.371
(laughs)

11:11.404 --> 11:12.472
Thank you.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.007
Thanks--you're awesome.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.008
Thank you for--

11:15.042 --> 11:16.910
for being awesome.

11:16.944 --> 11:18.846
Love it.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.757
Relax.

11:29.790 --> 11:33.526
You ain't got to
get so sensitive.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.729
I hate shots.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.835
I hate the club.
I hate...

11:41.869 --> 11:45.005
people at the club.
I hate--

11:45.038 --> 11:47.908
This shit is pointless,
it's like a money suck.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.444
Can I give you
some advice?

11:51.478 --> 11:53.346
Sure.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.083
Leave.
No one is keeping you here.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.285
But if you're at the club,
that means you deep down

11:58.318 --> 12:00.087
want to be at the club.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.756
You're not special.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.699
To be fair,

12:12.732 --> 12:15.268
you don't look the usual type.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.304
What's the usual type?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.343
That guy.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.715
MAN:
Excuse me, sir. Sir.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.483
You need to move up out of here.
We don't do that in here.

12:30.517 --> 12:31.919
-Rubbing your nipples and shit.
-(laughs)

12:31.952 --> 12:33.987
-Come on, man, get outta here.
-(laughs)

12:37.958 --> 12:39.159
ALFRED: Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.061
-So you hit his car?
-Uh, yeah.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.163
-No--
-I had to.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.798
So then I go back
and sit in my car...

12:44.832 --> 12:46.299
-Uh-huh.
-And I'm crying.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.567
-Well, fake crying.
-(laughs)

12:47.600 --> 12:49.136
(both laugh)

12:49.169 --> 12:51.071
And the guy comes up to me
and he's like,

12:51.104 --> 12:53.773
(as man) "Damn, I was gonna
let you go, baby girl,

12:53.807 --> 12:55.275
but my car's fucked up!"

12:55.308 --> 12:57.477
Oh, no.
No--no, you know what?

12:57.510 --> 12:59.779
-Whatever to that nigga, man.
-Whatever.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.081
-Hey you want to get a photo?
-Mm-hmm.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.315
-Let's get a phot--
Hey, hey!

13:02.349 --> 13:03.350
Hey, hey!
Nigga, hey, hey, hey,

13:03.383 --> 13:04.985
where you going, Ansel Adams?

13:05.018 --> 13:06.253
Man, you don't want to get
a exclusive photo

13:06.286 --> 13:09.456
of Team Paper Boi?

13:09.489 --> 13:10.824
No, I'm good, man.

13:10.858 --> 13:14.094
Wait.
Man, look.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.998
You sure?

13:18.031 --> 13:20.367
Marcus Miles got
his pet peacock here tonight.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.701
And it's got
a leather jacket on.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.304
That's front-page news.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.873
Nice shoes, bro.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.674
(shutter clicks)

13:29.309 --> 13:33.146
(laughs)

13:33.180 --> 13:34.314
Yeah, man.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.183
To that nigga, man?
Whatever man.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.051
Hell, let's--
let's toast it up, man.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.653
-Yeah.
-Toast it up.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.057
BARTENDER: See, he's tell them
some bullshit about

13:44.091 --> 13:47.394
how VIP is at capacity
but he can hook them up.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.862
See,
there are four of them,

13:48.896 --> 13:51.398
but he says he
only has two wristbands.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.665
See, if only two go,

13:52.699 --> 13:53.867
they feel special.

13:53.901 --> 13:57.037
They have a better time.
(chuckles)

13:57.070 --> 13:59.739
Everyone needs to
feel special sometimes.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.308
even if it's
some janky nigga

14:01.341 --> 14:03.710
telling your two friends
they can't come in.

14:03.743 --> 14:06.079
Why do you think porn exists?

14:06.113 --> 14:08.581
Wow.

14:08.615 --> 14:11.651
You were Marxist
until you got kind of sexist.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.053
(scoffs)

14:21.394 --> 14:22.662
Then why am--

14:22.695 --> 14:24.764
why am I here?
Tell me that.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.699
The same reason
everyone else is here.

14:26.733 --> 14:29.002
To feel good
about yourself and stunt.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.337
(imitates buzzer)
Wrong.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.538
I'm here for work.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.340
Exactly.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.841
You want to make more money
to feel good about yourself

14:34.874 --> 14:36.209
like everyone else.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.911
And you're stunting
by playing like,

14:37.945 --> 14:40.313
"Oh, I came here to handle
business like a boss."

14:42.615 --> 14:45.552
No...no.

14:45.585 --> 14:46.553
No--

14:46.586 --> 14:48.021
Don't be an asshole.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.423
Okay?
You asked.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.392
(scoffs)

14:52.425 --> 14:54.061
All right, then,
I guess I'll...

14:54.094 --> 14:56.930
just take the check,
Tiresias.

15:08.175 --> 15:11.744
You better tip.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.913
Hey, Ken.
What's up, hon?

15:13.947 --> 15:16.116
You want the regular?

15:21.854 --> 15:23.490
Fire alarm.

15:26.026 --> 15:28.996
(slow club music)

15:29.029 --> 15:35.969
*

15:46.046 --> 15:52.986
*

15:57.724 --> 16:00.660
(muffled club music)

16:17.310 --> 16:18.545
That nigga called
the cops on me.

16:18.578 --> 16:19.879
What?

16:19.912 --> 16:21.514
And that wasn't even
the crazy part.

16:21.548 --> 16:22.849
-Oh, come on.
-Then he goes,

16:22.882 --> 16:25.485
"Oh, shit, my gun,"
runs back to his car

16:25.518 --> 16:26.986
and stashes it
in the bushes.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.688
Damn, girl,
you wasn't scared?

16:28.721 --> 16:29.856
Scared for what?

16:29.889 --> 16:31.658
The cops was on their way.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.226
I straight
told on his ass.

16:33.260 --> 16:36.863
(laughs)

16:36.896 --> 16:38.698
Oh, I was just gonna
top you off, big dog.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.400
No, no, no,
I--I can top myself off, dude.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.369
-I got you.
-I can top myself off, man!

16:42.402 --> 16:44.003
Who the hell are you?

16:44.037 --> 16:45.405
I'm a promoter, man.
Well, actually--actually,

16:45.438 --> 16:46.573
I'm a rapper from Harlem,
you know.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.341
You know A$AP Rocky?
A lil' back?

16:48.375 --> 16:50.243
Well, I don't know
any of them, but--

16:50.277 --> 16:52.045
I went to school with Janice.
Yeah, man.

16:52.079 --> 16:54.414
Yo, I got--I got a CD
that's about to drop, too, man.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.682
I got like four
followers on MySpace...

16:55.715 --> 16:58.618
(voices blur indistinctly)

17:00.620 --> 17:03.556
(club sounds blur indistinctly)

17:04.691 --> 17:06.226

17:06.259 --> 17:08.195
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
He cool, man, he with me.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.563
Nigga, who are you?

17:10.597 --> 17:12.699
Hey.
Hey!

17:12.732 --> 17:13.866
All you niggas,

17:13.900 --> 17:15.502

of my section!

17:15.535 --> 17:16.536
WOMAN: Excuse me?

17:16.569 --> 17:19.239
ALFRED:
Get up, let's go!

17:19.272 --> 17:20.440

17:22.041 --> 17:23.676

17:23.710 --> 17:25.745
Come on back here.
(chuckles)

17:25.778 --> 17:27.347
Okay, girl,
let's go.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.182
'Cause Marcus Miles'
section is over there

17:29.216 --> 17:30.283
with the bottles.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.518
No.
No-no-no-no-no,

17:31.551 --> 17:32.752
I'm bout to get bottles
right now.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.621
Hey, hey!
Sweetheart!

17:34.654 --> 17:36.123
Yeah, over here.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.191
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen,

17:38.225 --> 17:40.360
Marcus Miles
has just bought

17:40.393 --> 17:42.795
the entire bar tonight!

17:42.829 --> 17:46.266
(cheers and applause)

17:46.299 --> 17:49.636
So we will no longer
be serving drinks.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.037
all: What?

17:51.070 --> 17:52.772
He owns all the liquor
in the club,

17:52.805 --> 17:55.575
and, uh,
I think he's leaving.

17:55.608 --> 17:56.576
(crowd murmuring)

17:56.609 --> 17:58.711
So...

17:58.745 --> 18:01.648
(indistinct talking)

18:06.353 --> 18:09.956
MAN:(laughs)
You broke!

18:11.658 --> 18:13.660
(lighter clicks)
No, I could hook it up.

18:13.693 --> 18:17.830
(R&B music over radio)

18:17.864 --> 18:21.668
Bro, what are you doing
in here?

18:21.701 --> 18:24.036
I want m--

18:27.707 --> 18:28.841
I want my money.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.578
I want my $5,000.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.247
Oh, you mean your $750?

18:34.281 --> 18:36.249
W--what?

18:36.283 --> 18:37.617
Let me explain
something to you.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.018
You know what it takes
to run a club?

18:39.051 --> 18:40.753
The expenses?

18:40.787 --> 18:43.990
Well, let's do some math.

18:44.023 --> 18:46.859
We paid for the flyers.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.628
And then your boy
exceeded his

18:48.661 --> 18:50.330
alcohol order limit.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.764
(gags)

18:51.798 --> 18:53.466
And then we had to pay for
extra security

18:53.500 --> 18:55.168
because Paper Boi's
a thug

18:55.202 --> 18:57.270
and that's not cheap.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.806
And then,
he was supposed to perform.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.374
-What? No.
-Yeah.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.776
He was supposed to perform.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.612
So all in all,
you guys get

19:05.645 --> 19:09.382
$750.
And that's me being nice.

19:09.416 --> 19:10.983
Nigga, that wasn't
the deal, man--

19:11.017 --> 19:12.785
Hey, don't start that
with me, motherfucker,

19:12.819 --> 19:14.187
'cause I don't play that shit.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.688
That's what I'm paying you.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.290
Now, you better
check your tone

19:17.324 --> 19:19.492
and get the fuck up
out of my office

19:19.526 --> 19:21.160
before I go
get the heater.

19:23.029 --> 19:27.166
* I don't care
No one to love me *

19:27.200 --> 19:33.306
* I don't care
No one to think of me *

19:33.340 --> 19:39.379
* I don't care
no one *

19:39.412 --> 19:42.081
Damn, this shit lame.
(scoffs)

19:42.114 --> 19:44.384
It ain't even
2:00 a.m. yet.

19:44.417 --> 19:47.654
-Yeah, this is so wack.
-(chuckles)

19:47.687 --> 19:49.489
(sighs)

19:49.522 --> 19:52.525
But at least it wasn't
a complete loss.

19:52.559 --> 19:55.262
I met a cool-ass nigga.

19:55.295 --> 19:59.165
Me?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.634
Well, hold up, okay?
Hold up, baby.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.505
(chuckles)

20:05.538 --> 20:07.274
(line trills)

20:07.307 --> 20:08.541
(phone rings)

20:08.575 --> 20:10.209
(video game playing over TV)

20:10.243 --> 20:11.411
Yo.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.845
Hey.
Hey, man, were you go?

20:12.879 --> 20:14.347
We leaving.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.915
Yo, I'm already
at the crib, bro.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.418
ALFRED: What?
-Mm-hmm.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.952
They said I had on the wrong
color wristband

20:19.986 --> 20:21.053
or something.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.789
Now I'm on this Zoo Tycoon.

20:22.822 --> 20:26.359
Nigerians.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.794
Hey, hey, Janice--hey.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.061
Hey, man, let me call you back,
all right?

20:29.095 --> 20:30.763
DARIUS: Yep.

20:30.797 --> 20:33.366
