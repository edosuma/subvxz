WEBVTT

00:02.934 --> 00:03.467
- Tonight, on the Below Deck

00:03.467 --> 00:03.767
- Tonight, on the Below Deck
Season 6 Reunion.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.800
- I was in the corner
that whole time.

00:07.834 --> 00:08.834
- You cornered me.

00:08.867 --> 00:09.967
- I'd have fired her
in a heartbeat.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.533
- You guys are all fighting.
You're ----ing.

00:11.567 --> 00:13.033
- Don't act innocent.

00:13.066 --> 00:17.033
- What happens in Tahiti
gets exposed right here.

00:17.066 --> 00:18.467
- So the two of you
hooked up last night.

00:18.500 --> 00:19.500
- What?

00:19.533 --> 00:21.000
- He was
a condescending prick.

00:21.033 --> 00:22.533
- I totally misread
the situation.

00:22.567 --> 00:23.800
- Are you ----in'
kidding me?

00:23.834 --> 00:25.500
- I thought you should have
addressed that situation.

00:25.533 --> 00:27.133
- I have a surprise
for you guys.

00:27.166 --> 00:29.767
Please welcome the cameraman
who saved Ashton.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.633
- If Rhylee hadn't said
"Man overboard",

00:31.667 --> 00:32.633
it was all over.

00:32.667 --> 00:35.433
- Because the Below Deck
Reunion starts now.

00:39.367 --> 00:40.266
- Hey, everybody.

00:40.300 --> 00:43.433
Welcome to the Below Deck
Season 6 Reunion.

00:43.467 --> 00:45.667
I'm Andy Cohen in
the Bravo Clubhouse

00:45.700 --> 00:47.767
with the crew of
the Tahitian mega yacht,

00:47.800 --> 00:49.800
My Seanna.

00:49.834 --> 00:52.633
Welcome Laura.
- Hi.

00:52.667 --> 00:55.300
- Hi, Ashton.
- Hey, Andy.

00:55.333 --> 00:56.900
- Hey, Ross.
- Hey, bud.

00:56.934 --> 00:58.400
- Captain Lee.
- How are ya, Andy.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.300
- Stud of the sea.
- Thank you.

01:00.333 --> 01:01.200
- You're welcome.

01:01.233 --> 01:02.900
Hi, Kate.
- Hi, Andy.

01:02.934 --> 01:04.100
- Hi, Josiah.
- Hello.

01:04.133 --> 01:05.667
How are you?
- Great.

01:05.700 --> 01:07.200
- Hi, Rhylee.
- Hi, Andy.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.233
- Hi, Tyler.
- Hey, Andy.

01:09.266 --> 01:11.000
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

01:11.033 --> 01:13.066
- Last but not least,
Chef Adrian.

01:13.100 --> 01:14.066
- Hey.

01:14.100 --> 01:15.667
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

01:15.700 --> 01:19.500
- Chandler and Caroline will
not be joining us tonight.

01:19.533 --> 01:21.867
But we have a whole lotta show
and I wanna get started.

01:21.900 --> 01:26.266
First of all, who's kept in
touch since the show has ended?

01:26.300 --> 01:30.767
Is the bromance still on
between, uh, Ashton and Ross?

01:30.800 --> 01:31.700
- Yep, 100%.
- Yes?

01:31.734 --> 01:32.834
- Yep.
- Yeah.

01:32.867 --> 01:34.066
- He's actually--
he's like my--

01:34.100 --> 01:35.834
he's like a girlfriend.
- Really?

01:35.867 --> 01:37.800
- If I don't check in on him
everyday, he gets upset.

01:37.834 --> 01:41.400
- Oh.
- Awe. That's sweet.

01:41.433 --> 01:44.934
Ross, Kate F., uh, from
Brooklyn wants to know about

01:44.967 --> 01:47.400
your recent arrest
in West Palm Beach.

01:47.433 --> 01:48.533
What happened?

01:48.567 --> 01:50.133
- Oh, it was just me
and a couple of mates

01:50.166 --> 01:51.500
having a fun night out.

01:51.533 --> 01:53.500
Um, that's pretty much
all I can say.

01:53.533 --> 01:55.934
I can't really
elaborate on it.

01:55.967 --> 01:59.300
But, um, it was just-- it was
a big misunderstanding, um--

01:59.333 --> 02:01.667
- It always is.
- Yeah.

02:01.700 --> 02:04.567
- Um, Heather B.
from Cold Spring Harbor,

02:04.600 --> 02:06.734
wants to know, was Krystal
your worst charter guest

02:06.767 --> 02:08.467
of the season?

02:08.500 --> 02:10.066
- Of my life.
- Really?

02:10.100 --> 02:11.300
[laughing]
- Yeah.

02:11.333 --> 02:12.200
- Is that true?

02:12.233 --> 02:13.834
- I think so.
She was so mean.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.767
- You know, Ross, our intrepid
staff of Watch What Happens Live

02:16.800 --> 02:20.700
noticed that Krystal
was your date

02:20.734 --> 02:23.266
when you did the show.

02:23.300 --> 02:26.200
- I invited her and a friend
and her friend--

02:26.233 --> 02:28.600
and, um, yeah.
- Is--

02:28.633 --> 02:30.734
are-are the two of you
seeing each other?

02:30.767 --> 02:32.600
- Oh, we just hang out
every now and then.

02:32.633 --> 02:34.266
So, yeah, we keep in touch.

02:34.300 --> 02:35.800
- Friends with benefits.
- Yeah.

02:35.834 --> 02:37.533
Well, I wouldn't
say that but, um--

02:37.567 --> 02:39.066
- Just benefits?
- Just benefits, yeah.

02:39.100 --> 02:42.400
- Just benefits.
Not friends. Okay.

02:42.433 --> 02:44.934
Wow! I mean,
isn't she married?

02:44.967 --> 02:47.667
[laughing]
- That's what I thought.

02:47.700 --> 02:48.800
- Sh--, bro, you're
having a hard time.

02:48.834 --> 02:50.700
[laughing]

02:50.734 --> 02:52.033
- No, she's--
no, she's not married.

02:52.066 --> 02:54.900
- Not anymore.
- So far as I know, I think.

02:54.934 --> 02:57.834
- Well, Chief Stewardess Kate
returned for another season

02:57.867 --> 02:59.166
on Below Deck?

02:59.200 --> 03:01.500
With the second stew
of her dreams

03:01.533 --> 03:03.467
and a third stew situation

03:03.500 --> 03:06.000
that was more like
a recurring nightmare.

03:06.033 --> 03:07.700
Take a look.

03:07.734 --> 03:09.500
- I'm just gonna go up
and see the guests.

03:09.533 --> 03:11.567
- Josiah is so great.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.133
- Yeah, he's really
on top of it.

03:13.166 --> 03:15.834
- Honestly, he's my favorite
stew I've ever had

03:15.867 --> 03:17.266
in all my seasons.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.433
- Oh, my God.

03:23.066 --> 03:25.233
- I gave my two days
yesterday.

03:25.266 --> 03:27.166
This morning, Kate and Josiah
came to the door

03:27.200 --> 03:28.900
and they started
banging on my door.

03:28.934 --> 03:31.800
He yelled, "Who gave
this crazy girl a lock?"

03:31.834 --> 03:33.567
I just think it's best
that I leave.

03:33.600 --> 03:36.233
- How do things
go that south that quick?

03:36.266 --> 03:37.767
- I don't think there's
a lot of truth to many--

03:37.800 --> 03:39.100
anything she says.

03:39.133 --> 03:40.900
- It's disappointing
because I don't know

03:40.934 --> 03:42.500
if I'll ever get
all of the details.

03:42.533 --> 03:43.567
- What's the
chief stew's name?

03:43.600 --> 03:44.500
- Kate.
- Hi.

03:44.533 --> 03:45.600
- Hey.
Hi, nice to meet you.

03:45.633 --> 03:47.900
Yeah, I used to be a chief
on the same sized vessel.

03:47.934 --> 03:50.633
- I think you might be a little
confused about what turndown is.

03:50.667 --> 03:51.900
- Here we go.

03:51.934 --> 03:53.700
- I thought since you
had so much experience

03:53.734 --> 03:55.333
that I didn't have
to explain it.

03:55.367 --> 03:57.767
Come on.
This one...

03:57.800 --> 03:58.700
is like that.

03:58.734 --> 03:59.800
And that one's like that.
- Kate.

03:59.834 --> 04:02.033
I don't understand why
you're being so aggressive.

04:02.066 --> 04:05.333
You need to seriously
figure your sh-- out.

04:05.367 --> 04:08.066
There is hundreds of other ways
that you could have approached

04:08.100 --> 04:09.266
that situation.
- Shh.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.400
- Like, you need
to check yourself.

04:11.433 --> 04:12.700
Understood?

04:12.734 --> 04:14.367
- Um, we have an issue.
- Okay.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.834
- The issue is Laura.

04:15.867 --> 04:18.367
- She just got rid of
one problem with Caroline

04:18.400 --> 04:20.367
and here's another one.

04:20.400 --> 04:23.300
I can't just be pullin' stews
off of fig trees out here.

04:24.533 --> 04:27.266
- Um, lots to discuss.

04:27.300 --> 04:30.667
Uh, Tilla A. from
Canberra, Australia,

04:30.700 --> 04:33.533
wants to know, uh, for
Adrian, Riley, Ross and Ashton,

04:33.567 --> 04:35.200
what were your thoughts
on the whole

04:35.233 --> 04:37.333
Caroline and Kate situation?

04:37.367 --> 04:38.500
- She was my roommate,

04:38.533 --> 04:39.934
so I got to hear
a lot about it.

04:39.967 --> 04:44.066
You know, she was very
distraught all day, everyday.

04:44.100 --> 04:45.767
- I had quite a few
conversations with her

04:45.800 --> 04:48.567
on the bow when she was going
through all of the stuff

04:48.600 --> 04:52.834
and she just, you know,
she just wasn't coping.

04:52.867 --> 04:56.700
- I spoke to Caroline,
uh, earlier tonight.

04:56.734 --> 05:00.700
Uh, and... she reflected
something

05:00.734 --> 05:02.633
that's-that's reflected
in this question here

05:02.667 --> 05:06.066
where she said that there's
been a pattern of stews

05:06.100 --> 05:09.100
that have not
gotten along with Kate.

05:09.133 --> 05:11.567
And, uh, Debbie M.
from Indiana said,

05:11.600 --> 05:13.533
"there have been
several stews that have said

05:13.567 --> 05:14.967
"Kate is awful
to work with."

05:15.000 --> 05:17.033
Captain Lee, do you think
their complaints

05:17.066 --> 05:20.633
have any merits after
watching this season?

05:20.667 --> 05:23.300
- I think the only stews
that have had complaints

05:23.333 --> 05:27.767
about Kate's, uh,
method of operation

05:27.800 --> 05:31.066
are the ones that don't
wanna do their job.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.533
And if you don't
pull your weight,

05:33.567 --> 05:35.700
I don't have
any sympathy for you.

05:35.734 --> 05:38.800
- Laura, what was
your reaction to watching,

05:38.834 --> 05:41.934
uh, Caroline's experience
on the boat.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.867
- Yeah. You know what,
I felt really bad for her.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.266
Obviously, I wasn't there.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.934
So I don't know exactly
how things went down.

05:47.967 --> 05:51.100
However, I don't
think it was entirely fair

05:51.133 --> 05:52.367
how she was treated.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.700
- What's your reaction
to that?

05:53.734 --> 05:55.367
- Actually, I feel like
we were very nice to her.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.667
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I don't know.

05:56.700 --> 05:58.333
- Until she--
- I've never been so
patient with someone...

05:58.367 --> 05:59.266
- I know.
- ...in my life.

05:59.300 --> 06:01.233
Normally, it's like,
we teach you once

06:01.266 --> 06:02.166
and if you don't get it,

06:02.200 --> 06:03.400
write it down
and you can do it.

06:03.433 --> 06:09.000
- Um, Caroline tweeted, uh, that
what we saw on the last day,

06:09.033 --> 06:12.400
when Kate and Josiah blasted
music outside her door

06:12.433 --> 06:17.133
was not remotely close, uh,
to what actually happened.

06:17.166 --> 06:20.100
Uh, agree or--?

06:20.133 --> 06:23.767
- I think that Caroline has
a flair for the dramatic.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.200
I think that when things
don't go her way,

06:26.233 --> 06:28.233
she's very--
she's very intelligent.

06:28.266 --> 06:31.100
Uh, I think she's very good
at playing the victim role.

06:31.133 --> 06:35.133
- It was a specific moment that
she was, um, tweeting about.

06:35.166 --> 06:38.533
- Uh, that we have.
Let's take a look.

06:38.567 --> 06:40.934
- You're leaving because
your herpes are flaring up?

06:40.967 --> 06:42.400
I don't blame you.

06:42.433 --> 06:44.667
[groaning]
- Oh, that's not good.

06:44.700 --> 06:47.066
- That's so gross.
- Oh, my God...

06:47.100 --> 06:48.734
I'd hate my herpes
to be flaring up.

06:48.767 --> 06:50.567
- I mean, I don't have
herpes, but you do.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.467
- Yeah, well, if I did.
- I'm glad you're leaving.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.133
- Don't want to
spread that sh--.

06:55.166 --> 06:56.533
- Nuh-uh.
- That's not good.

06:56.567 --> 07:00.300
- Of all your
infectious diseases.

07:00.333 --> 07:03.200
- So that's kinda mean,
you know.

07:03.233 --> 07:05.367
- You know what, I-I agree.
It is mean.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.867
But what she did--
I didn't instigate this.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.200
What she did was mean.

07:09.233 --> 07:10.667
She lied in front
of the whole crew

07:10.700 --> 07:12.166
after we'd been
pulling her weight

07:12.200 --> 07:14.100
and I was tired--
I think she's the bully.

07:14.133 --> 07:16.033
I don't think it was great,

07:16.066 --> 07:19.166
but I don't think
that I started it.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.800
- How do you feel
watching that?

07:20.834 --> 07:23.567
- Um, watching it, makes me
feel uncomfortable.

07:23.600 --> 07:28.867
But, um... when you realize
that it was an ongoing thing

07:28.900 --> 07:32.967
and Caroline flat out
did not pull her weight.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.233
- Do you regret anything
you-you said to her.

07:36.266 --> 07:38.433
Of course I regret that.
- Yeah.

07:38.467 --> 07:39.600
- But--
- But if it's in the moment

07:39.633 --> 07:41.767
and it was-- we were angry
because we had to pick her--

07:41.800 --> 07:43.467
like pull her weight
the whole...

07:43.500 --> 07:45.000
- I felt like we were
a hostage to her

07:45.033 --> 07:46.767
and she was just doing
whatever she wanted.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.867
- We probably shouldn't
have done that

07:47.900 --> 07:49.433
but she also
should have been working.

07:49.467 --> 07:50.600
- And nobody was--
- You know what, Andy,

07:50.633 --> 07:51.600
you've got to look at
the build-up.

07:51.633 --> 07:52.633
You've got to look at
what pushed them

07:52.667 --> 07:54.166
to get that nasty
with somebody.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.233
You know the way that she
ended things with them.

07:56.266 --> 07:58.433
The fact that she gives
her two days notice,

07:58.467 --> 07:59.633
doesn't do anything.

07:59.667 --> 08:01.100
I would-I would be
bitter too, you know.

08:01.133 --> 08:03.633
- You kept saying, "We don't
wanna be mean girls.

08:03.667 --> 08:05.433
"We don't wanna--"
You know, you kept saying it.

08:05.467 --> 08:06.900
- Mm-hmm.
- And then,

08:06.934 --> 08:10.900
you hit a point where you
totally became mean girls.

08:10.934 --> 08:13.934
I mean...
- That point, yeah.

08:13.967 --> 08:16.200
But she was pretty mean
before that, uh,

08:16.233 --> 08:18.166
when she told everybody
that she didn't wanna

08:18.200 --> 08:19.700
eat sh-- with
a knife and fork and that--

08:19.734 --> 08:20.800
it was just all lies.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.033
- She wanted to plant
a seed in everyone's minds.

08:22.066 --> 08:23.133
- Yeah.

08:23.166 --> 08:24.800
- About how horrible we
were just before she left.

08:24.834 --> 08:27.033
- Josiah, Carrie B.
from Boston said,

08:27.066 --> 08:28.400
"Later in the season,
you talked about

08:28.433 --> 08:30.033
"how you were bullied
when you were younger

08:30.066 --> 08:31.533
"and how much that hurt you.

08:31.567 --> 08:34.133
"But isn't that what
you did to Caroline?"

08:34.166 --> 08:36.000
- I mean, I was bullied
a lot when I was younger,

08:36.033 --> 08:38.567
but I think it made me
a stronger person.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.200
And, I regret kind of--

08:40.233 --> 08:41.767
I don't think it was the best
thing to do to play music

08:41.800 --> 08:43.967
outside the room, but we had
got to a breaking point.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.734
I didn't just-- it wasn't
like it was all happy families

08:46.767 --> 08:48.700
and then that one last day
we were bullying her.

08:48.734 --> 08:49.800
- I liked her.

08:49.834 --> 08:51.066
- Yeah, she wasn't
a bad person.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.233
She wasn't a horrible--
we liked her.

08:52.266 --> 08:53.967
She-- we got along
very well,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.100
but we were trying
to, you know...

08:56.133 --> 08:58.066
- Do a job.
- Yeah, do a job.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.734
And it was...
She just didn't want to.

09:00.767 --> 09:04.000
- After watching how
the Caroline situation
played out,

09:04.033 --> 09:06.533
Lee, do you feel validated
in questioning

09:06.567 --> 09:08.734
Kate's side of the story?

09:08.767 --> 09:12.400
- I think that's a situation
I could have handled better.

09:12.433 --> 09:14.967
I didn't have all of
the information that I needed

09:15.000 --> 09:16.500
to have going into it.

09:16.533 --> 09:18.300
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

09:18.333 --> 09:22.433
And so, no, I don't
think I handled that

09:22.467 --> 09:24.200
as well as I could have.

09:24.233 --> 09:25.700
- I like that
you question me now

09:25.734 --> 09:27.900
'cause it shows that
he's fair.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.500
But at the time,
I did not like it.

09:29.533 --> 09:32.166
Uh, because I feel like I have
worked for him long enough.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.900
I wish that ideally
what would have happened,

09:34.934 --> 09:37.300
Caroline, Captain Lee
and myself would have

09:37.333 --> 09:39.500
all been in
the wheelhouse together

09:39.533 --> 09:41.800
because there would
have been no confusion.

09:41.834 --> 09:43.000
- Coming up...

09:43.033 --> 09:46.500
I obviously had the reason
to be pushed, right.

09:46.533 --> 09:48.200
- What was that?
- So--

09:48.233 --> 09:50.233
well, you
weren't really nice.

09:58.500 --> 09:58.834
- Laura, Nicki E.

09:58.834 --> 09:59.233
- Laura, Nicki E.
from Joplin, Missouri

10:00.734 --> 10:02.967
wants to know why
you came in so hot

10:03.000 --> 10:05.300
with such
a superior attitude.

10:05.333 --> 10:07.233
"Did you really expect to
get along with the crew

10:07.266 --> 10:08.567
"with that attitude?"

10:08.600 --> 10:11.967
- You know what, I did
not have that intention.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.467
- The best.
- At all.

10:13.500 --> 10:16.066
- But you recognize now
in watching your attitude

10:16.100 --> 10:17.600
that it wasn't great?

10:17.633 --> 10:19.700
- Yeah, 100%, but I didn't
have that intention,

10:19.734 --> 10:21.600
which is what's
so sad about it.

10:21.633 --> 10:23.000
Like, I didn't mean
to do that.

10:23.033 --> 10:25.266
And yes, of course I see
how it came across.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.700
- It was-- it-it was
really something

10:26.734 --> 10:30.133
when you handed
Kate's ass to her. Uh...

10:30.166 --> 10:31.900
- We all have
our breaking points.

10:31.934 --> 10:32.900
- Right.
- Yeah.

10:32.934 --> 10:34.600
- What was your reaction
when you saw that?

10:34.633 --> 10:36.567
- I'd have fired her
on the spot.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.667
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.400
- Yeah. Um...
- In a heartbeat.

10:40.433 --> 10:41.467
- Okay.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.500
- What was your reaction
when she was...

10:43.533 --> 10:44.734
- Bewildered.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:44.767 --> 10:46.700
- I was just like--
- That's a good term,
bewildered.

10:46.734 --> 10:48.834
- Because you had said
you were a chief stew

10:48.867 --> 10:52.734
of a vessel that size,
so it was ironic to me

10:52.767 --> 10:55.900
for someone who's--
is saying they know it all,

10:55.934 --> 10:57.600
you were doing
the one thing--

10:57.633 --> 10:59.033
like something you really
shouldn't be doing,

10:59.066 --> 11:00.500
which is scream at me
in front of charter guests.

11:00.533 --> 11:03.266
So it was just like, it's
almost amusing, almost.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.233
- You know what I
thought was amazing?

11:05.266 --> 11:08.266
- What?
- In that whole exchange was,

11:08.300 --> 11:11.533
"how dare you go back
and check my work?"

11:11.567 --> 11:14.934
- No, I know. I also agree
that that was weird.

11:14.967 --> 11:17.000
- Like, oh, my God.
- And I didn't mean to say that.

11:17.033 --> 11:19.367
- Who doesn't-who doesn't
check somebody else's work?

11:19.400 --> 11:23.567
- Somebody's-- I was
angry and in hysterics.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.233
I was pushed, I was in
a corner that whole time.

11:26.266 --> 11:28.300
- You cornered me.
[laughter]

11:28.333 --> 11:29.800
- I mean, leading up
to it, though.

11:29.834 --> 11:31.400
- I was just servin' dinner,
doin' my thing.

11:31.433 --> 11:32.934
I was like--
- Okay, don't act innocent,

11:32.967 --> 11:35.000
because, you know,
leading up to it,

11:35.033 --> 11:38.867
I was obviously-- had the reason
to be pushed, right?

11:38.900 --> 11:40.467
So--
- What was that?

11:40.500 --> 11:43.266
- Well, ya weren't really
nice from the beginning.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.166
- Well, why do you
think that was?

11:45.200 --> 11:46.467
- We talked about it
just now.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.400
Because I came off--
- Okay, so we're back there.

11:48.433 --> 11:51.767
- Laura, what advice
would you give Kate, uh,

11:51.800 --> 11:54.667
on how to be
a better boss to you,

11:54.700 --> 11:57.333
and in turn
to future stews?

11:57.367 --> 12:02.233
- You know what,
I would say that...

12:02.266 --> 12:04.000
you know, kindness
goes a long way.

12:04.033 --> 12:06.900
And I think that you've been
doing this for so long

12:06.934 --> 12:08.467
that you just don't
like putting up with

12:08.500 --> 12:10.700
stupid mistakes
and stupid things,

12:10.734 --> 12:12.567
which is fair.
I get that.

12:12.600 --> 12:16.333
But maybe recognizing, like,
someone else's point of view

12:16.367 --> 12:18.033
or perspective
or where they are.

12:18.066 --> 12:20.166
- I would like to be able
to manage that way.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.066
But you-you saw
the boat.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.266
There's not enough time
to do the things

12:23.300 --> 12:24.266
we're supposed to do.
- Yeah.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.800
- Plus extra, which is
like training camp.

12:26.834 --> 12:28.100
- No, I know.
I-I agree.

12:28.133 --> 12:30.066
- I'm being as kind as I can
with the time I'm given.

12:30.100 --> 12:32.400
- Um, would the two of
you work together again?

12:32.433 --> 12:33.500
- Yeah.
- Yeah, for sure.

12:33.533 --> 12:35.400
- You would?
- Yeah.

12:35.433 --> 12:37.734
- Chef Adrian's first class
culinary skills

12:37.767 --> 12:40.000
had charter guests
salivating.

12:40.033 --> 12:42.834
But somewhere along the way,
his behavior started to leave

12:42.867 --> 12:47.000
a bad taste in his fellow
crew members' mouths.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.500
- Cooking for
ten people definitely

12:48.533 --> 12:49.967
stifles my creativity.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.600
Everything has to be
calculated,

12:51.633 --> 12:53.467
and that tends to
stress me out and piss me off.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.700
We all have a lot of
intense sh-- going on,

12:55.734 --> 12:56.967
so just try
and pull yourself together.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.133
- But-- yeah,
but I'm not you.

12:58.166 --> 13:00.233
- When you're in that attitude,
then you put it on me.

13:00.266 --> 13:02.266
If you can't handle your sh--
then you need to step off.

13:02.300 --> 13:05.333
Every time we've done
any sort of beach excursion
or anything,

13:05.367 --> 13:07.433
everything was set up
every time I got here.

13:07.467 --> 13:08.533
- Yes, this is--
- So, I mean,

13:08.567 --> 13:10.166
it's just different.
You just have to let me know.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.700
There's no point in
even arguing about it.

13:13.934 --> 13:15.066
- Oh, I-I know.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.000
- He makes, like,
the comments all day.

13:17.033 --> 13:17.934
- What do you mean?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.100
- Do you think that looks
like a nipple?

13:19.133 --> 13:21.834
- Like a... nipple.
Yeah, kinda.

13:21.867 --> 13:24.200
- I was inspired by
the form of your breast.

13:27.033 --> 13:28.667
- What's that?
- No, right here.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.300
- Oh, my...

13:30.333 --> 13:32.867
The jokes you made were
super, like, inappropriate,

13:32.900 --> 13:34.667
and they didn't make me
feel good at all.

13:34.700 --> 13:37.166
Like, girls always
get this sh--.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.066
- If you would've said any time
that it was inappropriate,

13:40.100 --> 13:41.200
I would've stopped
instantly.

13:41.233 --> 13:44.066
- Some of the stuff you said
has been so over the edge

13:44.100 --> 13:46.967
and, like, has been, like,
you know, singling me out

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
in front of people.

13:48.033 --> 13:49.533
- I learned to be more
patient with myself.

13:49.567 --> 13:50.767
I sometimes make mistakes,

13:50.800 --> 13:54.133
and I just have to
own up to it. Namaste.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.667
- So, um, Marina T. from
Redwood City, Virginia

13:57.700 --> 13:59.934
wants to know,
"did anyone know that

13:59.967 --> 14:03.900
"Adrian was an undercover jerk?
Why didn't anyone say anything?"

14:03.934 --> 14:06.433
[laughing]
- Adrian's a lovely person.

14:06.467 --> 14:09.033
Um, he's from Saint Martin.
I don't know.

14:09.066 --> 14:10.300
You guys have been
to Saint Martin.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.300
It's a fun place.
It's--

14:12.333 --> 14:14.967
I love it, but it's
very-- it's different,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.066
especially from Canada,
which is more conservative.

14:17.100 --> 14:18.300
- Laura's a very
strong person,

14:18.333 --> 14:20.367
and it wasn't the fact
that it was getting to her.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.000
I think she was
just saying that,

14:22.033 --> 14:23.633
"I'm quite a strong person,
and I can deal with it,

14:23.667 --> 14:25.400
"but other people
might not be able to."

14:25.433 --> 14:28.633
So maybe just be wary of what--
of how you say things.

14:28.667 --> 14:29.767
- And I appreciate that.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.500
That was-that was a very
genuine comment, and...

14:32.533 --> 14:34.667
yeah, I feel apologetic
about that whole situation,

14:34.700 --> 14:36.867
'cause I totally
misread the situation.

14:36.900 --> 14:39.533
And one thing that's-that's
disappointing is that

14:39.567 --> 14:41.133
they didn't show more
of our relationship,

14:41.166 --> 14:43.667
'cause we-- I mean,
we had 150 conversations

14:43.700 --> 14:45.266
every day about everything.
- Yeah.

14:45.300 --> 14:46.800
- And we joked about
everything.

14:46.834 --> 14:48.500
So that's just
a little tiny part of it.

14:48.533 --> 14:49.967
- It was a really tiny
part of it.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.166
It was easy to brush off.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.333
- You left it 'til like
the last minute,

14:52.367 --> 14:53.600
though, didn't you?
- Yeah.

14:53.633 --> 14:55.900
- And you could've addressed it,
like, pretty much straight away.

14:55.934 --> 14:57.900
But you left it as we were
walking off the boat,

14:57.934 --> 15:00.000
which I felt
pretty-pretty odd.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.400
I think-- I thought you
should've addressed

15:01.433 --> 15:04.633
that situation straight away
when you felt that you were--

15:04.667 --> 15:05.967
- Shoulda, woulda,
coulda, right?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.967
- Is the chef-- but on the hand,
is the chef your superior?

15:09.000 --> 15:10.367
- Yeah, 100%.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.867
- There are a few moments
where you watch it--

15:11.900 --> 15:13.633
I mean, it is a workplace,

15:13.667 --> 15:15.667
and it is a very
unique workplace,

15:15.700 --> 15:18.200
and it's different
from e-every other--

15:18.233 --> 15:20.200
I mean, you guys are all
fighting, you're ----ing.

15:20.233 --> 15:21.734
I mean, I don't know
what's going on.

15:21.767 --> 15:23.800
- We eat, sleep,
and work together.

15:23.834 --> 15:24.867
- Like, you know--
no, but you are, but--

15:24.900 --> 15:27.300
so I mean, I get that
it's totally different.

15:27.333 --> 15:29.400
And by the way,
I wanna work on a boat.

15:29.433 --> 15:30.400
[laughter]

15:30.433 --> 15:32.967
Um, you know, you, uh--

15:33.000 --> 15:36.567
you know, but-but as you're
looking at it in 2019,

15:36.600 --> 15:39.467
you could see a-- from where
I was watching the show,

15:39.500 --> 15:42.000
I mean, it-it looked
a little awkward as he's saying,

15:42.033 --> 15:44.000
like, "here's my meat."
I mean, it's--

15:44.033 --> 15:45.367
- Definitely,
oh, for sure.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.433
- It reads differently.
- Oh, completely.

15:46.467 --> 15:48.200
And I-I just thought I was
being funny at the time.

15:48.233 --> 15:50.233
And looking back on it, I mean,
I had no recollection

15:50.266 --> 15:51.500
of that whatsoever.
- Right, yeah.

15:51.533 --> 15:54.100
- It made me cringe, for sure.
It wasn't funny at all.

15:54.133 --> 15:55.867
- Here's a good question
for Lee and Kate.

15:55.900 --> 15:57.633
Emily P. from Washington
wants to know,

15:57.667 --> 16:01.100
"why did Laura have to
deal with Adrian by herself?

16:01.133 --> 16:03.900
Isn't this something
her supervisor should do,

16:03.934 --> 16:07.133
like Kate or even
Captain Lee?"

16:07.166 --> 16:08.767
- Um, I don't think
I was aware of it,

16:08.800 --> 16:09.767
made aware of it.
- Right.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.000
So if she had come to you
and said it, then--

16:12.033 --> 16:13.500
- Oh, yeah, I would--
I would've pulled Adrian aside

16:13.533 --> 16:15.133
and been like, "Hey, listen,
she's a little freaked out."

16:15.166 --> 16:17.400
- Right.
- "Knock it off."

16:17.433 --> 16:22.300
[indistinct chatter]
- Yeah, "stop doin' it," yeah.

16:22.333 --> 16:23.467
- Coming up...

16:23.500 --> 16:26.600
Ross, do you think that
Chandler deserved to be fired?

16:26.633 --> 16:28.100
- Well...

16:36.100 --> 16:36.567
- While the interior crew

16:36.567 --> 16:36.967
- While the interior crew
had their own struggles,

16:38.433 --> 16:42.533
the exterior crew,
lacking clear direction
from Chandler,

16:42.567 --> 16:45.433
found themselves
completely lost.

16:45.467 --> 16:46.900
Roll it.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.066
- Okay, um...

16:53.400 --> 16:55.133
- Hey, Captain, we need
a thrust, uh, to port.

16:55.166 --> 16:57.166
- You want me to thrust to
portside and it's over here.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.333
- Starboard.
That's my bad.

16:59.367 --> 17:00.700
- Are we off the bottom
or not?

17:00.734 --> 17:03.000
Ross gives me better
directions than Chandler does.

17:03.033 --> 17:05.200
- Chandler was to
receive information.

17:05.233 --> 17:08.133
When it gets back to me,
I'm bein' misinformed.

17:08.166 --> 17:09.700
There's no direction
on the boat.

17:09.734 --> 17:11.667
That's making us all
look bad.

17:11.700 --> 17:15.000
- Hey, if we haven't already,
can we, uh, top off the jacuzzi?

17:15.033 --> 17:16.934
- How the (BLEEP)
does that happen?

17:16.967 --> 17:18.433
[sighs]
Chandler.

17:18.467 --> 17:19.400
Chandler, Lee?

17:19.433 --> 17:20.333
- There needs to be
a change.

17:20.367 --> 17:22.033
I feel like Ross
should be bosun.

17:22.066 --> 17:26.133
Every ----in' mistake that was
made today is on Chandler.

17:26.166 --> 17:27.767
- I expected more
outta Chandler.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.767
But if it were just
one little thing,

17:29.800 --> 17:31.934
it probably
wouldn't be so bad.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.166
There's just so many.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.033
We just don't have
a chemistry.

17:36.066 --> 17:37.467
I don't think it's
a good fit.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.367
- I've done pretty much
everything I can do

17:39.400 --> 17:40.967
for the team,
and it's just not--

17:41.000 --> 17:42.066
it's not workin'.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.900
- Ross is gonna step into
the bosun's position.

17:44.934 --> 17:47.300
You'll be taking
your direction from him.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.533
- Well done, brother.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.166
- Ashton, you'll be
helpin' me this morning.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.633
All Chandler needed
to do was communicate.

17:52.667 --> 17:54.100
I don't wanna make
those same mistakes.

17:54.133 --> 17:55.100
Yeah, we'll be all right.

17:55.133 --> 17:56.800
- That was good.
Nice job, bosun.

17:56.834 --> 17:58.834
- Shut up.

17:58.867 --> 18:01.467
- What was the problem
with him, do you think?

18:01.500 --> 18:02.834
I mean, just--
- Overwhelmed.

18:02.867 --> 18:03.934
- Overwhelmed.
- I think so.

18:03.967 --> 18:06.667
- Cracking under pressure.
- A 185-foot, uh--

18:06.700 --> 18:10.734
a lotta toys, a lotta people,
a lotta things going on,

18:10.767 --> 18:12.367
and then he had cameras.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.734
And I don't know why--

18:16.767 --> 18:18.967
because it just certainly
seemed on paper

18:19.000 --> 18:20.667
and it certainly seemed
by chatting with him

18:20.700 --> 18:23.266
that he had
the necessary tools.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.767
- Do you--
- But he didn't apply.

18:24.800 --> 18:25.800
- Do you agree with
that assessment?

18:25.834 --> 18:27.066
- I definitely--
yeah, I definitely agree.

18:27.100 --> 18:30.834
Um, I think just--
yeah, outside of the-the show,

18:30.867 --> 18:32.600
he's-- he had the skills.

18:32.633 --> 18:35.367
I mean, he was a good worker,
but he just couldn't, um--

18:35.400 --> 18:37.500
there was just
no direction with him, and--

18:37.533 --> 18:38.867
- Do you think the fact
that everything

18:38.900 --> 18:40.400
was being filmed
played into it?

18:40.433 --> 18:41.467
- Yeah, definitely.

18:41.500 --> 18:42.700
I think that's got
a big part of it.

18:42.734 --> 18:44.834
And I just--
I think that he--

18:44.867 --> 18:45.934
I'm not too sure
if he's managed

18:45.967 --> 18:49.867
a-a lot of deck crew
in his previous jobs.

18:49.900 --> 18:51.233
Like I said,
he had the skillset.

18:51.266 --> 18:54.033
He just didn't have any
managing skills, you know?

18:54.066 --> 18:57.433
- Ashton and Rhylee,
how surprised were you

18:57.467 --> 18:59.133
when Chandler got fired?

18:59.166 --> 19:02.567
And maybe a better question
is how relieved were you?

19:02.600 --> 19:04.166
- I certainly was relieved.
- Yeah.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.533
- I-I was treated
very poorly by Chandler,

19:06.567 --> 19:09.066
and not just because of
his lack of management skills.

19:09.100 --> 19:12.100
He treated me very poorly.

19:12.133 --> 19:14.600
I didn't sit there and jump
up and down for joy

19:14.633 --> 19:16.266
that he was gone,
but I did--

19:16.300 --> 19:18.800
I certainly didn't think that
you would fire him, either.

19:18.834 --> 19:22.300
I thought maybe he'd be,
you know, taken back a role.

19:22.333 --> 19:24.166
- I think at-at that point,
something had to change.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.233
- Yeah.
- Um, somebody was leaving,

19:26.266 --> 19:28.767
and it was between
Rhylee and Chandler,

19:28.800 --> 19:31.033
because that's where
most of the conflict was.

19:31.066 --> 19:32.967
I don't think it was
surprising to anybody.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.133
I think it needed
to happen.

19:34.166 --> 19:36.033
Something had to happen
at that-at that point.

19:36.066 --> 19:39.834
- Ross, do you think that
Chandler deserved to be fired?

19:41.934 --> 19:43.967
- Yeah, yes, in a way.
Like, he just--

19:44.000 --> 19:45.066
we just weren't,
um, performing as a team.

19:46.567 --> 19:49.166
We were making
just too many mistakes,

19:49.200 --> 19:50.834
and there needed to be a change.

19:50.867 --> 19:53.066
- Has anyone spoken to Chandler
since he left?

19:53.100 --> 19:54.500
You have, Adrian?
- Yeah.

19:54.533 --> 19:56.834
- Um, at the beginning
of the show,

19:56.867 --> 19:59.300
he was a little bit distraught,
but then he--

19:59.333 --> 20:01.967
I think he just brushed it off
and decided to go his own way

20:02.000 --> 20:04.333
and not pay too much mind
about it.

20:04.367 --> 20:06.400
- Like, he's a really--
he's a really good guy.

20:06.433 --> 20:08.433
- Yeah.
- He is, yeah, very much so.

20:08.467 --> 20:12.700
- He just had trouble, uh,
working on this boat,

20:12.734 --> 20:14.233
and working-working
with the crew.

20:14.266 --> 20:15.400
- I just don't think
he's used to charters.

20:15.433 --> 20:16.800
I think he's used to
a very well oiled--
- Private.

20:16.834 --> 20:19.533
- Private boat that
he was a deckhand on once,

20:19.567 --> 20:20.567
and he's moved up to bosun,

20:20.600 --> 20:22.066
which basically
means you just get paid more,

20:22.100 --> 20:24.000
and everyone knows
what they're doing.

20:24.033 --> 20:25.367
So going from that
to working on a boat

20:25.400 --> 20:27.433
where he actually has to
organize everything...
- Right.

20:27.467 --> 20:30.066
- Was like a shock to him.
Because he's not used to it.

20:30.100 --> 20:32.734
- Um, Rhylee,
Candice from Memphis said

20:32.767 --> 20:34.867
you clearly hated Chandler.

20:34.900 --> 20:39.500
What was it about him
that bugged you so much?

20:39.533 --> 20:41.333
- I don't think
I hated Chandler.

20:41.367 --> 20:45.300
I hated how he treated me,
and that's what bugged me

20:45.333 --> 20:49.867
is that he, from the get go,
literally from the get go,

20:49.900 --> 20:53.433
and this really did
set my tone of behavior,

20:53.467 --> 20:54.533
which is my fault, too,

20:54.567 --> 20:59.900
but I was being dismissed
by the deck crew,

20:59.934 --> 21:05.867
and Chandler, most of all,
did not want to manage me,

21:05.900 --> 21:07.767
have me there, whatever.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.734
Brush me off
on Ross and Ashton, and, um--

21:10.767 --> 21:12.967
- Do you think that was
because you were a woman?

21:13.000 --> 21:16.800
- I don't-- I-I have never
cried "woman" before.

21:16.834 --> 21:18.166
It's not-- It's not--

21:18.200 --> 21:19.567
I don't know,
I can't speak on that,

21:19.600 --> 21:21.633
because I don't have
a very strong opinion

21:21.667 --> 21:24.166
as a-a feminist,
I guess, would.

21:24.200 --> 21:28.467
But he was very quick
to blame me for everything,

21:28.500 --> 21:33.233
which didn't make any sense.
I'm not a soft spoken person.

21:33.266 --> 21:35.033
I think we all know that.
- Really?

21:35.066 --> 21:40.834
- But, I, you know,
it's to my detriment sometimes,

21:40.867 --> 21:42.333
but I also--

21:42.367 --> 21:46.200
I-I'm not going to let
somebody walk all over me.

21:46.233 --> 21:47.867
And no, did I handle it well?

21:47.900 --> 21:49.500
Absolutely not,
not all the time.

21:49.533 --> 21:55.567
But with Chandler, um,
he-he couldn't be bothered

21:55.600 --> 21:58.467
with anything with me,
and that-- I don't--

21:58.500 --> 21:59.333
I don't give a--

how I feel about that.

22:02.767 --> 22:04.800
- Josiah, you think that
he didn't like her

22:04.834 --> 22:05.900
because she was a woman.

22:05.934 --> 22:08.000
- No, I think it was more
because she's a strong--

22:08.033 --> 22:08.867
she's a strong w--

22:08.900 --> 22:10.033
She's got a very strong
personality,

22:10.066 --> 22:12.600
and I think it's very rare
to have a female deckhand

22:12.633 --> 22:14.567
in the industry,
as it is to have a male steward,

22:14.600 --> 22:16.400
and people do make
preconceptions,

22:16.433 --> 22:18.300
and I think he's just not
used to having a strong woman

do you regret not firing Rhylee
based on her behavior

24:40.800 --> 24:42.367
and blatant disrespect
for the crew

24:42.400 --> 24:45.500
or superiors and guests?

24:45.533 --> 24:47.500
- No, I don't regret
keeping Rhylee on.

24:47.533 --> 24:48.734
- You don't?

24:48.767 --> 24:51.200
- No, I'm-I'm glad she made it
'til the end of the season.

24:51.233 --> 24:55.266
- What did you think of the way
that she treated her superiors?

24:55.300 --> 24:59.533
- Oh, it sucked.
Yeah, it just totally sucked.

24:59.567 --> 25:01.934
- It-- what-what could they

25:01.967 --> 25:04.166
or should they have done
differently?

25:04.200 --> 25:07.266
- Well, Chandler could have done
a lot of things differently

25:07.300 --> 25:09.066
in his method, you know, that--

25:09.100 --> 25:12.066
the method that he used
in handling the situation.

25:12.100 --> 25:16.066
He was, uh, basically
a condescending prick

25:16.100 --> 25:17.500
for the most part.

25:17.533 --> 25:19.700
- What-what could Ross
have done differently?

25:19.734 --> 25:22.533
- I think Ross could have been
a little more--

25:22.567 --> 25:27.033
a little more firm with Rhylee,
up front,

25:27.066 --> 25:32.333
and not-not given in to,
you know, the demands.

25:32.367 --> 25:34.567
Uh, engaging someone

25:34.600 --> 25:37.333
when they're in
a very reactionary state of mind

25:37.367 --> 25:41.000
and volatile is
not the wisest course of action.

25:41.033 --> 25:45.100
- You know, my issues with Ross
were vastly different

25:45.133 --> 25:46.433
than my issues with Chandler,

25:46.467 --> 25:48.633
and again,
a lot of stuff isn't shown,

25:48.667 --> 25:53.233
but, you know,
Ross was an amazing bosun.

25:53.266 --> 25:55.266
Ross is an amazing person.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.834
I one--
it's such a weird dynamic,

25:57.867 --> 26:01.367
his and I's relationship
because we did--

26:01.400 --> 26:04.133
I did have a lot of issues
with him,

26:04.166 --> 26:06.734
and then we were able to
come together every single time

26:06.767 --> 26:08.834
and fix it,
but then we still had issues.

26:08.867 --> 26:10.967
And those were something
I feel like, with Ross,

26:11.000 --> 26:14.333
was a miscommunication
on a lot of things.

26:14.367 --> 26:16.333
But I was certainly
very reactionary,

26:16.367 --> 26:19.100
and I was very apologetic
about it,

26:19.133 --> 26:21.800
and I still am.
- Yeah, definitely.

26:21.834 --> 26:22.934
I try to work with--

26:22.967 --> 26:24.834
I mean, it was hard because
it was kind of no winning

26:24.867 --> 26:26.400
with-with
Rhylee at times.

26:26.433 --> 26:28.967
Like I try to work with
her personality.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.266
Um, like, you know,
I mean, I tiptoed.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.767
- Delancey from Little Rock,
Arkansas

26:35.800 --> 26:37.467
has an interesting question.

26:37.500 --> 26:40.166
She texted us and said,
"How many sexual--

26:40.200 --> 26:42.567
How much sexual tension
was there

26:42.600 --> 26:44.800
between you and Chandler?

26:44.834 --> 26:48.066
And can you attribute those
hidden feelings to your beef?"

26:48.100 --> 26:49.433
- Are you ----ing kidding me?

26:49.467 --> 26:53.033
- Well, it's, uh,
Delancey, and not me.

26:53.066 --> 26:56.166
- I am not at all, never
was attracted to Chandler.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.600
- Okay.
All right.

26:58.633 --> 27:02.467
Um, how much sexual tension
was there between you and Ross

27:02.500 --> 27:03.533
that could have attributed to--

27:03.567 --> 27:06.100
- You know what's really funny
about all this

27:06.133 --> 27:10.734
is that every one of them
had problems with me,

27:10.767 --> 27:13.934
and every one of them,
except for Chandler,

27:13.967 --> 27:16.600
came to me for lovin'.

27:16.633 --> 27:19.667
And-- we're all drinking,
anyway.

27:19.700 --> 27:22.467
Like I can chalk it up to, like,
drinking, you know,

27:22.500 --> 27:26.166
and we're man and woman,
and we wanna, you know,

27:26.200 --> 27:30.333
hash it out sexually, but, um--
- You're getting so weird.

27:30.367 --> 27:31.667
You're getting so weird.

27:31.700 --> 27:34.233
- That's-that's one way
to get it done, I suppose.

27:34.266 --> 27:36.834
- Who tried to hook up with you?
- It was wild to me, by the way,

27:36.867 --> 27:41.066
back to, you know,
the world we live in on land,

27:41.100 --> 27:43.300
seeing you kissing Rhylee.

27:43.333 --> 27:46.000
You're her superior,
and it's like,

27:46.033 --> 27:51.066
but-but that is very common
on boats, right?

27:51.100 --> 27:54.700
I mean, it kind of doesn't
matter that a superior is kiss--

27:54.734 --> 27:56.667
Whereas if you were on land,

27:56.700 --> 28:00.033
it's an entirely different
situation, right?

28:00.066 --> 28:02.667
- With Ross, and it's funny
'cause you don't show

28:02.700 --> 28:05.633
every time Ross tried to
come at me, but I--

28:05.667 --> 28:07.767
- What?
- Really?

28:07.800 --> 28:08.767
- Really?
- No, you don't.

28:08.800 --> 28:09.767
And it--
- It was--

28:09.800 --> 28:11.800
it was more than the two
that we saw?

28:11.834 --> 28:12.967
- No, there was the two.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.066
It was the two, but you
didn't see the first time.

28:15.100 --> 28:16.834
- Oh, okay.
- And so--

28:16.867 --> 28:19.900
and here's the thing, is like,
I knew Ross--

28:19.934 --> 28:22.133
I knew you weren't trying to
be with me,

28:22.166 --> 28:25.266
and with my thing,
I didn't want to just hook up.

28:25.300 --> 28:27.000
You know, I'm-- I've--
Like I've said,

28:27.033 --> 28:29.500
I make the booty calls
when I want booty calls.
- Yes.

28:29.533 --> 28:31.567
- I didn't want a booty call.
- After the break...

28:31.600 --> 28:33.533
So the two of you
did not hook up?

28:33.567 --> 28:36.333
- He told me he did.
- When?

28:36.367 --> 28:38.700
♪♪♪

28:43.767 --> 28:44.233
- The weather in Tahiti

28:44.233 --> 28:44.600
- The weather in Tahiti
was at times rough,

28:45.500 --> 28:47.433
but it was more than the waves

28:47.467 --> 28:50.767
that had the crews bunk beds
a-rockin'.

28:50.800 --> 28:54.133
Take a look at the romances
on the high sea.

28:58.266 --> 29:00.567
- When I'm out,
and picking up women,

29:00.600 --> 29:01.633
it's the law of averages.

29:01.667 --> 29:03.100
You're bound to
come around somewhere

29:03.133 --> 29:04.867
if you're trying
50 women at once.

29:04.900 --> 29:06.533
- Ashton, you gotta do
what you need to do.

29:06.567 --> 29:11.400
- Good luck!
You're welcome.

29:11.433 --> 29:12.867
[moaning]

29:12.900 --> 29:16.567
- Oh, my god!
- Yeah, boi!

29:16.600 --> 29:20.133
- Yeah, you first.
[laughing]

29:22.633 --> 29:26.300
It's not a relationship.
It's just drunken making out.

29:26.333 --> 29:28.600
- You're rooming with Rhy-Rhy.

29:28.633 --> 29:30.633
This is Rhylee.
This is Tyler.

29:30.667 --> 29:32.467
- Tyler, nice to see you.

29:32.500 --> 29:35.000
I get a hot new roommate.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.200
- Me and Tyler.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.433
- Next fall, after fire season,

29:42.467 --> 29:43.834
I think I'm gonna go try
and find a boat.

29:43.867 --> 29:46.734
- I mean, my fishing skills
and your sailing skills.

29:46.767 --> 29:48.200
- My plan was my own boat.

29:48.233 --> 29:51.133
Let me tell you the quickest way
to scare me off.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.700
By forcing yourself
into my future plans.

29:53.734 --> 29:56.300
So are you single or taken?
- Um, I'm single.

29:56.333 --> 29:57.600
- We're gonna get along
just fine.

29:57.633 --> 29:59.700
- This is so refreshing
and so nice.

29:59.734 --> 30:00.800
- Good, I'm glad.

30:06.700 --> 30:08.567
- Ew.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.367
- I'm not gonna be a tally
on your checklist.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.967
- I kind of just wanna see
how things go

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
and, like,
have them organically happen.
- Okay.

30:22.033 --> 30:24.867
So what's everyone's
relationship status now?

30:24.900 --> 30:28.333
Ashton and Laura...
- We're dear friends.

30:28.367 --> 30:31.700
- You're dear friends.
Okay, um--

30:31.734 --> 30:32.600
- Dear friends.

30:32.633 --> 30:34.166
- So, tonight,
just out of curiosity.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.800
So you're in
New York City tonight.

30:36.834 --> 30:39.333
How will the night end?
- We're dear friends.

30:39.367 --> 30:40.467
- Okay.

30:40.500 --> 30:46.066
Um, what about Rhylee and Tyler?
- We're dear friends.

30:46.100 --> 30:48.133
- One hundred percent--
- What?

30:48.166 --> 30:49.934
- Clubbin'.
- You're going clubbing.

30:49.967 --> 30:50.834
- Dear friends.

30:50.867 --> 30:51.667
- What were you guys doing
last night?

30:51.700 --> 30:52.567
- What were you up to
last night?

30:52.600 --> 30:53.367
- What were you guys up to
last night?

30:53.400 --> 30:54.467
- We were clubbin'.
- I-I was--

30:54.500 --> 30:55.533
- What were you clubbin'?

30:55.567 --> 30:56.867
- So the two of you
hooked up last night?

30:56.900 --> 30:58.400
- No.
- You didn't?

30:58.433 --> 30:59.400
[laughing]

30:59.433 --> 31:01.700
- Look at Rhyee's face.
- What?

31:01.734 --> 31:03.700
- You hooked up last night?
- No.

31:03.734 --> 31:06.433
- What?
- What?

31:06.467 --> 31:08.834
We were all hanging out
in my room last night.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.667
- Okay.
- Hanging out with Rhy.

31:10.700 --> 31:12.367
- Ashton and Laura,
there have been

31:12.400 --> 31:15.400
conflicting reports
about what happened, uh,

31:15.433 --> 31:17.133
in the crow's nest.
- Yes.

31:17.166 --> 31:18.600
- Did you guys hook up
that night?

31:18.633 --> 31:20.467
- No, actually, we didn't.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.033
- That's an interesting thing,
Andy, is,

31:22.066 --> 31:24.200
I didn't have sex
on the whole season

31:24.233 --> 31:27.033
right until the end.
So, like--

31:27.066 --> 31:30.133
- Well, no, but what about
with the French girl in the van?

31:30.166 --> 31:31.066
- What happened in the van?

31:31.100 --> 31:33.300
- I didn't have sex with her.
- Why not?

31:33.333 --> 31:36.333
- What do you consider sex?
[laughing]

31:36.367 --> 31:38.467
You were making her moan
with pleasure.

31:38.500 --> 31:41.433
- Yeah, but you don't only
use your dick for those things.

31:41.467 --> 31:42.834
- You got naked.
- Oh.

31:42.867 --> 31:44.000
- Ashton.
- Okay.

31:44.033 --> 31:46.400
- I hadn't slept with anybody
right up until the end.

31:46.433 --> 31:47.233
- Stop saying that.

31:47.266 --> 31:48.467
- Who did you sleep with
at the end?

31:48.500 --> 31:51.300
- Uh...
- Okay.

31:51.333 --> 31:54.367
So you and Laura
consummated at the end.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.133
- (BLEEP).

31:56.166 --> 31:58.033
- Kate, on the "Below Deck"
after show,

31:58.066 --> 32:01.667
you said that
Ross tried to kiss you.

32:01.700 --> 32:05.133
Is there anymore to that story?
- We were all partying and--

32:05.166 --> 32:06.300
- Maybe.
- Shut up!

32:06.333 --> 32:09.166
- No, I don't think he even,
like, knew it was me.

32:09.200 --> 32:13.667
[laughter]
- That was news to me, honestly.

32:13.700 --> 32:15.300
Yeah, I was-- yeah.
One of those nights.

32:15.333 --> 32:16.567
- He's a very lovey--

32:16.600 --> 32:18.367
- The only person
you didn't try and kiss.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.100
- Yeah, I get a bit
too lovey sometimes

32:20.133 --> 32:21.867
when I drink a bit too much.

32:21.900 --> 32:23.900
- So, the two of you
did not hook up?

32:23.934 --> 32:26.500
- No.
- Weak.

32:26.533 --> 32:29.000
- Yet.
[laughter]

32:29.033 --> 32:31.467
- You told me you did.
- When?

32:31.500 --> 32:33.133
- When we were in L.A.

32:33.166 --> 32:35.467
- That was-that was
someone else.

32:35.500 --> 32:36.467
- It was someone else.

32:36.500 --> 32:39.066
It was another
"Below Deck" person?

32:39.100 --> 32:42.266
- There isn't any-- Oh!
- Hannah.

32:42.300 --> 32:44.700
- Hey.
- Oh, yeah.

32:44.734 --> 32:47.100
- Yep.
- You hooked up with Hannah.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.066
- Did you get whiplash?
- I believe so.

32:49.100 --> 32:52.433
- You believe so?
- Yeah.

32:52.467 --> 32:54.133
It was just a friendly kiss,
that's all.

32:54.166 --> 32:57.367
Like, you know, when I'm kissin'
everyone else, apparently.

32:57.400 --> 32:58.667
- Just the homie.
- Just the homie.

32:58.700 --> 33:02.767
- Rhylee and Tyler, you two
clearly had great chemistry.

33:02.800 --> 33:05.934
Uh, what did you first see
in each other?

33:05.967 --> 33:08.834
- Her eyes.
- He's so stupid.

33:08.867 --> 33:10.200
- Uh, were you--

33:10.233 --> 33:13.533
when you watched back
the episode, Rhylee,

33:13.567 --> 33:18.066
when you saw Tyler saying,
"The worst thing, you know,

33:18.100 --> 33:20.834
"to say to me is start
making plans for the future",

33:20.867 --> 33:22.333
how did that make you feel?

33:22.367 --> 33:24.533
- Well, you know, it's really
funny that he said that,

33:24.567 --> 33:26.633
because I think he was being
a dick when he said it.

33:26.667 --> 33:28.467
'Cause I also had the
conversation with him that,

33:28.500 --> 33:32.200
I'm not sitting there writing
Mrs. Rhylee Rowland out

33:32.233 --> 33:33.266
on a notebook.

33:33.300 --> 33:34.533
- I've been working on
this idea,

33:34.567 --> 33:36.667
and I've been doing it
for my entire 20's.

33:36.700 --> 33:38.734
And it was, like--
that was--

33:38.767 --> 33:41.166
I guess I just felt like
that was my deal.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.500
- You-- first of all,
there was no idea,

33:43.533 --> 33:45.066
like, business plan.

33:45.100 --> 33:47.400
You said you-you want
your own sailboat.

33:47.433 --> 33:48.633
Like, that-that was it.

33:48.667 --> 33:50.667
I feel like
a lot of the pressure--

33:50.700 --> 33:53.333
and this I voiced to you
I think--

33:53.367 --> 33:57.400
is that they were very--
the crew was very good about

33:57.433 --> 33:59.400
putting us through
the gauntlet of truth

33:59.433 --> 34:00.734
or whatever.
- (BLEEP).

34:00.767 --> 34:02.600
- It was like, every time, like,
Tyler or I showed up,

34:02.633 --> 34:05.500
it was like,
"So, how do you feel
about Tyler?"

34:05.533 --> 34:06.433
And then--
- Right, they were--

34:06.467 --> 34:07.500
- And then it was, like,
the [indistinct].

34:07.533 --> 34:09.300
"Do you love Rhylee?"

34:09.333 --> 34:10.700
- This is a little bit
of semantics, guys.

34:10.734 --> 34:12.467
Let's-- it's tale
as old as time.

34:12.500 --> 34:14.333
You caught feelings.

34:14.367 --> 34:16.300
You just wanted to
hit it and quit it.

34:16.333 --> 34:18.133
And that's what happened.

34:18.166 --> 34:21.433
And I don't think that
you handled it very gentlemanly.

34:21.467 --> 34:22.533
- You have no idea--

34:22.567 --> 34:23.900
- Rhylee, Graham-Graham S.
from Dallas wants to know

34:23.934 --> 34:25.567
if it pissed you off that
your crewmates

34:25.600 --> 34:28.166
only hit on you
when they were wasted.

34:28.200 --> 34:30.734
- No, it doesn't--
like, we were all wasted.

34:30.767 --> 34:33.000
Like, that doesn't-that doesn't
piss me off that that was--

34:33.033 --> 34:36.333
I wasn't-- I didn't want them
to hit on me any other time.

34:36.367 --> 34:37.266
It's not like that.

34:37.300 --> 34:38.900
- The only thing
that doesn't piss you off.

34:38.934 --> 34:41.400
[laughter]

34:41.433 --> 34:44.400
- That's funny.
That's funny.

34:44.433 --> 34:45.667
Connor T. texted,

34:45.700 --> 34:49.133
"Ashton, did you even
consider Adrian competition

34:49.166 --> 34:53.633
"when it came to the two of you
pursuing Laura?"

34:53.667 --> 34:56.133
[laughing]

34:56.166 --> 34:57.500
- You can never
count somebody out.

34:57.533 --> 34:59.967
Um, but, I mean, it's fair game.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.367
You know,
as Adrian was saying,

35:01.400 --> 35:03.567
we had a-we actually had
a very good relationship,
him and I,

35:03.600 --> 35:05.333
as we were very honest
with each other.

35:05.367 --> 35:07.266
And we established that
from the beginning.

35:07.300 --> 35:09.066
Is we had just an open line
between us.

35:09.100 --> 35:10.600
- How does Laura feel
about that?

35:10.633 --> 35:13.367
- Fair game.
I don't--

35:13.400 --> 35:15.767
- Well, in-in early stages,
it is fair game.

35:15.800 --> 35:17.567
- Fair game?
- Of course.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.533
I had no claim on Laura from
when she got on to the boat.

35:19.567 --> 35:20.533
- Is this "Hunger Games?"

35:20.567 --> 35:22.667
Like, kind of.
Kind of.

35:22.700 --> 35:27.133
- The, uh--
Your terminology is amazing.
- Yeah.

35:27.166 --> 35:29.033
- I think he meant
dating is fair game.

35:29.066 --> 35:30.567
Not Laura, specifically.
- Yeah.

35:30.600 --> 35:31.800
- Yeah, yeah.
Exactly, yeah.

35:31.834 --> 35:32.800
- Right.
Okay.

35:32.834 --> 35:35.667
Adrian, are you still
in an open relationship?

35:35.700 --> 35:36.633
- No.
- No.

35:36.667 --> 35:39.400
- I'm currently single.

35:39.433 --> 35:42.867
- Coming up...
I have a surprise for you guys.

35:42.900 --> 35:46.200
Please welcome the cameraman
who saved Ashton.

35:46.233 --> 35:48.300
♪♪♪

35:53.433 --> 35:53.867
- We're gonna talk about

35:53.867 --> 35:54.166
- We're gonna talk about
Ashton's accident

35:55.033 --> 35:56.633
in just a minute,
but I wanna go around

35:56.667 --> 35:59.300
and find out what your biggest
regret of the season is,

35:59.333 --> 36:01.400
and what you're doing now.
Adrian.

36:01.433 --> 36:03.667
- Um, my biggest regret is
probably not being more mindful

36:03.700 --> 36:05.633
of my coworkers'
feelings at times.

36:05.667 --> 36:07.500
And now I'm working in New York.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.467
I'm working for
a private couple.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.467
- Tyler.
- No regrets.

36:11.500 --> 36:15.000
Had a blast.
And I'm living in New Orleans.

36:15.033 --> 36:15.767
- Rhylee.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.200
- Um, obviously,
my biggest regret

36:17.233 --> 36:23.633
is-is how I spoke to superiors.
Um, and right now,

36:23.667 --> 36:25.900
I've been working on
a couple different boats.

36:25.934 --> 36:28.333
- Um, probably my biggest regret
was the way that

36:28.367 --> 36:30.633
I handled Caroline's exit.

36:30.667 --> 36:32.500
Should have handled it
in a different way.

36:32.533 --> 36:34.567
And, um, I'm currently living
between Majorca, Spain,

36:34.600 --> 36:37.100
and Manchester as well.
- Kate.

36:37.133 --> 36:40.200
- Yeah, my biggest regret
is the childish way

36:40.233 --> 36:44.567
that I acted with Caroline.
Um, was not great to watch.

36:44.600 --> 36:45.633
And-- oh.

36:45.667 --> 36:47.467
I opened up a non-profit store
in my hometown

36:47.500 --> 36:49.700
about a year and a half ago.
- Laura.

36:49.734 --> 36:51.834
- My biggest regret
would definitely be, um,

36:51.867 --> 36:54.266
not hand-handling the situation
as I did with Kate.

36:54.300 --> 36:57.300
I should have, you know,
sat her down
like a professional.

36:57.333 --> 36:58.633
And, right now,
I'm living in Toronto,

36:58.667 --> 37:00.700
and I'm a full-time
yoga instructor and trainer.

37:00.734 --> 37:04.600
- Ashton.
- I don't have much regrets.

37:04.633 --> 37:07.133
Um, the accident was obviously
a big thing of my season.

37:07.166 --> 37:12.100
Um, I regret being, uh,
so unfocused at that point

37:12.133 --> 37:13.934
and allowing that
to happen to me.

37:13.967 --> 37:16.100
Um, but in the same breath,
I'm glad that it happened,

37:16.133 --> 37:17.333
because I think
there's a lot of learning

37:17.367 --> 37:19.467
that would have come from
that situation.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.266
Uh, what I'm currently do is

37:21.300 --> 37:24.834
I'm working for a family
in Atlanta, Georgia.

37:24.867 --> 37:26.066
I'm their private trainer.

37:26.100 --> 37:27.367
I do some security work
for them.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.700
I manage their estates.
- Ross.

37:29.734 --> 37:32.767
- I suppose trying to maybe
kiss everyone,

37:32.800 --> 37:34.300
and not being able to call--

37:34.333 --> 37:37.300
or recall those moments,
or remember those moments,
sorry.

37:37.333 --> 37:39.500
Um, I'm in Florida
at the moment, um,

37:39.533 --> 37:42.100
just spending time with my kid.
Trying to be a super dad.

37:42.133 --> 37:43.700
- Captain Lee.

37:43.734 --> 37:48.433
- I think my biggest regret
this season was the way I, uh,

37:48.467 --> 37:51.934
handled the situation
with Kate and, uh, Caroline.

37:51.967 --> 37:54.166
They still weren't
running boats.

37:54.200 --> 37:56.700
Probably will be
for a long time.
- Yeah.

37:56.734 --> 37:59.867
Now we are gonna take a look at
the scariest moment

37:59.900 --> 38:03.467
in "Below Deck" history.
Ashton's accident.

38:03.500 --> 38:06.166
Watch.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.767
- 'Kay, watch the lines,
watch the lines.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.033
Careful.
Oh, (BLEEP)!

38:09.066 --> 38:11.467
(BLEEP).

38:11.500 --> 38:13.467
- Man overboard.
- Take it off now.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.467
[screaming]
- Jesus Christ!

38:15.500 --> 38:18.867
- Ashton steps on the line.
And pulled him off the boat.

38:18.900 --> 38:22.000
Thank God for Brent,
the camera guy.

38:22.033 --> 38:25.033
Ashton owes Brent his life.

38:25.066 --> 38:26.500
- Just puts life
into perspective.

38:26.533 --> 38:28.367
It's like, one minute,
you're here.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.133
One minute, you're gone.
- Are you okay?

38:30.166 --> 38:31.633
- Get his ass on board.

38:31.667 --> 38:34.300
We were within 30 seconds
of him dying.

38:34.333 --> 38:36.367
I don't know
how I'd deal with that.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.467
I need a minute.

38:38.500 --> 38:41.600
- I've been given
a second chance here.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.800
- Well, I have a surprise
for you guys.

38:47.834 --> 38:51.533
Uh, please welcome the cameraman
who saved Ashton's life.

38:51.567 --> 38:55.834
Brent Freeburg is here.
[cheers and applause]

38:55.867 --> 38:58.734
- Hey, man.
- What's up, bro?

38:58.767 --> 39:01.500
- How are ya?
- I'm good, thanks to you.

39:01.533 --> 39:04.233
- Look at that handsome foot.
- It's good looking, right?

39:04.266 --> 39:05.433
- Hey, Brent.
- Hello.

39:05.467 --> 39:07.300
- How are you doing?
- I'm good.

39:07.333 --> 39:09.800
Hi, everybody.
- It's so great to meet you.

39:09.834 --> 39:11.767
First of all, this is
the first time the two of you

39:11.800 --> 39:14.100
have seen each other
since the show wrapped, right?

39:14.133 --> 39:15.200
- Yeah. Yeah.

39:15.233 --> 39:17.800
- Is there-is there anything
you wanna say to him?

39:17.834 --> 39:22.467
- Uh, just--
I mean, it's overwhelming.

39:22.500 --> 39:24.166
- It sure is.
- Um, you know, it's--

39:24.200 --> 39:27.133
this whole rewatching everything
has been

39:27.166 --> 39:30.800
extremely overwhelming for me
to have to relive that moment.

39:30.834 --> 39:32.467
I've really reflected
on the situation.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.667
Everything that I've done
up until now,

39:34.700 --> 39:36.967
and everything I've managed
to keep doing in my life

39:37.000 --> 39:38.333
is because of this man
sitting here.

39:38.367 --> 39:40.867
And it's--
what do you say to somebody?

39:40.900 --> 39:43.066
You know, like,
he is my real life hero.

39:43.100 --> 39:44.033
He really is.

39:44.066 --> 39:46.433
I hope that I can do something
with my life

39:46.467 --> 39:47.767
that will make him proud
one day.

39:47.800 --> 39:50.300
That he can say, you know,
"Thank God
I saved that guy's life

39:50.333 --> 39:53.400
"because look what
he's doing with himself."

39:53.433 --> 39:56.800
- That's nice.
- Thank you.

39:56.834 --> 39:58.467
- Tell me what happened
that day, Brent.

39:58.500 --> 40:00.133
- Well, I would say
that it wasn't just me.

40:00.166 --> 40:01.767
I've been getting
a lot of attention for sure.

40:01.800 --> 40:05.333
Um, but it was Rhylee who made
the first call to Captain.

40:05.367 --> 40:07.433
Captain took the boat
out of gear.

40:07.467 --> 40:09.300
Ross, who helped
untie the lines.

40:09.333 --> 40:11.066
And so, it was really
collectively all of us

40:11.100 --> 40:12.867
that came together,
you know.

40:12.900 --> 40:15.467
- But you're here
not to work on the boat.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.500
You're here shooting a TV show.

40:17.533 --> 40:19.333
So you're standing there
shooting this,

40:19.367 --> 40:21.567
and at some point,
you make the call,

40:21.600 --> 40:23.200
I gotta put my camera down.

40:23.233 --> 40:25.567
- Ross was working on-on
doing a cot line

40:25.600 --> 40:26.834
on one of the fenders behind me.

40:26.867 --> 40:30.266
And I noticed that Rhylee and
Ashton were down on the deck.

40:30.300 --> 40:33.600
On the swim deck.
And I just saw him go in.

40:33.633 --> 40:37.100
And, um, so I immediately
went down there.

40:37.133 --> 40:41.200
And then... basically assessed
the situation in the moment.

40:41.233 --> 40:43.100
You know, how do we
get these ropes off?

40:43.133 --> 40:44.400
Like, do I dive in?

40:44.433 --> 40:47.066
Does somebody dive in and go,
like, try to, like, unhook him?

40:47.100 --> 40:48.734
No, that's not gonna work.

40:48.767 --> 40:50.667
Is there a knife?
No.

40:50.700 --> 40:52.300
So, I just looked at the cleats

40:52.333 --> 40:53.900
and I realized that
that was the solution.

40:53.934 --> 40:55.166
And then started doing that.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.967
And I think Ross had come down
at that point

40:57.000 --> 40:58.467
and was just like,
"Get these lines off."

40:58.500 --> 41:01.700
And then after we got 'em off,
pick up the camera

41:01.734 --> 41:03.100
and then start shooting again.

41:03.133 --> 41:06.467
- So, what--
how long was all that?

41:06.500 --> 41:08.367
- I think--
- 15 seconds.

41:08.400 --> 41:10.233
- No, it was longer.
- It was actually longer.

41:10.266 --> 41:11.667
- He was in the water,
under the water,

41:11.700 --> 41:13.667
for maybe 25 seconds, I bet.

41:13.700 --> 41:15.834
Just struggling himself,
trying to get untied.

41:15.867 --> 41:18.433
- I-I had got to that point
where I had mentally prepared

41:18.467 --> 41:20.300
that my foot
was gonna be ripped off.

41:20.333 --> 41:23.700
That-that's the force that
was already around my ankle.

41:23.734 --> 41:25.900
You were--
if there was two seconds longer,

41:25.934 --> 41:29.133
my foot was-was ripped off.
- Wow.

41:29.166 --> 41:30.834
Makes you emotional
to hear about.

41:30.867 --> 41:32.800
- Yeah, every time
I tell the story,

41:32.834 --> 41:34.800
I get all super anxious.
I mean--

41:34.834 --> 41:37.233
- Well, if-if Rhylee
hadn't said "man overboard"

41:37.266 --> 41:39.467
in that instance,
it was all over.

41:39.500 --> 41:46.300
- Lee, you have, uh, been in
this industry for how long?

41:46.333 --> 41:47.400
- 35 years.

41:47.433 --> 41:50.033
- And this accident rates
where in the 35 years?

41:50.066 --> 41:51.600
- At the top.
- At the top.

41:51.633 --> 41:53.133
- At the top.
- What do you wanna say?

41:53.166 --> 41:57.500
- It never-- it's never, ever
happened in my career before.

41:57.533 --> 42:00.500
And, hopefully,
it will never happen again.

42:00.533 --> 42:04.300
- What do you wanna say to him?

42:04.333 --> 42:07.567
- Like I've always told him
before, he's a stud.

42:07.600 --> 42:10.433
- You're the real stud
of the sea, Captain Lee.

42:10.467 --> 42:13.767
- Come here, buddy.

42:19.867 --> 42:24.500
- Ashton, how-how
did this change you?

42:24.533 --> 42:27.300
- It was a massive wakeup call.

42:27.333 --> 42:30.100
Um, I think you get complacent.

42:30.133 --> 42:31.867
You start forgetting things
on deck.

42:31.900 --> 42:35.600
Um, it's a dangerous job we do.

42:35.633 --> 42:38.900
Um, and I think it was just
a massive wakeup call.

42:38.934 --> 42:41.967
- Um, I'm so glad
you-you joined us.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.734
I know you're pretty, uh--

42:43.767 --> 42:47.233
from what I understand,
you like to stay
behind the scenes.

42:47.266 --> 42:49.000
- There's a reason
that I be behind the camera.

42:49.033 --> 42:50.500
- Yes.
[laughter]

42:50.533 --> 42:53.333
And this wasn't your choice,
your first choice to be here.

42:53.367 --> 42:55.400
But we begged you
and begged you.

42:55.433 --> 42:58.133
So, it's--
we're all so happy to see you.

42:58.166 --> 42:59.166
- I'm happy to be here.

42:59.200 --> 43:01.166
- Thanks for a great
charter season, everybody.

43:01.200 --> 43:03.266
See ya next time.

43:03.300 --> 43:10.433
