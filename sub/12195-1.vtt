WEBVTT

00:36.437 --> 00:37.770
I'll be right back.

00:46.279 --> 00:51.450
Adam Mitchell,

00:51.452 --> 00:55.320
I think of you fondly.

00:57.090 --> 00:58.624
No, that's stupid.
Um...

01:03.163 --> 01:04.430
I love you.

01:06.599 --> 01:08.634
I've always loved you.

01:13.773 --> 01:17.476
"You look beautiful,
Cassie."

01:17.478 --> 01:19.144
I don't know
what's happening.

01:19.146 --> 01:22.214
This is the only thing

01:22.216 --> 01:24.349
that you should be
wearing right now.

01:27.554 --> 01:29.488
Chester,
have you seen Cassie?

01:29.490 --> 01:33.525
-Um...
-Are you moist?

01:34.861 --> 01:36.662
It's supposed to help.

01:36.664 --> 01:41.433
I don't--
i think so.

01:41.435 --> 01:45.437
Good enough.
Okay, just-- let's get--

01:45.439 --> 01:47.239
I can't get it in.

01:47.241 --> 01:51.276
It's kind of, um, squishy.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.579
Are you sure
you're ready?

01:53.581 --> 01:55.447
Yeah.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.349
I was born ready.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.852
Hey. Hey, Adam.

01:59.854 --> 02:01.854
Adam, it's okay.

02:01.856 --> 02:04.423
It's a lot of pressure.

02:04.425 --> 02:07.292
Hey. Hey, Adam,

02:07.294 --> 02:09.761
Adam, it's okay.

02:09.763 --> 02:13.398
It's just us.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.733
I...

02:18.138 --> 02:20.906
-I--
-i need to pee.

02:20.908 --> 02:21.874
Maybe.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.749
We could always
try again later.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.653
Adam?

02:34.655 --> 02:36.421
Are you freaking
kidding me?

02:38.625 --> 02:40.893
Get out of
my parent's bed,
you tramp!

02:44.364 --> 02:45.697
Uh, Adam?

02:45.699 --> 02:48.700
Adam, my clothes
are in there.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.802
Adam. Adam, please.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.671
Get out of my house
before I call the police.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.940
-For what?
-For stuff.

02:54.942 --> 02:57.276
I don't know.
Whore.

02:58.511 --> 03:01.813
--What a whore!

03:01.815 --> 03:03.448
Where are you going, slut?

03:04.817 --> 03:06.952
--What are you doing?

03:06.954 --> 03:10.455
Come on,
the party just started.
Stay awhile.

03:14.827 --> 03:16.328
-Um...
-Oh, my god.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.930
What a little tramp.

03:19.966 --> 03:21.633
Bye!

03:28.675 --> 03:30.676
Hey.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.678
Cassie cranston,
is that you?

03:32.680 --> 03:34.947
-Shit!
-Did you just say "shit"?

03:42.722 --> 03:44.990
Jesus, Seth.

03:44.992 --> 03:47.426
-That's my mom's.
-I'll bring it back.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.361
Okay.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.568
Lana Parker
called me about you,

03:56.570 --> 04:00.672
said you streaked
through her backyard.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.474
And she wasn't
the only one.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.276
All of beaver's Ridge
is abuzz about you.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.345
It was so horrible, mom.
They all--

04:06.347 --> 04:09.514
don't say another word.

04:09.516 --> 04:11.550
You embarrassed me tonight.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.852
You embarrassed yourself.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.454
Please, mom, I'm--

04:15.456 --> 04:17.389
don't you care
what others think of you?

04:20.392 --> 04:22.594
Don't you?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.029
Oh, stop sulking.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.598
Go in the house
before anyone sees you.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.767
Unless you can
think of another way you can
mortify me tonight.

04:55.895 --> 04:57.296
Fuck, yeah.

05:19.452 --> 05:20.619
Hey, Ellie.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.454
Sorry I missed
all your calls.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.456
I have your pages,
i just, um--

05:24.458 --> 05:27.626
Cassie, uh,
it's your mom.

05:27.628 --> 05:30.996
-Oh, Christ, what now?
-She passed.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.831
Well, good.
I didn't want her writing
the forward, anyway.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.033
-That was your idea.
-No, um,

05:35.035 --> 05:36.368
she's gone.

05:38.104 --> 05:39.438
On tour?

05:41.107 --> 05:44.710
No. I'm sorry, Cassie.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.044
I know the two of you
weren't very close,

05:46.046 --> 05:47.979
but, um, look,

05:47.981 --> 05:52.117
I, uh, still need
that manuscript from you

05:52.119 --> 05:53.652
as soon as possible.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.821
But, um,

05:55.823 --> 05:58.023
you know,
take a few days.

05:59.826 --> 06:01.727
Go home.

07:19.205 --> 07:21.506
Afternoon, Adam.
How are you doing?

07:21.508 --> 07:23.675
-Good, good.
-You're looking very good.
Looking fit.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.877
I just want to talk
to you about the apple butter
festival this year.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.579
-Yeah.
-'Cause last year the judging
got some complaints.

07:27.581 --> 07:28.847
-Yeah.
-Are you in this year?

07:28.849 --> 07:30.649
-Absolutely.
'Cause you'd make a great judge.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.551
-You love apple butter,
don't you?
-I love apple butter.

07:34.887 --> 07:38.757
Oh, you've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.025
If you're here
for the tour,

07:40.027 --> 07:41.226
Justin's taking one out now.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.928
Yeah.
Uh, Mr. thicodedious,

07:42.930 --> 07:44.696
have you got
your Insulin this time?

07:44.698 --> 07:47.599
All right, now,
for our first stop,
everybody,

07:47.601 --> 07:50.101
it's gonna be
the church that inspired

07:50.103 --> 07:53.638
the exciting conclusion
to the fifth Victoria novel...

07:54.875 --> 07:56.174
I'm not here for the tour.

07:56.176 --> 07:59.811
I just wanted
to check the place out.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.113
It's cool.

08:02.115 --> 08:05.584
Holy fuck.
You're Cassie cranston.

08:05.586 --> 08:09.621
I'm-- I'm literally reading
your column right now.

08:09.623 --> 08:13.792
-It's like my Bible.
-Thank you.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.126
That's a good one.

08:15.128 --> 08:17.496
How's that working out for you?

08:17.498 --> 08:18.897
Oh, it's-- yeah.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.632
No, it's like-- not really.
It's fine.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.501
-Oh.
-I'm sorry, I just--

08:22.503 --> 08:24.236
I never thought that I would
get to meet you.

08:24.238 --> 08:26.538
I saw you the night

08:26.540 --> 08:28.540
that you went through town

08:28.542 --> 08:30.876
with-- with your tits and stuff
and it just--

08:32.513 --> 08:34.980
it blew my mind, and, uh,
and every time,

08:34.982 --> 08:37.249
I just get
fed up with this place,
i read your first article

08:37.251 --> 08:39.116
that you ever wrote-- the one
that made people hate you,

08:39.119 --> 08:41.219
and, like,
it's so comforting to me.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.188
"Dear beaver's Ridge,
the following article
has been formatted

08:44.191 --> 08:46.191
to fit your
narrow and oppressed view
of the universe."

08:46.193 --> 08:48.293
It is a great opening line.
It's so epic.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.295
Thank you.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.197
What are you doing here?

08:52.199 --> 08:55.600
Well, my mom died, so...

08:55.602 --> 08:57.235
Fuck and shit.

08:57.237 --> 09:00.171
Hey, you wouldn't
happen to know

09:00.173 --> 09:02.674
who the wills and estates
lawyer is?

09:02.676 --> 09:05.277
I do. Um, yes.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.015
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.650
Oh, god.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.687
Nice to meet you.
Thank you so much.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.155
Bye.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.259
Fuck.

09:35.341 --> 09:36.775
Why can't we show it today?

09:36.777 --> 09:38.109
Well, the town's
national treasure died.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.744
People are super sad
and stuff.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.846
No one wants to buy a house
when they're sad.

09:44.817 --> 09:47.185
It's listed too high.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.887
In the city, we'd list it
25 percent lower.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.221
It starts a bidding war.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.856
No. See?
There's no bidding wars here.

09:51.858 --> 09:54.159
What you do is,
you go 25 percent higher,

09:54.161 --> 09:56.194
and then people think
they're getting a bargain

09:56.196 --> 09:58.096
when they Jew us down.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.801
I'm Jewish.

10:06.038 --> 10:08.340
-I'm sorry.
-Don't apologize.

10:08.342 --> 10:11.076
Just don't
say that in front
of clients,

10:11.078 --> 10:12.978
unless small-town bigotry
is something that...

10:12.980 --> 10:14.679
Binds the town together.

10:14.681 --> 10:17.015
Kind of.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.217
Although we do have a major
that's a paki.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.252
So, or paki...
He's a paki-- Pakistan.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.921
Pakistan-- Pakistani.

10:22.923 --> 10:25.390
Is that what you call
those people?

10:25.392 --> 10:26.925
Look, the main selling point

10:26.927 --> 10:28.760
of all the homes
in beaver's Ridge,

10:28.762 --> 10:31.930
is that you're coming
to a community, you know?

10:31.932 --> 10:33.732
It's wholesome,

10:33.734 --> 10:35.400
those family values.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.769
You know, the kind of place
maybe you could see yourself

10:37.771 --> 10:41.406
setting up
your own little family.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.308
- Are you fucking
shitting me?

10:43.310 --> 10:44.976
Oh, hey, Bruce.

10:46.912 --> 10:48.413
Hey, buddy.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.782
I told you I was bringing
my new partner by today!

10:50.784 --> 10:52.784
Was that today?
What time--

10:52.786 --> 10:54.719
oh, I'm sorry
that slipped my mind.

10:54.721 --> 10:58.056
So you're the home owners?

10:58.058 --> 11:01.159
-This is my wife.
-Nah, uh, hah, ex-wife.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.261
Temporary separation, Alice.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.363
Until you get off your ass
and sign the papers.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.866
-This is my house!
-Oh, my goodness.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.235
It's not.
It's my house.

11:10.237 --> 11:13.004
Why don't you get
your shit out of it?

11:21.313 --> 11:23.848
I will rip the batteries
out of that game thing

11:23.850 --> 11:25.116
so fast,
your head is gonna spin.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.252
Stop treating me
like a child, mom.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.953
Take this casserole
over to Maureen's.

11:28.955 --> 11:31.189
-No one's even there.
-If that little tramp

11:31.191 --> 11:34.726
daughter of hers turns up,
she'll need food.

11:34.728 --> 11:38.163
- Did you make me one of these?
- -This is the house

11:38.165 --> 11:40.732
where Maureen
wrote every single one
of the books.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.133
Okay, now it's also

11:42.135 --> 11:45.470
the inspiration
for Victoria's childhood home.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.238
And this tree right here,
folks,

11:47.240 --> 11:51.076
this is the tree
where Victoria had her
first kiss.

11:51.078 --> 11:55.146
Also, the tree where Mr. cobell
proposed marriage.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.951
- Sorry about your mom.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.921
Go ahead and take some photos
if you want.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.856
Thanks, Seth.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.463
Do you play
father-daughter warfare?

12:11.465 --> 12:13.131
I have no idea
what that is.

13:12.324 --> 13:15.260
Ovulation begins
in t-minus five days.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.362
Now, I've given
your secretary the itinerary,

13:17.364 --> 13:18.463
and she's freed
your schedule

13:18.465 --> 13:19.898
for the corresponding times.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.299
Those are non-negotiable.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.967
3:00 P.M.
means 3:00 P.M.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.102
Not quarter after.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.970
I'm sorry
i was late today.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.472
Now, when you walk in that door,
i want you to be fully aroused.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.374
Okay, sweetheart?

13:29.376 --> 13:31.576
Fully aroused, yeah.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.344
This is fun, huh?

13:33.346 --> 13:35.880
-Sweetie, this
isn't for enjoyment.
-Right.

13:35.882 --> 13:38.216
You know, the doctor said
that we need to keep a steady
flow of semen going

13:38.218 --> 13:40.385
to maximize our chances
for when the time comes.

13:40.387 --> 13:43.087
We don't want to be
the only 30-year-olds in town
without a child, do we?

13:43.089 --> 13:45.023
Uh-uh.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.324
We just need to keep
the semen schedule. Okay?

13:46.326 --> 13:48.293
- All right.

13:50.596 --> 13:52.130
Adam, we need to finish.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.832
That's my work ring though.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.033
--Oh! God, Connie!

13:55.035 --> 13:56.868
Oh, my god.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.170
Can I just answer it real quick,
and I'll get back to you?

14:00.440 --> 14:02.240
Okay.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.512
Adam Mitchell.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.347
Hi.

14:09.349 --> 14:13.218
Uh...
It's Cassie cranston.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.619
Uh, uh, hi.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.288
So, you're a lawyer.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.525
Um-- uh, honey,
it's um, it's-- it's super dry.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.167
Um, wills and estates,
mostly, yeah.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.402
When did you
get back into town?

14:31.404 --> 14:34.205
Just now.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.375
-The library's gone, huh?
-Yeah, yeah.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.477
It burned to the ground
about eight years ago.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.479
It was a huge fire.
It was a terrible tragedy.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.916
Those poor schoolchildren
with nothing to do with
their free time.

14:46.652 --> 14:49.254
Uh, right. So,

14:49.256 --> 14:51.256
I need to plan
the funeral.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.657
Oh, I did that already.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.525
I did it all by myself.
Oh, god--

15:07.106 --> 15:08.439
sorry, where were we?

15:08.441 --> 15:11.409
-Everything okay over there?
-Yeah.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.979
I'm, uh-- I'm--
I'm glad you're in town.

15:14.981 --> 15:17.148
Why?

15:17.150 --> 15:18.650
Well, you know,
you're next of kin,

15:18.652 --> 15:21.052
you got to sign the, uh,
documents-- relevant documents,

15:21.054 --> 15:23.321
there's all sorts of stuff,
and, uh,

15:23.323 --> 15:26.224
I mean, I just always
kind of assumed you would
never be coming home.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.560
Well, my mom died.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.129
I mean,
why wouldn't I come home?

15:31.131 --> 15:34.299
-'Cause of the article?
-Yeah, right, of course.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.302
So, when do we read
the will?

15:37.304 --> 15:38.603
After the funeral.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.004
Right.

15:42.174 --> 15:45.043
Okay, well I've bothered
you after business hours,

15:45.045 --> 15:47.512
so, I'll let you
get back to your wife.

15:47.514 --> 15:50.481
-I assume you're married.
-Oh, yeah, actually.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.552
Okay, uh, well, uh,
thanks for everything.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.120
You actually know my wi--

15:57.323 --> 15:59.390
--sweetie, we talk about

15:59.392 --> 16:03.261
you warning me before you
release your demons.

16:03.263 --> 16:06.564
That face you make
it's like staring into the sun.

16:07.733 --> 16:09.200
A lot of that is involuntary.

16:22.348 --> 16:23.748
You didn't call.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.318
What was I supposed to say?

16:31.057 --> 16:33.324
You will now have
a passage

16:33.326 --> 16:37.095
from Maureen's
first Victoria book read by
Heather Mitchell,

16:37.097 --> 16:41.366
president of
the Victoria of the true north
festival committee.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.705
"Victoria had always
been aware,

16:47.707 --> 16:50.141
ever since
her first memories,

16:50.143 --> 16:54.178
that she was very near
to a world of deviant morality.

16:56.315 --> 17:00.718
But sometimes,
just for a moment,

17:00.720 --> 17:04.088
her loved ones neared it,
and she caught a glimpse,

17:04.089 --> 17:06.691
of the bewitching
world beyond,

17:06.693 --> 17:09.527
and she knew
that it would be
her life's work...

17:11.064 --> 17:13.263
To keep herself
and others from it."

17:16.069 --> 17:18.136
I hate everything.

17:22.207 --> 17:25.076
Remember when you
left me here alone with all
of these people?

17:25.078 --> 17:27.678
The sooner
i get out of here,
the better.

17:27.680 --> 17:31.215
-She just had
to show up today.
-Oh, my god.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.651
-It's her mother's funeral.
-Oh, button it.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.521
-I'm gonna go give her
a piece of my mind.
-Honey, don't--

17:36.523 --> 17:39.490
is this really the best place
for a confrontation like this?

17:40.659 --> 17:43.361
Cassie cranston.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.329
Heather Murray.

17:45.331 --> 17:47.632
Or, is it Mitchell now?

17:47.634 --> 17:50.334
On behalf of beaver's Ridge
welcoming committee,

17:50.336 --> 17:51.836
I would like to formally
let you know

17:51.838 --> 17:54.205
that you are not welcome.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.307
That is,
you are not welcome here.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.809
Wow.

17:57.811 --> 18:00.445
As far as condolences go,
that was original.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.779
Did I go something?

18:01.781 --> 18:04.449
You did something
to this entire town.

18:04.451 --> 18:07.452
Right, the article.
Is that it?

18:07.454 --> 18:10.088
You may have grown up here,
but you know nothing about us.

18:10.090 --> 18:14.659
I mean, we get up to some
pretty wild shenanigans.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.495
Like what?

18:17.497 --> 18:19.363
The true north festival?

18:19.365 --> 18:21.199
- The apple butter parade?

18:21.201 --> 18:22.533
Hey, I don't mean
to butt in here,

18:22.535 --> 18:24.235
but I will not stand
idly by,

18:24.237 --> 18:27.205
while you trash talk
the apple butter parade.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.706
Bruce, everybody,
can we just please give
Cassie a break?

18:28.708 --> 18:31.542
Whose side are you on,
really, Adam?

18:31.544 --> 18:34.645
Wipe that smile off your face.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.348
You think you're
the only one who's had
a little excitement?

18:37.350 --> 18:39.784
Well, let me tell you,
i have had my share

18:39.786 --> 18:42.353
-of excitement.
-Okay. Do tell.

18:43.889 --> 18:46.691
I slept with a black man
in college.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.127
My stars.

18:49.129 --> 18:49.127
Ever been with a woman?

18:51.864 --> 18:53.831
I kissed a girl once,
i didn't care for it.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.600
Sex tape?

18:55.602 --> 18:57.702
We make them,
and watch them often.
Big whoop.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.871
Anything else?

18:59.873 --> 19:01.806
Have you ever
been in an orgy?

19:04.577 --> 19:05.676
I'm sorry.

19:12.351 --> 19:13.684
Hey, you know, hon',

19:13.686 --> 19:15.653
it's been
kind of a rough day,

19:15.655 --> 19:17.288
we've got a little time
before dinner,

19:17.290 --> 19:20.424
maybe we could, uh,
you know...

19:20.426 --> 19:23.394
-I'm not ovulating.
-Yeah, I know, I know.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.364
I just thought
maybe we could, uh,
have a little fun.

19:26.366 --> 19:29.167
Oh, sweetie--

19:29.169 --> 19:31.469
no. Fun time was yesterday

19:31.471 --> 19:34.305
just-- just like
the schedule says,
remember?

19:34.307 --> 19:37.175
You just have to keep
your-- your sperm fresh.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.543
You don't need me for that.

19:38.545 --> 19:41.712
Besides, it--
it really turns me on

19:41.714 --> 19:45.449
to think of you
doing that to yourself.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.718
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.587
Yeah, I could do that.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.756
-Hey, you wanna watch?
-Mm-mm.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.791
No, that's okay,
that's okay. Yeah.

20:07.406 --> 20:09.240
You look beautiful, Cassie.

20:10.976 --> 20:13.511
It's okay.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.313
It's just us.

20:16.815 --> 20:18.983
It's always
been just us.

20:18.985 --> 20:22.486
-But I ran away.
-You're not going
anywhere now.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.525
Are you freaking
kidding me?

20:52.684 --> 20:55.519
Ah! Ah! Ah!

21:01.026 --> 21:03.394
Well, the results say
that Adam suffers

21:03.396 --> 21:05.263
"from necrzoospermia,"

21:05.265 --> 21:08.299
which means
that all of his sperm
are non-viable.

21:08.301 --> 21:09.867
Which means dead.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.303
All of them?

21:12.305 --> 21:14.739
- There's really nothing we can do.
-Well, I'm sorry, doctor,

21:14.741 --> 21:17.308
I just don't know
what I'm supposed to do
in this situation.

21:17.310 --> 21:20.311
After all this time,
i know how frustrated
you must be.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.313
Look, the waiting list
for sperm banks

21:22.315 --> 21:25.583
and adoption agencies
are at least two to three years.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.753
If you want
my honest, completely
off-the-record opinion,

21:28.755 --> 21:30.488
if it were me,

21:30.490 --> 21:32.657
I would try to get a friend,
or someone I knew,

21:32.659 --> 21:34.959
to give me a personal
donation.

21:39.598 --> 21:41.999
First you folks
tell me what you paid for it.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.868
Then we'll have
a good laugh about it

21:43.870 --> 21:45.369
and we'll start
"jewing" them down.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.740
-The hell with it.
-Line one for
you, Bruce!

21:49.742 --> 21:51.042
Yes, thank you,
Georgina.

21:55.447 --> 21:57.882
-The buck stops here,
how can I help you?
-Bruce?

21:57.884 --> 21:59.684
-It's Heather Mitchell.
-You're the only
Heather in town.

21:59.686 --> 22:01.052
You don't need
to tell me your full name

22:01.054 --> 22:03.321
every single time
you call.

22:03.323 --> 22:04.755
You know.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.993
Not a lot
of funerals end with
an orgy throw-down.

22:12.432 --> 22:15.066
-I'd go to an orgy.
-No, you wouldn't.

22:15.068 --> 22:17.668
Yeah, I can grow
a mustache for it,

22:17.670 --> 22:20.438
- or a soul patch
-whatever.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.706
I'll have you know,
I'm an extremely

22:21.708 --> 22:24.375
-sexual person.
-Oh, my god.

22:24.377 --> 22:26.811
I had a sex dream
about you once.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.580
I don't want to know that.

22:29.582 --> 22:30.948
Do you have any idea
how many people

22:30.950 --> 22:33.484
I've had sex dreams about?

22:33.486 --> 22:36.120
It's hardly
an exclusive club, okay?

22:39.725 --> 22:42.426
So...
How was I?

22:44.731 --> 22:46.964
Oh, screw you!
Whatever.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.933
If I sucked,
it's probably because

22:48.935 --> 22:50.801
-you have
a shitty imagination.
-Okay, you know what?

22:50.803 --> 22:52.970
I knew you'd
be weird about this.
I knew you would be.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.139
You're my boss, dude,
and you babysat me once.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.375
-So.
-I think.

22:57.377 --> 22:59.043
It is actually
illegal for you to be into me,
or something.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.011
Okay, first of all,
i did not say I was into you,

23:01.013 --> 23:03.381
and secondly,
i didn't babysit you.

23:03.383 --> 23:06.050
We played videogames
while our moms smoked cigarettes
and played bridge.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.585
So, it doesn't...

23:07.587 --> 23:09.587
That's what guys do,
though, isn't it?

23:09.589 --> 23:12.022
They befriend a girl
just to gain her trust,

23:12.024 --> 23:13.958
so that they can
have sex with them.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.659
I mean, why else
are you friends with me?

23:15.661 --> 23:17.661
Must be your shining
personality.

23:17.663 --> 23:20.431
Your sarcastic tone
is unnecessary.

23:23.469 --> 23:25.469
Hey, Heather.
What's going on?

23:28.006 --> 23:29.673
In the matter
of the last will
and testament,

23:29.675 --> 23:33.611
of Maureen Margaret cranston...

23:33.613 --> 23:36.113
She has declared
that her residuals

23:36.115 --> 23:38.516
from any book sales,
which as you know

23:38.518 --> 23:40.184
are still quite
considerable,

23:40.186 --> 23:42.453
as well as any
assets that she has,

23:42.455 --> 23:44.755
financial institutions,
holdings, etcetera,

23:44.757 --> 23:49.460
be used to build
a new town library.

23:51.897 --> 23:55.633
Uh, I'm sorry.
What?

23:55.635 --> 23:57.635
She wants to build a library.

23:57.637 --> 23:58.969
Remember I told you
that the library burned down?

23:58.971 --> 24:00.671
I could show you
the blueprints, actually,

24:00.673 --> 24:01.939
if you give me
a second, here,

24:01.941 --> 24:03.941
because they are
something to behold.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.843
- They spared no expense.

24:05.845 --> 24:07.812
Is this a joke?

24:07.814 --> 24:10.815
No, we're still
on dial-up. Yeah.

24:10.817 --> 24:13.083
Town council actually voted
down high-speed Internet,

24:13.085 --> 24:16.020
something about
ready access to pornography.

24:16.022 --> 24:19.089
No, no. I mean,
about the money.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.658
There's-- there's nothing?

24:20.660 --> 24:22.026
No, there's not true.

24:22.028 --> 24:24.228
Uh, you, you can
live in the house

24:24.230 --> 24:26.497
for as long as
you should want to.

24:26.499 --> 24:27.698
Well, what would that be worth?

24:27.700 --> 24:30.935
It's not--
i mean, a lot, but...

24:30.937 --> 24:33.704
Again, if you should
choose to sell the house,

24:33.706 --> 24:35.005
I'd go right back
into the library.

24:35.007 --> 24:39.543
So, uh, she left
me nothing, then?

24:42.013 --> 24:43.714
Um, well,

24:43.716 --> 24:47.952
Heather actually made you
this casserole, so.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.954
There's three kinds
of cheese,

24:49.956 --> 24:53.023
and there's broccolini
in there, I think.

24:53.025 --> 24:56.560
Would you, um,
mind giving me a minute, please?

24:56.562 --> 24:58.496
-Alone.
-Yeah. Yeah.

25:02.534 --> 25:05.736
--Oh, my god.

25:05.738 --> 25:06.737
Of course.

25:10.041 --> 25:11.742
-Hello?
-Hey.

25:11.744 --> 25:13.978
I was just calling to check in,
see how you're doing.

25:13.980 --> 25:17.214
Well, you know,
I'm pretty terrible,
actually.

25:17.216 --> 25:20.618
Oh, uh, okay.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.953
I don't have your book.

25:22.955 --> 25:25.222
-Next week is fine.
-No, I mean,

25:25.224 --> 25:28.526
i-- I don't have your book,
i haven't written anything.

25:28.528 --> 25:30.561
I came back here hoping
i could use my inheritance

25:30.563 --> 25:32.630
to pay back the advance,

25:32.632 --> 25:34.865
but my mother didn't
leave me anything.

25:36.068 --> 25:37.601
Nothing.

25:39.571 --> 25:41.906
-We had plans.
-I know.

25:41.908 --> 25:44.174
All this time,
why didn't you say something?

25:44.176 --> 25:46.210
I don't know.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.980
-I fucked up.
-Look.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.549
I'm gonna make this
easy for you

25:51.551 --> 25:53.284
because you're going
through a lot right now.

25:53.286 --> 25:56.987
It doesn't have to be the book
that you originally pitched me,

25:56.989 --> 25:59.156
but it has to be something.

25:59.158 --> 26:02.560
It has to be sexy
and honest and raw.

26:02.562 --> 26:03.994
Dig deep.

26:05.830 --> 26:08.832
You have 24 hours to send me
a pitch or return the money.

26:08.834 --> 26:11.835
And if neither
of those happen?

26:11.837 --> 26:14.004
-You know any good lawyers?
-Nope,

26:14.006 --> 26:16.740
just a shitty
small-town one.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.943
And here we are.

26:22.881 --> 26:26.216
Hey, you weren't counting
on these royalties, were you?

26:26.218 --> 26:28.752
No, of course not.

26:28.754 --> 26:31.322
Yeah. Right.
Big city writer, right?

26:33.959 --> 26:36.860
It's nice to see you--
i mean,

26:36.862 --> 26:39.930
with lots of terrible
circumstances, but, uh,

26:39.932 --> 26:42.232
you never realize
how much you miss somebody,

26:42.234 --> 26:44.368
until...

26:44.370 --> 26:46.370
-Until what?
-I don't know where
i was going with that.

26:46.372 --> 26:49.073
I just, uh...

26:49.075 --> 26:52.943
You know, I just didn't like
how things ended with us,

26:52.945 --> 26:54.812
obviously.

26:54.814 --> 26:57.147
You mean like
how you ran off,
like a coward

26:57.149 --> 26:59.249
and you hid
in the bathroom?

26:59.251 --> 27:02.886
Yes, that's-- that's, uh...
That's-- yeah.

27:02.888 --> 27:05.756
You know,
technically,

27:05.758 --> 27:08.092
we never really ended things.

27:08.094 --> 27:10.260
Yeah.

27:10.262 --> 27:12.663
And we never broke up.

27:12.665 --> 27:15.232
I came back for you, Adam.

27:17.235 --> 27:20.371
Okay, I can't tell
if you're messing with me.

27:20.373 --> 27:22.206
-Can't you?
-I--

27:23.241 --> 27:25.075
hey.

27:26.277 --> 27:29.780
--What're you doing here?

27:29.782 --> 27:32.983
Well, I could ask you
the same thing, sugar pie.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.219
Just, uh,
the estate meeting today...

27:35.221 --> 27:36.987
-Of course.
-...Is what we're doing,
talking about it, yeah.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.323
What are you doing here?

27:39.325 --> 27:41.892
Well, I was hoping
we could have a little chat.

27:41.894 --> 27:42.926
Just us girls.

27:47.132 --> 27:49.767
So...
You and Adam.

27:49.769 --> 27:52.970
Oh, absolutely.

27:52.972 --> 27:54.705
It's funny.

27:54.707 --> 27:57.808
I just never really
pictured you two together.

27:57.810 --> 28:01.412
You know, he will make
a wonderful father.

28:03.815 --> 28:06.316
Well, sounds like you have
your future all mapped out.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.952
That's--
that's really nice.

28:08.954 --> 28:11.955
So, funny thing,

28:11.957 --> 28:15.092
I was re-reading
that one article of yours.

28:15.094 --> 28:16.960
Some very witty

28:16.962 --> 28:19.463
and wonderful turns of phrase,
by the way,

28:19.465 --> 28:22.066
-no wonder
it caught a virus.
-Went viral?

28:22.068 --> 28:24.935
And I was thinking,
you may be right
about a few things.

28:24.937 --> 28:27.471
Perhaps we are a little bit
sexually repressed.

28:27.473 --> 28:30.174
At any rate,
i was thinking,

28:30.176 --> 28:31.875
you know we probably
could use

28:31.877 --> 28:34.178
a little shake up
here in beaver's Ridge,

28:34.180 --> 28:37.748
and I think your orgy idea
is just the ticket.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.117
What-- hang on,
my orgy-what-now?

28:40.119 --> 28:43.487
I'll organize,
and you can instruct.

28:43.489 --> 28:46.023
-Uh, no.
-At least think about it.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.891
It's really
the least you could do.

28:47.893 --> 28:51.428
Actually,
the least I can do
is nothing.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.831
Well, now who's being
the small-minded one?

28:53.833 --> 28:57.134
You know, I thought
you would jump at the chance
to watch all of us

28:57.136 --> 28:58.869
make fools of ourselves

28:58.871 --> 29:01.905
as we delve into
the perversions of your mind.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.774
You know,
probably give you fodder

29:03.776 --> 29:05.776
for a whole new series
of articles,

29:05.778 --> 29:07.277
"how to plan an orgy
in a small town."

29:07.279 --> 29:10.948
I mean, if you can come up
with a better title.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.083
Unless, of course,
you can't handle it.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.489
So, all I would have to do
is instruct?

29:20.191 --> 29:21.825
I mean, like,
i wouldn't actually have to...

29:21.827 --> 29:24.128
Fornicate with us?
Oh, god. No.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.035
Heather wants me to plan
a sex party.

29:34.039 --> 29:36.507
Oh, that's fucking hilarious.

29:36.509 --> 29:40.210
Mmm.
But, what's wrong?

29:41.546 --> 29:44.381
- I'm a virgin.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.021
So, just to clarify

29:51.023 --> 29:54.324
everything you know about sex
is bullshit?

29:54.326 --> 29:56.860
No, that-- that's--
that's not true.

29:56.862 --> 29:59.363
I've-- I've interviewed people,

29:59.365 --> 30:01.165
and I go to bars, and...

30:01.167 --> 30:05.202
I belong to a few sex clubs.
It's just no applied knowledge.

30:09.274 --> 30:11.909
Wait. Did your father
molest you?

30:11.911 --> 30:14.812
-Alice, Jesus Christ.
-Okay.

30:14.814 --> 30:16.280
Well, I'm sorry.

30:16.282 --> 30:18.448
I just have to ask
'cause that happens to people.

30:18.450 --> 30:21.418
And then they get
all psychologically mashed up,
and then they--

30:21.420 --> 30:23.253
like their vagina's
sealed shut,

30:23.255 --> 30:26.590
-so they can't even have sex.
-Okay, well, it's not that.

30:26.592 --> 30:30.527
- 'Cause you're terrified of sex?
- -No.

30:30.529 --> 30:35.399
I'm just waiting for someone
i can trust.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.935
I need a new drink
'cause I just threw up
in that one.

30:37.937 --> 30:39.570
Okay, fuck off.

30:41.206 --> 30:43.473
Will you come with me
to this thing, or not?

30:43.475 --> 30:45.209
Sweetie,

30:45.211 --> 30:48.212
you're my very best friend
in this whole stupid town.

30:48.214 --> 30:50.280
I will totally
come to your orgy,

30:50.282 --> 30:52.616
and I will totally
be there for you,

30:52.618 --> 30:56.220
and I will totally bang
all the hot guys that show up.

31:01.460 --> 31:04.027
That was fast.
What's the verdict?

31:04.029 --> 31:06.029
I'm digging deep.

31:24.182 --> 31:25.282
Ow!

31:38.329 --> 31:41.331
- You ready?

31:41.333 --> 31:42.933
I-- I don't know.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.601
I feel like
I'm gonna throw up.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.503
I mean-- I mean,
can we do this?

31:46.505 --> 31:48.238
Is this us?

31:48.240 --> 31:51.041
Are we--
are we orgy people?

31:51.043 --> 31:52.943
What we're not
is quitters.

31:52.945 --> 31:55.946
Now, if we don't go downstairs
and open that door,

31:55.948 --> 31:58.415
then everything
that Cassie cranston
thinks about us

31:58.417 --> 31:59.950
and beaver's Ridge,
will be true.

31:59.952 --> 32:02.286
She'll think
that we're cowards.

32:02.288 --> 32:04.087
Is that what you want her
to think about you?

32:06.224 --> 32:10.093
So, I know all of you
are sexually active,

32:10.095 --> 32:11.595
but what you
are about to embark on

32:11.597 --> 32:14.131
needs to be
treated and seen

32:14.133 --> 32:17.067
with the respect
of a sport.

32:17.069 --> 32:18.235
Okay?

32:18.237 --> 32:19.636
There will be surprises.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.138
The odd queef.

32:21.140 --> 32:24.241
Yeah, okay, yeah.
What is a "queef"?

32:24.243 --> 32:25.976
Oh, um,

32:25.978 --> 32:30.213
okay, it's like flatulence,
that comes out of your--

32:30.215 --> 32:31.982
--mm-hmm.

32:31.984 --> 32:36.153
Basically, you're hammering
large quantities of air

32:36.155 --> 32:38.422
into a tight, moist, space,

32:38.424 --> 32:40.057
so, sounds
are gonna be made.

32:40.059 --> 32:42.159
Next, um, stamina.

32:42.161 --> 32:46.396
It's gonna go
a lot faster than you think.
Pornography lies.

32:46.398 --> 32:48.565
No man can go properly
for 40 minutes

32:48.567 --> 32:50.567
without having an aneurism,
and at that point,

32:50.569 --> 32:52.736
any woman's vagina
is gonna be squealing

32:52.738 --> 32:54.271
like a worn-out brake pad

32:54.273 --> 32:57.441
at the end
of a high-speed chase.

32:57.443 --> 33:00.344
Are these colorful phrases
really necessary?

33:00.346 --> 33:02.379
Well, we need to know
what to expect.

33:02.381 --> 33:05.215
You need to stay hydrated.
You're gonna sweat.

33:05.217 --> 33:08.285
Which brings me
to my next topic.

33:08.287 --> 33:11.188
Sex stank.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.156
You're not gonna
notice your own.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.192
But you will notice
other peoples,

33:15.194 --> 33:17.427
and in a room full
of people sweating,

33:17.429 --> 33:21.031
and mashing their
genitals together,

33:21.033 --> 33:22.232
it's--
it's gonna create a--

33:22.234 --> 33:24.267
musk.

33:24.269 --> 33:27.004
How bad could it
possibly be?

33:27.006 --> 33:29.039
Oh, bad.
Thick.

33:29.041 --> 33:31.541
It's gonna seep
into everything.

33:31.543 --> 33:35.145
Thank god I got these lovely
plastic couch covers.

33:36.547 --> 33:38.382
-So, shall we just dive
right in?
-Mm-hmm.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.317
-Well.
-Mm-hmm.

33:40.319 --> 33:44.054
I think this
was supposed to just be
a preliminary chat.

33:44.056 --> 33:47.157
Did anyone here
think we were just gonna
dive right in?

33:47.159 --> 33:50.494
Oh, okay. Wow.

34:21.693 --> 34:23.360
Okay, uh, guys,

34:23.362 --> 34:25.228
i-- I think--
think if you're
gonna do this,

34:25.230 --> 34:27.297
you just have to rip
the band-aid off,

34:27.299 --> 34:30.567
and, and... do it.
You know?

34:30.569 --> 34:32.069
Yeah.

34:32.071 --> 34:34.071
Heather,
do you have an egg timer?

34:34.072 --> 34:36.306
-Yes, I do. Yeah.
-That way, we can set the timer

34:36.308 --> 34:37.808
for five minutes
and give everybody

34:37.810 --> 34:41.344
a chance to switch it up,
if they want to.

34:41.346 --> 34:43.647
Um, I...

34:45.449 --> 34:48.518
All right,
we're gonna kick it
old-school.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.719
Gentlemen,
put your keys in the bowl.

34:50.722 --> 34:53.590
Yeah. Oh, I walked here,
can I use fishing license?

34:53.592 --> 34:55.458
--How do you not have keys?

34:55.460 --> 34:57.561
Who locks their door?

35:02.233 --> 35:05.235
So, my choices are Adam,
or Bruce.

35:05.237 --> 35:07.571
Uh, can't have sex with Adam.
He's your husband.

35:07.573 --> 35:10.540
Right, I mean,
why would you want
to sleep with me?

35:10.542 --> 35:12.876
- You're right.
- -I was kidding.

35:12.878 --> 35:15.745
Okay, Bruce.
Let's make the best of it.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.347
A little less enthusiasm,
please.

35:26.257 --> 35:27.757
How are we not
already having sex?

35:27.759 --> 35:29.626
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, i-- I just,

35:29.628 --> 35:31.294
you're just-- you--
you're really beautiful.

35:31.296 --> 35:32.762
I'm sorry.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.297
It's okay.
You know what I'm gonna do?

35:34.299 --> 35:35.765
I'm gonna close my eyes,

35:35.767 --> 35:37.334
and I'm just gonna imagine
that you have leprosy.

35:37.336 --> 35:39.336
And then, otherwise,
this is gonna--

35:40.672 --> 35:42.672
- and that's not...

35:42.674 --> 35:44.641
You shouldn't
tell people that.

35:53.718 --> 35:55.719
No-- okay, uh,
just give me a second.

35:55.721 --> 35:57.420
Give me a second.

35:57.422 --> 36:00.757
Okay-- okay, I'm good now.
I'm good.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.859
Nope. Nope.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.195
--That's my jawbone.

36:05.197 --> 36:07.330
-Yeah.
-Oh, so defiant.

36:07.332 --> 36:10.367
Slow it down,
slow it way down.

36:10.369 --> 36:12.235
Slow it way down.

36:12.237 --> 36:15.505
--Uh... okay...

36:17.375 --> 36:19.876
Oh, my god,
your lips.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.779
-My lips?
-They're so soft.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.648
What do you put
on them?

36:24.650 --> 36:28.552
Uh, well, wine.
Wine, mostly.

36:28.554 --> 36:30.420
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait--

36:30.422 --> 36:32.289
wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no, no.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.291
- No, no, no, I can't.

36:34.293 --> 36:36.193
No, no, no, no,
just hold it.
Hold on.

36:37.963 --> 36:39.963
Stop staring,
it's rude.

36:39.965 --> 36:42.532
Where am I supposed to look?

36:42.534 --> 36:45.802
-Is this turning you on?
-It's not--

36:45.804 --> 36:47.470
not turning me on.

36:50.341 --> 36:53.877
Three, two, wa-- wait.
No, I need-- I need six...

36:53.879 --> 36:55.478
-No, that's it.
-Uh!

36:57.382 --> 36:58.748
Oh, come on. Come on,
i was just getting
my groove on.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.984
-Time's up. Chester?
-Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.

37:00.986 --> 37:03.687
Excuse me, I'm--
I'm gonna need a few minutes,
to, uh, pardon me.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.522
Replenish the fluids here
'cause...

37:05.524 --> 37:07.958
-Whoa, did you already?
-I just grazed the tip.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.793
-I grazed it.
-Please. Please tell me

37:09.795 --> 37:11.795
-it was on the couch cover.
-I'm ready to party.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.330
-Jeez.
-Is that normal?

37:13.332 --> 37:14.998
God no.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.766
-Hey, why don't we
have some make-up sex?
-Oh, no.

37:16.768 --> 37:19.369
Did not all the energy in here
just get sucked out?

37:19.371 --> 37:21.771
-No, no, it didn't. Ow.
-Um, I think we--

37:21.773 --> 37:23.907
we ripped the band-aid off
a little too quickly here.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.609
We should have catered.

37:25.611 --> 37:27.711
A potluck
would have been nice.

37:27.713 --> 37:30.347
Cassie, I feel like we're
gonna need some spare dicks,

37:30.349 --> 37:32.682
incase,
you know, chappy gets
pre-maturely excited,

37:32.684 --> 37:34.517
-just keep the party going.
-I can hear you.

37:34.519 --> 37:35.919
-Agreed.
-You know what would be good?

37:35.921 --> 37:37.621
Is maybe if we had
some other ladies as well?

37:37.623 --> 37:39.823
-Yeah.
-People from around town.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.358
Or Cassie,
if you wanted get involved.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.859
Uh, no.

37:42.861 --> 37:44.561
I-- I mean, i-- I,
that wasn't--

37:44.563 --> 37:46.496
that wasn't part
of the-- no.

37:46.498 --> 37:49.332
Um, okay, I think
this little experiment
has just proven

37:49.334 --> 37:51.468
that we need to go
a little bit slower.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.871
So, let's get together again,

37:54.873 --> 37:58.408
but this time, ease into it,
focus on the basics.

37:58.410 --> 38:01.745
And if all goes well,
then, round two.

38:01.747 --> 38:03.446
Look, I don't want to sound like
a jerk here, okay?

38:03.448 --> 38:05.482
But what am I supposed to do
with this erection?

38:05.484 --> 38:07.350
-I mean...
-Yeah, I saw a papaya
on the counter there

38:07.352 --> 38:08.752
you could probably
have your way with.

38:08.754 --> 38:11.655
No, it's too ripe.
It's not gonna work.

38:11.657 --> 38:12.989
Why do you know that?

38:18.863 --> 38:20.563
What about Michael lobucks?

38:20.565 --> 38:21.798
He's got a terrible
back issue.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.433
He wouldn't the last
five minutes.

38:23.435 --> 38:26.870
-What about the mayor?
-Gus, Gus? Been there.

38:28.939 --> 38:31.541
-They can't be black.
-Oh, my god.

38:33.010 --> 38:35.478
Wait, Gus is black?

38:35.480 --> 38:37.580
-Mrs. reddick.
-Bruce, she's dead.

38:37.582 --> 38:40.684
Margo and Dave Anderson.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.452
No-- no. Absolutely not.

38:42.454 --> 38:44.354
Have you seen
how he plays charades?

38:44.356 --> 38:46.089
I'm not getting
into a sexual situation
with that man.

38:46.091 --> 38:48.091
So, there's a bunch of us
and we're doing this thing,

38:48.093 --> 38:50.093
-okay?
-Yeah.

38:50.095 --> 38:51.961
And, I don't know
how to ask...

38:51.963 --> 38:54.964
We've been encouraged to invite
other people to the thing.

38:54.966 --> 38:56.833
-Right.
-What we're gonna be doing is...

38:56.835 --> 38:59.369
-What kind of thing is it?
-We're gonna-- it's a,

38:59.371 --> 39:01.705
it's like a pri--
it's like a very...

39:01.707 --> 39:03.707
-It's a private fun thing.
-Yeah.

39:03.709 --> 39:06.710
-Yeah.
-Like, we're all--
we are all together...

39:06.712 --> 39:08.712
-In the private thing...
-Yeah.

39:08.714 --> 39:11.981
...where you
touch each other's nipples
and you fuck each other?

39:11.983 --> 39:14.351
-How do you know--
what are you--
-stop trying to invite me

39:16.688 --> 39:19.689
how do I not
know about the orgy?
Bruce is all over town.

39:19.691 --> 39:22.025
And you need to talk to that guy
because everybody in this town

39:22.027 --> 39:24.027
is gonna know
what you idiots are up to.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.896
Okay, okay, okay.
So he did Bruce invite
you to it, already?

39:26.898 --> 39:28.598
-Yes, he did.
-He did, eh?

39:28.600 --> 39:30.100
Yes.

39:30.102 --> 39:33.069
-So you...
-No. No!

39:33.071 --> 39:35.071
I knew you were
gonna ask me that.

39:35.073 --> 39:37.607
-You disappoint me, Chester.
-What?

39:37.609 --> 39:39.909
You guys haven't rsvp'ed
to my party, yet.

39:39.911 --> 39:42.846
Wow, hey. Seth, man.
How long have you been
standing there?

39:42.848 --> 39:46.015
Actually, funny
that you're here,

39:46.017 --> 39:48.017
because Chester has something
that he wants to ask you.

39:48.019 --> 39:50.019
- No--
-there's this thing
that's happening.

39:50.021 --> 39:51.821
And, people are encouraged...

39:51.823 --> 39:54.424
-No, that's not--
-to invite other people...

39:54.426 --> 39:57.727
And he wanted to talk to you
about this thing.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.062
No. What? Coming.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.864
I gotta grab this--
this, delivery.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.732
-Oh, really?
-I gotta get
this delivery here.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.534
- Interesting.
- -Isn't that your bathroom?

40:04.536 --> 40:05.735
-What?
-Are you going
to the bathroom?

40:05.737 --> 40:07.704
-Hey, Seth.
-Hi, pauline.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.039
How is your day going,
buddy?

40:10.041 --> 40:12.509
-It's busy.
-Yeah.

40:15.513 --> 40:17.847
So, you want to have
an orgy in a town

40:17.849 --> 40:20.016
where you can dial
the wrong number,

40:20.018 --> 40:22.018
and still have a
ten-minute conversation?

40:22.020 --> 40:24.421
I'll owe you.

40:24.423 --> 40:26.055
I really need to work
the numbers in my favor,

40:26.057 --> 40:28.758
and you coming helps knock
some of the other guys out.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.794
-How?
-You know...

40:32.730 --> 40:34.998
You smoke a pole man,
you know.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
-The pole?
-Yeah, you play the skin flute,

40:37.002 --> 40:38.768
you put penises in your mouth,
'cause you're gay.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.837
Not 'cause you're happy,
'cause you're a homosexual.

40:40.839 --> 40:42.205
Not that you couldn't be
a homosexual and be happy

40:42.207 --> 40:44.808
I'm sure you love it.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.843
So...

40:46.845 --> 40:49.979
You want me at this orgy
because I'm gay,

40:49.981 --> 40:53.850
and that will force
one of the other non-gay
men to sleep with me,

40:53.852 --> 40:56.920
which will make more women
available for you?

40:56.922 --> 40:58.855
Look.

40:58.857 --> 41:01.691
I really need this, man.

41:01.693 --> 41:03.460
Allie's leaving me,
it was--

41:03.462 --> 41:05.462
it was a huge hit to my ego.

41:06.764 --> 41:08.765
If I agree to this,

41:08.767 --> 41:10.800
you give me
the full commission
on your house.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.969
That's a big commission, man.

41:12.971 --> 41:15.572
-Are you coming to
my birthday party?
-Jesus Christ.

41:15.574 --> 41:17.841
My mom wanted an rsvp
like, yesterday.

41:17.843 --> 41:20.810
I don't know, man.

41:20.812 --> 41:24.047
You should totally
come to our party, Seth.

41:27.952 --> 41:30.019
I...

41:34.859 --> 41:37.827
-Alice.
-Fuck! Jesus, Seth.

41:37.829 --> 41:40.029
You haven't rsvp'ed
to my party, yet.

41:40.031 --> 41:42.899
-Haven't I?
-It's just my mom.

41:42.901 --> 41:45.802
She doesn't know
how many cupcakes to make.
She's freaking out.

41:45.804 --> 41:47.904
Mm. Okay.

41:47.906 --> 41:49.939
Are you going to that party?

41:49.941 --> 41:52.008
-What party?
-I don't know.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.878
Bruce told me
about some party
at Adam's.

41:54.880 --> 41:56.212
-That's been cancelled.
-Are you sure?

41:56.214 --> 41:58.748
Because he just told me
about it like, just now.

41:58.750 --> 42:00.183
Well, Seth,

42:00.185 --> 42:02.085
I don't know,
because Bruce is an idiot.

42:02.087 --> 42:03.586
Yeah.

42:03.588 --> 42:04.921
Hey, um, that's good,

42:04.923 --> 42:06.923
because tomorrow's
my party anyways,

42:06.925 --> 42:08.691
so you can just tell
everybody to rsvp,

42:08.693 --> 42:10.026
and then they can come.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.529
Okay, I, uh,

42:12.531 --> 42:13.863
I'll try to remember.

42:13.865 --> 42:15.832
-Can I have a glass of water?
-I don't.

42:15.834 --> 42:17.700
-I don't have any water.
-I'm thirsty.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.636
-Okay.
-Do you have a blanket?
I'm cold.

42:24.842 --> 42:26.843
So, I think the first thing
we need to do here

42:26.845 --> 42:28.711
is-- is just

42:28.713 --> 42:31.781
acknowledge the awkwardness
of the situation.

42:31.783 --> 42:35.785
So, Chester,
if maybe we could--
switch spots.

42:35.787 --> 42:37.120
So you could sit over here.

42:37.122 --> 42:38.855
-You wanna do a--
-yeah.

42:38.857 --> 42:40.290
Okay.

42:42.326 --> 42:45.061
-So, let's start with Heather.
-Hmm.

42:45.063 --> 42:46.296
How does it make you feel

42:46.298 --> 42:49.132
to see Adam
with someone else?

42:51.335 --> 42:54.170
Oh, well-- well, I...

42:55.706 --> 42:57.707
I think we can all
be adults here.

42:57.709 --> 42:58.875
Yeah?

42:58.877 --> 43:01.744
Okay, so,
this doesn't bother you,

43:01.746 --> 43:04.714
or make you upset
or uncomfortable at all?

43:06.750 --> 43:09.619
Mm-mm. No.

43:09.621 --> 43:11.621
No, I think that's, um,

43:11.623 --> 43:12.956
that's very neighborly of you,

43:12.958 --> 43:14.958
of-- of both of you.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.126
I'm very neighborly.

43:17.128 --> 43:20.763
-Is this--
is this hard for you, Adam?
-Oh, it's hard for me.

43:20.765 --> 43:23.099
I mean, this--
it would-- this--

43:23.101 --> 43:25.668
that would be hard for me.
That would be challenging.

43:25.670 --> 43:28.838
Yeah, what about this,
Heather? Huh?

43:28.840 --> 43:34.077
This must be driving you
absolutely insane.

43:34.079 --> 43:35.778
Bruce, what are you doing?

43:35.780 --> 43:38.348
Oh, we're just easing
into it, big fella.

43:38.350 --> 43:40.183
You know,
you are carrying

43:40.185 --> 43:43.653
-a lot of tension...
-Mm-hmm.

43:43.655 --> 43:45.989
...in your buster deltoids.
Can you feel that?

43:45.991 --> 43:47.991
You know what?
I'd be a lot easier if I got
your shirt off.

43:47.993 --> 43:49.325
-That way we can
really get at it.
-Um, I don't think...

43:49.327 --> 43:51.327
--I'll get it.

43:51.329 --> 43:53.329
-Ttat'll be our
additional guests.
-Oh.

43:53.331 --> 43:54.864
Yeah, okay,
let's just go ahead.

43:54.866 --> 43:56.366
That's a weird way
to open a shirt, anyway.

43:56.368 --> 43:58.101
Let's just-- let's just put
the kybosh on that,

43:58.103 --> 43:59.802
-and see who
these guests are.
-Go away!

43:59.804 --> 44:01.270
Jesus fucking...

44:02.806 --> 44:05.675
Hi, guys.
Hey, come on in.

44:05.677 --> 44:07.877
-Thank you.
-Everybody,

44:07.879 --> 44:11.381
you remember Anna
and Otis.

44:11.383 --> 44:13.249
- From racquetball, right?
- -Hi.

44:13.251 --> 44:15.385
Who the fuck invited you?

44:16.920 --> 44:18.421
Honey, I don't
know about this.

44:18.423 --> 44:20.957
Um, just a moment,
everyone.

44:20.959 --> 44:23.326
Sure.

44:23.328 --> 44:26.329
Sweetie, we agreed to this.

44:26.331 --> 44:29.032
Everything we tried
hasn't been working.

44:29.034 --> 44:31.868
The long walks, the spicy food,
the primrose oil.

44:31.870 --> 44:33.870
I mean, the mid-wife
thought that maybe this
would do the trick.

44:33.872 --> 44:35.672
-I know.
-We want to do it naturally.

44:35.674 --> 44:39.008
I know, I know,
but why can't it just be you?

44:39.010 --> 44:42.445
Because it's been me
for the last 48 hours
and I'm exhausted.

44:45.182 --> 44:47.684
--Listen, you--

44:47.686 --> 44:50.787
you're peeing every ten minutes,
you're not sleeping.

44:50.789 --> 44:54.924
I love you so much,
but this baby needs
to come out.

44:56.861 --> 44:58.227
-You're right.
-Yeah.

44:59.464 --> 45:01.764
-We need to do this.
-Right.

45:01.766 --> 45:03.866
I love you.

45:03.868 --> 45:06.202
-Okay.
-Are we ready?

45:06.204 --> 45:07.837
Yeah, I'm ready.

45:09.440 --> 45:14.343
Okay, so,
who's gonna fuck
my wife first?

45:17.481 --> 45:19.182
Okay, uh, sexual positions...

45:19.184 --> 45:20.717
Oh, uh, I know
all three of them,

45:20.719 --> 45:22.819
but we only do
the doggy-style.

45:22.821 --> 45:24.854
-I'm sorry,
all three of them?
-Mm-hmm.

45:24.856 --> 45:26.856
You guys don't look
at each other when you--

45:26.858 --> 45:28.157
-nope.
-Mm-mm.

45:28.159 --> 45:30.193
Why not?

45:30.195 --> 45:32.028
You know, I don't think
anyone wants to know that.

45:32.030 --> 45:33.262
-I wanna know.
-I'd love to know.

45:33.264 --> 45:34.797
It's private,
it's between us.

45:34.799 --> 45:36.365
-He makes a face.
-Okay.

45:36.367 --> 45:37.734
-It's very unpleasant.
-It's involuntary.

45:37.736 --> 45:39.769
It's disturbing,
actually.

45:39.771 --> 45:42.105
It's like a sneeze.
Would you judge a person
for how they sneeze?

45:42.107 --> 45:45.842
Oh-- okay,
let's not ruin the surprise.

45:45.844 --> 45:50.146
Um.
We have some work to do.
Everybody grab a partner.

45:50.148 --> 45:51.848
Okay, I drew up some
sexual positions

45:51.850 --> 45:53.416
for us to try here.

45:53.418 --> 45:55.384
-What, really? Me?
-Get lost.

45:55.386 --> 45:57.086
Thank you.
I would-- I would be honored.

45:57.088 --> 45:59.255
If we could just
skip the lego instructions.

45:59.257 --> 46:01.257
I mean, clearly,
I've done this before.

46:01.259 --> 46:03.960
I really just need someone
to bang the baby out of me.

46:03.962 --> 46:07.296
Uh, also, if you could
ejaculate directly inside

46:07.298 --> 46:09.499
my wife's vagina,
that would be great.

46:09.501 --> 46:11.868
Uh, it actually contains
prosteligence

46:11.870 --> 46:16.005
which can stimulate the cervix
and can cause contractions.

46:16.007 --> 46:17.874
Yeah.

46:20.144 --> 46:22.311
Can you not put all
your weight on me?

46:22.313 --> 46:26.315
-It makes me feel like
i gotta pee.
-You wanna pee on me?

46:26.317 --> 46:28.484
That is not even close
to what I said.

46:28.486 --> 46:32.488
Okay, Bruce, why don't
you try putting her leg
over your shoulder?

46:32.490 --> 46:35.024
-Oh, oh, ooh.
-Yeah, yeah.

46:35.026 --> 46:36.526
It actually feels,
it does feel good.

46:36.528 --> 46:38.461
Honey, why have we never
tried this position?

46:38.463 --> 46:41.430
-I didn't know you liked that.
-Well, you could have asked.

46:41.432 --> 46:45.034
-I'm not a mind-reader, pumpkin.
-That's why you should ask.

46:45.036 --> 46:48.104
Okay, i-- I don't think
this is the time for that, guys.

46:48.106 --> 46:49.806
Right. Sorry, honey.
We're being rude.

46:49.808 --> 46:51.874
Bruce is trying
to penetrate me.

46:51.876 --> 46:55.044
I'm sorry, Bruce.
All right, give me what you got.

46:55.046 --> 46:58.114
-I got nothing, ow.
This is--
-what?

46:58.116 --> 47:00.583
-This is fucked up, man.
-What?

47:00.585 --> 47:04.153
What the fuck
is your problem?

47:04.155 --> 47:06.155
Two, three, okay.
I gotta get it right...

47:06.157 --> 47:09.292
-Yep, yep, okay.
-...In here.

47:09.294 --> 47:11.828
-Uh-huh.
-Cassie?

47:11.830 --> 47:14.163
I don't know,
i think one of us has to be
lesbian to do this.

47:14.165 --> 47:16.032
Well, no, not if--
see here,

47:16.034 --> 47:17.500
if you're more like this...

47:17.502 --> 47:19.035
-Then...
-Oh, I see.

47:19.037 --> 47:21.370
Yeah, no,
we both have to be lesbian.

47:21.372 --> 47:23.206
- Oh!
-So that's not gonna work.

47:25.309 --> 47:27.476
Oh.

47:27.478 --> 47:31.180
There's no need
to be shy, Otis.

47:31.182 --> 47:34.584
I for one am very interested
in fornicating with you.

47:34.586 --> 47:37.119
Oh.
Well, uh, no, no, no.

47:37.121 --> 47:40.289
Uh, I'm just here for Anna,
incase the baby pops.

47:40.291 --> 47:43.292
Surely there's better ways
to pass the time.

47:43.294 --> 47:47.163
Oh, well,
I'm gonna say thank you,
but no thank you.

47:47.165 --> 47:49.332
Okay, I'm gonna level
with you here,

47:49.334 --> 47:51.334
Anna told me
that you got her pregnant
without even trying.

47:51.336 --> 47:53.536
I need your baby batter,
so be a neighbor.

47:53.538 --> 47:56.639
Well, I mean, my--
my semen isn't sugar, Heather.

47:56.641 --> 47:59.175
Besides, Anna and i
have been having sex
all day, all right?

47:59.177 --> 48:00.509
I'm exhausted.

48:00.511 --> 48:02.044
Even if I could get it up,

48:02.046 --> 48:04.647
it's like a ghost
coughing down there.

48:08.986 --> 48:11.320
-Oh, my god.
-Did you just...?

48:11.322 --> 48:12.889
No, no. I'm good.

48:12.891 --> 48:15.224
Uh...

48:15.226 --> 48:17.560
Okay, I think we can...

48:17.562 --> 48:19.562
Start with the actual sex now.

48:19.564 --> 48:21.097
-I'm...
-Yeah?

48:21.099 --> 48:22.431
-Yeah, I think I'm ready.
-Okay.

48:22.433 --> 48:24.433
-Yeah.
-Whoa, hey, uh, i--

48:24.435 --> 48:27.436
-i felt the baby kick.
-Well, don't make it weird.

48:27.438 --> 48:29.305
She just wants to say hello.

48:29.307 --> 48:31.007
-Don't you baby?
-Please don't talk
like a baby.

48:31.009 --> 48:32.909
She just wants
to meet everybody.

48:32.911 --> 48:35.244
Help her meet
everybody, Adam.

48:35.246 --> 48:36.946
I don't know
that I'm qualified for that.

48:36.948 --> 48:39.282
Shh-shh.
Keep it sexy, okay?

48:39.284 --> 48:41.684
Uh, if you--
if you arch your back,

48:41.686 --> 48:45.054
I think it'll allow
for at least another
inch of penetration.

48:45.056 --> 48:47.390
-Oh.
-Thank you, Cassie.

48:49.928 --> 48:51.427
Oh, my god.
Oh, jeez.

48:51.429 --> 48:54.397
Um, just for the record,
i am not inside you right now.

48:57.135 --> 48:58.634
-It's...
-Is this a good position?

48:58.636 --> 49:01.203
It's just the water stage.

49:01.205 --> 49:02.571
The baby's not
gonna come for hours.

49:02.573 --> 49:04.140
Water stage?

49:07.511 --> 49:10.513
Ooh, ah.

49:10.515 --> 49:12.048
Are-- are you--
are you having a seizure?

49:12.050 --> 49:13.716
- What's...
- -It's coming!

49:13.718 --> 49:16.218
Oh, my god. Are you having
a contraction?

49:16.220 --> 49:18.554
Oh, there it is!

49:18.556 --> 49:20.089
-Okay, it's happening.
-It's fine, it's fine.

49:20.091 --> 49:21.390
-It's happening?
-It's happening.

49:21.392 --> 49:23.526
-We got a while yet.
-No, no, no.

49:23.528 --> 49:25.962
If we could get it
wrapped up as soon as possible.
If that's possible.

49:25.964 --> 49:27.997
-Let's get her up.
-This feels so fucking good.

49:27.999 --> 49:30.032
Why don't you ever
feel this fucking good?

49:30.034 --> 49:32.535
She doesn't mean that, guys.
That's the baby talking.

49:32.537 --> 49:35.071
Uh, can we get this guy off?
This is my wife, here.

49:35.073 --> 49:37.506
Just a little bit of help guys,
would be really...

49:41.045 --> 49:42.311
- Screamer.

49:42.313 --> 49:43.546
Okay, there it is.

49:43.548 --> 49:45.548
-There we go.
-Never throw those out.

49:45.550 --> 49:47.650
Uh, thank you so much, guys,
thank you so much.

49:47.652 --> 49:50.086
See, what did I tell you
about the plastic couch covers?

49:50.088 --> 49:51.587
What a great night guys.
Thank you.

49:55.726 --> 49:57.660
Can I ask a silly question?

50:00.130 --> 50:02.465
How come none of you
have realized

50:02.467 --> 50:03.766
what a terrible idea
this is?

50:03.768 --> 50:06.268
Hmm?

50:06.270 --> 50:11.140
I mean, for one night
of awkward pleasure,

50:11.142 --> 50:14.210
you are gonna jeopardize
friendships,

50:14.212 --> 50:17.780
marriages even...

50:17.782 --> 50:22.051
Look around,
these are your neighbors,
your friends,

50:22.053 --> 50:25.554
I just want to make sure
that you've thought about this.

50:25.556 --> 50:27.757
Really thought about it.

50:27.759 --> 50:31.093
This is a small town.
People are gonna find out.

50:31.095 --> 50:33.429
One of you will talk,
maybe not right away,

50:33.431 --> 50:36.098
but eventually.

50:36.100 --> 50:38.601
I read Cassie's article,

50:38.603 --> 50:41.303
and the reason why
it upset at everybody
is 'cause she's right.

50:41.305 --> 50:43.439
You are not
the type of people

50:43.441 --> 50:45.441
to do this sort of thing.

50:47.144 --> 50:48.577
You're not adventurous.

50:50.480 --> 50:52.648
Who are you trying to fool?

51:09.533 --> 51:12.735
Half a dozen chimps
are locked in a room.

51:12.737 --> 51:14.637
And in the center
of the room,

51:14.639 --> 51:17.606
there's a ladder
on top of which

51:17.608 --> 51:20.076
a banana dangles
from the ceiling.

51:20.078 --> 51:22.711
So one the chimps decides
to go for the banana.

51:22.713 --> 51:25.614
But before he can even
touch the ladder,

51:25.616 --> 51:29.085
they're all sprayed
with ice cold water.

51:29.087 --> 51:32.188
-I'm so confused right now.
-Shut up.

51:32.190 --> 51:34.690
So, after a while,
they figure out the connection,

51:34.692 --> 51:36.358
between the ladder
and the water,

51:36.360 --> 51:39.261
and they don't go
for the banana anymore.

51:40.864 --> 51:45.434
So then one of the chimps
is replaced by a new chimp.

51:45.436 --> 51:48.704
And he decides
to go for the banana.

51:48.706 --> 51:50.306
Before he can even
touch the ladder,

51:50.308 --> 51:53.309
they-- they attack him.

51:53.311 --> 51:55.644
He goes for it again
and they literally,

51:55.646 --> 51:58.814
they beat the message
into him,

51:58.816 --> 52:01.250
do not touch
the fucking ladder.

52:04.287 --> 52:07.690
Eventually,
all the chimps are replaced
by an entirely new group.

52:09.226 --> 52:10.693
They don't know
about the water.

52:10.695 --> 52:13.529
They-- they don't even know
it exists,

52:13.531 --> 52:18.267
but anytime any of them
go for that banana,

52:18.269 --> 52:20.603
they attack them.

52:20.605 --> 52:23.839
And they have no idea why.

52:23.841 --> 52:25.841
All they know is,

52:25.843 --> 52:28.911
this is what happens
when you go after

52:28.913 --> 52:31.347
the thing
you want the most.

52:32.916 --> 52:37.786
Something
someone else says
you can't have

52:37.788 --> 52:39.688
and they
never question it,

52:39.690 --> 52:41.824
it's just what they do.

52:41.826 --> 52:43.826
So my question is,

52:43.828 --> 52:48.164
are you gonna go
after your banana?

52:48.166 --> 52:51.567
Or are you gonna let
all the other chimps
knock you down?

52:53.336 --> 52:55.404
Did that make anyone else
a little bit hard?

52:55.406 --> 52:57.840
Bruce, there are ladies present.

52:57.842 --> 53:01.477
I'm sorry, did it make
anyone hard, or wet?

53:01.479 --> 53:03.379
Look, y'all want this.

53:05.849 --> 53:07.349
You need this.

53:10.453 --> 53:13.255
And if you're in,
then I'm in, too.

53:14.558 --> 53:15.925
All the way.

53:20.664 --> 53:24.266
-I'd like to go
after my banana.
-Me, too.

53:24.268 --> 53:26.302
Can I put the whole thing
in my mouth?

53:27.337 --> 53:30.906
Saturday.
My place.

53:43.954 --> 53:45.788
Maybe they're late.

53:49.859 --> 53:53.395
Why don't you
come on the cruise
with me?

53:53.397 --> 53:55.664
It'd be good for you
to get out of town.

53:55.666 --> 53:58.801
You don't need
these people.

53:58.803 --> 54:00.903
They've never accepted you.

54:19.356 --> 54:21.357
Well.

54:21.359 --> 54:23.325
Well, happy birthday, Seth.

54:34.638 --> 54:35.771
Okay.

54:39.043 --> 54:42.711
Okay.

54:42.713 --> 54:46.348
Okay. Pace yourself,
Chester, buddy.

54:46.350 --> 54:47.850
Pace.

54:47.852 --> 54:50.052
Hello.
You're very pretty.

54:50.054 --> 54:51.720
I'm Chester.

54:51.722 --> 54:54.890
Oh, slow down, slow down.

54:56.927 --> 55:01.430
Yeah, yeah,
here comes the good stuff.

55:02.900 --> 55:05.868
Oh, oh, god dammit, why?

55:05.870 --> 55:07.770
Why?

55:07.772 --> 55:09.638
--Dude.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.073
Ugh!

55:11.075 --> 55:13.342
Everyone can
fucking see you!

55:13.344 --> 55:14.677
You know that
that chick has a dick, right?

55:14.679 --> 55:17.313
-Yeah, thanks.
-I support masturbation.

55:17.315 --> 55:19.315
--Whew!

55:21.485 --> 55:24.820
Hey, you're not--
you're not gonna mention this...

55:24.822 --> 55:26.355
--...to anyone are you?

55:26.357 --> 55:28.891
'Cause I'm--
I'm a little just,

55:28.893 --> 55:30.893
you know,
embarrassed about it.

55:30.895 --> 55:34.396
I would never do that.

55:34.398 --> 55:36.732
No, I'm serious.
Why would I go and tell anybody

55:36.734 --> 55:38.600
that's private-- it's personal,
that I walked in on you.

55:38.602 --> 55:40.102
-It's totally fine.
-Thank you.

55:40.104 --> 55:42.104
Don't be embarrassed.
I've done weird shit.

55:42.106 --> 55:44.640
Like eat half a pizza.

55:47.111 --> 55:51.380
Why don't you have
any friends, seriously?

55:51.382 --> 55:54.383
Hum. Um...

55:54.385 --> 55:56.385
Ow, that kinda--

55:56.387 --> 55:57.720
no.

55:57.722 --> 55:59.421
I mean,
what the fuck are you?

55:59.423 --> 56:00.923
No, I didn't mean it like that,
i meant like,

56:00.925 --> 56:02.791
why don't you have, like,
friends, other than me?

56:02.793 --> 56:04.660
Like, friends your--
your own age, 'cause you're--

56:04.662 --> 56:06.662
you're so, I mean, you...

56:06.664 --> 56:08.664
I don't know.
People are idiots.

56:08.666 --> 56:10.766
-Generally.
You're an idiot.
-Yeah, I am an idiot.

56:10.768 --> 56:12.101
Every--
you're just an idiot,
at all times.

56:12.103 --> 56:14.069
It's true.

56:14.071 --> 56:16.772
I mean, you're only
friends with me because
you wanna bang me.

56:16.774 --> 56:18.107
Oh, fuck, holy shit.

56:18.109 --> 56:20.642
It was a dream.
It was a dream.

56:20.644 --> 56:23.645
I had a sex dream
about my aunt merga, once. Okay?

56:23.647 --> 56:25.547
You shouldn't
tell people that.

56:25.549 --> 56:27.883
No, I'm making a--
I'm trying to make a point here.

56:27.885 --> 56:31.053
All right,
that it doesn't mean,
it's nothing.

56:31.055 --> 56:34.590
It's just a dream.
Okay?

56:34.592 --> 56:36.592
I mean, what's so wrong
about me, anyway?

56:36.594 --> 56:38.060
What?

56:38.062 --> 56:39.828
I mean, why wouldn't you
want to bang me?

56:39.830 --> 56:41.530
You keep saying,
"no I would never do that,"

56:41.532 --> 56:43.832
but I mean, do I, like, do I,
am I repulsive?

56:43.834 --> 56:46.535
Why would you
wanna have sex with me?
I mean, does that...

56:46.537 --> 56:48.537
No, no,
that's not what I said,
i didn't say that.

56:48.539 --> 56:49.905
But you didn't not
say that, right?

56:49.907 --> 56:51.774
-Okay.
-You did not say that.

56:51.776 --> 56:54.076
Wow. You should be
a detective.

56:54.078 --> 56:55.778
-Really?
-Yeah.

56:55.780 --> 56:57.880
- No. No.
-Why, you think I should

56:57.882 --> 57:01.049
go get a badge or something?

57:01.051 --> 57:03.819
I'll get you
a detective badge.

57:03.821 --> 57:06.155
-Thanks.
-Hmm.

57:06.157 --> 57:07.990
- What?

57:14.197 --> 57:17.666
Whoa, what...
What're you doing?

57:17.668 --> 57:19.701
Oh, god.

57:19.703 --> 57:22.504
What're you...?

57:22.506 --> 57:24.173
What're you doing right now?

57:24.175 --> 57:25.941
I'm bored.

57:37.587 --> 57:38.987
What's happening right now?

57:43.092 --> 57:47.696
Well, um,
nothing is happening, Chester.

57:49.933 --> 57:51.533
Oh, shit.

57:51.535 --> 57:53.502
I'm sorry.

57:53.504 --> 57:55.571
I just made it--
i made it really weird here.

57:55.573 --> 57:58.640
I'm-- i--
i feel really stupid.

57:58.642 --> 58:00.843
-Oh, you feel really stupid?
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

58:00.845 --> 58:03.045
That's how you feel
right now?

58:03.047 --> 58:04.480
Fuck you, Chester.

58:34.811 --> 58:39.515
Hey, it's Polly.

58:39.517 --> 58:41.650
I'm coming to your orgy.

58:50.026 --> 58:51.827
Happy orgy day!

58:51.829 --> 58:54.963
-Shh.
-Right?

58:54.965 --> 58:58.567
-And Chester...
-Yes.

58:58.569 --> 59:00.002
Hey, everyone. Hi.

59:02.071 --> 59:04.273
Polly, you look,
you look really nice.

59:04.275 --> 59:07.843
Oh, do I?

59:07.845 --> 59:09.244
Well, let's get
started, shall we?

59:09.246 --> 59:10.679
I call Cassie.

59:10.681 --> 59:12.714
What? No.

59:12.716 --> 59:14.216
Oh, come on, I'm really
in the mood to have sex

59:14.218 --> 59:15.684
with someone
I've never been
with before.

59:15.686 --> 59:18.020
She said "no,"
you know?

59:18.022 --> 59:20.122
Why don't you
just take another shot
at Heather, there?

59:20.124 --> 59:22.324
Hmm?

59:22.326 --> 59:25.227
- What?

59:25.229 --> 59:27.829
In high school I put his penis
in my mouth a little.

59:27.831 --> 59:31.133
-Oh, jeez.
-She didn't say I have
a small penis.

59:31.135 --> 59:33.135
-No, she kind of did.
-Okay.

59:33.137 --> 59:35.170
So those two are out,
and I'm not really into Polly?

59:35.172 --> 59:36.805
What the shit?

59:36.807 --> 59:38.807
Do you want to have
sex with me?

59:38.809 --> 59:40.208
I don't feel comfortable
answering that question.

59:40.210 --> 59:42.077
Thank you very much.
So Cassie and I then.

59:42.079 --> 59:46.615
Well, i-- I wanna have sex,
uh, with Spencer.

59:46.617 --> 59:48.951
Are you serious?

59:48.953 --> 59:51.053
Spencer's gay.

59:51.055 --> 59:52.821
You're the only one in town
who actually thinks that.

59:52.823 --> 59:55.691
Oh, seriously?
Really?

59:55.693 --> 59:57.693
What about that fruity
real estate job you have?

59:57.695 --> 59:59.161
What about your hair?
The clothes?

59:59.163 --> 01:00:02.030
-That awesome Cologne?
-I don't wear Cologne.

01:00:02.032 --> 01:00:03.198
That's just me.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.068
Okay.

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:07.769
Cassie wants to have sex
with Spencer.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:09.371
Who else wants to have sex
with Spencer?

01:00:09.373 --> 01:00:12.341
Oh, for fucks sake.
Who are you sleeping with then?

01:00:12.343 --> 01:00:15.043
-Adam.
-No, I don't think so.

01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:16.378
Oh, guess what, Heather?

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.913
Cock-blocking isn't
actually on the list

01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:20.048
of things to do
in an orgy.

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:22.651
So, why don't
you let Adam decide who he'd
like to stick it in.

01:00:22.653 --> 01:00:24.786
Oh, okay. Um...

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:28.657
You know, you're all
wonderful people,

01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:30.659
and um...

01:00:30.661 --> 01:00:33.996
-Polly would be--
-awkward.

01:00:33.998 --> 01:00:36.698
-And weird.
-Okay.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.701
You know, Alice,
i think my main concern
with you is that

01:00:39.703 --> 01:00:42.304
I wouldn't be able
to meet your level
of experience.

01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:45.741
Go fuck yourself.

01:00:45.743 --> 01:00:50.879
So I guess
i choose Cassie.

01:00:50.881 --> 01:00:52.414
Too late,
i already called
dibs on her.

01:00:52.416 --> 01:00:55.283
Okay, stop it. I'm...
I'm not participating

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:57.119
in anything where
dibs take precedence.

01:00:57.121 --> 01:00:59.655
Have sex with me,
please.

01:00:59.657 --> 01:01:02.958
-I said no.
-God, you are such
a hypocrite, Cassie.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.260
You, you, you, you run off
with your vagina

01:01:05.262 --> 01:01:07.029
and your-- your...
Sexy article things,

01:01:07.031 --> 01:01:08.930
and then you have an issue
sleeping with some

01:01:08.932 --> 01:01:11.333
mildly-annoying person that
you've known your entire life?

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:14.069
No, you do not
get to be a prude,
and the town slut,

01:01:14.071 --> 01:01:16.371
you're having sex with Bruce,
and that's that.

01:01:16.373 --> 01:01:19.875
Jesus fucking Christ,
Heather, she's not a slut,
she's just a virgin.

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:27.416
Yeah...

01:01:27.418 --> 01:01:29.751
Cassie's a virgin.

01:01:29.753 --> 01:01:30.919
That would be rich.

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:37.325
But I everything that I know
about sex is because of...

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:39.895
-Your column.
-Yeah, me too.

01:01:39.897 --> 01:01:43.799
This makes a lot of sense.

01:01:43.801 --> 01:01:46.334
I'd like you all
to leave now.

01:01:46.336 --> 01:01:49.738
Okay. Okay,
I'm sure this is extremely
embarrassing for you,

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:53.975
but we've all been
looking forward to this,
so I think that we should--

01:01:53.977 --> 01:01:55.977
-get out.
-We're having
our carpets cleaned,

01:01:55.979 --> 01:01:57.979
-there's nowhere else to go.
-Get out!

01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:01.183
-It's her house,
you guys, just--
-shut up, Alice.

01:02:01.185 --> 01:02:02.317
You get the fuck out first.

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:20.202
Alice. Hey, Alice.
Alice, excuse me.

01:02:20.204 --> 01:02:21.737
-Hey, hey, hey--
-don't.

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:23.071
What the fuck
do you want, Bruce?

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:25.040
Hey, what the fuck
were you doing in there?

01:02:25.042 --> 01:02:26.408
You really ruined
that for me in there.
What're you doing?

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.410
I-- I could not
give a Baker's fuck.

01:02:28.412 --> 01:02:30.946
A Baker's fuck?
What, 13 fucks-- what
are you talking about?

01:02:30.948 --> 01:02:35.951
-That's 13 fucks...
-Do you have any idea
how much I needed this?

01:02:35.953 --> 01:02:38.954
First,
you embarrass me
by leaving me,

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:40.989
and then you rub it
in my fucking face

01:02:40.991 --> 01:02:42.858
by getting it on
with every single
yuy in town.

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:44.359
You know, you--

01:02:44.361 --> 01:02:46.061
-you're embarrassing.
-I'm embarrassing?

01:02:46.063 --> 01:02:48.230
-Yeah.
-You're pathetic.

01:02:48.232 --> 01:02:49.998
-You need to sign
our divorce papers.
-You want pathetic?

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.435
No. Not until
you tell me why.

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:55.137
Really? Do you
really not know why?

01:02:55.139 --> 01:02:56.471
Because, if I recall,

01:02:56.473 --> 01:02:58.173
you didn't touch me
for like, a year.

01:02:58.175 --> 01:03:00.876
And you're acting
like a victim, in--

01:03:00.878 --> 01:03:03.845
-oh, what? 'Cause
you're so innocent?
-I had some sex.

01:03:03.847 --> 01:03:06.014
-Some?
-I may have over-compensated.

01:03:06.016 --> 01:03:08.984
-Oh, yeah, you think?
-You broke my heart!

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:12.821
My fucking heart!

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:15.390
Asshole.

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:18.927
Sign the fucking papers.

01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:20.562
It's the least
you could do.

01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:29.571
So, I have been thinking
about the orgy...

01:03:29.573 --> 01:03:30.939
The orgy's cancelled.

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:33.041
No, I'm Heather Mitchell,

01:03:33.043 --> 01:03:35.243
-no one cancels
a social event on me.
-Heather.

01:03:35.245 --> 01:03:39.147
Honey, please,
will you just forget about
the orgy and come to bed.

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:42.350
Adam, I am trying
to figure out a way to keep
this orgy going.

01:03:42.352 --> 01:03:44.853
The last thing
i have time for right now
is to have sex with you.

01:03:44.855 --> 01:03:46.154
Why is it
so important to you?

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:48.323
To us,
it's important to us.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.225
No, it isn't.

01:03:50.227 --> 01:03:52.227
I thought we were trying
to have a baby, that's the goal.

01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:54.429
And that is exactly why
the orgy is so important.

01:03:54.431 --> 01:03:56.464
What are you talking about?

01:04:00.136 --> 01:04:01.203
Okay...

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:06.107
Look, I, um...

01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:07.843
What?

01:04:07.845 --> 01:04:10.846
I don't want you to take
this the wrong way, but...

01:04:10.848 --> 01:04:12.447
I had your sperm tested.

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:17.252
It's just we've been
trying for a really long time,

01:04:17.254 --> 01:04:19.454
and I got tested first,
and everything was fine,

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:22.457
so, it was the next step.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.327
What-- what do you mean?

01:04:25.329 --> 01:04:26.494
I didn't give you any sperm.

01:04:26.496 --> 01:04:27.863
How'd you get my sperm?

01:04:29.498 --> 01:04:34.502
Well, when you make deposits,
i make withdrawls.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:39.107
You...

01:04:42.478 --> 01:04:43.912
Oh, my god.

01:04:43.914 --> 01:04:47.215
Uh... uh...

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:49.417
Okay.

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.520
And...

01:04:52.522 --> 01:04:54.322
They said that you have
the worst sperm

01:04:54.324 --> 01:04:56.057
that they've ever seen.

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:57.425
We can get
a second opinion.

01:04:57.427 --> 01:04:59.027
I got five.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:06.668
So you were using
this orgy

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:08.904
as some sort
of sperm bank?

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:10.505
That wasn't
the original plan.

01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:12.574
You wanted to get pregnant,
and then...

01:05:12.576 --> 01:05:15.143
Trick me into raising
the child with you

01:05:15.145 --> 01:05:16.678
with complete disregard
for the fact

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.113
the kid would look
nothing like me.

01:05:18.115 --> 01:05:19.981
I have to be a mother,
Adam. Okay?

01:05:19.983 --> 01:05:21.116
I mean, I wouldn't
have married you if i--

01:05:21.118 --> 01:05:22.951
please, go on.

01:05:22.953 --> 01:05:27.122
Honey, I'm just...
I'm being emotional.

01:05:27.124 --> 01:05:31.593
Oh, I would hate for
Heather Mitchell to ever
have an emotion.

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:34.095
I had to learn
to love you.

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:40.001
-That came out wrong.
-Did it?

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:47.375
- Okay.

01:06:32.288 --> 01:06:34.356
You kept the tape?

01:06:34.358 --> 01:06:39.094
Uh, just getting rid
of the rest of my old junk
before I leave.

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:42.697
So you're,
you're going?

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:45.400
Well, the whole town
found out my deepest,
darkest, secret.

01:06:45.402 --> 01:06:48.269
So, yeah,
I'm gonna go.

01:06:48.271 --> 01:06:50.438
Everybody has bad days
apparently.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.774
And mine's gonna get even worse
until I leave this shit-hole.

01:06:52.776 --> 01:06:54.609
So, if you'll excuse me.

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:57.112
What if you don't leave?

01:06:57.114 --> 01:07:00.448
Well, then I'll have to stay.

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:03.785
And everybody knows
I'm a fraud and a virgin,

01:07:03.787 --> 01:07:07.455
and I can't look anybody
in the eye ever again.

01:07:07.457 --> 01:07:10.125
You're looking me
in the eye right now.

01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:15.330
You know,
I'm pretty good at it.

01:07:15.332 --> 01:07:16.765
Uh-huh.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:22.804
Look, um.

01:07:22.806 --> 01:07:24.806
Cassie, when you left town
the first time

01:07:24.808 --> 01:07:29.177
it was the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

01:07:29.179 --> 01:07:32.180
I've never forgotten about you.
I think about you all the time.

01:07:32.182 --> 01:07:33.681
I mean,
the only reason that I'm--

01:07:33.683 --> 01:07:35.283
the only reason
i married Heather,

01:07:35.285 --> 01:07:38.553
is, uh-- you know,
i get it, okay?

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:40.221
I get it.
You-- you had to do
what you had to do.

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:41.556
You had to get out of town,

01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:43.691
you had to leave us
all behind.

01:07:43.693 --> 01:07:46.694
You had to just go do your
own thing and that's fine, okay?

01:07:46.696 --> 01:07:48.396
I forgive you.

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:52.500
You forgive me?

01:07:52.502 --> 01:07:55.503
Yeah. Yes, I forgive you.

01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:58.773
You forgive me?

01:07:58.775 --> 01:08:01.376
Do you have no idea
why I didn't leave town

01:08:01.378 --> 01:08:04.112
the second after that funeral?

01:08:04.114 --> 01:08:06.181
It's because I thought
you and your idiot friends

01:08:06.183 --> 01:08:10.251
would be good material
for a book, but you're not.

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:14.389
You're just a bunch
of sad, boring, bumpkins,
who were born here,

01:08:14.391 --> 01:08:15.824
and will die here

01:08:15.826 --> 01:08:17.859
and accomplish nothing
inbetween.

01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:28.403
Does becoming a bitch count
as an accomplishment?

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:32.474
Please leave.
I have packing to do.

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:33.608
Yeah, I'm going thank you.

01:08:49.825 --> 01:08:53.161
-Tada!
-What's that for?

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:55.162
-It's for you.
-It's just weird.

01:08:55.165 --> 01:08:57.332
You've never
done that before. So...

01:08:57.334 --> 01:08:59.634
Yeah, I thought
it would be nice.

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:03.138
Okay. You know you don't
owe me anything, right?

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.140
That I'm not some,
like, little girl,

01:09:05.142 --> 01:09:06.908
whose feelings
have been hurt?

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:11.446
Relax, okay? It was...

01:09:11.448 --> 01:09:13.615
It's just a muffin, okay?
It's not even a good one.

01:09:13.617 --> 01:09:15.383
I gave you the one
that I dropped.

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:22.490
I put my notice in.

01:09:23.725 --> 01:09:25.527
What? What are
you talking about?

01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:27.395
This town sucks,
it's always sucked.

01:09:27.397 --> 01:09:29.796
So...
I am out of here.

01:09:29.799 --> 01:09:32.267
I don't want to become
like my cousin Heather.

01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:34.636
You know, just settle
for somebody just because
they're there.

01:09:34.638 --> 01:09:37.505
You should do the same.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.174
Or not, I don't know.

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.810
It's not really fair
for me to say it, I guess.

01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:46.848
You do you.

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:49.817
All I know
is that leaving here scares
the shit out of me,

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:52.187
and if you're
scared of something,
it's worth doing.

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:55.223
So, I am gonna do that.

01:09:55.225 --> 01:09:58.493
Anyway, thank you
for the dropped muffin.

01:10:14.678 --> 01:10:17.579
Jay macmaster and his wife
are gonna be delayed.

01:10:17.581 --> 01:10:19.681
You're gonna
have to get over this.

01:10:19.683 --> 01:10:21.783
I feel like there's a hole
inside of me, man.

01:10:21.785 --> 01:10:26.654
Could I be perfectly frank
with you right now?

01:10:26.656 --> 01:10:28.756
-Of course.
-Stop being such a little bitch

01:10:28.758 --> 01:10:31.259
and do what you want.

01:10:31.261 --> 01:10:34.462
I want to have the orgy.

01:10:34.464 --> 01:10:38.366
-So, have the orgy.
-I can't.

01:10:38.368 --> 01:10:40.969
Cassie kicked everyone out.

01:10:40.971 --> 01:10:43.338
So, how does that stop you?

01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:47.942
If you have it, though,
i wanna come.

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:49.978
No, you're not getting
the commission on my house.

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:54.415
That's fine.
I'm making a killing
in this town.

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:57.418
Oh, god, if I didn't
want to be you, I would
hate you so much.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.821
-What was that?
-What? Nothing, I didn't--

01:10:59.823 --> 01:11:02.457
did you...

01:11:02.459 --> 01:11:04.659
Okay.

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:13.401
Jesus Christ.

01:11:13.403 --> 01:11:14.802
I want to rent
my own apartment.

01:11:14.804 --> 01:11:17.272
Well, I'm a bit busy
right now, okay, Seth?

01:11:17.274 --> 01:11:19.474
I have to move out now
before my mom gets back to
town, or she won't let me.

01:11:19.476 --> 01:11:21.643
Whatever.

01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:25.513
But you're in that house
right now all by yourself?

01:11:25.515 --> 01:11:27.482
Yeah, she gets
back next week.

01:11:27.484 --> 01:11:29.951
Do you want to have
a party, Seth?

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:33.321
Why, so, so no one
will show up?

01:11:33.323 --> 01:11:35.990
-No thanks.
-No, no, people will show up.
I can promise you that.

01:11:35.992 --> 01:11:39.894
-Like, girls?
-Girls, totally.
Tons of girls.

01:11:39.896 --> 01:11:41.863
-Do they like videogames?
-Yeah, yeah.
They love videogames.

01:11:41.865 --> 01:11:44.032
-Any thing you want, yeah.
-Are they Japanese?

01:11:44.034 --> 01:11:46.734
Sure, yeah.
Yeah, Japanese girls,
yeah, totally.

01:11:46.736 --> 01:11:48.436
-Chinese girls.
-No.

01:11:48.438 --> 01:11:50.972
-Okay.
-No Chinese.

01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:53.641
Yeah, okay,
no, no Chinese girls.

01:11:57.946 --> 01:12:01.649
-Hey.
-Bruce.

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:05.386
So, you still wanna
do this thing?

01:12:05.388 --> 01:12:06.888
Great okay, cool.

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:09.390
Maybe, maybe lose the pajamas,
get more cleavage,

01:12:09.392 --> 01:12:10.758
like, sexy, cleavage.

01:12:12.027 --> 01:12:13.428
Like, right now.

01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:19.634
Hi, so I think we found a way
to keep the orgy going.

01:12:19.636 --> 01:12:23.638
- I don't know.

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:26.107
Vintage vinyl,
all sale's final.
This is Chester.

01:12:26.109 --> 01:12:28.443
It's back on.
Seth's place.

01:12:28.445 --> 01:12:31.112
-Tonight.
-Ding-dong.

01:12:31.114 --> 01:12:33.581
Ding, ding,
I'll be there.

01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:35.883
Good afternoon, mayor.

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:37.785
Nice to see you, Heather.

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:39.787
So, there's no delicate way
to put this,

01:12:39.789 --> 01:12:41.489
so I'm just gonna
come right out with it.

01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:43.057
We're having an orgy
this evening,

01:12:43.059 --> 01:12:44.726
and we could use some
additional pensises,

01:12:44.728 --> 01:12:46.861
if you would care to attend?

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:48.396
Oh, absolutely.

01:12:48.398 --> 01:12:50.732
Do you guys have
your own anal beads, or...

01:12:50.734 --> 01:12:53.568
Is this more
of a byoab kind of thing?

01:13:05.648 --> 01:13:08.716
So, where shall
we fornicate, Bruce?

01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:18.059
Yeah!

01:13:49.925 --> 01:13:51.859
-Cocktail?
-No, no thanks.

01:13:51.861 --> 01:13:53.528
Boys?

01:13:59.635 --> 01:14:01.602
There's my guy.

01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:02.970
-Hey
-hey.

01:14:02.972 --> 01:14:05.473
I'm so glad
that you could make it.

01:14:05.475 --> 01:14:06.808
I'm really glad
i could come.

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:08.443
I'm even happier
when you do.

01:14:08.445 --> 01:14:09.777
--Are you okay?

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:10.845
-Got a little...
-Yeah, I'm good.

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:15.550
Why is my living room
like a whore dungeon?

01:14:15.552 --> 01:14:18.653
What are you guys doing
with my mom's pashminas?

01:14:18.655 --> 01:14:21.189
-She loves those.
-For the orgy.

01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:23.558
What orgy?
This is a party.

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.059
Yeah, yeah, it's a party.

01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:26.594
It's a party
for your penis, bro.

01:14:26.596 --> 01:14:28.596
I don't want a penis party
for my penis.

01:14:28.598 --> 01:14:31.232
I want a party party for me.

01:14:33.769 --> 01:14:35.102
Hey, where you going?

01:14:35.104 --> 01:14:37.538
I'm gonna go play
some video games.

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.540
Does anybody
want to play with me?

01:14:39.542 --> 01:14:41.876
No, maybe later, man.
Maybe later.

01:14:58.627 --> 01:15:01.996
So, do you wanna go somewhere?

01:15:05.268 --> 01:15:08.503
It doesn't bother me at all
that you ejaculated quickly.

01:15:08.505 --> 01:15:12.573
That is a sign
of a man who has his
priorities straight.

01:15:12.575 --> 01:15:13.941
But there is
something else that...

01:15:13.943 --> 01:15:17.278
Why don't you finish
that drink?

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:20.147
-For you...
-Yeah?

01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:21.616
That might tickle
your fantasy...

01:15:21.618 --> 01:15:25.853
Oh, and there it is. Okay.

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:27.889
Polly, can i--
can I talk to you, please?

01:15:27.891 --> 01:15:29.857
Guess what?
I want you to know that I think
that you're kind of...

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:32.026
We're sort of in the middle
of something here, sport.

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:34.762
Uh, yeah, give me a second,
okay, Spencer?

01:15:34.764 --> 01:15:39.000
I just want you to know that
i think you're really beautiful.

01:15:39.002 --> 01:15:42.837
And that I just-- I think you're
fucking amazing.

01:15:42.839 --> 01:15:46.073
I-- I screwed up
the other night, okay?

01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:47.875
It's fine.
You know what, Chester,

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:49.577
it was,
it really was nothing.

01:15:49.579 --> 01:15:53.781
No. It's not fine. Okay,
and it wasn't nothing.

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:55.917
And you weren't bored.

01:15:55.919 --> 01:15:59.220
This is worth doing.

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:03.057
Yeah? How do you know?

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:05.626
'Cause I'm scared shitless.

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:12.833
Whoa, I declare
this orgy officially...

01:16:12.835 --> 01:16:15.136
Begun! Yeah!

01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:22.910
-Adam.
-Do you know
where Cassie is?

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:25.813
-No.
-I think she left town.

01:16:25.815 --> 01:16:28.215
-Without saying, goodbye?
-Wouldn't she?

01:16:28.217 --> 01:16:30.985
Bitch.

01:16:30.987 --> 01:16:33.154
Guess you don't
want to go to Seth's either?

01:16:33.156 --> 01:16:34.589
What at-- I was at Seth's.

01:16:34.591 --> 01:16:36.090
What do you think?

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:38.259
Really?

01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:40.628
Heather was the one
that told me...

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:41.963
How do you not
know about this?

01:16:46.835 --> 01:16:48.836
I want you inside
of me right now.

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:54.675
-Come here.
-Things are progressing nicely.

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.814
Oh, this is my cue.

01:16:59.816 --> 01:17:02.283
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What, yeah,

01:17:02.285 --> 01:17:06.187
take this off.
Yeah, just, yeah,
yeah, whatever.

01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:08.289
Yeah, now we're better.

01:17:09.859 --> 01:17:11.659
Yeah.

01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:16.631
Come on, guys.
Come on, let's ease up
on the kissing.

01:17:16.633 --> 01:17:18.833
Come on, guys,
let's use our mouths

01:17:18.835 --> 01:17:20.334
for the greater good here.

01:17:20.336 --> 01:17:22.370
Bruce.

01:17:22.372 --> 01:17:23.804
Oh, yeah.

01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:26.140
-Oh, yeah.
-Bruce!

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:28.809
What? What?
It's a goddamn fucking orgy.

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:30.711
If you've got a hole
and you're not using it,
then you're being selfish.

01:17:30.713 --> 01:17:32.046
Clearly, they're
having a moment.

01:17:32.048 --> 01:17:34.081
Well if they're having
a fucking moment,

01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:35.950
then they should take
this fucking romantic
moment to a room.

01:17:35.952 --> 01:17:37.952
Yeah, come on.
Room. Room.

01:17:37.954 --> 01:17:39.687
No, no, I didn't mean it.
I didn't actually--

01:17:39.689 --> 01:17:40.988
I was just just saying it!
I was just just saying it,

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:41.989
like, in the heat
of the moment.

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:43.357
It wasn't sexy-- ow, fuck!

01:17:52.768 --> 01:17:55.269
-Hello?
-Hey.

01:17:55.271 --> 01:17:57.204
You left without
saying, "goodbye"?

01:17:57.206 --> 01:17:59.273
Fuck you, Judas.

01:17:59.275 --> 01:18:02.109
Are you kidding?
I saved you.

01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:05.046
From losing your virginity
to fucking Bruce.

01:18:05.048 --> 01:18:08.049
You would really, really
want to hold that against me?

01:18:08.051 --> 01:18:10.051
I trusted you with that.

01:18:10.053 --> 01:18:12.053
You know how hard it is
for me to trust people?

01:18:12.055 --> 01:18:14.455
Yeah, sorry.
You should just get
the fuck over it.

01:18:14.457 --> 01:18:17.458
-When did you leave?
-Just now.

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:19.427
Okay, come back.

01:18:19.429 --> 01:18:21.796
I can't. I'm on the lam.

01:18:21.798 --> 01:18:23.464
The book people
are gonna come after me.

01:18:23.466 --> 01:18:25.332
My career's over,
life's over--

01:18:25.334 --> 01:18:27.835
why don't you
just write a book?

01:18:27.837 --> 01:18:29.370
Yeah, what am I supposed
to write about?

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:32.707
A-- a virgin who plans
an orgy for a bunch of prudes?

01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:34.041
And then out myself

01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:36.177
to the entire world
in the process?

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:40.314
That's not bad,
actually.

01:18:40.316 --> 01:18:43.117
You said your careers
over anyway, so it saves you

01:18:43.119 --> 01:18:45.352
from having to remember
a bunch of bullshit lies

01:18:45.354 --> 01:18:46.487
all the time.

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:50.057
These people
don't want me here.

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:52.226
Adam just
came looking for you.

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:54.195
Yeah, I saw
him last night.

01:18:54.197 --> 01:18:58.899
You did?
So, you know about
him and Heather?

01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:01.402
What about him and Heather?

01:19:08.043 --> 01:19:09.510
Stop the orgy!

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:30.131
Heather?

01:19:30.133 --> 01:19:33.968
-Do you have something
you want to say?
-No.

01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:36.303
How nice of you
to join us.

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:37.805
Are you gonna tell
them, or should I?

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:41.108
What's going on, here?

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:42.943
My money's on gonorrhea.

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:46.113
Gentlemen, the uh,
the only reason

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:49.383
that Heather
wants to sleep with you,

01:19:49.385 --> 01:19:51.886
the only reason that
this whole thing is happening
in the first place,

01:19:51.888 --> 01:19:54.221
is because Heather Murray,

01:19:54.223 --> 01:19:56.891
is trying to get pregnant.

01:19:56.893 --> 01:19:59.560
And she doesn't want
your DNA in the mix.
Yeah, I get that.

01:19:59.562 --> 01:20:02.096
No, not-- that's not
what I'm saying.

01:20:02.098 --> 01:20:05.566
First of all,
i have dead sperm,
apparently, okay?

01:20:05.568 --> 01:20:08.102
That's not-- the point is,
this whole thing

01:20:08.104 --> 01:20:09.837
is based on a lie.
All right?

01:20:09.839 --> 01:20:13.007
And Cassie who we slut-shamed
out of town years ago,

01:20:13.009 --> 01:20:15.342
now, she's leaving town
again because she's a virgin?

01:20:15.344 --> 01:20:17.344
Huh? How does
that make sense?

01:20:17.346 --> 01:20:19.880
And, and what, we're doing this
to prove that we're not prudes?

01:20:19.882 --> 01:20:22.550
You know what?
I'm a prude, okay? I am.

01:20:22.552 --> 01:20:24.251
I don't-- I don't wanna
have sex in front of anybody.

01:20:24.253 --> 01:20:26.120
I want it to be me
and one other person.

01:20:26.122 --> 01:20:29.423
Nobody watching,
no-- no toys, no lubes.

01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:32.193
Just vanilla.
That's me, I'm vanilla.

01:20:32.195 --> 01:20:34.195
As for the rest of you--
i mean I don't even know

01:20:34.197 --> 01:20:36.897
how you could have sex
in front of-- look at this.

01:20:36.899 --> 01:20:39.233
You know how much confidence
it takes to lay naked like
that on somebody's couch?

01:20:39.235 --> 01:20:41.602
-You ever been in
this house before?
-Yeah, never.

01:20:41.604 --> 01:20:44.138
And yet it's like
he lives here.

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:47.508
Good for you.
But you know what?
Be yourself, all right?

01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:49.510
Everybody just be
themselves and be honest.

01:20:49.512 --> 01:20:51.879
Is this all true, Heather?

01:20:51.881 --> 01:20:54.381
You want us
to impregnate you?

01:20:54.383 --> 01:20:56.483
Nobody ever has to know.

01:20:58.054 --> 01:21:01.121
All I've ever wanted
was to be a mother.

01:21:01.123 --> 01:21:04.458
And they say that it takes
a village to raise a child--

01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:08.963
-I'm down with it, shh-sh...
-Me too.

01:21:08.965 --> 01:21:11.966
Would we have to help
raise the kid?

01:21:11.968 --> 01:21:13.634
No I just need
your sperm.

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:15.636
Don't care.

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:20.307
Do that you gotta do.

01:21:20.309 --> 01:21:22.977
But I'm... I'm out.

01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:31.018
-So, who's first?
-Me.

01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:33.187
-How about you go third?
-What? Oh, come on!

01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:35.022
Gus is gonna go before me?

01:21:35.024 --> 01:21:36.657
You don't want to have
a samoan baby.

01:21:36.659 --> 01:21:40.160
How is it that no one
in this town knows what I am?

01:21:40.162 --> 01:21:42.329
-I'm Indian.
-No, you're not.

01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:44.999
Dot, not feather.

01:21:45.001 --> 01:21:47.668
Actually, you people make
really beautiful mixed babies.

01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:49.370
-I'm first.
-Okay.

01:21:49.372 --> 01:21:51.205
Oh, okay.
All right, yes.

01:21:51.207 --> 01:21:54.208
Here we go, let's do this.
Let's do this, here we go--

01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:57.244
-what?
-Nothing, I thought
you'd be smaller.

01:22:29.345 --> 01:22:31.345
How do you do that?

01:22:31.347 --> 01:22:34.315
Your tongue, it's like
an olympic athlete.

01:22:37.018 --> 01:22:39.687
I'm gonna give you
this ice cream on a cone.

01:22:39.689 --> 01:22:43.357
And what flavor am I?

01:22:43.359 --> 01:22:45.359
Tiger tale.

01:22:45.361 --> 01:22:49.029
No, tiger tale
is disgusting.

01:22:49.031 --> 01:22:51.031
Do my lady bits
taste like black licorice?

01:22:51.033 --> 01:22:53.267
I love black licorice.

01:23:20.628 --> 01:23:22.329
Oh, god.

01:23:27.302 --> 01:23:29.303
Cassie.

01:23:29.305 --> 01:23:33.307
Oh my god, I'm so glad
you came back.

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:37.344
There's so much stuff
i wanna say about last night,

01:23:37.346 --> 01:23:40.347
I shouldn't have-- okay...

01:23:40.349 --> 01:23:43.584
-If you wanna talk first,
that's fine, too.
-Fuck you.

01:23:43.586 --> 01:23:47.187
God, I've been wanting
to do that for so long.

01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:49.556
I mean, if this
is part of some sort of,
uh, big-city foreplay

01:23:49.558 --> 01:23:51.091
I'm-- you're gonna have
to walk me through.

01:24:09.344 --> 01:24:11.412
There's a musk.

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:51.251
So, have you fucked
anyone, yet?

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:54.488
-No.
-Okay.

01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:58.826
Well, where
should we do this?

01:24:58.828 --> 01:25:00.561
Do what?

01:25:00.563 --> 01:25:03.130
The sex.
We're going to bang.

01:25:03.132 --> 01:25:05.432
That's okay.

01:25:08.303 --> 01:25:13.173
I'm offering you
farm-fresh, free range,

01:25:13.175 --> 01:25:15.709
grade a pussy here.

01:25:15.711 --> 01:25:18.579
Yeah, you don't
have to do that.
I'm fine.

01:25:18.581 --> 01:25:21.815
Fine? What--
what is this?
What is this?

01:25:21.817 --> 01:25:25.185
What's your deal?
Are you not attracted to me?

01:25:29.624 --> 01:25:31.225
You're okay.

01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:37.431
I'm sorry,
what sort of bar

01:25:37.433 --> 01:25:39.700
are we comparing me to,
porn stars?

01:25:39.702 --> 01:25:43.137
-Mostly, yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

01:25:43.139 --> 01:25:45.572
I hate to tell you this,
sweetie, but,

01:25:45.574 --> 01:25:49.910
those women
aren't actually real.

01:25:49.912 --> 01:25:51.879
What's so real about you?

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:57.317
That's it.
It's on.

01:25:57.319 --> 01:25:59.720
- Oh, fuck. This is so nice.

01:25:59.722 --> 01:26:02.756
-This is just so nice.
-Oh, I'm not gonna make it,
I'm not gonna make it.

01:26:02.758 --> 01:26:06.326
-Not gonna make it.
-Okay. Okay,
218 x 4 million.

01:26:06.328 --> 01:26:07.861
What?
I don't understand that.

01:26:07.863 --> 01:26:09.730
-Just focus. Add.
-Focus on what?

01:26:19.641 --> 01:26:21.775
You know what
my dad used to say,

01:26:21.777 --> 01:26:24.211
"life gives you lemons,
you make lemonade."

01:26:24.213 --> 01:26:26.480
Absolutely, bro.

01:26:26.482 --> 01:26:28.348
A whole jug of it.

01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:33.520
-So, that's that, then.
-Yeah, that's that.

01:26:33.522 --> 01:26:38.225
--That's-- what's what?

01:26:38.227 --> 01:26:40.194
Let's make some lemonade.

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:46.567
Yeah, absolutely. Sure.

01:26:46.569 --> 01:26:50.971
So,
what-- what's happening?

01:26:50.973 --> 01:26:53.907
If you got a hole,
and you're not using it...

01:27:20.635 --> 01:27:24.972
-Does that hurt?
-The piercing, no.

01:27:24.974 --> 01:27:26.740
It's good.

01:27:26.742 --> 01:27:27.941
You sure it doesn't hurt?

01:27:27.943 --> 01:27:33.380
-Mm-hmm. Whoa!
-Oh, ah!

01:27:33.382 --> 01:27:36.917
-Can we just play
video games now?
-Yeah, absolutely, we can.

01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:44.324
How is it?

01:27:45.995 --> 01:27:48.562
Well, the stinging
has subsided,

01:27:48.564 --> 01:27:51.365
so that's something.

01:27:51.367 --> 01:27:54.001
I'm sorry.

01:27:54.003 --> 01:27:56.536
I just really
had to hurt you.

01:27:56.538 --> 01:28:00.407
Oh.
Well, mission accomplished.

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:05.045
Do you know
why I was afraid

01:28:05.047 --> 01:28:06.780
to come back here?

01:28:09.517 --> 01:28:13.453
Because I didn't want
to see you happy.

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:17.924
Well, you sure fixed your wish
with that one.

01:28:21.896 --> 01:28:24.364
What about you?

01:28:24.366 --> 01:28:26.300
Are you happy?

01:28:27.335 --> 01:28:30.637
I'm tired.

01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:31.838
All that stuff
i said last night

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:33.840
about forgiving you,
that was shitty.

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:36.843
It's not your fault

01:28:36.845 --> 01:28:38.578
that I married Heather,
or I stayed in town,

01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:41.315
it's got nothing
to do with you.

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:46.520
I'm the reason
that nothing happened

01:28:46.522 --> 01:28:48.622
between us.

01:28:50.692 --> 01:28:53.994
I guess I should be
asking you for forgiveness.

01:28:55.029 --> 01:28:56.663
So...

01:28:57.732 --> 01:28:59.466
I'm sorry.

01:29:01.369 --> 01:29:03.537
That's what I was gonna say
before you...

01:29:03.539 --> 01:29:05.939
Slapped me in the face
and kneed me in the balls.

01:29:05.941 --> 01:29:10.043
I'm sorry, for, um...

01:29:10.045 --> 01:29:11.511
All of it.

01:29:15.683 --> 01:29:17.751
How's your balls?

01:29:17.753 --> 01:29:21.355
Mmm.
Still intact, I guess.

01:29:21.357 --> 01:29:24.858
It's not like I'm gonna
be using them for anything.

01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:25.926
Ever.

01:29:28.896 --> 01:29:30.130
Can I see?

01:29:32.033 --> 01:29:35.602
It's not really
my best feature.

01:29:35.604 --> 01:29:37.904
Oh.

01:29:40.074 --> 01:29:44.678
You know, it doesn't feel
that useless to me.

01:29:47.382 --> 01:29:49.783
Cassie, I...

01:29:49.785 --> 01:29:50.951
Yeah?

01:30:15.877 --> 01:30:17.644
Did you get some lube?

01:30:17.646 --> 01:30:19.045
All I could find
was some apple butter.

01:30:19.047 --> 01:30:20.814
Yeah, sure, fine.
Fuck it. Whatever.

01:30:20.816 --> 01:30:22.149
--We don't have
to do this.

01:30:22.151 --> 01:30:24.017
No, we're gonna do this,
come on, come on.

01:30:24.019 --> 01:30:25.919
-Let's just do this,
all right?
-Yup. Here we go.

01:30:25.921 --> 01:30:27.554
Oh, whoa, hey,
what are you doing there,

01:30:27.556 --> 01:30:29.756
-captain?
-You need to be erect.

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:32.959
I can get myself erect,
thank you very much.

01:30:32.961 --> 01:30:35.095
-Be my guest. Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, watch this.

01:30:35.097 --> 01:30:36.897
Geez.

01:30:36.899 --> 01:30:38.165
Oh, look at that.

01:30:38.167 --> 01:30:40.567
--Oh, fuck.

01:30:40.569 --> 01:30:43.970
Uh, Auschwitz.
Uh, uh, dachau, dachau.

01:30:43.972 --> 01:30:47.908
-Uh, bergen-belsen.
Uh, terezin. Uh--
-wait, what?

01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:49.876
- What are you saying? What?
-Those are

01:30:49.878 --> 01:30:52.579
...concentration camps.
From the holocaust.

01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:57.050
Why? Is that too dark?
Too much?

01:30:57.052 --> 01:30:59.519
-Yeah, it's a little much.
-Okay.

01:31:02.690 --> 01:31:04.958
What is the appeal, here?

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:07.828
I mean, you just die
and then you do it
all over again.

01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:08.962
Yeah.

01:31:08.964 --> 01:31:10.797
That's what I like
about it.

01:31:10.799 --> 01:31:11.965
When Mario dies,

01:31:11.967 --> 01:31:13.567
he doesn't rage against
the world,

01:31:13.569 --> 01:31:16.036
he just picks himself up,

01:31:16.038 --> 01:31:18.171
goes back to the start
and tries again,

01:31:18.173 --> 01:31:22.008
until he figures out
how to save the Princess.

01:31:27.882 --> 01:31:29.516
Seth?

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:33.753
What's your plan?

01:31:33.755 --> 01:31:36.490
I mean, you can't really just
stay in your mother's basement

01:31:36.492 --> 01:31:39.726
and play video games
for the rest of your life.

01:31:39.728 --> 01:31:41.528
What other life
am I gonna have?

01:31:41.530 --> 01:31:43.096
I'm the town loser.

01:31:43.098 --> 01:31:46.733
Well, to the town, yeah.

01:31:46.735 --> 01:31:49.536
But, who are you to you?

01:31:49.538 --> 01:31:50.804
I mean,
they all see Clark Kent

01:31:50.806 --> 01:31:52.739
but...

01:31:52.741 --> 01:31:54.074
I'm pretty sure
there's a Kal-El

01:31:54.076 --> 01:31:55.709
hiding in there somewhere.

01:31:58.913 --> 01:32:00.647
I'm ready
to have sex with you now.

01:32:06.255 --> 01:32:08.054
It's not
so squishy this time.

01:32:08.056 --> 01:32:10.724
Yeah.

01:32:10.726 --> 01:32:12.158
Adam?

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:13.727
Yes?

01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:15.962
Adam Mitchell?

01:32:15.964 --> 01:32:18.899
Uh-huh?

01:32:18.901 --> 01:32:21.067
I think of you fondly.

01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:25.805
I am...

01:32:25.807 --> 01:32:27.741
Quite fond of you as well.

01:32:30.979 --> 01:32:33.079
Oh, thank you.

01:32:33.081 --> 01:32:34.314
You're welcome.

01:32:34.316 --> 01:32:35.615
Oh, thank you.

01:32:35.617 --> 01:32:38.818
Don't mention it.

01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:40.086
Okay.

01:32:41.856 --> 01:32:45.191
Okay, you just...

01:32:45.193 --> 01:32:47.127
You're over thinking it.
Just do it.

01:32:47.129 --> 01:32:48.628
I just don't
want to hurt you.

01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:49.829
You won't.

01:32:49.831 --> 01:32:51.064
Stop being
such a fucking pussy.

01:32:51.066 --> 01:32:52.766
Look, this is new for me.

01:32:52.768 --> 01:32:56.136
All right, I gotta need
some positive reinforcement.

01:32:57.573 --> 01:32:58.838
Look, I'm sorry.

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.607
Would you please
fuck my bum

01:33:00.609 --> 01:33:02.709
with your beautiful,
manly penis?

01:33:02.711 --> 01:33:04.277
-Hmm?
-Okay.

01:33:04.279 --> 01:33:07.047
-Good. All right.
Okay, here we go.
-Okay.

01:33:09.685 --> 01:33:10.850
- Okay.
-There you go.

01:33:11.853 --> 01:33:13.687
Oh.

01:33:16.023 --> 01:33:17.257
Oh.

01:33:17.259 --> 01:33:19.993
--Oh, oh.

01:33:19.995 --> 01:33:21.761
Okay.

01:33:21.763 --> 01:33:23.630
Ooh.

01:33:23.632 --> 01:33:25.632
--Oh.

01:33:25.634 --> 01:33:27.200
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

01:33:27.202 --> 01:33:28.668
-Fuck!
-Oh, shit!

01:33:28.670 --> 01:33:30.070
- Oh, keep going, Chester.

01:33:30.072 --> 01:33:31.805
-Oh, I'm going to go.
-Chester, keep going.

01:33:31.807 --> 01:33:32.806
-Keep going!
-Oh!

01:33:35.744 --> 01:33:36.743
Oh.

01:33:38.146 --> 01:33:39.846
-Oh.
-Oh, yeah, boy.

01:33:39.848 --> 01:33:41.715
-Thank you.
-Over here.

01:33:41.717 --> 01:33:44.951
Fill me with baby juice.

01:33:44.953 --> 01:33:45.952
-Whoo!
-Do it!

01:34:00.401 --> 01:34:03.737
-Do you wanna flip around,
or something?
-What?

01:34:03.739 --> 01:34:05.372
Sorta go where like
we can't look at each other,

01:34:05.374 --> 01:34:06.906
just to be fun,
just to switch it up.

01:34:06.908 --> 01:34:08.942
-No, no, no.
This is perfect.
-Okay.

01:34:08.944 --> 01:34:09.943
Just like that.

01:34:09.945 --> 01:34:12.979
-Yeah.
-Oh, my god.

01:34:12.981 --> 01:34:15.148
-Yeah.
-What are you doing?

01:34:15.150 --> 01:34:16.216
-Adam?
-Hmm?

01:34:16.218 --> 01:34:18.051
-Hey.
-Hmm?

01:34:18.053 --> 01:34:19.386
Look at me.

01:34:19.388 --> 01:34:21.855
Everybody looks weird
when they come.

01:34:21.857 --> 01:34:25.792
-Just look weird with me.
Okay?
-Okay.

01:35:30.091 --> 01:35:34.928
-Chester?
-Yeah?

01:35:34.930 --> 01:35:38.098
Please don't put your penis
inside of anybody else.

01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:39.866
Can we play
video games now?

01:35:39.868 --> 01:35:41.935
-Yeah, let's play
video games now.
-Okay.

01:35:51.446 --> 01:35:54.047
That, um...

01:35:54.049 --> 01:35:57.050
That went a lot better
then in high school.

01:35:57.052 --> 01:35:58.418
Yeah.

01:36:00.421 --> 01:36:02.422
And nobody had to run
down the street

01:36:02.424 --> 01:36:03.957
without any clothes on.

01:36:03.959 --> 01:36:06.426
Yeah.

01:36:08.429 --> 01:36:09.963
It's okay.

01:36:11.165 --> 01:36:12.766
I'm over it.

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:24.043
Adam?

01:36:32.052 --> 01:36:35.188
Adam,
everyone can see you.

01:36:37.291 --> 01:36:38.992
What are you doing?

01:36:38.994 --> 01:36:41.427
Something I should have done
12 years ago.

01:37:33.348 --> 01:37:36.282
-Come on.
-Whoo! It's so cold.
