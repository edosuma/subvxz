00:10.385 --> 00:11.803
First, you need to know...

00:12.053 --> 00:14.305
it is a cartel.

00:18.560 --> 00:19.936
<i>Or we say it's like...</i>

00:20.770 --> 00:22.063
a communist regime.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.067
Or a regime of terror.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.946
<i>Or a bit like the mafia.</i>

00:32.991 --> 00:34.701
<i>No one can stop...</i>

00:34.784 --> 00:37.454
<i>the Federation of Maple Syrup Producers.</i>

00:48.715 --> 00:50.341
<i>They took all my syrup.</i>

00:54.262 --> 00:57.015
<i>They started taking our right to speak.</i>

01:01.728 --> 01:03.938
<i>The Federation owes us a lot of money.</i>

01:10.862 --> 01:13.615
<i>They will turn us all into criminals.</i>

03:44.891 --> 03:48.186
<i>The Federation has labeled me</i>
<i>a "rebel of the system."</i>

03:48.269 --> 03:50.021
Yes, I rebel.

03:51.147 --> 03:54.817
<i>I fight so producers can regain</i>
<i>their freedom from this mafia.</i>

06:12.997 --> 06:17.752
<i>While we were inspecting the barrels,</i>
<i>we noticed one had a ring of rust.</i>

06:19.796 --> 06:21.672
<i>Syrup does not sweat.</i>

06:23.716 --> 06:24.717
<i>Even if it's cold,</i>

06:24.801 --> 06:27.261
<i>it's not like a glass of water</i>
<i>that leaves a ring on the table.</i>

06:28.679 --> 06:30.348
<i>We started opening barrels.</i>

06:33.017 --> 06:34.977
<i>They were filled with water.</i>

07:54.932 --> 07:57.143
I've told everything to my lawyer
and the investigators,

07:57.226 --> 07:58.728
so I've got nothing to say.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.147
<i>I've always had a dream</i>
<i>that my husband and I</i>

10:06.230 --> 10:11.777
<i>would be able to retire peacefully</i>
<i>in our own sugar bush.</i>

10:16.741 --> 10:22.038
<i>When I started with syrup production,</i>
<i>the Federation already existed.</i>

10:24.290 --> 10:27.835
<i>Until 2000, I didn't have any issues.</i>

10:30.004 --> 10:35.509
Then the Federation prepared
to take power.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.905
<i>The Federation started</i>
<i>an exclusive selling agency</i>

10:56.489 --> 10:59.867
<i>so that we can't sell elsewhere.</i>

11:01.869 --> 11:03.996
<i>It is written</i>
<i>in the Federation's regulations,</i>

11:04.080 --> 11:07.500
<i>the sap that runs in my maple trees</i>
<i>belongs to them.</i>

11:15.007 --> 11:21.138
<i>I can tell you that up to 90% of producers</i>
<i>were against the new system.</i>

11:23.182 --> 11:25.017
<i>We knew we were losing our freedom.</i>

11:28.229 --> 11:30.731
<i>So there was nothing to stop me</i>
<i>from fighting.</i>

11:42.201 --> 11:44.120
<i>It's a fight for everyone</i>

11:45.746 --> 11:48.958
<i>to have the right to sell</i>
<i>outside of the system of Québec.</i>

11:51.001 --> 11:53.337
It's the Federation or freedom.

13:19.131 --> 13:25.012
THE FARMERS ARE ORGANIZING

14:08.430 --> 14:10.599
It's harassment and intimidation.

14:10.683 --> 14:14.520
It's one legal battle after another.
I have a stack at my house.

14:14.603 --> 14:17.690
It's like I'm in purgatory.

16:29.321 --> 16:34.076
From the start,
I suspect that the Federation,

16:34.159 --> 16:38.497
when the time came to find a scapegoat,
they said, "That's Vallières for sure!"

16:38.580 --> 16:44.044
Because Vallières was probably
the most-known barrel roller in Québec.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.179
<i>On the black market,</i>

16:54.263 --> 16:58.726
the producers sell everything
that they produce over quota

16:58.809 --> 17:00.686
to barrel rollers,

17:01.979 --> 17:06.483
<i>who then resell to exporters.</i>

17:08.610 --> 17:10.738
<i>Well, it's illegal in the sense that</i>

17:10.821 --> 17:14.450
you have to be an authorized buyer
to buy and sell.

17:14.533 --> 17:18.704
<i>So you may be liable to a fine</i>
<i>of some sort.</i>

17:20.581 --> 17:24.626
<i>And my client had been fined</i>
<i>over a million dollars for selling syrup,</i>

17:25.335 --> 17:28.338
which, of course,
benefited the Federation.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.405
<i>I was the only one in New Brunswick</i>

18:35.489 --> 18:40.244
to start buying maple syrup
and exporting it in the US and Europe.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.087
<i>I was buying from big shots</i>
<i>like Richard Vallières,</i>

18:50.963 --> 18:54.550
<i>but I have small producers</i>
<i>who sell to me, too.</i>

18:59.388 --> 19:02.057
<i>One day, Angèle Grenier said,</i>
<i>"I can sell you syrup."</i>

19:02.891 --> 19:05.352
<i>She was frustrated with the Federation.</i>

19:05.435 --> 19:07.146
<i>I think they owed her a lot of money.</i>

19:10.065 --> 19:11.775
<i>The system in Québec,</i>

19:11.859 --> 19:13.235
<i>it's like...</i>

19:13.318 --> 19:14.695
a prostitute market.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.031
<i>The producers work very hard,</i>

19:18.907 --> 19:22.494
<i>but it's the Federation</i>
<i>that is paid very nice salaries.</i>

19:23.871 --> 19:24.872
Just like a pimp.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.681
<i>The Federation says it's a black market,</i>

19:43.390 --> 19:45.309
<i>but it isn't a black market.</i>

19:46.476 --> 19:50.272
I have a license from Ottawa,
and in Ottawa it's a free market.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.239
<i>I didn't sign any contract</i>
<i>with this syndicate,</i>

20:01.533 --> 20:03.327
<i>so I will fight until the end.</i>

20:16.298 --> 20:19.218
Okay, now you put it all at once.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.971
Okay. I'm going to stir it a little.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.264
Okay, Katrina.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.851
You'll see, it's going to turn into sugar.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.855
-A trio of three.
-A trio of three.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.944
<i>Since I didn't want to conform</i>
<i>to their regulations,</i>

20:38.403 --> 20:41.531
<i>they fined me $50,000.</i>

20:45.244 --> 20:47.621
<i>We had several lawyers at the beginning,</i>

20:48.789 --> 20:51.875
<i>but they only thought of</i>
<i>how much they could make.</i>

20:52.751 --> 20:57.631
But then we arrived at Hans Mercier,
and he really wanted to fight the battle.

23:34.996 --> 23:39.209
<i>The Federation's drivers always use</i>
<i>these specific forklifts,</i>

23:39.292 --> 23:44.089
<i>because they do not leave a mark.</i>

23:49.386 --> 23:52.222
<i>But the empty barrels we found</i>
<i>had marks on the sides.</i>

23:54.474 --> 23:57.561
<i>We could see</i>
<i>this was caused by a forklift.</i>

24:41.271 --> 24:42.606
I'm a journalist.

24:42.689 --> 24:46.318
And we're doing a story
investigating the Federation.

24:46.401 --> 24:50.614
And I wanted to speak with you
to get your side of the story.

27:16.384 --> 27:19.471
<i>It was a Sunday,</i>
<i>and I was working in the sugar bush.</i>

27:22.307 --> 27:27.645
And I realized that on the road
there was a car stopped.

27:31.274 --> 27:33.485
<i>I was being filmed.</i>

27:38.531 --> 27:41.618
<i>It was a private investigator</i>
<i>from the Federation.</i>

28:50.645 --> 28:56.025
You're going to wake up somewhere
and you're going to get straightened out.

29:03.533 --> 29:06.661
We want to break up this monopoly,
the UPA.

29:34.814 --> 29:37.192
A photo with Granddad.

30:43.550 --> 30:48.137
THE MAPLE SYRUP MAFIA HIT

30:48.221 --> 30:51.724
FEDERATION PRESIDENT'S SUGAR SHACK BURNS

30:51.808 --> 30:54.435
FIRE AT PIERRE LEMIEUX'S SUGAR SHACK

30:54.519 --> 30:57.105
FIRE
VANDALISM

30:57.188 --> 30:58.273
SYRUP WAS SPOILED

30:58.356 --> 31:02.610
CRIMINAL ORIGIN

37:13.314 --> 37:15.566
So you can just sit
in the back, Sébastien.

37:16.484 --> 37:19.695
Have you had any promises
or threats from anyone for doing this?

37:19.779 --> 37:22.114
-No promises.
-Okay.

37:22.198 --> 37:24.659
Obviously, they told me
it wouldn't hurt my cause,

37:24.742 --> 37:26.661
but no promises.

37:26.744 --> 37:30.206
That's a fact. It's called collaboration
in the investigation.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.168
<i>Avik Caron.</i>

37:34.252 --> 37:37.588
I knew people who sold syrup
because I was shipping syrup.

37:38.339 --> 37:42.176
So he told me,
"I have some syrup to sell."

37:42.260 --> 37:44.428
I didn't know where it came from.

37:44.512 --> 37:48.057
He asked, "Could you give me
your guy's number?"

37:49.850 --> 37:52.311
<i>So I gave him Richard Vallières' number.</i>

37:53.896 --> 37:55.898
<i>Then I saw the barrels.</i>

37:55.982 --> 37:57.984
One plus one equals two.

37:58.067 --> 37:59.777
I understood.

37:59.860 --> 38:01.946
Because they were making you deliver
syrup elsewhere?

38:02.947 --> 38:04.991
I understood what was going on.

38:46.490 --> 38:49.535
<i>They seized everything, all my syrup.</i>

38:50.119 --> 38:52.621
<i>Then they seized </i>
<i>all of the business documents.</i>

38:53.748 --> 38:56.125
<i>They closed my bank accounts.</i>

39:01.339 --> 39:03.257
They said I plotted, but I never plotted.

39:05.301 --> 39:08.596
Richard just called me
and he asked me if I wanted syrup.

39:09.138 --> 39:09.972
And I said yes.

39:16.395 --> 39:20.733
<i>The police told me </i>
<i>it was all regarding the theft,</i>

39:21.901 --> 39:25.154
<i>but it wasn't just for the theft.</i>
<i>I think it was to stop my business.</i>

39:30.201 --> 39:34.121
<i>The Federation doesn't like it</i>
<i>when anybody else does business.</i>

39:35.581 --> 39:38.709
<i>For them, it's all about</i>
<i>controlling the syrup. 100%.</i>

40:10.908 --> 40:15.329
<i>I followed the maple syrup heist </i>
<i>from beginning to end.</i>

40:17.123 --> 40:19.667
I've always wanted to support

40:19.750 --> 40:21.961
people who are in a situation
similar to mine,

40:22.044 --> 40:24.255
because I know how hard it is.

40:24.630 --> 40:26.257
And I understand them.

40:33.180 --> 40:40.104
<i>For Richard, I think this was his way</i>
<i>to protest against the Federation,</i>

40:41.397 --> 40:44.608
but I think maybe he got carried away.

40:47.278 --> 40:51.699
<i>There's fighting in the legal system, </i>
<i>like Angèle is doing,</i>

40:51.782 --> 40:54.493
and there's these guys that
want to fight in a different way.

40:56.996 --> 40:59.206
<i>But, I mean, it's the same fight.</i>

41:01.125 --> 41:03.961
<i>They are people not afraid</i>
<i>to fight the machine.</i>

42:05.773 --> 42:09.735
<i>What I can say about this </i>
<i>whole thing is that</i>

42:10.236 --> 42:14.865
<i>the Federation managed to turn</i>

42:15.574 --> 42:17.117
buyers into criminals.

42:21.789 --> 42:25.209
<i>Here in Québec, drugs are decriminalized,</i>

42:28.003 --> 42:31.006
<i>but they have criminalized maple syrup.</i>

42:34.093 --> 42:37.596
<i>Which is more dangerous for people?</i>

42:48.274 --> 42:53.445
<i>When you've known someone for 15 years,</i>
<i>you know that they are honest.</i>

42:53.529 --> 42:56.115
<i>They're just trying to make a living </i>
<i>with maple syrup.</i>

42:57.199 --> 43:00.578
<i>I find this very hard for Mr. St. Pierre.</i>

43:06.125 --> 43:10.879
<i>Like us, all he wanted to do </i>
<i>was retire peacefully.</i>

43:26.645 --> 43:32.401
<i>When all this started in 2002,</i>
<i>I was still hopeful for my retirement,</i>

43:32.484 --> 43:38.741
<i>because we thought</i>
<i>we would win in five to ten years,</i>

43:39.700 --> 43:41.368
<i>and then things would be sorted out.</i>

43:44.330 --> 43:47.374
But things didn't happen
the way we wanted them to happen.

43:51.587 --> 43:56.133
<i>Right now, as far as my retirement goes,</i>
<i>it is non-existent.</i>

47:31.974 --> 47:37.187
<i>I don't think too much about the future.</i>

47:37.271 --> 47:40.983
Because thinking about the future
makes me sick.

47:43.360 --> 47:45.612
<i>Why bankrupt people like this?</i>

47:47.239 --> 47:49.283
<i>Why not let us live?</i>

47:50.450 --> 47:52.953
<i>We are going to lose all of our freedom.</i>
