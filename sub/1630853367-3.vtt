WEBVTT

00:19.680 --> 00:20.680
Salute.

00:20.840 --> 00:22.000
-Alla notstra.
-Alla notstra.

00:24.880 --> 00:26.000
Mm.

00:55.560 --> 00:56.560
Sash.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.200
Hey.

02:54.160 --> 02:55.440
Salvatore.

02:58.040 --> 03:00.400
I know we agreed to be
flexible about working hours,

03:00.560 --> 03:02.120
but it's00 a.m.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.880
S-sorry.
This is my father, Gino.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.640
We need your help.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.560
It's, uh, papa's pig.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.040
She's missing.

03:21.640 --> 03:22.840
She's a pet?

03:23.000 --> 03:25.600
No. Uh...Mimi is a
very special pig.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.640
She earns more money

03:28.800 --> 03:30.960
than our entire
family put together.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.400
She is a truffle pig.

03:34.560 --> 03:35.400
Il migliore.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.120
That's right.

03:37.280 --> 03:41.120
And you think she's been stolen?
She couldn't just have escaped?

03:41.280 --> 03:42.800
-No.
-No. Impossible.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.880
Well then, you should
call the Carabinieri.

03:47.120 --> 03:53.600
Um, you see, Mimi doesn't
exactly pay tax on her earnings.

03:53.760 --> 03:58.160
And it is now illegal for people
to hunt for truffles with pigs.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.840
But, uh, it's
also very difficult

04:01.000 --> 04:04.120
for old men to change
their ways.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.560
Does your father
have any enemies?

04:08.720 --> 04:11.560
Anyone he's fallen
out with recently?

04:13.800 --> 04:15.560
No, no, no, no.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.280
He's friendly with everyone.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.880
Un momento, un momento.

04:38.360 --> 04:39.560
Mimi.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.080
Well, that's why the
Zampas need to go to the police.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.680
I know a stolen pig sounds
like something out

05:11.840 --> 05:13.320
of PG Wodehouse, Sylv, but...

05:13.480 --> 05:15.920
Shh. They made me promise
not to tell anyone.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.200
It's complicated.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.400
Everything in Panicale
is complicated.

05:22.520 --> 05:23.760
You're right about that.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.200
SignoraVolpe, buongiorno.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.280
Hello, Capitano.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.000
SignoraVitale.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.360
Are you buying your dinner, or
looking for truffle thieves?

05:33.520 --> 05:36.880
Huh. Truffle season
always brings trouble.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.800
Last year a truffle hunter
was robbed at gunpoint,

05:39.960 --> 05:42.520
and the thieves stole thousands
of Euros worth of stock. Uh...

05:49.120 --> 05:51.440
I'm sorry I didn't call you.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.200
I didn't call you either.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.280
-I wanted to call you, but...
-You don't need to explain.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.760
-Honestly.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.520
But you should probably
answer that.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.640
Answer it, Giovanni.

06:09.640 --> 06:12.840
Excuse me. It's my wife.
Excuse me, Sylvia.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.680
Everything alright?

06:19.360 --> 06:20.960
Uh, fine.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.520
You know, Matteo and I saw

06:22.680 --> 06:24.800
you two having dinner
the other night.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.800
-You never said.
-Hmm.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.440
That was three weeks ago.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.600
I was minding my own business.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.040
Anything happen?

06:32.200 --> 06:34.040
Girls, over here.

06:37.280 --> 06:40.640
Alonzo's truffles are
the best in the market.

06:40.800 --> 06:44.000
-Antonella, the best in Umbria.
-Maybe.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.440
Mmm.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.400
Mm.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.480
-Mm.
-They're earthy and dense.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.320
Like the forest floor.

06:57.480 --> 06:59.120
You have a good nose.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.840
Truffles are like diamonds.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.240
To find them, you must know not
only the right place to look,

07:04.400 --> 07:06.760
but the right day,
the right hour.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.560
Do you get any of your
truffles from Gino Zampa?

07:09.720 --> 07:11.720
His son is doing some
building work for me.

07:11.880 --> 07:14.320
Yeah, I did, years ago.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.480
Here. Try some of this.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.320
Grazie.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.840
Here, Antonella.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.800
Oh, God, that's good.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.560
Mmm.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.600
So, how much is that one?

07:27.760 --> 07:29.360
-This one. Okay.
-Mm-hm.

07:31.840 --> 07:35.560
To you, Signora...300 Euros.

07:35.720 --> 07:36.920
Are you joking?

07:37.080 --> 07:39.000
Alonzo never jokes about money.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.000
Well, what about the cheese?
Can I afford that?

07:43.160 --> 07:44.800
-For sure.
-Of course.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.240
Give her a nice piece.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.680
Yes.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.560
No wonder Gino
wants his pig back.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.040
It's Mimi's favorite song.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.720
It's the only thing that
works to calm her down.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.920
Is that your
father's only vehicle?

08:38.800 --> 08:41.680
Yes. I mean, with all the
money that Mimi makes for him

08:41.840 --> 08:44.640
he could afford a Maserati
but you know, old people.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.000
These come from
a four-wheel drive.

08:49.600 --> 08:50.840
Huh.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
-Papa.
-Huh?

08:58.520 --> 09:00.560
It's the plumber.
He came a couple of days ago

09:00.720 --> 09:02.200
to fix the taps.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.880
Maybe he took Mimi.

09:08.040 --> 09:13.520
Vito Pendenza? No, he's the most
honest man in Ginestra.

09:13.680 --> 09:16.560
Ginestra is the town on the
other side of the valley.

09:23.080 --> 09:26.120
That's right.
By Pendenza Plumbing.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.040
No, I-I don't mind holding.

09:38.920 --> 09:40.240
SignoraFox.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.040
Hello, Brigadiere.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.320
Do you need help?

09:43.480 --> 09:45.200
Oh, that's very kind of you,

09:45.360 --> 09:48.040
but the breakdown
company are on their way.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.720
Just let me have a look.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.600
I was gonna ask that guy
who's watching us for help,

09:57.760 --> 10:00.160
but he didn't seem
too keen to chat.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.360
Don't bother, signora.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.680
That's Giorgia Pendenza.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.880
He'd be dangerous
if he wasn't so stupid.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.680
We busted him not long ago

10:10.840 --> 10:13.080
for growing weed
in the woods near here.

10:15.480 --> 10:20.880
Well...that should work now.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.320
Your spark plug was loose.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.800
I only bought
the car last month.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.840
Thanks, Brigadiere.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.200
You're welcome.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.480
Hello, Sylvia.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.040
You bastard!

11:41.000 --> 11:43.720
So, I assume you're not here
for the truffle festival?

11:43.880 --> 11:45.400
Truffles, no.

11:45.560 --> 11:47.600
No, I'm in Rome
for a conference,

11:47.760 --> 11:51.040
so I thought I'd come up and see
how my ex-truffle was doing.

11:54.360 --> 11:55.800
Why are you really here?

11:57.200 --> 11:59.040
Do you remember
Dimitri Pavlenko?

12:00.440 --> 12:03.400
His son Sasha's studying
classics in Rome.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.880
He's just been arrested
on suspicion of murder.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.080
God. Dimitri will be devastated.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.760
Yeah.

12:09.920 --> 12:13.480
Mario Rizzo, fellow student
at Sapienza University.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.840
Found with blunt trauma
injuries in a park

12:16.000 --> 12:18.520
near the university
halls of residence.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.560
The night before Mario
was found dead,

12:20.720 --> 12:23.160
he and Sasha were
seen fighting in a bar.

12:23.320 --> 12:24.360
What about?

12:24.520 --> 12:25.680
Well, no one knows for sure,

12:25.840 --> 12:27.680
but they were
both close to a girl.

12:27.840 --> 12:29.880
Roberta Agosti.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.840
So why come to me?
I'm not a lawyer.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.920
Well, Dimitri's hired
half a dozen lawyers, but

12:36.080 --> 12:37.680
the boy won't
talk to any of them.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.120
Not a great look if you're
up on a murder charge.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.640
So, we just need to find someone

12:43.800 --> 12:46.320
who can find out
what's going on.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.760
And since you're on the
spot, Felicity thought--

12:47.920 --> 12:50.680
I'm on the spot because I don't
work for Felicity anymore.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.480
No one ever truly
leaves the service.

12:54.640 --> 12:55.920
You do know that, don't you?

12:56.080 --> 12:59.280
Sylvia?
I bought you some figs.

12:59.440 --> 13:03.000
We got masses... Adam.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.440
Hello, Isabel.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.480
It's been far too long.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.720
You didn't tell me
Adam was coming.

13:09.880 --> 13:13.320
Adam didn't tell me
that Adam was coming. Coffee?

13:13.480 --> 13:16.040
No, no, I can't. I've got a
couple of paintings to varnish.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.080
Isabel's having an exhibition
at the Palazzo Zucchetto.

13:19.240 --> 13:22.280
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

13:22.440 --> 13:23.200
You need to put these
in the fridge,

13:23.360 --> 13:24.480
so the ants don't get them.

13:24.640 --> 13:25.720
Thanks.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.680
What are you doing here?

13:31.840 --> 13:35.720
Well, it's not against the law
for a man to visit his ex-wife.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.320
Should be, in your case.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.000
Sorry. Why?

13:39.160 --> 13:41.880
Sylvia's happy and settled
for the first time in her life.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.480
You had your chance, mate.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.320
Now you need to leave her alone.

13:45.480 --> 13:46.920
Any progress on the pig?

13:47.080 --> 13:48.600
Uh, not yet.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.040
-Ciao. Ciao.
-Bye.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.160
-You're buying a pig?
-Not buying. Finding.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.760
Seriously, Sylvia?

13:59.920 --> 14:02.240
Two years ago you were
Station Chief in Beirut.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.880
I'm helping out a friend.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.840
Well, I'm a friend, aren't I?
Don't you wanna help me?

14:06.000 --> 14:07.160
Not particularly.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.920
Be at the fountain at
seven o'clock tonight...

14:12.080 --> 14:14.600
and by seven fifteen
I'll have changed your mind.

14:25.120 --> 14:26.280
Bollocks!

14:51.000 --> 14:52.560
Dimitri.

14:52.720 --> 14:56.160
Sylvia.
It's so good to see you.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.240
He's my only child.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.120
I know Sasha
isn't capable of murder.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.280
How can you be sure?

15:08.440 --> 15:09.800
Mm...

15:11.520 --> 15:16.400
He lacks necessary...
what's the word?

15:16.560 --> 15:18.080
Ruthlessness.

15:20.840 --> 15:24.280
Now he refuses to see me. He
won't even talk to the lawyers.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.800
What makes you think
he'd speak to me?

15:25.960 --> 15:28.520
It's not as if
we know each other.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.840
Everyone talks to you,
in the end.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.040
I can try.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.080
Thank you.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.640
Hello, Sasha.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.400
My name's Sylvia Fox.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.920
Are you another lawyer?

16:06.080 --> 16:10.240
I'm helping your legal team.
And you, I hope.

16:13.120 --> 16:14.520
There is nothing anyone can do.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.400
Tell me about Mario.

16:20.760 --> 16:23.200
You were both at
Sapienza University?

16:27.120 --> 16:29.960
Okay. Tell me about yourself.

16:30.120 --> 16:33.080
What made you decide
to come to Italy?

16:33.240 --> 16:35.720
I have nothing to say
to you or anyone else.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.800
You're gonna be tried
for murder with premeditation.

16:41.960 --> 16:45.040
If you're found guilty,
that's a life sentence.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.640
Sasha...

16:59.440 --> 17:00.840
Don't come back.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.760
That was quick. How was he?

17:23.920 --> 17:25.280
Rude. Frightened.

17:25.440 --> 17:26.720
-Guilty?
-I don't know.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.160
He wouldn't talk to me.

17:28.320 --> 17:32.120
-So, what's next?
-Nothing. I go home.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.520
He really didn't say anything?

17:33.680 --> 17:35.920
Adam, he said there was
nothing anyone could do,

17:36.080 --> 17:37.680
and he told me not to come back.

17:37.840 --> 17:38.960
And you're just gonna give up?

17:39.120 --> 17:40.520
Let some snotty kid succeed

17:40.680 --> 17:42.040
where hardened
terrorists have failed?

17:42.200 --> 17:44.320
Stop trying to manipulate me.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.640
It's for your own good.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.920
And mine.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.400
I need to be able to tell
Dimitri that we at least tried.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.240
Excuse me.
Is the student hall that way?

18:38.400 --> 18:39.960
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.560
-Yeah! Whoo!

20:24.000 --> 20:25.200
That looked like fun.

20:30.440 --> 20:31.760
Want a real race?

20:33.000 --> 20:34.240
You don't have a bike.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.320
How do you make that
thing go so fast?

21:28.480 --> 21:29.760
A trick I learned years ago.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.240
I don't have the cash
to pay you.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.600
How about payment in kind?

21:37.920 --> 21:39.000
I've got some questions.

21:48.520 --> 21:51.720
Sasha and Mario had a fight,
didn't they? Do you know why?

21:53.760 --> 21:55.000
Was it about you?

21:56.680 --> 21:59.200
I've seen the way you live.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.800
All packed in together, everyone
in each other's business.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.640
Must get stressful.

22:04.800 --> 22:05.960
Not really.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.320
Yeah, I had a thing with Mario.

22:09.480 --> 22:12.200
I had a thing with Mario,
I had a thing with Sasha.

22:12.360 --> 22:15.360
I had a thing with this cute
ragazza from my poli-sci class.

22:15.520 --> 22:16.840
-Sounds complicated.
-Mm.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.120
Sounds magnifico.

22:20.480 --> 22:23.800
Mario hid this in his room.
Any idea where he got it?

22:25.160 --> 22:26.520
No.

22:31.520 --> 22:34.240
This isn't the best deal
I've ever done.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.840
I won the race,
but you're the one

22:36.000 --> 22:37.600
walking away with 50 Euros.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.640
Mm-hmm.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.760
Come on, Roberta,
give me something.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.840
Mario had two phones.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.840
There you are.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.560
What, is someone joining us?

23:06.720 --> 23:10.160
-Hey, ciao, Sylvia.
-Ercole.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.560
Adam, this is Ercole Guerra.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.560
He used to work for
our Italian friends.

23:13.720 --> 23:16.800
Ercole, this is Adam Haines,
my former colleague.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.920
-Delighted.

23:19.080 --> 23:20.800
I'm told the truffles
here are very good.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.560
-Oh, well...
-Hm.

23:28.680 --> 23:30.800
Gracia.

23:30.960 --> 23:34.360
Mario Rizzo's family are known
to the authorities in Calabria.

23:34.520 --> 23:37.760
Petty thefts, VAT fraud,
that kind of thing.

23:37.920 --> 23:40.680
It's possible the apple
didn't fall far from the tree.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.440
He had two phones.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.520
Can you find out if the
police have both of them?

23:44.680 --> 23:46.280
It'd be good to know
what's on them.

23:47.800 --> 23:49.720
I know people at
the Commissariato.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.000
I'll ask around.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.120
Thanks.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.680
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.160
I'm just worried about
the boy being in custody.

23:58.960 --> 24:01.840
Rebibbia prison isn't
for the faint hearted.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.520
In Italy, you can
only detain a suspect

24:05.680 --> 24:08.680
before trial for very
specific reasons.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.800
If there is a
serious probability

24:10.960 --> 24:13.280
the suspect has
committed the crime.

24:13.440 --> 24:15.400
Well, the evidence
is all circumstantial.

24:15.560 --> 24:17.160
To prevent them
from committing

24:17.320 --> 24:20.200
another crime
or destroying evidence.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.880
None of these apply to Sasha.

24:23.040 --> 24:25.560
So, we get his lawyers
to appeal against the order

24:25.720 --> 24:27.960
before the Tribunale
della Libertà.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.680
Even if they think
he's a flight risk,

24:30.840 --> 24:33.720
the judge might allow him
freedom under house arrest.

24:34.480 --> 24:35.520
Whose house?

24:38.040 --> 24:40.640
Oh, no. I'm not a babysitter.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.240
My bathroom isn't even finished.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.920
Oh, come on, Sylvia.
The boy has got nowhere to go.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.680
He could help you
with the grouting.

24:50.160 --> 24:52.800
Has my father made you do this?

24:52.960 --> 24:57.800
No. Your lawyers managed to get
the detention order lifted.

24:57.960 --> 25:01.080
You can't leave the country,
but you can leave this place.

25:01.240 --> 25:02.760
And what if I don't want to?

25:04.200 --> 25:06.080
Then you're crazy.

25:06.240 --> 25:08.440
Imagine what it will
be like when your fellow inmates

25:08.600 --> 25:09.920
find out who your father is.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.480
I hate him.

25:15.040 --> 25:16.960
He has no idea who I am anymore.

25:19.480 --> 25:20.960
You don't have
to tell me anything.

25:22.440 --> 25:25.480
You don't even have to speak.

25:25.640 --> 25:27.880
But anywhere is better
than this place, isn't it?

25:33.120 --> 25:35.720
It's still a work-in-progress,

25:35.880 --> 25:38.040
but I finally have a
shower that works.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.160
Sort of.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.480
You'll be
sleeping in here.

26:08.480 --> 26:09.600
There's no bed.

26:10.760 --> 26:13.200
You can sleep on the sofa.

26:13.360 --> 26:16.320
I'll see if I can
rustle up some clothes for you.

26:16.480 --> 26:17.400
If you'd have let me
go back to campus,

26:17.560 --> 26:19.560
I could have packed properly.

26:19.720 --> 26:21.440
I'm not sure it would
be a good idea for you

26:21.600 --> 26:23.240
to show your face
there at the moment.

26:27.560 --> 26:29.320
Sorry, what did you say?

26:36.040 --> 26:37.680
He died because of me.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.200
I made you something to eat.

27:32.600 --> 27:33.840
Mm-hmm.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.200
I know
it sounds crazy.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.080
Trust me, it'll work.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.200
Okay.

27:40.360 --> 27:41.480
I'll try it.

29:24.760 --> 29:27.560
Sylvia,
what can I say?

29:27.720 --> 29:31.160
A huge thank you from Moscow.

29:31.320 --> 29:34.480
Some news.
The trial date has been set.

29:34.640 --> 29:39.120
We have two weeks to clear
his name and mine.

29:39.280 --> 29:42.120
Please,
he needs to talk.

29:52.680 --> 29:56.960
I, uh, can't find my phone.
Have you seen it?

29:57.120 --> 29:58.360
It's in the kitchen, charging.

29:59.200 --> 30:00.320
Coffee?

30:01.200 --> 30:03.120
Um, yes, please.

30:07.280 --> 30:08.840
Buongiorno, SignoraSylvia.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.040
Ah, buongiorno.

30:11.200 --> 30:14.360
This is Sasha. He's staying
with me for a few days.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.760
Salvatore and Luca are
helping me on the house.

30:16.920 --> 30:17.840
-Hey, Sasha.
-Hey.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.600
Er, scusi, signora.

30:19.760 --> 30:20.920
Any news on Mimi?

30:24.400 --> 30:26.720
Sorry, Salvatore. Nothing yet.

30:26.880 --> 30:29.280
Hmm. Grazie.

30:34.440 --> 30:35.960
Who's Mimi?

30:36.120 --> 30:40.360
I'll tell you later.
We're going for a walk.

30:40.520 --> 30:43.360
But I thought that
I was under house arrest?

30:43.520 --> 30:45.040
Well, who's gonna know?

30:45.200 --> 30:47.840
And I'm not leaving you here
to get in Salvatore's way.

31:05.320 --> 31:06.400
Come on.

31:12.720 --> 31:15.160
You're half my age.
You should be racing ahead.

31:17.240 --> 31:19.000
I don't do walking.

31:27.560 --> 31:30.280
That's a, a nice knife.

31:31.760 --> 31:34.720
-Looks old.
-Belonged to my father.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.400
It's the only thing
I have of his.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.200
He is dead?

31:41.680 --> 31:42.920
I don't know.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.680
I know that you
are not a lawyer.

31:48.840 --> 31:52.760
But you used to work
with my father, right?

31:52.920 --> 31:55.120
For my father.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.200
I used to work for the
British government.

31:57.360 --> 31:58.760
The Foreign Office.

31:58.920 --> 32:01.280
I helped organize
trade missions in Moscow.

32:06.600 --> 32:10.760
It's nice here. Wild.
Mm.

32:10.920 --> 32:13.200
I've never lived
in a village before.

32:13.360 --> 32:15.480
Everyone knows everyone
else's business.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Then you must work
harder to hide it.

32:25.480 --> 32:27.120
You really like
that jacket, don't you?

32:28.640 --> 32:31.440
Yes.

32:31.600 --> 32:34.320
You said that we're going
to find a pig. Come on.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.520
It's Mario's jacket, isn't it?

32:43.040 --> 32:44.200
Sasha!

32:46.280 --> 32:47.960
You hated each other.

32:48.120 --> 32:51.360
You had a fight right before
he died. Why wear his jacket?

32:53.280 --> 32:55.160
-Sasha!
-I didn't hate him!

32:58.840 --> 33:00.360
I didn't hate him.

33:09.400 --> 33:14.000
He was always there,
at the center of everything.

33:15.960 --> 33:18.000
Everyone loved him.

33:21.960 --> 33:23.680
And then one day, he kissed me.

33:28.880 --> 33:33.000
I freaked out. I punched him.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.960
And I felt awful.

33:42.560 --> 33:46.240
I went to his room
to apologize and then...

33:55.000 --> 34:00.880
Every day it was like whoosh.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.720
It felt like I was flying.

34:07.720 --> 34:09.160
You know what I mean?

34:11.160 --> 34:14.280
I think I did. Once.

34:16.600 --> 34:20.920
I made him promise not
to tell anyone about us.

34:21.080 --> 34:24.200
-If my father found out...
-He'd have disapproved?

34:24.360 --> 34:26.520
He disapproves
of everything I do.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.800
I didn't think
that it would last.

34:44.680 --> 34:47.000
I thought Mario would
get bored of me.

34:49.080 --> 34:50.400
But he didn't.

34:55.040 --> 34:56.440
I didn't kill him, Sylvia.

34:57.560 --> 34:59.160
You said he died because of you.

35:06.120 --> 35:07.560
Sasha.

35:12.920 --> 35:13.920
What is that?

35:34.200 --> 35:36.640
That's the life.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.760
If you like spending
your day in a cage.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.040
What now?

35:43.200 --> 35:44.160
We go home.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.960
We're not going to rescue Mimi?

35:48.120 --> 35:50.760
I don't think she'd fit
on the back seat, do you?

36:06.200 --> 36:08.840
Buongiorno.Sorry,
I know we're leaving early,

36:09.000 --> 36:10.680
but, uh, we got a call.

36:10.840 --> 36:12.800
Yeah, a ceiling fell down
at the agriturismo.

36:12.960 --> 36:16.320
Oh, it's okay. I've got
good news. We found Mimi.

36:16.480 --> 36:17.800
-Really?
-No!

36:17.960 --> 36:19.280
-Grande.
-Super.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.080
Thank you. I knew you would.

36:21.240 --> 36:24.120
I'm gonna send you the location
and the GPS reference.

36:24.280 --> 36:25.240
The rest is up to you.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.440
Grazie.

36:26.600 --> 36:27.960
-Thank you.
-Okay, thank you.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.280
-Hey.
-Hi.

36:46.440 --> 36:49.560
-Oh, is that for the show?
-Yeah. Last one.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.800
-It's not right.
-Looks right to me.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.880
-It's beautiful.
-No. No, no, no, no, no.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.440
Can I ask you a favor?

36:56.600 --> 36:59.040
I've got a young man staying
with me for a few days.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.160
-Oh.
-Son of an old friend.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.040
It was all a bit sudden.
Anyway, I've got to go out,

37:03.200 --> 37:04.560
not sure how long I'll be.

37:04.720 --> 37:06.680
So, could you call in
and just check he's okay?

37:06.840 --> 37:10.240
-Well, how young exactly is he?
-Mmm, 20.

37:10.400 --> 37:13.520
Twenty? What, he can't look
after himself for a few hours?

37:13.680 --> 37:14.880
Who exactly is this kid?

37:15.040 --> 37:16.960
He's called Sasha Pavlenko.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.880
Oh, this wouldn't have anything
to do with Adam, would it?

37:20.040 --> 37:22.640
Kind of. He's a student
at La Sapienza.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.080
Got himself into
a spot of bother,

37:24.240 --> 37:26.120
so he's taking some
time out at my place.

37:26.280 --> 37:27.920
A spot of bother, eh?

37:28.080 --> 37:29.600
That's what mum used
to say about dad

37:29.760 --> 37:32.160
when he wasn't gonna make it
back in time for our birthdays.

37:34.040 --> 37:37.800
He used to bring home unexpected
guests sometimes, too.

37:37.960 --> 37:38.800
What kind of guests?

37:38.960 --> 37:40.480
Oh, I don't know.

37:40.640 --> 37:41.480
Heard voices in
the night, and then

37:41.640 --> 37:43.160
they were gone in the morning.

37:43.320 --> 37:47.280
-I've ruined it.
-No, you haven't.

37:47.440 --> 37:50.840
-Anyway, can you help or not?
-No, I can't. Ask Alice.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.040
-She's here?
-Yeah. She got back yesterday.

37:54.200 --> 37:56.040
Her summer job fell through.

38:05.080 --> 38:06.480
Want to make yourself useful?

38:11.120 --> 38:12.440
Sasha?

38:14.720 --> 38:17.160
I have to go out for the day.
This is my niece, Alice.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.440
She's gonna keep you company.

38:19.600 --> 38:23.360
Stand guard, you mean?

38:23.520 --> 38:27.840
Uh, I thought you could tell her
all about Ovid's Metamorphoses.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.320
Oh. Well, it's, uh,
it's an amazing text.

38:30.480 --> 38:36.600
It's, uh, an epic
of female...experience.

38:36.760 --> 38:38.320
There's food in the fridge.

38:38.480 --> 38:41.680
Help yourself to anything you
want except the best whisky.

38:48.080 --> 38:49.880
Do you know which
is the best whisky?

38:52.040 --> 38:53.160
Oh, yeah.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.640
A lovers' quarrel?

38:58.800 --> 39:01.680
Mmm. Mario threatens
to expose the relationship,

39:01.840 --> 39:03.920
Sasha's terrified of his
father finding out,

39:04.080 --> 39:05.960
lashes out and kills him.

39:06.120 --> 39:08.600
It's what the prosecution
will argue, if they find out.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.640
That doesn't make it the truth.

39:10.800 --> 39:16.280
Sasha's overwhelmed with
grief, love, and yes, guilt.

39:16.440 --> 39:19.400
But I don't believe
that he killed Mario.

39:19.560 --> 39:23.880
What if the father did it?
Had it done, rather.

39:24.040 --> 39:25.960
Because of the political
fall-out at home,

39:26.120 --> 39:27.720
were it to become known
that his son was gay?

39:27.880 --> 39:29.560
It's a possibility.

39:29.720 --> 39:32.240
Come off it, Adam!
Dimitri wouldn't do that.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.440
But if he did, they'd
never have found the body.

39:34.600 --> 39:38.680
And his son wouldn't
be facing a murder charge.

39:38.840 --> 39:43.240
I'm sorry I haven't been able
to come up with any leads yet.

39:43.400 --> 39:46.200
I'm beginning to think
there aren't any.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.600
It's not looking great.
His trial's in two weeks

39:51.280 --> 39:54.200
I think we need to get him out,
back to Russia. Now.

39:54.360 --> 39:56.400
Well, he can't.
They've got his passport.

39:56.560 --> 39:59.760
And you've never left the
country without a passport?

39:59.920 --> 40:02.520
If Sasha runs, it will look
like an admission of guilt.

40:02.680 --> 40:04.960
And how's that gonna play out
for Dimitri back home?

40:06.200 --> 40:07.840
No.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.640
We hold our nerve.
We're gonna crack this.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.680
You think you're on
to something, don't you?

40:29.080 --> 40:30.800
What have you got?

40:30.960 --> 40:33.880
The Visa card has
two thousand Euros on it.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.600
-Wow.
-Yeah.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.880
"Elton John" paid for it.

40:38.040 --> 40:40.800
At least, that was the
name on the Amex card.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.520
I ran the number,
and it's only been used

40:43.680 --> 40:45.280
for one other purchase.

40:45.440 --> 40:49.560
-Which was?
-A payment to DWX Holdings.

40:49.720 --> 40:51.360
Sounds like a shell company.

40:51.520 --> 40:53.840
It is, based in Singapore.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.880
But it also owns an
app called BabboBear.

41:01.880 --> 41:04.920
Looks like something for kids,
but I'm guessing it's not.

41:05.080 --> 41:07.960
Right. It's a
"sugar daddy" website.

41:08.120 --> 41:11.640
Rich old men pay hot young
things to go places with them.

41:12.680 --> 41:14.760
Hot young things like Mario?

41:14.920 --> 41:16.760
His profile's there.

41:16.920 --> 41:19.720
I tried to get into
the customer list,

41:19.880 --> 41:23.640
but the encryption on the site
is better than the Pentagon's.

41:48.440 --> 41:49.440
Grazia.

42:26.840 --> 42:29.680
For my ex. He's a very sad
and lonely man.

42:30.760 --> 42:31.800
Ah.

42:45.800 --> 42:48.720
There is some cheese
with grey bits in.

42:50.040 --> 42:53.800
Ham. Lettuce.
It's not very inspiring.

42:53.960 --> 42:56.160
Shall we go get pizza?

42:56.320 --> 42:59.600
-I'm not allowed.
-Not allowed pizza?

43:02.120 --> 43:03.680
I was in prison in Rome.

43:05.800 --> 43:11.520
Your aunt got me out, but I'm
meant to be under house arrest.

43:12.760 --> 43:13.920
What did you do?

43:15.960 --> 43:17.240
Nothing.

43:17.400 --> 43:19.200
Okay. Well, what did
they arrest you for?

43:28.120 --> 43:30.320
They think I murdered
the man I loved.

43:35.160 --> 43:37.120
Well, the man I
love is in prison

43:39.120 --> 43:40.680
for killing his girlfriend.

43:51.800 --> 43:52.760
Don't worry.

43:54.120 --> 43:56.800
This is only the second best.

45:01.200 --> 45:02.680
-Ah, excuse me.
-Yes.

45:02.840 --> 45:04.240
This is for Roberta Agosti.

45:04.400 --> 45:05.440
Do you know which floor
she lives on?

45:05.600 --> 45:06.640
Yes. The second floor.

45:06.800 --> 45:07.920
Grazie.

45:44.240 --> 45:45.920
-Roberta.

45:46.080 --> 45:47.560
I'm not gonna hurt you.

45:47.720 --> 45:50.720
I'm Sylvia, remember?
I'm working for Sasha's father.

45:51.720 --> 45:53.040
Are you okay?

45:55.480 --> 45:56.800
What happened here?

46:00.520 --> 46:01.800
I don't know.

46:05.080 --> 46:07.520
I came home and I
found it like this.

46:17.280 --> 46:19.000
It was Mario's idea.

46:21.320 --> 46:25.120
We'd use the sugar daddy money
to live like movie stars.

46:25.280 --> 46:26.920
At least for a few months.

46:30.800 --> 46:32.840
This is the first time
I've been back here.

46:36.800 --> 46:38.720
Neither of us came from money.

46:41.760 --> 46:44.880
All of this, it was, um,
a fantasy, a dream.

46:47.840 --> 46:48.960
Now he's gone.

46:50.520 --> 46:52.120
Did Sasha ever come here?

46:53.760 --> 46:56.720
We had a rule.
No one from the outside.

46:56.880 --> 46:58.760
What about your
BabboBear clients?

47:00.240 --> 47:04.400
No one. It's our place,
our home.

47:06.360 --> 47:07.960
Tell me about Mario's clients.

47:11.520 --> 47:15.600
Older men, mostly.
Um, a few women.

47:17.440 --> 47:19.840
He didn't mind as long as
they were rich.

47:24.080 --> 47:26.000
Do you think one of them
could have killed him?

47:31.000 --> 47:33.360
Six months ago,
Mario suddenly had more money.

47:33.520 --> 47:37.680
And he paid for my share of
the rent, didn't want it back.

47:37.840 --> 47:43.080
Um, said he had a new client,
who was very generous.

47:43.240 --> 47:48.800
Did he tell you anything about
him? Age? What he was like?

47:48.960 --> 47:52.240
It was a man. That's all I know.

47:52.400 --> 47:55.600
We never talked about that side
of things. It's just work.

47:57.240 --> 47:59.480
Any idea what he could
have been looking for?

48:03.000 --> 48:07.360
Roberta, Mario's dead, and the
person who killed him

48:07.520 --> 48:08.840
knows about this place.

49:28.480 --> 49:31.440
Mario used to bring these back
from his dates,

49:31.600 --> 49:33.440
the really expensive bottles.

49:36.480 --> 49:37.880
What are you doing?

49:45.840 --> 49:47.040
Saluti!

49:58.680 --> 50:00.360
Sasha.

50:00.520 --> 50:01.640
-Sasha.
-Hm?

50:01.800 --> 50:03.280
I need to
show you something.

50:18.640 --> 50:22.480
This belonged to Mario.
Have you ever seen it before?

50:23.560 --> 50:24.480
No.

50:51.720 --> 50:53.880
Who took this?

50:54.040 --> 50:58.440
Mario. He must have
had a camera hidden in his room.

50:58.600 --> 51:01.080
No, he didn't.
He wouldn't have.

51:03.360 --> 51:05.600
It's time stamped end of March.

51:07.080 --> 51:08.320
Was that when you got together?

51:13.760 --> 51:15.680
I think one of Mario's clients

51:15.840 --> 51:19.720
was paying Mario to film
the two of you.

51:19.880 --> 51:21.440
Why? For kicks?

51:22.880 --> 51:26.880
To hurt your father.
He's a progressive.

51:27.040 --> 51:29.200
The hardliners back home
want him out.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.200
Has he seen this?

51:34.440 --> 51:35.600
I don't think so.

51:38.080 --> 51:40.480
Did you know about BabboBear?

51:40.640 --> 51:45.000
I-I knew that, uh,

51:45.160 --> 51:47.280
that Mario would often go
out at night,

51:47.440 --> 51:51.280
and that he was
never short of money.

51:54.040 --> 51:55.760
But I never asked questions.

52:02.760 --> 52:05.960
He was being paid to be with me.

52:07.800 --> 52:10.760
You didn't suspect anything?

52:10.920 --> 52:13.600
It doesn't make sense.
It doesn't.

52:13.760 --> 52:15.760
None of it makes
any fucking sense.

52:17.440 --> 52:19.720
Why would they want me
to post the picture,

52:19.880 --> 52:22.640
if all the time he was
filming us for someone else?

52:22.800 --> 52:23.800
What picture?

52:26.000 --> 52:30.520
The two of us kissing. He wanted
me to post it on social media.

52:30.680 --> 52:32.640
I thought you agreed to keep
the relationship secret?

52:32.800 --> 52:36.520
Yes, yes, of course, but a
couple of days before,

52:36.680 --> 52:41.000
before he died, he started
bugging me and saying,

52:41.160 --> 52:43.320
"Sash, come on, do it for me."

52:43.480 --> 52:46.000
He says that if I love him
enough that I would do it.

52:49.400 --> 52:51.880
He never liked to be told no.

52:54.560 --> 52:58.760
He would go crazy,
he would do stupid things.

52:58.920 --> 53:00.160
Say stupid things.

53:01.760 --> 53:04.440
You think that's what happened
after the club?

53:04.600 --> 53:06.880
He said stupid things
to the wrong people?

53:13.040 --> 53:15.680
You're right,
it doesn't make sense.

53:17.280 --> 53:20.400
Why post the photo,
but keep the filming secret?

53:35.080 --> 53:36.800
What were you doing in Moscow?

53:38.880 --> 53:40.880
I told you, I worked
for the Foreign Office.

53:41.040 --> 53:43.800
I organized visits,
trade fairs, stuff like that.

53:43.960 --> 53:45.800
How did you get to
know my father?

53:45.960 --> 53:47.960
He was Minister
for Foreign Trade.

53:49.720 --> 53:55.240
And what, fifteen years later,
he, uh, remembers you,

53:55.400 --> 54:00.360
finds where you are in Italy,
and asks you to help me?

54:00.520 --> 54:02.960
Like I said, we were friends.

54:03.120 --> 54:04.200
Just friends?

54:10.360 --> 54:13.200
You know, my mother,
she never said her name.

54:16.960 --> 54:19.400
But she said

54:19.560 --> 54:24.040
she left
because of another woman.

54:27.560 --> 54:29.200
It was you, wasn't it?

54:32.360 --> 54:37.360
Sasha, your father
was a charismatic man.

54:38.960 --> 54:41.280
I don't think I was
the only woman.

55:48.560 --> 55:50.080
It's truffle chocolate.

55:50.240 --> 55:54.360
My cousin in Perugia makes it.
It's pretty good.

55:58.040 --> 55:59.000
Thank you.

56:03.520 --> 56:05.840
Mmm, they're delicious.

56:08.680 --> 56:11.560
Well, I-I wanted to apologize
for the other day.

56:12.840 --> 56:15.040
I should have said
I was married.

56:15.200 --> 56:16.680
Yes, you should have.

56:24.080 --> 56:25.960
My wife wants a divorce.

56:29.640 --> 56:30.440
I see.

56:33.560 --> 56:34.840
And what about you?

56:36.800 --> 56:41.040
It's time. Our-our marriage,
it was over years ago.

56:42.680 --> 56:45.320
Long before I came to Perugia.

56:45.480 --> 56:47.360
You know, it's no one's fault,
but my work,

56:47.520 --> 56:49.600
it's hard on relationships.

56:49.760 --> 56:52.400
I think that might be
something that you understand.

56:55.600 --> 56:58.720
So, how's the truffle war?
Are you winning?

57:01.280 --> 57:05.000
Well, we arrested six dealers
today for trying to pass off

57:05.160 --> 57:07.480
Croatian truffles for Umbrian.

57:07.640 --> 57:09.200
What's the difference?

57:09.360 --> 57:11.240
About two thousand Euros a kilo.

57:11.400 --> 57:16.720
Wow! Do people still use pigs
to hunt for truffles?

57:16.880 --> 57:19.000
No, it's been illegal
since 1985,

57:19.160 --> 57:20.560
but some prefer the old ways.

57:22.040 --> 57:23.520
There are worse crimes.

57:30.920 --> 57:32.000
I think I should go.

57:37.200 --> 57:41.640
Uh, I didn't realize
you had a guest.

57:41.800 --> 57:45.440
Oh, that's Sasha.
He's the son of an old friend.

57:45.600 --> 57:47.680
He's studying in Rome,
needed a break.

57:49.080 --> 57:50.040
Ah.

57:53.080 --> 57:55.000
It's good to see you.

58:03.280 --> 58:04.320
Buona notte.

58:22.080 --> 58:23.040
What's up?

58:24.440 --> 58:27.800
Mimi wasn't there.

58:27.960 --> 58:29.200
-What?
-Mmm.

58:30.920 --> 58:34.320
We went to the place you showed
us, but she wasn't there.

58:34.480 --> 58:35.920
Well, perhaps she's been
taken into the woods

58:36.080 --> 58:37.480
to look for truffles.

58:37.640 --> 58:41.720
I don't know. We went there with
Luca early, it was dawn.

58:41.880 --> 58:44.400
We waited for hours,
but no Mimi.

58:44.560 --> 58:47.320
She must have been moved.

58:47.480 --> 58:49.760
I'm sorry, Salvatore.

58:49.920 --> 58:52.000
I don't think there's
anything else I can do.

59:03.840 --> 59:06.680
Well, it looks as if you were
right. Sasha didn't kill Mario.

59:08.600 --> 59:10.400
Unless, of course, he did,
and Dimitri had

59:10.560 --> 59:12.280
his guys go over the apartment.

59:12.440 --> 59:14.840
You're clutching
at straws, Adam.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
It's like you want Sasha
to be guilty.

59:19.120 --> 59:20.720
Just covering all the bases.

59:20.880 --> 59:21.920
Look, I don't understand what

59:22.080 --> 59:24.120
they would have been
looking for.

59:24.280 --> 59:26.320
Well, the film, surely.

59:26.480 --> 59:29.200
But Mario had been filming
for months, and he was passing

59:29.360 --> 59:31.560
the images on to his client
as he went along.

59:32.920 --> 59:34.680
There must have been
something else.

59:34.840 --> 59:36.640
Evidence that could
identify them?

59:37.800 --> 59:39.440
Maybe.

59:39.600 --> 59:41.840
It doesn't actually change
anything, you know.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.520
It strengthens the case
against Sasha.

59:43.680 --> 59:44.920
He could have killed Mario
because he found out

59:45.080 --> 59:46.240
he was being honeytrapped.

59:46.400 --> 59:47.720
No, I watched him watching
the footage.

59:47.880 --> 59:49.360
He was seeing it
for the first time.

59:49.520 --> 59:53.680
And I believe you, but it won't
carry any weight in court.

59:55.840 --> 59:58.200
It's time to admit defeat,
Sylvia.

59:58.360 --> 59:59.600
Let's get Sasha
out of the country.

59:59.760 --> 1:00:01.480
No way.

1:00:01.640 --> 1:00:05.400
Shouldn't you at least give him
the choice? Trial's in a week.

1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:12.000
Too much sun is bad for you,
you know.

1:00:14.320 --> 1:00:16.120
Mmm.

1:00:16.280 --> 1:00:18.040
-So is too much whisky.
-Mm-hmm.

1:00:18.200 --> 1:00:20.640
Especially the inferior kind.

1:00:20.800 --> 1:00:23.600
I go back to London in a month,
so, I'm just trying to soak up

1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:25.760
as much sunshine as
I possibly can.

1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:29.080
Fair enough.
Thanks for yesterday.

1:00:30.280 --> 1:00:31.440
Seriously.

1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:34.520
No, it was, um...
it was interesting.

1:00:34.680 --> 1:00:36.680
And before you ask, I haven't
told mum that you had me

1:00:36.840 --> 1:00:38.320
babysitting a murder suspect.

1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:46.040
Do you think David Hockney
has to do this?

1:00:46.200 --> 1:00:48.400
I think he probably does.

1:00:48.560 --> 1:00:50.760
With his special van maybe.

1:00:50.920 --> 1:00:52.040
How's the Russian infant?

1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:53.800
Still sleeping off his hangover?

1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:55.840
Sorry for leading
your daughter astray.

1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:57.960
More likely she led him astray.

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:01.920
Do you fancy coming with me?

1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:04.400
I might need a hand
at the other end.

1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:06.080
Sure.

1:01:08.240 --> 1:01:10.280
Hold on. It's Sasha.

1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:13.800
Oh. Probably wants his dinner.

1:01:13.960 --> 1:01:16.160
Or maybe he's located
your missing pig.

1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:19.360
Hi, Sasha.

1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:21.560
Someone is
watching the house.

1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:23.520
-Really?
-I am certain.

1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:27.680
Sorry. I've gotta go.

1:01:50.760 --> 1:01:55.120
There was someone there.
I'm telling you. Watching.

1:01:55.280 --> 1:02:00.360
I believe you. But it could have
been a hiker, or a birdwatcher.

1:02:01.640 --> 1:02:03.200
Ice-cream?

1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:04.600
What flavor?

1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:05.480
Pistachio.

1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:09.480
Hmm. It's my dad's favorite.

1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:11.520
Lots of people like pistachio.

1:02:12.840 --> 1:02:13.880
No, they don't.

1:02:33.320 --> 1:02:34.840
It's possible that
you might be able to

1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:38.520
leave the country, go home.

1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:43.440
Is this my dad's idea?

1:02:43.600 --> 1:02:46.600
Never mind whose idea it was.
It can be done.

1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:50.080
Couldn't they make me come back?

1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:53.920
No. Russia doesn't allow its
citizens to be extradited.

1:02:56.560 --> 1:02:59.080
But then I could be
stuck there forever.

1:03:00.520 --> 1:03:03.240
And everyone would think
that I was guilty.

1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:06.240
Yes. But you
wouldn't be in jail.

1:03:08.080 --> 1:03:09.920
What do you think
that I should do?

1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:13.120
It has to be your decision.

1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:18.720
Sasha. Wake up.
We've gotta get out of here now.

1:04:18.880 --> 1:04:19.920
-We need to get out.
-What?

1:04:21.400 --> 1:04:22.400
Okay.

1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:25.440
-Come on.
-Oh...

1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:39.200
Did you get a good look at him?

1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:40.320
No.

1:04:41.960 --> 1:04:43.480
Where are we going?

1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:45.920
A place near here
where I keep water and a phone.

1:04:46.080 --> 1:04:47.680
We can call the Carabinieri.

1:04:57.280 --> 1:04:58.240
Shit.

1:05:03.120 --> 1:05:04.320
Ahh!

1:05:28.360 --> 1:05:29.480
Ercole!

1:05:30.720 --> 1:05:31.920
No.

1:05:45.360 --> 1:05:47.000
They paid me well.

1:05:47.160 --> 1:05:49.000
You betrayed me, Ercole.

1:05:51.200 --> 1:05:53.120
You shouldn't have told me
about the second phone.

1:06:21.480 --> 1:06:23.680
Just the son of
an old friend, huh?

1:06:25.520 --> 1:06:31.200
Sylvia, Ercole had a Glock 17.
You could have been killed.

1:06:31.360 --> 1:06:33.040
But I wasn't, was I?

1:07:29.360 --> 1:07:32.240
That's the image
he wanted me to post.

1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:05.440
Who is the other guy?

1:08:05.600 --> 1:08:07.640
Viktor Golubev,
I think.

1:08:07.800 --> 1:08:10.400
Military attache at the
Russian Embassy in Rome.

1:08:21.920 --> 1:08:24.720
This was taken
two days before Mario died.

1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:29.400
It's what got him killed.

1:08:32.760 --> 1:08:36.000
Why did he do it?
Why did he confront him?

1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:39.920
Ercole must have hired Mario to
start a relationship with you,

1:08:40.080 --> 1:08:41.360
and film you together.

1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:45.000
But then Mario changed his mind.

1:08:46.760 --> 1:08:48.400
I think that's why
he wanted you to post

1:08:48.560 --> 1:08:50.320
a picture of the two of you.

1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:52.680
So that nobody could
use his footage

1:08:52.840 --> 1:08:55.120
to blackmail you or your father.

1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:59.160
But why didn't Mario
post the picture himself?

1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:03.400
Because then you might have left
him, and he didn't want that.

1:09:05.960 --> 1:09:08.080
So he needed another
way out of the deal.

1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:13.760
He followed Ercole
and filmed him meeting

1:09:13.920 --> 1:09:16.640
his Russian paymaster.

1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:19.240
Ercole saw him
but Mario got away.

1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:23.400
Got rid of his phone and hid
the SD card in his jacket.

1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:26.960
He gave me the jacket.
Wanted me to keep it.

1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:31.920
Ercole finally caught up
with him at the park,

1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:34.000
after your argument at the club.

1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:38.640
He killed him
and took his phone.

1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:43.080
But it was the wrong phone.

1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:49.520
There's another video file.

1:09:55.680 --> 1:09:56.800
Hey, world.

1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:00.440
I've screwed up...

1:10:02.080 --> 1:10:05.520
and I-I don't know
how this is going to end.

1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:11.880
This is for you, Sasha.

1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:15.680
I'm happy.

1:10:17.320 --> 1:10:21.200
I never felt it before,
but I-I feel it with you.

1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:25.480
-I love you.

1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:51.200
Hey, world.

1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:52.840
I've screwed up...

1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:57.120
and I-I don't know
how this is going to end.

1:10:58.640 --> 1:11:01.040
This is for you, Sasha.

1:11:04.520 --> 1:11:06.480
I want my father to see Mario.

1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:11.880
I want him to know who I am.

1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:16.360
Then we should give him a call.

1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:33.400
This is for you, Sasha.
I'm happy.

1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:37.760
I never felt it before
but I-I feel it with you.

1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:09.080
I can't imagine Golubev
came up with it by himself.

1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:10.760
True.

1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:13.600
But if I bring him down,
I will definitely be

1:12:13.760 --> 1:12:15.600
sending a message to my enemies.

1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:21.040
Thank you, Sylvia.

1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:23.440
Glad I could help.
Sasha's a good kid.

1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:25.720
-He is, isn't he?
-Mmm.

1:12:25.880 --> 1:12:29.440
Goodbye, malen'kaya.

1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:31.800
Goodbye, minister.

1:12:44.760 --> 1:12:48.960
Give me a call when you're in
Rome? We could go for ice-cream.

1:12:49.120 --> 1:12:50.920
It's a date.

1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:13.280
Ecco qua, carissima.

1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:15.960
Ah.

1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:28.000
Signora, you're a
long way from home.

1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:30.320
-So is Mimi.
-Huh...

1:15:30.480 --> 1:15:33.560
What's the penalty
for stealing a pig in Italy?

1:15:33.720 --> 1:15:36.920
I didn't steal her. Those
thieving Pendenzas took her.

1:15:37.080 --> 1:15:39.840
And I heard they were about to
sell her, so, I grabbed

1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:41.240
my shotgun, I went over there,

1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:43.880
and asked them nicely
to give her back.

1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:45.680
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:47.360
Those guys,
they're from Ginestra.

1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:50.120
Me and Gino,
we're from Panicale.

1:15:50.280 --> 1:15:52.280
But Ginestra's only three
kilometers up the road.

1:15:52.440 --> 1:15:53.880
It is Panicale.

1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:55.720
Never.

1:15:55.880 --> 1:15:58.000
Me and Gino, we grew up in the
same town.

1:15:58.160 --> 1:15:59.920
We went to the same school.

1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:03.080
And that's why I risked my life
to save his pig.

1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:06.040
So why haven't you
given her back?

1:16:06.200 --> 1:16:07.600
Signora, I was about to
give her back.

1:16:07.760 --> 1:16:10.240
I was, I-I wanted to give her
something to eat first,

1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:12.080
you know, give her
a chance to rest.

1:16:12.240 --> 1:16:14.400
Mimi didn't find a
single truffle

1:16:14.560 --> 1:16:16.480
for the Pendenzas, did she?

1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:19.920
She won't do anything
unless Gino sings to her.

1:16:20.080 --> 1:16:23.800
So they sold her to you,
in case you could do any better.

1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:26.320
Signora, how could you
say such a thing?

1:16:26.480 --> 1:16:28.080
Perhaps because it's true.

1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:31.480
But it doesn't matter, does it?

1:16:31.640 --> 1:16:34.040
As long as Gino gets
his pig back.

1:17:18.040 --> 1:17:19.920
Sylvia.

1:17:20.080 --> 1:17:22.360
-Adam.
-All's well that ends well.

1:17:22.520 --> 1:17:23.560
What are you doing here?

1:17:25.160 --> 1:17:27.560
And since when did you start
quoting Shakespeare?

1:17:27.720 --> 1:17:29.480
Well, I thought we'd celebrate.

1:17:29.640 --> 1:17:34.160
Oh, people are saying that
you found Gino Zampa's pig.

1:17:34.320 --> 1:17:36.160
A pig that was never
reported stolen.

1:17:36.320 --> 1:17:39.400
Well, you know
how people exaggerate.

1:17:39.560 --> 1:17:43.240
Hello. I'm Adam,
Sylvia's husband.

1:17:43.400 --> 1:17:44.480
Scusi?

1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:47.880
Ex-husband.
Adam is my ex-husband.

1:17:49.760 --> 1:17:52.320
Buongiorno, SignorFox.

1:17:52.480 --> 1:17:54.000
I'm Giovanni Riva.

1:17:54.160 --> 1:17:56.000
Capitano dei Carabinieri.

1:17:56.160 --> 1:17:57.280
-Delighted to meet you.
-Mm-hmm.

1:17:57.440 --> 1:17:59.640
Er, but it's not Fox.
It's Haines.

1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:03.000
-I kept my maiden name.
-Hm.

1:18:06.440 --> 1:18:08.120
Well, this, um, Millesimato

1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:09.600
isn't gonna drink itself,
Sylvia.

1:18:10.960 --> 1:18:12.960
Capitano, care to join us?

1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:17.000
Oh, thank you, but I must
get back to Perugia.

1:18:17.160 --> 1:18:20.120
Panicale, obviously,
can manage without me.

1:18:30.080 --> 1:18:31.400
He seems like a nice chap.

1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:42.280
To Sylvia...

1:18:44.440 --> 1:18:46.680
who always gets her man.

1:18:48.120 --> 1:18:50.280
I just wish the man
hadn't been Ercole.

1:18:54.920 --> 1:18:58.240
Why did you come to me
in the first place, Adam?

1:18:58.400 --> 1:19:01.040
Well, because I knew you'd do a
fantastic job, and you did.

1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:04.800
Sasha's free, Dimitri's safe.

1:19:04.960 --> 1:19:06.760
But he wouldn't have been
if I'd agreed

1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:09.040
to smuggle Sasha
out of the country.

1:19:09.200 --> 1:19:11.160
Word would have got around,
and Dimitri

1:19:11.320 --> 1:19:13.320
would have been out on his ear.

1:19:13.480 --> 1:19:14.720
That was a risk we had to take.

1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:17.120
A risk you pushed for,
very hard.

1:19:18.760 --> 1:19:20.320
I thought the
British government regarded

1:19:20.480 --> 1:19:21.760
Dimitri as a good thing?

1:19:21.920 --> 1:19:24.440
Well, let's just say,
that we decided it was

1:19:24.600 --> 1:19:26.160
time to hedge our bets.

1:19:29.680 --> 1:19:32.400
Because if we'd helped Sasha
escape without clearing

1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:37.880
his name, you'd win either way,
wouldn't you?

1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:39.920
Either Dimitri stays,
or he goes,

1:19:40.080 --> 1:19:42.720
and the service
has a hold over him.

1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:46.400
You were born for the service,
Sylvia. It's in your blood.

1:19:46.560 --> 1:19:48.960
What does that even mean?

1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:51.200
You know how the world works.

1:19:51.360 --> 1:19:52.960
You're one of the ones
who make it work.

1:19:53.120 --> 1:19:54.600
Did Felicity write that for you?

1:19:54.760 --> 1:19:59.320
No. But she wants you back.

1:20:04.720 --> 1:20:06.000
I want you back.

1:20:07.320 --> 1:20:10.760
Just leave, Adam. Now.

1:20:21.400 --> 1:20:23.120
We'll never let you go, Sylvia.

1:21:02.360 --> 1:21:04.280
Am I interrupting anything?

1:21:06.720 --> 1:21:08.240
No.

1:21:10.200 --> 1:21:11.280
Are you hungry?
