and I hatched a plan
to steal your tapes.

10:08.942 --> 10:09.910
What?

10:09.943 --> 10:12.279
I don't have
any Fionna and Cake tapes.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.781
I know!

If I met them,
I'd definitely record it.

They're just, like, a TV show
from the past or something.

You lied to me.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.606
Fionna would never lie --
never.

10:39.639 --> 10:43.110
Oh, glob, you're right.
I'm not like Fionna.
