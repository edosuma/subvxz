00:24.758 --> 00:27.898
<i>When warriors felt
threatened,</i>

00:27.927 --> 00:30.430
<i>they performed</i> a <i>ritual
asking for prosperity</i>

00:30.463 --> 00:33.000
<i>in exchange for human blood.</i>

00:33.033 --> 00:36.037
<i>This was so in the Mexico
of the Aztecs,</i>

00:36.069 --> 00:39.278
<i>and was so in the Mexico
of the Narcos.</i>

00:42.275 --> 00:46.621
<i>Rivers of blood were spilled
to please the gods.</i>

00:51.785 --> 00:55.892
<i>Many years ago,
when I started as a journalist,</i>

00:55.922 --> 00:58.402
<i>I witnessed brutality.</i>

00:59.459 --> 01:03.066
<i>What I saw does not
leave me alone.</i>

01:03.096 --> 01:05.872
<i>I was investigating
the disappearance</i>

01:05.899 --> 01:08.311
<i>of a group of youths.</i>

01:11.738 --> 01:14.048
<i>A colleague had put me in touch</i>

01:14.074 --> 01:17.817
<i>with a member of the Narcos
who was willing to talk.</i>

01:24.417 --> 01:26.727
<i>I went alone to the
appointment,</i>

01:26.753 --> 01:29.165
<i>at a mote! by the highway.</i>

01:55.515 --> 01:57.495
<i>It was him.</i>

02:25.712 --> 02:27.385
Spread your legs!

02:36.823 --> 02:37.801
What's this?

02:37.824 --> 02:39.360
It's to record the interview.

02:39.392 --> 02:42.532
Hey, hey,
that can't be done.

02:42.562 --> 02:43.973
I need it, man, to--

02:43.997 --> 02:49.913
No, no, what you need
is to stay alive, to write.

02:49.936 --> 02:54.316
You know what they're going
to do if they find this?

03:00.380 --> 03:03.156
Recording interviews,
you will not last long.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.169
Sit down.

03:13.293 --> 03:15.239
Sit the fuck down!

03:43.556 --> 03:44.864
I'm here because
I'm investigating

03:44.891 --> 03:48.338
the Moctezuma Bar case.

03:48.361 --> 03:51.035
Do you know something about it?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.771
Yes.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.010
I do. A lot.

03:58.938 --> 04:00.417
And I'm going to tell
you everything.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.750
Do you know why?

04:02.775 --> 04:05.085
'Cause I am fucked.

04:05.111 --> 04:07.284
'Cause they are going
to kill me.

04:07.313 --> 04:11.261
- Who?
- Who? What does it matter?

04:11.284 --> 04:13.787
At first there were Zetas.

04:13.820 --> 04:17.267
Arellano Felix,
Caballeros Templarios...

04:17.290 --> 04:19.702
But not now.
It's nothing like that.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.232
Did you hear that?

04:25.465 --> 04:28.241
They might be outside
waiting for me.

04:30.903 --> 04:33.383
on, shit!

04:46.986 --> 04:49.796
What happened at
the Moctezuma?

04:49.822 --> 04:54.965
The boss wanted a ritual,
so everything would go well.

04:54.994 --> 04:58.669
And then he called
the Eagle Knight.

04:58.698 --> 05:01.907
And that was when
everything went to hell.

06:23.783 --> 06:26.764
The god of the earth
opens his hungry mouth,

06:26.786 --> 06:31.201
to swallow the blood of many
who will die in this war.

06:31.224 --> 06:35.400
The sun and Tlantlecutli
want to celebrate.

06:35.428 --> 06:39.501
They want to give food and
drink to the gods of the sky,

06:39.532 --> 06:41.375
and the underworld,
to give them a treat,

06:41.401 --> 06:44.382
the flesh and blood
of those who have died.

07:28.047 --> 07:30.687
He told me how they kidnapped
a group of youths

07:30.716 --> 07:33.196
who were the children
of enemies,

07:33.219 --> 07:35.961
but ultimately innocent.

07:45.498 --> 07:49.275
Well, let's take a walk.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.632
Wait here.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.704
<i>The Aztecs made an
offering to their gods</i>

08:52.732 --> 08:56.111
<i>with the heads of their enemies.</i>

08:56.135 --> 08:57.546
<i>During the conquest,</i>

08:57.570 --> 08:59.948
<i>some Europeans
and even their horses</i>

08:59.972 --> 09:03.351
<i>ended up decapitated like this.</i>

09:06.145 --> 09:08.318
<i>Mexico.</i> . .

09:08.347 --> 09:11.123
<i>Terror is here...</i>

09:11.150 --> 09:13.357
<i>And now.</i>

10:55.554 --> 10:58.091
Where are we, José?

10:58.124 --> 11:00.229
<i>Jaral de Berrios.</i>

11:03.095 --> 11:04.699
This place is cursed.

11:04.730 --> 11:06.266
Don't worry.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.311
Those are just stories.

11:17.276 --> 11:19.586
That's the last of our water.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.458
Let me check.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.296
Move your hand.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.429
<i>Easy.</i>

11:31.290 --> 11:33.827
Once you see our loot,

11:33.859 --> 11:35.736
you'll forget about the pain.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.112
It's just a scratch.

11:49.442 --> 11:53.288
You'll have enough to buy
that horse you wanted...

11:55.548 --> 11:58.654
And the land by the river
to build your house.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.666
You could even steal...

12:08.694 --> 12:11.300
and marry...

12:11.330 --> 12:12.775
Odilun's sister.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.006
Don't tell me you don't
love her anymore.

12:20.005 --> 12:22.144
She loves you very much.

12:24.643 --> 12:26.486
You're going to be all right.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.655
Here's your hat.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.253
Wait here.

14:06.278 --> 14:07.916
I won't be long.

14:36.842 --> 14:38.583
Martin?

14:41.313 --> 14:42.986
Martin?

14:55.761 --> 14:57.434
Why didn't you answer?

14:57.463 --> 15:00.467
Let's get out of here, José.

15:00.499 --> 15:02.809
No one will find us here.

15:06.705 --> 15:09.345
I'll go look for a place
to spend the night.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.556
<i>Shh.</i>

17:20.271 --> 17:21.876
Ah!

17:33.952 --> 17:35.625
Martin!

17:44.296 --> 17:46.276
We have to go!

20:32.431 --> 20:34.843
Ah!

24:39.311 --> 24:41.257
Martin?

24:47.819 --> 24:49.924
Ah!

25:01.700 --> 25:03.805
Ah!

31:36.494 --> 31:39.907
Don't be afraid, bitch!

31:40.965 --> 31:43.809
I have a mission for you.

31:43.835 --> 31:48.614
You have to drain the blood
of your sister's vagina!

31:48.640 --> 31:51.314
If you can't accomplish this
in 12 hours,

31:51.342 --> 31:54.619
I will suck your soul
through your anus!

35:52.617 --> 35:53.960
Ah.

37:16.701 --> 37:19.739
DRAIN

37:57.608 --> 37:58.313
Hey, mama!

37:58.342 --> 38:02.381
Don't suck on that bottle,
suck on this!

38:02.413 --> 38:05.326
Don't go, mama!
Come here and make us wet.

38:08.986 --> 38:12.832
Mama, are you ready?
I'm gonna bang your brains out!

38:12.857 --> 38:14.131
Goodbye, babe!

38:14.292 --> 38:16.932
Dude! You gotta tell me
all the details.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.601
Of course, man!
You'll be the first to know.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.004
Let's go!

38:22.033 --> 38:24.240
- What's wrong?
- Start the fucking car!

38:26.203 --> 38:28.809
I was checking the GPS to see
if we were on the right road.

38:28.839 --> 38:30.546
I stayed here
to charge my phone.

38:30.574 --> 38:34.249
Look, Javier, don't
give me that bullshit!

38:34.278 --> 38:35.882
I hate when you lie to me!

38:35.913 --> 38:39.827
You stayed to chat
and I almost got raped!

38:39.850 --> 38:41.591
You don't know how
to protect me!

38:41.619 --> 38:43.997
Why did you even invite me?

38:44.021 --> 38:45.796
My mom was right.

38:45.823 --> 38:48.997
You're too irresponsible
to take care of me.

38:49.026 --> 38:51.734
Stop it, honey.
You're overreacting.

38:59.003 --> 39:02.109
I'm sorry for not having
gone with you, okay?

39:03.774 --> 39:05.947
I'll prove that your
mom is wrong.

39:05.976 --> 39:08.786
You'll have the best
night ever!

39:34.505 --> 39:37.714
Log Cabins

39:37.742 --> 39:40.348
You can choose any
of the ten cabins.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.654
They're all empty.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.956
Nobody comes on weekdays.

39:46.083 --> 39:47.653
Did you skip school or what?

39:47.685 --> 39:49.858
We want the furthest one,
please.

39:50.488 --> 39:52.695
That's the tenth
but like I said,

39:52.723 --> 39:54.703
there's no one here.

39:55.359 --> 39:56.861
It's quite private.

39:56.894 --> 39:58.874
The whole forest is yours.

40:13.110 --> 40:14.885
Honey!

40:17.248 --> 40:20.320
Javier, wait!
I want to talk first.

40:20.351 --> 40:24.595
It's not even dark yet and we
said this would be lovely.

40:24.622 --> 40:26.499
Yeah, you're right.
I'm sorry.

40:26.524 --> 40:27.696
Tell me, sweetheart.

40:27.725 --> 40:28.999
I was so mad before

40:29.026 --> 40:31.336
because I want everything
to be perfect today.

40:31.362 --> 40:33.239
Tomorrow I'll go back
a different person.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.868
I will never forget this night,

40:34.899 --> 40:37.903
and I'm so nervous
because I lied to my mom--

40:37.935 --> 40:40.006
Hey!
Shh. Shh.

40:40.771 --> 40:42.773
Everything's going well, right?

40:42.807 --> 40:45.788
You left school
after your last class,

40:45.810 --> 40:47.551
and there was no traffic.

40:47.578 --> 40:50.218
Damn!
Just look at this place.

40:50.247 --> 40:53.421
Damn!
Just look at those lips.

41:03.828 --> 41:05.569
Did you bring condoms?

41:05.596 --> 41:07.371
Of course.

41:27.251 --> 41:27.888
Yes?

41:27.918 --> 41:29.625
Are you alone?

41:29.653 --> 41:30.757
We are. Why?

41:30.788 --> 41:32.961
What are you doing here
on a Tuesday afternoon?

41:32.990 --> 41:34.936
There's been a mistake.

41:34.959 --> 41:37.439
The hotel is only open
on weekends.

41:37.461 --> 41:39.702
- You'll have to go
somewhere else--
- Fermin!

41:39.730 --> 41:41.937
You'll feel better in town,
with more people.

41:43.434 --> 41:45.641
- What?! Forget it!
We've already paid.
- Fermin!

41:45.669 --> 41:47.478
Don't bother the guests.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.451
Mind your business.

41:49.473 --> 41:50.918
I'm sorry, he's quite old.

41:50.941 --> 41:52.648
Close the windows at night!

41:52.676 --> 41:54.417
Don't leave anything outside!

41:54.445 --> 41:56.482
I told you not to host
people on weekdays.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.460
Yeah, whatever!

42:51.168 --> 42:53.512
No, wait!
Touch me more.

43:11.188 --> 43:12.690
Not now!

43:17.995 --> 43:20.134
Motherfucker!

43:21.865 --> 43:23.708
You left these sandals out.

43:23.734 --> 43:25.736
Please, don't leave
anything out, I'm serious.

43:25.769 --> 43:28.147
ls that why you knocked?
It's our patio!

43:28.172 --> 43:30.413
No,
the woods belong to others.

43:30.441 --> 43:31.818
They steal--

43:32.710 --> 43:33.814
Are you serious?

43:33.844 --> 43:35.016
Strawberry condoms?

43:35.045 --> 43:36.991
What's wrong, honey?
You'll like them, you'll see.

43:37.014 --> 43:38.425
What do you mean, asshole?

43:38.449 --> 43:40.725
I won't lose my virginity
with strawberry condoms!

43:40.751 --> 43:41.729
I can get infected!

43:41.752 --> 43:45.199
But honey,
that has nothing to do with it!

43:45.222 --> 43:47.031
Let me explain!

43:58.469 --> 43:59.209
Ah!

43:59.236 --> 44:00.772
There's a boy outside
spying on us!

44:00.804 --> 44:01.407
A boy?

44:01.438 --> 44:03.349
That's what I said!
He ran off!

44:03.374 --> 44:05.945
Leave us alone!

44:12.282 --> 44:16.230
No, don't open it!

44:19.056 --> 44:20.763
Ah!

44:20.791 --> 44:22.634
What's that?

44:22.660 --> 44:23.536
I'll go see.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.767
No!
Where are you going?

44:25.796 --> 44:28.470
Javier, don't leave me alone!

44:28.899 --> 44:30.606
Who's there?

44:42.446 --> 44:43.618
Javier?

44:43.647 --> 44:46.321
Javier,
don't leave me alone!

44:49.486 --> 44:51.090
Valeria?

44:56.760 --> 44:57.898
Javier!

44:57.928 --> 44:59.305
Open the door!

45:00.497 --> 45:02.306
Ah!

45:13.177 --> 45:15.384
Valeria!
Open the door!

45:17.948 --> 45:19.723
Get off the bed, Valeria!

45:19.750 --> 45:20.820
Open the door!

45:22.152 --> 45:24.291
I can't.

45:24.321 --> 45:27.461
He's under the bed.

45:32.496 --> 45:34.601
Ah!

46:50.674 --> 46:52.051
Valeria!

46:52.075 --> 46:54.021
Did someone bother you?

46:54.044 --> 46:55.990
Did they steal something?

46:56.013 --> 46:57.321
Where's Valeria?

46:57.347 --> 46:58.758
Valeria?

46:58.782 --> 47:00.989
Did they steal something
from her?

47:01.018 --> 47:02.656
Her blouse or something?

47:02.686 --> 47:05.997
Where the fuck is Valeria?!

47:06.023 --> 47:08.264
Did they take...

47:08.292 --> 47:09.930
Her?

47:09.960 --> 47:12.236
Aluxes do not take people.

47:12.262 --> 47:15.675
They steal things...
and stuff.

47:15.699 --> 47:20.273
Unless they want to
take something...

47:20.304 --> 47:23.342
from her.

47:27.377 --> 47:29.516
Valeria?

47:29.546 --> 47:31.184
Valeria!

47:31.982 --> 47:33.723
Valeria!

47:34.551 --> 47:36.224
Valeria!

47:37.955 --> 47:39.593
Valeria!

47:40.891 --> 47:43.098
Valeria!

47:51.301 --> 47:53.281
Valeria!

47:55.839 --> 47:57.944
Valeria!

48:05.649 --> 48:07.890
Valeria!

48:09.786 --> 48:11.925
Valeria!

50:39.569 --> 50:41.446
Valeria!

50:46.476 --> 50:48.217
Valeria!

50:52.983 --> 50:54.462
Valeria.

50:54.484 --> 50:55.588
Valeria!

50:55.752 --> 50:57.060
Valeria!

50:57.220 --> 50:58.460
Valeria!

50:59.656 --> 51:01.602
Valeria!

51:02.325 --> 51:04.805
Valeria!

51:07.264 --> 51:08.709
I'm sorry!

51:11.234 --> 51:13.908
I'm sorry!

And take off that raggedy dress!
I've had it with you!

What were you saying,
my boy?

53:42.519 --> 53:44.499
My green backpack.
Have you seen it?

53:44.521 --> 53:47.092
Right. I washed it and it's

that fucking window.

54:19.422 --> 54:20.526
It's late!

Hurry up and grab some

Hey, dude.

55:20.950 --> 55:23.226
Don't tell me the princess
still gets scared of me.

55:23.253 --> 55:24.789
So, Pepe, you'll take care
of my garbage, right?

55:24.821 --> 55:27.267
- I left it outside for you.
- You got it, boss.

55:27.290 --> 55:29.065

- No, boogey, no!

55:37.467 --> 55:40.812
C'mon! I'm totally harmless.

Alright, boss.

56:09.532 --> 56:12.672
Mom, will you let me
go play soccer?

56:12.702 --> 56:15.273
Well, just for a little while,
'cause it's late.

56:15.305 --> 56:16.010
Thanks!

56:16.039 --> 56:19.782
