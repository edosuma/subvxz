WEBVTT

00:00.771 --> 00:03.404
(Engines roaring)

00:09.009 --> 00:12.313
(Whispers) The ship's
overtaken by rats.

00:15.746 --> 00:18.218
(Man whispers) The
ship's overtaken by rats.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.390
(Woman whispers) Okay.

00:21.752 --> 00:24.554
(Whispers) The ship's
overtaken by rats.

00:24.555 --> 00:27.558
(Man panting)

00:30.701 --> 00:32.063
(Mutters)

00:37.438 --> 00:39.309
(Scottish accent) Not
exactly a frequent flyer,

00:39.310 --> 00:40.440
are you, luv?

00:40.441 --> 00:41.771
These international flights,

00:41.772 --> 00:43.813
they can be hell on
the ol' stomach, eh?

00:43.814 --> 00:46.045
Mm.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.318
You feeling better, hon?

00:48.719 --> 00:50.720
That...

00:50.721 --> 00:52.522
That man...

00:52.523 --> 00:54.424
Filled with rats.

00:54.425 --> 00:56.086
(Pants)

00:56.087 --> 00:57.257
Uh...

00:57.258 --> 00:59.489
Can you take your
seat, please, sir?

00:59.490 --> 01:01.191
Just... this plane's
filled with rats.

01:01.192 --> 01:03.533
(Whispers) Okay. (Pants)
And we... we gotta kill them all,

01:03.534 --> 01:05.335
starting with the queen.

01:05.336 --> 01:06.297
Aah!

01:06.298 --> 01:08.238
(Passengers screaming)

01:08.239 --> 01:10.271
(Air whooshes)

01:12.143 --> 01:14.174
(Stafford) What's
the deal with you

01:14.175 --> 01:16.346
and detective Tommy Sullivan?

01:16.347 --> 01:17.807
Am I gonna have to
fight a duel with that guy

01:17.808 --> 01:20.150
every time I want to
ask you out or what?

01:20.151 --> 01:22.282
(Laughs) Well, I would
pay to see that, but... Mm.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.354
(Chuckles) I-I don't think so.

01:24.355 --> 01:26.286
But there is a story there, huh?

01:26.287 --> 01:27.517
Yeah.

01:27.518 --> 01:29.559
A long one...

01:29.560 --> 01:30.720
Mm.

01:30.721 --> 01:32.091
That I'm not telling.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.363
Well, I don't
want you to tell it.

01:33.364 --> 01:34.684
I just want to
know it has an end.

01:36.827 --> 01:39.199
Tommy and I dated,

01:39.200 --> 01:41.171
some stuff happened,

01:41.172 --> 01:42.632
and now I'm out with you,

01:42.633 --> 01:45.104
having a very nice time.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.137
End of story.

01:47.138 --> 01:49.839
This was nice, wasn't it?

01:49.840 --> 01:51.541
Yeah.

01:51.542 --> 01:53.584
Surprisingly so.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.318
It doesn't have to
end here, you know?

01:58.319 --> 02:01.351
It kinda does. Lacey.

02:01.352 --> 02:04.194
She's a big girl. She's
with her grandmother.

02:04.195 --> 02:06.296
All you gotta do is call her,

02:06.297 --> 02:08.658
tell her you're gonna
have a late night.

02:08.659 --> 02:12.702
A very late... night.

02:12.703 --> 02:14.565
Hmm.

02:25.176 --> 02:27.348
(Clicks tongue)

02:33.624 --> 02:35.925
Hey, it's me.

02:35.926 --> 02:37.287
Can you stay a little longer?

02:37.288 --> 02:38.259
(Joan) Funny, Lacey just

02:38.260 --> 02:39.759
asked me to spend the night,

02:39.760 --> 02:41.461
have a girls' movie
night, just the three of us.

02:41.462 --> 02:42.632
Okay, but...

02:42.633 --> 02:44.834
Make it two.

02:44.835 --> 02:46.696
I'm gonna be out late.

02:46.697 --> 02:49.168
Uh, I think she was trying

02:49.169 --> 02:51.301
to mend the fences between us.

02:51.302 --> 02:52.642
I think that's gonna take

02:52.643 --> 02:54.574
a little more than popcorn
and a movie, don't you?

02:54.575 --> 02:56.646
Okay. Right. It wasn't my idea.

02:56.647 --> 02:58.648
Never mind. You're
having fun. Stay out.

02:58.649 --> 03:00.810
Better for us both. Thank you.

03:00.811 --> 03:02.453
I think.

03:04.315 --> 03:06.317
(Sighs)

03:08.719 --> 03:11.190
My mommy just
extended my curfew.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.293
Mm.

03:13.294 --> 03:17.367
(Jet engines roaring)

03:17.368 --> 03:19.369
(Explosion)

03:19.370 --> 03:20.930
(Woman gasps and screams)

03:20.931 --> 03:22.732
What the hell just happened?

03:22.733 --> 03:24.735
(Electricity clanks)

03:27.308 --> 03:30.209
(Sirens wailing)

03:30.210 --> 03:33.212
(Emergency radio chatter)

03:33.213 --> 03:36.216
(Indistinct conversations)

03:38.889 --> 03:41.892
(Wailing continues)

03:43.724 --> 03:45.895
Where's the m.E.?

03:45.896 --> 03:47.557
There she is.

03:47.558 --> 03:50.330
(Wailing continues)

03:50.331 --> 03:51.801
(Man) Hey!

03:51.802 --> 03:54.003
We need six more hoses
on that westside fire.

03:54.004 --> 03:56.606
We need to setup that perimeter.

03:56.607 --> 03:58.338
What do you know?

03:58.339 --> 04:00.370
You're looking at flight
875, or what's left of it.

04:00.371 --> 04:02.312
Antigua to Philly.

04:02.313 --> 04:03.373
82 souls on the manifest.

04:03.374 --> 04:04.544
What brought it down?

04:04.545 --> 04:06.015
N.t.s.b.'s gonna
figure that out.

04:06.016 --> 04:07.677
All we know is,
they lost altitude,

04:07.678 --> 04:09.619
clipped a few trees over there,
and broke off the tail section.

04:09.620 --> 04:11.321
The main section
cleared the woods,

04:11.322 --> 04:13.252
but it took out this power grid.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.924
Blacked out half the city.

04:14.925 --> 04:16.386
Intentionally?
(Martin) I don't think so.

04:16.387 --> 04:17.927
I think the pilot dumped
fuel before he hit,

04:17.928 --> 04:19.589
or else this whole thing
would've blown sky-high.

04:19.590 --> 04:20.990
And we got survivors.

04:20.991 --> 04:23.032
Anybody set up an airlift to
the burn unit over at county?

04:23.033 --> 04:25.395
Who's in charge here?
(Man) You're looking at it.

04:25.396 --> 04:27.036
We've got four
paramedic crews here.

04:27.037 --> 04:29.769
The rest are all over the
city dealing with that blackout.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.301
What about n.T.S.B.?

04:31.302 --> 04:32.442
They're six hours
out. They can't get in.

04:32.443 --> 04:34.904
The power outage
shut down the airport.

04:34.905 --> 04:37.877
(Wailing continues)

04:37.878 --> 04:40.279
(Amplified voice) Medical
personnel, listen up.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.751
My name's Charles Stafford.

04:41.752 --> 04:43.052
I am the health commissioner.

04:43.053 --> 04:46.856
We're gonna set up a
triage area off to my left.

04:46.857 --> 04:48.388
(Radio chatter continues) We're
gonna make a makeshift morgue

04:48.389 --> 04:49.559
in this building over
here to my right.

04:49.560 --> 04:52.322
Let's move, people. Go!

04:52.323 --> 04:54.063
(Man over radio) Copy, medic
16. We've got it coming your way.

04:54.064 --> 04:56.697
(Siren whoops)

04:58.028 --> 05:00.371
Okay. He's all set.

05:02.002 --> 05:06.035
(Sighs) That guy says the
same thing as everybody else.

05:06.036 --> 05:07.637
Crazy guy with a gun

05:07.638 --> 05:09.479
shot out a window,
depressurized the cabin.

05:09.480 --> 05:11.541
The f.A.A. Says there was

05:11.542 --> 05:13.543
a U.S. air marshal on board,

05:13.544 --> 05:14.814
a John Davies.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.516
Former marine corps.

05:16.517 --> 05:19.519
Manifest puts him in seat 26d.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.351
(Stafford) Well, I say,

05:21.352 --> 05:23.092
we better we find
him if he's still alive.

05:23.093 --> 05:24.594
Find out why he didn't
subdue the gunman.

05:24.595 --> 05:26.627
Maybe he is the gunman.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.068
The crash of a passenger
plane into a power station

05:39.069 --> 05:41.070
has plunged Philly into
darkness and chaos.

05:41.071 --> 05:42.972
There have been reports
of looting and violence

05:42.973 --> 05:44.514
throughout the city.

05:44.515 --> 05:45.975
And we are live at
the scene of the crash

05:45.976 --> 05:47.517
that caused it all

05:47.518 --> 05:50.349
with Dr. Kate Murphy,
chief medical examiner.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.683
What is the death
toll so far, Dr. Murphy?

05:53.684 --> 05:55.485
I'm not at Liberty to
release that information yet.

05:55.486 --> 05:57.427
We still have people
inside that plane,

05:57.428 --> 05:58.928
both living and dead.

05:58.929 --> 06:00.390
And our first responders
are here to make sure

06:00.391 --> 06:01.931
that there are more of
the former than the latter.

06:01.932 --> 06:03.633
(Sirens wailing,
emergency radio chatter)

06:03.634 --> 06:05.465
You need to give
me more than that.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.936
Excuse me?

06:06.937 --> 06:08.968
You know who sent me here.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.140
District attorney Dan Russell.

06:11.141 --> 06:13.002
He told me to come down here

06:13.003 --> 06:14.804
and get some hero shots
of you, make you look good,

06:14.805 --> 06:18.077
and in return, you'd be a
little more... forthcoming.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.779
So how about a few sound bites

06:19.780 --> 06:22.011
from our, uh, next
congresswoman?

06:22.012 --> 06:25.115
(Wailing continues)

06:27.788 --> 06:30.790
(Indistinct conversations)

06:30.791 --> 06:33.062
(Man sniffles) Ahh.

06:33.063 --> 06:34.764
(Emergency radio chatter)

06:34.765 --> 06:37.427
Sir. Hey, sir.

06:37.428 --> 06:38.768
W-Were you on the plane?

06:38.769 --> 06:40.730
Yeah. You're damn right I was.

06:40.731 --> 06:42.672
Okay. Well, I'm
just trying to help.

06:42.673 --> 06:43.833
That's... that's him. What?

06:43.834 --> 06:44.974
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on. That's...

06:44.975 --> 06:46.636
That's the jacked
up son of a bitch

06:46.637 --> 06:47.807
who started shooting.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.008
You sure?

06:49.009 --> 06:50.610
Aye, I'm sure. He shot
us out of the damn sky!

06:50.611 --> 06:53.042
So a trained air marshal
flipped out midflight

06:53.043 --> 06:55.515
and brought down a jet
he's supposed to protect?

06:55.516 --> 06:57.016
I want to know
everything about this guy...

06:57.017 --> 06:59.519
Where he's traveled,
where he's trained...

06:59.520 --> 07:01.591
And why he had
a seizure midflight.

07:01.592 --> 07:03.192
Petechial hemorrhaging,

07:03.193 --> 07:05.054
antemortem bite
marks on his tongue...

07:05.055 --> 07:06.996
He had a seizure
before the crash.

07:06.997 --> 07:08.898
We need to pull blood
for a tox screen a.S.A.P.

07:08.899 --> 07:10.660
Okay, have Kate
catalog everything.

07:10.661 --> 07:12.902
Have your people load him
up, take him to the m.E.O.

07:12.903 --> 07:14.664
Go with them.

07:14.665 --> 07:16.936
The tail of this
plane is still missing.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.739
There may be more
dead or more survivors.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.671
I'm on it.

07:21.672 --> 07:25.074
Megan, listen, people
go crazy during a blackout.

07:25.075 --> 07:26.976
Remember New York in '91?

07:26.977 --> 07:28.718
Yes, I remember.

07:28.719 --> 07:30.179
Just be careful, all right?

07:30.180 --> 07:33.182
Okay. You be careful, too.

07:33.183 --> 07:35.885
Okay. Thanks for caring.

07:35.886 --> 07:38.228
I'll call you to check in later.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.990
Hey.

07:40.991 --> 07:42.992
You need an extra pair of eyes?

07:42.993 --> 07:44.694
Uh, yeah.

07:44.695 --> 07:47.196
Sure.

07:47.197 --> 07:48.898
Flashlight,

07:48.899 --> 07:50.039
glow sticks,

07:50.040 --> 07:51.841
and battery-powered radio.

07:51.842 --> 07:53.002
(Laughs) Oh, boy.

07:53.003 --> 07:54.544
You girls are prepared.

07:54.545 --> 07:56.145
I watch this great series
called "doomsday prep wars."

07:56.146 --> 07:59.178
The first rule of surviving
the apocalypse... batteries.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.551
My first rule back in the day...

08:01.552 --> 08:03.813
Eat the perishables.

08:03.814 --> 08:05.685
(Laughs)

08:05.686 --> 08:07.957
You know, I haven't
been in a blackout since...

08:07.958 --> 08:10.760
New York, 1991.

08:10.761 --> 08:13.192
And I ended up walking 32 blocks

08:13.193 --> 08:14.894
from the train station

08:14.895 --> 08:16.195
to your mother's
tiny little apartment

08:16.196 --> 08:18.027
on the westside. (Chuckles)

08:18.028 --> 08:20.169
And that's when I
got my big surprise.

08:20.170 --> 08:24.675
I found out that she was
dating Tommy Sullivan.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.079
Were they in love?

08:30.080 --> 08:31.781
No.

08:31.782 --> 08:33.182
It was just...

08:33.183 --> 08:34.944
Kid stuff.

08:34.945 --> 08:36.245
I tried to tell her
so at the time,

08:36.246 --> 08:38.517
but she wouldn't listen.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.720
I know you probably
don't understand

08:40.721 --> 08:41.991
why your mom and I aren't

08:41.992 --> 08:44.023
on such friendly
terms these days,

08:44.024 --> 08:48.097
but I want you to know, it
has nothing to do with you.

08:48.098 --> 08:49.258
I know.

08:49.259 --> 08:51.060
Okay, good.

08:51.061 --> 08:53.003
I know why you've been fighting.

08:55.966 --> 08:58.267
Mom thinks granddad
didn't kill himself,

08:58.268 --> 08:59.669
that he was murdered.

08:59.670 --> 09:01.811
And now she wants to
bring up his body, and...

09:01.812 --> 09:03.142
Lacey...

09:03.143 --> 09:05.014
I overheard you, and she
doesn't know that I know.

09:05.015 --> 09:06.916
I just... i had to ask.

09:06.917 --> 09:08.818
I don't want to talk
about this, okay?

09:08.819 --> 09:10.119
But, grandma, wh... what if...

09:10.120 --> 09:11.921
What if mom's right?

09:11.922 --> 09:12.982
Why wouldn't you
want to know the truth?

09:12.983 --> 09:14.153
I said no.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.685
I didn't want to
have this awful,

09:15.686 --> 09:17.687
morbid conversation with her,

09:17.688 --> 09:20.330
and I certainly don't
want to have it with you.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.042
(Indistinct conversations)

09:32.043 --> 09:33.202
How many are there?

09:33.203 --> 09:35.204
Uh, 52 dead so far,
but the good news is,

09:35.205 --> 09:37.046
we have had
reports of survivors.

09:37.047 --> 09:40.049
(Electricity crackles)

09:40.050 --> 09:41.580
Is our generator gonna hold?

09:41.581 --> 09:42.752
Oh, it's gon' hold.

09:42.753 --> 09:44.083
The apocalypse will come and go

09:44.084 --> 09:45.284
before we shut down.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.056
But just in case, I
broke out these puppies.

09:47.057 --> 09:49.018
Don't think I don't watch
"doomsday prep wars"

09:49.019 --> 09:50.620
on the splice channel.

09:50.621 --> 09:52.121
So I just put

09:52.122 --> 09:54.363
seven crash survivors in
the conference room. What?

09:54.364 --> 09:56.225
They didn't want to go to the
hospital to get checked out,

09:56.226 --> 09:58.027
they just wanted to be
here with their loved ones.

09:58.028 --> 09:59.899
I'd really like to
interview them.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.771
I don't think so. Who
are you anyway?

10:01.772 --> 10:03.673
This is Mandy Wells
from wvgh. She's with me.

10:03.674 --> 10:05.905
Just keep the survivors
there until we're ready

10:05.906 --> 10:07.236
to have them I.D. The
deceased, all right?

10:07.237 --> 10:08.808
And then we'll see if they
want to talk to the press.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.339
(Elevator bell dings)

10:10.340 --> 10:12.381
(Indistinct conversations)

10:12.382 --> 10:14.043
Ohh.

10:14.044 --> 10:15.214
Can I help you folks?

10:15.215 --> 10:16.846
We were at the airport.

10:16.847 --> 10:17.987
We were waiting for
the flight to come in

10:17.988 --> 10:19.148
when we found out...

10:19.149 --> 10:20.349
You have family on flight 875?

10:20.350 --> 10:21.721
Yes.

10:21.722 --> 10:22.992
Yes, my husband.
His name is Thomas.

10:22.993 --> 10:24.924
And my grandson Max.
He was traveling alone.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.225
Please check.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.027
Okay, this is Dr. Brumfield.
He'll get you situated,

10:28.028 --> 10:30.029
and we'll find out what
happened to your loved ones.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.360
You have a list in
your hand right there.

10:31.361 --> 10:33.002
Now is that a list of people
that made it and who didn't?

10:33.003 --> 10:35.104
Because I just need to know.

10:35.105 --> 10:37.636
Is my wife...

10:37.637 --> 10:38.938
Is she dead?

10:38.939 --> 10:42.111
Pam Jacks. She's
a flight attendant.

10:42.112 --> 10:45.114
The list is incomplete.

10:45.115 --> 10:48.348
But Jacks...

10:50.851 --> 10:52.051
I don't see her name.

10:52.052 --> 10:56.656
What about Thomas?
Tom westphall?

11:03.694 --> 11:04.995
I'm so sorry.

11:06.697 --> 11:08.968
(Sobs) No.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.841
Please. No. (Sniffles)

11:11.842 --> 11:13.202
No. (Crying)

11:13.203 --> 11:16.675
Um, Mrs. Westphall,
just one question.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.247
(Lowered voice) Okay,
okay, come here. Come here.

11:18.248 --> 11:19.779
Ow! (Normal voice)
Are you serious?

11:19.780 --> 11:21.080
That woman just found
out she lost her husband.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.411
I am just doing my job.

11:22.412 --> 11:23.783
Adam.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.054
(Scoffs)

11:25.055 --> 11:26.455
Yeah.

11:26.456 --> 11:28.457
We're about to
autopsy the air marshal.

11:28.458 --> 11:29.789
You in or out?

11:29.790 --> 11:31.120
Uh, I'm out.

11:31.121 --> 11:32.792
I'm on crowd control.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.924
Oh, Megan.

11:34.925 --> 11:36.465
You hear from Tommy?

11:36.466 --> 11:37.827
Not yet. You?

11:37.828 --> 11:38.899
No.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.136
So... the blackout of '91, huh?

11:47.137 --> 11:49.008
Guess you two go way back.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.480
Well, it's... it's complicated.

11:51.481 --> 11:54.144
I'm a pretty
bright girl. Try me.

11:56.116 --> 12:00.089
(Tires squealing)

12:00.090 --> 12:01.791
Must be debris from the plane.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.152
(Beep)

12:03.153 --> 12:04.723
Call Adam Lucas.

12:04.724 --> 12:05.855
(Autodials)

12:05.856 --> 12:07.026
(Busy signal beeping)

12:07.027 --> 12:08.497
The cell towers must
be taking a beating.

12:08.498 --> 12:10.499
I-I'd try, but my
battery's dead.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.831
Call Megan.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.032
(Auto dials)

12:13.033 --> 12:14.303
This is Megan hunt.
Leave a message.

12:14.304 --> 12:16.735
Megan, listen, it's
Tommy. I'm just checking in.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.037
I think I got a lead
on the tail section,

12:18.038 --> 12:20.070
but it's... it's pretty
damn remote out here.

12:21.872 --> 12:23.142
What the...

12:23.143 --> 12:25.174
(Tires squealing)

12:25.175 --> 12:26.515
(Wood cracks)

12:26.516 --> 12:30.220
(Crashing)

12:35.185 --> 12:36.325
(Buzzing)

12:36.326 --> 12:39.058
Petechial hemorrhaging
means asphyxiation

12:39.059 --> 12:40.229
prior to crash.

12:40.230 --> 12:41.530
(Stafford) Yeah,
and prior to that,

12:41.531 --> 12:44.233
he was screaming
about a flying rat queen.

12:44.234 --> 12:46.065
This guy's high as
a kite on something.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.397
On what we won't know until
the electricity comes back on.

12:48.398 --> 12:50.299
And all the labs are down.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.301
We'll just have to wait to
find out what it is he took.

12:52.302 --> 12:53.843
Or was given.

12:53.844 --> 12:57.146
I highly doubt that he
decided to get his fix midair.

12:57.147 --> 12:58.848
This looks like foul play to me.

12:58.849 --> 13:00.009
That's a leap.

13:00.010 --> 13:01.180
He was a U.S. air marshal.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.152
They're routinely
subjected to drug tests

13:03.153 --> 13:04.513
and background checks.

13:04.514 --> 13:06.956
What, so nobody ever
faked a drug test before?

13:06.957 --> 13:08.958
Have a buddy come
in, pee in the cup.

13:08.959 --> 13:10.960
Are you speaking
from experience?

13:10.961 --> 13:12.962
I'm speaking as someone
who knows human beings.

13:12.963 --> 13:15.264
They are predictably
unpredictable.

13:15.265 --> 13:17.266
There's no jaundice, no
track marks, no bruxism.

13:17.267 --> 13:19.268
This guy was not a drug addict.

13:19.269 --> 13:20.569
Wait. So what are you saying,

13:20.570 --> 13:22.231
he was just randomly drugged?

13:22.232 --> 13:24.433
Not random. He was an
undercover air marshal.

13:24.434 --> 13:25.975
Maybe somebody found out,

13:25.976 --> 13:27.877
somebody who had
something so big to hide,

13:27.878 --> 13:29.438
they were willing to do anything

13:29.439 --> 13:30.980
to keep it secret.

13:30.981 --> 13:32.311
A lot of ifs in that scenario.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.313
Okay. We've got six people
in the conference room

13:34.314 --> 13:37.246
who had first-class
seats to the show.

13:37.247 --> 13:39.088
Why don't you find
out what they saw?

13:39.089 --> 13:40.419
(Buzzes)

13:40.420 --> 13:43.322
So, Mr. Franco, I
need you to tell me

13:43.323 --> 13:45.054
everything you
remember about the flight.

13:45.055 --> 13:46.255
Anything at all.

13:46.256 --> 13:48.497
Stupid things, things
you don't think matter,

13:48.498 --> 13:50.099
maybe they do.

13:50.100 --> 13:52.902
You know, I remember
there was this...

13:52.903 --> 13:55.204
Child kicking the
back of my chair.

13:55.205 --> 13:56.365
(Boy) I gotta go pee.

13:56.366 --> 13:57.836
And he was trying to
get to the bathroom,

13:57.837 --> 13:59.869
but he practically ripped
the back of my chair off

13:59.870 --> 14:01.240
trying to get there,

14:01.241 --> 14:03.212
so I turned around
to say something,

14:03.213 --> 14:05.174
and he bumped into
the guy next to him,

14:05.175 --> 14:07.276
the gunman.

14:07.277 --> 14:08.577
Did you notice
anything else about him?

14:08.578 --> 14:11.180
Yeah. I thought it
was odd, you know?

14:11.181 --> 14:12.953
This kid plows right into him...

14:14.084 --> 14:15.384
And he doesn't even blink.

14:15.385 --> 14:17.286
He just keeps staring.

14:17.287 --> 14:19.989
(Whispers indistinctly) (Man,
Indian accent) I remember

14:19.990 --> 14:21.160
he seemed polite.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.491
When we boarded,

14:22.492 --> 14:24.493
he helped a woman
with her carry-on luggage.

14:24.494 --> 14:27.266
Uh, "very... polite,"

14:27.267 --> 14:29.498
I remember saying to my wife.

14:29.499 --> 14:32.441
She thought the
man liked the woman.

14:32.442 --> 14:34.143
(Stafford) Why
did she think that?

14:34.144 --> 14:36.145
Because he came up
to her and spoke with her

14:36.146 --> 14:37.947
a few times during the flight.

14:37.948 --> 14:39.108
I didn't really

14:39.109 --> 14:41.151
notice him again until...

14:43.283 --> 14:45.584
Anyway, he pulls out
this ginormous gun

14:45.585 --> 14:47.116
from god knows where,

14:47.117 --> 14:49.118
and starts waving it around,
yelling something about

14:49.119 --> 14:50.419
flying rats.

14:50.420 --> 14:52.891
He aimed it right at me.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.123
(Screaming)

14:54.124 --> 14:55.524
Well, not at me. At
the chick beside me.

14:55.525 --> 14:58.297
She was wearing
this, uh, blue scarf.

14:58.298 --> 15:01.070
Poor thing had been airsick
during most of the flight.

15:01.071 --> 15:02.571
She squeezed my hand

15:02.572 --> 15:04.573
during the shooting,

15:04.574 --> 15:07.006
during the crash.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.408
I mean, it felt like hours, but
it must have been seconds?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.180
Tanner,

15:11.181 --> 15:13.912
the... the... the woman
in the blue scarf,

15:13.913 --> 15:15.384
do you remember her name?

15:15.385 --> 15:16.685
She said her name was Carla.

15:16.686 --> 15:18.917
Carla Mendez,
seat 23a. Deceased.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.249
She's here in the morgue.

15:20.250 --> 15:22.621
One thing that they remember
about her is the blue scarf.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.323
That and the, uh,
the air marshal

15:24.324 --> 15:26.055
was fixated on her.

15:26.056 --> 15:27.356
We need to take a look at her,

15:27.357 --> 15:29.228
verify her identity, find
out where she's been,

15:29.229 --> 15:30.559
exactly what she was
doing on that flight.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.331
You think she's behind all this?

15:32.332 --> 15:33.562
Maybe another victim.

15:33.563 --> 15:35.304
People saw her go
into the bathroom a lot.

15:35.305 --> 15:36.966
She coulda been drugged, too.

15:36.967 --> 15:38.107
(Cell phone chimes)

15:38.108 --> 15:40.009
Hmm.

15:40.010 --> 15:42.111
It's voice mail from Tommy.

15:42.112 --> 15:43.272
Service has been crap all night.

15:43.273 --> 15:44.313
You're lucky you got anything.

15:44.314 --> 15:45.544
Put it on speaker.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.076
Megan, listen, it's Tommy.

15:47.077 --> 15:48.277
I'm just checking in.

15:48.278 --> 15:50.079
I think I got a lead
on the tail section,

15:50.080 --> 15:52.051
but it's... it's pretty
damn remote out here.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.382
(Tires squeal)

15:53.383 --> 15:55.425
(Wood cracks, crashing)

15:57.587 --> 15:59.288
Megan, Megan,
where are you going?

15:59.289 --> 16:00.389
I'm gonna find him.

16:00.390 --> 16:01.730
No, you're not.
It's chaos out there.

16:01.731 --> 16:03.292
You stay here. Do
your job. Find out who...

16:03.293 --> 16:04.633
No! Something has happened...

16:04.634 --> 16:05.995
Megan, I will find him.

16:05.996 --> 16:07.166
He's right.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.337
He's got a badge, gun,

16:08.338 --> 16:10.039
whole police department
backing him up.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.500
You find him.

16:11.501 --> 16:13.103
Okay.

16:17.347 --> 16:19.048
He's gonna be all right.

16:19.049 --> 16:20.150
Yeah.

16:26.656 --> 16:28.358
(Horns honk)

16:30.590 --> 16:32.161
(Touch screen clicks)

16:32.162 --> 16:33.522
(Breathes unsteadily)

16:33.523 --> 16:36.295
(Phone rings)

16:36.296 --> 16:37.267
Tommy...

16:37.268 --> 16:38.597
Sullivan. You missed me.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.199
Leave a message after the beep.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.401
(Pants)

16:42.402 --> 16:44.673
Uh, Tommy, I don't...

16:44.674 --> 16:46.675
I don't know if
you're gonna get this,

16:46.676 --> 16:49.308
but if you get this...

16:49.309 --> 16:50.479
I...

16:50.480 --> 16:52.241
(Voice breaks) I need
you to know that...

16:52.242 --> 16:54.644
Everything okay out here?

16:56.086 --> 16:57.386
Uh, yeah. Yeah,
everything's fine.

16:57.387 --> 16:58.687
I'll be in in a sec.

16:58.688 --> 17:01.050
(Exhales)

17:01.051 --> 17:02.321
(Inhales and exhales)

17:02.322 --> 17:03.722
(Sniffles)

17:03.723 --> 17:07.526
(Crickets chirping)

17:07.527 --> 17:08.697
(Moans)

17:08.698 --> 17:10.059
Ohh.

17:10.060 --> 17:11.360
(Grunts) You okay?

17:11.361 --> 17:14.263
Yeah. My left ankle's
jacked, though.

17:14.264 --> 17:15.434
You?

17:15.435 --> 17:19.238
(Groans) My
shoulder's a little...

17:19.239 --> 17:21.039
Oh, the phone's broken.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.511
(Grunts)

17:22.512 --> 17:24.343
(Exhales)

17:24.344 --> 17:25.774
Wait a second.

17:25.775 --> 17:27.376
We almost hit somebody.

17:27.377 --> 17:30.319
(Both pant)

17:30.320 --> 17:32.652
(Grunts)

17:34.354 --> 17:36.255
(Tommy) She's alive.

17:36.256 --> 17:39.128
Hi. Wh-what's your name?

17:39.129 --> 17:41.260
(Strained voice) Pam.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.791
Please...

17:42.792 --> 17:45.094
You have to help us.

17:45.095 --> 17:46.495
Us?

17:46.496 --> 17:48.367
Pam, where... Where'd
you come from?

17:48.368 --> 17:50.640
I don't... i don't...

17:53.343 --> 17:56.475
Down...

17:56.476 --> 17:59.649
Mm. We'll be right back, Pam.

18:17.167 --> 18:18.397
Where you going?

18:18.398 --> 18:19.598
I thought you were helping
us with crowd control.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.431
Cr... i'm... I'm not a
traffic cop, Dr. Murphy.

18:22.432 --> 18:24.303
You know, Mandy's downstairs
prepping her cameraman.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.604
I'm about to bring him up.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.136
So maybe you could
rein in the attitude a little?

18:27.137 --> 18:28.307
You know, it's good to know

18:28.308 --> 18:29.878
you got your
priorities in order.

18:29.879 --> 18:32.881
If anyone has access to
a radio or a working TV,

18:32.882 --> 18:34.713
they need information
about what's going on here.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.685
That is a priority.

18:36.686 --> 18:39.288
So feel free to tell me whatever
crawled up your ass. (Elevator bell dings)

18:39.289 --> 18:40.820
Or better yet, get over it.

18:52.162 --> 18:55.364
(Indistinct conversations)

18:55.365 --> 18:56.905
You want to talk about it?

18:56.906 --> 18:58.267
Nope.

18:58.268 --> 18:59.568
Okay.

18:59.569 --> 19:01.470
So let's find out what made
Carla Mendez so special,

19:01.471 --> 19:03.472
it drove our air marshal
friend off the deep end.

19:03.473 --> 19:05.914
Yes, I'm beginning to agree
with you. He was drugged.

19:05.915 --> 19:08.317
Maybe he thought she was
some kind of terrorist threat.

19:08.318 --> 19:10.179
Well, maybe he was right.

19:10.180 --> 19:12.351
Let's have a look at her and
find out. (Electricity crackles)

19:12.352 --> 19:13.852
(Curtis) Uh-oh.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.824
Looks like the generator failed.

19:15.825 --> 19:18.827
The backups should kick
on any second. Wait for it.

19:18.828 --> 19:21.190
(Indistinct conversations)

19:21.191 --> 19:22.391
Wait for it.

19:22.392 --> 19:23.862
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

19:23.863 --> 19:25.694
Backup genny's not working.

19:25.695 --> 19:27.236
Aw, hell.

19:27.237 --> 19:29.238
That's not supposed to happen.

19:29.239 --> 19:30.439
You two check on the generator.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.441
On it. Lights.

19:32.442 --> 19:35.404
Here, everybody take
one, turn to channel 3.

19:35.405 --> 19:37.246
Stafford and I will find
the emergency lanterns

19:37.247 --> 19:39.278
in the storage
room in the morgue.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.379
Follow me.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.282
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

19:52.362 --> 19:54.264
Whoa.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.429
Carla Mendez.

20:02.232 --> 20:04.202
Her body is gone.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.835
Not gone.

20:10.780 --> 20:12.582
Stolen.

20:21.691 --> 20:22.652
What do you mean, lockdown?

20:22.653 --> 20:23.992
Megan said a body is missing.

20:23.993 --> 20:25.524
Uh-huh. Somebody stole it,

20:25.525 --> 20:27.356
and nobody's going
anywhere till they find it.

20:27.357 --> 20:28.627
Wait a second.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.499
I mean, why doesn't she
just send in the cavalry?

20:30.500 --> 20:31.630
We can't call the cavalry

20:31.631 --> 20:33.632
until we get this
generator running again.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.634
I'm a doctor, okay?

20:35.635 --> 20:38.768
I'm not an electrician.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.671
Oh, no. No, no, no.

20:42.672 --> 20:45.614
This is not a
blown fuse. L-Look.

20:45.615 --> 20:47.946
You see those wires?
They were cut, deliberately.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.578
(Curtis) Oh, crap.

20:49.579 --> 20:52.281
Call Megan and tell her
this is gonna take a while.

20:52.282 --> 20:55.253
Okay, just... wait a second.
You know how to fix this?

20:55.254 --> 20:57.886
Look, I'm a trained pathologist,
and I have all six seasons

20:57.887 --> 21:00.729
of "doomsday prep
wars" saved on my dvr.

21:00.730 --> 21:02.260
I got this.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.732
Now hand me those pliers.

21:03.733 --> 21:07.566
Hello?

21:07.567 --> 21:09.698
Uh-huh.

21:09.699 --> 21:10.869
(Sighs)

21:10.870 --> 21:12.602
Have you got a light?

21:13.603 --> 21:16.545
"In case of emergency,
use enclosed hex key

21:16.546 --> 21:18.577
to open ceiling panel
and push manual lever."

21:18.578 --> 21:20.278
What ceiling panel?

21:20.279 --> 21:22.681
There's no...
There's no hex key.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.513
Where's the friggin'... where's the
friggin' hex key? (Bangs panel door)

21:24.514 --> 21:26.284
All right, calm down.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.916
Calm down? My
partner's out there.

21:27.917 --> 21:29.788
He may be dead, and...
and I can't go help him

21:29.789 --> 21:31.360
because hey, you know what?

21:31.361 --> 21:32.691
You've got time to give
your press conferences,

21:32.692 --> 21:33.922
but you don't have
time to make sure

21:33.923 --> 21:35.394
that your generators
are up to code

21:35.395 --> 21:37.566
or your damn
elevator is working!

21:37.567 --> 21:38.927
(Creaking) Stop. Listen.

21:38.928 --> 21:41.931
(Creaking continues)

21:45.675 --> 21:47.606
(Loud bang)

21:47.607 --> 21:50.610
(Flames crackling)

21:54.744 --> 21:56.815
Can anybody hear me?

21:56.816 --> 21:59.819
(Breathing heavily)

22:13.533 --> 22:16.565
(Pounding on door)

22:16.566 --> 22:18.437
Hold on.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.609
(Tommy grunts)

22:20.610 --> 22:21.910
Just a second.

22:21.911 --> 22:24.713
(Metal clanks)

22:24.714 --> 22:26.675
(Grunts)

22:26.676 --> 22:28.677
(Groans)

22:28.678 --> 22:29.778
(Metal scrapes)

22:29.779 --> 22:31.079
(Tommy grunts)

22:31.080 --> 22:33.121
Hey. Come on.

22:33.122 --> 22:35.754
Come on out.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.656
I'm Tommy. What's your name?

22:37.657 --> 22:38.787
Max.

22:38.788 --> 22:39.859
You okay, Max?

22:41.761 --> 22:44.564
Come with me. (Exhales deeply)

22:46.766 --> 22:48.967
Max.

22:48.968 --> 22:50.599
I hid in the bathroom.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.841
Of course you did.

22:52.842 --> 22:56.705
I'm not gonna lie to you.
This might hurt a little bit.

22:56.706 --> 22:57.876
(Exhales)

22:57.877 --> 22:59.708
(Clicks)

22:59.709 --> 23:02.652
Somehow I knew.

23:03.713 --> 23:06.885
(Crying) I knew I was
gonna die like this.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.518
You're not gonna die.

23:09.519 --> 23:11.560
Not if I can help it.

23:11.561 --> 23:14.963
I'm just gonna put some
padding to hold it in place.

23:14.964 --> 23:17.426
(Pam groans)

23:17.427 --> 23:19.798
(All shouting at once)

23:19.799 --> 23:21.870
All right, everybody,
be quiet! Be quiet!

23:21.871 --> 23:23.602
We're asking that
you remain calm.

23:23.603 --> 23:24.633
(Tanner) Calm?

23:24.634 --> 23:26.174
You got armed
guards at the doors.

23:26.175 --> 23:27.836
(Megan) Because
somebody in this room

23:27.837 --> 23:29.578
sabotaged our generators

23:29.579 --> 23:32.010
in order to steal a
key piece of evidence.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.542
Okay, tell us what
the evidence was.

23:33.543 --> 23:34.683
We can help look for it.

23:34.684 --> 23:36.845
It was the body of
the woman in 23a...

23:36.846 --> 23:38.547
Carla Mendez.

23:38.548 --> 23:40.719
Whoever was trying to
cover their tracks in the air

23:40.720 --> 23:42.891
is now trying to cover
them on the ground,

23:42.892 --> 23:44.893
and no one is leaving this room

23:44.894 --> 23:46.855
until we find out who and why.

23:46.856 --> 23:48.727
(Man) Well, what does
she have to do with me

23:48.728 --> 23:49.898
or her or him?

23:49.899 --> 23:51.059
We weren't on the plane.

23:51.060 --> 23:53.662
Yeah, but they all were.

23:53.663 --> 23:55.033
(Huffs) Don't...
Don't look at me.

23:55.034 --> 23:58.567
Look, not to be non, you
know, post racial or anything,

23:58.568 --> 24:01.109
but, uh, can you not
just ask the arab guy?

24:01.110 --> 24:02.871
Okay, I'm sikh, you idiot.

24:02.872 --> 24:05.213
A-And you were sitting
next to her the entire time.

24:05.214 --> 24:06.815
Maybe the air marshal
wasn't staring at her.

24:06.816 --> 24:08.116
Maybe he was staring at you!

24:08.117 --> 24:09.478
(Franco) You
were talking to him.

24:09.479 --> 24:10.649
That's right. I saw you...

24:10.650 --> 24:11.980
No. In the back of the plane.

24:11.981 --> 24:13.081
That's right. You guys
were talking for a long time.

24:13.082 --> 24:14.623
No, no, no, no, no.

24:14.624 --> 24:15.585
You were talking to him!
What were you talking about?

24:15.586 --> 24:17.155
I wa... i wasn't talking to him.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.758
I was hanging out at the...
the stewardess' station.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.630
There's this hot blonde
I was trying to chat up...

24:21.631 --> 24:23.031
That's my wife! Hey!

24:23.032 --> 24:24.533
What did you do, you son
of a bitch? Hey, hey, hey.

24:24.534 --> 24:25.564
(All shouting at once)

24:25.565 --> 24:27.596
Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough!

24:27.597 --> 24:28.767
Come with me. Come with me.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.138
(Indistinct conversations)

24:30.139 --> 24:31.970
Listen to me.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.772
Listen.

24:33.773 --> 24:36.074
I checked the morgue log.

24:36.075 --> 24:37.606
It took a while
because your wife

24:37.607 --> 24:39.578
wasn't in an assigned
section of the plane.

24:39.579 --> 24:42.051
But I can tell you for
sure, she is not here.

24:43.913 --> 24:46.685
You know, she wanted
to retire last year.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.687
You know what I said to her?

24:48.688 --> 24:51.159
"No way.

24:51.160 --> 24:54.122
In this economy?
We need the money."

24:54.123 --> 24:57.566
It's my fault she's up there.

24:57.567 --> 25:01.169
I don't even know why
I went off on that guy

25:01.170 --> 25:02.531
right there.

25:02.532 --> 25:03.802
I don't know.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.804
But for some reason, it
was just the thought of...

25:05.805 --> 25:08.807
(Sighs) The last kind
thing ever said to my wife

25:08.808 --> 25:12.140
coming from a stranger.

25:12.141 --> 25:14.242
Is that stupid?

25:14.243 --> 25:16.846
(Sighs) No.

25:18.718 --> 25:21.550
(Voice breaking) You know...

25:21.551 --> 25:24.252
I've been wracking my brain.

25:24.253 --> 25:26.625
I was trying to think of the...

25:26.626 --> 25:28.798
The last thing I said to her.

25:30.660 --> 25:32.931
I can't.

25:32.932 --> 25:36.534
Because nothing about
that moment said...

25:36.535 --> 25:39.008
"This is the last time."

25:42.572 --> 25:44.613
If we knew when
that was gonna be,

25:44.614 --> 25:47.716
we'd all do things differently.

25:47.717 --> 25:49.017
You lose someone, too, doc?

25:49.018 --> 25:51.650
He went out to find the
tail section of the plane.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.051
Stupid thing is, I know

25:53.052 --> 25:55.083
exactly what my last
words to him were.

25:55.084 --> 25:59.157
And... (Chuckles)
They were not poetry.

25:59.158 --> 26:02.732
They were trite, flippant.

26:05.795 --> 26:08.667
Now I might never see him again.

26:08.668 --> 26:09.938
(Exhales)

26:09.939 --> 26:12.041
I don't know.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.907
(Objects clatter)

26:18.908 --> 26:21.080
Here. How about this?

26:24.814 --> 26:26.155
Let me see.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.157
Mm.

26:29.158 --> 26:30.690
Give me a hand?

26:31.791 --> 26:32.961
Okay.

26:32.962 --> 26:34.823
(Grunts)

26:34.824 --> 26:36.665
All right. Here.

26:36.666 --> 26:38.628
(Grunts)

26:39.769 --> 26:41.630
Mm-hmm.

26:41.631 --> 26:45.734
Listen, i'm... I'm
sorry about Tommy.

26:45.735 --> 26:47.906
I really do hope he's all right.

26:47.907 --> 26:50.078
You wanna talk about it?

26:50.079 --> 26:51.379
Nope.

26:51.380 --> 26:52.981
(Scoffs)

26:52.982 --> 26:55.684
All right, what
exactly is with you?

26:55.685 --> 26:57.746
A reporter asks a couple
questions, and you hulk out.

26:57.747 --> 26:59.317
I mean, she's just
trying to do her job.

26:59.318 --> 27:01.349
Yeah, the job the
d.A. Asked her to do.

27:01.350 --> 27:04.292
To, uh, give you the Dan
Russell treatment, right?

27:04.293 --> 27:05.694
Make you look like a hero.

27:05.695 --> 27:07.696
So what? Dan's my mentor.

27:07.697 --> 27:09.798
Dan and my dad
are two peas in a pod.

27:09.799 --> 27:11.629
Seeing you follow
in their footsteps is...

27:11.630 --> 27:13.732
What? Triggered some
traumatic childhood memory?

27:13.733 --> 27:14.933
Well, here's a
newsflash for you...

27:14.934 --> 27:17.305
I am not Dan Russell
and I am not your father.

27:17.306 --> 27:19.308
Yeah? Not yet. Oh, please.

27:21.410 --> 27:24.813
Dan and my dad are
actually very good friends.

27:24.814 --> 27:26.214
Well, they are two
high-profile lawyers

27:26.215 --> 27:27.746
in Philadelphia, so...

27:27.747 --> 27:29.277
Yeah, but it's the, uh...

27:29.278 --> 27:32.350
It's the corrupt stuff they've
done over the past few years

27:32.351 --> 27:33.982
that actually binds
them together.

27:33.983 --> 27:36.254
I think that's a bit of an
exaggeration, don't you?

27:36.255 --> 27:38.186
My dad...

27:38.187 --> 27:40.358
He tried to shine a light

27:40.359 --> 27:42.961
on the injustices
against the little guy.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.733
But, uh, little guys
don't buy camera time,

27:44.734 --> 27:48.236
so he moved on to the
bigger and bigger guys.

27:48.237 --> 27:51.700
(Panting) And to win, he...

27:51.701 --> 27:53.842
He had to get into bed
with some ugly people.

27:53.843 --> 27:55.173
Before he knew it,

27:55.174 --> 27:58.877
my dad was crushing the
little guy with the big guy.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.408
And behind closed doors,

28:00.409 --> 28:04.983
a lot of bad stuff got
swept under the rug...

28:04.984 --> 28:07.455
Some of which was
your mentor Dan's.

28:07.456 --> 28:10.859
Right now, you're still
one of the good guys,

28:10.860 --> 28:13.221
but you're signing up for
the same ride my dad's on.

28:13.222 --> 28:15.194
All it costs is your soul.

28:19.929 --> 28:21.731
(Grunting)

28:35.845 --> 28:37.916
Get anything out of
the survivors? Nada.

28:37.917 --> 28:40.949
My, uh, "one of you in this
room is a murderer" routine

28:40.950 --> 28:42.051
needs a little work.

28:45.094 --> 28:46.795
What the hell
happened to you two?

28:46.796 --> 28:48.757
We got stuck in the elevator.
We've been there for hours.

28:48.758 --> 28:50.298
You've been here
this whole time?

28:50.299 --> 28:52.100
Yes. You were supposed
to be finding Tommy.

28:52.101 --> 28:53.431
Megan, we found...

28:53.432 --> 28:54.963
I have been able
to focus on my job

28:54.964 --> 28:56.304
because I thought you
were out there looking for him.

28:56.305 --> 28:57.836
Megan.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.307
We radioed first responders
for Tommy's crash

28:59.308 --> 29:01.009
as soon as we got free.

29:01.010 --> 29:03.972
We found something.

29:03.973 --> 29:05.914
(Clicks flashlight) (Stafford)
Say hello to Carla Mendez,

29:05.915 --> 29:08.777
the infamous woman
in the blue scarf.

29:08.778 --> 29:10.749
Look at this. Look
at these edges.

29:12.822 --> 29:15.784
That didn't happen in the
crash. That's postmortem. Yeah.

29:15.785 --> 29:18.857
(Stafford) See the
white residue right there?

29:18.858 --> 29:21.430
I bet you that tests
positive for cocaine.

29:25.334 --> 29:27.796
From the distention
of her stomach,

29:27.797 --> 29:30.468
I'd say that she swallowed...

29:30.469 --> 29:32.941
At least 80 bags? That's
a street value of what?

29:32.942 --> 29:35.473
80 bags? About $2 million.

29:35.474 --> 29:37.946
Carla Mendez was a drug
mule. What do you want to bet

29:37.947 --> 29:39.307
the air marshal
found out about it?

29:39.308 --> 29:41.049
(Megan) Carla was carrying

29:41.050 --> 29:43.351
at least 80 bags of
cocaine in her stomach.

29:43.352 --> 29:45.814
She becomes sick,
possibly from turbulence.

29:45.815 --> 29:48.016
Or maybe one of
the bags ruptured.

29:48.017 --> 29:50.819
(Whispers indistinctly) (Adam) So
air marshal Davies get suspicious.

29:50.820 --> 29:51.990
Maybe he confronts her.

29:51.991 --> 29:54.122
(Megan) And either
Carla herself or...

29:54.123 --> 29:57.565
More likely an accomplice...
Tanner, sanjit, Roberto?

29:57.566 --> 29:59.427
(Whispers indistinctly)
Drugs Davies to either kill him

29:59.428 --> 30:02.000
or just incapacitate him long
enough to make the getaway.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.531
(Stafford) Instead,
he flips out,

30:03.532 --> 30:05.834
causing the plane to crash.

30:05.835 --> 30:07.906
(Man) Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

30:07.907 --> 30:08.878
(Passengers scream)

30:08.879 --> 30:11.179
Carla dies in the crash,

30:11.180 --> 30:13.141
but her accomplice doesn't.

30:13.142 --> 30:14.883
He comes here to the morgue,

30:14.884 --> 30:16.584
cuts open her
stomach, gets the stash,

30:16.585 --> 30:18.416
and tries to cover their tracks.

30:18.417 --> 30:19.988
Well, then whoever
it was that did this

30:19.989 --> 30:22.921
is sitting right outside...

30:22.922 --> 30:24.552
And we've interrogated
them already.

30:24.553 --> 30:26.855
But you didn't know
what you were looking for.

30:26.856 --> 30:29.258
Yeah, and you didn't have me.

30:33.262 --> 30:34.432
It's not working.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.435
Nothing you're doing is working.

30:37.937 --> 30:40.138
(Exhales)

30:40.139 --> 30:42.270
(Click, generator whirs) What?!

30:42.271 --> 30:44.312
Black-gyver, you really
did it! Hell, yeah! Aah!

30:44.313 --> 30:45.844
Oh! Ooh! Ha!

30:47.877 --> 30:50.950
(Murmuring)

30:54.853 --> 30:56.424
(Object thuds) Is
this really necessary?

30:56.425 --> 30:58.626
(Adam) Yes, it is.

30:58.627 --> 31:00.428
Okay. (Keys jangle)

31:00.429 --> 31:01.589
Okay, here you go.

31:01.590 --> 31:02.931
(Hands hit tabletop)

31:02.932 --> 31:04.934
(Slaps back) You
happy there, pal?

31:09.638 --> 31:11.099
Megan.

31:11.100 --> 31:12.470
Oh, come on, man!
That's not mine.

31:12.471 --> 31:13.972
Roberto Franco... Are
you crazy? Get outta here!

31:13.973 --> 31:17.375
You're under arrest for
the possession of narcotics.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.948
You have the right
to remain silent.

31:19.949 --> 31:21.209
Anything you say

31:21.210 --> 31:22.580
can and will be held
against you in a court of law.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.882
You have the
right to an attorney.

31:24.883 --> 31:28.086
You know, it doesn't really
matter that he's been caught.

31:28.087 --> 31:29.488
My wife is still dead.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.671
Yeah, we're fine, mom.

31:43.672 --> 31:46.534
We slept through
it mostly, actually.

31:46.535 --> 31:48.536
Will I be seeing you soon?

31:48.537 --> 31:50.038
Okay.

31:50.039 --> 31:51.380
Bye.

31:53.582 --> 31:55.945
She didn't want to talk to you.

31:57.116 --> 31:58.947
(Inhales deeply)

31:58.948 --> 32:00.249
Okay.

32:03.352 --> 32:06.625
Like daughter,
like granddaughter?

32:09.328 --> 32:12.060
You asked me a question
last night. I snapped at you.

32:12.061 --> 32:13.231
It's okay.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.502
No, it's not okay.

32:14.503 --> 32:15.964
You asked me why

32:15.965 --> 32:18.236
I didn't want to know
the truth about granddad.

32:18.237 --> 32:21.539
It's because I already do.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.011
He killed himself.

32:23.012 --> 32:26.614
Do I have all the answers? No.

32:26.615 --> 32:28.616
But I had to move on.

32:28.617 --> 32:32.981
And your mother is having
a very tough time doing that.

32:32.982 --> 32:35.453
And I understand.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.455
I did, too.

32:37.456 --> 32:41.959
I loved your granddad very much.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.293
But if I didn't move forward,
I never would've studied law,

32:45.294 --> 32:47.595
I wouldn't have become a judge,

32:47.596 --> 32:49.267
I wouldn't have...

32:49.268 --> 32:53.041
Or introduced mom to a handsome
young lawyer in your courtroom,

32:53.042 --> 32:54.543
and I wouldn't exist.

32:56.305 --> 32:57.605
(Inhales deeply)

32:57.606 --> 33:02.650
You are an old soul,

33:02.651 --> 33:08.386
and you would
never, ever not exist.

33:08.387 --> 33:13.691
Okay, tell me if this hurts. (Dunn) Come
on, Max. Let's go find that purse, huh?

33:13.692 --> 33:16.324
She's good with kids.

33:16.325 --> 33:17.725
How long have you
two been dating?

33:17.726 --> 33:19.697
Uh, we're not dating.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.769
Why the hell not?

33:21.770 --> 33:23.631
She likes you.

33:23.632 --> 33:26.104
It's complicated.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.005
Hmm.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.608
Does "complicated" have a name?

33:30.609 --> 33:32.580
Yeah.

33:32.581 --> 33:33.741
What is it?

33:33.742 --> 33:35.143
Megan.

33:35.144 --> 33:37.745
Let me give you a bit
of unsolicited advice.

33:37.746 --> 33:40.588
Uncomplicate it.

33:40.589 --> 33:43.351
And if you can't, move on.

33:43.352 --> 33:46.324
You mean, just... settle?

33:46.325 --> 33:47.695
No.

33:47.696 --> 33:49.797
Be happy.

33:49.798 --> 33:51.759
Life's too short.

33:51.760 --> 33:55.633
(Dunn) I found your purse,
right where you said it would be.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.265
And your phone works, too.

33:57.266 --> 33:59.737
Oh, great. Who
should we call first?

33:59.738 --> 34:01.809
(Breathes deeply) (Beeping)

34:01.810 --> 34:03.741
(Pours liquid)

34:03.742 --> 34:06.174
(Cell phone rings)

34:06.175 --> 34:07.345
(Cup clatters) (Ring)

34:07.346 --> 34:08.776
Huh. Phones are back on?

34:08.777 --> 34:10.078
What?

34:10.079 --> 34:11.579
(Ring)

34:11.580 --> 34:13.081
That's... That's
my wife's number.

34:13.082 --> 34:18.656
How... how is my wife
calling your number? (Ring)

34:18.657 --> 34:20.458
Hey. Hey!

34:20.459 --> 34:24.562
Oh, my god. Look at you.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.735
Wait. Look at... you. W...
are you okay? What's wrong?

34:27.736 --> 34:29.297
Yeah, we're... we're
okay. We're fine.

34:29.298 --> 34:30.568
Who's "we"?

34:30.569 --> 34:32.300
Wait. Uh, hey, I'm
sorry to interrupt here,

34:32.301 --> 34:35.303
but you have my wife's
my phone. Is she there?

34:35.304 --> 34:36.474
Yeah.

34:36.475 --> 34:39.177
(Tommy exhales
sharply and grunts)

34:39.178 --> 34:40.348
(Voice breaks) Alex.

34:40.349 --> 34:44.752
(Voice breaks) Pammy!
Pam, oh, my god. Hi.

34:44.753 --> 34:47.815
Alex... I'm so sorry.

34:47.816 --> 34:51.088
(Crying) I'm so sorry
about everything.

34:51.089 --> 34:54.222
No, baby. No, I'm the one
who's sorry. I'm so sorry.

34:54.223 --> 34:55.823
(Grunts and gags)

34:55.824 --> 34:57.725
I... Pam.

34:57.726 --> 34:59.827
Pam! What... what's
going on? What's wrong?

34:59.828 --> 35:01.569
(Tommy) She's starting to shake.

35:01.570 --> 35:03.671
Tommy, try to hold her. Put...
Put the phone on her injuries.

35:03.672 --> 35:05.633
Mm. Here. (Groans)

35:05.634 --> 35:07.675
(Grunts)

35:07.676 --> 35:09.207
Her pulse, it's... it's racing.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.378
She's in v-tach.

35:10.379 --> 35:11.679
Does... does your wife
have heart problems?

35:11.680 --> 35:13.181
Uh, yeah. She's got
a murmur, but she's...

35:13.182 --> 35:14.682
She's on medication for it.

35:14.683 --> 35:16.744
Max, bring me that,
please. (Wheezes)

35:16.745 --> 35:18.546
Thank you.

35:18.547 --> 35:19.617
(Objects clatter)

35:19.618 --> 35:20.788
(Pills rattle)

35:20.789 --> 35:22.820
Uh, dig-oxin? Digoxin.

35:22.821 --> 35:24.622
0.24 milligrams. Oral.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.154
Get her to take two pills.

35:26.155 --> 35:27.795
(Pills rattling) (Grunts)

35:27.796 --> 35:29.727
(Gasping) Megan, she
can't swallow anything.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.859
She's choking on her own blood.
I don't think she can breathe.

35:31.860 --> 35:33.531
Her airway's blocked.

35:33.532 --> 35:35.563
Tommy, you're gonna have to
do an emergency tracheotomy.

35:35.564 --> 35:38.566
No! Absolutely not! He... he's
not a doctor. He can't do this.

35:38.567 --> 35:42.170
You're gonna need a knife
and... And find a ball-point pen.

35:42.171 --> 35:43.341
I got a pen.

35:43.342 --> 35:44.642
Take the ink stem out.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.913
Feel her neck, the
ridges in her neck.

35:45.914 --> 35:47.645
There are two bumps.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.648
I need you to hit right
between those bumps.

35:50.649 --> 35:53.721
One cut, horizontal,

35:53.722 --> 35:55.883
1 inch long, 1 inch deep,
right into the trachea.

35:55.884 --> 35:58.726
(Breathing heavily)

35:58.727 --> 35:59.727
Do it.

36:02.331 --> 36:04.292
(Sighs) Okay.

36:04.293 --> 36:05.733
Okay, now take your finger,

36:05.734 --> 36:06.934
widen the hole,

36:06.935 --> 36:08.336
take the pen,

36:08.337 --> 36:10.298
push it down slowly
towards her lung.

36:10.299 --> 36:11.440
That's it.

36:13.372 --> 36:14.642
Okay, it's in.

36:14.643 --> 36:15.803
Okay.

36:15.804 --> 36:17.505
It's not working.
She's not breathing.

36:17.506 --> 36:19.176
Why? Why... why
isn't she breathing?

36:19.177 --> 36:21.909
(Gasps)

36:21.910 --> 36:24.652
She's breathing.
(Breathing raspily)

36:24.653 --> 36:25.783
She's breathing.

36:25.784 --> 36:28.416
Good. Good job.

36:28.417 --> 36:29.787
Good to see you both alive.

36:29.788 --> 36:30.958
(Chuckles)

36:30.959 --> 36:32.691
Phew! (Chuckles) Thank you.

36:34.593 --> 36:35.724
(Exhales sharply)

36:40.699 --> 36:43.671
Megan? So I was able to radio
one of my old friends in vice.

36:43.672 --> 36:46.504
He says there's been talk of a
shipment coming from overseas.

36:46.505 --> 36:49.807
We could be dealing
with a major cartel.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.379
What?

36:51.380 --> 36:54.312
He's alive. (Chuckles)

36:54.313 --> 36:55.484
And safe.

37:00.919 --> 37:03.721
Hey. I'm gonna hitch a ride
out to the second crash site.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.823
You need me? No.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.295
Uh, I just nailed down

37:07.296 --> 37:08.556
the drug that knocked
out our air marshal friend.

37:08.557 --> 37:09.727
Digoxin.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.499
Weird. Digoxin?

37:11.500 --> 37:13.861
That's the same drug the
flight attendant was taking

37:13.862 --> 37:16.334
for her heart condition.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.637
She's the one who
drugged the air marshal.

37:20.439 --> 37:21.709
I-I just saved the life

37:21.710 --> 37:23.942
of the person who
brought down the plane.

37:30.849 --> 37:32.320
So you're saying

37:32.321 --> 37:35.353
the flight attendant was
really the drug runner?

37:35.354 --> 37:36.984
Right, and Carla
Mendez was her mule.

37:36.985 --> 37:39.357
(Megan) The air marshal
catches on to Carla

37:39.358 --> 37:40.858
and informs the
flight attendant.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.390
(Both speaking indistinctly)
He asks her to radio ahead

37:42.391 --> 37:43.731
and call the cops,

37:43.732 --> 37:47.695
not realizing that Pam
is in on the whole thing.

37:47.696 --> 37:49.737
Pam panics. She
has to neutralize him.

37:49.738 --> 37:50.898
Enjoy.

37:50.899 --> 37:52.300
So she drugs him
with her heart meds,

37:52.301 --> 37:55.403
hoping to knock him out
or maybe even kill him.

37:55.404 --> 37:57.004
(Stafford) But digoxin given in high
enough dosages... (Passengers screaming)

37:57.005 --> 37:58.946
Causes violent hallucinations.

37:58.947 --> 38:00.308
Air marshal goes mad,

38:00.309 --> 38:02.279
shoots up the
plane, brings it down.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.012
So this guy Roberto Franco
that you have in custody...

38:05.013 --> 38:07.685
He's what? A, uh, a
backup drug handler?

38:07.686 --> 38:10.518
No. Two drug
handlers for one mule?

38:10.519 --> 38:11.859
It's unlikely.

38:11.860 --> 38:13.521
You know, Pam's husband told me

38:13.522 --> 38:15.493
that she wanted to
quit flying two years ago,

38:15.494 --> 38:17.495
but he made her keep working.

38:17.496 --> 38:20.728
What do you bet that
he's her accomplice

38:20.729 --> 38:22.700
and he framed Roberto Franco?

38:22.701 --> 38:24.372
The survivors,
have they left yet?

38:24.373 --> 38:25.873
Yeah, just now.

38:25.874 --> 38:28.877
Oh, uh, I'll call security.

38:37.015 --> 38:40.718
Alex Jacks? Alex
Jacks, hold it there.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.650
What's this all about?

38:42.651 --> 38:46.424
I believed every word that
you said to me upstairs...

38:46.425 --> 38:47.655
About loving your wife,

38:47.656 --> 38:48.926
regretting choices
that you made.

38:48.927 --> 38:50.928
If you'd only let her
retire two years ago...

38:50.929 --> 38:52.430
Not from flying,

38:52.431 --> 38:54.031
but from drug running,
which you failed to mention...

38:54.032 --> 38:58.065
53 people would
still be alive today.

38:58.066 --> 38:59.407
What are you talking about?

38:59.408 --> 39:01.569
You must work for
some really scary people.

39:01.570 --> 39:04.612
Your wife could've been
in pieces for all you knew,

39:04.613 --> 39:05.813
but you still had to retrieve

39:05.814 --> 39:08.115
whatever's in that
bag right there.

39:08.116 --> 39:10.618
Was that your
idea or your boss'?

39:10.619 --> 39:12.451
All right.

39:16.485 --> 39:18.026
Uhh! Ooh! Uhh!

39:20.459 --> 39:21.989
(Grunting)

39:21.990 --> 39:23.791
Uhh! (Groans)

39:23.792 --> 39:25.493
(Man speaks indistinctly)

39:25.494 --> 39:26.764
(Metal clatters)

39:26.765 --> 39:29.567
I didn't want any
of this to happen.

39:29.568 --> 39:30.738
(Sighs)

39:30.739 --> 39:32.670
I just wanted the
guy to pass out.

39:32.671 --> 39:35.673
I didn't mean to kill anyone.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.905
Yeah, well, even if things
had worked out as planned,

39:37.906 --> 39:40.948
$2 million worth of drugs
weren't gonna help anybody.

39:40.949 --> 39:43.051
You made some bad choices.

39:47.816 --> 39:48.957
(Handcuff clicks)

39:53.722 --> 39:54.893
(Sighs)

39:57.466 --> 40:01.098
Well, Max is off to
meet his granddad,

40:01.099 --> 40:03.872
and our limo awaits.

40:09.938 --> 40:11.939
Headed out to the crash site?

40:11.940 --> 40:14.682
No, the hospital or
the police station...

40:14.683 --> 40:16.914
Wherever they took
the flight attendant.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.916
And Tommy.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.117
(Exhales)

40:20.118 --> 40:21.919
And Tommy.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.991
Okay, let me guess. I'm, uh...

40:23.992 --> 40:26.454
Not gonna get a rain
check on that dinner, huh?

40:26.455 --> 40:29.426
Eh, I don't think so, Charlie.

40:29.427 --> 40:32.700
Yeah, I kinda figured that
story of yours wasn't over yet.

40:32.701 --> 40:35.102
(Breathes deeply)

40:35.103 --> 40:38.105
Oh. I, uh, was gonna wait
till the madness passed

40:38.106 --> 40:41.670
to, uh, give you this,
but... here you go.

40:45.143 --> 40:47.875
Order of exhumation,

40:47.876 --> 40:49.817
for my father.

40:49.818 --> 40:51.849
It's what you said you wanted.

40:51.850 --> 40:55.052
Thank you.

40:55.053 --> 40:57.154
Megan, sometimes it's, uh,

40:57.155 --> 41:00.128
it's better to leave
the past in the past.

41:02.030 --> 41:03.191
I don't want to.

41:05.594 --> 41:07.765
(Elevator bell dings)

41:07.766 --> 41:10.098
Is Tommy Sullivan still...

41:11.840 --> 41:13.902
I see him.

41:16.905 --> 41:20.648
Hey. I got a squaddie
parked out back.

41:20.649 --> 41:21.979
You ready?

41:21.980 --> 41:23.611
You look great.

41:23.612 --> 41:24.782
Thank you.

41:24.783 --> 41:26.584
Give me the keys. (Keys jangle)

41:26.585 --> 41:28.155
Ah, no. One car wreck
a day with you is my limit.

41:28.156 --> 41:31.089
All right.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.493
(Sighs deeply)

41:36.825 --> 41:38.496
(Sighs) Hmm.
