[no sound]

00:08.119 --> 00:10.000
[no sound]

00:10.080 --> 00:12.760
I can't... I can't hear you.
Press the button.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.239
I can't hear you.
Press the button, you donut.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.880
-I can't hear you.
-It's Clem Fandango, can you hear me?

00:19.960 --> 00:21.640
Yeah, obviously if you press the button.

00:21.720 --> 00:24.360
What's your problem?
You've only worked here for three years.

00:24.440 --> 00:25.840
Temper, temper, Steven.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.160
Don't you "temper, temper" me, boy.
Just do your job.

00:28.240 --> 00:31.080
OK, Steven.
Now the client was very, very specific

00:31.160 --> 00:34.320
about the style of the read and the
pronunciation of some of the words.

00:34.400 --> 00:35.520
Clem's got it in front of him.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.120
-We'll take it from here.
-All right.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.240
Steven, this is Clem Fandango.
Can you hear me?

00:39.320 --> 00:41.040
You are a fucking star, aren't you?

00:42.080 --> 00:43.520
-Yes!
-OK, so this is important.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.560
The client has expressed
that he'd like you to...

00:45.640 --> 00:46.640
-[click]
-[no sound]

00:46.720 --> 00:48.560
Fucking hell,
you've done it again, you cunt.

00:48.640 --> 00:49.760
Press the button!

00:50.480 --> 00:52.520
I can't hear you
unless you push the button!

00:54.960 --> 00:56.800
Steven, this is Clem Fandango,
can you hear me?

00:56.880 --> 00:58.440
I dare you to say that one more time.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.360
Yes, I can hear you. Can you hear me?

01:02.120 --> 01:04.519
Yeah, well, then keep your finger
on the fucking button.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.560
I didn't catch a word of that, all right?

01:06.640 --> 01:10.560
And I need to hear again exactly how
that client wants me to say this script.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.040
OK, Steven, so this is important.

01:12.120 --> 01:15.360
The client expressed they'd like you to
stress certain words within the script.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.520
-OK.
-The words they'd like you to stress are--

01:17.600 --> 01:18.960
-[click]
-[no sound]

01:19.040 --> 01:21.240
[high-pitched scream]

01:52.120 --> 01:53.560
[sighs]

02:07.520 --> 02:10.199
[Ed] It's a little inappropriate
at the breakfast table, Davison.

02:10.280 --> 02:13.280
-Maybe you could do it in your room.
-All right. All right.

02:13.360 --> 02:16.160
Also, this wine-making equipment.
There's rather a lot of it.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.480
Yeah, what the hell is it?

02:18.560 --> 02:19.920
[bubbling]

02:29.680 --> 02:30.680
Try this, Toast.

02:30.760 --> 02:32.360
It's splendid.

02:32.440 --> 02:35.200
Bloody hell, Davison.
It's not even eight o'clock yet.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Well, all right.

02:39.840 --> 02:43.280
-[horror music]
-[gasps]

02:43.760 --> 02:44.920
[splutters]

02:45.000 --> 02:46.400
[vomits]

02:47.040 --> 02:48.120
[coughs]

02:48.200 --> 02:50.600
-You're meant to sip it.
-What the hell is that?

02:50.680 --> 02:52.680
I call it The Black Death.

02:52.760 --> 02:55.680
It's just got that extra edge. 25% proof.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.240
You could clean a car with that.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.280
You can't give this to anyone.
You'll kill them!

02:59.760 --> 03:01.880
And could you do the washing-up,
Davison, old chap?

03:01.960 --> 03:03.680
-It's your turn.
-[Davison] Good God, Ed.

03:03.760 --> 03:08.400
All right! Do you mind if I have
a Jimmy Riddle first? Is that OK?

03:12.240 --> 03:13.360
[door slams]

03:13.440 --> 03:16.560
I'm sorry, Ed, but Davison's
really starting to get on my pip.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.880
Mine too. He's constantly complaining.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.120
Said earlier that the towels
weren't soft enough.

03:21.200 --> 03:24.640
That's nonsense. That new
fabric conditioner we've been using

03:24.720 --> 03:26.800
has left the towels
delightfully soft and fluffy.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.560
I know.
But they're not good enough for Davison.

03:29.640 --> 03:30.680
Why is he even here?

03:30.760 --> 03:33.160
Well, his wife kicked him out
after she caught him on the job.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.520
[laughs loudly] Who with?

03:34.600 --> 03:37.760
Shh. A young dancer.
Northerner. Rough, visceral type.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.600
-Ooh.
-Not someone you'd expect at all.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.640
But, you know, love is strange.

03:41.720 --> 03:44.440
Yeah, talking of which,

03:44.520 --> 03:46.760
how's it going with...
what's her name, Penelope?

03:47.160 --> 03:48.400
No, Penvelope.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.600
Penvelope?

03:49.680 --> 03:51.320
Yes, unusual name.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.160
Looks like Penelope
when it's written down,

03:53.240 --> 03:54.720
but there's a V stuck in there.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.160
Anyway, I just call her Pen.

03:56.240 --> 03:58.360
[sobs]

04:00.560 --> 04:01.840
What's up, Toast?

04:01.920 --> 04:04.960
It's nothing.
I just haven't had any action for a while.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.160
-Not like you, Toast.
-I know.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.600
You know, it doesn't do a chap good
to be out of practice.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.600
I'm glad it's going well
with you and what's her name?

04:12.680 --> 04:14.040
-Penvelope.
-Yeah.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.240
You know, she was a finalist
in that really famous

04:16.320 --> 04:18.839
International Beauty Contest for Women
they had in the '70s.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.680
Really? Is that contest still going?

04:20.760 --> 04:22.079
I believe so.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.760
But sadly due to the rise of feminism,

04:23.840 --> 04:26.040
many of these contests
have been driven underground.

04:26.120 --> 04:27.880
-Oh.
-Terrible shame.

04:27.960 --> 04:31.120
My father actually
was on the judging panel in 1972.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.920
Well, now that is a coincidence.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.600
My father was on the judging panel
that year too.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.920
[applause]

04:42.480 --> 04:45.960
Well, we've seen all the girls. Let's go
straight away now over to our judges.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.760
And first we've got the entrepreneur

04:47.880 --> 04:49.640
Rupert Howzer-Black

04:49.720 --> 04:52.560
who made his fortune
from the Whiskers cat food.

04:52.640 --> 04:56.880
So, Rupert, which one
of our gorgeous, beautiful ladies

04:56.960 --> 04:59.000
could lick your saucer clean?

04:59.080 --> 05:01.560
-[audience laughs]
-Well, it's very hard to choose, Dennis.

05:01.640 --> 05:03.080
But I'd have to say that Miss Fiji

05:03.160 --> 05:06.240
performed extremely strongly
in the swimwear section,

05:06.320 --> 05:09.360
which, as you know, is a highly
competitive part of the contest

05:09.440 --> 05:11.640
and I thought she did very, very well.

05:11.720 --> 05:12.600
Thank you, Rupert.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.240
Moving on now to Colonel Gonville Toast.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.080
Good evening to you, Colonel.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.440
-Who do you fancy?
-Well, I think Miss Portugal

05:19.520 --> 05:21.080
might just shade it for me

05:21.160 --> 05:24.160
due to the amount of time
that she donates to charity.

05:24.240 --> 05:28.560
And I'll make sure I give her a handsome
donation of my own after the show.

05:28.640 --> 05:30.200
[audience laughs]

05:30.280 --> 05:31.400
I'm sure you will.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.840
Mmm, yeah.

05:33.920 --> 05:37.360
-How's your donation going, Toast?
-Oh, yes!

05:37.440 --> 05:38.440
[moans]

05:48.200 --> 05:49.280
[phone beeps]

05:49.360 --> 05:51.960
-Oh, what's that, Toast?
-It's a text from Jane.

05:52.040 --> 05:55.240
[tranquil music]

06:00.920 --> 06:01.920
What's it about?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.800
Well, Jane's had a text
from the organizers

06:03.880 --> 06:06.480
of the International Beauty Contest
for Women,

06:06.560 --> 06:09.120
asking if I'd like to judge
at this year's event.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.600
[phone beeps]

06:10.680 --> 06:12.560
Oh, I've also had a text
from the organizers

06:12.640 --> 06:14.840
of the International Beauty Contest
for Women.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.160
They want me to be a judge
at this year's event too.

06:17.240 --> 06:18.320
Yeah, we can go together.

06:19.440 --> 06:22.160
I don't know, Ed. Beauty contests.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.800
They're a bit passÃ©.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.760
They're a bit yesterday's bread.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.200
They're a bit eggnog.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.880
Could be fun though. Tell you what.

06:28.960 --> 06:32.120
I'm seeing Penvelope tonight and she's
bringing a friend along. Like to come?

06:32.200 --> 06:33.640
Pen says that you might fancy her

06:33.720 --> 06:35.680
because she's a weather girl
off the television.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.440
A weather girl? I love weather girls!

06:38.520 --> 06:40.800
-I know you do.
-Which one is she? Sky News?

06:40.880 --> 06:46.480
ITV? Al Jazeera-a-a-a?

06:46.560 --> 06:47.800
She's called Clancy Moped.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.600
I think she works
on a specialist weather channel.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.640
Then count me in.
Even if I don't get to have sex with her,

06:53.720 --> 06:56.320
at least I'll know what next week's
weather is going to be like.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.000
[laughs]

07:01.200 --> 07:02.480
Toast, this is Penvelope.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.160
-She prefers to be called Pen for short.
-[Toast] Hello.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.080
And this is Clancy Moped.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.840
Hello. I'm Steven Toast.

07:12.920 --> 07:16.440
Hello.
Well, this is a nice restaurant, isn't it?

07:16.520 --> 07:18.320
-Lebanese, I believe.
-Lebon-ese.

07:18.400 --> 07:19.800
Oh, not Leban-ese?

07:19.880 --> 07:21.680
No, Lebon-ese.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.240
Remember, Toast,
you once went to a Lebanese restaurant

07:24.320 --> 07:26.800
because you thought
it had something to do with lesbians?

07:28.280 --> 07:30.960
Lebon is a small country
in the Middle East.

07:31.040 --> 07:34.160
-The weather there is actually quite mild.
-[chuckles]

07:34.240 --> 07:36.840
-Ed tells me you're a weather girl.
-[laughs]

07:36.920 --> 07:38.760
Is it that obvious? Ha!

07:40.080 --> 07:41.160
I love the weather.

07:41.240 --> 07:44.240
Mm, well, you must know a lot about it.

07:44.320 --> 07:47.600
So what's the weather like in South Africa
this time of year per example?

07:49.200 --> 07:51.600
Temperatures in South Africa
tend to be a lot lower

07:51.680 --> 07:55.640
than other countries
of similar latitude, such as Australia,

07:55.720 --> 07:59.120
due mainly to the greater elevation
above sea level.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.800
On the interior plateau,
the altitude keeps the... [fades out]

08:04.240 --> 08:07.000
...there is, however, a striking contrast
between temperatures

08:07.080 --> 08:08.800
on the country's east and west coast

08:08.880 --> 08:12.840
due respectively to the warm Agulhas
and cold Benguela currents

08:12.920 --> 08:14.560
that sweep the coast lines.

08:15.280 --> 08:16.760
Fascinating.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.800
I hope I'm not boring you.

08:18.880 --> 08:21.160
Not at all. Not at all.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.200
I do tend to go on
about the weather a lot.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.560
That, and feminism.

08:25.640 --> 08:27.640
-[growls]
-Are you an active feminist?

08:27.720 --> 08:29.440
Oh, very much so, yes.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.360
Mmm, I love feminism.

08:31.440 --> 08:34.960
And I love women.
They're an inspiration to us all.

08:35.039 --> 08:38.679
I mean, you never see a sculpture of a dog
or monkey in an art gallery,

08:38.760 --> 08:40.880
always the bust of a beautiful woman.

08:40.960 --> 08:41.960
[laughs]

08:42.760 --> 08:44.200
I just need to...

08:44.280 --> 08:45.520
Course you do.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.080
-[Clancy] Pen?
-I think she probably needs to go too.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.320
Do you want to come with me?

08:55.280 --> 08:57.120
What do you think of Penvelope, eh, Toast?

08:57.200 --> 08:59.960
Former finalist of the world's
most prestigious beauty contest.

09:00.520 --> 09:02.040
But from what year?

09:02.120 --> 09:04.680
1956, I think. Can't believe my luck.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.200
She looks like she's had a massive stroke.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.200
Massive stroke of good luck for me,
I'd say.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.480
Well, that Clancy's just my type.

09:12.560 --> 09:16.360
She may bang on about the weather a bit,
but she's a cracker and no mistacker.

09:16.440 --> 09:20.360
I'm gonna get the bill and try and wangle
my way back to her place.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.560
What the hell do you think
you're doing? Stop it!

09:22.640 --> 09:24.600
-What?
-That gesture you just made to the waiter.

09:24.680 --> 09:27.760
What, this? Indicating I want the bill.
Everyone knows what that means.

09:27.840 --> 09:30.240
No, no, no, no. In their country,
that gesture means,

09:30.320 --> 09:32.200
"I want to, you know, your mother."

09:32.280 --> 09:33.280
What?

09:35.080 --> 09:36.840
-What is your problem, man?
-What?

09:36.920 --> 09:39.840
Why you make the "I want
to fuck your mother" gesture?

09:39.920 --> 09:43.160
-I didn't, it was... getting the bill.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get out!

09:43.240 --> 09:45.440
-What?
-Get out!

09:46.200 --> 09:47.840
And you can forget the bill.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.440
I don't want your fucking money!

09:50.920 --> 09:51.920
Best leave now, Toast.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
-What about the ladies?
-Just leave now.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.640
[waiter] Masut,
show them the fucking door.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.480
-What the fuck are we watching?
-[scoffs]

10:19.560 --> 10:22.320
[Toast] It's the state funeral
of Winston Churchill.

10:22.400 --> 10:26.080
And happens to be a favorite piece
of archive footage of mine and Ed's.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.040
Oh, splendid. Have I missed much?

10:29.600 --> 10:31.680
-Where have they got to?
-No, you're all right, Ed.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.360
We're still at Whitehall.
Just coming up to The Strand.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.560
Are you two for fucking real?

10:36.640 --> 10:38.880
You fucking prick dickheads.

10:38.960 --> 10:42.360
Wanking, fucking boring
arsehole shit-houses!

10:42.440 --> 10:45.240
Turn it off, man! Fuck's sake.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.800
-There's gotta be something better on.
-She's got a point, Ed.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.800
You're not gonna watch
the whole thing, are you?

10:49.880 --> 10:53.640
I'm sorry, but Toast and I always watch
this footage on the great man's birthday.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.520
And you, Davison, and your lady friend,
are ruining it for us.

10:56.600 --> 11:00.920
Thought you old actors
were meant to be fucking hellraisers!

11:01.000 --> 11:03.840
It's like being round at me nan
and fucking grandpa's!

11:05.240 --> 11:06.240
Right, I'm off.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.320
Apparently, in their country, this...

11:11.320 --> 11:13.280
means something quite rude,

11:13.360 --> 11:16.000
so we had to get out of the restaurant
pretty sharpish.

11:16.080 --> 11:19.520
Anyway, I was wondering if you
would like to go for a drink with me?

11:19.600 --> 11:22.000
-[Clancy]  Yes, please.
-Well, that would be delightful.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.920
OK. All the best and I'll see you then.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.520
Yes-s-s-s!

11:30.400 --> 11:34.520
I have to say, I have no interest
in pop music whatsoever.

11:34.600 --> 11:35.960
Me neither.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.600
-Although I do like some groups.
-Who?

11:38.680 --> 11:41.200
Weather Report. Um... Snow Patrol.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.320
Earth Wind & Fire.
Especially the Wind bit.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.920
-Ooh.
-Oh, and my favorite song

11:45.000 --> 11:46.080
is "Singin' in the Rain".

11:46.160 --> 11:49.520
Is it? I don't know that one,
but it sounds delightful.

11:49.600 --> 11:53.360
These Pussy Riot fellas,
are they a group?

11:53.440 --> 11:54.720
I'm wearing the T-shirt

11:54.800 --> 11:58.520
because I think what Pussy Riot
are doing is really important.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.640
I'm fully behind
their radical feminist agenda

12:00.720 --> 12:03.000
and I'll always turn out
to support them if I can.

12:03.080 --> 12:06.440
Me too. Do you know
what a feminist looks like?

12:06.520 --> 12:08.240
-What?
-This.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.840
[both laugh]

12:11.360 --> 12:12.640
Hmm.

12:12.720 --> 12:17.640
OK, this date. Would you say
things are blowing hot or cold?

12:17.720 --> 12:19.440
What would your forecast be?

12:20.360 --> 12:22.080
I would say hot.

12:22.160 --> 12:24.200
[laughs] So would I.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.640
What say we finish these drinks
and go back to your place?

12:26.720 --> 12:28.880
-Ooh...
-Yes.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.320
Very nice.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.360
-Care for a drink?
-Uh, a glass of red wine please.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.480
-Large or small?
-Large, I think.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.240
Yep.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.840
This is a very weather-themed room.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.040
I was just admiring
your charming selection

12:56.120 --> 12:58.240
-of snow globes.
-[tinkling sound]

12:58.320 --> 13:00.000
Oh, Toast.

13:01.640 --> 13:04.520
-You must have this one as a gift.
-That's very kind.

13:07.560 --> 13:11.760
It may be cold outside, but I am very hot.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.360
Oh, you're a smooth talker, Toast.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.560
But I have something to tell you.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.800
I've never been much good at romance.

13:21.960 --> 13:24.280
I think that's why I try to stick
to the weather.

13:24.360 --> 13:26.920
It's a very British thing.
We can't talk about our emotions,

13:27.000 --> 13:28.160
so we talk about the weather.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.640
When I'm in love, I just fall apart.

13:32.360 --> 13:34.440
I don't know what to do. I lose focus.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.640
Even my hearing goes a bit off.

13:37.720 --> 13:40.960
-[muffled] Don't worry about that shit.
-Why would I worry about bat shit?

13:41.040 --> 13:42.960
[normal voice]
No, not bat shit. That shit.

13:43.040 --> 13:45.840
Sorry, I'm completely losing it now.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.960
It's all because... I love...

13:48.840 --> 13:49.760
Oh, I can't.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.600
You're only man I've ever met...

13:52.680 --> 13:54.440
I can't be the only man you've ever met.

13:54.520 --> 13:58.400
...who doesn't mind me blathering on
about feminism topics or the weather.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.120
I don't mind at all.

14:02.120 --> 14:05.040
[theatrical voice] As the warmth
of the day makes way

14:05.120 --> 14:07.920
for the cool embrace of the night,

14:08.000 --> 14:11.800
let us throw caution to the wi-ind.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.280
Oh, that's lovely.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.320
[tinkling sound]

14:25.360 --> 14:28.360
Well, I thoroughly enjoyed that.

14:31.440 --> 14:32.840
Are you free tomorrow?

14:35.800 --> 14:39.040
She is lovely, and the sex is superb.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.040
Straight down to it, over in seconds.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.600
-A quick park?
-A quick park.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.760
No foreplay.
Just the way the ladies like it.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.880
Anyway, I gotta split.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.760
Got a bloody voiceover.
Shouldn't take too long.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.600
Then I'm seeing the lovely Clancy

14:52.680 --> 14:55.360
where the outlook
looks very promising indeed.

14:55.440 --> 14:58.720
-You think so?
-Yes-s-s.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.080
[thunder]

15:02.160 --> 15:05.320
"So if your broadband connection
is slowing you down,

15:05.400 --> 15:08.240
try Thunderbolt Ultra-Fast Broadband."

15:09.080 --> 15:10.920
OK, Steven.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.360
Toast! I couldn't wait
until tonight to see you.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.200
I think you're top class!

15:16.280 --> 15:17.360
Clancy!

15:28.840 --> 15:31.640
Damn this glass
for getting in the way of our love!

15:37.560 --> 15:38.680
[Danny] Sorry, Steven.

15:38.760 --> 15:41.840
Really do need to crack on
with this broadband voiceover.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.000
Won't be long.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.320
Go back to your flat, Clancy.
Break open the champagne.

15:50.840 --> 15:54.640
I'll be right with you
after I've dealt with these two arseholes.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.080
[Toast] Are we rolling?

16:01.160 --> 16:04.120
"So if your broadband connection
is slowing you down,

16:04.200 --> 16:06.800
try Thunderbolt Ultra-Fast Broadband."

16:09.280 --> 16:11.080
-Just one more.
-[sighs]

16:11.920 --> 16:15.080
[Toast] "So if your broadband connection
is slowing you down..."

16:16.680 --> 16:17.920
[owl hoots]

16:24.160 --> 16:27.640
"So if your broadband connection
is slowing you down,

16:27.720 --> 16:30.760
try Thunderbolt Ultra-Fast Broadband."

16:33.480 --> 16:34.800
-One more?
-[sighs]

16:41.760 --> 16:42.800
Good morning, Emma.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.760
[mimics] "Good morning, Emma."
Fucking tool.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.840
[clattering]

16:48.920 --> 16:50.280
[loud metallic crash]

16:51.160 --> 16:53.320
Davison, the washing-up
really needs to be done.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.960
Yes, I'll do it.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.360
We just need to make
another batch of wine first.

16:59.440 --> 17:03.320
Fucking top shit. Right, we're off to
Boots to get some more bottles and gear.

17:03.400 --> 17:07.440
-And don't forget--
-The washing-up. Yes!

17:10.920 --> 17:13.800
Thank goodness we're getting out
of here for the beauty contest today.

17:13.880 --> 17:16.880
-Some relief from those two.
-Yeah.

17:16.960 --> 17:20.480
Shit, the weather's on.
I need to see Clancy.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.520
I missed her last night.

17:22.599 --> 17:26.000
Those idiots at Scramble Studios
made me work late.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.440
There'll be a cold front...

17:27.520 --> 17:29.560
-Ah.
-...coming in from...

17:32.160 --> 17:34.640
...somewhere. It'll be freezing.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.440
I don't know what I'm doing today.

17:38.520 --> 17:39.680
Huh?

17:40.200 --> 17:45.080
See, my Toasty
said that he would call round last night

17:45.840 --> 17:48.680
and then didn't turn up.

17:48.760 --> 17:49.880
Ooh...

17:49.960 --> 17:54.080
The weather is so unimportant.

17:55.720 --> 17:57.680
No, no, no, Clancy. Don't do that.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.760
I think I'm in love.  [sniffles]

18:01.840 --> 18:04.400
Oh, dear, the poor girl
seems to be somewhat distressed.

18:04.480 --> 18:07.280
That's because she's in love with me.
I mean, who could blame her?

18:08.400 --> 18:10.520
[tinkling sound]

18:13.880 --> 18:17.960
âª Feeling hot but it's cold outside âª

18:18.560 --> 18:22.480
âª The weather's changeable
but I don't mind âª

18:22.920 --> 18:26.600
âª A gift from God sent from heaven above âª

18:27.200 --> 18:30.720
âª You could be right
when you say I'm in love âª

18:30.800 --> 18:35.400
âª I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in lo-ove âª

18:35.480 --> 18:39.360
âª He's in love, he's in love,
he's in love âª

18:39.960 --> 18:44.560
âª I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in lo-ove âª

18:44.640 --> 18:49.560
âª He's in love, he's in love,
he's in love âª

18:57.720 --> 18:59.120
[car horn honks]

18:59.200 --> 19:01.280
Ah, that'll be the car
for the beauty contest.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.560
Why are we going so early?

19:02.640 --> 19:05.640
Oh, I imagine there'll be a luncheon
or some lavish reception beforehand.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.480
[sighs] All right.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.560
International Beauty Contest?

19:13.480 --> 19:14.800
-Yes?
-Yeah, jump in then.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.120
One of you
will have to get in the back, though.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.000
No, you've gotta be kidding.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.160
[car door creaks]

19:33.960 --> 19:36.360
[cage rattles]

19:39.840 --> 19:40.920
[phone rings]

19:42.760 --> 19:44.200
[Toast]  Where the hell are we going?

19:44.280 --> 19:47.080
We've been traveling for six hours.
I'm freezing!

19:47.160 --> 19:49.200
Yes, driver. Where exactly are we going?

19:49.280 --> 19:51.520
I can't tell you that, mate.
The feminists might find out

19:51.600 --> 19:53.280
then we'd have a shit-storm,
wouldn't we?

19:55.040 --> 19:58.720
Actually, we are a bit early.
I might pull the lamp out.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.720
-Is that OK?
-Lamp? What lamp?

20:00.800 --> 20:03.680
Lamping for rabbits in that field
over there, look. Here you are.

20:05.040 --> 20:08.120
You shoot, right?
I'll lamp and pick up. Nice.

20:16.400 --> 20:17.400
What?

20:20.040 --> 20:21.160
What the hell?

20:23.080 --> 20:24.960
[groans] Jesus!

20:25.040 --> 20:26.480
[groans]

20:27.560 --> 20:30.320
Answer your phone, Ed.
What the hell is going on?

20:37.080 --> 20:38.760
[cockerel crows]

20:39.920 --> 20:40.920
[Ed] Sorry, Toast.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.400
They used to hold these things
in The Dorchester.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.320
Right, gentlemen,
I think we should get started

20:49.400 --> 20:50.680
as soon as possible. Don't you?

20:50.760 --> 20:53.320
Now wait a minute, where's the organizer?
We should talk to him.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.480
I'm the organizer, mate, Vic Titball.

20:55.560 --> 20:58.040
Thanks for agreeing to judge
this year's contest.

20:58.120 --> 21:01.280
I know you said these beauty contests
have been driven underground,

21:01.360 --> 21:02.640
but this is ridiculous.

21:02.720 --> 21:03.960
Looks more like a dogfight.

21:04.040 --> 21:06.080
Right, let's get the girls in.

21:06.160 --> 21:08.280
Ah, the girls. Where are they?

21:08.360 --> 21:10.240
They're outside in a van.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.720
'Cause it's a bit cramped in here,
we're gonna do 'em in batches of three.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.320
[men cheer]

21:18.240 --> 21:20.040
[Vic] Yes, beautiful ladies.

21:20.120 --> 21:25.560
Miss Bulgaria, Miss Romania and Miss...
Where you from again, darling?

21:25.640 --> 21:27.760
-Albania.
-Albania, of course.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.080
Ah, the swimwear round.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.360
-[coughing]
-[cow moos]

21:31.440 --> 21:33.360
[dog barks]

21:34.880 --> 21:38.400
Look, I'm getting out of here, Ed.
This is bullshit. Are you coming?

21:38.480 --> 21:40.040
-[explosion]
-[commotion]

21:40.120 --> 21:43.440
[rock music]

21:45.720 --> 21:47.160
-Who are they?
-Pussy Riot.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.920
[protestors chant]

21:52.600 --> 21:55.400
-Pen?
-Clancy!

21:57.400 --> 21:59.920
Toast. No-o-o!

22:00.000 --> 22:01.240
It's not what it seems!

22:04.480 --> 22:06.640
[Ed] History repeating itself
it would appear, Toast.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.760
Clancy was furious.

22:08.840 --> 22:11.040
I'm truly heartbroken, Ed.
It's all over now.

22:11.560 --> 22:13.480
-[Ed] Such a shame.
-[sighs]

22:13.560 --> 22:16.880
Have you seen Davison and Emma?
Are they back yet?

22:16.960 --> 22:19.520
Davison still hasn't done the washing-up.

22:19.600 --> 22:22.360
I haven't seen them, Ed.
Maybe they're in their room.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.560
[horror music]

22:34.000 --> 22:37.120
I don't think Davison's in a fit state
to do the washing-up, Ed.

22:37.640 --> 22:40.160
All right. It's just you and me then.

22:45.920 --> 22:48.280
-Hm, unbelievable.
-[both laugh]

22:55.640 --> 22:58.320
âª So take my hand âª

22:58.400 --> 23:00.760
âª We'll disappear to a pub âª

23:00.840 --> 23:03.520
âª That's not too far from here âª

23:03.600 --> 23:07.360
âª Though I don't know you
and you don't know me âª

23:07.440 --> 23:11.640
âª I just had to talk to you, you see âª

23:11.720 --> 23:13.280
âª So take my hand âª
