WEBVTT

00:01.850 --> 00:04.639
Yes, sir. I understand completely, sir.

00:04.640 --> 00:06.260
Things go that way sometimes.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.710
Yes, sir, I will. You can count on me.

00:12.520 --> 00:16.129
Kids, come on out. Time
for deployment gifts.

00:16.129 --> 00:17.109
- Coming!
- I'm coming, too!

00:17.110 --> 00:19.250
Photos, videos, and playlists.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.779
Not as good as a warm body in your bed,

00:21.780 --> 00:24.079
but it'll just have to
do till I see you again.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.780
Wait, Ashley. Let me get it!

00:28.050 --> 00:29.819
Darien, I'm not going to the Med.

00:29.820 --> 00:31.560
Navy's sending us to the Arctic.

00:32.070 --> 00:34.070
The Arctic? That's crazy.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.060
Some cold weather test
on a new weapons system.

00:37.100 --> 00:39.650
It's all classified. It's
happening very fast.

00:39.770 --> 00:41.679
We're gonna be at complete radio silence.

00:41.680 --> 00:43.110
No e-mails, no calls.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.240
For how long?

00:45.170 --> 00:48.010
Six months, maybe five.

00:48.510 --> 00:51.299
- Figures.
- It's my last tour for a while.

00:51.300 --> 00:52.819
Then I'll be around the house so much,

00:52.820 --> 00:54.930
you'll be sick of me, I promise.

00:55.720 --> 00:56.720
Sit down.

01:01.150 --> 01:02.740
Did you wrap this yourself?

01:02.760 --> 01:03.760
I did.

01:04.910 --> 01:06.650
It's from the championship game.

01:07.530 --> 01:08.780
Keep it next to your bed.

01:10.100 --> 01:13.550
I love it, buddy. That's really great.

01:14.050 --> 01:15.050
Thank you.

01:21.620 --> 01:23.970
- It's beautiful.
- It's not regulation,

01:24.240 --> 01:26.340
so I know you can't wear it.

01:28.350 --> 01:31.039
How about I keep it in the front pocket

01:31.040 --> 01:32.740
of my uniform right over my heart?

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.440 --> 01:47.710
I need help, if anyone
out there can hear me.

01:47.950 --> 01:49.070
I'm just outside...

01:50.890 --> 01:52.900
I need help, please.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.060
If you can hear me...

02:05.920 --> 02:07.520
I sent the guys on a break.

02:09.009 --> 02:11.660
Figured I'd see what's going
on in the outside world.

02:13.689 --> 02:14.689
It's a lot of static.

02:14.690 --> 02:16.329
Yeah, whatever you might hear out there

02:16.330 --> 02:18.280
is not gonna be particularly uplifting.

02:18.710 --> 02:21.720
Well, my dad had an old ham
radio set in his cabin,

02:22.320 --> 02:24.120
and I thought maybe if Darien was...

02:27.080 --> 02:28.320
It's our anniversary.

02:31.780 --> 02:33.100
You never come down here.

02:33.350 --> 02:34.350
No.

02:35.910 --> 02:37.869
Yeah, I don't think
Christine's looking for me.

02:37.870 --> 02:38.870
Come on.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.730
Before we left, things were
pretty ragged between us.

02:46.170 --> 02:47.289
When I finally got her on the phone

02:47.290 --> 02:51.590
after we lifted EMCON, she...
told me about Lucas.

02:55.890 --> 02:57.360
Losing a son is one thing,

02:58.040 --> 03:00.140
but dealing with it on your own is just...

03:01.330 --> 03:02.880
There was nothing you could do.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.080
That is not what she wanted to hear.

03:08.630 --> 03:09.680
I'll leave you to it.

03:13.450 --> 03:14.960
There's still a chance, Mike.

03:17.690 --> 03:18.730
For all of us.

03:41.720 --> 03:42.720
Jordan!

03:44.290 --> 03:46.050
On the side! Shoot it! Shoot it!

03:46.660 --> 03:47.780
I'm open! I'm open!

03:47.880 --> 03:49.350
- Right here!
- That's what I want.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.549
Come on, Miller. Thought you could hoop.

03:50.550 --> 03:52.170
- Yeah, I can.
- You can, huh?

03:55.760 --> 03:57.360
Oh, man. That was our last ball.

04:00.530 --> 04:01.530
Nice, buddy.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.490
So why Costa Rica?

04:04.720 --> 04:07.570
Dr. Scott's gonna need some
primates to test her vaccine.

04:07.730 --> 04:10.329
Apparently, there's a monkey
reserve a few miles upriver.

04:10.330 --> 04:12.540
She doesn't have the vaccine, does she?

04:12.770 --> 04:15.820
She's working on it.
Meanwhile, we move forward.

04:19.790 --> 04:21.290
You think there'll be a beach?

04:22.130 --> 04:23.980
I could really use a beach right now.

04:26.610 --> 04:28.740
What? What the hell is this?

04:30.170 --> 04:32.309
Wasn't this on the list to be rebuilt?

04:32.310 --> 04:32.940
Yes, sir.

04:32.941 --> 04:34.399
The chief engineer put the HTs on it,

04:34.400 --> 04:35.479
but we're out of spare parts.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.949
They're cobbling everything
together from scratch.

04:36.950 --> 04:38.269
Well, she's laid up in medical bay,

04:38.270 --> 04:39.880
and it's on me now if that gasket blows.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.790
No one gets off watch till it's done.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.540
Does anybody hear that?

04:50.750 --> 04:52.790
- Hear what, sir?
- She's not purring.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.299
This is the messdecks for
the enlisted in here,

05:03.300 --> 05:04.499
although I think you'll
probably take your meals

05:04.500 --> 05:06.200
with the officers in the wardroom.

05:06.620 --> 05:08.389
Man, these are some cramped quarters.

05:08.390 --> 05:09.840
I don't know how y'all do it.

05:10.580 --> 05:12.630
Four months you've been on this ship now?

05:12.900 --> 05:14.870
- Almost five.
- Five? Wow.

05:16.900 --> 05:17.900
Ma'am.

05:21.060 --> 05:24.760
She is tasty.

05:24.770 --> 05:25.770
Now is she not?

05:25.990 --> 05:27.980
Oh, lighten up, dude. I'm just saying.

05:28.490 --> 05:30.200
It's the end of the world, right?

05:30.340 --> 05:32.840
Nothing wrong with spreading
a little love around,

05:33.320 --> 05:35.770
- and I ain't navy, so...
- Yeah, well, they are,

05:35.980 --> 05:38.440
which means no fraternizing, period.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.059
Oh, I get it. I get it.

05:40.060 --> 05:42.600
Hey, um... Where is the lab?

05:43.380 --> 05:45.039
Maybe pay a visit to that scientist.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.060
She's a civilian, right?

05:48.270 --> 05:49.871
I can't believe I have to bunk with you.

05:49.960 --> 05:51.310
Seriously, where's the lab?

06:21.960 --> 06:23.679
I need to complete the sequence analysis

06:23.680 --> 06:25.279
of the three known virus strains...

06:25.280 --> 06:26.549
primordial, Egyptian,

06:26.550 --> 06:28.529
and the sample that I extracted
from the cruise ship.

06:28.530 --> 06:30.239
You do what you gotta do,
but you do it alone.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.689
I'm not letting him back in that lab.

06:31.690 --> 06:33.339
Believe me, Quincy is the last person

06:33.340 --> 06:35.640
that I wanna see right now, but I need him.

06:36.550 --> 06:38.390
And we're right on the verge here.

06:38.980 --> 06:41.320
That man tried to infect this entire ship.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.740
You're not listening to me.

06:44.950 --> 06:47.730
This is one procedure
that I cannot do alone.

06:48.020 --> 06:49.280
What about Doc Rios?

06:49.390 --> 06:52.210
I am sure that he is an
excellent ship's doctor,

06:53.320 --> 06:55.899
but I need a highly trained
expert in bioinformatics

06:55.900 --> 06:57.020
just for a few hours.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.189
I promise that I won't
let him near anything

06:59.190 --> 07:00.640
that could endanger the ship.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.520
What do you want?

07:19.900 --> 07:21.430
I managed the sequencing.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.170
All three strains.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.350
Wasn't sure that I was
gonna be able to do it

07:27.360 --> 07:29.710
with the equipment on
hand, but the data is in.

07:30.490 --> 07:32.210
And you need me to analyze it.

07:34.260 --> 07:35.260
Yes.

07:38.640 --> 07:42.499
Look, Quincy, I am sorry for
you and for your family,

07:42.500 --> 07:45.040
for... Kelly.

07:45.570 --> 07:47.090
And Ava, of course.

07:47.580 --> 07:48.969
And I know there's nothing that I can say,

07:48.970 --> 07:50.739
but I also know that you understand

07:50.740 --> 07:51.879
that the world needs us right now...

07:51.880 --> 07:53.960
Please don't preach to me, Rachel.

07:54.700 --> 07:56.609
I've had it up to here
with your high-mindedness.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.760
- I'm not preaching.
- The world needs you,

07:58.930 --> 08:00.129
and that's just the way you like it.

08:00.130 --> 08:01.119
Quincy, what are you talking about?

08:01.120 --> 08:02.369
I know that you're in pain here,

08:02.370 --> 08:03.569
- but there's nothing...
- I told you...

08:03.570 --> 08:06.500
I told you we should share our information,

08:06.510 --> 08:09.079
that sneaking off to the Arctic
wasn't the way to do this,

08:09.080 --> 08:10.669
but you loved the whole "Top secret" thing.

08:10.670 --> 08:11.599
That's not fair, because we both agreed...

08:11.600 --> 08:12.619
You had to go it alone...

08:12.620 --> 08:13.949
...this was the only way we
knew what we were doing.

08:13.950 --> 08:14.859
...and show everyone how smart you are.

08:14.860 --> 08:16.179
Quincy, where is this coming from?

08:16.180 --> 08:19.080
This plague is the best thing
that's ever happened to you.

08:19.210 --> 08:20.949
Rachel Scott saves the day.

08:20.950 --> 08:23.770
- This is not my fault.
- No, it's mine...

08:26.700 --> 08:27.780
...for following you.

08:30.350 --> 08:32.280
I mean, what were you risking, really?

08:33.390 --> 08:36.409
You've got no family.
You've got no friends.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.700
Truth is, you don't have
any skin in the game.

08:42.289 --> 08:45.210
You have no idea what I have lost.

08:45.480 --> 08:48.100
The guy who pops into town
for a twice-monthly screw

08:48.110 --> 08:49.110
doesn't count.

08:50.140 --> 08:51.829
You don't know about loss

08:51.830 --> 08:54.340
because you don't care
about anyone but yourself.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.579
Where the hell do you get
off thinking your pain

08:56.580 --> 08:58.280
is any greater than anyone else's?

08:58.960 --> 09:00.779
There's a whole ship
full of people out there

09:00.780 --> 09:02.069
who've lost just as much as you,

09:02.070 --> 09:04.850
and yet they keep finding a
way to march on, but you...

09:08.780 --> 09:09.970
you're a coward.

09:10.900 --> 09:11.900
Nothing more.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.500
Probably a great deal less.

09:21.560 --> 09:24.050
Diplomacy's not necessarily
your strong suit.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.330
I can't even look at him.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.899
Well, you said you can't do it without him,

09:27.900 --> 09:28.709
so one way or another,

09:28.710 --> 09:30.910
we're gonna have to get
him on board, right?

09:31.510 --> 09:33.880
You do it. You talk to him.

09:35.180 --> 09:37.030
I'm not that good with people anyw...

09:38.000 --> 09:39.100
What on earth is that?

09:39.840 --> 09:41.549
Bridge, this is M.P.A.

09:41.550 --> 09:44.169
We've got high temperature on
number 1 and 2 generators.

09:44.170 --> 09:45.930
Commencing stage one load-shed.

09:53.380 --> 09:55.529
Tell captain Chandler that
we need A/C and power,

09:55.530 --> 09:57.799
or everything will be lost, and hurry!

09:57.800 --> 09:59.240
- Right away.
- Damn it.

10:01.510 --> 10:03.210
No, that's not it. Trace the line.

10:03.989 --> 10:04.989
We can't run at this temperature.

10:04.990 --> 10:05.869
We're gonna overheat!

10:05.870 --> 10:08.520
Pull the filters. Let's see
what's going on in there.

10:10.740 --> 10:13.240
Damn it!

10:16.519 --> 10:17.519
Fire, fire, fire.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.369
Class bravo fire, main engine room two.

10:19.370 --> 10:22.020
Away the at-sea fire party,
provide from repair five.

10:22.540 --> 10:24.740
D.C.A., it's the captain.
What's the status?

10:24.940 --> 10:27.340
I say again, D.C.A., what is the status?

10:35.800 --> 10:38.680
Mr. Chung! Everybody okay?

10:39.470 --> 10:41.820
- Yes, sir. The fire's out.
- What's our sitrep?

10:41.830 --> 10:44.530
It started in the seawater
service system intake, sir.

10:44.870 --> 10:46.510
Something must have torn off the filters,

10:46.810 --> 10:48.129
and sea life bloom got in...

10:48.130 --> 10:50.569
That's on me. We cut it a little
tight getting out of Gitmo.

10:50.570 --> 10:53.370
Corals must have knocked off the filters.
How bad is it?

10:53.810 --> 10:56.940
It's too soon to tell, sir,
but with the intakes down,

10:57.440 --> 11:00.010
we've lost our ability to cool
the engine oil for the mains.

11:00.140 --> 11:02.669
What about the generators?
Did they survive?

11:02.670 --> 11:03.980
Just generator three, sir,

11:04.140 --> 11:06.440
and we're lucky it was
offline during the time.

11:06.490 --> 11:09.299
I want all the electricity
diverted to the C.I.C.

11:09.300 --> 11:10.489
and Dr. Scott's lab.

11:10.490 --> 11:13.950
Under any circumstance, she
needs that room cooled.

11:14.040 --> 11:17.069
- Do you understand?
- Aye, sir. Sorry, sir.

11:17.070 --> 11:18.070
Don't be sorry.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.120
- Let's just get it fixed.
- Yes, sir.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.550
Thank you. Thank you.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.360
- Captain's on the bridge.
- Report, sir.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.840
R.O. system's down for now.
Let's initiate conservation.

11:38.410 --> 11:40.550
Salt water shaving only, no showers.

11:40.560 --> 11:43.030
Water strictly used for
cooking and drinking.

11:44.740 --> 11:46.340
It's gonna be 100 degrees today.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.109
I'd like to reduce manning
at all watch stations

11:48.110 --> 11:50.060
and suspend all non-essential activities.

11:50.070 --> 11:53.770
Good. Meanwhile, I've got
other fish for you to fry.

12:01.530 --> 12:02.680
Good. I didn't wake ya.

12:05.630 --> 12:06.630
A hot one, huh?

12:07.910 --> 12:09.610
Reminds me of August in Chicago.

12:10.890 --> 12:12.740
That's where I'm from. You know that?

12:15.270 --> 12:17.880
Yeah, I was a cop. Homicide.

12:18.450 --> 12:21.850
South side. I was good at it, too.

12:23.470 --> 12:24.590
You mind if I smoke?

12:24.820 --> 12:25.820
Please don't.

12:34.940 --> 12:36.390
You ever hear of keelhauling?

12:36.530 --> 12:38.019
Can't say that I have, no.

12:38.020 --> 12:39.020
Really?

12:40.060 --> 12:43.050
See, back in the mid
1800s when a sea captain

12:43.250 --> 12:45.720
encountered a particularly
problematic sailor,

12:47.030 --> 12:48.609
He'd have him bound with rope,

12:48.610 --> 12:50.260
thrown over the side of the ship,

12:50.660 --> 12:52.160
dragged underneath the hull.

12:53.810 --> 12:56.989
Poor bastard would bounce
and scrape along the keel,

12:56.990 --> 12:58.360
barnacles and such.

12:59.050 --> 13:01.050
But when he'd come up on the other side,

13:01.390 --> 13:03.380
if he wasn't drowned or decapitated...

13:05.520 --> 13:07.530
he tended to be a lot more cooperative.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.120
Keelhauling.

13:15.260 --> 13:17.319
Just off the top of my
head, I can think of about

13:17.320 --> 13:19.079
200 sailors on board this ship

13:19.080 --> 13:20.780
who'd like to try that out on you.

13:22.230 --> 13:24.630
Captain Chandler would
never allow such a thing.

13:25.270 --> 13:26.270
Hmm, maybe.

13:27.760 --> 13:28.760
Maybe not.

13:29.530 --> 13:33.159
Personally, I never found
torture that effective

13:33.160 --> 13:34.899
in my line of work. I told
you I was a cop, right?

13:34.900 --> 13:36.210
- You did, yes.
- Yeah.

13:37.470 --> 13:38.470
See, I always found that

13:38.471 --> 13:41.200
if you just laid out the facts for a guy,

13:41.960 --> 13:43.520
treated him with a little respect,

13:43.560 --> 13:46.740
maybe give him a chance to redeem himself,

13:46.840 --> 13:48.010
earn somethin' back...

13:50.290 --> 13:51.640
He'd make the right choice.

13:51.950 --> 13:53.710
You can't force me back into the lab.

13:53.720 --> 13:54.720
I won't do it.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.480
Well, suit yourself.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.070
But remember, we got a hard
and fast rule on this ship.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.240
Anything that doesn't
serve a purpose is gone.

14:07.790 --> 14:09.290
Ain't no fat on the bone here.

14:10.190 --> 14:11.690
Hope you can hold your breath.

14:12.130 --> 14:13.130
I want sunlight.

14:17.320 --> 14:18.980
And someone to play chess with.

14:20.830 --> 14:21.830
Someone good.

14:25.730 --> 14:27.529
Did you reset the electronic
governor controls?

14:27.530 --> 14:29.560
Cycled them three times.
They're completely wiped.

14:29.940 --> 14:31.530
Did you try to rig casualty power cables

14:31.540 --> 14:32.240
from main one?

14:32.241 --> 14:34.289
There's no way to do it. The
main cable riser's melted.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.810
Mr. Chung, you qualified E.E.O faster

14:37.820 --> 14:39.240
than anyone I've ever seen,

14:39.710 --> 14:41.329
and you could rebuild
most of this power plant

14:41.330 --> 14:42.430
with your eyes closed.

14:43.020 --> 14:44.420
You're going to handle this.

15:06.310 --> 15:07.579
I'm guessing the gene sequencing

15:07.580 --> 15:09.320
showed a high degree of variation.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.689
You're having trouble distinguishing

15:10.690 --> 15:13.009
what's causing the enhanced pathogenesis

15:13.010 --> 15:14.660
and what's just background noise.

15:15.640 --> 15:19.600
Right you are... as usual.

15:20.290 --> 15:21.810
Let's get to it, shall we?

15:27.820 --> 15:28.970
It's gonna take a week,

15:29.150 --> 15:30.509
maybe 10 days at all stop

15:30.510 --> 15:32.760
- to repair the engine damage, sir.
- A week?

15:32.920 --> 15:34.709
We can run one of the
four turbines on manual,

15:34.710 --> 15:37.079
but... the seawater system's fried,

15:37.080 --> 15:38.369
so we... we can't cool the engines.

15:38.370 --> 15:40.130
And how long can we run
without overheating?

15:40.370 --> 15:42.409
Maybe an hour, but then another five

15:42.410 --> 15:43.239
to let it cool down,

15:43.240 --> 15:44.560
But I'll have to wash down the engines

15:44.570 --> 15:45.970
before we can even try that.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.400
So what's the issue? Something
with the R.O. systems?

15:48.410 --> 15:49.749
The circuit breakers in the load centers...

15:49.750 --> 15:51.200
they're completely burnt out.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.070
We can't make fresh drinking water.

15:53.530 --> 15:54.950
And how long to fix that?

15:55.160 --> 15:57.859
Also a week, sir. And
that's the real problem.

15:57.860 --> 15:59.719
The entire time we were in Gitmo,

15:59.720 --> 16:01.820
we weren't filtering water from the harbor

16:02.050 --> 16:05.000
because we didn't know if it
was contaminated by the virus.

16:05.060 --> 16:06.160
So we're down to...

16:07.640 --> 16:09.840
what, 3,000 gallons of fresh water?

16:10.390 --> 16:11.470
Just about, sir.

16:15.250 --> 16:17.719
- Costa Rica will have to wait.
- Agreed.

16:17.720 --> 16:20.559
We'll have to dead-stick until
we get that one engine on line.

16:20.560 --> 16:23.709
We got an hour every six to
make as much distance as we can

16:23.710 --> 16:26.439
to find the safest place to
make port and get fresh water.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.050
I'm recommending we head
here... Serrana Bank.

16:29.600 --> 16:32.269
It's uninhabited, which means it
should be untouched by the virus,

16:32.270 --> 16:34.360
and it gets over a hundred
inches of rain per year.

16:34.690 --> 16:37.060
We can anchor there until the
engineers get us back on line.

16:37.110 --> 16:40.630
E.T.A.? Given our current
limitations with engine output?

16:41.520 --> 16:44.080
Taking into account projected
winds and current...

16:44.840 --> 16:46.559
six, six and a half days.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.060
There gotta be someplace else.

16:48.070 --> 16:50.220
The area has been pretty well-charted, sir.

16:50.310 --> 16:53.410
Maybe we can find an abandoned
ship with a fresh water supply.

16:53.630 --> 16:54.669
All right, send the U.A.V.

16:54.670 --> 16:56.909
Widest possible range in all directions.

16:56.910 --> 17:00.060
It finds any source of water, I
wanna know about it. - Aye, sir.

17:00.180 --> 17:01.709
Set course for that island.

17:01.710 --> 17:03.029
Let's get that engine back on line.

17:03.030 --> 17:04.079
Yes, captain.

17:07.890 --> 17:11.858
Six days. Even at our most severe rations,

17:11.859 --> 17:14.760
we're gonna have to travel the
last two without any water.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Day three...

17:16.010 --> 17:17.849
Day three, people start to die.

17:26.890 --> 17:29.030
Surface search radar off standby.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.420
Gain set to low.

17:31.290 --> 17:32.549
No sign of land, sir.

17:32.550 --> 17:34.900
U.A.V.'s got nothing either. Keep looking.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.390
Careful. Don't spill that.

17:49.010 --> 17:50.440
All that water in the ocean...

17:50.470 --> 17:52.440
it's almost impossible
to make it drinkable.

17:52.500 --> 17:53.719
Hence, the stills.

17:53.720 --> 17:57.010
Oh, yeah. I am dying over here.

17:58.730 --> 18:00.190
You heard of water into wine?

18:00.590 --> 18:01.880
This is beer into water.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.610
That is enough to make a grown man cry.

18:06.940 --> 18:08.220
Tell me about it.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.320
Sir, 10 seconds until engines up.

18:18.020 --> 18:20.850
Light off engine in 5... 4...

18:20.960 --> 18:23.660
3...2... 1.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.309
Starboard engine ahead full.

18:31.310 --> 18:33.039
Aye, Sir. Starboard engine ahead full.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.720
Starboard engine ahead full, aye.

18:45.370 --> 18:47.230
We've got one hour till engine shutdown.

18:47.310 --> 18:48.360
Let's make some time.

19:03.400 --> 19:04.920
Hang on, sweetheart.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.140
Sector 3 is negative.

19:10.300 --> 19:11.709
No vessels, no land.

19:11.710 --> 19:12.980
UAV to sector 4.

19:24.470 --> 19:25.470
Mr. Chung...

19:25.470 --> 19:26.140
I know, I know,

19:26.141 --> 19:28.330
she's too hot. We're pushing this.

19:30.760 --> 19:33.840
Engine shutdown in 5, 4,

19:33.880 --> 19:35.900
3, 2...

19:38.380 --> 19:40.340
Chung, how are we looking?
We got any wiggle room?

19:40.390 --> 19:41.589
The engine is piping hot, Sir.

19:41.590 --> 19:43.090
We cannot push it any further.

19:44.900 --> 19:46.439
E-stop one alpha G.T.M.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.149
Let's shut it down and let it cool off.

19:48.150 --> 19:49.670
E-stop one alpha G.T.M.

20:02.540 --> 20:05.410
It's dark. Why hasn't it gotten any cooler?

20:05.470 --> 20:07.080
It's hotter inside.

20:08.020 --> 20:10.690
Hell, I'll sleep outside
standing up if I had to.

20:20.470 --> 20:21.470
Finished.

20:27.830 --> 20:30.330
I suppose you'll want to
triple-check the results.

20:51.530 --> 20:53.420
When you look up at the night sky,

20:54.460 --> 20:56.389
just know that wherever I am,

20:56.390 --> 20:59.350
I'm looking at the same stars.

20:59.940 --> 21:03.460
And I'll be thinking about you and you.

21:04.820 --> 21:08.200
So no matter what, we'll
always be together.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.540
Okay?

21:25.350 --> 21:26.410
What's this?

21:26.620 --> 21:29.120
Well, you said you wanted
a rain check on the tea.

21:29.250 --> 21:32.350
Sorry, I'm not equipped with
finger sandwiches or scones.

21:32.950 --> 21:36.310
I'd have thought you
would've used your water

21:36.320 --> 21:37.920
on a colder drink.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.270
This can't be tea.

21:43.580 --> 21:46.400
It's camellia sinensis.
It's an organic green.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.300
I actually save it for special occasions.

21:49.370 --> 21:50.630
Such as?

21:52.320 --> 21:54.720
The breakthrough that I've
been working towards.

21:55.500 --> 21:56.510
It's happened.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.020
I have a vaccine prototype,
and it's time to test.

22:03.980 --> 22:05.840
I would've brought champagne, but...

22:08.050 --> 22:09.470
This will do just fine.

22:20.530 --> 22:23.780
60 seconds until we need to power
down the engine again, Captain.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.189
T.A.O., bridge. What's the
status on the U.A.V.?

22:28.190 --> 22:29.089
Sorry, Sir.

22:29.090 --> 22:32.309
No sign of land or other vessels
at sea in 360-degree search.

22:32.310 --> 22:33.169
10 seconds, Sir.

22:33.170 --> 22:35.219
Current destination is
best option for water.

22:35.220 --> 22:36.620
We got a problem in the lab.

22:38.070 --> 22:39.070
That's all we have?

22:39.080 --> 22:40.940
Four breakers... that was the last one.

22:41.010 --> 22:42.030
Oh, no.

22:42.260 --> 22:43.839
Tell me the virus is secure.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.140
Yes, everything is sealed. What's happened?

22:46.150 --> 22:47.749
Ma'am, the relay switch overheated

22:47.750 --> 22:50.300
and shorted out the breakers
on the last generator.

22:50.390 --> 22:52.030
Well, is it beyond repair?

22:52.150 --> 22:53.220
Afraid so.

22:53.460 --> 22:54.959
You understand that without power,

22:54.960 --> 22:57.299
the temperature inside my
cooling units are rising.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.479
If they go over 41 degrees Fahrenheit,

22:59.480 --> 23:01.400
we'll lose the primordial sample,

23:01.430 --> 23:04.259
the sample from the cruise ship,
and the experimental vaccine.

23:04.260 --> 23:06.369
What about the portable
generator in the R&A locker?

23:06.370 --> 23:08.089
That seized up during
maintenance in the Arctic.

23:08.090 --> 23:10.099
Every time we run the engines,
you get power to the lab.

23:10.100 --> 23:10.690
I made sure...

23:10.691 --> 23:13.500
Power for one hour for every
six is not sufficient.

23:14.010 --> 23:17.090
I need the virus at a
constant low temperature.

23:19.060 --> 23:20.210
We can throw it overboard.

23:20.220 --> 23:21.540
Throw what overboard?

23:21.650 --> 23:24.660
All your work, into the
water, to cool it down.

23:25.780 --> 23:29.229
We're in the Tropics. The
water must be 80 degrees.

23:29.230 --> 23:32.390
Not at the bottom. - Well, even
if the water is cold enough,

23:32.400 --> 23:34.679
the pressure will crush
the glass containers.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.619
Well, I'm sure we can
rig something for that.

23:36.620 --> 23:38.370
- Can't we, lieutenant?
- Yes, sir.

23:38.410 --> 23:39.749
Look, I appreciate that,

23:39.750 --> 23:41.149
but if you sink the samples,

23:41.150 --> 23:42.859
there's no way that you
can move the ship forward

23:42.860 --> 23:44.719
without raising that case
towards the surface.

23:44.720 --> 23:45.720
She's right.

23:45.830 --> 23:47.810
We'll be stuck in place until
we get the engines repaired,

23:47.820 --> 23:49.879
and we're already running
out of drinking water.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.619
If we can figure out a way
to spin the propellers,

23:51.620 --> 23:54.620
we can generate enough electricity
to cool the lab, correct?

23:54.790 --> 23:55.859
Yes, Sir, but how can we

23:55.860 --> 23:57.449
spin the propellers without the engine?

23:57.450 --> 23:58.650
Rig the case now.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.670
Get your samples ready
to put 'em in the ocean.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.279
Please be certain they're secure.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.410
It's good to go.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.260
Easy! Lieutenant.

24:15.500 --> 24:17.889
Due respect, Captain, we only
have a small window of time

24:17.890 --> 24:20.019
to make it to the island
on the water we have.

24:20.020 --> 24:23.330
The hours we spend doing this
we will not be able to make up.

24:23.410 --> 24:24.549
Gator checked the barometer.

24:24.550 --> 24:27.160
Said there's a low front
coming in from the east.

24:27.250 --> 24:29.550
We get the winds we need, we can do this.

24:29.610 --> 24:30.980
Relying on the winds?

24:31.200 --> 24:33.690
Our entire mission is in that case.

24:33.770 --> 24:35.239
I have to say this, Sir.

24:35.240 --> 24:38.060
If the winds don't blow our
way, we kill our crew.

24:43.090 --> 24:44.660
You're sure it's gonna hold?

24:44.780 --> 24:45.920
It's gonna hold.

24:48.710 --> 24:49.990
10 feet from the surface.

24:50.780 --> 24:51.920
Almost there.

24:53.220 --> 24:54.300
Okay, it's in.

25:01.830 --> 25:04.080
Shouldn't the temperature
be dropping faster?

25:04.340 --> 25:06.790
It takes a moment for the
thermostat to catch up.

25:07.250 --> 25:08.690
Come on, come on.

25:08.790 --> 25:10.200
Come on. Come on.

25:13.110 --> 25:14.320
300 feet.

25:14.560 --> 25:15.660
Come on.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.970
Come on, come on, come on.

25:28.269 --> 25:29.269
We've hit bottom.

25:29.270 --> 25:30.670
All right, tie off the line.

25:43.510 --> 25:44.600
42...

25:44.990 --> 25:45.990
41...

25:46.830 --> 25:48.420
Come on, come on.

25:48.500 --> 25:49.790
40. We did it.

25:51.430 --> 25:52.450
Thank God.

26:00.330 --> 26:01.400
Dear God.

26:05.390 --> 26:06.920
Well, you got your sunshine.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.740
Never seen a day as windless.

26:12.970 --> 26:15.080
I'm a gambling man myself.

26:15.430 --> 26:18.430
Captain's put all his chips in
the middle of the table here.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.740
Sure hope he's got an ace up his sleeve.

26:25.430 --> 26:27.119
Sir, the boatswain's mates

26:27.120 --> 26:29.120
have loaded pilot chutes into launchers.

26:29.200 --> 26:29.929
Strong enough breeze,

26:29.930 --> 26:32.980
and we'll shoot them high enough
to engage the larger chutes.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.159
That should give us just enough speed

26:34.160 --> 26:36.010
to turn the prop and get electricity.

26:36.260 --> 26:39.110
- Won't help us make water, but...
- So where's the wind?

26:49.390 --> 26:50.940
Gator said the wind was coming.

26:52.480 --> 26:53.820
It's gotta come, right?

26:58.970 --> 27:01.990
I'm guessing the navy told
you about my car accident.

27:03.640 --> 27:06.610
Yeah. Yeah. They did.

27:07.470 --> 27:08.710
Well, there's something

27:09.190 --> 27:10.680
they don't even know about.

27:12.680 --> 27:13.950
It was my fault.

27:15.550 --> 27:17.449
Tried to pass a car on a curve.

27:17.450 --> 27:19.210
Didn't see the oncoming truck.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.790
I killed my wife and my girls.

27:25.730 --> 27:28.460
I was in the I.C.U. For 82 days.

27:28.770 --> 27:32.190
Seven times I coded, seven
times they brought me back.

27:33.130 --> 27:35.269
In between, I had plenty of
time to think and to wonder,

27:35.270 --> 27:37.240
Why did God leave me here?

27:39.200 --> 27:40.650
Why did he spare me?

27:41.520 --> 27:45.240
There must be a purpose, some reason.

27:46.970 --> 27:48.640
Well, that's what I told myself.

27:50.020 --> 27:51.249
That's how I woke up every day

27:51.250 --> 27:52.639
and put one foot in front of the other.

27:52.640 --> 27:55.520
It was faith that got me through.

27:56.759 --> 27:57.759
But these past weeks,

27:57.760 --> 28:00.370
that faith has been
replaced with certainty.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.319
I am here for a reason, as are you,

28:04.320 --> 28:06.260
as is everyone aboard this ship.

28:07.390 --> 28:09.050
You are here to lead us,

28:09.240 --> 28:12.230
And we are here to follow,
to execute your vision.

28:13.070 --> 28:14.570
I don't have a vision.

28:16.680 --> 28:17.710
You do.

28:18.520 --> 28:21.140
When you stuck your hand
in that engine fuse,

28:21.210 --> 28:22.839
and you turned us away from home,

28:22.840 --> 28:26.170
when you got us out of Gitmo,

28:27.450 --> 28:30.440
there's a... a voice inside you.

28:30.630 --> 28:32.589
Maybe it's your highest self,
maybe it's the voice of God.

28:32.590 --> 28:37.100
I don't know, but...
It's a voice of... hope.

28:38.320 --> 28:39.980
You've listened to it so far.

28:39.990 --> 28:42.130
All you have to do is keep listening.

28:43.030 --> 28:45.670
Our journey does not end here.

28:59.380 --> 29:03.990
"And moses answered the
people, 'do not be afraid.

29:04.760 --> 29:07.489
"'Stand firm, and you
will see the deliverance

29:07.490 --> 29:09.290
"'the lord will bring you today.

29:10.470 --> 29:12.280
"'The lord will fight for you.

29:12.790 --> 29:14.420
You need only be still.'"

29:15.170 --> 29:17.630
Trust that there's
something else out there,

29:18.280 --> 29:22.490
something bigger than
ourselves, something better,

29:24.810 --> 29:27.700
'cause right now we feel very, very small.

29:28.910 --> 29:30.649
We're not too proud to say we need help,

29:30.650 --> 29:32.220
and we need it right now.

29:33.860 --> 29:35.540
So we bow our heads together,

29:36.890 --> 29:38.740
and we lift this prayer to you

29:40.030 --> 29:41.390
and ask that you

29:42.020 --> 29:46.680
protect us so that we may do
good in the world that you made.

29:48.050 --> 29:49.170
Amen.

29:49.470 --> 29:50.490
Amen.

30:00.610 --> 30:03.710
Boats! Prepare to launch the chutes!

30:03.730 --> 30:05.650
Port side, on my mark!

30:07.670 --> 30:12.150
3...2... 1. Fire!

30:16.010 --> 30:19.300
Second gun! Fire!

30:20.170 --> 30:21.350
Third gun!

30:21.960 --> 30:23.120
Fire!

30:36.789 --> 30:37.789
Holy shit.

30:37.790 --> 30:38.930
Hell, yeah.

30:55.840 --> 30:59.790
Set modified condition three.
Bring up that case!

31:00.200 --> 31:01.200
Aye, sir.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.390
Okay. Gently does it.

31:06.390 --> 31:07.420
Easy.

31:07.850 --> 31:09.360
Central, this is M.P.A..

31:09.910 --> 31:11.909
Close load circuits on the
impeller alternators.

31:11.910 --> 31:13.150
Let's do this thing.

31:25.540 --> 31:27.270
Bravo zulu, Mr. Chung.

31:35.880 --> 31:38.560
This is U.S.S. Nathan James,

31:39.060 --> 31:41.360
Hailing any vessel in our vicinity.

31:42.810 --> 31:44.680
We are operating without radar.

31:45.540 --> 31:49.259
We believe we are approximately
a hundred miles east,

31:49.260 --> 31:51.510
northeast of Serrana Bank.

31:51.900 --> 31:54.050
We've been over two days without water.

31:55.800 --> 31:57.890
Hailing any vessel...

31:59.560 --> 32:02.010
in the vicinity of Serrana Bank.

32:03.710 --> 32:06.110
We are in distress and require assistance.

32:07.250 --> 32:08.780
Sail still holding, sir.

32:09.350 --> 32:12.060
Winds from the north,
northeast at 14 knots.

32:12.070 --> 32:14.049
Making 4 knots over water, sir.

32:14.050 --> 32:15.880
How long till engines up?

32:18.110 --> 32:19.180
Four hours.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.100
Go for X.O.

32:29.410 --> 32:31.050
X.O., I've got 10 more down.

32:31.290 --> 32:34.009
I think it's time to stand on all
non-essential watch stations.

32:34.010 --> 32:36.150
Copy that. Proceed.

32:47.730 --> 32:48.830
I'm sorry.

32:51.200 --> 32:53.200
I thought we'd make up more time.

33:03.650 --> 33:05.949
All right, my friends, you're
gonna be just fine, okay?

33:05.950 --> 33:08.470
You're all right. Head up.

33:09.550 --> 33:13.200
Just sip. There you go. Keep still.

33:17.220 --> 33:18.280
Keep still.

33:22.710 --> 33:24.409
Okay, uh, take small sips. Careful.

33:24.410 --> 33:25.410
That's good.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.360
Can I join you all?

33:33.850 --> 33:34.890
Are you kiddin' me?

33:35.110 --> 33:37.130
Bring it here, Right beside ol' Tex.

33:51.180 --> 33:53.550
How you feeling? Are you all right?

34:02.540 --> 34:04.140
We're not gonna make it, are we?

34:37.880 --> 34:38.920
Captain?

34:39.310 --> 34:43.960
Incoming low slow flying
objects 20 degrees relative.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.800
Identify as seagulls.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.610
Birds mean land.

34:50.530 --> 34:54.400
Radar's still down, sir, but...
that sounds pretty good to me.

35:00.030 --> 35:01.120
Water.

35:03.020 --> 35:04.080
We made it.

35:05.540 --> 35:06.610
We made it, sir.

35:19.880 --> 35:23.100
I believe there are a few of
you who have earned some R&R.

35:23.560 --> 35:24.560
See?

35:24.820 --> 35:25.840
Piece of cake.

35:26.170 --> 35:27.550
Never doubted it, sir.

35:44.760 --> 35:46.169
Guess we got a beach after all.

35:46.170 --> 35:47.430
We sure did.

35:53.010 --> 35:54.010
Fire it up.

35:55.770 --> 35:57.500
I don't see a cup of water in your hand.

35:57.670 --> 35:59.820
- Take this one, too.
- Take this one, too.

35:59.980 --> 36:00.980
Okay.

36:02.320 --> 36:03.320
All right.

36:12.800 --> 36:13.890
Mr. Chung!

36:17.360 --> 36:19.090
Figured you could use this.

36:19.790 --> 36:21.080
Fresh from the island.

36:21.510 --> 36:22.860
Thank you, sir.

36:24.300 --> 36:26.380
I, uh, got the auxiliary power up.

36:26.440 --> 36:28.179
At least we can keep the
doctor's work on ice

36:28.180 --> 36:29.430
while I make the repairs.

36:30.270 --> 36:31.710
You did well, Lieutenant.

36:33.130 --> 36:34.259
Ah, I don't know, sir.

36:34.260 --> 36:37.030
I keep thinking maybe I could
have prevented that fire

36:37.420 --> 36:38.970
if I'd checked the filters better.

36:39.110 --> 36:43.210
Maybe, but it was your idea and ingenuity

36:43.220 --> 36:44.620
that saved the virus.

36:45.749 --> 36:46.749
Let's just say I'm looking forward

36:46.750 --> 36:49.100
to the chief engineer
getting back on her feet.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.140
Well, you're finding your way.

36:53.110 --> 36:54.160
We all are.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.280
Yes, sir.

36:56.710 --> 36:58.010
Thank you, sir.

37:05.610 --> 37:06.760
Let's see what you got.

37:07.380 --> 37:08.449
Are you watching?

37:08.450 --> 37:09.939
I'm watching it, all right. I'm watching.

37:09.940 --> 37:12.579
The hands. - Hands. All hands.
I'm all hands.

37:12.580 --> 37:13.720
I'm all hands!

37:14.510 --> 37:17.629
Hey there, Mary Poppins.
You wanna get in on this?

37:17.630 --> 37:19.109
Um, maybe another time.

37:19.110 --> 37:21.049
- I'm an excellent teacher.
- I have no doubt.

37:21.050 --> 37:22.599
So you gotta move those hips for the hula.

37:22.600 --> 37:23.769
I bet you could.

37:23.770 --> 37:25.519
- Where you going?
- Over this way.

37:25.520 --> 37:26.600
Need an escort?

37:26.730 --> 37:28.029
Maybe I'll take a rain check on that.

37:28.030 --> 37:29.169
All right. All right.

37:29.170 --> 37:31.070
Dude, rain check!

37:31.180 --> 37:33.850
Lock and load, ladies. It's hula time.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.580
Little bit of coconut milk,

37:51.060 --> 37:53.240
and a little bit of somethin'-somethin'.

37:53.280 --> 37:55.650
- Somethin'-somethin'.
- Well, it's water.

37:56.650 --> 37:58.550
But it's better than rum today, right?

37:59.060 --> 38:00.190
Yep. Cheers.

38:00.430 --> 38:01.430
Cheers.

38:19.920 --> 38:23.510
*I was born by the river*

38:24.120 --> 38:27.160
*ln a little tent*

38:27.300 --> 38:30.829
*Oh, and just like that river*

38:30.830 --> 38:35.730
*I've been running ever since*

38:35.820 --> 38:38.990
*lt's been a long*

38:39.340 --> 38:42.370
*A long time coming*

38:42.500 --> 38:45.260
*But I know*

38:45.490 --> 38:48.450
*A change gon' come*

38:48.760 --> 38:51.770
*Oh, yes, it will*

39:00.480 --> 39:03.680
Let me guess. I'm not going to the island.

39:03.690 --> 39:04.840
Let me guess.

39:05.080 --> 39:07.630
You're the asshole I'm
supposed to play chess with.

39:21.069 --> 39:22.069
You have a name?

39:22.070 --> 39:23.480
People call me "Bacon."

39:25.149 --> 39:26.149
Why is that?

39:26.150 --> 39:27.520
You got a nose, don't you?

39:28.630 --> 39:29.870
I work in the galley.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.369
So that's what that is.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.440
Let's just play.

39:34.210 --> 39:37.009
It's been six months since
I've touched dry land,

39:37.010 --> 39:40.770
and I ain't interested in becoming friends.
Okay.

39:41.160 --> 39:44.820
*lt's been a long*

39:44.980 --> 39:47.850
*A long time coming*

39:47.870 --> 39:50.570
*But I know*

39:50.630 --> 39:52.950
*Change gon' come*

39:53.500 --> 39:56.460
*Oh, yes, it will*

39:59.730 --> 40:03.750
*Then I go to my brother*

40:05.870 --> 40:08.800
*And I say, brother*

40:08.940 --> 40:12.459
*Help me, please*

40:12.460 --> 40:14.400
Radio transmission out there, anyone?

40:15.180 --> 40:17.460
*But he winds up*

40:18.030 --> 40:21.330
*Knocking me*

40:22.520 --> 40:28.040
*Right back on my knees*

40:33.280 --> 40:35.010
Not in the mood for celebrating?

40:35.150 --> 40:37.020
Just tying up some loose ends.

40:48.460 --> 40:49.470
Thank you.

40:49.670 --> 40:50.670
For what?

40:51.250 --> 40:52.610
For believing in me.

40:53.170 --> 40:54.880
I didn't have much choice.

40:55.560 --> 40:57.710
I think you've had quite a few choices.

41:00.850 --> 41:02.479
From the very beginning,

41:02.480 --> 41:05.630
you could have docked at Norfolk
and gone back for your family.

41:08.630 --> 41:09.740
We'll get there.

41:21.380 --> 41:25.040
*lt's been a long*

41:25.650 --> 41:28.730
*Such a long time coming*

41:29.080 --> 41:31.470
*But I know*

41:31.900 --> 41:34.120
*Change gon' come*

41:35.060 --> 41:38.440
*Oh, yes, it will*
