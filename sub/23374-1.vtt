01:30.216 --> 01:32.635
You were gone so long.
I was worried.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.471
I had to go all the way
to that goddamn gourmet deli.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.597
But you got them?

01:36.722 --> 01:38.474
- A dozen.
- Good. Good.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.434
Nah, they're too damn small.

01:40.559 --> 01:44.146
Not like the ones we got from Gottlieb,
may he rest in peace.

01:44.271 --> 01:47.024
Maybe we should order
from that French butcher again.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.150
No way!

01:48.275 --> 01:51.821
Always asking questions,
making jokes...

01:51.946 --> 01:53.864
Oh...!

01:53.989 --> 01:56.867
These are beautiful.

01:56.992 --> 01:59.537
Beautiful.

01:59.662 --> 02:01.956
Oh, he'll love them.

02:02.081 --> 02:05.459
Puny little things,
way overpriced.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.461
God, I miss Gottlieb.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.255
Are you coming now?

02:09.380 --> 02:12.133
- I'm going to feed him.
- In a minute.

02:12.258 --> 02:16.470
He's going to be so excited.

02:17.304 --> 02:20.516
Aylmer, din-din.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.226
Woo-hoo!

02:25.396 --> 02:27.523
(Screams)

02:29.275 --> 02:31.902
(Continues screaming)

02:33.445 --> 02:34.446
(Husband) What? What?

02:34.572 --> 02:36.657
- He's gone.
- No!

02:36.782 --> 02:39.160
- Oh, my God.
- He's gone!

02:39.285 --> 02:42.580
(Sobs) He's gone.

02:45.374 --> 02:47.459
(Telephone rings)

03:05.352 --> 03:08.314
- (Woman) 'Brian? Hello, Brian.'
- (Brian moans)

03:08.439 --> 03:10.524
- 'Are you asleep?'
- (Brian continues moaning)

03:10.649 --> 03:12.943
'Brian, you're supposed to be
getting ready. We have to leave soon.'

03:13.068 --> 03:14.612
(Continues moaning)

03:14.737 --> 03:17.114
'Brian? Brian?

03:17.239 --> 03:18.574
'Brian?'

03:20.659 --> 03:22.453
Aylmer?

03:24.079 --> 03:25.623
Where are you?

03:46.268 --> 03:48.562
Oh...! Oh...!

03:48.687 --> 03:50.522
(Sobs)

04:17.216 --> 04:19.093
(Sobs)

04:42.700 --> 04:44.827
(Sobbing, screaming)

04:51.917 --> 04:53.585
(Doorbell buzzes)

04:57.631 --> 05:00.926
- He's still asleep?
- Yep. Afraid so.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.059
(Woman) Brian?

05:10.269 --> 05:12.062
Brian?

05:14.106 --> 05:15.149
Brian?

05:16.608 --> 05:19.445
Come on, Brian.
We have to leave here in a few minutes.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.452
You look awful.

05:26.577 --> 05:28.329
I feel awful.

05:28.454 --> 05:31.248
- Are you sick?
- I wasn't before.

05:31.373 --> 05:32.791
Just laid down for a quick nap,

05:32.916 --> 05:36.128
and all of a sudden my head is spinning
and I'm too dizzy to move.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.547
I dunno, maybe there's something
going around.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.716
(Knocking)

05:42.551 --> 05:43.552
- Yes?
- Hi.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.387
We're the Ackermans,
the couple down the hall.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.181
I'm Martha.
This is Morris.

05:47.306 --> 05:49.308
- Could we see your bathtub a minute?
- My bathtub?

05:49.433 --> 05:51.101
- Yes, please. You see...
- Hey!

05:56.648 --> 05:57.649
Uh!

05:57.775 --> 06:00.069
What's wrong? What's he doing?
What the hell is going on?

06:00.194 --> 06:02.363
Sorry. Our mistake.
Have a nice day.

06:02.488 --> 06:04.865
"Have a nice day"?

06:06.075 --> 06:08.369
Well, you're certainly in no shape
to go out tonight.

06:08.494 --> 06:10.704
"Out"?
I can't even stand.

06:11.246 --> 06:12.790
Poor baby.

06:12.915 --> 06:15.501
Wait a minute.
There's no reason you shouldn't go.

06:15.626 --> 06:18.003
- I don't want to go without you.
- Go with Mike.

06:18.128 --> 06:20.130
- No. No...
- Why not?

06:20.255 --> 06:22.007
You've already got the tickets.
Hey, Mike! Come here!

06:22.132 --> 06:24.885
- He'd love to go. Ask him.
- Hey, what's up?

06:25.010 --> 06:27.638
Do your brother a favor
and take her out tonight.

06:27.763 --> 06:29.848
Want to go to the Syd concert
with me tonight?

06:30.641 --> 06:33.560
- Brian can't go.
- Sure. I'd love to.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.772
- You don't mind?
- Of course not.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.024
OK, great.
Thanks.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.526
You sure you'll be OK?

06:41.318 --> 06:44.071
I just need some sleep.
I'm going to be fine.

06:51.495 --> 06:54.873
- I hope he's OK. He never gets sick.
- You know Brian.

06:54.998 --> 06:58.001
- He'll be a new man in the morning.
- I sure hope so.

07:08.846 --> 07:11.473
(Moaning)

08:07.988 --> 08:09.823
(Gasps)

08:21.418 --> 08:22.961
Shit!

08:23.462 --> 08:24.546
Shit!

08:31.637 --> 08:33.304
Shit!

08:35.349 --> 08:36.350
(Groans)

08:39.436 --> 08:41.522
What the hell's happening to me?

08:43.649 --> 08:45.192
(Laughs)

08:58.247 --> 08:59.957
(Groans)

09:53.093 --> 09:55.637
(Breathes heavily)

12:50.020 --> 12:52.063
(Draws sharp breath)

13:05.619 --> 13:07.662
OK, OK.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.081
I know there's someone else here.

13:10.749 --> 13:13.251
I don't know who you are
and I don't know what you are,

13:13.376 --> 13:15.295
but I know you're in here.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.423
So you may as well come on out.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.968
Come on out and let me see you.

13:23.428 --> 13:26.014
- (Gurgling)
- (Gasps)

13:45.575 --> 13:47.285
Hi.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.628
This is the start
of your new life, Brian.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.256
A life without worry
or pain or loneliness.

13:59.381 --> 14:03.677
A life filled instead with colors
and music and euphoria.

14:03.802 --> 14:06.680
- A life of light and pleasure.
- But who are you?

14:07.806 --> 14:11.142
- What are you?
- I am you, Brian.

14:11.268 --> 14:13.937
I'm all you'll ever need.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.606
- I don't understand.
- You will, Brian.

14:16.731 --> 14:19.651
From now on, your life
will take on a whole new light.

14:19.776 --> 14:23.113
And all you have to do
is look into the light and listen.

14:23.238 --> 14:24.948
Listen to the light, Brian.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.950
- Just listen to the light.
- Yes.

14:27.075 --> 14:29.494
Yes, I'd like to again, but...

14:30.245 --> 14:31.830
I don't see it now.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.832
Then I'll make you a deal.

14:33.957 --> 14:37.335
I'll show you the light
if you'll take me for a walk.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.505
"A walk"? Where?

14:40.630 --> 14:42.299
Anywhere you like.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.092
I'm hungry.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.512
Wait, wait... I'm confused.
I'm not following any of this.

14:47.637 --> 14:48.972
Then don't worry about it.

14:49.097 --> 14:52.350
You don't need to worry
about anything ever again.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.895
I'll do all your thinking for you.

14:55.020 --> 14:58.106
Just put me on the back of your neck
and everything will be fine.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.441
My neck?

14:59.983 --> 15:02.986
Oh, you mean the hole. I...
Wait... I don't know.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.947
Trust me, Brian.
Trust me.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.210
(Gurgling)

15:28.553 --> 15:30.347
(Draws breath)

15:36.853 --> 15:39.230
(Gurgling)

15:52.577 --> 15:54.955
(Groans)

16:12.931 --> 16:15.392
(Breathes heavily)

16:18.353 --> 16:20.230
(Slurping)

16:42.919 --> 16:44.838
(Shudders)

16:46.589 --> 16:49.342
(Breathes heavily)

16:53.471 --> 16:56.433
(Moans)

17:04.190 --> 17:05.775
(Moans)

17:07.277 --> 17:09.279
(Lock clicks)

17:10.864 --> 17:12.949
I just want to check on him.
Make sure he's OK.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.743
- OK.
- Shh!

17:15.868 --> 17:18.288
- (Mockingly) Shh!
- (Chuckles)

17:21.540 --> 17:23.542
Brian... (Chuckles)

17:27.630 --> 17:29.883
(Laughing)

17:36.097 --> 17:37.932
Guess I shouldn't have worried.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.352
Maybe he just went out
for something to eat.

17:41.478 --> 17:43.063
Yeah. Right.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.445
Um...

17:51.571 --> 17:53.156
Can I take you home now?

17:53.281 --> 17:55.450
Sure. Why not?

18:08.505 --> 18:10.215
Oh, wow!

18:10.340 --> 18:12.717
Oh, my God, wow!

18:43.790 --> 18:45.792
(Hissing)

18:50.839 --> 18:53.133
(Laughing)

18:53.716 --> 18:57.762
Whoo!
This is fucking great!

18:58.763 --> 19:01.015
(Brian) Whoo!

19:01.141 --> 19:04.227
Whoo! Whoo!

19:04.352 --> 19:06.771
Whoo!

19:06.896 --> 19:08.815
Whoo!

19:08.940 --> 19:11.484
Yeah! (Laughs)

19:11.609 --> 19:14.320
Whoo! Whoo!

19:14.445 --> 19:16.531
This is absolutely fucking great.

19:16.656 --> 19:20.493
(Laughs)

19:20.618 --> 19:23.496
(â™ª Radio jingle plays)

19:29.544 --> 19:32.338
(Radio) 'Listen, Charlie, I want you
and One-Shot to come on home,

19:32.463 --> 19:34.132
'or I'll fire both of you.'

19:34.257 --> 19:37.552
(Charlie) 'I'm not coming home,
and neither is One-Shot. Goodbye.'

19:41.306 --> 19:43.057
(Laughs)

19:52.483 --> 19:54.861
Whoo...!

19:55.945 --> 19:57.572
Whoo-hoo!

19:59.949 --> 20:01.492
Whoo!

20:06.122 --> 20:07.540
Whoo!

20:07.665 --> 20:09.000
Whoo!

20:09.125 --> 20:10.752
Whoo!

20:53.670 --> 20:55.296
Huh...

21:10.979 --> 21:13.481
(Whirring)

21:20.780 --> 21:22.031
Freeze, asshole.

21:24.409 --> 21:27.578
- All these colors.
- Shut the fuck up, asshole.

21:27.704 --> 21:29.747
Lie on your stomach
and don't make a fucking sound.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.128
What the fuck is that?

21:35.253 --> 21:36.254
Roll over.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.426
What the hell is that?

21:43.720 --> 21:45.221
(Screams)

21:51.602 --> 21:53.521
(Groaning)

22:04.699 --> 22:06.576
(Nightwatchman screaming)

22:30.183 --> 22:31.893
Wow!

22:33.227 --> 22:35.188
(Groaning)

22:38.524 --> 22:40.151
(Groaning stops)

22:54.207 --> 22:56.918
(Munching)

23:08.471 --> 23:10.473
Hey, wha...
what's going on?

23:10.598 --> 23:12.892
What are you doing?
Is he OK?

23:13.017 --> 23:15.436
Not bad.
A bit underdone.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.563
Let's go.
We better get out of here.

23:27.323 --> 23:30.034
Hey, could you juice me again?
The colors are starting to fade.

23:30.159 --> 23:32.787
- You've had enough tonight.
- Oh, come on. Just a little.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.206
Oh, all right.
Just a little.

23:43.965 --> 23:45.800
(Gurgling)

23:51.597 --> 23:53.433
Uh...

24:09.449 --> 24:12.076
(Breathes heavily)

24:19.584 --> 24:21.752
(Slurping)

24:28.509 --> 24:30.303
(Gurgling)

25:05.171 --> 25:07.632
(Doorbell buzzes)

25:09.675 --> 25:10.843
He's in the bathtub.

25:10.968 --> 25:13.513
He's been in the bathtub
for the last three hours.

25:13.638 --> 25:16.140
- Jesus!
- He's like a completely different person.

25:16.265 --> 25:19.352
I don't even know him anymore.
What is going on?

25:19.477 --> 25:21.896
I don't know. I've tried to call him,
but he's never home.

25:22.021 --> 25:25.107
Oh, he's here. He just doesn't answer
the phone anymore.

25:25.233 --> 25:28.903
Well, he finally answered it last night,
but all he did was giggle.

25:29.028 --> 25:32.073
You know, I don't even think
he goes to his job anymore.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.033
I don't even think
he leaves the apartment.

25:34.158 --> 25:36.994
If he's not in his room,
he's in the bathtub.

25:39.330 --> 25:41.123
Let me show you something.

25:46.796 --> 25:47.922
Look at this.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.757
That's more than he's got
on the front door.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.926
Yeah, but he only locks these
when he's in here.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.929
- Why? What's he hiding?
- I don't know.

25:55.054 --> 25:58.015
The only thing new
are those pails down there.

25:59.475 --> 26:02.019
He changes the water
four times a day.

26:02.812 --> 26:04.981
I'll show you something else.

26:07.650 --> 26:10.611
Look at this.
He's got the bathroom all bolted up, too.

26:10.736 --> 26:13.155
I tell you, he's become
a real stickler for privacy.

26:13.281 --> 26:14.991
Have you asked him about any of this?

26:15.491 --> 26:16.826
Yeah.

26:16.951 --> 26:18.536
What'd he say?

26:18.661 --> 26:20.997
He says he's been feeling
a little bit light-headed.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.207
"Light-headed"!

26:24.292 --> 26:27.295
Brian, are you clean yet?

26:27.420 --> 26:29.547
- Do you hear me?
- Huh?

26:30.047 --> 26:32.675
It's Barbara.
We have a date tonight, remember?

26:32.800 --> 26:34.760
Oh, yeah, sure.
I'll be right out.

26:34.885 --> 26:36.721
(Screams) Argh! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

26:36.846 --> 26:38.973
Whoo! Whoo!

26:39.348 --> 26:41.392
Whoo!

26:41.517 --> 26:42.977
Whoo!

26:43.102 --> 26:45.438
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!

26:46.147 --> 26:50.067
Things are getting
really weird around here.

26:50.192 --> 26:51.235
(Brian) Whoo!

26:52.695 --> 26:54.697
(Car horn blares)

26:56.616 --> 26:59.744
I'm going through some
pretty intense changes,

26:59.869 --> 27:01.829
and I need to be by myself for a while.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.624
- Why? What's happened?
- I see things differently now.

27:04.749 --> 27:06.584
- You mean us?
- Oh, everything.

27:06.709 --> 27:08.210
It just doesn't last very long.

27:08.336 --> 27:11.589
See, right now, for instance,
everything looks normal.

27:11.714 --> 27:13.466
See? No trails.

27:13.591 --> 27:14.967
- "No trails"?
- None.

27:15.092 --> 27:18.679
But sometimes...
sometimes I can see completely.

27:18.804 --> 27:21.599
Sometimes everything glows
with a different kind of light.

27:21.724 --> 27:25.561
I can touch an object
and listen to the sound of its color.

27:25.686 --> 27:29.231
I can hear voices and music
in the flicker of a match.

27:29.357 --> 27:30.566
I can look into a mirror

27:30.691 --> 27:33.361
and see a thousand different faces
staring back at me.

27:33.486 --> 27:36.530
I can turn night into day
or watch the darkness shine,

27:36.656 --> 27:38.366
and I don't even have to open my eyes.

27:38.491 --> 27:40.284
You're on drugs, right?

27:40.409 --> 27:42.036
(Laughs)

27:42.912 --> 27:44.580
Nothing that simple.

27:44.705 --> 27:45.706
Then what?

27:45.831 --> 27:47.833
I'm trying to understand you, Brian.

27:47.958 --> 27:50.670
But I feel like I'm talking to a stranger.

27:50.795 --> 27:53.714
Two months ago,
you wanted us to live together.

27:53.839 --> 27:57.551
Now you're telling me you haven't called
because of lights and colors,

27:57.677 --> 27:59.387
and I just don't understand.

27:59.512 --> 28:03.641
OK, OK, I'll try to explain it,
but I doubt you're going to believe me.

28:03.766 --> 28:05.851
Remember the night you and Mike
went to the concert?

28:05.976 --> 28:08.187
Well, when I woke up I...
Ow!

28:09.480 --> 28:10.981
Uh...

28:11.107 --> 28:13.943
Um, I don't think
I should explain it right now.

28:14.068 --> 28:16.195
- Why not?
- (Whispers) It won't let me.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.823
- What won't let you?
- I can't tell you that.

28:18.948 --> 28:21.867
It's someone else, isn't it?
You're seeing someone else.

28:21.992 --> 28:25.663
- Sort of. Ow!
- "Sort of"! What do you mean by "sort of"?

28:25.788 --> 28:28.332
Look, I got an itch.
I can't talk about it right now.

28:28.457 --> 28:30.751
It's not fair
to keep me guessing like this.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.670
If you're seeing someone else,

28:32.795 --> 28:36.632
if you want to end it between us,
can't you just tell me?

28:37.967 --> 28:41.387
(Aylmer moaning)

28:47.935 --> 28:50.354
Uh, uh, I just need some time.

28:50.479 --> 28:52.606
And what am I supposed to do
in the meantime?

28:52.732 --> 28:55.526
Sit at home and wait
for things to get back to normal?

28:55.651 --> 28:57.653
Or should I go out
and find someone else too?

28:57.778 --> 29:00.406
(Aylmer moaning)

29:05.161 --> 29:06.495
I'm not hungry.

29:06.620 --> 29:09.165
- Ten minutes ago you were starving.
- Yeah, but...

29:09.957 --> 29:12.418
(Aylmer moaning)

29:15.129 --> 29:17.506
- What are you doing?
- I... I don't feel so good.

29:17.631 --> 29:19.383
- Calm down, Brian.
- I... I gotta go.

29:19.508 --> 29:21.218
"Go"?
You can't just...

29:21.343 --> 29:22.887
Brian! Wait!

29:26.056 --> 29:27.808
Great.

30:41.799 --> 30:44.635
I need it. I need it now.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.720
(Coughs) I need it.

30:46.846 --> 30:49.515
(Coughs)
Now. Now, come on.

30:52.768 --> 30:54.728
(Gurgling)

30:56.856 --> 30:58.899
(Burps)

31:05.072 --> 31:07.116
Uh...

31:07.241 --> 31:09.410
(Breathes heavily)

31:24.425 --> 31:26.677
(Breathes heavily)

31:34.310 --> 31:36.770
(â™ª THE SWIMMING POOL Q'S:
"Corruption")

31:43.319 --> 31:44.904
Phew!

31:50.659 --> 31:54.163
â™ª I'm just another dead volcano

31:54.288 --> 31:57.833
â™ª Waiting on my eruption

31:58.751 --> 32:04.298
â™ª You're just another witness
to corruption

32:06.926 --> 32:10.638
â™ª You haven't seen me mean just yet

32:10.763 --> 32:14.767
â™ª You haven't seen me mean

32:14.892 --> 32:21.231
â™ª I can turn your family town
into one less mouth to feed

32:22.691 --> 32:25.986
â™ª I can take off everything that you own

32:26.111 --> 32:30.741
â™ª And turn it into something
that I thought that you'd need

32:30.866 --> 32:33.661
â™ª Take your precious doctor

32:33.786 --> 32:37.122
â™ª And your favorite first-born son

32:39.249 --> 32:46.715
â™ª I turn them into something
that will make you turn and run

32:47.424 --> 32:51.345
â™ª You haven't seen me mean just yet

32:51.470 --> 32:54.390
â™ª You haven't seen me mean

32:54.515 --> 32:56.684
â™ª Corruption

33:03.273 --> 33:06.193
â™ª You might know me
by my very first name

33:06.318 --> 33:11.240
â™ª But I'd like you
to call me by my last, or I'll... â™ª

33:11.365 --> 33:13.534
Hey! Hey!

33:13.659 --> 33:15.452
I love your suit

33:15.577 --> 33:17.830
- Wow, you're beautiful!
- Huh?

33:17.955 --> 33:21.834
- Beautiful. (Cackles)
- You're fucked up, aren't you?

33:21.959 --> 33:24.586
Wanna dance?

33:31.260 --> 33:33.512
(Brian cackles)

33:38.225 --> 33:40.936
(Vocalises)

33:47.067 --> 33:48.777
Huh!

33:48.902 --> 33:51.196
(Vocalises)

34:03.584 --> 34:07.129
â™ª You find your best friend
floating in a vat

34:07.254 --> 34:10.716
â™ª Down at the sewage plant

34:12.301 --> 34:17.889
â™ª It never made the papers,
some things just can't... â™ª

34:18.931 --> 34:22.895
(â™ª Song continues)

34:36.033 --> 34:38.159
Other people gotta use it.

34:38.284 --> 34:40.286
Let's go!

34:48.378 --> 34:51.047
Come on. Let's go.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.356
(Girl) Come on.

35:07.481 --> 35:08.774
Come on.

35:08.899 --> 35:10.400
Come on, I gotcha.

35:10.526 --> 35:12.820
- (Brian) Uh-huh.
- (Girl) Attaboy!

35:12.945 --> 35:14.696
(Chuckles)

35:19.243 --> 35:21.495
(Moaning)

35:28.127 --> 35:29.503
(Chuckles)

35:33.298 --> 35:35.843
(Moaning)

35:47.688 --> 35:49.898
(Chuckles)

36:08.500 --> 36:11.712
Feels like you've got
a real monster in there.

36:21.805 --> 36:24.057
Hey. Hey.

36:24.183 --> 36:25.934
Don't pass out on me now.

36:26.059 --> 36:27.394
Here.

36:57.591 --> 36:58.800
- (Gasps)
- (Roars)

37:00.677 --> 37:02.471
(Muffled screams)

37:41.510 --> 37:43.971
(Moans)

38:18.797 --> 38:20.924
(Telephone rings)

38:29.224 --> 38:30.392
Barbara?

38:30.517 --> 38:31.893
No, he still isn't in.

38:32.019 --> 38:33.687
No, not a word.

38:34.604 --> 38:36.815
Well, I don't know.
I haven't seen him.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.984
Well, I don't know.
You tell me what happened in there.

38:39.109 --> 38:42.446
I don't know. He's... he's not here.
What do you want me to tell you?

39:43.882 --> 39:45.801
Good God!

39:47.427 --> 39:49.513
What the hell happened tonight?

39:50.430 --> 39:51.640
(Morris) You fool!

39:52.140 --> 39:54.601
You're feeding him human brains.

39:54.726 --> 39:57.521
You're making him strong.

39:58.063 --> 40:02.692
I knew someone in the building had him,
but I didn't think it was you.

40:02.818 --> 40:05.237
Where is he?
Is he on you now?

40:05.946 --> 40:07.239
I don't know what you're talking about.

40:07.364 --> 40:09.950
Nor do you know
what you're dealing with.

40:10.075 --> 40:13.286
You're an amateur.
It takes years to control him.

40:13.412 --> 40:16.456
He'll drain you.
Use you till you waste away.

40:16.998 --> 40:18.917
Yeah?
Then what do you want him for?

40:19.042 --> 40:22.504
Because he's mine.
Aylmer belongs to me.

40:23.964 --> 40:25.298
"Elmer"?

40:25.424 --> 40:27.509
You fucking named him "Elmer"?

40:27.926 --> 40:29.469
Not "Elmer".

40:29.594 --> 40:30.846
Aylmer.

40:30.971 --> 40:33.265
A-Y-L-M-E-R.

40:33.390 --> 40:37.936
An Old English word meaning
"the awe-inspiring famous one".

40:38.061 --> 40:39.771
And that he is, indeed.

40:39.896 --> 40:43.316
For the Aylmer is a creature
of endless histories.

40:43.442 --> 40:47.654
A living relic of civilizations
long since forgotten.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.156
You're crazy.

40:49.281 --> 40:50.699
Am I?

40:50.824 --> 40:54.578
The Aylmer's origins can be traced back
to the Fourth Crusade

40:54.703 --> 40:56.997
where he was snatched
from the Emperor Alexius

40:57.122 --> 41:00.417
during the sack of Byzantium in 1203.

41:00.542 --> 41:04.004
It's believed a Venetian mercenary
named Matteo Grimaldi

41:04.129 --> 41:05.714
brought the creature to Europe,

41:05.839 --> 41:08.675
but he had to surrender it
almost immediately

41:08.800 --> 41:10.927
to a renegade cardinal, a Borgia

41:11.052 --> 41:14.473
who wanted the Aylmer all to himself.

41:14.598 --> 41:19.603
In 1699, the Aylmer reappeared in the
possession of one Don Manuel Perolta,

41:19.728 --> 41:22.772
a Spanish viceroy and freelance corsair.

41:22.898 --> 41:27.319
He lost the Aylmer to a Portuguese admiral
off the Barbary Coast

41:27.444 --> 41:30.489
who himself was murdered within days

41:30.614 --> 41:35.660
by a young midshipman
who fled with his prize to Africa.

41:36.620 --> 41:41.208
There the Aylmer quickly fell
into the hands of a Mabootoo chief

41:41.333 --> 41:46.880
whose tribe placed a deep religious value
in the Aylmer's many talents.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.799
Then, during the Second World War,

41:49.925 --> 41:53.720
a German munitions tycoon
bribed a battalion commander

41:53.845 --> 41:56.598
to obtain the Aylmer for himself.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.352
It didn't work out that way.

42:00.477 --> 42:03.146
The Aylmer was brought to Berlin all right,

42:03.271 --> 42:07.400
but he passed from host to host
for over three decades

42:07.526 --> 42:09.653
until I tracked him down.

42:09.778 --> 42:13.406
Until I paid for him
in both money and blood.

42:13.532 --> 42:15.450
Until I made him mine.

42:15.575 --> 42:18.578
- You're out of your mind.
- Give him to me!

42:21.289 --> 42:23.416
He's mine, damn you.

42:23.542 --> 42:25.627
Mine! Mine!

42:25.752 --> 42:28.547
Mine, mine! Mine!

42:28.672 --> 42:30.632
Mine, mine, mine!

42:34.761 --> 42:36.179
Brian?

42:37.013 --> 42:39.182
Hey, Brian, where were you?

42:39.307 --> 42:43.311
Hey, Barbara's been calling.
She's called a couple of times already.

42:43.436 --> 42:47.023
She's all upset and crying.
What happened with you two tonight?

43:04.416 --> 43:06.418
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

43:06.543 --> 43:08.128
We've gotta get out of here.

43:08.253 --> 43:09.379
"We"? Who's "we"?

43:09.504 --> 43:12.424
Me and Elmer, or Ulmer,
or whatever the hell he's called.

43:12.549 --> 43:13.883
Who are you talking about?

43:14.009 --> 43:15.844
The old man is right.
I've got to be in control.

43:15.969 --> 43:18.388
- What old man?
- I've got to be in charge.

43:19.848 --> 43:22.267
Look, Brian, I know
this is kind of tough for you,

43:22.392 --> 43:25.520
but could you try making sense
for just a couple of minutes, please?

43:25.645 --> 43:28.398
I've got to sort things out.
I've got to be in control.

43:30.525 --> 43:34.029
Look, Brian, if you're in trouble,
if you need help, talk to me.

43:34.154 --> 43:36.197
I'm your brother.
I'll help you.

43:36.323 --> 43:38.199
Barbara will help you.

43:38.325 --> 43:40.660
But we can't help you
if you won't talk to us.

43:40.785 --> 43:43.496
We can't help you
if you're just going to run away.

43:43.622 --> 43:45.915
I don't have time.
I've got to get out of here fast.

43:46.041 --> 43:47.959
And go where?

43:48.084 --> 43:50.670
Hey, Brian, hold it.

43:50.795 --> 43:52.839
(Door slams shut)

43:52.964 --> 43:55.842
You forgot your buckets.

44:34.631 --> 44:35.840
(Lock clicks)

44:59.656 --> 45:03.118
What a nice room, Brian.
This is a real classy place.

45:04.619 --> 45:07.372
We've got to talk.
You've got to answer some questions.

45:07.497 --> 45:09.708
- Like what?
- Like that old man.

45:09.833 --> 45:11.710
Was anything he said true?

45:11.835 --> 45:13.461
Aw, stupid old fool.

45:13.586 --> 45:15.255
Kept me weak
by feeding me animal brains

45:15.380 --> 45:18.049
while they drained me
like two shrivelled parasites.

45:18.174 --> 45:20.552
They kept me weak,
but I still left them.

45:20.677 --> 45:22.595
Is that what you want, Brian?
Want me to leave you, too?

45:23.138 --> 45:25.974
- No, no. I just, I just...
- Damn right you don't.

45:26.099 --> 45:28.393
So what are we doing here?

45:28.518 --> 45:29.936
Look, I just want to sort things out.

45:30.061 --> 45:33.732
You've got me so I can't think clearly.
I can't function clearly.

45:33.857 --> 45:35.567
And I thought you were having
such a good time.

45:35.692 --> 45:37.736
I was, I...

45:37.861 --> 45:39.279
I am, but...

45:40.155 --> 45:43.116
But I think something awful happened
last night, and I can't remember it.

45:43.241 --> 45:46.619
I don't remember where I went
or who I met or what I did.

45:46.745 --> 45:49.247
All I remember is feeling
something sticky in my pants

45:49.372 --> 45:51.541
and finding them covered in blood.

45:51.666 --> 45:53.001
And not my blood.

45:53.126 --> 45:57.088
Part of my talent, Brian,
is to spare you any unpleasantness.

45:57.213 --> 45:59.257
Yeah, but when it comes to
blood in my underwear,

45:59.382 --> 46:00.925
I want to know how it got there.

46:01.050 --> 46:02.802
Well, it's no big deal.

46:02.927 --> 46:04.804
Nothing to get upset about.

46:04.929 --> 46:06.473
It came from that girl at the club.

46:06.598 --> 46:07.974
What girl?

46:08.099 --> 46:09.851
The girl whose brains I ate.

46:09.976 --> 46:11.269
What?

46:11.394 --> 46:14.147
The blood came from the girl
whose brains I sucked out.

46:14.731 --> 46:16.357
You sucked out her brains?

46:16.483 --> 46:18.318
Yeah.
Right through her mouth.

46:18.443 --> 46:20.695
- Is she dead?
- Of course she's dead.

46:20.820 --> 46:22.071
What, are you kidding?

46:22.197 --> 46:24.449
What are you telling me?
That we killed someone last night?

46:24.574 --> 46:26.284
You really don't remember any of it?

46:26.409 --> 46:28.077
No, no, I don't.

46:28.203 --> 46:29.996
How about the nightwatchman?
Remember him?

46:30.121 --> 46:32.874
- The nightwatchman?
- Yeah. (Burps)

46:32.999 --> 46:35.376
Sucked him dry in the junkyard.
First night we went out.

46:35.502 --> 46:37.212
Oh, my God.

46:37.337 --> 46:39.339
- Want to hear the details?
- No!

46:40.465 --> 46:42.550
You're a wreck, Brian.
You've got to relax.

46:42.675 --> 46:45.386
Why don't you put me on your neck
and calm down?

46:45.512 --> 46:47.764
- No way. It's not going to happen again.
- What isn't?

46:47.889 --> 46:49.057
Killing people.

46:49.182 --> 46:50.809
Oh. (Laughs)

46:50.934 --> 46:52.769
I thought you meant getting high.

46:52.894 --> 46:56.898
We can't keep killing people
every time you're hungry.

46:57.023 --> 46:58.942
Oh, yes we can.

46:59.067 --> 47:01.027
We'll do anything I want us to do.

47:01.152 --> 47:02.946
You're mine now, Brian.

47:03.071 --> 47:04.948
I own you.

47:08.284 --> 47:09.702
(Groans)

47:09.828 --> 47:11.538
Tacky, Brian, tacky.

47:12.288 --> 47:15.124
Yeah, well, from now on, I'm the one
who's gonna be calling the shots.

47:15.250 --> 47:17.335
I'm the one who's going to be in control.

47:17.460 --> 47:21.172
You're not strong enough, Brian.
Your chemistry has changed.

47:21.297 --> 47:24.884
Yeah? Well, then we'll stay here
until I get strong enough.

47:25.009 --> 47:26.678
Till I get your goddamn fluid
out of my system.

47:26.803 --> 47:30.265
- Then we're going to do things my way.
- Just like all the others, aren't you?

47:30.390 --> 47:31.975
Maybe I should put you
in some kind of container.

47:32.100 --> 47:33.643
Oh, don't worry, Brian.

47:33.768 --> 47:36.437
I won't bite you while you're asleep.
No, no, no, no.

47:36.563 --> 47:38.857
I want you to beg for it now.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.109
Just like you're going to beg for a brain.

47:41.693 --> 47:43.778
Good.
A little contest.

47:43.903 --> 47:46.531
I don't get a brain,
you don't get my juice.

47:46.656 --> 47:48.950
We'll just see who cracks first.

47:49.659 --> 47:51.536
Yeah, well, we'll just see.

47:54.289 --> 47:56.666
(Brian coughs)

47:56.791 --> 47:59.294
(Aylmer) What's the matter, Brian?
Feeling ill?

47:59.419 --> 48:01.713
Shut up! (Retching)

48:01.838 --> 48:04.757
Oh, please, Brian, you're not going to
throw up in front of me, are you?

48:04.883 --> 48:06.342
I don't want to watch this.

48:06.467 --> 48:09.512
Why did you bring me here?
Why couldn't you leave me home?

48:09.637 --> 48:11.598
I'll tell you why, Brian.

48:11.723 --> 48:14.767
It's cos you know
you're not going to win.

48:14.893 --> 48:18.354
- (Retching)
- You know you're going to need my juice.

48:18.479 --> 48:20.064
(Aylmer laughs)

48:20.189 --> 48:21.774
Oh...
Oh, God.

48:21.900 --> 48:25.320
You know the pain is going to get so big
that only my juice will stop it.

48:25.445 --> 48:27.989
- Make it stop.
- Only my juice will help you.

48:28.114 --> 48:30.199
You know that, don't you, Brian?

48:30.325 --> 48:33.244
Deep down inside you know that.

48:33.369 --> 48:35.705
(Sobbing)

48:42.211 --> 48:46.758
Hey, Brian, why don't we go out tonight
and get us some girls?

48:46.883 --> 48:48.343
Yeah, that's a swell idea.

48:48.468 --> 48:50.887
Let's go up to 33rd Street
and get us some hookers.

48:51.012 --> 48:53.306
Get ourselves a car and pile them in.
(Laughs)

48:53.431 --> 48:57.393
Boy, oh, boy, I could eat a million
of them tonight. (Laughs)

49:02.690 --> 49:04.567
Uh...

49:05.777 --> 49:08.071
(Groans)

49:12.992 --> 49:14.911
Oh, my G...

49:17.372 --> 49:19.290
Oh...

49:20.249 --> 49:22.460
Uh... eww!

49:25.046 --> 49:26.255
Uh...

49:26.923 --> 49:28.549
Eww!

49:32.637 --> 49:33.930
Uh...

49:35.807 --> 49:37.600
Oh...!

49:37.725 --> 49:39.352
Uh! Uh!

49:39.477 --> 49:41.437
Oh! Oh!

49:41.562 --> 49:43.606
Oh! Oh!

49:43.731 --> 49:46.234
(Screams)

49:54.784 --> 49:55.785
(Strains)

49:57.620 --> 50:01.874
Uh-oh, Brian, now you're really
losing your mind.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.419
(Screams)

50:14.262 --> 50:17.306
(Aylmer laughs hysterically)

50:28.359 --> 50:30.028
Oh, my!

50:30.153 --> 50:32.196
Well, well!

50:34.115 --> 50:36.367
Ready to beg for it, Brian?

50:36.492 --> 50:40.371
Ready to crawl across the floor
and plead for my juice?

50:40.496 --> 50:41.622
No?

50:41.748 --> 50:43.583
Not yet? Well...

50:43.708 --> 50:46.252
Give it a few more hours, Brian.

50:46.377 --> 50:49.839
Whenever you want the pain to stop,
I'll be here.

50:51.049 --> 50:54.427
Whenever you want to stop hurting,
you come to me.

50:55.762 --> 50:59.974
When the pain gets so great
you think you're turning inside out,

51:00.099 --> 51:02.393
just ask for my juice.

51:02.518 --> 51:04.520
Come to me when you're ready, Brian.

51:04.645 --> 51:07.106
Come to me and get my juice.

51:21.037 --> 51:25.666
(Aylmer) â™ª Why are the stars
always winking and blinking above

51:25.792 --> 51:30.004
â™ª What makes a fellow
start thinking of falling in love

51:30.129 --> 51:31.881
â™ª It's not the season

51:32.006 --> 51:35.051
â™ª The reason is plain as the moon

51:35.176 --> 51:39.097
â™ª It's just Aylmer's tune

51:39.222 --> 51:43.643
â™ª What makes a lady of 80
go out on the loose?

51:43.768 --> 51:48.272
â™ª Why does a gander meander
in search of a goose?

51:48.397 --> 51:53.027
â™ª What puts the kick in a chicken,
the magic in June?

51:53.152 --> 51:57.323
â™ª It's just Aylmer's tune

51:57.448 --> 51:59.784
- â™ª Listen...
- Help me.

51:59.909 --> 52:02.078
- â™ª Oh, listen...
- Please.

52:02.203 --> 52:06.624
- â™ª There's a lot you're liable to be missin'
- Please help me.

52:06.749 --> 52:08.751
- â™ª Sing it
- I need it.

52:08.876 --> 52:10.711
- â™ª Swing it
- Juice...

52:10.837 --> 52:15.091
â™ª Any old way and any old time

52:15.216 --> 52:19.554
â™ª The hurdy-gurdies, the birdies,
the cop on the beat

52:19.679 --> 52:24.267
â™ª The candy-maker, the baker,
the man on the street

52:24.392 --> 52:29.147
â™ª The city charmer, the farmer,
the man in the moon

52:29.272 --> 52:32.775
â™ª All sing Aylmer's tune â™ª

52:32.900 --> 52:35.153
(Laughs)

52:36.571 --> 52:38.990
Why, hello, Brian.
How are you? How are you doing?

52:39.115 --> 52:41.450
Help me.
Please, help me.

52:41.576 --> 52:44.036
Hey, of course I'll help you, Brian.

52:44.162 --> 52:46.247
You and I are pals.

52:46.372 --> 52:48.583
I'll be happy to help you.

52:48.708 --> 52:50.918
But you'll have to feed me first.

52:51.043 --> 52:53.629
(Laughs)

53:02.388 --> 53:04.265
(Lock clicks)

53:15.401 --> 53:16.986
(Banging)

53:35.504 --> 53:37.340
(Banging)

53:46.349 --> 53:48.017
(Coughs)

54:17.255 --> 54:18.923
(Groans)

54:24.470 --> 54:27.723
(Sobbing)

54:29.767 --> 54:30.851
(Banging)

54:32.144 --> 54:35.815
(Man) You read the newspapers,
you listen to the TV news.

54:35.940 --> 54:39.026
Talking about nuclear waste,
talking about nuclear bombs.

54:39.151 --> 54:41.737
Nuclear war. (Chuckles)

54:42.363 --> 54:44.740
They're crying all over the place.

54:44.865 --> 54:47.785
They're crying in America,
they're crying in Europe.

54:47.910 --> 54:50.162
The whole world's
gonna come to an end.

54:50.288 --> 54:52.832
If it's gonna go, man, it's gonna go,

54:52.957 --> 54:56.794
and I'm gonna enjoy seeing
this whole friggin' world blow up.

54:56.919 --> 55:00.423
And I'm gonna be smiling
while having my beer.

55:00.548 --> 55:03.592
And I wanna see this last blast, baby.

55:03.718 --> 55:05.511
I wanna see it go.

55:05.636 --> 55:07.430
Are you nervous?

55:12.601 --> 55:15.313
(Shower starts)

55:59.440 --> 56:00.775
Hey, man, you new here?

56:00.900 --> 56:02.443
Mm-hmm.

56:04.028 --> 56:05.112
You OK?

56:05.237 --> 56:06.739
Yeah.

56:08.866 --> 56:11.994
Hey, it's cool.
No one's going to bother you.

56:37.436 --> 56:39.230
(Burping)

56:43.401 --> 56:44.610
What's your problem, man?

56:44.735 --> 56:46.987
Huh?
Uh, nothing.

56:47.113 --> 56:48.739
Everything's fine.

57:23.816 --> 57:25.943
All yours.

57:29.613 --> 57:31.782
Aylmer?
Aylmer? Psst!

57:31.907 --> 57:33.367
Aylmer?

57:34.702 --> 57:36.370
Aylmer?

57:36.495 --> 57:38.414
Psst. Aylmer?

57:56.182 --> 57:58.434
(Flatulating)

58:06.275 --> 58:08.861
Lamont?
Lamont, is that you?

58:14.992 --> 58:16.869
Asshole!

58:18.162 --> 58:19.872
(Screams)

58:43.854 --> 58:46.232
Shh!
Someone's gonna hear.

58:55.533 --> 58:57.618
(Whimpers)

59:04.166 --> 59:06.544
(Whimpers)

59:45.666 --> 59:46.667
(Lock clicks)

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:08.814
(Lock clicks)

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:14.278
Thanks for putting up with me tonight.
I really needed to be with someone.

01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:16.113
I'm glad you called.

01:00:16.238 --> 01:00:17.865
I only wish there was more I could do.

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:21.785
Well, we checked with all his friends.
I don't know where else we could look.

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:25.039
Yeah, Dad called again last night.
He sounded really worried.

01:00:25.164 --> 01:00:27.041
I didn't know what to tell him.

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:30.502
I can't deal with being dumped like this.

01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:35.591
When you're close to someone,
you think you mean something to them.

01:00:35.716 --> 01:00:39.720
It hurts to be so easily discarded like this.

01:00:41.013 --> 01:00:44.141
I feel so worthless and shitty.

01:00:44.767 --> 01:00:47.686
- And stupid.
- Stop it!

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:50.356
You're a very special lady,

01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:54.485
and if Brian doesn't see it anymore,
well, I do.

01:00:54.610 --> 01:00:56.028
Don't. Don't...

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.405
Look, you know
how I feel about you.

01:00:59.615 --> 01:01:02.409
I only stayed away
because of Brian, but...

01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:04.745
if it's really over between you...

01:01:05.913 --> 01:01:07.915
I mean, if he's really left you...

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.792
No, don't.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.922
Want me to take you home?

01:01:17.091 --> 01:01:18.717
(Barbara) No.

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:21.762
I want to stay.

01:01:43.534 --> 01:01:45.786
(Barbara moaning)

01:03:04.782 --> 01:03:07.326
(Moaning)

01:03:58.794 --> 01:03:59.920
Shh!

01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:02.089
Yoo-hoo, Brian.

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:16.562
(Gasps)

01:04:30.826 --> 01:04:33.370
(Moaning intensifies)

01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:40.145
(Moaning)

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.522
(Brian growling)

01:05:58.330 --> 01:05:59.748
Brian?

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:02.000
Oh, my God, Brian.

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:05.545
Where were you?
Where have you been?

01:06:05.671 --> 01:06:07.756
Oh, Jesus, Brian.

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:10.133
- You both have to get out of here.
- (Mike) Now, wait a minute.

01:06:10.258 --> 01:06:11.885
(Barbara) Hold it, Brian,
this isn't what you...

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:14.137
You both have to be gone
when I get back.

01:06:14.262 --> 01:06:17.933
Goddammit, Brian. You can't just
disappear and expect nothing to happen.

01:06:18.058 --> 01:06:20.727
- You can't expect everyone to just...
- He's hungry again.

01:06:20.852 --> 01:06:23.689
He ate a little while ago,
but he's hungry again.

01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:25.107
(Barbara) What?

01:06:25.232 --> 01:06:28.568
And when he gets hungry,
someone gets killed.

01:06:28.694 --> 01:06:31.321
- "Killed"?
- When who gets hungry?

01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:32.948
Both of us.

01:06:33.073 --> 01:06:37.160
He needs the brains, but I need his juice.
It's as simple as that.

01:06:37.285 --> 01:06:40.122
I tried to fight him,
but I can't.

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:44.876
- I can't. I can't.
- What the hell are you talking about?

01:06:45.002 --> 01:06:47.254
And I can't cope with the killing.

01:06:47.379 --> 01:06:51.133
I can't cope with knowing
I'm going to kill someone.

01:06:51.258 --> 01:06:54.094
So I'll just take his juice
and never have to know.

01:06:55.721 --> 01:06:58.515
But then I also won't know
if it's you or not.

01:06:59.558 --> 01:07:03.353
If I'm high,
I won't know the difference.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:07.816
And I don't want it to be you.

01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:11.403
Either of you.

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:15.490
I don't want it to be you.

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:29.504
- Get away from me.
- Brian, hold it.

01:07:29.629 --> 01:07:30.881
Leave me alone!

01:07:31.006 --> 01:07:33.258
One brain's as good as the next.

01:09:39.176 --> 01:09:42.136
Brian, you don't have to say anything.
You don't have to look at me.

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:43.638
But listen to me, please.

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:46.933
I know you're in trouble.

01:09:47.058 --> 01:09:49.895
I know something's happened to you.
I know you need help.

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.270
I just... I just...

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:52.772
(Burps)

01:09:57.319 --> 01:09:58.737
Jesus, Brian!

01:09:58.862 --> 01:10:01.031
I thought you and I were having trouble
with our relationship.

01:10:01.156 --> 01:10:04.201
I didn't think you'd be talking about
getting killed or killing someone or...

01:10:04.326 --> 01:10:06.161
(Burps)

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:36.066
I can understand
you being upset with me.

01:10:36.191 --> 01:10:39.527
I realize we have some problems
with our relationship.

01:10:39.653 --> 01:10:43.698
But first, Brian, first you need help.

01:10:44.324 --> 01:10:48.703
I've never seen anyone change as
drastically and as suddenly as you have.

01:10:48.828 --> 01:10:50.705
You're like a total stranger to me now.

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:54.751
I'll be damned if I'm just going to walk off
and let you rot away.

01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:57.671
I can't sit by and watch you disintegrate.

01:10:57.796 --> 01:11:01.049
Brian, you're telling me
you're going to kill someone

01:11:01.174 --> 01:11:04.135
and you don't even realize
you're killing yourself.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:08.014
I wish I knew what to say
to get through to you.

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:10.517
I don't want anything to happen to you.

01:11:10.642 --> 01:11:13.603
I was mad before.
I was angry.

01:11:13.728 --> 01:11:16.022
That was because
I thought you were gone.

01:11:16.690 --> 01:11:18.441
I don't want to lose you, Brian.

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:20.902
I don't want to lose you.

01:11:22.404 --> 01:11:23.989
Brian...

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:31.955
(Gurgling, Barbara groaning)

01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:57.772
(Sighs)

01:11:57.897 --> 01:12:00.191
(Barbara groaning)

01:13:57.892 --> 01:13:59.269
(Gun clicks)

01:13:59.394 --> 01:14:02.105
We want it back.
We want it back now.

01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:04.023
- You can't. He's...
- Put your hands up.

01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:08.236
And get against the wall.
Blink your eyes and you're dead.

01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:10.488
- (Door opens)
- What the hell's going on out here?

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:17.203
Move it.

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.927
Listen, I really need him.

01:14:33.052 --> 01:14:34.679
I'll get sick.

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:42.854
Aylmer.

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:45.273
Oh, Aylmer.

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:46.816
Oh.

01:14:46.941 --> 01:14:48.485
Aylmer.

01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:49.652
Aylmer.

01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:51.529
Quick.
Bring him to me.

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:53.531
Hurry. Hurry.

01:14:54.699 --> 01:14:56.701
- Give him to me, you stupid fool.
- No.

01:14:58.786 --> 01:15:00.914
Oh... Aylmer.

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:03.791
Aylmer. Aylmer.

01:15:03.917 --> 01:15:06.336
- (Growls)
- (Screams)

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:28.650
No!

01:15:41.412 --> 01:15:44.249
(Screaming continues)

01:16:00.848 --> 01:16:03.351
(Aylmer laughs)

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:19.033
(Morris screaming)

01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:08.833
Oh, Jesus, God,
let's get out of here.

01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:13.504
I'm not finished.

01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:15.673
(Munching)

01:17:16.591 --> 01:17:19.302
I think...
I think I'm going to be sick.

01:17:20.428 --> 01:17:22.388
OK, hold it.

01:17:22.513 --> 01:17:24.557
Put me on your neck.
Hurry up.

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:09.185
(Gurgling)

01:18:19.487 --> 01:18:22.156
(Screaming)

01:18:51.102 --> 01:18:53.604
(Retching)

01:19:01.654 --> 01:19:03.656
(Retching)

01:19:05.867 --> 01:19:07.869
(Burping)

01:19:30.475 --> 01:19:33.144
(Retching)

01:19:54.457 --> 01:19:56.542
(Groaning)

01:19:57.543 --> 01:19:59.212
Argh!

01:20:07.845 --> 01:20:10.223
(Screams)

01:20:15.728 --> 01:20:18.105
('Telephone rings')

01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:26.322
- (Banging)
- Barbara?

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:30.868
(Banging continues,
Brian groaning)

01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:36.457
(Groans, screams)

01:20:54.976 --> 01:20:57.228
(Screams)

01:20:58.771 --> 01:21:00.857
(Shouting)

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:04.151
(Gunshot)

01:21:04.277 --> 01:21:06.946
(Whirring, humming)

01:21:20.418 --> 01:21:22.086
Brian!

01:25:36.882 --> 01:25:38.592
(Aylmer) We'll do it again. (Chuckles)
