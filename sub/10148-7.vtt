WEBVTT

01:12.949 --> 01:14.283
Bennie, are you in?

01:14.742 --> 01:16.744
Come on, Bennie, I can't wait all night.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.871
I understand your impatience, Lula,

01:18.955 --> 01:20.790
but it's a difficult position I'm in.

01:21.791 --> 01:24.168
To bet or not to bet.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.337
<i>Better make up your mm, mm.</i>

01:26.587 --> 01:27.505
Yeah, man,

01:27.588 --> 01:29.924
a mind is a terrible thing
not to make up.

01:30.007 --> 01:32.760
And I got places to go
and people to rob.

01:32.843 --> 01:33.843
We all do.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.191
I... I... I think I heard something.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.317
Did anyone else?

01:48.401 --> 01:50.611
That ain't gonna
save you, Bennie boy.

01:50.695 --> 01:52.280
Jason.Jusfln.

01:53.531 --> 01:55.491
Go check. And be thorough.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.153
Two cards. Yes, two cards.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.323
Hey, who threw that...

03:29.543 --> 03:31.045
Up to your old tricks, I see.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.422
It's not what it looks like, I swear.

03:34.090 --> 03:36.425
You want this back? It's all yours.

03:36.509 --> 03:37.968
No, you can't.

03:38.260 --> 03:39.260
Watch me.

03:45.226 --> 03:47.603
Well, that's darn nice of you.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.480
But it's not enough now.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.029
Idiot.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.088
What?

04:51.917 --> 04:53.127
A bunch of gangsters

04:53.210 --> 04:55.087
and a pile of credits and jewelry,
YOU say?

04:55.171 --> 04:56.839
There were some
gold ingots in there, too.

04:57.256 --> 04:58.924
This brings back some memories.

04:59.925 --> 05:00.968
Wanna share them?

05:01.051 --> 05:03.637
Sounds like you got a little too close
to the Derby.

05:03.929 --> 05:06.599
It's a high-stakes poker game
that's been floating around Gotham

05:06.682 --> 05:08.142
since before even my time.

05:08.434 --> 05:12.438
As you noticed, it attracts
some of our most colorful citizens.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.648
You'd think they could afford
better security.

05:14.940 --> 05:18.360
They probably figured no one would be
crazy enough to try to rob them.

05:18.444 --> 05:19.528
Ten's not crazy.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.863
Desperate's more like it.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.199
Sounds like simple greed to me.

05:23.282 --> 05:25.534
No, she swore that
it wasn't what it looked like.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.913
She meant it. I could tell.

05:29.497 --> 05:32.625
Ah, to be young again, and gullible.

05:36.962 --> 05:37.962
I'm home!

05:39.340 --> 05:40.508
Mom? Matt?

05:45.387 --> 05:48.265
"Terry, today was beach day, remember?
Where were you?"

05:48.724 --> 05:50.351
Oh, just out saving the world, Ma.

05:53.312 --> 05:54.438
Remember me?

05:55.856 --> 05:56.856
Melanie.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.319
Or should I say, "Ten."

06:01.195 --> 06:02.821
If you hate me, I understand.

06:02.905 --> 06:05.199
What I did to you before,
I didn't have a choice.

06:05.783 --> 06:07.201
It was between you and my family.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.286
There's always a choice, Melanie.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.085
I need a place to stay till it's dark.

06:16.669 --> 06:18.045
That's all I'm asking for.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.964
Let me guess. Cops after you?

06:20.047 --> 06:21.048
Among others.

06:21.257 --> 06:22.466
Including Batman.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.885
But even he would never think
of looking for me here.

06:24.969 --> 06:26.637
No, I guess he wouldn't.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.949
But there are laws
against harboring criminals, and I'm...

06:28.973 --> 06:31.559
I'm not a criminal. Not anymore.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.310
Then why is everybody after you?

06:33.394 --> 06:37.064
Because I was forced to rob
a big poker game by the Jokerz.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.233
They're holding my family.

06:39.817 --> 06:41.694
I think we'd better call the police.

06:41.902 --> 06:42.903
Don't you get it?

06:43.279 --> 06:45.364
If I do that, the Jokerz will kill them.

06:50.661 --> 06:51.661
Hello?

06:51.912 --> 06:52.913
Dana, hL

06:54.123 --> 06:55.874
Oh, yeah, tonight. History homework.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.042
No, no, I didn't forget it.

06:57.126 --> 06:59.378
It's just that
there's a change of plans.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.590
Yeah. Tomorrow night
would be a lot better, thanks.

07:02.673 --> 07:03.673
Bye.

07:22.985 --> 07:25.613
There's an old saying,
"Once burned, twice shy."

07:25.988 --> 07:27.406
Is that what you're feeling now?

07:27.489 --> 07:30.159
No, but you did burn me... bad.

07:30.576 --> 07:32.995
I don't suppose an apology
would put everything back

07:33.078 --> 07:34.204
to the way it was before?

07:34.580 --> 07:36.123
Melanie, things have changed.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.668
How? Are you saying
you're not attracted to me anymore?

07:39.752 --> 07:41.253
No. I'm not saying that.

07:43.422 --> 07:44.422
Not at all.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.053
Terry, we're home!

07:49.803 --> 07:50.803
That's my cue.

07:51.764 --> 07:53.682
You can't do this. Not by yourself.

07:53.766 --> 07:54.766
Ihaveto.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.019
But, Terry, thanks for caring.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.069
What are you doing here in the dark?

08:05.152 --> 08:06.403
Watching the sunset.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.655
That was an hour ago.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.073
I know.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.866
But they're gonna do an instant replay.

08:11.450 --> 08:12.450
Really?

08:18.832 --> 08:19.833
<i>Wayne.</i>

08:19.917 --> 08:21.919
<i>It's me.
I've got a history test in the morning.</i>

08:22.002 --> 08:23.796
<i>Mind if I go over to Dana's
to study for it?</i>

08:23.879 --> 08:25.339
Things are quiet out there?

08:25.673 --> 08:27.174
Yeah, very. And you?

08:27.257 --> 08:29.051
Things are always quiet here.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.134
Take the night off.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.057
Instant replay. Yeah, right.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.140
Twip.

08:40.979 --> 08:44.191
Terry, it's not like there's a website
for illegal card games.

08:44.274 --> 08:47.319
I know, but there's gotta be some way
of finding out where the Derby is.

08:47.403 --> 08:48.529
Police reports, maybe?

08:49.446 --> 08:51.824
Wonder if I can get some pictures
from last night.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.368
- Pictures?
- From the surveillance satellites.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.370
That'd tell us exactly where they were.

08:56.453 --> 08:59.206
You can download
from the defense department's computers?

08:59.289 --> 09:01.375
Well, not legally.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.377
So, this is what you blew off Dana for.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.712
I was just talking to her.

09:04.795 --> 09:06.630
You're not gonna say anything to her,
are you?

09:06.714 --> 09:07.714
Do I ever?

09:08.090 --> 09:09.842
But I would like to know
what's going on.

09:10.134 --> 09:12.553
I'm helping a friend. That's all.

09:12.636 --> 09:15.723
With this kind of lying,
it's got to be more than just a friend.

09:15.806 --> 09:16.890
Wish I knew.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.350
Better decide soon.

09:18.726 --> 09:19.935
It ain't fair to Dana.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.520
Here's your photos.

09:24.815 --> 09:25.815
Thanks.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.490
You don't suppose she'll try again,
do you, Tyrus?

09:33.574 --> 09:35.117
Nobody's that stupid.

09:35.576 --> 09:38.912
Maybe we should put the game on hold
for a few days, just in case.

09:38.996 --> 09:40.998
The fact that you're 50 grand down

09:41.081 --> 09:43.250
wouldn't have anything to do with it,
would it, Bennie?

09:43.625 --> 09:44.752
Now shut up and deal.

09:54.511 --> 09:55.804
You're sitting this one out.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.099
Sorry, can't afford to.

10:17.451 --> 10:20.913
I see you and raise you 20,000.

10:40.015 --> 10:42.017
I'm only trying to save my family.

10:42.434 --> 10:43.477
They'll be killed if...

10:43.560 --> 10:44.978
Skip the sob story.

10:45.395 --> 10:46.605
Let's pretend I believe you.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.732
Then let me go get the ransom money.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.066
Please.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.108
No.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.151
No more stealing.

10:52.194 --> 10:54.112
You're killing my family.

10:54.196 --> 10:55.196
I'm saving them.

11:04.540 --> 11:05.540
[Uaughs]

11:05.916 --> 11:08.252
This is where the note said
they had my family.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.630
I thought about breaking in,
but there were just too many of them.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.173
And there still are.

11:13.632 --> 11:14.967
Even for the two of us.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.594
So why don't you just
let me go back to the card game?

11:18.220 --> 11:19.721
It would be a lot safer than this.

11:20.138 --> 11:23.183
Like I said before, no more stealing.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.646
This is for a kid named Terry McGinnis.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.606
If you come out of this okay

11:30.274 --> 11:32.526
and I don't, will you give it to him?

11:33.110 --> 11:35.320
And you won't read it. Promise?

11:36.280 --> 11:37.280
I promise.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.492
Maybe you're not such a jerk after all.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.463
They're probably keeping them
in the meat locker.

11:52.963 --> 11:56.550
Honest, babe, I just wanna show you
the constellations.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.229
[Uaughs]

12:24.161 --> 12:25.161
Watch my back.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.935
The Royal Flush Gang. Where are they?

12:48.352 --> 12:50.312
I don't know. They don't hang with us.

12:50.771 --> 12:51.897
You kidnapped them.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.065
We what?

13:45.701 --> 13:47.077
<i>Thought you might need this.</i>

13:51.832 --> 13:53.500
<i>I tried to reach you at Dana's,</i>

13:53.583 --> 13:56.420
<i>and when you weren't there,
I switched on the suit's tracer.</i>

13:56.503 --> 13:58.296
Guess I've got
some explaining to do. Huh?

13:58.922 --> 13:59.923
<i>Guess you do.</i>

14:49.389 --> 14:50.223
OW!

14:50.348 --> 14:51.641
What was that for?

14:51.725 --> 14:53.101
For saying, "I told you so."

14:53.185 --> 14:55.062
- But I didn't.
- Well, you were gonna.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.529
And if I told you what I was gonna do
you wouldn't have let me.

15:04.946 --> 15:05.946
You didn't trust her.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.908
<i>And rightfully so, it seems.</i>

15:07.991 --> 15:09.409
Okay, I was wrong.

15:09.493 --> 15:11.573
The only thing I did right
was stick a tracer on her.

15:11.620 --> 15:12.829
<i>Live and learn, kid.</i>

15:13.288 --> 15:15.457
That's it?
That's all you have to say to me?

15:15.540 --> 15:16.416
<i>For the moment.</i>

15:16.500 --> 15:18.877
<i>Now, Why don 't you see
if you can locate her frequency?</i>

15:59.584 --> 16:00.794
Here's the ransom.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.420
Now let my family go.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.134
Well done, darling.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.386
Dad? Where are the Jokerz?

16:09.469 --> 16:11.346
There never were any Jokerz.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.640
This was just a family thing.

16:13.890 --> 16:14.975
Family?

16:15.475 --> 16:17.060
What are you talking about?

16:17.144 --> 16:19.271
After the last time,
we weren't sure of you.

16:19.521 --> 16:21.022
Weren't sure we could trust you.

16:21.439 --> 16:22.899
But you just proved yourself.

16:23.358 --> 16:24.484
Congratulations.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.319
What's wrong, darling?

16:26.653 --> 16:27.653
"What's wrong?"

16:28.113 --> 16:29.656
How could you do this to me?

16:29.739 --> 16:31.241
Melanie, listen.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.952
Your mother and I love you very much.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.580
But we needed to make sure you loved us.

16:36.663 --> 16:37.998
You <i>don't</i> love me.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.000
If you did,
you wouldn't have done this to me.

16:40.083 --> 16:43.170
And you never would have made me choose
between the family and Terry.

16:43.587 --> 16:44.754
You would've accepted him.

16:45.088 --> 16:46.173
You were too young.

16:46.590 --> 16:48.258
Age had nothing to do with it.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.052
You were afraid I'd leave the gang.
That's what it was.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.763
All I've ever been to you
is an accomplice.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.098
Never a daughter.

16:55.724 --> 16:59.436
I just wish it hadn't taken me
so long to realize it.

16:59.811 --> 17:00.811
How sweet.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.814
A family reunion.

17:03.940 --> 17:04.858
Wait!

17:04.941 --> 17:06.276
Wait? For what?

17:06.568 --> 17:07.736
Jack! Ace!

17:12.073 --> 17:13.073
No!

17:18.538 --> 17:20.123
Better choose your side, Melanie.

17:20.332 --> 17:21.458
And choose well.

17:53.865 --> 17:54.865
Ahh!

18:03.416 --> 18:05.126
It appears you're outnumbered.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.210
Not really.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.338
I tipped off some friends of yours
on the way over.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.965
Told them who robbed their game.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.627
I also tipped off the cops.

19:33.256 --> 19:34.256
Your deal, King.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.303
- Two please.
- Forty-six credits.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.681
Terry, if you need some credits...

20:24.015 --> 20:25.850
It's okay. I've got a few in my pack.

20:25.934 --> 20:26.934
Ihope.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.570
What's that piece of paper?

20:37.654 --> 20:39.447
It's... nothing.
