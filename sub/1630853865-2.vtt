[music continues]

00:28.945 --> 00:29.946
They're here.

00:31.489 --> 00:32.532
Uncle Dunc!

00:32.615 --> 00:35.577
Hey, you're a sight
for road-weary eyes. Aw.

00:35.660 --> 00:38.413
-You're my favorite uncle.
-I'm your only uncle.

00:38.496 --> 00:39.998
-[Nina] Hi.
-Hello.

00:40.749 --> 00:41.666
[Duncan grunts]

00:42.459 --> 00:43.543
[Kinsey] How was the drive?

00:43.626 --> 00:47.172
Oh, filled with lots of
spirited wedding playlist discussion.

00:47.255 --> 00:50.467
Mm-hmm. Brian vetoed all yacht rock,
so basically, the wedding's off now,

00:50.550 --> 00:53.553
which is a shame
because this place looks great.

00:53.636 --> 00:54.846
Did you do that yourself?

00:55.430 --> 00:59.142
Uh… Yeah. Just sort of whipped it up.

00:59.642 --> 01:02.437
-[Brian] It's gorgeous. Everything is.
-[Nina chuckles]

01:03.521 --> 01:04.647
Any word on Tyler?

01:04.731 --> 01:07.901
No. He's not even responding to texts.

01:07.984 --> 01:11.654
Don't worry. I'm gonna be
the best man you've ever had.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.240
Uh, you know, actually,
I didn't ask you to be my best man.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.576
I asked you
to stand up during the ceremony.

01:16.659 --> 01:17.660
Don't worry.

01:18.369 --> 01:20.038
The best man will help.

01:20.121 --> 01:22.707
-Probably just accept this, shouldn't I?
-Probably.

01:22.791 --> 01:23.666
Thank you.

01:23.750 --> 01:27.295
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut.

[dramatic music playing]

02:11.339 --> 02:12.173
Captain.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.220
What--

02:18.138 --> 02:19.514
-Where are--
-Sh, sh.

02:21.015 --> 02:22.809
Samuel Coffey.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.979
[eerie whoosh]

02:28.106 --> 02:29.065
Bolton.

02:30.942 --> 02:31.860
[exhales]

02:31.943 --> 02:35.321
Is that you, Captain?
What in bloody hell's going on?

02:35.405 --> 02:36.573
Stop.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.074
[dramatic music continues]

[cranking and clicking]

02:46.791 --> 02:47.792
[whooshing]

02:53.798 --> 02:56.301
What dark sorcery is this?

02:57.093 --> 02:58.595
Come this way.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.513
This way only.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.016
[dramatic music continues]

03:15.987 --> 03:16.988
Where are we?

03:17.071 --> 03:21.910
The home of Benjamin Locke,
now inhabited by his descendants.

03:23.119 --> 03:24.913
When are we?

03:24.996 --> 03:28.416
Much has changed
since you last drew breath many years ago.

03:28.499 --> 03:32.503
The war you fought was lost
and your lives with it.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.298
-You saying I died?
-[Captain] You both did.

03:36.257 --> 03:39.010
Now you're echoes of your former selves.

03:41.846 --> 03:43.431
Then who the hell are you?

03:45.141 --> 03:46.434
Your captain…

03:48.853 --> 03:50.271
and something more.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.356
[crescendo playing]

04:01.783 --> 04:03.785
[crickets chirping]

04:04.786 --> 04:05.995
[Duncan] Is Kinsey joining us?

04:06.079 --> 04:08.873
[Nina] She's on the phone with the Savinis
chatting about wedding stuff.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.708
Have her friends ever filmed a wedding?

04:10.792 --> 04:14.671
No, but they shot the most
amazing horror film I've ever seen.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.174
It's gonna be epic. Trust me.

04:19.217 --> 04:20.843
-Great.
-Hey, Uncle Dunc.

04:20.927 --> 04:24.222
I have some last-minute
best man duties to attend to.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.140
-Like what? Buddy?
-[Nina chuckles]

04:26.224 --> 04:28.059
-You'll see.
-[sighs]

04:28.142 --> 04:31.312
-At least he's taking it seriously?
-Yeah. That's what worries me.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.313
[Nina laughs]

04:33.022 --> 04:35.733
Well, well, well.

04:36.693 --> 04:37.819
Now does this say Josh?

04:37.902 --> 04:40.655
Ooh. Let me see. Let me see.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.491
Yes, that's the way it looks to me.

04:43.574 --> 04:47.662
-[Brian] This is the Josh?
-It is the Josh. Would you two mind?

04:47.745 --> 04:51.499
Mind? No. Why would we mind?
Just excited to finally meet him.

04:52.375 --> 04:55.837
Well, I'm gonna use
all this nervous energy to go unpack.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.463
-Mm-hmm.
-[both kissing]

04:58.673 --> 05:01.676
[sighs] Thank you again, Nina.
You're really going above and beyond.

05:01.759 --> 05:05.096
Stop. You're family.
We'd do anything for you guys.

05:05.179 --> 05:07.056
[sentimental music playing]

05:10.435 --> 05:11.311
[sucks teeth]

05:13.521 --> 05:16.524
I didn't know there was a Snow Globe Key,
or I definitely would've warned you.

05:16.607 --> 05:18.651
These sisters were insane.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.112
Who knows how long
they were trapped inside of there?

05:21.195 --> 05:24.824
The whole thing was terrifying.
Bode could've frozen to death.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.118
[door knob clicking]

05:27.201 --> 05:28.661
[rattling]

05:30.371 --> 05:31.247
Hello?

05:31.331 --> 05:32.707
[rattles and bangs]

05:33.333 --> 05:34.250
[creaking open]

05:37.628 --> 05:39.714
I, uh, I heard something about a wedding.

05:39.797 --> 05:41.132
-Aw, I had a feeling.
-[chuckles]

05:41.215 --> 05:43.343
I didn't wanna believe it,
but I had a feeling.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.011
-Hey, Mom.
-Oh!

05:45.094 --> 05:46.387
[Duncan] I didn't have a feeling.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.807
I was considering a cardboard cutout
but had a hard time deciding on a photo,

05:49.891 --> 05:53.061
and it made me realize
that I would miss you, oh, even more.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.562
[laughing]

05:55.104 --> 05:57.190
Look at your hair. I like it!

05:57.273 --> 06:00.026
[clears throat] Thanks.
Everything looks great outside.

06:00.109 --> 06:03.071
-Why didn't you tell us you were coming?
-And miss this reaction?

06:03.154 --> 06:05.323
[laughs] There's dinner if you're hungry.

06:05.406 --> 06:07.784
It's pizza. That we ordered.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.535
You really went all out, huh?

06:09.619 --> 06:11.579
-[Duncan laughs]
-Oh! Come here.

06:18.419 --> 06:20.338
Today is a special day.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.092
What? No.

06:25.968 --> 06:26.928
[knocking on door]

06:27.804 --> 06:29.806
[knocking continues]

06:29.889 --> 06:31.557

-[Tyler grunts, gasps]

06:56.290 --> 06:57.208
Tyler?

06:58.042 --> 07:00.086
-Tyler!
-You're back.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.045
[Tyler grunts]

07:01.754 --> 07:03.089
Didn't know I was so missed.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.340
[Kinsey] Of course you were.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.677
[exhales] I'm sorry.
I didn't know that was you.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.928
Why? What happened?

07:09.011 --> 07:12.014
Tried to scare Bode,
and he, like, flipped me like a ninja.

07:12.098 --> 07:15.309
-How'd you get so strong?
-I used the Hercules belt.

07:16.394 --> 07:17.270
What?

07:18.896 --> 07:20.231
Trying out a new look?

07:20.314 --> 07:22.358
Oh, it's vintage.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.904
So, where have you been?
How have you been?

07:26.988 --> 07:29.782
-When did you decide to come back?
-Let's see. Uh…

07:30.616 --> 07:32.201
Montana, fine,

07:32.285 --> 07:34.662
and, uh, I'm not gonna miss
Duncan's wedding.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.998
Hey, stopped in Wisconsin. I got this

07:38.166 --> 07:39.250
for you.

07:39.333 --> 07:40.460
Cheesy.

07:41.002 --> 07:41.836
[squeaking]

07:41.919 --> 07:43.045
Why Montana?

07:43.129 --> 07:44.505
Got a job. [sighs]

07:44.589 --> 07:45.506
A job?

07:45.590 --> 07:47.341
Yeah, framing houses.

07:47.425 --> 07:51.053
All that free labor Mom got out of us
fixing homes finally paid off.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.847
Do you get to use a nail gun?

07:52.930 --> 07:54.056
Sure do.

07:55.141 --> 07:58.102
Uh, Mom's heating up some pizza
if you wanna join?

08:02.273 --> 08:04.609
It'd be so much easier
if he could just remember.

08:04.692 --> 08:07.862
Yeah, but it's not what he wanted.

08:08.863 --> 08:09.822
I know.

08:11.282 --> 08:12.950
But still.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.036

08:19.624 --> 08:22.001
-[clanking]
-[Bolton exhales]

08:26.714 --> 08:28.716
And there are more of these keys?

08:28.799 --> 08:32.553
[Captain] Many…
made by Benjamin Locke's descendants.

08:32.637 --> 08:37.558
Generations of arrogant men and women,

08:37.642 --> 08:41.479
all believing themselves
worthy of such gifts.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.607
You called us Echoes.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.193
But what does that mean?

08:52.448 --> 08:54.450
[suspenseful music playing]

08:58.371 --> 08:59.372
[Captain] Stab him.

09:00.665 --> 09:01.624
What?

09:03.125 --> 09:05.503
-Why?
-Come now. Just asking questions.

09:05.586 --> 09:06.754
I command you.

09:06.837 --> 09:09.340
-[dark music playing]
-[scoffs]

09:12.969 --> 09:14.470
[in demonic voice] Stab him!

09:14.971 --> 09:15.930
[gasps]

09:16.430 --> 09:17.640
[suspenseful music playing]

09:21.519 --> 09:23.521
No, no! No, no! No, no!

09:23.604 --> 09:25.815
[gasps, whimpers]

09:25.898 --> 09:27.692
[dramatic music playing]

09:38.995 --> 09:39.996
[pants]

09:41.455 --> 09:42.748
There's no blood.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.002
I can't believe you stabbed me.

09:50.631 --> 09:54.010
As Echoes, you are impervious to pain,

09:54.093 --> 09:56.220
incapable of physical suffering.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.055
But cross me,

09:59.223 --> 10:01.726
and I will toss you both
back into that well house,

10:01.809 --> 10:04.061
and that would be the end of you.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.068
How'd you get here?

10:11.152 --> 10:12.820
I broke down the barrier

10:13.779 --> 10:15.448
between our world and

10:16.532 --> 10:18.534
worlds far greater than this.

10:19.660 --> 10:22.163
And it was at that place that I merged

10:22.830 --> 10:25.708
with something of unspeakable power.

10:26.917 --> 10:29.670
-Not sure I understand.
-[Captain] You will soon.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.548
If I get my way,
you'll see it for yourself.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.801
Why do you need us?

10:35.885 --> 10:38.763
Because you two
can do something that I cannot.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.473
And what's that?

10:41.557 --> 10:43.059
Take the keys.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.144

12:52.605 --> 12:54.607
[foreboding music playing]

13:02.364 --> 13:03.365
Coffee, Kins?

13:03.449 --> 13:05.493
No, thanks.
I'm gonna stick with my lemon tea.

13:05.576 --> 13:08.412
She's warming up her vocal cords
for the big performance later.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.664
-You're gonna be amazing.
-Eh, no pressure.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.166
Just my wedding day.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.334
[chuckles]

13:13.876 --> 13:16.378
Have you guys noticed the, uh,
the window in the well house?

13:16.462 --> 13:18.088
The bars are all bent.

13:21.592 --> 13:24.220
-Really?
-Yes. Door was hanging open.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.971
-Were you playing in there?
-No.

13:28.265 --> 13:29.183
[Brian] So, Tyler,

13:30.309 --> 13:31.393
back for good?

13:31.936 --> 13:34.980
Uh, no. I'm heading back
to Montana tomorrow.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.233
[Bode] But you just got here.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.569
-Gotta get back for work.
-Seriously?

13:40.653 --> 13:41.487
Yeah.

13:41.987 --> 13:46.867
Well, as you are here, I have a question.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.118
[smacks lips]

13:48.202 --> 13:50.621
Since Bode's gonna be up there with me…

13:50.704 --> 13:52.081
As your best man.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.166
-[chuckles]
-[Duncan] Uh-huh. Uh…

13:54.250 --> 13:58.170
…would you also do me the honor
of standing with me during the ceremony?

13:59.463 --> 14:01.048
The honor would be all mine.

14:01.131 --> 14:03.425
Congratulations on being
my second in command.

14:03.509 --> 14:04.343
[all laugh]

14:04.426 --> 14:06.637
-Okay, let's have a wedding!
-Yeah!

14:06.720 --> 14:08.389
[Nina] Heck yeah! [laughs]
