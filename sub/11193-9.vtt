WEBVTT

00:22.000 --> 00:24.039
That was just a few minutes ago.

00:24.079 --> 00:28.480
Obviously, Kasuf's unburied
the Stargate and is waiting - for me.

00:28.481 --> 00:30.521
One Abydos year to the day.

00:30.559 --> 00:33.396
- They kept their word.
- And I have to keep mine.

00:33.398 --> 00:36.957
Daniel, you said you'd go back there
in a year, with Sha're.

00:36.959 --> 00:40.837
I know. But at least I can tell
her father that I haven't given up.

00:40.838 --> 00:42.664
That I won't give up.

00:42.719 --> 00:46.386
- That she's a Goa'uld?
- Yes.

00:46.996 --> 00:49.037
Does he really need to know that?

00:50.476 --> 00:52.517
Kasuf is family.

00:52.557 --> 00:54.515
I owe it to him.

00:54.557 --> 00:59.235
I have nothing against
your returning to Abydos, Dr. Jackson.

00:59.237 --> 01:02.755
But Colonel O'Neill and Captain Carter
are due in Washington.

01:02.756 --> 01:06.075
I can hardly ask the US President
to change his schedule.

01:06.075 --> 01:09.316
If I don't go back now,
they will bury the gate for good.

01:09.317 --> 01:11.356
I told them to if I never came back.

01:13.194 --> 01:16.474
General, I lived among
these people for over a year.

01:16.474 --> 01:19.634
And I couldn't possibly
be safer than with Teal'c.

01:19.635 --> 01:22.471
- Thank you, Daniel Jackson.
- You're welcome.

01:22.472 --> 01:25.474
Daniel Jackson assures me
they are a peaceful people.

01:25.474 --> 01:28.049
They're a great people! Are you kiddin'?

01:29.073 --> 01:34.152
In fact, why don't we blow off this medal
ceremony thing and go with the boys?

01:35.513 --> 01:37.552
You may leave when ready.

01:51.790 --> 01:54.870
So we'll come pick you up
in a couple of days, huh?

01:54.871 --> 01:57.243
And... say hi to the President for me.

01:57.271 --> 01:59.311
Will do.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.715
Don't be afraid, good father.

02:24.548 --> 02:26.588
This is Teal'c.

02:26.627 --> 02:29.414
<i>Tal mal tiak, mal we-ia.</i>

02:30.747 --> 02:32.788
I am honoured.

02:34.706 --> 02:37.543
<i>Bai ah kawk ma tee.</i>

02:44.985 --> 02:49.424
Good father, I ask your forgiveness.
I have returned without your daughter.

02:49.425 --> 02:51.796
So it is.

02:52.824 --> 02:56.324
I fear that my search
will continue for many seasons.

02:58.424 --> 03:00.049
Come.

03:21.860 --> 03:23.901
Sha're!

04:39.093 --> 04:41.466
No! Take my life in exchange.

04:42.413 --> 04:44.454
Nobody's killing anybody.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.617
Sha're is no longer your daughter.

04:46.653 --> 04:48.396
Kasuf, we're in danger.

04:48.451 --> 04:51.204
- How long has she been here?
- More than a season.

04:51.213 --> 04:53.252
- What?
- Why are we in danger?

04:53.292 --> 04:54.668
Husband.

04:54.731 --> 04:57.651
I am Sha're's husband. Who are you?

04:57.653 --> 05:01.810
- My Daniel, please!
- Come no further.

05:01.812 --> 05:05.170
Good son! Do your eyes not see?

05:05.170 --> 05:08.208
Sha're has been taken by a Goa'uld.

05:08.211 --> 05:11.247
A demon now lives within her.
One of great power and evil.

05:12.769 --> 05:14.810
He speaks the truth, Father.

05:14.850 --> 05:18.127
- But you said you returned to me!
- And I have.

05:18.129 --> 05:19.872
Stop it! Just stop it!

05:19.930 --> 05:23.329
You can't fool me! I know what you are!
I've seen what you are!

05:23.329 --> 05:25.158
Please, believe me!

05:25.209 --> 05:26.834
No.

05:26.889 --> 05:30.389
The demon sleeps
because I am with child.

05:34.966 --> 05:37.007
Hear me, husband!

05:37.887 --> 05:41.646
The Goa'uld that has stolen
my soul is called Amaunet.

05:41.646 --> 05:45.206
She sleeps for the sake of the child.

05:45.206 --> 05:46.322
Why?

05:46.408 --> 05:50.108
If she awakens, the child
will come forth stillborn.

05:51.567 --> 05:54.733
I have never known a Goa'uld
to father a human child.

05:57.406 --> 05:59.446
Apophis is the father?

06:02.764 --> 06:06.514
- Yes.
- Then Apophis is here also.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.324
No.

06:09.363 --> 06:11.404
He has hidden me away.

06:11.444 --> 06:17.122
He does not want to reveal the true
purpose of this child to his enemies.

06:17.122 --> 06:19.199
What true purpose?

06:22.043 --> 06:24.082
Sha're!

06:24.124 --> 06:27.290
What does Apophis want
with a human child?

06:28.684 --> 06:33.262
He wishes the child
to one day become his new host.

06:37.161 --> 06:38.572
Is that true?

06:42.841 --> 06:44.038
Sha're!

06:48.322 --> 06:50.029
Is that true?

06:53.279 --> 06:55.319
Yes.

07:33.675 --> 07:37.435
<i>You know, I can navigate
my way across a galaxy.</i>

07:37.435 --> 07:40.223
But I get lost every time
I come to Washington.

07:40.235 --> 07:43.393
Don't worry, sir.
These are my old stomping grounds.

07:43.394 --> 07:45.351
Sorry to hear that.

07:45.394 --> 07:49.273
Two years at the Pentagon
trying to make the Stargate a reality.

07:49.274 --> 07:52.192
- I'd say it was time well spent.
- You think?

08:07.153 --> 08:10.271
- General Hammond's doing the rounds.
- Oh, yeah.

08:10.271 --> 08:13.269
He's a player. He knows
how to work a room.

08:13.271 --> 08:15.644
- Punch?
- Yes, sir. Thanks.

08:26.391 --> 08:28.848
Dad.

08:34.831 --> 08:36.870
Daniel no longer loves me.

08:38.789 --> 08:40.830
You are incorrect.

08:43.308 --> 08:45.979
Daniel Jackson cares for you greatly.

08:45.988 --> 08:48.443
He does not behave as a husband.

08:49.668 --> 08:52.076
I have seen your face before.

08:52.107 --> 08:54.943
As first prime of Apophis,...

08:54.947 --> 08:58.232
...I was present when
the Goa'uld invaded your body.

08:59.346 --> 09:02.217
For my part, I can only
ask your forgiveness.

09:02.226 --> 09:04.801
No. It is more.

09:05.506 --> 09:07.962
You are the traitor.

09:08.306 --> 09:09.716
Teal'c.

09:11.225 --> 09:12.635
That is correct.

09:12.706 --> 09:14.830
How can you know this?

09:19.945 --> 09:22.068
My mind is full of images.

09:22.104 --> 09:25.687
Apophis railing and cursing your name.

09:26.624 --> 09:29.115
His place among the System Lords
is no more.

09:29.144 --> 09:32.423
Then these are the memories
of the Goa'uld within you.

09:32.423 --> 09:34.463
Yes.

09:54.542 --> 09:56.581
This is most difficult.

09:59.820 --> 10:01.860
Daniel Jackson,...

10:01.900 --> 10:05.851
...we must return with Sha're
through the Stargate immediately.

10:07.379 --> 10:09.039
Why?

10:09.099 --> 10:13.048
As long as the Goa'uld within her sleeps,
Sha're shares its memories.

10:13.860 --> 10:15.899
So? So what?

10:15.940 --> 10:18.395
It would be of great strategic benefit...

10:18.418 --> 10:22.697
...to have access to the Goa'uld
genetic memory, even for a few days.

10:22.698 --> 10:24.739
What?!

10:27.177 --> 10:29.219
Access?

10:30.298 --> 10:33.296
Do you know who it is
we're talking about?

10:33.297 --> 10:35.336
I do.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.623
And soon she will give birth.

10:39.696 --> 10:42.153
Well, hasn't she gone through enough?

10:43.096 --> 10:47.894
What are you talking about here, Teal'c?
Handing her over to Maybourne for study?

10:47.895 --> 10:50.975
The knowledge she possesses
could one day save your world.

10:50.975 --> 10:53.015
I don't care!

10:54.934 --> 10:57.807
I will not put her through that, too!

10:58.695 --> 11:00.735
I'm sorry!

11:02.134 --> 11:05.893
More sorry for yourself,
it appears, than for Sha're.

11:05.894 --> 11:09.493
Within a matter of days,
Sha're will give birth.

11:09.494 --> 11:11.985
The Goa'uld within her will be awakened.

11:12.013 --> 11:15.373
Apophis will take this child
and leave Abydos for ever.

11:15.374 --> 11:19.418
That is the fate you choose for Sha're
by allowing her to stay.

11:31.971 --> 11:34.178
Then I'd like a moment with my wife.

11:36.370 --> 11:38.863
Alone.

11:49.169 --> 11:53.248
I invited Jake myself, Captain.
I thought you might enjoy the surprise.

11:53.249 --> 11:55.373
Really, sir, that's sweet.

11:55.408 --> 11:58.687
George and I served together
when the Air Force really was...

11:58.688 --> 12:01.359
- ...our first line of defence.
- It still is.

12:01.368 --> 12:05.086
Of course it is. I was talking about
when the Cold War was still on.

12:05.087 --> 12:09.880
Anyway, when George told me you were
up for the air medal for your work in...

12:10.846 --> 12:13.552
What the hell was that again?

12:14.687 --> 12:17.773
Analysis of deep-space radar telemetry.

12:18.166 --> 12:19.661
Right!

12:23.245 --> 12:25.286
- Sam...
- Thank you, sir.

12:25.326 --> 12:27.650
Colonel Jack O'Neill - Jacob Carter.

12:28.445 --> 12:30.437
Carter? As in...?

12:30.485 --> 12:32.395
As in... my father, sir, yes.

12:32.446 --> 12:34.735
Get outta town! Sam's dad?

12:35.724 --> 12:38.923
- I've heard nothing about you, sir.
- What's there to say...

12:38.924 --> 12:41.380
...about an old general waiting to retire?

12:41.404 --> 12:45.123
- Dad, I talk about you all the time.
- I retired myself one time.

12:45.124 --> 12:46.915
Couldn't stay away.

12:46.963 --> 12:52.001
From your analysis of deep-space
radar telemetry, you mean.

12:52.003 --> 12:55.763
Well, it's just so damn fascinating.

12:55.764 --> 13:00.000
I'm sure it is. Otherwise,
you wouldn't be receiving the air medal.

13:00.001 --> 13:02.291
We have our moments.

13:04.403 --> 13:06.442
Uh... Will you excuse me?

13:06.480 --> 13:11.558
We don't get out of Cheyenne Mountain
enough. I'm gonna grab some air, outside.

13:12.402 --> 13:15.558
General... Captain... General... Waiter?

13:15.559 --> 13:17.600
I guess I'll go make the rounds.

13:20.520 --> 13:22.145
Just between us,...

13:22.201 --> 13:25.036
...your cover stories
could use a little polish.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.791
Sorry, Dad? I don't know what you mean.

13:27.799 --> 13:29.958
Of course not. I'm out of line.

13:31.639 --> 13:35.798
But whatever it is you really analyse
in that mountain, deep space or not,...

13:35.798 --> 13:38.254
...it can't be as exciting as the real thing.

13:39.357 --> 13:42.609
I'm talking about
getting you into NASA, Sam.

13:43.479 --> 13:46.979
I'm talking about you actually
going to space some day.

14:16.515 --> 14:18.009
You hate me.

14:18.076 --> 14:19.903
No.

14:19.955 --> 14:22.197
No, I love you.

14:22.232 --> 14:24.523
Will you forgive me?

14:24.553 --> 14:26.594
Oh, God.

14:33.472 --> 14:35.514
There's nothing to forgive.

14:40.471 --> 14:42.511
I am so ashamed.

14:47.951 --> 14:50.193
I hate what's been done to you.

14:51.870 --> 14:55.786
I hate what Apophis plans
for the child growing inside of you.

14:59.950 --> 15:01.990
Look at me.

15:08.469 --> 15:10.094
I love you.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.588
Everything else...

15:23.187 --> 15:25.644
- I love you.
- Oh!

15:34.226 --> 15:36.682
Will you stay?

15:36.706 --> 15:38.746
I can't.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.601
Because I want you
to come home with me.

15:59.383 --> 16:02.052
I made a call to Bollinger himself.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.104
- Head of NASA.
- I know.

16:04.144 --> 16:08.101
I told him you'd always wanted
to be an astronaut but gave up...

16:08.102 --> 16:10.143
- I didn't give up!
- Let me finish.

16:10.182 --> 16:14.301
You gave up waiting for the programme
to resume after the Challenger disaster.

16:14.302 --> 16:18.100
- It was bad timing.
- Yes, well, I called in a few markers.

16:18.101 --> 16:20.972
I filled him in on your qualifications.

16:20.981 --> 16:24.780
You apply again,
as an Air Force nominee, young lady,...

16:24.782 --> 16:27.533
...and I think you'll find NASA supportive.

16:27.541 --> 16:30.708
- There's a waiting list a mile long.
- Not for you.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.624
- Dad, you can't do that.
- I did.

16:33.661 --> 16:35.286
Without talking to me first.

16:36.301 --> 16:38.756
You're... telling me you don't want this?

16:40.338 --> 16:44.179
They know what you can offer
the space programme. They want you.

16:44.181 --> 16:48.258
That's not the point. The work
I am doing now is very important to me.

16:48.259 --> 16:49.884
It's not your dream.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.821
Let's just leave it at that. Please?

16:53.499 --> 16:55.538
At least talk to the man.

16:55.577 --> 16:57.618
Do that much for me.

16:59.258 --> 17:02.176
<i>I knew sooner or later
you'd make this about you.</i>

17:02.898 --> 17:05.976
- All right.
- It's not that I don't appreciate it.

17:05.977 --> 17:07.519
I said all right!

17:07.576 --> 17:10.247
I'll catch up with you after the ceremony.

17:22.376 --> 17:24.415
Colonel Jack O'Neill, right?

17:26.733 --> 17:28.775
I'm not sure.

17:30.574 --> 17:33.326
You are one hard man to find,
let me tell you.

17:35.335 --> 17:38.772
- Who are you?
- Armin Selig.

17:38.773 --> 17:40.518
I'm a journalist.

17:40.573 --> 17:43.242
I'll have a beer.

17:44.893 --> 17:46.932
Why don't you have mine?

17:46.973 --> 17:48.967
I haven't touched it.

17:49.012 --> 17:53.392
- Heading back to the Stargate so soon?
- The what?

17:54.290 --> 17:56.913
Big, round, greyish thing. Can't miss it.

17:56.932 --> 17:59.221
I don't know what that is.

17:59.251 --> 18:02.529
Before you go, Colonel,
maybe you should hear this.

18:02.530 --> 18:05.970
I knew you were coming here,
so I planned ahead, and...

18:05.971 --> 18:08.010
...I got a little lucky.

18:08.049 --> 18:11.411
<i>You know,
I can navigate my way across a galaxy.</i>

18:11.412 --> 18:14.200
<i>But I get lost every time
I come to Washington.</i>

18:14.211 --> 18:17.768
<i>Don't worry, sir.
These are my old stomping grounds.</i>

18:17.769 --> 18:19.311
<i>My condolences.</i>

18:19.368 --> 18:22.809
<i>Two years at the Pentagon
trying to make Stargate a reality.</i>

18:22.810 --> 18:25.765
<i>- I'd say it was time well spent.
- You think?</i>

18:25.769 --> 18:28.343
This isn't all I've got to go on, mind you.

18:28.368 --> 18:31.287
I have a source who told me
about a device...

18:31.288 --> 18:34.846
...that can send people halfway
across the galaxy and back again.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.635
Just looking for a little confirmation.

18:39.968 --> 18:43.052
Parabolic microphone,
across the square, maybe?

18:44.047 --> 18:46.086
Something like that.

18:47.008 --> 18:49.048
Technology, huh?

18:49.086 --> 18:51.661
Listen, I don't know who your source is,...

18:51.686 --> 18:53.929
...but I'm a colonel in the US Air Force.

18:53.965 --> 18:57.924
A C-5 Galaxy is a transport aircraft,
one of the largest in the world.

18:57.925 --> 18:59.965
That's what I was referring to.

19:00.007 --> 19:01.336
And the Stargate?

19:02.765 --> 19:04.805
You got me on that one.

19:13.203 --> 19:16.482
After the child is born,
the demon within me will awaken again.

19:16.483 --> 19:19.520
She will punish the child
for my disobedience.

19:19.523 --> 19:23.721
We will not allow it. The Goa'uld
will have become our prisoner.

19:23.722 --> 19:26.642
We'll have time together
until the child is born.

19:26.643 --> 19:29.642
You will be asked
what you remember of the Goa'uld.

19:29.643 --> 19:33.121
But I will be there the whole time.
I won't let them hurt you.

19:33.122 --> 19:35.577
We can study what keeps
the Goa'uld dormant.

19:35.602 --> 19:38.009
There may even be a way
we can remain together.

19:38.042 --> 19:40.083
Apophis will return.

19:40.121 --> 19:43.240
If she is gone,
he will destroy the whole village.

19:43.240 --> 19:47.960
Tell them an enemy of Apophis came
and stole Sha're and the child away.

19:47.961 --> 19:49.669
And it will be the truth, yes?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.577
Go with them.

19:53.640 --> 19:56.510
You can't just... tell her like that.

19:56.519 --> 19:58.393
I'm her father.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.584
Sha're...

20:01.640 --> 20:03.467
I won't force you.

20:05.838 --> 20:09.125
Once the demon returns,
will I be with you then?

20:10.077 --> 20:14.396
No. Until we could find a way to
remove the Goa'uld from within you,...

20:14.397 --> 20:18.146
...they would lock you up in a cell.
That's something like a cage.

20:19.037 --> 20:21.955
So the Goa'uld within you
will not harm others.

20:23.117 --> 20:26.555
<i>Look, I won't pretend
this is going to be easy.</i>

20:26.556 --> 20:31.800
But this way Apophis will not be allowed
to hurt you or your child ever again.

20:35.316 --> 20:37.689
Then I will come with you, my Daniel.

20:41.795 --> 20:45.594
Apophis may return at any moment.
We must leave now.

20:45.595 --> 20:48.953
He's got a great hand speed,
and he can really snap the jet.

20:48.954 --> 20:52.592
So he got in three good ones,
then feigned it with his right,...

20:52.593 --> 20:55.262
...came in with a left hook
and a right cross...

20:55.273 --> 20:57.682
General? A moment, please?

20:57.712 --> 20:59.540
Excuse me.

21:00.272 --> 21:02.313
We've got a problem, sir.

21:02.354 --> 21:04.394
We've sprung a leak.

21:04.432 --> 21:09.431
Apparently, someone with knowledge
of the programme... talked to a reporter.

21:09.432 --> 21:12.102
- This reporter approached you?
- Yes, sir.

21:12.112 --> 21:14.948
- And you said...?
- I denied everything.

21:14.951 --> 21:18.431
- He didn't buy it.
- How much does he know?

21:18.432 --> 21:23.028
Well, if he knows me and knew
how to find me here, a lot.

21:23.029 --> 21:25.984
Then you're right. We've got a problem.

21:31.710 --> 21:33.750
Daniel, can you hear it?

21:33.788 --> 21:35.828
Hear what? What's wrong?

21:43.868 --> 21:46.325
<i>Ben ma wa...</i>

21:46.347 --> 21:48.590
<i>The Goa'uld ship approaches.</i>

21:54.866 --> 21:56.491
Sha're, what's wrong?

21:58.586 --> 22:00.710
<i>My lord comes for me.</i>

22:02.227 --> 22:03.685
No!

22:03.747 --> 22:05.740
Sha're, fight this thing.

22:05.787 --> 22:08.278
You have to hold on
a little longer - please!

22:10.224 --> 22:11.636
Daniel?

22:14.026 --> 22:16.066
It's OK. It's gone now.

22:16.105 --> 22:18.347
Daniel! Daniel!

22:18.384 --> 22:21.864
Teal'c! I think she just went into labour!

22:21.865 --> 22:24.535
The Goa'uld's return may have induced it!

22:25.585 --> 22:27.460
<i>Daniel!</i>

22:32.223 --> 22:35.427
Daniel Jackson! We must leave now!

22:56.182 --> 22:59.858
My lord, someone attempted
to flee through the Stargate.

22:59.859 --> 23:01.854
They did not have time to escape.

23:01.901 --> 23:03.858
<i>Find Apophis's queen.</i>

23:10.339 --> 23:13.009
Say he runs his story.
How bad could it get?

23:13.019 --> 23:17.898
Bad. Half the government would want to
bury it, the rest would want a piece of it.

23:17.900 --> 23:20.438
Add to that the international fallout...

23:20.460 --> 23:23.457
...once Russia and China hear
we kept it from them.

23:23.458 --> 23:27.017
Proof of aliens, worlds populated
by ancient human cultures.

23:27.018 --> 23:29.057
I don't see the problem.

23:29.098 --> 23:32.336
I can't help but wonder
who the source could be.

23:32.337 --> 23:36.176
- Any one of hundreds of people.
- It's hard to believe it's one of ours.

23:36.177 --> 23:39.296
Every member of the SGC
knows how important our work is.

23:39.297 --> 23:42.736
I agree with Captain Carter.
It's much more likely political.

23:42.737 --> 23:46.455
<i>- Senator Kinsey?
- If he knows, so do a dozen sycophants.</i>

23:46.457 --> 23:52.375
Civilians sign non-disclosure statements.
Technically they're liable to prosecution.

23:52.375 --> 23:54.867
So what do we do - sue 'em?

23:54.894 --> 23:58.134
There's still some time
before the ceremony, Colonel.

23:58.134 --> 24:00.174
I'd like to know how much he knows.

24:00.213 --> 24:02.253
Do you know how to find him?

24:03.055 --> 24:05.547
I'll let him find me, sir.

24:08.334 --> 24:10.789
When the pain comes,
you have to breathe.

24:10.813 --> 24:13.352
- It comes too soon.
- The baby will be fine.

24:13.373 --> 24:15.413
Just worry about yourself.

24:15.453 --> 24:18.409
When the child comes forth,
the demon will return!

24:18.413 --> 24:20.951
- I know.
- Apophis comes for me!

24:20.972 --> 24:23.595
It was not the ship of Apophis.

24:26.332 --> 24:28.372
Then who?

24:28.412 --> 24:30.239
It was that of Heru-ur.

24:31.652 --> 24:33.692
He is a great enemy of Apophis.

24:33.731 --> 24:35.771
He will take my child.

24:35.810 --> 24:38.480
- Ah, Daniel!
- It's OK. Breathe! Breathe.

24:38.490 --> 24:40.816
This is where we hid from Ra, remember?

24:40.851 --> 24:42.891
- Remember?
- I remember.

24:42.932 --> 24:44.759
We're safe here.

24:44.809 --> 24:47.099
You are incorrect, Daniel Jackson.

24:47.128 --> 24:50.329
If it is Sha're that Heru-ur seeks,
he will find us.

24:50.330 --> 24:52.204
We cannot remain.

24:53.048 --> 24:55.088
Well, I am not leaving her.

24:56.368 --> 25:00.248
The moment the child is born,
the Goa'uld within Sha're will re-emerge.

25:00.249 --> 25:03.500
I said I am not leaving her, Teal'c!

25:07.847 --> 25:11.681
Then I will do what I can
to keep the Horus Guard away from you.

25:22.247 --> 25:24.287
You do love me.

25:25.526 --> 25:27.768
Yes, I do.

26:01.561 --> 26:03.602
Looking for me?

26:03.642 --> 26:08.104
Find out what the reporter knows while
your people check on his credentials?

26:08.961 --> 26:11.001
Ah, that's a clichÃ©, Armin.

26:11.041 --> 26:14.719
I'm very good at this, Colonel.
I've been doing it a while.

26:14.720 --> 26:18.161
This'll be the biggest story
I've ever broken, but then...

26:18.162 --> 26:21.199
...it's the biggest story
anyone's broken, isn't it?

26:21.201 --> 26:22.909
Tell me.

26:24.239 --> 26:28.118
I've got all I need. I don't need you.
But I wanted to meet you anyway.

26:28.119 --> 26:30.528
When this breaks, you're gonna be a hero.

26:31.959 --> 26:33.999
Cool.

26:34.038 --> 26:37.557
- What are you gonna say about me?
- Subtle!

26:37.558 --> 26:39.599
OK, I'll do you a favour.

26:41.077 --> 26:43.913
You're the team leader
of a unit called SG-1.

26:43.919 --> 26:48.875
Between nine and 12 such units operate
out of Cheyenne Mountain under NORAD.

26:48.876 --> 26:53.421
You use a device called a Stargate
to travel light years from here.

26:56.715 --> 26:58.126
Wow!

26:58.195 --> 27:00.236
That's pretty amazing.

27:03.634 --> 27:06.008
The programme costs over seven billion.

27:06.035 --> 27:10.275
But the Defense Department hopes
new technologies will offset expenditure.

27:10.276 --> 27:13.811
<i>Armin, let me do you a favour.</i>

27:14.634 --> 27:18.434
You don't know anything.
Don't embarrass yourself.

27:18.435 --> 27:22.352
I know those two brilliant flashes
in the night sky a few months ago...

27:22.353 --> 27:25.432
...were really alien ships
on their way to attack Earth.

27:25.433 --> 27:27.473
<i>- You blew them up.
- I did?</i>

27:28.472 --> 27:30.512
<i>All right.</i>

27:31.471 --> 27:33.761
If you're gonna go ahead with it,...

27:33.792 --> 27:36.545
...I wanna make sure
you get one thing right.

27:38.031 --> 27:40.605
It's O'Neill, with two Is.

27:42.673 --> 27:47.390
There's another Colonel O'Neil with one I.
He has no sense of humour at all.

27:47.391 --> 27:52.309
- The story's gonna run, Colonel.
- It'll read like science fiction, Armin.

27:52.310 --> 27:55.909
- This country has no official secrets act.
- I know that.

27:55.910 --> 27:58.282
- You can't stop me.
- I know that, too.

27:58.311 --> 28:03.982
- You don't think anyone'll believe it?
- I'm sure someone will. But it's not me.

28:05.630 --> 28:07.670
We'll see.

28:12.468 --> 28:14.508
That's two Is, right?

28:24.948 --> 28:26.988
You! 911- ambulance! Now!

28:27.826 --> 28:30.153
Don't move! Don't try to move!

28:30.186 --> 28:32.310
<i>You did this.</i>

28:32.346 --> 28:34.386
No! No, we didn't do this.

28:36.105 --> 28:38.145
Son of a bitch.

28:56.306 --> 28:57.765
My lord!

28:57.825 --> 29:00.031
I have questioned many in the city.

29:00.063 --> 29:02.898
Apophis's queen is here,
as you suspected.

29:02.903 --> 29:06.622
Apophis will return through the Stargate
to claim his child.

29:06.623 --> 29:11.250
- We shall be here, my lord.
- His queen and child will be taken alive.

29:15.301 --> 29:17.758
Where is your daughter?

29:17.781 --> 29:21.067
I cannot tell you what I do not know.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.540
What? Would you have me lie?

29:29.300 --> 29:30.843
<i>Jaffa!</i>

29:38.700 --> 29:40.740
Dad?

29:40.778 --> 29:43.020
I've been looking all over for you.

29:43.059 --> 29:46.978
You must be disappointed.
Any idea why the President cancelled?

29:46.979 --> 29:49.352
Colonel O'Neill witnessed an accident.

29:49.378 --> 29:53.458
The President couldn't adjust
his schedule. Bad timing all around.

29:53.459 --> 29:58.096
General Hammond will give us the medals
at a private ceremony back at the base.

29:58.096 --> 30:01.977
Well, it's the honour that matters.
Whether I can be there or not.

30:01.978 --> 30:04.184
- Dad...
- I have cancer, Sam.

30:05.856 --> 30:08.431
- What?
- Lymphoma.

30:10.416 --> 30:12.954
- That's bad.
- Well, it's not good.

30:12.977 --> 30:17.215
But it's not the worst. Don't you worry.
I'm gonna be around for a while.

30:17.217 --> 30:19.257
Oh, God... Dad!

30:26.535 --> 30:29.619
I was hoping to live to see you
become an astronaut.

30:30.614 --> 30:34.174
Sweetheart, I don't care
what it is you do in that mountain.

30:34.175 --> 30:38.051
Nothing in the world can live up to
the chance of going to space.

30:38.052 --> 30:40.093
Not for you.

30:40.134 --> 30:43.253
It's something you've wanted
your whole life.

30:44.173 --> 30:49.049
And, I admit it, I want to see you
fulfil your life's dreams before I die.

30:49.814 --> 30:52.019
<i>But it's my dream. Isn't it up to me?</i>

30:52.052 --> 30:54.046
Fathers have dreams, too.

30:56.931 --> 30:58.971
I'm sorry, I can't.

31:01.612 --> 31:03.022
All right.

31:05.852 --> 31:08.929
Like I said, this thing's
gonna go on for months.

31:08.930 --> 31:11.682
So you don't have to
check up on me tomorrow.

31:11.692 --> 31:13.601
Dad, please don't go like this.

31:13.652 --> 31:15.692
Congratulations on the medal.

31:15.730 --> 31:17.769
I'm sure you deserve it.

31:19.048 --> 31:21.587
Dad...

31:31.409 --> 31:32.951
Daniel!

31:33.008 --> 31:36.887
- It's all right, Sha're. Push!
- No! The demon will come back!

31:36.888 --> 31:38.929
You have to push!

31:38.968 --> 31:42.046
- But I will lose you, Daniel! Please!
- Look at me.

31:42.047 --> 31:44.919
- Agh! Please!
- Look at me!

31:44.926 --> 31:48.246
I love you. I will always love you.
You understand?

31:48.247 --> 31:51.444
The Goa'uld can never
take that away from us.

31:51.445 --> 31:53.355
Never.

31:53.405 --> 31:56.990
- Agh, Daniel! The pain comes again!
- I'm here.

31:58.326 --> 32:00.567
Aaagh! Daniel!

32:00.606 --> 32:02.267
I'm here!

32:02.326 --> 32:04.996
And now the baby's here!
Now you have to push!

32:09.644 --> 32:11.684
<i>Forgive me.</i>

32:17.364 --> 32:19.605
It's a boy!

32:21.323 --> 32:23.446
It's a boy.

32:24.083 --> 32:26.123
<i>Give me the child!</i>

32:34.561 --> 32:36.769
Bring me the child of Apophis.

32:51.361 --> 32:55.638
<i>Apophis, my pharaoh,
will destroy you both for this.</i>

32:55.640 --> 32:58.309
Tell him Heru-ur
has taken his son as his own.

33:07.478 --> 33:09.518
We have little time.

33:16.917 --> 33:18.958
We must go.

33:29.236 --> 33:31.276
It's your grandson.

33:35.476 --> 33:37.932
He is beautiful. Yes?

33:37.957 --> 33:39.997
Yes, he is.

33:41.275 --> 33:45.152
You cannot remain here, good father.
You must go into hiding.

33:45.153 --> 33:49.114
You are telling me the demon
has returned to reclaim my daughter?

33:49.115 --> 33:50.656
Yes.

33:52.833 --> 33:54.910
I will need a nursing woman.

33:54.953 --> 33:59.165
You must find one whom you can trust,
one who is not afraid of hardship.

34:03.553 --> 34:06.637
So it may be that I will never
see my daughter again.

34:07.553 --> 34:10.911
Sha're is strong, good father.
She will not give up.

34:10.911 --> 34:13.237
And neither will I.

34:24.349 --> 34:28.150
Colonel Jack O'Neill,
Captain Samantha Carter.

34:28.150 --> 34:33.989
You have distinguished yourselves by
heroism involving voluntary risk of life.

34:35.349 --> 34:37.592
Against impossible odds,...

34:37.630 --> 34:43.427
...with only the help of your team members
Teal'c and Dr. Daniel Jackson,...

34:43.429 --> 34:48.186
...you destroyed both Goa'uld spacecraft
that were poised to attack this world.

34:48.188 --> 34:51.746
Your exemplary courage and heroism
reflect great credit...

34:51.748 --> 34:54.998
...upon yourself
and the United States Air Force.

34:56.387 --> 34:57.798
Thank you, sir.

34:58.947 --> 35:01.945
I'm only sorry the accident
made it impossible...

35:01.947 --> 35:04.190
...for the President himself to do this.

35:04.226 --> 35:08.177
I beg to differ, sir.
It's an honour to receive it from you.

35:09.146 --> 35:11.186
Congratulations, Captain.

35:11.224 --> 35:13.931
I know Dr. Jackson
is expecting you on Abydos.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.985
You may ship out when ready.

35:16.025 --> 35:18.648
I'll be ready to go in ten minutes, Colonel.

35:21.824 --> 35:23.449
Dismissed.

35:35.784 --> 35:38.570
<i>It was an accident.</i>

35:40.943 --> 35:42.983
Yes, sir.

35:53.382 --> 35:55.208
<i>My lord.</i>

35:56.581 --> 35:58.621
<i>Kel shak, Jaffa?</i>

35:58.661 --> 36:00.701
<i>Kel shak, Heru-ur.</i>

36:01.501 --> 36:05.001
<i>Serpent guards of Apophis
have taken the child.</i>

36:05.860 --> 36:07.853
Who is this human?

36:07.900 --> 36:11.418
He claims his people are the Tauri,
enemies of Apophis.

36:11.418 --> 36:15.418
You? Among the warriors
who defeated Apophis?

36:15.420 --> 36:17.164
As a matter of fact, I was.

36:20.018 --> 36:22.260
The Tauri are stronger than you think.

36:22.297 --> 36:26.842
An alliance would prove extremely useful
to both of us, against our common enemy.

36:27.778 --> 36:29.818
Alliance?

36:30.697 --> 36:32.737
You are nothing.

36:32.777 --> 36:34.985
Your world is nothing.

36:35.018 --> 36:39.096
Once I have conquered Apophis,
I will make slaves of your people.

36:39.097 --> 36:41.137
<i>You will serve me.</i>

36:43.018 --> 36:45.224
No, I don't think so.

36:47.135 --> 36:49.710
Kneel before your God!

36:57.775 --> 36:59.934
My lord, the Stargate!

37:03.894 --> 37:05.934
Apophis comes! Stand ready!

37:34.052 --> 37:35.844
Tauri! Kree!

37:35.891 --> 37:37.931
What the hell...?

37:42.891 --> 37:44.007
Cover me!

37:55.248 --> 37:57.289
You dare challenge me?

38:00.648 --> 38:02.190
I was thinkin' about it.

38:08.407 --> 38:10.447
You'll pay for this insolence!

38:27.085 --> 38:30.806
<i>- Teal'c?
- Somebody explain what just happened.</i>

38:30.806 --> 38:34.324
- It is a lengthy tale, O'Neill.
- "Long story", Teal'c.

38:34.324 --> 38:37.563
Good thing you remembered
their shield's deflection...

38:37.563 --> 38:41.324
...is directly proportionaI
to the kinetic energy directed at it.

38:41.326 --> 38:42.985
Right!

38:43.045 --> 38:44.835
We should get out of here.

38:46.043 --> 38:48.083
- Apophis.
- What?!

38:48.123 --> 38:50.164
We must cover ourselves.

39:12.161 --> 39:14.451
<i>Jaffa. Kel Amaunet.</i>

39:14.481 --> 39:16.438
I am here, my Pharaoh.

39:31.400 --> 39:33.440
The child?

39:35.318 --> 39:37.858
Stolen, by your enemy Heru-ur.

39:39.039 --> 39:41.791
Forgive me, my Pharaoh, for failing you.

39:51.356 --> 39:53.018
<i>Jaffa! Shal tek!</i>

40:09.996 --> 40:12.914
Come home with me, my queen.

40:28.592 --> 40:31.512
Sir, there's still
a Goa'uld ship on top of us.

40:31.512 --> 40:33.552
Dial us home, Captain, please.

40:39.032 --> 40:41.487
Are you all right?

40:41.512 --> 40:43.552
No. No, I'm not.

40:45.431 --> 40:47.471
But I will be.

40:49.391 --> 40:52.144
She looked directly at us, Daniel Jackson.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.440
But she did not reveal our position.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.789
Let's go home.

41:02.840 --> 41:07.389
