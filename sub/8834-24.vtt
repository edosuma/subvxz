[flies buzzing]

01:14.083 --> 01:16.709
Hi.
This Higher for Hire?

01:16.792 --> 01:18.917
No. Go away.

01:19.291 --> 01:20.291
[grunts]

01:20.375 --> 01:21.667
But I heard you ship stuff,

01:21.750 --> 01:24.375
and I got this fine load
of grade-A fertilizer.

01:24.458 --> 01:27.834
Phew. Sorry, we're a high-class operation,

01:27.917 --> 01:31.166
and I'm expecting important people,
so goodbye.

01:31.250 --> 01:34.667
Well!
I'm taking my business elsewhere.

01:34.750 --> 01:37.333
And take your pungent package with you.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.458
[groans]
Peasant.

01:39.542 --> 01:42.375
What's the idea of insultin' poor Fred?

01:42.458 --> 01:46.417
Oh, so, you sent that awful man here.
Now, why doesn't that surprise me?

01:46.500 --> 01:50.041
You don't make money
by shooin' customers away.

01:50.125 --> 01:52.917
Customer?
He looked more like a bum.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.542
Rebecca, don't judge
a bank book by its cover.

01:56.625 --> 02:00.083
That bum is worth
a half a million shaboozies.

02:00.166 --> 02:03.750
Him?
Now who's full of fertilizer?

02:03.834 --> 02:07.750
The problem with you, Becky,
is you're too hung up on appearances.

02:07.834 --> 02:09.083
You oughta...

02:09.166 --> 02:12.041
Hey, who's this?
Your gym teacher?

02:12.125 --> 02:14.500
What happened to my picture of Louie?

02:14.583 --> 02:18.417
I was tired of looking at
that crude pile of matted fur.

02:18.500 --> 02:23.542
-Hey, that matted fur is my friend.
-He's a slob.

02:23.625 --> 02:25.834
And I don't like slobs around me.

02:26.709 --> 02:29.792
From now on we're going after
a fancier class of clientèle.

02:29.875 --> 02:34.291
All right, and how're you gonna get
rich folks to hire us?

02:34.375 --> 02:35.625
Look at this ad.

02:35.709 --> 02:39.709
"Fly the affluent skies
with Higher for Hire."

02:40.959 --> 02:44.625
Wait a minute.
How much did that richie magazine ad cost?

02:45.250 --> 02:47.834
You have to spend money to make money.

02:49.709 --> 02:51.709
Ow! Ooh.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
If you must know, 500.

02:55.083 --> 02:59.000
What?
Now, where did you get that kinda dough?

02:59.083 --> 03:01.417
Just relax. We're gonna be rich soon.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.792
-[knocking on door]
-Take your manure and go away!

03:04.458 --> 03:09.583
Ooh, frightfully sorry,
but I don't have any... manure.

03:09.667 --> 03:14.458
Did I say manure?
I meant <i>bonjour.</i>

03:15.875 --> 03:16.750
Do come in.

03:16.834 --> 03:19.792
[laughs]
How wonderful.

03:19.875 --> 03:22.834
Oh, let me introduce myself.
Buffy Vanderschmeer.

03:22.917 --> 03:24.291
Buffy?

03:24.375 --> 03:26.500
And my lovely wife, Muffy.

03:26.583 --> 03:29.333
Muffy and Buffy?

03:29.417 --> 03:32.458
-We saw your ad.
-Told you so.

03:32.542 --> 03:36.542
I'm Rebecca Cunningham,
the owner of Higher for Hire.

03:36.625 --> 03:39.166
Mr. and Mrs. Vanderschmeer,

03:39.250 --> 03:43.542
how can our humble operation
be of service to you?

03:43.875 --> 03:46.000
Well, we need to take
my grandmother's diamonds

03:46.083 --> 03:48.959
to the family compound at Hyenas Port.

03:49.041 --> 03:53.625
-Is this a can-do?
-I don't know. That's a toughie.

03:53.917 --> 03:58.166
-Baloo! Of course we can help you.
-Oh, fabulous.

03:58.250 --> 04:00.750
Grandmummy's jewels
are very, very valuable.

04:00.834 --> 04:05.083
-You are insured, aren't you?
-Whaddya you mean are insuranced?

04:05.166 --> 04:07.291
We're professionals, lady.

04:07.375 --> 04:10.709
Won't you help yourself?
I have to speak to my associate.

04:10.792 --> 04:14.041
-Baloo, we don't have insurance.
-Sure we do.

04:14.125 --> 04:17.000
We don't!
I cashed in the policy to buy that ad.

04:17.083 --> 04:19.500
-Now just keep quiet.
-Hey!

04:20.458 --> 04:23.542
As I was saying,
we have the latest thing in coverage,

04:23.625 --> 04:25.375
it's called collateral insurance.

04:25.458 --> 04:27.458
Really, how does it work?

04:27.542 --> 04:31.125
When we take off,
you'll get the title to <i>the Sea Duck.</i>

04:31.750 --> 04:35.834
If anything happens to your diamonds,
you keep the plane.

04:35.917 --> 04:37.792
-What?!
-How innovative.

04:37.875 --> 04:41.875
-[Baloo] No! No! You can't! Stop!
-Then it's settled.

04:41.959 --> 04:45.208
What's say we leave today, 3:30-ish?

04:45.291 --> 04:48.000
-Uh, fine-ish.
-Splendid-ish.

04:48.291 --> 04:50.542
Well, ta-ta for now.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.041
[banging]

04:53.125 --> 04:55.000
[panting]

04:55.083 --> 04:57.542
Rebecca, how could you do that?

04:57.625 --> 04:59.917
It's my plane
and if we need to take some risks

05:00.000 --> 05:01.625
to get new clients, then so be it.

05:01.709 --> 05:04.125
But... but what if something goes--

05:04.208 --> 05:06.750
Now, I'm going to change
so I'll meet you back here at 3:30.

05:06.834 --> 05:09.333
Um, could you paint the plane before then?

05:09.417 --> 05:15.250
-Are you out of your so-called mind?
-All right. Then at least wash it.

05:22.625 --> 05:25.750
Baloo, look at that shirt.
You look like a slob.

05:25.834 --> 05:27.875
I am a slob.

05:27.959 --> 05:30.709
How do you expect us
to impress Muffy and Buffy?

05:31.250 --> 05:36.000
Hey, look, I fly the plane.
It doesn't matter how I look.

05:36.083 --> 05:38.834
[Muffy] Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo!

05:39.583 --> 05:43.291
We are so looking forward
to a perfectly marvelous flight.

05:43.375 --> 05:46.542
-We'll do our best.
-Jolly good, jolly good.

05:46.625 --> 05:52.000
-Is that the jewelry?
-Well, um, uh, yes.

05:52.083 --> 05:57.625
<i>-Voilà. </i> Our inheritance.
-They're beautiful.

05:57.709 --> 06:00.917
Well, then, it's off we go into
the wild blue yonder, and all that.

06:01.000 --> 06:01.875
[chuckles]

06:01.959 --> 06:06.083
-Yep, as soon as we get our money.
-Baloo.

06:06.166 --> 06:09.208
Well, if they're so rich,
they shouldn't mind paying us.

06:09.834 --> 06:13.917
Well, of course not.
Here you go, 500 dollaries.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.625
Thank you. And here's the title
to the plane for you to hold.

06:19.208 --> 06:20.583
[Baloo groans]

06:21.375 --> 06:23.875
All right.
Everyone aboard.

06:23.959 --> 06:27.000
I hope the trip's not too roughie.

06:27.417 --> 06:31.166
Baloo, that's enoughie...
I mean, enough.

06:31.250 --> 06:32.500
Get the bags.

06:32.875 --> 06:36.333
"Get the bags."
Where does she get off... [mumbles]

06:39.917 --> 06:43.041
Ow! Hey, watch it, ya dumb ox!

06:43.125 --> 06:48.542
Ooh... I mean, I'd appreciate it
if you were more careful, young man.

06:51.917 --> 06:55.750
I'm telling ya, Becky, those two
aren't as classy as they look.

06:55.834 --> 06:58.208
<i>Au contraire, </i> dumb bear.

06:58.291 --> 07:00.750
They're rich and refined.
Educated, too.

07:01.125 --> 07:04.583
-How do you know that?
-Look at how smart their clothes are.

07:04.667 --> 07:09.041
Ow!
Smart clothes don't make smart people.

07:09.125 --> 07:12.500
Anyway, if they like us,
they'll tell their rich friends,

07:12.583 --> 07:13.875
so you be nice to them.

07:14.709 --> 07:18.417
Mind if I pop up front
for a visit with the pilot?

07:18.500 --> 07:19.375
Not at all.

07:19.709 --> 07:23.834
Simply, hi there.
Mind if I have a look-see?

07:23.917 --> 07:26.166
Well, actually, I'd rather you didn't.

07:26.250 --> 07:29.291
[chuckles]
I don't know a thing about aviation.

07:29.375 --> 07:32.041
But I've always wanted to dabble in it.

07:32.125 --> 07:36.917
-Hey, don't touch that. No, no, stop!
-[Rebecca] <i>Baloo, be nice.</i>

07:37.000 --> 07:41.917
This is so entertaining.
Could I fly just once?

07:42.458 --> 07:45.291
You know, Rebecca,
it's such a beautiful day,

07:45.375 --> 07:47.917
I just had to pop open a window.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.166
Oh, well, all right.

07:50.250 --> 07:52.208
Shut that window!

07:52.291 --> 07:55.333
I don't want to risk losing this plane
if those jewels fall out!

07:55.417 --> 07:57.667
It's all right, Baloo,
they're paying us a lot of money.

07:57.750 --> 08:02.333
But... but that blue-blooded pantywaist
wants to fly the plane.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.417
Let him.
What harm could it do?

08:04.542 --> 08:06.208
[yelling]

08:06.291 --> 08:09.166
Oh, this is amusing.

08:09.250 --> 08:12.125
Whee!
[laughing]

08:13.959 --> 08:16.458
You folks are drivin' me nuts!

08:16.542 --> 08:21.083
[Muffy] Help! My jewels
have fallen out of the plane!

08:21.166 --> 08:25.166
The jewels?
I'll lose my plane!

08:26.375 --> 08:27.875
Hands off!

08:28.166 --> 08:29.667
Oh, right, right.

08:31.542 --> 08:34.000
Come on. Where is it?

08:36.041 --> 08:38.667
Gee, I've been looking for that.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.332
Eureka!

08:46.583 --> 08:50.750
-Pull up, Baloo! Pull up!
-Not on your life, Becky.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.917
It's all or nothing.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.083
[Rebecca] Baloo!

08:56.625 --> 08:58.125
[Baloo] Bingo!

09:01.083 --> 09:04.166
Nice flying, old chap.
[grunts]

09:04.250 --> 09:06.000
Now hang on to these.

09:08.625 --> 09:13.792
I oughta fire you for talking to them
that way, but thank you, Baloo.

09:13.875 --> 09:15.667
Don't mention it, boss lady.

09:15.750 --> 09:20.458
Kind of odd though, the plane tipping
just after the window was opened.

09:20.542 --> 09:26.250
Oh, right. Muffy and Buffy
were trying to lose the jewels. [laughs]

09:26.667 --> 09:28.208
OK. Forget it.

09:28.667 --> 09:32.250
Well, strap in.
We'll be landin' at Louie's in a minute.

09:32.333 --> 09:33.500
Louie's?

09:40.834 --> 09:42.709
Fill 'er up, pal.

09:44.041 --> 09:47.375
Oh, my.
Doesn't this place look quaint?

09:47.750 --> 09:50.500
Actually, I would doubt
it would be to your taste.

09:50.583 --> 09:53.709
Oh, it looks peachy, pumpkin.
Let's go in.

09:53.792 --> 09:55.834
As I was saying, somewhat fun.

09:56.750 --> 09:59.166
-Hey! That's my chair.
-Oh, yeah? No, it ain't.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.333
[chattering]

10:01.417 --> 10:03.166
Ew. Charming.

10:03.750 --> 10:06.375
You got that right, lady.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.041
Crazy.

10:08.417 --> 10:10.166
Hey, Baloo!

10:10.583 --> 10:13.792
Tell him to mind his manners,
or I'll break what he has of a neck.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.333
Oh... yeah.

10:17.041 --> 10:20.917
[chuckles]
My main man.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.291
Listen, Louie,
we've got some fancy-pants clients here,

10:24.375 --> 10:29.166
and they mean a lot to Rebecca,
so be on your best behavior, OK.

10:29.250 --> 10:34.834
-Say no more. Those them?
-Yeah. Muffy and Buffy.

10:34.917 --> 10:37.333
-Which is which?
-I don't know.

10:37.417 --> 10:40.917
Hi, I'm Louie. I dig your chapeau, Joe.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.458
-Baloo...
-Hey, he's just bein' friendly.

10:44.542 --> 10:47.583
Hello, gorgeous.

10:49.667 --> 10:53.417
-How's that for class?
-We really can't stay.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.750
Come now, let me show you
to my very best table,

10:56.834 --> 10:59.792
it's the one I reserve for headhunters.

11:01.458 --> 11:04.375
Waiter, my fork's dirty.

11:04.458 --> 11:07.083
Man, oh, man, am I sorry.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.375
[wheezes]

11:09.458 --> 11:11.375
There. Good as new.

11:11.458 --> 11:15.125
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some business to attend to.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.166
The man is disgusting.

11:17.250 --> 11:20.333
What? Too scruffy?

11:20.333 --> 11:23.291
Buffykins, I need to go freshen up.

11:23.583 --> 11:27.875
Wait, precious metals.
I shan't let you wander around here alone.

11:27.959 --> 11:30.709
Baloo, I'm going insane,
and I'm taking you with me.

11:30.792 --> 11:33.333
I thought I told you
to talk to Louie and make him behave.

11:33.417 --> 11:35.458
I did. He is.

11:35.542 --> 11:37.041
[unscrewing bolts]

11:44.875 --> 11:48.625
[Buffy gasps] Have you seen
what's written in the restroom?

11:48.709 --> 11:52.208
-Uh, when would you like to leave?
-Yesterday.

11:52.458 --> 11:55.500
-Baloo, have you seen my purse?
-Huh-uh.

11:55.583 --> 11:58.000
It's stolen. Do something.

11:58.083 --> 11:59.542
OK. What?

11:59.625 --> 12:03.458
I'd talk to that unsavory Louie fellow.
It's his place, you know.

12:03.542 --> 12:07.000
Buffy's right. You confront
that friend of yours right now.

12:07.166 --> 12:09.500
OK, OK, OK.

12:09.792 --> 12:12.083
[Louie scatting]

12:12.166 --> 12:15.208
Hey, Baloo, what can Louie do for you?

12:15.291 --> 12:17.959
Well, um... this isn't easy.

12:18.500 --> 12:23.709
Uh, it's Rebecca, you see.
She's kinda bent out of shape.

12:23.792 --> 12:28.000
[laughing]
Her shape looks fine to old Louie.

12:28.083 --> 12:33.417
Well, I hate to ask,
but Rebecca's purse is missin',

12:33.500 --> 12:38.667
-and she thought that maybe--
-That someone in my place took it, right?

12:39.709 --> 12:43.166
Now, lookie here, Baloo,
you and I have been buds a long time.

12:43.291 --> 12:45.792
Believe me, I know everybody here.

12:45.875 --> 12:50.667
And they're rough on the edges,
but they're not crooks, OK?

12:50.750 --> 12:52.208
Yeah, I know.

12:52.291 --> 12:56.083
-Well, keep your eyes open, will ya?
-Count on it, cuz.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.166
Hey. What's that?

12:59.375 --> 13:04.041
Well, pluck my face.
One of the waiters must've found it.

13:04.125 --> 13:08.375
Whew. Thanks, Louie.
You saved my skin.

13:08.458 --> 13:10.041
Dig you later.

13:10.959 --> 13:12.250
Yo! Got it.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.959
Baloo, you're wonderful.

13:15.041 --> 13:18.166
You better believe it.
It was in Louie's office.

13:18.417 --> 13:21.750
See, I knew that beastly man stole it.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.875
Hey, he didn't steal it.

13:23.959 --> 13:26.959
The longer we're here,
the great the risk to our diamonds.

13:27.041 --> 13:30.375
They're right, Baloo.
He's a sleazy lowlife jerk.

13:30.458 --> 13:34.417
Just because he isn't dressed like you,
doesn't mean you're better than him.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.625
Oh, please, let's just get out of here.

13:38.583 --> 13:41.083
[howling]

13:41.333 --> 13:43.750
-Plane all filled up?
-Yep.

13:43.834 --> 13:46.750
-Then we're ready to go.
-Nope.

13:46.834 --> 13:49.083
-What?
-Bad news. Plane sabotaged.

13:49.166 --> 13:51.500
-Sabo-what?
-Taged. Part missing.

13:51.583 --> 13:56.583
Oh! It's a plot! They're trying to
keep us here so they can steal my jewels!

13:56.667 --> 13:59.875
Relax. We got new part
ready first thing morning.

13:59.959 --> 14:02.625
I guess that means we'll have to
stay here overnight.

14:02.709 --> 14:06.625
Stay? Here? Oh...

14:07.000 --> 14:09.917
Wouldn't she be great
to take on a camping trip?

14:10.625 --> 14:13.750
It's great to have you
as my guests tonight.

14:13.834 --> 14:16.041
I've got you the best rooms in the place.

14:16.125 --> 14:17.917
La-di-da.

14:18.208 --> 14:22.542
Rebecca, did I ever tell you
that I love your hair?

14:22.625 --> 14:26.959
-Only 32 times.
-And what fabulous teeth.

14:27.041 --> 14:28.834
The better to bite him with.

14:30.250 --> 14:34.083
And such nice pearls.
South Seas. Am I right?

14:34.250 --> 14:35.917
Baloo.

14:36.083 --> 14:38.417
Louie. Easy.

14:38.500 --> 14:42.166
Is it me, or does she seem a little cold?

14:42.250 --> 14:44.625
Like a vampirian icebox.

14:44.709 --> 14:47.208
Well, maybe this will warm her up.

14:48.792 --> 14:51.458
Hello, cats and catettes.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.583
I'd like to dedicate this next number

14:53.667 --> 14:58.417
to my close personal friend of mine,
Ms. Rebecca Cunningham.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.750
Hit it, maestro.

14:59.834 --> 15:01.166
[upbeat music plays]

15:04.458 --> 15:05.291
Baloo!

15:05.375 --> 15:06.875
[yells]

15:07.125 --> 15:09.000
Let me down, you big ape!

15:23.250 --> 15:25.709
[crowd laughing]

15:25.792 --> 15:28.166
[laughs]
I think she likes me.

15:28.250 --> 15:31.125
Baloo, I'll never forgive you
for bringing us here.

15:31.208 --> 15:34.834
Oh, deariekins, weren't you
wearing a necklace?

15:34.917 --> 15:39.250
-[gasps] My pearls!
-Someone must have taken them.

15:39.917 --> 15:41.250
Louie?

15:41.333 --> 15:43.500
He was admiring them at dinner.

15:43.583 --> 15:45.583
And he did dance with you.

15:45.667 --> 15:49.125
First her purse.
Then her pearls.

15:49.208 --> 15:52.333
Next that thief will take our diamonds.

15:52.542 --> 15:56.125
And remember, Baloo,
if anything happens to those diamonds,

15:56.208 --> 15:59.208
-the plane goes.
-My plane!

15:59.291 --> 16:01.458
Let me handle this.

16:02.625 --> 16:04.792
Hey, what's the pulse, Baloo?

16:04.875 --> 16:08.667
You creep!
I'm gonna lose my plane because of you!

16:08.750 --> 16:12.750
-Huh?
-You stole Rebecca's purse and necklace.

16:12.834 --> 16:18.125
Hey, man, you're wrinkling the silk.
I didn't take anything.

16:18.709 --> 16:21.333
Well...
Hey, where did that come from?

16:21.625 --> 16:23.375
I guess Rebecca was right.

16:23.458 --> 16:26.667
You can judge a book by its cover.

16:38.917 --> 16:39.834
Here.

16:39.917 --> 16:42.542
If you need me,
I'll be guardin' those jewels.

16:43.458 --> 16:46.750
I guess you were right
about Louie after all.

16:49.625 --> 16:51.834
I'm so sorry, Baloo.

16:53.583 --> 16:58.291
If Louie shows his face,
this flare gun will light up his life.

17:01.625 --> 17:04.165
People just let you down.

17:04.375 --> 17:06.000
[yawning]

17:06.083 --> 17:07.750
They just let you down.

17:09.541 --> 17:10.959
You can't trust...

17:12.290 --> 17:13.709
Big stinker.

17:19.458 --> 17:21.834
[Muffy yells]

17:21.916 --> 17:26.083
My jewels!
My precious jewels have been stolen!

17:26.165 --> 17:27.290
Stolen?

17:27.375 --> 17:32.375
Oh, they were right next to the bed
last night and now they're gone!

17:32.458 --> 17:36.500
-It's impossible.
-They have to be here!

17:38.291 --> 17:41.000
-You'll pay for this, young lady.
-But... But...

17:41.083 --> 17:45.166
Look, I'm sorry.
Don't go yet. We'll find them, I promise.

17:45.250 --> 17:47.583
Don't you even try to apologize.

17:47.667 --> 17:51.125
We should've known
when we saw your shabby little office.

17:51.208 --> 17:54.333
Now we're taking the plane.
Ha!

17:55.667 --> 17:57.375
[clattering]

17:57.458 --> 17:58.333
Nope.

17:58.500 --> 17:59.667
[engine starts]

17:59.750 --> 18:01.500
The plane!

18:09.208 --> 18:11.000
Come back, Baloo!

18:16.792 --> 18:18.125
My plane! My...

18:20.125 --> 18:21.333
[clanging]

18:26.083 --> 18:27.583
What's all the ruckus?

18:29.750 --> 18:33.000
-This is all your fault!
-Unwind yourself.

18:33.083 --> 18:35.667
Let me go, you thief!

18:35.959 --> 18:38.834
Let's take it from the downbeat, cupcake.

18:38.917 --> 18:42.583
I didn't steal those rocks.
Those upper-crust crumbs set me up.

18:42.667 --> 18:44.834
How dare you talk about--

18:44.917 --> 18:48.417
-Did he ever pay you?
-Well, of course. See?

18:50.000 --> 18:55.583
The old disappearin' ink routine.
Baby, those high rollers are lowlifes.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.959
Crooks? Them?

18:58.041 --> 19:01.000
Hey, boss, look what we found
dumped in the bushes.

19:07.959 --> 19:10.291
See? Glass.

19:10.709 --> 19:14.208
I did some checking this morning.
They're wanted for fraud.

19:14.291 --> 19:17.875
That means Baloo was right.
They were phonies.

19:17.959 --> 19:19.667
Baloo was right?

19:20.625 --> 19:22.542
Let's go after 'em, sugar cubes.

19:22.625 --> 19:26.333
-You'd help me?
-Affirmative, toots.

19:30.333 --> 19:33.250
-Now climb in.
-But there's no engine.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.875
Not to worry.
[whistles]

19:47.583 --> 19:51.959
-Alone at last.
-I've treated you very badly, Louie.

19:52.041 --> 19:55.166
I guess I couldn't see
past your shaggy looks.

19:55.250 --> 19:58.667
Baloo was right,
I've been judging people all wrong.

19:58.750 --> 20:02.458
-Oh, it could happen to anyone.
-I'm really sorry.

20:02.542 --> 20:06.417
Oh, love means never havin'
to say you're sorry, baby.

20:07.125 --> 20:10.166
[laughs] Do you believe
that dumb dame fell for this?

20:10.250 --> 20:14.125
She probably still thinks that
moronic monkey took her pearls, too.

20:14.208 --> 20:15.041
[laughs]

20:15.709 --> 20:18.583
-Hey, we're bein' followed.
-Oh! It's them!

20:21.959 --> 20:24.000
Well, we'll lose 'em over that island.

20:24.083 --> 20:25.959
Jump! Jump!

20:26.041 --> 20:27.542
Just a little farther.

20:35.083 --> 20:36.792
Go get 'em!

20:40.625 --> 20:43.417
We finally lost those bozos.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.667
[Rebecca]
Ms. Bozo to you, flathead.

20:46.458 --> 20:47.792
Shall we?

20:49.667 --> 20:50.792
[yells]

20:54.250 --> 20:55.291
That's that.

20:57.875 --> 20:59.417
[both yelling]

21:07.583 --> 21:09.208
[Muffy yelling]

21:11.375 --> 21:13.709
Ah-ah-ah.
Where's your manners?

21:13.792 --> 21:17.458
Don't you touch me,
you sleazy, lowlife jerk!

21:17.542 --> 21:20.583
I don't let people
talk to my friends like that!

21:21.041 --> 21:22.625
[punching]

21:23.917 --> 21:28.667
Say, you better get some ice for that eye,
it may get a little puffy.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.500
[laughing]

21:30.583 --> 21:32.625
Give me some skin, mama.

21:34.750 --> 21:37.959
-[Baloo snoring]
-[Rebecca] Wake up, flyboy.

21:39.250 --> 21:44.959
-How are you feeling?
-Ooh, I had the worst dream, Rebecca.

21:45.083 --> 21:49.000
These snobby people
who talked funny stole our plane.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.083
You weren't dreaming, Baloo.

21:51.166 --> 21:55.750
But my good pal here got it back for us.
Right, Louie?

21:55.834 --> 22:01.083
-Right, Becky baby.
-Good pal? Becky baby?

22:01.166 --> 22:03.375
Now I know I'm dreamin'.

22:03.458 --> 22:07.375
Louie, this could be the start
of a beautiful friendship.

22:15.750 --> 22:18.875
Bleach!
