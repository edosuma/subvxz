WEBVTT

00:04.961 --> 00:08.269
Vape pods, one-hitters,
Goldschlager!

00:08.312 --> 00:10.967
I can't tell you how
disappointed I am in all of you.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.447
Where's the <i>good</i> stuff?!

00:12.490 --> 00:15.189
I've got a flight to Cabo
in forty minutes!

00:15.232 --> 00:18.366
Principal Lewis has no right
to invade our privacy like this.

00:18.409 --> 00:20.933
Relax. We're gonna
be lousy with privacy

00:20.977 --> 00:22.631
all summer
down at the hole.

00:22.674 --> 00:25.808
You guys got something
special planned for break?

00:25.851 --> 00:27.636
Snot and I spend
every summer

00:27.679 --> 00:30.508
at a super secret
swimming hole outside town,

00:30.552 --> 00:32.293
just working
on our slack shack,

00:32.336 --> 00:34.512
catching fish,
and practicing make-outs

00:34.556 --> 00:37.080
on a smooth log we hauled
out of a beaver dam.

00:37.124 --> 00:39.213
Can I come?
Sorry, Billy.

00:39.256 --> 00:42.085
Not even Barry or Toshi
know about the old hole.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.087
And it's not on any map.

00:44.131 --> 00:45.697
Well, there's
a lyrical map...

00:45.741 --> 00:48.135
That we vowed
never to repeat

00:48.178 --> 00:49.571
in front
of other people.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.181
I could just hum you
the melody.

00:51.225 --> 00:52.617
I'm good.

00:52.661 --> 00:54.315
Fine,
words and everything!

01:00.234 --> 01:02.105
Principal Lewis: Smith!
What's with the fish?!

01:03.237 --> 01:06.153
I'm sorry, Steve. I smuggled
myself in your backpack.

01:06.196 --> 01:08.938
The lunch ladies throw
a killer end-of-the-year party

01:08.981 --> 01:10.635
and make a timpano
out of everything

01:10.679 --> 01:12.985
that's left
in the cafeteria.

01:13.029 --> 01:15.684
Last year, there was
a whole kid in there.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.251
He was delicious.

01:17.294 --> 01:18.861
Hmm.

01:18.904 --> 01:22.430
A fish that parties and
isn't afraid to bend the rules?

01:22.473 --> 01:23.953
Good. You're with me.

01:23.996 --> 01:26.390
I'm taking your pet as
my emotional support animal.

01:26.434 --> 01:29.045
BRRIIIIING!
That's the bell.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.961
Lose yourself
to the summer, bitches!

01:57.595 --> 01:58.640
Aah!

02:11.261 --> 02:13.872
No, no, no!
The slack shack!

02:13.916 --> 02:15.135
We gotta call the cops!

02:15.178 --> 02:16.658
And tell them what?

02:16.701 --> 02:19.356
That somebody threw a party
out in the woods?

02:21.967 --> 02:24.666
I was wrong! -We need
to leave! -What is it?

02:24.709 --> 02:27.408
Did you see a Ziploc and think
it was a jellyfish again?

02:30.585 --> 02:32.804
Oh, my God!

02:32.848 --> 02:35.459
Talk about
your lucky break!

02:35.503 --> 02:37.548
Now the cops <i>
have to</i> get involved!

02:37.592 --> 02:39.898
This murder is just
the thing we need

02:39.942 --> 02:41.987
to catch the bastards
who ruined my hole!

02:42.031 --> 02:43.946
- Our hole.
- That's what I said.

02:43.989 --> 02:48.298
Jesus, Snot, you see one dead
body, and you're all "our hole."

02:51.736 --> 02:53.738
-Here. Put this on.
-Oh, no.

02:53.782 --> 02:57.351
I take the job of emotional
support <i>very</i> seriously.

02:57.394 --> 02:59.918
I'm not wearing that
until I've earned it.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.485
Suit yourself.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.705
I just need you to get me
from the airport to the hotel.

03:03.748 --> 03:06.229
I gulped up that whole bag
of the kids' contraband.

03:06.273 --> 03:07.796
Gotta get a good
baseline high

03:07.839 --> 03:10.233
just to hit the ground running
with my Cabo crew.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.583
Cabo crew?
Hell yeah!

03:12.627 --> 03:15.020
The wildest group of guys
you've ever met.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.892
One night we blacked out
and woke up on horses

03:16.935 --> 03:19.111
carrying a sack
of gold teeth!

03:19.155 --> 03:21.418
We made a pact right then
we'd come back in a decade

03:21.462 --> 03:23.203
and do it all again.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.683
Well, someone's
clearly feeling

03:25.727 --> 03:27.555
your party vibe already.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.559
Once again, we'd like
to invite all seniors

03:31.602 --> 03:33.343
to pre-board
at this time.

03:33.387 --> 03:34.997
I'm looking at you, fishnet.

03:35.040 --> 03:38.043
Well. This stings right
through the painkillers.

03:38.087 --> 03:40.394
You kidding, bro?
It's a neg.

03:40.437 --> 03:44.180
She's dogging you so you'll be
insecure enough to hook up!

03:44.224 --> 03:45.834
Cool!

03:48.532 --> 03:49.968
Would you like
a wheelchair

03:50.012 --> 03:51.405
waiting for you
at the other end, sir?

03:51.448 --> 03:54.973
Oh, brutal!
She wants you bad.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.890
These directions suck!

03:58.934 --> 04:02.546
We hit a thicket, but I wouldn't
call it "dappled with light."

04:04.679 --> 04:06.420
Hi. We called
about the body.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.552
Yeah, yeah.
Give us a second, kid.

04:08.596 --> 04:11.599
Look at this place!
It's got...

04:11.642 --> 04:12.991
What's the word
I'm looking for?

04:13.035 --> 04:14.254
Splendor.
Splendor!

04:14.297 --> 04:15.820
That's it! Yes!

04:15.864 --> 04:18.780
Needs some cleaning, though,
but the potential is unreal.

04:18.823 --> 04:20.564
Look, do you want
to see the body or not?

04:20.608 --> 04:23.306
Oh, we've seen plenty.

04:23.350 --> 04:26.744
This case is gonna be harder
to solve than we thought.

04:26.788 --> 04:29.312
We're gonna have to close
this area off for months.

04:29.356 --> 04:32.228
Maybe longer. I heard it's
supposed to be an Indian summer.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.969
Uh, we're gonna need
backup out here.

04:34.012 --> 04:35.536
Get everyone
from the station.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.364
Months?
You're kidding, right?

04:37.407 --> 04:39.931
Kidding?!
There's been a murder, kid.

04:39.975 --> 04:42.194
- What are you, sick?
- Yeah, what are you, sick?

04:42.238 --> 04:44.327
And, uh, bring
some beach towels.

04:47.199 --> 04:49.811
Oh, good. Steve.
How are you with a needle?

04:49.854 --> 04:53.293
I caught the summer bug and cut
all my pants into Daisy Dukes.

04:53.336 --> 04:56.644
Turns out it is <i>not</i> a flattering
look for my body type.

04:56.687 --> 04:59.951
I actually want to talk to you
about a potential case.

04:59.995 --> 05:01.344
What kind of case?

05:01.388 --> 05:04.347
Upper? Brief?
Of the Mondays?

05:04.391 --> 05:05.696
Murder!

05:05.740 --> 05:08.656
Ahh, an old classic.
Go on.

05:08.699 --> 05:11.572
Someone got murdered
at my secret swimming hole,

05:11.615 --> 05:14.226
but the police are dragging
their feet solving it

05:14.270 --> 05:15.880
because they want the hole
for themselves!

05:15.924 --> 05:17.317
It's ridiculous!

05:17.360 --> 05:20.015
Ridiculously smart.
That's what I'd do.

05:20.058 --> 05:23.584
The way I see it, there's only
one way this case gets solved--

05:23.627 --> 05:25.150
I need
Wheels and the Legman.

05:25.194 --> 05:27.152
What do you say, partner?

05:27.196 --> 05:29.067
No way.
What? W-Why?!

05:29.111 --> 05:31.418
You know we don't work cases
we're too close to.

05:31.461 --> 05:33.463
I promise
I'm not too close.

05:33.507 --> 05:36.640
Roger, a man's been murdered,
and no one seems to care.

05:36.684 --> 05:38.294
Do <i>you?</i>
I don't know yet.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.079
I usually only like the cases
where it turns out I did it,

05:41.123 --> 05:42.603
and this is definitely
not one of those.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.169
That's strike one.

05:44.213 --> 05:46.955
I'm also very worried
about your motives. Strike two.

05:46.998 --> 05:49.871
Fortunately there's no strike
three and a murder sounds fun!

05:49.914 --> 05:51.133
Let's do it!

06:03.275 --> 06:05.539
I know. Don't say anything.
They don't work.

06:05.582 --> 06:08.019
Would have been a cool thing
for Legman, though, right?

06:08.063 --> 06:10.195
Imagine me kicking ass
in these.

06:10.239 --> 06:13.024
I guess I could be
talked into them.

06:13.068 --> 06:15.462
Christ, Steve.
Say <i>something!</i>

06:18.508 --> 06:22.077
Not that I don't appreciate
your dedication to character,

06:22.120 --> 06:24.775
but I wouldn't judge you if you
wanted to walk this part,

06:24.819 --> 06:25.950
hop back in at the hole?

06:25.994 --> 06:27.343
We're here. Oh.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.998
Oh!
This place is gorgeous!

06:30.041 --> 06:31.565
If it was mine
and someone took it,

06:31.608 --> 06:33.131
I'd want revenge bad.

06:33.175 --> 06:34.916
That's not what this is
about for you, though.

06:34.959 --> 06:36.831
No.
It's not personal.

06:36.874 --> 06:39.921
Now, come on.
Let's nail down a timeline.

06:40.878 --> 06:44.099
The night started over here
with a feast of some sort.

06:46.536 --> 06:49.931
Old Bay seasoning.

06:49.974 --> 06:51.846
That's nice
on a summer evening.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.935
I'm allowed
to touch stuff, right?

06:53.978 --> 06:56.938
Then the drinking started. There.

06:59.723 --> 07:02.334
2020. Great year.

07:02.378 --> 07:04.772
Not sure how it was
for wine, though.

07:04.815 --> 07:07.035
And then things got ugly.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.390
Good party.
They did it right.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.826
Are you done, Legman?!

07:15.870 --> 07:18.307
Whoa, Wheels. Testy. Sorry.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.135
No. Teste. Up there.

07:20.178 --> 07:21.615
Looks like
a dude's ball.

07:21.658 --> 07:24.226
A clue!
Good eye, partner!

07:26.533 --> 07:29.884
I got something else.
I'd know these tracks anywhere.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.625
Someone had sex here!

07:31.668 --> 07:34.323
Let me cross-reference
with the forensics database.

07:35.846 --> 07:38.370
Damn. No hits.
Out-of-towners.

07:38.414 --> 07:39.676
Hey! What's this?

07:39.720 --> 07:40.982
A salt lick?

07:41.025 --> 07:43.419
A salt lick!
And there you have it!

07:43.463 --> 07:46.466
The Case of the Dirt Sex
Salt Lick closed!

07:46.509 --> 07:47.684
What's next?

07:47.728 --> 07:49.860
-A murder case?
-Ooo, that sounds fun.

07:49.904 --> 07:51.949
As long as you're
not too close to it.

07:54.517 --> 07:57.085
What are we doing
at the docks, Legman?

07:57.128 --> 07:59.348
In every crime show,
murder investigations

07:59.391 --> 08:00.828
have to go to the docks.

08:00.871 --> 08:02.482
There are answers here,

08:02.525 --> 08:04.788
and a guy unloading stuff
has them.

08:04.832 --> 08:07.095
Yeah, I knew him.
Real squirrelly.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.400
Always looking
over his shoulder.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.664
Said she just got done
with rehab,

08:10.707 --> 08:12.753
but the tracks on her arm
said different.

08:12.796 --> 08:15.320
The guy still owes me
thirty bucks.

08:15.364 --> 08:17.801
You ever have anyone
owe you thirty bucks?

08:17.845 --> 08:19.107
Not fun.

08:19.150 --> 08:20.630
This guy's open.
Hey, you!

08:20.674 --> 08:22.676
There's a swimming hole
an hour from here.

08:22.719 --> 08:24.634
-Sounds nice.
-It <i>was</i> nice.

08:24.678 --> 08:27.942
Until a body turned up at the
bottom of it. Know anything?

08:27.985 --> 08:30.161
Not about that.
I <i>do</i> know about some murders

08:30.205 --> 08:31.989
that happened at a farmhouse
last spring.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.643
See, I did them.

08:33.687 --> 08:36.298
Uch! This guy's
a total dead end! Let's go!

08:36.341 --> 08:37.908
Wait. Legman, look!

08:38.953 --> 08:40.563
That's no coincidence.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.478
Here, take a break
and get one of those beers

08:42.522 --> 08:44.436
with a raw egg in it
you guys like.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.656
Gee, thanks, mister!

08:46.700 --> 08:51.269
Well, partner, what do you say
we bust this case wide open?

08:52.836 --> 08:55.099
-Weird fruits?
-You take this one, Wheels.

08:55.143 --> 08:56.623
You haven't had
any good quips yet.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.102
We don't have time
for that.

08:58.146 --> 09:00.148
We need to find out where
this shipment is going.

09:00.191 --> 09:04.326
Uhh, guess the docks weren't
exactly fruitless after all.

09:04.369 --> 09:06.850
This case is seedy
any way you slice--

09:06.894 --> 09:09.549
Get in!
I found a delivery address!

09:09.592 --> 09:11.812
What are you doing, Wheels?!
You can't steal this truck!

09:11.855 --> 09:14.641
Not with those little
noodle legs. Scooch over.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.338
We're in hot purfruit?

09:16.381 --> 09:17.557
Just drive.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.210
That was funny, Wheels.

09:19.254 --> 09:21.256
You're <i>sure</i> you're not
too close to this case?

09:21.299 --> 09:23.127
I just want justice.

09:24.302 --> 09:25.477
Juicetice.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.131
Not terrible!

09:29.656 --> 09:33.529
So you can't meet in Mexico
because of your grandkids?

09:33.573 --> 09:36.140
No, I get it.
Y-You've got responsibilities.

09:36.184 --> 09:38.447
Heh. Me? Umm...

09:38.490 --> 09:39.970
I'm not going down there, either.

09:40.014 --> 09:43.365
Okay. Take care.

09:43.408 --> 09:46.760
Well, that's the whole crew.
They all bailed.

09:46.803 --> 09:49.719
Klaus, am I a fool
for coming here?

09:49.763 --> 09:52.940
What?! Screw those guys.
They broke a pact.

09:52.983 --> 09:55.246
Bro, come here.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.640
You know what I see
in there?

09:57.684 --> 09:59.120
A big idiot.

09:59.163 --> 10:01.339
No. Balls.

10:01.383 --> 10:02.906
Those cowards got scared

10:02.950 --> 10:04.647
and gave away the most important
thing they had--

10:04.691 --> 10:06.606
their freedom.

10:06.649 --> 10:09.304
We're lucky they aren't here
to hold us back.

10:09.347 --> 10:10.653
They would've tried to...

10:10.697 --> 10:12.916
drag us to a shell museum
or something!

10:12.960 --> 10:14.831
Yeah. Maybe.

10:14.875 --> 10:18.052
But guys like us
don't need shells, do we?

10:18.095 --> 10:20.141
Shells slow you down.
Right!

10:20.184 --> 10:23.318
We need to be
out there and free!

10:23.361 --> 10:25.581
Yeah!
I'm not some snail!

10:25.625 --> 10:28.236
If anything,
the opposite!

10:28.279 --> 10:29.541
I'm a...

10:29.585 --> 10:31.239
a slug!

10:31.282 --> 10:32.980
A slug!

10:33.023 --> 10:35.635
I'm a brave sluuuug!

10:38.159 --> 10:40.944
Not yet. Soon.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.168
Something
doesn't add up.

10:47.211 --> 10:48.604
Couldn't agree more.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.998
The Asian pears here
are 90 cents a pound

10:51.041 --> 10:52.347
and the size of my head.

10:52.390 --> 10:53.827
Who's crunching
their numbers?

10:53.870 --> 10:55.785
That's the last of it
then?

10:55.829 --> 10:58.483
Will you boys take
some coffee for the road?

10:58.527 --> 10:59.876
yeah.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.922
-I gotta hit the head.
-I better join him.

11:01.965 --> 11:04.533
I like to watch him fumble
with his dingaling.

11:07.449 --> 11:08.842
Help me get this rug up.

11:10.495 --> 11:11.975
Bingo!

11:28.731 --> 11:30.777
They're making that fruit
into drugs!

11:30.820 --> 11:32.692
I think we're in
over our heads here, partner.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.476
Wait. That package
has an address.

11:34.519 --> 11:37.131
Drug cook: Hey, a guy!

11:37.174 --> 11:40.612
Got it! 2113 Franklin!
Go! Go

11:40.656 --> 11:42.919
You forgot your coffees!

11:47.271 --> 11:49.056
Yeesh.
Nasty place.

11:49.099 --> 11:50.492
But we got the drop spot.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.233
Feels like a good time
to call the cops

11:52.276 --> 11:54.322
and clue 'em into the drug ring
we just uncovered.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.193
I'm going in.

11:56.237 --> 11:58.108
Are you coming?

12:01.416 --> 12:04.462
Look at that.
They dose by licking it.

12:04.506 --> 12:05.681
Almost like a--

12:05.725 --> 12:07.161
Salt lick.

12:11.905 --> 12:13.036
Wheels, it's--

12:13.080 --> 12:14.646
The symbol!
He's part of it!

12:14.690 --> 12:17.040
Okay. You're also
interrupting me a lot lately.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.781
You piece
of shit! Wheels?

12:18.825 --> 12:20.087
Tell me everything
you know!

12:20.130 --> 12:21.305
The door locked somehow.

12:21.349 --> 12:22.916
Who was there?!

12:22.959 --> 12:25.657
I'm really starting to worry
you're too close to this one.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.094
Steve?!

12:28.965 --> 12:31.707
The tattoo is for
a secret society.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.405
They run drugs
to fund their rituals.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.581
But they've gone underground
now that the cops are crawling

12:36.625 --> 12:38.758
all over their
ceremonial site--

12:38.801 --> 12:40.803
The Old Hole.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.631
Okay.
All good intel.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.676
Noticed you still have
a few teeth stuck

12:44.720 --> 12:45.939
in your knuckles there.

12:47.505 --> 12:50.770
You still want to turn this
over to the police? Fine.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.162
They can take it
from here.

12:52.206 --> 12:53.947
You mean it?
Yep.

12:53.990 --> 12:56.384
Someone will probably even make
detective off this case

12:56.427 --> 12:57.864
with all this...

12:57.907 --> 12:59.691
low hanging fruit.

12:59.735 --> 13:01.302
There's my Wheels!

13:01.345 --> 13:04.609
Then I gotta put my face
in a mattress for a few hours.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.568
All my thoughts
are shattered glass.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.222
What a cool thing to say!

13:08.265 --> 13:09.745
I'm a little afraid
of you now,

13:09.789 --> 13:12.182
but the new vernacular
is dynamite!

13:13.880 --> 13:16.621
Nope. Carrying you wasn't
the right choice, either.

13:16.665 --> 13:18.493
Worse, actually,
in a lot of ways.

13:18.536 --> 13:20.364
Wake up.
It's your lucky day.

13:29.069 --> 13:32.115
Oh, my God!
It wasn't a stabbing at all!

13:32.159 --> 13:35.162
A goddamn deer did it!

13:35.205 --> 13:37.468
I mean, right?
I never actually saw the body.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.557
That's what we're
gasping about, right?

13:39.601 --> 13:42.430
Well, we can't thank you enough
for all of this.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.475
I guess there's only one thing
left to do now.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.913
Kunnngh!

13:46.956 --> 13:48.610
Close the books!

13:50.177 --> 13:52.353
It's always easier
when animals do it.

13:52.396 --> 13:54.268
No messy motive, no trial.

13:54.311 --> 13:56.531
Just nature
running her course.

13:56.574 --> 13:57.880
That's it?!

13:57.924 --> 14:00.056
B-But the drug ring,
t-the secret society!

14:00.100 --> 14:03.190
Officially
none of our beeswax.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.322
I'm not even sure
this stuff's illegal.

14:05.366 --> 14:07.890
Mahalo, you two.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.761
Well, we solved
our first murder.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.372
It's not fair!

14:11.415 --> 14:13.853
They were supposed to hurt
the people who hurt me!

14:13.896 --> 14:17.117
What?! So this was never
about the murder for you?

14:17.160 --> 14:19.336
I feel completely
blindsided here.

14:19.380 --> 14:21.121
We did <i>everything</i>
for the police,

14:21.164 --> 14:23.906
and they're still not gonna
punish these scumbags!

14:23.950 --> 14:26.256
Oh, I don't expect you
to understand,

14:26.300 --> 14:28.998
because you've never had
something as pure as my hole...

14:29.042 --> 14:31.914
and then had to see it
defiled by strangers!

14:31.958 --> 14:34.482
I can't just turn my back
while a group of thugs

14:34.525 --> 14:37.137
comes into my hole
and violates it!

14:37.180 --> 14:39.835
I'm-- I'm finding
your word choice

14:39.879 --> 14:41.968
is making it
difficult to focus.

14:42.011 --> 14:44.405
You lied to me!
We were partners!

14:44.448 --> 14:46.276
"Were"?
I'm sorry.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.888
Legman is walking out
on this team.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.847
Right after I get you
back down the hill.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.283
And the car ride home.

14:53.327 --> 14:55.416
And maybe a celebratory dinner
somewhere nice.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.026
After that, we're done!

15:01.465 --> 15:03.511
Hi, Uncle Roger.
Is Steve around?

15:03.554 --> 15:05.078
He's not answering
my calls.

15:05.121 --> 15:07.428
I'm not surprised.
He had a bad break-up.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.647
I heard the other guy's
fine, though.

15:09.691 --> 15:12.563
STEEEEVE!

15:12.607 --> 15:15.044
Guess he's not here, because
he usually responds to that.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.090
Well, come in, already!
Let's find him.

15:17.873 --> 15:20.093
Son of a bitch!
He's still working it!

15:20.136 --> 15:21.877
There's a chat log here.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.228
Something called The Secret
Order of the Summer Buck.

15:25.272 --> 15:26.577
What <i>is</i> all this?

15:26.621 --> 15:28.057
I don't have time
to explain it to you!

15:28.101 --> 15:30.712
I think Steve infiltrated
the secret society

15:30.755 --> 15:34.063
that threw a party at your
swimming hole to exact revenge.

15:34.107 --> 15:36.109
Actually that's--
that's basically it.

15:36.152 --> 15:39.721
This says the police are gone
and the ritual is back on!

15:39.764 --> 15:41.853
Oh, my God! Steve is
going to the ritual!

15:41.897 --> 15:42.985
We gotta save him!

15:43.029 --> 15:44.465
Actually, you hang back.

15:44.508 --> 15:46.771
I'm feeling a bit of
a Snot overdose happening.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.251
Oh, that will happen.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.040
Ah-ah-ah. Did you forget
your robes, brother?

15:54.083 --> 15:55.389
Is that a problem?

15:55.432 --> 15:57.043
You know what I do?

15:57.086 --> 15:59.306
I keep an extra set in my car
just in case.

15:59.349 --> 16:01.134
And you know how many times
I've been in your position?

16:01.177 --> 16:02.352
Zero.

16:02.396 --> 16:03.745
Oh, one more thing.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.442
Our virgin fell through
for the evening,

16:05.486 --> 16:07.357
so it looks like
no sacrifice tonight.

16:07.401 --> 16:09.316
There's still plenty of
Albertsons pumpkin pies, though,

16:09.359 --> 16:11.318
so enjoy.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.802
- Unh!
- Get away from him!

16:17.846 --> 16:19.239
He can't lick your drugs!

16:19.282 --> 16:22.938
He... lost his tongue
in a motorcycle accident!

16:22.982 --> 16:24.984
Wheels,
before you say anything,

16:25.027 --> 16:26.942
I want to tell you
I'm sorry.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.944
Partners don't bail
on each other.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.339
How did you know
about my motorcycle accident?

16:32.382 --> 16:34.297
Damn.

16:34.341 --> 16:35.864
You've gotta be
kidding me!

16:35.907 --> 16:39.694
Steve, are you here?
These freaks kill virgins!

16:39.737 --> 16:41.130
Virgins like you!

16:41.174 --> 16:42.349
What are you doing?

16:42.392 --> 16:44.525
Steve!
I'm rescuing you.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.135
Oh.

16:46.179 --> 16:49.617
High priest: Seems we've found
a virgin after all.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.358
Quick, Steve,
have sex with someone!

16:51.401 --> 16:55.231
No! When it happens,
I want it to be special.

16:59.757 --> 17:02.456
One water for every drink
so we all stay hydrated.

17:02.499 --> 17:04.371
It does make you urinate
a lot more,

17:04.414 --> 17:06.764
but frankly I see that
as a positive.

17:06.808 --> 17:09.071
Anyway,
what do your dads do?

17:10.899 --> 17:12.466
Excuse us
for a second.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.076
What was that?!

17:14.120 --> 17:16.644
I don't know!
I couldn't stop myself!

17:16.687 --> 17:19.603
The crew was right.
I've aged out of this scene.

17:19.647 --> 17:22.563
Stop it! You haven't aged
out of anything.

17:22.606 --> 17:26.654
You've graduated into the most
important party role of all!

17:26.697 --> 17:27.829
I have?

17:27.872 --> 17:30.266
The party elder.

17:30.310 --> 17:33.182
Every rave, music festival,
and spring break

17:33.226 --> 17:35.228
has one thing in common--

17:35.271 --> 17:39.623
that lone older guy
who looks like he's seen it all.

17:39.667 --> 17:44.411
It's his job to act as a party
guide to the next generation.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.674
That's you now.

17:46.717 --> 17:49.720
The party elder.

17:51.244 --> 17:52.767
Look at those pupils!

17:52.810 --> 17:54.595
You're rolling hard,
and you just walked

17:54.638 --> 17:57.163
into a room full of mirrors,
like a fool!

17:57.206 --> 17:58.512
Get back out there!

17:58.555 --> 18:00.731
And stay away
from your own reflection!

18:07.129 --> 18:10.437
He gave me money.
My wisdom is my currency.

18:10.480 --> 18:14.832
I am the party elder!

18:14.876 --> 18:17.661
You earned this, Klaus.

18:21.491 --> 18:23.014
It feels a little weird

18:23.058 --> 18:25.278
sacrificing a handicapped
person, doesn't it?

18:25.321 --> 18:27.454
Ugh.
It's "differently abled," Peter.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.847
And we have to treat him
exactly like everyone else.

18:29.891 --> 18:31.980
-What if he's faking it?
-Oh, my God!

18:32.023 --> 18:34.809
That is, like, the main thing
you're not allowed to say.

18:34.852 --> 18:37.159
The man in the lake <i>
was</i> murdered.

18:37.203 --> 18:39.814
-He was a human sacrifice.
-I know that now!

18:39.857 --> 18:42.164
Just haven't figured out
how the deer fits in.

18:42.208 --> 18:45.646
High priest: It is time!
Bring forth the vessel.

18:46.734 --> 18:47.909
Ah.

18:47.952 --> 18:50.433
God of the Summer Cervus!

18:50.477 --> 18:54.220
Accept our humble offering
of virgin blood!

18:54.263 --> 18:56.918
And if you're up for it,
kill this other guy, too.

19:06.101 --> 19:08.886
Don't worry.
I've got a plan.

19:09.887 --> 19:11.759
Wait!
He <i>was</i> pretending?

19:11.802 --> 19:13.152
Boo!

19:16.764 --> 19:17.895
Go, Steve!

19:17.939 --> 19:19.201
Aah!

19:38.089 --> 19:39.308
Aah!

19:39.352 --> 19:40.614
Unh!

19:44.139 --> 19:47.055
Steve,
I need to apologize.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.231
I'm the one who
should be apologizing!

19:49.275 --> 19:51.581
My thirst for revenge
nearly killed us both!

19:51.625 --> 19:53.148
But your hole!

19:53.192 --> 19:56.020
The thing you loved the most
in the world recently!

19:56.064 --> 19:58.022
It never really <i>was</i> mine.

19:58.066 --> 20:01.112
I realized the Order didn't even
know they stole it from me,

20:01.156 --> 20:02.636
just like I didn't know
I stole it

20:02.679 --> 20:04.855
from that beaver,
the fish I caught,

20:04.899 --> 20:06.292
the bird eggs
I pulled from nests

20:06.335 --> 20:07.902
and threw at a big rock.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.947
I can't take things
so personally.

20:09.991 --> 20:11.949
You're a good person, Steve.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.255
And a good partner.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.996
You still want
to be partners?

20:15.039 --> 20:17.694
I do.
To the hospital, deer!

20:19.130 --> 20:22.177
So now I guess even the forest
service can't get to the hole

20:22.221 --> 20:24.135
because of all
the murderous animals.

20:24.179 --> 20:25.789
But I'm at peace.

20:25.833 --> 20:28.183
I realized there are more
important things in life

20:28.227 --> 20:30.664
than my own spot
or some silly revenge

20:30.707 --> 20:32.274
against the people
who took it from me.

20:32.318 --> 20:33.667
I don't know.

20:33.710 --> 20:35.973
It sounds like a lot
of those people are dead now

20:36.017 --> 20:37.279
because of you.

20:37.323 --> 20:38.585
Yeah, I'm not gonna
overthink it.

20:38.628 --> 20:40.413
This place isn't bad,
though, right?

20:40.456 --> 20:42.153
Hey, you can't be here!

20:42.197 --> 20:43.459
Alright, alright.

20:43.503 --> 20:45.766
Come on, Snot.
Help me get Steve out.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.246
The physical therapist said

20:47.289 --> 20:49.291
I might be out of this thing
by Christmas!

20:49.335 --> 20:52.729
Serves him right. Pretending
to be disabled like that.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.039
Have a great night!
