WEBVTT

00:15.143 --> 00:17.228
(TYRES SCREECHING)

00:34.954 --> 00:37.665
-Do you want a lift?
-Yes, thanks. Thank you.

00:42.962 --> 00:45.381
I'm Duncan,
I work with wolves.

00:45.465 --> 00:47.383
-What's your name?
-Esme.

00:47.467 --> 00:49.719
As in, "Is me tea ready?"

00:49.802 --> 00:54.349
-No, as in the old
French word for love.
-Right.

00:57.393 --> 00:58.644
Thanks.

01:08.780 --> 01:10.782
IRENE: Oh, very smart.

01:16.079 --> 01:18.706
Erm,
this could do with a dusting.

01:18.790 --> 01:22.460
-Not my job.
-It is your job.
I should know.

01:22.542 --> 01:24.504
The Wolf Centre opens
the day after tomorrow.

01:24.587 --> 01:27.256
Either I run
the catering business or
I polish tables.

01:27.340 --> 01:29.550
If you want me to do both,
I'll need help.

01:29.634 --> 01:32.595
Well,
what do you want me to do,
wave my magic wand?

01:32.679 --> 01:34.597
-DUNCAN: Lexie.
-What?

01:34.681 --> 01:36.098
Got any jobs going?

01:36.182 --> 01:38.267
Hi. I'm Esme.

02:20.226 --> 02:21.769
(DOOR CLOSING)

02:22.812 --> 02:24.313
LEXIE: Ooh.

02:24.397 --> 02:26.399
What's this?
A wedding present?

02:26.482 --> 02:31.237
Er, no,
no, it's for my presentation
to Wildlife Scotland.

02:31.320 --> 02:35.450
The visitors' centre,
the wolf pen with wolves,

02:35.533 --> 02:37.410
the wildlife trails...

02:37.493 --> 02:39.579
This must have
cost a fair wee bit.

02:39.662 --> 02:43.291
Yeah, but if it helps persuade
them to give us the grant,
then it's money well spent.

02:43.374 --> 02:45.752
(SIGHING) You know
what's wrong with it,
don't you?

02:47.128 --> 02:49.881
-There's no visitors.
-There will be.

02:49.964 --> 02:51.507
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

02:55.470 --> 02:59.556
-You wanted to see me?
-Yeah. Is everything
ready for the move?

02:59.640 --> 03:02.268
Ready when you are.

03:02.352 --> 03:06.814
Erm, Lexie and I
discussed it again yesterday

03:06.898 --> 03:09.650
and we're gonna have
to go ahead with this.

03:09.734 --> 03:11.652
If we're going
into holiday homes,

03:11.736 --> 03:13.780
then we're gonna need
the crofts with
a view of the loch

03:13.863 --> 03:15.782
and that means
Duncan's and yours.

03:15.865 --> 03:18.701
Archie, you're
throwing me out of my house.
Can we just get on with it?

03:18.785 --> 03:21.621
-If there was any other way...
-You've made your decision.

03:21.704 --> 03:23.247
You're the laird.

03:29.587 --> 03:32.131
Archie, watch it!

03:34.217 --> 03:36.051
Let's hope it's not an omen.

03:38.513 --> 03:40.139
It's her or me.

03:40.222 --> 03:42.350
I had no idea it was
going to be Isobel Hogg

03:42.433 --> 03:45.269
assessing us for the grant
until they phoned just now.

03:45.353 --> 03:47.021
Will you just listen?

03:47.105 --> 03:49.524
No! Not if it has
anything to do with
that ghastly woman.

03:49.606 --> 03:51.317
You chose her to
be my godmother.

03:51.401 --> 03:54.654
That was your father's idea.
Need I say more?

03:54.737 --> 03:56.364
Mother, please.

03:56.447 --> 03:59.867
You know that
she's an expert on
the survival of rare species.

03:59.951 --> 04:02.620
She made her name
studying animals
in their natural habitat.

04:02.704 --> 04:04.622
I feel very sorry
for the animals.

04:04.706 --> 04:07.458
And she's on the board
of Wildlife Scotland.

04:07.542 --> 04:10.003
They could give us a grant
that would
completely cover the cost

04:10.086 --> 04:12.839
for developing
the Wolf Centre.
It's a huge amount of money.

04:12.922 --> 04:15.383
-It depends on Isobel?
-Yes, that's what
I'm trying to tell you.

04:15.466 --> 04:17.760
Then you won't need me here.
I'm going to Kilwillie's.

04:17.844 --> 04:19.971
Mother,
I can't risk offending her.

04:20.053 --> 04:24.767
Oh, she'll think of something.
She'll go out of her way to
make life difficult for you.

04:27.645 --> 04:30.857
She's not the only
person round here
who's trying to do that.

04:45.371 --> 04:47.540
Here. I'll take that.

04:49.208 --> 04:50.918
Thanks.

04:51.002 --> 04:54.797
Oh, I'm okay. You know,
I'll manage. Excuse me.

05:02.096 --> 05:06.017
-Who's that?
-Esme. New cleaner.

05:07.143 --> 05:09.103
Oh,
thanks for letting me know.

05:09.187 --> 05:12.315
Like you told me about Irene?

05:12.398 --> 05:15.360
Look, I thought with
the opening and
visiting professors

05:15.443 --> 05:18.112
and all this moving
house stuff on your plate...

05:19.447 --> 05:21.366
Go on inside and see Golly.

05:31.167 --> 05:32.585
You all ready?

05:32.669 --> 05:37.882
Archie, I've lived 25
years in this house.

05:37.965 --> 05:41.803
I'm sorting something else
out for you. Gonna be a lot
better than this place.

05:41.886 --> 05:43.971
Very kind of you.

05:44.055 --> 05:47.600
But it doesn't change the way
I feel about what you've
done to this estate.

05:48.558 --> 05:50.353
You can't buy my approval.

05:50.436 --> 05:54.107
I'm not trying to do that.
We can't afford
to stand still.

05:54.190 --> 05:57.068
Standing still's
one thing, son.

05:57.151 --> 05:59.404
Running before you can
walk's quite another.

06:10.455 --> 06:12.875
ARCHIE: I used to come
up here when I was little.

06:12.959 --> 06:15.169
You know, just to get
away from the house.

06:16.421 --> 06:18.589
Golly was always
here to talk to.

06:20.008 --> 06:24.345
He was the one sane
person in my life.

06:24.429 --> 06:28.683
And now he keeps
telling me that
I'm getting it all wrong.

06:28.766 --> 06:32.145
And what about me?
Don't I count as sane?

06:33.438 --> 06:34.731
Borderline.

06:38.359 --> 06:40.653
Sorry I didn't
tell you about Esme.

06:40.737 --> 06:45.158
Mmm. It's not a great time
to be taking on extra staff.

06:45.241 --> 06:47.368
She does know that
it's not permanent?

06:47.452 --> 06:49.495
Yeah. I think she's
just a student.

06:49.579 --> 06:51.706
She just wanted a job
over the holidays.

06:51.789 --> 06:54.042
If you're worried about money,
it's not a problem.

06:54.125 --> 06:56.836
I'm paying her keep
and I'm giving
her cash in hand.

06:56.919 --> 07:00.505
You sure she's a student?
Seems very young.

07:00.590 --> 07:04.010
(LAUGHING) What,
to someone as old as you?

07:04.093 --> 07:05.636
Did you ask for references?

07:05.719 --> 07:08.890
-Archie...
-Okay, I'm sorry. Sorry.

07:08.973 --> 07:12.352
I'm sure it'll all be fine
once we get the centre open.

07:12.435 --> 07:16.856
I just feel like I'm breaking
a lot of eggs to make this
particular omelette.

07:16.939 --> 07:20.109
-I hope it's worth it.
-It will be.

07:20.193 --> 07:22.320
You know we're all
behind you, don't you?

07:22.403 --> 07:25.573
-Mmm.
-We are.

07:25.656 --> 07:28.951
Now, come on. 48 hours,
we've got a lot to do.

07:29.035 --> 07:31.120
Plus we've got
your fairy godmother.

07:31.204 --> 07:33.873
Isobel?
Oh, she won't be a problem.

07:33.956 --> 07:36.876
MAN: Ten reps.
Go for it. Push it!

07:36.959 --> 07:40.963
I can't! I can't go on!

07:41.047 --> 07:42.799
What's our target?

07:42.882 --> 07:45.677
-I told you.
-I want to hear again.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.470
To become a little trimmer.

07:48.554 --> 07:51.641
-To lose two stone.
-Yes.

07:51.724 --> 07:53.976
And why do we need to do this?

07:54.060 --> 07:57.522
-I can't see
the point of this.
-Motivation, that's the point.

07:57.605 --> 07:59.940
You're doing this for
a reason. What is it?

08:00.024 --> 08:04.028
There's a lady
of my acquaintance
who mentioned to me

08:04.111 --> 08:09.367
that she could
never be attracted
to someone who was portly.

08:09.450 --> 08:13.287
Okay, let's do some mat work.
On your hands and knees.

08:13.371 --> 08:14.997
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

08:15.081 --> 08:17.166
Kilwillie?

08:17.250 --> 08:19.293
-She can't find you here!
-Kilwillie?

08:19.377 --> 08:21.337
The fitness suite, you,
it's all
supposed to be a secret.

08:21.421 --> 08:23.756
-That was a condition
of your employment.
-I won't say a word.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.717
Shh! Over that way! Quick!

08:25.800 --> 08:28.344
-I'll take a shower.
-She'll hear you.

08:31.222 --> 08:33.140
Molly!

08:33.224 --> 08:35.143
(WHEEZING) What a surprise!

08:35.226 --> 08:39.063
-Are you quite all right?
-Oh, never better!

08:39.147 --> 08:42.442
I... I just got out of bed.

08:42.525 --> 08:44.318
I thought I heard
someone with you.

08:44.402 --> 08:47.196
No, definitely not.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.490
Left the shampoo in my room.

08:50.283 --> 08:51.825
Who's he?

08:52.785 --> 08:55.746
-Gavin.
-Gavin?

08:55.830 --> 08:58.206
My, er... My friend.

09:00.042 --> 09:03.796
-Is he staying with you?
-Yes.

09:03.880 --> 09:07.508
You know, a chap can get
awfully lonely in a big place
like this. It's...

09:07.592 --> 09:09.469
It's wonderful to
have a companion.

09:13.473 --> 09:14.974
Absolutely.

09:20.229 --> 09:22.815
I don't know why
Archie's put you in together.

09:22.899 --> 09:24.692
It's the only spare
room with heating.

09:24.776 --> 09:27.195
Anyway,
he says it's only gonna be
for a couple of nights.

09:27.278 --> 09:29.530
Well,
it still seems so unfair.

09:29.614 --> 09:33.659
Archie's a man in a hurry.
I'm not sure
fair comes into it.

09:33.743 --> 09:36.996
What you lads
need is a good woman
to look after you.

09:37.080 --> 09:40.291
-We've been looking.
-I'm only down the hall.

09:44.962 --> 09:47.882
That's the third
time she's been in.

09:47.965 --> 09:51.511
-She fancies you.
-Don't be daft.

10:01.354 --> 10:02.438
Hi.

10:04.941 --> 10:09.737
You making me feel guilty.
I used to just, you know,
hoover round the furniture.

10:09.821 --> 10:14.033
You should meet my mother,
then. House-proud or what?
I must have got it from her.

10:14.117 --> 10:17.829
Oh, you should meet mine.
That's why I'm here.
Running away from her.

10:20.373 --> 10:23.668
Well, not you, too?

10:23.751 --> 10:27.672
-What happened?
-I don't want
to talk about it.

10:27.755 --> 10:30.591
I just couldn't
stay there, that's all.

10:30.675 --> 10:32.552
Do you not have
any friends around
you could go to?

10:32.635 --> 10:34.303
I had to get right away.

10:34.387 --> 10:37.015
Well, you're all right here.

10:38.391 --> 10:41.227
Oh,
I gave Archie my references.

10:41.310 --> 10:43.896
-Your references?
-He asked me.

10:43.980 --> 10:46.065
Oh, did he?

10:46.149 --> 10:49.902
Right, well, don't be
too hard on those carpets.
They're not used to it.

10:52.572 --> 10:54.657
(RATTLING)

11:02.206 --> 11:04.208
I thought you'd
gone to Kilwillie's.

11:04.292 --> 11:09.380
I did, but I didn't want to
play gooseberry so I ended up
going to the library.

11:10.965 --> 11:14.260
-Why the sudden
interest in those books?
-Research.

11:14.344 --> 11:19.599
You know, I sometimes
feel that I've lived rather
a sheltered life.

11:19.682 --> 11:24.729
I mean,
there's so much to find out
about how the other half live.

11:24.812 --> 11:26.105
You've lost me.

11:26.189 --> 11:29.776
Never mind. I want to
ask you about Kilwillie.

11:29.859 --> 11:32.362
-Have you ever wondered...
-Wondered what?

11:32.445 --> 11:34.739
About him being a man's man?

11:34.822 --> 11:37.241
Mother,
I really haven't got a clue
what you're talking about.

11:37.325 --> 11:41.412
I'm pretty certain Kilwillie
is a friend of Dorothy's.

11:41.496 --> 11:46.876
-Dorothy, his sister?
-No, the other Dorothy.

11:46.959 --> 11:48.878
Well,
do I have to spell it out?

11:50.129 --> 11:52.090
He's batting for
the other side.

11:52.173 --> 11:54.676
I mean, all the clues
are there.
He went to Cambridge,

11:54.759 --> 11:56.636
like all those spies.

11:56.719 --> 12:01.432
His marriage was a disaster,
and now he's picked
up this petit ami.

12:02.308 --> 12:04.018
Need I say more?

12:04.102 --> 12:06.604
Mother, Kilwillie was one
of Father's best friends.

12:06.688 --> 12:10.149
No, dear.
They played golf together.
That is quite different.

12:15.154 --> 12:18.074
So, what's the nightlife
like in Glenbogle?

12:19.867 --> 12:21.786
Oh, there's loads going on.

12:21.869 --> 12:25.832
There's a... There's a ceilidh
in the school hall
nearly every month.

12:25.915 --> 12:28.167
Oh, and there was me thinking

12:28.251 --> 12:32.422
the only bright lights were
the ones that went red,
amber and green.

12:32.505 --> 12:34.465
I shall await my invitation.

12:42.056 --> 12:46.436
-What are you waiting for?
-She'll be here tomorrow,
Duncan.

12:46.519 --> 12:48.855
And the day after, I dare say.

12:52.650 --> 12:55.111
What happened to
the advert in the paper?

12:55.194 --> 12:59.407
I took the money in last week.
Said they'd put
it on page five.

13:01.242 --> 13:04.495
Well, it's not here.

13:04.579 --> 13:08.791
-Oh, I don't believe it.
-Sure you got the right week?

13:08.875 --> 13:12.795
Yes. The right week,
the right month,
the right year.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.589
The right paper.

13:14.672 --> 13:17.800
I think I could
manage all that.

13:17.884 --> 13:20.219
You really don't
trust me, do you?

13:20.303 --> 13:23.473
-Of course I do.
-And how about
Esme's references, eh?

13:23.556 --> 13:27.685
-Were they all up to scratch?
-They're okay as
far as I can see.

13:27.769 --> 13:32.023
-Just okay?
-No, they're glowing actually.

13:32.106 --> 13:36.069
If anything, they're too good.
Amazing grades in her Highers.

13:36.152 --> 13:38.571
I really can't understand
why she wants to work here.

13:38.654 --> 13:41.240
Oh, well, it's a job
for thickies like me, eh?

13:41.324 --> 13:43.910
Lexie, will you please
just give me a break?

13:43.993 --> 13:48.164
This isn't about you.
There's just...
There's something about Esme.

13:48.247 --> 13:49.916
What?

13:49.999 --> 13:53.670
-I'm not sure.
-You just don't
like it, do you?

13:53.753 --> 13:56.756
The fact that it was me
that hired her and not you.

13:56.839 --> 13:58.424
No.

13:58.508 --> 14:01.010
You know, this morning
I told Golly that
he had to trust you.

14:01.094 --> 14:05.640
How can he? I mean, how can
any of us if you don't do
the same to us?

14:05.723 --> 14:08.476
It's not a question of trust,
it's about
getting things done.

14:08.559 --> 14:11.062
The advertisement isn't there.

14:11.145 --> 14:14.148
-Okay, I'll call the paper.
-No.

14:15.316 --> 14:16.484
I'll do it.

14:23.241 --> 14:26.536
What do you think?
Atomic Kitten or Gail Porter?

14:26.619 --> 14:29.372
Are you not just a wee
bit too old for pin-ups?

14:29.455 --> 14:31.541
Time you moved on
to the real thing.

14:31.624 --> 14:35.128
Aye, well, next time
Gail drops in at Glenbogle.

14:35.211 --> 14:38.381
Oh, there are
other women, Duncan.
Proper women.

14:38.464 --> 14:42.093
-I quite like Esme.
-Then what's stopping you?

14:42.176 --> 14:45.013
Well, I still prefer Gail.

14:45.096 --> 14:46.889
Anyway, there's an age gap.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.392
And I work with her and
that can be difficult.

14:50.893 --> 14:52.729
-Good night, Duncan.
-Oh, good night.

14:52.812 --> 14:54.856
-Golly?
-Irene.

15:00.695 --> 15:02.822
She can't keep away from you.

15:02.905 --> 15:04.907
Maybe it's you she's after.

15:06.617 --> 15:09.078
I tell you what, though.
How about a double date?

15:10.163 --> 15:12.999
Me and Esme and you and Irene.

15:13.082 --> 15:14.792
No, I'm trying to read here.

15:30.391 --> 15:32.518
(HONKING HORN)

15:40.610 --> 15:41.861
Isobel!

15:44.864 --> 15:46.366
Are you Archie?

15:46.449 --> 15:48.576
Yes. I think I was in London
the last time you were here,

15:48.659 --> 15:50.703
and I must have been
about 10 when we last met.

15:50.787 --> 15:54.374
Oh. MacDonald men
never have aged well.

15:54.457 --> 15:57.710
-No problem my
pitching up early?
-No, no, not at all.

15:57.794 --> 16:00.129
I thought when you said 9:00,
you meant 9:00 tonight, but...

16:00.213 --> 16:03.299
I did, but I changed my mind.

16:03.383 --> 16:04.884
This is for you.

16:07.553 --> 16:09.305
Damn good thing I
knew my way here.

16:09.389 --> 16:11.933
You won't get many visitors
if you can't find
the ruddy place.

16:12.016 --> 16:15.687
No. Well,
it's good to see you, Isobel.

16:15.770 --> 16:18.648
I've prepared a presentation
about our plans
for the centre.

16:18.731 --> 16:20.900
Oh, plans, huh?

16:20.983 --> 16:24.904
Well, plans are all very well,
but my beef is to see if this
thing actually works or not.

16:24.987 --> 16:28.533
To be blunt, several of the
trustees think you haven't got
a cat in hell's chance

16:28.616 --> 16:30.284
of attracting enough visitors.

16:30.368 --> 16:32.203
But I shall be able
to judge that tomorrow.

16:33.538 --> 16:34.706
(DOGS BARKING)

16:34.789 --> 16:37.792
Good morning, Isobel.
How lovely to see you.

16:37.875 --> 16:39.585
Don't be silly,
you can't stand
the sight of me.

16:39.669 --> 16:41.212
Hector made that quite
clear years ago.

16:41.295 --> 16:43.256
I wouldn't put it
quite that strongly.

16:43.339 --> 16:47.844
-So, how are you
enjoying being a merry widow?
-I beg your pardon?

16:47.927 --> 16:50.680
I assume you've been
lining up the next victim.

16:50.763 --> 16:55.309
Or maybe he was there before
Hector had that odd accident.

16:58.187 --> 17:00.690
May I introduce
my fiancee, Lexie?

17:00.773 --> 17:03.192
Erm,
pleased to meet you, Isobel.

17:03.276 --> 17:06.738
That's Professor Hogg
until you tie the knot.

17:06.820 --> 17:10.742
You look remarkably like
that girl who used to work
in the kitchen.

17:10.825 --> 17:14.454
Well, that's because I am.

17:14.537 --> 17:19.459
Oh. Well, I suppose
it's traditional for lairds at
Glenbogle to lose their heads

17:19.541 --> 17:21.461
when it comes to
choosing a wife.

17:21.544 --> 17:25.673
Archie is the exception
that proves the rule.
He's made a wonderful choice.

17:25.757 --> 17:27.633
May I show you to your room?

17:38.519 --> 17:39.604
Hi.

17:39.687 --> 17:42.357
-Hi.
-This one made a run for it.

17:42.440 --> 17:43.733
Thanks.

17:47.904 --> 17:51.407
-Is it true you feed
rabbits to the wolves?
-Yep.

17:51.491 --> 17:54.952
Archie couldn't
find any wolves
that were vegetarian.

17:56.245 --> 17:57.789
That's a joke.

17:57.871 --> 18:00.541
The meat comes
frozen in plastic bags.

18:00.625 --> 18:02.710
Sounds like you prefer
to feed them live rabbits.

18:02.793 --> 18:04.962
I prefer not to
have them here at all.

18:05.046 --> 18:07.255
-Why?
-I'm a gillie,
not a zookeeper.

18:09.175 --> 18:10.635
Here.

18:12.428 --> 18:15.765
-You know about animals, then?
-A bit.

18:15.848 --> 18:19.143
Working in a place like this,
you can't get too
sentimental about them.

18:19.227 --> 18:21.020
I'm not.

18:21.104 --> 18:23.773
Just that sometimes I
prefer them to people.

18:24.857 --> 18:27.985
Me, too. Sometimes.

18:32.407 --> 18:36.369
-So, how are you settling in?
-Okay.

18:36.452 --> 18:39.914
-It has its advantages.
-You're closer to me?

18:40.873 --> 18:44.585
-What's wrong?
-Golly.

18:44.669 --> 18:49.465
He's like a fish out of
water that's sick as a parrot.
And it's getting to me.

18:49.549 --> 18:52.051
What about an evening out?
Would that help?

18:52.135 --> 18:55.263
-Yeah.
Yeah, that's a great idea.
-Tonight?

18:55.346 --> 18:57.682
-Yeah, I'll tell Golly.
-Why?

18:58.933 --> 19:02.395
Well,
he'll need to know, won't he?

19:08.484 --> 19:10.361
What are you doing tonight?

19:10.445 --> 19:13.281
You mean after I've thrown
your computer
game in the loch?

19:13.364 --> 19:17.243
-Does that keep you awake?
-No, you playing on
it keeps me awake.

19:17.326 --> 19:19.620
Sorry. Look...

19:21.205 --> 19:23.541
how would you
like to go on a date?

19:23.624 --> 19:26.044
Well, sharing a room
with you is one thing, son.

19:26.127 --> 19:32.467
With Irene.
She's sort of asked me
to ask you for a date.

19:32.550 --> 19:38.097
Look, Duncan, if I want
to ask Irene for a date,
I'll talk to her myself.

19:38.181 --> 19:41.059
-You can do that on the date,
can't you?
-What?

19:41.142 --> 19:43.561
Forgot to ask her a time!

19:43.644 --> 19:44.896
Duncan.

19:46.647 --> 19:48.107
You're on.

19:48.191 --> 19:51.069
The date tonight.
When do you want to meet?

19:51.152 --> 19:53.363
-Up to you.
-And Golly.

19:53.446 --> 19:55.490
Do you have to check
everything with him?

19:55.573 --> 19:59.118
No. Um,
why don't we meet here?

19:59.202 --> 20:01.329
-I'll be ready at 6:00.
-Great.

20:06.542 --> 20:08.378
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

20:11.422 --> 20:13.716
Do you look after the birds?

20:13.800 --> 20:16.386
My reputation's
gone before me.

20:16.469 --> 20:19.597
-I mean, the sea eagle.
-Aye, I do.

20:21.599 --> 20:24.936
-Would you like to see her?
-Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

20:25.019 --> 20:27.355
How about tonight after work?

20:27.438 --> 20:29.107
I'll have to check my diary.

20:30.817 --> 20:32.485
But I think
it'll be all right.

20:35.947 --> 20:38.574
Oh, Molly! What a surprise!

20:38.658 --> 20:41.035
-I just had to get
out of the house.
-Why?

20:41.119 --> 20:44.288
Archie's godmother.
But let's not talk about it.

20:44.372 --> 20:45.790
I know your secret.

20:46.916 --> 20:48.793
Oh, you mean my gym.

20:48.876 --> 20:50.837
I thought his name was Gavin.

20:50.920 --> 20:54.132
No, the gymnasium
where Gavin and I work out.

20:54.215 --> 20:55.925
I'd rather not
know the details.

20:56.009 --> 20:58.011
Well,
you can join us if you like.

20:58.094 --> 21:01.973
-I don't think so.
-Oh, come on. Have a go.

21:02.056 --> 21:03.516
Made me feel like a new man.

21:03.599 --> 21:06.686
-And that's
where Gavin came in.
-Got it in one.

21:10.231 --> 21:11.983
-Hi.
-Hi.

21:12.066 --> 21:14.986
-How'd you get in here?
-Lexie gave me her keys.

21:15.069 --> 21:17.405
Do you not want me
to clean in here?

21:17.488 --> 21:20.158
I've got a couple of
calls to make, so later maybe.

21:20.241 --> 21:21.242
Sure.

21:39.969 --> 21:41.929
(MOLLY EXCLAIMING)

21:42.013 --> 21:43.890
This is the pecs machine.

21:43.973 --> 21:46.434
-Like in the song?
-If you say so.

21:46.517 --> 21:49.979
-Do you want to
try the runner?
-Er, no.

21:50.063 --> 21:52.565
Kilwillie,
what do you need this for?

21:52.648 --> 21:55.151
There must be
at least 40 miles
of private road on the estate,

21:55.234 --> 21:57.612
and goodness knows
how many footpaths.

21:57.695 --> 21:59.614
Good point.
We could go out for a jog.

21:59.697 --> 22:03.785
-That'd be fun. Do you
want to come, Kilwillie?
-Jogging outside? Are you mad?

22:03.868 --> 22:07.455
I'll tell you what, Lord K,
you keep going in
here and we'll step out.

22:07.538 --> 22:11.125
Let's put you up
to 90 revs, 2K.

22:11.209 --> 22:15.088
-And then
the whole circuit again.
-What are you talking about?

22:16.172 --> 22:17.674
Oh!

22:20.927 --> 22:24.514
Yes, but
the centre's opening tomorrow
and I'm expecting visitors.

22:25.431 --> 22:27.225
No, next week's too late.

22:29.018 --> 22:30.395
Okay, thank you.

22:31.646 --> 22:33.147
What is it?

22:33.231 --> 22:37.193
Apparently it's my fault that
15 signs have been vandalised.

22:37.276 --> 22:39.404
Have you checked
the petty cash?

22:39.487 --> 22:42.198
-Er, yeah.
-Does it balance?

22:42.281 --> 22:46.285
No, actually.
There's £50 missing.

22:46.369 --> 22:49.122
-But,
I mean, that's probably me.
-Esme was in here on her own,

22:49.205 --> 22:51.833
and the safe door was open.
She had a set of keys.

22:51.916 --> 22:53.543
Yeah, I gave her mine.

22:54.794 --> 22:57.714
Lex, you gave her
the keys to the safe.

22:57.797 --> 23:01.009
This is a girl we know nothing
about. She turned up
here out of the blue.

23:01.092 --> 23:04.554
Yeah, like I did.
Didn't make me a thief.

23:04.637 --> 23:07.265
-This is not about you.
-Right, okay, okay.

23:07.348 --> 23:09.225
Let's go and ask
her then, shall we?

23:09.308 --> 23:12.228
Or do you just
want to go straight to
the National Crime Squad?

23:15.189 --> 23:18.067
(CLEARING THROAT) Esme.

23:18.151 --> 23:21.320
There's some money
missing from the safe.

23:21.404 --> 23:22.989
I'm sorry?

23:23.072 --> 23:25.658
And the Laird here
thinks that you took it.

23:25.742 --> 23:29.787
-I didn't say that.
-Then why are we here?

23:29.871 --> 23:34.459
You were in the office,
the safe door was open
and we're missing £50.

23:34.542 --> 23:37.837
-The safe was open
when I went in there.
-I don't think so.

23:37.920 --> 23:41.215
Well, I could have left
it open. You know,
I don't always check.

23:41.299 --> 23:45.053
-We're still missing £50.
-Well, it wasn't me.
You can check my room.

23:45.136 --> 23:48.681
-Okay,
I want to clear this up.
-No, there's no need.

23:48.765 --> 23:50.558
We'll take your word for it.

23:58.816 --> 24:00.234
I'm sorry.

24:10.078 --> 24:12.080
So,
how did you meet Kilwillie?

24:12.163 --> 24:16.167
-Put an advertisement
in a magazine.
-Oh, that is so brave.

24:18.711 --> 24:21.130
I was beginning to
think you'd been waylaid.

24:21.214 --> 24:24.092
Oh, no. Gavin's been
telling me all about himself.

24:24.175 --> 24:28.304
Absolutely fascinating,
all that stuff about
being a footballer.

24:28.388 --> 24:32.600
He's told me one or two
things about you, too.
What a dark horse you are.

24:32.684 --> 24:35.561
-Am I?
-A positive black beauty.

24:35.645 --> 24:40.942
Anyway, I think it's lovely.
In fact, I think I'm
a little bit jealous.

24:41.025 --> 24:44.362
Oh, I could
probably lend him to you
for the odd day.

24:44.445 --> 24:48.366
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)
Lend him? I don't see
how that could work.

24:48.449 --> 24:50.702
Anyway,
what would Gavin think?

24:50.785 --> 24:53.746
Beautiful lady like you?
I'd be delighted.

24:56.791 --> 25:00.420
Why don't you come
to supper tonight?
Both of you?

25:00.503 --> 25:01.921
What, Gavin?

25:02.005 --> 25:05.466
Of course!
Oh, we're ever so modern
at Glenbogle these days.

25:06.843 --> 25:08.594
Oh, thank you.

25:11.514 --> 25:12.515
Golly?

25:56.517 --> 26:00.188
The wildlife trails
and the bike paths
already attract visitors

26:00.271 --> 26:03.358
and we're hoping
that the interest
generated by the Wolf Centre

26:03.441 --> 26:06.944
will more than
double this figure
within the first three months.

26:07.028 --> 26:10.156
So if we take
the number of visitors
you have tomorrow,

26:10.239 --> 26:12.867
that'll be an accurate guide
to how many you'll have
in three months' time?

26:12.950 --> 26:15.578
Well, tomorrow
might not be typical.

26:15.661 --> 26:18.998
Yeah, but tomorrow is
the day I'll be here.

26:19.082 --> 26:21.709
Well, I'd say if you've done
your job adequately,

26:21.793 --> 26:23.836
you should have
visitors rolling in.

26:23.920 --> 26:27.674
Well, there may be teething
problems, but I'm sure you'll
take that into account.

26:27.757 --> 26:32.261
I hope you're not expecting
any special favours just
because I'm your godmother.

26:32.345 --> 26:35.807
If we're going to pour
money into this Wolf Centre,

26:35.890 --> 26:38.768
I have to be certain
that it will make a profit

26:38.851 --> 26:41.437
and that it will
be run competently.

26:41.521 --> 26:43.398
It will be.

26:43.481 --> 26:45.149
We'll see, won't we?

26:52.323 --> 26:56.202
-So you're off to
see Esme, are you?
-Aye.

26:56.285 --> 26:57.954
Where are you going?

26:58.037 --> 27:01.374
Off to look at the sea eagle.
And then after that,
I don't know.

27:01.457 --> 27:03.835
It may be a good idea
to think of somewhere

27:03.918 --> 27:06.671
before you put the rest of
that bottle of
perfume on your face.

27:08.673 --> 27:10.341
Oh, okay.

27:28.943 --> 27:30.945
-Hi.
-Are you ready?

27:31.696 --> 27:33.031
Me?

27:33.114 --> 27:35.825
-Yeah.
-Shall we go?

27:35.908 --> 27:39.120
-Where?
-We're going out, aren't we?

27:39.203 --> 27:43.666
-Us?
-That was the general idea.
So...

27:43.750 --> 27:49.672
But you're you
and I'm, you know.

27:51.424 --> 27:55.386
Am I being really stupid
or did we make
a date this morning?

27:55.470 --> 27:57.847
Yes. I mean...

27:59.349 --> 28:03.269
-I was really
looking forward to it.
-Really?

28:07.607 --> 28:08.733
Me, too.

28:11.819 --> 28:13.696
So, shall we go?

28:16.032 --> 28:18.201
Just give me two minutes.

28:23.539 --> 28:24.791
Golly!

28:28.670 --> 28:31.130
-Have you seen Golly?
-No. Are you ready?

28:31.214 --> 28:34.217
Yeah. Oh, no!
Look, about the sea eagle,
can it wait?

28:34.300 --> 28:36.636
-I thought you said tonight.
-I know,
but I've got an emergency.

28:36.719 --> 28:38.721
Not a bad emergency,
a good emergency.

28:38.805 --> 28:40.807
IRENE: Duncan,
what are you doing?

28:40.890 --> 28:43.976
Look, I'm sorry,
I'll show you tomorrow.
And the capercaillie.

28:44.060 --> 28:46.979
Sorry, oh, and if you
see Golly, can you say...

28:47.063 --> 28:49.232
No, if you see Golly,
don't say anything.

29:19.762 --> 29:22.515
So, what do you want to do?

29:22.598 --> 29:24.809
I thought the idea was
you'd show me around.

29:26.144 --> 29:29.063
Well, there's the...

29:29.147 --> 29:32.442
-There's the pub.
-I've been to the pub.
Once was enough.

29:32.525 --> 29:35.236
Okay. Well, there's the...

29:35.903 --> 29:37.989
erm, cinema.

29:38.072 --> 29:41.868
-There isn't a cinema.
-That's where you're wrong.

29:41.951 --> 29:43.536
It's just got here.

29:51.544 --> 29:55.298
Tell me,
how did this connection
with wildlife come about?

29:55.381 --> 29:57.175
It's all in my book.

29:57.258 --> 30:00.386
-You've written a book?
-I've written 14 books.

30:00.470 --> 30:04.766
My autobiography,
Isobel Hogg, A Remarkable
Life, is one of them.

30:04.849 --> 30:06.267
Molly has a copy.

30:06.351 --> 30:09.062
I must get round to
reading it one day.

30:11.147 --> 30:16.569
If you look in the index under
"Alaska,
the first expedition, 1959",

30:16.652 --> 30:21.032
you'll find my ground-breaking
research on wolves fully
dealt with there.

30:22.658 --> 30:23.951
Fascinating.

30:25.661 --> 30:28.206
Everything ready for
the great day tomorrow,
Archie?

30:28.289 --> 30:30.792
Well, I thought it was,

30:30.875 --> 30:35.213
but it seems that somebody
has been trying
to sabotage us.

30:35.296 --> 30:40.176
Someone has
cancelled our advertising
and vandalised our signs.

30:40.259 --> 30:42.136
Who on earth would do that?

30:42.220 --> 30:45.390
I wonder if Isobel might know.

30:45.473 --> 30:48.518
-I beg your pardon?
-I know your secret.

30:50.812 --> 30:53.272
I saw the signs in
the back of your car.

30:56.025 --> 30:58.820
Molly, as usual,
you're talking through

30:58.903 --> 31:01.155
the well-padded seat
of your chair.

31:01.239 --> 31:05.660
I saw the vandalised signs.
I collected them for Archie.
He knows all about them.

31:05.743 --> 31:08.413
And you had nothing
to do with damaging
them in the first place?

31:08.496 --> 31:11.958
-Mother.
-Would I have
told Archie if I had?

31:12.041 --> 31:15.545
-Classic double bluff.
-Classic tosh.

31:16.629 --> 31:18.881
Or should I say vintage Molly?

31:21.009 --> 31:23.219
I'll take
the coffee in my room.

31:24.929 --> 31:28.307
I have some Wildlife
Scotland work to catch up on.

31:30.101 --> 31:34.939
Thank you, Mother.
That's made sure we
won't get the grant.

31:35.023 --> 31:39.777
And in case you're interested,
it wasn't Isobel who
vandalised the signs.

31:39.861 --> 31:42.655
I think it was
someone much closer to home.

32:07.347 --> 32:09.223
I was in your
workshop earlier.

32:10.808 --> 32:12.977
Found a can of spray paint.

32:14.437 --> 32:17.690
Same sort that has been
used on the road signs.

32:17.774 --> 32:20.985
Do you think I've
painted over them?

32:21.069 --> 32:24.739
-I didn't say that.
-Well, you did think it,
though, didn't you?

32:24.822 --> 32:28.993
The thought had
crossed my mind.

32:29.077 --> 32:33.623
You've been telling anyone
who'll listen how much you
disapprove of the Wolf Centre.

32:33.706 --> 32:38.544
You're dead-set against
everything that I've tried to
do to change the estate.

32:38.628 --> 32:40.546
Why not take it
one step further?

32:40.630 --> 32:44.884
-You know me better than that.
-I thought I did.

32:44.967 --> 32:47.720
Look, Archie, you've
evicted me from my home.

32:47.804 --> 32:51.724
You've taken away
a whole part of the job
I live for.

32:51.808 --> 32:53.935
I've every reason to be angry.

32:55.812 --> 32:59.107
But I will stick by you.
Right or wrong.

33:01.818 --> 33:05.571
And you've made it
pretty clear that it's wrong.

33:05.655 --> 33:09.742
This place has
to change, Golly,
whether you like it or not.

33:09.826 --> 33:11.244
Well, if you go
on at this rate,

33:11.327 --> 33:13.663
you'll be the only one here
to see how it turns out.

33:15.206 --> 33:17.834
Hector wouldn't
have done it like this.

33:22.005 --> 33:23.881
I'm not my father.

33:38.438 --> 33:40.690
Did you see how she reacted
when you said you
knew her secret?

33:40.773 --> 33:43.109
It's as if she'd been
kicked by a polo pony.

33:43.192 --> 33:45.611
You think she
does have a secret?

33:45.695 --> 33:49.032
-Don't we all?
-I wish I'd asked Hector.

33:49.115 --> 33:52.368
Molly,
I have a secret of my own.

33:53.745 --> 33:57.832
-Gavin.
-I know.
It wasn't hard to guess.

33:57.915 --> 34:00.335
I had my reason for
taking on a personal trainer.

34:00.418 --> 34:04.130
'Cause Gavin wanted one?
I suppose he
needs to keep fit.

34:04.213 --> 34:07.300
No,
Gavin is my personal trainer.

34:07.383 --> 34:10.261
I'm a little
embarrassed about it.

34:10.344 --> 34:12.054
Gavin is your
personal trainer?

34:12.138 --> 34:13.889
-Mmm.
-Oh.

34:13.973 --> 34:15.641
So you're not gay?

34:15.725 --> 34:17.893
I'm pretty merry
after that Saint-Emilion.

34:19.353 --> 34:21.147
Good grief!

34:21.230 --> 34:23.815
-Did you think I
was a nancy boy?
-Oh, no, no.

34:23.900 --> 34:28.029
That's outrageous!
I am 110% heterosexual.

34:28.112 --> 34:30.572
A great admirer
of the fairer sex,

34:30.656 --> 34:33.784
and one delightful member
of it in particular.

34:33.868 --> 34:37.955
In fact, Molly, since
we're talking about secrets,

34:38.039 --> 34:40.958
I have another one
concerning you and me.

34:41.042 --> 34:44.003
Of course,
it was just like you and me.

34:44.087 --> 34:47.840
I thought I knew your secret,
but I got the wrong secret.

34:47.924 --> 34:49.801
I've done
the same with Isobel.

34:49.884 --> 34:52.136
The road signs
weren't her secret.
It was something else.

34:52.219 --> 34:54.847
The reason she keeps
coming back here.

34:54.931 --> 34:56.474
Yes, but we have no idea
what that is.

34:56.556 --> 34:59.977
What were we talking about?
1959.

35:00.061 --> 35:04.065
That was
the year I met Hector.
Isobel was in Alaska.

35:04.148 --> 35:07.819
The funny thing is,
Hector would never
talk about that time.

35:07.902 --> 35:09.904
Well, then we're stymied.

35:09.987 --> 35:12.240
There might be
something in Isobel's book.

35:12.323 --> 35:14.867
Yes, but... Molly!

35:17.286 --> 35:18.329
Oh.

35:43.813 --> 35:45.230
Arch.

35:47.358 --> 35:48.358
Come on.

35:56.868 --> 35:59.996
Oh, I've got to go and check
the wolves before I go to bed.

36:00.079 --> 36:03.249
-Keep the wolf
from the door, eh?
-No, they don't have a door.

36:03.332 --> 36:05.126
It's like
a hole in the ground.

36:06.210 --> 36:07.920
Do you want a hand?

36:08.004 --> 36:10.506
-No,
it's kind of muddy up there.
-I don't mind.

36:10.590 --> 36:13.593
-Where do they sleep?
-In a den.

36:13.676 --> 36:17.554
Well, the mother
will be under the ground
with a cub just now.

36:17.638 --> 36:22.060
But the really interesting
thing is the father wolf
goes out to eat

36:22.142 --> 36:24.187
and then he comes back
to the burrow

36:24.270 --> 36:27.565
and regurgitates the food
so that they can have some.

36:27.648 --> 36:30.985
-That's so romantic.
-Is it?

36:31.069 --> 36:34.072
You, me, moonlight,
and the smell of wolf vomit.

36:34.155 --> 36:36.366
What more could a girl want?

36:39.744 --> 36:43.539
-What are you thinking about?
-I forgot to feed the rabbits.

36:46.584 --> 36:48.211
Good night, Duncan.

37:08.356 --> 37:11.693
-Sorry, did I wake you?
-Where have you been?

37:12.443 --> 37:15.029
Out. At my Auntie Liz's.

37:15.113 --> 37:19.534
-Emergency. Plumbing thing.
-Right.

37:21.202 --> 37:25.164
-How was your evening?
-I didn't have one.

38:01.409 --> 38:03.369
Good morning, Isobel.
I hope you slept well.

38:03.453 --> 38:07.540
No, I was up all night
sabotaging Archie's zoo.

38:07.623 --> 38:12.420
Archie told me I have
to apologise to you.
I am very sorry.

38:12.503 --> 38:17.467
And as my penance
I'm reading your book.

38:17.550 --> 38:22.347
Here's Hector's bookmark.
Got all the way
to...page five.

38:38.905 --> 38:41.532
-It's our first customer!
-You know what to do.

38:47.538 --> 38:50.708
-Oh, dear.
-What? It's still very early.

38:50.792 --> 38:52.543
And very empty.

38:54.337 --> 38:56.673
Look, I know my
mother handled it badly,

38:56.756 --> 38:59.676
but we have had a few problems
with the signs
and the adverts,

38:59.759 --> 39:01.594
but they're
starting to arrive.

39:05.098 --> 39:07.684
You haven't had
one single visitor.

39:09.018 --> 39:11.604
There really isn't
much more to say.

39:17.151 --> 39:18.444
What happened?

39:21.197 --> 39:22.907
She wanted a garage.

39:24.075 --> 39:25.743
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

39:25.827 --> 39:28.454
Hello?

39:28.538 --> 39:31.332
Esme,
hi, could you give me a hand
down at the visitors' centre?

39:31.416 --> 39:34.669
-The girl that works there,
she never turned up.
-Yeah. No problem.

39:34.752 --> 39:38.506
-You're not leaving, are you?
-No, I'm just tidying up.

39:38.589 --> 39:40.925
There is
something I wanted to say.

39:41.009 --> 39:44.095
I know since you've been here
everybody's been
a wee bit on edge,

39:44.178 --> 39:46.889
what with the opening
and everything else.

39:46.973 --> 39:49.142
But, you know,
it's not always like this.

39:49.225 --> 39:51.269
-It's quite good really.
-Yeah.

39:51.352 --> 39:54.397
I mean, it worked out for me.
Look, I came here as the cook

39:54.480 --> 39:56.774
and now I'm going to
be marrying the laird.

39:56.858 --> 39:59.610
-Don't you get any
ideas though, eh?
-As if.

40:00.903 --> 40:03.573
-Are you really
marrying Archie?
-Yeah, yeah.

40:05.199 --> 40:07.744
-What, did you not know?
-No.

40:07.827 --> 40:11.080
It's just
the way he treats you.
Maybe you're used to it.

40:11.164 --> 40:13.750
-Me and Archie
get on just fine.
-Okay.

40:13.833 --> 40:17.754
-What made you think that?
-Maybe it's just
since I've been here.

40:17.837 --> 40:20.381
I suppose things
have been different
since you've been here.

40:20.465 --> 40:22.759
Look, I'll get you
at the visitors' centre.

40:22.842 --> 40:24.177
There's something
I need to do.

40:33.186 --> 40:37.940
-How's it going?
-Well, we could
squeeze in one or two more.

40:38.024 --> 40:41.486
-Where's Isobel?
-She's writing her
report for Wildlife Scotland.

40:41.569 --> 40:44.447
Ah, so we've lost the grant.
Great.

40:50.453 --> 40:54.040
-Well, at least we
have one customer.
-Morning!

40:56.417 --> 40:58.961
(MUMBLING) £5 entry, please.

40:59.045 --> 41:02.965
We also have
illustrated guides.

41:03.049 --> 41:06.761
-And maps of
the wildlife trails.
-I beg your pardon?

41:06.844 --> 41:09.555
-Sorry, are you a concession?
-A what?

41:09.639 --> 41:15.019
Under 16?
An old age... Unemployed.

41:15.103 --> 41:18.356
Duncan, don't be so silly.
Kilwillie's my guest.

41:18.439 --> 41:21.150
Kilwillie,
I wonder if you could help me
with something in the house.

41:21.234 --> 41:22.985
At your service.

41:33.955 --> 41:38.209
-Can I have a go on
the bouncy castle?
-No, you stay here.

41:38.292 --> 41:40.878
I'll try and drum
up some business.

42:01.983 --> 42:05.695
-Gavin and I have had
a parting of the ways.
-Oh, no. Why?

42:05.778 --> 42:07.780
On mature reflection,

42:07.864 --> 42:10.533
I came to see that a chap can
get all the exercise he
needs on the golf course.

42:10.616 --> 42:12.744
Gavin was rather
surplus to requirements.

42:12.827 --> 42:17.081
Mind you, if you ever need
a jogging partner,
look no further.

42:17.165 --> 42:19.917
You'll be at
the top of my list.

42:20.001 --> 42:23.463
-What exactly are we doing?
-Digging up Hector's past.

42:23.546 --> 42:27.759
I want to know exactly what
he and Isobel
were up to in 1959.

42:27.842 --> 42:31.763
-That's rather
a tall order, isn't it?
-Hector always kept a diary.

42:31.846 --> 42:36.601
I think there must be some
clue to Isobel's secret
somewhere here.

42:40.188 --> 42:41.522
Ah.

42:43.232 --> 42:45.193
Ah.

42:45.276 --> 42:49.072
Well, I don't know who told
you that. We most
definitely are open today.

42:49.155 --> 42:52.075
Well, maybe another time.
Okay.

42:54.660 --> 42:58.081
Somebody has
phoned all the schools
and told them we're closed.

42:58.164 --> 43:01.542
It's Esme.
I found these in her bag.

43:49.799 --> 43:53.052
-It must be the generator.
-The electric fence.

43:53.136 --> 43:54.429
BOTH: The wolves!

43:56.931 --> 44:00.268
-Get away from there!
Get away!
-No, I'm letting them out.

44:00.351 --> 44:03.062
-I'll just have to shoot them.
-That'll look
great in the papers.

44:03.146 --> 44:05.940
-Then this place
will never open.
-Give me those!

44:06.024 --> 44:08.818
Why are you doing this
after what
Archie's done to you?

44:08.901 --> 44:11.612
-What are you talking about?
-Being chucked
out of your house.

44:11.696 --> 44:13.656
That is none of your business.

44:13.740 --> 44:15.408
Why don't you just leave,
get a life?

44:15.491 --> 44:17.702
I've got a life. You just
stand there and shut up!

44:17.785 --> 44:19.287
ARCHIE: Esme!

44:23.750 --> 44:25.335
-Did any escape?
-Only her.

44:25.418 --> 44:27.628
-Can you get that patched up?
-Yeah, no problem.

44:27.712 --> 44:29.047
Esme!

44:31.591 --> 44:35.845
-Isobel, Kilwillie and I
have a question for you.
-This isn't a good moment.

44:35.928 --> 44:37.430
This power cut has crashed
my computer

44:37.513 --> 44:39.932
and I've lost my whole report
for Wildlife Scotland.

44:40.016 --> 44:43.936
-It won't take a moment.
It's about your book.
-Which one?

44:44.020 --> 44:46.939
Isobel Hogg:
A Remarkable Life.

44:47.023 --> 44:51.194
We think it should be
Isobel Hogg: A Remarkable Lie.

44:51.861 --> 44:53.404
ARCHIE: Esme!

45:07.502 --> 45:09.128
Isn't that your car?

45:14.509 --> 45:16.427
Don't worry about
losing your car,

45:16.511 --> 45:18.721
you're about to lose
your reputation.

45:18.805 --> 45:21.766
Alaska, 1959.

45:21.849 --> 45:25.937
The adventure that got
you in all the papers
and made you so very famous.

45:26.020 --> 45:30.066
You were all alone
in the frozen north
for a whole year?

45:30.149 --> 45:32.694
Except you weren't.
You were here!

45:32.777 --> 45:37.240
Canoodling with Hector!
It's all here, in his diary.

45:37.323 --> 45:41.911
-That doesn't prove a thing.
-You also signed
the visitors' book.

45:46.124 --> 45:51.337
-Hector swore he'd never tell.
-He didn't, but I might.

46:38.343 --> 46:41.471
-Come on.
-Get off me. Get off me!

46:41.554 --> 46:43.431
I'm on the same
side as you are.

46:43.514 --> 46:45.933
-The whole Wolf Centre
is about conservation.
-It's a zoo!

46:46.017 --> 46:49.312
It's a zoo with a point!
Do you know
anything about wolves?

46:49.395 --> 46:51.064
A lot more than you do.

46:51.147 --> 46:53.733
Then you'll know the red wolf
was completely
extinct in the wild.

46:53.816 --> 46:56.986
It needed
protection in captivity
before it could get put back.

46:57.070 --> 46:58.112
That's what we're
trying to do.

46:58.196 --> 46:59.572
But I know about zoos as well.

46:59.655 --> 47:01.449
They go on about how
they're into conservation,

47:01.532 --> 47:04.702
but what they really do
is inflate their owner's egos.

47:04.786 --> 47:06.662
Get off!

47:06.746 --> 47:08.247
Come on.

47:12.377 --> 47:15.546
Oh, look, you know what?
That's our first visitors.

47:16.964 --> 47:18.800
But the ticket
machine's not working.

47:18.883 --> 47:21.135
The kids get in free.
And they get an ice cream.

47:21.219 --> 47:24.847
-You're kidding.
-Well,
the freezer's not working.

47:24.931 --> 47:27.892
What else are gonna do
with 500 warm Magnums?

47:32.563 --> 47:36.109
I don't like
seeing them caged up
any more than you do.

47:36.192 --> 47:39.654
One day maybe they'll be
free to walk the hills.

47:39.737 --> 47:41.948
What we've got going
here is not perfect,

47:42.031 --> 47:45.243
but it's a step
in the right direction,
isn't it?

47:45.326 --> 47:49.706
-Maybe.
-Why did you
pick on Glenbogle?

47:49.789 --> 47:53.001
I read something
Professor Hogg wrote
in the paper about it.

47:54.335 --> 47:56.629
She said how you
were opening this zoo.

47:56.713 --> 47:59.799
Did you really run away
from home or were you lying
about that, too?

47:59.882 --> 48:04.012
No. I had a row with my dad.

48:06.139 --> 48:10.018
I can never do anything right.
Nothing's ever
good enough, you know?

48:13.354 --> 48:15.523
I didn't steal that money.
I promise.

48:15.606 --> 48:20.194
I don't care about the money.
You hurt Lexie.
You let her down.

48:20.278 --> 48:21.988
I'm sorry.

48:40.048 --> 48:42.175
I hope you're
pleased with yourself.

48:42.258 --> 48:44.761
-Did you call the police?
-Yeah, they're on their way.

48:44.844 --> 48:47.722
Tell them not to bother.

48:47.805 --> 48:51.059
Go and get your bags.
Duncan will drive
you to the station.

48:51.142 --> 48:54.228
-I don't understand.
-Quick,
before I change my mind.

48:56.814 --> 49:00.360
-What's going on?
-She's a kid.
She made a mistake.

49:00.443 --> 49:03.321
What about the money she took?
That's just thieving.

49:03.404 --> 49:05.740
Well, I'd like to
give her another chance.

49:05.823 --> 49:10.286
-That's what Glenbogle
did for you, isn't it?
-Yeah.

49:11.204 --> 49:13.206
And maybe she's a bit like me.

49:14.540 --> 49:16.542
A bad case of tunnel vision.

49:16.626 --> 49:20.296
Don't blame yourself.
You were right
about her all along.

49:21.214 --> 49:22.674
Come here.

49:27.720 --> 49:32.183
Archie MacDonald, I'm
glad that I'm marrying you.

49:32.266 --> 49:35.895
-Are you sure?
-Mmm. Most days.

49:35.978 --> 49:38.940
-And you?
-Oh, yes.

49:40.525 --> 49:42.235
But you might want
to concentrate on the

49:42.318 --> 49:44.862
"for richer, for poorer" bit
of the wedding vows.

49:58.084 --> 50:00.169
ARCHIE: Isobel?

50:00.253 --> 50:03.756
Owing to the power cut
I haven't been able
to complete my report.

50:03.840 --> 50:09.262
But I shall be recommending
that you receive
your grant in full.

50:11.264 --> 50:14.892
-Well, I don't understand.
-And I'm not about to explain.

50:14.976 --> 50:16.853
I shall be leaving directly.

50:16.936 --> 50:19.981
Erm, there's been a slight
problem with your car.

50:21.065 --> 50:23.568
Then perhaps
you'd call me a taxi.

50:25.445 --> 50:27.405
A word of advice.

50:27.488 --> 50:31.784
Don't take anything
for granted until you get
him down the aisle.

50:34.912 --> 50:38.249
-Who would like an ice cream?
-KIDS: Me!

50:38.332 --> 50:39.751
Come on, then.

50:45.757 --> 50:48.801
-Was that a smile?
-Getting on for one.

50:53.014 --> 50:56.726
Look,
Golly, I owe you an apology.

50:56.809 --> 51:01.064
What I said to you yesterday
was unfair and I should
have known better.

51:01.147 --> 51:05.151
And while we're at it,
I should have
listened to Lexie, too.

51:05.234 --> 51:09.072
But I've...
I've learnt my lesson.

51:09.155 --> 51:10.907
Oh,
I've got something for you.

51:18.247 --> 51:21.167
I'm not going to
rent out your croft.

51:21.250 --> 51:26.047
Once it's refurbished,
it's yours. You'll own it.

51:26.130 --> 51:29.842
-But you need the money.
-Yeah, but we'll
find it somewhere else.

51:29.926 --> 51:32.387
We've got this
grant for a start.

51:36.557 --> 51:39.435
Thank you.

51:39.519 --> 51:44.148
You said something
yesterday about me
trying to buy your approval.

51:44.232 --> 51:47.110
Well,
I'm not trying to do that.

51:47.193 --> 51:49.862
I need you to tell me
when I'm getting things wrong.

51:49.946 --> 51:52.949
-That's if you'll listen.
-Well, I'll try.

51:56.202 --> 51:58.162
I guess, in a way,

51:58.246 --> 52:00.581
we're paying the price
for my father keeping things
the same for so long.

52:00.665 --> 52:02.458
Maybe.

52:02.542 --> 52:07.130
-Then again, there's new
tricks in old dogs, son.
-You're not old.

52:08.256 --> 52:10.008
Well, not that old.

52:12.260 --> 52:16.222
Day one,
55 visitors, no revenue.

52:16.305 --> 52:20.143
Yeah,
but they all had a nice time
and they'll tell their mates.

52:20.226 --> 52:22.228
And they'll all
expect free ice cream.

52:24.272 --> 52:27.817
Look, last night you
said something like,

52:27.900 --> 52:29.569
"Well, if I'm no use
at being a laird,

52:29.652 --> 52:31.779
then I'll be no use
at being a husband."

52:31.863 --> 52:35.241
Well, I've been
thinking about that.

52:35.324 --> 52:39.245
And I think that being a laird
is a bit like being a husband.

52:40.621 --> 52:42.290
You can't do it on your own.

52:43.374 --> 52:45.043
But I'm with you.

52:47.170 --> 52:50.381
Oh, not
interrupting anything, am I?

52:50.465 --> 52:53.551
No, no, just a bit of
creative accounting.

52:53.634 --> 52:58.348
-Molly, they're lovely.
Who are they from?
-Me, for you.

52:58.431 --> 52:59.891
For your anniversary.

52:59.974 --> 53:02.226
Well, we're not getting
married for another month.

53:02.310 --> 53:06.105
Ah, the anniversary of the day
you arrived on our doorstep.

53:06.189 --> 53:08.733
Mmm, all those years ago.

53:08.816 --> 53:10.943
Watch it,
I can still change my mind.

53:11.027 --> 53:14.280
To think we nearly made
the same mistake twice.
First Lexie, then Esme.

53:14.364 --> 53:16.157
Well, some people never learn.

53:16.240 --> 53:19.702
Oh, by the way,
I took £50 from the safe.
Forgot to say.

53:19.786 --> 53:22.080
-Did you close the door?
-Sorry.
