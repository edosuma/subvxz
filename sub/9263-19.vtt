Hey, Buddy!
Oh!

00:04.505 --> 00:05.839
Lying son of a bitch!

00:05.881 --> 00:07.007
I think you need
to worry about your family.

00:07.007 --> 00:07.841
Pam will forgive me.

00:07.883 --> 00:10.511
I was taking some medication
for a while

00:10.511 --> 00:12.012
and now
I'm off of it.

00:12.012 --> 00:15.015
I feel better
than I've ever felt.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.141
Waverly?

00:16.183 --> 00:18.352
I'd like to talk to you
about your academic future.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.603
What am I,

00:19.645 --> 00:21.146
Absolutely.

The athletic director over
at TMU called this afternoon

00:24.191 --> 00:25.859

00:25.901 --> 00:26.526
You have been invited

00:26.568 --> 00:28.362

in Austin.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.363
No way!

I'm Bo Miller.

next‐door neighbor.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.038
He's a funny kid.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.748
I'm sure you've got
your hands full.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.375
Your rain gutter's
falling off, huh?

00:41.416 --> 00:45.003
Yeah. That's on my long list
of things to do.

00:45.045 --> 00:45.671
I love you.

turn‐of‐the‐century.

Turn of what century?

00:55.013 --> 00:57.474
Ooh.
Original floors.

00:57.516 --> 00:58.684
It needs a little work.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.894
Sounds like a money pit.
I think that sounds
like fun.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.145
If we're doing this,
we're gonna have to plan

01:02.187 --> 01:03.480
a trip to Austin soon.

01:03.522 --> 01:04.731
We're gonna have
to get a broker.

our house on the market.

was offered

01:17.953 --> 01:21.790

I'm not going.

can't mention this to anyone,

Sure.

I'll be living by myself

So that means‐‐

08:54.701 --> 08:56.870
what does that mean?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.705
(Waverly)
It just means
I get these mood swings.

08:58.705 --> 09:03.043
But they're, like,
extreme.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.711
You know, to, like,
the tenth power.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.671
It could be dangerous
sometimes.

09:06.713 --> 09:09.841
I mean, people get
really depressed,

09:09.883 --> 09:15.013
um, even suicidal, and...

09:15.055 --> 09:17.057
Wow.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.392
If you could see
your terrified face right now‐‐

09:19.434 --> 09:23.229
No, no.

09:23.271 --> 09:26.691
I just need time to digest,
that's all.

09:29.778 --> 09:32.072
(Buddy)
This is gonna be fantastic.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.073
Um, where's that picture‐‐

09:33.114 --> 09:35.241
All of us were burying
each other in the sand.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.744
Tami and little Buddy, Jr.
and your mom and I.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.913
Those were the good old days,
weren't they?

09:42.290 --> 09:44.417
[chuckling]

09:44.417 --> 09:46.252
This is gonna be great.

09:46.252 --> 09:50.423
Dad, are you sure
that this is the right thing?

09:50.423 --> 09:52.383
I mean, photo outlining?

09:52.425 --> 09:53.718
Yeah...I do.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.763
Honey,
I saw this on Dr. Phil.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.431
And your mom,
when she sees this,

09:58.431 --> 10:00.100
she is just gonna melt,

10:00.100 --> 10:01.935
especially when she sees that,
you know,

10:01.935 --> 10:03.770
you and I did this together

10:03.812 --> 10:05.772
and put this thing together.

10:05.772 --> 10:06.648
Yeah, I don't‐‐

10:06.689 --> 10:10.735
I don't know
if I wanna be taking sides.

10:10.777 --> 10:11.778
[sighs]

10:11.778 --> 10:12.904
I‐‐

10:12.946 --> 10:15.448
You're not taking sides.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.118
Don't you think maybe

10:18.118 --> 10:19.452
she deserves
a little more time?

10:19.452 --> 10:21.996
Lyla, I can't.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.039
I can't.

10:23.081 --> 10:27.127
I can't stay here any longer
by myself in this place.

10:27.168 --> 10:30.797
I can't live
without my family.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.298
Tell you the truth,
Lyla,

10:32.340 --> 10:35.093
I, uh,
I got no reason to live

10:35.135 --> 10:37.762
without my family.

10:37.804 --> 10:41.766
Why'd you do it?

10:41.808 --> 10:44.310
Why didn't you think about it,
Dad?

10:44.352 --> 10:46.938
Lyla,
your dad's a sinner.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.107
I'm a weak man.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.817
But it was one mistake.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.319
I swear, Lyla,

10:53.319 --> 10:56.322
I will never ever
do anything

10:56.322 --> 10:59.284
to hurt this family again,
honey.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.119
I swear.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.167
(Bo)
Guys, stop!

11:07.208 --> 11:08.001
I'm gonna kick your butt!

11:08.001 --> 11:09.127
(bully #1)
Yeah, whatever!

11:09.169 --> 11:10.128
(bully #2)
Yeah, right.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.129
(bully #1)
Mickey Mouse!

11:11.171 --> 11:12.839
(bully #3)
Pip‐squeak.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.175
(bully #1)
You gonna cry or something
'cause she's not here.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.510
Hey!

11:17.510 --> 11:19.345
(Riggins)
What do you think
you're doing?

11:19.345 --> 11:20.346
We were just playing
with him.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.472
Yeah?

11:21.514 --> 11:23.016
You okay?

11:23.016 --> 11:24.017
Yeah, I think so.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.351
(Riggins)
You were just playing
with him?

11:25.351 --> 11:26.352
Four on one.
Double his size.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.812
Is that playing
with him?

11:27.854 --> 11:28.938
Yeah.
It is, isn't it?

11:28.980 --> 11:31.482
If I ever so much see you look
at this kid the wrong way

11:31.524 --> 11:32.859
I'm gonna find you,

11:32.859 --> 11:34.027
I'm gonna punch a hole
in your chest

11:34.027 --> 11:35.195
and rip your heart out.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.487
Are we clear?
Yeah.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.864
You sure?!
Yeah.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.532
Now get outta here.

11:42.869 --> 11:43.995
You okay?

11:44.037 --> 11:45.914
I think so.
You sure?

11:45.914 --> 11:47.582
I'm sorry I'm late, bro.

11:47.582 --> 11:49.417
Are you kidding?
That rocked.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.877
That happen
all the time?

11:50.919 --> 11:52.212
Every day.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.880
Yeah.

11:53.922 --> 11:56.341
I can't believe Tim Riggins
is picking me up from school!

12:02.889 --> 12:05.892
(Taylor)
The fact of the matter is
we did think about you.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.060
Austin's a‐‐

12:07.101 --> 12:08.519
You know,
it's an arty kinda town.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.437
You're arty.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.899
It's arty.
It's a good match.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.568
And there's a lot of culture
in Austin.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.695
There's a lot of dance.
You love dance.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.572
There's a hell of a lot
of dance.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.907
There's dancing all
over Austin.

12:20.949 --> 12:24.744
There's an Austin dance troupe.
Tell her.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.371
Tell her about all of it.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.122
There are lots of different
kinds of dancing, honey.

12:28.122 --> 12:30.750
and they've got
a beautiful ballet.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.585
No, they've got
an excellent ballet there

12:32.627 --> 12:33.419
is what they got.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.755
They got some
top‐notch "ballet‐ers."

12:39.926 --> 12:41.761
(Taylor)
Oh, the look.

12:41.803 --> 12:42.929
That's a great look.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.389
Fine.
There is no problem.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.431
You're done.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.599
That's the way
you wanna do it?

12:46.641 --> 12:48.059
That's great.
[door slams]

12:48.101 --> 12:50.395
You have nothing
to worry about...

12:50.436 --> 12:51.437
here.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.438
Trust me.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.606
Landry's actually right.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.941
No, he's not right.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.943
I can't step up
against the Brant line.

12:56.985 --> 12:58.611
I'm not even gonna be able
to see over there.

12:58.653 --> 12:59.779
(Landry)
You know what, Matt?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.781
Worst‐case scenario,
you lose.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.950
All right?
And that's no big deal.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.451
Yeah, it's a big deal

13:05.493 --> 13:06.786
because then this whole town
is gonna murder me.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.621
And then I'm gonna be sitting
on the bench again.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.580
I'm gonna start one year,

13:09.622 --> 13:11.666
and then be riding
the bench the next year.

13:11.666 --> 13:13.793
You will never be
second string again.

13:13.835 --> 13:14.961
Okay?

13:14.961 --> 13:16.462
Coach loves you.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.964
You, you are‐‐

13:17.964 --> 13:20.466
you are his little engine
that could, okay?

13:20.466 --> 13:22.969
You're his Seabiscuit.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.804
Julie, back me up on this.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.098
Coach Taylor loves you so much
that you will always be QB1

13:27.140 --> 13:28.933
as long as he's here.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.810
Right, Julie?

13:30.852 --> 13:33.771
Yeah.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.650
(Street)
So now pretty much
half the town hates me

13:37.692 --> 13:39.444
because I'm suing
the football team.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.654
(Suzy)
Doesn't that make you wanna
get outta there?

13:41.696 --> 13:42.697
(Street)
Outta where?

13:42.739 --> 13:45.992
(Suzy)
Out of Dillon.
Just leave‐‐screw them!

13:46.034 --> 13:48.828
Go where?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.663
Go where?
I don't know‐‐anywhere.

13:50.705 --> 13:53.708
No, I'm engaged.
I can't go anywhere.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.460
It's hard for me
to understand

13:55.501 --> 13:58.004
why anybody would want
to be somewhere

13:58.004 --> 13:59.839
where they're not wanted.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.841
It's home.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.801
Only home I've ever known.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.679
It's just...I can't imagine
I'll be going anywhere else

14:06.721 --> 14:08.014
anytime soon.

14:08.014 --> 14:11.684
How about Stonehenge II?

14:11.726 --> 14:12.685
Stonehenge II?

14:12.685 --> 14:14.020
Have you ever heard
of it?

14:14.020 --> 14:15.688
Uh‐uh.
It's right over here.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.148
Really?
Yeah, we'll go.
It'll cheer you up.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.695
(Tami)
Tyra is such a lovely girl.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.155
She's a beautiful girl.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.824
My concern is that she's
kinda riding on her looks,

14:26.866 --> 14:27.658
and not really using
the brain.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.828
And I think
she's got a great brain.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.580
And you know...

14:32.580 --> 14:35.249
that looks thing
ain't gonna last forever.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.710
So I wanna help her
with the other part of it.

14:37.752 --> 14:38.878
[sighs]

14:38.878 --> 14:42.006
Yeah, I'm not really clear
why you got me down here.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.674
Sorry, I'll tell you.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.592
I, um‐‐

14:44.634 --> 14:46.719
I'm thinking that
if we worked together‐‐

14:46.761 --> 14:49.222
if you and kinda did sort of
a tag team

14:49.222 --> 14:52.058
and went at her
from both sides‐‐

14:52.100 --> 14:53.726
we could really let her know

14:53.768 --> 14:54.727
that this is an important,
critical moment

14:54.769 --> 14:57.063
in her academic life.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.565
You know, I think
that would get her working

14:59.565 --> 15:03.194
and really create some hope that
she can turn this thing around.

15:03.236 --> 15:06.072
Turn around?
I think she's doing pretty well.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.740
It's not like
she's some kind of criminal

15:07.740 --> 15:08.741
or something.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.867
No, no.
Of course not.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.703
What I'm saying is that
I see so much potential in her.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.123
And I wanna help her
reach that.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.290
I was gonna‐‐

15:16.290 --> 15:18.084
I was asking you...

15:18.084 --> 15:21.587
to help with that.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.089
Tyra is at great risk
of not graduating

15:23.131 --> 15:24.882
from high school.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.595
Oh, my God.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.597
You know who I saw
at the dry cleaner?

15:31.639 --> 15:32.765
You're not gonna believe this.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.100
Who?
Vickie.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.601
She must be in love.
I'm telling you.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.937
She has put on a few.
I mean, I should talk.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.605
I know, but.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.941
Momma?

15:41.983 --> 15:43.609
Sorry.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.945
Yeah.
You just keep at it,
honey.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.948
Really proud of you,
my little schoolgirl.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.950
But I mean, honestly.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.785
I mean,
she's a good‐looking girl too.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.786
(Buddy on TV)
Hi, I'm Buddy Garrity.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.288
Most of y'all know me.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.497
For those of you who don't,

15:56.539 --> 15:57.665
I'll tell you right now
that you will not find

15:57.707 --> 16:00.126
a better deal
on sales or service anywhere

16:00.168 --> 16:02.628
in all of west central Texas.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.963
We pride ourselves

16:04.005 --> 16:07.091
on three pillars
of prosperity:

16:08.801 --> 16:10.928
Also right now,
I'm gonna throw in‐‐

16:10.970 --> 16:13.139
Just turn it off.
You already know he's a loser.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.266
And two Panther
play‐off tickets.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.976
Just remember,
deep in the heart of Texas,

16:16.976 --> 16:17.977
deep in my heart,

16:17.977 --> 16:19.812
I'm your Buddy!

16:19.854 --> 16:21.647
What heart?
There's a cold stone in there.

16:21.647 --> 16:22.815
There's a stone
in his heart.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.818
You know what?
I've got a great idea.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.945
Let's go pick up your sister

16:27.987 --> 16:28.863
at the club...

16:28.905 --> 16:31.324
and go get our nails done
at the salon.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.826
I can't do that.
I got tons of homework.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.661
I got an exam
in a couple weeks.

16:35.661 --> 16:36.829
Well, I've got
that severance money

16:36.829 --> 16:37.955
from that sleazeball.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.874
I think we should just
go spend it all, don't you?

16:39.916 --> 16:41.876
Come on.
Pedicure.

16:41.876 --> 16:42.960
Think about your toes.

16:44.837 --> 16:48.007
It's amazing, huh?

16:48.049 --> 16:49.634
Yeah.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.011
There's no words
to describe it.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.013
[laughing]

16:54.013 --> 16:56.933
(Street)
Words are not enough.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.854
So how'd you and Lyla
get engaged?

17:01.896 --> 17:04.857
Uh, we called a meeting.

17:04.899 --> 17:05.858
You called a meeting?

17:05.900 --> 17:08.694
Yeah, we sat down
and we came to a decision.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.155
We thought
it was a good idea.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.032
You were fighting.
Yeah.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.367
Yeah.

17:14.367 --> 17:19.413
What was it about?

17:19.413 --> 17:21.415
Uh, she slept
with my best friend.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.377
I'd propose.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.879
[chuckles]

17:26.879 --> 17:27.880
Yeah.

17:27.922 --> 17:30.216
I guess I was just...

17:30.258 --> 17:31.717
grasping at straws,
you know?

17:31.759 --> 17:33.886
I had lost everything else.

17:33.886 --> 17:37.890
Thought if I did it,
I wouldn't lose her too.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.392
I hear ya.

17:42.770 --> 17:47.400
Why are you so easy
to talk to?

17:47.441 --> 17:50.403
I just start saying things
I don't say to anybody else

17:50.444 --> 17:51.904
to you.
What do you mean?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.239
You're not like this
all the time?

17:53.281 --> 17:54.699
Never.

18:15.386 --> 18:16.345
[laughing]

18:16.387 --> 18:17.597
Come on.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.850
Honey,
are you watching?

18:20.891 --> 18:22.268
'Cause it's fun to dance
with your father.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.769
He's a good dancer.

18:23.769 --> 18:24.604
[laughing]

18:24.645 --> 18:26.397
(Tami)
And you know what?

18:26.439 --> 18:27.940
If you happen
to find yourself

18:27.940 --> 18:29.358
with a dancer
who's not so good,

18:29.400 --> 18:32.111
you just take lead.

18:32.153 --> 18:34.780
And I find, basically,
if you just lead with your hips,

18:34.780 --> 18:35.781
the rest'll follow you.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.950
You don't need to lead
too close to the hips.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.702
Well, you know what I mean.
That's just‐‐

18:39.744 --> 18:41.912
As a girl,
that's generally what‐‐

18:41.996 --> 18:43.914
Come on, get up here.
You try.

18:43.956 --> 18:44.957
It's fun.
Come on.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.334
I'm not going
to the dance.
All right, fine.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.627
You don't wanna go
to the dance,

18:47.668 --> 18:48.794
you don't have to go
to the dance.

18:48.836 --> 18:49.920
I've got things
to do.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.631
Well, good.
Then I'm excused.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.299
No, y'all are going
to the father‐daughter dance!

18:53.299 --> 18:54.884
I'm gonna pull out my camera.

18:54.925 --> 18:55.968
I'm gonna take a picture
of you both.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.720
You're gonna look real happy,

18:57.762 --> 18:59.263
and I'm gonna cherish it
for the rest of my life.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.807
So y'all stop being a pain
in the ass
[knock on door]

19:01.807 --> 19:03.976
and make me happy
for once!

19:05.144 --> 19:06.812
[door opens]

19:06.812 --> 19:09.148
(Tami)
Hey, Tyra.
How are you?

19:09.148 --> 19:11.734
Here for the old
tutoring session.

19:11.776 --> 19:12.818
Oh, great.
Good, good.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.820
Left, right.

19:14.862 --> 19:15.988
Right.

19:15.988 --> 19:16.906
Okay.
Now remember.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.116
You're in the schoolyard.
Anything goes.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.785
That means groin kicks,
eye gouges.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.328
Spit in his eye.
I don't care.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.163
You do
whatever it takes.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.957
Okay? Who's it gonna be?
Me!

19:26.999 --> 19:28.334
Exactly.
All right. You ready?

19:28.376 --> 19:29.960
Okay.
Again.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.673
Remember‐‐accurate.
Let's go.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.966
Left.
Right.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.009
Right.

19:37.051 --> 19:38.135
Nice.
Left.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.679
(Bo)
Hyah!

19:39.720 --> 19:40.846
Hey.

19:40.888 --> 19:41.972
There it is.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.182
So what's going on here?

19:43.182 --> 19:46.143
Tim Riggins is teaching me
how to kick some serious ass.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.978
Great.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.438
How you doing?

19:49.480 --> 19:50.856
Will you run in
and get Momma a soda

19:50.856 --> 19:52.024
with one of those
delicious limes

19:52.024 --> 19:52.983
you put in it?

19:53.025 --> 19:53.984
Okay.

19:54.026 --> 19:54.985
Thank you.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.029
Bo, don't forget.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.198
Who's it gonna be?
Me!

19:59.240 --> 20:01.158
What the hell are you doing?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.285
What do you mean
what am I doing?

20:03.327 --> 20:05.037
Are you teaching him
to fight?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.247
Maybe.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.082
Why you do that?
I'm a pacifist.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.000
I'll tell you why.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.711
Remember when I went
to pick him up at school?

20:11.752 --> 20:12.837
Yeah.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.296
Well, there was about four kids
ready to kick his ass.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.006
Four guy‐‐
Are you kidding me?

20:16.048 --> 20:17.383
Where?
At school.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.884
At the school?
Where was the school monitor?

20:18.926 --> 20:20.886
Well, that's the thing.
Maybe I was a bit late.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.138
You were late!

20:22.179 --> 20:23.222
Didn't I emphasize to you

20:23.264 --> 20:24.306
the importance
of not being late?

20:24.348 --> 20:25.975
Look, the point of the matter
is you can't be there

20:26.016 --> 20:28.352
every second of his life
to protect him, okay?

20:28.394 --> 20:30.730
He's gotta learn
to protect himself.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.482
I think if you teach him
to ignore the bully,

20:33.524 --> 20:35.067
the bully'll go away.
You know what?

20:35.109 --> 20:36.861
No offense,
but if you ignore a bully,

20:36.902 --> 20:38.195
he's just gonna
kick your ass ever more.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.363
How do you know?

20:39.405 --> 20:40.406
Were you bullied
in the fourth grade?

20:40.448 --> 20:42.032
No.

20:42.074 --> 20:42.908
I was the bully.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.077
Mm‐hmm and why does that
not surprise me?

20:45.119 --> 20:47.204
Look.
I like the kid.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.207
May be a bit awkward and weird,
but he's a good kid, you know?

20:50.249 --> 20:52.251
You being a pacifist is fine.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.920
But him in the fourth grade
as a pacifist,

20:54.962 --> 20:57.006
all that means is
a punching bag.

20:57.047 --> 20:59.216
I just want him to be able
to defend himself.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.259
Here you go, Mom.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.178
Hey.
There he is.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.180
Thank you.
That is perfect.

21:04.221 --> 21:08.768
All right,
well...finish up...

21:08.768 --> 21:11.771
with your, uh...lesson.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.397
Will do.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.026
You ready for round two?

21:17.067 --> 21:18.235
Ready!
Um...

21:18.277 --> 21:20.863
You know, we're gonna watch
Back to the Future...

21:20.905 --> 21:22.239
for the thousandth time...

21:22.281 --> 21:24.283
if you wanna watch it
with us tonight.

21:24.325 --> 21:26.243
Sure.
Yes.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.037
All right.

21:28.078 --> 21:29.121
[whispering]
All right.

21:29.163 --> 21:31.081
[whispering]
Yes!
Yes.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.124
(Taylor)
Tyra?
Uh‐huh.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.167
I just want you
to know

21:33.209 --> 21:35.961
that you're about to experience
award‐winning chili.

21:36.003 --> 21:38.422
Oh, yes.
It's award‐winning chili.

21:38.464 --> 21:39.799
It is award‐winning.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.091
It won an award
at Dillon Days.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.426
It did not win an aw‐‐

21:42.468 --> 21:44.261
It won the booby prize.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.055
It didn't win the booby prize.
It wasn't the booby prize.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.515
The Sympathy Prize.

21:47.556 --> 21:50.059
(Tami)
It was the best first‐timer.
The Sympathy Prize!

21:50.100 --> 21:51.977
Do you like your chili spicy,
lady?

21:51.977 --> 21:53.229
I like spice.
You like it spicy?

21:53.270 --> 21:54.605
Sure.

21:54.647 --> 21:55.940
I'm gonna get you some
spicy chili a‐‐

21:55.981 --> 21:56.857
Hey, Miss Collette.
How are you doing?

21:56.899 --> 21:58.442
I knocked.
I guess nobody heard, I guess.

21:58.484 --> 21:59.944
That doorbell's been broken
for years.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.237
People just come in
all the time.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.488
How are you?
I'm fine.

22:02.488 --> 22:03.948
You know Julie.
That's my husband.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.157
That's Eric.
Nice to meet you.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.826
You know Julie.

22:06.867 --> 22:07.952
Sure.
Hi, Julie.
Hey.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.036
I'm just about to serve out
some award‐winning chili.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.830
It's the best chili
you'll ever have.

22:10.871 --> 22:11.997
No, that sounds nice.
I can't.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.165
We can't.

22:13.207 --> 22:14.875
We've gotta go,
but thank you.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.126
Of course we can stay, Mom.

22:16.168 --> 22:16.877
We can't.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.420
I've actually made dinner
at home.

22:18.462 --> 22:19.839
(Angela)
I cook three meals a day
for my kids

22:19.880 --> 22:21.507
just like regular people.

22:21.507 --> 22:24.134
So we gotta go.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.427
Come on.
Get your stuff.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.012
Okay.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.848
Thank you.

22:28.889 --> 22:29.974
What do you think,

22:30.015 --> 22:31.642
they're gonna feed us chili,
then hold us hostage?

22:31.684 --> 22:34.144
What are you doing in there
with those people?

22:34.186 --> 22:36.146
What are you doing?

22:36.188 --> 22:37.523
Learning something,
maybe.

22:37.523 --> 22:40.484
Oh, well,
let me tell you something.

22:40.526 --> 22:43.153
All these ideas she has for you
about going to college‐‐

22:43.195 --> 22:44.113
Do you have any idea

22:44.154 --> 22:46.365
how expensive Texas Tech is
per semester?

22:46.407 --> 22:48.033
You are not going
to college, honey.

22:48.075 --> 22:49.201
You're not going
to Texas Tech

22:49.201 --> 22:50.202
because we can't afford it.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.204
So all these ideas
she has

22:52.204 --> 22:53.289
about you going
to college‐‐

22:53.330 --> 22:55.207
She's filling your head up
with stuff

22:55.249 --> 22:56.917
that you cannot live out.

22:56.959 --> 22:59.336
That is not nice,
in my opinion...

22:59.378 --> 23:01.547
to fill your head
like that.

23:01.589 --> 23:04.383
[truck starting]

23:34.413 --> 23:36.498
Oh, no, I got it.

23:37.625 --> 23:40.252
Oh.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.267
[whispers]
Wow.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.352
I don't even know
how to thank you

23:56.393 --> 23:57.686
for everything
you've done.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.063
No worries.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.564
He's sound asleep.

24:00.606 --> 24:03.150
You're so‐‐

24:06.779 --> 24:08.113
What are you doing?!

24:08.155 --> 24:10.574
Um, I'm sorry.
What are you doing?

24:10.616 --> 24:11.575
I misread the situation.
You're a kid.

24:11.617 --> 24:12.368
You're right.

24:12.409 --> 24:14.286
Go home.
Tim, you need to go home.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.287
Yes, ma'am.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.165
[muffled]
Oh, my God!

24:18.165 --> 24:19.667
Oh, my God.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.090
[knocking]

24:26.131 --> 24:27.341
Come in!

24:37.476 --> 24:38.435
Where've you been?

24:38.477 --> 24:40.980
I been calling you
for two days.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.232
I came by to ask your parents
what was going on.

24:43.273 --> 24:45.275
I didn't make the team.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.443
That's what's going on.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.698
I'm sorry.

24:52.282 --> 24:56.078
What are you doing
with your trophies?

24:56.120 --> 24:57.079
Can't look at 'em anymore.

24:57.121 --> 24:59.164
You can't look
at them anymore?

24:59.206 --> 25:01.208
No.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.002
Why haven't you called?

25:03.002 --> 25:04.461
Do you know
how worried I was?

25:04.503 --> 25:06.422
I'm home,
I'm safe, I'm here.

25:06.463 --> 25:09.633
Nothing to worry about,
okay?

25:09.675 --> 25:13.178
That's it?

25:13.178 --> 25:14.304
How did you get home?

25:14.346 --> 25:15.514
Isn't Herc still
in Austin?

25:15.514 --> 25:17.808
I got a ride.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.810
From who?

25:19.852 --> 25:21.645
Suzy, actually.

25:21.687 --> 25:24.148
The, uh, tattoo artist.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.357
Yeah, I remember.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.151
She had a refrigerator
in the back of her truck

25:27.192 --> 25:28.652
she had to drop off
in Barton, so‐‐

25:28.694 --> 25:29.695
Sounds good.

25:29.695 --> 25:32.031
Sounds like a win‐win.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.365
Nothing happened.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.535
Happen?
What could happen?

25:36.577 --> 25:38.328
Nothing.
It was just a ride.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.580
A ride from
a really cute girl

25:39.621 --> 25:42.332
who gave you a tattoo
and is obviously into you

25:42.374 --> 25:43.667
and you must obviously
be into her.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.502
Or else you wouldn't feel
so guilty

25:45.544 --> 25:46.628
as to tell me
that nothing happened.

25:46.670 --> 25:49.339
Things have been tough
on both of us lately, all right?

25:49.381 --> 25:50.466
A little confusing.

25:50.507 --> 25:51.675
What's that supposed
to mean?

25:51.717 --> 25:53.469
I'm just saying that‐‐

25:53.510 --> 25:55.387
Just because I had an affair
that it's okay for you.

25:55.387 --> 25:59.058
Because it's not, Jason.
It's not.

25:59.099 --> 26:02.311
Lyla,
I didn't have an affair.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.398
Let's just be really,
really honest

26:06.398 --> 26:10.736
with each other
right now, Jason.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.780
Do you wanna be engaged
to me?

26:16.867 --> 26:18.744
Do you?

26:20.746 --> 26:22.122
I don't know.

26:31.298 --> 26:32.257
[doorbell rings]

26:32.299 --> 26:33.801
(Pam)
I got it.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.934
Hi, Pammy.

26:41.934 --> 26:44.603
I want you to leave
right now.

26:44.645 --> 26:45.771
Pam, please,
please, please!

26:45.813 --> 26:47.106
Pam!
Be calm, okay?

26:47.147 --> 26:48.607
What do you want, Buddy?
Let's just be calm.

26:48.649 --> 26:49.900
What do you want?

26:49.942 --> 26:52.236
I have something very special
that I'd like to present to you.

26:53.237 --> 26:54.363
What's this?

26:54.404 --> 26:56.865
This is the Garrity
family album.

26:56.907 --> 26:58.700
All the good times.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.869
Look at this.

27:00.911 --> 27:01.954
(Buddy)
Remember these?

27:01.954 --> 27:04.832
I wasn't so bad
when I was young, was I?

27:04.873 --> 27:06.667
Lyla...

27:06.708 --> 27:09.128
helped me put it together.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.963
I need you
to listen to me

27:11.004 --> 27:13.298
when I tell you I don't want you
coming over here again.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.134
You have done enough.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.301
(Pam)
I have been embarrassed

27:16.343 --> 27:18.137
in front of
this entire town.

27:18.178 --> 27:19.304
Okay?

27:19.304 --> 27:21.140
Pam, look.
No!

27:21.140 --> 27:22.975
You have made a laughingstock
out of this family

27:22.975 --> 27:26.061
to the point where I have
considered leaving my home.

27:26.103 --> 27:27.896
You take your damn memories,
Buddy,

27:27.938 --> 27:28.897
and you get out.

27:28.939 --> 27:29.857
Because right now,

27:29.898 --> 27:31.650
I am just trying
to hold this family together.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.610
So please leave!
Pam, I've always loved‐‐

27:36.113 --> 27:37.114
Mom.

27:37.155 --> 27:38.740
Lyla, I do not want you
taking his side again.

27:38.782 --> 27:40.659
I'm not taking sides.
Yes, you are, Lyla.

27:40.701 --> 27:41.827
And it hurts.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.745
I didn't, Mom.
He made one mistake.

27:43.787 --> 27:45.455
Doesn't he deserve
a second chance?

27:45.497 --> 27:46.874
I mean,
you can at least talk to him.

27:46.915 --> 27:47.958
(Buddy)
Please!
No.

27:48.000 --> 27:48.959
One mistake, remember?

27:48.959 --> 27:50.836
(Pam)
You don't know what he is.

27:50.878 --> 27:52.671
(Lyla)
He made one mistake!

27:52.671 --> 27:53.839
(Pam)
He is a liar!

27:53.839 --> 27:54.882
He is my father!

27:54.923 --> 27:57.092
He has been unfaithful to me
for our entire marriage.

27:57.134 --> 27:58.760
It isn't just Angela!

27:58.802 --> 28:00.012
You don't think
I know about Ruth,

28:00.012 --> 28:01.847
your last secretary,
and why she left?!

28:01.847 --> 28:03.265
What are you talking about?

28:03.307 --> 28:04.558
(Pam)
And I am sorry that you have
to hear this.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.935
I'm sorry your own daughter
has to hear me say this.

28:06.977 --> 28:08.770
You bastard!

28:08.812 --> 28:10.188
Look what you've done
to us!

28:10.230 --> 28:11.773
(Buddy)
It's not true, Lyla.

28:11.815 --> 28:12.941
(Pam)
I am sorry.

28:12.983 --> 28:14.192
(Buddy)
Pam, please.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.277
Sorry.

28:15.319 --> 28:18.196
Lyla?

28:18.238 --> 28:19.281
Let Daddy in, honey.

28:19.323 --> 28:21.867
Leave!

28:31.335 --> 28:33.712
(Taylor)
I know she's never really
liked Dillon.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.880
I mean, she never has,

28:34.880 --> 28:36.214
but you'd think
she'd like Austin.

28:36.214 --> 28:37.716
I know she'd like Austin.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.885
I know, sweetie.
I agree with you.

28:39.927 --> 28:40.802
Which one of these
should I wear?

28:40.844 --> 28:42.804
Oh, the blue.

28:42.846 --> 28:47.851
Oh, you're gonna look like
super dapper dad in that blue.

28:49.186 --> 28:51.396
Can you help me
with that?

28:51.396 --> 28:54.066
Tighter than a drum
like always.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.026
Oh, it feels good.

28:58.362 --> 29:00.155
You know what?

29:00.197 --> 29:01.156
Hmm?

29:01.198 --> 29:03.742
I don't think it has anything
to do with Dillon.

29:03.784 --> 29:05.911
I think it has to do
with me, babe. It's me.

29:05.911 --> 29:06.912
No, I don't think it's you.
It is me.

29:06.954 --> 29:09.039
I don't think it's you.
I don't think it's Dillon.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.040
I don't think it's Austin.

29:10.082 --> 29:12.834
What is it then?

29:12.876 --> 29:15.087
I think our little girl's
in love.

29:15.087 --> 29:18.048
I know it.

29:20.425 --> 29:23.428
Hey.
Woooow.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.263
You look really nice.

29:25.263 --> 29:27.766
I'm only going
for one song.

29:27.808 --> 29:29.935
And then I'm going home.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.812
All right. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

29:33.563 --> 29:35.732
I'm taking your picture.

29:37.401 --> 29:38.902
Smile.

29:45.909 --> 29:47.369
Can't sell that to you.

29:47.411 --> 29:49.121
You're not gonna sell it to me
'cause I'm crippled?

29:49.121 --> 29:50.497
No, I'm not gonna
sell it to you

29:50.497 --> 29:53.000
because you're 17.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.209
Come on, Ant.

29:54.251 --> 29:56.545
If I was still playing‐‐

29:56.586 --> 29:58.547
Jason,
I can't sell it to you.

29:58.588 --> 30:00.048
Try down the street.

30:00.090 --> 30:01.550
I already did.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.844
You drinking alone,
Six?

30:05.804 --> 30:07.973
You got an I. D., sir?

30:08.015 --> 30:11.018
You bet.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.067
Appreciate your business,
Sergeant Riggins.

30:19.109 --> 30:21.445
[laughing]

30:23.989 --> 30:25.365
Don't have too much fun.

30:28.326 --> 30:31.038
Yeah.
Have a great night.

30:31.038 --> 30:33.206
(Smash)
All you wear is Panther gear.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.876
You got Panther T‐shirts,
you got Panther sweatshirts.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.002
I think you forgot
something.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.211
You didn't have
to do that, man.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.006
(Smash)
It's, like, quilted,
you know?

30:41.048 --> 30:42.174
Oh, you‐‐oh!

30:42.174 --> 30:43.341
Oh.
Street!

30:43.341 --> 30:45.844
Hey, Street!
Hey, Street!

30:45.886 --> 30:46.928
How you doing, Smash?

30:46.970 --> 30:48.346
What's going on, baby?

30:48.388 --> 30:49.514
What it do?

30:49.514 --> 30:50.515
Hey, you wanna
come out with us?

30:50.557 --> 30:52.017
No, I don't, I don't‐‐

30:52.017 --> 30:53.018
Hey, come on.
You should come with us.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.019
Yeah, man.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.520
Uh, I‐‐oh!

30:55.520 --> 30:56.938
Come on, man.

30:56.980 --> 30:57.981
Look, we'll put your chair
in the trunk.

30:59.357 --> 31:02.360
(Saracen)
So what do you mean
she's bipolar?

31:02.360 --> 31:03.528
(Smash)
It means she crazy.

31:03.528 --> 31:04.946
(Street)
Look, Matt.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.198
It just means that
she got issues, you know,

31:06.239 --> 31:08.200
just like everybody else
in this town.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.367
How you handling it?

31:09.367 --> 31:11.870
Taking it like a man,
Matty.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.163
You know.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.498
Avoiding the calls,
ducking out,

31:14.539 --> 31:15.499
hiding in the bushes.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.209
[laughing]

31:17.209 --> 31:20.462
(Riggins on P. A.)
Ladies and gentlemen!

31:20.504 --> 31:24.382
I present to you,
you, you...

31:24.382 --> 31:29.638
the great and noble men
of Dillon Panther football.

31:29.679 --> 31:30.889
[imitating crowd]

31:30.931 --> 31:32.474
Thank you!

31:32.516 --> 31:33.892
(Riggins)
Cheers, gentlemen.

31:33.892 --> 31:34.893
Thank you, thank you!
Here he come, baby.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.145
(Smash)
Oh, don't miss a step now.

31:37.187 --> 31:39.231
(Street)
Come on down, baby!

31:39.231 --> 31:43.235
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Timmy Riggins!

31:43.276 --> 31:44.986
(Saracen)
No, no, Rig.
Seriously.

31:45.028 --> 31:45.904
I remember Spivey said

31:45.946 --> 31:47.989
he catches anyone messing
around out here,

31:48.031 --> 31:48.990
they're gonna lose game time.

31:49.032 --> 31:51.159
You see what I been
putting up with all season?

31:51.201 --> 31:52.410
Come on, Saracen.
What are they gonna do, huh?

31:52.452 --> 31:53.912
Bench you, start me?

31:53.912 --> 31:57.290
Look at Street, folks.
He's on a tear.

31:57.332 --> 32:00.585
(Saracen)
Seriously, look, I got a lotta
crap going on right now,

32:00.585 --> 32:03.088
and I don't need
another problem, okay?

32:03.088 --> 32:04.339
(Smash)
You got troubles, Matty?

32:04.381 --> 32:05.924
What you got, QB1?

32:05.966 --> 32:08.093
Saracen's got a little something
on his mind, fellas.

32:08.093 --> 32:09.302
(Smash)
Oh, you got troubles, Matty?

32:09.344 --> 32:11.429
Come on, talk to the Smash.
I'll help you out.

32:11.429 --> 32:13.598
I'm just saying.
Never mind.

32:13.598 --> 32:16.101
Look, you wanna see
troubles, look at me.

32:16.101 --> 32:17.602
Me and crazy Wavey.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.271
We comparing
girl problems now?

32:19.312 --> 32:21.606
I just tried to make out
with my next‐door neighbor

32:21.606 --> 32:23.358
who's at least in her
mid‐thirties.

32:23.400 --> 32:27.112
Pretty much got put
through the wall for that one.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.280
So I think I win.

32:28.321 --> 32:30.115
No.

32:30.157 --> 32:33.034
Chair says I win.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.119
Every time.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.203
[laughing]

32:35.245 --> 32:37.164
He, he got that.

32:37.164 --> 32:38.331
Six wins.

32:38.373 --> 32:39.499
[laughter]

32:39.541 --> 32:41.126
All right,
so maybe my problems

32:41.126 --> 32:43.545
aren't as big as y'all's,
but look.

32:43.587 --> 32:44.296
I'm just not gonna be able

32:44.337 --> 32:46.047
to take this team
any further.

32:46.089 --> 32:47.716
I mean, Brant's line is huge.

32:47.757 --> 32:50.051
I mean, I helped get us
to the semi‐finals‐‐that's it.

32:50.093 --> 32:52.387
I'm gonna let
this whole town down.

32:52.429 --> 32:54.639
Their defensive end could
probably beat me in the 40.

32:54.639 --> 32:55.974
I don't understand
how I can help.

32:56.016 --> 32:58.977
I'd be doing better off
on the bench.

32:58.977 --> 33:02.522
Saracen. You wanna play big,
you think big, all right?

33:03.607 --> 33:05.692
I'm gonna show you how.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.653
On the ball!

33:08.653 --> 33:10.322
Come on, Saracen.
You got some work to do.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.157
Line it up, boys!

33:12.199 --> 33:13.575
(Street)
Stay on your toes, Matty.
Stay on your toes.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.160
High, let it go!

33:15.160 --> 33:17.162
Beautiful!

33:17.162 --> 33:18.371
Tops of your toes!
Ball high, ball high!

33:18.371 --> 33:20.207
Go! Stay tall, stay tall.

33:20.207 --> 33:21.208
Pump!

33:21.208 --> 33:22.292
Go!

33:22.334 --> 33:24.336
Nice pump.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.004
Nice!
Whoo!

33:27.047 --> 33:28.423
18‐yard, deep out,
okay?

33:28.465 --> 33:29.424
I can't hit that.

33:29.466 --> 33:30.842
He can't, he can't.

33:30.842 --> 33:33.178
(Saracen)
Half the players in college
can't even hit that route.

33:33.178 --> 33:34.179
Well, you can hit it.

33:34.221 --> 33:36.431
It's just an automatic six
for the other team.

33:36.473 --> 33:38.016
Coach doesn't even have it
in the playbook.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.184
Look at me and listen me.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.185
When you're doing your drop,

33:40.227 --> 33:41.770
you look off
the weak side safety.

33:41.811 --> 33:43.521
That means
you keep your head left.

33:43.521 --> 33:44.314
Okay?

33:44.356 --> 33:45.649
As soon as Riggins
makes his break,

33:45.690 --> 33:48.443
you need to open your body up
and you let the ball go.

33:48.485 --> 33:50.111
On the break,
high and outside.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.363
Any corner in this league's
gonna break on that,

33:51.363 --> 33:53.031
think he's got
a sure interception.

33:53.073 --> 33:54.532
But he doesn't because
you're putting the ball

33:54.532 --> 33:57.202
high and outside,
where only your man can get it.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.037
You hit the slants,
you hit the posts,

33:59.079 --> 34:00.080
they'll respect you.

34:00.080 --> 34:03.583
You hit this pattern,
they will fear you.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.210
Let me see you run it.

34:05.252 --> 34:07.462
Get on the line!

34:07.504 --> 34:09.130
You stay on the tops
of your toes.

34:09.172 --> 34:10.799
Set!
Hit!

34:10.840 --> 34:12.217
(Street)
That's right.
That's right.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.468
Flick him off.
Flick him off.

34:13.510 --> 34:14.469
Here comes the break.

34:14.511 --> 34:15.553
High and outside!

34:15.553 --> 34:18.306
High and outside!
High and outside!

34:18.348 --> 34:20.225
Whoo!

34:20.225 --> 34:21.142
There it is.

34:21.184 --> 34:22.227
I just hit it.

34:22.227 --> 34:24.020
Yes, you did.

34:31.403 --> 34:34.406
[overlapping chatter]

34:34.447 --> 34:38.410
So aren't we gonna go in?

34:38.451 --> 34:41.413
Mm‐mm.

34:41.413 --> 34:44.291
I wanna talk to you
about something.

34:44.291 --> 34:46.418
About you and Matt.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.752
Dad, I don't think‐‐

34:47.752 --> 34:50.046
Just hang on a second.
Let me finish, please.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.424
I know you two
are very close.

34:52.424 --> 34:55.093
And I know that
it's not easy on you,

34:55.135 --> 34:57.095
leaving this town.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.598
And I apologize to you

34:59.639 --> 35:01.433
for being insensitive
about that.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.226
I am sorry.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.604
Did Mom tell you
to say that?

35:05.645 --> 35:07.439
Nope, this is all mine.

35:07.480 --> 35:11.610
I also wanna say
that you are 15 years old.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.612
And you are not
gonna dictate

35:13.612 --> 35:15.113
where this family's
gonna live.

35:16.489 --> 35:19.451
But you are also
15 years old.

35:19.492 --> 35:22.621
And you also deserve
the respect,

35:22.662 --> 35:26.499
and you deserve to have
your opinion heard

35:26.541 --> 35:29.127
by both your mother
and myself.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.588
Do you really wanna know
my opinion?

35:31.630 --> 35:35.133
I do.

35:35.175 --> 35:39.638
My opinion is that
when you told me

35:39.679 --> 35:42.140
we were gonna move
to Dillon,

35:42.182 --> 35:44.809
I seriously wanted
to vomit.

35:44.809 --> 35:49.147
And my opinion
when we got here

35:49.189 --> 35:52.609
was that every fear
I had about moving...

35:52.651 --> 35:54.486
came true.

35:54.527 --> 35:58.657
And then...

35:58.657 --> 36:01.493
it changed.

36:01.534 --> 36:04.621
And I was actually happy.

36:07.707 --> 36:10.502
I've been moving around
my entire life.

36:10.543 --> 36:13.505
And...

36:13.505 --> 36:16.841
for the first time,

36:16.841 --> 36:20.679
it just felt
like I was at home.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.682
And I know going
to Austin

36:23.682 --> 36:27.811
and being some college
football coach is your dream.

36:28.895 --> 36:32.649
But I have dreams too.

36:32.691 --> 36:36.486
And they're coming true
right here.

36:37.404 --> 36:38.822
I hear you.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.663
So we should just go in
and get this over with.

36:46.705 --> 36:49.207
All right.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.552
[whispering]
I love you.

37:00.593 --> 37:01.886
[overlapping chatter]

37:01.886 --> 37:03.722
So honey,
just get anything you want.

37:03.763 --> 37:06.224
Like I said, it's on me,
so just get anything.

37:06.266 --> 37:07.559
I think I'm gonna get a big,
fat margarita

37:07.600 --> 37:09.352
and some ribs, I think,

37:09.394 --> 37:10.729
if somebody would just
come over here‐‐

37:10.729 --> 37:12.397
What the hell is the matter
with you?!

37:12.397 --> 37:14.399
Then I won't get ribs.
No, no!

37:14.399 --> 37:16.735
I'm talking about us.
I'm talking about me.

37:16.776 --> 37:18.403
The way that you acted
at the Taylor's,

37:18.403 --> 37:19.571
embarrassing me like that,

37:19.571 --> 37:20.697
what you said to me
in the car.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.240
What is going on
with you?

37:22.282 --> 37:23.408
I don't want to talk
about this right now.

37:23.450 --> 37:24.492
Well, I do.

37:24.534 --> 37:27.370
I wanna get outta here.
I wanna get outta here.

37:27.412 --> 37:29.622

I can't sit here

37:29.622 --> 37:30.957

flower things.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.459
I can't do it!

37:32.459 --> 37:33.752
Honey, let's just go.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.712
Let go!
I'm serious.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.257
I'm just saying.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.718
I just don't wanna feel like
you feel like

37:41.760 --> 37:43.261
you need to be something
that you're not.

37:43.303 --> 37:45.263
Well, I don't!
I don't feel that way!

37:45.305 --> 37:46.931
Mom, listen!

37:46.931 --> 37:49.601
Listen to me.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.603
I wanna try this,
okay?

37:51.644 --> 37:55.607
I wanna break the mold.
The Collette mold.

37:55.607 --> 37:56.941
I wanna go to college.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.610
I wanna have this life

37:58.651 --> 38:02.781
and I think I can.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.241
But I...

38:05.283 --> 38:06.951
I can't do any of it
without you.
