I'm one of those people who

never gets sick anyway.
>> What a liar.
>> Gumball: No, i just tell my

>> Oh, really?
And how do you do that?

14:59.633 --> 15:02.967

you're gonna have to take me to
the infirmary.

out of your arm for a while.

I can feel myself getting ill.
>> Hmm.
Like Monday, when you thought

15:40.140 --> 15:43.474
the foam in your mouth was
rabies, only to discover it was
toothpaste?

15:43.476 --> 15:47.478
Or Tuesday, when you thought you
broke your leg, even though you
don't have any bones?

15:47.480 --> 15:51.282
Or yesterday, when you thought
you'd gone deaf because nobody
had spoken to you for

Let me guess -- you found a

to science, and it's coming
after us.
>> Yes, exactly!

16:13.306 --> 16:16.708

What shall we do, Dr. Darwin?
>> Darwin: I recommend a

[ High-pitched chattering ]
Dude, she's right.

There's a virus.
And he's making rude gestures at
me with his little tentacles!

virus do you think it is?
>> Darwin: Let's read the

symptoms.
>> Oh, what's the point?
We'll never know which virus it

17:10.964 --> 17:14.365
is if it's always mutating.
They're the worst.
They always find a way to get
