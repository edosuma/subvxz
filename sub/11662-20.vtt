(tranquil music playing)

01:05.100 --> 01:07.533
Oh. Morning, Ma.

01:07.600 --> 01:11.100
Dorothy, when was the last time
you had sex?

01:17.233 --> 01:19.300
That's a very personal question.

01:19.367 --> 01:21.133
That long, huh?

01:23.433 --> 01:28.133
Perfect. You shall be the queen
of the festival of the dancing virgins.

01:28.767 --> 01:30.600
Ma, what are you talking about?

01:30.667 --> 01:32.033
Once a year,

01:32.100 --> 01:34.200
the women of my village
threw a festival

01:34.266 --> 01:36.433
to recapture their virginity.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.700
It gives you a chance
to say to the man in your life,

01:38.767 --> 01:41.033
"What kind of tramp
do you take me for?"

01:42.300 --> 01:47.266
We had a festival of the dancing
virgins in St. Olaf too.

01:47.333 --> 01:49.533
Every year, we'd go down
to the lake

01:49.600 --> 01:53.800
and they'd be flopping
around on the dock.

01:53.867 --> 01:58.800
No, wait, that was the festival
of the dancing sturgeons.

02:00.266 --> 02:03.567
What is wrong with you, woman?

02:04.834 --> 02:06.100
Okay, queenie.

02:07.433 --> 02:09.467
I have to make
salsa grandioso again.

02:09.533 --> 02:11.700
This time,
I'll teach you how.

02:11.767 --> 02:13.133
Not the sauce, Ma.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.900
No. That takes weeks.

02:14.967 --> 02:16.767
There are 152 ingredients.

02:16.834 --> 02:18.166
I just don't have the time.

02:18.233 --> 02:20.667
Dorothy, for 1400 years,

02:20.734 --> 02:23.433
the women in our family
have handed this recipe down

02:23.500 --> 02:24.567
from mother to daughter.

02:24.633 --> 02:27.967
Each generation improves upon it
in some way.

02:28.033 --> 02:29.066
Like, for instance,

02:29.133 --> 02:31.867
it was my great-grandmother
who added heat.

02:39.867 --> 02:41.467
What did you add, Sophia?

02:41.533 --> 02:43.000
A mouthful of wine.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.867
It was an accident.

02:48.300 --> 02:50.700
A delicious accident.

02:50.767 --> 02:52.967
I just can't do it now.

02:53.033 --> 02:55.467
I'll be teaching
that honors program class,

02:55.533 --> 02:57.133
and it will be
a challenge.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.633
I'll have students
who know

02:58.700 --> 03:01.934
that Chekhov is a brilliant
Russian playwright,

03:02.000 --> 03:05.600
not the guy who was the navigator
on the <i>Enterprise.</i>

03:06.633 --> 03:10.166
I didn't know the guy
from <i>Star Trek </i>wrote plays.

03:11.967 --> 03:15.967
So, Dorothy, am I going to take
this recipe with me to the grave?

03:16.033 --> 03:17.767
Right along with the secret

03:17.834 --> 03:21.567
of why uncle Gino
legally adopted that goat.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.767
Sophia, why don't you
teach me the recipe?

03:26.834 --> 03:28.233
I'm practically
your daughter.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.033
'Cause you have to hand it down
to a blood relative

03:30.100 --> 03:31.767
or the queen of the festival.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.767
When was the last time you had sex?

03:37.100 --> 03:39.400
A couple of weeks ago.

03:40.367 --> 03:41.667
Let's not split hairs.

03:41.734 --> 03:44.433
Congratulations. You're the queen.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.700
I'm the queen?

03:48.533 --> 03:49.967
You're also the fool,

03:50.033 --> 03:52.867
so we're saving a lot on payroll.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.200
Leave her alone.

03:55.266 --> 03:56.767
We have to get to work
on the sauce.

03:56.834 --> 03:59.533
We begin by taking a shallow bath
in olive oil

03:59.600 --> 04:03.266
at 7:34 Sicily time.

04:03.333 --> 04:04.066
Why?

04:04.133 --> 04:05.967
Originally it was to keep
the visigoths away.

04:06.033 --> 04:08.800
But if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.400
(sighs)

04:15.700 --> 04:17.100
Am I convincing?

04:20.967 --> 04:23.567
As what, ye olde towne slut?

04:26.066 --> 04:28.367
It so happens
our community playhouse

04:28.433 --> 04:30.700
is doing <i>The Taming of the Shrew,</i>

04:30.767 --> 04:32.633
and I'm auditioning
for the role of Kate,

04:32.700 --> 04:36.166
the fiery tart of Padua
who no man could tame.

04:36.233 --> 04:37.633
(doorbell chimes)

04:37.700 --> 04:41.333
Hark. Perhaps a suitor
doth approacheth.

04:42.567 --> 04:45.767
You think he'll thtay all night?

04:50.533 --> 04:53.166
Oh, Rebecca. What a surprise.

04:53.233 --> 04:54.333
(Rebecca) Look at you.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.266
And you used to yell at me
for wearing halter tops.

04:59.533 --> 05:04.066
Mama, I got a job interview,
and I need you to baby-sit for Aurora.

05:04.133 --> 05:07.300
Aurora? I just hate that name.

05:07.367 --> 05:09.633
Why couldn't you have found
something more musical,

05:09.700 --> 05:12.166
more southern, more beautiful?

05:12.233 --> 05:14.000
Sorry, <i>Blanche.</i>

05:17.400 --> 05:19.300
Look. I know you don't like the name,

05:19.367 --> 05:21.633
and I know you think
I'm bringing her up wrong.

05:21.700 --> 05:24.033
No. I just don't see
why you feed her

05:24.100 --> 05:25.800
when you visit me at the museum.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.800
You don't see me
taking out my breast in public.

05:36.700 --> 05:37.900
A lot.

05:40.333 --> 05:44.166
I'd love to stay and argue with you,
but I have to go.

05:44.233 --> 05:48.300
You know how much I want
to be with Oreo, but...

05:48.367 --> 05:50.967
Aurora, Mama. Aurora.

05:51.033 --> 05:53.300
I know. I just have such a block
against that name.

05:53.367 --> 05:56.133
You promised if I moved to Miami,
you'd help me out,

05:56.200 --> 05:59.567
and I really need this job.

05:59.633 --> 06:02.033
You have a good time with grandma.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.533
Rebecca!

06:03.600 --> 06:04.867
You stop saying that.

06:04.934 --> 06:08.600
You keep calling me grandma,
she'll grow up thinking that's my name.

06:13.667 --> 06:16.600
Yours if you talk of tales.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.700
And so farewell.

06:18.767 --> 06:19.667
(man) Thank you.

06:19.734 --> 06:21.934
Would you like to see
Kate another way?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.500
(Man) God, yes.

06:23.567 --> 06:24.700
Next!

06:26.266 --> 06:27.467
Blanche Devereaux.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.433
Hi.

06:36.500 --> 06:37.800
Larry, is that you?

06:37.867 --> 06:39.734
No. Larry's not directing this one.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.066
He's sick.

06:41.133 --> 06:43.500
His back didn't go out again, did it?

06:44.533 --> 06:45.567
How did you know?

06:46.667 --> 06:49.200
I performed <i>Annie </i>for him.

06:49.266 --> 06:51.300
Really? Where?

06:51.367 --> 06:52.867
None of your business.

06:55.500 --> 06:56.767
Okay.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.734
Jason will be your Petruchio.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.567
Page 85.

07:00.633 --> 07:04.200
Myself am moved
to woo thee for my wife.

07:04.266 --> 07:06.266
Moved? In good time,

07:06.333 --> 07:09.066
let him that moved you hither
move you hence.

07:09.133 --> 07:10.734
(baby cries)

07:10.800 --> 07:12.266
Oh. Shh. Shh.

07:12.333 --> 07:14.734
I knew you at the first.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.233
You were a movable.

07:16.300 --> 07:17.734
Thou hast hit it.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.400
Come. Sit on me.

07:20.467 --> 07:21.700
Ooh.

07:21.767 --> 07:23.333
Oh.

07:27.233 --> 07:29.834
Asses are made to bear,
and so are you.

07:29.900 --> 07:31.166
(baby cries)

07:31.800 --> 07:35.033
Women are made to bear,
and so are you.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.300
Shh, shh, shh.

07:36.367 --> 07:39.000
No such jade as you,

07:39.066 --> 07:40.367
if me you mean.

07:40.433 --> 07:45.033
(man) Okay. I've heard enough.
Thank you.

07:45.100 --> 07:48.333
Oh, please. I've waited
my whole life

07:48.400 --> 07:49.900
to play this part.

07:49.967 --> 07:51.333
Long wait.

07:53.367 --> 07:55.734
Thank you, Miss Devereaux.
Let's take a five.

07:55.800 --> 07:56.967
Oh. Shoot.

07:59.433 --> 08:01.333
Well, I thought you were great.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.700
Oh. Well, uh...

08:03.767 --> 08:05.834
I was born to act.

08:05.900 --> 08:09.166
I've given some of my best performances
on the stage.

08:10.266 --> 08:11.700
And what about this little lady?

08:11.767 --> 08:13.633
I bet her daddy's very proud of her.

08:13.700 --> 08:16.600
She doesn't have a daddy.
Do you, sweetheart?

08:16.667 --> 08:19.533
Really? Well, her mother's
very talented.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.734
How do you know?

08:20.800 --> 08:22.033
I just saw her act.

08:22.100 --> 08:23.066
Oh.

08:26.567 --> 08:29.667
Oh. Oh.

08:31.934 --> 08:33.066
And your name was?

08:33.133 --> 08:34.333
Jason Stillman.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.967
-Did you see <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's?</i>
-Yes.

08:37.033 --> 08:39.100
Well, I was in the party scene,

08:39.166 --> 08:41.567
Audrey Hepburn spilled a drink on me,

08:41.633 --> 08:43.700
but they cut it out.

08:43.767 --> 08:45.233
I'm impressed.

08:45.300 --> 08:47.800
I've settled here in Florida recently.

08:47.867 --> 08:50.233
Maybe you... and your daughter

08:50.300 --> 08:52.834
could join me for an afternoon
at the zoo one day.

08:54.567 --> 08:58.300
My...daughter and I
would love that.

08:58.367 --> 09:00.233
Well, I'll call you.

09:00.300 --> 09:01.367
Are you in the book?

09:01.433 --> 09:02.900
Bold print.

09:06.233 --> 09:08.700
(serene music playing)

09:10.133 --> 09:11.667
Hi, pussycat.
How was school?

09:11.734 --> 09:13.934
Oh, I hate those smart kids.

09:15.333 --> 09:18.166
They may be our brightest,
but they're also our rudest,

09:18.233 --> 09:21.166
considering most of them
are guests in our country.

09:23.333 --> 09:27.700
Oh, give me a class
of red-blooded underachievers.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.300
Pussycat, in junior high school,

09:31.367 --> 09:32.767
when the kids gave you a hard time,

09:32.834 --> 09:33.734
what did I say?

09:33.800 --> 09:37.667
That I was extra special
and they were just jealous.

09:37.734 --> 09:41.467
And if they still gave you
a hard time?

09:41.533 --> 09:45.600
My mother can have you eliminated
with one phone call.

09:48.433 --> 09:50.066
But this is different.

09:50.133 --> 09:52.333
I've always wanted
to teach an honors class,

09:52.400 --> 09:55.567
but the kids
are making me feel stupid.

09:56.633 --> 09:59.033
Dorothy, I'm going
to tell you something

09:59.100 --> 10:00.433
I never told you before.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.467
When you were about 12,

10:03.533 --> 10:07.166
they told me at school you had the
highest IQ in the borough.

10:07.233 --> 10:08.834
That's a coincidence.

10:08.900 --> 10:12.433
I was told I had the IQ of a burro.

10:19.033 --> 10:20.667
Ma, I had no idea.

10:20.734 --> 10:23.233
The brightest kid in Brooklyn?

10:23.300 --> 10:25.500
Well, that certainly
explains the feeling

10:25.567 --> 10:28.934
of being right all the time.

10:29.000 --> 10:29.934
What is it?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.467
173.

10:32.533 --> 10:34.266
I don't know if you know this,

10:34.333 --> 10:37.800
but a burro can
find his way back home.

10:40.567 --> 10:42.567
Have fun shopping, Rose.

10:42.633 --> 10:44.533
Oh, I'll be back.

10:53.166 --> 10:55.467
What crossword puzzle
are you doing?

10:55.533 --> 10:57.900
Sunday <i>New York Times.</i>

10:59.734 --> 11:00.934
In ink.

11:05.133 --> 11:06.934
Isn't Rebecca here
with the baby yet?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.400
She called. She'll be late.

11:09.467 --> 11:11.967
It's so nice

11:12.033 --> 11:14.066
to see you take this much
of an interest

11:14.133 --> 11:15.300
in your granddaughter.

11:15.367 --> 11:18.433
Well, I have to.
Jason thinks the baby's mine.

11:22.300 --> 11:24.633
Don't look at me that way.

11:24.700 --> 11:26.734
He thought the baby was mine.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.867
I just didn't correct him.

11:28.934 --> 11:30.266
Well, it's not a lie.

11:30.333 --> 11:33.266
(stammering) I'm just
withholding the truth.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.500
How could you do that?

11:36.567 --> 11:39.800
Because I've really
gotten to like him.

11:39.867 --> 11:43.300
If I tell the truth now,
he'll think I'm a liar.

11:43.367 --> 11:45.734
Oh, what a tangled web
we weave

11:45.800 --> 11:48.734
when first we practice to tell a fib.

11:52.333 --> 11:54.400
Walt Whitman here has a point.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.467
What's with this guy?

11:57.533 --> 12:00.667
He must be blind as a bat.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.834
There are lots of ways
you can trick a man

12:03.900 --> 12:06.533
into thinking you're younger
than you really are.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.166
Wear sunglasses, wear extra make-up,

12:09.233 --> 12:10.633
go to dimly lit restaurants.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.166
We've all done that.

12:12.233 --> 12:15.100
Fly to Nevada to get
a fake birth certificate.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.767
Have a phony high school yearbook
printed up.

12:18.834 --> 12:21.967
Change the dates on your parents' graves.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.633
We've all done that.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.133
(doorbell chimes)

12:28.200 --> 12:30.000
What if that's Jason?

12:30.066 --> 12:31.467
Listen. I'm warning you.

12:31.533 --> 12:33.133
If anybody blows
the whistle on me,

12:33.200 --> 12:34.900
the old lady's out on the street.

12:43.400 --> 12:47.667
Rose, go in the other room
and cry like a baby.

12:47.734 --> 12:49.500
She owns us.

12:57.567 --> 12:58.600
Oh, Jason.

12:58.667 --> 13:01.300
Blanche, thank you again
for these ray-blockers.

13:01.367 --> 13:03.166
I didn't think I'd get used to
everything being pink,

13:03.233 --> 13:04.500
but it's fun.

13:06.066 --> 13:07.800
We ought to be going.

13:07.867 --> 13:10.166
Alligator grotto's
been there 1,000 years.

13:10.233 --> 13:11.700
It can wait another few minutes.

13:11.767 --> 13:12.967
Good afternoon, ladies.

13:13.033 --> 13:15.033
Take your glasses off
and stay a while.

13:15.100 --> 13:18.066
-No. Got to go.
-Where's the baby?

13:18.133 --> 13:19.900
The baby's sleeping.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.567
Let me take a peek.

13:21.633 --> 13:25.533
At the greater Miami
baby sleep center.

13:26.633 --> 13:30.500
It's sort of a flophouse for infants.

13:30.567 --> 13:32.200
(doorbell chimes)

13:32.266 --> 13:35.934
That must be the baby
and her nanny now.

13:36.800 --> 13:37.567
Hi, everyone.

13:37.633 --> 13:40.700
Sorry I'm late.
Guess what happened today.

13:40.767 --> 13:43.333
Later. Give me the baby and leave.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.133
She said, "Mama."

13:45.200 --> 13:46.200
Aw.

13:46.266 --> 13:47.967
Too bad, Blanche,
you weren't there.

13:48.033 --> 13:51.200
Yeah. Too bad,
but I'm sure she'll say it again.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.600
-Okay. Let's go.
-Wait.

13:57.667 --> 13:59.266
Let me get a picture.

13:59.333 --> 14:03.934
(Jason) Isn't she the most beautiful
mother you've ever seen?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.200
Grand.

14:05.266 --> 14:07.166
Just gran.

14:16.033 --> 14:17.333
(click)

14:17.400 --> 14:18.700
You know, Blanche.

14:18.767 --> 14:20.800
This is like a perfect family.

14:20.867 --> 14:22.834
Well, almost perfect.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.967
Maybe someday there
will be room for me.

14:25.033 --> 14:26.367
And who knows?

14:26.433 --> 14:28.200
Maybe even a little one of our own.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.233
And a pinch of red pepper.

14:49.300 --> 14:50.533
That's not a pinch.

14:50.600 --> 14:51.800
You ever get pinched by an Italian?

14:51.867 --> 14:54.200
It takes about five minutes.

14:56.333 --> 14:57.533
Hi.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.834
What are you doing up?

14:58.900 --> 15:00.367
You have school tomorrow.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.500
I'm just too smart for my own good.

15:02.567 --> 15:05.000
I feel as trapped and isolated

15:05.066 --> 15:08.333
as Soren Kierkegaard
in his final days.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.066
(laughs)

15:13.266 --> 15:14.500
What?

15:14.567 --> 15:17.600
Well, that's such a funny name.

15:17.667 --> 15:18.800
Oh, Rose.

15:18.867 --> 15:24.700
Dear, sweet, single-digit-IQ Rose.

15:27.033 --> 15:29.667
I've been tossing and turning.
I can't sleep.

15:29.734 --> 15:32.033
I don't know what I'll do about Jason.

15:32.100 --> 15:35.400
He's anxious to settle down.

15:35.467 --> 15:37.834
He wants us to have
another child right away.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.800
Well, frankly, I don't know
if I want another baby so soon.

15:47.834 --> 15:49.467
I understand.

15:49.533 --> 15:53.433
Wait a couple years
and Medicare will pay for it.

16:01.934 --> 16:04.734
Why wait? Have it now,
and the <i>Enquirer </i>will pay for it.

16:15.233 --> 16:17.400
It's so unfair.

16:17.467 --> 16:19.066
We're both about the same age.

16:19.133 --> 16:21.867
He can go on making babies
the rest of his life.

16:21.934 --> 16:24.734
I feel like the Spruce Goose.

16:26.934 --> 16:29.300
People may visit,
play with the controls,

16:29.367 --> 16:31.767
but I'll never really fly again.

16:37.133 --> 16:38.667
(doorbell chimes)

16:41.300 --> 16:43.333
-Hello.
-Hi.

16:43.400 --> 16:46.600
And how is little Aurora today?

16:46.667 --> 16:49.767
Oh, what a good girl she was.

16:49.834 --> 16:53.967
She was just smiling,
smiling and smiling.

16:54.033 --> 16:57.600
I know sometimes it's just gas
but she was so cute.

17:15.967 --> 17:18.734
Ma, it's not cute once you pass 80.

17:22.600 --> 17:25.333
Oh, I thought I heard company.

17:25.400 --> 17:28.066
-Come here, you.
-Aurora just got up,

17:28.133 --> 17:31.066
so she may not take a nap
this afternoon.

17:31.133 --> 17:34.400
Oh, that's all right.
I enjoy it when she's awake.

17:34.467 --> 17:37.000
Mother, this is so unlike you.

17:37.066 --> 17:38.900
You've never really liked babies.

17:38.967 --> 17:41.133
Rebecca, go home.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.233
You're interfering in mine
and the baby's bonding time.

17:44.300 --> 17:45.700
Before I go,

17:45.767 --> 17:47.900
I just want to say it's been wonderful

17:48.000 --> 17:51.166
seeing the open, honest,
and loving relationship

17:51.233 --> 17:53.266
you're having with Aurora.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.767
You've been great.

17:55.767 --> 17:57.033
I love you, Mama.

17:59.433 --> 18:00.633
Wait.

18:01.467 --> 18:04.367
I'm not as perfect as you think I am.
Just wanted you to know.

18:04.433 --> 18:06.133
(doorbell chimes)

18:08.166 --> 18:10.367
Hi. I hope I'm not too early.

18:10.433 --> 18:13.000
You're right on time.
There's something I wanna tell you.

18:13.800 --> 18:17.000
I'm not the baby's mother.
I'm her grandmother.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.166
I don't believe this.

18:23.233 --> 18:25.333
I should have told you sooner,
but when we met,

18:25.400 --> 18:27.033
I was very attracted to you.

18:27.100 --> 18:30.467
(stammering) I couldn't believe you
thought I was the baby's mother.

18:30.533 --> 18:34.367
-What were you thinking of?
-Well, I thought, "Who am I to judge?"

18:34.433 --> 18:36.066
I was bald at 23.

18:39.100 --> 18:41.967
Well, I guess this ends our relationship.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.967
You probably don't want to go out
with a grandmother.

18:44.033 --> 18:46.900
No. I'd go out with a grandmother.

18:46.967 --> 18:49.166
I don't want to go out
with someone I can't trust.

18:50.900 --> 18:52.133
Goodbye, Blanche.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.200
Well, that's that.

18:58.266 --> 19:00.233
No use crying.

19:00.300 --> 19:01.767
Shall we take
the baby to the park?

19:01.834 --> 19:05.367
Why? So you can pick
someone else up?

19:05.433 --> 19:07.500
I really thought you were getting
to love Aurora,

19:07.567 --> 19:11.600
but you were just using her
to land a man.

19:11.667 --> 19:15.000
Goodbye, Mama.
Thanks for babysitting.

19:15.066 --> 19:17.333
You won't have to do it again.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.467
(door slams)

19:26.667 --> 19:29.834
Good. You're home for the festival.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.667
The sauce is almost ready.

19:31.734 --> 19:33.800
I'm not staying for dinner.

19:33.867 --> 19:36.066
There's a meeting at Mensa.

19:36.133 --> 19:39.200
That's the organization for people
with high IQs like mine.

19:39.266 --> 19:42.266
In St. Olaf, we had a chapter of Mensa,

19:42.333 --> 19:44.633
and across the room was Girlsa.

19:47.266 --> 19:49.333
No, wait. Those were the bathrooms

19:49.400 --> 19:51.900
at St. Olaf's only Italian restaurant.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.567
Hold it, Dorothy.

19:54.633 --> 19:56.900
Not stay for dinner?
Not stay for the sauce?

19:56.967 --> 19:58.700
Miss the whole festival?

19:58.767 --> 20:00.767
Where's your sense of family,
of tradition?

20:00.834 --> 20:04.734
I just want to be around
my intellectual peers.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.967
Bad news, pussycat. You are.

20:07.033 --> 20:08.700
I made up your IQ.

20:08.767 --> 20:12.166
I wasn't the brightest kid
in Brooklyn?

20:12.233 --> 20:15.166
So I lied. Did it help you get
along with your honors class?

20:15.233 --> 20:18.567
Yes, but you lied to me.

20:18.633 --> 20:21.166
Tooth fairy. Santa Claus.
Easter bunny.

20:21.233 --> 20:23.734
I've been messing with your head
for over 60 years.

20:28.934 --> 20:32.900
I guess you don't feel
like Sorden Kirbeardeebarden now.

20:32.967 --> 20:36.033
That's Soren Kierkegaard.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.633
I got her to say it again.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.300
-What's going on?
-Oh, good. A trollop.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.100
Everybody, grab a rock.

20:47.567 --> 20:49.800
Go on. Throw them.
I don't care anymore.

20:49.867 --> 20:51.266
Oh, honey.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.900
You're still that upset about Jason?

20:54.533 --> 20:56.333
I'm not upset about him.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.900
I would never get that upset
about a man.

20:59.967 --> 21:03.767
Rebecca called, asked if she could come
get the baby's things.

21:03.834 --> 21:05.633
I asked her if we could talk.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.000
She said we have
nothing to talk about.

21:08.066 --> 21:10.533
We have so much to talk about.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.100
The trouble is, we always end up fighting.

21:13.166 --> 21:15.300
Look who's here.

21:15.367 --> 21:17.900
Sophia, see if you can get them
to stay for dinner.

21:17.967 --> 21:21.367
No, thank you.
I'm here to pick up a few things.

21:21.433 --> 21:23.033
There's plenty of food.

21:23.100 --> 21:24.700
Thank you anyway.

21:25.467 --> 21:26.900
I'll get the baby's things.

21:29.567 --> 21:32.867
Come on. It's 6:30. We're already
five minutes behind schedule.

21:32.934 --> 21:36.266
Rose, before you bring in the sauce,
tell us what ingredient you added.

21:36.333 --> 21:39.033
I don't want to spoil the surprise.

21:39.100 --> 21:40.867
I'll give you a hint.

21:40.934 --> 21:44.033
They're sugary and they're great!

21:50.734 --> 21:54.867
Dorothy, you'll have to do
the dance of the virgins by yourself.

21:54.934 --> 21:56.133
Ma.

21:56.200 --> 21:58.066
It's like the bunny hop,

21:58.133 --> 22:00.400
except you keep
your legs crossed.

22:01.533 --> 22:03.100
Ma, you're making this up.

22:03.166 --> 22:04.734
I'm adding to it.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.934
Once every year, the women of my family
got together.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.200
They danced, they laughed, they ate.

22:11.266 --> 22:13.767
It was a celebration of mothers
and daughters.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.967
Don't turn your back
on your mother, Rebecca.

22:18.033 --> 22:20.734
Don't let your little girl
grow up without a grandmother.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.567
I'm 85, and I still cherish
all the memories

22:23.633 --> 22:25.633
that I had with mine.

22:28.066 --> 22:29.967
I think I've got everything.

22:31.700 --> 22:33.433
Can I kiss Aurora goodbye?

22:34.500 --> 22:35.467
No.

22:36.100 --> 22:37.467
No?

22:37.533 --> 22:39.533
We're not going anywhere.

22:41.033 --> 22:43.533
(groans) Give me that baby.

22:45.166 --> 22:46.934
Aw.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.100
On with the feast.

22:49.166 --> 22:52.700
Oh, Ma, I may not
have an IQ of 173,

22:52.767 --> 22:54.367
but I know what you mean

22:54.433 --> 22:57.300
by continuity and family.

22:57.367 --> 23:00.867
And next year,
I want to learn the sauce.

23:00.934 --> 23:03.000
Deal, pussycat.
It's not that hard.

23:03.066 --> 23:05.867
You get one large pot,
12 plum tomatoes,

23:05.934 --> 23:08.300
and one moron to do
all the work for you.

23:18.700 --> 23:22.233
(theme music playing)
