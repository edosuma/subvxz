00:10.120 --> 00:11.760
SHE LAUGHS

00:11.760 --> 00:15.600
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Mrs Brown's Boys!

00:15.600 --> 00:18.720
# She's Mrs Brown
Agnes

00:18.720 --> 00:21.520
# That's Mrs Brown
Agnes

00:21.520 --> 00:24.200
# Our Mrs Brown. #

00:26.680 --> 00:30.520
"For sale, set of encyclopedias.

00:30.520 --> 00:34.520
"No longer needed as I married a
man who knows every feckin' thing."

00:37.440 --> 00:40.520
Hello, Winnie! Cup of tea?

00:40.520 --> 00:42.520
No, I'm grand, love.

00:42.520 --> 00:45.680
What's wrong with you?
It's Sharon. She's depressed.

00:45.680 --> 00:48.880
With all the boyfriends she has,
she has no date for Valentine's Day.

00:48.880 --> 00:49.960
Ah.

00:49.960 --> 00:53.360
They're probably all going out
with their wives!

00:53.360 --> 00:55.880
Agnes, what do you do
when you're blue?

00:55.880 --> 00:57.480
I start breathing again.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.600
Are you sure you don't want a cuppa?

01:01.600 --> 01:04.400
No. I'm heading down the shops
to get a Valentine's Day card.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.440
For who?

01:05.440 --> 01:07.880
For Jacko, of course!

01:07.880 --> 01:09.920
Do you want anything
while I'm down there?

01:09.920 --> 01:12.120
No, Valentine's Day, my arse!

01:12.120 --> 01:15.440
Redser asked me one year what I'd
like getting for Valentine's Day.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.720
I said, "Get me
something with diamonds".

01:17.720 --> 01:20.240
And he got me
a deck of fuckin' cards!

01:23.040 --> 01:25.120
Hello, Mrs Brown. Hello, Winnie.

01:25.120 --> 01:27.240
Hello, Betty.
To what do we owe the honour?

01:27.240 --> 01:31.480
Just a quick visit.
I thought so, that's why you
didn't wash your hair.

01:31.480 --> 01:35.400
Cathy was trying to get a book for
me. Is she about? She's inside.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.720
Any word from the Australian
embassy about their emigration?

01:38.720 --> 01:40.840
No, apparently it takes a while.

01:40.840 --> 01:44.360
Course it does. Sure it's
on the other side of the world.

01:48.920 --> 01:51.640
Winnie, are you not a bit
old for this Valentine malarkey?

01:51.640 --> 01:54.520
You're never too
old for romance, Agnes.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.760
I get the card every year.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.800
And on the night,
I wear kinky underwear.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.400
Well, that's me off me
fuckin' dinner!

02:06.400 --> 02:07.880
Which reminds me,

02:07.880 --> 02:11.120
I must get that underwear
back from me cousin.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.040
Your cousin's a priest!

02:16.720 --> 02:18.200
Don't get me started!

02:20.400 --> 02:22.520
Who was that? Winnie.

02:22.520 --> 02:25.000
She's gone down the shops to get
a Valentine before Sharon

02:25.000 --> 02:26.480
buys them all up.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.160
I'll get you a cup of tea, love.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.840
Oh, Jesus! You a bit stiff?

02:30.840 --> 02:33.160
I'm a bit old.
Missed the gym again?

02:33.160 --> 02:34.880
Yes, that's ten years in a row.

02:36.960 --> 02:40.320
What's the book, Betty?
It's The ABC Of Sex.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.400
A, B AND C?

02:42.680 --> 02:44.920
Three positions?

02:44.920 --> 02:47.640
Bono's getting to the age where
he's starting to ask questions,

02:47.640 --> 02:49.080
so I want to be ready.

02:49.080 --> 02:51.360
There was no book to tell me
what to do in my day.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.200
Well, it's all changed
since your day.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.640
Yes, it has, Mammy.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.800
If you were going on
a first date nowadays,

02:56.800 --> 02:59.080
a man would expect you
to perform fellatio.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.240
Me? Sing opera?

03:08.760 --> 03:11.600
He'd have a better chance
of getting a blowjob!

03:14.160 --> 03:15.400
Right, I'm off.

03:15.400 --> 03:18.160
I'll drop this book back
to you at the weekend, Cathy.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.720
No problem.

03:23.480 --> 03:27.200
Mammy, have you thought
about losing a few pounds?

03:27.200 --> 03:29.240
You are...plumping up a bit.

03:31.680 --> 03:35.120
You should enter that competition
in the newspaper. What's it called?

03:35.120 --> 03:38.480
Oh, the mind your own
fuckin' business competition!

03:38.480 --> 03:40.200
I think you'd do very well in that.

03:40.200 --> 03:43.560
All I'm saying is fat
is not good for ya.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.640
This is not fat, Cathy.

03:45.640 --> 03:49.000
This is from all the years
of carrying this family on my back.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.320
This is mother's muscle.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.360
Oh, I see. Yes.

03:53.360 --> 03:56.640
Oh, when I married your father, the
two of us were as skinny as sticks.

03:56.640 --> 03:59.320
It was a wonder we didn't start
a fire when we went at it.

04:03.360 --> 04:04.680
TMI.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.080
Teemy what? Too much information.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.640
KYBCTY.

04:10.480 --> 04:11.880
No, don't get it.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.680
Keep your buckin'
comments to yourself!

04:16.280 --> 04:18.480
You never wear
that lavender dress any more

04:18.480 --> 04:20.560
and it used to be your favourite.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.720
Lavender... I don't remember.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.000
Yes, you do. It's up in your wardrobe

04:25.000 --> 04:27.560
and you don't wear it cos it
doesn't fit ya any more.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.840
It shrunk in the wash.
No, it didn't! It did, too!

04:30.840 --> 04:34.680
All I'll say is, take that dress out
and take a good look at it

04:34.680 --> 04:37.320
and remember how good
you used to look in it.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.520
I'll see ya later.

04:39.520 --> 04:43.120
You mightn't recognise me,
after I've finished me exercises.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.240
Really? Yes.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.040
That's enough of that!

05:03.200 --> 05:05.040
Tried on that lavender dress today.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.800
And? I got the zip halfway up.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.080
It was like a straight jacket on me.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.800
I was right, it shrunk.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.640
It didn't shrink.

05:15.640 --> 05:19.400
Look, all you have to do
is even take a walk every day.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.040
Say, two miles.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.120
Two feckin' miles?!

05:23.120 --> 05:25.240
Yes! You can do it.

05:25.240 --> 05:29.400
Just walk two miles every day
and in a month I bet you'll be in...

05:29.400 --> 05:30.840
Kildare.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.400
..great shape.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.160
Thanks, Sharon.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.400
Sharon, I believe you've
no date for Valentine's.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.000
Nah, but I'll be all right.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.800
That's the girl, be confident!

05:41.800 --> 05:43.880
I am. Watch this...

05:43.880 --> 05:45.640
Heyare!

05:45.640 --> 05:48.040
Whoever can guess what's
in this bag can have sex with me

05:48.040 --> 05:49.240
on Valentine's night.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.880
A giraffe!

05:52.040 --> 05:53.520
Close enough.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.520
Hello, Winnie.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.280
You just missed Sharon getting
a date for Valentine's night.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.440
Oh, I'm glad. Who is it?

06:04.440 --> 06:07.000
That skinny little fellow
over there. Oh, right.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.520
You'd better tie a plank across his
arse or we'll never see him again.

06:10.520 --> 06:11.880
Mammy! Sorry.

06:13.480 --> 06:17.720
Here, Winnie, the jackpot
at the bingo's going to be
2,000 euro on the 14th.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.680
We'll have a good night that night.
On the 14th, Agnes?

06:20.680 --> 06:22.680
Yeah. I can't go with ya
on the 14th.

06:22.680 --> 06:26.360
That's Valentine's night
and Jacko's taking me out.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.520
Excuse me.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.680
You'll have to go on your own, pet.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.120
Jacko's taking me into town
for tea and biscuits.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.280
For feck's sake!

06:34.280 --> 06:36.520
I'm so looking forward to it.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.360
I've never given blood before.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.040
Just as well it's not
a four-course meal.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.560
Might have cost you
a fuckin' kidney.

06:54.480 --> 06:58.320
Valentine's Day, it's making me
laugh. Even Grandad has a date.

06:58.320 --> 07:01.840
That's it, Mammy.
That's the goal you need.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.840
I need a goal?
Now who am I, David Beckham?

07:04.840 --> 07:07.520
You should have a date
for Valentine's night.

07:07.520 --> 07:11.160
And your goal would be to fit
into that lavender dress by then.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.840
That's a great idea, Cathy.

07:12.840 --> 07:16.680
It's all right for you, Winnie, you
have man. Even if he's in
and out of hospital all the time.

07:16.680 --> 07:19.400
Where would I get a feckin' date?

07:19.400 --> 07:20.760
Off the internet.

07:20.760 --> 07:24.160
Jesus, no, Cathy. With my luck
I'd end up with a buckin' virus.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.960
My cousin got a thing
off the internet

07:31.960 --> 07:33.600
and the legs were all bandy.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.040
She got a date with someone
with bandy legs?

07:36.040 --> 07:38.560
No, it was a coffee table!

07:40.480 --> 07:42.040
I'll arrange it and all.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.760
I'll just put your photo on the net
and we'll see what happens.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.800
If you get any offers, you can pick
the one you want to go out with.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.480
You might get a man
like Jacko off the internet!

07:50.480 --> 07:52.000
SHE LAUGHS

07:52.000 --> 07:55.200
You wouldn't get a man like Jacko
with a fuckin' fishing net.

07:58.240 --> 08:01.280
I think it's a great idea -
Mrs Brown going on a date.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.160
Well, I don't.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.360
We're talking about our mammy here.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.200
Mammy...on a date?

08:07.200 --> 08:10.080
No way, Cathy,
Mammy can't go on a date.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.480
It's...not normal.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.040
MRS BROWN SNIGGERS

08:17.040 --> 08:20.360
You could do with
clipping your shaft.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.560
Oh, Winnie, I see
you've found Betty's book.

08:27.560 --> 08:30.320
It's amazing what you can do with
a bicycle pump and a Kit Kat.

08:31.960 --> 08:35.200
There's a man in here holding
a woman like a wheelbarrow.

08:36.920 --> 08:38.440
Go on a couple of pages,

08:38.440 --> 08:41.520
there's a woman holding a man
like a one-armed bandit!

08:43.480 --> 08:46.000
And she's going for
the buckin' jackpot!

08:51.360 --> 08:54.880
Can you imagine me doing that feckin
wheelbarrow thing with Redser?

08:57.360 --> 09:00.880
"Slow down, slow down!
Take a left at the next lights!"

09:02.240 --> 09:05.800
"Oh, Jesus, don't
go past me mother's!"

09:05.800 --> 09:09.040
It's just not right.
And why not?

09:09.040 --> 09:11.480
Because...she can't!

09:11.480 --> 09:13.760
Mammies don't go on dates.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.840
They... They play bingo.

09:16.840 --> 09:19.000
Well, excuse me, Dermot,

09:19.000 --> 09:22.800
but Mammy is a person and a woman
and a woman has needs.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.120
Well, excuse me,
the whole lot of you.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.480
Now, Cathy, I haven't decided
one way or the other yet,

09:27.480 --> 09:29.600
so there's nothing definite.

09:29.600 --> 09:32.360
And you, son,
if I do decide to go on a date,

09:32.360 --> 09:34.480
I wont be waiting
on your permission.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.760
Even Grandad has a date.

09:37.760 --> 09:40.440
That's Mammy's fault.
She's given him Viagra.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.880
You're giving Grandad Viagra, Mammy?

09:44.880 --> 09:46.560
Yes. Why would you do that?

09:46.560 --> 09:49.640
Buster said it would stop him
pissing on his slippers.

09:53.440 --> 09:56.000
Did it work? Kind of.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.640
His slippers are dry.

09:59.320 --> 10:02.200
He's pissing on
the buckin' ceiling now!

10:49.560 --> 10:53.360
Grandad, what did I say about
these tablets? And I meant it!

10:53.360 --> 10:54.600
Cut down on these now.

10:56.040 --> 11:00.480
I went in to call you in your room
this morning, your bed was
like a fuckin' tent!

11:02.560 --> 11:04.400
I mean it! Cut down!

11:04.400 --> 11:06.800
Or I'm make you mop
that ceiling yourself.

11:11.160 --> 11:12.640
Wait a minute.

11:14.120 --> 11:17.440
I could have a go at this
computer thing myself.

11:17.440 --> 11:20.280
I'm sure I could do just
as good as Cathy on the dating.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.520
Power on.

11:30.080 --> 11:33.280
"Press any key to continue."

11:37.200 --> 11:38.720
Any key...

11:41.120 --> 11:44.000
There's no fuckin' "any key" on it.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.600
Try that one.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.160
SHE LAUGHS

11:52.160 --> 11:54.880
Search. Yes, please.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.160
Search... What... Search for what?

12:00.080 --> 12:01.120
"Woman...

12:02.480 --> 12:03.520
"..needs...

12:04.880 --> 12:06.080
"..man."

12:07.280 --> 12:10.280
Oh, no...that's fuckin' Wogan!

12:12.760 --> 12:14.720
No.

12:14.720 --> 12:17.280
"Wo-man...

12:17.280 --> 12:19.640
"needs...

12:19.640 --> 12:21.720
"man."

12:21.720 --> 12:22.840
Search.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.000
Ya dirty bastards!

12:43.640 --> 12:44.920
"Lady..."

12:46.080 --> 12:48.080
"Lady...

12:49.400 --> 12:55.320
"..looking for love."

12:57.720 --> 12:59.080
Search.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.080
Jackpot!

13:05.240 --> 13:07.920
Jesus, they're gorgeous!

13:07.920 --> 13:10.200
Now, you see,
I'd go out with any of them.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.480
Now what's the name of that?

13:13.480 --> 13:16.560
Hiya, Grandad.
Cathy, is that you?

13:16.560 --> 13:21.080
Yes, Mammy. Come into the kitchen,
quick. I think I hit the jackpot!

13:21.080 --> 13:23.680
I got on your top top tap top...

13:25.320 --> 13:26.560
I got on the Google...

13:28.000 --> 13:30.160
..and I Googled...

13:30.160 --> 13:32.680
and I think I found a perfect site!

13:32.680 --> 13:36.120
Oh, there's loads of gorgeous
men on there, Cathy.
I'd go out with any of them.

13:36.120 --> 13:40.240
Oh, fantastic.
Right, what's it called?

13:40.240 --> 13:42.960
It's called Dial a Dick.

13:51.920 --> 13:54.160
Mammy...

13:54.160 --> 13:56.880
they're gigolos!

13:56.880 --> 13:59.680
What? There's nothing wrong
with Spanish men!

14:02.080 --> 14:05.880
You pay these men and they
come out and have sex with you.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.720
That's disgusting!

14:10.720 --> 14:12.640
Jesus.... that's immoral.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.600
It's wrong, it's just complet...

14:14.600 --> 14:16.840
Oh, my God, I'm going to be sick!

14:18.360 --> 14:20.240
How much do you pay them?

14:26.760 --> 14:29.840
Here, Agnes, how come you never
got another man? I don't know.

14:29.840 --> 14:34.800
I know, you got married for better
or for worse. Yeah, that's it yeah.

14:34.800 --> 14:38.040
He couldn't do any better
and I could do any fuckin' worse.

14:39.520 --> 14:42.120
Hello, ladies.
Is Cathy or Maria here?

14:42.120 --> 14:45.480
They're up at the bar talking
to Sharon. Oh, I see them.
How's Bono, love?

14:45.480 --> 14:48.960
Don't talk to me, Mrs Brown.
He has me heart broken.

14:48.960 --> 14:52.280
The sex education this week, he's
asking me question after question.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.120
I don't know what to be telling him.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.520
Tell him the truth - he was
found under a heavy cabbage!

14:59.600 --> 15:02.280
You see, Buster,
love is a strange thing.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.880
You have to be careful.
I know what you mean.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.520
Sometimes you need to use two bags

15:06.520 --> 15:08.480
in case the one off of
her head falls off.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.880
I mean you have to be careful
about where you place your love.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.320
Oh, I know where to place it,
all right!

15:20.000 --> 15:21.280
I have one rule.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.800
Never date a good-looking girl,
in case she leaves ya.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.800
But an ugly girl could
leave you, too.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.040
I know, but who cares?

15:28.640 --> 15:30.240
I'm going to the gents.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.640
Me too.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.320
All right, love? Yeah.

15:35.320 --> 15:38.640
All right, Cathy? You fancy
going for a drink sometime?

15:38.640 --> 15:42.160
I'd rather stick
cocktail sticks in me eyes.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.920
I'll take that as a maybe.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.200
Any luck on the internet, Agnes?

15:49.200 --> 15:51.680
Cathy narrowed it down to three.

15:51.680 --> 15:56.000
Indigo55, Rayband61...

15:56.000 --> 15:59.040
but the one she picked
is HairyHarry66.

16:00.080 --> 16:03.840
He's coming over to our house
on Valentine's night for dinner.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.840
Well, Hairy Harry sounds
interesting.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.480
Hairy Harry sounds fuckin' hairy!

16:08.480 --> 16:11.160
Is there nobody
called Paddy any more?

16:11.160 --> 16:14.440
You know, you should skip the
internet and go for somebody local.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.520
Like who? What about Jimmy McGinty?

16:17.520 --> 16:19.120
Would ya feck off!

16:19.120 --> 16:20.840
I wouldn't be his type.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.360
What type would that be?

16:22.360 --> 16:23.480
Inflatable.

16:27.120 --> 16:30.360
Jesus, these knickers are killing me.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.600
I can't wait to take them off.

16:34.720 --> 16:38.800
Well, if you're lucky, you might get
someone to take them off for you...

16:38.800 --> 16:40.240
with their teeth!

16:41.840 --> 16:44.960
Well, you two are all right,
going home to a man in your bed.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.040
BOTH: Yeah.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.480
Well, excuse me!

16:47.480 --> 16:50.680
It's different when you're
married. Isn't it, Betty?

16:50.680 --> 16:52.520
Yeah. Very.

16:52.520 --> 16:57.040
Dermot used to be so romantic,
but not now.

16:57.040 --> 17:00.200
When will men learn that
sex is not romance?

17:00.200 --> 17:05.120
Oh, that note, let's drink up and go.
Tonight is our night.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.920
Did you hear that, Buster?

17:13.920 --> 17:16.840
Not much after she said
take them off with me teeth.

17:20.160 --> 17:23.200
What about Mikey Nolan for a date?
I mean, he's a bit of fun.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.600
Mikey Nolan is feckin' mad!

17:25.600 --> 17:27.800
Do you remember the community dance?

17:27.800 --> 17:30.200
And he thought it would be
great fun to strip off naked

17:30.200 --> 17:32.360
and run around the room
when he's nude...

17:32.360 --> 17:35.600
with his willy
wacking off everything.

17:35.600 --> 17:38.400
Ugliest willy I've ever seen.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.880
Looked like a blind
carpenter's thumb.

17:42.680 --> 17:45.400
He had the thing cut off, didn't he?

17:45.400 --> 17:46.800
What?

17:46.800 --> 17:50.720
What'cha call that useless
bit of skin at the end of a willy?

17:50.720 --> 17:52.200
A man.

17:59.920 --> 18:01.360
The other end.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.600
BOTH: Foreskin!

18:04.600 --> 18:06.360
He had a circumvision.

18:08.680 --> 18:12.200
There was a chap
who lived in our road who used
to help the rabbi with that. Hm?!

18:12.200 --> 18:14.800
Yes, he used to collect all
the little bits of skin.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.960
He used to make things out of them.

18:17.960 --> 18:20.440
Made my father a lovely wallet.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.720
It was gorgeous.

18:21.720 --> 18:24.600
If you rubbed it,
it turned into a fuckin' suitcase!

18:27.280 --> 18:31.280
Maria's right.
I do take her for granted.

18:31.280 --> 18:32.840
I need to do something.

18:32.840 --> 18:34.840
A grand gesture, something big.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.080
A bus.

18:39.320 --> 18:40.520
What?

18:40.520 --> 18:43.120
I have a friend.
He works down the bus station.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.400
He sells the ads
on the sides of them.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.600
If you want, I can have a chat with
him. He could do us a freebie.

18:48.600 --> 18:51.840
How big an ad? As big as you want.
I can get you the whole bus
if you want.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.880
Brilliant, I'll do it for
Valentine's. Tell him to write...

18:54.880 --> 18:56.440
Hang on, Dermo.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.080
Right, go ahead.

19:01.080 --> 19:05.120
Maria Brown is the most wonderful
wife and mother in the world

19:05.120 --> 19:07.040
and I love her.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.520
How'd you spell that?

19:10.760 --> 19:11.880
Which word?

19:11.880 --> 19:13.120
All of it.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.520
You won't find them in there.

19:31.080 --> 19:34.240
I know exactly
what you're looking for.

19:36.520 --> 19:40.240
Now, I'm going to give you
jump up Johnny tonight.

19:40.240 --> 19:44.760
Because tonight, I want you
to go out and I don't care
if you never feckin' come back!

19:46.240 --> 19:48.760
Come on, fetch!

19:51.160 --> 19:52.680
Give Smelly Nelly me best.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.000
< DOOR CLOSES

20:01.000 --> 20:04.040
Winnie. Howya, Agnes?
What are you doing over here?

20:04.040 --> 20:07.880
Just came over to wish you luck and
tell ya, give him a good seeing to!

20:09.360 --> 20:13.280
Winnie, you know the ABC book?
Yeah. Do you remember
the wheelbarrow thing?

20:13.280 --> 20:15.960
Oh, yeah! What did it look like?

20:15.960 --> 20:20.280
Oh, right. Well, he's here and
you're there, or is it the other...

20:20.280 --> 20:22.880
Tell ya what, Agnes.
Lie down there and I'll show you.

20:22.880 --> 20:26.800
No, no, no. Agnes, it'll only take
a few minutes. It's not that
feckin' important. Come on!

20:46.320 --> 20:48.040
Winnie, slow down, for fuck's sake!

20:48.040 --> 20:49.080
Mammy!

20:52.960 --> 20:55.160
What are you doing?

20:55.160 --> 20:59.320
Agnes, if you do that twice a day
for a week you'll lose five pounds.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.360
See ya later.

21:02.960 --> 21:08.240
Thanks, Winnie! It was a thing that
Winnie saw on WeightWatchers.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.360
Was it, now?
Do you want a cup of tea?

21:10.360 --> 21:12.520
No, Mammy,
I'm heading over to Betty's.

21:12.520 --> 21:15.160
Mark has to work late,
so she has no date, either.

21:15.160 --> 21:16.280
OK.

21:16.280 --> 21:18.840
Give you a chance to have
the house to yourself for the night.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.320
Yes.

21:20.320 --> 21:23.600
This is the first Valentine I
remember that you don't have a date.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.560
I was thinking that earlier.

21:25.560 --> 21:26.640
You all right?

21:26.640 --> 21:28.640
I'm fine, Mammy.

21:28.640 --> 21:31.760
YOU'RE the one with the date.
Are YOU all right?

21:31.760 --> 21:33.880
I'm nervous, but I'm excited.

21:33.880 --> 21:36.400
Cathy, you know the thong thing?

21:36.400 --> 21:37.440
Yeah.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.720
You know the skinny bit, does that
go to the front or the back?

21:40.720 --> 21:42.400
The back!

21:42.400 --> 21:44.720
I fuckin' knew it!

21:44.720 --> 21:47.600
I'm flossing the ying yang
off meself.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.760
Cathy, what if he doesn't turn up?

21:57.760 --> 22:00.920
Ah, Mammy, he will. He sounded keen.

22:00.920 --> 22:04.560
He did, didn't he?
And I've been practicing me opera.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.720
# Na-hiiiigh, ho-ho!

22:06.720 --> 22:08.280
# Liii-ckim!

22:08.280 --> 22:10.040
# Naaaay! #

22:12.480 --> 22:14.880
That's as far as I get,
then I get dizzy.

22:16.560 --> 22:19.000
Mammy, fellatio is...

22:19.000 --> 22:20.200
Hard to fuckin' sing!

22:21.520 --> 22:24.440
Forget it, Mammy. Have a good night.

22:24.440 --> 22:25.800
Good night, love.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.920
How do you do?

22:35.920 --> 22:37.280
How do you DO?

22:40.880 --> 22:42.800
How do you DO?

22:43.920 --> 22:45.760
Hello there.

22:47.640 --> 22:49.720
How do you do?

22:49.720 --> 22:51.960
SHE LAUGHS

22:51.960 --> 22:54.240
Frighten the shite out of him!

22:56.440 --> 23:01.960
Oh, do sit down, please, do sit
down. Make yourself comfortable.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.760
Oh, don't show me that!

23:05.880 --> 23:07.680
I am a virgin!

23:16.680 --> 23:20.960
Oh, there's a candle
to say I love you.

23:25.280 --> 23:28.880
And that's a candle to say
keep your fuckin' hands to yourself.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.440
PHONE RINGS

23:38.600 --> 23:39.880
Hello?

23:41.240 --> 23:44.440
Yeah, Harry... hello.

23:44.440 --> 23:45.920
Are ya lost?

23:48.200 --> 23:49.280
Yes.

23:52.360 --> 23:53.400
I see.

23:54.680 --> 23:57.120
No, no, no.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.600
Well, keep in touch.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.400
Oh, lovely.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.200
He's not feckin' coming!

24:07.080 --> 24:09.360
Ooh, hoo-hoo!

24:09.360 --> 24:11.360
Hee-hee.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.480
SHE SNIFFS

24:25.720 --> 24:27.400
Shh, Betty!

24:27.400 --> 24:30.200
Knock, Cathy, don't just barge in.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.360
KNOCKING

24:31.360 --> 24:32.520
It's open.

24:36.640 --> 24:39.520
Oh, God, I don't think he turned up!

24:39.520 --> 24:42.920
Hello, girls. Hiya, Mammy.
What are you two doing here?

24:42.920 --> 24:44.880
We were just heading
down for a drink.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.040
We thought we'd drop in
on the way to meet Harry.

24:47.040 --> 24:50.000
Well, tough luck.
He didn't come, did he?

24:50.000 --> 24:51.640
He didn't even arrive, love.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.480
Jesus, is this an invasion?

24:58.480 --> 25:01.280
What are you doing here and who
are them feckin' flowers for?

25:01.280 --> 25:02.320
You.

25:03.880 --> 25:07.160
I didn't tell ya, but my son didn't
know it when he had a good thing.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.280
Happy Valentine's Day.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.080
They're beautiful.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.960
I haven't had Valentine's flowers...

25:18.960 --> 25:20.280
ever.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.800
"Property of St Francis Cemetery."

25:25.400 --> 25:26.800
Ya bastard!

25:28.400 --> 25:30.720
You're just looking
for another tablet.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.680
Here, off with ya.

25:32.680 --> 25:35.480
And the next time you're in a
graveyard, Grandad, hold on there.

25:35.480 --> 25:36.960
Save us all the fuckin' walk.

25:38.920 --> 25:41.280
Who's the lucky girl?
Molly or Nelly?

25:41.280 --> 25:42.440
Both!

25:44.120 --> 25:45.920
We're having a threesome!

25:49.600 --> 25:51.960
What are yous doing here?

25:51.960 --> 25:54.680
I had to tell ya what Dermot
did for me for Valentine's.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.680
What? A bus.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.960
A whole bus.

25:59.960 --> 26:03.800
And it reads, "Maria Brown
is the most wonderful wif

26:03.800 --> 26:05.240
"and mother in the world..."

26:07.160 --> 26:08.680
Wif? What's a fuckin' wif?

26:10.680 --> 26:15.160
It doesn't matter.
"..and I love her."

26:15.160 --> 26:17.960
Now that's what I call romance.
Well done, Dermot.

26:19.520 --> 26:22.000
What are you doing here?
It's in the script.

26:24.440 --> 26:27.160
Well, there's one you can tell
your children when you grow up.

26:27.160 --> 26:30.400
"There was a time when I
was a fuckin' typing error."

26:34.880 --> 26:36.800
Oh, not you two, as well!

26:36.800 --> 26:38.280
Howya, Mammy?

26:38.280 --> 26:40.200
Oh, my God! Did you see the bus?

26:40.200 --> 26:42.960
Isn't it fab? "I love Maria Brown."

26:42.960 --> 26:44.360
Not that, the other one.

26:44.360 --> 26:45.720
ALL: What other one?

26:45.720 --> 26:49.160
Well, it said
"Cathy Brown is beautiful

26:49.160 --> 26:51.520
"and she doesn't need her
tits blown up!"

26:54.320 --> 26:57.080
Who in the name of God wrote that?

27:05.600 --> 27:07.920
It's hot in here, isn't it?

27:07.920 --> 27:11.720
Not as hot as it's going to be
when I set fire to your eyebrows.

27:13.880 --> 27:16.760
Look, I'm delighted
to see all of you

27:16.760 --> 27:20.080
and I know you're disappointed
that my date didn't turn up.

27:20.080 --> 27:22.120
But it's still Valentine's night.

27:22.120 --> 27:24.800
So, go on, all of you,
go out and have a good time.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.480
Hold on, Buster.

27:31.960 --> 27:34.040
Maybe I will go for that drink
with ya after all.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.320
Mammy, will you be all right?

27:37.320 --> 27:39.640
I'll be fine. Go on, off with ya.

27:39.640 --> 27:42.120
C'mon, you!
Cathy, can I hold your hand?

27:42.120 --> 27:43.600
No!

27:45.000 --> 27:46.880
Baby steps, Buster, baby steps.

27:49.640 --> 27:52.680
Good night. Enjoy yourselves.

27:56.760 --> 28:00.280
I love to see young people going out
and enjoying themselves.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.680
Get up them stairs.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.080
Good night!

28:20.160 --> 28:24.400
# Say hello to the queen
of Dublin town

28:26.480 --> 28:32.400
# As the best mum of all
she wears the crown

28:32.400 --> 28:35.840
# Mother hen watching all her chicks

28:35.840 --> 28:38.640
# Sassy old lady full of tricks!

28:38.640 --> 28:44.400
# It's a safe bet she'd never
let life get her down!

28:44.400 --> 28:47.680
# She's Mrs Brown!
Agnes!

28:47.680 --> 28:50.320
# That's Mrs Brown!
Agnes!

28:50.320 --> 28:52.880
# Our Mrs Brown! #
