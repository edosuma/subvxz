09:23.611 --> 09:26.581
I was trying to help him

09:26.647 --> 09:29.350
And General Curtis LeMay,
whom I served under,

09:29.417 --> 09:32.788
as a matter of fact,
in World War II, was saying:

09:32.854 --> 09:37.793
"Let's go in.
Let's totally destroy Cuba."

09:58.379 --> 10:01.416
On that critical Saturday,
October 27th,

10:01.482 --> 10:06.487
we had two Khrushchev
messages in front of us.

10:06.554 --> 10:10.725
One had come in Friday night,
and it had been dictated

10:10.792 --> 10:15.897
by a man who was either drunk,
or under tremendous stress.

10:15.964 --> 10:19.200
Basically, he said,
"If you'll guarantee you
won't invade Cuba

10:19.267 --> 10:21.069
we'll take the missiles out."

10:21.136 --> 10:24.505
Then, before we could
respond, we had a
second message

10:24.572 --> 10:28.176
that had been dictated
by a bunch of hard-liners.

10:28.243 --> 10:33.048
And it said, in effect,
"If you attack...

10:33.114 --> 10:36.517
we're prepared...

10:36.584 --> 10:39.454
to confront you with
masses of military power."

So, what to do?
We had the--

10:40.989 --> 10:43.124
I'll call it the soft message
and the hard message.

10:45.193 --> 10:49.831
At the elbow of President
Kennedy was Tommy Thompson,

10:49.898 --> 10:53.134
former U.S. ambassador
to Moscow.

10:53.201 --> 10:55.837
He and Jane, his wife, had
literally lived
with Khrushchev

10:55.904 --> 10:57.338
and his wife upon occasion.

10:57.405 --> 11:00.208
Tommy Thompson said,
"Mr. President

11:00.275 --> 11:04.579
I urge you to respond
to the soft message."

11:04.645 --> 11:06.381
The president said to Tommy,

11:06.447 --> 11:09.717
"We can't do that.
That'll get us nowhere."

11:09.784 --> 11:12.120
Tommy said,
"Mr. President,
you're wrong."

11:12.187 --> 11:14.289
Now, that takes a
lot of guts.

11:40.815 --> 11:45.453
In Thompson's mind
was this thought:

11:45.520 --> 11:48.189
"Khrushchev's gotten
himself in a hell of a fix."

11:48.256 --> 11:49.457
He would then
think to himself,

11:49.524 --> 11:51.826
"My God,
if I can get out of this

11:51.893 --> 11:55.730
with a deal that I can say
to the Russian people:

11:55.796 --> 12:00.768
'Kennedy was going to destroy
Castro and I prevented it.'"

12:00.835 --> 12:03.638
Thompson, knowing Khrushchev
as he did, thought:

12:03.704 --> 12:05.540
"Khrushchev will accept that."

decisions and their actions.

to invade Cuba.

12:43.111 --> 12:44.980

12:45.046 --> 12:46.814
That undoubtedly influenced
their thinking.

12:46.881 --> 12:48.449
I think that's correct.

12:48.516 --> 12:50.351
But more importantly,

12:50.418 --> 12:52.253
from a Cuban and a Russian
point of view,

12:52.320 --> 12:55.123
they knew what, in a sense,
I really didn't know.

12:55.190 --> 12:57.325
We had attempted
to assassinate Castro

12:57.392 --> 12:59.527

and under Kennedy,

12:59.594 --> 13:00.595
and later, under Johnson.

13:00.661 --> 13:02.463
And in addition to that,

13:02.530 --> 13:05.066
major voices in the U.S.
were calling for invasion.

13:11.339 --> 13:15.110
In the first message,
Khrushchev said this:

13:18.213 --> 13:21.816
"We and you ought not pull
on the ends of a rope,

13:21.882 --> 13:25.186
"which you have tied
the knots of war.

13:28.456 --> 13:31.392
"Because the more
the two of us pull,

13:32.727 --> 13:35.763
"the tighter the knot
will be tied.

13:39.234 --> 13:43.171
"And then it will be
necessary to cut that knot,

13:43.238 --> 13:49.344
"and what that would mean is
not for me to explain to you.

13:49.410 --> 13:54.215
"I have participated in two
wars and know that war ends,

13:54.282 --> 13:57.552
"when it has rolled through
cities and villages

13:57.618 --> 14:01.189

display wisdom,

will commence."

and nuclear weapons
will destroy nations.

are on 15-minute alert,

by Castro in Havana, Cuba,

to accept that?

on our heads? My God!

out without war.

the five chiefs over

"Gentlemen, we won.

to say it,

And LeMay said,
"Won? Hell, we lost!

18:17.312 --> 18:20.681
We should go in
and wipe them out today."

18:20.748 --> 18:22.350
[LAUGHS]

18:24.885 --> 18:26.487

ultimately

18:26.554 --> 18:27.955
we're going
to confront these people

18:30.925 --> 18:32.960

greater superiority

18:33.027 --> 18:35.563
than we will have
in the future.

18:48.576 --> 18:51.312
At the time, we had a 17-to-1

18:51.379 --> 18:54.081

in nuclear numbers.

retain that advantage

19:01.756 --> 19:06.427
if we limited the tests.
The chiefs were all opposed.

19:06.494 --> 19:08.563
They said,
"The Soviets will cheat."

19:08.629 --> 19:11.231
Well, I said,
"How will they cheat?"

19:11.298 --> 19:13.868
You won't believe this,
but they said:

19:13.934 --> 19:18.272
"They'll test them
behind the moon."

19:18.339 --> 19:21.476
I said,
"You're out of your mind."

19:21.542 --> 19:23.478
I--
That's absurd.

19:26.013 --> 19:28.949
It's almost impossible
for our people today

19:29.016 --> 19:33.554
to put themselves back
into that period.

19:33.621 --> 19:36.190
In my seven years
as secretary,

19:36.256 --> 19:39.960
we came within a hairsbreadth
of war with the Soviet Union

19:40.027 --> 19:41.929
on three different occasions.

19:41.996 --> 19:44.765
Twenty-four hours a day,
365 days a year,

19:44.832 --> 19:46.867
for seven years as
secretary of defense,

19:46.934 --> 19:48.636
I lived the Cold War.

19:50.705 --> 19:52.072
During the Kennedy
administration,

19:52.139 --> 19:56.511
they designed
a 100-megaton bomb.

19:56.577 --> 19:58.779
It was tested
in the atmosphere.

19:58.846 --> 20:00.915
I remember this.

20:00.981 --> 20:04.952
Cold War?
Hell, it was a hot war.

20:08.589 --> 20:13.861
I think the human race needs
to think more about killing,

20:13.928 --> 20:15.863
about conflict.

20:15.930 --> 20:18.866
Is that what we want
in this 21st century?

20:50.898 --> 20:57.004
My earliest memory is
of a city exploding with joy.

20:57.071 --> 21:02.209
It was November 11, 1918.
I was 2 years old.

21:03.811 --> 21:07.748
You may not believe that
I have the memory, but I do.

21:07.815 --> 21:11.218
I remember the tops
of the streetcars

21:11.285 --> 21:14.889
being crowded
with human beings

21:14.955 --> 21:18.258
cheering and kissing
and screaming.

21:18.325 --> 21:20.795
End of World War I.
We'd won.

21:22.229 --> 21:24.765
But also celebrating
the belief

21:24.832 --> 21:27.535
of many Americans,
particularly Woodrow Wilson,

21:27.602 --> 21:29.970
we'd fought a war
to end all wars.

21:32.773 --> 21:34.842
His dream was

21:34.909 --> 21:39.046
that the world could avoid
great wars in the future.

21:39.113 --> 21:43.217
Disputes among great nations
would be resolved.

21:47.021 --> 21:48.523
I also remember

21:48.589 --> 21:50.324
that I wasn't allowed
to go outdoors

21:50.390 --> 21:52.226
to play with my friends,

21:52.292 --> 21:54.394
without wearing a mask.

21:54.461 --> 21:57.965
There was an ungodly
flu epidemic.

21:58.032 --> 22:01.468
Large numbers of Americans
were dying, 600,000.

22:01.536 --> 22:04.304
And millions across
the world.

22:16.483 --> 22:18.385
My class in the first grade

22:18.452 --> 22:21.088
was housed in a shack,
a wooden shack.

22:21.155 --> 22:23.190
But we had an absolutely
superb teacher.

22:23.257 --> 22:27.962
And this teacher gave a test
to the class every month,

22:28.028 --> 22:29.930
and she re-seated the class

22:29.997 --> 22:31.866
based on the results
of that test.

22:31.932 --> 22:33.801
There were vertical rows,

22:33.868 --> 22:35.703
and she put the person
with the highest grade

22:35.770 --> 22:38.005
in the first seat
on the left-hand row.

22:38.072 --> 22:40.708
And I worked my tail off
to be in that first seat.

22:40.775 --> 22:43.043
Now, the majority of the
classmates were whites,

22:43.110 --> 22:44.278
Caucasians, so on.

22:44.344 --> 22:45.880
WASPs, if you will.

22:45.946 --> 22:50.484
But my competition
for that first seat

22:50.551 --> 22:52.553
were Chinese,
Japanese and Jews.

22:52.620 --> 22:53.921
On Saturday and Sunday,

22:53.988 --> 22:55.289
I went and played
with my classmates.

22:55.355 --> 22:57.424
They went to their
ethnic schools.

22:57.491 --> 22:59.093
They learned their
native language.

22:59.159 --> 23:01.061
They learned their
culture, their history.

23:01.128 --> 23:03.463
And they came back determined
on Monday

23:03.530 --> 23:04.799
to beat that damn Irishman.

23:04.865 --> 23:08.235
But they didn't do it
very often.

23:08.302 --> 23:09.837
One congressman called you

23:09.904 --> 23:11.772
"Mr. I-Have-All-The-Answers
McNamara."

23:11.839 --> 23:14.609
And there's been suggestion
from some congressmen

23:14.675 --> 23:16.043
that you come up there,

23:16.110 --> 23:17.745
in spite of the weight
of their experience,

23:17.812 --> 23:20.147
prepared to give them simple
little lessons in things.

23:20.214 --> 23:21.749
Is that your attitude?

23:21.816 --> 23:25.886
No. Perhaps they don't know
how much I don't know.

23:25.953 --> 23:27.521
And there is much indeed.

23:27.588 --> 23:30.057
I do make a serious effort

23:30.124 --> 23:32.727
to prepare myself properly

23:32.793 --> 23:34.729
for these
congressional discussions.

23:34.795 --> 23:38.565
I suppose I spend, perhaps,
100 or 120 hours

23:38.633 --> 23:41.235
in testifying before
Congress each year.

23:41.301 --> 23:43.971
And each hour
of testimony requires,

23:44.038 --> 23:46.473
uh, three to four hours
of preparation.

23:46.540 --> 23:48.676
REASONER:
What about the contention

23:48.743 --> 23:50.077
that your attitude
is sometimes arrogant?

23:50.144 --> 23:51.612
That you'd never admit
you were wrong.

23:51.679 --> 23:52.980
Have you ever been wrong, sir?

23:53.047 --> 23:54.682
Oh, yes, indeed.
My heavens.

23:54.749 --> 23:57.051
I'm not gonna tell you
when I've been wrong.

23:57.117 --> 23:59.687
If you don't know,
I'm not going to tell you.

23:59.754 --> 24:01.355
Oh, on countless occasions.

24:05.325 --> 24:07.527
I applied
to Stanford University.

24:07.594 --> 24:08.996
I very much wanted to go.

24:09.063 --> 24:10.631
But I couldn't afford it,

24:10.698 --> 24:12.933
so I lived at home
and I went to Berkeley.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.035
Fifty-two dollars
a year tuition.

24:15.102 --> 24:18.072
I started Berkeley at the
bottom of the Depression.

24:18.138 --> 24:20.808
Twenty-five million males
were unemployed.

24:20.875 --> 24:22.409
Out of that class of 3500

24:22.476 --> 24:25.746
three elected to
Phi Beta Kappa at the
end of sophomore year.

24:25.813 --> 24:28.649
Of those three, one became
a Rhodes Scholar,

24:28.716 --> 24:29.984
I went to Harvard

24:30.050 --> 24:32.586
the third went to work
for $65 a month

24:32.653 --> 24:35.956
and was damn happy
to have the job.

24:36.023 --> 24:39.493
The society was on
the verge of, uh...

24:39.559 --> 24:41.561
I don't want to say
revolution.

24:41.628 --> 24:45.833
Although, had Roosevelt not
done some of the
things he did

24:45.900 --> 24:49.136
it could've become
far more violent.

24:49.203 --> 24:53.674
In any event, that was
what I was thrown into.

24:53.741 --> 24:55.843
I never heard
of Plato and Aristotle

24:55.910 --> 24:58.045
before I became
a freshman at Berkeley.

24:58.112 --> 25:00.347
And I remember the professor,
Lowenberg,

25:00.414 --> 25:02.750
the freshman
philosophy professor--

25:02.817 --> 25:05.285
I couldn't wait
to go to another class.

25:17.197 --> 25:20.400
I took more philosophy
courses, particularly one
in logic

25:20.467 --> 25:22.502
and one in ethics.

25:24.705 --> 25:27.808
Stress on values,

25:27.875 --> 25:30.978
something beyond one's self

25:31.045 --> 25:34.281
and a responsibility
to society.

25:36.751 --> 25:39.053
After graduating
University of California

25:39.119 --> 25:41.121
I went to Harvard Graduate
School of Business

25:41.188 --> 25:42.622
for two years,

25:42.689 --> 25:44.892
and then I went back
to San Francisco.

25:47.361 --> 25:50.297
I began to court this
young lady

25:50.364 --> 25:51.899
that I'd met when we were 17

25:51.966 --> 25:53.968
in our first week
at Berkeley:

25:55.069 --> 25:57.237
Margaret Craig.

25:57.304 --> 26:02.709
And I was making some
progress after eight or
nine months.

26:02.777 --> 26:05.445
I proposed and she accepted.

26:05.512 --> 26:08.849
She went with her
aunt and her mother

26:08.916 --> 26:10.350
on a trip across the country.

26:10.417 --> 26:14.454
She telegraphed me,
"Must order engraved
invitations

26:14.521 --> 26:16.824
to include your middle name,
what is it?"

26:16.891 --> 26:19.226
I wired back,
"My middle name is Strange."

26:19.293 --> 26:21.728
She said, "I know it's
strange, but what is it?"

26:21.796 --> 26:25.432
Well, I mean, it is Strange.
It's Robert Strange McNamara.

26:32.807 --> 26:36.010
And it was a marriage
made in heaven.

26:39.046 --> 26:43.017
At the end of a year,
we had our first child.

26:43.083 --> 26:49.323
The delivery costs were $100,
and we paid that $10 a month.

26:49.389 --> 26:52.993
Those were some of the
happiest days of our lives.

26:54.261 --> 26:57.064
And then the war came.

27:05.806 --> 27:07.942
I'd been promoted
to assistant professor.

27:08.008 --> 27:10.710
I was the youngest assistant
professor at Harvard.

27:10.777 --> 27:14.815
And on a salary, by the way,
of $4000 a year.

27:19.753 --> 27:23.557
Harvard Business School's
market was drying up.

27:23.623 --> 27:26.526
The males were being drafted
or volunteering.

27:26.593 --> 27:28.395
So the dean,
being farsighted,

27:28.462 --> 27:30.397
brought back
a government contract

27:30.464 --> 27:32.933
to establish
an officer candidate school

27:33.000 --> 27:34.301
for what was called

27:34.368 --> 27:37.604
Statistical Control
in the Air Force.

27:44.411 --> 27:45.913
We said to the Air Force,

27:45.980 --> 27:47.882
"Look, we're not gonna
take anybody you send
up here.

27:47.948 --> 27:50.750
We're gonna select the
people."

27:50.817 --> 27:53.954
You have a punch card
for every human being

27:54.021 --> 27:55.555
brought into the Air Corps.

27:55.622 --> 27:57.024
We're gonna run
those punch cards

27:57.091 --> 28:00.127
through the IBM
sorting machines,

28:00.194 --> 28:04.798
and we're gonna sort on age,
education, accomplishment,

28:04.865 --> 28:07.367
grades, et cetera.

28:08.969 --> 28:11.471
We were looking for the best
and the brightest.

28:11.538 --> 28:15.876
The best brains,
the greatest capacity
to lead,

28:15.943 --> 28:17.978
the best judgment.

28:29.389 --> 28:31.625
The U.S. was just beginning
to bomb.

28:33.127 --> 28:35.095
We were bombing by daylight.

28:35.162 --> 28:38.265
The loss rate was very,
very high.

28:40.700 --> 28:44.504
So they commissioned a study.
And what did we find?

28:44.571 --> 28:47.141
We found the abort rate
was 20 percent.

28:47.207 --> 28:49.676
20 percent of the planes
that took off from England,

28:49.743 --> 28:51.145
to bomb targets in Germany,

28:51.211 --> 28:53.113
turned around before
they got to the target.

28:53.180 --> 28:54.481
That was a hell of a mess.

28:54.548 --> 28:57.317
We lost 20 percent
of our capability right there.

28:57.384 --> 28:59.253
The form, I think,
was called Form 1-A

28:59.319 --> 29:01.721
or something like that.
It was a mission report.

29:01.788 --> 29:04.791
And if you aborted a mission,
you had to write down why.

29:04.858 --> 29:08.395
So we get all these things
and we analyze them,

29:08.462 --> 29:10.797
and we finally concluded:

29:10.864 --> 29:12.399
It was baloney.

29:12.466 --> 29:14.801
They were aborting
out of fear.

29:14.868 --> 29:17.704
Because the loss rate
was four percent per sortie.

29:17.771 --> 29:19.806
The combat tour
was 25 sorties.

29:19.873 --> 29:21.976
It didn't mean 100 percent
were gonna be killed,

29:22.042 --> 29:24.411
but a hell of a lot
of them were gonna be killed.

29:24.478 --> 29:25.845
They knew that
and they found reasons

29:25.912 --> 29:28.648
to not go over the target.

29:29.683 --> 29:32.219
So we reported this.

29:37.424 --> 29:40.127
One of the commanders
was Curtis LeMay.

29:40.194 --> 29:43.630
Colonel in command
of a B-24 group.

29:43.697 --> 29:46.166
He was the finest
combat commander

29:46.233 --> 29:48.235
of any service
I came across in war.

29:48.302 --> 29:50.370
But he was extraordinarily
belligerent,

29:50.437 --> 29:52.272
many thought brutal.

29:52.339 --> 29:55.442
He got the report.
He issued an order.

29:55.509 --> 29:58.378
He said, "I will be in the
lead plane on every mission.

29:58.445 --> 30:01.515
"Any plane that takes off
will go over the target

30:01.581 --> 30:03.617
or the crew will be
court-martialed."

30:03.683 --> 30:06.420
The abort rate dropped
overnight.

30:08.122 --> 30:10.624
Now, that's the kind
of a commander he was.

30:12.159 --> 30:13.560
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

30:13.627 --> 30:16.730
the president
of the United States.

30:16.796 --> 30:20.300
ROOSEVELT:
My friends,
on this Christmas Eve

30:20.367 --> 30:22.636
there are over 10 million men

30:22.702 --> 30:27.107
in the Armed Forces of
the United States alone.

30:27.174 --> 30:32.979
One year ago, 1,700,000
were serving overseas.

30:33.047 --> 30:35.249
By next July first,

30:35.315 --> 30:40.020
that number will rise
to over five million.

30:40.087 --> 30:43.290
Plenty of bad news
for the Japs

30:43.357 --> 30:46.026
in the not-too-far-distant
future.

30:58.772 --> 31:01.475
[TURNSTILES DING]

31:05.312 --> 31:09.716
MCNAMARA:
The U.S. Air Force had a new
airplane, named the B-29.

31:17.057 --> 31:23.163
The B-17s and B-24s in Europe
bombed from 15, 16,000 feet.

31:24.998 --> 31:28.368
The problem was that they
were subject to
anti-aircraft fire

31:28.435 --> 31:31.571
and to fighter aircraft.

31:31.638 --> 31:34.474
To relieve that,
this B-29 was being developed

31:34.541 --> 31:36.710
that bombed from
high altitude,

31:36.776 --> 31:39.979
and it was thought
we could destroy targets

31:40.046 --> 31:41.915
much more efficiently
and effectively.

31:49.089 --> 31:51.591
I was brought back
from the 8th Air Force

31:51.658 --> 31:54.261
and assigned
to the first B-29s,

31:54.328 --> 31:57.097
the 58th Bomb Wing.

31:57.164 --> 32:03.903
We had to fly those planes
from the bases in
Kansas to India.

32:03.970 --> 32:07.741
Then we had to fly fuel
over the hump into China.

32:26.726 --> 32:31.765
The airfields were built
with Chinese labor.

32:33.667 --> 32:35.869
It was an insane operation.

32:39.706 --> 32:43.843
I can still remember them
hauling these huge rollers,

32:43.910 --> 32:47.681
to crush the stone
and make them flat.

32:49.082 --> 32:50.717
A long rope,
somebody would slip,

32:50.784 --> 32:52.118
the roller would roll
over him,

32:52.186 --> 32:54.754
everybody would
laugh and go on.

32:57.491 --> 32:59.993
We were supposed
to take these B-29s--

33:00.059 --> 33:02.028
There were
no tanker aircraft there.

33:02.095 --> 33:03.897
We were to fill
them with fuel,

33:03.963 --> 33:06.300
fly from India to Chengdu,

33:06.366 --> 33:07.834
offload the fuel,
fly back to India,

33:07.901 --> 33:11.971
make enough missions
to build up fuel in Chengdu,

33:12.038 --> 33:14.874
fly to Yawata, Japan, bomb
the steel mills

33:14.941 --> 33:16.743
and go back to India.

33:18.312 --> 33:20.780
We had so little training
on this problem

33:20.847 --> 33:22.649
of maximizing efficiency,

33:22.716 --> 33:25.519
we actually found,
to get some of the B-29s back

33:25.585 --> 33:29.088
instead of offloading fuel,
they had to take it on.

33:32.058 --> 33:36.196
To make a long story short,
it wasn't worth a damn.

33:36.263 --> 33:38.131
And it was LeMay who really

33:38.198 --> 33:40.234
came to that conclusion
and led the chiefs

33:40.300 --> 33:42.135
to move the whole thing
to the Marianas,

33:42.202 --> 33:44.404
which devastated Japan.

34:27.514 --> 34:31.150
LeMay was focused
on only one thing:

34:32.352 --> 34:34.654
Target destruction.

34:36.155 --> 34:38.124
Most Air Force generals
could tell you

34:38.191 --> 34:39.593
how many planes they had,

34:39.659 --> 34:41.127
how many tons of bombs
they dropped,

34:41.194 --> 34:42.362
or whatever the hell it was.

34:42.429 --> 34:44.798
But he was the only person
that I knew

34:44.864 --> 34:48.167
in the senior command in the
Air Force who focused solely

34:48.234 --> 34:52.739
on the loss of his crews
per unit of target
destruction.

34:57.010 --> 34:59.979
I was on the island of Guam,
in his command,

35:00.046 --> 35:03.182
in March of 1945.

35:04.651 --> 35:08.655
In that single night,
we burned to death

35:08.722 --> 35:12.359
100,000 Japanese
civilians in Tokyo.

35:12.426 --> 35:14.494
Men, women and children.

35:18.231 --> 35:21.301
MORRIS:
Were you aware
this was going to happen?

35:22.736 --> 35:25.305
Well, I was--

35:25.372 --> 35:30.009
I was part of a mechanism
that, in a sense,
recommended it.

35:44.624 --> 35:47.427
I analyzed bombing
operations,

35:47.494 --> 35:49.463
and how to make them
more efficient,

35:49.529 --> 35:52.599
i.e., not more efficient in
the sense of killing more,

35:52.666 --> 35:56.503
but more efficient
in weakening the adversary.

35:59.906 --> 36:03.377
I wrote one report analyzing

36:03.443 --> 36:07.814
the efficiency
of the B-29 operations.

36:07.881 --> 36:10.517
The B-29 could get above
the fighter aircraft

36:10.584 --> 36:12.018
and above the air defense,

36:12.085 --> 36:14.688
so the loss rate
would be much less.

36:14.754 --> 36:16.356
The problem was...

36:16.423 --> 36:18.458
the accuracy
was also much less.

36:29.769 --> 36:33.072
Now, I don't want to suggest
that it was my report

36:33.139 --> 36:36.510
that led to--
I'll call it the firebombing.

36:38.945 --> 36:41.047
It isn't that I'm trying
to absolve myself

36:41.114 --> 36:42.582
of blame for the firebombing.

36:42.649 --> 36:44.784
I don't want to suggest
that it was I...

36:44.851 --> 36:46.920
that put in LeMay's mind

36:46.986 --> 36:50.223
that his operations
were totally inefficient,

36:50.289 --> 36:51.958
and had to be drastically
changed.

36:52.025 --> 36:54.694
But, anyhow,
that's what he did.

36:54.761 --> 36:59.999
He took the B-29s
down to 5000 feet

37:00.066 --> 37:03.570
and he decided to bomb
with firebombs.

37:21.721 --> 37:23.723
I participated
in the interrogation

37:23.790 --> 37:27.961
of the B-29 bomber crews
that came back that night.

37:28.027 --> 37:32.599
A room full of crewmen
and intelligence
interrogators.

37:32.666 --> 37:34.668
A captain got up,
a young captain said:

37:34.734 --> 37:37.871
"Goddamn it, I'd like to know
who the son of a bitch was

37:37.937 --> 37:39.973
"that took this
magnificent airplane,

37:40.039 --> 37:42.876
"designed to bomb
from 23, 000 feet

37:42.942 --> 37:46.713
"and he took it down to 5000
feet, and I lost my wingman.

37:46.780 --> 37:48.548
He was shot and killed."

37:50.416 --> 37:53.052
LeMay spoke in monosyllables.

37:53.119 --> 37:55.088
I never heard him say

37:55.154 --> 37:57.591
more than two words
in sequence.

37:57.657 --> 38:01.294
It was basically,
"Yes," "No," "Yep"

38:01.360 --> 38:03.296
"That's all,"
or "Hell with it."

38:03.362 --> 38:06.533
That was all he said.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.569
And LeMay was totally
intolerant of criticism.

38:09.636 --> 38:13.873
He never engaged
in discussion with anybody.

38:13.940 --> 38:16.576
He stood up.

38:16.643 --> 38:18.612
"Why are we here?

38:18.678 --> 38:21.047
"Why are we here?

38:21.114 --> 38:25.318
"You lost your wingman.
It hurts me as much as

38:25.384 --> 38:26.853
"it does you.

38:26.920 --> 38:29.422
"I sent him there.

38:29.489 --> 38:32.125
"And I've been there,
I know what it is.

38:32.191 --> 38:35.194
"But you lost one wingman

38:35.261 --> 38:37.363
and we destroyed Tokyo."

38:42.802 --> 38:47.140
Fifty square miles
of Tokyo were burned.

38:47.206 --> 38:48.908
Tokyo was a wooden city,

38:48.975 --> 38:50.243
and when we dropped
these firebombs

38:50.309 --> 38:52.512
and it just burned it.

39:40.193 --> 39:43.262
MORRIS:
The choice
of incendiary bombs,

39:43.329 --> 39:46.633
where did that come from?

39:46.700 --> 39:48.868
I think the issue...

39:48.935 --> 39:51.605
is not so much
incendiary bombs.

39:51.671 --> 39:53.907
I think the issue is,
in order to win a war

39:53.973 --> 39:56.242
should you kill
100,000 people in one night?

39:56.309 --> 39:57.944
By firebombing or any
other way?

39:58.011 --> 40:00.513
LeMay's answer would be,
clearly, "Yes."

40:00.580 --> 40:02.215
"McNamara, do you mean to say

40:02.281 --> 40:04.250
"that instead
of killing 100,000

40:04.317 --> 40:06.720
"burning to death 100,000
Japanese civilians

40:06.786 --> 40:08.121
"in that one night

40:08.187 --> 40:10.890
"we should have burned to
death a lesser number or none?

40:10.957 --> 40:13.827
"And then had our soldiers
cross the beaches in Tokyo

40:13.893 --> 40:16.262
"and been slaughtered
in tens of thousands?

40:16.329 --> 40:19.699
Is that what you're proposing?
Is that moral? Is that wise?"

40:19.766 --> 40:22.368
Why was it necessary
to drop the nuclear bomb

40:22.435 --> 40:24.671
if LeMay was
burning up Japan?

40:24.738 --> 40:29.008
And he went on from Tokyo
to firebomb other cities.

40:29.075 --> 40:30.777
58 percent of Yokohama.

40:30.844 --> 40:32.411
Yokohama is roughly
the size of Cleveland.

40:32.478 --> 40:35.114
58 percent of Cleveland
destroyed.

40:37.116 --> 40:39.152
Tokyo is roughly the size
of New York.

40:39.218 --> 40:41.788
51 percent of New York
destroyed.

40:41.855 --> 40:44.457
99 percent of the equivalent
of Chattanooga,

40:44.523 --> 40:46.793
which was Toyama.

40:46.860 --> 40:49.095
40 percent of the equivalent
of Los Angeles,

40:49.162 --> 40:50.496
which was Nagoya.

40:52.431 --> 40:55.234
This was all done before

40:55.301 --> 40:57.503
the dropping
of the nuclear bomb.

40:57.570 --> 41:01.808
Which, by the way, was
dropped by LeMay's command.

41:04.678 --> 41:07.747
Proportionality should
be a guideline in war.

41:31.170 --> 41:34.473
Killing 50 to 90 percent

41:34.540 --> 41:37.610
of the people
in 67 Japanese cities

41:37.677 --> 41:41.147
and then bombing them
with two nuclear bombs

41:41.214 --> 41:45.051
is not proportional,
in the minds of some people

41:45.118 --> 41:48.354
to the objectives
we were trying to achieve.

42:04.570 --> 42:08.374
I don't fault Truman
for dropping the nuclear bomb.

42:08.441 --> 42:11.577
The U.S.-Japanese War was
one of the most brutal wars

42:11.644 --> 42:13.847
in all of human history.

42:13.913 --> 42:17.817
Kamikaze pilots, suicide,
unbelievable.

42:17.884 --> 42:19.418
What one can criticize,

42:19.485 --> 42:22.989
is that the human race
prior to that time and today

42:23.056 --> 42:25.591
has not really grappled

42:25.658 --> 42:27.693
with what are, I'll call it
"the rules of war."

42:27.761 --> 42:30.563
Was there a rule then that
said you shouldn't bomb,

42:30.629 --> 42:32.165
shouldn't kill,

42:32.231 --> 42:35.201
shouldn't burn to death
100,000 civilians in a night?

42:37.070 --> 42:39.072
LeMay said,
"If we'd lost the war

42:39.138 --> 42:42.175
we'd all have been prosecuted
as war criminals."

42:42.241 --> 42:44.643
And I think he's right.

42:45.979 --> 42:48.882
He, and I'd say I

42:48.948 --> 42:51.650
were behaving as
war criminals.

42:55.755 --> 42:59.859
LeMay recognized
that what he was doing

42:59.926 --> 43:02.628
would be thought immoral

43:02.695 --> 43:06.432
if his side had lost.

43:06.499 --> 43:08.601
But what makes it immoral
if you lose

43:08.667 --> 43:10.436
and not immoral if you win?

45:23.502 --> 45:26.505
JOHNSON: Okay, Bob.
MCNAMARA: Thank you.

45:36.950 --> 45:39.685
MORRIS:
At some point,
we have to approach Vietnam,

45:39.752 --> 45:41.587
and I want to know

45:41.654 --> 45:43.756
how you can best
set that up for me.

45:43.822 --> 45:45.959
Yeah, well, uh...

45:46.025 --> 45:50.363
that's a hard, hard question.
I think--

45:52.498 --> 45:56.569
I think we have to approach it
in the context of the
Cold War.

45:56.635 --> 45:59.538
But first I'll have
to talk about Ford.

45:59.605 --> 46:02.075
I've got to go back
to the end of the war.

46:14.520 --> 46:17.290
I had a terrible headache,

46:17.356 --> 46:22.061
so Marg drove me in to the
Air Force regional hospital.

46:22.128 --> 46:24.597
A week later, Marg came in

46:24.663 --> 46:27.133
many of the same symptoms.

46:27.200 --> 46:29.402
It's hard to believe,
and I don't think

46:29.468 --> 46:30.936
I've ever heard of
another case

46:31.004 --> 46:33.572
where two individuals,
husband and wife,

46:33.639 --> 46:36.575
came down, essentially,
at the same time with polio.

46:38.044 --> 46:41.680
We were both in the hospital
on V-J Day.

46:44.750 --> 46:46.152
A friend of mine said:

46:46.219 --> 46:49.155
"We're gonna find a
corporation in America
that needs

46:49.222 --> 46:51.524
"the advice and capabilities
of this extraordinary group

46:51.590 --> 46:53.226
"of people I'm going
to bring together.

46:53.292 --> 46:54.827
and you gotta be part it."

46:54.893 --> 46:57.863
I said, "To hell with it.
I'm going back to Harvard.

46:57.930 --> 47:00.933
That's what Marg and I
wanna do. I'm gonna spend my
life there."

47:01.000 --> 47:04.570
He said, "Look, Bob, you can't
pay Marg's hospital bills.

47:04.637 --> 47:07.140
You're crazy as hell."
He said, "By the way

47:07.206 --> 47:10.643
the company that most needs
our help in all the
U.S. is Ford."

47:10.709 --> 47:12.378
Well, I said,
"How'd you learn that?"

47:12.445 --> 47:15.881
Oh he said, "I read an article
in Life magazine."

47:15.948 --> 47:18.184
Of the top 1000 executives
at Ford Motor Company.

47:18.251 --> 47:21.987
I don't believe there were
10 college graduates

47:22.055 --> 47:24.357
and Henry Ford II
needed help.

47:26.759 --> 47:29.195
They were gonna give
us tests.

47:29.262 --> 47:30.696
Two full days of testing:

47:30.763 --> 47:32.465
intelligence tests,
achievement tests,

47:32.531 --> 47:35.034
personality tests,
you name it.

47:35.101 --> 47:37.103
This sounds absurd,
but I remember

47:37.170 --> 47:39.505
one of the questions
on one of the tests was:

47:39.572 --> 47:43.376
"Would you rather be a
florist or a coal miner?"

47:45.044 --> 47:47.080
I should tell you
I had been a florist.

47:47.146 --> 47:50.116
I worked as a florist during
some of my
Christmas vacations.

47:50.183 --> 47:51.517
I put down coal miner.

47:51.584 --> 47:56.122
I think the reasons
are obvious to you.

47:56.189 --> 47:59.558
This group of 10 people
had been trained

47:59.625 --> 48:02.395
in the officer candidate
school at Harvard.

48:02.461 --> 48:04.963
In some tests we actually had
the highest marks

48:05.030 --> 48:06.565
that had ever been scored.

48:06.632 --> 48:10.236
In other tests, we were
in the upper one percentile.

48:16.575 --> 48:20.179
From 1926 to 1946,
including the war years,

48:20.246 --> 48:23.516
Ford Motor Company
just barely broke even.

48:24.550 --> 48:26.552
It was a God-awful mess.

48:28.987 --> 48:31.357
I thought we had
a responsibility

48:31.424 --> 48:33.159
to the stockholders,

48:33.226 --> 48:35.894
and God knows
you cannot believe

48:35.961 --> 48:38.564
how bad the situation
had been.

48:55.881 --> 48:57.783
They didn't have a market
research organization.

48:57.850 --> 48:59.318
I set one up.

48:59.385 --> 49:01.420
The manager said to me,
"What do you want
me to study?"

49:01.487 --> 49:03.789
I said, "Find out who in the
hell is buying Volkswagens.

49:03.856 --> 49:06.024
"Everybody says it's
a no-good car.

49:06.091 --> 49:08.427
"It was only selling about
20,000 a year,

49:08.494 --> 49:10.729
"but I want to know
what's gonna happen.

49:10.796 --> 49:13.432
"Is it gonna stay the same,
go down, or go up?

49:13.499 --> 49:14.800
Find out who buys them."

49:14.867 --> 49:17.069
He came back six months later,
he said:

49:17.136 --> 49:19.138
"Well, they're professors,

49:19.205 --> 49:21.174
"and they're doctors,
and they're lawyers

49:21.240 --> 49:23.942
and they're obviously people
who can afford more."

49:24.009 --> 49:26.044
Well, that set me to thinking

49:26.111 --> 49:27.713
about what we in
the industry should do.

49:27.780 --> 49:31.049
Was there a market
we were missing?

49:31.116 --> 49:35.321
At this time nobody believed
Americans wanted
cheaper cars.

49:35.388 --> 49:39.292
They wanted conspicuous
consumption.

49:39.358 --> 49:43.128
Cadillac, with these huge,
ostentatious fins

49:43.196 --> 49:46.365
set the style for the
industry for 10 or 15 years.

49:48.066 --> 49:50.536
And that's what
we were up against.

49:52.671 --> 49:56.442
We introduced the Falcon
as a more economical car,

49:56.509 --> 50:00.179
and it was a huge success
profit-wise.

50:04.850 --> 50:07.152
We accomplished a lot.

50:14.126 --> 50:18.231
[CROWD CHATTERING]

50:22.335 --> 50:25.738
I said, "What about
accidents? I hear a lot
about accidents."

50:25.804 --> 50:29.041
"Oh, yes, we'll get you
some data on that."

50:33.045 --> 50:36.749
There were about 40-odd
thousand deaths per year

50:36.815 --> 50:38.384
from automobile accidents,

50:38.451 --> 50:40.453
and about a million,
or a million-two injuries.

50:40.519 --> 50:42.221
And I said,
"Well, what causes it?"

50:42.288 --> 50:43.756
Well he said, "It's obvious.

50:43.822 --> 50:46.459
It's human error
and mechanical failure."

50:46.525 --> 50:47.926
I said, "Hell, if it's
mechanical failure,

50:47.993 --> 50:49.695
"we might be involved.
Let's dig into this.

50:49.762 --> 50:52.197
I wanna know if it's
mechanical failure,
I want to stop it."

50:52.265 --> 50:55.801
Well, he said, "There's
really very few
statistics available."

50:55.868 --> 50:58.404
I said, "Damn it, find out
what can we learn."

50:58.471 --> 51:01.106
He said "Well, the only place
we can find

51:01.173 --> 51:03.642
that knows anything about it
is Cornell Aeronautical Labs."

51:03.709 --> 51:06.078
They said, "The major problem
is packaging."

51:06.144 --> 51:09.448
They said, "You buy eggs and
you know how eggs come
in a carton?"

51:09.515 --> 51:11.884
I said, "I don't buy eggs.
My wife does it."

51:11.950 --> 51:14.387
They said, "Well, talk to her
and you ask her,

51:14.453 --> 51:15.954
"when she puts that carton
down

51:16.021 --> 51:19.892
on the drain board when
she gets home, do the
eggs break?"

51:19.958 --> 51:21.727
And so I asked Marg
and she said no.

51:21.794 --> 51:23.496
So Cornell said,
"They don't break because

51:23.562 --> 51:24.730
"they're packaged properly.

51:24.797 --> 51:27.700
"Now, if we packaged people
in cars the same way

51:27.766 --> 51:29.968
we could reduce the breakage."

51:39.478 --> 51:42.515
We lacked lab facilities,
so we dropped human skulls

51:42.581 --> 51:44.182
in different packages,

51:44.249 --> 51:48.454
down the stairwells
of the dormitories
at Cornell.

51:50.389 --> 51:51.757
Well, that sounds absurd,

51:51.824 --> 51:54.593
but that guy was
absolutely right.

51:54.660 --> 51:58.731
It was packaging which
could make the difference.

52:07.340 --> 52:09.074
In a crash...

52:09.141 --> 52:14.212
the driver was often
impaled on the steering
wheel.

52:14.279 --> 52:19.084
The passenger was often
injured because he'd hit
the windshield

52:19.151 --> 52:22.254
or the header bar,
or the instrument panel.

52:24.723 --> 52:28.561
So in the 1956 model Ford
we introduced steering wheels

52:28.627 --> 52:31.196
that prevented being impaled.
We introduced

52:31.263 --> 52:35.033
padded instrument panels,
and we introduced seat belts.

52:36.602 --> 52:38.937
We estimated if there
would be

52:39.004 --> 52:40.673
100 percent use
of the seat belts

52:40.739 --> 52:43.709
we could save 20-odd thousand
lives a year.

52:43.776 --> 52:46.211
Everybody was opposed to it.

52:53.952 --> 52:57.055
You couldn't get people
to use seat belts.

52:57.122 --> 53:00.025
But those who did
saved their lives.

53:17.876 --> 53:19.978
Now, let me jump ahead.

53:28.020 --> 53:31.924
It's July, 1960.

53:31.990 --> 53:35.127
John Bugas, vice president,
industrial relations,

53:35.193 --> 53:38.431
clearly had his eyes on
becoming president.

53:38.497 --> 53:41.500
I'm the group vice president
in charge of all

53:41.567 --> 53:43.702
of the car divisions.

53:43.769 --> 53:46.539
Henry was a night owl.
He always wanted to go out
on the town.

53:46.605 --> 53:48.641
You know, it's 2 a.m.
or something or other.

53:48.707 --> 53:50.409
He said, "Bob, come on up,
have a nightcap."

53:50.476 --> 53:52.445
I said, "I don't want one,
I'm going to bed."

53:52.511 --> 53:53.912
John says,
"I'll come up, Henry."

53:53.979 --> 53:56.314
Henry said, "I didn't ask you,
John. I asked Bob."

53:56.381 --> 53:58.651
He said, "Bob, come on up."
So I finally went up.

53:58.717 --> 54:00.886
That's when he asked me
to be president.

54:04.657 --> 54:08.260
I was the first president
in the history of the company

54:08.326 --> 54:10.729
that had ever been president

54:10.796 --> 54:12.565
other than a member
of the Ford family.

54:12.631 --> 54:15.133
And after five weeks, I quit.

54:27.079 --> 54:28.714
The telephone rang,

54:28.781 --> 54:32.117
a person comes on and says:
"I'm Robert Kennedy.

54:32.184 --> 54:34.620
My brother, Jack Kennedy,
would like you

54:34.687 --> 54:38.190
to meet our brother-in-law,
Sergeant Shriver."

54:38.256 --> 54:40.726
Four o'clock,
Sarge comes in. Never met him.

54:40.793 --> 54:45.163
And he said, "I've been
authorized by my
brother-in-law

54:45.230 --> 54:47.633
"Jack Kennedy,
to offer you the position

54:47.700 --> 54:49.034
of secretary of the treasury."

54:49.101 --> 54:50.536
I said,
"You're out of your mind.

54:50.603 --> 54:52.204
"I know a little about
finance,

54:52.270 --> 54:53.939
but, I'm not qualified to be
secretary of the treasury."

54:54.006 --> 54:57.009
"Anticipating you might say
that, the president-elect

54:57.075 --> 55:00.012
authorized me to offer you
the secretary of defense."

55:00.078 --> 55:02.147
"Look, I was in World War II
for three years,

55:02.214 --> 55:03.716
"but secretary of defense?
I'm not qualified

55:03.782 --> 55:05.350
to be secretary of defense."

55:05.417 --> 55:06.985
He said, "Anticipating that

55:07.052 --> 55:10.422
would you do him the courtesy
of agreeing to meet with him?"

55:10.489 --> 55:13.559
So I go home. I meet
with Marg.

55:13.626 --> 55:17.763
If I could appoint every
senior official in the
department

55:17.830 --> 55:20.432
and if I could be guaranteed
I wouldn't have to

55:20.499 --> 55:23.235
be part of that damn
Washington social world.

55:23.301 --> 55:24.670
She said, "Well, okay...

55:24.737 --> 55:27.205
"why don't you write a
contract with the president

55:27.272 --> 55:29.842
and if he'll accept those
two conditions, do it."

55:29.908 --> 55:34.212
My total net worth at the time
was on the order of $800,000

55:34.279 --> 55:38.884
but I had huge unfulfilled
stock options worth millions.

55:38.951 --> 55:40.986
And I was one of the
highest-paid executives

55:41.053 --> 55:42.420
in the world.

55:42.487 --> 55:44.056
And the future was,
of course, brilliant.

55:45.991 --> 55:48.126
We had called our
children in.

55:48.193 --> 55:51.730
Their life would
be totally changed.

55:51.797 --> 55:54.032
The salary of a cabinet
secretary then

55:54.099 --> 55:56.434
was $25,000 a year.

55:56.501 --> 55:58.236
So we explained
to the children

55:58.303 --> 56:01.306
they'd be giving up a few--
They could care less.

56:01.373 --> 56:03.642
Marg could care less.

56:10.182 --> 56:12.217
It was snowing.

56:12.284 --> 56:17.422
The Secret Service took me
in the house by the back way.

56:17.489 --> 56:19.858
I can still see it.
There's a loveseat...

56:19.925 --> 56:23.028
two armchairs with
a lamp table in between.

56:23.095 --> 56:24.963
Jack Kennedy is sitting
in one armchair

56:25.030 --> 56:28.801
and Bobby Kennedy's sitting
in the other.

56:28.867 --> 56:32.838
"Mr. President, it's absurd.
I'm not qualified."

56:33.939 --> 56:35.440
"Look, Bob."

56:35.507 --> 56:37.275
He said, "I don't think
there's any school

56:37.342 --> 56:39.444
"for presidents either.

56:41.880 --> 56:44.717
He said "Let's announce
it now. I'll write the
announcement."

56:44.783 --> 56:47.019
So he wrote out
the announcement,

56:47.085 --> 56:48.721
we walk out the front door.

56:48.787 --> 56:51.624
All of these television
cameras and press,

56:51.690 --> 56:53.091
till hell wouldn't have it.

56:53.158 --> 56:55.327
That's how Marg learned
I had accepted.

56:55.393 --> 56:58.797
It was on television, live.

56:58.864 --> 57:02.234
All right, why don't we do
some pictures afterwards.

57:03.802 --> 57:06.371
I've asked Robert McNamara

57:06.438 --> 57:09.942
to assume the responsibilities
of secretary of defense.

57:10.008 --> 57:12.077
And I'm glad and happy to say

57:12.144 --> 57:14.479
that he has accepted
this responsibility.

57:14.546 --> 57:18.250
Mr. McNamara leaves the
presidency of the Ford company

57:18.316 --> 57:21.053
at great personal sacrifice.

57:22.287 --> 57:24.456
That's the way it began.

57:26.725 --> 57:29.127
You know, it was
a traumatic period.

57:29.194 --> 57:32.064
My wife probably
got ulcers from it,

57:32.130 --> 57:34.466
may even ultimately have died
from the stress.

57:34.532 --> 57:35.801
My son got ulcers.

57:35.868 --> 57:37.970
It was very traumatic but,

57:38.036 --> 57:40.639
they were some
of the best years of our life

57:40.706 --> 57:45.110
and all members of my family
benefited from it.

57:45.177 --> 57:47.379
It was terrific.

57:58.323 --> 58:00.492
October 2nd.

58:00.558 --> 58:04.229
I had returned from Vietnam.

58:04.296 --> 58:08.834
At that time, we had 16,000
military advisors.

58:10.803 --> 58:13.005
I recommended
to President Kennedy

58:13.071 --> 58:14.873
and to the Security Council

58:14.940 --> 58:18.911
that we establish a plan
and an objective

58:18.977 --> 58:21.914
of removing all
of them within two years.

58:57.816 --> 59:00.485
Kennedy announced
we were going to pull out

59:00.552 --> 59:01.686
all our military advisors

59:01.754 --> 59:03.255
by the end of '65,

59:03.321 --> 59:06.491
we're going to take 1000 out
at the end of '63, and we did.

59:08.626 --> 59:12.765
But there was a coup
in South Vietnam.

59:14.132 --> 59:17.069
Diem was overthrown

59:17.135 --> 59:19.704
and he and his brother
were killed.

59:21.539 --> 59:24.476
I was present
with the president

59:24.542 --> 59:28.046
when together we received
information of that coup.

59:28.113 --> 59:31.249
I've never seen him...

59:31.316 --> 59:35.087
more upset.
He totally blanched.

59:35.153 --> 59:39.457
Kennedy and I had tremendous
problems with Diem,
but my God,

59:39.524 --> 59:42.127
he was the authority.
He was the head of state.

59:42.194 --> 59:45.530
And he was overthrown
by a military coup.

59:45.597 --> 59:48.333
And Kennedy knew and I knew,
that to some degree

59:48.400 --> 59:51.336
the U.S. government was
responsible for that.

1:00:04.282 --> 1:00:08.186
I was in my office
in the Pentagon,

1:00:08.253 --> 1:00:13.591
when the telephone rang
and it was Bobby.

1:00:13.658 --> 1:00:17.229
The President had been shot
in Dallas.

1:00:20.298 --> 1:00:23.568
Perhaps 45 minutes later,
Bobby called again

1:00:23.635 --> 1:00:27.572
and said the president
was dead.

1:00:27.639 --> 1:00:31.844
Jackie would like me
to come out to the hospital.

1:00:31.910 --> 1:00:33.645
We took the body
to the White House

1:00:33.711 --> 1:00:35.680
about whatever it was,
4 a.m.

1:00:35.747 --> 1:00:39.952
and called the superintendent
of Arlington Cemetery.

1:00:40.018 --> 1:00:41.386
And he and I

1:00:44.857 --> 1:00:47.425
walked over those grounds.

1:00:48.994 --> 1:00:53.665
They're hauntingly
beautiful grounds.

1:00:53.731 --> 1:00:56.234
White crosses, row and row.

1:00:56.301 --> 1:01:00.338
And finally I thought I'd
found the exact spot

1:01:00.405 --> 1:01:02.674
the most beautiful spot
in the cemetery.

1:01:04.076 --> 1:01:06.044
I called Jackie
at the White House

1:01:06.111 --> 1:01:09.481
and asked her to
come out there.
She immediately accepted.

1:01:09.547 --> 1:01:13.385
And that's where the president
is buried today.

1:01:13.451 --> 1:01:18.590
A park service ranger came up
to me and said that he...

1:01:20.425 --> 1:01:22.294
He had...

1:01:24.129 --> 1:01:28.233
escorted President Kennedy
on a tour of those grounds

1:01:28.300 --> 1:01:30.502
a few weeks before.

1:01:30.568 --> 1:01:32.070
And Kennedy said

1:01:32.137 --> 1:01:35.407
that was the most
beautiful spot in Washington.

1:01:35.473 --> 1:01:37.775
That's where he's buried.

1:01:48.686 --> 1:01:51.623
I will do my best.

1:01:51.689 --> 1:01:55.627
That is all I can do.

1:01:55.693 --> 1:01:59.464
I ask for your help

1:01:59.531 --> 1:02:01.666
and God's.

1:03:43.301 --> 1:03:45.403
[EXPLOSIONS]

1:04:49.134 --> 1:04:51.469
GOLDWATER:
Make no bones of this.

1:04:51.536 --> 1:04:54.439
Don't try to sweep
this under the rug.

1:04:54.506 --> 1:04:59.077
We are at war in Vietnam.

1:04:59.144 --> 1:05:02.380
[CHEERING]

1:05:02.447 --> 1:05:04.282
And yet the president

1:05:04.349 --> 1:05:08.220
and his secretary of defense
continues to mislead

1:05:08.286 --> 1:05:11.089
and misinform
the American people,

1:05:11.156 --> 1:05:13.024
and enough of it's gone by.

1:05:38.816 --> 1:05:40.352
MCNAMARA:
On August 2nd

1:05:40.418 --> 1:05:43.188
the destroyer Maddox
reported it was attacked

1:05:43.255 --> 1:05:46.591
by a North Vietnamese
patrol boat.

1:05:46.658 --> 1:05:49.093
It was an act
of aggression against us.

1:05:49.161 --> 1:05:50.595
We were in
international waters.

1:05:50.662 --> 1:05:52.930
I sent officials
from the Defense Department

1:05:52.997 --> 1:05:54.199
out and we recovered

1:05:54.266 --> 1:05:55.933
pieces of North Vietnamese
shells,

1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:57.369
that were clearly identified

1:05:57.435 --> 1:05:59.671
as North Vietnamese shells
from the deck of the Maddox.

1:05:59.737 --> 1:06:02.674
So there was no question
in my mind that it
had occurred.

1:06:02.740 --> 1:06:06.010
But, in any event,
we didn't respond.

1:06:06.077 --> 1:06:08.380
And it was very difficult.

1:06:08.446 --> 1:06:10.548
It was difficult
for the president.

1:06:10.615 --> 1:06:13.050
There were very,
very senior people,

1:06:13.117 --> 1:06:14.352
in uniform and out, who said:

1:06:14.419 --> 1:06:17.121
"My God, this president is..."

1:06:17.189 --> 1:06:19.824
They didn't use the word
"coward," but in effect

1:06:19.891 --> 1:06:23.428
"He's not protecting
the national interest."

1:06:34.606 --> 1:06:39.010
Two days later the Maddox
and the Turner Joy,
two destroyers

1:06:39.076 --> 1:06:41.112
reported they were attacked.

1:06:49.954 --> 1:06:53.658
There were sonar soundings.
Torpedoes had been detected.

1:06:53.725 --> 1:06:57.094
Other indications of attack
from patrol boats.

1:06:57.161 --> 1:06:59.130
We spent about
10 hours that day

1:06:59.197 --> 1:07:03.100
trying to find out
what in the hell
had happened.

1:07:03.167 --> 1:07:05.136
At one point the commander
of the ship said,

1:07:05.203 --> 1:07:06.804
"We're not certain
of the attack."

1:07:06.871 --> 1:07:08.940
Another point they said,
"Yes, we're
absolutely positive."

1:07:09.006 --> 1:07:11.543
Then finally, late in the
day, Admiral Sharp said:

1:07:11.609 --> 1:07:15.213
"Yes, we're certain
it happened."

1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:19.684
So I reported this to
Johnson, and as a result...

1:07:19.751 --> 1:07:24.422
there were bombing attacks
on targets in North Vietnam.

1:07:38.670 --> 1:07:40.972
Johnson said,
"We may have to escalate.

1:07:41.038 --> 1:07:44.376
I'm not gonna do it without
Congressional authority."

1:07:44.442 --> 1:07:46.311
And he put forward
a resolution,

1:07:46.378 --> 1:07:47.645
the language of which

1:07:47.712 --> 1:07:50.748
gave complete authority to
the president

1:07:50.815 --> 1:07:52.917
to take the nation to war:

1:07:52.984 --> 1:07:55.687
The Tonkin Gulf Resolution.

1:07:58.189 --> 1:08:02.760
Now, let me go back
to the August 4th attack.

1:09:08.760 --> 1:09:14.599
It was just confusion.
And events afterwards showed

1:09:14.666 --> 1:09:19.136
that our judgment that we'd
been attacked that day was
wrong.

1:09:20.104 --> 1:09:22.006
It didn't happen.

1:09:25.877 --> 1:09:30.882
And the judgment that
we'd been attacked on
August 2nd

1:09:30.948 --> 1:09:34.118
which we'd made, was right.
We had been.

1:09:34.185 --> 1:09:37.889
Although that was disputed
at the time.

1:09:37.955 --> 1:09:41.426
So we were right once
and wrong once.

1:09:41.493 --> 1:09:45.129
Ultimately, President Johnson
authorized bombing in response

1:09:45.196 --> 1:09:47.999
to what he thought
had been the second attack.

1:09:48.065 --> 1:09:49.467
It hadn't occurred,

1:09:49.534 --> 1:09:51.769
but that's irrelevant
to the point I'm making here.

1:09:51.836 --> 1:09:55.673
He authorized the attack on
the assumption it
had occurred.

1:09:56.974 --> 1:10:01.713
And his belief that it was
a conscious decision

1:10:01.779 --> 1:10:03.748
on the part of the
North Vietnamese political

1:10:03.815 --> 1:10:04.816
and military leaders

1:10:04.882 --> 1:10:08.420
to escalate the conflict...

1:10:08.486 --> 1:10:12.457
and an indication they would
not stop short of winning.

1:10:17.462 --> 1:10:18.963
We were wrong.

1:10:19.030 --> 1:10:24.702
But we had in our minds a
mindset that led to
that action.

1:10:24.769 --> 1:10:27.905
And it carried
such heavy costs.

1:10:37.549 --> 1:10:39.383
We see incorrectly,

1:10:39.451 --> 1:10:43.187
or we see only half
of the story at times.

1:10:43.254 --> 1:10:45.156
MORRIS:
We see what we want
to believe.

1:10:45.222 --> 1:10:48.392
MCNAMARA: We see--
You're absolutely right.

1:10:50.027 --> 1:10:52.764
Belief and seeing.

1:10:52.830 --> 1:10:55.132
They're both often wrong.

1:11:01.573 --> 1:11:03.941
We Americans know,

1:11:04.008 --> 1:11:06.811
although others appear
to forget,

1:11:06.878 --> 1:11:10.748
the risk of spreading
conflict.

1:11:10.815 --> 1:11:14.552
We still seek no wider war.

1:11:35.172 --> 1:11:37.408
We introduced what was called
"Rolling Thunder"

1:11:37.475 --> 1:11:38.976
which, over the years,

1:11:39.043 --> 1:11:42.079
became a very,
very heavy bombing program.

1:11:42.146 --> 1:11:44.782
Two to three times
as many bombs as were dropped

1:11:44.849 --> 1:11:48.520
on Western Europe during
all of World War II.

1:12:07.705 --> 1:12:10.642
MCNAMARA:
This is not primarily
a military problem.

1:12:10.708 --> 1:12:13.410
It's a battle
for the hearts and minds

1:12:13.477 --> 1:12:17.481
of the people of
South Vietnam.

1:12:17.549 --> 1:12:20.484
As a prerequisite to that,
we must be able

1:12:20.552 --> 1:12:23.555
to guarantee
their physical security.

1:15:41.618 --> 1:15:43.120
ANNOUNCER:
It was announced today

1:15:43.187 --> 1:15:45.256
that total American
casualties in Vietnam

1:15:45.322 --> 1:15:50.327
now number 4877
including 748 killed.

1:15:50.394 --> 1:15:52.429
REASONER:
Secretary of Defense
Robert McNamara,

1:15:52.496 --> 1:15:55.366
on each of his seven
inspection trips to Vietnam,

1:15:55.432 --> 1:15:58.970
has found some positive aspect
of the course of
the war there.

1:15:59.036 --> 1:16:02.273
MCNAMARA:
The most vivid impression
I'm bringing back is

1:16:02.339 --> 1:16:04.375
that we've stopped
losing the war.

1:16:04.441 --> 1:16:06.143
The North Vietnamese today,
we believe,

1:16:06.210 --> 1:16:08.312
have nine regiments
of their army.

1:16:08.379 --> 1:16:10.547
ANNOUNCER:
Some of the men had
a little training

1:16:10.614 --> 1:16:13.317
in a state park in Kentucky
before coming here.

1:16:13.384 --> 1:16:16.020
But it didn't prepare them
for thicket of trees,

1:16:16.087 --> 1:16:17.855
spiked vines, thorn bushes

1:16:17.922 --> 1:16:19.924
almost perpendicular cliffs,

1:16:19.991 --> 1:16:21.859
90-degree temperatures,
insects.

1:16:21.926 --> 1:16:24.295
ANNOUNCER 2:
This has changed
from a nasty little war

1:16:24.361 --> 1:16:27.398
to a nasty middle-sized war.

1:16:27.464 --> 1:16:29.901
The Vietnamese are
still doing

1:16:29.967 --> 1:16:32.536
most of the fighting
and most of the dying,

1:16:32.603 --> 1:16:35.873
but week after week, American
casualty figures go up.

1:16:35.940 --> 1:16:39.576
JOHNSON:
Now, America wins the wars
that she undertakes.

1:16:39.643 --> 1:16:42.413
Make no mistake about it.

1:16:42.479 --> 1:16:47.718
And we have declared war
on tyranny and aggression.

1:16:47.785 --> 1:16:50.287
If this little nation
goes down the drain

1:16:50.354 --> 1:16:51.889
and can't
maintain independence

1:16:51.956 --> 1:16:53.858
ask yourself what's
gonna happen

1:16:53.925 --> 1:16:57.161
to all the other
little nations.

1:17:36.333 --> 1:17:40.237
MCNAMARA:
Let me go back one moment.

1:17:40.304 --> 1:17:43.975
In the Cuban Missile Crisis,
at the end...

1:17:44.041 --> 1:17:46.944
I think we did put ourselves

1:17:47.011 --> 1:17:50.481
in the skin of the Soviets.

1:17:51.648 --> 1:17:53.617
In the case of Vietnam,

1:17:53.684 --> 1:17:56.353
we didn't know
them well enough to
empathize.

1:17:56.420 --> 1:18:00.791
And there was total
misunderstanding as a result.

1:18:00.858 --> 1:18:04.896
They believed that we had
simply replaced the French

1:18:04.962 --> 1:18:06.363
as a colonial power,

1:18:06.430 --> 1:18:12.236
and we were seeking to subject
South and North Vietnam

1:18:12.303 --> 1:18:16.373
to our colonial interests,
which was absolutely absurd.

1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:21.913
And we, we saw Vietnam as
an element of the Cold War.

1:18:21.979 --> 1:18:26.217
Not what they saw it as,
a civil war.

1:18:37.761 --> 1:18:40.998
There aren't many examples

1:18:41.065 --> 1:18:46.270
in which you bring
two former enemies together

1:18:46.337 --> 1:18:48.605
at the highest levels,

1:18:48.672 --> 1:18:51.175
and discuss
what might have been.

1:18:53.210 --> 1:18:56.914
I formed the hypothesis
that each of us could have

1:18:56.981 --> 1:18:58.916
achieved our objectives

1:18:58.983 --> 1:19:02.053
without the terrible
loss of life.

1:19:02.119 --> 1:19:06.523
And I wanted to test that
by going to Vietnam.

1:19:08.759 --> 1:19:12.296
The former foreign minister
of Vietnam

1:19:12.363 --> 1:19:17.834
a wonderful man named Thach
said, "You're totally wrong.

1:19:17.901 --> 1:19:20.271
"We were fighting
for our independence.

1:19:20.337 --> 1:19:24.075
You were fighting
to enslave us."

1:19:24.141 --> 1:19:28.779
We almost came to blows.
That was noon on the
first day.

1:19:28.845 --> 1:19:33.850
"Do you mean to say it was
not a tragedy for you

1:19:33.917 --> 1:19:38.789
"when you lost 3,400,000
Vietnamese killed

1:19:38.855 --> 1:19:40.591
"which on our population base

1:19:40.657 --> 1:19:42.926
"is the equivalent of
27 million Americans?

1:19:42.994 --> 1:19:44.395
"What did you accomplish?

1:19:44.461 --> 1:19:46.063
"You didn't get any more
than we were willing

1:19:46.130 --> 1:19:47.898
"to give you at
the beginning of the war.

1:19:47.965 --> 1:19:49.900
"You could've had
the whole damn thing:

1:19:49.967 --> 1:19:53.137
"independence, unification."

1:19:53.204 --> 1:19:55.973
"Mr. McNamara, you must never
have read a history book.

1:19:56.040 --> 1:19:59.010
"If you had,
you'd know we weren't pawns

1:19:59.076 --> 1:20:01.912
"of the Chinese
or the Russians.

1:20:01.979 --> 1:20:03.414
"McNamara,
Didn't you know that?

1:20:03.480 --> 1:20:06.150
"Don't you understand that
we've been fighting

1:20:06.217 --> 1:20:09.320
"the Chinese for 1000 years?

1:20:09.386 --> 1:20:11.188
"We were fighting for our
independence,

1:20:11.255 --> 1:20:13.190
"and we'd fight
to the last man.

1:20:13.257 --> 1:20:14.791
"And we were determined
to do so.

1:20:14.858 --> 1:20:17.261
"And no amount of bombing,
no amount of U.S. pressure

1:20:17.328 --> 1:20:18.895
would've ever stopped us."

1:20:36.447 --> 1:20:38.982
What makes us omniscient?

1:20:41.085 --> 1:20:43.987
Have we a record
of omniscience?

1:20:48.392 --> 1:20:52.663
We are the strongest nation
in the world today.

1:20:52.729 --> 1:20:54.731
I do not believe we should
ever

1:20:54.798 --> 1:20:59.303
apply that economic,
political or military power
unilaterally.

1:21:01.405 --> 1:21:04.975
If we had followed
that rule in Vietnam,

1:21:05.042 --> 1:21:07.010
we wouldn't have been there.

1:21:10.647 --> 1:21:13.584
None of our allies
supported us.

1:21:13.650 --> 1:21:17.154
Not Japan, not Germany,
not Britain or France.

1:21:21.492 --> 1:21:24.928
If we can't persuade nations
with comparable values

1:21:24.995 --> 1:21:27.664
of the merit of our cause,

1:21:27.731 --> 1:21:30.534
we'd better reexamine
our reasoning.

1:21:39.276 --> 1:21:41.112
Americans suffered
the heaviest casualties

1:21:41.178 --> 1:21:42.746
of the war in Vietnam last
week.

1:21:42.813 --> 1:21:45.182
543 killed in action.

1:21:45.249 --> 1:21:48.719
Another 1247 were
wounded and hospitalized.

1:21:48.785 --> 1:21:53.657
The deaths raise the
U.S. total in the war so far
to 18,239.

1:21:53.724 --> 1:21:56.193
South Vietnamese put their
losses for the week

1:21:56.260 --> 1:21:57.628
at 522 killed.

1:21:57.694 --> 1:21:59.996
Communist losses
were not reported.

1:22:00.063 --> 1:22:01.932
Contributing to those
record casualties

1:22:01.998 --> 1:22:03.767
has been the steady
Communist bombardment

1:22:03.834 --> 1:22:06.170
of the Marine outpost
at Khe Sanh.

1:22:06.237 --> 1:22:07.671
There, the North Vietnamese

1:22:07.738 --> 1:22:09.273
have been tightening their
ring around around

1:22:09.340 --> 1:22:11.041
the two-square mile division.

1:22:11.108 --> 1:22:13.744
The military expects
a full-scale assault.

1:22:40.537 --> 1:22:42.439
MORRIS:
To what extent
did you feel

1:22:42.506 --> 1:22:43.940
that you were the
author of stuff

1:22:44.007 --> 1:22:46.343
or that you were
an instrument

1:22:46.410 --> 1:22:48.545
of things outside
of your control?

1:22:48.612 --> 1:22:51.815
Well, I don't think I felt
either.

1:22:51.882 --> 1:22:56.687
I just felt that I was serving
at the request of a president

1:22:56.753 --> 1:22:59.323
who'd been elected
by the American people.

1:22:59.390 --> 1:23:04.795
And it was my responsibility
to try to help him, uh...

1:23:04.861 --> 1:23:07.764
to carry out the office
as he believed

1:23:07.831 --> 1:23:09.700
was in the interest
of our people.

1:23:11.368 --> 1:23:15.339
[VOICE MUTED]

1:23:38.795 --> 1:23:44.735
MCNAMARA:
What is morally appropriate
in a wartime environment?

1:23:49.840 --> 1:23:52.743
Let me give you
an illustration.

1:23:59.483 --> 1:24:01.785
While I was secretary

1:24:01.852 --> 1:24:06.690
we used what's called
"Agent Orange" in Vietnam.

1:24:06.757 --> 1:24:12.095
A chemical that strips
leaves off of trees.

1:24:12.162 --> 1:24:17.067
After the war, it is claimed
that that was a
toxic chemical,

1:24:17.133 --> 1:24:20.537
and it killed many
individuals,

1:24:20.604 --> 1:24:25.576
soldiers and civilians
exposed to it.

1:24:25.642 --> 1:24:29.212
Were those who issued
the approval...

1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:31.815
to use Agent Orange,
criminals?

1:24:31.882 --> 1:24:34.951
Were they committing a crime
against humanity?

1:24:37.288 --> 1:24:39.155
Let's look at the law.

1:24:39.222 --> 1:24:41.825
Now, what kind of law
do we have that says

1:24:41.892 --> 1:24:44.295
these chemicals are acceptable
for use in war

1:24:44.361 --> 1:24:46.129
and these chemicals are not.

1:24:46.196 --> 1:24:48.732
We don't have clear
definitions of that kind.

1:24:48.799 --> 1:24:55.439
I never in the world
would have authorized an
illegal action.

1:24:55.506 --> 1:24:57.474
I'm not really sure I
authorized Agent Orange,

1:24:57.541 --> 1:24:58.875
I don't remember it.

1:24:58.942 --> 1:25:00.477
But it certainly occurred,

1:25:00.544 --> 1:25:03.747
the use of it occurred
while I was secretary.

1:25:22.633 --> 1:25:26.903
Norman Morrison was a Quaker.

1:25:26.970 --> 1:25:28.539
He was opposed to war,

1:25:28.605 --> 1:25:30.707
the violence of war,
the killing.

1:25:30.774 --> 1:25:34.311
He came to the Pentagon,

1:25:34.378 --> 1:25:37.213
doused himself with gasoline.

1:25:39.149 --> 1:25:42.218
Burned himself to death
below my office.

1:25:45.456 --> 1:25:49.526
He held a child in his arms,
his daughter.

1:25:49.593 --> 1:25:51.562
Passersby shouted,
"Save the child!"

1:25:51.628 --> 1:25:54.665
He threw the child
out of his arms,

1:25:54.731 --> 1:25:57.534
and the child lived
and is alive today.

1:25:57.601 --> 1:26:01.037
His wife issued
a very moving statement:

1:26:01.104 --> 1:26:07.043
"Human beings must stop
killing other human beings."

1:26:07.110 --> 1:26:09.380
And that's a belief
that I shared.

1:26:09.446 --> 1:26:13.750
I shared it then and I believe
it even more strongly today.

1:26:13.817 --> 1:26:19.122
How much evil must we do
in order to do good?

1:26:19.189 --> 1:26:23.427
We have certain ideals,
certain responsibilities.

1:26:23.494 --> 1:26:27.197
Recognize that at times you
will have to engage in evil,

1:26:27.263 --> 1:26:30.901
but minimize it.

1:26:34.971 --> 1:26:37.374
I remember reading that
General Sherman,

1:26:37.441 --> 1:26:39.009
in the Civil War,

1:26:39.075 --> 1:26:43.447
the mayor of Atlanta pleaded
with him to save the city.

1:26:43.514 --> 1:26:45.782
And Sherman essentially
said to the mayor

1:26:45.849 --> 1:26:49.520
just before he torched it
and burned it down:

1:26:49.586 --> 1:26:54.157
"War is cruel.
War is cruelty."

1:26:54.224 --> 1:26:56.927
That was the way LeMay felt.

1:26:56.993 --> 1:26:59.362
He was trying to save
the country.

1:26:59.430 --> 1:27:03.500
He was trying
to save our nation.

1:27:03.567 --> 1:27:06.102
And in the process,

1:27:06.169 --> 1:27:09.305
he was prepared to do
whatever killing was
necessary.

1:27:12.509 --> 1:27:16.046
It's a very,
very difficult position

1:27:16.112 --> 1:27:18.248
for sensitive human beings
to be in.

1:27:18.314 --> 1:27:22.385
Morrison was one of those.
I think I was.

1:27:29.025 --> 1:27:32.663
50,000 people came
to Washington

1:27:32.729 --> 1:27:35.799
to demonstrate against
the war.

1:27:38.735 --> 1:27:41.738
About 20,000 of them marched
on the Pentagon.

1:27:47.110 --> 1:27:51.882
The Pentagon is a very, very
difficult building to defend.

1:27:51.948 --> 1:27:55.886
We placed troops carrying
rifles around it.

1:27:55.952 --> 1:28:00.924
U.S. marshals in front
of the soldiers.

1:28:00.991 --> 1:28:05.161
But I told the president,
not a rifle would be loaded

1:28:05.228 --> 1:28:07.464
without my
personal permission.

1:28:07.531 --> 1:28:10.033
And I wasn't gonna grant it.

1:28:15.806 --> 1:28:20.944
[CROWD JEERING]

1:28:45.135 --> 1:28:50.340
MORRIS:
What effect did all of this
dissent have on your thinking?

1:28:50.406 --> 1:28:53.677
I mean, Norman Morrison
is '65. This is '67.

1:28:53.744 --> 1:28:57.981
Well, it was a very
tense period.

1:28:58.048 --> 1:29:02.619
Very tense period for my
family, which I don't want
to discuss.

1:29:05.088 --> 1:29:08.959
MORRIS:
How was your thinking changing
during this period?

1:29:10.594 --> 1:29:13.129
I don't think my thinking
was changing.

1:29:13.196 --> 1:29:18.669
We were in the Cold War.
And this was a Cold War...

1:29:20.170 --> 1:29:22.005
activity.

1:30:10.954 --> 1:30:13.724
Some commentators here
have said that the war

1:30:13.790 --> 1:30:15.859
is turning into
a kind of stalemate.

1:30:15.926 --> 1:30:18.795
No, no.
I think on the contrary

1:30:18.862 --> 1:30:22.032
as General Westmoreland
has pointed out...

1:30:22.098 --> 1:30:25.869
in recent weeks in Saigon,
the military operations

1:30:25.936 --> 1:30:29.606
the large-unit military
operations continue to...

1:30:29.673 --> 1:30:32.743
show very
substantial progress.

1:30:41.417 --> 1:30:46.222
MCNAMARA:
One of the lessons I learned
early on: never say never.

1:30:46.289 --> 1:30:48.892
Never, never, never.

1:30:48.959 --> 1:30:51.194
Never say never.

1:30:52.162 --> 1:30:54.297
And secondly...

1:30:54.364 --> 1:30:58.935
never answer the question
that is asked of you.

1:30:59.002 --> 1:31:05.008
Answer the question that you
wish had been asked of you.

1:31:05.075 --> 1:31:08.745
And quite frankly,
I follow that rule.

1:31:08.812 --> 1:31:10.914
It's a very good rule.

1:31:20.657 --> 1:31:23.326
MORRIS:
When you talk about
the responsibility

1:31:23.393 --> 1:31:26.930
for something like
the Vietnam War...

1:31:29.565 --> 1:31:31.567
whose responsibility
is it?

1:31:31.634 --> 1:31:34.637
It's the president's
responsibility.

1:31:34.705 --> 1:31:37.440
I don't want
to fail to recognize

1:31:37.507 --> 1:31:39.776
the tremendous contribution
I think Johnson

1:31:39.843 --> 1:31:41.477
made to the country.

1:31:41.544 --> 1:31:43.680
I don't want
to put the responsibility

1:31:43.747 --> 1:31:46.482
for Vietnam on
his shoulders alone,

1:31:46.549 --> 1:31:48.719
but I do--
I am inclined to believe

1:31:48.785 --> 1:31:50.053
that if Kennedy had lived

1:31:50.120 --> 1:31:51.722
he would've made a difference.

1:31:51.788 --> 1:31:54.557
I don't think we would've
have had 500,000 men there.

1:31:58.729 --> 1:32:01.698
Two very telling photographs.

1:32:01.765 --> 1:32:05.168
One of them has Johnson
like this:

1:32:05.235 --> 1:32:07.037
You can just see him
thinking,

1:32:07.103 --> 1:32:10.473
"My God, I'm in a hell
of a mess.

1:32:10.540 --> 1:32:13.309
"And this guy is trying
to tell me to do something

1:32:13.376 --> 1:32:16.479
"that I know is wrong
and I'm not gonna do.

1:32:16.546 --> 1:32:20.416
But how the hell
am I gonna get out of this?"

1:32:20.483 --> 1:32:22.485
The other photograph,
you can just see me saying:

1:32:22.552 --> 1:32:25.889
"Jesus Christ. I love
this man, I respect him,

1:32:25.956 --> 1:32:27.223
"but he's totally wrong.

1:32:27.290 --> 1:32:30.060
What am I gonna do?"

1:32:30.126 --> 1:32:34.898
Johnson couldn't persuade me,
and I couldn't persuade him.

1:32:36.867 --> 1:32:40.536
I had this enormous respect
and affection, loyalty

1:32:40.603 --> 1:32:42.672
to both Kennedy and Johnson.

1:32:42.739 --> 1:32:47.978
But at the end, Johnson and I
found ourselves poles apart.

1:32:48.044 --> 1:32:51.147
And I said to a very close and
dear friend of mine,

1:32:51.214 --> 1:32:53.884
Kay Graham former publisher
of The Washington Post:

1:32:53.950 --> 1:32:55.318
"Even to this day, Kay,

1:32:55.385 --> 1:32:58.354
I don't know whether
I quit or was fired."

1:32:58.421 --> 1:32:59.990
She said, "You're out
of your mind.

1:33:00.056 --> 1:33:01.191
Of course, you were fired."

1:33:10.566 --> 1:33:14.938
November 1, 1967.

1:33:17.140 --> 1:33:20.310
I presented a memo
to Johnson that said:

1:33:20.376 --> 1:33:24.180
"The course we're on
is totally wrong.

1:33:24.247 --> 1:33:26.349
"We've gotta change it.

1:33:29.019 --> 1:33:32.288
"Cut back at what we're
doing in Vietnam.

1:33:34.724 --> 1:33:38.829
We gotta reduce
the casualties," and so on.

1:33:41.531 --> 1:33:44.267
It was an extraordinarily
controversial memo.

1:33:44.334 --> 1:33:48.071
And I took it to him.
I delivered it myself.

1:33:48.138 --> 1:33:50.106
"Mr. President,
nobody has seen this.

1:33:50.173 --> 1:33:55.045
Not Dean Rusk, not the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
Nobody."

1:33:55.111 --> 1:33:59.182
"I know that it may contain
recommendations and statements

1:33:59.249 --> 1:34:01.484
that you do not agree
with and do not support."

1:34:06.890 --> 1:34:09.025
I never heard from him.

1:34:14.564 --> 1:34:17.033
Something had to give.

1:34:23.006 --> 1:34:25.675
There was a rumor I was
facing a mental breakdown

1:34:25.741 --> 1:34:28.444
I was under such
pressure and stress.

1:34:31.614 --> 1:34:34.650
I don't think that
was the case at all.

1:34:38.688 --> 1:34:42.458
But it was a really
traumatic departure.

1:34:46.997 --> 1:34:49.232
That's the way it ended.

1:34:54.204 --> 1:34:56.539
Except for one thing.

1:34:58.741 --> 1:35:02.378
He awarded me
the Medal of Freedom

1:35:02.445 --> 1:35:06.382
in a very beautiful ceremony
at the White House.

1:35:06.449 --> 1:35:11.321
And he was very, very
warm in his comments.

1:35:11.387 --> 1:35:14.757
And I became so emotional,
I could not...

1:35:14.824 --> 1:35:16.792
respond.

1:35:20.430 --> 1:35:24.067
[APPLAUSE]

1:35:27.870 --> 1:35:29.906
MCNAMARA:
Mr. President

1:35:31.374 --> 1:35:33.876
I cannot find words

1:35:35.478 --> 1:35:38.781
to express what lies
in my heart today.

1:35:41.684 --> 1:35:45.088
And I think I'd better respond
on another occasion.

1:35:54.797 --> 1:35:57.800
And had I responded,
I would have said:

1:35:57.867 --> 1:36:00.403
"I know what many of you
are thinking.

1:36:00.470 --> 1:36:03.173
"You're thinking this man
is duplicitous.

1:36:03.239 --> 1:36:08.244
"You're thinking that he has
held things close to
his chest.

1:36:08.311 --> 1:36:11.314
"You're thinking that...

1:36:11.381 --> 1:36:14.750
"he did not respond fully

1:36:14.817 --> 1:36:17.820
"to the desires and wishes
of the American people.

1:36:17.887 --> 1:36:20.090
And I wanna tell you
you're wrong."

1:36:20.156 --> 1:36:24.660
Of course he had
personal idiosyncrasies.

1:36:24.727 --> 1:36:26.796
No question about that.

1:36:26.862 --> 1:36:31.467
He didn't accept all
the advice he was given.

1:36:31.534 --> 1:36:33.970
On several occasions,

1:36:34.037 --> 1:36:37.773
his associates advised him
to be more forthcoming.

1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:39.809
He wasn't.

1:36:42.045 --> 1:36:43.946
People did not
understand at that time

1:36:44.014 --> 1:36:46.016
there were
recommendations and pressures

1:36:46.082 --> 1:36:48.218
that would carry the risk of
war with China

1:36:48.284 --> 1:36:49.719
and carry the risk
of nuclear war.

1:36:49.785 --> 1:36:52.522
And he was determined
to prevent it.

1:36:57.027 --> 1:36:59.962
I'm arguing that
he had a reason

1:37:00.030 --> 1:37:03.366
in his mind for doing
what he did.

1:37:06.269 --> 1:37:09.739
And, of course,
shortly after I left

1:37:09.805 --> 1:37:14.177
Johnson concluded
that he couldn't continue.

1:37:22.652 --> 1:37:24.287
MORRIS:
And at this point,

1:37:24.354 --> 1:37:27.857
how many Americans
had been killed in Vietnam?

1:37:27.923 --> 1:37:32.762
About 25,000.
Less than half

1:37:32.828 --> 1:37:36.166
of the number
ultimately killed, 58,000.

1:38:39.028 --> 1:38:44.367
Historians don't really like
to deal with counterfactuals,

1:38:44.434 --> 1:38:46.669
with what might have been.

1:38:52.108 --> 1:38:55.111
They want to talk
about history.

1:38:55.178 --> 1:38:59.349
"How the hell do you know,
McNamara, what might
have been?

1:38:59.415 --> 1:39:01.284
Who knows?"

1:39:02.652 --> 1:39:05.455
Well, I know certain things.

1:39:14.096 --> 1:39:17.099
What I'm doing is thinking
it through with hindsight.

1:39:17.167 --> 1:39:20.470
But you don't have hindsight
available at the time.

1:39:20.536 --> 1:39:24.274
I'm very proud
of my accomplishments.

1:39:24.340 --> 1:39:28.144
And I'm very sorry that in
the process of
accomplishing things,

1:39:28.211 --> 1:39:29.445
I've made errors.

1:39:56.506 --> 1:39:59.842
We all make mistakes.

1:39:59.909 --> 1:40:02.678
We know we make mistakes.

1:40:05.615 --> 1:40:08.751
I don't know any military
commander, who is honest,

1:40:08.818 --> 1:40:12.255
who would say he has not
made a mistake.

1:40:16.392 --> 1:40:19.161
There's a wonderful phrase:

1:40:19.229 --> 1:40:21.664
"The fog of war."

1:40:23.466 --> 1:40:25.301
What "the fog of war"
means is:

1:40:25.368 --> 1:40:29.405
War is so complex it's beyond
the ability of the human mind

1:40:29.472 --> 1:40:32.308
to comprehend
all the variables.

1:40:33.843 --> 1:40:37.012
Our judgment,
our understanding,

1:40:37.079 --> 1:40:39.515
are not adequate.

1:40:41.083 --> 1:40:44.587
And we kill people
unnecessarily.

1:40:48.724 --> 1:40:52.362
Wilson said, "We won the
war to end all wars."

1:40:52.428 --> 1:40:56.031
[CHEERING]

1:41:02.938 --> 1:41:05.908
I'm not so naive
or simplistic

1:41:05.975 --> 1:41:09.144
to believe we
can eliminate war.

1:41:11.180 --> 1:41:14.517
We're not gonna change
human nature any time soon.

1:41:24.694 --> 1:41:28.264
It isn't that we aren't
rational. We are rational.

1:41:29.265 --> 1:41:31.567
But reason has limits.

1:41:48.984 --> 1:41:54.056
There's a quote from
T.S. Eliot that I just love:

1:41:55.157 --> 1:41:58.994
"We shall not cease
from exploring

1:41:59.061 --> 1:42:01.831
"and at the end of
our exploration,

1:42:01.897 --> 1:42:05.067
"we will return
to where we started

1:42:05.134 --> 1:42:08.203
and know the place
for the first time."

1:42:08.270 --> 1:42:11.674
Now that's, in a sense,
where I'm beginning to be.

1:42:29.124 --> 1:42:32.395
MORRIS [ON PHONE]:
After you left
the Johnson administration

1:42:32.462 --> 1:42:36.432
why didn't you speak out
against the Vietnam War?

1:42:39.669 --> 1:42:43.305
MCNAMARA:
I'm not going to say any more
than I have.

1:42:43.373 --> 1:42:45.274
These are the kinds
of questions

1:42:45.341 --> 1:42:47.477
that get me in trouble.

1:42:47.543 --> 1:42:52.114
You don't know what I know
about how inflammatory

1:42:52.181 --> 1:42:54.316
my words can appear.

1:42:58.421 --> 1:43:02.792
A lot of people
misunderstand the war,

1:43:02.858 --> 1:43:06.295
misunderstand me.

1:43:06.362 --> 1:43:11.266
A lot of people think
I'm a son of a bitch.

1:43:11.333 --> 1:43:14.470
MORRIS:
Do you feel in any way
responsible for the war?

1:43:14.537 --> 1:43:16.706
Do you feel guilty?

1:43:16.772 --> 1:43:19.141
MCNAMARA:
I don't want to go into
further discussion.

1:43:19.208 --> 1:43:22.211
It just opens up
more controversy.

1:43:23.479 --> 1:43:25.515
I don't wanna add anything
to Vietnam.

1:43:25.581 --> 1:43:27.683
It is so complex that
anything I say

1:43:27.750 --> 1:43:32.187
will require additions
and qualifications.

1:43:36.091 --> 1:43:38.994
MORRIS:
Is it the feeling that
you're damned if you do

1:43:39.061 --> 1:43:41.096
and if you don't,
no matter what--?

1:43:41.163 --> 1:43:43.065
MCNAMARA:
Yeah, that's right.

1:43:45.701 --> 1:43:49.171
And I would rather
be damned if I don't.

1:44:12.828 --> 1:44:17.232
[**]
