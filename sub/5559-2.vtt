WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:03.437
Previously
on Minority Report...

00:03.471 --> 00:05.273
Can you see?

00:05.306 --> 00:06.774
You're one of them.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.442
I'm tired
of picking up the pieces.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.711
Just once, I need to stop one
before it happens.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.146
We promised not to intervene.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.781
You know
how much I see out here.

00:13.814 --> 00:14.715
(shouts)

00:14.748 --> 00:16.284
I can't let this happen.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.186
We need to go to Arthur.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.287
How much is this gonna cost me?

00:19.320 --> 00:21.155
Conversation for another time.

00:21.189 --> 00:22.290
(shouts)

00:22.323 --> 00:23.524
No!

00:23.557 --> 00:25.826
(shouting)

00:25.859 --> 00:27.328
You need to go.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.397
You're still seeing it,
your vision.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.099
We got to tell Dash.
No.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.501
Not until we know
what role he plays.

00:37.305 --> 00:40.441
MAN:
So that's it, huh?
Sorry?

00:40.474 --> 00:44.145
That's the... the milk bath?

00:46.547 --> 00:49.783
Photonic containment system.

00:49.817 --> 00:52.453
Helps unite them in a hive mind,

00:52.486 --> 00:55.789
combines their visions into
a clearer picture of the future.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.391
I see.

00:57.425 --> 01:02.296
So... time to get 'em out now,
huh?

01:04.165 --> 01:06.134
Do you have a plan?

01:06.167 --> 01:08.369
Not one that I'm going to share
with you.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.703
I've taken care
of them

01:09.737 --> 01:12.573
since you were
playing paintball at Langley.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.409
That's C.I.A.
I'm D.I.A.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.445
But... okay.

01:23.884 --> 01:26.387
Which one's Dash, hmm?

01:26.420 --> 01:28.256
They have names?

01:28.289 --> 01:30.258
Yes, they have names.
You know why?

01:30.291 --> 01:33.861
Because they're people.

01:33.894 --> 01:36.864
When they went in,
they were kids,

01:36.897 --> 01:38.599
each one different
from the other,

01:38.632 --> 01:40.601
just like all kids
are different.

01:40.634 --> 01:43.171
Okay.

01:51.545 --> 01:55.349
Agatha becomes the person
whose future she predicts.

01:55.383 --> 01:57.618
It's like she leaves herself.

01:57.651 --> 02:00.354
Arthur's mind
is an antennae,

02:00.388 --> 02:03.891
pulling in names, facts,
information.

02:03.924 --> 02:07.461
Made him one manipulative
little kid.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.332
But Dash, Dash...

02:11.365 --> 02:14.202
sees the horror.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.305
Imagine being

02:17.338 --> 02:21.909
an eyewitness to murders
you can't do anything to stop.

02:21.942 --> 02:25.846
Seems like someone got attached.

02:27.648 --> 02:31.219
They need to be prepared.

02:31.252 --> 02:35.789
Because I'm not so sure they'll
do well out there in the world.

02:35.823 --> 02:39.827
Well, we'll find out now,
won't we?

03:09.323 --> 03:12.660
(whirring)

03:23.737 --> 03:27.375
MALE VOICE:
The cow says...
(mooing)

03:30.478 --> 03:33.281
Hey.
Hey.

03:33.281 --> 03:35.316
You playing
or what?

03:39.653 --> 03:40.854
Check.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.424
Check.

03:44.658 --> 03:45.426
Check.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.862
Checkmate.
I haven't even moved yet.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.610
Sorry.

04:04.312 --> 04:07.915
(gasps)
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.983
(shouts)

04:10.017 --> 04:11.885
(woman screams, grunts)

04:16.624 --> 04:18.058
(woman screams)

04:18.091 --> 04:20.828
(panting)
MAN:
Hey, buddy, are you okay?

04:23.797 --> 04:25.666
Is everything all right?
Do you need help?

04:25.699 --> 04:28.336
Forgot your winnings, man!
Shh.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.807
VEGA:
There were three of them,

04:33.841 --> 04:36.344
Dash, Arthur, and Agatha.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.879
They were called
the Precognitives.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.749
They could see murders
before they happened.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.618
For six years, our police
held them against their will

04:44.652 --> 04:46.754
and used them to save lives.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.890
But after the government's
Precrime program was shut down,

04:49.923 --> 04:52.960
they were finally released.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.829
They kept themselves safe
and hidden from the world

04:55.863 --> 04:58.366
until now.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.473
(whirring)

05:11.144 --> 05:13.981
Wait, so you don't
know Sylk Diva?

05:14.014 --> 05:16.384
She's, like, the next
big thing out of Lagos.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.387
Sino-Afro pop, baby.
I'll stick with BeyoncÃ©.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.688
Wait, who's that again?

05:21.622 --> 05:22.590
Kidding, kidding.

05:22.623 --> 05:23.691
I like the oldies.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.025
Classics.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.827
Sniper, three o'clock.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.396
(screams)

05:32.633 --> 05:34.802
Akeela, I need a readout.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.604
So, is, uh, now a good time

05:36.637 --> 05:39.039
to talk
about my Christmas bonus?
Ha-ha.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.643
Go. Go, go.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.711
Corran, corran.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.579
Corran!

05:48.682 --> 05:50.518
Lenses, show me thermal.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.691
I see five more
on our ten and two.
All right.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.893
We go together.
No. You cover me.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.929
Wait, Vega, don't be stupid.
Vega.

06:05.032 --> 06:05.799
(shouts)

06:05.833 --> 06:06.867
Uno.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.669
Dos.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.503
(grunts)

06:09.537 --> 06:10.738
Tres.

06:10.771 --> 06:11.805
(grunts)

06:11.839 --> 06:14.442
Cuatro.
(shouting)

06:16.176 --> 06:16.877
Cinco.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.979
(grunts)

06:28.155 --> 06:30.991
Well, you forgot about seis.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.730
(sighs)
Akeela.

06:36.764 --> 06:40.100
What the hell?
Don't shoot the admin,
girlfriend.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.869
I just run the system.

06:43.537 --> 06:46.139
(clears throat)

06:51.044 --> 06:53.013
That's your idea
of covering me, Blake?

06:53.046 --> 06:54.882
That's your idea
of teamwork, Vega?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.884
Last time I checked,
you weren't my partner anymore.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.219
You were my...
Boss. Yeah. Ooh,
that never gets old.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.188
But it does remind me.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.057
I've been cleaning up your mess
all week on the Rutledge case.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.059
Mess? I stopped
a terrorist attack.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.195
Yeah, and you killed
two suspects.

07:08.228 --> 07:11.632
Without your body
camera operational.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.133
The feds are asking questions.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.502
Like?

07:14.502 --> 07:15.769
How you did all that.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.204
Alone.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.872
Right place, right time.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.541
That threat wasn't even
on their radar.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.042
Good police work, I guess.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.944
But feel free to take the credit
for it.

07:23.977 --> 07:27.080
Oh, I did. I also told
them that if you had help,

07:27.114 --> 07:30.584
say an informant,
that I'd be the first to know.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.053
So...

07:33.086 --> 07:35.055
did you?

07:35.088 --> 07:37.525
Did you have help?

07:37.525 --> 07:39.527
You know me, Will.

07:39.527 --> 07:42.530
I'm always better
when I work alone.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.639
Nice shooting back there.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.241
Thanks. I heard
Blake was wondering

07:54.274 --> 07:55.843
about the Rutledge case.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.845
How I took down
two armed suspects by myself.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.046
I know.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.715
He say anything to you?

08:01.749 --> 08:02.816
No.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.718
But... others have.

08:04.752 --> 08:07.555
Your report says
Rutledge fell

08:07.555 --> 08:10.724
three stories trying to get away
as you went to arrest him.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.225
But the forensics
don't line up.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.194
He didn't just
trip and fall.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.963
He was pushed.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.633
What do you say?

08:19.667 --> 08:21.869
I told them

08:21.902 --> 08:22.970
that if Vega

08:23.003 --> 08:24.772
says something happened,

08:24.805 --> 08:26.273
then that's what happened.

08:26.306 --> 08:29.176
I owe you, Akeela.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.579
Lara.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.950
Is there something
you want to tell me?

08:36.984 --> 08:40.988
I know it's not your first time,
but you killed two people.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.157
I'm fine.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.227
I thought I was your friend.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.764
(sighs)

08:50.798 --> 08:53.601
You are.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.969
That's why I can't tell you.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.711
(woman screams)

09:03.744 --> 09:06.113
WALLY:
Okay, okay,
okay, okay.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.215
That's it.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.284
Ah.

09:11.318 --> 09:14.087
(exhales)

09:14.121 --> 09:17.625
(pants)
Did you get it?

09:17.658 --> 09:19.693
Yeah, it's processing, but...

09:19.727 --> 09:21.695
your brain takes a
beating every time.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.764
I'm gonna have to find a
better way of doing this.

09:23.797 --> 09:26.867
(groans)
(doorbell rings)

09:30.638 --> 09:32.806
Took you long enough, Detective.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.642
I was wondering
if you'd come.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.810
I told you not to call me
at the precinct.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.746
The feds are asking questions
about Rutledge.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.080
Feds? Were you followed?

09:40.113 --> 09:41.882
Relax. I'm careful.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.350
Well, what
do they know?

09:43.383 --> 09:45.986
Well, nothing yet.
But you need to lay low.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.320
If anyone finds out
I'm working with a Precog,

09:47.354 --> 09:49.022
they'll throw me off the force
and in jail.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.058
Not to mention what happens
to him if you slip up.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.826
You know, like enslavement?

09:52.860 --> 09:54.662
Lab tests?
Vivisections?

09:54.662 --> 09:56.664
But, uh, I-I know. A slap
on the wrist by your superiors

09:56.664 --> 09:58.766
would be a real boo-hoo.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.334
I get it.
We both need to be careful.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.937
I hacked

10:03.971 --> 10:05.172
the public surveillance grid
around the Rutledge scene,

10:05.205 --> 10:07.007
erased
the feeds.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.743
There's no evidence
that he was ever there.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.679
Please tell me
that's harder than it sounds.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.747
Whatever helps you sleep,
Detective.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.282
Are you having second thoughts?

10:15.315 --> 10:17.951
No. I'm happy you called.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.253
Okay, here we go.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.094
(woman screams)
Is this the new vision?

10:27.127 --> 10:29.096
Yeah. It's a woman.
The-the victim.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.031
The killer looks
like a man.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.066
That narrows it down.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.704
Why can't we see their faces?

10:36.737 --> 10:38.338
It's just how it
happens sometimes.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.407
I get impressions, details.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.642
Can you help?

10:43.944 --> 10:46.714
(man grunting)

10:46.747 --> 10:49.316
Okay, a... dark-haired woman.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.118
A struggle.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.021
She kicks him, loses a shoe.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.861
(exhales)

11:00.894 --> 11:03.396
Then it happens.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.869
Oh! What's that?

11:08.902 --> 11:09.803
That symbol.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.339
(whooshing)

11:12.372 --> 11:14.842
I have no clue...

11:14.875 --> 11:16.777
except that it must be one.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.378
Wally, do we know when
the murder's going to happen?

11:18.411 --> 11:19.913
Hard to say.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.448
In Precrime,
the time horizon would vary.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.851
Anywhere from 36 to 48 hours,

11:23.884 --> 11:25.953
depending on the level
of premeditation.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.755
But that's with all
three Precogs

11:27.788 --> 11:29.289
in the milk bath.
We saw more clearly

11:29.322 --> 11:30.758
as a hive mind.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.259
So?

11:32.292 --> 11:35.062
Three days was the most
from vision to murder.

11:35.095 --> 11:38.899
But we do know that this
happens after dark, so

11:38.932 --> 11:40.300
it could be
as soon as tonight.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.169
Her wrist.
Hold it there.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.037
(whooshing)

11:44.071 --> 11:45.773
Alpha?

11:45.806 --> 11:49.276
Club Alpha. It's a singles spot
near Dupont Circle.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.381
I get out.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.483
Occasionally.

11:56.516 --> 11:59.219
Okay, well, that must be where
the murderer finds our victim.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.154
But how do we
find them?

12:01.188 --> 12:03.190
All we know is
that she's got brown hair

12:03.223 --> 12:04.524
and a weird pair of shoes.

12:04.557 --> 12:08.195
If only we had another Precog.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.899
One who gets names.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.876
MAN:
It didn't have to be this way.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.545
Don't try talking to me now.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.047
(distorted voices)

12:28.081 --> 12:30.083
(woman screams)

12:32.285 --> 12:35.823
Tell my brother
I'll be right there, Andromeda.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.901
Where is your new friend?

12:47.935 --> 12:49.536
Need help closing the deal?

12:49.569 --> 12:51.839
We're working on a new case.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.874
Case?

12:53.907 --> 12:56.476
So, are we both cops now?

12:56.509 --> 12:58.411
I know you got your pieces
of the puzzle, too.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.913
You always do.
If you're planning

12:59.947 --> 13:01.348
to stop every murder
in the city,

13:01.381 --> 13:02.850
you really should
consider costumes.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.118
A woman is about to die, Arthur.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.020
Some people deserve to.

13:07.054 --> 13:09.389
I don't have to tell you that.

13:11.892 --> 13:15.228
How did it feel...
killing someone?

13:19.867 --> 13:22.202
You get the names.
I need one.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.072
And you get
all the pretty pictures.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.907
Didn't you see a face?

13:26.940 --> 13:28.408
Not this time.

13:31.879 --> 13:34.514
Our only power that we have

13:34.547 --> 13:37.550
in this world
is what we see, Dash.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.286
We need to use it.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.389
Not throw it away on strangers.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.391
I'm trying to save lives.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.927
Yeah.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.628
I already did that.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.230
During the decade

13:50.263 --> 13:52.900
we spent in a milk bath.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.202
And what did we get for it?

13:56.436 --> 13:57.971
Twin beds on swamp island

13:58.005 --> 13:59.306
with no pension.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.909
I don't work for free anymore.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.977
It's always been about you.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.146
Oh.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.480
While you were running around,

14:07.514 --> 14:09.917
practically begging
to get yourself exposed,

14:09.950 --> 14:11.919
I've been looking out for us.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.955
Because when they come looking
for us again-- and they will--

14:14.988 --> 14:17.590
it won't be your good deeds
that save us.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.626
You know what will?

14:19.659 --> 14:21.929
Leverage.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.273
Is this supposed to be a name?

14:33.306 --> 14:34.607
It's a case file.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.576
Metro PD.
Your friend should have access.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.378
I need a copy.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.180
And she's not
to open it.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.415
Because I don't remember names
these days

14:42.449 --> 14:44.551
without my brother's help.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.519
You want Vega to break the law?

14:46.553 --> 14:48.088
What do you think
she's doing using you?

14:48.121 --> 14:50.557
I helped you
out last time.

14:50.590 --> 14:51.992
This is what I want in return.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.361
Go to hell.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.398
You'll be back, Dash.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.400
I don't have to see the
future to know that.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.044
Did he say what kind
of case it is?
I didn't ask.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.013
I never should
have gone to him.
I have eyes
on me already.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.714
If I go accessing old cases,
they're gonna notice.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.416
We need to do this
on our own.

15:16.449 --> 15:17.985
Good. We don't need Arthur.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.486
We know the victim
went to Club Alpha.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.154
We need to start there.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.023
Wait. No, you need
to settle down.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.357
Go back to Wally's.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.026
To do what?
Sit and wait?

15:26.059 --> 15:28.461
You're not a cop.
I'm coming with you.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.030
Yeah, because that worked out
so well last time.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.364
I'm sorry, Dash.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.066
You're not fit
to be in the field.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.434
I don't trust you
out there.
I saved your life.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.003
And I don't know how many times

15:36.003 --> 15:37.304
I can thank you for that.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.039
But you also killed
someone, Dash.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.241
You need to process that.

15:41.274 --> 15:45.478
I know. I will.

15:45.512 --> 15:48.048
I am.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.588
Look, if you need help,

15:55.622 --> 15:58.325
if you need to talk...
I need to do something.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.160
Go home, Dash.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.229
I'll be in touch.

16:02.262 --> 16:06.233
For a decade, all I did was
watch people being murdered.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.301
I can't do
that anymore.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.503
That is why I found you.

16:10.537 --> 16:13.206
So you could
help me stop them.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.408
(sighs)

16:15.442 --> 16:18.711
I'm done watching, Vega.

16:18.745 --> 16:21.481
Okay.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.684
I need to get you
a change of clothes.

16:28.421 --> 16:31.624
*

16:34.227 --> 16:36.563
(beep, chime)

16:40.133 --> 16:42.469
(beep, chime)

16:46.139 --> 16:48.075
Repeat it back to me
one more time.

16:48.075 --> 16:50.110
Any clues that look
familiar from my vision,

16:50.143 --> 16:51.444
I let you know first.

16:51.478 --> 16:52.779
That's right.
And no what?

16:52.812 --> 16:54.714
No going rogue.
I got it.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.249
Emergency use only.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.617
What is it?

16:57.650 --> 17:00.720
Sick Stick.
Police issue.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.290
Seriously? I need a weapon?

17:03.323 --> 17:05.625
Let's hope not, and make sure
that the business end

17:05.658 --> 17:07.794
is pointing
towards the other guy.
(click)

17:07.827 --> 17:10.097
And watch your feet.
Why?

17:10.097 --> 17:12.599
You're the Precog.

17:16.136 --> 17:19.106
Microbiome analyzer.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.541
Why waste time
on small talk

17:21.574 --> 17:24.311
when science can tell you
exactly what your chances are?

17:24.344 --> 17:26.646
(whirring)

17:26.679 --> 17:29.182
*

17:33.786 --> 17:36.489
My mom said hooking up in
the old days was better.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.158
People used to
actually text

17:38.191 --> 17:39.492
and swipe pictures.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.361
There was interaction.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.196
Romance is dead.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.698
(chime, beeps)

17:45.732 --> 17:47.200
Hmm. 51%.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.136
That's generous.

17:49.136 --> 17:51.438
Let's check this place out.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.248
You two need
a drink?

18:01.281 --> 18:03.283
Yes.
No.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.817
I'll have a bourbon, neat,

18:04.851 --> 18:07.287
and you can give him one
of those fru-fru drinks.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.688
No, I'll have a beer.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.890
Coming up.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.459
I thought we were on duty.

18:12.492 --> 18:13.826
First off, I'm on duty.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.628
You're my C.I.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.630
And second, if we want to learn
something, we have to blend in.

18:17.664 --> 18:20.233
* You shine like
silver in the sunlight *

18:20.267 --> 18:22.702
* You light up
my cold heart... *

18:22.735 --> 18:25.805
I'm not seeing Cinderella.

18:25.838 --> 18:29.542
Who?
You know, the owner
of the shoe. Silver

18:29.576 --> 18:30.643
slipper?

18:30.677 --> 18:33.813
Right. So, blending in is
not going to be your thing.

18:33.846 --> 18:37.550
I'm gonna go check
in the ladies' room.

18:37.584 --> 18:40.287
Tough one, huh?

18:40.320 --> 18:41.621
I got next round.

18:41.654 --> 18:46.326
What...? Oh, no... thank you.

18:46.359 --> 18:50.763
* A love like this
won't last forever *

18:50.797 --> 18:56.936
* I know that a love
like this won't last forever *

18:56.969 --> 18:58.871
* But I'm not gonna think
about the future *

18:58.905 --> 19:01.608
* A love like this

19:01.641 --> 19:05.212
* Won't last forever...

19:13.320 --> 19:14.587
Excuse me. Miss?

19:14.621 --> 19:17.524
Um... do you want something?

19:18.725 --> 19:20.893
I like your shoes.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.829
Get lost.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.702
(whirring)

19:29.736 --> 19:31.871
(man groans, woman screams)

19:31.904 --> 19:33.506
What the hell?!

19:33.540 --> 19:35.642
Wow.
Man, my shoes.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.845
(gasps) What are you doing?
Let go of me!
No, no! Listen.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.481
That guy was gonna
tie you up and kill you.

19:41.514 --> 19:45.552
You freak, he's my brother!

19:45.585 --> 19:48.688
Doctor? Can I get a... a doc?

19:48.721 --> 19:50.523
Hey.
I'm sorry.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.792
I thought I found...
The killer.

19:52.825 --> 19:56.329
Yes.
No! Look.

19:56.363 --> 19:59.366
It's the symbol
from your vision.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.970
Put that on my tab.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.751
(clears throat)
Here you go.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.453
Mm. Thanks.

20:20.487 --> 20:22.455
You sure you don't
want any, Dash?

20:22.489 --> 20:23.823
No, I'm good.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.525
How are you so awake?

20:25.558 --> 20:27.294
We staked out that guy
all night.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.028
I spent ten years
of my life asleep.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.464
But while you were sleeping,
we found out more

20:31.498 --> 20:33.900
on your potential murderer.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.535
His name is Tyson Cole.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.337
WALLY:
The moving tattoo
is an African

20:37.370 --> 20:38.771
Adinkra symbol
for harmony.

20:38.805 --> 20:41.574
The eternal bond
of man and woman.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.443
That's very in touch
for a murderer.

20:43.476 --> 20:46.012
Not to mention,
good publicity.
Publicity?

20:46.045 --> 20:47.880
He's famous?

20:47.914 --> 20:50.417
For a guy who
still writes books.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.788
Love by Your Rules.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.390
He's a pickup artist?

20:57.424 --> 20:58.891
Pick-up scientist, to be exact.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.693
He has a doctorate from Harvard.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.562
Not even
the online campus.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.897
Unlocking the Secret
of Seduction.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.567
Who even writes this stuff
with a straight face?

21:07.600 --> 21:11.003
I've been giving
it a quick skim.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.974
Research.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.944
What's our plan today?

21:17.977 --> 21:19.812
Same as last night.
We don't know for sure

21:19.846 --> 21:21.681
that Tyson is the murderer,
so we keep tabs.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.783
Wait till he finds his victim,
and then we move in.

21:23.816 --> 21:26.486
So, we use the victim as bait?

21:26.519 --> 21:27.720
Do you have a better idea,

21:27.754 --> 21:29.889
without evidence,
or police support?

21:29.922 --> 21:32.425
She's right. It's not
the good old fascist days

21:32.459 --> 21:33.793
of Precrime
when we could arrest a man

21:33.826 --> 21:35.428
for something that
he hadn't done yet.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.564
We have to catch them
in the act.

21:37.597 --> 21:38.965
So we just wait
for it to happen?

21:38.998 --> 21:40.600
And then we stop it.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.507
(birds singing)

21:47.540 --> 21:49.876
DASH:
How are the horses?

21:49.909 --> 21:51.944
John's as stubborn
as he always was.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.013
Mary foaled last week.

21:54.046 --> 21:55.715
Colt or filly?
Filly.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.717
I'm calling her
Samantha.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.887
(laughs)
She has blue eyes
and a white mane.

22:00.920 --> 22:04.391
Hmm.
Are we finished
with the small talk?

22:07.126 --> 22:09.429
You killed a man, Dash.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.731
Arthur tell you that?

22:11.764 --> 22:13.666
Do you expect me to believe
it isn't haunting you?

22:13.700 --> 22:16.035
He was a bad man.
Oh, well,
that changes everything.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.870
He was going to kill my partner.

22:17.904 --> 22:20.840
Your partner? Are you
listening to yourself?

22:20.873 --> 22:22.942
That detective is using you.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.544
To save lives.
And when it suits her

22:24.577 --> 22:26.413
to exploit your gift
for something else?

22:28.014 --> 22:30.783
There are worse things
in the world than murder, Dash.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.519
I'm not going over this again.

22:32.552 --> 22:33.720
And I have work to do.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.858
I wasn't making small talk.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.762
I miss home, Agatha.

22:42.795 --> 22:45.732
I miss you.

22:45.765 --> 22:48.701
But I need to be
here right now.

22:48.735 --> 22:51.538
I need to do this.

22:53.606 --> 22:54.941
You need to go.

22:54.974 --> 22:56.876
(phone ringing)

23:08.955 --> 23:10.990
(indistinct chatter)

23:17.630 --> 23:19.632
You're quiet tonight.

23:21.167 --> 23:22.735
Just reading.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.172
It was rough for me, too,

23:26.205 --> 23:28.908
the first time I
took someone down.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.679
Takes a while.

23:36.115 --> 23:39.686
Agatha thinks I'm putting
all of us at risk by doing this.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.621
That you're
just using me.

23:41.654 --> 23:45.157
Arthur thinks that you're
hot, but I'm an idiot.

23:45.191 --> 23:47.794
Naive.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.796
What do you think?

23:49.829 --> 23:51.898
Rule four.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.233
Rule four?

23:54.266 --> 23:57.136
There is no such thing
as a perfect partner.

23:57.169 --> 24:00.507
If it's trust you want,
look in the mirror.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.509
That's what Tyson thinks.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.544
I'm asking you.

24:05.712 --> 24:08.014
Jury's still out, I guess.

24:08.047 --> 24:10.049
Oh, here we go.

24:12.852 --> 24:16.723
VEGA:
The other guy is Tyson's
manager, Marcel Ahern.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.190
He owns a small percentage
of the club. That's why

24:18.224 --> 24:19.759
it's Tyson's fishing hole.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.128
Looks like Tyson's
not alone tonight.

24:22.161 --> 24:25.231
I can't tonight, but, uh, I
will see you soon, okay?

24:25.264 --> 24:26.599
Okay.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.067
VEGA:
He's letting her go.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.836
It's a total neg.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.839
You reject a woman to
attack her self-esteem

24:32.872 --> 24:34.541
and soon she'll
come after you.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.546
Yeah, you need
to trash that book.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.047
DASH:
He's leaving.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.749
VEGA:
Okay, let's go.

24:52.124 --> 24:54.761
System, show me thermal.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.201
He's alone in there.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.303
No potential victim.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.205
Maybe he's waiting
on a booty call.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.008
You know, like when...

25:09.041 --> 25:11.678
Yeah, I-I know what it is.

25:11.711 --> 25:14.681
We'll just have to wait.

25:14.714 --> 25:17.083
I'll take the first watch.
You get some rest.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.188
It didn't feel like anything.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.693
When I killed Rutledge.

25:26.726 --> 25:29.061
And it's not
that I'm not processing it,

25:29.095 --> 25:31.598
it's just...

25:31.631 --> 25:34.734
I've seen 700 murders, Vega.

25:34.767 --> 25:37.136
I've seen people stabbed,

25:37.169 --> 25:38.738
shot, choked,

25:38.771 --> 25:41.708
burned, poisoned.

25:41.741 --> 25:44.210
And I always assumed
that being there--

25:44.243 --> 25:47.146
actually killing someone--
would be...

25:47.179 --> 25:49.148
the worst feeling in the world.

25:49.181 --> 25:52.051
But what scares me
is that

25:52.084 --> 25:55.688
it didn't feel
like anything at all.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.724
Just numb.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.895
I've been there, Dash.

26:02.929 --> 26:04.697
Not like you, but...

26:04.731 --> 26:06.298
I've been there.

26:06.332 --> 26:09.702
And you just keep thinking
to yourself, "If I can just

26:09.736 --> 26:12.805
stop the next one, the
numbness'll go away."

26:14.907 --> 26:16.308
Will it?

26:18.277 --> 26:21.347
Well, I guess
we'll both find out.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.757
TYSON:
There was a time when

26:30.790 --> 26:33.960
all that mattered to the human
species was survival.

26:33.993 --> 26:37.096
Conquest.

26:37.129 --> 26:40.900
Sex.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.803
Wait, that's still
all that matters, isn't it?

26:43.836 --> 26:47.674
(audience laughs)

26:47.674 --> 26:49.909
You think that's true?
That's all people care about?

26:49.942 --> 26:52.011
Do you think I'd be
hanging out with you if it was?

26:52.044 --> 26:53.713
TYSON:
But, no,

26:53.746 --> 26:55.114
we want more,
too, don't we?

26:55.147 --> 26:56.683
We want meaning.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.217
Connection.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.252
We want to be saved.

27:00.286 --> 27:03.122
When I look into a woman's eyes,

27:03.155 --> 27:05.157
that's when I really see myself.

27:05.191 --> 27:08.394
My flaws,
my weaknesses.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.229
But when she says yes,

27:10.262 --> 27:13.232
they fade away.

27:13.265 --> 27:15.001
And that...

27:15.034 --> 27:17.837
is when I fall in love with me.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.810
What about
when she says no?

27:23.843 --> 27:25.211
Wait here.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.813
Where are you going?

27:26.846 --> 27:28.180
We spent two nights
waiting on Tyson

27:28.214 --> 27:29.816
to pick up
his murder victim.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.784
But we still don't
even know who she is.

27:31.818 --> 27:33.152
What if we don't need to?

27:33.185 --> 27:35.855
What if he picks up me, instead?

27:42.962 --> 27:44.797
The only question,
from me to you, is,

27:44.831 --> 27:46.365
was I too good?
Just stay here.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.034
That's the question.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.401
I don't think
that's possible.
I agree.

27:49.435 --> 27:52.104
I'm so sorry, I...
I got turned around.

27:52.138 --> 27:54.140
Yeah, the conference room
is just over there. If you'll

27:54.173 --> 27:56.308
excuse us, please, thank...
Right. Don't I know you?

27:56.342 --> 27:58.945
Tyler Call?
Cole.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.180
Tyson Cole.
Oh, right.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.883
And-and what are you, like, some
type of writer or something?

28:03.916 --> 28:05.351
Or something.
Tyson,

28:05.384 --> 28:06.886
we really should get going.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.120
It's-it's
all right, Marcel.

28:08.154 --> 28:10.356
Give us a minute.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.495
That was cute.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.064
A negative opener.

28:18.097 --> 28:20.900
Yeah, well, I learned
from the master.

28:20.933 --> 28:24.036
Well, looking at you, I wouldn't
think that you'd need much help.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.906
Well, maybe there's
more to me than meets the eye.

28:26.939 --> 28:30.877
That is very enticing, Ms....

28:30.910 --> 28:33.780
Bell. Lana Bell.

28:35.481 --> 28:38.017
And who sent you
to bait me, Ms. Bell?

28:38.050 --> 28:39.852
Hmm?
I'm sorry?

28:39.886 --> 28:41.854
What's the game this time?

28:41.888 --> 28:44.924
Honeypot me into bed so that you
can sell the VR streaming rights

28:44.957 --> 28:48.394
to live, first-person sex
with Tyson Cole?

28:48.427 --> 28:50.897
If you're recording this,

28:50.930 --> 28:54.200
my lawyers will destroy you.
Are we clear?

28:55.968 --> 28:58.204
Tyson, the car's ready.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.313
Rule eight.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.816
If you sense desperation,
walk away.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.919
Oh, I can't wait

29:12.952 --> 29:15.254
to bust him.
We still haven't
found his victim.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.457
(sighs)

29:18.490 --> 29:21.293
It's time to do your brother
that favor, after all.

29:33.139 --> 29:35.374
BLAKE:
Hey, Vega.

29:35.407 --> 29:36.976
There you are.

29:37.009 --> 29:39.111
Blake. I mean,
Lieutenant.

29:39.145 --> 29:42.281
Yes. I haven't seen you
in the precinct lately.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.283
Yeah, just been
cleaning up some case work.

29:44.316 --> 29:46.085
Well, we need to talk.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.520
Look, if this
is about the feds...
It's not.

29:48.554 --> 29:51.557
It's about something else.
Something big.

29:51.590 --> 29:54.060
A new program coming down
the pike from Central.

29:54.093 --> 29:56.062
Hawk-Eye.
Have you heard of it?

29:56.095 --> 29:58.965
Yeah, predictive policing
and-and computers as cops.

29:58.998 --> 30:01.467
Well, it's coming soon
to a precinct near you.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.003
Here?
The pilot program.

30:04.036 --> 30:06.873
Lara, I think
this could be huge for us.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.009
I want you with me on this.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.310
And you have no idea

30:11.343 --> 30:12.979
how much I want to hear more.

30:13.012 --> 30:15.281
How about I come see you
tomorrow in your office?

30:15.314 --> 30:18.284
Tomorrow? Vega.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.887
Mm, third floor.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.354
I need a favor.

30:22.388 --> 30:24.356
Hi, Akeela.
How are you, Akeela?

30:24.390 --> 30:27.159
Hi, how are you? I need you
to pull a file for me.

30:27.193 --> 30:29.461
An old case.

30:33.199 --> 30:34.934
Old? You're
not kidding.

30:34.967 --> 30:37.870
This case is from the
'30s. What's it about?

30:37.904 --> 30:39.571
Let me guess-- no
questions asked.

30:39.605 --> 30:41.007
We already discussed this.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.875
You're trying to
protect me, yes.

30:42.909 --> 30:45.611
But it's not me I'm
worried about, it's my...

30:45.644 --> 30:47.179
what's that word again?

30:47.213 --> 30:48.948
Friend.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.917
I know.

30:50.950 --> 30:53.119
So are you gonna
do this for me or not?

30:57.924 --> 31:00.659
I don't understand, Arthur.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.929
Why would you have me pull a
file you already know by heart?

31:02.929 --> 31:04.096
What makes you say that?

31:04.130 --> 31:06.132
Moira Arkadin.
Died at 24.

31:06.165 --> 31:08.134
Neuroin addict in the Sprawl.

31:08.167 --> 31:11.170
E.R. doctors said they
couldn't save her life, but

31:11.203 --> 31:13.339
they managed to save the lives
inside of her.

31:13.372 --> 31:17.209
Twin boys.
Sound familiar?

31:17.243 --> 31:19.078
Sad story.

31:19.111 --> 31:21.680
You told me
not to read the case file.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.115
And you ignored me.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.552
I respect that.
I don't trust a person

31:26.585 --> 31:29.221
who's not willing to bend
the rules. Especially a cop.

31:29.255 --> 31:32.291
So is that what this was?
A test?

31:32.324 --> 31:35.261
Since the day the doctors
cut us out of our mother's womb,

31:35.294 --> 31:37.296
I've looked out for my brother.

31:37.329 --> 31:40.299
Now, we have our share
of disagreements,

31:40.332 --> 31:42.969
but I'd never let
anybody hurt him.

31:42.969 --> 31:45.704
Is that a threat?

31:45.737 --> 31:49.308
I hope not. I'd really like
to get to know you better.

31:49.341 --> 31:52.344
If you're done,
it's your turn.

31:52.378 --> 31:54.113
I need the victim's name.

31:57.383 --> 31:59.618
You know what
I can already tell?

31:59.651 --> 32:02.421
We're gonna do
great things together.

32:20.306 --> 32:22.308
*

32:37.289 --> 32:38.257
MAN:
Hey, what's up?

32:38.290 --> 32:40.192
Hey!

32:40.226 --> 32:41.627
That's her.

32:44.463 --> 32:48.200
Blanca Garcia.
We have to warn her.

32:48.234 --> 32:51.237
And tell her what? That you see
her future-murder in a vision?

32:51.270 --> 32:53.739
Does it matter what we tell her
if we save her life?
Look, even

32:53.772 --> 32:55.207
if we do manage to
scare her off without

32:55.241 --> 32:56.608
completely outing
your identity,

32:56.642 --> 32:58.177
what happens next?

32:58.210 --> 33:00.112
Well, she lives, for one thing.

33:00.146 --> 33:03.315
And Tyson walks to kill again,
when we won't be there.

33:03.349 --> 33:05.551
The only way to take him off the
streets for good is to catch him

33:05.584 --> 33:07.186
red-handed.
With his victim.

33:07.219 --> 33:08.654
By using her as bait.

33:08.687 --> 33:11.257
And what if you mess up? Huh?

33:11.290 --> 33:14.326
What if you can't stop it?
I will.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.329
I didn't realize
you could see the future, too.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.799
Walk away, Dash.

33:20.832 --> 33:21.533
What?

33:21.567 --> 33:22.634
Walk away.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.236
Please.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.273
Blake.

33:27.306 --> 33:28.774
Hey, Vega.

33:28.807 --> 33:30.176
What are you doing here?
Noticed

33:30.209 --> 33:31.610
your A.R. was operational.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.079
Are you working tonight?

33:33.112 --> 33:35.081
I'm here
meeting a guy.

33:35.081 --> 33:37.183
Seriously? You tracked
my current location?

33:37.216 --> 33:38.684
I saw that you
pulled out an old case.

33:38.717 --> 33:41.387
A 30-year-old drug overdose?

33:41.420 --> 33:45.091
A favor for a cop friend of mine
in Boston.

33:45.091 --> 33:47.293
Thought it might be a murder.
The victim was his niece.

33:47.326 --> 33:49.161
You want in
on this?

33:49.195 --> 33:51.630
Hey, maybe you can become
their chief of police.

33:51.663 --> 33:55.334
I want you to quit being so
pissed off that I'm your boss.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.803
We spent four years as partners,
and ever since I got

33:57.836 --> 34:00.106
this office,
you act like I'm an enemy.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.143
Vega.

34:05.311 --> 34:07.146
Okay, well, let's hash this out.

34:07.179 --> 34:11.183
You're buying.
Yeah. What else
is new?

34:16.222 --> 34:18.790
Another long night, Blanca?

34:18.824 --> 34:22.394
Oh. Um...
Harlan.

34:22.428 --> 34:25.797
BLANCA:
Yeah. Might be time to call
it on account of lame.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.833
Yeah. I-I know
what you mean.
Oh.

34:27.866 --> 34:30.336
Sorry. That was
accidental contact.

34:30.369 --> 34:32.404
Yeah. No worries.

34:34.706 --> 34:36.508
Choppy night tonight.

34:36.542 --> 34:37.443
A whole lot
of fives

34:37.476 --> 34:38.544
and sixes.

34:38.577 --> 34:39.678
Excuse me?

34:39.711 --> 34:40.812
Like on a scale
of...

34:40.846 --> 34:42.781
I'm familiar
with the scale.

34:42.814 --> 34:45.717
I would say you're a seven,
though, at least.

34:45.751 --> 34:48.287
Are you negging me?

34:49.321 --> 34:51.390
So, you want to dance?

34:51.423 --> 34:52.658
Okay.

34:52.691 --> 34:54.160
BLAKE:
You think I don't know

34:54.160 --> 34:55.594
that you deserved
this job as much

34:55.627 --> 34:57.329
as I do?

34:57.363 --> 34:59.698
Or even more than I do?

34:59.731 --> 35:01.600
It's a
game, Lara,

35:01.633 --> 35:04.536
and I can help you learn
to play it.
You can?

35:04.570 --> 35:06.872
BLAKE:
Not if you keep avoiding me.
Avoiding you?

35:06.905 --> 35:09.541
I-I'm not avoiding you. Come on.

35:13.579 --> 35:14.780
What, is your guy here?

35:14.813 --> 35:16.248
Uh, I think so.

35:16.282 --> 35:18.217
But we've-we've never met
in person.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.352
Well, we can always try
to make him jealous.

35:20.386 --> 35:21.620
(chuckles)

35:21.653 --> 35:23.489
Is this guy bothering you,
Blanca?

35:23.522 --> 35:25.357
Can I close out, please?

35:25.391 --> 35:26.392
Wait, are you leaving?

35:26.425 --> 35:29.195
I thought
you weren't interested.

35:29.228 --> 35:31.330
What? Oh, no.
No, I'm glad.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.665
I want you to leave.
Immediately.

35:33.699 --> 35:36.402
The feeling's mutual.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.314
You know what, I think
I'm regretting this blind date.

35:48.347 --> 35:49.381
I'm gonna run.

35:49.415 --> 35:50.382
What?

35:50.416 --> 35:51.450
But thank you, Blake,

35:51.483 --> 35:53.219
for the great conversation.

35:53.219 --> 35:54.786
And you were right
about everything.

35:54.820 --> 35:57.956
Okay, see, this is exactly
what I'm talking about!

35:57.989 --> 35:59.691
What happened?
Where's she going?

35:59.725 --> 36:01.860
No, it's okay. I scared
her off. She just left.

36:01.893 --> 36:05.697
Yeah. And so did
Tyson Cole.

36:05.731 --> 36:07.766
(indistinct chatter)

36:14.606 --> 36:17.776
Sorry, it's my fault.
It's okay.
It's all right.

36:17.809 --> 36:20.646
It's been a crap night.
You can take this one.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.314
No, no. Let's share.

36:31.757 --> 36:34.260
Nice job.

36:34.293 --> 36:36.528
Now they have
a head start. Let's go.

36:36.562 --> 36:39.265
(tires screech)

36:39.298 --> 36:42.534
VEGA:
This time we do it my way.
Stay in the car.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.637
Tyson Cole!

36:45.671 --> 36:47.339
What? What is this?

36:47.373 --> 36:48.607
Metro PD.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.642
Hey, you're the
chick from the seminar.

36:50.676 --> 36:52.844
Where's Blanca Garcia?
Wait, who?

36:52.878 --> 36:54.446
The woman you picked up
at Club Alpha.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.447
Where is she?

36:55.481 --> 36:56.782
Oh, her? I don't know.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.784
She got out of the cab halfway,

36:58.817 --> 37:00.319
made up some excuse.

37:02.321 --> 37:05.023
What happened?
What went wrong?
We were too late.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.359
By the time we got to Tyson's,
Blanca was gone.
Gone?

37:07.393 --> 37:09.495
If she's the murder victim,
why would Tyson let her go?

37:09.528 --> 37:11.397
Because Tyson's not
the murderer. There's something

37:11.430 --> 37:13.832
in the vision
that we must have missed.
Hang on.

37:17.002 --> 37:19.505
That's Tyson's tattoo.
Okay, but it's also
the cover of his book.

37:19.538 --> 37:21.373
Maybe the murderer owns a copy?

37:21.407 --> 37:23.709
Along with a million
other people.

37:25.711 --> 37:28.447
(Blanca screams)

37:28.480 --> 37:29.881
Look.

37:31.383 --> 37:32.851
(Blanca screams)

37:35.654 --> 37:36.788
What, the blood?

37:36.822 --> 37:38.557
No, the reflection
in the blood.

37:42.361 --> 37:44.630
Chopsticks.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.632
The bartender at Club Alpha.

37:46.665 --> 37:49.568
He used those to mix his drinks.
You think
he's the killer?

37:49.601 --> 37:51.470
Blanca must have gone back
to the club.

37:54.340 --> 37:56.642
Hello?

37:58.744 --> 38:01.780
Anybody here?

38:04.416 --> 38:06.618
I-I was just locking up.

38:06.652 --> 38:07.953
(chuckles)

38:07.986 --> 38:09.855
Hi.
(chuckles)

38:09.888 --> 38:13.459
Um, sorry,
I think I might have...

38:13.492 --> 38:16.962
Forgot your purse?
(chuckles)

38:16.995 --> 38:19.965
Oh.

38:19.998 --> 38:23.535
I found it.
(chuckles)

38:23.569 --> 38:27.673
Blanca... right?

38:27.706 --> 38:31.377
Um...

38:40.118 --> 38:41.520
(grunts, panting)

38:41.553 --> 38:42.821
It didn't have
to be this way.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.122
You could have smiled back.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.691
Please.

38:45.724 --> 38:46.892
(screams)

38:46.925 --> 38:47.959
Night after night,

38:47.993 --> 38:49.495
week after week,

38:49.528 --> 38:51.397
I'm nice
to you.

38:51.430 --> 38:54.666
I'm right... for you.

38:54.700 --> 38:58.604
And you go home
with guys like him?

38:58.637 --> 39:00.806
No, but we-we never went home.

39:00.839 --> 39:04.476
I don't like guys like him.

39:04.510 --> 39:06.612
I like guys like you.

39:06.645 --> 39:09.648
Nice guys.

39:09.681 --> 39:13.652
Harold, right?

39:15.654 --> 39:17.656
Harlan.

39:19.658 --> 39:21.693
(shouts, panting)

39:21.727 --> 39:22.528
(grunting)

39:22.561 --> 39:23.128
(shouts)

39:30.068 --> 39:31.870
Don't try talking to me now.

39:37.208 --> 39:40.111
(whirring)

39:44.483 --> 39:46.585
(door opens)

39:46.618 --> 39:48.687
BLANCA:
Help!

39:48.720 --> 39:51.823
Help!
(grunts)

39:51.857 --> 39:54.125
Wait here.

40:10.709 --> 40:13.779
Blanca Garcia, you okay?

40:13.812 --> 40:17.783
(pants)
He's... still... here.

40:19.150 --> 40:20.151
Night vision.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.903
(whispering):
Don't shoot. It's just me.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.238
(whispering):
Get down. Where's Harlan?

40:40.271 --> 40:42.774
I don't know.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.652
Stay back.

41:07.699 --> 41:08.667
* I'm a sex cult
(shouts)

41:08.700 --> 41:11.537
* Like a wildfire

41:11.570 --> 41:15.273
* Yeah, yeah, yeah

41:15.306 --> 41:16.274
* I'm an animal...

41:16.307 --> 41:17.776
Ugh, I can't see.

41:18.944 --> 41:20.779
The light blasted
my night vision.

41:20.812 --> 41:23.081
You don't have to.

41:28.119 --> 41:30.789
Stand and fire over your
left shoulder in four seconds.

41:30.822 --> 41:33.559
What? Dash. What am I
shooting at?
One one thousand.
Two one thousand.

41:33.559 --> 41:35.193
Dash!
Three one thousand. Now!

41:39.698 --> 41:43.602
Where was he? I didn't see him.
Dash, I missed.

41:43.635 --> 41:45.036
I didn't.

41:52.811 --> 41:55.046
You knew
where he'd be.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.583
From now on, maybe
you shouldn't stay in the car.

41:59.084 --> 42:01.119
Way to go.
Vega.

42:02.721 --> 42:04.055
Thanks.

42:09.094 --> 42:11.062
Harlan Elbert,

42:11.096 --> 42:14.065
you have the right
to remain silent.

42:20.305 --> 42:23.642
WOMAN:
Hey.

42:23.675 --> 42:25.877
You still want to play?

42:54.940 --> 42:56.842
WOMAN:
All right. Let's put them in.
