00:38.371 --> 00:39.565
This is it.

00:39.606 --> 00:41.164
I'm standing on the very spot

00:41.207 --> 00:44.370
where many Christians believe
the world will come to an end.

00:44.411 --> 00:46.174
It's called Megiddo.

00:46.212 --> 00:48.646
And it's the place that
the Book of Revelation says

00:48.681 --> 00:50.808
Jesus Christ
will come down to

00:50.850 --> 00:53.978
to end the world and save
the people who believe in him.

00:54.020 --> 00:56.511
Now when Revelations
was written,

00:56.556 --> 00:59.491
only God had the capacity
to end the world,

00:59.526 --> 01:02.723
but now man does too,
because unfortunately,

01:02.762 --> 01:05.093
before man figured out
how to be rational

01:05.131 --> 01:08.032
or peaceful, he figured out
nuclear weapons

01:08.068 --> 01:10.628
and how to pollute
on a catastrophic scale.

01:10.670 --> 01:12.797
And if it's one thing
I hate more than prophecy,

01:12.839 --> 01:15.330
it's self-fulfilling prophecy.

01:18.445 --> 01:21.243
Sometimes in your search
for happiness,

01:21.281 --> 01:23.772
you ponder the meaning
of your life.

01:23.817 --> 01:26.445
Who am I?
How did I come to be?

01:26.486 --> 01:29.353
Death, and then what?

01:30.990 --> 01:33.652
I certainly honestly believe

01:33.693 --> 01:35.957
religion is detrimental

01:35.995 --> 01:37.963
to the progress
of humanity.

01:37.997 --> 01:40.465
You know, it's just selling
an invisible product.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.559
It's too easy.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.628
These questions
about what happens when you die,

01:45.672 --> 01:49.233
they so freak people out

01:49.275 --> 01:51.937
that they will
just make up any story

01:51.978 --> 01:53.741
and cling to it.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.907
You know, things that they know

01:55.949 --> 01:58.747
can't be true,
people who are otherwise

01:58.785 --> 02:01.185
so rational about everything else,

02:01.221 --> 02:03.018
and then they believe that

02:03.056 --> 02:05.650
on Sunday
they're drinking the blood

02:05.692 --> 02:07.887
of a 2,000-year-old God.

02:07.927 --> 02:11.363
I can't...
that's a dissonance in my head.

02:11.397 --> 02:13.922
I can't... I have to find out.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.367
I just have to find out.
I have to try.

02:41.394 --> 02:44.727
This is the Mount of Olives.
This is Jesus's footprints.

02:44.764 --> 02:46.527
We're here freezing our ass off.

02:52.705 --> 02:55.003
Is there anybody on the stage that

02:55.041 --> 02:57.509
- does not believe in evolution?
- Yeah.

03:00.446 --> 03:02.880
Hurry hurry hurry.

03:06.052 --> 03:07.849
- I like my hat.
- You look good too.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.149
Welcome to Bible Country!

03:11.191 --> 03:13.182
"Birthplace of the Virgin Mary"?

03:16.062 --> 03:18.826
I believe that God wants
everybody to be free.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.833
That's what I believe,

03:20.867 --> 03:24.530
and that's one part
of my foreign policy.

03:26.773 --> 03:28.764
Bill, watch out.

03:32.278 --> 03:34.610
Boy, do I feel cheap.

03:39.919 --> 03:42.080
I want to thank God
for just blessing me so much.

03:42.121 --> 03:44.055
Music has been
a blessing from God.

03:44.090 --> 03:46.115
Thank you, Jesus!

03:46.159 --> 03:50.027
You need a Holy Ghost enema
right up your rear end!

04:00.173 --> 04:02.437
The archives are there on the fifth
floor where you see the curtains.

04:02.475 --> 04:04.670
Yeah, put that away now.
Put that away.

04:07.213 --> 04:09.408
If you look at my stand-up

04:09.449 --> 04:12.043
from like the '80s... that era...

04:12.085 --> 04:15.145
early '90s,

04:15.188 --> 04:18.988
I talked about religion,
but I'm not ever questioning God.

04:19.024 --> 04:21.425
I'm just making fun
about things

04:21.461 --> 04:23.588
in the religion...
circumcision.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.393
Circumcision...
I mean, I would've loved

04:25.431 --> 04:28.832
to have been there for
the first people to hear about this.

04:28.868 --> 04:31.336
We're used to it now,
but you know, I mean,

04:31.371 --> 04:33.236
I'm sure when Moses came
down with this idea,

04:33.273 --> 04:35.673
there had to be one guy going,

04:35.708 --> 04:37.903
"Let me get this straight."

04:37.944 --> 04:40.276
It was just
a gentle poking fun at Him.

04:40.313 --> 04:42.247
It's almost like
I'm roasting Him.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.944
My mother is Jewish and my father
is Catholic. That is the truth.

04:44.984 --> 04:46.747
I was raised Catholic formally,

04:46.786 --> 04:49.084
although I must say
the Jewish mind comes out

04:49.122 --> 04:51.352
even in the Catholic system.
I'll give you an example.

04:51.391 --> 04:53.154
We used to go into confession

04:53.192 --> 04:55.786
and I would bring
a lawyer in with me.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.598
You know.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.227
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

05:04.270 --> 05:06.431
I think you know Mr. Cohen.

05:10.209 --> 05:13.144
So let me get out some pictures.

05:13.179 --> 05:15.010
There's me.

05:15.048 --> 05:17.278
We weren't brought up Jewish.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.445
I didn't even know
we had that side,

05:20.486 --> 05:22.511
so it was very Catholic.

05:22.555 --> 05:24.716
We went to church
every Sunday,

05:24.757 --> 05:27.021
but I wouldn't take off the gun

05:27.060 --> 05:28.789
and really when I think back,

05:28.828 --> 05:31.160
it wasn't relevant
to my life.

05:31.197 --> 05:34.826
Superman was relevant
and baseball.

05:34.867 --> 05:37.427
We had this family

05:37.470 --> 05:39.768
where one person
was Jewish

05:39.806 --> 05:42.900
and the other three
were Catholic.

05:42.942 --> 05:45.911
Now there it says
"A Sunday noon, fall '66,"

05:45.945 --> 05:49.540
so we must've
just gotten back from church,

05:49.582 --> 05:51.675
'cause I'm in a red suit

05:51.718 --> 05:54.653
and you're choking the dog.

05:54.687 --> 05:58.384
And I guess we got home from church
and took a picture with you.

05:58.424 --> 06:00.415
It never occurred to me to say,

06:00.460 --> 06:01.654
"Why didn't you go to church?"

06:01.694 --> 06:03.025
Mom...

06:03.062 --> 06:05.690
what church do we belong to?

06:05.732 --> 06:07.825
I don't remember
this ever coming up.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.835
Of course you didn't go
to church with us.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.497
No, we never had a family
discussion about it, never.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.438
We never had
a family discussion about that.

06:14.474 --> 06:17.932
Every family is dysfunctional.

06:17.977 --> 06:21.276
So you thought even this,
which wasn't your religion,

06:21.314 --> 06:23.544
was better than no religion.

06:23.583 --> 06:26.950
Well, even this only
told you good things...

06:26.986 --> 06:28.578
I thought.

06:28.621 --> 06:31.784
But it's just so shamelessly
invented as they go along.

06:31.824 --> 06:35.419
- We can say that now.
- Was anyone...

06:35.461 --> 06:37.827
When we quit
the church, I was 13,

06:37.864 --> 06:41.265
and I was of course thrilled,
but not for any ideological reason.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.268
I was just thrilled
'cause I hated church.

06:43.302 --> 06:45.133
It scared me.
It was boring.

06:45.171 --> 06:47.036
I had to get up
on Sunday.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.665
I was 13.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.040
I would've worshiped anything
that could've allowed me

06:51.077 --> 06:53.910
to masturbate even more
than I was masturbating

06:53.946 --> 06:57.746
or get a girl. That god I would have
definitely worshipped.

06:57.784 --> 06:59.775
Why do you remember

06:59.819 --> 07:02.652
Dad stopped going to church?

07:02.688 --> 07:05.156
We used birth control,

07:05.191 --> 07:08.422
and the church frowned
on birth control.

07:08.461 --> 07:10.429
That was the biggest sin

07:10.463 --> 07:13.762
- you could ever commit.
- Right, that would...

07:13.800 --> 07:17.395
I think that was possibly...
he never said it to me.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.565
And he never went back.
None of us ever did.

07:20.606 --> 07:23.097
So now that we don't believe,

07:23.142 --> 07:24.769
where did...

07:24.811 --> 07:26.642
Nobody said we don't believe.

07:26.679 --> 07:28.476
We don't believe in Catholicism.

07:30.917 --> 07:34.114
Right, but what do
we believe in now?

07:34.153 --> 07:36.553
Come on.
You're my mother, instruct me.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.948
I don't know
the answer to that.

07:39.992 --> 07:41.425
That's my answer.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.692
We'll take some back roads to see

07:44.730 --> 07:46.960
- some interesting stuff out here.
- Take some back roads.

07:46.999 --> 07:49.331
We are heading toward Raleigh, right?

07:49.368 --> 07:51.802
Oh, yeah, man, can't you feel it?

08:14.160 --> 08:16.526
Do I stand up here?
So as I was going here,

08:16.562 --> 08:19.292
I just jotted down
a few questions that came to my mind.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.267
Are you ever bothered
by many things

08:22.301 --> 08:25.031
that are in Christianity
that are not in the Bible?

08:25.071 --> 08:27.733
Like original sin.

08:27.773 --> 08:29.502
Immaculate conception.

08:29.542 --> 08:33.477
The virgin birth is only
in two of the Gospels... popes.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.539
Are you worried that these things
came not from the founders,

08:36.582 --> 08:38.880
the people that wrote
this book, but from...

08:38.918 --> 08:41.044
and this is indisputable...
but from men,

08:41.087 --> 08:43.020
from human beings
who came after?

08:43.054 --> 08:45.580
And when I say men,
I mean people with penises.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.421
If you wanna go back
to scientific proof,

08:49.462 --> 08:51.453
I think it was determined
the shroud or whatever that was

08:51.497 --> 08:53.021
went around a while back...
I didn't get involved.

08:53.065 --> 08:56.034
- Shroud of Turin?
- They took blood samples from it,

08:56.068 --> 08:58.093
and it was female blood
with a male figure.

08:58.137 --> 09:00.605
Okay, the only possible way
that could happen was

09:00.640 --> 09:03.700
that the Holy Ghost
impregnated Mary

09:03.743 --> 09:05.711
because it would've
been female blood

09:05.745 --> 09:07.736
because it would've been
the only blood flowing through her.

09:10.249 --> 09:12.308
- It's a faith thing.
- But why is faith good?

09:12.351 --> 09:14.842
Why is believing something
without evidence good?

09:14.887 --> 09:16.616
I don't like the way
this thing's going.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.624
I don't know what
this documentary's supposed to be,

09:18.658 --> 09:20.250
but I don't like
where you're going.

09:20.293 --> 09:23.524
You start disputing my God,

09:23.563 --> 09:26.862
and you got a problem.
I don't know what you...

09:26.899 --> 09:30.198
I'm outta here. You do what
you wanna do, but I'm outta here.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.563
- I'm just asking questions.
- Okay, no problem.

09:35.608 --> 09:38.475
When I've seen what I've seen,
I know there's a God.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.412
You can't change my mind.
Nobody can change my mind.

09:41.447 --> 09:44.473
I walked for 30 years
as a Satanist priest.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.644
From the time I grew up,
I was in Satanism.

09:46.686 --> 09:49.154
For the last six years,
that I was into Satanism,

09:49.188 --> 09:51.281
I was a Satanist priest, okay?

09:51.324 --> 09:53.417
- Real Satanism?
- Yes, real Satanism.

09:53.459 --> 09:56.428
Being addicted to drugs,
and running prostitutes

09:56.462 --> 09:58.487
and the women
and everything that goes with that.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.897
I walked around with rolls
of money in my pocket.

10:00.933 --> 10:03.231
I gave all that up
when I got saved.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.294
When the guy said,
"Yeah, I used to do drugs.

10:05.338 --> 10:08.796
I used to have women,"
and I'm thinking,

10:08.841 --> 10:12.140
- "And your problem was?"
- Right.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.475
Let me ask you this question:

10:13.512 --> 10:14.809
What if we're right
and you're wrong?

10:14.847 --> 10:17.145
We gonna make it
and you ain't.

10:17.183 --> 10:19.174
If you're being good
just to save your ass

10:19.218 --> 10:21.516
just because,
"Ooh, they might be right

10:21.554 --> 10:24.182
and I just want
to double down here

10:24.223 --> 10:26.521
and make sure that
when I get up to the pearly gates,

10:26.559 --> 10:28.550
that St. Peter doesn't say to me,

10:28.594 --> 10:30.528
'Sorry, asshole,
you had the wrong religion.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.622
Enjoy Hell, buh-bye." '

10:32.665 --> 10:34.633
That's not a good reason,
and you know that.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.828
Come on, believe in Jesus.
What do you have to lose?

10:36.869 --> 10:38.860
It's like the lotto.

10:38.904 --> 10:41.372
You can't get saved
if you don't play.

10:41.407 --> 10:44.103
Yeah, you could be right.
I don't think it's very likely,

10:44.143 --> 10:47.442
but, yes, you could be right,
because my big thing is I don't know.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.674
That's what I preach.

10:48.714 --> 10:51.706
I preach the gospel
of I don't know!

10:51.751 --> 10:54.185
I mean that's what
I'm here promoting... doubt.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.585
- That's my product.
- Right.

10:55.621 --> 10:58.556
The other guys are
selling certainty, not me.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.525
I'm on the corner
with doubt.

11:00.559 --> 11:02.117
So, Dr. Collins,

11:02.161 --> 11:04.595
you are a brilliant
brilliant scientist,

11:04.630 --> 11:07.190
the head
of the Human Genome Project.

11:07.233 --> 11:10.430
Now here's what's
so puzzling is that you are

11:10.469 --> 11:12.198
the one scientist...

11:12.238 --> 11:13.967
the one famous scientist anyway...

11:14.006 --> 11:16.804
who's also religious.
Explain that to me.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.003
I would argue that
if you look at the evidence,

11:19.045 --> 11:22.811
the historical evidence
of Christ's existence is overwhelming.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.679
What evidence?

11:24.717 --> 11:28.209
I mean, I've never even heard
anyone propose that there's evidence.

11:28.254 --> 11:29.983
There's been proof
that there's a Jesus.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.320
- That's been proven.
- That hasn't been proven.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.156
How you figure that one?

11:35.194 --> 11:36.661
When I read the New Testament,

11:36.696 --> 11:39.563
it reads to me
as the record of eyewitnesses

11:39.598 --> 11:40.929
who put down what they saw.

11:40.966 --> 11:43.025
You know
they weren't eyewitnesses.

11:43.069 --> 11:45.094
- They were close to that.
- No.

11:45.137 --> 11:47.867
Within a couple
of decades of eyewitnesses.

11:47.907 --> 11:50.842
- Okay.
- Would that stand up in a laboratory

11:50.876 --> 11:54.141
as absolute foolproof evidence

11:54.180 --> 11:55.738
that something happened?

11:55.781 --> 11:58.215
You are setting up
a standard for proof

11:58.250 --> 12:01.549
that I think would really be
an almost impossible standard to meet.

12:01.587 --> 12:05.114
No gospel tells us what he was
doing when he was a young man.

12:05.157 --> 12:07.352
You know,
we see Jesus as an infant

12:07.393 --> 12:10.954
and then we kind of pick up
the story when he's 30.

12:10.996 --> 12:13.294
I think Jesus was probably
an awkward teenager...

12:13.332 --> 12:16.563
big Jewfro,
bad at sports.

12:16.602 --> 12:18.968
Here I am!

12:19.004 --> 12:21.598
The records we have
are all gospels.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.767
Gospels are not history.

12:23.809 --> 12:26.937
Gospel writers never met Jesus,
neither did St. Paul.

12:26.979 --> 12:28.970
No one who wrote
about Jesus ever met him.

12:29.014 --> 12:30.982
How can you go back
into the prophets

12:31.016 --> 12:33.143
and the prophets specifically
specifies that certain things...

12:33.185 --> 12:34.709
Well, first of all,

12:34.754 --> 12:37.279
the New Testament came after
the Old Testament. We agree to that?

12:37.323 --> 12:39.553
I agree to that,
but that doesn't mean anything.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.787
All it means is the people that
wrote the New Testament

12:41.827 --> 12:45.228
read the Old Testament
and then made the prophesies fit.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.822
They can't make it fit
if something didn't happen.

12:46.866 --> 12:48.493
Of course they can.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.729
Then you're saying
the Bible is fictitious?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.397
- I am.
- Can't be.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.962
I am.

12:54.006 --> 12:56.167
We do all know that
those texts don't match.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.233
Yeah, sure.
Would you expect them to?

12:58.277 --> 13:01.337
I'm surprised that things
that are very important to the story

13:01.380 --> 13:03.974
like the virgin birth
isn't in all four of them.

13:04.016 --> 13:07.383
Wouldn't you really expect
that kind of discordance when you're

13:07.419 --> 13:10.183
thinking about the way in which
these documents came into being?

13:10.222 --> 13:13.316
But you'd think if you were
one of Christ's biographers,

13:13.359 --> 13:16.988
that would be sort
of an important thing not to leave out.

13:17.029 --> 13:20.157
Oh, God,
he was also born of a virgin.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.429
They don't notice the virgin birth.

13:22.468 --> 13:26.427
You know, I think that is something
if you were any sort of reporter

13:26.472 --> 13:28.337
you'd put into the story.

13:28.374 --> 13:32.140
What editor looks at the facts and goes,
"Yeah, but take out the thing

13:32.178 --> 13:35.875
about the virgin birth.
That's not interesting."

13:35.915 --> 13:38.042
I think being without faith

13:38.083 --> 13:40.278
is something that's a luxury

13:40.319 --> 13:42.412
for people who were
fortunate enough

13:42.454 --> 13:44.285
to have a fortunate life.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.881
You know, you go to prison

13:45.925 --> 13:48.155
and you hear a guy say,
"You know what, buddy?

13:48.194 --> 13:49.786
I got nothing but Jesus in here."

13:49.829 --> 13:52.127
I completely understand that.

13:52.164 --> 13:55.395
I think not having faith
is a luxury sometimes.

13:55.434 --> 13:58.335
If you're in a foxhole,
you probably have a lot of faith, right?

13:58.370 --> 14:00.133
- Mm-hmm.
- So I get that.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.902
But you guys aren't dumb.
You're smart people.

14:02.942 --> 14:04.466
How can smart people...

14:04.510 --> 14:06.978
how can they believe
in the talking snake,

14:07.012 --> 14:09.708
people living to 900 years old
and the virgin birth?

14:09.748 --> 14:11.875
And you know,
that's my question.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.475
You guys have
your own questions.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.043
Pray for me.

14:15.087 --> 14:17.817
Father, in the name of Jesus
and by the power of the Holy Spirit,

14:17.857 --> 14:20.052
we ask right now, Lord,
as we lift up Bill to You, Father,

14:20.092 --> 14:22.925
that You can answer his questions
that we can't answer.

14:22.962 --> 14:24.930
Father, we thank You
right now for the opportunity

14:24.964 --> 14:27.091
that has come today,

14:27.132 --> 14:29.760
that we may voice
our opinions and hear others.

14:29.802 --> 14:31.463
So we ask You, Lord, to touch

14:31.503 --> 14:34.472
and feel wisdom right now
in the name of Jesus.

14:34.506 --> 14:36.565
And we thank You for it
in Jesus's name, amen.

14:36.609 --> 14:39.772
Thank you for being Christlike,
and not just Christian.

14:39.812 --> 14:43.213
Okay. Hey, my wallet!

14:43.249 --> 14:46.013
No, I'm kidding.

14:46.051 --> 14:49.851
You see so many nice people
trying to make it about

14:49.889 --> 14:51.618
something good

14:51.657 --> 14:54.182
and yet it turns
into not just corrupt,

14:54.226 --> 14:57.423
but, like, fucking-little-kids corrupt

14:57.463 --> 14:59.829
and burning-people-alive cor...

14:59.865 --> 15:02.390
I mean, really evil shit.

15:02.434 --> 15:05.232
I'd like to see 10,000 people

15:05.271 --> 15:06.761
give $10,000.

15:06.805 --> 15:09.273
Write your biggest check
and send it in.

15:09.308 --> 15:12.106
We got people on welfare that's got
enough faith to make a $1,000 vow

15:12.144 --> 15:16.103
- and paying it!
- I want to be in the green, Lord!

15:17.950 --> 15:21.442
What I'm about
to say is revelation.

15:21.487 --> 15:23.614
I got it on DVD.
And I have it on DVD.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.022
And you need to get this. Hallelujah!

15:28.928 --> 15:31.192
Hallelujah!

15:35.334 --> 15:37.234
Reverend.
Is that what I call you?

15:37.269 --> 15:39.635
No, just call me... doctor.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.765
- Doctor?
- Yeah.

15:41.807 --> 15:45.299
All right, Doc. First of all,
I have to tell you, when I heard that

15:45.344 --> 15:47.505
you were in Harold Melvin
and the Blue Notes,

15:47.546 --> 15:49.741
I was like, "That's my man."

15:53.852 --> 15:56.184
And it's funny,
because that lyric

15:56.221 --> 15:58.246
can be interpreted religiously.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.258
"If you don't know me
by now." Right?

16:00.292 --> 16:02.021
I mean, you must've thought of that.

16:02.061 --> 16:04.359
The song did go platinum.

16:06.198 --> 16:08.166
Teddy Pendergrass,
who led the song,

16:08.200 --> 16:10.691
he was ordained a minister
when he was 10 years old.

16:10.736 --> 16:13.102
What do you think
it says about religion

16:13.138 --> 16:15.072
and how serious it is

16:15.107 --> 16:17.268
if you can be a minister
when you're 10?

16:20.479 --> 16:24.040
But there is a comparison
to be made between

16:24.083 --> 16:26.278
musical stars, rock stars

16:26.318 --> 16:28.650
and religious figures.
They very often both dress

16:28.687 --> 16:30.951
- in elaborate costumes...
- Mm-hmm.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.821
...that get people's attention.

16:46.605 --> 16:48.163
People in a congregation

16:48.207 --> 16:50.539
must know that
the outfit was financed

16:50.576 --> 16:53.545
by their donations,
and it doesn't seem to bother them.

16:53.579 --> 16:55.638
I always dress well.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.876
I see! Are those gators?

16:57.916 --> 16:59.508
Those are lizards.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.212
- Lizards?
- Yes.

17:01.253 --> 17:04.518
- What do they run?
- They don't run. They crawl.

17:06.458 --> 17:08.517
And I see you got a lot of bling.

17:08.560 --> 17:12.359
I like gold.
The people want you to look well.

17:12.397 --> 17:14.366
That's what pimps say
about their women.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.733
I was told by one of the greatest pimps
that ever lived...

17:17.770 --> 17:21.069
his name is called God...

17:21.106 --> 17:22.232
that if you know what you got,

17:22.273 --> 17:24.242
then you ain't got much.

17:24.276 --> 17:26.175
Jesus dressed very well.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.270
Oh, come on.

17:28.313 --> 17:30.611
- Where is the Biblical evidence?
- Wait a minute.

17:30.649 --> 17:32.844
When he was born,
they brought him gold.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.353
They brought him gold.
He was not poor.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.821
So my image of Jesus as a man

17:37.856 --> 17:39.881
who championed the poor
and walked around

17:39.925 --> 17:43.361
in simple garb, that's wrong?

17:43.395 --> 17:45.522
It was linen.
It was fine linen.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.088
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:47.132 --> 17:50.624
But Jesus constantly preaches
against rich people.

17:50.669 --> 17:53.069
The Bible does not speak
against being rich.

17:53.105 --> 17:55.801
- Jesus does. Very plainly.
- No no.

17:55.841 --> 17:58.969
Jesus was very
very against the rich.

17:59.011 --> 18:02.276
He never preached against being poor.
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for...

18:02.314 --> 18:04.111
No, he preached
against being rich.

18:04.149 --> 18:06.777
No no no, he said that
it's better for a rich man...

18:06.819 --> 18:10.277
than a rich man to enter...

18:10.322 --> 18:14.088
It is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle

18:14.126 --> 18:16.594
than for a rich man
to enter the Kingdom.

18:16.628 --> 18:20.257
Okay, but now things
like houses and cars

18:20.299 --> 18:22.790
and clothes and money,

18:22.835 --> 18:25.133
they come as a result

18:25.170 --> 18:27.331
of my seeking God first.

18:27.372 --> 18:29.340
I don't remember that

18:29.374 --> 18:30.966
in the New Testament specifically.

18:31.009 --> 18:33.034
But it's there. I remember it.

18:33.078 --> 18:34.602
The houses, the cars

18:34.646 --> 18:35.635
and the clothes, they'll come.

18:35.681 --> 18:38.980
Yeah, money comes,
money happens, you know.

18:39.017 --> 18:42.509
Well, money happens for you
because they're giving it up to you.

18:42.554 --> 18:44.818
You're not giving it up to them.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.119
Let me set the record straight.

18:46.158 --> 18:48.319
I do not receive
a salary from the church.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.521
I do not take a salary
from the church.

18:50.562 --> 18:52.189
- You take it right out of the pot.
- No no no.

18:52.231 --> 18:53.994
It's such a powerful position.

18:54.032 --> 18:56.262
I mean, you hold people's

18:56.301 --> 18:59.862
greatest hopes and dreams
in the palm of your hand, really.

18:59.905 --> 19:02.738
Certainly, some of the young women
must get a crush on you.

19:05.777 --> 19:08.803
Probably. I would too
if I was out there.

19:08.847 --> 19:11.577
If I was a woman, I'd probably
have a crush on me, too.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.642
That's keepin' it real.

19:13.685 --> 19:17.382
Now I can advise other young men
about women, because I've been there.

19:17.422 --> 19:20.118
I had a young man who was
about to go crazy over a woman.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.820
He was about
to kill himself, you know?

19:21.860 --> 19:24.988
I said, " That kind of passion,
you should have for God."

19:25.030 --> 19:27.931
I said, " Turn that to God
and see what happens."

19:31.036 --> 19:34.995
St. Paul, for example,
whom I know you compare yourself to.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.065
People do.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.907
But he famously
only wore on his back

19:39.945 --> 19:42.345
the clothes that he owned.

19:42.381 --> 19:44.008
- Should I assume that this is...
- He was always on the run.

19:44.049 --> 19:47.712
This is your only $2,000 suit?

19:47.753 --> 19:49.812
The gentleman who made
this suit for me

19:49.855 --> 19:51.914
owns a clothing store.

19:51.957 --> 19:54.187
Mr. Kane, you in the house?

19:54.226 --> 19:56.990
The prices that I get
my clothes for...

19:57.029 --> 19:59.827
- you know, I'm blessed in that area.
- Yes, you are.

19:59.865 --> 20:03.596
I'm more blessed than
I've ever been all the days of my life.

20:03.635 --> 20:06.866
And the owner is a Muslim,
which... I came out of Islam.

20:06.905 --> 20:10.636
I know, I think it's very interesting
that you're a Christian now,

20:10.676 --> 20:13.144
you were a Muslim
and when you get your clothes,

20:13.178 --> 20:16.875
you buy them like a Jew.

20:16.915 --> 20:19.406
And action!

20:19.451 --> 20:22.318
That's right... behind me and above me
is the original Twin Cities,

20:22.354 --> 20:23.514
Sodom and Gomorrah.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.819
Apparently, it was
a pretty wicked place.

20:25.857 --> 20:27.552
How wicked?

20:27.593 --> 20:30.061
Well let's just say that
what happened in Gomorrah,

20:30.095 --> 20:31.722
stayed in Gomorrah.

20:36.134 --> 20:37.624
That is until God got wind of it,

20:37.669 --> 20:40.297
so he sent two angels
to investigate.

20:40.339 --> 20:42.307
Now the angels went to the house

20:42.341 --> 20:45.071
of the one godly man in town... Lot.

20:45.110 --> 20:48.807
And the townspeople tried
to rape them.

20:48.847 --> 20:51.008
Now Lot,

20:51.049 --> 20:53.916
not wanting his town
to get the reputation

20:53.952 --> 20:57.581
as the kind of place
that would rape angels,

20:57.623 --> 21:01.252
offered up to the mob
his own daughters to rape.

21:01.293 --> 21:03.818
And he was
the good guy in town.

21:03.862 --> 21:05.921
Which brings me
to this question:

21:05.964 --> 21:09.229
If I ever had to swear an oath,

21:09.268 --> 21:11.236
why would I want to put my hand

21:11.270 --> 21:14.296
on the King James Bible?

21:14.339 --> 21:17.502
I think I could find more morality
in the Rick James Bible.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.974
God hates fags.

21:23.015 --> 21:26.678
The Constitution does not
grant to homosexuals

21:26.718 --> 21:28.413
the right to perform sodomy.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.614
- I'm a monk.
- A monk.

21:30.656 --> 21:32.317
Franciscan.

21:32.357 --> 21:34.325
What do you think
of homosexuality?

21:34.359 --> 21:36.691
Do you think that's...
the Bible is against it.

21:36.728 --> 21:38.320
No, the Bible is not against it.

21:38.363 --> 21:40.331
The Bible's not
against homosexuality?

21:40.365 --> 21:43.391
If you are born homosexual,
you are to stay there.

21:43.435 --> 21:46.029
- You have to be happy.
- But that's what the Bible says?

21:46.071 --> 21:48.699
What the Bible means to say, yeah.

21:48.740 --> 21:50.605
Oh, what the Bible means to say!

21:50.642 --> 21:52.701
Now that's a good book.

21:52.744 --> 21:54.837
It preaches the rock-solid truth.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.370
You are faggots!

21:56.415 --> 21:59.782
I don't hate them.
God hates them.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.651
- Hey, Bill.
- How are you? Nice to meet you.

22:02.688 --> 22:05.555
Okay. Okay.

22:05.590 --> 22:09.026
So of course, the reason
why we're here is because you're...

22:09.061 --> 22:11.529
I guess we would say, ex-gay.

22:11.563 --> 22:13.497
You used to be gay

22:13.532 --> 22:16.330
and then you married someone
who used to be a lesbian.

22:16.368 --> 22:19.428
And you have three children,
and I guess the jury's out on them.

22:21.506 --> 22:25.033
Okay, and would you say
it's just like any other marriage

22:25.077 --> 22:27.238
of 14 years...
you never have sex?

22:27.279 --> 22:29.543
Oh, funny. Ha ha. Got that.

22:29.581 --> 22:33.210
I don't classify myself
as ex-gay, you know?

22:33.251 --> 22:35.549
I'm a heterosexual guy
who dealt

22:35.587 --> 22:39.148
with some homosexuality.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.285
Okay, so the people
who come here are people

22:42.327 --> 22:44.227
who are wanting to do what you did.

22:44.262 --> 22:48.221
They want to reform their life
and lead a heterosexual life.

22:48.266 --> 22:51.360
But I will be honest with you.
The reality's a lot of people come here

22:51.403 --> 22:54.338
and go right back
into whatever they came from.

22:54.373 --> 22:57.399
- Because they're gay!
- I believe that it's sin.

22:57.442 --> 23:01.242
Excuse me, but don't you have it,
no pun intended, ass-backwards?

23:01.279 --> 23:02.940
Meaning?

23:02.981 --> 23:05.677
Meaning homosexuality

23:05.717 --> 23:08.185
is something that occurs in nature.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.018
I was out bird watching,
but I'd rather watch you.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.614
Why don't you come over
and get some?

23:12.657 --> 23:15.922
Man is who wrote
the Bible.

23:15.961 --> 23:18.191
Nature made gay people.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.926
Nobody's born gay.
There's no scientific or...

23:20.966 --> 23:23.594
Really? Have you ever met
Little Richard?

23:23.635 --> 23:26.229
We can look at creation and say,
"What's the normal order?"

23:26.271 --> 23:28.432
A man has a penis.
A woman has a vagina.

23:28.473 --> 23:30.100
Let's just be blunt.

23:30.142 --> 23:32.440
There's no scientific
data that proves

23:32.477 --> 23:34.911
that anyone is...
there's no gay gene.

23:34.946 --> 23:36.743
And you also discovered
the gay gene?

23:36.782 --> 23:38.545
Yes.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.881
This is all coming from the Bible
which you believe...

23:40.919 --> 23:43.410
- Right.
...to be the word of God.

23:43.455 --> 23:45.685
- I do.
- All of the proscriptions

23:45.724 --> 23:49.285
against homosexuality come
from the Old Testament.

23:49.327 --> 23:51.761
Jesus never said a word
about homosexuality.

23:51.797 --> 23:53.992
And if it's so important,
why didn't he ever bring it up?

23:54.032 --> 23:56.865
We could pick lots of little things

23:56.902 --> 23:58.870
that he didn't
specifically talk about.

23:58.904 --> 24:02.670
- But this is a big thing.
- Let me stop this whole thing.

24:02.707 --> 24:05.642
You know, I'm not sure what
your documentary is about,

24:05.677 --> 24:09.636
but if it's to basically refute
the word of God,

24:09.681 --> 24:12.582
then I'm not interested
in doing your interview, okay?

24:12.617 --> 24:15.017
- Well, l...
- I think that

24:15.053 --> 24:17.112
obviously you don't have
the same relationship

24:17.155 --> 24:19.123
with Jesus Christ that I do.

24:19.157 --> 24:22.957
But what is your explanation
for the millions and millions of people

24:22.994 --> 24:24.586
around the world who are

24:24.629 --> 24:26.790
- leading homosexual lives...
- Well, it's not millions.

24:26.832 --> 24:30.791
...have no interest in anyone
of the opposite sex?

24:30.836 --> 24:33.361
Are they all faking
just to piss off Jesus?

24:33.405 --> 24:35.805
They didn't choose this.
They didn't desire it.

24:35.841 --> 24:37.331
Right, they were born gay.

24:37.375 --> 24:39.309
No, they weren't born that way.

24:39.344 --> 24:42.507
It's because of the insecurity
within theirselves.

24:42.547 --> 24:46.108
It takes a lot of security to walk out
of the house with assless chaps.

24:46.151 --> 24:49.552
- They're not happy, most of them.
- They're called gay.

24:49.588 --> 24:51.146
They took the word.

24:51.189 --> 24:53.316
Some of them look positively thrilled.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.557
No, they are people who
are really not complete

25:01.600 --> 25:03.192
in who they are
as men or women.

25:03.235 --> 25:06.170
That's a pretty big judgment
for a Christian.

25:06.204 --> 25:08.172
- It's not a judgment.
- That's not a judgment?

25:08.206 --> 25:10.504
That you are sitting here
telling these people

25:10.542 --> 25:13.102
who you don't even know
that they're incomplete

25:13.144 --> 25:14.634
because they're not like you?

25:14.679 --> 25:17.307
I mean, it's not the people you suspect

25:17.349 --> 25:18.907
that are gay, that are gay.

25:18.950 --> 25:21.544
People like
the Reverend Ted Haggard...

25:21.586 --> 25:23.884
Moral purity is better than immorality.

25:23.922 --> 25:27.380
...who kept meeting
homosexual prostitutes in a hotel room

25:27.425 --> 25:30.986
and having gay sex with speed.

25:31.029 --> 25:33.827
Evangelicals have the best
sex life of any other group.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.727
- Good Morning, Duane!
- But he wasn't gay?

25:37.769 --> 25:39.669
I already answered that.

25:39.704 --> 25:41.831
I don't believe that
anybody is gay.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.637
I don't know,
but honestly, if I just saw you

25:44.676 --> 25:48.339
in a bar or something, I would say...
and don't take this the wrong way...

25:48.380 --> 25:50.610
I would say, " Yeah,
I think that guy is gay."

25:50.649 --> 25:53.846
You're good looking.
You're neat, you know.

25:53.885 --> 25:56.547
- You don't look like me.
- Meaning?

25:56.588 --> 25:58.283
Meaning...

26:21.012 --> 26:22.946
- All right, thank you.
- Can I give you a hug?

26:22.981 --> 26:24.243
- Yes!
- I hug everybody,

26:24.282 --> 26:25.476
so can I give you a hug?

26:27.085 --> 26:29.053
- Thanks.
- Thank you very much.

26:29.087 --> 26:31.055
Hey, you didn't have
a hard-on there, did you?

26:31.089 --> 26:34.024
Nope, sorry. Can't do that.

26:35.860 --> 26:38.328
That was good, though.

26:38.363 --> 26:41.730
When I was 17,
my first girlfriend dumped me,

26:41.766 --> 26:45.099
and I was sad in a way
I'd never been sad.

26:45.136 --> 26:47.969
You know,
your first dumping is the worst.

26:48.006 --> 26:50.270
And at that point,
you're very vulnerable

26:50.308 --> 26:53.368
to any sort of connection

26:53.411 --> 26:55.242
with, you know...

26:55.280 --> 26:57.840
I didn't get like Jesus-religious,

26:57.882 --> 27:00.316
but I did think a force out there

27:00.352 --> 27:03.617
was communicating to me
through song lyrics or...

27:03.655 --> 27:07.022
numerology I was
very interested in for a while.

27:07.058 --> 27:10.926
You said you were groping
for something at that time.

27:10.962 --> 27:13.396
You know, you make up
an imaginary friend who loves you,

27:13.431 --> 27:15.797
is sympathetic to you
and has a plan for you.

27:15.834 --> 27:19.201
It's much more important.
He didn't have to love me, God,

27:19.237 --> 27:21.205
He just had
to be working for me.

27:21.239 --> 27:22.763
You know, He's like an agent.

27:22.807 --> 27:25.503
So you are an ex-Jew for Jesus.

27:25.543 --> 27:27.010
That is correct.

27:27.045 --> 27:30.947
Now what made you to decide
to be a follower of Christ?

27:30.982 --> 27:33.280
What brought Christ
into your life?

27:33.318 --> 27:36.549
Back in '75,

27:36.588 --> 27:38.613
I went to Michigan
State University.

27:38.657 --> 27:42.058
- $2,700?
- Yeah, it's pricey.

27:42.093 --> 27:44.789
Boy, I wonder what Madonna
without the child runs you.

27:44.829 --> 27:47.491
So getting back to my story,
I could ask God

27:47.532 --> 27:50.399
to do things in the name
of Jesus and they would happen.

27:50.435 --> 27:53.802
So I can't even recall
all the little miracles He did,

27:53.838 --> 27:57.239
but He proved to me that
He was real and He was there.

27:57.275 --> 28:00.005
They were so miraculous
and you can't remember what they were?

28:00.045 --> 28:01.672
There were so many of them
and they were little things.

28:01.713 --> 28:04.511
- Give me an example.
- One example I can remember was

28:04.549 --> 28:05.811
I was at a party.

28:05.850 --> 28:08.512
There was a guy who was working
with Jews for Jesus,

28:08.553 --> 28:11.852
and I asked him,
"Can I get a drink of water?"

28:11.890 --> 28:14.757
And he says,
"You know what? Here's a glass,

28:14.793 --> 28:16.693
stick your hand out the window
and pray for rain."

28:18.063 --> 28:19.553
I didn't like the attitude.

28:19.597 --> 28:21.121
I said okay,

28:21.166 --> 28:24.294
and I stuck my hand out the window
and it started pouring rain.

28:24.335 --> 28:28.066
Pouring so bad that people
couldn't leave the party.

28:28.106 --> 28:30.336
To me, that's a miracle.
You don't have to believe it,

28:30.375 --> 28:33.503
- but I know between me and God...
- It is pretty lame.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.309
- But you asked.
- I asked, but I'm just saying

28:36.347 --> 28:39.282
- that's my reaction to your answer.
- But that's just one of many things.

28:39.317 --> 28:41.376
I live a life of miracles.

28:41.419 --> 28:45.287
No, you live your life with the same
sort of mundane coincidences

28:45.323 --> 28:47.154
that happen to everybody
in the world.

28:47.192 --> 28:50.992
It's not like,
you know, if it rained frogs,

28:51.029 --> 28:52.656
I would say you had a point.

28:52.697 --> 28:54.665
But it rains, and it stops raining.

28:54.699 --> 28:56.860
Well, when was the last time
you asked for rain

28:56.901 --> 28:58.493
and it starting raining
within 10 seconds?

28:58.536 --> 29:00.333
I don't know.
I don't ever ask for rain.

29:00.371 --> 29:02.635
But if I asked for it really bad
and it started to rain,

29:02.674 --> 29:04.164
I wouldn't think it was
because I asked for it.

29:04.209 --> 29:06.609
I would think
because it sometimes rains.

29:06.644 --> 29:09.135
God is not that busy

29:09.180 --> 29:11.239
where He can't spend time
listening to you

29:11.282 --> 29:13.113
when you really want
to talk to Him, anytime.

29:13.151 --> 29:15.711
If Santa Claus can hit
every house in the world

29:15.754 --> 29:17.881
- in one night...
- I don't believe in Santa Claus.

29:17.922 --> 29:20.857
Of course not, that's ridiculous.
That's one man flying

29:20.892 --> 29:23.452
all around the world and dropping
presents down a chimney.

29:23.495 --> 29:26.259
That's ridiculous.
One man hearing everybody murmur

29:26.297 --> 29:28.663
to him at the same time, that I get.

29:30.401 --> 29:32.767
And you know what else
was very confusing to me?

29:32.804 --> 29:34.795
I remember vividly

29:34.839 --> 29:37.740
was Santa Claus

29:37.776 --> 29:40.643
- and Jesus.
- You were so mad at us.

29:40.678 --> 29:43.670
- Oh, yes.
- So mad at you, why? Oh, when...

29:43.715 --> 29:46.775
When you realized there
was no Santa Claus.

29:46.818 --> 29:49.548
And then when I found out
there was no Jesus,

29:49.587 --> 29:52.078
boy, was I pissed.

29:52.123 --> 29:54.683
You spoke before in certitude.

29:54.726 --> 29:56.751
You're 100% sure
that after you die,

29:56.795 --> 29:59.025
you'll go to a better place.

29:59.063 --> 30:01.930
I know I'll be with God.
I'll be with Jesus.

30:01.966 --> 30:03.695
And that's a better place.

30:03.735 --> 30:06.329
Even if it was in a garbage can,

30:06.371 --> 30:08.339
which I know it won't be,
but even if it was,

30:08.373 --> 30:11.137
just the fact that
I'm with Jesus, to me, is good.

30:11.176 --> 30:13.269
- It's a better place.
- It's a better place.

30:13.311 --> 30:16.769
Then why don't you kill yourself?

30:16.815 --> 30:18.578
Because God still has
a mission for me here.

30:18.616 --> 30:19.810
Oh, I see.

30:19.851 --> 30:23.378
I'm thinking of Jonah.
God sent Jonah on a mission.

30:23.421 --> 30:26.288
When did the part of the story come
when Jonah lived in the whale?

30:26.324 --> 30:28.315
It was a great fish.

30:28.359 --> 30:30.327
It's one of my favorite
nonsense stories,

30:30.361 --> 30:32.522
Jonah living inside
of the whale.

30:32.564 --> 30:36.364
And their answer unfailingly is

30:36.401 --> 30:39.700
"The Bible doesn't say whale.
It says big fish."

30:39.737 --> 30:41.728
Oh, yeah, big fish,
that makes...

30:41.773 --> 30:45.174
I'm sorry I was obsessing
on that it was a whale. It's a big fish.

30:45.210 --> 30:46.905
Of course you could live
for three days in a big fish.

30:46.945 --> 30:48.810
A tuna.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.941
They do it all the time in Japan.
They have tuna spas.

30:51.983 --> 30:55.214
You go for three days.
They pamper you, oils.

30:55.253 --> 30:58.586
You come out of that tuna
feeling fantastic.

30:58.623 --> 31:00.181
You smell like pussy,

31:00.225 --> 31:03.490
but you feel fantastic.

31:03.528 --> 31:06.361
This man lived inside
of a fish for three days?

31:06.397 --> 31:09.298
Miraculously, yes.

31:09.334 --> 31:11.859
Steve, Steve, Steve.

31:11.903 --> 31:13.632
You don't believe in miracles.

31:13.671 --> 31:16.333
- That doesn't mean they don't exist.
- Of course not!

31:16.374 --> 31:17.932
I'm not 10!

31:17.976 --> 31:19.910
He lived in a fish.

31:19.944 --> 31:22.606
Come on.

31:22.647 --> 31:25.878
Your bar on miracles is pretty low,
I gotta tell you, bro.

31:25.917 --> 31:27.942
Well, whatever.

31:27.986 --> 31:30.477
Two things that are
completely incompatible

31:30.521 --> 31:33.752
are Christianity
as Jesus taught it

31:33.791 --> 31:35.725
- and nationalism...
- Right. Exactly.

31:35.760 --> 31:39.025
...and yet people always
say God and country.

31:39.063 --> 31:41.691
Jesus would never...
you know,

31:41.733 --> 31:43.564
people who are
such good Christians...

31:43.601 --> 31:46.365
in one breath you'll hear them
say something like,

31:46.404 --> 31:48.304
"Well, you gotta take care
of your own first.

31:48.339 --> 31:51.069
I know people overseas have trouble,
but you gotta take"...

31:51.109 --> 31:54.977
that is not a message I can ever see
the Jesus in the Bible,

31:55.013 --> 31:57.982
even when he was
in a bad mood, would say.

32:02.153 --> 32:03.279
I'm gonna vote Bible.

32:03.321 --> 32:04.879
It's time for God's people to come

32:04.923 --> 32:08.086
out of the closets,
out of the churches

32:08.126 --> 32:09.957
and change America!

32:09.994 --> 32:11.586
Unless you and I do
what God wants us to do,

32:11.629 --> 32:13.790
he'll go to some other country.

32:13.831 --> 32:16.163
God, forgive America!

32:16.200 --> 32:20.136
I would probably have to say yes,
that the Constitution established

32:20.171 --> 32:22.935
the United States of America
as a Christian nation.

32:22.974 --> 32:25.568
We have, of course,
"In God We Trust" on our money.

32:25.610 --> 32:26.770
The Senate will come to order.

32:26.811 --> 32:28.005
The chaplain will lead
the Senate in prayer.

32:33.184 --> 32:36.950
How did this country
get to be a Christian nation?

32:36.988 --> 32:39.456
I've read a lot of quotes
from all the Founding Fathers.

32:39.490 --> 32:41.219
There are a lot of quotes
that explicitly say

32:41.259 --> 32:43.454
we're not a Christian nation.

32:55.373 --> 32:57.705
And Jefferson's
a particularly interesting case.

32:57.742 --> 33:01.405
Didn't he write his own Bible
which divorced the New Testament

33:01.446 --> 33:04.677
from what he considered
the unnecessary magic,

33:04.716 --> 33:06.445
bells and whistles?

33:06.484 --> 33:08.543
He took the Gospels,

33:08.586 --> 33:10.611
took out all of Jesus's miracles

33:10.655 --> 33:12.452
and took out
all of Jesus's statements

33:12.490 --> 33:14.720
that claimed divinity,

33:14.759 --> 33:17.057
and put out a new book called
"The Faith and Moral Teachings

33:17.095 --> 33:18.528
of Jesus of Nazareth."

33:18.563 --> 33:21.657
We tend to lionize these guys
and think of them all

33:21.699 --> 33:24.930
as the 12 Apostles
plus the Founding Fathers,

33:24.969 --> 33:27.233
like they're in the same
club or something.

33:27.271 --> 33:29.899
When in fact,
these men understood very well

33:29.941 --> 33:32.171
that there was a difference
between being Christian

33:32.210 --> 33:34.075
and being American.

33:34.112 --> 33:36.342
- Right.
- In Jefferson's age, fewer people went

33:36.381 --> 33:39.214
to church less often.

33:39.250 --> 33:41.582
Do you think that there
are a lot of people

33:41.619 --> 33:44.588
who feel the way you do,
but are afraid to speak out?

33:44.622 --> 33:46.385
Absolutely. Are you kidding?

33:46.424 --> 33:49.825
Yes, I think it is
the great untapped minority

33:49.861 --> 33:51.556
in this country.

33:51.596 --> 33:53.120
In the last survey,

33:53.164 --> 33:56.691
I think it was 16% of Americans

33:56.734 --> 33:59.760
who now say they are
absolutely unaffiliated

33:59.804 --> 34:02.398
with any religion,
don't want to be in a religion,

34:02.440 --> 34:04.203
just don't go near me
with religion.

34:04.242 --> 34:07.177
16% of the population is

34:07.211 --> 34:10.203
a huge minority.
It's bigger than Jews,

34:10.248 --> 34:14.150
blacks, homosexuals,
NRA members,

34:14.185 --> 34:16.676
lots of people you could name
who have lobbies

34:16.721 --> 34:19.246
that get everything they want

34:19.290 --> 34:23.192
or are at least are in the debate.

34:23.226 --> 34:25.353
You want me to kinda angle
like this or straight ahead?

34:25.396 --> 34:27.591
Just as natural as possible to Bill.

34:27.632 --> 34:30.862
So you've described yourself
as an Evangelical Christian.

34:30.902 --> 34:34.360
You did a campaign ad where you said
the most important lessons in life

34:34.405 --> 34:37.306
are in this book right here,
meaning the Bible.

34:37.341 --> 34:41.072
Everyone in politics likes
to brag that they're a person of faith.

34:41.112 --> 34:43.739
Why is faith good?

34:43.781 --> 34:45.772
Faith has a way

34:45.817 --> 34:48.114
of softening people.

34:48.152 --> 34:51.417
For example, if you look at the
teachings of Jesus, he's very forgiving.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.514
He also said,
"If a man doesn't abide in me,

34:53.558 --> 34:56.425
he is cast forth
as a branch and withers,

34:56.460 --> 35:00.022
and the branches are gathered,
thrown into the fire and burned."

35:00.064 --> 35:03.431
Right. So?

35:03.468 --> 35:05.299
I do think, 'cause I'm a Christian,

35:05.336 --> 35:08.100
that Jesus is the way
to be reconciled.

35:08.139 --> 35:12.769
And I do believe
the actual literacy of that story.

35:12.810 --> 35:17.270
We'll let God sort out all the details
of that on Judgment Day.

35:17.315 --> 35:19.044
What about
the 10 Commandments?

35:19.083 --> 35:22.416
So many politicians talk
about the 10 Commandments.

35:22.453 --> 35:24.648
Are they really the 10 most

35:24.689 --> 35:27.089
- important moral...
- Are these the 10 suggestions?

35:27.125 --> 35:29.616
The 10 recommendations?

35:29.660 --> 35:32.026
But it's not really a wide list of 10.

35:32.063 --> 35:34.031
The first four are all

35:34.065 --> 35:37.364
about just worshipping God
and basically that he's a jealous God,

35:37.401 --> 35:39.528
and he doesn't want you
to have any other gods.

35:39.570 --> 35:41.663
The only two that are really laws

35:41.706 --> 35:43.697
are don't steal and don't kill.

35:43.741 --> 35:45.971
Why is this the wisest group of 10?

35:46.010 --> 35:49.707
It doesn't include child abuse.
It doesn't include don't torture.

35:49.747 --> 35:51.840
It doesn't include
a lot of things... rape...

35:51.883 --> 35:54.681
that I think if we were
making a list today,

35:54.719 --> 35:56.380
we would probably include.

35:56.420 --> 35:58.820
Society is so different today

35:58.856 --> 36:01.347
and our culture is
so radically different today.

36:01.392 --> 36:03.952
That's what I'm asking.
We're in a different culture.

36:03.995 --> 36:07.624
Can you think of anything else that
we still cleave to from the Bronze Age?

36:07.665 --> 36:09.496
Well...

36:28.553 --> 36:31.249
Basically, murder is against the law
in every country in the world.

36:31.289 --> 36:34.281
But wouldn't we have come
to that even without religion?

36:34.325 --> 36:37.021
Don't you think people would
have gotten together and said,

36:37.061 --> 36:39.154
"You know what?
Let's not slaughter each other

36:39.197 --> 36:42.894
- and not take each other's stuff."
- I don't know.

36:42.934 --> 36:45.732
There's been more killing
in the name of "My God."

36:45.770 --> 36:49.206
You think maybe sort of indigously

36:49.240 --> 36:51.435
or just by our DNA,

36:51.475 --> 36:54.273
we somehow know that killing
another person is wrong?

36:54.312 --> 36:56.940
I'm not sure that that's the case.

36:56.981 --> 36:59.677
Really, you need God
to decide not to kill each other?

36:59.717 --> 37:03.118
Well, you can look back
at more primitive cultures,

37:03.154 --> 37:06.783
and they were constantly at war.

37:10.962 --> 37:14.420
We are now, among industrialized,
modern nations,

37:14.465 --> 37:16.695
the most religious nation.

37:16.734 --> 37:18.793
A recent study found that

37:18.836 --> 37:20.895
among 32 countries,

37:20.938 --> 37:23.532
more people in this country
doubted evolution

37:23.574 --> 37:27.305
than any other country on that list,
except, I think, it was Turkey.

37:27.345 --> 37:29.711
In the US,
we have freedom of religion.

37:29.747 --> 37:32.045
I think most of the countries on
that list do have freedom of religion.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.983
Well, that's interesting.

37:34.018 --> 37:35.280
Do you believe in evolution?

37:35.319 --> 37:38.220
You know my... I don't know.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.986
Clearly the scientific community's
a little divided

37:41.025 --> 37:44.392
on some of the specifics
of that and I understand that.

37:44.428 --> 37:47.261
- I don't think they are.
- No no... well...

37:47.298 --> 37:49.323
I think they pretty much agree.

37:49.367 --> 37:51.198
I don't know how it all happened.

37:51.235 --> 37:54.261
I'm certainly willing to accept
the scientific premise.

37:54.305 --> 37:56.967
It couldn't possibly
have been Adam and Eve

37:57.008 --> 38:00.136
5,000 years ago with a talking snake
and a garden, could it?

38:00.177 --> 38:01.838
Well, it could've
possibly been that.

38:01.879 --> 38:04.439
Come on.
See, this is my problem.

38:04.482 --> 38:06.814
I mean, you're a senator.

38:06.851 --> 38:09.149
You are one
of the very few people

38:09.186 --> 38:10.949
who are really
running this country.

38:10.988 --> 38:14.947
It worries me that people are
running my country who think...

38:14.992 --> 38:16.619
who believe
in a talking snake.

38:16.661 --> 38:19.357
You don't have to pass an IQ test
to be in the Senate, though.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.838
As you first come
into the Creation Museum,

38:31.876 --> 38:33.343
there's going to be a sense

38:33.377 --> 38:35.106
of "This is something really big."

38:35.146 --> 38:38.240
This is something awe-inspiring,
something great here.

38:38.282 --> 38:40.750
We can answer the questions
of the skeptics

38:40.785 --> 38:42.514
that attack
the Bible's history.

38:42.553 --> 38:45.215
We admit that we start
from the Bible here

38:45.256 --> 38:46.780
to teach them how to think.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.985
Really, in a nutshell,
we're saying, the Bible's true

38:49.026 --> 38:50.721
from Genesis to Revelation.

38:55.733 --> 38:58.099
We're building the whole place
for about $27 million.

39:01.105 --> 39:02.663
I have many people say to me,

39:02.707 --> 39:04.607
"As a Christian,
can't you believe in evolution?"

39:04.642 --> 39:07.202
I say, " Well, you got a problem.
God made a man and a woman."

39:07.244 --> 39:10.008
If you believe in evolution, the woman
had to come from an ape woman.

39:10.047 --> 39:14.040
All right,
but you're so damned ugly.

39:15.419 --> 39:19.185
This is what we call the main hall
here. Immediately, people see

39:19.223 --> 39:21.020
dinosaurs and people together,
which is very different

39:21.058 --> 39:24.687
to the idea of the evolutionists
who say dinosaurs died out

39:24.729 --> 39:27.994
70 million ago or so,
and so they didn't live with humans.

39:28.032 --> 39:31.024
They see an animatronic
dinosaur over here.

39:31.068 --> 39:33.696
Two animatronic baby T-Rexes
and two animatronic children.

39:33.738 --> 39:37.174
It's basically just to give people
a wow factor as they come in here.

39:41.379 --> 39:45.213
How to share your faith
effectively and Biblically,

39:45.249 --> 39:46.807
to be able to reason
with people,

39:46.851 --> 39:48.580
learn to circumnavigate

39:48.619 --> 39:50.610
or go around
the person's intellect.

39:50.654 --> 39:54.215
There's plenty of people who
would say, "Well, it's just my faith."

39:54.258 --> 39:56.954
But that's not good enough
for you. You say, " No.

39:56.994 --> 39:59.462
We can basically
reconcile the science

39:59.497 --> 40:02.193
with what's in Genesis."

40:02.233 --> 40:05.100
We're an organization that...
to put it in a nutshell...

40:05.136 --> 40:07.764
is telling people that
the Bible's history is true,

40:07.805 --> 40:09.102
its history beginning
in Genesis.

40:09.140 --> 40:12.541
Scientists line up
overwhelmingly

40:12.576 --> 40:14.771
on one side of this issue.
It would have to be

40:14.812 --> 40:18.578
an enormous conspiracy
going on between scientists

40:18.616 --> 40:21.244
of all different disciplines
in all different countries

40:21.285 --> 40:23.913
to have such a consensus.

40:23.954 --> 40:25.478
That doesn't move you?

40:25.523 --> 40:28.014
No, not at all, because from
a Biblical perspective,

40:28.058 --> 40:31.289
I understand why the majority
would not agree with the truth.

40:31.328 --> 40:34.422
Man is a sinner.
Man is rebelling against his creator.

40:34.465 --> 40:37.332
All these scientists
are sinners?

40:37.368 --> 40:39.427
Well...

40:39.470 --> 40:42.598
We have been talking
to so many religious people

40:42.640 --> 40:45.074
and many of them believe
the earth is 5,000 years old.

40:45.109 --> 40:47.577
If you're a scientist,
you can't accept that.

40:47.611 --> 40:50.944
Now you recently were the director
of the Vatican Observatory.

40:50.981 --> 40:53.142
A Vatican astronomer.

40:53.184 --> 40:56.119
It's one of those terms
like "gay Republican"...

40:56.153 --> 40:58.121
you know,
you just don't expect it.

40:58.155 --> 41:01.647
- I'm not getting into that.
- No no no, I'm not asking you to.

41:01.692 --> 41:03.683
It's not that the church
has the idea, you know,

41:03.727 --> 41:06.992
they're gonna train us up
so we can be the first ones out there

41:07.031 --> 41:09.158
to baptize those extraterrestrials

41:09.200 --> 41:11.293
before the Mormons get at 'em.

41:11.335 --> 41:13.929
The reason is simply

41:13.971 --> 41:16.599
historical facts.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.837
John Paul II,
for instance, said evolution

41:19.877 --> 41:23.836
in the neo-Darwinian sense is
no longer a mere hypothesis.

41:23.881 --> 41:26.179
I mean, he said that.
It's in writing.

41:26.217 --> 41:28.708
I still don't understand
why it's important

41:28.752 --> 41:31.312
for there to have to have been
a situation on earth

41:31.355 --> 41:34.017
where a man co-existed
with dinosaurs.

41:34.058 --> 41:35.616
Only really
in "The Flintstones"...

41:35.659 --> 41:37.627
Is someone talking about me?

41:37.661 --> 41:39.185
...and that Raquel Welch movie

41:39.230 --> 41:42.722
does man ever co-exist
with dinosaurs.

41:42.766 --> 41:46.668
Why is that important
for your salvation or your morality?

41:46.704 --> 41:48.433
If you're saying
this part over here,

41:48.472 --> 41:51.236
it says God made land animals
and man on the same day is not true,

41:51.275 --> 41:54.369
then ultimately, why should
I believe this bit over here?

41:54.411 --> 41:58.142
The Christian Scriptures
were written

41:58.182 --> 42:00.980
between about 2,000 years
before Christ

42:01.018 --> 42:03.077
to about 200 years after Christ.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.314
That's it.

42:04.355 --> 42:07.813
Modern science came
to be with Galileo

42:07.858 --> 42:10.224
up through Newton,
up through Einstein.

42:10.261 --> 42:13.424
What we know
as modern science, okay,

42:13.464 --> 42:14.931
is in that period.

42:14.965 --> 42:18.298
How in the world could
there be any science

42:18.335 --> 42:20.064
in scripture?

42:20.104 --> 42:21.696
There cannot be.

42:21.739 --> 42:24.367
Just the two historical
periods are separated

42:24.408 --> 42:26.103
by so much.

42:26.143 --> 42:28.077
The Scriptures are not

42:28.112 --> 42:30.273
teaching science.

42:30.314 --> 42:32.282
It's very hard for me to accept,

42:32.316 --> 42:35.843
not just a literal interpretation
of scripture,

42:35.886 --> 42:38.684
but a fundamentalist approach
to religious belief.

42:38.722 --> 42:40.587
It's kind of a plague.

42:40.624 --> 42:43.354
It presents itself
as science and it's not.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.692
God is an infinite God
who is working in ways

42:45.729 --> 42:48.357
- we don't always understand.
- You don't think that's a cop-out?

42:48.399 --> 42:51.061
He is God.

42:51.101 --> 42:52.625
Are you God?

42:54.238 --> 42:55.933
No.

42:59.476 --> 43:01.273
We went to church every Sunday.

43:01.312 --> 43:04.941
My sister and I went to Catechism,
which is Catholic, you know,

43:04.982 --> 43:08.383
like Hebrew school for papists.

43:08.419 --> 43:09.886
It was like war.

43:09.920 --> 43:13.048
It was vast stretches
of boredom punctuated

43:13.090 --> 43:15.786
by moments of sheer terror.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.423
I'm in the Vatican.

43:29.206 --> 43:31.037
Buongiorno!

43:31.075 --> 43:33.976
I know what you're thinking.
I'm standing in front of a green screen

43:34.011 --> 43:35.911
at a studio
in Burbank, California,

43:35.946 --> 43:38.437
and they digitalized
the Vatican in behind me.

43:38.482 --> 43:41.144
No no, that's really the Vatican.

43:41.185 --> 43:43.153
I ought to know.
I just got thrown out of it.

43:43.187 --> 43:45.052
See, I wanted
to interview the Pope,

43:45.089 --> 43:48.991
but I was willing to settle
for a cardinal or a monsignor

43:49.026 --> 43:51.153
or the Flying Nun...
really anybody...

43:51.195 --> 43:54.653
but apparently I've been on the
Catholic shit list for quite a while.

43:54.698 --> 43:57.690
But that's their loss, 'cause now
I'm gonna say what I really think,

43:57.735 --> 43:59.794
which is mainly:

43:59.837 --> 44:01.429
Does that look anything

44:01.472 --> 44:04.270
like anything Jesus Christ
had in mind?

44:04.308 --> 44:07.641
When you look at a building
like that, a giant palace,

44:07.678 --> 44:09.873
does it seem at odds
with the message of the founder?

44:09.913 --> 44:11.437
Well, certainly.

44:11.482 --> 44:14.883
- Well, thank you.
- I mean, that's obvious.

44:14.918 --> 44:18.445
It really is obvious, isn't it?
But does it bother you?

44:18.489 --> 44:21.856
Well, I mean...
well, yes it does.

44:21.892 --> 44:24.452
I wouldn't...
if I were the boss,

44:24.495 --> 44:26.395
I wouldn't be living there.

44:26.430 --> 44:29.422
I mean Jesus would be
probably out in some barracks here

44:29.466 --> 44:32.663
in a suburb of Rome, got it?

44:32.703 --> 44:35.536
Do you ever get so fed up
you want to take the collar and go...

44:35.572 --> 44:37.563
- Well, I don't wear a collar anyway.
..." That's it, Captain.

44:37.608 --> 44:39.633
Take my badge and my collar."

44:39.677 --> 44:42.874
I read about 10 books recently...
the rationality of religion,

44:42.913 --> 44:45.473
and everyone's saying it's stupid.

44:46.750 --> 44:48.718
You know what's
gonna happen to them.

44:48.752 --> 44:50.413
- No, what's gonna happen?
- They're gonna be roasting in hell.

44:50.454 --> 44:53.082
Come on, roasting.
That's the old Catholic thing.

44:53.123 --> 44:54.590
That's what they taught me.

44:54.625 --> 44:56.388
Yeah, I know, that hell business.

44:56.427 --> 44:59.225
Well, come on, the standard doctrine
that I was taught as a kid...

44:59.263 --> 45:01.424
Yeah, that's all gone.
That's all finished.

45:01.465 --> 45:02.932
But that's not fair.

45:02.966 --> 45:06.265
- Yeah, pfft!
- The date of Jesus's birth

45:06.303 --> 45:08.771
really wasn't established
until 349 A.D.

45:08.806 --> 45:11.001
Oh, yeah...

45:11.041 --> 45:13.703
because he might've
been born on July 3rd.

45:13.744 --> 45:17.271
These are all
nice stories, you know.

45:17.314 --> 45:19.646
- And that doesn't bother you, either?
- That bothers me too.

45:19.683 --> 45:22.015
I mean, when everybody's,
"Ooh, we have to have midnight mass

45:22.052 --> 45:24.850
because Jesus was born
on midnight on 25th of"...

45:24.888 --> 45:26.788
this is all nonsense.

45:26.824 --> 45:28.917
- You're a maverick, aren't you?
- I'm not a maverick.

45:28.959 --> 45:32.554
You're Father Maverick.
You do things your own way.

45:37.968 --> 45:40.960
When you add up
all the saints and all the angels

45:41.004 --> 45:43.598
and archangels
and super-duper angels...

45:43.640 --> 45:46.632
there's God, the Father,
God the Son, the Holy Ghost,

45:46.677 --> 45:49.407
Mother Mary...
it does start to look like

45:49.446 --> 45:52.176
it's not quite
the monotheistic religion that it's...

45:52.216 --> 45:54.616
Oh, I understand.
Like we have mini-gods.

45:54.651 --> 45:58.087
Yeah, well, it does seem like that,
if people pray to a...

45:58.122 --> 46:00.249
Well, yeah, but some people
just don't understand this.

46:00.290 --> 46:02.815
You probably are...
you don't follow things...

46:02.860 --> 46:05.454
but they had a survey here
in Italy, you know,

46:05.496 --> 46:07.464
and they said, " In a crisis,

46:07.498 --> 46:10.126
what kind of saints
do you pray to?" Got it?

46:10.167 --> 46:13.261
You know who's the sixth
on the list? Jesus Christ.

46:13.303 --> 46:14.998
The sixth?

46:15.038 --> 46:18.530
He's the sixth man
that the Italians call upon

46:18.575 --> 46:21.009
when they have problems.
Isn't that neat?

46:21.044 --> 46:25.413
- That's very interesting.
- Talk about Cafeteria Catholics. Pfft!

46:25.449 --> 46:27.440
So how do you convince people
of what's the true faith?

46:27.484 --> 46:30.419
You don't, forget it.
You just have to live and die

46:30.454 --> 46:33.355
with their stupid ideas.

46:33.390 --> 46:35.620
I'm sorry.
What are you gonna do?

46:35.659 --> 46:37.627
You can go to a pitch meeting
at a movie studio and go,

46:37.661 --> 46:40.061
"Okay, there's a spaceman

46:40.097 --> 46:41.792
who zaps a virgin

46:41.832 --> 46:44.699
and he gives birth
to a son who's also him,

46:44.735 --> 46:46.635
who then goes
on a suicide mission."

46:46.670 --> 46:48.103
I wonder what people
would say about that.

46:48.138 --> 46:50.299
Yeah, that is actually
a great pitch.

46:50.340 --> 46:52.604
It has so many elements
that they like,

46:52.643 --> 46:54.611
because they love
suicide missions.

46:54.645 --> 46:57.443
They love violence,
and Hollywood loves something

46:57.481 --> 47:00.314
it's never seen before... a virgin.

47:16.767 --> 47:18.667
Hey, Shalom.

47:24.675 --> 47:27.701
We're so glad to have you here.
Just come and get blessed.

47:34.017 --> 47:35.848
These are here to teach God's word.

47:35.886 --> 47:37.683
We're in a spiritual warfare.

47:37.721 --> 47:39.712
We don't push our beliefs on people,

47:39.756 --> 47:41.815
but we do make them available.

47:41.859 --> 47:44.726
- Have you ever had a Muslim person?
- Yes, definitely.

47:44.761 --> 47:46.592
People from Gaza Strip come.

47:49.766 --> 47:51.893
We get many people
who come here say,

47:51.935 --> 47:54.165
"We've come every year
to Florida

47:54.204 --> 47:57.435
and we've done the tourist
things and all and we enjoy those.

47:57.474 --> 48:00.705
We wish we had
seen this first,"

48:00.744 --> 48:04.009
because their experience
here was so meaningful.

48:04.047 --> 48:07.039
Do you think if...
when you were a kid...

48:07.084 --> 48:10.349
they transposed the Bible stories

48:10.387 --> 48:12.878
with the fairy tales, you'd know
the difference as an adult?

48:14.157 --> 48:16.819
- My name is Eve.
- I'm Adam.

48:16.860 --> 48:18.794
This place is amazing.

48:18.829 --> 48:21.593
If they told you Jack
and the Beanstalk was religion

48:21.632 --> 48:24.726
and that a man who lived
in a whale was in a fairy-tale book...

48:26.169 --> 48:28.262
you think when you got
to be an adult,

48:28.305 --> 48:30.296
you'd be defending
the one instead of the other?

48:30.340 --> 48:32.433
So you're saying that
the Bible's a fairy tale?

48:32.476 --> 48:35.377
God took my rib like this

48:35.412 --> 48:37.346
and began to whittle it

48:37.381 --> 48:39.246
like this

48:39.283 --> 48:42.719
and blow on it...
and then...

48:42.753 --> 48:45.517
Saved means believing
in Jesus Christ

48:45.555 --> 48:47.318
- as the only begotten Son of God.
- Not for me, it don't.

48:47.357 --> 48:49.257
What about the Muslims?

48:49.293 --> 48:51.591
Many Muslims are
saved right now.

48:51.628 --> 48:53.061
I don't get it.

48:53.096 --> 48:55.496
I pray in your lifetime you do.

48:55.532 --> 48:59.161
Jesus came through a Jew.
He was not the seed of man.

48:59.202 --> 49:01.170
He came through
a Jewish woman,

49:01.204 --> 49:02.796
but no man had
ever touched her.

49:02.839 --> 49:04.864
No flesh had ever
touched her.

49:04.908 --> 49:07.206
He was the seed of God.

49:26.129 --> 49:27.721
You want me to lean up against
the tomb or something

49:27.764 --> 49:30.790
or you want casual or... okay.

49:30.834 --> 49:32.426
Did I give you my cell phone?

49:32.469 --> 49:34.767
Oh, I left my cell phone, right?
Just want to make sure.

49:34.805 --> 49:36.705
Testing one two,
check, testing.

49:36.740 --> 49:39.607
How you doing, Bill?
God bless you.

49:39.643 --> 49:40.871
- Hi.
- Seen you around.

49:40.911 --> 49:43.311
- Welcome to our world.
- I've seen you around.

49:43.347 --> 49:46.544
Now is this your tomb?
Is this a real rock?

49:46.583 --> 49:49.211
No, it's just cement.
They just kind of cemented it in there.

49:49.252 --> 49:51.982
So when you go out to dinner,
people recognize you?

49:52.022 --> 49:53.319
All the time, yeah.

49:53.357 --> 49:55.917
I think you get
a little bit of that, too.

49:55.959 --> 49:59.486
But they don't think I'm the Lord.
You must really be...

49:59.529 --> 50:02.498
Why do you think people come here?
'Cause Disneyland's too smutty?

50:02.532 --> 50:04.261
I personally haven't been
to the Holy Land,

50:04.301 --> 50:06.235
so this was an awesome experience
for me when I walked on the property.

50:06.269 --> 50:09.636
- I was like, "Wow, this is cool."
- Let me ask you questions

50:09.673 --> 50:11.072
- about your business...
- Yes.

50:11.108 --> 50:14.544
...or really the Jesus business.
God is super powerful.

50:14.578 --> 50:16.239
- He can do anything.
- Sure.

50:16.279 --> 50:19.442
Why doesn't
he just obliterate the devil

50:19.483 --> 50:22.748
and therefore get rid
of evil in the world?

50:22.786 --> 50:25.516
- He will.
- He will? What's he waiting for?

50:25.555 --> 50:27.523
- End times.
- But why play it out like that?

50:27.557 --> 50:29.991
- Why make it a game?
- Well, it's not necessarily a game.

50:30.027 --> 50:33.155
A day is like a thousand years
in God's eyes, it says in the Bible.

50:33.196 --> 50:35.562
If you wanna look at it...
just like two days ago, Christ died.

50:35.599 --> 50:39.126
But I know that he is
so far beyond any of our ways,

50:39.169 --> 50:41.660
that he can work
the worst situation for his good.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.696
What was the Holocaust?
Why was that good?

50:43.740 --> 50:46.208
You know, God had a plan for that.
Maybe it's to cause...

50:46.243 --> 50:48.040
I wonder if you would have thought
that if you were one of the people

50:48.078 --> 50:50.171
- being pushed into an oven.
- Well, you know what?

50:50.213 --> 50:52.545
It's like trying to explain
to an ant how a TV works.

50:52.582 --> 50:55.107
That's... God's ways are
so much higher than ours.

50:55.152 --> 50:57.882
There's no way
you can understand that.

50:57.921 --> 50:59.718
We need to stop the interview
for just a moment, please.

50:59.756 --> 51:01.587
- Nice to see you.
- Senior manager of public relations.

51:01.625 --> 51:04.788
- Hi, Les, I'll be right with you.
- Hi. Sure.

51:12.969 --> 51:15.233
I'm not afraid
of the piranha women.

51:15.272 --> 51:17.900
When he came, he said, " I come not
to abolish the law, but to fulfill it."

51:17.941 --> 51:20.466
You boil all those
Levitical laws down to two things:

51:20.510 --> 51:22.034
No other God is before me, Bill,

51:22.079 --> 51:23.944
and love the Lord with all your heart.

51:23.980 --> 51:25.743
But, Jesus, having
no other gods before you,

51:25.782 --> 51:28.478
that's not moral.
There's nothing moral about that.

51:28.518 --> 51:31.180
It's just something
a jealous god would do.

51:31.221 --> 51:33.212
It does say that our God
is a jealous god.

51:33.256 --> 51:36.953
But your God is jealous?
That seems so unGodlike

51:36.993 --> 51:39.257
that God would have such
a petty human emotion.

51:39.296 --> 51:41.764
I know people who have
gotten over jealousy,

51:41.798 --> 51:43.857
- let alone God.
- There's two sides to the coin.

51:43.900 --> 51:46.630
He's a just God
and he's also a merciful God.

51:46.670 --> 51:50.629
No, he spends the first five books
of the Bible wiping out people.

51:50.674 --> 51:53.905
That's what he chose to do.
His ways are higher than ours, Bill.

51:53.944 --> 51:56.572
- Maybe our thinking should be higher.
- That's a good point.

51:56.613 --> 51:59.582
God has got
this God-sized hole in your life.

51:59.616 --> 52:01.447
You can fit that
with any position...

52:01.485 --> 52:04.079
drugs, sex, whatever you want...
it is not gonna fill it.

52:04.121 --> 52:05.645
- Can I try?
- You can try all you want.

52:05.689 --> 52:06.815
You're gonna end up
hurting yourself,

52:06.857 --> 52:08.620
damaging yourself
and burning yourself up.

52:08.658 --> 52:10.853
I thought Christ was
about not judging people.

52:10.894 --> 52:13.124
- That's true.
- Isn't that a judgment there?

52:13.163 --> 52:15.688
You don't know me and you're telling me
I need to fill a hole in my heart

52:15.732 --> 52:17.757
- with drugs and sex.
- No, I'm not talking about you.

52:17.801 --> 52:19.325
I'm saying anyone in general.

52:19.369 --> 52:22.634
See, if I was God, I would create people
without the hole to begin with.

52:22.672 --> 52:26.369
Have you ever had a little voice in
the back of your mind say something?

52:26.409 --> 52:28.206
- We've all had that.
- That's called the Holy Spirit.

52:28.245 --> 52:30.679
- That's not God. That's you.
- That's called the Holy Spirit.

52:30.714 --> 52:32.011
- Feel this wind right now?
- Yeah.

52:32.048 --> 52:34.016
Okay, where is it?
You don't know, right?

52:34.050 --> 52:36.678
- Yeah, it's called wind.
- Okay, that's like the Holy Spirit.

52:36.720 --> 52:39.712
It's a monotheistic religion,
but there's three of them.

52:39.756 --> 52:42.190
Just like water can be ice,
steam and water.

52:42.225 --> 52:44.022
I see.

52:44.060 --> 52:46.221
It's different forms, different shapes
for the different purposes.

52:46.263 --> 52:48.424
The analogy that Jesus
at the amusement park

52:48.465 --> 52:50.330
said yesterday was brilliant,

52:50.367 --> 52:53.029
about the Trinity is like water.

52:53.069 --> 52:55.264
It can be steam. It can be ice.

52:55.305 --> 52:58.138
It can be liquid.
Wow, that is...

52:58.175 --> 53:01.110
boy, that stopped me
in my tracks for a second, you know?

53:01.144 --> 53:03.044
That's just a brilliant analogy.

53:03.079 --> 53:04.546
When you think about it
for two minutes,

53:04.581 --> 53:07.072
it's still complete bullshit.

53:07.117 --> 53:09.176
There this space God
and he's himself

53:09.219 --> 53:11.483
and he sent himself
on a suicide mission.

53:11.521 --> 53:14.547
He's a God, but he has a kid.
He's a single parent.

53:14.591 --> 53:18.527
It's just silly, but when you put it
in the water analogy,

53:18.562 --> 53:20.792
I can see that, you know,
those ladies there,

53:20.830 --> 53:22.957
when they heard that the first time,
they were like, done.

53:22.999 --> 53:26.730
Sold. Oh, you had me
at ice cube.

53:26.770 --> 53:29.398
Moving on.
Does it ever bother you

53:29.439 --> 53:32.931
that the story of a man

53:32.976 --> 53:36.377
who was born of a virgin
was resurrected?

53:36.413 --> 53:39.610
Your bio was something that was
going around the Mediterranean

53:39.649 --> 53:41.344
for at least 1,000 years.

53:41.384 --> 53:44.046
We've got Krishna who was in India

53:44.087 --> 53:46.681
1,000 years before Christ.
Krishna was a carpenter,

53:46.723 --> 53:49.419
born of a virgin, baptized in a river.

53:49.459 --> 53:51.427
Are you saying that
was written in history?

53:51.461 --> 53:53.224
That was written down in history,
is that what you're saying?

53:53.263 --> 53:56.926
Absolutely, there's the Persian god
Mithra, 600 years before Christ.

53:56.967 --> 53:59.595
Born December 25th,
performed miracles,

53:59.636 --> 54:01.536
resurrected on the third day,

54:01.571 --> 54:05.029
known as the Lamb, the Way, the Truth,
the Light, the Savior, Messiah.

54:05.075 --> 54:07.202
Stop! Blasphemer!

54:07.244 --> 54:09.508
All I know is that
I don't go by that hearsay.

54:09.546 --> 54:12.743
I go by the word of God.
I know that's why I believe.

54:12.782 --> 54:15.683
- Well, I believe it because it's truth.
- Believe it, yes.

54:15.719 --> 54:18.210
But there's a difference
between truth and what you believe.

54:18.255 --> 54:21.520
In the Bible it tells us that all things
are possible with God, okay?

54:21.558 --> 54:23.788
Study the religions
of the Mediterranean region

54:23.827 --> 54:25.385
for a thousand years before.

54:25.428 --> 54:29.296
Many of the gods were born
on December 25th.

54:29.332 --> 54:31.994
- No, it's not.
- It's not a new one.

54:32.035 --> 54:34.060
It's funny you should bring
that up because of course

54:34.104 --> 54:35.765
in " Star Wars: Episode l...
The Phantom Menace,"

54:35.805 --> 54:37.466
Anakin is born to a virgin.

54:37.507 --> 54:38.838
People see that
and say, " Wait a second.

54:38.875 --> 54:41.105
Where have we heard that before?"
That's not original.

54:41.144 --> 54:43.908
- But the Jesus story wasn't original.
- How so?

55:34.264 --> 55:36.858
Let me ask you a question.
Let's say, if you take the side

55:36.900 --> 55:40.165
- that this is all made up...
- I do.

55:40.203 --> 55:41.534
...what if you're wrong?

55:42.972 --> 55:44.701
What if you're wrong?

55:55.251 --> 55:59.119
# Down the Via Dolorosa #

55:59.155 --> 56:02.682
# In Jerusalem that day #

56:02.726 --> 56:04.990
# The soldiers tried #

56:05.028 --> 56:08.555
# To clear
the narrow street #

56:10.033 --> 56:13.901
# But the crowd
pressed in to see #

56:13.937 --> 56:16.167
# The man condemned to die #

56:16.206 --> 56:19.266
# On Calvary #

56:21.044 --> 56:24.207
# Down the Via Dolorosa #

56:24.247 --> 56:27.944
# Called the Way of Suffering #

56:27.984 --> 56:31.215
# Like a lamb came the Messiah #

56:31.254 --> 56:33.518
# Christ the King #

56:35.225 --> 56:38.194
# And he chose to walk that road #

56:38.228 --> 56:41.288
# Out of his love #

56:41.331 --> 56:43.561
# For you #

56:43.600 --> 56:46.933
# And me. #

57:06.990 --> 57:09.220
Was Jesus a sinner?

57:09.259 --> 57:12.888
One master. One word.
I am your master.

57:15.632 --> 57:18.658
Who do we put away
in the asylums?

57:26.276 --> 57:28.301
Xenu brought us here

57:28.344 --> 57:30.312
75 million years ago,

57:30.346 --> 57:33.042
stacked us around volcanoes

57:33.082 --> 57:35.346
and blew them up with an H-bomb.

57:38.721 --> 57:40.712
We are older than the universe.

57:44.694 --> 57:46.958
You have to rid yourself

57:46.996 --> 57:48.623
of the implants

57:48.665 --> 57:51.759
from the extraterrestrial dictators!

57:55.405 --> 57:59.034
- Get an E-Meter. Yes, get an E-Meter!
- An E-meter?

58:02.679 --> 58:04.146
Audit yourself.

58:07.517 --> 58:10.577
How do you people expect
to get to the next level?

58:13.223 --> 58:15.248
I'm not making the rules.

58:17.026 --> 58:19.017
Aw...

58:21.064 --> 58:23.464
You know, Scientologists...

58:26.503 --> 58:30.405
And right, you're like,
"Oh, yeah, that's some crazy shit. Okay.

58:30.440 --> 58:33.375
Jesus with the virgin birth
and the dove and the snake

58:33.409 --> 58:36.810
who talked in the garden,
that's cool.

58:36.846 --> 58:40.009
But the Scientologists,
they're the crazy ones."

58:40.049 --> 58:41.209
That's not true.

58:41.251 --> 58:43.412
That... that...
I don't have any idea

58:43.453 --> 58:45.683
of what
you're talking about.

58:45.722 --> 58:47.747
But it has something to do
with making sure

58:47.790 --> 58:49.985
that we're born with a defect,

58:50.026 --> 58:51.823
so that the souls of ours

58:51.861 --> 58:54.227
are infected with aliens...

58:54.264 --> 58:56.732
Thank you.

58:56.766 --> 59:00.725
...because the cure?
Scientology.

59:00.770 --> 59:04.206
They're all crazy.
Yes, the religions do get even crazier.

59:04.240 --> 59:06.731
They have to to keep up.

59:06.776 --> 59:09.210
They keep raising the bar.
After you've done the virgin birth,

59:09.245 --> 59:11.406
you know,
where do you go?

59:28.398 --> 59:30.093
We're not getting the top?

59:30.133 --> 59:31.862
- We got the top.
- Oh, okay.

59:31.901 --> 59:33.960
That's the Mormon Temple
behind me.

59:34.003 --> 59:36.699
To be a Mormon is to believe
some really crazy stuff,

59:36.739 --> 59:40.197
crazy even by the standards
of the big religions.

59:40.243 --> 59:41.733
When you're the new kid
on the block...

59:43.346 --> 59:46.543
Thank you.
That was helpful.

59:46.583 --> 59:48.107
You're the new kid
on the block

59:48.151 --> 59:49.914
and all the good crazy has
already been picked over,

59:49.953 --> 59:52.444
so you kind of have to up the ante.

59:52.488 --> 59:53.921
Oh.

59:53.957 --> 59:55.822
God damn it.

59:55.858 --> 59:58.349
Not while
I'm in the middle of it.

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.798
Well, we do have it.

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:03.924
Boy, a lot of people came

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:05.696
- out of the woodwork.
- Yeah.

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:13.469
So did you guys get anybody
from the church to talk to?

01:00:13.509 --> 01:00:16.171
Well, if you count getting
thrown off the property

01:00:16.212 --> 01:00:19.670
- "talked to."
- That's probably better.

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:22.981
We'd like you
to "Meet the Mormons."

01:00:23.019 --> 01:00:25.385
In the founding scripture,
you open up the Doctrine of Covenants,

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:27.548
you read the autobiography
of Joseph Smith.

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:30.753
He quotes Jesus Christ as telling him

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:33.023
that every other creed
on earth is, quote,

01:00:33.062 --> 01:00:35.189
"an abomination."
An abomination.

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:37.665
I mean, that's not
a very ecumenical statement.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:40.692
You're talking about things that,
I think, at some level

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:43.365
you sense just
do not make sense.

01:00:43.406 --> 01:00:46.569
I'm glad you said that because I read
some of the tenets of Mormonism,

01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:49.772
like " God lives on a planet
near the star of Kalob."

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:51.541
- Kolob.
- Kolob.

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:54.516
God the Father who's a physical man
with a body of flesh and bone

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:58.111
is probably about 6' tall,
lives on a place called Kolob,

01:00:58.154 --> 01:01:01.487
had sexual relations with Mary...
remember he's a man.

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:04.049
"Jesus Christ was conceived
by God the father

01:01:04.093 --> 01:01:06.118
having actual sex with Mary."

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:08.528
Mary said, " If this is what God wants,

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:10.395
I'll be glad to do His will."

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:12.401
"Dark skin is a curse from God,

01:01:12.435 --> 01:01:14.027
but if you're sufficiently righteous,

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:15.230
a dark-skinned person

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:17.535
can become light-skinned."

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:20.007
According to
the Book of Mormon,

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:22.511
after his resurrection,
Jesus came to the Americas

01:01:22.545 --> 01:01:24.479
to preach to the Indians.

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:27.574
"That American Indians are
actually a lost tribe of Israel."

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:28.811
They're lost Jews.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.444
And also the idea

01:01:32.488 --> 01:01:34.979
that Christianity
is American,

01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:37.515
I think, is an amazing
entitlement to a people

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:41.326
who are always trying
to meld God and country.

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:44.697
The Garden of Eden was
in Missouri according to Mormonism.

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:46.599
The new Jerusalem
will be there.

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:48.536
Branson, I'm hoping.

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:51.506
I've also heard that the Mormon Church
baptizes dead people.

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:53.839
You can be baptized
for about 50 people,

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:55.901
100 people that've died.

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:58.675
And so you just get dunked
about 50 to 100 times.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.273
That's baptism for the dead.

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:03.251
Caffeine is evil.
That magic underwear can protect you.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.291
And that you need
a secret password to get into heaven.

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.628
Everyone must stand
at the final judgment

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:19.601
before Joseph Smith,
Jesus and Elohim.

01:02:19.635 --> 01:02:21.102
This isn't an easy religion.

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:24.106
Why do you think it is that
so few people

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.233
do what you have done
and leave the church?

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:28.505
The moment you acknowledge
to yourself that Joseph Smith

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:32.503
did not tell the truth about
his experiences and his achievements,

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:35.381
you just committed
social suicide.

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:37.249
- Family and friends...
- Family and friends.

01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:39.481
...will... you're off the deep end.

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:42.821
Dr. Andrew Newberg,
nice to meet you.

01:02:42.859 --> 01:02:47.091
I've finally met someone
who's studied... neurotheology.

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:49.325
This is getting very close
to something I always say,

01:02:49.365 --> 01:02:52.732
which is that religion is
a neurological disorder.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:55.636
What does the brain look like
when it's hopped up on God?

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:57.832
We see a lot of different colors,
which help us to...

01:02:57.874 --> 01:02:59.637
tell us what
the activity is in the brain

01:02:59.675 --> 01:03:02.576
and what we have found is that
there are some very specific changes

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:05.103
when people are actually
meditating or praying

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:07.582
or even speaking in tongues,
which was our last study.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:10.085
In the name of Jesus,

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:12.747
you've been made whole
by the power of God.

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:14.950
- Speaking in tongues?
- We studied people speaking in tongues.

01:03:14.991 --> 01:03:17.118
They're just babbling,
though, right?

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:22.422
They're not really speaking
in a language they don't know.

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:25.434
It's not an actual language,
but what's...

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.095
Just bullshit, Doc,
come on.

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:28.967
Isn't that something?

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:44.284
I love you.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.653
So you would agree that
even if a billion people

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:50.158
believe something,
it can still be ridiculous?

01:03:50.193 --> 01:03:52.525
- Absolutely.
- But the Jews, I mean, they're...

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:55.326
excuse me, Jewish friends...
but they're as cuckoo as anybody,

01:03:55.364 --> 01:03:57.332
especially the really Orthodox ones.

01:03:57.366 --> 01:04:00.927
You are one of the
few Jewish people in the world

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:02.961
who does not believe
in the state of Israel.

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:04.438
You do not think the state

01:04:04.473 --> 01:04:07.738
- of Israel should exist.
- Correct.

01:04:07.777 --> 01:04:09.870
- Okay.
- God gave us the land of Israel.

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:14.008
On Mount Sinai where we made
this bond with God,

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:16.610
He said, " I'm giving you the land,
but I'm stipulating...

01:04:16.652 --> 01:04:20.053
very clearly stipulating... you must
be on a certain level of holiness."

01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:21.818
You will see it clearly
that we were sent out of the land.

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:23.985
So basically you're saying that

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:26.187
the Jewish people have
not been holy enough

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:28.197
to deserve
the land of Israel.

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:30.096
God understands what is good for us,
what is bad for us...

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:32.327
- First of all...
...what will bring us safety or not.

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:33.357
Let me just finish.

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:35.529
God told us, though,
if you will go against God...

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:37.869
- God manipulates the world...
- Okay, l...

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:39.704
Wait a second.
Let me finish this.

01:04:39.742 --> 01:04:41.767
God said if you're going
to try to make the state,

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:43.870
you will be unsuccessful.

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:45.471
You are looking through...

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:48.449
you're trying to look
at this world through a keyhole.

01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:50.611
I'm looking through the key...

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:52.951
Let me finish.
God is compassionate.

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:54.957
Everything is directly
from God, we believe.

01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:57.926
- But it seems to me...
- I'll now explain what you're asking.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.121
The concept of saying

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:02.722
that we've suffered
enough anti-Semitism...

01:05:02.765 --> 01:05:04.426
Never again.

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:07.630
So you don't say "Never again."
You say "Again."

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:10.639
Yeah. Let us understand
that the Jewish people

01:05:10.673 --> 01:05:12.368
were living in exile
for 2,000 years

01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:14.205
under God's protection

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:16.211
and we were living
in Western civilization...

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:18.338
- Germany, Poland. Not anymore...
- Let me finish.

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:20.315
We were living amongst
all nations throughout the years.

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:22.476
...'cause they're all dead.
How many people died in the Holocaust?

01:05:22.518 --> 01:05:25.919
You're jumping.
Let's jump to the Holocaust.

01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:28.583
I thought the issue
was Jewish safety.

01:05:28.624 --> 01:05:30.751
I thought the issue was
how many Jews are dying.

01:05:30.793 --> 01:05:32.818
So let's talk
about Jewish safety.

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:34.853
Okay, I'm sure there was a few...

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:38.560
A couple million Jews died,
that's okay, that's the wording you use?

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:42.037
You're the one who went
to Iran in December 2006

01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:43.766
for the president

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:47.105
of that country's
Holocaust "denial" conference.

01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:48.974
Whoa, don't just throw words.

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:03.319
Why does Ahmadinejad say
that he wants Israel

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:04.883
- to be wiped from the face of the...
- When did he say that?

01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:06.861
- He did.
- He never said that.

01:06:06.896 --> 01:06:08.454
What did he say?
What was the exact quote?

01:06:08.497 --> 01:06:12.695
- He said it should disappear.
- What, is he David Copperfield?

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:15.966
- That's chutzpah.
- Never again, Rabbi, never again.

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:17.870
Wait. One more second.

01:06:17.907 --> 01:06:20.171
No, I'm out.

01:06:22.211 --> 01:06:24.111
We have Conservatives.
We have Reforms.

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:25.408
We have the Orthodox.

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:28.042
You are an observing Jew.

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:29.949
It says it right there
in the fourth commandment:

01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:32.477
Honor the Sabbath day
to keep it holy.

01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:35.490
Friday night to Saturday night,
you don't do anything.

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:39.551
Yeah, the rabbis over the centuries
have created these prohibitions

01:06:39.595 --> 01:06:42.029
as a way to try
to protect the day of rest.

01:06:42.064 --> 01:06:45.864
You can't use electricity.
You can't drive.

01:06:45.901 --> 01:06:49.496
Let's talk a little about
keeping the Sabbath holy.

01:06:49.538 --> 01:06:52.063
I've always wondered
if it came about

01:06:52.108 --> 01:06:55.168
because God rested
on the Sabbath

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:57.179
and that's why man has to.

01:06:57.213 --> 01:06:59.181
That's right,
and that was the creation

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:01.080
of the seventh day,
that there should be rest.

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:04.553
There are 39 types of specific actions

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:07.078
that cannot be done on the Sabbath.

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:08.715
One of them is lighting a fire.

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:10.487
Planting. Another one is plowing.

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:12.323
Another one is
tying a knot, untying a knot.

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:15.330
One is building, and one is
destroying so as to build.

01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:18.492
So much more kosher is
to develop these gadgets

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:20.934
- that figure out a way around it.
- That's right.

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:23.666
It does seem that you are,
to a degree,

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:25.765
trying to outsmart God.

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:29.107
If the lawmaker never
makes a mistake,

01:07:29.145 --> 01:07:33.013
and still there's a loophole there,
why is that loophole there?

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:35.415
To be used in a situation of need.

01:07:35.451 --> 01:07:37.851
But how did this get updated

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:39.514
for a 4,000-year-old rule?

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:41.420
It seems there's an awful lot

01:07:41.457 --> 01:07:43.118
that has to do with electricity.

01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:45.218
Rabbi Halperin's work here
is translating it

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:47.229
into something more modern.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:52.034
Let's look at some
of the gadgets you have.

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:55.595
I'm particularly interested in
the phone. Is there not a cell phone?

01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:57.401
It's not a cell phone.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.032
Okay, wow.

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:01.771
I have to say,
that looks modern.

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:06.573
Each number is trying
to dial itself all the time.

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:11.451
Hello. Hello.

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:13.148
When I take the stick

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:15.885
- and I put it into the hole...
- Hello.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:18.018
...l'm inhibiting that
which is inhibiting

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:20.926
the number from dialing itself.

01:08:20.962 --> 01:08:23.932
Let me ask about this.
It's obviously a wheelchair.

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:26.093
- May I?
- Sure.

01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:30.971
Oh, wow.

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:33.270
And this is not the new model,
I'm guessing.

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:35.607
- This is the experimental prototype.
- I see.

01:08:35.644 --> 01:08:37.975
Schmuck!

01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:41.642
- This runs on air pressure, right?
- Correct.

01:08:41.684 --> 01:08:43.810
Basically, we've got
150 atmospheres

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:45.821
of pressure here.

01:08:45.854 --> 01:08:48.323
We've got the turning it on,
turning it off here.

01:08:48.357 --> 01:08:50.518
So air is okay.

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:53.493
- Air good. Fire bad.
- Fire bad.

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:55.861
Fire bad!

01:08:55.898 --> 01:08:57.991
We've taken an old bicycle...

01:09:00.368 --> 01:09:02.496
- I forgot what it's called.
- Tire.

01:09:02.537 --> 01:09:05.803
Okay. Air goes in,
air goes out.

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.502
If I was a person
in that wheelchair,

01:09:07.542 --> 01:09:10.603
I might say to myself,
"Why am I going to these lengths

01:09:10.645 --> 01:09:14.138
to please God, who's taken away
my legs to begin with?"

01:09:14.183 --> 01:09:17.515
Okay.

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:19.680
That would be fascinating.
It's an elevator.

01:09:19.721 --> 01:09:21.747
Oh, it's a Shabbatavator.

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:23.849
Let me guess,
you can't push a button...

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:26.417
- Correct.
...on the Sabbath.

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:30.228
The issues behind the scenes that
people don't see are the real problems.

01:09:30.265 --> 01:09:32.564
An even bigger problem might
be how do you get someone

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:36.229
to put this in their building if
they're not completely nuts?

01:09:36.272 --> 01:09:38.796
Well, actually, that really
doesn't make a difference.

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.069
Hmm.

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:42.600
How we define what is
crazy or not crazy

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:47.207
about religions is ultimately up
to how we define crazy.

01:09:47.249 --> 01:09:49.911
If you define mental illness
as anyone who hears a voice

01:09:49.952 --> 01:09:53.388
talking to them, then anyone who has
heard the voice of God is crazy.

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:13.204
She talks about a prophecy

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:16.370
that these children needed to die.

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:20.777
The dispatcher asked
"Why did you do this?"

01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:23.649
"I was told to."
"Who told you?" "God."

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:29.024
There is nothing

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:31.424
He may not ask of thee?

01:10:32.761 --> 01:10:34.820
But in layman's terms,
Jesus was nuts.

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:37.593
Moses..." Stay here,
I'm going up

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:39.726
and getting the 10 Commandments
right from God."

01:10:39.768 --> 01:10:41.827
You know, 'cause one
thing I've also...

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:44.464
We didn't have brain-scan technology
back then, so it's a hard to tell.

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:47.270
I know, but if a guy says he went
up on a mountain and he talked to God,

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:49.334
and He talked to him
through a burning bush,

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:51.312
that guy's a cuckoo.

01:11:09.665 --> 01:11:11.997
All those pastors who refer to me

01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:15.003
as the anti-Christ, false prophet,

01:11:15.037 --> 01:11:17.597
it's because they're miserable.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:21.235
Anyone who doesn't believe
in me is miserable.

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:29.543
- My mike is on?
- Yes, sir.

01:11:29.585 --> 01:11:31.883
Okay, who are you Biblically?

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.653
I am Jesus Christ man,
the second coming of Christ, I am.

01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:38.990
The Old Testament speaks
about me clearly

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:40.689
and the New Testament also.

01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:43.129
- About you personally?
- Yes.

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:46.566
Not just because you have...
you share the name Jesus?

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:49.366
- No, not because of that.
- You also share the name Miranda.

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:51.100
Maybe you're Carmen Miranda.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.131
Maybe the second coming of her?

01:11:53.175 --> 01:11:56.667
You should have fruit on your head,
instead of fruit in your head.

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:00.342
Okay. Fuck you.
How's that?

01:12:00.382 --> 01:12:03.783
Why do you think
God chose you?

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:06.845
Jesus of Nazareth had a wife

01:12:06.889 --> 01:12:09.824
so after they killed him,

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:13.794
his seed kept going,
maybe through France, Spain,

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:17.162
and then from Spain,
came to Puerto Rico.

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:22.334
The bloodline come
from Abraham, Abraham to David,

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:24.032
David to Jesus of Nazareth,

01:12:24.073 --> 01:12:26.701
Jesus of Nazareth, me.

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:29.233
Okay, I though a second coming

01:12:29.278 --> 01:12:32.076
was the reincarnation

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:34.344
of the Christ himself,

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:36.613
not a descendant of.

01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:38.517
No, he's a descendant.

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:41.682
Descendant? Oh... but
you don't believe in hell?

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:43.783
- No.
- Or the Devil?

01:12:43.826 --> 01:12:46.351
- No.
- Or even sin, right?

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:48.659
No, there's not
a sin any longer.

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:52.656
What you teach is that
Jesus died for our sins

01:12:52.701 --> 01:12:56.137
and so there's not really
any sinning anymore.

01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:59.766
- No more sin.
- This is like a diet doctor saying,

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:01.605
- "Eat anything you want."
- Right.

01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:03.907
"You don't lose weight,
but it's easy to stick to."

01:13:03.946 --> 01:13:05.072
That's what I believe, Bill.

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:07.014
Oh, I know you do.

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:09.609
And I have many people
who believe in this.

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:11.619
And yet, you have a little...
you have a little twinkle

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:13.621
in your eye when say it.

01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:16.681
No, I believe in that.
I believe.

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:20.684
How do we know? Because lots
of people would like this job.

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:22.594
How do you get this job
as the second coming?

01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:24.189
It's not on Craigslist.

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:26.793
- Yeah.
- I'm guessing. Maybe it is.

01:13:26.835 --> 01:13:27.961
See, two angels...

01:13:28.003 --> 01:13:30.267
Two guys named Angel,
Spanish guys.

01:13:31.673 --> 01:13:33.368
You know what I'm talking about,

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:35.969
you fucking cockroach!

01:13:36.011 --> 01:13:37.979
- No.
- Oh, actual angels.

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:40.311
- Two angels came to me...
- Okay.

01:13:40.349 --> 01:13:42.613
...and they told me

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:45.142
"The Lord of Lords
and King of Kings

01:13:45.187 --> 01:13:48.088
is coming to anoint you
for the ministry tonight."

01:13:48.123 --> 01:13:50.717
What form did the angels come in?
How tall?

01:13:50.759 --> 01:13:52.750
Little tall and strong.

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:54.592
Whatever they told me,
I obey.

01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:56.723
I don't wanna mess
with them.

01:13:56.765 --> 01:13:58.289
But I'm just saying,

01:13:58.333 --> 01:14:00.927
it seems that if God wanted

01:14:00.969 --> 01:14:03.267
to communicate something
to the world...

01:14:03.305 --> 01:14:05.432
He's all powerful...

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:08.568
He would just talk
to the whole world.

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:11.977
It always seems
He picks out a prophet in private

01:14:12.014 --> 01:14:14.949
and tells them,
"Okay, you're the prophet."

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:17.645
- I am.
- "You go tell the rest of the world."

01:14:17.686 --> 01:14:19.415
So we just sort of
have to take it on faith.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:21.650
We just sort of
have to believe you.

01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:23.817
Right, yeah, it's true.

01:14:26.862 --> 01:14:29.854
Abraham. Noah.

01:14:29.898 --> 01:14:32.423
Lord, what shall I do?

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:33.958
Moses,

01:14:34.002 --> 01:14:36.527
climb the mount alone.

01:14:36.572 --> 01:14:39.507
Once again, the Lord had
spoken to Joseph Smith

01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:41.941
as he had to Adam, Abraham,

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:45.708
Moses, Paul and others.

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:47.772
I am the first Christian.

01:14:47.816 --> 01:14:51.445
And the rest are really
kind of Jewish, you're saying,

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:53.512
because they're following a Jew.

01:14:53.555 --> 01:14:55.182
That's it.

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:57.192
In fact, they put on the plates...

01:14:57.226 --> 01:15:00.093
they say " My boss is
a Jewish carpenter."

01:15:00.128 --> 01:15:03.620
How ridiculous is that?
A Jewish carpenter!

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:06.133
- Imagine.
- Come on, Jews hire carpenters.

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:07.795
They don't...

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:11.135
you know, people say
"I found my calling in life."

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:13.403
And it's a good calling.
It's a nice living.

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:15.808
People adore you.
Everywhere you go,

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:18.677
they treat you like Christ,
like you're the Messiah.

01:15:18.714 --> 01:15:22.115
You know, if I discovered
that I was Satan in person,

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:24.015
I would do a good job, too,

01:15:24.052 --> 01:15:26.520
because I would be
faithful to my calling.

01:15:26.555 --> 01:15:28.819
It's how you do
your work, isn't it?

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:30.791
You know, at the end of the day,
whether you're the Messiah

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:33.294
or you're Satan,
it's loving what you do

01:15:33.328 --> 01:15:35.091
and giving it 100%.

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:37.064
I give 100%.

01:15:37.099 --> 01:15:40.830
I wasn't born skeptical.

01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:43.997
I was still making deals
with "God" when I was 40.

01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:45.939
I remember I quit smoking.

01:15:45.974 --> 01:15:48.374
There was some shitty problem
I had in my life,

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:50.173
and I made
a deal with God,

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:52.237
"Okay, if you make
this problem go away,

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:55.148
I will quit smoking,
and I won't go back on it

01:15:55.183 --> 01:15:57.913
'cause I'd know I'd be going back
on a deal with God."

01:15:57.953 --> 01:15:59.750
And you know, I gotta say,

01:15:59.788 --> 01:16:02.382
I'm kind of glad I had "God"

01:16:02.424 --> 01:16:04.119
in my life.

01:16:04.159 --> 01:16:06.627
You are the head

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:11.065
of the First Universal Church
of Cantheism...

01:16:11.099 --> 01:16:13.693
- Yes.
...which is really built around

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:16.465
- this substance here.
- No.

01:16:16.505 --> 01:16:19.633
No? Okay, I got that wrong.

01:16:19.675 --> 01:16:21.700
But it's built
around smoking this.

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:24.041
I mean, it has no dogma, right?

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:25.706
You're not preaching to anybody.
You're not saying

01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:28.477
- you'll save their souls, no rituals.
- No.

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:30.542
How does this differ
from just getting wasted?

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:32.713
I mean that
in the best possible way, but...

01:16:32.754 --> 01:16:34.949
I understand
the concept of God,

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:38.153
a feeling of one
with everything else.

01:16:38.193 --> 01:16:40.787
Do you feel that
every time you smoke pot?

01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:42.956
No.

01:16:42.998 --> 01:16:45.330
Phew! I thought it was just me.

01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:48.962
So why do you think
it's this family of drugs

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:52.098
that's so good
for opening our minds

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:54.074
as opposed to ludes, PCP,

01:16:54.109 --> 01:16:57.545
or smashing up your mother's diet pills
and smoking 'em in a pipe?

01:16:59.181 --> 01:17:01.376
I don't know.
I don't know.

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.584
So I did want
to get your thoughts

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:10.217
about what's going on in this city.
This is your city.

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:13.159
There's a lot
of controversy with...

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:15.322
maybe the Dutch
are so tolerant

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:18.299
that they're now
tolerating intolerance.

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:20.927
There's a lot of tension
with the Muslim community.

01:17:20.969 --> 01:17:24.132
It's all religious fundamentalists.

01:17:24.172 --> 01:17:26.572
They already killed
Theo Van Gogh,

01:17:26.608 --> 01:17:29.702
who was a known
television maker.

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:33.272
This is the spot
where Theo Van Gogh

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:36.216
- was assassinated?
- This is exactly the spot.

01:17:36.251 --> 01:17:38.776
He was a Dutch filmmaker.
He made a 10-minute film.

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:42.586
It was deeply offensive
to Muslims.

01:17:42.624 --> 01:17:45.923
Oh, Allah, you say
that men are the protectors

01:17:45.961 --> 01:17:47.861
and maintainers of women

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:50.660
because you have given
the one more strength than the other.

01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:52.428
I feel at least once a week,

01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:55.061
the strength of my husband's fist

01:17:55.103 --> 01:17:56.832
on my face.

01:17:56.872 --> 01:17:59.363
Lots of people think
that free speech

01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:04.175
goes right up to this point and then
when you're talking about religion,

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:07.704
when you're talking
about the Prophet, all bets are off.

01:18:07.749 --> 01:18:09.842
It goes both ways,
freedom of speech.

01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:12.445
It goes both ways,
but the people who actually...

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:16.321
usually do the killing for it
wind up on the Muslim side.

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:19.350
Do you think that says something
about the different cultures?

01:18:19.394 --> 01:18:21.828
I don't want to have
the image of the Muslims,

01:18:21.863 --> 01:18:23.524
you know, if they don't like
something you say,

01:18:23.565 --> 01:18:25.032
they kill you, because it's not.

01:18:26.601 --> 01:18:30.367
It was a noisy crowd outside
the Danish embassy in London

01:18:30.405 --> 01:18:34.102
as speakers condemned the cartoons
portraying the Prophet Mohammed.

01:18:34.142 --> 01:18:37.634
I wish I could get
your music in America,

01:18:37.679 --> 01:18:41.843
but considering how controversial
it's been here in England...

01:18:47.289 --> 01:18:49.154
Initially, when I did the record,

01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:51.386
a lot of people supported it,

01:18:51.426 --> 01:18:54.589
but then,
in the current times that we're in,

01:18:54.629 --> 01:18:56.119
people got really scared.

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:58.655
It just shows
the stupidity of society,

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:02.101
which refuses
to discuss,

01:19:02.137 --> 01:19:05.072
debate things
in an intelligent way.

01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:06.631
And I don't except that.

01:19:06.675 --> 01:19:08.540
I just put my middle finger up.

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:10.943
One of your big gripes...
and it's a valid one...

01:19:10.979 --> 01:19:14.346
you keep saying that...
in fact, let me read your quote.

01:19:14.382 --> 01:19:16.350
You said, " Anyone worried
about what I'm saying

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:20.115
should get involved in the debate.
You are allowed to dissent.

01:19:20.155 --> 01:19:22.419
- That is a right."
- Yeah.

01:19:22.457 --> 01:19:26.052
But is that a right
in Islam, to dissent?

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:28.187
Of course it is. Why do you think
there's so many schools of thought?

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:31.961
- Why do you think there's...
- It wasn't a right for Salman Rushdie.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.968
The demonstrators set off
from Hyde Park,

01:19:34.002 --> 01:19:36.664
bringing much
of central London to a standstill.

01:19:36.705 --> 01:19:39.902
Their hatred focused
on Salman Rushdie and his book.

01:19:39.941 --> 01:19:42.774
The mullahs pressed home
their message in thousands of mosques...

01:19:42.811 --> 01:19:44.802
Salman Rushdie must be killed.

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:47.542
See, Salman Rushdie
was there to provoke,

01:19:47.582 --> 01:19:50.380
insult, and he did it
intentionally, right?

01:19:50.418 --> 01:19:52.079
But should you die
for that?

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.452
No no, well, I mean,
like, that was...

01:19:54.489 --> 01:19:56.184
you know, it's easy
for you to say

01:19:56.224 --> 01:19:58.317
things are kind of
in black and white.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.726
They're more complex than that.

01:20:00.762 --> 01:20:02.957
There's emotions and passions

01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:04.989
and philosophy involved

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:07.627
- and all that stuff.
- You know, all you gotta say is

01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:11.161
it's wrong for someone
to have to suffer a death threat

01:20:11.206 --> 01:20:13.731
- for writing a book.
- Well, hang on.

01:20:13.775 --> 01:20:15.265
But apparently, it's more
complicated than that.

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:18.040
Well, it is because...
but I mean, Western...

01:20:18.079 --> 01:20:20.479
We'll never see
eye to eye there,

01:20:20.515 --> 01:20:22.847
but you want that
protection for yourself.

01:20:22.884 --> 01:20:24.852
No, I think
these debates are a lot...

01:20:24.886 --> 01:20:28.720
I'm willing to discuss 'em
in terms of facts and not fictions.

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:30.281
When you disagree with me,
it's a fiction.

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:32.190
- No no.
- You have the truth

01:20:32.227 --> 01:20:33.717
- and I have the fiction.
- No, I don't have the truth.

01:20:33.762 --> 01:20:35.627
But you don't see that
there's a fundamental hypocrisy

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:37.757
of you asking
for the right to dissent

01:20:37.799 --> 01:20:39.892
and somebody else
getting a death threat?

01:20:39.935 --> 01:20:43.234
No no, 'cause my dissent is
to stop the madness.

01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:50.668
I'm here with Geert Wilders
here in The Hague,

01:20:50.712 --> 01:20:52.339
which of course is
home to the World Court,

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:54.177
but also to the Dutch Parliament.

01:20:54.216 --> 01:20:57.344
You are taking
a kind of hard line here

01:20:57.385 --> 01:20:59.080
in the Netherlands.

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:02.419
Islam is, according to me,
a violent religion.

01:21:02.457 --> 01:21:04.425
The Koran is a violent book

01:21:04.459 --> 01:21:06.427
and Mohammed was
a violent prophet.

01:21:06.461 --> 01:21:08.929
Do you think Islam wants
to take over the world?

01:21:08.964 --> 01:21:11.125
- They don't even make...
- Right right.

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:12.861
...a secret about it.

01:21:12.901 --> 01:21:14.425
We are infidels.

01:21:14.469 --> 01:21:17.700
I mean, we should either become
Islamic or we should be killed.

01:21:17.739 --> 01:21:19.832
This is what they say.
This is what they are proud of.

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:22.207
Okay, we're here at Habibi Ana.

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:24.269
- Did I say that right?
- Yeah.

01:21:24.312 --> 01:21:26.246
You guys, really...
I mean,

01:21:26.281 --> 01:21:28.215
gay Muslim activists,

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:31.777
that is a very rare job description.
You guys have balls.

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:35.150
How big is
the gay community...

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:38.387
the gay Muslim community
here in Amsterdam?

01:21:38.426 --> 01:21:40.724
Or is this it?

01:21:40.762 --> 01:21:44.721
I mean, I'm guessing,
Thursday isn't...

01:21:44.766 --> 01:21:47.462
isn't gay night here.

01:21:47.502 --> 01:21:50.062
I hope you guys find
each other attractive,

01:21:50.105 --> 01:21:52.198
'cause otherwise...

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.639
you don't feel afraid?

01:21:53.675 --> 01:21:55.074
Here in Holland I'm not,

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:57.578
but when I came from my country,
I was very afraid.

01:21:57.612 --> 01:21:58.909
There was an article of law:

01:21:58.947 --> 01:22:01.108
Punish the gay
for one year just because he's gay.

01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:03.709
- Just being gay can get you a year.
- Just being gay.

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.310
Same as Alabama.

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:09.553
What I learned is that
they're not really...

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:12.219
they're not specific
against homosexuality.

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:14.820
They're not specific against,
in other words,

01:22:14.863 --> 01:22:17.297
the desire
of a man for a man.

01:22:17.332 --> 01:22:20.824
What they are against
is specific behavior,

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:22.632
like anal sex.

01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:26.767
They don't say homosexuality,
heterosexuality.

01:22:26.808 --> 01:22:29.606
They just don't want you doing it
in the naughty place,

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:31.202
which I guess,

01:22:31.246 --> 01:22:33.942
if you put that out
of the picture in homosexuality,

01:22:33.982 --> 01:22:37.474
what do you have left?
Just the blowjob.

01:22:39.354 --> 01:22:40.912
What do you think
when people say

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:43.220
it affects your memory,

01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:45.453
especially your
short-term memory?

01:22:45.493 --> 01:22:48.690
- It does.
- And what do you think when people say

01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:52.166
that it affects your memory,
your short-term memory?

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:53.997
It does.

01:22:56.338 --> 01:22:59.796
- I like my hat.
- It's good. You look good, too.

01:22:59.841 --> 01:23:01.968
I think I do.
I think I might adopt this look.

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:02.999
Yes.

01:23:03.044 --> 01:23:05.274
Is there a reason
why you have a black hat

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:06.837
and I have a white hat?

01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:09.213
We have any color you like.

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:12.219
So I bought this.
I like it myself

01:23:12.253 --> 01:23:14.448
because I like the color.

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:18.289
There is a lot of tension
in the last five years or so.

01:23:18.326 --> 01:23:22.319
Is Islam a threat
to Dutch values?

01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:24.855
Islam is preaching,

01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:26.890
above all, peace.

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:29.165
Peace, peace and peace.

01:23:51.459 --> 01:23:53.859
The name Islam means peace.

01:23:53.895 --> 01:23:56.193
And yet it is involved
in a lot of war and violence.

01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:58.096
Yeah, it's just all politics.

01:23:58.133 --> 01:23:59.998
- Nothing to do with religion?
- No no.

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:01.662
- No?
- No, sir.

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:03.671
- It's political.
- It's politics.

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:05.502
Seems to be
a lot of passages

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:07.940
that say the infidel

01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:11.275
is not the equal
of the believer.

01:24:11.312 --> 01:24:13.371
The infidel will die in hell.

01:24:13.415 --> 01:24:16.384
Don't feel bad
about hating the infidel.

01:24:16.418 --> 01:24:19.546
- No.
- No?

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:21.578
Boy, I've got
bad information.

01:24:21.623 --> 01:24:22.885
Yes, you have.
I think so.

01:24:22.924 --> 01:24:25.518
- No no no no no.
- No no no no.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.118
- No no no no.
- No.

01:24:27.162 --> 01:24:29.790
No? No. I'm wrong
about everything.

01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:33.562
The way I perceive things in the Koran
is not about killing infidels.

01:24:33.601 --> 01:24:36.365
- But you have read it in there?
- Of course I've read the Koran.

01:24:36.404 --> 01:24:39.237
You've read those passages, and what
did you think when you read them?

01:24:39.274 --> 01:24:41.799
No, but I explain those
passages within the time

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:43.936
in which they emerged
in the world.

01:24:43.978 --> 01:24:45.468
That's not how people
read holy books.

01:24:45.513 --> 01:24:47.105
People don't read
holy books and go,

01:24:47.148 --> 01:24:49.810
"Well, that was good for then."
People who read holy books and go,

01:24:49.851 --> 01:24:52.012
"This is the word of God.
It's forever!"

01:24:52.053 --> 01:24:54.954
- No, I don't agree.
- That's how most people do it.

01:24:54.989 --> 01:24:57.583
I just don't buy it
that these guys are

01:24:57.625 --> 01:24:59.889
in this state of denial.

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:02.624
I think they're just
in a state of denial

01:25:02.664 --> 01:25:04.655
to an outsider.

01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:07.429
They will not admit
anything is wrong

01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:10.165
with their culture
to an outsider.

01:25:10.205 --> 01:25:12.298
Muslims were imperialists

01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:15.070
in the century
after Mohammed's death.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:17.772
They conquered most
of the known world

01:25:17.812 --> 01:25:19.507
in one century.

01:25:19.547 --> 01:25:22.482
Yeah, it is possible.

01:25:22.517 --> 01:25:24.417
You call it conquer.

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:26.181
I think they were trying

01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:29.190
to spread Islam.

01:25:29.224 --> 01:25:32.819
Well, they were, but they weren't doing
it by singing "Kumbaya."

01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:34.795
Excuse me.

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:37.659
Sorry.

01:25:37.699 --> 01:25:40.691
Oh, that 21st century's
always busting in.

01:25:42.737 --> 01:25:44.762
I'm going to shut it off.

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:48.765
I love it that he's got "Kashmir"
as his ringtone.

01:25:53.515 --> 01:25:55.506
Okay, I shut it off.

01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:57.848
- Sorry, I was...
- Yeah...

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:00.910
Politics, okay.

01:26:03.658 --> 01:26:06.650
Do you think it's possible
that when we're on something

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:08.525
like marijuana
or mushrooms

01:26:08.563 --> 01:26:11.623
and believe we're having a very
spiritual experience,

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:14.191
that we're just high?

01:26:14.235 --> 01:26:17.329
- It's... it's...
- Oh, look out your head's on fire!

01:26:17.372 --> 01:26:19.567
Boy, talk about
the light bulb going off,

01:26:19.607 --> 01:26:23.065
- that was your whole head.
- I don't like candles behind me.

01:26:23.111 --> 01:26:26.308
No. Oh, look,
I found another joint.

01:26:26.347 --> 01:26:28.338
Uh-oh.

01:26:29.784 --> 01:26:32.218
Can we get closer?

01:26:32.253 --> 01:26:35.381
That is one hell of a wall.

01:26:51.606 --> 01:26:52.971
This is the Dome of the Rock?

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:56.101
This is the Dome of the Rock.
According to Islam...

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:02.747
On a horse?

01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:10.983
He went to heaven on the horse?

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.459
Why is it holy for the Jews?

01:27:37.752 --> 01:27:40.186
A rock. The Kaaba?

01:27:40.221 --> 01:27:41.882
Isn't that...

01:27:44.158 --> 01:27:45.682
Stone, rock, the same thing.

01:27:47.295 --> 01:27:49.388
Why is that holy?

01:27:52.467 --> 01:27:53.491
Paradise.

01:27:53.534 --> 01:27:57.265
Could the rock itself have been
what we know now to be like a meteor?

01:28:00.842 --> 01:28:03.470
But does it make a difference
that we now understand

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:04.978
what a meteor is?

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:07.305
Yes, right.

01:28:07.348 --> 01:28:08.975
Okay.

01:28:09.017 --> 01:28:10.985
This is the Mount
of Olives.

01:28:11.019 --> 01:28:14.250
A lot of Orthodox Jews want
to be buried here,

01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:16.689
'cause they believe that
when the Messiah comes,

01:28:16.724 --> 01:28:18.817
he will raise them from
the dead and march them through

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:22.125
that golden gate
and onto the Temple Mount,

01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:25.792
which is why the Muslims
have walled up the gate.

01:28:25.833 --> 01:28:28.267
The better to keep out
the Jewish Messiah

01:28:28.303 --> 01:28:30.703
and his kosher zombies
from getting in.

01:28:30.738 --> 01:28:34.640
Although you'd think that
if you had the power to raise the dead,

01:28:34.676 --> 01:28:36.974
you'd have the power
to jump a fence.

01:28:39.247 --> 01:28:40.874
I thought I would not be allowed

01:28:40.915 --> 01:28:43.475
to walk in a mosque.

01:28:43.518 --> 01:28:44.985
I thought only someone of your faith

01:28:45.019 --> 01:28:46.748
was allowed to do that.

01:29:01.402 --> 01:29:03.427
Why is he angry?

01:29:05.073 --> 01:29:06.665
They're angry that
you're talking to me?

01:29:13.381 --> 01:29:16.043
Women in your culture

01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:18.552
seem not to be as equal

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:20.952
to the man as they
are in our culture.

01:29:22.890 --> 01:29:24.050
Yes.

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:28.294
I talked to a Muslim scholar today.

01:29:28.329 --> 01:29:32.425
And he said that Mohammed
had a meeting here.

01:29:40.775 --> 01:29:44.040
Mohammed never set his foot

01:29:44.078 --> 01:29:47.411
on that Temple Mount,
not even one foot.

01:29:47.448 --> 01:29:50.076
Never ever.

01:29:50.118 --> 01:29:53.713
He was never in the land
of Israel, that's a historical fact.

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:06.765
I think even
I understand that.

01:30:06.801 --> 01:30:10.532
Why can't the people
of the different faiths get along?

01:30:10.571 --> 01:30:14.530
All three religions
consider the same site

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:16.566
to be holy.

01:30:18.413 --> 01:30:20.904
Is it not because it was
conquered many times?

01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:24.941
- Yes.
- It was conquered first by King David,

01:30:24.986 --> 01:30:26.954
and then later by
the armies coming out

01:30:26.988 --> 01:30:29.821
of the Arabian Desert.

01:30:29.857 --> 01:30:31.552
- It changed hands during the crusades.
- We had the Romans.

01:30:31.592 --> 01:30:33.150
We had the Byzantines.
We had the Persians.

01:30:36.964 --> 01:30:39.728
There's more than
one mosque in the world

01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:42.668
that used to be a church,
and before that was a temple.

01:30:42.703 --> 01:30:46.139
Because it's a lot easier
just to change the sign on the top

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:47.607
and say
"under new management"

01:30:47.642 --> 01:30:50.236
than it is to change
the whole building.

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:52.246
I worked a lot
of comedy clubs in the '80s

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:55.147
that still had
the disco ball on the ceiling.

01:30:55.183 --> 01:30:57.651
And in the '90s,
they became strip clubs

01:30:57.685 --> 01:31:00.279
and now
they're a Starbucks.

01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:04.280
I've come today to the village
of Cerne Abbas in Southern England

01:31:04.325 --> 01:31:07.783
to show you something
completely different.

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:10.764
It's in the shape
of a giant naked man

01:31:10.798 --> 01:31:14.097
with a sizable erection...
well, sizable for England.

01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:15.625
Some people think
that this means

01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:18.798
that there is a giant actually
buried under that hill.

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.808
Others think it has something
to do with crop circles

01:31:20.842 --> 01:31:23.902
or ancient space visitors
or Druids,

01:31:23.945 --> 01:31:25.913
but nobody really knows.

01:31:25.947 --> 01:31:28.438
And that's what
I find fascinating about this,

01:31:28.483 --> 01:31:31.111
is that it doesn't
really mean anything.

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:33.950
The locals have been
maintaining it for centuries,

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:36.013
and they don't
really know why.

01:31:36.057 --> 01:31:38.082
They just do it because
they've always done it,

01:31:38.125 --> 01:31:40.320
and isn't that
religion for you?

01:31:40.361 --> 01:31:43.660
Sometimes you kneel,
sometimes you fast

01:31:43.698 --> 01:31:45.757
and sometimes
you go up on the hill

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:48.860
and you cut the grass
around the giant space penis.

01:31:48.903 --> 01:31:51.030
Do you believe,
as so many Christians do nowadays,

01:31:51.072 --> 01:31:53.040
that the world will end?

01:31:53.074 --> 01:31:56.066
I think we are in the end times.
There are many many signs.

01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:58.510
The world as we know it
will come to an end.

01:31:58.546 --> 01:32:00.013
And beyond that,

01:32:00.047 --> 01:32:03.346
there will be the glorious
second coming of Jesus Christ.

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.848
It seems peaceful,

01:32:08.890 --> 01:32:12.121
but this is the very spot where
a lot of Christians believe

01:32:12.159 --> 01:32:13.854
life on earth will end.

01:32:13.895 --> 01:32:16.329
The irony of religion
is that because

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:19.060
of its power to divert man

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:21.466
to destructive courses,

01:32:21.502 --> 01:32:24.596
the world actually
could come to an end.

01:32:24.639 --> 01:32:27.233
A lot of people
in this country believe

01:32:27.275 --> 01:32:28.674
in end times.

01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:31.337
There will be this great
reckoning, the Rapture.

01:32:31.379 --> 01:32:34.109
- Do you believe that?
- I do.

01:32:41.155 --> 01:32:43.715
But if you believe that the world is
gonna come to an end,

01:32:43.758 --> 01:32:45.726
and perhaps any day now,

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:48.422
does it not drain
one's motivation

01:32:48.462 --> 01:32:50.896
to improve life on earth
while we're here?

01:33:01.943 --> 01:33:04.605
The plain fact is,
religion must die

01:33:04.645 --> 01:33:06.806
for mankind to live.

01:33:06.847 --> 01:33:09.782
The hour is getting very late
to be able to indulge

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:13.446
in having key decisions made
by religious people,

01:33:13.487 --> 01:33:16.615
by irrationalists, by those
who would steer the ship of state

01:33:16.657 --> 01:33:19.626
not by a compass,
but by the equivalent

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:22.060
of reading the entrails
of a chicken.

01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:24.428
George Bush prayed
a lot about Iraq,

01:33:24.465 --> 01:33:26.296
but he didn't learn
a lot about it.

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:27.801
I don't know that much
about politics,

01:33:27.835 --> 01:33:29.427
I'll vote for President Bush
because of his faith.

01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:33.736
Faith means making
a virtue out of not thinking.

01:33:33.774 --> 01:33:35.401
It's nothing to brag about.

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:38.276
And those who preach faith
and enable and elevate it

01:33:38.312 --> 01:33:40.940
are our intellectual slaveholders,

01:33:40.982 --> 01:33:43.280
keeping mankind in a bondage

01:33:43.317 --> 01:33:45.308
to fantasy and nonsense

01:33:45.353 --> 01:33:47.150
that has spawned and justified

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:50.316
so much lunacy and destruction.

01:33:50.358 --> 01:33:53.657
Religion is dangerous
because it allows human beings

01:33:53.694 --> 01:33:55.161
who don't have all the answers

01:33:55.196 --> 01:33:57.255
to think that they do.

01:33:57.298 --> 01:33:59.266
Most people would think
it's wonderful when someone says,

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:02.497
"I'm willing, Lord.
I'll do whatever You want me to do."

01:34:02.536 --> 01:34:06.632
Except that since there
are no gods actually talking to us,

01:34:06.674 --> 01:34:10.303
that void is filled in by people
with their own corruptions,

01:34:10.344 --> 01:34:13.836
- limitations and agendas.
- It's going to happen,

01:34:13.881 --> 01:34:15.906
and I'm not saying
necessarily nuclear...

01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:17.315
The Lord didn't say nuclear...

01:34:17.351 --> 01:34:19.512
but I do believe it'll
be something like that.

01:34:19.553 --> 01:34:21.282
And anyone who tells you
they know...

01:34:21.322 --> 01:34:24.314
they just know
what happens when you die,

01:34:24.358 --> 01:34:26.258
I promise you, you don't.

01:34:26.293 --> 01:34:29.626
How can I be so sure?
Because I don't know,

01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:32.861
and you do not possess
mental powers that I do not.

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:35.494
The only appropriate attitude
for man to have

01:34:35.536 --> 01:34:38.004
about the big questions

01:34:38.039 --> 01:34:40.405
is not the arrogant certitude

01:34:40.441 --> 01:34:42.466
that is the hallmark of religion,

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:45.479
but doubt. Doubt is humble,

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:47.344
and that's what
man needs to be,

01:34:47.381 --> 01:34:51.044
considering that human history
is just a litany

01:34:51.085 --> 01:34:54.077
of getting shit dead wrong.

01:34:54.121 --> 01:34:56.589
Jesus is coming back
to rescue the Jews,

01:34:56.624 --> 01:34:59.024
because he is
the only one that can.

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:01.528
The believer goes in the paradise.

01:35:01.562 --> 01:35:04.895
Unbeliever, they will go to hell.

01:35:04.932 --> 01:35:08.265
The Jews are the only reason
that I am a Christian.

01:35:08.302 --> 01:35:10.395
- I love them.
- But you're not gonna take them

01:35:10.438 --> 01:35:13.032
- to heaven with you, are you?
- I'm gonna go in the Rapture,

01:35:13.074 --> 01:35:15.872
and I'm gonna come back
on a white horse.

01:35:26.053 --> 01:35:29.079
So you think Jesus
will end this earth at some point,

01:35:29.123 --> 01:35:30.750
maybe in your lifetime?

01:35:30.791 --> 01:35:32.759
One always hopes.
This is a sign, and that is a sign.

01:35:32.793 --> 01:35:34.886
If a nuclear bomb went off,

01:35:34.929 --> 01:35:37.762
and it seemed like that was
exactly what it had said,

01:35:37.798 --> 01:35:40.266
balls of fire or something,

01:35:40.301 --> 01:35:42.235
you wouldn't look on that
as necessarily a bad thing.

01:35:42.269 --> 01:35:43.896
I know I'll be with God.

01:35:43.938 --> 01:35:45.906
This is why rational people,

01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:47.567
anti-religionists,

01:35:47.608 --> 01:35:49.576
must end their timidity
and come out of the closet

01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:51.407
and assert themselves.

01:35:51.445 --> 01:35:54.642
And those who consider themselves
only moderately religious

01:35:54.682 --> 01:35:56.741
really need to look
in the mirror and realize

01:35:56.784 --> 01:35:59.378
that the solace and comfort
that religion brings you

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:02.218
actually comes
at a terrible price.

01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:05.282
It says in the last days
there'll be wars, rumors of wars.

01:36:05.326 --> 01:36:07.556
The Bible prophesies
from the Book of Revelation...

01:36:07.595 --> 01:36:09.586
they're going to be fulfilled!

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:11.598
Can this be accomplished
without violence?

01:36:11.632 --> 01:36:14.795
- No.
- Islam ruling the world,

01:36:14.835 --> 01:36:16.132
global jihad.

01:36:16.170 --> 01:36:17.762
- Who will win out?
- We'll win.

01:36:17.805 --> 01:36:20.069
That's for God to decide
on Judgment Day.

01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:33.181
If you belonged to a political
party or a social club

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:36.587
that was tied
to as much bigotry, misogyny,

01:36:36.624 --> 01:36:38.353
homophobia, violence

01:36:38.392 --> 01:36:40.622
and sheer ignorance
as religion is,

01:36:40.661 --> 01:36:42.219
you'd resign in protest.

01:36:42.263 --> 01:36:44.697
To do otherwise is
to be an enabler,

01:36:44.732 --> 01:36:46.529
a Mafia wife,

01:36:46.567 --> 01:36:49.297
with the true devils of extremism

01:36:49.336 --> 01:36:50.769
that draw their legitimacy

01:36:50.805 --> 01:36:53.171
from the billions
of their fellow travelers.

01:36:53.207 --> 01:36:56.870
If the world does come
to an end here or wherever,

01:36:56.911 --> 01:37:00.005
or if it limps into the future,
decimated by the effects

01:37:00.047 --> 01:37:03.107
of a religion-inspired
nuclear terrorism,

01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:05.311
let's remember
what the real problem was:

01:37:05.352 --> 01:37:08.480
That we learned how
to precipitate mass death

01:37:08.522 --> 01:37:11.355
before we got past
the neurological disorder

01:37:11.392 --> 01:37:13.758
of wishing for it.

01:37:13.794 --> 01:37:17.525
That's it. Grow up or die.

01:37:19.834 --> 01:37:23.793
We are in a conflict
between good and evil.

01:40:45.873 --> 01:40:48.433
See you in heaven.

01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:50.102
Who knows?

01:40:51.512 --> 01:40:53.480
Yeah, exactly.

01:40:58.481 --> 01:40:59.481
