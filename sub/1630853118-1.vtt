WEBVTT

03:08.781 --> 03:10.016
I just don't get it.

03:11.050 --> 03:12.919
Why are you
always this difficult?

03:13.552 --> 03:15.587
Why don't you guys ever shut up?

03:18.658 --> 03:20.525
So everything will be fine.

03:21.794 --> 03:25.031
Zaphoid b. Esquire will make the
final ratification toward contracts.

03:25.832 --> 03:29.669
- He's already temporarily ratified.
- Yeah, two fucking years ago.

03:29.769 --> 03:31.904
Dear. I don't
appreciate that language.

03:32.004 --> 03:34.941
Yeah. Well, mom, I don't
appreciate dad's blind optimism.

03:39.712 --> 03:43.049
- Oh, sorry, mom, I didn't mean...
- I know.

03:43.149 --> 03:44.416
Son...

03:47.854 --> 03:51.891
I just don't want you to always see
the bad in everything. I promise,

03:51.991 --> 03:54.492
- everything will be fine.
- Yeah, what good is a promise

03:54.593 --> 03:55.594
you can't deliver on?

03:56.729 --> 03:59.665
Garp, dad. I can hear you
through the music sniggle.

03:59.765 --> 04:01.566
Can you guys
please keep it down?

04:01.667 --> 04:02.902
Whatever, augustine.

04:04.170 --> 04:07.372
Helmholtz, come sit back down. I
may not be able to see anymore,

04:07.472 --> 04:10.009
but I can still sense when
you're trying to console our son.

04:10.109 --> 04:12.144
We all know
that it fucks with him.

04:15.447 --> 04:16.448
I'm sorry, mom.

04:18.851 --> 04:19.886
We are all sorry.

04:22.755 --> 04:26.959
<i>Your esquires will arrive in five minutes.</i>

04:27.059 --> 04:29.695
<i>Enter your beds
or be in breach of contract.</i>

04:30.696 --> 04:31.797
<i>Thank you.</i>

04:49.614 --> 04:53.686
<i>Your esquires will arrive in five,</i>

04:53.786 --> 04:57.489
<i>four, three, two, one.</i>

05:33.993 --> 05:35.527
You know the drill, boss.

05:36.662 --> 05:38.530
Feeding instructions
on page four.

05:38.631 --> 05:41.167
- Subsection d of each contract.
- Yes.

06:07.960 --> 06:08.961
Good.

06:20.272 --> 06:21.272
Good.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.184
Good.

06:47.033 --> 06:49.068
Malfunction again.

06:50.770 --> 06:51.770
Again?

07:08.687 --> 07:10.689
This is a new one. No battery.

07:14.126 --> 07:15.828
So it should not
malfunction again.

08:07.346 --> 08:10.216
No grooming
or extras for me today?

08:11.750 --> 08:14.220
You get your purchase next month.

08:46.185 --> 08:49.054
- What are you doing?
- Just speeding things up a bit, helping.

08:49.155 --> 08:51.867
- That is not part of your contractual obligation.
- Yeah. Chill out!

08:51.891 --> 08:53.792
- I'm just helping.
- Your contract explicitly

08:53.893 --> 08:56.829
obligates a caregiving
esquire to nourish you.

08:57.930 --> 09:00.833
I order you to cease and desist.

09:04.003 --> 09:06.672
- Cease and desist!
- Yeah...

09:06.772 --> 09:11.810
- Cease and desist now! Now! Go on!
- Oh, shit. I desist.

09:11.911 --> 09:15.247
- Desist!
- I desist. I'm desisting. I desist.

09:21.921 --> 09:22.922
Very well.

09:24.356 --> 09:28.694
Do not attempt to breach your contract
after I warned you, ever again,

09:28.794 --> 09:30.396
I will not be so lenient.

09:32.264 --> 09:36.068
You know the penalty for breach,
any breach, is death.

09:47.913 --> 09:50.115
Are they going to ratify
our contract sooner?

09:50.216 --> 09:52.418
Or is your stupid ass
u. Of u.E. Going to keep it

09:52.518 --> 09:54.787
so I get killed
for leaving my house?

09:54.887 --> 09:59.491
The union of united esquires
protects me and you,

09:59.592 --> 10:01.794
so watch it.

10:01.894 --> 10:04.496
Yeah, how exactly
do you protect me?

10:05.231 --> 10:08.767
We make sure everyone's
contract is fulfilled

10:08.867 --> 10:11.904
so the world is a safe
and stable place for us all.

10:12.004 --> 10:15.341
My contract says
I can't leave my house.

10:16.475 --> 10:19.511
- You signed it.
- Yeah, but I was never supposed to wake up.

10:19.612 --> 10:23.048
And even if I did, I didn't
agree to be under house arrest.

10:23.515 --> 10:25.484
You gave your esquire
power of attorney?

10:25.584 --> 10:28.420
Yeah, to feed me and to give me the
drug, not to make me a slave.

10:30.155 --> 10:33.425
- Things change.
- Wait, half the world

10:33.525 --> 10:35.427
is under house arrest,
and your responses is.

10:35.527 --> 10:38.330
- "Things change"?
- It's not house arrest!

10:40.232 --> 10:43.002
You all paid your esquires.
Gave them power of attorney

10:43.102 --> 10:44.903
so you can take
your little miracle drug,

10:45.004 --> 10:47.840
go to sleep, live out
your designated fantasies

10:47.940 --> 10:49.508
in the haze while hardworking

10:49.608 --> 10:52.911
men and women like dries and
myself watched over the world.

10:53.012 --> 10:57.549
You are lucky we ratified the contracts
to let you move around your house.

10:59.084 --> 11:04.456
It's not the esquires whom reliable for
the world in current unforeseen occurrences

11:04.556 --> 11:06.959
while you were in your...

11:13.899 --> 11:17.303
- What's so goddamn funny?
- Nothing. It's just...

11:17.403 --> 11:20.105
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I desist. I desist.

11:20.205 --> 11:21.540
- I desis...
- Shut up, garp!

11:24.143 --> 11:25.511
We are so sorry.

11:28.013 --> 11:29.181
Look, we've had a long week.

11:29.649 --> 11:31.550
We appreciate all you do.

11:34.053 --> 11:35.053
Don't we?

11:48.267 --> 11:49.601
Move to him, I'll take her.

11:57.042 --> 11:58.210
Hello.

11:58.678 --> 12:00.846
- How are you today?
- Fine.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.041
Hard shit.

13:08.648 --> 13:12.117
Did my application for ratification
to update my plan get denied?

13:12.518 --> 13:15.254
- No.
- Well, when do I get on the new plan?

13:18.023 --> 13:19.358
It was not accepted either.

13:20.359 --> 13:21.960
The processes are backlogged.

13:22.361 --> 13:25.297
I've been asking for like
two years since I woke up.

13:25.765 --> 13:27.332
Would you like to file another?

13:31.170 --> 13:33.038
Does anyone have any amendments,

13:33.138 --> 13:36.074
ratification
or any other legal matters?

13:36.175 --> 13:37.342
Yes.

13:38.043 --> 13:39.646
I'd like to request
a new lawyer.

13:43.081 --> 13:45.317
And I'd like the healthiest
eating plan you have,

13:45.417 --> 13:46.552
the same one my dad's on.

13:49.154 --> 13:50.489
Very well.

13:50.589 --> 13:52.458
Oh, yeah, that's right.

13:53.058 --> 13:55.527
Yeah, that's right. Walk around.

13:57.296 --> 13:58.597
Oh, yeah, baby.

13:58.698 --> 14:00.132
That's right, put that hair up.

14:01.701 --> 14:03.202
Oh, yeah.

14:04.036 --> 14:05.237
Oh, come on, baby.

14:06.205 --> 14:08.708
Come on. Here. Don't stop now.

14:09.441 --> 14:13.212
Oh, yeah. Don't stop.
Oh, come on, baby.

14:14.046 --> 14:15.481
Yeah. Keep doing it.

14:16.415 --> 14:18.217
Oh, come on. Don't let me down.

14:18.818 --> 14:20.385
Come on.
Don't let me down, baby.

14:22.187 --> 14:26.525
Come on. Oh, no, no, no, no, don't... don't...
Don't... don't... don't... don't close the blinds.

14:26.625 --> 14:27.837
No, no, no, no, don't close it.

14:27.861 --> 14:29.729
Don't close it. Don't... fuck!

14:33.599 --> 14:34.767
All right.

14:35.802 --> 14:38.270
Ooh, imaginary tits.

14:38.370 --> 14:39.639
Fuck yeah.

14:42.842 --> 14:44.610
Fuck! Garp!

14:50.750 --> 14:54.119
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Learn to knock, faggot!

14:54.620 --> 14:58.524
- What did you call me?
- I meant faggot like it was the word "asshole."

14:58.624 --> 15:00.693
Not like it was
because you're gay.

15:00.793 --> 15:01.793
Okay.

15:04.797 --> 15:06.265
I keep forgetting you're gay.

15:06.365 --> 15:07.734
I keep forgetting it matters.

15:07.834 --> 15:09.234
It doesn't, man.
It's just that...

15:10.602 --> 15:14.339
- I mean, you weren't gay when we went into the haze.
- I was six.

15:15.875 --> 15:17.109
I wasn't sure.

15:18.645 --> 15:21.485
I didn't know it mattered, but it
does matter. At least out here anyway.

15:23.282 --> 15:25.761
In my dream world, or the haze,
or whatever you want to call it.

15:25.785 --> 15:30.589
I never even came out of the closet...
Being gay or straight didn't exist.

15:30.690 --> 15:32.190
You just hooked
up with whomever.

15:32.591 --> 15:34.459
What if you wanted
to have a kid?

15:40.532 --> 15:41.567
I had one.

15:43.803 --> 15:44.804
You had a kid?

15:50.142 --> 15:51.543
Yeah.

15:51.644 --> 15:53.178
Were you jerking off to scout,

15:53.278 --> 15:54.878
the little deaf girl
from across the way?

15:54.948 --> 15:57.482
- She's not that little anymore.
- Neither are you.

15:59.151 --> 16:00.352
Don't go changing the subject.

16:00.452 --> 16:02.487
You never told me
you had a kid in the haze.

16:02.855 --> 16:06.291
I've never really told any of you much
about what the haze was like for me.

16:07.159 --> 16:09.829
Yeah, well, none of us really
ever talked much about it.

16:11.931 --> 16:13.332
It's just weird. You know,

16:13.432 --> 16:15.434
- we're not used to you being...
- A faggot.

16:15.534 --> 16:16.534
No, gay.

16:17.937 --> 16:20.138
It's been fucking
strange for this family.

16:20.238 --> 16:23.676
It's been fucking strange
for the whole world.

16:24.409 --> 16:28.380
I'll never forget mom telling me that some
grown up made a drug that would let us go

16:28.480 --> 16:31.751
into the haze and we would live
happier lives.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.488
I would have anything
I could imagine, literally.

16:39.458 --> 16:41.828
It sounded like that's what
I was supposed to do,

16:41.928 --> 16:43.595
but I didn't get a choice.

16:44.329 --> 16:46.198
The world had no choice.

16:48.868 --> 16:50.569
They did, but they didn't.

16:52.038 --> 16:55.340
You were probably too young to
remember, but we had to take the drug.

16:56.308 --> 17:00.178
Anyone who was in power went into the
haze, I mean, look around.

17:00.747 --> 17:01.814
The haze was better.

17:04.917 --> 17:06.151
I do miss it.

17:10.288 --> 17:12.324
I guess I never told you
about my kid because...

17:14.661 --> 17:15.928
I miss my son.

17:16.796 --> 17:20.599
I mean, I know he wasn't real,
but he was real.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.201
Stop being such a faggot.

17:35.715 --> 17:38.617
- You should get that looked at.
- Yeah, by who, slut?

17:38.718 --> 17:42.287
- Someone who gives a shit.
- You know, ever since in my haze,

17:42.722 --> 17:45.692
you and I still busted each
other's balls all the time.

17:45.792 --> 17:48.795
- I don't have any balls, you ass.
- I'm the ass?

17:48.895 --> 17:52.799
You're the one who basically dreamt
reality, you're so full of yourself.

17:52.899 --> 17:57.369
The best thing you can come up with was you in
the real world as if the haze never existed.

17:57.469 --> 18:01.239
I did not say that I dreamed reality.

18:01.339 --> 18:05.477
- It wasn't exactly like that.
- Let's get back to you wanking off to that little deaf girl

18:05.577 --> 18:08.547
- out the window.
- Wanking? When did you become British?

18:08.648 --> 18:10.983
When I sucked tons of English
cock in the haze.

18:11.084 --> 18:12.250
Eurgh!

18:14.386 --> 18:17.657
- Out with it, chunky.
- Come on. You know I can't help that.

18:17.757 --> 18:20.525
Shouldn't have been so proud
and paid for your own plan.

18:20.625 --> 18:21.828
It's worth my pride.

18:23.361 --> 18:26.498
Plus, we were never supposed to wake up.
And besides, watch the name calling.

18:27.365 --> 18:29.802
- Fine, faggot.
- Touche.

18:31.671 --> 18:35.307
You guys should have taken this super,
duper health plan that dad took.

18:36.075 --> 18:37.609
No way, that would have sucked.

18:37.710 --> 18:39.212
I'd still look like I was six.

18:41.446 --> 18:43.750
Is it weird that dad and I
basically look the same age?

18:43.850 --> 18:48.855
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I
want to hear more about you wanking it

18:48.955 --> 18:50.522
- to the little scout.
- Oh, fuck off!

18:50.622 --> 18:52.524
So here's the dish.

18:55.895 --> 18:56.963
I walk in...

18:58.463 --> 19:02.300
Garp's in his undies, jerking it
with one hand, binoculars in the other.

19:02.835 --> 19:04.075
He throws the binoculars at me.

19:05.570 --> 19:07.774
- Ouch, are you okay by the way?
- Yes.

19:08.340 --> 19:10.676
And somehow we still
have not discussed him

19:10.777 --> 19:12.544
jacking off
to that little deaf girl.

19:15.982 --> 19:17.016
God, I hate that.

19:18.785 --> 19:19.952
Out with it.

19:20.052 --> 19:22.054
Fine. I just want
to see her naked.

19:22.955 --> 19:25.323
When I was in my haze,
I could do whatever I wanted.

19:25.423 --> 19:27.693
I could go where I wanted,
I could eat what I wanted.

19:27.794 --> 19:31.898
I could fuck when I wanted. If I wanted
to fuck eight girls, I fucked 16.

19:31.998 --> 19:34.000
I was a king. I was a rock star.

19:34.100 --> 19:39.839
- A glutton.
- Whatever. I'm proud of who I am and what I am.

19:39.939 --> 19:44.977
I mean, in the haze I got to do whatever
I wanted. I mean, till two years ago

19:45.077 --> 19:49.882
when ward killed himself and that jackass
zaphoid b. Esquire declared that nobody else

19:49.982 --> 19:54.987
can legally make the drug and we've been
out of the haze and fucking on house arrest.

19:56.421 --> 20:00.726
Ever since that fateful fucking bullshit
day when I had to awake to that fucker.

20:00.827 --> 20:04.462
Lord voraz telling me what I can and
can't do. No, no, shh, fuck that.

20:04.563 --> 20:08.100
Ever since I woke to a world
full of lawyers with fucking guns

20:08.201 --> 20:10.335
that tell me what I can
and can't do.

20:10.435 --> 20:13.072
All... all I wanted is to see

20:13.172 --> 20:15.942
little scout Finch, who is no
longer so little by the way.

20:16.608 --> 20:19.111
All I've wanted is
to see that hot girl get naked.

20:19.745 --> 20:21.981
I haven't... I haven't
wanted to be a rock star.

20:22.081 --> 20:23.548
I haven't wanted to be a king.

20:23.649 --> 20:25.718
I haven't
wanted to fuck 16 girls.

20:25.818 --> 20:30.522
I just want to see her get naked or
partially naked or fucking something!

20:32.457 --> 20:37.763
And every night I come into my room,
I grab my binoculars and I shit in the dark

20:37.864 --> 20:41.734
like the shitty old man
I've become and I watch her,

20:41.834 --> 20:46.873
and I think, please shitty
world, please shitty world,

20:46.973 --> 20:51.043
just let her get naked before she closes
the blinds. Every night I think it,

20:51.143 --> 20:55.380
please don't close the blinds,
and every night she closes them.

20:57.582 --> 21:01.954
And every night I realized that the simplest
dream can't come true anymore and I want to die.

21:04.857 --> 21:09.028
She closes the blinds and
my fat sickly ass wants to die.

21:17.937 --> 21:19.138
Get naked.

21:22.208 --> 21:25.610
- What?
- Get naked and get in front of the window.

21:26.679 --> 21:30.650
If everyone in the world who wanted
to see naked people in the window

21:30.750 --> 21:34.486
just stood naked in their windows,
then there will be plenty of naked people

21:34.586 --> 21:38.456
in the windows. Get up,
get naked, be what you want.

21:39.892 --> 21:40.892
All right.

21:41.593 --> 21:42.593
I will.

21:44.897 --> 21:46.766
Thank you.
That's all I'm saying.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.769
Whoa! No, no, no...

21:49.869 --> 21:52.004
- Ha-ha!
- Not now!

21:52.104 --> 21:53.706
Yeah!

21:59.511 --> 22:03.115
Hey. Hey, guys, come here.
She's opening her blinds.

22:33.713 --> 22:34.714
I'll be damned.

22:36.182 --> 22:37.549
What do you make of that?

22:41.988 --> 22:45.891
- Today is officially two new a.D.
- That's right.

22:45.992 --> 22:50.528
Time sure does fly. Two years ago
to this day in the year of our ward,

22:50.629 --> 22:57.502
ward took his own life at the tender age
of 121 and left the hazers or druggies

22:57.602 --> 23:02.507
without their medicine and turned the
world upside down as he always did.

23:03.109 --> 23:06.846
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.
- I want to hear this.

23:06.946 --> 23:09.882
He sure was a great
man and we all miss him dearly.

23:09.982 --> 23:14.020
Ward was running for president and was the
most beloved Americans since the ancient

23:14.120 --> 23:17.289
Bobby Kennedy when he shocked
the world by attempting suicide.

23:18.324 --> 23:19.959
Goddamn TV sniggle.

23:23.329 --> 23:27.599
The world cried for ward until six
months after that suicide attempt,

23:27.700 --> 23:29.802
when he made
that fateful speech.

23:30.970 --> 23:32.972
- Hello.
- Remember that, hun?

23:33.072 --> 23:35.841
- No matter how much I've had in life...
- What?

23:36.675 --> 23:40.913
No matter how much I achieve, I...
I've always felt alone,

23:41.714 --> 23:45.317
I tried to kill myself because
nothing made me happy anymore.

23:46.085 --> 23:49.554
I was going to be the president
of the United States of America,

23:49.655 --> 23:54.126
the country I love, and still
nothing would bring me joy.

23:54.794 --> 23:57.863
I asked myself,
what is the meaning of life?

23:58.731 --> 24:00.900
I didn't ask it
in a large worldly way.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.569
But in a simple way,
I asked for the definition.

24:05.037 --> 24:09.208
I think scientists believe life is an
organism that uses oxygen or water.

24:09.875 --> 24:15.580
I mean, years ago when they sent those
probes to space, that's how scientists

24:15.681 --> 24:17.650
looked for life,
by looking for water.

24:19.051 --> 24:24.290
But they never found life,
and I decided they probably never would.

24:26.125 --> 24:31.864
I mean, if they look by looking for
water, that's not what life is.

24:32.331 --> 24:35.901
I mean, if something walked up to
me and said, "hi, ward, how are you?

24:36.001 --> 24:37.001
How are you doing today?"

24:37.369 --> 24:40.906
And it... it didn't
need oxygen or water,

24:41.006 --> 24:42.908
I would still consider it alive.

24:44.009 --> 24:45.010
Fuck!

24:50.049 --> 24:51.383
Decided that the scientific

24:51.484 --> 24:53.352
definition of life was wrong.

24:53.452 --> 24:57.723
I decided that the meaning
of life was what I feel,

24:58.124 --> 25:01.260
and if all I was going to feel
was horrible all the time,

25:01.360 --> 25:03.028
why would I want to keep living?

25:03.996 --> 25:07.333
So, I decided to commit suicide.

25:08.734 --> 25:12.638
When I woke up in the hospital
and my doctor told me

25:12.738 --> 25:16.742
everything was going to be okay,
I reached out to take his hand.

25:17.376 --> 25:21.113
I realized he was a hologram
from a remote TV sniggle.

25:22.748 --> 25:26.085
This made me know that I was
not connected to anyone.

25:27.052 --> 25:32.925
I realized that with technology and sniggles,
we have all withered into our own space.

25:33.726 --> 25:38.864
I was actually considering suicide
again when when the doctor told me

25:38.964 --> 25:42.001
about a successful suicide that
had taken place the day before.

25:44.136 --> 25:47.840
It... it was a suicide of
a childhood friend of mine.

25:58.150 --> 26:03.055
I thought if someone that grew up
where I grew up and how I grew up

26:03.155 --> 26:08.327
could kill himself and... and we
couldn't understand it or stop it...

26:09.962 --> 26:13.199
Then how could we understand
people in different places?

26:13.299 --> 26:18.938
How could we understand things
larger than us or smaller than us?

26:19.038 --> 26:23.275
Or more importantly, how could
we understand something like god

26:24.076 --> 26:29.248
or an interconnected energy
or... or anything like that.

26:30.149 --> 26:34.153
I realized...
Life isn't what I feel.

26:34.253 --> 26:37.189
It's what... what we all feel.

26:38.157 --> 26:41.227
I wasn't depressed.
I was disconnected.

26:41.894 --> 26:46.298
I want so badly to be connected, to have
meaningful relationships with others.

26:46.398 --> 26:52.037
But today everyone is so caught
up in the world that exists

26:52.137 --> 26:54.373
that I find it
no longer possible.

26:54.473 --> 26:58.310
So, I have invented the drug.

26:59.311 --> 27:01.380
And we all know
what happened from there.

27:01.480 --> 27:05.251
The richest of the rich and the most
powerful people were on it until...

27:05.351 --> 27:09.922
Until all the assholes who ruled the earth,
like my father, gave away all their money

27:10.022 --> 27:14.126
to lawyers so they could go on the drug until
those lawyers wanted to go on the drug too,

27:14.226 --> 27:18.364
so they deputized other lawyers to take
care of them and us and so on and so on.

27:18.464 --> 27:23.769
Until goddamn 25% of the earth was
deputized lawyers, and 50% of the people

27:23.869 --> 27:30.009
were on a drug, and 25% of everyone
else took care of everything else!

27:30.109 --> 27:33.345
- God, shut up!
- Until the whole world was under one form of government

27:33.445 --> 27:37.016
called contractualism,
and idiots ruled,

27:37.116 --> 27:41.353
and ten percent of fuck was
fuck, and everything that sucked

27:41.453 --> 27:45.190
just sucked and magic!
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

27:45.291 --> 27:47.860
- Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!
- Shut up, garp!

27:47.960 --> 27:49.028
Fuck off.

27:53.365 --> 27:55.934
You know, if you just
wouldn't let ward be alone,

27:56.035 --> 27:59.938
this never would've happened. The drug
didn't work on him. If he just interacted,

28:00.039 --> 28:01.273
we wouldn't be in this mess.

28:19.558 --> 28:23.195
Dad will never admit it. But they're
never going to ratify the contracts,

28:23.295 --> 28:24.973
- they'll just leave this house.
- Don't say that.

28:24.997 --> 28:27.166
They won't even let me pay
to eat healthy

28:27.266 --> 28:29.068
or to change my clothes.

28:30.269 --> 28:32.604
You're the one that chose
the cheap health food plan.

28:33.939 --> 28:37.843
Well, I didn't think I was gonna have to
wake up and be a chunky, disheveled mess.

28:37.943 --> 28:41.380
I didn't know I was going to have
to be sick from gas and junk food.

28:43.182 --> 28:44.450
It doesn't matter now.

28:46.085 --> 28:49.888
Fred kinnan esquire's never gonna let
zaphoid b. Esquire ratify our contracts.

28:49.988 --> 28:53.392
We're never gonna be free. We're never
going to be allowed to go outside.

28:53.492 --> 28:54.526
How ludicrous is that?

28:56.161 --> 29:02.101
The union of united esquires, attorneys
with guns that control the entire world.

29:02.201 --> 29:04.103
I mean, who could even
make that shit up?

29:06.472 --> 29:11.076
One government that rules the world called
contractualism that forces everybody

29:11.176 --> 29:13.979
to follow their contracts
or die is ludicrous.

29:16.248 --> 29:19.585
Do you really think that
the union of united esquires

29:19.686 --> 29:22.254
is why the legal controller
won't ratify our contracts?

29:24.590 --> 29:29.328
Sols, I had to yell "I desist"
with a fucking gun in my face.

29:33.098 --> 29:35.234
I don't even think desist
should be a word.

29:39.605 --> 29:41.907
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I want to be alone.

29:45.444 --> 29:46.612
We're in my room.

29:50.482 --> 29:51.550
Fine.

30:54.279 --> 31:00.586
I, zaphoid b. Esquire, solemnly swear
that we are still working to ratify

31:00.687 --> 31:06.058
these contracts. And we will try to meet
our deadline of January 8th, two new a.D.

31:06.158 --> 31:07.158
Next week.

31:07.861 --> 31:10.329
And now... I will take
a few questions.

31:10.697 --> 31:13.031
Ready for press member
number one.

31:14.233 --> 31:17.704
Is Fred kinnan esquire against
ratifications altogether?

31:17.804 --> 31:20.773
Oh, you would have to ask him
that, but I would think not.

31:23.375 --> 31:26.445
Is there ever a chance that the
contracts will all be nullified

31:26.545 --> 31:29.716
and people can go back to being
what they want without fear of death

31:29.816 --> 31:32.160
and... and... and...
And imprisonment within their own home?

31:32.184 --> 31:36.488
I'm sorry. I can't hear you,
but I think I know what you're asking...

31:37.623 --> 31:39.157
Will we ever go to...

31:50.469 --> 31:52.805
I am so sick
of being in this house.

32:10.890 --> 32:13.125
What's so funny?

32:13.225 --> 32:16.428
Nothing. It's just... nothing.

32:16.896 --> 32:18.297
Come on, out with it.

32:19.598 --> 32:23.135
It's just, you're having a little
trouble with the makeup sniggle.

32:23.235 --> 32:25.337
- Goddamnit.
- Mom.

32:25.437 --> 32:27.306
Sorry, it's just frustrating.

32:36.381 --> 32:37.583
Let me help you.

32:40.619 --> 32:42.621
An old lady at 35.

32:46.659 --> 32:49.161
Not to dissuade your exuberance,
but you're 55, mom.

32:49.796 --> 32:53.098
Yeah, but I blinked when
I was 35 and awoke an old lady.

32:53.599 --> 32:55.601
Must be strange for you.

32:56.736 --> 33:00.305
For all of us, we lived in dreams
that have more realistic time.

33:01.239 --> 33:02.341
I just blinked.

33:04.911 --> 33:06.746
What was it like to be gas?

33:07.947 --> 33:09.649
It wasn't gas exactly.

33:10.917 --> 33:12.819
Just kind of didn't exist.

33:14.319 --> 33:15.688
It was like I was floating.

33:17.757 --> 33:19.859
And there was nothing...

33:21.593 --> 33:22.594
And everything.

33:25.564 --> 33:26.598
It was.

33:39.979 --> 33:41.881
Ow.

33:42.547 --> 33:43.650
You okay in there?

33:43.750 --> 33:44.751
Fine.

33:46.953 --> 33:48.253
You coming to bed?

33:49.321 --> 33:51.256
Damn toothbrush sniggle broke.

33:52.391 --> 33:56.328
- Use mine.
- You know, in my dream,

33:56.428 --> 33:59.666
we didn't even have to brush.
We were always just clean.

34:00.633 --> 34:01.633
Everything was clean.

34:02.334 --> 34:03.703
Everything was perfect.

34:11.276 --> 34:12.577
I can sense you're there.

34:13.578 --> 34:14.647
What's wrong?

34:18.818 --> 34:20.920
Nothing, babe.

34:21.654 --> 34:23.656
Just so sick of
everything always breaking.

34:23.756 --> 34:25.758
Breaking... breaking...

34:25.858 --> 34:27.827
Breaking...

34:32.597 --> 34:33.597
What?

34:36.501 --> 34:39.204
You mean me? I'm breaking.

34:39.806 --> 34:43.575
No... not you.

34:47.345 --> 34:48.881
These damn sniggles.

34:51.050 --> 34:52.350
Our house.

34:54.386 --> 34:55.688
Our futures.

34:57.322 --> 34:58.423
I can feel it.

35:00.059 --> 35:02.294
Age was always
so important to you.

35:02.995 --> 35:04.664
You're not
attracted to me anymore.

35:04.997 --> 35:07.432
Yes, I am.

35:10.435 --> 35:11.435
Then take me.

35:14.339 --> 35:17.275
- I'm just not...
- You're not attracted to me.

35:18.678 --> 35:22.581
D... don't be ridiculous.
Of course I am.

35:22.682 --> 35:23.850
That's bullshit.

35:25.250 --> 35:27.887
While you were off living in a
world where we were young and hot,

35:27.987 --> 35:29.756
I got old, old and blind.

35:32.024 --> 35:34.526
Sure you got a little older.

35:34.626 --> 35:38.765
But... you're still the most
beautiful girl in the world.

35:38.865 --> 35:40.700
That's bs helm, and you know it.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.535
I may be blind
but I'm not blind.

35:44.837 --> 35:49.041
When couples grow old together,
it works, the change is gradual.

35:49.142 --> 35:55.982
You don't notice. But with us, you've
been gone for 20 years in some great dream

35:56.082 --> 35:57.717
in the haze with perfection.

36:01.020 --> 36:02.587
In your world, we never aged.

36:05.590 --> 36:09.327
We were just hot. And you woke
up looking that way.

36:12.597 --> 36:15.802
You're a good man
and you try to hide it.

36:15.902 --> 36:18.871
But you were and are vain.

36:20.605 --> 36:23.375
I think being in the moment
is amazing.

36:25.111 --> 36:26.779
I'm not as vain as you think.

36:29.715 --> 36:30.715
What was that?

36:30.783 --> 36:32.885
Oh, nothing.

36:35.420 --> 36:38.323
For me, the haze
was a spectacular few seconds.

36:40.059 --> 36:41.761
Then I wake up a second later,

36:42.427 --> 36:44.997
I'm old, my husband doesn't want
me, my kids are all depressed,

36:45.097 --> 36:47.834
I'm locked in the house and my
husband can't even have sex with me.

36:48.533 --> 36:51.403
If that were true.

36:51.904 --> 36:53.438
Would I be this turned on?

36:55.507 --> 36:57.910
Oh, helmholtz,
I know that voice.

37:01.180 --> 37:02.782
Oh, helmholtz, oh!

37:02.882 --> 37:04.884
Oh, helmholtz!

37:04.984 --> 37:07.086
- Oh!
- I want you so bad.

37:07.186 --> 37:09.387
Okay, that's good.
Right there. Like that!

37:09.487 --> 37:11.824
Oh, my... I'm gonna come.

37:11.924 --> 37:13.491
I'm coming.

37:13.592 --> 37:15.360
Ah! I'm gonna come.

37:17.897 --> 37:19.832
I'm gonna come. I'm coming!

37:19.932 --> 37:23.135
Yeah!

39:41.207 --> 39:43.776
<i>So, that my friends,
is where it stands.</i>

39:44.243 --> 39:48.781
Though the union of united
esquires is not happy at this time,

39:49.348 --> 39:52.118
we are confident
ratifications can be made.

39:53.019 --> 39:56.922
Looks like final ratifications will
be put off for at least another month.

39:57.589 --> 40:01.260
- Hey, I was watching that!
- Chill, pops, it's paused, not off.

40:01.360 --> 40:04.830
- That's big news, garp.
- It's the same news it is every night, dad.

40:04.930 --> 40:06.531
- Listen...
- Calm down, you guys.

40:06.932 --> 40:08.868
Every freaking night.

40:13.939 --> 40:14.939
What do you need?

40:18.177 --> 40:20.880
- Can I use your encyclopedia sniggle?
- Yeah, it's in my room.

40:20.980 --> 40:23.548
Can you rig it to help me
translate that sign

40:23.649 --> 40:25.785
- tippy talk language?
- I think so.

40:26.185 --> 40:27.319
All right, come on.

40:29.789 --> 40:31.991
- I want a girl's voice.
- Okay.

40:32.658 --> 40:35.261
No, that's the upper
etched line, as they say.

40:36.629 --> 40:37.629
The brass.

41:01.954 --> 41:03.756
Any new ratification requests?

41:11.197 --> 41:12.231
What?

41:14.300 --> 41:16.268
They don't have any power.
They can't do shit.

41:17.837 --> 41:19.371
In fact,
they're more like servants.

41:19.939 --> 41:23.008
You have to clean us,
feed us, bring us new clothes.

41:23.109 --> 41:25.044
If you think about it,
you're more like my bitch.

41:27.179 --> 41:31.784
If that's true
than why am I standing here

41:31.884 --> 41:34.753
and you are stuck in the house.

41:34.854 --> 41:36.956
- "Than?"
- what?

41:37.056 --> 41:39.325
"Then," you idiot. Not "than."

41:40.426 --> 41:47.266
And you can leave because either you or
your family were too poor or too stupid

41:47.366 --> 41:49.902
- to go on the drug.
- What did you say to me?

41:50.970 --> 41:53.205
Hard of hearing?

41:53.305 --> 41:54.640
Cut it out, garp.

41:55.407 --> 41:57.376
You are displeasing your mother.

41:57.476 --> 42:00.246
What? Contract says
I can air my grievances.

42:03.282 --> 42:04.650
Do you have any more?

42:06.018 --> 42:07.018
No.

42:10.122 --> 42:12.725
Very well... then.

42:41.887 --> 42:44.156
<i>Step away from the exit.</i>

42:44.823 --> 42:48.694
<i>You are not within the safe distance
from the exit, step away from the exit.</i>

42:48.794 --> 42:50.396
<i>You are now safe.</i>

42:52.131 --> 42:56.702
- What the fuck was that for?
- I am contracted to keep you in line with your contract.

42:56.802 --> 43:00.472
Your contract says you are not
allowed to travel outside.

43:00.573 --> 43:03.493
Yeah, but I didn't, didn't you hear
the voice? I just got close. Fuck off!

43:04.076 --> 43:05.911
Get out. Hey!

43:08.247 --> 43:11.884
If you had made it, you'd have
been in breach of contract.

43:12.851 --> 43:13.852
And I'd have killed you.

43:14.954 --> 43:16.455
- Then do it, bitch.
- No.

43:16.555 --> 43:18.290
- Really?
- Get off him!

43:18.390 --> 43:20.960
Please. Please, stop.
I'm scared.

43:23.329 --> 43:24.329
What?

43:36.375 --> 43:37.375
I'm sorry, man.

43:40.145 --> 43:43.382
I was just trying
to enforce the contract.

43:44.883 --> 43:46.051
It's okay.

43:46.485 --> 43:48.120
I just hate violence.

43:56.295 --> 43:58.998
Sir, we have to go.

44:03.535 --> 44:07.940
Formally requesting new esquires
and a better, healthier eating plan.

44:09.875 --> 44:10.875
Noted.

44:17.182 --> 44:19.918
Fucking assholes!

44:20.386 --> 44:23.889
- Fuck yeah, dad.
- I was talking about you too.

44:25.024 --> 44:26.358
Well, thanks anyway, old timer.

44:26.458 --> 44:28.527
Old timer?

44:30.095 --> 44:31.130
You're the old timer.

44:32.131 --> 44:33.299
I'm not old.

44:34.768 --> 44:38.037
- I didn't get old. Remember?
- It really does not matter so much, pops.

44:38.137 --> 44:42.374
Old is old. Young is young.
Thanks for taking one for the team, sols.

44:42.975 --> 44:44.443
Who says I was faking it.

44:45.377 --> 44:48.013
- Everybody, bitch.
- Language.

44:48.113 --> 44:50.249
- Take a pill, mom.
- Absolutely not.

44:50.349 --> 44:52.918
Never again.

44:55.387 --> 44:57.256
It's nice to have us
all together like this.

44:57.657 --> 44:59.925
It reminds me of
the old family dinners.

45:00.025 --> 45:01.460
Don't bring up dinner.

45:02.294 --> 45:03.896
I miss eating so much.

45:03.996 --> 45:05.464
How much does it suck
that I'm fat

45:05.564 --> 45:07.466
and I don't even
get to taste food.

45:10.302 --> 45:13.472
- Let's have dinner.
- There's no food, ass.

45:13.572 --> 45:16.375
- Language.
- That doesn't mean we can't have dinner.

45:18.510 --> 45:19.510
I'll go set the table.

45:28.487 --> 45:31.023
- We can do this every night.
- Mm-hmm.

45:31.691 --> 45:33.192
That we can agree on.

45:36.962 --> 45:39.565
In my dad's haze,
everyone was perfect.

45:39.666 --> 45:43.235
No one aged, no one got sick,
no one gaining weight.

45:44.236 --> 45:46.004
I mean, everyone
was just perfect.

45:47.005 --> 45:50.643
He and I basically look the same age
now, which is really weird.

45:50.744 --> 45:54.580
My sister solsbury basically
dreamt that she was herself

45:54.681 --> 45:56.415
as if she had never taken
the drug.

45:58.150 --> 46:00.730
I mean, she would have been a huge success
in the real world, in business or whatever.

46:00.754 --> 46:02.187
So I guess
it kind of makes sense.

46:02.287 --> 46:05.157
But I mean, she basically
dreamt the drug away.

46:06.726 --> 46:08.961
<i>It's amazing
how even the people that did not</i>

46:09.061 --> 46:10.929
<i>want the drug
ended up hazers anyway.</i>

46:11.029 --> 46:12.498
<i>They were just losing
their ability</i>

46:12.598 --> 46:14.066
<i>to succeed
because too many other</i>

46:14.166 --> 46:15.334
<i>powerful people checked out.</i>

46:17.002 --> 46:18.002
I know.

46:20.707 --> 46:23.142
<i>What about the rest of you
and the rest of your family?</i>

46:23.976 --> 46:25.244
Well, my little brother...

46:26.578 --> 46:30.048
How do I put it?
I guess he was in a world of acceptance.

46:31.083 --> 46:35.254
I mean, he's gay, but he was six
when he went into the haze

46:35.354 --> 46:37.289
so he didn't
really know that then.

46:37.389 --> 46:42.428
So, in his haze, everyone was
just free to be what they wanted.

46:43.395 --> 46:47.433
My mom... my mom's haze
is crazy.

46:48.567 --> 46:52.571
She, like,
blinked and it was over.

46:53.138 --> 46:55.708
Like, she describes it as if

46:55.809 --> 46:58.944
she was just, like, gas or air.

46:59.344 --> 47:02.147
And her haze lasted, like,

47:02.247 --> 47:04.116
only a couple of seconds
and then it was over.

47:05.217 --> 47:06.418
And when she woke up...

47:08.755 --> 47:11.691
When she woke up she was
blind, here in the real world.

47:15.327 --> 47:18.665
<i>She went blind in her dream.
That's horrible. I'm sorry.</i>

47:19.598 --> 47:24.102
Oh, no, she's... she's great.
She's okay.

47:24.203 --> 47:26.205
I mean, I hope she's okay.
I think she is.

47:26.739 --> 47:32.110
And me. Well,
I pretty much did everything

47:32.211 --> 47:36.148
that anyone says they would do
if they could do anything.

47:36.248 --> 47:40.152
I was a total selfish pig.

47:40.787 --> 47:45.057
<i>You're an honest person, garp.
I am just happy to have you to talk with.</i>

47:45.157 --> 47:46.625
<i>I feel like
we really communicate.</i>

47:46.726 --> 47:48.327
<i>It's really nice.</i>

47:49.696 --> 47:53.432
I know, right? I mean,
we've only been up for a couple of years,

47:53.532 --> 47:55.501
which is a long time
if you think about it.

47:55.601 --> 48:01.139
But we were in our hazes for so long
that I think that we're really only

48:01.240 --> 48:03.442
used to communicating
with ourselves.

48:04.409 --> 48:09.081
You know, I feel like
I speak so simply.

48:09.181 --> 48:12.719
I feel like...
I only communicated with myself

48:12.819 --> 48:15.655
for so long
that I forgot how to speak

48:15.755 --> 48:21.393
universally, intellectually
or to each other...

48:22.494 --> 48:24.429
If that makes any sense at all.

48:24.530 --> 48:27.734
My description
is overly descriptive.

48:28.635 --> 48:32.137
I don't know. See,
I'm so bad at communicating,

48:32.237 --> 48:35.107
I can't even communicate
how bad I am at communicating,

48:36.208 --> 48:37.342
<i>that's so fish.</i>

48:40.379 --> 48:41.681
"That's so fish"?

48:44.416 --> 48:47.219
<i>Not "that's so fish."
That's so true.</i>

48:48.688 --> 48:50.389
Oh.

48:55.561 --> 48:58.597
<i>I wish you knew tippy talk language
so we wouldn't need that damn thing.</i>

49:00.566 --> 49:07.272
Hey. Just because I am a
sniggle, does not mean I do not feel.

49:12.712 --> 49:15.581
<i>See, that is exactly why
we don't need that damn thing.</i>

49:16.916 --> 49:18.283
<i>Learn tippy talk.</i>

49:18.383 --> 49:20.753
Uh, if I learn it,
will you get naked?

49:22.822 --> 49:24.289
<i>Pervert...</i>

49:24.757 --> 49:26.693
Well, will you? Is that a "yes"?

49:29.662 --> 49:33.866
<i>Yeah. If you learn fluent tippy talk
language, I will let you see me naked.</i>

49:33.967 --> 49:35.300
<i>You happy?</i>

49:35.400 --> 49:36.836
Hell yeah!

49:39.171 --> 49:41.674
<i>You're not going to do it.</i>

57:28.240 --> 57:29.240
Good morning.

57:31.977 --> 57:36.849
I haven't felt this connected to anyone,
to the world, to anything in so long.

57:38.217 --> 57:41.654
I haven't felt this connected
ever inside the haze or out.

57:52.865 --> 57:53.865
Let's get married.

57:57.937 --> 58:00.372
Yeah. You...

58:00.473 --> 58:02.908
So, that's zaphoid.

58:03.008 --> 58:05.978
- And that's...
- That's Fred kinnan.

58:06.078 --> 58:08.280
- Ratified.
- The truth is... hold on!

58:08.380 --> 58:11.117
Hold on! Hold on! The truth is...

58:11.217 --> 58:13.618
Great job on the puppets
and the set.

58:15.855 --> 58:19.091
The only reason these contracts have
not been ratified yet is because...

58:19.191 --> 58:20.392
The zaphoid puppet is hot.

58:25.164 --> 58:28.300
What's your attraction
to esquires all about anyway?

58:28.400 --> 58:30.936
What are you talking about?
I was making a joke about a puppet.

58:31.871 --> 58:37.843
- Uh, I see you looking at dries gloton esquire.
- Please.

58:39.078 --> 58:41.013
You can tell me.
I'm your sister.

58:41.780 --> 58:44.717
- Talk to the hand. Don't touch it.
- God, that's the gayest thing

58:44.817 --> 58:47.217
- you've ever said.
- Fuck you, sis. You're acting like garp.

58:48.754 --> 58:50.890
Lately, I'm thinking
that's not a bad way to be.

58:56.128 --> 58:57.296
Fine.

58:58.063 --> 58:59.063
Fine what?

59:01.867 --> 59:04.403
In the spirit of
our brutally honest brother...

59:07.740 --> 59:10.142
- I think dries is cute, okay?
- I knew it.

59:15.147 --> 59:18.817
I wish I felt the same way about that
asshole who was grabbing my tits.

59:22.521 --> 59:24.123
You play it well, sis.

59:25.124 --> 59:26.124
You play it well.

59:31.030 --> 59:32.765
So you really want
to fuck that puppet?

59:37.102 --> 59:39.939
I would like to ask you
permission to marry your daughter?

59:48.180 --> 59:50.849
The only thing in this world
that keeps me going is her.

59:51.183 --> 59:55.254
I swear I will do anything
necessary to keep her happy.

59:57.356 --> 59:58.356
Is this what you want?

1:00:03.796 --> 1:00:05.531
Mom...

1:00:05.564 --> 1:00:08.200
I've been thinking a lot about
before we went into the haze,

1:00:08.234 --> 1:00:11.403
how you used to say that life was better
when you have that certain someone.

1:00:13.105 --> 1:00:15.140
Well, I found my someone.

1:00:15.975 --> 1:00:17.109
I'm getting married.

1:00:17.977 --> 1:00:19.912
To who? How?

1:00:20.012 --> 1:00:22.314
You remember
scout from next door?

1:00:23.282 --> 1:00:25.451
The little deaf girl?

1:00:26.118 --> 1:00:27.987
She's not little anymore.

1:00:28.387 --> 1:00:31.357
- No fucking way. You actually...
- Language.

1:00:33.058 --> 1:00:34.226
Sorry.

1:00:35.461 --> 1:00:36.795
How?

1:00:37.363 --> 1:00:38.530
He got naked.

1:00:39.531 --> 1:00:42.234
- What?
- He got naked.

1:00:42.334 --> 1:00:43.578
Well, this is
kind of embarrassing.

1:00:43.602 --> 1:00:47.206
But yeah, I got naked and i'm
getting married because of it.

1:00:47.239 --> 1:00:50.009
And it changed my whole
miserable, locked up life, so...

1:00:50.042 --> 1:00:51.443
Hold on. Wait a minute.

1:00:51.977 --> 1:00:53.078
Life is miserable?

1:00:55.547 --> 1:00:56.849
Is it, garp?

1:00:57.383 --> 1:00:58.383
Well...

1:00:59.251 --> 1:01:00.251
Yeah.

1:01:00.953 --> 1:01:03.389
It is, dad.
It's pretty miserable.

1:01:03.422 --> 1:01:04.957
I think all of our lives are.

1:01:10.396 --> 1:01:11.997
Come here, son.

1:01:12.097 --> 1:01:16.235
All right. Ooh. Okay.

1:01:17.002 --> 1:01:19.104
Honey, back to the
getting married.

1:01:19.138 --> 1:01:23.575
Okay, well, when we woke up, I saw that
I could see into scout's bedroom window

1:01:23.609 --> 1:01:27.613
from my bedroom window. So I've been
spending a lot of time trying to see her

1:01:27.647 --> 1:01:29.481
get naked.

1:01:29.581 --> 1:01:31.950
- Garp...
- Well, I'm sorry, but it's true.

1:01:31.984 --> 1:01:35.888
And one night augustine and solsbury
kind of walked in on me, so...

1:01:35.921 --> 1:01:38.957
Wait, your brother and sister
caught you rolling the dice?

1:01:38.991 --> 1:01:42.194
- That's not funny.
- Rolling the dice.

1:01:42.227 --> 1:01:43.495
Dad, that's great.

1:01:44.296 --> 1:01:46.899
No, mom, mom, mom,

1:01:46.932 --> 1:01:50.069
solsbury told me I should just
get naked and stand in the window.

1:01:51.003 --> 1:01:53.581
She told me that if everybody in the
world who wanted to see naked people

1:01:53.605 --> 1:01:56.284
in the window would just stand naked
in the window, then there'd be plenty

1:01:56.308 --> 1:02:01.280
of naked people in the window.
So I got naked and she saw me and...

1:02:02.514 --> 1:02:03.514
Garp...

1:02:06.151 --> 1:02:09.121
Did she get naked too?

1:02:11.056 --> 1:02:15.527
- What?
- No. No, well, not right away anyway but she laughed.

1:02:15.561 --> 1:02:18.964
And since then for the last six
months we've been communicating.

1:02:18.997 --> 1:02:20.933
I even learned
tippy talk language for her.

1:02:22.301 --> 1:02:25.104
But how can you get married?
You can't even touch.

1:02:25.204 --> 1:02:27.072
You don't have
to touch to connect.

1:02:28.006 --> 1:02:30.886
You just have to put out what you want
and hope to get it back in return.

1:02:34.213 --> 1:02:38.050
The u. Of u.E. Wants people
to leave their houses.

1:02:38.083 --> 1:02:39.251
Zaphoid knows that.

1:02:40.152 --> 1:02:42.888
Well, we do need
to get this done.

1:02:44.089 --> 1:02:47.359
Are you insinuating
that things are in any way

1:02:47.459 --> 1:02:50.162
any different,
Mr. Legal controller?

1:02:51.063 --> 1:02:52.998
Well, no, I just think
you and I...

1:02:53.031 --> 1:02:54.431
You are the controller
of the world.

1:02:55.534 --> 1:02:58.103
You and only you can make
this happen, not the u. Of u.E.

1:02:58.203 --> 1:03:01.340
We are merely a union
of hardworking attorneys.

1:03:02.441 --> 1:03:08.080
Please, sir. I am not so much a controller
as I am a single hardworking public servant.

1:03:08.180 --> 1:03:11.580
Well, if you keep up that attitude, there's
no way we'll get these ratifications done.

1:03:13.452 --> 1:03:17.356
So, it will be at least another
month before ratifications are made.

1:03:17.456 --> 1:03:20.426
Reportedly, the druggies
are growing pretty restless.

1:03:20.526 --> 1:03:24.631
It's been more than two and a half years since
they left the haze and they still haven't

1:03:24.731 --> 1:03:27.232
- left their houses.
- That's right. Sympathizers want them

1:03:27.332 --> 1:03:30.169
to go outside and join society.
But the u. Of u.E.

1:03:30.269 --> 1:03:33.972
Insists that if they do, they want to
make sure they are well taken care of.

1:03:34.072 --> 1:03:37.209
And no good solution for what
can be done has been found yet.

1:03:37.309 --> 1:03:40.312
Although we are assured
that a solution will be found.

1:03:40.412 --> 1:03:43.582
And let's not forget that some
of the public feels as though

1:03:43.683 --> 1:03:47.654
because they were in the haze for so
long doing whatever they wanted to do,

1:03:47.754 --> 1:03:52.357
that it might be okay for them to
spend some time inside their own houses

1:03:52.458 --> 1:03:53.492
doing nothing.

1:04:03.035 --> 1:04:05.304
They didn't pass the
ratifications again this month?

1:04:07.072 --> 1:04:09.508
It doesn't mean they won't.

1:04:11.076 --> 1:04:15.113
Why are you always so pessimistic?
Things will work out, garp.

1:04:17.817 --> 1:04:19.551
Okay, dad.

1:04:21.721 --> 1:04:23.422
- "Okay"?
- Yeah.

1:04:24.824 --> 1:04:28.026
Okay. I mean, I know you're just
putting out what you want in return

1:04:28.126 --> 1:04:30.996
and if what you want from me
is positivity,

1:04:31.096 --> 1:04:34.199
then, well, I might not agree with
it but I'll try and give it to you.

1:04:36.803 --> 1:04:38.203
Is that what you think I want?

1:04:40.606 --> 1:04:41.606
Yeah.

1:04:48.213 --> 1:04:49.682
I can't believe
how grown up you are.

1:04:50.482 --> 1:04:51.684
Or out.

1:05:02.127 --> 1:05:03.763
This is not okay, son.

1:05:11.103 --> 1:05:13.572
I don't really think these
contracts are getting ratified.

1:05:15.742 --> 1:05:17.209
I just want to give you hope.

1:05:20.680 --> 1:05:22.114
Yeah, I know, dad.

1:05:27.586 --> 1:05:28.655
Well, tell me now.

1:05:30.790 --> 1:05:32.524
You're finding hope on your own.

1:05:46.739 --> 1:05:51.310
It's, uh, nice to see
such a good mood.

1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:03.488
Did you fuck my sister
while she was sleeping?

1:06:05.424 --> 1:06:07.526
What you...
What did you just say?

1:06:07.626 --> 1:06:10.830
It's a fair question,
because you're always so perfect with her.

1:06:11.898 --> 1:06:14.634
Shit. Did you fuck people
while they were asleep?

1:06:19.672 --> 1:06:21.206
You did, didn't you?

1:06:24.176 --> 1:06:25.712
- Did you?
- Lay down, garp!

1:06:26.713 --> 1:06:29.682
Please, please. Let...

1:06:29.782 --> 1:06:32.250
Please. Don't pay him any mind.

1:06:34.353 --> 1:06:35.793
He has a very strange
sense of humor.

1:06:36.355 --> 1:06:37.355
Very.

1:06:44.262 --> 1:06:48.266
It's just that... I hate to
see a lady such as yourself...

1:06:48.768 --> 1:06:52.204
- Have to hear such things.
- That's so sweet.

1:06:52.839 --> 1:06:55.908
But I do think those things.

1:07:12.692 --> 1:07:15.460
It's a happy day.

1:07:22.267 --> 1:07:23.836
No grooming or extras today?

1:07:28.607 --> 1:07:29.676
Time to go, boss.

1:07:30.943 --> 1:07:33.303
- Let me finish rounds before you.
- Yeah. Thank you, dries.

1:07:34.814 --> 1:07:37.616
Anyone else need to put in
for any gratifications?

1:07:38.316 --> 1:07:39.752
Garp needs a doctor.

1:07:41.286 --> 1:07:42.287
I have requested it.

1:07:43.455 --> 1:07:45.223
Does he have
any chance of seeing one?

1:07:46.591 --> 1:07:47.760
I requested it.

1:07:48.761 --> 1:07:51.530
No. Wow.

1:07:54.399 --> 1:07:55.467
Anything else?

1:07:57.003 --> 1:08:01.708
I am formally requesting new esquires
and the healthiest meal plan you have.

1:08:01.808 --> 1:08:02.808
Noted.

1:08:06.578 --> 1:08:07.780
Assholes!

1:08:09.916 --> 1:08:12.952
Garp, what was that you were
saying about him and your sister?

1:08:14.020 --> 1:08:15.554
- He probably...
- Nothing, garp.

1:08:23.361 --> 1:08:26.364
What's with you fake flirting with
that asshole all the time anyway?

1:08:26.465 --> 1:08:28.768
'Cause I'm saving
your big fat ass!

1:08:32.805 --> 1:08:33.973
Sols...

1:08:37.977 --> 1:08:39.011
Sols!

1:08:41.814 --> 1:08:42.815
Sols!

1:08:44.917 --> 1:08:45.917
Hmm.

1:08:48.420 --> 1:08:49.454
That's nice to hear.

1:08:52.491 --> 1:08:53.659
Them fighting?

1:08:54.794 --> 1:08:56.428
Them fighting like a family.

1:08:57.864 --> 1:08:59.264
Them fighting honestly.

1:09:19.417 --> 1:09:21.754
Is that a gun
or are you happy to see me?

1:09:24.623 --> 1:09:26.793
Oh, I am happy to see you.

1:09:33.633 --> 1:09:35.034
You don't even need our porno?

1:09:38.603 --> 1:09:39.603
You knew?

1:09:40.139 --> 1:09:41.373
Of course.

1:09:47.713 --> 1:09:50.382
Plus, it doesn't seem
like it's a big problem anymore.

1:09:52.084 --> 1:09:54.020
It's plenty big.

1:09:54.921 --> 1:09:56.789
Oh. Okay.

1:10:02.728 --> 1:10:03.728
Stat report.

1:10:05.463 --> 1:10:06.699
Put the red setting on.

1:10:07.566 --> 1:10:08.567
I don't fucking...

1:10:11.804 --> 1:10:12.805
Double sparkle!

1:10:13.438 --> 1:10:14.707
Goddamn it, I never win.

1:10:16.541 --> 1:10:17.810
Victory is mine.

1:10:21.180 --> 1:10:23.082
- Do you want to play again?
- No.

1:10:24.050 --> 1:10:25.550
I wish this was real.

1:10:37.196 --> 1:10:38.965
It sucks
we're the only ones alone.

1:10:39.866 --> 1:10:41.366
We got each other, brother.

1:10:43.102 --> 1:10:47.673
You know, if you weren't
too young for me and my brother

1:10:48.174 --> 1:10:51.677
and gay...
We'd have a good thing going.

1:10:55.580 --> 1:10:56.782
Bottom's up.

1:11:01.187 --> 1:11:02.187
Come on.

1:11:07.727 --> 1:11:09.662
Come on. Just a little?

1:11:20.172 --> 1:11:22.708
You think that was punishment?

1:11:22.742 --> 1:11:26.946
I mean, don't get me wrong, I want to
see you naked, but getting to see you

1:11:26.979 --> 1:11:31.449
bend over like that was almost worth having
to see you put on your clothes afterwards.

1:11:39.759 --> 1:11:42.094
You know, we should totally
meet up after the wedding.

1:11:49.802 --> 1:11:51.671
I would like
to propose a toast...

1:11:54.273 --> 1:11:57.843
To our very own
t. S. Garp gault,

1:11:58.678 --> 1:12:01.981
whom is about to embark on
the journey that is marriage.

1:12:02.081 --> 1:12:03.983
Is that the correct use of whom?

1:12:05.885 --> 1:12:07.585
I'm trying to congratulate you.

1:12:07.687 --> 1:12:10.089
Well, you should try it
with proper English, old man.

1:12:10.189 --> 1:12:11.657
Oh, really?

1:12:13.859 --> 1:12:14.961
Well, garp...

1:12:15.728 --> 1:12:17.529
I want to wish you
the best of luck.

1:12:19.098 --> 1:12:20.598
I want to thank you for this.

1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.903
- For a fake rehearsal dinner?
- Yes.

1:12:26.138 --> 1:12:27.807
For a fake rehearsal dinner.

1:12:30.943 --> 1:12:33.545
- For a fake rehearsal dinner.
- Fake rehearsal dinner!

1:12:33.646 --> 1:12:35.214
- Yeah!
- Cheers, mom.

1:12:42.288 --> 1:12:48.894
I, t. S. Garp gault, take you, scout
Finch, to be my unlawfully wedded wife,

1:12:48.995 --> 1:12:54.166
my constant friend, my faithful
companion and my love

1:12:54.266 --> 1:12:56.268
from this day forward.

1:12:56.302 --> 1:13:01.539
In the presence of the world,
I promise to be your faithful companion...

1:13:02.641 --> 1:13:06.012
In sickness and in health,
in good times and in bad...

1:13:07.113 --> 1:13:09.215
And in joy as well as in sorrow.

1:13:10.116 --> 1:13:12.785
I promise to love you
unconditionally,

1:13:12.885 --> 1:13:15.287
to honor and respect you

1:13:15.988 --> 1:13:18.590
and to laugh with you

1:13:18.691 --> 1:13:23.662
and to cry with you and to Cherish
you for as long as we both shall live.

1:13:25.931 --> 1:13:27.599
I'll tell you guys
what she tippy talks.

1:13:31.337 --> 1:13:34.974
I, scout Finch,
take you, t. S. Garp gault,

1:13:35.674 --> 1:13:40.279
to be my unlawfully wedded
husband, my constant friend,

1:13:41.147 --> 1:13:44.984
my faithful partner and my love
from this day forward.

1:13:45.918 --> 1:13:50.256
In the presence of the world,
I offer you my solemn vow

1:13:51.057 --> 1:13:54.660
to be your faithful partner
in sickness and in health,

1:13:54.760 --> 1:13:56.829
in good times and in bad,

1:13:57.763 --> 1:13:59.932
in joy as well as in sorrow.

1:14:01.033 --> 1:14:04.136
I promise to love you
unconditionally,

1:14:04.770 --> 1:14:10.309
to honor and to respect you,
to laugh with you and to cry with you

1:14:10.843 --> 1:14:13.679
and to Cherish you for as long
as we both shall live.

1:14:15.147 --> 1:14:16.581
And we shall live.

1:14:21.020 --> 1:14:24.290
And by the power
vested in me, by me,

1:14:24.390 --> 1:14:26.892
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1:14:26.992 --> 1:14:28.360
You may kiss the bride!

1:14:28.461 --> 1:14:29.627
Yay!

1:15:32.391 --> 1:15:35.394
Oh, god. Jesus, man.

1:15:35.494 --> 1:15:37.029
Don't knock it
till you tried it.

1:15:39.965 --> 1:15:41.834
- Hey.
- All right. I need your help.

1:15:43.469 --> 1:15:46.749
- I'm gonna cut out my tracking device and go see my wife.
- Are you fucking crazy?

1:15:46.805 --> 1:15:48.884
- We don't even know how those things work.
- Yeah. But we know where

1:15:48.908 --> 1:15:51.844
they are. I was gonna wait for this
one to malfunction like the last one

1:15:51.944 --> 1:15:54.713
but voraz said the battery wouldn't die.
So I'm just gonna cut it out.

1:15:54.813 --> 1:15:57.449
- What if you get caught?
- What if we have to stay in this house

1:15:57.550 --> 1:15:59.985
- for the rest of our lives?
- I don't know, man.

1:16:00.085 --> 1:16:03.055
I do. I need to go see my wife.

1:16:03.155 --> 1:16:04.723
But you connected. We connected.

1:16:04.823 --> 1:16:06.926
Yeah, you did. But I want more.

1:16:07.393 --> 1:16:10.029
Life isn't about just sitting
around letting things be fine.

1:16:10.129 --> 1:16:12.874
It's about going for more. And if
you lose then you know what it's like

1:16:12.898 --> 1:16:14.867
with less and you can
appreciate more more.

1:16:14.967 --> 1:16:17.203
More more.

1:16:17.303 --> 1:16:22.007
Yeah. More more.

1:16:24.476 --> 1:16:26.712
- Are you okay, man?
- No.

1:16:28.147 --> 1:16:30.149
- Will you help me?
- Yeah.

1:16:32.318 --> 1:16:33.318
Thanks.

1:16:37.156 --> 1:16:38.224
I'm gonna cut this out.

1:16:39.391 --> 1:16:41.203
I need you to sit here with
the tracker and stare into.

1:16:41.227 --> 1:16:42.861
Scout's room while I'm gone.

1:16:44.396 --> 1:16:47.499
- What?
- This might be the only circumstance on earth

1:16:47.600 --> 1:16:49.768
where one might ask
their brother to watch them

1:16:49.868 --> 1:16:51.971
have sex
and it be perfectly fine.

1:17:01.113 --> 1:17:04.016
Okay.
Now, I need you to signal me

1:17:04.116 --> 1:17:07.019
if you hear the voice
or if you think anyone's coming.

1:17:07.119 --> 1:17:08.187
What kind of coming?

1:17:09.521 --> 1:17:12.424
- Sorry.
- I don't want scout getting into any kind of trouble.

1:17:12.524 --> 1:17:13.525
- You got me?
- Mm-hmm.

1:17:17.029 --> 1:17:18.030
Okay.

1:17:32.044 --> 1:17:34.213
- Oh, man.
- That's fucking disgusting.

1:17:34.313 --> 1:17:36.982
- What, the puke or the cut?
- Both.

1:17:37.416 --> 1:17:39.018
Hand me that gauze!
Hand me that gauze!

1:17:50.629 --> 1:17:52.031
All right.

1:17:52.498 --> 1:17:54.233
- Love you, man. Good bye.
- Love you too.

1:19:20.486 --> 1:19:21.920
Come back!

1:19:35.702 --> 1:19:38.470
Garp, get inside!
Goddamnit, garp!

1:19:45.377 --> 1:19:48.247
- <i>Your tracking device has been removed.</i>
- Fuck!

1:19:50.482 --> 1:19:51.984
Fuck!

1:19:53.185 --> 1:19:56.155
<i>Your tracking device
has been removed.</i>

1:19:59.291 --> 1:20:03.962
<i>Your tracking device is not at a
temperature condusive to the human body.</i>

1:20:07.332 --> 1:20:10.035
<i>Your tracking device
has been removed.</i>

1:20:10.402 --> 1:20:15.007
<i>Your tracking device is not at a
temperature condusive to the human body.</i>

1:20:31.658 --> 1:20:34.159
It just started beeping.
It just started beeping.

1:20:51.076 --> 1:20:52.611
What's happening, garp?

1:20:54.480 --> 1:20:55.547
What's happening?

1:20:57.349 --> 1:20:58.383
He went to see scout.

1:20:59.051 --> 1:21:00.052
What?

1:21:00.687 --> 1:21:02.254
But I didn't make it!

1:21:04.590 --> 1:21:06.100
- It's okay.
- No, but I didn't make...

1:21:06.124 --> 1:21:09.127
It's okay. It's okay.
Tell him it's okay.

1:21:09.228 --> 1:21:11.530
- It's okay.
- It's... it's okay.

1:21:13.499 --> 1:21:15.400
Augustine, tell him it's okay!

1:21:17.336 --> 1:21:19.238
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

1:21:22.508 --> 1:21:23.643
It's okay.

1:21:38.825 --> 1:21:41.761
T. S. Garp gault.

1:21:48.600 --> 1:21:49.760
Why was your tracker removed?

1:21:57.509 --> 1:22:00.780
No reason suffices.
For breach of contract,

1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:03.783
you are hereby
sentenced to death.

1:22:10.823 --> 1:22:13.525
No reason suffices.

1:22:17.830 --> 1:22:19.231
That about sums it up.

1:22:22.234 --> 1:22:24.136
Hey!

1:22:24.236 --> 1:22:25.304
Oh, shit.

1:22:36.315 --> 1:22:38.350
- Sorry.
- Shut up, dries.

1:22:43.890 --> 1:22:45.090
Any last words?

1:22:52.531 --> 1:22:54.600
Surely that wasn't
a breach of contract.

1:22:54.701 --> 1:22:56.168
Shut up, sols.

1:22:56.268 --> 1:22:58.470
Surely this has just been
a misunderstanding.

1:22:58.570 --> 1:23:02.709
- Shut up, solsbury.
- Garp, shut the hell up. If not for me, then for you know who.

1:23:16.856 --> 1:23:18.123
Yeah, I don't know.

1:23:53.458 --> 1:23:56.863
I can see how this...
Could be an accident.

1:24:06.673 --> 1:24:07.673
Let's go.

1:24:14.681 --> 1:24:15.882
Solsbury...

1:24:17.616 --> 1:24:19.451
Nothing like this
better happen again.

1:24:30.029 --> 1:24:31.596
Solsbury...

1:24:35.300 --> 1:24:36.334
Feel good?

1:25:08.634 --> 1:25:10.435
- Okay. We're gonna do this. Yes.
- Yes.

1:25:10.535 --> 1:25:12.370
Oh, come in here. Come in here.

1:25:12.839 --> 1:25:16.441
No, no, no. Not like that.
No, no, let's just...

1:25:16.943 --> 1:25:18.978
No, no, don't.
Definitely like that!

1:25:19.078 --> 1:25:20.947
- Not like that. Don't do that.
- Yes.

1:25:21.047 --> 1:25:23.247
- Oh, come on! Give me what I want!
- That's disgusting!

1:25:28.921 --> 1:25:31.389
What?
But, baby, that's what I like.

1:25:32.557 --> 1:25:34.559
What did I do?

1:25:35.594 --> 1:25:37.864
I want you so bad,
come back please!

1:25:41.366 --> 1:25:42.367
- Let's go.
- What?

1:25:42.467 --> 1:25:43.467
Now! Let's...

1:25:44.203 --> 1:25:45.938
I'm formally requesting
new esquires

1:25:46.038 --> 1:25:48.306
and a better,
healthier meal plan.

1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:55.380
Did they leave?

1:25:55.480 --> 1:25:56.480
Yes!

1:26:02.021 --> 1:26:05.390
- Fuck, solsbury.
- You owe me so big.

1:26:05.490 --> 1:26:07.459
I thought that you were go...

1:26:07.559 --> 1:26:09.561
No, I love you,
but not that much.

1:26:11.764 --> 1:26:15.067
- Eurgh.
- Go wash your hands first!

1:26:15.168 --> 1:26:17.402
One look. Just look.

1:26:17.970 --> 1:26:18.970
Get off!

1:26:21.841 --> 1:26:23.709
I can't believe
we just got out of that.

1:26:24.043 --> 1:26:25.912
That is so gross!

1:26:27.079 --> 1:26:28.446
Are you okay, darling?

1:26:29.548 --> 1:26:30.650
Yeah, dad.

1:26:34.452 --> 1:26:36.321
Where on god's green earth
did you shit?

1:27:10.957 --> 1:27:12.658
He went so fast!

1:27:13.993 --> 1:27:15.828
You had me so scared there,
old boy.

1:27:18.965 --> 1:27:20.666
Get up, you jerk.

1:27:26.504 --> 1:27:27.504
Garp?

1:27:28.841 --> 1:27:29.841
Garp?

1:27:30.977 --> 1:27:32.477
What's wrong?

1:27:32.577 --> 1:27:35.380
Garp?

1:27:35.480 --> 1:27:37.149
- Garp?
- Garp?

1:27:37.250 --> 1:27:38.583
Quit messing around.

1:27:40.887 --> 1:27:42.121
Oh, fuck, garp.

1:27:43.656 --> 1:27:44.657
What is it?

1:27:45.057 --> 1:27:46.057
Garp?

1:27:47.827 --> 1:27:48.827
Garp?

1:27:50.062 --> 1:27:51.931
Hey, garp? Garp?

1:27:54.066 --> 1:27:55.735
- Come on, get him up.
- Garp?

1:27:55.835 --> 1:27:57.637
Oh, god. Oh, god.

1:27:59.772 --> 1:28:03.776
- God, no!
- What is it? What is it?

1:28:05.244 --> 1:28:08.014
Get up.

1:28:08.681 --> 1:28:09.815
Would you quit it?

1:28:28.834 --> 1:28:30.069
Wake up!

1:28:31.737 --> 1:28:33.806
Wake up! Wake up!

1:28:46.551 --> 1:28:48.888
- Come on!
- Wake up!

1:28:48.988 --> 1:28:51.691
He doesn't have a pulse.
Do you know how to fix that?

1:28:53.292 --> 1:28:55.094
I'm not too nervous.
I can't feel it either.

1:28:55.194 --> 1:28:57.629
He doesn't have one.
Do you know how to fix?

1:29:18.751 --> 1:29:20.820
I'm so sorry.

1:29:23.856 --> 1:29:28.661
No! No! Oh, my god.

1:29:30.129 --> 1:29:31.563
Oh, no!

1:29:37.703 --> 1:29:42.607
Please! Help! Help me!

1:30:26.285 --> 1:30:30.956
No! No, please!

1:30:36.062 --> 1:30:38.764
<i>When you are the
controller of the world,</i>

1:30:38.864 --> 1:30:41.033
<i>you and you alone
can handle this.</i>

1:30:41.133 --> 1:30:42.902
<i>- Make this happen.
- Please, sir.</i>

1:30:43.002 --> 1:30:45.838
<i>There's no way we'll get these
ratifications taken care of.</i>

1:30:45.938 --> 1:30:49.308
Well, it looks like ratifications
will take at least another month.

1:30:53.212 --> 1:30:55.147
How are we supposed
to watch the news, dad?

1:30:55.815 --> 1:30:56.916
There is no news.

1:31:00.820 --> 1:31:02.340
What do you think
about this, solsbury?

1:31:04.824 --> 1:31:05.824
I love it.

1:31:12.164 --> 1:31:15.935
Would you leave your brothers
goddamn body alone?

1:31:17.069 --> 1:31:18.069
No.

1:31:22.675 --> 1:31:23.776
God.

1:31:28.080 --> 1:31:29.648
He just lost his son.

1:31:30.216 --> 1:31:33.819
And so did you.
And we just lost our brother.

1:31:34.687 --> 1:31:36.922
But the brother we got to know
wouldn't want me to mope.

1:31:37.022 --> 1:31:41.327
He'd want me to take the lesson and
that it'd make me feel more and more.

1:31:45.898 --> 1:31:48.134
I just can't wait
for the lawyers to get here.

1:31:50.002 --> 1:31:51.002
What?

1:31:52.138 --> 1:31:54.807
- They'll probably get rid of his fucking body.
- Language.

1:31:55.307 --> 1:31:58.043
Mom, we are so past that.

1:32:00.246 --> 1:32:02.248
- And that body fucking smells.
- Wa...

1:32:06.952 --> 1:32:07.952
Never mind.

1:32:19.231 --> 1:32:21.066
Any ratification requests?

1:32:23.836 --> 1:32:27.239
You are taking the body, right?

1:32:29.008 --> 1:32:31.777
I'm sorry. That is
not in our contract.

1:32:38.751 --> 1:32:39.751
What?

1:32:40.986 --> 1:32:43.923
That is not in our contract.

1:32:46.158 --> 1:32:47.860
- Would you like to file...
- Get out.

1:32:48.394 --> 1:32:51.864
Get the fuck out
of our house now!

1:33:02.074 --> 1:33:03.074
One more thing...

1:33:09.848 --> 1:33:13.452
I would like to put in for new esquires
into better, healthier food plan.

1:33:15.054 --> 1:33:16.054
Noted.

1:33:54.860 --> 1:33:56.500
I can't look at
this fucking body anymore.

1:34:00.499 --> 1:34:03.535
- If we take it outside, our trackers will go off.
- Then let them go off.

1:34:10.075 --> 1:34:12.344
Sweetheart. Sweetheart.

1:34:12.444 --> 1:34:16.315
I know I've been upset and angry,
but I can't stand losing you too.

1:34:16.415 --> 1:34:19.184
Then don't, dad, I can't move
his body by myself.

1:34:20.919 --> 1:34:21.919
I'm going to help.

1:34:25.557 --> 1:34:26.825
Thanks, mom.

1:34:27.626 --> 1:34:29.295
This is insane!

1:34:29.595 --> 1:34:31.263
What are you talking about?

1:34:31.363 --> 1:34:34.433
We're talking about going
outside with the big fellow.

1:34:34.533 --> 1:34:38.370
Yeah, dad.
I'm talking about going out.

1:34:38.470 --> 1:34:41.974
- Don't you just want to go outside?
- The fresh air sounds grand.

1:34:42.274 --> 1:34:44.009
You can't kill yourselves.

1:34:44.109 --> 1:34:46.412
Dad, not doing what
we want to get what we want

1:34:46.512 --> 1:34:48.480
to return is killing ourselves.

1:34:48.580 --> 1:34:50.049
I want people to go outside.

1:34:50.149 --> 1:34:51.950
So I'm going outside.

1:34:56.588 --> 1:34:58.090
We're just going outside?

1:34:58.557 --> 1:35:01.193
Yeah, dad,
we're just going outside.

1:35:14.173 --> 1:35:15.174
Oh, god.

1:35:16.075 --> 1:35:18.110
- Thanks, sweetheart.
- Fucking love you.

1:35:19.111 --> 1:35:20.212
I love you.

1:35:21.513 --> 1:35:22.548
I love you.

1:35:23.949 --> 1:35:25.217
I love you.

1:35:27.119 --> 1:35:28.187
We love you.

1:35:32.491 --> 1:35:34.393
<i>Step away from the exit.</i>

1:35:34.493 --> 1:35:36.862
<i>You are not within
a safe distance from the exit.</i>

1:35:36.962 --> 1:35:38.364
<i>Step away from the exit.</i>

1:35:38.698 --> 1:35:41.066
<i>You are leaving
the legal parameters.</i>

1:35:41.166 --> 1:35:46.438
<i>The legal parameters have been left.
Calmly wait for your esquires.</i>

1:35:46.538 --> 1:35:50.209
<i>You will die. The legal
parameters have been left.</i>

1:35:50.643 --> 1:35:54.213
<i>Calmly wait for your esquires.
You will die.</i>

1:35:54.313 --> 1:35:57.049
<i>The legal
parameters have been left.</i>

1:35:57.549 --> 1:36:01.220
<i>Calmly wait for your esquires.
You will die.</i>

1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:03.555
<i>The legal parameters
have been left.</i>

1:36:04.323 --> 1:36:07.459
<i>Calmly wait for your esquires.
You will die.</i>

1:36:07.559 --> 1:36:09.061
<i>We will live.</i>

1:36:11.130 --> 1:36:14.500
<i>Calmly wait
for your esquires. You will die.</i>

1:36:14.600 --> 1:36:16.669
<i>The legal parameters
have been left.</i>

1:36:17.704 --> 1:36:21.039
<i>Calmly wait for your esquires.
You will die.</i>

1:36:28.614 --> 1:36:31.016
I was just thinking
of something that garp said.

1:36:32.151 --> 1:36:35.521
He said that...
"Life is when you feel."

1:37:09.421 --> 1:37:10.422
Nice.

1:37:12.524 --> 1:37:13.525
Little problem.

1:37:14.426 --> 1:37:15.426
Excuse me!

1:37:17.831 --> 1:37:19.565
For breach of contract...

1:37:20.332 --> 1:37:24.269
You are all sentenced to death.

1:37:27.674 --> 1:37:28.674
Fuck off!

1:37:32.277 --> 1:37:34.580
- Ready?
- Don't touch my fucking shoulder, man.

1:37:34.681 --> 1:37:36.215
Don't touch my fucking shoulder.

1:38:27.366 --> 1:38:31.103
<i>And that's how what
I had really wanted began.</i>

1:38:31.771 --> 1:38:34.774
<i>Families came outside one by one</i>

1:38:34.874 --> 1:38:38.645
<i>like a single fire,
because garp was vulnerable,</i>

1:38:38.745 --> 1:38:41.648
<i>because garp stood naked
in front of the window.</i>

1:38:42.347 --> 1:38:46.451
<i>The entire world is standing
naked in front of their window.</i>

1:38:46.552 --> 1:38:50.188
<i>The entire world was connecting.</i>

1:38:51.858 --> 1:38:55.460
<i>The simple feeling of connection
I wanted years before,</i>

1:38:55.561 --> 1:38:58.196
<i>the feeling I created a drug
that let you live</i>

1:38:58.297 --> 1:38:59.766
<i>your wildest dreams for.</i>

1:39:00.599 --> 1:39:03.569
<i>The feelings
I so desperately wanted.</i>

1:39:04.369 --> 1:39:06.739
<i>The feeling of connection.</i>

1:39:07.907 --> 1:39:10.275
<i>That feeling
wasn't a feeling at all,</i>

1:39:10.375 --> 1:39:11.375
<i>but a truth.</i>

1:39:12.177 --> 1:39:14.747
<i>Whether we feel
connected or not,</i>

1:39:15.581 --> 1:39:18.651
<i>we are connected.
And god knew it.</i>

1:39:19.518 --> 1:39:22.287
<i>It was not technology
in our way.</i>

1:39:22.387 --> 1:39:24.222
<i>No, no, it was us.</i>

1:39:25.858 --> 1:39:31.798
<i>And because garp stood naked in front
of that window, people freed themselves</i>

1:39:31.898 --> 1:39:35.400
<i>because of one man putting
out what he really wanted.</i>

1:39:35.868 --> 1:39:38.470
<i>We all got to share
in something beautiful.</i>

1:39:40.172 --> 1:39:44.811
<i>And even though garp died,
many more people lived...</i>

1:39:46.746 --> 1:39:48.480
<i>By being honest about wanting</i>

1:39:48.580 --> 1:39:51.149
to see a girl naked in a window.

1:39:52.184 --> 1:39:55.888
By being himself, garp rebooted
the entire world.

1:39:56.622 --> 1:39:58.590
The technology, the politics.

1:39:58.691 --> 1:40:00.893
They're all out the window.

1:40:00.927 --> 1:40:07.165
And I hope that is how we will live
without garp. And how I want you to live

1:40:07.867 --> 1:40:08.868
without me.

1:40:12.371 --> 1:40:13.472
Without ward.
