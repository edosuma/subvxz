when he was 28,

just burn down or flood

10:35.983 --> 10:37.158

a thoughtful gesture

10:38.725 --> 10:40.074

Also, if you happen
to have another conversation

10:42.206 --> 10:43.773

buying houses,

maybe you just
keep your mouth shut.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.691

10:48.735 --> 10:50.432
Listen, Anthony not movin'
forward with that house

10:50.475 --> 10:51.868

10:51.912 --> 10:53.435

a little bit to do with me.

he don't want the house.

opportunity for him,

Frederick Douglass
was haunting Wyatt.

15:15.871 --> 15:18.221
After days, he still couldn't
find him in that book.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.049
Can you believe that?
- Thanks, Uncle Wyatt.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.485
- My pleasure, niece-piece.

15:21.529 --> 15:23.792
- So do you wanna play
"Finding Frederick Douglass"

15:23.835 --> 15:27.013
with me?
- How 'bout we give it a rest?

15:27.056 --> 15:28.710
You should be spending more
of your time on books

15:28.753 --> 15:31.147
with words in them,
don't you think?

15:31.191 --> 15:33.193
- I guess.
- Okay.

15:33.236 --> 15:35.238
Well, I have some work
to do in the studio

15:35.282 --> 15:38.111
for a couple of hours, so just
knock if you need me, okay?

15:38.154 --> 15:39.634
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:39.677 --> 15:42.463
[upbeat music]

15:42.506 --> 15:45.945
Okay, Mr. Douglass,
where are you?

15:45.988 --> 15:47.424
- Wyatt couldn't help himself.

15:47.468 --> 15:49.600
At this point, it was bigger
than Frederick Douglass,

15:49.644 --> 15:51.907
so he searched

15:51.951 --> 15:54.605
and he searched...

15:54.649 --> 15:56.607
and he searched.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.174
♪

15:58.218 --> 16:00.437
He even researched.

16:00.481 --> 16:01.699
The man went crazy.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.875
I mean, look at this guy.

16:03.919 --> 16:07.009
And he seemed to come close...

16:07.053 --> 16:09.011
but Frederick Douglass
evaded him yet again.

16:09.055 --> 16:11.013
- Frederick Douglass...

16:11.057 --> 16:14.060
[voice echoing]
Where are you?

16:14.103 --> 16:16.627
- Meanwhile, Sherm had
a big ol' epiphany,

16:16.671 --> 16:19.108
and he was ready to share it
with Anthony and Nicky.

16:19.152 --> 16:21.719
- Anthony, Nicky,
thank you for meeting me.

16:21.763 --> 16:23.199
- What's this about, Sherm?

16:23.243 --> 16:24.505
- Anthony, I think you should
bid on the house.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.681
- Really? What made you
change your mind?

16:26.724 --> 16:28.204
- It came to me in a dream.

16:28.248 --> 16:30.250
- But what about all that stuff
you were saying earlier?

16:30.293 --> 16:33.035
- I had a change of heart,
another classic Sherm 180.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.255
I can see now
I was being selfish.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.561
- Are you sure this had nothing
to do with the conversation

16:37.605 --> 16:39.259
we had earlier?
- No.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.304
Anthony, you a VP
at an accounting firm.

16:41.348 --> 16:42.784
You got more savings
than the whole crew.

16:42.827 --> 16:45.134
You're ready for this.
- That's exactly what I said.

16:45.178 --> 16:48.094
Give me some credit.
- No. It came to me in a dream.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.790
- Was I in the dream?
- Nicky, these thoughts

16:49.834 --> 16:50.966
are coming to me in real time.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.054
If you could please
stop interrupting.

16:52.098 --> 16:53.577
- You know,
I've always fantasized

16:53.621 --> 16:55.318
about having two offices,

16:55.362 --> 16:57.929
one for business
and one for pleasure.

16:57.973 --> 16:59.670
- See, that's insane,
but you deserve it.

16:59.714 --> 17:01.629
And I don't wanna see you die
in our apartment.

17:01.672 --> 17:02.978
- Yeah, I don't know what
that's about.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.153
- Hey, Nicky,
is there still time

17:04.196 --> 17:05.328
to bid on that house?
- Yes.

17:05.372 --> 17:06.329
They're accepting
counteroffers,

17:06.373 --> 17:08.114
but it's gonna be competitive.

17:08.156 --> 17:10.550
- Then let's compete!
[laughs] I'm back in.

17:10.594 --> 17:13.510
- Yes, and Nicky,
please don't screw this up.

17:13.554 --> 17:15.338
- But you're the one
that almost screwed it up.

17:15.382 --> 17:17.165
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.994
- Why is your memory
so selective?

17:21.953 --> 17:22.127
.

17:22.171 --> 17:25.131
[phone ringing]

17:25.174 --> 17:26.435
- Hey, Nicky. Sup?

17:26.480 --> 17:27.655
- Don't you "Nicky" me.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.439
I heard every word
you said about me,

17:29.483 --> 17:31.006
you bitch.
- Huh?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.268
Nicky, this is Anthony.

17:32.312 --> 17:34.096
- Oops, sorry.
That was a misdial.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.968
But hey, I was gonna call you
after I called my enemy.

17:37.012 --> 17:39.623
Look, we're down
to best and final offers,

17:39.667 --> 17:41.495
so you're gonna have
to put up some more money

17:41.538 --> 17:43.453
if you wanna get the house.
- [groans]

17:43.497 --> 17:45.673
I can't go much higher
than where we're at.

17:45.716 --> 17:48.502
I'm already pushin' it.
- Okay. I understand.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.069
- This just isn't the one,
I guess.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.984
- Yeah, but listen, I will
find you something, I promise.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.551
There are other homes
out there.

17:54.595 --> 17:56.597
- Okay. Thanks.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.816
- All right, bye.
- Peace.

17:58.860 --> 18:01.471
- And while Anthony's search
for a home came to a halt,

18:01.515 --> 18:03.256
Wyatt's obsession
with Frederick Douglass

18:03.299 --> 18:05.475
was affecting his relationship
with little Nadine.

18:05.519 --> 18:06.824
- Hey, Nadine.
Whatcha got there?

18:06.868 --> 18:08.391
- Nothing.

18:08.435 --> 18:09.958
- Nadine, you know you don't
have to hide stuff from me.

18:10.001 --> 18:11.177
What is it?

18:11.220 --> 18:12.743
- It's drugs.
- What? What?

18:12.787 --> 18:13.918
Dru--

18:13.962 --> 18:15.659
[groans]

18:15.703 --> 18:17.444
It's just
"Finding Frederick Douglass."

18:17.487 --> 18:18.793
Why would you tell me
it's drugs?

18:18.836 --> 18:20.664
- I don't know. I panicked.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.753
It's just
I know you hate the book.

18:22.797 --> 18:24.755
I thought drugs would
stress you out less.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.366
- Well, I--I don't--
I don't hate the book.

18:26.409 --> 18:28.977
It's just I'm very, very bad
at it.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.500
- I usually do this book

18:30.544 --> 18:32.241
every night before bed
with my mom,

18:32.285 --> 18:33.938
and I wanted
to play it with you

18:33.982 --> 18:35.897
because you're
my favorite uncle.

18:38.204 --> 18:41.729
- I am so sorry, Nadine.

18:41.772 --> 18:44.253
I didn't mean to keep you
from this book.

18:44.297 --> 18:47.430
And it doesn't even matter
if I'm terrible at it.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.694
You know what?

18:50.738 --> 18:52.696
Let's play.
- Okay.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.045
Thanks, Uncle Weezy.
- [chuckles]

18:56.222 --> 18:57.701
[chill music]

18:57.745 --> 18:59.225
- Do you see Frederick Douglass
yet?

18:59.268 --> 19:03.054
- Of course not.
[both laugh]

19:03.098 --> 19:05.144
- Anthony!
- Ow!

19:05.187 --> 19:07.494
Who slaps somebody in the back
of the head?

19:07.537 --> 19:09.060
- Me. I do.

19:09.104 --> 19:10.192
I've got great news.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.063
You got the house.
- What?

19:12.107 --> 19:13.282
- The owner,
she changed her mind.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.023
- For real? Why?
- Well, apparently,

19:15.066 --> 19:16.938
your current
and soon-to-be former roommate

19:16.981 --> 19:18.853
wrote a very convincing letter.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.724
- Sherm made this happen?
- Yeah.

19:20.768 --> 19:23.162
- Wow.
- The house is yours.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.859
Congrats!
- We did it!

19:24.902 --> 19:26.730
- [laughs]
- Oh, you're the best.

19:26.774 --> 19:28.558
- And after some serious work
in the gym,

19:28.602 --> 19:31.082
I was ready to go the distance
with the Google engineer.

19:31.126 --> 19:33.433
- Hey, so I wanted
to talk to you.

19:33.476 --> 19:34.651
- About the sex? Oh.

19:34.695 --> 19:36.871
I--I know I asked
for shorter sessions,

19:36.914 --> 19:40.048
but I am totally prepared
to go long again.

19:40.091 --> 19:42.442
[both laugh]
- Okay, well, that's great.

19:42.485 --> 19:45.575
But Noah, what you said about

19:45.619 --> 19:48.274
not avoiding
uncomfortable conversations...

19:48.317 --> 19:50.841
it kind of inspired me
to face what I want head-on.

19:50.885 --> 19:52.321
- That's great. What's up?

19:52.365 --> 19:54.236
- Well...

19:54.280 --> 19:57.805
I really like you
and I wanna be your girlfriend.

19:57.848 --> 19:59.372
- So Jordan wanted
to go the distance

19:59.415 --> 20:01.852
in the bedroom and out,
and in that moment,

20:01.896 --> 20:04.028
I had to search myself.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.508
Old Noah would be
doing backflips

20:05.552 --> 20:06.944
and picking out baby names.

20:06.988 --> 20:09.208
I'm sorry, but...

20:09.251 --> 20:11.035
that's just not
where I'm at right now.

20:11.079 --> 20:12.950
But these were
different times.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.256
- Oh, okay.

20:14.300 --> 20:17.085
Well, I thought we were vibing.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.130
I fixed your computer.

20:19.174 --> 20:20.044
You spent the night.

20:20.088 --> 20:22.786
I don't do that with everyone.

20:22.830 --> 20:25.224
Um, but, you know, it's cool,
yeah.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.790
- Jordan, I'm sorry.

20:26.834 --> 20:29.663
I--I guess I should get going.

20:31.055 --> 20:33.536
- Hey, do you wanna have sex
all night one last time?

20:33.580 --> 20:35.016
- Fo' sho.

20:35.059 --> 20:35.886
both: Mmm.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.148
- I had been wondering

20:37.192 --> 20:38.672
for a long time
if I could get back

20:38.715 --> 20:40.717
into the dating scene
without committing too fast,

20:40.761 --> 20:43.285
and I finally had my answer.

20:43.329 --> 20:47.115
Five hours later, Jordan and I
officially stopped dating.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.160
[upbeat music]

20:49.204 --> 20:51.337
It felt like a new day
for all of us,

20:51.380 --> 20:53.861
and like we were all searching
for something.

20:57.038 --> 20:59.649
both: And we were starting
to find it.

21:03.349 --> 21:06.090
We were also reaffirming
aspects of our lives...

21:06.134 --> 21:07.831
- That we had wanted
for a long time.

21:12.140 --> 21:14.490
And hacking Noah's cloud and
reading his private journal

21:14.534 --> 21:17.145
has made me realize
that maybe I should search

21:17.188 --> 21:20.061
a little bit less.

21:20.104 --> 21:22.498
I guess we're all
a work in progress.

21:22.542 --> 21:24.544
- Yeah.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.720
- Not a doctor. Shh.
