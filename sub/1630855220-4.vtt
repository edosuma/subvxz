<i>Lesson number eight.</i>

01:17.800 --> 01:20.160
<i>It's not only the degenerates
who like to snort.</i>

01:20.840 --> 01:23.400
<i>That kind judge
that let you go with just a warning.</i>

01:23.920 --> 01:27.880
<i>The personal trainer that believes
that he has Jesus Christ in his heart.</i>

01:27.880 --> 01:29.240
Come on! Come on!

TURN OF THE TIDE

02:28.000 --> 02:31.480
- Detective Frias, your cell phone is off.
- You came here just to tell me that?

02:31.480 --> 02:33.720
The Regional Superintendent
has summoned you.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.720
- What does he want?
- To talk about the case.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.040
- I don't report to the Regional Super--
- It's a courtesy.

02:38.040 --> 02:40.120
And it'll sit well
with the local authorities.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.120
At the Micaelense Club!

02:43.920 --> 02:44.920
Formal attire!

02:53.520 --> 02:54.720
I'm returning this one.

02:55.720 --> 02:59.440
The beginning is a bit shitty,
but then it has an interesting twist.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.640
Very well. Thank you, Joan.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.840
I don't want to see anyone else
this afternoon, okay?

03:20.440 --> 03:23.440
It's all here.
So, let's schedule your father's surgery.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.600
That's a plan.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.240
Hello?

03:37.080 --> 03:38.120
Sure, I'll be there.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.200
The Superintendent will have to wait.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.200
<i>Lesson number 13.</i>

04:43.800 --> 04:45.960
<i>Collateral effects of snorting blow...</i>

04:45.960 --> 04:47.320
Holy mother of God!

04:47.320 --> 04:49.520
<i>...ego trips,
delusions of grandeur.</i>

04:49.520 --> 04:52.400
<i>Inside every coke addict,
there's a killer bullfighter</i>

04:52.400 --> 04:54.240
<i>who's never stepped into the ring.</i>

04:54.800 --> 04:57.600
Sandrinho, yes, sir!
Our new fucking champion!

04:57.600 --> 05:00.840
Your first gig in Rabo de Peixe
will go down in fucking history!

05:00.840 --> 05:04.320
I've already had the posters made
and pasted. The stage is here!

05:04.320 --> 05:06.040
- Huh?
- Oh, Rafael, man.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.920
I came here--
I came to see my family, man.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.840
Thanks for lunch,
but I didn't come here to do shows, man.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.520
- And I don't have my manager.
- I'll be your manager, Sandro.

05:14.520 --> 05:17.280
I'd like to gift your unborn son
a nice chunk of change.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.840
Let's conquer the fucking continent!

05:18.840 --> 05:21.760
We'll go to America, we'll be playing
the Premier League together!

05:22.600 --> 05:23.560
Yeah, man, but, uh--

05:23.560 --> 05:25.280
No buts, man! We're in this together.

05:25.280 --> 05:28.480
Sandrinho, we're gonna make you
the most famous guy from the Azores.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.320
Even more famous than fucking Nelly!
I rented all this shit for you.

05:31.320 --> 05:36.000
But that's some bullshit karaoke machine.
You can't do a-- a show with that, champ.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.880
I already told you.
I didn't come here to do any show, man.

05:45.920 --> 05:49.440
Two... thousand... dollars.

05:53.080 --> 05:56.000
Sandrinho, me, you,

05:56.880 --> 06:00.000
and this beautiful chick here
with pink hair,

06:00.600 --> 06:03.600
we'll put Rabo de Peixe
on the fucking map, motherfucker!

06:03.600 --> 06:05.000
- Hmm?
- Fuck yeah, man!

06:05.000 --> 06:06.800
- Fuck yeah?
- Fuck yeah!

06:06.800 --> 06:08.920
Fuck yeah!

06:08.920 --> 06:10.280
- Fuck yeah!
- Fuck yeah!

07:12.120 --> 07:13.000
What's wrong?

07:13.720 --> 07:14.680
Are you all right?

07:18.960 --> 07:22.640
I got a call from the hospital.
They've scheduled your surgery.

07:27.320 --> 07:28.640
I thought it was in three months.

07:30.640 --> 07:33.080
Yeah, but they said the wait's too long
for the public hospital,

07:33.080 --> 07:34.600
so you're going to a private clinic.

07:34.600 --> 07:35.520
Mmm.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.520
How much is that gonna cost?

07:37.520 --> 07:39.600
Nothing! You'll have
the surgery at the clinic,

07:39.600 --> 07:42.000
but it's still paid for
by the public health service.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.680
You sure all of this was aboveboard?

07:47.400 --> 07:48.560
Yes, I'm sure, Dad.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.800
Everything's gonna be okay.
You can trust me.

08:10.840 --> 08:13.640
The fingerprints
weren't found in the database.

08:14.640 --> 08:15.760
Looking at the cut,

08:16.360 --> 08:19.200
we know that the forearm
was severed with some kind of ax.

08:19.840 --> 08:22.640
Fractures of the phalanges,
the metacarpal, and the radius.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.200
Was it torture?

08:26.200 --> 08:27.920
I would say a violent impact.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.360
When you add that to this,

08:29.360 --> 08:32.960
which was embedded in the finger,
it is safe to assume he was run over.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.960
They make windshields
to shatter in a specific way.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.200
Do you have the photos, Doctor?

08:46.480 --> 08:47.720
Thank you.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.320
My daughter picked them out.

08:58.560 --> 08:59.560
Thanks.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.520
- Detective, can I come in?
- Yes.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.040
Are your little feet better?

09:10.560 --> 09:12.440
The Italian police have already answered.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.280
Gianluca Rossi,

09:14.280 --> 09:16.800
nephew of the Sicilian Mafia godfather,
Massimo Occhipinti.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.280
It makes sense
that he'd get a tattoo of a centipede.

09:19.280 --> 09:22.200
Several witnesses say
that they saw this man with Bonino.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.400
I thought he'd gotten away,

09:24.400 --> 09:26.480
but he's certainly been dead
for a while now.

09:26.480 --> 09:27.800
The question is why.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.240
Francesco Bonino lost the drugs,

09:30.240 --> 09:32.920
and Gianluca, as a witness,
became a threat.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.120
On the contrary.

09:34.800 --> 09:38.080
Gianluca was the Mafia godfather's nephew,
so he wasn't a threat.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.000
He was loyal.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.160
Who else would have a motive
to kill him then?

09:41.960 --> 09:43.800
Someone who wanted to keep the drugs.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.400
But for now, let's forget the "who"

09:48.800 --> 09:50.480
and let's think about the "how."

09:51.080 --> 09:51.920
Okay.

09:51.920 --> 09:55.360
According to the coroner,
this arm indicates being run over.

09:56.600 --> 09:59.640
Yeah. The weapon is a car. Makes sense.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.760
And what would you do
to make sure that no one knew about it?

10:02.760 --> 10:05.920
I had a friend in college
who crashed into a tree while dead drunk.

10:05.920 --> 10:09.160
<i>He left the car there
and split like nothing happened.</i>

10:09.160 --> 10:12.360
The next day, he reported
the theft at the police station.

10:13.960 --> 10:14.800
I'm on it.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.520
Yep.

10:19.560 --> 10:22.160
She was married.
The husband would beat her all the time,

10:22.160 --> 10:23.560
a real mess.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.400
One day, the wife decides
to divorce the husband,

10:26.400 --> 10:28.600
and puts an ad in the newspaper.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.960
"Respectable woman is looking
for a man who won't beat her up,

10:31.960 --> 10:33.800
and who is also good in bed."

10:33.800 --> 10:35.520
One day, the doorbell rings--

10:35.520 --> 10:37.720
Any news about the rest of the drugs?

10:37.720 --> 10:39.640
Excuse me.

10:41.520 --> 10:45.120
Despite the success of the raid,
Detective Mainland thinks we missed some.

10:45.640 --> 10:46.840
One day, the doorbell rings--

10:46.840 --> 10:50.120
Isn't whoever finishes the coffee
supposed to make a fresh pot?

10:51.720 --> 10:54.320
That was me. Apologies, detective.

10:56.680 --> 10:58.560
One day, the doorbell rings...

10:59.640 --> 11:01.040
...and it was a cripple.

11:01.040 --> 11:03.400
With no arms, no legs.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.920
And he says, "Good morning,
I came in response to the ad."

11:05.920 --> 11:09.480
"As you can see the state I'm in,
uh, I can't beat anyone."

11:09.480 --> 11:12.880
And the wife says, "But I also asked
for a man that was good in bed."

11:12.880 --> 11:15.240
And the cripple says,
"Well, lady,

11:15.240 --> 11:17.040
how do you think I rang the bell?"

11:19.360 --> 11:21.280
Bring us a bottle of champagne.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.000
And a platter
of fried dicks with gay sauce.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.760
- For our friend here please.
- Awesome, guys.

11:26.760 --> 11:29.280
Shh! I have here Eduardo's order.

11:29.280 --> 11:32.040
- Huh?
- Ooh, ooh, ooh-hoo!

11:32.040 --> 11:34.640
- They've all been charged, yep.
- Charged, yes.

11:35.480 --> 11:38.320
- I put my number in yours.
- So I can just call you up?

11:38.320 --> 11:40.120
Or should I worry
about your other boyfriend?

11:40.120 --> 11:44.040
Since we're in a gift-giving mood,
I too bought you a little trinket.

11:44.040 --> 11:46.440
- Carlinhos?
- Ah! Showtime!

11:46.440 --> 11:48.240
- It's something special.
- Drumroll.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.800
Oh, yeah!

11:49.800 --> 11:52.000
Memorize this name. Sandro G.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.560
- Sandro G!
- He's goin' down in Azores' history.

11:54.560 --> 11:59.920
And I,
this businessman, this entrepreneur...

12:01.200 --> 12:02.640
was the first to invest in him.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.800
Hey, big shot. I don't believe we've met.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.000
Thank you very much.
Very nice to meet you.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.040
Nice to meet you.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.000
- Who will do the honors?
- Here!

12:19.880 --> 12:21.960
There's no need
to apologize

12:21.960 --> 12:24.040
for having stood me up this morning.

12:24.040 --> 12:27.560
We, the Azoreans, are used
to waiting for mainlanders.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.200
It took 400 years,

12:31.200 --> 12:32.840
more than 400 years,

12:32.840 --> 12:35.960
until a Portuguese king
deigned to visit the archipelago.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.440
Mr. Superintendent,
I came here to solve a case,

12:38.440 --> 12:39.760
not to learn about history.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.840
I'm not so sure

12:41.840 --> 12:45.560
that your nickname among the local cops
does you justice at all.

12:46.160 --> 12:49.640
You have... a thunderous nature.

12:50.880 --> 12:53.160
- But you didn't let me finish my point.
- Anything else, sir?

12:53.160 --> 12:54.240
No, thanks.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.800
The idea of the Azores
against the mainland

12:58.800 --> 13:01.160
may even be a romantic idea,

13:01.160 --> 13:03.120
but it so happens that I'm pragmatic.

13:03.720 --> 13:06.480
Our future economy
is not focused on fisheries,

13:06.480 --> 13:07.640
but on tourism.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.640
Therefore,

13:09.640 --> 13:12.960
we cannot be associated
with drug trafficking, all right?

13:13.560 --> 13:16.480
I spoke with the Secretary
of the Interior in Lisbon on this matter,

13:16.480 --> 13:17.440
and he agrees.

13:18.320 --> 13:19.520
That being said,

13:19.520 --> 13:22.680
if you're incapable of closing this case
and controlling the local cops,

13:23.480 --> 13:26.320
you'll be replaced by someone who can,
Detective Frias.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.600
On that note, have a good night.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.360
- How are you?
- Hi.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.480
Whiskey? The meeting must have gone well.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.160
What's my nickname, Francisco?

13:45.160 --> 13:47.320
You know what cops are like.
It's just talk.

13:48.680 --> 13:50.160
Tell me. What's my nickname?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.840
Paula Frigid. It's a play on your name.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.480
Frigid, Frias.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.000
Frigid.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.360
Detective, they call me "Parakeet."

14:02.360 --> 14:04.480
Because I always have
something else to say.

14:04.480 --> 14:07.360
A nickname can also be seen
as a compliment, you know?

14:07.360 --> 14:09.000
That's it. See it as a compliment.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.760
Thank you, Francisco.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.800
I'm nervous.

14:34.480 --> 14:37.480
Think about the first thing
you want to see after your operation.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.320
I don't know, son.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.600
I don't remember
what the world looks like.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.480
I'm extremely sorry about the delay,
but Dr. Mamede had...

14:48.040 --> 14:49.200
a minor health problem.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.600
What's that noise?

14:54.400 --> 14:55.760
It's the alarm from my watch.

14:57.720 --> 15:00.560
The surgery will instead be performed
by Dr. Noronha.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.200
Will you come with me, Mr. Melo?

15:03.800 --> 15:04.640
Dad,

15:05.680 --> 15:07.400
it's going to be all right, okay?

15:08.480 --> 15:10.240
I'll wait here 'til you come out.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.240
You-- You're a good son.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.280
All right.

15:38.520 --> 15:39.720
Hello?

15:39.720 --> 15:43.960
<i>Our contact at Interpol
has located the owner of the car.</i>

16:03.400 --> 16:06.240
Tell me if you recognize
the owner of the stolen car, detective.

16:06.800 --> 16:07.640
No.

16:07.640 --> 16:10.120
How about the person
who filed the complaint?

16:11.560 --> 16:13.280
Good morning, dayflowers.

16:14.920 --> 16:18.240
It's just my father's blindness
has always been a cross to bear, you know?

16:19.720 --> 16:21.400
I think that now,
with this business thing,

16:21.400 --> 16:22.960
it could be handy. I mean...

16:23.480 --> 16:25.720
what the eye doesn't see,
the heart doesn't grieve over.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.760
You know that old phrase,
"Be careful what you wish for"?

16:29.760 --> 16:31.840
That's the situation I find myself in.

16:33.080 --> 16:36.120
I have a habit of wishing
without being careful.

16:39.280 --> 16:42.320
But tell me. What do you desire most?

16:45.680 --> 16:47.800
What I really want is to go to America.

16:49.720 --> 16:50.560
Then go.

16:51.280 --> 16:52.960
It's not that simple, Bruna.

16:55.520 --> 16:58.120
What was the first thing you did
with the cash you earned?

16:59.080 --> 17:00.240
I paid for my dad's surgery.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.400
So, your father's gonna see again
because of you.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.080
You don't owe anyone. Quite the opposite.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.560
- What if he finds out what I'm up to, huh?
- Hey, Eduardo!

17:13.160 --> 17:16.440
It's about time for you
to take a bite of what's rightfully yours.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.000
Be it here, or in America.

17:29.520 --> 17:30.840
I said "take a bite."

17:39.800 --> 17:42.960
We have an hour to kill.
What do you want to do?

17:45.080 --> 17:49.280
Because of you,
half the fucking island's mad at me now.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.840
Why? Because the fucking order's spoiled,
you shithead!

17:51.840 --> 17:53.400
Fuck your mother.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.040
Oh, yeah?

17:57.080 --> 17:58.760
What did you cut into the cocaine, hmm?

17:59.760 --> 18:01.680
It's a product I ordered
from America. Why?

18:19.040 --> 18:20.680
<i>Lesson number nine.</i>

18:21.320 --> 18:22.880
<i>How to cut the product.</i>

18:23.720 --> 18:26.160
<i>You have to mix
pure cocaine with something,</i>

18:26.160 --> 18:29.160
<i>so that one kilo becomes three or four.</i>

18:29.680 --> 18:30.880
<i>Or maybe even five.</i>

18:31.720 --> 18:35.040
<i>Use painkillers,
talcum powder, or creatine.</i>

18:35.840 --> 18:39.120
<i>But never use something
that will hurt your customers.</i>

18:44.760 --> 18:45.760
Is that right?

18:47.080 --> 18:48.760
Laxatives?

18:48.760 --> 18:51.080
God bless him.

18:51.880 --> 18:52.880
So good-looking.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.360
You moronic fucking bastard.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.880
You moronic motherfucker!

19:02.880 --> 19:06.040
Now, since the little boy is an idiot
and the little boy fucked up,

19:06.040 --> 19:08.440
do you know what's gonna happen?
You take the little fishes,

19:08.440 --> 19:09.600
you throw them all away.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.600
- And I lose a boatload of money.
- You're damn right!

19:12.600 --> 19:15.240
You're the one who'll lose the money,
asshole, I won't lose a dime.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.760
Who fucked it up? The little boy here.

19:17.760 --> 19:20.840
If it was little boy that fucked up,
the little boy pays for the shit he makes.

19:20.840 --> 19:21.920
Understand me?

19:22.840 --> 19:23.880
Let's talk.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.240
You're really good.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.920
Hmm. You want something to drink?

19:35.920 --> 19:37.920
No? Fucking shit.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.280
Rafael, gimme that.

19:42.280 --> 19:43.920
- That's mine! Give it back!
- Stop.

19:44.640 --> 19:46.440
Very pretty indeed, sir.

19:47.120 --> 19:50.520
But if you think to be a pageant winner,
you just have to have a pretty face...

19:50.520 --> 19:53.560
...or a bikini, and dye
your hair pink, you're fucking mistaken.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.080
You'll have to give
a ton of blow jobs to get anywhere.

19:58.600 --> 20:02.040
Is that what it took to play
in Santa Clara? Giving blow jobs?

20:02.040 --> 20:03.440
Huh.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.680
I was wondering.

20:12.680 --> 20:13.520
Hey...

20:14.600 --> 20:16.360
do you have nude photos of your woman?

20:18.160 --> 20:19.000
No.

20:19.840 --> 20:20.800
Want some?

20:21.960 --> 20:22.840
No.

20:25.560 --> 20:26.400
Sílvia!

20:28.080 --> 20:30.000
I think it's time to take this up a notch.

20:31.040 --> 20:31.960
That's right.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.240
This fucking shit never happens to me.
Come on!

20:41.160 --> 20:42.040
Fuck.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.320
Come on, gimme a kiss.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.960
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Not even a kiss? Where you going?

20:57.960 --> 20:59.840
I'm going home.
I haven't been to bed in days.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.640
- Give me a kiss--
- Let me fucking go!

21:07.680 --> 21:09.080
Fuck.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.440
Fucking cunt!

21:19.720 --> 21:21.000
Baby, you came back--

21:21.000 --> 21:22.440
Champ, what the fuck?

21:23.520 --> 21:24.840
"Sandro Jeans"?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.280
It's fucking Sandro G, motherfucker!

21:29.320 --> 21:30.920
Are you fucking kidding me?

21:32.880 --> 21:34.880
No, stop, stop, stop. Pull over there.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.600
Go over there and buy
whatever the motherfucking kids

21:44.600 --> 21:46.000
are fucking selling.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.520
Take this.

22:03.720 --> 22:04.640
Okay.

22:05.680 --> 22:08.320
- Put your hand up, okay?
- Is it absolutely necessary?

22:08.320 --> 22:10.480
Oh, come on, put your hand here like this.

22:10.480 --> 22:13.360
How the fuck do you expect me
to know whether this shit is kitchen salt

22:13.360 --> 22:14.520
or fucking blow?

22:14.520 --> 22:15.520
Take it.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.360
- Mmm, fuck, it's really coke.
- Exactly.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.920
- It's coke.
- All right.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.080
Hey, boy! Come here.

22:31.880 --> 22:32.960
Get in.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.400
You gonna make me get out
to grab you by the balls

22:36.400 --> 22:37.880
and put you in the fucking car?

22:39.240 --> 22:41.160
- I need to go to the bathroom.
- Shut up.

22:43.480 --> 22:44.400
Tell me.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.520
Where did you get this, boy?

22:50.400 --> 22:51.600
I can't remember.

22:52.440 --> 22:53.480
Take this.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.760
Are you kidding? What about now?

22:58.760 --> 23:00.560
Where did you get this shit, motherfucker?

23:00.560 --> 23:03.080
- You hear me?
- I really think I'm gonna shit my pants.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.200
What's your problem?

23:05.200 --> 23:06.720
Oh!

23:07.600 --> 23:09.960
Oh, look, look, look!
He's shitting himself!

23:16.040 --> 23:18.280
Did you see that? He shitted himself!

23:26.080 --> 23:29.040
As my mother says,
"Cleanliness is next to godliness."

23:30.040 --> 23:30.880
Good afternoon.

23:30.880 --> 23:34.120
- And the men, don't they do anything?
- Who do you think goes out to sea?

23:43.840 --> 23:44.840
Holy Christ.

23:45.360 --> 23:46.320
I just don't understand

23:46.320 --> 23:48.680
why you didn't tell your father
the car had been stolen.

23:48.680 --> 23:51.160
- After all, he's the owner.
- On paper.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.920
He hasn't driven in years.
I drive the car now.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.440
Hmm.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.240
So, does your son
normally lie under pressure?

24:01.320 --> 24:02.800
My son doesn't lie.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.400
He must've forgot to tell you then.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.560
Do you know this man?

24:09.720 --> 24:10.560
- No.
- No?

24:10.560 --> 24:11.840
Mm-mmm. No.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.520
What is this all about?

24:13.520 --> 24:16.160
The photo I showed your son
is that of an Italian trafficker

24:16.160 --> 24:18.760
who disappeared in Rabo de Peixe
at the exact same time

24:18.760 --> 24:20.400
your son reported the theft.

24:21.240 --> 24:23.000
Was it the Italian who stole the car?

24:23.000 --> 24:26.320
The missing man was the owner of the drugs
that washed up on the beach.

24:26.320 --> 24:27.680
Mmm, I don't understand.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.120
I don't understand!

24:31.720 --> 24:33.600
I'm sure your son can explain himself.

24:34.320 --> 24:37.040
- Right, Eduardo?
- Isn't that what you're here for?

24:38.480 --> 24:41.040
I mean, like, um, finding the car,
that's your job, right?

24:42.600 --> 24:44.160
I can promise you I will.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.240
But I'm gonna have
to give you some advice.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.400
Before that, tell me everything you know.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.400
I'm gonna find that car, Eduardo,

24:50.400 --> 24:52.960
after which,
there will be no one to blame.

24:52.960 --> 24:54.920
Then it will be too late to help you.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.320
Call me when you're ready.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.760
You're a man of faith,
Mr. Jeremias.

25:01.760 --> 25:05.080
Explain to your son
there's no absolution without repentance.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.640
Good afternoon.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.440
Where did you get the cash
to pay for the operation?

25:30.440 --> 25:31.400
- Not now.
- The truth!

25:31.400 --> 25:33.600
I'd rather have a son in prison
than a free criminal.

25:33.600 --> 25:37.520
I could be in America, but I'm here
in this godforsaken place because of you!

25:39.880 --> 25:42.440
I clean the floor
whenever you piss outside the toilet.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.560
I wash your clothes,
put your food on the table,

25:44.560 --> 25:47.080
I do everything
and I've never complained, have I?

25:47.080 --> 25:50.240
I swallowed it all and kept going, and now
you're going to be able to see again

25:50.240 --> 25:52.520
because of me,
because I paid for your surgery!

25:52.520 --> 25:55.480
So, with all due respect, I don't have
to justify anything to you anymore.

25:55.480 --> 25:57.200
If your mother was here--

25:57.200 --> 25:59.840
But she's gone, Pops! She's gone!

26:00.840 --> 26:03.360
I'd love it if she was here too,
believe me.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.600
If you and I weren't stuck
in this depressing shithole,

26:05.600 --> 26:07.040
maybe she'd still be here with us.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.920
- You watch your mouth!
- Dad.

26:09.920 --> 26:12.560
When I was little and you punished me,

26:12.560 --> 26:15.320
you'd tell me that everything you did
was for my own good.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.080
I didn't believe it,

26:18.000 --> 26:19.120
but I listened.

26:20.160 --> 26:21.960
And I'm telling you the same thing.

26:21.960 --> 26:24.560
Everything that I'm doing
is for your own good.

26:30.160 --> 26:31.920
When I had him in my belly...

26:33.720 --> 26:36.400
I kept imagining
what his little face would look like.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.280
Then, when he was born,

26:40.800 --> 26:44.520
I would think
about watching his first steps,

26:45.480 --> 26:47.480
mmm, hearing his first words.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.520
A mother never wants
her child to grow up too fast,

26:52.520 --> 26:55.840
but at the same time, she keeps thinking
about what kind of man he will become.

26:55.840 --> 26:58.040
What kind of a man
will a child turn out to be

26:58.040 --> 26:59.400
who is raised without his mother?

27:03.400 --> 27:05.680
That, I will never know.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.600
Do you think
Eduardo killed Gianluca?

27:52.600 --> 27:55.000
Well, like the boy's father,
we'll see soon enough.

27:59.960 --> 28:01.440
Come on, kiddo, it was a joke.

28:01.440 --> 28:02.800
- Yeah.
- His father's blind.

28:02.800 --> 28:06.400
Mr. Jeremias is a good man.
You shouldn't make fun of him, you know?

28:06.400 --> 28:07.640
You think so?

28:07.640 --> 28:11.000
Actually, you mainlanders love
to make fun of us people of Azores.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.360
- It's quite annoying.
- Oh.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.560
You're all so sensitive, you know?

28:17.960 --> 28:19.960
- Okay, put that away. I invited you.
- I'll be going.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.320
Put that away, Francisco.

28:21.320 --> 28:24.200
There's a saying in Faial that says,
"A bearded woman should be avoided."

28:24.200 --> 28:26.800
Oh, so now, not only am I frigid...

28:28.720 --> 28:30.040
...I have a beard?

28:30.040 --> 28:32.560
If you want the detectives
to follow your orders,

28:32.560 --> 28:34.680
buy them a drink and put down the whip.

28:43.080 --> 28:45.760
- You're fucking late, Eduardo!
- Fuck it, Rafael. Jesus fucking Christ.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.360
- What's the matter?
- What's the matter?

28:47.360 --> 28:50.080
- Yes, what's the matter?
- The cops were at my place.

28:50.080 --> 28:51.960
They showed my Dad
a photo of the Italian guy.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.280
They found the Italian dude?

28:53.280 --> 28:55.160
No, but they're gonna be all over me now.

28:55.160 --> 28:58.160
If they didn't, why are you being
so dramatic on a day that's so important?

28:58.160 --> 29:00.120
- What's wrong with you? Shit.
- This is important.

29:00.120 --> 29:02.840
I have some serious news, man.
Go-- Go on, sit down, please.

29:04.520 --> 29:06.560
- I made an important life decision.
- Hmm?

29:07.960 --> 29:10.040
I'm going to propose to Sílvia, bro.

29:13.080 --> 29:14.440
So will you be my best man?

29:14.440 --> 29:16.840
Rafael, this isn't the time for weddings.

29:16.840 --> 29:19.760
- I shouldn't have to explain that to you.
- How about, "Congratulations"?

29:19.760 --> 29:22.560
"I'm very happy for you and I accept
to be your best man with joy"?

29:22.560 --> 29:24.080
Congratulations. Of course, I accept.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.200
I hope you know
how fucking much I love you.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.440
I love you so fucking much.
God damn it, brother!

29:28.440 --> 29:30.800
I'm not saying this because I'm high.
I really do love you.

29:30.800 --> 29:34.560
It's just if I don't get a ring on it,
I may lose the girl. You get it, right?

29:36.240 --> 29:38.160
Anyways, come on.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.240
Good shit, bro.

30:42.520 --> 30:45.000
Oh, my God,
look what we've got here!

30:45.000 --> 30:47.120
How much did you spend
on those nice shoes, huh?

30:47.120 --> 30:48.440
Come on, just a sip.

30:54.760 --> 30:56.880
- Hey, we need to talk.
- Get lost.

30:56.880 --> 30:58.880
Move, you fucking kid. Go!

31:01.600 --> 31:02.960
What happened to your face, huh?

31:02.960 --> 31:06.480
Well, Arruda caught me selling your snow,
and he did this to me.

31:08.240 --> 31:09.360
Stick around.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.200
- You believe this shit?
- Come with me, we have to talk.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.880
It's all here.
The first rapper from the Azores!

31:20.760 --> 31:23.280
- It was so we wouldn't lose money.
- That's brilliant, Rafael!

31:23.280 --> 31:25.600
What's wrong with you?
Do you have rocks in your head?

31:25.600 --> 31:26.840
How do you explain asking kids

31:26.840 --> 31:29.120
to sell fucked-up coke to cover up
the mess you made?

31:29.120 --> 31:32.000
So now you've become the village priest,
to give me some fucking sermons?

31:32.000 --> 31:34.120
You ain't different
than before, Wednesday!

31:34.120 --> 31:36.640
- Eduardo, the mama's boy--
- Don't fucking talk about my mother!

31:36.640 --> 31:38.000
You know what your problem is?

31:38.000 --> 31:40.200
- My fame makes you choke!
- Your fame, Ambrósio?

31:40.200 --> 31:42.480
Stop that shit!
Fuckers, you're being little bitches!

31:42.480 --> 31:45.680
You wanna know what I think about you?
You really wanna know? I fucking pity you!

31:45.680 --> 31:48.320
You're the one losing touch,
think you're some kind of drug lord.

31:48.320 --> 31:51.200
- Sílvia, come on.
- What, you think I'm a dog, you moron?

31:51.200 --> 31:54.000
I'll leave when I feel like it.
You hear me?

31:56.800 --> 31:58.720
He's so fucking stupid.

32:03.920 --> 32:07.400
Sílvia, what's going on with you?
When's the last time you slept, huh?

32:08.160 --> 32:09.040
Oh, man, you too?

32:09.960 --> 32:11.840
Now, everybody wants to be my dad.
So funny.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.440
I don't want to be your dad.

32:17.400 --> 32:19.760
You know I've always wanted
to be something else, right?

32:21.680 --> 32:25.000
No, not like this.
Not when you're like this, Sílvia.

32:37.320 --> 32:38.680
Oh, yeah.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.360
Where's Eduardo?

33:07.040 --> 33:08.080
Eduardo, bro!

33:08.760 --> 33:11.320
My Scandinavian friends,
guys with lots of money--

33:11.320 --> 33:13.240
- Later--
- Oh! Listen, this is serious!

33:13.240 --> 33:14.520
They want to buy it all!

33:14.520 --> 33:17.560
They want to buy it all. Imagine!
They want to fucking buy it all from us!

33:17.560 --> 33:19.360
Buy fucking what? What is fucking "us"?

33:19.360 --> 33:22.080
Are we partners?
Is this a fucking club now?

33:22.080 --> 33:23.840
Fucking remember your place.

33:30.160 --> 33:33.400
You're a bitch, you know that?
Yeah, you're so fucking hilarious.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.240
Thank you, Rabo de Peixe!

34:14.760 --> 34:15.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
What the fuck is this, huh?

34:19.000 --> 34:21.080
Are you fucking crazy?
What's wrong with you?

34:21.080 --> 34:23.560
- Get the fuck out now! Get the fuck out!
- Come on!

34:25.400 --> 34:28.560
You're just a bitch.
Come here, you're dead, motherfucker.

34:28.560 --> 34:30.360
You all right?

35:18.040 --> 35:20.000
What do you feel when you do that?

35:20.000 --> 35:21.120
Huh?

35:29.640 --> 35:31.600
<i>You're curious, right?</i>

35:34.920 --> 35:36.640
<i>I feel beautiful.</i>

35:38.040 --> 35:38.880
<i>And sexy.</i>

35:41.200 --> 35:42.680
<i>And euphoric.</i>

35:44.120 --> 35:46.880
<i>Like I'm a rocket hurling into space.</i>

35:59.280 --> 36:00.560
<i>I feel real horny.</i>

37:26.000 --> 37:28.560
Sílvia, please.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.040
Sílvia, fucking wake up! Come on, Sílvia!

37:33.040 --> 37:34.800
FIRE DEPARTMENT

37:34.800 --> 37:38.560
Sílvia!
Sílvia, please! Please!

37:51.440 --> 37:54.400
Hey, listen. Go inside and see
if they have news about my daughter.

37:55.920 --> 37:56.760
Hey.

37:57.880 --> 38:00.600
I've always fucking seen you as a son.

38:00.600 --> 38:02.880
But there is shit
a father can't put up with.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.040
I need your help.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.440
I'm a fucking piece of shit.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.120
I'm a piece of shit.

38:13.840 --> 38:16.120
I always hurt the people I love.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.600
I feel a weight on me.

38:24.400 --> 38:25.480
Oh, fuck.

38:33.200 --> 38:34.600
Shh.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.520
Listen to me carefully.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.800
I'll take that weight off your chest.

38:43.840 --> 38:45.000
Look at me.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.720
Now you're gonna
fucking tell me everything.

38:52.360 --> 38:53.480
Are we clear?

41:55.200 --> 41:57.000
Good morning, Mr. Jeremias.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.520
Why did you come back from America?

42:07.920 --> 42:09.520
Because of my family.

42:10.880 --> 42:12.200
A toast to that.

42:13.240 --> 42:17.240
A man who doesn't spend time
with his family is not a real man.

42:20.240 --> 42:21.920
I'm sorry about your cousin.

42:25.720 --> 42:27.360
I'm sorry about your son.

42:37.240 --> 42:39.880
Being a good father
means that doing the right thing

42:39.880 --> 42:41.680
sometimes makes you feel bad.

42:44.720 --> 42:46.040
Please don't hurt him.

42:47.280 --> 42:48.200
He's a good boy.

42:52.880 --> 42:56.720
Eduardo, this gentleman is saying
you have something that belongs to him.

42:57.360 --> 42:59.280
Your father is a decent man.

42:59.800 --> 43:01.960
This is the only reason you're not dead.

43:02.720 --> 43:04.320
I mean "yet."

43:06.040 --> 43:08.000
Show me where my stuff is.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.640
And then we'll talk about Gianluca.

43:20.400 --> 43:21.880
The boat should be here.

43:27.680 --> 43:28.840
I'll find another one.

44:03.040 --> 44:04.920
I'm sorry, Mr. Jeremias.

44:04.920 --> 44:06.560
No, no, no, no! Please, please!

44:07.160 --> 44:10.600
The boat-- The boat that you saw
was my partner's. He took the drugs.

44:11.320 --> 44:12.720
I'll help you find it, I swear.

44:12.720 --> 44:15.120
You've been free riding
for a long time, son.

44:16.120 --> 44:18.880
You can kill me,
but he's telling the truth.

44:18.880 --> 44:20.800
You have my word you can trust him.

44:22.120 --> 44:25.840
Swear. Swear on what's most sacred
that you'll give back what you took.

44:25.840 --> 44:28.200
Yes, on the Holy Christ, I promise.

44:28.200 --> 44:30.120
- He says--
- I know what he said!

45:30.680 --> 45:31.960
There's whales.

45:31.960 --> 45:33.560
- What the fuck?
- Whales!

45:33.560 --> 45:35.760
Whales? Come on, let's go see the whales.

45:36.440 --> 45:37.600
Let's go see.

45:45.920 --> 45:46.760
Over there.

46:00.760 --> 46:01.920
The north wind's coming, Dad.

47:00.480 --> 47:02.760
Hurry up. You have to leave Rabo de Peixe.

47:02.760 --> 47:04.600
No, Dad, I'm not leaving you here alone.

47:05.200 --> 47:06.920
- I'll be fine.
- What about my friends?

47:06.920 --> 47:08.360
Think about yourself.

47:08.360 --> 47:11.160
That Italian won't rest
until he gets what's his.

47:11.160 --> 47:12.280
Here, you're a dead man.

47:13.920 --> 47:15.400
Get your things.

47:38.680 --> 47:42.400
<i>Running away from your problems
is a race you never win.</i>

47:42.400 --> 47:44.200
<i>Your problems always catch up,</i>

47:44.200 --> 47:45.600
<i>they never leave you.</i>

47:46.480 --> 47:48.680
<i>I should have known
when I picked up that phone.</i>

47:48.680 --> 47:49.960
Yes? Joe here.

47:50.560 --> 47:51.480
I need your help.

47:51.480 --> 47:54.080
<i>- I don't want any problems.</i>
- It's not for me.

47:54.080 --> 47:55.200
<i>It's for the boy.</i>

47:56.560 --> 47:57.440
Fuck.

47:58.960 --> 48:00.280
Thank you, Joe.
