.
I have done it, hank!
I have finally done it

00:14.731 --> 00:17.450
i have gotten someone
to respond to my letter.

00:17.450 --> 00:18.768
You see, peggy?

00:18.768 --> 00:20.653
You just needed
to find a pen pal

00:20.653 --> 00:22.689
with as much free time
as you have.

00:22.689 --> 00:27.193
No. I sent song lyrics
to every major
country music star,

00:27.193 --> 00:30.363
and i finally got this
from mr. Randy travis.

00:30.780 --> 00:32.198
Randy travis?

00:32.198 --> 00:33.700
[Sighs]
Oh, ok!

00:33.700 --> 00:37.253
"Dear song writer,
we regret to inform you,"
blah, blah

00:37.253 --> 00:40.206
"legal reasons" blah, blah
, "never read it" blah,
blah, blah. Ok.

00:40.206 --> 00:43.877
"Once again, good luck
with your songwriting career.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.880
Signed, rob readers
of the law firm
readers and anatole."

00:47.380 --> 00:50.550
Huh, kind of sounds to me
like randy travis' lawyer

00:50.550 --> 00:52.635
sent you
a rejection letter.

00:52.635 --> 00:55.638
[Chuckling]
Oh, hank,
they have to say that.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.141
Travis loved my lyrics.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.060
He called me a songwriter.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.646
He said i have
a career in front of me,
and you know what?

01:03.646 --> 01:05.397
He is right.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.601
for our church
bus trip this year.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.103
And we decided to go

01:43.603 --> 01:45.939
to country music fan fair
in nashville, tennessee.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.775
I win! Huh, that was
my suggestion.

01:52.078 --> 01:54.581
Thank you,
assistant pastor rayburn.

01:54.581 --> 01:58.084
For those of you
who don't know,
i am peggy hill.

01:58.084 --> 02:00.837
And fan fair is
a 4-day festival

02:00.837 --> 02:04.340
where we will get to meet
our favorite
country music stars

02:04.340 --> 02:06.876
including my friend
randy travis.

02:09.963 --> 02:14.384
Ok, may god look upon you
with kindness,
and give you peace.

miss you so much.

02:23.726 --> 02:25.728
I got you this
phone card at the mall.

02:25.728 --> 02:29.532
It's good for 10 minutes
and has tony danza's
picture on it.

02:29.866 --> 02:33.620

buddha broke the mold
when he made you.

02:35.038 --> 02:37.457
Ok, people!
2-minute warning.

02:37.457 --> 02:40.493
Please see me for
your seat assignments
before you get on the bus.

02:40.493 --> 02:43.496
I was planning
to let people sit
wherever they wanted.

02:43.496 --> 02:44.497
Like church.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.500
[Chuckling]
Church is not a field trip.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.502
As a substitute educator,
i know field trips,

02:50.003 --> 02:51.504
and as a country songwriter,

02:52.005 --> 02:52.889
i also know nashville.

02:52.889 --> 02:54.390
Oh, peggy,

02:54.390 --> 02:56.893
i'm the assistant pastor
of this congregation,

02:57.393 --> 02:59.395
and i did go
to divinity school
in nashville

02:59.395 --> 03:01.231
where i wrote a hymn or 2.

03:01.231 --> 03:04.234
Yes. But you did not
get a letter
from randy travis. And i did.

03:04.234 --> 03:06.102
[Whistling]
On the bus!

03:09.689 --> 03:13.326
Good morning,
fan fairers and fan fairees.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.662
I will be calling
out various highlights

03:15.662 --> 03:18.665
of our 14-hour trip
to nashville.

03:18.665 --> 03:22.168
Our first stop will be
the world's
largest fiberglass raven

03:22.168 --> 03:25.672
which is also
the largest raven
i have ever seen.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.674
Congratulations
to eustace miller,

03:27.674 --> 03:30.593
who came closest
with a guess of 61.

03:30.593 --> 03:33.346
The number i was
thinking of was 64.

03:34.180 --> 03:36.099
Yes!

03:36.099 --> 03:39.102
Hank, is she gonna play
camp counselor

03:39.102 --> 03:41.521
through the entire
state of arkansas?

03:41.521 --> 03:43.856
Oh, come on, dale!
She's just havin' fun.

03:44.357 --> 03:46.226
Think of
another number, peggy.

03:49.028 --> 03:52.398
Hello, mr. Souphanousinphone.
Is connie there?

03:52.398 --> 03:56.319
Connie, uh, she's not here.
She's, uh...

03:56.786 --> 03:58.204
where is she?

03:58.204 --> 04:01.708
If connie want to go swimming
all afternoon with chane Wusonasong,

04:01.708 --> 04:05.411
that her business.
Enjoy your hillbilly festival.

Hey, this is tony danza.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.665
You've got 8 minutes left.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.834
(peggy)
On behalf of fan fair,

04:12.335 --> 04:13.836
let me be the first
to welcome you

04:14.337 --> 04:17.173
with a little song,
written by peggy hill.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.676
? fan fair can be fun fair?

04:19.676 --> 04:22.178
? but if you don't
put your turning light?

04:22.679 --> 04:24.731
? well, that's unfair??

04:24.731 --> 04:25.732
(peggy)
Thank you.

04:27.734 --> 04:29.235
Dinner's ready!

04:29.235 --> 04:30.820
I hope you brought
your appetites.

04:30.820 --> 04:33.573
We are having
spa-peggy and meatballs.

04:33.906 --> 04:35.908
Did she say "spa-peggy"?

04:35.908 --> 04:38.411
Well, "spa-peggy" is
a lot like spaghetti.

04:38.911 --> 04:41.414
I'm not sure
what peggy does different.

04:41.414 --> 04:42.999
If anything.

04:42.999 --> 04:46.252
.
(hank)
But it's the one dish
she's kind of made her own

04:55.511 --> 04:58.514
well, hi there, cowboy.
Now, who's this pretty girl?
Your wife?

04:58.514 --> 04:59.882
[Guffawing]

04:59.882 --> 05:02.685
We're not married.
We're just sharing a tent.

05:02.685 --> 05:05.305
And we're cousins.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.891
Can you just sign our books
and we'll be on our way?

05:08.891 --> 05:10.943
Whoa! W-what's
the trouble, bubble?

05:10.943 --> 05:14.364
Oh, i think my girlfriend
left me.

05:14.864 --> 05:16.866
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,
it's gonna be
just a little while.

05:16.866 --> 05:18.868
We got
a situation here.

05:18.868 --> 05:21.788
(dunn)
So every time you call,
mr. Superphone tells you

05:21.788 --> 05:23.656
that connie's out
with this chane fella?

05:23.656 --> 05:28.711
He said, for
the first time in her life
, connie's actually happy.

05:28.711 --> 05:32.215
It sounds like
her daddy is usin'
his chane to yank your chain.

05:32.715 --> 05:34.834
Kix is right. Heck, i got
a teenage daughter at home,

05:34.834 --> 05:36.336
and every time
her boyfriend calls,

05:36.336 --> 05:38.221
i say she's out
with brad pitt!

05:38.221 --> 05:39.722
[Exclaims]

05:40.006 --> 05:41.557
I love brad pitt.

05:41.557 --> 05:43.559
Your daughter
is so lucky.

05:43.559 --> 05:45.561
No, luanne,
don't you get it?

05:46.062 --> 05:47.847
Connie and i
are back together.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.935
Look, look,
it's really him.

05:52.935 --> 05:55.605
It's randy travis,
just like on the album cover.

05:56.105 --> 05:59.108
Oh, take a picture of me
giving him my lyrics.

05:59.108 --> 06:03.112
Someday my fans will want
to remember this moment.
Wait.

06:03.613 --> 06:04.530
Oh!

06:04.530 --> 06:07.867
? if you want to be my lady?

06:07.867 --> 06:09.168
Oh!
? you're gonna have?

06:09.535 --> 06:11.037
I'll take my sandwich now.

what i'll always be?

god made me??

What the...

06:29.188 --> 06:31.274
you stole my song!

06:35.678 --> 06:38.965
No, no, no.
No, you don't understand.
I am not the bad guy.

06:38.965 --> 06:40.216
Hank, will you
say something?

06:40.216 --> 06:42.351
Why did you punch
randy travis?

06:42.685 --> 06:45.021
This is just the way
god made me.

06:45.021 --> 06:46.522
I wrote that.

06:46.522 --> 06:48.441
(teri)
Excuse me, fellas.
Hold up a second.

06:48.441 --> 06:53.529
I'm mr. Travis's manager.
Randy would like
to speak to the lady.

06:53.529 --> 06:55.815
[Hank sighing]
...and we
completely understand

06:55.815 --> 06:57.567
if you don't wanna
give us an autograph.

06:57.567 --> 06:59.402
I have proof of
your thievery.

06:59.902 --> 07:02.288
You said i had
a promising
songwriting career.

07:02.288 --> 07:03.706
Now, how do you plead?

07:03.706 --> 07:05.708
I don't plead anything
, ma'am.

07:05.708 --> 07:07.210
I never saw your song.

07:07.210 --> 07:10.296
This is a form letter
from my guard-dog lawyers.

07:10.296 --> 07:13.132
If i had a dime
for every song a fan sent me

07:13.132 --> 07:14.634
i'd be dolly parton rich.

07:15.134 --> 07:17.136
Well, that explains it.
Thank you.

07:17.136 --> 07:18.638
Not to me it does not.

07:18.638 --> 07:20.139
You think this is
the first time

07:20.139 --> 07:22.475
2 songwriters came up
with similar lyrics?

07:22.809 --> 07:24.811
Stand by your man,
tammy wynette.

07:24.811 --> 07:27.313
Understand your man,
johnny cash.

07:27.313 --> 07:28.598
?
Do you see
a pattern here

07:28.598 --> 07:31.901
yes, but
this is just the way
god made me

07:31.901 --> 07:33.736
is uniquely peggy hill.

07:33.736 --> 07:37.490
You see, i grew up in montana
and i had very big feet.

07:37.490 --> 07:38.491
I still do.

07:38.991 --> 07:40.493
And when other kids
would make fun of me,

07:40.493 --> 07:42.495
my grandma
told me to tell them:

07:42.495 --> 07:45.498
"This is just the way
god made me."

07:45.498 --> 07:49.502
And today i am able
to pass that wisdom
on to my students.

07:50.002 --> 07:53.506
You see,
i am a boggle champion
and a substitute teacher...

07:53.506 --> 07:55.675
good for you.
Teaching is important.

07:55.675 --> 07:57.844
Hank, what do you do
for a livin'?

07:57.844 --> 08:00.346
I sell propane
and propane accessories.

08:00.346 --> 08:04.634
Ah, propane salesman!
Now, that's something
that would make a good song.

08:04.934 --> 08:06.853
I have been saying that for years.

08:07.019 --> 08:08.104

Me, too.

08:10.773 --> 08:14.727
Bobby,
i put out 2 of your mom's
apple brown bettys.

08:14.727 --> 08:19.398
Now, i'm no mathematician,
but there's
only one here now.

08:19.398 --> 08:20.900
Did you eat the other one?

08:20.900 --> 08:23.402
i can see how you might jump to that conclusion

08:23.402 --> 08:25.905
given last night's
cupcake incident.

08:25.905 --> 08:29.125
And, yes, i did take
the apple brown betty

08:29.125 --> 08:32.495
but it's for brooks and dunn,
to thank them
for easing my pain.

08:41.888 --> 08:44.390

please punish randy travis

you like.

help the situation?

Let me have
a coke with no ice

10:27.159 --> 10:29.996
.
And an alamo
for my new friend here

10:29.996 --> 10:32.498
that'll be $4, slim.

10:34.417 --> 10:35.835
[Whistling]

10:35.835 --> 10:36.836
Yay!

10:36.836 --> 10:38.871
Thank you very much.
You're very kind.

10:39.171 --> 10:41.590
Hey, this next one's got
a little story behind it.

10:41.590 --> 10:44.593
When i was a kid, you see,
i spent a lot of
time in montana.

10:44.593 --> 10:46.595
Cold, cold winters up there.

10:46.595 --> 10:50.599
When i was 9 or 10, my feet
were growing just a little bit
faster than the rest of me.

10:50.599 --> 10:51.934
What?

10:51.934 --> 10:52.935
I mean, i had big feet.

10:53.436 --> 10:55.438
We're talking like
bozo size, folks.

10:55.438 --> 10:58.357
And when the other kids
would make fun of them,
you see, my dad

10:58.858 --> 11:01.310
who, i might add, was
a substitute school teacher,

11:01.310 --> 11:02.812
[gasps]

11:02.812 --> 11:06.115
Told me, "you tell them,
'this is just
the way god made me.'"

11:06.115 --> 11:07.950
[Crowd cheering]

11:07.950 --> 11:10.069
But, oh, but,
but that's my story!

11:10.486 --> 11:12.488
2, 3, 4.

11:12.488 --> 11:14.990
?? [playing]

11:16.409 --> 11:19.578
? i have a boggle trophy?

11:20.579 --> 11:23.883
? on my bedroom shelf??

11:23.883 --> 11:27.053
Hank! Hank!

11:27.053 --> 11:29.422
(bobby)
So i called
and connie's dad answered.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.424
I disguised my voice
and said i was from

11:31.424 --> 11:34.143
.
Who's who in american
middle school students

11:34.643 --> 11:36.062
he put me right through.

11:36.062 --> 11:37.730
That only works once.

11:37.730 --> 11:39.732
And thanks for
the brown betty.

11:39.982 --> 11:42.735
Thanks for
boot scootin' boogie.

11:42.735 --> 11:44.570
All right. Let's dig
into that apple betty.

11:44.987 --> 11:47.273
Hey, get your own.
The boy gave it to me.

11:47.690 --> 11:49.191
.
It was meant
for both of us

11:49.191 --> 11:52.194
well, you kept the sweater
that girl from syracuse
gave us.

11:52.194 --> 11:54.196
Well, how am i supposed
to share a sweater, kix?

11:54.196 --> 11:55.698
?
You want me to
rip it in half

11:55.698 --> 11:57.783
umm, this is good pie.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.285
[Exclaims]

12:00.286 --> 12:02.204
Hank, where were you?

12:02.705 --> 12:04.039
Travis told my story.

12:04.507 --> 12:05.758
He said that
it happened to him.

12:06.041 --> 12:09.378
He stole boggle,
he stole montana
he stole my big feet!

12:09.378 --> 12:10.179
[Shushing]

12:10.546 --> 12:12.431
Who said that?
Who... who said that?

12:12.431 --> 12:14.767
All right. Let's go outside.

12:15.184 --> 12:19.522
I cannot believe
you are siding with travis
. i... i am your wife!

12:19.522 --> 12:23.142
Look, i believe you believe
you wrote that song.

12:23.642 --> 12:26.145
And i believe you believe
he stole your story.

12:26.145 --> 12:28.147
But that doesn't
make it true.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.065
So, i'm a liar?

12:30.065 --> 12:32.067
?
Why would i
make this up, hank

12:32.067 --> 12:34.069
[sighing]
Well, peggy,

12:34.069 --> 12:36.572
you've got a pretty
high opinion of yourself
and i...

12:36.572 --> 12:38.574
oh, then i should have
a low opinion of myself?

12:39.074 --> 12:40.075
Is that what
you're saying?

12:40.075 --> 12:41.160
No, no, not at all.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.662
It's just that you've done
so much in your life,

12:43.662 --> 12:47.416
you don't need to take credit
for things you haven't done.

12:47.666 --> 12:49.502
Like writing that song

12:49.502 --> 12:52.254
and, you know,
the other stuff.

12:52.254 --> 12:53.756
What other stuff?

12:53.756 --> 12:55.758
Well, like dinner.

12:56.008 --> 12:57.343
I mean, i think it's cute

12:57.843 --> 13:01.013
that you call it
spa-peggy and meatballs

13:01.013 --> 13:04.016
but you know,
it's just noodles
and tomato sauce

13:04.016 --> 13:05.818
and balls of meat.

13:05.818 --> 13:08.604
But then i add
just the right amount
of sugar

13:08.604 --> 13:10.906
and grated parmesano cheese.

13:10.906 --> 13:12.775
Ok. When we were
setting up camp,

13:13.275 --> 13:15.277
you said that
in your opinion

13:15.277 --> 13:18.113
kindling is the best wood
to start a fire.

13:18.113 --> 13:19.248
Well, isn't it, hank?

13:19.248 --> 13:21.750
Of course it is,
but it's not your opinion.

13:21.750 --> 13:25.120
It's a known fact.
And now you say
randy travis has taken

13:25.120 --> 13:27.623
your childhood
and calling it his own.

13:27.623 --> 13:28.791
It's getting crazy.

13:28.791 --> 13:31.961
[Gasping]
So, now i'm crazy?

13:31.961 --> 13:33.762
Well, gray area.

13:33.762 --> 13:35.631
.
I told you the truth, hank

13:35.631 --> 13:39.351
if i am lying, may god
strike me down right now.

13:41.437 --> 13:42.104
Ha!

13:43.689 --> 13:46.025
[Sighs]

13:46.025 --> 13:48.944
This is mockingbird
calling the sparrow.

13:48.944 --> 13:50.946
(bill)
Hi, dale.
Use code names, bill.

13:51.447 --> 13:52.948
I'm mockingbird.

13:52.948 --> 13:54.450
Sorry, dale.

13:54.450 --> 13:57.953
Oh, hey, pegwin.
Where's the big bird?

13:57.953 --> 14:00.456
Hank and i
are spending the rest
of the fan fair apart

14:00.456 --> 14:02.241
because of randy travis.

14:02.241 --> 14:05.127
He took me back
to his trailer
and lied to my face.

14:05.127 --> 14:06.795
I'd like to spit
on that trailer.

14:06.795 --> 14:08.747
Ah, what would that solve?

14:10.216 --> 14:12.718
We ought to wrap the trailer
in toilet paper.

14:13.219 --> 14:16.722
I think i have some left over
from the billy ray cyrus job.

14:16.722 --> 14:19.892
Yes, i like that.
I like that a lot.

14:20.392 --> 14:21.810
(hank)
All right, just one more.

14:21.810 --> 14:23.395
Then i've gotta go find peggy.

14:23.395 --> 14:25.064
Everybody smile.

14:25.231 --> 14:27.266
You're not smiling,
mr. Brooks.

14:28.817 --> 14:30.236
[Brooks retching]

14:31.103 --> 14:31.937
[Grunts]

14:32.354 --> 14:34.356
(peggy)
Mockingbird,
this is the pegwin.

14:34.356 --> 14:36.242
We are at 50%
tissue coverage.

14:36.242 --> 14:38.744
Morale is high.
How's travis?

14:39.028 --> 14:39.995
(dale)
Contained.

14:40.496 --> 14:42.581
I will secure an autograph
made out to all of us.

14:42.581 --> 14:44.583
It will be our alibi. Out.

14:44.583 --> 14:46.869
Ok, bill, throw it.
Throw it back over.

14:46.869 --> 14:49.788
I did a minute ago.
It should have landed by now.

14:49.788 --> 14:52.291
[Sighing]
Boomhauer, give me a boost.

14:55.127 --> 14:56.512
Ah, it's ok. I'll get it.

14:57.012 --> 14:57.796
[Grunts]

14:57.796 --> 14:59.214
Do you see it?

14:59.214 --> 15:00.683
[Bill screams]

15:00.683 --> 15:02.134
[Peggy shrieks]

15:02.635 --> 15:03.602
[Gasps]

15:04.687 --> 15:06.138
[Grunting]

15:06.639 --> 15:08.140
[Peggy panting]

15:08.140 --> 15:10.526
[Grunting]

15:10.526 --> 15:14.980
Well,
it never would have happened
if he hadn't stolen my song.

15:18.867 --> 15:21.787
Hey! Hey! Somebody help.

15:21.787 --> 15:23.289
Get me outta here!

15:24.323 --> 15:26.625
Get... help me get out!

15:30.679 --> 15:33.015
(peggy)
And remember, not one word.

15:33.432 --> 15:36.435
As i like to say,
"what is done is done."

15:36.435 --> 15:37.436
[Sighing]

15:37.436 --> 15:39.021
Peggy, where have you been?

15:39.021 --> 15:41.156
We dumped
randy travis's trailer
in the lake.

15:41.523 --> 15:42.524
You what?

15:42.524 --> 15:44.526
He stole peggy's song.

15:44.526 --> 15:45.694
[Dale snickers]

15:45.694 --> 15:48.197
Look at handsome randy travis.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.949
I'd like to see
his chiseled face

15:50.449 --> 15:52.368
when he goes back
to that trailer.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.621
Where are you lookin', dale?
Randy travis' booth is empty.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.006
(dale)
Na-ah.

15:57.006 --> 16:00.509
I got his autograph.
It's our alibi.

16:00.509 --> 16:03.762
This says,
"best regards,
the oak ridge boys."

16:04.263 --> 16:06.598
I-isn't he the one
with the beard?

16:06.932 --> 16:09.184
(randy)
My door is locked.
I can't get out.

16:10.269 --> 16:12.721
(hank)
Oh, god! Oh! Oh!

16:16.642 --> 16:19.228
[Water bubbling]

16:19.228 --> 16:23.232
Please be ok.
Please, please be ok.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.734
Why would he
toilet-paper
and then drive

16:25.734 --> 16:28.237
his own traile
r into the lake?

16:28.737 --> 16:29.738
Puzzling.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.294
[People chattering]

16:45.471 --> 16:48.340
?
Oh, hank,
what is taking so long

16:49.842 --> 16:51.343
[hank gasps]

16:52.678 --> 16:54.179
[Hank panting]

16:57.099 --> 16:59.101
I was takin' a nap.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.603
The trailer must have
come off the blocks.

17:01.603 --> 17:04.740
Next year i'm gonna hire
somebody to set it up.

17:05.741 --> 17:07.526
Hank, i am so, so sorry.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.034
[Hank sighs]

17:15.034 --> 17:17.786
(hank)
Peggy said it was an accident,
but i don't know.

17:17.786 --> 17:20.789
She thinks randy travi
s stole her song lyrics

17:20.789 --> 17:22.290
and maybe that sen
t her over the edge.

17:22.290 --> 17:25.294
hank, rev. Schuller
once delivered a sermon

17:25.294 --> 17:27.296
That came straight
from my christmas card

17:27.296 --> 17:30.632
but i didn't throw a rock
through the crystal cathedral.

17:30.632 --> 17:33.135
Well, i might have
made things worse.

17:33.635 --> 17:36.638
I said some
awful things to her,
pastor larry.

17:36.638 --> 17:39.391
I told her she's not as great
as she thinks she is.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.478
.
Better she hears it
from someone she loves

17:42.478 --> 17:45.481
maybe she did try to
drown randy travis.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.784
Uh, no, what am i saying?
She'd have to be crazy.

17:48.784 --> 17:50.536
But maybe the fact
that her husband

17:51.036 --> 17:53.455
didn't support her
could have...

17:53.455 --> 17:55.290
no, peggy's not crazy.

17:55.290 --> 17:56.241
[Chuckles]

17:56.742 --> 17:57.910
Right?

18:02.414 --> 18:04.583
So, doc, in your opinion,

18:04.583 --> 18:07.086
,
had he shared some
of the brown betty

18:07.086 --> 18:08.670
would he have gotten
quite this sick?

18:08.670 --> 18:11.673
Ronnie, please,
i'm very ill.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.809
What was in that
brown betty, anyway?

18:13.809 --> 18:15.811
Um, i don't know.

18:15.811 --> 18:17.179
.
My mom made it

18:19.148 --> 18:20.899
aunt peggy,
what are you doin' here?

18:20.899 --> 18:24.403
Randy travis is
gonna bring uncle hank up
on stage any minute

18:24.403 --> 18:26.572
to thank him
for saving his life.

18:27.072 --> 18:30.359
Well, hank doesn't want me
anywhere near
the final jam concert.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.362
He said he was afraid
i'd take a swing
at faith hill

18:33.829 --> 18:35.831
for stealing our last name.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.000
[Crowd cheering]

18:38.000 --> 18:41.503
(m.c.)
One more time
for martina mcbride!

18:41.503 --> 18:43.839
(martina)
Thank you. This next act
has been featured

18:43.839 --> 18:46.341
on the cover
of over 20 million boxes
of corn flakes.

18:46.842 --> 18:48.844
Ladies and gentlemen, dunn!

18:48.844 --> 18:50.929
[Crowd cheering]

18:50.929 --> 18:54.099
(hank)
"To hank hill, love, wynonna."

18:54.099 --> 18:55.100
[Chuckles]
Thank you.

18:55.100 --> 18:57.102
I'm gonna hang this in my garage.

18:57.102 --> 18:58.971
Now, you'll think about what i said?

18:58.971 --> 19:00.973
I was raised
with charcoal.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.475
I'll die with charcoal.
So back off!

19:06.145 --> 19:09.148
Mr. Hill, i'm trooper larson
with the tennessee
state police.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.150
,
we received a tip
that your wife, peggy hill

19:11.650 --> 19:13.235
might try to harm
mr. Randy travis.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.237
A tip? Who told you that?

19:15.654 --> 19:16.989
I did.
What?

19:16.989 --> 19:17.873
You can't do that.

19:18.373 --> 19:19.374
I'm sorry, hank.

19:19.875 --> 19:22.628
Your wife's nuts.
She's a threat to others.

19:22.628 --> 19:23.962
We don't know that.

19:23.962 --> 19:26.215
Nobody can really
replace kix brooks.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.917
But would you all mind
if randy travis
gave it a try?

19:28.917 --> 19:31.053
[Crowd cheering]

19:31.053 --> 19:33.755
Mr. Hill, do you know
where your wife is?

19:35.641 --> 19:36.642
?
Do you
see somethin', sir

19:36.975 --> 19:38.927
there she is.
That's peggy hill.

19:38.927 --> 19:39.511
(larson)
Mrs. Hill.

19:40.012 --> 19:40.562
Oh, no.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.015
Peggy, i thought we agreed
you weren't gonna come

19:43.015 --> 19:44.516
to the final jam concert.

19:44.983 --> 19:46.985
I am here to
see randy travis.

19:46.985 --> 19:48.987
I have something special
to give to him.

19:48.987 --> 19:50.989
(larson)
Ma'am, i'd like you
to come down

19:50.989 --> 19:52.691
to the police tent
with me.
What?

19:52.691 --> 19:54.693
Well, i'm here
to apologize.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.112
Look, i brought him
an apple brown betty.

19:58.247 --> 19:59.665
Homemade.

19:59.665 --> 20:00.999
[Sighing]
All right.

20:00.999 --> 20:02.251
You see that?
It's just a pie.

20:02.501 --> 20:03.168
No knife, even.

20:03.669 --> 20:05.170
Apple brown betty.

20:05.170 --> 20:07.172

Ma'am, place the baked goods
on the table
and take a step back, please.

20:21.687 --> 20:23.689
Why are you
looking at me like that?

20:23.689 --> 20:27.693
Randy travis stole my song,
but i am not
going to kill him.

20:27.693 --> 20:29.278
I am not crazy.

20:29.278 --> 20:32.281
Well, yeah, peggy.

You and your brown betty

Wait. She's not crazy.

20:42.157 --> 20:43.625
I'll just take her home.

20:43.625 --> 20:45.711
No. We have to test the pie.

20:45.711 --> 20:49.831
What if i eat a piece
of this brown betty
and i'm ok?

20:49.831 --> 20:53.385
Then it'll prove
my wife's telling the truth,
right?

20:53.385 --> 20:55.087
(peggy)
Hank, don't!

20:55.087 --> 20:56.888
It's for randy travis.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.726
(larson)
Mr. Hill, don't.

Now, that is
a good piece of pie.

21:16.908 --> 21:19.745
They ought to change the name
to apple brown peggy.

21:19.745 --> 21:23.248
No, it's
an apple brown betty.

21:23.248 --> 21:26.251

I just add
a spoonful of orange juice

21:26.618 --> 21:28.754

does that.

[Crowd cheering]

21:32.341 --> 21:34.626
And now i'd like to
introduce y'all to hank hill.

21:34.626 --> 21:38.130
A man who taught me
just how precious life is.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.632
You see,
yesterday my trailer
fell in the lake

21:40.632 --> 21:44.136
and just as i was
freeing myself,
i saw this loyal fan

21:44.136 --> 21:46.138
drowning in the water nearby.

21:46.138 --> 21:49.141
And i saved his life.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.642
I want to bring him up
to sing with me.

21:50.642 --> 21:52.027
Come on up here, hank.

21:52.027 --> 21:53.111
[Crowd cheering]

21:53.612 --> 21:55.614

Well, i'll punch him
this time.

21:55.614 --> 21:57.616

No, what's the use?

22:03.055 --> 22:06.725
(randy)
i have a boggle trophy?

22:08.060 --> 22:11.563
on my bedroom shelf?

22:11.563 --> 22:15.100
i won it on my own?

22:16.068 --> 22:20.405
with help from no one else?

22:20.405 --> 22:24.409

that i'm not perfect?

22:24.910 --> 22:29.114
