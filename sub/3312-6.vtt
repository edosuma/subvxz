WEBVTT

00:07.541 --> 00:10.178
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:10.211 --> 00:13.181
WELL, I'M OFF. WATCH THE
KIDS, FEED THE KIDS,

00:13.214 --> 00:15.015
TRY NOT TO KILL THE KIDS.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.684
GOT IT. WAIT... WHAT
WAS THAT LAST ONE?

00:18.386 --> 00:20.188
WOW, LOOK AT THAT OUTFIT.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.323
NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE, HUH?
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO...

00:22.356 --> 00:24.358
A NIGHT OUT ON THE TOWN
WITH YOUR SISTER WIVES?

00:24.392 --> 00:26.594
NO, I'M GOING OUT WITH DONALD.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.163
YEAH? WHERE'S HE'S TAKING
YOU, A BARN RAISING?

00:29.197 --> 00:31.699
YOU GOING TO CHURN
A LITTLE BUTTER?

00:31.732 --> 00:34.702
NO ONE'S BUTTER IS GETTING CHURNED.
IT'S OVER WITH DONALD.

00:34.735 --> 00:37.571
OH, I SEE. SO THAT'S
YOUR DUMPING OUTFIT.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.540
YEP, THIS IS DEFENSIVE DRESSING.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.209
YOU DON'T BRING OUT
THE SNACK TRAY

00:41.242 --> 00:43.244
UNLESS YOU'RE GOING
TO BE SERVING DINNER.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.645
I DON'T WANT TO GET
THE GUY'S HOPES UP.

00:44.678 --> 00:48.249
I DON'T THINK YOU'D TURN ON
A PILGRIM IN THAT OUTFIT.

00:48.282 --> 00:51.051
SO WHY IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH
DONALD COMING TO SUCH A HASTY END?

00:51.085 --> 00:53.754
WE NEVER REALLY CLICKED. DONALD'S
A GOOD GUY AND EVERYTHING,

00:53.787 --> 00:55.723
BUT I JUST WASN'T FEELING IT.

00:55.756 --> 00:59.727
NOR DO I INTEND TO FEEL IT, WHICH MAKES
IT A LOT EASIER TO GIVE HIM THE HEAVE-HO.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.695
I'M CURIOUS... WHEN YOU
BREAK UP WITH A GUY,

01:01.729 --> 01:03.531
DO YOU GO IN WITH A SCRIPT
OR DO YOU JUST WING IT?

01:03.564 --> 01:06.767
NO, TIGHTLY SCRIPTED. THE GOAL
IS TO BE BRIEF AND MERCIFUL.

01:06.800 --> 01:10.271
- PROFESSIONAL.
- SO LIKE A MOB HIT.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.740
EXACTLY. IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.
THE GUY IS TAKING ME TO DINNER.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.543
WAIT A MINUTE... YOU'RE WHACKING THE
GUY AND YOU'RE STILL GOING TO EAT?

01:15.576 --> 01:18.646
I'M NOT COMPLETELY HEARTLESS!
I'LL TAKE IT TO-GO.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.349
ANYTHING THAT TRAVELS WELL:

01:21.382 --> 01:24.818
RISOTTO, PASTA, COBB SALAD...
DRESSING ON THE SIDE.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.654
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I ACTUALLY

01:26.687 --> 01:29.790
STILL SEE A LITTLE BIT OF SKIN HERE.
HOLD ON A MINUTE.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.492
LET ME JUST...

01:34.728 --> 01:36.664
THERE YOU GO!

01:36.697 --> 01:38.499
I WOULD BREAK UP
WITH YOU SO HARD.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.067
OH!

01:40.100 --> 01:42.136
( theme music playing )

01:42.170 --> 01:44.638
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

01:44.672 --> 01:47.107
♪ WITH ME ♪

01:51.245 --> 01:53.514
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE HAVING?

01:53.547 --> 01:56.517
I CAN'T ORDER UNLESS I KNOW
WHAT THE OTHER PERSON'S HAVING.

01:56.550 --> 01:59.653
OH, UH, WELL, THE
HALIBUT LOOKS GOOD.

01:59.687 --> 02:01.689
OOH, BUT IT DOESN'T TRAVEL WELL.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.825
FROM THE KITCHEN TO THE TABLE.
LOOK HOW FAR AWAY THAT IS.

02:04.858 --> 02:08.162
- GOOD EVENING, ARE YOU READY TO...
- RISOTTO!

02:08.196 --> 02:10.798
- DONALD?
- UH, I DON'T KNOW.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.700
UM, I GUESS I'LL HAVE THAT TOO.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.336
NO!

02:15.369 --> 02:18.239
- WELL, YEAH OKAY.
- VERY GOOD.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.841
MAY I INTEREST YOU IN A
CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE FOR DESSERT?

02:20.874 --> 02:23.177
- I LOVE SOUFFLE.
- WE ASK YOU TO ORDER IT NOW,

02:23.211 --> 02:25.413
- AS IT TAKES 40 MINUTES TO PREPARE.
- OOH, 40?

02:25.446 --> 02:27.781
YEAH, THERE'S NO WAY I'LL STILL BE...
HEE HEE...

02:27.815 --> 02:30.518
HUNGRY.

02:30.551 --> 02:33.287
SO, DONALD,

02:33.321 --> 02:35.155
THERE'S SOMETHING I
NEED TO TELL YOU.

02:35.189 --> 02:37.191
OKAY, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU FIRST.

02:37.225 --> 02:40.328
GOOD IDEA. MINE MIGHT BE
KINDA TOUGH TO FOLLOW.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.296
I WAS FIRED THIS MORNING.

02:42.330 --> 02:45.466
10 YEARS OF LOYAL SERVICE AND
THEY KICK ME TO THE CURB.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.501
OH WOW, I'M SORRY.

02:47.535 --> 02:50.304
WHEN ONE DOOR CLOSES,
ANOTHER ONE OPENS.

02:50.338 --> 02:52.773
AND THEN ANOTHER ONE CLOSES.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.908
THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF
THE WORST DAYS EVER.

02:54.942 --> 02:57.845
I ALMOST CANCELED OUR DATE
TONIGHT, BUT THEN I REALIZED

02:57.878 --> 03:00.314
I'VE STILL GOT ONE GOOD
THING LEFT IN MY LIFE.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.516
OH, WHAT'S THAT?

03:02.550 --> 03:04.652
OH, ME?!

03:04.685 --> 03:06.854
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D
DO WITHOUT YOU, MEL.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.922
YOUR SMILE IS LIKE SUNLIGHT

03:08.956 --> 03:11.759
BREAKING THROUGH THE
CLOUDS OF MY DESPAIR.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.496
SO WHAT WAS IT YOU
WANTED TO TELL ME?

03:17.331 --> 03:19.800
I CAN'T BREAK UP WITH HIM NOW. HE'S
GOT THE CONFIDENCE OF PUDDING.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.769
I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL HE
GETS BACK ON HIS FEET,

03:21.802 --> 03:24.838
- FINDS ANOTHER JOB.
- FINDS ANOTHER JOB IN THIS ECONOMY?

03:24.872 --> 03:29.443
- I HOPE YOU LIKE PUDDING.
- NO, I LIKE A MAN I CAN CHEW.

03:29.477 --> 03:33.414
- WE'VE GOT TO FIND HIM ANOTHER JOB.
- I'M SORRY... "WE"?

03:33.447 --> 03:36.216
YOU'RE RIGHT... YOU! YOU'VE
GOT TO FIND HIM ANOTHER JOB.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.852
C'MON, I'VE HEARD YOU BRAG ABOUT
ALL THE EXECUTIVES YOU HIRED

03:38.886 --> 03:41.489
BACK WHEN YOU RAN AMERICA.
YOU CAN DO THIS.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.258
OKAY, NOW I KNOW YOU'RE DESPERATE
BECAUSE YOU'RE FLATTERING ME.

03:44.292 --> 03:47.695
WITH THE TRUTH! YOU KNOW WHAT
EXECUTIVES ARE LOOKING FOR.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.898
DONALD'S BEEN IN THE SAME JOB FOREVER.
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO SELL HIMSELF.

03:50.931 --> 03:55.235
BUT YOU ARE JOE LONGO, THE
ZEN MASTER OF BUSINESS.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.237
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT THE
FIRST PERSON TO SAY THAT.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.440
I KNOW. I'VE HEARD YOU SAY IT.

03:59.473 --> 04:02.376
- SO YOU'LL DO IT?
- YES.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.977
GREATNESS CALLS.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.347
THANK YOU! OH, BUT YOU'VE
GOT TO DO IT QUICK,

04:06.380 --> 04:08.582
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO
EXTEND MYSELF IN OTHER AREAS

04:08.616 --> 04:10.884
TO KEEP THIS RELATIONSHIP
GOING, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.686
MY CHARITY ONLY GOES SO FAR.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.788
- I DON'T WANT TO LAY IT ALL OUT...
- I GET IT!

04:18.025 --> 04:19.593
( doorbell rings )

04:19.627 --> 04:21.529
HELLO, LENNOX.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.230
HEY, HOLLY, LET ME
GET RYDER FOR YOU.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.833
ACTUALLY I'D LIKE
TO SPEAK TO YOU...

04:25.866 --> 04:28.469
- IN PRIVATE.
- UH...

04:28.502 --> 04:30.838
OKAY, LET'S DO IT OUTSIDE
WHERE THERE'S DAYLIGHT...

04:30.871 --> 04:32.940
AND WITNESSES.

04:35.409 --> 04:38.946
THIS PAST SATURDAY I ATTENDED
DENNIS KITSON'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

04:38.979 --> 04:42.516
WHILE AT SAID PARTY A MOST
TERRIBLE THING HAPPENED.

04:42.550 --> 04:45.018
SOMEONE COULDN'T
GET TO THE POINT?

04:45.052 --> 04:47.621
I ACCIDENTALLY KISSED A
BOY WHO WASN'T RYDER.

04:47.655 --> 04:50.991
ACCIDENTALLY? WHAT, YOU TRIPPED AND
YOUR TONGUE FELL IN HIS MOUTH?

04:51.024 --> 04:54.928
HOW EXACTLY DID
THIS MISHAP OCCUR?

04:54.962 --> 05:00.000
WELL, AT THE PARTY, I WAS COMPLAINING
ABOUT A VERY UNSIGHTLY PIMPLE

05:00.033 --> 05:03.571
WHICH HAD COME TO DOMINATE MY LIFE.
AND MY FOREHEAD.

05:03.604 --> 05:06.273
TIM LOGAN HEARD ME
COMPLAINING ABOUT IT

05:06.306 --> 05:08.576
AND SAID, "YO, I
DON'T SEE ANY ZIT."

05:08.609 --> 05:10.978
THAT "YO" WAS SUCH A
CONFIDENCE-BOOSTER

05:11.011 --> 05:13.614
THAT THE NEXT THING I KNEW,
OUR LIPS WERE ENTWINED.

05:13.647 --> 05:17.317
BUT RYDER IS YOUR BOYFRIEND! HOW COULD
YOU DO THAT TO MY LITTLE BROTHER?

05:17.351 --> 05:19.353
I KNOW, I KNOW, I FEEL AWFUL.

05:19.387 --> 05:22.289
I CAME TO YOU BECAUSE
YOU KNOW HIM BEST.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.692
- WHAT SHOULD I DO?
- YOU HAVE TO TELL RYDER.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.060
DARN. I WAS HOPING YOU'D SAY,

05:27.094 --> 05:30.063
"WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES,
JUST MOVE ON."

05:30.097 --> 05:31.632
IF YOU DON'T TELL HIM, I WILL.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.000
NO NO NO, PLEASE DON'T, DON'T.

05:33.033 --> 05:36.370
LOOK, I'LL DO IT, I SWEAR.

05:36.404 --> 05:39.006
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING,

05:39.039 --> 05:40.808
BUT DON'T MAKE ME REGRET THIS.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.711
OH, LENNOX, YOU'RE
A TRUE FRIEND.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.479
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

05:45.513 --> 05:48.348
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LIKE TO
ACCIDENTALLY MAKE OUT WITH PEOPLE.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.388
OKAY, SO YOUR RESUME'S
LOOKING A LOT BETTER,

05:54.422 --> 05:57.090
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS HOW YOU'RE
GOING TO PERFORM IN THE JOB INTERVIEW.

05:57.124 --> 06:00.027
SO LET'S SAY THE GUY ASKS YOU
WHAT YOUR GREATEST STRENGTH IS.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.830
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- I DON'T KNOW...

06:02.863 --> 06:05.499
- LOYALTY?
- ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S YOUR GREATEST WEAKNESS?

06:05.533 --> 06:07.735
I HAVE A TINY BLADDER.

06:07.768 --> 06:11.104
HERE'S A TIP: DON'T EVER
USE THE WORD "BLADDER"

06:11.138 --> 06:12.973
IN A JOB INTERVIEW.

06:13.006 --> 06:16.043
OH GOD, NO ONE'S GONNA
WANT TO HIRE ME.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.512
COME ON, MAN. YOU GOTTA
WORK ON YOUR CONFIDENCE.

06:18.546 --> 06:21.482
YOU GOTTA MAKE 'EM WANT YOU. YOU
DON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

06:21.515 --> 06:25.519
EXCUSE ME. CAN I BORROW
YOUR NEWSPAPER FOR A SEC?

06:25.553 --> 06:28.722
SURE. I'M ONLY LOOKING AT THE
WANT ADS ANYWAY. I'M UNEMPLOYED.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.725
- HERE YOU GO.
- WAIT WAIT WAIT.

06:31.759 --> 06:34.595
ACTUALLY I'M NOT SURE IF WE WANT
TO PART WITH THIS NEWSPAPER HERE.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.597
PLEASE? THERE ISN'T
ANY WIFI IN HERE

06:36.630 --> 06:39.433
AND I REALLY WANT TO CHECK OUT THE
MOVIE TIMES FOR "SLAUGHTERHOUSE."

06:39.467 --> 06:41.368
"SLAUGHTERHOUSE"? THAT'S
A PRETTY SCARY MOVIE.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.770
YOU GOING TO GO SEE THAT
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND?

06:42.803 --> 06:45.506
NO BOYFRIEND, JUST ME.

06:45.539 --> 06:48.642
OH, I'M SORRY. I DON'T THINK
I CAN LET YOU DO THAT.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.545
I CAN'T LET YOU GO SEE THIS
SCARY MOVIE ALL BY YOURSELF.

06:51.579 --> 06:54.948
WHAT DO YOU SAY I MEET YOU
AT THE ORPHEUM TONIGHT?

06:54.982 --> 06:57.451
WOW, SOMEONE'S PRETTY
SURE OF THEMSELVES.

06:57.485 --> 07:00.854
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE ME.
( laughs )

07:00.888 --> 07:03.090
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU
TONIGHT AT 8:00.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.493
- OKAY.
- ( both laugh )

07:07.194 --> 07:09.797
HUH. THINK SHE'LL
REALLY SHOW UP?

07:10.964 --> 07:12.900
YEAH, MAN, SHE'S GONNA SHOW UP.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.069
SEE, WHAT YOU JUST WITNESSED THERE,
DONALD, WAS A LESSON IN CONFIDENCE.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.071
ALL RIGHT? I DIDN'T
TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.809
MATTER OF FACT, I JUST SOLD HER SOMETHING
SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT SHE WANTED.

07:21.842 --> 07:25.045
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WAS?
100% JOE LONGO.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.114
WHAT ARE YOU SELLING, DONALD?

07:29.116 --> 07:31.885
ALL THIS?

07:36.690 --> 07:38.959
- REALLY GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
- YEAH.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.065
THAT SMELLS GOOD. WHAT IS THAT?

07:45.098 --> 07:47.134
IT'S MY FAMOUS BUTTERNUT
SQUASH RAVIOLI.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.570
OH? IS IT REALLY FAMOUS, JOE?

07:49.603 --> 07:52.940
IS IT DATING A SUPERMODEL?
DID IT BEAT UP PAPARAZZI?

07:52.973 --> 07:55.543
WAS IT ON "DANCING
WITH THE STARS"?

07:55.576 --> 07:57.711
FINISHED HIGHER THAN YOU DID.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.212
( knocks )

08:00.781 --> 08:03.050
HEY, IT'S DONALD.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.018
WHAT? DON'T OPEN IT.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.087
HE... HE SEES ME.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.824
- WHY IS HE HERE?
- IF ONLY THERE WAS A WAY WE COULD FIND OUT.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.094
HEY, DONALD, WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

08:14.127 --> 08:16.830
YES, WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE SO
DELIGHTFULLY UNANNOUNCED?

08:16.864 --> 08:19.066
I WANTED TO TELL YOU I
JUST HAD AN INTERVIEW

08:19.099 --> 08:21.969
WITH HARTMAN-GLASSBERG
AND IT WENT GREAT.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.905
REALLY? SO YOU MIGHT BE EMPLOYED SOON?
'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.

08:24.938 --> 08:27.941
- NO, DIDN'T GET THE JOB.
- AW. I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WENT GREAT.

08:27.975 --> 08:30.944
IT DID. I MADE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH
THE INTERVIEW WITHOUT GETTING SICK.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.814
- GOOD FOR YOU!
- UNTIL JUST NOW IN YOUR DRIVEWAY.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.150
DONALD, REMEMBER HOW WE TALKED
ABOUT NOT OVER-SHARING?

08:37.184 --> 08:39.987
- KEEPING A LITTLE MYSTERY?
- RIGHT RIGHT.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.591
I DIDN'T SAY WHERE
IN THE DRIVEWAY.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.127
THE SESSIONS WITH YOU ARE
HELPING SO MUCH, JOE.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.497
EVEN THOUGH I GOT SHOT DOWN FOR THE JOB, I
STILL HAD THE CONFIDENCE TO COME OVER HERE

08:50.530 --> 08:52.800
AND SAY, "HEY, MEL BURKE,

08:52.833 --> 08:55.002
YOU AND I ARE HAVING
DINNER TONIGHT."

08:55.035 --> 08:57.004
OH, SORRY, DONALD.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.940
YOU KNOW, JOE MADE HIS FAMOUS...
UH...

08:59.973 --> 09:01.975
ORANGE LUMPS.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.778
SORRY, PRETTY LADY, BUT I WILL
NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.246
( chuckles ) NO.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.650
- ( brightly ) OKAY!
- HEY, DON'T BACK DOWN.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.218
( clears throat ) CAN
I CALL YOU LATER?

09:11.251 --> 09:14.788
- DON'T USE QUESTIONS.
- I'M CALLING YOU LATER.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.592
BUT RIGHT NOW I HAVE TO...
Y'KNOW,

09:18.626 --> 09:20.093
USE THE RESTROOM.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.930
FOR SOMETHING REALLY MYSTERIOUS.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.200
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU TEACHING HIM?

09:27.234 --> 09:29.302
YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO TOUR THE
FACTORY, BUT I PROMISE YOU

09:29.336 --> 09:31.872
WHEN THE PRODUCT HITS THE SHELVES,
YOU'RE GONNA BE IMPRESSED.

09:31.905 --> 09:35.142
WHEN WILL THAT BE? I DON'T KNOW HOW
MUCH LONGER I CAN KEEP PITY-DATING HIM.

09:35.175 --> 09:38.078
- HE'S GETTING HANDSY.
- LOOK, I'LL BUMP HIM UP TO FIVE SESSIONS A WEEK.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.113
NEXT WEEK HE HAS TWO MORE OF
THOSE INTERVIEWS AND I THINK

09:40.147 --> 09:41.982
ONE OF THOSE IS GOING
TO COME THROUGH,

09:42.015 --> 09:45.953
AND THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BREAK
THAT POOR SUCKER'S HEART GUILT-FREE.

09:45.986 --> 09:48.121
- I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.
- YEAH YOU DO.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.959
BOY, IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.794
HAS IT? IT'S ONLY
BEEN FIVE SESSIONS.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.996
I MEAN A... A WEEK.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.165
SO JOE SAYS THAT YOU'VE
HAD SOME INTERVIEWS

09:58.198 --> 09:59.900
AND YOU MIGHT HAVE A JOB OFFER?

09:59.933 --> 10:02.235
- I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.
- OH.

10:02.269 --> 10:06.139
- I GOT TWO JOB OFFERS.
- OH, THANK GOD! THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

10:06.173 --> 10:09.209
I MEAN FOR YOU TOO. UH...
FOR YOU MAINLY!

10:09.242 --> 10:12.179
SUDDENLY I AM IN DEMAND.
I'M A WHOLE NEW DONALD.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.147
MY LIFE IS STARTING
A NEW CHAPTER.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.283
SPEAKING OF NEW CHAPTERS
AND FRESH STARTS,

10:16.316 --> 10:18.218
I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT US.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.253
UM, LOOK, IN EVERY RELATIONSHIP,
THERE COMES A TIME...

10:20.287 --> 10:23.190
- ARE YOU FOLKS READY TO ORDER?
- OH YES.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.959
I DON'T SEE IT HERE, BUT I'D
LOVE THE STEAK SANDWICH.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.161
I'M SORRY, WE ONLY SERVE THE
STEAK SANDWICH AT LUNCH.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.230
OHHH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.199
IT'S JUST SO EASY TO EAT
WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING...

10:32.232 --> 10:34.702
TO DESSERT-TOWN.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.937
DO ME A FAVOR: COULD YOU
SEND THE MANAGER OVER?

10:36.970 --> 10:39.006
- THANK YOU.
- OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.174
- MEL, I GOT THIS.
- NO, IT'S OKAY, I'LL JUST SETTLE FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

10:41.208 --> 10:44.644
I DON'T THINK A WOMAN LIKE YOU
SHOULD EVER SETTLE FOR ANYTHING.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.215
GOOD EVENING. MAY I HELP YOU?

10:48.248 --> 10:50.250
I HOPE SO. ( clears throat )

10:50.283 --> 10:53.253
MY DINNER COMPANION HAS HER HEART
SET ON YOUR STEAK SANDWICH.

10:53.286 --> 10:56.623
- AND I WOULD LIKE FOR HER TO HAVE IT.
- I'M SORRY, SIR,

10:56.656 --> 10:59.693
- THAT'S A LUNCH ITEM.
- I UNDERSTAND IT USUALLY IS.

10:59.727 --> 11:02.195
BUT YOU HAVE THE STEAK,
YOU HAVE THE BREAD.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.865
I'M SURE THE TECHNOLOGY
EXISTS TO...

11:06.066 --> 11:07.968
SO COULD YOU MAKE THAT HAPPEN

11:08.001 --> 11:10.237
AS A PERSONAL FAVOR FOR
THE LOVELY LADY AND ME?

11:10.270 --> 11:12.205
I BELIEVE I CAN MAKE
THAT WORK, SIR.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.875
ALL RIGHT, I KNEW YOU
WERE THE MAN FOR THE JOB.

11:14.908 --> 11:18.946
WOW, THAT WAS AMAZING THE WAY
YOU MIND-CONTROLLED HIM.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.914
YOU'RE LIKE THE STEAK
SANDWICH JEDI.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.383
MEL, THE KEY TO
GETTING WHAT YOU WANT

11:23.416 --> 11:27.220
IS NEVER TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

11:27.254 --> 11:30.257
SO WHAT WAS IT YOU WERE GOING
TO SAY ABOUT FRESH STARTS?

11:31.892 --> 11:34.461
I THINK WE OUGHT TO
HAVE ONE RIGHT NOW.

11:45.338 --> 11:49.209
- JOE, I NEED YOUR HELP.
- YEAH, I GET THAT A LOT.

11:49.242 --> 11:52.312
- HOLLY CHEATED ON RYDER.
- WOW, WHAT DID SHE DO...

11:52.345 --> 11:55.082
SHE WHIP SOME OTHER
BOY BEHIND HIS BACK?

11:55.115 --> 11:57.250
NO, SHE MADE OUT WITH
ANOTHER GUY AT A PARTY.

11:57.284 --> 12:00.253
AND SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO FESS UP LIKE A
WEEK AGO BUT SHE HASN'T DONE IT YET

12:00.287 --> 12:02.089
AND SOMEONE NEEDS TO
TELL RYDER THE TRUTH.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.191
WELL, YEAH. WHY AREN'T
YOU THAT SOMEONE?

12:06.459 --> 12:08.796
PLEASE? I DON'T HAVE THE HEART.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.463
AND YOU'RE SO GOOD
AT EVERYTHING.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.233
ONLY EVERYTHING I'VE EVER TRIED.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.936
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

12:17.304 --> 12:20.107
HEY, BUDDY. SO JUST MAKING A
LITTLE IDLE CHIT-CHAT HERE.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.775
HOW ARE THINGS GOING
WITH YOU AND HOLLY?

12:21.809 --> 12:24.211
- GREAT. COULDN'T BE BETTER.
- IS THAT RIGHT?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.313
YEAH, I MEAN, IN THE PAST

12:26.346 --> 12:28.748
SHE MAY HAVE BEEN A TAD
BIT CONTROLLING...

12:28.782 --> 12:31.919
YOU DO KNOW WHAT
"A TAD" IS, RIGHT?

12:31.952 --> 12:34.354
YEAH, A BABY FROG.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.289
ANYWAY...

12:38.325 --> 12:42.195
YESTERDAY SHE LET ME BLOW
MY NOSE IN FRONT OF HER.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.464
THAT'S A BIG STEP FOR YOU GUYS.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.868
- SO YOU'RE HAPPY?
- COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

12:47.901 --> 12:51.471
OH, ALL RIGHT. WELL,
IT'S GOOD, IT'S GOOD.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.306
I CAN'T DO IT. I CAN'T DO IT.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.508
HE'S IN A HAPPY RELATIONSHIP.
YOU KNOW HOW RARE THAT IS?

12:55.542 --> 12:58.145
YOU HAVE TO. HE NEEDS TO KNOW.

12:58.178 --> 13:01.781
I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT HIM!
SAD AND CLUELESS,

13:01.815 --> 13:04.751
- DRINKING HIS MILK.
- AHHHH.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.254
( mouths word )

13:09.823 --> 13:11.959
HEY, RYDER, SO, UM,

13:11.992 --> 13:14.928
YOU KNOW... SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW,

13:14.962 --> 13:16.897
WHEN YOU'RE GOING
OUT WITH A GIRL,

13:16.930 --> 13:19.166
YOU... YOU THINK
THAT SHE'S ONE WAY,

13:19.199 --> 13:22.836
BUT IN ALL ACTUALITY,
SHE'S REALLY ANOTHER.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.471
JOE, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

13:24.504 --> 13:26.373
HOLLY CHEATED ON YOU, BUD.

13:26.406 --> 13:30.377
OH YEAH, I KNOW. SHE MADE OUT
WITH TIM LOGAN AT THAT PARTY.

13:30.410 --> 13:34.882
- WAIT, YOU KNEW?
- HOW CLUELESS DO YOU THINK I AM?

13:36.449 --> 13:39.086
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HOLLY THAT YOU KNEW?
- WHY WOULD I?

13:39.119 --> 13:40.854
IT'S BEEN THE BEST TWO
WEEKS OF MY LIFE.

13:40.888 --> 13:44.824
TOMORROW, SHE'S BAKING ME A PIE.
I LOVE PIE.

13:44.858 --> 13:48.228
- AREN'T YOU UPSET?
- I WAS AT FIRST.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.463
BUT THEN SHE STARTED
ACTING SO SWEET.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.565
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT SHE FEELS
BAD ABOUT WHAT SHE DID.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.367
WHY MAKE HER FEEL WORSE?

13:54.401 --> 13:56.403
SO YOU'RE JUST GOING TO LET HER
SUFFER WITH HER OWN GUILT?

13:56.436 --> 13:59.406
IT'S PIE, MAN.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.876
BOYSENBERRY. I DIDN'T
EVEN KNOW THAT EXISTED!

14:04.311 --> 14:06.513
LOOK, IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH
TO FIND SOMEONE GREAT,

14:06.546 --> 14:08.348
YOU DO WHAT YOU CAN
TO HOLD ON TO THEM.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.483
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
ABOUT THAT, RYDER.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.419
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS THROWING
AWAY THEIR RELATIONSHIPS,

14:12.452 --> 14:13.921
BUT I SAY YOU'VE
GOTTA WORK ON IT.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.389
I'M PRETTY SURE I'VE NEVER
HEARD YOU SAY THAT.

14:16.423 --> 14:20.060
- WELL, NOW I DO.
- WELL, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

14:20.093 --> 14:22.362
I'VE GOTTA GO UPSTAIRS
AND SKYPE WITH MY WOMAN.

14:22.395 --> 14:25.498
SHE'S GONNA DO MY MATH HOMEWORK FOR
ME, THEN WATCH ME FALL ASLEEP.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.369
THERE REALLY IS
SOMEBODY FOR EVERYONE.

14:29.402 --> 14:32.372
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU AND THIS WHOLE
NEW SUNNY OUTLOOK ON RELATIONSHIPS?

14:32.405 --> 14:34.174
WEREN'T YOU JUST OUT
DUMPING DONALD?

14:34.207 --> 14:36.109
NO. I SAW SOMETHING
IN DONALD TONIGHT

14:36.143 --> 14:37.978
THAT I HADN'T
REALLY SEEN BEFORE.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.879
OH YEAH? WHAT WAS THAT?

14:39.913 --> 14:42.515
HE WAS DIFFERENT. HE WAS COOL.
HE WAS SELF-ASSURED.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.618
I CAN'T REALLY EXPLAIN IT,
BUT HE WAS JUST SO...

14:45.652 --> 14:49.156
- ME?
- NO, HE WAS NOTHING LIKE YOU.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.858
I LIKED HIM. HE WAS TAKE-CHARGE.
HE WAS CONFIDENT.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.060
YEAH? YOU KNOW WHY
HE WAS CONFIDENT?

14:53.093 --> 14:54.527
BECAUSE I TAUGHT HIM
TO BE CONFIDENT.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.996
NO, HE WAS CONFIDENT

14:56.029 --> 14:57.630
BECAUSE OF ALL THE JOB
OFFERS HE'S BEEN GETTING.

14:57.664 --> 15:00.033
- WHY DO YOU THINK HE'S GETTING ALL THESE JOB OFFERS?
- OH, I'M SORRY.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.170
WERE YOU IN THE INTERVIEWS WITH HIM
WITH YOUR HAND UP HIS PUPPET-HOLE?

15:03.203 --> 15:06.306
HE'S BEEN GETTING THE JOB OFFERS BECAUSE
I PUT HIM THROUGH A CRASH COURSE

15:06.339 --> 15:09.176
- AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN LONGO.
- OH REALLY?

15:09.209 --> 15:13.246
WHAT'S YOUR SCHOOL CHEER?
"WE ARE FULL OF CRAP!"

15:15.582 --> 15:17.284
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WILL PROVE IT TO YOU.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.252
GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE
OF CONFIDENT DONALD.

15:19.286 --> 15:22.155
OKAY, TONIGHT AT DINNER I
WANTED THE STEAK SANDWICH,

15:22.189 --> 15:24.557
BUT THE WAITER SAID THAT THAT'S
A LUNCH ITEM, SO DONALD...

15:24.591 --> 15:28.061
CALLED FOR THE MANAGER AND GAVE HIM THE
"WHAT MY WOMAN WANTS, SHE GETS" SPEECH.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.530
- HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?
- IT'S MY SPEECH!

15:30.563 --> 15:33.433
I TAUGHT HIM THAT SPEECH. YOU'RE
GOING OUT WITH A GUY THAT I TRAINED.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.935
HE'S USING ALL MY MOVES.
FACE IT, BURKE...

15:35.969 --> 15:39.506
YOU ARE DATING JOE LONGO.

15:39.539 --> 15:43.410
NO. YOU... IT'S...

15:43.443 --> 15:45.245
- YOU...
- EXACTLY.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.447
ME. ME!

15:57.257 --> 15:58.658
HEY.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.594
SOMEBODY ORDER A
DONALD, STRAIGHT UP?

16:01.628 --> 16:03.997
- HEY YOU.
- READY FOR DINNER?

16:04.031 --> 16:05.698
ALMOST.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.071
- ARE YOU READY NOW?
- UH-HUH.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.940
I'M TAKING YOU TO A
GREAT THAI RESTAURANT.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.209
OH, I WAS REALLY
CRAVING CHINESE.

16:16.243 --> 16:19.312
- MMM, I THINK YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR MIND.
- I DON'T THINK I WILL.

16:19.346 --> 16:23.050
- I'M BETTING YOU'LL COME AROUND.
- WOW, YOU HAVE SUCH AN EGO.

16:23.083 --> 16:26.086
- AND IT WORKS FOR ME, DOESN'T IT?
- I CAN'T STAND IT.

16:29.756 --> 16:32.392
- SO THAI IT IS?
- OH YEAH.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.727
OH, SORRY TO INTERRUPT, MS.
BURKE,

16:34.761 --> 16:36.529
BUT THE CITY ATTORNEY
IS ON THE PHONE.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.731
- OH, TELL HIM I'M BUSY MAKING OUT.
- OKAY.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.733
NO, I WAS JUST KIDDING!
PUT HIM THROUGH.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.136
I'LL BE OUT THERE
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.673
SAVE SOME OF THOSE
FOR AFTER DINNER.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.211
HOW DO YOU TYPE SO FAST? YOU
MUST HAVE MAGIC FINGERS.

16:51.244 --> 16:54.614
NO, I THINK THEY'RE
JUST REGULAR FINGERS.

16:54.647 --> 16:57.684
WELL, THEY ARE THE PRETTIEST
REGULAR FINGERS I'VE EVER SEEN.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.486
YOU COULD BE A HAND MODEL.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.454
- DONALD?
- YEAH.

17:01.488 --> 17:04.691
- YOU READY?
- YEAH, WHAT WAS THAT?

17:04.724 --> 17:06.593
JUST MAKING A LADY SMILE.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.696
NOW LET'S GO SEE IF I
CAN MAKE YOU SMILE.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.738
( dramatic music plays,
screaming on TV )

17:20.740 --> 17:23.743
I'M SO GLAD YOU WANTED TO WATCH
"ZOMBIE ACADEMY 4: SENIOR YEAR."

17:23.776 --> 17:26.313
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE
INTO THESE KIND OF MOVIES.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.648
I LIKE WHATEVER YOU
LIKE, SWEETIE.

17:28.681 --> 17:32.018
- ( chainsaw whirrs )
- WHOA!

17:32.051 --> 17:35.155
NO MORE TORSO FOR THAT GUY.

17:35.188 --> 17:38.191
OH MY. SO, RYDER,

17:38.225 --> 17:41.728
IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN KEEP WATCHING THE
MOVIE AND I'LL MASSAGE YOUR FEET.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.397
SOCKS OR NO SOCKS?

17:47.100 --> 17:49.802
NO SOCKS, IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU'D LIKE.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.772
HOLLY, YOU'RE THE BEST.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.708
OH, UM, I'M NOT THAT GREAT.

17:55.742 --> 17:59.646
ARE YOU KIDDING? YOU'RE THE GREATEST
GIRLFRIEND A GUY'S EVER HAD.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.149
NO NO, RYDER. I'M NOT!

18:02.182 --> 18:03.816
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.253
I HAVE A TERRIBLE
CONFESSION TO MAKE:

18:06.286 --> 18:09.756
I HAVE KISSED THE
LIPS OF ANOTHER.

18:11.358 --> 18:14.227
WHAT?! NO, HOLLY,
THAT CANNOT BE TRUE!

18:14.261 --> 18:16.796
YOU COULD NEVER HAVE
KISSED TIM LOGAN!

18:19.166 --> 18:21.100
WHO SAID TIM LOGAN?

18:21.134 --> 18:23.503
NO ONE. I JUST TOOK A SHOT,

18:23.536 --> 18:25.805
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE'S SO CUTE.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.375
YOU KNEW!

18:28.408 --> 18:30.410
YOU KNEW THIS WHOLE TIME!
( gasps )

18:30.443 --> 18:32.812
AND YOU LET ME BE NICE TO YOU!

18:32.845 --> 18:35.282
- I'M SORRY...
- LENNOX!

18:35.315 --> 18:38.251
- YOU TOLD RYDER? YOU SWORE YOU WOULDN'T!
- WHAT?

18:38.285 --> 18:41.788
- I DIDN'T SAY SQUAT.
- I MASSAGED HIS NAKED FOOT FOR NOTHING!

18:41.821 --> 18:44.691
TELL HIM HOW WRONG IT WAS TO
EXPLOIT AN INNOCENT GIRL.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.860
INNOCENT? YOU TRIED TO
INHALE TIM LOGAN'S FACE.

18:47.894 --> 18:51.498
HEY, WATCH WHAT YOU SAY. THAT'S
MY GIRLFRIEND YOU'RE TALKING TO.

18:51.531 --> 18:55.101
YOU'RE DEFENDING HER? WOW,
YOU TWO DESERVE EACH OTHER.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.804
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU MR.
AND MRS. WHACK-JOB.

19:00.573 --> 19:03.343
OH, YOU ARE IN SO
MUCH TROUBLE, MISTER.

19:03.376 --> 19:04.844
NOW PUT YOUR SOCK BACK ON.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.754
- HEY.
- HEY.

19:14.787 --> 19:17.890
THAT WAS A QUICK DATE.
MAN, YOU'RE EASY.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.727
I PULLED THE TRIGGER.
I DUMPED DONALD.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.363
YOU DUMPED HIM? WHAT HAPPENED
TO WORKING THINGS OUT?

19:23.396 --> 19:25.465
YOU CAN'T WORK THINGS
OUT WITH AN EGOMANIAC.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.800
HE WAS HORRIBLE, SMUG, ARROGANT.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.303
YOU'RE RIGHT, JOE. HE IS YOU.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.605
WAIT A MINUTE, I THOUGHT YOU
SAID THAT HE WASN'T ME.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.375
THAT WAS BEFORE
YOU ASSIFIED HIM.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.610
AT DINNER, DONALD TOLD ME

19:37.644 --> 19:38.778
HE WAS TIED DOWN TO ONE
COMPANY FOR 10 YEARS...

19:38.811 --> 19:40.913
HE WON'T BE TIED
DOWN TO ONE LADY.

19:40.947 --> 19:44.317
HE ACTUALLY SAID, "WE CAN SEE EACH OTHER
AS LONG AS YOU KNOW I'M FREELANCE."

19:44.351 --> 19:46.919
- FREELANCE!
- WHAT?

19:46.953 --> 19:48.721
I HARDLY EVER SAY THAT...

19:48.755 --> 19:50.923
ANYMORE.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.793
WOW, I GAVE HIM ALL THAT CONFIDENCE
AND HE JUST TOOK IT TO THE DARK SIDE.

19:53.826 --> 19:56.296
HE WAS FLIRTING WITH
EVERYONE: THE RECEPTIONIST,

19:56.329 --> 19:58.565
THE WAITRESS, THE EFFEMINATE
VALET PARKING GUY.

19:58.598 --> 20:02.168
YOU RUINED HIM, JOE, AND WHAT COULD HAVE
BEEN A PERFECTLY GOOD RELATIONSHIP.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.605
POOR DONALD... WITH GREAT POWER
COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY.

20:05.638 --> 20:08.741
I GUESS I JUST BROUGHT
HIM ALONG TOO QUICKLY.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.243
OH WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:10.277 --> 20:13.746
- FOR WHAT?
- FOR WHAT? A FEW WEEKS AGO,

20:13.780 --> 20:17.550
A LADY CAME TO ME AND SAID, "JOE,
ZEN MASTER, MIRACLE WORKER,

20:17.584 --> 20:20.287
WILL YOU PLEASE HELP ME GET
DONALD A JOB SO I CAN DUMP HIM?"

20:20.320 --> 20:22.955
AND TWO WEEKS LATER, DONALD GOT
A JOB AND YOU GOT TO DUMP HIM.

20:22.989 --> 20:26.826
- MIRACLE ACCOMPLISHED.
- OH, SO THAT WAS YOUR PLAN ALL ALONG?

20:26.859 --> 20:28.728
BURKE, THE POINT ISN'T
HOW WE GOT HERE.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.197
ALL RIGHT? IT'S
THAT WE'VE ARRIVED.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.301
OKAY, MUST YOU TURN EVERYTHING INTO
A REASON FOR SELF-CELEBRATION?

20:34.334 --> 20:37.970
I'M JUST SAYING THAT ONE DAY MAYBE
YOU'LL START DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT,

20:38.004 --> 20:40.773
AND THEN YOU'LL KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO BE IN MY WORLD.

20:40.807 --> 20:44.377
WHAT'S IN YOUR DUMPING
DOGGY BOX THERE?

20:44.411 --> 20:46.679
- CHICKEN SATAY.
- OOH, THAT LOOKS GOOD.

20:46.713 --> 20:49.449
YOU WANT SOME?
DUMP YOUR OWN GUY!

20:55.021 --> 20:58.725
HEY, JOE, I NEED YOUR HELP AND
I CAN'T TALK TO AUNT MEL.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.727
I GET IT... GUY STUFF, HUH?

21:00.760 --> 21:03.696
SIT DOWN. WHAT'S UP?

21:03.730 --> 21:06.333
TEACH ME HOW TO BAKE A PIE.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.668
HOLLY FOUND OUT YOU
KNEW, DIDN'T SHE?

21:08.701 --> 21:11.270
YEP.

21:11.304 --> 21:13.973
SO NO MORE HER DOING YOUR
HOMEWORK, NO MORE MASSAGES?

21:14.006 --> 21:16.976
NO MORE A LOT OF THINGS.

21:17.009 --> 21:20.313
AND ORDER IS RESTORED.

21:20.347 --> 21:22.949
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.
TIME TO MAN UP, DUDE.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.617
PUT ON YOUR APRON.
