11:42.102 --> 11:43.333
HE´S GONNA MARRY HER,

11:43.333 --> 11:45.736
PUT A BIG INSURANCE POLICY
ON HER HEAD,

11:45.736 --> 11:47.978
AND LET THE CIGARETTES
DO THEIR WORK.

11:49.309 --> 11:52.112
WHAT IF HE REALLY
LOVES HER?

11:52.112 --> 11:55.145
"WHAT IF HE REALLY
LOVES HER?"

11:55.145 --> 11:56.286
¿ESTáS LOCA?

11:56.286 --> 11:59.950
WHAT IF HE REALLY
LOVES HER?

11:59.950 --> 12:01.752
WELL, THEN, I WAS WRONG,

12:01.752 --> 12:04.194
AND I RUINED THE REMAINDER
OF MY MOM´S LIFE.

12:04.194 --> 12:05.956
SO?

12:05.956 --> 12:10.430
SO, YOU BETTER BE DAMN SURE
YOU´RE RIGHT ABOUT RANDY.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.402
OH, AND HERE´S
ANOTHER THING.

12:12.402 --> 12:14.404
IF SHE´S ALONE
IN HER OLD AGE,

12:14.404 --> 12:16.266
SHE´S GONNA END UP LIVING HERE

12:16.266 --> 12:18.839
IN THIS HOUSE
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.341
AND YOUR NEXT WIFE
IS NOT GONNA LIKE THAT.

12:21.341 --> 12:25.075
SALMA WOULDN´T MIND.

12:25.075 --> 12:29.279
SALMA SAID EXTENDED FAMILY
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HER.

12:29.279 --> 12:30.520
SALMA?

12:30.520 --> 12:32.122
SALMA HAYEK...

12:34.384 --> 12:37.227
MY SECOND WIFE.

12:37.227 --> 12:40.530
I´LL WALK IN WITH HAIR
LIKE THIS AND...

12:40.530 --> 12:41.992
[ YELLS IN SPANISH ]

12:41.992 --> 12:44.264
I´M GEORGE HAYEK.

12:47.467 --> 12:51.001
THAT´S RIGHT.
YOU DON´T KNOW.

12:51.001 --> 12:53.203
SHE COULD LOVE ME.

13:03.413 --> 13:05.515
HEY, RANDY,
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

13:05.515 --> 13:07.117
SURE.

13:07.117 --> 13:09.820
I WAS JUST SHARING A LITTLE
MISERY WITH SHELLY HERE.

13:09.820 --> 13:12.022
TEQUILA.

13:12.022 --> 13:13.423
SO, WHAT´S UP, GEORGE?

13:13.423 --> 13:15.565
LOOK, I KNOW YOU AND MY MOM
BROKE UP, ALL RIGHT?

13:15.565 --> 13:17.227
BUT I CAN´T TAKE THE CHANCE

13:17.227 --> 13:20.000
OF YOU TWO GUYS FIGHTING
ON THE FACTORY FLOOR AGAIN.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.303
I TRIED TO KEEP MY PERSONAL
FEELINGS OUT OF THIS,

13:23.303 --> 13:24.474
BUT I COULDN´T.

13:24.474 --> 13:27.037
SO I´M GONNA FIRE
MY MOM LATER.

13:27.037 --> 13:28.138
WHAT?

13:28.138 --> 13:30.240
ARE YOU CRAZY?

13:30.240 --> 13:32.282
BENNY´S BEEN THERE
OVER 35 YEARS.

13:32.282 --> 13:34.244
IF YOU GOTTA FIRE SOMEBODY,
FIRE ME.

13:34.244 --> 13:36.546
LOOK, I CAN´T AFFORD
TO LOSE YOU, RANDY.

13:36.546 --> 13:38.588
AND GINA´S GONNA DO
MY MOM´S WORK.

13:38.588 --> 13:40.921
HEY, WHAT ABOUT GINA, HUH?

13:40.921 --> 13:43.453
SHE´S EVEN OLDER
THAN MY MOM.

13:43.453 --> 13:47.597
NICE CONDO AT THE MARINA,
BRAND-NEW TITANIUM HIPS.

13:47.597 --> 13:51.862
LOOK, BENNY
DOESN´T DESERVE THIS.

13:51.862 --> 13:55.605
IF YOU DON´T WANT
TO FIRE ME, I QUIT.

13:55.605 --> 13:58.268
SO YOU´D ACTUALLY QUIT
FOR HER?

13:58.268 --> 13:59.609
I JUST DID.

13:59.609 --> 14:03.343
I WOULD DO ANYTHING
FOR THAT WOMAN, GEORGE.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.115
I LOVE HER SO MUCH.

14:05.115 --> 14:10.180
IF I COULD, I´D LOCK HER
IN A CAGE AND SHOW HER OFF...

14:10.180 --> 14:14.324
LIKE AN EXOTIC BIRD THAT NO
HUMAN HAND SHOULD EVER SOIL.

14:20.130 --> 14:22.392
HEY, RANDY, IF I HELP YOU
GET HER BACK,

14:22.392 --> 14:25.966
DO YOU PROMISE ME THAT YOU
WILL LOCK HER IN A CAGE?

14:27.037 --> 14:28.899
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU´RE NOT FIRING HER?

14:28.899 --> 14:30.540
I WAS JUST MAKING SURE
YOU WERE FOR REAL.

14:30.540 --> 14:31.871
OKAY? I´M SORRY.

14:35.145 --> 14:37.377
RANDY, YOUR EX
JUST WALKED IN.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.550
ALL RIGHT, JUST LET ME
TAKE CARE OF THIS.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.617
I WANT HIM
OUT OF THIS BAR.

14:47.617 --> 14:49.159
THIS IS MY BAR!

14:49.159 --> 14:52.622
EVERYTHING CAN´T ALWAYS
BE YOUR WAY, BENNY!

14:54.925 --> 14:57.467
LOOK, HE´S GOT JUST AS MUCH
RIGHT TO BE HERE

14:57.467 --> 15:00.200
AS YOU DO, MOM.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.631
NO!

15:01.631 --> 15:03.203
GEORGE, THIS IS WHERE I COME
TO FORGET MY PROBLEMS.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.635
I DON´T WANT TO SEE HIM
HERE.

15:05.635 --> 15:08.939
I´VE BEEN COMING HERE
SINCE HE WAS IN DIAPERS,

15:08.939 --> 15:10.640
SINCE YOU WERE IN DIAPERS.

15:10.640 --> 15:14.384
I EVEN CHANGED YOUR DIAPERS
ON THIS POOL TABLE.

15:14.384 --> 15:18.248
I USED TO POWDER YOUR BUTT
WITH THE BLUE CHALK.

15:23.093 --> 15:25.195
EVERY STORY
MAKES ME CLOSER TO YOU.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.260
THIS GUY REALLY CARES
ABOUT YOU, MOM.

15:30.260 --> 15:32.702
YOU´RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.
YOU´RE BLOWING THIS.

15:32.702 --> 15:34.264
YOU KNOW, GEORGE,

15:34.264 --> 15:37.307
HE´S THE ONE WHO GAVE UP
HIS GOOD THING, OKAY?

15:37.307 --> 15:40.140
HE KNOWS WHERE TO FIND IT
IF HE WANTS IT.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.572
LOOK, MOM,
HE´S NOT GONNA DO THAT.

15:42.572 --> 15:44.644
YOU GOTTA GIVE HIM
SOMETHING.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.546
SHOW HIM THAT YOU CARE.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.677
WELL, MAYBE I DON´T CARE.

15:47.677 --> 15:49.449
OH, YOU DON´T CARE?

15:49.449 --> 15:52.322
SO IF SHELLY´S BEEN HITTING
ON HIM FOR THE LAST HOUR,

15:52.322 --> 15:54.684
AND HE´S GONNA TAKE HER OUT
ON SATURDAY NIGHT,

15:54.684 --> 15:56.286
THAT WOULDN´T BOTHER YOU?

15:56.286 --> 15:58.158
BIG DEAL.

16:02.032 --> 16:03.663
I NEED A SMOKE.

16:06.436 --> 16:09.699
RANDY, I THINK I´M GETTING
THROUGH TO HER.

16:09.699 --> 16:13.403
SO OPEN UP THAT CAGE DOOR
AND SOIL YOURSELF.

16:15.345 --> 16:17.707
YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU WERE
SAYING WITH THE...

16:23.613 --> 16:26.156
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO RANDY´S TRUCK?

16:26.156 --> 16:28.388
WARMING UP
FOR RANDY´S HEAD!

16:30.460 --> 16:33.993
HOW COULD HE DO THIS TO ME?!
WE JUST BROKE UP!

16:33.993 --> 16:36.426
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN´T CARE
ABOUT HIM.

16:36.426 --> 16:37.597
I DON´T!

16:37.597 --> 16:40.100
RANDY´S NOT GOING OUT
WITH SHELLY.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.501
I JUST MADE THAT UP!

16:41.501 --> 16:42.672
WHAT?!

16:42.672 --> 16:44.704
LOOK, I WANTED TO PROVE
SOMETHING.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.776
YOU WOULDN´T BE GOING CRAZY
LIKE THIS

16:46.776 --> 16:48.508
IF YOU DIDN´T CARE
ABOUT HIM.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.110
GET OVER HERE.

16:50.110 --> 16:53.283
I WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW
MUCH I CARE ABOUT YOU.

16:55.215 --> 16:59.089
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BEAT UP
ON THE PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT?

16:59.089 --> 17:00.520
I´LL TELL YOU WHY.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.093
´CAUSE I´M GONNA GET THEM
BEFORE THEY GET ME.

17:03.093 --> 17:05.755
SO, WHAT, YOU THINK RANDY´S
GONNA BE LIKE MY DAD WAS?

17:05.755 --> 17:07.757
YOU THINK HE´S GONNA RUN
OUT ON YOU

17:07.757 --> 17:09.329
AND TREAT YOU LIKE CRAP?

17:09.329 --> 17:12.202
SOONER OR LATER,
THAT´S WHAT THEY ALL DO.

17:12.202 --> 17:14.804
SO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHAT IF YOU´RE WRONG?

17:14.804 --> 17:18.338
WHAT IF HE´S JUST
A GOOD GUY?

17:20.740 --> 17:22.512
THEN I DON´T KNOW.

17:23.113 --> 17:25.215
MY TRUCK!
WHAT HAPPENED?!

17:25.215 --> 17:28.478
SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE
FLIRTING WITH SHELLY.

17:28.478 --> 17:29.479
SHE´S CRAZY.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.483
YOU DESTROYED MY TRUCK,

17:33.483 --> 17:36.786
YOU CRAZY, PINT-SIZED,
MEXICAN GROUNDHOG?

17:42.132 --> 17:44.834
YOU DO LOVE ME.

17:44.834 --> 17:48.768
YEAH, I WAS GONNA SMASH UP
YOUR WINDSHIELD,

17:48.768 --> 17:51.141
AND GEORGE WOULDN´T LET ME.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.279
MARRY ME.

18:01.151 --> 18:02.852
DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:02.852 --> 18:04.814
SHE´S STILL GOT
THE TIRE IRON.

18:04.814 --> 18:05.855
OKAY.

18:05.855 --> 18:07.787
OKAY WHAT?

18:07.787 --> 18:10.790
OKAY, I´LL MARRY YOU.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.192
WHAT?

18:14.564 --> 18:15.665
OOH!

18:17.427 --> 18:21.271
GEORGE, YOU FINALLY GOT
YOURSELF A REAL DAD!

18:25.135 --> 18:28.408
RANDY, I´M NOT READY
TO TAKE IT TO THIS LEVEL.

18:50.700 --> 18:53.633
DO WE REALLY HAVE TO GO OUT
TO DINNER WITH THEM?

18:53.633 --> 18:56.436
GEORGE, THIS IS HUGE.
YOUR MOM JUST GOT ENGAGED.

18:56.436 --> 18:57.737
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE.

19:02.612 --> 19:05.575
EVENING, GEORGE.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.250
RANDY.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.752
OH, YOU LOOK SO HANDSOME.

19:12.752 --> 19:16.556
DOESN´T HE, GEORGE?

19:16.556 --> 19:19.889
WE ALREADY WENT THROUGH THIS.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.593
IS BENNY HERE?

19:23.593 --> 19:24.734
OH, YEAH.

19:24.734 --> 19:26.796
SHE´S UPSTAIRS
GETTING CHANGED.

19:26.796 --> 19:28.698
SHE´LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

19:36.446 --> 19:37.877
SO, JUNIOR...

YOU KNOW WHAT?
UM...

20:03.233 --> 20:05.675
WE´RE GONNA GIVE YOU GUYS
A MINUTE.

20:05.675 --> 20:07.807
WE´LL JUST BE
IN THE LIVING ROOM.
