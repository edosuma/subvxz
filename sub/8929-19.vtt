You mean we gotta wear these fur coats day and night?

07:05.702 --> 07:08.703
Ah! No. Energon will build up.

07:08.804 --> 07:11.904
If the Preds attack, you'll have less fight time.

We must fight it.

07:49.410 --> 07:52.344
Tigatron! He must've dealt with this.

07:52.444 --> 07:54.778
I sent a message by laser.

Hear me, fellow Maximals.

15:50.357 --> 15:52.724
( heavy breathing )

15:55.091 --> 15:58.858
I know you are frightened. But I can help you.

16:14.594 --> 16:16.194
Hmm.

16:16.294 --> 16:17.661
That's better.

16:17.761 --> 16:21.729
Now listen well. And learn.

16:26.496 --> 16:28.363
Oh, come on.

16:28.463 --> 16:32.130
You can't tell me old Megs would have forgotten a booby trap.

16:40.465 --> 16:43.165
Oh. You gotta love him.

16:43.266 --> 16:46.699
Now, if only Stripes is doing okay.

16:46.799 --> 16:51.333
Once, we were merely robots in disguise.

16:51.433 --> 16:53.001
But on this planet,

16:53.101 --> 16:56.201

17:50.809 --> 17:54.144
Ah. Yes.

17:54.244 --> 17:56.244
I understand.

17:56.344 --> 17:58.945
Rat, robot. Rat, robot.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.212
Heh. I'm a robot and a rat.

18:01.312 --> 18:05.178
Heh-Heh. Yeah. Yeah, I like it.

18:05.279 --> 18:07.913
Hmph. I do not see why.

18:08.013 --> 18:10.346
Unh. I get it now.

18:10.446 --> 18:12.947
Ah, thanks, Tigatron. ( explosion )

18:13.047 --> 18:15.347
Whoa! And talk about your nick of time.

18:15.447 --> 18:20.182
Remember. Do not fight your beast instincts.

18:20.282 --> 18:22.815
Let them help your robot forms.

18:22.916 --> 18:26.949
Both in battle and in peace.

18:27.049 --> 18:32.017
But for now, let us maximize.

18:32.117 --> 18:34.183
And slag some butt!

18:34.284 --> 18:37.018
( all chattering )

18:37.118 --> 18:38.418
OPTIMAL: All right, let's do it!

( mysterious theme playing )

18:42.285 --> 18:45.252
( pounding tribal beat )

18:51.420 --> 18:53.754
Uh-oh.

18:55.321 --> 18:56.854
( yelling )

19:02.888 --> 19:04.155
( screams )

19:07.023 --> 19:09.023
( roars )

19:09.123 --> 19:10.857
( snarls )

19:12.323 --> 19:14.124
( screams )

19:15.791 --> 19:17.858
( both gasp )

19:17.958 --> 19:20.025
( roars )

19:20.125 --> 19:21.258
( grunts )

19:29.626 --> 19:32.760
Heh. Didn't expect that, did you?

19:32.860 --> 19:34.127
Huh?

19:36.260 --> 19:37.827
( grunting )

19:43.162 --> 19:44.695
( yells )

19:47.763 --> 19:49.063

( dramatic rock theme playing )

19:54.430 --> 19:56.797
( grunting )

20:01.332 --> 20:03.566
( grunting )

20:04.699 --> 20:07.033
Unh! Energon buildup.

20:07.133 --> 20:11.233
The hunt has gone too long. Predacons, retreat!

20:14.367 --> 20:15.833
( screeches )

20:20.535 --> 20:22.035
All right!

20:22.135 --> 20:26.403
Beast or bot, we're still the baddest. Yeah!

20:26.503 --> 20:29.202
( cries )

20:29.303 --> 20:32.970
And it looks like things will be back to normal.

20:33.070 --> 20:35.037
Maybe even better.

20:35.137 --> 20:37.470
( all roaring and cheering )
